the

text
presented
in
this

is
taken
from
that
of
a
leyden
edition
of
in

words
from
that
of
an
edition
published
in
the

and
in
the
place
of
issue
of
the
first
edition
the
title
page
of
this
edition
is
reproduced
in
the
present
volume
the
original
was
evidently
the
work
of
a
dutch
compositor
unschooled
in
the
french
language
and
is
full
of
imperfections
inconsistencies
and
grammatical
blunders
by
the
direction
of
the
publishers
these
obviously
typographical
blunders
have
been
corrected
by
lucien
arr√©at
of

the
translation
is
the
work
of
several
hands
it
is
founded
on
a
version
made
by
miss
gertrude
bussey
from
the
french
text
in
the
edition
of
assezat
and
has
been
revised
by
professor
calkins
who
is
responsible
for
it
in
its
present
form
mademoiselle
carret
of
the
wellesley
college
department
of
french
and
professor
george
santayana
of
harvard
university
have
given
valued
assistance
and
this
opportunity
is
taken
to
acknowledge
their
kindness
in
solving
the
problems
of
interpretation
which
have
been
submitted
to
them
it
should
be
added
that
the
translation
sometimes
subordinates
the
claims
of
english
structure
and
style
in
the
effort
to
render
la
meaning
exactly
the
paragraphing
of
the
french
is
usually
followed
but
the
italics
and
the
capitals
are
not

the
great
eulogy
on
julien
offray
de
la
mettrie
julien
offray
de
la
mettrie
was
born
in
saint
malo
on
the
of
december
to
julien
offray
de
la
mettrie
and
marie
gaudron
who
were
living
by
a
trade
large
enough
to
provide
a
good
education
for
their
son
they
sent
him
to
the
college
of
coutance
to
study
the
humanities
he
went
from
there
to
paris
to
the
college
of
plessis
he
studied
his
rhetoric
at
caen
and
since
he
had
much
genius
and
imagination
he
won
all
the
prizes
for
eloquence
he
was
a
born
orator
and
was
passionately
fond
of
poetry
and
but
his
father
thought
that
he
would
earn
more
as
an
ecclesiastic
than
as
a
poet
and
destined
him
for
the
church
he
sent
him
the
following
year
to
the
college
of
plessis
where
he
studied
logic
under
cordier
who
was
more
a
jansenist
than
a
logician
it
is
characteristic
of
an
ardent
imagination
to
seize
forcefully
the
objects
presented
to
it
as
it
is
characteristic
of
youth
to
be
prejudiced
in
favor
of
the
first
opinions
that
are
inculcated
any
other
scholar
would
have
adopted
the
opinions
of
his
teacher
but
that
was
not
enough
for
young
la
mettrie
he
became
a
jansenist
and
wrote
a
work
which
had
great
vogue
in
that
party
in
he
studied
natural
philosophy
at
the
college
of
harcourt
and
made
great
progress
there
on
his
return
to
brittany
hunault
a
doctor
of
saint
malo
had
advised
him
to
adopt
the
medical
profession
they
had
persuaded
his
father
assuring
him
that
a
mediocre
physician
would
be
better
paid
for
his
remedies
than
a
good
priest
for
absolutions
at
first
young
la
mettrie
had
applied
himself
to
the
study
of
anatomy
for
two
years
he
had
worked
at
the
after
this
in
he
took
the
degree
of
doctor
at
rheims
and
was
there
received
as
a
physician
in
he
went
to
leyden
to
study
under
the
famous
boerhaave
the
master
was
worthy
of
the
scholar
and
the
scholar
soon
made
himself
worthy
of
the
master
la
mettrie
devoted
all
the
acuteness
of
his
mind
to
the
knowledge
and
to
the
healing
of
human
infirmities
and
he
soon
became
a
great
physician
in
the
year
during
his
leisure
moments
he
translated
a
treatise
of
the
late
boerhaave
his
aphrodisiacus
and
joined
to
it
a
dissertation
on
venereal
maladies
of
which
he
himself
was
the
author
the
old
physicians
in
france
rose
up
against
a
scholar
who
affronted
them
by
knowing
as
much
as
they
one
of
the
most
celebrated
doctors
of
paris
did
him
the
honor
of
criticizing
his
work
a
sure
proof
that
it
was
good
la
mettrie
replied
and
to
confound
his
adversary
still
more
he
composed
in
a
treatise
on
vertigo
esteemed
by
all
impartial
physicians
by
an
unfortunate
effect
of
human
imperfection
a
certain
base
jealousy
has
come
to
be
one
of
the
characteristics
of
men
of
letters
this
feeling
incites
those
who
have
reputations
to
oppose
the
progress
of
budding
geniuses
this
blight
often
fastens
on
talents
without
destroying
them
but
it
sometimes
injures
them
la
mettrie
who
was
advancing
in
the
career
of
science
at
a
giant
pace
suffered
from
this
jealousy
and
his
quick
temper
made
him
too
susceptible
to
it
in
saint
malo
he
translated
the
aphorisms
of
boerhaave
the
materia
medica
the
chemical
proceedings
the
chemical
theory
and
the
institutions
by
this
same
author
about
the
same
time
he
published
an
abstract
of
sydenham
the
young
doctor
had
learned
by
premature
experience
that
if
he
wished
to
live
in
peace
it
was
better
to
translate
than
to
compose
but
it
is
characteristic
of
genius
to
escape
from
reflection
counting
on
himself
alone
if
i
may
speak
thus
and
filled
with
the
knowledge
he
had
gained
from
his
infinitely
skilful
researches
into
nature
he
wished
to
communicate
to
the
public
the
useful
discoveries
he
had
made
he
published
his
treatise
on
smallpox
his
practical
medicine
and
six
volumes
of
commentary
on
the
physiology
of
boerhaave
all
these
works
appeared
at
paris
although
the
author
had
written
them
at
saint
malo
he
joined
to
the
theory
of
his
art
an
always
successful
practice
which
is
no
small
recommendation
for
a
physician
in
la
mettrie
came
to
paris
led
there
by
the
death
of
hunault
his
old
teacher
morand
and
sidobre
introduced
him
to
the
duke
of
gramont
who
a
few
days
after
obtained
for
him
the
commission
of
physician
of
the
guards
he
accompanied
the
duke
to
war
and
was
with
him
at
the
battle
of
dettingen
at
the
siege
of
freiburg
and
at
the
battle
of
fontenoy
where
he
lost
his
patron
who
was
killed
by
a
cannon
shot
la
mettrie
felt
this
loss
all
the
more
keenly
because
it
was
at
the
same
time
the
reef
on
which
his
fortune
was
wrecked
this
is
what
happened
during
the
campaign
of
freiburg
la
mettrie
had
an
attack
of
violent
fever
for
a
philosopher
an
illness
is
a
school
of
physiology
he
believed
that
he
could
clearly
see
that
thought
is
but
a
consequence
of
the
organization
of
the
machine
and
that
the
disturbance
of
the
springs
has
considerable
influence
on
that
part
of
us
which
the
metaphysicians
call
soul
filled
with
these
ideas
during
his
convalescence
he
boldly
bore
the
torch
of
experience
into
the
night
of
metaphysics
he
tried
to
explain
by
the
aid
of
anatomy
the
thin
texture
of
understanding
and
he
found
only
mechanism
where
others
had
supposed
an
essence
superior
to
matter
he
had
his
philosophic
conjectures
printed
under
the
title
of
the
natural
history
of
the
soul
the
chaplain
of
the
regiment
sounded
the
tocsin
against
him
and
at
first
sight
all
the
devotees
cried
out
against
him
the
common
ecclesiastic
is
like
don
quixote
who
found
marvelous
adventures
in
commonplace
events
or
like
the
famous
soldier
so
engrossed
with
his
system
that
he
found
columns
in
all
the
books
he
read
the
majority
of
priests
examine
all
works
of
literature
as
if
they
were
treatises
on
theology
and
filled
with
this
one
aim
they
discover
heresies
everywhere
to
this
fact
are
due
very
many
false
judgments
and
very
many
accusations
for
the
most
part
unfair
against
the
authors
a
book
of
physics
should
be
read
in
the
spirit
of
a
physicist
nature
the
truth
is
its
sole
judge
and
should
absolve
or
condemn
it
a
book
of
astronomy
should
be
read
in
the
same
manner
if
a
poor
physician
proves
that
the
blow
of
a
stick
smartly
rapped
on
the
skull
disturbs
the
mind
or
that
at
a
certain
degree
of
heat
reason
wanders
one
must
either
prove
the
contrary
or
keep
quiet
if
a
skilful
astronomer
proves
in
spite
of
joshua
that
the
earth
and
all
the
celestial
globes
revolve
around
the
sun
one
must
either
calculate
better
than
he
or
admit
that
the
earth
revolves
but
the
theologians
who
by
their
continual
apprehension
might
make
the
weak
believe
that
their
cause
is
bad
are
not
troubled
by
such
a
small
matter
they
insisted
on
finding
seeds
of
heresy
in
a
work
dealing
with
physics
the
author
underwent
a
frightful
persecution
and
the
priests
claimed
that
a
doctor
accused
of
heresy
could
not
cure
the
french
guards
to
the
hatred
of
the
devotees
was
joined
that
of
his
rivals
for
glory
this
was
rekindled
by
a
work
of
la
mettrie
entitled
the
politics
of
physicians
a
man
full
of
cunning
and
carried
away
by
ambition
aspired
to
the
place
then
vacant
of
first
physician
to
the
king
of
france
he
thought
that
he
could
gain
it
by
heaping
ridicule
upon
those
of
his
contemporaries
who
might
lay
claim
to
this
position
he
wrote
a
libel
against
them
and
abusing
the
easy
friendship
of
la
mettrie
he
enticed
him
to
lend
to
it
the
volubility
of
his
pen
and
the
richness
of
his
imagination
nothing
more
was
needed
to
complete
the
downfall
of
a
man
little
known
against
whom
were
all
appearances
and
whose
only
protection
was
his
merit
for
having
been
too
sincere
as
a
philosopher
and
too
obliging
as
a
friend
la
mettrie
was
compelled
to
leave
his
country
the
duke
of
duras
and
the
viscount
of
chaila
advised
him
to
flee
from
the
hatred
of
the
priests
and
the
revenge
of
the
physicians
therefore
in
he
left
the
hospitals
of
the
army
where
he
had
been
placed
by
sechelles
and
came
to
leyden
to
philosophize
in
peace
he
there
composed
his
penelope
a
polemical
work
against
the
physicians
in
which
after
the
fashion
of
democritus
he
made
fun
of
the
vanity
of
his
profession
the
curious
result
was
that
the
doctors
themselves
though
their
quackery
was
painted
in
true
colors
could
not
help
laughing
when
they
read
it
and
that
is
a
sure
sign
that
they
had
found
more
wit
than
malice
in
it
la
mettrie
after
losing
sight
of
his
hospitals
and
his
patients
gave
himself
up
completely
to
speculative
philosophy
he
wrote
his
man
a
machine
or
rather
he
put
on
paper
some
vigorous
thoughts
about
materialism
which
he
doubtless
planned
to
rewrite
this
work
which
was
bound
to
displease
men
who
by
their
position
are
declared
enemies
of
the
progress
of
human
reason
roused
all
the
priests
of
leyden
against
its
author
calvinists
catholics
and
lutherans
forgot
for
the
time
that
consubstantiation
free
will
mass
for
the
dead
and
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
divided
them
they
all
united
again
to
persecute
a
philosopher
who
had
the
additional
misfortune
of
being
french
at
a
time
when
that
monarchy
was
waging
a
successful
war
against
their
high
powers
the
title
of
philosopher
and
the
reputation
of
being
unfortunate
were
enough
to
procure
for
la
mettrie
a
refuge
in
prussia
with
a
pension
from
the
king
he
came
to
berlin
in
the
month
of
february
in
the
year
he
was
there
received
as
a
member
of
the
royal
academy
of
science
medicine
reclaimed
him
from
metaphysics
and
he
wrote
a
treatise
on
dysentery
another
on
asthma
the
best
that
had
then
been
written
on
these
cruel
diseases
he
sketched
works
on
certain
philosophical
subjects
which
he
had
proposed
to
look
into
by
a
sequence
of
accidents
which
befell
him
these
works
were
stolen
but
he
demanded
their
suppression
as
soon
as
they
appeared
la
mettrie
died
in
the
house
of
milord
tirconnel
minister
plenipotentiary
of
france
whose
life
he
had
saved
it
seems
that
the
disease
knowing
with
whom
it
had
to
deal
was
clever
enough
to
attack
his
brain
first
so
that
it
would
more
surely
confound
him
he
had
a
burning
fever
and
was
violently
delirious
the
invalid
was
obliged
to
depend
upon
the
science
of
his
colleagues
and
he
did
not
find
there
the
resources
which
he
had
so
often
found
in
his
own
both
for
himself
and
for
the
public
he
died
on
the
eleventh
of
november
at
the
age
of
years
he
had
married
louise
charlotte
dr√©ano
by
whom
he
left
only
a
daughter
five
years
and
a
few
months
old
la
mettrie
was
born
with
a
fund
of
natural
and
inexhaustible
gaiety
he
had
a
quick
mind
and
such
a
fertile
imagination
that
it
made
flowers
grow
in
the
field
of
medicine
nature
had
made
him
an
orator
and
a
philosopher
but
a
yet
more
precious
gift
which
he
received
from
her
was
a
pure
soul
and
an
obliging
heart
all
those
who
are
not
imposed
upon
by
the
pious
insults
of
the
theologians
mourn
in
la
mettrie

good
man

de
humaine
et
dans
leurs
recherches
ne
sont
pas
sur
ce
point
avec
les
th√©ologiens
le
davantage
sur
tous
les
autres
voici
en
peu
de
mots
le
r√©sultat
de
toutes
leurs
r√©flexions
y
a
un
dieu
il
est
auteur
de
la
nature
comme
de
la
r√©v√©lation
il
nous
a
donn√©
pour
expliquer
et
la
raison
pour
les
accorder
ensemble
se
d√©fier
des
connaissances
peut
puiser
dans
les
corps
anim√©s
regarder
la
nature
et
la
r√©v√©lation
comme
deux
contraires
qui
se
d√©truisent
et
par
cons√©quent
oser
soutenir
cette
absurdit√©
que
dieu
se
contredit
dans
ses
divers
ouvrages
et
nous
trompe
y
a
une
r√©v√©lation
elle
ne
peut
donc
d√©mentir
la
nature
par
la
nature
seule
on
peut
d√©couvrir
le
sens
des
paroles
de
dont
seule
est
la
v√©ritable
interpr√®te
en
effet
les
autres
commentateurs
fait
la
v√©rit√©
nous
allons
en
juger
par
du
spectacle
de
la
nature
il
est
√©tonnant
au
sujet
de
locke
homme
qui
d√©grade
notre
√¢me
la
croire
une
√¢me
de
boue
ose
√©tablir
la
raison
pour
juge
et
souverain
arbitre
des
myst√®res
de
la
foi
car
quelle
id√©e
√©tonnante
du
christianisme
si
voulait
suivre
la
raison
outre
que
ces
r√©flexions
rien
par
rapport
√†
la
foi
elles
forment
de
si
frivoles
objections
contre
la
m√©thode
de
ceux
qui
croient
pouvoir
interpr√©ter
les
livres
saints
que
presque
honte
de
perdre
le
temps
√†
les
r√©futer
de
la
raison
ne
d√©pend
pas
grand
mot
vide
de
sens
mais
de
sa
force
de
son
√©tendue
ou
de
sa
clairvoyance
ainsi
une
√¢me
de
boue
qui
d√©couvrirait
comme
coup
les
rapports
et
les
suites
infinit√©
difficiles
√†
saisir
serait
√©videmment
pr√©f√©rable
√†
une
√¢me
sotte
et
stupide
qui
serait
faite
des
√©l√©ments
les
plus
pr√©cieux
ce
pas
√™tre
philosophe
que
de
rougir
avec
pline
de
la
mis√®re
de
notre
origine
ce
qui
parait
vil
est
ici
la
chose
la
plus
pr√©cieuse
et
pour
laquelle
la
nature
semble
avoir
mis
le
plus
et
le
plus
mais
comme
quand
m√™me
il
viendrait
source
encore
plus
vile
en
apparence
serait
pas
moins
le
plus
parfait
de
tous
les
√™tres
quelle
que
soit
de
son
√¢me
si
elle
est
pure
noble
sublime
une
belle
√¢me
qui
rend
respectable
quiconque
en
est
dou√©
la
seconde
mani√®re
de
raisonner
de
pluche
me
parait
vicieuse
m√™me
dans
son
syst√®me
qui
tient
un
peu
du
fanatisme
car
si
nous
avons
une
id√©e
de
la
foi
qui
soit
contraire
aux
principes
les
plus
clairs
aux
v√©rit√©s
les
plus
incontestables
il
faut
croire
pour
de
la
r√©v√©lation
et
de
son
auteur
que
cette
id√©e
est
fausse
et
que
nous
ne
connaissons
point
encore
les
sens
des
paroles
de
de
deux
choses
ou
tout
est
illusion
tant
la
nature
m√™me
que
la
r√©v√©lation
ou
seule
peut
rendre
raison
de
la
foi
mais
quel
plus
grand
ridicule
que
celui
de
notre
auteur
je
entendre
un
p√©ripat√©ticien
qui
dirait
il
ne
faut
pas
croire
de
toricelli
car
si
nous
la
croyions
si
nous
allions
bannir
du
vide
quelle
√©tonnante
philosophie
fait
voir
combien
le
raisonnement
de
pluche
est
vicieux
afin
de
prouver
premi√®rement
que
y
a
une
r√©v√©lation
elle
point
suffisamment
d√©montr√©e
par
la
seule
autorit√©
de
et
sans
aucun
examen
de
la
raison
comme
le
pr√©tendent
tous
ceux
qui
la
craignent
secondement
pour
mettre
√†
de
toute
attaque
la
m√©thode
de
ceux
qui
voudraient
suivre
la
voie
que
je
leur
ouvre
les
choses
surnaturelles
incompr√©hensibles
en
soi
par
les
lumi√®res
que
chacun
a
re√ßues
de
la
nature
et
doivent
donc
seules
nous
guider
ici
elles
se
trouvent
sans
nombre
dans
les
fastes
des
m√©decins
qui
ont
√©t√©
philosophes
et
non
dans
les
philosophes
qui
pas
√©t√©
m√©decins
ont
parcouru
ont
√©clair√©
le
labyrinthe
de
ils
nous
ont
seuls
d√©voil√©
ces
ressorts
cach√©s
sous
des
enveloppes
qui
d√©robent
√†
nos
yeux
tant
de
merveilles
eux
seuls
contemplant
tranquillement
notre
√¢me
mille
fois
surprise
et
dans
sa
mis√®re
et
dans
sa
grandeur
sans
plus
la
m√©priser
dans
de
ces
√©tats
que
dans
encore
une
fois
voil√†
les
seuls
physiciens
qui
aient
droit
de
parler
ici
que
nous
diraient
les
autres
et
surtout
les
th√©ologiens
pas
ridicule
de
les
entendre
d√©cider
sans
pudeur
sur
un
sujet
point
√©t√©
√†
port√©e
de
conna√Ætre
dont
ils
ont
√©t√©
au
contraire
enti√®rement
d√©tourn√©s
par
des
√©tudes
obscures
qui
les
ont
conduits
√†
mille
pr√©jug√©s
et
pour
tout
dire
en
un
mot
au
fanatisme
qui
ajoute
encore
√†
leur
ignorance
dans
le
m√©canisme
des
corps
mais
quoique
nous
ayons
choisi
les
meilleurs
guides
nous
trouverons
encore
beaucoup
et
dans
cette
carri√®re
est
une
machine
si
compos√©e
est
impossible
de
faire
une
id√©e
claire
et
cons√©quemment
de
la
d√©finir
pourquoi
toutes
les
recherches
que
les
plus
grands
philosophes
ont
faites
√†
priori
√†
dire
en
voulant
se
servir
en
quelque
sorte
des
ailes
de
ont
√©t√©
vaines
ainsi
ce
posteriori
ou
en
cherchant
√†
dem√™ler
comme
au

les
organes
du
corps
peut
je
ne
dis
pas
d√©couvrir
avec
√©vidence
la
nature
m√™me
de
mais
atteindre
le
plus
grand
degr√©
de
probabilit√©
possible
sur
ce
sujet
prenons
donc
le
b√¢ton
de
et
laissons
l√†
de
toutes
les
vaines
opinions
des
philosophes
etre
aveugle
et
croire
pouvoir
se
passer
de
ce
b√¢ton
le
comble
de
moderne
a
bien

de
dire

ne

inutiles

quel
fruit
je
vous
prie
retir√©
de
leurs
profondes
m√©ditations
et
de
tous
leurs

commen√ßons
donc
et

non

mais
ce
faut
penser
pour
le
repos
de
la

autant
de
temp√©raments

de

de

des

et
des

en
g√©n√©ral
la
forme
et
la

du

des

est
√†
peu
pr√®s
la
m√™me
que
dans

m√™me
disposition
partout
avec
cette
diff√©rence
essentielle
que
est
de
tous

celui
qui
a
le

de

et
le

le

tortueux
en

de

le

les

qui
ressemblent
le

√†
car
on
remarque
aussi
chez

la
m√™me
analogie
gradu√©e
par
rapport
au
corps
calleux
dans
lequel
lancisi
avait
√©tabli
le

de

de

qui
cependant
a
illustr√©
cette
opinion
par
une

ce
sont
les

qui
ont
le

de

les

la

elle
est
vide
de
sens
comme
celle
de
bien
des

ils
point
de

calleux
et
fort
peu
de
cerveau
lequel
manque
aux

je
ne
me
r√©pandrai
point
en
un
plus
long
d√©tail
des
vari√©t√©s
de
la

ni
en
conjectures
car
les

et

sont
infinies
comme
on
en
peut
juger
en
lisant
les
seuls
trait√©s
de
willis
de

et
de
anima
brutorum
je
concl√ªrai
seulement
ce
qui
suit
clairement
de
ces
incontestables
observations
que
plus
les
animaux
sont
farouches
moins
ils
ont
de
cerveau
que
ce
visc√®re
semble
en
quelque
sorte
√†
proportion
de
leur
docilit√©
y
a
ici
une
singuli√®re
condition
impos√©e
√©ternellement
par
la
nature
qui
est
que
plus
on
gagnera
du
c√¥t√©
de
plus
on
perdra
du
c√¥t√©
de
lequel
de
la
perte
ou
du
gain
ne
croyez
pas
au
reste
que
je
veuille
pr√©tendre
par
l√†
que
le
seul
volume
du
cerveau
suffise
pour
faire
juger
du
degr√©
de
docilit√©
des
animaux
il
faut
que
la
qualit√©
r√©ponde
encore
√†
la
quantit√©
et
que
les
solides
et
les
fluides
soient
dans
cet
√©quilibre
convenable
qui
fait
la
sant√©
si
ne
manque
pas
de
cerveau
comme
on
le
remarque
ordinairement
ce
visc√®re
p√©chera
par
une
mauvaise
consistance
par
trop
de
mollesse
par
exemple
il
en
est
de
m√™me
des
fous
les
vices
de
leur
cerveau
ne
se
d√©robent
pas
toujours
√†
nos
recherches
mais
si
les
causes
de
de
la
folie
etc
ne
sont
pas
sensibles
o√π
aller
chercher
celles
de
la
vari√©t√©
de
tous
les
esprits
elles
√©chapperaient
aux
yeux
des
lynx
et
des
argus
un
rien
une
petite
fibre
quelque
chose
que
la
plus
subtile
anatomie
ne
peut
d√©couvrir
eut
fait
deux
sots
et
de
fontenelle
qui
le
remarque
lui
m√™me
dans
un
de
ses
meilleurs
dialogues
outre
la
mollesse
de
la
mo√´lle
du
cerveau
dans
les
enfants
dans
les
petits
chiens
et
dans
les
oiseaux
willis
a
remarqu√©
que
les
corps
cannel√©s
sont
effac√©s
et
comme
d√©color√©s
dans
tous
ces
animaux
et
que
leurs
stries
sont
aussi
imparfaitement
form√©es
que
dans
les
paralytiques
il
ajoute
ce
qui
est
vrai
que
a
la
protub√©rance
annulaire
fort
grosse
et
ensuite
toujours
diminutivement
par
d√©gr√©s
le
singe
et
les
autres
animaux
nomm√©s
tandis
que
le
veau
le
boeuf
le
loup
la
brebis
le
cochon
etc
qui
ont
cette
partie
tr√®s
petit
volume
ont
les
nattes
et
testes
fort
gros
on
a
beau
√™tre
discret
et
r√©serv√©
sur
les
cons√©quences
peut
tirer
de
ces
observations
et
de
tant
sur
des
vaisseaux
et
des
nerfs
etc
tant
de
vari√©t√©s
ne
peuvent
√™tre
des
jeux
gratuits
de
la
nature
elles
prouvent
du
moins
la
n√©cessit√©
bonne
et
abondante
organisation
puisque
dans
tout
le
r√®gne
animal
se
raffermissant
avec
le
corps
acquiert
de
la
sagacit√©
√†
mesure
prend
des
forces
√†
contempler
la
diff√©rente
docilit√©
des
animaux
sans
doute
la
mieux
entendue
conduit
√†
croire
que
les
causes
dont
nous
avons
fait
mention
produisent
toute
la
diversit√©
qui
se
trouve
et
nous
faille
avouer
que
notre
faible
entendement
born√©
aux
observations
les
plus
grossi√®res
ne
puisse
voir
les
liens
qui
r√®gnent
entre
la
cause
et
les
effets
une
esp√®ce
que
les
philosophes
ne
conna√Ætront
jamais
parmi
les
animaux
les
uns
apprennent
√†
parler
et
√†
chanter
ils
retiennent
des
airs
et
prennent
tous
les
tons
aussi
exactement
musicien
les
autres
qui
montrent
cependant
plus
tels
que
le
singe
peuvent
venir
√†
bout
pourquoi
cela
si
ce
par
un
vice
des
organes
de
la
parole
mais
ce
vice
tellement
de
conformation
puisse
apporter
aucun
rem√®de
en
un
mot
absolument
impossible
une
langue
√†
cet
animal
je
ne
le
crois
pas
je
prendrais
le
grand
singe
pr√©f√©rablement
√†
tout
autre
ce
que
le
hasard
nous
e√ªt
fait
d√©couvrir
quelque
autre
esp√®ce
plus
semblable
√†
la
n√¥tre
car
rien
ne
r√©pugne
y
en
ait
dans
des
r√©gions
qui
nous
sont
inconnues
cet
animal
nous
ressemble
si
fort
que
les
naturalistes
appel√©
homme
sauvage
ou
homme
des
bois
je
le
prendrais
aux
m√™mes
conditions
des
√©coliers
que
je
voudrais
ne
f√ªt
ni
trop
jeune
ni
trop
vieux
car
ceux
nous
apporte
en
europe
sont
commun√©ment
trop
√¢g√©s
je
choisirais
celui
qui
aurait
la
physionomie
la
plus
spirituelle
et
qui
tiendrait
le
mieux
dans
mille
petites
op√©rations
ce
promis
enfin
ne
me
trouvant
pas
digne
son
gouverneur
je
le
mettrais
√†
de
ma√Ætre
que
je
viens
de
nommer
ou
autre
aussi
habile
en
est
vous
savez
par
le
livre
et
par
tous
ceux
qui
ont
traduit
sa
m√©thode
tous
les
prodiges
a
su
op√©rer
sur
les
sourds
de
naissance
dans
les
yeux
desquels
il
a
comme
il
le
fait
entendre
trouv√©
des
oreilles
et
en
combien
peu
de
temps
enfin
il
leur
a
appris
√†
entendre
parler
lire
et
√©crire
je
veux
que
les
yeux
sourd
voient
plus
clair
et
soient
plus
intelligents
que
ne
pas
par
la
raison
que
la
perte
membre
ou
sens
peut
augmenter
la
force
ou
la
p√©n√©tration
autre
mais
le
singe
voit
et
entend
il
comprend
ce
entend
et
ce
voit
il
con√ßoit
si
parfaitement
les
signes
lui
fait
tout
autre
jeu
ou
tout
autre
exercice
je
ne
doute
point
ne
sur
les
disciples
pourquoi
donc
des
singes
impossible
pourquoi
ne
enfin
√†
force
de
soins
imiter
√†
des
sourds
les
mouvemens
n√©cessaires
pour
prononcer
je
d√©cider
si
les
organes
de
la
parole
du
singe
ne
peuvent
fasse
rien
articuler
mais
cette
impossibilit√©
absolue
me
surprendrait
√†
cause
de
la
grande
analogie
du
singe
et
de
et
point
connu
pr√©sent
dont
le
dedans
et
le
dehors
lui
ressemblent
mani√®re
si
frappante
locke
qui
certainement
jamais
√©t√©
suspect
de
cr√©dulit√©
pas
fait
difficult√©
de
croire
que
le

fait
dans

la
similitude
de

telle
que

enfin

de

alors
il
ne

du

que
comme
le

je

dire
par
une
physionomie
qui
annon√ßait

de

r√©duit
√†
la

intuitive
des

il
ne

que
des

sans

en

suivant
les

que

celui

le

√™tre
regard√©
comme

donc
la

ne

plus
pour
exceller
dans
des

dont
je

est

pour
juger
des

ce
sentiment
qui

est
insuffisant
pourquoi

de

un

du

rougira
int√©rieurement
de

diff√©rence
que
comme
chez

tout
est
immol√©
aux

aux

de

dont
ils
jouissent
plus
que

leurs

ne

√™tre

les

je
veux
pour

supposer

que

√†
ce

inhumain
que

de

on

la

dans

ne

la

de
tous

qui
commettent
des

m√™me
involontaires
ou
de
temp√©rament
de
gaston
qui
ne

de
certaine
femme
qui
fut
sujette
au

vice
dans

et
dont
ses

h√©rit√®rent
de
celle
qui
dans
le
m√™me
√©tat
mangea
son

de
cette
autre
qui
√©gorgeait
les

salait
leurs

et
en

tous

comme
du

√©lev√©e
par

de

sont
remplis
et
qui
prouvent
tous

mille
vices
et

h√©r√©ditaires
qui
passent
des

aux

comme
ceux
de
la

√†
ceux

je
dis
donc
et
que
ces
malheureux
ne

pas
pour
la

sur

la
boulimie
par

ou
la

√©teindre
tout

forc√©
de

√†
et
comme
d√©senivr√©es
quels

pour

qui
se

commis
dans

de

cher
quelle
punition
mal
involontaire
auquel
elles

r√©sister

pour
les

je
sens
tout
ce
que
demande
de

il
serait
sans

√†
souhaiter
e√ªt
pour
juges
que
m√©decins

seuls
pourraient
distinguer
le
criminel
innocent
du
coupable
si
la
raison
est
esclave

d√©prav√©
ou
en
fureur
comment
le
gouverner

si
le
crime
porte
avec
soi
sa
propre
punition
plus
ou
moins
cruelle
si
la

longue
et
la
plus
barbare

ne
peut
arracher
le

des

de

effrayer
des

le

des

quand

est
opprim√©e
par
un
exc√®s
de
force
et
de

en
cela
seul
que
la
vraie
m√©decine
consiste
le
corps
horloge
dont
le
nouveau
chyle
est
le
premier
soin
de
la
nature
quand
il
entre
dans
le

exciter
une
sorte
de
fi√®vre
que
les
chimistes
qui
ne
r√™vent
que
fourneaux
ont
d√ª
prendre
pour
une
fermentation
cette
fi√®vre
procure
une
plus
grande
filtration
qui
machinalement
vont
animer
les
muscles
et
le
coeur
comme
y
√©taient
envoy√©s
par
ordre
de

ce
sont
donc
les
causes

les
forces
de
la

entretiennent
ainsi
durant

le
mouvement
perp√©tuel
des
solides
et
des
fluides
aussi
n√©cessaire
aux

mais
qui
peut
dire
si
les
solides
contribuent
√†
ce
jeu
plus
que
les
fluides
et
vice

tout
ce
sait
que
des
premiers
serait
bient√¥t
an√©antie
sans
le
secours
des

ce
sont
les
liqueurs
qui
par
leur

√©veillent

conservent
des

d√©pend
leur

de

la

le
ressort
naturel
de
chaque
substance
est
plus

fort
encore
suivant
les
restes
de
la
vie
auxquels
il
survit
pour
expirer
le
dernier
tant
il
est
vrai
que
cette
force
des
parties
animales
peut
bien
se
conserver
et
par
celle
de
la
circulation
mais
d√©pend
point
se
passe
m√™me
de

comme
on

pas
que

go√ªt√©e
de

et
que
stahl
surtout
fort
d√©daign√©e
ce
grand
chimiste
a
voulu
nous
persuader
que
√©tait
la
seule
cause
de
tous
nos

mais
parler
en
fanatique
et
non
en
philosophe
pour
d√©truire
stahlienne
il
ne
faut
pas
faire
tant
que
je
vois
en

avant

il
a
jeter

je

plut√¥t
je
d√©fie
les

de

dire
eux

que

√†

√¥
bon
dieu
quels

faits
certains

eu
la
patience
de
lire
√†
ce
sujet
tout
ce
que
nous
apprend
que
tant
que
le

subsiste
si
petit
soit
dans
une

plusieurs
fibres
il
a
les
piquer
pour
r√©veiller
animer
ce
mouvement
presque
√©teint
comme
on
vu
dans
cette
foule
dont
voulu
accabler
les
syst√®mes
il
est
donc
constant
que
le
mouvement
et
le
sentiment
tour
√†
tour
et
dans

corps
entiers
et
dans

corps
dont

de
certaines

qui
semblent
nous
offrir
les

ph√©nom√®nes
de
la
r√©union
du

du

de
plus
combien

ont
d√©montr√©
que

facult√©
de

appliqu√©e
√†
contempler

√†

qui
serait
prouv√©
par

seul
que
lorsque
le

est
√©teint
la

aussi
comme
dans

en

devient
active

compos√©e
que
de

je

bonne
composition
sur

incompr√©hensibles
de

sur

seul

√†
la

incontestable
et
que
tout
d√©pend
dans
les

de
la
diversit√©
de
cette
organisation
comme
je
assez
prouv√©
est
assez
pour
deviner
des

et
celle
de

voit
en

et
que
est
la

parfaite
il
est
au

les
plus
spirituels
ce
que
le
pendule
plan√©taire
de

est
√†
une
montre
de

le

a
fallu
plus
plus
de

de

pour
marquer
les
mouvements
des
plan√®tes
que
pour
marquer
les
heures
ou
les
r√©p√©ter
a

plus
√†
vaucanson
pour

son

que
pour
son

il
e√ªt
d√ª
en

encore
davantage

un

machine
qui
ne

plus
√™tre
regard√©e
comme
impossible
surtout
entre

nouveau
prom√©th√©e
il
√©tait
donc
de
m√™me
n√©cessaire
que
la

employ√¢t
plus
et
pour
faire
et
entretenir
une
machine
qui
pendant

p√ªt
marquer
tous
les
battements
du

de

si
on
voit
pas
au

les

du

le
barom√®tre
de
la
chaleur
et
de
la
vivacit√©
par
laquelle
on
peut
juger
de
la

de
je
ne
me
trompe
point
le
corps
humain
est
une
horloge

immense
et
construite
avec
tant
et
que
si
la
roue
qui
sert
√†
marquer
les
secondes
vient
√†
celle
des
minutes
tourne
et
va
toujours
son
train
comme
la
roue
des

continue
de
se
mouvoir
et
ainsi
des
autres
quand
les
premi√®res
rouill√©es
ou
d√©rang√©es
par
quelque
cause
que
ce
soit
ont
interrompu
leur
marche
car
pas
ainsi
que
de
quelques
vaisseaux
ne
suffit
pas
pour
d√©truire
ou
suspendre
le
fort
des
mouvements
qui
est
dans
le
coeur
comme
dans
la
pi√®ce
ouvri√®re
de

le

est
diminu√©
ayant

de

emport√©s
comme
par
un
nouveau
courant
que
la
force
du

en

de
la
r√©sistance
trouve
√†
des

lorsque
le
nerf
optique
seul
comprim√©
ne

de

lorsque
les

de

interdites
ne

celle

ainsi
encore
que
entend
sans

entend
si

du

et
que
qui

dont
les

sont
libres
dans

dit
machinalement
tous

r√™ves
qui

passent
par

qui
ne

√†
quoi

sur

le

en

de

m√©decins
le
meilleur
celui
qui
m√©rite
le
plus
de
confiance
toujours
√†
mon
avis
celui
qui
est
le
plus
vers√©
dans
la
physique
ou
la
m√©canique
du
corps
humain
et
qui
laissant
et
toutes
les
inqui√©tudes
que
cette
chim√®re
donne
aux
sots
et
aux
ignorans
occup√©
s√©rieusement
que
du
pur
naturalisme
laissons
donc
le
pr√©tendu
charp
se
moquer
des
philosophes
qui
ont
regard√©
les
animaux
comme
des
machines
que
je
pense
diff√©remment
je
crois
que
descartes
serait
un
homme
respectable
√†
tous
√©gards
si
n√©
dans
un
si√®cle
pas
d√ª
√©clairer
il
e√ªt
connu
le
prix
de
et
de
et
le
danger
de
√©carter
mais
il
pas
moins
juste
que
je
fasse
ici
une
authentique
r√©paration
√†
ce
grand
homme
pour
tous
ces
petits
philosophes
mauvais
plaisants
et
mauvais
singes
de
locke
qui
au
lieu
de
rire
impudemment
au
nez
de
descartes
feraient
mieux
de
sentir
que
sans
lui
le
champ
de
la
philosophie
comme
celui
du
bon
esprit
sans
newton
serait
peut
√™tre
encore
en
friche
il
est
vrai
que
ce
c√©l√®bre
philosophe
beaucoup
tromp√©
et
personne
disconvient
mais
enfin
il
a
connu
la
nature
animale
il
a
le
premier
parfaitement
d√©montr√©
que
les
animaux
√©taient
de
pures
machines
or
apr√®s
une
d√©couverte
de
cette
importance
et
qui
suppose
autant
de
sagacit√©
le
moyen
sans
ingratitude
de
ne
pas
faire
gr√¢ce
√†
toutes
ses
erreurs
elles
sont
√†
mes
yeux
toutes
r√©par√©es
par
ce
grand
aveu
car
enfin
chante
sur
la
distinction
des
deux
substances
il
est
visible
que
ce
tour
une
ruse
de
style
pour
faire
avaler
aux
th√©ologiens
un
poison
cach√©
√†
analogie
qui
frappe
tout
le
monde
et
seuls
ne
voient
pas
car
elle
cette
forte
analogie
qui
force
tous
les
savants
et
les
vrais
juges
que
ces
√™tres
fiers
et
vains
plus
distingu√©s
par
leur
orgueil
que
par
le
nom
quelque
envie
aient
de
ne
sont
au
fond
que
des
animaux
et
des
machines
perpendiculairement
rampantes
elles
ont
toutes
ce
merveilleux
instinct
dont
fait
de
et
qui
a
toujours
son
si√®ge
dans
le
cerveau
et
√†
son
d√©faut
comme
manque
ou
est
ossifi√©
dans
la
mo√´lle
allong√©e
et
jamais
dans
le
cervelet
car
je
vu
consid√©rablement
bless√©
trouv√©
squirreux
sans
que
cess√¢t
de
faire
ses
fonctions
etre
machine
sentir
penser
savoir
distinguer
le
bien
du
mal
comme
le
bleu
du
jaune
en
un
mot
√™tre
n√©
avec
de
et
un
instinct
s√ªr
de
morale
et
animal
sont
donc
des
choses
qui
ne
sont
pas
plus
contradictoires
un
singe
ou
un
perroquet
et
savoir
se
donner
du
plaisir
car
puisque
se
pr√©sente
de
le
dire
qui
eut
jamais
devin√©
√†
priori
goutte
de
la
liqueur
qui
se
lance
dans
fit
ressentir
des
plaisirs
divins
et
en
na√Ætrait
une
petite
cr√©ature
qui
pourrait
un
jour
pos√©es
certaines
lois
jouir
des
m√™mes
d√©lices
je
crois
la
pens√©e
si
peu
incompatible
avec
la
mati√®re
organis√©e
semble
en
√™tre
une
propri√©t√©
telle
que
la

voulez

de
nouvelles
observations
en
voici
qui
sont
sans
r√©plique
et
qui
prouvent
toutes
que
ressemble
parfaitement
aux
animaux
dans
son
origine
comme
dans
tout
ce
que
nous
avons
d√©j√†
cru
essentiel
de
comparer
appelle
√†
la
bonne
foi
de
nos
observateurs
nous
disent
pas
vrai
que
dans
son
principe
ver
qui
devient
homme
comme
la
chenille
papillon
les
plus
graves
auteurs
nous
ont
appris
comment
il
faut
prendre
pour
voir
cet
animalcule
tous
les
curieux
vu
comme
hartsoeker
dans
la
semence
de
et
non
dans
celle
de
la
femme
il
a
que
les
sots
qui
soient
fait
scrupule
comme
chaque
goutte
de
sperme
contient
une
infinit√©
de
ces
petits
vers
sont
lanc√©s
√†
il
a
que
le
plus
adroit
ou
le
plus
vigoureux
qui
ait
la
force
de
et
de
dans
que
fournit
la
femme
et
qui
lui
donne
sa
premi√®re
nourriture
cet
oeuf
quelquefois
surpris
dans
les
trompes
de
fallope
est
port√©
par
ces
canaux
√†
la
matrice
o√π
il
prend
racine
comme
un
grain
de
bl√©
dans
la
terre
mais
y
devienne
monstrueux
par
sa
croissance
de
mois
il
ne
diff√®re
point
des
oeufs
des
autres
femelles
si
ce
que
sa
peau
ne
se
durcit
jamais
et
se
dilate
prodigieusement
comme
on
en
peut
juger
en
comparant
les
foetus
trouv√©s
en
situation
et
pr√®s
ce
que
eu
le
plaisir
dans
une
femme
morte
un
moment
avant
avec
petits
embryons
tr√®s
proches
de
leur
origine
car
alors
toujours
dans
sa
coque
et
dans
qui
g√™n√©
dans
ses
mouvements
cherche
machinalement
√†
voir
le
jour
et
pour
y
r√©ussir
il
commence
par
rompre
avec
la
t√™te
cette
membrane
il
sort
comme
le
poulet
de
la
leur
une
observation
que
je
ne
trouve
nulle
part
que
est
pas
plus
mince
pour
prodigieusement
√©tendu
semblable
en
cela
√†
la
matrice
dont
la
substance
m√™me
se
gonfle
de
sucs
infiltr√©s
ind√©pendamment
de
la
r√©pl√©tion
et
du
d√©ploiement
de
tous
ses
coudes
vasculeux
voyons
dans
et
hors
de
sa
coque
examinons
avec
un
microscope
les
plus
jeunes
embryons
de
de
de
ou
de
jours
apr√®s
ce
temps
les
yeux
suffisent
que
la
t√™te
seule
un
petit
oeuf
rond
avec
deux
points
noirs
qui
marquent
les
yeux
avant
ce
temps
tout
√©tant
plus
informe
on
pulpe
m√©dullaire
qui
est
le
cerveau
dans
lequel
se
forme
des
nerfs
ou
le
principe
du
sentiment
et
le
coeur
qui
a
d√©j√†
par
dans
cette
pulpe
la
facult√©
de
battre
le
punctum
saliens
de
malpighi
qui
doit
d√©j√†
une
partie
de
sa
vivacit√©
√†
des
nerfs
ensuite
on
voit
la
t√™te
allonger
le
col
qui
en
se
dilatant
forme
le
thorax
o√π
le
coeur
a
d√©j√†
descendu
pour

la

le

du

une

frappante
ici

des

couvrent
le

de
nos

des

le
m√™me
luxe
de
la

et
enfin
recteur
des

est
plac√©
o√π
nous
avons
notre
√¢me
cette

quintessence
de

est
de

√†
sentir
et
du
r√®gne
animal
et
v√©g√©tal
de
√†
la

m√™me
y
des

qui
en
v√©g√©tant
ou
se
battent
comme

fonctions
propres

voil√†
√†
peu
pr√®s
tout
ce
sait
de
la
g√©n√©ration
que
les
parties
qui
qui
sont
faites
pour
ensemble
et
pour
occuper
telle

place
se
r√©unissent
toutes
suivant
leur

forment
les

le

et
enfin
tout

corps
comme
de
grands
hommes
√©crit
cela
est
possible
mais
comme
nous
abandonne
au
milieu
des
ces
subtilit√©s
je
ne
supposerai
rien
regardant
tout
ce
qui
ne
frappe
pas
mes
sens
comme
un
myst√®re
imp√©n√©trable
il
est
si
rare
que
les
deux
semences
se
rencontrent
dans
le

que
je
serais
tent√©
de
croire
que
la
semence
de

est
inutile
√†
la
g√©n√©ration

comment
en
expliquer
les
ph√©nom√®nes
sans
ce
commode
rapport
de
parties
qui
rend
si
bien
raison
des
ressemblances
des
enfants

tant√¥t
√†
la

me
parait
que
le
m√¢le
qui
fait
tout
dans
une
femme
qui
dort
comme
dans

plus
lubrique
des
parties
serait
donc
fait
de
toute
√©ternit√©
dans
le
germe

tout
ceci
est
fort
de

des

ne

de

ne

point
que
toute

p√©rit

forme
apr√®s

car
nous

assurer

man
a
machine
it
is
not
enough
for
a
wise
man
to
study
nature
and
truth
he
should
dare
state
truth
for
the
benefit
of
the
few
who
are
willing
and
able
to
think
as
for
the
rest
who
are
voluntarily
slaves
of
prejudice
they
can
no
more
attain
truth
than
frogs
can
fly
i
reduce
to
two
the
systems
of
philosophy
which
deal
with
soul
the
first
and
older
system
is
materialism
the
second
is
spiritualism
the
metaphysicians
who
have
hinted
that
matter
may
well
be
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
thought
have
perhaps
not
reasoned
for
there
is
in
this
case
a
certain
advantage
in
their
inadequate
way
of
expressing
their
meaning
in
truth
to
ask
whether
matter
can
think
without
considering
it
otherwise
than
in
itself
is
like
asking
whether
matter
can
tell
time
it
may
be
foreseen
that
we
shall
avoid
this
reef
upon
which
locke
had
the
bad
luck
to
make
shipwreck
the
leibnizians
with
their
monads
have
set
up
an
unintelligible
hypothesis
they
have
rather
spiritualized
matter
than
materialized
the
soul
how
can
we
define
a
being
whose
nature
is
absolutely
unknown
to
us
descartes
and
all
the
cartesians
among
whom
the
followers
of
malebranche
have
long
been
numbered
have
made
the
same
mistake
they
have
taken
for
granted
two
distinct
substances
in
man
as
if
they
had
seen
them
and
positively
counted
them
the
wisest
men
have
declared
that
the
soul
can
not
know
itself
save
by
the
light
of
faith
however
as
reasonable
beings
they
have
thought
that
they
could
reserve
for
themselves
the
right
of
examining
what
the
bible
means
by
the
word
spirit
which
it
uses
in
speaking
of
the
human
soul
and
if
in
their
investigation
they
do
not
agree
with
the
theologians
on
this
point
are
the
theologians
more
in
agreement
among
themselves
on
all
other
points
here
is
the
result
in
a
few
words
of
all
their
reflections
if
there
is
a
god
he
is
the
author
of
nature
as
well
as
of
revelation
he
has
given
us
the
one
to
explain
the
other
and
reason
to
make
them
agree
to
distrust
the
knowledge
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
study
of
animated
bodies
is
to
regard
nature
and
revelation
as
two
contraries
which
destroy
each
the
other
and
consequently
to
dare
uphold
the
absurd
doctrine
that
god
contradicts
himself
in
his
various
works
and
deceives
us
if
there
is
a
revelation
it
can
not
then
contradict
nature
by
nature
only
can
we
understand
the
meaning
of
the
words
of
the
gospel
of
which
experience
is
the
only
true
interpreter
in
fact
the
commentators
before
our
time
have
only
obscured
the
truth
we
can
judge
of
this
by
the
author
of
the
spectacle
of
nature
it
is
astonishing
he
says
concerning
locke
that
a
man
who
degrades
our
soul
far
enough
to
consider
it
a
soul
of
clay
should
dare
set
up
reason
as
judge
and
sovereign
arbiter
of
the
mysteries
of
faith
for
he
adds
what
an
astonishing
idea
of
christianity
one
would
have
if
one
were
to
follow
reason
not
only
do
these
reflections
fail
to
elucidate
faith
but
they
also
constitute
such
frivolous
objections
to
the
method
of
those
who
undertake
to
interpret
the
scripture
that
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
waste
time
in
refuting
them
the
excellence
of
reason
does
not
depend
on
a
big
word
devoid
of
meaning
immateriality
but
on
the
force
extent
and
perspicuity
of
reason
itself
thus
a
soul
of
clay
which
should
discover
at
one
glance
as
it
were
the
relations
and
the
consequences
of
an
infinite
number
of
ideas
hard
to
understand
would
evidently
be
preferable
to
a
foolish
and
stupid
soul
though
that
were
composed
of
the
most
precious
elements
a
man
is
not
a
philosopher
because
with
pliny
he
blushes
over
the
wretchedness
of
our
origin
what
seems
vile
is
here
the
most
precious
of
things
and
seems
to
be
the
object
of
nature
highest
art
and
most
elaborate
care
but
as
man
even
though
he
should
come
from
an
apparently
still
more
lowly
source
would
yet
be
the
most
perfect
of
all
beings
so
whatever
the
origin
of
his
soul
if
it
is
pure
noble
and
lofty
it
is
a
beautiful
soul
which
dignifies
the
man
endowed
with
it
pluche
second
way
of
reasoning
seems
vicious
to
me
even
in
his
system
which
smacks
a
little
of
fanaticism
for
on
his
view
if
we
have
an
idea
of
faith
as
being
contrary
to
the
clearest
principles
to
the
most
incontestable
truths
we
must
yet
conclude
out
of
respect
for
revelation
and
its
author
that
this
conception
is
false
and
that
we
do
not
yet
understand
the
meaning
of
the
words
of
the
gospel
of
the
two
alternatives
only
one
is
possible
either
everything
is
illusion
nature
as
well
as
revelation
or
experience
alone
can
explain
faith
but
what
can
be
more
ridiculous
than
the
position
of
our
author
can
one
imagine
hearing
a
peripatetic
say
we
ought
not
to
accept
the
experiments
of
torricelli
for
if
we
should
accept
them
if
we
should
rid
ourselves
of
the
horror
of
the
void
what
an
astonishing
philosophy
we
should
have
i
have
shown
how
vicious
the
reasoning
of
pluche
is
in
order
to
prove
in
the
first
place
that
if
there
is
a
revelation
it
is
not
sufficiently
demonstrated
by
the
mere
authority
of
the
church
and
without
any
appeal
to
reason
as
all
those
who
fear
reason
claim
and
in
the
second
place
to
protect
against
all
assault
the
method
of
those
who
would
wish
to
follow
the
path
that
i
open
to
them
of
interpreting
supernatural
things
incomprehensible
in
themselves
in
the
light
of
those
ideas
with
which
nature
has
endowed
us
experience
and
observation
should
therefore
be
our
only
guides
here
both
are
to
be
found
throughout
the
records
of
the
physicians
who
were
philosophers
and
not
in
the
works
of
the
philosophers
who
were
not
physicians
the
former
have
traveled
through
and
illuminated
the
labyrinth
of
man
they
alone
have
laid
bare
to
us
those
springs
of
life
hidden
under
the
external
integument
which
conceals
so
many
wonders
from
our
eyes
they
alone
tranquilly
contemplating
our
soul
have
surprised
it
a
thousand
times
both
in
its
wretchedness
and
in
its
glory
and
they
have
no
more
despised
it
in
the
first
estate
than
they
have
admired
it
in
the
second
thus
to
repeat
only
the
physicians
have
a
right
to
speak
on
this
subject
what
could
the
others
especially
the
theologians
have
to
say
is
it
not
ridiculous
to
hear
them
shamelessly
coming
to
conclusions
about
a
subject
concerning
which
they
have
had
no
means
of
knowing
anything
and
from
which
on
the
contrary
they
have
been
completely
turned
aside
by
obscure
studies
that
have
led
them
to
a
thousand
prejudiced
opinions
in
a
word
to
fanaticism
which
adds
yet
more
to
their
ignorance
of
the
mechanism
of
the
body
but
even
though
we
have
chosen
the
best
guides
we
shall
still
find
many
thorns
and
stumbling
blocks
in
the
way
man
is
so
complicated
a
machine
that
it
is
impossible
to
get
a
clear
idea
of
the
machine
beforehand
and
hence
impossible
to
define
it
for
this
reason
all
the
investigations
have
been
vain
which
the
greatest
philosophers
have
made
√†
priori
that
is
to
say
in
so
far
as
they
use
as
it
were
the
wings
of
the
spirit
thus
it
is
only
√†
posteriori
or
by
trying
to
disentangle
the
soul
from
the
organs
of
the
body
so
to
speak
that
one
can
reach
the
highest
probability
concerning
man
own
nature
even
though
one
can
not
discover
with
certainty
what
his
nature
is
let
us
then
take
in
our
hands
the
staff
of
experience
paying
no
heed
to
the
accounts
of
all
the
idle
theories
of
philosophers
to
be
blind
and
to
think
that
one
can
do
without
this
staff
is
the
worst
kind
of
blindness
how
truly
a
contemporary
writer
says
that
only
vanity
fails
to
gather
from
secondary
causes
the
same
lessons
as
from
primary
causes
one
can
and
one
even
ought
to
admire
all
these
fine
geniuses
in
their
most
useless
works
such
men
as
descartes
malebranche
leibniz
wolff
and
the
rest
but
what
profit
i
ask
has
any
one
gained
from
their
profound
meditations
and
from
all
their
works
let
us
start
out
then
to
discover
not
what
has
been
thought
but
what
must
be
thought
for
the
sake
of
repose
in
life
there
are
as
many
different
minds
different
characters
and
different
customs
as
there
are
different
temperaments
even
galen
knew
this
truth
which
descartes
carried
so
far
as
to
claim
that
medicine
alone
can
change
minds
and
morals
along
with
bodies
by
the
writer
of
de
this
teaching
is
incorrectly
attributed
to
hippocrates
it
is
true
that
melancholy
bile
phlegm
blood
according
to
the
nature
the
abundance
and
the
different
combination
of
these
humors
make
each
man
different
from
another
in
disease
the
soul
is
sometimes
hidden
showing
no
sign
of
life
sometimes
it
is
so
inflamed
by
fury
that
it
seems
to
be
doubled
sometimes
imbecility
vanishes
and
the
convalescence
of
an
idiot
produces
a
wise
man
sometimes
again
the
greatest
genius
becomes
imbecile
and
loses
the
sense
of
self
adieu
then
to
all
that
fine
knowledge
acquired
at
so
high
a
price
and
with
so
much
trouble
here
is
a
paralytic
who
asks
if
his
leg
is
in
bed
with
him
there
is
a
soldier
who
thinks
that
he
still
has
the
arm
which
has
been
cut
off
the
memory
of
his
old
sensations
and
of
the
place
to
which
they
were
referred
by
his
soul
is
the
cause
of
his
illusion
and
of
this
kind
of
delirium
the
mere
mention
of
the
member
which
he
has
lost
is
enough
to
recall
it
to
his
mind
and
to
make
him
feel
all
its
motions
and
this
causes
him
an
indefinable
and
inexpressible
kind
of
imaginary
suffering
this
man
cries
like
a
child
at
death
approach
while
this
other
jests
what
was
needed
to
change
the
bravery
of
caius
julius
seneca
or
petronius
into
cowardice
or
faintheartedness
merely
an
obstruction
in
the
spleen
in
the
liver
an
impediment
in
the
portal
vein
why
because
the
imagination
is
obstructed
along
with
the
viscera
and
this
gives
rise
to
all
the
singular
phenomena
of
hysteria
and
hypochondria
what
can
i
add
to
the
stories
already
told
of
those
who
imagine
themselves
transformed
into
cocks
or
vampires
or
of
those
who
think
that
the
dead
feed
upon
them
why
should
i
stop
to
speak
of
the
man
who
imagines
that
his
nose
or
some
other
member
is
of
glass
the
way
to
help
this
man
regain
his
faculties
and
his
own
nose
is
to
advise
him
to
sleep
on
hay
lest
he
break
the
fragile
organ
and
then
to
set
fire
to
the
hay
that
he
may
be
afraid
of
being
burned
a
fear
which
has
sometimes
cured
paralysis
but
i
must
touch
lightly
on
facts
which
everybody
knows
neither
shall
i
dwell
long
on
the
details
of
the
effects
of
sleep
here
a
tired
soldier
snores
in
a
trench
in
the
middle
of
the
thunder
of
hundreds
of
cannon
his
soul
hears
nothing
his
sleep
is
as
deep
as
apoplexy
a
bomb
is
on
the
point
of
crushing
him
he
will
feel
this
less
perhaps
than
he
feels
an
insect
which
is
under
his
foot
on
the
other
hand
this
man
who
is
devoured
by
jealousy
hatred
avarice
or
ambition
can
never
find
any
rest
the
most
peaceful
spot
the
freshest
and
most
calming
drinks
are
alike
useless
to
one
who
has
not
freed
his
heart
from
the
torment
of
passion
the
soul
and
the
body
fall
asleep
together
as
the
motion
of
the
blood
is
calmed
a
sweet
feeling
of
peace
and
quiet
spreads
through
the
whole
mechanism
the
soul
feels
itself
little
by
little
growing
heavy
as
the
eyelids
droop
and
loses
its
tenseness
as
the
fibres
of
the
brain
relax
thus
little
by
little
it
becomes
as
if
paralyzed
and
with
it
all
the
muscles
of
the
body
these
can
no
longer
sustain
the
weight
of
the
head
and
the
soul
can
no
longer
bear
the
burden
of
thought
it
is
in
sleep
as
if
it
were
not
is
the
circulation
too
quick
the
soul
can
not
sleep
is
the
soul
too
much
excited
the
blood
can
not
be
quieted
it
gallops
through
the
veins
with
an
audible
murmur
such
are
the
two
opposite
causes
of
insomnia
a
single
fright
in
the
midst
of
our
dreams
makes
the
heart
beat
at
double
speed
and
snatches
us
from
needed
and
delicious
repose
as
a
real
grief
or
an
urgent
need
would
do
lastly
as
the
mere
cessation
of
the
functions
of
the
soul
produces
sleep
there
are
even
when
we
are
awake
or
at
least
when
we
are
half
awake
kinds
of
very
frequent
short
naps
of
the
mind
vergers
dreams
which
show
that
the
soul
does
not
always
wait
for
the
body
to
sleep
for
if
the
soul
is
not
fast
asleep
it
surely
is
not
far
from
sleep
since
it
can
not
point
out
a
single
object
to
which
it
has
attended
among
the
uncounted
number
of
confused
ideas
which
so
to
speak
fill
the
atmosphere
of
our
brains
like
clouds
opium
is
too
closely
related
to
the
sleep
it
produces
to
be
left
out
of
consideration
here
this
drug
intoxicates
like
wine
coffee
each
in
its
own
measure
and
according
to
the
dose
it
makes
a
man
happy
in
a
state
which
would
seemingly
be
the
tomb
of
feeling
as
it
is
the
image
of
death
how
sweet
is
this
lethargy
the
soul
would
long
never
to
emerge
from
it
for
the
soul
has
been
a
prey
to
the
most
intense
sorrow
but
now
feels
only
the
joy
of
suffering
past
and
of
sweetest
peace
opium
even
alters
the
will
forcing
the
soul
which
wished
to
wake
and
to
enjoy
life
to
sleep
in
spite
of
itself
i
shall
omit
any
reference
to
the
effect
of
poisons
coffee
the
antidote
for
wine
by
scourging
the
imagination
cures
our
headaches
and
scatters
our
cares
without
laying
up
for
us
as
wine
does
other
headaches
for
the
morrow
but
let
us
contemplate
the
soul
in
its
other
needs
the
human
body
is
a
machine
which
winds
its
own
springs
it
is
the
living
image
of
perpetual
movement
nourishment
keeps
up
the
movements
which
fever
excites
without
food
the
soul
pines
away
goes
mad
and
dies
exhausted
the
soul
is
a
taper
whose
light
flares
up
the
moment
before
it
goes
out
but
nourish
the
body
pour
into
its
veins
juices
and
strong
liquors
and
then
the
soul
grows
strong
like
them
as
if
arming
itself
with
a
proud
courage
and
the
soldier
whom
water
would
have
made
flee
grows
bold
and
runs
joyously
to
death
to
the
sound
of
drums
thus
a
hot
drink
sets
into
stormy
movement
the
blood
which
a
cold
drink
would
have
calmed
what
power
there
is
in
a
meal
joy
revives
in
a
sad
heart
and
infects
the
souls
of
comrades
who
express
their
delight
in
the
friendly
songs
in
which
the
frenchman
excels
the
melancholy
man
alone
is
dejected
and
the
studious
man
is
equally
out
of
place
in
such
company
raw
meat
makes
animals
fierce
and
it
would
have
the
same
effect
on
man
this
is
so
true
that
the
english
who
eat
meat
red
and
bloody
and
not
as
well
done
as
ours
seem
to
share
more
or
less
in
the
savagery
due
to
this
kind
of
food
and
to
other
causes
which
can
be
rendered
ineffective
by
education
only
this
savagery
creates
in
the
soul
pride
hatred
scorn
of
other
nations
indocility
and
other
sentiments
which
degrade
the
character
just
as
heavy
food
makes
a
dull
and
heavy
mind
whose
usual
traits
are
laziness
and
indolence
pope
understood
well
the
full
power
of
greediness
when
he
said
catius
is
ever
moral
ever
grave
thinks
who
endures
a
knave
is
next
a
knave
save
just
at
dinner
then
prefers
no
doubt
a
rogue
with
to
a
saint
without
elsewhere
he
says
see
the
same
man
in
vigor
in
the
gout
alone
in
company
in
place
or
out
early
at
business
and
at
hazard
late
mad
at
a
fox
chase
wise
at
a
debate
drunk
at
a
borough
civil
at
a
ball
friendly
at
hackney
faithless
at
white
hall
in
switzerland
we
had
a
bailiff
by
the
name
of
steigner
de
wittighofen
when
he
fasted
he
was
a
most
upright
and
even
a
most
indulgent
judge
but
woe
to
the
unfortunate
man
whom
he
found
on
the
culprit
bench
after
he
had
had
a
large
dinner
he
was
capable
of
sending
the
innocent
like
the
guilty
to
the
gallows
we
think
we
are
and
in
fact
we
are
good
men
only
as
we
are
gay
or
brave
everything
depends
on
the
way
our
machine
is
running
one
is
sometimes
inclined
to
say
that
the
soul
is
situated
in
the
stomach
and
that
van
helmont
who
said
that
the
seat
of
the
soul
was
in
the
pylorus
made
only
the
mistake
of
taking
the
part
for
the
whole
to
what
excesses
cruel
hunger
can
bring
us
we
no
longer
regard
even
our
own
parents
and
children
we
tear
them
to
pieces
eagerly
and
make
horrible
banquets
of
them
and
in
the
fury
with
which
we
are
carried
away
the
weakest
is
always
the
prey
of
the
strongest
one
needs
only
eyes
to
see
the
necessary
influence
of
old
age
on
reason
the
soul
follows
the
progress
of
the
body
as
it
does
the
progress
of
education
in
the
weaker
sex
the
soul
accords
also
with
delicacy
of
temperament
and
from
this
delicacy
follow
tenderness
affection
quick
feelings
due
more
to
passion
than
to
reason
prejudices
and
superstitions
whose
strong
impress
can
hardly
be
effaced
man
on
the
other
hand
whose
brain
and
nerves
partake
of
the
firmness
of
all
solids
has
not
only
stronger
features
but
also
a
more
vigorous
mind
education
which
women
lack
strengthens
his
mind
still
more
thus
with
such
help
of
nature
and
art
why
should
not
a
man
be
more
grateful
more
generous
more
constant
in
friendship
stronger
in
adversity
but
to
follow
almost
exactly
the
thought
of
the
author
of
the
lettres
sur
la
physiognomie
the
sex
which
unites
the
charms
of
the
mind
and
of
the
body
with
almost
all
the
tenderest
and
most
delicate
feelings
of
the
heart
should
not
envy
us
the
two
capacities
which
seem
to
have
been
given
to
man
the
one
merely
to
enable
him
better
to
fathom
the
allurements
of
beauty
and
the
other
merely
to
enable
him
to
minister
better
to
its
pleasures
it
is
no
more
necessary
to
be
just
as
great
a
physiognomist
as
this
author
in
order
to
guess
the
quality
of
the
mind
from
the
countenance
or
the
shape
of
the
features
provided
these
are
sufficiently
marked
than
it
is
necessary
to
be
a
great
doctor
to
recognize
a
disease
accompanied
by
all
its
marked
symptoms
look
at
the
portraits
of
locke
of
steele
of
boerhaave
of
maupertuis
and
the
rest
and
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
find
strong
faces
and
eagle
eyes
look
over
a
multitude
of
others
and
you
can
always
distinguish
the
man
of
talent
from
the
man
of
genius
and
often
even
an
honest
man
from
a
scoundrel
for
example
it
has
been
noticed
that
a
celebrated
poet
combines
in
his
portrait
the
look
of
a
pickpocket
with
the
fire
of
prometheus
history
provides
us
with
a
noteworthy
example
of
the
power
of
temperature
the
famous
duke
of
guise
was
so
strongly
convinced
that
henry
the
third
in
whose
power
he
had
so
often
been
would
never
dare
assassinate
him
that
he
went
to
blois
when
the
chancelor
chiverny
learned
of
the
duke
departure
he
cried
he
is
lost
after
this
fatal
prediction
had
been
fulfilled
by
the
event
chiverny
was
asked
why
he
made
it
i
have
known
the
king
for
twenty
years
said
he
he
is
naturally
kind
and
even
weakly
indulgent
but
i
have
noticed
that
when
it
is
cold
it
takes
nothing
at
all
to
provoke
him
and
send
him
into
a
passion
one
nation
is
of
heavy
and
stupid
wit
and
another
quick
light
and
penetrating
whence
comes
this
difference
if
not
in
part
from
the
difference
in
foods
and
difference
in
inheritance
and
in
part
from
the
mixture
of
the
diverse
elements
which
float
around
in
the
immensity
of
the
void
the
mind
like
the
body
has
its
contagious
diseases
and
its
scurvy
such
is
the
influence
of
climate
that
a
man
who
goes
from
one
climate
to
another
feels
the
change
in
spite
of
himself
he
is
a
walking
plant
which
has
transplanted
itself
if
the
climate
is
not
the
same
it
will
surely
either
degenerate
or
improve
furthermore
we
catch
everything
from
those
with
whom
we
come
in
contact
their
gestures
their
accent
etc
just
as
the
eyelid
is
instinctively
lowered
when
a
blow
is
foreseen
or
as
for
the
same
reason
the
body
of
the
spectator
mechanically
imitates
in
spite
of
himself
all
the
motions
of
a
good
mimic
from
what
i
have
just
said
it
follows
that
a
brilliant
man
is
his
own
best
company
unless
he
can
find
other
company
of
the
same
sort
in
the
society
of
the
unintelligent
the
mind
grows
rusty
for
lack
of
exercise
as
at
tennis
a
ball
that
is
served
badly
is
badly
returned
i
should
prefer
an
intelligent
man
without
an
education
if
he
were
still
young
enough
to
a
man
badly
educated
a
badly
trained
mind
is
like
an
actor
whom
the
provinces
have
spoiled
thus
the
diverse
states
of
the
soul
are
always
correlative
with
those
of
the
body
but
the
better
to
show
this
dependence
in
its
completeness
and
its
causes
let
us
here
make
use
of
comparative
anatomy
let
us
lay
bare
the
organs
of
man
and
of
animals
how
can
human
nature
be
known
if
we
may
not
derive
any
light
from
an
exact
comparison
of
the
structure
of
man
and
of
animals
in
general
the
form
and
the
structure
of
the
brains
of
quadrupeds
are
almost
the
same
as
those
of
the
brain
of
man
the
same
shape
the
same
arrangement
everywhere
with
this
essential
difference
that
of
all
the
animals
man
is
the
one
whose
brain
is
largest
and
in
proportion
to
its
mass
more
convoluted
than
the
brain
of
any
other
animal
then
come
the
monkey
the
beaver
the
elephant
the
dog
the
fox
the
cat
these
animals
are
most
like
man
for
among
them
too
one
notes
the
same
progressive
analogy
in
relation
to
the
corpus
callosum
in
which
lancisi
anticipating
the
late
de
la
peyronie
established
the
seat
of
the
soul
the
latter
however
illustrated
the
theory
by
innumerable
experiments
next
after
all
the
quadrupeds
birds
have
the
largest
brains
fish
have
large
heads
but
these
are
void
of
sense
like
the
heads
of
many
men
fish
have
no
corpus
callosum
and
very
little
brain
while
insects
entirely
lack
brain
i
shall
not
launch
out
into
any
more
detail
about
the
varieties
of
nature
nor
into
conjectures
concerning
them
for
there
is
an
infinite
number
of
both
as
any
one
can
see
by
reading
no
further
than
the
treatises
of
willis
de
cerebro
and
de
anima
brutorum
i
shall
draw
the
conclusions
which
follow
clearly
from
these
incontestable
observations
that
the
fiercer
animals
are
the
less
brain
they
have
that
this
organ
seems
to
increase
in
size
in
proportion
to
the
gentleness
of
the
animal
that
nature
seems
here
eternally
to
impose
a
singular
condition
that
the
more
one
gains
in
intelligence
the
more
one
loses
in
instinct
does
this
bring
gain
or
loss
do
not
think
however
that
i
wish
to
infer
by
that
that
the
size
alone
of
the
brain
is
enough
to
indicate
the
degree
of
tameness
in
animals
the
quality
must
correspond
to
the
quantity
and
the
solids
and
liquids
must
be
in
that
due
equilibrium
which
constitutes
health
if
as
is
ordinarily
observed
the
imbecile
does
not
lack
brain
his
brain
will
be
deficient
in
its
consistency
for
instance
in
being
too
soft
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
insane
and
the
defects
of
their
brains
do
not
always
escape
our
investigation
but
if
the
causes
of
imbecility
insanity
are
not
obvious
where
shall
we
look
for
the
causes
of
the
diversity
of
all
minds
they
would
escape
the
eyes
of
a
lynx
and
of
an
argus
a
mere
nothing
a
tiny
fibre
something
that
could
never
be
found
by
the
most
delicate
anatomy
would
have
made
of
erasmus
and
fontenelle
two
idiots
and
fontenelle
himself
speaks
of
this
very
fact
in
one
of
his
best
dialogues
willis
has
noticed
in
addition
to
the
softness
of
the
in
children
puppies
and
birds
that
the
corpora
striata
are
obliterated
and
discolored
in
all
these
animals
and
that
the
striations
are
as
imperfectly
formed
as
in
paralytics
however
cautious
and
reserved
one
may
be
about
the
consequences
that
can
be
deduced
from
these
observations
and
from
many
others
concerning
the
kind
of
variation
in
the
organs
nerves
one
must
admit
that
so
many
different
varieties
can
not
be
the
gratuitous
play
of
nature
they
prove
at
least
the
necessity
for
a
good
and
vigorous
physical
organization
since
throughout
the
animal
kingdom
the
soul
gains
force
with
the
body
and
acquires
keenness
as
the
body
gains
strength
let
us
pause
to
contemplate
the
varying
capacity
of
animals
to
learn
doubtless
the
analogy
best
framed
leads
the
mind
to
think
that
the
causes
we
have
mentioned
produce
all
the
difference
that
is
found
between
animals
and
men
although
we
must
confess
that
our
weak
understanding
limited
to
the
coarsest
observations
can
not
see
the
bonds
that
exist
between
cause
and
effects
this
is
a
kind
of
harmony
that
philosophers
will
never
know
among
animals
some
learn
to
speak
and
sing
they
remember
tunes
and
strike
the
notes
as
exactly
as
a
musician
others
for
instance
the
ape
show
more
intelligence
and
yet
can
not
learn
music
what
is
the
reason
for
this
except
some
defect
in
the
organs
of
speech
but
is
this
defect
so
essential
to
the
structure
that
it
could
never
be
remedied
in
a
word
would
it
be
absolutely
impossible
to
teach
the
ape
a
language
i
do
not
think
so
i
should
choose
a
large
ape
in
preference
to
any
other
until
by
some
good
fortune
another
kind
should
be
discovered
more
like
us
for
nothing
prevents
there
being
such
an
one
in
regions
unknown
to
us
the
ape
resembles
us
so
strongly
that
naturalists
have
called
it
wild
man
or
man
of
the
woods
i
should
take
it
in
the
condition
of
the
pupils
of
amman
that
is
to
say
i
should
not
want
it
to
be
too
young
or
too
old
for
apes
that
are
brought
to
europe
are
usually
too
old
i
would
choose
the
one
with
the
most
intelligent
face
and
the
one
which
in
a
thousand
little
ways
best
lived
up
to
its
look
of
intelligence
finally
not
considering
myself
worthy
to
be
his
master
i
should
put
him
in
the
school
of
that
excellent
teacher
whom
i
have
just
named
or
with
another
teacher
equally
skilful
if
there
is
one
you
know
by
amman
work
and
by
all
those
who
have
interpreted
his
method
all
the
wonders
he
has
been
able
to
accomplish
for
those
born
deaf
in
their
eyes
he
discovered
ears
as
he
himself
explains
and
in
how
short
a
time
in
short
he
taught
them
to
hear
speak
read
and
write
i
grant
that
a
deaf
person
eyes
see
more
clearly
and
are
keener
than
if
he
were
not
deaf
for
the
loss
of
one
member
or
sense
can
increase
the
strength
or
acuteness
of
another
but
apes
see
and
hear
they
understand
what
they
hear
and
see
and
grasp
so
perfectly
the
signs
that
are
made
to
them
that
i
doubt
not
that
they
would
surpass
the
pupils
of
amman
in
any
other
game
or
exercise
why
then
should
the
education
of
monkeys
be
impossible
why
might
not
the
monkey
by
dint
of
great
pains
at
last
imitate
after
the
manner
of
deaf
mutes
the
motions
necessary
for
pronunciation
i
do
not
dare
decide
whether
the
monkey
organs
of
speech
however
trained
would
be
incapable
of
articulation
but
because
of
the
great
analogy
between
ape
and
man
and
because
there
is
no
known
animal
whose
external
and
internal
organs
so
strikingly
resemble
man
it
would
surprise
me
if
speech
were
absolutely
impossible
to
the
ape
locke
who
was
certainly
never
suspected
of
credulity
found
no
difficulty
in
believing
the
story
told
by
sir
william
temple
in
his
memoirs
about
a
parrot
which
could
answer
rationally
and
which
had
learned
to
carry
on
a
kind
of
connected
conversation
as
we
do
i
know
that
people
have
ridiculed
this
great
metaphysician
but
suppose
some
one
should
have
announced
that
reproduction
sometimes
takes
place
without
eggs
or
a
female
would
he
have
found
many
partisans
yet
trembley
has
found
cases
where
reproduction
takes
place
without
copulation
and
by
fission
would
not
amman
too
have
passed
for
mad
if
he
had
boasted
that
he
could
instruct
scholars
like
his
in
so
short
a
time
before
he
had
happily
accomplished
the
feat
his
successes
have
however
astonished
the
world
and
he
like
the
author
of
the
history
of
polyps
has
risen
to
immortality
at
one
bound
whoever
owes
the
miracles
that
he
works
to
his
own
genius
surpasses
in
my
opinion
the
man
who
owes
his
to
chance
he
who
has
discovered
the
art
of
adorning
the
most
beautiful
of
the
kingdoms
of
nature
and
of
giving
it
perfections
that
it
did
not
have
should
be
rated
above
an
idle
creator
of
frivolous
systems
or
a
painstaking
author
of
sterile
discoveries
amman
discoveries
are
certainly
of
a
much
greater
value
he
has
freed
men
from
the
instinct
to
which
they
seemed
to
be
condemned
and
has
given
them
ideas
intelligence
or
in
a
word
a
soul
which
they
would
never
have
had
what
greater
power
than
this
let
us
not
limit
the
resources
of
nature
they
are
infinite
especially
when
reinforced
by
great
art
could
not
the
device
which
opens
the
eustachian
canal
of
the
deaf
open
that
of
apes
might
not
a
happy
desire
to
imitate
the
pronunciation
liberate
the
organs
of
speech
in
animals
that
imitate
so
many
other
signs
with
such
skill
and
intelligence
not
only
do
i
defy
any
one
to
name
any
really
conclusive
experiment
which
proves
my
view
impossible
and
absurd
but
such
is
the
likeness
of
the
structure
and
functions
of
the
ape
to
ours
that
i
have
very
little
doubt
that
if
this
animal
were
properly
trained
he
might
at
last
be
taught
to
pronounce
and
consequently
to
know
a
language
then
he
would
no
longer
be
a
wild
man
nor
a
defective
man
but
he
would
be
a
perfect
man
a
little
gentleman
with
as
much
matter
or
muscle
as
we
have
for
thinking
and
profiting
by
his
education
the
transition
from
animals
to
man
is
not
violent
as
true
philosophers
will
admit
what
was
man
before
the
invention
of
words
and
the
knowledge
of
language
an
animal
of
his
own
species
with
much
less
instinct
than
the
others
in
those
days
he
did
not
consider
himself
king
over
the
other
animals
nor
was
he
distinguished
from
the
ape
and
from
the
rest
except
as
the
ape
itself
differs
from
the
other
animals
by
a
more
intelligent
face
reduced
to
the
bare
intuitive
knowledge
of
the
leibnizians
he
saw
only
shapes
and
colors
without
being
able
to
distinguish
between
them
the
same
old
as
young
child
at
all
ages
he
lisped
out
his
sensations
and
his
needs
as
a
dog
that
is
hungry
or
tired
of
sleeping
asks
for
something
to
eat
or
for
a
walk
words
languages
laws
sciences
and
the
fine
arts
have
come
and
by
them
finally
the
rough
diamond
of
our
mind
has
been
polished
man
has
been
trained
in
the
same
way
as
animals
he
has
become
an
author
as
they
became
beasts
of
burden
a
geometrician
has
learned
to
perform
the
most
difficult
demonstrations
and
calculations
as
a
monkey
has
learned
to
take
his
little
hat
off
and
on
and
to
mount
his
tame
dog
all
has
been
accomplished
through
signs
every
species
has
learned
what
it
could
understand
and
in
this
way
men
have
acquired
symbolic
knowledge
still
so
called
by
our
german
philosophers
nothing
as
any
one
can
see
is
so
simple
as
the
mechanism
of
our
education
everything
may
be
reduced
to
sounds
or
words
that
pass
from
the
mouth
of
one
through
the
ears
of
another
into
his
brain
at
the
same
moment
he
perceives
through
his
eyes
the
shape
of
the
bodies
of
which
these
words
are
the
arbitrary
signs
but
who
was
the
first
to
speak
who
was
the
first
teacher
of
the
human
race
who
invented
the
means
of
utilizing
the
plasticity
of
our
organism
i
can
not
answer
the
names
of
these
first
splendid
geniuses
have
been
lost
in
the
night
of
time
but
art
is
the
child
of
nature
so
nature
must
have
long
preceded
it
we
must
think
that
the
men
who
were
the
most
highly
organized
those
on
whom
nature
had
lavished
her
richest
gifts
taught
the
others
they
could
not
have
heard
a
new
sound
for
instance
nor
experienced
new
sensations
nor
been
struck
by
all
the
varied
and
beautiful
objects
that
compose
the
ravishing
spectacle
of
nature
without
finding
themselves
in
the
state
of
mind
of
the
deaf
man
of
chartres
whose
experience
was
first
related
by
the
great
fontenelle
when
at
forty
years
he
heard
for
the
first
time
the
astonishing
sound
of
bells
would
it
be
absurd
to
conclude
from
this
that
the
first
mortals
tried
after
the
manner
of
this
deaf
man
or
like
animals
and
like
mutes
another
kind
of
animals
to
express
their
new
feelings
by
motions
depending
on
the
nature
of
their
imagination
and
therefore
afterwards
by
spontaneous
sounds
distinctive
of
each
animal
as
the
natural
expression
of
their
surprise
their
joy
their
ecstasies
and
their
needs
for
doubtless
those
whom
nature
endowed
with
finer
feeling
had
also
greater
facility
in
expression
that
is
the
way
in
which
i
think
men
have
used
their
feeling
and
their
instinct
to
gain
intelligence
and
then
have
employed
their
intelligence
to
gain
knowledge
those
are
the
ways
so
far
as
i
can
understand
them
in
which
men
have
filled
the
brain
with
the
ideas
for
the
reception
of
which
nature
made
it
nature
and
man
have
helped
each
other
and
the
smallest
beginnings
have
little
by
little
increased
until
everything
in
the
universe
could
be
as
easily
described
as
a
circle
as
a
violin
string
or
a
harpsichord
key
vibrates
and
gives
forth
sound
so
the
cerebral
fibres
struck
by
waves
of
sound
are
stimulated
to
render
or
repeat
the
words
that
strike
them
and
as
the
structure
of
the
brain
is
such
that
when
eyes
well
formed
for
seeing
have
once
perceived
the
image
of
objects
the
brain
can
not
help
seeing
their
images
and
their
differences
so
when
the
signs
of
these
differences
have
been
traced
or
imprinted
in
the
brain
the
soul
necessarily
examines
their
relations
an
examination
that
would
have
been
impossible
without
the
discovery
of
signs
or
the
invention
of
language
at
the
time
when
the
universe
was
almost
dumb
the
attitude
toward
all
objects
was
that
of
a
man
without
any
idea
of
proportion
toward
a
picture
or
a
piece
of
sculpture
in
which
he
could
distinguish
nothing
or
the
soul
was
like
a
little
child
for
the
soul
was
then
in
its
infancy
who
holding
in
his
hand
small
bits
of
straw
or
wood
sees
them
in
a
vague
and
superficial
way
without
being
able
to
count
or
distinguish
them
but
let
some
one
attach
a
kind
of
banner
or
standard
to
this
bit
of
wood
which
perhaps
is
called
a
mast
and
another
banner
to
another
similar
object
let
the
first
be
known
by
the
symbol
and
the
second
by
the
symbol
or
number
then
the
child
will
be
able
to
count
the
objects
and
in
this
way
he
will
learn
all
of
arithmetic
as
soon
as
one
figure
seems
equal
to
another
in
its
numerical
sign
he
will
decide
without
difficulty
that
they
are
two
different
bodies
that
make
and
make
etc
this
real
or
apparent
likeness
of
figures
is
the
fundamental
basis
of
all
truths
and
of
all
we
know
among
these
sciences
evidently
those
whose
signs
are
less
simple
and
less
sensible
are
harder
to
understand
than
the
others
because
more
talent
is
required
to
comprehend
and
combine
the
immense
number
of
words
by
which
such
sciences
express
the
truths
in
their
province
on
the
other
hand
the
sciences
that
are
expressed
by
numbers
or
by
other
small
signs
are
easily
learned
and
without
doubt
this
facility
rather
than
its
demonstrability
is
what
has
made
the
fortune
of
algebra
all
this
knowledge
with
which
vanity
fills
the
brains
of
our
proud
pedants
is
therefore
but
a
huge
mass
of
words
and
figures
which
form
in
the
brain
all
the
marks
by
which
we
distinguish
and
recall
objects
all
our
ideas
are
awakened
after
the
fashion
in
which
the
gardener
who
knows
plants
recalls
all
stages
of
their
growth
at
sight
of
them
these
words
and
the
objects
designated
by
them
are
so
connected
in
the
brain
that
it
is
comparatively
rare
to
imagine
a
thing
without
the
name
or
sign
that
is
attached
to
it
i
always
use
the
word
imagine
because
i
think
that
everything
is
the
work
of
imagination
and
that
all
the
faculties
of
the
soul
can
be
correctly
reduced
to
pure
imagination
in
which
they
all
consist
thus
judgment
reason
and
memory
are
not
absolute
parts
of
the
soul
but
merely
modifications
of
this
kind
of
medullary
screen
upon
which
images
of
the
objects
painted
in
the
eye
are
projected
as
by
a
magic
lantern
but
if
such
is
the
marvelous
and
incomprehensible
result
of
the
structure
of
the
brain
if
everything
is
perceived
and
explained
by
imagination
why
should
we
divide
the
sensitive
principle
which
thinks
in
man
is
not
this
a
clear
inconsistency
in
the
partisans
of
the
simplicity
of
the
mind
for
a
thing
that
is
divided
can
no
longer
without
absurdity
be
regarded
as
indivisible
see
to
what
one
is
brought
by
the
abuse
of
language
and
by
those
fine
words
spirituality
immateriality
etc
used
haphazard
and
not
understood
even
by
the
most
brilliant
nothing
is
easier
than
to
prove
a
system
based
as
this
one
is
on
the
intimate
feeling
and
personal
experience
of
each
individual
if
the
imagination
or
let
us
say
that
fantastic
part
of
the
brain
whose
nature
is
as
unknown
to
us
as
its
way
of
acting
be
naturally
small
or
weak
it
will
hardly
be
able
to
compare
the
analogy
or
the
resemblance
of
its
ideas
it
will
be
able
to
see
only
what
is
face
to
face
with
it
or
what
affects
it
very
strongly
and
how
will
it
see
all
this
yet
it
is
always
imagination
which
apperceives
and
imagination
which
represents
to
itself
all
objects
along
with
their
names
and
symbols
and
thus
once
again
imagination
is
the
soul
since
it
plays
all
the
r√¥les
of
the
soul
by
the
imagination
by
its
flattering
brush
the
cold
skeleton
of
reason
takes
on
living
and
ruddy
flesh
by
the
imagination
the
sciences
flourish
the
arts
are
adorned
the
wood
speaks
the
echoes
sigh
the
rocks
weep
marble
breathes
and
all
inanimate
objects
gain
life
it
is
imagination
again
which
adds
the
piquant
charm
of
voluptuousness
to
the
tenderness
of
an
amorous
heart
which
makes
tenderness
bud
in
the
study
of
the
philosopher
and
of
the
dusty
pedant
which
in
a
word
creates
scholars
as
well
as
orators
and
poets
foolishly
decried
by
some
vainly
praised
by
others
and
misunderstood
by
all
it
follows
not
only
in
the
train
of
the
graces
and
of
the
fine
arts
it
not
only
describes
but
can
also
measure
nature
it
reasons
judges
analyzes
compares
and
investigates
could
it
feel
so
keenly
the
beauties
of
the
pictures
drawn
for
it
unless
it
discovered
their
relations
no
just
as
it
can
not
turn
its
thoughts
on
the
pleasures
of
the
senses
without
enjoying
their
perfection
or
their
voluptuousness
it
can
not
reflect
on
what
it
has
mechanically
conceived
without
thus
being
judgment
itself
the
more
the
imagination
or
the
poorest
talent
is
exercised
the
more
it
gains
in
embonpoint
so
to
speak
and
the
larger
it
grows
it
becomes
sensitive
robust
broad
and
capable
of
thinking
the
best
of
organisms
has
need
of
this
exercise
man
preeminent
advantage
is
his
organism
in
vain
all
writers
of
books
on
morals
fail
to
regard
as
praiseworthy
those
qualities
that
come
by
nature
esteeming
only
the
talents
gained
by
dint
of
reflection
and
industry
for
whence
come
i
ask
skill
learning
and
virtue
if
not
from
a
disposition
that
makes
us
fit
to
become
skilful
wise
and
virtuous
and
whence
again
comes
this
disposition
if
not
from
nature
only
through
nature
do
we
have
any
good
qualities
to
her
we
owe
all
that
we
are
why
then
should
i
not
esteem
men
with
good
natural
qualities
as
much
as
men
who
shine
by
acquired
and
as
it
were
borrowed
virtues
whatever
the
virtue
may
be
from
whatever
source
it
may
come
it
is
worthy
of
esteem
the
only
question
is
how
to
estimate
it
mind
beauty
wealth
nobility
although
the
children
of
chance
all
have
their
own
value
as
skill
learning
and
virtue
have
theirs
those
upon
whom
nature
has
heaped
her
most
costly
gifts
should
pity
those
to
whom
these
gifts
have
been
refused
but
in
their
character
of
experts
they
may
feel
their
superiority
without
pride
a
beautiful
woman
would
be
as
foolish
to
think
herself
ugly
as
an
intelligent
man
to
think
himself
a
fool
an
exaggerated
modesty
a
rare
fault
to
be
sure
is
a
kind
of
ingratitude
towards
nature
an
honest
pride
on
the
contrary
is
the
mark
of
a
strong
and
beautiful
soul
revealed
by
manly
features
moulded
by
feeling
if
one
organism
is
an
advantage
and
the
preeminent
advantage
and
the
source
of
all
others
education
is
the
second
the
best
made
brain
would
be
a
total
loss
without
it
just
as
the
best
constituted
man
would
be
but
a
common
peasant
without
knowledge
of
the
ways
of
the
world
but
on
the
other
hand
what
would
be
the
use
of
the
most
excellent
school
without
a
matrix
perfectly
open
to
the
entrance
and
conception
of
ideas
it
is
impossible
to
impart
a
single
idea
to
a
man
deprived
of
all
his
senses
but
if
the
brain
is
at
the
same
time
well
organized
and
well
educated
it
is
a
fertile
soil
well
sown
that
brings
forth
a
hundredfold
what
it
has
received
or
to
leave
the
figures
of
speech
often
needed
to
express
what
one
means
and
to
add
grace
to
truth
itself
the
imagination
raised
by
art
to
the
rare
and
beautiful
dignity
of
genius
apprehends
exactly
all
the
relations
of
the
ideas
it
has
conceived
and
takes
in
easily
an
astounding
number
of
objects
in
order
to
deduce
from
them
a
long
chain
of
consequences
which
are
again
but
new
relations
produced
by
a
comparison
with
the
first
to
which
the
soul
finds
a
perfect
resemblance
such
is
i
think
the
generation
of
intelligence
i
say
finds
as
i
before
gave
the
epithet
apparent
to
the
likeness
of
objects
not
because
i
think
that
our
senses
are
always
deceivers
as
father
malebranche
has
claimed
or
that
our
eyes
naturally
a
little
unsteady
fail
to
see
objects
as
they
are
in
themselves
though
microscopes
prove
this
to
us
every
day
but
in
order
to
avoid
any
dispute
with
the
pyrrhonians
among
whom
bayle
is
well
known
i
say
of
truth
in
general
what
de
fontenelle
says
of
certain
truths
in
particular
that
we
must
sacrifice
it
in
order
to
remain
on
good
terms
with
society
and
it
accords
with
the
gentleness
of
my
character
to
avoid
all
disputes
unless
to
whet
conversation
the
cartesians
would
here
in
vain
make
an
onset
upon
me
with
their
innate
ideas
i
certainly
would
not
give
myself
a
quarter
of
the
trouble
that
locke
took
to
attack
such
chimeras
in
truth
what
is
the
use
of
writing
a
ponderous
volume
to
prove
a
doctrine
which
became
an
axiom
three
thousand
years
ago
according
to
the
principles
which
we
have
laid
down
and
which
we
consider
true
he
who
has
the
most
imagination
should
be
regarded
as
having
the
most
intelligence
or
genius
for
all
these
words
are
synonymous
and
again
only
by
a
shameful
abuse
of
terms
do
we
think
that
we
are
saying
different
things
when
we
are
merely
using
different
words
different
sounds
to
which
no
idea
or
real
distinction
is
attached
the
finest
greatest
or
strongest
imagination
is
then
the
one
most
suited
to
the
sciences
as
well
as
to
the
arts
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
whether
more
intellect
is
necessary
to
excel
in
the
art
of
aristotle
or
of
descartes
than
to
excel
in
that
of
euripides
or
of
sophocles
and
whether
nature
has
taken
more
trouble
to
make
newton
than
to
make
corneille
though
i
doubt
this
but
it
is
certain
that
imagination
alone
differently
applied
has
produced
their
diverse
triumphs
and
their
immortal
glory
if
one
is
known
as
having
little
judgment
and
much
imagination
this
means
that
the
imagination
has
been
left
too
much
alone
has
as
it
were
occupied
most
of
the
time
in
looking
at
itself
in
the
mirror
of
its
sensations
has
not
sufficiently
formed
the
habit
of
examining
the
sensations
themselves
attentively
it
means
that
the
imagination
has
been
more
impressed
by
images
than
by
their
truth
or
their
likeness
truly
so
quick
are
the
responses
of
the
imagination
that
if
attention
that
key
or
mother
of
the
sciences
does
not
do
its
part
imagination
can
do
little
more
than
run
over
and
skim
its
objects
see
that
bird
on
the
bough
it
seems
always
ready
to
fly
away
imagination
is
like
the
bird
always
carried
onward
by
the
turmoil
of
the
blood
and
the
animal
spirits
one
wave
leaves
a
mark
effaced
by
the
one
that
follows
the
soul
pursues
it
often
in
vain
it
must
expect
to
regret
the
loss
of
that
which
it
has
not
quickly
enough
seized
and
fixed
thus
imagination
the
true
image
of
time
is
being
ceaselessly
destroyed
and
renewed
such
is
the
chaos
and
the
continuous
quick
succession
of
our
ideas
they
drive
each
other
away
even
as
one
wave
yields
to
another
therefore
if
imagination
does
not
as
it
were
use
one
set
of
its
muscles
to
maintain
a
kind
of
equilibrium
with
the
fibres
of
the
brain
to
keep
its
attention
for
a
while
upon
an
object
that
is
on
the
point
of
disappearing
and
to
prevent
itself
from
contemplating
prematurely
another
object
unless
the
imagination
does
all
this
it
will
never
be
worthy
of
the
fine
name
of
judgment
it
will
express
vividly
what
it
has
perceived
in
the
same
fashion
it
will
create
orators
musicians
painters
poets
but
never
a
single
philosopher
on
the
contrary
if
the
imagination
be
trained
from
childhood
to
bridle
itself
and
to
keep
from
being
carried
away
by
its
own
impetuosity
an
impetuosity
which
creates
only
brilliant
enthusiasts
and
to
check
to
restrain
its
ideas
to
examine
them
in
all
their
aspects
in
order
to
see
all
sides
of
an
object
then
the
imagination
ready
in
judgment
will
comprehend
the
greatest
possible
sphere
of
objects
through
reasoning
and
its
vivacity
always
so
good
a
sign
in
children
and
only
needing
to
be
regulated
by
study
and
training
will
be
only
a
insight
without
which
little
progress
can
be
made
in
the
sciences
such
are
the
simple
foundations
upon
which
the
edifice
of
logic
has
been
reared
nature
has
built
these
foundations
for
the
whole
human
race
but
some
have
used
them
while
others
have
abused
them
in
spite
of
all
these
advantages
of
man
over
animals
it
is
doing
him
honor
to
place
him
in
the
same
class
for
truly
up
to
a
certain
age
he
is
more
of
an
animal
than
they
since
at
birth
he
has
less
instinct
what
animal
would
die
of
hunger
in
the
midst
of
a
river
of
milk
man
alone
like
that
child
of
olden
time
to
whom
a
modern
writer
refers
following
arnobius
he
knows
neither
the
foods
suitable
for
him
nor
the
water
that
can
drown
him
nor
the
fire
that
can
reduce
him
to
ashes
light
a
wax
candle
for
the
first
time
under
a
child
eyes
and
he
will
mechanically
put
his
fingers
in
the
flame
as
if
to
find
out
what
is
the
new
thing
that
he
sees
it
is
at
his
own
cost
that
he
will
learn
of
the
danger
but
he
will
not
be
caught
again
or
put
the
child
with
an
animal
on
a
precipice
the
child
alone
falls
off
he
drowns
where
the
animal
would
save
itself
by
swimming
at
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
the
child
knows
hardly
anything
of
the
great
pleasures
in
store
for
him
in
the
reproduction
of
his
species
when
he
is
a
youth
he
does
not
know
exactly
how
to
behave
in
a
game
which
nature
teaches
animals
so
quickly
he
hides
himself
as
if
he
were
ashamed
of
taking
pleasure
and
of
having
been
made
to
be
happy
while
animals
frankly
glory
in
being
cynics
without
education
they
are
without
prejudices
for
one
more
example
let
us
observe
a
dog
and
a
child
who
have
lost
their
master
on
a
highway
the
child
cries
and
does
not
know
to
what
saint
to
pray
while
the
dog
better
helped
by
his
sense
of
smell
than
the
child
by
his
reason
soon
finds
his
master
thus
nature
made
us
to
be
lower
than
animals
or
at
least
to
exhibit
all
the
more
because
of
that
native
inferiority
the
wonderful
efficacy
of
education
which
alone
raises
us
from
the
level
of
the
animals
and
lifts
us
above
them
but
shall
we
grant
this
same
distinction
to
the
deaf
and
to
the
blind
to
imbeciles
madmen
or
savages
or
to
those
who
have
been
brought
up
in
the
woods
with
animals
to
those
who
have
lost
their
imagination
through
melancholia
or
in
short
to
all
those
animals
in
human
form
who
give
evidence
of
only
the
rudest
instinct
no
all
these
men
of
body
but
not
of
mind
do
not
deserve
to
be
classed
by
themselves
we
do
not
intend
to
hide
from
ourselves
the
arguments
that
can
be
brought
forward
against
our
belief
and
in
favor
of
a
primitive
distinction
between
men
and
animals
some
say
that
there
is
in
man
a
natural
law
a
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
which
has
never
been
imprinted
on
the
heart
of
animals
but
is
this
objection
or
rather
this
assertion
based
on
observation
any
assertion
unfounded
on
observation
may
be
rejected
by
a
philosopher
have
we
ever
had
a
single
experience
which
convinces
us
that
man
alone
has
been
enlightened
by
a
ray
denied
all
other
animals
if
there
is
no
such
experience
we
can
no
more
know
what
goes
on
in
animals
minds
or
even
in
the
minds
of
other
men
than
we
can
help
feeling
what
affects
the
inner
part
of
our
own
being
we
know
that
we
think
and
feel
remorse
an
intimate
feeling
forces
us
to
recognize
this
only
too
well
but
this
feeling
in
us
is
insufficient
to
enable
us
to
judge
the
remorse
of
others
that
is
why
we
have
to
take
others
at
their
word
or
judge
them
by
the
sensible
and
external
signs
we
have
noticed
in
ourselves
when
we
experienced
the
same
accusations
of
conscience
and
the
same
torments
in
order
to
decide
whether
animals
which
do
not
talk
have
received
the
natural
law
we
must
therefore
have
recourse
to
those
signs
to
which
i
have
just
referred
if
any
such
exist
the
facts
seem
to
prove
it
a
dog
that
bit
the
master
who
was
teasing
it
seemed
to
repent
a
minute
afterwards
it
looked
sad
ashamed
afraid
to
show
itself
and
seemed
to
confess
its
guilt
by
a
crouching
and
downcast
air
history
offers
us
a
famous
example
of
a
lion
which
would
not
devour
a
man
abandoned
to
its
fury
because
it
recognized
him
as
its
benefactor
how
much
might
it
be
wished
that
man
himself
always
showed
the
same
gratitude
for
kindnesses
and
the
same
respect
for
humanity
then
we
should
no
longer
fear
either
ungrateful
wretches
or
wars
which
are
the
plague
of
the
human
race
and
the
real
executioners
of
the
natural
law
but
a
being
to
which
nature
has
given
such
a
precocious
and
enlightened
instinct
which
judges
combines
reasons
and
deliberates
as
far
as
the
sphere
of
its
activity
extends
and
permits
a
being
which
feels
attachment
because
of
benefits
received
and
which
leaving
a
master
who
treats
it
badly
goes
to
seek
a
better
one
a
being
with
a
structure
like
ours
which
performs
the
same
acts
has
the
same
passions
the
same
griefs
the
same
pleasures
more
or
less
intense
according
to
the
sway
of
the
imagination
and
the
delicacy
of
the
nervous
organization
does
not
such
a
being
show
clearly
that
it
knows
its
faults
and
ours
understands
good
and
evil
and
in
a
word
has
consciousness
of
what
it
does
would
its
soul
which
feels
the
same
joys
the
same
mortification
and
the
same
discomfiture
which
we
feel
remain
utterly
unmoved
by
disgust
when
it
saw
a
torn
to
bits
or
when
it
had
itself
pitilessly
dismembered
this
if
this
be
granted
it
follows
that
the
precious
gift
now
in
question
would
not
have
been
denied
to
animals
for
since
they
show
us
sure
signs
of
repentance
as
well
as
of
intelligence
what
is
there
absurd
in
thinking
that
beings
almost
as
perfect
machines
as
ourselves
are
like
us
made
to
understand
and
to
feel
nature
let
no
one
object
that
animals
for
the
most
part
are
savage
beasts
incapable
of
realizing
the
evil
that
they
do
for
do
all
men
discriminate
better
between
vice
and
virtue
there
is
ferocity
in
our
species
as
well
as
in
theirs
men
who
are
in
the
barbarous
habit
of
breaking
the
natural
law
are
not
tormented
as
much
by
it
as
those
who
transgress
it
for
the
first
time
and
who
have
not
been
hardened
by
the
force
of
habit
the
same
thing
is
true
of
animals
as
of
men
both
may
be
more
or
less
ferocious
in
temperament
and
both
become
more
so
by
living
with
others
like
themselves
but
a
gentle
and
peaceful
animal
which
lives
among
other
animals
of
the
same
disposition
and
of
gentle
nurture
will
be
an
enemy
of
blood
and
carnage
it
will
blush
internally
at
having
shed
blood
there
is
perhaps
this
difference
that
since
among
animals
everything
is
sacrificed
to
their
needs
to
their
pleasures
to
the
necessities
of
life
which
they
enjoy
more
than
we
their
remorse
apparently
should
not
be
as
keen
as
ours
because
we
are
not
in
the
same
state
of
necessity
as
they
custom
perhaps
dulls
and
perhaps
stifles
remorse
as
well
as
pleasures
but
i
will
suppose
for
a
moment
that
i
am
utterly
mistaken
in
concluding
that
almost
all
the
world
holds
a
wrong
opinion
on
this
subject
while
i
alone
am
right
i
will
grant
that
animals
even
the
best
of
them
do
not
know
the
difference
between
moral
good
and
evil
that
they
have
no
recollection
of
the
trouble
taken
for
them
of
the
kindness
done
them
no
realization
of
their
own
virtues
i
will
suppose
for
instance
that
this
lion
to
which
i
like
so
many
others
have
referred
does
not
remember
at
all
that
it
refused
to
kill
the
man
abandoned
to
its
fury
in
a
combat
more
inhuman
than
one
could
find
among
lions
tigers
and
bears
put
together
for
our
compatriots
fight
swiss
against
swiss
brother
against
brother
recognize
each
other
and
yet
capture
and
kill
each
other
without
remorse
because
a
prince
pays
for
the
murder
i
suppose
in
short
that
the
natural
law
has
not
been
given
animals
what
will
be
the
consequences
of
this
supposition
man
is
not
moulded
from
a
costlier
clay
nature
has
used
but
one
dough
and
has
merely
varied
the
leaven
therefore
if
animals
do
not
repent
for
having
violated
this
inmost
feeling
which
i
am
discussing
or
rather
if
they
absolutely
lack
it
man
must
necessarily
be
in
the
same
condition
farewell
then
to
the
natural
law
and
all
the
fine
treatises
published
about
it
the
whole
animal
kingdom
in
general
would
be
deprived
of
it
but
conversely
if
man
can
not
dispense
with
the
belief
that
when
health
permits
him
to
be
himself
he
always
distinguishes
the
upright
humane
and
virtuous
from
those
who
are
not
humane
virtuous
nor
honorable
that
it
is
easy
to
tell
vice
from
virtue
by
the
unique
pleasure
and
the
peculiar
repugnance
that
seem
to
be
their
natural
effects
it
follows
that
animals
composed
of
the
same
matter
lacking
perhaps
only
one
degree
of
fermentation
to
make
it
exactly
like
man
must
share
the
same
prerogatives
of
animal
nature
and
that
thus
there
exists
no
soul
or
sensitive
substance
without
remorse
the
following
consideration
will
reinforce
these
observations
it
is
impossible
to
destroy
the
natural
law
the
impress
of
it
on
all
animals
is
so
strong
that
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
wildest
and
most
savage
have
some
moments
of
repentance
i
believe
that
that
cruel
maid
of
chalons
in
champagne
must
have
sorrowed
for
her
crime
if
she
really
ate
her
sister
i
think
that
the
same
thing
is
true
of
all
those
who
commit
crimes
even
involuntary
or
temperamental
crimes
true
of
gaston
of
orleans
who
could
not
help
stealing
of
a
certain
woman
who
was
subject
to
the
same
crime
when
pregnant
and
whose
children
inherited
it
of
the
woman
who
in
the
same
condition
ate
her
husband
of
that
other
woman
who
killed
her
children
salted
their
bodies
and
ate
a
piece
of
them
every
day
as
a
little
relish
of
that
daughter
of
a
thief
and
cannibal
who
at
twelve
years
followed
in
his
steps
although
she
had
been
orphaned
when
she
was
a
year
old
and
had
been
brought
up
by
honest
people
to
say
nothing
of
many
other
examples
of
which
the
records
of
our
observers
are
full
all
of
them
proving
that
there
are
a
thousand
hereditary
vices
and
virtues
which
are
transmitted
from
parents
to
children
as
those
of
the
foster
mother
pass
to
the
children
she
nurses
now
i
believe
and
admit
that
these
wretches
do
not
for
the
most
part
feel
at
the
time
the
enormity
of
their
actions
bulimia
or
canine
hunger
for
example
can
stifle
all
feeling
it
is
a
mania
of
the
stomach
that
one
is
compelled
to
satisfy
but
what
remorse
must
be
in
store
for
those
women
when
they
come
to
themselves
and
grow
sober
and
remember
the
crimes
they
have
committed
against
those
they
held
most
dear
what
a
punishment
for
an
involuntary
crime
which
they
could
not
resist
of
which
they
had
no
consciousness
whatever
however
this
is
apparently
not
enough
for
the
judges
for
of
these
women
of
whom
i
tell
one
was
cruelly
beaten
and
burned
and
another
was
buried
alive
i
realize
all
that
is
demanded
by
the
interest
of
society
but
doubtless
it
is
much
to
be
wished
that
excellent
physicians
might
be
the
only
judges
they
alone
could
tell
the
innocent
criminal
from
the
guilty
if
reason
is
the
slave
of
a
depraved
or
mad
desire
how
can
it
control
the
desire
but
if
crime
carries
with
it
its
own
more
or
less
cruel
punishment
if
the
most
continued
and
most
barbarous
habit
can
not
entirely
blot
out
repentance
in
the
crudest
hearts
if
criminals
are
lacerated
by
the
very
memory
of
their
deeds
why
should
we
frighten
the
imagination
of
weak
minds
by
a
hell
by
specters
and
by
precipices
of
fire
even
less
real
than
those
of
pascal
why
must
we
have
recourse
to
fables
as
an
honest
pope
once
said
himself
to
torment
even
the
unhappy
wretches
who
are
executed
because
we
do
not
think
that
they
are
sufficiently
punished
by
their
own
conscience
their
first
executioner
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
all
criminals
are
unjustly
punished
i
only
maintain
that
those
whose
will
is
depraved
and
whose
conscience
is
extinguished
are
punished
enough
by
their
remorse
when
they
come
to
themselves
a
remorse
i
venture
to
assert
from
which
nature
should
in
this
case
have
delivered
unhappy
souls
dragged
on
by
a
fatal
necessity
criminals
scoundrels
ingrates
those
in
short
without
natural
feelings
unhappy
tyrants
who
are
unworthy
of
life
in
vain
take
a
cruel
pleasure
in
their
barbarity
for
there
are
calm
moments
of
reflection
in
which
the
avenging
conscience
arises
testifies
against
them
and
condemns
them
to
be
almost
ceaselessly
torn
to
pieces
at
their
own
hands
whoever
torments
men
is
tormented
by
himself
and
the
sufferings
that
he
will
experience
will
be
the
just
measure
of
those
that
he
has
inflicted
on
the
other
hand
there
is
so
much
pleasure
in
doing
good
in
recognizing
and
appreciating
what
one
receives
so
much
satisfaction
in
practising
virtue
in
being
gentle
humane
kind
charitable
compassionate
and
generous
for
this
one
word
includes
all
the
virtues
that
i
consider
as
sufficiently
punished
any
one
who
is
unfortunate
enough
not
to
have
been
born
virtuous
we
were
not
originally
made
to
be
learned
we
have
become
so
perhaps
by
a
sort
of
abuse
of
our
organic
faculties
and
at
the
expense
of
the
state
which
nourishes
a
host
of
sluggards
whom
vanity
has
adorned
with
the
name
of
philosophers
nature
has
created
us
all
solely
to
be
happy
yes
all
of
us
from
the
crawling
worm
to
the
eagle
lost
in
the
clouds
for
this
cause
she
has
given
all
animals
some
share
of
natural
law
a
share
greater
or
less
according
to
the
needs
of
each
animal
organs
when
in
normal
condition
now
how
shall
we
define
natural
law
it
is
a
feeling
that
teaches
us
what
we
should
not
do
because
we
would
not
wish
it
to
be
done
to
us
should
i
dare
add
to
this
common
idea
that
this
feeling
seems
to
me
but
a
kind
of
fear
or
dread
as
salutary
to
the
race
as
to
the
individual
for
may
it
not
be
true
that
we
respect
the
purse
and
life
of
others
only
to
save
our
own
possessions
our
honor
and
ourselves
like
those
ixions
of
christianity
who
love
god
and
embrace
so
many
fantastic
virtues
merely
because
they
are
afraid
of
hell
you
see
that
natural
law
is
but
an
intimate
feeling
that
like
all
other
feelings
thought
included
belongs
also
to
imagination
evidently
therefore
natural
law
does
not
presuppose
education
revelation
nor
legislator
provided
one
does
not
propose
to
confuse
natural
law
with
civil
laws
in
the
ridiculous
fashion
of
the
theologians
the
arms
of
fanaticism
may
destroy
those
who
support
these
truths
but
they
will
never
destroy
the
truths
themselves
i
do
not
mean
to
call
in
question
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being
on
the
contrary
it
seems
to
me
that
the
greatest
degree
of
probability
is
in
favor
of
this
belief
but
since
the
existence
of
this
being
goes
no
further
than
that
of
any
other
toward
proving
the
need
of
worship
it
is
a
theoretic
truth
with
very
little
practical
value
therefore
since
we
may
say
after
such
long
experience
that
religion
does
not
imply
exact
honesty
we
are
authorized
by
the
same
reasons
to
think
that
atheism
does
not
exclude
it
furthermore
who
can
be
sure
that
the
reason
for
man
existence
is
not
simply
the
fact
that
he
exists
perhaps
he
was
thrown
by
chance
on
some
spot
on
the
earth
surface
nobody
knows
how
nor
why
but
simply
that
he
must
live
and
die
like
the
mushrooms
which
appear
from
day
to
day
or
like
those
flowers
which
border
the
ditches
and
cover
the
walls
let
us
not
lose
ourselves
in
the
infinite
for
we
are
not
made
to
have
the
least
idea
thereof
and
are
absolutely
unable
to
get
back
to
the
origin
of
things
besides
it
does
not
matter
for
our
peace
of
mind
whether
matter
be
eternal
or
have
been
created
whether
there
be
or
be
not
a
god
how
foolish
to
torment
ourselves
so
much
about
things
which
we
can
not
know
and
which
would
not
make
us
any
happier
even
were
we
to
gain
knowledge
about
them
but
some
will
say
read
all
such
works
as
those
of
f√©nelon
of
nieuwentyt
of
abadie
of
derham
of
rais
and
the
rest
well
what
will
they
teach
me
or
rather
what
have
they
taught
me
they
are
only
tiresome
repetitions
of
zealous
writers
one
of
whom
adds
to
the
other
only
verbiage
more
likely
to
strengthen
than
to
undermine
the
foundations
of
atheism
the
number
of
the
evidences
drawn
from
the
spectacle
of
nature
does
not
give
these
evidences
any
more
force
either
the
mere
structure
of
a
finger
of
an
ear
of
an
eye
a
single
observation
of
malpighi
proves
all
and
doubtless
much
better
than
descartes
and
malebranche
proved
it
or
all
the
other
evidences
prove
nothing
deists
and
even
christians
should
therefore
be
content
to
point
out
that
throughout
the
animal
kingdom
the
same
aims
are
pursued
and
accomplished
by
an
infinite
number
of
different
mechanisms
all
of
them
however
exactly
geometrical
for
what
stronger
weapons
could
there
be
with
which
to
overthrow
atheists
it
is
true
that
if
my
reason
does
not
deceive
me
man
and
the
whole
universe
seem
to
have
been
designed
for
this
unity
of
aim
the
sun
air
water
the
organism
the
shape
of
bodies
everything
is
brought
to
a
focus
in
the
eye
as
in
a
mirror
that
faithfully
presents
to
the
imagination
all
the
objects
reflected
in
it
in
accordance
with
the
laws
required
by
the
infinite
variety
of
bodies
which
take
part
in
vision
in
ears
we
find
everywhere
a
striking
variety
and
yet
the
difference
of
structure
in
men
animals
birds
and
fishes
does
not
produce
different
uses
all
ears
are
so
mathematically
made
that
they
tend
equally
to
one
and
the
same
end
namely
hearing
but
would
chance
the
deist
asks
be
a
great
enough
geometrician
to
vary
thus
at
pleasure
the
works
of
which
she
is
supposed
to
be
the
author
without
being
hindered
by
so
great
a
diversity
from
gaining
the
same
end
again
the
deist
will
bring
forward
as
a
difficulty
those
parts
of
the
animal
that
are
clearly
contained
in
it
for
future
use
the
butterfly
in
the
caterpillar
man
in
the
sperm
a
whole
polyp
in
each
of
its
parts
the
valvule
in
the
oval
orifice
the
lungs
in
the
foetus
the
teeth
in
their
sockets
the
bones
in
the
fluid
from
which
they
detach
themselves
and
in
an
incomprehensible
manner
harden
and
since
the
partisans
of
this
theory
far
from
neglecting
anything
that
would
strengthen
it
never
tire
of
piling
up
proof
upon
proof
they
are
willing
to
avail
themselves
of
everything
even
of
the
weakness
of
the
mind
in
certain
cases
look
they
say
at
men
like
spinoza
vanini
desbarreau
and
boindin
apostles
who
honor
deism
more
than
they
harm
it
the
duration
of
their
health
was
the
measure
of
their
unbelief
and
one
rarely
fails
they
add
to
renounce
atheism
when
the
passions
with
their
instrument
the
body
have
grown
weak
that
is
certainly
the
most
that
can
be
said
in
favor
of
the
existence
of
god
although
the
last
argument
is
frivolous
in
that
these
conversions
are
short
and
the
mind
almost
always
regains
its
former
opinions
and
acts
accordingly
as
soon
as
it
has
regained
or
rather
rediscovered
its
strength
in
that
of
the
body
that
is
at
least
much
more
than
was
said
by
the
physician
diderot
in
his
pens√©es
philosophiques
a
sublime
work
that
will
not
convince
a
single
atheist
what
reply
can
in
truth
be
made
to
a
man
who
says
we
do
not
know
nature
causes
hidden
in
her
breast
might
have
produced
everything
in
your
turn
observe
the
polyp
of
trembley
does
it
not
contain
in
itself
the
causes
which
bring
about
regeneration
why
then
would
it
be
absurd
to
think
that
there
are
physical
causes
by
reason
of
which
everything
has
been
made
and
to
which
the
whole
chain
of
this
vast
universe
is
so
necessarily
bound
and
held
that
nothing
which
happens
could
have
failed
to
happen
causes
of
which
we
are
so
invincibly
ignorant
that
we
have
had
recourse
to
a
god
who
as
some
aver
is
not
so
much
as
a
logical
entity
thus
to
destroy
chance
is
not
to
prove
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being
since
there
may
be
some
other
thing
which
is
neither
chance
nor
god
i
mean
nature
it
follows
that
the
study
of
nature
can
make
only
unbelievers
and
the
way
of
thinking
of
all
its
more
successful
investigators
proves
this
the
weight
of
the
universe
therefore
far
from
crushing
a
real
atheist
does
not
even
shake
him
all
these
evidences
of
a
creator
repeated
thousands
and
thousands
of
times
evidences
that
are
placed
far
above
the
comprehension
of
men
like
us
are
however
far
one
push
the
argument
only
to
the
or
to
those
who
have
enough
confidence
in
their
reason
to
believe
themselves
capable
of
judging
on
the
basis
of
certain
phenomena
against
which
as
you
see
the
atheists
can
urge
others
perhaps
equally
strong
and
absolutely
opposed
for
if
we
listen
to
the
naturalists
again
they
will
tell
us
that
the
very
causes
which
in
a
chemist
hands
by
a
chance
combination
made
the
first
mirror
in
the
hands
of
nature
made
the
pure
water
the
mirror
of
the
simple
shepherdess
that
the
motion
which
keeps
the
world
going
could
have
created
it
that
each
body
has
taken
the
place
assigned
to
it
by
its
own
nature
that
the
air
must
have
surrounded
the
earth
and
that
iron
and
the
other
metals
are
produced
by
internal
motions
of
the
earth
for
one
and
the
same
reason
that
the
sun
is
as
much
a
natural
product
as
electricity
that
it
was
not
made
to
warm
the
earth
and
its
inhabitants
whom
it
sometimes
burns
any
more
than
the
rain
was
made
to
make
the
seeds
grow
which
it
often
spoils
that
the
mirror
and
the
water
were
no
more
made
for
people
to
see
themselves
in
than
were
all
other
polished
bodies
with
this
same
property
that
the
eye
is
in
truth
a
kind
of
glass
in
which
the
soul
can
contemplate
the
image
of
objects
as
they
are
presented
to
it
by
these
bodies
but
that
it
is
not
proved
that
this
organ
was
really
made
expressly
for
this
contemplation
nor
purposely
placed
in
its
socket
and
in
short
that
it
may
well
be
that
lucretius
the
physician
lamy
and
all
epicureans
both
ancient
and
modern
were
right
when
they
suggested
that
the
eye
sees
only
because
it
is
formed
and
placed
as
it
is
and
that
given
once
for
all
the
same
rules
of
motion
followed
by
nature
in
the
generation
and
development
of
bodies
this
marvelous
organ
could
not
have
been
formed
and
placed
differently
such
is
the
pro
and
the
con
and
the
summary
of
those
fine
arguments
that
will
eternally
divide
the
philosophers
i
do
not
take
either
side
non
nostrum
inter
vos
tantas
componere
lites
this
is
what
i
said
to
one
of
my
friends
a
frenchman
as
frank
a
pyrronian
as
i
a
man
of
much
merit
and
worthy
of
a
better
fate
he
gave
me
a
very
singular
answer
in
regard
to
the
matter
it
is
true
he
told
me
that
the
pro
and
con
should
not
disturb
at
all
the
soul
of
a
philosopher
who
sees
that
nothing
is
proved
with
clearness
enough
to
force
his
consent
and
that
the
arguments
offered
on
one
side
are
neutralized
by
those
of
the
other
however
he
continued
the
universe
will
never
be
happy
unless
it
is
atheistic
here
are
this
wretch
reasons
if
atheism
said
he
were
generally
accepted
all
the
forms
of
religion
would
then
be
destroyed
and
cut
off
at
the
roots
no
more
theological
wars
no
more
soldiers
of
religion
such
terrible
soldiers
nature
infected
with
a
sacred
poison
would
regain
its
rights
and
its
purity
deaf
to
all
other
voices
tranquil
mortals
would
follow
only
the
spontaneous
dictates
of
their
own
being
the
only
commands
which
can
never
be
despised
with
impunity
and
which
alone
can
lead
us
to
happiness
through
the
pleasant
paths
of
virtue
such
is
natural
law
whoever
rigidly
observes
it
is
a
good
man
and
deserves
the
confidence
of
all
the
human
race
whoever
fails
to
follow
it
scrupulously
affects
in
vain
the
specious
exterior
of
another
religion
he
is
a
scamp
or
a
hypocrite
whom
i
distrust
after
this
let
a
vain
people
think
otherwise
let
them
dare
affirm
that
even
probity
is
at
stake
in
not
believing
in
revelation
in
a
word
that
another
religion
than
that
of
nature
is
necessary
whatever
it
may
be
such
an
assertion
is
wretched
and
pitiable
and
so
is
the
good
opinion
which
each
one
gives
us
of
the
religion
he
has
embraced
we
do
not
seek
here
the
votes
of
the
crowd
whoever
raises
in
his
heart
altars
to
superstition
is
born
to
worship
idols
and
not
to
thrill
to
virtue
but
since
all
the
faculties
of
the
soul
depend
to
such
a
degree
on
the
proper
organization
of
the
brain
and
of
the
whole
body
that
apparently
they
are
but
this
organization
itself
the
soul
is
clearly
an
enlightened
machine
for
finally
even
if
man
alone
had
received
a
share
of
natural
law
would
he
be
any
less
a
machine
for
that
a
few
more
wheels
a
few
more
springs
than
in
the
most
perfect
animals
the
brain
proportionally
nearer
the
heart
and
for
this
very
reason
receiving
more
blood
any
one
of
a
number
of
unknown
causes
might
always
produce
this
delicate
conscience
so
easily
wounded
this
remorse
which
is
no
more
foreign
to
matter
than
to
thought
and
in
a
word
all
the
differences
that
are
supposed
to
exist
here
could
the
organism
then
suffice
for
everything
once
more
yes
since
thought
visibly
develops
with
our
organs
why
should
not
the
matter
of
which
they
are
composed
be
susceptible
of
remorse
also
when
once
it
has
acquired
with
time
the
faculty
of
feeling
the
soul
is
therefore
but
an
empty
word
of
which
no
one
has
any
idea
and
which
an
enlightened
man
should
use
only
to
signify
the
part
in
us
that
thinks
given
the
least
principle
of
motion
animated
bodies
will
have
all
that
is
necessary
for
moving
feeling
thinking
repenting
or
in
a
word
for
conducting
themselves
in
the
physical
realm
and
in
the
moral
realm
which
depends
upon
it
yet
we
take
nothing
for
granted
those
who
perhaps
think
that
all
the
difficulties
have
not
yet
been
removed
shall
now
read
of
experiments
that
will
completely
satisfy
them
the
flesh
of
all
animals
palpitates
after
death
this
palpitation
continues
longer
the
more
cold
blooded
the
animal
is
and
the
less
it
perspires
tortoises
lizards
serpents
etc
are
evidence
of
this
muscles
separated
from
the
body
contract
when
they
are
stimulated
the
intestines
keep
up
their
peristaltic
or
vermicular
motion
for
a
long
time
according
to
cowper
a
simple
injection
of

for

more
after
it

from

especially
when
exposed

or
better
still
when
placed
on
a
hot
table
or

if
this
movement
seems
totally
lost
one

only
to
stimulate
the

beats

made
this

observation
on

bacon
of

cites
the
case
of
a
man
convicted
of

you
will
observe
the

the

conditions

an
animal

which
we
owe
to
boyle
and
to
st√©non
are
made
on
pigeons
dogs
and
rabbits
pieces
of
their
hearts
beat
as
their
whole
hearts
would
the
same
movements
can
be
seen
in
paws
that
have
been
cut
off
from
moles
the
caterpillar
the
worm
the
spider
the
fly
the
eel
all
exhibit
the
same
phenomena
and
in
hot
water
because
of
the
fire
it
contains
the
movement
of
the
detached
parts
increases
a
drunken
soldier
cut
off
with
one
stroke
of
his
sabre
an
indian
rooster
head
the
animal
remained
standing
then
walked
and
ran
happening
to
run
against
a
wall
it
turned
around
beat
its
wings
still
running
and
finally
fell
down
as
it
lay
on
the
ground
all
the
muscles
of
this
rooster
kept
on
moving
that
is
what
i
saw
myself
and
almost
the
same
phenomena
can
easily
be
observed
in
kittens
or
puppies
with
their
heads
cut
off
polyps
do
more
than
move
after
they
have
been
cut
in
pieces
in
a
week
they
regenerate
to
form
as
many
animals
as
there
are
pieces
i
am
sorry
that
these
facts
speak
against
the
naturalists
system
of
generation
or
rather
i
am
very
glad
of
it
for
let
this
discovery
teach
us
never
to
reach
a
general
conclusion
even
on
the
ground
of
all
known
and
most
decisive
experiments
here
we
have
many
more
facts
than
are
needed
to
prove
in
an
incontestable
way
that
each
tiny
fibre
or
part
of
an
organized
body
moves
by
a
principle
which
belongs
to
it
its
activity
unlike
voluntary
motions
does
not
depend
in
any
way
on
the
nerves
since
the
movements
in
question
occur
in
parts
of
the
body
which
have
no
connection
with
the
circulation
but
if
this
force
is
manifested
even
in
sections
of
fibres
the
heart
which
is
a
composite
of
peculiarly
connected
fibres
must
possess
the
same
property
i
did
not
need
bacon
story
to
persuade
me
of
this
it
was
easy
for
me
to
come
to
this
conclusion
both
from
the
perfect
analogy
of
the
structure
of
the
human
heart
with
that
of
animals
and
also
from
the
very
bulk
of
the
human
heart
in
which
this
movement
escapes
our
eyes
only
because
it
is
smothered
and
finally
because
in
corpses
all
the
organs
are
cold
and
lifeless
if
executed
criminals
were
dissected
while
their
bodies
are
still
warm
we
should
probably
see
in
their
hearts
the
same
movements
that
are
observed
in
the
of
those
that
have
been
beheaded
the
motive
principle
of
the
whole
body
and
even
of
its
parts
cut
in
pieces
is
such
that
it
produces
not
irregular
movements
as
some
have
thought
but
very
regular
ones
in
warm
blooded
and
perfect
animals
as
well
as
in
cold
and
imperfect
ones
no
resource
therefore
remains
open
to
our
adversaries
but
to
deny
thousands
and
thousands
of
facts
which
every
man
can
easily
verify
if
now
any
one
ask
me
where
is
this
innate
force
in
our
bodies
i
answer
that
it
very
clearly
resides
in
what
the
ancients
called
the
parenchyma
that
is
to
say
in
the
very
substance
of
the
organs
not
including
the
veins
the
arteries
the
nerves
in
a
word
that
it
resides
in
the
organization
of
the
whole
body
and
that
consequently
each
organ
contains
within
itself
forces
more
or
less
active
according
to
the
need
of
them
let
us
now
go
into
some
detail
concerning
these
springs
of
the
human
machine
all
the
vital
animal
natural
and
automatic
motions
are
carried
on
by
their
action
is
it
not
in
a
purely
mechanical
way
that
the
body
shrinks
back
when
it
is
struck
with
terror
at
the
sight
of
an
unforeseen
precipice
that
the
eyelids
are
lowered
at
the
menace
of
a
blow
as
some
have
remarked
and
that
the
pupil
contracts
in
broad
daylight
to
save
the
retina
and
dilates
to
see
objects
in
darkness
is
it
not
by
mechanical
means
that
the
pores
of
the
skin
close
in
winter
so
that
the
cold
can
not
penetrate
to
the
interior
of
the
blood
vessels
and
that
the
stomach
vomits
when
it
is
irritated
by
poison
by
a
certain
quantity
of
opium
and
by
all
emetics
that
the
heart
the
arteries
and
the
muscles
contract
in
sleep
as
well
as
in
waking
hours
that
the
lungs
serve
as
bellows
continually
in
exercise
that
the
heart
contracts
more
strongly
than
any
other
muscle
i
shall
not
go
into
any
more
detail
concerning
all
these
little
subordinate
forces
well
known
to
all
but
there
is
another
more
subtle
and
marvelous
force
which
animates
them
all
it
is
the
source
of
all
our
feelings
of
all
our
pleasures
of
all
our
passions
and
of
all
our
thoughts
for
the
brain
has
its
muscles
for
thinking
as
the
legs
have
muscles
for
walking
i
wish
to
speak
of
this
impetuous
principle
that
hippocrates
calls
enorm√¥n
soul
this
principle
exists
and
has
its
seat
in
the
brain
at
the
origin
of
the
nerves
by
which
it
exercises
its
control
over
all
the
rest
of
the
body
by
this
fact
is
explained
all
that
can
be
explained
even
to
the
surprising
effects
of
maladies
of
the
imagination
look
at
the
portrait
of
the
famous
pope
who
is
to
say
the
least
the
voltaire
of
the
english
the
effort
the
energy
of
his
genius
are
imprinted
upon
his
countenance
it
is
convulsed
his
eyes
protrude
from
their
sockets
the
eyebrows
are
raised
with
the
muscles
of
the
forehead
why
because
the
brain
is
in
travail
and
all
the
body
must
share
in
such
a
laborious
deliverance
if
there
were
not
an
internal
cord
which
pulled
the
external
ones
whence
would
come
all
these
phenomena
to
admit
a
soul
as
explanation
of
them
is
to
be
reduced
to
explaining
phenomena
by
the
operations
of
the
holy
spirit
in
fact
if
what
thinks
in
my
brain
is
not
a
part
of
this
organ
and
therefore
of
the
whole
body
why
does
my
blood
boil
and
the
fever
of
my
mind
pass
into
my
veins
when
lying
quietly
in
bed
i
am
forming
the
plan
of
some
work
or
carrying
on
an
abstract
calculation
put
this
question
to
men
of
imagination
to
great
poets
to
men
who
are
enraptured
by
the
felicitous
expression
of
sentiment
and
transported
by
an
exquisite
fancy
or
by
the
charms
of
nature
of
truth
or
of
virtue
by
their
enthusiasm
by
what
they
will
tell
you
they
have
experienced
you
will
judge
the
cause
by
its
effects
by
that
harmony
which
borelli
a
mere
anatomist
understood
better
than
all
the
leibnizians
you
will
comprehend
the
material
unity
of
man
in
short
if
the
which
causes
pain
occasions
also
the
fever
by
which
the
distracted
mind
loses
its
and
if
conversely
the
mind
too
much
excited
disturbs
the
body
and
kindles
that
inner
fire
which
killed
bayle
while
he
was
still
so
young
if
an
agitation
rouses
my
desire
and
my
ardent
wish
for
what
a
moment
ago
i
cared
nothing
about
and
if
in
their
turn
certain
brain
impressions
excite
the
same
longing
and
the
same
desires
then
why
should
we
regard
as
double
what
is
manifestly
one
being
in
vain
you
fall
back
on
the
power
of
the
will
since
for
one
order
that
the
will
gives
it
bows
a
hundred
times
to
the
yoke
and
what
wonder
that
in
health
the
body
obeys
since
a
torrent
of
blood
and
of
animal
spirits
forces
its
obedience
and
since
the
will
has
as
ministers
an
invisible
legion
of
fluids
swifter
than
lightning
and
ever
ready
to
do
its
bidding
but
as
the
power
of
the
will
is
exercised
by
means
of
the
nerves
it
is
likewise
limited
by
them
does
the
result
of
jaundice
surprise
you
do
you
not
know
that
the
color
of
bodies
depends
on
the
color
of
the
glasses
through
which
we
look
at
them
and
that
whatever
is
the
color
of
the
humors
such
is
the
color
of
objects
at
least
for
us
vain
playthings
of
a
thousand
illusions
but
remove
this
color
from
the
aqueous
humor
of
the
eye
let
the
bile
flow
through
its
natural
filter
then
the
soul
having
new
eyes
will
no
longer
see
yellow
again
is
it
not
thus
by
removing
cataract
or
by
injecting
the
eustachian
canal
that
sight
is
restored
to
the
blind
or
hearing
to
the
deaf
how
many
people
who
were
perhaps
only
clever
charlatans
passed
for
miracle
workers
in
the
dark
ages
beautiful
the
soul
and
powerful
the
will
which
can
not
act
save
by
permission
of
the
bodily
conditions
and
whose
tastes
change
with
age
and
fever
should
we
then
be
astonished
that
philosophers
have
always
had
in
mind
the
health
of
the
body
to
preserve
the
health
of
the
soul
that
pythagoras
gave
rules
for
the
diet
as
carefully
as
plato
forbade
wine
the
regime
suited
to
the
body
is
always
the
one
with
which
sane
physicians
think
they
must
begin
when
it
is
a
question
of
forming
the
mind
and
of
instructing
it
in
the
knowledge
of
truth
and
virtue
but
these
are
vain
words
in
the
disorder
of
illness
and
in
the
tumult
of
the
senses
without
the
precepts
of
hygiene
epictetus
socrates
plato
and
the
rest
preach
in
vain
all
ethics
is
fruitless
for
one
who
lacks
his
share
of
temperance
it
is
the
source
of
all
virtues
as
intemperance
is
the
source
of
all
vices
is
more
needed
for
why
lose
myself
in
discussion
of
the
passions
which
are
all
explained
by
the
term
enorm√¥n
of
hippocrates
to
prove
that
man
is
but
an
animal
or
a
collection
of
springs
which
wind
each
other
up
without
our
being
able
to
tell
at
what
point
in
this
human
circle
nature
has
begun
if
these
springs
differ
among
themselves
these
differences
consist
only
in
their
position
and
in
their
degrees
of
strength
and
never
in
their
nature
wherefore
the
soul
is
but
a
principle
of
motion
or
a
material
and
sensible
part
of
the
brain
which
can
be
regarded
without
fear
of
error
as
the
mainspring
of
the
whole
machine
having
a
visible
influence
on
all
the
parts
the
soul
seems
even
to
have
been
made
for
the
brain
so
that
all
the
other
parts
of
the
system
are
but
a
kind
of
emanation
from
the
brain
this
will
appear
from
certain
observations
made
on
different
embryos
which
i
shall
now
enumerate
this
oscillation
which
is
natural
or
suited
to
our
machine
and
with
which
each
fibre
and
even
each
fibrous
element
so
to
speak
seems
to
be
endowed
like
that
of
a
pendulum
can
not
keep
up
forever
it
must
be
renewed
as
it
loses
strength
invigorated
when
it
is
tired
and
weakened
when
it
is
disturbed
by
excess
of
strength
and
vigor
in
this
alone
true
medicine
consists
the
body
is
but
a
watch
whose
watchmaker
is
the
new
chyle
first
care
when
the
chyle
enters
the
blood
is
to
excite
in
it
a
kind
of
fever
which
the
chemists
who
dream
only
of
retorts
must
have
taken
for
fermentation
this
fever
produces
a
greater
filtration
of
spirits
which
mechanically
animate
the
muscles
and
the
heart
as
if
they
had
been
sent
there
by
order
of
the
will
these
then
are
the
causes
or
the
forces
of
life
which
thus
sustain
for
a
hundred
years
that
perpetual
movement
of
the
solids
and
the
liquids
which
is
as
necessary
to
the
first
as
to
the
second
but
who
can
say
whether
the
solids
contribute
more
than
the
fluids
to
this
movement
or
vice
versa
all
that
we
know
is
that
the
action
of
the
former
would
soon
cease
without
the
help
of
the
latter
that
is
without
the
help
of
the
fluids
which
by
their
onset
rouse
and
maintain
the
elasticity
of
the
blood
vessels
on
which
their
own
circulation
depends
from
this
it
follows
that
after
death
the
natural
resilience
of
each
substance
is
still
more
or
less
strong
according
to
the
remnants
of
life
which
it
outlives
being
the
last
to
perish
so
true
is
it
that
this
force
of
the
animal
parts
can
be
preserved
and
strengthened
by
that
of
the
circulation
but
that
it
does
not
depend
on
the
strength
of
the
circulation
since
as
we
have
seen
it
can
dispense
with
even
the
integrity
of
each
member
or
organ
i
am
aware
that
this
opinion
has
not
been
relished
by
all
scholars
and
that
stahl
especially
had
much
scorn
for
it
this
great
chemist
has
wished
to
persuade
us
that
the
soul
is
the
sole
cause
of
all
our
movements
but
this
is
to
speak
as
a
fanatic
and
not
as
a
philosopher
to
destroy
the
hypothesis
of
stahl
we
need
not
make
as
great
an
effort
as
i
find
that
others
have
done
before
me
we
need
only
glance
at
a
violinist
what
flexibility
what
lightness
in
his
fingers
the
movements
are
so
quick
that
it
seems
almost
as
if
there
were
no
succession
but
i
pray
or
rather
i
challenge
the
followers
of
stahl
who
understand
so
perfectly
all
that
our
soul
can
do
to
tell
me
how
it
could
possibly
execute
so
many
motions
so
quickly
motions
moreover
which
take
place
so
far
from
the
soul
and
in
so
many
different
places
that
is
to
suppose
that
a
flute
player
could
play
brilliant
cadences
on
an
infinite
number
of
holes
that
he
could
not
know
and
on
which
he
could
not
even
put
his
finger
but
let
us
say
with
hecquet
that
all
men
may
not
go
to
corinth
why
should
not
stahl
have
been
even
more
favored
by
nature
as
a
man
than
as
a
chemist
and
a
practitioner
happy
mortal
he
must
have
received
a
soul
different
from
that
of
the
rest
of
mankind
a
sovereign
soul
which
not
content
with
having
some
control
over
the
voluntary
muscles
easily
held
the
reins
of
all
the
movements
of
the
body
and
could
suspend
them
calm
them
or
excite
them
at
its
pleasure
with
so
despotic
a
mistress
in
whose
hands
were
in
a
sense
the
beating
of
the
heart
and
the
laws
of
circulation
there
could
certainly
be
no
fever
no
pain
no
weariness
the
soul
wills
and
the
springs
play
contract
or
relax
but
how
did
the
springs
of
stahl
machine
get
out
of
order
so
soon
he
who
has
in
himself
so
great
a
doctor
should
be
immortal
moreover
stahl
is
not
the
only
one
who
has
rejected
the
principle
of
the
vibration
of
organic
bodies
greater
minds
have
not
used
the
principle
when
they
wished
to
explain
the
action
of
the
heart
etc
one
need
only
read
the
institutions
of
medicine
by
boerhaave
to
see
what
laborious
and
enticing
systems
this
great
man
was
obliged
to
invent
by
the
labor
of
his
mighty
genius
through
failure
to
admit
that
there
is
so
wonderful
a
force
in
all
bodies
willis
and
perrault
minds
of
a
more
feeble
stamp
but
careful
observers
of
nature
whereas
nature
was
known
to
the
famous
leyden
professor
only
through
others
and
second
hand
so
to
speak
seem
to
have
preferred
to
suppose
a
soul
generally
extended
over
the
whole
body
instead
of
the
principle
which
we
are
describing
but
according
to
this
hypothesis
which
was
the
hypothesis
of
vergil
and
of
all
epicureans
an
hypothesis
which
the
history
of
the
polyp
might
seem
at
first
sight
to
favor
the
movements
which
go
on
after
the
death
of
the
subject
in
which
they
inhere
are
due
to
a
remnant
of
soul
still
maintained
by
the
parts
that
contract
though
from
the
moment
of
death
these
are
not
excited
by
the
blood
and
the
spirits
whence
it
may
be
seen
that
these
writers
whose
solid
works
easily
eclipse
all
philosophic
fables
are
deceived
only
in
the
manner
of
those
who
have
endowed
matter
with
the
faculty
of
thinking
i
mean
to
say
by
having
expressed
themselves
badly
in
obscure
and
meaningless
terms
in
truth
what
is
this
remnant
of
a
soul
if
it
is
not
the
moving
force
of
the
leibnizians
badly
rendered
by
such
an
expression
which
however
perrault
in
particular
has
really
foreseen
see
his
treatise
on
the
mechanism
of
animals
now
that
it
is
clearly
proved
against
the
cartesians
the
followers
of
stahl
the
malebranchists
and
the
theologians
who
little
deserve
to
be
mentioned
here
that
matter
is
not
only
when
organized
as
in
a
whole
heart
for
example
but
even
when
this
organization
has
been
destroyed
human
curiosity
would
like
to
discover
how
a
body
by
the
fact
that
it
is
originally
endowed
with
the
breath
of
life
finds
itself
adorned
in
consequence
with
the
faculty
of
feeling
and
thus
with
that
of
thought
and
heavens
what
efforts
have
not
been
made
by
certain
philosophers
to
manage
to
prove
this
and
what
nonsense
on
this
subject
i
have
had
the
patience
to
read
all
that
experience
teaches
us
is
that
while
movement
persists
however
slight
it
may
be
in
one
or
more
fibres
we
need
only
stimulate
them
to
and
animate
this
movement
almost
extinguished
this
has
been
shown
in
the
host
of
experiments
with
which
i
have
undertaken
to
crush
the
systems
it
is
therefore
certain
that
motion
and
feeling
excite
each
other
in
turn
both
in
a
whole
body
and
in
the
same
body
when
its
structure
is
destroyed
to
say
nothing
of
certain
plants
which
seem
to
exhibit
the
same
phenomena
of
the
union
of
feeling
and
motion
but
furthermore
how
many
excellent
philosophers
have
shown
that
thought
is
but
a
faculty
of
feeling
and
that
the
reasonable
soul
is
but
the
feeling
soul
engaged
in
contemplating
its
ideas
and
in
reasoning
this
would
be
proved
by
the
fact
alone
that
when
feeling
is
stifled
thought
also
is
checked
for
instance
in
apoplexy
in
lethargy
in
catalepsis
etc
for
it
is
ridiculous
to
suggest
that
during
these
stupors
the
soul
keeps
on
thinking
even
though
it
does
not
remember
the
ideas
that
it
has
had
as
to
the
development
of
feeling
and
motion
it
is
absurd
to
waste
time
seeking
for
its
mechanism
the
nature
of
motion
is
as
unknown
to
us
as
that
of
matter
how
can
we
discover
how
it
is
produced
unless
like
the
author
of
the
history
of
the
soul
we
resuscitate
the
old
and
unintelligible
doctrine
of
substantial
forms
i
am
then
quite
as
content
not
to
know
how
inert
and
simple
matter
becomes
active
and
highly
organized
as
not
to
be
able
to
look
at
the
sun
without
red
glasses
and
i
am
as
little
disquieted
concerning
the
other
incomprehensible
wonders
of
nature
the
production
of
feeling
and
of
thought
in
a
being
which
earlier
appeared
to
our
limited
eyes
as
a
mere
clod
of
clay
grant
only
that
organized
matter
is
endowed
with
a
principle
of
motion
which
alone
differentiates
it
from
the
inorganic
and
can
one
deny
this
in
the
face
of
the
most
incontestable
observation
and
that
among
animals
as
i
have
sufficiently
proved
everything
depends
upon
the
diversity
of
this
organization
these
admissions
suffice
for
guessing
the
riddle
of
substances
and
of
man
it
thus
appears
that
there
is
but
one
type
of
organization
in
the
universe
and
that
man
is
the
most
perfect
example
he
is
to
the
ape
and
to
the
most
intelligent
animals
as
the
planetary
pendulum
of
huyghens
is
to
a
watch
of
julien
leroy
more
instruments
more
wheels
and
more
springs
were
necessary
to
mark
the
movements
of
the
planets
than
to
mark
or
strike
the
hours
and
vaucanson
who
needed
more
skill
for
making
his
flute
player
than
for
making
his
duck
would
have
needed
still
more
to
make
a
talking
man
a
mechanism
no
longer
to
be
regarded
as
impossible
especially
in
the
hands
of
another
prometheus
in
like
fashion
it
was
necessary
that
nature
should
use
more
elaborate
art
in
making
and
sustaining
a
machine
which
for
a
whole
century
could
mark
all
motions
of
the
heart
and
of
the
mind
for
though
one
does
not
tell
time
by
the
pulse
it
is
at
least
the
barometer
of
the
warmth
and
the
vivacity
by
which
one
may
estimate
the
nature
of
the
soul
i
am
right
the
human
body
is
a
watch
a
large
watch
constructed
with
such
skill
and
ingenuity
that
if
the
wheel
which
marks
the
seconds
happens
to
stop
the
minute
wheel
turns
and
keeps
on
going
its
round
and
in
the
same
way
the
wheel
and
all
the
others
go
on
running
when
the
first
wheels
have
stopped
because
rusty
or
for
any
reason
out
of
order
is
it
not
for
a
similar
reason
that
the
stoppage
of
a
few
blood
vessels
is
not
enough
to
destroy
or
suspend
the
strength
of
the
movement
which
is
in
the
heart
as
in
the
mainspring
of
the
machine
since
on
the
contrary
the
fluids
whose
volume
is
diminished
having
a
shorter
road
to
travel
cover
the
ground
more
quickly
borne
on
as
by
a
fresh
current
which
the
energy
of
the
heart
increases
in
proportion
to
the
resistance
it
encounters
at
the
ends
of
the
and
is
not
this
the
reason
why
the
loss
of
sight
caused
by
the
compression
of
the
optic
nerve
and
by
its
ceasing
to
convey
the
images
of
objects
no
more
hinders
hearing
than
the
loss
of
hearing
caused
by
obstruction
of
the
functions
of
the
auditory
nerve
implies
the
loss
of
sight
in
the
same
way
finally
does
not
one
man
hear
except
immediately
after
his
attack
without
being
able
to
say
that
he
hears
while
another
who
hears
nothing
but
whose
lingual
nerves
are
uninjured
in
the
brain
mechanically
tells
of
all
the
dreams
which
pass
through
his
mind
these
phenomena
do
not
surprise
enlightened
physicians
at
all
they
know
what
to
think
about
man
nature
and
more
accurately
to
express
myself
in
passing
of
two
physicians
the
better
one
and
the
one
who
deserves
more
confidence
is
always
in
my
opinion
the
one
who
is
more
versed
in
the
physique
or
mechanism
of
the
human
body
and
who
leaving
aside
the
soul
and
all
the
anxieties
which
this
chimera
gives
to
fools
and
to
ignorant
men
is
seriously
occupied
only
in
pure
naturalism
therefore
let
the
pretended
charp
deride
philosophers
who
have
regarded
animals
as
machines
how
different
is
my
view
i
believe
that
descartes
would
be
a
man
in
every
way
worthy
of
respect
if
born
in
a
century
that
he
had
not
been
obliged
to
enlighten
he
had
known
the
value
of
experiment
and
observation
and
the
danger
of
cutting
loose
from
them
but
it
is
none
the
less
just
for
me
to
make
an
authentic
reparation
to
this
great
man
for
all
the
insignificant
philosophers
poor
jesters
and
poor
imitators
of
locke
who
instead
of
laughing
impudently
at
descartes
might
better
realize
that
without
him
the
field
of
philosophy
like
the
field
of
science
without
newton
might
perhaps
be
still
uncultivated
this
celebrated
philosopher
it
is
true
was
much
deceived
and
no
one
denies
that
but
at
any
rate
he
understood
animal
nature
he
was
the
first
to
prove
completely
that
animals
are
pure
machines
and
after
a
discovery
of
this
importance
demanding
so
much
sagacity
how
can
we
without
ingratitude
fail
to
pardon
all
his
errors
in
my
eyes
they
are
all
atoned
for
by
that
great
confession
for
after
all
although
he
extols
the
distinctness
of
the
two
substances
this
is
plainly
but
a
trick
of
skill
a
ruse
of
style
to
make
theologians
swallow
a
poison
hidden
in
the
shade
of
an
analogy
which
strikes
everybody
else
and
which
they
alone
fail
to
notice
for
it
is
this
this
strong
analogy
which
forces
all
scholars
and
wise
judges
to
confess
that
these
proud
and
vain
beings
more
distinguished
by
their
pride
than
by
the
name
of
men
however
much
they
may
wish
to
exalt
themselves
are
at
bottom
only
animals
and
machines
which
though
upright
go
on
all
fours
they
all
have
this
marvelous
instinct
which
is
developed
by
education
into
mind
and
which
always
has
its
seat
in
the
brain
or
for
want
of
that
when
it
is
lacking
or
hardened
in
the
medulla
oblongata
and
never
in
the
cerebellum
for
i
have
often
seen
the
cerebellum
injured
and
other
observers
have
found
it
hardened
when
the
soul
has
not
ceased
to
fulfil
its
functions
to
be
a
machine
to
feel
to
think
to
know
how
to
distinguish
good
from
bad
as
well
as
blue
from
yellow
in
a
word
to
be
born
with
an
intelligence
and
a
sure
moral
instinct
and
to
be
but
an
animal
are
therefore
characters
which
are
no
more
contradictory
than
to
be
an
ape
or
a
parrot
and
to
be
able
to
give
oneself
pleasure
i
believe
that
thought
is
so
little
incompatible
with
organized
matter
that
it
seems
to
be
one
of
its
properties
on
a
par
with
electricity
the
faculty
of
motion
impenetrability
extension
etc
do
you
ask
for
further
observations
here
are
some
which
are
incontestable
and
which
all
prove
that
man
resembles
animals
perfectly
in
his
origin
as
well
as
in
all
the
points
in
which
we
have
thought
it
essential
to
make
the
comparison
let
us
observe
man
both
in
and
out
of
his
shell
let
us
examine
young
embryos
of
four
six
eight
or
fifteen
days
with
a
microscope
after
that
time
our
eyes
are
sufficient
what
do
we
see
the
head
alone
a
little
round
egg
with
two
black
points
which
mark
the
eyes
before
that
everything
is
formless
and
one
sees
only
a
medullary
pulp
which
is
the
brain
in
which
are
formed
first
the
roots
of
the
nerves
that
is
the
principle
of
feeling
and
the
heart
which
already
within
this
substance
has
the
power
of
beating
of
itself
it
is
the
punctum
saliens
of
malpighi
which
perhaps
already
owes
a
part
of
its
excitability
to
the
influence
of
the
nerves
then
little
by
little
one
sees
the
head
lengthen
from
the
neck
which
in
dilating
forms
first
the
thorax
inside
which
the
heart
has
already
sunk
there
to
become
stationary
below
that
is
the
abdomen
which
is
divided
by
a
partition
the
diaphragm
one
of
these
enlargements
of
the
body
forms
the
arms
the
hands
the
fingers
the
nails
and
the
hair
the
other
forms
the
thighs
the
legs
the
feet
which
differ
only
in
their
observed
situation
and
which
constitute
the
support
and
the
balancing
pole
of
the
body
the
whole
process
is
a
strange
sort
of
growth
like
that
of
plants
on
the
tops
of
our
heads
is
hair
in
place
of
which
the
plants
have
leaves
and
flowers
everywhere
is
shown
the
same
luxury
of
nature
and
finally
the
directing
principle
of
plants
is
placed
where
we
have
our
soul
that
other
quintessence
of
man
such
is
the
uniformity
of
nature
which
we
are
beginning
to
realize
and
the
analogy
of
the
animal
with
the
vegetable
kingdom
of
man
with
plant
perhaps
there
even
are
animal
plants
which
in
vegetating
either
fight
as
polyps
do
or
perform
other
functions
characteristic
of
animals
we
are
veritable
moles
in
the
field
of
nature
we
achieve
little
more
than
the
mole
journey
and
it
is
our
pride
which
prescribes
limits
to
the
limitless
we
are
in
the
position
of
a
watch
that
should
say
a
writer
of
fables
would
make
the
watch
a
hero
in
a
silly
tale
i
was
never
made
by
that
fool
of
a
workman
i
who
divide
time
who
mark
so
exactly
the
course
of
the
sun
who
repeat
aloud
the
hours
which
i
mark
no
that
is
impossible
in
the
same
way
we
disdain
ungrateful
wretches
that
we
are
this
common
mother
of
all
kingdoms
as
the
chemists
say
we
imagine
or
rather
we
infer
a
cause
superior
to
that
to
which
we
owe
all
and
which
truly
has
wrought
all
things
in
an
inconceivable
fashion
no
matter
contains
nothing
base
except
to
the
vulgar
eyes
which
do
not
recognize
her
in
her
most
splendid
works
and
nature
is
no
stupid
workman
she
creates
millions
of
men
with
a
facility
and
a
pleasure
more
intense
than
the
effort
of
a
watchmaker
in
making
the
most
complicated
watch
her
power
shines
forth
equally
in
creating
the
lowliest
insect
and
in
creating
the
most
highly
developed
man
the
animal
kingdom
costs
her
no
more
than
the
vegetable
and
the
most
splendid
genius
no
more
than
a
blade
of
wheat
let
us
then
judge
by
what
we
see
of
that
which
is
hidden
from
the
curiosity
of
our
eyes
and
of
our
investigations
and
let
us
not
imagine
anything
beyond
let
us
observe
the
ape
the
beaver
the
elephant
in
their
operations
if
it
is
clear
that
these
activities
can
not
be
performed
without
intelligence
why
refuse
intelligence
to
these
animals
and
if
you
grant
them
a
soul
you
are
lost
you
fanatics
you
will
in
vain
say
that
you
assert
nothing
about
the
nature
of
the
animal
soul
and
that
you
deny
its
immortality
who
does
not
see
that
this
is
a
gratuitous
assertion
who
does
not
see
that
the
soul
of
an
animal
must
be
either
mortal
or
immortal
whichever
ours
is
and
that
it
must
therefore
undergo
the
same
fate
as
ours
whatever
that
may
be
and
that
thus
in
admitting
that
animals
have
souls
you
fall
into
scylla
in
the
effort
to
avoid
charybdis
break
the
chain
of
your
prejudices
arm
yourselves
with
the
torch
of
experience
and
you
will
render
to
nature
the
honor
she
deserves
instead
of
inferring
anything
to
her
disadvantage
from
the
ignorance
in
which
she
has
left
you
only
open
wide
your
eyes
only
disregard
what
you
can
not
understand
and
you
will
see
that
the
ploughman
whose
intelligence
and
ideas
extend
no
further
than
the
bounds
of
his
furrow
does
not
differ
essentially
from
the
greatest
genius
a
truth
which
the
dissection
of
descartes
and
of
newton
brains
would
have
proved
you
will
be
persuaded
that
the
imbecile
and
the
fool
are
animals
with
human
faces
as
the
intelligent
ape
is
a
little
man
in
another
shape
in
short
you
will
learn
that
since
everything
depends
absolutely
on
difference
of
organization
a
well
constructed
animal
which
has
studied
astronomy
can
predict
an
eclipse
as
it
can
predict
recovery
or
death
when
it
has
used
its
genius
and
its
clearness
of
vision
for
a
time
in
the
school
of
hippocrates
and
at
the
bedside
of
the
sick
by
this
line
of
observations
and
truths
we
come
to
connect
the
admirable
power
of
thought
with
matter
without
being
able
to
see
the
links
because
the
subject
of
this
attribute
is
essentially
unknown
to
us
let
us
not
say
that
every
machine
or
every
animal
perishes
altogether
or
assumes
another
form
after
death
for
we
know
absolutely
nothing
about
the
subject
on
the
other
hand
to
assert
that
an
immortal
machine
is
a
chimera
or
a
logical
fiction
is
to
reason
as
absurdly
as
caterpillars
would
reason
if
seeing
the
skins
of
their
they
should
bitterly
deplore
the
fate
of
their
species
which
to
them
would
seem
to
come
to
nothing
the
soul
of
these
insects
for
each
animal
has
his
own
is
too
limited
to
comprehend
the
metamorphoses
of
nature
never
one
of
the
most
skilful
among
them
could
have
imagined
that
it
was
destined
to
become
a
butterfly
it
is
the
same
with
us
what
more
do
we
know
of
our
destiny
than
of
our
origin
let
us
then
submit
to
an
invincible
ignorance
on
which
our
happiness
depends
he
who
so
thinks
will
be
wise
just
tranquil
about
his
fate
and
therefore
happy
he
will
await
death
without
either
fear
or
desire
and
will
cherish
life
hardly
understanding
how
disgust
can
corrupt
a
heart
in
this
place
of
many
delights
he
will
be
filled
with
reverence
gratitude
affection
and
tenderness
for
nature
in
proportion
to
his
feeling
of
the
benefits
he
has
received
from
nature
he
will
be
happy
in
short
in
feeling
nature
and
in
being
present
at
the
enchanting
spectacle
of
the
universe
and
he
will
surely
never
destroy
nature
either
in
himself
or
in
others
more
than
that
full
of
humanity
this
man
will
love
human
character
even
in
his
enemies
judge
how
he
will
treat
others
he
will
pity
the
wicked
without

they
will
be

in

the

body
he
will
none
the
less
admire
the
beauties
and
the

of
both
those
whom
nature
shall
have
favored
will
seem
to
him
to
deserve
more
respect
than
those
whom
she
has
treated
in
stepmotherly
fashion
thus
as
we
have
seen
natural
gifts
the
source
of
all
acquirements
gain
from
the
lips
and
heart
of
the
materialist
the
homage
which
every
other
thinker
unjustly
refuses
them
in
short
the
materialist
convinced
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
his
vanity
that
he
is
but
a
machine
or
an
animal
will
not
maltreat
his
kind
for
he
will
know
too
well
the
nature
of
those
actions
whose
humanity
is
always
in
proportion
to
the
degree
of
the
analogy
proved
above
between
human
beings
and
animals
and
following
the
natural
law
given
to
all
animals
he
will
not
wish
to
do
to
others
what
he
would
not
wish
them
to
do
to
him
let
us
then
conclude
boldly
that
man
is
a
machine
and
that
in
the
whole
universe
there
is
but
a
single
substance
differently
modified
this
is
no
hypothesis

forth
by

of
a
number
of

assumptions
it
is
not
the
work

of

i
should
have
disdained
a

which
i
think
to
be
so
untrustworthy
had
not
my

bearing
a
torch

to

induced
me
to
follow

experience
has
thus
spoken
to
me
in
behalf
of
reason
and
in
this
way
i
have
combined
the
two
but
it
must
have
been
noticed
that
i
have
not
allowed
myself
even
the
most
vigorous
and
immediately
deduced
reasoning
except
as
a
result
of
a
multitude
of
observations
which
no
scholar
will
contest
and
furthermore
i
recognize
only
scholars
as
judges
of
the
conclusions
which
i
draw
from
the
observations
and
i
hereby
challenge
every
prejudiced
man
who
is
neither
anatomist

with
the
only

can
here
be

chapter
ii
concerning
matter
all
philosophers
who
have
examined
attentively
the
nature
of
matter
considered
in
itself
independently
of
all
the
forms
which
constitute
bodies
have
discovered
in
this
substance
diverse
properties
proceeding
from
an
absolutely
unknown
essence
such
are
the
capacity
of
taking
on
different
forms
which
are
produced
in
matter
itself
by
which
matter
can
acquire
moving
force
and
the
faculty
of
feeling
actual
extension
which
these
philosophers
have
rightly
recognized
as
an
attribute
but
not
as
the
essence
of
matter
however
there
have
been
some
among
others
descartes
who
have
insisted
on
reducing
the
essence
of
matter
to
simple
extension
and
on
limiting
all
the
properties
of
matter
to
those
of
extension
but
this
opinion
has
been
rejected
by
all
other
modern
philosophers
so
that
the
power
of
acquiring
moving
force
and
the
faculty
of
feeling
as
well
as
that
of
extension
have
been
from
all
time
considered
as
essential
properties
of
matter
all
the
diverse
properties
that
are
observed
in
this
unknown
principle
demonstrate
a
being
in
which
these
same
properties
exist
a
being
which
must
therefore
exist
through
itself
but
we
can
not
conceive
or
rather
it
seems
impossible
that
a
being
which
exists
through
itself
should
be
able
neither
to
create
nor
to
annihilate
itself
it
is
evident
that
only
the
forms
to
which
its
essential
properties
make
it
susceptible
can
be
destroyed
and
reproduced
in
turn
thus
does
experience
force
us
to
confess
that
nothing
can
come
from
nothing
all
philosophers
who
have
not
known
the
light
of
faith
have
thought
that
this
substantial
principle
of
bodies
has
existed
and
will
exist
forever
and
that
the
elements
of
matter
have
an
indestructible
solidity
which
forbids
the
fear
that
the
world
is
going
to
fall
to
pieces
the
majority
of
christian
philosophers
also
recognize
that
the
substantial
principle
of
bodies
exists
necessarily
through
itself
and
that
the
power
of
beginning
or
ending
does
not
accord
with
its
nature
one
finds
that
this
view
is
upheld
by
an
author
of
the
last
century
who
taught
theology
in
paris
chapter
iii
concerning
the
extension
of
matter
although
we
have
no
idea
of
the
essence
of
matter
we
can
not
refuse
to
admit
the
existence
of
the
properties
which
our
senses
discover
in
it
i
open
my
eyes
and
i
see
around
me
only
matter
or
the
extended
extension
is
then
a
property
which
always
belongs
to
all
matter
which
can
belong
to
matter
alone
and
which
therefore
is
inseparable
from
the
substance
of
matter
this
property
presupposes
three
dimensions
in
the
substance
of
bodies
length
width
and
depth
truly
if
we
consult
our
knowledge
which
is
gained
entirely
from
the
senses
we
can
not
conceive
of
matter
or
the
substance
of
bodies
without
having
the
idea
of
a
being
which
is
at
the
same
time
long
broad
and
deep
because
the
idea
of
these
three
dimensions
is
necessarily
bound
up
with
our
idea
of
every
magnitude
or
quantity
those
philosophers
who
have
meditated
most
concerning
matter
do
not
understand
by
the
extension
of
this
substance
a
solid
extension
composed
of
distinct
parts
capable
of
resistance
nothing
is
united
nothing
is
divided
in
this
extension
for
there
must
be
a
force
which
separates
to
divide
and
another
force
to
unite
the
divided
parts
but
in
the
opinion
of
these
physical
philosophers
matter
has
no
actually
active
force
because
every
force
can
come
only
from
movement
or
from
some
impulse
or
tendency
toward
movement
and
they
recognize
in
matter
stripped
of
all
form
by
abstraction
only
a
potential
moving
force
this
theory
is
hard
to
conceive
but
given
its
principles
it
is
rigorously
true
in
its
consequences
it
is
one
of
those
algebraic
truths
which
is
more
readily
believed
than
conceived
by
the
mind
the
extension
of
matter
is
then
but
a
metaphysical
extension
which
according
to
the
idea
of
these
very
philosophers
presents
nothing
to
affect
our
senses
they
rightly
think
that
only
solid
extension
can
make
an
impression
on
our
senses
it
thus
seems
to
us
that
extension
is
an
attribute
which
constitutes
part
of
the
metaphysical
form
but
we
are
far
from
thinking
that
extension
constitutes
its
essence
however
before
descartes
some
of
the
ancients
made
the
essence
of
matter
consist
in
solid
extension
but
this
opinion
of
which
all
the
cartesians
have
made
much
has
at
all
times
been
victoriously
combated
by
clear
reasons
which
we
will
set
forth
later
for
order
demands
that
we
first
examine
to
what
the
properties
of
extension
can
be
reduced
chapter
concerning
the
moving
force
of
matter
the
ancients
persuaded
that
there
is
no
body
without
a
moving
force
regarded
the
substance
of
bodies
as
composed
of
two
primitive
attributes
it
was
held
that
through
one
of
these
attributes
this
substance
has
the
capacity
for
moving
and
through
the
other
the
capacity
for
being
moved
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
impossible
not
to
conceive
these
two
attributes
in
every
moving
body
namely
the
thing
which
moves
and
the
same
thing
which
is
moved
it
has
just
been
said
that
formerly
the
name
matter
was
given
to
the
substance
of
bodies
in
so
far
as
it
is
susceptible
of
being
moved
when
capable
of
moving
this
same
matter
was
known
by
the
name
of
active
principle
but
these
two
attributes
seem
to
depend
so
essentially
on
each
other
that
cicero
in
order
better
to
state
this
essential
and
primitive
union
of
matter
with
its
moving
principle
says
that
each
is
found
in
the
other
this
expresses
very
well
the
idea
of
the
ancients
from
this
it
is
clear
that
modern
writers
have
given
us
but
an
inexact
idea
of
matter
in
attempting
through
a
confusion
ill
understood
to
give
this
name
to
the
substance
of
bodies
for
once
more
matter
or
the
passive
principle
of
the
substance
of
bodies
constitutes
only
one
part
of
this
substance
thus
it
is
not
surprising
that
these
modern
thinkers
have
not
discovered
in
matter
moving
force
and
the
faculty
of
feeling
it
should
now
be
evident
at
the
first
glance
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
is
an
active
principle
it
must
have
in
the
unknown
essence
of
matter
another
source
than
extension
this
proves
that
simple
extension
fails
to
give
an
adequate
idea
of
the
complete
essence
or
metaphysical
form
of
the
substance
of
bodies
and
that
this
failure
is
due
solely
to
the
fact
that
extension
excludes
the
idea
of
any
activity
in
matter
therefore
if
we
demonstrate
this
moving
principle
if
we
show
that
matter
far
from
being
as
indifferent
as
it
is
supposed
to
be
to
movement
and
to
rest
ought
to
be
regarded
as
an
active
as
well
as
a
passive
substance
what
resource
can
be
left
to
those
who
have
made
its
essence
consist
in
extension
the
two
principles
of
which
we
have
just
spoken
extension
and
moving
force
are
then
but
potentialities
of
the
substance
of
bodies
for
in
the
same
way
in
which
this
substance
is
susceptible
of
movement
without
actually
being
moved
it
also
has
always
even
when
it
is
not
moving
itself
the
faculty
of
spontaneous
motion
the
ancients
have
rightly
noticed
that
this
moving
force
acts
in
the
substance
of
bodies
only
when
the
substance
is
manifested
in
certain
forms
they
have
also
observed
that
the
different
motions
which
it
produces
are
all
subject
to
these
different
forms
or
regulated
by
them
that
is
why
the
forms
through
which
the
substance
of
bodies
can
not
only
move
but
also
move
in
different
ways
were
called
material
forms
once
these
early
masters
had
cast
their
eyes
on
all
the
phenomena
of
nature
they
discovered
in
the
substance
of
bodies
the
power
of
in
fact
this
substance
either
moves
itself
or
when
it
is
in
motion
the
motion
is
communicated
to
it
by
another
substance
but
can
anything
be
seen
in
this
substance
save
the
substance
itself
in
action
and
if
sometimes
it
seems
to
receive
a
motion
that
it
has
not
does
it
receive
that
motion
from
any
cause
other
than
this
same
kind
of
substance
whose
parts
act
the
one
upon
the
other
if
then
one
infers
another
agent
i
ask
what
agent
and
i
demand
proofs
of
its
existence
but
since
no
one
has
the
least
idea
of
such
an
agent
it
is
not
even
a
logical
entity
therefore
it
is
clear
that
the
ancients
must
have
easily
recognized
an
intrinsic
force
of
motion
within
the
substance
of
bodies
since
in
fact
it
is
impossible
to
prove
or
conceive
any
other
substance
acting
upon
it
descartes
a
genius
made
to
blaze
new
paths
and
to
go
astray
in
them
supposed
with
some
other
philosophers
that
god
is
the
only
efficient
cause
of
motion
and
that
every
instant
he
communicates
motion
to
all
bodies
but
this
opinion
is
but
an
hypothesis
which
he
tried
to
adjust
to
the
light
of
faith
and
in
so
doing
he
was
no
longer
attempting
to
speak
as
a
philosopher
or
to
philosophers
above
all
he
was
not
addressing
those
who
can
be
convinced
only
by
the
force
of
evidence
the
christian
scholastics
of
the
last
centuries
have
felt
the
full
force
of
this
reflection
for
this
reason
they
have
wisely
limited
themselves
to
purely
philosophic
knowledge
concerning
the
motion
of
matter
although
they
might
have
shown
that
god
himself
said
that
he
had
imprinted
an
active
principle
in
the
elements
of
matter
i
is
lxvi
one
might
here
make
up
a
long
list
of
authorities
and
take
from
the
most
celebrated
professors
the
substance
of
the
doctrine
of
all
the
rest
but
it
is
clear
enough
without
a
medley
of
citations
that
matter
contains
this
moving
force
which
animates
it
and
which
is
the
immediate
cause
of
all
the
laws
of
motion
chapter
vi
concerning
the
sensitive
faculty
of
matter
we
have
spoken
of
two
essential
attributes
of
matter
upon
which
depend
the
greater
number
of
its
properties
namely
extension
and
moving
force
we
have
now
but
to
prove
a
third
attribute
i
mean
the
faculty
of
feeling
which
the
philosophers
of
all
centuries
have
found
in
this
same
substance
i
say
all
philosophers
although
i
am
not
ignorant
of
all
the
efforts
which
the
cartesians
have
made
in
vain
to
rob
matter
of
this
faculty
but
in
order
to
avoid
insurmountable
difficulties
they
have
flung
themselves
into
a
labyrinth
from
which
they
have
thought
to
escape
by
this
absurd
system
that
animals
are
pure
machines
an
opinion
so
absurd
has
never
gained
admittance
among
philosophers
except
as
the
play
of
wit
or
as
a
philosophical
pastime
for
this
reason
we
shall
not
stop
to
refute
it
experience
gives
us
no
less
proof
of
the
faculty
of
feeling
in
animals
than
of
feeling
in
men
there
comes
up
another
difficulty
which
more
nearly
concerns
our
vanity
namely
the
impossibility
of
our
conceiving
this
property
as
a
dependence
or
attribute
of
matter
let
it
not
be
forgotten
that
this
substance
reveals
to
us
only
ineffable
characters
do
we
understand
better
how
extension
is
derived
from
its
essence
how
it
can
be
moved
by
a
primitive
force
whose
action
is
exerted
without
contact
and
a
thousand
other
miracles
so
hidden
from
the
gaze
of
the
most
penetrating
eyes
that
to
paraphrase
the
idea
of
an
illustrious
modern
writer
they
reveal
only
the
curtain
which
conceals
them
but
might
not
one
suppose
as
some
have
supposed
that
the
feeling
which
is
observed
in
animated
bodies
might
belong
to
a
being
distinct
from
the
matter
of
these
bodies
to
a
substance
of
a
different
nature
united
to
them
does
the
light
of
reason
allow
us
in
good
faith
to
admit
such
conjectures
we
know
in
bodies
only
matter
and
we
observe
the
faculty
of
feeling
only
in
bodies
on
what
foundation
then
can
we
erect
an
ideal
being
disowned
by
all
our
knowledge
however
we
must
admit
with
the
same
frankness
that
we
are
ignorant
whether
matter
has
in
itself
the
faculty
of
feeling
or
only
the
power
of
acquiring
it
by
those
modifications
or
forms
to
which
matter
is
susceptible
for
it
is
true
that
this
faculty
of
feeling
appears
only
in
organic
bodies
this
is
then
another
new
faculty
which
might
exist
only
potentially
in
matter
like
all
the
others
which
have
been
mentioned
and
this
was
the
hypothesis
of
the
ancients
whose
philosophy
full
of
insight
and
penetration
deserves
to
be
raised
above
the
ruins
of
the
philosophy
of
the
moderns
it
is
in
vain
that
the
latter
disdain
the
sources
too
remote
from
them
ancient
philosophy
will
always
hold
its
own
among
those
who
are
worthy
to
judge
it
because
it
forms
at
least
in
relation
to
the
subject
of
which
i
am
treating
a
system
that
is
solid
and
well
articulated
like
the
body
whereas
all
these
scattered
members
of
modern
philosophy
form
no
system

independent
and
takes
great
pains
to
show
the
dependence
of
the
soul
on
the
body
yet
though
la
mettrie
system
may
be
opposed
to
that
of
descartes
from
one
point
of
view
from
another
point
of
view
it
seems
to
be
a
direct
consequence
of
it
la
mettrie
himself
recognizes
this
relationship
and
feels
that
his
doctrine
that
man
is
a
machine
is
a
natural
inference
from
descartes
teaching
that
animals
are
mere
machines
moreover
la
mettrie
carries
on
descartes
conception
of
the
body
as
a
machine
and
many
of
his
detailed
discussions
of
the
machinery
of
the
body
seem
to
have
been
drawn
from
descartes
it
should
be
noted
that
la
mettrie
did
justice
to
descartes
and
realized
how
much
all
philosophers
owed
to
him
he
insisted
moreover
that
descartes
errors
were
due
to
his
failure
to
follow
his
own
method
yet
la
mettrie
method
was
different
from
that
of
descartes
for
la
mettrie
was
an
empiricist
without
rationalistic
leaning
as
regards
doctrine
la
mettrie
differed
from
descartes
in
his
opinion
of
matter
since
he
disbelieved
in
any
spiritual
reality
he
gave
matter
the
attributes
of
motion
and
thought
while
descartes
insisted
that
the
one
attribute
of
matter
is
extension
it
was
a
natural
consequence
of
la
mettrie
disbelief
in
spiritual
substance
that
he
could
throw
doubt
on
the
existence
of
god
on
the
other
hand
the
belief
in
god
was
one
of
the
foundations
of
descartes
system
la
mettrie
tried
to
show
that
descartes
belief
in
a
soul
and
in
god
was
merely
designed
to
hide
his
true
thought
from
the
priests
and
to
save
himself
from
persecution
iia
the
likeness
of
la
mettrie
to
the
english
materialists
thomas
hobbes
and
john
toland
the
influence
of
descartes
upon
la
mettrie
can
not
be
questioned
but
it
is
more
difficult
to
estimate
the
influence
upon
him
of
materialistic
philosophers
hobbes
published
the
leviathan
in
and
de
corpore
in
thus
he
wrote
about
a
century
before
la
mettrie
and
since
the
eighteenth
century
was
one
in
which
the
influence
of
england
upon
france
was
very
great
it
is
easy
to
suppose
that
la
mettrie
had
read
hobbes
if
so
he
must
have
gained
many
ideas
from
him
the
extent
of
this
influence
is
however
unknown
for
la
mettrie
rarely
if
ever
quotes
from
hobbes
or
attributes
any
of
his
doctrines
to
hobbes
in
the
first
place
both
hobbes
and
la
mettrie
are
thoroughgoing
materialists
they
both
believe
that
body
is
the
only
reality
and
that
anything
spiritual
is
unimaginable
furthermore
their
conceptions
of
matter
are
very
similar
according
to
la
mettrie
matter
contains
the
faculty
of
sensation
and
the
power
of
motion
as
well
as
the
quality
of
extension
this
same
conception
of
matter
is
held
by
hobbes
for
he
specifically
attributes
extension
and
motion
to
matter
and
then
reduces
sensation
to
a
kind
of
internal
motion
thus
sensation
also
may
be
an
attribute
of
matter
moreover
hobbes
and
la
mettrie
are
in
agreement
on
many
smaller
points
and
la
mettrie
elaborates
much
that
is
suggested
in
hobbes
they
both
believe
that
the
passions
are
dependent
on
bodily
conditions
they
agree
in
the
belief
that
all
the
differences
in
men
are
due
to
differences
in
the
constitution
and
organization
of
their
bodies
they
both
discuss
the
nature
and
importance
of
language
hobbes
differs
from
la
mettrie
in
holding
that
we
can
be
sure
that
god
exists
as
the
cause
of
this
world
however
even
though
he
thinks
that
it
is
possible
to
know
that
god
exists
he
does
not
believe
that
we
can
know
his
nature
la
mettrie
system
may
be
regarded
as
the
application
of
a
system
like
that
of
hobbes
to
the
special
problem
of
the
relation
of
soul
and
body
in
man
for
if
there
is
nothing
in
the
universe
but
matter
and
motion
it
inevitably
follows
that
man
is
merely
a
very
complicated
machine
there
is
great
similarity
also
between
the
doctrine
of
la
mettrie
and
that
of
toland
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
points
of
resemblance
and
of
difference
toland
letters
to
serena
which
contain
much
of
his
philosophical
teaching
were
published
in
there
is
a
possibility
therefore
that
la
mettrie
read
them
and
gained
some
suggestions
from
them
the
point
most
emphasized
in
toland
teaching
is
that
motion
is
an
attribute
of
matter
he
argues
for
this
belief
on
the
ground
that
matter
must
be
essentially
active
in
order
to
undergo
change
and
that
the
conception
of
the
inertness
of
matter
is
based
on
the
conception
of
absolute
rest
and
that
this
absolute
rest
is
nowhere
to
be
found
since
motion
is
essential
to
matter
there
is
no
need
toland
believes
to
account
for
the
beginning
of
motion
those
who
have
regarded
matter
as
inert
have
had
to
find
some
efficient
cause
for
motion
and
to
do
this
they
have
held
that
all
nature
is
animated
but
this
pretended
animation
is
utterly
useless
since
matter
is
itself
endowed
with
motion
the
likeness
to
la
mettrie
is
evident
la
mettrie
likewise
opposes
the
doctrine
of
the
animation
of
matter
and
the
belief
in
any
external
cause
of
motion
yet
he
feels
the
need
of
postulating
some
beginning
of
motion
and
although
he
uses
the
conception
so
freely
he
does
not
agree
with
toland
that
the
nature
of
motion
is
known
he
believes
that
it
is
impossible
to
know
the
nature
of
motion
while
toland
believes
that
the
nature
of
motion
is
another
point
of
contrast
between
toland
and
la
mettrie
is
in
their
doctrines
of
god
toland
believes
that
god
a
pure
spirit
or
immaterial
being
is
necessary
for
his
system
while
la
mettrie
questions
god
existence
and
insists
that
immateriality
and
spirituality
are
fine
words
that
no
one
understands
it
must
be
admitted
in
truth
that
la
mettrie
and
toland
have
different
interests
and
different
points
of
view
toland
is
concerned
to
discover
the
essential
nature
of
matter
while
la
mettrie
problem
is
to
find
the
specific
relation
of
body
and
mind
on
this
relation
he
builds
his
whole
system
b
the
relation
of
la
mettrie
to
an
english
sensationalist
john
locke
locke
essay
concerning
human
understanding
was
published
in
and
la
mettrie
like
most
cultured
frenchmen
of
the
enlightenment
was
influenced
by
his
teaching
the
main
agreement
between
locke
and
la
mettrie
is
in
their
doctrine
that
all
ideas
are
derived
from
sensation
both
vigorously
oppose
the
belief
in
innate
ideas
teaching
that
even
our
most
complex
and
our
most
abstract
ideas
are
gained
through
sensation
but
la
mettrie
does
not
follow
locke
in
analyzing
these
ideas
and
in
concluding
that
many
sensible
qualities
of
objects
such
as
colors
sounds
have
no
existence
outside
the
mind
he
rejects
locke
doctrine
of
spiritual
substances
and
opposes
locke
theistic
teaching
laying
stress
on
the
other
hand
upon
locke
admission
of
the
possibility
that
thinking
being
may
also
be
material
iiia
the
likeness
probable
but
unacknowledged
to
la
mettrie
of
the
french
sensationalists
etienne
bonnot
de
condillac
and
claude
adrien
helvetius
condillac
trait√©
des
sensations
was
published
about
ten
years
after
la
mettrie
naturelle
de
and
therefore
it
is
probable
that
condillac
had
read
this
work
and
gained
some
ideas
from
it
yet
condillac
never
mentions
la
mettrie
name
nor
cites
his
doctrines
this
omission
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
works
of
la
mettrie
had
been
so
condemned
that
later
philosophers
wished
to
conceal
the
similarity
of
their
doctrines
to
his
whether
the
sensationalists
were
influenced
by
his
teachings
or
not
there
is
such
a
profound
likeness
in
their
teachings
that
la
mettrie
may
well
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
first
french
sensationalists
as
well
as
one
of
the
leading
french
materialists
of
the
time
condillac
and
la
mettrie
agree
that
experience
is
the
source
of
all
knowledge
as
lange
suggests
la
mettrie
development
of
reason
from
the
imagination
may
have
suggested
to
condillac
the
way
to
develop
all
the
faculties
from
the
soul
la
mettrie
asserts
that
reason
is
but
the
sensitive
soul
contemplating
its
ideas
and
that
imagination
plays
all
the
r√¥les
of
the
soul
while
condillac
elaborates
the
same
idea
and
shows
in
great
detail
how
all
the
faculties
of
the
soul
are
but
modifications
of
sensation
both
la
mettrie
and
condillac
believe
that
there
is
no
gulf
between
man
and
the
lower
animals
but
this
leads
to
a
point
of
disagreement
between
the
two
philosophers
for
condillac
absolutely
denies
that
animals
can
be
mere
machines
and
we
must
suppose
that
he
would
the
more
ardently
oppose
the
teaching
that
man
is
merely
a
complicated
machine
condillac
finally
unlike
la
mettrie
believes
in
the
existence
of
god
a
final
point
of
contrast
also
concerns
the
theology
of
the
two
writers
la
mettrie
insists
that
we
can
not
be
sure
that
there
is
any
purpose
in
the
world
while
condillac
affirms
that
we
can
discern
intelligence
and
design
throughout
the
universe
like
la
mettrie
and
condillac
helvetius
teaches
that
all
the
faculties
of
the
mind
can
be
reduced
to
sensation
unlike
la
mettrie
he
specifically
distinguishes
the
mind
from
the
soul
and
describes
the
mind
as
a
later
developed
product
of
the
soul
or
faculty
of
sensation
this
idea
may
have
been
suggested
by
la
statement
that
reason
is
a
modification
of
sensation
helvetius
however
unlike
la
mettrie
does
not
clearly
decide
that
sensation
is
but
a
result
of
bodily
conditions
and
he
admits
that
sensation
may
be
a
modification
of
a
spiritual
substance
moreover
he
claims
that
climate
and
food
have
no
effect
on
the
mind
and
that
the
superiority
of
the
understanding
is
not
dependent
on
the
strength
of
the
body
and
its
organs
la
mettrie
and
helvetius
resemble
each
other
in
ethical
doctrine
both
make
pleasure
and
pain
the
ruling
motives
of
man
conduct
they
claim
that
all
the
emotions
are
merely
modifications
of
corporeal
pleasure
and
pain
and
that
therefore
the
only
principle
of
action
in
man
is
the
desire
for
pleasure
and
the
fear
of
pain
b
the
likeness
to
la
mettrie
of
the
french
materialist
baron
paul
heinrich
dietrich
von
holbach
as
condillac
and
helvetius
emphasize
the
sensationalism
taught
by
la
mettrie
so
holbach
book
is
a
reiteration
and
elaboration
of
the
materialism
set
forth
in
la
mettrie
works
the
teaching
of
holbach
is
so
like
that
of
la
mettrie
that
the
similarity
can
hardly
be
a
coincidence
la
mettrie
regards
experience
as
the
only
teacher
holbach
dwells
on
this
same
idea
and
insists
that
experience
is
our
only
source
of
knowledge
in
all
matters
holbach
likewise
teaches
that
man
is
a
purely
material
being
he
disbelieves
in
any
spiritual
reality
whatsoever
and
makes
matter
the
only
substance
in
the
world
he
lays
stress
also
on
one
thought
which
is
a
natural
consequence
of
la
mettrie
teaching
la
mettrie
has
limited
the
action
of
the
will
and
has
insisted
that
the
will
is
dependent
on
bodily
conditions
holbach
goes
further
and
declares
repeatedly
that
all
freedom
is
a
delusion
and
that
man
is
controlled
in
every
action
by
rigid
necessity
this
teaching
seems
to
be
the
natural
outcome
of
the
belief
that
man
is
a
machine
holbach
atheistic
theology
is
more
extreme
than
his
predecessor
for
la
mettrie
admits
that
god
may
exist
while
holbach
vigorously
opposes
the
possibility
moreover
holbach
holds
the
opinion
barely
suggested
by
la
mettrie
that
an
atheistic
doctrine
would
ameliorate
the
condition
of
mankind
he
insists
that
the
idea
of
god
has
hindered
the
progress
of
reason
and
interfered
with
natural
law
holbach
is
indeed
the
only
one
of
the
philosophers
here
discussed
who
frankly
adopts
a
fatalistic
and
atheistic
doctrine
of
the
universe
in
these
respects

notes
on

a

matter
may
well
be
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
thought
although
la
mettrie
attempts
to
avoid
this
reef
by
refraining
from
the
use
of
these
words
yet
he
asserts
throughout
his
work
that
sensations
consciousness
and
the
soul
itself
are
modifications
of
matter
and
motion
the
possibility
of
matter
being
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
thought
is
denied
by
elie
luzac
the
publisher
of
machine
in
his
work
plus
que
machine
in
this
work
he
tries
to
disprove
the
conclusions
of
machine
he
says
we
have
therefore
proved
by
the
idea
of
the
inert
state
of
matter
by
that
of
motion
by
that
of
relations
by
that
of
activity
by
that
of
extension
that
matter
can
not
be
possessed
of
the
faculty
of
thinking
to
be
brief
i
say
that
if
by
a
material
substance
we
understand
that
matter
which
falls
under
the
cognizance
of
our
senses
and
which
is
endowed
with
the
qualities
we
have
mentioned
the
soul
can
not
be
material
so
that
it
must
be
immaterial
and
for
the
same
reason
god
could
not
have
given
the
faculty
of
thinking
to
matter
since
he
can
not
perform
contradictions
how
can
we
define
a
being
whose
nature
is
absolutely
unknown
to
us
la
mettrie
uses
this
as
an
argument
against
the
belief
in
a
soul
and
yet
he
later
admits
that
the
nature
of
motion
is
as
unknown
to
us
as
the
nature
of
matter
it
is
difficult
then
to
see
why
there
is
more
reason
to
doubt
the
existence
of
spirit
than
to
doubt
the
existence
of
matter
locke
makes
this
point
very
well
it
is
for
want
of
reflection
that
we
are
apt
to
think
that
our
senses
show
us
nothing
but
material
things
every
act
of
sensation
when
duly
considered
gives
us
an
equal
view
of
both
parts
of
nature
the
corporeal
and
spiritual

we
have
to

made
his
most
famous
discovery
he
found
that
the
height
to
which
a
liquid
will
rise
in
a
closed
tube
depends
on
the
specific
gravity
of
the
liquid
and
concludes
from
this
that
the
column
of
liquid
is
sustained
by
atmospheric
pressure
this
discovery
did
away
with

obscure
idea
of

and
laid
bare
the
principle
on
which
mercurial
barometers
are
constructed
for

time
the
mercurial
thermometer
was
called

the

which
the

includes
is
still
known
as

torricellian
vacuum
only

luzac
says
is
true
that
if
the
materiality
of
the
soul
was
proved
the
knowledge
of
her
would
be
an
object
of
natural
philosophy
and
we
might
with
some
appearance
of
reason
reject
all
arguments
to
the
contrary
which
are
not
drawn
from
that
science
but
if
the
soul
is
not
material
the
investigation
of
its
nature
does
not
belong
to
natural
philosophy
but
to
those
who
search
into
the
nature
of
its
faculties
and
are
called
metaphysicians
man
is
a
machine
this
is
the
first
clear
statement
of
this
theory
which
as
the
title
of
the
work
indicates
is
the
central
doctrine
of
this
work
descartes
had
strongly
denied
the
possibility
of
conceiving
man
as
a
machine
we
may
easily
conceive
a
machine
to
be
so
constructed
that
it
emits
vocables
and
even
that
it
emits
some
correspondent
to
the
action
upon
it
of
external
objects
which
cause
a
change
in
its
organs
but
not
that
it
should
emit
them
variously
so
as
appositely
to
reply
to
what
is
said
in
its
presence
as
men
of
the
lowest
grade
of
intellect
can
do
let
us
then
take
in
our
hands
the
staff
of
experience
la
mettrie
repeatedly
emphasizes
the
belief
that
knowledge
must
come
from
experience
moreover
he
confines
this
experience
to
sense
experience
and
concludes
naturelle
de
with
these
words
no
senses
no
ideas
the
fewer
senses
there
are
the
fewer
ideas
no
sensations
experienced
no
ideas
these
principles
are
the
necessary
consequence
of
all
the
observations
and
experiences
that
constitute
the
unassailable
foundation
of
this
work
this
doctrine
is
opposed
to
the
teaching
of
descartes
who
insists
that
neither
our
imagination
nor
our
senses
can
give
us
assurance
of
anything
unless
our
understanding
intervene
moreover
descartes
believes
that
the
senses
are
fallacious
and
that
the
ideal
method
for
philosophy
is
a
method
corresponding
to
that
of
mathematics
condillac
and
holbach
agree
with
la
mettrie
opinion
thus
condillac
teaches
that
man
is
nothing
more
than
what
he
has
become
by
the
use
of
his
senses
and
holbach
says
as
soon
as
we
take
leave
of
experience
we
fall
into
the
chasm
where
our
imagination
leads
us
astray

hippocrates
is
often
termed
the
father
of
medicine
he
was
born
in

in
he
studied
medicine
under
his
father
heraclides
and
herodicus
of
selymbria
and
philosophy
under
gorgias
and
democritus
he
was
the
first
to
separate
medicine
from
religion
and
from
philosophy
he
insisted
that
diseases
must
be
treated
by
the
physician
as
if
they
were
governed
by
purely
natural
laws
the
greeks
had
such
respect
for
dead
bodies
that
hippocrates
could
not
have
dissected
a
human
body
and
consequently
his
knowledge
of
its
structure
was
limited
but
he
seems
to
have
been
an
acute
and
skilful
observer
of
conditions
in
the
living
body
he
wrote
several
works
on
medicine
and
in
one
of
them
showed
the
first
principles
on
which
the
public
health
must
be
based
the
details
of
his
life
are
hidden
by
tradition
but
it
is
certain
that
he
was
regarded
with
great
respect
and
veneration
by
the
greeks
the
different
combinations
of
these
humors
compare
this
with
descartes
statement
that
the
difference
in
men
comes
from
the
difference
in
the
construction
and
position
of
the
brain
which
causes
a
difference
in
the
action
of
the
animal

this
drug
intoxicates
like

each
in

measure
and
according
to
the
dose
descartes
also
speaks
of
the
effect
of
wine
the
vapors
of
wine
entering
the
blood
quickly
go
from
the
heart
to
the
brain
where
they
are
converted
into
spirits
which
being
stronger
and
more
abundant
than
usual
are
capable
of

akakia
luzac
sums
up
the
preceding
facts
by
saying
here
are
a
great
many
facts
but
what
is
it
they
prove
only
that
the
faculties
of
the
soul
arise
grow
and
acquire
strength
in
proportion
as
the
body
does
so
that
these
same
faculties
are
weakened
in
the
same
proportion
as
the
body
is
but
from
all
these
circumstances
it
does
not
follow
that
the
faculty
of
thinking
is
an
attribute
of
matter
and
that
all
depends
on
the
manner
in
which
our
machine
is
made
that
the
faculties
of
the
soul
arise
from
a
principle
of
animal
life
from
an
innate
heat
or
force
from
an
irritability
of
the
finest
parts
of
the
body
from
a
subtil
ethereal
matter
diffused
through
it
or
in
a
word
from
all
these
things
taken
together
the
diverse
states
of
the
soul
are
therefore
always
correlative
with
those
of
the
body
this
view
is
in
diametrical
opposition
to
the
teaching
of
descartes
who
says
the
soul
is
of
a
nature
wholly
independent
of
the
body
yet
descartes
also
states
that
there
is
an
intimate
connection
between
the
two
the
reasonable
soul
could
by
no
means
be
educed
from
the
power
of
matter
it
must
be
expressly
created
and
it
is
not
sufficient
that
it
be
lodged
in
the
human
body
exactly
like
a
pilot
in
a
ship
unless
perhaps
to
move
its
members
but
it
is
necessary
for
it
to
be
joined
and
united
more
closely
to
the
body
in
order
to
have
sensations
and
appetites
similar
to
ours
and
thus
constitute
a
real
man
holbach
later
emphasizes
this
close
connection
between
body
and
soul
which
is
so
insisted
upon
by
la
mettrie
if
freed
from
our
prejudices
we
wish
to
see
our
soul
or
the
moving
principle
which
acts
in
us
we
shall
remain
convinced
that
it
is
part
of
our
body
that
it
can
not
be
distinguished
from
the
body
except
by
an
abstraction
that
it
is
but
the
body
itself
considered
relatively
to
some
of
the
functions
or
faculties
to
which
its
nature
and
particular
organization
make
it
susceptible
we
shall
see
that
this
soul
is
forced
to
undergo
the
same
changes
as
the
body
that
it
grows
and
develops
with
the
body
finally
we
can
not
help
recognizing
that
at
some
periods
it
shows
evident
signs
of
weakness

devoted
most
of

he
taught

by
attracting
their

to
the
motion

while
he
was
speaking
and
by
persuading
them
to
imitate
these
motions
in
this
way
they
finally
learned
to
articulate

to

his

was

he
died

proves
to

with

statement
of

the
most
noble
and

invention
of

was
that
of

consisting
of

one
studies
all
the
intellectual
faculties
the
more
convinced
one
remains
that
they
are
all
included
in
the
faculty
of
sensation
upon
which
they
all
depend
so
essentially
that
without
it
the
soul
could
never
perform
any
of
its
functions
this
resembles
condillac
doctrine
of
sensation
judgment
reflexion
desires
passions
are
nothing
but
sensation
itself
which
is
transformed
in
diverse
ways
helvetius
also
says
all
the
operations
of
the
mind
are
reducible

hobbes

men
may
put

luzac
says
this
no
more
proves
that
organization
is
the
chief
merit
of
man
than
that
the
form
of
a
musical
instrument
constitutes
the
chief
merit
of
the
musician
in
proportion
to
the
goodness
of
the

the

charms

and
the
case
is
the
same
with
the
soul
in

to
the

of
the

the

is
in
better
condition
to
exert
her
faculties
such
is
i
think
the

luzac
argues
against
this
statement
thus
but
if
thought
and
all
the
faculties
of
the
soul
depended
only
on
the
organization
as
some
pretend
how
could
the
imagination
draw

long
chain
of
consequences
from
the
objects
it

embraced

pierre
bayle
was
born
at
carlat
in
although
the
child
of
protestant
parents
he
was
converted
by
the
jesuits
after
his
reconversion
to
protestantism
he
was
driven
out
of
france
and
took
refuge
first
in
geneva
and
then
in
holland
in
he
became
professor
of
philosophy
at
the
protestant
college
of
sedan
and
in
professor
of
philosophy
and
history
at
rotterdam
in
he
was
forced
to
resign
from
his
position
on
account
of
his
religious
views
bayle
was
one
of
the
leading
french
sceptics
of
the
time
he
was
a
cartesian
but
questioned
both
the
certainty
of
one
own
existence
and
the
knowledge
derived
from
it
he
declared
that
religion
is
contrary
to
the
human
reason
but
that
this
fact
does
not
necessarily
destroy
faith
he
distinguished
religion
not
only
from
science
but
also
from
morality
and
vigorously
opposed
those
who
considered
a
certain
religion
necessary
for
morality
he
did
not
openly
attack
christianity
yet
all
that
he
wrote
awakened
doubt
and
his
work
exerted
an
extensive
influence
for
scepticism
his
principal
work
is
the
dictionnaire
historique
et
critique
published
and
containing
a
vast
amount
of
knowledge
expressed
in
a
piquant
and
popular
style
this
fact
made
the
book
widely
read
both
by
scholars
and
by
superficial
readers
arnobius
the
elder
was
born
at
sicca
venerea
in
numidia
in
the
latter
part
of
the
third
century
he
was
at
first
an
opponent
of
christianity
but
was
afterwards
converted
and
wrote
adversus
gentes
as
an
apology
for
christianity
in
this
work
he
tries
to
answer
the
complaints
made
against
christians
on
the
ground
that
the
disasters
of
the
time
were
due
to
their
impiety
vindicates
the
divinity
of
christ
and
discusses
the
nature
of
the
human
soul
he
concludes
that
the
soul
is
not
immortal
for
he
believes
that
the
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
would
have
a
deteriorating
influence
on
morality
for
translation
of
his
work
compare
vol
xix
of
the
christian
library
there
exists
no
soul
or
sensitive
substance
without
remorse
condillac
had
said
there
is
something
in
animals
besides
motion
they
are
not
pure
machines
they
feel
la
mettrie
also
attributed
remorse
to
animals
but
believed
that
they
are
none
the
less
machines
luzac
said
in
comment
what
renders
these
systems
completely
ridiculous
is
that
the
persons
who
pronounce
men
machines
give
them
properties
which
belie
their
assertion
if
beings
are
but
machines
why
do
they
grant
a
natural
law
an
internal
sense
a
kind
of
dread
these
are
ideas
which
can
not
be
excited
by
objects
which
operate
on
our
senses
nature
has
created
us
solely
to
be
happy
this
is
a
statement
of
the
doctrine
which
la
mettrie
develops
in
his
principal
ethical
work
discours
sur
le
bonheur
he
teaches
that
happiness
rests
upon
bodily
pleasure
and
pain
in
naturelle
de
la
mettrie
states
that
all
the
passions
can
be
developed
from
two
fundamental
passions
of
which
they
are
but
modifications
love
and
hatred
or
desire
and
aversion
like
la
mettrie
helvetius
makes
corporeal
pleasure
and
pain
the
ruling
motives
for
man
conduct
thus
he
writes
pleasure
and
pain
are
and
always
will
be
the
only
principles
of
action
in
man
remorse
is
nothing
more
than
a
foresight
of
bodily
pain
to
which
some
crime
has
exposed
us
he
definitely
makes
happiness
the
end
of
human
action
the
end
of
man
is
and
the
attainment
of
a
happy
existence
man
to
find
happiness
should
save
up
his
pleasures
and
refuse
all
those
which
might
change
into
pains
the
passions
always
have
happiness
as
an
object
they
are
legitimate
and
natural
and
can
not
be
called
good
or
bad
except
on
account
of
their
influence
on
human
beings
to
lead
men
to
virtue
we
must
show
them
the
advantages
of
virtuous
actions
holbach
finally
goes
further
than
la
mettrie
or
helvetius
and
makes
purely
mechanical
impulses
the
motives
of
man
action
the
passions
are
ways
of
being
or
modifications
of
the
internal
organs
attracted
or
repulsed
by
objects
and
are
consequently
subject
in
their
own
way
to
the
physical
laws
of
attraction
and
repulsion

he
was
continually
scourged
while
bound

and
forced
to
cry
benefactors
should
be
honored
who
can
be
sure
that
the
reason
for
man
existence
is
not
simply
the
fact
that
he
exists
luzac
opposes
this
by
saying
if
the
reason
of
man
existence
was
in
man
himself
this
existence
would
be
a
necessary
consequence
of
his
own
nature
so
that
his
own
nature
would
contain
the
cause
or
reason
of
his
existence
now
since
his
own
nature
would
imply
the
cause
of
his
existence
it
would
also
imply
his
existence
itself
so
that
man
could
no
more
be
considered
as
than
a
circle
can
be
considered
without
radii
or
a
picture
without
features
or
proportions
if
the
existence
of
man
was
in
man
himself
he
would
then
be
an
invariable
being

deism
is
a
system
of
thought
which
arose
in
the
latter
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
its
most
important
representatives
in
england
were
toland
collins
chubb
shaftsbury
and
tindal
they
insisted
on
freedom
of
thought
and
speech
and
claimed
that
reason
is
superior
to
any
authority
they
denied
the
necessity
of
any
supernatural
revelation
and
were
consequently
vigorously
opposed
by
the
church
partly
because
of
this
opposition
by
the
church
many
of
them
argued
against
christianity
and
tried
to
show
that
an
observance
of
moral
laws
is
the
only
religion
necessary
for
man
they
taught
that
happiness
is
man
chief
end
and
that
since
man
is
a
social
being
his
happiness
can
best
be
gained
by
mutual
helpfulness
although
they
declared
that
nature
is
the
work
of
a
perfect
being
they
had
a
mechanical
conception
of
the
relation
of
god
to
the
world
and
did
not
like
later
theists
find
evidence
of
god

and
was
enthusiastic
in

support

in

he
tries
to
show
that
the
discoveries
of
natural
science
are
the
strongest
proofs
for
the
existence
of

the
wonders
of

are
enough
to
destroy

opposes

he
also
opposes

claims
that

we
shut

because
the
machinery

so
composed
that
the
movement
of
this
hand
towards

excites
another
movement
in

controls
the

tried

apply
mathematics
to
medicine
in
the
same
way
in
which
it
had
been
applied
to

physical
sciences
he
was
wise
enough
to
restrict
the
application
of
his
system
to
the
motion
of
the
muscles
but
his
followers
tried
to
extend
its
application
and
were
led
into
many
absurd
conjectures
borelli
was
at
first
professor
of
mathematics
at
pisa
and
later
professor
of

at

order
that
the

gives
it
bows
a
hundred
times
to
the
yoke
descartes
on
the
other
hand
teaches
that
the
soul
has
direct
control
over
its
voluntary
actions
and
thoughts
and
indirect
control
over
its
passions
la
mettrie
goes
further
than
to
limit
the
extent
of
the
will
and
questions
whether
it
is
ever
free
the
sensations
which
affect
us
decide
the
soul
either
to
will
or
not
to
will
to
love
or
to
hate
these
sensations
according
to
the
pleasure
or
the
pain
which
they
cause
in
us
this
state
of
the
soul
thus
determined
by
its
sensations
is
called
the
will
holbach
insists
on
this
point
and
contends
that
all
freedom
is
a
delusion
man
birth
depends
on
causes
entirely
outside
of
his
power
it
is
without
his
permission
that
he
enters
this
system
where
he
has
a
place
and
without
his
consent
that
from
the
moment
of
his
birth
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
is
continually
modified
by
causes
that
influence
his
machine
in
spite
of
his
will
modify
his
being
and
alter
his
conduct
is
not
the
least
reflexion
enough
to
prove
that
the
solids
and
fluids
of
which
the
body
is
composed
and
that
the
hidden
mechanism
that
he
considers
independent
of
external
causes
are
perpetually
under
the
influence
of
these
causes
and
could
not
act
without
them
does
he
not
see
that
his
temperament
does
not
depend
on
himself
that
his
passions
are
the
necessary
consequences
of
his
temperament
that
his
will
and
his
actions
are
determined
by
these
same
passions
and
by
ideas
that
he
has
not
given
to
himself
in
a
word
everything
should
convince
man
that
during
every
moment
of
his
life
he
is
but
a
passive
instrument
in
the
hands
of
necessity
the
theory
of
animal
spirits
held
by
galen
and
elaborated
by
descartes
is
that
the
nerves
are
hollow
tubes
containing
a
volatile
liquid
the
animal
spirits
the
animal
spirits
were
supposed
to
circulate
from
the
periphery
to
the
brain
and
back
again
and
to
perform
by
their
action
all
the
functions
of
the
nerves
berkeley
uses
the
fact
that
the
color
of
objects
varies
as
one
argument
for
his
idealistic
conclusion
it
is
hard
to
tell
what
pythagoras
himself
taught
but
it
is
certain
that
he
taught
the
kinship
of
animals
and
men
and
upon
this
kinship
his
rule
for
the
abstinence
from
flesh
was
probably
based
among
the
writings
of
the
later
pythagoreans
we
find
strange
rules
for
diet
which
are
plainly
genuine
taboos
for
example
they
are
commanded
to
abstain
from
beans
not
to
break
bread
not
to
eat
from
a
whole
loaf
not
to
eat
the
heart
etc
plato
forbade
the
use
of
wine
in
his
ideal
republic
nature
first
care
when
the
chyle
enters
the
blood
is
to
excite
in
it
a
kind
of
fever
thus
warmth
is
the
first
necessity
for
the
body
compare
with
this
descartes
statement
there
is
a
continual
warmth
in
our
heart
this
fire
is
the
bodily
principle
of
all
the
movements
of
our
members
this
is
one
of
the
many
instances
in

of
the
mechanism
of
the

is
similar
to
that

understood
animal
nature
he
was
the
first
to
prove
completely
that
animals
are
pure
machines
contrast
this
with
la
mettrie
former
reference
in
naturelle
de
to
this
absurd
system
animals
are
pure
machines
such
a
laughable
opinion
he
adds
has
never
gained
admittance
among
philosophers
experience
does
not
prove
the
faculty
of
feeling
any
less
in
animals
than
in
men
it
is
evident
that
la
opposition
to
this
system
was
based
upon
his
insistence
on
the
similarity
of
men
and
animals
in
machine
he
argues
from
the
same
premiss
that
animals
are
machines
that
men
are
like
animals
and
that
therefore
men
also
are
machines
notes

de
matter
according
to
la
mettrie
is
endowed
with
extensity
the
power
of
movement
and
the
faculty
of
sensation
as
la
mettrie
says
this
conception
was
not
held
by
descartes
who
thought
that
the
essential
attribute
of
matter
is
extension
the
nature
of
body
consists
not
in
weight
hardness
color
and
the
like
but
in
extension
alone
in
its
being
a
substance
extended
in
length
breadth
and
height
hobbes
conception
of
matter
is
very
similar
to
that
of
la
mettrie
he
specifically
attributes
motion
to
matter
motion
and
magnitude
are
the
most
common
accidents
of
all
bodies
he
does
not
name
sensation
as
an
attribute
of
matter
but
he
reduces
sensation
to
motion
sense
is
some
internal
motion
in
the
sentient
since
motion
is
one
of
the
attributes
of
matter
and
since
matter
is
the
only
reality
in
the
universe
sensation
must
be
attributed
to
matter
la
mettrie
always
insists
that
matter
has
the
power
of
moving
itself
and
resents
any
attempt
to
show
that
the
motion
is
due
to
an
outside
agent
in
this
opinion
he
is
in
agreement
with
toland
toland
says
that
those
who
have
regarded
matter
as
inert
have
had
to
find
some
efficient
cause
for
motion
and
to
do
this
they
have
held
that
all
nature
is
animated
this
pretended
animation
however
is
utterly
useless
since
matter
is
itself
endowed
with
motion
this
absurd
system
that
animals
are
pure
machines
