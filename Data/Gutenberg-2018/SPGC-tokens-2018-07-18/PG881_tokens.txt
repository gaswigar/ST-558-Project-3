new
monthly
magazine
the
two
months
i
spent
at
newport
with
aunt
eliza
huell
who
had
been
ordered
to
the
for
the
benefit
of
her
health
were
the
months
that
created
all
that
is
dramatic
in
my
destiny
my
aunt
was
troublesome
for
she
was
not
only
out
of
health
but
in
a
lawsuit
she
wrote
to
me
for
we
lived
apart
asking
me
to
accompany
her
not
because
she
was
fond
of
me
or
wished
to
give
me
pleasure
but
because
i
was
useful
in
various
ways
mother
insisted
upon
my
accepting
her
invitation
not
because
she
loved
her
late
husband
sister
but
because
she
thought
it
wise
to
cotton
to
her
in
every
particular
for
aunt
eliza
was
rich
and
we
two
lone
women
were
poor
i
gave
my
a
longer
and
earlier
vacation
than
usual
took
a
week
to
arrange
my
wardrobe
for
i
made
my
own
dresses
and
then
started
for
new
york
with
the
five
dollars
which
aunt
eliza
had
sent
for
my
fare
thither
i
arrived
at
her
house
in
bond
street
at
and
found
her
man
james
in
conversation
with
the
milkman
he
informed
me
that
miss
huell
was
very
bad
and
that
the
housekeeper
was
still
in
bed
i
supposed
that
aunt
eliza
was
in
bed
also
but
i
had
hardly
entered
the
house
when
i
heard
her
bell
ring
as
she
only
could
ring
it
with
an
impatient
jerk
she
wants
hot
milk
said
james
and
the
man
has
just
come
i
laid
my
bonnet
down
and
went
to
the
kitchen
saluting
the
cook
who
was
an
old
acquaintance
and
who
told
me
that
the
divil
had
been
in
the
range
that
morning
i
took
a
pan
into
which
i
poured
some
milk
and
held
it
over
the
gaslight
till
it
was
hot
then
i
carried
it
up
to
aunt
eliza
here
is
your
milk
aunt
eliza
you
have
sent
for
me
to
help
you
and
i
begin
with
the
earliest
opportunity
i
looked
for
you
an
hour
ago
ring
the
bell
i
rang
it
your
mother
is
well
i
suppose
she
would
have
sent
you
though
had
she
been
sick
in
bed
she
has
done
so
she
thinks
better
of
my
coming
than
i
do
the
housekeeper
mrs
roll
came
in
and
aunt
eliza
politely
requested
her
to
have
breakfast
for
her
niece
as
soon
as
possible
i
do
not
go
down
of
mornings
yet
said
aunt
eliza
but
mrs
roll
presides
see
that
the
coffee
is
good
roll
it
is
good
generally
miss
huell
you
see
that
margaret
brought
me
my
milk
ahem
said
mrs
roll
marching
out
at
the
beginning
of
each
visit
to
aunt
eliza
i
was
in
the
habit
of
dwelling
on
the
contrast
between
her
way
of
living
and
ours
we
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
every
thing
about
her
wore
a
hereditary
air
for
she
lived
in
my
grandfather
house
and
it
was
the
same
as
in
his
day
if
i
was
at
home
when
these
contrasts
occurred
to
me
i
should
have
felt
angry
as
it
was
i
felt
them
as
in
a
dream
the
china
the
silver
the
old
furniture
and
the
excellent
fare
soothed
me
in
the
middle
of
the
day
aunt
eliza
came
down
stairs
and
after
she
had
received
a
visit
from
her
doctor
decided
to
go
to
newport
on
saturday
it
was
wednesday
and
i
could
if
i
chose
make
any
addition
to
my
wardrobe
i
had
none
to
make
i
informed
her
what
were
my
dresses
had
i
a
black
silk
she
asked
i
had
no
black
silk
and
thought
one
would
be
unnecessary
for
hot
weather
who
ever
heard
of
a
girl
of
having
no
black
silk
you
have
slimsy
muslins
i
dare
say
yes
and
you
like
them
for
present
wear
that
afternoon
she
sent
mrs
roll
out
who
returned
with
a
splendid
heavy
silk
for
me
which
aunt
eliza
said
should
be
made
before
saturday
and
it
was
i
went
to
a
fashionable
of
her
recommending
and
on
friday
it
came
home
beautifully
made
and
trimmed
with
real
lace
even
the
pushers
could
find
no
fault
with
this
said
aunt
eliza
turning
over
the
sleeves
and
smoothing
the
lace
somehow
she
smuggled
into
the
house
a
white
with
white
roses
also
a
handsome
mantilla
she
held
the
bonnet
before
me
with
a
nod
and
deposited
it
again
in
the
box
which
made
a
part
of
the
luggage
for
newport
on
sunday
morning
we
arrived
in
newport
and
went
to
a
quiet
hotel
in
the
town
james
was
with
us
but
mrs
roll
was
left
in
bond
street
in
charge
of
the
household
monday
was
spent
in
an
endeavor
to
make
an
arrangement
regarding
the
hire
of
a
coach
and
coachman
several
keepers
were
in
attendance
but
nothing
was
settled
till
i
suggested
that
aunt
eliza
should
send
for
her
own
carriage
james
was
sent
back
the
next
day
and
returned
on
thursday
with
coach
horses
and
william
her
coachman
that
matter
being
finished
and
the
trunks
being
unpacked
she
decided
to
take
her
first
bath
in
the
sea
expecting
me
to
support
her
through
the
trying
ordeal
of
the
surf
as
we
were
returning
from
the
beach
we
met
a
carriage
containing
a
number
of
persons
with
a
family
resemblance
when
aunt
eliza
saw
them
she
angrily
exclaimed
am
i
to
see
those
uxbridges
every
day
of
the
uxbridges
this
much
i
knew
that
the
two
brothers
uxbridge
were
the
lawyers
of
her
opponents
in
the
lawsuit
which
had
existed
three
or
four
years
i
had
never
felt
any
interest
in
it
though
i
knew
that
it
was
concerning
a
tract
of
ground
in
the
city
which
had
belonged
to
my
grandfather
and
which
had
since
his
day
become
very
valuable
litigation
was
a
habit
of
the
huell
family
so
the
sight
of
the
uxbridge
family
did
not
agitate
me
as
it
did
aunt
eliza
the
sly
methodical
dogs
but
i
shall
beat
lemorne
yet
how
will
you
amuse
yourself
then
aunt
i
adopt
some
boys
to
inherit
what
i
shall
save
from
his
clutches
the
bath
fatigued
her
so
she
remained
in
her
room
for
the
rest
of
the
day
but
she
kept
me
busy
with
a
hundred
trifles
i
wrote
for
her
computed
interest
studied
out
bills
of
fare
till
four
came
and
with
it
a
fog
nevertheless
i
must
ride
on
the
avenue
and
the
carriage
was
ordered
wear
your
silk
margaret
it
will
just
about
last
your
visit
through
the
fog
will
use
it
up
i
am
glad
of
it
i
answered
you
will
ride
every
day
wear
the
bonnet
i
bought
for
you
also
certainly
but
wo
that
go
quicker
in
the
fog
than
the
dress
maybe
but
wear
it
i
rode
every
day
afterward
from
four
to
six
in
the
black
silk
the
mantilla
and
the
white
straw
when
aunt
eliza
went
she
was
so
on
the
alert
for
the
uxbridge
family
carriage
that
she
could
have
had
little
enjoyment
of
the
ride
rocks
never
were
a
passion
with
her
she
said
nor
promontories
chasms
or
sand
she
came
to
newport
to
be
washed
with
when
she
had
washed
up
to
the
doctor
prescription
she
should
leave
as
ignorant
of
the
peculiar
pleasures
of
newport
as
when
she
arrived
she
had
no
fancy
for
its
conglomerate
societies
its
literary
cottages
its
parvenue
suits
of
rooms
its
saloon
habits
and
its
bathing
herds
i
considered
the
rides
a
part
of
the
contract
of
what
was
expected
in
my
two
months
performance
i
did
not
dream
that
i
was
enjoying
them
any
more
than
i
supposed
myself
to
be
enjoying
a
while
pulling
aunt
eliza
to
and
fro
in
the
surf
nothing
in
the
life
around
me
stirred
me
nothing
in
nature
attracted
me
i
liked
the
fog
somehow
it
seemed
to
emanate
from
me
instead
of
rolling
up
from
the
ocean
and
to
represent
me
whether
i
went
alone
or
not
the
coachman
was
ordered
to
drive
a
certain
round
after
that
i
could
extend
the
ride
in
whatever
direction
i
pleased
but
i
always
said
anywhere
william
one
afternoon
which
happened
to
be
a
bright
one
i
was
riding
on
the
road
which
led
to
the
glen
when
i
heard
the
screaming
of
a
flock
of
geese
which
were
waddling
across
the
path
in
front
of
the
horses
i
started
for
i
was
asleep
probably
and
looking
forward
saw
the
uxbridge
carriage
filled
with
ladies
and
children
coming
toward
me
and
by
it
rode
a
gentleman
on
horseback
his
horse
was
rearing
among
the
hissing
geese
but
neither
horse
nor
geese
appeared
to
engage
him
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
me
the
horse
swerved
so
near
that
its
long
mane
almost
brushed
against
me
by
an
irresistible
impulse
i
laid
my
ungloved
hand
upon
it
but
did
not
look
at
the
rider
carriage
and
horseman
passed
on
and
william
resumed
his
pace
a
vague
idea
took
possession
of
me
that
i
had
seen
the
horseman
before
on
my
various
drives
i
had
a
vision
of
a
man
galloping
on
a
black
horse
out
of
the
fog
and
into
it
again
i
was
very
sure
however
that
i
had
never
seen
him
on
so
pleasant
a
day
as
this
william
did
not
bring
his
horses
to
time
it
was
after
six
when
i
went
into
aunt
eliza
parlor
and
found
her
impatient
for
her
tea
and
toast
she
was
crosser
than
the
occasion
warranted
but
i
understood
it
when
she
gave
me
the
outlines
of
a
letter
she
desired
me
to
write
to
her
lawyer
in
new
york
something
had
turned
up
he
had
written
her
the
uxbridges
believed
that
they
had
ferreted
out
what
would
go
against
her
i
told
her
that
i
had
met
the
uxbridge
carriage
one
of
them
is
in
new
york
how
else
could
they
be
giving
me
trouble
just
now
there
was
a
gentleman
on
horseback
beside
the
carriage
did
he
look
mean
and
cunning
he
did
not
wear
his
legal
beaver
up
i
think
but
he
rode
a
fine
horse
and
sat
it
well
a
lawyer
on
horseback
should
like
the
beggar
of
the
adage
ride
to
the
devil
your
business
now
is
the
you
know
it
is
i
did
not
know
but
that
you
had
found
something
besides
to
litigate
it
must
have
been
edward
uxbridge
that
you
saw
he
is
the
brain
of
the
firm
you
expect
van
horn
oh
he
must
come
i
can
not
be
writing
letters
we
had
been
in
newport
two
weeks
when
van
horn
aunt
eliza
lawyer
came
he
said
that
he
would
see
edward
uxbridge
between
them
they
might
delay
a
term
which
he
thought
would
be
best
would
miss
huell
ever
be
ready
for
a
compromise
he
jestingly
asked
are
you
suspicious
she
inquired
no
but
the
uxbridge
chaps
are
clever
he
dined
with
us
and
at
four
aunt
eliza
graciously
asked
him
to
take
a
seat
in
the
carriage
with
me
making
some
excuse
for
not
going
herself
hullo
said
van
horn
when
we
had
reached
the
country
road
there
uxbridge
now
and
he
waved
his
hand
to
him
it
was
indeed
the
black
horse
and
the
same
rider
that
i
had
met
he
reined
up
beside
us
and
shook
hands
with
van
horn
we
are
required
to
answer
this
new
complaint
said
van
horn
uxbridge
nodded
and
after
that
the
judgment
uxbridge
laughed
i
wish
that
certain
gore
of
land
had
been
sunk
instead
of
being
mapped
in
the
surveyor
did
his
business
well
enough
i
am
sure
they
talked
together
in
a
low
voice
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
van
horn
leaned
back
in
his
seat
again
allow
me
he
said
to
introduce
you
uxbridge
to
miss
margaret
huell
miss
huell
niece
huell
brown
you
know
he
added
in
an
explanatory
tone
for
i
was
huell
brown
daughter
oh
said
uxbridge
bowing
and
looking
at
me
gravely
i
looked
at
him
also
he
was
a
pale
man
and
forty
years
old
certainly
i
derived
the
impression
at
once
that
he
had
a
domineering
disposition
perhaps
from
the
way
in
which
he
controlled
his
horse
nice
beast
that
said
van
horn
yes
he
answered
laying
his
hand
on
its
mane
so
that
the
action
brought
immediately
to
my
mind
the
recollection
that
i
had
done
so
too
i
would
not
meet
his
eye
again
however
how
long
shall
you
remain
uxbridge
i
do
know
you
are
not
interested
in
the
lawsuit
miss
huell
he
said
putting
on
his
hat
not
in
the
least
nothing
of
mine
is
involved
we
gain
it
for
your
portion
yet
miss
margaret
said
van
horn
nodding
to
uxbridge
and
bidding
william
drive
on
he
returned
the
next
day
and
we
settled
into
the
routine
of
hotel
life
a
few
mornings
after
she
sent
me
to
a
matinee
which
was
given
by
some
of
the
opera
people
who
were
in
newport
strengthening
the
larynx
with
applications
of
brine
when
the
concert
was
half
over
and
the
audience
were
making
the
usual
hum
and
stir
i
saw
uxbridge
against
a
pillar
with
his
hands
incased
in
gloves
and
holding
a
shiny
hat
he
turned
half
away
when
he
caught
my
eye
and
then
darted
toward
me
you
have
not
been
much
more
interested
in
the
music
than
you
are
in
the
lawsuit
he
said
seating
himself
beside
me
the
of
the
italian
voice
is
agreeable
however
it
makes
one
dreamy
a
child
yes
a
child
not
a
man
nor
a
woman
i
teach
music
i
can
not
dream
over
two
three
a
music
teacher
for
six
years
i
was
aware
that
he
looked
at
me
from
head
to
foot
and
i
picked
at
the
lace
on
my
invariable
black
silk
but
what
did
it
matter
whether
i
owned
that
i
was
a
genteel
pauper
representing
my
aunt
position
for
two
months
or
not
where
in
waterbury
waterbury
differs
from
newport
i
suppose
so
you
suppose
a
young
gentleman
sauntered
by
us
and
uxbridge
called
to
him
to
look
up
the
misses
uxbridge
his
nieces
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
paterfamilias
uxbridge
has
left
his
brood
in
my
charge
he
said
i
try
to
do
my
duty
and
he
held
out
a
twisted
glove
which
he
had
pulled
off
while
talking
what
white
nervous
fingers
he
had
i
thought
they
might
pinch
like
steel
you
suppose
he
repeated
i
do
not
look
at
newport
have
you
observed
waterbury
i
observe
what
is
in
my
sphere
oh
he
was
silent
then
the
second
part
of
the
concert
began
but
i
could
not
compose
myself
to
appreciation
either
the
music
or
i
grew
chaotic
so
many
tumultuous
sounds
i
heard
of
hope
doubt
inquiry
melancholy
and
desire
or
did
i
feel
the
emotions
which
these
words
express
or
was
there
magnetism
stealing
into
me
from
the
quiet
man
beside
me
he
left
me
with
a
bow
before
the
concert
was
over
and
i
saw
him
making
his
way
out
of
the
hall
when
it
was
finished
i
had
been
sent
in
the
carriage
of
course
but
several
carriages
were
in
advance
of
it
before
the
walk
and
i
waited
there
for
william
to
drive
up
when
he
did
so
i
saw
by
the
oscillatory
motion
of
his
head
though
his
arms
and
whiphand
were
perfectly
correct
that
he
was
inebriated
it
was
his
first
occasion
of
meeting
in
full
dress
and
the
occasion
had
proved
too
much
for
him
my
hand
however
was
on
the
coach
door
when
i
heard
uxbridge
say
at
my
elbow
it
is
not
safe
for
you
oh
sir
it
is
in
the
programme
that
i
ride
home
from
the
concert
and
i
prepared
to
step
in
i
shall
sit
on
the
box
then
but
your
nieces
they
are
walking
home
squired
by
a
younger
knight
aunt
eliza
would
say
i
thought
needs
must
when
a
lawyer
drives
and
i
concluded
to
allow
him
to
have
his
way
telling
him
that
he
was
taking
a
great
deal
of
trouble
he
thought
it
would
be
less
if
he
were
allowed
to
sit
inside
both
ways
were
unsafe
nothing
happened
william
drove
well
from
habit
but
james
was
obliged
to
assist
him
to
dismount
uxbridge
waited
a
moment
at
the
door
and
so
there
was
quite
a
little
sensation
which
spread
its
ripples
till
aunt
eliza
was
reached
she
sent
for
william
whose
only
excuse
was
dampness
uxbridge
knew
my
carriage
of
course
she
said
with
a
complacent
voice
he
knew
me
i
replied
you
do
not
look
like
the
huells
i
look
precisely
like
the
young
woman
to
whom
he
was
introduced
by
van
horn
oh
ho
he
thought
it
unsafe
for
me
to
come
alone
under
william
charge
ah
ha
no
more
was
said
on
the
subject
of
his
coming
home
with
me
aunt
eliza
had
several
fits
of
musing
in
the
course
of
the
evening
while
i
read
aloud
to
her
which
had
no
connection
with
the
subject
of
the
book
as
i
put
it
down
she
said
that
it
would
be
well
for
me
to
go
to
church
the
next
day
i
acquiesced
but
remarked
that
my
piety
would
not
require
the
carriage
and
that
i
preferred
to
walk
besides
it
would
be
well
for
william
and
james
to
attend
divine
service
she
could
not
spare
james
and
thought
william
had
better
clean
the
harness
by
way
of
penance
the
morning
proved
to
be
warm
and
sunny
i
donned
a
muslin
dress
of
home
manufacture
and
my
own
bonnet
and
started
for
church
i
had
walked
but
a
few
paces
when
the
consciousness
of
being
and
struck
me
i
halted
looked
about
me
and
concluded
that
i
would
not
go
to
church
but
walk
into
the
fields
i
had
no
knowledge
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
fields
but
i
walked
straight
forward
and
after
a
while
came
upon
some
barren
fields
cropping
with
coarse
rocks
along
which
ran
a
narrow
road
i
turned
into
it
and
soon
saw
beyond
the
rough
coast
the
blue
ring
of
the
ocean
vast
silent
and
splendid
in
the
sunshine
i
found
a
seat
on
the
ruins
of
an
old
among
some
tangled
bushes
and
briers
there
being
no
aunt
eliza
to
pull
through
the
surf
and
no
animated
bathers
near
i
discovered
the
beauty
of
the
sea
and
that
i
loved
it
presently
i
heard
the
steps
of
a
horse
and
to
my
astonishment
uxbridge
rode
past
i
was
glad
he
did
not
know
me
i
watched
him
as
he
rode
slowly
down
the
road
deep
in
thought
he
let
drop
the
bridle
and
the
horse
stopped
as
if
accustomed
to
the
circumstance
and
pawed
the
ground
gently
or
yawed
his
neck
for
pastime
uxbridge
folded
his
arms
and
raised
his
head
to
look
seaward
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
he
were
about
to
address
the
jury
i
had
dropped
so
entirely
from
my
observance
of
the
landscape
that
i
jumped
when
he
resumed
the
bridle
and
turned
his
horse
to
come
back
i
slipped
from
my
seat
to
look
among
the
bushes
determined
that
he
should
not
recognize
me
but
my
attempt
was
a
failure
he
did
not
ride
by
the
second
time
miss
huell
and
he
jumped
from
his
saddle
slipping
his
arm
through
the
bridle
i
am
a
runaway
what
do
you
think
of
the
fugitive
slave
bill
i
approve
of
returning
property
to
its
owners
the
sea
must
have
been
god
temple
first
instead
of
the
groves
i
believe
the
saurians
were
an
orthodox
tribe
did
you
stop
yonder
to
ponder
the
sea
i
was
pondering
vs
huell
he
looked
at
me
earnestly
and
then
gave
a
tug
at
the
bridle
for
his
steed
was
inclined
to
make
a
crude
repast
from
the
bushes
how
was
it
that
i
did
not
detect
you
at
once
he
continued
my
apparel
is
waterbury
apparel
ah
we
walked
up
the
road
slowly
till
we
came
to
the
end
of
it
then
i
stopped
for
him
to
understand
that
i
thought
it
time
for
him
to
leave
me
he
sprang
into
the
saddle
give
us
he
said
bringing
his
horse
close
to
me
we
are
not
on
equal
terms
i
feel
too
humble
afoot
to
salute
you
put
your
foot
on
the
stirrup
then
a
leaf
stuck
in
the
horse
forelock
and
i
pulled
it
off
and
waved
it
in
token
of
farewell
a
powerful
light
shot
into
his
eyes
when
he
saw
my
hand
close
on
the
leaf
may
i
come
and
see
you
he
asked
abruptly
i
will
i
shall
say
neither
or
he
rode
on
at
a
quick
pace
and
i
walked
homeward
forgetting
the
sense
of
liberty
i
had
started
with
and
proceeded
straightway
to
aunt
eliza
i
have
not
been
to
church
aunt
but
to
walk
beyond
the
town
it
was
not
so
nominated
in
the
bond
but
i
went
the
taste
of
freedom
was
so
pleasant
that
i
warn
you
there
is
danger
of
my
when
will
you
have
done
with
newport
i
am
pleased
with
newport
now
she
answered
with
a
curious
intonation
i
like
it
i
do
also
her
keen
eyes
sparkled
did
you
ever
like
anything
when
you
were
with
me
before
never
i
will
tell
you
why
i
like
it
because
i
have
met
and
shall
probably
meet
uxbridge
i
saw
him
he
asked
permission
to
visit
me
let
him
come
he
will
come
but
we
did
not
see
him
either
at
the
hotel
or
when
we
went
abroad
aunt
eliza
rode
with
me
each
afternoon
and
each
morning
we
went
to
the
beach
she
engaged
me
every
moment
when
at
home
and
i
faithfully
performed
all
my
tasks
i
clapped
to
the
door
on
locked
it
against
any
analysis
or
reasoning
upon
any
circumstance
connected
with
uxbridge
the
only
piece
of
treachery
to
my
code
that
i
was
guilty
of
was
the
putting
of
the
leaf
which
i
brought
home
on
sunday
between
the
leaves
of
that
poem
whose
motto
is
mariana
in
the
moated
grange
on
saturday
morning
nearly
a
week
after
i
saw
him
on
my
walk
aunt
eliza
proposed
that
we
should
go
to
turo
street
on
a
shopping
excursion
she
wanted
a
cap
and
various
articles
besides
as
we
went
into
a
large
shop
i
saw
uxbridge
at
a
counter
buying
gloves
her
quick
eye
caught
sight
of
him
and
she
edged
away
saying
she
would
look
at
some
goods
on
the
other
side
i
might
wait
where
i
was
as
he
turned
to
go
out
he
saw
me
and
stopped
i
have
been
in
new
york
since
i
saw
you
he
said
lemorne
sent
for
me
there
is
my
aunt
i
said
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
shall
not
go
away
soon
again
he
remarked
i
missed
newport
greatly
i
made
some
foolish
reply
and
kept
my
eyes
on
aunt
eliza
who
dawdled
unaccountably
he
appeared
amused
and
after
a
little
talk
went
away
aunt
eliza
purchase
was
a
moire
antique
which
she
said
was
to
be
made
for
me
for
bliss
one
of
our
hotel
acquaintances
had
offered
to
chaperon
me
to
the
great
ball
which
would
come
off
in
a
few
days
and
she
had
accepted
the
offer
for
me
there
will
be
no
chance
for
you
to
take
a
walk
instead
she
finished
with
i
can
not
dance
you
know
but
you
will
be
i
was
sent
to
a
of
bliss
recommending
but
i
ordered
the
dress
to
be
made
after
my
own
design
long
plain
sleeves
and
high
plain
corsage
and
requested
that
it
should
not
be
sent
home
till
the
evening
of
the
ball
before
it
came
off
uxbridge
called
and
was
graciously
received
by
aunt
eliza
who
could
be
gracious
to
all
except
her
relatives
i
could
not
but
perceive
however
that
they
watched
each
other
in
spite
of
their
lively
conversation
to
me
he
was
deferential
but
went
over
the
ground
of
our
acquaintance
as
if
it
had
been
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
but
for
my
habit
of
never
calling
in
question
the
behavior
of
those
i
came
in
contact
with
and
of
never
expecting
any
thing
different
from
that
i
received
i
might
have
wondered
over
his
visit
every
person
individuality
was
sacred
to
me
from
the
fact
perhaps
that
my
own
individuality
had
never
been
respected
by
any
person
with
whom
i
had
any
relation
not
even
by
my
own
mother
after
uxbridge
went
i
asked
aunt
eliza
if
she
thought
he
looked
mean
and
cunning
she
laughed
and
replied
that
she
was
bound
to
think
that
lemorne
lawyer
could
not
look
otherwise
when
on
the
night
of
the
ball
i
presented
myself
in
the
moire
antique
for
her
inspection
she
raised
her
eyebrows
but
said
nothing
about
it
i
need
not
be
careful
of
it
i
suppose
aunt
spill
as
much
wine
and
on
it
as
you
like
in
the
bliss
surveyed
me
i
think
i
like
this
mass
of
she
said
your
hair
comes
out
in
contrast
so
brilliantly
why
you
have
not
a
single
ornament
on
it
is
so
easy
to
dress
without
this
was
all
the
conversation
we
had
together
during
the
evening
except
when
she
introduced
some
acquaintance
to
fulfill
her
matronizing
duties
as
i
was
no
dancer
i
was
left
alone
most
of
the
time
and
amused
myself
by
gliding
from
window
to
window
along
the
wall
that
it
might
not
be
observed
that
i
was
a
fixed
flower
still
i
suffered
the
annoyance
of
being
stared
at
by
wandering
squads
of
young
gentlemen
the
curled
darlings
of
the
i
borrowed
bliss
fan
in
one
of
her
visits
for
a
protection
with
that
and
the
embrasure
of
a
remote
window
where
i
finally
stationed
myself
i
hoped
to
escape
further
notice
the
music
of
the
celebrated
band
which
played
between
the
dances
recalled
the
chorus
of
spirits
which
charmed
faust
and
the
fluttering
ribbons
of
drapery
cover
the
plains
cover
the
bowers
where
lovers
deep
in
thought
give
themselves
for
life
the
voice
of
bliss
broke
its
spell
i
bring
an
old
friend
miss
huell
and
he
tells
me
an
acquaintance
of
yours
it
was
uxbridge
i
had
no
thought
of
meeting
you
miss
huell
and
he
coolly
took
the
seat
beside
me
in
the
window
leaving
to
bliss
the
alternative
of
standing
or
of
going
away
she
chose
the
latter
i
saw
you
as
soon
as
i
came
in
he
said
gliding
from
window
to
window
like
a
vessel
hugging
the
shore
in
a
storm
with
colors
at
i
have
no
dancing
partner
how
many
have
observed
you
several
young
gentlemen
moths
oh
no
butterflies
they
must
keep
away
now
are
you
rhadamanthus
and
charon
too
i
would
have
you
row
in
the
same
boat
with
me
now
you
are
fishing
wo
you
compliment
me
did
i
ever
look
better
his
evening
costume
becoming
but
he
looked
pale
and
weary
and
disturbed
but
if
we
were
engaged
for
a
tournament
as
his
behavior
indicated
i
must
do
my
best
at
telling
so
i
told
him
that
he
never
looked
better
and
asked
him
how
i
looked
he
would
look
at
me
presently
he
said
and
decide
bliss
skimmed
by
us
with
nods
and
smiles
as
she
vanished
our
eyes
followed
her
and
we
talked
vaguely
on
various
matters
sounding
ourselves
and
each
other
when
a
furious
redowa
set
in
which
cut
our
conversation
into
rhythm
he
pushed
up
the
window
and
said
look
out
i
turned
my
face
to
him
to
do
so
and
saw
the
moon
at
the
full
riding
through
the
strip
of
sky
which
our
vision
commanded
from
the
moon
our
eyes
fell
on
each
other
after
a
moment
silence
during
which
i
returned
his
steadfast
gaze
for
i
could
not
help
it
he
said
if
we
understand
the
impression
we
make
upon
each
other
what
must
be
said
i
made
no
reply
but
fanned
myself
neither
looking
at
the
moon
nor
upon
the
redowa
nor
upon
any
thing
he
took
the
fan
from
me
speak
of
yourself
he
said
speak
you
i
am
what
i
seem
a
man
within
your
sphere
by
all
the
accidents
of
position
and
circumstance
suited
to
it
have
you
not
learned
it
i
am
not
what
i
seem
i
never
wore
so
splendid
a
dress
as
this
till
tonight
and
shall
not
again
he
gave
the
fan
such
a
twirl
that
its
slender
sticks
snapped
and
it
dropped
like
the
broken
wing
of
a
bird
uxbridge
that
fan
belongs
to
mrs
bliss
he
threw
it
out
of
the
window
you
have
courage
fidelity
and
patience
this
character
with
a
passionate
soul
i
am
sure
that
you
have
such
a
soul
i
do
not
know
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
you
it
happened
on
the
very
day
when
i
passed
you
on
the
way
to
the
glen
i
never
got
away
from
the
remembrance
of
seeing
your
hand
on
the
mane
of
my
horse
he
waited
for
me
to
speak
but
i
could
not
the
balance
of
my
mind
was
gone
why
should
this
have
happened
to
me
a
slave
as
it
had
happened
why
did
i
not
feel
exultant
in
the
sense
of
power
which
the
chance
for
freedom
with
him
should
give
what
is
it
margaret
your
face
is
as
sad
as
death
how
do
you
call
me
as
i
would
call
my
wife
margaret
he
rose
and
stood
before
me
to
screen
my
face
from
observation
i
supposed
so
and
endeavored
to
stifle
my
agitation
you
are
better
he
said
presently
come
go
with
me
and
get
some
refreshment
and
he
beckoned
to
bliss
who
was
down
the
hall
with
an
unwieldy
gentleman
will
you
go
to
supper
now
she
asked
we
are
only
waiting
for
you
uxbridge
answered
offering
me
his
arm
when
we
emerged
into
the
blaze
and
glitter
of
the
i
sought
refuge
in
the
shadow
of
bliss
companion
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
lost
my
own
drink
this
champagne
said
uxbridge
pay
no
attention
to
the
colonel
on
your
left
he
wo
expect
it
neither
must
you
drink
the
champagne
did
not
prevent
me
from
reflecting
on
the
fact
that
he
had
not
yet
asked
whether
i
loved
him
the
spirit
chorus
again
floated
through
my
mind
where
lovers
deep
in
thought
themselves
for
life
i
was
not
allowed
to
myself
i
was
no
he
whispered
to
the
bottom
quaff
take
me
home
will
you
bliss
is
not
ready
tell
her
that
i
must
go
he
went
behind
her
chair
and
whispered
something
and
she
nodded
to
me
to
go
without
her
when
her
carriage
came
up
i
think
he
gave
the
coachman
an
order
to
drive
home
in
a
way
for
we
were
a
long
time
reaching
it
i
kept
my
face
to
the
window
and
he
made
no
effort
to
divert
my
attention
when
we
came
to
a
street
whose
thick
rows
of
trees
shut
out
the
moonlight
my
eager
soul
longed
to
leap
out
into
the
dark
and
demand
of
him
his
heart
soul
life
for
i
struck
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
he
seized
my
hand
oh
i
know
you
margaret
you
are
mine
we
are
at
the
hotel
he
sent
the
carriage
back
and
said
that
he
would
leave
me
at
my
door
he
wished
that
he
could
see
her
then
was
it
magic
that
made
her
open
the
door
before
i
reached
it
have
you
come
on
legal
business
she
asked
him
you
have
divined
what
i
come
for
step
in
step
in
it
very
late
i
should
have
been
in
bed
but
for
neuralgia
did
uxbridge
come
home
with
you
margaret
yes
in
bliss
carriage
i
wished
to
come
before
she
was
ready
to
leave
well
uxbridge
is
old
enough
for
your
protector
certainly
i
forty
do
you
want
margaret
i
do
you
know
exactly
how
much
is
involved
in
your
client
suit
exactly
you
know
also
that
his
claim
is
an
unjust
one
do
i
i
shall
not
be
poor
if
i
lose
if
i
gain
margaret
will
be
rich
will
be
rich
he
repeated
absently
what
have
you
changed
your
mind
respecting
the
orphans
aunt
she
has
and
is
nothing
she
went
on
not
heeding
my
remark
her
father
married
below
his
station
when
he
died
his
wife
fell
back
to
her
place
for
he
spent
his
fortune
and
there
she
and
margaret
must
remain
unless
lemorne
is
defeated
aunt
for
your
succinct
biography
of
my
position
many
thanks
sixty
thousand
dollars
she
continued
van
horn
tells
me
that
as
yet
the
firm
of
uxbridge
brothers
have
only
an
income
no
capital
it
is
true
he
answered
musingly
the
clock
on
the
mantle
struck
two
a
thousand
dollars
for
every
year
of
my
life
she
said
you
and
i
uxbridge
know
the
value
and
beauty
of
money
yes
there
is
beauty
in
money
and
looking
at
me
beauty
without
it
the
striking
of
the
clock
i
soliloquized
proves
that
this
scene
is
not
a
phantasm
margaret
is
fatigued
he
said
rising
may
i
come
it
is
my
part
only
replied
aunt
eliza
to
see
that
she
is
or
is
not
cinderella
if
you
have
ever
thought
of
me
aunt
as
an
individual
you
must
have
seen
that
i
am
not
averse
to
ashes
he
held
my
hand
a
moment
and
then
kissed
me
with
a
kiss
of
appropriation
he
is
in
love
with
you
she
said
after
he
had
gone
i
think
i
know
him
he
has
found
beauty
ignorant
of
itself
he
will
teach
you
to
develop
it
the
next
morning
uxbridge
had
an
interview
with
aunt
eliza
before
he
saw
me
when
we
were
alone
i
asked
him
how
her
eccentricities
affected
him
he
could
not
but
consider
her
violent
prejudiced
warped
and
whimsical
i
told
him
that
i
had
been
taught
to
accept
all
that
she
did
on
this
basis
would
this
explain
to
him
my
silence
in
regard
to
her
can
you
endure
to
live
with
her
in
bond
street
for
the
present
or
would
you
rather
return
to
waterbury
she
desires
my
company
while
she
is
in
newport
only
i
have
never
been
with
her
so
long
before
i
understand
her
law
is
a
game
in
her
estimation
in
which
cheating
can
as
easily
be
carried
on
as
at
cards
her
soul
is
in
this
case
her
soul
is
not
too
large
for
it
will
you
ride
this
afternoon
i
promised
of
course
from
that
time
till
he
left
newport
we
saw
each
other
every
day
and
though
i
found
little
opportunity
to
express
my
own
peculiar
feelings
he
comprehended
many
of
my
wishes
and
all
my
tastes
i
grew
fond
of
him
hourly
had
i
not
reason
never
was
friend
so
considerate
never
was
lover
more
devoted
when
he
had
been
gone
a
few
days
aunt
eliza
declared
that
she
was
ready
to
depart
from
newport
the
days
were
ended
in
two
days
we
were
on
the
sound
coach
horses
servants
and
ourselves
it
was
the
of
september
when
we
arrived
in
bond
street
a
week
from
that
date
samuel
uxbridge
the
senior
partner
of
uxbridge
brothers
went
to
europe
with
his
family
and
i
went
to
waterbury
accompanied
by
uxbridge
he
consulted
mother
in
regard
to
our
marriage
and
appointed
it
in
november
in
october
aunt
eliza
sent
for
me
to
come
back
to
bond
street
and
spend
a
week
she
had
some
fine
marking
to
do
she
wrote
while
there
i
noticed
a
restlessness
in
her
which
i
had
never
before
observed
and
conferred
with
mrs
roll
on
the
matter
she
do
be
awake
nights
a
deal
and
that
the
reason
mrs
roll
said
her
manner
was
the
same
in
other
respects
she
said
she
would
not
give
me
any
thing
for
my
wedding
outfit
but
she
paid
my
fare
from
waterbury
and
back
she
could
not
spare
me
to
go
out
she
told
uxbridge
and
in
consequence
i
saw
little
of
him
while
there
in
november
we
were
married
aunt
eliza
was
not
at
the
wedding
which
was
a
quiet
one
uxbridge
desired
me
to
remain
in
waterbury
till
spring
he
would
not
decide
about
taking
a
house
in
new
york
till
then
by
that
time
his
brother
might
return
and
if
possible
we
would
go
to
europe
for
a
few
months
i
acquiesced
in
all
his
plans
indeed
i
was
not
consulted
but
i
was
happy
happy
in
him
and
happy
in
every
thing
the
winter
passed
in
waiting
for
him
to
come
to
waterbury
every
saturday
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
two
days
he
passed
with
me
in
march
aunt
eliza
wrote
me
that
lemorne
was
beaten
van
horn
had
taken
up
the
whole
contents
of
his
in
her
house
the
evening
before
in
amazement
at
the
turn
things
had
taken
that
night
i
dreamed
of
the
scene
in
the
hotel
at
newport
i
heard
aunt
eliza
saying
if
i
gain
margaret
will
be
rich
and
i
heard
also
the
clock
strike
two
as
it
struck
i
said
husband
is
a
and
woke
with
a
start
