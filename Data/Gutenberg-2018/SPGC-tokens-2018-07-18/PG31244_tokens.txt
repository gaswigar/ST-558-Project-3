an
accident
it
will
be
a
fine
opportunity
for
edna
said
conway
edna
did
not
like
that
word
opportunity
it
always
seemed
to
her
that
it
meant
something
unpleasant
she
had
noticed
that
when
pleasant
things
came
along
they
were
rarely
spoken
of
as
opportunities
but
were
just
so
she
sat
with
her
little
sturdy
legs
dangling
down
from
the
sofa
and
a
very
sober
look
upon
her
round
face
while
her
busy
dimpled
hands
were
folded
quietly
her
mother
leaned
over
and
took
the
plump
little
fingers
in
hers
giving
them
a
squeeze
it
will
be
an
opportunity
she
repeated
as
her
eyes
rested
fondly
on
the
child
by
her
side
but
she
is
only
eight
and
it
seems
like
pushing
her
out
of
the
nest
before
her
wings
are
ready
poor
birdie
o
no
it
does
replied
conway
it
will
only
be
changing
nests
aunt
elizabeth
will
be
just
like
a
mother
to
her
it
is
not
like
a
my
dear
i
know
replied
conway
resting
her
cheek
against
edna
little
dark
head
should
you
like
to
go
to
aunt
elizabeth
dear
cousin
louis
will
be
there
you
know
put
in
edna
father
and
you
have
fine
times
together
suppose
i
read
to
you
what
aunt
elizabeth
says
write
my
dear
nephew
that
it
seems
prudent
on
account
of
your
wife
health
that
you
should
go
to
florida
i
have
received
some
such
news
from
william
who
is
about
to
take
a
trip
to
california
in
search
of
health
he
has
asked
me
to
take
charge
of
his
son
louis
during
his
absence
should
you
not
like
to
place
edna
also
with
us
during
the
time
you
are
gone
she
could
then
attend
school
and
would
find
a
pleasing
companion
in
her
cousin
louis
who
i
fear
will
be
somewhat
lonely
with
only
myself
and
your
uncle
justus
the
advantages
of
a
city
are
great
and
i
need
not
say
we
will
endeavor
h
h
never
mind
the
rest
said
conway
laying
down
the
letter
you
know
daughter
aunt
elizabeth
lives
in
a
big
city
where
there
are
fine
shops
and
beautiful
parks
moreover
you
would
meet
a
lot
of
nice
little
girls
in
the
school
it
would
be
much
nicer
than
for
you
to
stay
here
with
sister
and
the
boys
while
we
are
gone
do
you
think
so
yes
said
edna
her
little
fat
hand
enfolded
in
her
mother
feeling
very
moist
from
the
excitement
of
the
prospect
of
course
i
know
it
is
best
said
conway
and
i
know
aunt
elizabeth
means
to
be
as
kind
as
possible
here
a
wistful
look
came
into
the
mother
eyes
but
edna
only
saw
visions
of
gay
shops
while
she
pictured
romps
with
her
cousin
louis
she
remembered
very
little
of
this
great
aunt
except
that
she
had
once
sent
her
a
most
beautiful
doll
with
a
cunning
trunk
filled
with
such
neat
frocks
and
aprons
together
with
a
real
little
slate
and
books
aunt
elizabeth
had
written
a
tiny
letter
which
the
doll
had
brought
pinned
to
her
muff
in
the
letter
the
doll
name
was
said
to
be
ada
and
many
instructions
were
given
as
to
her
behavior
and
studies
so
ada
and
aunt
elizabeth
were
inseparably
connected
in
edna
mind
i
must
go
get
ada
ready
she
said
jumping
down
from
the
sofa
on
which
she
had
been
sitting
when
shall
i
go
to
the
city
papa
next
week
he
answered
and
the
little
girl
on
business
intent
ran
to
the
playroom
there
was
a
great
deal
to
do
before
she
should
go
away
she
reflected
she
must
clean
house
and
see
that
all
ada
clothes
were
clean
and
whole
for
it
would
never
do
to
let
aunt
elizabeth
find
that
they
had
not
been
kept
carefully
they
are
not
all
here
said
the
child
sitting
down
on
the
floor
lilypaws
tore
up
the
muff
and
gyp
ate
up
one
of
the
books
then
the
wind
blew
away
an
apron
and
a
skirt
that
day
i
washed
them
and
put
them
out
on
the
grass
to
dry
i
have
to
tell
aunt
elizabeth
about
that
she
know
it
was
an
accident
maybe
sister
will
make
me
some
more
i
go
ask
her
now
leaving
ada
with
her
wardrobe
scattered
over
the
nursery
floor
edna
sought
sister
who
was
studying
her
lessons
curled
up
on
the
window
seat
of
her
room
i
going
to
the
city
to
live
next
week
announced
edna
importantly
and
i
have
to
get
ada
clothes
in
order
sister
wo

help
me
going
to
the
city
cried
celia
lowering
her
book
in
surprise
what
do
you
mean
o
you
only
playing
no
i
not
i
am
really
and
truly
going
papa
and
mamma
said

go
and
of
course
i
help
you
replied
celia
you
poor
little
midget
i
not
poor
at
all
replied
edna
for
cousin
louis
is
going
to
be
there
and
i
going
to
play
with
him
in
the
park
and
i
going
to
buy
things
in
the
beautiful
shops
what
shall
i
buy
for
you
sister
o
i
do
know
do
buy
me
anything
or
if
you
should
see
a
belt
buckle
exactly
like
grace
neal
i
should
like
to
have
one
but
only
if
it
is
all
right
i
buy
that
and
send
it
to
you
decided
edna
very
positively
while
she
made
up
her
mind
to
notice
grace
neal
buckle
very
particularly
the
next
time
she
saw
her
there
was
much
hurry
and
excitement
for
the
next
week
edna
did
not
go
to
school
at
all
during
that
time
for
the
dressmaker
was
likely
at
any
time
to
want
her
to
stand
up
to
be
fitted
something
edna
did
not
like
at
all
i
believe
i
just
as
soon
go
to
school
she
fretted
while
miss
marsh
with
her
mouth
full
of
pins
pinched
up
here
and
trimmed
off
there
bidding
the
little
girl
to
stand
still
i
am
standing
as
still
as
a
mouse
she
protested
about
as
still
as
that
canary
bird
returned
miss
marsh
shrug
your
shoulders
while
i
cut
out
this
armhole
i
might
snip
you
with
the
scissors
that
was
something
really
to
be
dreaded
so
edna
did
stand
very
still
while
the
cold
steel
points
circled
her
plump
shoulder
o
dear
she
sighed
when
the
operation
was
finished
i
hope
i
need
any
more
clothes
for
a
year
but
even
the
discomfort
of
did
not
do
away
with
the
pleasure
the
little
girl
felt
in
her
pretty
new
frocks
and
it
seemed
no
time
before
her
trunk
stood
ready
packed
and
she
had
said
to
gyp
and
lilypaws
to
bobby
in
his
cage
and
to
the
chickens
each
and
every
one
her
own
special
pet
hen
snowflake
being
entreated
not
to
hatch
out
any
new
chickens
till
edna
should
return
it
was
rather
a
solemn
moment
after
all
when
mamma
hugged
her
and
kissed
her
with
the
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
when
the
cook
jane
hoped
they
see
her
again
and
when
the
boys
thrust
parting
gifts
into
her
hands
frank
a
small
mouth
organ
and
charlie
a
wad
of
something
which
was
afterward
discovered
to
be
taffy
wrapped
in
brown
paper
when
celia
winked
away
the
from
her
lashes
and
called
her
precious
little
sister
it
was
therefore
with
the
very
opposite
of
a
smile
upon
her
face
that
she
climbed
up
the
steps
into
the
car
but
the
dimples
soon
came
back
again
as
the
car
moved
off
and
the
boys
standing
on
a
woodpile
cheered
and
waved
their
hats
as
the
little
head
at
the
window
nodded
it
was
quite
a
long
journey
to
the
city
to
which
edna
was
going
a
whole
day
and
night
to
be
on
the
cars
and
after
the
first
few
hours
the
little
girl
began
to
get
very
restless
even
the
picture
papers
her
father
bought
her
and
the
little
excitement
of
stopping
once
in
a
while
at
a
station
where
could
be
seen
people
did
not
serve
to
keep
edna
from
getting
very
tired
but
it
grew
dark
early
and
when
the
porter
came
in
to
make
up
the
berths
she
felt
that
she
would
be
quite
ready
to
clamber
up
into
that
funny
little
bed
above
her
papa
it
just
like
being
put
away
on
a
shelf
she
laughed
suppose
i
should
tumble
out
papa
then
i
think
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
take
the
lower
berth
he
replied
o
no
i
like
it
best
up
here
i
can
peep
out
better
are
you
going
to
bed
too
papa
not
just
yet
i
am
going
to
the
for
a
while
you
go
to
sleep
daughter
and
i
be
back
pretty
soon
it
was
some
time
before
the
child
could
compose
herself
the
voices
of
the
people
in
the
car
the
clatter
of
a
passing
train
the
letting
down
of
the
berths
or
the
opening
of
a
door
all
tended
to
keep
her
awake
but
after
a
little
time
she
began
to
say
over
a
rhyme
she
had
learned
at
school
keeping
time
to
the
motion
of
the
car
as
she
repeated
to
cuddle
up
the
baby
ferns
and
smooth
the
lily
sheet
and
tuck
a
warm
white
blanket
down
around
the
roses
feet
and
before
she
knew
it
she
was
fast
asleep
how
long
she
had
slept
she
had
not
the
slightest
idea
when
she
was
awakened
very
suddenly
by
a
jerk
of
the
car
which
nearly
threw
her
from
the
berth
she
sat
up
rubbing
her
eyes
wondering
where
she
was
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
she
must
be
dreaming
that
she
was
packed
away
on
a
high
shelf
in
such
a
queer
place
but
presently
she
was
quite
and
found
that
there
was
a
great
commotion
going
on
men
with
lanterns
hurried
through
the
car
women
began
to
scream
babies
to
cry
it
all
right
some
one
shouted
do
be
alarmed
this
was
enough
to
frighten
edna
and
she
began
to
scramble
on
her
clothes
as
quickly
as
possible
first
peering
down
into
the
berth
below
but
seeing
no
papa
there
o
where
is
my
papa
where
is
my
papa
she
whispered
under
her
breath
as
the
little
trembling
fingers
tried
to
fasten
the
buttons
hurriedly
presently
some
one
parted
the
curtains
and
looked
in
it
was
the
negro
porter
me
miss
he
said
but
de
folks
is
all
leavin
de
cyar

up
in

the
porter

her
from
the
car
now
i
set
you
down
on
dis
ole
stump
an
yuh
be
safe
said
he
and
edna
found
herself
at
midnight
by
the
side
of
the
railroad
in
what
seemed
to
be
a
bit
of
woodland
she
could
hear
the
rushing
of
water
and
see
the
blazing
car
ahead
the
rest
of
the
train
had
been
backed
along
the
track
and
some
of
the
women
and
men
seeing
the
rear
cars
were
not
hurt
were
climbing
back
into
them
there
was
a
crowd
of
people
moving
about
farther
up
the
railroad
and
edna
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
try
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
her
father
so
she
took
her
way
toward
the
throng
of
people
who
were
gathered
about
the
baggage
car
which
lay
over
on
its
side
by
an
embankment
you
better
go
back
to
the
rear
cars
little
girl
said
some
one
as
she
came
up
where
is
your
mother
she
is
at
home
replied
edna
i
want
my
papa
is
he
burned
up
no
indeed
no
one
is
burned
up
was
the
reply
you
go
back
and
we
find
your
father
what
is
his
name
his
name
returned
edna
is
henry
parker
conway
anybody
about
here
by
the
name
of
conway
shouted
the
man
but
there
was
no
one
answering
to
that
name
in
the
crowd
and
edna
picked
her
way
back
to
the
stump
where
the
porter
had
placed
her
feeling
very
lonely
and
miserable
o
dear
she
said
to
herself
what
shall
i
do
suppose
papa
does
come
for
me
that
man
said
they
had
sent
ahead
for
another
engine
and
that
we
should
go
on
pretty
soon
but
i
ca
go
without
my
papa
and
the
tears
began
to
run
down
edna
cheeks
she
was
beginning
to
feel
cold
and
it
was
very
forlorn
to
sit
there
alone
on
a
stump
all
night
i
believe
i
go
back
to
the
car
she
said
but
i
do
know
where
i
belong
by
great
effort
she
managed
to
climb
up
on
the
high
step
of
the
first
car
then
made
her
way
inside
and
stood
there
looking
wistfully
around
why
you
poor
little
child
said
a
lady
coming
forward
where
did
you
come
from
i
came
from
the
stump
replied
edna
and
i
want
my
papa
she
continued
her
lip
quivering
and
her
eyes
filling
where
is
he
i
do
know
returned
edna
and
putting
her
head
against
the
arm
which
was
placed
sympathetically
around
her
she
sobbed
outright
there
there
tell
me
all
about
it
said
her
friend
we
make
it
all
right
as
soon
as
my
husband
comes
in
come
sit
down
here
by
me
your
father
ca
be
very
far
away
and
you
know
no
one
has
been
very
badly
hurt
edna
gave
the
best
account
of
herself
that
she
could
and
the
lady
comforted
her
and
promised
that
she
should
be
safely
cared
for
after
what
seemed
a
long
time
just
as
the
morning
was
breaking
the
train
was
again
on
its
way
but
no
papa
had
appeared
although
the
husband
of
edna
new
friend
had
gone
through
the
cars
to
look
for
him
chapter
ii
getting
settled
poor
little
edna
she
was
so
unhappy
so
anxious
as
the
train
moved
along
faster
and
faster
even
kind
porter
by
her
side
felt
that
she
did
not
know
just
how
to
comfort
the
child
although
she
did
try
very
hard
and
at
least
made
the
little
girl
feel
that
she
should
be
safely
guarded
on
her
way
to
her
aunt
house
for
porter
lived
in
the
same
city
and
had
promised
to
take
edna
in
charge
and
deliver
her
safely
at
her
aunt
very
door
the
rising
sun
was
lighting
up
the
mountain
tops
and
finding
its
way
into
the
deep
gorges
when
suddenly
edna
started
to
her
feet
with
a
cry
as
the
door
opened
and
a
man
came
in
very
pale
with
his
head
bandaged
and
his
hand
in
a
sling
papa
papa
a
little
voice
rang
out
in
tones
of
such
gladness
as
caused
everyone
in
the
car
to
turn
it
was
edna
father
truly
who
made
his
way
over
to
the
seat
where
his
little
girl
was
sitting
with
his
uninjured
hand
fondly
clasped
in
that
of
his
daughter
he
told
how
he
had
happened
to
be
absent
from
her
so
long
i
was
in
the
smoking
car
when
the
accident
occurred
he
said
and
i
was
thrown
forward
so
violently
that
i
was
stunned
and
was
carried
out
of
the
car
to
a
place
of
safety
later
i
was
placed
in
a
berth
in
the
car
ahead
of
this
and
lay
in
a
stupor
till
a
short
time
ago
when
some
one
discovered
me
and
asked
if
my
name
were
conway
saying
that
inquiries
had
been
made
for
me
in
the
confusion
and
trouble
i
had
been
forgotten
but
a
doctor
has
been
looking
me
over
and
tells
me
i
am
only
a
little
shaken
up
so
all
i
needed
was
a
bit
of
patching
as
you
see
by
this
cut
head
and
sprained
wrist
i
shall
be
as
good
as
new
in
a
few
days
poor
little
daughter
i
suspect
that
you
fancied
all
sorts
of
things
about
me
indeed
she
did
said
porter
smiling
we
were
really
alarmed
ourselves
for
your
safety
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
porter
you
know
how
good
she
has
been
to
me
said
edna
looking
up
gratefully
so
the
rest
of
the
journey
they
were
all
on
very
good
terms
and
when
edna
parted
from
her
kind
friends
at
the
depot
it
was
with
a
promise
to
go
and
see
them
as
soon
as
she
could
we
have
two
boys
but
no
little
girl
porter
told
her
but
we
have
a
good
time
even
if
we
have
no
dolls
in
our
house
the
accident
had
kept
them
from
reaching
aunt
elizabeth
at
the
time
they
expected
and
it
was
quite
dark
by
the
time
they
arrived
at
the
house
edna
therefore
could
not
see
much
of
the
street
but
she
could
see
the
open
square
near
by
the
door
was
opened
by
uncle
justus
himself
heigho
little
girl
he
exclaimed
what
all
this
we
were
beginning
to
think
you
were
not
coming
was
aunt
greeting
as
she
too
came
forward
what
detained
you
henry
why
what
has
happened
to
you
we
had
an
accident
explained
conway
and
he
proceeded
to
give
an
account
of
it
while
edna
sat
looking
about
her
and
wondering
where
her
cousin
louis
was
she
was
not
long
wondering
for
in
a
few
moments
the
door
of
the
opened
and
a
little
boy
about
ten
years
of
age
came
quietly
in
he
was
and
pale
and
did
not
burst
into
the
room
as
frank
or
charlie
would
have
done
louis
here
is
cousin
edna
said
aunt
elizabeth
come
and
shake
hands
with
her
then
go
with
her
to
find
ellen
who
will
show
her
to
her
room
she
will
want
to
prepare
for
supper
edna
cast
an
appealing
glance
at
her
father
as
she
went
out
but
he
was
absorbed
in
talking
to
uncle
justus
and
after
shaking
hands
absently
with
louis
returned
to
his
conversation
and
edna
followed
louis
feeling
a
little
aggrieved
at
being
sent
off
in
this
way
my
mamma
would
have
gone
with
a
little
girl
herself
she
thought
as
she
waited
for
louis
to
return
with
a
candle
for
which
he
went
to
the
kitchen
say
he
said
on
his
return
ellen
is
setting
the
table
i
take
you
to
your
room
it
up
stairs
and
he
swung
around
the
post
of
the
baluster
to
run
up
ahead
of
her
on
the
first
landing
he
paused
this
is
the
parlor
he
said
and
edna
peeped
in
the
appearance
of
the
room
gave
her
a
subdued
feeling
as
if
she
must
not
speak
above
a
whisper
the
windows
were
heavily
curtained
and
the
children
voices
had
a
muffled
sound
as
they
slipped
cautiously
inside
the
furniture
was
big
and
ponderous
on
a
little
stand
was
placed
a
heavy
family
bible
a
hymn
book
bound
in
purple
velvet
with
gilt
clasp
lying
on
top
edna
thought
this
last
very
beautiful
and
looked
back
at
it
as
they
stole
quietly
out
of
the
room
on
the
next
floor
were
the
schoolrooms
these
too
were
shown
edna
by
louis
these
two
rooms
are
the
girls
schoolrooms
and
back
there
is
the
boys
room
he
explained
it
must
be
a
big
school
does
uncle
justus
teach
all
the
scholars
asked
edna
with
a
little
hope
that
the
shaggy
eyebrows
would
not
be
within
her
line
of
vision
during
all
the
school
hours
no
replied
louis
aunt
elizabeth
teaches
the
boys
and
miss
ashurst
the
little
girls
edna
was
relieved
and
followed
louis
up
the
last
flight
to
the
top
floor
my
she
said
it
is
up
at
the
top
of
the
house
it
this
is
a
queer
house
i
never
saw
one
like
it
with
the
parlor
on
the
second
floor
where
is
your
room
louis
i
sleep
in
a
little
room
next
to
aunt
and
uncle
here
yours
ellen
has
that
one
next
to
you
and
he
flung
open
a
door
but
by
the
dim
light
of
the
candle
edna
could
not
see
all
the
details
there
is
any
gas
up
here
explained
louis
but
you
wo
mind
that
it
is
pretty
high
up
too
but
you
can
see
ever
so
far
from
this
window
the
harbor
where
the
ships
sail
and
where
the
bridge
crosses
this
side
and
you
can
see
the
cars
and
lots
of
things
i
a
heap
rather
be
up
here
but
aunt
elizabeth
said
and
that
settled
it
there
now
can
i
do
anything
for
you
he
asked
setting
down
little
hand
satchel
thank
you
replied
the
little
girl
helplessly
she
was
so
used
to
having
sister
or
mamma
at
hand
that
it
seemed
very
queer
to
be
left
alone
and
after
louis
had
shut
the
door
she
stood
looking
around
not
knowing
just
what
to
do
but
she
concluded
she
must
take
off
her
coat
and
hat
anyhow
this
she
did
and
then
washed
off
some
of
the
dust
as
best
she
could
smoothing
down
her
hair
with
her
little
wet
hands
i
wonder
if
i
am
to
blow
out
the
candle
or
take
it
back
she
said
to
herself
but
a
recollection
of
the
dark
passageway
decided
her
to
take
the
candle
down
stairs
and
she
proceeded
to
descend
feeling
rather
scared
as
she
passed
the
dusky
corners
of
a
strange
house
supper
was
ready
shortly
after
she
entered
the
it
consisted
of
rolls
dried
apples
stewed
grated
cheese
weak
tea
and
a
dry
kind
of
cake
which
tasted
of
the
wooden
box
in
which
it
had
been
kept
edna
never
forgot
the
taste
of
that
cake
with
which
she
became
very
familiar
as
time
went
on
illustration
uncle
justus
uncle
justus
was
a
very
quiet
dignified
man
with
a
roman
nose
and
gray
side
whiskers
he
wore
spectacles
which
added
to
the
effect
of
the
shaggy
eyebrows
edna
was
very
much
afraid
of
him
at
first
aunt
elizabeth
was
portly
and
bland
but
her
sharp
eyes
had
a
way
of
looking
you
through
and
through
edna
soon
discovered
that
she
was
a
person
much
more
to
be
feared
than
uncle
justus
she
allowed
no
nonsense
no
indecision
when
she
looked
at
you
during
mealtime
and
said
in
a
severe
tone
butter
or
molasses
if
you
wavered
an
instant
you
were
told
you
could
have
neither
since
you
did
not
know
what
you
wanted
to
be
allowed
both
was
out
of
the
question
and
so
it
was
a
serious
matter
with
a
slice
of
bread
on
your
plate
to
make
a
wise
choice
instantly
after
supper
edna
and
louis
played
quietly
with
a
queer
game
called
the
war
of
the
revolution
it
was
played
by
using
a
teetotum
and
counters
tiring
of
this
the
children
next
looked
at
a
huge
picture
book
containing
bible
stories
with
very
highly
colored
illustrations
edna
was
charmed
with
it
but
was
told
that
hereafter
it
was
to
be
viewed
only
on
sundays
although
as
a
special
privilege
it
could
be
examined
this
first
evening
the
little
girl
was
far
too
tired
to
care
to
sit
up
late
after
the
exciting
scenes
she
had
gone
through
and
of
which
she
told
louis
in
reply
to
his
eager
questionings
my
he
had
said
i
like
to
have
been
there
wo
they
all
stare
at
you
in
school
when
i
tell
them
to
her
little
room
edna
was
taken
by
the
maid
ellen
who
was
an
uncouth
kindly
creature
and
from
the
first
befriended
the
little
girl
i
sit
up
here
dear
she
said
an
kape
open
me
dhure
so
yez
will
know
i
there
and
edna
fell
asleep
quite
comforted
by
the
near
presence
of
the
girl
she
was
aroused
the
next
morning
by
a
voice
saying
come
come
child
it
high
time
to
be
up
i
let
you
sleep
overtime
after
your
journey
but
you
must
be
ready
for
school
and
opening
her
eyes
the
child
saw
aunt
elizabeth
standing
over
her
am
i
to
go
to
school
she
asked
sitting
up
straight
why
not
edna
had
no
reply
ready
she
did
know
why
not
except
that
her
father
was
going
home
that
afternoon
and
she
had
hoped
to
have
the
morning
with
him
aunt
elizabeth
however
would
not
listen
to
protests
but
bade
her
niece
hurry
down
who
will
fasten
my
buttons
asked
edna
aunt
elizabeth
looked
at
her
severely
a
big
girl
eight
years
old
that
has
to
be
dressed
like
a
baby
she
exclaimed
hereafter
you
must
fasten
your
own
buttons
and
she
left
edna
sitting
on
the
floor
feeling
rather
disconsolate
at
this
prospect
however
by
fastening
the
buttons
in
front
and
then
twisting
the
garments
around
slipping
her
arms
into
the
shoulder
straps
last
she
managed
all
the
buttons
but
those
of
her
frock
and
for
this
she
concluded
she
must
ask
ellen
help
so
she
stole
softly
down
stairs
and
out
into
the
kitchen
where
the
willing
maid
helped
her
through
the
difficulty
and
so
the
new
life
began
school
was
rather
pleasant
after
all
miss
ashurst
made
the
lessons
interesting
and
while
uncle
justus
had
an
eye
to
the
schoolroom
where
the
little
girls
were
he
seldom
came
in
although
to
him
were
offenders
sent
edna
thought
she
could
not
possibly
endure
the
disgrace
of
being
ordered
into
the
next
room
so
terrible
did
it
seem
to
her
consequently
she
took
care
to
give
no
cause
she
soon
became
acquainted
with
the
little
girls
and
chose
her
special
companions
from
them
they
were
however
never
allowed
to
visit
her
as
she
soon
found
out
to
her
confusion
for
in
the
innocence
of
her
heart
she
asked
her
deskmate
to
come
and
bring
her
dolls
one
friday
afternoon
but
the
little
visitor
was
not
allowed
to
enter
the
house
and
was
given
the
message
that
edna
was
not
permitted
to
receive
company
unless
invited
by
her
aunt
poor
little
edna
was
overcome
with
shame
and
for
the
first
time
realized
what
real
homesickness
meant
my
mamma
let
me
have
little
girls
to
come
and
play
with
me
she
sobbed
and
i
used
to
go
to
play
with
them
aunt
elizabeth
was
a
trifle
less
stern
than
usual
perhaps
she
did
have
some
tender
feeling
for
the
child
stop
crying
my
dear
she
said
you
and
louis
may
go
and
take
a
walk
in
the
square
i
will
take
you
to
see
some
children
who
will
i
hope
make
you
understand
how
highly
favored
you
are
run
along
now
and
get
your
hat
you
may
stay
out
an
hour
in
the
hall
uncle
justus
met
her
and
seeing
her
wet
eyes
asked
what
is
the
matter
little
girl
a
grieving
sigh
was
his
only
answer
so
he
patted
her
head
and
gave
her
a
nickel
there
is
a
nice
little
shop
around
the
corner
he
said
louis
can
take
you
there
to
buy
some
candy
this
showed
such
real
sympathy
that
edna
looked
up
gratefully
and
ran
to
find
her
cousin
good
cried
louis
whom
she
found
in
the
schoolroom
studying
his
lessons
for
monday
i
tired
of
staying
here
and
they
wo
let
me
play
with
the
boys
in
the
street
there
is
one
boy
though
that
i
do
know
i
see
him
in
the
square
sometimes
he
is
a
jolly
fellow
they
do
know
i
see
him
o
is
that
right
asked
edna
ho
why
not
why
i
do
know
it
it
kind
of
deceiving
i
tell
if
they
ask
me
replied
louis
conclusively
come
i
race
you
around
the
square
and
they
started
out
the
square
was
a
pretty
place
even
in
winter
weather
in
the
center
was
a
circular
coping
from
which
a
flight
of
steps
led
down
to
a
spring
the
water
of
which
ran
constantly
from
two
lions
mouths
edna
had
never
seen
anything
like
this
before
and
was
filled
with
admiration
it
ever
after
remained
a
delight
to
her
and
to
the
square
she
would
rather
go
than
anywhere
else
the
candy
shop
around
the
corner
was
another
place
to
be
favored
it
was
a
queer
little
affair
quite
unlike
the
big
shops
on
the
other
streets
but
there
was
something
the
children
liked
about
the
way
the
wares
were
shown
and
the
german
woman
who
kept
the
shop
was
always
ready
to
attend
to
the
little
ones
helping
them
out
when
it
came
to
be
a
serious
question
whether
peanut
taffy
or
sour
balls
should
be
chosen
on
this
friday
afternoon
the
gift
from
uncle
justus
was
spent
in
little
scalloped
cakes
of
maple
sugar
at
which
the
children
nibbled
as
they
ran
back
to
the
square
there
phil
blaney
now
said
louis
come
along
edna
and
the
little
girl
followed
her
cousin
to
a
bench
where
a
boy
somewhat
older
than
louis
was
sitting
he
looked
edna
over
rather
contemptuously
and
she
on
her
part
took
a
dislike
to
him
which
she
never
overcame
although
the
boy
tried
to
be
friendly
especially
after
louis
told
him
of
edna
exciting
journey
but
the
hour
was
soon
up
and
ellen
at
the
door
beckoned
them
in
edna
wanted
to
tell
about
phil
blaney
but
did
know
just
what
to
do
about
it
especially
when
louis
called
her
a
telltale
for
thinking
of
such
a
thing
before
she
decided
the
question
something
happened
which
put
it
quite
out
of
her
mind
chapter
iii
what
happened
the
happening
came
about
in
this
way
aunt
elizabeth
had
promised
to
take
edna
to
see
some
poor
little
children
who
she
said
might
make
edna
feel
how
highly
favored
she
was
aunt
elizabeth
horner
was
a
good
woman
although
she
was
rather
hard
on
little
people
having
been
brought
up
in
a
very
strict
way
herself
but
she
was
interested
in
many
charities
and
missions
was
always
making
warm
clothing
for
the
poor
and
many
a
time
sat
up
late
at
night
after
a
busy
day
in
order
to
fashion
pretty
cornucopias
boxes
and
other
fancy
articles
for
some
fair
in
which
she
was
interested
she
was
one
of
the
managers
of
an
institution
called
the
home
of
the
friendless
and
favored
it
more
than
any
of
her
other
charities
the
name
appealed
strongly
to
edna
and
she
was
very
anxious
to
see
the
little
children
we
want
to
build
a
nice
big
new
home
for
these
poor
wanderers
who
have
no
other
home
and
no
friends
so
we
are
going
to
hold
a
fair
said
aunt
elizabeth
as
they
stopped
at
the
door
of
a
house
on
a
little
side
street
this
is
too
small
a
place
for
the
many
little
children
who
should
be
provided
for
illustration
aunt
elizabeth
edna
was
very
much
interested
in
seeing
the
little
waifs
in
hearing
them
sing
and
in
seeing
where
they
ate
and
slept
she
was
very
thoughtful
as
she
sat
perched
up
on
the
seat
of
the
car
by
her
side
during
their
homeward
journey
i
wish
i
could
do
something
for
them
she
said
after
a
while
so
you
can
my
dear
replied
aunt
elizabeth
you
can
help
me
to
make
something
for
the
fair
do
you
think
i
really
could
cried
edna
delightedly
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
if
you
are
willing
to
give
up
some
of
your
playtime
you
can
help
me
a
great
deal
by
cutting
out
the
paper
for
my
cornucopias
and
perhaps
you
could
do
some
of
the
pasting
yourself
this
was
surely
a
pleasant
prospect
and
the
little
girl
was
much
pleased
at
it
she
was
a
child
and
a
generous
one
too
so
she
not
only
helped
to
make
the
pretty
things
but
brought
all
her
pennies
to
her
aunt
to
spend
in
materials
i
will
tell
you
what
we
can
do
with
the
pennies
said
aunt
elizabeth
we
will
buy
a
lot
of
little
dolls
and
you
can
help
dress
them
i
will
have
a
great
big
shoe
at
my
table
in
which
we
can
have
the
old
woman
who
had
many
children
she
did
know
what
to
do
where
will
you
get
the
old
woman
asked
edna
her
face
beaming
louis
was
standing
by
o
aunt
elizabeth
he
said
becoming
interested
in
the
plan
let
me
give
the
money
for
the
old
woman
so
it
was
settled
and
edna
gave
up
every
spare
moment
to
helping
all
her
thoughts
were
upon
the
fair
and
she
thought
nothing
more
beautiful
than
the
pretty
things
which
aunt
elizabeth
deft
fingers
turned
out
there
were
little
mugs
and
boats
and
pitchers
all
made
of
pasteboard
and
fancy
papers
these
were
to
be
filled
with
candy
and
made
a
fine
show
as
they
stood
on
a
table
ready
to
be
sent
away
one
afternoon
aunt
elizabeth
wanted
some
ribbon
in
a
hurry
i
am
going
to
send
you
downtown
edna
she
said
you
are
big
enough
to
find
your
way
alone
hurry
back
for
i
want
the
ribbon
as
soon
as
i
can
get
it
ca
louis
go
with
me
no
he
has
to
study
one
of
his
lessons
which
he
missed
this
morning
it
is
high
time
you
were
learning
to
be
more
i
will
tell
you
just
how
and
where
to
go
edna
heart
fluttered
at
this
undertaking
she
had
never
been
downtown
alone
and
she
was
much
afraid
that
she
could
not
find
the
way
but
she
decided
to
do
the
best
she
could
especially
as
she
knew
her
aunt
would
consider
any
objection
in
the
light
of
disobedience
it
was
all
very
easy
to
get
in
the
car
pay
her
fare
and
ask
the
conductor
to
let
her
out
at
such
a
street
so
she
managed
very
easily
to
reach
the
shop
and
get
the
ribbon
but
to
take
the
car
home
she
was
obliged
to
cross
the
street
and
here
came
trouble
for
there
were
horses
dashing
up
and
down
trolley
cars
coming
this
way
and
that
and
altogether
it
was
a
very
confusing
point
therefore
edna
stood
a
long
time
on
the
curb
before
she
dared
to
venture
across
but
finally
she
summoned
up
courage
when
the
way
seemed
tolerably
clear
and
she
managed
to
reach
the
opposite
side
but
looking
back
at
a
trolley
car
which
seemed
close
at
hand
she
hurried
faster
than
her
stout
little
legs
could
be
relied
upon
to
take
her
and
down
she
went
in
the
mud
of
the
gutter
she
picked
herself
up
in
an
agony
of
shame
lest
she
should
be
laughed
at
and
ran
on
as
fast
as
she
could
up
the
street
but
unfortunately
in
the
wrong
direction
for
when
she
stood
still
and
looked
about
her
there
were
no
blue
cars
to
be
seen
and
it
all
looked
strange
she
felt
in
her
pocket
for
her
parcel
it
was
safe
but
her
car
fare
was
gone
and
she
stood
a
pitiful
little
object
then
the
big
tears
began
to
come
as
she
walked
along
very
fast
o
dear
i
lost
she
said
to
herself
and
i
have
to
walk
home
and
aunt
elizabeth
is
in
a
hurry
and
she
scold
me
o
dear
o
dear
i
want
my
own
home
i
do
i
do
she
began
then
to
run
along
very
fast
again
to
hide
her
tears
from
and
presently
she
came
bump
up
against
another
little
girl
who
had
also
been
running
the
two
children
coming
to
such
an
abrupt
standstill
stared
at
each
other
edna
saw
a
poor
ragged
dirty
child
with
wild
locks
and
the
little
girl
saw
edna
with
the
tears
still
coursing
down
her
cheeks
her
pretty
coat
and
frock
stained
with
mud
and
her
hat
knocked
very
much
to
one
side
it
was
the
ragged
girl
who
smiled
first
i
knocked
ye
down
did
i
she
said
where
was
ye
going
so
fast
i
am
going
home
replied
edna
only
i
do
know
how
to
get
there
yer

edna
stared
i
think
i
very
unlucky
what
makes

say
that
yer
lucky
ter

ter
i
ai
yer
live
somewhere
if
ye
do
know
where
it
is
an
i
do
live
nowhere
if

know
where

edna
smiled
at
this
why
she
said
where

your
father
and
mother
i
ai
got
none
mis
ryan
she
bound
me
out
to
mis
hawkins
an
i
ai

i
ai
she
starves
me
an
beats

and
the
child
voice
shrilled
out
again
i
ai
goin
ter
stay
i
ai
and
have
you
any
grandparents
or
aunts
or
uncles
the
child
shook
her
head
nor
i
think
maybe
you
have
a
like
my
aunt
elizabeth
continued
edna
but
another
shake
of
the
head
was
the
reply
and
you
have
any
friends
o
do
say
you
have
any
friends
urged
edna
a
pleased
look
coming
into
her
face
if
you
just
say
you
have
any
friends
i
know
just
what
to
do
there
moggins
said
the
child
who
is
moggins
edna
asked
her
face
falling
my
cat
mis
hawkins
wo
let
me
let
him
indoors
but
he
knows
me
an
comes
when
i
call
him
o
well
replied
edna
of
course
a
cat
is
a
friend
but
i
believe
he
count
anyhow
we
take
him
too
where
asked
the
girl
in
astonishment
why
to
the
home
of
the
friendless
of
course
are
you
friendless
and
you
have
any
home
it
just
the
place
made
for
you
and
edna
smiled
well
pleased
can
you
get
moggins
is
he
far
away
down
there
and
the
child
jerked
her
head
in
the
direction
of
a
narrow
court
near
by
i
wait
here
for
you
said
edna
decidedly
tell
me
your
name
and
i
tell
you
mine
i
edna
conway
i
maggie
horn
you
wait
for
me
and
maggie
darted
away
leaving
edna
on
the
corner
all
thoughts
of
the
ribbon
car
fare
and
all
else
faded
away
before
this
great
new
interest
the
saving
from
homelessness
and
friendlessness
this
little
street
child
whom
edna
had
met
in
such
an
unexpected
way
seemed
to
her
more
important
than
anything
else
in
the
world
and
she
eagerly
waited
maggie
return
she
did
not
have
to
wait
long
for
very
soon
maggie
came
running
back
with
a
forlorn
miserable
kitten
cuddled
up
in
her
arms
here
he
is
she
cried
exultantly
i
ketched
him
he
was
in
the
sun
let
hurry
so
mis
hawkins
wo
git
me
edna
patted
mogg
head
the
little
cat
looking
at
her
with
scared
eyes
until
he
was
reassured
by
maggie
coaxing
voice
ye
see
said
maggie
he
kinder
skeert
o
most
folks
they
tret
him
so
bad
the
way
i
come
to
git
him
was
when
annie
flynn
an
han
murphy
had
him
him
round
by
one
paw
and
then
flingin
him
off
ter
see
if
he
light
on
his
feet
one
of
his
legs
has
been
queer
ever
since
i

have
a
time
ter
keep
the
boys
from

to
the
place

edna

to
a
halt
looking
doubtfully
up
and
down
the
street
i
do
just
know
she
said
but
i
know
it
when
i
see
it
for
there
a
sign
over
the
door
with
for
friendless
children
on
it
ho
exclaimed
maggie
we
might
walk
all
day
in
this
big
place
and
then
not
get
there
if
i
had
lost
the
ten
cents
i
had
for
car
fare
we
might
ride
and
tell
the
conductor
to
let
us
off
when
we
got
there
said
edna
naïvely
maggie
laughed
she
was
sharper
than
edna
how
ye
know
which
car
to
take
that
so
was
the
reply
we
have
to
ask
a
policeman
no
no
cried
maggie
i
skeered
o
the
perlice
then
we
go
to
that
drug
store
and
ask
concluded
edna
wisely
and
with
childlike
confidence
she
turned
to
the
shop
in
question
the
of
the
friendless
said
the
clerk
with
a
smile
as
he
looked
at
the
queer
little
pair
let
me
see
i
can
soon
tell
you
and
he
turned
over
the
pages
of
a
big
book
on
the
counter
it
is
on
pearl
street
no
is
it
a
long
way
asked
edna
it
pretty
long
to
walk
you
better
ride
o
no
we
ca
we
walk
i
can
ca
you
maggie
sure
replied
maggie
forcibly
if
not
elegantly
thanking
the
clerk
who
gave
them
some
further
instructions
the
little
girls
started
out
on
their
journey
we
must
go
up
this
street
to
market
and
out
market
to
pearl
said
edna
and
they
trotted
along
chatting
as
if
the
proceeding
were
not
an
unusual
one
it
was
a
long
tiresome
walk
but
the
place
was
reached
at
last
and
edna
standing
on
tiptoe
rang
the
bell
which
was
answered
by
one
of
the
little
inmates
of
the
house
edna
smiled
as
she
recognized
one
of
the
children
she
had
seen
when
she
visited
the
place
with
her
aunt
o
how
do
you
do
she
said
i
have
brought
maggie
to
live
here
with
you
and
she
stepped
into
the
hall
followed
by
maggie
who
still
held
the
scraggy
little
kitten
hugged
close
the
child
who
opened
the
door
stared
i
go
call
miss
barnes
she
said
the
teacher
looked
a
little
curiously
at
the
visitors
but
edna
was
confident
of
a
welcome
i
brought
maggie
she
informed
the
lady
with
a
bright
smile
she
has
any
home
nor
any
friend
but
moggins
and
moggins
has
any
friends
but
her
so
you
know
that
why
they
both
had
to
come
but
my
dear
interrupted
miss
barnes
we
can
not
take
in
little
people
without
knowing
something
more
about
them
the
case

have
to
go
before
the
board
of
managers
and
then
if
it
is
all
right
be
very
glad
to
have
this
little
girl
the
board
meets
the
first
friday
in
each
month
edna
looked
distressedly
at
maggie
o
dear
she
sighed
and
come
such
a
long
way
and
we
so
hungry
at
least
i
am
i
expected
to
be
back
by
dinner
time
miss
barnes
was
looking
at
her
more
closely
why
she
exclaimed
are
you
the
little
girl
who
came
with
one
of
our
managers
not
long
ago

horner
niece

edna
did
you
know
me
i
knew

awfully

my
car
fare

we

little
child
said
miss
barnes
let
me
go
and
call
the
matron
and
we
talk
this
over
maggie
ca
go
back
decided
edna
she
would
be
beat
to
death
and
so
would
moggins
after
a
long
consultation
with
the
matron
and
innumerable
questions
it
was
arranged
that
maggie
should
remain
till
miss
barnes
had
seen
horner
and
moggins
too
stipulated
edna
but
the
matron
shook
her
head
then
i
have
to
take
him
home
with
me
said
edna
though
in
her
heart
she
had
many
misgivings
as
to
what
aunt
elizabeth
would
say
poor
little
maggie
stood
with
quivering
lips
as
she
saw
her
only
friends
depart
but
the
good
matron
set
before
her
a
generous
bowl
of
mush
and
milk
and
the
child
after
receiving
the
assurance
that
all
possible
should
be
done
for
her
accepted
matters
quietly
it
was
a
very
weary
little
girl
whom
miss
barnes
held
by
the
hand
as
the
two
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
house
opposite
the
square

edna
as
she
ushered
miss
barnes
into
the
and
having
brought
her
uncle
she
ran
to
get
something
to
eat
from
ellen
for
the
maid

saved
the
child
dinner
for
her
having
satisfied
her
appetite
and
having
heard
the
front
door
open
and
shut
edna
began
to
be
seized
with
fear
and
she
stood
tremblingly
by
the
door
as
she
heard
uncle
justus
approach
but
he
only
asked
have
you
had
some
dinner
little
girl
then
he
laid
his
hand
gently
on
her
head
and
walked
on
next

front
door
again
opened
and
edna
heard
aunt
elizabeth
voice
should

stay
or

fear
overcame
her
and
she
took
to
her
heels
never
resting
till
she
was
up
in
her
little
room
where
with
beating
heart
she
sat
at
the
window
overlooking
the
harbor
chapter
iv
maggie

a
long
time
edna
sat
at
the
window
expecting
every
moment
to
hear
her
aunt
heavy
tread
upon
the
stair
finally
from
sheer
exhaustion
the
little
dusky
head
drooped
on
the
sill

uncle

sitting
by
the

a
ruddy
glow
through
the
isinglass
of
the
stove
the
old
gentleman
was
slowly
polishing

his
silk

his
eyes

picture
of
sternness

only
upon
the
outer
edge
of
one
carefully
curled
gray
side
whisker
then
overcome
by
the
boldness
of
her
act
edna
fled
to
the
window
and
hid
herself
in
the
heavy
curtains
but
uncle
justus
understood
for
when
his
wife
came
into
the
room
he
said
edna
has
come
down
elizabeth
and
calling
her
to
him
he
actually
put
his
arm
around
the
shrinking
child
as
she
faltered
out
her
account
of
her
day
doings
while
she
felt
sure
he
meant
to
stand
her
friend
and
bravely
told
about
even
the
muddy
frock
i
am
sorry
auntie
she
said
i
did
mean
to
come
right
home
i
forgive
you
my
child
because
you
have
told
the
exact
truth
i
can
trust
you
because
you
are
truthful
perhaps
i
expected
too
much
of
you
sending
you
so
far
alone
was
the
reply
edna
could
hardly
believe
her
ears
to
hear
that
from
aunt
elizabeth
and
so
moggins
place
in
the
family
was
secure
he
grew
sleek
and
fat
under
ellen
care
and
was
a
great
source
of
amusement
to
edna
many
a
wild
play
they
had
together
in
the
big
yard
maggie
case
however
was
not
so
easily
settled
after
leaving
uncle
justus
miss
barnes
hurried
back
to
the
home
i
do
know
what
we
are
going
to
do
about
this
little
child
she
said
to
the
matron
we
can
not
keep
her
here
against
the
rules
of
the
institution
i
did
not
find
horner
at
home
and
so
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
to
take
the
child
back
to
the
people
with
whom
she
has
been
living
until
we
can
make
plans
for
her
but
maggie
upon
being
told
this
burst
into
a
perfect
frenzy
of
weeping
o
do
take
me
back
do
do
she
cried
she
will
beat
me
for
running
away
o
you
do
know
her
but
she
must
not
said
miss
barnes
she
can
be
arrested
for
you
you
do
know
her
repeated
maggie
she
will
beat
me
like
she
did
oncet
before
when
i
went
to
the
mission
school
an
some
ladies
give
me
clothes
she
took
away
an
said
i
was
settin
myself
up
to
be
a
lady
an
she
learn
me
she
would
an
she
beat
me
and
maggie
hid
her
face
at
the
recollection
an
when
the
ladies
came
to
see
about
me
she
continued
she
told
me
ef
i
dast
tell
do
worse
by
me
an
she
told
the
ladies
i
was
a
lyin
critter
an
purtended
i
was
ill
tret
when
she
was
a
mother
to
me
never
laid
the
flat
of
her
hand
agen
me
fur
my
good
maggie
had
been
standing
before
miss
barnes
and
the
matron
her
head
buried
in
her
arm
but
when
telling
this
tale
she
looked
with
tearful
eyes
straight
at
her
hearers
she
was
a
pitiful
looking
little
object
indeed
even
now
with
her
neglected
locks
smoothed
her
face
and
hands
washed
and
an
apron
covering
her
ragged
frock
for
she
was
thin
and
with
pallid
cheeks
and
bony
little
hands
which
worked
convulsively
as
she
told
her
story
what
shall
we
do
said
miss
barnes
her
heart
swelling
with
sympathy
the
matron
looked
thoughtful
i
ca
take
any
responsibility
in
the
matter
miss
barnes
she
replied
much
as
i
hate
to
turn
the
child
out
she
shall
not
go
back
returned
miss
barnes
with
emphasis
please
get
some
sort
of
a
hat
for
her
shaw
and
i
will
go
and
see
ramsey
it
is
a
case
that
needs
instant
attention
ramsey
was
the
wealthiest
and
most
influential
of
the
ladies
directly
interested
in
the
home
and
was
one
of
the
women
in
the
world
she
was
moreover
very
firm
and
decided
once
undertaking
a
matter
she
did
not
let
it
drop
till
she
had
accomplished
what
she
set
out
to
do
and
therefore
miss
barnes
was
wise
in
selecting
her
as
an
adviser
in
all
her
short
life
maggie
had
never
seen
such
magnificence
as
that
which
met
her
astonished
eyes
as
the
footman
in
livery
ushered
miss
barnes
and
her
charge
into
the
library
where
ramsey
was
sitting
the
child
gazed
at
pictures
and
ornaments
soft
draperies
and
luxurious
couches
feeling
as
if
this
were
the
court
of
a
queen
she
had
knocked
about
too
much
in
the
streets
to
be
very
shy
but
she
was
bewildered
by
all
that
she
saw
so
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
not
speaking
nor
even
listening
to
what
was
said
of
her
i
suppose
the
child
morals
are
far
from
good
miss
barnes
said
but
little
edna
conway
who
is
a
dear
child
seems
to
have
taken
a
fancy
to
this
poor
little
waif
and
miss
barnes
told
of
edna
trust
in
bringing
maggie
to
the
home
of
maggie
love
for
the
little
kitten
and
all
that
she
knew
of
the
child
from
her
own
story
she
must
have
some
good
in
her
said
ramsey
thoughtfully
anyhow
miss
barnes
she
is
a
poor
neglected
friendless
child
and
such
are
the
ones
for
whom
the
home
is
intended
she
sat
musingly
regarding
maggie
come
here
little
girl
she
said
presently
maggie
started
but
obediently
left
her
chair
and
stood
before
ramsey
who
looked
at
her
searchingly
how
old
are
you
she
asked
i
do
know
how
long
have
you
lived
with
this
woman
whom
you
have
just
left
i
do
know
ezackly
i
lived
with
mis
ryan
first
she
told
me
she
missed
my
mother
she
was
right
good
to
me
she
was
but
she
had
to
go
to
a
place
an
she
bound
me
out
to
mis
hawkins
to
look
after
the
young
uns
and
do
chores
mis
hawkins
is
a
hummer
a
what
she
a
out
an
outer
jus
drinks
an
fights
been
tuck
up
lots
of
times
so
you
ca
skeer
her
that
do
you

anything
about
your
mother
where
does
ryan
live
she
lives
to
a
place
in
the
country
she
tol
me
my
mother

mos
that
she
was
a
lady

the
millingnery
line
an
made
grand
bonnets
and
hats
and
your
mother
is
not
living
no
she
got
consumpted
and
died
mis
ryan
said
ramsey
again
sat
thinking
miss
barnes
she
said
after
a
pause
you
were
perfectly
right
it
would
not
do
for
you
to
take
the
responsibility
of
this
we
must
establish
our
legal
claim
to
this
child
i
do
not
imagine
it
will
be
difficult
you
may
leave
maggie
with
me
it
is
too
late
to
do
anything
this
evening
but
i
will
settle
the
question
and
maggie
found
herself
the
guest
of
it
seemed
to
her
the
most
elegant
lady
in
the
land
we
shall
see
you
again
at
the
home
maggie
said
miss
barnes
kindly
as
she
took
her
leave
be
a
good
girl
and
do
not
give
ramsey
any
trouble
she
is
more
than
kind
and
you
see
she
trusts
you
o
miss
barnes
i
would
do
nothin
to
trouble
that
beautiful
lady
for
nothin
no
not
for
nothin
promised
maggie
after
miss
barnes
had
gone
ramsey
summoned
a
maid
take
this
little
girl
and
give
her
a
good
bath
she
said
you
can
put
a
cot
in
your
room
for
her
she
is
to
sleep
here
and
she
is
to
go
out
with
me
we
will
have
to
manage
some
sort
of
an
outfit
for
her
i
think
you
will
have
to
go
out
early
rosa
and
do
some
shopping
for
her
are
you
hungry
maggie
she
asked
turning
to
the
child
no
i
was
but
i
had
a
big
bowl
of
mush
and
milk
what
shaw
give
me
you
had
better
give
her
something
more
rosa
mush
and
milk
is
not
a
very
lasting
diet
returned
ramsey
smiling
now
go
with
rosa
maggie
and
ramsey
turned
back
to
the
magazine
which
she
had
been
reading
when
miss
barnes
with
maggie
came
in
half
fearful
half
ecstatic
maggie
took
her
place
by
the
side
of
ramsey
in
her
fine
carriage
the
next
morning
rosa
had
clothed
her
in
an
entirely
new
suit
of
clothes
and
had
really
taken
pride
in
seeing
how
nice
she
could
make
her
little
charge
look
so
it
was
quite
a
little
girl
who
was
ramsey
companion
the
idea
of
riding
in
that
beautiful
carriage
nearly
took
maggie
breath
away
it
seemed
as
if
she
must
be
dreaming
but
as
she
neared
the
place
where
hawkins
lived
her
heart
fluttered
and
she
looked
up
so
appealingly
at
ramsey
that
the
eyes
of
the
sweet
woman
filled
no
one
shall
hurt
you
maggie
dear
she
said
and
she
held
the
child
hand
firmly
as
they
left
the
carriage
there
she
is
cried
maggie
clinging
closely
to
her
friend
as
a
woman
turned
toward
them
from
the
sidewalk
hawkins
was
no
respecter
of
persons
and
ramsey
appearance
with
maggie
was
the
signal
for
a
fierce
outbreak
there
ye
are
are
ye
callin
yerself
a
lady
maybe
children
i
have
the
law
on
ye
sure
as
me
name
hawkins
she
cried
the
child
left
you
of
her
own
accord
said
ramsey
with
dignity
then
ye
brought
her
back
have
ye
and
hawkins
cast
a
threatening
look
at
maggie
no
i
have
not
replied
ramsey
quietly
i
simply
brought
her
along
to
identify
you
ye
think
yer
honest
do
ye
shrieked
hawkins
i
have
the
child
back
i
the
law
on
me
side
we
shall
find
out
if
the
law
permits
anyone
to
retain
a
child
and
her
returned
ramsey
is
it
who
says
it
if
it
that
little
lyin
whinin
hush
said
ramsey
in
a
tone
of
command
the
woman
was
silenced
for
a
moment
then
she
made
a
grab
at
maggie
who
clung
to
her
protector
at
this
moment
up
strode
a
policeman
what
all
this
he
cried
what
the
trouble
pardon
me
madam
he
said
addressing
ramsey
that
lady
explained
the
policeman
looked
perplexed
i
am
not
sure
but
the
woman
has
some
right
madam
i
happen
to
know
that
the
child
belongs
here
but
you
can
probably
settle
it
if
she
has
been
you
had
better
leave
the
girl
here
and
consult
the
proper
authorities
hawkins
stood
with
her
arms
akimbo
looking
on
triumphantly
if
she
must
stay
so
must
i
said
ramsey
firmly
very
well
madam
i
will
see
that
you
are
protected
from
the
woman
said
the
policeman
ramsey
thanked
him
and
calling
her
coachman
she
bade
him
drive
directly
to
her
husband
office
then
she
took
up
her
place
in
a
little
shop
still
holding
maggie
by
the
hand
chapter
v
a
guilty
conscience
it
was
an
matter
ramsey
bravely
held
her
place
in
the
shop
gazed
at
by
curious
eyes
but
she
calmly
waited
the
return
of
her
carriage
with
her
husband
that
gentleman
appearance
with
two
officers
rather
took
down
hawkins
and
although
she
still
persisted
in
claiming
maggie
after
a
long
parley
and
a
visit
to
the
office
of
a
lawyer
the
matter
was
finally
settled
and
maggie
was
borne
triumphantly
away
and
handed
over
to
miss
barnes
if
there
ever
was
a
good
woman
whom
riches
can
not
spoil
it
is
ramsey
said
the
teacher
when
she
heard
maggie
account
of
her
day
you
ought
to
thank
god
for
such
a
friend
maggie
thus
maggie
was
established
in
her
new
home
she
felt
the
restraint
it
must
be
admitted
and
was
not
by
any
means
a
model
child
for
the
life
she
had
been
living
had
not
been
one
that
helped
her
to
much
goodness
but
she
had
very
strong
affections
and
a
grateful
heart
therefore
to
remind
her
that
ramsey
or
edna
would
be
disappointed
in
her
if
she
were
naughty
was
the
surest
means
of
bringing
penitence
for
a
fault
a
means
which
does
not
always
work
as
well
with
children
brought
up
in
a
purer
atmosphere
edna
had
occasion
to
learn
more
of
maggie
as
she
was
allowed
a
weekly
visit
to
the
home
to
see
her
little
friend
one
day
maggie
confessed
to
her
that
she
was
far
from
perfect
and
told
with
tears
in
her
eyes
of
obstinate
faults
but
i
will
be
good
i
try
ever
promised
the
child
for
miss
barnes
told
me
i
did
love
you
nor
ramsey
when
i
behave
bad
for
if
i
did
i
want
to
show
you
do
you
care
when
i
bad
she
asked
wistfully
of
course
i
do
replied
edna
what
had
you
been
doing
to
make
miss
barnes
say
that
maggie
was
silent
for
a
moment
there
a
little
girl
here
with
long
curls
she
awful
pretty
an
every
one
says
she
get
some
day
she
so
pretty
an
one
day
she
kicked
me
under
the
bench
when
some
ladies
was
here
an
an
i
pinched
her
an
the
ladies
saw
me
an
made
a
fuss
about
it
so
miss
barnes
sent
me
out
of
the
room
did
you
tell
on
her
asked
edna
no
i
did
i
like
you
for
that
she
replied
sympathizing
with
the
not
telling
for
her
loyal
little
heart
forbade
her
to
tell
on
louis
many
a
time
when
he
had
done
some
little
mean
trick
therefore
on
this
evening
of
her
visit
to
maggie
her
mind
was
full
of
such
things
i
would
let
a
poor
little
friendlesser
be
better
than
i
am
she
said
to
herself
and
i
be
twice
as
nice
to
louis
now
in
consequence
she
was
quite
disturbed
when
she
missed
her
cousin
from
the
supper
table
that
evening
why
where
is
louis
she
asked
he
is
in
his
room
replied
aunt
elizabeth
in
a
tone
which
forbade
further
questioning
edna
glanced
at
her
uncle
he
too
looked
stern
and
unyielding
and
no
chance
was
given
the
little
girl
that
evening
to
find
out
the
cause
of
louis
banishment
she
had
become
very
fond
of
her
cousin
although
she
did
not
always
quite
approve
of
him
he
was
a
gentle
affectionate
boy
easily
influenced
and
being
an
only
child
had
been
allowed
his
own
way
so
that
he
was
very
much
spoiled
he
was
nevertheless
a
very
agreeable
companion
for
a
little
girl
for
he
did
not
disdain
to
play
with
dolls
at
times
and
would
dress
up
and
play
lady
when
nothing
more
exciting
was
suggested
he
was
very
fond
of
keeping
shop
a
drug
store
he
usually
preferred
to
have
it
this
probably
on
account
of
the
very
small
pair
of
scales
among
his
toys
he
served
edna
and
the
dolls
a
certain
delectable
drink
made
by
filling
with
sugar
and
water
bottles
in
which
remained
a
few
drops
of
vanilla
extract
these
bottles
ellen
bestowed
upon
the
children
and
they
considered
the
mixture
they
prepared
something
very
delicious
the
rest
of
the
stock
consisted
chiefly
of
sand
dust
dried
beans
and
bits
of
broken
twigs
many
a
happy
hour
did
the
two
children
spend
playing
together
therefore
when
edna
felt
that
some
stern
decree
had
been
passed
upon
louis
her
little
tender
heart
felt
it
deeply
at
breakfast
time
no
louis
appeared
nor
did
he
take
his
place
in
school
that
day
to
his
question
what
is
the
matter
with
louis
edna
was
obliged
to
answer
i
do
know
after
dinner
which
seemed
a
more
solemn
affair
than
usual
the
little
girl
could
stand
it
no
longer
to
her
questions
ellen
could
give
no
satisfactory
answers
so
watching
an
opportunity
when
uncle
justus
was
taking
his
afternoon
nap
and
when
aunt
elizabeth
had
gone
to
some
meeting
edna
stole
up
to
the
storeroom
whose
window
was
diagonally
opposite
to
that
of
louis
room
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
tapped
on
the
window
there
was
no
response
from
louis
room
then
edna
decided
to
write
a
note
and
slip
it
under
his
door
this
she
managed
to
do
i
am
going
to
the
storeroom
open
your
window
was
what
she
wrote
and
the
note
served
its
purpose
for
when
the
storeroom
window
was
raised
there
stood
louis
before
his
window
o
louis
cried
edna
ca
you
get
out
no
was
the

o
dear
i
wish
you
could
i
have
such
a
lot
to
tell
you
what
are
you
shut
up
for
what
did
you
do
louis
looked
sullen
i
did
do
anything
o
said
edna
are
you
sure
then
why
did
they
shut
you
up
just
for
hatefulness
replied
louis
i
was
doing
a
thing
this
seemed
a
dreadful
state
of
affairs
and
edna
hardly
knew
what
to
think
i
wish
i
could
let
you
out
she
said
sympathetically
but
i
ca
louis
stood
with
downcast
eyes
hammering
with
his
knife
upon
the
sill
are
you
sure
you
have
done
anything
persisted
edna
of
course
i
have
they
just
want
to
show
their
power
over
me
and
i
am
half
starved
i
have
had
anything
but
bread
and
water
edna
eyes
filled
i
wish
i
had
something
nice
to
give
you
to
eat
she
said
in
distress
i
wish
you
had
replied
louis
o
i
hear
some
one
cried
edna
suddenly
and
she
shut
down
the
window
hastily
but
the
footsteps
proved
to
be
only
those
of
ellen
going
through
the
hall
edna
nevertheless
did
not
dare
to
venture
into
the
storeroom
again
at
once
for
uncle
justus
was
apt
any
minute
to
awaken
and
thinking
to
divert
louis
by
playing
with
moggins
in
the
yard
the
little
girl
went
out
and
tried
to
display
the
cat
to
the
boy
at
the
window
above
but
he
stood
watching
her
with
such
an
unsmiling
face
that
edna
was
overcome
with
pity
i
suppose
he
is
almost
starved
she
said
to
herself
it
likely
ellen
would
dare
to
give
me
anything
for
him
i
wish
i
had
some
pennies
but
i
have
given
them
all
to
auntie
for
the
fair
she
stood
pondering
over
the
subject
when
her
eye
caught
sight
of
a
covered
dish
standing
on
a
bench
by
the
kitchen
door
edna
lifted
the
cover
and
saw
that
the
dish
was
full
of
baked
apples
which
had
been
placed
there
to
cool
for
supper
without
stopping
to
think
she
picked
up
two
of
the
apples
by
their
stems
and
thrust
them
into
her
little
clean
handkerchief
which
still
unfolded
had
been
lying
in
her
pocket
holding
the
four
corners
of
the
handkerchief
together
she
ran
upstairs
to
the
storeroom
she
had
heard
uncle
justus
go
out
for
a
walk
and
she
knew
that
aunt
elizabeth
would
not
return
till
dark
in
response
to
the
raising
of
the
window
louis
window
also
opened
i
have
something
for
you
said
edna
hastily
but
i
do
know
how
to
get
it
to
you
it
in
my
handkerchief
wait
a
minute
she
had
an
idea
for
presently
out
of
the
window
came
a
rod
on
the
end
of
which
was
tied
the
handkerchief
of
baked
apples
exercising
much
care
edna
managed
to
direct
the
pole
which
was
the
handle
of
the
window
brush
to
louis
window
and
the
apples
were
taken
in
then
edna
drew
back
the
stick
set
it
up
in
its
place
and
ran
up
to
her
room
to
think
about
it
she
did
not
feel
comfortable
over
the
matter
only
a
short
time
ago
her
aunt
and
uncle
had
been
kinder
to
her
than
she
had
reason
to
expect
they
could
be
and
now
to
find
them
so
harsh
to
louis
seemed
a
contradiction
perhaps
he
had
been
naughty
and
deserved
the
punishment
she
remembered
with
regret
that
louis
did
not
always
speak
the
truth
once
or
twice
he
had
screened
himself
by
blaming
her
for
something
of
which
she
was
innocent
at
all
events
she
had
no
right
to
take
the
apples
why
they
did
belong
to
her
of
course
they
did
she
would
eat
any
for
supper
and
in
that
way
she
could
replace
them
edna
was
very
fond
of
baked
apples
and
the
sacrifice
decided
upon
she
felt
more
comfortable
so
at
supper
she
did
refuse
the
apples
an
unusual
proceeding
which
caused
her
aunt
to
look
at
her
so
sharply
that
edna
felt
those
penetrating
eyes
were
seeing
straight
into
her
very
heart
and
she
colored
up
taking
a
very
long
slow
drink
of
water
to
hide
her
embarrassment
she
was
very
quiet
all
during
the
evening
meekly
holding
some
worsted
for
her
aunt
then
taking
a
very
dull
book
and
trying
to
read
it
but
she
was
very
glad
when
bedtime
came
usually
it
was
a
very
few
minutes
after
her
head
touched
the
pillow
that
she
was
asleep
but
this
night
slumber
did
not
easily
come
and
the
pillow
was
very
damp
under
the
rosy
cheek
which
lay
upon
it
o
dear
sighed
the
child
it
did
do
a
bit
of
good
to
go
without
the
apples
i
ca
go
to
sleep
and
it
been
nearly
all
night
since
i
came
up
stairs
o
dear
what
shall
i
do
the
moments
became
harder
and
harder
to
bear
and
finally
with
but
one
thought
in
her
mind
she
slipped
out
of
bed
and
down
stairs
it
was
not
very
late
although
it
seemed
so
to
the
child
uncle
justus
and
aunt
elizabeth
were
still
in
the
they
were
surprised
by
the
appearance
of
a
little
form
standing
in
the
doorway
why
edna
what
are
you
doing
here
in
your
night
clothes
exclaimed
aunt
elizabeth
are
you
ill
no
replied
edna
below
her
breath
while
the
lump
in
her
throat
seemed
to
grow
bigger
and
bigger
after
the
first
glance
uncle
justus
eyes
did
not
turn
from
the
newspaper
he
was
reading
what
is
the
matter
then
asked
aunt
elizabeth
with
a
piercing
look
you
are
not
no
i
not
ill
aunt
elizabeth
replied
the
child
i
wicked
i
stoled
what
do
you
mean
what
was
it
you
took
asked
aunt
elizabeth
two
baked
apples
and
that
is
why
you
refused
them
at
supper
when
did
you
eat
them
i
did
eat
them
replied
edna
hesitatingly
o
please
auntie
i
wo
eat
any
the
next
time
either
please
shut
me
up
and
feed
me
on
bread
and
water
like
louis
did
you
take
the
apples
for
louis
suddenly
asked
uncle
justus
edna
gave
an
assenting
nod
while
she
looked
up
with
appealing
eyes
how
did
you
get
them
to
him
through
the
window
on
the
end
of
a
stick
a
little
queer
look
came
into
uncle
justus
face
you
will
take
cold
standing
there
said
aunt
elizabeth
returning
to
her
work
go
back
to
bed
wo
you
please
shut
me
up
and
let
louis
out
said
edna
i
stay
two
days
one
for
him
and
one
for
me
go
to
bed
commanded
aunt
elizabeth
we
settle
it
chapter
vi
the
fair
the
next
morning
saw
louis
free
and
he
appeared
at
the
breakfast
table
wearing
a
very
dogged
expression
of
discontent
edna
trembled
in
her
shoes
at
what
might
be
awaiting
her
and
when
her
aunt
called
her
solemnly
to
her
room
the
child
felt
as
if
she
were
going
before
a
dreadful
court
of
justice
she
never
forgot
that
talk
with
aunt
elizabeth
who
to
do
her
credit
tried
to
mete
out
what
she
considered
as
light
a
punishment
as
would
meet
the
case
it
was
not
the
punishment
which
edna
minded
it
was
the
long
talk
behind
locked
doors
which
she
bore
standing
in
front
of
her
aunt
whose
sharp
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
little
culprit
the
value
of
the
apples
is
a
very
small
matter
said
aunt
elizabeth
and
you
shall
replace
them
by
going
without
as
your
own
conscience
told
you
it
would
be
right
to
do
but
the
principle
of
the
thing
is
what
i
mind
even
though
you
took
the
fruit
for
some
one
else
you
were
not
only
breaking
the
commandment
shalt
not
steal
but
you
were
not
honoring
those
who
stand
in
the
place
of
your
father
and
mother
and
it
was
not
helping
louis
it
was
harming
him
for
your
uncle
and
i
knew
better
than
you
what
was
best
to
be
done
now
concluded
aunt
elizabeth
because
you
were
brave
enough
to
come
and
confess
your
fault
and
because
you
are
really
contrite
i
shall
not
punish
you
beyond
forbidding
you
all
sweets
for
a
week
edna
accepted
her
punishment
very
meekly
she
was
very
fond
of
sweets
and
it
was
hard
to
go
without
anything
of
that
kind
for
seven
whole
days
ellen
with
all
good
intentions
offered
her
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
spread
with
sugar
in
the
kitchen
one
day
but
the
child
was
too
honest
to
accept
it
and
it
is
quite
likely
that
this
stanch
upholding
of
her
aunt
decree
had
its
effect
not
only
upon
ellen
but
also
upon
louis
say
edna
said
the
boy
when
he
heard
the
result
of
the
affair
i
awfully
sorry
you
got
into
a
fuss
on
my
account
o
i
do
mind
it
much
replied
his
cousin
i
mind
having
uncle
justus
think
me
bad
louis
opened
his
eyes
you
do
care
what
that
old
tyrant
thinks
do
you
why
yes
was
the
reply
do
you
i
do
like
anybody
to
think
i
am
wicked
i
do
care
what
some
people
think
replied
louis
angrily
i
wish
my
father
and
mother
were
here
he
soon
see
whether
i
be
shut
up
again
just
because
i
chose
to
play
with
a
boy
they
did
know
run
away
next
time
see
if
i
do
was
that
it
returned
edna
but
you
know
they
said
we
must
make
friends
with
strange
children
did
you
make
friends
with
maggie
horn
answer
me
that
miss
exclaimed
louis
triumphantly
edna
was
silent
she
did
exactly
see
the
way
clear
to
defend
herself
although
she
knew
there
was
a
difference
somewhere
maggie
horn
is
nothing
but
a
dirty
little
street
child
continued
louis
and
i
have
the
least
doubt
but
that
she
tells
stories
and
steals
and
all
that
while
phil
blaney
lives
in
a
nice
house
and
and
as
if
that
made
him
good
answered
edna
scornfully
i
just
know
that
he
is
a
great
deal
worse
than
maggie
for
she
never
had
anyone
to
teach
her
and
phil
has
had
so
he
is
much
worse
he
is
not
replied
louis
fiercely
he
is
he
is
contradicted
edna
and
you
are
a
horrid
disagreeable
boy
to
talk
so
about
maggie
i
am
not
going
to
play
with
you
so
there
and
picking
up
her
doll
she
stalked
away
yah
yah
do
want
to
play
in
your
yard
sang
louis
after
her
edna
was
very
angry
the
more
so
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
defend
maggie
it
was
quite
likely
she
thought
that
maggie
might
do
all
sorts
of
wrong
things
and
it
was
also
quite
true
that
she
had
herself
made
friends
with
a
strange
girl
she
could
not
puzzle
it
out
and
she
went
down
stairs
to
the
where
uncle
justus
was
she
sat
down
on
a
hassock
by
the
fire
looking
very
thoughtful
once
or
twice
she
glanced
up
at
her
uncle
after
a
while
he
noticed
the
questioning
look
on
her
face
what
is
it
little
girl
he
asked
uncle
justus
she
said
was
i
very
bad
when
i
talked
to
maggie
horn
and
got
with
her
louis
says
it
was
just
as
bad
as
for
him
to
talk
to
phil
blaney
why
did
you
talk
to
maggie
and
make
her
acquaintance
i
was
so
sorry
for
her
replied
edna
simply
and
why
did
louis
become
intimate
with
phil
was
it
to
do
him
good
no
replied
edna
i
do
believe
he
thought
of
that
i
think
it
was
because
he
thought
phil
was
fun
and
did
you
think
about
disobeying
when
you
met
maggie
o
no
of
course
not
uncle
justus
you
do
think
i
meant
to
do
you
we
bumped
into
each
other
and
when
i
saw
how
poor
and
thin
she
was
i
felt
so
sorry
you
do
think
i
talked
to
her
because
i
wanted
not
to
mind
aunt
elizabeth
do
you
no
i
do
not
think
so
i
believe
all
your
thought
was
to
help
maggie
it
was
not
willful
disobedience
so
you
see
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two
cases
edna
was
thoughtful
yes
i
see
she
answered
but
somehow
that
feeling
sorry
for
people
made
her
get
over
her
anger
against
louis
and
she
went
up
stairs
singing
a
little
song
to
herself
and
a
half
hour
later
the
two
might
have
been
heard
laughing
merrily
over
their
play
and
planning
what
they
were
going
to
do
at
the
fair
which
was
to
be
held
the
next
week
before
then
edna
found
out
more
of
louis
misbehavior
it
seems
that
he
had
more
than
once
gone
out
the
back
gate
when
he
was
supposed
to
be
studying
his
lessons
in
the
afternoon
climbing
the
fence
and
creeping
in
the
house
again
just
at
dusk
being
encouraged
in
this
by
phil
blaney
uncle
justus
coming
home
later
than
usual
one
evening
caught
sight
of
louis
with
a
crowd
of
bad
boys
and
grimly
marched
his
nephew
home
phil
blaney
was
a
wild
uncontrolled
boy
who
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
street
played
truant
three
days
out
of
five
was
a
great
boaster
and
sneered
at
anything
like
goodness
he
was
vastly
amusing
however
and
generally
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
admiring
lads
who
thought
him
quite
a
hero
he
had
completely
fascinated
louis
who
was
blind
to
his
faults
and
attached
great
weight
to
every
word
he
uttered
phil
encouraged
the
younger
boy
to
be
as
defiant
as
possible
telling
him
he
was
a
coward
to
stand
being
badgered
by
old
as
he
called
professor
horner
so
louis
was
under
a
very
bad
influence
the
real
danger
of
which
neither
he
nor
edna
could
realize
the
next
week
however
the
fair
was
the
great
matter
of
interest
aunt
elizabeth
had
a
table
and
allowed
the
children
to
go
as
helpers
if
not
every
day
at
least
quite
often
louis
being
the
elder
was
sometimes
allowed
to
return
in
the
evening
and
edna
great
desire
was
to
be
allowed
also
to
go
at
that
time
it
is
much
more
fun
at
night
louis
had
told
her
there
are
so
many
people
there
and
it
is
all
lighted
up
and
there
is
always
music
singing
or
something
but
aunt
elizabeth
had
not
hinted
at
there
being
a
possibility
of
edna
being
allowed
to
sit
up
after
eight
and
edna
was
so
very
eager
to
go
just
one
evening
finally
she
summoned
up
courage
to
take
her
longing
to
uncle
justus
there
appeared
to
be
a
very
good
understanding
between
the
grave
dignified
man
and
the
honest
little
girl
and
the
confidences
between
the
two
grew
more
and
more
frequent
uncle
justus
was
in
the
large
schoolroom
looking
over
some
papers
when
edna
peeped
in
seeing
him
so
busy
she
crept
away
and
went
to
her
desk
in
the
adjoining
room
to
wait
till
he
should
be
free
after
a
while
she
heard
him
get
up
and
clear
his
throat
in
a
little
way
that
he
had
so
she
left
her
desk
and
reached
him
as
he
stood
looking
thoughtfully
out
of
the
window
uncle
justus
she
said
if
you
were
a
little
girl
my
size
and
there
were
a
fair
going
on
you
think
you
want
very
much
to
go
in
the
evening
the
queer
little
look
which
came
into
uncle
justus
face
when
such
questions
were
put
to
him
appeared
as
he
said
i
do
not
believe
i
could
imagine
the
feelings
of
a
little
girl
for
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
was
even
a
little
boy
for
a
moment
edna
imagination
tried
to
picture
uncle
justus
as
a
little
boy
but
it
was
such
a
very
difficult
thing
that
she
gave
it
up
almost
immediately
you
see
edna
went
on
i
do
believe
i
should
mind
about
most
fairs
but
this
is
such
a
particular
fair
you
know
it
is
to
get
a
new
house
for
maggie
and
the
rest
of
the
little
friendlesses
and
then
i
helped
to
make
some
of
the
pretty
things
and
i
do
want
to
hear
the
singing
and
see
how
it
looks
lighted
up
uncle
justus
smiled
it
was
not
a
very
fascinating
place
to
him
but
it
was
fairyland
to
the
little
girl
what
does
your
aunt
say
he
asked
she
does
say
anything
about
it
replied
edna
only
she
never
lets
me
sit
up
after
you
know
we
have
to
see
about
it
was
all
uncle
justus
said
but
it
was
quite
enough
for
edna
to
know
he
meant
to
put
in
a
word
for
her
and
indeed
that
very
evening
aunt
elizabeth
remarked
edna
if
you
study
your
lessons
faithfully
for
the
rest
of
the
week
you
may
go
to
the
fair
with
me
on
friday
evening
as
there
will
be
no
school
the
next
day
edna
clasped
her
hands
and
shot
a
pleased
look
at
uncle
justus
who
looked
at
her
over
the
top
of
his
spectacles
o
she
exclaimed
i
am
so
rejoiceful
even
aunt
elizabeth
smiled
at
that
and
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
lessons
were
given
unusual
attention
for
the
next
few
days
but
alas
when
friday
afternoon
came
aunt
elizabeth
was
laid
up
with
an
attack
of
neuralgia
and
there
was
no
hope
of
her
getting
to
the
fair
that
evening
such
a
disappointed
little
girl
never
was
the
great
splashed
down
her
cheeks
as
she
heard
the
decision
and
fled
to
her
room
o
dear
o
dear
she
said
i
do
see
why
it
had
to
be
friday
why
did
aunt
elizabeth
wait
just
one
more
day
something
poor
aunt
elizabeth
would
have
been
ready
enough
to
do
if
possible
it
did
seem
to
edna
as
if
she
could
not
stand
it
and
she
went
down
to
supper
with
very
red
eyes
louis
tried
to
comfort
her
and
promised
to
play
buttons
with
her
that
evening
a
specially
favorite
amusement
of
the
little
girl
when
aunt
elizabeth
allowed
her
button
bag
to
be
used
and
all
sorts
of
plays
were
invented
by
using
the
buttons
but
even
this
prospect
had
lost
its
charm
i
wish
i
were
a
man
exclaimed
louis
suddenly
i
take
you
uncle
justus
looked
up
quizzically
no
you
would
my
young
sir
he
replied
for
i
expect
to
give
myself
the
pleasure
of
taking
edna
to
the
fair
this
evening
down
went
edna
knife
and
fork
and
in
defiance
of
all
the
set
rules
of
the
house
she
jumped
up
from
her
seat
and
actually
hugged
uncle
justus
she
probably
would
not
have
done
so
if
aunt
elizabeth
had
been
present
but
that
restraining
presence
removed
the
children
both
felt
a
little
less
timid
it
did
not
take
edna
long
to
get
ready
and
such
a
rosy
beaming
face
as
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
must
have
given
uncle
justus
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
that
he
had
sacrificed
his
comfort
for
that
one
evening
for
the
old
gentleman
did
not
at
all
enjoy
going
to
fairs
and
would
have
preferred
to
spend
the
evening
over
his
papers
and
magazines
at
his
own
fireside
the
fair
rooms
truly
did
present
a
dazzling
scene
to
the
little
girl
and
she
was
enjoying
it
all
hugely
when
her
uncle
declared
himself
tired
and
told
her
to
run
about
a
little
while
and
come
back
to
him
when
she
had
seen
everything
she
had
not
gone
farther
than
the
second
booth
when
her
attention
was
caught
by
a
beautiful
large
doll
which
bore
a
card
saying
that
to
the
little
girl
who
should
receive
the
largest
number
of
votes
would
the
doll
be
given
what
do
you
think
of
it
asked
some
one
as
the
child
stood
absorbed
in
gazing
at
the
lovely
creature
before
her
edna
looked
up
at
her
side
stood
the
minister
of
the
church
to
which
she
went
every
sunday
with
her
aunt
and
uncle
i
think
it
is
perfectly
lovely
but
what
does
that
mean
exclaimed
she
what
the
card
it
means
that
a
wealthy
gentleman
bought
the
doll
and
having
no
little
girl
of
his
own
to
give
it
to
thought
this
would
be
a
nice
way
to
dispose
of
it
the
friends
of
some
little
girls
will
vote
for
them
and
the
one
who
has
the
greatest
number
of
votes
will
get
the
doll
now
i
suspect
you
wish
very
much
that
you
could
be
the
fortunate
little
girl
yes
i
do
replied
edna
candidly
only
i
have
very
many
friends
i
do
live
here
i
am
spending
the
winter
with
uncle
and
aunt
horner
o
yes
you
are
professor
horner
little
niece
now
let
me
see
perhaps
you
have
more
friends
here
than
you
imagine
suppose
i
were
to
try
to
get
some
votes
for
you
shall
i
edna
was
about
to
speak
when
a
sudden
thought
came
into
her
mind
for
a
moment
a
hard
struggle
went
on
she
did
love
dolls
but
she
had
several
and
she
stood
looking
soberly
at
the
one
before
her
while
the
minister
watched
her
what
is
it
little
one
he
asked
gently
edna
looked
up
wistfully
the
color
coming
and
going
in
her
face
i
was
thinking
she
said
o
wo
you
please
get
the
votes
for
maggie
horn
instead
of
me
i
do
believe
maggie
ever
had
a
doll
in
her
life
and
i
have
so
many
and
do
you
want
this
one
edna
was
silent
but
her
candor
always
prevailed
o
yes
but
maggie
would
be
so
perfectly
wild
over
it
and
you
see
she
one
of
the
little
friendlesses
and
this
is
her
fair
so
she
ought
to
have
it
she
said
in
a
moment
then
returned
the
minister
i
will
try
to
get
a
great
many
votes
for
her
and
your
name
is
edna
conway
i
must
go
back
to
uncle
justus
now
the
minister
took
her
by
the
hand
and
piloted
her
through
the
crowd
can
you
spare
me
your
little
girl
a
while
longer
professor
he
asked
uncle
justus
gave
a
willing
consent
and
when
edna
had
eaten
a
plate
of
ice
cream
had
heard
the
music
had
seen
the
lemonade
well
lighted
up
with
electric
lights
and
had
looked
at
pretty
things
till
she
was
tired
her
friend
took
her
back
to
uncle
justus
but
that
gentleman
sent
her
to
pick
out
a
cornucopia
from
aunt
elizabeth
table
and
she
was
made
happy
by
the
possession
of
the
one
which
she
had
always
especially
admired
it
was
shiny
white
with
little
bunches
of
flowers
over
it
and
the
picture
of
a
dear
little
girl
on
it
her
uncle
and
the
minister
were
in
earnest
conversation
when
she
returned
to
them
and
the
minister
parting
words
were
my
child
we
must
have
you
here
evening
to
hear
who
gets
the
doll
edna
was
so
tired
that
she
nearly
fell
asleep
on
the
way
home
but
she
felt
quite
when
they
reached
there
and
was
very
much
surprised
when
uncle
justus
bent
down
and
kissed
her
he
had
never
done
this
before
and
although
pleased
at
the
act
edna
wondered
why
he
did
it
and
she
went
up
stairs
also
wondering
who
would
get
that
lovely
doll
chapter
vii
where
the
doll
went
edna
awoke
still
wondering
of
course
she
realized
that
there
was
no
hope
of
her
going
to
the
fair
again
that
evening
for
she
had
been
up
until
ten
the
night
before
and
besides
aunt
elizabeth
would
not
be
well
enough
to
go
out
into
the
night
air
and
uncle
justus
could
not
be
expected
to
give
up
his
warm
corner
and
his
easy
chair
a
second
time
so
edna
contented
herself
with
dwelling
upon
the
delights
of
the
evening
before
and
wrote
a
long
account
of
it
to
sister
writing
to
her
sister
or
her
parents
was
one
of
her
regular
saturday
employments
the
letters
were
always
strictly
scrutinized
by
aunt
elizabeth
and
sometimes
had
to
be
written
all
over
again
edna
had
just
finished
her
letter
when
ellen
called
her
come
dear
there
a
lady
to
see
you
in
the
parlor
who
can
it
be
o
maybe
it
is
miss
atkins
my
teacher
shure
thin
it
not
replied
ellen
but
you
to
hurry
this
is
miss
martin
said
aunt
elizabeth
as
edna
entered
the
room
come
and
speak
to
her
you
know
who
i
am
do
you
said
miss
martin
drawing
the
little
girl
to
her
side
edna
did
know
you
are
our
minister
daughter
she
replied
yes
and
my
father
wants
you
to
come
and
take
tea
with
us
and
go
to
the
fair
afterward
to
find
out
about
that
wonderful
doll
you
know
this
is
the
last
evening
and
the
votes
are
to
be
counted
edna
looked
quickly
at
aunt
elizabeth
would
she
let
her
go
but
it
was
evident
that
miss
martin
invitation
was
not
to
be
set
aside
like
that
of
an
ordinary
person
and
edna
was
made
happy
by
hearing
her
aunt
say
martin
is
very
kind
my
niece
should
feel
very
much
favored
you
may
go
and
get
ready
edna
miss
martin
is
good
enough
to
say
that
she
will
wait
for
you
edna
scampered
up
stairs
as
fast
as
she
could
go
then
she
flew
down
to
the
kitchen
to
ask
ellen
help
the
maid
was
as
pleased
as
possible
over
the
pleasure
promised
her
favorite
and
she
made
ready
the
little
girl
with
all
the
speed
necessary
my
father
and
i
will
bring
edna
home
ourselves
said
miss
martin
i
am
so
sorry
horner
that
your
neuralgia
must
keep
you
at
home
but
we
hope
this
evening
to
bring
you
full
reports
of
our
success
martin
came
out
of
his
study
to
greet
edna
and
made
her
feel
at
home
at
once
by
telling
her
a
funny
story
about
the
big
dog
which
stalked
through
the
hall
and
sniffed
at
the
little
visitor
in
a
way
which
at
first
rather
scared
her
but
she
soon
found
he
meant
to
make
friends
with
her
so
she
was
quite
content
to
sit
with
his
big
head
in
her
lap
and
his
soft
brown
eyes
looking
up
at
her
while
martin
asked
about
her
own
pets
which
she
had
left
at
home
it
seemed
very
queer
to
sit
there
and
see
where
those
wise
sermons
were
made
which
the
minister
preached
from
the
pulpit
every
sunday
to
find
out
that
martin
was
as
full
of
fun
as
anyone
and
that
his
daughter
did
not
stand
in
awe
of
him
but
that
she
teased
him
at
supper
for
his
fondness
for
hot
buttered
cakes
i
shall
like
to
go
to
church
very
much
next
sunday
thought
edna
because
i
know
martin
and
have
seen
just
how
it
looks
here
when
he
is
writing
his
sermons
when
supper
was
over
no
time
was
lost
in
starting
for
the
fair
we
must
make
hay
while
the
sun
shines
said
martin
and
try
if
we
can
add
to
the
votes
we
already
have
o
exclaimed
edna
have
you
a
great
many
martin
is
there
any
chance
of
maggie
getting
the
doll
martin
smiled
that
is
telling
he
replied
but
you
will
know
pretty
soon
it
was
very
exciting
to
be
present
this
last
evening
of
the
fair
for
everyone
was
anxious
to
make
the
most
of
it
and
edna
thought
it
great
fun
to
watch
the
auctioneer
who
was
selling
off
some
of
the
larger
articles
she
was
intensely
interested
when
martin
began
bidding
on
a
set
of
books
and
was
quite
as
triumphant
as
he
was
when
they
were
knocked
down
to
him
but
all
other
interests
fell
flat
when
some
one
came
up
and
said
martin
they
are
going
to
count
the
votes
for
the
doll
edna
eyes
grew
big
and
she
could
scarcely
sit
still
from
anxiety
she
kept
craning
her
neck
to
see
if
anyone
were
coming
from
the
direction
of
that
special
booth
finally
she
was
rewarded
by
seeing
the
doll
delivered
into
the
hands
of
a
gentleman
who
made
his
way
toward
the
platform
there
was
another
little
girl
who
was
quite
as
eager
as
herself
edna
had
often
seen
her
in
church
and
knew
she
was
the
daughter
of
wealthy
parents
she
wore
very
pretty
dainty
clothes
and
edna
found
her
eyes
very
often
wandering
in
the
direction
of
this
little
girl
during
service
but
the
object
of
her
admiration
once
turned
and
made
a
face
at
edna
which
proceeding
shocked
her
very
much
i
would
do
that
in
church
she
said
to
herself
i
do
care
if
she
is
rich
and
comes
in
that
shining
carriage
she
is
not
a
nice
little
girl
i
like
maggie
horn
much
better
therefore
it
was
a
very
thrilling
moment
when
the
gentleman
holding
the
doll
mounted
the
stand
and
said
i
have
here
a
very
popular
young
lady
she
comes
from
tuttle
booth
and
has
received
so
many
votes
that
she
must
be
quite
anxious
herself
as
to
her
future
then
reading
from
a
paper
he
said
i
will
only
announce
the
two
candidates
who
have
received
the
greatest
number
of
votes
clara
adams
one
hundred
and
edna
conway
the
little
heart
stood
still
and
she
clasped
miss
martin
hand
convulsively
while
she
looked
at
her
with
something
like
reproach
in
behalf
of
maggie
horn
continued
the
gentleman
three
hundred
and
one
votes
there
was
silence
a
moment
i
want
to
say
the
gentleman
went
on
that
the
little
girl
whose
representative
i
hope
is
here
is
one
of
the
inmates
of
the
home
of
the
friendless
rescued
from
a
pitifully
unhappy
life
by
edna
conway
who
has
also
been
the
means
of
procuring
for
the
little
girl
no
longer
friendless
this
beautiful
doll
will
miss
edna
conway
please
come
forward
growing
red
and
white
by
turns
glad
fearful
ashamed
all
at
once
edna
went
to
the
platform
amid
tremendous
applause
every
eye
was
turned
upon
her
and
she
felt
in
this
conspicuous
position
as
if
she
should
sink
through
the
floor
into
her
hands
the
lovely
doll
was
given
and
then
the
gentleman
detained
her
by
saying
one
moment
my
dear
the
ladies
of
the
fair
want
you
to
accept
this
little
basket
of
flowers
with
their
love
and
a
basket
of
exquisite
roses
was
handed
down
edna
hardly
knew
how
she
got
back
to
miss
martin
side
but
when
she
did
reach
there
the
doll
was
laid
upon
the
bench
the
flowers
were
handed
to
martin
and
the
little
child
hid
her
face
on
her
friend
shoulder
overcome
by
the
situation
we
better
go
now
said
miss
martin
in
a
low
voice
as
she
saw
a
body
of
girls
ready
to
pounce
upon
edna
with
hugs
and
kisses
i
am
sure
horner
would
not
like
this
fuss
over
her
niece
she
continued
to
her
father
and
edna
was
quite
ready
to
leave
not
liking
herself
to
be
fussed
over
miss
martin
and
her
father
only
stopped
to
see
their
little
charge
safe
in
the
hands
of
her
aunt
and
uncle
and
with
many
thanks
edna
bade
them
a
fervent
in
her
delight
she
entered
the
forgetting
to
be
a
little
girl
that
should
be
seen
and
not
heard
o
uncle
justus
she
cried
see
see
the
doll
for
maggie
and
look
at
my
flowers

so
loud

reproved
aunt
elizabeth
let
me
see
yes
the
doll
is
very
pretty
and
where
did
you
get
your
flowers
illustration
why
returned
edna
innocently
the
man
said
that
the
ladies
of
the
fair
gave
them
to
me
with
their
love
and
i
do
know
why
for
i
did
get
a
single
vote
but
yours
and
uncle
justus
aunt
elizabeth
smiled
but
she
did
not
explain
well
child
she
said
it
was
very
kind
of
the
ladies
to
pay
the
compliment
to
martin
little
guest
o
yes
replied
edna
of
course
it
was
and
he
liked
it
too
i
wish
i
had
given
him
and
miss
martin
more
of
the
roses

had
better
put
them
in
water
or
they
will
all
fade
said
aunt
elizabeth

have
no
doubt

ladies

remember

to
bed
and
try
to
get
up
when

called

to

please
tell
me
when
i
can
take
maggie
her
doll
i
am
afraid
i
shall
not
be
able
to
go
with
you
on
monday
for
i
have
a
meeting
in
the
afternoon
answered
aunt
elizabeth
could
you
find
your
way
alone
asked
uncle
justus
i
think
perhaps
i
could
replied
edna
a
little
doubtfully
but
i
am
not
very
good
at
finding
my
way
about
papa
says
my
bump
of
locality
was
left
out
i
do
know
what
that
means
but
he
said
so
perhaps
if
i
put
you
on
the
cars
and
tell
the
conductor
to
let
you
out
at
pearl
street
you
could
find
your
way
said
uncle
justus
and
what
about
the
getting
back
put
in
aunt
elizabeth
i
think
edna
will
have
to
wait
but
here
again
miss
martin
came
to
her
aid
for
the
next
morning
after
she
made
her
way
over
to
where
edna
was
standing
waiting
for
louis
and
asked
her
about
the
matter
i
ca
go
till
tuesday
edna
told
her
for
aunt
elizabeth
time
to
take
me
and
i
do
so
want
maggie
to
have
her
doll
wo
she
be
miss
martin
i
am
just
crazy
to
take
it
to
her
let
me
see
returned
miss
martin
thoughtfully
if
your
aunt
will
allow
you
to
go
perhaps
i
can
take
you
how
would
that
do
i
will
see
horner
after
church
and
we
try
and
arrange
it
and
so
it
was
settled
that
edna
should
go
with
miss
martin
to
the
home
the
next
afternoon
in
the
meantime
it
was
a
great
temptation
to
have
the
pretty
doll
so
near
and
not
resist
the
temptation
of
being
a
little
envious
of
it
many
a
peep
was
taken
at
the
fine
lady
laid
away
in
state
in
one
of
edna
bureau
drawers
but
the
child
was
honorable
enough
not
to
run
the
risk
of
spoiling
the
freshness
of
her
attire
by
taking
her
out
of
her
place
i
think
you
were
a
goose
not
to
try
for
the
doll
yourself
said
louis
o
louis
replied
edna
i
never
could
have
had
all
those
votes
and
besides
i
have
moggins
so
you
see
i
ought
to
make
up
to
maggie
for
that
well
that
so
replied
louis
anyhow
i
am
glad
that
that
clara
adams
did
not
get
her
edna
was
thoughtful
so
am
i
she
confessed
but
she
added
i
heard
miss
martin
say
clara
adams
i
very
sorry
for
that
child
poor
exclaimed
louis
i
do
know
where
you
get
your
rich
people
from
if
she
poor
i
reckon
miss
martin
does
know
what
talking
about
i
going
to
ask
her
declared
edna
and
true
to
her
word
she
did
ask
that
very
afternoon
what
made
you
say
clara
adams
miss
martin
did
i
say
that
well
dear
she
is
a
very
poor
little
girl
with
all
her
rich
clothes
and
her
ornaments
there
is
one
ornament
which
i
am
afraid
she
will
never
be
able
to
wear
edna
opened
her
eyes
what
is
it
miss
martin
she
asked
wondering
if
clara
were
in
any
way
deformed
so
she
could
not
wear
rings
miss
martin
smiled
did
you
never
hear
about
the
ornament
of
a
meek
and
quiet
spirit
she
said
o
returned
edna
only
half
understanding
clara
is
a
restless
discontented
envious
little
girl
continued
miss
martin
and
although
her
mother
and
father
come
to
church
every
sunday
and
give
liberally
to
charities
their
little
girl
is
not
taught
to
find
happiness
by
thinking
of
others
rather
than
of
herself
and
so
that
poor
little
self
of
hers
often
feels
as
much
neglected
as
maggie
horn
ever
did
but
clara
is
neglected
interposed
edna
she
thinks
she
is
unless
some
one
is
paying
attention
to
her
all
the
time
she
wants
to
be
noticed
and
considered
and
amused
from
morning
till
night
and
feels
slighted
at
being
set
aside
for
a
single
instant
so
you
see
she
is
a
little
girl
to
be
pitied
is
better
than
wealth
says
the
old
proverb
that
was
a
new
way
to
look
at
clara
adams
edna
reflected
but
she
had
not
time
then
to
think
much
of
the
matter
for
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
home
where
maggie
was
this
was
not
visitors
day
but
a
note
from
horner
to
miss
barnes
gave
edna
special
permission
to
see
maggie
she
came
into
the
room
looking
very
clean
and
neat
in
her
blue
dress
and
gingham
apron
her
face
brightened
as
she
caught
sight
of
edna
why
she
exclaimed
how
did
you
happen
to
come
how
is
moggins
i
hope
he
does
bother
your
aunt
moggins
is
as
fat
as
butter
answered
edna
and
i
came
o
maggie
i
came
to
bring
you
this
and
she
thrust
the
doll
into
the
little
girl
arms
maggie
looked
from
the
doll
to
edna
and
back
again
perfectly
bewildered
why
why
she
said
not
for
me
you
do
mean
for
me
edna
nodded
yes
most
decidedly
it
for
you
and
came
from
the
fair
o
so
many
people
voted
for
her
three
hundred
is
she
sweet
o
o
cried
maggie
i
never
had
nothin
like
this
i
never
expected
nothin
like
it
i
feel
like
it
was
christmas
an
i
was
an
it
was
a
story
book
all
to
once
i
kiss
you
why
of
course
replied
edna
heartily
and
she
threw
her
arms
around
the
little
girl
and
gave
her
a
fervent
embrace
then
followed
a
close
examination
of
the
dolly
pretty
clothes
by
both
little
girls
till
miss
martin
came
in
accompanied
by
miss
barnes
who
said
she
was
sorry
to
take
maggie
away
but
that
it
was
study
hour
and
the
children
separated
one
about
as
happy
as
the
other
then
edna
and
her
friend
turned
toward
home
where
a
new
surprise
was
awaiting
chapter
viii
a
peck
of
trouble
where
is
uncle
was
edna
first
question
when
she
reached
home
listen
to
the
dear
replied
ellen
she
does
know
that
the
two
of
them
has
gone
away
suddint
why
where
asked
edna
in
astonishment
to
horner
sisther
darlin
wurred
came
by
the
bhy
from
the
telegraph
office
thot
the
poor
leddy
low
and
would
they
come
right
away
so
the
madam
a
bit
o
their
clothes
intil
a
bag
an
says
she
we
be
back
the
mornin
ye
must
look
out
for
the
childer
o
cried
edna
then
we
can
eat
supper
in
the
kitchen
and
let
me
pour
out
wo
you
will
i
thin
av
coorse
i
will
an
i
make
ye
a
bit
o
short
cake
o
that
will
be
fine
replied
edna
i
going
up
stairs
to
take
off
my
wraps
and
then
i
coming
down
into
the
kitchen
moind
ye
change
yer
dhress
called
ellen
an
put
on
an
apron
so
ye
not
get
yer
clothes
hurted
edna
was
down
again
in
a
twinkling
the
cause
of
the
sudden
departure
of
her
uncle
and
aunt
lost
sight
of
in
this
happening
of
a
cosy
time
illustration
moggins
there
was
something
particularly
cheery
and
comfortable
about
the
clean
kitchen
louis
was
already
there
playing
with
moggins
the
little
kitty
was
whisking
around
after
a
string
his
prancings
and
sidewise
jumps
making
the
children
laugh
merrily
edna
left
this
play
to
make
a
little
short
cake
from
some
dough
which
ellen
gave
her
she
baked
it
on
top
of
the
stove
and
although
it
was
neither
very
clean
nor
well
baked
and
was
rather
ragged
looking
it
was
heartily
enjoyed
by
the
children
and
moggins
who
was
a
little
cat
ready
to
taste
anything
offered
to
him
edna
poured
out
the
cambric
tea
and
mixed
it
with
great
gravity
giving
louis
plenty
of
sugar
in
his
while
the
amount
of
short
cake
and
syrup
indulged
in
would
have
been
considered
shocking
by
aunt
elizabeth
but
the
children
had
never
so
enjoyed
a
meal
in
that
house
edna
doll
ada
occupied
a
place
at
the
table
being
mounted
upon
a
firkin
placed
upon
a
chair
and
as
edna
had
to
eat
both
her
own
and
her
doll
share
of
the
short
cake
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
supply
was
more
than
she
could
manage
louis
took
moggins
under
his
care
but
moggins
it
must
be
confessed
did
not
behave
so
well
as
ada
for
he
slyly
whipped
off
with
his
paw
pieces
of
food
from
louis
fork
and
began
lapping
the
cambric
tea
from
his
neighbor
cup
so
finally
he
was
sent
from
the
table
a
disgrace
which
did
not
affect
him
in
the
least
as
it
gave
him
a
chance
to
scamper
around
after
his
tail
and
race
about
without
restraint
o
louis
said
edna
when
bedtime
came
are
you
afraid
to
sleep
down
here
alone
louis
flushed
up
what
did
you
say
that
for
he
replied
i
going
to
think
about
it
and
now
you
made
me
i
not
exactly
afraid
but
it
is
a
long
way
up
to
you
and
ellen
if
anything
should
happen
ellen
stood
thoughtfully
considering
the
question
one
hand
on
her
hip
and
the
other
stroking
her
lips
thrue
for
ye
she
said
i
promised
the
mistress
to
hev
an
eye
on
ye
an
how
can
an
eye
pinitrate
through
the
two
flures
i
bring
a
cot
down
for
mesilf
to
your
aunt
room
an
edna
shall
sleep
in
the
big
bed
whilst
i
take
the
cot
so
we
all
be
commojus
and
neighborlylike
there
was
much
fun
and
laughter
getting
the
cot
down
stairs
and
edna
thought
it
a
great
experience
to
sleep
in
her
aunt
big
bed
while
louis
was
very
glad
not
to
be
so
far
removed
from
the
others
although
he
professed
great
indifference
upon
the
subject
after
his
first
confession
the
next
morning
the
school
children
began
to
gather
nine
came
and
no
teacher
for
strange
to
say
even
miss
ashurst
did
not
make
her
appearance
a
note
from
her
did
arrive
but
as
it
was
addressed
to
professor
horner
no
one
opened
it
and
the
cause
of
her
absence
was
not
explained
o
fun
cried
one
of
the
girls
no
school
we
have
a
holiday
we
better
wait
a
little
while
said
agnes
evans
who
was
the
eldest
as
well
as
the
brightest
pupil
in
the
school
professor
and
horner
may
come
in
any
minute
we
wait
till
ten
come
here
little
sobersides
she
said
to
edna
what
are
you
so
solemn
about
what
word
did
your
aunt
and
uncle
leave
they
left
word
that
they
would
be
back
this
morning
replied
edna
of
course
they
supposed
miss
ashurst
would
be
here
and
that
she
would
be
able
to
get
along
till
they
came
do
you
think
and
edna
looked
up
hesitatingly
what
monkey
dear
said
agnes
passing
her
arm
around
the
child
out
with
it
do
you
think
we
might
have
school
just
the
same
if
you
big
girls
were
to
take
the
teachers
places
do
you
think
we
ought
to
try
to
do
the
best
we
can
you
dear
child
responded
agnes
the
idea
of
your
having
more
conscience
than
us
big
girls
of
course
that
is
what
we
should
do
miss
ashurst
has
been
absent
once
or
twice
before
and
one
of
us
has
always
taken
charge
of
the
little
girls
helen
darby
come
here
she
called
to
one
of
her
classmates
will
you
take
charge
of
the
little
girls
we
going
to
be
good
and
have
school
the
best
way
we
can
find
florence
gittings
and
see
if
she
undertake
the
boys
she
be
just
the
one
to
manage
them
and
springing
forward
to
professor
horner
desk
agnes
rapped
sharply
the
girls
who
had
been
chattering
like
magpies
suddenly
became
silent
girls
said
agnes
how
many
of
you
will
stand
by
me
and
do
their
best
this
little
midget
has
made
me
ashamed
of
myself
by
telling
me
my
duty
and
i
do
my
best
to
teach
those
in
this
room
anyone
who
ca
trust
to
my
judgment
can
go
home
immediately
and
any
girl
who
ca
promise
to
behave
just
as
well
as
if
the
professor
were
here
can
also
go
home
not
a
girl
left
the
room
good
cried
agnes
now
let
us
go
to
work
and
school
was
opened
without
further
delay
agnes
conscientiously
kept
strictly
to
the
order
of
the
day
as
mapped
out
by
professor
horner
and
the
girls
with
good
will
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
occasion
you
are
on
your
honor
girls
agnes
told
them
and
i
do
believe
there
is
one
here
mean
enough
to
slight
her
work
so
even
the
most
careless
tried
to
keep
up
to
the
standard
set
for
her
while
the
bright
young
teacher
made
everything
as
interesting
as
possible
florence
gittings
managed
the
little
boys
fairly
well
and
helen
darby
did
her
best
with
the
little
girls
the
latter
however
belonged
to
the
most
troublesome
class
and
edna
felt
very
much
ashamed
of
some
of
them
o
dear
she
said
to
miss
evans
our
class
did
behave
well
at
all
and
it
will
have
to
be
reported
to
uncle
justus
you
dear
thing
replied
agnes
you
shall
be
reported
for
good
behavior
i
can
tell
you
i
shall
just
tell
your
uncle
what
a
dear
little
soul
you
were
and
how
you
really
were
the
one
who
started
the
plan
of
our
day
doings
edna
blushed
at
the
praise
she
was
not
often
commended
by
aunt
elizabeth
who
did
not
believe
in
praising
children
and
so
the
little
girl
was
very
grateful
for
this
if
anything
happens
to
detain
our
teachers
girls
said
agnes
at
parting
we
shall
do
just
as
well
i
hope
so
please
all
put
in
an
appearance
dinner
was
not
served
in
the
kitchen
and
the
two
children
ate
their
meal
feeling
a
little
forlorn
at
being
so
long
left
to
themselves
it
was
very
well
for
a
time
but
as
the
day
wore
on
edna
missed
uncle
justus
from
his
place
in
his
easy
chair
missed
aunt
elizabeth
heavy
tread
and
told
louis
she
did
ho
that
just
like
a
girl
he
said
i
do
miss
them
that
way
i
can
tell
you
i
glad
enough
to
get
a
chance
to
have
a
fling
i
know
what
i
going
to
do
this
afternoon
what
asked
edna
i
going
to
have
a
lot
of
the
boys
in
and
have
some
fun
o
exclaimed
his
cousin
with
round
eyes
of
disapproval
why
should
i
asked
louis
sharply
i
guess
i
have
a
right
to
do
as
i
choose
when
there
nobody
here
to
tell
me
i
edna
could
not
always
answer
louis
arguments
but
she
knew
it
would
be
against
the
wishes
of
her
aunt
and
uncle
i
would
do
it
she
said
o
no
would
good
little
baby
girl
you
too
much
of
a
saint
i
suppose
you
tattle
too
the
tears
came
into
edna
eyes
now
louis
you
know
i
never
tell
on
you
well
no
you
do
but
if
you
so
down
on
a
fellow
having
any
fun
what
he
to
expect
i
not
down
on
your
having
fun
but
i
think
we
ought
to
do
just
as
well
as
we
can
while
uncle
and
aunt
are
away
better
even
for
it
seems
sort
of
sort
of
dishonest
to
do
things
behind
people
backs
that
you
would
do
before
their
faces
do
you
mean
to
say
i
am
dishonest
began
louis
blustering
o
no
cried
edna
but
but
humph
i
do
believe
you
know
what
you
do
mean
now
see
here
my
father
and
mother
ai
wicked
people
are
they
of
course
not
well
then
if
they
let
me
have
boys
to
come
in
and
play
with
me
at
home
why
is
it
just
as
right
here
answer
me
that
edna
could
not
answer
so
she
got
up
and
walked
away
louis
calling
after
her
you
need
have
anything
to
do
with
it
miss
i
do
suppose
the
boys
will
insist
upon
your
playing
with
them
and
a
moment
after
edna
heard
him
go
out
of
the
house
about
a
half
hour
later
she
heard
him
return
a
troop
of
boys
following
him
they
clattered
into
the
house
and
up
into
the
schoolroom
ellen
hearing
the
noise
went
up
but
as
might
have
been
expected
the
boys
only
jeered
at
her
and
paid
no
attention
to
what
she
said
masther
louis
must
study
his
lessons
she
told
them

louis

and
tend
to
your
business
we
not
going
to
do
any
harm
and
ellen
after
standing
helplessly
looking
at
them
for
a
moment
went
back
to
her
work
will
she
tell
on
you
louis
asked
the
boys
i
do
care
if
she
does

he
if
they
make
a
fuss
i
know
what
i
can
do

phil
blaney
of
course

make
your
way
to
california
where
your
father
and
mother

a
fine
time

a
whack
at
the
indians
that
what
i
like
to
do
you
no
baby
to
be
ordered

a
little
girl
and
a
servant

returned
louis
feeling
very
big
they
better
try
bossing
me
i
let
know
they
ca
do
it
the
boys
play
became
more
and
more
boisterous
as
time
went
on
the
schoolroom
presented
a
fine
field
for
sport
and
edna
in
her
room
above
trembled
as
now
and
then
came
a
crash
which
made
her
jump
o
my
she
exclaimed
i
hope
they
wo
go
to
uncle
chemical
closet
i
so
afraid
they
will
and
indeed
the
boys
were
bent
on
investigating
everything
with
the
intention
of
putting
all
in
order
before
they
left
but
in
the
midst
of
the
din
came
a
sudden
quiet
edna
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
she
ran
down
stairs
and
peeped
in
the
room
in
flinging
a
book
across
the
room
one
of
the
boys
had
upset
a
bottle
of
ink
the
contents
of
which
spattered
floor
and
wall
the
boys
were
busy
mopping
it
up
you
can
say
the
cat
got
up
here
and
did
it
phil
blaney
was
saying
no
he
cried
edna
from
the
door
ready
to
defend
moggins
the
boys
all
stopped
and
looked
fearfully
around
o
it
only
louis
cousin
she
wo
tell
will
you
edna
i
let
moggins
be
blamed
when
he
ca
speak
for
himself
she
replied
firmly
although
she
was
scared
if
you
dare
to
tell
began
phil
coming
up
to
her
threateningly
i
i
make
it
worse
for
you
edna
grew
very
pale
she
was
afraid
of
this
big
boastful
boy
but
she
did
not
flinch
say
will
you
tell
demanded
phil
seizing
her
by
the
wrist
louis
sprang
forward
look
out
he
cried
let
my
cousin
alone
will
you
do
you
dare
to
touch
her
phil
turned
on
him
the
other
boys
standing
off
you
want
to
fight
do
you
cried
phil
with
a
swagger
louis
eyes
flashed
and
he
made
a
step
forward
to
wrench
phil
hold
from
edna
wrist
o
do
louis
do
cried
the
little
girl
making
an
effort
and
freeing
herself
to
fling
her
arms
around
her
cousin
come
on
boys
called
phil
do
let
these
youngsters
down
me
the
boys
stood
a
little
uncertain
till
charlie
stabler
who
had
been
out
of
the
room
to
get
some
water
returned
ah
let
them
alone
he
said
louis
is
littler
than
you
phil
i
do
care
replied
he
i
thrash
him
if
edna
does
not
promise
not
to
tell
poor
little
edna
she
trembled
from
head
to
foot
louis
had
befriended
her
and
now
to
choose
between
him
and
moggins
what
was
she
to
do
but
her
courage
came
to
her
rescue
you
a
coward
she
cried
again
phil
made
a
dive
at
her
but
charlie
stabler
leading
the
other
boys
arose
to
the
occasion
and
made
a
rush
forward
so
that
the
little
girl
found
herself
in
the
midst
of
the
group
let
her
alone
cried
louis
i
sha
cried
phil
and
the
confusion
arose
higher
and
higher
but
suddenly
a
hush
fell
upon
everyone
and
looking
up
edna
saw
uncle
justus
standing
in
the
doorway
chapter
ix
about
several
things
it
seemed
to
edna
as
she
looked
up
that
she
had
never
seen
uncle
justus
eyebrows
appear
so
shaggy
nor
his
eyes
snap
so
boys
he
thundered
out
leave
the
house
every
one
slunk
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
without
a
word
edna
he
said
when
the
last
one
had
left
go
to
your
room
i
thought
i
could
trust
you
he
added
come
with
me
louis
edna
crept
up
stairs
her
bosom
heaving
and
such
a
hurt
dreadful
feeling
in
her
heart
it
was
so
terrible
to
be
judged
in
that
way
as
if
she
had
taken
part
in
all
that
disorder
she
felt
as
if
she
could
not
stand
it
but
there
was
no
room
left
for
explanation
and
she
cried
as
if
her
heart
would
break
over
this
dreadful
condition
of
things
it
was
not
long
however
before
she
heard
some
one
coming
up
stairs
edna
my
child
where
are
you
a
voice
said
quite
gently
your
uncle
did
understand
she
heard
aunt
elizabeth
say
he
is
very
sorry
he
blamed
you
unjustly
one
of
the
boys
charlie
stabler
has
been
here
to
acknowledge
his
part
in
the
affair
and
to
offer
to
pay
for
any
damage
done
he
is
a
very
manly
boy
although
he
did
not
do
quite
right
to
join
the
others
he
has
also
said
that
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
trouble
and
has
told
of
louis
defense
of
you
which
in
some
degree
lessens
the
fault
edna
jumped
up
and
threw
her
arms
around
her
aunt
o
auntie
she
cried
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
back
aunt
elizabeth
smiled
and
bade
edna
bathe
her
face
and
go
down
and
see
her
uncle
who
was
waiting
for
her
uncle
justus
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
opened
his
arms
as
his
little
niece
came
down
and
as
he
held
her
closely
she
knew
he
meant
to
make
amends
for
the
harsh
judgment
how
is
your
sick
sister
asked
the
little
girl
she
is
better
a
little
better
but
still
very
ill
replied
uncle
justus
i
am
so
glad
she
is
better
returned
edna
and
you
wo
have
to
go
away
again
will
you
i
hope
not
you
had
a
hard
time
getting
along
did
you
we
did
at
first
acknowledged
edna
truthfully
we
had
fun
but
it
has
been
just
horrid
why
did
you
come
back
this
morning
uncle
we
missed
the
train
there
are
only
two
trains
a
day
from
that
junction
and
something
happened
to
the
carriage
on
the
way
so
we
were
too
late
for
the
morning
train
you
did
have
school
of
course
i
found
miss
ashurst
note
when
i
reached
here
she
has
an
attack
of
grippe
o
yes
we
did
have
school
i
am
sorry
uncle
but
the
little
girls
were
as
good
as
the
others
and
you
are
one
of
the
little
girls
returned
uncle
justus
smiling
and
looking
down
at
her
but
edna
felt
that
whatever
he
might
hear
of
the
rest
he
would
not
include
her
with
the
number
of
those
who
had
misbehaved
that
he
was
highly
pleased
with
agnes
evans
account
of
the
day
was
evident
from
his
manner
to
his
pupils
and
he
did
not
even
reprimand
the
little
girls
who
continued
under
agnes
evans
teaching
while
miss
ashurst
remained
away
to
edna
surprise
louis
was
not
shut
up
but
there
was
a
sullen
look
on
his
face
which
told
of
his
feelings
edna
gratitude
for
his
defense
of
her
increased
her
affection
for
her
cousin
and
she
tried
in
every
way
to
show
him
little
attentions
which
he
took
graciously
enough
but
which
did
not
seem
to
add
very
much
to
his
happiness
and
at
times
edna
felt
very
indignant
at
the
sternness
with
which
he
was
treated
and
the
cold
tones
in
which
he
was
addressed
it
was
very
nice
to
have
uncle
justus
give
her
credit
for
trying
to
be
a
good
girl
and
to
have
aunt
elizabeth
smile
upon
her
but
it
made
her
feel
the
coldness
of
their
manner
to
louis
all
the
more
to
be
sure
aunt
elizabeth
did
not
seem
to
think
edna
ever
could
be
cured
of
certain
faults
you
are
a
very
careless
child
she
would
say
i
am
afraid
you
will
never
be
the
neat
housekeeper
your
grandmother
was
or
edna
that
exhibition
of
temper
over
little
things
must
be
controlled
it
is
a
very
serious
fault
again
it
would
be
you
are
very
babyish
and
lack
there
is
no
need
of
crying
over
such
a
small
matter
as
a
little
blister
on
your
finger
and
edna
wondered
if
she
were
expected
to
be
like
the
spartan
boy
who
held
the
fox
under
his
coat
while
it
gnawed
at
his
heart
aunt
elizabeth
never
pitied
her
and
even
the
little
caresses
from
uncle
justus
were
few
and
far
between
i
should
like
a
real
lap
said
the
little
girl
wistfully
to
her
doll
i
should
like
to
have
mamma
to
hug
and
hug
as
hard
as
i
wanted
and
i
should
like
to
have
sister
to
be
silly
with
i
like
to
be
silly
sometimes
and
sister
does
too
it
is
a
long
time
ada
since
we
saw
them
all
the
boys
and
the
kittens
and
snowflake
and
all
the
rest
i
am
afraid
it
is
going
to
be
a
long
time
more
for
mamma
wrote
that
it
would
have
to
be
quite
warm
weather
before
they
could
come
back
to
be
sure
ellen
had
a
lap
ready
whenever
there
was
time
for
her
to
sit
down
but
she
was
kept
very
busy
the
one
servant
in
a
large
house
and
even
on
the
days
when
the
came
she
worked
just
as
hard
then
aunt
elizabeth
did
not
approve
of
much
time
spent
in
the
kitchen
by
her
niece
and
so
with
louis
grumpy
ellen
busy
uncle
justus
reading
and
aunt
elizabeth
absorbed
in
her
many
interests
there
were
days
which
seemed
very
long
to
the
little
girl
and
once
or
twice
she
went
to
her
room
at
night
so
homesick
that
she
threw
herself
crying
on
the
bed
with
her
doll
hugged
up
to
her
and
fell
fast
asleep
without
undressing
to
awaken
in
the
middle
of
the
night
chilly
and
uncomfortable
finding
herself
on
the
outside
of
the
covers
she
would
then
shiver
out
of
her
clothes
and
creep
into
bed
after
groping
around
to
get
ada
and
place
her
safely
under
the
bedclothes
but
this
was
only
sometimes
generally
speaking
the
days
were
not
unhappy
ones
for
lessons
and
practicing
so
many
squares
of
patchwork
so
many
pages
of
reading
filled
up
the
hours
and
the
playtime
was
not
so
long
as
to
become
tiresome
once
a
week
there
was
a
visit
to
maggie
who
was
always
overjoyed
to
see
her
little
friend
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
when
you
go
home
maggie
said
sadly
one
day
and
when
you
take
moggins
so
far
off
i
never
hear
of
him
edna
was
thoughtful
what
becomes
of
little
girls
who
live
here
till
they
grow
up
she
asked
some
of
do
stay
that
long
they
get
replied
maggie
an
some
of
get
places
and
edna
bore
this
information
in
mind
what
do
you
have
to
do
to
get
she
asked
her
aunt
you
do
do
anything
but
try
to
behave
yourself
replied
she
what
are
you
thinking
about
edna
surely
you
do
not
need
to
have
anyone
to
adopt
you
no
was
the
reply
i
was
thinking
of
maggie
well
if
some
lonely
childless
person
were
to
come
along
and
take
a
fancy
to
maggie
she
might
be
adopted
but
usually
the
younger
children
are
preferred
little
girls
of
her
age
are
not
often
chosen
edna
was
disappointed
she
had
thought
that
maybe
her
aunt
influence
might
be
all
that
was
necessary
provided
maggie
should
care
to
be
chosen
as
some
one
possible
daughter
but
she
did
not
give
up
the
hope
maybe
some
one
will
you
maggie
she
said
and
then
of
course
you
can
have
moggins
back
again
your
new
mamma
would
want
you
to
have
him
and
so
the
two
children
talked
over
this
possibility
as
if
it
were
a
delightful
fairy
tale
all
this
time
louis
discontent
seemed
to
increase
and
he
chafed
more
and
more
under
restraint
it
is
quite
true
that
the
same
kind
of
treatment
did
not
suit
the
two
children
edna
on
the
one
hand
an
honest
conscientious
little
girl
and
on
the
other
hand
louis
a
spoiled
proud
rather
selfish
little
boy
gentle
firmness
would
have
been
best
for
louis
but
firmness
without
gentleness
did
not
suit
him
at
all
and
he
resented
the
methods
of
his
uncle
and
aunt
i
not
going
to
stand
being
ordered
about
as
i
am
and
treated
as
if
i
were
the
worst
person
in
the
world
he
said
to
edna
they
all
right
when
you
are
concerned
but
they
act
as
if
i
were
a
criminal
and
i
do
want
to
be
good
for
them
edna
looked
distressed
o
louis
she
said
i
do
believe
they
feel
that
way
they
act
that
way
replied
he
and
i
know
what
i
am
going
to
do
what
asked
edna
tell
me
louis
i
wo
tell
sure
you
wo
yes
i
sure
give
your
word
of
honor
that
you
wo
tell
anyone
i
know
yes
i
promise
well
and
louis
lifted
his
hand
emphatically
i
going
to
run
away
o
louis
yes
i
going
to
find
my
mother
and
father
why
do
you
write
to
them
to
come
take
you
away
i
have
asked
them
but
they
wrote
back
that
this
was
the
best
place
for
me
and
that
i
must
stay
and
i
wo
i
wo
please
stay
pleaded
edna
just
stand
it
a
little
while
longer
so
afraid
you
get
into
a
herd
of
cattle
out
on
the
prairies
where
they
have
whole
stampedes
and
you
might
get
caught
by
the
indians
and
i
never
see
you
again
and
edna
eyes
filled
at
the
possibility
ho
no
fear
of
that
i
skulk
as
well
as
the
best
of
them
and
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
cattle
i
might
stop
over
night
with
some
of
the
cowboys
but
i
would
stay
replied
louis
with
a
very
dim
idea
of
what
he
might
have
to
encounter
well
anyhow
it
would
be
right
replied
edna
i
like
to
know
why
it
is
as
if
i
were
running
away
my
father
and
mother
i
going
to
run
them
that
makes
all
the
difference
but
louis
had
talked
so
before
and
edna
did
not
take
it
very
much
to
heart
especially
as
just
about
that
time
came
an
invitation
from
agnes
evans
which
uncle
justus
accepted
for
edna
without
consulting
anyone
miss
evans
asked
if
edna
might
be
allowed
to
spend
saturday
and
sunday
in
the
country
the
girl
had
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
the
child
and
had
won
her
confidence
so
that
nowadays
miss
agnes
was
consulted
upon
all
points
and
although
aunt
elizabeth
frowned
upon
the
decision
uncle
justus
would
not
allow
it
to
be
changed
and
so
edna
set
out
very
gayly
and
thought
nothing
could
be
more
delightful
than
to
spend
this
time
with
her
beloved
friend
you
know
said
agnes
i
have
a
little
sister
so
i
am
sure
we
can
make
you
have
a
good
time
do
you
like
the
country
o
i
like
it
much
better
than
the
city
was
the
reply
i
live
in
a
country
place
we
have
chickens
and
a
cow
o
it
has
been
so
long
since
i
saw
a
real
chicken
miss
agnes
laughed
where
did
you
see
any
ones
edna
laughed
too
o
i
mean
live
chickens
i
am
a
little
afraid
of
cows
ours
has
any
horns
it
is
the
horny
kind
i
am
afraid
of
they
were
then
on
their
way
to
the
pretty
country
home
in
which
miss
evans
lived
she
spent
her
time
during
the
week
at
a
married
sister
in
order
to
attend
professor
horner
school
but
she
always
went
home
on
friday
afternoons
returning
monday
it
was
a
mild
day
in
march
when
the
spring
seemed
quite
near
although
snow
and
frost
might
still
be
expected
at
the
station
a
carriage
met
them
and
they
were
driven
about
half
a
mile
to
where
a
low
house
stood
two
great
cedar
trees
stood
one
on
each
side
the
walk
which
led
up
to
the
house
and
which
was
bordered
by
a
box
hedge
so
high
that
edna
could
not
see
over
it
a
little
girl
a
trifle
younger
than
edna
came
dancing
down
to
meet
them
she
had
yellow
curly
hair
and
big
blue
eyes
edna
thought
her
very
pretty
and
was
ready
at
once
to
make
friends
with
her
illustration
dorothy
take
edna
up
to
your
room
dorothy
said
miss
agnes
you
are
to
be
roommates
you
know
show
her
your
dolls
and
make
her
at
home
and
edna
followed
her
new
acquaintance
up
the
broad
staircase
feeling
that
this
was
much
more
like
being
at
home
she
is
a
dear
little
child
agnes
said
to
her
mother
and
i
am
sure
is
often
homesick
and
longs
for
her
own
little
playmates
you
must
bring
her
out
often
replied
motherly
evans
i
can
imagine
how
glad
i
should
be
to
have
some
one
take
a
little
notice
of
dorothy
if
she
were
away
from
home
how
long
are
you
going
to
stay
asked
dorothy
not
meaning
to
be
rude
but
like
most
children
wanting
to
crowd
all
she
could
into
the
time
till
monday
evening
answered
edna
but
it
was
not
on
the
next
monday
nor
the
one
following
that
which
found
edna
back
again
in
the
city
chapter
x
more
surprises
said
dorothy
we
will
have
a
good
time
we
can
play
the
whole
day
long
that
will
be
so
nice
returned
edna
with
a
little
sigh
of
content
i
just
love
to
play
with
dolls
do
you
i
believe
if
i
had
a
hundred
dolls
i
should
love
every
one
i
do
know
about
a
hundred
dolls
replied
dorothy
but
i
know
i
could
love
i
am
going
to
hunt
up
all
i
have
broken
ones
and
all
we
get
agnes
to
help
us
mend
them
then
we
can
divide
them
and
you
can
have
half
while
you
are
here
said
the
little
girl
generously
so
a
delightful
morning
it
was
choosing
dolls
dressing
them
playing
party
and
all
done
in
such
a
merry
humor
that
evans
and
agnes
sitting
in
the
room
opposite
the
nursery
often
smiled
to
hear
peals
of
laughter
those
children
are
having
a
good
time
remarked
evans
there
has
been
nothing
but
peace
between
them
i
thought
they
would
suit
one
another
returned
agnes
i
think
i
shall
send
them
over
to
macdonald
this
afternoon
evans
went
on
edna
will
like
the
walk
and
i
promised
to
let
macdonald
know
about
some
flower
bulbs
therefore
after
an
early
dinner
the
two
little
girls
set
out
to
take
a
walk
over
the
country
road
to
this
neighbor
macdonald
was
a
widow
who
lived
all
alone
in
a
big
house
substantially
built
of
gray
stone
she
had
once
been
a
dressmaker
had
married
when
no
longer
young
a
man
of
wealth
who
died
a
few
years
after
their
marriage
leaving
her
very
well
off
she
had
no
children
was
a
little
peculiar
but
a
thoroughly
good
woman
and
a
neighbor
whom
evans
much
esteemed
she
was
very
fond
of
dorothy
and
met
the
little
girls
very
cordially
bless
my
little
goldilocks
she
said
in
greeting
and
who
is
this
this
is
edna
conway
dorothy
informed
her
she
is
making
me
a
visit
o
macdonald
may
i
show
her
the
greenhouse
to
be
sure
you
may
but
you
must
be
hungry
after
your
long
walk
go
ask
lizzie
to
get
you
some
doughnuts
you
know
where
to
find
her
edna
did
not
know
whether
or
not
to
follow
her
friend
but
thought
it
would
be
more
polite
to
sit
with
her
hostess
macdonald
had
nothing
to
say
for
a
while
and
edna
was
puzzling
her
brain
as
to
what
suitable
remark
she
could
make
when
macdonald
surprised
her
by
saying
how
should
you
like
to
come
here
and
be
my
little
girl
this
was
a
difficult
question
to
answer
but
edna
got
through
bravely
by
saying
if
i
did
have
any
mamma
and
papa
of
my
own
i
should
like
it
very
much
it
is
very
pretty
here
and
i
like
to
be
near
dorothy
and
she
added
timidly
you
look
like
a
very
good
lady
she
would
like
to
have
said
you
are
a
very
pretty
lady
but
macdonald
was
not
handsome
a
hearty
laugh
was
the
little
girl
reply
well
dear
was
then
made
answer
i
not
rob
your
father
and
mother
of
such
a
bonny
little
lass
if
it
is
too
big
a
place
for
one
lonely
old
woman
to
have
to
herself
are
you
lonely
asked
edna
with
much
sympathy
in
her
tones
she
jumped
down
from
her
chair
and
came
closer
a
bright
idea
had
occurred
to
her
i
know
a
little
girl
that
wants
very
much
to
be
she
said
earnestly
you
do
tell
me
about
her
so
edna
began
a
story
which
dorothy
reappearance
did
not
interrupt
so
interested
were
both
herself
and
her
listener
you
see
said
edna
in
conclusion
folding
her
little
warm
hands
very
closely
as
was
her
fashion
when
much
interested
you
see
maggie
does
have
a
chance
to
be
like
the
littler
girls
people
like
the
baby
ones
best
though
if
i
were
a
lady
like
you
i
maggie
she
concluded
at
this
moment
lizzie
made
her
appearance
with
the
plate
of
doughnuts
she
was
a
woman
with
rather
a
sad
face
though
a
kindly
one
what
is
maggie
last
name
asked
macdonald
her
name
is
maggie
horn
lizzie
putting
down
the
plate
turned
with
a
look
of
surprise
to
edna
what
maggie
horn
she
asked
what
about
her
why
do
you
know
my
maggie
asked
edna
i
know
a
maggie
horn
and
she
turned
to
macdonald
excuse
me
but
my
breath
was
quite
taken
away
by
hearing
the
young
lady
speak
of
a
maggie
horn
that
is
all
right
lizzie
perhaps
you
can
tell
us
something
of
the
little
girl
who
has
been
treated
unkindly
said
macdonald
i
am
interested
in
edna
story
of
her
well
the
little
child
that
i
used
to
know
was
left
quite
alone
by
a
poor
lady
who
died
in
the
house
where
i
lodged
she
had
been
quite
well
in
her
day
a
milliner
and
a
good
one
i
take
it
but
she
married
a
bad
man
who
went
through
with
her
bit
of
a
fortune
and
then
went
on
leaving
her
with
this
one
child
the
trouble
and
all
wore
on
her
and
with
weak
lungs
she
grew
worse
and
worse
poorer
and
poorer
though
always
proud
and
most
a
respectable
lady
with
a
good
education
she
died
when
the
little
one
was
three
years
old
and
left
the
child
with
me
but
as
you
know
i
had
my
own
troubles
and
when
a
family
by
the
name
of
hawkins
moved
into
the
street
as
wanted
a
bit
of
a
girl
to
give
an
eye
to
the
baby
i
thought
it
was
a
chance
for
maggie
to
begin
to
make
her
living
indeed
i
did
mean
to
turn
her
off
to
be
but
i
thought
it
was
none
too
soon
for
her
to
begin
to
look
out
for
herself
she
was
eight
years
old
why
you
must
be
ryan
exclaimed
edna
putting
this
and
that
together
and
you
were
good
to
maggie
she
was
maggie
told
me
so
she
continued
turning
to
macdonald
it
was
a
sorry
day
i
parted
from
her
said
lizzie
but
i
had
my
own
flesh
and
blood
to
look
after
and
my
husband
funeral
and
doctor
bills
to
stand
and
so
i
did
my
best
you
meant
to
do
right
i
have
no
doubt
said
macdonald
it
was
an
error
of
judgment
now
when
the
children
have
finished
their
doughnuts
i
want
you
to
tell
john
to
show
them
the
greenhouses
lizzie
led
the
way
asking
many
questions
about
maggie
and
expressing
her
thankfulness
that
she
was
freed
from
an
unhappy
life
the
greenhouses
were
a
delight
to
edna
she
was
specially
pleased
to
see
ripe
strawberries
this
early
in
the
year
and
gave
the
gardener
a
beaming
smile
when
he
told
her
to
pick
one
for
herself
i
am
going
to
carry
it
home
to
miss
agnes
she
declared
and
i
take
mine
to
mamma
determined
dorothy
who
had
been
allowed
the
same
privilege
macdonald
had
ordered
the
gardener
to
give
them
each
a
little
bunch
of
violets
so
they
said
their
much
pleased
with
the
visit
was
it
queer
that
i
should
have
seen
mrs
ryan
said
edna
i
shall
have
so
much
to
tell
maggie
i
think
it
is
funny
for
you
to
be
friends
with
a
little
orphan
asylum
girl
returned
dorothy
well
you
see
she
is
zactly
a
orphan
they
do
know
whether
she
has
a
father
or
not
and
then
you
know
i
feel
so
sorry
for
her
so
do
i
replied
dorothy
i
do
mean
i
would
help
her
if
i
could
but
i
never
knew
anyone
before
who
had
a
friend
like
that
o
said
edna
suddenly
my
strawberry
is
getting
so
soft
i
shall
have
to
eat
it
i
wish
i
had
held
it
by
the
stem
instead
of
in
my
hand
yours
is
a
bit
soft
perhaps
yours
was
the
ripest
i
eat
mine
too
if
you
eat
yours
and
we
can
give
mamma
and
sister
the
violets
this
was
agreed
upon
and
the
children
disposed
of
the
strawberries
lingeringly
miss
agnes
was
lying
on
the
lounge
when
they
found
her
in
the
i
have
a
bad
headache
she
told
edna
did
you
enjoy
your
walk
illustration
miss
agnes
yes
replied
she
but
i
awfully
tired
come
cuddle
up
here
by
me
said
miss
agnes
you
have
had
such
an
exciting
time
i
do
wonder
you
are
tired
you
must
go
to
bed
early
edna
was
quite
ready
to
share
with
dorothy
the
pretty
little
brass
bedstead
but
she
did
not
lie
awake
long
and
in
the
morning
was
very
loath
to
move
when
dorothy
called
her
how
red
your
face
is
said
dorothy
as
edna
sat
up
you
look
sort
of
queer
i
feel
sort
of
queer
replied
she
putting
her
head
down
on
the
pillow
again
dorothy
slipped
out
of
bed
and
ran
into
the
next
room
where
her
sister
slept
at
her
gentle
little
shake
agnes
turned
over
with
a
sigh
what
is
it
she
asked
sleepily
why
began
dorothy
o
sister
your
face
is
red
too
is
it
i
feel
headachy
you
and
edna
look
just
the
same
way
declared
dorothy
and
sure
enough
both
showed
cases
of
measles
edna
was
not
very
ill
but
it
was
not
considered
safe
for
her
to
go
back
to
the
city
for
some
time
much
to
dorothy
delight
hearing
of
the
two
sick
girls
macdonald
came
over
and
took
edna
under
her
especial
care
she
was
an
excellent
nurse
and
made
the
little
child
as
comfortable
as
a
tender
mother
could
then
when
edna
was
able
to
be
up
and
macdonald
was
no
longer
needed
every
day
came
fruit
or
flowers
from
the
kind
woman
one
day
edna
was
much
surprised
by
a
visit
from
uncle
justus
two
whole
weeks
since
she
had
seen
him
and
he
brought
her
who
would
have
thought
it
he
brought
edna
doll
ada
with
him
why
uncle
justus
said
edna
looking
at
her
doll
with
pleased
eyes
how
did
you
happen
to
know
that
i
wanted
to
see
ada
so
much
i
did
not
know
i
only
thought
that
a
little
girl
who
was
so
fond
of
her
doll
would
be
very
likely
to
be
glad
to
see
it
when
are
we
going
to
have
you
back
again
next
week
replied
evans
we
can
not
let
her
go
till
then
i
am
afraid
that
dorothy
will
be
very
disconsolate
at
the
loss
of
her
little
friend
they
have
had
such
good
times
together
i
am
afraid
edna
will
be
very
far
behind
her
classes
said
uncle
justus
and
will
have
to
study
hard
to
make
up
for
lost
time
having
seen
uncle
justus
and
heard
all
the
news
edna
felt
that
she
should
like
to
stay
on
indefinitely
it
was
very
nice
to
be
just
sick
enough
to
be
considered
and
to
have
good
things
to
eat
to
have
such
cosy
little
meals
with
miss
agnes
before
either
of
them
were
well
enough
to
go
down
stairs
to
receive
from
macdonald
every
day
some
dainty
and
to
have
evans
appear
every
evening
with
a
delightful
story
book
from
which
she
would
read
aloud
then
it
was
pleasant
to
be
thrown
with
such
a
bright
companion
as
dorothy
who
was
always
ready
to
devise
some
new
play
or
to
shake
out
a
bag
of
pretty
pieces
for
doll
clothes
altogether
edna
thought
herself
very
fortunate
to
have
fallen
into
such
good
hands
it
is
almost
like
being
at
home
she
said
i
wish
you
knew
my
mamma
mrs
evans
it
will
not
be
very
long
before
you
see
her
will
it
asked
evans
stooping
to
tuck
in
a
shawl
around
the
child
not
till
may
replied
edna
i
mamma
will
stay
till
then
well
perhaps
you
will
come
back
next
year
and
then
we
shall
see
more
of
you
edna
looked
thoughtful
she
knew
there
had
been
some
talk
of
her
returning
another
year
she
loved
all
these
friends
but
she
was
still
quite
sure
that
home
was
best
evans
speech
made
her
a
little
homesick
she
wanted
her
mamma
to
be
sick
without
any
mother
at
hand
seemed
a
very
unnatural
thing
she
was
a
little
tired
perhaps
she
would
try
to
go
to
sleep
she
dozed
off
just
as
dorothy
came
tiptoeing
into
the
room
there
was
a
look
of
pleased
excitement
upon
her
face
and
she
fidgeted
about
till
edna
awoke
from
her
little
nap
did
i
wake
you
she
asked
contritely
o
edna
i
know
such
a
splendid
something
what
asked
edna
raising
herself
on
her
elbow
i
ca
tell
you
just
now
you
know
pretty
soon
o
you
be
so
glad
i
think
you
might
tell
me
returned
edna
a
little
peevishly
do
be
cross
said
dorothy
winningly
i
had
to
promise
not
to
tell
but
i
did
want
you
to
expect
something
awfully
nice
when
shall
i
know
o
i
know
what
it
is
i
going
to
take
a
drive
your
mamma
told
me
that
not
all
replied
dorothy
gleefully
i
can
hardly
keep
from
telling
so
please
do
ask
me
here
comes
your
supper
macdonald
has
sent
you
some
lovely
jelly
several
times
before
bedtime
dorothy
almost
let
out
the
secret
but
edna
never
suspected
so
when
the
next
day
the
carriage
stood
waiting
to
take
her
to
drive
she
did
not
in
the
least
know
where
they
were
going
nor
why
chapter
xi
adopted
as
the
carriage
turned
into
the
driveway
which
led
up
to
macdonald
house
edna
exclaimed
o
i
know
the
we
are
going
to
see
mrs
macdonald
dorothy
clapped
her
two
hands
over
her
mouth
as
if
to
keep
in
the
secret
that
trembled
upon
her
lips
then
she
looked
up
at
her
mother
repressing
a
little
chuckle
yes
we
are
going
to
macdonald
said
evans
smiling
they
were
ushered
into
the
cosy
library
where
an
open
wood
fire
was
blazing
some
one
was
curled
up
in
a
big
chair
before
the
fire
a
little
girl
with
curly
auburn
locks
falling
about
her
face
she
wore
a
soft
cashmere
frock
and
was
a
very
little
maid
she
glanced
up
quickly
as
the
visitors
entered
the
room
then
a
bright
smile
broke
over
her
face
and
she
ran
forward
to
meet
them
why
exclaimed
edna
it
maggie
maggie
horn
no
and
the
auburn
locks
shook
a
decided
negative
no
it
maggie
horn
it
margaret
macdonald
o
edna
i
edna
danced
up
and
down
in
sheer
delight
and
dorothy
followed
suit
then
edna
gave
maggie
a
great
hugging
tell
me
all
about
it
she
said
how
did
it
happen
o
dorothy
this
is
the
most
delicious
secret
that
ever
was
how
did
you
keep
it
evans
left
the
children
in
order
to
find
macdonald
who
was
in
the
conservatory
and
maggie
began
well
she
said
smoothing
down
her
frock
and
taking
a
long
breath
i
was
in
the
schoolroom
you
know
when
miss
barnes
was
called
out
to
see
a
lady
and
after
a
while
she
came
back
and
said
some
one
wanted
to
see
me
i
thought
it
was
my
beautiful
ramsey
so
i
was
very
glad
but
it
was
ramsey
at
all
it
was
a
lady
i
had
never
seen
before
she
looked
at
me
very
hard
and
asked
me
a
lot
of
questions
all
about
my
mother
and
lots
of
things
and
miss
barnes
told
me
to
bring
my
bible
that
belonged
to
my
mother
and
show
it
to
the
lady
and
when
she
saw
my
mother
name
wallace
from
her
loving
mother
margaret
wallace
glasgow
scotland
she
said
she
has
my
name
margaret
and
she
has
scotch
blood
in
her
the
same
as
i
and
my
husband
she
shall
be
my
own
little
lassie
that
was
what
my
mother
called
me
ryan
used
to
say
and
it
sounded
so
natural
so
she
told
me
her
name
was
macdonald
and
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
be
her
own
little
girl
and
o
edna
i
was
so
glad
and
that
was
three
days
ago
and
o
it
was
like
a
dream
for
when
i
got
here
who
should
run
and
meet
me
but
dear
old
ryan
she
told
me
my
father
died
just
after
my
mother
did
and
that
nobody
had
a
claim
on
me
so
i
could
be
margaret
macdonald
forever
and
ever
well
chatterboxes
here
a
voice
interrupted
have
you
had
your
talk
out
we
must
be
going
and
evans
with
macdonald
entered
the
room
edna
ran
toward
the
latter
o
macdonald
she
cried
i
do
want
to
kiss
you
you
wo
be
lonely
any
more
will
you
no
i
think
not
replied
macdonald
and
i
do
want
my
little
daughter
to
be
so
evans
has
promised
that
you
and
dorothy
shall
spend
day
after
with
us
this
was
a
delightful
prospect
and
edna
declared
that
the
drive
and
the
pleasure
of
seeing
maggie
had
made
her
feel
entirely
well
i
ca
get
over
it
she
said
to
think
of
maggie
living
in
that
dear
old
house
and
having
that
great
big
garden
to
play
in
and
being
just
like
any
nice
little
girl
o
it
is
just
too
lovely
for
anything
that
was
a
happy
day
which
the
three
little
girls
spent
together
margaret
as
the
two
others
delighted
to
call
her
brought
out
the
doll
which
had
been
awarded
her
at
the
fair
to
be
displayed
to
dorothy
interested
eyes
i
must
tell
miss
martin
she
will
be
so
glad
said
edna
and
o
margaret
you
must
have
moggins
i
shall
have
to
send
him
out
to
you
but
there
was
a
tinge
of
regret
in
her
tone
will
macdonald
let
you
keep
him
asked
dorothy
turning
to
margaret
illustration
i
go
and
ask
her
decided
edna
and
straightway
took
herself
to
macdonald
and
was
not
long
in
winning
her
consent
but
margaret
was
not
willing
to
rob
her
friend
at
once
of
such
an
amusing
companion
as
moggins
wait
till
you
go
home
she
said
and
then
you
will
not
miss
him
and
edna
although
she
protested
was
secretly
glad
when
this
was
decided
upon
a
pretty
little
room
had
been
prepared
for
margaret
to
use
as
her
very
own
macdonald
believed
in
substantials
and
did
not
indulge
in
much
ornament
she
was
extremely
fond
of
flowers
and
her
greenhouse
was
her
greatest
luxury
the
house
in
which
she
lived
was
large
and
exceedingly
comfortable
but
was
not
as
tasteful
in
its
appointments
as
that
of
evans
i
am
a
plain
woman
said
macdonald
to
evans
and
i
not
given
to
i
like
my
flowers
and
my
book
and
now
my
little
daughter
suits
me
much
better
than
if
she
were
a
beauty
she
has
a
nice
sensible
interesting
face
returned
evans
and
please
god
she
shall
be
a
nice
sensible
interesting
woman
replied
macdonald
and
i
hope
a
contented
one
it
just
wonderful
what
one
little
child
can
do
i
thinking
evans
of
that
little
child
edna
she
has
brought
gladness
to
more
hearts
than
one
by
the
loving
little
spirit
in
her
she
a
dear
little
body
replied
evans
she
always
makes
the
best
of
things
her
little
cheery
ways
are
good
to
see
and
are
a
lesson
to
us
older
growlers
i
think
my
margaret
is
going
to
be
much
the
same
said
macdonald
it
no
wonder
they
took
to
each
other
when
poor
little
margaret
has
forgotten
how
ill
a
world
she
lived
in
i
think
brighten
many
a
life
by
her
own
content
meanwhile
the
children
thus
discussed
were
making
the
most
of
their
opportunities
for
the
day
was
at
hand
when
edna
must
return
to
the
city
it
must
be
confessed
that
all
these
good
times
had
rather
spoiled
the
little
girl
for
the
taking
up
of
her
life
at
school
but
she
was
very
brave
about
it
and
indeed
rather
reproached
herself
for
having
any
regrets
at
all
in
leaving
these
pleasant
friends
then
she
began
to
wonder
about
louis
feeling
quite
selfish
at
having
been
too
much
taken
up
in
the
affairs
which
had
lately
interested
her
to
think
of
how
he
might
be
faring
and
she
set
out
with
a
serious
mind
for
her
journey
home
we
will
stop
at
the
and
see
if
there
are
any
letters
said
evans
who
had
taken
the
little
girl
under
his
protection
the
train
will
not
be
due
for
some
minutes
and
edna
stood
on
the
platform
until
he
should
return
i
did
find
a
letter
for
you
he
said
as
he
joined
her
and
she
was
handed
an
envelope
addressed
in
louis
schoolboy
hand
the
train
was
now
in
sight
and
after
establishing
the
little
girl
in
a
seat
by
the
window
evans
left
her
for
a
few
minutes
and
edna
opened
her
letter
it
was
dated
a
day
or
two
earlier
dear
edna
it
read
i
am
going
to
run
away
do
tell
anyone
i
know
you
wo
go
back
on
me
i
am
going
to
my
father
and
mother
in
pasadena
affectionately
louis
a
distressed
little
child
it
was
who
turned
the
letter
over
and
over
helplessly
she
had
been
having
such
a
good
time
all
unhappy
things
had
been
smoothed
away
from
her
and
it
seemed
as
if
this
going
back
became
suddenly
more
dreadful
than
she
could
possibly
have
expected
she
was
very
quiet
during
the
short
trip
once
in
a
while
casting
furtive
glances
at
evans
who
absorbed
in
his
newspaper
did
no
more
than
address
a
word
or
two
to
her
he
set
her
down
at
her
door
bidding
her
pleasantly
and
telling
her
that
they
should
hope
to
see
her
in
the
country
often
the
latch
of
the
door
being
up
edna
went
in
feeling
very
it
was
early
on
saturday
afternoon
the
house
was
very
quiet
there
was
no
one
in
the
and
edna
went
through
the
and
on
to
where
she
heard
voices
ellen
in
a
freshly
scoured
kitchen
was
chatting
with
a
friend
while
she
set
things
to
rights
she
turned
with
an
exclamation
at
the
sight
of
edna
bless
the
choild
she
cried
comin
in
like
a
bit
of
a
ghost
good
to
see
ye
darlint
an
are
ye
well
again
let
me
see
thim
cheeks
bid
to
be
a
bit
more
rosy
where
is
uncle
asked
edna
sure
the
two
of
thim
is
after
masther
louis
and
louis
edna
lip
quivered
she
hoped
against
hope
hear
now
he
gone
av
coorse
when
did
he
go
asked
edna
her
voice
shaking
poor
dear
do
mourn
to
be
sure
ye
be
missin
him
he
went
let
ellen
take
off
your
wrap
and
thin
ye
can
go
up
and
see
how
nate
an
nice
yer
room
looks
and
ellen
turned
to
continue
an
exciting
bit
of
gossip
for
her
friend
benefit
edna
slowly
went
up
stairs
she
felt
o
so
lonely
and
such
a
weight
as
louis
secret
gave
her
ellen
could
understand
and
did
seem
to
care
what
should
she
do
if
louis
father
and
mother
only
knew
perhaps
they
could
do
something
grown
people
had
so
many
ways
of
preventing
mishaps
time
and
space
were
often
no
obstacles
to
them
suppose
uncle
justus
and
aunt
elizabeth
should
find
him
and
bring
him
back
edna
sympathies
were
divided
she
knew
her
cousin
would
be
punished
and
yet
she
knew
the
others
would
be
troubled
sorely
if
he
did
not
return
she
sat
on
the
top
step
of
the
stairs
thinking
thinking
harder
than
ever
before
in
her
life
louis
had
run
away
because
he
was
unhappy
he
had
not
let
his
parents
know
for
fear
they
would
tell
his
aunt
and
uncle
to
take
measures
to
prevent
it
but
if
they
knew
he
had
actually
started
they
would
realize
maybe
how
miserable
he
had
been
and
would
take
his
part
if
she
could
only
let
them
know
why
she
could
of
course
she
could
she
could
send
a
telegram
she
knew
she
could
there
was
a
telegraph
office
down
at
the
depot
from
which
she
had
just
come
perhaps
she
could
get
there
and
back
before
her
aunt
and
uncle
returned
and
no
one
would
miss
her
fired
by
this
idea
she
started
out
intent
upon
the
business
in
hand
she
had
little
difficulty
in
finding
the
place
and
went
timidly
up
to
the
desk
she
stood
still
not
knowing
just
what
to
do
until
the
clerk
looking
up
said
well
little
girl
what
is
it
i
want
to
send
a
telegram
she
answered
where
asked
the
man
pulling
a
blank
toward
him
edna
carefully
unfolded
the
letter
from
louis
pasadena
california
she
said
name
continued
the
man
william
morrison
well
what
is
the
message
edna
looked
doubtfully
at
him
have
you
forgotten
it
he
asked
no
but
i
but
i
well
then
out
with
it
the
man
was
a
trifle
impatient
i
think
i
had
just
better
say
louis
has
runned
away
the
man
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
a
smile
came
over
his
face
o
you
are
sending
it
yourself
are
you
he
said
edna
nodded
do
you
want
to
pay
for
it
or
shall
it
paid
at
the
other
end
here
was
another
dilemma
but
edna
concluded
that
since
the
contents
of
her
little
purse
might
not
cover
the
expense
it
would
best
be
paid
for
at
pasadena
then
having
asked
her
name
the
man
told
her
it
was
all
right
and
she
left
with
a
sense
of
relief
she
was
making
her
way
home
again
as
fast
as
possible
when
suddenly
she
stood
still
with
terror
for
coming
up
the
street
directly
toward
her
was
a
herd
of
texas
cattle
on
their
way
to
the
stock
yards
if
there
was
anything
that
edna
feared
it
was
these
creatures
their
horns
seemed
to
menace
her
even
a
block
away
and
as
the
foremost
one
was
quite
near
she
turned
in
a
perfect
agony
of
fear
and
went
tumbling
pell
mell
up
the
first
high
flight
of
steps
which
she
happened
to
see
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
would
never
be
able
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
those
dreadful
horns
and
the
rushing
sound
of
hoofs
and
the
bellowings
which
were
issuing
from
the
creatures
appeared
to
surround
her
completely
how
she
reached
the
top
step
she
hardly
knew
but
scrambling
falling
in
her
haste
she
gained
her
place
of
safety
sprawling
flat
on
her
face
as
she
did
so
chapter
xii
the
runaway
meanwhile
uncle
justus
had
returned
and
was
told
by
ellen
that
edna
had
arrived
a
pleased
look
came
into
professor
horner
face
send
her
to
me
ellen
he
said
and
ellen
hastened
up
stairs
to
do
his
bidding
failing
to
find
the
child
in
her
room
she
hunted
high
and
low
but
no
edna
and
she
returned
to
professor
horner
in
perplexity
shure
sor
i
looked
the
house
over
an
the
choild
is
nowhere
at
all
at
all
she
informed
him
uncle
justus
looked
annoyed
some
one
should
have
been
here
when
she
came
he
said
to
himself
perhaps
she
went
to
the
candy
shop
to
spend
some
pennies
no
doubt
that
is
it
she
will
be
here
in
a
few
moments
and
he
settled
himself
comfortably
but
the
time
passed
and
edna
did
not
appear
professor
horner
walked
the
floor
thoughtfully
then
putting
on
his
hat
and
coat
he
went
out
first
to
the
candy
shop
where
nothing
was
learned
of
edna
then
to
the
different
houses
in
the
neighborhood
in
which
the
little
schoolmates
might
be
found
but
no
one
had
seen
the
child
and
uncle
justus
returned
home
to
find
that
his
wife
had
arrived
she
too
looked
anxious
as
her
husband
appeared
with
no
little
niece
edna
is
an
obedient
child
she
said
and
she
is
not
prone
to
get
into
serious
mischief
but
that
is
why
i
am
the
more
anxious
replied
uncle
justus
i
was
about
to
say
that
this
influence
under
which
she
has
been
may
have
spoiled
her
continued
aunt
elizabeth
remembering
that
it
was
at
her
husband
suggestion
that
the
visit
to
the
country
was
made
uncle
justus
frowned
that
is
not
likely
and
if
it
were
what
has
it
to
do
with
the
case
she
may
have
taken
a
fancy
to
go
back
there
uncle
justus
caught
at
the
suggestion
he
rose
to
his
feet
where
are
you
going
asked
horner
i
am
going
to
see
if
she
has
gone
back
and
he
was
soon
on
his
way
to
evans
office
that
gentleman
insisted
on
making
the
journey
with
the
perturbed
professor
and
the
two
set
out
together
but
on
arriving
they
found
only
the
family
and
the
situation
grew
more
and
more
perplexing
i
am
sure
edna
is
too
conscientious
to
start
back
here
without
leave
said
evans
she
talked
very
cheerfully
of
her
return
i
am
so
afraid
she
is
run
over
by
a
trolley
car
said
agnes
in
distress
or
maybe
she
is
lost
and
will
be
out
in
the
dark
night
all
alone
wept
dorothy
o
papa
do
try
and
find
her
and
the
two
men
returned
to
the
city
together
no
news
at
police
stations
of
a
lost
or
injured
child
and
to
the
railway
depots
as
a
last
resource
they
betook
themselves
as
uncle
justus
was
making
his
inquiries
some
one
stood
by
listening

of

colored
porters

got
us
to
send
a
message
what
was
it
asked
uncle
justus
eagerly
the
man
smiled
as
near
as
i
can
recollect
it
was
has
runned
away
it
was
sent
to
william
morrison
pasadena
california
uncle
justus
looked
puzzled
i
can
not
understand
why
the
message
was
sent
he
said
and
after
some
further
questions
he
concluded
to
return
home
meanwhile
how
fared
it
with
edna
at
the
instant
that
she
fell
upon
the
stone
step
in
her
flight
from
the
cattle
the
door
opened
and
she
was
lifted
to
her
feet
by
a
boy
who
followed
by
another
came
out
of
the
house
why
little
girl
said
the
boy
who
gave
her
his
help
you
cut
your
lip
it
is
all
bleeding
did
you
fall
down
that
is
too
bad
and
he
began
tenderly
to
wipe
off
the
stains
of
blood
come
in
and
let
mother
wash
it
off
he
continued
you
call
mother
steve
he
said
to
the
other
boy
and
edna
was
drawn
into
the
house
whether
or
no
some
one
came
swiftly
down
the
hall
what
is
the
matter
roger
a
voice
asked
why
i
know
this
little
girl
i
have
wondered
for
a
long
time
if
i
should
see
her
again
it
is
little
edna
conway
and
looking
up
edna
recognized
her
kind
travelling
companion
porter
and
you
never
came
to
see
me
continued
the
lady
reproachfully
i
had
quite
given
you
up
but
late
than
never
and
now
that
i
have
you
i
mean
to
have
a
good
long
visit
to
make
up
for
your
not
coming
before
i
could
come
before
replied
edna
my
aunt
does
allow
me
to
visit
she
looked
up
wistfully
not
liking
to
explain
that
this
appearance
of
herself
was
purely
accidental
but
i
very
very
glad
to
see
you
she
added
porter
was
busy
washing
off
the
stain
it
is
very
much
of
a
cut
she
said
i
do
not
think
it
will
trouble
you
much
i
was
so
afraid
of
the
cows
replied
edna
and
i
ran
up
the
steps
as
hard
as
i
could
scramble
out
of
the
way
they
are
rather
terrifying
i
admit
how
came
your
aunt
to
allow
you
away
down
here
alone
when
she
is
so
particular
asked
porter
edna
was
silent
and
stood
with
downcast
eyes
then
she
looked
up
saying
candidly
my
aunt
did
have
anything
to
say
about
it
i
had
to
come
i
had
to
indeed
i
did
but
i
rather
not
tell
why
porter
looked
down
into
the
clear
eyes
but
they
answered
her
look
too
innocently
for
her
to
suspect
any
wrong
motive
so
she
smiled
and
kissed
her
little
visitor
never
mind
then
she
replied
now
you
are
here
you
must
stay
and
take
tea
with
us
i
want
you
to
know
my
boys
you
look
rather
pale
have
you
been
sick
i
had
the
measles
but
i
must
go
home
porter
they
will
be
worried
about
me
no
they
wo
i
will
send
steve
with
a
note
right
away
i
will
tell
your
aunt
that
you
tumbled
up
my
steps
and
that
i
am
going
to
keep
you
a
while
i
will
make
it
all
right
and
this
was
done
forthwith
there
was
no
resisting
porter
but
yet
edna
had
a
little
uneasy
feeling
at
heart
that
it
was
not
just
right
for
her
to
remain
although
she
felt
tired
and
her
head
ached
stephen
was
dispatched
with
the
note
and
soon
returned
saying
he
had
delivered
it
safely
into
ellen
hands
and
the
two
boys
proceeded
to
amuse
their
little
visitor
with
as
much
gallantry
as
possible
roger
brought
out
his
punch
and
judy
figures
stephen
displayed
his
electric
motor
and
his
therefore
the
afternoon
passed
very
quickly
and
edna
forgot
her
fright
and
her
troubles
in
all
the
new
and
interesting
games
the
boys
had
to
show
i
wish
we
had
a
little
sister
said
roger
and
i
wish
my
two
brothers
were
here
returned
edna
we
be
your
two
brothers
while
you
are
here
said
stephen
edna
laughed
then
i
have
to
call
you
frank
and
charlie
and
she
proceeded
to
decide
which
should
be
which
and
to
tell
the
boys
of
her
brothers
pranks
and
funny
sayings
this
was
after
tea
when
the
three
were
having
a
fine
time
over
a
game
of
parchesi
sitting
around
a
big
table
presently
the
bell
rang
there
were
voices
in
the
hall
questions
and
answers
and
porter
was
summoned
then
in
another
minute
in
walked
uncle
justus
a
look
at
his
face
told
edna
something
of
his
anxiety
but
he
held
out
his
hand
and
she
went
straight
to
him
where
he
kept
her
close
as
if
he
could
not
let
her
go
we
thought
you
were
lost
he
said
in
trembling
tones
i
have
been
looking
for
you
since
early
in
the
day
o
cried
edna
uncle
justus
i
am
so
sorry
did
horner
get
my
note
asked
porter
that
she
did
receive
it
made
the
trouble
replied
uncle
justus
the
maid
took
the
note
and
put
it
on
the
hall
table
where
it
was
not
discovered
until
an
hour
ago
ellen
having
forgotten
it
and
not
connecting
it
with
edna
in
the
meantime
i
have
been
searching
everywhere
it
is
my
fault
cried
porter
i
should
not
have
kept
edna
this
time
but
i
was
so
glad
to
see
her
and
she
had
hurt
herself
besides
she
looked
so
pale
and
tired
where
were
you
going
when
you
started
down
town
asked
uncle
justus
o
edna
said
uncle
justus
i
felt
so
dreadfully
about
louis
i
could
stand
it
well
my
child
i
do
understand
why
you
should
but
we
had
better
go
straight
home
now
and
relieve
the
minds
of
your
friends
edna
did
not
talk
much
on
the
way
home
but
she
held
uncle
hand
very
tightly
was
i
very
bad
once
she
asked
softly
uncle
justus
for
answer
gave
her
hand
a
little
squeeze
and
she
was
satisfied
she
did
not
ask
about
louis
for
she
thought
her
uncle
had
been
troubled
enough
she
felt
that
somewhere
and
somehow
she
had
made
a
mistake
i
do
believe
little
girls
know
just
what
is
right
to
do
without
asking
grown
people
she
said
as
they
left
the
car
and
neared
home
it
awfully
hard
to
do
right
every
time
by
yourself
is
it
uncle
justus
yes
it
is
best
to
ask
advice
he
replied
as
he
opened
the
front
door
with
his
edna
rushed
in
the
seemed
full
of
people
who
were
they
all
why
there
was
louis
not
run
away
at
all
but
safe
and
sound
with
an
arm
fondly
around
his
mother
neck
and
there
no
it
could
not
be
there
were
her
own
father
and
mother
edna
gave
one
scream
of
joy
ignoring
aunt
elizabeth
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
three
weeks
scarcely
seeing
louis
or
anyone
but
throwing
herself
into
the
dear
arms
for
which
she
had
so
often
longed
during
these
last
months
so
my
little
runaway
we
have
you
safe
and
sound
said
her
father
edna
looked
around
bewildered
she
a
little
runaway
did
he
mean
her
why
it
was
louis
who
ran
away
i
did
run
away
she
said
indignantly
it
was
louis
and
then
everybody
laughed
why
she
did
know
now
give
an
account
of
yourself
said
conway
who
told
you
louis
had
gone
away
why
ellen
did
replied
edna
so
i
had
gone
piped
up
louis
i
went
with
papa
and
mamma
to
the
hotel
they
came
this
morning
and
uncle
and
aunt
came
to
take
dinner
with
us
there
o
exclaimed
edna
and
i
sent
word
by
the
telegraph
that
you
had
runned
away
what
made
you
think
that
asked
conway
edna
looked
at
louis
he
looked
rather
sheepish
but
he
was
brave
enough
to
help
edna
out
of
the
difficulty
now
that
he
had
his
father
and
mother
at
hand
why
i
i
wrote
to
edna
he
faltered
i
said
i
was
going
to
run
away
and
and
what
did
ellen
say
she
said
let
me
see
she
why
i
asked
where
you
were
and
she
said
you
were
gone
and
of
course
i
thought
you
had
run
away
and
when
she
said
aunt
and
uncle
had
followed
you
i
thought
it
must
be
so
and
i
was
in
such
trouble
i
did
know
what
to
do
to
telegraph
your
father
so
he
would
get
you
somehow
and
o
dear
i
saw
some
dreadful
cows
and
i
was
so
scared
that
i
tumbled
up
the
steps
and
porter
boys
let
me
in
then
porter
made
me
stay
and
o
just
think
of
it
i
never
knew
my
own
papa
and
mamma
were
so
near
did
you
get
my
telegram
she
asked
morrison
innocently
no
he
said
laughing
it
may
be
at
the
hotel
now
if
it
was
by
my
friends
in
pasadena
you
were
a
dear
child
to
think
of
doing
something
for
louis
although
it
turned
out
to
be
such
a
time
of
trial
i
think
said
conway
that
uncle
justus
is
the
one
who
has
had
the
hardest
time
we
knew
edna
was
safe
as
soon
as
we
reached
here
for
then
the
note
from
porter
had
been
found
poor
ellen
was
so
distressed
at
your
loss
that
she
never
once
thought
of
giving
aunt
elizabeth
the
note
you
meant
well
daughter
but
you
were
too
young
to
take
matters
into
your
own
hands
then
and
morrison
took
their
leave
and
louis
went
with
them
i
going
home
soon
he
said
to
his
cousin
say
edna
i
awfully
sorry
about
all
this
fuss
it
was
all
my
fault
but
i
did
mean
to
run
away
only
father
and
mother
came
i
very
glad
you
did
go
answered
edna
it
is
very
doubtful
if
louis
would
have
gone
any
great
distance
even
if
he
had
started
although
he
stuck
to
it
that
the
arrival
of
his
parents
alone
prevented
his
making
the
venture
o
mamma
o
mamma
it
is
really
you
said
edna
when
her
cousin
had
gone
when
am
i
going
home
with
you
in
a
few
days
replied
her
mother
uncle
justus
looking
at
her
sighed
do
you
want
to
stay
with
us
asked
aunt
elizabeth
as
if
she
too
felt
that
it
would
be
hard
to
part
with
the
dear
so
near
it
was
not
easy
to
think
of
anyone
else
but
the
feeling
sorry
for
people
was
always
ready
to
rise
in
edna
heart
and
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
poor
uncle
justus
she
did
not
like
to
leave
him
and
even
aunt
elizabeth
seemed
more
lovable
when
she
considered
the
distance
that
would
soon
be
between
them
o
she
cried
i
want
you
all
well
replied
her
father
cheerfully
i
do
know
but
what
that
can
be
managed
i
have
been
thinking
of
a
plan
which
we
will
talk
over
just
now
it
is
high
time
for
runaways
to
be
in
bed
and
with
a
kiss
all
around
edna
said
chapter
xiii
pleasant
changes
edna
stood
at
her
window
fastening
her
frock
and
looking
out
at
the
scene
before
her
she
saw
the
white
sails
in
the
far
distance
the
smoke
of
the
train
which
wound
its
way
along
the
outskirts
of
the
city
past
the
green
meadows
beyond
she
counted
over
again
the
chimneys
of
the
houses
opposite
and
and
still
another
she
would
have
her
mother
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
never
so
glad
in
her
life
all
the
unhappy
things
seemed
to
have
melted
away
like
snow
louis
was
safe
maggie
had
a
happy
home
mamma
and
papa
were
with
her
and
soon
she
should
see
sister
and
the
boys
and
edna
gave
a
long
sigh
of
content
as
she
fastened
her
last
button
and
turned
to
go
down
to
breakfast
now
mamma
what
are
we
going
to
do
she
asked
when
the
meal
was
over
i
have
concluded
not
to
let
you
return
to
school
mamma
replied
smiling
all
this
excitement
has
been
too
much
for
one
little
girl
to
stand
without
lessons
besides
the
measles
do
not
leave
one
eyes
in
the
best
condition
and
we
shall
be
going
home
in
a
day
or
two
so
it
is
not
worth
while
to
begin
for
so
short
a
time
so
we
will
go
shopping
this
morning
edna
face
beamed
o
mamma
then
we
can
get
sister
buckle
and
take
it
to
her
i
never
had
a
chance
to
go
to
many
shops
because
aunt
elizabeth
only
deals
at
one
or
two
places
and
so
i
could
not
find
the
buckle
i
promised
sister
very
well
then
i
want
to
call
upon
porter
and
thank
her
for
her
kindness
to
my
little
girl
who
has
had
so
many
rough
places
to
go
over
edna
was
thoughtful
it
has
been
very
mixy
up
has
it
mamma
so
many
things
have
happened
what
made
you
come
back
a
month
sooner
than
you
expected
because
i
was
feeling
so
much
better
and
papa
had
business
in
the
city
should
you
like
to
live
in
the
city
daughter
edna
laid
her
head
on
her
mother
shoulder
i
should
like
to
live
anywhere
that
you
are
mamma
but
i
think
it
is
nice
out
where
dorothy
evans
and
maggie
live
o
mamma
i
have
a
whole
bushel
of
things
to
tell
you
i
believe
my
tongue
will
wear
out
before
i
get
through
illustration
celia
and
truly
mamma
told
her
before
the
day
was
over
that
her
tongue
must
be
hung
in
the
middle
to
wag
at
both
ends
but
what
a
delightful
day
it
was
so
many
pretty
things
to
see
something
to
be
chosen
for
the
boys
and
for
celia
a
buckle
just
like
grace
neal
which
was
found
after
some
hunting
mamma
said
edna
i
should
like
to
get
something
for
ellen
she
has
been
so
good
to
me
of
course
replied
mamma
that
must
not
be
forgotten
and
material
for
a
pretty
frock
was
chosen
and
mamma
continued
edna
as
with
much
satisfaction
she
saw
the
breadths
measured
off
could
i
get
some
tiny
little
something
for
uncle
justus
and
aunt
elizabeth
added
mamma
said
edna
rather
doubtfully
but
but
but
what
dear
i
should
like
what
we
get
for
uncle
justus
to
be
the
nicest
conway
smiled
you
love
uncle
justus
do
you
dear
he
has
always
seemed
so
stern
and
distant
i
hardly
fancied
you
would
find
the
way
to
his
heart
but
mamma
said
edna
sagely
it
is
such
a
big
heart
when
you
do
find
your
way
there
a
remark
which
mamma
considered
a
very
wise
one
for
such
a
little
girl
to
make
what
should
you
like
to
get
for
uncle
justus
asked
conway
what
very
nice
thing
do
you
think
he
would
fancy
edna
looked
perplexed
how
would
a
nice
umbrella
do
her
mother
asked
he
might
lose
it
and
it
would
wear
out
i
want
something
that
will
not
wear
out
that
is
not
easy
to
find
although
a
book
comes
near
it
how
would
that
do
edna
shook
her
head
that
did
seem
to
please
her
and
her
eyes
wandered
around
the
shop
in
which
they
were
suddenly
she
jumped
down
from
the
high
stool
upon
which
she
had
been
sitting
i
know
she
exclaimed
a
clock
i
like
a
clock
he
have
to
wind
it
up
and
it
would
remind
him
of
me
and
i
tell
him
when
it
is
ticking
it
says
just
as
if
it
were
talking
mamma
laughed
but
thought
it
a
very
good
choice
a
pretty
little
memorandum
tablet
was
then
bought
for
aunt
elizabeth
and
the
shopping
for
that
day
was
finished
i
am
afraid
we
shall
be
too
late
for
a
noonday
meal
if
we
go
back
said
conway
i
told
aunt
elizabeth
not
to
expect
us
so
we
will
take
a
luncheon
downtown
this
was
a
very
delightful
experience
and
one
that
had
never
come
to
edna
before
therefore
she
enjoyed
her
meal
hugely
now
we
must
go
to
see
porter
said
mamma
and
edna
was
made
quite
happy
by
having
her
mother
say
that
she
quite
agreed
with
her
little
daughter
in
thinking
porter
a
very
charming
woman
and
mamma
do
you
think
we
ought
to
go
to
see
and
martin
before
we
go
home
asked
the
little
girl
to
be
sure
i
want
to
meet
all
your
friends
evans
macdonald
and
all
but
next
we
shall
have
to
go
to
the
hotel
where
your
aunt
clara
and
uncle
william
are
and
louis
added
edna
this
is
a
jolly
place
said
louis
when
the
two
children
were
left
alone
i
tell
you
i
enjoyed
my
supper
last
night
no
one
said
to
me
or
molasses
and
louis
imitation
of
aunt
elizabeth
made
edna
laugh
now
tell
me
she
said
settling
herself
in
a
big
chair
were
you
really
going
to
run
away
how
was
it
why
replied
louis
a
little
awkwardly
i
might
have
gone
but
you
see
when
i
wrote
to
father
and
mother
about
not
getting
along
well
and
all
that
and
when
uncle
justus
wrote
about
that
time
you
know
when
the
boys
were
there
and
said
i
ought
to
be
in
a
regular
school
where
i
have
companions
they
concluded
they
send
me
to
a
military
school
next
year
i
like
that
i
learn
to
drill
and
have
a
fine
time
with
boys
to
play
with
all
the
time
although
he
added
seeing
a
little
hurt
look
on
edna
face
to
tell
you
the
truth
edna
if
it
had
been
for
you
i
do
know
how
i
should
have
managed
we
did
have
some
good
times
and
you
made
me
ashamed
of
myself
lots
of
times
so
i
did
get
into
trouble
near
as
often
as
i
might
have
done
if
you
had
been
there
but
while
you
were
away
i
could
stand
it
and
i
really
did
think
i
run
away
i
should
have
stopped
on
the
way
to
say
to
you
though
but
when
father
and
mother
came
i
forgot
all
about
everything
you
see
i
tell
you
you
are
a
brick
and
stood
up
for
me
like
a
trojan
i
told
father
and
mother
all
about
it
praise
like
this
was
very
sweet
to
edna
you
stood
up
for
me
when
that
boy
that
phil
blaney
was
so
dreadful
she
made
answer
ho
that
was
nothing
i
found
out
what
a
mean
sort
of
a
chap
he
was
that
day
and
i
not
liked
him
since
i
like
charlie
stabler
much
better
say
how
will
you
like
living
here
what
do
you
mean
am
i
really
to
come
back
did
you
hear
mamma
say
so
and
you
will
not
be
here
o
dear
i
heard
some
talk
of
you
all
coming
here
to
live
that
was
what
papa
meant
then
o
i
wish
i
knew
he
in
the
other
room
now
talking
to
my
father
let
go
ask
him
and
the
children
ran
tumultuously
in
to
conway
well
i
thinking
of
it
was
his
reply
to
their
questioning
it
looks
now
as
if
my
business
would
bring
me
here
and
we
really
all
come
here
to
live
cried
edna
yes
i
think
so
o
then
o
papa
could
we
live
in
the
country
where
dorothy
evans
lives
evans
comes
to
the
city
every
day
it
is
far
conway
looked
at
his
wife
that
would
not
be
a
bad
idea
he
said
it
would
be
an
excellent
one
provided
we
can
find
the
right
place
i
think
it
would
be
much
better
for
the
children
she
replied
so
then
and
there
it
was
arranged
that
a
trip
in
that
direction
should
be
made
the
next
day
edna
will
be
so
happy
to
be
near
her
friends
said
conway
to
morrison
although
i
do
believe
the
child
would
try
to
be
contented
anywhere
she
added
she
has
a
very
helpful
spirit
returned
morrison
i
do
know
what
louis
would
have
done
without
her
she
has
been
much
braver
than
he
an
admission
which
while
perfectly
true
conway
thought
was
a
very
generous
one
for
a
mother
to
make
i
can
take
moggins
to
margaret
said
edna
delightedly
on
their
way
back
to
aunt
elizabeth
and
you
can
see
all
the
people
i
like
so
much
mamma
my
dear
miss
agnes
and
all
the
gifts
were
duly
presented
and
uncle
justus
promised
that
the
clock
should
say
to
him
and
many
a
time
after
as
he
sat
beside
the
fire
in
his
easy
chair
did
the
cheerful
ticking
remind
him
of
the
little
loving
child
the
expedition
to
the
country
was
a
great
success
moggins
behaved
beautifully
for
he
was
curled
up
asleep
in
his
basket
most
of
the
way
margaret
delight
on
again
having
him
was
good
to
see
she
was
overjoyed
at
the
possibility
of
having
edna
for
a
neighbor
and
dorothy
fairly
screamed
at
the
news
i
know
just
the
place
to
suit
you
said
miss
agnes
to
conway
it
is
about
halfway
between
here
and
the
depot
you
know
that
white
house
edna
with
the
vines
over
the
porch
and
the
big
oak
tree
on
the
lawn
it
is
so
pretty
there
in
summer
and
is
very
convenient
to
the
station
and
true
enough
it
proved
to
suit
exactly
after
this
came
the
preparations
for
returning
home
at
first
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
edna
should
be
left
with
her
aunt
and
uncle
until
after
the
removal
but
the
sight
of
the
little
wistful
disappointed
face
went
to
the
mother
heart
although
edna
made
no
protest
we
expect
too
much
of
the
child
she
said
to
her
husband
she
has
been
more
courageous
than
most
children
under
many
sore
trials
to
a
sensitive
little
heart
and
she
loves
her
pets
and
has
been
separated
from
us
all
so
long
therefore
edna
was
told
she
could
pack
up
belongings
and
make
ready
for
the
return
we
shall
not
be
ready
to
remove
for
a
couple
of
months
said
mamma
and
you
will
have
a
good
time
running
about
for
that
length
of
time
it
was
not
hard
to
say
when
there
was
such
a
near
prospect
of
coming
back
and
even
the
parting
with
louis
was
made
easy
because
he
was
to
spend
part
of
the
summer
with
his
cousins
when
we
get
to
our
new
home
we
shall
have
such
a
good
time
said
edna
the
porter
boys
can
play
with
our
boys
and
i
can
play
with
dorothy
and
margaret
and
sister
can
have
miss
agnes
and
o
it
will
be
just
splendid
it
was
very
delightful
to
be
at
home
again
to
find
everything
looking
just
the
same
to
discover
that
snowflake
was
nearly
ready
to
hatch
out
a
brood
of
chickens
that
mooly
had
a
dear
little
calf
that
the
boys
were
as
funny
as
ever
that
sister
was
so
so
glad
to
see
the
little
traveler
and
of
course
they
were
all
ready
to
chatter
and
question
and
wonder
over
the
events
which
had
taken
place
and
which
were
to
take
place
so
the
weeks
went
so
quickly
that
it
seemed
no
time
before
they
were
busy
making
preparations
for
going
to
their
new
home
by
the
end
of
the
summer
they
were
cozily
settled
in
the
white
house
and
had
found
corners
for
gardens
and
places
for
their
pets
uncle
justus
made
frequent
trips
to
see
them
and
was
consulted
on
such
grave
subjects
as
whether
a
gray
kitten
or
a
black
one
were
the
prettier
and
what
flowers
would
look
best
in
a
certain
little
garden
bordered
around
with
pebbles
he
was
taken
to
see
macdonald
and
actually
seemed
pleased
to
meet
moggins
again
a
fact
which
no
one
appeared
to
believe
when
edna
told
it
but
then
no
one
understood
uncle
justus
quite
as
well
as
this
little
niece
of
his
aunt
elizabeth
is
much
more
of
a
favorite
than
her
husband
with
people
generally
she
is
so
bland
and
affable
she
too
enjoys
an
occasional
trip
to
the
country
and
is
always
interested
in
telling
margaret
how
matters
progress
at
the
home
of
the
friendless
later
in
the
year
three
little
girls
with
the
sister
of
one
of
them
started
together
to
school
going
to
the
city
in
the
morning
and
returning
when
school
was
out
but
during
the
winter
months
when
the
days
were
shorter
they
all
remained
under
uncle
justus
roof
from
monday
until
friday
as
agnes
had
done
agnes
who
was
then
going
to
college
the
porter
boys
nice
little
fellows
are
great
friends
of
edna
brothers
and
often
come
out
to
spend
saturday
with
frank
and
charlie
louis
sometimes
comes
for
a
holiday
and
shows
himself
much
more
manly
he
is
gradually
outgrowing
his
peevishness
and
selfishness
so
that
he
bids
fair
to
be
a
fine
man
the
three
little
girls
get
along
famously
it
was
whispered
among
the
school
children
that
margaret
was
an
orphan
asylum
girl
and
there
were
some
who
disdained
her
in
consequence
but
edna
love
and
loyalty
with
dorothy
help
came
to
the
rescue
and
now
margaret
macdonald
is
one
of
the
most
popular
girls
in
the
school
she
is
so
bright
and
amiable
moreover
the
little
romance
about
her
being
lost
and
found
gives
a
zest
to
the
friendships
she
has
formed
celia
has
her
own
friends
and
is
a
great
stronghold
for
the
three
little
girls
when
matters
go
wrong
with
them
as
they
must
sometimes
do
she
has
never
found
the
way
to
the
heart
of
uncle
justus
as
edna
has
but
it
is
unlikely
that
any
one
can
do
that
for
although
the
little
clock
ticking
away
on
the
mantel
often
says
to
uncle
justus
it
often
speaks
another
name
which
he
has
given
to
his
favorite
but
which
she
has
never
heard
