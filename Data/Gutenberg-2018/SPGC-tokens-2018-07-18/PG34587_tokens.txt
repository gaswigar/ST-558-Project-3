halliburton
troubles
chapter
i
the
clergyman
daughter
in
a
very
populous
district
of
london
somewhat
north
of
temple
bar
there
stood
many
years
ago
a
low
ancient
church
amidst
other
churches
for
you
know
that
london
abounds
in
them
the
doors
of
this
church
were
partially
open
one
dark
evening
in
december
and
a
faint
glimmering
light
might
be
observed
inside
by
the
it
was
known
well
enough
what
was
going
on
within
and
why
the
light
was
there
the
rector
was
giving
away
the
weekly
bread
years
ago
a
benevolent
person
had
left
a
certain
sum
to
be
spent
in
twenty
weekly
loaves
to
be
given
to
twenty
poor
widows
at
the
discretion
of
the
minister
certain
curious
provisos
were
attached
to
the
bequest
one
was
that
the
bread
should
not
be
less
than
two
days
old
and
should
have
been
deposited
in
the
church
at
least
hours
before
distribution
another
that
each
recipient
must
attend
in
person
failing
personal
attendance
no
matter
how
unavoidable
her
absence
she
lost
the
loaf
no
friend
might
receive
it
for
her
neither
might
it
be
sent
to
her
in
that
case
the
minister
was
enjoined
to
bestow
it
upon
any
stranger
widow
who
might
present
herself
even
as
should
seem
expedient
to
him
the
word
stranger
being
of
course
used
in
to
the
twenty
poor
widows
who
were
on
the
books
as
the
charity
recipients
four
times
a
year
one
shilling
to
each
widow
was
added
to
the
loaf
of
bread
a
loaf
of
bread
is
not
very
much
to
us
sheltered
in
our
abundant
homes
it
seems
as
nothing
but
to
many
a
one
toiling
and
starving
in
this
same
city
of
london
a
loaf
may
be
almost
the
between
death
and
life
the
poor
existed
in
those
days
as
they
exist
in
these
as
they
always
will
exist
therefore
it
was
no
matter
of
surprise
that
a
crowd
of
widow
women
most
of
them
aged
all
in
poverty
should
gather
round
the
church
doors
when
the
bread
was
being
given
out
each
hoping
that
of
the
twenty
poor
widows
some
one
might
fail
to
appear
and
the
clerk
would
come
to
the
door
and
call
out
her
own
particular
name
as
the
fortunate
substitute
on
the
days
when
the
shilling
was
added
to
the
loaf
this
waiting
and
hoping
crowd
would
be
increased
thursday
was
the
afternoon
for
the
distribution
and
on
the
day
we
are
now
writing
about
the
rector
entered
the
church
at
the
usual
hour
four
he
had
to
make
his
way
through
an
unusual
number
of
outsiders
for
this
was
one
of
the
shilling
days
he
knew
them
all
personally
was
familiar
with
their
names
and
homes
for
the
rev
francis
tait
was
a
clergyman
and
clergymen
were
more
rare
in
those
days
than
they
are
in
these
of
scottish
birth
but
chiefly
reared
in
england
he
had
taken
orders
at
the
usual
age
and
become
curate
in
a
london
parish
where
the
work
was
heavy
and
the
stipend
small
not
that
the
duties
attached
to
the
church
itself
were
onerous
but
it
was
a
parish
filled
with
poor
those
familiar
with
such
parishes
know
what
this
means
when
the
minister
is
sympathising
and
conscientious
for
twenty
years
he
remained
a
curate
toiling
in
patience
cheerfully
hoping
twenty
years
it
seems
little
to
write
but
to
live
it
is
a
great
deal
and
francis
tait
in
spite
of
his
hopefulness
sometimes
found
it
so
then
promotion
came
the
living
of
this
little
church
that
you
now
see
open
was
bestowed
upon
him
a
poor
living
as
compared
with
some
others
and
a
poor
parish
speaking
of
the
social
condition
of
its
inhabitants
but
the
living
seemed
wealth
compared
with
what
he
had
earned
as
a
curate
and
as
to
his
flock
being
chiefly
composed
of
the
poor
he
had
not
been
accustomed
to
anything
else
then
the
rev
francis
tait
married
and
another
twenty
years
went
by
he
stood
in
the
church
this
evening
the
loaves
resting
on
the
shelf
overhead
against
the
door
of
the
vestry
all
near
the
entrance
a
flaring
tallow
candle
stood
on
the
small
table
between
him
and
the
widows
who
clustered
opposite
he
was
years
old
now
a
spare
man
of
middle
height
with
a
clear
pale
skin
an
intelligent
countenance
and
a
thoughtful
fine
grey
eye
he
had
a
pleasant
word
a
kind
inquiry
for
all
as
he
put
the
shilling
into
their
hands
the
lame
old
clerk
at
the
same
time
handing
over
the
loaf
of
bread
are
you
all
here
he
asked
as
the
distribution
went
on
no
sir
was
the
answer
from
several
who
spoke
at
once
betty
away
what
is
the
matter
with
her
the
rheumaticks
have
laid
hold
on
her
sir
she
could
get
here
nohow
she
in
her
bed
i
must
go
and
see
her
said
he
what
are
you
here
again
martha
he
continued
as
a
little
deformed
woman
stepped
from
behind
the
rest
where
she
had
been
hidden
i
am
glad
to
see
you
six
blessed
weeks
this
day
and
i
not
been
able
to
come
exclaimed
the
woman
but
i
restored
wonderful
the
distribution
was
approaching
its
close
when
the
rector
spoke
to
his
clerk
call
in
eliza
turner
the
clerk
placed
on
the
table
the
four
or
five
remaining
loaves
that
each
woman
might
help
herself
during
his
absence
and
went
out
to
the
door
turner
his
reverence
has
called
for
you
a
sigh
of
delight
from
eliza
turner
and
a
groan
of
disappointment
from
those
surrounding
her
greeted
the
clerk
in
answer
he
took
no
notice
he
often
heard
it
but
turned
and
limped
into
the
church
again
eliza
turner
followed
and
another
woman
slipped
in
after
eliza
turner
now
widow
booth
cried
the
clerk
sharply
perceiving
the
intrusion
what
business
have
you
here
you
know
it
again
the
rules
i
must
see
his
reverence
murmured
the
woman
pressing
on
a
meek
woman
and
she
pushed
her
way
into
the
vestry
and
told
her
pitiful
tale
i
worse
off
than
widow
turner
she
moaned
piteously
not
in
tones
of
complaint
but
of
entreaty
she
has
a
daughter
in
service
as
helps
her
but
me
i
my
poor
unfortunate
daughter
lying
in
my
place
weak
with
fever
sick
with
hunger
oh
sir
could
you
give
the
bounty
this
time
to
me
i
not
had
a
bit
or
drop
in
my
mouth
since
morning
and
then
it
was
but
a
taste
o
bread
and
a
drain
o
tea
that
a
neighbour
give
me
out
o
charity
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
discountenance
these
personal
applications
the
rector
rule
was
never
to
give
the
spare
bounty
to
those
who
applied
for
it
otherwise
the
distribution
might
have
become
a
weekly
scene
of
squabbling
and
confusion
he
handed
the
shilling
and
bread
to
eliza
turner
and
when
she
had
followed
the
other
women
out
he
turned
to
the
widow
booth
who
was
sobbing
against
the
wall
speaking
kindly
to
her
you
should
not
have
come
in
booth
you
know
that
i
do
not
allow
it
but
i
starving
sir
was
the
answer
i
thought
maybe
as
divide
it
between
me
and
widow
turner
sixpence
for
her
sixpence
for
me
and
the
loaf
halved
i
have
no
power
to
divide
the
gifts
to
do
so
would
be
against
the
terms
of
the
bequest
how
is
it
you
are
so
badly
off
this
week
has
your
work
failed
i
could
do
it
sir
with
my
sick
one
to
attend
to
and
i
a
gathering
come
on
my
thimble
finger
and
that
has
hindered
me
i
took
ninepence
the
day
before
yesterday
sir
but
last
night
it
was
every
farthing
of
it
gone
i
will
come
round
and
see
you
said
the
clergyman
she
lifted
her
eyes
yearningly
oh
sir
if
you
could
but
give
me
something
for
a
morsel
of
bread
now
i
be
grateful
for
a
penny
loaf
booth
you
know
that
to
give
here
would
be
altogether
against
my
rule
he
replied
with
unmistakable
firmness
neither
am
i
pleased
when
any
of
you
attempt
to
ask
it
go
home
quietly
i
have
said
that
i
will
come
to
you
the
woman
thanked
him
and
went
out
had
anything
been
needed
to
prove
the
necessity
of
the
rule
it
would
have
been
the
eagerness
with
which
the
crowd
of
women
gathered
round
her
not
one
of
them
had
gone
away
had
she
got
anything
to
reply
that
she
something
would
have
sent
the
whole
crowd
flocking
in
to
beg
in
turn
of
the
rector
widow
booth
shook
her
head
no
no
i
knowed
it
before
he
never
will
he
says
he
come
round
they
dispersed
some
in
one
direction
some
in
another
the
rector
blew
out
the
candle
and
he
and
the
clerk
came
forth
and
the
church
was
closed
for
the
distribution
of
bread
until
that
day
week
tait
took
the
keys
himself
to
carry
them
home
they
were
kept
at
his
house
formerly
the
clerk
had
carried
them
there
but
since
he
had
become
old
and
lame
tait
would
not
give
him
the
trouble
it
was
a
fine
night
overhead
but
the
streets
were
sloppy
and
the
clergyman
put
his
foot
unavoidably
in
many
a
puddle
the
streets
through
which
his
road
lay
were
imperfectly
lighted
the
residence
apportioned
to
the
rector
of
this
parish
was
adjoining
a
square
fashionable
in
that
day
it
was
a
very
good
house
with
a
handsome
outward
appearance
if
you
judged
by
it
you
would
have
said
the
living
must
be
worth
five
hundred
a
year
at
least
it
was
not
worth
anything
like
that
and
the
parish
treated
their
pastor
liberally
in
according
him
so
good
a
residence
a
quarter
of
an
hour
walk
from
the
church
brought
tait
to
it
until
recently
a
gentleman
had
shared
this
house
with
tait
and
his
family
the
curate
of
a
neighbouring
parish
the
rev
john
acton
had
been
glad
to
live
with
them
as
a
friend
admitted
to
their
society
and
their
table
it
was
a
little
help
and
but
for
that
and
tait
would
scarcely
have
thought
themselves
justified
in
keeping
two
servants
for
the
educational
expenses
of
their
children
ran
away
with
a
large
portion
of
their
income
but
acton
had
now
been
removed
to
a
distance
and
they
hoped
to
receive
some
one
or
other
in
his
place
on
this
evening
as
tait
was
picking
his
way
through
the
puddles
the
usual
of
his
house
presented
a
cheerful
appearance
ready
to
receive
him
it
was
on
the
ground
floor
looking
upon
the
street
large
and
lofty
and
bright
with
firelight
two
candles
not
yet
lighted
stood
on
the
table
behind
the
but
the
glow
of
the
fire
was
sufficient
for
all
the
work
that
was
being
done
in
the
room
it
was
no
work
at
all
but
play
a
young
lady
was
quietly
whirling
round
the
room
with
a
dancing
step
quietly
because
her
feet
and
movements
were
gentle
and
the
tune
she
was
humming
and
to
which
she
kept
time
was
carolled
in
an
undertone
she
was
moving
thus
in
the
happy
innocence
of
heart
and
youth
a
graceful
girl
of
middle
height
one
whom
it
gladdened
the
eye
to
look
upon
not
for
her
beauty
for
she
had
no
very
great
beauty
to
boast
of
but
it
was
one
of
those
countenances
that
win
their
own
way
to
favour
a
fair
gentle
face
openly
candid
with
the
same
earnest
honest
grey
eye
that
so
pleased
you
in
francis
tait
and
brown
hair
she
was
that
gentleman
eldest
child
and
looked
about
eighteen
in
reality
she
was
a
year
older
but
her
face
and
dress
were
both
youthful
she
wore
a
violet
silk
frock
made
with
a
low
body
and
short
sleeves
girls
did
not
keep
their
pretty
necks
and
arms
covered
up
then
by
daylight
the
dress
would
have
appeared
old
but
it
looked
very
well
by
the
sound
of
the
in
the
front
door
brought
her
dancing
to
an
end
she
knew
who
it
was
no
inmate
of
that
house
possessed
a
except
its
master
and
she
turned
to
the
fire
to
light
the
candles
tait
came
into
the
room
removing
neither
overcoat
nor
hat
have
you
made
tea
jane
no
papa
it
has
only
just
struck
five
then
i
think
i
go
out
again
first
i
have
to
call
on
one
or
two
of
the
women
and
it
will
be
all
one
wetting
my
feet
are
soaked
already
looking
down
at
his
buckled
shoes
and
black
gaiters
you
can
get
my
slippers
warmed
jane
but
the
thought
apparently
striking
him
would
your
mamma
care
to
wait
mamma
had
a
cup
of
tea
half
an
hour
ago
replied
jane
she
said
it
might
do
her
good
if
she
could
get
some
sleep
after
it
she
might
be
able
to
come
down
for
a
little
before
bedtime
the
tea
can
be
made
whenever
you
like
papa
there
only
francis
at
home
and
he
and
i
could
wait
until
ten
if
you
pleased
i
go
at
once
then
not
until
ten
miss
jane
but
until
six
or
about
that
time
betty
king
is
ill
but
does
not
live
far
off
and
i
must
step
in
to
the
widow
booth
papa
cried
jane
as
he
was
turning
away
i
forgot
to
tell
you
francis
says
he
thinks
he
knows
of
a
gentleman
who
would
like
to
come
here
in
acton
place
ah
who
is
it
asked
the
rector
one
of
the
masters
at
the
school
here
francis
coming
down
he
only
went
up
to
wash
his
hands
it
is
our
new
mathematical
master
sir
cried
francis
tait
a
youth
of
eighteen
who
was
being
brought
up
to
the
church
i
overheard
him
ask
percy
if
he
could
recommend
him
to
a
comfortable
house
where
he
might
board
and
make
one
of
the
family
so
i
told
him
perhaps
you
might
receive
him
here
he
said
he
come
down
and
see
you
tait
paused
would
he
be
a
desirable
inmate
think
you
francis
is
he
a
gentleman
quite
a
gentleman
i
am
sure
replied
francis
and
we
all
like
what
little
we
have
seen
of
him
his
name
halliburton
is
he
in
orders
no
he
intends
to
be
i
think
well
of
course
i
can
say
nothing
about
it
one
way
or
the
other
concluded
tait
as
he
went
out
jane
stood
before
the
fire
in
thought
her
fingers
unconsciously
smoothing
the
parting
of
the
glossy
brown
hair
on
her
head
as
she
looked
at
it
in
the
to
say
that
she
never
did
such
a
thing
in
vanity
would
be
wrong
no
pretty
girl
ever
lived
but
was
conscious
of
her
good
looks
jane
however
was
neither
thinking
of
herself
nor
of
vanity
just
then
she
took
a
very
practical
part
in
home
duties
with
her
mother
a
practical
part
amidst
her
father
poor
and
at
this
moment
her
thoughts
were
running
on
the
additional
work
it
might
bring
her
should
this
gentleman
come
to
reside
with
them
what
did
you
say
his
name
was
francis
she
suddenly
asked
of
her
brother
whose
that
gentleman
the
new
master
at
your
school
halliburton
i
do
know
his
christian
name
i
wonder
mused
jane
aloud
whether
he
will
wear
out
his
stockings
as
acton
did
there
was
always
a
dreadful
amount
of
darning
to
be
done
to
his
is
he
an
old
guy
francis
is
he
responded
francis
tait
do
faint
when
you
see
some
one
come
in
old
and
fat
with
green
rims
to
his
spectacles
i
do
say
old
enough
to
be
papa
father
but
why
he
must
be
eighty
then
at
least
uttered
jane
in
dismay
how
could
you
propose
it
to
him
we
should
not
care
to
have
any
one
older
than
mr
acton
acton
that
young
chicken
contemptuously
rejoined
francis
put
him
by
the
side
of
halliburton
acton
was
barely
fifty
he
was
i
think
said
jane
oh
dear
how
i
should
like
to
have
gone
with
margaret
and
robert
this
evening
she
exclaimed
forgetting
the
passing
topic
in
another
they
were
not
polite
enough
to
invite
me
said
francis
i
shall
pay
the
old
lady
out
jane
laughed
you
are
growing
too
old
now
francis
to
be
admitted
to
a
young
ladies
party
chilham
said
so
to
mamma
jane
words
were
interrupted
by
a
knock
at
the
front
door
apparently
that
of
a
visitor
jane
cried
her
brother
in
some
trepidation
i
should
not
wonder
if
it
halliburton
he
did
not
say
when
he
should
come
another
minute
and
one
of
the
servants
ushered
a
gentleman
into
the
room
it
was
not
an
old
guy
however
as
jane
saw
at
a
glance
with
a
distinct
feeling
of
relief
a
tall
gentlemanlike
man
of
five
or
six
and
twenty
with
thin
aquiline
features
dark
eyes
and
a
clear
fresh
complexion
a
handsome
man
very
prepossessing
you
see
i
have
soon
availed
myself
of
your
permission
to
call
said
he
in
pleasant
tones
as
he
took
francis
tait
hand
and
glanced
towards
jane
with
a
slight
bow
my
sister
jane
sir
said
francis
jane
this
is
mr
halliburton
jane
for
once
lost
her
so
surprised
was
she
in
fact
perplexed
for
she
did
not
know
whether
francis
was
playing
a
trick
upon
her
now
or
whether
he
had
previously
played
it
in
short
whether
this
was
or
was
not
halliburton
that
she
could
only
look
from
one
to
the
other
are
you
mr
halliburton
she
said
in
her
straightforward
simplicity
i
am
halliburton
he
answered
bending
to
her
politely
can
i
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
mr
tait
will
you
take
a
seat
said
jane
papa
is
out
but
i
do
not
think
he
will
be
very
long
where
did
he
go
to
do
you
know
jane
cried
francis
who
was
smothering
a
laugh
to
betty
king
and
to
widow
booth
he
may
have
been
going
elsewhere
also
i
think
he
was
at
any
rate
i
just
run
there
and
see
jane
you
can
tell
halliburton
all
about
it
whilst
i
am
away
explain
to
him
exactly
how
he
will
be
here
and
how
we
live
and
then
you
can
decide
for
yourself
sir
concluded
francis
to
splash
through
the
wet
streets
to
betty
king
or
elsewhere
was
an
expedition
rather
agreeable
to
francis
in
his
eagerness
otherwise
there
was
no
particular
necessity
for
his
going
i
am
sorry
mamma
is
not
up
said
jane
she
suffers
from
occasional
and
they
generally
keep
her
in
bed
for
the
day
i
will
give
you
any
information
in
my
power
your
brother
francis
thought
that
it
might
not
be
disagreeable
to
tait
to
receive
a
stranger
into
his
family
said
halliburton
speaking
with
some
hesitation
but
the
young
lady
before
him
looked
so
the
house
altogether
seemed
so
well
appointed
that
he
almost
doubted
whether
the
proposal
would
not
offend
her
we
wish
to
receive
some
one
said
jane
the
house
is
sufficiently
large
to
do
so
and
papa
would
like
it
for
the
sake
of
society
as
well
as
that
it
would
help
in
our
housekeeping
she
added
in
her
candour
a
friend
of
papa
was
with
us
i
can
not
remember
precisely
how
many
years
but
he
came
when
i
was
a
little
girl
it
was
the
rev
acton
he
left
us
last
october
i
feel
sure
that
i
should
like
it
very
much
and
i
should
think
myself
fortunate
if
tait
would
admit
me
spoke
the
visitor
jane
remembered
the
suggestion
of
francis
and
deemed
it
her
duty
to
speak
a
little
to
halliburton
of
how
he
would
be
there
as
it
had
been
expressed
she
might
have
done
so
without
the
suggestion
for
she
could
not
be
otherwise
than
straightforward
and
open
we
live
very
plainly
she
observed
a
simple
joint
of
meat
one
day
cold
with
a
pudding
the
next
i
should
consider
myself
fortunate
to
get
the
pudding
replied
halliburton
smiling
i
have
been
tossed
about
a
good
deal
of
late
years
miss
tait
and
have
not
come
in
for
too
much
comfort
just
now
i
am
in
very
uncomfortable
lodgings
i
dare
say
papa
would
like
to
have
you
said
jane
frankly
with
a
sort
of
relief
she
had
thought
he
looked
one
who
might
be
fastidious
i
have
neither
father
nor
mother
brother
nor
sister
he
resumed
in
fact
i
may
say
that
i
am
without
relatives
for
almost
the
only
one
i
have
has
discarded
me
i
often
think
how
rich
those
people
must
be
who
possess
close
connections
and
a
happy
home
he
added
turning
his
bright
glance
upon
her
jane
dropped
her
work
which
she
had
taken
up
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
without
all
my
dear
relatives
she
exclaimed
are
you
a
large
family
we
are
six
papa
and
mamma
and
four
children
i
am
the
eldest
and
margaret
is
the
youngest
francis
and
robert
are
between
us
it
is
night
at
margaret
school
and
she
has
gone
to
it
with
robert
continued
jane
never
doubting
but
the
stranger
must
take
as
much
interest
in
nights
as
she
did
i
was
to
have
gone
but
mamma
has
been
unusually
ill
were
you
disappointed
jane
bent
her
head
while
she
confessed
the
fact
as
though
feeling
it
a
confession
to
be
ashamed
of
it
would
not
have
been
kind
to
leave
mamma
she
added
and
i
dare
say
some
other
pleasure
will
arise
soon
mamma
is
asleep
now
what
a
charming
girl
thought
halliburton
to
himself
how
i
wish
she
was
my
sister
margaret
is
to
be
a
governess
observed
jane
and
is
being
educated
for
it
she
has
great
talent
for
music
and
also
for
drawing
it
is
not
often
the
two
are
united
her
tastes
lie
quite
that
way
anything
clever
and
as
papa
has
no
money
to
give
us
it
was
well
to
make
her
a
governess
and
you
said
halliburton
the
question
might
have
been
thought
an
impertinent
one
by
many
but
he
spoke
it
only
in
his
deep
interest
and
jane
tait
was
of
too
ingenuous
a
disposition
not
to
answer
it
as
openly
i
am
not
to
be
a
governess
i
am
to
stay
at
home
with
mamma
and
help
her
there
is
plenty
to
do
margaret
can
not
bear
domestic
duties
or
sewing
either
dancing
excepted
i
have
not
learnt
a
single
accomplishment
unless
you
call
french
an
accomplishment
i
am
sure
you
have
been
well
educated
involuntarily
spoke
halliburton
yes
in
all
things
solid
replied
jane
papa
has
taken
care
of
that
he
still
directs
my
reading
i
know
a
good
bit
of
latin
she
added
bringing
out
the
concluding
words
with
hesitation
as
one
who
repents
his
sentence
though
i
do
not
like
to
confess
it
to
you
why
do
you
not
because
i
think
girls
who
know
latin
are
laughed
at
i
did
not
regularly
learn
it
but
i
used
to
be
in
the
room
when
papa
or
acton
was
teaching
francis
and
robert
and
i
picked
it
up
unconsciously
acton
often
took
francis
he
had
more
time
on
his
hands
than
papa
francis
is
to
be
a
clergyman
miss
jane
said
a
servant
entering
the
room
tait
is
awake
and
wishes
to
see
you
jane
left
halliburton
with
a
word
of
apology
and
almost
immediately
after
tait
came
in
he
was
a
little
taken
to
when
he
saw
the
stranger
his
imagination
had
run
if
not
upon
an
old
guy
in
spectacles
certainly
upon
some
steady
sober
mathematical
master
would
it
be
well
to
admit
this
young
man
to
his
house
if
jane
tait
had
been
candid
in
her
revelations
to
halliburton
that
gentleman
in
his
turn
was
not
less
candid
to
her
father
he
edgar
halliburton
was
the
only
child
of
a
country
clergyman
the
rev
william
halliburton
who
had
died
when
edgar
was
sixteen
leaving
nothing
behind
him
edgar
he
had
previously
lost
his
mother
found
a
home
with
his
late
mother
brother
a
gentleman
named
cooper
who
resided
in
birmingham
cooper
was
a
man
in
extensive
wholesale
business
and
wished
edgar
to
go
into
his
edgar
declined
his
father
had
lived
long
enough
to
form
his
tastes
his
greatest
wish
had
been
to
see
him
enter
the
church
and
the
wish
had
become
edgar
own
cooper
thought
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
like
business
and
looked
upon
that
most
sacred
of
all
callings
god
ministry
only
in
the
light
of
a
profession
he
had
carved
out
his
own
career
step
by
step
attaining
wealth
and
importance
and
wished
his
nephew
to
do
the
same
which
is
best
lad
he
coarsely
asked
to
rule
as
a
merchant
prince
or
starve
and
toil
as
a
curate
i
not
quite
a
merchant
prince
yet
but
you
may
be
it
was
my
father
wish
pleaded
edgar
in
answer
and
it
is
my
own
i
can
not
give
it
up
sir
the
dispute
ran
high
not
in
words
but
in
obstinacy
edgar
would
not
yield
and
at
length
cooper
discarded
him
he
turned
him
out
of
doors
told
him
that
if
he
must
become
a
parson
he
might
get
some
one
else
to
pay
his
expenses
at
oxford
for
he
never
would
edgar
halliburton
proceeded
to
london
and
obtained
employment
as
an
usher
in
a
school
teaching
classics
and
mathematics
from
that
he
became
a
private
teacher
and
had
so
earned
his
living
up
to
the
present
time
but
he
had
never
succeeded
in
getting
to
college
and
tait
before
they
had
talked
together
five
minutes
was
charmed
with
his
visitor
and
invited
him
to
take
tea
with
him
which
jane
came
down
to
make
has
your
uncle
never
softened
towards
you
tait
inquired
never
i
have
addressed
several
letters
to
him
but
they
have
been
returned
to
me
he
has
no
family
you
say
you
ought
in
justice
you
ought
to
inherit
some
of
his
wealth
has
he
other
relatives
he
has
one
standing
to
him
in
the
same
relationship
as
i
my
cousin
julia
it
is
not
likely
that
i
shall
ever
inherit
a
shilling
of
it
sir
i
do
not
expect
it
right
said
tait
nodding
his
head
approvingly
there
no
work
so
thriftless
as
that
of
waiting
for
legacies
wearying
too
i
was
a
poor
curate
halliburton
for
twenty
years
indeed
so
far
as
being
poor
goes
i
am
not
much
else
now
but
let
that
pass
i
had
a
relative
who
possessed
money
and
who
had
neither
kith
nor
kin
nearer
to
her
than
i
was
for
the
best
part
of
those
twenty
years
i
was
giving
covert
hopes
to
that
money
and
when
she
died
and
nothing
was
left
to
me
i
found
out
how
foolish
and
wasteful
my
hopes
had
been
i
tell
my
children
to
trust
to
their
own
honest
exertions
but
never
to
trust
to
other
people
money
allow
me
to
urge
the
same
upon
you
halliburton
lips
and
eyes
alike
smiled
as
he
looked
gratefully
at
the
rector
a
man
so
much
older
than
himself
i
never
think
of
it
he
earnestly
said
it
appears
for
me
to
be
as
thoroughly
lost
as
though
it
did
not
exist
i
should
not
have
mentioned
it
sir
but
that
i
consider
it
right
you
should
know
all
particulars
respecting
me
if
as
i
hope
you
will
admit
me
to
your
home
i
think
we
should
get
on
very
well
together
frankly
acknowledged
tait
forgetting
the
prudent
ideas
which
had
crossed
his
mind
i
am
sure
we
should
sir
warmly
replied
edgar
halliburton
and
the
bargain
was
made
chapter
ii
the
shadow
becomes
substance
and
yet
it
had
perhaps
been
well
that
those
prudent
ideas
had
been
allowed
to
obtain
weight
halliburton
took
up
his
abode
with
the
taits
and
the
more
they
saw
of
him
the
more
they
liked
him
in
which
liking
jane
must
be
included
it
was
a
possible
shadow
of
the
future
the
effects
the
step
would
bring
forth
which
had
whispered
determent
to
tait
a
very
brief
shadow
which
had
crossed
his
mind
imperfectly
and
flitted
away
again
where
two
young
and
attractive
beings
are
thrown
into
daily
companionship
the
result
too
frequently
is
that
a
mutual
regard
arises
stronger
than
any
other
regard
can
ever
be
in
this
world
this
result
arrived
here
a
twelvemonth
passed
over
from
the
time
of
entrance
how
swiftly
for
him
and
for
jane
tait
they
alone
could
tell
not
a
word
had
been
spoken
to
her
by
halliburton
that
he
might
not
have
spoken
to
her
mother
or
her
sister
margaret
not
a
look
on
part
had
been
given
by
which
he
could
infer
that
he
was
more
to
her
than
the
rest
of
the
world
and
yet
both
were
inwardly
conscious
of
the
feelings
of
the
other
and
when
the
twelvemonth
had
gone
by
it
had
seemed
to
them
but
a
span
for
the
love
they
bore
each
other
one
evening
in
december
jane
stood
in
the
waiting
to
make
tea
just
as
she
had
so
waited
that
former
evening
for
any
outward
signs
you
might
have
thought
that
not
a
single
hour
had
elapsed
since
their
first
introduction
that
it
was
the
same
evening
as
of
old
it
was
sloppy
outside
it
was
bright
within
the
candles
stood
on
the
table
unlighted
the
fire
blazed
the
was
placed
and
only
jane
was
there
tait
was
upstairs
with
one
of
her
frequent
margaret
was
with
her
and
the
others
had
not
come
in
jane
stood
in
a
reverie
her
elbow
resting
on
the
and
the
blaze
from
the
fire
flickering
on
her
gentle
face
she
was
fond
of
these
few
minutes
of
idleness
on
a
winter
evening
between
the
twilight
hour
and
lighting
the
candles
the
clock
in
the
kitchen
struck
five
it
did
not
arouse
her
she
heard
it
in
a
mechanical
sort
of
manner
without
taking
note
of
it
scarcely
had
the
sound
of
the
last
stroke
died
away
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
front
door
that
aroused
her
for
she
knew
it
she
knew
the
footsteps
that
came
in
when
it
was
answered
and
a
rich
damask
arose
to
her
cheeks
and
the
pulses
of
her
heart
went
on
a
little
quicker
than
they
had
been
going
before
she
took
her
elbow
from
the
and
sat
down
quietly
on
a
chair
no
need
to
look
who
entered
some
one
taller
by
far
than
any
in
that
house
came
up
to
the
fire
and
bent
to
warm
his
hands
over
the
blaze
it
is
a
cold
night
jane
we
shall
have
a
severe
frost
yes
she
answered
the
water
in
the
barrel
is
already
freezing
over
how
is
your
mamma
now
better
thank
you
margaret
has
gone
up
to
help
her
to
dress
she
is
coming
down
to
tea
halliburton
remained
silent
a
minute
and
then
turned
to
jane
his
face
glowing
with
satisfaction
i
have
had
a
piece
of
preferment
offered
me
have
you
she
eagerly
said
what
is
it
percy
proposes
that
from
january
i
shall
take
the
greek
classes
as
well
as
the
mathematics
and
he
doubles
my
salary
of
course
i
shall
have
to
give
closer
attendance
but
i
can
readily
do
that
my
time
is
not
fully
employed
i
am
very
glad
said
jane
so
am
i
he
answered
taking
all
my
sources
of
income
together
i
shall
now
be
earning
two
hundred
and
pounds
a
year
jane
laughed
have
you
been
reckoning
it
up
ay
i
had
a
motive
in
doing
so
his
tone
was
peculiar
and
it
caused
her
to
look
at
him
but
her
eyelids
drooped
under
his
gaze
he
drew
nearer
and
laid
his
hand
gently
on
her
shoulder
bending
down
before
her
to
speak
jane
you
have
not
mistaken
me
i
feel
that
you
have
read
what
has
been
in
my
heart
what
have
been
my
intentions
as
surely
as
though
i
had
spoken
it
is
not
a
great
income
but
it
is
sufficient
if
you
can
think
it
so
may
i
speak
to
mr
tait
what
jane
would
have
contrived
to
answer
she
never
knew
but
at
that
moment
her
mother
step
was
heard
approaching
all
she
did
was
to
glance
shyly
up
at
halliburton
and
he
bent
his
head
lower
and
kissed
her
then
he
walked
rapidly
to
the
door
and
opened
it
for
tait
a
pale
refined
lady
wrapped
in
a
shawl
these
violent
headaches
from
which
she
so
frequently
suffered
did
not
affect
her
permanent
health
but
on
the
days
she
suffered
she
would
be
utterly
prostrated
halliburton
gave
her
his
arm
and
led
her
to
a
seat
by
the
fire
his
voice
low
and
tender
his
manner
sympathizing
i
am
already
better
she
said
to
him
and
shall
be
much
better
after
tea
sometimes
i
am
tempted
to
envy
those
who
do
not
know
what
a
is
they
may
know
other
maladies
as
painful
dear
mrs
tait
ay
indeed
none
of
us
can
expect
to
be
free
from
pain
of
one
sort
or
another
in
this
world
shall
i
make
the
tea
mamma
asked
jane
yes
dear
i
shall
be
glad
of
it
and
your
papa
is
sure
to
be
in
soon
there
he
is
she
added
as
the
was
heard
in
the
door
the
boys
are
late
this
evening
the
rector
came
in
and
ere
the
evening
was
over
the
news
was
broken
to
him
by
halliburton
he
wanted
jane
it
was
the
imperfect
uncertain
shadow
of
twelve
months
ago
become
substance
it
had
been
a
shadow
of
the
future
only
you
understand
not
a
shadow
of
evil
to
halliburton
personally
the
rector
had
no
objection
he
had
learned
to
love
esteem
and
respect
him
but
it
is
a
serious
thing
to
give
away
a
child
the
income
is
very
small
to
marry
upon
he
observed
it
is
also
uncertain
not
uncertain
sir
so
long
as
i
am
blessed
with
health
and
strength
and
i
have
no
reason
to
fear
that
these
will
fail
i
thought
you
were
bent
on
taking
orders
halliburton
cheek
slightly
flushed
it
is
a
prospect
i
have
fondly
cherished
he
said
but
its
difficulties
alarm
me
the
cost
of
the
university
is
great
and
were
i
to
wait
until
i
had
saved
sufficient
money
to
go
to
college
i
should
be
obliged
in
a
great
degree
to
give
up
my
present
means
of
living
who
would
employ
a
tutor
who
must
frequently
be
away
for
weeks
i
should
lose
my
connection
and
perhaps
never
regain
it
a
good
teaching
connection
is
more
easily
lost
than
won
true
observed
tait
once
in
orders
i
might
remain
for
years
a
poor
curate
i
should
most
likely
do
so
i
have
neither
interest
nor
influence
sir
in
that
case
jane
and
i
might
be
obliged
to
wait
for
years
perhaps
go
down
to
our
graves
waiting
the
rev
francis
tait
threw
back
his
thoughts
how
had
waited
how
he
was
not
able
to
marry
until
years
were
advancing
upon
him
how
in
four
years
now
he
should
have
attained
threescore
years
and
ten
the
term
allotted
to
the
life
of
man
whilst
his
children
were
still
growing
up
around
him
no
never
never
would
he
counsel
another
to
wait
as
he
had
been
obliged
to
wait
i
have
not
yet
given
up
hope
of
eventually
entering
the
church
continued
halliburton
though
it
must
be
accomplished
if
at
all
slowly
and
patiently
i
think
i
may
be
able
to
keep
one
term
or
perhaps
two
terms
yearly
without
damage
to
my
teaching
i
shall
try
to
do
so
try
to
find
the
necessary
means
and
time
my
marriage
will
make
no
difference
to
that
sir
many
might
have
suggested
to
edgar
halliburton
that
he
might
keep
his
terms
first
and
marry
afterwards
tait
did
not
possibly
the
idea
did
not
occur
to
him
if
it
occurred
to
edgar
halliburton
himself
he
drove
it
from
him
it
would
have
delayed
his
marriage
to
an
indefinite
number
of
years
and
he
loved
jane
too
well
to
do
that
willingly
i
shall
still
get
much
better
preferment
in
teaching
than
that
which
i
now
hold
he
urged
aloud
to
the
rector
it
is
not
so
very
small
to
begin
upon
sir
and
jane
is
willing
to
risk
it
i
will
not
part
you
and
jane
said
tait
warmly
if
you
have
made
up
your
minds
to
share
life
and
its
cares
together
you
shall
do
so
still
i
can
not
say
that
i
think
your
prospects
golden
prospects
that
appear
to
have
no
gold
at
all
in
them
sometimes
turn
out
very
brightly
sir
i
can
give
jane
nothing
you
know
i
have
never
cast
a
thought
to
it
sir
have
never
imagined
she
would
have
a
shilling
replied
halliburton
his
face
flushing
with
eagerness
it
is
jane
herself
i
want
not
money
beyond
a
note
which
i
may
give
her
to
put
into
her
purse
on
her
wedding
morning
that
she
may
not
leave
my
house
absolutely
penniless
she
will
have
nothing
cried
the
rector
in
his
straightforward
manner
far
from
saving
i
and
her
mother
have
been
hardly
able
to
make
both
ends
meet
at
the
end
of
the
year
i
might
have
saved
a
few
pounds
yearly
had
i
chosen
to
do
so
but
you
know
what
this
parish
is
and
the
reflection
has
always
been
upon
me
how
would
my
master
look
upon
my
putting
by
small
sums
of
money
when
many
of
those
over
whom
i
am
placed
were
literally
starving
for
bread
i
have
given
what
i
could
but
i
have
not
saved
for
my
children
you
have
done
well
sir
tait
sought
his
daughter
jane
he
began
nay
child
do
not
tremble
so
there
is
no
need
for
trembling
or
for
tears
either
you
have
done
nothing
to
displease
me
jane
i
like
edgar
halliburton
i
like
him
much
there
is
no
one
to
whom
i
would
rather
give
you
but
i
do
not
like
his
prospects
teaching
is
very
precarious
jane
raised
her
timid
eyes
precarious
for
papa
for
one
learned
and
clever
as
he
it
is
badly
paid
see
how
he
toils
and
he
will
have
to
toil
more
when
the
new
year
comes
in
and
only
to
earn
two
or
three
hundred
a
year
in
round
numbers
tears
gathered
in
jane
eyes
toil
as
he
did
badly
paid
as
he
might
be
she
would
rather
have
him
than
any
other
in
the
world
though
that
other
might
have
revelled
in
thousands
the
rector
read
somewhat
of
this
in
her
downcast
face
my
dear
the
consideration
lies
with
you
if
you
choose
to
venture
upon
it
you
shall
have
my
consent
and
i
know
you
will
have
your
mother
for
she
thinks
edgar
halliburton
has
not
his
equal
in
the
world
but
it
may
bring
you
many
troubles
papa
i
am
not
afraid
if
troubles
come
they
you
told
us
only
last
night
what
child
that
troubles
regarded
rightly
only
lead
us
nearer
to
god
whispered
jane
simply
and
timidly
right
child
and
trouble
must
come
before
that
great
truth
can
be
realized
consider
the
question
well
jane
whether
it
may
not
be
better
to
wait
and
give
your
answer
i
shall
tell
halliburton
not
to
ask
for
it
as
you
decide
so
shall
it
be
need
you
be
told
what
jane
decision
was
two
hundred
and
pounds
a
year
seems
a
large
sum
to
an
inexperienced
girl
quite
sufficient
to
purchase
everything
that
might
be
wanted
for
a
fireside
and
so
she
became
jane
halliburton
chapter
iii
the
rev
francis
tait
a
hot
afternoon
in
july
jane
halliburton
was
in
the
with
her
mother
both
sewing
busily
it
was
a
large
room
with
three
windows
more
pleasant
than
the
beneath
and
they
were
fond
of
sitting
in
it
in
summer
jane
had
been
married
some
three
or
four
months
now
but
looked
the
same
young
simple
placid
girl
that
she
ever
did
and
but
for
the
upon
her
finger
no
stranger
would
have
supposed
her
to
be
a
wife
an
excellent
arrangement
had
been
arrived
at
that
she
and
her
husband
should
remain
inmates
of
tait
house
at
any
rate
for
the
present
when
plans
were
being
discussed
before
making
the
necessary
arrangements
for
the
marriage
and
halliburton
was
spending
all
his
superfluous
minutes
hunting
for
a
suitable
house
near
to
the
old
home
and
not
too
dear
francis
tait
had
given
utterance
to
a
remark
i
wonder
who
we
shall
get
here
in
halliburton
place
if
papa
takes
any
one
else
and
margaret
looking
up
from
her
drawing
had
added
why
ca
halliburton
and
jane
stay
on
with
us
it
would
be
so
much
pleasanter
it
was
the
first
time
the
idea
had
been
presented
in
any
shape
to
the
rector
and
it
seemed
to
go
straight
to
his
wishes
he
put
down
a
book
he
was
reading
and
spoke
impulsively
it
would
be
the
best
thing
the
very
best
thing
would
you
like
it
halliburton
i
should
sir
very
much
but
it
is
jane
who
must
be
consulted
not
me
jane
her
pretty
cheeks
covered
with
blushes
looked
up
and
said
she
should
like
it
also
she
thought
of
it
but
had
not
liked
to
mention
it
either
to
her
mother
or
to
halliburton
i
have
been
quite
troubled
to
think
what
mamma
and
the
house
will
do
without
me
she
added
ingenuously
let
jane
alone
for
thinking
and
planning
when
difficulties
are
in
the
way
laughed
margaret
my
opinion
is
that
we
shall
never
get
another
pudding
or
papa
have
his
black
silk
sunday
hose
darned
if
jane
goes
from
us
tait
burst
into
tears
like
margaret
she
was
a
bad
manager
and
had
mourned
over
jane
departure
secretly
believing
she
should
be
half
worried
to
death
oh
jane
dear
say
you
remain
she
cried
it
will
be
such
a
relief
to
me
margaret
of
no
earthly
use
and
everything
will
fall
on
my
shoulders
edgar
i
hope
you
will
remain
with
us
it
will
be
pleasant
for
all
you
know
the
house
is
sufficiently
large
and
remain
they
did
the
wedding
took
place
at
easter
and
halliburton
took
jane
all
the
way
to
dover
to
see
the
sea
a
long
way
in
those
days
and
kept
her
there
for
a
week
and
then
they
came
back
again
jane
to
her
old
home
duties
just
as
though
she
were
jane
tait
still
and
halliburton
to
his
teaching
it
was
july
now
and
hot
weather
and
tait
and
jane
were
sewing
in
the
they
were
working
for
margaret
halliburton
through
some
of
his
teaching
connections
had
obtained
an
excellent
situation
for
margaret
in
a
school
margaret
was
to
enter
as
resident
pupil
and
receive
every
advantage
towards
the
completion
of
her
own
education
in
return
for
which
she
was
to
teach
the
younger
pupils
music
and
pay
ten
pounds
a
year
such
an
arrangement
was
almost
unknown
then
though
it
has
been
common
enough
since
and
and
tait
thought
of
it
very
highly
margaret
tait
was
only
sixteen
but
as
if
in
contrast
to
jane
who
looked
younger
than
her
actual
years
margaret
looked
older
in
appearance
in
manners
and
also
in
advancement
margaret
might
have
been
eighteen
she
was
to
enter
the
school
which
was
near
harrow
in
another
week
at
the
termination
of
the
holidays
and
tait
and
jane
had
their
hands
full
getting
her
things
ready
was
this
slip
measured
mamma
jane
suddenly
asked
after
attentively
regarding
the
work
she
had
on
her
knee
i
think
so
replied
tait
why
it
looks
too
short
for
margaret
at
least
it
will
be
too
short
when
i
have
finished
this
fourth
tuck
it
must
have
been
measured
though
for
here
are
the
pins
in
it
perhaps
margaret
measured
it
herself
then
of
course
it
must
be
measured
again
there
no
trusting
to
anything
margaret
does
in
the
shape
of
work
and
yet
how
clever
she
is
at
music
and
drawing
in
fact
at
all
her
studies
added
tait
it
is
well
jane
that
we
are
not
all
gifted
alike
i
think
it
is
acquiesced
jane
i
will
go
up
to
margaret
room
for
one
of
her
slips
and
measure
this
you
need
not
do
that
said
tait
there
an
old
slip
of
hers
amongst
the
work
on
the
sofa
jane
found
the
slip
and
measured
the
one
in
her
hand
by
it
yes
mamma
it
is
just
the
length
without
the
tuck
then
i
must
take
out
what
i
have
done
of
it
it
is
very
little
come
hither
jane
your
eyes
are
younger
than
mine
is
not
that
your
papa
coming
towards
us
from
the
far
end
of
the
square
jane
approached
the
window
nearest
to
her
not
the
one
at
which
tait
was
sitting
oh
yes
that
papa
you
might
tell
him
by
his
dress
if
by
nothing
else
mamma
i
could
tell
him
by
himself
if
i
could
see
said
tait
quaintly
i
do
know
how
it
is
jane
but
my
sight
grows
very
imperfect
for
a
distance
never
mind
that
mamma
so
that
you
can
continue
to
see
well
to
work
and
read
said
jane
cheerily
how
fast
papa
is
walking
very
fast
for
the
rev
francis
tait
who
was
not
in
general
a
quick
walker
he
entered
his
house
and
came
up
to
the
he
had
not
been
well
for
the
last
few
days
and
threw
himself
into
a
chair
wearily
jane
is
there
any
of
that
left
that
was
made
for
me
yesterday
yes
papa
she
said
springing
up
that
she
might
get
it
for
him
i
will
bring
it
to
you
immediately
stay
stay
child
not
so
fast
he
interrupted
it
is
not
for
myself
i
can
do
without
it
i
have
been
pained
by
a
sad
sight
he
added
looking
at
his
wife
there
that
daughter
of
the
widow
booth
come
home
again
i
called
in
upon
them
and
there
she
was
lying
on
a
mattress
dying
from
famine
as
i
verily
believe
she
returned
last
night
in
a
dreadful
state
of
exhaustion
the
mother
says
and
has
had
nothing
within
her
lips
since
but
cold
water
they
tried
her
with
solid
food
but
she
could
not
swallow
it
that
will
just
do
for
her
have
it
warmed
jane
she
is
a
sinful
girl
francis
remarked
tait
and
does
not
really
deserve
compassion
all
the
more
reason
wife
that
she
should
be
rescued
from
death
said
the
rector
almost
sternly
the
good
may
dare
to
die
the
evil
may
not
do
waste
time
jane
put
it
into
a
bottle
warm
and
i
carry
it
round
is
there
nothing
else
we
can
send
her
papa
that
may
do
for
her
equally
well
asked
jane
a
little
wine
perhaps
there
is
very
little
of
the
left
and
it
ought
to
be
kept
for
you
never
mind
i
wish
to
take
it
to
her
said
the
rector
a
little
wine
afterwards
may
do
her
good
jane
hastened
to
the
kitchen
disturbing
a
servant
who
was
doing
something
over
the
fire
susan
papa
wants
the
remainder
of
the
warmed
will
you
make
haste
and
do
it
whilst
i
search
for
a
bottle
to
put
it
into
it
is
to
be
taken
round
to
charity
booth
what
is
back
again
exclaimed
the
servant
slightingly
which
betrayed
that
her
estimation
of
charity
booth
was
no
higher
than
was
that
of
her
mistress
it
just
like
the
master
she
continued
proceeding
to
do
what
was
required
of
her
it
not
often
that
anything
made
for
himself
but
if
it
is
he
never
gets
the
benefit
of
it
he
sure
to
drop
across
somebody
that
he
fancies
wants
it
worse
than
he
does
it
not
right
miss
jane
jane
was
searching
a
cupboard
and
brought
forth
a
clean
green
bottle
which
held
about
this
will
be
quite
large
enough
i
think
i
should
think
it
would
grumbled
susan
who
could
not
be
brought
to
look
upon
the
giving
away
of
her
master
own
peculiar
property
as
anything
but
a
personal
grievance
there
barely
a
gill
of
it
left
and
he
ought
to
have
had
it
himself
miss
jane
susan
she
said
turning
her
bright
face
laughingly
towards
the
woman
it
is
a
good
thing
that
you
went
to
church
and
saw
me
married
or
i
might
think
you
meant
to
reflect
upon
me
how
can
i
be
jane
with
this
ring
on
it
of
no
good
my
trying
to
remember
it
all
the
parish
knows
you
are
halliburton
fast
enough
but
it
do
come
ready
to
me
jane
laughed
pleasantly
where
is
mary
she
asked
in
the
back
room
going
on
with
some
of
miss
margaret
things
cooler
sitting
there
than
in
this
hot
kitchen
jane
carried
the
little
bottle
of
to
her
father
and
gave
it
into
his
hand
he
looked
very
pale
and
rose
from
his
chair
slowly
oh
papa
you
do
not
seem
well
she
involuntarily
exclaimed
let
me
run
and
beat
you
up
an
egg
i
will
not
be
a
minute
i
ca
wait
child
and
i
question
if
i
could
eat
it
were
it
ready
before
me
i
do
not
feel
well
as
you
say
you
ought
to
have
taken
this
yourself
papa
it
was
made
for
jane
could
not
help
laying
a
stress
upon
the
word
tait
placed
his
hand
gently
upon
her
smoothly
parted
hair
jane
child
had
i
thought
of
myself
before
others
throughout
life
how
should
i
have
been
following
my
master
precepts
she
ran
down
the
stairs
before
him
opening
the
front
door
for
him
to
pass
through
that
even
that
little
exertion
should
be
spared
him
a
loving
dutiful
daughter
was
jane
and
it
is
probable
that
the
thought
of
her
worth
especially
crossed
the
mind
of
the
rector
at
that
moment
god
bless
you
my
child
he
aspirated
as
he
passed
her
jane
watched
him
across
the
square
their
house
though
not
actually
in
the
square
commanded
a
view
of
it
then
she
returned
upstairs
to
her
mother
papa
thinks
he
will
not
lose
time
she
observed
he
is
walking
fast
i
should
call
it
running
responded
tait
who
had
seen
the
speed
from
the
window
but
my
dear
he
do
no
good
with
that
badly
conducted
charity
booth
about
an
hour
passed
away
and
it
was
drawing
towards
jane
and
tait
were
busy
as
ever
when
halliburton
knock
was
heard
edgar
is
home
early
this
morning
jane
exclaimed
he
came
springing
up
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
in
great
haste
opened
the
door
and
just
put
in
his
head
tait
sitting
with
her
back
to
the
door
and
her
face
to
the
window
did
not
turn
round
and
consequently
did
not
see
him
jane
did
and
was
startled
every
vestige
of
colour
had
forsaken
his
face
oh
edgar
you
are
ill
ill
not
i
affecting
to
speak
gaily
i
want
you
for
a
minute
jane
tait
had
looked
round
at
jane
exclamation
but
face
was
then
withdrawn
he
was
standing
outside
the
door
when
jane
went
out
he
did
not
speak
but
took
her
hand
in
silence
and
drew
her
into
the
back
room
which
was
their
own
bedroom
and
closed
the
door
jane
face
had
grown
as
white
as
his
my
darling
i
did
not
mean
to
alarm
you
he
said
holding
her
to
him
i
thought
you
had
a
brave
heart
jane
i
thought
that
if
i
had
a
little
unpleasant
news
to
impart
it
would
be
best
to
tell
that
you
may
help
me
break
it
to
the
rest
jane
heart
was
not
feeling
very
brave
what
is
it
she
asked
scarcely
able
to
speak
the
words
from
her
ghastly
lips
jane
he
said
tenderly
and
gravely
before
i
say
any
more
you
must
strive
for
calmness
it
is
not
about
yourself
you
are
not
ill
the
question
seemed
superfluous
halliburton
was
evidently
not
ill
but
he
was
agitated
jane
was
frightened
and
perplexed
not
a
glimpse
of
the
real
truth
crossed
her
tell
me
what
it
is
at
once
edgar
she
said
in
a
calmer
tone
i
can
bear
certainty
better
than
suspense
why
yes
i
think
you
are
becoming
brave
already
he
answered
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
and
smiling
which
was
intended
to
reassure
her
i
must
have
my
wife
show
herself
a
woman
not
a
child
see
what
a
bungler
i
am
i
thought
to
tell
you
all
quietly
and
smoothly
without
alarming
you
and
see
what
i
have
done
startled
you
to
terror
jane
smiled
faintly
she
knew
all
this
was
only
the
precursor
of
tidings
that
must
be
very
ill
and
grievous
by
a
great
effort
she
schooled
herself
to
calmness
halliburton
continued
one
whom
you
and
i
love
very
much
has
has
met
with
an
accident
jane
her
fears
went
straight
to
the
right
quarter
at
once
with
that
one
exception
by
her
side
there
was
no
one
she
loved
as
she
loved
her
father
papa
yes
we
must
break
it
to
mrs
tait
her
heart
beat
wildly
against
his
hand
and
the
livid
hue
was
once
more
overspreading
her
face
but
she
strove
urgently
for
calmness
he
whispered
to
her
of
its
necessity
for
her
own
sake
edgar
is
it
death
it
was
death
but
he
would
not
tell
her
so
yet
he
plunged
into
the
attendant
details
he
was
hastening
along
with
a
small
bottle
in
his
hand
jane
it
contained
something
good
for
one
of
the
sick
poor
i
am
sure
for
he
was
in
their
neighbourhood
suddenly
he
was
observed
to
fall
and
the
spectators
raised
him
and
took
him
to
a
doctor
that
doctor
unfortunately
was
not
at
home
and
they
took
him
to
another
so
that
time
was
lost
he
was
quite
unconscious
but
you
do
not
tell
me
she
wailed
is
he
dead
halliburton
asked
himself
a
question
what
good
would
be
done
by
delaying
the
truth
he
thought
he
had
performed
his
task
very
badly
jane
jane
he
whispered
i
can
only
hope
to
help
you
to
bear
it
better
than
i
have
broken
it
to
you
she
could
not
shed
tears
in
that
first
awful
moment
physically
and
mentally
she
leaned
on
him
for
support
can
we
tell
my
mother
it
was
necessary
that
tait
should
be
told
and
without
delay
even
then
the
body
was
being
conveyed
to
the
house
by
a
curious
coincidence
halliburton
had
been
passing
the
last
doctor
surgery
at
the
very
moment
the
crowd
was
round
its
doors
unusual
business
had
called
him
there
or
it
was
a
street
he
did
not
enter
once
in
a
year
the
parson
has
fallen
down
in
a
fit
said
some
of
them
recognizing
and
arresting
him
the
parson
he
repeated
what
mr
tait
sure
enough
said
they
and
halliburton
pressed
into
the
house
just
as
the
examination
was
over
the
heart
no
doubt
sir
said
the
doctor
to
him
he
surely
is
not
dead
quite
dead
he
must
have
died
instantaneously
the
news
had
been
wafted
to
the
mob
outside
and
they
were
already
taking
a
shutter
from
its
hinges
i
will
go
on
first
and
prepare
the
family
said
halliburton
to
them
give
me
a
quarter
of
an
start
and
then
come
on
so
that
he
had
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
it
all
his
thoughts
naturally
turned
to
his
wife
not
simply
to
spare
her
alarm
and
pain
so
far
as
he
might
but
he
believed
her
young
as
she
was
to
possess
more
calmness
and
than
tait
as
he
sped
to
the
house
he
rehearsed
his
task
and
might
have
accomplished
it
better
but
for
his
face
jane
he
whispered
let
this
be
your
consolation
ever
he
was
ready
to
go
oh
yes
she
answered
bursting
into
a
storm
of
most
distressing
tears
if
any
one
here
was
ever
fit
for
heaven
it
was
my
dear
father
hark
exclaimed
halliburton
some
noise
had
arisen
downstairs
a
sound
of
voices
speaking
in
undertones
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
people
had
come
to
the
house
with
the
news
and
were
imparting
it
to
the
two
trembling
servants
there
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
jane
how
jane
dried
her
eyes
and
suppressed
all
temporary
sign
of
grief
and
emotion
she
could
not
tell
a
sense
of
duty
was
strong
within
her
and
she
knew
that
the
most
imperative
duty
of
the
present
moment
was
the
support
and
solace
of
her
mother
she
and
her
husband
entered
the
together
and
tait
turned
with
a
smile
to
halliburton
what
secrets
have
you
and
jane
been
talking
together
then
catching
sight
of
jane
white
and
quivering
lips
she
broke
into
a
cry
of
agony
jane
what
has
happened
what
have
you
both
come
to
tell
me
the
tears
poured
from
jane
fair
young
face
as
she
clasped
her
mother
fondly
to
her
tenderly
whispering
dearest
mamma
you
must
lean
upon
us
now
we
will
all
love
you
and
take
care
of
you
as
we
have
never
yet
done
chapter
iv
new
plans
the
examination
established
beyond
doubt
the
fact
that
the
rev
francis
tait
death
was
caused
by
heart
disease
in
the
earlier
period
of
his
life
it
had
been
suspected
that
he
was
subject
to
it
but
of
late
years
unfavourable
symptoms
had
not
shown
themselves
with
him
died
of
course
almost
all
his
means
and
his
family
if
not
left
utterly
destitute
had
little
to
boast
in
the
way
of
wealth
tait
enjoyed
and
had
for
some
time
enjoyed
an
annuity
of
fifty
pounds
a
year
but
it
would
cease
at
her
death
whenever
that
event
should
take
place
what
was
she
to
do
with
her
children
many
a
bereaved
widow
far
worse
off
than
tait
has
to
ask
the
same
perplexing
question
every
day
tait
children
were
partially
off
her
hands
jane
had
her
husband
francis
was
earning
his
own
living
as
an
in
a
school
with
margaret
ten
pounds
a
year
must
be
paid
and
there
was
still
robert
the
death
had
occurred
in
july
by
october
they
must
be
away
from
the
house
you
will
be
at
no
loss
for
a
home
tait
halliburton
took
an
opportunity
of
kindly
saying
to
her
you
must
allow
me
and
jane
to
welcome
you
to
ours
yes
edgar
was
tait
unhesitating
reply
it
will
be
the
best
plan
the
furniture
in
this
house
will
do
for
yours
and
you
shall
have
it
and
you
must
take
me
and
my
small
means
into
it
an
incumbrance
to
you
i
have
pondered
it
all
over
and
i
do
not
see
anything
else
that
can
be
done
i
have
no
right
whatever
to
your
furniture
he
replied
and
jane
has
no
more
right
to
it
than
have
your
other
children
the
furniture
shall
be
put
into
my
house
if
you
please
but
you
must
either
allow
me
to
pay
you
for
it
or
it
shall
remain
your
own
to
be
removed
again
at
any
time
you
may
please
a
house
was
looked
for
and
taken
the
furniture
was
valued
and
halliburton
bought
it
a
fourth
part
of
the
sum
tait
positively
refusing
to
take
for
she
declared
that
so
much
belonged
to
jane
then
they
quitted
the
old
house
of
many
years
and
moved
into
the
new
one
and
halliburton
tait
robert
and
the
two
servants
will
it
be
prudent
for
you
my
dear
to
retain
both
the
servants
tait
asked
of
her
daughter
jane
blushed
vividly
we
could
do
with
one
at
present
mamma
but
the
time
will
be
coming
that
i
shall
require
two
and
susan
and
mary
are
both
so
good
that
i
do
not
care
to
part
with
them
you
are
used
to
them
too
ah
child
i
know
that
in
all
your
plans
and
schemes
you
and
edgar
think
first
of
my
comfort
do
you
know
what
i
was
thinking
of
last
night
as
i
lay
in
bed
what
mamma
when
halliburton
first
spoke
of
wanting
you
i
and
your
poor
papa
felt
inclined
to
hesitate
thinking
you
might
have
made
a
better
match
but
my
dear
i
was
wondering
last
night
what
we
should
have
done
in
this
crisis
but
for
him
yes
said
jane
gently
things
that
appear
untoward
at
the
time
frequently
turn
out
afterwards
to
have
been
the
very
best
that
could
have
happened
god
directs
all
things
you
know
mamma
a
contention
arose
respecting
robert
some
weeks
after
they
had
been
in
their
new
house
or
it
may
be
better
to
call
it
a
discussion
robert
had
never
taken
very
kindly
to
what
he
called
tait
wish
had
been
that
both
his
sons
should
enter
the
church
robert
had
never
openly
opposed
this
wish
and
for
the
calling
itself
he
had
a
liking
but
particularly
disliked
the
study
and
application
necessary
to
fit
him
for
it
silent
while
his
father
lived
he
was
so
no
longer
but
took
every
opportunity
of
urging
the
point
upon
his
mother
he
was
still
attending
percy
school
daily
you
know
mother
dropping
down
one
day
in
a
chair
close
to
his
mother
and
jane
and
catching
up
one
leg
to
nurse
rather
a
favourite
action
of
his
i
shall
never
earn
salt
at
it
salt
at
what
robert
asked
tait
why
at
these
rubbishing
classics
shall
never
make
a
tutor
as
halliburton
and
francis
do
and
what
on
earth
to
become
of
me
as
to
any
chance
of
my
being
a
parson
of
course
that
over
where
the
money
to
come
from
what
to
become
of
you
then
cried
tait
i
sure
i
know
besides
went
on
robert
lowering
his
voice
and
calling
up
the
most
effectual
argument
he
could
think
of
i
ought
to
be
doing
something
for
myself
i
am
living
here
upon
mr
halliburton
he
is
delighted
to
have
you
robert
interrupted
jane
quickly
mamma
pays
be
quiet
jane
what
sort
of
a
wife
do
you
call
yourself
pray
to
go
against
your
husband
interests
in
that
manner
i
heard
you
preaching
up
to
the
charity
children
the
other
day
about
its
being
sinful
to
waste
time
well
said
jane
well
what
waste
of
time
for
other
people
is
not
waste
of
time
for
me
i
suppose
went
on
robert
you
are
not
wasting
your
time
robert
i
am
and
if
you
had
the
sense
people
give
you
credit
for
madam
jane
you
see
it
i
shall
never
i
say
earn
my
salt
at
teaching
and
just
tell
me
yourself
whether
there
seems
any
chance
now
that
i
shall
enter
the
church
at
present
i
do
not
see
that
there
is
confessed
jane
there
then
is
it
waste
of
time
or
not
my
continuing
to
study
for
a
career
which
i
can
never
enter
upon
but
what
else
can
you
do
robert
interposed
tait
you
can
not
idle
your
time
away
at
home
or
be
running
about
the
streets
all
day
no
said
robert
better
stop
at
school
for
ever
than
do
that
i
want
to
see
the
world
mother
you
want
to
see
the
world
echoed
tait
bringing
out
the
words
slowly
in
her
astonishment
whilst
jane
looked
up
from
her
work
and
fixed
her
eyes
upon
her
brother
it
only
natural
that
i
should
said
robert
with
equanimity
i
have
an
invitation
to
go
down
into
yorkshire
what
to
do
cried
tait
oh
lots
of
things
they
keep
hunters
and
why
you
were
never
on
horseback
in
your
life
robert
laughed
jane
you
would
come
back
with
your
neck
broken
i
do
wish
you
be
quiet
jane
returned
robert
reddening
i
am
talking
to
mamma
not
to
you
winchcombe
has
invited
me
to
spend
the
christmas
holidays
with
him
down
at
his
father
place
in
yorkshire
and
mother
i
want
to
go
and
i
want
you
to
promise
that
i
shall
not
return
to
school
when
the
holidays
are
over
i
will
do
anything
else
that
you
choose
to
put
me
to
i
learn
to
be
a
man
of
business
or
i
go
into
an
office
or
i
be
apprenticed
to
a
doctor
anything
you
like
rather
than
stop
at
these
everlasting
i
am
of
them
robert
you
take
my
breath
away
uttered
tait
i
have
no
interest
anywhere
i
could
not
get
you
into
any
of
these
places
i
dare
say
halliburton
could
he
knows
lots
of
people
jane
you
talk
to
him
he
do
anything
for
you
there
ensued
i
say
much
discussion
about
robert
but
it
is
not
with
robert
tait
that
our
story
has
to
do
and
only
a
few
words
need
be
given
to
him
here
and
there
it
appeared
to
them
all
that
it
would
be
inexpedient
for
him
to
continue
at
school
both
with
regard
to
his
own
wishes
and
to
his
prospects
he
was
allowed
to
pay
the
visit
with
his
schoolfellow
and
as
he
came
back
with
neck
unbroken
halliburton
succeeded
in
placing
him
in
a
large
wholesale
warehouse
robert
appeared
to
like
it
very
much
at
first
and
always
came
home
to
spend
sunday
with
them
he
may
rise
in
time
to
be
one
of
the
first
mercantile
men
in
london
observed
halliburton
to
his
wife
one
of
our
as
my
uncle
used
to
say
by
me
if
only
if
what
why
do
you
hesitate
she
asked
if
he
will
only
persevere
i
was
going
to
say
but
jane
i
fear
perseverance
is
a
quality
that
robert
does
not
possess
of
course
all
that
had
to
be
proved
it
lay
in
the
future
chapter
margaret
from
two
to
three
years
passed
away
and
the
midsummer
holidays
were
approaching
margaret
was
expected
as
usual
for
them
and
jane
delighted
to
receive
her
went
about
her
glad
preparations
margaret
would
not
return
to
the
school
in
which
she
had
been
a
paid
teacher
for
the
last
year
but
was
to
enter
a
family
as
governess
for
one
efficient
accomplished
governess
to
be
met
with
in
those
days
scores
may
be
counted
now
or
who
profess
to
be
so
and
margaret
tait
though
barely
nineteen
anticipated
a
salary
of
seventy
or
eighty
guineas
a
year
a
warm
bright
day
in
june
that
on
which
halliburton
went
to
receive
margaret
the
coach
brought
her
to
its
the
bull
and
mouth
in
and
halliburton
reached
the
inn
as
paul
clock
was
striking
midday
one
minute
more
and
the
coach
drove
in
there
she
was
inside
a
tall
fine
girl
with
a
handsome
face
a
face
full
of
resolution
and
energy
margaret
tait
had
her
good
qualities
and
she
had
also
her
faults
a
great
one
speaking
of
the
latter
was
she
opened
the
door
herself
and
leaped
out
before
any
one
could
help
her
all
joy
and
delight
and
what
about
your
boxes
margaret
questioned
halliburton
after
a
few
words
of
greeting
have
they
come
this
time
or
not
margaret
laughed
yes
they
really
have
i
have
not
lost
them
on
the
road
as
i
did
at
christmas
you
will
never
forget
to
tell
me
of
that
i
am
sure
but
it
was
more
the
guard
fault
than
mine
a
few
minutes
and
halliburton
margaret
and
the
boxes
were
lumbering
along
in
one
of
the
old
glass
coaches
and
now
tell
me
about
every
one
said
margaret
how
is
dear
mamma
she
is
quite
well
we
are
all
well
jane
famous
and
my
precious
little
willy
oh
said
halliburton
quaintly
he
is
a
great
deal
too
troublesome
for
anything
to
be
the
matter
with
him
i
tell
jane
she
will
have
to
begin
the
whipping
system
soon
and
much
jane
will
attend
to
you
is
it
a
pretty
baby
halliburton
raised
his
eyebrows
jane
thinks
so
i
wonder
she
has
not
had
its
likeness
taken
is
it
christened
continued
margaret
it
is
baptized
jane
would
not
have
the
christening
until
you
were
at
home
and
its
name
jane
what
a
shame
jane
promised
me
it
should
be
margaret
why
did
she
decide
upon
her
own
name
i
decided
upon
it
said
halliburton
yours
can
wait
until
the
next
margaret
margaret
laughed
and
how
are
you
getting
on
very
well
i
have
every
hour
of
the
day
occupied
i
do
think
you
are
looking
well
rejoined
margaret
you
look
thin
and
fagged
i
am
always
thin
and
mine
is
a
fagging
profession
sometimes
i
feel
terribly
weary
but
i
am
pretty
well
upon
the
whole
margaret
will
francis
be
at
home
these
holidays
no
he
passes
them
at
a
gentleman
house
in
norfolk
tutor
to
his
sons
francis
is
thoroughly
industrious
and
persevering
a
contrast
to
poor
robert
i
suppose
well
yes
in
that
sense
there
has
been
some
trouble
about
robert
has
there
not
asked
margaret
her
tone
becoming
grave
did
he
not
get
discharged
he
received
notice
of
discharge
but
i
saw
the
principals
and
begged
him
on
again
i
would
not
talk
about
it
to
him
if
i
were
you
margaret
he
is
sensitive
upon
the
point
robert
intentions
are
good
but
his
disposition
is
fickle
he
has
grown
tired
of
his
work
and
idles
his
time
away
no
house
of
business
will
put
up
with
that
the
coach
arrived
at
halliburton
margaret
rushed
out
of
it
giving
no
one
time
to
assist
her
as
she
had
done
out
of
the
other
coach
at
the
bull
and
mouth
there
was
a
great
deal
of
impetuosity
in
margaret
tait
character
she
was
quite
a
contrast
to
jane
as
she
had
just
remarked
there
was
a
contrast
between
francis
and
robert
upon
other
points
to
sensible
jane
who
came
forward
so
calmly
to
greet
her
a
glad
depth
of
affection
in
her
quiet
eyes
a
boisterous
embrace
to
her
mother
a
boisterous
embrace
to
jane
all
in
haste
and
then
margaret
caught
up
a
little
gentleman
of
some
two
years
old
or
more
who
was
standing
holding
on
to
jane
dress
his
great
grey
eyes
honest
loving
intelligent
as
were
his
mother
cast
up
in
a
broad
stare
at
margaret
you
naughty
willy
have
you
forgotten
aunt
margaret
oh
you
darling
child
who
this
she
carried
the
boy
up
to
the
end
of
the
room
where
stood
their
old
servant
mary
nursing
an
infant
of
two
months
old
the
baby
had
great
grey
eyes
also
and
they
likewise
were
bent
on
noisy
margaret
oh
willy
she
is
prettier
than
you
i
wo
nurse
you
any
more
mary
shake
hands
with
you
presently
i
must
take
that
enchanting
baby
first
dropping
discarded
willy
upon
the
ground
snatching
the
baby
from
arms
margaret
kissed
its
pretty
face
until
she
made
it
cry
jane
came
to
the
rescue
you
do
understand
babies
margaret
let
mary
take
her
again
come
upstairs
to
your
room
and
make
yourself
ready
for
dinner
i
think
you
must
be
hungry
so
hungry
that
i
shall
frighten
you
of
course
with
the
thought
of
coming
home
i
could
not
touch
breakfast
i
hope
you
have
something
especially
nice
your
favourite
dinner
said
jane
smiling
loin
of
veal
and
broccoli
how
thoughtful
you
are
jane
margaret
could
not
help
exclaiming
margaret
my
dear
called
out
her
mother
as
she
was
leaving
the
room
with
jane
margaret
looked
back
what
mamma
i
hope
you
will
not
continue
to
go
on
with
these
children
as
you
have
begun
otherwise
we
shall
have
a
quiet
house
turned
into
a
noisy
one
is
it
a
quiet
house
said
margaret
laughing
as
if
any
house
would
not
be
quiet
regulated
by
jane
replied
tait
and
margaret
laughing
still
followed
her
sister
it
is
curious
to
remark
how
differently
things
sometimes
turn
out
from
what
we
intended
had
any
one
asked
tait
the
day
that
margaret
came
home
what
margaret
future
career
was
to
be
she
had
wondered
at
the
question
a
governess
certainly
would
have
been
her
answer
and
she
would
have
thought
that
no
power
humanly
speaking
could
prevent
it
and
yet
margaret
tait
as
it
proved
never
did
become
a
governess
the
holidays
were
drawing
to
an
end
and
a
very
desirable
situation
as
was
believed
had
been
found
for
margaret
by
halliburton
the
negotiations
for
which
were
nearly
completed
halliburton
gave
private
lessons
in
sundry
families
and
thus
enabled
to
hear
where
ladies
were
required
as
governesses
he
had
recommended
margaret
the
recommendation
was
favourably
received
and
a
day
was
appointed
for
margaret
to
make
a
personal
visit
at
the
town
house
of
the
people
in
question
when
she
would
most
probably
be
engaged
on
the
previous
evening
at
twilight
halliburton
came
home
from
one
of
his
numerous
engagements
jane
was
alone
tait
not
very
well
had
retired
to
rest
early
and
margaret
was
out
with
robert
in
this
a
leisure
season
of
the
year
robert
had
most
of
his
evenings
to
himself
after
eight
he
generally
came
home
and
he
and
margaret
would
go
out
together
halliburton
sat
down
at
one
of
the
windows
in
silence
jane
went
up
to
him
laying
her
hand
affectionately
on
his
shoulder
you
are
very
tired
edgar
he
did
not
reply
only
drew
her
hand
between
his
and
kept
it
there
you
shall
have
supper
at
once
said
jane
glancing
at
the
tray
which
stood
ready
on
the
table
i
am
sure
you
must
want
it
and
it
is
not
right
to
indulge
margaret
every
night
by
waiting
for
her
scarcely
when
she
does
not
come
in
until
ten
or
said
halliburton
jane
he
added
confidentially
do
you
think
it
well
that
margaret
should
be
out
so
frequently
in
an
evening
she
is
with
robert
she
may
not
always
be
with
robert
alone
jane
felt
her
face
flush
she
knew
her
husband
knew
that
he
was
not
one
to
speak
unless
he
had
some
reason
for
doing
so
edgar
why
do
you
say
this
do
you
know
anything
have
you
seen
margaret
i
saw
her
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
with
robert
interrupted
jane
more
impulsively
than
she
was
in
the
habit
of
speaking
robert
was
by
her
side
but
she
was
walking
arm
in
arm
with
mr
murray
jane
did
not
much
like
the
information
this
murray
was
in
the
same
house
as
robert
holding
a
better
position
robert
had
occasionally
brought
him
home
and
he
had
taken
tea
with
them
halliburton
felt
surprised
at
margaret
it
appeared
to
her
mind
very
like
a
clandestine
proceeding
what
would
she
have
said
or
thought
had
she
known
that
margaret
and
murray
were
in
the
habit
of
thus
walking
together
constantly
robert
being
with
them
afforded
no
sufficient
excuse
later
they
saw
margaret
coming
home
with
robert
alone
he
left
her
at
the
door
as
usual
and
then
hastened
away
to
his
own
home
jane
said
nothing
then
but
she
went
to
margaret
room
that
evening
oh
edgar
has
been
bringing
home
tales
has
he
was
margaret
answer
when
the
ice
was
broken
and
her
defiant
tone
brought
jane
hardly
knew
what
of
dismay
to
her
ear
i
saw
him
staring
at
us
margaret
gasped
jane
what
can
have
come
to
you
you
are
completely
changed
you
you
seem
to
speak
no
longer
as
a
lady
then
why
do
you
provoke
me
jane
is
it
high
treason
to
take
a
gentleman
arm
my
brother
being
with
me
it
is
not
right
to
do
it
in
secret
margaret
if
you
go
out
ostensibly
to
walk
with
robert
jane
i
will
not
listen
margaret
said
with
flashing
eyes
because
you
are
halliburton
you
assume
a
right
to
lecture
me
i
have
committed
no
grievous
wrong
when
i
do
commit
it
you
may
take
your
turn
then
oh
margaret
why
will
you
misjudge
me
asked
jane
her
voice
full
of
pain
i
speak
to
you
in
love
not
in
anger
i
would
not
speak
at
all
but
for
your
good
if
the
chevasneys
were
to
hear
of
this
they
might
think
you
an
unsuitable
mistress
for
their
children
compose
yourself
said
margaret
scoffingly
never
had
she
shown
such
a
temper
so
undesirable
a
disposition
as
on
this
night
and
jane
might
well
look
at
her
in
amazement
and
hint
that
she
was
changed
i
shall
be
found
sufficiently
suitable
by
the
chevasney
family
when
i
consent
to
enter
it
her
tone
was
strangely
significant
and
jane
halliburton
heart
beat
what
do
you
imply
margaret
she
inquired
you
appear
to
have
some
peculiar
meaning
margaret
who
had
been
standing
before
the
glass
all
this
time
twisting
her
hair
round
her
fingers
turned
and
looked
her
sister
full
in
the
face
jane
i
tell
you
if
you
will
undertake
to
make
things
straight
for
me
with
mamma
i
am
not
going
to
the
chevasneys
or
anywhere
else
as
governess
yes
said
jane
faintly
for
she
had
a
presentiment
of
what
was
coming
i
am
going
to
be
married
instead
oh
margaret
there
is
nothing
to
groan
about
retorted
margaret
murray
is
coming
to
speak
to
mamma
and
if
any
of
you
have
anything
to
say
against
him
you
can
say
it
to
his
face
he
is
a
very
respectable
man
and
has
a
good
income
where
the
objection
to
him
jane
could
not
say
personally
she
did
not
very
much
like
murray
and
certain
fond
visions
had
pictured
a
higher
destiny
for
handsome
accomplished
margaret
i
hope
and
trust
you
will
be
happy
if
you
do
marry
him
margaret
was
all
she
said
i
hope
i
shall
i
must
take
my
chance
of
that
as
others
do
jane
i
beg
your
pardon
for
my
crossness
but
you
put
me
out
of
temper
as
others
do
ay
it
was
all
a
lottery
and
margaret
tait
entered
upon
her
married
life
knowing
that
it
was
so
chapter
vi
in
several
years
went
on
and
years
rarely
go
on
without
bringing
changes
with
them
jane
had
now
four
children
william
the
eldest
was
close
upon
thirteen
edgar
the
youngest
going
on
for
nine
jane
and
frank
were
between
them
tait
was
dead
and
francis
tait
was
the
reverend
francis
tait
by
dint
of
hard
work
and
perseverance
he
had
succeeded
in
qualifying
for
orders
and
was
half
starving
upon
a
london
curacy
as
his
father
had
done
for
so
many
years
before
him
in
saying
half
starving
i
do
mean
that
he
had
not
bread
and
cheese
to
eat
but
when
a
clergyman
stipend
is
under
a
hundred
a
year
the
expression
half
starving
is
justifiable
he
hungers
after
many
things
that
he
is
unable
to
obtain
and
he
can
not
maintain
his
position
as
a
gentleman
francis
tait
hungered
over
one
want
especially
he
hungered
with
an
intensely
ravenous
hunger
and
that
was
the
gratification
of
his
taste
for
literature
the
books
he
coveted
to
read
were
expensive
impossibilities
to
him
he
could
not
purchase
them
and
libraries
were
then
scarce
had
francis
tait
not
been
gifted
with
very
great
conscientiousness
he
would
have
joined
teaching
with
his
ministry
but
the
wants
of
his
parish
required
all
his
time
and
he
had
inherited
that
large
share
of
the
monitor
conscience
from
his
father
i
suppose
i
shall
have
a
living
some
time
he
would
think
to
himself
when
i
am
growing
an
old
man
probably
as
he
was
when
he
gained
his
so
the
reverend
francis
tait
plodded
on
at
his
curacy
and
was
content
to
await
that
remote
day
when
fortune
should
drop
from
the
skies
where
was
margaret
margaret
had
bidden
adieu
to
old
england
for
ever
her
husband
who
had
not
been
promoted
in
his
house
of
business
as
rapidly
as
he
thought
he
ought
to
have
been
had
thrown
up
his
situation
home
and
home
ties
and
gone
out
to
the
woods
of
canada
to
become
a
settler
did
margaret
repent
her
hasty
marriage
then
did
she
find
that
her
finished
education
her
peculiar
tastes
and
habits
so
unfitted
for
domestic
life
were
all
lost
in
those
wild
woods
music
drawing
languages
literature
of
what
use
were
to
her
now
she
might
educate
her
own
children
indeed
as
they
grew
up
the
only
chance
of
education
it
appeared
likely
they
would
have
that
margaret
found
herself
in
a
peculiarly
uncongenial
atmosphere
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
like
a
brave
woman
as
she
proved
herself
not
a
hint
of
it
in
writing
home
ever
escaped
her
not
a
shadow
of
complaint
could
be
gathered
there
it
was
not
often
that
she
wrote
and
her
letters
grew
more
rare
as
the
years
went
on
robert
had
accompanied
them
and
he
boasted
that
he
liked
the
life
much
a
thousand
times
better
than
that
of
the
musty
old
warehouse
halliburton
teaching
was
excellent
his
income
good
he
was
now
one
of
the
professors
at
king
college
but
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
carrying
out
his
dream
that
of
getting
to
oxford
or
cambridge
edgar
halliburton
had
begun
at
the
wrong
end
of
the
ladder
he
should
have
gone
to
college
first
and
married
afterwards
he
married
first
and
to
college
he
never
went
a
man
of
moderate
means
with
a
home
to
keep
a
wife
children
servants
to
provide
for
has
enough
to
do
with
his
money
and
time
without
spending
them
at
college
he
had
quite
given
up
the
idea
now
and
perhaps
had
grown
not
to
regret
it
very
keenly
his
home
was
one
of
refinement
comfort
and
thorough
happiness
but
about
this
period
or
indeed
some
time
prior
to
it
halliburton
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
was
overtaxing
his
strength
for
a
long
long
while
almost
ever
since
he
had
been
in
london
he
was
aware
that
he
had
not
felt
thoroughly
well
hot
weather
affected
him
and
rendered
him
languid
the
chills
of
winter
gave
him
a
cough
the
keen
winds
of
spring
attacked
his
chest
he
would
throw
off
his
ailments
bravely
and
go
on
again
not
heeding
them
or
thinking
that
they
might
ever
become
serious
perhaps
he
never
gave
a
thought
to
that
until
one
evening
when
upon
coming
in
after
a
hard
day
toil
he
sat
down
in
his
chair
and
quietly
fainted
away
jane
and
one
of
the
servants
were
standing
over
him
when
he
recovered
jane
face
very
pale
and
anxious
do
not
be
alarmed
he
said
smiling
at
her
i
suppose
i
dropped
asleep
or
lost
consciousness
in
some
way
you
fainted
edgar
fainted
did
i
how
silly
i
must
have
been
the
room
warm
jane
it
must
have
overpowered
me
jane
was
not
deceived
she
saw
that
he
was
making
light
of
it
to
quiet
her
alarm
and
brought
him
a
glass
of
wine
he
drank
it
but
could
not
eat
anything
frequently
could
not
eat
now
edgar
she
said
you
are
doing
too
much
i
have
seen
it
for
a
long
time
past
seen
what
jane
that
your
strength
is
not
equal
to
your
work
you
must
give
up
a
portion
of
your
teaching
my
dear
how
can
i
do
so
does
it
not
take
all
i
earn
to
meet
expenses
when
accounts
are
settled
at
the
end
of
the
year
have
we
a
shilling
to
spare
it
was
so
and
jane
knew
it
but
her
husband
health
was
above
every
consideration
in
the
world
we
must
reduce
our
expenses
she
said
we
must
cease
to
live
as
we
are
living
now
we
will
move
into
a
smaller
house
and
keep
one
servant
and
i
will
turn
she
laughed
quite
merrily
but
halliburton
detected
a
serious
meaning
in
her
tone
he
shook
his
head
no
jane
that
time
i
hope
will
never
come
he
lay
awake
all
that
night
buried
in
reflection
do
you
know
what
this
is
when
it
comes
to
us
in
all
its
racking
intensity
surging
over
his
brain
like
the
wild
waves
that
chase
each
other
on
the
ocean
came
the
thought
what
will
become
of
my
wife
and
children
if
i
die
thought
after
thought
they
all
resolved
themselves
into
that
one
focus
i
have
made
no
provision
for
my
wife
and
children
what
will
become
of
them
if
i
am
taken
halliburton
had
one
good
habit
it
was
possible
that
he
had
learnt
it
from
his
wife
for
it
was
hers
in
no
ordinary
degree
the
habit
of
steadfastly
into
the
face
of
not
to
groan
and
grumble
at
it
to
sigh
and
lament
that
no
one
else
trouble
ever
was
so
great
before
but
to
see
how
it
might
best
be
met
and
contended
with
how
the
best
could
be
made
of
it
the
only
feasible
way
he
could
see
was
that
of
insuring
his
life
he
possessed
neither
lands
nor
money
did
he
attempt
to
put
by
a
portion
of
his
income
it
would
take
years
and
years
to
accumulate
into
a
sum
worth
mentioning
why
how
long
would
it
take
him
to
economise
only
a
thousand
pounds
no
there
was
only
one
way
that
of
life
insurance
it
was
an
idea
that
would
have
occurred
to
most
of
us
he
did
not
know
how
much
it
would
take
from
his
yearly
income
to
effect
it
a
great
deal
he
was
afraid
for
he
was
approaching
what
is
called
middle
life
he
had
no
secrets
from
his
wife
he
consulted
her
upon
every
point
she
was
his
best
friend
his
confidante
his
gentle
counsellor
and
he
had
no
intention
of
concealing
the
step
he
was
about
to
take
why
should
he
jane
he
began
when
they
were
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
do
you
know
what
i
have
been
thinking
of
all
night
trouble
i
am
sure
she
answered
you
have
been
very
restless
not
exactly
trouble
for
he
did
not
choose
to
acknowledge
even
to
himself
that
a
strange
sense
of
trouble
did
seem
to
rest
on
his
heart
and
to
weigh
it
down
i
have
been
thinking
more
of
precaution
than
trouble
precaution
echoed
jane
looking
at
him
ay
love
and
the
astonishing
part
of
the
business
to
myself
is
that
i
never
thought
of
the
necessity
for
this
precaution
before
jane
divined
now
what
he
meant
often
and
often
had
the
idea
occurred
to
her
should
my
husband
health
or
life
fail
we
are
destitute
not
for
herself
did
she
so
much
care
but
for
her
children
that
sudden
attack
last
night
has
brought
me
reflection
he
resumed
life
is
uncertain
with
the
best
of
us
it
may
be
no
more
uncertain
with
me
than
with
others
but
i
feel
that
i
must
act
as
though
it
were
so
jane
were
i
taken
there
would
be
no
provision
for
you
no
she
quietly
said
and
therefore
i
must
set
about
making
one
without
delay
as
far
as
i
can
i
shall
insure
my
life
jane
did
not
answer
immediately
it
will
take
a
great
deal
of
money
edgar
she
presently
said
i
fear
it
will
but
it
must
be
done
what
the
matter
jane
you
look
hopeful
over
it
because
were
you
to
insure
your
life
to
pay
the
yearly
premium
and
our
home
expenses
would
necessitate
your
working
as
hard
as
you
do
now
well
said
he
of
course
it
would
in
any
case
our
expenses
shall
be
much
reduced
of
that
i
am
determined
she
went
on
somewhat
dreamily
more
it
seemed
in
soliloquy
than
to
her
husband
but
with
this
premium
to
pay
in
addition
jane
he
interrupted
there
not
the
least
necessity
for
my
relaxing
my
labours
i
shall
not
think
of
doing
it
i
may
not
be
very
strong
but
i
am
not
as
to
reducing
our
expenses
i
see
no
help
for
that
inasmuch
as
i
must
draw
from
them
for
the
premium
if
you
only
can
keep
your
health
edgar
it
is
certainly
what
ought
to
be
done
to
insure
your
life
the
thought
has
often
crossed
me
why
did
you
never
suggest
it
i
scarcely
know
i
believe
i
did
not
like
to
do
so
and
i
really
did
not
see
how
the
premium
was
to
be
paid
how
much
shall
you
insure
it
for
i
thought
of
two
thousand
pounds
could
we
afford
more
i
think
not
what
would
be
the
yearly
premium
for
that
sum
i
do
know
i
will
ascertain
all
particulars
what
are
you
sighing
about
jane
jane
was
sighing
heavily
a
weight
seemed
to
have
fallen
upon
her
to
talk
of
puts
me
too
much
in
mind
of
death
she
murmured
now
jane
you
are
never
going
to
turn
goose
he
gaily
said
i
have
heard
of
persons
who
will
not
make
a
will
because
it
brings
them
a
fancy
they
must
be
going
to
die
insuring
my
life
will
not
bring
death
any
the
quicker
to
me
i
hope
i
shall
be
here
many
a
year
yet
why
jane
i
may
live
to
pay
the
insurance
over
and
over
again
in
annual
premiums
better
that
i
had
put
by
the
money
in
a
bank
i
shall
think
then
the
worst
of
putting
by
money
in
a
bank
or
in
any
other
way
is
that
you
are
not
to
put
it
observed
jane
looking
up
a
little
from
her
depression
what
ought
to
be
put
by
what
is
intended
to
be
put
by
too
often
goes
in
present
wants
and
putting
by
ends
in
name
only
whereas
in
the
premium
be
paid
edgar
she
added
passing
to
a
different
subject
i
wonder
what
we
shall
make
of
our
boys
halliburton
cheek
flushed
shall
go
to
college
please
god
though
i
have
not
been
able
to
get
there
myself
oh
i
hope
so
one
or
two
of
them
at
any
rate
little
difficulty
did
there
appear
to
be
in
the
plan
to
halliburton
his
boys
should
enter
the
university
although
he
had
not
done
so
the
future
of
our
children
appears
hopeful
and
easy
to
most
of
us
william
and
frank
were
in
the
school
attached
to
king
college
of
which
you
hear
halliburton
was
now
a
professor
edgar
never
called
anything
but
gar
went
to
a
private
school
but
he
would
soon
be
entered
at
king
college
remarkably
boys
for
their
years
were
the
young
halliburtons
halliburton
and
jane
had
taken
care
of
that
home
teaching
was
more
efficient
than
school
both
combined
had
rendered
them
unusually
intelligent
and
advanced
naturally
intellectual
gifted
with
excellent
qualities
of
mind
and
heart
halliburton
had
not
failed
to
do
her
duty
by
them
she
spared
no
pains
she
knew
how
children
ought
to
be
brought
up
and
she
did
her
duty
well
ah
my
friends
only
lay
a
good
foundation
in
their
earlier
years
and
your
children
will
grow
up
to
bless
you
jane
i
wonder
which
office
will
be
the
best
to
insure
in
jane
began
to
recall
the
names
of
some
that
were
familiar
to
her
the
phoenix
suggested
she
halliburton
laughed
i
think
that
only
for
fire
jane
i
am
not
sure
though
in
truth
he
knew
little
about
insurance
offices
himself
there
the
sun
and
the
atlas
and
the
argus
oh
and
ever
so
many
more
continued
jane
i
inquire
all
about
it
said
he
i
wonder
if
the
premium
will
take
a
hundred
a
year
edgar
he
could
not
tell
he
feared
it
might
i
wish
jane
he
observed
that
i
had
insured
my
life
when
i
first
married
the
premium
would
have
been
small
then
and
we
might
have
managed
to
spare
it
ay
she
answered
sometimes
i
look
back
to
things
that
i
might
have
done
in
the
past
years
and
i
did
not
do
them
now
the
time
has
gone
by
well
it
has
not
gone
by
for
insuring
said
halliburton
rising
from
the
and
speaking
in
gay
tones
eight
he
cried
looking
at
his
watch
jane
said
he
bending
to
kiss
her
wish
me
luck
a
weighty
insurance
and
a
small
premium
she
said
laughing
but
you
are
not
going
about
it
now
of
course
not
the
offices
would
not
be
open
i
shall
take
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
in
the
course
of
the
day
halliburton
departed
on
his
usual
duties
it
was
a
warm
day
in
april
his
first
attendance
was
king
college
and
there
he
remained
for
the
morning
then
he
proceeded
to
gain
information
about
the
various
offices
and
their
respective
merits
finally
fixed
upon
the
one
he
should
apply
to
and
bent
his
steps
towards
it
it
was
situated
in
the
heart
of
the
city
in
a
very
busy
part
of
it
the
office
also
appeared
to
be
busy
for
several
people
were
in
it
when
halliburton
entered
a
young
man
came
forward
to
know
his
business
i
wish
to
insure
my
life
said
halliburton
how
must
i
proceed
about
it
oh
yes
sir
procter
will
you
attend
to
this
gentleman
halliburton
was
marshalled
to
an
inner
room
where
a
gentlemanly
man
received
him
he
explained
his
business
in
detail
stated
his
age
and
the
sum
he
wished
to
insure
for
every
information
was
politely
afforded
him
and
a
paper
with
certain
printed
questions
was
given
him
to
fill
up
at
his
leisure
and
then
to
be
returned
halliburton
glanced
over
it
you
require
a
certificate
of
my
birth
from
the
parish
register
where
i
was
baptized
i
perceive
he
remarked
why
so
in
stating
my
age
i
have
stated
it
correctly
the
gentleman
smiled
of
that
i
make
no
doubt
he
said
for
you
look
younger
than
the
age
you
have
given
me
our
office
makes
it
a
rule
in
most
cases
to
require
the
certificate
from
the
register
all
applicants
are
not
scrupulous
about
telling
the
truth
and
we
have
been
obliged
to
adopt
it
in
we
have
had
cases
we
have
indeed
sir
where
we
have
insured
a
life
and
then
found
though
perhaps
not
until
the
actual
death
has
taken
place
that
the
insurer
was
ten
years
older
than
he
asserted
therefore
we
demand
a
certificate
it
does
occasionally
happen
that
applicants
can
bring
men
to
testify
to
their
age
and
then
we
do
not
mind
dispensing
with
it
halliburton
sent
his
thoughts
round
in
a
circle
there
was
no
one
in
london
who
knew
his
age
of
their
own
positive
knowledge
so
it
was
useless
to
think
of
that
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
the
matter
he
said
aloud
i
can
get
the
certificate
up
from
devonshire
in
the
course
of
two
or
three
days
by
writing
for
it
my
father
was
rector
of
the
church
where
i
was
christened
this
will
be
all
then
to
fill
up
this
paper
and
bring
you
the
certificate
all
with
the
exception
of
being
examined
by
our
physician
what
is
it
necessary
to
be
examined
by
a
physician
exclaimed
halliburton
the
paper
states
that
i
must
hand
in
a
report
from
my
ordinary
medical
attendant
will
not
give
you
a
bad
report
of
me
he
added
smiling
for
it
is
little
enough
i
have
troubled
him
i
believe
the
worst
thing
he
has
attended
me
for
has
been
a
bad
cold
so
much
the
better
remarked
the
gentleman
you
do
not
look
very
strong
very
strong
i
do
think
i
am
i
am
too
hard
worked
get
too
little
rest
and
recreation
it
was
suspecting
that
i
am
not
so
strong
as
i
might
be
that
set
me
thinking
it
might
be
well
to
insure
my
life
for
the
sake
of
my
wife
and
children
he
ingenuously
added
in
his
straightforward
manner
if
i
could
count
upon
living
and
working
on
until
i
am
an
old
man
i
should
not
do
so
again
the
gentleman
smiled
looks
are
deceitful
he
observed
nothing
more
so
sometimes
those
who
look
the
most
delicate
live
the
longest
you
can
not
say
i
look
delicate
returned
halliburton
i
did
not
say
it
i
consider
that
you
do
not
look
robust
but
that
is
not
saying
that
you
look
delicate
you
may
be
a
perfectly
healthy
man
for
all
i
can
say
to
the
contrary
he
ran
his
eyes
over
halliburton
as
he
spoke
over
his
tall
fine
form
his
dark
hair
amidst
which
not
a
streak
of
grey
mingled
his
features
and
his
complexion
bright
as
a
woman
was
there
suspicion
in
that
complexion
a
handsome
man
at
any
rate
thought
the
gazer
if
not
a
robust
one
it
will
be
necessary
then
that
i
see
your
physician
asked
halliburton
yes
it
can
not
be
dispensed
with
we
would
not
insure
without
it
he
attends
here
twice
a
week
in
the
intervening
days
he
may
be
seen
in
from
three
to
five
it
is
carrington
his
days
for
coming
here
are
mondays
and
thursdays
and
this
is
friday
remarked
halliburton
i
shall
probably
go
up
to
him
halliburton
said
good
morning
and
came
away
with
his
paper
great
nonsense
my
seeing
this
doctor
he
said
to
himself
as
he
hastened
home
to
dinner
which
he
knew
he
must
have
kept
waiting
but
i
suppose
it
is
necessary
as
a
general
rule
and
of
course
they
wo
make
me
an
exception
hurrying
over
his
dinner
in
a
manner
that
prevented
its
doing
him
any
good
as
jane
assured
him
he
sat
down
to
his
desk
when
it
was
over
and
wrote
for
the
certificate
of
his
birth
folding
and
sealing
the
letter
he
put
on
his
hat
to
go
out
again
shall
you
go
to
this
afternoon
jane
inquired
if
i
can
by
any
possibility
get
my
teaching
over
in
time
he
answered
young
finchley
hour
is
four
but
i
can
put
him
off
until
the
evening
i
dare
say
i
shall
get
up
there
by
dint
of
hurrying
halliburton
contrived
to
reach
and
arrived
there
in
much
heat
at
four
there
was
no
necessity
for
hurrying
there
on
this
particular
day
but
he
felt
impatient
to
get
the
business
over
as
if
speed
now
could
atone
for
past
neglect
carrington
was
at
home
but
engaged
and
halliburton
was
shown
into
a
room
three
or
four
others
were
waiting
there
whether
ordinary
patients
or
whether
mere
applicants
of
form
like
himself
he
could
not
tell
and
it
was
their
turn
to
go
in
before
it
was
his
but
his
turn
came
at
last
and
he
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
doctor
a
little
man
fair
and
reserved
with
powder
on
his
head
reserved
in
ordinary
intercourse
but
certainly
not
reserved
in
asking
questions
halliburton
had
never
been
so
rigidly
questioned
before
what
disorders
had
he
had
and
what
had
he
not
had
what
were
his
habits
past
and
present
one
question
came
at
last
do
you
feel
thoroughly
strong
healthy
elastic
i
feel
languid
in
hot
weather
replied
halliburton
um
appetite
sound
and
good
generally
speaking
it
has
not
been
so
good
of
late
breathing
all
right
yes
it
is
a
little
tight
sometimes
um
subject
to
a
cough
i
have
no
settled
cough
a
sort
of
hacking
cough
comes
on
at
night
occasionally
i
attribute
it
to
fatigue
um
will
you
open
your
shirt
just
unbutton
it
here
touching
the
front
and
your
flannel
waistcoat
if
you
wear
one
halliburton
bared
his
chest
in
obedience
and
the
doctor
sounded
it
and
then
put
down
his
ear
apparently
his
ear
did
not
serve
him
sufficiently
for
he
took
a
small
instrument
out
of
a
drawer
placed
it
on
the
chest
and
then
put
his
ear
to
that
changing
the
position
of
the
instrument
three
or
four
times
that
will
do
he
said
at
length
he
turned
to
put
up
his
stethoscope
again
and
halliburton
drew
the
edges
of
his
shirt
together
and
buttoned
them
why
do
you
wear
flannel
waistcoats
asked
the
doctor
with
quite
a
sharp
accent
his
head
down
in
the
drawer
i
do
wear
them
in
winter
but
in
warm
weather
i
leave
them
off
it
was
only
last
week
that
i
discarded
them
was
ever
such
folly
known
ejaculated
carrington
one
would
think
people
were
born
without
common
sense
half
the
patients
who
come
to
me
say
they
leave
off
their
flannels
in
summer
why
it
is
in
summer
they
are
most
needed
and
this
warm
weather
wo
last
either
go
home
sir
and
put
one
on
at
once
certainly
if
you
think
it
right
said
halliburton
with
a
smile
i
thank
you
for
telling
me
he
took
up
his
hat
and
waited
the
doctor
appeared
to
wait
him
to
i
understood
at
the
office
that
you
would
give
me
a
paper
testifying
that
you
had
examined
me
explained
halliburton
ah
but
i
ca
give
it
said
the
doctor
why
not
sir
because
i
am
not
satisfied
with
you
i
can
not
recommend
you
as
a
healthy
life
halliburton
pulses
quickened
a
little
sir
he
repeated
not
a
healthy
life
not
sufficiently
healthy
for
insurance
why
what
is
the
matter
with
me
he
rejoined
carrington
looked
him
full
in
the
face
for
the
space
of
a
minute
before
replying
i
have
had
that
question
asked
me
before
by
parties
whom
i
have
felt
obliged
to
decline
as
i
am
now
declining
you
he
said
and
my
answer
has
not
always
been
palatable
to
them
it
will
be
palatable
to
me
sir
in
so
far
as
that
i
desire
to
be
made
acquainted
with
the
truth
what
do
you
find
amiss
with
me
the
lungs
are
diseased
a
chill
fell
over
halliburton
not
extensively
i
trust
not
beyond
hope
of
recovery
were
i
to
say
not
extensively
i
should
be
deceiving
you
and
you
tell
me
that
you
wish
for
the
truth
they
are
extensively
diseased
a
mortal
pallor
overspread
halliburton
face
and
he
sank
into
a
chair
not
for
myself
he
gasped
as
carrington
drew
nearer
to
him
i
have
a
wife
and
children
if
i
die
they
will
want
bread
to
eat
but
you
did
not
hear
me
out
returned
the
doctor
proceeding
with
equanimity
as
if
he
had
not
been
interrupted
they
are
extensively
diseased
but
not
beyond
a
hope
of
recovery
i
do
not
say
it
is
a
strong
hope
but
a
hope
there
is
as
i
judge
provided
you
use
the
right
means
and
take
care
of
yourself
what
am
i
to
do
what
are
the
means
you
live
i
presume
in
this
stifling
foggy
smoky
london
yes
then
got
away
from
it
go
where
you
can
have
pure
air
and
a
clear
atmosphere
that
the
first
and
chief
thing
and
that
most
essential
not
for
a
few
weeks
or
months
you
understand
me
going
out
for
a
change
of
air
as
people
call
it
you
must
leave
london
entirely
go
away
altogether
but
it
will
be
impossible
urged
halliburton
my
work
lies
in
london
ah
said
the
doctor
too
many
have
been
with
me
with
whom
it
was
the
same
case
but
i
assure
you
that
you
must
leave
it
or
it
will
be
london
life
you
appear
to
me
to
be
one
who
never
ought
to
have
come
to
london
you
were
not
born
in
it
he
abruptly
added
i
never
saw
it
until
i
was
eighteen
i
was
born
and
reared
in
devonshire
just
so
i
knew
it
those
born
and
reared
in
london
become
acclimatized
to
it
generally
speaking
and
it
does
not
hurt
them
it
does
not
hurt
numbers
who
are
strangers
they
find
london
as
healthy
a
spot
for
them
as
any
on
the
face
of
the
globe
but
there
are
a
few
who
can
not
and
ought
not
to
live
in
london
and
i
judge
you
to
be
one
of
them
has
this
state
of
health
been
coming
on
long
yes
for
some
years
had
you
remained
in
devonshire
you
might
have
been
a
sound
man
all
your
life
my
only
advice
to
you
is
get
away
from
london
you
can
not
live
long
if
you
remain
in
it
halliburton
thanked
carrington
and
went
out
how
things
had
changed
for
him
what
had
gone
with
the
day
beauty
with
the
blue
sky
the
bright
sun
the
sky
was
blue
still
and
the
sun
shining
but
darkness
seemed
to
intervene
between
his
eyes
and
outward
things
dying
a
shiver
went
through
him
as
he
thought
of
jane
and
the
children
and
a
sick
feeling
of
despair
settled
on
his
spirit
chapter
vii
later
in
the
day
the
man
was
utterly
prostrated
he
felt
that
the
fiat
of
death
had
gone
forth
and
there
settled
an
undercurrent
of
conviction
in
his
mind
that
for
him
there
would
be
no
recovery
take
what
precaution
he
would
he
could
not
shake
it
off
there
lay
the
fact
and
the
fear
as
a
leaden
weight
he
bent
his
steps
towards
home
walking
the
whole
way
he
moved
along
the
streets
mechanically
the
crowds
passed
and
repassed
him
but
seemed
far
away
once
or
twice
he
lifted
his
head
to
them
with
a
yearning
gesture
oh
that
i
were
like
you
bent
on
business
on
pleasure
on
social
intercourse
passed
through
his
mind
i
am
not
as
you
and
for
me
you
can
do
nothing
you
can
not
give
me
health
you
can
not
give
me
life
he
entered
his
home
and
was
conscious
of
merry
voices
and
flitting
footsteps
a
little
scene
of
gaiety
was
going
on
he
knew
of
this
but
had
forgotten
it
until
that
instant
it
was
the
birthday
of
his
little
girl
and
a
few
young
friends
had
been
invited
to
make
merry
jane
looking
almost
as
young
quite
as
pretty
as
when
she
married
him
sat
at
the
far
end
of
their
largest
room
before
a
she
wore
festival
attire
a
dress
of
silk
and
a
thin
gold
chain
round
her
neck
the
little
girls
were
chiefly
in
white
and
the
boys
were
on
their
best
behaviour
jane
was
telling
them
that
tea
was
ready
and
her
two
servants
were
helping
to
place
the
little
people
and
to
wait
upon
them
oh
and
here
papa
too
just
in
time
she
cried
lifting
her
eyes
gladly
at
her
husband
that
is
delightful
halliburton
welcomed
the
children
he
kissed
some
he
talked
to
others
just
as
if
he
had
not
that
terrible
vulture
care
within
him
saw
nothing
amiss
neither
did
jane
he
took
his
seat
and
drank
his
tea
all
as
it
were
mechanically
it
did
not
seem
to
be
himself
he
thought
it
must
be
some
one
else
in
the
last
hour
his
whole
identity
appeared
to
have
changed
bread
and
butter
was
handed
to
him
he
took
a
slice
and
left
it
jane
put
some
cake
on
to
his
plate
he
left
that
also
eat
with
that
awful
fiat
racking
his
senses
no
it
was
not
possible
ho
looked
round
on
his
children
william
a
gentle
boy
with
his
mother
calm
good
face
and
her
earnest
eyes
jane
a
lovely
child
with
fair
curls
flowing
and
a
bright
colour
consciously
vain
this
evening
in
her
white
birthday
robes
and
her
white
ribbons
frank
a
slim
boy
always
in
mischief
his
features
handsome
and
clearly
cut
as
were
his
father
gar
a
delicate
little
chap
with
fair
curls
like
his
sister
jane
must
he
those
children
abandon
them
to
the
mercies
of
a
cold
and
cruel
world
bequeath
them
no
place
in
it
no
means
of
support
oh
god
oh
god
broke
from
his
bitter
heart
if
it
be
thy
will
to
take
me
mayst
thou
shelter
them
edgar
he
started
palpably
so
far
in
thought
was
he
away
yet
it
was
only
his
wife
who
spoke
to
him
edgar
have
you
been
up
to
dr
carrington
she
whispered
bending
towards
him
in
his
confusion
he
muttered
some
unintelligible
words
which
she
interpreted
into
a
denial
there
was
a
great
deal
of
buzzing
just
then
from
the
young
voices
around
two
of
the
gentlemen
frank
being
one
were
in
hot
contention
touching
a
third
gentleman
rabbits
halliburton
called
frank
to
order
and
said
no
more
to
her
husband
for
the
present
we
are
to
dance
after
tea
said
jane
i
have
been
learning
one
quadrille
to
play
it
is
very
easy
and
mamma
says
i
play
it
very
well
oh
we
do
want
dancing
grumbled
one
of
the
boys
we
rather
have
opinions
were
divided
again
the
girls
wanted
dancing
the
boys
halliburton
was
appealed
to
i
think
it
must
be
dancing
first
and
afterwards
said
she
tea
over
the
furniture
was
pushed
aside
to
clear
a
space
for
the
dancers
halliburton
his
back
against
the
wall
stood
looking
at
them
looking
at
them
as
was
supposed
but
had
they
been
keen
observers
they
would
have
known
that
his
eyes
in
reality
saw
not
they
like
his
thoughts
were
far
away
his
wife
did
presently
notice
that
he
seemed
particularly
abstracted
she
came
up
to
him
he
was
standing
with
his
arms
folded
his
head
bent
edgar
are
you
well
well
oh
yes
dear
he
replied
making
an
effort
to
rouse
himself
i
hope
you
have
no
more
teaching
i
ought
to
go
to
young
finchley
i
put
him
off
until
seven
then
was
her
quick
rejoinder
if
you
put
off
young
finchley
how
was
it
you
could
not
get
to
i
have
been
occupied
all
the
afternoon
jane
he
said
wanting
the
courage
to
say
how
the
matter
really
stood
he
evaded
the
question
but
to
go
to
young
finchley
or
to
any
other
pupil
that
night
halliburton
felt
himself
physically
unequal
teach
explain
abstruse
greek
and
latin
rules
with
his
mind
in
its
present
state
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
mattered
little
if
he
was
to
be
taken
from
them
so
soon
whether
he
ever
taught
again
he
was
in
the
very
depths
of
depression
suddenly
as
he
stood
looking
on
a
thought
came
flashing
over
him
as
a
ray
of
light
as
a
of
light
nay
as
a
whole
flood
of
it
what
if
carrington
were
wrong
if
it
should
prove
that
in
reality
nothing
was
the
matter
with
him
doctors
and
very
clever
ones
were
he
knew
sometimes
mistaken
perhaps
carrington
had
been
so
it
was
likely
he
went
on
to
reason
that
a
mortal
disease
should
be
upon
him
and
he
have
lived
in
ignorance
of
it
why
he
seemed
to
have
had
very
little
the
matter
with
him
nothing
to
talk
of
nothing
to
lie
up
for
comparatively
speaking
he
had
been
a
healthy
man
was
in
health
then
yes
the
belief
did
present
itself
that
carrington
was
deceived
he
in
the
interests
of
the
insurance
office
might
be
unnecessarily
cautious
halliburton
left
the
wall
and
grew
cheerful
and
gay
and
talked
freely
to
the
children
one
little
lady
asked
if
he
would
dance
with
her
he
laughed
and
felt
half
inclined
to
do
so
which
was
the
true
mood
that
sombre
one
or
this
was
there
nothing
about
this
one
was
there
no
secret
consciousness
that
it
did
not
accord
with
his
mind
actual
belief
that
he
was
only
forcing
it
be
it
as
it
would
it
did
not
last
in
the
very
middle
of
a
laughing
sentence
to
his
own
little
janey
the
old
agony
the
fear
returned
returned
with
terrific
violence
as
a
torrent
that
has
burst
its
bounds
i
bear
this
uncertainty
he
murmured
to
himself
and
he
went
out
of
the
room
and
took
up
his
hat
halliburton
who
at
that
moment
happened
to
be
crossing
from
another
room
saw
him
open
the
are
you
going
to
young
finchley
edgar
no
i
shall
give
him
holiday
for
i
shall
be
in
soon
jane
he
went
straight
to
their
own
family
doctor
a
allen
who
lived
close
by
they
were
personal
friends
to
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
allen
was
at
home
the
servant
was
about
to
usher
him
into
the
family
but
halliburton
stepped
into
the
dusky
surgery
he
was
in
no
mood
for
ladies
company
i
will
wait
here
he
said
tell
your
master
i
wish
to
say
a
word
to
him
the
surgeon
came
immediately
a
lighted
candle
in
his
hand
he
was
a
dark
man
with
a
thin
face
why
wo
you
come
in
he
asked
only
allen
and
the
girls
there
is
anything
the
matter
yes
allen
something
is
the
matter
was
halliburton
reply
i
want
a
friend
one
who
will
deal
with
me
candidly
and
openly
and
i
have
come
to
you
sit
down
they
both
sat
down
and
halliburton
gave
him
the
history
of
the
past
four
and
twenty
hours
commencing
with
the
and
ending
with
his
racking
doubts
as
to
whether
carrington
opinion
was
borne
out
by
facts
or
whether
he
might
have
been
deceived
allen
he
concluded
you
must
see
what
you
can
make
out
of
my
state
and
you
must
report
to
me
without
disguise
as
you
would
report
to
your
own
soul
the
surgeon
looked
grave
carrington
is
a
clever
man
he
said
one
whom
it
would
be
difficult
to
deceive
i
know
his
reputation
but
these
clever
men
are
not
infallible
put
his
opinion
out
of
your
mind
examine
me
yourself
and
tell
me
what
you
think
allen
proceeded
to
do
so
he
first
of
all
asked
halliburton
a
few
general
questions
as
to
his
present
state
of
health
as
he
would
have
done
by
any
other
patient
and
then
he
sounded
his
lungs
now
then
the
truth
said
halliburton
the
truth
is
so
far
as
i
can
judge
that
you
are
in
no
present
danger
whatever
neither
did
carrington
say
i
was
in
present
danger
hastily
replied
halliburton
are
my
lungs
sound
they
are
not
sound
but
neither
do
i
think
they
are
extensively
diseased
you
may
live
for
many
years
with
care
would
any
insurance
office
take
me
no
i
do
not
think
it
would
it
is
just
my
allen
if
you
look
at
it
in
that
light
i
shall
be
very
sorry
to
have
given
you
my
opinion
observed
the
surgeon
i
repeat
that
by
taking
care
of
yourself
you
may
stave
off
disease
and
live
many
years
i
would
not
say
this
unless
i
thought
it
and
would
your
opinion
be
the
same
as
the
doctor
that
i
must
leave
london
for
the
country
i
think
you
would
have
a
far
better
chance
of
getting
well
in
the
country
than
you
have
here
you
have
told
me
over
and
over
again
you
know
that
you
were
sure
london
air
was
bad
for
you
ay
i
have
replied
halliburton
i
never
have
felt
quite
well
in
it
and
that
the
truth
well
i
must
see
what
can
be
done
good
evening
if
the
edict
did
not
appear
to
be
so
irrevocably
dark
as
that
of
carrington
it
was
yet
dark
enough
and
halliburton
striving
to
look
it
full
in
the
face
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
by
troubles
less
grave
endeavoured
to
set
himself
to
think
what
could
be
done
there
was
no
possible
chance
of
keeping
it
from
his
wife
if
it
was
really
necessary
that
their
place
of
residence
should
be
changed
she
must
be
taken
into
counsel
and
the
sooner
she
was
told
the
better
he
went
home
resolved
to
tell
her
before
he
slept
the
little
troop
departed
the
children
in
bed
they
sat
together
over
the
fire
though
the
weather
had
become
warm
an
evening
fire
was
pleasant
still
he
sat
nervous
and
fidgety
now
the
moment
had
arrived
he
shrunk
from
his
task
edgar
i
am
sure
you
are
not
well
she
exclaimed
i
have
observed
it
all
the
evening
yes
jane
i
am
well
pretty
well
that
is
the
truth
is
my
darling
i
have
some
bad
news
for
you
and
i
do
like
to
tell
it
her
own
family
were
safe
and
well
under
her
roof
and
her
fears
flew
to
francis
to
margaret
to
robert
halliburton
stopped
her
it
does
not
concern
any
of
them
jane
it
is
about
myself
but
what
can
it
be
about
yourself
they
will
not
will
you
listen
to
the
news
with
a
brave
heart
he
broke
off
with
a
smile
and
the
most
cheering
look
he
could
call
up
to
his
face
oh
yes
she
smiled
too
she
thought
it
could
be
nothing
very
bad
they
will
not
insure
my
life
jane
her
heart
stood
still
but
why
not
they
consider
it
too
great
a
risk
they
fancy
i
am
not
strong
a
sudden
flush
to
her
face
a
moment
stillness
and
then
jane
halliburton
clasped
her
hands
with
a
faint
cry
of
despair
she
saw
that
more
remained
behind
chapter
viii
suspense
halliburton
sat
in
her
chair
still
enough
except
for
the
wailing
cry
which
had
just
escaped
her
lips
her
husband
would
not
look
at
her
in
that
moment
his
gaze
was
bent
on
the
fire
and
his
cheek
lay
in
his
hand
as
she
cried
out
he
stretched
forth
his
other
hand
and
let
it
fall
lightly
upon
hers
jane
had
i
thought
you
would
look
at
the
dark
side
of
the
picture
i
should
have
hesitated
to
tell
you
why
my
dear
child
the
very
fact
of
my
telling
you
at
all
should
convince
you
that
there
nothing
very
serious
the
matter
he
added
in
cheering
tones
of
reasoning
now
that
he
had
spoken
he
deemed
it
well
to
make
the
very
best
he
could
of
it
you
say
they
will
insure
your
life
well
jane
perhaps
that
expression
was
not
a
correct
one
they
have
not
declined
as
yet
to
do
so
but
carrington
says
he
can
not
give
the
necessary
certificate
as
to
my
being
a
thoroughly
sound
and
healthy
man
then
you
did
go
up
to
dr
carrington
i
did
forgive
me
jane
i
could
not
enter
upon
it
before
all
the
children
she
leaned
over
and
laid
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
tell
me
all
about
it
edgar
she
whispered
as
much
as
you
know
yourself
i
have
told
you
nearly
all
jane
i
saw
carrington
and
he
asked
me
a
great
many
questions
and
examined
me
here
touching
his
chest
he
fancies
the
organs
are
not
sound
and
declined
giving
the
certificate
that
your
chest
is
not
sound
asked
jane
he
said
the
lungs
ah
she
uttered
what
else
did
he
say
well
he
said
nothing
about
heart
or
liver
or
any
other
vital
part
so
i
conclude
they
are
all
right
and
that
there
was
nothing
to
say
replied
halliburton
attempting
to
be
cheerful
i
could
have
told
him
my
brain
was
strong
enough
had
he
asked
about
that
for
i
sure
it
gets
its
full
share
of
work
i
need
not
have
mentioned
this
to
you
at
all
jane
but
for
a
perplexing
bit
of
advice
the
doctor
gave
me
jane
sat
straight
in
her
chair
again
and
looked
at
halliburton
the
colour
was
beginning
to
return
to
her
face
he
continued
carrington
earnestly
recommends
me
to
remove
from
london
indeed
he
said
that
it
was
necessary
if
i
would
get
well
no
wonder
that
you
found
my
manner
absent
he
continued
very
rapidly
after
his
hesitation
with
that
unpalatable
counsel
to
digest
did
he
think
you
very
ill
she
breathed
he
did
not
say
i
was
ill
jane
i
am
not
very
ill
as
you
may
see
for
yourself
my
dear
what
he
said
was
that
my
lungs
were
were
diseased
she
put
in
diseased
yes
that
was
it
he
truthfully
replied
it
is
the
term
that
medical
men
apply
when
they
wish
to
indicate
delicacy
and
he
strenuously
recommended
me
to
leave
london
for
how
long
did
he
say
he
said
for
good
jane
felt
startled
how
could
it
be
done
edgar
in
truth
i
do
not
know
if
i
leave
london
i
leave
my
living
behind
me
now
you
see
why
i
was
so
absorbed
at
when
you
saw
me
go
out
i
was
going
round
to
allen
and
what
does
say
she
eagerly
interrupted
oh
he
seems
to
think
it
a
mere
nothing
compared
with
carrington
he
agreed
with
him
on
one
point
that
i
ought
to
live
out
of
london
edgar
i
will
tell
you
what
i
think
must
be
done
said
jane
after
a
pause
i
have
not
had
time
to
reflect
much
upon
it
but
it
strikes
me
that
it
would
be
advisable
for
you
to
see
another
doctor
and
take
his
opinion
some
man
who
is
clever
in
affections
of
the
lungs
go
to
him
without
any
delay
should
he
say
that
you
must
leave
london
of
course
we
must
leave
it
no
matter
what
the
sacrifice
the
advice
corresponded
with
halliburton
own
opinion
and
he
resolved
to
follow
it
a
conviction
amounting
to
a
certainty
was
upon
him
that
go
to
what
doctor
he
might
the
fiat
would
be
the
same
as
carrington
he
did
not
say
so
to
jane
on
the
contrary
he
spoke
of
these
doctors
as
being
in
the
interests
of
the
office
and
he
tried
to
deceive
his
own
heart
with
the
sophistry
shall
you
apply
to
another
office
to
insure
your
life
jane
asked
i
would
if
i
thought
it
would
not
be
useless
you
think
it
would
be
useless
the
offices
all
keep
their
own
doctors
and
those
doctors
it
is
my
belief
are
unnecessarily
particular
i
should
call
them
crotchety
jane
i
think
it
must
amount
to
this
said
jane
that
if
there
is
anything
seriously
the
matter
with
you
no
office
will
be
found
to
do
it
but
if
the
affection
is
only
trifling
or
temporary
you
may
be
accepted
that
is
about
it
oh
jane
he
added
with
an
irrepressible
burst
of
anguish
what
would
i
not
give
to
have
insured
my
life
before
this
came
upon
me
all
those
past
years
they
seem
to
have
been
allowed
to
run
to
waste
when
i
might
have
been
using
them
to
lay
up
in
store
for
the
children
how
many
are
there
of
us
who
looking
back
can
feel
that
our
past
years
in
some
way
or
other
have
been
allowed
to
run
to
waste
what
a
sleepless
night
that
was
for
him
what
a
sleepless
night
for
his
wife
both
rose
in
the
morning
equally
unrefreshed
to
what
doctor
will
you
go
jane
inquired
as
she
was
dressing
i
have
been
thinking
of
arnold
of
finsbury
he
replied
yes
you
could
not
go
to
a
better
edgar
you
will
let
me
accompany
you
no
no
jane
your
accompanying
me
would
do
no
good
you
could
not
go
into
the
room
with
me
she
saw
the
force
of
the
objection
i
shall
be
so
very
anxious
she
said
in
a
low
tone
he
laughed
at
her
he
was
willing
to
make
light
of
it
if
it
might
ease
her
fears
my
dear
i
will
come
home
at
once
and
report
to
you
i
will
borrow
jack
boots
that
i
may
come
to
you
the
quicker
you
know
that
i
be
anxious
she
repeated
feeling
vexed
jane
he
said
his
tone
changing
i
see
that
you
are
more
anxious
already
than
is
good
for
you
it
is
not
well
that
you
should
be
so
i
wish
i
could
be
with
you
i
wish
i
could
hear
as
you
will
arnold
opinion
from
his
own
lips
was
all
she
answered
i
will
faithfully
repeat
it
to
you
said
halliburton
faithfully
word
for
word
on
your
honour
yes
jane
i
will
you
have
my
promise
good
news
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
tell
you
and
should
it
be
the
worst
it
will
be
necessary
that
you
should
know
it
you
must
be
there
before
ten
she
observed
otherwise
there
will
be
little
chance
of
seeing
him
i
shall
be
there
by
nine
jane
to
spare
time
later
would
interfere
too
much
with
my
day
work
a
thought
crossed
jane
mind
if
the
fiat
were
unfavourable
what
would
become
of
his
day
work
then
all
his
days
but
she
did
not
utter
it
oh
papa
cried
janey
at
breakfast
was
it
not
a
beautiful
party
did
you
enjoy
yourself
so
much
before
i
do
suppose
you
ever
did
janey
he
replied
in
kindly
tones
no
that
i
never
did
alice
harvey
birthday
comes
in
summer
and
she
says
she
knows
her
mamma
will
let
her
give
just
such
another
mamma
turning
to
halliburton
well
jane
shall
you
let
me
have
a
new
frock
for
it
you
know
i
tore
mine
last
night
all
in
good
time
janey
we
do
know
where
we
may
all
be
then
no
they
did
not
a
foreshadowing
of
it
was
already
upon
the
spirit
of
halliburton
not
upon
the
children
they
were
spared
it
as
yet
do
not
be
surprised
if
you
see
me
waiting
for
you
when
you
come
out
of
arnold
said
jane
to
her
husband
in
low
tones
as
he
was
going
out
but
jane
why
indeed
i
think
it
would
be
foolish
of
you
to
come
my
dear
i
never
knew
you
like
this
before
perhaps
not
but
when
before
had
there
been
cause
for
this
apprehension
jane
watched
him
depart
calm
as
she
contrived
to
remain
outwardly
she
was
in
a
terribly
restless
nervous
state
little
accustomed
as
she
was
so
to
give
way
a
sick
feeling
was
within
her
a
miserable
sensation
of
suspense
and
she
could
scarcely
battle
with
it
you
may
have
felt
the
same
in
the
dread
approach
of
some
great
calamity
the
reading
over
janey
got
her
books
about
as
usual
halliburton
took
charge
of
her
education
in
every
branch
excepting
music
for
that
she
had
a
master
she
would
not
send
jane
to
school
the
child
sat
down
to
her
books
and
was
surprised
at
seeing
her
mother
come
into
the
room
with
her
things
on
mamma
are
you
going
out
for
a
little
time
jane
oh
let
me
go
let
me
go
too
not
this
morning
dear
you
will
have
plenty
of
work
preparing
the
lessons
that
you
could
not
prepare
last
night
so
i
shall
said
janey
i
thought
perhaps
you
meant
to
excuse
them
mamma
it
was
almost
for
jane
to
remain
in
the
house
in
her
present
state
of
agitation
she
knew
that
it
did
appear
absurdly
foolish
to
go
after
her
husband
but
walk
somewhere
she
must
how
could
she
turn
a
different
way
from
that
which
he
had
taken
it
was
some
distance
to
finsbury
half
an
hour
walk
at
least
should
she
go
or
should
she
not
she
asked
herself
as
she
went
out
of
the
house
she
began
to
think
that
she
might
have
remained
at
home
had
she
exercised
she
had
a
great
mind
to
turn
back
and
was
slackening
her
pace
when
she
caught
sight
of
allen
at
his
surgery
window
an
impulse
came
over
her
that
she
would
go
in
and
ask
his
opinion
of
her
husband
she
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
surgeon
was
making
up
some
pills
you
are
out
early
mrs
halliburton
yes
she
replied
halliburton
has
gone
to
finsbury
square
to
see
arnold
and
i
do
you
think
him
very
ill
she
abruptly
broke
off
i
do
not
myself
carrington
did
you
know
he
had
been
to
dr
carrington
asked
allen
almost
fearing
he
might
be
betraying
secrets
i
know
all
about
it
i
know
what
the
doctor
said
do
you
think
carrington
was
mistaken
in
a
measure
there
no
doubt
the
lungs
are
affected
but
i
believe
not
to
the
grave
extent
assumed
by
dr
carrington
he
assumed
then
that
they
were
affected
to
a
grave
extent
she
hastily
repeated
her
heart
beating
faster
i
thought
you
said
you
knew
all
about
it
mrs
halliburton
so
i
do
he
may
possibly
not
have
told
me
the
very
worst
said
by
carrington
but
he
told
me
quite
sufficient
allen
tell
me
do
you
think
that
there
is
a
chance
of
his
recovery
most
certainly
i
do
warmly
replied
the
surgeon
every
chance
halliburton
i
see
no
reason
whatever
why
he
should
not
keep
as
well
as
he
is
now
and
live
for
years
provided
he
takes
care
of
himself
it
appears
that
carrington
very
strongly
urged
his
removing
into
the
country
he
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
was
his
only
chance
for
life
and
in
that
i
think
he
went
too
far
again
but
the
country
would
undoubtedly
do
for
him
what
london
will
not
you
think
that
he
ought
to
remove
to
the
country
she
inquired
showing
no
sign
of
the
terror
those
incautious
words
brought
her
his
only
chance
for
life
i
do
if
it
be
possible
for
him
to
manage
his
affairs
so
as
to
get
away
i
should
say
let
him
do
so
by
all
means
it
be
done
you
know
allen
if
it
is
essential
in
my
judgment
it
should
be
done
many
and
many
a
time
i
have
said
to
him
myself
a
pity
but
that
you
could
be
out
of
this
heavy
london
fogs
affect
him
and
smoke
affects
him
the
air
altogether
affects
him
and
i
only
wonder
it
has
not
told
upon
him
before
as
carrington
observed
to
him
there
are
some
constitutions
which
somehow
will
not
thrive
here
halliburton
rose
with
a
sigh
i
am
glad
you
do
not
think
so
very
seriously
of
him
she
breathed
i
do
not
think
of
him
at
all
was
the
surgeon
answer
i
confess
that
he
is
not
strong
and
that
he
must
have
care
the
pure
air
of
the
country
and
relaxation
from
some
of
his
most
pressing
work
may
do
wonders
for
him
if
i
might
advise
i
should
say
let
no
pecuniary
considerations
keep
him
here
and
that
is
very
disinterested
advice
halliburton
concluded
the
doctor
laughing
for
in
losing
you
i
should
lose
both
friends
and
patients
jane
went
out
those
ominous
words
were
still
ringing
in
her
ears
his
only
chance
for
life
forcing
herself
to
she
did
go
to
meet
halliburton
she
returned
home
and
took
off
her
things
and
gave
what
attention
she
could
to
jane
lessons
but
none
can
tell
the
suspense
that
was
agitating
her
the
glances
she
cast
to
the
window
to
see
him
pass
she
went
and
stood
there
at
last
she
saw
him
coming
along
in
the
distance
she
would
have
liked
to
fly
to
meet
him
to
say
what
is
the
news
but
she
did
not
more
patience
and
then
when
he
came
in
at
the
front
door
she
left
the
room
she
was
in
and
went
with
him
into
the
her
face
white
as
death
he
saw
how
agitated
she
was
strive
as
she
would
for
calmness
he
stood
looking
at
her
with
a
smile
well
jane
it
is
not
so
very
formidable
after
all
her
face
grew
hot
and
her
heart
bounded
on
what
does
arnold
say
you
know
edgar
you
promised
me
the
truth
without
disguise
you
shall
have
it
jane
arnold
opinion
of
me
is
not
unfavourable
that
the
lungs
are
to
a
certain
extent
affected
is
indisputable
and
he
thinks
they
have
been
so
for
some
time
but
he
sees
nothing
to
indicate
present
danger
to
life
he
believes
that
i
may
grow
into
an
old
man
yet
jane
breathed
freely
a
word
of
earnest
thanks
went
up
from
her
heart
with
proper
diet
he
has
given
me
certain
rules
for
living
and
pure
air
and
sunshine
he
considers
that
i
have
really
little
to
fear
i
told
you
jane
those
insurance
doctors
make
the
worst
of
things
arnold
then
recommends
the
country
observed
jane
paying
no
attention
to
the
last
remark
very
strongly
almost
as
strongly
as
dr
carrington
jane
lifted
her
eyes
to
her
husband
face
carrington
said
you
know
that
it
was
your
only
chance
of
life
not
quite
as
bad
as
that
jane
he
returned
never
supposing
but
he
must
himself
have
let
the
remark
slip
and
wondering
how
he
came
to
do
so
what
carrington
said
was
that
it
was
london
life
it
is
the
same
thing
edgar
and
now
what
is
to
be
done
of
course
we
have
no
alternative
into
the
country
we
must
go
the
question
is
where
ay
that
is
the
question
he
answered
not
only
where
but
what
to
do
i
can
not
drop
down
into
a
fresh
place
and
expect
teaching
to
surround
me
at
once
as
if
it
had
been
waiting
for
me
but
i
have
not
time
to
talk
now
only
fancy
it
is
ten
halliburton
went
out
and
jane
remained
fastened
as
it
were
to
her
chair
a
hundred
perplexing
plans
and
schemes
were
already
working
in
her
brain
chapter
ix
seeking
a
home
plans
and
schemes
continued
to
work
in
halliburton
brain
for
days
and
days
to
come
many
and
many
an
anxious
consultation
did
she
and
her
husband
hold
together
where
should
they
go
what
should
they
do
that
it
was
necessary
to
do
something
and
speedily
events
proved
independently
of
what
had
been
said
by
the
doctors
before
another
month
had
passed
over
his
head
halliburton
had
become
so
much
worse
that
he
had
to
resign
his
post
at
king
college
but
to
the
hopeful
minds
of
himself
and
jane
the
country
change
was
to
bring
its
remedy
for
all
ills
they
had
grown
to
anticipate
it
with
enthusiasm
his
thoughts
naturally
ran
upon
teaching
as
his
continued
occupation
he
knew
nothing
of
any
other
all
england
was
before
him
and
he
supposed
he
might
obtain
a
living
at
it
wherever
he
might
go
such
testimonials
as
his
were
not
met
with
every
day
his
cousin
julia
had
married
a
man
of
some
local
influence
as
halliburton
had
understood
in
the
city
in
which
they
resided
the
chief
town
of
one
of
the
midland
counties
and
a
thought
crossed
his
mind
more
than
once
whether
it
might
not
be
well
to
choose
that
same
town
to
settle
in
they
might
be
able
to
recommend
me
you
see
jane
he
observed
to
his
wife
one
evening
as
they
were
sitting
together
after
the
children
were
in
bed
not
that
i
should
much
like
to
ask
any
favour
of
julia
why
not
said
jane
because
she
is
not
a
pleasant
person
to
ask
a
favour
of
it
is
many
years
since
i
saw
her
but
i
well
remember
that
another
reason
why
i
feel
inclined
to
that
place
is
that
it
is
a
cathedral
town
cathedral
towns
have
many
of
the
higher
order
of
the
clergy
in
them
learning
is
sure
to
be
considered
there
should
it
not
be
anywhere
else
consequently
there
would
be
an
opening
for
classical
teaching
jane
thought
the
argument
had
weight
and
there
yet
another
thing
continued
halliburton
you
remember
peach
peach
peach
repeated
jane
as
if
unable
to
recall
the
name
the
young
fellow
i
had
so
much
trouble
with
a
few
years
ago
drilling
him
between
his
terms
at
oxford
but
for
me
he
never
would
have
passed
either
his
great
or
his
little
go
he
did
get
plucked
the
first
time
he
went
up
you
must
remember
him
jane
he
has
often
taken
tea
with
us
here
oh
yes
yes
i
remember
him
now
charley
peach
well
he
has
recently
been
appointed
to
a
minor
canonry
in
that
same
cathedral
resumed
halliburton
jacobs
told
me
of
it
the
other
day
now
i
am
quite
sure
that
peach
would
be
delighted
to
say
a
word
for
me
or
to
put
anything
in
my
way
that
is
another
reason
why
i
am
inclined
to
go
there
i
suppose
the
town
is
a
healthy
one
ay
that
it
is
and
it
is
seated
in
one
of
the
most
charming
of
our
counties
there
be
no
london
fogs
or
smoke
there
then
edgar
let
us
decide
upon
it
yes
i
think
so
unless
we
should
hear
of
an
opening
elsewhere
that
may
promise
better
we
must
be
away
by
midsummer
if
we
can
or
soon
after
it
will
be
sharp
work
though
what
trouble
it
will
be
to
pack
the
furniture
she
exclaimed
pack
what
furniture
jane
we
must
sell
the
furniture
sell
the
furniture
she
uttered
aghast
my
dear
it
would
never
do
to
take
the
furniture
down
it
would
cost
almost
as
much
as
it
is
worth
there
no
knowing
either
how
long
it
might
be
upon
the
road
or
what
damage
it
might
receive
i
expect
it
would
have
to
go
principally
by
water
by
water
cried
halliburton
i
fancy
so
by
barge
i
mean
waggons
would
not
take
it
except
by
paying
heavily
a
great
deal
of
the
country
traffic
is
done
by
water
this
furniture
is
old
jane
most
of
it
and
will
not
bear
rough
travelling
consider
how
many
years
your
father
and
mother
had
it
in
use
then
what
should
we
do
for
furniture
when
we
get
there
asked
jane
buy
new
with
the
money
we
receive
from
the
sale
of
this
i
have
been
reflecting
upon
it
a
good
deal
jane
and
fancy
it
will
be
the
better
plan
however
if
you
care
for
this
old
furniture
we
must
take
it
jane
looked
round
upon
it
she
did
care
for
the
furniture
but
she
knew
how
old
it
was
and
was
willing
to
do
whatever
might
be
best
a
vision
came
into
her
mind
of
fresh
bright
furniture
and
it
looked
pleasant
in
imagination
it
would
certainly
be
a
great
deal
to
pack
and
carry
she
acknowledged
and
some
of
it
is
not
worth
it
and
it
would
be
more
than
we
should
want
resumed
halliburton
wherever
we
go
we
must
be
content
with
a
small
house
at
any
rate
at
first
but
it
will
be
time
enough
to
go
into
these
details
jane
when
we
have
finally
decided
upon
our
destination
oh
edgar
i
shall
be
so
sorry
to
take
the
boys
from
king
college
jane
he
said
a
flash
of
pain
crossing
his
face
as
he
spoke
there
are
so
many
things
connected
with
it
altogether
that
cause
me
sorrow
that
my
only
resource
is
not
to
think
upon
them
i
might
be
tempted
to
repine
to
ask
in
a
spirit
of
rebellion
why
this
affliction
should
have
come
upon
us
it
is
god
decree
and
it
is
my
duty
to
submit
as
patiently
as
i
can
it
was
her
duty
also
and
she
knew
it
as
she
laid
her
hand
upon
her
weary
brow
a
weary
weary
brow
from
henceforth
that
of
jane
halliburton
chapter
x
a
dying
bed
in
a
handsome
chamber
of
a
handsome
house
in
birmingham
an
old
man
lay
dying
for
most
of
his
life
he
had
been
engaged
in
a
large
wholesale
business
had
achieved
local
position
had
accumulated
moderate
wealth
but
neither
wealth
nor
position
can
ensure
peace
to
a
and
the
old
man
lay
on
his
groaning
over
the
past
the
season
was
that
of
not
the
winter
following
the
intended
removal
of
halliburton
from
london
as
spoken
of
in
the
last
chapter
but
the
winter
preceding
it
for
it
is
necessary
to
go
back
a
little
a
hard
sharp
white
day
in
january
and
the
fire
was
piled
high
in
the
sick
room
and
the
large
flakes
of
snow
piled
themselves
outside
on
the
window
frames
and
beat
against
the
glass
the
room
was
fitted
up
with
every
comfort
the
most
fastidious
invalid
could
desire
and
yet
i
say
nothing
seemed
to
bring
comfort
to
the
invalid
lying
there
his
hands
were
clenched
as
in
mortal
agony
his
eyes
were
apparently
watching
the
falling
snow
the
eyes
saw
it
not
in
reality
they
were
cast
back
to
where
his
mind
was
the
past
what
could
be
troubling
him
was
it
that
loss
only
two
years
ago
by
which
of
his
savings
had
been
engulfed
scarcely
a
man
dying
as
he
knew
he
was
would
be
unlikely
to
care
about
that
now
ample
competence
had
remained
to
him
and
he
had
neither
son
nor
daughter
to
inherit
hark
what
is
it
that
he
is
murmuring
between
his
parched
lips
to
the
accompaniment
of
his
clenched
hands
i
see
it
all
now
i
see
it
all
while
we
are
buoyed
up
with
health
and
strength
we
continue
hard
selfish
obstinate
in
our
wickedness
but
when
death
comes
we
awake
to
our
error
and
death
has
come
to
me
and
i
have
awakened
to
mine
why
did
i
turn
him
out
like
a
dog
he
had
neither
kith
nor
kin
and
i
sent
him
adrift
on
the
world
to
fight
with
it
or
to
starve
he
was
the
only
child
of
my
sister
and
she
was
gone
she
and
i
were
of
the
same
father
and
mother
we
shared
the
same
meals
in
childhood
the
same
home
the
same
play
the
same
hopes
she
wrote
to
me
when
she
was
dying
as
i
am
dying
now
should
my
poor
boy
be
left
fatherless
for
my
husband
health
seems
to
be
failing
be
his
friend
and
protector
for
helen
sake
and
may
heaven
bless
you
for
it
and
i
scoffed
at
the
injunction
when
the
boy
offended
me
and
turned
him
out
i
have
to
answer
for
it
the
last
anxious
doubt
was
uttered
more
audibly
than
the
rest
it
escaped
from
his
lips
with
a
groan
a
woman
who
was
dozing
over
the
fire
started
up
did
you
call
sir
no
go
out
and
leave
me
but
go
out
and
leave
me
he
repeated
with
anger
little
fitted
to
his
position
and
the
woman
was
speeding
from
the
room
when
he
caught
at
the
curtain
and
recalled
her
are
they
not
come
not
yet
sir
but
with
this
heavy
fall
it
not
to
be
wondered
at
the
highways
must
be
almost
impassable
with
good
roads
they
might
have
been
here
hours
ago
she
went
out
he
lay
back
on
his
pillow
his
eyes
wide
open
but
wearing
the
same
dreamy
look
you
may
be
wondering
who
he
is
though
you
probably
guess
for
you
have
heard
of
him
once
before
as
cooper
the
uncle
who
discarded
edgar
halliburton
i
must
give
you
a
few
words
of
retrospect
richard
cooper
was
the
eldest
of
three
children
the
others
were
a
brother
and
a
sister
richard
alfred
and
helen
alfred
and
helen
both
married
richard
never
did
marry
it
was
somewhat
singular
that
the
brother
and
sister
should
both
die
each
leaving
an
orphan
and
that
the
orphans
should
find
a
home
in
the
house
of
their
uncle
richard
julia
cooper
the
brother
orphan
was
the
first
to
come
to
it
a
long
time
before
edgar
halliburton
came
helen
had
married
the
rev
william
halliburton
and
she
died
at
his
rectory
in
devonshire
sending
that
earnest
prayer
to
her
brother
richard
which
you
have
just
heard
him
utter
a
little
while
and
her
husband
the
rector
also
died
and
then
it
was
that
edgar
went
up
to
his
uncle
richard
fortunate
for
these
two
orphan
children
it
appeared
to
be
that
their
uncle
had
not
married
and
could
give
them
a
good
home
a
good
home
he
did
give
them
julia
left
it
first
to
become
the
wife
of
anthony
dare
a
solicitor
in
large
practice
in
a
distant
city
she
married
him
very
soon
after
her
cousin
edgar
came
to
his
uncle
and
it
was
after
the
marriage
of
julia
that
edgar
was
discarded
and
turned
adrift
years
many
years
had
gone
by
since
then
and
here
lay
richard
cooper
stricken
for
death
and
repenting
of
the
harshness
which
he
had
not
repented
of
or
sought
to
atone
for
all
through
those
long
years
ah
my
friends
whatsoever
may
lie
upon
our
consciences
however
we
may
have
contrived
to
ignore
it
during
our
busy
lives
be
assured
that
it
will
find
us
out
on
our
richard
cooper
lay
back
on
his
pillow
his
eyes
wide
open
with
their
inward
tribulation
who
knows
but
there
would
be
time
yet
he
suddenly
murmured
and
the
thought
appeared
to
rouse
his
mind
and
flush
his
cheek
and
he
lifted
his
hand
and
grasped
the
ringing
it
so
loudly
as
to
bring
two
servants
to
the
room
go
up
one
of
you
to
lawyer
weston
he
uttered
bring
him
back
with
you
tell
him
i
want
to
alter
my
will
and
that
there
may
yet
be
time
do
send
one
of
go
he
repeated
in
tones
of
agonising
entreaty
bring
him
bring
him
back
with
you
as
the
echo
of
his
voice
died
away
there
came
a
loud
summons
at
the
street
door
as
of
a
hasty
arrival
sir
cried
one
of
the
maids
they
come
at
last
i
thought
i
heard
a
carriage
drawing
up
in
the
snow
who
come
he
asked
in
some
confusion
of
mind
weston
not
him
sir
and
dare
replied
the
servant
as
she
hurried
out
a
lady
and
gentleman
were
getting
out
of
a
coach
at
the
door
a
tall
very
tall
man
with
handsome
features
but
an
unpleasantly
free
expression
the
lady
was
tall
also
stout
and
fair
with
an
imperious
look
in
her
little
nose
are
we
in
time
the
latter
asked
of
the
servants
it
nearly
as
much
as
can
be
said
was
the
answer
but
he
has
roused
up
in
the
last
hour
and
is
growing
excited
the
doctors
thought
it
might
be
so
that
he
not
continue
in
the
lethargy
to
the
last
they
went
on
at
once
to
the
sick
chamber
every
sense
of
the
dying
man
appeared
to
be
on
the
alert
his
hands
were
holding
back
the
curtain
his
eyes
were
strained
on
the
door
why
have
you
been
so
long
he
cried
in
a
voice
of
strength
they
were
surprised
to
hear
dear
uncle
said
dare
bending
over
the
bed
and
clasping
the
feeble
hands
we
started
the
very
moment
the
letter
came
but
we
could
not
get
along
the
roads

dreadfully
heavy

whispered
a
servant
in
the
invalid
ear

the
prompt

dare

hungry
and
thirsty
after
your
journey
but
you
must
wait
life
not
ebbing
out
of
you
as
it
is
out
of
me
we
get
this
matter
over
that
my
mind
may
be
so
far
at
rest
and
then
you
can
eat
and
drink
of
the
best
that
my
house
affords
i
am
in
mortal
pain
anthony
dare
dare
was
silently
removing
some
of
her
outer
wrappings
and
whispering
with
the
servant
at
the
extremity
of
the
roomy
chamber
but
dare
who
had
taken
off
his
and
hat
in
the
hall
continued
to
stand
by
the
sick
bed
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
sir
he
said
in
reply
to
concluding
sentence
can
the
medical
men
afford
you
no
relief
it
is
pain
of
mind
anthony
dare
not
pain
of
body
pain
has
passed
from
me
i
would
have
sent
for
you
and
julia
before
but
i
did
not
think
until
yesterday
that
the
end
was
so
near
never
let
a
man
be
guilty
of
injustice
broke
forth
cooper
vehemently
or
let
him
know
that
it
will
come
home
to
him
to
trouble
his
dying
bed
what
can
i
do
for
you
sir
questioned
dare
if
you
will
open
that
bureau
you
find
pen
ink
and
paper
julia
come
here
and
see
that
we
are
alone
the
servant
left
the
room
and
dare
came
forward
divested
of
her
cloaks
she
wore
a
handsome
satin
dress
much
the
fashion
at
that
time
with
a
good
deal
of
rich
white
lace
about
it
a
heavy
gold
chain
and
some
very
showy
amethysts
set
in
gold
the
jewellery
was
real
however
not
sham
but
altogether
her
attire
looked
somewhat
out
of
place
for
a
the
afternoon
was
drawing
to
a
close
what
with
that
and
the
dense
atmosphere
outside
the
chamber
had
grown
dim
dare
disposed
the
writing
materials
on
a
small
round
table
at
the
invalid
elbow
and
then
looked
towards
the
distant
window
i
fear
i
can
not
see
sir
without
a
light
call
for
it
julia
said
the
invalid
a
lamp
was
brought
in
and
placed
on
the
table
so
that
its
rays
should
not
affect
those
eyes
so
soon
to
close
to
all
earthly
light
and
dare
waited
pen
in
hand
i
have
been
hard
and
wilful
began
cooper
putting
up
his
trembling
hands
i
have
been
obdurate
and
selfish
and
unjust
and
now
it
is
keeping
peace
from
me
but
in
what
way
dear
uncle
softly
put
in
dare
and
it
may
as
well
be
remarked
that
whenever
dare
attempted
to
speak
softly
and
kindly
it
seemed
to
bear
an
unnatural
sound
to
others
ears
in
what
way
why
with
regard
to
edgar
halliburton
said
cooper
the
dew
breaking
out
upon
his
brow
in
seeking
to
follow
the
calling
marked
out
for
him
by
his
father
he
only
did
his
duty
and
i
should
have
seen
it
in
that
light
but
for
my
own
obstinate
pride
and
i
did
wrong
to
discard
him
i
have
done
wrong
ever
since
in
keeping
him
from
me
in
refusing
to
be
reconciled
are
you
listening
anthony
dare
certainly
sir
i
hear
julia
i
say
that
there
was
no
reason
for
my
turning
him
away
there
has
been
no
reason
for
my
keeping
him
away
i
have
refused
to
be
reconciled
i
have
sent
back
his
letters
unopened
i
have
held
him
at
contemptuous
defiance
when
i
heard
that
he
had
married
i
cast
harsh
words
to
him
because
he
had
not
asked
my
consent
though
i
was
aware
all
the
time
that
i
had
given
him
no
opportunity
to
ask
it
i
had
harshly
refused
all
overtures
all
intercourse
i
cast
harsh
words
to
his
wife
knowing
her
not
but
i
see
my
error
now
do
you
see
it
julia
do
you
see
it
anthony
dare
would
you
like
to
have
him
sent
for
sir
suggested
dare
it
is
too
late
he
could
not
be
here
in
time
i
do
know
either
where
he
lives
in
london
or
what
his
address
may
be
do
you
looking
at
his
niece
oh
dear
no
she
replied
with
a
slightly
contemptuous
gesture
of
the
shoulders
as
much
as
to
imply
that
to
know
the
address
of
her
cousin
edgar
was
quite
beneath
her
no
he
could
not
get
here
repeated
the
dying
man
whilst
dare
wiped
the
dews
that
had
gathered
on
his
pallid
and
wrinkled
brow
julia
anthony
anthony
dare
sir
what
is
it
i
wish
you
both
to
listen
to
me
i
can
not
die
with
this
injustice
unrepaired
i
have
made
my
will
in
julia
favour
it
is
all
left
to
her
except
a
few
trifles
to
my
servants
when
the
property
comes
to
be
realised
there
will
be
at
least
sixteen
thousand
pounds
and
but
for
that
late
mad
speculation
i
entered
into
there
would
have
been
nearly
forty
thousand
he
paused
but
neither
nor
dare
answered
you
are
a
lawyer
anthony
and
could
draw
up
a
fresh
will
but
no
time
i
say
what
is
darkening
the
room
he
abruptly
broke
off
to
ask
dare
looked
hastily
up
nothing
was
darkening
the
room
except
the
gradually
increasing
gloom
of
evening
my
sight
is
growing
dim
then
said
the
invalid
listen
to
me
both
of
you
i
charge
you
anthony
and
julia
dare
that
you
divide
this
money
with

to
a
farthing

feel
that

not
ere

be
drawn
up
i
should
be
gone
and

not
sign
it
but
i

the
bequests
to
my
servants
may
be
equally
divided
between
my
nephew
edgar
and
my
niece
julia
the
dying
man
paused
i
think
that
all
that
need
be
said
he
observed
have
you
finished
writing
it
anthony
dare
dare
wrote
fast
and
quickly
and
was
concluding
the
last
words
it
is
written
sir
read
it
dare
proceeded
to
do
so
short
as
the
time
was
which
it
took
to
accomplish
this
the
old
man
had
fallen
into
a
doze
ere
it
was
concluded
a
doze
or
a
partial
stupor
they
could
not
tell
which
but
in
leaning
over
him
he
woke
up
with
a
start
i
ca
die
with
this
injustice
unrepaired
he
cried
his
memory
evidently
ignoring
what
had
just
been
done
anthony
dare
your
wife
has
no
right
to
all
my
money
i
shall
leave
half
of
it
to
edgar
i
want
you
to
write
it
down

done

is
the
paper
where
where
why
do
you
get
light
into
the
room
it
dark
dark
this
is
this
it
as
dare
put
it
into
his
hand
now
mind
he
added
his
tone
changing
to
one
of
solemn
enjoinder
mind
you
act
upon
it
julia
has
no
right
to
more
than
her
half
share
she
must
not
take
more
money
kept
by
wrong
acquired
by
injustice
never
prospers
it
would
not
bring
you
good
it
would
not
bring
a
blessing
give
edgar
his
legal
half
and
give
him
his
old
uncle
love
and
contrition
tell
him
if
the
past
could
come
over
again
there
should
be
no
estrangement
between
us
he
lay
panting
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
spoke
again
the
paper
having
fallen
unnoticed
from
his
hand
julia
when
you
see
edgar
wife
did
i
sign
that
paper
he
broke
off
no
sir
said
dare
will
you

ay
but
signed
or
not
signed
you
equally
act
upon
it
i
do
put
it
forth
as
a
legal
document
i
suppose
it
would
not
in
this
informal
state
stand
good
in
law
it
is
only
a
reminder
to
you
anthony
dare
that
you
may
not
forget
my
wishes
hold
me
up
in
bed
and
have
lights
brought
in
anthony
dare
drew
the
curtain
back
and
the
rays
of
the
lamp
flashed
upon
the
dying
man
dare
looked
round
for
a
book
on
which
to
place
the
paper
while
it
was
signed
i
want
a
light
came
again
from
the
bed
in
a
pleading
tone
julia
why
do
you
tell
them
to
bring
in
the
lamp
the
lamp
is
here
uncle
it
is
close
to
you
then
there
no
oil
in
it
he
cried
julia
i
have
lights
here
tell
them
to
bring
up
the
lamps
do
ring
go
and
see
that
they
are
brought
unwilling
to
oppose
him
and
doubting
lest
his
sight
should
really
have
gone
dare
went
out
and
returned
with
one
of
the
servants
and
more
light
cooper
was
then
lying
back
on
his
pillow
dozing
and
unconscious
has
he
signed
the
paper
dare
whispered
to
her
husband
he
shook
his
head
negatively
and
pointed
to
it
it
was
lying
on
the
bed
just
as
dare
had
left
it
dare
caught
it
up
from
any
prying
eyes
that
might
be
about
folded
it
and
held
it
securely
in
her
hand
he
will
wake
up
again
presently
and
can
sign
it
then
observed
dare
just
as
a
gentle
ring
was
heard
at
the
house
door
it
the
doctor
said
the
servant
i
know
his
ring
but
the
old
man
never
did
sign
the
paper
and
never
woke
up
again
he
lay
in
a
state
of
lethargy
throughout
the
night
and
dare
watched
by
his
bedside
the
servants
watched
and
the
doctors
came
in
at
intervals
but
there
was
no
change
in
his
state
until
the
last
great
change
it
occurred
at
daybreak
and
when
the
neighbours
opened
their
windows
to
the
cold
and
the
snow
the
house
of
richard
cooper
remained
closed
death
was
within
it
chapter
xi
helstonleigh
i
believe
that
most
of
the
readers
of
the
channings
will
not
like
this
story
less
because
its
scene
is
laid
in
the
same
place
helstonleigh
i
narrate
to
you
as
you
may
have
already
discovered
a
great
deal
of
truth
of
events
that
have
actually
happened
combined
with
fiction
i
can
only
do
this
from
my
own
personal
experience
by
taking
you
to
the
scenes
and
places
where
i
have
lived
of
this
same
town
helstonleigh
i
could
relate
to
you
volumes
no
place
in
the
world
holds
so
green
a
spot
in
my
memory
do
you
remember
longfellow
poem
my
lost
youth
often
i
think
of
the
beautiful
town
that
is
seated
by
the
sea
often
in
thought
go
up
and
down
the
pleasant
streets
of
that
dear
old
town
and
my
youth
comes
back
to
me
and
a
verse
of
a
lapland
song
is
haunting
my
memory
still
boy
will
is
the
wind
will
and
the
thoughts
of
youth
are
long
long
thoughts
i
remember
the
gleams
and
glooms
that
dart
across
the
schoolboy
brain
the
song
and
the
silence
in
the
heart
that
in
part
are
prophecies
and
in
part
are
longings
wild
and
vain
and
the
voice
of
that
fitful
song
sings
on
and
is
never
still
boy
will
is
the
wind
will
and
the
thoughts
of
youth
are
long
long
thoughts
there
are
things
of
which
i
may
not
speak
there
are
dreams
that
can
not
die
there
are
thoughts
that
make
the
strong
heart
weak
and
bring
a
pallor
into
the
cheek
and
a
mist
before
the
eye
and
the
words
of
that
fatal
song
come
over
me
like
a
chill
boy
will
is
the
wind
will
and
the
thoughts
of
youth
are
long
long
thoughts
strange
to
me
now
are
the
forms
i
meet
when
i
visit
the
dear
old
town
but
the
native
air
is
pure
and
sweet
and
the
trees
that
each
street
as
they
balance
up
and
down
are
singing
the
beautiful
song
are
sighing
and
whispering
still
boy
will
is
the
wind
will
and
the
thoughts
of
youth
are
long
long
thoughts
and
deering
woods
are
fresh
and
fair
and
with
joy
that
is
almost
pain
my
heart
goes
back
to
wander
there
and
among
the
dreams
of
the
days
that
were
i
find
my
lost
youth
again
and
the
music
of
that
old
song
throbs
in
my
memory
still
boy
will
is
the
wind
will
and
the
thoughts
of
youth
are
long
long
thoughts
those
are
some
of
its
verses
and
what
deering
is
to
longfellow
helstonleigh
is
to
me
the
birmingham
came
into
helstonleigh
one
summer
night
and
stopped
at
its
destination
the
hotel
bringing
with
it
some
london
passengers
the
direct
line
of
rail
to
helstonleigh
from
london
was
not
then
opened
and
this
may
serve
to
tell
you
how
long
it
is
ago
a
lady
and
a
little
girl
stepped
from
the
inside
of
the
coach
and
a
gentleman
and
three
boys
got
down
from
the
outside
the
latter
were
soaking
almost
immediately
after
leaving
birmingham
to
which
place
the
rail
had
conveyed
them
the
rain
had
commenced
to
pour
in
torrents
and
those
outside
received
its
full
benefit
the
coach
was
crammed
inside
and
out
but
with
the
other
passengers
we
have
nothing
to
do
we
have
with
these
they
were
the
halliburtons
for
the
town
which
halliburton
had
been
desirous
to
remove
to
the
one
in
which
his
cousin
dare
resided
was
no
other
than
helstonleigh
halliburton
drew
a
long
face
when
she
set
eyes
on
her
condition
edgar
you
must
be
wet
through
and
through
yes
i
am
there
was
no
help
for
it
you
should
have
come
inside
when
i
wanted
you
to
do
so
she
cried
in
a
voice
of
distress
you
should
indeed
and
have
suffered
you
to
take
my
place
outside
nonsense
jane
jane
looked
at
the
hotel
we
had
better
remain
here
for
the
night
what
do
you
think
yes
i
think
so
he
replied
it
is
too
wet
to
go
about
looking
after
anything
that
might
be
less
expensive
inquire
if
we
can
have
rooms
jane
whilst
i
see
after
the
luggage
halliburton
went
in
leading
janey
and
was
confronted
by
the
barmaid
a
smart
young
woman
in
a
smart
cap
can
we
sleep
here
she
inquired
yes
certainly
how
many
beds
i
will
go
up
with
you
and
see
said
halliburton
be
so
kind
as
not
to
put
us
in
your
more
expensive
rooms
she
added
in
a
lower
tone
the
barmaid
looked
at
her
from
top
to
toe
as
it
is
much
in
the
habit
of
barmaids
to
do
when
such
a
request
is
preferred
she
saw
a
lady
in
a
black
silk
dress
a
cashmere
shawl
and
a
plain
straw
bonnet
trimmed
with
white
simple
as
the
attire
was
quiet
as
was
the
demeanour
there
was
that
about
halliburton
in
her
voice
her
accent
her
bearing
altogether
which
proclaimed
her
the
gentlewoman
and
the
barmaid
condescended
to
be
civil
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
rooms
she
said
i
call
the
chambermaid
my
goodness
you
had
better
get
those
wet
things
off
sir
unless
you
want
to
be
laid
up
with
cold
the
words
were
uttered
in
surprise
as
her
eyes
encountered
halliburton
he
looked
taller
and
thinner
and
handsomer
than
ever
but
he
had
a
hollow
cough
now
and
his
cheek
was
hectic
and
he
was
certainly
wet
through
the
chambermaid
allotted
them
rooms
halliburton
after
rubbing
himself
dry
with
towels
got
into
a
warmed
bed
and
had
warm
drink
supplied
to
him
jane
after
unpacking
what
would
be
wanted
for
the
night
returned
to
the
to
which
her
children
had
been
shown
a
maid
seeing
the
boys
clothes
were
damp
had
lighted
a
fire
and
they
were
kneeling
round
it
having
been
provided
with
bread
and
butter
and
milk
intelligent
truthful
boys
they
were
with
clear
skins
and
bright
honest
eyes
and
open
countenances
janey
had
fallen
asleep
on
a
chair
her
flaxen
curls
making
her
a
pillow
on
its
elbow
the
boys
crowded
to
one
side
of
the
fireplace
when
their
mother
came
in
leaving
the
larger
space
for
her
and
william
rose
and
gave
her
a
chair
halliburton
sat
down
having
laid
on
the
table
a
book
of
common
prayer
which
she
had
brought
in
her
hand
mamma
i
hope
papa
will
not
be
ill
oh
william
i
fear
it
such
a
terrible
wetting
and
to
be
so
long
in
it
how
is
it
that
he
was
so
much
worse
than
you
are
because
he
sat
at
the
end
and
the
gentleman
next
him
did
not
hold
the
umbrella
over
him
at
all
when
it
came
on
to
rain
some
of
the
passengers
had
umbrellas
and
some
had
not
so
they
were
divided
for
the
best
we
three
had
one
between
us
and
we
were
wedged
in
between
two
fat
old
men
who
helped
to
keep
us
dry
what
a
pity
there
was
not
a
place
for
papa
inside
yes
or
if
he
would
only
have
taken
mine
cried
halliburton
a
wetting
would
not
have
hurt
me
as
it
may
hurt
him
what
place
did
they
call
that
william
where
i
got
out
to
ask
him
to
change
bromsgrove
lickey
mamma
you
have
had
no
tea
i
do
not
care
for
any
she
sighed
hers
was
a
hopeful
nature
but
something
within
her
this
evening
seemed
to
whisper
of
trial
for
the
future
she
turned
to
the
table
where
stood
the
remains
of
the
children
meal
cut
a
piece
of
bread
from
the
loaf
and
slowly
spread
it
with
butter
then
she
poured
out
a
little
milk
dear
mamma
do
have
some
tea
cried
william
that
nothing
but
our
milk
and
water
she
shook
her
head
and
took
the
milk
tea
would
only
be
an
additional
expense
and
she
was
too
completely
dispirited
to
care
what
she
drank
i
will
read
now
she
said
taking
up
the
and
afterwards
i
think
you
had
better
say
your
prayers
here
near
the
fire
as
you
have
been
so
wet
she
chose
a
short
psalm
and
read
it
aloud
then
the
children
knelt
down
each
at
a
separate
chair
to
say
their
prayers
in
silence
not
as
children
prayers
are
sometimes
hurried
over
knelt
they
but
with
lowly
reverence
their
heads
bowed
their
young
hearts
lifted
never
doubting
but
they
were
heard
by
god
they
had
been
trained
in
a
good
school
did
you
ever
have
a
sale
of
old
things
goods
and
chattels
which
may
have
served
your
purpose
and
looked
well
in
their
places
seem
so
old
when
they
come
to
be
exhibited
that
you
feel
of
them
and
as
to
the
sum
they
realise
you
will
not
have
much
trouble
in
hoarding
it
had
halliburton
known
the
small
sum
that
would
be
the
result
of
his
sale
had
jane
dreamt
that
they
would
go
for
an
old
song
they
had
never
consented
to
part
with
them
better
have
been
at
the
cost
of
carrying
them
to
helstonleigh
their
bedding
blankets
they
did
take
and
it
was
well
they
did
so
i
feel
almost
afraid
to
tell
you
how
very
little
money
they
had
in
hand
when
they
arrived
all
their
worldly
wealth
was
little
more
than
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
debts
had
to
be
paid
before
leaving
london
and
it
cost
money
to
give
up
their
house
without
notice
for
their
landlord
was
severe
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
and
with
this
they
had
to
buy
fresh
furniture
and
to
live
until
teaching
came
in
a
forlorn
prospect
on
which
to
recommence
the
world
no
wonder
that
jane
shunned
even
tea
at
the
inn
or
any
other
expense
that
might
lessen
their
funds
but
hope
is
buoyant
in
the
human
heart
and
unless
it
were
so
half
the
world
might
lay
themselves
down
to
die
morning
came
a
bright
sunny
beautiful
morning
after
the
rain
not
apparently
had
halliburton
suffered
his
limbs
felt
a
little
stiff
but
that
would
go
off
before
the
day
closed
their
plans
were
to
take
a
small
house
as
cheap
a
one
as
they
could
find
in
accordance
with
you
really
must
for
once
excuse
the
word
gentility
that
a
tolerably
fair
appearance
was
necessary
to
halliburton
success
as
a
teacher
a
dry
healthy
spot
a
little
way
out
of
the
town
mused
the
landlord
of
the
star
to
whom
they
communicated
their
desire
the
london
road
would
be
the
place
then
and
you
probably
will
find
there
such
a
house
as
you
require
they
found
their
way
to
the
london
road
a
healthy
suburb
of
the
town
and
there
discovered
a
house
they
thought
might
suit
them
a
house
of
good
appearance
inclosed
by
iron
railings
and
standing
a
little
back
from
the
road
a
was
on
either
side
the
entrance
a
kitchen
at
the
back
three
bedrooms
were
above
and
above
these
again
was
a
garret
a
small
garden
was
behind
the
house
and
beyond
that
was
a
field
which
did
not
belong
to
them
the
adjoining
house
was
similar
to
this
one
but
that
possessed
a
large
and
productive
garden
an
inmate
of
that
house
showed
them
over
this
one
dressed
as
a
quakeress
her
features
were
plain
but
her
complexion
was
fair
and
delicate
and
she
had
calm
blue
eyes
the
rent
of
the
house
is
pounds
per
annum
she
said
in
reply
to
halliburton
question
it
belongs
to
thomas
ashley
but
thee
must
not
apply
to
him
i
will
furnish
thee
with
the
address
of
the
agent
who
has
the
letting
of
friend
ashley
houses
it
is
anthony
dare
you
will
find
the
house
pleasant
and
healthy
if
you
decide
upon
it
she
added
speaking
to
both
of
them
the
latter
name
had
struck
upon
halliburton
ear
jane
he
whispered
to
his
wife
that
must
be
the
dare
who
married
my
cousin
julia
cooper
his
name
was
anthony
dare
halliburton
proceeded
alone
to
the
office
of
dare
the
gentleman
you
met
at
cooper
halliburton
returning
to
her
children
at
the
hotel
they
had
decided
to
take
the
house
dare
was
not
at
home
in
london
with
his
wife
the
head
clerk
said
but
the
clerk
had
power
to
let
the
house
halliburton
gave
him
some
particulars
with
regard
to
himself
and
they
were
considered
satisfactory
but
he
did
not
mention
that
he
was
related
to
dare
the
next
thing
was
about
furniture
the
clerk
directed
halliburton
to
a
warehouse
where
both
new
and
things
might
be
obtained
and
he
proceeded
to
it
calling
in
at
the
star
for
his
wife
she
knew
a
great
deal
more
about
furniture
than
he
they
did
the
best
they
could
spending
about
fifty
pounds
a
kidderminster
carpet
was
bought
for
the
best
the
other
room
which
was
to
be
study
and
the
bedrooms
went
for
the
present
without
any
we
will
buy
all
those
things
when
we
have
succeeded
a
bit
said
halliburton
chapter
xii
anna
lynn
they
slept
that
night
again
at
the
star
and
the
following
morning
early
they
and
their
furniture
took
possession
together
of
the
house
a
busy
day
they
found
it
arranging
things
jane
who
had
determined
as
the
saying
runs
to
put
her
shoulder
to
the
wheel
not
only
on
this
day
but
on
future
days
did
not
intend
to
engage
a
regular
servant
that
like
the
carpets
might
be
indulged
in
as
they
succeeded
but
in
the
mean
time
she
thought
a
young
girl
might
be
found
who
would
come
in
for
a
few
hours
daily
and
do
what
they
wanted
done
in
the
course
of
the
morning
the
fair
pleasant
face
of
the
quakeress
was
seen
approaching
the
back
door
from
the
garden
she
wore
a
lilac
print
gown
a
net
kerchief
crossed
under
it
on
her
neck
and
the
peculiar
net
cap
with
its
high
caul
and
neat
little
border
i
have
stepped
in
to
ask
if
i
can
help
thee
with
thy
work
she
began
thee
hast
plenty
to
do
setting
things
straight
and
thy
husband
does
not
look
strong
i
will
aid
if
thee
pleasest
you
are
very
kind
to
be
so
thoughtful
for
a
stranger
replied
jane
charmed
with
the
straightforward
frankness
of
the
quakeress
i
hope
you
will
first
tell
me
to
whom
i
am
indebted
thee
can
call
me
patience
was
the
ready
reply
i
live
next
door
with
samuel
lynn
and
his
daughter
anna
his
wife
died
soon
after
the
child
was
born
i
was
related
to
anna
lynn
and
when
she
was
departing
she
sent
for
me
and
begged
me
not
to
leave
her
child
unless
samuel
should
take
unto
himself
another
wife
but
that
appears
to
be
far
from
his
thoughts
he
loves
the
child
much
she
is
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
is
lynn
in
business
asked
jane
not
on
his
own
account
now
he
was
a
glove
manufacturer
as
a
young
man
but
he
had
not
a
large
capital
and
when
the
british
ports
were
opened
for
the
admission
of
gloves
from
the
french
it
ruined
him
as
it
did
many
others
in
the
city
only
the
rich
masters
could
stand
that
numbers
went
then
went
echoed
jane
went
where
to
ruin
ah
i
remember
it
though
it
is
a
long
time
ago
now
it
was
i
think
in
the
year
i
can
not
describe
to
thee
the
distress
and
destruction
it
brought
upon
this
city
until
then
so
flourishing
the
manufacturers
had
to
close
their
works
and
the
men
went
about
the
streets
starving
did
the
distress
continue
long
for
weeks
and
months
and
years
the
town
will
never
be
again
in
that
respect
what
it
has
been
samuel
lynn
was
a
man
of
integrity
and
he
gave
up
business
while
he
could
pay
everyone
and
accepted
the
post
of
manager
in
the
manufactory
of
thomas
ashley
thomas
ashley
is
one
of
the
first
manufacturers
in
the
city
as
his
father
was
before
him
when
thee
shall
know
the
place
and
the
people
better
thee
will
find
that
there
is
not
a
name
more
respected
throughout
helstonleigh
than
that
of
thomas
ashley
i
suppose
he
is
a
rich
man
yes
he
is
rich
replied
patience
who
was
as
busy
with
her
hands
as
she
was
in
talking
his
household
is
expensive
and
he
keeps
his
open
and
his
close
carriages
but
for
all
that
he
must
be
putting
by
money
it
is
not
for
his
riches
that
thomas
ashley
is
respected
but
for
his
high
character
there
is
not
a
more
just
man
living
than
thomas
ashley
there
is
not
a
manufacturer
in
the
town
who
is
so
considerate
and
kind
to
his
workmen
his
rate
of
wages
is
on
the
highest
scale
and
he
is
incapable
of
oppression
he
has
a
son
and
daughter
he
the
boy
causes
him
much
uneasiness
and
cost
is
he
not
steady
hastily
asked
jane
bless
thee
it
is
not
that
was
the
laughing
answer
of
patience
he
is
but
a
young
boy
yet
when
he
was
fourteen
months
old
the
nurse
let
him
fall
from
her
arms
from
the
first
landing
to
the
hall
below
at
first
they
thought
he
was
not
hurt
margaret
ashley
herself
thought
it
the
doctors
thought
it
but
in
a
little
time
injury
grew
apparent
it
lay
in
one
of
the
hips
he
is
often
in
great
pain
and
will
be
lame
for
life
abscess
after
abscess
forms
in
the
hip
they
take
him
to
the
to
doctors
in
london
but
nothing
cures
him
a
beautiful
boy
as
you
ever
saw
but
his
hurt
renders
him
peevish
he
is
fond
of
books
and
david
byrne
who
is
a
latin
and
greek
scholar
goes
daily
to
instruct
him
but
the
boy
is
thrown
back
by
his
fits
of
illness
it
is
a
great
grief
to
thomas
and
margaret
ashley
they
why
anna
is
it
thee
what
dost
thou
do
here
halliburton
turned
from
the
kitchen
cupboard
where
she
and
patience
were
arranging
crockery
to
behold
a
little
girl
who
was
no
doubt
anna
lynn
dark
blue
eyes
were
deeply
set
beneath
their
long
lashes
which
lay
on
a
damask
and
dimpled
cheek
her
pretty
teeth
shone
like
pearls
between
her
smiling
lips
and
her
chestnut
hair
fell
in
a
mass
of
careless
curls
upon
her
neck
never
halliburton
thought
had
she
seen
a
face
so
lovely
jane
was
a
pretty
child
but
jane
faded
into
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
vision
standing
there
thee
has
thy
cap
off
again
anna
cried
the
quakeress
with
some
asperity
of
tone
art
thee
not
ashamed
to
be
so
bold
going
about
with
thy
head
uncovered
the
cap
came
off
patience
gently
responded
anna
she
had
a
sweetly
timid
manner
a
modest
expression
thee
need
not
tell
me
what
is
untrue
when
the
cap
is
tied
on
it
will
not
come
off
unless
purposely
removed
go
home
and
put
it
on
thee
may
come
back
again
perhaps
friend
halliburton
will
permit
thee
to
stay
awhile
with
her
children
who
are
arranging
their
books
in
the
study
is
thy
french
lesson
learnt
not
quite
replied
anna
running
away
she
returned
with
a
pretty
little
white
net
cap
on
the
model
of
that
worn
by
patience
her
luxuriant
curls
were
pushed
under
it
and
the
crimped
border
rested
on
the
fair
forehead
nay
there
is
no
call
to
put
all
thy
hair
out
of
sight
child
said
patience
where
are
thy
combs
in
my
hair
patience
patience
took
off
the
cap
formed
two
flat
curls
by
means
of
the
combs
on
either
side
the
temples
put
the
cap
on
again
and
tucked
the
rest
of
the
hair
smoothly
under
it
halliburton
then
took
anna
hand
and
led
her
to
her
own
children
what
a
pity
it
is
to
hide
her
hair
she
said
afterwards
to
patience
dost
thee
think
so
it
is
the
custom
with
our
people
anna
hair
is
fine
and
of
a
curly
nature
brush
it
as
i
will
it
curls
and
she
has
acquired
a
habit
of
taking
her
cap
off
when
i
am
not
watching
her
father
i
grieve
to
say
will
let
her
sit
by
the
hour
together
her
hair
down
as
thee
saw
it
now
and
her
cap
anywhere
i
believe
he
thinks
nothing
she
does
is
wrong
i
talk
to
him
much
i
never
saw
a
more
beautiful
child
said
jane
warmly
i
grant
thee
that
she
is
fair
but
she
is
eleven
years
old
now
and
her
vanity
should
be
checked
she
is
sometimes
invited
to
the
ashleys
where
she
sees
the
mode
in
which
mary
ashley
is
dressed
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
world
and
it
sets
her
longing
samuel
lynn
will
not
listen
to
me
he
is
pleased
that
his
child
should
be
received
there
as
mary
ashley
equal
he
can
not
forget
the
time
when
he
was
in
a
good
position
himself
who
teaches
anna
she
attends
a
small
school
for
friends
kept
by
ruth
darby
it
is
the
holidays
now
her
father
educates
her
well
she
learns
french
and
drawing
and
other
branches
of
study
suitable
for
girls
take
care
let
me
help
thee
with
that
heavy
table
presently
they
went
to
see
how
things
were
getting
on
in
the
study
jane
could
not
keep
her
eyes
from
the
face
of
that
lovely
child
it
partly
hindered
her
work
which
there
was
little
need
of
on
that
busy
day
a
day
so
busy
that
they
were
all
glad
when
it
was
over
and
they
were
at
liberty
to
retire
to
rest
rarely
had
jane
witnessed
so
beautiful
a
view
as
that
which
met
her
sight
the
following
morning
when
she
drew
up
her
blind
the
previous
day
had
been
hazy
nothing
was
to
be
seen
now
the
atmosphere
had
cleared
the
great
extent
of
scenery
spread
around
the
green
fields
the
growing
corn
the
sparkling
rivulets
the
woods
with
their
darker
and
their
brighter
trees
the
undulating
slopes
all
were
charming
but
beyond
all
and
far
more
charming
bounding
the
landscape
in
the
distant
horizon
stretched
the
long
chain
of
the
malvern
hills
as
the
sun
cast
upon
them
its
light
and
shade
their
outline
so
clearly
depicted
against
the
sky
and
their
white
villas
peeping
out
from
the
trees
at
their
base
jane
felt
that
she
could
have
gazed
for
ever
a
wondrous
picture
is
that
of
malvern
as
seen
from
helstonleigh
in
the
freshness
of
the
early
morning
edgar
she
impulsively
exclaimed
turning
to
the
bed
for
halliburton
had
not
risen
you
never
saw
anything
more
beautiful
than
the
view
from
this
window
i
am
sure
half
the
londoners
never
dreamt
of
anything
like
it
there
was
no
reply
perhaps
he
may
be
still
asleep
she
thought
but
upon
approaching
the
bed
she
saw
that
his
eyes
were
open
jane
he
gasped
i
am
ill
she
repeated
a
spasm
darting
through
her
heart
every
limb
is
paining
me
my
head
aches
and
i
am
burning
with
fever
i
have
felt
it
coming
on
all
night
she
bent
down
she
felt
his
hands
and
his
hot
face
all
burning
as
he
said
with
fever
we
must
call
in
a
doctor
she
quietly
said
suppressing
every
sign
of
dismay
that
it
might
not
agitate
him
i
will
ask
patience
to
recommend
one
yes
better
have
a
doctor
at
once
what
will
become
of
us
if
i
should
be
going
to
have
an
illness
stay
edgar
do
not
give
way
to
sad
anticipations
she
gently
said
a
brave
mind
you
know
goes
half
way
towards
a
cure
it
is
the
effect
of
that
wetting
the
cold
must
have
been
smouldering
within
you
smouldering
only
to
burst
out
the
fiercer
for
delay
patience
spoke
in
favour
of
their
own
medical
man
a
parry
who
lived
near
them
and
had
a
large
practice
he
came
and
pronounced
the
malady
to
be
rheumatic
fever
chapter
xiii
illness
for
nine
weeks
halliburton
never
left
his
bed
his
wife
was
worn
to
a
shadow
what
with
waiting
upon
him
and
battling
with
her
anxiety
her
body
was
weary
her
heart
was
sick
do
know
the
cost
of
illness
jane
knew
it
then
in
two
weeks
more
he
could
leave
his
and
crawl
about
the
room
and
by
that
time
he
was
all
eagerness
to
commence
his
operations
for
the
future
i
must
have
some
cards
printed
jane
he
cried
one
morning
halliburton
professor
of
classics
and
mathematics
late
of
col
or
should
it
be
simply
halliburton
he
broke
off
to
deliberate
i
wonder
what
the
custom
may
be
down
here
i
think
you
should
wait
until
you
are
stronger
before
you
order
your
cards
was
jane
reply
but
i
can
be
getting
things
in
train
jane
i
have
been
how
many
weeks
is
it
now
eleven
to
be
sure
it
was
june
when
we
came
it
is
now
september
i
have
been
obliged
to
neglect
the
boys
lessons
too
they
have
been
very
good
and
quiet
have
gone
on
with
their
lessons
themselves
if
we
have
trouble
in
other
ways
we
have
a
blessing
in
our
children
edgar
they
are
thoroughly
loving
and
dutiful
i
do
know
the
ordinary
terms
of
the
neighbourhood
he
resumed
after
an
interval
of
silence
and
i
wonder
if
people
will
want
references
jane
after
another
silence
you
must
put
your
things
on
and
go
to
mrs
dare
to
mrs
dare
she
echoed
now
i
do
know
her
never
mind
about
not
knowing
her
he
eagerly
continued
she
is
my
cousin
you
must
ask
whether
they
will
allow
themselves
to
be
referred
to
peach
will
allow
it
also
i
am
quite
certain
do
go
jane
invalids
in
the
weak
state
of
halliburton
are
apt
to
be
restlessly
impatient
when
the
mind
is
set
upon
any
plan
or
project
jane
found
that
it
would
vex
him
much
if
she
declined
to
go
to
dare
and
she
prepared
for
the
visit
patience
directed
her
to
their
residence
it
was
situated
at
the
opposite
end
of
helstonleigh
a
handsome
house
inclosed
in
a
high
wall
and
bearing
the
imposing
title
of
pomeranian
knoll
jane
entered
the
iron
gates
walked
round
the
carriage
drive
that
inclosed
the
lawn
and
rang
the
house
bell
a
showy
footman
in
light
blue
livery
with
a
bunch
of
cords
on
his
shoulder
answered
it
can
i
see
mrs
dare
what
name
jane
gave
in
one
of
her
visiting
cards
wondering
whether
that
was
not
too
grand
a
proceeding
considering
the
errand
upon
which
she
had
come
she
was
shown
into
an
elegant
room
to
the
presence
of
dare
that
lady
was
in
a
costly
morning
dress
with
chains
rings
bracelets
and
other
glittering
jewellery
about
her
as
she
had
worn
the
evening
you
saw
her
beside
cooper
mrs
halliburton
she
was
repeating
in
doubt
when
jane
entered
her
eyes
strained
on
the
card
what
mrs
halliburton
she
added
not
very
civilly
turning
her
eyes
upon
jane
jane
explained
the
wife
of
edgar
halliburton
dare
cousin
dare
presence
of
mind
wholly
forsook
her
she
grew
deathly
white
she
caught
at
a
chair
for
support
she
was
utterly
unable
to
speak
or
to
conceal
her
agitation
jane
could
only
look
at
her
in
amazement
wondering
whether
she
was
seized
with
sudden
illness
a
few
moments
and
she
recovered
herself
she
took
a
seat
motioned
jane
to
another
and
asked
as
she
might
have
asked
of
any
stranger
what
her
business
might
be
jane
explained
it
somewhat
at
length
dare
surprise
was
great
she
could
not
or
would
not
understand
and
her
face
flushed
a
deep
red
and
again
grew
deadly
pale
edgar
halliburton
come
to
live
in
helstonleigh
she
repeated
and
you
say
you
are
his
wife
i
am
his
wife
was
the
reply
of
jane
spoken
with
quiet
dignity
is
it
that
you
say
he
has
in
view
in
coming
here
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
i
had
explained
and
jane
went
over
the
ground
again
why
he
had
been
obliged
to
leave
london
and
his
reasons
for
settling
in
helstonleigh
you
could
not
have
come
to
a
worse
place
said
dare
who
appeared
to
be
annoyed
almost
beyond
repression
masters
of
all
sorts
are
so
plentiful
here
that
they
tread
on
each
other
heels
discouraging
news
and
jane
heart
beat
fast
on
hearing
it
my
husband
thought
you
and
dare
would
kindly
interest
yourselves
for
him
he
knows
that
peach
will
no
interrupted
dare
in
decisive
tones
for
edgar
own
sake
i
must
decline
to
recommend
him
or
indeed
to
interfere
at
all
it
would
only
encourage
fallacious
hopes
masters
are
here
in
abundance
i
speak
of
private
masters
they
do
find
half
enough
to
do
schools
are
also
plentiful
the
best
thing
will
be
to
go
to
some
place
where
there
is
a
better
opening
and
not
to
settle
himself
here
at
all
but
we
have
already
settled
here
replied
jane
a
thought
suddenly
struck
dare
it
can
never
be
edgar
who
has
taken
ashley
cottage
in
the
london
road
i
remember
the
name
was
said
to
be
halliburton
the
same
it
was
let
to
us
by
dare
clerk
dare
sat
biting
her
lips
that
she
was
grievously
annoyed
was
evident
but
in
deference
to
good
manners
which
were
partially
returning
to
her
she
strove
to
repress
its
signs
i
presume
your
husband
is
poor
mrs
halliburton
we
are
very
poor
it
is
generally
the
case
with
teachers
as
i
have
observed
well
i
can
only
give
one
answer
to
your
application
that
we
must
decline
all
interference
i
hope
edgar
will
not
think
of
applying
again
to
us
upon
the
subject
jane
rose
dare
remained
seated
and
yet
she
prided
herself
upon
her
good
breeding
i
had
forgotten
a
question
which
my
husband
particularly
desired
me
to
ask
jane
said
turning
back
as
she
was
moving
to
the
door
edgar
saw
by
the
papers
that
his
uncle
cooper
died
the
beginning
of
the
year
did
he
remember
him
on
his
so
far
as
to
send
a
message
of
reconciliation
strange
to
say
the
countenance
of
dare
again
changed
now
to
a
burning
heat
now
to
a
livid
pallor
she
hesitated
in
her
answer
yes
she
said
at
length
cooper
so
far
relented
as
to
send
him
his
forgiveness
my
nephew
edgar
if
you
ever
see
him
that
i
am
sorry
for
my
harshness
that
i
would
treat
him
differently
were
the
time
to
come
over
again
i
do
not
remember
the
precise
words
but
they
were
to
that
effect
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
would
have
wished
to
be
reconciled
but
time
did
not
allow
it
i
should
have
written
to
edgar
of
this
had
i
been
acquainted
with
his
address
a
letter
addressed
to
king
college
would
always
have
found
him
but
he
will
be
glad
to
hear
this
he
also
bade
me
ask
how
cooper
money
was
left
if
you
would
kindly
give
him
the
information
dare
bent
her
head
she
was
busy
playing
with
her
bracelet
the
will
was
proved
in
doctors
commons
edgar
halliburton
may
see
it
by
paying
a
shilling
there
it
was
not
a
gracious
answer
and
jane
paused
he
can
not
go
to
commons
he
is
not
in
london
she
gently
said
dare
raised
her
head
a
look
speaking
plainly
of
defiance
had
settled
itself
on
her
features
it
was
left
to
me
the
whole
of
it
except
a
few
trifling
legacies
to
his
servants
what
could
edgar
halliburton
expect
i
am
sure
that
he
did
not
expect
anything
observed
jane
though
i
believe
a
hope
has
sometimes
crossed
his
mind
that
cooper
might
at
the
last
relent
and
remember
him
nay
said
dare
he
had
behaved
too
disobediently
for
that
first
in
opposing
his
uncle
wishes
that
he
should
enter
into
business
secondly
in
his
marriage
in
his
marriage
echoed
jane
a
flush
rising
to
her
own
face
it
was
so
cooper
was
exceedingly
exasperated
when
he
heard
that
edgar
had
married
he
looked
upon
the
marriage
i
believe
as
undesirable
for
him
in
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
you
must
pardon
my
speaking
of
this
to
you
personally
you
appear
to
wish
for
the
truth
the
flush
on
jane
face
deepened
to
crimson
it
is
true
that
i
had
no
money
she
said
but
i
am
the
daughter
of
a
clergyman
and
was
reared
a
gentlewoman
i
suppose
my
uncle
thought
edgar
halliburton
should
have
married
a
fortune
however
all
that
is
past
and
gone
and
it
will
do
no
good
to
recall
it
i
am
sorry
that
you
should
have
been
so
for
your
own
interests
as
to
fix
on
this
place
to
come
to
dare
rose
she
had
sat
all
this
time
jane
had
stood
tell
edgar
from
me
that
i
am
sorry
to
hear
of
his
illness
tell
him
there
is
no
possible
chance
of
success
for
him
in
helstonleigh
no
opening
whatever
when
i
say
that
i
hope
he
will
speedily
remove
to
some
place
less
overdone
with
masters
i
speak
only
in
his
own
interest
she
rang
the
bell
as
she
spoke
and
gave
jane
the
tips
of
two
of
her
fingers
the
footman
held
open
the
hall
door
and
bowed
her
out
jane
went
down
the
gravel
sweep
determined
never
again
to
trouble
dare
joseph
cried
dare
sharply
should
that
lady
ever
call
again
i
am
not
at
home
remember
very
well
was
the
man
reply
dare
did
not
stay
to
hear
it
she
had
flown
upstairs
to
her
room
in
trepidation
there
she
attired
herself
hastily
and
went
out
bending
her
steps
towards
dare
office
it
was
situated
at
the
end
of
the
town
and
the
door
displayed
a
brass
plate
dare
solicitor
dare
entered
the
outer
room
is
dare
alone
she
asked
of
the
clerks
no
ashley
is
with
him
chafing
at
the
answer
for
she
was
in
a
mood
of
great
impatience
of
inward
tremor
dare
waited
for
a
few
minutes
ashley
came
out
a
man
of
nearly
forty
years
rather
above
the
middle
height
with
a
fresh
complexion
dark
eyes
and
features
a
good
man
his
wife
was
a
cousin
of
dare
dare
was
seated
at
his
table
in
his
own
room
when
his
wife
came
in
she
had
turned
again
of
an
ashy
paleness
and
she
dropped
into
a
chair
near
to
him
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
in
astonishment
are
you
ill
i
think
i
shall
die
she
gasped
i
have
had
a
mortal
fright
anthony
dare
rose
he
was
about
to
get
her
some
water
or
to
call
for
it
but
she
caught
his
arm
stay
and
hear
me
stay
anthony
those
halliburtons
have
come
to
helstonleigh
come
to
live
here
dare
mouth
opened
what
halliburtons
he
presently
asked
he
has
come
here
to
settle
he
wants
to
teach
and
his
wife
has
been
with
me
asking
us
to
be
referees
of
course
i
put
the
stopper
upon
that
the
idea
of
having
poor
relations
in
the
town
who
get
their
living
by
teaching
a
very
disagreeable
idea
indeed
for
those
who
were
playing
first
fiddle
in
the
place
and
expected
to
play
it
still
but
not
for
that
did
the
man
and
wife
stand
gazing
at
each
other
and
the
naturally
bold
look
on
dare
face
had
faded
considerably
just
then
she
asked
about
the
will
said
dare
dropping
her
voice
to
a
whisper
and
looking
round
with
a
shiver
i
thought
i
should
have
died
with
fear
dare
rallied
his
courage
any
little
reminiscence
that
may
have
momentarily
disturbed
his
equanimity
he
shook
off
and
was
his
own
bold
self
again
nonsense
julia
what
is
there
to
fear
the
will
is
proved
and
acted
upon
whatever
the
old
man
may
have
uttered
to
us
in
his
death
ramblings
was
heard
by
ourselves
alone
if
any
one
heard
it
i
should
not
much
care
a
will
a
will
all
the
world
over
and
to
act
against
it
would
be
illegal
dare
sat
wiping
her
brow
and
gathering
up
courage
it
came
back
by
slow
degrees
anthony
we
must
get
them
out
of
helstonleigh
for
more
reasons
than
one
we
must
get
them
out
they
are
in
that
house
of
mr
ashley
he
looked
surprised
they
ay
to
be
sure
the
name
in
the
books
is
halliburton
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
it
could
be
they
i
wonder
if
they
are
poor
very
poor
the
wife
said
just
so
said
dare
with
a
pleasant
smile
i
not
ask
for
the
rent
this
quarter
but
let
it
go
on
a
bit
we
may
get
them
out
mrs
dare
you
need
not
be
told
that
anthony
dare
and
his
wife
had
omitted
to
act
upon
cooper
dying
injunction
at
the
time
they
did
really
intend
to
fulfil
it
they
were
not
thieves
or
forgers
but
edgar
halliburton
was
not
present
to
remind
them
of
his
claims
and
when
the
money
came
to
be
realised
to
be
in
their
own
hands
there
it
was
suffered
to
remain
waiting
for
him
of
course
they
did
not
know
precisely
where
to
find
him
and
did
not
take
any
trouble
to
inquire
very
tempting
and
useful
they
found
the
money
a
large
portion
of
their
own
share
went
in
paying
back
debts
for
they
lived
at
an
extravagant
rate
and
and
in
short
they
had
intrenched
upon
that
other
share
and
could
not
now
have
paid
it
over
had
they
been
ever
so
willing
to
do
so
no
wonder
that
dare
had
felt
as
one
in
mortal
fear
when
she
met

halliburton
face
to
face
chapter
xiv
a
christmas
dream
winter
had
come
to
helstonleigh
frost
hovered
in
the
air
and
rested
on
the
ground
how
was
halliburton
he
had
never
once
been
out
since
his
illness
and
he
sat
by
the
fire
when
he
did
not
lie
in
bed
and
his
cough
was
racking
him
he
might
and
probably
would
have
recovered
health
under
more
favourable
auspices
but
anxiety
of
mind
was
killing
him
their
money
was
dwindling
to
a
close
and
delicacies
they
dared
not
get
for
him
halliburton
would
say
he
did
not
require
them
could
not
eat
them
if
they
were
procured
poor
man
he
craved
for
them
in
his
inmost
heart
strange
to
say
he
did
not
see
his
own
danger
or
rather
it
would
have
been
strange
but
that
similar
cases
are
met
with
every
day
when
this
cold
weather
has
passed
and
spring
is
in
then
i
shall
get
up
my
strength
was
his
constant
cry
then
i
shall
set
about
my
work
in
earnest
and
make
my
arrival
and
my
plans
known
to
peach
it
has
been
of
no
use
troubling
him
beforehand
false
false
hopes
fond
delusive
hopes
carrington
had
said
that
if
he
of
himself
he
might
live
and
be
well
the
other
doctors
had
said
the
same
and
there
was
no
reason
to
doubt
their
judgment
but
they
had
not
bargained
for
an
attack
of
rheumatic
fever
or
for
the
increased
injury
to
the
lungs
which
the
same
cause
that
past
soaking
had
induced
on
christmas
eve
he
and
jane
were
sitting
over
the
fire
in
the
twilight
he
could
come
downstairs
now
indeed
he
did
not
appear
to
be
so
ill
as
he
really
was
the
surgeon
who
attended
him
in
the
fever
had
been
discharged
long
ago
there
nothing
the
matter
with
me
now
but
debility
and
only
time
will
bring
me
out
of
that
halliburton
said
when
he
dismissed
him
jane
was
hopeful
more
hopeful
by
fits
and
starts
than
continuously
so
but
she
did
really
believe
he
might
get
well
when
winter
had
passed
they
were
sitting
beside
the
fire
when
a
great
bustle
interrupted
them
all
the
children
trooped
in
at
once
with
the
noise
it
is
the
delight
of
children
not
to
stir
without
frank
who
had
been
out
had
entered
the
house
with
his
arms
full
of
holly
and
ivy
his
bright
face
glowing
with
excitement
the
others
were
attending
him
to
show
off
the
prize
look
at
all
this
christmas
mamma
cried
he
i
have
bought
it
bought
it
repeated
jane
my
dear
frank
did
i
not
tell
you
we
must
do
without
christmas
this
year
but
it
cost
nothing
mamma
only
a
penny
jane
sighed
she
did
not
say
to
the
children
that
even
a
penny
was
no
longer
nothing
you
know
that
penny
i
have
kept
in
my
pocket
a
long
while
went
on
frank
in
excitement
addressing
the
assemblage
well
i
thought
if
mamma
would
not
buy
some
christmas
i
would
but
you
did
not
buy
all
that
for
a
penny
frank
we
should
pay
sixpence
for
it
in
london
i
did
though
mamma
i
had
it
of
that
old
man
who
lives
in
the
cottage
higher
up
the
road
with
the
big
garden
to
it
he
was
going
to
cut
me
more
but
i
told
him
this
was
plenty
you
should
have
seen
the
heaps
he
gave
a
woman
for
twopence
she
wanted
a
wheelbarrow
to
carry
it
away
janey
clapped
her
hands
and
began
to
dance
i
shall
help
you
to
dress
the
rooms
we
must
have
a
merry
christmas
halliburton
drew
her
to
him
yes
we
must
have
a
merry
christmas
must
we
not
janey
jane
turning
to
his
wife
can
you
manage
to
have
a
nice
dinner
for
us
christmas
only
comes
once
a
year
he
looked
up
with
his
haggard
face
very
much
as
though
he
were
longing
for
a
nice
dinner
then
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
said
jane
in
reply
smothering
down
another
sigh
i
am
going
out
presently
to
the
butcher
a
joint
of
beef
will
be
best
and
though
the
pudding
a
plain
one
i
hope
it
will
be
good
yes
we
must
keep
christmas
dawned
and
in
due
time
they
assembled
as
usual
jane
intended
to
go
to
church
that
day
during
her
husband
illness
she
had
been
obliged
to
send
the
children
alone
they
had
been
trained
to
know
what
church
meant
and
did
not
require
some
one
with
them
to
keep
them
in
order
there
a
good
thing
if
the
same
could
be
said
of
all
children
it
was
a
clear
bright
morning
cold
and
frosty
halliburton
came
down
just
as
they
were
starting
i
feel
so
much
better
he
exclaimed
i
could
almost
go
with
you
myself
jane
smiling
at
her
look
of
consternation
you
need
not
be
startled
i
do
not
intend
to
attempt
it
william
you
are
not
ready
mamma
said
i
was
to
stay
with
you
papa
stay
with
me
there
not
the
least
necessity
for
that
i
tell
you
all
i
am
feeling
better
quite
well
you
can
go
with
the
rest
william
william
looked
at
his
mother
and
for
a
moment
jane
hesitated
only
for
a
moment
i
would
rather
he
remained
edgar
she
said
betsy
will
be
gone
by
twelve
indeed
i
should
not
feel
comfortable
at
the
thought
of
your
being
alone
oh
very
well
replied
halliburton
quite
gaily
i
suppose
you
must
remain
william
or
we
shall
have
mamma
leaving
when
the
service
is
only
half
over
to
see
whether
i
have
not
fallen
into
the
fire
jane
had
all
the
household
care
upon
her
shoulders
now
and
a
great
portion
of
the
household
work
though
an
active
domestic
manager
she
had
known
nothing
practically
of
the
more
menial
work
of
a
house
she
knew
it
only
too
well
now
the
old
saying
is
a
very
true
one
necessity
makes
us
acquainted
with
strange
bedfellows
this
young
girl
betsy
who
came
in
part
of
each
day
to
assist
was
almost
as
much
trouble
as
profit
she
had
said
to
jane
on
christmas
eve
if
you
please
mother
says
i
am
to
be
at
home
if
it
convenient
i
am
however
jane
and
the
young
lady
came
to
a
compromise
she
was
to
go
home
at
twelve
and
come
back
later
to
wash
up
the
dishes
of
course
it
entailed
upon
jane
all
the
trouble
of
preparing
dinner
have
you
ever
known
one
of
these
cases
yourself
where
a
lady
a
lady
mind
you
as
jane
was
has
had
to
put
aside
her
habits
of
refinement
pin
up
her
gown
and
turn
to
and
cook
roast
the
meat
and
boil
potatoes
and
all
the
ether
essential
items
many
a
one
is
doing
it
now
in
real
life
jane
halliburton
was
not
a
solitary
example
the
pudding
had
been
made
the
day
before
and
partly
boiled
it
was
now
on
the
fire
boiling
again
and
the
rest
of
the
dinner
she
would
do
on
her
return
from
church
it
was
something
wonderful
the
improvement
in
halliburton
health
that
day
he
took
his
part
with
william
in
reading
the
psalms
and
lessons
while
the
rest
were
at
church
it
was
what
he
had
been
unable
to
do
for
a
long
time
in
consequence
of
his
cough
and
laboured
breathing
the
duty
over
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
in
thought
apparently
not
exhaustion
peace
on
earth
and
good
will
towards
men
he
repeated
presently
in
a
fervent
but
somewhat
absent
tone
william
my
boy
i
think
peace
must
be
coming
to
me
at
last
i
do
feel
so
well
what
peace
papa
asked
william
puzzled
the
peace
of
renewed
health
of
hope
freedom
from
worry
the
christmas
season
and
the
bright
day
have
taken
away
all
my
despondency
let
me
go
on
like
this
and
in
another
month
i
shall
be
out
and
at
work
william
eyes
sparkled
he
fully
believed
it
all
boys
are
sanguine
they
were
to
dine
at
three
and
jane
did
her
best
to
prepare
it
during
the
process
patience
appeared
at
the
back
door
with
a
plate
of
oranges
will
thee
accept
of
these
for
thy
children
asked
she
how
kind
you
are
exclaimed
jane
in
a
grateful
impulse
as
she
thought
of
her
children
of
such
little
treats
they
had
latterly
enjoyed
a
scanty
share
patience
i
hope
you
did
not
buy
them
purposely
had
i
had
to
buy
them
thee
would
not
have
seen
them
returned
the
candid
quakeress
a
friend
of
samuel
lynn
who
lives
at
bristol
sends
us
a
small
case
every
winter
when
i
was
unpacking
it
this
morning
i
said
to
him
young
ones
at
the
next
door
would
be
pleased
with
a
few
of
these
but
he
did
not
answer
thee
must
not
think
him
selfish
he
is
not
a
selfish
man
but
he
can
not
bear
to
see
anything
go
beside
the
child
anna
looked
at
him
eagerly
she
would
have
been
pleased
to
send
half
the
box
and
he
saw
it
in
a
few
patience
he
cried
i
am
much
obliged
to
him
and
to
you
also
repeated
jane
patience
halliburton
is
so
much
better
go
in
and
see
him
patience
went
into
the
parlour
carrying
the
oranges
with
her
when
she
came
out
again
there
was
a
grave
expression
on
her
serene
face
thee
will
do
well
not
to
count
upon
this
apparent
improvement
in
thy
husband
jane
heart
went
down
considerably
i
do
not
exactly
count
upon
it
patience
she
confessed
but
he
does
seem
to
have
changed
so
much
for
the
better
that
i
feel
in
greater
spirits
than
i
have
felt
this
many
a
day
his
cough
seems
almost
well
i
do
not
wish
to
throw
a
damp
upon
thee
still
were
i
thee
i
would
not
reckon
upon
it
these
sudden
improvements
sometimes
turn
out
to
have
been
deceitful
fare
thee
well
jane
went
into
the
parlour
the
children
were
gathered
round
the
plate
of
oranges
mamma
do
look
cried
janey
are
they
not
good
there
are
six
one
apiece
for
us
all
i
wonder
if
papa
could
eat
one
gar
you
are
not
to
touch
papa
could
you
eat
an
orange
unseen
by
the
children
halliburton
had
been
straining
his
eager
gaze
upon
the
oranges
his
mouth
parched
with
inward
fever
his
throat
dry
they
appeared
coming
thus
unexpectedly
before
him
what
the
spring
of
water
is
to
the
fainting
traveller
in
the
desert
jane
caught
the
look
and
handed
the
plate
to
him
you
would
like
one
edgar
i
am
thirsty
he
said
in
tones
savouring
of
apology
for
the
oranges
seemed
to
belong
to
the
children
rather
than
to
him
i
think
i
must
eat
mine
before
dinner
cut
it
into
four
will
you
he
took
up
one
of
the
quarters
it
is
delicious
he
exclaimed
it
is
so
refreshing
the
children
stood
around
and
watched
him
they
enjoyed
oranges
but
scarcely
with
a
zest
so
intense
as
that
when
jane
returned
to
the
kitchen
she
found
a
helpmate
the
maid
from
next
door
grace
a
young
quakeress
fair
and
demure
was
standing
there
she
had
been
sent
by
patience
to
do
what
she
could
for
half
an
hour
how
considerate
she
is
thought
grateful
jane
they
dined
in
comfort
grace
waiting
on
them
afterwards
the
oranges
were
placed
upon
the
table
master
gar
caught
up
the
plate
and
presented
it
to
his
mother
papa
has
had
his
quoth
he
not
for
me
gar
said
jane
i
do
not
eat
oranges
i
will
give
mine
to
papa
the
three
younger
children
speedily
attacked
theirs
william
did
not
he
left
his
by
the
side
of
the
one
rejected
by
his
mother
and
set
the
plate
by
halliburton
do
you
intend
these
for
me
william
yes
papa
frank
looked
surprised
william
you
do
mean
to
say
you
are
not
going
to
eat
your
orange
why
you
were
as
glad
as
any
of
us
when
they
came
i
eat
oranges
when
i
want
them
observed
william
with
an
affectation
of
carelessness
which
betrayed
a
delicacy
of
feeling
that
might
have
done
honour
to
one
older
than
he
i
have
had
too
good
a
dinner
to
care
about
oranges
halliburton
drew
william
towards
him
and
looked
steadfastly
into
his
face
with
a
meaning
smile
thank
you
my
darling
he
whispered
and
william
coloured
excessively
as
he
sat
down
halliburton
ate
the
oranges
and
appeared
as
if
he
could
have
eaten
as
many
more
then
he
leaned
his
head
back
on
the
pillow
which
was
placed
over
his
chair
and
presently
fell
asleep
be
very
still
dear
children
whispered
jane
they
looked
round
saw
why
they
were
to
be
still
and
hushed
their
busy
voices
william
pulled
a
stool
to
his
mother
feet
and
took
his
seat
on
it
holding
her
hand
between
his
papa
will
soon
be
well
again
now
he
softly
said
do
you
think
so
mamma
indeed
i
hope
he
will
she
answered
but
do
you
it
he
persisted
and
jane
detected
an
anxiety
in
his
tone
could
there
have
been
a
shadow
of
fear
upon
the
boy
own
heart
he
said
mamma
whilst
you
were
at
church
that
in
another
month
he
should
be
strong
again
not
quite
so
soon
as
that
i
fear
william
he
has
been
so
much
reduced
you
know
later
if
he
goes
on
as
well
as
he
appears
to
be
going
on
now
jane
set
the
children
to
that
renowned
game
cross
questions
and
crooked
answers
you
may
have
had
the
pleasure
of
playing
it
if
so
you
will
remember
that
it
consists
chiefly
of
whispering
it
is
difficult
to
keep
children
quiet
long
together
where
am
i
cried
a
sudden
voice
startling
the
children
in
the
midst
of
their
silent
whispers
it
came
from
halliburton
he
had
slept
about
half
an
hour
and
was
now
looking
round
in
bewilderment
his
head
starting
away
from
the
pillow
where
am
i
he
repeated
you
have
been
asleep
papa
cried
frank
asleep
oh
yes
i
remember
you
are
all
here
and
it
is
christmas
day
i
have
been
dreaming
what
about
papa
halliburton
let
his
head
fall
back
on
the
pillow
again
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
vacancy
and
there
ensued
a
silence
the
children
looked
at
him
singular
things
are
dreams
he
presently
exclaimed
i
thought
i
was
on
a
broad
wide
road
an
immense
road
and
it
was
crowded
with
people
we
were
all
going
one
way
stumbling
and
tripping
along
what
made
you
stumble
papa
interrupted
janey
whose
busy
tongue
was
ever
ready
to
talk
the
road
was
full
of
impediments
continued
halliburton
in
a
dreamy
tone
as
if
his
mental
vision
were
buried
in
the
scene
and
he
was
relating
what
had
actually
occurred
stones
and
hillocks
and
brambles
and
pools
of
shallow
water
and
long
grass
that
got
entangled
round
our
feet
nothing
but
difficulties
and
hindrances
at
the
end
in
the
horizon
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
very
very
far
away
indeed
a
hundred
times
as
far
away
as
the
malvern
hills
appear
to
be
from
us
there
shone
a
brilliant
light
so
brilliant
you
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
in
life
for
the
naked
eye
could
not
bear
such
light
and
yet
we
seemed
to
look
at
it
and
our
sight
was
not
dazzled
perhaps
it
was
fireworks
interrupted
gar
halliburton
went
on
without
heeding
him
we
were
all
pressing
on
to
get
to
the
light
though
the
distant
journey
seemed
as
if
it
could
never
end
so
long
as
we
kept
our
eyes
fixed
on
the
light
we
could
see
how
we
walked
and
we
passed
over
the
rough
places
without
fear
not
without
difficulty
but
still
we
did
pass
them
and
advanced
but
the
moment
we
took
our
eyes
from
the
light
then
we
were
stopped
some
fell
some
wandered
aside
and
would
not
try
to
go
forward
some
were
torn
by
the
brambles
some
fell
into
the
water
some
stuck
in
the
mud
in
short
they
could
not
get
on
any
way
and
yet
they
knew
at
least
it
seemed
that
they
knew
that
if
they
would
only
lift
their
eyes
to
the
light
and
keep
them
steadfastly
on
it
they
were
certain
to
be
helped
and
to
make
progress
the
few
who
did
keep
their
eyes
on
it
very
few
they
were
steadily
bore
onwards
the
same
hindrances
the
same
difficulties
were
in
their
path
so
that
at
times
they
also
felt
tempted
to
despair
to
fear
they
could
not
get
on
but
their
fears
were
groundless
so
long
as
they
did
not
take
their
eyes
from
the
light
it
guided
them
in
certainty
and
safety
over
the
rough
places
it
was
a
helper
that
could
not
fail
and
it
was
ready
to
guide
every
one
all
those
millions
and
millions
of
travellers
to
guide
them
throughout
the
whole
of
the
way
until
they
had
gained
it
the
children
had
become
interested
and
were
listening
with
hushed
lips
why
did
they
not
all
let
it
guide
them
breathlessly
asked
william
nothing
can
be
more
easy
than
to
keep
our
eyes
on
a
light
that
does
not
dazzle
what
did
you
do
papa
it
seemed
that
the
light
would
only
shine
on
one
step
at
a
time
continued
halliburton
not
in
answer
to
william
but
evidently
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
we
could
not
see
further
than
the
one
step
but
that
was
sufficient
for
the
moment
we
had
taken
it
then
the
light
shone
upon
another
and
so
we
passed
on
progressing
to
the
end
the
light
seeming
brighter
and
brighter
as
we
drew
near
to
it
did
you
get
to
it
papa
i
am
trying
to
recollect
william
i
seemed
to
be
quite
close
to
it
i
suppose
i
awoke
then
halliburton
paused
still
in
thought
but
he
said
no
more
presently
he
turned
to
his
wife
is
it
nearly
jane
i
can
not
think
what
makes
me
so
thirsty
we
can
have
tea
now
if
you
like
she
replied
i
will
go
and
see
about
it
she
left
the
room
and
janey
ran
after
her
in
the
kitchen
making
a
great
show
and
parade
of
being
at
work
amidst
plates
and
dishes
was
a
damsel
of
fifteen
her
hair
curiously
twisted
about
her
head
and
her
round
green
eyes
wide
open
it
was
betsy
that
was
good
pudding
cried
she
turning
her
face
to
halliburton
better
than
mother
she
alluded
to
a
slice
which
had
been
given
her
jane
smiled
we
want
tea
betsy
have
it
in
directly
mum
was
miss
betsy
acquiescent
response
scarcely
were
the
words
spoken
when
a
commotion
was
heard
in
the
the
door
was
flung
open
and
the
boys
called
out
the
tone
of
their
voices
one
of
utter
alarm
jane
the
child
and
the
maid
made
but
one
step
to
the
room
all
jane
fears
had
flown
to
fire
fire
had
been
almost
less
startling
halliburton
was
lying
back
on
the
pillow
with
a
ghastly
face
his
mouth
and
stained
with
blood
he
could
not
speak
but
he
asked
assistance
with
his
imploring
eyes
in
coughing
he
had
broken
a
jane
did
not
faint
did
not
scream
her
whole
heart
turned
sick
and
she
felt
that
the
end
had
come
janey
sank
down
on
the
floor
with
a
faint
cry
and
hid
her
face
on
the
sofa
one
glimpse
was
sufficient
for
betsy
the
moment
she
had
taken
it
she
subsided
into
a
succession
of
shrieks
flew
out
of
the
house
and
burst
into
that
of
lynn
there
she
terrified
the
sober
family
by
announcing
that
halliburton
was
lying
with
his
throat
cut
lynn
and
patience
hurried
in
ordering
anna
to
remain
where
she
was
they
saw
what
was
the
matter
and
placed
him
in
a
better
position
patience
helping
halliburton
to
sponge
his
face
shall
i
get
the
doctor
for
thee
friend
asked
the
quaker
of
jane
i
shall
bring
him
quicker
maybe
than
one
of
thy
lads
would
oh
yes
yes
i
warned
thee
not
to
be
sanguine
whispered
patience
when
lynn
had
gone
i
feared
it
might
be
only
the
deceitfulness
of
the
ending
the
ending
what
a
confirmation
of
jane
own
fears
she
turned
her
eyes
despairingly
on
patience
halliburton
opened
his
trembling
lips
as
though
he
would
have
spoken
patience
stopped
him
thee
must
not
talk
friend
if
thee
hast
need
of
anything
can
thee
not
make
a
sign
he
gave
them
to
understand
that
he
wanted
water
this
was
given
to
him
and
he
appeared
to
be
more
composed
there
is
nothing
else
that
i
can
do
just
now
observed
patience
i
will
go
back
and
take
thy
little
girl
with
me
see
her
hiding
there
patience
did
so
betsy
cowered
over
the
fire
in
the
kitchen
and
the
three
boys
and
their
mother
stood
round
the
dying
man
children
he
gasped
oh
edgar
do
not
speak
interrupted
jane
he
smiled
as
he
looked
at
her
very
much
as
though
he
knew
that
it
did
not
matter
whether
he
spoke
or
remained
silent
i
am
at
the
end
jane
close
to
the
light
children
he
panted
at
slow
intervals
when
i
told
you
my
dream
i
little
thought
it
was
only
a
type
of
the
present
reality
i
think
it
was
sent
to
me
that
i
might
tell
it
you
for
i
now
see
its
meaning
you
are
travelling
on
to
that
light
as
i
thought
i
was
as
i
have
been
you
will
have
the
same
to
walk
over
none
are
exempt
from
them
trials
and
temptations
and
sorrows
and
drawbacks
but
the
light
is
there
ever
shining
to
guide
you
for
it
is
heaven
will
you
always
look
up
to
it
he
gathered
their
hands
together
and
held
them
between
his
the
boys
bewildered
with
terror
and
grief
could
only
gaze
in
silence
and
listen
the
light
is
god
my
children
he
is
above
you
and
below
you
and
round
about
you
everywhere
he
is
ready
to
help
you
at
every
step
and
turn
make
him
your
guide
put
your
whole
dependence
upon
him
implicitly
trust
to
him
to
lighten
your
path
so
that
you
may
see
to
walk
in
it
he
can
not
fail
look
up
to
him
and
you
will
be
unerringly
guided
though
it
may
be
though
it
probably
will
be
only
step
by
step
never
lose
your
trust
in
god
and
then
rest
assured
he
will
conduct
you
to
his
own
bright
ending
jane
let
them
take
it
to
their
hearts
may
god
bless
you
my
dear
ones
and
bring
you
to
me
hereafter
he
ceased
and
lay
exhausted
his
eyes
fondly
seeking
jane
her
hand
clasped
in
his
jane
own
eyes
were
dry
and
burning
and
she
appeared
to
be
unnaturally
calm
gradually
the
fading
eyes
closed
in
a
very
short
time
the
knock
of
samuel
lynn
was
heard
at
the
door
he
had
brought
the
doctor
william
passing
his
handkerchief
over
his
wet
face
went
to
open
it
parry
stepped
into
the
room
and
jane
moved
from
beside
her
husband
to
give
place
to
him
he
sighed
heavily
a
minute
or
two
ago
she
whispered
the
surgeon
looked
at
him
he
bent
his
ear
to
the
open
mouth
and
then
gently
unbuttoned
the
waistcoat
and
listened
for
the
beating
of
the
heart
his
life
passed
away
in
that
sigh
murmured
the
doctor
to
jane
it
was
even
so
edgar
halliburton
had
gone
into
the
light
chapter
xv
the
funeral
jane
looked
around
her
looked
at
all
the
terrors
of
her
situation
the
first
burst
of
grief
over
and
a
day
or
two
gone
on
she
could
only
look
at
it
she
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
or
what
to
do
it
is
true
she
placed
implicit
trust
in
god
in
the
light
spoken
of
by
her
husband
when
he
was
passing
away
throughout
her
life
she
had
borne
an
lively
trust
in
god
unchanging
care
and
she
had
incessantly
striven
to
implant
the
same
trust
in
the
minds
of
her
children
but
in
this
season
of
dread
anxiety
of
hopeless
bereavement
you
will
not
think
less
well
of
her
for
hearing
that
she
did
give
way
to
despondency
almost
to
despair
from
tears
for
him
who
had
been
the
dear
partner
of
her
life
to
anxiety
for
the
future
of
his
children
from
anxiety
for
them
to
pecuniary
distress
and
embarrassment
so
passed
on
her
hours
from
christmas
night
calm
she
had
contrived
to
be
in
the
presence
of
others
but
it
was
the
calm
of
an
aching
heart
she
dreaded
her
own
reflections
when
she
rose
in
the
morning
she
said
how
shall
i
bear
up
through
the
day
and
when
she
went
to
her
bed
it
would
be
how
shall
i
drag
through
the
right
tossing
turning
moaning
walking
the
room
in
the
darkness
when
no
eye
was
upon
her
kneeling
almost
without
hope
to
pour
forth
her
tribulations
to
god
who
would
believe
that
in
the
daytime
before
others
she
could
be
so
apparently
serene
only
once
did
she
give
way
and
that
was
the
day
before
the
funeral
patience
sympathised
with
her
in
a
reasoning
sort
of
way
it
had
been
next
to
impossible
for
jane
to
keep
her
pecuniary
anxiety
from
patience
who
advised
and
assisted
her
in
making
the
various
arrangements
it
was
necessary
to
go
to
work
in
the
most
sparing
manner
possible
and
it
ended
in
jane
taking
patience
into
her
full
confidence
if
thee
can
but
keep
a
house
over
thy
head
so
as
to
retain
thy
children
with
thee
thee
wilt
get
along
do
not
be
cast
down
oh
patience
that
is
what
i
have
been
thinking
about
how
am
i
to
keep
the
house
together
i
do
not
see
that
i
can
do
it
the
furniture
is
thine
observed
patience
thee
might
let
two
or
three
of
thy
rooms
so
as
to
cover
the
rent
i
have
thought
all
that
over
and
over
again
to
myself
sighed
jane
but
patience
allowing
that
the
rent
were
made
in
that
way
how
are
we
to
live
thee
must
occupy
thy
time
in
some
way
thee
can
sew
dost
thee
know
no
only
sufficient
of
it
to
make
my
own
plain
gowns
and
jane
frocks
as
to
plain
sewing
i
could
never
earn
food
at
it
it
is
so
badly
paid
and
there
will
be
the
education
of
my
boys
and
their
clothing
thee
hast
anxiety
before
thee
i
see
it
said
patience
in
a
grave
tone
still
i
would
not
have
thee
be
cast
down
thee
will
make
thyself
ill
and
that
will
not
be
the
way
to
mend
thy
condition
jane
sat
down
her
hands
clasped
on
her
knees
her
mind
viewing
her
dark
troubles
if
i
were
but
clear
i
should
have
better
hope
she
said
lifting
her
face
in
its
sad
sorrow
patience
we
owe
half
a
rent
and
there
will
be
the
funeral
expenses
besides
hast
thee
no
kindred
that
would
aid
thee
in
thy
strait
jane
shook
her
head
the
only
kindred
she
possessed
in
the
whole
world
was
one
who
had
barely
enough
for
his
own
poor
wants
her
brother
francis
hast
thee
no
little
property
to
dispose
of
continued
patience
watches
or
things
of
that
kind
there
was
her
husband
watch
but
jane
pale
face
crimsoned
at
the
idea
of
parting
with
it
in
that
manner
it
was
a
good
watch
and
had
long
ago
been
promised
to
william
i
can
understand
thy
flush
of
aversion
said
patience
kindly
i
would
not
be
the
one
to
suggest
aught
to
hurt
thy
feelings
but
thy
necessities
may
leave
no
alternative
a
conviction
that
they
would
leave
none
was
already
stealing
over
jane
she
possessed
a
few
trinkets
herself
not
of
much
value
and
a
little
silver
all
might
have
to
go
not
excepting
the
watch
would
there
be
a
difficulty
in
disposing
of
them
patience
she
asked
aloud
none
at
all
there
is
the
said
the
quakeress
i
do
not
know
what
many
would
do
without
it
i
can
tell
thee
that
some
of
the
great
ones
of
this
city
send
their
plate
to
it
on
occasion
thee
would
not
like
to
go
to
such
a
place
thyself
but
thy
servant
mother
elizabeth
carter
is
a
discreet
woman
she
would
render
thee
this
little
service
as
i
tell
thee
if
thee
can
only
surmount
present
difficulties
so
as
to
secure
a
start
thee
may
get
on
surmount
present
difficulties
it
seemed
to
jane
next
door
to
an
impossibility
she
had
the
merest
trifle
of
money
left
was
in
debt
and
without
means
so
far
as
she
saw
of
earning
even
food
she
paid
her
last
night
visit
to
the
room
which
contained
the
coffin
and
went
thence
up
to
her
bed
to
toss
the
night
through
on
her
wet
pillow
with
a
burning
brow
and
an
aching
heart
it
was
a
sad
funeral
to
see
and
one
of
the
plainest
of
the
plain
the
clerk
of
the
church
who
had
condescended
to
come
up
to
escort
it
a
condescension
he
did
not
often
vouchsafe
to
poor
funerals
for
they
afforded
nothing
good
to
eat
and
drink
walked
first
without
a
hatband
then
came
the
coffin
covered
with
a
pall
and
william
and
frank
behind
it
jane
had
not
sent
gar
poor
little
fellow
she
thought
he
might
be
better
away
that
was
all
there
were
no
attendants
the
clerk
the
two
boys
the
coffin
and
the
men
who
bore
it
it
was
sad
to
see
the
people
stopped
to
look
as
it
went
along
the
streets
following
with
their
eyes
the
poor
fatherless
children
one
young
man
stood
aside
raised
his
hat
and
held
it
in
his
hand
until
the
coffin
had
passed
but
the
young
man
had
lived
in
foreign
countries
where
it
is
the
custom
to
remain
uncovered
whilst
a
funeral
goes
by
he
was
buried
at
martin
church
and
singular
to
say
the
officiating
minister
was
the
rev
peach
peach
did
not
know
who
he
was
interring
he
had
taken
the
service
for
martin
rector
william
heard
his
name
how
many
times
had
he
heard
his
poor
father
mention
the
name
in
connection
with
his
hopeful
prospects
he
burst
into
wailing
sobs
at
the
thought
peach
glanced
off
his
book
to
look
compassionately
at
the
sobbing
boy
the
funeral
was
over
the
last
word
of
the
service
spoken
the
first
shovel
of
earth
flung
rattling
on
to
the
coffin
the
clerk
did
not
pay
the
compliment
of
his
escort
back
again
indeed
there
was
nothing
to
escort
but
the
two
boys
they
walked
alone
with
no
company
but
their
hatbands
in
the
evening
at
dusk
they
were
gathered
together
jane
and
all
the
children
tears
seemed
to
have
a
respite
they
had
been
shed
of
late
all
too
plentifully
i
must
speak
to
you
children
said
jane
lifting
her
head
and
breaking
the
silence
i
may
as
well
speak
now
as
let
the
days
go
on
first
you
are
young
but
you
are
old
enough
to
understand
me
do
you
know
my
darlings
how
very
sad
our
position
is
in
losing
papa
said
janey
catching
her
breath
yes
yes
in
losing
him
wailed
jane
for
that
includes
more
than
you
suspect
but
i
wish
to
allude
more
particularly
to
the
future
my
dears
i
do
not
see
what
is
to
become
of
us
we
have
no
money
and
we
have
no
one
to
give
us
any
or
to
lend
us
any
no
one
in
the
wide
world
the
children
did
not
interrupt
only
william
moved
his
chair
nearer
to
hers
she
looked
so
young
in
her
widow
cap
nearly
as
young
as
when
years
ago
she
had
married
him
who
had
that
day
been
put
out
of
her
sight
for
ever
if
we
can
only
keep
a
roof
over
our
heads
continued
jane
speaking
very
softly
from
the
effort
to
subdue
her
threatening
emotion
we
may
perhaps
struggle
on
perhaps
but
it
will
be
and
you
do
not
know
half
that
the
word
implies
we
may
not
have
enough
to
eat
we
may
be
cold
and
hungry
not
once
but
constantly
and
we
shall
certainly
have
to
encounter
and
endure
the
slights
and
humiliations
attendant
on
extreme
poverty
i
do
not
know
that
we
can
retain
a
home
for
we
may
in
a
week
or
two
be
turned
from
this
but
why
be
turned
from
this
mamma
because
there
is
rent
owing
and
i
have
not
the
means
to
pay
it
she
answered
i
have
written
to
your
uncle
francis
but
i
do
not
believe
he
will
be
able
to
help
me
he
why
ca
we
go
back
to
london
to
live
eagerly
interrupted
little
gar
it
was
so
nice
there
it
was
a
better
home
than
this
you
forget
gar
that
that
here
she
almost
broke
down
and
had
to
pause
a
minute
that
our
income
there
was
earned
by
papa
he
would
not
be
there
to
earn
it
now
no
my
dear
ones
i
have
thought
the
future
over
in
every
way
thought
until
my
brain
has
become
confused
and
the
only
possible
chance
that
i
can
see
of
our
surmounting
difficulties
so
as
to
enable
us
to
exist
is
by
endeavouring
to
keep
this
home
patience
suggests
that
i
should
let
part
of
it
i
had
already
thought
of
that
and
i
shall
endeavour
to
do
so
it
may
cover
the
rent
and
taxes
and
i
must
try
and
do
something
else
that
will
find
us
food
the
children
looked
perfectly
thunderstruck
especially
the
two
elder
ones
william
and
jane
do
something
to
find
food
they
uttered
aghast
mamma
what
do
you
mean
it
is
so
difficult
to
make
children
understand
these
unhappy
things
those
who
have
been
brought
up
in
comfort
jane
sighed
and
explained
further
little
desolate
hearts
they
were
who
listened
to
her
william
she
resumed
your
poor
papa
watch
was
to
have
been
yours
but
i
scarcely
like
to
tell
you
i
fear
i
shall
be
obliged
to
dispose
of
it
to
help
our
necessities
a
spasm
shot
across
william
face
but
boy
that
he
was
he
would
not
let
his
mother
see
his
disappointment
and
looked
cheerfully
at
her
there
is
one
thought
that
weighs
more
heavily
on
my
mind
than
all
your
education
how
i
shall
manage
to
continue
it
i
do
not
know
my
darlings
i
look
upon
this
only
in
a
degree
less
essential
to
you
than
food
you
know
that
learning
is
better
than
house
and
land
i
do
not
yet
see
my
way
clear
in
any
way
it
is
very
dark
almost
as
dark
as
it
can
be
and
but
for
one
friend
i
should
despair
what
friend
is
that
mamma
do
you
mean
patience
i
mean
god
replied
jane
i
know
that
he
is
a
sure
refuge
to
those
who
trust
in
him
in
my
saddest
moments
when
i
think
how
certain
that
refuge
is
a
ray
of
light
flashes
over
me
bright
as
that
glorious
light
in
your
papa
dream
oh
my
dear
children
perhaps
we
shall
be
helped
to
struggle
on
who
will
buy
us
new
clothes
cried
frank
dropping
upon
another
phase
of
the
difficulty
jane
sighed
it
was
all
terribly
indistinct
in
all
the
tribulation
that
will
probably
come
upon
us
the
humiliations
the
necessities
we
must
strive
for
patience
to
bear
them
you
do
not
yet
understand
the
meaning
of
the
term
but
you
will
learn
it
all
too
soon
you
must
bear
not
only
for
your
own
sakes
because
it
is
your
lot
and
you
can
not
go
from
it
not
only
for
mine
but
chiefly
because
it
is
the
will
of
god
this
affliction
could
not
have
come
upon
us
unless
god
had
permitted
it
and
i
am
quite
sure
therefore
that
it
is
in
some
way
sent
for
our
good
we
shall
not
be
utterly
miserable
if
we
can
keep
together
in
our
house
you
will
aid
me
in
it
will
you
not
in
what
way
mamma
they
eagerly
asked
as
if
wishing
to
begin
something
then
what
can
we
do
you
can
aid
me
by
being
dutiful
and
obedient
by
giving
me
no
unnecessary
anxiety
or
trouble
by
cheerfully
making
the
best
of
our
privations
and
you
can
strive
to
retain
what
you
have
already
learnt
by
going
diligently
over
your
lessons
together
all
this
will
aid
and
comfort
me
william
tears
burst
forth
and
he
laid
his
head
on
his
mother
lap
oh
mamma
dear
i
will
try
and
do
for
you
all
i
can
he
sobbed
i
will
indeed
take
comfort
my
boy
she
whispered
leaning
tenderly
over
him
remember
that
your
last
act
to
your
father
was
a
loving
sacrifice
in
giving
to
him
the
orange
that
you
would
have
enjoyed
i
marked
it
william
my
darling
children
let
us
all
strive
to
bear
on
steadfastly
to
that
light
ever
looking
unto
god
chapter
xvi
trouble
a
week
elapsed
after
the
burial
of
halliburton
by
that
time
jane
had
looked
fully
into
the
best
and
worst
of
her
condition
and
had
so
to
say
organised
her
plans
by
the
disposal
of
the
watch
with
what
little
silver
they
possessed
and
ornaments
of
her
own
she
had
been
enabled
to
discharge
the
expenses
of
the
funeral
and
other
small
debts
and
to
retain
a
trifle
in
hand
for
present
wants
on
the
last
day
of
the
week
saturday
she
received
an
application
for
the
rent
a
stripling
of
some
nineteen
years
with
light
eyes
and
fair
hair
called
from
dare
to
demand
it
jane
told
him
she
could
not
pay
him
then
but
would
write
and
explain
to
dare
upon
which
the
gentleman
whose
manners
were
haughtily
condescending
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
the
house
not
deigning
to
say
good
morning
as
he
was
swinging
out
at
the
gate
patience
coming
home
from
market
with
a
basket
in
her
hand
met
him
how
dost
thee
said
she
in
salutation
but
there
was
no
response
from
the
other
except
that
his
head
went
a
shade
higher
do
you
know
who
that
is
inquired
jane
afterwards
of
a
surety
it
is
young
anthony
dare
he
has
not
pleasing
manners
not
to
us
there
is
not
a
more
arrogant
youth
in
the
town
but
his
private
character
is
not
well
spoken
of
jane
sat
down
to
write
to
dare
her
brother
francis
to
whom
she
had
explained
her
situation
had
promised
her
the
rent
for
the
due
sixteen
pounds
by
the
middle
of
february
he
could
not
let
her
have
it
before
that
period
he
said
but
she
might
positively
count
upon
it
then
she
begged
dare
to
accord
her
the
favour
of
waiting
until
then
sealing
her
note
she
sent
it
to
him
on
the
monday
following
all
was
in
readiness
to
and
jane
was
full
of
hope
looking
for
the
advent
of
lodgers
the
best
parlour
and
the
two
best
bedrooms
had
been
vacated
and
were
in
order
jane
slept
now
with
her
little
girl
and
the
boys
had
mattresses
laid
down
for
them
on
the
floor
at
the
top
of
the
house
they
were
to
make
the
study
their
from
henceforth
and
a
card
in
the
window
displayed
the
announcement
lodgings
the
more
modern
word
apartments
had
not
then
come
into
fashion
at
helstonleigh
patience
came
in
after
breakfast
with
a
piece
of
grey
merino
in
her
hand
would
thee
like
to
make
a
frock
for
anna
asked
she
of
halliburton
sarah
locke
does
them
for
her
mostly
for
it
is
work
that
i
am
not
clever
at
but
sarah
sends
me
word
she
is
too
full
of
work
this
week
to
undertake
it
i
heard
thee
say
thee
made
janey
frocks
if
thee
can
do
this
and
earn
thee
art
welcome
it
is
what
i
should
pay
sarah
jane
took
the
merino
in
thankfulness
it
was
as
a
ray
of
hope
come
to
light
up
her
heart
only
the
instant
before
patience
entered
she
was
wishing
that
something
could
arrive
for
her
to
do
never
supposing
that
it
would
arrive
and
now
it
had
come
and
would
bring
her
in
we
may
feel
inclined
to
echo
in
undisguised
contempt
for
the
trifle
ay
but
we
may
never
have
known
the
yearning
want
of
or
of
either
jane
cut
out
the
skirt
by
a
pattern
frock
and
sat
down
to
make
it
her
mind
ruminating
on
the
future
the
children
were
at
their
lessons
round
the
table
i
have
just
two
pounds
seventeen
and
sixpence
left
deliberated
jane
this
will
make
it
three
pounds
i
wonder
how
long
we
can
live
upon
that
we
have
good
clothes
and
for
the
present
the
boys
boots
are
good
if
i
can
let
the
rooms
we
shall
have
the
rent
so
that
food
is
the
chief
thing
to
look
to
we
must
spin
the
money
out
must
live
upon
bread
and
potatoes
and
a
little
milk
until
something
comes
in
i
wonder
if
five
shillings
a
week
would
pay
for
bare
food
and
for
coals
i
fear
jane
dreams
were
interrupted
the
front
gate
was
swung
open
and
two
people
men
or
gentlemen
approached
the
house
door
and
knocked
their
movements
were
so
quick
that
jane
caught
only
a
glimpse
of
them
see
who
it
is
will
you
william
she
heard
them
walk
in
and
ask
if
she
was
at
home
putting
down
her
work
she
shook
the
threads
from
her
black
dress
and
went
out
to
them
william
returning
to
his
lessons
the
visitors
were
standing
in
the
passage
one
man
and
one
shabby
one
the
former
made
a
civil
demand
for
the
rent
due
jane
replied
that
she
had
written
to
dare
on
the
previous
saturday
explaining
things
to
him
and
asking
him
to
wait
a
short
time
dare
can
not
wait
was
the
rejoinder
of
the
applicant
still
speaking
civilly
you
must
allow
me
to
remark
that
you
are
strangers
to
the
town
that
you
have
paid
no
rent
since
you
entered
the
house
we
believed
it
was
the
custom
to
pay
as
dare
did
not
apply
for
it
at
the
michaelmas
quarter
interrupted
jane
we
should
have
paid
then
had
he
asked
for
it
at
any
rate
it
is
not
paid
was
the
reply
and
i
am
sorry
to
be
under
the
necessity
of
leaving
this
man
in
possession
until
you
do
pay
they
walked
deliberately
into
the
best
parlour
and
jane
amidst
a
rushing
feeling
of
despair
that
turned
her
heart
to
sickness
knew
that
a
seizure
had
been
put
into
the
house
as
she
stood
in
her
bewilderment
patience
entered
by
the
back
door
the
way
she
always
did
enter
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
shabby
man
she
drew
jane
into
the
kitchen
what
does
that
man
do
here
she
inquired
for
answer
jane
sank
into
a
chair
and
burst
into
sobs
so
violent
as
to
surprise
the
calm
quakeress
she
turned
and
shut
the
door
hush
thee
now
hush
thee
thy
children
will
hear
and
be
terrified
art
thee
behind
with
thy
taxes
for
some
minutes
jane
could
not
reply
not
for
taxes
she
said
they
are
paid
dare
has
put
him
in
for
the
rent
patience
revolved
the
news
in
considerable
astonishment
nay
but
i
think
thee
must
be
in
error
thomas
ashley
would
not
do
such
a
thing
he
has
done
it
sobbed
jane
it
is
not
in
accordance
with
his
character
he
is
a
humane
and
considerate
man
verily
i
grieve
for
thee
that
man
is
not
an
agreeable
inmate
of
a
house
we
had
him
in
ours
last
year
you
uttered
jane
surprise
penetrating
even
to
her
own
grief
you
they
force
us
to
pay
explained
patience
we
have
a
scruple
to
do
so
believing
the
call
unjust
for
years
samuel
lynn
had
paid
the
claim
to
avert
consequences
but
last
year
he
and
many
more
friends
stood
out
against
it
the
result
was
that
that
man
now
in
thy
parlour
was
put
into
our
house
the
amount
claimed
was
one
pound
nine
shillings
and
they
took
out
of
our
house
and
sold
goods
which
had
cost
us
eleven
pounds
and
which
were
equal
to
new
oh
patience
tell
me
what
i
had
better
do
implored
jane
reverting
to
her
own
trouble
if
we
are
turned
out
and
our
things
sold
we
must
go
to
the
workhouse
we
can
not
be
in
the
streets
indeed
i
feel
incompetent
to
advise
thee
had
thee
not
better
see
anthony
dare
and
try
thy
persuasion
that
he
would
remove
the
seizure
and
wait
i
will
go
to
him
at
once
feverishly
returned
jane
you
will
allow
janey
to
remain
with
you
patience
while
i
do
so
of
a
surety
i
will
she
at
that
moment
the
children
burst
into
the
kitchen
one
after
the
other
mamma
who
is
that
man
come
into
the
study
he
has
seated
himself
right
in
front
of
the
fire
and
is
knocking
it
about
and
the
other
is
looking
at
the
tables
and
chairs
it
was
frank
who
spoke
impetuous
frank
halliburton
cast
a
despairing
look
around
her
and
patience
drew
their
attention
that
man
is
here
on
business
she
said
to
them
you
must
not
be
rude
to
him
or
he
will
be
ten
times
more
rude
to
you
the
other
will
soon
be
gone
your
mother
is
going
abroad
for
an
hour
perhaps
when
she
returns
she
will
rid
the
house
of
him
jane
child
thee
can
come
with
me
and
take
thy
dinner
with
anna
halliburton
waited
until
the
of
the
two
men
was
gone
and
then
started
it
was
a
raw
cold
day
what
some
people
call
a
black
frost
black
and
gloomy
it
all
looked
to
her
outwardly
and
inwardly
as
she
traversed
the
streets
to
the
office
of
dare
patience
had
directed
her
and
the
plate
on
the
door
dare
solicitor
showed
her
the
right
house
she
stepped
inside
that
door
which
stood
open
and
knocked
at
one
to
the
right
of
the
passage
clerks
room
was
inscribed
upon
it
come
in
three
or
four
clerks
were
in
it
in
one
of
them
she
recognized
him
who
had
just
left
her
house
the
other
clerks
appeared
to
defer
to
him
and
called
him
mr
stubbs
jane
giving
her
name
said
she
wished
to
see
dare
and
the
request
was
conveyed
to
an
inner
room
it
brought
forth
young
anthony
my
father
is
busy
and
can
not
see
you
was
his
salutation
i
can
hear
anything
you
may
have
to
say
it
will
be
the
same
thing
thank
you
replied
jane
in
courteous
tones
very
different
from
his
but
i
would
prefer
to
see
mr
dare
he
is
engaged
i
say
sharply
repeated
anthony
i
will
wait
then
i
must
see
him
anthony
dare
stalked
back
again
jane
seeing
a
bench
against
the
wall
sat
down
it
was
about
twelve
when
she
arrived
there
and
when
the
clock
struck
two
there
she
was
still
several
clients
during
that
time
had
come
and
gone
were
admitted
to
dare
but
she
sat
on
neglected
at
two
anthony
came
through
the
room
with
his
hat
on
he
appeared
to
be
going
out
what
are
you
here
still
he
exclaimed
in
genuine
or
affected
surprise
never
in
his
removing
his
hat
he
of
whom
it
was
his
delight
to
hear
it
said
that
he
was
the
most
complete
gentleman
in
helstonleigh
i
assure
you
it
is
not
of
the
least
use
your
waiting
dare
will
not
be
able
to
see
you
dare
can
surely
spare
me
a
minute
when
he
has
done
with
others
he
can
not
can
you
not
say
to
me
what
you
want
to
say
indeed
i
must
see
dare
himself
i
will
wait
on
if
you
will
allow
me
hoping
to
do
so
anthony
dare
vouchsafed
no
reply
and
went
out
one
or
two
of
the
clerks
looked
round
they
appeared
not
to
understand
why
she
sat
on
so
persistently
or
why
dare
refused
to
see
her
in
about
an
hour
time
the
inner
door
opened
a
tall
man
with
a
bold
free
countenance
looked
into
the
room
supposing
it
to
be
dare
jane
rose
and
approached
him
will
you
allow
me
a
few
conversation
she
asked
i
presume
you
are
mr
dare
he
put
up
his
hands
as
if
to
fence
her
off
i
have
no
time
i
have
no
time
he
reiterated
and
shut
the
door
in
her
face
jane
sat
down
again
on
the
bench
stubbs
i
want
you
came
forth
from
dare
voice
as
he
opened
the
door
an
inch
to
speak
it
stubbs
went
in
remained
a
few
minutes
and
then
returned
put
on
his
hat
and
walked
out
his
departure
was
the
signal
for
considerable
relaxation
in
the
office
duties
when
the
cat
away
you
know
the
rest
yawning
stretching
whispering
and
laughing
supervened
one
of
the
clerks
took
from
his
pocket
a
paper
of
the
biscuits
called
union
in
helstonleigh
and
began
eating
them
another
pulled
out
a
bottle
and
solaced
himself
with
some
of
its
contents
whatever
they
might
be
suddenly
the
man
with
the
biscuits
got
off
his
stool
and
offered
them
to
halliburton
her
pale
sad
face
may
have
prompted
his
good
nature
to
the
act
you
have
waited
a
good
while
and
perhaps
have
lost
your
dinner
through
it
he
said
jane
took
one
of
them
you
are
very
kind
thank
you
she
faintly
said
but
not
a
crumb
of
it
could
she
swallow
she
had
taken
a
slice
of
dry
toast
for
her
breakfast
that
morning
with
half
a
cup
of
milk
and
it
was
long
since
she
had
had
a
sufficiency
of
food
at
any
meal
she
felt
weak
sick
faint
but
anxiety
and
suspense
were
at
work
within
parching
her
throat
destroying
her
appetite
she
held
the
biscuit
in
her
fingers
resting
on
her
lap
and
in
spite
of
her
efforts
the
rebellious
tears
forced
themselves
to
her
eyes
raising
her
hand
she
quietly
let
fall
her
widow
veil
a
man
came
in
and
counted
out
eight
shillings
laying
them
upon
the
desk
i
could
make
up
the
other
two
this
week
i
could
indeed
he
said
with
trembling
eagerness
i
bring
twelve
next
week
please
to
say
mind
you
do
responded
one
of
the
clerks
or
you
know
what
will
be
in
store
for
you
the
man
shook
his
head
he
probably
did
know
and
in
going
out
was
nearly
knocked
over
by
a
handsome
lad
of
seventeen
who
was
running
in
very
handsome
were
his
features
but
they
were
marred
by
the
free
expression
which
characterized
dare
i
say
is
the
governor
in
cried
he
out
of
breath
yes
sir
lord
hawkesley
with
him
the
deuce
take
lord
hawkesley
then
returned
the
young
gentleman
where
stubbs
i
want
my
week
money
and
i
ca
wait
walker
i
say
where
stubbs
stubbs
is
gone
out
sir
what
a
bother
halloa
here
some
money
what
is
this
continued
the
speaker
catching
up
the
eight
shillings
it
is
some
that
has
just
been
paid
in
master
herbert
that
all
right
then
said
he
slipping
five
of
them
into
his
jacket
pocket
tell
stubbs
to
put
it
down
as
my
week
money
he
tore
off
jane
sat
on
wondering
what
she
was
to
do
there
appeared
to
be
little
probability
that
she
would
be
admitted
to
dare
and
yet
how
could
she
go
home
as
she
came
hopeless
to
the
presence
of
that
man
no
she
must
wait
still
wait
until
the
last
she
might
catch
a
word
with
dare
as
he
was
leaving
jane
could
not
help
thinking
his
behaviour
very
bad
in
refusing
to
see
her
the
office
was
being
lighted
when
stubbs
returned
one
of
the
clerks
pointed
to
the
three
shillings
with
his
pen
kinnersley
has
brought
eight
shillings
he
will
make
it
twelve
next
week
could
manage
the
ten
this
he
says
where
are
the
eight
shillings
asked
stubbs
i
see
only
three
oh
master
herbert
came
in
and
took
off
five
he
said
you
were
to
put
it
down
as
his
week
money
he
take
a
little
too
much
some
day
if
he
not
checked
was
the
cynical
reply
of
the
senior
clerk
however
it
no
business
of
mine
he
put
the
three
shillings
into
his
own
desk
and
made
an
entry
in
a
book
after
that
he
went
in
to
dare
who
was
now
alone
a
large
room
handsomely
fitted
up
dare
table
was
near
one
of
the
windows
a
desk
at
which
anthony
sometimes
sat
was
at
the
other
dare
looked
up
i
could
not
do
anything
sir
said
stubbs
the
other
party
will
listen
to
no
proposal
at
all
they
say
they
throw
it
into
chancery
first
an
awful
rage
they
are
in
tush
said
dare
chancery
indeed
they
tell
another
tale
in
a
day
or
two
has
kinnersley
been
in
kinnersley
has
brought
eight
shillings
and
promises
to
bring
twelve
next
monday
master
herbert
carried
off
five
of
them
and
left
word
it
was
for
his
week
money
a
smart
blade
cried
dare
apostrophizing
his
son
with
personal
pride
it
when
i
can
is
his
motto
he
make
a
good
lawyer
stubbs
very
good
acquiesced
stubbs
is
that
woman
gone
yet
no
sir
my
opinion
is
she
means
to
wait
until
she
sees
you
then
send
her
in
at
once
and
let
get
it
over
thundered
dare
in
what
lay
his
objection
to
seeing
her
a
dread
lest
she
should
put
forth
their
relationship
as
a
plea
for
his
clemency
if
so
he
was
destined
to
be
agreeably
disappointed
jane
did
not
allude
to
it
would
not
allude
to
it
after
that
interview
held
with
dare
some
three
or
four
months
before
she
had
dropped
all
remembrance
of
the
connection
even
the
children
did
not
know
of
it
she
only
solicited
dare
leniency
now
as
any
other
stranger
might
have
solicited
it
little
chance
was
there
of
dare
acceding
to
her
prayer
he
and
his
wife
both
wanted
helstonleigh
to
be
free
of
the
halliburtons
it
will
be
utter
ruin
she
urged
it
will
turn
us
beggars
into
the
streets
dare
i
you
the
rent
by
the
middle
of
february
unless
it
were
certain
my
brother
would
not
have
promised
it
to
me
surely
you
may
accord
me
this
short
time
i
can
not
that
is
ashley
can
not
it
was
a
reprehensible
piece
of
carelessness
on
my
part
to
suffer
the
rent
to
go
on
for
half
a
year
considering
that
you
were
strangers
ashley
will
look
to
me
to
see
him
well
out
of
it
there
is
sufficient
furniture
in
my
house
new
furniture
to
pay
what
is
owing
three
times
over
may
be
as
it
stands
in
it
things
worth
forty
pounds
in
a
house
fetch
ten
at
a
sale
that
is
an
additional
reason
why
i
now
my
good
lady
interrupted
dare
with
imperative
civility
one
word
is
as
good
as
a
thousand
and
that
word
i
have
said
i
can
not
withdraw
the
seizure
except
on
receipt
of
the
rent
and
costs
pay
them
and
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
do
it
if
you
stop
here
all
night
i
can
give
you
no
other
answer
and
my
time
is
valuable
he
glanced
at
the
door
as
he
spoke
jane
took
the
hint
and
passed
out
of
it
as
much
by
the
tone
as
by
the
words
she
gathered
that
there
was
no
hope
whatever
the
streets
were
bright
with
gas
as
she
hurried
along
her
head
bent
her
veil
over
her
face
her
tears
falling
silently
but
when
she
left
the
town
behind
her
and
approached
a
lonely
part
of
the
road
where
no
eye
was
on
her
no
ear
near
her
then
the
sobs
burst
forth
uncontrolled
no
eye
on
her
no
ear
near
her
ay
but
there
was
there
was
one
eye
one
ear
which
never
closes
and
as
jane
dreadful
trouble
resolved
itself
into
a
cry
for
help
to
him
who
ever
listens
there
seemed
to
come
a
feeling
of
peace
of
into
her
soul
chapter
xvii
thomas
ashley
frank
met
her
as
she
went
in
it
was
dark
but
she
kept
her
veil
down
oh
mamma
that
the
most
horrible
man
he
began
in
a
whisper
you
know
the
cheese
you
brought
in
on
saturday
that
we
might
not
eat
our
bread
quite
dry
well
he
has
eaten
it
up
every
morsel
and
half
a
loaf
of
bread
and
he
has
burnt
the
whole
scuttleful
of
coal
and
he
swore
because
there
was
no
meat
and
he
swore
at
us
because
we
would
not
go
to
the
and
buy
him
some
beer
he
said
we
were
to
buy
it
and
pay
for
it
i
said
you
would
not
allow
us
to
go
mamma
interrupted
william
who
now
came
up
i
told
him
that
if
he
wanted
beer
he
must
go
and
get
it
for
himself
i
spoke
civilly
you
know
not
rudely
he
went
into
such
a
passion
and
said
such
things
it
is
a
good
thing
jane
was
out
where
is
gar
she
asked
gar
was
frightened
at
the
man
and
the
made
him
sick
and
he
cried
and
then
he
lay
down
on
the
floor
and
went
to
sleep
felt
sick
she
drew
her
two
boys
into
the
parlour
dark
there
except
for
the
lamp
in
the
road
which
shone
in
pressing
them
in
her
arms
completely
subdued
by
the
miseries
of
her
situation
she
leaned
her
forehead
upon
william
shoulder
and
burst
once
more
into
a
most
distressing
flood
of
tears
they
were
alarmed
they
cried
with
her
oh
mamma
what
is
it
why
do
you
order
the
man
to
go
away
my
boys
i
must
tell
you
i
can
not
keep
it
from
you
she
sobbed
that
man
is
put
here
to
remain
until
i
can
pay
the
rent
if
i
can
not
pay
it
our
things
will
be
taken
and
sold
william
pulses
and
heart
alike
beat
but
he
was
silent
frank
spoke
whatever
shall
we
do
mamma
i
do
not
know
she
wailed
perhaps
god
will
help
us
there
is
no
one
else
to
do
it
patience
came
in
for
about
the
sixth
time
to
see
whether
jane
had
returned
and
how
the
mission
had
sped
they
called
her
into
the
cold
dark
room
jane
gave
her
the
history
of
the
whole
day
and
patience
listened
in
astonishment
i
can
not
but
believe
that
thomas
ashley
must
have
been
said
she
presently
but
that
you
are
strangers
in
the
place
i
should
say
you
had
an
enemy
who
may
have
gone
to
him
with
a
tale
that
thee
can
pay
but
will
not
still
even
in
that
case
it
would
be
unlike
thomas
ashley
he
is
a
kind
and
a
good
man
not
a
harsh
one
dare
told
me
he
was
expressly
acting
for
mr
ashley
well
i
say
that
i
can
not
understand
it
repeated
patience
it
is
not
like
thomas
ashley
i
will
give
thee
an
instance
of
his
disposition
and
general
character
there
was
a
baker
rented
under
him
living
in
a
house
of
thomas
ashley
the
baker
got
behind
with
his
rent
other
bakers
were
more
favoured
than
he
but
he
kept
on
at
his
trade
hoping
times
would
mend
year
by
year
he
failed
in
his
rent
thomas
ashley
mark
thee
still
paying
him
regularly
for
the
bread
supplied
to
his
family
do
you
not
stop
his
asked
one
who
knew
of
this
of
thomas
ashley
he
is
poor
and
looks
to
my
weekly
money
with
that
of
others
to
buy
his
flour
was
thomas
ashley
answer
well
when
he
owed
several
years
rent
the
baker
died
and
the
widow
was
going
to
move
anthony
dare
hastened
to
thomas
ashley
day
shall
i
levy
a
distress
upon
the
goods
asked
he
at
all
replied
thomas
ashley
and
he
went
to
the
widow
and
told
her
the
rent
was
forgiven
and
the
goods
were
her
own
to
take
with
her
when
she
left
that
is
thomas
ashley
jane
bent
her
head
in
thought
is
lynn
at
home
she
asked
i
should
like
to
speak
to
him
he
has
had
his
tea
and
gone
back
to
the
manufactory
but
he
will
be
home
soon
after
eight
i
will
keep
jane
till
bedtime
she
and
anna
are
happy
over
their
puzzles
patience
am
i
obliged
to
find
that
man
in
food
that
thee
art
it
is
the
law
the
noise
made
by
patience
in
going
away
brought
the
man
forth
from
the
study
a
candle
in
his
hand
when
is
that
mother
of
yours
coming
back
he
roared
out
to
the
boys
jane
advanced
oh
you
are
here
he
uttered
wrathfully
what
are
you
going
to
give
me
to
eat
and
drink
a
pretty
thing
this
is
to
have
an
officer
in
and
starve
him
you
shall
have
tea
directly
you
shall
have
what
we
have
she
answered
in
a
low
tone
the
kettle
was
boiling
on
the
study
fire
jane
lighted
a
fire
in
the
parlour
and
sent
frank
out
for
butter
the
man
smoked
over
the
study
fire
as
he
had
done
all
the
afternoon
and
gar
slept
beside
him
on
the
floor
but
william
went
now
and
brought
the
child
away
jane
sent
the
man
his
tea
in
and
the
loaf
and
butter
the
fare
did
not
please
him
he
came
to
the
parlour
and
said
he
must
have
meat
he
had
had
none
for
his
dinner
i
can
not
give
it
you
replied
jane
we
are
eating
dry
toast
and
bread
as
you
may
see
i
sent
butter
to
you
he
stood
there
for
some
minutes
giving
vent
to
his
feelings
in
rather
strong
language
and
then
he
went
back
to
revenge
himself
upon
the
butter
for
the
want
of
meat
jane
laid
her
hand
upon
her
beating
throat
beating
with
its
tribulation
between
eight
and
nine
jane
went
to
the
next
door
samuel
lynn
had
come
home
for
the
evening
and
was
sitting
at
the
table
in
his
parlour
helping
the
two
little
girls
with
a
geographical
puzzle
which
had
baffled
their
skill
he
was
a
little
man
quiet
in
movement
pale
and
sedate
in
feature
dry
and
unsympathising
in
manner
thee
art
in
trouble
friend
i
hear
he
said
placing
a
chair
for
jane
whilst
patience
came
and
called
the
children
away
it
is
sad
for
thee
in
great
trouble
answered
jane
i
came
in
to
ask
if
you
would
serve
me
in
my
trouble
i
fancy
perhaps
you
can
do
so
if
you
will
in
what
way
friend
would
you
interest
yourself
for
me
with
ashley
he
might
listen
to
you
were
he
assured
that
the
money
would
be
forthcoming
in
february
i
think
he
might
agree
to
give
me
time
friend
i
can
not
do
this
was
the
reply
of
the
quaker
my
relations
with
thomas
ashley
are
confined
to
business
matters
and
i
can
not
overstep
them
to
interfere
with
his
private
affairs
would
not
be
seemly
neither
might
he
deem
it
so
i
am
but
his
servant
remember
the
words
fell
upon
her
heart
as
ice
she
believed
it
her
only
chance
some
one
interceding
for
her
with
ashley
she
said
so
why
not
go
to
him
thyself
friend
would
he
hear
me
hastily
asked
jane
i
am
a
stranger
to
him
thee
art
his
tenant
as
to
hearing
thee
that
he
certainly
would
thomas
ashley
is
of
a
courteous
nature
the
poorest
workman
in
our
manufactory
going
to
the
master
with
a
grievance
is
sure
of
a
patient
hearing
but
if
thee
ask
me
would
he
grant
thy
petition
there
i
can
not
inform
thee
patience
opines
that
thee
or
thy
intentions
may
have
been
falsely
represented
to
him
i
never
knew
him
resort
to
harsh
measures
before
when
would
be
the
best
time
to
see
him
is
it
too
late
would
not
be
a
likely
time
friend
to
trouble
him
he
has
not
long
returned
from
a
day
journey
and
is
no
doubt
cold
and
tired
i
met
james
meeking
driving
down
as
i
came
home
he
had
left
the
master
at
his
house
they
have
been
out
on
business
connected
with
the
manufactory
thee
might
see
him
in
the
morning
at
his
breakfast
hour
jane
rose
and
thanked
the
quaker
i
will
certainly
go
she
said
there
is
no
need
to
say
to
him
that
i
suggested
it
to
thee
friend
go
as
of
thy
own
accord
jane
went
home
with
her
little
girl
their
undesirable
visitor
looked
out
at
the
study
door
and
began
a
battle
about
supper
it
ought
to
comprise
in
his
opinion
meat
and
beer
he
that
one
of
the
boys
should
go
out
for
beer
jane
steadily
refused
she
was
tempted
to
tell
him
that
the
children
of
a
gentleman
were
not
despatched
to
on
such
errands
she
offered
him
the
money
to
go
and
get
some
for
himself
it
aroused
his
anger
he
accused
her
of
wanting
to
get
him
out
of
the
house
by
stratagem
that
she
might
lock
him
out
and
he
flung
the
pence
back
amongst
them
janey
screamed
and
gar
burst
out
crying
as
patience
had
said
he
was
not
a
pleasant
inmate
jane
ran
upstairs
and
the
children
followed
her
where
is
he
to
sleep
inquired
william
it
is
a
positive
fact
that
until
that
moment
jane
had
forgotten
all
about
the
sleeping
of
course
he
must
sleep
there
though
she
had
not
thought
of
it
amidst
the
poor
in
her
father
parish
in
london
jane
had
seen
many
phases
of
distress
but
with
this
particular
annoyance
she
had
never
been
brought
into
contact
however
it
had
to
be
done
what
a
night
that
was
for
her
she
paced
her
room
nearly
throughout
it
with
quiet
movement
janey
sleeping
placidly
now
giving
way
to
all
the
dark
appearances
of
her
position
to
uncontrollable
despondency
now
kneeling
and
crying
for
help
in
her
heartfelt
anguish
morning
came
the
black
frost
had
gone
and
the
sun
shone
after
breakfast
jane
put
on
her
shawl
and
bonnet
ashley
residence
was
very
near
to
them
only
a
little
higher
up
the
road
it
was
a
large
house
almost
a
mansion
surrounded
by
a
beautiful
garden
jane
had
passed
it
two
or
three
times
and
thought
what
a
nice
place
it
was
she
repeatedly
saw
ashley
walk
past
her
house
as
he
went
to
or
came
from
the
manufactory
she
was
not
a
bad
reader
of
countenances
and
she
judged
him
to
be
a
thorough
gentleman
his
face
was
a
refined
one
his
manner
pleasant
she
found
that
she
had
gone
at
an
untoward
time
standing
before
the
hall
door
was
ashley
open
carriage
the
groom
standing
at
the
horse
head
even
as
jane
ascended
the
steps
the
door
opened
and
and
ashley
were
coming
forth
feeling
terribly
distressed
and
disappointed
she
scarcely
defined
why
jane
accosted
the
former
and
requested
a
few
minutes
interview
ashley
looked
at
her
a
fair
young
widow
evidently
a
lady
he
did
not
recognise
her
he
had
seen
her
before
but
she
was
in
a
different
style
of
dress
now
ashley
raised
his
hat
as
he
replied
to
her
is
your
business
with
me
pressing
i
was
just
going
out
indeed
it
is
pressing
she
said
or
i
would
not
think
of
asking
to
detain
you
then
walk
in
he
returned
a
little
delay
will
not
make
much
difference
opening
the
door
of
a
small
apparently
his
own
he
invited
her
to
a
seat
near
the
fire
as
she
took
it
jane
untied
the
crape
strings
of
her
bonnet
and
threw
back
her
heavy
veil
she
was
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
felt
choking
i
fear
you
are
ill
ashley
remarked
can
i
get
you
anything
i
shall
be
better
in
a
minute
thank
you
she
panted
perhaps
you
do
not
know
me
sir
i
live
in
your
house
a
little
lower
down
i
am
mrs
halliburton
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
i
did
not
remember
you
at
first
i
have
seen
you
in
passing
his
manner
was
perfectly
kind
and
open
not
in
the
least
like
that
of
a
landlord
who
had
just
put
a
distress
into
his
tenant
house
i
have
come
here
to
beseech
your
mercy
she
began
in
agitation
i
have
not
the
rent
now
but
if
you
will
consent
to
wait
until
the
middle
of
february
it
will
be
ready
oh
ashley
do
not
oppress
me
for
it
think
of
my
situation
i
never
oppressed
any
one
in
my
life
was
the
quiet
rejoinder
of
ashley
spoken
however
in
a
somewhat
surprised
tone
sir
it
is
oppression
i
beg
your
pardon
for
saying
so
i
promise
that
the
rent
shall
be
paid
to
you
in
a
few
weeks
to
force
my
furniture
from
me
now
is
oppression
i
do
not
understand
you
returned
ashley
to
sell
my
furniture
under
the
distress
will
be
utter
ruin
to
me
and
my
children
she
continued
we
have
no
resource
no
home
we
shall
have
to
lie
in
the
streets
or
die
oh
sir
do
not
take
it
but
you
are
agitating
yourself
unnecessarily
halliburton
i
have
no
intention
of
taking
your
furniture
no
intention
sir
she
echoed
you
have
put
in
a
distress
put
in
a
what
cried
he
in
unbounded
surprise
a
distress
the
man
has
been
in
since
yesterday
morning
ashley
looked
at
her
a
few
moments
in
silence
did
the
man
tell
you
where
he
came
from
it
was
dare
who
put
him
in
acting
for
you
i
went
to
dare
and
he
kept
me
waiting
nearly
five
hours
in
his
outer
office
before
he
would
see
me
when
he
did
see
me
he
declined
to
hear
me
all
he
would
say
was
that
i
must
pay
the
rent
or
he
should
take
the
furniture
acting
for
mr
ashley
a
strangely
severe
expression
darkened
ashley
face
first
of
all
my
dear
lady
let
me
assure
you
that
i
knew
nothing
of
this
or
it
should
never
have
been
done
i
am
surprised
at
mr
dare
could
she
fail
to
trust
that
open
countenance
that
benevolent
eye
her
hopes
rose
high
within
her
sir
will
you
withdraw
the
man
and
give
me
time
i
will
the
revulsion
of
feeling
from
despair
and
grief
was
too
great
she
burst
into
tears
having
struggled
against
them
in
vain
ashley
rose
and
looked
from
the
window
and
presently
she
grew
calmer
when
he
sat
down
again
she
gave
him
the
outline
of
her
situation
of
her
present
dilemma
of
her
hopes
poor
hopes
that
they
were
of
getting
a
scanty
living
through
letting
her
rooms
and
doing
some
sewing
or
by
other
employment
were
i
to
lose
my
furniture
it
would
take
from
me
this
only
chance
she
concluded
you
shall
not
lose
it
through
me
warmly
spoke
ashley
the
man
shall
be
dismissed
from
your
house
in
half
an
hour
time
oh
thank
you
thank
you
she
breathed
rising
to
leave
i
have
not
been
able
to
supply
him
with
great
things
in
the
shape
of
food
and
he
uses
very
bad
language
in
the
hearing
of
my
children
thank
you
mr
ashley
he
shook
hands
with
her
cordially
and
attended
her
to
the
hall
door
ashley
a
pretty
woman
somewhat
stately
in
general
stood
there
still
well
wrapped
in
velvet
and
furs
she
did
not
care
to
return
to
the
warm
rooms
jane
said
a
few
words
of
apology
for
detaining
her
and
passed
on
ashley
turned
back
to
his
room
drew
his
desk
towards
him
and
began
to
write
his
wife
followed
him
who
was
that
thomas
halliburton
our
widowed
tenant
next
door
to
samuel
lynn
you
remember
i
told
you
of
meeting
the
funeral
two
little
boys
were
following
alone
oh
poor
little
things
yes
what
did
she
want
ashley
made
no
reply
he
was
writing
rapidly
the
note
when
finished
was
sealed
and
directed
to
dare
he
then
helped
his
wife
into
the
carriage
took
the
reins
and
sat
down
beside
her
the
groom
took
his
place
in
the
seat
behind
and
ashley
drove
round
the
gravel
drive
out
at
the
gate
and
turned
towards
helstonleigh
thomas
you
are
going
the
wrong
way
said
ashley
in
consternation
what
are
you
thinking
of
i
shall
turn
directly
he
answered
there
was
a
severe
look
upon
his
face
and
he
drove
very
fast
by
which
signs
ashley
knew
something
had
put
him
out
she
inquired
and
he
gave
her
the
outline
of
what
he
had
just
heard
how
could
anthony
dare
act
so
involuntarily
exclaimed
ashley
i
do
know
i
shall
give
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
more
plainly
than
he
will
like
this
is
not
the
first
time
he
has
attempted
a
rascally
action
under
cover
of
my
name
shall
you
lose
the
rent
i
think
not
margaret
she
said
not
and
she
carries
sincerity
in
her
face
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
lose
it
if
she
can
help
it
if
i
do
i
must
that
all
i
never
yet
added
to
the
trouble
of
those
in
distress
and
i
never
will
he
pulled
up
at
halliburton
house
which
she
had
just
reached
also
the
groom
came
to
the
horse
and
ashley
entered
the
man
was
comfortably
stretched
before
the
study
fire
smoking
his
short
pipe
up
he
jumped
when
he
saw
ashley
and
smuggled
his
pipe
into
his
pocket
his
offensive
manner
had
changed
to
humble
servility
do
you
know
me
shortly
inquired
ashley
the
man
pulled
his
hair
in
token
of
respect
certainly
sir
mr
ashley
very
well
carry
this
note
to
mr
dare
the
man
received
the
note
in
his
hand
and
held
it
there
apparently
in
some
perplexity
may
i
leave
sir
without
the
authority
of
mr
dare
i
thought
you
said
you
knew
me
was
ashley
reply
haughty
displeasure
in
his
tone
i
beg
pardon
sir
replied
the
man
pulling
his
hair
again
and
making
a
movement
of
departure
i
suppose
i
bai
back
sir
you
are
not
he
took
up
a
small
bundle
tied
in
a
blue
handkerchief
which
he
had
brought
with
him
and
appeared
excessively
careful
of
caught
at
his
battered
hat
ducked
his
head
to
ashley
and
left
the
house
the
note
held
between
his
fingers
would
you
like
to
see
what
it
contained
dear
sir
i
find
that
you
have
levied
a
distress
on
halliburton
goods
for
rent
due
to
me
that
you
should
have
done
so
without
my
authority
astonishes
me
much
that
you
should
have
done
so
at
all
knowing
what
you
do
of
my
principles
astonishes
me
more
i
send
the
man
back
to
you
the
costs
of
this
procedure
you
will
either
set
down
to
me
or
pay
out
of
your
own
pocket
whichever
you
may
deem
the
more
just
but
you
will
charge
them
to
halliburton
have
the
goodness
to
call
upon
me
morning
in
east
street
thomas
ashley
he
will
not
trouble
you
again
halliburton
observed
ashley
with
a
pleasant
smile
as
he
went
out
to
his
carriage
jane
stood
at
her
window
she
watched
the
man
go
towards
helstonleigh
with
the
note
she
watched
ashley
step
into
his
seat
turn
his
horse
and
drive
up
the
road
but
all
things
were
looking
misty
to
her
for
her
eyes
were
dim
god
did
hear
me
was
her
earnest
thought
chapter
xviii
honey
fair
helstonleigh
abounded
with
glove
manufactories
it
was
a
trade
that
might
be
said
to
be
a
blessing
to
the
localities
where
it
was
carried
on
since
it
was
one
of
the
very
few
employments
that
furnished
to
the
poor
female
population
easy
clean
and
profitable
work
their
own
the
evils
arising
to
women
who
go
out
to
work
in
factories
have
been
rehearsed
over
and
over
again
and
the
chief
evil
we
will
put
others
out
of
sight
is
that
it
takes
the
married
woman
from
her
home
and
her
family
her
young
children
drag
themselves
up
in
her
absence
for
worse
or
for
better
alone
they
must
do
it
for
she
has
to
be
away
toiling
for
daily
bread
there
is
no
home
privacy
no
home
comfort
no
home
happiness
the
factory
is
their
life
and
other
interests
give
way
to
it
but
with
the
case
was
different
whilst
the
husbands
were
at
the
manufactories
pursuing
their
day
work
the
wives
and
elder
daughters
were
earning
money
easily
and
pleasantly
at
home
the
work
was
clean
and
profitable
all
that
was
necessary
for
its
accomplishment
being
common
skill
as
a
seamstress
not
five
minutes
walk
from
halliburton
house
and
nearer
to
helstonleigh
a
turning
out
of
the
main
road
led
you
to
quite
a
colony
of
workwomen
gloveresses
as
they
were
termed
in
the
local
phraseology
it
was
a
long
wide
lane
the
houses
some
larger
some
smaller
built
on
either
side
of
it
a
road
quite
wide
enough
for
health
if
the
inhabitants
had
only
kept
it
as
it
ought
to
have
been
kept
but
they
did
not
do
so
the
highway
was
made
a
common
receptacle
for
refuse
it
was
so
much
easier
to
open
the
kitchen
door
most
of
the
houses
were
entered
at
once
by
the
kitchen
and
to
chuck
things
out
rather
than
be
at
the
trouble
of
conveying
them
to
the
proper
receptacle
the
at
the
back
occasionally
a
solitary
policeman
would
come
picking
his
way
through
the
dirt
and
dust
and
order
it
to
be
removed
upon
which
some
slight
improvement
would
be
visible
for
a
day
or
two
the
name
of
this
charming
place
was
honey
fair
though
in
truth
it
was
redolent
of
nothing
so
pleasant
as
honey
of
the
occupants
of
these
houses
the
husbands
and
elder
sons
were
all
glove
operatives
several
of
them
in
the
manufactory
of
ashley
the
wives
sewed
the
gloves
at
home
many
a
similar
colony
to
honey
fair
was
there
in
helstonleigh
but
in
hearing
of
one
you
hear
of
all
the
trade
was
extensively
pursued
a
very
few
of
the
manufactories
were
of
the
extent
that
was
ashley
and
they
gradually
descended
in
size
until
some
comprised
not
half
a
score
workmen
all
told
but
whose
masters
alike
dignified
themselves
by
the
title
of
manufacturer
there
flourished
a
shop
in
the
general
line
in
honey
fair
kept
by
a
buffle
a
great
gossip
her
husband
a
steady
little
man
mincing
in
his
speech
and
gait
scrupulously
neat
and
clean
in
his
attire
and
thence
called
the
dandy
was
chief
workman
at
one
of
the
smallest
of
the
establishments
he
had
three
men
and
two
boys
under
him
and
so
he
styled
himself
the
foreman
no
one
knew
half
so
much
of
the
affairs
of
their
neighbours
as
did
buffle
no
one
could
tell
of
the
and
shortcomings
of
honey
fair
as
she
could
many
a
gloveress
girl
running
in
at
dusk
for
a
halfpenny
candle
did
not
receive
it
until
she
had
first
submitted
to
a
lecture
from
buffle
not
that
her
custom
was
all
of
this
ignoble
description
some
of
the
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
would
deal
with
her
in
a
chance
way
when
out
of
articles
at
home
her
wares
were
good
her
bacon
was
particularly
good
amidst
other
olfactory
treats
indigenous
to
honey
fair
was
that
of
pigs
and
kept
by
buffle
occasionally
halliburton
would
go
to
this
shop
it
was
nearer
to
her
house
than
any
other
and
in
her
small
way
had
been
extensively
patronised
by
her
of
all
her
customers
halliburton
was
the
one
who
most
puzzled
buffle
in
the
first
place
she
never
gossiped
in
the
second
though
evidently
a
lady
she
would
carry
her
purchases
home
herself
the
very
servants
from
the
very
large
houses
coming
flaunting
in
their
smart
caps
would
loftily
order
their
pound
of
bacon
or
shillingsworth
of
eggs
sent
home
for
them
halliburton
took
hers
away
in
her
own
hand
and
this
puzzled
buffle
but
her
pays
ready
money
observed
that
lady
when
relating
this
to
another
customer
so
my
place
to
grumble
during
the
summer
weather
whenever
jane
had
occasion
to
walk
through
honey
fair
on
her
way
to
this
shop
she
would
linger
to
admire
the
women
at
their
open
doors
and
windows
busy
over
their
nice
clean
work
rocking
the
cradle
with
one
foot
or
jogging
the
baby
on
their
knees
to
a
tune
of
their
own
composing
their
hands
would
be
ever
active
at
their
employment
some
made
the
gloves
that
is
seamed
the
fingers
together
and
put
in
the
thumbs
and
these
were
called
makers
some
welted
or
hemmed
the
gloves
round
at
the
edge
of
the
wrist
these
were
called
welters
some
worked
the
three
ornamental
lines
on
the
back
and
these
were
called
pointers
some
of
the
work
was
done
in
what
was
called
a
patent
machine
whereby
the
stitches
were
rendered
perfectly
equal
and
some
of
the
stouter
gloves
were
stitched
together
instead
of
being
sewn
stitching
so
beautifully
regular
and
neat
that
a
stranger
would
look
at
it
in
admiration
in
short
there
were
different
branches
in
the
making
and
sewing
of
gloves
as
there
are
in
most
trades
it
now
struck
jane
that
she
might
find
employment
at
this
work
until
better
times
should
come
round
true
she
had
never
worked
at
it
but
she
was
expert
with
her
needle
and
it
was
easily
acquired
she
possessed
a
dry
cool
hand
too
a
great
thing
where
sometimes
floss
silk
has
to
be
used
what
cared
she
for
lowering
herself
to
the
employment
only
dealt
out
to
the
poor
was
she
not
poor
herself
and
who
knew
her
in
helstonleigh
the
day
that
ashley
removed
the
dreaded
visitor
from
her
house
jane
had
occasion
to
speak
to
elizabeth
carter
her
young
servant
mother
at
dusk
putting
aside
the
frock
she
was
making
for
anna
jane
proceeded
to
honey
fair
in
which
perfumed
locality
carter
lived
an
agreement
had
been
entered
into
that
betsy
should
still
go
to
halliburton
to
do
the
washing
after
her
own
fashion
but
jane
could
not
afford
to
be
fastidious
now
and
also
what
was
wanted
in
the
way
of
scouring
betsy
being
paid
a
trifle
in
return
and
instructed
in
the
mysteries
of
reading
and
writing
no
profit
observed
carter
to
a
crony
but
no
loss
her
wo
do
nothing
at
home
let
me
cry
after
her
as
i
will
out
her
goes
gampusing
to
this
house
gampusing
to
that
but
not
a
bit
of
work
her
stick
to
at
home
if
these
new
folks
can
keep
her
to
work
a
bit
so
much
the
better
it
be
getting
her
hand
in
and
better
still
if
they
teaches
her
to
read
and
write
her
would
learn
nothing
from
the
not
a
very
favourable
description
of
miss
betsy
but
what
the
girl
chiefly
wanted
was
a
firm
hand
over
her
her
temper
and
disposition
were
good
but
she
was
an
only
child
and
her
mother
though
possessing
a
firm
hand
and
a
firm
tongue
too
in
general
none
more
so
in
honey
fair
had
spoilt
and
indulged
miss
betsy
until
her
authority
was
gone
after
her
business
was
over
this
evening
with
carter
jane
who
wanted
some
darning
cotton
turned
into
buffle
shop
that
priestess
was
in
her
accustomed
place
behind
the
counter
she
curtseyed
twice
and
spoke
in
a
low
subdued
tone
in
deference
to
the
widow
cap
and
bonnet
to
the
deep
mourning
altogether
which
curiosity
had
not
had
the
gratification
of
beholding
before
would
you
like
it
fine
or
coarse
mum
here
both
a
great
assortment
but
it
the
best
quality
i
do
have
much
call
for
darning
cotton
mum
the
folks
round
about
is
always
at
their
gloving
work
but
they
must
mend
their
stockings
observed
jane
not
they
returned
buffle
they
go
in
naked
heels
mum
afore
they
take
a
needle
and
darn
up
they
have
took
to
wear
them
untidy
boots
to
cover
the
holes
and
away
they
go
with
unlaced
tongue
hanging
and
tag
trailing
half
a
mile
behind
great
big
slatterns
they
be
they
seem
always
at
work
remarked
jane
always
at
work
repeated
buffle
you
do
know
much
of
mum
or
you
not
say
it
they
play
one
day
and
work
the
next
that
their
work
it
only
a
few
of
the
steady
ones
that
work
regular
all
the
week
through
what
could
a
good
steady
workwoman
earn
a
week
at
the
that
depends
mum
upon
how
close
she
stuck
to
it
responded
buffle
i
mean
sitting
closely
oh
well
debated
buffle
carelessly
she
might
earn
ten
shillings
a
week
and
do
it
comfortable
ten
shillings
a
week
jane
heart
beat
hopefully
upon
ten
shillings
a
week
she
might
manage
to
exist
to
keep
her
children
from
starvation
until
better
days
arose
impelled
by
necessity
could
sit
longer
and
closer
too
than
perhaps
those
women
did
buffle
continued
full
of
inward
gratulation
that
her
silent
customer
had
come
round
to
gossip
at
last
they
be
the
improvidentest
things
in
the
world
mum
these
gloveress
girls
sundays
they
be
dressed
up
as
grand
as
queens
flowers
inside
their
bonnets
and
ribbuns
out
the
churches
and
chapels
alight
with
their
finery
and
then
off
for
walks
with
their
sweethearts
all
the
afternoon
and
evening
mondays
is
mostly
spent
in
waste
gathering
of
themselves
at
each
other
houses
talking
and
laughing
or
may
be
off
to
the
fields
again
anything
for
idleness
tuesdays
is
often
the
same
and
then
the
rest
of
the
week
they
has
to
scout
over
their
work
to
get
it
in
on
the
saturday
ah
you
do
know
mum
jane
paid
for
her
darning
cotton
and
came
away
much
to
regret
ten
shillings
a
week
kept
ringing
in
her
ears
chapter
xix
reece
and
dobbs
jane
was
busy
that
evening
but
the
following
morning
she
went
into
samuel
lynn
patience
was
in
the
kitchen
washing
currants
for
a
pudding
the
maid
upstairs
at
her
work
jane
held
the
body
of
frock
in
her
hand
she
wished
to
try
it
on
anna
is
not
at
home
was
the
reply
of
patience
she
is
gone
to
spend
the
day
with
mary
ashley
jane
felt
sorry
she
had
been
in
hopes
of
finishing
it
that
day
patience
said
she
i
want
to
ask
your
advice
i
have
been
thinking
that
i
might
get
employment
at
sewing
gloves
it
seems
easy
work
to
learn
would
thee
like
the
work
asked
patience
ladies
have
a
prejudice
against
it
because
it
is
the
work
supplied
to
the
poor
not
but
that
some
ladies
in
this
town
willing
to
eke
out
their
means
do
work
at
it
in
private
they
get
the
work
brought
out
to
them
and
taken
in
that
would
be
the
worst
for
me
observed
jane
taking
in
the
work
i
do
fear
i
should
not
like
it
of
course
not
thee
could
not
go
to
the
manufactory
and
stand
amid
the
crowd
of
women
for
thy
turn
to
be
served
as
one
of
them
wait
thee
an
instant
patience
dried
her
hands
upon
the
and
took
jane
into
the
best
parlour
the
one
less
frequently
used
opening
a
closet
she
reached
from
it
a
small
machine
and
some
unmade
gloves
the
latter
were
in
a
basket
covered
over
with
a
white
cloth
this
is
different
work
from
what
the
women
do
said
she
it
is
what
is
called
the
french
point
and
is
confined
to
a
few
of
the
chief
manufacturers
it
is
not
allowed
to
be
done
publicly
lest
all
should
get
hold
of
the
stitch
those
who
employ
the
point
have
it
done
in
private
who
does
it
here
exclaimed
jane
i
do
said
patience
laughing
did
thee
think
i
should
be
like
the
fine
ladies
ashamed
to
put
my
hand
to
it
i
and
james
meeking
wife
do
all
that
is
at
present
being
done
for
the
ashley
manufactory
but
now
look
thee
samuel
lynn
was
saying
only
last
night
that
they
must
search
out
for
some
other
hand
who
would
be
trustworthy
for
they
want
more
of
the
work
done
it
is
easy
to
learn
and
i
know
they
would
give
it
thee
it
is
a
little
better
paid
than
the
other
work
too
sit
thee
down
and
try
it
patience
fixed
the
back
of
the
glove
in
the
pretty
little
square
machine
took
the
needle
a
peculiar
one
and
showed
how
it
was
to
be
done
jane
in
a
glow
of
delight
accomplished
some
stitches
readily
i
see
thee
would
be
handy
at
it
said
patience
thee
can
take
the
machine
indoors
and
practise
i
will
give
thee
a
piece
of
old
leather
to
exercise
upon
in
two
or
three
days
thee
may
be
quite
perfect
i
do
not
work
very
much
at
it
myself
at
which
samuel
lynn
grumbles
it
is
all
my
own
profit
what
i
earn
so
that
he
has
no
selfish
motive
in
urging
me
to
work
except
that
they
want
more
of
it
done
but
i
have
my
household
matters
to
attend
to
and
anna
takes
up
my
time
i
get
enough
for
my
clothes
and
that
is
all
i
care
for
i
know
i
could
do
it
i
could
do
it
well
patience
then
i
am
sure
thee
may
have
it
to
do
they
will
supply
thee
with
a
machine
and
samuel
lynn
will
bring
thy
work
home
and
take
it
back
again
as
he
does
mine
he
william
was
bursting
in
upon
them
with
a
beaming
face
mamma
make
haste
home
two
ladies
are
asking
to
see
the
rooms
jane
hurried
in
in
the
parlour
sat
a
old
lady
in
a
large
black
silk
bonnet
the
other
smarter
younger
but
must
have
been
forty
at
least
and
very
wore
a
leghorn
bonnet
with
green
and
scarlet
bows
she
was
the
old
lady
companion
housekeeper
servant
all
combined
in
one
as
jane
found
afterwards
you
have
lodgings
to
let
said
the
old
lady
can
we
see
them
this
is
the
jane
was
beginning
but
she
was
interrupted
by
the
smart
one
in
a
snappish
tone
the
do
you
call
this
furnished
do
be
hasty
dobbs
rebuked
her
mistress
hear
what
the
lady
has
to
say
the
furniture
is
homely
certainly
acknowledged
jane
but
it
is
new
and
clean
that
is
a
most
comfortable
sofa
the
bedrooms
are
above
the
old
lady
said
she
would
see
them
and
they
proceeded
upstairs
dobbs
put
her
head
into
one
room
and
withdrew
it
with
a
shriek
this
room
has
no
bedside
carpets
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
have
no
bedside
carpets
at
present
said
jane
feeling
all
the
discouragement
of
the
avowal
i
will
get
some
as
soon
as
i
possibly
can
if
any
one
taking
the
rooms
will
kindly
do
without
them
for
a
little
while
perhaps
we
might
dobbs
suggested
the
old
lady
who
appeared
to
be
of
an
accommodating
easy
nature
readily
satisfied
begging
your
pardon
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
returned
dobbs
we
should
have
you
doubled
up
with
cramp
if
you
clapped
your
feet
on
to
a
cold
floor
am
not
going
to
do
it
i
never
do
have
cramp
dobbs
which
is
no
reason
why
you
never
should
authoritatively
returned
dobbs
what
a
lovely
view
from
these
back
windows
exclaimed
the
old
lady
dobbs
do
you
see
the
malvern
hills
we
do
eat
and
drink
views
testily
responded
dobbs
they
are
pleasant
to
look
at
though
said
her
mistress
i
like
these
rooms
is
there
a
closet
or
small
apartment
that
we
could
have
for
our
trunks
if
we
came
we
are
not
coming
interrupted
dobbs
before
jane
could
answer
carpetless
floors
wo
suit
us
there
is
a
closet
here
over
the
entrance
said
jane
to
the
old
lady
as
she
opened
the
door
our
own
boxes
are
in
it
now
but
i
can
have
them
moved
upstairs
so
there
a
is
there
put
in
dobbs
a
what
cried
jane
who
had
never
heard
the
word
there
is
nothing
upstairs
but
an
attic
a
garret
as
it
is
called
here
yes
burst
forth
dobbs
it
is
called
a
garret
by
them
that
want
to
be
fine
is
good
enough
for
us
decent
folk
we
never
called
it
anything
else
who
sleeps
up
there
she
summarily
demanded
my
little
boys
this
was
their
room
but
i
have
put
them
upstairs
that
i
may
let
this
one
there
said
dobbs
triumphantly
as
she
turned
to
her
mistress
you
believe
me
another
time
i
hope
i
told
you
i
knew
there
was
a
pack
of
children
one
of
opened
the
door
to
us
perhaps
they
are
quiet
children
said
the
old
lady
who
had
been
so
long
used
to
the
grumbling
and
domineering
of
dobbs
that
she
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
they
are
indeed
said
jane
quiet
good
children
i
will
answer
for
it
that
they
will
not
disturb
you
in
any
way
i
should
like
to
see
the
kitchen
said
the
old
lady
we
only
want
the
use
of
it
snapped
dobbs
our
kitchen
fire
goes
out
after
dinner
and
i
boil
the
kettle
for
tea
in
the
parlour
would
attendance
be
required
asked
jane
of
the
old
lady
no
it
would
answered
dobbs
in
the
same
tart
tone
i
wait
upon
my
missis
and
i
wait
upon
myself
and
we
have
a
woman
in
to
do
the
cleaning
and
the
washing
goes
out
the
answer
gave
jane
great
relief
upon
lodgers
had
been
a
dubious
prospect
in
more
respects
than
one
it
a
very
good
kitchen
said
the
old
lady
as
they
went
in
and
she
turned
round
in
it
i
be
bound
it
smokes
said
dobbs
no
it
does
not
replied
jane
where
the
coalhouse
asked
dobbs
is
there
two
only
one
said
jane
it
is
at
the
back
of
the
kitchen
then
if
we
did
come
where
could
our
coal
be
put
fiercely
demanded
dobbs
i
must
have
my
coalhouse
to
myself
with
a
lock
and
key
i
want
the
house
fires
supplied
from
my
missis
coal
jane
cheeks
flushed
as
she
turned
to
the
old
lady
allow
me
to
assure
you
that
your
property
of
whatever
nature
it
may
be
will
be
perfectly
sacred
in
this
house
whether
locked
up
or
not
it
will
be
left
untouched
by
me
and
mine
to
be
sure
pleasantly
returned
the
old
lady
i
not
afraid
you
must
not
mind
what
dobbs
says
she
means
nothing
and
our
safe
for
meat
and
butter
proceeded
that
undaunted
functionary
is
there
a
key
to
it
and
now
about
the
rent
said
the
old
lady
giving
jane
no
time
to
answer
that
there
was
a
key
jane
hesitated
and
then
with
a
flush
asked
twenty
shillings
a
week
my
conscience
uttered
dobbs
twenty
shillings
a
week
and
us
finding
spoons
and
linen
dobbs
said
the
old
lady
i
do
see
that
it
is
so
very
out
of
the
way
a
parlour
two
bedrooms
a
closet
and
the
kitchen
all
furnished
the
closet
an
empty
dark
hole
and
the
kitchen
only
the
use
of
it
and
the
bedrooms
are
carpetless
reiterated
dobbs
drowning
her
mistress
voice
but
if
anybody
asked
you
for
your
head
just
cut
it
off
and
give
it
if
i
was
at
hand
to
stop
you
well
dobbs
we
have
seen
nothing
else
to
suit
us
up
here
and
you
know
i
want
to
settle
myself
at
this
end
of
the
town
on
account
of
it
being
high
and
dry
parry
says
i
must
we
have
not
half
looked
yet
said
dobbs
a
pound
is
a
good
price
and
we
have
not
paid
quite
so
much
where
we
are
but
i
do
know
that
it
unreasonable
continued
the
old
lady
to
jane
what
shall
we
do
dobbs
do
why
of
course
you
come
out
and
try
higher
up
to
take
these
rooms
without
looking
out
for
others
would
be
as
bad
as
buying
a
pig
in
a
poke
come
along
bedrooms
without
carpets
wo
do
for
us
at
any
price
she
added
to
jane
by
way
of
a
party
salutation
they
left
the
house
the
lady
with
a
cordial
good
morning
dobbs
with
none
at
all
and
went
quarrelling
up
the
road
that
is
the
old
lady
reasoning
and
dobbs
disputing
the
former
proposed
if
they
saw
nothing
to
suit
them
better
to
purchase
bedside
carpeting
upon
which
dobbs
accused
her
of
wanting
to
bring
herself
to
the
workhouse
patience
who
had
watched
them
away
from
her
parlour
window
came
in
to
learn
the
success
she
brought
in
with
her
the
machine
a
plain
piece
of
leather
the
size
of
the
back
of
a
glove
neatly
fixed
in
it
tears
were
falling
i
think
they
would
have
taken
them
had
there
been
bedside
carpets
sighed
she
oh
patience
what
a
help
it
would
been
i
asked
a
pound
a
week
did
thee
that
was
a
good
price
considering
thee
would
not
have
to
give
attendance
how
do
you
know
i
should
not
asked
jane
because
i
know
hannah
dobbs
waits
upon
her
mistress
replied
patience
she
is
the
widow
of
joseph
reece
and
he
left
her
well
off
i
heard
they
were
coming
to
live
up
this
way
did
they
quite
decline
them
because
i
can
tell
thee
what
we
have
some
strips
of
bedside
carpet
not
being
used
and
i
would
not
mind
lending
them
till
thee
can
buy
others
it
is
a
pity
thee
should
lose
the
letting
for
the
sake
of
a
bit
of
carpet
jane
looked
up
gratefully
what
should
i
have
done
without
you
patience
nay
it
is
not
much
thee
art
welcome
i
would
not
risk
the
carpet
with
unknown
people
but
hannah
dobbs
is
cleanly
and
careful
she
has
a
very
repelling
manner
observed
jane
it
is
not
agreeable
assented
patience
with
a
smile
but
she
is
attached
to
her
mistress
and
serves
her
faithfully
jane
sat
down
to
practise
upon
the
leather
watching
the
road
at
the
same
time
in
about
an
hour
she
saw
reece
and
dobbs
returning
william
went
out
and
asked
if
they
would
step
in
they
were
already
coming
they
had
seen
nothing
they
liked
so
well
jane
said
she
believed
she
could
promise
them
bedside
carpets
then
i
think
we
will
decide
said
the
old
lady
we
saw
one
set
of
rooms
very
nice
ones
and
they
asked
only
seventeen
shillings
but
they
have
a
young
man
lodger
a
pupil
at
the
infirmary
and
he
comes
home
at
all
hours
of
the
night
dobbs
questioned
them
till
they
confessed
that
it
was
so
i
know
what
them
infirmary
pupils
is
indignantly
put
in
dobbs
i
am
not
going
to
suffer
my
missis
to
come
in
contact
with
their
habits
there
ai
one
of
as
thinks
anything
of
stopping
out
till
morning
light
and
before
the
sun
up
they
have
a
pipe
in
their
mouths
filling
the
house
with
smoke
it
said
too
that
there
mysterious
big
boxes
brought
to
for
what
they
call
the
of
science
perhaps
some
of
the
churchyard
sextons
could
tell
what
in
well
dobbs
i
think
we
may
take
this
good
lady
rooms
i
sure
we
sha
get
better
suited
elsewhere
dobbs
only
grunted
she
was
tired
with
her
walk
and
had
really
no
objection
to
the
rooms
except
as
to
price
that
she
persisted
in
disputing
as
outrageous
i
suppose
you
would
not
take
less
said
the
old
lady
to
jane
jane
hesitated
but
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
be
otherwise
than
candid
and
truthful
i
would
take
a
trifle
less
sooner
than
not
let
you
the
rooms
but
i
am
very
poor
and
every
shilling
is
a
consideration
to
me
well
i
will
take
them
at
the
price
concluded
the
old
lady
and
dobbs
if
you
grumble
i
ca
help
it
can
we
come
in
let
me
see
this
is
wednesday
i
wo
come
in
on
a
friday
for
anybody
interrupted
dobbs
fiercely
we
will
come
in
on
tuesday
next
decided
the
old
lady
before
that
i
send
in
a
trolley
of
coal
if
you
be
so
kind
as
to
receive
it
and
to
lock
it
up

chapter

the
glove
operatives
at
the
hours
of
going
to
and
leaving
work
the
helstonleigh
streets
were
alive
with
glove
operatives
some
being
in
one
branch
of
the
trade
some
in
another
there
were
parers
grounders
dyers
cutters
and
so
on
all
being
necessary
besides
the
sewing
to
turn
out
one
pair
of
gloves
though
i
dare
say
you
did
not
think
it
the
wages
varied
according
to
the
particular
work
or
the
ability
and
industry
from
fifteen
shillings
a
week
to
but
all
could
earn
a
good
living
if
a
man
gained
more
than
he
had
a
stated
salary
as
was
the
case
with
the
foremen
these
wages
joined
to
what
was
earned
by
the
women
were
sufficient
to
maintain
a
comfortable
home
and
to
bring
up
children
decently
unfortunately
the
same
drawbacks
prevailed
in
helstonleigh
that
are
but
too
common
elsewhere
and
they
may
be
classed
under
one
general
head
improvidence
the
men
were
given
to
idling
away
at
the
more
time
than
was
good
for
them
the
women
to
scold
and
to
quarrel
some
were
slatterns
and
a
great
many
gave
their
husbands
the
welcome
of
a
home
of
discomfort
and
dirt
which
of
course
had
the
effect
of
sending
them
out
all
the
more
surely
just
about
this
period
the
men
had
their
especial
grievance
or
thought
they
had
and
that
was
a
low
rate
of
wages
and
not
full
employment
had
they
paid
a
visit
to
other
places
and
compared
their
wages
with
some
earned
by
operatives
of
a
different
class
they
had
found
less
cause
to
complain
the
men
were
rather
given
to
comparing
present
wages
with
those
they
had
earned
before
the
dark
crisis
dark
as
far
as
helstonleigh
trade
was
concerned
when
the
british
ports
were
opened
to
foreign
gloves
but
few
comparatively
speaking
of
the
manufacturers
had
weathered
that
storm
years
have
elapsed
since
then
but
the
employment
remained
scarce
and
the
wages
i
have
quoted
them
to
you
low
altogether
the
men
were
many
of
them
dissatisfied
they
even
went
so
far
as
to
talk
of
a
strike
strikes
being
less
common
in
those
days
than
they
are
in
these
it
was
saturday
night
and
the
streets
were
crowded
the
hands
were
pouring
out
of
the
different
manufactories
respectable
workmen
as
a
whole
for
the
branches
of
are
for
the
most
part
of
a
cleanly
nature
some
wore
their
white
aprons
some
had
rolled
them
up
round
their
waists
a
few
very
few
it
must
be
owned
were
going
to
their
homes
but
the
greater
portion
were
bound
for
the
one
of
the
most
extensively
patronised
of
the
was
the
cutters
arms
on
a
saturday
night
when
the
men
pockets
were
lined
this
would
be
crowded
the
men
flocked
into
it
now
and
filled
it
although
its
room
for
entertainment
was
very
large
the
order
from
most
of
them
was
a
pint
of
mild
ale
and
some
tobacco
any
news
joe
fisher
asked
a
man
when
the
pipes
were
set
going
joe
fisher
tossed
his
head
and
growled
he
was
a
tall
dark
man
clothes
and
condition
both
dilapidated
the
questioner
took
a
few
whiffs
and
repeated
his
question
joe
growled
again
but
did
not
speak
well
you
might
give
a
chap
a
civil
answer
fisher
what
the
matter
you
two
cried
a
third
ben
wilks
asks
me
is
there
any
news
called
out
fisher
indignantly
i
thought
he
might
ha
heered
o
without
asking
our
pay
was
docked
again
that
the
news
no
uttered
wilks
it
were
said
fisher
savagely
a
shilling
a
week
less
good
to
stand
it
there
ai
no
help
for
standing
it
interposed
a
man
named
wheeler
i
suppose
the
masters
is
forced
to
lower
they
say
so
have
your
master
forced
hisself
to
it
angrily
retorted
fisher
well
fisher
you
know
i
fortunate
as
all
is
that
gets
in
to
work
at
ashley
and
precious
good
care
they
take
to
stop
in
cried
fisher
much
aggravated
no
danger
that
ashley
hands
give
way
and
afford
outsiders
a
chance
why
should
they
give
way
sensibly
asked
wheeler
need
never
think
to
get
in
at
ashley
fisher
so
there
no
cause
for
you
to
grumble
a
titter
went
round
at
fisher
expense
he
did
not
like
it
i
might
stand
my
chance
with
others
if
there
was
room
who
says
i
could
come
now
a
man
laughed
you
had
better
ask
samuel
lynn
that
question
fisher
why
he
would
look
at
you
you
are
not
steady
enough
for
him
samuel
lynn
may
go
along
for
a
broadbrim
was
retort
there
not
be
half
the
difficulty
in
getting
in
with
ashley
hisself
yes
there
would
said
wheeler
quietly
ashley
pays
first
wages
and
he
have
first
hands
quaker
lynn
knows
what
he
about
do
dispute
about
nothing
fisher
interrupted
a
voice
borne
through
the
clouds
of
smoke
from
the
far
end
of
the
room
to
lose
a
shilling
a
week
is
bad
but
not
so
bad
as
losing
all
i
have
heard
ill
news
this
evening
fisher
stretched
up
his
long
neck
who
that
is
it
mr
crouch
it
was
stephen
crouch
the
foreman
in
a
large
firm
and
a
respectable
intelligent
man
do
you
remember
any
of
you
that
a
report
arose
some
time
ago
about
wilson
and
king
a
report
that
died
away
again
that
they
were
on
their
last
legs
replied
several
voices
well
well
they
are
off
them
now
continued
stephen
crouch
up
rose
a
man
his
voice
shaking
with
emotion
it
not
true
crouch
sure
ly
it
is
vincent
wilson
and
king
are
going
to
wind
up
it
will
be
announced
next
week
mercy
help
us
there
be
forty
more
hands
throwed
out
what
to
become
of
us
all
a
dead
silence
fell
on
the
room
vincent
broke
it
hope
is
strong
in
the
human
heart
crouch
i
do
think
it
can
be
true
our
wages
was
all
paid
up
and
we
have
not
heard
a
breath
o
i
know
all
that
said
stephen
crouch
i
know
where
the
money
came
from
to
pay
them
it
came
from
mr
ashley
the
assertion
astonished
the
room
from
ashley
did
he
tell
it
abroad
tell
it
indignantly
returned
stephen
crouch
ashley
is
an
honourable
man
no
wilson
and
king
have
a
tattler
too
near
to
them
that
how
it
came
out
not
but
what
it
would
have
been
known
all
over
helstonleigh
on
monday
all
particulars
every
sixpence
pretty
near
that
wilson
and
king
have
is
locked
up
in
their
stock
they
expected
remittances
by
the
london
mail
this
morning
and
they
did
not
come
they
went
to
the
bank
the
bank
was
shy
and
would
not
make
advances
and
they
had
nothing
in
hand
for
wages
they
went
to
ashley
and
told
him
their
perplexity
and
he
drew
a
cheque
the
bank
cashed
that
with
a
bow
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
ashley
ned
vincent
you
and
the
rest
of
their
hands
would
have
gone
home
with
empty
pockets
will
ashley
lose
the
money
not
he
he
knew
there
was
no
danger
of
that
when
he
lent
it
nobody
will
lose
by
wilson
and
king
they
have
more
than
enough
to
pay
everybody
in
full
only
their
money
locked
up
why
are
they
giving
up
because
they
ca
keep
on
they
have
been
losing
a
long
while
what
do
you
ask
what
will
they
do
they
must
do
as
others
have
done
before
them
who
have
been
unable
to
keep
on
if
wilson
and
king
had
given
up
ten
years
ago
they
had
then
each
a
nice
little
bit
of
property
to
retire
upon
but
it
has
been
sunk
since
there
are
too
many
others
in
this
city
in
the
same
ease
and
what
to
become
of
us
hands
that
throwed
out
asked
vincent
returning
to
his
own
personal
grievance
you
must
try
and
get
taken
on
somewhere
else
vincent
observed
stephen
crouch
there
ai
a
better
cutter
than
ned
vincent
going
cried
another
voice
he
wo
wait
long
i
do
know
about
that
returned
vincent
gloomily
the
masters
is
overdone
with
hands
of
all
the
bad
luck
as
ever
fell
upon
a
town
the
opening
of
the
ports
to
them
foreign
french
was
the
worst
for
helstonleigh
broke
in
the
intemperate
voice
of
fisher
hold
th
tongue
fisher
exclaimed
a
sensible
voice
we
wo
get
into
them
discussions
again
did
we
go
over
night
after
night
and
year
after
year
till
we
were
and
what
did
they
ever
bring
us
but
it
done
and
it
ca
be
undone
the
ports
be
open
and
they
never
be
closed
again
did
the
opening
of
ruin
the
trade
of
helstonleigh
or
did
it
answer
me
that
said
fisher
it
did
we
know
it
to
our
cost
was
the
sad
answer
but
there
no
help
for
it
oh
returned
fisher
ironically
i
thought
you
were
going
to
hold
out
that
the
opening
of
was
a
boon
to
the
place
and
the
keeping
open
a
blessing
that
be
a
new
dodge
do
they
keep
open
just
hark
at
fisher
said
buffle
in
a
mincing
tone
he
wants
to
know
why
government
keeps
open
the
british
ports
do
every
dozen
of
gloves
that
comes
into
the
country
pay
a
heavy
duty
is
it
likely
government
would
give
up
that
fisher
what
did
they
do
afore
they
had
it
roared
fisher
if
they
did
without
the
duty
then
they
could
do
without
it
now
i
have
heered
of
some
gents
as
never
tasted
sugar
returned
buffle
but
i
never
heered
of
one
who
had
the
liking
for
it
as
was
willing
to
forego
the
use
of
it
it
a
case
in
pint
the
government
have
tasted
the
sweets
of
the
and
they
stick
to
it
avaricious
wolves
growled
fisher
but
you
are
a
fool
dandy
for
all
that
what
a
bit
of
paltry
duty
alongside
of
our
wants
if
a
few
of
them
great
government
lords
had
to
go
on
empty
stomachs
for
a
month
they
know
what
the
opening
of
ports
means
in
all
political
changes
such
as
this
certain
localities
must
suffer
broke
in
the
quiet
voice
of
stephen
crouch
it
will
be
the
means
of
increasing
commerce
wonderfully
and
we
that
the
measure
crushed
must
be
content
to
suffer
for
the
general
good
the
effects
to
us
can
never
be
undone
i
know
what
you
say
fisher
he
continued
silencing
fisher
by
a
gesture
i
know
that
the
ports
might
be
if
government
so
willed
it
but
it
could
not
undo
for
us
what
has
been
done
it
could
not
repair
the
ruin
that
was
wrought
on
helstonleigh
it
could
not
reinstate
firms
in
business
or
refund
to
the
masters
their
wasted
capital
or
collect
the
hands
it
scattered
over
the
country
to
find
a
bit
of
work
to
beg
or
to
starve
or
bring
the
dead
back
to
life
it
could
not
do
any
of
this
neither
would
it
restore
a
flourishing
trade
to
those
of
us
who
are
left
what
that
last
crouch
it
never
would
emphatically
repeated
stephen
crouch
a
shattered
trade
can
not
be
brought
together
again
it
is
like
a
shattered
glass
you
may
mourn
over
the
pieces
but
you
can
not
put
them
together
believe
me
or
not
as
you
please
my
friends
but
the
only
thing
remaining
is
to
make
the
best
of
what
is
left
to
us
there
are
other
trades
a
deal
worse
off
than
we
are
i
have
talked
to
ye
about
that
there
move
a
strike
resumed
fisher
after
a
pause
we
shall
get
no
good
till
we
try
it
fisher
do
you
be
a
fool
and
show
it
was
the
imperative
interruption
of
stephen
crouch
i
have
explained
to
you
till
i
am
tired
what
would
be
the
effects
of
a
strike
it
would
just
finish
you
bad
workmen
up
and
send
you
and
your
children
into
the
nearest
dry
ditch
for
a
floor
with
the
open
skies
above
you
for
a
roof
we
have
never
tried
a
strike
in
helstonleigh
answered
fisher
holding
to
his
own
opinion
and
i
trust
we
never
shall
returned
the
intelligent
foreman
other
trades
may
have
their
strikes
if
they
choose
and
it
not
our
business
to
find
fault
with
them
for
it
but
the
glove
trade
has
hitherto
kept
itself
aloof
from
strikes
and
it
to
be
hoped
it
always
will
you
can
not
understand
how
a
strike
works
joe
fisher
or
you
not
let
your
head
be
running
on
it
others
heads
be
running
on
it
as
well
as
mine
master
crouch
said
fisher
nodding
significantly
it
is
not
improbable
was
the
equable
rejoinder
of
stephen
crouch
go
and
strike
next
week
half
a
dozen
of
you
i
mean
the
operatives
of
half
a
dozen
firms
every
firm
in
the
place
must
strike
interrupted
fisher
hastily
a
few
on
us
doing
it
would
only
make
bad
worse
stephen
crouch
smiled
exactly
but
the
difficulty
fisher
will
be
that
all
the
firms
strike
ask
the
men
in
our
firm
to
strike
ask
those
in
ashley
ask
others
that
we
could
name
and
what
would
their
answer
be
why
that
they
know
when
they
are
well
off
suppose
for
argument
sake
that
we
did
all
strike
suppose
all
the
hands
in
helstonleigh
struck
next
monday
morning
and
the
manufactories
had
to
be
closed
who
would
have
the
worst
of
it
we
or
the
masters
the
masters
returned
fisher
in
an
obstinate
tone
no
the
masters
have
good
houses
over
their
heads
and
their
books
to
supply
their
wants
while
they
are
waiting
and
their
orders
are
not
so
great
that
they
need
fear
much
pressure
on
that
score
the
london
houses
would
dispatch
a
few
extra
orders
to
paris
and
grenoble
and
the
masters
here
might
enjoy
a
nice
little
trip
to
the
while
our
senses
were
coming
back
to
us
but
where
should
we
be
out
at
elbows
out
at
pocket
out
at
heart
some
starving
some
in
the
workhouse
if
you
want
to
avoid
those
contingencies
joe
fisher
you
keep
from
strikes
fisher
answered
by
an
ironical
cheer
here
missis
said
he
to
the
landlady
who
was
then
passing
him
let
have
another
pint
after
that
that
make
nine
pints
you
owe
for
since
monday
night
joe
fisher
responded
the
landlady
what
if
i
do
grunted
fisher
irascibly
i
am
able
to
pay
out

work

the
ladies
of
honey
fair
it
was
saturday
night
in
honey
fair
a
night
when
the
ladies
were
at
leisure
to
abandon
themselves
to
their
private
pursuits
the
work
of
the
past
week
had
gone
into
the
warehouses
and
the
fresh
work
brought
out
would
not
be
begun
until
monday
morning
some
of
them
as
buffle
has
informed
us
did
not
begin
it
then
the
women
chiefly
cleaned
their
houses
and
mended
their
clothes
some
washed
and
ironed
honey
fair
was
not
famous
for
its
management
not
going
to
bed
till
sunday
morning
some
did
their
marketing
and
a
few
careless
and
lazy
spent
it
in
running
from
house
to
house
or
congregated
in
the
road
to
gossip
about
eight
one
of
the
latter
suddenly
lifted
the
latch
of
a
house
door
and
thrust
in
her
head
it
was
joe
fisher
wife
her
face
was
red
and
her
cap
in
tatters
is
our
becky
in
here
mrs
carter
carter
was
busy
she
was
the
maternal
parent
of
miss
betsy
her
kitchen
fire
was
out
her
furniture
was
heaped
one
thing
upon
another
a
pail
of
water
stood
ready
to
wash
the
brick
floor
when
she
should
have
finished
rubbing
up
the
grate
and
her
hands
and
face
were
as
grimy
as
the
there
no
becky
here
snapped
she
i
ca

her
returned
fisher
i
thought
her
might
be
along
of
your
betsy

say
here
your
husband
coming
round
the
corner
there
mark
mason
and
robert
east
and
dale
along
of
him
and

what

that
young
of
east
been
doing
to
hisself
he
black
from
head
to
foot
come
and
look
carter
disdained
the
invitation
she
was
a
thrifty
woman
but
a
cross
one
priding
herself
upon
her
cleanliness
she
perpetually
returned
loud
thanks
that
she
was
not
as
the
dirty
ones
around
her
she
was
the
pharisee
amidst
many
publicans
if
i
passed
my
time
staring
and
gossiping
as
some
does
where
my
work
be
was
her
rebuke
shut
the
door
suke
fisher
suke
fisher
did
as
she
was
bid
she
turned
her
wrists
back
upon
her
hips
and
walked
to
meet
the
advancing
party
having
discerned
their
approach
by
the
light
of
the
be
you
going
to
be
sold
for
a
blackamoor
demanded
she
of
the
boy
the
boy
laughed
his
head
face
shoulders
hands
were
ornamented
with
a
thick
black
liquid
not
unlike
blacking
he
appeared
to
enjoy
the
treat
as
if
he
had
been
anointed
with
some
fragrant
oil
he
is
not
a
bad
spectacle
is
he
dame
fisher
remarked
the
young
man
whom
she
had
called
robert
east
what
it
questioned
she
him
and
jacky
brumm
got
larking
and
upset
the
upon
themselves
we
rubbed
down
with
the
leather
shreds
but
it
keeps
on
dripping
from
their
hair
wo
charlotte
warm
his
back
for
him
apostrophised
fisher
the
boy
threw
a
disdainful
look
at
her
in
return
for
the
remark
charlotte
not
so
fond
of
warming
backs
she
never
even
scolds
for
an
accident
the
boy
and
robert
east
were
they
entered
one
of
the
cottages
robert
east
and
his
sister
were
between
twenty
and
thirty
and
the
boy
was
ten
their
mother
had
died
early
and
the
young
mother
their
father
second
wife
died
when
the
child
was
born
the
father
also
died
how
robert
and
his
sister
the
one
then
seventeen
the
other
fourteen
had
struggled
to
make
a
living
for
themselves
and
to
bring
up
the
baby
they
alone
knew
the
manner
in
which
they
had
succeeded
was
a
marvel
to
many
none
were
more
respectable
now
than
they
were
in
all
honey
fair
charlotte
neat
and
nice
sat
by
her
bright
kitchen
fire
a
savoury
stew
cooking
on
the
hob
beside
it
it
was
her
custom
to
have
something
good
for
supper
on
a
saturday
night
did
she
make
home
attractive
on
that
night
to
draw
her
brother
from
the
seductions
of
the
most
likely
and
she
had
her
reward
for
robert
never
failed
to
come
the
cloth
was
laid
the
red
bricks
of
the
floor
were
clean
and
face
as
she
looked
up
from
her
was
bright
it
darkened
to
consternation
however
when
she
cast
her
eyes
on
the
boy
tom
what
you
been
doing
jacky
brumm
threw
a
pot
of
dye
over
me
charlotte
there
not
much
real
damage
charlotte
interposed
her
brother
it
looks
worse
than
it
is
i
get
it
out
of
his
hair
presently
and
put
his
clothes
into
a
pail
of
water
what
have
you
got
it
smells
good
he
alluded
to
supper
and
took
off
the
lid
of
the
saucepan
to
peep
in
she
had
some
stewed
beef
with
carrots
and
the
savoury
steam
ascended
to
robert
pleased
face
very
few
in
honey
fair
managed
as
did
charlotte
east
how
she
did
her
housework
no
one
knew
not
a
woman
married
or
single
got
through
more
than
charlotte
not
one
kept
her
house
in
better
order
and
her
clothes
and
her
brother
were
neat
and
respectable
as
well
as
sundays
her
work
was
taken
into
the
warehouse
on
saturday
mornings
and
her
marketing
was
done
in
the
afternoon
she
cleaned
her
house
and
by
four
was
ready
to
sit
down
to
her
mending
no
one
ever
saw
her
in
a
bustle
and
yet
all
her
work
was
done
and
well
done
perhaps
one
great
secret
of
it
was
that
she
rose
very
early
in
the
morning
winter
and
summer
look
robert
here
is
a
nice
book
i
have
bought
said
she
putting
a
periodical
into
his
hands
it
comes
out
weekly
i
shall
take
it
in
robert
turned
over
the
leaves
it
seems
very
interesting
he
said
presently
here
a
paper
that
tells
all
about
the
holy
land
and
another
that
tells
us
how
glass
is
made
i
have
often
wondered
you
can
read
it
to
us
of
an
evening
while
i
work
said
she
it
will
be
quite
a
help
to
our
getting
on
tom
almost
as
good
as
sending
him
to
school
i
gave
the
words
were
interrupted
the
door
was
violently
burst
open
and
a
woman
entered
the
kitchen
knocking
at
doors
before
entering
was
not
the
fashion
in
honey
fair
the
intruder
was
brumm
i
say
robert
east
did
you
see
anything
of
my
husband
i
saw
him
go
into
the
horned
ram
then
i
wish
the
horned
ram
was
into
him
wrathfully
retorted
brumm
he
vowed
faithfully
he
come
home
with
his
wages
the
first
thing
after
leaving
work
he
knows
i
have
not
a
thing
in
the
place
for
and
dame
buffle
looking
out
for
her
money
i
have
a
good
mind
to
go
down
to
the
horned
ram
and
be
on
to
him
robert
east
offered
no
opinion
upon
this
delicate
point
he
remembered
the
last
time
brumm
had
gone
to
the
horned
ram
to
be
on
to
her
husband
and
what
it
had
produced
a
midnight
quarrel
that
disturbed
the
slumbers
of
honey
fair
who
was
along
of
him
pursued
she
three
or
four
of
them
hubbard
and
jones
i
saw
go
in
and
adam
thorneycroft
a
quick
rising
of
the
head
as
if
startled
and
a
faint
accession
of
colour
told
that
one
of
those
names
had
struck
perhaps
unpleasantly
on
the
ear
of
charlotte
east
where
are
your
own
earnings
she
asked
of
brumm
i
have
had
to
take
them
to
bankes
was
the
rueful
reply
it
a
good
deal
now
and
they
in
a
regular
tantrum
this
week
and
even
wait
till
monday
they
threatened
to
tell
brumm
and
it
frightened
me
out
of
my
seventeen
senses
and
now
for
him
to
go
into
that
dratted
horned
ram
with
his
wages
and
me
without
a
pennypiece
it
not
more
for
the
necessaries
i
want
to
get
in
than
for
the
things
that
is
in
pawn
i
ca
iron
nothing
the
irons
is
there
charlotte
busy
still
turned
round
i
would
not
put
in
irons
and
such
things
that
i
wanted
to
use
i
dare
say
you
would
tartly
responded
brumm
one
has
to
put
in
what
one
got
and
the
things
our
husbands
wo
miss
the
sight
of
it
fine
to
be
you
charlotte
east
setting
yourself
up
for
a
lady
and
never
putting
your
foot
inside
the
with
your
clean
hands
and
your
clean
kitchen
on
a
saturday
night
sitting
down
to
a
hot
supper
while
the
rest
of
us
is
charlotte
laughed
if
i
tried
to
set
myself
up
for
a
lady
i
could
not
be
one
i
work
as
hard
as
anybody
only
i
get
it
done
betimes
brumm
sniffed
having
no
ready
answer
at
hand
and
at
that
moment
tom
east
encased
in
black
peeped
out
of
the
brewhouse
where
he
had
been
sent
by
charlotte
to
wash
the
dye
off
his
hands
sakes
alive
uttered
brumm
aghast
at
the
sight
jacky
worse
than
me
responded
tom
rather
proud
of
having
to
say
so
much
robert
explained
to
her
how
it
had
happened
and
our
jacky
as
bad
as
that
she
cried
wo
i
wring
it
out
of
him
nonsense
said
robert
it
was
an
accident
boys
will
be
boys
yes
they
will
and
it
not
the
men
that
have
to
wash
for
and
keep
clean
retorted
brumm
terribly
wrathful
and
me
at
a
standstill
for
my
irons
and
that
beast
of
a
brumm
stopping
out
i
will
lend
you
my
irons
said
charlotte
i
wo
take
was
the
ungracious
reply
if
i
do
get
my
own
i
wo
borrow
none
brumm
he
be
looking
out
for
his
sunday
clean
shirt
and
he
wo
get
it
and
that
punish
him
more
than
anything
else
there
not
a
man
in
honey
fair
as
likes
to
go
sprucer
on
a
sunday
than
brumm
so
much
the
better
said
charlotte
when
men
lose
pride
in
their
appearance
they
are
apt
to
lose
it
in
their
conduct
you
must
always
put
in
your
word
for
folks
charlotte
east
let
be
ever
so
bad
was
brumm
parting
salutation
as
she
went
off
and
shut
the
door
with
a
bang
meanwhile
timothy
carter
carter
husband
had
turned
into
his
own
dwelling
after
leaving
robert
east
the
first
thing
to
greet
him
was
the
pail
of
water
carter
had
completed
her
grate
and
was
dashing
her
water
on
to
the
floor
timothy
received
it
on
his
legs
what
that
for
demanded
timothy
who
was
a
meek
and
timid
little
man
why
do
you
brush
in
so
sharp
then
cried
she
who
was
to
know
you
was
timothy
had
not
brushed
in
sharp
he
had
gone
in
quietly
he
stood
ruefully
shaking
the
wet
from
his
legs
first
one
then
the
other
and
afterwards
began
to
pick
his
way
on
tiptoe
towards
the
fireplace
now
it
of
no
use
your
attempting
to
sit
down
yet
rebuked
his
wife
in
her
usual
cross
accents
there
ai
no
room
for
you
at
the
fire
and
there
ai
no
warmth
in
it
it
but
this
blessed
minute
lighted
sit
yourself
on
that
table
again
the
wall
and
then
your
legs
be
in
the
dry
and
there
i
may
sit
for
an
hour
for
you
be
all
that
time
before
you
have
finished
by
the
looks
o
he
ventured
to
remonstrate
and
half
another
hour
to
the
end
of
it
answered
she
there
betsy
as
ought
to
be
helping
gadding
out
somewhere
ever
since
she
came
home
at
seven
you
says
to
me
says
you
come
home
tim
as
soon
as
work
over
and
do
go
drinking
you
know
you
did
repeated
timothy
in
an
injured
tone
and
it
a
good
thing
as
you
have
come
or
you
have
heard
my
tongue
in
a
way
you
would
like
was
carter
reply
timothy
sighed
that
tongue
was
the
sword
of
his
life
how
dreaded
none
but
himself
could
tell
he
had
mounted
the
table
in
obedience
to
orders
but
he
now
got
off
again
what
are
you
after
now
shrilly
demanded
carter
who
was
on
her
knees
scouring
the
bricks
i
want
my
pipe
and
you
stop
where
you
are
was
the
imperative
answer
and
wait
till
i
have
time
to
get
it
and
timothy
humbly
sat
down
again
you
might
get
this
done
afore
night
as
i
said
over
and
over
again
cried
he
plucking
up
a
little
spirit
when
a
man
comes
home
tired
even
if
there
ai
a
bit
o
supper
for
him
he
expects
a
morsel
o
fire
to
sit
down
to
so
as
he
can
smoke
his
pipe
in
quiet
it
cows
him
you
see
to
find
his
place
in
this
ruck
where
there
ai
a
dry
spot
to
put
the
sole
of
his
foot
on
and
nothing
but
a
table
with
unekal
legs
to
sit
upon
and
i
might
get
it
done
afore
shrieked
carter
afore
when
through
that
betsy
laziness
leaving
everything
on
my
shoulders
i
get
in
my
gloving
till
four
this
afternoon
every
earthly
thing
have
i
had
to
do
since
then
i
raked
out
my
fire
what
the
good
of
raking
out
the
fire
interposed
timothy
goodness
help
the
simpleton
wanting
to
know
the
good
of
raking
out
the
fire
as
if
he
was
born
yesterday
can
a
grate
be
while
it
hot
pray
it
might
be
at
some
other
time
debated
he
in
a
morning
perhaps
i
dare
say
it
might
if
i
had
not
my
gloving
to
do
she
answered
trembling
with
wrath
when
folks
takes
out
shop
work
they
has
to
get
on
with
that
and
is
glad
to
do
it
where
would
you
be
if
i
earned
nothing
it
is
much
of
a
roof
we
should
have
over
our
heads
with
your
paltry
fifteen
or
sixteen
shillings
you
be
nothing
but
a
parer
remember
there
no
need
to
disparage
of
me
he
rejoined
with
a
meek
little
cough
you
knowed
i
was
a
parer
before
you
ventured
on
me
just
take
your
legs
up
higher
or
you
be
knocking
my
cap
with
your
dirty
boots
said
carter
who
was
nearing
the
table
in
her
scrubbing
i
stand
outside
the
door
a
bit
i
think
he
answered
i
am
in
your
way
everywhere
sit
where
you
are
and
lift
up
your
legs
was
the
reiterated
command
and
timothy
obeyed
cold
and
dreary
on
he
sat
watching
the
cleaning
of
the
kitchen
the
fire
gave
out
no
heat
and
the
squares
of
bricks
did
not
dry
he
took
some
silver
from
his
pocket
and
laid
it
in
a
stack
on
the
table
beside
him
for
his
wife
to
take
up
at
her
leisure
she
allowed
him
no
chance
of
squandering
wages
a
few
minutes
and
carter
rose
from
her
knees
and
went
into
the
yard
for
a
fresh
supply
of
water
timothy
did
not
wait
for
a
second
ducking
he
slipped
off
the
table
took
a
shilling
from
the
heap
and
stole
from
the
house
back
came
carter
her
pail
brimming
you
go
over
to
dame
buffle
tim
and
why
where
he
gone
he
was
not
in
the
kitchen
that
was
certain
and
she
opened
the
staircase
door
and
elevated
her
voice
shrilly
are
you
gone
tramping
up
my
stairs
with
your
dirty
boots
tim
carter
i
say
are
you
upstairs
of
course
tim
carter
was
not
upstairs
or
he
had
never
dared
to
leave
that
voice
unanswered
now
if
he
has
gone
off
to
any
of
them
sotting
publics
he
sha
hear
the
last
of
it
she
exclaimed
opening
the
door
and
gazing
as
far
as
the
nearest
would
permit
but
timothy
was
beyond
her
eye
and
reach
and
she
caught
up
the
money
and
counted
it
fourteen
shillings
one
shilling
of
it
gone
she
knew
what
it
meant
and
dashed
the
silver
into
a
canister
on
the
high
mantelshelf
which
contained
also
her
own
earnings
for
the
week
it
would
have
been
as
much
as
meek
tim
carter
life
was
worth
to
touch
that
canister
and
she
kept
it
openly
on
the
many
unfortunate
wives
in
honey
fair
could
not
keep
their
money
from
their
husbands
even
under
lock
and
key
as
she
was
putting
the
canister
in
its
place
again
betsy
came
in
carter
turned
sharply
upon
her
now
miss
where
have
you
been
law
mother
how
you
fly
out
i
have
only
been
to
cross
you
ungrateful
piece
of
brass
when
you
know
there
so
much
to
be
done
on
a
that
i
ca
turn
myself
round
you
sha
go
gadding
about
half
your
time
i
put
you
from
home
entire
to
a
good
tight
service
betsy
had
heard
the
same
threat
so
often
that
its
effect
was
gone
had
her
mother
only
kept
her
in
of
the
subjection
that
she
did
her
husband
it
might
have
been
better
for
the
young
lady
i
was
only
in
at
cross
she
repeated
what
the
good
of
telling
me
that
falsehood
i
went
to
cross
after
you
but
you
was
there
and
had
been
there
you
want
a
good
sound
shaking
miss
if
i
was
at
cross
i
was
at
mason
was
the
imperturbable
reply
of
miss
betsy
i
was
at
mason
first
mark
mason
came
home
and
turned
as
sour
as
a
wasp
because
the
place
was
in
a
mess
she
was
washing
her
children
and
she
got
the
kitchen
to
do
and
he
began
blowing
up
i
left
then
and
went
in
to
cross
mason
went
back
down
the
hill
so
he
come
home
tipsy
why
ca
she
get
her
children
washed
afore
he
comes
home
retorted
carter
who
could
see
plenty
of
motes
in
her
neighbours
eyes
though
utterly
blind
to
the
beam
in
her
own
such
wretched
management
children
ought
to
be
packed
out
of
the
way
by
seven
you
do
get
your
cleaning
over
any
more
than
she
does
remarked
miss
betsy
boldly
carter
turned
an
angry
gaze
upon
her
a
torrent
of
words
breaking
from
her
lips
i
get
my
cleaning
over
i
who
am
at
work
every
moment
of
my
day
from
early
morning
till
late
at
night
you
liken
me
to
that
het
mason
who
hardly
makes
a
dozen
o
gloves
in
a
week
and
keeps
her
house
like
a
pigsty
where
would
you
and
your
father
be
if
i
did
work
to
keep
you
and
slave
to
make
the
place
sweet
and
comfortable
be
off
to
dame
buffle
and
buy
me
a
besom
you
ungrateful
monkey
and
then
you
turn
to
and
dust
these
chairs
betsy
did
not
wait
for
a
second
bidding
she
preferred
going
for
besoms
or
for
anything
else
to
her
mother
kitchen
and
her
mother
scolding
her
coming
back
was
another
affair
she
would
be
just
as
likely
to
propel
the
besom
into
the
kitchen
and
make
off
herself
as
to
enter
she
suddenly
stopped
now
door
in
hand
to
relate
some
news
i
say
mother
there
going
to
be
a
party
at
the
alhambra
a
party
at
the
alhambra
with
frost
and
snow
on
the
ground
ironically
repeated
carter
be
off
and
do
be
an
oaf
it
true
said
betsy
all
honey
fair
going
to
it
i
shall
go
too
and
mary
ann
cross
is
going
to
have
new
things
for
it
and
will
you
go
along
and
get
that
besom
cried
angry
carter
no
child
of
mine
shall
go
off
to
their
alhambras
catching
their
death
on
the
wet
grass
wet
grass
echoed
betsy
why
you
never
such
a
gaby
as
to
think
they
have
a
party
on
the
grass
it
is
to
be
in
the
big
room
and
there
to
be
a
fiddle
and
a
tam
bourine
never
came
carter
sent
the
wet
mop
flying
after
miss
betsy
and
the
young
lady
dexterously
evading
it
the
door
and
departed
a
couple
of
hours
later
timothy
carter
was
escorted
home
his
own
walking
none
of
the
steadiest
the
men
with
him
had
taken
more
than
timothy
but
it
was
that
weak
man
misfortune
to
be
overcome
by
a
little
you
will
allow
however
that
he
had
taken
enough
having
spent
his
shilling
and
gone
into
debt
besides
carter
received
him
well
i
am
rather
at
a
loss
to
describe
it
she
did
not
actually
beat
him
but
her
shrill
voice
might
be
heard
all
over
honey
fair
lavishing
hard
names
upon
helpless
tim
first
of
all
she
turned
out
his
pockets
the
shilling
was
all
gone
and
how
much
more
tacked
on
to
it
asked
she
wise
by
experience
and
timothy
was
just
able
to
understand
and
answer
he
felt
himself
as
a
lamb
in
the
fangs
of
a
wolf
eightpence
halfpenny
a
shilling
and
eightpence
halfpenny
chucked
away
in
drink
in
one
night
repeated
carter
she
gave
him
a
short
emphatic
shake
and
propelled
him
up
the
stairs
leaving
him
without
a
light
to
get
to
bed
as
he
could
she
had
still
some
hours
work
downstairs
in
the
shape
of
mending
clothes
but
it
never
once
occurred
to
carter
that
she
had
herself
to
thank
for
his
misdoings
with
a
tidy
room
and
a
cheerful
fire
to
receive
him
on
returning
from
his
day
work
timothy
carter
would
no
more
have
thought
of
the
than
you
or
i
should
and
if
as
did
charlotte
east
she
had
welcomed
him
with
a
good
supper
and
a
pleasant
tongue
poor
tim
in
his
gratitude
had
forsworn
for
ever
neither
when
mark
mason
staggered
home
and
wife
raved
at
and
quarrelled
with
him
to
the
further
edification
of
honey
fair
did
it
strike
that
lady
that
she
could
be
in
fault
as
carter
had
said
henrietta
mason
did
not
overburden
herself
with
work
of
any
sort
but
she
did
make
a
pretence
of
washing
her
four
children
in
a
bucket
on
a
saturday
night
and
her
kitchen
afterwards
the
ceremony
was
delayed
through
idleness
and
bad
management
to
the
least
propitious
part
of
the
evening
so
sure
as
she
had
the
bucket
before
the
fire
and
the
children
collected
round
it
one
in
one
just
out
roaring
to
be
dried
and
the
two
others
waiting
their
turn
for
the
water
all
of
them
stark
naked
for
mason
made
a
point
of
undressing
them
at
once
to
save
trouble
so
sure
i
say
as
these
ablutions
were
in
progress
the
children
frantically
crying
mason
boxing
storming
and
rubbing
and
the
kitchen
swimming
in
would
walk
the
father
words
invariably
ensued
a
short
sharp
quarrel
and
he
would
turn
out
again
for
the
nearest
where
he
was
welcomed
by
a
sociable
room
and
a
glowing
fire
can
any
one
be
surprised
that
it
should
be
so
you
must
not
think
these
cases
overdrawn
you
must
not
think
them
exceptional
cases
they
are
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
they
are
truthful
pictures
taken
from
what
honey
fair
was
then
i
very
much
fear
the
same
pictures
might
be
taken
from
some
places
still
chapter
xxii
brumm
sunday
shirt
but
there
something
to
say
yet
of
brumm
you
saw
her
turning
away
from
robert
east
door
saying
that
her
husband
andrew
had
promised
to
come
home
that
night
and
to
bring
his
wages
brumm
a
bad
manager
as
were
many
of
the
rest
would
probably
have
received
him
with
a
sloppy
kitchen
buckets
and
besoms
andrew
had
had
experience
of
this
and
disloyal
knight
that
he
was
allowed
himself
to
be
seduced
into
the
horned
ram
he
just
take
one
pint
and
a
pipe
he
said
to
his
conscience
and
be
home
in
time
for
his
wife
to
get
what
she
wanted
a
little
private
matter
of
his
own
would
call
him
away
early
pressed
for
a
sum
of
money
in
the
week
which
was
owing
to
his
club
and
not
possessing
it
he
had
put
his
sunday
coat
in
pledge
and
this
he
wanted
to
get
out
however
a
comrade
sitting
in
the
next
chair
to
him
at
the
horned
ram
had
to
get
coat
out
of
the
same
accommodating
receptacle
nothing
more
easy
than
for
him
to
bring
out
andrew
at
the
same
time
which
was
done
the
coat
on
the
back
of
his
chair
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
a
pint
of
good
ale
before
him
the
outer
world
was
as
nothing
to
andrew
brumm
at
ten
the
landlord
came
in
andrew
brumm
here
your
wife
wanting
to
see
you
now
andrew
was
not
a
bad
sort
of
man
by
any
means
but
he
had
a
great
antipathy
to
being
looked
after
a
joke
went
round
at
andrew
expense
for
if
there
was
one
thing
the
men
in
general
hated
more
than
another
it
was
that
their
wives
should
come
in
quest
of
them
to
the
brumm
received
a
sharp
reprimand
but
she
saw
that
he
was
as
she
expressed
it
getting
on
so
she
got
some
money
from
him
and
kept
her
scolding
for
another
opportunity
she
did
not
go
near
the
pawnbroker
to
get
her
irons
out
she
bought
a
bit
of
meat
and
what
else
she
wanted
and
returned
to
honey
fair
robert
east
was
closing
his
door
for
the
night
as
she
passed
it
has
brumm
come
home
he
asked
not
he
the
toper
he
is
stuck
fast
at
the
horned
ram
getting
in
for
it
nicely
i
have
been
after
him
for
some
money
have
you
got
your
irons
out
inquired
charlotte
coming
to
the
door
no
nor
nothing
else
and
there
pretty
near
half
the
kitchen
in
him
that
suffer
he
has
been
getting
out
his
own
coat
but
he
put
it
on
leastways
he
wo
without
a
clean
collar
and
shirt
and
let
him
fish
for
wait
till
comes
brumm
was
coat
in
returned
charlotte
surprised
that
it
was
him
as
goes
on
so
when
i
puts
a
thing
or
two
in
he
owed
some
money
at
his
club
and
he
went
and
put
his
coat
in
for
four
shillings
and
adam
thorneycroft
has
been
and
fetched
it
out
for
him
adam
thorneycroft
involuntarily
returned
charlotte
thorneycroft
coat
was
in
too
and
he
went
for
it
just
now
and
brumm
gave
him
the
ticket
to
get
out
his
smith
daughter
told
me
that
she
was
serving
with
her
mother
in
the
bar
is
adam
thorneycroft
at
the
horned
ram
still
that
he
is
side
by
side
with
brumm
a
nice
pair
of
charlotte
east
take
my
advice
do
you
have
anything
to
say
to
thorneycroft
a
woman
had
better
climb
up
to
the
top
of
her
topmost
chimbley
and
pitch
herself
off
head
foremost
than
marry
a
man
given
to
drink
charlotte
east
felt
vexed
at
the
allusion
vexed
that
her
name
should
be
coupled
openly
with
that
of
adam
thorneycroft
by
the
busy
tongues
of
honey
fair
that
an
attachment
existed
between
herself
and
adam
thorneycroft
was
true
but
she
did
not
wish
the
fact
to
become
too
apparent
to
others
latterly
she
had
been
schooling
her
heart
to
forget
him
for
he
was
taking
to
frequent
brumm
went
home
and
was
soon
followed
by
her
husband
he
was
not
much
the
worse
for
what
he
had
taken
he
was
a
little
brumm
reproached
him
with
it
and
a
wordy
war
ensued
they
arose
peaceably
in
the
morning
andrew
was
a
civil
man
and
but
for
horned
rams
would
have
been
a
pattern
to
three
parts
of
honey
fair
he
liked
to
be
dressed
well
on
sunday
and
to
attend
the
cathedral
with
his
two
children
he
was
very
fond
of
listening
to
the
chanting
brumm
as
was
the
custom
generally
with
the
wives
of
honey
fair
stayed
at
home
to
cook
the
dinner
andrew
was
accustomed
to
do
many
odd
jobs
on
the
sunday
morning
to
save
his
wife
trouble
he
cleaned
the
boots
and
shoes
brushed
his
clothes
filled
the
and
made
himself
useful
in
sundry
other
ways
all
this
done
they
sat
down
to
breakfast
with
the
two
children
the
unfortunate
jacky
less
black
than
he
had
been
the
previous
night
now
jacky
said
brumm
when
the
meal
was
over
get
yourself
ready
it
has
gone
ten
polly
too
it
too
cold
for
polly
this
morning
said
brumm
not
a
bit
o
the
walk
do
her
good
and
give
her
an
appetite
for
dinner
what
is
for
dinner
bell
i
asked
you
before
but
you
answer
it
ai
much
thanks
to
you
as
there
anything
retorted
brumm
who
rejoiced
in
the
aristocratic
name
of
arabella
you
plant
yourself
again
at
the
horned
ram
and
see
if
i
worries
myself
to
come
after
you
for
money
i
starve
on
the
sunday
first
i
ca
think
what
goes
of
your
money
returned
andrew
there
had
not
used
to
be
this
fuss
if
i
stopped
out
for
half
an
hour
on
the
saturday
night
with
my
wages
in
my
pocket
where
does
yours
go
to
it
goes
in
necessaries
shortly
answered
brumm
but
not
caring
for
reasons
of
her
own
to
pursue
this
particular
topic
she
turned
to
that
of
the
dinner
i
have
half
a
shoulder
of
mutton
and
i
going
to
take
it
to
the
with
a
batter
pudden
under
it
and
to
boil
the
taters
at
home
that
capital
returned
andrew
gently
rubbing
his
hands
nothing
nicer
than
baked
mutton
and
a
batter
pudden
jacky
brush
your
hair
well
it
as
rough
as
bristles
i
had
to
use
a
handful
of
soda
to
get
the
dye
out
said
brumm
soda
awful
stuff
for
making
the
hair
rough
andrew
slipped
out
to
the
honey
fair
barber
who
did
an
extensive
business
on
sunday
morning
to
be
shaved
when
he
returned
he
went
up
to
wash
and
dress
and
finally
uncovered
a
deal
box
where
he
was
accustomed
to
find
his
clean
shirt
with
all
brumm
faults
she
had
neat
ways
the
shirt
was
not
there
bell
where
my
clean
shirt
he
called
out
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
bell
brumm
had
been
listening
for
the
words
and
received
them
with
satisfaction
she
nodded
winked
and
went
through
a
little
pantomime
of
ecstasy
to
the
intense
delight
of
the
children
who
were
in
the
secret
and
nodded
and
winked
with
her
clean
shirt
she
called
back
again
as
if
not
understanding
my
sunday
shirt
ai
here
you
have
got
no
sunday
shirt
andrew
brumm
descended
the
stairs
in
consternation
no
sunday
shirt
he
repeated
no
shirt
nor
no
collar
nor
no
handkercher
coolly
affirmed
brumm
there
ai
none
ironed
they
be
all
in
the
wet
and
the
rough
wrapped
up
in
an
old
towel
jacky
and
polly
have
nothing
either
brumm
stared
considerably
why
what
the
meaning
of
that
the
irons
are
in
pawn
shortly
answered
brumm
you
know
you
never
came
home
with
the
money
so
i
could
get
out
another
wordy
war
andrew
protested
she
had
no
call
to
put
the
irons
in
any
such
place
she
impudently
retorted
that
she
should
put
the
house
in
if
she
liked
a
hundred
such
little
episodes
could
be
related
of
the
domestic
life
of
honey
fair
chapter
xxiii
the
bankes
on
the
monday
morning
a
troop
of
the
gloveress
girls
flocked
into
charlotte
east
they
were
taking
holiday
as
was
usual
with
them
on
mondays
charlotte
was
a
favourite
it
is
true
she
bothered
them
as
they
called
it
with
good
advice
but
they
liked
her
in
spite
of
it
charlotte
kitchen
was
always
tidy
and
peaceful
with
a
bright
fire
burning
in
it
other
kitchens
would
be
full
of
bustle
and
dirt
charlotte
never
let
them
hinder
her
she
worked
away
at
her
gloves
all
the
time
charlotte
was
a
that
is
she
sewed
the
fingers
together
and
put
in
the
thumbs
forgits
and
quirks
look
at
your
own
gloves
english
made
the
long
strips
running
up
inside
the
fingers
are
the
forgits
and
the
little
pieces
between
where
the
fingers
open
are
the
quirks
the
gloves
charlotte
was
occupied
with
now
were
of
a
very
dark
green
colour
almost
black
called
corbeau
in
the
trade
and
they
were
sewn
with
white
silk
charlotte
stitches
were
as
beautifully
regular
as
though
she
had
used
a
patent
machine
the
white
silk
and
the
fellow
glove
to
the
one
she
was
making
lay
inside
a
clean
white
handkerchief
doubled
upon
her
lap
other
gloves
equally
well
covered
were
in
a
basket
at
her
side
the
girls
had
come
in
noisily
with
flushed
cheeks
and
eager
eyes
charlotte
saw
that
something
was
exciting
them
they
liked
to
tell
her
of
their
little
difficulties
and
pleasures
betsy
carter
had
informed
her
mother
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
party
at
the
alhambra
if
you
remember
and
this
was
the
point
of
interest
these
alhambra
however
formidable
and
perhaps
suggestive
the
name
were
very
innocent
in
reality
they
belonged
to
a
quiet
roadside
inn
half
a
mile
from
the
town
and
comprised
a
large
garden
and
extensive
lawn
the
view
from
them
was
beautiful
and
many
a
party
from
helstonleigh
far
higher
in
the
scale
of
society
than
these
girls
would
go
there
in
summer
to
take
tea
and
enjoy
the
view
a
young
tall
handsome
girl
of
eighteen
had
drawn
her
chair
close
to
charlotte
she
was
the
of
mark
mason
and
had
her
home
with
him
and
his
wife
supporting
herself
after
a
fashion
by
her
work
but
she
was
always
in
debt
to
them
and
she
and
mark
did
not
get
along
well
together
she
wore
a
new
shawl
and
straw
bonnet
trimmed
with
blue
ribbons
and
her
dark
hair
fell
in
glossy
ringlets
as
was
the
fashion
then
two
other
girls
perched
themselves
on
a
table
they
were
sisters
amelia
and
mary
ann
cross
others
placed
themselves
where
they
could
somewhat
light
were
they
in
manner
these
girls
free
in
speech
nothing
farther
if
an
unhappy
girl
did
by
mischance
turn
out
badly
or
as
the
expressive
phrase
had
it
went
wrong
she
was
forthwith
shunned
and
shunned
for
ever
whatever
may
have
been
the
faults
and
failings
prevailing
in
honey
fair
this
sort
of
was
not
common
amongst
them
why
caroline
that
is
new
exclaimed
charlotte
east
alluding
to
the
shawl
caroline
mason
laughed
is
it
not
a
beauty
cried
she
and
it
may
be
remarked
that
in
speech
and
accent
she
was
superior
to
some
of
the
girls
charlotte
took
a
corner
of
it
in
her
hand
it
must
have
cost
a
pound
at
least
she
said
is
it
paid
for
again
caroline
laughed
never
you
mind
whether
it
paid
for
or
not
charlotte
you
wo
be
called
upon
for
the
money
for
it
as
i
told
my
yesterday
you
did
not
want
it
caroline
and
i
am
quite
sure
you
could
not
afford
it
your
winter
cloak
was
good
yet
it
is
so
bad
a
plan
getting
goods
on
credit
i
wish
those
bankeses
had
never
come
near
the
place
do
you
run
down
bankes
charlotte
east
interposed
eliza
tyrrett
a
very
plain
girl
with
an
expression
of
face
we
should
never
get
along
at
all
if
it
was
for
bankes
you
would
get
along
all
the
better
returned
charlotte
how
much
are
they
going
to
charge
you
for
this
shawl
caroline
caroline
and
eliza
tyrrett
exchanged
peculiar
glances
there
appeared
to
be
some
secret
between
them
connected
with
the
shawl
oh
a
pound
or
so
replied
caroline
what
was
it
eliza
eliza
tyrrett
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
and
caroline
echoed
it
charlotte
east
did
not
press
for
the
answer
but
she
did
press
the
matter
against
dealing
with
bankes
as
she
had
pressed
it
many
a
time
before
a
twelvemonth
ago
some
strangers
had
opened
a
shop
in
a
back
street
of
helstonleigh
brothers
of
the
name
of
bankes
they
professed
to
do
business
upon
credit
and
to
wait
upon
people
at
their
own
homes
after
the
fashion
of
hawkers
every
monday
would
one
of
them
appear
in
honey
fair
a
great
pack
of
goods
on
his
back
which
would
be
opened
for
inspection
at
each
house
caps
shawls
calico
flannel
and
finery
would
be
displayed
in
all
their
fascinations
now
you
who
are
reading
this
only
reflect
on
the
temptation
the
women
of
honey
fair
went
into
debt
and
it
was
three
parts
the
work
of
their
lives
to
keep
the
finery
and
the
system
from
the
knowledge
of
their
husbands
pay
us
so
much
weekly
bankes
would
say
and
the
women
did
so
it
seemed
like
getting
a
gown
for
nothing
but
bankes
were
found
to
be
strict
in
collecting
the
instalments
and
how
these
weekly
payments
told
upon
the
wages
i
will
leave
you
to
judge
some
would
have
many
shillings
to
pay
weekly
charlotte
east
and
a
few
more
prudent
ones
spoke
against
this
system
but
they
made
no
impression
the
temptation
was
too
great
charlotte
assumed
that
this
was
how
caroline
shawl
had
been
obtained
in
that
however
she
was
mistaken
charlotte
we
are
going
down
to
bankes
there
be
a
better
choice
in
his
shop
than
in
his
pack
you
have
heard
of
the
party
at
the
alhambra
well
it
is
to
be
next
monday
and
we
want
to
ask
you
what
we
shall
wear
what
would
you
advise
us
to
get
for
it
get
nothing
replied
charlotte
do
go
to
bankes
and
do
go
to
the
alhambra
the
whole
assembly
sat
in
wonder
with
open
eyes
not
go
to
the
party
echoed
pert
amelia
cross
what
next
charlotte
east
i
told
you
what
it
would
be
if
you
came
into
charlotte
east
said
eliza
tyrrett
a
sneer
on
her
countenance
i
am
not
against
proper
amusement
though
i
do
much
care
for
it
myself
said
charlotte
but
when
you
speak
of
going
to
a
party
at
the
alhambra
somehow
it
does
not
sound
respectable
the
girls
opened
their
eyes
wider
why
charlotte
what
harm
do
you
suppose
will
come
to
us
we
can
take
care
of
ourselves
i
hope
it
is
not
that
said
charlotte
of
course
you
can
still
it
does
not
sound
nice
it
is
like
going
to
a
you
ca
call
the
alhambra
anything
else
it
is
quite
different
this
from
going
there
to
have
tea
in
the
summer
but
that
not
it
i
say
if
you
go
to
it
you
would
be
running
into
debt
for
all
sorts
of
things
at
bankes
and
get
into
trouble
my
says
you
are
a
croaker
charlotte
and
she
right
cried
caroline
mason
with
charlotte
it
is
not
a
bit
of
use
your
talking
broke
in
mary
ann
cross
vehemently
we
shall
go
to
the
party
and
we
shall
buy
new
things
for
it
bankes
have
some
lovely
sarcenets
green
and
pink
and
lilac
and
me
and
mean
to
have
a
dress
apiece
off
with
a
pink
bow
in
front
and
a
white
collar
my
would
folks
stare
at
us
twelve
yards
each
it
would
take
and
they
are
a
yard
mary
ann
it
would
be
just
madness
there
be
the
making
the
lining
and
the
ribbon
five
or
shillings
each
they
would
cost
you
pray
do
how
you
do
reckon
things
up
charlotte
we
should
pay
off
weekly
we
have
time
afore
us
what
would
your
father
say
charlotte
just
hold
your
noise
about
father
quickly
returned
amelia
cross
in
a
hushed
and
altered
tone
you
know
we
do
tell
him
about
bankes
charlotte
found
she
might
as
well
have
talked
to
the
winds
the
girls
were
bent
upon
the
evening
pleasure
and
also
upon
the
smart
things
they
deemed
necessary
for
it
a
few
minutes
more
and
they
left
her
and
trooped
down
to
the
shop
of
the
bankes
charlotte
was
coming
home
that
evening
from
an
errand
to
the
town
when
she
met
adam
thorneycroft
he
was
somewhat
above
the
common
run
of
workmen
oh
is
it
you
charlotte
he
exclaimed
stopping
her
i
say
how
is
it
that
you
never
have
anything
to
say
to
me
now
i
have
told
you
why
adam
she
replied
you
have
told
me
a
pack
of
nonsense
i
would
lose
you
charlotte
to
be
made
king
of
england
when
once
we
are
married
you
shall
see
how
steady
i
be
i
will
not
enter
a
you
have
been
saying
that
you
will
not
for
these
twelve
months
past
adam
she
sadly
rejoined
and
had
her
face
been
visible
in
the
dark
night
he
would
have
seen
that
it
was
working
with
agitation
what
does
it
hurt
a
man
to
go
out
and
take
a
quiet
pipe
and
a
glass
after
his
work
over
everybody
does
it
everybody
does
not
but
i
do
not
wish
to
contend
it
seems
to
bring
you
no
conviction
half
the
miseries
around
us
in
honey
fair
arise
from
so
much
of
the
wages
being
wasted
at
the
i
know
what
you
would
say
that
the
wives
are
in
fault
as
well
so
they
are
i
do
not
believe
people
were
sent
into
the
world
to
live
as
so
many
of
us
live
nothing
but
scuffle
and
discomfort
and
i
may
almost
say
it
sinfulness
one
of
these
wretched
households
shall
never
be
mine
my
goodness
charlotte
how
seriously
you
speak
it
is
a
serious
subject
i
want
to
try
to
live
so
as
to
do
my
duty
by
myself
and
by
those
around
me
to
pass
my
days
in
peace
with
the
world
and
with
my
conscience
a
woman
beaten
down
cowed
by
all
sorts
of
ills
could
not
do
so
and
where
the
husband
is
unsteady
she
must
be
beaten
down
adam
you
know
it
is
not
with
a
willing
heart
i
give
you
up
but
i
am
forced
to
it
how
can
you
bring
yourself
to
say
this
to
me
he
rejoined
i
do
deny
that
it
is
hard
she
faintly
said
suppressing
with
difficulty
her
emotion
this
many
a
week
i
and
duty
have
been
having
a
conflict
with
each
other
but
duty
has
gained
the
mastery
i
knew
it
would
from
the
first
duty
be
smothered
interrupted
adam
thorneycroft
i
shall
think
you
a
born
natural
presently
charlotte
yes
i
know
i
ca
help
it
adam
we
should
never
pull
together
you
see
we
can
be
friends
in
future
if
you
like
nothing
more
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
for
a
parting
salutation
adam
hurt
and
angry
flung
it
from
him
and
turned
towards
helstonleigh
and
charlotte
continued
her
way
home
her
tears
dropping
in
the
dusky
night
chapter
xxiv
hard
to
bear
halliburton
struggled
on
a
struggle
my
reader
that
it
is
to
be
hoped
for
your
comfort
sake
you
have
never
experienced
and
never
will
she
had
learnt
the
stitch
for
the
back
of
the
gloves
and
lynn
supplied
her
with
a
machine
and
with
work
but
she
could
not
do
it
quickly
as
yet
though
it
was
a
hopeful
day
for
her
when
she
found
that
her
weekly
earnings
amounted
to
six
shillings
reece
paid
her
twenty
shillings
a
week
or
rather
dobbs
for
dobbs
was
of
that
jane
could
use
she
had
made
a
close
calculation
six
shillings
putting
by
fourteen
for
rent
and
taxes
her
taxes
were
very
light
part
of
them
being
paid
by
the
landlord
as
was
the
custom
with
some
houses
in
helstonleigh
but
for
this
the
rent
would
have
been
less
sorely
tempted
as
she
was
by
hunger
by
cold
almost
by
starvation
jane
was
resolute
in
leaving
the
fourteen
shillings
intact
she
had
suffered
too
much
from
of
the
last
rent
not
to
be
prepared
with
the
next
but
the
endurance
and
deprivation
how
great
they
were
and
she
suffered
far
more
for
her
children
than
for
herself
one
night
towards
the
middle
of
february
she
felt
very
downhearted
almost
as
if
she
could
not
struggle
on
much
longer
with
her
own
earnings
and
the
six
shillings
taken
from
reece
money
she
could
count
little
more
than
twelve
shillings
weekly
and
everything
had
to
be
found
out
of
it
coals
candles
washing
that
is
the
soap
firing
necessary
for
miss
betsy
carter
to
do
it
with
the
and
other
trifles
besides
food
you
will
not
therefore
be
surprised
to
hear
that
on
this
night
they
had
literally
nothing
in
the
house
but
part
of
a
loaf
of
bread
jane
was
resolute
in
one
thing
not
to
go
into
debt
buffle
would
have
given
credit
probably
other
shops
also
but
jane
believed
that
her
sole
chance
of
surmounting
the
struggle
eventually
was
by
keeping
debt
even
trifling
debt
away
they
had
this
morning
eaten
bread
for
breakfast
they
had
eaten
potatoes
and
salt
for
dinner
and
now
there
was
bread
again
all
jane
had
in
her
pocket
was
twopence
which
must
be
kept
for
milk
for
the
following
morning
so
they
were
drinking
water
now
they
were
round
the
fire
two
of
the
boys
kneeling
on
the
ground
to
get
the
better
blaze
thankful
they
had
a
fire
at
all
their
lessons
were
over
for
the
day
william
had
been
thoroughly
well
brought
on
by
his
father
in
greek
latin
euclid
and
in
english
generally
in
short
in
the
branches
necessary
to
a
good
education
frank
and
gar
were
forward
also
indeed
frank
for
his
age
was
a
very
good
latin
scholar
but
how
could
they
do
much
good
or
make
much
progress
by
themselves
william
helped
his
brothers
as
well
as
he
could
but
it
was
somewhat
profitless
work
and
jane
was
all
too
conscious
that
they
needed
to
be
at
school
altogether
her
heart
was
sore
within
her
another
thing
was
beginning
to
worry
her
a
fear
lest
her
brother
should
not
be
able
to
send
the
rent
she
had
fully
counted
upon
it
but
now
that
the
time
of
its
promised
receipt
was
at
hand
fears
and
doubts
arose
she
was
dwelling
on
it
now
now
as
she
sat
there
at
her
work
in
the
twilight
of
the
early
spring
evening
if
the
money
did
not
come
all
she
could
do
would
be
to
go
to
ashley
tell
him
of
her
ill
luck
and
that
he
must
take
the
things
at
last
they
must
turn
out
wanderers
on
the
wide
earth
no
a
plaintive
cry
interrupted
her
dream
and
recalled
her
to
reality
it
came
from
jane
who
was
seated
on
a
stool
her
head
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
she
is
crying
mamma
cried
quick
frank
and
janey
whispered
something
into
frank
ear
the
cry
deepening
into
sobs
mamma
she
crying
because
she
hungry
janey
dear
i
have
nothing
but
bread
you
know
it
could
you
eat
a
bit
i
want
something
else
sobbed
janey
some
meat
or
some
pudding
it
is
such
a
long
time
since
we
had
any
i
am
tired
of
bread
i
am
very
hungry
there
came
an
echoing
cry
from
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
gar
had
laid
his
head
down
on
the
floor
and
he
now
broke
out
sobbing
also
i
am
hungry
too
i
do
like
bread
any
more
than
janey
does
when
shall
we
have
something
nice
jane
gathered
them
to
her
one
in
each
arm
soothing
them
with
soft
caresses
her
heart
aching
her
own
sobs
choked
down
one
single
comfort
present
to
her
that
god
knew
what
she
had
to
bear
almost
she
began
to
fear
for
her
own
health
would
the
intense
anxiety
combined
with
the
want
of
sufficient
food
tell
upon
her
would
her
sleepless
nights
tell
upon
her
would
her
grief
for
the
loss
of
her
husband
a
grief
not
the
less
keenly
felt
because
she
did
not
parade
it
tell
upon
her
all
lay
in
the
future
she
rose
the
next
morning
early
to
her
work
she
always
had
to
rise
early
the
boys
and
jane
setting
the
breakfast
breakfast
putting
the
bread
upon
the
table
and
taking
in
the
milk
for
twopence
they
had
a
quart
of
skimmed
milk
and
were
glad
to
get
it
her
head
was
heavy
her
frame
hot
the
result
of
inward
fever
her
limbs
were
tired
before
the
day
began
worse
than
all
there
was
that
utter
weariness
of
mind
which
predisposes
a
sufferer
from
it
to
lie
down
and
die
this
will
never
do
thought
jane
i
bear
up
a
dispute
between
frank
and
gar
they
were
good
affectionate
boys
but
little
tempers
must
break
out
now
and
then
in
trying
to
settle
it
jane
burst
into
tears
it
put
an
end
to
the
fray
more
effectually
than
anything
else
could
have
done
the
boys
looked
blank
with
consternation
and
janey
burst
into
hysterical
sobs
do
jane
do
said
the
poor
mother
i
am
not
well
but
do
not
cry
i
am
not
well
either
sobbed
janey
it
hurts
me
here
and
here
she
put
her
hand
to
her
head
and
chest
and
jane
knew
that
she
was
weak
from
insufficiency
of
food
there
was
no
remedy
for
it
jane
only
wished
she
could
bear
for
them
all
some
time
after
breakfast
there
came
the
postman
knock
at
the
door
a
thickish
letter
twopence
to
pay
the
penny
postal
system
had
come
in
but
letters
were
not
so
universally
prepaid
then
as
they
are
now
jane
glanced
over
it
with
a
beating
heart
yes
it
was
her
handwriting
could
the
promised
rent
have
really
arrived
she
felt
sick
with
agitation
i
have
no
money
at
all
frank
ask
dobbs
if
she
will
lend
you
twopence
away
went
frank
in
his
quick
and
not
very
ceremonious
manner
penetrating
to
the
kitchen
where
dobbs
happened
to
be
dobbs
will
you
please
to
lend
mamma
twopence
it
is
for
a
letter
dobbs
indeed
who
retorted
that
functionary
in
wrath
i
am
dobbs
if
you
please
take
yourself
out
of
my
sight
till
you
can
learn
manners
wo
you
lend
it
the
postman
waiting
no
i
wo
returned
dobbs
back
ran
frank
she
wo
lend
it
mamma
she
says
i
was
rude
to
her
and
called
her
dobbs
oh
frank
but
the
postman
was
impatient
demanding
whether
he
was
to
be
kept
there
all
day
jane
was
fain
to
apply
to
dobbs
herself
and
procured
the
loan
then
she
ran
upstairs
with
the
letter
and
her
trembling
fingers
broke
the
seal
two
banknotes
for
each
fell
out
of
it
the
promised
loan
had
been
sixteen
pounds
the
rev
francis
tait
had
contrived
to
spare
four
pounds
more
before
jane
had
recovered
from
her
excitement
almost
before
a
breath
of
thanks
had
gone
up
from
her
heart
she
saw
ashley
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
going
towards
helstonleigh
being
in
no
state
to
weigh
her
actions
only
conscious
that
the
two
notes
lay
in
her
hand
actual
realities
she
threw
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
went
across
the
road
to
ashley
in
her
agitation
she
scarcely
knew
what
she
did
or
said
oh
sir
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
have
at
this
moment
received
the
money
for
the
back
rent
may
i
give
it
to
you
now
ashley
looked
at
her
in
surprise
a
scarlet
spot
shone
on
her
thin
cheeks
a
happy
excitement
was
spread
over
her
face
of
care
he
read
the
indications
plainly
that
she
was
an
eager
payer
but
no
willing
debtor
the
open
letter
in
her
hand
and
the
postman
opposite
told
the
tale
there
is
no
such
hurry
halliburton
he
said
smiling
i
can
not
give
you
a
receipt
here
you
can
send
it
to
me
she
said
i
would
rather
pay
you
than
mr
dare
she
held
out
the
notes
to
him
he
felt
in
his
pocket
whether
he
had
sufficient
change
found
he
had
and
handed
it
to
her
that
is
it
madam
four
sovereigns
thank
you
she
took
them
hesitatingly
but
did
not
close
her
hand
was
there
not
some
expense
incurred
when
when
that
man
was
put
in
not
for
you
to
pay
halliburton
he
pointedly
returned
i
hope
you
are
getting
pretty
well
through
your
troubles
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
she
turned
them
away
getting
pretty
well
through
her
troubles
thank
you
for
inquiring
she
meekly
said
i
shall
i
believe
have
the
quarter
rent
ready
in
march
when
it
falls
due
do
not
put
yourself
out
of
the
way
to
pay
it
he
replied
if
it
would
be
more
convenient
to
you
to
let
it
go
on
to
the
it
would
be
the
same
to
me
her
heart
rose
to
the
kindness
thank
you
ashley
thank
you
very
much
for
your
consideration
but
i
must
pay
as
i
go
on
if
i
possibly
can
patience
stood
at
her
gate
smiling
as
she
recrossed
the
road
she
had
seen
what
had
passed
thee
hast
good
news
i
see
but
thee
wert
in
a
hurry
to
pay
thy
rent
in
the
road
my
brother
has
sent
me
the
rent
and
four
pounds
over
patience
i
can
buy
bedside
carpets
now
patience
looked
pleased
with
all
thy
riches
thee
will
scarcely
thank
me
for
this
poor
three
and
sixpence
holding
out
the
silver
to
her
samuel
lynn
left
it
it
is
owing
thee
for
thy
work
jane
smiled
sadly
as
she
took
it
her
riches
how
is
anna
she
asked
she
is
nicely
thank
thee
and
is
gone
to
school
but
she
was
wilful
over
her
lessons
this
morning
farewell
i
am
glad
thee
art
so
far
out
of
thy
perplexities
very
far
indeed
and
a
great
relief
it
was
can
you
realize
these
troubles
of
halliburton
not
i
think
as
she
realized
them
we
pity
the
trials
and
endurance
of
the
poor
but
believe
me
they
are
as
nothing
compared
with
the
bitter
lot
of
reduced
gentlepeople
jane
had
not
been
brought
up
to
poverty
to
scanty
and
hard
fare
to
labour
to
humiliations
to
the
pain
of
debt
but
for
hope
and
some
of
us
know
how
strong
that
is
in
the
human
heart
and
for
that
better
hope
jane
never
could
have
gone
through
her
trials
her
physical
privations
alone
were
almost
too
hard
to
bear
can
you
wonder
that
an
unexpected
present
of
four
pounds
seemed
as
a
mine
of
wealth
chapter
xxv
incipient
vanity
but
four
pounds
however
large
a
sum
to
look
at
dwindles
down
sadly
in
the
spending
especially
when
bedside
carpets
and
boys
boots
new
ones
and
the
mending
of
old
ones
have
to
be
deducted
from
it
at
the
commencement
an
idea
had
for
some
time
been
looming
in
jane
mind
looming
ominously
for
she
did
not
like
to
speak
of
it
it
was
that
william
must
go
out
and
enter
upon
some
employment
by
which
a
little
weekly
money
might
be
added
to
their
stock
he
was
eager
enough
indulging
no
doubt
peculiar
visions
of
his
own
great
and
grand
but
these
jane
had
to
dispel
to
explain
that
for
young
boys
such
as
he
earning
money
implied
hard
work
his
face
flushed
scarlet
jane
drew
him
to
her
and
pressed
her
cheek
upon
his
there
would
be
no
real
disgrace
in
it
my
darling
no
work
in
itself
brings
disgrace
be
it
carrying
out
parcels
or
sweeping
out
a
shop
so
long
as
we
retain
our
refinement
of
tone
of
manner
our
courteous
conduct
one
to
the
other
we
shall
still
be
gentlepeople
let
us
work
at
what
we
may
william
i
think
it
is
your
to
help
in
our
need
yes
i
see
mamma
he
answered
i
will
try
and
do
it
anything
that
may
turn
up
jane
had
not
much
faith
in
things
turning
up
she
believed
that
they
must
be
sought
for
that
same
evening
she
went
into
lynn
with
the
view
to
asking
his
counsel
there
she
found
anna
in
trouble
the
cause
was
as
follows
patience
leaving
anna
alone
at
her
lessons
had
gone
into
the
kitchen
to
give
some
directions
to
grace
anna
seized
the
opportunity
to
take
a
little
recreation
not
that
it
was
greatly
needed
for
spoilt
child
that
she
was
she
had
merely
looked
at
her
books
with
vacant
eyes
not
having
in
reality
learned
a
single
word
first
of
all
off
went
her
cap
next
she
drew
from
her
pocket
a
small
mirror
about
the
size
of
a
piece
propping
this
against
her
books
on
the
table
before
her
so
that
the
rays
of
the
lamp
might
fall
upon
it
she
proceeded
to
admire
herself
and
twist
her
flowing
hair
round
her
pretty
fingers
to
make
a
shower
of
ringlets
sad
vanity
for
a
little
born
quakeress
but
it
must
be
owned
that
never
did
mirror
small
or
large
give
back
a
more
lovely
image
than
that
child
she
had
just
arranged
her
curls
and
was
contemplating
their
effect
to
her
entire
satisfaction
when
back
came
patience
sooner
than
she
was
expected
and
caught
the
young
lady
at
her
impromptu
toilette
what
with
the
curls
and
what
with
the
mirror
anna
did
not
know
which
to
hurry
away
first
thee
naughty
child
thee
naughty
naughty
child
what
is
to
become
of
thee
where
did
thee
get
this
anna
burst
into
tears
in
her
perplexity
she
said
she
had
found
the
mirror
that
thee
did
not
said
patience
calmly
i
ask
thee
where
thee
got
it
from
of
a
remarkably
pliant
nature
wavering
and
timid
anna
never
withstood
long
the
persistent
questioning
of
patience
amid
many
tears
the
truth
came
out
lucy
dixon
had
brought
it
to
school
in
her
workbox
it
was
a
doll
mirror
and
she
anna
had
given
her
sixpence
for
it
the
sixpence
that
thy
father
bestowed
upon
thee
yesterday
for
being
a
good
girl
retorted
patience
i
told
him
thee
would
likely
not
make
a
profitable
use
of
it
come
up
to
bed
with
thee
i
will
talk
to
thee
after
thee
are
in
it
of
all
things
anna
disliked
to
be
sent
to
bed
before
her
time
she
sobbed
expostulated
and
promised
all
sorts
of
amendment
for
the
future
patience
firm
and
quiet
would
have
carried
her
point
but
for
the
entrance
of
samuel
lynn
the
fault
was
related
to
him
by
patience
and
the
mirror
exhibited
anna
clung
around
him
in
a
storm
of
sobs
dear
father
dear
dear
father
do
thee
let
me
go
to
bed
let
me
sit
by
thee
while
thee
hast
thy
supper
patience
may
keep
the
glass
but
do
thee
let
me
go
it
was
quite
a
picture
the
child
clinging
there
with
her
crimsoned
cheeks
her
wet
eyelashes
and
her
soft
flowing
hair
samuel
lynn
albeit
a
man
not
given
to
demonstration
strained
her
to
him
with
a
loving
movement
perhaps
the
crime
of
looking
into
a
doll
glass
and
toying
with
her
hair
appeared
to
him
more
venial
than
it
did
to
patience
but
then
she
was
his
beloved
child
will
thee
transgress
again
anna
no
i
never
will
sobbed
anna
then
patience
will
suffer
thee
to
sit
up
this
once
but
thee
must
be
careful
he
placed
her
in
a
chair
close
to
him
patience
disapproving
very
much
but
saying
nothing
left
the
room
grace
appeared
with
the
and
a
message
that
patience
would
take
her
supper
in
the
kitchen
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
halliburton
came
in
she
told
the
quaker
that
she
had
come
to
consult
him
about
william
and
mentioned
her
intentions
to
tell
thee
the
truth
friend
i
have
marvelled
much
that
thee
did
not
under
thy
circumstances
seek
to
place
out
thy
eldest
son
was
the
answer
he
might
be
helping
thee
he
is
young
to
earn
anything
lynn
do
you
see
a
chance
of
my
getting
him
a
place
that
depends
friend
upon
the
sort
of
place
he
may
wish
for
i
could
help
him
to
a
place
but
it
is
one
that
may
not
accord
with
thy
notions
what
is
it
eagerly
asked
jane
it
is
in
thomas
ashley
manufactory
we
are
in
want
of
another
boy
and
the
master
told
me
i
had
better
inquire
for
one
what
would
he
have
to
do
asked
jane
and
what
would
he
earn
he
would
have
to
do
anything
he
may
be
directed
to
do
thy
son
is
older
than
are
our
boys
who
come
to
us
ordinarily
and
he
has
been
differently
brought
up
therefore
i
might
put
him
to
somewhat
better
employment
he
might
also
be
paid
a
trifle
more
they
sweep
and
dust
go
on
outdoor
errands
carry
messages
indoors
black
the
gloves
get
in
coal
and
they
earn
if
they
are
sharp
a
week
jane
heart
sank
within
her
but
thy
son
i
say
might
be
treated
somewhat
differently
not
that
he
must
be
above
doing
any
of
these
duties
should
he
be
put
to
them
i
can
assure
thee
friend
that
some
of
the
first
manufacturers
of
this
town
have
thus
begun
their
career
a
thoroughly
practical
knowledge
of
the
business
is
only
to
be
acquired
by
beginning
at
the
first
step
of
the
ladder
and
working
upwards
did
ashley
so
begin
she
could
scarcely
tell
why
she
asked
the
question
unless
it
was
that
a
feeling
came
over
her
that
if
ashley
had
done
these
things
she
would
not
mind
william
doing
them
no
friend
thomas
ashley
father
was
a
man
of
means
and
thomas
was
bred
up
a
classical
scholar
and
a
gentleman
he
has
never
taken
a
practical
part
in
the
working
of
the
business
i
do
that
for
him
his
labours
are
chiefly
confined
to
the
correspondence
and
the
keeping
of
the
books
his
father
wished
him
to
embrace
a
profession
rather
than
be
a
glove
manufacturer
but
thomas
preferred
to
succeed
his
father
if
thee
would
like
thy
son
to
enter
our
manufactory
i
will
try
him
jane
was
dubious
she
felt
quite
sure
that
william
would
not
like
it
he
has
been
thinking
of
a
or
a
lawyer
or
conveyancer
office
she
said
aloud
he
would
like
to
employ
his
time
in
writing
would
there
be
difficulty
in
getting
him
into
one
i
do
not
opine
a
lawyer
would
take
a
boy
of
his
size
they
require
their
writing
to
be
well
and
correctly
done
about
that
i
can
not
tell
thee
much
for
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
lawyers
he
can
inquire
jane
rose
she
stood
by
the
table
unconsciously
stroking
anna
flowing
curls
for
the
cap
had
never
been
replaced
and
samuel
lynn
found
no
fault
with
the
omission
i
will
speak
candidly
said
jane
i
fear
that
the
place
you
have
kindly
offered
me
would
not
be
liked
by
william
other
employments
writing
for
example
would
be
more
palatable
nevertheless
were
he
unable
to
obtain
anything
else
i
should
be
glad
to
accept
this
will
you
give
me
three
or
four
days
for
consideration
to
oblige
thee
i
will
friend
when
thomas
ashley
gives
orders
he
is
prompt
in
having
them
attended
to
and
he
spoke
as
i
have
informed
thee
about
a
fresh
boy
would
it
not
be
a
help
to
thee
friend
if
thee
got
thy
other
two
boys
into
the
school
attached
to
the
cathedral
but
i
have
no
interest
said
jane
i
hear
that
education
there
is
free
but
i
do
not
possess
the
slightest
chance
thee
may
get
a
chance
friend
there
nothing
like
trying
i
must
tell
thee
that
the
school
is
not
thought
highly
of
in
consequence
of
the
instruction
being
confined
exclusively
to
latin
and
greek
in
the
old
days
this
was
thought
enough
but
people
are
now
getting
more
enlightened
thomas
ashley
was
educated
there
but
he
had
a
private
tutor
at
home
for
the
branches
not
taught
at
the
college
he
had
also
masters
for
what
are
called
accomplishments
he
is
one
of
the
most
accomplished
men
of
the
day
few
are
so
thoroughly
and
comprehensively
educated
as
thomas
ashley
i
have
heard
say
thy
sons
have
begun
latin
it
might
be
a
help
to
them
if
they
could
get
in
i
should
desire
nothing
better
jane
breathlessly
rejoined
a
new
hope
penetrating
her
heart
i
have
heard
of
the
collegiate
school
here
but
until
very
recently
i
supposed
it
to
be
an
expensive
institution
no
friend
it
is
free
the
best
way
to
get
a
boy
in
is
by
making
interest
with
the
of
the
school
or
with
some
of
the
cathedral
clergy
a
recollection
of
peach
flashed
into
jane
mind
as
a
ray
of
light
she
bade
to
samuel
lynn
and
anna
and
to
patience
as
she
passed
the
kitchen
patience
had
been
crying
i
am
grieved
about
anna
she
explained
i
love
the
child
dearly
but
samuel
lynn
is
blind
to
her
faults
and
it
argues
badly
for
the
future
thee
can
not
imagine
half
her
vanity
i
fear
me
too
she
is
deceitful
i
wish
her
father
could
see
it
i
wish
he
would
indulge
her
less
and
correct
her
more
good
night
to
thee
before
concluding
the
chapter
it
may
as
well
be
mentioned
that
a
piece
of
good
fortune
about
this
time
befell
janey
she
found
favour
with
dobbs
how
it
came
about
perhaps
dobbs
could
not
herself
have
told
certainly
no
one
else
could
reece
had
got
into
the
habit
of
asking
jane
into
her
parlour
to
tea
she
was
a
old
lady
and
liked
the
child
dobbs
would
afterwards
be
at
work
generally
some
patching
and
mending
to
her
own
clothes
and
dobbs
though
she
would
not
acknowledge
it
to
herself
or
to
any
one
else
could
not
see
to
thread
her
needle
needle
in
one
hand
and
thread
in
the
other
she
would
poke
the
two
together
for
five
minutes
no
result
supervening
janey
hit
upon
the
plan
of
threading
her
a
needle
in
silence
whilst
dobbs
used
the
one
and
from
that
time
jane
kept
her
in
threaded
needles
whether
this
conciliated
dobbs
must
remain
a
mystery
but
she
took
a
liking
for
jane
and
the
liking
grew
into
love
henceforth
janey
wanted
for
nothing
while
the
others
starved
she
lived
on
the
fat
of
the
land
meat
and
pudding
fowls
and
pastry
whatever
dinner
in
the
parlour
might
consist
of
janey
had
her
share
of
it
and
a
full
share
too
at
first
halliburton
from
motives
of
delicacy
would
not
allow
jane
to
go
in
upon
which
dobbs
would
enter
boiling
over
with
indignation
red
with
the
exertion
of
cooking
and
triumphantly
bear
her
off
jane
spoke
seriously
to
reece
about
it
but
the
old
lady
declared
she
was
as
glad
to
have
the
child
as
dobbs
was
once
janey
came
to
a
standstill
over
some
apple
pudding
which
had
followed
upon
veal
cutlets
and
bacon
i
am
quite
full
said
she
more
plainly
than
politely
i
ca
eat
a
bit
more
may
i
give
this
piece
upon
my
plate
to
gar
no
you
may
not
snapped
dobbs
drowning
reece
words
that
she
might
give
it
and
welcome
how
dare
you
janey
you
know
that
boys
is
the
loadstones
of
my
life
dobbs
probably
used
the
word
loadstones
to
indicate
a
heavy
weight
she
seized
the
plate
of
pudding
and
finished
it
herself
lest
it
should
find
its
way
to
the
suggested
quarter
a
which
served
to
show
her
earnestness
in
the
cause
nothing
gave
dobbs
indigestion
like
apple
pudding
and
she
knew
she
should
be
a
martyr
for
hours
afterwards
thus
jane
at
least
suffered
from
henceforth
no
privations
and
for
this
halliburton
was
very
thankful
the
time
was
to
come
however
when
she
would
have
reason
to
be
more
so
chapter
xxvi
ashley
manufactory
the
happy
thought
suggested
by
samuel
lynn
jane
carried
out
she
applied
in
person
to
peach
and
he
obtained
an
immediate
entrance
for
frank
to
the
college
school
with
a
promise
for
gar
to
enter
at
the
of
march
he
was
perfectly
thunderstruck
when
he
found
that
his
old
friend
and
tutor
halliburton
was
dead
had
died
in
helstonleigh
and
that
he
had
buried
him
there
was
no
need
to
ask
him
twice
after
that
to
exert
his
interest
for
the
fatherless
children
the
school
i
have
told
you
what
it
was
many
years
ago
was
not
held
in
the
highest
repute
from
the
reason
spoken
of
by
samuel
lynn
vacancies
often
occurred
and
admission
was
easy
it
was
one
great
weight
off
jane
mind
william
was
not
so
fortunate
he
was
at
that
period
very
short
for
his
age
timid
in
manner
and
no
office
could
be
persuaded
to
take
him
nothing
in
the
least
congenial
to
him
presented
itself
or
could
be
found
and
the
result
was
that
he
resigned
himself
to
samuel
lynn
who
introduced
him
to
ashley
extensive
manufactory
to
be
initiated
by
degrees
into
all
the
mysteries
necessary
to
convert
a
skin
into
a
glove
and
although
his
interest
and
curiosity
were
excited
by
what
he
saw
he
pronounced
it
a
hateful
business
when
the
skins
came
in
from
the
they
were
washed
in
a
tub
of
cold
water
the
next
day
warm
water
mixed
with
yolks
of
eggs
was
poured
on
them
and
a
couple
of
men
to
the
knee
got
into
the
tub
and
danced
upon
them
skins
eggs
and
water
for
two
hours
then
they
were
spread
in
a
field
to
dry
till
they
were
as
hard
as
lantern
horn
then
they
were
staked
as
it
was
called
a
long
process
to
smooth
and
soften
them
to
the
stainers
next
to
be
stained
black
or
coloured
next
to
the
parers
to
have
the
loose
flesh
pared
from
the
inside
and
to
be
smoothed
again
with
all
this
being
done
on
the
outside
premises
then
they
came
inside
to
the
hands
of
one
of
the
foremen
who
sorted
and
marked
them
for
the
cutters
the
cutters
cut
the
skins
into
tranks
the
shape
of
the
hand
in
outline
with
the
separate
thumbs
and
forgits
and
sent
them
in
to
the
slitters
the
slitters
slit
the
four
fingers
and
the
thumbs
and
forgits
after
that
they
were
ready
for
the
women
three
different
women
you
may
remember
being
necessary
to
turn
out
each
glove
so
far
as
the
sewing
went
for
one
woman
rarely
worked
at
more
than
her
own
peculiar
branch
or
was
capable
of
working
at
it
this
done
and
back
in
the
manufactory
again
they
had
to
be
pulled
straight
and
padded
or
rubbed
a
process
by
which
they
were
brightened
if
black
gloves
the
seams
were
washed
over
with
a
black
dye
or
else
glazed
then
they
were
hung
up
to
dry
this
done
they
went
into
samuel
lynn
room
a
large
room
next
to
ashley
private
room
and
here
they
were
sorted
into
firsts
seconds
or
thirds
the
sorting
being
always
done
by
samuel
lynn
or
by
james
meeking
the
head
foreman
it
was
called
next
they
were
banded
round
with
a
paper
in
dozens
labelled
and
placed
in
small
boxes
ready
for
the
warehouses
in
london
a
great
deal
you
see
before
one
pair
of
gloves
could
be
turned
out
the
first
morning
that
william
went
at
six
with
samuel
lynn
he
was
ordered
to
light
the
fire
in
ashley
room
sweep
it
out
and
dust
it
first
of
all
sprinkling
the
floor
with
water
from
a
and
this
was
to
be
part
of
his
work
every
morning
at
present
samuel
lynn
giving
him
strict
charge
never
to
disturb
anything
on
ashley
desk
if
he
moved
things
to
dust
the
desk
he
was
to
lay
them
down
again
in
the
same
places
and
in
the
same
position
the
duster
consisted
of
some
leather
shreds
tied
up
into
a
knot
the
ends
loose
he
found
he
should
have
to
wait
on
ashley
and
samuel
lynn
bring
things
they
wanted
carry
messages
to
the
men
and
go
out
when
sent
a
pair
of
shears
which
he
could
not
manage
was
put
into
his
hand
and
he
had
to
cut
a
damaged
skin
useless
for
gloves
into
narrow
strips
standing
at
one
of
the
counters
in
samuel
lynn
room
william
wondered
whether
they
were
to
make
another
duster
but
he
found
they
were
used
in
the
manufactory
in
place
of
string
that
done
a
round
polished
stick
was
handed
to
him
tapered
at
either
end
which
he
had
to
pass
over
and
over
some
small
gloves
to
make
them
smooth
after
the
manner
of
a
cook
rolling
out
paste
for
a
pie
he
looked
with
dismay
at
the
two
young
errand
boys
of
the
establishment
who
were
black
with
dye
but
samuel
lynn
had
distinctly
told
him
that
he
would
not
be
expected
to
place
himself
on
their
level
the
rooms
were
for
the
most
part
very
light
one
or
two
sides
being
entirely
of
glass
on
the
evening
of
this
first
day
william
after
he
got
home
sat
there
in
sad
heaviness
his
mother
asked
how
he
liked
his
employment
and
he
returned
an
evasive
answer
presently
he
rose
to
go
to
bed
saying
he
had
a
headache
up
he
went
to
the
garret
and
flung
himself
down
on
the
mattress
sobbing
as
if
his
heart
would
break
jane
suspecting
something
of
this
followed
him
up
she
caught
him
in
her
arms
oh
my
darling
do
give
way
things
may
grow
brighter
after
a
time
it
is
such
a
dreadful
change
from
my
books
my
latin
and
greek
to
go
there
and
sweep
out
places
like
those
two
black
boys
he
said
hysterically
all
his
reticence
gone
my
dear
boy
my
darling
boy
i
know
not
how
to
reconcile
you
how
to
lessen
your
cares
your
experience
of
the
sorrow
of
life
is
beginning
early
you
are
hungry
too
i
am
always
hungry
answered
william
quite
unable
to
affect
concealment
in
that
hour
of
grief
i
heard
one
of
those
black
boys
say
he
had
boiled
pork
and
greens
for
dinner
i
did
so
envy
him
jane
checked
her
tears
they
were
rising
rebelliously
william
darling
your
lot
seems
just
now
very
dark
and
painful
but
it
might
be
worse
worse
he
echoed
in
surprise
how
could
it
be
worse
mamma
i
am
no
better
than
an
there
it
would
be
worse
william
if
you
were
one
of
those
poor
black
boys
unenlightened
no
wish
for
higher
things
content
to
remain
as
they
are
for
ever
but
that
could
never
be
he
urged
to
be
content
with
such
a
life
is
impossible
they
are
content
william
he
saw
the
drift
of
the
argument
yes
mamma
he
acknowledged
i
did
not
reflect
it
would
be
worse
if
i
were
quite
as
they
are
william
we
can
only
bear
our
difficulties
and
make
the
best
of
them
trusting
to
surmount
them
in
the
end
you
and
i
must
both
do
this
trust
is
different
from
hope
if
we
only
hope
we
may
lose
courage
but
if
we
fully
and
freely
we
can
not
patience
and
perseverance
endurance
and
trust
they
will
in
the
end
triumph
never
fear
if
i
feared
william
i
should
go
into
the
grave
with
despair
i
never
lose
my
trust
i
never
lose
my
conviction
firm
and
certain
that
god
is
watching
over
me
that
he
is
permitting
these
trials
for
some
wise
purpose
and
that
in
his
own
good
time
we
shall
be
brought
through
them
william
sobs
were
growing
lighter
the
time
may
come
when
we
shall
be
at
ease
again
continued
jane
when
we
shall
look
back
on
this
time
of
trial
and
be
thankful
that
we
did
bear
up
and
surmount
it
instead
of
fainting
under
the
burden
god
will
take
care
that
the
battle
is
not
too
hot
for
us
if
we
only
resign
ourselves
in
all
trust
to
do
the
best
the
future
is
grievously
dim
and
indistinct
as
the
guiding
light
in
your
father
dream
shone
only
on
one
step
at
a
time
so
can
i
see
only
one
step
before
me
what
step
is
that
he
asked
somewhat
eagerly
the
one
obvious
step
before
me
is
to
persevere
as
i
am
now
doing
to
try
and
retain
this
home
for
you
my
children
to
work
as
i
can
so
as
to
keep
you
around
me
i
must
strive
to
keep
you
together
and
you
must
help
me
bear
up
bravely
william
make
the
best
of
this
unpleasant
employment
and
its
mortifications
and
strive
to
overcome
your
repugnance
to
it
be
resolute
my
boy
in
doing
your
duty
in
it
because
it
is
your
duty
and
because
william
because
it
is
helping
your
mother
a
shadow
of
the
trust
so
firm
in
his
mother
heart
began
to
dawn
in
his
yes
it
is
my
duty
he
resolutely
said
i
will
try
to
do
it
to
hope
and
trust
jane
strained
him
to
her
were
you
and
i
to
give
way
now
darling
our
past
troubles
would
have
been
borne
for
nothing
let
us
i
repeat
look
forward
to
the
time
when
we
may
say
did
not
faint
we
battled
on
and
overcame
it
come
william
only
trust
to
god
she
quitted
him
leaving
him
to
reflection
and
resolve
scarcely
befitting
his
young
years
the
week
wore
on
to
its
close
on
the
saturday
night
william
his
face
flushed
held
out
four
shillings
to
his
mother
my
week
wages
mamma
jane
face
flushed
also
it
is
more
than
i
expected
william
she
said
i
fancied
you
would
have
three
i
think
the
master
fixed
the
sum
said
william
the
master
do
you
mean
mr
ashley
we
never
say
ashley
in
the
manufactory
we
say
master
lynn
was
paying
the
wages
i
heard
them
say
that
sometimes
lynn
paid
them
and
sometimes
james
meeking
those
two
black
boys
have
apiece
he
left
me
to
the
last
and
when
the
rest
were
gone
he
looked
at
me
and
took
up
three
shillings
then
he
seemed
to
hesitate
and
suddenly
he
locked
the
desk
went
into
the
master
room
and
spoke
with
him
he
came
back
in
a
minute
unlocked
the
desk
and
gave
me
four
shillings
hast
not
earned
it
he
said
i
think
thee
has
done
thy
best
thee
will
have
the
same
each
week
so
long
as
thee
does
so
jane
held
the
four
shillings
and
felt
that
she
was
growing
quite
rich
the
rest
crowded
round
to
look
ca
we
have
a
nice
dinner
with
it
said
one
i
think
we
must
said
jane
cheerily
a
nice
dinner
for
once
in
a
way
what
shall
it
be
roast
beef
called
out
frank
pork
with
crackling
suggested
janey
that
of
reece
yesterday
was
so
good
could
we
have
fowls
and
a
jam
pudding
asked
gar
jane
smiled
and
kissed
him
all
the
suggestions
were
beyond
her
purse
we
will
have
a
meat
pudding
she
said
that
best
and
the
children
cheerfully
acquiesced
they
had
implicit
faith
in
their
mother
they
knew
that
what
she
said
was
best
would
be
best
on
this
same
saturday
night
charlotte
east
was
returning
home
from
helstonleigh
an
errand
having
taken
her
thither
after
dark
almost
opposite
to
the
turning
to
honey
fair
a
lane
branched
off
leading
to
some
a
lane
green
and
pleasant
in
summer
but
bare
and
uninviting
now
two
people
turned
into
it
as
charlotte
looked
across
she
caught
only
a
glance
but
something
in
the
aspect
of
both
struck
upon
her
as
familiar
a
at
the
corner
shed
a
light
upon
the
spot
and
charlotte
suddenly
halted
and
stood
endeavouring
to
peer
further
but
they
were
soon
out
of
view
a
feeling
of
dismay
had
stolen
over
charlotte
she
hoped
she
was
mistaken
that
the
parties
were
not
those
she
had
fancied
and
she
slowly
continued
her
way
a
few
paces
more
she
turned
up
the
road
leading
to
honey
fair
and
found
herself
nearly
knocked
over
by
one
who
came
running
against
her
apparently
in
some
excitement
and
in
a
great
hurry
who
this
cried
the
voice
of
eliza
tyrrett
charlotte
east
i
declare
i
say
have
you
seen
anything
of
caroline
mason
charlotte
hesitated
she
hoped
she
had
not
seen
her
though
the
misgiving
was
upon
her
that
she
had
did
you
think
i
might
have
seen
her
she
returned
has
she
come
this
way
yes
i
expect
she
has
come
this
way
and
i
want
to
find
her
returned
eliza
tyrrett
vehemently
i
saw
her
making
off
out
of
honey
fair
and
i
saw
who
was
waiting
for
her
round
the
corner
i
knew
my
company
wanted
then
and
turned
into
dame
buffle
for
a
talk
and
there
i
found
that
madam
carry
has
been
telling
falsehoods
about
me
let
me
set
on
to
her
that
all
i
shall
say
what
she
wo
like
who
do
you
mean
was
waiting
for
her
inquired
charlotte
east
eliza
tyrrett
laughed
she
was
beginning
to
recover
her
temper
like
to
know
would
you
said
she
pertly
but
i
not
going
to
tell
tales
out
of
school
i
think
i
do
know
returned
charlotte
quietly
i
fear
i
do
do
you
i
thought
nobody
knew
nothing
about
it
but
me
it
has
been
going
on
this
ten
weeks
did
you
see
her
though
charlotte
i
thought
i
saw
her
but
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
she
was
with
with
some
one
she
has
no
business
to
be
with
oh
as
to
business
i
do
know
about
that
carelessly
answered
eliza
tyrrett
we
have
a
right
to
walk
with
anybody
we
like
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
for
you
returned
charlotte
there
no
in
it
cried
eliza
tyrrett
indignantly
i
never
saw
such
an
old
maid
as
you
are
charlotte
east
never
carry
mason
not
a
child
to
be
led
into
mischief
carry
very
foolish
was
charlotte
comment
oh
of
course
think
so
or
it
would
be
you
you
go
and
tell
upon
her
at
home
i
suppose
now
i
shall
tell
said
charlotte
folks
should
choose
their
acquaintances
in
their
own
class
of
life
if
they
want
things
to
turn
out
pleasantly
were
you
not
all
took
in
about
that
shawl
uttered
eliza
tyrrett
with
a
laugh
you
thought
she
went
in
debt
for
it
at
bankes
and
her
people
at
home
thought
so
het
mason
shrieked
on
at
her
like
anything
for
spending
money
on
her
back
while
she
owed
it
for
her
board
gave
her
that
eliza
he
did
law
where
the
harm
he
is
rich
enough
to
give
all
us
girls
in
honey
fair
one
apiece
and
who
be
the
worse
for
it
only
his
pocket
and
that
can
afford
it
i
wish
he
would
i
wish
you
would
not
talk
so
eliza
she
is
not
a
fit
companion
for
him
even
though
it
is
but
to
take
a
walk
and
she
ought
to
remember
that
she
is
not
he
wants
her
for
a
longer
companion
than
that
observed
eliza
tyrrett
that
is
if
he
tells
true
he
wants
her
to
marry
him
he
wants
her
to
marry
him
repeated
charlotte
speaking
the
words
in
sheer
amazement
who
says
so
he
does
i
should
hardly
think
he
can
be
in
earnest
though
eliza
tyrrett
we
can
not
be
speaking
of
the
same
person
cried
charlotte
feeling
bewildered
to
whom
have
you
been
alluding
to
the
same
that
you
have

chapter

the
forgotten
letter
it
was
the
last
day
of
march
and
five
in
the
afternoon
the
great
bell
had
rung
in
ashley
manufactory
the
signal
for
the
men
to
go
to
their
tea
scuffling
feet
echoed
to
it
from
all
parts
and
clattered
down
the
stairs
on
their
way
out
the
ground
floor
was
not
used
for
the
indoor
purposes
of
the
manufactory
the
business
being
carried
on
in
the
first
and
second
floors
the
first
flight
of
stairs
opened
into
what
was
called
the
a
very
large
apartment
through
this
on
the
right
branched
off
ashley
room
and
samuel
lynn
on
the
left
various
passages
led
to
other
rooms
and
the
upper
flight
of
stairs
was
opposite
to
the
the
running
completely
across
the
room
formed
a
barrier
between
the
and
the
entrance
staircase
the
men
flocked
into
the
passed
it
and
rattled
down
the
stairs
samuel
lynn
was
changing
his
coat
to
follow
and
william
halliburton
was
waiting
for
him
his
cap
on
for
he
walked
to
and
fro
with
the
quaker
when
ashley
voice
was
heard
from
his
room
the
as
it
was
frequently
called
william
it
was
usual
to
distinguish
the
boys
by
their
christian
name
only
the
men
by
both
their
christian
and
surnames
samuel
lynn
was
mr
lynn
did
thee
not
hear
the
master
calling
to
thee
william
had
certainly
heard
ashley
voice
but
it
was
so
unusual
to
be
called
by
it
that
he
had
paid
no
attention
he
had
very
little
communication
with
ashley
in
the
three
or
four
weeks
he
had
now
been
at
the
manufactory
ashley
had
not
spoken
to
him
a
dozen
words
he
hastened
into
the
taking
off
his
cap
in
the
presence
of
ashley
have
the
men
gone
to
tea
inquired
ashley
who
was
sealing
a
letter
yes
sir
replied
william
is
george
dance
gone
george
dance
was
an
apprentice
and
it
was
his
business
to
take
the
letters
to
the
post
they
are
all
gone
sir
except
lynn
and
james
meeking
who
is
waiting
to
lock
up
do
you
know
the
oh
yes
sir
it
is
in
west
street
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
take
this
letter
and
put
it
carefully
in
william
received
the
letter
from
ashley
and
dropped
it
into
his
jacket
pocket
it
was
addressed
to
bristol
the
london
were
already
made
up
ashley
put
on
his
hat
and
departed
followed
by
samuel
lynn
and
william
james
meeking
locked
up
as
it
was
his
invariable
business
to
do
and
carried
the
keys
into
his
own
house
he
inhabited
part
of
the
ground
floor
of
the
premises
are
thee
not
coming
home
with
me
this
evening
inquired
samuel
lynn
of
william
who
was
turning
off
the
opposite
way
no
the
master
has
given
me
a
letter
to
post
i
have
also
an
errand
to
do
for
my
mother
it
happened
things
do
happen
in
a
curious
sort
of
way
in
this
world
that
halliburton
had
desired
william
to
bring
her
in
some
candles
and
soap
at
and
to
purchase
them
at
lockett
shop
shop
was
rather
far
off
there
were
others
nearer
but
lockett
goods
were
of
the
best
quality
and
his
extensive
trade
enabled
him
to
sell
a
halfpenny
a
pound
cheaper
a
halfpenny
was
a
halfpenny
with
jane
then
william
went
on
his
way
walking
fast
as
he
was
passing
the
cathedral
he
came
into
contact
with
the
college
boys
then
just
let
out
of
school
it
was
the
first
day
that
gar
had
joined
he
had
received
his
appointment
according
to
promise
very
thankful
was
jane
in
spite
of
the
drawback
of
having
to
provide
them
with
linen
surplices
william
halted
to
see
if
he
could
discern
gar
amidst
the
throng
it
was
not
unnatural
that
he
should
look
for
him
one
of
the
boys
caught
sight
of
william
standing
there
it
was
cyril
dare
the
third
son
of
dare
a
boy
older
and
considerably
bigger
than
william
if
there
not
another
of
that
halliburton
lot
posted
there
cried
he
to
a
knot
of
those
around
perhaps
he
will
be
coming
amongst
us
next
because
we
have
not
enough
with
the
two
look
at
the
fellow
staring
at
us
he
is
a
common
at
ashley
frank
halliburton
who
little
as
he
was
wanted
neither
for
spirit
nor
pluck
heard
the
words
and
confronted
cyril
dare
that
is
my
brother
said
he
what
have
you
to
say
against
him
cyril
dare
cast
a
glance
of
scorn
on
frank
regarding
him
from
top
to
toe
you
audacious
young
puppy
i
say
he
is
a
snob
there
then
i
say
he
is
not
retorted
frank
you
are
one
yourself
for
saying
it
cyril
dare
big
enough
to
have
crushed
frank
to
death
speedily
had
him
on
the
ground
and
treated
him
not
very
mercifully
when
there
william
a
witness
to
this
but
not
understanding
it
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
to
protect
frank
all
he
saw
was
that
frank
was
down
and
two
big
boys
were
kicking
him
let
him
alone
cried
he
how
can
you
be
so
cowardly
as
to
attack
a
little
fellow
and
two
of
you
shame
now
if
there
was
one
earthly
thing
that
the
college
boys
would
not
brook
it
was
being
interfered
with
by
a
stranger
william
suffered
frank
treatment
had
been
nothing
to
what
he
had
to
submit
to
he
was
knocked
down
trampled
on
kicked
buffeted
abused
cyril
dare
being
the
chief
and
primary
aggressor
at
that
moment
the
came
in
view
and
the
boys
made
off
all
except
cyril
dare
reined
in
against
the
wall
at
a
few
yards
distance
was
a
lad
on
a
pony
he
had
delicately
expressive
features
large
soft
brown
eyes
a
complexion
too
bright
for
health
and
wavy
dark
hair
the
face
was
beautiful
but
two
upright
lines
were
indented
in
the
white
forehead
as
if
worn
there
by
pain
and
the
one
ungloved
hand
was
white
and
thin
he
was
as
old
as
william
within
a
year
but
slight
and
fragile
would
be
taken
to
be
much
younger
seeing
and
hearing
though
not
very
clearly
what
had
passed
he
touched
his
pony
and
rode
up
to
cyril
dare
the
latter
was
beginning
to
walk
away
leisurely
in
the
wake
of
his
companions
the
upper
boys
were
rather
fond
of
ignoring
the
presence
of
the
cyril
turned
at
hearing
himself
called
what
is
it
you
henry
ashley
where
did
you
spring
from
cyril
dare
was
the
answer
you
are
a
wretched
coward
cyril
dare
was
feeling
anger
yet
and
the
words
did
not
lessen
it
of
course
can
say
so
he
cried
you
know
that
you
can
say
what
you
like
with
impunity
one
ca
chastise
a
cripple
like
you
the
brilliant
painful
colour
flushed
into
the
face
of
henry
ashley
to
allude
openly
to
infirmity
such
as
this
is
as
iron
entering
into
the
soul
upon
a
sensitive
timid
refined
nature
and
those
suffering
from
this
sort
of
affliction
are
nearly
sure
to
possess
that
nature
it
falls
with
a
bitterness
that
can
neither
be
conceived
by
others
nor
spoken
of
by
themselves
henry
ashley
braved
it
out
a
coward
and
a
double
coward
he
repeated
looking
cyril
dare
full
in
the
face
whilst
the
transparent
flush
grew
hotter
on
his
own
you
struck
a
young
boy
down
and
then
kicked
him
and
for
nothing
but
that
he
stood
up
like
a
trump
at
your
abuse
of
his
brother
you
could
hear
returned
cyril
dare
roughly
i
heard
enough
i
say
that
you
are
a
coward
chut
they
are
snobs
i
do
care
if
they
are
it
does
not
make
you
less
a
coward
and
you
be
one
as
long
as
you
live
if
i
had
my
strength
serve
you
out
as
you
served
them
out
ah
but
you
have
not
your
strength
you
know
mocked
cyril
and
as
you
seem
to
be
going
into
one
of
your
heroic
fits
i
shall
make
a
start
for
i
have
no
time
to
waste
on
them
he
tore
away
henry
ashley
turned
his
pony
and
addressed
william
both
boys
had
spoken
rapidly
so
that
scarcely
a
minute
had
passed
and
william
had
only
just
risen
from
the
ground
he
leaned
against
the
wall
giddy
as
he
wiped
the
blood
from
his
face
are
you
much
hurt
asked
henry
kindly
his
large
dark
eyes
full
of
sympathy
no
thank
you
it
is
nothing
replied
william
he
is
a
great
coward
though
whoever
he
is
it
is
cyril
dare
called
out
frank
yes
it
is
cyril
dare
continued
henry
ashley
i
have
been
telling
him
what
a
coward
he
is
i
am
ashamed
of
him
he
is
my
cousin
in
a
remote
degree
i
am
glad
you
are
not
hurt
henry
ashley
rode
away
towards
his
home
frank
followed
in
the
same
direction
as
did
gar
who
now
came
in
view
william
proceeded
up
the
town
he
was
a
little
hurt
although
he
had
disowned
it
to
henry
ashley
his
head
felt
light
his
arms
ached
perhaps
the
sensation
of
giddiness
was
as
much
from
the
want
of
food
as
anything
he
purchased
what
was
required
for
his
mother
and
then
made
the
best
of
his
way
home
again
ashley
letter
had
gone
clean
out
of
his
head
frank
in
the
manner
usual
with
boys
carried
home
so
exaggerated
a
story
of
william
damages
that
jane
expected
to
see
him
arrive
samuel
lynn
heard
of
it
and
said
william
might
stop
at
home
that
evening
it
has
never
been
mentioned
that
his
hours
were
from
six
till
eight
in
the
morning
from
nine
till
one
from
two
till
five
and
from
six
till
eight
these
were
lynn
hours
and
william
was
allowed
to
keep
the
same
the
men
had
less
allowed
for
breakfast
and
tea
william
was
glad
of
the
rest
after
his
battle
and
the
evening
passed
on
it
was
growing
late
almost
bedtime
when
suddenly
there
flashed
into
his
memory
ashley
letter
he
put
his
hand
into
his
there
it
lay
snug
and
safe
with
a
few
words
of
explanation
to
his
mother
so
hasty
and
incoherent
that
she
did
not
understand
a
syllable
he
snatched
his
cap
and
flew
away
in
the
direction
of
the
town
boys
have
good
legs
and
lungs
and
william
scarcely
slackened
speed
until
he
gained
the
not
far
short
of
a
mile
dropping
the
letter
into
the
box
he
stood
against
the
wall
to
recover
breath
a
clerk
was
standing
at
the
door
whistling
and
at
that
moment
a
gentleman
apparently
a
stranger
came
out
of
a
neighbouring
hotel
a
letter
in
hand
this
is
the
head
i
believe
said
he
to
the
clerk
yes
am
i
in
time
to
post
a
letter
for
bristol
no
sir
the
bags
for
the
bristol
mail
are
made
up
it
will
be
through
the
town
directly
william
heard
this
with
consternation
if
it
was
too
late
for
this
gentleman
letter
it
was
too
late
for
ashley
he
said
nothing
to
any
one
that
night
but
he
lay
awake
thinking
over
what
might
be
the
consequences
of
his
forgetfulness
the
letter
might
be
one
of
importance
ashley
might
discharge
him
for
his
neglect
and
the
weekly
four
shillings
had
grown
into
an
absolute
necessity
william
possessed
a
large
share
of
conscientiousness
and
the
fault
disturbed
him
much
when
he
came
down
at
six
he
found
his
mother
up
and
at
work
he
gave
her
the
history
of
what
had
happened
what
can
be
done
he
asked
nay
william
put
that
question
to
yourself
what
ought
you
to
do
reflect
a
moment
i
suppose
i
ought
to
tell
mr
ashley
do
not
say
suppose
my
dear
you
must
tell
him
yes
i
know
i
must
he
acknowledged
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
all
night
but
i
do
like
to
ah
child
we
have
many
things
to
do
that
we
like
but
the
first
trouble
is
always
the
worst
look
it
fully
in
the
face
and
it
will
melt
away
there
is
no
help
for
it
in
this
matter
william
your
duty
is
plain
there
lynn
looking
out
for
you
william
went
out
heavy
with
the
thought
of
the
task
he
should
have
to
accomplish
after
breakfast
he
knew
that
he
must
do
it
it
was
a
duty
as
his
mother
had
said
and
she
had
fully
impressed
upon
them
all
from
their
infancy
the
necessity
of
looking
out
for
their
duty
and
doing
it
whether
in
great
things
or
in
small
ashley
entered
the
manufactory
that
morning
at
his
usual
hour
nine
he
opened
and
read
his
letters
and
then
was
engaged
for
some
time
with
samuel
lynn
by
ten
the
was
clear
ashley
was
alone
in
it
and
william
knew
that
his
time
was
come
he
went
in
and
approached
ashley
desk
ashley
who
was
writing
looked
up
what
is
it
william
face
grew
red
and
white
by
turns
he
was
of
a
remarkably
sensitive
nature
and
these
sensitive
natures
can
not
help
betraying
their
inward
emotion
try
as
he
would
he
could
not
get
a
word
out
ashley
was
surprised
what
is
the
matter
he
wonderingly
asked
if
you
please
sir
i
am
very
sorry
it
is
about
the
letter
he
stammered
and
was
unable
to
get
any
further
the
letter
repeated
ashley
what
letter
not
the
letter
i
gave
you
to
post
i
forgot
it
sir
and
william
own
voice
sounded
to
his
ear
painfully
clear
forgot
to
post
it
that
was
unpardonably
careless
where
is
the
letter
i
forgot
it
sir
until
night
and
then
i
ran
to
the
and
put
it
in
afterwards
i
heard
the
clerk
say
that
the
bristol
bags
were
made
up
so
of
course
it
would
not
go
i
am
very
sorry
sir
he
repeated
after
a
pause
how
came
you
to
forget
it
you
ought
to
have
gone
direct
from
here
and
posted
it
so
i
did
go
sir
that
is
i
was
going
but
but
what
returned
ashley
for
william
had
made
a
dead
standstill
the
college
boys
set
on
me
sir
they
were
my
brother
and
i
interfered
and
then
they
turned
upon
me
it
made
me
forget
the
letter
it
was
you
who
got
into
an
affray
with
the
college
boys
was
it
cried
ashley
he
had
heard
his
son
version
of
the
affair
without
suspecting
that
it
related
to
william
william
waited
by
the
desk
if
you
please
sir
was
it
of
great
consequence
it
might
have
been
do
not
be
guilty
of
such
carelessness
again
i
will
try
not
sir
ashley
looked
down
at
his
writing
william
waited
he
did
not
suppose
it
was
over
and
he
wanted
to
know
the
worst
why
do
you
stay
asked
ashley
i
hope
you
will
not
turn
me
away
for
it
sir
he
said
his
colour
changing
again
well
not
this
time
replied
ashley
smiling
to
himself
but
tell
you
what
i
should
have
felt
inclined
to
turn
you
away
for
he
added
concealing
the
fact
from
me
whatever
fault
omission
or
accident
you
may
commit
always
acknowledge
it
at
once
it
is
the
best
plan
and
the
easiest
you
may
go
back
to
your
work
now
william
left
the
room
with
a
lighter
step
ashley
looked
after
him
that
an
honest
lad
thought
he
he
might
just
as
well
have
kept
it
from
me
calculating
on
the
chances
of
its
not
coming
out
many
boys
would
have
done
so
he
has
been
brought
up
in
a
good
school
before
the
day
was
over
william
came
again
into
contact
with
ashley
that
gentleman
sometimes
made
his
appearance
in
the
manufactory
in
an
evening
not
always
he
did
not
on
this
one
when
samuel
lynn
and
william
entered
it
on
their
return
from
tea
a
gentleman
was
waiting
in
the
on
business
samuel
lynn
who
was
on
such
occasions
ashley
came
out
of
the
presently
with
a
note
in
his
hand
thee
put
on
thy
cap
and
take
this
to
the
master
house
ask
to
see
him
and
say
that
i
wait
for
an
answer
william
ran
off
with
the
note
no
fear
of
his
forgetting
this
time
it
was
addressed
in
the
plain
form
used
by
the
quakers
thomas
ashley
and
could
william
have
looked
inside
he
would
have
seen
instead
of
the
complimentary
sir
that
the
commencement
was
respected
friend
he
observed
his
mother
sitting
close
at
her
window
to
catch
what
remained
of
the
declining
light
and
nodded
to
her
as
he
passed
can
i
see
mr
ashley
he
inquired
when
he
reached
the
house
the
servant
replied
that
he
could
he
left
william
in
the
hall
and
opened
the
door
of
the
a
handsome
room
of
lofty
proportions
ashley
was
slowly
pacing
it
to
and
fro
whilst
henry
sat
at
a
table
preparing
his
latin
exercise
for
his
tutor
it
was
ashley
custom
to
help
henry
with
his
latin
easing
difficulties
to
him
by
explanation
henry
was
very
backward
with
his
classics
he
had
not
yet
begun
greek
his
own
private
hope
was
that
he
never
should
begin
it
his
sufferings
rendered
learning
always
irksome
sometimes
unbearable
the
same
cause
frequently
made
him
irritable
an
irritation
that
could
not
be
checked
as
it
would
have
been
in
a
more
healthy
boy
the
servant
told
his
master
he
was
wanted
and
ashley
looked
into
the
hall
oh
is
it
you
william
he
said
come
in
william
advanced
lynn
said
i
was
to
see
yourself
sir
and
to
say
that
he
waited
for
an
answer
ashley
opened
the
note
and
read
it
by
the
lamp
on
henry
table
it
was
not
dark
outside
and
the
chandelier
was
not
lighted
but
lamp
was
sit
down
said
ashley
to
william
and
left
the
room
note
in
hand
william
felt
it
was
something
ashley
recognizing
a
difference
between
him
and
those
black
boys
in
the
manufactory
they
would
scarcely
have
been
told
to
sit
in
the
hall
william
sat
down
on
the
first
chair
at
hand
henry
ashley
looked
at
him
and
he
recognized
him
as
the
boy
who
had
been
maltreated
by
the
college
boys
on
the
previous
day
but
henry
was
in
no
mood
to
be
sociable
or
even
condescending
he
never
was
when
over
his
lessons
his
hip
was
giving
him
pain
and
his
exercise
was
making
him
fractious
there
it
always
the
case
another
five
minutes
and
i
should
have
finished
this
horrid
exercise
papa
is
sure
to
go
away
or
be
called
away
when
he
helping
me
it
a
shame
ashley
opened
the
door
at
this
juncture
and
looked
into
the
room
i
thought
your
papa
was
here
henry
no
he
is
not
here
he
has
gone
to
his
study
and
i
am
stuck
fast
some
blessed
note
has
come
which
he
has
to
attend
to
and
i
do
know
whether
this
word
should
be
put
in
the
ablative
or
the
dative
i
run
the
pen
through
it
oh
henry
henry
do
not
be
so
impatient
ashley
shut
the
door
again
and
henry
continued
to
worry
himself
making
no
progress
except
in
fretfulness
at
length
william
approached
him
will
you
let
me
help
you
surprise
brought
henry
grumbling
to
a
standstill
you
he
exclaimed
do
you
know
anything
of
latin
i
am
very
much
farther
in
it
than
what
you
are
doing
my
brother
gar
is
as
far
as
that
shall
i
help
you
you
have
put
that
wrong
it
ought
to
be
in
the
accusative
well
if
you
can
help
me
you
may
for
i
want
to
get
it
over
said
henry
with
a
doubting
stress
upon
the
can
you
can
sit
down
if
you
wish
to
he
patronizingly
added
thank
you
i
do
care
about
sitting
down
replied
william
beginning
at
once
upon
his
task
the
two
boys
were
soon
deep
in
the
exercise
william
not
doing
it
but
rendering
it
easy
to
henry
in
the
same
manner
that
halliburton
when
he
was
at
that
stage
used
to
make
it
clear
to
him
i
say
cried
henry
who
taught
you
papa
he
gave
a
great
deal
of
time
to
me
and
that
got
me
on
i
can
see
a
wrong
word
there
added
william
casting
his
eyes
to
the
top
of
the
page
it
ought
to
be
in
the
vocative
and
you
have
put
it
in
the
dative
you
are
mistaken
then
papa
told
me
that
and
he
is
not
likely
to
be
wrong
papa
is
one
of
the
best
classical
scholars
of
the
day
although
he
is
a
manufacturer
added
henry
who
through
his
relatives
the
dares
had
been
infected
with
a
contempt
for
business
it
should
be
in
the
vocative
repeated
william
i
sha
alter
it
the
idea
of
your
finding
fault
with
latin
let
us
get
on
what
case
is
this
the
last
word
of
the
exercise
was
being
written
when
ashley
opened
the
door
and
called
to
william
he
gave
him
a
note
for
lynn
and
william
departed
ashley
returned
to
complete
the
interrupted
exercise
i
say
papa
that
fellow
knows
latin
began
henry
what
fellow
returned
ashley
why
that
chap
of
yours
who
has
been
here
he
has
helped
me
through
my
exercise
not
doing
it
for
me
you
need
not
be
afraid
but
explaining
to
me
how
to
do
it
he
made
it
easier
to
me
than
you
do
papa
ashley
took
the
book
in
his
hand
and
saw
that
it
was
correct
he
knew
henry
could
not
or
would
not
have
made
it
so
himself
henry
continued
he
said
his
papa
used
to
explain
it
to
him
fancy
one
of
your
manufactory
saying
you
must
not
class
him
with
the
ordinary
henry
the
boy
has
been
as
well
brought
up
as
you
have
i
thought
so
for
he
has
impudence
about
him
was
master
retort
was
he
impudent
to
you
to
me
oh
no
he
is
as
civil
a
fellow
as
ever
i
spoke
to
indeed
but
for
remembering
who
he
was
i
should
call
him
a
gentlemanly
fellow
whilst
he
was
telling
me
i
forgot
who
he
was
and
talked
to
him
as
an
equal
and
talked
to
me
as
one
i
call
him
impudent
because
he
found
fault
with
your
latin
indeed
returned
ashley
an
amused
smile
parting
his
lips
he
says
this
word
wrong
that
it
ought
to
be
in
the
vocative
case
so
it
ought
to
be
assented
ashley
casting
his
eyes
on
the
word
to
which
henry
pointed
you
told
me
the
dative
papa
that
i
certainly
did
not
henry
the
mistake
must
have
been
your
own
he
persisted
that
it
was
wrong
although
i
told
him
it
was
your
latin
papa
it
is
the
same
boy
who
had
the
row
yesterday
with
cyril
dare
what
a
pity
it
is
though
that
a
fellow
so
well
up
in
his
latin
should
be
shut
up
in
a
manufactory
the
only
is
that
he
is
in
it
too
early
was
the
response
of
ashley
his
latin
would
not
be
any
detriment
to
his
being
in
a
manufactory
or
the
manufactory
to
his
latin
i
am
a
manufacturer
myself
henry
you
appear
to
ignore
that
sometimes
the
dares
go
on
so
they
din
it
into
my
ears
that
a
manufacturer
can
not
be
a
gentleman
i
shall
cause
you
to
drop
the
acquaintance
of
the
dares
if
you
allow
yourself
to
listen
to
all
the
false
and
foolish
notions
they
may
give
utterance
to
cyril
dare
will
probably
go
into
a
manufactory
himself
henry
looked
up
curiously
i
do
think
so
papa
i
do
returned
ashley
in
a
significant
tone
henry
was
surprised
at
the
news
he
knew
his
father
never
advanced
a
decided
opinion
unless
he
had
good
grounds
for
it
he
burst
into
a
laugh
the
notion
of
cyril
dare
going
into
a
manufactory
tickled
his
fancy
amazingly
part
the
second
chapter
i
a
suggested
fear
one
morning
towards
the
middle
of
april
halliburton
went
up
to
ashley
she
had
brought
him
the
quarter
rent
will
you
allow
me
to
pay
it
to
yourself
sir
now
and
in
future
she
asked
i
feel
an
unconquerable
aversion
to
having
further
dealings
with
mr
dare
i
can
understand
that
you
should
have
said
ashley
yes
you
can
pay
it
to
me
halliburton
always
remembering
you
know
that
i
am
in
no
hurry
for
it
he
added
with
a
smile
thank
you
you
are
very
kind
but
i
must
pay
as
i
go
on
he
wrote
the
receipt
and
handed
it
to
her
i
hope
you
are
satisfied
with
william
she
said
as
she
folded
it
up
quite
so
i
believe
he
gives
satisfaction
to
lynn
i
have
little
to
do
with
him
myself
lynn
tells
me
that
he
finds
him
a
remarkably
truthful
boy
you
will
always
find
him
that
said
jane
he
is
getting
more
reconciled
to
the
manufactory
than
he
was
at
first
did
he
not
like
it
at
first
no
he
did
not
he
was
disappointed
altogether
he
had
hoped
to
find
some
employment
more
suited
to
the
way
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
he
can
not
divest
himself
of
the
idea
that
he
is
looked
upon
as
on
a
level
with
the
poor
of
your
establishment
and
therefore
has
lost
caste
he
had
wished
also
to
be
in
some
office
a
lawyer
for
instance
where
the
hours
for
leaving
are
early
so
that
he
might
have
had
the
evening
for
his
studies
but
he
is
growing
more
reconciled
to
the
inevitable
i
suppose
he
wished
to
continue
his
studies
he
did
so
naturally
the
foundation
of
an
advanced
education
has
been
laid
and
he
expected
it
was
to
go
on
to
completion
his
brothers
are
now
in
the
college
school
occupied
all
day
long
with
their
studies
and
of
course
william
feels
the
difference
he
gets
to
his
books
for
an
hour
when
he
returns
home
in
an
evening
but
he
is
weary
and
does
not
do
much
good
he
appears
to
be
a
more
persevering
thoughtful
boy
than
are
some
remarked
ashley
very
thoughtful
very
persevering
it
has
been
the
labour
of
my
life
ashley
to
foster
good
seed
in
my
children
to
reason
with
them
to
make
them
my
companions
they
have
been
endowed
i
am
thankful
to
say
with
admirable
qualities
of
head
and
heart
and
i
have
striven
unweariedly
to
nourish
the
good
in
them
it
is
not
often
that
boys
are
brought
into
contact
with
sorrow
so
early
as
they
their
father
death
and
my
adverse
circumstances
have
been
real
trials
they
must
have
been
rejoined
ashley
while
others
of
their
age
think
only
of
play
she
continued
my
boys
have
been
obliged
to
learn
the
sad
experiences
of
life
and
it
has
given
them
a
thought
a
care
beyond
their
years
there
is
no
necessity
to
frank
and
edgar
apply
to
their
lessons
unremittingly
they
do
it
of
their
own
accord
with
their
whole
abilities
knowing
that
education
is
the
only
advantage
they
can
possess
the
one
chance
of
their
getting
on
in
the
world
had
william
been
a
boy
of
a
different
disposition
less
tractable
less
reflective
less
conscientious
i
might
have
found
some
difficulty
in
inducing
him
to
work
as
he
is
doing
does
he
complain
inquired
ashley
oh
no
sir
he
feels
that
it
is
his
duty
to
work
to
assist
as
far
as
he
can
and
he
does
it
without
complaining
i
see
that
he
can
not
help
feeling
it
he
would
like
to
be
in
the
college
with
his
brothers
but
i
cheer
him
up
and
tell
him
it
may
all
turn
out
for
the
best
perhaps
it
will
she
rose
as
she
spoke
ashley
shook
hands
with
her
and
attended
her
through
the
hall
your
sons
deserve
to
get
on
halliburton
and
i
hope
they
will
do
so
it
is
an
admirable
promise
for
the
future
man
when
a
boy
displays
thought
and
mamma
suddenly
exclaimed
janey
as
they
sat
at
breakfast
the
morning
after
this
do
you
remember
what
is
it
is
my
birthday
jane
had
remembered
it
she
had
been
almost
in
hopes
that
the
child
would
not
remember
it
one
year
ago
that
day
the
first
glimpse
of
the
shadow
so
soon
to
fall
upon
them
had
shown
itself
what
a
change
the
contrast
between
last
year
and
this
was
almost
incredible
then
they
had
been
in
possession
of
a
good
home
were
living
in
prosperity
in
apparent
security
now
jane
heart
turned
sick
at
the
thought
only
one
short
year
yes
janey
dear
she
replied
in
sadly
subdued
tones
i
did
not
forget
it
i
a
double
knock
at
the
door
interrupted
what
she
would
have
further
said
they
heard
dobbs
answer
it
visitors
were
chiefly
for
reece
who
should
be
standing
there
but
samuel
lynn
he
did
not
choose
the
familiar
back
way
as
patience
did
had
he
occasion
to
call
but
knocked
at
the
front
is
jane
halliburton
within
you
can
go
and
see
said
crusty
disappointed
dobbs
flourishing
her
hand
towards
the
study
door
it
not
often
that
she
out
jane
rose
at
his
entrance
but
he
declined
to
sit
standing
while
he
delivered
the
message
with
which
he
had
been
charged
friend
thee
need
not
send
thy
son
to
the
manufactory
again
in
an
evening
except
on
saturdays
on
the
other
evenings
he
may
remain
at
home
from
and
pursue
his
studies
his
wages
will
not
be
lessened
and
jane
knew
that
the
considerate
kindness
emanated
from
thomas
ashley
she
managed
better
with
her
work
as
the
months
went
on
by
summer
she
could
do
it
quickly
the
days
were
long
then
and
by
dint
of
sitting
closely
to
it
she
could
earn
twelve
shillings
a
week
with
earnings
and
the
six
shillings
taken
from
reece
payments
that
made
it
was
quite
a
fortune
compared
with
what
had
been
but
like
most
good
fortunes
it
had
its
drawbacks
in
the
first
place
she
could
not
always
earn
it
she
was
compelled
to
steal
unwilling
time
to
mend
her
own
and
the
children
clothes
in
the
second
place
a
large
portion
of
it
had
to
be
devoted
to
buying
their
clothes
besides
other
incidental
expenses
so
that
in
the
matter
of
housekeeping
they
were
not
much
better
off
than
before
still
jane
did
begin
to
think
that
she
should
see
her
way
clearer
but
there
was
sorrow
of
a
different
nature
looming
in
the
distance
one
afternoon
which
jane
was
obliged
to
devote
to
plain
sewing
she
was
sitting
alone
in
the
study
when
there
came
a
hard
short
thump
at
it
which
was
dobbs
way
of
making
known
her
presence
there
come
in
dobbs
came
in
and
sat
herself
down
opposite
jane
it
was
summer
weather
and
the
august
dust
blew
in
at
the
open
window
i
want
to
know
the
matter
with
janey
began
she
without
circumlocution
with
janey
repeated
halliburton
what
should
be
the
matter
with
her
i
know
of
nothing
of
course
not
sarcastically
answered
dobbs
eyes
appear
to
be
given
to
some
folks
only
to
blind
more
the
pity
you
ca
see
it
my
missis
ca
see
it
but
i
say
that
the
child
is
oh
dobbs
i
think
you
must
be
mistaken
now
i
thank
you
to
be
civil
if
you
please
halliburton
retorted
dobbs
you
do
take
me
for
a
common
servant
i
hope
i
had
no
wish
to
be
uncivil
said
jane
i
am
so
accustomed
to
hearing
reece
call
you
dobbs
that
my
missis
is
one
case
and
other
folks
is
another
burst
forth
dobbs
by
way
of
interruption
i
have
a
handle
to
my
name
i
hope
which
is
dobbs
and
i
be
obleeged
to
you
not
to
forget
it
again
the
reason
that
janey
always
tired
now
i
ask
do
want
to
stir
gets
a
bright
pink
in
the
cheeks
and
inside
the
hands
it
is
only
the
effect
of
the
hot
weather
the
opinion
did
not
please
dobbs
there
not
a
earthly
thing
happens
but
it
laid
to
the
weather
she
angrily
cried
the
weather
indeed
if
janey
is
not
going
off
after
her
pa
it
an
odd
thing
to
me
jane
stood
still
does
she
have
or
does
she
not
demanded
dobbs
she
tells
me
she
hot
and
damp
so
i
conclude
it
is
so
only
from
the
heat
only
from
the
heat
panted
jane
eagerly
she
dared
not
admit
the
fear
well
the
first
time
i
go
down
to
the
town
i
shall
take
her
to
parry
it
wo
be
at
your
cost
she
hastened
to
add
in
ungracious
tones
for
jane
was
about
to
interrupt
if
she
wants
to
know
what
she
is
took
to
the
doctor
for
i
shall
tell
her
it
is
to
have
her
teeth
looked
at
she
has
a
nasty
cough
upon
her
perhaps
you
have
noticed
that
some
see
a
child
decaying
under
their
very
nose
while
strangers
can
see
it
palpable
she
has
coughed
since
last
week
the
day
of
the
rain
when
she
went
with
anna
lynn
into
the
field
at
the
back
and
they
got
their
feet
wet
oh
i
am
sure
there
is
nothing
seriously
the
matter
with
her
added
jane
resolutely
endeavouring
to
put
the
suggested
fear
from
her
i
want
her
in
she
must
help
me
with
my
sewing
then
she
not
to
help
resolutely
returned
dobbs
she
has
had
a
good
dinner
of
roast
lamb
and
kidney
potatoes
and
she
sitting
back
in
my
easy
chair
opposite
to
my
missis
in
hers
her
wanting
always
to
rest
might
have
told
some
folks
that
she
was
ailing
when
children
are
in
health
their
legs
and
wings
and
tongue
are
on
the
go
from
morning
till
night
you
never
need
pervide
with
a
seat
but
for
their
meals
and
give
their
way
they
eat
standing
jane
always
wanting
to
rest
now
and
she
shall
rest
but
indeed
she
must
help
me
urged
jane
she
can
sew
straight
seams
and
hem
look
at
this
heap
of
mending
and
it
must
be
finished
i
can
not
afford
to
be
about
it
what
sewing
is
it
you
want
done
questioned
dobbs
lifting
up
the
work
with
a
jerk
i
do
it
myself
sooner
than
the
child
shall
be
bothered
oh
no
thank
you
i
should
not
like
to
trouble
you
with
it
now
i
make
the
offer
to
do
the
work
crossly
responded
dobbs
and
if
i
did
mean
to
do
it
i
should
make
it
you
do
well
to
give
it
me
if
you
want
it
done
janey
sha
work
this
afternoon
taking
her
at
her
word
and
indeed
glad
to
do
so
jane
showed
dobbs
a
task
and
dobbs
swung
off
with
it
jane
called
after
her
that
she
had
not
taken
a
needle
and
cotton
dobbs
retorted
that
she
had
needles
and
cotton
of
her
own
she
hoped
and
need
be
beholden
to
anybody
else
for
jane
sat
on
anxious
all
the
afternoon
janey
remained
in
parlour
and
revelled
in
an
early
tea
and
pikelets
jane
was
disturbed
from
her
thoughts
by
the
boisterous
entrance
of
frank
and
gar
more
boisterous
than
usual
frank
was
a
most
excitable
boy
and
had
been
told
that
evening
by
the
head
master
of
the
college
school
the
reverend
keating
that
he
might
be
one
of
the
candidates
for
the
vacant
place
in
the
choir
this
was
enough
to
set
frank
off
for
a
week
you
know
what
a
nice
voice
you
say
i
have
mamma
what
a
good
ear
for
music
he
reiterated
as
good
you
tell
us
as
aunt
margaret
used
to
be
i
shall
be
sure
to
gain
the
post
if
you
will
let
me
try
we
have
to
be
at
college
for
an
hour
morning
and
afternoon
daily
but
we
can
easily
get
that
up
if
we
are
industrious
some
of
the
best
helstonleigh
scholars
who
have
shone
at
oxford
and
cambridge
were
choristers
and
i
should
have
about
ten
pounds
paid
to
me
ten
pounds
jane
listened
with
a
beating
heart
it
would
more
than
keep
him
in
clothes
she
inquired
more
fully
into
particulars
the
result
was
that
frank
had
permission
to
try
for
the
vacant
choristership
and
gained
it
his
voice
was
the
best
of
those
tried
he
went
home
in
a
glow
now
mamma
the
sooner
you
set
about
a
new
surplice
for
me
the
better
a
new
surplice
frank
ah
it
was
not
all
profit
a
chorister
must
have
two
surplices
mamma
king
scholars
can
do
with
one
having
them
washed
between
the
sundays
choristers
ca
we
must
have
them
always
in
wear
you
know
except
in
lent
and
on
the
day
of
king
charles
the
martyr
jane
smiled
he
talked
so
fast
what
is
that
you
are
running
on
about
goodness
mamma
do
you
understand
all
the
six
weeks
of
lent
and
on
the
of
january
the
cathedral
is
hung
with
black
and
the
choristers
have
to
wear
black
cloth
surplices
they
do
find
the
black
ones
the
college
does
that
frank
success
in
gaining
the
place
did
not
give
universal
pleasure
to
the
college
school
since
the
day
of
the
disturbance
in
the
spring
in
which
william
was
mixed
up
the
two
young
halliburtons
had
been
at
a
discount
with
the
desk
at
which
cyril
dare
sat
and
this
desk
pretty
well
ruled
the
school
it
coming
to
a
fine
pass
exclaimed
cyril
dare
when
the
result
of
the
trial
was
carried
into
the
school
here
the
town
clerk
own
son
passed
over
as
nobody
and
that
snob
of
a
halliburton
put
in
somebody
ought
to
have
told
the
dean
what
snobs
they
are
what
would
the
dean
have
cared
grumbled
another
whose
young
brother
had
been
amongst
the
rejected
ones
to
get
good
voices
in
the
choir
is
all
he
cares
for
in
the
matter
i
say
where
do
they
live
that
set
in
a
house
of
ashley
in
the
london
road
answered
cyril
dare
they
could
pay
the
rent
and
my
father
put
a
bum
in
bosh
dare
it
true
said
cyril
dare
my
father
manages
ashley
rents
you
know
they
have
had
every
stick
and
stone
sold
only
ashley
he
is
a
regular
soft
over
some
things
took
and
gave
them
time
oh
they
are
a
horrid
lot
they
do
keep
a
servant
the
blank
astonishment
this
last
item
of
intelligence
caused
at
the
desk
ca
be
described
again
cyril
word
was
disputed
they
do
i
tell
you
he
repeated
i
taxed
halliburton
senior
with
it
one
day
and
he
told
me
to
my
face
they
could
not
afford
one
he
possesses
brass
enough
to
set
up
a
foundry
does
that
fellow
the
eldest
one
is
at
ashley
manufactory
and
here
this
one
promoted
to
the
choir
over
gentlemen
heads
he
ought
to
be
pitched
into
ought
halliburton
senior
in
the
school
frank
was
halliburton
senior
gar
halliburton
junior
how
is
it
that
he
says
he
was
at
king
college
before
he
came
here
i
heard
him
tell
keating
so
asked
a
boy
at
this
moment
keating
voice
was
heard
silence
cyril
dare
let
a
minute
elapse
and
then
began
again
such
a
low
thing
you
know
not
to
keep
servants
we
could
do
at
all
without
five
or
six
i
tell
you
what
the
school
may
do
as
it
likes
but
our
desk
shall
cut
the
two
fellows
here
and
the
desk
did
so
and
frank
and
gar
had
to
put
up
with
many
mortifications
there
was
no
help
for
it
frank
was
brave
as
a
young
lion
but
against
some
sorts
of
oppression
there
is
no
standing
up
more
than
once
was
the
boy
in
tears
telling
his
griefs
to
his
mother
it
fell
more
on
frank
than
it
did
on
gar
jane
could
only
strive
to
console
him
as
she
did
william
patience
and
forbearance
my
darling
frank
you
will
outlive
it

chapter

shadows
in
honey
fair
august
was
hot
in
honey
fair
the
women
sat
at
their
open
doors
or
even
outside
them
the
children
tumbled
in
the
gutters
the
refuse
in
the
road
was
none
the
better
for
the
month
heat
charlotte
east
sat
in
her
kitchen
one
tuesday
afternoon
busy
as
usual
her
door
was
shut
but
her
window
was
open
suddenly
the
latch
was
lifted
and
cross
came
in
not
with
the
bold
boisterous
movements
that
were
common
to
honey
fair
but
with
creeping
steps
that
seemed
afraid
of
their
own
echoes
and
a
scared
face
cross
was
in
trouble
her
two
daughters
amelia
and
mary
ann
to
whom
you
have
had
the
honour
of
an
introduction
had
purchased
those
lovely
sarcenets
green
pink
and
lilac
and
worn
them
at
the
party
at
the
alhambra
which
party
went
off
satisfactorily
leaving
nothing
behind
it
but
some
headaches
for
the
next
day
and
a
trifle
of
pecuniary
embarrassment
to
honey
fair
in
general
what
with
the
finery
for
the
party
and
other
finery
and
what
with
articles
really
useful
but
which
perhaps
have
been
done
without
honey
fair
was
pretty
deeply
in
with
the
bankes
in
cross
family
alone
herself
and
her
daughters
owed
conjointly
so
much
to
these
accommodating
tradesmen
that
it
took
eight
shillings
a
week
to
keep
them
quiet
you
can
readily
understand
how
this
impoverished
the
weekly
housekeeping
and
the
falsehoods
that
had
to
be
concocted
by
way
of
keeping
the
husband
jacob
cross
in
the
dark
were
something
alarming
this
was
the
state
of
things
in
many
of
the
homes
of
honey
fair
cross
came
in
with
timid
steps
and
a
scared
face
charlotte

me

shillings

love
of

charlotte
when

and
rave
the
house
out
of
winders
he
would
be
angry
at
first
no
doubt
but
when
he
cooled
down
he
would
see
the
necessity
of
something
being
done
and
help
in
it
if
you
all
set
on
and
put
your
shoulders
to
the
wheel
you
might
soon
get
clear
live
upon
the
very
least
that
will
satisfy
hunger
the
plainest
food
dry
bread
and
potatoes
no
beer
no
meat
no
finery
no
luxuries
and
with
the
rest
of
the
week
money
begin
to
pay
up
you
be
clear
in
no
time
cross
stared
in
consternation
you
be
a
job
comforter
charlotte
dry
bread
and
taters
who
could
put
up
with
that
when
poor
people
like
us
fall
into
trouble
it
is
the
only
way
that
i
know
of
to
get
out
of
it
i
rather
mortify
my
appetite
for
a
year
than
have
my
rest
broken
by
care
your
advice
is
good
enough
for
talking
charlotte
but
it
do
answer
for
acting
cross
must
have
his
bit
o
meat
and
his
beer
his
butter
and
his
cheese
his
tea
and
his
sugar

it
me
charlotte

is
for
the
landlord
we
almost
in
a
fix
with
him
for
the
landlord

charlotte
involuntarily

or
it
would
be
the
worst
of
all
i
know
we
must
he
was
took
bad
yesterday
more
the
blessing
and
could
get
round
but
he
here
as
burly
as
beef
we
paid
him
for
this
three
weeks
she
added
dropping
her
voice
to
an
ominous
whisper
and
i
declare
to
you
charlotte
east
that
the
sight
of
him
at
our
door
is
as
good
to
me
as
a
dose
of
physic
just
now
round
he
comes
the
latch
and
me
turning
sick
the
minute
i
sees
him
mrs
cross
asks
he
in
his
short
surly
way
putting
his
brown
wig
up

it
this
if

me
some
money

shall
apply
to

fright

me
into
i

but
what
the
rent
paid
up
regular
know
what
going
on
old
abbott
begins
again
i
have
knowed
it
for
some
time
you
women
in
this
honey
fair
you
pay
your
money
to
them
bankeses
which
is
the
blight
o
the
place
and
then
you
ca
pay
me
only
fancy
his
calling
bankeses
a
blight
that
just
what
they
are
remarked
charlotte
for
shame
charlotte
east
when
one
way
is
a
bit
eased
by
being
able
to
get
a
few
things
on
trust
you
must
put
in
your
word
again
it
some
of
us
would
never
get
a
new
gown
to
our
backs
if
it
was
for
bankeses
abbott
gone
off
to
other
houses
collecting
warning
me
as
he
call
again
in
half
an
hour
and
if
some
money
was
ready
for
him
then
go
straight
off
to
jacob
to
his
shop
o
work
if
you
can
let
me
have
one
week
for
him
charlotte
five
shillings
i
be
ever
grateful
charlotte
rose
unlocked
a
drawer
and
gave
five
shillings
to
cross
thinking
in
her
own
mind
that
the
kindest
course
would
be
for
the
landlord
to
go
to
cross
as
he
had
threatened
cross
took
the
money
her
mind
so
far
relieved
she
could
indulge
in
a
little
gossip
for
abbott
had
not
yet
expired
i
say
charlotte
what
d
think
i
afraid
ben
tyrrett
and
our
mary
ann
is
to
take
up
together
indeed
exclaimed
charlotte
that
new
not
they
have
been
talking
together
on
and
off
but
i
never
thought
it
was
serious
till
last
sunday
i
have
set
my
face
dead
against
it
he
has
a
nasty
temper
of
his
own
and
he
nothing
but
a
jobber
at
fifteen
shillings
a
week
and
his
profits
of
the
our
mary
ann
might
do
better
than
that
i
think
she
might
assented
charlotte
and
she
is
to
think
of
marrying
young
wrathfully
repeated
cross
i
should
think
she
is
young
girls
are
as
soft
as
apes
the
minute
a
chap
says
a
word
to
about
marrying
they
all
agog
to
do
it
whether
it
fit
or
whether
unfit
our
mary
ann
might
look
inches
over
ben
tyrrett
head
if
she
had
any
sense
in
her
hark
ye
charlotte
when
you
see
her
just
put
in
a
word
against
it
maybe
it
turn
her
tell
her
you
not
have
tyrrett
at
a
gift
and
that
true
replied
charlotte
with
a
laugh
as
her
guest
departed
a
few
minutes
and
charlotte
received
another
visitor
this
was
the
wife
of
mark
mason
a
tall
bony
woman
with
rough
black
hair
and
a
loud
voice
that
voice
and
mark
did
not
get
on
very
well
together
she
put
her
hands
back
upon
her
hips
and
used
it
now
standing
before
charlotte
in
a
threatening
attitude
what
do
you
do
keeping
our
carry
out
at
night
charlotte
looked
up
in
surprise
she
was
thinking
of
something
else
or
her
answer
might
have
been
more
cautious
for
she
was
one
of
those
who
never
willingly
make
mischief
i
do
not
keep
caroline
out
she
is
here
of
an
evening
now
and
then
not
often
mason
laughed
a
low
derisive
laugh
of
mockery
i
knew
it
was
a
falsehood
when
she
told
it
me
there
she
goes
out
night
after
night
night
after
night
so
i
set
mark
on
to
her
for
i
could
keep
her
in
neither
find
out
where
she
went
to
mark
was
in
a
passion
something
had
put
him
out
and
carry
was
frightened
for
he
had
hold
of
her
arm
am
at
charlotte
east
of
a
night
mark
she
said
shall
take
no
harm
there
charlotte
did
not
lift
her
eyes
from
her
work
mason
stood
defiantly
now
then
where
is
it
she
gets
to
why
do
you
apply
to
me
returned
charlotte
i
am
not
caroline
keeper
if
you
bai
her
keeper
you
be
her
adviser
retorted
mason
and
that
worse
when
i
advise
caroline
at
all
i
advise
her
for
her
good
my
eyes
are
opened
now
if
they
was
blind
before
continued
mason
apostrophizing
in
no
gentle
terms
the
offending
caroline
who
gave
carry
that
there
shawl
who
gave
her
that
there
fine
gown
who
gave
her
that
gold
brooch
with
a
stone
in
it
red
and
yaller
and
a
naked
cupid
in
white
aflying
on
it
nice
brooch
you
got
there
miss
says
i
to
her
says
she
call
cameons
where
did
you
get
it
pray
says
i
that
my
business
answers
she
next
there
was
a
green
and
lavender
with
yaller
fringe
at
its
ends
as
deep
as
my
forefinger
running
up
a
tidy
score
at
bankes
my
lady
says
i
sha
come
to
you
to
pay
for
it
says
she
thinks
i
to
myself
you
be
living
in
our
house
and
you
may
bring
mark
into
trouble
over
it
for
he
a
gander
at
times
so
down
i
goes
to
bankes
place
last
night
turn
to
the
young
man
says
i
to
the
gentleman
behind
the
counter
it
were
the
one
with
the
dark
hair
tell
me
how
much
is
owed
by
caroline
mason
to
settle
it
asks
he
and
maybe
not
says
i
wants
my
question
answered
whether
or
no
are
you
listening
charlotte
east
charlotte
lifted
her
eyes
from
her
work
yes
he
lays
hold
of
a
big
book
continues
mason
who
was
talking
her
face
crimson
and
draws
his
finger
down
its
pages
mason
caroline
mason
says
he
do
think
we
have
anything
against
her
no
it
crossed
off
there
was
a
trifle
against
her
but
she
paid
it
last
week
well
i
stood
staring
at
the
man
thinking
he
was
deceiving
me
saying
she
had
did
she
pay
for
that
shawl
she
had
in
the
winter
and
how
much
did
it
cost
asks
i
says
he
mason
has
had
no
shawl
of
us
a
gown
at
easter
a
fancy
sort
of
thing
with
stripes
i
goes
on
a
cameon
brooch
last
week
nor
a
scarf
with
yaller
fringe
o
the
sort
says
he
decisive
mason
has
bought
any
of
those
things
from
us
she
had
some
bonnet
ribbon
and
that
she
paid
for
now
what
was
i
to
think
concluded
mason
charlotte
did
not
know
i
comes
home
and
at
the
corner
of
the
lane
i
catches
sight
of
a
certain
gentleman
loitering
about
in
the
shade
the
truth
flashed
into
my
mind
after
our
caroline
says
i
to
myself
it
him
that
has
given
her
the
things
and
we
shall
just
have
her
a
spectacle
i
accused
eliza
tyrrett
of
being
the
confidant
me
says
she
charlotte
east
so
i
bottled
up
my
temper
till
now
and
now
i
come
to
learn
the
rights
o
i
can
not
tell
you
the
rights
replied
charlotte
i
do
not
know
them
i
have
striven
to
give
caroline
some
good
advice
lately
and
that
is
all
i
have
had
to
do
with
it
mason
you
know
that
i
should
never
advise
caroline
or
any
one
else
but
for
her
good
mason
would
have
acknowledged
this
in
a
cooler
moment
why
did
that
tyrrett
girl
laugh
at
me
then
and
why
did
carry
say
she
spent
her
evenings
here
cried
she
the
gentleman
i
see
was
young
anthony
dare
and
carry
had
better
bury
herself
alive
than
be
drawn
aside
by
his
nonsense
much
better
acquiesced
charlotte
where
is
caroline
under
lock
and
key
said
mason
under
lock
and
key
echoed
charlotte
yes
under
lock
and
key
and
there
she
shall
stop
she
was
out
all
this
blessed
morning
with
eliza
tyrrett
and
never
walked
herself
in
till
after
mark
had
had
his
dinner
and
was
gone
so
then
i
began
upon
her
my
temper
was
up
and
i
did
spare
her
i
vowed
i
tell
mark
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
and
what
sort
of
a
wolf
she
allowed
to
make
her
presents
of
fine
clothes
with
that
she
turned
wild
and
flung
up
to
her
room
in
the
and
i
followed
and
locked
her
in
you
have
done
very
wrong
said
charlotte
it
is
not
by
harshness
that
any
good
will
be
done
with
caroline
you
know
her
disposition
a
child
might
lead
her
by
kindness
but
she
rises
up
against
harshness
my
opinion
is
that
she
never
would
have
given
the
least
trouble
at
all
had
you
made
her
a
better
home
this
bold
avowal
took
away
mason
breath
a
better
home
cried
she
when
she
could
speak
a
better
home
fed
upon
french
rolls
and
lobster
salad
and
apricot
tarts
and
give
her
a
lady
maid
to
her
gown
for
her
my
heart
that
beats
all
i
do
speak
of
food
and
that
sort
of
thing
rejoined
charlotte
if
you
had
treated
her
with
kind
words
instead
of
cross
ones
she
would
have
been
as
good
a
girl
as
ever
lived
instead
of
that
you
have
made
your
home
unbearable
and
so
driven
her
out
with
her
dangerous
good
looks
to
be
told
of
them
by
the
first
idler
who
came
across
her
and
that
seems
to
have
been
anthony
dare
go
home
and
let
her
out
of
where
you
have
locked
her
in
do
hetty
mason
let
her
out
and
speak
kindly
to
her
and
treat
her
as
a
sister
and
you
undo
all
the
bad
yet
i
sha
then
was
the
passionate
reply
i
see
you
and
her
hung
first
before
i
speak
kind
to
her
to
encourage
her
in
her
loose
ways
mason
flung
out
of
the
house
as
she
concluded
giving
the
door
a
bang
which
only
had
the
effect
of
sending
it
open
again
charlotte
sighed
as
she
rose
to
close
it
not
only
for
any
peril
that
caroline
mason
might
be
in
but
for
the
general
blindness
the
distorted
views
of
right
and
wrong
which
seemed
to
obtain
amidst
the
women
of
honey
fair
chapter
iii
the
dares
at
home
a
profusion
of
glass
and
plate
glittered
on
the
of
dare
it
was
six
and
they
had
just
sat
down
dare
in
a
light
gauze
dress
and
blonde
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
there
was
a
large
family
of
them
four
sons
and
four
daughters
and
all

helping
the
salmon
in
due

a
plate
followed
by
the
sauce

carried
to
anthony
what
this
melted

where
the
lobster
sauce
there

the
anchovy
to
mr
anthony
anthony
jerked
the
anchovy
sauce
off
the
salver
dashed
some
on
to
his
plate
and
jerked
the
bottle
back
again
not
with
a
very
good
grace
his
palate
was
a
dainty
one
indeed
it
was
a
family
complaint
i
would
give
a
fig
for
salmon
without
lobster
sauce
he
cried
i
hope
you
wo
send

it
was
the
cook

she

not
fully

my
orders

anthony

at
her
brother
ann

cucumber
to
mr
anthony

i
never

cucumber
with
salmon
grumbled
anthony
in
reply
and
it
was
not
graciously
spoken
for
the
offer
had
been
dictated
by
a
pause
ensued
it
was
at
length
broken
by
dare
herbert
are
you
growing
more
reconciled
to
no
and
never
shall
returned
herbert
from
ten
till
five
is
an
awful
clog
upon
one
time
it
as
bad
as
school
dare
looked
up
from
his
plate
you
might
have
been
put
to
a
profession
that
would
occupy
a
great
deal
more
time
than
that
herbert
what
calls
have
you
upon
your
time
pray
that
it
is
so
valuable
will
you
take
some
more
fish
well
i
do
know
i
think
i
will
it
is
good
very
good
with
the
cucumber
that
anthony
despises
ann
took
his
plate
up
to
dare
anthony
said
that
gentleman
as
he
helped
the
salmon
where
were
you
this
afternoon
you
were
away
from
the
office
altogether
after
two
out
with
hawkesley
shortly
replied
anthony
yes
it
is
all
very
well
to
say
with
hawkesley
but
the
office
suffers
i
wish
you
young
men
were
not
quite
so
fond
of
taking
your
pleasure
a
little
more
fish
sir
asked
joseph
of
anthony
not
if
i
know
it
the
second
course
came
in
a
quarter
of
lamb
asparagus
and
other
vegetables
herbert
looked
cross
he
had
recently
taken
a
dislike
to
lamb
or
fancied
he
had
done
so
of
course
there
something
coming
for
me
he
said
oh
of
course
said
dare
cook
knows
you
do
like
lamb
nothing
however
came
in
ann
was
sent
to
inquire
the
reason
of
the
neglect
the
cook
had
been
unable
to
procure
veal
cutlet
and
master
herbert
had
said
if
she
ever
sent
him
up
a
again
he
should
throw
it
at
her
head
such
was
the
message
brought
back
what
an
old
she
must
be
to
say
she
could
not
get
veal
cutlet
exclaimed
herbert
i
hate
mutton
and
lamb
and
i
am
not
going
to
eat
either
one
or
the
other
i
heard
the
butcher
say
this
morning
that
he
had
no
veal
master
herbert
interposed
ann
this
hot
weather
they
do
kill
much
meat
why
have
you
taken
this
dislike
to
lamb
herbert
asked
dare
you
have
eaten
it
all
the
season
that
just
it
answered
herbert
i
have
eaten
so
much
of
it
that
i
am
sick
of
it
never
mind
herbert
said
his
mother
there
a
cherry
tart
coming
and
a
delicious
lemon
pudding
i
do
think
you
can
be
so
very
hungry
you
went
twice
to
salmon
herbert
was
not
in
a
good
humour
all
the
dares
had
been
culpably
pampered
and
of
course
it
bore
its
fruits
he
sat
drumming
with
his
silver
fork
upon
the
table
condescending
to
try
a
little
asparagus
and
a
great
deal
of
both
pie
and
pudding
cheese
salad
and
dessert
followed
of
which
herbert
partook
plentifully
still
he
thought
he
was
terribly
used
in
not
having
had
different
meat
specially
provided
for
him
and
he
could
not
recover
his
good
humour
i
tell
you
the
dares
had
been
most
culpably
indulged
the
house
was
one
of
luxury
and
profusion
and
every
little
whim
and
fancy
had
been
studied
it
is
one
of
the
worst
schools
a
child
can
be
reared
in
the
three
younger
daughters
and
the
governess
withdrew
after
taking
each
a
glass
of
wine
cyril
and
george
went
off
likewise
to
their
lessons
or
to
play
it
was
their
own
affair
and
dare
made
it
no
concern
of
his
presently
dare
and
adelaide
rose
hawkesley
coming
in
this
evening
called
out
anthony
as
they
were
going
through
the
door
adelaide
turned
what
did
you
say
anthony
lord
hawkesley
coming
at
least
he
said
he
would
look
in
for
an
hour
but
there
no
dependence
to
be
placed
on
him
we
must
be
in
the
large
mamma
this
evening
said
adelaide
as
they
crossed
the
hall
miss
benyon
and
the
children
can
take
tea
in
the
yes
assented
dare
it
is
bad
form
to
have
one
cucumbered
with
children
and
lord
hawkesley
understands
all
that
let
them
be
in
the
julia
also
dare
shrugged
her
shoulders
if
you
can
persuade
her
into
it
i
do
think
julia
will
consent
to
take
tea
in
the
why
should
she
adelaide
vouchsafed
no
reply
dutiful
children
they
were
not
affectionate
children
they
were
not
they
had
not
been
brought
up
to
be
so
dare
was
of
the
world
worldly
very
much
so
and
that
leaves
very
little
time
upon
the
hands
for
earnest
duties
she
had
taken
no
pains
to
train
her
children
she
had
given
them
very
little
love
this
conversation
had
taken
place
in
the
hall
dare
went
upstairs
to
the
large
a
really
handsome
room
she
rang
the
bell
and
gave
sundry
orders
the
moving
motive
for
all
being
the
doubtful
visit
of
viscount
hawkesley
ices
from
the
pastrycook
a
tray
of
refreshments
the
best
china
the
best
silver
then
dare
reclined
in
her
chair
for
her
nap
an
indulgence
she
much
favoured
adelaide
dare
entered
the
smaller
an
apartment
more
commonly
used
and
opening
from
the
hall
julia
was
reading
a
book
just
brought
in
from
the
library
miss
benyon
was
softly
playing
and
the
two
little
ones
were
quarrelling
miss
benyon
turned
round
from
the
piano
when
adelaide
entered
you
must
make
tea
in
the
this
evening
miss
benyon
for
the
children
julia
you
are
to
take
yours
there
julia
looked
up
from
her
book
who
says
so
mamma
lord
hawkesley
coming
and
we
can
not
have
the
crowded
i
am
not
going
to
keep
out
of
the
for
lord
hawkesley
returned
julia
a
quiet
girl
in
appearance
and
manner
who
is
lord
hawkesley
that
he
should
disarrange
the
economy
of
the
house
so
much
ceremony
and
parade
observed
when
he
comes
that
it
upsets
all
comfort
your
lordship
this
and
your
lordship
that
and
papa
him
to
the
skies
i
do
like
it
he
looks
down
upon
us
i
know
he
does
although
he
condescends
to
make
a
sort
of
friend
of
anthony
adelaide
dare
dark
eyes
flashed
and
her
face
crimsoned
she
was
a
handsome
girl
julia
i
do
think
you
are
an
idiot
perhaps
i
am
composedly
returned
julia
who
was
of
a
careless
easy
temper
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
kept
out
of
the
for
my
lord
hawkesley
let
me
go
on
with
my
book
in
peace
adelaide
it
is
a
charming
one
meanwhile
herbert
dare
seeing
no
prospect
of
more
wine
in
store
for
dare
with
wonderful
prudence
told
herbert
that
two
glasses
of
port
were
sufficient
for
him
left
his
seat
and
bolted
out
at
the
window
which
opened
on
to
the
ground
he
ran
into
the
hall
for
his
hat
and
then
speeding
across
the
lawn
passed
into
the
anthony
remained
alone
with
his
father
and
anthony
was
plucking
up
courage
to
speak
upon
a
subject
that
was
causing
him
some
perplexity
he
plunged
into
it
at
once
father
i
am
in
a
mess
i
have
managed
to
outrun
the
constable
dare
was
at
that
moment
holding
his
glass
of
wine
between
his
eye
and
the
light
the
words
quite
scared
him
he
set
his
glass
down
and
looked
at
anthony
how
that
how
have
you
managed
that
i
do
know
how
it
has
come
about
was
anthony
answer
it
is
so
sir
and
you
must
be
so
good
as
to
help
me
out
of
it
your
allowance
is
sufficient
amply
so
do
you
forget
that
i
set
you
clear
of
debt
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
what
money
do
you
want
anthony
dare
began
pulling
the
fringe
out
of
the
dessert
napkin
to
the
great
detriment
of
the
damask
two
hundred
pounds
sir
two
hundred
pounds
echoed
dare
a
dark
expression
clouding
his
handsome
face
do
you
want
to
ruin
me
anthony
look
at
my
expenses
look
at
the
claims
upon
me
i
say
that
your
allowance
is
a
liberal
one
and
you
ought
to
keep
within
it
anthony
sat
biting
his
lip
i
would
not
have
applied
to
you
sir
if
i
could
have
helped
it
but
i
am
driven
into
a
corner
and
find
money
i
and
hawkesley
drew
some
bills
together
he
has
taken
up
two
and
i
then
you
and
hawkesley
were
a
couple
of
fools
for
your
pains
intemperately
interrupted
dare
there
no
game
so
dangerous
so
delusive
as
that
of
drawing
bills
have
i
not
told
you
so
over
and
over
again
simple
debt
may
be
put
off
from
month
to
month
and
from
year
to
year
but
bills
are
nasty
things
when
i
was
a
young
man
i
lived
for
years
upon
promises
to
pay
but
i
took
care
not
to
put
my
name
to
a
bill
hawkesley
hawkesley
may
do
what
you
must
not
interrupted
dare
drowning
his
son
voice
he
has
his
father
long
to
turn
to
recollect
anthony
this
must
not
occur
again
it
is
impossible
that
i
can
be
called
upon
periodically
for
these
sums
herbert
is
almost
a
man
and
cyril
and
george
are
growing
up
a
pretty
thing
if
you
were
all
to
come
upon
me
in
this
manner
i
have
to
exert
my
wits
as
it
is
i
can
tell
you
i
give
you
a
cheque
and
i
should
serve
you
right
if
i
were
to
put
you
upon
half
allowance
until
i
am
repaid
dare
finished
his
wine
rang
for
the
table
to
be
cleared
and
left
the
room
anthony
remained
standing
against
the
side
of
the
window
half
in
half
out
buried
in
a
brown
study
when
herbert
came
up
leaping
over
the
grass
herbert
was
nearly
as
tall
as
anthony
he
had
been
for
some
time
articled
to
his
father
but
had
only
joined
the
office
the
previous
midsummer
he
looked
into
the
room
and
saw
it
was
empty
where
the
governor
gone
somewhere
into
the
perhaps
replied
anthony
what
a
nuisance
ejaculated
herbert
one
ca
talk
to
him
before
the
girls
i
want
shillings
from
him
markham
has
the
primest
to
sell
and
i
must
have
it
shillings
for
a
cried
anthony
and
cheap
at
the
price
answered
herbert
you
do
often
see
so
complete
a
thing
as
this
markham
would
not
part
with
it
it
a
relic
of
his
better
days
he
says
only
his
old
mother
wants
some
comfort
or
other
which
he
ca
otherwise
afford
the
case
you
have
already
half
a
dozen
rubbish
that
what
they
are
compared
with
this
one
it
no
business
of
yours
anthony
not
at
all
but
you
oblige
me
herbert
by
not
bothering
the
governor
for
money
i
have
been
asking
him
for
some
and
it
has
put
him
out
did
you
get
it
anthony
nodded
then
you
let
me
have
the
anthony
i
ca
returned
anthony
i
shall
have
a
cheque
and
i
must
pay
it
away
whole
wo
clear
me
but
i
did
dare
to
tell
of
more
if
i
do
get
that
markham
may
sell
it
to
some
one
else
grumbled
herbert
go
and
get
it
replied
anthony
promise
him
the
money
for
you
are
not
obliged
to
give
it
you
know
the
governor
has
just
said
that
he
lived
for
years
upon
promises
to
pay
markham
wants
the
money
down
he
think
that
as
good
as
down
if
you
tell
him
he
shall
have
it
bring
the
away
possession
nine
points
of
the
law
you
know
he
make
such
an
awful
row
afterwards
if
he
finds
he
does
not
get
the
money
let
him
you
can
row
again
it
the
easiest
thing
on
earth
to
fence
off
little
paltry
debts
like
that
people
get
tired
of
asking
for
them
away
vaulted
herbert
for
the
anthony
yawned
stretched
himself
and
walked
out
just
as
twilight
was
fading
he
was
going
out
to
keep
an
appointment
herbert
dare
went
back
to
markham
the
man
though
indeed
so
far
as
birth
went
he
might
be
called
a
gentleman
lived
a
little
way
beyond
dare
the
cottage
was
situated
in
the
midst
of
a
large
garden
in
which
markham
worked
late
and
early
he
had
a
very
very
small
patrimony
upon
which
he
lived
and
kept
his
mother
he
was
bending
over
one
of
the
beds
when
herbert
returned
he
would
take
the
then
and
bring
the
money
over
at
nine
in
the
morning
before
going
to
the
office
dare
was
gone
out
or
he
would
have
brought
it
at
once
was
the
substance
of
the
words
in
which
herbert
concluded
the
negotiation
could
they
have
looked
behind
the
hedge
at
that
moment
herbert
dare
and
markham
they
would
have
seen
two
young
gentlemen
suddenly
duck
down
under
its
shelter
creep
silently
along
heedless
of
the
ditch
which
however
was
tolerably
dry
at
that
season
make
a
sudden
bolt
across
the
road
when
they
got
opposite
dare
entrance
and
whisk
within
its
gates
they
were
cyril
and
george
that
they
had
been
at
some
mischief
and
were
trying
to
escape
detection
was
unmistakable
under
cover
of
the
as
they
had
previously
done
under
cover
of
the
hedge
crept
they
sprang
into
the
house
by
the
window
tore
up
the
stairs
and
took
refuge
in
the
startlingly
arousing
dare
from
her
slumbers
in
point
of
fact
they
had
reckoned
upon
finding
the
room
unoccupied
chapter
iv
throwing
at
the
bats
aroused
thus
abruptly
out
of
sleep
cross
and
startled
dare
attacked
the
two
boys
with
angry
words
i
will
know
what
you
have
been
doing
she
exclaimed
rising
and
shaking
out
the
flounces
of
her
dress
you
have
been
at
some
mischief
why
do
you
come
violently
in
in
this
manner
looking
as
frightened
as
hares
not
frightened
replied
cyril
we
are
only
hot
we
had
a
run
for
it
a
run
for
what
she
repeated
when
i
say
i
will
know
a
thing
i
mean
to
know
it
i
ask
you
what
you
have
been
doing
it
nothing
very
dreadful
that
you
need
put
yourself
out
replied
george
one
of
old
markham
windows
has
come
to
grief
then
that
through
throwing
stones
again
exclaimed
dare
now
i
am
certain
of
it
and
you
need
not
attempt
to
deny
it
you
shall
pay
for
it
out
of
your
own
if
he
comes
here
as
he
did
the
last
time
ah
but
he
wo
come
here
returned
cyril
he
did
see
us
is
tea
not
ready
you
can
go
to
the
and
see
you
are
to
take
it
there
this
evening
the
boys
tore
away
to
the
unlike
julia
they
did
not
care
where
they
took
it
provided
they
had
it
miss
benyon
was
pouring
out
the
tea
as
they
entered
they
threw
themselves
on
a
sofa
and
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
so
immoderate
and
long
that
their
two
young
sisters
crowded
round
eagerly
asking
to
hear
the
joke
it
was
the
primest
fun
cried
cyril
when
he
could
speak
we
have
just
smashed
one
of
markham
windows
the
old
woman
was
at
it
in
a
nightcap
and
i
think
the
stone
must
have
touched
her
head
markham
and
herbert
were
holding
a
confab
together
and
they
never
saw
us
we
were
chucking
at
the
leathering
bats
put
in
george
jealous
that
his
brother
should
have
all
the
telling
to
himself
and
the
stone
it
is
bat
george
interrupted
the
governess
i
corrected
you
the
other
night
what
does
it
matter
roughly
answered
george
i
wish
you
would
put
me
out
a
dipped
down
nearly
right
upon
our
heads
and
we
both
heaved
at
him
and
one
of
the
stones
went
through
the
window
nearly
taking
as
cyril
says
old
mother
markham
head
wo
they
be
in
a
temper
at
having
to
pay
for
it
they
are
as
poor
as
charity
they
make
you
pay
said
rosa
will
they
retorted
cyril
no
catch
no
have
i
give
them
leave
to
make
us
pay
when
they
find
us
out
do
you
suppose
we
are
donkeys
you
girls
we
dipped
down
under
the
hedge
and
not
a
soul
saw
us
what
for
tea
bread
and
butter
replied
the
governess
then
those
may
eat
it
that
like
i
shall
have
jam
cyril
rang
the
bell
as
he
spoke
nancy
the
maid
who
waited
on
the
came
in
answer
to
it
some
jam
said
cyril
and
be
quick
over
it
what
sort
sir
inquired
nancy
sort
oh
let
see
damson
the
damson
jam
was
finished
last
week
sir
it
is
nearly
the
season
to
make
more
cyril
replied
by
a
rude
and
ugly
word
after
some
cogitation
he
decided
upon
black
currant
and
bring
me
up
some
apricot
put
in
george
and
we
have
some
gooseberry
called
out
rosa
if
you
boys
have
jam
we
have
some
too
nancy
disappeared
cyril
suddenly
threw
himself
back
on
the
sofa
and
burst
into
another
ringing
laugh
i
ca
help
it
he
exclaimed
i
am
thinking
of
the
old
woman
fright
and
their
dismay
at
having
to
pay
the
damage
do
you
know
what
i
should
do
in
your
place
cyril
said
miss
benyon
i
should
go
back
to
markham
and
tell
him
honourably
that
i
caused
the
accident
you
know
how
poor
they
are
they
can
not
afford
to
pay
for
it
cyril
stared
at
miss
benyon
where
be
the
pull
of
that
asked
he
the
cyril
would
be
that
you
would
repair
a
wrong
done
to
an
unoffending
neighbour
and
might
go
to
sleep
with
a
clear
conscience
the
last
suggestion
amused
cyril
amazingly
he
and
conscience
had
not
a
great
deal
to
do
with
each
other
he
was
politely
telling
miss
benyon
that
those
notions
were
good
enough
for
old
maids
when
nancy
appeared
with
the
several
sorts
of
jam
demanded
cyril
drew
his
chair
to
the
table
and
nancy
went
down
ring
the
bell
rosa
said
cyril
before
the
girl
could
well
have
reached
the
kitchen
i
ca
see
one
sort
from
another
we
must
have
candles
ring
it
yourself
retorted
rosa
george
ring
the
bell
commanded
cyril
george
obeyed
he
was
under
cyril
in
the
college
school
and
accustomed
to
obey
him
you
might
have
told
nancy
when
she
was
here
remarked
miss
benyon
to
cyril
it
would
have
saved
her
a
journey
and
if
it
would
asked
cyril
what
were
servants
legs
made
for
but
to
be
used
nancy
received
the
order
for
the
candles
and
brought
them
up
it
was
to
be
hoped
her
legs
made
to
be
used
for
scarcely
had
cyril
begun
to
enjoy
his
black
currant
jam
when
they
were
heard
coming
up
the
stairs
again
master
cyril
markham
wants
to
see
you
cyril
and
the
rest
exchanged
looks

at
home

were
an
idiot
for
your
pains
i
ca

down

tea

accordingly
and
back
she
came
again
he
says

must
see
you
master
cyril
be
a
man
cyril
and
face
it
whispered
miss
benyon
in
his
ear
cyril
jerked
his
head
rudely
away
from
her
i
wo
go
down
there
nancy
you
may
tell
markham
so
he
has
sat
down
on
the
garden
bench
sir
outside
the
window
to
wait
explained
nancy
he
says
if
you
wo
see
him
he
shall
ask
for
mr
dare
cyril
appeared
to
be
in
for
it
he
dashed
his
bread
and
jam
on
the
table
and
clattered
down
who
wanting
me
called
out
he
when
he
got
outside
oh
is
it
you
markham
how
came
you
to
throw
a
stone
just
now
and
break
my
window
cyril
dare
the
words
threw
cyril
into
the
greatest
apparent
surprise
throw
a
stone
and
break
your
window
repeated
he
i
do
know
what
you
mean
either
you
or
your
brother
threw
it
you
were
both
together
it
entered
my
mother
bedroom
window
and
went
within
an
inch
of
her
head
trouble
you
to
send
a
glazier
round
to
put
the
pane
in
well
of
all
strange
accusations
this
is
about
the
strangest
uttered
cyril
we
have
not
been
near
your
window
we
are
upstairs
at
our
tea
at
this
juncture
dare
came
out
he
had
heard
the
altercation
in
the
house
what
this
asked
he
good
evening
markham
markham
explained
they
crouched
down
under
the
hedge
when
they
had
done
the
mischief
he
continued
thinking
no
doubt
to
get
away
undetected
but
as
it
happened
brooks
the
nurseryman
was
in
his
ground
behind
the
opposite
hedge
and
he
saw
the
whole
he
says
they
were
throwing
at
the
bats
now
i
should
be
sorry
to
get
them
punished
dare
we
have
been
boys
ourselves
but
if
young
gentlemen
will
throw
stones
they
must
pay
for
any
damage
they
do
i
have
requested
your
son
to
send
a
glazier
round
in
the
morning
i
am
sorry
he
should
have
denied
the
fact
dare
turned
to
cyril
if
you
did
it
why
do
you
deny
it
cyril
hesitated
for
the
tenth
part
of
a
second
which
would
be
the
best
policy
to
give
in
or
to
hold
out
he
chose
the
latter
his
word
was
as
good
as
that
confounded
brooks
and
he
brave
it
out
we
did
do
it
he
angrily
said
we
have
not
been
near
the
place
this
evening
brooks
must
have
mistaken
others
for
us
in
the
dusk
they
did
do
it
dare
there
no
mistake
about
it
brooks
had
been
watching
them
and
he
thinks
it
was
the
bigger
one
who
threw
that
particular
stone
if
i
had
set
a
house
on
fire
markham
added
to
cyril
i
rather
confess
the
accident
than
deny
it
by
a
lie
what
sort
of
a
man
do
you
expect
to
make
a
better
one
than
you
insolently
retorted
cyril
wait
an
instant
said
dare
he
proceeded
to
the
to
inquire
of
george
that
young
gentleman
had
been
an
admiring
hearer
of
the
colloquy
from
a
he
tore
back
to
the
on
the
approach
of
his
father
hastily
deciding
that
he
must
bear
out
cyril
in
the
denial
now
george
said
dare
sternly
did
you
and
cyril
do
this
or
did
you
not
of
course
we
did
not
papa
was
the
ready
reply
we
have
not
been
near
markham
brooks
must
be
a
fool
dare
believed
him
he
was
leaving
the
room
when
miss
benyon
interposed
sir
i
should
be
doing
wrong
to
allow
you
to
be
deceived
they
did
break
the
window
the
address
caused
dare
to
pause
how
do
you
know
it
miss
benyon
miss
benyon
related
what
had
passed
dare
cast
his
eyes
sternly
upon
his
youngest
son
it
is
you
who
are
the
fool
george
not
brooks
a
lie
is
sure
to
get
found
out
in
the
end
do
attempt
to
tell
another
dare
went
down
i
can
not
come
quite
to
the
bottom
of
this
business
markham
said
he
feeling
unwilling
to
expose
his
sons
more
than
they
had
exposed
themselves
at
all
events
you
shall
have
the
window
put
in
a
pane
of
glass
is
not
much
on
either
side
it
is
a
good
deal
to
my
pocket
dare
but
that
all
i
ask
and
you
know
my
character
too
well
to
fear
i
would
make
a
doubtful
claim
brooks
is
open
to
inquiry
he
departed
and
dare
touched
cyril
on
the
arm
come
with
me
he
took
him
into
the
room
and
there
ensued
an
angry
lecture
cyril
thought
george
had
confessed
and
stood
silent
before
his
father
what
a
sneak
he
must
have
been
thought
cyril
wo
i
serve
him
out
if
you
have
acquired
the
habit
of
speaking
falsely
you
had
better
relinquish
it
resumed
dare
it
will
not
be
a
recommendation
in
the
eyes
of
mr
ashley
i
am
not
going
to
ashley
burst
forth
cyril
for
the
mention
of
the
subject
was
sure
to
anger
him
turn
manufacturer
indeed
rather
you
rather
be
a
gentleman
at
large
interrupted
dare
but
he
sarcastically
added
gentlemen
require
something
to
live
upon
listen
cyril
one
of
the
finest
openings
that
i
know
of
in
this
city
for
a
young
man
is
in
ashley
manufactory
may
despise
ashley
as
a
manufacturer
but
others
respect
him
he
was
reared
a
gentleman
he
is
regarded
as
one
he
is
wealthy
and
his
business
is
large
and
flourishing
suppose
you
could
drop
into
this
after
him
succeed
to
this
fine
business
its
sole
proprietor
i
can
tell
you
that
you
would
occupy
a
better
position
and
be
in
receipt
of
a
far
larger
income
than
either
anthony
or
herbert
will
be
but
there
no
such
chance
as
that
for
me
debated
cyril
there
is
the
chance
and
that
why
you
are
to
be
placed
there
henry
from
his
infirmity
is
not
to
be
brought
up
to
business
and
there
is
no
other
son
you
will
be
apprenticed
to
ashley
with
a
view
to
succeeding
as
a
son
would
first
of
all
to
a
partnership
with
him
eventually
to
the
whole
now
this
is
the
prospect
before
you
cyril
and
prejudiced
though
you
are
you
must
see
that
it
is
a
fine
one
well
acknowledged
cyril
i
would
object
to
drop
into
a
good
thing
like
that
has
ashley
proposed
it
no
he
has
not
distinctly
proposed
it
but
he
did
admit
when
your
apprenticeship
was
being
spoken
of
that
he
might
be
wanting
somebody
to
succeed
him
he
more
than
hinted
that
whoever
might
be
chosen
to
succeed
him
or
to
be
associated
with
him
must
be
rendered
fit
for
the
connection
by
being
an
estimable
and
a
good
man
one
held
in
honour
by
his
fellow
citizens
no
other
could
be
linked
with
the
name
of
ashley
and
now
sir
what
do
you
think
he
ashley
would
say
to
your
behaviour
cyril
looked
rather
you
will
go
to
ashley
cyril
but
i
wish
you
to
remember
to
remember
always
that
the
ultimate
advantages
will
depend
upon
yourself
and
your
conduct
become
a
good
man
and
there
little
doubt
they
will
be
yours
turn
out
indifferently
and
there
not
the
slightest
chance
for
you
i
sha
succeed
to
any
of
ashley
money
i
suppose
complacently
questioned
cyril
who
somewhat
ignored
the
conditions
and
saw
himself
in
prospective
ashley
successor
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
you
may
succeed
to
replied
dare
in
so
significant
a
tone
as
to
surprise
cyril
henry
ashley
i
should
imagine
to
be
a
doubtful
life
should
anything
happen
to
him
mary
ashley
will
of
course
inherit
all
and
he
will
be
a
fortunate
man
who
shall
get
into
her
good
graces
and
marry
her
it
was
a
broad
hint
to
a
boy
like
cyril
she
such
a
proud
thing
that
mary
ashley
grumbled
he
she
is
a
very
sweet
child
was
the
warm
rejoinder
of
dare
and
cyril
went
upstairs
again
to
his
jam
and
his
interrupted
tea
meanwhile
the
evening
went
on
and
the
was
waiting
for
lord
hawkesley
dare
and
adelaide
were
waiting
for
him
waiting
anxiously
in
elegant
attire
dare
did
not
seem
to
care
whether
he
came
or
not
and
julia
who
was
buried
in
an
easy
chair
with
her
book
would
have
preferred
of
the
two
that
he
stayed
away
between
eight
and
nine
he
arrived
a
little
man
young
fair
with
light
eyes
and
sharp
features
a
somewhat
cynical
expression
habitually
on
his
lips
helstonleigh
in
its
gossip
conjectured
that
he
must
be
making
young
anthony
dare
useful
to
him
in
some
way
or
other
or
he
would
not
have
condescended
to
the
intimacy
for
lord
hawkesley
a
proud
man
by
nature
had
been
reared
as
an
earl
son
and
heir
which
meant
an
exclusiveness
far
greater
in
those
days
than
it
is
in
these
this
was
the
third
evening
visit
he
had
paid
to
dare
had
adelaide
good
looks
any
attraction
for
him
was
beginning
to
think
so
and
to
weave
visions
upon
the
strength
of
it
entrenched
as
the
dares
were
in
their
folly
and
assumption
adelaide
was
blind
to
the
wide
social
gulf
that
lay
between
herself
and
viscount
hawkesley
she
sat
down
at
the
piano
at
his
request
and
sang
an
italian
song
she
had
a
good
voice
and
her
singing
was
better
than
her
italian
accent
lord
hawkesley
stood
by
her
and
looked
over
the
music
i
like
your
style
of
singing
very
much
he
remarked
to
her
when
the
song
was
over
you
must
have
learnt
of
a
good
master
carelessly
rejoined
adelaide
as
is
the
case
with
many
more
young
ladies
who
possess
a
superficial
knowledge
of
french
she
thought
it
the
perfection
of
good
taste
to
display
as
much
of
it
as
she
did
know
i
had
the
best
professor
that
helstonleigh
can
give
but
what
are
helstonleigh
professors
compared
with
those
of
london
we
can
not
expect
talent
here
do
you
like
london
asked
lord
hawkesley
i
was
never
there
replied
adelaide
feeling
the
confession
when
made
to
lord
hawkesley
to
be
nothing
but
a
humiliation
indeed
you
would
enjoy
a
london
season
oh
so
much
i
know
nothing
of
the
london
season
except
from
books
a
contrast
to
your
lordship
you
will
say
she
added
with
a
laugh
you
must
be
almost
tired
of
it
what
that
in
english
inquired
lord
hawkesley
whose
french
studies
as
far
as
they
had
extended
had
been
utterly
thrown
away
upon
him
labouring
under
the
deficiency
he
had
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
did
it
with
a
boast
used
up
i
suppose
you
mean
adelaide
coloured
excessively
she
wondered
if
he
was
laughing
at
her
and
made
a
mental
vow
never
to
speak
french
to
a
lord
again
will
you
think
me
exacting
miss
dare
if
i
trespass
upon
you
for
another
song
adelaide
did
not
think
him
exacting
in
the
least
she
was
ready
to
sing
as
long
as
he
pleased
chapter
charlotte
east
present
towards
dusk
that
same
evening
charlotte
east
went
over
to
buffle
for
some
butter
after
she
was
served
buffle
who
was
a
little
shrimp
of
a
woman
with
a
red
nose
crossed
her
arms
upon
the
counter
and
bent
her
face
towards
charlotte
have
you
heered
the
news
asked
she
mary
ann
cross
is
going
to
make
a
match
of
it
with
ben
tyrrett
is
she
said
charlotte
they
had
better
wait
a
few
years
both
of
them
until
they
shall
have
put
by
something
they
neither
of
them
of
the
sort
returned
buffle
them
crosses
is
the
worst
girls
to
spend
in
all
the
fair
unless
carry
mason
she
do
spare
her
back
she
do
the
wonder
is
how
she
gets
it
young
girls
will
dress
observed
charlotte
carelessly
buffle
laughed
you
speak
as
if
you
were
an
old
one
i
feel
like
one
sometimes
buffle
when
children
are
left
as
i
and
robert
were
with
a
baby
brother
to
bring
up
and
hardly
any
means
to
do
it
upon
it
helps
to
steady
them
tom
eliza
tyrrett
burst
in
at
the
door
with
a
violence
that
made
its
bell
twang
and
tinkle
o
dips
dame
buffle
and
be
quick
about
it
was
her
order
there
such
a
in
at
mason
a
repeated
buffle
who
was
always
ripe
and
ready
for
a
dish
of
scandal
whether
it
touched
on
domestic
differences
or
on
young
girls
improvidence
in
the
shape
of
dress
is
mason
and
her
having
a
noise
it
not
him
and
her
it
about
carry
hetty
mason
locked
carry
up
this
afternoon
and
mason
never
came
home
at
all
to
tea
he
went
and
had
some
beer
instead
and
a
turn
at
skittles
and
she
would
let
carry
out
he
came
in
just
now
and
his
wife
told
him
a
whole
heap
about
carry
and
mason
went
up
to
the
undid
the
door
and
threatened
to
kick
carry
down
they
having
it
out
in
the
kitchen
all
three
what
has
carry
done
asked
buffle
eagerly
perhaps
charlotte
east
can
tell
said
eliza
tyrrett
slyly
she
has
been
thick
with
carry
lately
am
not
to
spoil
sport
charlotte
took
up
her
butter
and
bending
a
severe
look
of
caution
on
the
tyrrett
girl
left
the
shop
anthony
dare
reputation
was
not
a
brilliant
one
and
the
bare
fact
of
caroline
mason
allowing
herself
to
walk
with
him
would
have
damaged
her
in
the
eyes
of
honey
fair
as
well
keep
it
if
possible
from
buffle
and
other
gossips
as
charlotte
crossed
to
her
own
door
she
became
conscious
that
some
one
was
flying
towards
her
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
a
woman
with
a
fleet
foot
and
panting
breath
charlotte
caught
hold
of
her
caroline
where
are
you
going
let
me
alone
charlotte
east
and
caroline
nostrils
were
working
her
eyes
flashing
i
have
left
their
house
for
ever
and
am
going
to
one
who
will
give
me
a
better
charlotte
held
her
tight
you
must
not
go
caroline
i
will
she
defiantly
answered
i
have
chosen
my
lot
this
night
for
better
or
for
worse
will
i
stay
to
be
taunted
without
a
cause
to
be
told
i
am
what
i
am
not
no
if
anything
should
happen
to
me
let
them
reproach
themselves
for
they
have
driven
me
on
to
it
charlotte
tried
her
utmost
to
restrain
the
wild
girl
caroline
she
urged
this
is
the
in
your
life
a
step
forward
and
you
may
have
passed
it
beyond
recall
a
step
backwards
and
you
may
be
saved
for
ever
come
home
with
me
caroline
in
her
madness
it
was
little
else
turned
her
ghastly
face
upon
charlotte
you
sha
stop
me
charlotte
east
you
go
your
way
and
i
go
mine
shall
mark
and
she
go
on
at
me
without
cause
i
say
calling
me
false
names
come
home
with
me
caroline
you
shall
stay
with
me
you
sha
go
back
to
hetty
my
bed
not
large
but
it
will
hold
us
i
wo
i
wo
she
uttered
struggling
to
be
free
only
for
a
minute
implored
charlotte
come
in
for
a
minute
until
you
are
calm
you
are
mad
just
now
i
am
driven
to
it
there
with
a
jerk
she
wrenched
herself
from
charlotte
grasp
passion
giving
her
strength
and
she
flew
onwards
and
was
lost
in
the
dark
night
charlotte
east
ran
home
her
brothers
were
there
tom
said
she
put
this
butter
in
the
cupboard
for
me
and
out
she
went
again
at
the
end
of
honey
fair
a
road
lay
each
way
which
should
she
take
which
had
caroline
taken
she
chose
the
one
to
the
right
it
was
the
most
retired
and
went
groping
about
it
for
twenty
minutes
as
it
happened
as
such
things
generally
do
happen
caroline
had
taken
the
other
in
a
sheltered
part
of
that
which
lay
back
away
from
the
glare
of
the

had
taken
refuge
she
had
expected
some
one
would
be
there
to
meet
her
but
she
found
herself
mistaken
down
she
sat
on
a
stone
and
her
wild
passion
began
to
diminish
nearly
half
an
hour
afterwards
charlotte
found
her
there
caroline
was
talking
to
anthony
dare
who
had
just
come
up
charlotte
grasped
caroline
you
must
come
with
me
caroline
who
on
earth
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
intruding
here
demanded
anthony
dare
turning
round
with
a
fierce
stare
on
charlotte
i
am
charlotte
east
sir
if
it
is
any
matter
to
you
to
know
my
name
and
i
am
a
friend
of
caroline
mason
i
am
here
to
take
her
out
of
harm
way
there
nothing
to
harm
her
here
haughtily
answered
young
anthony
mind
your
own
business
i
am
afraid
there
is
one
thing
to
harm
her
sir
and
that
you
said
brave
charlotte
you
ca
come
among
us
people
in
honey
fair
for
any
good
folks
bent
on
good
errands
do
need
to
wait
till
dark
before
they
pay
their
visits
you
had
better
give
up
prowling
about
this
place
anthony
dare
stay
with
your
equals
sir
with
those
that
will
be
a
match
for
you
the
woman
must
be
deranged
uttered
anthony
going
into
a
terrible
passion
how
dare
you
presume
to
say
such
things
to
me
how
dare
you
sir
set
yourself
out
to
work
ill
retorted
charlotte
come
along
caroline
she
added
to
the
girl
who
was
now
crying
bitterly
as
for
you
sir
if
you
mean
no
harm
as
you
say
and
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
condescend
to
visit
honey
fair
please
to
pay
your
visits
in
the
broad
light
of
day
no
very
pleasant
word
broke
from
anthony
dare
he
would
have
liked
to
exterminate
charlotte
caroline
foamed
he
order
this
woman
away
if
i
could
see
a
policeman
i
give
her
in
charge
sir
if
you
dare
attempt
to
detain
her
i
appeal
to
the
first
i
tell
them
to
look
at
the
great
and
grand
anthony
dare
and
to
ask
him
what
he
wants
here
night
after
night
even
as
charlotte
spoke
footsteps
were
heard
and
two
gentlemen
talking
together
advanced
the
voice
of
one
fell
familiarly
on
the
ear
of
anthony
dare
familiarly
on
that
of
charlotte
east
the
latter
uttered
a
joyful
cry
there
ashley
loose
her
sir
or
i
call
to
him
to
have
ashley
called
to
on
the
point
would
not
be
altogether
agreeable
to
the
feelings
of
young
anthony
you
fool
he
exclaimed
to
charlotte
east
what
harm
do
you
suppose
i
meant
or
thought
of
you
must
be
a
very
strange
person
yourself
to
get
such
a
thing
into
your
imagination
good
night
caroline
and
turning
on
his
heel
haughtily
anthony
dare
stalked
off
in
the
direction
of
helstonleigh
ashley
passed
on
having
noticed
nothing
and
charlotte
east
wound
her
arm
round
the
sobbing
girl
subdued
now
and
led
her
home
anthony
went
straight
to
pomeranian
knoll
and
threw
himself
on
to
a
sofa
in
a
very
ill
humour
lord
hawkesley
was
occupied
with
adelaide
and
her
singing
and
paid
little
attention
to
him
at
the
close
of
the
evening
they
left
together
anthony
going
out
with
lord
hawkesley
and
linking
arms
as
they
proceeded
towards
the
star
hotel
lord
hawkesley
usual
quarters
when
in
helstonleigh
i
have
got
two
hundred
out
of
the
governor
began
anthony
in
a
confidential
tone
he
will
give
me
the
cheque
what
two
hundred
dare
slightingly
spoke
his
lordship
nothing
it
was
of
no
use
trying
for
more
the
two
hundred
will
stop
present
worry
hawkesley
the
future
must
be
provided
for
when
it
comes
and
they
walked
on
with
a
quicker
step
dare
had
looked
at
her
watch
as
they
departed
it
was
eleven
she
said
she
supposed
they
might
as
well
be
going
to
bed
and
dare
roused
himself
for
the
last
he
had
been
quite
asleep
he
did
not
choose
to
fall
in
the
young
man
presence
a
viscount
to
lawyer
dare
was
a
viscount
where
herbert
asked
he
stretching
himself
master
herbert
joseph
answered
had
had
supper
served
not
being
able
to
recover
from
the
short
allowance
at
dinner
and
had
gone
to
bed
the
rest
excepting
adelaide
had
gone
before
free
from
want
from
care
full
of
the
good
things
of
this
life
the
young
halliburtons
their
cousins
once
removed
had
knelt
and
thanked
god
for
the
day
good
even
though
that
day
to
them
had
been
what
all
their
days
were
now
one
of
poverty
and
privation
not
so
the
dares
as
children
for
they
were
not
in
a
heathen
land
they
had
been
taught
to
say
their
prayers
at
night
but
as
they
grew
older
the
custom
was
suffered
to
fall
into
disuse
the
family
attended
church
on
sundays
fashionably
attired
and
there
ended
their
religion
to
bed
and
to
sleep
went
they
all
the
household
old
and
young
joseph
the
manservant
excepted
sleepy
joseph
stretched
himself
in
a
large
chair
to
wait
the
return
of
anthony
sleepy
joseph
had
so
to
stretch
himself
most
nights
anthony
might
come
in
in
an
hour
time
or
anthony
might
not
come
in
until
it
was
nearly
time
to
commence
the
duties
in
the
morning
it
was
all
a
chance
as
poor
joseph
knew
to
his
cost
nine
was
the
breakfast
hour
at
dare
and
the
family
were
in
general
pretty
punctual
at
it
on
the
following
morning
they
were
all
assembled
at
the
meal
anthony
rather
red
about
the
eyes
when
ann
the
housemaid
entered
here
a
parcel
for
you
mr
anthony
she
held
in
her
arms
a
large
untidy
sort
of
bundle
done
round
with
string
anthony
turned
his
wondering
eyes
upon
it
that
it
ca
be
for
me
a
boy
brought
it
and
said
it
was
for
you
sir
returned
ann
letting
the
cumbersome
parcel
fall
on
a
chair
i
asked
if
there
was
any
answer
and
he
said
there
was
not
it
must
be
from
your
tailor
anthony
said
dare
anthony
consequence
was
offended
at
the
suggestion
my
tailor
send
me
a
parcel
done
up
like
that
repeated
he
he
had
better
he
would
get
no
more
of
my
custom
what
an
extraordinary
direction
exclaimed
julia
who
had
got
up
and
drawn
near
in
her
curiosity
mister
antony
dare
just
look
all
of
you
anthony
rose
and
the
rest
followed
except
dare
who
was
busy
with
a
county
paper
and
paid
no
attention
a
happy
thought
darted
into
minny
mind
i
know
she
cried
clapping
her
hands
cyril
and
george
are
playing
anthony
a
trick
like
the
one
they
played
miss
benyon
anthony
too
hastily
taking
up
the
view
thus
suggested
and
inwardly
vowing
a
not
agreeable
chastisement
to
the
two
as
soon
as
they
should
rush
in
to
breakfast
from
school
took
out
his
penknife
and
severed
the
string
the
paper
fell
apart
and
the
contents
rolled
on
to
the
floor
what
on
earth
were
they
what
did
they
mean
a
woman
gown
tawdry
but
pretty
a
shawl
a
with
fringe
two
pairs
of
gloves
the
fingers
worn
into
holes
a
bow
of
handsome
ribbon
a
cameo
brooch
fine
and
false
and
one
or
two
more
such
articles
not
new
stood
disclosed
the
party
around
gazed
in
sheer
amazement
if
ever
i
saw
such
a
collection
as
this
exclaimed
dare
it
is
a
woman
clothing
why
should
they
have
been
sent
to
you
anthony
anthony
cheek
wore
rather
a
conscious
colour
just
then
how
should
i
know
he
replied
they
must
have
been
directed
to
me
by
mistake
take
the
rags
away
ann
spurning
them
with
his
foot
and
throw
them
into
the
who
knows
what
infected
place
they
may
have
come
from
dare
and
the
young
ladies
shrieked
at
the
last
suggestion
gathered
their
skirts
about
them
and
retired
as
far
as
the
limits
of
the
room
allowed
some
enemy
of
malicious
intent
must
have
done
it
they
became
convinced
ann
no
more
liking
to
be
infected
with
measles
or
what
not
than
they
seized
the
tongs
gingerly
lifted
the
articles
inside
the
paper
dragged
the
whole
outside
the
door
and
called
joseph
to
carry
them
to
the
receptacle
indicated
by
anthony
charlotte
east
had
thought
she
would
not
do
her
work
by
halves
chapter
vi
the
fear
growing
greater
we
must
leap
over
some
months
a
story
you
know
can
not
stand
still
any
more
than
we
can
spring
had
come
round
the
sofa
belonging
to
reece
parlour
was
in
halliburton
and
janey
was
lying
on
it
her
blue
eyes
bright
her
cheeks
hectic
her
fair
curls
falling
in
disorder
through
autumn
through
winter
it
had
appeared
that
dobbs
prognostications
of
evil
for
jane
were
not
to
be
borne
out
for
she
had
recovered
from
the
temporary
indications
of
illness
and
had
continued
well
but
with
the
early
spring
weather
jane
failed
and
failed
rapidly
the
cough
came
back
and
great
weakness
grew
upon
her
she
was
always
wanting
to
be
at
rest
and
would
lie
about
anywhere
spreading
a
cloak
on
the
floor
with
a
pillow
for
her
head
janey
would
plant
herself
between
her
mother
and
the
fire
pulling
the
cloak
up
on
the
side
near
the
door
one
day
dobbs
came
in
and
saw
her
there
my
heart
alive
uttered
dobbs
when
she
had
recovered
her
surprise
what
are
you
lying
down
there
for
i
am
tired
replied
janey
and
there
nowhere
else
to
lie
if
i
put
three
chairs
together
it
is
not
comfortable
and
the
pillow
rolls
off
there
the
sofa
in
our
room
said
dobbs
why
do
you
lie
on
that
so
i
do
you
know
dobbs
but
i
want
to
talk
to
mamma
sometimes
dobbs
disappeared
presently
there
was
a
floundering
and
thumping
heard
in
the
passage
and
the
sofa
was
propelled
in
by
dobbs
very
red
with
the
exertion
my
missis
is
indignant
to
think
that
the
child
should
be
upon
the
floor
cried
she
wrathfully
one
would
suppose
some
folks
were
born
without
brains
or
the
sofa
might
have
been
asked
for
but
dobbs
said
janey
and
was
allowed
to
dobbs
as
much
as
she
pleased
unreproved
what
am
i
to
lie
on
in
your
room
is
there
my
easy
chair
with
the
high
in
front
as
good
as
a
bed
when
you
let
it
out
returned
dobbs
proceeding
to
place
janey
comfortably
on
the
sofa
and
now
let
me
say
what
i
came
in
to
say
when
the
sight
of
that
child
on
the
cold
floor
sent
me
shocked
out
again
she
added
turning
to
jane
my
missis
leg
is
no
better
and
she
has
made
up
her
mind
to
have
parry
it
erysipelas
as
sure
as
a
gun
every
other
spring
about
she
laid
up
with
it
in
her
legs
one
or
the
other
of
ten
weeks
i
have
known
her
in
bed
with
it
the
very
best
preventive
to
erysipelas
is
to
take
an
occasional
warm
bath
interrupted
jane
the
suggestion
gave
immense
offence
to
dobbs
a
warm
bath
she
uttered
ironically
and
how
pray
should
my
missis
take
a
warm
bath
sit
down
in
a
and
have
a
furnace
of
boiling
water
turned
on
to
her
those
notions
may
do
for
londoners
but
they
are
not
known
at
helstonleigh
warm
baths
repeated
dobbs
with
increased
scorn
had
you
better
propose
a
at
once
i
have
heard
that
they
are
inventing
also
i
have
heard
so
too
pleasantly
replied
jane
well
my
missis
is
going
to
have
parry
up
and
she
intends
that
he
shall
see
janey
and
give
her
some
physic
if
physic
will
be
of
use
added
dobbs
with
an
incredulous
sniff
my
missis
says
it
will
she
puts
faith
in
parry
physic
as
if
it
was
gold
it
a
good
thing
not
ill
often
or
she
let
herself
be
poisoned
if
quantity
could
poison
her
and
janey
you
take
the
physic
like
a
precious
lamb
and
heaps
of
nice
things
you
shall
have
after
it
to
drive
the
taste
out
warm
baths
ejaculated
dobbs
as
she
went
out
returning
to
the
old
grievance
i
wonder
what
the
world
coming
to
parry
was
called
in
and
soon
had
his
two
regular
patients
there
reece
was
confined
to
her
bed
with
erysipelas
in
her
leg
and
if
janey
seemed
better
one
day
she
seemed
worse
the
next
the
surgeon
did
not
say
what
was
the
matter
with
jane
he
ordered
her
everything
good
in
the
shape
of
food
he
particularly
ordered
port
wine
an
hour
after
the
latter
order
had
been
given
dobbs
appeared
with
a
full
decanter
in
her
hand
it
two
glasses
a
day
that
she
is
to
take
one
at
eleven
and
one
at
three
cried
she
without
circumlocution
but
indeed
i
can
not
think
of
accepting
so
costly
a
thing
from
reece
as
port
wine
interrupted
jane
in
consternation
you
can
do
as
you
like
said
dobbs
with
equanimity
janey
will
accept
it
she
drink
her
two
glasses
of
wine
daily
if
i
have
to
come
and
drench
her
with
it
and
it
wo
be
any
cost
out
of
my
pocket
if
that
what
you
are
thinking
of
logically
proceeded
dobbs
parry
says
it
will
be
a
good
three
months
before
she
can
take
her
wine
again
so
janey
can
drink
it
for
her
if
my
missis
grudged
her
port
wine
or
was
cramped
in
pocket
i
should
not
take
my
one
glass
a
day
which
i
do
regular
i
can
never
repay
you
and
reece
for
your
kindness
and
generosity
to
jane
sighed
halliburton
you
can
do
it
when
you
are
asked
was
dobbs
retort
there
the
wing
and
merrythought
of
a
fowl
coming
in
for
her
dinner
with
a
bit
of
sweet
boiled
pork
i
do
give
myself
the
ceremony
of
now
my
missis
is
in
bed
but
just
eat
it
in
the
rough
so
the
child
had
better
have
hers
brought
in
here
comfortably
till
my
missis
is
down
again
and
janey
you
come
upstairs
to
tea
to
us
i
have
taken
up
the
easy
chair
thank
you
very
much
dobbs
said
janey
and
do
you
let
them
cormorants
be
eating
her
dinners
or
drinking
her
wine
said
dobbs
fiercely
as
she
was
going
out
keep
a
sharp
upon
they
would
not
do
it
warmly
replied
jane
you
do
not
know
my
boys
yet
if
you
think
they
would
rob
their
sick
sister
i
know
that
boys
stomachs
are
always
on
the
crave
for
anything
good
retorted
dobbs
you
might
skin
a
boy
if
you
were
forced
to
it
but
you
never
drive
his
nature
out
of
him
and
that
to
be
always
eating
so
she
had
even
help
port
wine
it
seemed
almost
beyond
belief
and
jane
lost
herself
in
thought
mamma
you
do
hear
me
did
you
speak
janey
i
say
i
think
dobbs
got
that
fowl
for
me
reece
is
not
taking
meat
and
dobbs
would
not
buy
a
fowl
for
herself
she
will
give
me
all
the
best
parts
and
pick
the
bones
herself
you
see
how
kind
they
are
to
me
what
should
i
have
done
mamma
if
i
had
only
our
plain
food
i
know
i
could
not
eat
it
now
god
is
over
us
my
dear
child
was
jane
reply
it
is
he
who
has
directed
this
help
to
us
never
doubt
it
jane
whether
we
live
or
die
she
added
pointedly
we
are
in
his
hands
and
he
orders
all
things
for
the
best
can
to
die
be
for
the
best
asked
janey
sitting
up
to
think
over
the
question
why
yes
my
dear
girl
certainly
it
is
if
god
wills
it
how
often
have
i
talked
to
you
about
the
rest
after
the
grave
no
more
tears
no
more
partings
which
is
best
to
be
here
or
to
go
to
that
rest
oh
janey
we
can
put
up
surely
with
illness
and
with
crosses
here
if
we
may
only
attain
to
that
this
world
will
last
only
for
a
little
while
at
best
but
that
other
will
abide
for
ever
and
for
ever
a
summons
from
parry
boy
miss
halliburton
medicine
had
arrived
miss
halliburton
made
a
grievous
face
over
it
when
her
mamma
poured
the
dose
out
i
never
take
it
it
smells
so
nasty
jane
held
the
towards
her
a
grave
kind
smile
upon
her
face
my
darling
it
is
one
of
earth
little
crosses
and
not
rebel
against
it
here
a
bit
of
patience
jam
left
to
take
after
it
janey
smiled
bravely
as
she
took
the
glass
it
was
not
so
bad
as
i
thought
mamma
said
she
when
she
had
swallowed
it
of
course
not
janey
nothing
is
that
we
set
about
with
a
brave
heart
but
with
every
good
thing
janey
did
not
improve
her
mother
shrank
from
admitting
the
fact
that
was
growing
only
too
palpable
and
dobbs
would
come
in
and
sit
looking
at
janey
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
together
never
speaking
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
dobbs
asked
janey
one
day
suddenly
you
were
crying
when
you
looked
at
me
last
night
at
dusk
dobbs
was
rather
taken
to
i
had
been
peeling
onions
said
she
why
do
you
shrink
from
looking
at
the
truth
an
inward
voice
kept
repeating
in
halliburton
heart
is
it
right
or
wise
or
well
to
do
so
no
she
knew
that
it
could
not
be
that
same
day
after
parry
had
paid
his
visit
to
reece
he
looked
in
upon
janey
am
i
getting
better
she
asked
him
i
want
to
go
into
the
green
fields
again
and
run
about
ah
said
he
we
must
wait
for
that
little
maid
jane
went
out
to
the
door
with
him
when
he
put
out
his
hand
to
say
good
morning
he
saw
that
she
was
white
with
emotion
and
could
not
speak
readily
will
she
live
or
die
mr
parry
was
the
whispered
question
that
came
at
last
now
do
distress
yourself
halliburton
in
these
lingering
cases
we
must
be
content
to
wait
the
issue
whatever
it
may
be
i
have
had
so
much
trouble
of
one
sort
or
another
that
i
think
i
have
become
inured
to
it
she
continued
striving
to
speak
more
calmly
these
several
days
past
i
have
been
deciding
to
ask
you
the
truth
if
i
am
to
lose
her
it
will
be
better
that
i
should
know
it
beforehand
it
will
be
easier
for
me
to
bear
she
is
in
danger
is
she
not
yes
he
replied
i
fear
she
is
is
there
any
hope
well
you
know
halliburton
while
there
is
life
there
is
hope
his
tone
was
kindly
but
she
could
not
well
mistake
that
of
human
hope
there
was
none
her
lips
were
pale
her
bosom
was
heaving
i
understand
she
murmured
tell
me
one
other
thing
how
near
is
the
end
that
i
really
can
not
tell
you
he
more
readily
replied
these
cases
vary
much
in
their
progression
do
not
be
downcast
halliburton
we
must
every
one
of
us
go
sooner
or
later
sometimes
i
wish
i
could
see
all
mine
gone
before
me
rather
than
leave
them
behind
to
the
cares
of
this
troublesome
world
he
shook
hands
and
departed
jane
crept
softly
upstairs
to
her
own
room
and
was
shut
in
for
ten
minutes
poor
thing
could
not
spare
time
for
the
indulgence
of
grief
as
others
might
she
must
hasten
to
her
work
she
had
her
task
to
do
and
ten
minutes
lost
from
it
in
the
day
must
be
made
up
at
night
as
she
was
going
downstairs
with
red
eyes
reece
heard
her
footstep
and
called
to
her
from
her
bed
is
that
you
so
jane
had
to
go
in
are
you
better
she
inquired
no
i
do
see
much
improvement
replied
the
old
lady
parry
is
going
to
change
the
lotion
but
it
a
thing
that
will
have
its
course
how
is
janey
does
he
say
she
is
much
the
same
said
jane
she
grows
no
better
i
fear
she
never
will
ay
so
dobbs
says
and
it
strikes
me
parry
has
told
her
so
now
you
spare
nothing
that
can
do
her
good
whatever
she
fancies
tell
dobbs
and
it
shall
be
had
i
would
not
for
the
world
have
a
dying
child
stinted
while
i
can
help
it
do
spare
wine
do
spare
anything
a
dying
child
the
words
in
spite
of
jane
previous
convictions
nay
her
knowledge
caused
her
heart
to
sink
with
a
chill
she
proceeded
as
she
had
done
many
times
before
to
express
a
tithe
of
her
gratitude
to
reece
for
the
substantial
kindness
shown
to
janey
do
say
anything
about
it
returned
the
old
lady
in
her
simple
straightforward
way
i
have
neither
chick
nor
child
of
my
own
and
both
i
and
dobbs
have
taken
a
liking
for
janey
we
ca
think
anything
we
can
do
too
much
for
her
i
have
spoken
to
parry
therefore
do
spare
his
services
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
send
for
him
if
you
deem
it
necessary
with
another
attempt
at
heartfelt
thanks
jane
went
down
full
as
her
cup
was
to
the
brim
she
was
yet
overwhelmed
with
the
sense
of
kindness
shown
from
that
time
she
set
herself
to
the
task
of
preparing
janey
for
the
great
change
by
gradual
degrees
a
little
now
a
little
then
to
make
her
long
for
the
translation
to
that
better
land
one
evening
about
eight
patience
entered
partly
to
inquire
after
janey
partly
to
ask
william
if
he
would
go
to
bring
anna
from
ashley
where
she
had
been
taking
tea
samuel
lynn
was
detained
in
the
town
on
business
and
grace
had
been
permitted
to
go
out
therefore
patience
had
no
one
to
send
william
left
his
books
and
went
out
with
alacrity
patience
sat
down
by
janey
sofa
i
get
so
tired
patience
i
wish
i
had
some
pretty
books
to
read
i
have
read
all
anna
over
and
over
again
and
she
wo
eat
solids
now
and
she
grows
tired
of
and
sago
and
and
those
things
put
in
dobbs
in
an
injured
tone
who
was
also
sitting
there
i
would
try
her
with
a
little
made
with
plenty
of
carrots
and
thickened
with
arrowroot
said
patience
made
with
carrots
and
thickened
with
arrowroot
ungraciously
responded
dobbs
who
held
in
contempt
every
one
cooking
except
her
own
i
can
tell
thee
that
it
is
one
of
the
nicest
things
taken
said
patience
it
might
be
a
change
for
the
child
how
it
made
asked
dobbs
it
might
do
for
my
missis
tired
of
mutton
broth
slice
a
pound
of
lean
beef
and
let
it
soak
for
two
hours
in
a
quart
of
cold
water
replied
patience
then
put
meat
and
water
into
a
saucepan
with
a
couple
of
large
carrots
scraped
and
sliced
let
it
warm
gradually
and
then
simmer
for
about
four
hours
thee
putting
salt
to
taste
strain
it
off
and
when
cold
take
off
the
fat
as
the
broth
is
wanted
stir
it
up
and
take
from
it
as
much
as
may
be
required
boiling
the
portion
for
a
minute
with
a
little
arrowroot
dobbs
condescended
to
intimate
that
perhaps
she
might
try
it
though
she
be
bound
it
was
poor
stuff
william
had
hastened
to
ashley
he
was
shown
into
a
room
to
wait
for
anna
and
his
attention
was
immediately
attracted
by
a
shelf
full
of
children
he
knew
they
were
just
what
janey
was
longing
for
he
had
taken
some
in
his
hand
when
anna
came
in
ready
for
him
accompanied
by
ashley
mary
and
henry
then
william
became
aware
of
the
liberty
he
had
taken
in
touching
the
things
and
in
his
the
colour
as
usual
rushed
to
his
face
it
was
a
frank
ingenuous
face
with
its
fair
open
forehead
and
its
earnest
dark
grey
eyes
and
ashley
thought
it
so
were
you
looking
at
our
books
asked
henry
who
was
in
a
remarkably
good
humour
i
am
sorry
to
have
touched
them
replied
william
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
i
would
be
nearly
sure
thee
were
thinking
of
thy
sister
cried
anna
who
had
an
tongue
yes
i
was
replied
william
candidly
i
was
wishing
she
could
read
them
i
have
told
her
about
the
books
said
anna
turning
from
william
to
the
rest
i
related
to
her
as
much
as
i
could
remember
of
ross
that
book
which
thee
had
in
thy
hand
william
she
would
so
like
to
read
them
she
is
always
is
she
very
ill
inquired
ashley
she
is
dying
replied
anna
it
was
the
first
intimation
william
had
received
of
the
great
fear
his
countenance
changed
his
heart
beat
wildly
oh
anna
who
says
it
he
cried
out
in
a
low
wailing
tone
there
was
a
dead
silence
anna
announcement
sounded
sufficiently
startling
and
ashley
looked
with
sympathy
at
the
evidently
agitated
boy
there
that
my
tongue
cried
anna
repentantly
patience
says
she
wonders
some
one
does
not
cut
it
out
for
me
mary
ashley
a
fair
gentle
little
girl
with
large
brown
eyes
like
henry
stepped
forward
full
of
sympathy
i
have
heard
of
your
sister
from
anna
she
said
she
is
welcome
to
read
all
my
books
you
can
take
some
to
her
now
and
change
them
as
often
as
you
like
how
pleased
william
was
mary
selected
four
and
gave
them
to
him
anna
ross
the
blind
farmer
theophilus
and
sophia
and
margaret
white
very
old
some
of
the
books
and
childish
but
admirably
suited
to
what
people
were
beginning
to
call
jane
a
dying
child
i
say
cried
out
henry
a
little
aristocratic
patronage
in
his
tone
as
william
was
departing
how
do
you
get
on
with
your
latin
i
get
on
very
well
not
quite
so
fast
as
i
should
with
a
master
i
have
to
puzzle
out
difficulties
for
myself
and
i
am
not
sure
but
that
one
of
the
best
ways
to
get
on
i
go
on
with
my
greek
too
and
euclid
and
how
much
time
do
you
work
burst
forth
henry
from
six
till
nine
a
little
of
the
time
i
am
helping
my
brothers
there
perseverance
henry
cried
ashley
and
master
henry
shrugged
his
shoulders
anna
began
william
as
they
walked
along
how
do
you
know
that
janey
is
so
ill
now
william
thee
must
ask
thy
mother
whether
she
is
ill
or
not
she
may
get
well
how
do
i
know
she
was
ill
last
summer
and
hannah
dobbs
would
have
it
she
was
in
a
bad
way
then
but
she
recovered
dost
thee
know
what
patience
says
what
asked
william
eagerly
patience
says
i
have
ten
ears
where
i
ought
to
have
two
and
i
think
thee
hast
the
same
fare
thee
well
she
added
as
they
reached
her
door
thank
thee
for
coming
for
me
william
waited
at
the
gate
until
anna
was
admitted
and
then
hastened
home
jane
was
alone
working
as
usual
mamma
is
it
true
that
janey
is
dying
jane
heart
gave
a
leap
and
poor
william
as
she
saw
could
scarcely
speak
for
agitation
who
told
you
that
she
asked
in
low
tones
anna
lynn
it
true
william
i
fear
it
may
be
do
grieve
child
do
grieve
william
had
laid
his
head
down
upon
the
table
the
sobs
breaking
forth
his
poor
mother
left
her
seat
and
bent
her
head
down
beside
him
sobbing
also
william
for
my
sake
do
grieve
she
whispered
god
alone
knows
what
is
good
he
would
not
take
her
unless
it
were
for
the
best
chapter
vii
the
end
april
passed
may
was
passing
and
the
end
of
jane
halliburton
was
at
hand
there
was
no
secret
now
about
her
state
but
she
was
going
away
very
peacefully
in
this
month
may
there
occurred
another
vacancy
in
the
choir
of
the
cathedral
little
gar
but
he
was
growing
too
big
now
to
be
called
little
gar
proved
to
be
the
successful
candidate
so
that
both
boys
were
now
in
the
choir
it
will
be
such
a
help
to
me
learning
to
chant
should
i
ever
try
for
a
minor
canonry
boasted
gar
who
never
tired
of
telling
them
that
he
meant
to
be
a
clergyman
gar
dear
did
you
ever
sit
down
and
count
the
cost
asked
halliburton
i
fear
it
will
not
be
your
luck
to
go
to
college
labor
omnia
vincit
cried
out
gar
you
have
heard
us
stumbling
over
our
latin
often
enough
mamma
to
know
what
that
means
frank
will
need
to
count
the
cost
too
if
he
is
ever
to
make
himself
into
a
barrister
and
he
says
he
be
one
oh
you
two
vain
boys
cried
jane
laughing
mamma
spoke
up
janey
from
the
sofa
and
her
breathing
was
laboured
now
is
there
harm
in
their
wishing
this
not
at
all
they
are
laudable
aims
only
frank
and
gar
are
so
poor
and
friendless
that
i
fear
the
hopes
are
too
ambitious
to
end
in
anything
but
disappointment
janey
called
gar
to
her
and
pulled
his
face
down
to
a
level
with
hers
whispering
softly
strive
well
gar
and
trust
in
god
later
when
jane
had
to
be
out
on
an
indispensable
errand
dobbs
came
in
to
sit
with
janey
she
brought
her
some
jelly
in
a
saucer
i
am
nearly
tired
of
it
dobbs
said
janey
i
grow
tired
of
everything
and
i
do
like
to
say
so
because
it
seems
so
ungrateful
it
the
nature
of
illness
to
get
tired
of
things
responded
dobbs
who
thought
it
was
her
mission
never
to
cease
buoying
janey
up
with
hope
you
be
better
when
the
hot
weather
comes
in
no
i
sha
dobbs
i
shall
never
get
better
now
a
combination
of
feelings
indignation
predominating
nearly
took
away
dobbs
breath
who
on
earth
has
been
putting
that
grim
notion
in
your
head
asked
she
it
is
true
dobbs
true
ejaculated
dobbs
who
has
been
saying
it
to
you
i
want
to
know
that
mamma
for
one
she
of
all
the
stupids
burst
forth
dobbs
drowning
what
janey
was
about
to
say
to
frighten
the
child
by
telling
her
she
going
to
die
it
does
not
frighten
me
dobbs
i
like
to
lie
and
think
of
it
dobbs
fell
into
a
doubt
whether
janey
was
in
her
senses
like
to
lie
and
think
of
being
screwed
down
in
a
coffin
and
put
into
the
cold
ground
and
left
there
till
the
judgment
day
uttered
she
oh
but
dobbs
you
must
know
better
than
that
returned
jane
are
not
put
into
the
coffin
it
is
only
our
bodies
that
are
put
into
the
coffin
we
go
into
the
world
of
departed
spirits
what
ejaculated
dobbs
whose
notions
of
the
future
the
life
after
this
life
were
not
very
definite
and
who
could
not
have
been
more
astonished
had
jane
begun
to
talk
to
her
in
greek
mamma
has
always
tried
to
explain
these
things
to
us
said
jane
she
has
made
them
as
clear
to
us
as
they
can
be
made
and
she
has
taught
us
not
to
fear
death
she
says
a
great
mistake
is
often
made
by
those
who
bring
up
children
they
are
taught
to
run
away
from
death
as
something
gloomy
and
frightful
instead
of
being
shown
its
bright
side
well
i
never
heard
the
like
exclaimed
dobbs
lost
in
wonder
how
can
there
be
a
bright
side
to
death
in
a
horrid
coffin
with
brass
nails
and
that
screw
you
down
tears
filled
janey
eyes
oh
dobbs
you
must
learn
better
than
that
or
how
will
you
ever
be
reconciled
to
death
do
you
know
that
when
we
die
we
our
spirit
that
is
for
it
is
our
spirit
that
lives
and
thinks
leave
our
body
behind
us
there
no
more
consciousness
in
our
body
and
it
is
put
into
the
grave
till
the
last
day
it
is
like
the
shell
that
the
silkworm
casts
away
when
it
comes
into
the
moth
the
life
is
in
the
moth
not
in
the
shell
you
can
not
think
what
trouble
mamma
has
taken
with
us
always
to
explain
these
things
and
she
has
talked
to
me
so
much
lately
and
where
does
the
spirit
go
by
which
i
suppose
you
mean
the
soul
asked
dobbs
janey
shook
her
head
to
express
her
ignorance
at
the
best
it
is
all
a
mystery
she
said
but
mamma
has
taught
us
to
believe
that
there
a
place
for
the
departed
and
that
we
shall
be
there
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
soul
a
thing
of
life
could
be
boxed
up
in
a
coffin
dobbs
when
jesus
christ
said
to
the
thief
on
the
cross
shalt
thou
be
with
me
in
paradise
he
meant
that
world
it
is
a
place
of
light
and
rest
and
the
good
and
bad
are
there
together
again
janey
shook
her
head
do
you
remember
in
the
parable
of
the
rich
man
and
the
beggar
there
was
a
great
gulf
between
them
and
abraham
said
that
it
could
not
be
passed
i
dare
say
it
will
be
very
peaceful
and
happy
there
quite
different
from
this
world
where
so
much
trouble
and
sickness
why
should
i
be
afraid
of
death
dobbs
dobbs
sat
looking
at
her
and
was
some
minutes
before
she
spoke
not
afraid
to
die
she
slowly
said
well
i
should
be
janey
eyes
were
wet
nobody
need
be
afraid
to
die
when
they
have
learnt
to
trust
in
god
do
you
know
she
answered
with
something
like
enthusiasm
that
many
people
when
dying
have
seen
jesus
waiting
for
them
what
does
it
matter
then
where
our
bodies
are
put
we
are
going
to
be
with
jesus
indeed
dobbs
there
nothing
sad
in
dying
if
you
only
can
look
at
it
in
the
right
way
it
is
those
who
look
at
it
in
the
wrong
way
that
are
afraid
to
die
the
child
as
learned
as
a
minister
was
dobbs
inward
comment
ours
told
us
last
sunday
evening
at
chapel
that
we
were
all
on
the
high
road
to
perdition
i
rather
listen
to
her
creed
than
to
his
it
sounds
more
encouraging
their
ma
has
brought
up
amiss
and
that
the
truth
the
soliloquy
was
interrupted
by
the
return
of
halliburton
almost
immediately
afterwards
some
visitors
came
in
mary
ashley
and
anna
lynn
it
was
the
first
time
mary
had
been
there
and
she
had
come
to
bring
janey
some
more
books
she
was
one
of
those
graceful
children
whom
it
is
pleasant
to
look
at
a
contrast
in
attire
she
presented
to
the
little
quakeress
with
her
silk
dress
her
straw
hat
trimmed
with
a
wreath
of
flowers
and
white
ribbons
her
dark
curls
falling
beneath
it
she
was
much
younger
than
her
brother
henry
but
there
was
a
great
resemblance
between
them
in
the
refined
features
the
bright
complexion
and
the
soft
dark
eyes
somehow
through
a
remark
made
by
dobbs
the
conversation
turned
upon
jane
inability
to
recover
and
mary
ashley
heard
with
extreme
wonder
that
death
was
not
dreaded
her
ma
has
taught
her
different
was
dobbs
comment
mamma
takes
great
pains
with
us
observed
mary
but
i
should
not
like
to
die
how
is
it
she
added
turning
to
halliburton
jane
is
not
much
older
than
i
and
yet
she
does
not
dread
it
my
dear
was
the
reply
i
think
it
is
simply
this
those
whom
god
is
intending
to
take
from
the
world
he
often
in
his
mercy
and
wisdom
weans
from
the
love
of
it
you
are
healthy
and
strong
and
the
world
is
pleasant
to
you
jane
has
been
so
long
weak
and
ill
that
she
no
longer
finds
enjoyment
in
it
and
this
naturally
causes
her
to
look
beyond
this
world
to
the
rest
and
peace
of
the
next
all
things
are
well
ordered
mary
ashley
began
to
think
they
must
be
chattering
anna
vain
anna
sat
gazing
at
mary
pretty
hat
her
drooping
curls
none
except
anna
herself
knew
with
what
envious
longing
anna
at
any
rate
was
not
tired
of
the
world
the
end
grew
nearer
and
nearer
there
came
a
day
when
jane
did
not
get
up
there
came
a
second
and
a
third
on
the
fourth
morning
janey
who
had
passed
a
comfortable
night
compared
with
some
nights
which
had
preceded
it
was
sitting
up
in
bed
when
her
brothers
came
in
from
school
they
hurried
over
their
breakfast
and
ran
up
to
her
carrying
the
remains
of
it
in
their
hands
the
first
few
minutes
after
breakfast
had
always
been
devoted
by
jane
to
reading
to
her
children
in
spite
of
her
necessity
for
close
working
they
were
so
devoted
still
i
will
read
here
this
morning
she
observed
as
the
boys
stood
around
the
bed
mamma
interrupted
janey
read
about
the
holy
city
in
the
book
of
revelation
halliburton
turned
to
the
chapter
and
had
read
to
the
verse
and
the
city
had
no
need
of
the
sun
neither
of
the
moon
to
shine
in
it
for
the
glory
of
god
did
lighten
it
and
the
lamb
is
the
light
thereof
when
jane
suddenly
started
forward
in
bed
her
eyes
fixed
on
some
opposite
point
halliburton
paused
and
endeavoured
to
put
her
gently
back
again
oh
mamma
do
keep
me
she
said
in
a
strangely
thrilling
tone
do
keep
me
i
see
the
light
i
see
papa
there
was
a
strange
light
not
as
of
earth
in
her
own
face
an
ineffable
smile
on
her
lip
that
told
more
of
heaven
her
arms
dropped
and
she
sank
back
on
the
pillow
jane
halliburton
had
gone
to
her
heavenly
father
it
may
be
also
to
her
earthly
one
gar
screamed
dobbs
arrived
in
the
midst
of
the
commotion
and
when
dobbs
saw
what
had
happened
she
fell
into
a
storm
of
anger
of
passionate
sobs
half
ready
to
knock
down
halliburton
with
words
and
the
poor
boys
with
blows
why
was
she
not
called
to
see
the
last
of
her
the
only
young
thing
she
had
cared
for
in
all
the
world
and
yet
she
could
not
be
allowed
to
wish
her
farewell
she
never
love
another
again
as
long
as
her
days
lasted
in
vain
they
strove
to
explain
to
her
that
it
was
sudden
unexpected
momentary
dobbs
would
not
listen
halliburton
stole
away
from
dobbs
storm
anywhere
her
heart
was
brimful
although
she
had
known
that
this
must
be
the
ending
now
that
it
had
come
she
was
as
one
unprepared
in
her
grief
and
sorrow
she
was
tempted
for
a
moment
but
only
for
a
moment
to
question
the
goodness
and
wisdom
of
god
some
one
called
to
her
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
she
went
down
she
had
to
go
down
she
could
not
shut
herself
up
as
those
can
who
have
servants
to
be
their
deputies
anna
lynn
stood
there
dressed
for
school
friend
jane
halliburton
patience
has
sent
me
to
ask
after
janey
this
morning
is
she
better
no
anna
she
is
dead
jane
spoke
with
unnatural
calmness
the
child
scared
at
the
words
backed
away
out
at
the
garden
door
and
then
flew
to
patience
with
the
news
it
brought
patience
in
jane
was
nearly
prostrate
then
nay
but
thee
art
grieving
sadly
thee
must
not
take
on
so
oh
patience
why
should
it
be
she
wailed
aloud
in
her
despair
and
bereavement
anna
left
in
health
and
joyousness
my
child
taken
surely
god
is
dealing
hardly
with
me
thee
must
not
say
that
returned
patience
gravely
but
thee
art
not
thyself
just
now
what
truth
was
it
that
i
heard
thee
impress
upon
thy
child
not
a
week
ago
that
god
ways
are
not
as
our
ways
chapter
viii
a
wedding
in
honey
fair
but
that
such
contrasts
are
all
too
common
in
life
you
might
think
it
scarcely
seemly
to
go
direct
from
a
house
of
death
to
a
house
of
marriage
this
same
morning
which
witnessed
the
death
of
jane
halliburton
witnessed
also
the
wedding
of
mary
ann
cross
and
ben
tyrrett
upon
which
there
was
wonderful
rejoicing
at
the
house
of
course
whether
a
wedding
was
a
good
one
or
a
bad
one
speaking
from
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
it
was
equally
the
custom
to
feast
over
it
in
honey
fair
benjamin
tyrrett
was
only
what
is
called
a
jobber
in
the
glove
trade
earning
fifteen
or
sixteen
shillings
a
week
but
mary
ann
cross
made
up
her
mind
to
have
him
in
defiance
of
parental
and
other
admonitions
that
she
ought
to
look
over
ben
head
they
had
gone
to
work
honey
fair
fashion
preparing
nothing
every
shilling
that
mary
ann
cross
could
spare
went
in
finery
had
long
gone
in
finery
in
vain
charlotte
east
impressed
upon
her
the
necessity
of
saving
of
waiting
mary
ann
would
do
neither
one
nor
the
other
all
that
you
can
spare
from
back
debts
and
from
present
actual
wants
you
should
put
by
charlotte
had
urged
you
do
know
how
many
more
calls
there
are
for
money
after
marriage
than
before
it
there
be
two
of
us
to
earn
it
then
logically
replied
mary
ann
and
two
of
you
to
live
said
charlotte
to
marry
upon
nothing
is
to
rush
into
trouble
how
you
do
go
on
charlotte
east
he
earn
his
wages
and
i
shall
earn
mine
where
be
the
trouble
i
sha
want
to
spend
so
much
upon
my
back
when
i
am
married
to
marry
as
you
are
going
to
do
must
bring
trouble
persisted
charlotte
he
will
manage
to
get
together
a
few
bits
of
cheap
furniture
just
what
you
ca
do
without
to
put
into
one
room
and
there
you
will
be
set
up
neither
of
you
having
one
sixpence
laid
by
to
fall
back
upon
and
perhaps
the
furniture
unpaid
hanging
like
a
log
upon
you
what
shall
you
do
when
children
come
mary
ann
mary
ann
cross
giggled
if
ever
i
heard
the
like
of
you
charlotte
if
children
do
come
they
must
come
that
all
we
ca
send
back
again
no
you
ca
said
charlotte
they
generally
arrive
in
pretty
good
troops
and
sometimes
there
little
to
welcome
them
on
half
the
quarrels
between
man
and
wife
in
our
class
of
life
spring
from
nothing
but
large
families
and
small
means
their
tempers
get
soured
with
each
other
and
never
get
pleased
again
folks
must
take
their
chance
charlotte
there
no
in
it
you
are
nineteen
ben
tyrrett
suppose
you
made
up
your
minds
to
wait
two
or
three
years
you
would
be
quite
young
enough
then
and
meanwhile
if
both
of
you
laid
by
you
would
have
something
in
hand
to
meet
extra
expenses
or
sickness
if
it
came
opinions
differs
shortly
returned
mary
ann
if
folks
tell
true
you
were
putting
by
ever
so
long
for
your
marriage
and
it
all
ended
in
smoke
i
rather
make
sure
of
a
husband
when
i
can
get
him
an
expression
of
pain
crossed
the
face
of
charlotte
east
whether
i
marry
or
not
she
answered
calmly
i
shall
be
none
the
worse
for
having
laid
money
by
instead
of
squandering
it
if
the
best
man
that
ever
was
born
came
to
me
i
would
not
marry
him
if
we
had
made
no
better
provision
for
a
rainy
day
than
you
and
tyrrett
have
what
can
come
of
such
unions
mary
ann
it
the
way
most
of
us
girls
do
marry
returned
mary
ann
and
what
comes
of
it
i
ask
sometimes
mary
ann
the
workhouse
sometimes
trouble
always
is
it
true
that
you
put
by
charlotte
yes
i
put
by
what
i
can
but
how
in
wonder
do
you
manage
it
you
dress
as
well
as
we
do
sure
our
backs
take
all
our
money
father
pretty
nigh
keeps
the
house
i
dress
better
than
you
in
one
sense
mary
ann
i
do
have
on
a
silk
gown
one
day
and
a
petticoat
in
rags
the
next
no
one
ever
sees
me
otherwise
than
neat
and
clean
and
my
clothes
keep
good
a
long
while
it
the
finery
that
runs
away
with
your
money
i
am
not
ashamed
to
make
a
bonnet
last
two
years
you
have
two
in
a
season
another
thing
mary
ann
i
do
not
waste
my
time
i
sit
to
my
work
and
i
dare
say
i
earn
double
what
you
do
let
us
hear
what
you
earned
last
week
if
it
is
impertinent
was
mary
ann
answer
ten
and
ninepence
look
at
that
cried
the
girl
lifting
her
hands
i
brought
out
but
five
and
twopence
and
i
left
no
money
for
silk
and
am
in
debt
two
quarterns
was
worse
hers
came
to
four
and
eleven
that
surly
old
foreman
says
to
me
when
he
was
paying
d
leave
for
silk
mary
ann
cross
there
two
quarterns
down
know
there
is
sir
says
i
i
do
leave
nothing
he
gave
a
grunt
at
that
the
old
file
did
and
i
suppose
you
spent
your
five
shillings
in
some
useless
thing
i
had
to
pay
up
at
bankes
and
the
rest
went
in
a
new
peach
peach
you
should
have
bought
white
if
you
must
be
married
thank
you
charlotte
what
next
do
you
suppose
i
going
to
be
married
in
that
shabby
old
straw
that
i
worn
all
the
spring
not
if
i
know
it
where
your
money
to
come
from
for
a
new
one
there
will
be
other
things
wanted
more
essential
than
a
bonnet
i
have
a
new
one
if
i
go
in
trust
for
it
returned
mary
ann
tyrrett
buys
the
ring
and
it
is
of
no
use
for
you
to
preach
charlotte
if
you
preach
your
tongue
out
it
do
no
good
charlotte
might
indeed
have
preached
a
very
long
sermon
before
she
could
effect
any
change
in
the
system
of
improvidence
obtaining
in
honey
fair
neither
benjamin
tyrrett
nor
mary
ann
cross
was
gifted
with
forethought
and
they
took
no
pains
to
acquire
it
the
marriage
was
carried
out
and
this
was
the
happy
day
cross
gave
an
entertainment
in
honour
of
the
event
at
which
the
bride
and
bridegroom
assisted
as
the
french
say
with
as
many
others
as
the
kitchen
would
hold
tea
for
the
ladies
pipes
and
ale
for
the
gentlemen
supper
for
all
with
handed
round
how
cross
had
contrived
to
go
on
so
long
without
an
she
scarcely
knew
herself
the
wonder
was
that
she
had
gone
on
at
all
it
took
the
energies
of
her
life
to
patch
up
her
embarrassments
and
hide
her
difficulties
from
her
husband
the
evil
day
however
was
only
delayed
it
could
not
be
averted
chapter
ix
an
explosion
for
cross
the
evil
day
hinted
at
in
the
last
chapter
was
not
long
in
coming
it
might
not
have
fallen
quite
so
soon
but
for
a
misfortune
which
overtook
jacob
cross
the
manufacturer
for
whom
he
worked
died
suddenly
and
the
business
was
immediately
given
up
the
made
gloves
being
bought
by
up
a
london
house
and
the
stock
in
trade
leather
machines
sold
by
auction
he
had
been
a
manufacturer
doing
nearly
as
large
a
business
as
ashley
and
not
only
jacob
cross
but
many
more
men
in
honey
fair
were
thrown
out
of
work
one
of
whom
was
andrew
brumm
another
timothy
carter
this
happened
only
a
few
months
after
mary
ann
cross
marriage
it
struck
terror
to
the
heart
of
cross
though
she
had
paid
some
of
her
debts
she
had
incurred
others
indeed
the
very
fact
of
her
having
to
pay
had
caused
her
to
incur
fresh
ones
her
position
was
ominous
she
and
amelia
had
worked
for
this
same
manufacturer
now
dead
and
of
course
they
were
at
a
standstill
mary
ann
tyrrett
had
likewise
worked
for
him
but
she
had
left
the
paternal
home
and
with
her
we
have
nothing
just
now
to
do
the
position
of
others
was
ominous
as
well
as
that
of
cross
it
was
the
autumn
season
and
trade
was
flat
winter
orders
had
gone
in
and
there
was
no
necessity
to
hurry
those
for
the
spring
so
that
the
hands
thrown
out
of
work
both
men
and
women
stood
every
chance
of
remaining
out
a
gloom
overspread
honey
fair
in
many
a
household
the

went
week
after
week
to
the
pawnbrokers
without
being
redeemed
on
the
saturday
night
as
in
more
prosperous
times
upon
the
proceeds
the
families
had
to
exist
it
was
bad
enough
for
those
who
were
free
from
debt
but
for
those
already
labouring
under
it
above
all
labouring
under
secret
debt
it
was
something
not
to
be
told
cross
had
nightmares
regularly
every
night
visions
would
come
over
her
now
and
again
of
running
away
if
she
had
only
known
where
to
run
to
the
men
would
stand
or
sit
at
their
doors
all
day
with
pipes
in
their
mouths
money
was
sure
to
be
found
for
tobacco
by
hook
or
by
crook
there
they
would
lounge
in
gloomy
silence
varied
by
an
occasional
wordy
war
with
their
wives
who
wished
them
anywhere
else
or
they
and
their
pipes
would
saunter
up
and
down
the
road
forming
into
groups
to
condole
with
each
other
and
to
abuse
the
glove
trade
one
monday
afternoon
there
was
a
small
assemblage
in
the
kitchen
of
jacob
cross
himself
andrew
brumm
and
timothy
carter
brumm
and
carter
were
in
one
sense
more
fortunate
than
cross
inasmuch
as
that
their
respective
wives
worked
each
for
another
house
not
the
one
which
had
closed
therefore
they
retained
their
employment
the
fact
however
appeared
to
afford
little
consolation
to
the
two
men
for
they
were
keeping
up
a
chorus
of
grumbling
when
joe
fisher
staggered
in
if
you
have
not
forgotten
him
fisher
had
hitherto
managed
to
the
intense
surprise
of
every
one
to
keep
out
of
the
workhouse
he
would
be
taken
on
for
a
job
of
work
now
and
then
but
manufacturers
were
chary
of
employing
joe
fisher
for
one
thing
he
gave
way
to
drink
a
object
had
he
become
a
tattered
coat
and
waistcoat
pantaloons
in
rags
and
not
the
ghost
of
a
shirt
people
wondered
how
he
found
money
for
drink
who
give
us
was
his
salutation
as
he
pushed
himself
in
his
eyes
haggard
his
legs
unsteady
his
face
thin
from
incipient
famine
will
nobody
give
us
a
corner
to
lie
in
the
men
took
their
pipes
from
their
mouths
turned
out
at
last
joe
turned
out
replied
joe
and
my
missis
close
upon
her
cross
who
was
at
the
back
of
the
kitchen
washing
out
her
potato
saucepan
of
which
frugal
edible
seasoned
with
salt
the
family
dinner
had
consisted
put
in
her
word
you
could
expect
nothing
else
joe
fisher
there
you
have
been
in
them
folks
furnished
room
paying
nothing
and
paying
nothing
and
you
drinking
everlasting
they
have
threatened
you
long
enough
last
week
you
know
they
took
a
vow
you
should
go
this
where
the
wife
and
little
asked
meek
timothy
carter
you
can
look
at
responded
fisher
they
not
a
hundred
miles
off
they
bai
out
of
view
he
gave
a
flourish
of
his
hand
towards
the
road
and
the
men
and
cross
crowded
to
the
door
to
reconnoitre
in
the
middle
of
the
lane
crouched
down
in
its
mud
for
the
weather
had
been
bad
and
it
was
very
wet
under
foot
was
untidy
sukey
fisher
a
woman
all
skin
and
bone
now
her
face
hopeless
and
desperate
she
wore
no
cap
and
her
matted
hair
fell
on
to
her
gown
such
a
gown
all
tatters
and
dirt
several
young
children
huddled
around
her
untidy
creature
muttered
cross
to
herself
she
is
as
fond
of
a
drop
as
her
lazy
quarrelsome
husband
and
this
is
what
they
have
brought
it
to
between
them
poor
little
objects
of
young
be
as
well
dead
as
alive
look
at
began
fisher
and
they
call
this
a
free
country
they
call
it
a
country
as
is
a
pattern
to
others
and
a
refuge
for
the
needy
why
do
government
that
opened
our
ports
to
them
foreign
french
and
keeps
open
come
down
and
take
a
look
at
my
wife
squatting
there
turned
out
of
our
room
without
a
place
to
put
our
heads
into
if
you
had
put
quite
as
much
inside
your
head
joe
fisher
and
been
doing
of
it
for
years
you
might
have
had
more
for
the
outside
now
again
spoke
cross
in
her
sharp
tones
the
woman
was
not
naturally
sharp
as
were
some
in
honey
fair
but
the
miserable
fear
she
lived
in
added
to
their
present
privations
told
upon
her
temper
hold
your
magging
said
joe
fisher
i
never
like
to
quarrel
with
petticuts
one
own
belongings
excepted
all
as
i
say
mother
cross
is
do
mag
cross
made
no
reply
to
this
and
fisher
resumed
this
comes
of
letting
the
government
and
the
masters
have
their
own
way
if
we
had
that
there
strike
among
us
that
i
so
often
told
ye
on
things
would
be
different
let
a
man
sit
down
a
minute
cross
cross
civilly
pushed
a
chair
towards
him
concentrating
his
attention
afterwards
upon
fisher
a
crowd
had
collected
round
her
and
buffle
with
a
feeling
of
humanity
that
few
had
given
that
lady
credit
for
possessing
sent
out
an
old
woollen
shawl
to
the
shivering
woman
and
a
basin
of
hasty
pudding
the
mother
could
not
feed
the
whining
children
fast
enough
with
the
one
iron
spoon
a
young
man
ran
up
to
cross
door
it
was
adam
thorneycroft
he
did
not
live
in
honey
fair
but
often
found
his
way
to
it
although
charlotte
had
rejected
him
is
joe
fisher
here
asked
he
fisher
why
do
you
go
to
the
workhouse
and
tell
them
the
state
your
wife
is
in
she
stop
there
her
state
is
no
concern
of
master
thorneycroft
was
the
sullen
answer
thorneycroft
turned
on
his
heel
a
scornful
gesture
escaping
him
at
fisher
condition
i
must
be
off
to
my
work
he
observed
but
ca
one
of
you
who
are
gentlemen
at
large
just
go
to
the
workhouse
and
acquaint
them
with
the
woman
helplessness
and
that
of
her
children
around
her
timothy
carter
responded
to
it
i
go
said
he
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
myself
this
afternoon
timothy
and
adam
walked
away
together
tim
treading
with
gingerly
feet
past
his
own
door
lest
his
wife
should
recognise
his
step
bolt
out
and
stop
him
charlotte
east
was
standing
at
her
door
and
adam
halted
timothy
walked
on
he
did
not
feel
himself
perfectly
safe
yet
what
a
life
that
poor
woman
is
exclaimed
charlotte
ay
assented
adam
and
all
through
fisher
not
sticking
to
his
work
charlotte
moved
her
face
gravely
towards
him
say
through
his
drinking
adam
do
you
speak
that
as
a
warning
charlotte
he
continued
i
think
you
mean
well
by
me
but
you
go
just
the
wrong
way
to
show
it
if
you
wanted
me
to
keep
steady
you
should
have
come
and
helped
me
in
it
i
am
late
gentlemen
at
large
young
thorney
called
us
cried
jacob
cross
to
his
friend
brumm
as
fisher
went
off
and
they
sat
down
again
he
not
far
out
what
to
be
the
end
o
why
the
responded
cross
who
rarely
let
an
opportunity
slip
of
putting
in
her
own
opinion
the
for
us
as
well
as
for
the
fishers
unless
things
take
a
turn
when
great
big
men
is
throwed
out
o
work
and
yet
has
to
eat
and
drink
and
other
folks
at
home
has
to
eat
and
drink
and
nothing
to
stay
their
stomachs
upon
the
ca
be
far
off
never
for
me
said
andrew
brumm
i
work
to
keep
me
and
mine
out
on
it
if
it
is
at
breaking
stones
upon
the
road
i
know
one
thing
if
ever
i
do
get
into
certain
work
again
i
make
my
missis
be
a
bit
providenter
than
she
was
before
bell
brumm
ai
one
of
the
provident
sort
dissented
cross
how
do
you
manage
to
get
along
at
all
drew
these
bad
times
you
do
seem
to
get
into
trouble
well
we
manage
somehow
replied
andrew
but
we
have
to
pinch
my
missis
sticks
at
her
work
now
i
be
out
o
she
hardly
looks
off
it
and
i
does
the
house
and
sees
to
the
children
nine
shilling
all
but
her
silk
she
earned
last
week
and
finding
that
we
exist
on
that
after
a
fashion
has
set
me
thinking
that
when
my
good
wages
was
added
to
it
we
ought
to
have
put
by
for
a
rainy
day
he
continued
after
a
pause
just
let
me
get
the
chance
again
it
surprising
the
miracles
wages
works
when
folks
ai
earning
none
put
in
cross
in
a
tone
of
irony
who
did
not
altogether
like
the
turn
the
conversation
was
taking
when
you
get
into
work
again
drew
brumm
your
wife
wo
be
more
able
to
save
than
the
rest
of
us
but
she
shall
returned
andrew
and
she
sees
for
herself
now
that
it
might
be
done
i
was
a
calkelation
yesterday
how
long
we
might
hold
out
on
our
household
things
observed
jacob
cross
a
silent
man
in
general
if
none
of
us
can
get
work
they
have
to
go
piecemeal
one
clam
one
must
live
upon
something
i
resolved
upon
one
point
that
i
wo
have
no
underhand
debt
again
resumed
brumm
last
spring
i
found
out
the
flaring
trade
my
missis
was
carrying
on
with
them
bankes
and
the
way
i
come
to
know
of
it
was
funny
but
never
mind
that
says
i
to
her
rather
sell
off
all
i
got
and
go
tramping
the
country
than
i
live
with
a
sword
over
my
head
which
debt
is
and
i
went
down
to
bankes
and
said
to
you
let
my
wife
get
into
debt
again
i
wo
pay
it
as
i
now
give
you
notice
and
i
have
you
up
before
the
justices
for
a
pest
i
thought
i
make
it
strong
you
see
cross
and
i
paid
off
their
bill
so
much
a
week
and
got
shut
of
them
bankes
does
more
mischief
in
honey
fair
than
everything
else
put
together
why
what
do
bankes
do
asked
jacob
in
happy
ignorance
do
returned
brumm
do
you
know
but
at
that
critical
moment
cross
in
bustling
behind
andrew
brumm
chair
which
was
on
the
tilt
contrived
to
get
her
foot
entangled
in
it
brumm
his
chair
and
his
pipe
all
came
down
together
mercy
on
us
uttered
jacob
cross
coming
to
the
rescue
how
did
you
manage
that
brumm
before
brumm
could
answer
or
had
well
gathered
himself
up
there
was
another
visitor
abbott
the
landlord
of
at
least
a
third
of
honey
fair
he
had
come
on
his
usual
monday
errand
jacob
cross
put
down
his
pipe
and
touched
his
hat
which
in
the
manners
of
honey
fair
was
worn
indoors
it
was
not
often
that
the
landlord
and
the
men
came
into
contact
with
each
other
are
you
ready
for
me
mrs
cross
we
are
not
ready
sir
interposed
jacob
you
must
please
to
give
us
a
little
grace
these
hard
times
sir
the
moment
i
be
in
work
again
i
think
of
you
before
i
think
of
ourselves
i
have
given
all
the
grace
i
can
give
replied
abbott
a
hard
surly
man
you
must
either
pay
or
turn
out
i
do
care
which
i
pay
you
as
soon
as
i
am
in
work
sir
you
may
count
upon
it
as
to
turning
out
sir
where
could
i
turn
to
you
not
let
me
take
out
my
furniture
and
we
ca
sit
down
in
the
street
as
fisher
wife
is
doing
abbott
turned
to
the
door
when
he
came
back
a
man
was
with
him
i
must
trouble
you
to
give
this
man
for
a
few
days
as
you
wo
go
out
he
must
stop
in
to
see
that
your
goods
stop
in
cross
spirit
rose
within
him
it
a
hard
way
to
treat
a
man
sir
i
have
lived
under
you
for
years
and
you
have
had
your
rent
regular
regular
exclaimed
the
landlord
i
have
had
more
trouble
to
get
it
from
your
wife
since
bankes
came
to
helstonleigh
than
from
anybody
else
in
honey
fair
cross
did
not
understand
this
he
was
too
much
absorbed
by
the
point
in
question
to
ask
an
explanation
there
only
three
weeks
owing
to
you
sir
and
three
weeks
interrupted
abbott
there
are
nine
weeks
owing
to
me
nine
weeks
jacob
cross
stood
confounded
who
says
there
nine
weeks
asked
he
i
say
so
your
wife
can
say
so
ask
her
but
cross
with
a
scared
face
and
white
lips
whisked
through
the
door
and
hurried
down
honey
fair
the
explosion
had
come
abbott
wasting
no
more
words
departed
leaving
the
unwelcome
visitor
behind
him
andrew
brumm
came
in
again
from
outside
where
he
had
stood
out
of
delicacy
feeling
thankful
that
rent
was
all
right
it
was
pinching
work
but
andrew
was
beginning
to
learn
that
debt
pinches
the
mind
more
than
hunger
pinches
the
body
comrade
whispered
he
grasping
cross
hand
it
all
along
of
them
bankes
the
women
buy
their
and
their
finery
and
the
weekly
payments
to
must
be
kept
up
whether
or
no
for
fear
bankes
should
let
out
o
to
us
and
ask
us
for
the
money
of
course
the
rent
and
other
things
gets
behind
half
the
women
round
us
are
in
bankes
books
why
could
you
have
told
me
this
before
demanded
cross
in
his
astonishment
it
not
my
province
to
interfere
with
other
men
wives
was
sensible
answer
where
she
got
to
cried
jacob
looking
round
for
his
wife
come
to
the
bottom
of
this
nine
weeks
rent
owing
and
her
salving
me
up
that
it
was
only
three
jacob
might
well
say
where
she
got
to
cross
had
glided
down
honey
fair
into
the
first
friendly
door
that
happened
to
be
open
that
was
carter
for
mercy
sake
let
stop
here
a
minute
elizabeth
carter
exclaimed
she
we
have
got
the
bums
in
carter
was
rubbing
up
some
brass
candlesticks
work
ran
short
with
her
that
week
and
therefore
she
spent
it
in
cleaning
which
was
her
notion
of
taking
holiday
scrubbing
and
scouring
from
morning
till
night
she
turned
round
and
stared
at
cross
who
with
white
face
and
gasping
breath
had
sunk
down
upon
a
chair
what
on
earth
the
matter
abbott
has
brought
it
out
to
my
husband
that
i
owes
nine
weeks
rent
and
he
telling
him
about
bankes
and
now
he
has
gone
and
put
a
bum
into
the
house
more
soft
you
to
have
had
to
do
with
bankes
was
the
sympathy
offered
by
carter
you
could
expect
nothing
less
that
old
skinflint
abbott
cross
stopped
short
she
opened
the
staircase
door
about
an
inch
and
humbly
twisted
herself
through
the
aperture
who
should
be
standing
there
to
hear
her
having
followed
her
in
but
abbott
himself
he
had
no
need
to
say
ready
mrs
carter
carter
always
was
ready
she
paid
him
weekly
and
asked
no
favour
the
payment
made
he
departed
again
and
cross
emerged
from
her
retreat
can
pay
him
she
exclaimed
with
some
envy
and
timothy
out
o
work
too
and
you
be
slack
how
do
you
manage
it
i
not
a
fool
was
the
logical
response
of
carter
if
i
spent
my
earnings
when
they
are
coming
in
regular
or
let
tim
keep
his
to
his
own
cheek
where
should
we
be
in
a
time
like
this
i
have
my
understanding
about
me
carter
did
not
praise
her
understanding
without
cause
whatever
social
virtues
she
may
have
lacked
she
was
rich
in
thrift
in
forethought
had
timothy
remained
out
of
work
for
a
twelvemonth
they
would
not
have
been
put
to
shifts
i
afraid
to
go
back
cried
cross
so
should
i
be
if
i
got
myself
into
your
mess
the
offered
sympathy
not
being
consolatory
to
her
present
frame
of
mind
cross
departed
home
at
present
she
dared
not
go
she
went
about
honey
fair
seeking
the
gossiping
pity
which
elizabeth
carter
had
declined
to
give
but
which
she
was
yearning
for
thus
she
spent
an
hour
or
two
meanwhile
the
news
had
been
spreading
through
honey
fair
crosses
had
the
bums
in
and
mary
ann
hearing
it
flew
home
to
know
whether
it
was
correct
she
partly
through
fear
partly
in
the
security
from
paternal
correction
imparted
to
her
by
the
feeling
that
she
was
mary
ann
tyrrett
and
no
longer
mary
ann
cross
yielded
to
her
questions
and
made
full
confession
debts
here
debts
there
debts
everywhere
cross
was
overwhelmed
and
when
his
wife
at
length
came
in
he
quietly
knocked
her
down
the
broker
advanced
to
the
rescue
if
you
dare
to
come
between
man
and
wife
raved
cross
lifting
his
arm
menacingly
i
serve
you
the
same
he
was
a
man
but
this
business
had
terribly
exasperated
him
you
come
to
die
in
the
he
uttered
to
his
wife
and
serve
you
right
it
your
doings
that
have
broke
up
our
home
no
retorted
she
passionately
as
she
lifted
herself
from
the
floor
it
your
squanderings
in
the
publics
o
nights
that
have
helped
to
break
up
our
home
it
was
a
little
of
both
the
quarrel
was
interrupted
by
a
commotion
outside
and
cross
darted
out
to
look
glad
perhaps
to
escape
from
her
husband
anger
an
official
from
the
workhouse
had
come
down
with
an
order
for
the
admission
of
susan
fisher
instanter
timothy
carter
in
his
meek
and
humane
spirit
had
so
enlarged
upon
the
state
of
affairs
in
general
touching
fisher
that
the
workhouse
bestirred
itself
an
officer
was
despatched
to
marshal
them
into
it
at
once
the
uproar
was
caused
by
her
resistance
she
was
still
sitting
in
the
road
i
wo
go
into
the
she
screamed
i
wo
go
there
to
be
parted
from
my
children
and
my
husband
if
i
to
die
i
die
out
here
just
get
up
and
march
and
do
let
have
no
row
said
the
officer
else
i
fetch
a
and
wheel
ye
to
it
she
resisted
shrieking
and
flinging
her
arms
and
her
wild
hair
about
her
as
only
a
foolish
woman
would
do
the
children
alarmed
clung
to
her
and
cried
and
all
honey
fair
came
out
to
look
joe
fisher
also
staggered
up
in
a
state
not
to
be
described
he
had
been
invited
by
some
friend
more
sympathizing
than
judicious
to
solace
his
troubles
with
strong
waters
and
down
he
fell
in
the
mud
helpless
well
here
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
cried
the
perplexed
workhouse
man
a
nice
pair
they
are
how
i
am
to
get
both
there
is
beyond
me
she
can
walk
if
she
forced
to
it
but
he
ca
they
spend
their
money
in
sotting
and
when
they
have
no
more
to
spend
they
come
to
us
to
keep
i
must
get
an
open
cart
the
cart
was
procured
somewhere
and
brought
to
the
scene
a
policeman
in
attendance
and
the
children
were
lifted
into
it
one
by
one
next
the
man
was
thrown
in
like
a
clod
and
then
came
the
woman
turn
with
much
struggling
and
kicking
with
shrieks
that
might
have
been
heard
a
mile
off
she
was
at
length
hoisted
into
it
but
she
tumbled
out
again
raving
that
no
should
hold
her
the
official
raved
in
turn
and
honey
fair
hugged
itself
it
had
not
had
the
gratification
of
so
exciting
a
scene
for
many
a
day
to
say
nothing
of
the
satisfaction
it
derived
from
hearing
the
workhouse
set
at
defiance
the
official
and
the
policeman
at
length
conquered
she
was
secured
and
the
cart
started
at
a
snail
pace
with
its
load
fisher
setting
up
a
prolonged
and
dismal
lamentation
not
unlike
an
irish
howl
and
honey
fair
in
its
curiosity
following
the
cart
as
its
train
chapter
x
a
stray
shilling
whose
shilling
is
this
on
my
desk
inquired
ashley
of
samuel
lynn
one
morning
towards
the
close
of
the
summer
i
can
not
tell
thee
was
the
reply
of
the
quaker
i
know
nothing
of
it
it
is
none
of
mine
to
my
knowledge
remarked
ashley
what
shilling
is
that
on
the
master
desk
repeated
samuel
lynn
to
william
when
he
returned
into
his
own
room
where
william
was
i
put
a
shilling
on
the
desk
this
morning
replied
william
i
found
it
in
the
basket
thee
go
in
then
and
tell
the
master
william
did
so
the
shilling
rolled
out
of
the
basket
sir
said
he
entering
the
and
approaching
ashley
ashley
was
remarkably
exact
in
his
accounts
he
had
missed
no
shilling
and
he
did
not
think
it
was
his
what
should
bring
a
shilling
in
the
basket
he
asked
it
may
have
rolled
out
of
your
own
pocket
william
could
have
smiled
at
the
remark
a
shilling
out
of
pocket
oh
no
sir
it
did
not
ashley
sat
looking
earnestly
at
william
as
the
latter
fancied
in
reality
he
was
buried
deep
in
his
own
thoughts
but
william
felt
uncomfortable
under
the
survey
and
his
face
flushed
to
a
glow
why
should
he
feel
uncomfortable
what
should
cause
the
flush
this
since
janey
death
some
months
ago
now
their
circumstances
had
been
more
straitened
than
ever
of
course
there
had
been
expenses
attending
it
and
halliburton
was
paying
them
off
weekly
bread
and
potatoes
and
a
little
milk
would
often
be
their
food
on
the
previous
night
jane
had
a
sick
headache
some
tea
would
have
been
acceptable
but
she
had
neither
tea
nor
money
in
the
house
and
she
was
firm
in
her
resolution
not
to
purchase
on
trust
on
this
morning
early
when
william
rose
he
found
his
mother
down
before
him
at
her
work
as
usual
her
head
felt
better
she
said
it
might
get
quite
well
if
she
had
only
some
tea
but
she
had
not
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
william
went
out
ardently
wishing
in
the
vague
profitless
manner
that
he
might
have
wished
for
aladdin
lamp
that
he
had
only
a
shilling
to
procure
some
for
her
when
half
an
hour
after
this
shilling
rolled
out
of
the
basket
as
he
was
shaking
it
in
ashley
a
strong
temptation
not
to
take
it
but
to
wish
that
he
might
take
it
that
it
was
not
wrong
to
take
it
rushed
over
him
he
put
it
down
on
the
desk
and
turned
from
it
turned
from
the
temptation
for
the
shilling
seemed
to
scorch
his
fingers
the
remembrance
of
this
wish
it
sounded
to
him
like
a
dishonest
one
had
brought
the
vivid
colour
to
his
face
under
what
he
thought
was
ashley
scrutiny
that
gentleman
observed
it
what
are
you
turning
red
for
this
crowned
all
william
face
changed
to
scarlet
ashley
was
surprised
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
some
mystery
must
be
connected
with
the
shilling
something
wrong
he
determined
to
fathom
it
why
do
you
look
confused
he
resumed
it
was
only
at
my
own
thoughts
sir
what
are
they
let
me
hear
them
william
hesitated
i
would
rather
not
tell
them
sir
but
i
would
rather
you
did
ashley
spoke
quietly
as
usual
but
there
lay
command
in
the
quietest
tone
of
ashley
implicit
obedience
had
been
enjoined
upon
the
halliburtons
from
their
earliest
childhood
in
that
manufactory
ashley
was
and
he
believed
he
had
no
resource
but
to
comply
with
his
desire
william
was
of
a
remarkably
ingenuous
nature
and
if
he
had
to
impart
a
thing
he
did
not
do
it
by
halves
although
it
might
tell
against
himself
when
i
found
that
shilling
this
morning
sir
the
thought
came
over
me
to
wish
it
was
mine
to
wish
that
i
might
take
it
without
doing
ill
the
thought
did
not
come
over
me
take
he
added
raising
his
truthful
eyes
to
ashley
only
to
wish
that
it
was
not
wrong
to
do
so
when
you
looked
at
me
so
earnestly
sir
i
fancied
you
could
see
what
my
thoughts
had
been
and
they
were
not
honourable
thoughts
did
you
ever
take
money
that
was
not
yours
asked
ashley
after
a
pause
william
looked
surprised
no
sir
never
ashley
paused
again
i
have
known
children
help
themselves
to
halfpence
and
pence
and
think
it
little
crime
the
boy
shook
his
head
we
have
been
taught
better
than
that
sir
and
besides
the
crime
money
taken
in
that
way
would
bring
us
no
good
only
trouble
it
could
not
prosper
tell
me
why
you
think
that
my
mother
has
always
taught
us
that
a
bad
action
can
never
prosper
in
the
end
i
suppose
you
coveted
the
shilling
for
marbles
or
for
sweetmeats
oh
no
sir
it
was
not
for
myself
that
i
wished
it
then
for
whom
for
what
this
caused
william
face
to
flush
again
ashley
questioned
till
he
drew
from
him
the
particulars
how
that
he
had
wished
to
buy
some
tea
and
why
he
had
wished
it
i
have
heard
remarked
ashley
after
listening
that
you
have
many
privations
to
put
up
with
it
is
true
sir
but
we
do
so
much
care
for
them
if
we
only
put
up
with
them
my
mother
says
she
knows
better
days
will
be
in
store
for
us
if
we
only
bear
on
patiently
i
am
sure
we
boys
ought
to
do
so
if
she
can
it
is
worse
for
her
than
for
us
there
ensued
another
searching
question
from
ashley
have
you
ever
when
alone
in
the
amidst
its
thousands
of
eggs
been
tempted
to
pocket
a
few
to
carry
home
for
one
moment
william
suffered
a
flash
of
resentment
to
cross
his
countenance
the
next
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
felt
deeply
hurt
no
sir
i
have
not
i
hope
you
do
not
fear
that
i
am
capable
of
it
no
i
do
not
said
ashley
your
father
was
a
clergyman
i
think
i
have
heard
he
was
intended
for
a
clergyman
sir
but
he
did
not
get
to
the
university
his
father
was
a
clergyman
a
rector
in
devonshire
and
my
mother
father
was
a
clergyman
in
london
my
uncle
francis
is
also
a
clergyman
but
only
a
curate
we
are
gentlepeople
though
we
are
poor
we
would
not
take
eggs
or
anything
else
ashley
suppressed
a
smile
i
conclude
that
you
and
your
brothers
live
in
hope
some
time
of
regaining
your
position
in
life
yes
sir
i
think
it
is
that
hope
that
makes
us
put
up
with
hard
things
so
well
what
do
you
think
of
being
william
countenance
fell
there
is
not
so
much
chance
of
my
getting
on
sir
as
there
is
for
my
brothers
frank
and
gar
are
hopeful
enough
but
i
do
look
forward
to
anything
good
for
me
my
mother
says
if
i
only
help
her
i
shall
be
doing
my
duty
your
sister
died
in
a
decline
remarked
ashley
these
home
privations
must
have
told
upon
her
william
face
brightened
she
had
everything
she
wanted
sir
everything
even
to
port
wine
reece
and
dobbs
took
a
liking
to
her
when
they
first
came
and
they
never
let
her
want
for
anything
mamma
says
that
jane
wants
having
been
supplied
in
so
extraordinary
a
manner
ought
to
teach
us
how
certainly
god
is
looking
over
us
and
taking
care
of
us
that
all
things
when
they
come
to
be
absolutely
needed
will
no
doubt
be
supplied
to
us
as
they
were
to
her
what
a
perfect
trust
in
god
that
boy
seems
to
have
mused
ashley
when
he
dismissed
william
halliburton
must
be
a
mother
in
a
thousand
and
he
will
make
a
man
in
a
thousand
unless
i
am
mistaken
truthful
open
candid
do
know
a
boy
like
him
about
five
minutes
before
the
great
bell
was
rung
at
one
william
was
called
into
the
i
have
been
casting
up
my
cash
and
find
i
am
a
shilling
short
observed
ashley
therefore
the
shilling
that
you
found
is
no
doubt
the
missing
one
i
shall
give
it
to
you
he
continued
a
reward
for
telling
me
the
straightforward
truth
when
i
questioned
you
william
took
the
shilling
as
he
supposed
here
are
two
he
exclaimed
in
his
surprise
you
can
not
buy
much
tea
with
one
and
that
is
what
you
were
thinking
of
would
you
like
to
be
apprenticed
to
me
ashley
resumed
drowning
the
boy
thanks
the
question
took
william
by
storm
he
was
at
a
loss
what
to
answer
he
would
have
been
equally
at
a
loss
had
he
been
accorded
a
whole
week
to
deliberate
upon
it
he
looked
foolish
and
said
he
could
not
tell
would
you
like
the
business
pursued
ashley
i
like
the
business
very
well
sir
now
i
used
to
it
but
i
could
not
hope
ever
to
get
on
to
be
a
master
there
no
knowing
what
you
may
get
on
to
be
if
you
are
steady
and
persevering
masters
do
begin
at
the
top
of
the
tree
they
begin
at
the
bottom
and
work
up
to
it
at
least
that
is
the
case
with
a
great
many
in
becoming
an
apprentice
you
would
occupy
a
better
position
in
the
manufactory
than
you
do
now
joe
stubbs
is
an
apprentice
is
he
not
sir
i
will
explain
it
to
you
if
you
do
not
understand
said
ashley
joe
stubbs
is
apprenticed
to
one
branch
of
the
business
the
cutting
john
braithwait
is
an
apprentice
to
the
staining
and
so
on
these
lads
expect
to
remain
workmen
all
their
lives
working
at
their
own
peculiar
branch
you
would
not
be
apprenticed
to
any
one
branch
but
to
the
whole
with
a
view
to
becoming
hereafter
a
manager
or
a
master
in
the
same
manner
that
i
might
apprentice
my
son
were
he
intended
for
the
business
william
thought
he
should
like
this
suddenly
his
countenance
fell
what
now
asked
ashley
i
have
heard
sir
that
the
apprentices
do
not
earn
wages
at
first
i
i
am
afraid
we
could
not
well
do
at
home
without
mine
you
need
not
concern
yourself
with
what
you
hear
or
with
what
others
earn
or
do
earn
i
should
give
you
eight
shillings
instead
of
four
and
you
would
retain
your
evenings
for
study
as
you
do
now
i
do
not
see
any
different
or
better
opening
for
you
continued
ashley
but
should
any
arise
hereafter
through
your
mother
relatives
or
from
any
other
channel
i
would
not
stand
in
the
way
of
your
advancement
but
would
consent
to
cancel
your
indentures
do
you
understand
what
i
have
been
saying
yes
sir
i
do
thank
you
very
much
you
can
speak
to
halliburton
about
it
and
hear
what
her
wishes
may
be
concluded
ashley
the
result
was
that
william
was
apprenticed
to
ashley
i
can
tell
thee
thee
hast
found
favour
with
the
master
remarked
samuel
lynn
to
william
he
has
made
thee
his
apprentice
and
has
admitted
thee
i
hear
to
the
companionship
of
his
son
they
are
proofs
that
he
judges
well
of
thee
pay
thee
attention
to
deserve
it
it
was
quite
true
that
william
was
admitted
to
the
occasional
companionship
of
henry
ashley
henry
had
taken
a
fancy
to
him
and
would
get
him
there
to
help
him
stumble
through
his
latin
the
next
to
be
apprenticed
to
ashley
and
almost
at
the
same
time
was
cyril
dare
but
when
he
found
that
he
was
to
be
the
of
william
halliburton
the
two
on
a
level
in
every
respect
wages
excepted
and
of
wages
master
cyril
was
at
first
to
earn
none
he
was
most
indignant
and
complained
explosively
to
his
father
ca
you
speak
to
ashley
sir
where
would
be
the
use
asked
dare
there
not
a
man
in
helstonleigh
would
brook
interference
in
his
affairs
less
than
thomas
ashley
if
one
of
the
two
apprentices
must
leave
because
they
are
too
much
for
each
other
company
it
would
be
you
cyril
rely
upon
it
cyril
growled
but
as
dare
said
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
he
and
william
had
to
get
on
together
in
the
best
way
they
could
cyril
had
thought
that
he
should
be
the
only
at
ashley
there
was
a
marked
distinction
observed
in
a
manufactory
between
the
common
apprentices
who
did
the
rough
work
and
what
were
called
the
it
did
not
please
cyril
that
william
should
have
been
made
one
of
the
latter
chapter
xi
the
schoolboys
notes
as
the
time
went
on
jane
brain
grew
very
busy
its
care
was
the
education
of
her
boys
a
perplexing
theme
so
far
as
the
classics
went
they
were
progressing
frank
and
gar
certainly
were
not
pushed
on
as
they
might
have
been
for
helstonleigh
collegiate
school
was
not
at
that
time
renowned
for
its
pushing
qualities
but
the
boys
had
a
spur
in
themselves
jane
never
ceased
to
urge
them
to
attention
to
strive
after
progress
not
by
the
harsh
reproaches
some
children
have
to
hear
but
by
loving
encouragement
and
gentle
persuasion
she
would
call
up
pleasant
pictures
of
the
future
when
they
should
have
surmounted
the
difficulties
of
toil
and
be
reaping
their
reward
it
had
ever
been
her
custom
to
treat
her
children
as
friends
as
friends
and
companions
more
than
as
children
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
not
a
good
plan
in
all
cases
but
it
undoubtedly
is
so
where
children
are
naturally
well
disposed
and
intelligent
even
when
they
were
little
she
would
converse
and
reason
with
them
so
far
as
their
understandings
would
permit
the
primary
thing
she
inculcated
was
the
habit
of
unquestioning
obedience
this
secured
in
their
earliest
childhood
she
could
afford
to
reason
with
them
as
they
grew
older
to
appeal
to
their
own
sense
of
intelligence
to
show
them
how
to
form
and
exercise
a
right
judgment
had
the
children
been
wilful
deceitful
or
opposed
to
her
her
plan
must
have
been
different
compulsion
must
have
taken
the
place
of
reasoning
when
they
did
anything
wrong
all
children
will
or
they
are
not
children
she
would
take
the
offender
to
her
alone
there
would
be
no
scolding
but
in
a
grave
calm
loving
voice
she
would
say
was
this
right
did
you
forget
that
you
were
doing
wrong
and
would
grieve
me
did
you
forget
that
you
were
offending
god
and
so
she
would
talk
and
teach
them
to
do
right
in
all
things
for
the
sake
of
right
for
the
sake
of
doing
their
duty
to
heaven
and
to
man
these
lessons
from
a
mother
loved
as
jane
was
could
not
fail
to
take
root
and
bear
seed
the
young
halliburtons
were
in
fair
training
to
make
not
only
good
but
admirable
men
jane
inculcated
another
valuable
lesson
in
all
perplexity
trouble
or
untoward
misfortune
she
taught
them
to
it
full
in
the
not
to
fly
from
it
as
is
the
custom
but
to
meet
it
and
do
the
best
with
it
she
knew
that
in
trouble
as
in
terror
looking
it
in
the
face
takes
away
half
its
sting
and
so
she
was
teaching
them
to
look
not
only
by
precept
but
by
example
with
such
minds
such
training
to
work
upon
there
was
little
need
to
them
to
apply
closely
to
their
studies
they
saw
its
necessity
themselves
and
acted
upon
it
it
is
your
only
chance
my
darlings
of
getting
on
in
life
she
would
say
you
wish
to
be
good
and
great
men
and
i
think
perhaps
you
may
be
if
you
persevere
it
is
a
tempting
thing
i
know
to
leave
wearying
tasks
for
play
or
idleness
but
do
not
yield
to
it
look
to
the
future
when
you
feel
tired
out
of
sorts
as
if
latin
were
the
greatest
grievance
upon
earth
say
to
yourselves
is
my
duty
to
keep
on
and
my
duty
i
must
do
if
i
turn
idle
now
my
past
application
will
be
lost
but
if
i
persevere
i
may
go
bravely
on
to
the
end
be
brave
darlings
for
my
sake
and
the
boys
were
so
thus
it
would
happen
that
when
the
rest
of
the
school
were
talking
or
idling
or
being
caned
the
halliburtons
were
at
work
the
head
master
could
not
fail
to
observe
their
steady
application
and
he
more
than
once
held
them
up
as
an
example
to
the
school
so
far
so
good
but
though
the
classics
are
essential
parts
of
a
good
education
they
do
not
include
all
its
requisites
and
nothing
else
was
taught
in
the
college
school
there
certainly
was
a
writing
master
and
something
like
an
initiation
into
the
first
rules
of
arithmetic
was
attempted
but
not
a
boy
in
the
charity
school
hard
by
that
could
not
have
shamed
the
college
boys
in
adding
up
a
column
of
figures
or
in
writing
a
page
as
to
their
english
you
should
have
seen
them
attempt
to
write
a
letter
in
short
the
college
school
ignored
everything
except
latin
and
greek
this
state
of
affairs
gave
jane
great
concern
unless
i
can
organize
some
plan
my
boys
will
grow
up
dunces
she
said
to
herself
and
a
plan
she
did
organize
none
could
remedy
this
so
well
as
herself
she
so
thoroughly
educated
in
all
essential
branches
it
would
take
two
hours
from
her
work
but
for
the
sake
of
her
boys
she
would
sacrifice
that
every
night
therefore
except
saturday
as
soon
as
they
had
prepared
their
lessons
for
school
and
in
doing
that
they
were
helped
by
william
she
left
her
work
and
became
their
instructor
history
geography
astronomy
composition
and
so
on
you
can
fill
up
the
list
and
she
had
her
reward
the
boys
advanced
rapidly
as
the
months
and
quarters
went
on
it
was
only
so
much
the
more
instruction
gained
by
them
i
think
you
must
be
indulged
with
a
glance
at
one
of
these
college
school
notes
but
first
of
all
suppose
we
read
one
written
by
frank

glanced
over
the
boy
shoulder
he
glenn
was
a
surgeon
one
of
the
chief
surgeons

the
helstonleigh
infirmary

a
pretty
specimen
of
english
he
added
running
his
amused
eyes
over

philip
but

papa

glenn
but

your
friend
halliburton

turn
out
good
english
he
had
taken
up
frank
letter
oh
they
are
such
chaps
for
learning
the
two
halliburtons
they
stick
at
it
like
a
never
getting
the
cane
for
turned
lessons
they
have
school
at
home
in
the
evenings
for
english
and
history
and
such
stuff
that
they
do
get
at
college
have
they
a
tutor
they
are
not
rich
enough
for
a
tutor
halliburton
the
tutor
what
do
you
think
gar
halliburton
did
the
other
day
keating
was
having
a
row
with
the
fourth
desk
and
he
gave
them
some
extra
verses
to
do
up
goes
gar
halliburton
before
he
had
been
a
minute
at
his
seat
you
please
sir
says
he
to
keating
had
better
have
another
piece
so
asks
keating
says
gar
did
these
same
verses
with
my
brother
at
home
a
week
ago
he
meant
his
eldest
brother
not
frank
but
now
was
not
that
honourable
papa
yes
it
was
answered
glenn
that
just
the
halliburtons
all
over
they
are
i
should
like
to
see
your
friend
frank
and
inquire
how
he
manages
to
pick
up
his
english
let
me
bring
him
to
tea
night
cried
philip
eagerly
you
may
if
you
like
hurrah
shouted
philip
and
you
persuade
him
not
to
mind
his
mother
but
to
come
to
our
fishing
party
philip
well
papa
i
do
mean
that
exactly
but
i
do
not
see
the
use
of
boys
listening
to
their
mothers
just
in
everything
philip
glenn
seized
his
note
and
added
a
postscript
my
father
sais
you
are
to
come
to
tea
we
shall
be
so
joly
and
it
was
despatched
to
frank
by
a
servant
in
livery
chapter
xii
a
lesson
for
philip
glenn
frank
was
as
eager
to
accept
the
invitation
as
philip
had
been
to
offer
it
when
the
afternoon
arrived
and
school
was
over
frank
tore
home
donned
his
best
clothes
and
then
tore
back
again
to
glenn
house
philip
received
him
in
the
small
room
where
he
and
his
brother
prepared
their
lessons
how
is
it
that
you
and
my
boys
write
english
so
differently
inquired
glenn
when
he
had
made
frank
acquaintance
frank
broke
into
a
broad
smile
suggested
by
the
remembrance
of
english
we
study
it
at
home
sir
but
some
one
teaches
you
mamma
she
was
afraid
that
we
should
grow
up
ignorant
of
everything
except
latin
and
greek
so
she
thought
she
would
remedy
the
evil
and
she
takes
you
in
an
evening
yes
sir
every
evening
except
saturday
when
she
is
sure
to
be
busy
she
comes
to
the
table
as
soon
as
our
lessons
for
school
are
prepared
and
we
commence
english
the
easier
portions
of
our
latin
and
greek
we
do
in
the
day
i
and
gar
we
crib
the
time
from
and
my
brother
william
helps
us
at
night
with
the
more
difficult
parts
where
is
your
brother
at
school
asked
glenn
he
is
not
at
school
sir
he
is
at
ashley
with
cyril
dare
william
has
not
been
to
school
since
papa
died
but
he
was
well
up
in
everything
for
papa
had
taken
great
pains
with
him
and
he
has
gone
on
by
himself
since
can
he
do
much
good
by
himself
good
echoed
frank
speaking
bluntly
in
his
eagerness
i
do
think
you
could
find
so
good
a
scholar
for
his
age
there
not
one
could
come
near
him
in
the
college
school
at
first
he
found
it
hard
work
he
had
no
one
to
explain
difficult
points
for
him
and
was
obliged
to
puzzle
them
out
with
his
own
brains
and
it
that
that
has
got
him
on
glenn
nodded
where
a
good
foundation
has
been
laid
a
boy
may
get
on
better
without
a
master
than
with
one
provided
that
is
just
what
william
says
interrupted
frank
his
dark
eyes
sparkling
with
animation
he
would
have
given
anything
at
one
time
to
be
at
the
college
school
with
us
but
he
does
not
care
about
it
now
provided
his
heart
is
in
his
work
i
was
about
to
add
said
glenn
smiling
at
frank
eagerness
oh
of
course
sir
and
that
what
william
is
he
has
such
capital
books
too
all
the
best
that
are
published
they
were
papa
i
hardly
know
how
i
and
gar
should
get
on
without
william
help
does
he
help
you
he
has
helped
us
ever
since
papa
died
before
we
went
to
college
and
since
we
do
algebra
and
euclid
with
him
in
deed
exclaimed
glenn
looking
hard
at
frank
when
do
you
contrive
to
do
all
this
in
the
evening
tea
is
over
by
five
and
we
three
william
i
and
gar
turn
at
once
to
our
lessons
in
about
two
hours
mamma
joins
us
and
we
work
with
her
about
two
hours
more
of
course
we
have
different
nights
for
different
studies
latin
every
night
greek
nearly
every
night
euclid
twice
a
week
algebra
twice
a
week
and
so
on
and
the
lessons
we
do
with
mamma
are
portioned
out
some
one
night
some
another
you
must
be
very
persevering
boys
cried
glenn
do
you
never
catch
yourselves
looking
off
to
play
to
talk
and
laugh
no
sir
never
we
have
got
into
the
habit
of
sticking
to
our
lessons
mamma
brought
us
into
it
and
then
we
are
anxious
to
get
on
half
the
battle
lies
in
that
i
think
it
does
philip
my
boy
here
a
lesson
for
you
and
for
all
other
lazy
scapegraces
philip
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
laugh
papa
i
do
see
any
good
in
working
so
hard
your
friend
frank
does
we
are
obliged
to
work
sir
said
frank
candidly
we
have
no
money
and
it
is
only
by
education
that
we
can
hope
to
get
on
mamma
thinks
it
may
turn
out
all
for
the
best
she
says
that
boys
who
expect
money
very
often
rely
upon
it
and
not
upon
themselves
she
would
rather
turn
us
out
into
the
world
with
our
talents
cultivated
and
a
will
to
use
them
than
with
a
fortune
apiece
there
not
a
parable
in
the
bible
mamma
is
fonder
of
reading
to
us
than
that
of
the
ten
talents
no
fortune
repeated
glenn
in
a
dreamy
tone
not
a
penny
mamma
has
to
work
to
keep
us
returned
frank
making
the
avowal
as
freely
as
though
he
had
proclaimed
that
his
mother
was
to
the
queen
and
he
one
of
her
pages
jane
had
contrived
to
convince
them
that
in
poverty
itself
there
lay
no
shame
or
stigma
but
a
great
deal
in
paltry
attempts
to
conceal
it
frank
said
glenn
i
was
thinking
that
you
must
possess
a
fortune
in
your
mother
and
so
we
do
said
frank
when
philip
note
came
to
me
last
night
and
we
were
were
laughing
over
it
suggested
glenn
helping
out
frank
hesitation
and
laughing
himself
yes
that
it
only
i
did
not
like
to
say
it
acknowledged
frank
but
i
dare
say
you
know
sir
how
most
of
the
college
boys
write
mamma
said
then
how
glad
we
ought
to
be
that
she
can
make
time
to
teach
us
better
and
that
we
have
the
resolution
to
persevere
i
wish
your
mother
would
admit
my
sons
to
her
class
said
glenn
i
would
give
her
any
recompense
shall
i
ask
her
cried
frank
perhaps
she
would
feel
hurt
oh
no
she
would
answered
frank
impulsively
i
will
ask
her
i
should
not
like
such
a
strict
mother
avowed
philip
glenn
strict
echoed
frank
mamma
not
strict
she
must
be
she
says
you
sha
come
fishing
with
us
no
she
did
not
she
said
she
wished
me
not
to
go
and
thought
i
had
better
not
and
then
she
left
it
to
me
philip
glenn
stared
you
told
me
at
school
this
morning
that
it
was
decided
you
were
not
to
come
and
now
you
say
halliburton
left
it
to
you
so
she
did
answered
frank
she
generally
leaves
these
things
to
us
she
shows
us
what
we
ought
to
do
and
why
it
is
right
that
we
should
do
it
and
then
she
leaves
it
to
what
she
calls
our
own
good
sense
it
is
like
putting
us
upon
our
honour
and
you
do
as
you
know
she
wishes
you
would
do
interposed
glenn
yes
sir
always
suppose
you
were
to
take
your
own
will
for
once
against
hers
cried
philip
in
a
cross
tone
what
then
then
i
dare
say
she
would
decide
herself
the
next
time
and
tell
us
we
were
not
to
be
trusted
but
there
no
fear
we
know
her
wishes
are
sure
to
be
right
and
we
would
not
vex
her
for
the
world
the
last
time
the
dean
was
here
there
was
a
fuss
about
the
choristers
getting
holiday
so
often
and
he
forbade
its
being
done
but
the
dean
away
impatiently
interrupted
philip
glenn
old
ripton
is
in
residence
and
he
would
give
it
you
for
the
asking
he
knows
nothing
about
the
dean
order
that
the
very
reason
returned
frank
mamma
put
it
to
me
whether
it
would
be
an
honourable
thing
to
do
she
said
if
ripton
had
known
of
the
dean
order
then
i
might
have
asked
him
and
he
could
do
as
he
pleased
she
makes
us
wish
to
do
what
is
right
not
only
what
appears
so
and
you
punish
yourself
by
going
without
the
holiday
for
some
rubbishing
notion
of
right
it
just
nonsense
frank
of
course
we
have
to
punish
ourselves
sometimes
acknowledged
frank
i
shall
be
wishing
all
day
long
that
i
was
with
you
but
when
evening
comes
and
the
day
over
then
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
done
right
mamma
says
if
we
do
not
learn
to
act
rightly
and
as
boys
we
shall
not
do
so
as
men
glenn
laid
his
hand
on
frank
shoulder
inculcate
your
creed
upon
my
sons
if
you
can
said
he
speaking
seriously
has
your
mother
taught
it
to
you
long
she
has
always
been
teaching
it
to
us
ever
since
we
were
little
rejoined
frank
if
we
had
to
begin
now
i
do
know
that
we
should
make
much
of
it
glenn
fell
into
a
reverie
as
ashley
had
once
judged
by
some
words
dropped
by
william
so
glenn
was
judging
now
that
halliburton
must
be
a
mother
in
a
thousand
frank
turned
to
philip
have
you
done
your
lessons
done
my
lessons
no
have
you
frank
laughed
yes
or
i
should
not
have
come
i
have
not
played
a
minute
but
cribbed
the
time
scanning
and
exercise
and
greek
i
have
done
them
all
it
seems
to
me
that
you
and
your
brothers
make
friends
of
your
lessons
whilst
most
boys
make
enemies
observed
glenn
yes
that
true
said
frank
philip
said
glenn
to
his
son
that
evening
after
frank
had
departed
i
give
you
to
bring
that
boy
here
as
much
as
you
like
if
you
are
wise
you
will
make
a
lasting
friend
of
him
i
like
the
halliburtons
replied
philip
the
college
school
does
though
and
pray
why
well
i
think
dare
senior
first
set
the
school
against
them
cyril
you
know
papa
he
was
always
going
on
at
them
they
were
snobs
for
sticking
to
their
lessons
he
said
which
gentlemen
never
did
and
they
were
snobs
because
they
had
no
money
to
spend
which
gentlemen
always
had
and
they
were
snobs
for
this
and
snobs
for
the
other
and
he
got
his
desk
which
ruled
the
school
to
cut
them
they
had
to
put
up
with
a
good
deal
then
but
they
are
bigger
now
and
can
fight
their
way
and
since
dare
senior
left
the
school
has
begun
to
like
them
if
they
are
poor
they
ca
help
it
concluded
philip
as
if
he
would
apologize
for
the
fact
poor
retorted
glenn
i
can
tell
you
master
philip
and
the
college
school
too
that
they
are
rich
in
things
that
you
want
unless
i
am
deceived
the
halliburtons
will
grow
up
to
be
men
of
no
common
order
chapter
xiii
making
progress
trifles
as
we
all
know
lead
to
great
events
when
frank
halliburton
had
gone
home
in
his
usual
flying
eager
manner
plunging
headlong
into
the
subject
of
glenn
request
and
jane
consented
to
grant
it
she
little
thought
that
it
would
lead
to
a
considerable
increase
to
her
income
enabling
them
to
procure
several
comforts
and
rendering
better
private
instruction
than
her
own
easy
for
her
sons
not
that
she
yielded
to
the
request
at
once
she
took
time
for
consideration
but
frank
was
urgent
and
she
was
one
of
those
ever
ready
to
do
a
good
turn
for
others
the
glenns
as
frank
said
did
write
english
wretchedly
and
if
she
could
help
to
improve
them
without
losing
time
or
money
neither
of
which
she
could
afford
why
not
do
so
and
she
consented
it
certainly
did
occur
to
halliburton
to
wonder
that
glenn
had
not
provided
private
instruction
for
his
sons
to
remedy
the
deficiencies
existing
in
the
college
school
system
glenn
suddenly
awoke
to
the
same
wonder
himself
the
fact
was
that
he
like
many
other
gentlemen
in
helstonleigh
who
had
sons
in
the
college
school
had
been
content
to
let
things
take
their
chance
possibly
he
assumed
that
spelling
and
composition
would
come
to
his
sons
by
intuition
as
they
grew
older
the
contrast
frank
halliburton
presented
to
philip
aroused
him
from
his
neglect
jane
consented
to
allow
the
two
young
glenns
to
share
the
time
and
instruction
she
gave
to
her
own
boys
glenn
received
the
favour
gladly
but
at
first
there
was
great
battling
with
the
young
gentlemen
themselves
they
could
not
be
made
to
complete
their
lessons
for
school
so
as
to
be
at
halliburton
by
the
hour
appointed
at
length
it
was
accomplished
and
they
took
to
going
regularly
before
three
months
had
elapsed
great
improvement
had
become
visible
in
their
spelling
they
were
also
acquiring
an
insight
into
english
grammar
had
learnt
that
america
was
not
situated
in
the
mediterranean
or
watered
by
the
nile
and
that
english
history
did
not
solely
consist
of
two
incidents
the
beheading
of
king
charles
and
the
gunpowder
plot
improvement
was
also
visible
in
their
manners
and
in
the
bent
of
their
minds
from
being
boisterous
and
careless
they
became
more
considerate
more
tractable
and
glenn
actually
once
heard
philip
decline
to
embark
in
some
tempting
scrape
because
it
would
not
be
right
for
it
was
impossible
for
jane
to
have
lads
near
her
and
not
gently
try
to
counteract
their
faults
and
failings
as
she
would
have
done
by
her
own
sons
whilst
the
remarkable
consideration
and
deference
paid
by
the
young
halliburtons
to
their
mother
their
warm
affection
for
her
and
the
pleasant
peace
the
refinement
of
tone
and
manner
distinguishing
their
home
told
upon
philip
and
charles
glenn
with
good
influence
at
the
end
of
three
months
glenn
wrote
a
note
of
warm
thanks
to
halliburton
expressing
a
hope
that
she
would
still
allow
his
sons
the
privilege
of
joining
her
own
and
in
a
delicate
manner
begging
grace
for
his
act
enclosed
four
guineas
which
was
payment
at
the
rate
of
sixteen
guineas
a
year
for
the
two
jane
had
not
expected
it
nothing
had
been
hinted
to
her
about
payment
and
she
did
not
expect
to
receive
any
she
did
not
understand
that
the
boys
had
joined
on
those
terms
it
was
very
welcome
in
writing
back
to
glenn
she
stated
that
she
had
not
expected
to
receive
remuneration
but
she
spoke
of
her
straitened
circumstances
and
thanked
him
for
the
help
it
would
be
that
comes
from
a
gentlewoman
was
his
remark
to
his
wife
when
he
read
the
note
i
should
like
to
know
her
i
hinted
as
much
to
frank
one
day
but
he
said
his
mother
was
too
much
occupied
to
receive
visits
or
to
pay
them
was
glenn
reply
as
it
happened
however
glenn
did
pay
her
a
visit
a
friend
of
his
whose
boys
were
in
the
college
school
struck
with
the
improvement
in
the
glenns
and
hearing
of
its
source
wondered
whether
his
boys
might
not
be
received
on
the
same
terms
and
glenn
undertook
to
propose
it
the
result
of
all
this
was
that
in
six
months
from
the
time
of
that
afternoon
when
frank
first
took
tea
at
glenn
jane
had
ten
evening
pupils
college
boys
there
she
stopped
others
applied
but
her
table
would
not
hold
more
nor
could
she
do
justice
to
a
greater
number
the
ten
would
bring
her
in
eighty
guineas
a
year
she
devoted
to
them
two
hours
five
evenings
in
the
week
now
she
could
command
somewhat
better
food
and
more
liberal
instruction
for
her
own
boys
william
included
in
those
higher
branches
of
knowledge
which
they
could
not
or
had
not
commenced
for
themselves
a
learned
professor
david
byrne
whose
lodgings
were
in
the
london
road
was
applied
to
and
he
agreed
to
receive
the
young
halliburtons
at
a
very
moderate
charge
three
evenings
in
the
week
mamma
cried
william
one
day
with
his
thoughtful
smile
soon
after
this
agreement
was
entered
upon
we
seem
to
be
getting
on
amazingly
we
can
learn
something
else
now
if
you
have
no
objection
what
is
that
asked
jane
french
as
i
and
samuel
lynn
were
walking
home
we
met
monsieur
colin
he
said
he
was
about
to
organize
a
french
class
twelve
in
number
and
would
be
glad
if
we
would
make
three
of
the
number
what
do
you
say
it
is
a
great
temptation
answered
jane
i
have
long
wished
you
could
learn
french
would
it
be
very
expensive
very
cheap
to
us
he
said
he
considered
you
a
sister
professor
the
idea
burst
forth
frank
hotly
mamma
a
professor
indeed
i
do
know
that
i
can
aspire
to
anything
so
formidable
said
jane
with
a
laugh
a
schoolmistress
would
be
a
better
word
frank
was
indignant
you
are
not
a
schoolmistress
mamma
i
frank
interrupted
jane
her
tone
changing
to
seriousness
what
mamma
i
am
to
be
one
the
tears
rose
to
frank
eyes
you
are
a
mamma
i
shall
never
think
you
anything
else
there
jane
smiled
well
i
hope
i
am
frank
although
i
help
to
make
gloves
and
teach
boys
english
how
well
lynn
speaks
french
exclaimed
william
does
he
speak
it
as
a
native
i
can
not
tell
what
his
accent
may
be
but
he
speaks
it
as
readily
as
monsieur
colin
shall
we
learn
mamma
it
will
be
the
greatest
advantage
to
us
monsieur
colin
conversing
with
us
in
french
but
what
about
the
time
william
oh
if
you
will
manage
the
money
we
will
manage
the
time
returned
william
laughing
only
trust
to
us
mother
we
will
make
it
and
neglect
nothing
then
william
you
may
tell
monsieur
colin
that
you
shall
learn
fair
and
easy
broke
out
frank
a
saying
of
his
when
pleased
mamma
i
think
what
with
one
thing
and
another
turning
up
we
boys
shall
be
getting
quite
education
although
mamma
feared
we
never
should
accomplish
it
returned
william
as
did
i
fear
cried
frank
i
did
i
knew
that
there
a
will
there
a
way
animos
timor
added
he
finishing
off
with
one
of
his
favourite
latin
quotations
but
forgetting
in
his
flourish
that
he
was
paying
a
poor
compliment
to
his
mother
and
his
brother
chapter
xiv
william
halliburton
ghost
this
chapter
may
be
said
to
commence
the
second
part
of
this
history
for
some
years
have
elapsed
since
the
events
last
recorded
do
you
doubt
that
the
patience
displayed
by
jane
halliburton
her
persevering
struggles
her
industry
joined
to
her
trust
in
the
goodness
and
guidance
of
the
most
high
god
could
fail
to
bring
their
reward
it
is
not
possible
but
do
not
fancy
that
it
came
suddenly
in
the
shape
of
a
rewards
worth
having
are
not
acquired
so
easily
have
you
met
with
the
following
lines
they
are
somewhat
applicable
how
rarely
friend
a
good
great
man
inherits
honour
and
wealth
with
all
his
worth
and
pains
it
seems
a
fable
from
the
land
of
spirits
when
any
man
obtains
that
which
he
merits
or
any
merits
that
which
he
obtains
for
shame
my
friend
renounce
this
idle
strain
what
thou
have
the
good
great
man
obtain
wealth
title
dignity
a
golden
chain
or
heaps
of
corpses
which
his
sword
hath
slain
goodness
and
greatness
are
not
means
but
ends
hath
he
not
always
treasures
always
friends
the
good
great
man
three
treasures
love
and
life
and
calm
thoughts
equable
as

jane
reward
was
in
progress
it
had
not
fully
come
at
present
it
was
little
more
than
that
of
an
approving
conscience
for
having
fought
her
way
through
difficulties
in
the
patient
continuance
of
and
in
the
fulfilment
in
a
remarkable
manner
of
the
subject
she
had
had
most
at
heart
that
of
giving
her
sons
an
education
that
would
fit
them
to
fulfil
any
part
they
might
be
called
upon
to
play
in
the
destinies
of
life
in
watching
them
grow
up
full
of
promise
to
make
good
and
great
men
in
circumstances
jane
was
tolerably
at
ease
now
time
had
wrought
its
changes
reece
had
gone
not
into
other
lodgings
but
to
join
janey
halliburton
on
the
long
journey
and
dobbs
dobbs
was
servant
to
halliburton
dobbs
had
experienced
misfortune
dobbs
had
put
by
a
good
round
sum
in
a
bank
for
dobbs
had
been
provident
all
her
life
and
the
bank
broke
and
swallowed
up
dobbs
savings
and
nearly
all
surly
independence
went
with
it
misfortunes
do
not
come
alone
and
reece
died
almost
immediately
after
dobbs
treacherous
bank
went
the
old
lady
will
had
been
good
to
leave
dobbs
something
but
she
had
not
the
power
to
do
so
the
income
she
had
enjoyed
went
at
her
death
to
her
late
husband
relatives
she
had
made
dobbs
handsome
presents
from
time
to
time
and
these
dobbs
had
placed
with
the
rest
of
her
money
it
had
all
gone
poor
dobbs
good
for
nothing
in
the
first
shock
of
the
loss
paid
halliburton
for
a
bedroom
weekly
and
sat
down
to
fret
next
she
tried
to
earn
a
living
at
making
gloves
an
employment
dobbs
had
followed
in
her
early
days
but
what
with
not
being
so
young
as
she
was
neither
eyes
nor
fingers
dobbs
found
she
could
make
nothing
of
the
work
she
went
about
the
house
doing
odd
tasks
for
halliburton
until
that
lady
ventured
on
a
proposal
with
as
much
deference
as
though
she
had
been
making
it
to
an
indian
begum
that
dobbs
should
remain
with
her
as
her
servant
an
experienced
thoroughly
good
servant
she
required
now
and
that
she
knew
dobbs
to
be
dobbs
acquiesced
and
forthwith
went
upstairs
moved
her
things
into
the
dark
closet
and
obstinately
adopted
it
as
her
own
bedroom
the
death
of
reece
had
enabled
jane
to
put
into
practice
a
plan
she
had
long
thought
of
that
of
receiving
boarders
into
her
house
after
the
manner
of
the
dames
at
eton
some
of
the
foundation
boys
in
the
college
school
lived
at
a
distance
and
it
was
a
great
matter
with
the
parents
to
place
them
in
families
where
they
would
find
a
good
home
the
wife
of
the
head
master
keating
took
in
jane
thought
she
might
do
the
same
she
had
been
asked
to
do
so
but
had
not
room
while
reece
was
with
her
she
still
held
her
class
in
the
evening
as
one
set
of
boys
finished
with
her
others
were
only
too
glad
to
take
their
places
there
was
no
teaching
like
halliburton
upon
making
it
known
that
she
could
receive
boarders
applications
poured
in
and
six
all
she
had
accommodation
for
came
they
of
course
attended
the
college
school
during
the
day
thus
she
could
afford
to
relinquish
working
at
the
gloves
and
did
so
to
samuel
chagrin
a
steady
regular
worker
as
jane
had
been
was
valuable
to
the
manufactory
altogether
what
with
her
evening
class
and
the
sum
paid
by
the
boarders
her
income
was
between
two
and
three
hundred
a
year
not
including
what
was
earned
by
william
william
had
made
progress
at
ashley
and
now
earned
thirty
shillings

left
the
college
school
time
was
out
and
more
than
out
but
when
a
scholar
advanced
in
the
manner
that
frank
halliburton
had
done
keating
was
not
in
a
hurry
to
intimate
to
him
that
his
time
had
expired
so
frank
remained
on
studying
hard
one
of
the
most
finished
scholars
helstonleigh
collegiate
school
had
ever
turned
out
there
sat
one
great
desire
in
frank
heart
it
had
almost
grown
into
a
passion
it
coloured
his
dreams
by
night
and
his
thoughts
by
day
that
of
matriculating
at
one
of
the
two
universities
the
random
and
somewhat
dim
idea
of
frank
early
days
studying
for
the
bar
had
become
the
fixed
purpose
of
his
life
that
he
was
especially
gifted
with
the
tastes
and
qualifications
necessary
to
make
a
good
pleader
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
therefore
frank
had
probably
not
mistaken
his
vocation
persevering
in
study
keen
in
perceptive
intellect
equable
in
temper
fluent
and
persuasive
in
speech
a
true
type
was
he
of
an
embryo
barrister
he
did
not
quite
see
his
way
yet
to
getting
to
college
neither
did
gar
and
gar
had
set
mind
upon
the
church
one
cold
january
evening
bright
clear
and
frosty
samuel
lynn
stopped
away
from
the
manufactory
he
had
received
a
letter
by
the
evening
post
saying
that
a
friend
on
his
way
from
birmingham
to
bristol
would
halt
for
a
few
hours
at
his
house
and
go
on
by
the
bristol
mail
which
passed
through
the
city
at
eleven
the
friend
arrived
punctually
was
regaled
with
tea
and
other
good
things
in
the
state
parlour
and
he
and
samuel
lynn
settled
themselves
to
enjoy
a
pleasant
evening
together
patience
and
anna
forming
part
of
the
company
anna
luxuriant
curls
and
her
wondrous
beauty
for
in
growing
up
that
beauty
had
not
belied
the
promise
of
her
childhood
were
shaded
under
the
demure
quaker
cap
something
else
had
not
belied
the
promise
of
her
childhood
and
that
was
her
vanity
apparently
she
did
not
find
the
evening
or
the
visitor
to
her
taste
he
was
old
as
were
her
father
and
patience
every
one
above
thirty
anna
was
apt
to
class
as
old
she
fidgeted
was
restless
and
just
as
the
clock
struck
seven
as
if
the
sound
rendered
any
further
inaction
unbearable
she
rose
and
was
quietly
stealing
from
the
room
where
are
thee
going
anna
asked
her
father
anna
coloured
as
if
taken
by
surprise
friend
jane
halliburton
promised
to
lend
me
a
book
father
i
should
like
to
fetch
it
sit
thee
still
child
thee
dost
not
want
to
read
when
friend
stanley
is
with
us
show
him
thy
drawings
meanwhile
i
will
get
the
chessmen
thee
like
a
game
turning
to
his
visitor
ay
i
should
was
the
ready
answer
remember
friend
lynn
i
beat
thee
last
time
maybe
my
skill
will
redeem
itself
nodded
the
quaker
as
he
rose
for
the
chessboard
it
shall
try
its
best
would
thee
like
a
candle
asked
patience
who
was
busy
sewing
not
at
all
my
chamber
is
light
as
day
with
the
moon
so
near
the
full
lynn
went
up
to
his
room
the
chessboard
and
men
were
kept
on
a
table
near
the
window
as
he
took
them
from
it
he
glanced
out
at
the
pleasant
scene
his
window
at
the
back
faced
the
charming
landscape
and
the
malvern
hills
in
the
horizon
shone
out
almost
as
distinctly
as
by
day
not
however
on
the
landscape
were
samuel
lynn
eyes
fixed
they
had
caught
something
nearer
which
drew
his
attention
pacing
the
which
ran
behind
his
low
garden
hedge
was
a
male
figure
in
a
cloak
to
see
a
man
whether
with
a
cloak
or
without
it
abroad
on
a
moonlight
night
would
not
have
been
extraordinary
but
samuel
lynn
notice
was
drawn
by
this
one
movements
beyond
the
immediate
space
occupied
by
the
house
the
was
hidden
on
one
side
by
the
high
hedge
intervening
between
his
garden
and
halliburton
on
the
other
by
a
wall
the
figure
whoever
it
might
be
would
come
to
one
of
these
corners
stealthily
peep
at
samuel
house
and
windows
and
then
continue
his
way
past
it
until
he
reached
the
other
corner
where
he
would
halt
and
peep
again
partially
hiding
himself
behind
the
hedge
that
he
was
waiting
for
something
or
some
one
was
apparent
for
he
stamped
his
feet
occasionally
in
an
impatient
manner
what
can
it
be
that
he
does
there
cried
the
quaker
half
aloud
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
seen
him
he
can
not
be
taking
a
sketch
of
my
house
by
moonlight
were
it
any
other
than
thee
william
halliburton
i
should
say
it
wore
a
clandestine
look
he
returned
to
the
parlour
and
took
his
revenge
on
his
friend
by
checkmating
him
three
times
in
succession
at
nine
supper
came
in
and
at
ten
stanley
accompanied
by
samuel
lynn
left
to
walk
leisurely
into
helstonleigh
and
await
the
bristol
mail
as
they
turned
out
of
the
house
they
saw
william
halliburton
going
in
at
his
own
door
it
is
a
cold
night
william
remarked
to
lynn
very
good
night
to
thee
you
can
not
see
what
he
is
like
by
this
light
especially
in
that
disguising
cloak
and
the
cap
with
its
protecting
ears
but
you
can
see
him
the
following
morning
as
he
stands
in
ashley
a
upright
noble
form
a
head
taller
than
samuel
lynn
by
whose
side
he
is
standing
with
a
peculiarly
attractive
face
not
for
its
beauty
the
face
can
not
boast
of
very
much
but
for
its
broad
brow
of
intellect
its
firm
sweet
mouth
and
its
truthful
eyes
none
could
mistake
william
halliburton
for
anything
but
a
gentleman
although
they
had
seen
him
as
now
with
a
white
apron
tied
round
his
waist
william
was
making
up
gloves
a
term
as
you
may
remember
which
means
sorting
them
according
to
their
qualities
work
that
was
sometimes
done
in
ashley
room
on
account
of
its
steady
light
for
it
bore
a
north
aspect
a
table
or
counter
was
fixed
down
one
side
under
its
windows
lynn
stood
by
his
side
looking
on
thee
can
do
it
tolerably
well
william
he
observed
after
some
minutes
close
inspection
william
smiled
the
quaker
never
bestowed
decided
praise
and
never
thought
any
one
could
be
trusted
in
the
department
himself
and
james
meeking
excepted
william
had
been
exercised
in
the
for
the
past
eighteen
months
and
he
thought
he
ought
to
do
it
pretty
well
by
this
time
lynn
was
turning
away
when
his
keen
sight
fell
on
several
dozens
at
a
little
distance
he
took
up
one
of
the
top
pairs
with
a
hasty
movement
knitted
his
brow
and
then
took
up
others
thee
has
not
exercised
thy
judgment
or
thy
caution
here
friend
william
i
did
not
make
up
those
replied
william
who
did
then
cyril
dare
i
have
told
cyril
dare
he
is
not
to
attempt
the
returned
samuel
lynn
in
severe
tones
when
did
he
do
these
yesterday
afternoon
there
again
he
knows
the
gloves
are
not
made
up
in
a
afternoon
i
myself
would
not
do
it
by
so
obscure
a
light
thee
go
over
these
thyself
when
thee
has
finished
the
stack
before
thee
samuel
lynn
was
not
one
who
spared
work
he
mixed
the
offending
dozens
together
indiscriminately
and
pushed
them
towards
william
then
he
turned
to
his
own
place
and
went
on
with
his
work
he
was
also
making
up
presently
he
spoke
again
what
does
thee
do
at
the
back
of
my
house
of
a
night
thee
must
find
the
walk
cold
william
turned
his
head
with
a
movement
of
surprise
i
do
do
anything
at
the
back
of
your
house
what
do
you
mean
not
walk
about
there
watching
it
as
thee
did
last
night
certainly
not
i
do
not
understand
you
samuel
lynn
brows
knit
heavily
william
i
deemed
thee
truthful
why
deny
what
is
a
palpable
fact
william
halliburton
put
down
the
pair
of
gloves
he
had
in
his
hand
and
turned
to
the
quaker
in
saying
that
i
do
not
walk
at
the
back
of
your
house
at
night
or
at
the
back
of
any
house
i
state
the
truth
last
night
at
seven
i
thee
parading
there
in
thy
cloak
i
saw
thee
i
say
william
the
night
was
unusually
light
last
night
from
until
nine
i
never
stirred
out
of
my
mother
parlour
rejoined
william
i
was
at
my
books
as
usual
at
nine
i
ran
up
to
say
a
word
to
henry
ashley
you
saw
me
returning
but
i
saw
thee
at
the
back
with
my
own
eyes
persisted
the
quaker
i
saw
thy
cloak
thee
had
on
that
blue
cap
of
thine
it
was
tied
down
over
thy
ears
and
the
collar
of
the
cloak
was
turned
up
to
protect
thee
as
i
surmised
from
the
cold
it
must
have
been
my
ghost
responded
william
i
be
likely
to
pace
up
and
down
a
cold
field
for
pastime
on
a
january
night
will
thee
oblige
me
by
putting
on
thy
cloak
was
all
the
answer
returned
by
samuel
lynn
what
now
please
william
laughing
went
out
of
the
room
and
came
back
in
his
cloak
it
was
an
cloak
a
remarkable
cloak
a
dark
plaid
its
collar
lined
with
red
formerly
worn
by
gentlemen
they
had
now
become
nearly
obsolete
but
william
had
picked
this
up
for
much
less
than
half
its
value
he
did
not
care
much
for
fashion
and
it
was
warm
and
comfortable
in
winter
weather
perhaps
you
wish
me
to
put
on
my
cap
said
william
in
a
tone
yes
and
turn
down
the
ears
he
obeyed
very
much
amused
anything
more
asked
he
walk
thyself
about
an
instant
his
lips
smiling
his
eyes
dancing
william
marched
from
one
side
of
the
room
to
the
other
while
this
was
in
process
cyril
dare
bustled
in
and
stood
in
amazement
staring
at
william
the
quaker
paid
no
attention
to
his
arrival
except
that
he
took
out
his
watch
and
glanced
at
it
he
continued
to
address
william
and
thee
can
assure
me
to
my
face
that
thee
was
not
pacing
the
field
last
night
in
the
moonlight
dressed
as
now
i
can
and
do
replied
william
then
william
it
is
one
of
two
things
my
eyes
or
thy
word
must
be
false
did
you
see
my
face
asked
william
not
much
of
that
with
the
ears
down
and
the
collar
up
thy
face
was
pretty
effectually
concealed
there
not
another
cloak
like
thine
in
all
helstonleigh
you
are
right
there
laughed
william
there
not
one
half
so
handsome
admire
the
contrast
of
the
purple
and
green
plaid
and
the
scarlet
collar
no
not
another
like
it
emphatically
repeated
the
quaker
i
tell
thee
william
halliburton
in
the
teeth
of
thy
denial
that
i
saw
thee
or
a
figure
precisely
similar
to
thee
parading
the
last
night
and
stealthily
watching
my
windows
it
a
clear
case
of
ghost
returned
william
with
an
amused
look
at
cyril
dare
how
much
longer
am
i
to
make
a
walking
guy
of
myself
for
your
pleasure
and
cyril
astonishment
thee
can
take
it
off
replied
the
quaker
his
curt
tone
betraying
dissatisfaction
until
that
moment
he
had
believed
william
halliburton
to
be
the
very
quintessence
of
truth
his
belief
was
now
shaken
in
the
small
passage
between
ashley
room
and
samuel
lynn
william
hung
up
the
cloak
and
cap
the
quaker
turned
to
cyril
dare
who
was
taking
off
his
stern
displeasure
in
his
tone
dost
thee
know
the
time
just
gone
nine
replied
cyril
lynn
held
out
his
watch
to
cyril
it
wanted
seventeen
minutes
to
ten
nine
is
thy
hour
i
am
tired
of
telling
thee
to
be
more
punctual
and
thee
did
not
come
before
breakfast
i
overslept
myself
said
cyril
as
thee
dost
pretty
often
it
seems
if
thee
can
do
no
better
than
thee
did
yesterday
as
well
oversleep
thyself
for
good
look
at
these
gloves
well
cried
cyril
who
was
a
young
man
in
stature
not
far
short
of
william
at
least
he
would
have
been
but
for
his
eyes
there
was
a
look
in
them
almost
amounting
to
a
squint
and
they
did
not
gaze
openly
and
honestly
into
another
eyes
his
face
was
thin
and
his
features
were
well
cried
he
it
is
well
repeated
the
quaker
well
that
i
looked
at
them
for
they
must
be
done
again
firsts
are
mixed
with
seconds
thirds
with
firsts
i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
saw
gloves
so
ill
made
up
what
have
i
told
thee
lots
of
things
responded
cyril
who
liked
to
set
the
manager
at
defiance
as
far
as
he
dared
i
have
desired
thee
never
to
attempt
to
make
up
the
gloves
i
now
forbid
thee
again
and
thee
will
do
well
not
to
forget
it
begin
and
band
these
gloves
that
william
halliburton
is
making
ready
cyril
jerked
open
the
drawer
where
the
paper
bands
were
kept
took
some
out
of
it
and
carried
them
to
the
counter
where
william
stood
lynn
interposed
with
another
order
thee
will
please
put
thy
apron
on
now
having
to
wear
this
apron
was
the
very
bugbear
of
cyril
life
there
no
need
of
an
apron
to
paper
gloves
he
responded
thee
will
put
on
thy
apron
friend
calmly
repeated
samuel
lynn
i
hate
the
apron
fumed
cyril
jerking
open
another
drawer
and
jerking
out
his
apron
for
he
might
not
openly
disobey
the
authority
of
samuel
lynn
i
should
think
i
am
the
first
gentleman
that
ever
was
made
to
wear
one
if
thee
are
practically
engaged
in
a
glove
manufactory
thee
must
wear
an
apron
gentleman
or
no
gentleman
equably
returned
the
quaker
as
we
all
do
all
do
retorted
cyril
the
master
does
not
thee
are
not
in
the
master
position
yet
cyril
dare
and
i
would
advise
thee
to
exercise
thy
discretion
more
and
thy
tongue
less
the
discussion
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
ashley
and
the
room
dropped
into
silence
there
might
be
no
presuming
in
the
presence
of
the
master
he
sat
down
to
his
desk
and
opened
his
morning
letters
presently
a
young
man
put
his
head
in
and
addressed
samuel
lynn
noaks
the
stainer
has
come
in
sir
he
says
the
skins
given
out
to
him
yesterday
would
be
better
for
coloured
than
blacks
desire
james
meeking
to
attend
to
him
said
lynn
james
meeking
is
here
sir
he
up
in
the
cutters
room
or
somewhere
samuel
lynn
upon
this
went
out
himself
cyril
dare
followed
him
cyril
was
rather
fond
of
taking
short
trips
about
the
manufactory
as
interludes
to
his
work
soon
after
the
master
lifted
his
head
step
here
william
william
put
down
the
gloves
he
was
examining
and
approached
the
desk
what
sort
of
a
french
scholar
are
you
inquired
ashley
a
very
good
one
sir
he
replied
after
a
pause
given
to
surprise
i
know
it
thoroughly
i
can
read
and
write
it
as
readily
as
i
can
english
but
i
mean
as
to
speaking
could
you
make
yourself
understood
for
instance
if
you
were
suddenly
dropped
down
into
a
french
town
where
the
natives
spoke
nothing
but
their
own
language
william
smiled
i
do
think
i
should
have
much
difficulty
over
it
i
have
been
so
much
with
monsieur
colin
that
i
talk
as
fast
as
he
does
he
stops
me
occasionally
to
grumble
at
what
he
calls
i
am
not
sure
that
i
shall
not
send
you
on
a
mission
to
france
resumed
ashley
you
can
be
better
spared
than
samuel
lynn
and
it
must
be
one
of
you
will
you
undertake
it
i
will
undertake
anything
that
you
wish
me
to
do
sir
that
i
could
accomplish
replied
william
lifting
his
clear
earnest
eyes
to
those
of
his
master
you
are
an
exceedingly
good
judge
of
skins
even
samuel
lynn
admits
that
i
want
some
intelligent
trustworthy
person
to
go
over
to
france
look
about
the
markets
there
and
pick
up
what
will
suit
us
the
demand
for
skins
is
great
at
the
present
time
and
the
markets
must
be
watched
to
select
suitable
bales
before
other
bidders
step
in
and
pounce
upon
them
by
these
means
we
may
secure
some
good
bargains
and
good
skins
we
have
succeeded
lately
in
doing
neither
at
annonay
i
presume
you
mean
sir
annonay
and
its
neighbourhood
that
the
chief
market
for
dressed
skins
the
undressed
pelts
are
to
be
met
with
best
as
you
are
aware
in
the
neighbourhood
of
lyons
you
would
have
to
look
after
both
i
have
talked
the
matter
over
with
lynn
and
he
thinks
you
may
be
trusted
both
as
to
ability
and
conduct
i
will
do
my
best
if
i
am
sent
replied
william
your
stay
might
extend
over
two
or
three
months
we
can
do
with
a
great
deal
both
of
pelts
and
dressed
skins
the
dressers
at
annonay
cyril
what
are
you
doing
there
cyril
could
scarcely
have
told
he
had
come
into
the
unnoticed
and
his
ears
had
picked
up
somewhat
of
the
conversation
in
his
anger
and
annoyance
cyril
had
remained
his
face
turned
towards
the
speakers
listening
for
more
for
it
had
oozed
out
at
pomeranian
knoll
through
a
word
dropped
by
henry
ashley
that
ashley
had
it
in
contemplation
to
despatch
some
one
from
the
manufactory
on
this
mission
to
france
and
that
the
some
one
would
not
be
samuel
lynn
cyril
received
the
information
with
avidity
never
doubting
that
would
be
the
one
fixed
upon
to
give
him
his
due
he
was
really
a
good
judge
of
skins
not
better
than
william
but
somehow
cyril
had
never
given
a
thought
to
william
in
the
matter
greatly
had
he
anticipated
the
journey
to
the
land
of
pleasure
where
he
would
be
under
no
one
control
but
his
own
in
that
moment
when
he
heard
ashley
speaking
to
william
upon
the
subject
not
to
him
cyril
felt
at
war
with
every
one
and
everything
with
the
master
with
william
and
especially
with
the
business
which
he
hated
as
much
as
he
had
ever
done
but
ashley
was
not
one
to
do
things
in
a
hurry
and
he
had
only
broached
the
subject
chapter
xv
nothing
risk
nothing
win
it
was
saturday
night
the
saturday
after
the
above
conversation
and
lynn
was
making
ready
to
pay
the
men
james
meeking
was
payer
in
a
general
way
but
james
meeking
was
also
packer
that
is
he
packed
with
assistance
the
goods
destined
for
london
a
parcel
was
being
sent
off
this
evening
so
that
it
fell
to
lynn
lot
to
pay
the
workmen
he
stood
before
the
desk
in
the
counting
out
the
money
in
readiness
there
was
a
quantity
of
silver
in
a
bag
and
a
great
many
brown
paper
packets
of
halfpence
each
packet
containing
five
shillings
but
they
all
had
to
be
counted
for
sometimes
a
packet
would
run
a
penny
or
twopence
short
the
door
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
was
heard
to
open
and
a
man
step
came
up
it
proved
to
be
a
workman
from
a
neighbouring
manufactory
if
you
please
lynn
could
you
oblige
our
people
with
twelve
or
fourteen
pounds
worth
of
change
he
asked
we
could
get
in
enough
try
as
we
would
the
halfpence
seem
as
scarce
as
the
silver
now
it
happened
that
the
ashley
manufactory
was
that
evening
abundantly
supplied
samuel
lynn
went
into
the
to
the
master
who
was
seated
at
the
desk
the
dunns
have
sent
in
to
know
if
we
can
oblige
them
with
twelve
or
fourteen
pounds
worth
of
change
said
he
we
have
plenty
but
to
send
away
so
much
may
run
us
very
short
dost
thee
happen
to
have
any
gold
that
thee
can
spare
ashley
looked
at
his
own
cash
drawer
here
are
six
seven
sovereigns
that
will
be
sufficient
replied
samuel
lynn
taking
them
from
his
hand
and
going
back
to
the
applicant
in
the
how
much
has
thee
need
of
asked
he
fourteen
pounds
please
sir
i
have
the
cheque
here
made
out
for
it
silver
or
copper
it
does
matter
which
or
a
little
gold
i
have
brought
a
basket
along
with
me
lynn
gave
the
money
and
took
the
cheque
the
man
departed
and
the
quaker
carried
the
cheque
to
ashley
ashley
put
the
cheque
into
one
of
the
of
his
desk
he
had
the
account
in
duplicate
before
him
of
the
goods
going
off
and
was
casting
it
up
william
and
cyril
were
both
in
the
but
not
engaged
with
ashley
william
was
marking
small
figures
on
certain
banded
gloves
cyril
was
looking
on
an
employment
that
suited
cyril
amazingly
his
want
of
occupation
caught
the
quaker
eye
if
thee
has
nothing
to
do
thee
can
come
and
help
me
count
the
papers
of
coppers
cyril
dared
not
say
no
before
ashley
he
might
have
hesitated
to
say
it
to
samuel
lynn
nevertheless
it
was
a
work
he
especially
disliked
it
is
pleasant
to
soil
the
fingers
counting
innumerable
packets
of
copper
money
to
part
them
into
stacks
of
twelve
pence
or
halfpence
in
point
of
fact
it
was
james
meeking
work
but
there
were
times
when
samuel
lynn
william
and
cyril
had
each
to
take
his
turn
at
it
perhaps
the
two
former
liked
it
no
better
than
did
cyril
dare
cyril
ungraciously
followed
to
the
in
a
few
minutes
james
meeking
looked
in
at
the
is
the
master
ready
ashley
rose
and
went
into
the
next
room
carrying
one
of
the
duplicate
lists
the
men
were
waiting
to
pack
james
meeking
and
the
other
packer
a
young
man
named
dance
the
several
papers
of
boxes
were
ready
on
a
side
counter
and
ashley
stood
with
the
list
in
his
hand
ready
to
verify
them
had
samuel
lynn
not
been
occupied
with
serving
he
would
have
done
this
three
dozen
best
men
outsizes
coloured
called
out
james
meeking
reading
the
marks
on
the
first
parcel
he
took
up
right
responded
ashley
james
meeking
laid
it
upon
the
clear
except
for
an
enormous
sheet
of
brown
paper
as
thick
as
turned
to
the
side
counter
and
took
up
another
of
the
parcels
three
dozen
best
men
outsizes
coloured
repeated
he
right
replied
ashley
and
so
on
till
all
the
parcels
were
told
through
and
were
found
to
tally
with
the
invoice
then
began
the
packing
it
made
a
large
parcel
about
four
feet
square
ashley
remained
looking
on
you
will
not
have
enough
string
there
he
observed
as
the
men
were
placing
the
string
round
it
in
squares
i
told
you
we
should
meeking
said
george
dance
there
no
more
downstairs
was
meeking
answer
i
thought
it
might
be
enough
neither
of
the
men
could
leave
the
parcel
they
were
mounted
on
steps
on
either
side
of
it
ashley
called
to
william
light
the
lantern
and
go
upstairs
to
the
bring
down
a
ball
candles
were
not
allowed
to
be
carried
about
the
premises
william
came
forth
lighted
the
lantern
and
went
upstairs
at
the
same
moment
cyril
dare
who
had
finished
his
disagreeable
copper
counting
strolled
into
the
finding
it
empty
he
thought
he
could
not
do
better
than
take
a
survey
of
ashley
desk
the
lid
of
which
was
propped
open
he
had
no
particular
motive
in
doing
this
except
that
that
receptacle
might
present
some
food
or
other
to
gratify
his
curiosity
which
the
counters
could
not
be
supposed
to
do
amidst
other
things
his
eyes
fell
on
the
dunns
cheque
which
lay
in
one
of
the
it
would
set
me
up
for
a
fortnight
that
fourteen
pounds
ejaculated
he
no
one
would
find
it
out
either
ashley
would
suspect
any
one
in
the
manufactory
before
he
suspect
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
indecision
his
hand
stretched
out
should
it
be
drawn
back
and
the
temptation
resisted
or
should
he
yield
to
it
here
goes
cried
cyril
nothing
risk
nothing
win
he
transferred
the
cheque
to
his
own
pocket
and
stole
out
of
the
into
the
small
narrow
passage
which
intervened
between
it
and
lynn
room
where
the
parcel
was
being
made
up
passing
stealthily
through
the
room
at
the
back
of
the
huge
parcel
which
hid
him
from
the
eyes
of
the
men
and
of
ashley
he
emerged
in
safety
into
the
took
up
his
position
close
to
samuel
lynn
and
began
assiduously
to
count
over
some
shilling
stacks
which
he
had
already
verified
samuel
lynn
his
face
turned
to
the
crowd
of
men
who
were
on
the
other
side
the
counter
receiving
their
wages
had
not
noticed
the
absence
of
cyril
dare
upon
this
probable
fact
cyril
had
reckoned
any
more
to
count
asked
cyril
samuel
lynn
turned
his
head
round
not
if
thee
has
finished
all
the
packets
had
he
seen
what
had
just
taken
place
he
might
have
entrusted
packets
of
coppers
to
cyril
less
confidently
cyril
jumped
upon
the
edge
of
the
desk
and
remained
perched
there
william
halliburton
came
back
with
the
twine
which
he
handed
to
george
dance
blowing
out
the
lantern
he
returned
to
the
the
parcel
was
completed
and
james
meeking
directed
it
in
his
plain
hand
james
morrison
dillon
and
fore
street
london
it
was
then
conveyed
to
a
truck
in
waiting
to
be
wheeled
to
the
parcels
office
ashley
returned
to
his
desk
and
sat
down
presently
cyril
dare
came
in
halliburton
do
you
want
to
be
paid
every
one
paid
but
you
lynn
waiting
to
close
the
desk
here
is
a
letter
for
the
post
william
called
out
ashley
i
am
coming
back
sir
i
have
not
set
the
counter
straight
yet
he
received
his
money
thirty
shillings
a
week
now
he
then
put
things
straight
in
the
to
do
which
was
as
much
cyril
work
as
his
and
took
a
letter
from
the
hands
of
ashley
it
contained
one
of
the
duplicate
lists
and
was
addressed
as
the
parcel
had
been
william
generally
had
charge
of
the
letters
now
he
did
not
forget
them
as
he
had
done
in
his
first
unlucky
essay
he
threw
on
the
elegant
cloak
of
which
you
have
heard
took
his
hat
and
went
through
the
town
as
far
as
the
cyril
dare
walking
with
him
there
they
parted
cyril
continuing
his
way
homewards
william
retracing
his
steps
all
had
left
the
manufactory
except
ashley
and
samuel
lynn
james
meeking
had
gone
down
on
a
late
night
as
the
present
when
all
had
done
except
the
master
and
samuel
lynn
the
latter
would
sometimes
say
to
the
foreman
thee
can
go
on
to
thy
supper
i
will
lock
up
and
bring
thee
the
keys
ashley
was
setting
his
desk
straight
putting
sundry
papers
in
their
places
tearing
up
others
he
unlocked
his
cash
drawer
and
put
his
hand
into
the
for
the
cheque
it
was
not
there
neither
there
nor
anywhere
that
he
could
see
why
where
that
cheque
he
exclaimed
it
caused
samuel
lynn
to
turn
cheque
he
repeated
dunns
cheque
that
you
brought
me
an
hour
ago
i
saw
thee
put
it
in
the
second
said
the
quaker
advancing
to
the
desk
and
standing
by
ashley
i
know
i
did
but
it
is
gone
thee
must
have
moved
it
perhaps
it
is
in
thy
private
drawer
ashley
shook
his
head
he
was
deep
in
consideration
i
have
not
touched
it
since
i
placed
it
there
he
presently
said
unless
surely
i
can
not
have
torn
it
up
by
mistake
he
and
samuel
lynn
both
stooped
over
the
basket
they
could
detect
nothing
of
the
sort
amidst
its
contents
ashley
was
nonplussed
this
is
a
curious
thing
samuel
said
he
no
one
was
in
the
room
during
my
absence
except
william
halliburton
he
would
not
meddle
with
thy
desk
observed
the
quaker
no
nor
suffer
any
one
else
to
meddle
with
it
i
should
like
to
see
william
he
may
possibly
throw
some
light
upon
the
subject
the
cheque
could
not
vanish
into
thin
air
samuel
lynn
went
down
to
james
meeking
whom
he
disturbed
at
supper
he
bade
him
watch
at
the
for
the
return
of
william
from
the
and
request
him
to
walk
into
the
manufactory
william
was
not
very
long
in
making
his
appearance
he
received
the
message
that
the
master
and
lynn
wanted
him
and
in
he
went
with
alacrity
having
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
some
conference
was
about
to
be
held
touching
the
french
journey
considerably
surprised
was
he
to
learn
what
the
matter
really
was
he
quite
laughed
at
the
idea
of
the
cheque
being
gone
and
believed
that
ashley
must
have
torn
it
up
very
minutely
went
he
over
the
contents
of
the
its
relics
were
not
there
it
like
magic
exclaimed
william
no
one
entered
the
not
even
lynn
or
cyril
dare
cyril
dare
was
with
me
said
the
quaker
verily
it
seems
to
savour
of
the
marvellous
it
certainly
did
and
no
conclusion
could
be
come
to
neither
could
anything
be
done
that
night
it
was
late
when
william
reached
home
a
quarter
past
ten
frank
was
sitting
over
the
fire
waiting
for
him
gar
had
gone
to
bed
tired
halliburton
with
headache
dobbs
because
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
how
late
you
are
was
frank
salutation
just
because
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
upon
the
old
theme
said
william
with
a
smile
oxford
or
cambridge
i
say
william
if
you
are
going
to
throw
cold
water
upon
it
but
it
wo
put
a
damper
upon
me
broke
off
frank
gaily
i
would
rather
throw
hot
water
on
it
than
cold
frank
look
here
william
i
am
growing
up
to
be
a
man
and
i
ca
bear
the
idea
of
living
longer
upon
my
mother
at
my
age
i
ought
to
be
helping
her
i
am
no
nearer
the
university
than
i
was
years
ago
and
if
i
can
not
get
there
all
my
labour
and
my
learning
will
be
thrown
away
not
thrown
away
said
william
thrown
away
as
far
as
my
views
are
concerned
i
must
go
to
the
bar
or
go
to
nothing
cæsar
aut
to
the
university
i
go
and
i
see
nothing
for
it
but
to
do
so
as
a
servitor
i
sha
care
a
fig
for
the
ridicule
of
those
who
get
there
by
a
golden
road
there
lacon
going
to
christchurch
at
easter
a
gentleman
commoner
parr
goes
to
cambridge
to
old
trinity
they
are
the
sons
of
rich
men
i
am
not
envying
them
we
have
not
faced
the
difficulties
of
our
position
so
long
and
made
the
best
of
them
for
me
to
begin
envying
others
now
wall
nephew
goes
up
at
easter
oh
does
he
interrupted
william
i
thought
he
could
not
manage
it
nor
can
he
manage
it
in
that
sense
his
father
has
too
large
a
family
to
help
him
and
there
no
chance
of
the
exhibition
it
is
promised
keating
has
announced
the
exhibitions
in
helstonleigh
college
do
go
by
right
right
or
merit
do
you
mean
frank
i
suppose
i
mean
merit
but
the
one
implies
the
other
they
go
by
neither
or
you
think
that
frank
halliburton
would
have
had
it
at
any
rate
he
has
not
got
it
neither
has
wall
therefore
we
have
made
up
our
minds
he
and
i
to
go
to
oxford
as
servitors
all
right
success
to
you
both
frank
fell
into
a
reverie
the
friend
of
whom
he
spoke
wall
was
nephew
of
the
of
the
college
school
of
course
i
never
expected
to
get
to
college
in
any
other
way
continued
frank
taking
up
the
tongs
and
balancing
them
on
his
fingers
if
an
exhibition
did
at
odd
moments
cross
my
hopes
i
would
not
dwell
upon
it
there
are
fellows
in
the
school
richer
and
greater
than
i
however
the
exhibition
is
and
there
an
end
of
it
the
question
now
is
if
i
do
go
as
a
servitor
can
my
mother
find
the
little
additional
expense
necessary
to
keep
me
there
yes
i
am
sure
she
can
and
will
replied
william
there
be
the
expenses
of
travelling
and
sundry
other
little
things
went
on
frank
wall
says
it
will
cost
each
of
us
about
fifteen
pounds
a
year
we
have
dinner
and
supper
free
of
course
i
should
never
think
of
tea
and
for
breakfast
i
would
take
milk
and
plain
bread
there
be
living
at
home
between
terms
unless
i
found
something
to
do
and
my
clothes
it
can
be
managed
frank
you
drop
those
tongs
what
we
shall
have
to
do
as
servitors
neither
i
nor
wall
can
precisely
tell
continued
frank
paying
no
attention
to
the
warning
wall
says
brushing
clothes
and
setting
tables
for
meals
and
waiting
on
the
other
students
at
dinner
will
be
amongst
the
refreshing
exercises
however
it
may
be
my
mind
is
made
up
if
they
put
me
to
black
shoes
i
shall
only
sing
over
it
and
sit
down
to
my
studies
with
a
better
will
when
the
shoes
have
come
to
an
end
william
smiled
blacking
shoes
will
be
no
new
employment
to
you
frank
no
and
if
ever
i
catch
myself
coveting
the
ease
and
dignity
of
the
lordly
hats
i
shall
just
cast
my
thoughts
back
again
to
our
early
privations
to
what
my
mother
struggled
through
for
us
and
that
will
bring
me
down
again
we
owe
all
to
her
and
i
hope
she
will
owe
something
to
us
in
the
shape
of
comforts
before
she
dies
warmly
added
frank
the
tears
rising
to
his
eyes
it
is
what
i
have
hoped
for
years
replied
william
in
a
low
tone
it
is
coming
frank
well
i
think
i
do
now
see
one
step
before
me
you
remember
dream
william
william
simply
bowed
his
head
lately
i
have
not
even
seen
that
step
between
ourselves
i
was
losing
some
of
my
hopefulness
and
you
know
that
is
what
i
never
lost
whatever
the
rest
of
you
may
have
done
we
none
of
us
lost
hope
frank
it
was
hope
that
enabled
us
to
bear
on
you
were
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
the
step
i
see
before
me
now
is
to
go
to
oxford
as
a
servitor
to
john
if
i
can
for
i
should
like
to
be
with
wall
he
is
a
good
plodding
fellow
though
i
do
know
that
he
is
with
brains
not
with
the
quick
brains
of
frank
halliburton
frank
laughed
you
know
perry
the
minor
canon
he
also
went
to
john
as
a
servitor
i
shall
get
him
to
tell
me
frank
stopped
the
tongs
had
gone
down
with
a
clatter
chapter
xvi
dare
governess
there
such
a
row
at
our
place
suddenly
announced
cyril
dare
at
the
pomeranian
knoll
one
monday
evening
what
about
asked
dare
some
money
missing
at
least
a
cheque
which
amounts
to
the
same
thing
not
quite
the
same
dissented
dare
unless
it
has
been
cashed
i
mean
the
same
as
regards
noise
continued
cyril
there
as
much
fuss
being
made
over
it
as
if
it
had
been
fourteen
pounds
weight
of
solid
gold
it
was
a
cheque
of
dunns
and
the
master
put
it
into
his
desk
or
says
he
did
so
when
he
came
to
look
for
it
it
was
gone
who
took
it
inquired
dare
who
to
know
that
what
we
want
to
find
out
what
was
the
amount
fourteen
pounds
i
say
a
paltry
sum
ashley
makes
a
boast
and
says
it
not
the
amount
that
bothers
him
but
the
feeling
that
we
must
have
some
one
false
near
us
do
speak
so
slightingly
of
money
rebuked
dare
fourteen
pounds
are
not
so
easily
picked
up
that
it
should
be
pleasant
to
lose
them
i
sure
i
do
want
to
speak
slightingly
of
money
returned
cyril
rebelliously
you
keep
me
too
short
sir
for
me
not
to
know
the
full
value
of
it
but
fourteen
pounds
can
not
be
much
of
a
loss
to
mr
ashley
if
i
keep
you
short
you
have
forced
me
to
it
by
your
extravagances
you
and
the
rest
of
you
responded
dare
in
short
emphatic
tones
an
unpleasant
pause
ensued
when
the
father
of
a
family
intimates
that
his
income
is
diminishing
it
is
not
a
welcome
announcement
the
young
dares
had
been
obliged
to
hear
it
often
lately
adelaide
broke
the
silence
how
was
the
cheque
taken
it
was
a
cheque
brought
by
dunns
people
on
saturday
night
in
exchange
for
money
and
the
master
placed
it
in
his
open
desk
in
the
explained
cyril
he
went
into
lynn
room
to
watch
the
packing
and
was
away
an
hour
when
he
returned
the
cheque
was
gone
who
was
in
the
not
a
soul
except
halliburton
he
was
there
all
the
time
and
no
one
else
went
in
cried
dare
no
one
replied
cyril
sending
up
his
plate
for
more
meat
why
then
it
would
look
as
if
halliburton
took
it
exclaimed
dare
cyril
raised
his
eyebrows
no
one
would
venture
to
suggest
as
much
in
the
hearing
of
the
manufactory
it
appears
to
be
impressed
with
the
opinion
that
halliburton
like
kings
can
do
no
wrong
ashley
is
so
ashley
and
downwards
but
cyril
if
the
facts
are
as
you
state
halliburton
must
have
been
the
one
to
take
it
objected
dare
possibly
the
cheque
may
have
been
only
mislaid
the
underwent
a
thorough
search
this
morning
and
every
corner
of
the
master
desk
was
turned
out
but
nothing
came
of
it
halliburton
appears
to
be
in
a
world
of
surprise
as
to
where
it
can
have
gone
but
he
does
not
seem
to
glance
at
the
fact
that
suspicion
may
attach
to
him
of
course
ashley
intends
to
investigate
it
officially
said
dare
he
does
not
say
replied
cyril
he
had
the
two
packers
before
him
this
morning
separately
inquiring
if
they
saw
any
one
pass
through
the
room
to
the
on
saturday
night
he
also
questioned
me
we
had
none
of
us
seen
anything
of
the
sort
where
were
you
at
the
time
cyril
eagerly
questioned
dare
knowing
what
we
know
it
may
seem
a
pointed
question
it
was
not
however
so
spoken
dare
would
probably
have
suspected
the
whole
manufactory
before
casting
suspicion
upon
his
son
the
thought
that
really
crossed
his
mind
was
that
if
his
son
happened
to
be
in
the
way
and
had
seen
the
thief
whoever
he
might
be
steal
into
the
so
that
through
him
he
might
be
discovered
it
would
have
been
a
feather
in
cyril
cap
in
the
sight
of
ashley
and
to
find
favour
with
ashley
dare
considered
ought
to
be
the
ruling
aim
of
cyril
life
i
was
away
from
it
all
as
it
happened
said
cyril
in
reply
to
the
question
old
lynn
nailed
me
on
saturday
to
help
to
pay
the
men
while
the
cheque
was
disappearing
i
was
at
the
delightful
employment
of
counting
coppers
did
one
of
the
packers
get
in
impossible
they
were
under
ashley
eye
the
whole
time
look
here
cyril
interrupted
dare
the
first
word
she
had
spoken
is
it
sure
that
that
simon
of
a
quaker
has
not
helped
himself
to
it
cyril
burst
into
a
laugh
he
is
not
a
simon
in
the
manufactory
i
can
tell
you
he
is
too
much
of
a
martinet
will
ashley
be
at
the
manufactory
this
evening
cyril
questioned
dare
you
may
as
well
ask
me
whether
the
moon
will
shine
was
the
response
of
cyril
ashley
comes
sometimes
in
an
evening
but
we
never
know
whether
he
will
or
not
beforehand
because
he
may
be
glad
of
legal
assistance
remarked
dare
who
rarely
failed
to
turn
an
eye
to
business
you
may
remember
the
party
that
formerly
sat
round
on
that
day
some
years
ago
when
herbert
was
pleased
to
fancy
that
he
fared
badly
not
appreciating
the
excellences
of
lamb
two
of
that
party
were
now
absent
from
it
julia
dare
and
miss
benyon
julia
had
married
and
had
left
england
with
her
husband
and
miss
benyon
had
been
discarded
for
a
more
fashionable
governess
this
fashionable
governess
now
sat
at
the
table
she
was
called
mademoiselle
varsini
you
must
not
mistake
her
for
a
french
woman
she
was
an
italian
she
had
been
a
great
deal
in
france
and
spoke
the
language
as
a
native
indeed
it
was
more
easy
to
her
now
than
her
childhood
tongue
and
french
was
the
language
she
was
required
to
converse
in
with
her
pupils
rosa
and
minny
dare
english
also
she
spoke
fluently
but
with
a
foreign
accent
she
was
peculiar
looking
her
complexion
was
of
pale
olive
and
her
eyes
were
light
blue
it
is
not
often
that
light
blue
eyes
are
seen
in
conjunction
with
so
dark
a
skin
strange
eyes
they
were
eyes
that
glistened
as
if
they
were
made
of
glass
they
had
at
times
a
hard
glazed
appearance
her
black
hair
was
drawn
from
her
face
and
twisted
into
innumerable
rolls
at
the
back
of
her
head
it
was
smooth
and
beautiful
as
if
a
silken
rope
had
been
coiled
there
her
lips
were
thin
and
compressed
in
a
remarkable
degree
which
may
have
been
supposed
to
indicate
firmness
of
character
tall
and
full
across
the
bust
for
her
years
her
figure
would
have
been
called
a
fine
one
she
wore
a
dress
of
some
soft
dark
material
with
small
embroidered
cuffs
and
collar
what
were
her
years
she
said
but
she
might
be
taken
for
either
older
or
younger
it
is
difficult
to
guess
with
certainty
the
age
of
an
italian
woman
as
a
rule
they
look
much
older
than
english
women
and
when
they
do
begin
to
show
age
they
show
it
rapidly
dare
had
never
approved
of
the
engagement
of
this
foreign
governess
dare
had
picked
her
up
from
an
advertisement
and
had
persisted
in
engaging
her
in
spite
of
the
written
references
being
in
french
and
that
she
could
only
read
one
word
in
ten
of
them
dare
scruples
were
solely
pecuniary
the
salary
was
to
be
fifty
pounds
a
year
exactly
double
the
amount
paid
to
miss
benyon
and
he
had
great
expenses
on
him
now
what
did
the
girls
want
with
a
fashionable
foreign
governess
he
asked
but
he
made
no
impression
upon
dare
the
lady
was
engaged
and
arrived
in
helstonleigh
and
dare
had
declared
from
that
hour
to
this
that
he
could
not
make
her
out
he
professed
to
be
a
great
reader
of
the
human
face
and
of
human
character
has
there
been
any
attempt
made
to
cash
the
cheque
resumed
dare
to
cyril
ashley
said
nothing
about
that
replied
cyril
it
was
lost
after
banking
hours
on
saturday
night
therefore
he
would
be
sure
to
stop
it
at
the
bank
before
monday
morning
it
is
ashley
loss
dunns
of
course
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
would
be
no
difficult
matter
to
change
it
in
the
town
remarked
anthony
dare
anyone
would
cash
a
cheque
of
dunns
it
is
as
good
as
a
banknote
cyril
lifted
his
shoulders
the
fellow
had
better
not
be
caught
at
it
though
what
would
be
the
punishment
in
angleterre
for
such
a
crime
spoke
up
the
governess
transportation
for
a
longer
or
a
shorter
period
replied
dare
what
you
would
phrase
mademoiselle
struck
in
herbert
ah
ça
responded
mademoiselle
as
they
called
her
mademoiselle
we
must
do
the
same
there
had
been
a
discussion
as
to
what
she
was
to
be
called
when
she
first
came
varsini
was
not
grand
enough
signora
varsini
was
not
deemed
familiar
enough
for
daily
use
therefore
mademoiselle
was
decided
upon
it
appeared
to
be
all
one
to
mademoiselle
herself
she
had
been
accustomed
she
said
to
be
called
mademoiselle
in
france
dare
hurried
over
his
dinner
and
his
wine
and
rose
he
was
going
to
find
out
ashley
he
was
in
hopes
some
professional
business
might
arise
to
him
in
the
investigation
of
the
loss
spoken
of
by
cyril
he
was
not
a
particularly
covetous
man
and
had
never
been
considered
grasping
especially
in
business
but
circumstances
were
rendering
him
so
now
his
general
expenses
were
enormous
his
sons
contrived
that
their
own
expenses
should
be
enormous
and
dare
sometimes
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
to
meet
them
anthony
drained
him
it
was
dare
own
expression
herbert
drained
him
cyril
wanted
to
drain
him
george
was
working
on
for
it
small
odds
and
ends
arising
in
a
lawyer
practice
that
years
ago
dare
would
scarcely
have
cared
to
trouble
himself
to
undertake
were
eagerly
sought
for
by
him
now
he
must
work
to
live
it
was
not
that
his
practice
was
a
bad
one
it
was
an
excellent
practice
but
do
as
dare
would
his
expenses
outran
it
he
bent
his
steps
to
the
manufactory
had
ashley
not
been
there
dare
would
have
gone
on
to
his
house
but
ashley
was
there
they
were
shut
into
the
private
room
and
ashley
gave
the
particulars
of
the
loss
more
in
detail
than
cyril
had
given
them
there
is
only
one
opinion
to
be
formed
observed
dare
young
halliburton
was
the
thief
the
cheque
could
not
go
of
itself
and
no
one
else
appears
to
have
been
near
it
in
urging
the
case
against
william
dare
was
influenced
by
no
covert
motive
he
drew
his
inferences
from
the
circumstances
related
to
him
and
spoke
in
accordance
with
them
the
resentment
he
had
once
felt
against
the
halliburtons
for
coming
to
helstonleigh
though
the
resentment
was
on
dare
part
rather
than
on
his
had
long
since
died
away
they
did
not
cross
his
path
or
he
theirs
they
did
not
presume
upon
the
relationship
had
not
so
far
as
dare
knew
made
it
known
abroad
therefore
they
were
quite
welcome
to
be
in
helstonleigh
for
dare
to
do
dare
justice
he
was
rather
kindly
disposed
towards
his
unless
carried
him
the
other
way
cyril
often
amused
himself
at
home
by
abusing
william
halliburton
they
were
tolerable
friends
and
companions
when
together
but
cyril
could
not
overcome
his
feeling
of
dislike
a
feeling
to
which
jealousy
was
now
added
for
william
found
more
favour
with
ashley
than
he
did
cyril
gave
vent
to
his
anger
in
explosions
at
home
and
william
was
not
spared
in
them
but
dare
had
learnt
what
his
son
prejudices
were
worth
it
must
have
been
halliburton
repeated
dare
no
replied
ashley
there
are
four
persons
of
all
those
who
were
in
my
manufactory
on
saturday
night
for
whom
i
will
answer
as
confidently
as
i
would
for
myself
james
meeking
and
george
dance
are
two
i
believe
them
both
to
be
honest
as
the
day
and
if
additional
confirmation
that
it
was
not
they
were
necessary
neither
of
them
stirred
from
beneath
my
own
eye
during
the
possible
time
of
the
loss
the
other
two
are
samuel
lynn
and
william
halliburton
samuel
lynn
is
above
suspicion
and
i
have
watched
william
grow
up
from
boyhood
always
upright
truthful
and
honourable
but
more
truthful
more
honourable
year
by
year
as
the
years
have
passed
i
dare
say
he
is
acquiesced
dare
indeed
i
like
his
look
myself
there
something
unusually
frank
about
it
of
course
you
will
have
it
officially
investigated
i
came
down
to
offer
you
my
services
in
the
matter
you
are
very
good
was
the
reply
of
ashley
before
entering
farther
into
the
affair
i
must
be
fully
convinced
that
the
disappearance
was
not
caused
by
myself
i
by
yourself
interrupted
dare
in
surprise
i
do
not
it
was
mind
but
there
is
a
chance
of
it
i
remember
tearing
up
a
paper
or
two
after
i
received
the
cheque
and
putting
the
pieces
as
i
believe
into
the
basket
but
i
wo
answer
for
it
that
i
did
not
put
them
into
the
fire
instead
as
i
passed
it
on
my
way
to
lynn
room
to
call
over
the
parcels
bill
but
you
would
not
tear
up
the
cheque
cried
dare
certainly
not
intentionally
if
i
did
it
through
carelessness
all
i
can
say
is
i
have
been
careless
no
i
shall
not
stir
in
this
matter
for
a
day
or
two
but
why
wait
asked
dare
if
the
cheque
was
stolen
it
was
probably
changed
somewhere
in
the
town
that
same
night
and
this
will
soon
be
known
i
shall
wait
dare
could
not
bring
ashley
to
a
more
frame
of
mind
he
left
the
manufactory
and
went
straight
to
the
there
to
hold
an
interview
with
mr
sergeant
delves
a
popular
officer
with
whom
dare
had
had
dealings
before
he
stated
the
case
to
him
and
desired
mr
delves
to
ferret
out
what
he
could
privately
you
know
delves
said
he
winking
at
the
sergeant
whom
he
held
by
the
shoulder
there
no
doubt
in
my
opinion
that
the
cheque
was
changed
that
same
night
probably
at
a
go
to
work
you
understand
and
any
information
you
may
obtain
bring
quietly
to
me
do
take
it
to
mr
ashley
i
understand
replied
sergeant
delves
a
portly
man
with
a
padded
breast
and
a
red
face
who
in
his
official
costume
always
looked
as
if
he
were
choking
i
see
to
it
and
he
did
so
and
very
effectively
chapter
xvii
taking
an
italian
lesson
but
the
evening
is
not
yet
over
at
pomeranian
knoll
the
had
broken
up
anthony
dare
left
the
house
soon
after
his
father
dare
turned
to
the
fire
for
her
nap
the
young
ladies
adelaide
excepted
proceeded
to
the
adelaide
dare
was
thinner
than
formerly
and
there
was
a
worn
restless
look
upon
her
face
that
told
of
care
or
of
disappointment
she
remained
in
her
seat
at
the
and
fencing
herself
round
with
a
newspaper
lest
dare
eyes
should
open
took
a
letter
from
her
pocket
and
spread
it
on
the
table
viscount
hawkesley
had
never
come
forward
to
make
her
the
viscountess
but
he
had
not
given
up
his
visits
to
pomeranian
knoll
and
adelaide
had
never
ceased
hoping
it
was
one
of
his
letters
that
she
was
poring
over
now
two
or
three
years
ago
she
might
have
married
well
a
clergyman
had
desired
to
make
her
his
wife
adelaide
declined
she
had
possibly
her
own
private
reasons
for
believing
in
the
good
faith
of
lord
hawkesley
adelaide
dare
was
not
the
first
who
has
thrown
away
the
substance
to
grasp
the
shadow
mademoiselle
varsini
on
leaving
the
had
gone
up
to
the
there
she
stirred
the
fire
into
a
blaze
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
bent
her
head
in
what
seemed
to
be
an
attitude
of
listening
she
did
not
listen
in
vain
soon
stealthy
footsteps
were
heard
ascending
the
stairs
and
a
streak
of
vermilion
flashed
into
her
olive
cheek
and
she
pressed
her
hand
upon
her
bosom
as
if
to
still
its
beating
je
suis
bête
she
murmured
french
was
far
more
familiar
to
her
than
her
native
tongue
the
footsteps
proved
to
be
those
of
herbert
dare
a
tall
handsome
man
now
than
anthony
he
herbert
would
have
been
very
handsome
indeed
but
that
his
features
were
spoiled
by
the
free
expression
they
had
worn
in
his
youth
free
as
that
which
characterised
the
face
of
dare
he
was
coming
in
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
governess
he
paid
her
a
good
many
visits
possibly
thought
it
polite
to
do
so
some
gentlemen
are
polite
and
some
are
the
contrary
some
take
every
opportunity
of
improving
their
minds
some
do
care
whether
they
improve
them
or
not
herbert
dare
we
should
place
amidst
the
former
a
thirst
for
foreign
languages
must
undoubtedly
be
reckoned
one
of
the
desires
for
improvement
minny
dare
had
one
evening
broken
in
upon
a
visit
her
brother
was
paying
to
mademoiselle
and
she
very
impertinently
it
must
be
owned
inquired
what
he
was
doing
there
taking
an
italian
lesson
herbert
answered
and
he
did
not
want
minny
to
bother
him
over
it
minny
made
a
wry
face
at
the
books
spread
out
between
herbert
and
mademoiselle
seated
opposite
each
other
at
either
end
of
the
table
and
withdrew
with
all
speed
lest
the
governess
should
press
her
to
share
in
it
minny
did
not
like
italian
lessons
as
much
as
herbert
appeared
to
do
he
came
in
with
quiet
footsteps
and
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
lock
the
door
the
action
may
have
been
intended
as
a
quiet
reproof
to
miss
minny
if
so
it
is
a
pity
she
was
not
there
to
profit
by
it
have
they
asked
for
me
in
the
salon
began
the
governess
not
they
replied
herbert
they
are
too
much
occupied
with
their
own
concerns
herbert
why
were
you
not
here
on
saturday
night
she
asked
on
saturday
night
oh
i
remember
i
had
to
go
out
to
keep
an
engagement
you
might
have
spoken
to
me
first
then
she
answered
resentfully
just
one
little
word
i
did
come
up
here
and
i
waited
i
waited
after
the
tea
i
came
up
and
i
waited
again
ah
quelle
patience
waited
to
give
me
my
italian
lesson
herbert
dare
spoke
in
a
voice
of
laughing
raillery
the
italian
girl
did
not
seem
inclined
to
laugh
she
stood
on
one
side
the
fire
and
its
blaze
it
was
the
only
light
in
the
room
flickered
on
her
compressed
lips
more
compressed
than
ever
were
they
now
what
the
use
of
turning
cross
bianca
continued
herbert
still
laughing
you
are
as
exacting
as
if
i
paid
you
a
guinea
a
lesson
and
went
upon
a
system
of
lesson
no
pay
if
bah
interrupted
mademoiselle
angrily
and
it
certainly
was
not
respectful
of
herbert
as
pupil
to
call
her
by
her
christian
name
if
it
was
that
which
angered
her
i
am
getting
nearly
tired
of
it
all
tired
of
me
you
might
have
a
worse
pupil
will
you
be
quiet
then
cried
she
stamping
her
foot
i
am
not
inclined
for
folly
you
shall
not
say
again
you
are
coming
here
if
you
do
come
mind
as
you
did
on
saturday
night
well
i
had
an
engagement
and
i
went
straight
off
from
the
to
keep
it
answered
herbert
becoming
serious
upon
my
word
of
honour
it
was
not
my
fault
bianca
it
was
a
business
engagement
i
had
not
time
to
come
here
before
i
went
then
you
might
have
come
when
you
returned
she
said
scarcely
replied
he
i
was
not
home
till
two
in
the
morning
bianca
varsini
lifted
her
strange
eyes
to
his
why
tell
me
that
she
asked
her
voice
changing
to
one
of
mournful
complaint
i
know
you
went
out
from
dinner
i
watched
you
out
and
i
saw
you
when
you
went
out
again
it
was
past
ten
i
saw
you
with
my
own
eyes
you
must
have
good
eyes
bianca
i
went
out
from
the
not
then
not
then
i
speak
not
of
then
she
vehemently
interrupted
you
might
have
come
here
before
you
went
out
the
second
time
i
declare
i
do
know
what
you
mean
he
said
staring
at
her
i
did
not
come
in
until
two
in
the
morning
it
was
past
two
but
i
saw
you
she
persisted
it
was
moonlight
and
i
saw
you
cross
the
lawn
from
the
window
and
go
out
i
was
at
this
window
and
i
watched
you
go
in
the
direction
of
the
gate
it
was
long
past
ten
bianca
you
were
dreaming
i
was
not
near
the
house
again
she
stamped
her
foot
you
deceive
me
would
i
say
i
saw
you
if
i
did
not
herbert
had
once
seen
bianca
varsini
in
a
passion
he
did
not
care
to
see
her
in
one
again
when
he
said
that
he
had
not
come
near
the
house
from
the
time
of
his
leaving
it
on
rising
from
dinner
until
two
in
the
morning
he
had
spoken
the
strict
truth
what
the
italian
girl
was
driving
at
he
could
not
imagine
but
he
deemed
it
as
well
to
drop
the
subject
you
are
a
folle
bianca
as
you
often
call
yourself
said
he
jestingly
taking
her
hands
you
go
into
a
temper
for
nothing
i
get
rid
of
that
haste
if
i
were
you
it
was
my
mother
temper
she
answered
drawing
her
hands
away
and
letting
them
fall
by
her
side
do
you
know
what
she
once
did
she
spit
in
the
face
of
the
archevêque
of
paris
she
was
a
lady
cried
herbert
ironically
how
was
that
he
offended
her
he
was
passing
her
in
procession
at
the
and
he
said
something
reproachful
to
her
and
it
put
her
in
a
temper
and
she
spit
at
him
she
could
do
worse
than
that
if
she
liked
she
could
have
died
for
those
who
were
kind
to
her
but
let
them
offend
her
je
les
en
fais
mes
compliments
i
say
mademoiselle
who
was
your
mother
never
you
mind
she
was
on
the
stage
not
what
you
english
call
good
but
she
was
good
to
me
and
she
wished
me
to
be
what
she
was
not
when
i
was
twelve
she
put
me
into
a
convent
la
maudite
place
herbert
laughed
he
knew
enough
of
french
to
understand
the
expression
it
was
maudite
to
me
i
must
not
dance
i
must
not
sing
i
must
not
have
my
liberty
to
do
the
simplest
thing
on
earth
i
must
be
up
in
the
morning
to
prayers
and
then
at
my
lessons
all
day
and
then
at
prayers
again
i
did
pray
i
did
pray
to
the
virgin
to
take
me
from
it
i
nearly
prayed
my
heart
out
and
she
never
heard
me
i
had
been
there
a
year
figure
to
yourself
a
year
when
my
mother
came
to
see
me
she
had
been
back
in
italy
me
away
i
said
to
her
i
die
bianca
mia
she
answered
leave
you
here
that
you
may
not
die
that
your
life
may
be
happier
than
mine
is
for
mine
is
the
vraie
misère
i
not
tell
you
in
italian
as
she
spoke
for
you
not
understand
it
rapidly
interrupted
mademoiselle
my
mother
she
continued
to
me
you
are
instructed
you
shall
become
a
gouvernante
in
a
family
of
the
noblesse
you
shall
consort
with
the
princes
without
shame
and
perhaps
you
will
make
a
good
parti
in
marriage
though
you
have
no
fortune
you
will
be
accomplished
you
will
have
the
manière
and
the
tournure
you
will
be
belle
do
you
think
me
belle
she
abruptly
broke
off
again
enchanting
answered
herbert
have
i
not
told
you
so
five
hundred
times
she
stole
a
glance
at
the
little
oval
glass
which
hung
over
the
and
then
went
on
my
mother
would
not
take
me
out
though
i
lay
on
the
flagstones
of
the
visitors
parlour
though
i
wept
for
it
she
would
not
take
me
out
is
for
your
good
bianca
mia
she
said
and
i
remained
there
seven
years
seven
years
do
you
figure
it
but
i
suppose
you
grew
reconciled
we
grow
reconciled
to
the
worst
in
time
she
answered
dreamily
gazing
into
the
fire
with
her
strange
eyes
i
pressed
down
my
despair
into
myself
at
first
and
i
looked
out
for
the
opportunity
to
run
away
we
were
as
closely
kept
as
the
nuns
in
their
cells
in
their
barred
rooms
in
their
grated
chapel
but
sooner
than
not
have
had
my
will
and
get
away
i
would
have
set
the
place
on
fire
i
say
mademoiselle
do
you
talk
treason
cried
herbert
laughing
do
you
think
i
would
not
she
answered
turning
to
him
a
gleaming
look
in
her
eyes
but
i
had
to
wait
for
the
opportunity
to
escape
and
while
i
waited
news
came
that
my
mother
had
died
she
caught
cold
one
night
when
she
was
in
her
evening
robe
and
it
settled
in
her
throat
and
formed
a
dépôt
and
she
died
and
so
it
was
all
over
with
my
escape
my
mother
gone
i
had
nowhere
to
fly
to
and
i
stopped
in
that
enfer
seven
years
you
are
complimentary
to
convents
bianca
maudite
in
one
breath
enfer
in
another
they
are
all
that
and
worse
intemperately
responded
the
italian
girl
they
are
mais
fini
pour
moi
i
had
to
beat
down
my
heart
then
and
stop
in
one
ah
i
know
not
how
i
did
it
i
look
back
and
wonder
seven
years
but
who
paid
for
you
all
that
time
my
mother
was
not
poor
she
had
enough
for
that
she
made
the
arrangements
with
a
priest
when
she
was
dying
and
paid
the
money
to
him
the
convent
educated
me
and
dressed
me
and
made
me
hard
their
cold
rules
beat
down
my
rebellious
heart
beat
it
down
to
hardness
i
should
not
have
been
so
hard
but
for
that
convent
oh
you
are
hard
then
was
the
remark
of
herbert
dare
i
can
be
nodded
mademoiselle
varsini
better
not
cross
and
how
did
you
get
out
of
the
convent
when
i
was
nineteen
they
sent
me
out
into
a
situation
to
teach
music
and
my
own
language
and
french
and
english
they
taught
well
in
the
convent
i
could
speak
english
then
as
readily
as
i
speak
it
now
and
they
gave
me
a
box
of
clothes
and
four
pieces
saying
that
was
the
last
of
my
mother
effects
what
cared
i
had
they
turned
me
out
penniless
i
should
have
jumped
to
go
i
served
in
that
first
situation
two
years
it
was
easy
and
it
was
good
pay
french
people
but
certainly
parisians
it
was
not
more
than
one
mile
from
the
convent
there
was
but
one
little
pupil
why
did
you
leave
i
was
put
into
a
passion
one
day
and
madame
said
after
that
she
was
frightened
to
keep
me
ah
i
have
had
adventures
i
can
tell
you
in
the
next
place
i
did
not
stay
three
months
the
ennui
came
to
me
and
i
left
it
for
another
that
i
found
and
the
other
one
i
liked
i
had
my
liberty
i
should
have
stayed
in
that
but
one
came
and
turned
me
out
of
it
a
fresh
governess
no
a
man
a
hideous
he
was
madame
brother
and
he
was
wrinkled
and
yellow
and
his
long
skinny
fingers
were
like
claws
he
wanted
me
to
marry
him
he
said
he
was
rich
sell
myself
to
that
monster
no
continue
a
governess
rather
one
evening
madame
and
my
two
pupils
had
gone
to
the
odéon
and
he
came
to
the
little
étude
where
i
sat
he
locked
the
door
and
said
he
would
not
unlock
it
till
i
gave
him
a
promise
to
be
his
wife
i
stormed
and
i
stormed
he
tried
to
take
my
hand
the
imbécile
he
laughed
at
me
and
said
i
was
caged
why
did
you
not
ring
the
bell
interrupted
herbert
bon
do
we
have
bells
in
every
room
in
the
old
parisian
houses
i
would
have
pulled
open
the
window
but
he
stood
against
the
fastening
laughing
still
so
i
dashed
my
hand
through
a
pane
and
the
glass
clattered
down
to
the
court
below
and
the
servants
came
out
to
look
up
can
not
undo
the
étude
door
i
called
to
them
and
break
it
open
so
that
hideous
undid
it
then
and
the
servants
got
some
water
and
bathed
my
hand
why
need
the
signora
have
put
her
hand
through
the
glass
why
not
have
opened
the
window
said
one
is
that
to
you
i
said
will
not
have
to
pay
for
it
bind
my
hand
up
they
wrapped
it
in
a
handkerchief
and
i
put
on
my
bonnet
and
cloak
and
went
out
madeleine
she
was
the
cook
and
a
good
old
soul
saw
me
where
is
the
signorina
going
so
late
as
this
she
asked
should
i
be
going
but
to
the
pharmacien
i
answered
and
i
went
my
way
we
say
chemist
in
england
observed
herbert
did
he
find
your
hand
much
damaged
i
did
not
go
there
think
you
i
made
attention
to
my
hand
i
went
to
the
what
you
call
it
cutler
shops
through
the
rue
montmartre
and
i
bought
a
stiletto
it
was
that
long
pointing
from
her
wrist
to
the
end
of
her
finger
besides
the
handle
i
showed
it
to
that
hideous
the
next
day
come
to
the
room
where
i
sit
again
i
said
to
him
you
will
see
he
told
madame
his
sister
and
she
said
i
must
leave
herbert
dare
looked
at
her
at
her
pale
face
which
had
gone
white
in
the
telling
her
glistening
stony
eyes
her
drawn
lips
you
would
not
have
dared
to
use
the
stiletto
though
he
cried
in
some
wonder
i
not
dare
you
do
not
know
me
when
i
am
roused
there
not
a
thing
i
would
not
dare
to
do
i
am
not
ruffled
at
trifles
things
that
excite
others
do
not
trouble
me
what
matter
trifles
i
say
my
mother
always
told
me
to
let
the
evil
spirit
lie
torpid
within
me
or
i
should
not
die
in
my
bed
i
say
cried
herbert
half
mockingly
what
religion
do
you
call
yourself
she
took
the
question
literally
i
am
a
catholic
or
protestant
as
is
agreeable
to
my
places
was
the
very
candid
answer
i
am
not
a
dévote
a
saint
where
the
use
of
it
that
is
why
you
generally
have
those
violent
headaches
on
sunday
said
herbert
dare
laughing
you
ought
there
was
an
interruption
rosa
dare
footsteps
were
heard
on
the
stairs
and
they
halted
at
the
door
mademoiselle
she
called
out
mademoiselle
did
not
answer
herbert
dare
flung
his
handkerchief
over
the
handle
of
the
door
in
a
manner
that
hid
the
rosa
dare
tried
the
door
found
it
fastened
and
went
off
grumbling
it
my
belief
mademoiselle
locks
herself
in
there
to
get
a
nap
after
dinner
as
mamma
does
in
the
she
was
heard
to
enter
the
and
slam
the
door
herbert
softly
opened
that
of
the
and
went
down
after
his
sister
i
say
herbert
cried
rosa
when
he
entered
have
you
seen
anything
of
mademoiselle
i
responded
herbert
do
you
think
i
keep
mademoiselle
in
my
pocket
she
goes
and
locks
herself
up
in
the
after
dinner
and
i
ca
think
what
she
does
there
or
what
she
can
be
at
retorted
rosa
at
her
devotions
perhaps
suggested
herbert
the
words
did
not
please
dare
who
had
then
joined
the
circle
herbert
i
will
not
have
mademoiselle
varsini
ridiculed
she
said
quite
sternly
she
is
a
most
efficient
instructress
for
rosa
and
minny
and
we
must
be
careful
not
to
give
her
offence
or
she
might
leave
i
sure
i
have
heard
of
foreign
women
telling
their
beads
till
persisted
herbert
those
are
roman
catholics
a
protestant
as
is
mademoiselle
varsini
dare
angry
words
were
cut
short
by
the
appearance
of
mademoiselle
varsini
herself
she
the
governess
turned
to
rosa
what
did
you
want
just
now
when
you
came
to
the
door
i
wanted
you
here
to
show
me
that
filet
stitch
answered
rosa
slight
impertinence
peeping
out
in
her
tone
and
i
do
see
why
you
should
not
answer
when
i
knock
mademoiselle
it
may
not
always
suit
me
to
answer
was
the
calm
reply
of
the
governess
my
time
is
my
own
after
dinner
and
madame
dare
will
agree
with
me
that
a
governess
should
hold
full
control
over
her
you
are
perfectly
right
mademoiselle
acquiesced
dare
mademoiselle
went
to
the
piano
and
dashed
off
a
symphony
she
was
a
brilliant
player
herbert
looking
at
his
watch
and
finding
it
later
than
he
thought
hurried
from
the
house
chapter
xviii
a
vision
in
honey
fair
the
surmise
that
the
missing
cheque
had
been
changed
into
good
money
on
the
saturday
night
proved
to
be
correct
white
the
butcher
at
the
corner
of
the
shambles
had
given
change
for
it
and
locked
up
the
cheque
in
the
had
he
paid
it
into
the
bank
on
monday
he
would
have
found
what
it
was
worth
but
he
did
not
do
so
white
was
a
fat
man
with
a
countenance
and
black
hair
sergeant
delves
proceeded
to
his
house
some
time
on
the
tuesday
i
hear
you
cashed
a
cheque
of
the
dunn
on
saturday
night
began
he
who
brought
it
to
you
ah
what
about
that
cheque
returned
the
butcher
one
of
your
men
has
been
in
here
asking
a
lot
of
questions
a
good
deal
about
it
said
the
sergeant
it
was
stolen
from
mr
ashley
stolen
from
mr
ashley
echoed
the
butcher
staring
at
sergeant
delves
stolen
out
of
his
desk
and
you
stand
a
nice
chance
white
of
losing
the
money
you
should
be
more
cautious
who
was
it
brought
it
here
a
gentleman
a
respectable
man
at
any
rate
who
says
it
stolen
i
do
replied
the
sergeant
sitting
himself
down
on
the
rather
a
damp
seat
from
its
just
having
been
washed
with
hot
water
delves
liked
to
make
himself
familiar
with
his
old
friends
in
helstonleigh
in
a
patronising
manner
it
was
only
lately
he
had
been
promoted
to
sergeant
now
let
have
the
particulars
white
i
had
just
shut
up
my
shop
all
but
the
door
when
in
come
a
gentleman
in
a
cloak
and
cap
you
oblige
the
dunn
with
change
for
a
cheque
mr
white
says
he
handing
a
cheque
to
me
sir
said
i
can
very
happy
to
oblige
would
you
like
it
in
gold
well
he
said
he
would
like
it
in
gold
and
i
gave
it
to
him
ye
said
he
have
got
it
nearer
if
i
could
for
i
troubled
to
death
with
but
people
are
shut
up
and
i
noticed
that
he
had
kept
his
white
handkerchief
up
to
his
mouth
and
nose
he
went
out
with
the
gold
and
i
put
up
the
cheque
and
that
all
i
know
about
it
delves
do
you
know
who
it
was
no
i
do
he
had
a
cap
on
with
the
ears
coming
down
his
cheeks
and
what
with
that
and
the
peak
over
his
eyes
and
the
white
handkerchief
held
up
to
his
nose
i
did
so
much
as
get
a
sight
of
his
face
the
shop
was
pretty
near
dark
too
for
the
gas
was
out
there
was
only
a
candle
at
the
pay
window
if
a
man
came
in
disguised
like
that
asking
to
have
a
cheque
changed
into
gold
it
might
have
occurred
to
some
tradesmen
there
be
something
wrong
about
it
cried
the
sergeant
i
did
know
he
was
disguised
objected
the
butcher
i
saw
it
was
a
good
cheque
of
the
dunn
and
i
never
gave
a
thought
to
anything
else
i
had
their
cheques
before
william
dunn
has
dealt
here
this
twenty
year
but
now
that
it
put
into
my
head
i
begin
to
think
he
disguised
continued
the
butcher
his
voice
was
odd
thick
and
low
and
he
spoke
as
if
he
had
plums
in
his
mouth
should
you
know
him
again
ay
that
is
if
he
came
in
dressed
as
he
was
then
i
know
the
cloak
out
of
a
hundred
it
was
one
of
them
plaid
rockelows
roquelaures
corrected
the
sergeant
something
of
that
the
collar
was
lined
with
red
with
a
little
edge
of
fur
on
it
there
a
few
such
shaped
cloaks
in
the
town
now
made
of
blue
serge
or
cloth
what
time
was
it
asked
the
sergeant
just
eleven
i
was
shutting
up
sergeant
delves
took
possession
of
the
cheque
and
proceeded
to
the
office
of
dare
a
long
conference
ensued
and
then
they
went
out
together
towards
ashley
manufactory
on
the
road
they
happened
to
meet
cyril
and
dare
drew
him
aside
do
you
happen
to
know
any
one
who
wears
an
plaid
cloak
he
asked
halliburton
wears
one
replied
cyril
the
greatest
object
of
a
thing
you
ever
saw
i
say
continued
cyril
what
old
delves
doing
with
you
not
much
carelessly
said
dare
he
has
been
looking
after
a
little
private
business
for
me
oh
is
that
all
and
cyril
feeling
reassured
tore
off
on
the
errand
he
was
bound
for
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
it
would
not
have
pleased
him
that
sergeant
delves
should
be
pressed
into
the
affair
of
the
cheque
at
least
cyril
would
have
preferred
that
the
matter
should
be
allowed
to
rest
he
executed
his
commission
one
that
he
had
been
charged
with
by
samuel
lynn
turned
back
passed
the
manufactory
and
took
his
way
to
honey
fair
on
a
little
matter
of
his
own
it
was
only
the
purchase
of
a
dog
not
to
make
a
mystery
of
it
a
dog
that
had
taken
cyril
fancy
and
for
which
he
and
the
owner
had
not
yet
been
able
to
come
to
terms
so
he
was
going
up
again
to
try
his
powers
of
persuasion
as
he
walked
rapidly
through
honey
fair
he
saw
a
little
bit
of
on
the
opposite
side
a
young
woman
in
a
tattered
gown
and
a
dirty
bonnet
drawn
over
her
face
was
walking
along
as
rapidly
as
he
her
bent
head
her
humble
attitude
her
shrinking
air
her
haste
to
get
out
of
sight
of
others
all
betrayed
that
she
from
some
cause
or
other
was
not
in
good
odour
with
the
world
around
that
she
felt
herself
under
a
cloud
was
only
too
apparent
it
was
a
cloud
of
humiliation
for
which
she
had
only
herself
to
thank
the
women
who
met
her
hurried
past
with
a
toss
of
the
head
and
then
stood
to
peep
after
her
as
she
disappeared
in
the
distance
hurried
hurried
past
them
glad
it
seemed
to
be
away
from
their
stern
looks
and
condemning
eyes
had
you
seen
her
you
would
never
have
recognised
her
in
the
dim
eye
darker
than
of
yore
the
white
cheek
the
wasted
form
no
likeness
remained
of
the
caroline
mason
just
as
she
passed
opposite
to
cyril
eliza
tyrrett
came
out
of
a
house
and
met
her
and
eliza
picking
up
her
skirts
lest
they
should
become
contaminated
swept
past
with
a
sidelong
glance
of
reproach
and
a
scornful
gesture
caroline
head
only
bent
the
lower
as
she
glided
away
from
her
old
companion
it
had
been
just
as
well
that
charlotte
east
had
not
sent
back
that
bundle
years
ago
to
surprise
anthony
dare
it
was
years
now
since
charlotte
herself
had
come
to
the
same
conclusion
chapter
xix
the
duplicate
cloaks
leaning
back
against
the
corner
of
the
by
the
side
of
the
blazing
fire
in
his
private
room
calmly
surveying
those
ranged
before
him
and
listening
to
their
tale
with
an
impassive
face
was
thomas
ashley
sergeant
delves
and
dare
were
giving
him
the
account
of
the
changing
of
the
cheque
obtained
from
white
the
butcher
samuel
lynn
stood
near
the
master
desk
his
brow
knit
in
perplexity
his
countenance
keen
and
anxious
the
description
of
the
cloak
tallying
so
exactly
with
the
one
worn
by
william
halliburton
led
dare
to
the
conclusion
nay
to
the
positive
conviction
that
the
butcher
visitor
could
have
been
no
other
than
william
the
sergeant
held
the
same
view
but
the
sergeant
adopted
it
with
difficulty
it
an
odd
thing
for
to
turn
thief
said
he
reflectively
have
trusted
that
young
fellow
sir
with
untold
gold
he
added
to
ashley
here
another
proof
how
we
may
be
deceived
i
told
you
said
dare
turning
to
ashley
that
it
could
be
no
other
than
halliburton
thee
will
permit
me
to
say
friend
dare
that
i
do
not
agree
with
thy
deductions
interposed
the
quaker
before
ashley
could
answer
why
what
would
you
have
returned
dare
nothing
can
be
plainer
ask
sergeant
delves
if
he
thinks
further
proof
can
be
needed
many
a
man
has
been
hanged
upon
less
was
the
oracular
answer
of
sergeant
delves
what
part
of
my
deductions
do
you
object
to
inquired
dare
of
the
quaker
thee
art
assuming
if
i
understand
thee
correctly
that
there
is
no
other
cloak
in
the
city
so
similar
to
william
as
to
be
mistaken
for
it
just
so
then
friend
i
tell
thee
that
there
is
dare
opened
his
eyes
who
wears
it
he
asked
that
is
another
question
said
samuel
lynn
i
should
be
glad
to
find
out
myself
for
curiosity
sake
then
lynn
told
the
story
of
his
having
observed
a
man
whom
he
had
taken
for
william
walking
at
the
back
of
his
house
apparently
waiting
for
something
i
saw
him
on
two
evenings
he
observed
at
some
considerable
interval
of
time
the
figure
bore
a
perfect
resemblance
to
william
halliburton
the
height
the
cloak
the
cap
all
appeared
to
be
his
i
taxed
him
with
it
he
denied
it
said
he
had
not
been
walking
there
at
all
and
i
believed
he
was
attempting
for
the
first
time
since
i
have
known
him
to
deceive
me
i
are
you
sure
he
was
not
put
in
dare
thee
should
allow
me
to
finish
friend
last
night
i
was
home
somewhat
earlier
than
usual
thee
can
recollect
why
the
quaker
added
looking
at
ashley
i
was
up
in
my
room
and
i
saw
the
same
figure
pacing
about
in
precisely
the
same
manner
william
denial
had
staggered
me
otherwise
i
could
have
been
ready
to
affirm
that
it
was
himself
and
no
other
the
moon
was
not
up
but
it
was
a
very
light
night
and
i
marked
every
point
in
the
cloak
it
was
as
like
william
as
two
peas
are
like
each
other
what
he
could
want
pacing
at
the
back
of
my
house
and
of
his
puzzled
me
much
i
what
time
was
this
mr
lynn
interrupted
the
sergeant
past
eight
later
than
the
hour
at
which
i
had
seen
him
on
the
two
previous
occasions
is
william
halliburton
of
a
surety
i
said
to
myself
and
i
thought
i
would
pounce
upon
him
and
so
convict
him
of
the
falsehood
he
had
told
i
left
my
house
by
the
front
door
went
down
the
road
past
the
houses
and
entered
the
gate
admitting
into
the
field
i
walked
up
quietly
keeping
under
the
hedge
as
much
as
possible
and
approached
william
as
i
deemed
him
to
be
he
was
then
standing
still
and
gazing
at
the
upper
windows
of
my
house
in
spite
of
my
caution
he
heard
me
and
turned
round
whether
he
knew
me
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
he
clipped
the
cloak
around
him
with
a
hasty
movement
and
made
off
right
across
the
field
i
would
not
be
balked
if
i
could
help
it
i
opened
friend
jane
halliburton
back
gate
and
proceeded
through
the
garden
and
house
to
the
parlour
which
i
entered
without
ceremony
there
sat
william
at
his
books
then
it
was
not
he
after
all
cried
dare
interested
in
the
tale
of
a
surety
it
was
not
he
i
tell
thee
friend
he
was
seated
quietly
at
his
studies
thee
lent
thy
cloak
to
a
friend
i
asked
him
he
looked
surprised
and
said
he
had
not
but
to
be
convinced
i
requested
to
see
his
cloak
and
he
took
me
outside
the
door
and
there
was
the
cloak
hanging
up
in
the
passage
his
cap
beside
it
that
is
why
i
did
not
approve
of
thy
deductions
friend
anthony
dare
in
assuming
that
the
cloak
which
the
man
had
on
who
changed
the
cheque
must
be
william
halliburton
concluded
lynn
you
say
the
man
looked
like
william
when
you
were
close
to
him
inquired
ashley
who
thought
the
whole
affair
very
curious
and
now
broke
silence
for
the
first
time
very
much
like
him
answered
samuel
lynn
but
the
resemblance
may
have
been
only
in
the
cloak
and
cap
the
face
was
not
discernible
by
accident
or
design
it
was
concealed
i
think
there
need
not
be
better
negative
proof
that
it
was
not
william
who
changed
the
cheque
ashley
smiled
without
this
evidence
of
lynn
i
could
have
told
you
it
was
waste
of
time
to
cast
suspicion
on
william
halliburton
to
me
said
he
addressing
the
sergeant
and
dare
were
you
to
come
here
and
accuse
myself
it
would
make
just
as
much
impression
upon
me
wait
an
instant
gentlemen
he
went
to
the
door
opened
it
and
called
william
the
latter
came
in
erect
courteous
noble
never
suspecting
the
sergeant
business
there
could
have
anything
to
do
with
him
william
began
his
master
who
is
it
that
wears
a
similar
cloak
to
yours
in
the
town
i
am
unable
to
say
sir
was
william
ready
reply
until
last
night
and
he
turned
to
samuel
lynn
with
a
smile
i
should
have
said
there
was
not
another
like
it
i
suppose
now
there
must
be
one
if
there
is
one
there
may
be
more
remarked
ashley
the
fact
is
william
the
cheque
has
been
traced
it
was
changed
at
white
the
butcher
and
the
person
changing
it
wore
a
cloak
it
seems
very
much
like
yours
indeed
cried
william
with
animation
well
sir
of
course
there
may
be
many
such
cloaks
in
the
town
all
i
can
say
is
i
have
not
seen
them
there
ca
be
many
spoke
up
the
sergeant
if
it
be
the
sort
of
thing
described
to
me
william
looked
the
sergeant
full
in
the
face
with
his
open
countenance
his
honest
eyes
no
guilt
there
would
you
like
to
see
my
cloak
he
asked
it
may
be
a
guide
if
you
think
the
one
worn
resembled
it
the
sergeant
nodded
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
bring
it
in
if
it
was
here
william
brought
it
in
it
is
one
of
the
bygones
said
he
laughing
i
have
some
thoughts
of
forwarding
it
to
the
british
museum
as
a
specimen
of
antiquity
stay
i
will
put
it
on
that
you
may
see
its
beauties
the
better
he
threw
the
cloak
over
his
shoulders
and
exhibited
himself
off
as
he
had
done
once
before
in
that
for
the
benefit
of
samuel
lynn
i
think
the
british
museum
will
get
it
he
continued
in
the
same
joking
spirit
not
until
winter
over
though
it
is
a
good
friend
on
a
cold
night
sergeant
delves
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
cloak
where
have
i
seen
that
cloak
he
mused
in
a
dreamy
tone
lately
too
you
may
have
seen
me
in
it
said
william
the
sergeant
shook
his
head
he
lifted
one
hand
to
his
temples
and
proceeded
to
rub
them
gently
as
if
the
process
would
assist
his
memory
never
once
relaxing
his
gaze
did
white
say
the
changer
of
the
cheque
was
a
tall
man
asked
ashley
yes
said
dare
whether
he
meant
as
tall
as
william
halliburton
i
can
not
say
there
are
not
why
i
should
think
there
are
not
a
hundred
men
in
the
town
who
come
up
to
that
height
he
added
looking
at
william
yourself
one
of
them
said
william
turning
to
him
with
a
smile
dare
shook
his
head
a
regret
for
his
past
youth
crossing
his
heart
ay
once
i
am
beginning
to
grow
downward
now
ashley
was
buried
in
reflection
there
was
a
curious
sound
of
mystery
about
the
tale
altogether
to
his
ears
that
there
were
many
thieves
in
helstonleigh
he
did
not
doubt
people
who
would
appropriate
a
cheque
or
anything
else
that
came
in
their
way
but
why
the
same
person
if
it
was
the
same
should
pace
the
cold
field
at
night
watching
samuel
lynn
house
was
inexplicable
it
may
not
be
the
same
he
observed
aloud
shall
you
watch
for
the
man
again
he
asked
of
lynn
i
shall
not
give
myself
much
trouble
over
it
now
was
the
reply
while
i
was
concerned
to
ascertain
william
truthfulness
i
scarcely
think
you
need
have
doubted
it
lynn
interrupted
william
true
i
have
never
doubted
thee
yet
but
it
appeared
to
be
thy
word
against
the
sight
of
my
own
eyes
the
master
will
understand
a
most
extraordinary
interruption
came
from
sergeant
delves
he
threw
up
his
head
with
a
start
and
gave
vent
to
a
shrill
prolonged
whistle
it
looks
dark
cried
he
what
didst
thee
say
friend
delves
i
beg
pardon
gentlemen
answered
the
sergeant
i
was
not
speaking
to
any
of
you
i
was
following
up
the
bent
of
mine
own
thoughts
it
suddenly
flashed
into
my
mind
who
it
is
that
i
have
seen
in
one
of
these
cloaks
and
who
is
it
asked
dare
you
must
excuse
me
sir
if
i
keep
that
to
myself
was
the
answer
as
tall
a
man
as
william
halliburton
the
sergeant
ran
his
eyes
up
and
down
william
figure
a
shade
taller
i
should
say
if
anything
and
it
struck
me
that
the
man
who
made
off
across
the
field
was
a
shade
taller
observed
samuel
lynn
well
i
ca
make
sense
of
it
resumed
dare
breaking
a
pause
let
us
allow
if
you
like
that
there
are
fifty
such
cloaks
in
the
town
unless
one
wearing
such
had
access
to
to
this
very
room
that
we
are
now
in
how
does
the
fact
of
there
being
others
remove
the
suspicion
from
william
halliburton
dare
had
not
intended
wilfully
to
cause
him
pain
he
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
that
william
was
a
stranger
to
the
doubt
raised
touching
himself
amidst
the
deep
silence
that
ensued
william
looked
from
one
to
the
other
who
suspects
me
he
asked
surprise
the
only
emotion
in
his
tone
sergeant
delves
tapped
him
significantly
on
the
shoulder
never
you
trouble
yourself
young
sir
if
what
has
come
into
my
mind
be
right
it
is
who
are
guilty
when
he
and
dare
went
out
ashley
followed
them
to
the
outer
gate
as
they
stood
there
talking
frank
halliburton
passed
look
here
thought
the
sergeant
to
himself
there
not
much
doubt
as
to
the
black
sheep
i
see
that
but
it
as
well
to
be
on
the
sure
side
young
man
cried
he
aloud
to
frank
in
the
authoritative
patronizing
manner
which
sergeant
delves
was
fond
of
assuming
when
he
could
what
time
did
your
brother
william
get
home
last
saturday
night
i
suppose
you
know
if
you
were
at
home
yourself
frank
looked
at
him
rather
haughtily
know
he
replied
i
have
yet
to
learn
why
you
need
know
tell
him
frank
said
ashley
with
a
smile
it
was
a
little
after
ten
said
frank
did
he
go
out
again
asked
the
sergeant
out
again
at
that
time
cried
frank
no
he
did
not
go
out
again
we
sat
talking
together
ever
so
long
and
then
went
up
to
bed
ah
rejoined
the
sergeant
it
was
all
he
answered
and
he
wished
ashley
good
day
and
departed
with
dare
i
am
going
to
oxford
at
easter
ashley
cried
frank
with
animation
i
am
pleased
to
hear
it
but
only
as
a
servitor
i
do
mind
he
added
throwing
back
his
head
with
pardonable
pride
let
me
once
get
a
start
and
i
hope
to
rise
above
some
who
go
there
as
i
intend
to
make
this
my
circuit
he
went
on
half
jokingly
half
seriously
you
are
ambitious
frank
i
heartily
wish
you
success
there
nothing
like
keeping
a
good
heart
oh
yes
success
is
not
doubtful
i
do
battle
with
all
the
obstructions
in
my
course
good
afternoon
sir
william
curious
and
anxious
could
make
nothing
of
his
books
that
night
at
home
at
length
he
threw
up
put
on
the
notable
cloak
and
went
down
to
the
manufactory
he
found
ashley
there
and
the
soon
received
an
addition
to
its
company
in
the
person
of
sergeant
delves
he
had
come
in
search
of
william
not
being
aware
that
william
was
allowed
the
privilege
of
spending
his
evenings
at
home
he
had
supposed
the
manufactory
was
the
place
to
find
him
in
i
want
you
down
at
white
said
the
sergeant
put
on
your
cloak
will
you
be
so
good
halliburton
and
come
with
me
do
you
suspect
me
was
william
answer
no
i
do
returned
the
sergeant
i
told
you
before
that
i
did
not
the
fact
is
dropping
his
voice
to
a
mysterious
whisper
i
want
to
do
a
little
bit
of
private
inquiry
on
my
own
account
i
have
a
clue
to
the
party
and
i
should
like
to
work
it
out
if
you
have
a
sufficient
clue
the
party
had
better
be
arrested
at
once
observed
ashley
ah
but
it
not
sufficient
for
that
nodded
the
sergeant
no
ashley
sir
my
strong
advice
to
you
is
keep
quiet
a
bit
they
started
for
the
butcher
william
wearing
his
cloak
and
cap
and
ashley
accompanying
them
ashley
possessed
his
own
curiosity
upon
various
points
perhaps
his
own
doubts
it
is
strange
who
this
man
can
be
who
walks
at
the
back
of
your
house
observed
ashley
to
william
as
they
went
along
what
can
be
his
motive
for
walking
there
dressed
like
you
it
is
curious
sir
i
should
suppose
it
can
only
arise
from
a
desire
that
he
should
be
taken
for
you
continued
ashley
but
to
what
end
why
should
he
walk
there
at
all
why
indeed
responded
william
what
coloured
gloves
are
you
wearing
abruptly
interrupted
sergeant
delves
william
took
his
hands
from
beneath
his
cloak
and
held
them
out
they
were
of
the
darkest
possible
colour
next
to
black
the
shade
called
in
the
glove
trade
corbeau
these
are
all
i
have
in
use
at
present
he
said
they
are
nearly
new
have
you
worn
any
light
gloves
lately
tan
or
fawn
i
scarcely
ever
wear
tan
gloves
i
have
not
put
on
a
pair
for
months
they
arrived
at
the
butcher
and
entered
white
was
standing
at
his
block
chopping
a
bone
in
two
he
lifted
his
head
and
touched
his
hair
to
ashley
is
this
the
gentleman
who
had
the
money
of
you
for
the
cheque
began
sergeant
delves
without
circumlocution
white
put
down
his
chopper
and
took
a
survey
of
william
it
like
the
cloak
and
cap
that
the
other
wore
said
he
sergeants
take
up
words
quickly
that
the
wore
then
you
do
not
think
it
was
this
one
no
i
do
decided
the
butcher
the
one
who
brought
the
cheque
was
a
shorter
man
shorter
repeated
ashley
remembering
it
had
been
said
in
his
that
the
man
who
appeared
to
be
personating
william
was
thought
to
have
the
advantage
the
other
way
you
mean
taller
white
no
sir
i
mean
shorter
i
am
sure
he
was
shorter
not
much
though
there
was
a
pause
you
observed
that
his
gloves
were
tan
i
think
said
the
sergeant
something
of
that
sort
clean
light
gloves
they
were
such
as
gentlemen
wear
finally
then
white
you
decide
that
this
was
not
the
gentleman
not
he
said
the
butcher
it
not
the
same
voice
the
voice
goes
for
nothing
said
sergeant
delves
the
other
one
had
plums
in
his
mouth
well
said
the
butcher
i
think
i
should
have
known
halliburton
in
spite
of
any
disguise
had
he
come
in
do
make
too
sure
white
said
the
sergeant
with
one
of
his
wise
nods
he
who
came
might
have
turned
out
to
be
just
as
familiar
to
you
as
halliburton
if
he
had
let
you
see
his
face
the
fact
is
white
there
some
one
going
about
with
a
cloak
like
this
and
we
want
to
find
out
who
it
is
halliburton
would
give
a
pound
out
of
his
pocket
sure
to
know
i
give
two
said
ashley
with
a
smile
sir
asked
the
butcher
of
ashley
what
about
the
money
shall
i
lose
it
now
white
just
wait
a
bit
put
in
the
sergeant
if
it
was
a
gentleman
that
changed
it
perhaps
we
shall
get
it
out
of
any
way
you
keep
quiet
they
left
the
shop
standing
a
moment
together
before
parting
the
sergeant
road
lay
one
way
ashley
and
william
another
this
only
makes
the
matter
more
obscure
observed
ashley
alluding
to
what
had
passed
not
at
all
it
makes
it
all
the
more
clear
was
the
cool
reply
of
the
sergeant
white
says
the
man
was
shorter
than
mr
halliburton
it
just
what
i
expected
him
to
say
nodded
the
sergeant
if
i
am
on
the
right
scent
and
i
lay
a
thousand
pound
on
it
the
man
who
changed
the
cheque
shorter
i
just
wanted
white
evidence
on
the
point
he
added
looking
at
william
and
that
is
why
i
asked
you
to
come
down
dressed
in
your
cloak
good
night
gentlemen
he
turned
up
the
shambles
and
ashley
and
william
walked
away
side
by
side
chapter
xx
in
the
starlight
the
conversation
at
dare
again
turned
upon
the
loss
of
the
cheque
and
the
proceedings
thereon
it
was
natural
that
it
should
turn
upon
it
dare
mind
was
full
of
it
and
he
gave
utterance
to
various
conjectures
and
speculations
as
they
occurred
to
him
in
spite
of
what
they
say
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
it
must
have
been
william
halliburton
he
remarked
with
emphasis
he
alone
was
in
the
when
the
cheque
disappeared
and
the
person
changing
it
at
white
is
proved
to
have
borne
the
strongest
possible
resemblance
to
him
at
all
events
to
his
dress
the
face
was
hidden
as
of
course
it
would
be
people
who
attempt
to
pass
off
stolen
cheques
take
pretty
good
care
that
their
features
are
not
seen
but
who
hesitates
to
bring
it
home
to
halliburton
inquired
dare
they
all
do
as
it
seems
to
me
ashley
wo
hear
a
word
laughs
at
the
idea
of
halliburton
being
capable
of
it
and
says
we
may
as
well
accuse
himself
that
nothing
as
cyril
says
ashley
appears
to
be
imbued
with
the
idea
that
halliburton
can
do
no
wrong
but
now
delves
has
veered
round
he
shifts
the
blame
entirely
off
halliburton
upon
whom
does
he
shift
it
asked
anthony
dare
he
wo
say
replied
dare
he
has
grown
mysterious
over
it
since
the
afternoon
nodding
and
winking
and
giving
no
explanation
he
says
he
knows
who
it
is
who
possesses
the
second
cloak
the
second
cloak
the
words
were
a
puzzle
to
most
at
table
and
dare
had
to
explain
that
another
cloak
similar
to
that
worn
by
william
halliburton
was
supposed
to
be
in
existence
cyril
looked
up
with
wonder
marked
on
his
face
does
delves
say
there
are
two
such
cloaks
asked
he
that
there
are
two
such
cloaks
appears
to
be
an
indisputable
fact
replied
dare
the
one
cloak
was
parading
behind
the
house
last
night
samuel
lynn
went
up
to
it
the
cloak
parading
tout
seul
alone
interrupted
signora
varsini
with
a
perplexed
air
a
laugh
went
round
the
table
accompanied
by
the
wearer
mademoiselle
said
dare
continuing
the
account
of
samuel
lynn
adventure
thus
the
fact
of
there
being
two
cloaks
is
established
he
proceeded
still
that
tells
nothing
unless
the
owner
of
the
other
has
access
to
ashley
i
pointed
this
fact
out
to
them
but
delves
which
is
most
unaccountable
differed
from
me
and
when
we
parted
he
expressed
an
opinion
with
that
confident
nod
of
his
that
it
was
not
halliburton
cloak
which
had
been
in
the
mischief
at
the
butcher
but
the
other
what
a
thundering
falsehood
burst
forth
herbert
dare
cried
dare
while
all
around
the
table
stared
at
excited
manner
herbert
had
the
grace
to
feel
ashamed
of
his
abrupt
and
intemperate
rudeness
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
spoke
in
my
surprise
i
mean
that
delves
must
be
telling
a
falsehood
if
he
seeks
to
throw
the
guilt
off
halliburton
the
very
fact
of
the
fellow
wearing
a
strange
cloak
such
as
that
when
he
went
to
get
rid
of
the
cheque
must
be
proof
positive
of
halliburton
guilt
so
i
think
acquiesced
dare
what
sort
of
a
cloak
is
this
that
you
laugh
at
and
call
scarce
inquired
the
governess
the
greatest
scarecrow
of
a
thing
you
can
conceive
mademoiselle
responded
dare
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
it
on
halliburton
it
is
a
dark
scotch
plaid
made
very
full
with
a
turned
up
collar
lined
with
red
and
a
bit
of
fur
edging
it
plaid
plaid
repeated
mademoiselle
why
it
must
be
what
asked
dare
for
she
had
stopped
it
must
be
very
ugly
concluded
she
but
somehow
dare
gathered
an
impression
that
it
was
not
what
she
had
been
about
to
say
what
is
it
that
delves
says
about
the
cloaks
eagerly
questioned
cyril
i
can
not
make
it
out
delves
says
he
knows
who
it
is
that
owns
the
other
and
that
it
was
the
other
which
went
to
change
the
cheque
at
white
what
mysterious
words
papa
cried
adelaide
the
cloak
went
to
change
the
cheque
they
were
delves
own
words
replied
dare
he
did
seem
remarkably
mysterious
over
it
is
he
going
to
hunt
up
the
other
cloak
resumed
cyril
i
conclude
so
he
was
pondering
over
it
for
some
time
before
he
could
remember
who
it
was
that
he
had
seen
wear
a
similar
cloak
when
the
recollection
came
to
him
he
started
up
with
surprise
sharp
men
these
added
dare
they
forget
nothing
and
they
ferret
out
everything
said
herbert
with
some
testiness
instead
of
wasting
time
over
vain
speculations
touching
cloaks
why
does
not
he
secure
halliburton
it
is
impossible
that
the
other
cloak
if
there
is
another
could
have
had
anything
to
do
with
the
affair
i
dropped
a
note
to
delves
after
he
left
me
recommending
him
to
follow
up
the
suspicion
on
halliburton
whether
ashley
is
agreeable
or
not
said
dare
i
have
rarely
in
my
life
met
with
a
stronger
case
of
presumptive
evidence
so
many
besides
dare
would
have
felt
inclined
to
say
herbert
like
his
father
was
firm
in
the
belief
that
william
halliburton
must
have
taken
the
money
that
it
must
have
been
he
who
paid
the
visit
to
the
butcher
what
cyril
thought
may
be
best
inferred
from
his
actions
a
sudden
fear
had
come
over
him
that
sergeant
delves
was
really
going
to
search
out
the
other
cloak
a
most
inconvenient
procedure
for
cyril
lest
in
the
process
the
sergeant
should
search
out
he
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
he
had
had
quite
enough
dinner
for
one
day
are
you
not
hungry
cyril
asked
his
mother
i
had
a
tremendous
lunch
answered
cyril
i
ca
eat
more
now
he
sat
at
the
table
until
they
had
finished
feeling
that
he
was
being
choked
with
dread
but
that
a
guilty
conscience
deprives
us
of
free
action
he
would
have
left
the
table
and
gone
about
some
work
he
was
now
eager
to
do
he
rose
when
the
rest
did
looked
about
for
a
pair
of
large
scissors
and
glided
with
them
up
the
staircase
his
eyes
and
ears
on
the
alert
lest
there
should
be
any
watching
him
no
human
being
in
that
house
had
the
slightest
knowledge
of
what
cyril
was
about
to
do
or
that
he
was
going
to
do
anything
but
to
cyril
guilty
conscience
it
seemed
that
all
must
be
on
the
a
candle
and
scissors
in
hand
he
stole
up
to
herbert
room
and
locked
himself
in
inside
a
closet
within
the
room
hung
a
dark
blue
camlet
cloak
and
cyril
took
it
from
the
hook
it
had
a
plaid
lining
a
lining
of
the
precise
pattern
and
colours
that
the
material
of
william
halliburton
cloak
was
composed
of
the
cloak
was
of
the
same
full
make
its
collar
was
lined
with
red
tipped
with
fur
in
short
the
one
cloak
worn
on
the
right
side
and
the
other
worn
on
the
wrong
side
could
not
have
been
told
apart
this
cloak
belonged
to
herbert
dare
occasionally
though
not
often
he
went
out
at
dusk
wearing
it
wrong
side
outermost
it
was
he
no
doubt
whom
sergeant
delves
had
seen
wearing
one
he
was
a
little
taller
than
william
halliburton
towering
above
six
feet
what
his
motive
had
been
in
causing
a
cloak
to
be
lined
so
that
turned
it
should
resemble
william
halliburton
or
whether
the
similarity
in
the
lining
had
been
accidental
was
only
known
to
herbert
himself
with
trembling
fingers
and
sharp
scissors
that
were
not
particular
where
they
cut
cyril
began
his
task
of
taking
out
this
plaid
lining
that
he
had
worn
it
to
the
butcher
and
that
he
feared
it
might
tell
tales
of
him
were
facts
only
too
apparent
better
put
it
out
of
the
way
for
ever
unpicking
cutting
snipping
cyril
tore
away
at
the
lining
and
at
length
got
it
out
the
cloak
suffering
considerable
damage
in
the
shape
of
cuts
and
rents
and
loose
threads
hanging
the
cloak
up
again
he
twisted
the
lining
together
he
was
thus
engaged
when
the
handle
of
the
door
was
briskly
turned
as
if
some
one
essayed
to
enter
who
had
not
expected
to
find
it
fastened
cyril
dashed
the
lining
under
the
bed
and
made
a
spring
to
the
window
to
leap
out
surely
not
for
the
fall
would
have
killed
him
but
he
had
nearly
lost
all
presence
of
mind
in
his
perplexity
and
fear
another
turn
at
the
handle
and
the
steps
went
on
their
way
cyril
thought
he
recognized
them
for
the
housemaid
betsy
he
supposed
she
was
going
her
evening
round
of
the
chambers
gathering
the
lining
under
his
arm
he
halted
to
think
his
hands
shook
and
his
face
was
white
what
should
he
do
with
this
thing
he
could
not
eat
it
he
dared
not
burn
it
there
was
no
room
of
those
which
had
fires
where
he
might
make
sure
of
being
alone
and
the
smell
would
alarm
the
house
what
he
to
do
with
it
dig
a
hole
and
bury
it
came
a
prompting
voice
within
him
and
cyril
waited
for
no
better
suggestion
but
crept
with
it
down
the
stairs
and
out
to
the
garden
seizing
a
spade
he
dug
a
hole
rapidly
in
an
unfrequented
place
and
when
it
was
large
enough
thrust
the
stuff
in
then
he
covered
it
over
again
to
leave
the
spot
apparently
as
he
found
it
i
wish
those
stars
would
give
a
stronger
light
grumbled
cyril
looking
up
at
the
dark
blue
canopy
i
must
come
again
in
the
morning
i
suppose
and
see
that
it
all
safe
it
would
do
to
bring
a
lantern
now
it
happened
that
herbert
dare
was
bound
on
a
private
errand
that
evening
his
intention
was
to
go
abroad
in
his
cloak
while
he
executed
it
just
about
the
time
that
cyril
was
putting
the
finishing
touch
to
the
hole
herbert
went
up
to
his
room
to
get
the
cloak
to
get
the
cloak
indeed
when
herbert
opened
the
nothing
except
the
mutilated
object
just
described
met
his
eye
a
torn
cut
thing
the
threads
hanging
from
it
loosely
nothing
could
exceed
herbert
consternation
as
he
stared
at
it
he
thought
he
must
be
in
a
dream
it
his
cloak
just
before
dinner
when
he
came
up
to
wash
his
hands
he
had
seen
his
cloak
hanging
there
perfect
he
shook
it
he
pulled
it
he
peered
at
it
his
cloak
it
certainly
was
but
who
had
destroyed
it
a
suspicion
flashed
into
his
mind
that
it
might
be
the
governess
he
made
but
a
few
steps
to
the
carrying
the
cloak
with
him
the
governess
was
sitting
there
listlessly
enough
perhaps
she
was
waiting
for
him
i
say
mademoiselle
he
began
what
on
earth
have
you
been
doing
to
my
cloak
to
your
cloak
responded
she
what
should
i
have
been
doing
to
it
look
here
he
said
spreading
it
out
before
her
who
or
what
has
done
this
it
was
all
right
when
i
went
down
to
dinner
she
stared
at
it
in
astonishment
great
as
herbert
and
threw
off
a
volley
of
surprise
in
her
foreign
tongue
but
she
was
a
shrewd
woman
ay
never
was
there
a
shrewder
than
bianca
varsini
mr
sergeant
delves
was
not
a
bad
hand
at
ferreting
out
conclusions
but
she
would
have
beaten
the
sergeant
hollow
tenez
cried
she
putting
up
her
forefinger
in
thought
as
she
gazed
at
the
cloak
cyril
did
this
cyril
she
nodded
her
head
you
stood
it
out
to
me
that
you
did
not
come
in
on
saturday
evening
and
go
out
again
between
ten
and
eleven
i
did
not
interrupted
herbert
i
told
you
truth
but
you
would
not
believe
me
but
this
cloak
went
out
and
it
was
turned
the
plaid
side
outwards
and
your
cap
was
on
tied
down
at
the
ears
naturally
i
thought
it
was
you
it
must
have
been
cyril
do
you
comprehend
no
i
do
said
herbert
how
mysteriously
you
are
speaking
it
must
have
been
cyril
who
robbed
mr
ashley
mademoiselle
interrupted
herbert
indignantly
ecoutez
mon
ami
he
was
blanched
as
white
as
a
mouchoir
while
your
father
spoke
of
it
at
dinner
did
you
see
that
he
could
not
eat
look
guilty
monsieur
cyril
i
said
to
myself
not
really
thinking
him
to
be
so
but
be
persuaded
it
was
no
other
he
must
have
taken
the
or
what
you
call
it
and
come
home
here
for
your
cloak
and
cap
to
wear
while
he
changed
it
for
gold
thinking
it
would
fall
on
that
other
one
who
wears
the
cloak
that
william
hall
i
can
not
say
the
name
trop
dur
pour
les
lèvres
it
is
cyril
and
no
other
he
has
turned
afraid
now
and
has
torn
the
lining
out
herbert
could
make
no
rejoinder
at
first
partly
in
dismay
partly
in
astonishment
it
can
not
have
been
cyril
he
reiterated
i
say
it
is
cyril
persisted
the
young
lady
i
saw
him
creep
up
the
stairs
after
dinner
with
a
candle
and
your
mother
great
scissors
in
his
hand
he
did
not
see
me
i
was
in
the
dark
looking
out
of
my
room
depend
he
was
going
to
do
it
then
then
of
all
blind
idiots
cyril
the
worst
if
he
did
take
the
cheque
uttered
herbert
should
it
become
known
he
is
done
for
and
that
for
life
and
my
father
helping
to
fan
the
flame
the
governess
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
not
like
cyril
she
said
i
have
never
liked
him
since
i
came
but
you
will
not
tell
against
him
cried
herbert
in
fear
no
no
no
tell
against
your
brother
why
should
i
it
is
no
concern
of
mine
unless
people
meddle
with
me
i
not
meddle
with
them
cyril
is
safe
for
me
what
on
earth
am
i
to
do
for
my
cloak
debated
herbert
i
was
going
going
where
i
want
it
why
you
want
it
so
asked
mademoiselle
sharply
because
it
cold
responded
herbert
the
cloak
was
warmer
than
my
overcoat
is
last
night
you
go
out
you
go
out
you
go
out
it
is
always
so
now
i
have
a
lot
of
perplexing
business
upon
me
answered
herbert
i
have
no
time
to
see
about
it
in
the
day
some
little
time
longer
he
remained
talking
with
her
partially
disputing
the
italian
from
some
cause
or
other
went
into
and
said
some
provoking
things
herbert
it
must
be
confessed
received
them
with
good
temper
and
she
grew
more
affable
when
he
left
her
she
offered
to
pick
the
loose
threads
out
of
the
cloak
and
hem
up
the
bottom
you
lock
the
door
while
you
do
it
he
urged
i
will
take
it
to
my
chamber
she
said
no
one
will
molest
me
there
herbert
left
it
with
her
and
went
out
cyril
went
out
anthony
had
already
gone
out
dare
remained
at
home
he
and
his
wife
were
conversing
over
the
fire
in
the
course
of
the
evening
when
joseph
came
in
you
are
wanted
please
sir
he
said
to
his
master
who
wants
me
asked
dare
it
policeman
delves
sir
oh

him
in
here
said
dare
i
hope
something
will
be
done
in
this
he
added
to
his
wife
it
may
turn
out
a
good
slice
of
luck
for
me
sergeant
delves
came
in
in
point
of
fact
he
had
just
returned
from
that
interview
with
the
butcher
where
he
had
been
accompanied
by
ashley
and
william
well
delves
did
you
get
my
note
asked
dare
yes
sir
i
did
said
the
sergeant
taking
the
seat
offered
him
what
i
have
come
up
about
do
you
intend
to
act
upon
my
advice
why
no
i
think

replied
the
sergeant
not
at
any
rate
until
i
have
had
a
talk
with
you
what
will
you
take
well
sir
the
night
cold
i
do
mind
a
drop
of
it
was
brought
and
dare
joined
his
visitor
in
partaking
of
it
he
agreed
with
him
that
the
night
was
cold
but
nothing
could
dare
make
of
him
as
often
as
he
turned
the
conversation
on
the
subject
in
hand
so
often
did
the
sergeant
turn
it
off
again
dare
grew
tired
of
listening
to
nothing
and
she
departed
leaving
them
together
then
the
manner
of
sergeant
delves
changed
he
drew
his
chair
forward
and
bent
towards
dare
you
have
been
urging
me
to
go
against
young
halliburton
he
began
it
wo
do
halliburton

more

that
cheque
or
had
anything
to
do
with
it
than
you
or
i
had
dare
do
you
stir
in
this
matter
any
further
my
present
intention
is
to
stir
it
to
the
bottom
returned
dare
look
here
said
the
sergeant
in
an
undertone
i
am
not
obliged
to
take
notice
of
offences
that
do
come
legally
in
my
way
many
a
thing
has
been
done
in
this
town
ay
and
is
being
done
now
that
i
am
obliged
to
wink
at
it
do
lay
right
in
my
duty
to
take
notice
of
it
so
i
keep
my
eyes
shut
now
that
just
it
in
this
case
so
long
as
the
parties
concerned
ashley
or
white
do
put
it
into
my
hands
officially
i
am
not
obliged
to
take
into
custody
or
to
act
upon
my
own
suspicions
and
i
wo
do
it
upon
suspicions
of
my
own
i
promise
it
if
i
am
forced
that
another
matter
are
you
alluding
to
halliburton
no
you
are
on
the
wrong
scent
i
say
and
you
think
you
are
on
the
right
one
i
could
put
my
finger
out
this
night
and
lay
it
on
the
fox
but

tell
you
sir
i
do
want
to
unless
i
am
compelled
do
compel
me
dare
of
all
people

the
world

leaned
back
in
his
chair
his
thumbs
in
his
waistcoat
armholes
no
suspicion
of
the
truth
had
crossed
him
and
he
could
not
understand
either
the
sergeant
or
his
manner
the
latter
rose
to
depart
the
other
cloak
similar
to
young
halliburton
belongs
to
your
son
herbert
he
whispered
as
he
passed
dare
it
was
his
brother
cyril
who
wore
it
on
saturday
night
and
who
changed
the
cheque
therefore
we
may
give
a
guess
as
to
who
took
the
cheque
out
of
ashley
desk
now

still
over
it
sir
for
his
sake
as

anthony
dare
fell
into
a
confusion
of
horror
and
consternation
leaving
the
sergeant
to
bow
himself
out
dare
heard
the
departure
and
returned
to
the
room
well
cried
she
briskly
is
he
going
to
accuse
halliburton
dare
did
not
answer
he
looked
up
in
a
beseeching
helpless
sort
of
manner
as
one
who
is
stunned
by
a
blow
what
is
the
matter
she
questioned
gazing
at
him
closely
are
you
ill
he
rose
up
shaking
as
if
ague
were
upon
him
no
no
perhaps
you
are
cold
said
dare
i
asked
you
what
delves
was
going
to
do
will
he
accuse
halliburton
be
still
sharply
cried
dare
in
a
tone
of
pain
the
matter
is
to
be
hushed
up
it

at
ashley
he
was
also
becoming
through
perseverance
an
excellent
scholar
in
a
plain
way
he
had
had
one
friend
to
help
him
and
that
was
william
halliburton
the
easts
had
removed
to
a
better
house
one
of
those
which
had
a
garden
in
front
of
it
no
garden
was
more
fragrant
than
theirs
and
it
was
kept
in
order
by
robert
and
thomas
east
the
house
was
larger
than
they
required
and
part
of
it
was
occupied
by
stephen
crouch
and
his
daughter
it
was
known
that
the
easts
were
putting
by
money
and
honey
fair
wondered
for
none
lived
more
comfortably
more
respectably
honey
fair
taking
it
as
a
whole
lived
neither
comfortably
nor
respectably
the
fishers
had
never
come
out
of
the
workhouse
and
joe
was
dead
the
crosses
turned
from
their
home
their
furniture
sold
had
found
lodgings
two
rooms
improvident
as
ever
were
they
they
did
not
attempt
to
rise
even
to
their
former
condition
but
grovelled
on
living
from
hand
to
mouth
the
masons
man
and
wife
passed
their
time
agreeably
in
quarrels
at
least
that
it
was
agreeable
may
be
assumed
for
the
quarrels
never
ceased
now
and
then
they
were
diversified
by
a
fight
the
children
were
growing
up
without
training
and
caroline
ah
i
do
know
that
it
will
do
much
good
to
ask
after
her
caroline
years
ago
had
taken
a
false
step
and
try
as
she
would
she
could
not
regain
her
footing
she
lived
in
a
garret
alone
she
had
so
lived
a
long
while
and
she
worked
her
fingers
to
the
bone
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
and
went
about
with
her
head
down
honey
fair
looked
askance
at
her
and
gathered
up
its
petticoats
when
they
saw
her
coming
as
you
saw
eliza
tyrrett
gather
up
hers
lest
they
should
come
into
contact
with
those
contaminations
the
carters
thrived
the
brumms
also
were
better
off
than
they
used
to
be
and
the
buffles
did
so
excellently
that
a
joke
went
about
that
they
would
be
retiring
on
their
fortune
but
the
greater
portion
of
honey
fair
was
full
of
trouble
and
improvidence
william
halliburton
frequently
found
himself
in
honey
fair
it
was
the
most
direct
road
from
his
house
to
that
of
monsieur
colin
the
french
master
william
sociably
inclined
by
nature
had
sometimes
dropped
in
at
one
or
other
of
the
houses
he
would
find
robert
east
labouring
at
his
books
much
more
than
he
need
have
laboured
had
some
little
assistance
been
given
him
in
his
progress
william
undertook
to
supply
it
it
became
quite
a
common
thing
for
him
to
go
round
and
pass
an
hour
with
the
easts
and
stephen
crouch
the
unpleasant
social
features
of
honey
fair
thus
obtruded
themselves
on
william
halliburton
notice
it
was
impossible
that
any
one
passing
much
through
honey
fair
should
not
be
struck
with
them
could
nothing
be
done
to
rescue
the
people
from
this
degraded
condition
and
a
degraded
one
it
was
compared
with
what
it
might
have
been
young
and
inexperienced
as
he
was
it
was
a
question
that
sometimes
arose
to
william
mind
dirty
homes
scolding
mothers
ragged
and
pining
children
rough
and
swearing
husbands
waste
discomfort
evil
the
women
laid
the
blame
on
the
men
reproached
them
with
wasting
their
evenings
and
their
money
at
the
the
men
retorted
upon
the
women
and
said
they
had
not
a
home
fit
for
a
pig
to
come
into
meanwhile
the
money
whether
earned
by
husband
or
wife
it
went
somehow
bringing
apparently
nothing
to
show
for
it
and
the
least
possible
return
of
good
thus
they
struggled
and
squabbled
on
their
lives
little
better
than
one
continued
scene
of
scramble
discomfort
and
toil
at
a
year
end
they
were
not
in
the
least
bettered
not
in
the
least
raised
socially
morally
or
physically
from
their
condition
at
the
year
commencement
nothing
had
been
achieved
except
that
they
were
one
year
nearer
to
the
great
barrier
which
separates
time
from
eternity
ask
them
what
they
were
toiling
and
struggling
for
they
did
not
know
what
was
their
end
their
aim
they
had
none
if
they
could
only
rub
on
and
keep
body
and
soul
together
as
poor
caroline
mason
was
trying
to
do
in
her
garret
it
appeared
to
be
all
they
cared
for
they
did
not
endeavour
to
lift
up
their
hopes
or
their
aspirations
above
that
they
were
willing
so
to
go
on
until
death
should
come
what
a
life
what
an
end
a
feeling
would
now
and
then
come
over
william
that
he
might
in
some
way
help
them
to
attempt
better
things
to
do
so
was
a
duty
which
seemed
to
be
lying
across
his
path
that
he
might
take
it
up
and
make
it
his
how
to
set
about
it
he
knew
no
more
than
the
man
in
the
moon
now
and
then
disheartening
moments
would
come
upon
him
to
attempt
to
sweep
away
the
evils
of
honey
fair
appeared
a
far
more
formidable
task
than
to
cleanse
the
augean
stables
could
ever
have
appeared
to
hercules
he
knew
that
any
endeavour
whether
on
his
part
or
on
that
of
others
who
might
be
far
more
experienced
and
capable
than
he
would
be
utterly
fruitless
unless
the
incentive
to
exertion
to
strive
to
do
better
should
be
first
born
within
themselves
ah
my
friends
the
aid
of
others
may
be
looked
upon
as
a
great
thing
but
without
and
little
good
will
be
effected
one
evening
in
passing
the
house
partially
occupied
by
the
crosses
the
door
was
flung
violently
open
a
girl
of
fifteen
flew
shrieking
out
and
a
saucer
of
wet
came
flying
after
her
the
alighted
on
the
girl
neck
just
escaping
william
arm
it
was
the
youngest
girl
of
the
family
patty
the
had
come
from
cross
her
face
was
red
with
passion
her
voice
loud
the
girl
on
her
part
was
insulting
and
abusive
cross
had
her
hands
stretched
out
to
scratch
or
tear
or
pull
hair
and
a
personal
skirmish
would
inevitably
have
ensued
but
for
the
chance
of
william
being
there
he
received
the
hands
upon
his
arm
and
contrived
to
detain
them
what
the
matter
mrs
cross
matter
raved
cross
she
a
idle
impedent
wicked
huzzy
what
the
matter
she
knows
i
my
gloving
to
get
in
for
saturday
and
not
a
stroke
she
help
there
the
dishes
lying
dirty
from
dinner
the
lying
from
tea
and
touch
she
wo
she
expects
me
to
do
it
and
me
with
my
gloving
to
find
in
food
i
took
hold
of
her
arm
to
make
her
do
it
and
she
turned
and
struck
at
me
the
faggot
i
hope
none
on
it
did
go
on
you
sir
added
cross
somewhat
modifying
her
voice
and
pausing
to
recover
breath
better
that
it
had
gone
on
my
coat
than
on
patty
neck
replied
he
in
a
tone
though
indeed
the
girl
with
her
evil
look
at
her
mother
her
insolent
air
stood
there
scarcely
worth
his
defence
if
my
mother
asked
me
to
wash
or
do
anything
else
patty
i
should
do
it
and
think
it
a
pleasure
to
help
her
he
added
to
the
girl
patty
pushed
her
tangled
hair
behind
her
ears
and
turned
a
defiant
look
upon
her
mother
hidden
as
she
had
thought
it
from
william
he
saw
it
you
just
wait
nodded
cross
in
answer
as
defiant
i
make
your
back
smart
which
of
the
two
was
the
more
in
fault
it
was
hard
to
say
the
girl
had
never
been
brought
up
to
know
her
duty
or
to
do
it
the
mother
from
her
earliest
childhood
had
given
abuse
and
blows
no
kindly
persuasive
words
no
training
little
wonder
now
patty
was
growing
up
that
she
turned
again
it
was
the
usual
sort
of
maternal
government
throughout
honey
fair
in
these
and
similar
cases
where
could
interference
or
counsel
avail
unless
the
spirit
of
the
mothers
and
daughters
could
be
changed
william
walked
on
after
the
little
episode
of
the
he
could
not
help
contrasting
these
homes
with
his
home
their
life
with
his
life
he
was
given
to
reflection
beyond
his
years
and
he
wished
these
people
could
be
aroused
to
improvement
both
of
mind
and
body
they
were
living
for
no
end
toiling
only
to
satisfy
the
wants
of
the
day
nay
to
arrest
the
wants
rather
than
to
satisfy
them
how
many
of
them
were
so
much
as
thinking
of
another
world
their
toil
and
turmoil
in
this
was
too
great
to
enable
them
to
cast
a
thought
to
the
next
i
wonder
mused
william
as
he
stepped
towards
colin
whether
some
of
the
of
the
men
might
not
be
induced
to
come
round
to
east
in
an
evening
it
might
be
a
beginning
at
any
rate
once
wean
the
men
from
the
and
there
no
knowing
what
reform
might
be
effected
i
would
willingly
give
up
an
hour
or
two
of
my
evenings
to
them
his
visit
to
colin
over
he
retraced
his
steps
to
honey
fair
and
turned
into
robert
east
it
was
past
eight
then
robert
and
stephen
crouch
were
home
from
work
and
were
getting
out
their
books
charlotte
sat
by
at
work
as
usual
and
tom
east
was
drawing
head
towards
him
to
whisper
something
to
her
robert
said
william
speaking
impulsively
the
moment
he
entered
i
wonder
whether
you
could
induce
a
few
of
your
neighbours
to
come
here
of
an
evening
what
for
sir
asked
robert
turning
round
from
the
where
he
stood
searching
for
some
volume
it
might
be
so
much
better
for
them
it
might
end
in
being
so
i
wish
he
added
with
sudden
warmth
we
could
get
all
honey
fair
here
all
honey
fair
echoed
stephen
crouch
in
astonishment
i
mean
what
i
say
crouch
why
sir
the
room
would
hold
a
quarter
or
a
tenth
part
or
a
hundredth
part
of
them
william
laughed
no
that
it
would
not
practically
there
is
so
much
discomfort
around
us
and
and
i
must
call
it
so
for
want
of
a
better
name
that
i
sometimes
wish
we
could
mend
it
a
little
who
mend
it
sir
any
one
who
would
try
you
two
might
help
towards
it
if
you
could
seduce
a
few
round
here
and
get
them
to
be
interested
in
your
own
evening
occupation
books
and
rational
conversation
and
so
wean
them
from
the
it
would
be
a
great
thing
there
never
be
any
good
done
with
the
men
take
them
as
a
whole
sir
they
are
an
ignorant
lot
and
do
care
to
be
better
that
just
it
crouch
they
do
care
to
be
better
but
they
might
be
taught
to
care
it
would
be
a
very
great
thing
if
honey
fair
could
be
brought
to
spend
its
evenings
as
you
spend
yours
if
the
men
gave
up
spending
their
money
and
reeling
home
after
it
and
the
women
kept
tidy
hearths
and
civil
tongues
as
charlotte
does
he
added
looking
round
at
her
there
no
denying
that
sir
i
think
something
might
be
done
by
degrees
you
understand
not
in
a
hurry
were
you
to
take
the
men
by
storm
to
say
want
you
to
lead
changed
lives
and
are
going
to
show
you
how
to
do
it
your
movement
would
fail
and
you
would
get
laughed
at
into
the
bargain
say
to
the
men
sha
go
to
the
because
you
waste
your
time
your
money
and
your
temper
and
rely
upon
it
it
would
have
as
much
effect
as
if
you
spoke
to
the
wind
but
get
them
to
come
here
as
a
sort
of
change
and
you
may
secure
them
for
good
if
you
make
the
evenings
pleasant
to
them
in
short
give
them
some
employment
or
attraction
that
will
outweigh
the
attractions
of
the
it
would
certainly
be
a
good
thing
said
stephen
crouch
musingly
they
might
be
for
trying
to
raise
themselves
then
ay
spoke
william
with
enthusiasm
once
let
them
find
the
within
themselves
the
wish
to
do
right
to
be
raised
above
what
they
are
now
and
the
rest
will
be
easy
when
once
that
can
be
found
a
man
is
made
god
never
sent
a
man
here
but
he
implanted
that
within
him
the
difficulty
is
to
awaken
it
and
it
is
not
always
done
sir
said
charlotte
lifting
her
face
from
her
work
with
a
kindling
eye
a
heightened
colour
had
found
it
charlotte
i
fear
it
is
rarely
done
instead
of
not
always
it
lies
pretty
dormant
to
judge
by
appearances
in
honey
fair
william
was
right
it
is
an
epoch
in
a
man
life
that
finding
what
he
had
not
inaptly
called
the
the
courage
of
patience
the
striving
to
make
the
best
of
the
mind
good
gifts
all
are
born
of
it
he
who
possesses
it
may
soar
to
a
bright
and
happy
lot
bearing
in
mind
may
he
always
bear
it
the
rest
and
reward
promised
hereafter
at
any
rate
it
would
be
giving
them
a
chance
as
it
seems
to
me
observed
william
i
think
i
know
one
who
would
come
andrew
brumm
ah
would
and
be
glad
to
come
replied
robert
east
he
is
different
from
many
of
them
i
know
another
who
would
sir
and
adam
thornycroft
charlotte
bent
her
head
over
her
work
since
that
cousin
of
his
died
of
thornycroft
has
said
to
the
he
spends
his
evenings
at
home
with
his
mother
but
i
know
he
would
like
to
spend
them
here
tim
carter
would
come
sir
if
tim
will
let
him
put
in
tom
east
saucily
and
a
laugh
went
round
ever
so
few
to
begin
with
will
set
the
example
to
others
remarked
william
there
no
knowing
what
it
may
grow
to
small
beginnings
make
great
endings
i
have
talked
with
my
mother
about
honey
fair
she
has
always
said
honey
fair
conduct
can
be
improved
its
minds
must
be
improved
there
will
be
the
women
yet
sir
spoke
charlotte
if
they
are
to
remain
as
they
are
it
will
be
of
little
use
the
men
doing
anything
for
themselves
charlotte
once
begun
i
say
there
no
knowing
where
the
work
may
end
he
gravely
answered
the
rain
which
had
been
threatening
all
the
evening
was
coming
down
pretty
smartly
as
william
walked
through
honey
fair
on
his
return
standing
against
a
shutter
near
his
own
door
was
jacob
cross
good
night
jacob
said
william
goodnight
sir
answered
jacob
sullenly
are
you
standing
in
the
rain
that
it
may
make
you
grow
as
the
children
say
asked
william
in
his
tone
i
standing
here
i
nowhere
else
to
stand
said
the
man
his
voice
full
of
resentment
i
turned
out
of
our
room
and
i
have
no
money
for
the
horned
ram
a
good
thing
you
have
not
thought
william
what
has
turned
you
out
of
your
room
he
asked
i
turned
out
sir
by
the
row
there
is
in
it
our
mary
ann
come
home
mary
ann
repeated
william
not
quite
understanding
our
mary
ann
what
took
and
married
ben
tyrrett
a
fine
market
she
have
brought
her
pigs
to
what
has
she
done
questioned
william
she
done
enough
wrathfully
answered
cross
we
told
her
when
she
married
tyrrett
that
he
was
nothing
but
a
jobber
at
fifteen
shillings
and
it
all
he
was
sir
as
you
know
i
says
to
her
better
than
him
turn
up
her
mother
says
others
says
no
not
she
the
girls
are
all
marrying
mad
well
she
took
her
own
way
she
would
take
it
and
they
got
married
and
set
up
upon
nothing
neither
of
had
saved
a
and
ben
fond
of
the
public
and
our
mary
ann
fond
of
laziness
and
finery
and
not
knowing
how
to
keep
house
any
more
than
her
young
sister
patty
did
william
remembered
the
little
interlude
of
that
evening
in
which
miss
patty
had
played
her
part
jacob
continued
it
was
all
fine
and
sunshiny
with
for
a
few
days
or
a
few
weeks
till
the
novelty
wears
off
and
then
they
finds
things
going
cranky
the
money
begins
to
run
short
and

she
finds
that
ben
likes
his
glass
and
ben
he
finds
that
she
just
a
doll
with
no
gumption
or
management
inside
her
they
quarrels
naterally
and
they
comes
to
us
to
settle
it
was
both
for
the
bargain
says
i
you
must
just
make
the
best
of
it
and
of
one
another
and
so
they
went
back
and
it
has
gone
on
till
this
quarrelling
continual
and
now
he
took
to
beat
her
and
home
she
came
not
half
an
hour
ago
with
her
three
children
and
a
black
eye
vowing
she
stop
at
home
and
wo
go
back
to
him
again
and
she
and
her
mother
having
words
over
it
and
the
babies
enough
noise
to
raise
the
ceiling
off
and
i
come
out
of
it
i
wish
i
was
dead
i
do
jacob
account
of
the
noise
was
scarcely
exaggerated
it
penetrated
to
where
they
stood
two
or
three
houses
off
william
had
moved
closer
that
the
umbrella
might
give
cross
part
of
its
shelter
not
a
very
sensible
wish
that
of
yours
is
it
cross
remarked
he
i
have
wished
it
long
sir
sensible
or
not
sensible
i
slaves
away
my
days
and
have
nothing
but
a
pigsty
to
step
into
at
home
and
angry
words
in
it
a
nice
place
for
a
tired
man
i
ca
afford
the
public
more
than
three
or
four
nights
not
that
always
they
getting
corky
at
the
nowadays
and
wo
give
trust
wednesday
this
is
thursday
friday
next
night
three
nights
and
me
without
a
shelter
to
put
my
head
in
i
should
like
to
take
you
to
one
night
said
william
will
you
go
with
me
where
to
ungraciously
asked
cross
to
robert
east
you
know
how
he
and
crouch
spend
their
evenings
there
always
something
going
on
there
interesting
and
pleasant
crouch
and
east
do
want
me
yes
they
do
they
will
be
only
too
glad
if
you
and
a
few
more
intelligent
men
will
join
them
try
it
cross
there
a
warm
room
to
sit
in
at
all
events
and
nothing
to
pay
ah
it
all
very
fine
for
them
easts
we
have
their
luck
look
at
me
down
in
the
world
william
put
his
hand
on
the
man
shoulder
why
should
you
be
down
in
the
world
why
should
i
repeated
cross
in
surprise
because
i
am
he
logically
answered
that
is
not
the
reason
the
reason
is
because
you
do
not
try
to
rise
in
the
world
it
no
use
trying
have
you
ever
tried
why
no
how
can
i
try
you
wished
just
now
that
you
were
dead
would
it
not
be
better
to
wish
to
live
not
such
a
life
as
mine
but
to
wish
to
live
would
seem
to
imply
that
it
must
be
a
better
life
and
why
need
your
life
be
so
miserable
you
gain
fair
wages
your
wife
earns
money
altogether
i
suppose
you
must
have
or
shillings
a
week
but
there
no
thrift
with
it
exclaimed
cross
it
melts
away
somehow
before
the
middle
of
the
week
comes
it
all
gone
you
spend
some
at
the
horned
ram
you
know
said
william
not
in
a
reproving
tone
she
squanders
away
in
rubbish
more
than
that
was
jacob
answer
pointing
towards
his
house
and
not
giving
at
all
a
complimentary
stress
upon
the
she
and
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
in
return
either
of
you
try
another
plan
jacob
i
not
be
backward
if
i
could
see
one
to
try
said
he
after
a
pause
be
here
at
eight
evening
and
i
will
go
in
with
you
to
east
if
you
can
not
see
any
better
way
you
can
spend
a
pleasant
evening
but
now
jacob
let
me
say
a
word
to
you
and
do
you
note
it
if
you
find
the
evening
pass
agreeably
go
the
next
evening
and
the
next
go
always
you
ca
tell
all
that
may
arise
from
it
in
time
i
know
of
one
thing
that
will
what
that
sir
why
that
instead
of
wishing
yourself
dead
you
will
grow
to
think
life
too
short
for
the
good
you
find
in
it
he
went
on
his
way
jacob
cross
deprived
of
the
umbrella
stood
in
the
rain
as
before
and
looked
after
him
indulging
his
reflections
he
is
a
young
man
and
things
wear
their
bright
side
to
him
but
he
has
a
cordial
way
with
him
and
do
look
at
folks
as
if
they
was
dirt
and
that
had
been
the
origin
of
the
held
at
robert
east
by
degrees
ten
or
a
dozen
men
took
to
going
there
and
what
was
more
to
like
to
go
and
to
find
an
interest
in
it
it
was
a
great
improvement

the
horned
ram

object
in
life
on
one
of
the
warm
bright
days
that
we
sometimes
have
in
the
month
of
february
all
the
brighter
from
their
contrast
to
the
passing
winter
william
halliburton
was
walking
home
to
tea
from
the
manufactory
and
overtook
henry
ashley
limping
along
henry
was
below
the
middle
height
and
slight
in
form
with
the
same
beautiful
face
that
had
marked
his
boyhood
delicately
refined
in
feature
brilliant
in
colour
the
same
upright
lines
of
pain
knit
in
the
smooth
white
brow
just
the
man
i
wanted
said
he
linking
his
arm
within
william
you
are
a
good
help
up
a
hill
and
i
am
hot
and
tired
wrapped
up
in
that
coat
with
its
fur
lining
i
should
think
you
are
i
have
doffed
my
elegant
cloak
you
see
is
it
off
to
the
british
museum
william
laughed
i
have
not
had
time
to
pack
it
up
i
am
glad
i
met
you
you
must
come
home
to
tea
with
me
well
why
are
you
hesitating
you
have
no
engagement
nothing
more
than
usual
my
studies
you
are
study
mad
interrupted
henry
ashley
what
do
you
want
to
be
a
socrates
an
admirable
crichton
nothing
so
formidable
i
want
to
be
useful
and
you
make
yourself
accomplished
as
a
preliminary
step
to
it
mary
took
up
the
for
you
yesterday
herbert
dare
was
at
our
house
some
freak
is
taking
him
to
be
a
pretty
constant
visitor
just
now
and
the
talk
turned
upon
frank
you
know
broke
off
henry
in
his
quaint
way
i
never
use
long
words
when
short
ones
will
do
you
learned
ones
would
say
keating
had
said
to
my
father
that
frank
halliburton
was
a
brilliant
scholar
and
i
retailed
it
to
herbert
i
knew
it
would
put
him
up
and
there
nothing
i
like
half
so
much
as
to
the
dares
herbert
sneered
he
owes
it
partly
to
william
i
went
on
if
frank
a
brilliant
scholar
william
a
halliburton
a
brilliant
scholar
stormed
scornful
herbert
he
learnt
to
be
one
at
the
manufactory
so
long
as
he
knows
how
gloves
are
made
that
enough
for
him
what
does
want
with
the
requirements
of
gentlemen
up
looked
miss
mary
her
colour
rising
her
eyes
flashing
she
was
at
her
drawing
at
which
by
the
way
she
makes
no
progress
nothing
to
be
compared
with
anna
lynn
halliburton
has
forgotten
more
than
you
ever
learnt
herbert
dare
cried
she
there
more
of
the
true
gentleman
in
his
little
finger
than
there
is
in
your
whole
body
for
you
herbert
dare
whistled
i
it
true
lad
like
it
or
not
as
you
may
herbert
riled
henry
turned
his
head
as
he
concluded
and
looked
up
at
william
a
gleam
like
a
sunbeam
had
flashed
into
william
eyes
a
colour
to
his
cheeks
well
cried
henry
sharply
for
william
did
not
speak
have
you
nothing
to
say
it
was
generous
of
miss
ashley
i
do
mean
that
oh
dear
sighed
henry
who
appeared
to
be
in
one
of
his
fitful
moods
who
is
to
know
whether
things
will
turn
out
crooked
or
straight
in
this
world
of
ours
what
objection
have
you
to
coming
home
with
me
for
the
evening
that
what
i
mean
none
i
can
give
up
my
books
for
a
night
bookworm
as
you
think
me
but
they
will
expect
me
at
east
happy
the
man
that
expecteth
nothing
responded
henry
disappoint
them
as
for
disappointing
them
i
should
so
much
mind
but
i
ca
abide
to
disappoint
myself
returned
william
quoting
from
goldsmith
good
old
play
of
which
both
he
and
henry
were
fond
you
do
mean
to
say
it
would
be
a
disappointment
to
not
giving
the
lesson
or
whatever
it
is
to
those
working
chaps
uttered
henry
ashley
not
as
you
would
count
disappointment
when
i
do
not
get
round
for
an
hour
it
seems
as
a
night
lost
i
know
the
men
like
to
see
me
and
i
am
always
fearing
that
we
are
not
sure
of
them
you
speak
as
though
your
whole
soul
were
in
the
business
returned
henry
ashley
i
think
my
heart
is
in
it
henry
looked
at
him
wistfully
and
his
tone
grew
serious
william
i
would
give
all
i
am
worth
present
and
to
come
to
change
places
with
you
to
change
places
with
me
echoed
william
in
surprise
yes
for
you
have
an
object
in
life
you
may
have
many
to
be
useful
in
your
generation
is
one
of
them
and
so
may
you
have
objects
in
life
with
this
encumbrance
he
stamped
his
lame
leg
and
a
look
of
keen
vexation
settled
itself
in
his
face
you
can
go
forth
into
the
world
with
your
strong
limbs
your
unbroken
health
you
can
work
or
you
can
play
you
can
be
active
or
you
can
be
still
at
will
but
what
am
i
a
poor
weak
creature
infirm
of
temper
tortured
by
pain
condemned
half
my
days
to
the
monotony
of
a
compare
my
lot
with
yours
there
are
those
who
would
choose
your
lot
in
preference
to
mine
were
the
option
given
them
returned
william
i
must
work
it
is
a
duty
laid
upon
me
you
can
play
thank
you
how
i
am
not
speaking
literally
every
good
and
pleasing
thing
that
money
can
purchase
is
at
your
command
you
have
only
to
enjoy
them
so
far
as
you
may
one
suffering
as
you
do
bears
not
upon
him
the
responsibility
to
his
time
that
a
healthy
man
does
lots
in
this
world
henry
are
as
i
believe
pretty
equally
balanced
many
would
envy
you
your
life
of
calm
repose
it
is
not
calm
was
the
abrupt
rejoinder
it
is
disturbed
by
pain
and
aggravated
by
temper
and
and
tormented
by
uncertainty
at
any
rate
you
can
subdue
the
one
which
pray
the
temper
henry
dropping
his
voice
a
victory
over
your
own
temper
may
be
one
of
the
few
obligations
laid
upon
you
i
wish
i
could
live
for
an
object
grumbled
henry
come
round
with
me
to
east
sometimes
i
daresay
retorted
henry
when
he
could
recover
from
his
amazement
thank
you
again
mr
halliburton
william
laughed
but
he
soon
resumed
his
seriousness
i
can
understand
that
for
you
the
favoured
son
of
ashley
reared
in
refinement
and
exclusiveness
enshrined
in
pride
the
failing
that
helstonleigh
is
pleased
to
call
my
besetting
sin
sheltered
under
care
and
coddling
so
great
that
the
very
winds
of
heaven
are
not
suffered
to
visit
my
face
too
roughly
was
the
impetuous
interruption
of
henry
ashley
come
bring
it
all
out
do
from
motives
of
delicacy
keep
in
any
of
my
faults
virtues
or
advantages
i
can
understand
i
say
why
you
are
unwilling
to
break
through
the
reserve
of
your
home
habits
william
calmly
continued
but
if
you
did
so
you
might
no
longer
have
to
complain
of
the
want
of
an
object
in
life
at
this
moment
they
came
in
view
of
william
house
halliburton
happened
to
be
at
one
of
the
windows
william
nodded
his
greeting
and
henry
raised
his
hat
presently
henry
began
again
pray
do
you
join
the
town
in
its
gratuitous
opinion
that
henry
ashley
of
all
in
it
is
the
proudest
amid
the
proud
i
do
not
find
you
proud
said
william
you
as
far
as
you
and
i
are
concerned
i
think
the
boot
might
be
on
the
other
leg
you
might
set
up
for
being
proud
over
me
william
could
not
help
laughing
putting
joking
aside
my
opinion
is
henry
that
your
shyness
and
sensitiveness
are
in
fault
not
your
pride
it
is
your
reserved
manner
alone
which
has
caused
helstonleigh
to
take
up
the
impression
that
you
are
unduly
proud
right
old
fellow
returned
henry
in
emphatic
tones
if
you
knew
how
far
i
and
pride
stand
apart
but
let
it
pass
arrived
at
the
entrance
to
ashley
william
threw
open
the
gate
for
henry
retreating
himself
i
must
go
home
first
henry
i
wo
be
a
quarter
of
an
hour
henry
looked
cross
why
on
earth
then
did
you
not
go
in
as
we
passed
what
was
the
use
of
your
coming
up
here
to
go
back
again
i
thought
my
arm
was
helping
you
so
it
was
but
there
do
be
an
hour
as
william
walked
rapidly
back
he
met
ashley
carriage
she
and
mary
were
in
it
ashley
nodded
as
he
raised
his
hat
and
mary
glanced
at
him
with
a
smile
and
a
heightened
colour
she
had
grown
up
to
excessive
beauty
a
few
moments
and
william
met
beauty
of
another
style
anna
lynn
her
cheeks
were
the
flushed
dimpled
cheeks
of
her
childhood
the
same
eyes
gleaming
from
between
their
long
dark
lashes
the
same
profusion
of
silky
brown
hair
the
same
gentle
sweetly
modest
manners
william
stopped
to
shake
hands
with
her
out
alone
anna
i
am
on
my
way
to
take
tea
with
mary
ashley
are
you
we
shall
meet
there
then
that
will
be
pleasant
fare
thee
well
for
the
present
william
she
continued
her
way
william
ran
in
home
and
to
his
chamber
dressing
himself
hastily
he
went
to
the
room
where
his
mother
sat
and
stood
before
her
does
my
coat
fit
me
mother
why
where
are
you
going
she
asked
to
ashley
i
have
put
on
my
new
coat
does
it
do
it
seems
all
right
throwing
up
his
arms
yes
it
fits
you
exactly
i
think
you
are
growing
a
dandy
go
along
i
must
not
look
at
you
too
long
why
not
he
asked
in
surprise
in
case
i
grow
proud
of
my
eldest
son
and
i
would
rather
be
proud
of
his
goodness
than
of
his
looks
william
laughingly
gave
his
mother
a
farewell
kiss
tell
gar
i
am
sorry
he
will
not
have
me
at
his
elbow
this
evening
to
find
fault
with
his
greek
mother
dear
in
truth
there
was
something
remarkably
noble
in
william
appearance
as
he
entered
ashley
the
fact
seemed
to
strike
upon
henry
with
unusual
force
who
greeted
him
from
his
distant
sofa
so
that
what
you
went
back
for
to
turn
yourself
into
a
buck
he
called
out
as
william
approached
him
as
if
you
were
not
well
enough
before
did
you
dress
for
me
pray
for
you
laughed
william
that
good
in
saying
i
include
the
family
returned
henry
quaintly
there
no
one
else
to
dress
for
yes
there
is
there
anna
lynn
now
in
good
truth
william
had
no
covert
meaning
in
giving
this
answer
the
words
rose
to
his
lips
and
he
spoke
them
lightly
perhaps
he
could
have
given
a
very
different
one
had
he
been
compelled
to
speak
out
the
inmost
feeling
of
his
heart
strange
however
was
the
effect
on
henry
ashley
he
grasped
william
arm
with
emotion
and
pulled
his
face
down
to
him
as
he
lay
what
do
you
say
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
nothing
in
particular
anna
here
you
shall
not
evade
me
gasped
henry
i
must
have
it
out
now
or
later
what
is
it
that
you
mean
william
stood
almost
confounded
henry
was
evidently
in
painful
excitement
every
vestige
of
colour
had
forsaken
his
sensitive
countenance
and
his
white
hands
shook
as
they
held
william
what
do
mean
william
whispered
i
said
nothing
to
agitate
you
thus
that
i
am
aware
of
are
we
at
a
spot
bright
as
carmine
began
to
flush
into
the
invalid
pale
cheeks
and
he
moved
his
face
so
that
the
light
did
not
fall
upon
it
i
have
it
out
i
say
what
is
anna
lynn
to
you
nothing
answered
william
a
smile
parting
his
lips
what
is
she
to
you
reiterated
henry
his
tone
painfully
earnest
william
edged
himself
on
to
the
sofa
so
as
to
cover
henry
from
the
gaze
of
any
eyes
that
might
be
directed
to
him
from
the
other
parts
of
the
room
i
like
anna
very
much
he
said
in
a
clear
low
tone
almost
as
i
might
like
a
sister
but
i
have
no
love
for
her
in
the
sense
you
would
imply
if
i
am
not
mistaking
your
meaning
and
i
never
shall
have
henry
looked
at
him
wistfully
on
your
honour
henry
was
there
need
to
ask
it
on
my
honour
if
you
will
no
no
there
was
no
need
you
are
always
truthful
bear
with
me
william
bear
with
my
infirmities
my
sister
anna
lynn
might
be
and
welcome
my
wife
never
henry
did
not
answer
his
face
was
growing
damp
with
physical
pain
you
have
one
of
your
fits
of
suffering
coming
on
breathed
william
shall
i
get
you
anything
hush
only
sit
there
to
hide
me
from
them
and
be
still
william
did
as
he
was
requested
sitting
so
as
to
screen
him
from
ashley
and
the
rest
he
held
his
hands
and
the
paroxysm
sharp
while
it
lasted
passed
away
henry
very
lips
had
grown
white
with
pain
you
see
what
a
poor
wretch
i
am
i
see
that
you
suffer
was
william
compassionate
answer
from
henceforth
there
is
a
fresh
bond
of
union
between
us
for
you
possess
my
secret
it
is
what
no
one
else
in
the
world
does
william
my
object
in
life
william
did
not
reply
perplexity
was
crowding
on
his
mind
shading
his
countenance
well
cried
henry
beginning
to
recover
his
equanimity
and
with
it
his
sharp
retorts
why
are
you
looking
so
blue
will
it
be
smooth
sailing
for
you
henry
with
mr
ashley
yes
i
think
it
will
was
the
hasty
rejoinder
its
very
haste
its
fractious
tone
proving
that
henry
was
by
no
means
so
sure
of
it
as
he
would
imply
i
am
not
as
others
are
therefore
he
will
let
minor
considerations
yield
to
my
happiness
william
looked
uncommonly
grave
ashley
is
not
all
he
said
arousing
from
a
reverie
there
may
be
difficulties
elsewhere
she
must
not
marry
out
of
their
own
society
samuel
lynn
is
one
of
its
strictest
members
rubbish
samuel
lynn
is
my
father
servant
and
i
am
my
father
son
if
samuel
should
take
a
fit
and
hold
out
why
i
turn
broadbrim
samuel
lynn
is
my
father
servant
in
that
very
fact
william
saw
cause
to
fear
that
it
might
not
be
such
plain
sailing
with
ashley
as
henry
wished
to
anticipate
he
could
not
help
looking
the
doubts
he
felt
henry
observed
it
what
the
matter
now
he
peevishly
asked
i
do
think
you
were
born
to
be
the
plague
of
my
life
my
belief
is
you
want
her
for
yourself
i
am
only
anxious
for
you
henry
i
wish
you
could
have
assured
yourself
that
it
would
go
well
before
before
allowing
your
feelings
to
be
irrevocably
bound
up
in
it
a
blow
for
you
might
be
hard
to
bear
how
could
i
help
my
feelings
retorted
henry
i
did
not
fix
them
purposely
on
anna
lynn
before
i
knew
anything
about
it
they
had
fixed
themselves
almost
before
i
knew
that
i
cared
for
her
she
was
more
to
me
than
the
sun
in
the
heavens
there
has
been
no
help
for
it
at
all
i
tell
you
so
do
preach
have
you
spoken
to
her
henry
shook
his
head
the
time
has
not
come
for
it
i
must
make
it
right
with
the
master
before
i
can
stir
a
step
and
i
fear
it
is
not
quite
ripe
for
that
mind
do
talk
william
smiled
i
will
mind
you
better
if
that
quaker
society
got
a
hint
of
it
there
no
knowing
what
a
hullabaloo
they
might
make
they
might
be
for
reading
anna
a
public
lecture
at
meeting
or
get
samuel
lynn
to
vow
he
not
give
his
consent
i
should
argue
in
this
way
were
i
you
henry
with
my
love
so
firmly
fixed
on
anna
lynn
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
ashley
william
started
up
mary
ashley
was
standing
close
to
the
sofa
had
she
caught
the
sense
of
the
last
words
mamma
spoke
twice
but
you
were
too
busily
engaged
to
hear
said
mary
henry
james
is
waiting
to
wheel
your
sofa
to
the
henry
rose
passing
his
arm
through
william
he
approached
the
group
the
servant
pushed
the
sofa
after
them
standing
together
were
mary
ashley
and
anna
lynn
they
presented
a
great
contrast
to
each
other
mary
wore
an
evening
dress
of
shimmering
silk
its
low
body
trimmed
with
rich
white
lace
white
lace
hung
from
its
drooping
sleeves
and
she
had
on
ornaments
of
gold
anna
was
in
grey
merino
high
in
the
neck
close
at
the
wrists
not
a
bit
of
lace
about
her
not
an
ornament
nothing
but
a
plain
white
linen
collar
catch
me
letting
her
wear
those
methodistical
things
when
she
shall
be
mine
thought
henry
i
make
a
bonfire
of
the
lot
but
the
quaker
cap
ah
it
was
not
there
anna
had
continued
her
habit
at
home
of
throwing
it
off
as
formerly
patience
reprimanded
in
vain
she
was
not
seconded
by
samuel
lynn
we
are
by
ourselves
patience
it
does
not
much
matter
he
would
say
the
child
says
she
is
cooler
without
it
but
had
samuel
lynn
known
that
anna
was
in
the
habit
of
discarding
it
on
every
possible
occasion
when
she
was
from
home
he
had
been
as
severe
as
patience
at
ashley
especially
she
would
sit
as
now
without
it
her
lovely
face
made
more
lovely
by
its
falling
curls
anna
did
wrong
and
she
knew
it
but
she
was
a
wilful
girl
and
a
vain
one
that
pretty
timid
retiring
manner
concealed
much
much
vanity
though
in
some
things
she
was
as
easily
swayed
as
a
child
she
disobeyed
patience
in
another
matter
patience
would
say
to
her
should
mary
ashley
be
opening
her
instrument
of
music
thee
will
mind
not
to
listen
to
her
songs
thee
can
go
into
another
room
oh
yes
patience
she
would
answer
i
will
mind
but
instead
of
not
listening
miss
anna
would
place
herself
near
the
piano
and
drink
in
the
songs
as
if
her
whole
heart
were
in
the
music
music
had
a
great
effect
upon
her
and
there
she
would
sit
entranced
as
though
she
were
in
some
earthly
elysium
she
said
nothing
of
this
at
home
but
the
deceit
was
wrong
they
were
sitting
down
to
tea
when
herbert
dare
came
in
the
hours
for
meals
were
early
at
ashley
the
medical
men
considered
it
best
for
henry
herbert
could
be
a
gentleman
when
he
chose
also
quite
an
addition
to
a
he
took
his
seat
between
mary
and
anna
i
say
how
is
it
you
are
not
dining
at
home
this
evening
asked
henry
who
somehow
did
not
regard
the
dares
with
any
great
favour
i
dined
in
the
middle
of
the
day
was
herbert
reply
the
condescension
i
thought
only
plebeians
did
that
james
is
there
a
piece
of
chalk
in
the
house
i
must
chalk
that
up
henry
henry
reproved
ashley
oh
let
him
talk
ashley
said
herbert
with
supreme
good
humour
there
nothing
he
likes
so
well
as
a
wordy
war
nothing
in
the
world
acquiesced
henry
especially
with
herbert
dare
chapter
xxiii
atterly
field
laughing
talking
playing
at
proverbs
earning
and
paying
forfeits
it
was
a
merry
group
in
ashley
that
lady
herself
was
not
joining
in
the
merriment
she
sat
apart
at
a
small
table
some
work
in
her
hand
speaking
a
word
now
and
then
and
smiling
to
herself
in
echo
to
some
unusual
burst
of
laughter
it
was
so
surprising
that
only
five
voices
could
make
so
much
noise
they
were
sitting
in
a
circle
mary
ashley
between
william
halliburton
and
herbert
dare
anna
lynn
between
herbert
dare
and
henry
ashley
henry
and
william
side
by
side
time
in
these
happy
moments
passes
rapidly
in
due
course
the
hands
of
the
french
clock
on
the
pointed
to
eight
and
its
silver
tones
rang
out
the
chimes
they
were
at
the
end
of
the
game
and
just
settling
themselves
to
commence
another
the
aroused
william
and
he
glanced
towards
the
clock
eight
who
would
have
thought
it
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
late
i
must
leave
you
just
for
half
an
hour
he
added
rising
leave
for
what
cried
henry
ashley
to
go
as
far
as
east
i
will
not
remain
there
henry
broke
into
a
wordy
war
as
herbert
dare
had
called
it
earlier
in
the
evening
william
smiled
and
overruled
him
in
his
quiet
way
they
have
my
promise
to
go
round
this
evening
he
said
i
gave
it
them
unconditionally
and
must
just
go
round
to
tell
them
i
can
not
come
if
that
not
a
contradiction
do
look
so
cross
henry
of
course
you
do
mean
to
come
back
resentfully
spoke
henry
when
you
get
there
you
stop
there
no
i
have
told
you
i
will
not
but
if
i
let
them
expect
me
all
the
evening
they
will
be
looking
and
waiting
and
do
no
good
he
went
out
as
he
spoke
and
left
the
house
as
he
reached
the
gate
ashley
was
coming
in
ashley
had
been
in
the
manufactory
he
did
not
often
go
there
after
tea
going
already
william
ashley
exclaimed
in
accents
of
surprise
not
for
long
sir
i
must
just
look
in
at
east
is
that
scheme
likely
to
prosper
can
you
keep
the
men
yes
indeed
i
think
so
my
hopes
are
strong
well
there
nothing
like
hope
answered
ashley
with
a
laugh
but
i
shall
wonder
if
you
do
keep
them
william
he
added
after
a
slight
pause
his
tone
changing
to
a
business
one
i
have
a
few
words
to
say
to
you
i
was
about
to
speak
to
you
in
the
this
afternoon
but
something
put
it
aside
i
have
changed
my
plans
with
respect
to
this
lyons
journey
instead
of
despatching
you
as
i
had
thought
of
doing
i
believe
i
shall
send
samuel
lynn
ashley
paused
william
did
not
immediately
reply
samuel
lynn
experience
is
greater
than
yours
it
is
a
new
thing
and
he
will
see
better
than
you
could
do
what
can
and
what
can
not
be
done
very
well
sir
at
length
answered
william
you
speak
as
though
you
were
disappointed
remarked
ashley
william
was
disappointed
but
his
motive
for
the
feeling
lay
far
deeper
than
ashley
supposed
i
should
like
to
have
gone
sir
very
much
but
of
course
my
liking
or
not
liking
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
perhaps
it
is
as
well
that
i
should
not
go
he
resumed
more
in
soliloquy
as
if
he
were
trying
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
disappointment
by
argument
than
in
observation
to
ashley
i
do
not
see
how
the
men
would
have
done
without
me
at
east
ay
that
a
grave
consideration
replied
ashley
jokingly
as
he
turned
to
walk
to
his
own
door
william
stood
still
nailed
as
it
were
to
the
spot
looking
after
his
master
a
most
unwelcome
thought
had
flashed
over
him
and
in
the
impulse
of
the
moment
he
followed
ashley
to
speak
it
out
even
in
the
night
obscurity
his
emotion
was
perceptible
ashley
the
suspicion
cast
on
me
at
the
time
that
cheque
was
lost
has
not
been
the
reason
the
reason
for
your
declining
to
intrust
me
with
this
commission
ashley
looked
at
him
in
surprise
but
that
william
agitation
was
all
too
real
he
would
have
laughed
at
him
william
i
think
you
are
turning
silly
no
suspicion
was
cast
on
you
you
have
never
stirred
in
the
matter
sir
you
have
never
spoken
to
me
to
tell
me
you
were
satisfied
that
i
was
not
in
any
way
guilty
was
william
impulsive
answer
spoken
to
you
where
was
the
need
why
william
my
whole
life
my
daily
intercourse
with
you
is
only
so
much
proof
that
have
my
full
confidence
should
i
admit
you
to
my
home
to
the
companionship
of
my
children
if
i
had
no
more
faith
in
you
than
that
true
said
william
beginning
to
recover
himself
it
was
a
thought
that
flashed
over
me
sir
when
you
said
i
was
not
to
be
sent
on
this
journey
i
should
not
like
you
to
doubt
me
i
could
not
live
under
it
william
you
reproached
me
with
not
having
stirred
in
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
reproach
i
would
not
presume
to
do
it
i
have
not
stirred
in
the
matter
resumed
ashley
a
very
disagreeable
suspicion
arises
in
my
mind
at
times
as
to
how
the
cheque
went
and
i
do
not
choose
to
stir
in
it
have
you
no
suspicion
on
the
point
the
question
took
william
by
surprise
he
stammered
in
his
answer
an
unusual
thing
for
him
to
do
n
o
i
ask
if
you
have
a
suspicion
quietly
repeated
ashley
meaningly
as
if
he
took
william
answer
for
nothing
or
had
not
heard
it
then
william
spoke
out
readily
a
suspicion
has
crossed
my
mind
sir
but
it
is
one
i
should
not
like
to
breathe
to
you
that
enough
i
see
white
voluntarily
took
the
loss
of
the
money
on
himself
he
came
to
me
to
say
so
therefore
i
infer
that
it
has
in
some
private
way
been
refunded
to
him
dare
veered
round
and
advised
me
not
to
investigate
the
affair
as
i
was
no
loser
by
it
delves
hinted
the
same
thing
altogether
i
can
see
through
the
thing
pretty
clearly
and
i
am
content
to
let
it
rest
are
you
satisfied
if
not
ashley
broke
off
abruptly
william
waited
so
do
turn
foolish
again
you
and
i
now
understand
each
other
william
he
emphatically
added
i
am
growing
to
like
you
almost
as
i
like
my
own
children
i
am
proud
of
you
and
i
shall
be
prouder
yet
god
bless
you
my
boy
it
was
so
very
rare
that
the
calm
dignified
thomas
ashley
was
betrayed
into
anything
like
demonstrativeness
that
william
could
only
stand
and
look
and
while
he
looked
the
door
closed
on
his
master
he
went
way
with
all
speed
calling
at
his
home
were
the
truth
to
be
told
perhaps
william
was
quite
as
anxious
to
be
back
again
at
ashley
as
henry
was
that
he
should
be
there
scarcely
stopping
for
a
word
of
greeting
he
opened
a
drawer
took
from
it
a
small
case
of
fossils
and
then
searched
for
something
else
something
which
apparently
he
could
not
find
have
any
of
you
seen
my
microscope
he
asked
turning
to
the
group
at
the
table
bending
over
their
books
jane
looked
round
my
dear
i
lent
it
to
patience
i
suppose
she
forgot
to
return
it
gar
will
you
go
and
ask
her
for
it
do
disturb
yourself
gar
said
william
i
am
going
out
and
will
ask
patience
myself
patience
was
alone
in
her
parlour
she
returned
him
the
microscope
saying
that
the
reason
she
had
not
sent
it
in
was
that
she
had
not
had
time
to
use
it
thee
art
in
evening
dress
she
remarked
to
william
i
am
at
ashley
i
have
only
come
out
for
a
few
minutes
thank
you
good
night
patience
wait
thee
a
moment
william
is
anna
ready
to
come
home
no
that
she
is
not
why
i
want
to
send
for
her
samuel
lynn
is
spending
the
evening
in
the
town
so
i
must
send
grace
and
i
do
care
to
send
her
late
she
will
only
get
talking
to
john
pembridge
if
she
goes
out
after
he
is
home
from
work
william
smiled
it
is
natural
that
she
should
i
suppose
when
are
they
going
to
be
married
shortly
answered
patience
in
a
tone
not
quite
so
equable
as
usual
patience
saw
no
good
in
people
getting
married
in
general
and
she
was
vexed
at
the
prospect
of
losing
grace
in
particular
she
leaves
us
in
a
fortnight
from
this
she
continued
alluding
to
grace
and
all
her
thoughts
seem
to
be
bent
now
upon
meeting
john
pembridge
could
thee
bring
anna
home
for
me
with
pleasure
replied
william
that
is
well
then
grace
does
not
deserve
to
go
out
for
she
wilfully
crossed
me
good
evening
william
in
hand
and
the
microscope
in
his
pocket
william
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
honey
fair
robert
east
stephen
crouch
brumm
thornycroft
carter
cross
and
some
others
were
crowded
round
robert
table
william
handed
them
the
fossils
and
the
microscope
told
the
men
to
amuse
themselves
with
them
for
that
night
and
he
would
explain
more
about
them
on
the
morrow
he
was
ever
anxious
that
the
men
should
have
some
object
of
amusement
as
a
rallying
point
on
these
evenings
anything
to
keep
their
interest
awakened
before
the
had
expired
he
was
back
at
ashley
proverbs
had
been
given
up
and
mary
was
at
the
piano
ashley
had
been
accompanying
her
on
the
flute
on
which
instrument
he
was
a
brilliant
player
and
when
william
entered
she
was
singing
a
duet
with
herbert
dare
anna
disobedient
anna
was
seated
listening
with
all
her
ears
and
heart
to
the
music
her
countenance
quite
wonderful
to
look
upon
in
its
rapt
delight
i
think
you
could
sing
spoke
henry
ashley
to
her
in
an
undertone
after
watching
her
while
the
song
lasted
anna
shook
her
head
i
may
not
try
she
said
raising
her
blue
eyes
to
him
for
one
moment
and
then
dropping
them
the
time
may
come
when
you
may
returned
henry
in
a
deeper
whisper
she
did
not
answer
she
did
not
lift
her
eyes
but
the
faintest
possible
smile
parted
her
rosy
lips
a
smile
which
seemed
to
express
a
consciousness
that
perhaps
that
time
might
come
and
henry
shy
and
sensitive
stood
apart
and
gazed
upon
her
his
heart
beating
young
lady
said
william
advancing
do
you
know
that
a
special
honour
has
been
assigned
me
one
that
concerns
you
anna
raised
her
eyes
now
she
felt
as
much
at
ease
with
william
as
she
did
with
her
father
or
patience
what
dost
thee
say
william
an
honour
that
of
seeing
you
safely
home
i
what
that
for
interrupted
anna
where
my
father
he
is
not
at
home
this
evening
and
patience
did
not
care
to
send
out
grace
i
take
care
of
you
william
could
not
but
observe
the
sudden
flush
the
glow
of
pleasure
or
what
looked
like
pleasure
that
overspread
anna
countenance
at
the
information
what
that
for
he
thought
echoing
her
recent
words
but
mary
began
to
sing
again
and
his
attention
was
diverted
ten
was
the
signal
for
departure
as
they
were
going
out
william
anna
and
herbert
dare
who
took
the
opportunity
to
leave
with
them
henry
ashley
limped
after
them
and
drew
william
aside
in
the
hall
honour
bright
mind
my
friend
william
did
not
understand
honour
bright
always
said
he
but
what
do
you
mean
you
not
get
making
love
to
her
on
your
way
home
william
could
not
help
laughing
he
turned
his
amused
face
full
on
henry
be
at
rest
i
would
not
care
to
make
love
to
her
had
i
full
leave
and
license
from
the
quaker
society
granted
me
in
public
meeting
do
you
think
i
did
not
see
her
brightened
countenance
when
you
told
her
she
was
to
go
home
with
you
retorted
henry
i
saw
it
too
i
conclude
she
was
pleased
that
her
father
was
not
coming
for
her
little
undutiful
thing
however
it
may
have
been
rely
upon
it
that
brightening
was
not
for
me
pressing
his
hand
warmly
with
a
pressure
that
no
false
friend
ever
gave
william
hastened
away
it
was
time
herbert
dare
and
anna
had
not
waited
for
him
but
were
ever
so
far
ahead
very
polite
of
you
cried
william
when
he
caught
them
up
anna
had
you
gone
pitching
into
that
part
of
the
path
they
are
mending
i
should
have
been
responsible
you
know
you
might
have
waited
for
me
he
spoke
making
a
joke
of
it
herbert
dare
did
not
appear
to
receive
it
as
one
he
retorted
haughtily
do
you
suppose
i
am
not
capable
of
taking
care
of
miss
lynn
as
much
so
as
you
at
any
rate
possibly
coolly
returned
william
not
losing
his
tone
herbert
dare
had
given
anna
his
arm
william
walked
near
her
on
the
other
side
thus
they
reached
lynn
good
night
said
herbert
shaking
hands
with
her
good
night
to
you
halliburton
good
night
replied
william
herbert
dare
set
off
running
william
knocked
at
the
door
and
waited
until
it
was
opened
then
he
also
shook
hands
with
anna
and
saw
her
in
frank
and
gar
were
putting
up
their
books
for
the
night
when
william
entered
the
boarders
had
gone
to
bed
jane
a
very
unusual
thing
for
her
was
sitting
by
the
fire
doing
nothing
am
i
not
idle
william
she
said
william
bent
to
kiss
her
there
no
need
for
you
to
be
anything
but
idle
now
mother
no
need
william
you
know
better
there
great
need
that
none
should
be
idle
none
in
the
world
but
i
have
a
bad
headache
william
called
out
gar
they
brought
this
round
for
you
from
east
young
tom
came
with
it
it
was
the
case
of
fossils
and
the
microscope
william
observed
that
they
need
not
have
sent
them
as
he
should
want
them
there
the
next
evening
patience
said
she
had
not
had
time
to
use
the
microscope
he
continued
i
think
i
will
take
it
in
to
her
i
suppose
she
has
been
buying
linen
and
wants
to
see
if
the
threads
are
even
the
lynns
will
have
gone
to
bed
by
this
time
said
jane
not
i
have
only
just
seen
anna
home
from
ashley
and
lynn
has
gone
out
to
supper
he
turned
to
leave
the
room
with
the
microscope
but
gar
was
looking
at
the
fossils
and
asked
the
loan
of
it
a
few
minutes
and
william
finally
went
out
patience
came
to
the
door
in
answer
to
his
knock
she
thanked
him
for
the
microscope
and
stood
a
minute
or
two
chatting
patience
was
fond
of
a
gossip
there
was
no
denying
it
will
thee
not
walk
in
not
now
he
said
turning
away
good
night
patience
good
night
to
thee
thee
send
in
anna
please
she
is
having
a
pretty
long
talk
with
thy
mother
william
was
at
a
loss
i
saw
anna
in
from
mr
ashley
she
did
but
ask
whether
her
father
was
home
and
then
ran
through
the
house
replied
patience
she
had
a
message
for
thy
mother
she
said
from
margaret
ashley
ashley
does
not
send
messages
to
my
mother
returned
william
in
some
wonder
they
have
no
acquaintance
with
each
other
beyond
a
bow
in
passing
she
must
have
sent
her
one
why
else
should
the
child
go
in
to
deliver
it
persisted
patience
not
but
that
anna
is
always
running
into
thy
house
at
nights
i
fear
she
must
trouble
thy
mother
at
her
class
she
never
stays
long
enough
for
that
replied
william
when
she
does
come
in
and
it
is
not
often
she
just
opens
the
door
dost
thee
friend
jane
halliburton
and
out
again
then
thee
can
know
nothing
about
it
william
i
tell
thee
she
never
stays
less
than
an
hour
and
she
is
always
there
i
say
to
her
that
one
of
these
evenings
thy
mother
may
likely
be
hinting
to
her
that
her
room
will
be
more
acceptable
than
her
company
thee
send
her
home
now
please
william
turned
away
curious
thoughts
were
passing
through
his
mind
that
anna
did
not
go
in
in
the
frequent
manner
patience
intimated
that
she
rarely
stayed
above
a
minute
or
two
he
knew
he
knew
at
least
he
felt
perfectly
sure
that
anna
was
not
at
his
house
now
had
not
been
there
and
yet
patience
said
send
her
home
has
anna
been
here
he
asked
when
he
went
in
anna
no
not
just
that
moment
to
draw
observation
but
presently
william
left
the
room
and
went
into
the
garden
at
the
back
a
very
unpleasant
suspicion
had
arisen
in
his
mind
it
might
not
have
occurred
to
him
but
for
certain
glances
which
he
had
observed
pass
that
evening
between
herbert
dare
and
anna
glances
of
confidence
as
if
they
had
a
private
mutual
understanding
on
some
point
or
other
he
had
not
understood
them
then
he
very
much
feared
he
was
about
to
understand
them
now
opening
the
gate
leading
to
the
field
at
the
back
commonly
called
atterly
field
he
looked
cautiously
around
for
a
moment
or
two
he
could
see
nothing
the
hedge
was
thick
on
either
side
and
no
living
being
appeared
to
be
beneath
its
shade
but
he
saw
farther
when
his
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
obscurity
pacing
slowly
together
were
herbert
dare
and
anna
now
moving
on
a
few
steps
now
pausing
to
converse
more
at
ease
william
drew
a
deep
breath
he
saw
quite
enough
to
be
sure
this
was
not
the
first
time
they
had
so
paced
together
and
thought
after
thought
crowded
on
his
mind
one
idea
one
remembrance
chasing
another
was
this
the
explanation
of
the
plaid
cloak
which
had
paraded
stealthily
on
that
very
during
the
past
winter
there
could
not
be
a
doubt
of
it
and
was
it
in
this
manner
that
anna
flying
absences
from
home
were
spent
absences
which
she
in
her
unpardonable
deceit
had
accounted
for
to
patience
by
saying
that
she
was
with
halliburton
alas
for
anna
alas
for
all
who
deviate
by
an
untruth
from
the
path
of
rectitude
if
the
misguided
child
she
was
little
better
than
a
child
could
only
have
seen
the
future
that
was
before
her
it
may
have
been
very
pleasant
very
romantic
to
steal
a
march
on
patience
and
pace
out
there
in
the
cold
chattering
to
herbert
dare
listening
to
his
protestations
that
he
cared
for
no
one
in
the
world
but
herself
never
had
cared
never
should
care
but
it
was
laying
up
for
anna
a
day
of
reckoning
the
like
of
which
had
rarely
fallen
on
a
young
head
william
seemed
to
take
it
all
in
at
a
glance
and
rising
tumultuously
over
other
unpleasant
thoughts
came
the
remembrance
of
henry
misplaced
and
love
with
another
deep
breath
that
was
more
like
a
groan
than
anything
else
for
herbert
dare
never
brought
good
to
any
one
in
his
life
and
william
knew
it
william
set
off
towards
them
whether
they
heard
footsteps
or
whether
they
thought
the
time
for
parting
had
come
certain
it
was
that
herbert
was
gone
before
william
could
reach
them
and
anna
was
speeding
towards
her
home
with
a
fleet
step
william
placed
himself
in
her
way
and
she
started
aside
with
a
scream
that
went
echoing
through
the
field
then
they
had
not
heard
him
william
is
it
thee
thee
hast
frightened
me
nearly
out
of
my
senses
anna
he
gravely
said
patience
is
waiting
for
you
anna
lynn
imagination
led
her
to
all
sorts
of
fantastic
fears
oh
william
thee
hast
not
been
in
to
patience
she
exclaimed
in
sudden
trembling
thee
hast
not
been
to
our
house
to
seek
me
they
had
reached
his
gate
now
he
halted
and
took
her
hand
in
his
his
manner
impressive
his
voice
firm
anna
i
must
speak
to
you
as
i
would
to
my
own
sister
as
i
might
to
janey
had
she
lived
and
been
drawn
into
this
terrible
imprudence
though
indeed
i
should
not
then
speak
but
act
what
tales
are
they
that
herbert
dare
is
deceiving
you
with
hast
thee
been
in
to
patience
hast
thee
been
in
to
patience
reiterated
anna
patience
knows
nothing
of
this
she
thinks
you
are
at
our
house
i
ask
you
anna
what
foolish
tales
herbert
dare
is
deceiving
you
with
anna
relieved
on
the
score
of
her
fright
shook
her
head
petulantly
he
is
not
deceiving
me
with
any
he
would
not
deceive
anna
hear
me
his
very
nature
as
i
believe
is
deceit
i
fear
he
has
little
truth
little
honour
within
him
is
herbert
professing
to
to
love
you
i
will
not
answer
thee
aught
i
will
not
hear
thee
speak
against
herbert
dare
anna
he
continued
in
a
lower
tone
you
ought
to
be
of
herbert
dare
he
is
not
a
good
man
how
wilful
she
was
it
is
of
no
use
thy
talking
she
reiterated
putting
her
fingers
to
her
ears
herbert
dare
good
i
will
not
hear
thee
speak
against
him
then
anna
as
you
meet
it
in
this
way
i
must
inform
your
father
or
patience
of
what
i
have
seen
if
you
will
not
keep
yourself
out
of
harm
way
they
must
do
it
for
you
it
terrified
her
to
the
last
degree
anna
could
have
died
rather
than
suffer
her
escapade
to
reach
the
ears
of
home
how
can
thee
talk
of
harm
william
what
harm
is
likely
to
come
to
me
i
did
no
more
harm
talking
to
herbert
dare
here
than
i
did
talking
to
him
in
margaret
ashley
my
dear
child
you
do
not
understand
things
he
answered
the
very
fact
of
your
stealing
from
your
home
to
walk
about
in
this
manner
however
innocent
it
may
be
in
itself
would
do
you
incalculable
harm
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
in
no
shape
or
form
can
herbert
dare
bring
you
good
or
contribute
to
your
good
tell
me
one
thing
anna
have
you
learnt
to
care
much
for
him
i
do
care
for
him
at
all
responded
anna
no
then
why
walk
about
with
him
because
it
fun
to
cheat
patience
oh
anna
this
is
very
wrong
very
foolish
do
you
mean
what
you
say
that
you
do
not
care
for
him
of
course
i
mean
it
she
answered
i
think
he
is
very
kind
and
pleasant
and
he
gave
me
a
pretty
locket
but
that
all
william
thee
wilt
not
tell
upon
me
she
continued
clinging
to
his
arm
her
tone
changing
to
one
of
entreaty
as
the
terror
which
she
had
been
endeavouring
to
conceal
with
light
words
returned
upon
her
william
thee
art
kind
and
obliging
thee
wilt
not
tell
upon
me
i
will
promise
thee
never
to
meet
herbert
dare
again
if
thee
wilt
not
it
would
be
for
your
own
sake
anna
that
i
should
speak
how
do
i
know
that
you
would
keep
your
word
i
give
thee
my
promise
that
i
will
i
will
not
meet
herbert
dare
in
this
way
again
i
tell
thee
i
do
not
care
to
meet
him
canst
thee
not
believe
me
he
did
believe
her
implicitly
her
eyes
were
streaming
her
pretty
hands
clung
about
him
he
did
like
anna
very
much
and
he
would
not
draw
vexation
upon
her
if
it
could
be
avoided
with
expediency
i
will
rely
upon
you
then
anna
believe
me
you
could
not
choose
a
worse
friend
in
all
helstonleigh
than
herbert
dare
i
have
your
word
yes
and
i
have
thine
he
placed
her
arm
within
his
own
and
led
her
to
the
back
door
of
her
house
patience
was
standing
at
it
i
have
brought
you
the
little
truant
he
said
it
is
well
thee
hast
replied
patience
i
had
just
opened
the
door
to
come
after
her
anna
thee
art
worse
than
a
wild
thing
running
off
in
this
manner
it
had
not
been
in
william
way
to
see
much
of
anna
inner
qualities
he
had
not
detected
her
deceit
he
did
not
know
that
she
could
be
untruthful
when
it
suited
her
to
be
so
he
had
firm
faith
in
her
word
never
questioning
that
it
might
be
depended
upon
nevertheless
when
he
came
afterwards
to
reflect
upon
the
matter
he
thought
it
might
be
his
duty
to
give
patience
a
little
word
of
caution
and
this
he
could
do
without
compromising
anna
he
contrived
to
see
patience
alone
the
very
next
day
she
began
talking
of
their
previous
evening
at
the
ashleys
yes
observed
william
it
was
a
pleasant
evening
it
would
have
been
all
the
pleasanter
though
but
for
one
who
was
there
herbert
dare
i
do
not
admire
the
dares
said
patience
frigidly
nor
i
but
i
observed
one
thing
patience
that
he
admires
anna
were
anna
my
sister
i
should
not
like
her
to
be
too
much
admired
by
herbert
dare
so
take
care
of
her
patience
looked
steadily
at
him
william
continued
his
tone
confidential
you
know
what
herbert
dare
is
said
to
be
patience
fonder
of
leading
people
to
ill
than
to
good
anna
is
giddy
as
you
yourself
tell
her
twenty
times
a
day
i
would
keep
her
carefully
under
my
own
eyes
i
would
not
even
allow
her
to
run
into
our
house
at
night
as
she
is
fond
of
doing
he
added
with
marked
emphasis
she
is
as
safe
there
as
she
is
here
but
it
is
giving
her
a
taste
of
liberty
that
she
may
not
be
the
better
for
in
the
end
when
she
comes
in
send
grace
with
her
or
bring
her
yourself
i
will
see
her
home
again
tell
her
she
is
a
young
lady
now
and
it
is
not
proper
that
she
should
go
out
unattended
he
concluded
laughing
william
i
do
not
quite
understand
thee
hast
thee
cause
to
say
this
all
i
say
patience
is
keep
her
out
of
the
way
of
possible
harm
of
undesirable
friendships
were
anna
to
be
drawn
into
a
liking
for
herbert
dare
i
am
sure
it
would
not
be
agreeable
to
lynn
he
would
never
consider
the
dares
a
desirable
family
for
her
to
marry
into
marry
into
the
family
of
the
dares
interrupted
patience
hotly
art
thee
losing
thy
senses
william
these
likings
sometimes
lead
to
marriage
quietly
continued
william
therefore
i
say
keep
her
away
from
all
chance
of
forming
them
believe
me
my
advice
is
good
i
think
i
understand
concluded
patience
i
thank
thee
kindly
william
chapter
xxiv
anna
excuse
a
very
unpleasant
part
of
the
story
has
now
to
be
touched
upon
unpleasant
things
occur
in
real
life
and
if
true
pictures
have
to
be
given
of
the
world
as
it
exists
as
it
goes
on
its
round
day
by
day
allusion
to
them
can
not
be
wholly
avoided
certain
words
of
william
halliburton
to
patience
had
run
in
this
fashion
were
anna
to
be
drawn
into
a
liking
for
herbert
dare
i
am
sure
it
would
not
be
agreeable
to
lynn
he
would
never
consider
the
dares
a
desirable
family
for
her
to
marry
into
in
thus
speaking
william
had
striven
to
put
the
case
in
a
polite
sort
of
form
to
the
ears
of
patience
as
to
any
probability
of
marriage
between
one
of
the
dares
and
anna
lynn
he
would
scarcely
have
believed
it
within
the
range
of
possibility
the
dares
one
and
all
would
have
considered
anna
far
beneath
them
in
position
whilst
the
difference
of
religion
would
on
anna
side
be
an
almost
insurmountable
objection
the
worst
that
william
had
contemplated
was
the
liking
he
had
hinted
at
he
cared
for
anna
welfare
as
he
would
have
cared
for
a
sister
and
he
believed
it
would
not
contribute
to
her
happiness
that
she
should
become
attached
to
herbert
dare
but
for
compromising
anna
and
he
had
given
his
word
not
to
do
it
he
would
have
spoken
out
openly
and
said
there
was
a
danger
of
this
liking
coming
to
pass
if
she
met
him
as
he
feared
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
certainly
he
would
not
have
alluded
to
the
remote
possibility
of
marriage
the
mention
of
which
had
so
scared
patience
what
had
william
thought
what
had
patience
said
could
they
have
known
that
this
liking
was
already
implanted
in
anna
heart
beyond
recall
alas
that
it
should
have
been
so
quiet
childish
timid
as
anna
outwardly
appeared
the
strongest
affection
had
been
aroused
in
her
heart
for
herbert
dare
was
filling
its
every
crevice
these
apparently
shy
sensitive
natures
are
sometimes
only
the
more
passionate
and
wayward
within
one
evening
a
few
months
previously
anna
was
walking
in
atterly
field
behind
their
house
anna
had
been
in
the
habit
of
walking
there
nay
of
playing
there
since
she
was
a
child
and
she
would
as
soon
have
associated
harm
with
their
garden
as
with
that
field
farmer
atterly
kept
his
sheep
in
it
and
anna
had
run
about
with
the
lambs
as
long
as
she
could
remember
herbert
dare
came
up
accidentally
the
path
through
it
leading
along
at
the
back
of
the
houses
was
public
though
not
much
frequented
and
he
spoke
to
anna
anna
knew
him
to
say
good
day
when
she
passed
him
in
the
street
and
she
now
and
then
saw
him
at
ashley
herbert
stayed
talking
with
her
a
few
minutes
and
then
went
on
his
way
somehow
from
that
time
he
and
anna
encountered
each
other
there
pretty
frequently
and
that
was
how
the
liking
had
grown
if
a
qualm
of
conscience
crossed
miss
anna
at
times
that
it
was
not
quite
the
thing
for
a
young
lady
to
do
thus
to
meet
a
gentleman
in
secret
she
conveniently
put
the
qualm
away
that
harm
should
arise
from
it
in
any
way
never
so
much
as
crossed
her
mind
for
a
moment
and
to
do
herbert
dare
justice
real
harm
was
probably
as
far
from
his
mind
as
from
hers
he
grew
to
like
her
almost
as
she
liked
him
herbert
dare
did
not
in
the
sight
of
helstonleigh
stand
out
as
a
model
of
all
the
cardinal
virtues
but
he
was
not
all
bad
anna
believed
him
all
good
all
honour
truth
excellence
and
her
heart
had
flashed
out
a
rebuke
to
william
when
he
hinted
that
herbert
was
not
exactly
a
paragon
she
only
knew
that
the
very
sound
of
his
footstep
made
her
heart
leap
with
happiness
she
only
knew
that
to
her
he
appeared
everything
that
was
bright
and
fascinating
her
great
dread
was
lest
their
intimacy
should
become
known
and
separation
ensue
that
separation
would
be
inevitable
were
her
father
or
patience
to
become
cognizant
of
it
anna
rightly
believed
cunning
little
sophist
that
she
was
she
would
fain
persuade
herself
that
an
innocent
meeting
out
of
doors
was
justifiable
where
a
meeting
indoors
was
out
of
the
question
they
had
no
acquaintance
with
the
dares
consequently
herbert
could
plead
no
excuse
for
calling
in
upon
them
none
at
least
that
would
be
likely
to
carry
weight
with
patience
and
so
the
young
lady
reconciled
her
conscience
in
the
best
way
she
could
stole
out
as
often
as
she
was
able
to
meet
him
and
left
discovery
to
take
care
of
itself
discovery
came
in
the
shape
of
william
halliburton
it
was
bad
enough
but
far
less
alarming
to
anna
than
it
might
have
been
had
her
father
dropped
upon
her
she
would
have
run
away
and
fallen
into
the
nearest
pond
in
her
terror
and
consternation
though
guilty
of
certain
trifling
inaccuracies
such
as
protesting
that
she
did
not
care
for
herbert
dare
anna
in
that
interview
with
william
fully
meant
to
keep
the
promise
she
made
not
to
meet
him
again
promises
however
given
under
the
influence
of
terror
or
other
sudden
emotion
are
not
always
kept
it
would
probably
prove
so
with
anna
one
thing
was
indisputable
that
where
a
mind
could
so
far
forget
its
moral
rectitude
as
to
practise
deceit
in
one
particular
as
anna
was
doing
it
would
not
be
very
scrupulous
to
keep
its
better
promises
anna
thoughts
for
many
a
morning
latterly
when
she
arose
had
been
this
evening
i
shall
see
him
and
the
prospect
seemed
to
quicken
her
fingers
as
it
quickened
her
heart
but
on
the
morning
after
the
discovery
her
first
thought
was
i
must
never
see
him
again
as
i
have
done
how
shall
i
warn
him
not
to
come
that
he
would
be
in
the
field
again
that
evening
unless
warned
she
knew
if
william
halliburton
saw
him
there
a
quarrel
might
ensue
between
them
at
any
rate
an
unpleasant
scene
anna
came
down
feeling
cross
and
petulant
and
inclined
to
wish
william
had
been
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
before
he
had
found
them
out
the
previous
evening
where
there
a
will
there
a
way
it
is
said
anna
lynn
contrived
that
day
to
exemplify
it
her
will
was
set
upon
seeing
herbert
dare
and
she
did
see
him
it
can
scarcely
be
said
by
accident
anna
contrived
to
be
sent
into
the
town
by
patience
on
an
errand
and
she
managed
to
linger
so
long
in
the
neighbourhood
of
dare
office
gazing
in
at
the
shops
in
west
street
if
patience
had
only
seen
her
that
herbert
dare
passed
anna
herbert
i
have
been
waiting
in
the
hope
of
seeing
thee
she
whispered
her
manner
timid
as
a
fawn
her
pretty
cheeks
blushing
thee
must
not
come
again
in
the
evening
for
i
can
not
meet
thee
why
so
asked
herbert
william
halliburton
saw
me
with
thee
last
night
and
he
says
it
is
not
right
i
had
to
give
him
my
promise
not
to
meet
thee
again
or
he
would
have
told
my
father
herbert
cast
a
word
to
william
not
a
complimentary
one
what
business
is
it
of
his
he
asked
i
dare
not
stay
talking
to
thee
herbert
patience
will
likely
be
sending
grace
after
me
finding
me
so
long
away
but
i
was
obliged
to
tell
thee
this
lest
thee
should
be
coming
again
fare
thee
well
passing
swiftly
from
him
anna
went
on
her
way
herbert
did
not
choose
to
follow
her
in
the
open
street
she
went
along
poor
child
with
her
head
down
and
her
eyelashes
glistening
it
was
little
else
than
bitter
sorrow
thus
to
part
with
herbert
dare
patience
was
standing
at
the
door
looking
out
for
her
when
she
came
in
sight
of
home
patience
had
given
little
heed
to
what
william
halliburton
had
said
the
previous
night
or
she
might
not
have
sent
anna
into
helstonleigh
alone
in
point
of
fact
patience
had
thought
william
a
little
fanciful
but
when
instead
of
being
home
at
four
as
she
ought
to
have
been
the
clock
struck
five
and
she
had
not
made
her
appearance
patience
began
to
think
she
did
let
her
have
too
much
liberty
now
where
hast
thee
been
was
patience
salutation
delivered
in
icy
tones
i
met
so
many
people
patience
they
stayed
to
talk
with
me
brushing
past
patience
deaf
to
her
subsequent
reproofs
anna
flew
up
to
her
own
room
when
she
came
down
her
father
had
entered
and
patience
was
pouring
out
the
tea
wilt
thee
tell
thy
father
where
thee
hast
been
the
command
was
delivered
in
patience
driest
tone
anna
inwardly
tormented
outwardly
vexed
burst
into
tears
the
quaker
looked
up
in
surprise
patience
explained
anna
had
left
home
at
three
to
execute
a
little
commission
she
might
well
have
been
home
in
of
an
hour
and
she
had
only
made
her
appearance
now
what
kept
thee
child
asked
her
father
i
only
looked
in
at
a
shop
or
two
pleaded
anna
through
her
tears
there
were
the
prettiest
new
engravings
in
at
thomas
woakam
if
patience
had
wanted
me
to
run
both
ways
she
should
have
said
so
notwithstanding
the
little
spice
of
impertinence
peeping
out
in
the
last
sentence
samuel
lynn
saw
no
reason
to
correct
anna
that
she
could
ever
be
wrong
he
scarcely
admitted
to
his
own
heart
dry
thy
tears
child
and
take
thy
tea
said
he
patience
wanted
thee
maybe
for
some
household
matter
it
can
wait
another
opportunity
patience
he
added
as
if
to
drown
the
sound
of
his
words
and
their
remembrance
are
my
shirts
in
order
thy
shirts
in
order
repeated
patience
why
dost
thee
ask
that
i
should
not
have
asked
it
without
reason
returned
he
wilt
thee
please
give
me
an
answer
the
old
shirts
are
as
much
in
order
as
things
beginning
to
wear
can
be
replied
patience
thy
new
shirts
i
can
not
say
much
about
they
will
not
be
finished
this
side
midsummer
unless
anna
sits
to
them
a
little
closer
than
she
is
doing
now
thy
shirts
will
be
ready
quite
in
time
father
before
the
old
ones
are
gone
beyond
wearing
spoke
up
anna
i
do
know
that
said
lynn
had
they
been
ready
child
i
might
have
wanted
them
now
i
am
going
a
journey
is
it
the
french
journey
thee
hast
talked
of
once
or
twice
lately
interposed
patience
yes
said
samuel
lynn
the
master
was
speaking
to
me
about
it
this
afternoon
we
were
interrupted
and
i
did
not
altogether
gather
when
he
wishes
me
to
start
but
i
fancy
it
will
be
immediately
oh
father
couldst
thee
not
take
me
the
interruption
came
from
anna
her
blue
eyes
were
glistening
her
cheeks
were
crimson
a
journey
to
the
interior
of
france
wore
charms
for
her
as
great
as
it
did
for
cyril
dare
all
the
way
home
from
west
street
she
had
been
thinking
how
she
should
spend
her
miserable
home
days
debarred
of
the
evening
snatches
of
herbert
charming
society
going
to
france
would
be
something
i
wish
i
could
take
thee
child
but
thee
art
aware
thee
might
as
well
ask
me
to
take
the
malvern
hills
in
her
inward
conviction
anna
believed
she
might
before
she
could
oppose
any
answering
but
most
useless
argument
samuel
lynn
attention
was
directed
to
the
road
parting
opposite
to
his
house
as
if
they
had
just
walked
together
from
the
manufactory
were
ashley
and
william
halliburton
the
master
walked
on
william
catching
samuel
lynn
eye
came
across
and
entered
ashley
had
been
telling
william
some
news
though
no
vacillating
man
in
a
general
way
it
appeared
that
he
had
again
reconsidered
his
determination
with
regard
to
despatching
william
to
france
he
had
come
to
the
resolve
to
send
him
as
well
as
samuel
lynn
william
could
not
help
surmising
that
his
betrayed
emotion
the
previous
night
his
fears
touching
ashley
reason
for
not
sending
him
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
that
gentleman
change
of
mind
will
you
be
troubled
with
me
asked
he
of
lynn
when
he
had
imparted
this
to
him
if
such
be
the
master
fiat
i
can
not
help
being
troubled
with
thee
was
the
answer
of
samuel
lynn
but
the
tone
of
his
voice
spoke
of
anything
rather
than
dissatisfaction
why
is
he
sending
thee
as
well
as
myself
he
told
me
he
thought
it
might
be
best
that
you
should
show
me
the
markets
and
introduce
me
to
the
skin
merchants
as
i
should
probably
have
to
make
the
journey
alone
in
future
replied
william
i
had
no
idea
until
the
master
mentioned
it
now
that
you
had
ever
made
the
journey
yourself
lynn
you
never
told
me
there
was
nothing
that
i
am
aware
of
to
call
for
the
information
observed
the
quaker
in
his
usual
dry
manner
i
went
there
two
or
three
times
on
my
own
account
when
i
was
in
business
for
myself
did
the
master
tell
thee
when
he
should
expect
us
to
start
not
precisely
the
beginning
of
the
week
i
think
i
have
been
asking
my
father
if
he
can
not
take
me
put
in
anna
in
plaintive
tones
looking
at
william
and
i
have
answered
her
that
she
may
as
well
ask
me
to
take
the
malvern
hills
was
the
rejoinder
of
samuel
lynn
i
could
as
likely
take
the
one
as
the
other
likely
or
unlikely
samuel
lynn
would
have
taken
her
beyond
all
doubt
taken
her
with
a
greedy
sheltering
grasp
had
he
foreseen
the
result
of
leaving
her
at
home
the
grievous
trouble
that
was
to
fall
upon
her
head
thee
wilt
drink
a
dish
of
tea
with
us
this
evening
william
it
was
patience
who
spoke
william
hesitated
but
he
saw
they
would
be
pleased
at
his
doing
so
and
he
sat
down
the
conversation
turned
upon
france
upon
samuel
lynn
experiences
and
william
anticipations
anna
lapsed
into
silence
and
abstraction
in
the
bustle
of
moving
when
samuel
lynn
was
departing
for
the
manufactory
william
before
going
home
to
his
books
contrived
to
obtain
a
word
alone
with
anna
have
you
thought
of
our
compact
yes
she
said
freely
meeting
his
eyes
in
honest
truth
i
saw
him
this
afternoon
in
the
street
i
went
on
purpose
to
try
and
meet
him
he
will
not
come
again
that
is
well
mind
and
take
care
of
yourself
anna
he
added
with
a
smile
i
shall
be
away
and
not
able
to
give
an
eye
to
you
as
i
freely
confess
it
had
been
my
resolve
to
do
anna
shook
her
head
he
does
not
come
again
she
repeated
thee
may
go
away
believing
me
william
and
william
did
go
away
believing
her
went
away
to
france
putting
faith
in
her
thinking
that
the
undesirable
intimacy
was
at
an
end
for
ever
chapter
xxv
patience
come
to
grief
in
the
early
part
of
march
samuel
lynn
and
william
departed
on
their
journey
to
france
and
the
first
thought
that
occurred
to
patience
afterwards
was
one
that
is
apt
to
occur
to
many
thrifty
housekeepers
on
the
absence
of
the
master
that
of
instituting
a
thorough
cleansing
of
the
house
from
garret
to
cellar
or
as
anna
mischievously
expressed
it
turning
the
house
inside
out
she
knew
patience
did
not
like
her
wild
phrases
and
therefore
she
used
them
patience
was
parting
with
grace
the
servant
who
had
been
with
them
so
many
years
grace
had
resolved
to
get
married
in
vain
patience
assured
her
that
marriage
generally
speaking
was
found
to
be
nothing
better
than
a
bed
of
thorns
grace
would
not
listen
others
had
risked
the
thorns
before
her
and
she
thought
she
must
try
her
chance
with
the
rest
patience
had
no
resource
but
to
fall
in
with
the
decision
and
to
look
out
for
another
servant
it
appeared
that
she
could
not
readily
find
one
at
least
one
whom
she
would
venture
to
engage
she
was
unusually
particular
and
while
she
waited
and
looked
out
she
engaged
hester
dell
a
humble
member
of
her
own
persuasion
to
come
in
temporarily
hester
lived
with
her
aged
mother
not
far
off
chiefly
supporting
herself
by
doing
fine
needlework
at
her
own
or
at
the
friends
houses
she
readily
consented
to
take
up
her
abode
with
patience
for
a
month
or
so
to
help
with
the
housework
and
looked
upon
it
as
a
sort
of
holiday
it
of
no
use
to
begin
the
house
until
grace
shall
be
gone
observed
patience
to
anna
she
likely
be
scrubbing
the
paper
on
the
walls
instead
of
the
paint
for
her
head
is
turned
just
now
what
fun
if
she
should
ejaculated
anna
fun
for
thee
perhaps
who
art
ignorant
of
cost
and
labour
rebuked
patience
i
shall
wait
until
grace
has
departed
the
day
that
she
goes
hester
comes
in
and
i
shall
have
the
house
begun
the
day
following
could
thee
have
it
begun
the
same
day
saucily
asked
anna
will
thee
attend
to
thy
stitching
returned
patience
sharply
thy
father
wristbands
will
not
be
done
the
better
for
thy
nonsense
shall
i
be
turned
out
of
my
bedroom
resumed
anna
for
a
night
perchance
thee
canst
go
into
thy
father
but
the
top
of
the
house
will
be
done
first
is
the
roof
to
be
scrubbed
went
on
anna
i
do
know
how
hester
will
hold
on
while
she
does
it
thee
art
in
one
of
thy
wilful
humours
this
morning
responded
patience
art
thee
going
to
set
me
at
defiance
now
thy
father
back
is
turned
who
said
anything
about
setting
thee
at
defiance
asked
anna
i
like
to
see
hester
scrubbing
the
roof
thee
hadst
better
behave
thyself
anna
was
the
retort
of
patience
and
anna
in
her
lighthearted
wilfulness
burst
into
a
merry
laugh
grace
departed
and
hester
came
in
a
quiet
little
body
of
forty
years
with
dark
hair
and
defective
teeth
patience
as
good
as
her
word
was
up
betimes
the
following
morning
and
had
the
house
up
betimes
to
institute
the
ceremony
their
house
contained
the
same
accommodation
as
halliburton
with
this
addition
that
the
garret
in
the
quaker
had
been
partitioned
off
into
two
chambers
patience
slept
in
one
grace
had
occupied
the
other
the
three
bedrooms
on
the
floor
beneath
were
used
one
by
lynn
one
by
anna
the
other
was
kept
as
a
spare
room
for
any
chance
visitor
the
best
room
it
was
usually
called
the
house
belonged
to
lynn
formerly
both
houses
had
belonged
to
him
but
at
the
time
of
his
loss
he
had
sold
the
other
to
ashley
the
ablutions
were
in
full
play
hester
with
a
pail
mop
and
other
essentials
was
ensconced
in
the
top
chambers
anna
ostensibly
at
her
wristband
stitching
but
the
work
did
not
get
on
very
fast
was
singing
to
herself
in
an
undertone
in
one
of
the
parlours
the
door
safely
shut
while
patience
was
exercising
a
general
superintendence
giving
an
eye
everywhere
suddenly
there
echoed
a
loud
noise
as
of
a
fall
and
a
scream
resounded
throughout
the
house
it
appeared
to
come
from
what
they
usually
called
the
bedroom
floor
anna
flew
up
the
stairs
and
hester
dell
flew
down
the
upper
ones
at
the
foot
of
the
garret
stairs
her
head
against
the
door
of
chamber
lay
patience
and
a
heavy
in
attempting
to
carry
the
pole
down
from
her
room
she
had
somehow
overbalanced
herself
and
fallen
heavily
is
the
house
coming
down
anna
was
beginning
to
say
but
she
stopped
in
consternation
when
she
saw
patience
hester
attempted
to
pick
her
up
thee
can
not
raise
me
hester
anna
child
thee
must
not
attempt
to
touch
me
i
fear
my
leg
is
br
her
voice
died
away
her
eyes
closed
and
a
hue
as
of
death
overspread
her
countenance
anna
more
terrified
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
flew
round
to
halliburton
dobbs
from
her
kitchen
saw
her
coming
saw
the
young
face
streaming
with
tears
heard
the
short
cries
of
alarm
and
dobbs
stepped
out
why
what
on
earth
the
matter
now
asked
she
anna
seized
dobbs
and
clung
to
her
partly
that
to
do
so
seemed
some
protection
in
her
great
terror
oh
dobbs
come
in
to
patience
she
cried
i
think
she
dying
the
voice
reached
the
ears
of
jane
she
came
forth
from
the
parlour
dobbs
was
then
running
in
to
samuel
lynn
and
jane
ran
also
understanding
nothing
patience
was
reviving
when
they
entered
all
her
cry
was
that
they
must
not
move
her
one
of
her
legs
was
in
some
manner
doubled
under
her
and
doubled
over
the
pole
jane
felt
a
conviction
that
it
was
broken
who
can
run
fastest
she
asked
we
must
have
parry
here
hester
waited
for
no
further
instruction
she
caught
up
her
quaker
shawl
and
grey
bonnet
and
was
off
putting
them
on
as
she
ran
anna
sobbing
wildly
turned
and
hid
her
face
on
jane
as
one
who
wants
to
be
comforted
then
her
mood
changing
she
threw
herself
down
beside
patience
the
tears
from
her
own
eyes
falling
on
patience
face
patience
dear
patience
canst
thee
forgive
me
i
have
been
wilful
and
naughty
but
i
never
meant
to
cross
thee
really
i
did
it
only
to
tease
thee
but
i
loved
thee
all
the
while
patience
suffering
as
she
was
drew
down
the
repentant
face
to
kiss
it
fervently
i
know
it
dear
child
i
know
thee
do
thee
distress
thyself
for
me
parry
came
and
patience
was
carried
into
the
spare
room
her
leg
was
broken
and
badly
broken
the
surgeon
called
it
a
compound
fracture
so
there
was
an
end
to
the
grand
cleansing
scheme
for
a
long
time
to
come
patience
lay
in
sickness
and
pain
and
hester
had
to
make
her
her
first
care
anna
spirits
revived
in
a
day
or
two
parry
said
a
cure
would
be
effected
in
time
that
the
worst
of
the
business
was
the
long
confinement
for
patience
and
anna
forgot
her
dutiful
fit
of
repentance
patience
be
well
again
would
be
about
as
before
and
as
to
the
present
confinement
anna
rather
grew
to
look
upon
it
as
the
interposition
of
some
good
fairy
who
must
have
taken
her
own
liberty
under
its
special
protection
whether
anna
would
have
succeeded
in
eluding
the
vigilance
of
patience
can
not
be
told
she
certainly
did
that
of
patience
anna
had
told
herbert
dare
that
he
was
not
to
pay
a
visit
to
atterly
field
again
or
expect
her
to
pay
one
but
herbert
dare
was
about
the
last
person
to
obey
such
advice
had
william
halliburton
remained
to
be
as
herbert
termed
it
a
treacherous
spy
there
no
doubt
that
herbert
would
have
striven
to
set
his
vigilance
at
defiance
with
absence
the
field
both
literally
and
figuratively
was
open
to
him
in
the
absence
of
samuel
lynn
it
was
doubly
open
herbert
dare
knew
perfectly
well
that
if
the
quaker
once
gained
the
slightest
inkling
of
his
secret
acquaintance
with
anna
it
would
effectually
be
put
a
stop
to
to
wear
a
cloak
resembling
william
halliburton
on
his
visits
to
the
field
had
been
the
result
of
a
bright
idea
it
had
suddenly
occurred
to
herbert
that
if
the
quaker
lynx
eyes
did
by
mischance
catch
sight
of
the
cloak
promenading
some
fine
night
at
the
back
of
his
residence
they
would
accord
it
no
particular
notice
concluding
the
wearer
to
be
william
halliburton
taking
a
moonlight
stroll
at
the
back
of
residence
nevertheless
herbert
had
timed
his
visits
so
as
to
make
pretty
sure
that
samuel
lynn
was
out
of
view
safely
ensconced
in
ashley
manufactory
and
he
had
generally
succeeded
not
quite
always
as
the
reader
knows
anna
was
of
a
most
persuadable
nature
in
defiance
of
her
promise
to
william
she
suffered
herbert
dare
to
persuade
her
again
into
the
old
system
of
meeting
him
guileless
as
a
child
never
giving
thought
to
wrong
or
to
harm
beyond
the
wrong
and
harm
of
thus
clandestinely
stealing
out
and
that
wrong
she
conveniently
ignored
she
saw
nothing
very
grave
in
doing
it
herbert
could
not
come
indoors
patience
would
be
sure
not
to
welcome
him
and
therefore
she
logically
argued
to
her
own
mind
she
must
go
out
to
him
she
had
learnt
to
like
herbert
dare
a
great
deal
too
well
not
to
wish
to
meet
him
to
talk
with
him
herbert
on
his
part
had
learnt
to
like
her
an
hour
passed
in
whispering
to
anna
in
mischievously
untying
her
sober
cap
and
letting
the
curls
fall
in
laying
his
own
hand
fondly
on
the
young
head
and
telling
her
he
cared
for
her
beyond
every
earthly
thing
it
had
grown
to
be
one
of
his
most
favourite
recreations
and
herbert
was
not
one
to
deny
himself
any
recreation
that
he
took
a
fancy
to
he
intended
no
harm
to
the
pretty
child
it
is
possible
that
had
any
one
seriously
pointed
out
to
him
the
harm
that
might
arise
to
anna
in
the
estimation
of
helstonleigh
should
these
stolen
meetings
be
found
out
herbert
might
for
once
have
done
violence
to
his
inclinations
and
not
have
persisted
in
them
unfortunately
very
unfortunately
as
it
was
to
turn
out
there
was
no
one
to
give
this
word
of
caution
patience
was
ill
william
was
away
and
no
one
else
knew
anything
about
it
in
point
of
fact
patience
could
not
be
said
to
know
anything
for
warning
had
not
made
the
impression
upon
her
that
it
ought
to
have
done
patience
confiding
nature
was
in
fault
for
anna
deliberately
to
meet
herbert
dare
or
any
other
herbert
in
secret
she
would
have
deemed
a
simple
impossibility
in
the
judgment
of
patience
it
had
been
nothing
less
than
irredeemable
sin
what
did
herbert
dare
promise
himself
in
thus
leading
anna
into
this
imprudence
herbert
promised
himself
nothing
beyond
the
passing
gratification
of
the
hour
herbert
had
never
been
one
to
give
any
care
to
the
future
for
himself
or
for
any
one
else
and
he
was
not
likely
to
begin
to
do
it
at
present
as
to
seeking
anna
for
his
wife
such
a
thought
had
never
crossed
his
mind
in
the
first
place
at
the
rate
the
dares
herbert
and
his
brothers
were
going
on
a
wife
for
any
of
them
seemed
amongst
the
impossibilities
unless
indeed
she
made
the
bargain
beforehand
to
live
upon
air
there
was
no
chance
of
their
having
anything
else
to
live
upon
but
had
herbert
been
in
a
position
pecuniarily
considered
to
marry
ten
wives
anna
lynn
would
not
have
been
one
of
them
agreeable
as
it
might
be
to
him
to
linger
with
anna
he
considered
her
far
beneath
himself
and
pride
with
herbert
was
always
in
the
ascendant
herbert
had
been
introduced
to
anna
lynn
at
ashley
and
that
threw
a
sort
of
prestige
around
her
she
was
also
enshrined
in
the
respectable
quaker
body
of
the
town
but
for
these
facts
for
being
who
she
was
herbert
might
have
been
less
scrupulous
in
his
behaviour
towards
her
he
would
not
it
may
be
as
well
to
say
he
dared
not
be
otherwise
than
considerate
towards
anna
lynn
but
on
the
other
hand
he
would
not
have
considered
her
worthy
to
become
his
wife
on
the
part
of
samuel
lynn
he
would
far
rather
have
seen
his
child
in
her
coffin
than
the
wife
of
herbert
dare
the
young
dares
did
not
bear
a
good
name
in
helstonleigh
in
this
most
uncertain
and
unsatisfactory
state
of
things
what
on
earth
as
dobbs
had
said
to
anna
did
herbert
want
with
her
at
all
far
far
better
that
he
had
allowed
anna
to
fall
in
with
the
sensible
advice
of
william
halliburton
do
not
meet
him
again
it
was
a
sad
pity
and
it
is
very
probable
that
herbert
dare
regretted
it
afterwards
in
the
grievous
misery
it
entailed
misery
to
both
and
without
positive
ill
conduct
on
the
part
of
either
but
that
time
has
not
yet
come
and
we
are
only
at
the
stage
of
samuel
lynn
absence
and
patience
broken
leg
anna
had
taken
to
stealing
out
again
and
her
wits
were
at
work
to
concoct
a
plausible
excuse
for
her
absences
to
hester
dell
that
no
tales
might
be
carried
to
patience
hester
patience
is
a
fidget
thee
must
see
that
she
would
like
me
to
keep
at
my
work
all
day
all
day
evening
too
and
never
have
a
breath
of
fresh
air
she
like
me
to
shut
myself
up
in
this
parlour
as
she
has
now
to
be
shut
up
in
her
room
never
to
be
in
the
garden
in
the
lovely
twilight
never
to
run
and
look
at
the
pretty
lambs
in
the
field
never
to
go
next
door
and
say
dost
thee
to
jane
halliburton
it
a
shame
hester
well
i
think
it
would
be
if
it
were
true
responded
hester
a
simple
woman
in
mind
and
language
who
loved
anna
almost
as
well
as
did
patience
but
dost
thee
not
think
thee
art
mistaken
child
patience
seems
anxious
that
thee
should
go
out
she
says
i
am
to
take
thee
i
dare
say
responded
anna
and
leave
her
all
alone
how
would
she
come
downstairs
with
her
broken
leg
if
any
one
knocked
at
the
door
she
a
dreadful
fidget
hester
she
like
to
watch
me
as
a
cat
watches
a
mouse
look
at
last
night
it
all
on
account
of
these
shirts
she
thinks
i
sha
get
them
done
i
shall
why
dear
i
think
thee
wilt
returned
hester
casting
her
eyes
on
the
work
thee
art
getting
on
with
them
i
am
getting
on
nicely
i
have
done
all
the
stitching
and
nearly
the
plain
part
of
the
bodies
i
shall
soon
be
at
the
gathers
what
did
she
say
to
thee
last
night
she
said
to
the
parlour
hester
and
see
whether
anna
does
not
want
a
light
and
i
came
and
could
not
find
thee
and
then
she
said
thee
wast
always
running
into
the
next
door
troubling
them
and
she
would
not
have
it
done
thee
came
in
just
at
the
time
and
she
scolded
thee
yes
she
did
resentfully
spoke
anna
i
tell
thee
hester
she
the
worst
fidget
breathing
i
give
thee
my
word
hester
that
i
had
not
been
inside
the
halliburtons
door
i
had
been
in
this
garden
and
in
the
field
i
had
been
close
at
work
all
day
not
quite
all
day
dear
interrupted
hester
willing
to
smooth
matters
to
the
child
as
far
as
she
was
able
thee
hadst
thy
friend
mary
ashley
here
to
call
in
the
morning
and
thee
hadst
sarah
dixon
in
the
afternoon
well
i
had
been
at
work
a
good
part
of
the
day
corrected
anna
and
i
wanted
some
fresh
air
after
it
where
the
crime
crime
dear
it
only
natural
if
i
had
not
my
errands
to
go
upon
and
so
take
the
air
that
way
i
should
like
myself
to
run
to
the
field
when
my
work
was
done
so
would
any
one
else
except
patience
retorted
anna
hester
look
thee
when
she
asks
after
me
again
thee
hast
no
need
to
tell
her
should
i
have
run
out
it
only
fidgets
her
and
she
is
not
well
enough
to
be
fidgeted
thee
tell
her
i
am
at
my
sewing
but
i
be
sewing
for
ever
hester
i
must
have
a
few
minutes
holiday
from
it
now
and
then
patience
might
have
cause
to
grumble
if
i
ran
away
and
left
it
in
the
day
well
dear
i
think
it
is
only
reasonable
slowly
answered
hester
considering
the
matter
over
i
not
tell
her
thee
art
in
the
garden
again
for
she
must
be
kept
tranquil
friend
parry
says
she
was
just
as
bad
when
i
was
a
little
girl
hester
concluded
anna
she
would
let
me
run
in
the
garden
alone
then
for
fear
i
should
eat
the
gooseberries
but
it
is
not
the
gooseberry
season
now
all
quite
true
and
reasonable
thought
hester
dell
and
so
the
young
lady
contrived
to
enjoy
a
fair
share
of
evening
liberty
not
but
that
she
would
have
done
with
more
had
she
known
how
to
get
it
and
as
the
weeks
went
on
and
the
cold
weather
of
early
spring
merged
into
summer
days
more
genial
nights
she
and
herbert
dare
grew
bold
in
their
immunity
from
discovery
and
scarcely
an
evening
passed
but
they
might
have
been
seen
had
any
one
been
on
the
watch
in
farmer
atterly
field
anna
had
reached
the
point
of
taking
his
arm
now
and
there
they
would
pace
under
cover
of
the
hedge
herbert
talking
and
anna
dreaming
that
she
was
in
eden
chapter
xxvi
the
governess
expedition
herbert
dare
sat
enjoying
the
beauty
of
the
april
evening
in
the
garden
of
pomeranian
knoll
he
was
hoisted
on
the
back
of
a
garden
bench
and
balanced
himself
astride
it
the
tip
of
one
toe
resting
on
the
seat
the
other
foot
dangling
the
month
was
drawing
to
its
close
and
the
beams
of
the
setting
sun
streamed
athwart
herbert
face
it
might
be
supposed
that
he
had
seated
himself
there
to
bask
in
the
soft
still
air
and
lovely
sunset
in
point
of
fact
he
hardly
knew
whether
the
sun
was
rising
or
setting
whether
the
evening
was
fair
or
foul
so
buried
was
he
in
deep
thought
and
perplexing
care
the
particular
care
which
was
troubling
herbert
dare
was
one
which
has
at
some
time
or
other
troubled
the
peace
of
a
great
many
of
us
it
was
pecuniary
embarrassment
herbert
had
been
in
it
for
a
long
time
had
in
fact
been
sinking
into
it
deeper
and
deeper
he
had
managed
to
ward
it
off
hitherto
in
some
way
or
other
but
the
time
to
do
that
much
longer
was
going
by
he
was
not
given
to
forethought
it
has
been
previously
mentioned
but
he
could
not
conceal
from
himself
that
unpleasantness
would
ensue
and
that
speedily
unless
something
could
be
done
what
was
that
something
to
be
he
did
not
know
he
could
not
imagine
his
father
protested
that
he
had
not
the
means
to
help
him
and
herbert
believed
that
dare
spoke
the
truth
not
that
dare
knew
of
the
extent
of
the
embarrassment
had
he
done
so
it
would
have
come
to
the
same
thing
so
far
as
his
help
went
his
sons
as
he
said
had
drained
him
to
the
utmost
anthony
passed
the
end
of
the
walk
whether
he
saw
herbert
or
not
certain
it
was
that
he
turned
away
from
his
direction
herbert
lifted
his
eyes
an
angry
light
in
them
he
lifted
his
voice
also
angry
too
here
you
do
go
skulking
off
because
you
see
me
sitting
here
i
want
you
anthony
was
taken
to
it
is
more
than
probable
that
he
skulking
off
and
that
he
seen
herbert
for
he
did
not
particularly
care
then
to
come
into
contact
with
his
brother
anthony
was
in
embarrassment
on
his
own
score
was
ill
at
ease
from
more
reasons
than
one
and
when
the
mind
is
troubled
sharp
words
do
not
tend
to
soothe
it
little
else
than
sharp
words
had
been
exchanged
latterly
between
anthony
and
herbert
dare
it
was
no
temporary
vexed
pleased
which
had
grown
up
between
them
the
had
existed
a
long
time
herbert
believed
that
his
brother
had
injured
him
had
wilfully
played
him
false
and
his
heart
bitterly
resented
it
that
anthony
was
in
fault
at
the
beginning
was
undoubted
he
had
drawn
herbert
unsuspiciously
unsuspiciously
on
herbert
part
you
understand
into
some
mess
with
regard
to
bills
anthony
was
fond
of
bills
herbert
more
wise
in
that
respect
had
never
meddled
with
them
his
opinion
coincided
with
his
father
they
were
edged
tools
which
cut
both
ways
eschew
bills
if
you
want
to
die
upon
your
own
bed
was
a
saying
of
dare
frequently
uttered
for
the
benefit
of
his
sons
good
advice
no
doubt
dare
as
a
lawyer
ought
to
know
herbert
had
held
by
the
advice
anthony
never
had
and
the
time
came
when
anthony
took
care
that
his
brother
should
not
in
a
period
of
deep
embarrassment
for
anthony
he
had
persuaded
herbert
to
sign
two
bills
for
him
their
aggregate
amount
being
large
assuring
him
in
the
most
earnest
and
apparently
truthful
manner
that
the
money
to
meet
them
when
due
was
already
provided
herbert
in
his
good
nature
fell
into
the
snare
it
turned
out
not
only
that
the
bills
were
not
met
at
all
but
anthony
had
so
contrived
it
that
herbert
should
be
responsible
not
he
himself
herbert
regarded
it
as
a
shameful
piece
of
treachery
and
never
ceased
to
reproach
his
brother
anthony
who
was
of
a
sullen
morose
temper
resented
the
reproach
and
they
did
not
lead
together
the
happiest
of
lives
the
bills
were
not
settled
yet
indeed
they
formed
part
of
herbert
most
pressing
embarrassments
this
was
one
cause
of
the
between
them
and
there
were
others
of
a
different
nature
anthony
and
herbert
dare
had
never
been
cordial
with
each
other
even
in
childhood
anthony
called
by
herbert
advanced
who
wants
to
skulk
away
asked
he
are
you
judging
me
by
yourself
i
hope
not
returned
herbert
in
tones
of
the
most
withering
contempt
and
scorn
listen
to
me
i
told
you
five
hundred
times
that
have
some
settlement
and
if
you
do
come
to
it
amicably
i
force
you
to
it
do
you
hear
you
i
you
to
it
try
it
retorted
anthony
with
a
mocking
laugh
and
he
coolly
walked
away
walked
away
leaving
herbert
in
a
towering
rage
he
felt
inclined
to
follow
him
to
knock
him
down
had
anthony
only
met
the
affair
in
a
proper
spirit
it
had
been
different
had
he
said
herbert
i
am
uncommonly
vexed
i
see
what
can
be
done
or
words
to
that
effect
half
the
sting
in
his
brother
mind
would
have
been
removed
but
to
taunt
herbert
with
having
to
pay
as
he
sometimes
did
was
almost
unbearable
had
herbert
been
of
anthony
temper
he
would
have
proved
that
it
was
quite
unbearable
but
herbert
temper
was
roused
now
it
was
the
toss
of
a
die
whether
he
followed
anthony
and
struck
him
down
or
whether
he
did
not
the
die
was
cast
by
the
appearance
of
signora
varsini
and
anthony
for
that
evening
escaped
it
was
not
very
gallant
of
herbert
to
remain
where
he
was
in
the
presence
of
the
governess
astride
upon
the
garden
bench
herbert
was
feeling
angry
in
no
ordinary
degree
and
this
may
have
been
his
excuse
she
came
up
apparently
in
anger
also
her
brow
was
frowning
her
compressed
mouth
drawn
in
until
its
lips
were
hidden
there
is
good
advice
in
the
old
song
or
saying
it
is
well
to
be
off
with
the
old
love
before
you
are
on
with
the
new
as
good
advice
as
that
of
dare
relative
to
the
bills
herbert
might
have
sung
it
in
character
he
should
have
made
things
square
with
the
signora
varsini
before
entering
too
extensively
on
his
friendship
with
anna
lynn
not
that
the
governess
could
be
supposed
to
occupy
any
position
in
the
mind
or
heart
of
herbert
dare
except
governess
governess
to
his
sisters
herbert
would
probably
have
said
so
had
you
asked
him
what
might
have
said
is
a
different
matter
she
looks
angry
enough
to
say
anything
just
now
the
fact
appeared
to
be
so
far
as
any
one
not
personally
interested
in
the
matter
could
be
supposed
to
gather
it
that
herbert
had
latterly
given
offence
to
the
governess
by
not
going
to
the
for
what
he
called
his
italian
lessons
of
course
he
could
not
be
in
two
places
at
once
and
if
his
leisure
hour
after
dinner
was
spent
in
atterly
field
it
was
impossible
that
he
could
be
in
the
learning
italian
with
the
governess
but
she
resented
it
as
a
slight
she
was
of
an
exacting
nature
probably
of
a
jealous
nature
and
she
regarded
it
as
a
personal
slight
and
resented
it
bitterly
she
had
been
rather
abrupt
in
speech
and
manner
to
herbert
in
consequence
and
that
resented
but
being
naturally
of
an
easy
temper
herbert
was
no
friend
to
unnecessary
disputes
he
tried
what
he
could
towards
soothing
the
young
lady
and
finding
he
effected
no
good
in
that
way
he
adopted
the
other
alternative
he
shunned
her
the
governess
perceived
this
and
worked
herself
up
into
a
state
of
she
came
down
upon
him
in
full
sail
the
moment
herbert
saw
her
he
remembered
having
given
her
a
the
previous
day
to
pay
her
a
visit
that
evening
now
for
it
thought
he
to
himself
why
you
keep
me
waiting
like
this
began
she
when
she
was
close
to
him
have
i
kept
you
waiting
civilly
returned
herbert
i
am
very
sorry
the
fact
is
mademoiselle
i
have
a
good
deal
of
worry
upon
me
and
fit
for
nobody
company
but
my
own
you
might
not
have
thanked
me
for
my
visit
had
i
come
that
is
my
own
replied
the
governess
when
a
gentleman
makes
a
promise
to
me
i
expect
him
to
keep
it
i
go
up
to
the
and
i
wait
i
wait
i
wait
ah
my
poor
patience
how
i
wait
i
have
that
copy
of
tasso
that
you
said
you
would
like
to
see
will
you
come
herbert
thought
he
was
in
for
it
he
glanced
at
the
setting
sun
at
least
at
the
spot
where
the
sun
had
gone
down
for
it
had
sunk
below
the
horizon
leaving
only
crimson
streaks
in
the
grey
sky
to
tell
of
what
had
been
twilight
was
rapidly
coming
on
when
he
would
depart
to
pay
his
usual
evening
visit
there
was
no
time
he
decided
for
tasso
and
the
governess
i
come
another
evening
said
he
i
have
an
engagement
and
i
must
go
out
to
keep
it
a
stony
hardness
settled
on
mademoiselle
face
what
engagement
she
imperatively
demanded
it
might
be
thought
that
herbert
would
have
been
justified
in
civilly
declining
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
what
was
it
to
her
apparently
he
thought
otherwise
possibly
he
was
afraid
of
an
outbreak
what
engagement
oh
i
am
going
to
play
a
pool
at
billiards
with
lord
hawkesley
he
is
in
helstonleigh
again
and
that
is
what
you
go
for
every
evening
to
play
billiards
with
lord
hawkesley
she
resumed
her
eyes
glistening
ominously
of
course
it
is
mademoiselle
with
hawkesley
or
other
fellows
a
lie
curtly
responded
mademoiselle
i
say
cried
herbert
laughing
do
you
call
that
orthodox
language
it
nothing
to
you
what
i
call
it
she
cried
clipping
her
words
in
her
vehemence
as
she
would
do
when
excited
it
not
with
milord
hawkesley
not
to
billiards
that
you
go
i
know
it
is
not
then
i
tell
you
that
i
often
play
billiards
cried
herbert
on
my
honour
i
do
answered
she
very
rapidly
but
it
not
to
billiards
that
you
go
every
evening
every
evening
every
evening
not
an
evening
now
but
you
go
out
you
go
out
i
bought
tasso
do
you
know
that
i
tasso
that
i
have
bought
it
with
my
money
that
you
may
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
me
read
it
as
you
said
as
you
call
it
should
i
spend
the
money
had
i
thought
you
would
not
come
when
i
had
it
would
not
care
to
hear
it
read
had
she
been
in
a
more
amiable
mood
herbert
would
have
told
her
that
she
was
a
simpleton
for
spending
her
money
he
would
have
told
her
that
tasso
read
in
the
original
would
have
been
to
him
unintelligible
as
sanscrit
he
had
a
faint
remembrance
of
saying
to
mademoiselle
that
he
should
like
to
read
tasso
in
answer
to
a
remark
that
tasso
was
her
favourite
of
the
italian
poets
but
he
had
only
made
the
observation
carelessly
without
seriously
meaning
anything
and
she
had
been
so
foolish
as
to
go
and
buy
it
will
you
come
this
evening
and
hear
it
begun
she
continued
breaking
the
pause
and
speaking
rather
more
graciously
upon
my
word
of
honour
bianca
i
ca
he
answered
feeling
himself
between
the
two
the
engagement
made
and
the
engagement
sought
to
be
made
somewhat
embarrassed
i
will
come
another
evening
you
may
depend
upon
me
you
say
to
me
yesterday
that
you
would
come
this
evening
that
i
might
depend
upon
you
much
you
care
but
i
could
not
help
myself
an
engagement
arose
and
i
was
obliged
to
fall
in
with
it
i
was
indeed
i
hear
tasso
another
evening
you
will
not
break
your
paltry
engagement
at
billiards
to
keep
your
word
to
a
lady
bien
it
it
is
not
altogether
that
replied
herbert
getting
out
of
the
reproach
in
the
best
way
he
could
i
have
some
business
as
well
she
fastened
her
glistening
eyes
upon
him
there
was
an
expression
in
them
which
herbert
neither
understood
nor
liked
très
bien
she
slowly
repeated
i
know
where
you
are
going
and
for
what
a
smile
at
her
assumed
knowledge
and
what
it
was
worth
flitted
over
herbert
dare
face
you
are
very
wise
said
he
take
care
of
yourself
mon
ami
tout
ce
que
je
vous
dis
now
mademoiselle
what
is
the
matter
that
you
should
look
and
speak
in
that
manner
he
asked
still
in
the
same
tone
as
if
he
would
fain
pass
the
affair
away
in
a
joke
i
sure
i
have
enough
bother
upon
me
without
your
adding
to
it
what
is
your
bother
never
mind
it
would
give
you
no
pleasure
to
know
it
it
is
caused
by
anthony
and
be
hanged
to
him
anthony
is
worth
ten
of
you
fiercely
responded
mademoiselle
every
one
to
his
own
liking
carelessly
remarked
herbert
it
well
for
me
that
all
the
world
does
not
think
as
you
do
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
looked
as
though
she
would
like
to
beat
him
so
she
foamed
drawing
back
her
bloodless
lips
now
that
your
turn
is
served
bianca
varsini
may
just
be
sent
to
the
enfer
mon
camarade
garde
your
voice
replied
herbert
the
cows
yonder
will
think
it
a
tempest
i
wish
my
turn
served
in
more
ways
than
one
what
particular
turn
do
you
mean
if
it
buying
tasso
i
purchase
it
from
you
at
double
price
he
could
not
help
giving
her
a
little
chaff
it
was
what
he
would
have
called
it
chaff
exacting
people
fretted
his
generally
easy
temper
and
he
was
beginning
to
fear
that
she
would
detain
him
until
it
was
too
late
to
see
anna
but
on
the
latter
score
he
was
set
at
rest
with
a
few
words
spoken
in
italian
she
nodded
her
head
angrily
at
him
and
turned
away
fierce
words
in
spite
of
their
low
tone
herbert
was
sure
they
were
but
he
could
not
catch
one
of
them
had
he
caught
them
all
it
would
have
come
to
the
same
so
far
as
his
understanding
went
excellent
as
signora
varsini
method
of
teaching
italian
may
have
been
her
lessons
had
not
as
yet
been
very
efficient
for
herbert
dare
she
crossed
her
hands
before
her
and
went
down
the
walk
taking
the
path
to
the
house
proceeding
straight
up
to
the
she
met
cyril
on
the
stairs
he
had
apparently
been
dressing
himself
for
the
evening
and
was
going
out
to
spend
it
the
governess
caught
him
abruptly
pulled
him
inside
the
and
closed
the
door
i
say
mademoiselle
what
that
for
asked
cyril
believing
by
the
fierce
look
of
the
young
lady
that
she
was
about
to
take
some
summary
vengeance
upon
him
cyril
you
tell
me
where
is
it
that
herbert
goes
to
of
an
evening
every
evening
every
evening
cyril
stared
excessively
what
does
it
concern
you
to
know
where
he
goes
mademoiselle
returned
he
i
want
to
know
for
my
own
reasons
and
that
enough
for
you
monsieur
cyril
where
does
he
go
he
goes
out
responded
cyril
the
governess
stamped
her
foot
petulantly
i
could
tell
you
that
he
goes
out
i
ask
you
where
it
is
that
he
goes
how
should
i
know
was
cyril
answer
it
not
my
business
you
know
demanded
mademoiselle
no
that
i
do
heartily
spoke
cyril
do
you
suppose
i
watch
him
mademoiselle
he
pretty
soon
pitch
into
me
if
he
caught
me
at
that
game
i
dare
say
he
goes
to
billiards
the
suggestion
excited
the
ire
of
the
governess
he
has
been
telling
you
to
say
so
she
said
menace
in
every
tone
of
her
voice
every
gesture
of
her
lifted
hand
cyril
opened
his
eyes
to
their
utmost
width
he
could
not
understand
why
the
governess
should
be
asking
him
this
or
why
herbert
movements
should
concern
her
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
it
he
answered
and
so
far
he
spoke
the
truth
i
do
know
that
herbert
goes
anywhere
in
particular
of
an
evening
if
he
does
he
would
not
tell
me
she
laid
her
hand
heavily
on
his
shoulder
she
brought
her
face
terrible
in
its
livid
earnestness
almost
into
contact
with
his
ecoutez
mon
ami
she
whispered
to
the
amazed
cyril
if
you
are
going
to
play
this
game
with
me
i
will
play
one
with
you
who
wore
the
cloak
to
that
boucherie
and
got
the
money
who
ripped
out
the
écossais
side
afterwards
leaving
it
all
mangled
and
open
think
you
i
do
know
ah
ha
monsieur
cyril
you
can
not
play
the
farce
with
me
cyril
face
turned
ghastly
drops
of
sweat
broke
out
over
his
forehead
hush
he
cried
looking
round
in
the
instinct
of
terror
lest
listeners
should
be
at
hand
yes
you
say
she
resumed
i
will
hush
if
you
do
make
me
speak
i
have
hushed
ever
since
you
tell
me
what
i
want
to
know
and
i
hush
always
mademoiselle
varsini
he
cried
his
manner
too
painfully
earnest
for
her
to
doubt
now
that
he
spoke
the
truth
i
declare
that
i
know
nothing
of
herbert
movements
i
do
know
where
he
goes
or
what
he
does
when
i
told
you
i
supposed
he
went
to
billiards
i
said
what
i
thought
might
be
the
case
he
may
go
to
fifty
places
of
an
evening
for
all
i
can
tell
tell
me
what
it
is
you
want
found
out
and
i
will
try
and
do
it
cyril
was
not
one
to
play
the
spy
on
his
brother
in
fact
as
he
had
just
classically
observed
to
the
young
lady
herbert
would
have
pitched
into
him
had
he
found
him
attempting
it
and
serve
him
right
but
cyril
saw
that
he
was
in
her
power
and
that
made
all
the
difference
he
would
now
have
tracked
herbert
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
at
her
bidding
but
she
did
not
bid
him
quite
the
contrary
she
took
her
hand
from
cyril
shoulder
opened
the
door
and
said
she
did
not
want
him
any
longer
it
is
no
matter
cried
she
i
wanted
to
learn
something
about
monsieur
herbert
for
a
reason
but
if
you
do
not
know
it
let
it
pass
it
is
no
matter
cyril
departed
first
of
all
lifting
his
cowardly
face
it
looked
a
coward
then
you
keep
counsel
mademoiselle
yes
when
people
do
offend
me
i
do
offend
them
she
stood
at
the
door
after
he
had
gone
down
half
in
half
out
of
the
room
apparently
in
deep
thought
presently
footsteps
were
heard
coming
up
and
she
retreated
and
closed
the
door
they
were
those
of
herbert
he
went
on
to
his
room
remained
there
a
few
minutes
and
then
came
out
again
mademoiselle
had
the
door
ajar
as
he
descended
her
quick
eye
detected
that
he
had
been
giving
a
few
finishing
touches
to
his
toilette
brushing
his
hair
pulling
down
his
wristbands
and
various
other
little
odds
and
ends
of
dandyism
and
you
do
that
to
play
billiards
nodded
she
inwardly
as
she
looked
after
him
i
see
monsieur
upstairs
with
a
soft
step
went
she
to
her
own
chamber
she
reached
from
her
box
a
long
and
loose
cloak
similar
to
those
worn
by
the
women
of
france
and
flanders
and
a
black
silk
quilted
bonnet
it
was
her
travelling
attire
and
she
put
it
on
now
then
she
locked
her
chamber
door
behind
her
and
slipped
down
into
the
with
as
soft
a
step
as
she
had
gone
up
passing
out
at
the
open
window
she
kept
tolerably
under
cover
of
the
trees
and
gained
the
road
it
was
quite
dusk
then
but
she
recognized
herbert
before
her
walking
with
a
quick
step
she
put
on
a
quick
step
also
keeping
a
safe
distance
between
herself
and
him
he
went
through
the
town
to
the
london
road
and
turned
into
atterly
field
the
governess
turned
into
it
after
him
there
she
stopped
under
the
hedge
to
reconnoitre
a
few
minutes
and
she
could
distinguish
that
he
was
joined
by
some
young
girl
whom
he
met
with
every
token
of
respect
and
confidence
a
strange
cry
went
forth
on
the
evening
air
herbert
dare
was
startled
what
noise
was
that
he
exclaimed
anna
had
heard
nothing
it
must
have
been
one
of
the
lambs
in
the
field
herbert
it
was
more
like
a
human
voice
in
pain
observed
herbert
but
they
heard
no
more
they
began
their
usual
walk
a
few
paces
backward
and
forward
beneath
the
most
sheltered
part
of
the
hedge
anna
taking
his
arm
mademoiselle
could
see
as
well
as
the
darkness
allowed
her
but
she
could
not
hear
her
face
peeping
out
of
the
shadowy
bonnet
was
not
unlike
the
face
of
a
tiger
she
crawled
away
she
had
noticed
as
she
turned
into
the
field
an
iron
gate
that
led
into
the
garden
which
the
hedge
skirted
she
crept
round
to
it
found
it
locked
and
mounted
it
it
had
spikes
on
the
top
but
the
signora
would
not
have
cared
just
then
had
she
found
herself
impaled
she
got
safe
over
it
and
then
considered
how
to
reach
the
spot
where
they
stood
without
their
hearing
her
would
she
be
baffled
be
baffled
no
she
stooped
down
unlaced
her
boots
and
stole
softly
on
in
her
stockings
and
there
she
was
almost
as
close
to
them
as
they
were
to
each
other
where
had
the
signora
heard
those
gentle
timid
tones
before
a
lovely
girl
looking
little
more
than
a
child
in
her
modest
quaker
dress
rose
to
her
mind
eye
she
had
seen
her
with
miss
ashley
she
the
signora
knelt
down
upon
the
earth
the
better
to
catch
what
was
said
listeners
never
hear
any
good
of
themselves
it
is
a
proverb
too
often
exemplified
as
the
signora
could
have
told
that
night
herbert
dare
was
accounting
for
his
late
appearance
which
he
laid
to
the
charge
of
the
governess
he
gave
a
description
of
the
interview
she
had
volunteered
him
in
the
garden
at
home
more
ludicrous
perhaps
than
true
but
certainly
not
complimentary
to
the
signora
anna
laughed
and
the
lady
on
the
other
side
gathered
that
this
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
formed
a
topic
of
merriment
between
them
you
should
have
seen
her
face
as
she
herself
might
have
said
she
stayed
out
the
interview
when
it
was
over
and
herbert
dare
had
departed
she
put
on
her
boots
and
mounted
the
gate
again
but
she
was
not
so
agile
this
time
and
a
spike
entered
her
wrist
binding
her
handkerchief
round
it
to
arrest
the
blood
she
returned
to
pomeranian
knoll
five
hundred
questions
were
showered
upon
her
when
she
entered
the
looking
calm
and
impassible
as
ever
not
a
tress
of
her
elaborate
braids
of
hair
was
out
of
place
not
a
fold
awry
in
her
dress
much
wonder
had
been
excited
by
her
failing
to
appear
at
tea
minny
had
drummed
a
waltz
on
her
chamber
door
but
mademoiselle
would
not
open
it
and
would
not
speak
i
can
not
speak
when
i
am
lying
down
with
those
headaches
remarked
mademoiselle
have
you
a
headache
mademoiselle
asked
dare
will
you
have
a
cup
of
tea
brought
up
mademoiselle
declined
the
tea
she
was
not
thirsty
what
have
you
done
to
your
wrist
mademoiselle
called
out
herbert
who
was
stretched
on
a
sofa
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
my
wrist
oh
i
scratched
it
how
did
you
manage
that
ah
bah
it
nothing
responded
mademoiselle
chapter
xxvii
the
quarrel
it
is
grievous
when
arises
between
brothers
that
that
should
be
cherished
instead
of
being
subdued
but
such
was
the
case
with
anthony
and
herbert
dare
by
the
time
the
sunny
month
of
may
came
in
matters
had
grown
to
such
a
height
between
them
that
dare
found
himself
compelled
to
interfere
it
was
beginning
to
make
things
in
the
house
uncomfortable
they
would
meet
at
meals
and
not
only
abstain
from
speaking
to
each
other
but
take
every
possible
opportunity
of
showing
mutual
and
marked
discourtesy
no
positive
outbreak
between
them
had
as
yet
taken
place
in
the
presence
of
the
family
but
it
was
only
smouldering
and
might
be
daily
looked
for
dare
so
far
as
the
original
cause
went
blamed
his
eldest
son
undoubtedly
anthony
had
been
solely
in
fault
it
was
a
dishonourable
ungenerous
unmanly
act
to
draw
his
brother
into
trouble
and
to
do
it
plausibly
and
deceitfully
at
the
stage
of
the
affair
dare
saw
occasion
to
blame
herbert
more
than
anthony
it
is
you
who
keep
up
the
ball
herbert
he
said
to
him
if
you
would
suffer
the
matter
to
die
away
anthony
would
do
so
of
course
he
would
herbert
replied
he
has
served
his
turn
and
would
be
glad
that
it
should
end
there
it
was
in
vain
that
dare
talked
to
them
a
dozen
times
did
he
recommend
them
to
shake
hands
and
make
it
up
neither
appeared
inclined
to
take
the
advice
anthony
was
sullen
he
would
have
been
content
to
let
the
affair
drop
quietly
into
oblivion
perhaps
as
herbert
said
had
been
glad
that
it
should
so
drop
but
make
the
slightest
move
towards
it
he
would
not
herbert
openly
said
that
not
shake
hands
if
anthony
wanted
ever
to
shake
hands
with
him
again
let
him
pay
up
lay
the
grievance
paying
up
the
bills
not
paid
were
a
terrible
thorn
in
the
side
of
herbert
dare
he
was
responsible
and
he
knew
not
one
hour
from
another
but
he
might
be
arrested
on
them
to
soothe
matters
between
his
sons
dare
would
willingly
have
taken
the
charge
of
payment
upon
himself
but
he
had
positively
not
the
money
to
do
it
with
in
point
of
fact
dare
was
growing
seriously
embarrassed
on
his
own
score
he
had
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
with
his
sons
with
anthony
in
particular
and
he
had
grown
sick
and
tired
of
helping
them
out
of
pecuniary
difficulties
still
he
would
have
relieved
herbert
of
this
one
nightmare
had
it
been
in
his
power
herbert
had
been
deluded
into
it
without
any
advantage
to
himself
therefore
dare
had
the
will
could
he
have
managed
it
to
help
him
out
he
told
herbert
that
he
would
see
what
he
could
do
after
a
while
the
promise
did
not
relieve
herbert
of
present
fears
neither
did
it
restore
peace
between
the
malcontents
had
herbert
been
relieved
of
that
particular
embarrassment
others
would
have
remained
to
him
but
that
fact
did
not
in
the
least
lessen
his
soreness
as
to
the
point
in
question
it
was
an
intensely
hot
day
far
hotter
than
is
usual
at
the
season
and
the
afternoon
sun
streamed
full
on
the
windows
of
pomeranian
knoll
suggesting
thoughts
of
july
instead
of
may
a
gay
party
at
any
rate
a
party
dressed
in
gay
attire
were
crossing
the
hall
to
enter
a
carriage
that
waited
at
the
door
dare
dare
and
adelaide
dare
had
always
been
given
to
gay
attire
and
her
daughters
had
inherited
her
taste
they
were
going
to
dine
at
a
friend
house
a
few
distance
from
helstonleigh
the
invitation
was
for
seven
it
was
now
striking
six
the
at
dare
minny
looking
half
melted
had
perched
herself
upon
the
end
of
the
balustrades
to
watch
the
departure
you
fall
child
said
dare
minny
laughed
and
said
there
was
no
danger
of
her
falling
she
wondered
what
her
father
would
think
if
he
saw
her
sometimes
at
her
gymnastics
on
the
balustrades
taking
a
sweeping
slide
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
she
generally
contrived
that
he
should
not
see
her
or
mademoiselle
either
mademoiselle
had
caught
sight
of
the
performance
once
and
had
given
her
a
whole
french
fable
to
learn
by
way
of
punishment
are
we
to
have
strawberries
for
dinner
mamma
asked
minny
you
will
have
what
i
have
thought
proper
to
order
replied
dare
rather
sharply
she
was
feeling
hot
and
cross
something
had
put
her
out
while
dressing
i
think
you
might
wait
for
strawberries
until
they
are
ripe
in
our
own
garden
not
buy
them
regardless
of
cost
interposed
dare
speaking
for
the
general
benefit
but
not
to
any
one
in
particular
minny
dropped
the
subject
your
dress
is
turned
up
adelaide
said
she
adelaide
looked
languidly
behind
her
and
a
maid
who
had
followed
them
down
advanced
and
put
right
the
refractory
dress
a
handsome
dress
of
pink
silk
glistening
with
its
own
richness
at
that
moment
anthony
entered
the
hall
he
had
just
come
home
to
dinner
and
looked
in
a
very
bad
humour
how
late
you
be
he
cried
not
at
all
we
shall
drive
there
in
an
hour
they
swept
out
at
the
door
dare
and
adelaide
dare
was
about
to
follow
them
when
a
sudden
thought
appeared
to
strike
him
and
he
turned
back
and
addressed
anthony
you
young
men
take
care
that
you
do
get
quarrelling
with
each
other
do
you
hear
anthony
i
hear
ungraciously
replied
anthony
not
turning
to
speak
but
continuing
his
way
up
to
his
he
probably
regarded
the
injunction
with
contempt
for
it
was
too
much
in
anthony
dare
nature
so
to
regard
all
advice
of
whatever
kind
nevertheless
it
had
been
well
that
he
had
given
heed
to
it
it
had
been
well
that
that
last
word
to
his
father
had
been
one
of
affection
dinner
was
served
anthony
in
the
absence
of
and
dare
took
the
head
rosa
with
a
show
of
great
parade
and
ceremony
assumed
the
seat
opposite
to
him
and
said
she
should
be
mistress
minny
responded
that
rosa
was
not
going
to
be
mistress
over
her
and
the
governess
desired
miss
rosa
not
to
talk
so
loudly
rather
derogatory
checks
these
to
the
dignity
of
a
mistress
herbert
was
not
at
table
irregular
as
the
young
dares
were
in
many
of
their
habits
they
were
generally
home
to
dinner
minny
wondered
aloud
where
herbert
was
anthony
replied
that
he
was
skulking
skulking
echoed
minny
yes
skulking
angrily
repeated
anthony
he
left
the
office
at
three
and
has
never
been
near
it
since
and
the
governor
left
at
four
he
added
in
a
tone
that
seemed
to
say
he
considered
that
also
a
grievance
where
did
herbert
go
to
asked
rosa
i
do
know
responded
anthony
i
only
know
that
i
had
a
double
share
of
work
to
do
anthony
dare
was
no
friend
to
work
and
having
had
to
do
a
little
more
than
he
would
have
done
had
herbert
remained
at
his
post
had
considerably
aggravated
his
temper
why
should
monsieur
herbert
go
away
and
leave
you
his
work
to
do
inquired
the
governess
lifting
her
eyes
from
her
plate
to
anthony
i
shall
take
care
to
ask
him
why
returned
anthony
it
is
not
fair
that
he
should
continued
mademoiselle
i
would
not
have
done
it
for
him
monsieur
anthony
neither
should
i
had
i
not
been
obliged
said
anthony
not
in
the
least
relaxing
from
his
either
in
looks
or
tone
it
was
work
that
had
to
be
done
before
and
one
of
our
clerks
is
away
on
business
dinner
proceeded
to
its
close
joseph
hesitated
unwilling
to
remove
the
cloth
is
it
to
be
left
for
mr
herbert
he
asked
no
imperiously
answered
anthony
if
he
can
not
come
in
for
dinner
dinner
shall
not
be
kept
for
him
cook
is
keeping
the
things
by
the
fire
sir
then
tell
her
to
save
herself
the
trouble
so
the
cloth
was
removed
and
dessert
put
on
to
minny
inexpressible
disappointment
it
turned
out
that
there
were
no
strawberries
this
put
into
an
and
she
left
the
table
and
the
room
declaring
she
would
not
touch
anything
else
mademoiselle
varsini
called
her
back
and
ordered
her
to
her
seat
she
would
not
permit
so
great
a
breach
of
discipline
cyril
and
george
who
were
not
under
mademoiselle
control
gulped
down
a
glass
of
wine
and
hastened
out
to
keep
an
engagement
it
was
a
very
innocent
one
a
cricket
match
had
been
organized
for
the
evening
by
some
of
the
old
college
boys
and
cyril
and
george
were
amongst
the
players
it
has
never
been
mentioned
that
ashley
in
his
strict
sense
of
justice
had
allowed
cyril
the
privilege
of
spending
his
evenings
at
home
five
nights
in
the
week
as
he
did
to
william
halliburton
the
rest
remained
at
table
minny
per
force
rosa
to
take
an
unlimited
quantity
of
oranges
mademoiselle
varsini
because
it
was
the
custom
to
remain
but
mademoiselle
soon
rose
and
withdrew
with
her
pupils
anthony
was
not
showing
himself
a
particularly
sociable
companion
he
had
not
touched
any
dessert
but
seemed
to
be
drinking
a
good
deal
of
wine
as
they
were
going
out
of
the
room
herbert
bustled
in
now
then
take
care
cried
he
for
minny
paying
little
attention
to
her
movements
had
gone
full
tilt
at
him
oh
herbert
ca
you
see
cried
she
dolefully
rubbing
her
head
what
made
you
so
late
dinner
gone
away
it
can
be
brought
in
again
replied
herbert
carelessly
comme
il
est
chaud
pas
mademoiselle
this
last
was
addressed
to
the
governess
rosa
screamed
with
laughter
at
his
bad
french
and
mademoiselle
smiled
you
get
on
in
french
as
you
do
in
italian
monsieur
herbert
cried
she
and
that
is
what
you
call
backward
herbert
laughed
he
did
not
know
what
particular
mistake
he
had
made
truth
to
say
he
did
not
care
they
withdrew
and
he
rang
the
bell
for
his
dinner
mind
herbert
cried
minny
putting
in
her
head
again
at
the
door
papa
said
you
were
not
to
quarrel
better
perhaps
that
she
had
not
said
it
who
can
tell
the
brothers
remained
alone
anthony
sullen
and
as
yet
silent
he
appeared
to
have
emptied
the
port
wine
decanter
and
to
be
beginning
upon
the
sherry
herbert
strolled
past
him
supreme
indifference
in
his
manner
some
might
have
said
contempt
and
stood
just
outside
the
window
whistling
you
have
not
forgotten
that
this
window
opened
to
the
ground
the
apartment
was
long
and
somewhat
narrow
the
window
large
and
high
and
opening
in
the
centre
after
the
manner
of
a
french
one
the
door
was
at
one
end
of
the
room
the
window
at
the
other
anthony
was
in
too
quarrelsome
a
mood
to
remain
silent
long
he
began
the
skirmish
by
demanding
what
herbert
meant
by
absenting
himself
from
the
office
for
the
afternoon
and
where
he
had
been
to
his
resentful
tones
his
authoritative
words
were
not
calculated
to
win
a
very
civil
answer
they
did
not
win
one
from
herbert
tones
were
resentful
too
his
words
were
coolly
aggravating
anthony
was
not
his
master
when
he
was
he
might
perhaps
answer
him
such
was
their
purport
a
hot
interchange
of
words
ensued
nothing
more
anthony
remained
at
the
table
herbert
half
in
half
out
of
the
window
leaned
against
its
frame
when
joseph
returned
to
put
things
in
readiness
for
dinner
they
had
subsided
into
quietness
it
was
only
a
lull
in
the
storm
joseph
placed
the
dessert
nearer
anthony
end
of
the
table
and
laid
the
cloth
across
the
other
end
herbert
came
into
the
room
what
a
time
you
are
with
dinner
joseph
cried
he
one
would
think
it
was
being
cooked
over
again
cook
warming
it
sir
warming
it
echoed
herbert
why
could
she
keep
it
warm
she
might
be
sure
i
should
be
home
to
dinner
she
was
keeping
it
warm
sir
but
anthony
ordered
it
to
be
put
away
now
the
man
had
really
no
intention
of
making
mischief
when
he
said
this
that
it
might
cause
between
the
brothers
never
crossed
his
mind
he
was
only
anxious
that
he
and
the
cook
should
stand
free
from
blame
for
the
young
dares
when
displeased
with
the
servants
were
not
in
the
habit
of
sparing
them
herbert
turned
to
anthony
what
business
have
you
to
interfere
with
my
dinner
or
with
anything
else
that
concerns
me
i
choose
to
make
it
my
business
insolently
retorted
anthony
at
this
juncture
joseph
left
the
room
he
had
laid
the
cloth
and
had
nothing
more
to
stay
for
better
perhaps
that
he
had
remained
surely
they
would
not
have
proceeded
to
extremities
the
brothers
before
their
servant
in
a
short
time
sounds
as
if
both
were
in
a
terrible
state
of
fury
resounded
through
the
house
from
the
the
sounds
did
not
reach
the
kitchen
which
was
partially
detached
from
the
house
but
the
young
ladies
heard
them
and
came
running
out
of
the
the
governess
was
in
the
the
noise
penetrated
even
there
she
also
came
forth
and
saw
her
two
pupils
extended
over
the
balustrades
listening
at
any
other
time
mademoiselle
would
have
reproved
them
now
she
crept
down
and
leaned
over
in
company
what
can
be
the
matter
whispered
she
papa
told
them
not
to
quarrel
was
all
the
answer
uttered
by
minny
it
was
a
terrible
quarrel
there
was
little
doubt
of
that
no
play
passionate
bursts
of
fury
rose
incessantly
now
from
one
now
from
the
other
now
from
both
hot
recrimination
words
that
were
not
suited
to
unaccustomed
ears
or
to
any
ears
for
the
matter
of
that
rose
high
and
loud
the
governess
turned
pale
and
minny
burst
into
tears
some
one
ought
to
go
into
the
room
said
rosa
minny
you
go
tell
them
to
be
quiet
i
am
afraid
replied
minny
so
am
i
a
fearful
sound
an
explosion
louder
than
all
the
rest
a
noise
as
if
some
heavy
weight
had
been
thrown
down
had
it
come
to
blows
minny
shrieked
and
at
the
same
moment
joseph
was
seen
coming
along
with
a
tray
herbert
dinner
upon
it
his
presence
seemed
to
bring
with
it
a
sense
of
courage
and
rosa
and
minny
flew
down
followed
by
the
governess
herbert
had
been
knocked
down
by
anthony
he
was
gathering
himself
up
when
joseph
opened
the
door
gathering
himself
up
in
a
tempest
of
passion
his
white
face
a
livid
fury
as
he
caught
hold
of
a
knife
from
the
table
and
rushed
upon
anthony
but
joseph
was
too
quick
for
him
the
man
dashed
his
tray
on
the
table
seized
herbert
and
turned
the
uplifted
knife
downwards
for
sake
sir
recollect
yourself
said
he
recollect
himself
then
no
persons
who
put
themselves
into
that
mad
state
of
passion
can
not
recollect
themselves
joseph
kept
his
hold
and
the
resounded
with
shrieks
and
sobs
they
proceeded
from
rosa
and
minny
they
pulled
their
brothers
by
the
coats
they
implored
they
entreated
the
women
servants
came
flying
from
the
kitchen
and
the
italian
governess
asked
the
two
gentlemen
in
french
whether
they
were
not
ashamed
of
themselves
perhaps
they
were
at
any
rate
the
quarrel
was
for
the
time
ended
herbert
flung
the
knife
upon
the
table
and
turned
his
white
face
upon
his
brother
take
care
of
yourself
though
cried
he
in
marked
tones
i
swear
you
shall
have
it
yet
they
pulled
anthony
out
of
the
room
rosa
and
minny
or
it
is
difficult
to
say
what
rejoinder
he
might
have
made
or
how
violently
the
quarrel
might
have
been
renewed
it
was
certain
that
he
had
taken
more
wine
than
was
good
for
him
and
that
generally
speaking
did
not
improve
the
temper
of
anthony
dare
mademoiselle
varsini
walked
by
his
side
talking
volubly
in
french
whether
she
was
sympathizing
or
scolding
anthony
did
not
know
not
particularly
bright
at
understanding
french
at
the
best
of
times
even
when
spoken
slowly
he
could
not
in
his
present
excitement
catch
the
meaning
of
a
single
word
entering
the
he
threw
himself
upon
the
sofa
intending
to
smooth
down
his
ruffled
plumage
by
taking
a
nap
herbert
meanwhile
had
remained
in
the
smoothing
down
ruffled
plumage
joseph
and
the
cook
were
bending
over
the
on
the
carpet
when
joseph
dashed
down
his
tray
on
the
table
a
dish
of
potatoes
had
bounded
off
both
dish
and
potatoes
thereby
coming
to
grief
herbert
sat
down
and
made
an
excellent
dinner
he
was
not
of
a
sullen
temper
and
unlike
anthony
the
affair
once
over
he
was
soon
himself
again
should
they
come
into
contact
again
directly
there
was
no
saying
how
it
would
end
or
what
might
ensue
his
dinner
over
he
went
to
the
joseph
had
just
entered
and
was
arousing
anthony
from
the
sleep
he
had
dropped
into
one
of
the
waiters
from
the
has
come
sir
he
says
lord
hawkesley
has
sent
him
to
say
that
the
gentlemen
are
waiting
for
you
i
ca
go
tell
him
responded
anthony
speaking
as
he
looked
thoroughly
out
of
sorts
i
am
not
going
out
here
joseph
for
the
man
was
turning
away
with
the
message
sir
take
these
and
bring
me
my
slippers
these
were
his
boots
which
he
not
very
politely
kicked
off
in
the
ladies
presence
and
sent
flying
after
joseph
the
man
stooped
to
pick
them
up
and
was
carrying
them
away
here
what
a
hurry
you
are
in
began
anthony
again
take
lights
up
to
my
chamber
and
the
brandy
and
some
cold
water
i
shall
make
myself
comfortable
there
for
the
night
this
room
unbearable
with
its
present
company
the
last
was
a
shaft
levelled
at
herbert
he
did
not
retort
for
a
wonder
in
fact
anthony
afforded
little
time
for
it
before
the
words
had
well
left
his
lips
he
had
left
the
room
herbert
began
to
whistle
its
very
tone
insolent
it
appeared
almost
certain
that
the
unpleasantness
was
not
yet
over
and
rosa
audibly
wished
her
papa
was
at
home
joseph
carried
to
room
what
he
required
and
then
brought
the
tea
to
the
herbert
said
he
should
take
tea
with
them
it
was
rather
unusual
for
him
to
do
so
it
was
very
unusual
for
anthony
not
to
go
out
their
sisters
felt
sure
that
they
were
only
staying
in
to
renew
hostilities
and
again
rosa
almost
passionately
wished
for
the
presence
of
her
father
it
was
dusk
by
the
time
tea
was
over
herbert
rose
to
leave
the
room
where
are
you
going
cried
mademoiselle
sharply
after
him
that
my
business
he
replied
not
in
too
conciliatory
a
tone
perhaps
he
thought
the
question
proceeded
from
one
of
his
sisters
for
he
was
outside
the
door
when
it
reached
him
he
is
going
into
anthony
room
cried
rosa
turning
pale
as
they
heard
him
run
upstairs
oh
mademoiselle
what
can
be
done
i
think
i
call
joseph
hush
cried
mademoiselle
wait
you
here
i
will
go
and
see
she
stole
out
of
the
room
and
up
the
stairs
intending
to
reconnoitre
but
she
had
no
time
to
do
so
herbert
was
coming
down
again
and
she
could
only
slip
inside
the
door
and
peep
out
he
had
evidently
been
upstairs
for
his
cloak
for
he
was
putting
it
on
as
he
descended
the
cloak
on
a
hot
night
like
this
said
mademoiselle
mentally
he
must
want
to
disguise
himself
she
stopped
to
listen
joseph
had
come
up
the
stairs
bringing
something
to
anthony
and
herbert
arrested
him
speaking
in
low
tones
do
make
any
mistake
about
the
window
joseph
i
ca
think
how
you
could
have
been
so
stupid
last
night
sir
i
assure
you
i
left
it
undone
as
usual
replied
joseph
it
must
have
been
master
who
fastened
it
well
take
care
that
it
does
not
occur
again
said
herbert
i
expect
to
be
in
between
ten
and
eleven
but
i
may
be
later
and
i
do
want
to
ring
you
up
again
herbert
went
swiftly
downstairs
and
out
choosing
to
depart
by
the
way
as
it
appeared
that
he
intended
to
enter
the
window
joseph
proceeded
to
anthony
chamber
and
the
governess
returned
to
her
frightened
pupils
in
the
a
la
bonne
heure
she
said
to
them
monsieur
herbert
has
gone
out
and
i
heard
him
say
to
joseph
that
he
had
gone
for
the
evening
then
it
all
safe
cried
minny
and
she
began
dancing
round
the
room
mademoiselle
how
pale
you
look
mademoiselle
had
sat
down
in
her
place
before
the
and
was
leaning
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
she
was
certainly
looking
unusually
pale
enough
to
make
me
she
said
in
answer
to
minny
if
there
were
to
be
this
disturbance
often
in
the
house
i
would
not
stop
in
it
for
double
my
it
has
given
me
one
of
those
headaches
and
i
think
i
shall
go
to
bed
you
will
not
be
afraid
to
stay
up
alone
mesdemoiselles
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
now
promptly
answered
rosa
who
had
far
rather
be
without
her
governess
company
than
with
it
do
sit
up
for
us
mademoiselle
then
i
will
go
at
once
said
mademoiselle
and
she
wished
them
good
night
and
retired
to
her
chamber
part
the
third
chapter
anna
lynn
dilemma
it
was
a
lovely
evening
one
of
those
warm
still
evenings
that
may
sometimes
brings
us
when
gnats
hum
in
the
air
and
the
trees
are
at
rest
the
day
had
been
intensely
hot
the
evening
was
little
less
so
and
anna
lynn
leaned
over
the
gate
of
their
garden
striving
to
catch
what
of
freshness
there
might
be
in
the
coming
night
the
garish
day
was
fading
into
moonlight
the
distant
malvern
hills
grew
fainter
and
fainter
on
the
view
the
little
lambs
in
the
field
growing
into
great
lambs
now
some
of
them
had
long
lain
down
to
rest
and
the
thursday
evening
bells
came
chiming
pleasantly
on
the
ear
from
helstonleigh
how
late
he
is
murmured
anna
if
he
does
not
come
soon
i
shall
not
be
able
to
stay
out
even
as
the
words
passed
her
lips
a
faint
movement
might
be
distinguished
in
the
obscurity
of
the
night
telling
of
the
advent
of
herbert
dare
anna
looked
round
to
see
that
the
windows
were
clear
from
prying
eyes
and
went
forth
to
meet
him
he
had
halted
at
the
usual
place
under
cover
of
the
hedge
the
hedge
of
sweetbriar
skirting
that
side
garden
into
which
signora
varsini
had
made
good
her
in
the
gratification
of
her
curiosity
a
shaded
walk
and
a
quiet
one
very
little
fear
there
of
overlookers
herbert
thee
art
late
cried
anna
a
good
thing
i
was
able
to
come
at
all
responded
herbert
taking
anna
arm
within
his
own
i
thought
at
one
time
i
must
have
remained
at
home
to
chastise
my
brother
anthony
chastise
thy
brother
anthony
repeated
anna
in
astonishment
herbert
for
the
first
time
told
her
of
the
unpleasantness
that
existed
between
his
brother
and
himself
he
did
not
mention
the
precise
cause
but
simply
said
anthony
had
behaved
ill
to
him
and
drawn
down
upon
him
trouble
and
vexation
anna
was
all
sympathy
had
herbert
told
her
the
offence
had
lain
on
his
side
not
on
anthony
her
entire
sympathy
had
still
been
his
she
deemed
herbert
everything
that
was
good
and
great
and
worthy
anthony
what
little
she
knew
of
him
she
did
not
like
herbert
maybe
he
will
be
striking
thee
in
secret
when
thee
art
unprepared
let
him
carelessly
replied
herbert
i
can
strike
again
i
am
stronger
than
he
is
i
know
one
thing
either
he
or
i
must
leave
my
father
house
and
take
lodgings
we
ca
remain
in
it
together
it
would
be
he
to
leave
would
it
not
herbert
thy
father
would
not
be
so
unjust
as
to
turn
thee
out
for
thy
brother
fault
i
do
know
about
that
said
herbert
i
expect
it
is
i
who
would
have
to
go
anthony
is
the
eldest
and
my
mother
favourite
anna
lifted
her
hand
in
her
innocent
surprise
anthony
the
favourite
by
the
side
of
herbert
she
could
not
understand
how
so
great
an
anomaly
could
exist
interested
in
the
topic
the
time
slipped
on
during
a
moment
of
silence
when
they
had
halted
in
their
walk
they
heard
what
was
called
the
ten
bell
strike
out
from
helstonleigh
a
bell
that
boomed
out
over
the
city
every
night
for
ten
minutes
before
ten
the
sound
startled
anna
she
had
indeed
overstayed
her
time
one
moment
anna
cried
herbert
as
she
was
preparing
to
fly
off
there
ca
be
any
such
hurry
hester
will
not
be
going
to
bed
yet
on
a
hot
night
like
this
i
wanted
you
to
return
me
that
book
if
you
have
done
with
it
it
is
not
mine
and
i
have
been
asked
for
it
truth
to
say
anna
would
be
glad
to
return
it
the
book
was
lalla
rookh
and
anna
had
been
upon
thorns
all
the
time
she
had
been
reading
it
lest
by
some
unlucky
mishap
it
might
reach
the
eyes
of
patience
thought
it
everything
that
was
beautiful
she
had
read
pages
of
it
over
and
over
again
they
wore
for
her
a
strange
enchantment
but
she
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
neither
book
nor
reading
would
be
approved
by
patience
i
bring
it
out
to
thee
at
once
herbert
if
i
can
she
hastily
said
if
not
i
will
give
it
thee
evening
not
so
fast
young
lady
said
herbert
laughing
and
detaining
her
you
may
not
come
back
again
i
wish
you
good
night
now
nay
please
thee
let
me
go
what
will
hester
say
to
me
scarcely
giving
a
moment
to
the
adieu
anna
sped
with
swift
feet
to
the
garden
gate
but
the
moment
she
was
within
the
barrier
and
had
turned
the
key
she
began
little
dissembler
that
she
was
to
step
on
slowly
in
a
careless
manner
looking
up
at
the
sky
turning
her
head
to
the
trees
in
no
more
hurry
apparently
than
if
bedtime
were
three
hours
off
she
had
seen
hester
dell
standing
at
the
house
door
child
said
hester
gravely
thee
shouldst
not
stay
out
so
late
as
this
it
is
so
warm
a
night
hester
but
thee
shouldst
not
be
beyond
the
premises
patience
would
not
like
it
it
is
past
thy
bedtime
too
patience
has
not
come
she
added
turning
to
another
subject
her
not
come
repeated
anna
in
surprise
it
has
not
i
have
been
expecting
the
boy
to
knock
every
minute
or
i
should
have
come
to
see
after
thee
friend
parry
may
have
forgotten
it
why
of
course
he
must
have
forgotten
it
said
anna
inwardly
promising
the
boy
a
sixpence
for
his
forgetfulness
the
medicine
always
comes
in
the
morning
will
patience
sleep
without
it
i
fear
me
not
what
dost
thee
think
suppose
i
were
to
run
for
it
yes
do
hester
they
went
in
hester
closing
the
back
door
and
locking
it
she
put
on
her
shawl
and
bonnet
and
was
going
out
at
the
front
door
when
the
clock
struck
ten
it
is
ten
child
she
said
to
anna
thee
go
to
bed
thee
needst
not
sit
up
i
take
the
with
me
and
let
myself
in
oh
hester
i
do
want
to
go
to
bed
yet
returned
anna
fretfully
it
is
like
a
summer
evening
but
thee
hadst
better
child
urged
hester
patience
has
been
angry
with
me
once
or
twice
saying
i
suffer
thee
to
sit
up
late
a
pretty
budget
she
will
be
telling
thy
father
on
his
return
thee
go
to
bed
thy
candle
is
ready
here
on
the
slab
good
night
hester
departed
shutting
fast
the
door
and
carrying
with
her
the
anna
fully
convinced
that
friend
parry
forgetfulness
or
the
boy
must
have
been
designed
as
a
special
favour
to
herself
went
softly
into
the
best
parlour
to
take
the
book
out
of
her
pretty
but
the
room
was
dark
and
anna
could
not
find
her
keys
she
believed
she
had
left
her
keys
on
the
top
of
this
very
but
feel
as
she
would
she
could
not
place
her
hands
upon
them
with
a
word
of
impatience
lest
with
all
her
hurry
herbert
dare
should
be
gone
before
she
could
return
to
him
with
the
book
she
went
to
the
kitchen
lighted
the
chamber
candle
spoken
of
by
hester
as
placed
ready
for
her
use
and
carried
it
into
the
parlour
her
keys
were
found
on
the
she
unlocked
the
drawer
took
from
it
the
book
blew
out
the
candle
and
ran
through
the
garden
to
the
field
another
minute
and
herbert
would
have
left
he
was
turning
away
in
truth
he
had
not
in
the
least
expected
to
see
anna
back
again
then
you
have
been
able
to
come
he
exclaimed
in
his
surprise
hester
is
gone
out
explained
anna
friend
parry
has
forgotten
to
send
patience
medicine
and
hester
has
gone
for
it
herbert
thee
only
think
but
for
hester
expecting
parry
boy
to
knock
at
the
door
she
would
have
come
out
here
searching
for
me
she
said
she
would
i
must
never
forget
the
time
again
there
the
book
and
thank
thee
i
am
sorry
and
yet
glad
to
give
it
thee
back
is
that
not
a
paradox
asked
herbert
with
a
smile
i
do
not
know
why
you
should
be
either
sorry
or
glad
to
be
both
seems
inexplicable
i
am
sorry
to
lose
it
it
is
the
most
charming
book
i
have
read
and
but
for
patience
i
should
like
to
have
kept
it
for
ever
returned
anna
with
enthusiasm
but
i
always
felt
afraid
of
hester
finding
it
and
carrying
it
up
to
patience
patience
would
be
angry
and
she
might
tell
my
father
that
is
why
i
am
glad
to
give
it
back
to
thee
why
did
you
not
lock
it
up
asked
herbert
i
did
lock
it
up
i
locked
it
in
my
drawer
but
i
forget
to
put
my
keys
in
my
pocket
i
leave
them
about
anywhere
i
should
have
been
out
with
it
sooner
but
that
i
could
not
find
the
keys
anna
was
in
no
momentary
hurry
to
run
in
now
hester
was
safe
for
full
twenty
minutes
to
come
therefore
her
haste
need
not
be
so
great
she
knew
that
it
was
past
her
bedtime
and
that
patience
would
be
wondering
unless
by
great
patience
should
have
dropped
asleep
why
she
did
not
go
in
to
wish
her
good
night
but
these
reflections
anna
conveniently
ignored
in
the
charm
of
remaining
longer
to
talk
about
the
book
she
told
herbert
that
she
had
been
copying
the
engravings
but
she
must
put
the
drawings
in
some
safe
place
before
patience
was
about
again
tell
me
the
time
please
she
suddenly
said
bringing
her
chatter
to
a
standstill
herbert
took
out
his
watch
and
held
its
face
towards
the
moon
it
is
twelve
minutes
past
ten
then
i
must
be
going
in
said
anna
she
could
be
back
in
twenty
minutes
and
she
must
not
find
me
out
again
herbert
turned
with
her
and
walked
to
the
gate
pacing
slowly
both
of
them
and
talking
still
he
turned
in
at
the
gate
with
her
and
anna
made
no
demur
no
fear
of
his
being
seen
patience
was
as
safe
in
bed
as
if
she
had
been
chained
there
and
hester
could
not
be
back
quite
yet
arrived
at
the
door
closed
as
anna
had
left
it
herbert
put
out
his
hand
i
suppose
i
must
bid
you
a
final
good
night
now
anna
he
said
in
low
tones
that
thee
must
i
have
to
come
down
the
garden
again
to
lock
the
gate
after
thee
and
hester
may
not
be
more
than
three
or
four
minutes
longer
good
night
to
thee
herbert
let
me
see
that
it
is
all
safe
for
you
against
you
do
go
in
said
herbert
laying
his
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
door
to
open
it
to
open
it
nay
he
could
not
open
it
the
handle
resisted
his
efforts
did
you
lock
it
anna
anna
smiled
at
what
she
thought
his
awkwardness
thee
art
turning
it
the
wrong
way
herbert
see
he
withdrew
his
hand
to
give
place
to
hers
and
she
turned
the
handle
softly
and
gently
the
contrary
way
that
is
she
essayed
to
turn
it
but
it
would
not
turn
for
her
any
more
than
it
had
turned
for
herbert
dare
a
sick
feeling
of
terror
rushed
over
anna
as
a
conviction
of
the
truth
grew
upon
her
hester
dell
had
returned
and
she
was
locked
out
in
good
truth
it
was
no
less
a
calamity
hester
dell
had
not
gone
far
from
the
door
on
her
errand
when
she
met
the
doctor
boy
with
his
basket
hastening
up
with
the
medicine
i
was
just
coming
after
it
said
hester
to
him
whatever
brings
thee
so
late
parry
was
called
out
this
morning
before
he
had
time
to
make
it
up
and
he
has
only
just
come
home
was
the
boy
reply
better
late
than
never
he
somewhat
saucily
added
well
so
it
is
acquiesced
hester
who
rarely
gave
anything
but
a
meek
retort
and
she
turned
back
home
letting
herself
in
with
the
the
house
appeared
precisely
as
she
had
left
it
except
that
candle
had
disappeared
from
the
mahogany
slab
in
the
passage
right
the
child
gone
to
bed
soliloquised
she
she
proceeded
to
go
to
bed
herself
the
quaker
was
an
early
household
all
hester
had
to
do
now
was
to
give
patience
her
let
me
see
continued
hester
still
in
soliloquy
i
think
i
did
lock
the
back
door
to
make
sure
she
tried
the
key
and
found
it
was
not
locked
rather
wondering
for
she
certainly
thought
she
locked
it
but
dismissing
the
subject
the
next
minute
from
her
thoughts
she
locked
it
now
and
took
the
key
out
then
she
continued
her
way
up
to
patience
patience
lying
there
lonely
and
dull
with
her
turned
her
eyes
on
hester
did
thee
think
we
had
forgotten
thee
patience
parry
has
been
out
all
day
the
boy
says
and
the
physic
is
but
this
minute
come
where
anna
inquired
patience
she
is
gone
to
bed
why
did
she
not
come
to
me
as
usual
did
she
not
come
asked
hester
i
have
seen
nothing
of
her
all
the
evening
maybe
she
thought
thee
be
dozing
observed
hester
bringing
forward
the
which
she
had
been
pouring
into
a
she
said
no
more
her
private
opinion
was
that
anna
had
purposely
abstained
from
the
visit
lest
she
should
receive
a
scolding
for
going
to
bed
late
her
usual
hour
being
nine
neither
did
patience
say
any
more
she
was
feeling
that
anna
might
be
a
little
less
ungrateful
she
took
the
draught
and
hester
went
to
bed
and
poor
anna
to
describe
her
dismay
her
consternation
would
be
a
useless
attempt
the
doors
were
fast
the
windows
were
fast
also
herbert
dare
essayed
to
soothe
her
but
she
would
not
be
soothed
she
sat
down
on
the
step
of
the
back
door
and
cried
bitterly
all
her
apprehension
being
for
the
terrible
scolding
she
should
have
from
patience
were
it
found
out
the
worse
than
scolding
if
patience
told
her
father
to
give
herbert
dare
his
due
he
felt
truly
vexed
at
the
dilemma
for
anna
sake
could
he
have
let
her
in
by
getting
down
a
chimney
himself
or
in
any
other
impromptu
way
and
so
opened
the
door
for
her
he
would
have
done
it
do
cry
anna
he
entreated
do
cry
i
take
care
of
you
nothing
shall
harm
you
i
not
go
away
the
more
he
talked
the
more
she
cried
very
like
a
little
child
had
herbert
dare
known
how
to
break
the
glass
without
noise
he
would
have
taken
out
a
pane
in
the
kitchen
window
and
so
reached
the
fastening
and
opened
it
anna
in
worse
terror
than
ever
begged
him
not
to
attempt
it
it
would
be
sure
to
arouse
hester
but
you
be
so
cold
child
staying
here
all
night
he
urged
you
are
shivering
now
anna
was
shivering
shivering
with
vexation
and
fear
herbert
thought
it
would
be
better
that
he
should
boldly
knock
up
hester
and
he
suggested
it
nay
he
pressed
it
but
the
proposal
sounded
more
alarming
to
anna
than
any
that
had
gone
before
it
it
seemed
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
how
long
she
sat
there
crying
and
shivering
and
refusing
to
be
comforted
or
to
hear
reason
she
could
not
tell
half
the
night
it
seemed
but
anna
you
must
remember
was
counting
time
by
her
own
state
of
mind
not
by
the
clock
suddenly
a
bright
thought
as
a
ray
of
light
flashed
into
her
brain
there
the
pantry
window
she
cried
arresting
her
tears
how
could
i
ever
have
forgotten
it
there
is
no
glass
and
thee
art
strong
enough
to
push
in
the
wire
this
pantry
window
herbert
dare
had
known
nothing
about
it
was
at
the
side
of
the
house
thickly
surrounded
by
shrubs
a
square
window
frame
protected
by
wire
he
fought
his
way
to
it
amidst
the
shrubs
but
to
get
in
proved
a
work
of
time
and
difficulty
the
window
was
at
some
height
from
the
ground
the
wire
was
strong
anna
sat
on
the
never
stirring
leaving
him
to
get
in
if
he
could
her
tears
falling
and
terrific
visions
of
patience
anger
chasing
each
other
through
her
mind
and
the
night
went
on
anna
she
could
have
shouted
forth
a
cry
of
delight
as
she
leaped
up
he
had
entered
had
found
his
way
to
the
kitchen
window
had
gently
raised
it
and
was
softly
calling
to
her
some
little
difficulty
still
but
with
herbert
assistance
she
was
safely
landed
a
great
tear
in
her
dress
the
only
damage
he
had
managed
to
obtain
a
light
by
means
of
some
fusees
in
his
pocket
and
had
lighted
a
candle
anna
sat
down
on
a
chair
her
face
radiant
through
her
tears
how
shall
i
ever
thank
thee
he
was
looking
at
his
fingers
with
a
expression
of
dismay
the
wire
had
torn
them
in
many
places
and
they
were
bleeding
i
could
have
got
in
quicker
had
i
forced
the
wire
out
in
the
middle
he
observed
but
that
would
have
told
tales
i
pushed
it
away
from
the
side
and
have
pushed
it
back
again
into
its
place
as
well
as
i
could
perhaps
it
may
escape
notice
how
shall
i
ever
thank
thee
was
all
anna
could
repeat
in
her
gratitude
now
you
know
what
you
must
do
anna
said
he
i
am
going
to
jump
out
through
the
window
and
be
off
home
you
must
shut
it
and
fasten
it
after
me
i
shut
it
myself
after
i
out
but
that
these
stains
on
my
fingers
would
be
transferred
to
the
frame
and
when
you
leave
the
kitchen
remember
to
turn
the
key
of
the
door
outside
i
found
it
turned
do
you
understand
and
now
farewell
my
little
princess
do
say
i
have
not
worked
wonders
for
you
as
the
good
spirits
do
in
the
fairy
tales
she
caught
his
hand
in
her
glad
delight
she
looked
at
him
with
a
face
full
of
gratitude
herbert
dare
bent
down
and
took
a
kiss
from
the
face
perhaps
he
thought
he
had
fairly
earned
the
reward
then
he
proceeded
to
swing
himself
through
the
window
feeling
delighted
that
he
had
been
able
to
free
anna
from
her
dilemma
before
helstonleigh
arose
next
morning
a
startling
report
was
circulating
through
the
city
the
very
air
teeming
with
it
a
report
that
anthony
dare
had
been
killed
in
the
night
by
his
brother
herbert
chapter
ii
commotion
the
streets
of
helstonleigh
lying
so
still
and
quiet
in
the
moonlight
were
broken
in
upon
by
the
noisy
sound
of
a
carriage
bowling
through
them
a
carriage
that
was
abroad
late
it
wanted
very
little
of
the
time
when
the
church
clocks
would
boom
out
the
two
hours
after
midnight
time
surely
for
all
sober
people
to
be
in
bed
the
carriage
contained
dare
his
wife
and
daughter
they
went
as
you
may
remember
to
a
dinner
party
in
the
country
the
dinner
was
succeeded
by
an
evening
gathering
and
it
was
nearly
one
when
they
left
the
house
to
return
it
wanted
only
five
minutes
to
two
when
the
carriage
stopped
at
their
own
home
and
sleepy
joseph
opened
the
door
to
them
all
in
bed
asked
dare
as
he
bustled
into
the
hall
i
believe
so
sir
answered
joseph
as
carelessly
as
he
could
speak
dare
he
was
aware
alluded
to
his
sons
and
not
being
by
any
means
sure
upon
the
point
joseph
was
willing
to
escape
further
questioning
two
of
the
maids
came
forward
the
lady
maid
as
she
was
called
in
the
family
and
betsy
betsy
was
no
other
than
our
old
friend
betsy
carter
once
the
little
at
halliburton
risen
now
to
be
a
very
fine
housemaid
at
dare
they
had
sat
up
to
attend
upon
dare
and
adelaide
dare
had
been
for
a
long
while
in
the
habit
of
smoking
a
pipe
before
he
went
to
bed
he
would
have
told
you
that
he
could
not
do
without
it
if
business
or
pleasure
took
him
out
he
must
have
his
pipe
when
he
returned
however
late
it
might
be
how
hot
it
is
he
exclaimed
throwing
back
his
coat
leave
the
hall
door
open
joseph
i
sit
outside
bring
me
my
pipe
joseph
looked
for
the
pipe
in
its
appointed
and
could
not
see
it
it
was
a
small
handsome
pipe
with
an
amber
the
was
there
but
joseph
could
see
nothing
of
the
pipe
law
i
remember
exclaimed
betsy
master
left
it
in
the
last
night
and
i
put
it
under
the
sideboard
when
i
was
doing
the
room
this
morning
intending
to
bring
it
away
i
go
and
get
it
taking
the
candle
from
joseph
hand
she
turned
hastily
into
the
not
however
as
hastily
as
she
came
out
of
it
she
rushed
out
uttering
a
succession
of
piercing
shrieks
and
seized
upon
joseph
the
shrieks
echoed
through
the
house
upstairs
and
down
and
dare
came
in
why
what
on
earth
the
matter
girl
cried
he
have
you
seen
a
ghost
oh
sir
oh
joseph
do
let
go
of
me
anthony
lying
in
there
dead
do
be
a
simpleton
responded
dare
staring
at
betsy
joseph
gave
a
rather
less
complimentary
reprimand
and
shook
the
girl
off
but
suddenly
even
as
the
words
left
his
lips
there
rose
up
before
his
mind
eye
the
vision
of
the
past
evening
the
quarrel
the
threats
the
violence
between
anthony
and
herbert
a
strange
apprehension
seated
itself
in
the
man
mind
be
still
you
donkey
he
whispered
to
betsy
his
voice
scarcely
audible
his
manner
subdued
i
go
in
and
see
taking
the
candle
he
went
into
the
dare
followed
the
worst
thought
that
occurred
to
dare
was
that
anthony
might
have
taken
more
wine
than
was
good
for
him
and
had
fallen
down
helpless
in
the
unhappily
anthony
had
been
known
so
to
transgress
only
a
week
or
two
before
but
let
that
pass
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
us
now
dare
followed
joseph
in
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
near
the
window
lay
some
one
on
the
ground
it
was
surely
anthony
he
was
lying
on
his
side
his
head
thrown
back
his
face
a
ghastly
face
which
sent
poor
joseph
pulses
bounding
on
with
a
terrible
fear
as
he
looked
down
at
it
the
same
face
which
had
scared
betsy
when
looked
down
he
is
stark
dead
whispered
joseph
with
a
shiver
to
dare
dare
his
own
seeming
to
have
stopped
bent
over
his
son
by
the
light
of
the
candle
anthony
appeared
to
be
not
only
dead
but
cold
in
his
terrible
shock
his
agitation
he
still
remembered
that
it
was
well
if
possible
to
spare
the
sight
to
his
wife
and
daughter
dare
and
adelaide
alarmed
by
betsy
screams
had
run
downstairs
and
were
now
hastening
into
the
room
go
back
go
back
cried
dare
fencing
them
away
with
his
hands
adelaide
you
must
not
come
in
julia
he
added
to
his
wife
in
tones
of
imploring
entreaty
go
upstairs
and
keep
back
adelaide
he
half
led
half
pushed
them
across
the
hall
dare
had
never
in
all
her
life
seen
his
face
as
she
saw
it
now
a
face
of
terror
she
caught
the
fear
vaguely
enough
it
must
be
confessed
for
she
had
not
heard
anthony
name
as
yet
mentioned
in
connection
with
it
what
is
it
she
asked
holding
on
by
the
balustrades
what
is
there
in
the
i
do
know
what
it
is
replied
dare
from
between
his
white
lips
go
upstairs
adelaide
go
up
with
your
mother
dare
was
stopped
by
more
screams
whilst
he
was
preventing
immediate
terror
to
his
wife
and
daughter
the
lady
maid
her
curiosity
excited
beyond
repression
had
slipped
into
the
and
peeped
over
joseph
shoulder
what
she
had
expected
to
see
she
perhaps
could
not
have
stated
what
she
did
see
was
so
far
worse
than
her
wildest
fears
that
she
lost
sense
of
everything
except
the
moment
fear
and
shriek
after
shriek
echoed
from
her
a
scene
of
confusion
ensued
dare
tried
to
force
her
way
to
the
room
adelaide
followed
her
betsy
began
bewailing
anthony
by
name
in
wild
words
and
the
sleepers
above
came
flocking
out
of
their
chambers
with
trembling
limbs
and
white
faces
dare
put
his
back
against
the
door
girls
go
back
julia
go
back
for
the
love
of
heaven
mademoiselle
is
that
you
be
so
good
as
to
stay
where
you
are
and
keep
rosa
and
minny
with
you
mais
que

exclaimed
mademoiselle
speaking
in
her
wonder
in
her
most
familiar
tongue
and
truth
to
say
paying
little
heed
to
dare
injunction
y
du
malheur
arrivé
betsy
went
up
to
her
betsy
recognised
her
as
one
not
of
the
family
to
whom
she
could
ease
her
overflowing
mind
the
same
thought
had
occurred
to
betsy
as
to
joseph
poor
anthony
lying
in
there
dead
mamzel
she
whispered
herbert
must
have
killed
him
unheeding
the
request
of
dare
unmindful
of
the
deficiences
or
want
of
elegance
in
her
costume
which
consisted
of
what
she
called
a
and
a
borderless
calico
nightcap
mademoiselle
flew
down
to
the
hall
and
slipped
into
the
some
of
the
others
slipped
in
also
and
a
sad
scene
ensued
what
with
wife
governess
servants
and
children
dare
was
powerless
to
end
it
mademoiselle
went
straight
up
gave
one
look
and
staggered
back
against
the
wall
vrai
she
muttered
monsieur
anthony
it
is
anthony
shivered
dare
i
fear
i
fear
violence
has
been
done
him
the
governess
was
breathing
heavily
she
looked
quite
as
ghastly
as
did
that
face
but
why
should
it
be
she
asked
in
english
who
has
done
it
ah
who
had
done
it
joseph
frightened
face
seemed
to
say
that
he
could
tell
if
he
dared
cyril
bounded
into
the
room
and
clasped
one
of
the
arms
but
he
let
it
fall
again
it
is
rigid
he
gasped
is
he
dead
father
he
ca
be
dead
dare
hurried
joseph
from
the
room
hurried
him
across
the
hall
to
the
door
he
dare
seemed
so
agitated
as
scarcely
to
know
what
he
was
about
make
all
haste
he
said
the
nearest
surgeon
sir
whispered
joseph
turning
when
he
was
outside
the
door
his
agitation
as
great
as
his
master
i
afraid
it
herbert
who
has
done
this
why
sharply
asked
dare
they
had
a
dreadful
quarrel
this
evening
sir
after
you
left
herbert
drew
a
knife
upon
his
brother
i
got
in
just
in
time
to
stop
bloodshed
or
it
might
have
happened
then
dare
suppressed
a
groan
go
off
joseph
and
bring
a
doctor
here
he
may
not
be
past
reviving
milbank
is
the
nearest
if
he
is
at
home
bring
him
if
not
get
anybody
joseph
without
his
hat
sped
across
the
lawn
and
gained
the
entrance
gate
at
the
very
moment
that
a
gig
was
passing
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
joseph
saw
that
it
contained
glenn
the
surgeon
driven
by
his
servant
he
had
been
on
a
late
professional
visit
into
the
country
joseph
shouted
running
before
the
horse
in
his
excitement
and
the
man
pulled
up
what
the
matter
joseph
asked
glenn
any
one
ill
somewhat
curious
to
say
glenn
was
the
usual
medical
attendant
of
the
dares
joseph
explained
as
well
as
he
could
anthony
had
been
found
lying
on
the
carpet
to
all
appearance
dead
glenn
descended
anything
up
at
your
place
asked
a
policeman
who
had
just
come
by
on
his
beat
i
should
think
there
is
returned
joseph
one
of
the
been
found
dead
dead
echoed
the
policeman
which
of
them
is
it
he
asked
after
a
pause
mr
anthony
why
i
saw
him
turn
in
here
about
eleven
observed
the
officer
he
is
in
a
fit
perhaps
why
do
you
say
that
asked
joseph
because
he
had
been
taking
a
drop
too
much
he
could
hardly
walk
somebody
brought
him
as
far
as
the
gate
glenn
had
hastened
on
the
policeman
followed
with
joseph
followed
possibly
to
gratify
his
curiosity
possibly
because
he
thought
his
services
might
be
in
some
way
required
when
the
two
entered
the
glenn
was
kneeling
down
to
examine
anthony
and
sounds
of
distress
came
on
their
ears
from
a
distance
they
were
caused
by
the
hysterics
of
dare
is
he
dead
sir
asked
the
policeman
in
a
low
tone
he
has
been
dead
these
two
or
three
hours
was
glenn
reply
but
it
was
not
a
fit
it
was
not
anything
so
innocent
glenn
found
that
the
cause
of
death
was
a
stab
in
the
side
death
he
believed
must
have
been
instantaneous
and
the
hemorrhage
was
chiefly
internal
there
were
very
few
stains
on
the
clothes
what
this
cried
glenn
he
was
pulling
at
some
large
substance
on
which
anthony
had
fallen
it
proved
to
be
a
cloak
cyril
and
some
others
present
recognised
it
as
herbert
cloak
where
was
herbert
in
bed
was
it
possible
that
he
could
sleep
through
the
noise
and
confusion
that
the
house
was
in
can
nothing
be
done
asked
dare
of
the
surgeon
glenn
shook
his
head
he
is
stone
dead
you
see
dead
and
nearly
cold
he
must
have
been
dead
more
than
two
hours
i
should
say
nearer
three
from
two
to
three
hours
then
that
would
bring
the
time
of
his
death
to
about
eleven
close
upon
the
time
that
the
policeman
saw
him
returning
home
some
one
turned
to
ask
the
policeman
a
question
but
he
had
disappeared
glenn
went
to
see
what
he
could
do
for
dare
whose
cries
had
been
painful
to
hear
and
dare
drew
joseph
aside
somehow
he
felt
that
he
not
question
him
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
lest
any
condemnatory
fact
should
transpire
to
bring
the
guilt
home
to
his
second
son
in
spite
of
the
sight
of
anthony
lying
dead
before
him
in
spite
of
what
he
had
heard
of
the
quarrel
he
could
not
bring
his
mind
to
believe
that
herbert
had
been
guilty
of
this
most
dastardly
deed
what
time
did
you
let
him
in
asked
dare
pointing
to
his
son
joseph
answered
evasively
the
policeman
said
it
was
about
half
after
eleven
sir
and
what
time
did
herbert
come
home
in
point
of
fact
but
for
seeing
the
cloak
where
he
did
see
it
joseph
would
not
have
known
whether
herbert
was
at
home
yet
he
felt
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
tell
the
simple
truth
to
dare
that
the
gentlemen
had
been
in
the
habit
of
letting
themselves
in
at
any
hour
they
pleased
the
window
being
left
unfastened
for
them
joseph
made
the
admission
and
dare
received
it
with
anger
i
did
it
by
their
orders
sir
the
man
said
with
deprecation
if
you
think
it
was
wrong
perhaps
you
put
things
on
a
better
footing
for
the
future
but
to
wait
up
every
night
till
its
pretty
near
time
to
rise
again
is
what
i
ca
do
or
anybody
else
flesh
and
blood
is
but
mortal
sir
and
could
stand
it
but
you
were
not
kept
up
like
that
cried
dare
yes
sir
i
was
if
one
of
the
gentlemen
was
out
the
other
would
be
i
told
them
it
was
impossible
i
could
be
up
nearly
all
night
and
every
night
and
rise
in
the
morning
just
the
same
and
do
my
work
in
the
day
so
they
took
to
have
the
window
left
open
and
came
in
that
way
and
i
went
to
rest
at
my
proper
hour
cyril
and
george
too
they
are
taking
to
stay
out
the
house
might
have
been
robbed
over
and
over
again
exclaimed
dare
i
told
them
so
sir
but
they
laughed
at
me
they
said
who
be
likely
to
come
through
the
grounds
and
up
to
the
windows
and
try
them
at
any
rate
sir
added
joseph
as
a
last
excuse
they
it
done
and
that
how
it
is
sir
that
i
do
know
what
time
either
anthony
or
herbert
came
in
last
night
dare
said
no
more
the
fruits
of
the
way
in
which
his
sons
had
been
reared
were
coming
heavily
home
to
him
he
turned
to
go
upstairs
to
herbert
chamber
on
the
bottom
stairs
swaying
herself
to
and
fro
in
her
a
staring
print
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
sat
the
governess
she
lifted
her
white
face
as
dare
approached
is
he
dead
dare
shook
his
head
the
surgeon
says
he
has
been
dead
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
night
and
monsieur
herbert
is
dead
dead
repeated
dare
in
an
accent
of
alarm
fearing
possibly
she
might
have
a
motive
for
the
question
what
should
bring
him
also
dead
mademoiselle
why
do
you
ask
it
eh
me
i
do
know
she
answered
i
am
bewildered
with
it
all
why
should
he
be
dead
and
not
the
other
why
should
either
be
dead
dare
saw
that
she
did
look
bewildered
scarcely
in
her
senses
she
had
a
white
handkerchief
in
her
hand
and
was
wiping
the
moisture
from
her
scarcely
less
white
face
did
you
witness
the
quarrel
between
them
he
inquired
supposing
that
she
had
done
so
by
her
words
if
i
did
i
not
tell
she
vehemently
answered
her
english
less
clear
than
usual
if
joseph
say
i
hear
him
say
it
to
you
just
now
that
monsieur
herbert
took
a
knife
to
his
brother
i
not
give
testimony
to
it
what
affair
is
it
of
mine
that
i
should
tell
against
one
or
the
other
who
did
it
who
killed
him
she
rapidly
continued
it
was
not
monsieur
herbert
no
i
will
say
always
that
it
was
not
monsieur
herbert
he
would
not
kill
his
brother
i
do
not
think
he
would
earnestly
spoke
dare
no
no
no
said
mademoiselle
her
voice
rising
with
her
emphasis
he
never
kill
his
brother
he
not
enough
for
that
perhaps
he
has
not
come
in
cried
dare
catching
at
the
thought
betsy
garter
answered
the
words
she
had
stolen
up
in
the
general
restlessness
and
halted
there
he
must
be
come
in
sir
she
said
else
how
could
his
cloak
be
in
the
they
are
saying
that
it
herbert
cloak
which
was
under
mr
anthony
what
has
herbert
cloak
to
do
with
his
coming
in
or
not
coming
in
sharply
asked
dare
he
would
not
be
wearing
his
cloak
this
weather
but
he
does
wear
it
sir
returned
betsy
he
went
out
in
it
did
you
see
him
sternly
asked
dare
if
i
had
seen
him
i
could
have
told
that
he
went
out
in
it
independently
replied
betsy
who
like
her
mother
was
fond
of
maintaining
her
own
opinion
i
was
looking
out
of
the
window
in
miss
adelaide
room
and
i
saw
herbert
go
out
by
way
of
the
window
towards
the
wearing
his
cloak
wearing
his
cloak
assented
betsy
i
hoped
he
was
hot
enough
in
it
the
words
seemed
to
carry
terrible
conviction
to
dare
mind
unwilling
to
believe
the
girl
he
sought
joseph
and
asked
him
yes
for
certain
joseph
answered
herbert
as
he
was
coming
downstairs
to
go
out
stopped
to
speak
to
me
sir
and
he
was
fastening
his
cloak
on
then
minny
ran
up
bursting
with
grief
and
terror
as
she
seized
upon
dare
papa
papa
is
it
true
she
sobbed
is
what
true
child
that
it
was
herbert
they
are
saying
so
hush
said
dare
carrying
a
candle
he
went
up
to
herbert
room
his
heart
aching
that
herbert
could
sleep
through
the
noise
was
surprising
and
yet
not
much
so
his
room
was
more
remote
from
the
house
than
were
the
other
rooms
and
looked
towards
the
back
but
had
he
slept
through
it
when
dare
went
in
he
was
sitting
up
in
bed
awaking
or
pretending
to
awake
from
sleep
the
window
thrown
wide
open
may
have
contributed
to
deaden
any
sound
in
the
house
can
you
sleep
through
this
herbert
cried
dare
herbert
stared
and
rubbed
his
eyes
and
stared
again
as
one
bewildered
is
that
you
father
he
presently
cried
what
is
it
herbert
said
his
father
in
low
tones
of
pain
of
dread
what
have
you
been
doing
to
your
brother
herbert
as
if
not
understanding
the
drift
of
the
question
stared
more
than
ever
i
have
done
nothing
to
him
he
presently
said
do
you
mean
anthony
anthony
is
lying
on
the
floor
killed
murdered
herbert
did
herbert
dare
sat
motionless
in
bed
looking
utterly
lost
that
he
could
not
understand
or
was
affecting
not
to
understand
was
evident
anthony
is
what
do
you
say
sir
he
is
dead
he
is
replied
dare
oh
my
son
my
son
say
you
did
not
do
it
for
the
love
of
heaven
say
you
did
not
do
it
and
the
unhappy
father
burst
into
tears
and
sank
down
on
the
bed
utterly
unmanned
chapter
iii
accused
the
grey
dawn
of
the
early
may
morning
was
breaking
over
the
world
over
the
group
gathered
in
dare
that
gentleman
his
surviving
sons
a
stranger
a
constable
or
two
and
sergeant
delves
who
had
been
summoned
to
the
scene
sundry
of
the
household
were
going
in
and
out
of
their
own
restless
curious
accord
or
by
summons
the
sergeant
was
making
inquiries
into
the
facts
and
details
of
the
evening
anthony
dare
as
may
be
remembered
had
sullenly
retired
to
his
room
refusing
to
go
out
when
the
message
came
to
him
from
lord
hawkesley
it
appeared
by
what
was
afterwards
learnt
that
he
anthony
dare
had
made
an
appointment
to
meet
hawkesley
and
some
other
men
at
the
hotel
where
lord
hawkesley
was
staying
the
proposed
amusement
of
the
evening
being
cards
anthony
dare
remained
in
his
chamber
solacing
his
chafed
temper
with
until
the
waiter
from
the
appeared
a
second
time
bearing
a
note
this
note
sergeant
delves
had
found
in
one
of
the
pockets
and
had
it
now
open
before
him
it
ran
as
follows
dear
dare
we
are
all
here
waiting
and
ca
make
up
the
tables
without
you
what
do
you
mean
by
shirking
us
come
along
and
do
be
a
month
over
yours
hawkesley
this
note
had
prevailed
anthony
possibly
repenting
of
the
solitary
evening
to
which
he
had
condemned
himself
put
on
his
boots
again
and
went
forth
not
it
is
not
pleasant
to
have
to
record
it
but
it
can
not
be
concealed
not
sober
he
had
taken
ale
with
his
dinner
wine
after
it
and
in
his
room
the
three
combined
had
told
upon
him
on
his
arrival
at
the
he
found
six
or
seven
gentlemen
assembled
but
instead
of
sitting
down
there
in
lord
hawkesley
room
it
was
suddenly
decided
to
adjourn
to
the
lodgings
of
a
brittle
hard
by
a
young
oxonian
who
had
been
plucked
in
his
little
go
and
was
supposed
to
be
reading
hard
to
avoid
a
second
similar
catastrophe
they
went
to
brittle
and
sat
down
to
cards
over
which
and
other
drinks
were
introduced
anthony
dare
by
way
of
quenching
his
thirst
did
not
spare
them
and
was
not
particular
as
to
the
sorts
the
consequence
was
that
he
soon
became
most
disagreeable
company
snarling
with
all
around
in
short
unfit
for
play
this
put
the
rest
of
the
party
out
of
sorts
and
they
broke
up
but
for
that
they
might
probably
have
sat
on
until
morning
and
that
poor
unhappy
life
have
been
spared
there
was
no
knowing
what
might
have
been
anthony
dare
was
in
no
fit
state
to
walk
alone
and
one
of
them
brittle
undertook
to
see
him
home
brittle
left
him
at
the
gate
and
anthony
dare
stumbled
over
the
lawn
and
gained
the
house
after
that
nothing
further
was
known
so
much
as
this
would
not
have
been
known
but
that
in
hastening
for
delves
the
policeman
had
come
across
brittle
it
was
only
natural
that
the
latter
shocked
and
startled
should
bend
his
steps
to
the
scene
and
from
him
they
gathered
the
account
of
movements
abroad
but
now
came
the
difficulty
who
had
let
anthony
in
no
one
there
was
little
doubt
that
he
had
made
his
way
through
the
window
joseph
had
turned
the
key
of
the
front
door
at
eleven
and
he
had
not
been
called
upon
to
open
it
until
the
return
of
and
dare
the
policeman
who
happened
to
be
passing
when
anthony
came
home
or
it
may
be
more
correct
to
say
was
brought
home
testified
to
the
probable
fact
that
he
had
entered
by
means
of
the
window
the
man
had
watched
him
had
seen
that
instead
of
making
for
the
front
door
which
faced
the
road
and
was
in
view
he
had
stumbled
across
the
grass
and
disappeared
down
by
the
side
of
the
house
on
this
side
the
window
was
situated
therefore
it
was
only
reasonable
to
suppose
that
anthony
had
so
entered
had
you
any
motive
in
watching
him
asked
sergeant
delves
of
this
man
none
except
to
see
that
he
did
not
fall
was
the
reply
when
the
gentleman
who
brought
him
home
loosed
his
arm
he
told
him
in
a
joking
way
not
to
get
kissing
the
ground
as
he
went
in
and
i
thought
watch
him
that
i
might
go
to
his
assistance
if
he
did
fall
he
could
hardly
walk
he
pitched
about
with
every
step
did
he
fall
no
he
managed
to
keep
up
but
i
should
think
he
was
a
good
five
minutes
getting
over
the
grass
plat
did
the
gentleman
remain
to
watch
him
no
not
for
above
a
minute
he
just
waited
to
see
that
he
got
safe
over
the
gravel
path
on
to
the
grass
and
then
he
went
back
did
you
see
anyone
else
come
in
about
that
time
or
before
it
or
after
it
the
man
shook
his
head
i
did
see
anyone
else
at
all
i
shut
the
gate
after
anthony
and
i
did
see
it
opened
again
not
but
what
plenty
might
have
opened
and
shut
it
and
gone
in
too
when
i
was
higher
up
my
beat
sergeant
delves
called
joseph
it
appears
uncommonly
odd
that
you
should
have
heard
no
noise
whatever
he
observed
a
man
movements
are
not
generally
very
quiet
when
in
the
state
described
as
being
that
of
young
dare
the
probability
is
that
he
would
enter
the
noisily
he
be
nearly
sure
to
fall
against
the
furniture
being
in
the
dark
it
certain
that
i
never
did
hear
him
replied
joseph
we
was
shut
up
in
the
kitchen
and
i
was
mostly
nodding
from
the
time
i
locked
up
at
eleven
till
master
came
home
at
two
the
two
girls
was
chattering
loud
enough
they
was
at
the
table
caps
or
something
of
that
the
cook
went
to
bed
at
ten
she
was
tired
then
with
the
exception
of
you
three
all
the
household
were
in
bed
all
of
as
was
at
home
answered
joseph
the
governess
had
gone
early
the
two
young
ladies
went
about
ten
cyril
and
george
went
soon
after
ten
they
came
home
from
cricket
beat
they
said
had
supper
and
went
to
bed
soon
after
it
it
not
usual
for
them
the
young
men
i
mean
to
go
to
bed
so
early
is
it
asked
sergeant
delves
no
except
on
cricket
nights
answered
joseph
after
cricket
they
generally
come
home
and
have
supper
and
do
go
out
again
other
nights
they
are
mostly
sure
to
be
out
late
and
you
did
not
hear
herbert
come
in
sergeant
delves
i
say
that
i
never
heard
nothing
nor
nobody
from
the
time
i
locked
the
front
door
till
master
and
missis
came
home
reiterated
joseph
growing
angry
let
me
repeat
it
ten
times
over
i
could
say
it
plainer
if
i
had
heard
either
of
the
gentlemen
come
in
i
should
have
gone
to
to
see
if
anything
was
wanted
specially
to
anthony
knowing
that
he
was
not
sober
when
he
went
out
two
points
appeared
more
particularly
to
strike
sergeant
delves
the
one
was
that
no
noise
should
have
been
heard
that
a
deed
like
this
could
have
been
committed
in
as
it
appeared
absolute
silence
the
other
was
that
the
window
should
have
been
found
fastened
inside
the
latter
fact
confirmed
the
strong
suspicion
that
the
offender
was
an
inmate
of
the
house
a
person
not
an
inmate
of
the
house
would
naturally
have
escaped
by
the
open
window
but
to
do
this
to
fasten
it
inside
after
him
was
an
impossibility
every
other
window
in
the
house
every
door
had
been
securely
fastened
some
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
some
at
eleven
by
joseph
herbert
dare
voluntarily
acknowledged
that
it
was
he
who
had
fastened
the
window
his
own
account
was
and
the
sergeant
looked
at
him
narrowly
while
he
gave
it
that
he
had
returned
home
late
getting
on
for
two
that
he
had
come
in
through
the
and
had
put
down
the
window
fastening
he
declared
that
he
had
not
seen
anthony
if
anthony
had
been
lying
there
as
he
was
afterwards
found
he
herbert
had
not
observed
him
but
he
said
so
far
as
he
remembered
he
never
glanced
to
that
part
of
the
room
at
all
but
had
gone
straight
through
on
the
other
side
between
the
table
and
the
fireplace
and
if
he
had
glanced
to
it
he
could
have
seen
nothing
for
the
room
was
dark
he
had
no
light
and
had
to
feel
his
way
was
it
usual
for
the
young
gentlemen
to
fasten
the
window
sergeant
delves
asked
of
joseph
and
joseph
replied
that
they
sometimes
did
sometimes
did
not
if
by
any
chance
anthony
and
herbert
came
in
together
then
they
would
fasten
it
or
if
when
the
one
came
in
he
knew
that
the
other
was
not
out
he
would
equally
fasten
it
cyril
and
george
did
not
often
come
in
that
way
in
fact
they
were
not
out
so
late
generally
speaking
as
were
their
brothers
precisely
so
herbert
assented
with
reference
to
the
fastening
he
had
fastened
it
believing
his
brother
anthony
to
be
at
home
and
in
bed
when
he
went
out
the
previous
evening
anthony
had
already
gone
to
his
room
expressing
his
intention
not
to
leave
it
again
that
night
sergeant
delves
inquired
no
doubt
for
reasons
of
his
own
whether
this
expressed
intention
on
the
part
of
anthony
could
be
testified
to
by
any
one
besides
herbert
yes
by
joseph
by
the
governess
by
rosa
and
minny
dare
all
four
had
heard
him
say
it
the
sergeant
would
not
trouble
the
young
ladies
but
requested
to
speak
to
the
governess
the
governess
was
indignant
at
the
request
being
made
she
was
in
and
out
amongst
them
with
her
white
face
in
her
she
had
been
upstairs
and
partially
dressed
herself
had
discarded
the
calico
nightcap
and
done
her
hair
put
on
the
again
and
come
down
to
see
and
to
listen
but
she
did
not
like
being
questioned
i
know
nothing
about
it
she
said
to
the
sergeant
speaking
vehemently
what
should
i
know
about
it
i
will
tell
you
nothing
i
went
to
bed
before
it
was
well
nine
i
had
a
headache
and
i
never
heard
anything
more
till
the
commotion
began
why
you
ask
me
but
you
can
surely
tell
whether
or
not
you
heard
anthony
say
he
was
going
to
his
chamber
for
the
night
remonstrated
the
sergeant
yes
he
did
say
it
she
answered
vehemently
he
said
it
in
the
salon
he
kicked
off
his
boots
and
told
joseph
to
bring
his
slippers
and
to
take
to
his
room
for
he
should
not
leave
it
again
that
night
i
never
thought
or
knew
that
he
had
left
it
until
i
saw
him
lying
in
the
and
they
said
he
was
dead
was
herbert
present
when
he
said
he
should
go
to
his
room
for
the
night
he
was
present
i
think
i
think
he
had
come
in
then
to
the
salon
that
is
all
i
know
i
made
the
tea
and
then
my
head
got
bad
and
i
went
to
bed
i
can
tell
you
nothing
further
did
you
hear
any
noise
in
the
house
no
if
there
was
any
noise
i
did
not
notice
it
i
soon
went
to
sleep
where
is
the
use
of
your
asking
me
these
things
you
should
ask
those
who
sat
up
i
shall
be
sick
if
you
make
me
talk
about
it
nothing
of
this
ever
arrived
in
any
family
where
i
have
been
before
the
sergeant
allowed
her
to
retire
she
went
to
the
stairs
and
sat
down
on
the
lower
step
and
leaned
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
all
as
she
had
done
previously
dare
asked
her
why
she
did
not
go
upstairs
away
from
the
confusion
and
bustle
of
the
sad
scene
but
she
shook
her
head
she
did
not
care
to
be
in
her
chamber
alone
she
answered
and
her
pupils
were
shut
in
with
madame
dare
and
mademoiselle
adelaide
it
is
possible
that
one
thing
puzzled
the
sergeant
though
what
puzzled
him
and
what
did
not
puzzle
him
had
to
be
left
to
conjecture
for
he
said
nothing
about
it
no
weapon
had
been
found
the
policemen
had
been
searching
the
room
thoroughly
had
partly
searched
the
house
but
had
come
upon
no
instrument
likely
to
have
inflicted
the
wound
a
or
common
had
been
suggested
remembering
the
previous
occurrences
of
the
evening
but
glenn
decided
opinion
was
that
it
must
have
been
a
very
different
instrument
some
slender
blade
he
thought
about
six
inches
in
length
the
most
suspicious
evidence
referring
to
herbert
was
the
cloak
the
sergeant
had
examined
it
curiously
with
compressed
lips
herbert
disposed
of
this
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
that
is
if
he
was
to
be
believed
he
said
that
he
had
put
his
cloak
on
had
gone
out
in
it
as
far
as
the
entrance
gate
but
finding
it
warmer
than
was
agreeable
he
had
turned
back
and
flung
it
on
to
the
table
going
in
as
he
had
come
out
through
the
window
he
added
as
a
little
bit
of
confirmatory
evidence
that
he
remembered
seeing
the
cloak
begin
to
slide
off
the
table
again
that
he
saw
it
must
fall
to
the
ground
but
being
in
a
hurry
he
would
not
stop
to
prevent
its
doing
so
or
to
pick
it
up
the
sergeant
never
seemed
to
take
his
sidelong
glance
from
herbert
dare
he
had
gone
to
work
in
his
own
way
hearing
the
different
accounts
and
conjectures
sifting
this
bit
of
evidence
turning
about
that
holding
a
whispered
colloquy
with
the
man
who
had
been
sent
to
examine
room
holding
a
longer
whispered
colloquy
with
herbert
himself
on
the
departure
of
the
surgeon
and
brittle
who
had
gone
away
together
he
had
marched
to
the
front
and
side
doors
of
the
house
locked
them
and
put
the
keys
into
his
pocket
nobody
goes
out
of
this
without
my
permission
quoth
he
then
he
took
dare
aside
there
no
mistake
about
this
i
fear
said
he
gravely
dare
knew
what
he
meant
he
himself
was
growing
grievously
but
he
would
not
say
so
he
would
not
allow
it
to
be
seen
that
he
cast
or
could
cast
a
suspicion
on
herbert
it
appears
to
me
that
that
if
poor
anthony
was
in
the
state
they
describe
that
he
may
have
sat
down
or
laid
down
after
entering
the
and
dropped
asleep
observed
dare
easy
then
the
window
being
left
open
for
some
midnight
housebreaker
from
the
street
to
have
come
in
and
attacked
him
pooh
said
sergeant
delves
it
is
no
housebreaker
that
has
done
this
we
have
a
difficult
line
of
duty
to
perform
at
times
us
police
and
all
we
can
do
to
soften
matters
is
to
go
to
work
as
genteelly
as
is
consistent
with
the
law
i
sorry
to
have
to
say
it
dare
but
i
have
felt
obliged
to
order
my
men
to
keep
a
on
mr
herbert
a
chill
ran
through
dare
it
could
not
have
been
herbert
he
rejoined
his
tone
one
of
pain
almost
of
entreaty
glenn
says
it
could
not
have
been
done
later
than
eleven
or
so
herbert
never
came
home
until
nearly
two
who
is
to
prove
that
he
was
not
at
home
till
near
two
he
says
he
was
not
i
have
no
doubt
it
can
be
proved
and
poor
anthony
was
dead
more
than
two
hours
before
now
look
you
here
cried
sergeant
delves
falling
back
on
a
favourite
phrase
of
his
glenn
is
correct
enough
as
to
the
time
of
the
occurrence
i
have
had
some
experience
in
death
myself
and
i
sure
he
is
not
far
out
but
let
that
pass
here
are
witnesses
who
saw
him
alive
at
eleven
and
you
come
home
at
two
and
find
him
dead
now
let
your
son
herbert
thus
state
where
he
was
from
eleven
till
two
he
says
he
was
out
not
near
home
at
all
very
good
only
let
him
mention
the
place
so
that
we
can
verify
it
and
find
beyond
dispute
that
he
out
and
the
suspicion
against
him
will
be
at
an
end
but
he
wo
do
this
not
do
it
echoed
dare
he
tells
me
that
he
ca
and
he
wo
i
asked
him
dare
turned
impetuously
to
the
room
where
he
had
left
his
second
son
his
eldest
son
now
here
herbert
he
was
beginning
but
the
officer
cut
short
the
words
by
drawing
him
back
do
go
and
make
matters
worse
whispered
he
perhaps
they
be
bad
enough
without
it
now
lawyer
dare
you
do
well
not
to
turn
obstinate
for
i
am
giving
you
a
bit
of
friendly
advice
you
and
i
have
had
many
a
transaction
together
and
i
do
mind
going
a
bit
out
of
my
way
for
you
as
i
would
do
for
other
people
the
worst
thing
your
son
could
do
would
be
to
say
before
those
chattering
servants
that
he
or
wo
tell
where
he
has
been
all
night
or
half
the
night
it
would
be
at
once
ask
him
in
private
if
you
must
ask
him
dare
called
his
son
to
him
and
herbert
answered
to
it
a
policeman
was
sauntering
after
him
but
the
sergeant
gave
him
a
nod
and
the
man
went
back
herbert
you
say
you
did
not
come
in
until
near
two
this
morning
neither
did
i
it
wanted
about
twenty
minutes
to
it
the
churches
struck
one
as
i
came
through
the
town
where
did
you
stay
well
i
ca
say
replied
herbert
dare
grew
agitated
you
must
say
herbert
he
hoarsely
whispered
or
take
the
consequences
i
ca
help
the
consequences
was
herbert
answer
where
i
was
last
night
is
no
matter
to
any
one
and
i
shall
not
say
your
not
saying
if
you
can
say
is
just
folly
interposed
the
sergeant
it
the
first
question
the
magistrates
will
ask
when
you
are
placed
before
them
herbert
looked
up
angrily
place
me
before
the
magistrates
he
echoed
what
do
you
mean
you
will
not
dare
to
take
me
into
custody
you
have
been
in
custody
this
coolly
returned
the
sergeant
herbert
looked
terribly
fierce
i
will
not
submit
to
this
indignity
he
exclaimed
will
sergeant
delves
you
are
overstepping
look
here
interrupted
the
sergeant
drawing
something
from
some
unseen
receptacle
and
herbert
to
his
dismay
caught
sight
of
a
pair
of
handcuffs
do
you
force
me
to
use
them
said
the
officer
you
are
in
custody
and
must
go
before
the
magistrates
but
now
you
be
a
gentleman
and
i
use
you
as
one
i
protest
upon
my
honour
that
i
have
had
neither
act
nor
part
in
this
crime
cried
herbert
in
agitation
do
you
think
i
would
stain
my
hand
with
the
sin
of
cain
what
is
that
on
your
hand
asked
the
sergeant
bending
forward
to
look
more
closely
at
herbert
fingers
herbert
held
them
out
openly
enough
i
was
doing
something
last
night
which
tore
my
fingers
he
said
i
was
trying
to
undo
the
fastenings
of
some
wire
sergeant
delves
i
declare
to
you
solemnly
that
from
the
moment
when
my
brother
went
to
his
chamber
as
witnesses
have
stated
to
you
i
never
saw
him
until
my
father
brought
me
down
from
my
bed
to
see
him
lying
dead
you
drew
a
knife
on
him
not
many
hours
before
you
know
mr
herbert
it
was
done
in
the
heat
of
passion
he
provoked
me
very
much
but
i
should
not
have
used
it
no
poor
fellow
i
should
never
have
injured
him
well
you
only
make
your
tale
good
to
the
magistrates
was
all
the
sergeant
answer
it
will
be
their
affair
as
soon
as
you
are
before
them
not
mine
herbert
dare
was
handed
back
to
the
constable
and
as
soon
as
the
opened
was
conveyed
before
the
magistrates
all
as
the
sergeant
termed
it
in
a
genteel
gentlemanly
sort
of
way
he
was
charged
with
the
murder
of
his
brother
anthony
to
describe
the
commotion
that
spread
over
helstonleigh
would
be
beyond
any
pen
the
college
boys
were
in
a
strange
state
of
excitement
both
anthony
and
herbert
dare
had
been
college
boys
themselves
not
so
very
long
ago
gar
halliburton
who
was
no
longer
a
college
boy
but
a
supernumerary
went
home
full
of
it
having
imparted
it
there
he
thought
he
could
not
do
better
than
go
in
and
regale
patience
with
the
news
by
way
of
to
her
sick
bed

i
come

he
called
out

she

great
glee

my
father

only
on
his
tale
the
town
is
all
up
in
arms
you
never
saw
such
an
uproar
when
we
came
out
of
school
just
now
we
thought
the
french
must
have
come
to
invade
us
by
the
crowds
there
were
in
the
street
you
could
get
near
the
guildhall
where
the
examination
was
going
on
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
of
us
were
able
to
fight
our
way
in
herbert
dare
looked
so
pale
he
was
standing
there
guarded
by
three
policemen

a
quarrel
yesterday
and
it
came
to
knives
they
were
parted

night

chapter
iv
committed
for
trial
helstonleigh
could
not
recover
its
equanimity
never
had
it
been
so
rudely
shaken
incidents
there
had
been
as
startling
crimes
of
as
deep
a
dye
but
taking
it
with
all
its
attendant
circumstances
no
occurrence
in
the
memory
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
had
excited
the
interest
that
was
attaching
to
the
death
and
assumed
murder
of
anthony
dare
the
social
standing
of
the
parties
above
that
in
which
such
unhappy
incidents
are
more
generally
found
the
conspicuous
position
they
occupied
in
the
town
and
the
very
uncertainty
the
mystery
it
may
be
said
in
which
the
affair
was
wrapped
wrought
local
curiosity
to
the
highest
point
scarcely
a
shadow
of
doubt
rested
on
the
public
mind
that
the
deed
had
been
done
by
herbert
dare
the
police
force
actively
engaged
in
searching
out
all
the
details
held
the
same
opinion
in
one
sense
this
was
perhaps
unfortunate
for
when
strong
suspicion
whether
of
the
police
or
of
the
public
is
especially
directed
to
one
isolated
point
it
inevitably
tends
to
keep
down
doubts
that
might
arise
in
regard
to
other
quarters
it
seemed
scarcely
possible
to
hope
that
herbert
was
not
guilty
all
the
facts
tended
to
the
assumption
that
he
was
so
there
was
the
known
to
have
existed
between
himself
and
his
brother
the
quarrel
and
violence
in
the
not
many
hours
before
in
which
quarrel
herbert
raised
a
knife
upon
him
but
for
the
entrance
of
the
servant
joseph
said
the
people
one
to
another
the
murder
might
have
been
done
then
joseph
had
stopped
evil
consequences
at
the
time
but
he
had
not
stopped
herbert
mouth
the
threat
he
had
uttered
in
his
passion
still
to
be
revenged
terribly
those
words
told
now
against
herbert
dare
another
thing
that
told
against
him
and
in
a
most
forcible
manner
was
the
cloak
that
he
had
put
it
on
to
go
out
nay
had
been
seen
to
go
out
in
it
by
the
housemaid
was
indisputable
and
his
brother
was
found
lying
on
this
very
cloak
in
vain
herbert
protested
when
before
the
magistrates
and
at
the
coroner
inquest
that
he
returned
before
leaving
the
gates
and
had
flung
this
cloak
into
the
finding
it
too
hot
that
evening
to
wear
he
obtained
no
credit
he
had
not
been
seen
to
do
this
and
the
word
of
an
accused
man
goes
for
little
all
ominous
these
things
all
telling
against
him
but
nothing
taking
them
collectively
as
compared
with
his
refusal
to
state
where
he
was
that
night
he
left
the
house
between
eight
and
nine
close
upon
nine
he
thought
he
was
not
sure
of
the
exact
time
to
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
he
never
returned
to
it
until
nearly
two
such
was
his
account
but
where
he
had
been
in
the
interim
he
positively
refused
to
state
it
was
only
his
assertion
you
see
against
the
broad
basis
of
suspicion
anthony
dare
death
must
have
taken
place
as
testified
by
glenn
somewhere
about
eleven
who
was
to
prove
that
herbert
at
that
time
was
not
at
home
i
was
not
herbert
reiterated
when
before
the
coroner
i
did
not
return
home
till
between
one
and
two
the
churches
struck
the
as
i
was
coming
through
the
town
and
it
would
take
me
afterwards
some
ten
minutes
to
reach
home
it
must
have
been
about
twenty
minutes
to
two
when
i
entered
but
where
were
you
where
had
you
been
where
did
you
come
from
he
was
asked
that
i
can
not
state
he
replied
i
was
out
upon
a
little
business
of
my
own
business
that
concerns
no
one
but
myself
and
i
decline
to
make
it
public
on
that
score
nothing
more
could
be
obtained
from
him
the
coroner
drew
his
own
conclusions
the
jury
drew
the
police
had
already
drawn
theirs
and
very
positive
ones
these
were
the
two
facts
that
excited
the
ire
of
sergeant
delves
and
his
official
colleagues
with
all
their
searching
they
could
find
no
weapon
likely
to
have
been
the
one
used
and
they
could
not
discover
where
herbert
dare
had
gone
to
that
evening
it
happened
that
no
one
remembered
to
have
seen
him
passing
in
the
town
early
or
late
or
if
they
had
seen
him
it
had
made
no
impression
on
their
memory
the
appearance
of
dare
sons
was
so
common
an
occurrence
that
no
especial
note
was
likely
to
have
been
taken
of
it
herbert
declared
that
in
passing
through
west
street
turtle
the
auctioneer
was
leaning
out
at
his
open
bedroom
window
and
that
he
herbert
had
called
out
to
him
and
asked
whether
he
was
mr
turtle
when
applied
to
could
not
corroborate
this
he
believed
that
he
been
looking
out
at
his
window
that
night
he
believed
that
it
might
have
been
about
the
hour
named
getting
on
for
two
for
he
was
late
going
to
bed
having
been
to
a
supper
party
but
he
had
no
recollection
whatever
of
seeing
herbert
pass
or
of
having
been
spoken
to
by
him
or
by
any
one
else
when
pressed
upon
the
point
mr
turtle
acknowledged
that
his
intellects
might
not
have
been
in
the
clearest
state
of
perception
the
supper
party
having
been
a
jovial
one
one
of
the
jury
remarked
that
it
was
very
singular
the
prisoner
could
go
through
the
and
not
observe
his
brother
lying
in
it
the
prisoner
replied
that
it
was
not
singular
at
all
the
room
was
in
darkness
and
he
had
felt
his
way
through
it
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
to
that
where
his
brother
was
afterwards
found
he
had
gone
straight
through
and
up
to
his
chamber
as
quietly
as
possible
not
to
disturb
the
house
and
he
dropped
asleep
as
soon
as
he
was
in
bed
the
verdict
returned
was
wilful
murder
against
herbert
dare
and
he
was
committed
to
the
county
gaol
to
take
his
trial
at
the
assizes
dare
house
was
beyond
the
precincts
of
the
city
sergeant
delves
and
his
men
renewed
their
inquiries
but
they
could
discover
no
trace
either
of
the
weapon
or
of
where
herbert
dare
had
passed
the
suspicious
hours
the
sergeant
was
vexed
but
he
would
not
allow
that
he
was
beaten
only
give
us
time
said
he
with
a
characteristic
nod
the
pyramids
of
egypt
were
only
built
up
stone
by
stone
tuesday
morning
the
morning
fixed
for
the
funeral
of
anthony
dare
the
curious
portion
of
helstonleigh
wended
its
way
up
to
the
churchyard
as
it
is
the
delight
of
the
curious
portion
of
a
town
to
do
what
a
sad
sight
it
was
that
dark
object
covered
by
its
pall
carried
by
its
attendants
followed
by
the
mourners
dare
and
his
sons
cyril
and
george
he
the
father
bent
his
face
in
his
handkerchief
as
he
walked
behind
the
coffin
to
the
grave
many
a
man
in
helstonleigh
enjoyed
a
higher
share
of
esteem
and
respect
than
did
lawyer
dare
but
not
one
present
in
that
crowded
churchyard
that
did
not
feel
for
him
in
his
bitter
grief
not
one
let
us
hope
that
did
not
feel
to
his
core
the
fate
of
the
unhappy
anthony
now
for
weal
or
for
woe
to
answer
before
his
maker
for
his
life
on
earth
that
same
day
tuesday
witnessed
the
return
of
samuel
lynn
and
william
halliburton
they
arrived
in
the
evening
and
of
course
the
first
news
they
were
greeted
with
was
the
prevailing
topic
few
things
caused
the
quaker
to
betray
surprise
but
william
was
with
the
news
anthony
dare
dead
murdered
buried
that
very
day
and
herbert
in
prison
awaiting
his
trial
for
the
offence
to
william
the
whole
affair
seemed
more
incredible
than
real
sir
he
said
to
his
master
when
the
following
morning
they
were
alone
together
in
the
at
the
manufactory
do
you
believe
herbert
dare
can
be
guilty
ashley
had
been
gazing
at
william
lost
in
thought
the
change
we
often
see
or
fancy
we
see
in
a
near
friend
after
a
few
absence
was
apparent
in
william
he
had
improved
in
looks
and
yet
those
looks
with
their
true
nobility
both
of
form
and
intellect
had
been
scarcely
capable
of
improvement
nevertheless
it
was
there
and
ashley
had
been
struck
with
it
i
can
not
say
he
replied
aroused
by
the
question
facts
appear
conclusively
against
him
but
it
seems
incredible
that
he
should
so
have
lost
himself
to
be
suspected
and
committed
on
such
a
charge
is
grief
enough
without
the
reality
of
guilt
so
it
is
acquiesced
william
we
feel
the
disgrace
very
keenly
as
all
must
who
are
connected
with
the
dares
in
ever
so
remote
a
degree
feel
it
william
feel
it
as
a
blow
ashley
is
the
cousin
of
anthony
dare
they
are
relatives
of
ours
also
said
william
in
a
low
tone
my
father
was
first
cousin
to
mrs
dare
ashley
looked
at
him
with
surprise
your
father
first
cousin
to
mrs
dare
he
repeated
what
are
you
saying
her
first
cousin
sir
you
have
heard
of
old
cooper
of
birmingham
from
whom
the
dares
inherited
their
money
well
cooper
had
a
brother
and
a
sister
dare
was
the
daughter
of
the
brother
the
sister
married
the
reverend
william
halliburton
and
my
father
was
their
son
dare
as
julia
cooper
and
my
father
edgar
halliburton
both
lived
together
for
some
time
under
their
uncle
roof
at
birmingham
a
moment
pause
and
then
ashley
laid
his
hand
on
shoulder
then
that
brings
a
sort
of
relationship
between
us
william
i
shall
have
a
right
to
feel
pride
in
you
now
william
laughed
but
his
cheek
flushed
with
the
pleasure
of
a
more
earnest
feeling
his
greatest
earthly
wish
was
to
be
appreciated
by
ashley
how
is
it
i
never
heard
of
this
relationship
before
cried
ashley
was
it
purposely
concealed
it
is
only
within
a
year
or
two
that
i
have
known
of
it
replied
william
frank
and
gar
are
not
aware
of
it
yet
when
we
first
came
to
helstonleigh
the
dares
were
much
annoyed
at
it
and
they
made
it
known
to
my
mother
in
so
unmistakable
a
manner
that
she
resolved
to
drop
all
mention
of
the
relationship
she
would
have
dropped
the
relationship
itself
if
she
could
have
done
so
it
was
natural
perhaps
that
they
should
feel
annoyed
continued
william
seeking
to
apologize
for
them
they
were
rich
and
great
in
the
eyes
of
the
town
we
were
poor
and
obscure
ashley
was
casting
his
recollections
backwards
a
certain
event
which
had
always
somewhat
puzzled
him
was
becoming
clear
now
william
when
anthony
dare
acting
as
he
said
for
me
put
that
seizure
into
your
house
for
rent
it
must
have
been
done
with
the
view
of
driving
you
from
the
town
my
mother
says
she
has
always
thought
so
sir
i
see
i
see
why
william
half
the
inheritance
enjoyed
by
the
dares
ought
justly
to
have
been
your
father
we
shall
do
as
well
without
it
in
the
sir
replied
william
a
bright
smile
illumining
his
face
hard
though
the
struggle
was
at
the
beginning
ay
that
you
will
warmly
returned
ashley
the
ways
of
providence
are
wonderful
yes
william
and
i
know
you
have
been
taught
to
think
so
what
men
call
the
chances
of
the
world
are
all
god
dealings
reflect
on
the
circumstances
favouring
the
dares
reflect
on
your
own
drawbacks
and
disadvantages
they
had
wealth
position
a
lucrative
profession
everything
in
fact
to
help
them
on
that
can
be
desired
by
a
family
in
life
whilst
you
had
poverty
obscurity
and
toil
to
contend
with
but
now
look
at
what
they
are
dare
money
is
dissipated
he
is
overwhelmed
with
embarrassment
i
know
it
to
be
a
fact
william
but
this
is
for
your
ear
alone
folly
recklessness
irreligion
reign
in
his
house
his
daughters
lost
in
pretentious
vanity
his
sons
in
something
worse
in
a
few
years
they
will
have
gone
down
down
yes
added
ashley
pointing
with
his
finger
to
the
floor
of
his
down
to
the
dogs
i
can
see
it
coming
as
surely
as
that
the
sun
is
in
the
heavens
you
and
they
will
have
exchanged
positions
william
nay
you
and
yours
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
will
be
in
a
far
higher
position
than
they
have
ever
occupied
for
you
will
have
secured
the
favour
of
god
and
the
approbation
of
all
good
men
that
frank
and
gar
will
attain
to
a
position
in
time
i
should
be
worse
than
a
heathen
to
doubt
looking
back
on
the
wonderful
manner
in
which
we
have
been
helped
on
thoughtfully
observed
william
for
myself
i
am
not
sanguine
do
you
never
cherish
dreams
on
your
own
account
inquired
ashley
if
i
do
sir
they
are
vague
dreams
my
position
affords
no
scope
for
ambition
i
do
know
that
said
ashley
would
you
not
be
satisfied
to
become
one
of
the
great
manufacturers
of
this
great
city
he
continued
laughing
not
unless
i
could
be
one
of
the
greatest
such
as
william
stopped
myself
for
instance
quietly
put
in
ashley
yes
indeed
answered
william
lifting
his
earnest
eyes
to
his
master
were
it
possible
that
i
could
ever
attain
to
be
as
you
are
sir
in
all
things
in
character
in
position
in
the
estimation
of
my
it
would
be
sufficient
ambition
for
me
and
i
should
sit
down
content
not
you
cried
ashley
you
would
then
be
casting
your
thoughts
to
serving
your
said
in
parliament
or
some
such
exalted
vision
man
nature
is
to
soar
you
know
it
can
not
rest
as
soon
as
one
object
of
ambition
is
attained
others
are
sought
after
so
far
as
i
go
we
need
not
discuss
it
was
william
answer
no
chance
of
my
ever
becoming
even
a
manufacturer
let
alone
what
you
are
sir
the
next
best
thing
to
being
myself
would
perhaps
be
that
of
being
my
partner
william
the
voice
in
which
his
master
spoke
was
so
significant
that
face
flushed
to
crimson
ashley
noticed
it
did
that
ambition
ever
occur
to
you
no
sir
never
that
honour
is
looked
upon
as
being
destined
for
cyril
dare
indeed
calmly
repeated
ashley
if
you
could
transform
your
nature
into
cyril
i
do
not
say
but
that
it
might
be
so
in
time
he
expects
it
himself
sir
would
he
be
a
worthy
associate
for
me
think
you
inquired
ashley
bending
his
gaze
full
on
william
william
made
no
reply
perhaps
none
was
expected
for
his
master
resumed
i
do
not
recommend
you
to
indulge
that
particular
dream
of
ambition
i
can
not
see
sufficiently
into
the
future
it
is
my
intention
to
push
you
somewhat
on
in
the
world
i
have
no
son
to
advance
he
added
an
expression
of
sadness
crossing
his
face
all
i
can
do
for
my
boy
is
to
leave
him
at
ease
after
me
therefore
i
may
if
i
live
advance
you
in
his
stead
provided
william
you
continue
to
deserve
it
a
smile
parted
william
lips
that
he
would
ever
strive
for
heaven
helping
him
ashley
again
laid
his
hand
on
william
and
gazed
into
his
face
i
have
had
a
wonderful
account
of
you
from
samuel
lynn
and
it
is
not
often
the
friend
launches
into
decided
praise
oh
have
you
sir
returned
william
with
animation
i
am
glad
he
was
pleased
with
me
he
was
more
than
pleased
but
i
must
not
forget
that
i
was
charged
with
a
message
from
henry
he
is
outrageous
at
your
not
having
gone
to
him
last
night
i
shall
be
sending
him
to
france
one
of
these
days
under
your
escort
william
it
may
do
him
good
in
more
ways
than
one
i
will
come
to
henry
this
evening
sir
i
must
leave
him
though
for
half
an
hour
to
go
round
to
east
your
conscience
is
engaged
i
see
you
know
what
henry
accused
you
of
the
last
time
you
left
him
to
go
to
east
of
being
enamoured
of
charlotte
said
william
laughing
in
answer
to
ashley
smile
i
will
come
at
any
rate
sir
and
battle
the
other
matter
out
with
henry
chapter
a
bruised
heart
if
it
were
a
hopeless
task
to
attempt
to
describe
the
consternation
of
helstonleigh
at
the
death
of
anthony
dare
far
more
difficult
would
it
be
to
picture
that
of
anna
lynn
believe
herbert
guilty
anna
did
not
she
could
scarcely
have
believed
that
had
an
angel
come
down
from
heaven
to
affirm
it
her
state
of
mind
was
not
to
be
envied
suspense
sorrow
anxiety
filled
it
causing
her
to
be
in
a
grievous
state
of
restlessness
she
had
to
conceal
this
from
the
eyes
of
patience
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
for
one
thing
she
could
not
get
at
the
correct
particulars
newspapers
did
not
come
in
her
way
and
she
shrank
in
her
from
asking
her
whole
being
if
we
may
dare
to
say
it
here
was
wrapt
in
herbert
dare
father
friends
home
country
she
could
have
sacrificed
them
all
to
save
him
she
would
have
laid
down
her
life
for
his
her
good
sense
was
distorted
her
judgment
warped
she
saw
passing
events
not
with
the
eye
of
dispassionate
fact
or
with
any
fact
at
all
but
through
the
unhealthy
tinge
of
fond
blind
prejudice
the
blow
had
almost
crushed
her
the
dread
suspense
was
wearing
out
her
heart
she
seemed
no
longer
the
same
careless
child
as
before
in
a
few
hours
she
had
overstepped
the
barrier
of
girlish
timidity
and
had
gained
the
experience
which
is
bought
with
sorrow
on
the
evening
mentioned
in
the
last
chapter
just
before
william
went
out
to
keep
his
appointment
with
henry
ashley
he
saw
from
the
window
anna
in
his
mother
garden
bending
over
the
flowers
and
glancing
up
at
him
glancing
as
it
struck
william
with
a
strangely
wistful
expression
he
went
out
to
her
tending
the
flowers
anna
she
turned
to
him
her
fair
young
face
utterly
colourless
i
have
been
so
wanting
to
see
thee
william
i
came
here
hoping
thee
wouldst
come
out
at
dinner
time
i
was
here
and
thee
only
nodded
to
me
from
the
window
i
did
not
like
to
beckon
to
thee
i
am
sorry
to
have
been
so
stupid
anna
what
is
it
thee
hast
heard
what
has
happened
that
dreadful
thing
hast
thee
heard
it
all
i
believe
so
all
that
is
known
i
want
thee
to
tell
it
me
patience
wo
talk
of
it
hester
only
shakes
her
head
and
i
am
afraid
to
ask
gar
tell
it
to
me
it
would
not
do
you
good
to
know
anna
he
gravely
said
better
try
and
not
think
william
hush
thee
she
feverishly
exclaimed
thee
knew
there
was
a
a
friendship
between
me
and
if
i
can
not
learn
all
there
is
to
be
learnt
i
shall
die
william
looked
down
at
the
changing
cheek
the
eyes
full
of
pain
the
trembling
hands
clasped
in
their
eagerness
it
might
be
better
to
tell
her
than
to
leave
her
in
this
state
of
suspense
william
there
is
no
one
in
the
wide
world
that
knows
he
cared
for
me
but
thee
she
imploringly
resumed
thee
must
tell
me
thee
tell
me
you
mean
that
you
want
to
hear
the
particulars
of
of
what
took
place
on
thursday
night
yes
all
then
and
since
i
have
but
heard
snatches
of
the
wicked
tale
he
obeyed
her
telling
her
all
the
broad
facts
but
suppressing
a
few
of
the
details
she
leaned
against
the
listening
in
silence
her
face
turned
from
him
looking
through
the
bars
into
the
field
why
do
they
not
believe
him
was
her
first
comment
spoken
sharply
and
abruptly
he
says
he
was
not
near
the
house
at
the
time
the
act
must
have
been
done
why
do
they
not
believe
him
it
is
easy
to
assert
a
thing
anna
but
the
law
requires
proof
proof
that
he
must
declare
to
them
where
he
has
been
undoubtedly
and
corroborative
proof
must
also
be
given
but
what
sort
of
proof
i
do
not
understand
their
laws
suppose
herbert
dare
asserted
that
he
had
spent
those
hours
with
me
for
instance
then
i
must
go
forward
at
the
trial
and
confirm
his
assertion
also
any
other
witnesses
who
may
have
seen
him
with
me
if
there
were
any
it
would
be
establishing
what
is
called
an
and
would
they
acquit
him
then
suppose
there
were
only
one
witness
to
speak
for
him
would
one
be
sufficient
certainly
provided
the
witness
were
trustworthy
if
a
witness
went
forward
and
declared
it
now
would
they
release
him
impossible
he
is
committed
to
take
his
trial
at
the
assizes
and
he
can
not
be
released
beforehand
it
is
exceedingly
unwise
of
him
not
to
declare
where
he
was
that
evening
if
he
can
do
so
where
do
the
public
think
he
was
what
do
they
say
i
am
afraid
the
public
anna
think
that
he
was
not
out
anywhere
at
any
rate
after
eleven
or
then
they
are
very
cruel
she
passionately
exclaimed
do
they
think
that
there
may
be
a
few
who
judge
that
it
was
as
he
says
that
he
was
really
away
and
is
consequently
innocent
and
where
do
think
he
was
eagerly
responded
anna
again
do
they
suspect
any
place
where
he
might
have
been
william
made
no
reply
it
was
not
at
all
expedient
to
impart
to
her
all
the
gossip
or
surmises
of
the
town
but
his
silence
seemed
to
agitate
her
more
than
any
reply
could
have
done
she
turned
to
him
trembling
with
emotion
the
tears
streaming
down
her
face
oh
william
tell
me
what
is
thought
tell
me
i
implore
thee
thee
can
not
leave
me
in
this
trouble
where
is
it
thought
he
was
he
took
her
hands
he
bent
over
her
as
tenderly
as
any
brother
could
have
done
he
read
all
too
surely
how
opposite
to
the
truth
had
been
her
former
assertion
to
him
that
she
did
not
care
for
herbert
dare
anna
child
you
must
not
agitate
yourself
in
this
way
there
is
no
just
cause
for
doing
so
i
assure
you
i
do
not
know
where
it
is
thought
herbert
dare
may
have
been
that
night
neither
so
far
as
can
be
learnt
does
any
one
else
know
it
is
the
chief
point
where
he
was
that
is
puzzling
the
town
she
laid
her
head
down
on
the
gate
again
closing
her
eyes
as
in
very
weariness
william
heart
ached
for
her
he
may
not
be
guilty
anna
was
all
the
consolation
he
could
find
to
offer
not
be
guilty
she
echoed
in
a
tone
of
pain
he
not
guilty
william
i
tell
thee
he
is
not
dost
thee
think
i
would
defend
him
if
he
could
do
so
wicked
a
thing
he
did
not
dispute
the
point
with
her
he
did
not
tell
her
that
her
assumption
of
his
innocence
was
inconsistent
with
the
facts
of
the
case
presently
anna
resumed
why
must
he
remain
in
gaol
till
the
trial
there
was
that
man
who
stole
the
skins
from
thomas
ashley
they
let
him
out
when
he
was
taken
until
the
sessions
came
on
and
then
he
went
up
for
trial
that
man
was
out
on
bail
but
they
do
not
take
bail
in
cases
so
grave
as
this
i
may
not
stay
longer
there
hester
coming
to
call
me
in
i
rely
upon
thee
to
tell
me
anything
fresh
that
may
arise
she
said
lifting
her
beseeching
eyes
to
his
one
word
anna
before
you
go
and
yet
i
see
how
worse
than
useless
it
is
to
say
it
to
you
now
you
must
forget
herbert
dare
i
shall
forget
him
william
when
i
cease
to
have
memory
she
whispered
never
before
thee
wilt
keep
my
counsel
truly
and
faithfully
fare
thee
well
william
i
have
no
friend
but
thee
she
ran
swiftly
into
their
own
premises
william
turned
to
pursue
his
way
to
ashley
the
thought
of
henry
ashley
misplaced
attachment
lying
on
his
mind
as
an
incubus
chapter
vi
one
dying
in
honey
fair
buffle
stood
in
what
she
called
her
practically
superintending
a
periodical
wash
the
day
was
hot
and
the
steam
was
hot
and
as
buffle
rubbed
away
she
began
to
think
she
should
never
be
cool
again
missis
shrieked
out
a
young
voice
from
the
precincts
of
the
shop
ben
tyrrett
wife
says
will
you
let
her
have
a
gill
o
vinegar
be
i
to
serve
it
the
words
came
from
the
small
damsel
who
was
had
in
to
help
on
cleaning
and
washing
days
buffle
kept
her
hands
still
in
the
soapsuds
and
projected
her
hot
face
over
the
tub
to
answer
matty
tell
mary
ann
tyrrett
as
she
promised
faithful
to
bring
me
something
off
her
score
this
week
but
i
not
seen
the
colour
of
it
yet
she
says
as
it
to
put
to
his
head
called
back
matty
alluding
to
the
present
demand
he
bad
and
have
fainted
right
off
serve
him
right
responded
buffle
you
may
give
her
the
vinegar
matty
tell
her
as
it
a
penny
farthing
i
heered
he
had
been
drinking
again
she
added
to
herself
and
the
washing
tub
and
laid
hisself
down
in
the
wet
road
the
night
afore
last
and
was
found
there
in
the
morning
later
in
the
day
it
happened
that
william
halliburton
was
passing
through
honey
fair
and
met
charlotte
east
she
stopped
him
have
you
heard
sir
that
tyrrett
is
dying
she
asked
tyrrett
dying
repeated
william
in
amazement
who
says
he
is
the
doctor
says
it
i
believe
sir
i
must
say
he
looks
like
it
mary
ann
sent
for
me
and
i
have
been
down
to
see
him
why
what
can
be
the
matter
with
him
asked
william
he
was
at
work
the
day
before
yesterday
he
was
at
work
sir
but
he
could
not
speak
they
tell
me
for
that
illness
that
has
been
hanging
about
him
so
long
and
had
settled
on
his
chest
that
night
after
leaving
work
instead
of
going
home
and
getting
a
basin
of
gruel
or
something
of
that
sort
he
went
to
the
horned
ram
and
drank
there
till
he
could
keep
upright
with
his
chest
in
that
state
and
that
was
not
the
worst
resumed
charlotte
it
had
been
a
wet
day
if
you
remember
sir
and
he
somehow
strayed
into
oxlip
lane
and
fell
down
and
lay
there
till
morning
what
with
drink
and
what
with
exposure
to
the
wet
his
chest
grew
dangerously
inflamed
and
now
the
doctor
says
he
has
not
many
hours
to
live
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
cried
william
is
he
sensible
too
sensible
sir
in
one
sense
replied
charlotte
his
remorse
is
dreadful
he
is
saying
that
if
he
had
not
misspent
his
life
he
might
have
died
a
good
man
instead
of
a
bad
one
william
passed
on
much
concerned
at
the
news
his
way
led
him
past
ben
tyrrett
lodgings
and
he
turned
in
mary
ann
was
sobbing
and
wailing
in
the
midst
of
as
many
curious
and
condoling
neighbours
as
the
kitchen
would
contain
all
were
in
full
gossip
as
might
be
expected
cross
had
taken
home
the
three
little
children
by
way
of
keeping
the
place
quiet
and
the
sick
man
was
lying
in
the
room
above
surrounded
by
several
of
his
who
had
heard
of
his
critical
state
some
of
the
women
sidled
off
when
william
entered
rather
ashamed
of
being
caught
chattering
vehemently
it
was
remarkable
the
deference
that
was
paid
him
and
from
no
assumption
of
his
own
indeed
the
absence
of
assumption
may
have
partially
accounted
for
it
but
though
ever
courteous
and
pleasant
with
them
all
he
was
a
thorough
gentleman
and
the
working
classes
are
keen
to
distinguish
this
why
tyrrett
this
is
sad
news
he
said
is
your
husband
so
ill
oh
he
must
die
he
must
die
sir
she
answered
in
a
frantic
tone
uncomfortably
as
they
had
lived
together
the
man
was
still
her
husband
and
there
is
no
doubt
she
was
feeling
the
present
crisis
was
shrinking
with
dread
from
the
future
a
widow
with
three
young
children
and
the
workhouse
for
an
asylum
it
was
the
only
prospect
before
her
he
must
die
anyways
but
he
might
have
lasted
a
few
hours
longer
if
i
could
have
got
what
the
doctor
ordered
william
did
not
understand
it
was
a
blister
and
some
physic
sir
explained
one
of
the
women
the
doctor
wrote
it
on
a
paper
and
said
it
was
to
be
took
to
the
nearest
druggist
but
when
they
got
it
there
darwin
said
he
trust
the
tyrretts
and
they
must
send
the
money
if
they
wanted
the
things
it
was
not
parry
then
who
was
called
in
it
were
a
strange
doctor
sir
as
was
fetched
there
was
tyrrett
last
bout
of
illness
owing
for
to
parry
and
so
they
did
like
to
send
for
him
as
to
them
druggists
they
be
some
of
a
set
unless
you
goes
with
the
money
in
your
hand
william
asked
to
see
the
prescription
it
was
produced
and
he
read
its
contents
he
was
as
capable
of
doing
so
and
of
understanding
it
as
the
best
doctor
in
helstonleigh
he
tore
a
leaf
from
his
wrote
a
few
words
in
pencil
folded
it
with
the
prescription
and
desired
one
of
the
women
to
take
it
to
the
chemist
again
he
then
went
up
to
the
sick
room
tyrrett
was
lying
on
a
flock
mattress
on
an
ugly
brown
bedstead
the
four
posts
upright
and
undraped
a
blanket
and
a
checked
blue
cotton
quilt
covered
him
his
breathing
was
terribly
laboured
his
face
painfully
anxious
william
approached
him
bending
his
head
to
avoid
contact
with
the
ceiling
i
sir
cried
the
man
in
tones
as
anxious
as
his
face
at
last
i
hope
not
said
william
i
hope
you
will
get
better
you
are
to
have
a
blister
on
your
chest
and
no
he
ai
sir
interrupted
one
of
the
men
darwin
wo
send
it
oh
yes
he
will
if
he
is
properly
asked
they
have
gone
again
to
him
are
you
in
much
pain
tyrrett
i
in
an
agony
of
pain
here
sir
pointing
to
his
chest
but
that
ai
nothing
to
my
pain
of
mind
oh
halliburton
you
good
sir
you
have
nothing
to
reproach
yourself
with
ca
you
do
nothing
for
me
i
going
into
the
sight
of
my
maker
and
he
angry
with
me
in
truth
william
knew
not
what
to
answer
tyrrett
voice
was
as
a
wail
of
anguish
his
hands
were
stretched
out
beseechingly
charlotte
east
were
here
just
now
and
she
told
me
to
go
to
christ
that
he
was
merciful
and
forgiving
but
how
am
i
to
go
to
him
if
i
try
sir
i
ca
for
there
my
past
life
rising
up
before
me
i
have
been
a
bad
man
i
have
never
once
in
all
my
life
tried
to
please
god
the
words
echoed
through
the
stillness
of
the
room
echoed
with
a
sound
that
was
terribly
awful
once
to
have
tried
to
please
god
throughout
a
whole
life
and
throughout
all
its
blessings
i
have
never
thought
of
god
he
continued
to
reiterate
i
have
never
cared
for
him
or
tried
to
please
him
or
done
the
least
thing
for
him
and
now
i
going
to
face
his
wrath
and
i
ca
help
myself
you
may
be
spared
yet
said
william
you
may
indeed
and
your
future
life
must
atone
for
the
past
i
sha
be
spared
sir
i
feel
that
the
world
all
up
with
me
was
the
rejoinder
i
going
fast
and
there
nobody
to
give
me
a
word
of
comfort
ca
sir
i
going
away
and
god
angry
with
me
william
leaned
over
him
i
can
only
say
as
charlotte
east
did
he
whispered
try
and
find
your
saviour
there
is
mercy
with
him
at
the
eleventh
hour
i
have
not
the
time
to
find
him
breathed
forth
tyrrett
in
agony
i
might
find
him
if
i
had
time
given
me
but
i
have
not
got
it
william
shrinking
in
his
youth
and
inexperience
from
arguing
upon
topics
so
momentous
was
not
equal
to
the
emergency
who
was
he
did
what
he
could
and
that
was
to
despatch
a
message
for
a
clergyman
who
answered
the
summons
with
speed
the
blister
also
came
and
the
medicine
that
had
been
prescribed
william
went
home
hoping
all
might
prove
as
a
healing
balm
to
the
sick
man
a
fallacious
hope
tyrrett
died
the
following
morning
when
william
went
round
early
on
his
mission
of
inquiry
he
found
him
dead
some
of
the
men
whom
he
had
seen
with
tyrrett
the
previous
night
were
assembled
in
the
kitchen
he
is
but
just
gone
sir
they
said
the
women
be
up
with
him
now
they
have
took
his
wife
round
screeching
to
her
mother
he
died
with
that
there
blister
on
his
chest
did
he
die
peacefully
was
william
question
awful
hard
sir
toward
the
last
moaning
and
calling
and
clenching
his
hands
in
mortal
pain
his
sister
she
come
round
she
a
hard
one
is
that
liza
tyrrett
and
she
set
on
at
the
wife
saying
it
was
her
fault
that
he
took
to
go
out
drinking
that
there
parson
could
do
nothing
with
him
concluded
the
speaker
lowering
his
voice
william
breath
stood
still
no
the
man
shook
his
head
tyrrett
were
in
a
frame
o
mind
for
it
sir
he
kep
crying
out
as
he
had
led
a
bad
life
and
never
thought
of
god
and
them
was
his
last
words
it
ai
happy
sir
to
die
like
that
it
have
quite
cowed
down
us
as
was
with
him
one
gets
thinking
sir
what
sort
of
a
place
it
may
be
side
where
he
gone
to
william
lifted
his
head
a
sort
of
eager
hope
on
his
countenance
speaking
cheerily
could
you
not
let
poor
tyrrett
death
act
as
a
warning
to
you
there
was
a
dead
silence
five
men
were
present
every
one
of
them
leading
careless
lives
somehow
they
did
not
much
like
to
hear
of
warning
although
the
present
moment
was
one
of
unusual
seriousness
religion
is
so
dreadful
dull
and
gloomy
sir
religion
dull
and
gloomy
echoed
william
well
perhaps
some
people
do
make
a
gloomy
affair
of
it
but
then
i
do
think
theirs
can
be
the
right
religion
i
do
not
believe
people
were
sent
into
the
world
to
be
gloomy
time
enough
for
that
when
troubles
come
what
religion
asked
one
of
the
men
it
is
a
sort
of
thing
that
a
great
deal
better
to
be
felt
than
talked
about
answered
william
i
am
no
parson
and
can
not
pretend
to
enlighten
you
we
might
never
come
to
an
understanding
over
it
were
we
to
discuss
it
all
day
long
i
would
rather
talk
to
you
of
life
and
its
practical
duties
tyrrett
said
as
he
had
never
paid
heed
to
any
of
his
duties
it
were
his
cry
over
and
over
again
sir
in
the
night
he
said
he
had
drunk
and
swore
and
beat
his
wife
and
done
just
what
he
ought
to
done
ay
i
fear
it
was
so
replied
william
poor
tyrrett
existence
was
divided
into
three
phrases
working
drinking
quarrelling
dissatisfaction
attending
all
i
fear
a
great
many
more
in
honey
fair
could
say
the
same
the
men
consciences
were
pricking
them
some
of
them
began
to
stand
uncomfortably
on
one
leg
tippled
quarrelled
they
been
known
to
administer
personal
correction
to
their
wives
on
provocation
times
upon
times
i
asked
tyrrett
to
come
round
of
an
evening
to
robert
east
continued
william
he
never
did
come
but
i
can
tell
you
this
my
men
had
he
taken
to
pass
his
evenings
there
twelve
months
ago
when
the
society
as
they
call
it
was
first
formed
he
might
have
been
a
hale
man
now
instead
of
lying
there
dead
do
you
mean
that
he
have
growed
religious
sir
i
tell
you
we
will
put
religion
out
of
the
discussion
as
you
seem
to
like
the
word
had
tyrrett
taken
to
like
rational
evenings
instead
of
it
would
have
made
a
wonderful
difference
in
his
mode
of
thought
and
difference
in
conduct
would
have
followed
look
at
his
cross
he
was
living
without
hope
or
aim
at
loggerheads
with
his
wife
and
with
the
world
and
rather
given
to
wishing
himself
dead
all
that
over
do
you
think
i
should
like
to
go
about
with
a
dirty
face
and
holes
in
my
coat
the
men
laughed
they
thought
not
cross
used
to
do
so
but
you
see
nothing
of
that
now
many
others
used
to
do
so
many
do
so
still
rather
again
the
men
tried
to
hide
their
elbows
it
true
enough
said
one
cross
and
some
more
of
are
getting
smart
smart
inside
as
well
as
out
said
william
they
are
acquiring
one
of
the
best
qualities
a
man
can
find
they
would
be
seen
in
the
street
now
in
rags
or
the
worse
for
drink
or
in
any
other
degrading
position
no
not
if
you
bribed
them
with
gold
coming
round
to
east
has
done
that
for
them
they
are
beginning
to
see
that
just
as
well
to
lead
pleasant
lives
here
as
unpleasant
ones
in
a
short
time
cross
will
be
getting
furniture
about
him
again
towards
setting
up
the
home
he
lost
he
and
many
more
will
also
as
i
truly
believe
be
beginning
to
set
up
furniture
of
another
sort
what
sort
that
sir
the
furniture
that
will
stand
him
in
need
for
the
next
life
the
life
that
tyrrett
has
now
entered
upon
replied
william
in
deeper
tones
it
is
a
life
that
come
you
know
our
little
span
of
time
here
in
comparison
with
eternity
is
but
as
a
drop
of
water
to
the
great
river
that
runs
through
the
town
and
it
is
as
well
to
be
prepared
for
it
now
the
next
five
i
am
going
to
get
round
to
east
are
you
us
sir
every
one
of
you
although
i
believe
you
have
been
in
the
habit
of
complimenting
your
friends
who
go
there
with
the
title
of
i
want
to
take
you
there
this
evening
if
you
do
like
it
you
know
you
need
not
repeat
the
visit
you
will
come
to
oblige
me
wo
you
they
said
they
would
and
william
went
out
satisfied
though
he
hardly
knew
how
robert
east
would
manage
to
stow
away
the
new
comers
not
many
steps
from
the
door
he
encountered
buffle
she
stopped
him
to
talk
of
tyrrett
better
that
he
had
spent
his
loose
time
at
east
than
at
the
publics
remarked
that
lady
it
is
the
very
thing
we
have
been
saying
answered
william
i
wish
we
could
get
all
honey
fair
there
though
indeed
there
no
room
for
more
than
we
have
now
i
cast
a
longing
eye
sometimes
to
that
building
at
the
back
which
they
say
was
built
for
a
mormon
stronghold
and
has
never
been
fitted
up
owing
to
a
dispute
among
themselves
about
the
number
of
wives
each
elder
might
appropriate
to
his
own
share
disgraceful
pollagists
struck
in
buffle
apostrophizing
the
mormon
elders
one
husband
is
enough
to
have
at
one
fireside
goodness
knows
without
being
worried
with
an
unlimited
number
that
is
not
the
question
said
william
laughing
it
is
how
many
wives
are
enough
however
i
wish
we
could
get
the
building
east
will
have
to
hold
the
gathering
in
his
garden
soon
there
no
denying
that
it
have
worked
good
in
honey
fair
acknowledged
buffle
it
is
alone
the
men
that
have
grown
more
respectable
them
as
have
took
to
go
but
their
wives
too
you
see
sir
in
sitting
at
the
it
was
only
that
they
drank
themselves
quarrelsome
but
they
spent
their
money
now
their
tempers
are
saved
and
their
money
saved
the
wives
see
the
benefit
of
it
and
of
course
try
to
be
theirselves
not
but
what
plenty
of
room
for
improvement
still
added
buffle
in
a
tone
of
patronage
it
will
come
in
time
said
william
what
we
must
do
now
is
to
look
out
for
a
larger
room
one
with
a
chimbley
in
it
as
draw
suggested
buffle
oh
yes
what
would
they
do
without
fire
on
a
winter
night
the
great
point
is
to
have
things
thoroughly
comfortable
if
it
had
been
for
the
chimbley
i
might
have
offered
our
big
garret
sir
but
it
the
crankiest
thing
ever
built
is
that
chimbley
the
minute
a
handful
of
fire
lighted
the
smoke
puffs
it
out
again
and
then
again
there
be
the
passing
through
the
shop
obstructing
the
custom
of
course
there
would
assented
william
we
must
try
for
that
failure
in
the
rear
after
all
chapter
vii
coming
home
to
the
dares
the
pyramids
of
egypt
grew
in
the
course
of
time
into
pyramids
as
was
oracularly
remarked
by
sergeant
delves
but
that
official
exertions
labour
as
hard
as
he
would
grew
to
nothing
when
applied
to
the
cause
with
which
he
had
compared
the
pyramids
all
inquiry
all
searching
brought
to
bear
upon
it
by
him
and
his
did
not
bring
anything
to
light
of
herbert
dare
movements
on
that
fatal
night
where
he
had
passed
the
hours
remained
an
impenetrable
mystery
and
the
sergeant
had
to
confess
himself
foiled
he
came
not
unnaturally
to
the
conclusion
that
herbert
dare
was
not
anywhere
so
far
as
the
outer
world
was
concerned
that
he
had
been
at
home
committing
the
mischief
a
conclusion
the
sergeant
had
drawn
from
the
very
first
and
it
had
never
been
shaken
nevertheless
it
was
his
duty
to
put
all
the
skill
and
craft
of
the
local
police
force
into
action
and
very
close
inquiries
were
made
every
house
of
entertainment
in
the
city
of
whatever
nature
whether
a
or
an
whether
a
chief
hotel
or
an
obscure
was
visited
and
keenly
questioned
but
no
one
would
acknowledge
to
having
seen
herbert
dare
on
the
particular
evening
in
short
no
trace
of
him
could
be
unearthed
just
as
much
out
as
i
was
said
the
sergeant
to
himself
and
helstonleigh
held
the
same
conviction
pomeranian
knoll
was
desolate
with
a
desolation
it
had
never
expected
to
fall
upon
it
a
shattering
blow
had
been
struck
to
and
dare
to
lose
their
eldest
son
in
so
terrible
a
manner
seemed
of
itself
sufficient
agony
for
a
whole
lifetime
whatever
may
have
been
his
faults
and
helstonleigh
knew
that
he
was
somewhat
rich
in
faults
he
was
dear
to
them
dearer
than
her
other
children
to
dare
herbert
had
remarked
in
conversing
with
anna
lynn
that
anthony
was
his
mother
favourite
it
was
so
she
had
loved
him
deeply
had
been
blind
to
his
failings
neither
dare
nor
his
wife
was
amongst
the
religious
of
the
world
religious
thoughts
and
reflections
they
in
common
with
many
others
in
helstonleigh
were
content
to
leave
to
a
remote
but
they
had
been
less
than
human
worse
than
heathen
could
they
be
insensible
to
the
fate
of
anthony
hurled
away
with
his
sins
upon
his
head
he
was
cut
off
suddenly
from
this
world
and
what
of
the
next
it
was
a
question
an
uncertainty
that
they
dared
not
follow
and
they
sat
one
on
each
side
their
desolate
hearth
and
wailed
forth
their
vain
anguish
this
would
in
truth
have
been
tribulation
enough
to
have
overshadowed
a
life
but
there
was
more
beyond
it
hemmed
in
by
pride
as
the
dares
had
been
playing
at
being
great
and
grand
in
helstonleigh
the
situation
of
herbert
setting
aside
their
fears
or
their
sympathy
for
himself
was
about
the
most
complete
checkmate
that
could
have
fallen
upon
them
it
was
the
cup
of
humiliation
drained
to
its
dregs
whether
he
should
be
proved
guilty
or
not
he
was
thrown
into
prison
as
a
common
felon
awaiting
his
trial
for
murder
and
that
disgrace
could
not
be
wiped
out
did
they
believe
him
guilty
they
did
not
know
themselves
to
suspect
him
of
such
a
crime
was
painful
in
the
last
degree
to
their
feelings
but
why
did
he
persist
in
refusing
to
state
where
he
was
on
the
eventful
night
there
was
the
point
that
staggered
them
a
deep
gloom
overhung
the
house
extending
to
all
its
inmates
even
the
servants
went
about
with
sad
faces
and
quiet
steps
the
young
ladies
knew
that
a
calamity
had
been
dealt
to
them
from
which
they
should
never
wholly
recover
their
star
of
brilliancy
in
its
little
sphere
of
light
at
helstonleigh
had
faded
into
dimness
if
not
wholly
gone
down
below
the
horizon
should
herbert
be
found
guilty
it
could
never
rise
again
adelaide
rarely
spoke
she
appeared
to
possess
some
inward
source
of
vexation
or
grief
apart
from
the
general
tribulation
at
least
so
judged
signora
varsini
and
she
was
a
shrewd
observer
she
miss
dare
spent
most
of
her
time
shut
up
in
her
own
room
rosa
and
minny
were
chiefly
with
their
governess
they
were
getting
of
an
age
to
feel
it
in
an
equal
degree
with
the
rest
rosa
was
eighteen
and
had
begun
to
go
out
with
dare
and
adelaide
minny
was
anticipating
the
same
privilege
it
was
all
stopped
now
visiting
gaiety
pleasure
and
it
was
felt
as
a
part
of
the
misfortune
the
first
shock
of
the
occurrence
subsided
the
funeral
over
and
the
family
settled
down
in
its
mourning
the
governess
exacted
their
studies
from
her
two
pupils
as
before
they
were
loth
to
recommence
them
and
appealed
to
their
mother
it
was
cruel
of
mademoiselle
to
wish
it
of
them
they
said
mademoiselle
rejoined
that
her
motive
was
anything
but
cruel
she
felt
sure
that
occupation
for
the
mind
was
the
best
counteraction
to
grief
if
they
would
not
study
where
was
the
use
of
her
remaining
she
demanded
madame
dare
had
better
allow
her
to
leave
she
would
go
without
notice
if
madame
pleased
she
should
be
glad
to
get
back
to
the
continent
they
did
not
have
murders
there
in
society
at
least
she
mademoiselle
had
never
encountered
personal
experience
of
it
dare
did
not
appear
willing
to
accede
to
the
proposition
the
governess
was
a
most
efficient
instructress
and
six
or
twelve
months
more
of
her
services
would
be
essential
to
her
pupils
if
they
were
to
be
turned
out
as
pupils
ought
to
be
besides
sergeant
delves
had
intimated
that
the
signora
testimony
would
be
necessary
at
the
trial
and
therefore
she
could
not
be
allowed
to
depart
dare
thought
if
they
did
allow
her
to
depart
they
might
be
accused
of
wishing
to
suppress
evidence
and
it
might
tell
against
herbert
so
mademoiselle
had
to
resign
herself
to
remaining
très
bien
she
equably
said
she
was
willing
only
the
young
ladies
must
resume
their
lessons
a
mandate
in
which
dare
acquiesced
sometimes
minny
who
was
given
to
be
incorrigibly
idle
would
burst
into
tears
over
the
trouble
of
her
work
and
then
lay
it
upon
her
distress
touching
the
uncertain
fate
of
herbert
one
day
upon
doing
this
the
governess
broke
out
sharply
he
deserves
to
lie
in
prison
does
monsieur
herbert
why
do
you
say
that
mademoiselle
asked
minny
resentfully
because
he
is
a
fool
politely
returned
mademoiselle
he
say
does
he
not
that
he
was
not
home
at
the
time
it
is
well
but
why
does
he
not
say
where
he
was
i
think
he
is
a
fool
me
you
may
as
well
say
outright
mademoiselle
that
you
think
him
guilty
retorted
minny
but
i
not
think
him
guilty
dissented
mademoiselle
i
have
said
from
the
first
that
he
was
not
guilty
i
think
he
is
not
one
capable
of
doing
such
an
injury
to
his
brother
or
to
any
one
else
i
used
to
be
great
friends
with
monsieur
herbert
once
when
i
gave
him
those
italian
lessons
and
i
never
saw
to
make
me
believe
his
disposition
was
a
cruel
in
point
of
fact
the
governess
more
explicitly
than
any
one
else
in
the
house
had
unceasingly
declared
her
belief
in
herbert
innocence
truly
and
sincerely
she
did
not
believe
him
capable
of
so
grievous
a
crime
he
was
not
of
a
cruel
or
revengeful
disposition
certainly
not
one
to
lie
in
wait
and
attack
another
savagely
and
secretly
she
had
never
believed
that
he
was
and
would
not
believe
it
now
neither
had
his
family
sergeant
delves
opinion
was
that
whoever
had
attacked
anthony
lain
in
wait
for
him
in
the
dining
room
and
had
sprung
upon
him
as
he
entered
it
is
possible
however
that
the
same
point
staggered
mademoiselle
that
staggered
the
rest
herbert
dare
refusal
to
state
where
he
was
at
the
time
believing
as
she
did
that
he
could
account
for
it
if
he
chose
she
deemed
herself
perfectly
justified
in
applying
to
him
the
complimentary
epithet
you
have
just
heard
she
expressed
true
sympathy
and
regret
at
the
untimely
fate
of
anthony
lamenting
him
much
and
genuinely
upon
cyril
and
george
the
punishment
also
fell
with
one
brother
not
cold
in
his
grave
and
the
other
thrown
into
gaol
to
await
his
trial
for
murder
they
could
not
for
shame
pursue
their
amusements
as
formerly
and
amusements
to
cyril
and
george
dare
had
become
a
necessity
of
daily
life
their
friends
and
companions
were
growing
shy
of
them
or
they
fancied
it
conscience
is
all
too
suggestive
they
fancied
people
shunned
them
when
they
walked
along
the
street
cyril
even
as
he
stood
in
samuel
lynn
room
at
the
manufactory
thought
the
men
as
they
passed
in
and
out
looked
askance
at
him
very
likely
it
was
only
imagination
george
dare
had
set
his
heart
upon
a
commission
one
of
the
members
for
the
city
had
made
a
to
dare
that
he
would
see
what
could
be
done
at
the
horse
guards
failing
available
interest
in
that
quarter
george
was
in
hope
that
his
father
would
screw
out
money
to
purchase
one
but
until
herbert
was
proved
innocent
if
that
time
should
ever
arrive
the
question
of
his
entering
the
army
must
remain
in
abeyance
this
state
of
things
altogether
did
not
give
pleasure
to
cyril
and
george
dare
but
there
was
no
remedy
for
it
and
they
had
to
content
themselves
with
sundry
private
explosions
of
temper
by
way
of
relief
to
their
minds
yes
the
evil
fell
upon
all
upon
the
parents
and
upon
the
children
of
course
the
latter
suffered
nothing
in
comparison
with
and
dare
unhappy
days
restless
nights
were
their
portion
now
the
world
seemed
to
be
growing
too
miserable
to
live
in
there
must
be
a
fatality
upon
the
boys
dare
exclaimed
one
day
in
the
bitterness
of
his
spirit
as
he
paced
the
room
with
restless
steps
his
wife
sitting
moodily
her
elbow
on
the
her
cheek
pressed
upon
her
hand
unless
there
had
been
a
fatality
upon
them
they
never
could
have
turned
out
as
they
have
dare
resented
the
speech
in
her
unhappy
frame
of
mind
which
told
terribly
upon
her
temper
it
seemed
a
sort
of
relief
to
resent
everything
if
dare
spoke
against
their
sons
she
stood
up
for
them
turned
out
she
repeated
angrily
let
us
say
as
things
have
turned
out
then
if
you
will
they
appear
to
be
turning
out
pretty
badly
as
it
seems
to
me
the
boys
have
had
every
indulgence
in
life
they
have
enjoyed
a
luxurious
home
they
have
ruined
me
to
supply
their
extravagances
ruined
you
again
resented
dare
ay
ruined
it
has
all
but
come
to
it
and
yet
what
good
has
the
indulgence
or
have
the
advantages
brought
them
far
better
i
begin
to
see
it
now
that
they
had
been
reared
to
made
to
work
for
their
daily
bread
how
can
you
give
utterance
to
such
things
rejoined
dare
in
a
chafed
tone
dare
stopped
in
his
restless
pacing
and
confronted
his
wife
are
we
happy
in
our
sons
speak
the
truth
how
could
any
one
be
happy
overwhelmed
with
a
misfortune
such
as
this
put
that
aside
what
are
they
without
it
rebellious
to
us
badly
conducted
in
the
sight
of
the
world
who
says
they
are
badly
conducted
asked
dare
an
undercurrent
of
consciousness
whispering
that
she
need
not
have
made
the
objection
they
may
be
a
little
wild
but
it
is
a
common
failing
with
those
of
their
age
and
condition
their
faults
are
only
faults
of
youth
and

continued
resuming
his
walk
but
there
must
have
been
something
radically
wrong
in
their
anthony

herbert
perhaps
to
follow
him
by
almost
a
worse
death
certainly
a
more
disgraceful
one
cyril
dare
stopped
abruptly
in
his
catalogue
and
went
on
more
generally
there
is
no
comfort
in
them
for
us
there
never
will
be
any
what
can
you
bring
against
cyril
sharply
asked
dare
it
may
be
that
these
complaints
of
her
husband
fretted
her
temper
chafed
perhaps
her
conscience
certain
it
was
they
rendered
her
irritable
and
dare
had
latterly
indulged
in
them
frequently
if
cyril
is
a
little
wild
it
is
a
gentlemanly
failing
there
nothing
else
to
urge
against
him
is
theft
gentlemanly
theft
repeated
dare
theft
i
have
concealed
many
things
from
you
julia
wishing
to
spare
your
feelings
but
it
may
be
as
well
now
that
you
should
know
a
little
more
of
what
your
sons
really
are
cyril
might
have
stood
where
herbert
will
stand
at
the
criminal
bar
though
for
a
crime
of
lesser
degree
for
all
i
can
tell
he
may
stand
at
it
still
dare
looked
scared
what
has
he
done
she
asked
her
tone
growing
timid
i
say
that
i
have
kept
these
things
from
you
i
wish
i
could
have
kept
them
from
you
always
but
it
seems
to
me
that
exposure
is
arising
in
many
ways
and
it
is
better
that
you
should
be
prepared
for
it
if
it
must
come
i
awake
now
in
the
morning
to
apprehension
i
am
alarmed
throughout
the
day
at
my
own
shadow
dreading
what
unknown
fate
may
not
be
falling
upon
them
herbert
in
peril
of
the
hangman
cyril
in
peril
of
a
forced
voyage
to
the
penal
settlements
a
sensation
of
utter
fear
stole
over
dare
for
the
moment
she
could
not
speak
but
she
rallied
her
powers
to
defend
cyril
i
think
cyril
is
hardly
used
what
with
one
thing
and
another
he
was
to
have
gone
on
that
french
journey
and
at
the
last
moment
was
pushed
out
of
it
for
halliburton
i
felt
more
vexed
at
it
almost
than
cyril
himself
and
i
spoke
a
word
of
my
mind
to
mrs
ashley
you
did
yes
i
did
not
speak
of
it
in
the
light
of
disappointment
to
cyril
the
actual
fact
of
not
taking
the
journey
so
much
as
of
the
vexation
he
experienced
at
being
supplanted
by
one
whom
he
whom
we
all
consider
inferior
to
himself
william
halliburton
i
let
ashley
know
that
we
regarded
it
as
a
most
unmerited
and
slight
and
i
took
care
to
drop
a
hint
that
we
believed
halliburton
to
have
been
guilty
in
that
cheque
affair
dare
paused
what
did
ashley
say
he
presently
asked
she
said
very
little
i
never
saw
her
so
frigid
she
intimated
that
ashley
was
a
competent
judge
of
his
own
business
i
mean
as
to
the
cheque
interrupted
dare
she
was
more
frigid
over
that
than
over
the
other
she
preferred
not
to
discuss
it
she
answered
who
might
have
stolen
it
or
who
not
i
can
set
you
right
on
both
points
said
dare
cyril
came
to
me
complaining
of
being
superseded
in
this
french
journey
and
i
complied
with
his
request
that
i
should
go
and
remonstrate
with
ashley
being
a
simpleton
for
my
pains
ashley
informed
me
that
he
never
had
entertained
the
slightest
intention
of
despatching
cyril
and
why
cyril
should
have
taken
up
the
notion
he
could
not
tell
ashley
went
on
to
say
that
he
did
not
consider
cyril
sufficiently
steady
to
be
intrusted
abroad
alone
steady
echoed
dare
what
has
steadiness
to
do
with
executing
business
and
as
to
being
alone
quaker
lynn
went
over
also
but
at
the
outset
which
was
the
time
i
spoke
to
him
intention
was
to
dispatch
only
one
halliburton
he
said
that
want
of
steadiness
would
always
have
been
a
bar
to
his
thinking
of
him
shall
i
go
on
and
enlighten
you
on
the
other
point
the
cheque
dare
added
after
a
pause
y
es
she
answered
a
nervous
dread
causing
her
to
speak
with
hesitation
had
she
a
foreshadowing
of
what
was
coming
it
was
cyril
who
took
it
said
dare
dropping
his
voice
to
a
whisper
cyril
she
gasped
our
son
cyril
no
other
dare
took
her
hand
from
her
cheek
and
leaned
back
in
the
chair
she
was
very
pale
he
was
traced
to
white
shop
where
he
changed
the
cheque
for
gold
he
had
put
on
herbert
cloak
the
plaid
lining
outside
when
he
began
to
fear
detection
he
ripped
the
lining
out
and
left
the
cloak
in
the
state
it
is
now
in
the
possession
of
the
police
some
of
the
jags
and
cuts
have
been
sewn
up
i
suppose
by
one
of
the
servants
i
made
no
close
inquiries
that
cloak
he
added
with
a
passing
shiver
might
tell
queer
tales
of
our
sons
if
it
were
able
to
speak
how
did
you
know
it
was
cyril
breathed
dare
from
delves
delves
does
know
it
he
does
and
the
man
is
keeping
the
secret
out
of
consideration
for
us
delves
is
at
bottom
not
but
that
i
spoke
a
friendly
word
for
him
when
he
was
made
sergeant
it
all
tells
and
mr
ashley
she
asked
there
is
no
doubt
that
ashley
has
some
suspicion
the
very
fact
of
his
not
making
a
stir
in
it
proves
that
he
has
it
would
not
please
him
that
a
relative
as
cyril
is
should
stand
his
trial
for
felony
how
harshly
you
put
it
exclaimed
dare
bursting
into
tears
felony
nay
what
else
can
i
call
it
a
pause
ensued
dare
resumed
his
restless
pacing
dare
sat
with
her
handkerchief
to
her
face
presently
she
looked
up
they
said
it
was
halliburton
cloak
that
the
person
wore
who
went
to
change
the
cheque
it
was
not
halliburton
it
was
herbert
turned
inside
out
herbert
knew
nothing
about
it
for
i
questioned
him
he
had
gone
out
that
night
leaving
his
cloak
hanging
in
his
closet
i
asked
him
how
it
happened
that
his
cloak
on
the
inside
should
resemble
halliburton
and
he
said
it
was
a
coincidence
i
do
believe
him
i
entertain
little
doubt
that
it
was
so
contrived
with
a
view
to
enacting
some
mischief
in
fact
what
with
one
revelation
and
another
i
live
as
i
say
in
constant
dread
of
new
troubles
turning
up
bitter
most
bitter
were
these
revelations
to
dare
bitter
had
they
been
to
her
husband
too
swiftly
were
the
fruits
of
their
rearing
coming
home
to
them
bringing
their
recompense
there
must
be
a
fatality
upon
the
boys
he
reiterated
possibly
but
had
neither
parents
nor
children
done
aught
to
invoke
it
since
these
evils
have
come
upon
our
house
the
fate
of
anthony
the
uncertainty
overhanging
herbert
the
certain
guilt
of
cyril
resumed
dare
i
have
asked
myself
whether
the
money
we
inherited
from
old
cooper
may
not
have
wrought
ill
for
us
instead
of
good
have
wrought
ill
ay
brought
with
it
a
curse
instead
of
a
blessing
she
made
no
remark
he
warned
us
that
if
we
took
edgar
halliburton
share
it
would
not
bring
us
good
do
you
remember
how
eagerly
he
spoke
it
we
did
take
it
dare
added
dropping
his
voice
to
the
lowest
whisper
and
i
believe
it
has
just
acted
as
a
curse
upon
us
you
are
fanciful
she
cried
her
hands
shivering
as
she
raised
her
handkerchief
to
her
pale
face
no
there
no
fancy
in
it
we
should
have
done
well
to
attend
to
the
warning
of
the
dying
heaven
is
my
witness
that
at
the
time
such
a
thought
as
that
of
appropriating
it
ourselves
never
crossed
my
mind
we
launched
out
into
expense
and
the
other
share
became
a
necessity
to
us
it
is
that
expense
which
has
ruined
our
children
how
can
you
say
it
she
rejoined
lifting
her
hands
in
a
passionate
sort
of
manner
it
has
been
nothing
else
had
they
been
reared
more
plainly
they
would
not
have
acquired
those
extravagant
notions
which
have
proved
their
bane
without
that
inheritance
and
the
style
of
living
we
allowed
it
to
entail
upon
us
the
boys
must
have
understood
that
they
would
have
to
earn
money
before
they
spent
it
and
they
would
have
put
their
shoulders
to
the
wheel
julia
he
continued
halting
by
her
and
stretching
forth
his
troubled
face
until
it
nearly
touched
hers
it
might
have
been
well
now
well
with
them
and
with
us
had
our
children
been
obliged
to
battle
with
the
poverty
to
which
we
condemned

chapter
viii
an
ugly
vision
dare
had
not
taken
upon
himself
the
legal
conduct
of
his
son
herbert
case
it
had
been
intrusted
to
the
care
of
a
solicitor
in
helstonleigh
winthorne
this
gentleman
more
forcibly
than
any
one
else
urged
upon
herbert
dare
the
necessity
of
declaring
if
he
could
declare
where
he
had
been
on
the
night
of
the
murder
he
clearly
foresaw
that
if
his
client
persisted
in
his
present
silence
there
was
no
chance
of
any
result
but
the
worst
he
could
obtain
no
response
deaf
to
him
as
he
had
been
to
others
herbert
dare
would
disclose
nothing
in
vain
winthorne
pointed
to
consequences
first
by
delicate
hints
next
by
hints
not
delicate
then
by
speaking
out
broadly
and
fully
it
is
not
pleasant
to
tell
your
client
in
so
many
words
that
he
will
be
hanged
and
nothing
can
save
him
unless
he
compels
you
to
it
herbert
dare
so
compelled
winthorne
all
in
vain
winthorne
found
he
might
just
as
well
talk
to
the
walls
of
the
cell
herbert
dare
declared
in
the
most
positive
manner
that
he
had
been
out
the
whole
of
the
time
stated
from
eight
until
nearly
two
and
from
this
declaration
he
never
swerved
winthorne
was
perplexed
the
prisoner
assertions
were
so
uniformly
earnest
bearing
so
apparently
the
stamp
of
truth
that
he
could
not
disbelieve
him
or
rather
sometimes
he
believed
and
sometimes
he
doubted
it
is
true
that
herbert
declarations
did
wear
an
air
of
entire
truth
but
winthorne
had
been
engaged
for
criminal
offenders
before
and
knew
what
the
assertions
of
a
great
many
of
them
were
worth
down
deep
in
his
heart
he
reasoned
very
much
after
the
manner
of
sergeant
delves
if
he
had
been
absent
he
confess
it
to
save
his
neck
he
said
so
to
herbert
herbert
took
the
matter
on
the
whole
coolly
he
had
done
so
from
the
beginning
he
did
not
believe
that
his
neck
was
really
in
jeopardy
they
never
find
me
guilty
was
his
belief
he
could
not
avoid
standing
his
trial
that
was
a
calamity
from
which
there
was
no
escape
but
he
steadily
refused
to
look
at
its
results
in
a
sombre
light
you
tell
me
where
you
were
winthorne
one
morning
impulsively
asked
him
when
june
was
drawing
to
its
close
i
could
if
i
liked
replied
herbert
dare
i
suppose
you
mean
by
that
to
throw
discredit
on
what
i
say
winthorne
but
you
are
wrong
i
could
point
out
to
you
and
to
all
helstonleigh
where
i
was
that
night
but
i
will
not
do
so
i
have
my
reasons
and
i
will
not
then
you
will
fall
said
the
lawyer
the
very
fact
of
there
being
no
other
quarter
than
yourself
on
which
to
cast
a
shadow
of
suspicion
will
tell
against
you
you
have
been
bred
to
the
law
and
must
see
these
things
as
plainly
as
i
can
put
them
to
you
there
the
point
that
puzzles
me
who
it
can
have
been
that
did
the
injury
i
give
half
my
remaining
life
to
know
winthorne
thought
that
the
whole
of
it
to
judge
by
present
appearances
might
not
be
an
inconveniently
prolonged
period
but
he
did
not
say
so
what
is
your
objection
to
speak
he
asked
you
have
put
the
same
question
about
fifty
times
winthorne
and
never
get
any
different
answer
from
the
one
you
have
had
already
that
i
do
choose
to
state
it
i
suppose
you
were
not
committing
murder
in
another
quarter
of
the
town
were
you
i
suppose
i
was
not
equably
returned
herbert
then
failing
that
crime
there
no
other
in
the
decalogue
that
not
confess
to
to
save
my
life
whether
i
was
robbing
a
bank
or
setting
a
church
on
fire
i
tell
it
out
rather
than
be
hanged
by
the
neck
until
i
was
dead
ah
but
i
was
not
doing
either
said
herbert
then
there
the
less
reason
for
your
persisting
in
the
observance
of
so
much
mystery
my
doing
so
is
my
own
business
returned
herbert
no
it
is
not
your
own
business
objected
winthorne
you
assert
that
you
are
innocent
of
the
crime
with
which
you
are
charged
i
assert
nothing
but
the
truth
interrupted
herbert
good
then
if
you
are
innocent
and
if
you
can
prove
your
innocence
it
is
your
duty
to
your
family
to
do
it
a
man
duties
in
this
life
are
not
owing
to
himself
alone
above
all
a
son
he
owes
allegiance
to
his
father
and
mother
his
consideration
for
them
should
be
above
his
consideration
for
himself
if
you
can
prove
your
innocence
it
will
be
an
unpardonable
sin
not
to
do
it
a
sin
inflicted
on
your
family
i
ca
help
it
replied
herbert
in
his
obstinacy
i
have
my
reasons
for
not
speaking
and
i
shall
not
speak
you
will
surely
suffer
the
penalty
said
winthorne
then
i
must
suffer
it
returned
the
prisoner
but
it
is
one
thing
to
talk
and
another
to
act
many
a
brave
spirit
ready
and
willing
to
undergo
hanging
in
theory
would
find
his
heart
fail
and
his
bravery
altogether
die
out
were
he
really
required
to
reduce
it
to
practice
herbert
dare
was
only
human
after
july
had
come
in
and
the
time
for
the
opening
of
the
assizes
might
be
counted
by
hours
then
his
courage
began
to
flinch
he
spent
a
night
in
tossing
from
side
to
side
on
his
pallet
a
wide
difference
between
that
and
his
comfortable
bed
at
home
during
which
a
certain
ugly
apparatus
to
be
erected
for
his
especial
use
within
the
walls
of
the
prison
some
fine
saturday
morning
on
which
he
might
figure
by
no
means
gracefully
had
mentally
disturbed
his
rest
he
arose
unrefreshed
the
vision
of
that
possible
future
was
not
a
pleasant
one
herbert
remembered
once
when
he
had
been
a
college
boy
that
the
saturday
morning
occasional
drama
had
been
enacted
for
the
warning
and
edification
of
the
town
and
of
the
country
people
flocking
into
it
for
market
the
college
boys
had
determined
for
once
in
their
lives
to
see
the
sight
if
they
could
accomplish
it
the
ceremony
was
invariably
performed
at
eight
the
exhibition
closed
at
nine
and
the
boys
difficulty
was
how
to
arrive
at
the
scene
in
time
considering
that
it
was
only
at
the
striking
of
the
latter
hour
that
they
were
let
loose
down
the
steps
of
the
school
they
had
tried
the
between
the
cloisters
and
the
county
prison
and
found
that
by
dint
of
taking
the
shorter
way
through
the
back
streets
tearing
along
at
the
fleetest
pace
and
knocking
over
every
obstruction
human
animal
or
material
that
might
unfortunately
be
in
their
path
they
could
do
the
distance
in
four
minutes
arriving
rather
out
of
wind
true
but
that
was
nothing
four
minutes
they
did
not
see
their
way
if
the
curtain
descended
at
nine
sharp
as
good
be
forty
minutes
after
the
hour
as
four
in
point
of
practical
effect
but
the
helstonleigh
college
boys
as
you
may
sometimes
have
heard
remarked
before
were
not
wont
to
allow
difficulties
to
overmaster
them
if
there
was
a
possible
way
of
overcoming
obstacles
they
were
sure
to
find
it
consultations
had
been
anxious
to
request
the
to
allow
them
as
a
favour
to
depart
five
or
ten
minutes
before
the
usual
time
would
be
worse
than
useless
it
was
a
question
whether
he
ever
would
have
accorded
it
but
there
was
no
chance
of
it
on
morning
neither
could
the
whole
school
be
taken
summarily
with
spasms
or
croup
or
any
other
excruciating
malady
necessitating
compassion
and
an
early
dismissal
they
came
to
the
resolve
of
applying
to
the
official
who
had
the
cathedral
clock
under
his
charge
or
as
they
phrased
it
coming
over
the
by
dint
of
coaxing
or
bribery
or
some
other
element
of
persuasion
they
got
this
functionary
to
promise
to
put
the
clock
on
eight
minutes
on
that
particular
morning
and
it
was
done
and
at
eight
minutes
before
nine
by
the
sun
the
cathedral
clock
rang
out
its
nine
strokes
but
instead
of
the
master
lifting
his
finger
the
signal
for
the
boys
to
tear
forth
the
master
sat
quiet
at
his
desk
and
never
gave
it
he
sat
until
the
eight
minutes
had
gone
by
when
the
other
churches
in
the
town
gave
out
their
hour
he
sat
minutes
after
and
then
he
nodded
them
their
dismissal
the
twelve
minutes
had
seemed
to
the
boys
like
twelve
hours
where
the
hitch
was
they
never
knew
they
never
have
known
to
this
day
as
they
would
tell
you
themselves
whether
the
master
had
received
an
inkling
of
what
was
in
the
wind
or
whether
by
one
of
those
extraordinary
coincidences
that
sometimes
occur
in
life
he
for
that
one
morning
allowed
the
hour
to
slip
by
unheeded
had
not
heard
it
strike
they
could
not
tell
he
gave
out
no
explanation
then
or
afterwards
the
protested
that
he
had
been
true
had
not
breathed
a
hint
to
any
one
living
of
the
purposed
advancement
and
the
boys
had
no
reason
to
disbelieve
him
however
it
might
have
been
they
could
not
alter
it
it
was
four
minutes
past
nine
when
they
clattered
down
the
steps
away
they
tore
full
of
fallacious
hope
out
at
the
cloisters
through
the
cathedral
precincts
along
the
nearest
streets
and
arrived
within
the
given
four
minutes
rather
than
over
it
alas
for
human
expectations
the
prison
was
there
it
is
true
formidable
as
usual
but
all
trace
of
the
morning
jubilee
had
passed
away
not
only
had
the
chief
actor
been
removed
but
also
that
ugly
apparatus
which
herbert
dare
had
dreamt
of
might
have
afforded
them
some
gratification
to
contemplate
failing
the
greater
sight
the
college
boys
dumb
in
the
first
moment
of
their
disappointment
gave
vent
to
it
at
length
with
three
dismal
groans
the
echoes
of
which
might
have
been
heard
as
far
off
as
the
cathedral
groans
not
intended
for
the
unhappy
mortal
then
beyond
hearing
of
that
or
any
other
earthly
sound
not
for
the
officials
of
the
county
prison
all
too
that
morning
but
given
as
a
compliment
to
the
respected
gentleman
at
that
time
holding
the
situation
of
herbert
dare
remembered
this
it
was
rising
up
in
his
mind
with
strange
distinctness
he
himself
had
been
one
of
the
deputation
chosen
to
come
over
the
had
been
the
chief
persuader
of
that
functionary
would
the
college
boys
hasten
down
if
were
to
in
spite
of
his
bravery
he
broke
off
the
speculation
with
a
shudder
and
calling
the
turnkey
to
him
he
despatched
a
message
for
winthorne
was
it
the
remembrance
of
his
old
of
what
would
think
of
him
that
brought
about
what
no
other
consideration
had
been
able
to
effect
as
much
indulgence
as
it
was
possible
to
allow
a
prisoner
was
accorded
to
herbert
dare
indeed
it
may
be
questioned
whether
any
previous
prisoner
incarcerated
within
the
walls
of
the
county
prison
had
ever
enjoyed
so
much
the
governor
of
the
prison
and
dare
had
lived
on
intimate
terms
dare
and
his
two
elder
sons
had
been
familiar
in
their
legal
capacity
with
both
its
civil
and
criminal
prisoners
and
the
turnkeys
had
often
bowed
herbert
in
and
out
of
cells
as
they
now
bowed
out
winthorne
altogether
what
with
the
governor
friendly
feeling
and
the
turnkey
reverential
one
herbert
dare
obtained
more
privileges
than
the
ordinary
run
of
prisoners
the
message
was
at
once
taken
to
winthorne
and
it
brought
that
gentleman
back
again
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
tell
was
herbert
brief
salutation
when
he
entered
a
very
sensible
resolution
replied
the
lawyer
doubts
however
crossed
his
mind
as
he
spoke
whether
the
prisoner
was
not
about
to
set
up
some
plea
which
had
never
had
place
in
fact
in
like
manner
to
sergeant
delves
winthorne
had
arrived
at
the
firm
belief
that
there
was
nothing
to
tell
well
said
he
that
is
conditionally
resumed
herbert
dare
it
would
be
of
little
use
my
saying
i
was
at
such
and
such
a
place
unless
i
could
bring
forward
confirmatory
evidence
of
course
it
would
not
well
there
are
witnesses
who
could
give
this
satisfactory
evidence
but
the
question
is
will
they
be
willing
to
do
it
what
motive
or
excuse
could
they
have
for
refusing
returned
winthorne
when
a
life
is
at
stake
surely
there
is
no
man
so
lost
to
humanity
as
not
to
come
forward
and
save
it
if
it
be
in
his
power
circumstances
alter
cases
was
the
curt
reply
of
herbert
dare
was
it
your
doubt
as
to
whether
they
would
come
forward
that
caused
your
hesitation
to
call
on
them
to
do
so
asked
winthorne
something
not
pleasant
in
his
tones
not
altogether
i
foresaw
a
difficulty
in
it
i
foresee
it
still
winthorne
you
look
at
me
with
a
face
full
of
doubt
there
is
no
need
for
it
as
you
will
find
well
go
on
said
the
lawyer
for
herbert
had
stopped
the
thing
must
be
gone
about
in
a
very
cautious
manner
and
i
quite
see
how
it
can
be
done
resumed
herbert
slowly
winthorne
i
think
i
had
better
make
a
confidant
of
you
and
tell
you
the
whole
story
from
beginning
to
end
if
i
am
to
do
you
any
good
i
must
hear
it
i
expect
a
man
ca
work
in
the
dark
sit
down
then
and
i
begin
though
mind
i
tell
it
you
in
confidence
it
not
for
helstonleigh
but
you
will
see
the
expediency
of
being
silent
when
you
have
heard
it
chapter
ix
sergeant
delves
looks
up
the
following
saturday
was
the
day
fixed
for
the
opening
of
the
commission
at
helstonleigh
it
soon
came
round
and
the
streets
in
the
afternoon
wore
their
usual
holiday
appearance
the
high
procession
went
out
to
meet
the
judges
and
groups
stood
about
waiting
and
watching
for
its
return
amongst
other
people
blocking
up
the
way
might
be
observed
the
portly
person
of
sergeant
delves
he
strolled
along
seeming
to
look
at
nothing
but
his
keen
eye
was
everywhere
it
suddenly
fell
upon
winthorne
who
was
picking
his
way
through
the
crowd
as
fast
as
he
could
do
so
apparently
in
a
hurry
hurry
or
not
sergeant
delves
stopped
him
and
drew
him
to
a
safe
spot
beyond
the
reach
of
curious
ears
i
was
looking
for
you
winthorne
said
delves
in
a
confidential
tone
i
say
this
tale
that
dare
will
succeed
in
establishing
an
is
it
reliable
why
who
the
mischief
can
have
been
setting
that
afloat
returned
the
lawyer
in
tones
of
the
utmost
astonishment
not
unmixed
with
vexation
dare
himself
was
my
informant
replied
the
sergeant
i
was
in
the
prison
just
now
and
saw
him
in
the
yard
with
the
turnkey
he
called
me
aside
and
told
me
he
was
as
good
as
acquitted
then
he
is
an
idiot
for
his
pains
he
had
no
right
to
talk
of
it
even
to
you
am
dark
carelessly
returned
delves
i
do
wish
ill
to
the
dares
and
would
work
it
to
them
as
perhaps
some
of
them
could
tell
you
he
added
significantly
what
about
this
acquittal
that
he
talks
of
there
no
doubt
he
will
be
acquitted
he
will
prove
an
is
it
a
asked
the
sergeant
no
and
as
far
as
i
go
i
would
not
lend
myself
to
getting
up
anything
false
observed
the
solicitor
he
has
said
from
the
first
you
know
that
he
was
not
near
the
house
at
the
time
and
so
it
will
turn
out
has
he
confessed
where
he
was
after
all
his
standing
out
yes
to
me
it
will
be
disclosed
at
the
trial
he
was
after
no
good
i
know
nodded
the
sergeant
oracularly
winthorne
raised
his
eyebrows
and
slightly
jerked
his
shoulders
the
movement
may
have
meant
anything
or
nothing
he
did
not
reply
in
words
sergeant
delves
fell
into
a
reverie
he
roused
himself
from
it
to
take
a
searching
gaze
at
the
lawyer
sir
said
he
and
he
could
hardly
have
spoken
more
earnestly
had
his
life
depended
on
it
tell
me
the
truth
do
you
yourself
from
the
depths
of
your
own
judgment
believe
herbert
dare
to
have
been
innocent
delves
as
truly
as
that
you
and
i
now
stand
here
i
honestly
believe
that
he
had
no
more
to
do
with
his
brother
death
than
we
had
then
i
blest
if
i
do
take
up
the
other
scent
exclaimed
mr
delves
slapping
his
thigh
i
did
think
of
it
once
but
i
dropped
it
again
so
sure
was
i
that
it
was
master
herbert
what
scent
is
that
look
here
said
the
sergeant
but
now
it
my
turn
to
warn
you
to
be
dark
there
was
a
young
woman
met
anthony
dare
the
night
of
the
murder
when
he
was
going
down
to
the
star
and
garter
it
a
young
woman
he
did
not
behave
genteel
to
some
time
back
as
the
ghost
says
in
the
song
she
met
him
that
night
and
she
gave
him
a
bit
of
her
tongue
not
much
for
he
would
stop
to
listen
but
now
winthorne
it
has
crossed
my
mind
many
times
whether
she
might
not
have
watched
for
his
going
home
again
and
followed
him
followed
him
right
into
the
and
done
the
mischief
i
lay
a
guinea
it
was
her
added
the
sergeant
arriving
at
a
hasty
conclusion
i
shall
look
up
again
now
do
you
mean
that
young
woman
in
honey
fair
asked
winthorne
just
so
her
and
nobody
else
the
doubt
has
crossed
me
but
as
i
say
i
was
so
certain
it
was
the
brother
that
i
did
not
follow
it
up
could
a
woman
feeble
hand
inflict
such
injuries
debated
the
solicitor
be
hanged
politely
rejoined
the
sergeant
some
women
have
the
fists
of
men
and
the
strength
of
too
you
do
know
as
we
do
a
desperate
woman
will
do
anything
and
anthony
dare
remember
had
not
his
strength
in
him
that
night
winthorne
shook
his
head
that
girl
has
no
look
of
ferocity
about
her
i
should
question
it
being
her
let
see
what
is
her
name
listen
returned
the
sergeant
when
you
have
had
half
as
much
to
do
with
people
as
i
have
you
have
learnt
not
to
go
by
looks
her
name
is
caroline
mason
at
that
moment
the
cathedral
bells
rang
out
announcing
the
return
of
the
procession
the
advent
of
the
judges
as
if
the
sound
reminded
the
lawyer
of
the
speed
of
time
he
hastily
went
on
his
way
leaving
the
sergeant
to
use
his
eyes
and
ears
at
the
expense
of
the
crowd
i
wonder
how
the
prisoners
in
the
gaol
feels
remarked
a
woman
whom
the
sergeant
recognised
as
being
no
other
than
cross
she
had
just
come
out
of
a
warehouse
with
her
supply
of
work
for
the
ensuing
week
ah
poor
creatures
responded
another
of
the
group
and
was
brumm
i
wonder
how
young
dare
likes
it
or
how
old
dare
likes
it
if
he
can
hear
all
the
way
up
at
his
office
they
know
their
fate
soon
them
two
in
close
vicinity
to
this
colloquy
was
a
young
woman
drawn
against
the
wall
under
shelter
of
a
projecting
doorway
her
once
face
was
haggard
and
her
clothes
were
scanty
it
was
for
this
reason
perhaps
that
she
appeared
to
shun
observation
sergeant
delves
apparently
without
any
other
design
than
that
of
working
his
way
leisurely
through
the
throng
edged
himself
up
to
her
looking
out
for
the
show
miss
mason
caroline
turned
her
spiritless
eyes
upon
him
i
waiting
till
a
way
cleared
for
me
to
get
through
without
pushing
against
folks
and
contaminating
what
the
show
to
me
or
me
to
it
at
the
last
assizes
in
march
when
the
judges
came
in
young
anthony
dare
made
one
in
the
streets
looking
on
resumed
the
sergeant
chatting
affably
i
saw
him
and
spoke
to
him
and
now
he
is
gone
where
there
no
shows
to
see
she
made
no
reply
the
women
there
pointing
his
thumb
at
the
group
of
talkers
hard
by
are
saying
that
herbert
dare
wo
like
the
sound
of
the
college
hey
me
look
at
those
young
toads
of
college
boys
just
let
out
of
school
broke
off
the
sergeant
as
a
tribe
of
some
twenty
of
the
king
scholars
came
fighting
and
elbowing
their
way
through
the
throng
to
the
front
they
are
just
like
so
many
wild
colts
maybe
the
prisoner
herbert
dare
is
now
casting
his
thoughts
back
to
the
time
when
he
made
one
of
the
band
and
was
as
free
from
care
as
they
are
it
not
so
long
ago
caroline
mason
asked
a
question
somewhat
abruptly
will
he
be
found
guilty
sir
do
you
think
the
sergeant
turned
the
tail
of
his
keen
eye
upon
her
and
answered
the
question
by
asking
another
do
you
she
shook
her
head
i
do
think
he
was
guilty
you
do
no
i
do
why
should
one
brother
kill
another
very
true
coughed
the
sergeant
but
somebody
must
have
done
it
if
herbert
dare
did
not
who
did
ah
who
did
i
like
to
know
she
passionately
added
he
had
folks
in
this
town
that
owed
him
grudges
had
anthony
dare
if
my
vision
did
deceive
me
i
saw
you
talking
to
him
that
very
same
night
carelessly
observed
the
sergeant
did
you
see
me
she
rejoined
apparently
as
much
at
ease
as
the
sergeant
himself
i
had
to
do
an
errand
at
that
end
of
the
town
and
i
met
him
and
told
him
what
he
was
i
had
spoke
to
him
for
months
and
months
for
years
i
think
i
had
slipped
into
doors
down
entries
anywhere
to
avoid
him
if
i
saw
him
coming
but
a
feeling
came
over
me
to
speak
to
him
then
i
glad
i
did
i
hope
the
truths
i
said
to
him
went
along
with
him
to
enliven
him
on
his
journey
did
you
see
him
after
that
later
in
the
evening
resumed
the
inspector
putting
the
question
sociably
and
stretching
his
neck
up
to
obtain
a
view
of
something
at
a
distance
no
i
did
she
replied
but
i
would
if
i
had
thought
it
was
going
to
be
his
last
i
have
bade
him
remember
all
his
good
works
where
he
was
going
to
i
almost
have
went
with
him
i
would
to
have
heard
how
he
answered
for
them
up
there
caroline
mason
glanced
upwards
to
indicate
the
sky
when
a
loud
flourish
of
trumpets
from
the
advancing
heralds
sounded
close
upon
them
as
they
rode
up
at
a
foot
pace
they
dropped
their
trumpets
and
the
mounted
quickly
followed
their
javelins
in
rest
a
carriage
or
two
a
few
more
officials
and
then
advanced
the
equipage
of
the
high
sheriff
only
one
of
the
judges
was
in
it
fully
robed
a
fine
man
with
a
benign
countenance
a
grave
smile
was
on
it
as
he
spoke
to
the
sheriff
who
sat
opposite
to
him
his
chaplain
by
his
side
sergeant
delves
attention
was
distracted
for
an
instant
and
when
he
looked
round
again
caroline
mason
had
disappeared
he
just
caught
sight
of
her
in
the
distance
winding
her
way
through
the
crowd
her
head
down
did

she

the
sergeant
in
soliloquy
go
on
go
on
my
lady
for
the
present
you
are
about
to
be
a
bit
looked
after
how
the
prisoners
feel
and
herbert
dare
amongst
them
as
the
joyous
sounds
outside
fell
upon
their
ears
the
blast
of
the
trumpets
the
sweetness
of
the
bells
the
stir
of
life
penetrating
within
the
walls
of
the
city
and
county
prisons
did
they
feel
that
the
pomp
and
show
run
after
as
a
holiday
sight
was
only
a
cruel
advent
to
them
that
the
formidable
and
fiery
vision
in
the
scarlet
robe
and
flowing
wig
who
sat
in
the
carriage
bending
his
serene
face
upon
the
mob
collected
to
stare
and
shout
might
prove
the
pronouncer
of
their
doom
a
doom
that
should
close
the
portals
of
this
world
upon
them
and
open
those
of
eternity
chapter
x
the
trial
tuesday
morning
was
the
day
fixed
for
the
trial
of
herbert
dare
you
might
have
walked
upon
the
people
heads
in
the
vicinity
of
the
guildhall
for
all
the
town
wished
to
get
in
to
hear
it
of
course
only
a
very
small
portion
of
the
town
relatively
speaking
could
have
its
wish
or
succeed
in
fighting
a
way
to
a
place
of
the
rest
some
went
back
to
their
homes
disappointed
and
exploding
and
the
rest
collected
outside
and
blocked
up
the
street
the
police
had
their
work
cut
out
that
day
whilst
the
heralding
in
the
judges
experienced
great
difficulty
in
keeping
clear
the
passages
the
heat
in
court
would
be
desperate
as
the
day
advanced
sir
william
leader
as
senior
judge
took
his
seat
in
the
criminal
court
it
was
he
whom
you
saw
in
the
sheriff
carriage
on
saturday
the
same
benignant
face
was
bent
upon
the
crowded
court
that
had
been
bent
upon
the
street
mob
the
same
penetrating
eye
the
same
grave
calm
bearing
the
prisoner
was
immediately
placed
at
the
bar
and
all
eyes
strange
or
familiar
were
strained
to
look
at
him
they
saw
a
tall
handsome
young
man
looking
too
gentlemanly
to
stand
in
the
dock
he
was
habited
in
deep
mourning
his
countenance
usually
somewhat
conspicuous
for
its
bright
complexion
was
pale
probably
from
the
moment
emotion
and
his
white
handkerchief
was
lifted
to
his
mouth
as
he
moved
forward
otherwise
he
was
calm
old
anthony
dale
was
in
court
looking
far
more
agitated
than
his
son
preliminaries
were
gone
through
and
the
trial
began
prisoner
at
the
bar
how
say
you
are
you
guilty
or
not
guilty
herbert
dare
raised
his
eyes
fearlessly
and
pleaded
in
a
firm
tone
not
guilty
the
leading
counsel
for
the
prosecution
serjeant
seeitall
stated
the
case
his
address
occupied
some
time
and
he
then
proceeded
to
call
witnesses
one
of
the
first
examined
was
betsy
carter
she
deposed
to
the
facts
of
having
sat
up
with
the
and
joseph
until
the
return
of
and
dare
and
their
daughter
to
having
then
gone
into
the
with
a
light
to
look
for
dare
pipe
which
she
had
left
there
in
the
morning
when
cleaning
the
room
in
moving
forward
with
the
candle
i
saw
something
dark
on
the
ground
continued
betsy
who
when
her
first
timidity
had
gone
off
seemed
inclined
to
be
communicative
at
the
first
glance
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
gentlemen
gone
to
sleep
there
but
when
i
stooped
down
with
the
light
i
saw
it
was
the
face
of
the
dead
awful
it
looked
what
did
you
next
do
demanded
the
examining
counsel
screeched
out
gentlemen
responded
betsy
what
else
i
went
out
of
the
room
screeching
to
joseph
in
the
hall
and
master
came
in
from
outside
the
front
door
where
he
was
waiting
all
peaceful
and
ignorant
for
his
pipe
little
thinking
what
there
was
so
close
to
him
i
screeched
out
all
the
more
gentlemen
when
i
remembered
the
quarrel
that
had
took
place
at
dinner
that
afternoon
and
i
knew
it
was
nobody
but
herbert
that
had
done
the
murder
the
witness
was
sharply
told
to
confine
herself
to
evidence
it
could
be
nobody
else
retorted
betsy
who
once
set
going
was
a
match
for
any
there
was
the
cloak
to
prove
it
herbert
had
gone
out
in
the
cloak
that
very
night
and
the
poor
dead
gentleman
was
lying
on
it
which
proves
it
must
have
come
off
in
the
scuffle
between
the
fact
of
the
quarrel
the
facts
connected
with
the
cloak
as
well
as
all
other
facts
had
been
mentioned
by
the
learned
serjeant
seeitall
in
his
opening
address
the
witness
was
questioned
as
to
what
she
knew
of
the
quarrel
but
it
appeared
that
she
had
not
been
present
consequently
could
not
testify
to
it
the
cloak
she
could
say
more
about
and
spoke
of
it
confidently
as
herbert
how
did
you
know
the
cloak
found
under
the
dead
man
was
mr
herbert
interposed
the
prisoner
counsel
chattaway
because
i
did
returned
the
witness
i
ask
you
how
you
knew
it
by
lots
of
tokens
she
answered
by
the
shining
black
clasp
for
one
thing
and
by
the
tears
and
jags
in
it
for
another
nobody
has
ever
pretended
it
was
not
the
cloak
i
have
seen
it
fifty
times
hanging
up
in
herbert
closet
you
saw
the
prisoner
going
out
in
it
that
evening
yes
i
did
she
answered
i
was
looking
out
at
miss
chamber
window
and
i
saw
him
come
out
of
the
window
and
go
off
towards
the
front
gates
the
gentlemen
often
went
out
through
the
window
instead
of
at
the
hall
door
the
prisoner
says
he
came
back
immediately
and
left
his
cloak
in
the
going
out
finally
without
it
did
you
see
him
come
back
no
i
did
replied
betsy
how
long
did
you
remain
at
the
window
not
long
did
you
remain
long
enough
for
him
to
cross
the
lawn
to
the
front
entrance
gates
and
come
back
again
no
i
do
think
i
did
sir
the
court
will
please
take
note
of
that
answer
said
chattaway
who
was
aware
that
a
great
deal
had
been
made
of
the
fact
of
the
housemaid
having
seen
him
go
out
in
the
cloak
you
left
the
window
then
immediately
pretty
near
immediately
i
do
think
i
stayed
long
enough
at
it
for
him
to
come
back
from
the
front
gates
if
he
did
come
i
have
never
said
i
did
she
resentfully
continued
what
time
was
it
that
you
saw
him
go
out
i
had
took
particular
notice
of
the
time
it
was
dusk
i
was
turning
down
my
beds
and
i
generally
do
that
a
little
before
nine
the
next
room
i
went
into
was
mr
anthony
the
deceased
was
in
it
was
he
not
he
was
in
it
stretched
full
length
upon
the
sofa
he
had
his
head
down
on
the
cushion
and
his
feet
up
over
the
arm
at
the
foot
all
comfortable
and
easy
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
some
glasses
and
things
on
the
table
near
him
are
you
come
bothering
in
here
for
he
asked
so
i
begged
his
pardon
for
you
see
gentlemen
i
did
know
he
was
there
and
i
went
out
again
and
met
joseph
carrying
up
a
note
to
him
a
little
while
after
that
he
went
out
the
witness
propensity
to
degenerate
into
gossip
appeared
irrepressible
several
times
she
was
stopped
once
by
the
judge
of
how
many
servants
did
the
household
of
dare
consist
she
was
asked
there
were
four
of
us
gentlemen
did
you
all
sit
up
that
night
all
but
the
cook
she
went
to
bed
and
the
family
those
who
were
at
home
went
to
bed
all
of
them
sir
the
governess
went
early
she
was
not
well
and
miss
rosa
and
miss
minny
went
and
the
two
young
gentlemen
went
when
they
came
home
from
playing
cricket
in
point
of
fact
then
no
one
was
up
except
you
three
servants
in
the
kitchen
nobody
sir
and
you
heard
no
noise
in
the
house
until
the
return
of
and
mrs
dare
we
never
heard
nothing
responded
betsy
we
were
sitting
quietly
in
the
kitchen
me
and
the
at
work
and
joseph
asleep
we
never
heard
any
noise
at
all
this
was
the
substance
of
what
was
asked
her
joseph
was
next
called
and
gave
his
testimony
he
deposed
to
having
fastened
up
the
house
at
eleven
with
the
exception
of
the
window
that
was
left
open
in
obedience
to
orders
all
other
facts
within
his
knowledge
he
also
testified
to
the
governess
signorina
varsini
was
called
and
questioned
upon
two
points
what
she
had
seen
and
heard
of
the
quarrel
and
of
the
subsequent
conduct
of
anthony
and
herbert
to
each
other
in
the
but
her
testimony
amounted
to
nothing
and
she
might
as
well
not
have
been
troubled
she
was
also
asked
whether
she
had
heard
any
noise
in
the
house
between
eleven
and
the
return
of
and
dare
she
replied
that
she
did
not
hear
any
for
she
had
been
asleep
she
went
to
sleep
long
before
eleven
and
did
not
wake
up
until
aroused
by
the
commotion
caused
by
the
finding
of
the
body
the
witness
was
proceeding
to
favour
the
court
with
her
own
conviction
that
the
prisoner
was
innocent
but
was
brought
up
with
a
summary
notice
that
that
was
not
evidence
and
that
if
she
knew
nothing
more
she
might
withdraw
upon
which
she
honoured
the
bench
with
an
elaborate
curtsey
and
retired
not
a
witness
throughout
the
day
gave
evidence
with
more
absolute
equanimity
lord
hawkesley
was
examined
also
brittle
the
latter
coming
to
helstonleigh
on
his
subpoena
but
to
give
the
testimony
of
all
the
witnesses
in
length
would
only
be
to
repeat
what
has
already
been
related
it
will
be
sufficient
to
extract
a
few
questions
here
and
there
what
were
the
games
played
in
your
rooms
that
evening
was
asked
of
brittle
some
played
whist
some
écarté
at
which
did
the
deceased
play
at
whist
was
he
a
loser
or
a
gainer
a
loser
but
to
a
very
trifling
amount
we
were
playing
points
he
and
myself
played
against
lord
hawkesley
and
captain
bellew
we
broke
up
because
he
the
deceased
was
not
sufficiently
sober
to
play
was
he
sober
when
he
joined
you
by
no
means
he
appeared
to
have
been
drinking
rather
freely
and
he
took
more
in
my
rooms
which
made
him
worse
why
did
you
accompany
him
home
he
was
scarcely
in
a
state
to
proceed
alone
and
i
felt
no
objection
to
a
walk
it
was
a
fine
night
did
he
speak
during
the
evening
of
the
dispute
which
had
taken
place
between
him
and
his
brother
interposed
the
judge
he
did
not
my
lord
a
slight
incident
occurred
as
we
were
going
to
his
home
which
it
may
be
perhaps
as
well
to
mention
you
must
mention
everything
which
bears
upon
this
unhappy
case
sir
interrupted
the
judge
you
are
sworn
to
tell
the
whole
truth
i
do
not
suppose
it
does
bear
upon
it
directly
my
lord
had
i
attached
importance
to
it
i
should
have
spoken
of
it
before
in
passing
the
turning
which
leads
to
the
a
man
met
us
and
began
to
abuse
the
deceased
the
deceased
was
inclined
to
stop
and
return
it
but
i
drew
him
on
of
what
nature
was
the
abuse
asked
the
counsel
i
do
not
recollect
the
precise
terms
it
was
to
the
effect
that
he
the
deceased
tippled
away
his
money
instead
of
paying
his
debts
the
man
backed
against
the
wall
as
he
spoke
he
appeared
to
have
had
rather
too
much
himself
i
drew
the
deceased
on
and
we
were
soon
out
of
hearing
what
became
of
the
man
i
do
not
know
we
left
him
standing
against
the
wall
he
called
loudly
after
the
deceased
to
know
when
his
bill
was
to
be
paid
i
judged
him
to
be
some
petty
tradesman
did
he
follow
you
no
at
least
we
heard
no
more
of
him
afterwards
i
saw
the
deceased
safely
within
his
own
gate
and
left
him
what
state
as
to
sobriety
was
the
deceased
in
then
he
was
what
may
be
called
replied
the
witness
he
could
talk
but
his
words
were
not
very
distinct
could
he
walk
alone
after
a
fashion
he
stumbled
as
he
walked
what
time
was
this
about
eleven
i
think
the
struck
directly
after
i
left
him
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
as
you
returned
did
you
see
anything
of
the
man
who
had
accosted
the
deceased
not
anything
strange
to
say
the
very
man
thus
spoken
of
was
in
court
listening
to
the
trial
upon
hearing
the
evidence
given
by
brittle
he
voluntarily
came
forward
as
a
witness
he
said
he
had
been
having
a
drop
and
it
had
made
him
abusive
but
that
anthony
dare
had
owed
him
money
long
for
work
done
mending
and
making
he
was
a
jobbing
tailor
and
the
bill
was
a
matter
of
fourteen
pounds
anthony
dare
had
only
put
him
off
and
off
he
was
a
poor
man
with
a
wife
and
family
to
keep
and
he
wanted
the
money
badly
but
now
he
supposed
he
should
never
be
paid
he
lived
close
to
the
spot
where
he
met
the
deceased
and
the
gentleman
who
had
just
given
evidence
and
he
could
prove
that
he
went
home
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
and
was
in
bed
at
eleven
what
with
debts
and
various
other
things
he
concluded
the
town
had
had
enough
to
rue
in
young
anthony
dare
still
the
poor
fellow
did
deserve
such
a
shocking
fate
as
murder
and
he
would
have
been
the
first
to
protect
him
from
it
that
the
evidence
was
given
in
good
faith
was
undoubted
he
was
known
to
the
town
as
a
harmless
inoffensive
man
addicted
though
upon
rare
occasions
to
taking
more
than
was
good
for
him
when
he
was
apt
to
dilate
upon
his
grievances
the
constable
who
had
been
on
duty
that
night
near
dare
residence
was
the
next
witness
called
did
you
see
the
deceased
that
night
was
asked
of
him
yes
sir
i
did
was
the
reply
i
saw
him
walking
home
with
the
gentleman
who
has
given
evidence
brittle
i
noticed
that
young
dare
talked
thick
as
if
he
had
been
drinking
did
they
appear
to
be
on
good
terms
very
good
terms
sir
brittle
was
laughing
when
he
opened
the
gate
for
the
deceased
and
told
him
to
mind
he
did
not
kiss
the
grass
or
something
to
that
effect
were
you
close
to
them
quite
close
sir
i
said
night
to
the
deceased
but
he
seemed
not
to
notice
it
i
stood
and
watched
him
over
the
grass
he
reeled
as
he
walked
what
time
was
this
nigh
upon
eleven
sir
did
you
detect
any
signs
of
people
moving
within
the
house
not
any
sir
the
house
seemed
quite
still
and
the
blinds
were
down
before
the
windows
did
you
see
any
one
enter
the
gate
that
night
besides
the
deceased
not
any
one
not
the
prisoner
not
any
one
repeated
the
policeman
did
you
see
anything
of
the
prisoner
later
between
one
and
two
the
time
he
alleges
as
that
of
his
going
home
i
never
saw
the
prisoner
at
all
that
night
sir
he
could
have
gone
in
as
he
states
without
your
seeing
him
interposed
the
prisoner
counsel
yes
certainly
a
dozen
times
over
my
beat
extended
to
beyond
mr
dare
one
witness
who
was
placed
in
the
box
created
a
profound
sensation
for
it
was
the
unhappy
father
anthony
dare
since
the
deed
was
committed
two
months
ago
dare
had
been
growing
old
his
brow
was
furrowed
his
cheeks
were
wrinkled
his
hair
was
turning
white
and
he
looked
as
he
obeyed
the
call
to
the
as
a
man
sinking
under
a
heavy
weight
of
care
many
of
the
countenances
present
expressed
deep
commiseration
for
him
he
was
sworn
and
various
questions
were
asked
him
amongst
others
whether
he
knew
anything
of
the
quarrel
which
had
taken
place
between
his
two
sons
personally
nothing
was
the
reply
i
was
not
at
home
it
has
been
testified
that
when
they
were
parted
your
son
herbert
threatened
his
brother
is
he
of
a
revengeful
disposition
no
replied
dare
with
emotion
that
i
can
truly
say
he
is
not
my
poor
son
anthony
was
somewhat
given
to
sullenness
but
herbert
never
was
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
between
them
of
late
i
believe
i
fear
there
had
been
it
is
stated
that
you
yourself
upon
leaving
home
that
evening
left
them
a
warning
not
to
quarrel
was
it
so
i
believe
i
did
anthony
entered
the
house
as
we
were
leaving
it
and
i
did
say
something
to
him
to
that
effect
the
prisoner
was
not
present
no
he
had
not
returned
it
is
proved
that
he
came
home
later
dined
and
went
out
again
at
dusk
it
does
not
appear
that
he
was
seen
afterwards
by
any
member
of
your
household
until
you
yourself
went
up
to
his
room
and
found
him
there
after
the
discovery
of
the
body
his
own
account
is
that
he
had
only
recently
returned
do
you
know
where
he
was
during
his
absence
no
or
where
he
went
to
no
repeated
the
witness
in
sadly
faltering
tones
for
he
knew
that
this
was
the
one
weak
point
in
the
defence
he
will
not
tell
you
he
declines
to
do
so
but
the
witness
added
with
emotion
he
has
denied
his
guilt
to
me
from
the
first
in
the
most
decisive
manner
and
i
solemnly
believe
him
to
be
innocent
why
he
will
not
state
where
he
was
i
can
not
conceive
but
not
a
shade
of
doubt
rests
upon
my
mind
that
he
could
state
it
if
he
chose
and
that
it
would
be
the
means
of
establishing
the
fact
of
his
absence
i
would
not
assert
this
if
i
did
not
believe
it
said
the
witness
raising
his
trembling
hand
they
were
both
my
boys
the
one
destroyed
was
my
eldest
perhaps
my
dearest
and
i
declare
that
i
would
not
knowingly
screen
his
assassin
although
that
assassin
were
his
brother
the
case
for
the
prosecution
concluded
and
the
defence
was
entered
upon
the
prisoner
counsel
two
of
them
eminent
men
chattaway
himself
being
no
secondary
light
in
the
forensic
world
laboured
under
one
disadvantage
as
it
appeared
to
the
crowded
court
they
exerted
all
their
eloquence
in
seeking
to
divert
the
guilt
from
the
prisoner
but
they
could
not
distort
facts
as
they
might
call
upon
imagination
as
they
would
they
could
not
conjure
up
the
ghost
of
any
other
channel
to
which
to
direct
suspicion
there
lay
the
weak
point
as
it
had
lain
throughout
if
herbert
dare
was
not
guilty
who
was
the
family
quietly
sleeping
in
their
beds
were
beyond
the
pale
of
suspicion
the
household
equally
so
and
no
trace
of
any
midnight
intruder
to
the
house
could
be
found
it
was
a
grave
for
the
prisoner
counsel
but
such
are
as
nothing
to
an
expert
pleader
bit
by
bit
chattaway
disposed
or
seemed
to
dispose
of
every
argument
that
could
tell
against
the
prisoner
the
presence
of
the
cloak
in
the
from
which
so
much
appearance
of
guilt
had
been
deduced
he
converted
into
a
negative
proof
of
innocence
had
he
been
the
one
engaged
in
the
struggle
argued
the
learned
would
he
have
been
mad
enough
to
leave
his
own
cloak
there
underneath
his
victim
a
damning
proof
of
guilt
no
that
at
any
rate
he
would
have
taken
away
the
very
fact
of
the
cloak
being
under
the
murdered
man
was
a
most
indisputable
proof
as
he
regarded
it
that
the
prisoner
remained
totally
ignorant
of
what
had
happened
ignorant
of
his
unfortunate
brother
being
at
all
in
the
why
had
he
only
surmised
that
his
brother
was
lying
wounded
or
dead
in
the
room
would
he
not
have
hastened
to
remove
his
cloak
out
of
it
before
it
should
be
seen
there
knowing
as
he
must
know
that
from
the
very
terms
on
which
he
and
his
brother
had
been
it
would
be
looked
upon
as
a
proof
of
his
guilt
the
argument
told
well
with
the
jury
probably
with
the
judge
bit
by
bit
so
did
he
thus
dispose
of
the
suspicious
circumstances
of
all
except
one
and
that
was
the
great
one
the
one
that
nobody
could
get
over
the
refusal
of
the
prisoner
to
state
where
he
was
that
night
all
in
good
time
gentlemen
of
the
jury
said
chattaway
some
murmured
words
reaching
his
ear
that
the
omission
was
deemed
ominous
i
am
coming
to
that
later
and
i
shall
prove
as
complete
and
distinct
an
as
it
was
ever
my
lot
to
submit
to
an
enlightened
court
the
court
listened
the
jury
listened
the
spectators
listened
and
hoped
he
might
he
had
spoken
for
the
most
part
to
incredulous
ears
chapter
xi
the
witnesses
for
the
alibi
when
the
speech
of
the
counsel
ended
and
the
time
came
for
the
production
of
the
witness
or
witnesses
who
were
to
prove
the
there
appeared
to
be
some
delay
the
intense
heat
of
the
court
had
been
growing
greater
with
every
hour
the
rays
of
the
afternoon
sun
now
sinking
lower
and
lower
in
the
heavens
had
only
brought
with
them
a
more
deadly
feeling
of
suffocation
but
to
go
out
for
a
breath
of
air
even
had
the
thronged
state
of
the
passages
permitted
the
movement
appeared
to
enter
into
no
one
thoughts
their
suspense
was
too
keen
their
interest
too
absorbing
who
were
those
mysterious
witnesses
that
would
testify
to
the
innocence
of
herbert
dare
a
stir
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
court
where
it
joined
the
other
passage
every
eye
was
strained
to
see
every
ear
to
listen
as
an
usher
came
clearing
the
way
by
your
leave
there
by
your
leave
room
for
a
witness
the
spectators
looked
and
stretched
their
necks
and
looked
again
a
few
among
them
experienced
a
strange
thrill
of
disappointment
and
felt
that
they
should
have
much
pleasure
in
being
allowed
the
privilege
of
boxing
the
usher
ears
for
he
preceded
no
one
more
important
than
richard
winthorne
the
lawyer
ah
but
wait
a
bit
what
short
and
slight
figure
is
it
that
winthorne
is
guiding
along
the
angry
crowd
have
not
caught
sight
of
her
yet
but
when
they
do
when
the
drooping
shrinking
form
is
at
length
in
the
her
eyes
never
raised
her
lovely
face
bent
in
timid
dread
then
a
murmur
arises
and
shakes
the
court
to
its
foundation
the
judge
feels
for
his
glasses
rarely
used
and
puts
them
across
his
nose
and
gazes
at
her
a
fair
girl
attired
in
the
simple
modest
garb
peculiar
to
the
sect
called
quakers
not
more
modest
than
the
lovely
and
gentle
face
she
does
not
take
the
oath
only
the
affirmation
peculiar
to
her
people
what
is
your
name
commenced
the
prisoner
counsel
that
she
spoke
words
in
reply
was
evident
by
the
moving
of
her
lips
but
they
could
not
be
heard
you
must
speak
up
interposed
the
judge
in
tones
of
kindness
a
deep
struggle
for
breath
an
effort
of
which
even
those
around
could
see
the
pain
and
the
answer
came
they
call
me
anna
i
am
the
daughter
of
samuel
lynn
where
do
your
live
i
live
with
my
father
and
patience
in
the
london
road
what
do
you
know
of
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
a
pause
she
probably
did
not
understand
the
sort
of
answer
required
one
came
that
was
unexpected
i
know
him
to
be
innocent
of
the
crime
of
which
he
is
accused
how
do
you
know
this
because
he
could
not
have
been
near
the
spot
at
the
time
where
was
he
then
with
me
but
the
reply
came
forth
in
so
faint
a
whisper
that
again
she
had
to
be
enjoined
to
speak
louder
and
she
repeated
it
using
different
words
he
was
at
our
house
at
what
hour
did
he
go
to
your
house
it
was
past
nine
when
he
came
up
first
and
what
time
did
he
leave
it
was
about
one
in
the
morning
the
answer
appeared
to
create
some
stir
a
late
hour
for
a
sober
little
quakeress
to
confess
to
was
he
spending
the
evening
with
your
friends
no
did
they
not
know
he
was
there
no
it
was
a
clandestine
visit
to
yourself
then
where
were
they
a
pause
and
a
very
trembling
answer
they
were
in
bed
oh
you
were
entertaining
him
by
yourself
then
she
burst
into
tears
the
judge
let
fall
his
glasses
as
though
under
the
pressure
of
some
annoyance
every
feature
of
his
fine
face
expressive
of
compassion
it
may
be
his
thoughts
had
flown
to
daughters
of
his
own
the
crowd
stood
with
open
mouths
gaping
with
undisguised
astonishment
and
the
burly
queen
counsel
proceeded
and
so
he
prolonged
his
visit
until
one
in
the
morning
i
was
locked
out
she
sobbed
that
is
how
he
came
to
stay
so
late
bit
by
bit
with
question
and
it
all
came
out
that
herbert
dare
had
been
in
the
habit
of
paying
stolen
visits
to
the
field
and
that
anna
had
been
in
the
habit
of
meeting
him
there
that
she
had
gone
in
on
this
night
just
before
ten
which
was
later
than
she
had
ever
stayed
out
before
but
finding
hester
had
to
go
out
for
medicine
for
patience
she
had
run
to
the
field
again
to
take
a
book
to
the
prisoner
and
that
upon
attempting
to
enter
soon
afterwards
she
found
the
door
locked
hester
having
met
the
doctor
boy
and
come
back
at
once
she
told
it
all
as
simply
and
guilelessly
as
a
child
what
were
you
doing
all
that
time
from
ten
until
one
in
the
morning
i
was
sitting
on
the
crying
was
the
prisoner
with
you
yes
he
stood
by
me
part
of
the
time
telling
me
not
to
be
afraid
and
the
rest
of
the
time
more
than
an
hour
i
think
he
was
working
at
the
wires
of
the
pantry
window
to
try
to
get
in
was
he
all
that
time
at
the
wires
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
remembered
the
pantry
window
he
wanted
to
knock
up
hester
but
i
was
afraid
to
let
him
i
feared
she
might
tell
patience
and
they
would
have
been
so
angry
with
me
he
got
in
at
last
at
the
pantry
window
and
he
opened
the
kitchen
window
for
me
and
i
went
in
by
it
and
you
mean
to
say
he
was
all
that
time
till
one
in
the
morning
forcing
the
wires
of
a
pantry
window
cried
sergeant
seeitall
it
was
nearly
one
i
am
telling
thee
the
truth
and
you
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
prisoner
from
the
time
he
first
came
to
the
field
at
nine
until
he
left
you
at
one
only
for
the
few
minutes
it
may
have
been
four
or
five
when
i
ran
in
and
came
out
again
with
the
book
he
waited
in
the
field
what
time
was
that
the
ten
bell
was
going
in
helstonleigh
we
could
hear
it
he
was
with
you
all
the
rest
of
the
time
yes
all
when
he
was
working
at
the
pantry
window
i
could
not
see
him
because
he
was
round
the
angle
of
the
house
but
i
could
hear
him
at
the
wires
not
a
minute
of
the
time
but
i
heard
him
he
was
more
than
an
hour
at
the
wires
as
i
have
told
thee
and
until
he
began
at
the
wires
he
was
standing
up
by
me
telling
me
not
to
be
afraid
all
the
time
you
affirm
this
i
am
affirming
all
that
i
say
to
thee
i
am
speaking
as
before
my
maker
do
you
think
it
is
a
pretty
confession
for
a
young
lady
to
make
she
burst
into
fresh
tears
the
judge
turned
his
grave
face
upon
sergeant
seeitall
but
the
sergeant
had
impudence
enough
for
ten
pray
how
many
times
had
that
pretty
little
midnight
drama
been
enacted
he
continued
whilst
anna
sobbed
in
distress
never
before
burst
forth
a
deep
voice
do
you
see
it
was
a
pure
accident
as
she
tells
you
how
dare
you
treat
her
as
you
might
a
shameless
witness
the
interruption
one
of
powerful
emotion
had
come
from
the
prisoner
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
anna
started
and
looked
round
hurriedly
to
the
quarter
whence
it
came
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
raised
her
eyes
to
the
court
since
entering
the
she
had
glanced
up
to
answer
whoever
questioned
her
and
that
was
all
well
said
sergeant
seeitall
as
if
demanding
what
else
she
might
have
to
communicate
i
have
no
more
to
tell
i
have
told
thee
all
i
know
it
was
nearly
one
when
he
went
away
and
i
never
saw
him
after
did
the
prisoner
wear
a
cloak
when
he
came
to
the
field
that
night
no
he
wore
one
sometimes
but
he
did
not
have
it
on
that
night
it
was
very
warm
but
at
that
moment
anna
lynn
became
conscious
that
a
familiar
face
was
strained
upon
her
from
the
midst
of
the
crowd
familiar
and
yet
not
familiar
for
the
face
was
distorted
from
its
natural
look
and
was
blanched
as
of
one
in
the
last
agony
the
face
of
samuel
lynn
with
a
sharp
cry
of
pain
of
dread
anna
fell
on
the
floor
in
a
fainting
fit
what
the
shame
of
being
before
that
public
court
of
answering
the
searching
questions
of
the
counsel
had
failed
to
take
away
her
senses
the
sight
of
her
father
cognizant
of
her
disgrace
had
effected
surely
it
was
a
disgrace
for
a
young
and
guileless
maiden
to
have
to
confess
to
such
an
escapade
an
escapade
that
sounded
worse
to
censuring
ears
than
it
had
been
in
reality
anna
fainted
winthorne
stepped
forward
and
she
was
borne
out
another
quakeress
was
now
put
into
the
and
the
court
looked
upon
a
little
woman
whose
face
was
sallow
and
who
showed
her
defective
teeth
as
she
spoke
it
was
hester
dell
she
wore
a
brown
silk
bonnet
lined
with
white
and
a
shawl
she
was
told
that
she
must
state
what
she
knew
relative
to
the
visit
of
herbert
dare
that
night
i
went
to
rest
at
my
usual
hour
or
maybe
a
trifle
later
for
i
had
waited
for
the
arrival
of
some
physic
never
supposing
but
that
the
child
anna
had
gone
to
her
room
before
me
and
was
safe
in
bed
i
had
been
asleep
some
considerable
time
as
it
seemed
when
i
was
awakened
by
what
sounded
like
the
raising
of
the
kitchen
window
underneath
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
and
was
convinced
that
the
window
was
being
raised
slowly
and
cautiously
as
if
the
raiser
did
not
want
it
to
be
heard
i
was
considerably
startled
the
more
so
as
i
knew
i
had
left
the
window
fastened
and
my
thoughts
turned
to
while
i
deliberated
what
to
do
seeing
i
was
but
a
lone
woman
in
the
house
save
for
the
child
anna
and
patience
who
was
disabled
in
her
bed
i
heard
what
appeared
to
be
the
voice
of
the
child
and
it
sounded
in
the
yard
i
went
to
my
window
but
i
could
not
see
anything
it
being
right
over
the
kitchen
and
i
not
daring
to
open
it
but
i
still
heard
anna
voice
she
was
speaking
in
a
low
tone
and
i
believed
i
caught
other
tones
also
those
of
a
man
i
thought
i
must
be
asleep
and
dreaming
next
i
thought
it
must
be
young
gar
from
the
next
door
jane
halliburton
son
her
other
sons
i
knew
to
be
not
at
home
the
one
being
abroad
the
other
at
the
university
of
oxford
i
deliberated
could
anything
be
the
matter
at
their
house
and
the
boy
have
come
for
help
then
i
reflected
that
that
was
most
unlikely
for
why
should
he
be
stealthily
opening
the
kitchen
window
and
why
should
anna
be
whispering
with
him
in
short
to
tell
thee
the
truth
raising
her
eyes
to
the
judge
whom
she
appeared
to
address
to
the
ignoring
of
everyone
else
i
did
not
know
what
to
think
and
i
grew
more
disturbed
i
quietly
put
on
a
few
things
and
went
softly
down
the
stairs
deeming
it
well
for
my
own
sake
to
feel
my
way
as
it
were
and
not
to
run
headlong
into
danger
i
stood
a
moment
at
the
kitchen
door
listening
and
there
i
distinctly
heard
anna
laugh
a
little
gentle
laugh
it
reassured
me
though
i
was
still
puzzled
and
i
opened
the
door
at
once
here
the
witness
made
a
dead
pause
what
did
you
see
when
you
opened
the
door
asked
the
judge
i
would
not
tell
thee
but
that
i
am
bound
to
tell
thee
she
frankly
answered
i
saw
the
prisoner
herbert
dare
he
appeared
to
have
been
laughing
with
anna
who
stood
near
him
and
he
was
preparing
to
get
out
at
the
window
as
i
entered
well
what
next
inquired
the
counsel
in
an
impatient
tone
for
hester
had
stopped
again
i
can
hardly
tell
what
next
replied
the
witness
looking
back
it
appears
nothing
but
confusion
in
my
mind
it
seemed
nothing
but
confusion
at
the
time
anna
cried
out
and
hid
her
face
in
fear
and
the
prisoner
attempted
some
explanation
which
i
would
not
listen
to
to
see
a
son
of
anthony
dare
in
the
house
with
the
child
at
that
midnight
hour
filled
me
with
anger
and
bewilderment
i
ordered
him
away
i
believe
i
pushed
him
through
the
window
i
threatened
to
call
in
a
policeman
finally
he
went
away
saying
nothing
i
tell
you
all
i
would
not
listen
to
it
i
remembered
scraps
of
what
he
said
afterwards
that
anna
was
not
to
blame
that
i
had
no
cause
to
scold
her
or
to
acquaint
patience
with
what
happened
that
the
fault
if
there
was
any
fault
was
mine
for
locking
the
back
door
so
quickly
i
refused
to
hear
farther
and
he
departed
saying
he
would
explain
when
i
was
less
angry
that
is
all
i
saw
of
him
did
you
mention
this
affair
to
anyone
asked
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
no
why
not
the
child
clung
about
me
in
tears
after
he
was
gone
giving
me
the
explanation
that
i
would
not
hear
from
him
and
beseeching
me
not
to
acquaint
patience
she
told
me
how
it
had
happened
that
upon
my
going
out
to
see
after
the
for
patience
she
had
taken
the
opportunity
to
run
to
the
field
with
a
book
where
herbert
dare
waited
and
that
upon
attempting
to
come
in
again
she
found
the
door
locked
you
returned
sooner
than
she
expected
yes
i
met
the
doctor
boy
near
our
house
bringing
the
physic
and
i
took
it
from
him
and
went
home
again
directly
not
seeing
anna
about
i
never
thought
but
that
she
had
retired
to
bed
i
went
up
also
trying
the
back
door
as
i
passed
it
which
to
my
surprise
i
found
unfastened
why
to
your
surprise
because
i
had
as
i
believed
previously
turned
the
key
of
it
finding
it
unlocked
i
concluded
i
must
have
been
mistaken
afterwards
when
the
explanation
came
i
learnt
that
anna
had
undone
it
she
clung
about
me
as
i
tell
thee
sobbing
and
crying
saying
as
he
had
said
that
there
was
no
cause
to
be
angry
with
her
that
she
could
not
help
what
had
happened
and
that
she
had
sat
crying
on
the
the
whole
of
the
time
until
he
had
effected
an
entrance
for
her
i
went
to
the
pantry
window
and
saw
where
the
wires
had
been
torn
away
not
roughly
but
neatly
and
i
knew
it
must
have
taken
a
long
time
to
accomplish
i
fell
in
with
the
child
prayer
and
did
not
speak
of
what
had
occurred
not
even
to
patience
this
is
the
first
time
it
has
escaped
my
lips
so
you
deemed
it
desirable
to
conceal
such
an
adventure
and
give
the
prisoner
opportunity
to
renew
his
midnight
visits
retorted
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
what
was
done
could
not
be
undone
said
the
witness
i
was
willing
to
spare
the
scandal
to
the
child
and
not
be
the
means
of
spreading
it
abroad
while
i
was
deliberating
whether
to
tell
patience
seeing
she
was
in
so
suffering
a
state
news
came
that
herbert
dare
was
a
prisoner
he
had
been
arrested
the
following
morning
on
the
accusation
of
murdering
his
brother
and
i
knew
that
he
was
safe
for
several
weeks
to
come
hence
i
held
my
tongue
the
witness
had
given
her
evidence
in
a
clear
straightforward
uncompromising
manner
widely
at
variance
with
the
distressed
timidity
of
anna
not
a
shade
of
doubt
rested
on
the
mind
of
any
person
in
court
that
both
had
spoken
the
exact
truth
but
the
counsel
seemed
inclined
to
question
still
since
when
did
you
know
you
were
coming
here
to
give
this
evidence
only
when
i
did
come
richard
winthorne
the
man
of
law
came
to
our
house
in
a
fly
this
afternoon
and
brought
us
away
with
him
by
some
remarks
he
exchanged
with
anna
when
we
were
in
it
i
found
that
she
had
known
of
it
this
day
or
two
they
feared
to
avert
me
i
suppose
lest
maybe
i
might
refuse
to
attend
one
question
more
witness
did
the
prisoner
wear
a
cloak
that
night
no
i
did
not
see
any
this
closed
the
evidence
and
the
witness
was
allowed
to
withdraw
richard
winthorne
went
in
search
of
samuel
lynn
and
found
him
seated
on
a
bench
in
the
outer
hall
surrounded
by
gentlemen
of
his
persuasion
many
of
them
of
high
standing
in
helstonleigh
tales
of
marvel
you
know
never
lose
anything
in
spreading
neither
are
people
given
to
placing
a
light
construction
on
public
gossip
when
they
can
by
any
stretch
of
imagination
give
it
a
dark
one
in
this
affair
however
no
very
great
stretch
was
required
the
town
jumped
to
the
charitable
conclusion
that
anna
lynn
must
be
one
of
the
naughtiest
girls
under
the
sun
imprudent
ungrateful
disobedient
i
do
know
what
else
had
she
been
guilty
of
scattering
poison
in
atterly
field
and
so
killed
all
the
lambs
they
could
not
have
said
or
thought
worse
than
they
did
all
joined
in
it
charitable
and
uncharitable
all
sorts
of
evil
notions
were
spread
and
were
taken
up
herbert
dare
you
may
be
very
sure
came
in
for
share
the
news
had
been
taken
to
ashley
manufactory
sent
by
the
astounded
patience
that
richard
winthorne
had
come
and
taken
away
anna
and
hester
dell
to
give
testimony
at
the
trial
of
herbert
dare
the
quaker
perplexed
and
wondering
believed
patience
must
be
demented
that
the
message
could
have
no
foundation
in
truth
nevertheless
he
bent
his
steps
to
the
guildhall
accompanied
by
william
halliburton
and
was
witness
to
the
evidence
he
strict
and
was
not
likely
to
take
up
a
more
favourable
construction
of
the
general
facts
than
the
town
was
taking
up
it
may
be
guessed
what
it
was
for
him
he
sat
now
on
a
bench
in
the
outer
hall
surrounded
by
friends
who
on
hearing
the
crying
scandal
whispered
touching
a
young
member
of
their
body
had
come
flocking
down
to
the
guildhall
when
they
spoke
to
him
he
did
not
appear
to
hear
he
sat
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
his
head
sunk
on
his
breast
never
raising
it
richard
winthorne
approached
him
miss
lynn
and
her
servant
will
not
be
wanted
again
said
the
lawyer
i
have
sent
for
a
fly
the
fly
came
anna
was
placed
in
it
by
winthorne
hester
dell
followed
and
samuel
lynn
came
forward
and
stumbled
into
it
it
is
the
proper
word
he
appeared
to
have
no
power
left
in
his
limbs
thou
wilt
not
be
harsh
with
her
samuel
whispered
an
influential
friend
who
had
a
benevolent
countenance
some
of
us
will
confer
with
thee
but
meanwhile
do
not
be
harsh
with
her
thou
wilt
call
to
mind
that
she
is
thy
child
and
motherless
samuel
lynn
made
no
reply
he
did
not
appear
to
hear
he
sat
opposite
his
daughter
his
eyes
never
lifted
and
his
face
assuming
a
leaden
hue
hester
suddenly
leaned
from
the
door
and
beckoned
to
william
halliburton
will
thee
please
be
so
obliging
as
go
up
with
us
in
the
fly
she
said
in
his
ear
i
do
not
like
his
look
william
stepped
in
and
the
fly
drove
away
with
closed
blinds
to
the
intense
chagrin
of
the
curious
mob
before
it
was
out
of
the
town
william
and
hester
with
a
simultaneous
movement
supported
the
quaker
anna
screamed
what
is
it
she
uttered
terrified
at
the
sight
of
his
drawn
distorted
face
it
is
thy
work
said
hester
less
placidly
than
she
would
have
spoken
in
a
calmer
moment
if
thee
hast
saved
the
life
of
thy
friend
herbert
dare
thee
hast
probably
destroyed
that
of
thy
father
they
were
close
to
the
residence
of
parry
and
william
ordered
the
fly
to
stop
the
surgeon
was
at
home
and
took
william
place
in
it
samuel
lynn
had
been
struck
down
with
paralysis
william
was
at
the
house
before
they
were
preparing
patience
patience
was
so
far
restored
to
health
herself
as
to
be
able
to
walk
about
a
little
she
was
very
lame
still
they
carried
lynn
to
his
room
anna
in
her
deep
humiliation
and
shame
having
to
give
evidence
and
such
evidence
in
the
face
of
that
open
court
had
been
nothing
less
to
her
flew
to
her
own
chamber
and
flung
herself
dressed
as
she
was
on
the
carpet
in
desperate
abandonment
william
saw
her
there
as
he
passed
it
from
her
room
there
was
no
one
to
attend
to
her
for
they
were
occupied
with
lynn
it
was
no
moment
for
ceremony
and
william
entered
and
attempted
to
raise
her
let
me
be
william
let
me
be
i
only
want
to
die
anna
child
this
will
not
mend
the
past
do
not
give
way
like
this
but
she
resolutely
turned
from
him
sobbing
more
wildly
only
to
die
only
to
die
william
went
for
his
mother
and
gave
her
the
outline
of
the
tale
asking
her
to
go
to
the
house
of
distress
and
see
what
could
be
done
jane
in
utter
astonishment
sought
further
explanation
she
could
not
understand
him
in
the
least
i
assure
you
i
understand
it
nearly
as
little
replied
william
anna
was
locked
out
through
some
mistake
of
hester
it
appears
and
herbert
dare
stayed
with
her
that
it
will
be
the
means
of
acquitting
him
there
is
no
doubt
but
helstonleigh
is
making
its
comments
very
freely
jane
went
in
her
senses
bewildered
she
found
patience
in
a
state
not
to
be
described
she
found
anna
where
william
had
left
her
reiterating
the
same
cry
oh
that
i
were
dead
that
i
were
dead
meanwhile
the
trial
at
the
guildhall
was
drawing
to
its
close
and
the
judge
proceeded
to
sum
up
not
with
the
frantic
bursts
of
oratory
indulged
in
by
those
eloquent
gentlemen
the
counsel
but
in
a
tone
of
dispassionate
reasoning
he
placed
the
facts
concisely
before
the
jury
not
speaking
in
favour
of
the
prisoner
but
candidly
avowing
that
he
did
not
see
how
they
could
get
over
the
evidence
of
the
prisoner
two
witnesses
the
young
quaker
lady
and
her
maid
if
that
was
to
be
believed
and
for
himself
he
fully
believed
it
then
the
prisoner
could
not
have
been
guilty
of
the
murder
and
was
clearly
entitled
to
an
acquittal
it
was
six
when
the
jury
retired
to
deliberate
the
judge
the
bar
the
spectators
sat
on
or
stood
with
what
patience
they
might
in
the
crowded
and
heated
court
on
the
fiat
of
those
twelve
men
hung
the
life
of
the
prisoner
whether
he
was
to
be
discharged
an
innocent
man
or
hanged
as
a
guilty
one
reposing
in
the
pocket
of
sir
william
leader
was
a
certain
little
cap
black
in
colour
innocuous
in
itself
but
of
awful
significance
when
brought
forth
by
the
hand
of
the
presiding
judge
was
it
destined
to
be
brought
forth
that
night
the
jury
were
coming
in
at
last
only
an
hour
had
they
remained
in
deliberation
for
seven
was
booming
out
over
the
town
it
had
seemed
to
the
impatient
spectators
more
than
two
hours
what
must
it
have
seemed
to
the
prisoner
they
ranged
themselves
in
their
box
and
the
crier
proclaimed
silence
have
you
agreed
upon
your
verdict
gentlemen
of
the
jury
we
have
how
say
you
gentlemen
guilty
or
not
guilty
the
foreman
advanced
an
imperceptible
step
and
looked
at
the
judge
speaking
deliberately
my
lord
we
find
the
prisoner
not
guilty
chapter
xii
a
couch
of
pain
william
i
have
had
my
i
have
had
my
the
speaker
was
henry
ashley
four
days
had
elapsed
since
the
trial
of
herbert
dare
and
william
halliburton
saw
him
now
for
the
first
time
after
that
event
what
with
mind
and
body
henry
was
in
a
grievous
state
of
pain
all
william
compassion
was
called
forth
as
he
leaned
over
his
couch
it
has
been
hinted
that
helstonleigh
in
its
charity
took
up
the
very
worst
view
of
the
case
that
could
be
taken
up
with
regard
to
anna
lynn
had
she
gone
about
with
a
blazing
torch
and
set
all
the
houses
on
fire
their
inhabitants
could
not
have
mounted
themselves
on
higher
stilts
somehow
took
it
up
it
was
like
those
apparently
political
reports
that
arrive
now
and
then
by
telegram
driving
the
stock
exchange
or
the
paris
bourse
into
a
state
of
mad
credulity
no
one
to
doubt
it
people
caught
up
the
notion
from
one
another
as
they
catch
a
fever
if
even
samuel
lynn
had
looked
upon
it
in
the
worst
light
bringing
to
him
paralysis
little
chance
was
there
that
others
might
gaze
through
a
brighter
glass
it
had
half
killed
henry
ashley
and
the
words
were
not
in
point
of
fact
so
wild
as
they
sounded
i
have
had
my
i
have
had
my
no
you
have
not
was
william
answer
it
is
a
blow
i
know
it
but
not
one
that
you
can
not
outlive
why
did
you
not
come
to
me
four
whole
days
and
you
have
never
been
near
the
house
because
i
feared
that
you
would
be
throwing
yourself
into
the
state
of
agitation
that
you
are
now
doing
replied
william
candidly
ashley
said
to
me
on
the
wednesday
has
one
of
his
bad
attacks
again
i
knew
it
to
be
more
of
mind
than
body
this
time
and
i
thought
it
well
that
you
should
be
left
in
quiet
there
no
one
you
can
talk
about
it
to
except
me
your
staying
away
has
not
served
your
purpose
then
my
father
came
to
me
with
the
details
thinking
to
divert
me
for
a
moment
from
my
physical
pain
never
supposing
that
each
word
was
a
dagger
plunged
into
my
very
being
my
mother
came
with
this
scrap
of
news
or
the
other
scrap
mary
came
wondering
and
eager
asking
information
at
mamma
was
mysterious
over
it
and
would
not
tell
her
mary
can
not
credit
ill
of
anna
she
has
as
great
a
trust
in
her
still
as
i
had
as
i
had
oh
william
she
was
my
object
in
life
she
was
all
my
future
my
world
my
heaven
now
you
know
you
will
suffer
for
this
excitement
cried
william
almost
as
he
would
have
said
it
to
a
wayward
child
he
might
as
well
have
talked
to
the
wind
henry
neither
heard
nor
heeded
him
he
continued
his
manner
as
full
of
agitation
as
his
mind
i
am
not
as
other
men
you
can
go
forth
all
of
you
into
the
world
to
your
pleasures
your
amusements
i
am
confined
here
but
what
mattered
it
did
i
envy
you
no
while
i
had
her
to
think
of
i
was
happier
than
you
had
this
not
happened
you
might
have
been
crossed
in
some
other
way
and
so
it
would
have
come
to
the
same
thing
and
now
it
is
over
reiterated
henry
paying
no
attention
to
the
remark
it
is
over
and
gone
and
i
i
wish
william
i
had
gone
with
it
i
wish
you
would
be
reasonable
do
preach
you
active
men
with
your
innumerable
objects
and
interests
in
life
can
not
know
what
it
is
for
one
like
me
shut
out
from
the
world
to
i
tell
you
william
it
was
literally
my
life
the
core
of
my
life
my
all
i
am
not
sure
but
that
i
have
been
mad
ever
since
i
am
not
sure
but
that
you
are
mad
now
returned
william
believing
that
to
humour
him
might
be
the
worst
plan
he
could
adopt
i
dare
say
i
am
was
the
unsatisfactory
answer
four
days
and
i
have
had
to
bury
it
all
within
me
i
could
not
wail
it
out
to
my
own
pillow
at
night
for
they
concluded
it
was
one
of
my
bad
attacks
and
old
nurse
was
posted
in
the
bed
in
the
next
room
with
the
door
open
there
no
one
i
can
rave
to
but
you
and
you
must
let
me
do
it
unless
you
would
have
me
go
quite
mad
i
hope
i
sha
be
here
long
to
be
a
trouble
to
any
of
you
william
did
not
know
what
to
say
he
believed
there
was
nothing
for
it
at
present
but
to
let
him
rave
himself
out
but
i
wish
he
said
aloud
continuing
the
bent
of
his
own
thoughts
that
you
would
be
a
little
rational
over
it
stop
a
bit
did
you
ever
experience
a
blow
such
as
this
no
indeed
then
do
hold
forth
to
me
i
say
you
do
not
understand
it
was
all
the
joy
i
had
on
earth
you
must
learn
to
find
other
joys
other
the
despicable
villain
broke
forth
henry
the
welling
to
his
brow
as
they
had
welled
to
anna
when
before
the
judge
the
cowardly
villain
was
she
not
samuel
lynn
child
and
my
sister
friend
what
possessed
the
jury
to
acquit
him
did
they
think
a
too
good
for
his
neck
he
was
proved
innocent
of
the
murder
if
he
has
any
conscience
what
fiercely
interrupted
henry
ashley
a
conscience
i
know
what
you
are
dreaming
of
is
he
going
to
stop
in
helstonleigh
i
conclude
so
he
resumed
his
place
quietly
in
his
father
office
the
day
after
the
trial
he
is
in
london
now
but
only
temporarily
resumed
his
place
quietly
what
was
the
mob
about
then
the
question
was
put
so
quaintly
in
such
confiding
simplicity
that
a
smile
rose
to
william
face
in
awe
of
the
police
i
expect
he
answered
the
dares
while
his
fate
was
uncertain
have
been
rusticating
cyril
told
me
that
now
that
the
accusation
was
proved
to
have
been
false
they
were
out
again
coming
out
in
what
villainy
he
left
the
to
be
inferred
in
grandeur
i
expect
the
established
innocence
of
herbert
if
you
apply
that
word
to
the
man
william
halliburton
you
are
as
black
as
he
is
william
remembered
henry
tribulation
both
of
mind
and
body
and
went
on
without
the
shadow
of
a
retort
i
apply
it
to
him
in
relation
to
the
crime
of
which
he
was
charged
his
acquittal
and
release
have
caused
the
dares
to
hold
up
their
heads
again
but
they
have
lost
caste
in
helstonleigh
caste
was
the
scornful
ejaculation
of
henry
ashley
they
never
had
any
caste
to
lose
does
the
master
intend
to
retain
cyril
in
the
manufactory
i
have
heard
nothing
to
the
contrary
if
he
retained
him
whilst
the
accusation
was
hanging
over
herbert
dare
head
he
will
not
be
likely
to
discard
him
now
it
is
removed
removed
shrieked
henry
if
one
accusation
has
been
removed
has
not
a
worse
taken
its
place
would
it
be
just
to
visit
on
one
brother
the
sins
of
another
a
nice
pair
of
brothers
they
are
cried
henry
in
the
sharp
petulant
manner
habitual
to
him
when
racked
with
pain
how
will
samuel
lynn
like
the
company
of
cyril
dare
by
his
side
in
the
manufactory
when
he
gets
well
again
william
shook
his
head
these
considerations
were
not
for
him
they
were
ashley
you
heard
her
give
her
evidence
resumed
henry
breaking
a
pause
most
of
it
tell
it
me
no
henry
it
would
not
do
you
good
to
hear
it
tell
it
me
i
say
persisted
henry
wilfully
i
know
it
in
substance
i
want
to
have
it
repeated
over
to
me
word
for
word
but
henry
suddenly
raised
his
hand
and
laid
it
on
william
lips
with
a
warning
movement
he
turned
and
saw
mary
ashley
take
her
back
to
the
william
he
whispered
i
can
bear
no
one
but
you
about
me
now
not
yet
mary
he
added
aloud
motioning
his
sister
away
with
his
hand
not
now
mary
halted
in
indecision
william
advanced
placed
her
hand
within
his
arm
and
led
her
somewhat
summarily
from
the
room
i
am
only
obeying
orders
miss
ashley
said
he
they
are
to
see
you
back
to
the
if
henry
can
bear
you
with
him
he
might
bear
me
you
know
what
his
whims
and
fancies
are
when
he
is
suffering
is
there
not
a
particularly
good
understanding
between
you
and
henry
she
pointedly
asked
yes
we
understand
each
other
perfectly
well
then
tell
me
what
is
it
that
is
the
matter
with
him
this
time
i
do
not
like
to
say
so
to
mamma
because
she
might
call
me
fanciful
but
it
appears
to
me
that
henry
illness
is
more
on
the
mind
than
on
the
body
william
made
no
reply
and
yet
i
can
not
imagine
it
possible
for
henry
to
have
picked
up
any
annoyance
or
grief
resumed
mary
how
can
he
have
done
so
he
is
not
like
one
who
goes
out
into
the
world
who
has
to
meet
with
cares
and
cheeks
you
do
not
speak
she
added
looking
at
william
is
it
that
you
will
not
tell
me
or
do
you
know
nothing
william
lowered
his
voice
i
can
only
say
that
should
there
be
anything
of
the
sort
you
mention
the
kinder
course
for
henry
indeed
the
only
course
will
be
not
to
allow
him
to
perceive
that
you
suspect
it
conceal
the
suspicion
both
from
him
and
from
others
remember
his
excessive
sensitiveness
when
he
sees
cause
to
hide
his
feelings
it
would
be
almost
death
to
him
to
have
them
scrutinized
i
think
you
must
be
in
his
full
confidence
observed
mary
looking
at
william
pretty
well
so
he
answered
with
a
passing
smile
then
if
he
has
any
secret
grief
will
you
try
and
soothe
it
to
him
with
all
my
best
endeavours
earnestly
spoke
william
but
there
was
not
the
least
apparent
necessity
for
his
taking
mary
ashley
hand
between
his
own
and
pressing
it
there
while
he
said
it
any
more
than
there
was
necessity
for
that
vivid
blush
of
hers
as
she
turned
into
the
but
you
must
be
anxious
to
hear
of
anna
lynn
poor
anna
who
had
fallen
so
terribly
into
the
black
books
of
the
town
without
really
very
much
deserving
it
it
was
a
most
unlucky
having
been
locked
out
it
was
a
still
more
unfortunate
sequel
having
to
confess
to
it
at
the
trial
she
was
not
a
pattern
of
goodness
it
must
be
confessed
had
not
yet
attained
to
that
perfect
model
which
expects
as
of
a
right
a
niche
in
the
saintly
calendar
she
was
reprehensibly
vain
she
delighted
in
plaguing
patience
and
she
took
to
running
out
into
the
field
when
it
had
been
far
better
that
she
had
remained
at
home
that
running
out
entailed
deceit
and
some
stories
but
it
entailed
nothing
worse
and
helstonleigh
need
not
have
been
so
very
severe
in
its
judgment
never
had
there
been
a
more
forcible
illustration
of
the
old
saying
give
a
dog
a
bad
name
and
hang
him
than
in
this
instance
when
william
halliburton
had
told
anna
that
herbert
dare
was
not
a
good
man
and
did
not
bear
a
good
name
he
had
told
her
the
strict
truth
for
that
very
reason
a
secret
intimacy
with
him
was
undesirable
however
innocent
it
might
be
however
innocent
it
in
itself
and
for
that
very
reason
did
helstonleigh
look
at
it
through
clouded
spectacles
had
she
been
locked
out
all
night
instead
of
half
a
one
with
some
one
in
better
odour
helstonleigh
had
not
set
up
its
scornful
crest
it
is
quite
impossible
to
tell
you
what
herbert
dare
had
done
to
have
such
a
burden
on
his
back
as
people
seemed
inclined
to
lay
there
perhaps
they
did
not
know
themselves
some
accused
him
of
one
thing
some
of
another
ill
reports
never
lose
by
carrying
the
two
cats
on
the
tiles
you
know
were
magnified
into
a
hundred
no
one
is
as
black
as
he
is
painted
there
a
saying
to
that
effect
neither
i
dare
say
was
herbert
dare
at
any
rate
and
that
is
what
we
have
to
do
with
he
was
not
so
in
this
particular
instance
he
was
as
vexed
at
the
locking
out
as
any
one
else
could
have
been
and
he
did
the
best
save
one
thing
that
he
could
for
anna
under
the
circumstances
and
got
her
in
again
the
only
proper
thing
to
have
done
was
to
knock
up
hester
he
had
wished
to
do
it
but
had
yielded
to
anna
entreaties
that
were
born
of
fear
not
a
soul
seemed
to
cast
so
much
as
a
good
word
or
a
charitable
thought
to
him
in
the
matter
did
he
deserve
none
however
thoughtless
or
reprehensible
his
conduct
was
in
drawing
anna
into
those
field
excursions
when
the
explosion
came
he
met
it
as
a
gentleman
many
a
one
more
renowned
for
the
cardinal
graces
than
was
herbert
dare
might
have
spoken
out
at
once
and
cleared
himself
at
the
expense
of
making
known
anna
unlucky
escapade
not
so
he
a
doubt
may
have
been
upon
him
that
were
it
betrayed
helstonleigh
might
cast
a
taint
on
her
fair
name
and
he
strove
to
save
it
he
suffered
the
brand
of
a
murderer
to
be
attached
to
him
he
languished
for
many
weeks
in
prison
as
a
criminal
all
to
save
it
he
all
but
went
to
the
scaffold
to
save
it
he
might
have
called
anna
and
hester
dell
forward
at
the
inquest
at
the
preliminary
examination
before
the
magistrates
and
thus
have
cleared
himself
but
he
would
not
do
so
whilst
there
was
a
chance
of
his
innocence
being
brought
to
light
in
any
other
manner
he
would
not
call
on
anna
he
allowed
the
odium
to
settle
upon
his
own
head
he
went
to
prison
hoping
that
he
should
be
cleared
in
some
other
way
there
was
a
generous
chivalric
feeling
in
this
which
helstonleigh
could
not
understand
when
emanating
from
herbert
dare
and
they
declined
to
give
him
credit
for
it
they
preferred
to
look
at
the
affair
altogether
in
a
different
light
and
to
lavish
hard
names
upon
it
every
soul
was
alike
there
was
no
exception
samuel
lynn
and
all
else
in
helstonleigh
they
caught
the
epidemic
i
say
one
from
another
chapter
xiii
a
ray
of
light
the
first
sharpness
of
the
edge
worn
off
anna
grew
cross
she
did
not
see
why
every
one
should
be
blaming
her
what
had
so
sadly
prostrated
herself
was
the
shame
of
having
to
appear
before
the
court
to
stand
in
it
and
give
her
evidence
the
excitement
the
shame
combined
with
the
terrifying
illness
of
her
father
brought
on
as
hester
told
her
through
her
had
sent
her
into
a
wild
state
of
contrition
and
alarm
little
wonder
that
she
wished
herself
dead
the
mood
passed
away
as
the
days
went
on
and
anna
became
tolerably
herself
again
when
friends
called
at
the
house
to
inquire
after
or
to
see
her
father
she
ran
and
hid
herself
in
her
room
fearful
lest
a
lecture
on
those
field
recreations
might
be
delivered
to
her
gratuitously
she
shunned
patience
too
as
much
as
she
could
patience
had
grown
cold
and
silent
and
anna
rather
liked
the
change
she
sat
for
the
most
part
in
her
father
room
never
moving
from
his
bedside
unless
disturbed
from
it
never
speaking
eating
only
when
food
was
placed
before
her
anna
was
in
grievous
fear
lest
a
public
reprimand
should
be
in
store
for
her
delivered
at
meeting
on
first
day
but
she
saw
no
reason
why
every
one
should
continue
to
be
cross
with
her
at
home
she
happened
to
be
alone
with
her
father
when
he
first
recovered
consciousness
some
fifteen
days
had
elapsed
since
the
trial
but
for
the
fact
of
her
being
with
him
a
difficulty
might
have
been
experienced
to
get
her
there
she
dreaded
his
anger
his
reproach
more
than
anything
so
long
as
he
lay
without
his
senses
knowing
her
not
so
long
was
she
content
to
sit
watching
she
was
seated
by
the
bedside
in
her
usual
listless
attitude
head
and
eyes
cast
down
when
her
hand
not
the
one
affected
was
suddenly
lifted
and
laid
upon
hers
which
rested
on
the
counterpane
startled
anna
turned
her
gaze
upon
him
and
she
saw
that
his
intellects
were
restored
with
a
suppressed
cry
of
dismay
she
would
have
flown
away
but
he
clasped
his
fingers
round
hers
anna
she
sank
down
on
her
knees
shaking
as
if
with
ague
and
buried
her
face
in
the
clothes
samuel
lynn
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
put
it
on
her
head
thou
art
my
own
child
anna
thy
mother
left
thee
to
me
for
good
and
for
ill
and
i
will
stand
by
thee
in
thy
sorrow
she
burst
into
a
storm
of
hysterical
tears
he
let
it
have
its
course
he
drew
her
wet
face
to
his
and
kissed
it
he
talked
to
her
soothingly
never
speaking
a
single
word
of
reproach
and
anna
overcame
her
fear
and
her
sobs
she
knelt
down
by
the
bed
still
and
let
her
cheek
rest
on
the
counterpane
it
has
nearly
killed
me
he
murmured
after
a
while
but
i
pray
for
life
i
will
struggle
hard
to
live
that
thee
mayst
have
one
protector
friends
and
foes
may
cast
reproach
to
thee
but
i
will
not
why
should
cast
reproach
to
me
father
returned
anna
with
a
little
spice
of
resentment
i
have
not
harmed
them
no
child
thee
hast
not
only
thyself
i
will
help
thee
to
bear
the
reproach
thou
art
my
own
child
but
there
nothing
for
to
reproach
me
with
she
reiterated
her
face
buried
deeper
in
the
counterpane
it
was
not
pleasant
to
stand
there
but
it
is
over
and
they
need
not
reflect
upon
me
for
it
what
is
over
to
stand
where
he
asked
at
the
guildhall
on
the
trial
it
is
not
that
people
will
reproach
thee
with
anna
it
was
not
a
nice
thing
for
thee
but
that
in
itself
brings
no
reproach
anna
lifted
her
head
wonderingly
what
does
then
she
uttered
he
did
not
answer
he
only
closed
his
eyes
a
deep
groan
bursting
from
the
very
depths
of
his
heart
it
came
into
anna
mind
that
he
must
be
thinking
of
her
previous
acquaintance
with
herbert
dare
of
her
stolen
meetings
in
the
field
by
twilight
oh
father
do
thee
be
angry
with
me
she
implored
the
tears
streaming
from
her
eyes
it
was
no
harm
it
was
not
indeed
thee
mightst
have
been
present
always
for
all
the
harm
there
was
and
i
wish
thee
hadst
been
why
should
thee
think
anger
of
it
there
was
no
more
harm
in
my
talking
with
him
now
and
then
in
the
field
than
there
was
in
my
talking
with
him
in
margaret
ashley
something
in
the
simple
words
in
the
tone
in
the
manner
altogether
caused
the
quaker
heart
to
leap
within
him
had
he
been
making
a
molehill
into
a
mountain
surely
yes
but
what
else
he
would
have
said
or
done
what
questions
asked
can
not
be
known
for
they
were
interrupted
by
a
visit
from
william
halliburton
anna
stole
away
william
was
full
of
hearty
congratulation
on
the
visible
improvement
the
so
far
restoration
to
health
the
quaker
murmured
some
words
indicating
something
to
the
effect
that
he
might
not
have
been
ill
but
for
taking
up
a
worse
view
of
the
case
than
as
he
believed
now
it
really
merited
william
leaned
over
him
a
glad
look
in
his
eye
a
glad
sound
in
his
low
voice
my
mother
has
been
telling
patience
so
she
my
mother
is
convinced
now
that
very
exaggerated
blame
was
cast
upon
anna
it
was
foolish
of
her
of
course
to
fall
into
the
habit
of
running
to
the
field
but
the
locking
out
might
have
happened
to
anyone
my
mother
told
me
this
not
half
an
hour
ago
she
has
seen
and
talked
to
anna
frequently
this
last
day
or
two
and
has
drawn
her
own
positive
deductions
my
mother
is
vexed
with
herself
for
having
fallen
into
the
popular
condemnation
ay
uttered
samuel
lynn
there
condemnation
abroad
then
i
thought
there
was
people
will
come
to
their
senses
in
good
time
was
william
answer
never
doubt
it
the
quaker
raised
his
feeble
hand
and
laid
it
upon
william
the
ashleys
have
blamed
her
i
fear
they
have
was
the
only
reply
he
could
make
in
his
strict
truth
then
william
thee
go
to
them
go
to
them
now
and
set
them
right
he
was
already
going
for
he
was
engaged
to
the
ashleys
that
evening
between
henry
ashley
the
men
at
east
and
his
own
studies
which
he
would
not
wholly
neglect
william
evenings
had
a
tolerably
busy
time
of
it
he
had
assumed
samuel
lynn
place
in
the
manufactory
by
ashley
orders
head
of
all
things
under
the
master
cyril
ground
his
teeth
at
this
he
looked
upon
it
as
a
slight
to
himself
but
cyril
had
no
power
to
alter
it
william
found
and
ashley
alone
mary
was
out
he
sat
with
them
for
a
few
minutes
talking
of
anna
and
then
rose
to
go
to
henry
how
is
he
this
evening
he
inquired
ill
and
very
fractious
was
ashley
reply
william
you
have
great
influence
over
him
i
wish
you
could
persuade
him
to
less
he
is
not
ill
enough
so
far
as
we
can
see
to
keep
his
room
but
we
can
not
get
him
out
of
it
henry
was
in
one
of
his
depressed
moods
excessively
dispirited
and
irritable
oh
so
you
have
come
he
burst
forth
as
william
entered
i
should
be
ashamed
to
neglect
a
sick
fellow
as
you
neglect
me
if
i
were
well
and
strong
and
you
ill
you
would
find
it
different
i
know
i
am
late
acknowledged
william
samuel
lynn
took
up
a
little
of
my
time
and
i
have
been
sitting
some
minutes
in
the
of
course
was
the
fractious
answer
any
one
before
me
samuel
lynn
is
a
great
deal
better
continued
william
his
mind
is
restored
henry
received
the
news
ungraciously
making
no
rejoinder
but
his
side
was
twitching
with
pain
how
is
he
asked
is
the
shame
fretting
out
her
life
not
at
all
she
is
very
well
as
to
shame
as
you
call
it
i
believe
she
has
not
taken
much
to
herself
it
will
kill
her
you
see
the
sooner
the
better
for
her
i
should
say
william
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
sofa
on
which
the
invalid
was
lying
henry
i
would
set
you
right
upon
a
point
if
i
thought
it
would
be
expedient
to
do
so
you
do
go
into
fits
of
excitement
so
great
that
it
is
dangerous
to
speak
tell
out
anything
you
have
to
tell
tell
me
if
you
choose
that
the
house
is
on
fire
and
i
must
be
pitched
out
of
window
to
escape
it
it
would
make
no
impression
upon
me
my
fits
of
excitement
have
passed
away
with
anna
lynn
my
news
relates
to
anna
what
if
it
does
she
has
passed
away
helstonleigh
in
its
usual
hasty
fashion
of
jumping
to
conclusions
has
jumped
to
a
false
one
continued
william
there
have
been
no
grounds
for
the
great
blame
cast
to
anna
except
in
the
minds
of
a
charitable
public
a
fact
asked
henry
after
a
pause
there
not
a
shade
of
doubt
about
it
he
received
the
answer
with
equanimity
it
may
be
said
with
apathy
and
turning
on
his
couch
he
drew
the
cover
over
him
repeating
the
words
previously
spoken
she
has
passed
away
for
me
chapter
xiv
mr
delves
on
his
beam
ends
samuel
lynn
grew
better
and
ashley
in
his
considerate
kindness
proposed
that
he
should
reside
abroad
for
a
few
months
in
the
neighbourhood
of
annonay
to
watch
the
skin
market
and
pick
up
skins
that
would
be
suitable
for
their
use
anna
and
patience
were
to
accompany
him
anna
had
somewhat
regained
her
footing
in
the
good
graces
of
the
gossipers
that
she
did
so
was
partly
owing
to
the
indignant
defence
of
her
entered
upon
by
herbert
dare
herbert
did
behave
well
in
this
case
and
he
must
have
his
due
upon
his
return
from
london
whither
he
had
gone
soon
after
the
termination
of
the
trial
remaining
away
a
week
or
two
he
found
what
a
very
charitable
ovation
helstonleigh
was
bestowing
upon
anna
lynn
he
met
it
with
a
storm
of
indignation
he
bade
them
think
as
badly
of
him
as
they
chose
believe
him
a
second
burke
if
they
liked
but
to
keep
their
mistaken
tongues
off
anna
what
with
one
thing
and
another
some
of
the
did
begin
to
think
they
had
been
too
hasty
and
withdrew
their
censure
some
as
a
matter
of
course
preferred
to
doubt
still
and
opinions
remained
divided
helstonleigh
took
up
the
gossip
on
another
score
that
of
sending
samuel
lynn
abroad
as
his
for
an
indefinite
period
a
famous
trade
ashley
must
be
doing
to
go
to
that
expense
grumbled
some
of
the
envious
manufacturers
true
he
a
famous
trade
and
if
he
had
not
had
one
he
might
have
sent
him
all
the
same
helstonleigh
never
knew
the
benevolence
of
thomas
ashley
heart
the
journey
was
fully
decided
upon
and
samuel
lynn
had
an
application
from
a
member
of
his
own
persuasion
to
rent
his
house
furnished
for
the
term
of
his
absence
he
was
glad
to
accept
the
accommodation
but
before
lynn
and
his
family
started
helstonleigh
was
fated
to
sustain
another
loss
in
the
person
of
herbert
dare
herbert
contrived
to
get
some
sort
of
mission
entrusted
to
abroad
and
made
rather
a
summary
exit
from
helstonleigh
to
enter
upon
it
a
friend
of
herbert
who
had
gone
over
to
live
in
holland
and
with
whom
he
was
in
frequent
correspondence
wrote
and
offered
him
a
situation
in
a
merchant
house
in
rotterdam
as
english
clerk
the
offer
came
in
answer
to
a
hint
or
perhaps
more
than
a
hint
from
herbert
that
a
year
or
two
sojourn
abroad
would
be
acceptable
to
him
he
would
receive
a
good
salary
if
he
proved
himself
equal
to
the
duties
the
information
stated
and
might
rise
in
it
if
he
chose
to
remain
herbert
wrote
to
secure
it
and
then
told
his
father
what
he
had
done
enter
a
house
at
rotterdam
as
english
clerk
repeated
dare
unable
to
credit
his
own
ears
a
clerk
what
am
i
to
do
asked
herbert
since
i
came
out
of
there
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
county
prison
claims
have
thickened
upon
me
i
do
owe
a
good
deal
and
that
a
fact
what
with
my
own
scores
and
that
for
which
i
am
liable
for
for
poor
anthony
people
wo
wait
much
longer
and
i
have
no
fancy
to
try
the
debtor
side
of
the
prison
they
were
standing
in
the
front
room
of
the
office
dare
business
appeared
to
be
considerably
falling
off
and
the
office
had
often
leisure
on
its
hands
now
of
the
two
clerks
kept
one
had
holiday
the
other
was
out
somehow
what
with
one
untoward
thing
and
another
people
were
growing
shy
of
the
dares
dare
leaned
against
the
corner
of
the
watching
the
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
a
blank
look
on
his
face
you
say
you
ca
help
me
sir
herbert
continued
you
know
i
ca
sufficiently
to
do
any
good
returned
dare
i
am
too
much
pressed
for
money
myself
look
at
the
expenses
attending
the
trial
and
i
was
embarrassed
enough
before
i
help
you
it
seems
to
me
too
that
you
want
me
gone
from
here
i
have
not
said
so
curtly
responded
dare
you
told
me
the
other
day
that
it
was
my
presence
in
the
office
which
scared
clients
from
it
dare
could
not
deny
the
fact
he
said
it
what
more
he
had
thought
it
and
did
so
still
i
can
not
tell
what
else
it
is
that
is
keeping
clients
away
he
rejoined
we
have
not
had
a
dozen
in
since
the
trial
it
is
a
slack
season
of
the
year
maybe
shortly
answered
dare
slack
as
it
is
there
some
business
astir
but
people
are
going
elsewhere
to
get
it
done
those
too
who
have
never
for
years
been
near
anyone
but
us
the
truth
is
herbert
you
fell
into
bad
odour
with
the
town
on
the
day
of
the
trial
and
that
you
must
know
though
acquitted
of
the
murder
all
sorts
of
other
things
were
laid
to
your
charge
quaker
lynn
stroke
amongst
the
rest
carping
sinners
ejaculated
herbert
and
i
suppose
it
turned
people
against
the
office
continued
dare
my
belief
is
they
wo
come
back
again
as
long
as
you
are
in
it
that
precisely
what
i
meant
you
had
hinted
to
me
said
herbert
therefore
i
thought
i
had
better
leave
it
pattison
says
he
can
get
me
this
berth
and
i
should
like
to
try
it
not
like
to
turn
merchant
clerk
repeated
dare
with
emphasis
i
shall
like
it
better
than
being
nailed
for
debt
here
somewhat
coarsely
answered
herbert
it
is
not
so
agreeable
at
home
now
especially
in
this
office
that
i
should
cry
to
stay
in
it
you
have
changed
sir
amongst
the
rest
many
a
day
through
you
do
give
me
a
civil
word
again
dare
felt
that
he
changed
to
herbert
when
he
found
that
he
herbert
might
have
cleared
himself
at
first
from
the
terrible
accusation
of
fratricide
had
he
so
chosen
instead
of
allowing
the
obloquy
to
rest
upon
himself
and
his
family
for
so
long
a
period
he
had
become
bitterly
angry
dare
and
the
whole
family
joined
in
the
feeling
and
herbert
suffered
as
to
civility
herbert
i
must
first
get
over
the
soreness
left
by
your
conduct
you
acted
very
badly
in
allowing
the
case
to
go
on
to
trial
if
you
had
no
objection
to
sit
down
quietly
under
the
crime
yourself
you
had
no
right
to
throw
the
disgrace
and
expense
upon
your
family
if
it
were
to
come
over
again
i
would
not
do
so
acknowledged
herbert
i
thought
then
i
was
acting
for
the
best
pshaw
was
the
peevish
ejaculation
of
dare
altogether
resumed
herbert
i
think
i
had
better
go
away
after
a
time
something
or
other
may
turn
up
to
make
things
smoother
here
and
then
i
can
come
home
again
unless
i
find
a
better
opening
abroad
i
may
do
so
and
i
believe
i
shall
like
living
there
very
well
said
dare
after
some
minutes
silence
it
may
be
for
the
best
at
all
events
it
will
give
time
for
things
here
to
blow
over
if
you
do
find
it
what
you
like
you
can
only
return
i
shall
be
sure
not
to
return
unless
i
can
square
up
some
of
my
liabilities
here
returned
herbert
you
must
help
me
to
get
there
sir
what
do
you
want
asked
dare
fifty
pounds
i
ca
do
it
herbert
was
the
prompt
answer
i
must
have
it
if
i
am
to
go
was
herbert
firm
reply
there
are
two
or
three
trifles
here
which
i
will
not
leave
unsettled
and
i
can
not
go
over
there
with
pockets
absolutely
empty
fifty
pounds
is
not
so
great
a
sum
sir
to
pay
to
get
rid
of
me
old
anthony
dare
knit
his
brow
in
perplexity
he
supposed
he
must
furnish
the
money
though
he
did
not
in
the
least
see
how
it
was
to
be
done
the
matter
settled
herbert
took
his
hat
and
went
out
the
first
object
his
eyes
alighted
on
outside
was
sergeant
delves
that
worthy
pacing
through
the
town
had
brought
himself
to
an
anchor
opposite
the
office
of
dare
and
was
regarding
it
lost
in
a
brown
study
the
sergeant
was
in
a
state
of
discomfiture
touching
the
affair
of
the
late
anthony
dare
he
had
lost
no
time
in
looking
after
miss
caroline
mason
as
he
had
promised
himself
and
the
sequence
had
been
defeat
without
any
open
stir
on
the
part
of
the
police
without
allowing
caroline
herself
to
know
that
she
was
doubted
the
sergeant
contrived
to
put
himself
in
full
possession
of
her
movements
on
that
night
the
result
proved
that
she
must
be
exempt
from
the
suspicion
or
as
the
sergeant
expressed
it
was
out
of
the
hole
and
that
gentleman
remained
at
fault
again
herbert
crossed
over
to
him
what
are
you
looking
at
delves
i
was
looking
at
anything
in
particular
was
the
answer
coming
in
sight
of
your
office
naturally
brought
my
thoughts
back
to
that
unsatisfactory
business
i
never
was
so
baffled
before
it
is
very
strange
who
it
could
have
been
observed
herbert
i
often
think
of
it
never
so
baffled
before
continued
the
sergeant
as
if
there
had
been
no
interruption
to
his
own
words
i
could
almost
have
been
upon
oath
at
the
time
that
the
murderer
was
in
the
house
had
left
it
and
yet
you
could
have
been
upon
oath
that
it
was
i
interrupted
herbert
that
true
i
could
but
you
had
yourself
chiefly
to
thank
for
it
herbert
dare
through
making
a
mystery
of
your
movements
that
night
after
you
were
cleared
my
mind
turned
to
that
girl
and
that
i
found
was
no
go
what
girl
interrupted
herbert
the
one
in
honey
fair
your
brother
anthony
old
sweetheart
it
her
though
i
have
proofs
charlotte
east
had
her
at
her
house
that
evening
and
kept
her
till
twelve
when
she
went
home
to
bed
in
her
garret
charlotte
going
to
try
to
make
something
of
her
again
and
now
i
am
baffled
and
i
do
deny
it
to
suspect
any
girl
is
ridiculous
observed
herbert
dare
no
girl
it
is
to
be
hoped
would
possess
the
courage
or
the
strength
to
accomplish
such
a
deed
as
that
you
do
know
as
we
police
do
nodded
the
sergeant
i
was
asking
your
father
only
a
day
or
two
ago
whether
he
could
make
sure
of
his
servants
that
they
had
not
been
in
it
of
our
servants
interrupted
herbert
in
surprise
what
an
idea
well
i
have
gone
round
to
my
old
opinion
that
it
some
one
in
the
house
returned
the
sergeant
but
it
seems
the
servants
are
all
on
the
square
i
ca
make
it
out
why
on
earth
should
you
suppose
it
to
be
any
one
in
the
house
questioned
herbert
in
considerable
wonderment
because
i
do
was
the
answer
we
police
see
and
note
down
what
others
pass
over
there
was
odds
and
ends
of
things
at
the
time
that
made
us
infer
it
and
i
ca
get
it
out
of
my
mind
it
is
an
impossibility
that
it
could
have
been
a
resident
of
the
house
dissented
herbert
every
one
in
it
is
above
suspicion
who
do
fancy
it
might
have
been
asked
the
sergeant
abruptly
almost
as
if
he
wished
to
surprise
herbert
out
of
an
incautious
answer
but
herbert
had
nothing
to
tell
him
no
suspicion
was
on
his
mind
to
be
surprised
out
of
if
i
could
fancy
it
was
or
might
be
any
particular
individual
i
should
come
to
you
and
say
so
without
asking
he
replied
i
am
as
much
at
fault
as
you
can
be
anthony
may
have
made
slight
enemies
in
the
town
what
with
his
debts
and
his
temper
and
one
thing
or
another
but
no
enemies
of
that
terrible
nature
capable
of
killing
him
i
wish
i
could
see
cause
for
a
reasonable
suspicion
he
added
with
emotion
i
would
give
my
right
arm
stretching
it
out
to
solve
the
mystery
as
well
for
my
sake
as
for
my
dead
brother
well
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
am
down
on
my
beam

concluded
the
sergeant
meanwhile
henry
ashley
was
getting
little
better
he
had
fallen
into
a
state
of
utter
prostration
mental
anguish
had
told
upon
him
physically
and
his
bodily
weakness
was
no
doubt
great
but
he
made
no
effort
to
rouse
himself
he
would
lie
for
hours
his
eyes
noticing
no
one
the
medical
men
said
they
had
seen
nothing
like
it
and
and
ashley
grew
alarmed
the
only
one
to
remonstrate
with
him
he
alone
held
the
key
to
its
cause
was
william
halliburton
william
influence
over
him
was
very
great
he
yielded
to
no
one
not
even
to
his
father
as
he
would
yield
to
william
henry
gave
the
reins
to
his
tongue
and
said
all
sorts
of
irritating
things
to
william
as
he
did
to
every
one
else
it
only
masked
the
deep
affection
the
lasting
friendship
which
had
taken
possession
of
his
heart
for
william
let
me
be
let
me
be
he
said
to
william
one
day
in
answer
to
a
remonstrance
that
he
should
rouse
himself
i
told
you
that
my
life
had
passed
out
with
but
your
life
has
not
passed
out
with
her
argued
william
your
life
is
in
you
just
as
much
as
it
ever
was
and
it
is
your
duty
to
make
some
use
of
your
life
not
to
let
it
run
to
waste
as
you
are
doing
it
does
not
affect
you
was
the
tart
reply
it
does
very
much
affect
me
i
am
grieved
to
see
you
hug
your
pain
instead
of
shaking
it
off
vexed
to
think
that
a
man
should
so
bury
his
days
it
is
an
unfortunate
thing
that
no
one
is
cognizant
of
this
matter
but
myself
is
it
though
retorted
henry
you
are
a
fine
job
comforter
yes
it
is
were
it
known
to
those
about
you
you
would
not
for
shame
lie
here
and
indulge
regrets
after
an
imprudent
and
silly
girl
henry
flashed
an
angry
glance
at
him
from
his
soft
dark
eyes
take
care
my
good
fellow
i
can
stand
some
things
but
i
do
stand
all
an
imprudent
silly
girl
who
does
not
care
a
rush
for
you
emphatically
repeated
william
whose
wild
and
affection
is
given
to
another
was
ever
infatuation
like
unto
yours
have
a
care
i
tell
you
burst
forth
henry
by
what
right
do
you
say
these
things
to
me
i
say
them
for
your
good
and
i
intend
that
you
should
feel
them
when
a
surgeon
knife
probes
a
wound
the
patient
groans
and
winces
but
it
is
done
to
cure
him
you
are
a
man
of
eloquence
sarcastically
rejoined
henry
pity
but
you
could
flourish
at
the
bar
and
take
the
anticipated
shine
out
of
frank
answer
me
one
plain
question
henry
do
you
still
indulge
a
hope
towards
anna
lynn
to
her
becoming
your
wife
with
a
shriek
of
anger
henry
caught
up
his
slipper
and
sent
it
flying
through
the
air
at
william
head
what
that
for
equably
demanded
william
dodging
his
head
out
of
the
way
how
dare
you
hint
at
such
a
thing
i
told
you
there
were
some
things
i
would
stand
is
it
fitting
that
one
who
has
figured
in
such
an
escapade
should
be
made
the
wife
of
an
ashley
if
we
were
left
by
our
two
selves
upon
the
earth
all
else
gone
dead
and
out
of
it
i
marry
her
precisely
so
i
have
judged
you
rightly
then
under
this
state
of
things
what
in
the
name
of
fortune
is
the
use
of
your
lying
here
and
thinking
about
her
i
do
think
about
her
fractiously
returned
henry
you
are
always
fancying
things
you
do
think
about
her
i
can
see
that
you
do
i
should
be
above
it
quaintly
continued
william

and

up
my

you
come
down
to
tea
this
evening
no
i
wo
you
come
here
and
preach
up
this
morality
or
divinity
or
whatever
you
may
please
to
term
it
to
me
but
wait
and
see
how
act
if
you
should
ever
get
struck
on
the
keen
edge
as
i
have
been
come
let
me
help
you
up
do
bother
i
am
not
going
to
get
up
i
at
that
moment
ashley
opened
the
door
his
errand
likewise
was
to
induce
henry
to
leave
his
sofa
and
his
room
and
join
them
below
henry
could
not
be
brought
to
comply
no
i
have
just
told
william
i
can
not
think
why
he
did
not
go
back
and
say
so
he
only
stops
here
to
worry
me
there
get
along
william
and
come
back
when
you
have
swallowed
enough
tea
ashley
laid
his
hand
on
william
arm
as
they
walked
together
along
the
corridor
and
brought
him
to
a
halt
what
this
illness
of
henry
there
is
some
secret
connected
with
it
i
am
sure
and
you
are
cognizant
of
it
i
must
know
what
it
is
ashley
tone
was
a
decided
one
his
manner
firm
william
made
no
reply
tell
me
what
it
is
william
i
can
not
said
william
certainly
not
without
henry
permission
and
i
do
not
think
he
will
give
it
if
it
were
my
secret
sir
instead
of
his
i
would
tell
it
at
your
bidding
is
it
of
the
mind
or
the
body
the
mind
i
think
the
worst
is
over
do
not
speak
to
him
about
it
i
pray
you
sir
william
is
it
anything
that
can
be
remedied
by
money
by
any
means
at
command
it
can
never
be
remedied
replied
william
earnestly
were
the
whole
world
brought
to
bear
upon
it
it
could
do
nothing
time
and
his
own
good
sense
must
effect
the
cure
then
i
may
as
well
not
ask
about
it
if
i
can
not
aid
you
are
fully
in
his
confidence
yes
and
all
that
another
can
do
i
am
doing
we
have
a
daily
battle
i
want
to
rouse
him
out
of
his
apathy

a
loss
for
pomeranian
knoll
pomeranian
knoll
had
scarcely
recovered
its
equanimity
after
the
shock
of
the
departure
of
herbert
dare
for
foreign
parts
when
it
found
itself
about
to
be
shorn
of
another
inmate
the
word
shock
is
used
to
express
the
suddenness
of
the
affair
rather
than
in
its
enlarged
and
more
ordinary
sense
herbert
what
with
one
thing
and
another
had
brought
a
good
deal
of
vexation
upon
the
paternal
home
helstonleigh
also
had
not
been
holding
him
in
extensive
favour
since
the
trial
and
that
home
was
not
sorry
that
he
should
absent
himself
from
it
for
a
time
but
it
certainly
did
not
bargain
for
his
announcing
his
departure
one
night
and
being
off
the
next
morning
yet
such
was
the
course
he
pursued
and
in
that
light
his
departure
may
be
said
to
have
been
a
shock
to
the
town
dare
had
known
of
it
longer
but
he
had
not
proclaimed
it
any
more
than
herbert
had
it
may
be
that
herbert
feared
being
stopped
if
the
intended
journey
got
wind
a
week
or
two
after
this
signora
varsini
received
a
letter
with
a
foreign
on
it
the
fact
was
nothing
extraordinary
in
itself
the
signora
did
occasionally
receive
letters
bearing
foreign
but
this
one
threw
her
into
a
state
of
commotion
the
like
of
which
had
never
been
witnessed
thrusting
the
letter
into
the
deepest
pocket
of
her
dress
when
it
was
delivered
to
her
she
finished
giving
the
music
lesson
to
minny
which
she
was
occupied
upon
and
then
retired
to
her
room
to
peruse
it
from
this
she
emerged
a
short
time
after
with
a
long
face
of
consternation
uttering
frantic
ejaculations
dare
was
quite
alarmed
what
was
the
matter
with
mademoiselle
ah
what
misère
what
désolation
what
tristes
nouvelles
the
letter
was
from
her
aunt
in
paris
who
was
thrown
upon
her
and
she
mademoiselle
must
hasten
thither
without
delay
if
she
could
not
start
by
a
train
that
day
she
must
go
by
the
first
one
the
next
she
was
désolée
to
leave
madame
at
a
coup
her
heart
would
break
in
bidding
adieu
to
the
young
ladies
but
necessity
was
stern
she
must
make
her
baggage
forthwith
and
would
be
obliged
to
madame
for
her
salary
dare
was
taken
as
the
saying
runs
all
of
a
heap
she
had
not
cared
to
part
with
mademoiselle
so
soon
although
the
retaining
her
entailed
an
additional
expense
which
they
could
ill
afford
in
their
gradually
increasing
embarrassments
and
straitening
means
but
the
chief
point
that
puzzled
her
was
the
paying
up
of
the
salary
between
thirty
and
forty
pounds
were
due
there
appeared
however
to
be
no
help
for
it
and
she
applied
to
dare
you
may
as
well
ask
me
for
my
head
as
for
that
sum
was
that
gentleman
reply
thinking
he
was
destined
never
to
find
peace
on
earth
tell
her
you
will
send
it
after
her
if
she
must
go
dare
shook
her
head
it
would
not
be
of
the
least
use
she
was
sure
mademoiselle
was
not
one
to
be
put
off
in
that
way
or
to
depart
without
her
money
how
dare
managed
it
he
perhaps
hardly
knew
himself
but
he
brought
home
the
money
at
night
and
the
governess
was
paid
in
full
on
the
following
morning
there
was
a
ceremonious
loud
and
suggestive
on
the
part
of
mademoiselle
she
saluted
them
all
on
both
cheeks
and
promised
to
write
every
week
at
least
a
fly
came
to
the
door
for
her
and
her
luggage
and
george
dare
mounted
the
box
to
escort
her
to
the
station
mademoiselle
politely
invited
him
inside
but
he
had
just
lighted
a
cigar
and
preferred
to
stop
where
he
was
i
say
mademoiselle
cried
he
after
she
was
seated
in
the
railway
carriage
if
you
should
happen
to
come
across
herbert
i
wish
tell
him
mademoiselle
interrupted
with
a
burst
of
indignation
come
across
monsieur
herbert
what
should
bring
her
coming
across
monsieur
george
must
be
to
think
it
monsieur
herbert
was
not
in
paris
was
he
she
had
understood
he
was
in
holland
oh
well
it
all
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
answered
george
whose
geographical
notions
of
the
continent
were
not
very
definite
perhaps
you
wo
see
him
though
mademoiselle
so
never
mind
mademoiselle
replied
by
telling
him
to
take
care
of
himself
for
the
whistle
was
sounding
george
drew
back
and
watched
the
train
off
mademoiselle
nodding
her
farewell
to
him
from
the
window
and
that
was
the
last
that
helstonleigh
saw
of
dare
italian
governess
the
signora
varsini
helstonleigh
might
not
have
been
any
the
worse
had
it
never
seen
the
first
of
her
dare
after
her
departure
suddenly
remembered
that
mademoiselle
had
once
told
her
she
had
not
a
single
relative
in
the
world
who
could
this
aunt
be
to
whom
she
was
hastening
and
henry
ashley
as
the
weeks
and
the
months
went
on
henry
began
to
rouse
himself
from
his
prostration
his
apathy
william
halliburton
made
no
secret
of
it
to
henry
that
it
was
suspected
he
was
suffering
from
some
inward
grief
which
he
was
concealing
and
that
he
had
been
questioned
on
the
point
by
ashley
you
know
said
william
i
shall
have
no
resource
but
to
unless
you
show
yourself
a
sensible
man
and
come
out
of
this
nonsense
it
alarmed
henry
rather
than
have
his
secret
feelings
betrayed
for
the
family
benefit
he
could
have
died
in
a
grumbling
and
discontented
sort
of
mood
he
went
about
again
and
resumed
his
idle
occupations
such
as
they
were
as
usual
one
evening
william
enticed
him
out
for
a
walk
took
possession
of
his
arm
and
pounced
into
robert
east
before
henry
well
knew
where
he
was
he
sat
down
apathetic
and
indifferent
after
nodding
carelessly
to
the
respectful
salutation
of
the
men
i
must
give
just
ten
minutes
to
them
as
i
am
here
observed
william
you
can
go
to
sleep
the
while
the
ten
minutes
lengthened
into
twenty
and
henry
attention
was
so
far
roused
that
he
came
to
the
table
in
his
impulsive
way
and
began
talking
on
his
own
account
when
william
was
ready
to
go
he
was
not
and
he
actually
told
the
men
that
he
would
come
round
again
it
was
a
great
point
gained
small
beginnings
it
has
been
remarked
lead
to
great
endings
the
humble
confined
way
in
which
the
class
had
begun
at
robert
east
the
vague
ideas
of
william
upon
the
subject
the
doubtings
of
east
and
crouch
were
looked
back
upon
with
a
smile
for
the
little
venture
had
swollen
itself
into
a
great
undertaking
an
undertaking
that
was
destined
to
effect
a
revolution
throughout
the
whole
of
honey
fair
and
might
probably
even
extend
to
helstonleigh
itself
the
drawback
now
was
want
of
room
numbers
were
being
kept
away
by
it
henry
ashley
did
go
again
and
finding
that
books
of
the
right
kind
ran
short
he
the
day
after
his
second
visit
wrote
off
an
order
for
a
whole
cargo
ashley
was
in
a
state
of
inward
delight
anything
to
rouse
him
you
think
it
will
succeed
that
movement
do
you
henry
he
carelessly
observed
it
safe
to
succeed
was
the
answer
william
with
his
palavering
has
gained
the
ear
of
the
fellows
i
do
believe
there
william
halliburton
equal
in
the
whole
world
he
added
with
enthusiasm
fancy
his
sacrificing
his
time
to
such
a
thing
and
for
no
benefit
to
himself
it
will
bear
a
rich
crop
of
fruit
too
if
i
have
the
gift
give
you
a
long
word
for
once
of
ratiocination
this
reform
of
william
will
be
more
extensive
than
we
now
foresee
the
chief
thing
in
these
evenings
was
to
keep
alive
the
interest
of
the
men
not
to
lead
them
to
abstruse
things
which
they
had
a
difficulty
in
understanding
and
remained
strange
to
at
best
but
rather
to
plunge
them
into
familiar
home
topics
the
philosophy
if
you
will
of
everyday
life
there
is
a
right
and
a
wrong
way
of
doing
most
things
and
it
often
happens
that
people
from
ignorance
pursue
the
wrong
of
the
plain
sanitary
laws
relating
to
physical
health
honey
fair
was
intensely
ignorant
of
the
ventilation
of
rooms
of
cleanliness
of
the
most
simple
rules
by
which
the
body
can
be
kept
in
order
they
knew
no
more
than
they
did
of
the
moon
when
a
man
was
to
use
honey
fair
phraseology
took
bad
he
generally
neglected
the
symptoms
altogether
thereby
laying
the
foundation
of
worse
illness
or
else
he
went
to
a
doctor
and
ran
himself
into
expense
a
little
familiarity
with
ordinary
complaints
and
ordinary
antidotes
would
have
remedied
this
an
acquaintance
with
sanitary
laws
would
have
prevented
it
when
children
were
down
with
measles
or
scarlatina
the
careless
of
the
land
allowed
the
maladies
to
take
their
own
course
and
the
sufferers
to
air
themselves
in
the
gutters
as
usual
the
cautious
ones
smothered
the
patients
in
a
hot
room
keeping
up
a
fire
as
large
as
the
stock
of
coals
would
allow
and
borrowing
all
the
blankets
from
the
houses
on
either
side
to
heap
upon
them
no
wonder
the
supply
of
little
coffins
was
great
to
honey
fair
all
these
things
would
be
talked
of
and
discussed
and
a
little
enlightenment
imparted
to
the
men
as
a
guidance
for
the
future
no
one
who
did
not
witness
it
can
imagine
the
delighted
satisfaction
with
which
these
and
similar
practical
topics
were
welcomed
for
they
bore
for
them
a
personal
interest
they
concerned
themselves
their
families
and
their
homes
one
evening
the
way
in
which
honey
fair
rather
liked
to
spend
its
sundays
was
under
discussion
namely
the
men
in
smoking
the
women
slatternly
and
dirty
the
children
fighting
and
quarrelling
in
the
dirt
outside
william
halliburton
was
asking
them
in
a
manner
what
particular
benefit
they
found
in
it
that
it
should
not
be
remedied
could
they
impart
its
pleasures
to
him
if
so
his
voice
suddenly
faltered
and
stopped
standing
just
inside
the
door
of
the
room
a
quiet
spectator
and
listener
of
the
proceedings
was
thomas
ashley
the
men
followed
william
gaze
saw
who
was
amongst
them
and
rose
in
respectful
silence
ashley
came
forward
signing
to
william
to
continue
but
eloquence
had
died
out
leaving
only
a
heightened
colour
in
its
place
in
the
presence
of
ashley
whom
he
so
loved
and
respected
he
had
grown
timid
as
a
child
do
you
know
said
ashley
addressing
the
men
it
gives
me
greater
pleasure
to
see
you
here
than
it
would
do
were
i
to
hear
that
you
had
come
into
a
fortune
they
smiled
and
shook
their
heads
fortunes
did
come
to
the
like
them
never
mind
replied
ashley
fortunes
are
not
the
best
gifts
in
life
he
stayed
talking
with
them
some
little
time
quiet
words
of
encouragement
and
then
withdrew
wishing
them
good
luck
william
left
with
him
and
as
they
passed
through
honey
fair
the
women
ran
to
their
doors
to
gaze
after
them
ashley
slightly
bent
with
his
advancing
years
leaned
upon
william
arm
but
his
face
was
fresh
as
ever
and
his
dark
hair
showed
no
signs
of
age
william
erect
noble
his
height
greater
than
ashley
his
forehead
broader
his
deep
grey
eyes
strangely
earnest
and
sincere
and
a
flitting
smile
playing
on
his
lips
he
was
listening
to
ashley
satisfaction
at
what
he
had
witnessed
how
long
do
you
intend
to
sacrifice
your
evenings
to
them
it
is
no
sacrifice
ashley
i
am
glad
to
do
it
i
consider
it
one
of
the
best
uses
to
which
my
evenings
could
be
given
i
intend
to
enlist
henry
for
good
in
the
cause
if
i
can
do
so
you
will
be
an
ingenious
persuader
if
you
do
returned
ashley
i
would
give
half
i
am
worth
he
abruptly
added
to
see
the
boy
take
an
interest
in
life
it
will
be
sure
to
come
sir
one
of
these
days
i
shall
surprise
him
into
reading
a
good
play
to
the
men
something
to
laugh
at
it
will
be
a
beginning
he
is
very
much
better
observed
ashley
all
that
listless
apathy
is
going
oh
yes
he
is
all
but
cured
what
was
it
william
william
was
taken
by
surprise
he
did
not
answer
and
ashley
repeated
the
question
it
is
his
secret
sir
not
mine
you
must
confide
it
to
me
said
ashley
in
his
tone
of
quiet
firmness
you
know
me
william
when
i
promise
that
neither
it
nor
the
fact
of
its
having
been
disclosed
to
me
shall
ever
escape
me
directly
or
indirectly
to
any
living
person
you
know
that
you
may
depend
upon
me
he
paused
william
did
not
speak
he
was
debating
with
himself
what
he
to
do
william
it
is
a
relief
that
i
must
have
since
my
suspicions
that
there
was
a
secret
were
confirmed
i
can
not
tell
you
what
improbable
fancies
and
fears
have
not
run
riot
in
my
brain
for
prostration
so
excessive
to
have
overtaken
him
one
would
almost
think
he
had
been
guilty
of
murder
or
some
other
unaccountable
crime
must
relieve
my
which
in
spite
of
my
uncontrollable
fancies
i
do
not
doubt
the
truth
will
do
it
will
make
no
difference
to
any
one
it
will
only
be
an
additional
bond
between
myself
and
you
and
you
my
almost
son
william
duty
rose
before
him
clear
and
distinct
but
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
a
whisper
he
loved
anna
lynn
ashley
walked
on
without
comment
william
resumed
had
that
unhappy
affair
not
taken
place
henry
intention
was
to
make
her
his
wife
provided
you
could
have
been
brought
to
consent
to
it
his
whole
days
used
to
be
spent
i
believe
in
planning
how
he
could
best
invent
a
chance
of
obtaining
it
and
now
very
sharply
asked
ashley
now
the
thing
is
at
an
end
for
ever
henry
good
sense
has
come
to
his
aid
i
suppose
i
may
say
his
pride
his
innocent
of
actual
ill
as
anna
was
in
the
affair
there
was
sufficient
reflection
cast
upon
her
to
prove
to
henry
that
his
hopeful
visions
could
never
be
carried
out
that
was
henry
secret
sir
and
i
almost
feared
the
blow
would
have
killed
him
but
he
is
getting
over
it
ashley
drew
a
deep
breath
william
i
thank
you
you
have
relieved
me
from
a
nightmare
and
you
may
forget
having
given
me
the
confidence
if
you
like
for
it
will
never
be
abused
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
space
he
continued
in
a
different
tone
about
space
sir
for
those
protégés
of
yours
at
east
they
seem
to
me
to
be
tolerably
confined
for
it
there
yes
and
that
is
not
the
worst
said
william
men
are
asking
to
join
every
day
and
they
can
not
be
taken
in
ca
think
how
you
manage
to
get
so
many
and
to
keep
them
i
suppose
the
chief
secret
is
that
their
interest
enters
into
it
we
contrive
to
keep
that
up
most
of
them
would
not
go
back
to
the
horned
ram
for
the
world
well
where
shall
you
stow
them
it
is
more
than
i
can
say
sir
we
must
manage
it
somehow
henry
told
me
you
were
ambitious
enough
to
aspire
to
the
mormon
failure
i
was
foolish
enough
to
do
so
replied
william
with
a
laugh
seeing
it
was
very
much
in
the
condition
of
the
famed
picture
taken
of
the
good
primrose
and
his
family
useless
i
went
and
offered
a
rent
for
it
only
a
trifling
sum
it
is
true
but
if
our
fires
only
kept
it
from
damp
one
would
think
the
builder
might
have
been
glad
to
let
it
thrown
as
it
is
upon
his
hands
i
told
him
so
what
did
he
say
he
stood
out
for
thirty
pounds
but
that
more
than
i
than
we
can
afford
and
who
was
going
to
find
the
money
you
william
hesitated
but
did
not
see
any
way
out
of
the
dilemma
well
sir
you
know
it
is
a
sad
pity
for
the
good
work
to
be
stopped
through
so
insignificant
a
trifle
as
want
of
room
i
think
it
is
replied
ashley
you
can
hire
it
and
move
your
forms
and
tables
and
books
into
it
as
soon
as
you
like
i
will
find
the
rent
the
words
took
william
by
surprise
oh
ashley
do
you
really
mean
it
really
mean
it
it
is
little
enough
compared
with
what
you
are
doing
a
few
years
william
and
your
name
may
be
great
in
helstonleigh
you
are
working
on
for
it
william
walked
with
ashley
as
far
as
his
house
and
then
turned
back
to
his
own
he
found
sorrow
there
not
having
been
home
since
for
he
had
taken
tea
at
ashley
he
was
unconscious
of
some
tidings
which
had
been
brought
by
the
afternoon
post
jane
sat
and
grieved
while
she
told
him
her
brother
robert
was
dead
very
rarely
indeed
did
she
hear
from
the
new
world
margaret
appeared
to
be
too
full
of
cares
and
domestic
bustle
to
write
often
she
might
not
have
written
now
but
to
tell
of
the
death
of
robert
i
have
lost
myself
sometimes
in
a
vision
of
seeing
robert
home
again
said
jane
with
a
sigh
and
now
he
is
gone
he
was
not
married
was
he
asked
william
no
i
fear
he
never
got
on
very
well
never
to
be
at
his
ease
gar
came
in
noisily
and
interrupted
them
the
death
of
an
uncle
whom
he
had
never
seen
and
who
had
lived
thousands
of
miles
away
did
not
appear
to
gar
to
be
a
matter
calling
for
any
especial
amount
of
grief
gar
was
in
high
spirits
on
his
own
account
for
gar
was
going
to
cambridge
not
in
all
the
pomp
and
pride
of
an
unlimited
purse
however
but
as
a
humble
sizar
gar
not
seeing
his
way
very
clearly
had
been
wise
enough
to
pluck
up
courage
and
apply
for
counsel
to
the
head
master
of
the
college
school
he
had
told
him
that
he
meant
to
go
to
college
and
how
he
meant
to
go
and
he
asked
keating
if
he
could
help
him
to
a
situation
where
he
might
be
useful
between
terms
a
school
where
i
might
become
a
junior
assistant
suggested
gar
or
any
family
who
would
take
me
to
read
with
their
sons
if
i
only
earned
my
food
it
would
be
so
much
the
less
weight
upon
my
mother
added
he
in
the
candid
spirit
peculiar
to
the
family
have
you
forgotten
that
you
ought
to
work
yourself
out
of
terms
nearly
as
hard
as
in
them
asked
keating
oh
no
sir
i
have
not
forgotten
it
i
will
take
care
to
accomplish
my
own
work
as
well
that
should
not
suffer
keating
looked
at
the
cheerful
hopeful
face
a
sure
index
of
the
brave
hopeful
spirit
he
had
taken
unusual
interest
in
the
two
halliburtons
so
clever
and
persevering
it
had
been
impossible
for
him
not
to
do
so
for
if
keating
had
a
weakness
it
was
for
a
good
classical
scholar
i
see
about
it
gar
said
he
but
you
are
rather
young
to
read
with
students
and
i
do
not
suppose
any
school
would
be
willing
to
engage
you
on
account
of
the
interruption
that
keeping
your
terms
would
cause
if
nothing
better
turns
up
you
can
remain
in
the
college
here
and
undertake
one
of
the
junior
desks
i
should
give
you
nothing
for
it
added
the
master
except
your
meals
those
you
would
be
welcome
to
take
at
my
house
with
my
private
pupils
sleeping
at
your
own
home
and
i
think
that
for
you
it
would
be
a
better
arrangement
than
any
other
for
it
would
leave
you
plenty
of
time
for
your
own
studies
and
i
could
still
superintend
them
gar
thought
the
arrangement
would
be
it
would
be
the
very
thing
not
that
i
ever
thought
of
it
he
ingenuously
said
i
did
not
know
the
college
school
admitted
assistants
neither
does
it
replied
the
master
you
would
be
ostensibly
my
private
pupil
and
if
i
choose
to
set
a
private
pupil
to
keep
the
desks
to
their
work
that
is
my
affair
gar
could
only
reiterate
his
thanks
i
am
pleased
to
give
you
this
little
encouragement
remarked
keating
when
i
see
boys
hopefully
plodding
on
in
the
teeth
of
difficulties
of
brave
heart
of
sterling
conduct
they
deserve
all
the
encouragement
that
can
be
given
to
them
if
you
and
your
brothers
only
go
on
as
you
have
hitherto
gone
on
you
will
stand
in
as
bright
examples
of
what
industry
and
perseverance
can
achieve
so
that
altogether
gar
was
in
spirits
and
did
not
by
any
means
put
on
superfluous
mourning
for
a
gentleman
who
had
died
in
the
backwoods
of
canada
although
he
was
his
mother
brother
chapter
xvi
an
offer
of
marriage
mary
said
ashley
i
have
received
an
offer
of
marriage
for
you
a
somewhat
abrupt
announcement
to
make
to
a
young
lady
and
ashley
spoke
in
the
gravest
tone
they
were
seated
round
the
breakfast
table
mary
by
her
mother
side
who
was
pouring
out
the
coffee
mary
looked
surprised
rather
amused
but
that
was
the
only
emotion
discernible
in
her
countenance
it
is
fine
to
be
you
miss
mary
struck
in
henry
before
anyone
could
speak
pray
sir
who
is
the
venturer
he
assures
me
that
his
happiness
is
bound
up
in
his
offer
being
accepted
resumed
ashley
i
fancy
he
felt
inclined
to
assure
me
that
mary
was
also
of
course
all
i
can
do
is
to
lay
the
proposal
before
her
what
it
that
you
are
talking
about
thomas
interposed
ashley
unable
until
then
to
say
a
word
and
speaking
with
some
irritability
i
do
not
consider
mary
old
enough
to
be
married
how
can
you
think
of
saying
such
things
to
her
neither
do
i
mamma
said
mary
with
a
laugh
i
like
my
home
too
well
to
leave
it
and
while
you
are
talking
sentiment
my
curiosity
is
on
the
rack
cried
henry
i
have
inquired
the
name
of
the
bridegroom
and
i
should
like
to
be
answered
the
bridegroom
put
in
mary
mary
i
am
ashamed
of
you
went
on
henry
i
blush
for
your
manners
nice
credit
she
does
to
your
bringing
up
mamma
when
young
ladies
of
condition
receive
a
celestial
offer
they
behave
with
due
propriety
hang
their
heads
with
a
blush
and
subdue
their
voice
to
a
whisper
and
here
mary
look
at
her
talking
quite
loudly
and
making
merry
over
it
once
more
sir
who
is
the
adventurous
gentleman
is
it
good
old
general
wells
our
gouty
neighbour
opposite
who
is
lifted
in
and
out
of
his
chariot
for
his
daily
airing
i
have
told
mary
repeatedly
that
she
was
setting
her
cap
at
him
it
is
not
so
advantageous
a
proposal
in
a
financial
point
of
view
observed
ashley
maintaining
his
impassibility
it
proceeds
from
one
of
my
dependents
at
the
manufactory
mary
had
the
in
her
hand
at
the
moment
and
a
sudden
tremor
seemed
to
seize
her
she
set
it
down
but
so
clumsily
that
half
the
lumps
fell
out
her
face
had
turned
to
a
glowing
crimson
ashley
noticed
it
ashley
only
noticed
the
sugar
mary
how
came
you
to
do
that
very
careless
my
dear
mary
began
meekly
to
pick
up
the
sugar
the
flush
giving
way
to
pallor
she
lifted
her
handkerchief
to
her
face
and
held
it
there
as
if
she
had
a
cold
the
honour
comes
from
cyril
dare
said
ashley
cyril
dare
cyril
dare
in
different
tones
of
scorn
but
each
expressing
it
most
fully
the
repetition
broke
from
ashley
and
henry
mary
on
the
contrary
recovered
her
equanimity
and
her
countenance
she
laughed
out
as
if
she
were
glad
what
did
you
say
to
him
papa
i
gave
him
my
opinion
only
that
i
thought
he
had
mistaken
my
daughter
if
he
entertained
hopes
that
she
would
listen
to
his
suit
the
question
rests
with
you
mary
oh
papa
what
nonsense
rests
with
me
why
you
know
i
would
never
have
cyril
dare
a
smile
crossed
ashley
face
he
probably
known
it
cyril
dare
repeated
mary
as
if
unable
to
overcome
her
astonishment
he
must
have
turned
silly
i
would
not
have
cyril
dare
if
he
were
worth
his
weight
in
gold
and
he
must
be
worth
a
great
deal
more
than
his
weight
in
gold
mary
before
i
would
consent
to
your
having
him
quietly
rejoined
ashley
have
echoed
henry
if
i
feared
there
was
a
danger
of
the
daughter
of
all
the
ashleys
so
degrading
herself
i
should
bribe
cook
to
make
an
arsenic
cake
cut
the
young
lady
a
portion
myself
and
stand
by
while
she
ate
it
do
talk
foolishly
henry
rebuked
ashley
mamma
i
must
say
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
half
so
foolish
as
cyril
dare
was
cried
mary
with
spirit
ashley
relieved
from
any
temporary
fear
of
losing
mary
was
comfortably
going
on
with
her
breakfast
did
cyril
say
how
he
meant
to
provide
for
mary
if
he
obtained
her
asked
she
with
an
amused
look
he
did
not
touch
upon
ways
and
means
i
conclude
that
he
intended
i
should
have
the
honour
of
keeping
them
both
henry
ashley
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
if
this
is
not
the
richest
joke
i
have
heard
for
a
long
while
cyril
dare
the
kinsman
of
herbert
the
beautiful
confound
his
then
you
decline
the
honour
of
the
alliance
mary
said
ashley
what
am
i
to
tell
him
what
you
please
papa
tell
him
if
you
like
that
i
would
rather
marry
a
i
if
it
came
to
a
choice
between
the
two
how
very
senseless
of
cyril
to
think
of
such
a
thing
how
very
shrewd
i
think
mary
if
he
could
only
have
got
you
was
the
reply
of
ashley
if
saucily
put
in
mary
henry
bent
over
the
table
to
his
sister
i
tell
you
what
mary
you
go
this
morning
and
offer
yourself
to
our
gouty
friend
the
general
he
will
jump
at
it
and
we
have
the
banns
put
up
we
can
not
you
know
be
subjected
to
such
shocks
as
these
on
your
account
it
is
unreasonable
to
expect
it
i
assure
you
it
will
be
the
most
effectual
plan
to
set
cyril
dare
and
those
of
his
tribe
at
rest
no
thank
you
turning
to
ashley
no
more
coffee
this
has
been
enough
breakfast
for
me
who
is
this
asked
ashley
as
footsteps
were
heard
on
the
ashley
lifted
her
eyes
it
is
william
halliburton
william
halliburton
echoed
henry
ah
if
you
could
have
put
his
heart
and
intellect
into
cyril
form
now
it
might
have
done
he
spoke
with
that
freedom
of
speech
which
characterized
him
and
in
which
from
his
infirmity
he
had
not
been
checked
no
one
made
any
remark
in
answer
and
william
entered
he
had
come
to
ask
some
business
question
of
ashley
i
will
walk
down
with
you
said
ashley
and
see
to
it
take
a
seat
william
it
is
getting
late
sir
well
i
suppose
you
can
afford
to
be
late
for
once
replied
ashley
and
william
smiled
as
he
sat
down
we
have
had
a
letter
from
cambridge
this
morning
from
gar
and
how
does
gar
get
on
asked
henry
first
rate
he
takes
a
leaf
out
of
frank
book
determined
to
see
no
difficulties
in
his
way
frank
letters
are
always
cheering
i
really
believe
he
cares
no
more
for
being
a
servitor
than
he
would
for
wearing
a
hat
at
christchurch
all
his
wish
is
to
get
on
he
looks
to
the
future
but
he
does
his
duty
in
the
present
quietly
remarked
ashley
william
smiled
it
is
the
only
way
to
insure
the
future
sir
frank
and
gar
have
been
learning
that
all
their
lives
ashley
telling
william
not
to
get
the
fidgets
for
he
was
not
ready
yet
withdrew
to
the
next
room
with
his
wife
they
had
some
weighty
domestic
matter
to
settle
touching
a
dinner
party
henry
linked
his
arm
within
william
and
drew
him
to
the
window
throwing
it
open
to
the
early
spring
sunshine
mary
remained
at
the
breakfast
table
what
do
you
think
cyril
dare
the
presuming
has
had
the
conscience
to
ask
began
he
i
know
replied
william
i
heard
him
say
he
should
ask
it
yesterday
the
deuce
you
did
uttered
henry
and
you
did
not
knock
him
down
knock
him
down
was
it
any
business
of
mine
you
might
have
done
it
as
my
friend
i
think
a
slight
correction
of
his
impudence
i
do
not
see
that
it
is
your
business
either
returned
william
it
is
mr
ashley
oh
indeed
perhaps
you
would
like
it
carried
out
i
have
no
right
to
say
it
shall
not
be
thank
you
chafed
henry
mary
he
called
out
to
his
sister
halliburton
recommending
that
that
business
we
know
of
shall
be
carried
out
william
only
laughed
he
was
accustomed
to
henry
exaggerations
it
is
what
cyril
has
been
expecting
for
years
said
he
henry
gazed
at
him
what
is
what
are
you
talking
of
being
taken
into
partnership
by
mr
ashley
is
it
you
are
blundering
over
does
he
expect
it
continued
henry
after
a
pause
cyril
said
yesterday
the
firm
would
soon
be
ashley
and
dare
did
he
indeed
he
had
better
not
count
upon
it
so
as
to
disturb
his
digestion
that
presumption
enough
goodness
knows
but
it
is
a
mere
compared
with
the
other
he
has
asked
for
mary
it
is
true
as
that
we
are
standing
here
william
turned
his
questioning
gaze
on
henry
he
did
not
understand
asked
for
her
for
what
what
to
do
to
be
his
wife
oh
the
strange
sound
was
not
a
burst
of
indignation
or
a
groan
of
pain
it
was
a
mixture
of
both
william
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
window
he
actually
asked
the
master
for
her
yesterday
went
on
henry
he
said
his
heart
or
liver
or
some
such
part
of
him
was
bound
up
in
her
as
she
was
bound
up
in
him
fancy
the
honour
of
her
becoming
mrs
cyril
william
did
not
turn
his
head
not
a
glimpse
of
his
face
could
be
caught
will
she
have
him
he
asked
at
length
the
question
exasperated
henry
yes
she
will
there
go
and
congratulate
her
you
are
a
fool
william
the
sound
of
his
angry
voice
not
his
words
reached
mary
ears
she
came
forward
what
is
the
matter
henry
so
he
is
a
fool
was
henry
answer
he
wants
to
know
if
you
are
going
to
marry
cyril
dare
i
tell
him
yes
no
one
but
an
idiot
would
have
asked
it
william
turned
his
face
full
of
an
emotion
that
henry
had
never
seen
there
a
streak
of
scarlet
on
his
cheeks
his
earnest
eyes
strangely
troubled
and
mary
her
face
seemed
to
have
borrowed
the
same
flush
as
she
stood
there
her
head
and
eyelashes
bent
henry
ashley
gazed
first
at
one
next
at
the
other
and
then
turned
and
leaned
from
the
window
himself
in
contrition
for
having
spoken
so
openly
of
his
sister
affairs
not
at
all
whistling
the
bars
of
a
renowned
comic
song
of
the
day
called
the
steam
arm
ashley
put
in
his
head
i
am
ready
william
william
touched
mary
hand
in
silence
by
way
of
adieu
and
halted
as
he
passed
henry
shall
you
come
round
to
the
men
no
i
sha
retorted
henry
i
am
upset
for
the
day
he
was
halfway
down
the
path
when
he
heard
himself
called
by
henry
still
leaning
from
the
window
he
went
back
to
him
she
said
she
rather
have
a
than
cyril
dare
do
go
and
make
a
muff
of
yourself
again
william
turned
away
without
any
answer
ashley
who
had
waited
put
his
arm
within
his
and
they
proceeded
to
the
manufactory
have
you
heard
this
rumour
respecting
herbert
dare
that
has
been
wafted
over
from
germany
within
the
last
day
or
two
inquired
ashley
as
they
walked
along
yes
sir
replied
william
i
wonder
if
it
is
true
william
did
not
answer
william
private
opinion
was
that
it
was
true
it
had
been
tolerably
well
authenticated
a
rumour
that
need
not
be
very
specifically
enlarged
upon
here
helstonleigh
never
came
to
the
bottom
of
it
never
knew
for
certain
how
much
of
it
was
true
and
how
much
false
and
we
can
not
expect
to
be
better
favoured
than
helstonleigh
in
the
point
of
enlightenment
it
was
not
a
pleasant
rumour
and
the
late
governess
name
was
unaccountably
mixed
up
in
it
for
one
thing
it
said
that
herbert
dare
finding
commercial
pursuits
not
congenial
to
his
taste
had
given
them
up
and
was
roaming
about
germany
mademoiselle
also
it
was
a
report
that
did
not
do
credit
to
herbert
or
tend
to
reflect
respectability
on
his
family
yet
ashley
fully
believed
that
to
that
report
he
owed
the
application
of
cyril
with
regard
to
mary
strange
as
it
may
appear
at
a
first
glance
to
say
it
the
application
had
astonished
ashley
beyond
expression
he
could
only
come
to
the
conclusion
that
cyril
must
have
entertained
the
hope
for
some
time
but
had
been
induced
to
disclose
it
prematurely
so
prematurely
even
allowing
that
other
circumstances
favoured
it
that
ashley
was
tempted
to
laugh
a
man
without
means
without
a
home
without
any
definite
prospects
merely
a
workman
as
might
be
said
in
his
manufactory
upon
a
very
small
salary
it
was
ridiculous
in
the
extreme
for
to
offer
marriage
to
miss
ashley
ashley
of
upright
conduct
in
the
sight
of
day
was
not
one
to
wink
at
folly
any
escapade
such
as
that
now
flying
about
helstonleigh
as
attributed
to
herbert
would
not
be
an
additional
recommendation
in
cyril
favour
had
he
hastened
to
speak
it
should
reach
ashley
ears
ashley
thought
so
an
hour
after
cyril
had
spoken
he
heard
the
scandal
and
it
flashed
over
his
mind
that
to
that
he
was
indebted
for
the
premature
honour
cyril
would
have
liked
to
secure
his
consent
before
anything
unpleasant
transpired
as
ashley
came
in
view
of
the
manufactory
cyril
dare
observed
him
cyril
was
lounging
in
an
indolent
manner
at
the
entrance
doors
exchanging
greetings
with
the
various
he
ought
to
have
been
inside
at
his
business
but
oughts
went
for
little
with
cyril
since
samuel
lynn
departure
cyril
had
been
living
in
clover
enjoying
as
much
idleness
as
he
liked
william
assumed
no
authority
over
him
though
full
authority
had
been
given
to
william
over
the
manufactory
in
general
and
cyril
except
when
he
just
happened
to
be
under
ashley
eye
passed
his
time
agreeably
cyril
stared
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
master
and
then
went
in
his
spirits
going
down
a
little
to
see
the
master
thus
walking
confidentially
with
william
seemed
to
argue
unfavourably
for
his
suit
though
why
it
should
seem
so
cyril
did
not
know
cyril
staring
was
occasioned
by
that
fact
he
had
never
been
promoted
to
the
honour
of
thus
walking
familiarly
with
ashley
in
fact
for
the
master
a
reserved
and
proud
man
with
all
his
good
qualities
to
link
his
arm
within
a
dependant
astonished
cyril
considerably
when
they
entered
cyril
was
at
work
in
his
apron
standing
at
the
counter
in
the
master
room
steady
and
assiduous
as
though
he
had
been
there
for
the
last
the
master
came
in
but
william
remained
in
lynn
room
good
morning
sir
said
cyril
good
morning
replied
the
master
he
sat
down
to
his
desk
and
opened
a
letter
that
was
lying
on
it
presently
he
looked
up
cyril
yes
sir
step
here
cyril
approached
the
desk
feeling
what
a
lady
might
call
nervous
the
decisive
moment
had
come
should
he
be
provided
for
for
life
enjoy
a
good
position
and
the
means
of
living
as
a
gentleman
or
would
his
unlucky
star
prevail
and
consign
him
to
he
did
not
quite
foresee
to
what
i
have
spoken
to
miss
ashley
she
was
excessively
surprised
at
your
application
and
begs
to
decline
it
in
the
most
unequivocal
manner
allow
me
to
add
a
recommendation
from
myself
that
you
bury
in
oblivion
the
fact
of
your
having
made
it
cyril
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
looked
foolish
why
he
asked
repeated
ashley
i
think
you
could
answer
that
query
for
yourself
and
save
me
the
trouble
i
do
not
wish
to
go
too
closely
into
facts
and
causes
past
and
present
unless
you
desire
it
one
thing
you
must
be
aware
of
cyril
that
such
a
proposition
from
you
to
my
daughter
was
utterly
out
of
place
i
should
have
rejected
it
yesterday
in
fact
in
the
surprise
of
the
moment
i
almost
spoke
out
more
plainly
than
you
would
have
liked
but
that
i
thought
it
as
well
for
you
to
have
miss
ashley
opinion
as
well
as
my
own
why
am
i
rejected
sir
continued
cyril
ashley
waved
his
hand
with
dignity
return
to
your
employment
cyril
it
is
quite
sufficient
for
you
to
know
that
you
are
rejected
without
my
going
into
motives
and
reasons
they
might
not
i
say
be
palatable
to
you
cyril
did
not
venture
to
press
it
further
he
returned
to
the
counter
and
stood
there
ostensibly
going
on
with
his
work
and
boiling
over
with
rage
the
master
sat
some
little
time
longer
and
then
left
the
room
soon
after
william
came
in
his
eye
caught
cyril
employment
cyril
cried
he
hastily
advancing
to
him
you
must
not
make
up
those
gloves
i
told
you
yesterday
not
to
touch
them
a
dangerous
speech
cyril
was
not
unlike
touchwood
at
that
moment
liable
to
go
off
at
the
slightest
contact
you
told
me
he
burst
forth
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
do
what
you
choose
to
tell
me
try
it
on
for
the
future
that
all
tell
they
are
the
very
best
gloves
and
must
be
sorted
with
nicety
returned
william
do
you
know
that
the
sorting
of
the
last
parcel
was
found
fault
with
in
london
it
vexed
the
master
and
he
desired
me
to
do
all
the
sorting
myself
until
lynn
should
be
at
home
i
choose
to
sort
returned
cyril
but
you
must
not
sort
in
the
face
of
the
master
orders
or
if
you
do
i
must
go
over
them
again
that
right
praise
up
yourself
foamed
cyril
of
course
you
are
an
efficient
sorter
and
i
am
a
bad
one
you
might
be
as
good
a
sorter
as
any
one
if
you
chose
to
give
it
proper
time
and
attention
what
a
temper
you
are
in
this
morning
the
matter
the
matter
is
that
i
have
submitted
to
your
rule
long
enough
but
do
it
no
longer
was
the
reply
of
cyril
whose
anger
was
gathering
strength
and
whose
ill
feeling
towards
william
deep
down
in
his
heart
from
long
ago
had
had
envy
added
to
it
of
late
william
made
no
reply
he
carefully
swept
the
dozens
that
cyril
had
made
up
farther
down
the
counter
that
they
might
be
in
a
stronger
light
what
that
for
cried
cyril
how
dare
you
meddle
with
my
work
they
are
done
as
well
as
you
can
do
them
any
day
now
where
the
use
of
flying
into
this
passion
cyril
what
it
for
do
you
suppose
i
go
over
your
work
again
for
pleasure
or
to
find
fault
with
it
i
do
it
because
the
master
has
ordered
me
to
make
up
every
dozen
that
goes
out
and
if
you
do
it
first
of
all
it
is
sheer
waste
of
time
see
here
added
william
holding
two
or
three
pairs
towards
him
will
not
do
for
firsts
angry
cyril
he
was
quite
beside
himself
with
anger
it
was
not
this
trifling
matter
in
the
daily
business
that
would
have
excited
him
but
ashley
rejection
his
words
altogether
had
turned
cyril
blood
into
gall
and
this
was
made
the
outlet
he
dashed
the
gloves
out
of
william
hand
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
and
struck
him
a
powerful
blow
on
the
chest
it
caused
william
to
stagger
he
was
unprepared
for
it
but
whether
he
would
have
returned
it
must
remain
uncertain
before
there
was
time
or
opportunity
cyril
found
himself
whirled
backwards
by
a
hand
as
powerful
as
his
own
and
a
voice
of
stern
authority
was
demanding
the
meaning
of
the
scene
the
hand
the
voice
were
those
of
the
master
chapter
xvii
the
explosion
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
cyril
dare
had
cyril
supposed
that
the
master
was
so
close
at
hand
he
had
subdued
his
passion
to
something
short
of
striking
a
blow
he
stood
against
the
counter
his
brow
lowering
his
eye
furious
william
looked
angry
too
ashley
calm
and
dignified
waited
for
an
answer
none
came
cyril
was
too
excited
to
speak
will
you
explain
it
said
the
master
turning
to
william
fighting
in
my
i
can
not
sir
replied
william
recovering
his
equanimity
i
do
not
understand
it
i
did
nothing
to
provoke
him
that
i
am
aware
of
it
is
true
i
said
i
must
go
over
the
gloves
again
that
he
had
made
up
what
are
those
gloves
flung
there
i
was
showing
them
to
him
that
they
were
not
fit
for
firsts
they
are
fit
for
firsts
retorted
cyril
breaking
his
silence
i
know
i
did
put
a
pair
in
that
was
not
up
to
the
mark
the
master
went
and
picked
up
the
gloves
himself
taking
them
to
the
light
he
turned
them
about
in
his
hands
i
should
put
two
of
these
pairs
as
seconds
and
one
as
thirds
remarked
he
you
must
have
been
asleep
when
you
put
this
one
among
the
firsts
he
continued
indicating
the
latter
pair
and
speaking
to
cyril
dare
it
has
a
flaw
in
it
of
course
you
will
uphold
halliburton
sir
whatever
he
may
say
that
has
been
the
case
for
a
long
time
past
he
spoke
in
an
insolent
tone
such
as
none
within
the
walls
of
that
manufactory
had
ever
dared
to
use
to
the
master
the
master
turned
upon
him
speaking
quietly
and
significantly
you
forget
yourself
cyril
dare
all
he
does
is
right
and
all
i
do
is
wrong
persisted
cyril
you
treat
him
sir
just
as
though
you
considered
him
the
gentleman
instead
of
me
a
which
had
too
much
mockery
in
it
to
please
cyril
crossed
the
lips
of
ashley
what
that
you
say
about
being
a
gentleman
cyril
repeat
it
will
you
i
should
like
to
hear
it
again
mockery
and
double
mockery
cyril
suggestive
ears
detected
it
in
the
tone
if
no
other
ears
could
do
so
it
did
not
improve
his
temper
the
thing
is
this
sir
i
wo
submit
to
this
state
of
affairs
any
longer
i
was
not
placed
here
to
be
ruled
over
by
him
and
if
things
ca
be
put
upon
a
better
footing
one
of
us
must
leave
then
as
it
has
come
to
this
explosion
i
say
the
same
struck
in
william
it
is
high
time
that
things
were
put
upon
a
better
footing
cyril
you
have
forced
me
to
speak
and
you
must
take
the
consequences
sir
turning
to
the
master
my
authority
over
the
men
is
ridiculed
in
their
hearing
it
ought
not
to
be
so
by
whom
demanded
the
master
you
can
ask
that
question
of
cyril
sir
the
master
did
ask
it
of
cyril
have
you
done
this
possibly
i
have
innocently
returned
cyril
you
know
you
have
rejoined
william
only
yesterday
when
i
was
giving
directions
to
the
stainers
he
derided
all
i
said
and
one
of
them
inquired
whether
i
had
received
orders
for
what
i
was
telling
them
if
the
authority
vested
in
me
is
to
be
undermined
the
men
will
soon
set
it
at
naught
ashley
looked
provoked
more
so
than
william
ever
remembered
to
have
seen
him
he
paused
a
moment
his
lips
quivering
angrily
and
then
flung
open
the
door
dick
dick
a
young
tinker
of
ten
black
in
clothes
and
in
skin
came
flying
at
the
summons
and
its
unusually
stern
tone
please
sir
ring
the
large
bell
dick
stared
with
all
his
eyes
at
hearing
the
words
to
ring
the
large
bell
between
ten
and
eleven
in
the
morning
was
a
marvel
that
had
never
happened
in
dick
experience
but
the
master
orders
were
to
be
obeyed
not
questioned
and
dick
rang
out
a
prolonged
peal
the
master
looked
into
the
james
meeking
i
have
ordered
the
bell
rung
for
the
men
pass
the
word
for
them
to
come
into
my
room
and
do
you
and
east
come
with
them
the
men
appeared
flocking
from
all
parts
of
the
premises
their
astonishment
certainly
not
inferior
to
dick
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
the
wholesale
summoning
to
the
presence
of
the
master
they
stood
there
crowding
a
sea
of
curious
faces
dick
consigned
to
the
background
climbed
up
the
and
held
on
by
it
in
a
mysterious
manner
ashley
drew
william
to
his
side
and
laid
his
hand
upon
him
it
has
been
told
to
me
that
the
authority
vested
in
halliburton
has
not
been
implicitly
obeyed
by
every
one
in
the
manufactory
i
have
called
you
before
me
to
give
you
my
instructions
personally
upon
the
point
that
there
may
be
no
misunderstanding
in
the
future
whatever
directions
he
may
see
well
to
give
you
will
receive
them
from
him
as
you
would
from
myself
i
invest
him
with
full
and
complete
power
and
in
all
my
absences
from
the
manufactory
whether
they
may
be
of
an
hour
a
day
or
any
longer
duration
halliburton
is
its
master
they
touched
their
hair
turned
and
went
out
as
far
as
the
collecting
there
to
talk
in
a
short
time
one
of
them
was
seen
coming
back
again
a
man
a
sorter
of
leather
he
addressed
himself
to
ashley
we
have
not
disputed
his
orders
please
sir
that
we
can
call
to
mind
and
if
we
have
done
it
unintentional
we
ask
pardon
for
it
for
what
we
never
thought
to
do
next
to
yourself
sir
we
could
wish
for
a
better
master
than
young
halliburton
we
think
as
much
of
him
sir
as
we
should
if
he
was
your
own
son
all
right
my
men
cheerfully
responded
thomas
ashley
but
was
not
cyril
put
in
the
background
by
this
as
badly
as
dick
had
been
and
cyril
had
no
to
climb
and
so
obtain
vantage
ground
he
had
stood
with
his
back
to
the
crowd
and
his
face
to
the
counter
when
the
men
were
out
of
hearing
he
turned
and
walked
up
to
the
master
it
is
the
place
i
thought
to
fill
said
he
it
is
the
place
that
was
promised
me
not
promised
replied
ashley
not
thought
to
be
promised
a
very
long
time
ago
you
may
have
been
spoken
of
conditionally
as
likely
to
fill
it
conditionally
i
say
conditionally
on
what
sir
on
your
fitness
for
it
by
conduct
and
by
capability
what
is
the
matter
with
my
conduct
sir
returned
cyril
his
tone
a
sharp
one
it
is
bad
curtly
replied
ashley
deceitful
in
public
bad
in
private
i
have
told
you
once
before
this
morning
that
i
do
not
care
to
go
into
details
you
must
know
that
there
is
no
necessity
for
my
doing
so
cyril
paused
i
have
been
led
to
expect
sir
that
you
would
take
me
into
partnership
not
by
me
said
the
master
my
father
and
mother
had
given
me
the
hope
ever
since
i
came
here
i
can
not
help
that
they
had
no
authority
for
it
from
me
they
have
always
said
i
should
be
made
your
partner
and
persisted
cyril
they
have
it
is
very
obliging
of
them
i
am
sure
to
settle
my
affairs
for
me
even
to
the
disposal
of
my
daughter
pray
what
nice
little
destiny
may
they
have
carved
out
for
ashley
or
for
my
son
cyril
chafed
at
the
words
he
would
have
liked
just
then
to
strike
ashley
as
he
had
struck
william
would
i
ever
have
demeaned
myself
to
enter
a
glove
manufactory
disgracing
my
family
had
i
known
i
was
to
be
only
a
workman
in
it
he
cried
no
sir
that
i
never
would
i
am
rightly
served
for
putting
myself
out
of
my
position
as
a
gentleman
ashley
but
for
the
pity
he
felt
could
have
laughed
outright
he
really
did
feel
pity
for
cyril
he
believed
that
the
unhappy
way
in
which
the
young
dares
were
turning
out
might
be
laid
to
the
fault
of
their
rearing
and
this
had
rendered
him
considerate
to
cyril
considerate
he
had
for
a
long
while
been
he
himself
alone
knew
cyril
perhaps
suspected
it
is
a
shame
cried
cyril
to
be
dealt
with
in
this
way
is
nothing
less
than
a
fraud
upon
me
i
was
led
to
expect
that
i
should
be
made
your
partner
wait
a
bit
cyril
i
am
willing
to
put
you
right
upon
the
point
the
proposal
that
you
should
be
placed
here
emanated
in
the
first
instance
from
your
father
he
came
to
me
one
day
here
in
this
very
room
saying
that
he
concluded
i
should
not
put
henry
to
business
and
thought
it
would
be
a
fine
opening
for
his
son
cyril
he
hinted
that
i
should
want
some
one
to
succeed
me
and
that
you
might
come
to
it
with
that
view
but
i
most
distinctly
disclaimed
endorsing
that
hint
in
the
remotest
degree
i
would
not
subscribe
to
it
so
much
as
by
a
vague
it
may
be
so
all
that
i
conceded
upon
the
point
was
this
i
told
dare
that
when
the
time
came
for
me
to
be
looking
out
for
some
one
to
succeed
me
if
it
ever
did
come
and
i
found
his
son
you
had
served
me
faithfully
was
upright
in
conduct
and
in
heart
one
in
short
whom
i
could
thoroughly
confide
in
why
then
he
should
have
the
preference
over
any
other
so
much
i
did
say
cyril
but
no
more
and
why
wo
you
give
me
the
preference
sir
ashley
looked
at
him
apparently
in
surprise
that
he
could
ask
the
question
he
bent
his
head
forward
and
spoke
in
a
low
tone
but
one
full
of
meaning
upright
in
conduct
and
in
heart
i
said
cyril
it
was
an
absolute
condition
cyril
gaze
fell
before
ashley
his
conscience
may
have
pricked
him
and
he
had
the
grace
to
look
ashamed
of
himself
there
ensued
a
pause
presently
cyril
looked
up
then
i
am
to
understand
sir
that
all
hope
of
being
your
partner
and
successor
is
over
it
is
it
has
been
over
this
many
a
year
cyril
i
should
do
wrong
to
deal
otherwise
than
perfectly
plainly
with
you
were
you
to
reform
anything
there
may
have
been
amiss
in
your
conduct
to
become
a
model
of
excellence
in
the
sight
of
helstonleigh
i
could
never
admit
your
name
to
be
associated
with
mine
the
very
notion
is
offensive
to
me
cyril
it
was
a
great
wonder
restrained
his
passion
perhaps
i
had
better
leave
then
he
said
you
are
welcome
to
stay
until
you
can
find
a
situation
more
agreeable
to
you
replied
ashley
provided
you
undertake
to
behave
yourself
stay
and
for
nothing
in
the
end
echoed
cyril
no
that
i
never
will
if
i
must
remain
a
dependant
i
try
it
on
at
something
else
i
am
sick
of
this
he
untied
his
apron
dashed
it
on
to
the
floor
and
went
out
without
another
word
so
furiously
did
he
stamp
through
the
that
james
meeking
turned
round
to
look
at
him
and
dick
taking
a
recreative
balance
at
that
moment
on
the
edge
of
an
upright
thought
he
must
be
running
for
the
dick
speculations
were
disturbed
by
the
sound
of
the
master
voice
calling
to
him
he
hastened
to
the
and
was
ordered
to
take
that
apron
away
dick
picked
it
up
and
withdrew
with
it
folding
it
carefully
against
cyril
should
come
in
dick
little
thought
the
manufactory
had
seen
the
last
of
him
ashley
was
indulging
in
a
quiet
laugh
demeaning
himself
by
entering
my
manufactory
disgracing
his
family
the
high
blood
of
the
dares
poor
cyril
william
do
you
look
at
it
in
the
same
light
william
had
remained
in
the
room
taking
no
part
whatever
in
the
final
contest
he
had
stood
with
his
back
to
them
following
his
occupation
he
turned
round
now
sir
you
know
i
do
not
you
once
told
me
it
presented
no
field
for
getting
on
what
was
the
word
you
used
was
it
ambition
truly
there
not
much
ambition
attached
to
it
nevertheless
i
am
satisfied
with
my
career
william
although
i
am
only
the
glove
manufacturer
thomas
ashley
satisfied
how
many
a
one
would
be
proud
to
be
in
the
position
of
thomas
ashley
william
did
not
say
so
he
began
to
speak
of
cyril
dare
do
you
think
he
will
come
back
again
sir
i
do
not
think
he
will
should
he
do
so
the
doors
are
closed
to
him
he
has
left
of
his
own
accord
and
i
shall
not
allow
him
to
return
i
am
very
sorry
remarked
william
it
has
been
partly
my
fault
do
not
make
yourself
uneasy
i
have
cyril
dare
here
have
allowed
him
to
remain
on
sufferance
and
that
is
the
best
that
can
be
said
of
it
he
may
feel
it
as
a
blow
as
a
jubilee
you
mean
it
will
be
nothing
less
to
him
he
has
hated
the
manufactory
with
all
his
heart
from
the
moment
he
first
entered
it
and
is
now
if
we
could
see
him
kicking
up
his
heels
with
delight
at
the
emancipation
cyril
dare
my
partner
william
continued
his
work
saying
nothing
ashley
resumed
i
must
be
casting
my
thoughts
around
for
a
fitting
substitute
to
succeed
to
the
post
of
ambition
cyril
coveted
can
you
direct
me
to
any
quarter
william
ashley
was
now
standing
at
william
side
looking
at
him
as
he
went
over
the
gloves
left
by
cyril
he
saw
the
red
flush
mount
to
his
face
ashley
laid
his
hand
on
william
shoulder
and
spoke
in
low
tones
full
of
emotion
it
may
come
my
boy
my
almost
son
and
when
thomas
ashley
head
shall
be
low
in
the
grave
the
leading
manufacturer
of
this
city
may
be
william
halliburton
a
loud
rapping
at
the
door
with
a
thick
stick
interrupted
the
words
he
turned
to
behold
dare
it
appeared
that
cyril
had
by
chance
met
his
father
in
the
street
almost
immediately
after
going
out
he
had
volunteered
to
him
a
most
exaggerated
account
and
dare
had
come
as
he
said
to
learn
the
rights
of
it
william
left
the
room
he
could
not
avoid
remarking
the
bowed
broken
appearance
of
the
man
ashley
related
the
particulars
and
the
listener
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
cyril
had
been
to
blame
had
been
too
hasty
i
confess
it
appears
so
he
said
he
must
have
been
led
away
by
temper
but
ashley
you
ought
to
stretch
a
point
and
make
a
concession
we
are
kinsmen
what
concession
discharge
william
halliburton
things
can
never
go
on
smoothly
between
him
and
cyril
stretch
a
point
to
oblige
us
and
send
him
away
discharge
william
halliburton
echoed
ashley
in
surprise
i
could
as
soon
discharge
myself
william
is
the
right
hand
of
the
business
it
could
go
on
without
me
but
i
am
not
sure
that
it
could
do
so
without
him
cyril
can
take
his
place
cyril
is
not
qualified
for
it
and
cyril
declares
he
will
never
enter
the
place
again
so
long
as
halliburton
is
in
it
cyril
never
will
enter
it
again
quietly
rejoined
ashley
cyril
and
i
have
parted
i
will
give
you
his
wages
for
this
week
now
that
you
are
here
legally
though
he
could
not
claim
them
dare
looked
sad
gloomy
it
was
only
what
he
had
expected
for
some
time
past
you
promised
to
do
well
by
him
ashley
to
take
him
into
partnership
you
must
surely
remember
that
i
promised
nothing
of
the
sort
said
ashley
i
have
been
telling
the
same
thing
to
cyril
all
i
said
and
a
shrewd
business
man
as
you
are
could
not
fail
thoroughly
to
understand
me
he
pointedly
added
was
that
i
would
choose
cyril
in
preference
to
others
provided
he
proved
himself
worthy
of
the
preference
circumstances
appear
to
have
worked
entirely
against
carrying
out
that
idea
mr
dare
what
circumstances
ashley
did
not
immediately
reply
and
the
question
was
repeated
in
a
hasty
almost
an
imperative
tone
then
ashley
answered
it
i
do
not
wish
to
say
a
word
that
should
unnecessarily
hurt
your
feelings
but
in
a
matter
of
business
i
believe
there
is
no
resource
but
to
speak
plainly
the
unfortunate
notoriety
acquired
in
one
way
or
other
by
your
sons
has
rendered
the
name
of
dare
so
conspicuous
that
were
there
no
other
reason
it
could
never
be
associated
with
mine
conspicuous
how
interposed
dare
ashley
would
not
have
believed
the
words
were
uttered
as
a
question
but
that
the
answer
was
evidently
waited
for
you
ask
he
said
surely
i
need
not
remind
you
the
scandal
which
in
more
ways
than
one
attached
to
anthony
though
i
am
sorry
to
allude
to
him
poor
fellow
in
any
such
way
the
circumstances
attending
the
trial
of
herbert
the
herbert
was
innocent
interrupted
dare
innocent
of
the
murder
no
doubt
as
innocent
as
you
or
i
but
people
made
free
with
his
name
in
other
ways
had
often
made
free
with
it
and
look
at
this
last
report
wafted
over
to
us
from
germany
that
is
just
now
astonishing
the
city
hang
him
for
a
simpleton
burst
forth
dare
it
is
all
so
much
discredit
to
the
name
to
the
family
altogether
concluded
ashley
as
if
his
sentence
had
not
been
interrupted
the
faults
of
his
brothers
ought
to
be
no
good
reason
for
your
rejecting
cyril
they
are
not
my
reason
for
rejecting
him
quietly
returned
ashley
no
you
have
just
said
they
were
i
said
the
notoriety
given
by
your
sons
to
the
name
of
dare
would
bar
its
association
with
mine
in
saying
sons
i
included
cyril
himself
interposes
the
greatest
barrier
of
all
were
the
rest
of
them
of
good
report
in
the
sight
of
day
cyril
is
not
so
what
the
matter
with
him
asked
dare
i
do
not
care
to
tell
you
a
great
deal
of
it
you
must
know
go
on
cried
anthony
dare
who
was
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
his
chin
resting
on
his
stick
as
one
who
sets
himself
calmly
to
hear
the
whole
cyril
private
conduct
is
bad
he
follies
of
youth
only
cried
old
anthony
he
will
outlive
them
youth
follies
sometimes
end
in
manhood
crimes
was
the
reply
i
am
thankful
that
my
son
is
free
from
them
your
son
returned
anthony
dare
coughing
down
his
slighting
tone
your
son
is
one
apart
he
has
not
the
health
to
be
knocking
about
if
young
men
are
worth
anything
they
are
sure
to
be
a
bit
wild
a
frown
passed
over
the
master
brow
you
are
mistaken
dare
young
men
who
are
worth
anything
keep
themselves
from
such
folly
opinions
have
taken
a
turn
society
is
becoming
more
sensible
of
the
world
increased
enlightenment
and
ill
conduct
although
its
pursuer
may
be
a
fashionable
young
man
is
beginning
to
be
called
by
its
right
name
would
you
believe
that
cyril
has
more
than
once
come
here
i
hesitate
to
say
the
word
it
is
so
ugly
a
one
drunk
drunk
mr
dare
no
he
has
then
he
must
have
been
a
fool
for
his
pains
was
the
angry
retort
of
old
anthony
he
is
untruthful
he
is
idle
he
is
deceitful
but
i
do
not
i
say
care
to
go
into
this
were
you
cognizant
of
the
application
cyril
made
to
me
yesterday
respecting
my
daughter
i
do
know
of
any
application
he
did
me
the
honour
to
make
her
an
offer
of
marriage
old
anthony
lifted
his
head
sharply
not
speaking
the
master
continued
he
said
yesterday
that
he
was
acting
by
your
advice
he
repeated
that
you
and
dare
had
led
him
to
look
to
mary
well
returned
dare
but
i
did
not
know
he
had
spoken
how
could
you
excuse
me
i
again
say
if
i
am
to
speak
plainly
how
could
you
ever
have
entertained
so
wild
an
idea
perhaps
you
would
like
to
call
it
a
presumptuous
one
chafed
dare
i
do
call
it
so
returned
ashley
it
can
be
regarded
as
nothing
less
any
impartial
person
would
tell
you
so
i
put
out
of
the
discussion
altogether
the
want
of
means
on
the
part
of
cyril
i
speak
of
its
suitability
that
cyril
should
have
aspired
to
an
alliance
with
mary
ashley
was
presumption
in
the
highest
degree
it
has
displeased
me
very
much
and
henry
looks
upon
it
in
the
light
of
an
insult
who
henry
scornfully
returned
dare
a
dreamy
hypochondriac
pray
is
cyril
not
as
well
born
as
mary
ashley
has
he
been
as
well
reared
is
he
proving
that
he
has
been
a
conduct
is
of
far
more
importance
than
his
birth
it
would
seem
that
you
care
little
about
birth
or
rearing
either
or
you
would
not
exalt
halliburton
to
a
level
with
yourself
the
master
fixed
his
expressive
eyes
on
anthony
dare
birth
is
at
any
rate
as
good
as
your
family
and
mine
his
mother
and
your
wife
father
were
brother
and
sister
old
anthony
looked
taken
by
surprise
i
do
know
anything
about
it
said
he
somewhat
roughly
i
know
a
little
of
how
he
has
been
bred
he
and
his
brothers
so
do
i
said
ashley
i
wish
a
few
more
in
the
world
had
been
bred
in
the
same
way
why
they
have
been
bred
to
work
exclaimed
old
anthony
in
astonishment
they
have
not
been
bred
as
gentlemen
they
have
not
had
enough
to
eat
the
concluding
sentence
elicited
an
involuntary
laugh
from
the
master
at
any
rate
the
want
does
not
appear
to
have
stinted
their
growth
or
injured
them
in
a
physical
point
of
view
he
rejoined
a
touch
of
sarcasm
in
his
tone
they
are
men
and
dare
they
are
whether
they
have
been
bred
as
such
or
not
gentlemen
in
looks
in
manners
and
in
mind
and
heart
i
do
care
what
they
are
again
repeated
old
anthony
i
did
not
come
here
to
talk
about
them
but
about
cyril
your
exalting
halliburton
into
the
general
favour
that
ought
legitimately
to
have
been
cyril
is
a
piece
of
injustice
cyril
says
you
have
this
morning
announced
publicly
that
halliburton
is
master
under
you
it
is
flagrant
injustice
no
man
living
has
ever
had
cause
to
tax
me
with
injustice
impressively
answered
thomas
ashley
i
have
been
far
more
just
to
cyril
than
he
deserves
stay
is
a
wrong
word
i
have
been
far
more
to
him
shall
i
tell
you
that
i
have
kept
him
on
here
out
of
compassion
in
the
hope
that
the
considerate
way
in
which
i
treated
him
might
be
an
inducement
to
him
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
discard
his
faults
i
would
not
turn
him
away
to
be
a
town
talk
deep
down
within
the
archives
of
my
memory
my
own
sole
knowledge
i
buried
the
great
fault
of
which
he
was
guilty
here
he
was
young
and
i
would
not
take
from
him
his
fair
fame
on
the
very
threshold
of
his
commercial
life
great
fault
hesitated
dare
looking
half
frightened
thomas
ashley
inclined
his
head
and
lowered
his
voice
to
a
deeper
whisper
when
he
robbed
my
desk
of
the
cheque
i
fancy
your
own
suspicions
of
him
were
to
the
full
as
much
awakened
as
mine
there
was
no
reply
unless
a
groan
from
anthony
dare
could
be
called
one
his
hands
supporting
his
chin
rested
on
his
stick
still
ashley
resumed
i
became
convinced
though
not
in
the
first
blush
of
the
affair
that
the
transgressor
was
no
other
than
cyril
and
i
deliberated
what
my
course
should
be
natural
impulse
would
have
led
me
to
turn
him
away
if
not
to
prosecute
the
latter
would
scarcely
have
been
palatable
towards
one
of
my
wife
kindred
what
was
i
to
do
with
him
turn
him
adrift
without
a
character
and
a
character
that
would
get
him
any
other
situation
of
confidence
i
could
not
give
him
i
resolved
to
keep
him
on
for
his
own
sake
i
would
give
him
a
chance
of
redeeming
what
he
may
have
done
in
a
moment
thoughtless
temptation
i
spoke
to
him
privately
i
did
not
tell
him
in
so
many
words
that
i
knew
him
to
be
guilty
but
he
could
not
well
misunderstand
that
my
suspicions
were
awakened
i
told
him
his
conduct
had
not
been
good
not
such
that
i
could
approve
but
that
i
was
willing
for
his
own
sake
to
bury
the
past
in
silence
and
retain
him
as
a
last
chance
i
very
distinctly
warned
him
what
would
be
the
consequences
of
the
smallest
repetition
of
his
fault
that
no
consideration
for
myself
or
for
him
would
induce
me
to
look
over
it
a
second
time
thus
he
stayed
on
i
continually
giving
an
eye
to
his
conduct
and
taking
due
precautions
for
the
protection
of
my
property
and
keeping
fast
my
keys
james
meeking
received
my
orders
that
cyril
should
never
be
called
upon
to
help
pay
the
men
or
to
count
the
packets
of
halfpence
and
when
the
man
looked
wonderingly
at
me
in
return
i
casually
added
that
there
was
no
necessity
to
put
cyril
to
an
employment
he
particularly
disliked
while
he
could
call
upon
east
to
help
him
or
in
case
of
need
upon
halliburton
never
think
again
dare
that
i
have
been
unjust
to
your
son
if
i
have
erred
at
all
it
has
been
on
the
side
of
kindness
there
was
a
long
pause
anthony
dare
probably
was
feeling
the
kindness
in
spite
of
himself
what
have
you
had
to
complain
of
in
him
since
he
asked
not
of
any
more
robbery
but
of
his
general
conduct
a
great
deal
he
is
deceitful
he
has
appeared
here
in
the
state
i
have
hinted
to
you
he
is
incorrigibly
idle
he
probably
fancies
because
i
do
not
take
a
very
active
part
in
the
management
of
my
business
and
my
workpeople
that
i
sit
here
with
my
eyes
shut
seeing
little
and
knowing
less
of
what
goes
on
around
me
he
is
essentially
mistaken
i
am
cognizant
of
all
as
much
so
or
nearly
as
much
so
as
samuel
lynn
would
be
were
he
at
his
post
again
look
at
his
sorting
of
gloves
for
instance
the
very
thing
about
which
the
disturbance
occurred
just
now
cyril
sort
if
he
pleases
he
is
as
capable
of
sorting
them
properly
as
i
should
be
perhaps
more
so
but
he
does
not
do
it
and
every
dozen
he
attempts
to
make
up
has
to
be
done
over
again
in
point
of
fact
he
has
been
of
no
real
use
here
for
nothing
that
he
attempts
to
do
will
he
do
well
a
fitting
hand
to
fill
the
post
of
manager
taking
all
these
facts
into
consideration
added
the
master
you
will
not
be
surprised
that
an
offer
of
marriage
from
cyril
dare
to
my
daughter
bears
an
appearance
little
removed
from
insult
so
it
was
all
known
to
ashley
and
there
was
an
end
of
cyril
and
his
hopes
it
may
be
said
of
his
prospects
what
is
he
to
do
now
broke
from
the
lips
of
anthony
dare
indeed
i
do
not
know
unless
he
changes
his
habits
he
will
do
no
good
at
anything
wo
you
take
him
back
again
no
unequivocally
pronounced
ashley
he
has
left
of
his
own
accord
and
he
must
abide
by
it
stay
hear
me
out
were
i
to
allow
him
to
return
he
would
not
remain
here
a
week
i
am
certain
of
it
that
cyril
has
been
acting
a
part
to
beguile
me
of
my
favour
with
regard
to
those
foolish
hopes
of
his
there
is
no
doubt
the
hopes
gone
he
would
not
keep
up
even
the
semblance
of
good
conduct
neither
would
he
submit
to
the
rule
of
william
halliburton
it
is
best
as
it
is
he
is
gone
and
he
can
not
return
my
opinion
is
that
were
the
offer
of
return
made
to
him
he
would
reject
it
dare
opinion
was
not
far
different
although
he
had
pleaded
for
the
concession
then
you
will
not
make
him
your
partner
he
resumed
mr
dare
i
suppose
you
will
take
in
halliburton
it
is
very
probable
whoever
i
take
must
be
a
man
of
probity
and
honour
and
a
gentleman
he
added
with
a
stress
upon
the
word
william
halliburton
is
all
that
anthony
dare
rose
with
a
groan
he
could
contend
no
longer
my
sons
have
been
my
bane
he
uttered
from
between
his
bloodless
lips
i
wonder
sometimes
whether
they
were
born
bad
no
said
thomas
ashley
the
badness
has
come
with
their
training
chapter
xviii
called
and
now
there
occurs
another
gap
in
the
story
a
gap
of
years
and
we
have
entered
on
the
third
and
last
part
the
patient
of
the
halliburtons
was
approaching
fruition
their
struggles
were
over
and
they
were
ready
to
play
their
part
for
success
or
for
failure
in
the
great
drama
of
life
troubles
were
at
an
end
did
you
ever
remark
how
some
things
when
they
draw
towards
a
close
seem
to
advance
with
rapid
strides
unlike
the
slow
crawling
pace
that
characterized
their
beginning
life
in
its
childhood
its
youth
nay
in
its
middle
age
how
slowly
it
seems
to
pass
how
protracted
its
distinctive
periods
appear
to
be
but
when
old
age
approaches
then
time
moves
with
giant
strides
undertake
a
work
whether
of
the
hands
or
the
head
very
very
slow
does
the
progress
appear
to
be
until
it
is
far
advanced
and
then
the
conclusion
is
attained
fast
and
imperceptibly
thus
does
it
seem
to
be
in
the
history
of
the
young
halliburtons
to
them
the
race
may
have
been
tedious
the
labour
as
hard
at
the
close
of
their
preparatory
career
as
at
its
commencement
but
not
so
to
those
who
were
watching
them
there
has
not
been
space
to
trace
the
life
of
frank
and
gar
at
the
universities
to
record
word
by
word
how
they
bore
onward
with
unflinching
perseverance
looking
towards
the
goal
in
view
great
praise
was
due
to
them
and
they
won
it
from
those
who
knew
what
hard
work
meant
patiently
and
steadily
had
they
laboured
on
making
of
themselves
sound
and
brilliant
scholars
resisting
temptations
that
lead
so
many
astray
and
the
slights
and
mortifications
incidental
to
their
subordinate
position
i
take
it
all
out
when
i
am
lord
chancellor
of
england
frank
would
say
in
his
cheery
way
of
course
frank
had
always
intended
to
go
up
for
honours
and
of
course
frank
gained
them
he
went
to
oxford
as
a
humble
servitor
and
he
left
it
a
man
of
note
francis
halliburton
had
obtained
a
and
gained
his
fellowship
he
had
entered
himself
a
student
of
the
middle
temple
long
before
his
college
career
was
over
the
expenses
of
qualifying
for
the
bar
are
considerable
and
frank
fellowship
did
not
suffice
for
all
he
procured
literary
employment
writing
a
leading
article
for
one
of
the
daily
papers
and
contributing
to
sundry
reviews
gar
too
had
quitted
cambridge
with
unusual
credit
though
he
was
senior
wrangler
no
one
but
gar
perhaps
knew
that
he
had
aspired
to
that
proud
distinction
so
it
did
not
signify
a
more
solid
scholar
or
one
with
a
higher
character
in
the
best
sense
of
the
term
never
left
the
university
to
be
ordained
by
the
bishop
of
helstonleigh
or
by
any
other
prelate
on
the
bench
he
had
a
choice
of
a
title
to
orders
his
uncle
the
reverend
francis
tait
who
like
his
father
before
him
had
after
many
years
service
obtained
a
living
had
offered
gar
his
title
but
a
clergyman
in
the
county
of
helstonleigh
had
also
offered
him
one
and
gar
thanking
his
uncle
chose
helstonleigh
william
dream
of
ambition
was
fulfilled
the
dream
which
he
had
indulged
for
it
had
seemed
all
too
high
and
vague
for
possibility
he
was
ashley
partner
the
great
firm
in
helstonleigh
was
ashley
and
halliburton
ashley
and
halliburton
and
the
event
had
been
so
gradually
so
naturally
led
up
to
that
helstonleigh
was
not
surprised
when
it
was
announced
of
course
william
received
as
yet
only
a
small
share
of
the
profits
how
small
or
how
large
was
not
known
helstonleigh
racked
its
curiosity
to
learn
particulars
and
racked
it
in
vain
one
fact
was
assumed
beyond
doubt
that
a
portion
of
the
profits
was
secured
to
henry
in
the
event
of
ashley
death
william
was
now
virtually
sole
master
of
the
business
ashley
had
partially
retired
from
the
manufactory
at
least
his
visits
to
it
were
of
occurrence
so
rare
as
almost
to
amount
to
retirement
samuel
lynn
was
manager
as
of
old
william
had
assumed
ashley
place
and
desk
in
the
as
master
ashley
had
purchased
an
estate
deoffam
hall
some
two
to
three
miles
distant
from
the
city
close
to
the
little
village
of
deoffam
and
there
he
and
his
family
had
gone
to
reside
he
retained
his
old
house
in
the
london
road
and
they
would
visit
it
occasionally
and
pass
a
week
there
the
change
of
abode
did
not
appear
to
give
unqualified
gratification
to
henry
ashley
he
had
become
so
attached
to
william
that
he
could
not
bear
to
be
far
away
from
him
in
the
old
home
william
visits
had
been
daily
or
rather
nightly
in
this
he
did
see
him
so
often
william
contrived
to
go
over
twice
or
thrice
a
week
but
that
did
not
appear
to
be
often
enough
for
henry
mary
ashley
was
not
married
to
the
surprise
of
helstonleigh
but
mary
somewhat
obstinately
refused
to
leave
the
paternal
home
william
and
his
mother
lived
on
together
in
the
old
house
but
they
were
alone
now
for
he
could
afford
to
keep
up
its
expenses
and
he
had
insisted
upon
doing
so
insisted
that
she
who
had
worked
so
hard
for
them
should
have
rest
now
they
could
work
for
her
yes
they
had
all
worked
worked
on
for
the
end
and
gained
it
looking
back
jane
wondered
how
she
had
struggled
on
it
seemed
now
next
to
an
impossibility
that
she
could
have
done
it
verily
and
truly
she
believed
that
god
alone
had
borne
her
up
had
it
been
a
foreshadowing
of
what
was
to
come
when
her
father
years
back
had
warned
her
on
the
very
day
of
her
marriage
with
halliburton
had
been
decided
that
it
might
bring
many
troubles
upon
her
perhaps
so
one
thing
was
certain
that
it
had
brought
them
and
in
no
common
degree
but
the
troubles
were
surmounted
now
and
jane
boys
were
turned
out
just
as
well
as
though
she
had
had
thousands
a
year
to
bring
them
up
upon
perhaps
better
perhaps
better
how
full
of
force
is
the
suggestion
i
wonder
if
no
one
will
let
this
history
of
the
young
halliburtons
read
a
lesson
to
them
many
a
student
used
worse
by
fortune
and
the
world
than
he
thinks
he
deserves
might
take
it
to
himself
with
profit
do
not
let
it
be
flung
away
as
a
fancy
picture
endeavour
to
make
it
your
reality
a
career
worked
out
as
theirs
was
insures
success
as
a
necessity
ah
you
may
think
i
am
poor
i
ca
hope
to
achieve
such
things
poor
what
were
they
what
that
you
say
there
are
so
many
difficulties
in
the
way
quite
true
there
are
difficulties
in
the
way
of
attaining
most
things
worth
having
but
they
are
only
placed
there
to
be
overcome
like
the
hillocks
and
in
that
dream
that
came
to
halliburton
when
he
was
dying
they
are
placed
there
to
be
subdued
not
to
be
shunned
in
fear
or
turned
from
in
idleness
whatever
may
be
your
object
in
life
work
on
for
it
be
you
heir
to
a
dukedom
or
be
your
heritage
that
of
daily
toil
an
object
you
must
have
a
man
who
has
none
is
the
most
miserable
being
on
the
face
of
the
earth
bear
manfully
onward
and
attain
the
prize
toil
may
be
hard
but
it
will
grow
lighter
as
you
advance
impediments
may
be
disheartening
but
they
are
not
insurmountable
privations
may
be
painful
but
you
are
working
on
to
plenty
temptations
to
indolence
to
flagging
to
that
monster
sin
may
be
pulling
at
you
but
they
will
not
stir
you
from
your
path
an
inch
unless
you
choose
to
let
them
do
so
only
be
resolute
only
regard
trustingly
the
end
and
labour
for
it
and
it
will
surely
come
it
may
look
in
the
distance
so
far
off
that
the
very
hope
of
attaining
it
seems
but
a
chimera
never
mind
bear
hopefully
on
and
the
distance
will
lessen
palpably
with
every
step
no
real
good
was
ever
attained
to
in
this
world
without
working
for
it
no
real
good
as
i
honestly
believe
was
ever
gained
unless
god
blessing
went
with
the
endeavours
to
attain
it
a
friend
of
do
that
and
fight
your
way
on
doing
your
duty
and
you
will
find
the
goal
as
the
sons
of
halliburton
did
jane
was
sitting
alone
one
afternoon
in
her
parlour
she
was
little
changed
none
looking
at
her
could
believe
her
old
enough
to
be
the
mother
of
those
three
great
men
her
sons
not
that
gar
was
particularly
great
he
was
only
of
middle
height
jane
wore
a
shaded
silk
dress
and
her
hair
looked
as
smooth
and
abundant
as
in
the
old
days
of
her
girlhood
it
was
remarkable
how
little
her
past
troubles
had
told
upon
her
good
looks
how
little
she
was
aging
she
saw
the
postman
come
to
the
door
and
dobbs
brought
in
a
letter
it
frank
writing
growled
dobbs
jane
opened
it
and
found
that
frank
had
been
called
half
his
care
was
over
my
darling
mother
i
am
made
a
barrister
at
last
i
really
am
and
i
beg
you
will
all
receive
the
announcement
with
appropriate
awe
and
deference
i
was
called
and
i
intend
to
have
a
photograph
taken
of
myself
in
my
wig
and
gown
and
send
it
down
to
you
as
a
confirmation
of
the
fact
when
you
see
the
guy
the
wig
makes
of
me
you
will
say
you
never
saw
an
ugly
man
before
tell
dobbs
so
it
will
gladden
her
heart
do
you
remember
how
she
used
to
assure
us
when
boys
that
we
ought
to
be
put
under
a
glass
case
as
three
ultra
specimens
of
ugliness
i
shall
get
on
now
dearest
mother
it
may
be
a
little
work
at
first
but
there
no
fear
a
law
firm
has
promised
me
some
briefs
and
one
of
these
speedy
days
i
shall
inevitably
take
the
ears
of
some
court
by
storm
the
jury
struck
into
themselves
with
the
learned
counsel
astounding
eloquence
and
the
bar
dumb
and
then
my
fortune
made
i
need
not
tell
you
what
circuit
i
shall
patronize
or
in
how
short
a
time
afterwards
i
intend
to
be
leading
it
but
i
will
tell
you
that
my
first
object
in
life
when
i
am
up
in
the
world
shall
be
the
ease
and
comfort
of
my
dear
mother
william
is
not
going
to
do
everything
and
have
you
all
to
himself
talking
about
william
ask
him
if
he
can
not
get
up
some
chance
litigation
that
i
may
have
the
honour
of
appearing
for
him
next
assizes
i
do
it
all
free
for
nothing
ever
your
own
son
frank
jane
started
up
from
her
chair
at
the
news
almost
as
a
glad
child
who
could
she
find
to
share
it
with
her
she
ran
into
the
next
house
to
patience
patience
limped
a
little
in
her
walk
still
she
would
limp
always
anna
in
her
sober
quaker
cap
the
border
resting
on
her
fair
forehead
looked
up
from
her
drawing
and
jane
told
them
the
news
and
read
the
letter
that
is
nice
said
patience
it
must
be
a
weight
off
thy
mind
i
do
know
that
it
is
that
replied
jane
i
have
never
doubted
his
success
i
do
doubt
it
still
but
i
am
very
glad
i
wish
i
had
a
cause
to
try
cried
anna
who
had
recovered
all
her
old
spirits
and
her
love
of
chatter
i
would
let
frank
plead
it
for
me
will
you
come
back
with
me
anna
and
take
tea
said
jane
i
shall
be
alone
this
evening
william
is
going
over
to
deoffam
hall
i
come
replied
anna
beginning
to
put
up
her
pencils
with
alacrity
truth
to
say
she
was
just
as
fond
of
going
out
and
of
taking
off
her
cap
that
her
curls
might
fall
as
she
used
to
be
she
had
quite
recovered
caste
in
the
opinion
of
helstonleigh
in
fact
when
the
reaction
set
in
helstonleigh
had
been
rather
demonstrative
in
its
expression
of
repentance
for
having
taken
so
harsh
a
view
of
the
case
nevertheless
it
had
been
a
real
lesson
to
anna
and
had
rendered
her
more
sober
and
cautious
in
conduct
dobbs
was
standing
at
the
kitchen
door
as
they
went
in
dobbs
said
jane
in
the
gladness
of
her
heart
frank
is
called
called
responded
dobbs
staring
with
all
her
might
yes
he
was
called
yesterday
him
called
repeated
dobbs
evidently
doubting
the
fact
then
you
excuse
me
but
i
not
to
believe
it
it
a
deal
more
likely
he
gone
off
way
than
that
he
called
to
grace
anna
nearly
choked
with
laughter
jane
laughed
so
that
she
could
not
at
once
speak
oh
dobbs
i
do
mean
that
sort
of
calling
he
is
called
to
the
bar
he
has
become
a
barrister
oh
that
said
dobbs
ungraciously
much
good
may
it
do
him
he
wears
a
wig
and
gown
now
dobbs
put
in
anna
he
says
his
mother
is
to
tell
thee
that
it
makes
a
guy
of
him
and
so
gladden
thy
heart
ugh
grunted
dobbs
we
will
make
him
put
them
on
when
he
comes
down
wo
we
dobbs
if
thee
like
his
picture
in
them
he
send
it
thee
he
better
keep
it
retorted
dobbs
i
never
yet
saw
no
good
in
young
chaps
having
their
picturs
took
miss
anna
they
vain
enough
without
that
called
that
would
have
been
a
new
flight
for
chapter
xix
a
glimpse
of
a
blissful
dream
a
prettier
place
than
deoffam
hall
could
not
well
be
conceived
for
its
size
carping
people
would
add
well
it
was
not
so
large
as
windsor
castle
but
it
was
no
smaller
than
the
bishop
palace
at
helstonleigh
if
it
has
been
your
good
fortune
to
see
that
renowned
edifice
deoffam
hall
was
a
white
modern
villa
rising
in
the
midst
of
charming
grounds
grassy
lawns
smooth
as
velvet
winding
rivulets
groves
of
trees
affording
shelter
on
a
summer
day
on
the
terrace
before
the
windows
a
stately
peacock
was
fond
of
spreading
its
plumes
and
in
the
small
park
it
was
only
a
small
one
the
deer
rubbed
their
antlers
on
the
fine
old
trees
the
deer
and
the
peacock
were
the
especial
pets
of
henry
ashley
deoffam
itself
was
an
insignificant
village
a
few
gentlemen
houses
and
a
good
many
cottages
comprised
it
it
was
pleasantly
and
conveniently
situated
within
a
walk
of
helstonleigh
for
those
who
liked
walking
or
within
a
short
drive
but
desirable
as
it
was
as
a
residence
henry
ashley
was
rather
addicted
to
grumbling
at
it
he
would
often
wish
himself
back
in
his
old
home
one
lovely
morning
in
early
summer
when
they
were
assembled
together
discussing
plans
for
the
day
he
suddenly
broke
into
one
of
his
grumbling
humours
you
bought
deoffam
for
me
sir
he
was
beginning
but
i
bought
it
for
myself
and
your
mother
interposed
ashley
of
course
but
to
descend
to
me
afterwards
you
know
what
i
mean
i
have
made
up
my
mind
when
that
time
shall
come
to
send
gratitude
to
the
winds
and
sell
it
stuck
out
here
alone
with
the
peacock
you
and
the
mother
gone
i
should
i
do
like
to
outrage
your
feelings
by
saying
what
i
might
do
there
mary
said
ashley
mary
i
expect
she
have
gone
into
fresh
quarters
by
that
time
she
has
only
stopped
here
so
long
out
of
politeness
to
me
mary
lifted
her
eyes
a
smile
and
a
glow
on
her
bright
face
a
lovely
picture
she
in
her
delicate
summer
muslin
dress
i
tell
every
one
she
is
devoted
to
me
went
on
henry
in
his
quaint
fashion
strange
that
handsome
girl
mary
ashley
does
not
get
married
cries
helstonleigh
mary
my
dear
i
know
your
vanity
is
already
as
great
as
it
can
be
so
i
do
fear
to
increase
it
sister
get
married
i
say
to
them
she
she
has
resolved
to
make
a
noble
sacrifice
of
herself
for
my
sake
and
live
at
home
with
me
a
vestal
virgin
and
see
to
the
puddings
the
smile
left
mary
face
the
glow
remained
i
do
wish
you
would
not
talk
nonsense
henry
as
if
helstonleigh
troubled
itself
to
make
remarks
upon
me
it
is
not
so
rude
as
you
are
just
hark
at
her
returned
henry
helstonleigh
not
trouble
itself
to
make
remarks
when
you
know
the
town
was
up
in
arms
when
you
refused
sir
harry
marr
and
sent
him
packing
such
an
honour
had
never
fallen
to
its
luck
before
that
one
of
its
fair
citizens
born
and
bred
should
have
the
chance
of
becoming
a
real
live
my
lady
mary
was
cutting
a
pencil
at
the
moment
and
broke
the
point
off
papa
cried
she
turning
her
hot
face
to
his
ca
you
make
henry
talk
sense
if
he
must
talk
at
all
ashley
interposed
it
was
quite
true
that
mary
had
had
as
henry
phrased
it
a
chance
of
becoming
a
real
live
my
lady
and
there
lurked
in
ashley
heart
a
shadow
of
grievance
of
disappointment
that
she
should
have
refused
the
honour
she
spoke
rather
sharply
taking
henry
part
not
mary
henry
is
talking
nothing
but
sense
my
opinion
is
that
you
behaved
quite
rudely
to
sir
harry
it
is
an
offer
you
will
not
have
again
mary
still
added
ashley
subduing
her
tone
a
little
it
is
no
business
of
helstonleigh
neither
do
i
see
whence
the
town
could
have
derived
its
knowledge
as
if
any
news
could
be
stirring
good
or
bad
that
helstonleigh
does
not
ferret
its
way
to
returned
henry
my
belief
is
that
henry
went
and
told
retorted
mary
i
what
next
cried
henry
as
if
i
should
tell
of
the
graceless
doings
of
my
sister
it
is
bad
enough
to
lie
under
the
weighty
knowledge
one
self
and
as
if
i
should
ever
consent
to
marry
sir
harry
marr
returned
mary
with
a
touch
of
her
brother
spirit
mary
said
ashley
quietly
you
seemed
to
slip
out
of
that
business
and
of
all
questioning
over
it
as
smoothly
as
an
eel
i
never
came
to
the
bottom
of
it
what
was
your
objection
to
sir
harry
objection
papa
she
faltered
with
a
crimsoned
face
i
i
did
not
care
for
him
oh
that
was
it
was
it
returned
ashley
is
it
always
to
go
on
so
my
dear
asked
her
mother
poor
mary
was
in
sad
confusion
scarcely
knowing
whether
to
burst
into
anger
or
into
tears
what
do
you
mean
mamma
how
on
this
rejection
of
every
one
you
have
had
three
good
offers
not
counting
the
venture
of
cyril
dare
put
in
henry
and
you
say
to
all
concluded
ashley
i
fear
you
must
be
very
fastidious
and
she
growing
into
an
old
maid
and
be
quiet
henry
ca
you
leave
me
in
peace
my
dear
it
is
true
cried
henry
who
was
in
one
of
his
teasing
moods
of
course
i
have
not
kept
count
of
your
age
since
you
were
eighteen
it
would
be
polite
to
do
so
but
my
private
conviction
is
that
you
are
this
blessed
summer
if
i
were
answered
mary
i
would
marry
sir
harry
marr
i
am
not
to
marry
i
suppose
am
i
my
dear
no
one
said
you
were
said
henry
flinging
a
rose
at
her
which
he
took
from
his
but
do
you
see
that
this
brings
round
my
argument
that
you
have
resolved
to
make
yourself
a
noble
sisterly
sacrifice
and
stop
at
home
with
me
do
you
take
to
cats
yet
though
mary
thought
she
was
getting
the
worst
of
it
and
left
the
room
soon
afterwards
ashley
was
called
out
by
a
servant
did
you
receive
a
note
from
william
this
morning
sir
asked
henry
yes
replied
ashley
taking
it
from
his
pocket
he
mentions
in
it
that
there
is
a
report
in
the
town
that
herbert
dare
is
dead
herbert
dare
i
wonder
if
it
true
it
is
to
be
hoped
not
i
fear
he
was
not
very
fit
to
die
i
am
going
into
helstonleigh
and
shall
probably
hear
more
oh
are
you
going
in
sir
despatch
william
back
will
you
i
do
know
henry
they
may
be
busy
at
the
manufactory
if
so
i
am
sure
he
will
not
leave
it
what
a
blessing
if
that
manufactory
were
up
in
the
clouds
was
rejoinder
when
i
want
william
particularly
it
is
sure
to
be
that
manufactory
it
is
well
william
does
not
think
as
you
do
remarked
ashley
well
sir
he
must
certainly
think
samuel
lynn
a
nonentity
or
he
would
not
stick
himself
so
closely
to
business
you
never
applied
yourself
in
such
a
way
yes
i
did
but
you
must
please
to
remember
master
henry
that
the
cases
are
not
on
a
parallel
i
was
head
and
chief
of
all
accountable
to
none
had
i
chosen
to
take
a
twelvemonth
holiday
and
let
the
business
go
it
would
have
been
my
own
affair
exclusively
whether
the
business
went
right
or
whether
it
went
wrong
i
was
accountable
to
none
william
is
not
in
that
position
i
know
he
is
often
in
the
position
of
not
being
to
be
had
when
he
is
wanted
was
henry
reply
as
he
listlessly
turned
over
some
books
that
lay
on
the
table
will
you
go
into
town
with
me
i
could
not
stand
it
my
hip
is
giving
me
twinges
is
it
i
had
better
bring
back
parry
no
i
wo
have
him
unless
i
find
there
actual
need
the
mother
knows
what
to
do
with
me
i
do
suppose
it
will
come
to
anything
and
i
have
been
so
much
better
of
late
yes
you
have
although
you
quarrel
with
deoffam
it
is
the
change
to
it
the
air
of
the
place
that
has
renewed
your
health
you
ungrateful
boy
ashley
eyes
were
bent
lovingly
on
henry
as
he
said
it
henry
seized
his
father
hands
his
tone
exchanged
for
one
of
earnestness
not
ungrateful
sir
far
from
it
i
know
the
value
of
my
dear
father
that
a
kinder
or
a
better
one
son
could
not
possess
i
shall
grumble
on
to
my
life
end
it
is
my
amusement
but
the
grumbling
is
from
my
lips
only
not
from
my
fractious
spirit
as
it
was
in
days
gone
by
i
have
remarked
that
remarked
it
with
deep
thankfulness
you
have
acquired
a
victory
over
that
fractious
spirit
for
which
the
chief
thanks
are
due
to
william
halliburton
sir
it
is
so
but
for
him
most
probably
i
should
have
gone
a
discontented
wretch
to
the
let
me
be
poetical
for
once
silent
tomb
never
seeking
out
either
the
light
or
the
love
that
may
be
found
in
this
world
ashley
glanced
at
his
son
he
saw
that
he
was
contending
with
emotion
although
he
had
reassumed
his
bantering
tone
henry
what
light
what
love
the
light
and
the
love
that
a
man
may
take
into
his
own
spirit
he
william
told
me
years
ago
that
i
might
make
even
my
life
a
pleasant
and
a
useful
one
and
measureless
was
the
ridicule
i
gave
him
for
it
but
i
have
found
that
he
was
right
when
william
came
to
the
house
one
night
a
humble
sent
by
samuel
lynn
with
a
note
do
you
remember
it
sir
and
offered
to
help
me
dunce
that
i
was
with
my
latin
exercise
a
help
i
graciously
condescended
to
accept
we
little
thought
what
a
blessing
had
entered
the
dwelling
we
little
thought
what
a
brave
honest
indomitable
spirit
was
enshrined
in
the
humble
continued
ashley
he
has
got
on
as
he
deserved
he
will
be
a
worthy
successor
to
you
sir
a
second
thomas
ashley
a
far
better
one
than
i
should
ever
have
been
had
i
possessed
the
rudest
health
there
only
one
thing
more
for
william
to
gain
and
then
i
expect
he
will
be
at
rest
what
that
oh
it
no
concern
of
mine
sir
if
folks
ca
manage
for
themselves
they
need
not
come
to
me
to
help
them
ashley
looked
keenly
at
his
son
henry
passed
to
another
topic
do
send
him
here
sir
when
you
get
in
or
else
drive
him
back
with
you
i
shall
see
said
ashley
do
you
know
where
your
mother
went
to
after
some
domestic
catastrophe
i
expect
martha
came
to
the
door
with
a
face
as
green
as
the
peacock
tail
and
beckoned
her
out
the
best
come
to
grief
perhaps
ashley
rang
and
ordered
the
to
be
got
ready
one
bought
chiefly
for
henry
that
he
might
drive
into
town
before
he
started
he
came
across
mary
who
stood
at
one
of
the
corridor
windows
upstairs
and
had
evidently
been
crying
what
is
your
grief
mary
she
turned
to
the
sheltering
arm
open
to
her
and
tried
to
choke
the
tears
down
which
were
again
rising
i
wish
you
and
mamma
would
not
keep
so
angry
at
my
refusing
sir
harry
marr
who
told
you
i
was
angry
mary
oh
papa
i
fancied
so
this
morning
mamma
is
angry
about
it
and
it
pains
me
it
is
as
though
you
wanted
me
gone
my
dear
child
gone
for
our
comfort
i
should
wish
you
might
never
go
mary
but
for
your
own
it
may
be
different
i
do
not
wish
to
go
she
sobbed
i
want
to
stay
at
home
always
it
was
not
my
fault
papa
if
i
could
not
like
sir
harry
you
should
never
with
my
consent
marry
any
one
you
did
not
like
mary
not
if
it
were
the
greatest
match
in
the
three
kingdoms
why
this
distress
my
dear
mamma
vexation
will
blow
over
she
hoped
as
henry
tells
us
to
see
you
converted
into
a
live
my
lady
daughter
lady
marr
it
will
blow
over
child
mary
cried
in
silence
and
you
will
not
let
me
be
driven
away
papa
you
will
keep
me
at
home
always
ashley
shook
his
head
always
is
a
long
day
mary
some
one
may
be
coming
less
distasteful
than
sir
harry
marr
who
will
induce
you
to
leave
it
no
never
cried
she
somewhat
more
vehemently
than
the
case
seemed
to
warrant
should
any
one
be
asking
you
for
me
you
can
tell
them
at
once
do
not
trouble
to
bring
the
news
to
me
mary
yes
papa
no
matter
who
do
not
drive
me
away
from
you
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
she
stood
at
the
window
still
in
a
dreamy
attitude
and
watched
the
carriage
drive
off
with
ashley
presently
henry
passed
has
the
master
gone
do
you
know
mary
five
minutes
ago
i
hope
and
trust
he
send
back
william
it
was
striking
two
when
ashley
entered
the
manufactory
samuel
lynn
was
in
his
own
room
sorting
gloves
william
was
in
the
counting
house
seated
at
his
desk
his
now
formerly
ashley
the
very
desk
from
which
the
cheque
had
disappeared
but
william
took
a
more
active
part
in
the
general
management
than
ashley
had
ever
done
he
rose
shook
hands
with
the
master
and
placed
a
chair
for
him
the
master
still
he
was
called
indeed
he
actually
was
so
william
mr
halliburton
a
short
time
given
to
business
details
and
then
ashley
referred
to
the
report
of
herbert
dare
death
poor
herbert
dare
had
never
returned
from
abroad
and
it
was
to
be
feared
he
had
been
getting
lower
and
lower
in
the
scale
of
society
under
happier
auspices
and
with
different
training
herbert
might
have
made
a
happier
and
a
better
man
helstonleigh
did
not
know
how
he
lived
abroad
or
why
he
stayed
there
possibly
the
free
and
easy
continental
life
had
become
necessary
to
him
homburg
wiesbaden
wherever
there
were
there
might
be
found
herbert
dare
that
he
must
find
a
living
at
them
in
some
way
seemed
pretty
evident
it
was
a
great
pity
how
did
you
hear
that
he
was
dead
inquired
ashley
from
richard
winthorne
replied
william
i
met
him
yesterday
evening
in
guild
street
and
he
told
me
a
report
had
come
over
that
herbert
dare
had
died
of
fever
as
william
spoke
a
gentleman
entered
the
room
and
interrupted
them
a
captain
chambers
have
you
heard
that
herbert
dare
dead
was
his
first
greeting
is
it
certain
asked
ashley
i
do
know
report
says
it
is
certain
but
report
is
not
always
to
be
believed
how
that
family
has
gone
down
continued
captain
chambers
anthony
first
now
herbert
and
cyril
will
be
next
he
will
go
out
of
the
world
in
some
discreditable
way
a
wretched
scamp
shocking
habits
old
dare
too
unless
i
am
mistaken
is
on
his
last
legs
is
he
ill
inquired
ashley
no
no
worse
than
usual
but
i
never
saw
a
man
so
broken
i
alluded
to
the
legs
of
prosperity
talk
about
reports
though
and
captain
chambers
suddenly
wheeled
round
on
william
there
one
going
the
round
of
the
town
about
you
what
that
asked
william
not
that
i
am
dead
i
suppose
or
on
my
last
legs
something
better
that
you
are
going
to
marry
sophy
glenn
william
looked
all
amazement
an
amused
smile
stealing
over
his
lips
well
i
never
uttered
he
using
a
phrase
just
then
in
vogue
in
helstonleigh
what
has
put
that
into
the
town
head
you
should
best
know
that
said
captain
chambers
did
you
not
for
one
thing
beau
miss
sophy
to
a
concert
last
night
come
master
william
guilty
or
not
guilty
guilty
of
the
beauing
answered
william
i
called
on
the
glenns
yesterday
evening
and
found
them
starting
for
the
concert
so
i
accompanied
them
i
did
give
my
arm
to
sophy
and
whispered
the
sweet
words
you
be
my
charming
wife
no
that
i
did
not
said
william
laughing
and
i
dare
say
i
shall
never
whisper
them
to
any
woman
yet
born
if
it
will
give
helstonleigh
satisfaction
to
know
so
much
you
might
go
farther
and
fare
worse
than
in
taking
sophy
glenn
i
can
tell
you
that
master
william
returned
captain
chambers
remember
she
is
the
lucky
one
of
three
sisters
and
had
the
benignant
godmother
sophy
glenn
counts
five
thousand
pounds
to
her
fortune
when
captain
chambers
took
his
departure
ashley
looked
at
william
i
have
heard
henry
joke
you
about
the
glenn
girls
nice
little
girls
they
are
too
is
there
anything
in
it
william
sir
how
can
you
ask
such
a
thing
i
think
with
chambers
that
a
man
might
do
worse
than
marry
sophy
glenn
so
do
i
sir
but
i
shall
not
be
the
man
well
i
think
it
is
time
you
contemplated
something
of
the
sort
you
will
soon
be
thirty
years
of
age
yes
sir
but
i
do
not
intend
to
marry
why
not
asked
ashley
because
i
fear
my
wishes
would
lead
me
to
soar
too
high
that
is
i
i
mean
he
stopped
and
seemed
to
be
falling
into
inextricable
confusion
a
notable
thing
for
the
william
halliburton
do
you
mean
that
you
have
an
attachment
in
some
quarter
resumed
ashley
william
face
turned
fiery
red
i
can
not
deny
it
sir
he
answered
after
considerable
hesitation
and
that
she
is
above
your
reach
yes
in
what
manner
in
position
or
by
any
insurmountable
obstacle
i
suppose
she
is
not
some
one
else
wife
william
smiled
oh
no
in
position
shall
i
give
you
my
opinion
william
without
knowing
the
case
in
detail
william
was
standing
at
one
corner
of
the
his
arm
leaning
on
its
narrow
shelf
he
did
not
lift
his
eyes
yes
sir
if
you
please
then
i
think
there
is
scarcely
any
marriageable
girl
in
the
county
to
whom
you
might
not
aspire
and
in
time
win
oh
mr
ashley
is
it
the
daughter
of
the
william
laughed
is
it
the
bishop
daughter
william
shook
his
head
she
seems
to
be
quite
as
far
removed
from
me
come
i
must
know
who
is
it
it
is
impossible
that
i
can
tell
you
sir
i
must
know
i
do
think
i
have
ever
asked
you
in
vain
since
the
time
when
a
boy
you
confessed
your
thoughts
about
the
found
shilling
secrets
from
me
i
will
know
william
william
did
not
answer
the
upper
part
of
his
face
was
concealed
by
his
hand
but
ashley
marked
the
sweet
smile
that
played
around
his
mouth
come
i
will
help
you
is
it
the
charming
dobbs
amused
he
took
his
hand
from
his
face
well
sir
no
it
can
not
be
charlotte
east
because
she
is
married
william
seemed
as
impervious
as
ever
the
master
suddenly
laid
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
confronted
him
face
to
face
is
it
mary
ashley
the
burning
flush
of
scarlet
that
dyed
his
face
even
to
the
very
roots
of
his
hair
told
ashley
the
truth
far
more
effectually
than
words
could
have
done
there
ensued
a
pause
ashley
was
the
first
to
break
it
how
long
have
you
loved
her
for
years
has
been
the
wild
dream
of
my
aspirations
one
that
i
knew
would
never
be
realized
he
answered
suffering
his
eyes
to
meet
for
a
moment
ashley
have
you
spoken
to
her
of
it
never
or
led
her
to
believe
you
loved
her
no
sir
unless
my
looks
and
tones
may
have
betrayed
me
i
fear
they
have
but
it
was
not
intentionally
done
honest
in
this
as
in
all
else
thought
ashley
what
am
i
to
say
to
you
he
asked
aloud
i
do
not
know
sighed
william
i
expect
of
course
sir
that
you
will
forbid
me
deoffam
hall
but
i
can
still
meet
henry
at
the
house
in
town
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
he
added
in
an
impassioned
tone
i
could
not
help
loving
her
before
i
knew
what
my
new
feelings
meant
love
had
come
such
love
had
i
been
in
a
position
to
marry
her
i
would
have
made
her
life
one
dream
of
happiness
when
i
awoke
to
it
all
what
awoke
you
was
the
interruption
i
think
it
was
cyril
dare
asking
for
her
i
debated
with
myself
then
whether
i
ought
to
give
up
going
to
your
house
but
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
so
long
as
i
was
able
to
hide
my
feelings
from
her
i
need
not
banish
myself
my
judgment
was
wrong
i
know
but
the
temptation
to
see
her
occasionally
was
great
and
i
did
not
resist
it
and
so
you
continued
to
go
feeding
the
flame
yes
feeding
it
passionately
and
hopelessly
never
forgetting
that
the
pain
of
separation
must
come
did
you
hear
of
sir
harry
marr
offer
yes
i
heard
of
it
william
swept
his
hand
across
his
face
as
he
spoke
it
wore
a
expression
ashley
changed
his
tone
william
i
can
not
decide
this
matter
one
way
or
the
other
you
must
ask
mary
to
do
that
if
mary
chooses
to
favour
you
more
than
she
does
other
suitors
i
will
not
forbid
her
doing
it
only
this
very
day
she
begged
me
with
tears
to
keep
all
such
troublesome
customers
away
from
her
to
refuse
them
of
my
own
accord
but
it
strikes
me
that
you
may
as
well
have
an
answer
from
herself
william
his
whole
soul
in
his
eyes
was
gazing
at
ashley
he
could
not
tell
whether
he
might
believe
what
he
heard
whether
he
was
awake
or
dreaming
did
i
deliver
you
a
message
from
henry
no
sir
was
the
abstracted
response
he
wants
you
to
go
over
to
him
i
said
i
would
send
you
if
you
were
not
busy
he
is
not
very
well
but
ashley
did
you
mean
what
you
said
should
i
have
said
it
had
i
not
meant
it
was
the
quiet
answer
have
you
a
difficulty
in
believing
it
the
ingenuous
light
rose
to
william
eyes
as
he
raised
them
to
his
master
i
have
no
money
he
whispered
i
can
not
settle
a
farthing
upon
her
you
have
something
better
than
money
william
worth
and
i
can
make
settlements
go
and
hear
what
mary
says
you
will
catch
the
three
coach
if
you
make
haste
william
went
out
believing
still
that
he
must
be
in
a
trance
his
deeply
buried
dream
of
the
long
past
years
was
it
about
indeed
to
become
reality
but
in
the
midst
of
it
he
could
not
help
casting
a
thought
to
a
less
pleasing
subject
the
dares
herbert
was
young
to
die
he
was
no
doubt
unprepared
to
die
and
william
sincerely
hoped
that
the
report
would
prove
untrue
the
dares
were
going
down
sadly
in
the
social
scale
cyril
especially
he
was
just
what
captain
chambers
had
called
him
a
scamp
after
leaving
ashley
he
had
entered
his
father
office
as
a
temporary
thing
it
was
said
but
he
had
never
left
it
for
anything
else
a
great
deal
of
his
time
was
passed
in
george
whose
commission
never
came
had
gone
out
some
two
or
three
years
ago
to
sydney
his
sister
julia
and
her
husband
had
settled
there
and
they
had
found
an
opening
for
george
william
walked
on
thinking
of
the
dares
position
and
of
his
own
chapter
xx
ways
and
means
when
william
reached
deoffam
hall
he
found
henry
ashley
alone
lying
in
the
the
sofa
near
the
open
window
that
good
cried
he
good
of
the
master
for
sending
you
and
of
you
for
coming
you
do
look
well
observed
william
your
brow
has
the
old
lines
of
pain
in
it
thanks
to
my
hip
which
is
giving
me
threatening
twinges
what
this
report
about
dare
is
it
confirmed
not
absolutely
it
was
winthorne
told
me
captain
chambers
came
into
the
manufactory
and
spoke
of
it
this
afternoon
i
dare
say
it
true
said
henry
i
wonder
if
anna
lynn
will
put
on
weeds
for
him
he
sarcastically
added
quakers
do
wear
weeds
teach
your
grandmother
returned
henry
lapsing
into
one
of
those
free
popular
phrases
he
indulged
in
and
indulged
in
how
you
stare
at
me
do
you
think
i
am
not
ay
years
ago
you
have
no
objection
to
see
anna
marry
i
suppose
she
welcome
to
marry
for
me
you
may
go
and
propose
to
her
yourself
if
you
like
i
be
groomsman
at
the
wedding
would
the
alliance
give
you
pleasure
henry
laughed
you
deserve
hanging
in
chains
if
you
did
enter
upon
it
that
all
i
have
had
one
wife
assigned
to
me
remarked
william
whom
may
she
be
sophy
glenn
sophy
glenn
sophy
glenn
chambers
gravely
assured
me
that
helstonleigh
had
settled
the
match
he
chambers
considers
that
i
may
go
farther
and
fare
worse
ashley
said
the
same
but
what
do
say
cried
henry
rising
up
on
his
sofa
and
speaking
quite
sharply
i
oh
i
shall
consider
of
it
at
that
moment
mary
ashley
appeared
on
the
terrace
outside
a
small
basket
and
a
pair
of
scissors
in
her
hand
henry
called
to
her
are
you
going
to
cut
more
flowers
yes
mamma
has
sent
the
others
away
she
said
they
were
fading
seeing
william
there
she
nodded
to
him
her
colour
rising
i
say
mary
he
has
come
here
to
bring
some
news
went
on
henry
what
do
you
suppose
it
is
mamma
has
told
me
about
herbert
dare
not
that
he
is
going
to
make
himself
into
a
respectable
man
and
marry
sophy
glenn
he
came
here
to
announce
it
do
cut
too
much
of
that
syringa
its
sweetness
is
overpowering
in
a
room
mary
walked
away
william
felt
excessively
annoyed
you
are
more
dangerous
than
a
child
he
exclaimed
what
made
you
say
that
and
henry
like
a
true
child
fell
back
laughing
aloud
i
say
though
comrade
where
are
you
off
to
he
called
after
william
who
was
leaving
the
room
to
cut
the
flowers
for
your
sister
of
course
but
when
william
reached
mary
ashley
she
had
apparently
forgotten
her
errand
standing
in
a
dark
spot
against
the
trunk
of
the
acacia
tree
her
face
was
white
and
still
and
the
basket
lay
on
the
ground
she
picked
it
up
and
would
have
hastened
away
but
william
caught
her
hand
and
placed
it
within
his
arm
little
less
agitated
than
she
was
not
to
tell
him
that
news
he
whispered
i
did
indeed
come
here
hoping
to
solicit
one
to
be
my
wife
but
it
was
not
sophy
glenn
mary
you
can
not
mistake
what
my
feelings
have
long
been
but
papa
she
gasped
unable
to
control
her
emotion
he
looked
at
her
he
made
her
look
at
him
what
strange
happy
light
was
that
in
his
earnest
eyes
causing
her
heart
to
bound
ashley
sent
me
to
you
he
softly
whispered
henry
lay
and
waited
till
he
was
tired
no
william
no
mary
no
flowers
no
anything
had
they
both
gone
to
sleep
he
arose
and
taking
his
stick
limped
away
to
see
after
them
but
he
searched
the
in
vain
in
the
sheltered
shrubbery
pacing
it
leisurely
as
closely
together
as
they
could
well
be
linked
were
they
a
great
deal
too
much
occupied
with
each
other
to
pay
attention
to
anything
else
the
basket
lay
on
the
ground
empty
of
all
except
the
scissors
well
you
two
are
a
nice
lot
for
a
summer
day
began
henry
after
his
old
fashion
and
using
his
own
astonished
eyes
what
of
the
flowers
mary
would
have
flown
but
william
held
her
tightly
and
led
her
up
to
her
brother
he
strove
to
speak
jestingly
but
his
voice
betrayed
his
emotion
henry
shall
it
be
your
sister
or
sophy
glenn
so
you
have
been
settling
it
for
yourselves
have
you
i
would
not
be
in
your
shoes
miss
ashley
when
the
parental
thunderbolts
shall
descend
was
this
what
you
flung
sir
harry
over
for
there
never
was
any
accounting
for
taste
in
this
world
and
there
never
will
be
i
ask
you
where
the
flowers
are
and
i
should
like
an
answer
i
will
cut
them
now
said
william
will
you
come
he
asked
holding
out
his
arm
to
henry
no
replied
henry
sitting
down
on
the
shrubbery
bench
i
must
digest
this
shock
first
you
two
will
be
enough
to
cut
them
i
dare
say
they
walked
away
towards
the
but
ere
they
had
gone
many
steps
he
called
out
and
they
turned
mary
before
you
tie
yourself
up
irrevocably
i
hope
you
will
reflect
upon
the
ignominy
of
his
being
nothing
on
earth
but
a
manufacturer
a
pretty
come
down
that
for
the
lady
marr
who
might
have
been
he
was
in
one
of
his
most
ironical
moods
a
sure
sign
that
his
inward
state
was
that
of
glowing
satisfaction
this
had
been
his
hope
for
years
his
plan
it
may
be
said
but
he
had
kept
himself
silent
and
neutral
as
he
sat
there
ruminating
he
heard
the
distant
sound
of
the
pony
carriage
and
taking
a
short
cut
met
it
in
the
park
ashley
handed
the
reins
to
his
groom
got
out
and
gave
his
arm
to
henry
how
are
you
by
this
time
better
sir
nothing
much
to
brag
of
i
thought
william
would
have
been
with
you
is
he
not
come
yes
he
is
come
but
i
am
second
with
him
miss
mary
first
oh
indeed
returned
ashley
they
are
gone
off
somewhere
under
the
pretext
of
cutting
flowers
i
do
think
the
flowers
were
quite
the
object
though
he
stole
a
glance
at
his
father
as
he
spoke
but
he
gathered
nothing
and
he
dashed
at
once
into
the
subject
he
had
at
heart
father
you
will
not
stand
in
their
light
it
will
be
a
crushing
blow
to
both
if
you
do
let
him
have
her
there
not
a
man
in
the
world
half
as
worthy
but
still
ashley
made
no
rejoinder
henry
scarcely
gave
him
time
to
make
one
i
have
seen
it
a
long
time
i
have
seen
how
halliburton
kept
down
his
feelings
not
being
sure
of
the
ground
with
you
i
fear
that
they
must
have
overmastered
him
for
he
has
certainly
spoken
out
dear
father
do
make
two
of
the
best
spirits
in
the
world
miserable
by
withholding
your
consent
henry
said
ashley
turning
to
him
with
a
smile
do
you
fancy
william
halliburton
is
one
to
have
spoken
out
without
my
consent
henry
thin
cheek
flushed
did
you
give
it
him
have
you
already
given
it
him
i
gave
it
him
i
drew
from
him
the
fact
of
his
attachment
to
mary
not
telling
him
in
so
many
words
that
he
should
have
her
but
leaving
it
for
her
to
decide
then
it
will
be
for
i
have
seen
where
miss
mary
love
has
been
how
immeasurably
you
have
relieved
me
continued
henry
the
last
i
have
been
seeing
nothing
but
perplexity
and
guardians
have
you
returned
ashley
you
should
have
brought
a
little
common
sense
to
bear
upon
the
subject
henry
but
my
fear
was
sir
that
you
would
not
bring
the
common
sense
to
bear
freely
spoke
henry
you
do
not
quite
understand
me
had
i
entertained
an
insuperable
objection
to
mary
becoming
his
wife
do
you
suppose
i
should
have
been
so
wanting
in
prudence
and
forethought
as
to
have
allowed
opportunity
for
an
attachment
to
ripen
i
have
long
believed
that
there
was
no
man
within
the
circle
of
my
acquaintance
or
without
it
so
deserving
of
mary
except
in
fortune
therefore
i
suffered
him
to
come
here
with
my
eyes
open
as
to
what
might
be
the
result
a
very
probable
result
it
has
appeared
to
me
i
would
forgive
any
girl
who
fell
in
love
with
william
halliburton
and
what
about
ways
and
means
william
share
shall
be
increased
and
mary
will
not
go
to
him
dowerless
they
must
live
in
our
house
in
helstonleigh
and
when
we
want
to
go
there
we
must
be
their
guests
it
will
be
the
of
my
visions
said
henry
in
low
deep
tones
i
have
seen
them
in
it
in
fancy
in
that
very
house
and
myself
with
them
my
home
when
i
please
i
think
you
have
been
planning
for
me
as
much
as
for
them
not
exactly
henry
i
have
not
planned
i
have
only
let
things
take
their
course
it
will
be
happier
for
you
my
boy
than
if
she
had
gone
from
us
to
be
lady
marr
oh
if
ever
i
felt
inclined
to
smother
a
man
it
was
that
marr
i
never
you
know
brought
myself
to
be
decently
civil
to
him
there
no
answering
for
the
vanity
of
maidens
and
i
thought
it
just
possible
he
might
put
william
nose
out
of
joint
what
will
the
mother
say
the
mother
will
be
divided
said
ashley
a
smile
crossing
his
face
she
likes
william
but
she
likes
a
title
we
must
allow
her
a
day
or
two
to
get
over
it
i
will
go
and
give
her
the
tidings
now
if
mary
has
not
done
so
mary
is
with
her
lovier
returned
henry
she
ca
have
dragged
herself
away
from
him
yet
mary
however
was
not
with
her
lovier
as
ashley
crossed
the
hall
he
met
her
she
stopped
in
hesitation
and
coloured
vividly
well
mary
i
soon
sent
you
a
candidate
though
it
was
in
defiance
of
your
express
orders
did
i
do
right
mary
burst
into
tears
and
ashley
drew
her
face
to
him
may
god
bless
your
future
and
his
my
child
i
am
afraid
to
tell
mamma
she
sobbed
i
think
she
will
be
angry
i
could
not
help
liking
him
why
that
is
the
very
excuse
he
made
to
me
neither
can
i
help
liking
him
mary
i
will
tell
mamma
ashley
received
the
tidings
not
altogether
with
equanimity
as
ashley
had
surmised
she
was
divided
between
conflicting
opinions
she
liked
and
admired
william
but
she
equally
liked
and
admired
a
title
and
fortune
such
a
position
to
relinquish
the
union
with
sir
harry
had
she
married
sir
harry
we
should
have
lost
her
said
ashley
lost
her
to
be
sure
we
should
she
would
have
gone
to
her
new
home
twelve
miles
on
the
other
side
of
helstonleigh
amidst
her
new
connections
and
have
been
lost
to
us
excepting
for
a
formal
visit
now
and
then
as
it
is
we
shall
keep
her
at
her
old
home
yes
there
a
great
deal
to
be
said
on
both
sides
acknowledged
ashley
what
does
henry
say
that
he
thinks
i
have
been
planning
to
secure
his
happiness
had
mary
married
away
we
when
we
quit
this
scene
must
have
left
him
to
his
lonely
self
now
we
shall
leave
him
to
them
things
are
wisely
ordered
impressively
added
ashley
in
this
as
in
all
else
margaret
let
us
accept
them
and
be
grateful
ashley
went
to
seek
william
you
will
be
a
loving
husband
to
her
she
said
with
agitation
you
will
take
care
of
her
and
cherish
her
with
the
best
endeavours
of
my
whole
life
he
fervently
answered
as
he
took
ashley
hands
in
his
it
was
a
happy
group
that
evening
henry
lay
on
his
sofa
in
complacent
ease
mary
drawn
down
beside
him
and
william
leaning
over
the
back
of
it
while
and
ashley
sat
at
a
distance
partially
out
of
hearing
have
you
heard
what
the
master
says
asked
henry
he
thinks
you
have
been
getting
up
your
bargain
out
of
complaisance
to
me
you
are
aware
i
hope
william
that
whoever
takes
mary
must
take
me
i
am
perfectly
willing
it
is
well
you
are
and
do
you
know
where
you
are
to
live
william
shook
his
head
you
can
understand
how
all
these
future
considerations
have
weighed
me
down
he
said
glancing
at
mary
you
are
to
live
at
the
house
in
helstonleigh
it
to
be
converted
into
yours
by
some
patent
process
the
master
had
an
eye
to
this
i
know
when
he
declined
to
take
out
any
of
the
furniture
upon
our
removal
here
the
house
is
to
be
yours
and
the
run
of
it
is
to
be
mine
and
i
shall
grumble
away
to
my
heart
content
at
you
both
what
do
you
answer
to
that
william
i
do
ask
her
she
nobody
i
can
only
answer
that
the
more
you
run
into
it
the
better
pleased
we
shall
be
and
we
can
stand
any
extent
of
grumbling
i
am
glad
you
can
you
ought
to
by
this
time
for
you
have
been
pretty
well
seasoned
to
it
so
in
the
helstonleigh
house
remember
my
old
rooms
are
mine
and
i
intend
to
be
the
plague
of
your
lives
after
a
time
may
it
be
a
long
time
i
suppose
it
will
be
halliburton
of
deoffam
hall
what
nonsense
you
talk
henry
nonsense
i
shall
make
it
over
to
you
catch
me
sticking
myself
out
here
in
solitary
state
to
the
admiration
of
the
peacock
what
the
matter
with
you
now
you
two
oh
well
if
you
turn
up
your
noses
at
deoffam
it
shall
never
be
yours
i
leave
it
to
the
eldest
chickabiddy
and
mark
you
please
i
shall
have
him
named
and
stand
godfather
to
him
and
he
be
mine
and
not
yours
i
shall
do
just
as
i
like
with
the
whole
lot
if
they
count
a
score
and
spoil
them
as
much
as
i
choose
what
the
matter
there
exclaimed
ashley
perceiving
a
commotion
on
the
sofa
mary
succeeded
in
freeing
herself
and
went
away
with
a
crimsoned
face
mamma
i
think
henry
must
be
going
out
of
his
mind
he
is
talking
so
absurdly
absurdly
was
what
i
said
absurd
william
william
laughed
it
was
premature
at
any
rate
henry
stretched
up
his
hands
and
laid
hold
of
william
it
is
true
what
mary
says
that
i
must
be
going
out
of
my
mind
so
i
am
with
joy
but
the
report
of
herbert
dare
death
proved
to
be
a
false
one
chapter
xxi
the
dream
realized
the
approaching
marriage
of
william
halliburton
gave
rise
to
a
dispute
a
dispute
of
love
though
not
bitterness
frank
and
gar
contended
which
should
have
their
mother
william
no
longer
wanted
her
he
was
going
to
a
home
of
his
own
frank
wished
to
take
larger
chambers
where
she
would
find
sufficient
accommodation
he
urged
a
hundred
reasons
his
grievances
with
his
laundress
and
his
buttonless
shirts
gar
who
was
in
priest
orders
now
had
remained
in
that
same
first
curacy
at
a
hundred
a
year
and
the
parsonage
house
to
live
in
he
said
he
had
been
wanting
his
mother
all
along
and
could
not
do
without
her
jane
inclined
to
gar
she
said
she
had
an
idea
that
old
ladies
how
they
would
have
rebelled
at
hearing
her
call
herself
old
were
out
of
place
in
a
young
barrister
chambers
and
she
had
a
further
idea
that
chambers
were
comfortless
quarters
to
live
in
the
question
was
to
be
decided
when
they
met
at
william
wedding
frank
was
getting
on
well
better
than
the
ordinary
run
of
aspirants
he
had
come
through
helstonleigh
two
or
three
times
on
circuit
and
had
picked
up
odds
and
ends
of
briefs
there
meanwhile
william
took
possession
of
ashley
old
house
and
the
wedding
day
approached
besides
her
boys
jane
had
another
visitor
for
the
time
her
brother
francis
who
came
down
to
marry
them
perhaps
because
the
vicar
of
deoffam
had
recently
died
he
might
have
come
all
the
same
had
that
gouty
old
gentleman
been
still
alive
all
clear
and
cloudless
rose
the
september
sun
on
deoffam
never
a
brighter
sun
shone
on
a
wedding
it
was
a
quiet
wedding
only
a
few
guests
were
invited
to
it
mary
in
her
white
lace
robes
and
floating
veil
flushed
timid
lovely
stood
with
her
bridesmaids
not
more
lovely
than
one
of
those
bridesmaids
for
one
was
anna
lynn
anna
lynn
yes
anna
lynn
to
the
lasting
scandal
of
patience
anna
stood
in
the
open
church
dressed
in
bridesmaid
attire
mary
who
had
not
been
permitted
the
same
intimacy
with
anna
since
that
marked
and
unhappy
time
but
who
had
loved
her
all
along
had
been
allowed
by
ashley
to
choose
her
for
one
of
her
bridesmaids
the
invitation
was
proffered
and
samuel
lynn
did
not
see
reason
to
decline
it
patience
was
indignantly
rebellious
anna
wild
with
delight
look
at
her
as
she
stands
there
flowing
robes
of
white
around
her
not
made
after
the
primitive
fashion
of
robes
but
in
the
fashion
of
the
day
her
falling
hair
shades
her
carmine
cheeks
and
her
blue
eyes
seek
modestly
the
ground
a
fair
picture
and
a
dangerous
one
to
henry
ashley
had
those
old
feelings
of
his
remained
in
the
ascendant
but
he
was
cured
as
he
told
william
and
he
told
it
in
truth
a
short
time
and
anna
would
want
bridesmaids
on
her
own
account
though
that
may
be
speaking
metaphorically
of
a
quakeress
anna
pretty
face
had
pierced
the
heart
of
one
of
their
male
body
and
he
had
asked
for
anna
in
marriage
a
very
desirable
male
was
he
in
a
social
point
of
view
and
female
helstonleigh
turned
up
its
nose
in
envy
at
fortune
he
was
considerably
older
than
anna
a
man
and
a
wealthy
one
engaged
in
wholesale
business
his
name
was
gurney
his
residence
outside
the
city
was
a
handsome
one
replete
with
every
comfort
and
he
drove
a
he
had
been
for
some
time
a
visitor
at
samuel
lynn
and
anna
had
learned
to
like
him
that
his
object
in
visiting
there
could
only
be
anna
every
one
had
been
sure
of
his
position
being
so
superior
to
samuel
lynn
every
one
but
anna
somehow
since
that
past
escapade
anna
had
not
cast
a
thought
to
marrying
or
to
the
probability
of
anyone
asking
her
and
she
did
not
suspect
his
intentions
if
she
had
suspected
them
she
might
have
set
herself
against
him
for
there
was
a
little
spice
of
opposition
in
her
which
she
loved
to
indulge
however
before
that
suspicion
came
to
her
she
had
grown
to
care
for
him
too
much
to
play
the
coquette
strange
to
say
there
was
something
in
his
figure
and
in
the
outline
of
his
face
which
reminded
people
of
herbert
dare
but
his
features
and
their
expression
were
quite
different
it
was
a
most
excellent
match
for
anna
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
but
it
did
not
afford
complete
satisfaction
to
patience
patience
felt
a
foreboding
that
he
would
be
a
good
deal
more
indulgent
to
anna
than
she
considered
was
wholesomely
good
for
her
patience
had
a
misgiving
that
anna
would
be
putting
off
her
caps
as
she
chose
then
and
would
not
be
reprimanded
for
it
not
unlikely
could
that
future
bridegroom
charles
gurney
catch
sight
of
anna
as
she
stands
now
for
a
more
charming
picture
never
was
seen
william
quiet
and
received
mary
from
the
hands
of
her
father
who
gave
her
away
the
reverend
francis
tait
read
the
service
and
gar
in
his
white
canonicals
stood
with
him
after
the
new
fashion
of
the
day
jane
tears
dropped
on
her
damask
dress
frank
made
himself
very
busy
amongst
the
bridesmaids
and
henry
ashley
was
in
his
most
mocking
mood
thus
they
were
made
man
and
wife
and
voice
rose
high
and
echoed
down
the
aisles
of
the
little
old
church
at
deoffam
as
he
spoke
the
solemn
injunction
those
whom
god
hath
joined
together
let
no
man
put
asunder
helstonleigh
streets
were
lined
that
day
and
helstonleigh
windows
were
alive
with
heads
it
was
known
that
the
bride
and
bridegroom
would
pass
through
the
town
on
the
first
stage
of
their
bridal
tour
whose
ultimate
destination
was
to
be
the
continent
the
whole
crowd
of
the
ashley
workpeople
had
gathered
outside
the
manufactory
neglecting
their
afternoon
work
a
neglect
which
samuel
lynn
not
only
winked
at
but
participated
in
for
he
stood
with
them
as
the
carriage
which
was
ashley
came
in
sight
its
four
horses
urged
by
the
postillions
to
a
sharp
trot
one
deafening
cheer
arose
from
the
men
william
laughed
and
nodded
to
them
but
they
did
not
get
half
a
good
view
of
the
daughter
beside
him
nothing
but
a
glimpse
of
a
flushed
cheek
and
a
piece
of
a
white
veil
slouching
at
the
corner
of
a
street
in
a
seedy
coat
his
eyes
bloodshot
was
cyril
dare
never
did
one
look
more
of
a
than
he
as
he
watched
the
chariot
pass
the
place
now
occupied
by
william
might
have
been
his
had
he
so
willed
it
and
worked
for
it
not
perhaps
that
of
mary
husband
he
could
not
be
sure
of
that
but
as
ashley
partner
a
bitter
cloud
of
disappointment
of
repentance
crossed
his
face
as
he
looked
at
them
they
both
saw
him
standing
there
did
mary
think
what
a
promising
husband
he
would
have
made
her
cyril
flung
a
word
after
them
and
it
was
not
a
blessing
dobbs
had
also
flung
something
after
them
and
in
point
of
time
and
precedence
this
ought
to
have
been
mentioned
first
patience
watching
from
her
window
curious
as
every
one
else
had
seen
dobbs
come
out
with
something
under
her
apron
and
take
up
her
station
at
the
gate
where
she
waited
patiently
for
just
an
hour
and
a
quarter
as
the
carriage
had
come
into
view
dobbs
sheltered
herself
behind
the
shrubs
nothing
to
be
seen
of
her
above
them
but
her
cap
and
eyes
the
moment
the
carriage
was
past
out
flew
dobbs
to
the
middle
of
the
road
bringing
forth
from
their
a
pair
of
shoes
considerably
the
worse
for
wear
the
one
possessing
no
sole
and
the
other
no
upper
leather
dobbs
dashed
them
with
force
after
the
chariot
very
much
discomposing
the
manservant
in
the
rear
whose
head
they
struck
nothing
like
old
shoes
to
bring
luck
grunted
dobbs
to
patience
as
she
retired
indoors
i
never
knew
good
come
of
a
wedding
that
get
wish
them
luck
the
luck
of
a
safe
arrival
home
from
those
unpleasant
foreign
parts
emphatically
remarked
patience
who
had
found
her
residence
amongst
the
french
nothing
less
than
a
species
of
terrestrial
purgatory
chapter
xxii
the
bishop
letter
a
day
or
two
after
the
wedding
a
letter
was
delivered
at
halliburton
residence
addressed
to
gar
its
seal
a
mitre
prepared
gar
to
find
that
it
came
from
the
bishop
of
helstonleigh
its
contents
proved
to
be
a
mandate
commanding
his
attendance
the
following
morning
at
the
palace
at
nine
gar
turned
nervous
had
he
fallen
under
his
bishop
displeasure
and
was
about
to
be
reprimanded
tait
had
gone
back
to
london
gar
was
to
leave
on
the
following
day
saturday
frank
meant
to
stay
on
for
a
week
or
two
it
was
his
vacation
that
gar
all
over
cried
frank
who
had
perched
himself
on
a
side
table
gar
is
sure
to
look
to
the
dark
side
of
things
instead
of
the
bright
if
the
lord
chancellor
sent
for
me
i
should
set
it
down
that
my
fortune
was
about
to
be
made
his
lordship
going
to
present
you
with
a
living
gar
that
good
retorted
gar
what
interest
have
i
with
the
bishop
he
has
known
you
long
enough
as
he
has
many
others
if
the
bishop
interested
himself
for
all
the
clergymen
who
have
been
educated
at
helstonleigh
college
school
he
would
have
enough
upon
his
hands
i
expect
it
is
to
find
fault
with
me
for
some
unconscious
offence
go
it
gar
you
get
no
sleep
frank
i
must
say
the
note
appears
a
peremptory
one
remarked
jane
middling
for
that
it
short
if
not
sweet
whether
gar
had
any
sleep
or
not
that
night
he
did
not
say
but
he
started
to
keep
the
appointment
punctually
his
mother
and
frank
remained
together
and
jane
fell
into
a
bit
of
quiet
talk
over
the
breakfast
table
frank
said
she
i
am
often
uneasy
about
you
about
me
cried
frank
in
considerable
wonderment
if
you
were
to
go
wrong
i
know
what
the
temptations
of
a
london
life
must
be
especially
to
a
young
man
who
has
so
to
say
no
home
i
steer
clear
of
them
mother
darling
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
he
added
earnestly
do
you
think
we
could
ever
fall
away
from
such
training
as
yours
no
look
at
what
william
is
look
at
gar
and
for
myself
though
i
do
like
to
boast
i
assure
you
the
society
if
you
have
ever
heard
of
that
respected
body
might
hoist
me
on
a
pedestal
at
exeter
hall
as
their
choicest
model
you
do
like
my
joking
believe
me
then
in
all
seriousness
that
your
sons
will
never
fail
you
we
did
not
battle
on
in
our
duty
as
boys
to
forget
it
as
men
you
taught
us
the
bravest
lesson
that
a
mother
can
teach
or
a
child
learn
when
you
contrived
to
impress
upon
us
the
truth
that
god
is
our
witness
always
ever
present
jane
eyes
filled
with
tears
not
of
grief
she
knew
that
frank
was
speaking
from
his
heart
and
you
are
getting
on
well
what
with
stray
briefs
that
come
to
me
and
my
literary
work
and
the
fellowship
i
make
six
or
seven
hundred
a
year
already
i
hope
you
are
not
spending
it
all
that
i
am
not
i
put
by
all
i
can
it
is
true
that
i
do
live
upon
bread
and
potatoes
six
days
in
the
week
as
you
know
we
have
done
but
i
take
care
that
my
expenses
are
moderate
it
is
keeping
follies
at
that
enables
me
to
save
and
now
frank
for
another
question
what
made
you
send
me
that
note
i
shall
send
you
another
soon
was
all
frank
answer
the
idea
of
my
gaining
a
superfluity
of
money
and
sending
none
to
my
darling
mother
but
indeed
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
it
frank
i
do
not
require
it
then
put
it
by
to
look
at
as
long
as
i
have
brains
to
work
with
i
shall
think
of
my
mother
have
you
forgotten
how
she
worked
for
us
i
wish
you
would
come
and
live
with
me
jane
entered
into
all
her
arguments
for
deeming
that
she
should
be
better
with
gar
not
the
least
of
them
was
that
she
should
still
be
near
helstonleigh
of
all
her
sons
jane
perhaps
unconsciously
to
herself
most
loved
her
eldest
and
to
go
far
away
from
him
would
have
been
another
trouble
they
saw
gar
coming
back
and
he
did
not
look
as
if
he
had
been
receiving
a
reprimand
quite
the
contrary
he
came
in
almost
as
impulsively
as
he
used
to
do
in
his
schoolboy
days
frank
you
were
right
the
bishop
is
going
to
give
me
a
living
mother
it
is
true
of
course
said
frank
i
always
am
right
the
bishop
did
not
keep
me
waiting
a
minute
although
i
was
there
before
my
time
he
was
very
kind
and
but
about
the
living
cried
impatient
frank
i
am
telling
you
frank
the
bishop
said
he
had
watched
us
grow
up
meaning
you
as
well
and
he
felt
pleased
to
tell
me
that
he
had
never
seen
anything
but
good
in
either
of
us
but
i
need
not
repeat
all
that
he
went
on
to
ask
me
whether
i
should
be
prepared
to
do
my
duty
zealously
in
a
living
were
one
given
to
me
i
answered
that
i
hoped
i
should
and
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
that
i
am
going
to
be
appointed
to
one
long
live
the
bishop
cried
frank
where
the
living
situated
in
the
moon
ah
where
indeed
guess
what
living
it
is
mother
gar
dear
how
can
i
asked
jane
is
it
a
minor
canonry
they
both
laughed
it
recalled
jane
to
her
absence
of
mind
the
bishop
had
nothing
to
do
with
bestowing
the
minor
canonries
neither
could
a
minor
canonry
be
called
a
living
mother
it
is
deoffam
deoffam
oh
gar
yes
it
is
deoffam
you
will
not
have
to
go
far
away
from
helstonleigh
now
i
lay
my
court
wig
that
ashley
has
had
his
finger
in
the
pie
cried
quick
frank
but
in
point
of
fact
the
gift
had
emanated
from
the
prelate
himself
and
a
very
good
gift
it
was
four
hundred
a
year
and
the
prettiest
parsonage
house
within
ten
miles
the
brilliant
scholarship
of
the
halliburtons
attained
by
their
own
unflagging
industry
the
high
character
they
had
always
borne
had
not
been
lost
upon
the
bishop
of
helstonleigh
gar
conduct
as
a
clergyman
had
been
exemplary
preaching
was
of
no
mean
order
and
the
bishop
deemed
that
such
a
one
as
gar
ought
not
to
be
overlooked
the
day
has
gone
by
for
a
bishop
to
know
nothing
of
the
younger
clergy
of
his
diocese
and
he
of
helstonleigh
had
gar
halliburton
down
in
his
preferment
book
it
is
just
possible
that
the
announcement
of
his
name
in
the
local
papers
as
having
helped
to
marry
his
brother
at
deoffam
may
have
put
that
particular
living
into
the
bishop
head
certain
it
was
that
a
few
hours
after
the
bishop
read
it
he
ordered
his
carriage
and
went
to
pay
a
visit
at
deoffam
hall
during
his
stay
he
took
ashley
arm
and
drew
him
out
on
to
the
terrace
very
much
as
though
he
wished
to
take
a
nearer
view
of
the
peacock
i
have
been
thinking
ashley
of
bestowing
the
living
of
deoffam
upon
edgar
halliburton
what
should
you
say
to
it
that
i
should
almost
feel
it
as
a
personal
favour
paid
to
myself
was
the
reply
of
ashley
then
it
is
done
said
the
bishop
he
is
young
but
i
know
a
great
many
older
men
who
are
less
deserving
than
he
your
lordship
may
rely
upon
it
that
there
are
few
men
young
or
old
who
are
so
intrinsically
deserving
as
the
halliburtons
i
know
it
said
the
bishop
they
interested
me
as
lads
and
i
have
watched
them
ever
since
and
that
is
how
gar
became
vicar
of
deoffam
you
will
be
trying
for
a
minor
canonry
now
gar
i
suppose
living
so
near
to
it
observed
jane
halliburton
will
you
be
so
kind
as
not
to
put
unsuitable
notions
into
his
head
interrupted
frank
the
reverend
gar
must
look
out
for
a
canonry
not
a
minor
and
he
wo
stop
there
when
i
am
on
the
woolsack
in
my
place
in
the
lords
gar
may
be
opposite
to
me
a
spiritual
peer
jane
laughed
as
did
frank
who
knew
though
it
all
lay
in
the
future
chapter
xxiii
a
dying
confession
meanwhile
william
halliburton
and
his
wife
had
crossed
the
channel
amongst
other
letters
written
home
to
convey
news
of
them
was
the
following
it
was
written
by
mary
to
ashley
after
they
had
been
abroad
a
week
or
two
du
chapeau
my
ever
dear
mamma
you
have
heard
from
william
how
it
was
that
we
altered
our
intended
route
i
thought
the
so
delightful
that
i
was
unwilling
to
leave
it
even
for
paris
and
we
determined
to
remain
on
the
coast
especially
as
i
shall
have
other
opportunities
of
seeing
paris
with
william
boulogne
was
crowded
and
noisy
so
we
left
it
for
less
frequented
towns
staying
a
day
or
two
in
each
place
we
went
to
calais
and
to
gravelines
also
to
bourbourg
and
to
cassel
the
two
latter
on
the
coast
the
view
from
cassel
which
you
must
not
confound
with
cassel
in
germany
is
magnificent
we
met
some
english
people
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
and
they
told
us
the
english
called
it
the
malvern
of
france
i
am
not
sure
which
affords
the
finer
view
cassel
or
malvern
they
say
that
eighty
towns
or
villages
may
be
counted
from
it
but
i
can
not
say
that
we
made
out
anything
like
so
many
we
can
see
the
sea
in
the
far
distance
as
we
can
on
a
clear
day
catch
a
glimpse
from
malvern
of
the
bristol
channel
the
view
from
some
of
the
windows
of
the
hôtel
de
sauvage
was
so
beautiful
that
i
was
never
tired
of
looking
at
it
william
says
he
shall
show
me
better
views
when
he
takes
me
to
lyons
and
annonay
but
i
scarcely
think
it
possible
at
a
short
distance
rises
a
monastery
of
the
order
of
la
trappe
where
the
monks
never
speak
except
the
mori
when
they
meet
each
other
some
of
the
customs
of
the
hotel
were
primitive
they
gave
us
tablespoons
in
our
for
breakfast
from
cassel
we
came
to
dunkerque
and
are
staying
at
the
chapeau
rouge
the
only
large
hotel
in
the
place
the
other
large
hotel
was
made
into
a
convent
some
time
back
both
are
in
the
rue
des
capucins
it
is
a
fine
and
very
clean
old
fortified
town
with
a
statue
of
jean
bart
in
the
middle
of
the
place
place
jean
bart
it
is
called
and
the
market
is
held
in
it
on
wednesdays
and
saturdays
as
it
is
at
helstonleigh
such
a
crowded
scene
on
the
saturday
and
the
women
caps
quite
shine
in
the
sun
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
i
like
to
look
at
these
old
flemish
towns
by
moonlight
they
look
exactly
like
the
towns
you
are
familiar
with
in
old
pictures
there
is
a
large
basin
here
and
a
long
harbour
and
pier
one
english
lady
whom
we
met
at
the
table
said
she
had
never
been
to
the
end
of
the
pier
yet
and
she
had
lived
in
dunkerque
four
years
it
was
too
far
for
a
walk
she
said
the
country
round
is
flat
and
poor
and
the
lower
classes
mostly
speak
flemish
on
monday
we
went
by
barge
to
a
place
called
bergues
four
miles
off
it
was
market
day
there
and
the
barge
was
crowded
with
passengers
from
dunkerque
a
nice
old
town
with
a
fine
church
they
charged
us
only
five
sous
for
our
passage
but
i
must
leave
all
these
descriptions
until
i
return
home
and
come
to
what
i
have
chiefly
to
tell
you
there
is
a
piece
of
enclosed
ground
here
called
the
pare
on
the
previous
saturday
which
was
the
day
we
first
arrived
here
i
and
william
were
walking
through
it
and
sat
down
on
one
of
the
benches
facing
the
old
tower
i
was
rather
tired
having
been
to
the
end
of
the
pier
for
its
length
did
not
alarm
us
some
one
was
seated
at
the
other
end
of
the
bench
but
we
did
not
take
particular
notice
of
her
suddenly
she
turned
to
me
and
spoke
i
not
the
honour
of
seeing
miss
ashley
mamma
you
may
imagine
my
surprise
it
was
that
italian
governess
of
the
dares
mademoiselle
varsini
as
they
used
to
call
her
william
interposed
i
do
think
he
liked
her
speaking
to
me
i
suppose
he
thought
of
that
story
about
her
which
came
over
from
germany
he
rose
and
took
me
on
his
arm
to
move
away
miss
ashley
he
said
to
her
mrs
halliburton
but
william
anger
died
away
if
he
had
felt
any
when
he
saw
her
face
i
can
not
describe
to
you
how
fearfully
ill
she
looked
her
cheeks
were
white
and
drawn
and
hollow
her
eyes
were
sunk
within
a
dark
circle
and
her
lips
were
open
and
looked
black
you
ill
i
asked
her
am
so
ill
that
a
few
days
will
be
the
finish
of
me
she
answered
doctor
gave
me
to
the
falling
of
the
leaves
and
many
are
already
strewing
the
grass
in
less
than
a
week
time
from
this
i
shall
be
lower
than
they
are
herbert
dare
with
you
inquired
william
but
he
has
said
since
that
he
spoke
in
the
moment
impulse
had
he
taken
thought
he
would
not
have
put
the
question
he
is
not
with
me
she
answered
in
an
angry
tone
know
nothing
of
him
he
is
just
a
vagabond
on
the
face
of
the
earth
is
it
that
is
the
matter
with
you
william
asked
her
call
it
decay
she
answered
was
in
brussels
getting
my
living
by
daily
teaching
i
had
to
go
out
in
all
weathers
and
i
did
not
take
heed
to
the
colds
i
caught
i
suppose
they
settled
on
my
lungs
you
been
in
this
town
long
we
inquired
of
her
came
in
august
she
answered
belgian
doctor
said
if
i
had
a
change
it
might
do
something
for
me
and
i
came
here
it
was
the
same
to
me
where
i
went
but
it
did
me
harm
instead
of
good
i
grew
worse
directly
i
came
and
the
doctor
here
said
i
must
not
move
away
again
the
travelling
would
injure
me
what
mattered
it
as
good
die
here
as
elsewhere
that
she
had
death
written
plainly
in
her
face
was
evident
nevertheless
william
tried
to
say
a
word
of
hope
to
her
but
she
interrupted
him
no
recovery
for
me
i
am
sure
to
die
and
the
time
it
to
be
hoped
will
not
be
long
in
coming
or
my
money
will
not
hold
out
she
spoke
in
a
tone
shocking
to
hear
and
before
i
could
call
up
any
answer
she
turned
to
william
are
the
william
halli
i
never
could
say
the
name
who
was
at
ashley
with
cyril
dare
may
i
ask
where
you
have
descended
in
dunkerque
the
chapeau
rouge
replied
william
if
i
should
send
there
to
ask
you
to
come
and
speak
with
me
will
you
come
she
continued
have
something
that
i
should
like
to
tell
you
before
i
die
william
informed
her
that
we
should
remain
a
week
and
we
wished
her
good
morning
and
moved
away
into
another
walk
soon
afterwards
we
saw
a
sister
of
charity
one
of
those
who
go
about
nursing
the
sick
come
up
to
her
and
lead
her
away
she
could
scarcely
crawl
and
halted
to
take
breath
between
every
few
steps
this
i
have
told
you
was
last
saturday
this
evening
wednesday
just
as
we
were
rising
from
table
a
waiter
came
to
william
and
called
him
out
saying
he
was
wanted
it
proved
to
be
the
sister
of
charity
that
we
had
seen
in
the
park
she
told
william
that
madame
varsini
was
near
death
and
had
sent
her
for
him
so
william
went
with
her
and
i
have
been
writing
this
to
you
since
his
departure
it
is
now
ten
and
he
has
not
yet
returned
i
shall
keep
this
open
to
tell
you
what
she
wanted
with
him
i
can
not
imagine
past
eleven
william
has
come
in
he
thinks
she
will
not
live
over
and
i
have
kept
my
letter
open
for
nothing
for
william
will
not
tell
me
he
says
she
has
been
talking
to
him
about
herself
and
the
dares
but
that
the
tale
is
more
fit
for
papa
ears
than
for
yours
or
mine
my
sincerest
love
to
papa
and
henry
we
are
so
glad
gar
is
to
be
at
deoffam
and
believe
me
your
child
mary
halliburton
excuse
the
smear
i
had
nearly
put
ashley
this
meeting
described
in
mary
letter
must
have
been
one
of
those
remarkable
coincidences
that
sometimes
occur
during
a
lifetime
chance
encounters
they
are
sometimes
called
chance
had
william
and
his
wife
not
gone
to
dunkerque
and
they
went
there
by
accident
as
may
be
said
for
the
original
plan
had
been
to
spend
their
absence
in
paris
they
would
not
have
met
had
the
italian
lady
not
gone
to
dunkerque
when
ordered
change
and
she
chose
it
by
accident
she
said
they
would
not
have
met
but
somehow
both
parties
brought
there
and
they
did
meet
it
was
not
chance
that
led
them
there
when
william
went
out
with
the
sister
she
conducted
him
to
a
small
lodging
in
the
rue
nationale
a
street
not
far
from
the
hotel
the
accommodation
appeared
to
consist
of
a
small
and
a
signora
varsini
was
in
the
latter
dressed
in
a
and
sitting
in
an
supported
by
cushions
a
faded
possibly
the
very
one
she
had
worn
years
ago
the
night
of
the
death
of
anthony
dare
william
was
surprised
by
the
account
he
had
expected
to
find
her
in
bed
almost
in
the
last
extremity
but
hers
was
a
restless
spirit
she
was
evidently
weaker
and
her
breath
seemed
to
come
irregularly
william
sat
down
in
a
chair
opposite
to
her
he
could
not
see
very
much
of
her
face
for
the
small
lamp
on
the
table
had
a
green
shade
over
it
which
cast
its
gloom
on
the
room
the
sister
retired
to
the
and
closed
the
door
between
with
a
caution
madame
was
not
to
talk
much
for
a
few
moments
after
the
first
greeting
she
madame
kept
silence
then
she
spoke
in
english
i
should
not
have
known
you
i
never
saw
much
of
you
but
i
knew
miss
ashley
in
a
moment
you
must
have
prospered
well
yes
i
am
ashley
partner
so
that
is
what
cyril
dare
coveted
for
himself
miss
ashley
also
monsieur
cyril
said
i
sometimes
to
my
mind
the
one
nor
the
other
for
thee
where
is
he
cyril
he
is
at
home
doing
no
good
he
never
do
good
she
said
with
bitterness
he
herbert
own
brother
and
the
other
one
george
george
is
in
australia
he
has
a
chance
i
believe
of
doing
pretty
well
are
the
girls
married
no
not
adelaide
no
something
like
a
smile
curled
her
dark
and
fevered
lips
mademoiselle
adelaide
was
trying
after
that
vicomte
i
would
say
to
myself
as
i
did
by
cyril
no
vicomte
for
her
he
is
only
playing
his
game
does
he
go
there
now
lord
hawkesley
oh
no
all
intimacy
has
ceased
they
have
gone
down
have
they
not
they
are
very
poor
i
fear
they
are
poor
now
yes
they
have
very
much
gone
down
may
i
inquire
what
it
is
you
want
with
me
you
inquire
soon
she
answered
in
resentful
tones
do
you
fear
i
should
contaminate
you
as
you
feared
for
your
wife
on
saturday
if
i
can
aid
you
in
any
way
i
shall
be
happy
and
ready
to
do
so
was
william
answer
spoken
soothingly
i
think
you
are
very
the
doctor
was
here
this
afternoon
chère
said
he
will
about
end
it
you
are
too
weak
to
last
longer
the
inside
is
gone
did
he
speak
to
you
in
that
way
a
medical
man
he
is
aware
that
i
know
as
much
about
my
own
state
as
he
does
he
might
not
be
so
plain
with
all
his
patients
then
i
said
to
the
sister
me
up
and
make
the
bed
for
i
must
see
a
friend
and
i
sent
her
for
you
i
told
you
i
wanted
you
to
do
me
a
little
service
will
you
do
it
if
it
is
in
my
power
it
is
not
much
it
is
this
she
added
drawing
from
beneath
the
a
small
packet
sealed
and
stamped
looking
like
a
thick
letter
will
you
undertake
to
put
this
surely
in
the
post
after
i
am
dead
i
do
not
want
it
posted
before
certainly
i
will
he
answered
taking
it
from
her
hand
and
glancing
at
the
superscription
it
was
addressed
to
herbert
dare
at
dusseldorf
is
he
there
asked
william
that
was
his
address
the
last
i
heard
of
him
he
is
now
here
now
there
now
elsewhere
a
vagabond
as
i
told
you
on
the
face
of
the
earth
he
is
like
cain
she
vehemently
continued
cain
wandered
abroad
over
the
earth
never
finding
rest
so
does
herbert
dare
who
wonders
cain
killed
his
brother
what
did
do
william
lifted
his
eyes
to
her
face
as
much
of
it
as
might
be
distinguished
under
the
dark
shade
cast
by
the
lamp
that
she
appeared
to
be
in
a
very
demonstrative
state
of
resentment
against
herbert
dare
was
indisputable
he
did
not
kill
his
brother
at
any
rate
observed
william
i
fear
he
is
not
a
good
man
and
you
may
have
cause
to
know
that
more
conclusively
than
i
but
he
did
not
kill
his
brother
you
were
in
helstonleigh
at
the
time
mademoiselle
and
must
remember
that
he
was
cleared
added
william
falling
into
the
style
of
address
used
by
the
dares
then
i
say
he
did
kill
him
she
spoke
with
slow
distinctness
william
could
only
look
at
her
in
amazement
was
her
mind
wandering
she
sat
glaring
at
him
with
her
light
blue
eyes
so
glazed
yet
glistening
just
the
same
eyes
that
used
to
puzzle
old
anthony
dare
what
did
you
say
asked
william
i
say
that
herbert
dare
is
a
second
cain
she
answered
he
did
not
kill
anthony
repeated
william
he
could
not
have
killed
him
he
was
in
another
place
at
the
time
yes
with
that
puritan
child
in
the
dainty
dress
fit
attire
only
for
your
folles
in
what
you
call
the
place
bedlam
i
know
he
was
in
another
place
she
continued
and
she
appeared
to
be
growing
terribly
excited
between
passion
and
natural
emotion
then
what
are
you
speaking
of
asked
william
it
is
an
impossibility
that
herbert
could
have
killed
his
brother
he
caused
him
to
be
killed
william
felt
a
nameless
dread
creeping
over
him
what
do
you
mean
he
breathed
i
send
that
letter
which
you
have
taken
charge
of
to
herbert
the
bad
but
he
moves
about
from
place
to
place
and
it
may
never
reach
him
so
i
want
to
tell
you
in
substance
what
is
written
in
the
letter
that
you
may
repeat
it
to
him
when
you
come
across
him
he
may
be
going
back
to
helstonleigh
some
day
if
he
not
die
off
first
with
his
vagabond
life
was
it
not
said
there
once
that
he
was
dead
only
for
a
day
or
two
it
was
a
false
report
and
when
you
see
him
in
case
he
has
not
had
that
packet
you
will
tell
him
this
that
i
am
now
about
to
tell
you
what
is
its
nature
asked
william
will
you
promise
to
tell
him
not
until
i
first
hear
what
it
may
be
fearlessly
replied
william
intrust
it
to
me
if
you
will
and
i
will
keep
it
sacred
but
i
must
use
my
own
judgment
as
to
imparting
it
to
herbert
dare
it
may
be
something
that
would
be
better
left
unsaid
i
do
not
ask
you
to
keep
it
sacred
she
rejoined
you
may
tell
it
to
the
world
if
you
please
you
may
tell
it
to
your
wife
you
may
tell
it
to
all
helstonleigh
but
not
until
i
am
dead
will
you
give
that
promise
that
i
will
readily
give
you
on
your
honour
william
truthful
eyes
smiled
into
hers
on
my
honour
if
that
shall
better
satisfy
you
it
was
not
necessary
she
remained
silent
a
few
moments
and
then
burst
forth
vehemently
when
you
see
him
that
cochon
that
vaurien
i
beg
you
to
be
calm
interrupted
william
this
excitement
must
be
most
injurious
to
one
in
your
weak
state
i
can
not
sit
and
listen
to
it
tell
him
said
she
leaning
forward
and
speaking
in
a
somewhat
calmer
tone
tell
him
that
it
was
he
who
caused
the
death
of
his
brother
anthony
william
could
only
look
at
her
was
she
wandering
killed
him
she
went
on
killed
him
in
mistake
for
monsieur
herbert
barely
had
the
words
left
her
lips
when
all
that
had
been
strange
in
that
past
tragedy
seamed
to
roll
away
as
a
cloud
from
william
mind
the
utter
mystery
there
had
been
as
to
the
perpetrator
the
almost
impossibility
of
pointing
accusation
to
any
seemed
now
accounted
for
and
a
conviction
that
she
was
speaking
the
dreadful
truth
fell
upon
him
involuntarily
he
recoiled
from
her
he
used
me
ill
yes
he
used
me
ill
that
wicked
herbert
she
continued
in
agitation
he
told
me
stories
he
was
false
to
me
he
mocked
at
me
he
had
made
me
care
for
him
i
cared
for
him
ah
i
not
tell
you
how
and
then
he
turned
round
to
laugh
at
me
he
had
but
amused
himself
pour
faire
passer
la
temps
her
voice
had
risen
to
a
shriek
her
face
and
lips
grew
ghastly
and
she
began
to
twitch
as
one
falling
into
convulsion
william
grew
alarmed
and
hastened
to
her
support
he
could
not
help
it
much
as
his
spirit
revolted
from
her
y
quelque
chose
peut
donner
à
madame
pour
la
soulager
he
called
out
hastily
to
the
sister
in
his
fear
the
woman
glided
in
mais
oui
monsieur
madame
pas
elle
beaucoup
the
sister
poured
some
drops
from
a
phial
into
a
of
water
and
held
it
to
those
quivering
lips
si
vous
vous
agitez
comme
cela
madame
pour
vous
tuer
cried
she
i
fear
so
too
added
william
in
english
to
the
invalid
it
would
be
better
for
me
not
to
hear
this
than
for
you
to
put
yourself
into
this
state
she
grew
calmer
and
the
sister
quitted
them
william
resumed
his
seat
as
before
there
appeared
to
be
no
help
for
it
and
she
continued
her
tale
i
not
agitate
myself
again
she
said
i
not
tell
you
all
the
details
or
what
i
suffered
à
quoi
bon
pain
at
morning
pain
at
midday
pain
at
night
i
think
my
heart
turned
dark
and
it
has
never
been
right
again
hush
mademoiselle
the
sister
will
hear
you
what
matter
she
not
speak
english
i
really
can
not
for
your
sake
remain
here
if
you
put
yourself
into
this
state
he
rejoined
you
must
remain
you
must
listen
you
have
promised
to
do
it
she
answered
i
will
if
you
will
be
calm
i
be
calm
she
rejoined
the
check
having
driven
back
the
rising
passion
the
worst
is
told
or
rather
i
do
not
tell
you
the
worst
that
mauvais
herbert
do
you
wonder
that
my
spirit
was
turned
to
revenge
perceiving
somewhat
of
her
fierce
and
fiery
nature
william
did
not
wonder
at
it
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
to
understand
yet
he
whispered
did
anthony
she
leaned
back
on
her
pillow
clasping
her
hands
before
her
ah
me
i
did
tell
him
so
she
continued
again
passionately
tell
him
that
i
killed
anthony
thinking
it
was
it
is
a
dreadful
story
shuddered
william
i
did
not
mean
it
to
be
so
dreadful
she
answered
speaking
quite
equably
no
i
did
not
and
i
am
telling
you
as
true
as
though
it
were
my
confession
before
receiving
the
i
only
meant
to
wound
him
herbert
herbert
of
course
who
else
but
herbert
she
retorted
giving
signs
of
another
relapse
had
i
cause
of
anger
against
that
pauvre
anthony
no
no
anthony
was
sharp
with
the
rest
sometimes
but
he
was
always
civil
to
me
i
never
had
a
with
him
i
not
like
cyril
but
i
not
dislike
george
and
anthony
why
why
she
continued
wringing
her
hands
did
anthony
come
forth
from
his
chamber
that
night
and
go
out
when
he
said
he
had
retired
to
it
for
good
that
is
where
all
the
evil
arose
not
all
dissented
william
in
low
tones
yes
all
she
sharply
repeated
i
had
only
meant
to
give
herbert
a
little
prick
in
the
dark
just
to
repay
him
to
stop
his
pleasant
visits
to
that
field
for
a
term
i
never
thought
to
kill
him
i
liked
him
better
than
that
ill
as
he
was
behaving
to
me
i
never
thought
to
kill
him
i
never
thought
much
to
hurt
him
and
it
would
not
have
hurt
anthony
but
that
he
was
what
you
call
tipsy
and
fell
on
the
point
of
the
scissors
suggested
william
for
she
had
stopped
how
could
he
even
with
this
confession
before
him
speak
to
a
lady
or
one
who
ought
to
have
been
a
lady
of
any
uglier
weapon
i
had
something
by
me
sharper
than
scissors
but
never
you
mind
what
that
so
far
does
not
matter
the
little
hurt
i
had
intended
for
herbert
he
escaped
and
poor
anthony
was
killed
there
was
a
long
pause
william
broke
it
speaking
out
his
thoughts
impulsively
and
yet
you
went
to
rotterdam
afterwards
to
make
friends
with
herbert
when
he
write
and
tell
me
there
good
teaching
in
the
place
could
i
know
it
was
untrue
could
i
know
that
he
would
borrow
all
my
money
from
me
could
i
know
that
he
turn
out
a
worse
mademoiselle
i
pray
you
be
calm
there
then
i
will
say
no
more
i
have
outlived
it
but
i
wish
him
to
know
that
that
fine
night
work
was
it
was
the
right
man
who
lay
in
prison
for
it
the
letter
i
have
given
you
may
never
reach
him
and
i
ask
you
tell
him
for
his
pill
should
it
not
then
you
have
never
hinted
this
to
him
asked
william
never
i
was
afraid
will
you
tell
him
i
can
not
make
the
promise
i
must
use
my
own
discretion
i
think
it
is
very
unlikely
that
i
shall
ever
see
him
you
meet
people
that
you
do
not
look
for
until
last
saturday
you
might
have
said
it
was
unlikely
that
you
would
meet
me
that
is
true
now
that
the
excitement
of
the
disclosure
was
over
she
lay
back
in
a
grievous
state
of
exhaustion
william
rose
to
leave
and
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
could
he
shun
it
guilty
as
she
had
confessed
herself
to
him
no
who
was
he
that
he
should
set
himself
up
to
judge
her
and
she
was
dying
can
nothing
be
done
to
alleviate
your
sufferings
he
inquired
in
a
kindly
tone
nothing
the
sooner
death
comes
to
release
me
from
them
the
better
he
lingered
yet
hesitating
then
he
bent
closer
to
her
and
spoke
in
a
whisper
have
you
thought
much
of
that
other
life
of
the
necessity
of
repentance
of
seeking
earnestly
the
pardon
of
god
that
is
your
protestant
fashion
she
answered
with
equanimity
i
have
made
my
confession
to
a
priest
and
he
has
given
me
absolution
a
good
fat
old
man
he
was
very
kind
to
me
he
saw
how
i
had
been
tossed
and
turned
about
in
life
he
will
bring
the
to
me
the
last
thing
and
cause
a
mass
to
be
said
for
my
soul
i
thought
i
had
heard
that
you
were
a
protestant
i
was
either
i
said
i
was
a
protestant
to
madame
dare
but
the
roman
catholic
religion
is
the
most
convenient
to
take
up
when
you
are
passing
priests
say
they
can
not
pardon
sins
the
interview
took
longer
in
acting
than
it
has
in
telling
and
william
returned
to
the
hotel
to
find
mary
tired
wondering
at
his
absence
and
a
letter
to
ashley
with
which
you
have
been
favoured
lying
on
the
table
awaiting
its
conclusion
you
are
weary
my
darling
you
should
not
have
remained
up
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
william
i
thought
you
must
have
gone
off
by
the
london
steamer
and
left
me
here
the
hotel
omnibus
took
some
passengers
to
it
at
ten
william
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
drew
her
to
him
the
full
tide
of
thankfulness
going
up
from
his
heart
that
all
women
were
not
as
the
one
he
had
just
left
and
what
did
mademoiselle
varsini
want
with
you
william
is
she
really
dying
i
think
she
is
dying
you
must
not
ask
me
what
she
wanted
mary
it
was
to
tell
me
something
to
speak
of
things
connected
with
herself
and
the
dares
they
would
not
be
pleasant
to
your
ears
but
i
have
been
writing
an
account
of
all
this
to
mamma
and
have
left
my
letter
open
to
send
word
what
the
governess
could
have
to
say
to
you
what
can
i
tell
her
tell
her
as
i
tell
you
my
dearest
that
what
i
have
been
listening
to
is
more
fit
for
ashley
ears
than
for
yours
or
hers
mary
rose
and
wrote
rapidly
the
concluding
lines
william
stood
and
watched
her
he
laughed
at
the
smear
i
am
not
familiar
with
my
new
name
yet
i
was
signing
myself
ashley
would
you
go
back
to
the
old
name
if
you
could
cried
he
somewhat
saucily
oh
william
saturday
came
round
again
the
day
they
were
to
leave
just
a
week
since
they
had
come
since
the
encounter
in
the
park
they
were
taking
an
early
walk
in
the
market
when
certain
low
sounds
as
of
chanting
struck
upon
their
ears
a
funeral
was
coming
along
it
had
just
turned
out
of
the
great
church
of
eloi
at
the
other
corner
of
the
place
not
a
wealthy
funeral
quite
the
other
thing
on
the
previous
day
they
had
seen
a
grand
interment
attended
by
its
distinguishing
marks
seven
or
eight
banners
as
many
priests
some
sudden
feeling
prompted
william
to
ask
whose
funeral
this
was
and
he
made
inquiry
of
a
shopkeeper
who
was
standing
at
her
door
monsieur
étrangère
une
italienne
dit
madame
varsini
oh
william
do
they
bury
her
already
was
mary
shocked
remonstrance
it
was
only
yesterday
at
midday
the
sister
came
to
you
to
say
she
had
died
what
a
shame
hush
love
many
of
the
people
here
understand
english
they
bury
quickly
in
these
countries
they
stood
on
the
pavement
and
the
funeral
came
quickly
on
one
black
banner
borne
aloft
in
a
man
hand
two
boys
in
surplices
with
lighted
candles
and
the
priest
chanting
with
his
open
book
eight
men
in
white
corded
hats
and
black
cloaks
bore
the
coffin
on
a
bier
and
there
was
a
sprinkling
of
impromptu
followers
as
there
always
is
at
these
foreign
funerals
as
the
dead
was
borne
past
him
on
its
way
to
the
cemetery
william
following
the
usage
of
the
country
lifted
his
hat
and
remained
uncovered
until
it
had
gone
by
and
that
was
the
last
of
bianca
varsini
chapter
xxiv
the
downfall
of
the
dares
it
was
a
winter
morning
and
the
family
party
round
the
breakfast
table
at
william
halliburton
looked
a
cheery
one
with
its
adjuncts
of
a
good
fire
and
good
fare
and
ashley
and
henry
were
guests
and
i
can
tell
you
that
in
ashley
they
were
entertaining
no
less
a
personage
than
the
high
sheriff
of
the
county
the
gentlemen
nominated
for
sheriffs
that
year
for
the
county
of
helstonleigh
whose
names
had
gone
up
to
the
queen
were
as
follows
humphrey
coldicott
esquire
of
coldicott
grange
sir
harry
marr
of
the
lynch
thomas
ashley
esquire
of
deoffam
hall
and
her
majesty
had
been
pleased
to
pick
the
latter
name
the
gate
of
the
garden
swung
open
and
some
one
came
hastily
round
the
to
the
house
mary
who
was
seated
at
the
head
of
the
table
facing
the
window
caught
a
view
of
the
visitor
it
is
mrs
dare
she
exclaimed
mrs
dare
repeated
ashley
as
a
peal
at
the
was
heard
nonsense
child
papa
indeed
it
is
i
think
you
must
be
mistaken
mary
said
her
husband
dare
would
scarcely
be
out
at
this
early
hour
oh
you
disbelievers
all
laughed
mary
as
if
i
did
not
know
dare
she
looked
scared
and
flurried
dare
looking
indeed
scared
and
flurried
came
into
the
the
servant
had
been
showing
her
into
another
room
but
she
put
him
aside
and
appeared
amidst
them
what
brought
her
there
what
had
she
come
to
tell
them
alas
of
their
unhappy
downfall
how
the
dares
had
contrived
to
go
on
so
long
without
the
crash
coming
they
alone
knew
they
had
promised
to
pay
here
they
had
promised
to
pay
there
and
people
tradespeople
especially
did
not
much
like
to
begin
compulsory
measures
with
old
anthony
dare
who
had
so
long
held
sway
in
helstonleigh
his
professional
business
had
almost
left
him
perhaps
because
there
was
no
efficient
head
to
carry
it
on
cyril
was
just
what
mademoiselle
had
called
herbert
a
vagabond
and
cyril
was
an
irretrievable
one
no
good
to
the
business
was
he
not
half
as
much
good
as
he
was
to
the
dare
with
white
hair
bent
form
and
dim
eyes
would
go
creeping
to
his
office
most
days
but
his
memory
was
leaving
him
and
it
was
evident
to
all
that
he
was
relapsing
into
his
second
childhood
latterly
they
had
lived
entirely
by
privately
disposing
of
their
portable
effects
as
honey
fair
used
to
do
when
it
fell
out
of
work
they
owed
money
everywhere
rent
taxes
servants
wages
large
debts
small
debts
it
was
universal
and
now
the
landlord
had
put
in
his
claim
after
the
manner
of
landlords
and
it
had
brought
on
the
climax
they
were
literally
without
resource
they
knew
not
where
to
turn
they
had
not
a
penny
or
the
worth
of
it
in
the
wide
world
dare
in
the
alarm
occasioned
by
the
unwelcome
visitor
for
the
landlord
man
had
made
good
his
entrance
that
morning
came
flying
off
to
ashley
some
extravagant
hope
floating
in
her
mind
that
help
might
be
obtained
from
him
here
trouble
here
trouble
she
exclaimed
by
way
of
salutation
wringing
her
hands
frantically
they
rose
in
consternation
believing
she
must
have
gone
wild
william
handed
her
a
chair
there
do
come
round
me
she
cried
as
she
flung
herself
into
it
go
on
with
your
breakfast
i
have
concealed
our
troubles
until
i
am
and
now
they
can
be
concealed
no
longer
and
i
have
come
for
help
to
you
do
press
anything
upon
me
william
halliburton
to
attempt
to
eat
would
choke
me
she
sat
there
and
entered
on
her
grievances
how
they
had
long
been
without
money
had
lived
by
credit
and
by
pledging
things
out
of
their
house
how
they
owed
more
than
she
could
tell
how
a
horrible
man
had
come
into
their
house
that
morning
as
an
emissary
of
the
landlord
what
are
we
to
do
she
wailed
will
you
help
us
ashley
will
you
your
wife
is
my
husband
cousin
you
know
halliburton
will
help
us
do
you
know
that
i
have
a
right
to
claim
kindred
with
you
your
father
and
i
were
first
cousins
and
lived
for
some
time
under
the
same
roof
william
remembered
the
former
years
when
she
had
not
been
so
ready
to
own
the
relationship
he
remembered
the
day
when
dare
had
put
a
seizure
into
their
house
and
his
mother
had
gone
craving
grace
of
him
ashley
remembered
it
and
his
eye
met
william
how
marvellously
had
the
change
been
brought
round
the
right
come
to
light
what
is
it
that
you
wish
me
to
do
inquired
ashley
i
do
not
understand
not
understand
she
sharply
echoed
in
her
grief
i
want
the
landlord
paid
out
you
have
ample
means
at
command
ashley
and
might
do
this
much
for
us
a
modest
request
certainly
the
rent
due
was
for
three
years
considerably
more
than
two
hundred
pounds
ashley
replied
to
it
quietly
a
moment
reflection
might
convince
you
dare
that
to
pay
this
money
would
be
fruitless
waste
the
instant
this
procedure
gets
wind
and
in
all
probability
it
has
already
done
so
other
claims
as
pressing
will
be
enforced
tradespeople
must
wait
she
answered
with
irritation
wait
for
what
asked
ashley
do
you
expect
to
drop
into
a
fortune
wait
for
what
indeed
for
complete
ruin
there
was
nothing
else
to
wait
for
dare
sat
beating
her
foot
against
the
carpet
dare
has
grown
useless
she
said
what
he
says
one
minute
he
forgets
the
next
he
is
almost
in
a
state
of
imbecility
i
have
no
one
to
consult
with
and
therefore
i
come
to
you
indeed
you
must
help
me
but
i
do
not
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
rejoined
ashley
as
to
paying
your
debts
it
is
it
is
in
fact
it
is
not
to
be
thought
of
i
have
my
own
payments
to
make
my
expenses
to
keep
up
i
could
not
do
it
mrs
dare
she
paused
again
playing
nervously
with
her
bonnet
strings
will
you
go
back
with
me
and
see
what
you
can
make
of
dare
perhaps
between
you
something
may
be
arranged
i
do
understand
things
i
can
not
go
back
with
you
replied
ashley
i
must
attend
the
meeting
which
takes
place
this
morning
at
the
guildhall
in
your
official
capacity
remarked
dare
in
not
at
all
a
pleasant
tone
of
voice
i
forgot
that
you
preside
at
it
how
very
grand
you
have
become
very
grand
indeed
i
think
considering
the
lowly
estimation
in
which
you
held
the
glove
manufacturer
thomas
ashley
he
answered
with
a
laugh
i
will
call
upon
your
husband
in
the
course
of
the
day
mrs
dare
she
turned
to
william
will
you
return
with
me
i
have
a
claim
on
you
she
reiterated
eagerly
he
shook
his
head
i
accompany
ashley
to
the
meeting
she
was
obliged
to
be
satisfied
turned
abruptly
and
left
the
room
william
attending
her
to
the
door
what
call
that
asked
henry
lifting
his
voice
for
the
first
time
call
it
repeated
his
sister
yes
mary
call
it
cheek
i
should
say
hush
henry
said
ashley
very
well
sir
it
cheek
all
the
same
though
as
ashley
surmised
the
misfortune
had
already
got
wind
and
the
unhappy
dares
were
besieged
that
day
by
clamorous
creditors
when
ashley
and
william
arrived
there
for
they
walked
up
at
the
conclusion
of
the
public
meeting
they
found
dare
seated
alone
in
the
that
sad
which
had
witnessed
the
tragical
end
of
anthony
he
cowered
over
the
fire
his
thin
hands
stretched
out
to
the
blaze
he
was
not
altogether
childish
but
his
memory
failed
and
he
was
apt
to
fall
into
fits
of
wandering
ashley
drew
forward
a
chair
and
sat
down
by
him
i
fear
things
do
not
look
very
bright
he
observed
we
called
in
at
your
office
as
we
came
by
and
found
a
seizure
was
also
put
in
there
there
nothing
much
for
to
take
but
the
desks
returned
old
anthony
dare
wished
me
to
come
and
talk
matters
over
with
you
to
see
whether
anything
could
be
done
she
does
not
understand
them
she
said
what
be
done
when
things
come
to
such
a
pass
as
this
returned
anthony
dare
lifting
his
head
sharply
that
just
like
women
what
to
be
done
i
am
beset
on
all
sides
if
the
bank
sent
me
a
present
of
three
or
four
thousand
pounds
we
might
go
on
again
but
it
wo
you
know
the
things
must
go
and
we
must
go
i
suppose
not
put
me
in
prison
they
get
nothing
by
doing
it
he
leaned
forward
and
rested
his
chin
on
his
stick
which
was
stretched
out
before
him
as
usual
presently
he
resumed
his
eyes
and
words
alike
wandering
he
said
the
money
would
not
bring
us
good
if
we
kept
it
and
it
has
not
it
has
brought
a
curse
i
have
told
julia
so
twenty
times
since
anthony
went
only
the
half
of
it
was
ours
you
know
and
we
took
the
whole
what
money
asked
ashley
wondering
what
he
was
saying
old
cooper
we
were
at
birmingham
when
he
died
i
and
julia
the
will
left
it
all
to
her
but
he
charged
us
dare
suddenly
stopped
his
eye
had
fallen
on
william
in
these
fits
of
wandering
he
partially
lost
his
memory
and
mixed
things
and
people
together
in
the
most
inextricable
confusion
are
you
edgar
halliburton
he
went
on
i
am
his
son
do
you
not
remember
me
mr
dare
ay
ay
your
nodding
to
ashley
but
cyril
was
to
have
had
that
place
you
know
he
was
to
have
been
your
partner
ashley
made
no
reply
it
might
not
have
been
understood
and
dare
resumed
confounding
william
with
his
father
it
was
hers
in
the
will
you
know
edgar
and
that
some
excuse
for
we
had
to
prove
it
there
was
not
time
to
alter
the
will
but
he
said
it
was
an
unjust
one
and
charged
us
to
divide
the
money
half
for
us
half
for
you
to
divide
it
to
the
last
halfpenny
and
we
took
it
all
we
did
not
mean
to
take
it
or
to
cheat
you
but
somehow
the
money
went
our
expenses
were
great
and
we
had
heavy
debts
and
when
you
came
afterwards
to
helstonleigh
and
died
your
share
was
already
broken
into
and
it
was
too
late
money
brings
nothing
but
a
curse
and
that
money
brought
it
to
us
will
you
shake
hands
and
forgive
heartily
replied
william
taking
his
wasted
hand
but
you
had
to
struggle
and
the
money
would
have
kept
struggle
from
you
it
was
many
thousands
who
knows
whether
it
would
or
not
cheerily
answered
william
had
we
possessed
money
to
fall
back
upon
we
might
not
have
struggled
with
a
will
we
might
not
have
put
out
all
the
exertion
that
was
in
us
and
then
we
should
never
have
got
on
as
we
have
done
ay
got
on
you
are
looked
up
to
now
you
have
become
gentlemen
and
what
are
my
boys
the
money
was
yours
dismiss
it
entirely
from
your
memory
dare
was
william
answer
given
in
true
compassion
i
believe
that
our
not
having
had
it
may
have
been
good
for
us
in
the
rather
than
a
drawback
the
utter
want
of
money
may
have
been
the
secret
of
our
success
ay
nodded
old
dare
my
boys
should
have
been
taught
to
work
and
they
were
only
taught
to
spend
we
must
have
our
luxuries
indoors
forsooth
and
our
show
without
our
servants
and
our
carriages
and
our
confounded
pride
what
has
it
ended
in
what
had
it
they
made
no
answer
dare
remained
still
for
a
while
and
then
lifted
his
haggard
face
and
spoke
in
a
whisper
a
shrinking
dread
in
his
face
and
tone
they
have
been
nothing
but
my
curses
it
was
through
herbert
that
she
that
wicked
foreign
woman
murdered
anthony
did
he
know
of
how
had
the
knowledge
come
to
him
william
had
not
betrayed
it
except
to
ashley
and
henry
and
they
had
buried
the
dreadful
secret
down
deep
in
the
archives
of
their
breasts
next
words
disclosed
the
puzzle
she
died
that
woman
and
she
wrote
to
herbert
on
her
and
made
a
confession
he
sent
a
part
of
it
on
here
lest
i
suppose
we
might
doubt
him
still
but
his
conduct
led
to
it
it
is
dreadful
to
have
such
sons
as
mine
his
stick
fell
to
the
ground
ashley
held
him
while
william
picked
it
up
he
was
gasping
for
breath
you
are
not
well
cried
ashley
no
i
think
i
am
going
one
ca
stand
these
repeated
shocks
did
i
see
edgar
halliburton
here
i
thought
he
was
dead
is
he
come
for
his
money
he
continued
in
a
shivering
whisper
we
acted
according
to
the
will
sir
according
to
the
will
tell
him
he
can
see
it
in
commons
he
ca
proceed
against
us
he
has
no
proof
let
him
go
and
look
at
the
will
we
had
better
leave
him
william
murmured
ashley
our
presence
only
excites
him
in
the
opposite
room
sat
dare
adelaide
passed
out
of
it
as
they
entered
never
before
had
they
remarked
how
sadly
worn
and
faded
she
looked
her
later
life
had
been
spent
in
pining
after
the
chance
of
greatness
she
had
lost
in
missing
viscount
hawkesley
irrevocably
lost
to
her
for
the
daughter
of
a
neighbouring
earl
now
called
him
husband
they
sat
down
by
dare
but
could
only
condole
with
her
nothing
but
the
most
irretrievable
ruin
was
around
we
shall
be
turned
from
here
she
wailed
how
are
we
to
find
a
home
to
earn
a
living
your
daughters
must
do
something
to
assist
you
replied
ashley
teaching
or
teaching
in
this
overdone
place
she
interrupted
it
has
been
somewhat
overdone
in
that
way
certainly
of
late
years
he
answered
if
they
can
not
get
teaching
they
may
find
some
other
employment
work
of
some
sort
work
shrieked
dare
my
daughters
indeed
i
do
know
what
else
is
to
be
done
he
answered
their
education
has
been
good
and
i
should
think
they
may
obtain
daily
teaching
perhaps
sufficient
to
enable
you
to
live
quietly
i
will
pay
for
a
lodging
for
you
and
give
you
a
trifle
towards
housekeeping
until
you
can
turn
yourselves
round
i
wish
we
were
all
dead
was
the
response
of
dare
ashley
went
a
little
nearer
to
her
what
is
this
story
that
your
husband
has
been
telling
about
the
misappropriation
of
the
money
that
cooper
desired
should
be
handed
to
edgar
halliburton
she
threw
her
hands
before
her
face
with
a
low
cry
has
he
been
betraying
what
will
become
of
us
what
shall
we
do
with
him
if
ever
a
family
was
beaten
down
by
fate
it
is
ours
not
gratuitously
by
fate
thought
ashley
its
own
misdoings
have
brought
the
evil
upon
it
where
is
cyril
he
asked
aloud
he
ought
to
bestir
himself
to
help
you
now
cyril
echoed
dare
a
bitter
scowl
rising
to
her
face
help
us
you
know
what
cyril
is
as
they
went
out
they
met
cyril
what
a
contrast
the
two
cousins
presented
side
by
side
he
and
william
might
be
called
such
the
one
fine
noble
intellectual
his
countenance
setting
forth
its
own
truth
candour
honour
making
the
best
in
his
walk
of
life
of
the
talents
entrusted
to
him
by
god
the
other
slouching
untidy
all
but
ragged
his
offensive
doings
too
plainly
shown
in
his
bloated
face
his
inflamed
eyes
letting
his
talents
and
his
days
run
to
worse
than
waste
a
burden
to
himself
and
to
those
around
him
and
yet
in
their
boyhood
days
how
great
had
been
cyril
advantages
over
william
halliburton
they
walked
away
william
and
ashley
a
short
visit
to
the
manufactory
in
passing
and
then
they
continued
their
way
home
taking
it
purposely
through
honey
fair
honey
fair
could
be
honey
fair
honey
fair
used
to
be
an
unsightly
inodorous
place
where
mud
garbage
and
children
ran
riot
together
a
species
in
short
of
capacious
pigsty
but
look
at
it
now
the
paths
are
well
kept
the
road
is
clean
and
cared
for
her
state
might
drive
down
it
and
the
horses
would
not
have
to
tread
gingerly
the
houses
are
the
same
small
and
large
bear
evidence
of
care
of
thrift
of
a
respectable
class
of
inmates
the
windows
are
no
longer
stuffed
with
rags
or
the
palings
broken
and
that
little
essay
the
assembling
at
robert
east
and
william
halliburton
had
led
to
the
change
men
and
women
had
been
awakened
to
to
the
duty
of
striving
to
live
well
and
to
do
well
to
the
solemn
thought
that
there
is
another
world
after
this
where
their
works
good
or
bad
would
follow
them
they
had
learned
to
reflect
that
it
be
possible
that
one
phase
of
a
lost
soul
punishment
after
death
will
lie
in
remembering
the
duties
it
ought
to
have
performed
in
life
they
knew
without
any
effort
of
reflection
that
it
is
a
remembrance
which
makes
the
sting
of
many
a
formerly
honey
fair
had
believed
those
who
had
thought
about
it
that
their
duties
in
this
world
and
any
duties
which
lay
in
preparing
for
the
next
were
as
wide
apart
as
the
two
poles
of
that
they
had
now
learned
the
fallacy
honey
fair
had
grown
serene
children
were
taken
out
of
the
streets
to
be
sent
to
school
the
bankes
had
been
discarded
for
the
women
had
grown
wiser
and
for
all
the
custom
the
horned
ram
obtained
from
honey
fair
it
might
have
shut
itself
up
in
short
honey
fair
had
been
awakened
speaking
from
a
moderate
point
of
view
to
enlightenment
to
the
social
improvements
of
an
advancing
and
a
thinking
age
this
was
a
grand
day
with
honey
fair
as
ashley
and
william
knew
when
they
turned
to
walk
through
it
ashley
had
purchased
that
building
you
have
heard
of
for
a
comparative
trifle
and
made
honey
fair
a
present
of
it
it
was
very
useful
it
did
for
their
schools
their
night
meetings
their
provident
clubs
and
a
treat
was
to
be
held
in
it
the
men
expected
that
ashley
would
look
in
and
henry
ashley
had
sent
round
his
chemical
apparatus
to
give
them
some
experiments
and
had
bought
a
great
the
place
was
now
called
the
ashley
institute
some
thought
ashley
for
one
that
the
halliburton
institute
would
have
been
more
consonant
with
fact
but
william
had
resolutely
withstood
it
the
piece
of
waste
land
behind
it
had
been
converted
into
a
sort
of
playground
and
garden
the
children
were
not
watched
in
it
incessantly
and
screamed
at
you
destroy
those
flowers
you
break
that
window
you
are
tearing
up
the
shrubs
no
they
were
made
to
understand
that
they
were
not
to
do
these
things
and
they
took
the
trust
to
themselves
and
were
proud
of
it
you
may
train
a
child
to
this
if
you
will
as
they
passed
the
house
of
charlotte
east
she
was
turning
in
at
her
garden
gate
and
standing
at
the
window
dandling
a
baby
was
caroline
mason
caroline
was
servant
to
charlotte
now
and
that
was
baby
for
charlotte
was
no
longer
charlotte
east
but
thorneycroft
she
curtsied
as
they
came
up
good
afternoon
gentlemen
i
have
been
round
to
the
rooms
to
show
them
how
to
arrange
the
evergreens
i
hope
they
will
have
a
pleasant
evening
they
echoed
ashley
are
you
not
coming
yourself
i
think
not
sir
adam
and
robert
will
be
there
of
course
but
i
well
leave
baby
nonsense
charlotte
exclaimed
william
what
harm
will
happen
to
the
baby
are
you
afraid
of
its
running
away
ah
sir
you
do
understand
babies
yet
that
has
to
come
laughed
ashley
i
understand
enough
about
babies
to
pronounce
that
one
a
most
exacting
infant
if
you
ca
leave
it
for
an
hour
or
two
persisted
william
you
must
come
charlotte
my
wife
intends
to
be
there
well
sir
i
know
i
should
like
it
perhaps
i
can
manage
to
run
round
for
an
hour
leaving
caroline
to
listen
how
does
caroline
go
on
inquired
ashley
sir
never
a
better
young
woman
went
into
a
house
that
was
a
dreadful
lesson
to
her
and
it
has
taught
her
what
nothing
else
could
i
believe
that
honey
fair
will
respect
her
in
time
my
opinion
is
that
honey
fair
would
not
be
going
far
out
of
its
way
to
respect
her
now
remarked
william
once
a
false
step
is
taken
it
is
very
much
the
fashion
to
go
tripping
over
others
caroline
on
the
contrary
has
been
using
all
her
poor
endeavours
ever
since
to
retrieve
that
first
mistake
i
could
not
wish

chapter
xxv
assize
time
once
more
in
this
the
almost
concluding
chapter
of
the
history
are
we
obliged
to
take
notice
of
assize
saturday
once
more
had
the
high
sheriff
procession
gone
out
to
receive
the
judges
and
never
had
the
cathedral
bells
rung
out
more
clearly
or
the
streets
and
windows
been
so
thronged
a
blast
shrill
and
loud
from
the
advancing
heralds
was
borne
on
the
air
of
the
bright
march
afternoon
as
the
cavalcade
advanced
up
east
street
the
rode
next
two
abreast
in
the
plain
dark
ashley
livery
the
points
of
their
javelins
glittering
in
the
sunshine
scarcely
able
to
advance
for
the
crowd
a
feverish
crowd
little
cared
they
for
the
proud
trumpets
the
the
various
attractions
that
made
their
delight
on
other
of
those
days
they
cared
only
for
that
stately
equipage
in
the
rear
not
for
its
four
prancing
horses
its
silver
ornaments
its
portly
coachman
on
the
not
even
for
the
very
judges
themselves
but
for
the
master
of
that
carriage
the
high
sheriff
thomas
ashley
he
sat
in
it
its
only
plainly
attired
inmate
the
scarlet
robes
the
flowing
wigs
of
the
judges
were
opposite
to
him
beside
him
were
the
rich
black
silk
robes
of
his
chaplain
the
vicar
of
deoffam
a
crowd
of
gentlemen
on
horseback
followed
a
crowd
helstonleigh
had
rarely
seen
william
was
one
of
them
the
popularity
of
a
high
sheriff
may
be
judged
by
the
number
of
his
attendants
when
he
goes
out
to
meet
the
judges
half
helstonleigh
had
placed
itself
on
horseback
that
day
to
do
honour
to
thomas
ashley
occupying
a
conspicuous
position
in
the
street
were
the
ashley
workmen
clean
and
shaved
they
had
surreptitiously
conveyed
their
best
coats
to
the
manufactory
and
with
the
first
peal
of
the
college
bells
had
rushed
out
dressed
every
soul
leaving
the
manufactory
alone
in
its
glory
and
samuel
lynn
to
take
care
of
it
the
shout
they
raised
as
the
sheriff
carriage
drew
near
deafened
the
street
it
was
out
of
all
manner
of
etiquette
or
precedence
to
cheer
the
sheriff
when
in
attendance
on
the
judges
but
who
could
be
angry
with
them
not
ashley
their
lordships
looked
out
astonished
one
of
the
judges
you
have
met
before
sir
william
leader
the
other
was
justice
keene
the
judges
gazed
from
the
carriage
wondering
what
the
shouts
could
mean
they
saw
a
body
of
men
not
respectable
in
dress
only
but
in
face
gathered
there
bareheaded
and
cheering
the
carriage
with
all
their
might
and
main
what
can
that
be
for
cried
justice
keene
i
believe
it
must
be
meant
for
me
observed
ashley
taken
by
surprise
as
much
as
the
judges
were
foolish
fellows
your
lordships
must
understand
that
they
are
the
workmen
belonging
to
my
manufactory
but
his
eyes
were
dim
as
he
leaned
forward
and
acknowledged
the
greeting
such
a
shout
followed
upon
it
the
judges
used
to
shouting
as
they
were
had
rarely
heard
the
like
so
deep
and
heartfelt
was
it
there
genuine
in
that
cheer
said
sir
william
leader
i
like
to
hear
it
it
is
more
than
lip
deep
the
dinner
party
for
the
judges
that
night
was
given
at
the
deanery
not
a
more
honoured
guest
had
it
than
the
high
sheriff
his
chaplain
was
with
him
and
william
and
frank
were
also
guests
what
did
the
dares
think
of
the
halliburtons
now
the
dares
just
then
were
too
much
occupied
with
their
own
concerns
to
think
of
them
at
all
they
were
planning
how
to
get
out
to
australia
their
daughter
julia
more
dutiful
than
some
daughters
might
prove
themselves
had
offered
an
asylum
to
her
father
and
mother
if
they
would
go
out
to
sydney
her
sisters
she
wrote
word
would
find
good
situations
there
as
governesses
probably
in
time
find
husbands
they
were
wild
to
go
they
wanted
to
get
away
from
mortifying
helstonleigh
and
to
try
their
fortunes
in
a
new
world
the
passage
money
was
the
difficulty
julia
had
not
sent
it
possibly
not
supposing
they
were
so
very
badly
off
she
did
not
know
yet
of
the
last
touch
to
their
misfortunes
how
could
they
scrape
together
even
enough
for
a
steerage
passage
ashley
private
opinion
was
that
he
should
have
to
furnish
it
ah
he
was
a
good
man
never
a
better
never
a
more
considerate
to
others
than
thomas
ashley
sunday
morning
rose
to
the
ringing
again
of
the
cathedral
bells
bells
that
do
not
condescend
to
ring
except
on
rare
occasions
telling
that
it
was
some
day
of
note
in
helstonleigh
it
was
a
fine
day
sunny
and
very
warm
for
march
and
the
glittering
east
window
reflected
its
colours
upon
a
crowd
such
as
the
cathedral
had
rarely
seen
assembled
within
its
walls
for
divine
service
even
on
those
thronging
days
assize
sundays
the
procession
extended
nearly
the
whole
way
from
the
grand
entrance
gates
to
the
choir
passing
through
the
body
and
the
nave
the
high
sheriff
men
standing
so
still
their
formidable
javelins
in
rest
had
enough
to
do
to
retain
their
places
from
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
as
they
kept
the
line
of
way
the
bishop
in
his
robes
the
clergy
in
their
white
garments
and
scarlet
or
black
hoods
the
long
line
of
college
boys
in
their
surplices
the
yet
in
white
not
as
you
were
told
of
yesterday
on
them
not
on
the
mayor
and
corporation
with
their
chains
and
gowns
not
on
the
judges
their
fiery
trains
held
up
behind
glaring
cynosure
of
eyes
on
other
days
was
the
attention
of
that
crowd
fixed
but
on
him
who
walked
calm
dignified
quiet
in
immediate
attendance
on
the
judges
their
revered
thomas
ashley
in
attendance
on
was
his
chaplain
his
black
gown
so
contrasting
with
the
glare
and
glitter
marking
him
out
conspicuously
the
organ
had
burst
forth
as
they
entered
the
great
gates
simultaneously
with
the
ceasing
of
the
bells
which
had
been
sending
their
melody
over
the
city
with
some
difficulty
places
were
found
for
those
of
note
but
many
a
score
stood
that
day
the
bishop
had
gone
on
to
his
throne
and
opposite
to
him
in
the
archdeacon
stall
the
appointed
place
for
the
preacher
on
assize
sundays
sat
the
chaplain
sir
william
leader
was
shown
to
the
dean
stall
justice
keene
to
the
the
dean
sitting
next
the
one
the
high
sheriff
next
the
other
william
halliburton
was
in
a
canon
stall
frank
handsome
frank
found
a
place
amidst
many
other
barristers
and
in
the
ladies
pew
underneath
the
dean
seated
with
the
dean
wife
were
ashley
her
daughter
and
halliburton
the
reverend
keating
chanted
the
service
putting
his
best
voice
into
it
they
gave
that
fine
anthem
behold
god
is
my
salvation
very
good
were
the
services
and
the
singing
that
day
the
dean
the
prebendary
in
residence
and
keating
went
to
the
for
the
commandments
and
thus
the
service
drew
to
an
end
as
they
were
conducted
back
to
their
stall
a
verger
with
his
silver
mace
cleared
a
space
for
the
sheriff
chaplain
to
ascend
the
pulpit
stairs
the
preacher
of
the
day
how
the
college
boys
gazed
at
him
only
a
short
time
before
comparatively
speaking
he
had
been
one
of
them
a
college
boy
himself
some
of
the
seniors
juniors
then
had
been
with
him
now
he
was
the
reverend
edgar
halliburton
chief
personage
for
the
moment
in
that
cathedral
to
the
boys
eyes
he
seemed
to
look
dark
except
on
assize
sundays
they
were
accustomed
to
see
only
white
robes
in
that
pulpit
too
young
to
give
us
a
good
sermon
thought
half
the
congregation
as
they
scanned
him
nevertheless
they
liked
his
countenance
its
grave
earnest
look
he
gave
out
his
text
a
verse
from
ecclesiastes
whatsoever
thy
hand
findeth
to
do
do
it
with
thy
might
for
there
is
no
work
nor
device
nor
knowledge
nor
wisdom
in
the
grave
whither
thou
goest
then
he
leaned
a
little
forward
on
the
cushion
and
after
a
pause
began
his
sermon
which
lay
before
him
and
worked
out
the
text
it
was
an
admirable
discourse
clear
and
practical
but
you
will
not
care
to
have
it
recapitulated
for
you
as
it
was
recapitulated
in
the
local
newspapers
remembering
what
the
bringing
up
of
the
halliburtons
had
been
it
was
impossible
that
gar
sermons
should
not
be
practical
and
the
congregation
began
to
think
they
had
been
mistaken
in
their
estimate
of
what
a
young
man
could
do
he
told
the
judges
where
their
duty
lay
as
fearlessly
as
he
told
it
to
the
college
boys
as
he
told
it
to
all
he
told
them
that
the
golden
secret
of
success
and
happiness
in
this
life
lay
in
the
faithful
and
earnest
performance
of
the
duties
that
crowded
on
their
path
striving
on
unweariedly
whatsoever
those
duties
might
be
whether
pleasant
or
painful
to
implicit
reliance
on
and
trust
in
a
plainer
sermon
was
never
preached
in
manner
he
was
remarkably
calm
and
impressive
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
was
quiet
and
persuasive
just
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
them
he
was
listened
to
with
breathless
interest
throughout
even
those
gentry
the
college
boys
were
for
once
beguiled
into
attending
to
a
sermon
tears
fell
incessantly
and
she
had
to
let
down
her
white
veil
to
hide
them
as
on
that
day
years
ago
when
she
had
let
down
her
black
crape
veil
to
conceal
them
in
the
office
of
anthony
dare
different
tears
this
time
the
sermon
lasted
just
half
an
hour
and
it
had
seemed
only
a
quarter
of
one
the
bishop
then
rose
and
gave
the
blessing
and
the
crowds
began
to
file
out
as
the
preacher
was
being
marshalled
by
a
verger
through
the
choir
to
take
his
place
in
the
procession
next
the
high
sheriff
keating
met
him
and
grasped
his
hand
you
are
all
right
gar
he
whispered
and
i
am
proud
of
having
educated
you
that
sermon
will
tell
home
to
some
of
the
drones
i
knew
he
astonish
ejaculated
dobbs
who
had
walked
all
the
way
from
deoffam
to
see
the
sight
to
hear
her
master
preach
to
the
cathedral
and
had
fought
out
a
for
herself
right
in
front
of
the
pulpit
sermons
are
filled
up
with
bottomless
pits
as
are
never
full
enough
like
those
of
some
preachers
be
that
sermon
and
the
rev
edgar
halliburton
were
talked
of
much
in
helstonleigh
that
day
but
ere
the
close
of
another
day
the
town
was
ringing
with
the
name
of
frank
he
had
led
he
frank
halliburton
a
cause
of
some
importance
was
tried
in
the
court
in
which
the
defendant
was
glenn
the
surgeon
glenn
who
had
liked
frank
from
the
hour
he
first
conversed
with
him
that
evening
at
his
house
now
so
long
ago
a
conversation
at
which
you
had
the
pleasure
of
assisting
who
had
also
the
highest
opinion
of
frank
abilities
in
his
profession
had
made
it
a
point
that
his
case
should
be
intrusted
to
frank
glenn
was
not
deceived
frank
led
admirably
and
his
eloquence
quite
took
the
spectators
by
storm
what
was
of
more
importance
it
told
upon
justice
keene
and
the
jury
and
frank
sat
down
in
triumph
and
won
his
verdict
i
told
you
i
should
do
it
mother
said
he
quietly
when
he
reached
deoffam
that
night
after
being
nearly
smothered
with
congratulations
you
will
live
to
see
me
on
the
woolsack
yet
jane
laughed
she
often
had
laughed
at
the
same
boast
she
was
alone
that
evening
gar
was
attending
the
high
sheriff
at
an
official
dinner
at
helstonleigh
will
no
lesser
prize
content
you
frank
asked
she
jestingly
say
for
example
the
only
as
a
and
you
still
get
on
well
seriously
speaking
now
frank
answered
frank
this
day
work
will
be
the
best
lift
for
me
though
unless
i
am
mistaken
i
had
two
fresh
briefs
put
into
my
hands
as
i
sat
down
he
added
going
off
in
a
laugh
see
if
i
make
this
year
less
than
a
thousand
and
the
next
thing
i
suppose
you
will
be
thinking
of
getting
married
the
bold
barrister
actually
blushed
what
nonsense
mother
marry
and
lose
my
fellowship
frank
it
is
so
i
see
it
in
your
face
you
must
tell
me
who
it
is
well
as
yet
it
is
no
one
i
must
wait
until
my
eloquence
as
they
called
it
in
court
is
a
more
assured
fact
with
the
public
and
then
i
may
speak
out
to
the
judge
she
means
waiting
for
me
though
so
it
is
all
right
tell
me
frank
repeated
jane
who
is
maria
leader
jane
looked
at
him
doubtingly
not
sir
william
daughter
his
second
daughter
is
not
that
rather
too
aspiring
for
frank
halliburton
maria
does
not
think
so
i
have
been
aspiring
all
my
life
mother
and
so
long
as
i
work
on
for
it
honourably
and
uprightly
i
see
no
harm
in
being
so
no
frank
good
instead
of
harm
how
did
you
become
acquainted
with
her
her
brother
and
i
are
chums
have
been
ever
since
we
were
at
oxford
bob
is
at
the
chancery
bar
but
he
has
not
much
nous
for
it
not
half
the
clever
man
that
his
father
was
his
chambers
are
next
to
mine
and
i
often
go
home
with
him
the
girls
make
a
great
deal
of
us
too
that
is
how
i
first
knew
maria
then
i
suppose
you
see
something
of
the
judge
oh
dear
laughed
frank
the
judge
and
i
are
upon
intimate
terms
in
private
life
quite
cronies
you
would
not
think
it
though
if
you
saw
me
bowing
before
my
lord
when
he
sits
in
his
big
wig
sometimes
i
fancy
he
suspects
suspects
what
that
i
and
maria
would
like
to
join
cause
together
but
i
do
mind
if
he
does
i
am
a
favourite
of
his
the
very
sunday
before
we
came
on
circuit
he
asked
me
to
dine
there
we
went
to
church
in
the
evening
and
i
had
maria
under
my
wing
sir
william
and
lady
leader
trudging
on
before
us
well
frank
i
wish
you
success
i
do
think
you
would
choose
any
but
a
nice
girl
a
good
girl
stop
a
moment
mother
you
will
meet
the
judge
night
and
you
may
then
draw
a
picture
of
maria
she
is
as
like
him
as
two
peas
how
old
is
she
frank
shall
have
her
he
was
not
always
the
great
judge
leader
you
know
mother
and
he
knows
it
and
he
knows
that
every
one
must
have
a
beginning
as
he
and
my
lady
had
it
for
years
after
they
were
married
he
did
not
make
five
hundred
a
year
and
they
had
to
live
upon
it
he
does
not
fear
to
revert
to
it
either
often
talks
of
it
to
me
and
bob
a
sort
of
hint
i
suppose
that
folk
do
get
on
in
time
by
dint
of
patience
you
will
like
sir
william
leader
yes
jane
would
meet
sir
william
on
the
following
night
for
that
would
be
the
evening
of
the
entertainment
given
by
the
high
sheriff
to
the
judges
at
deoffam
hall
chapter
xxvi
the
high

william
halliburton
drove
his
wife
over
in
the
pony
carriage
in
the
afternoon
they
would
dress
and
sleep
at
deoffam
they
went
early

william
william

talking
with
anna
then
william
asked
what
he
was
to
do
wait
with
the
carriage
for
mary
or
drive
on
to
the
hall
and
walk
back
for
her
drive
to
the
hall
said
mary
who
wished
to
stay
a
little
while
with
anna
but
william
she
added
as
he
got
in
do
let
my
box
go
round
to
the
stables
with
all
its
finery
laughed
william
it
contains
my
dinner
dress
mary
explained
to
anna
have
you
been
here
long
this
hour
i
think
replied
anna
my
husband
had
business
a
mile
or
two
further
on
and
drove
me
here
what
a
nice
garden
this
is
see
i
have
been
picking
gar
flowers
where
is
mrs
halliburton
asked
mary
dobbs
called
her
in
to
settle
some
dispute
in
the
kitchen
i
know
dobbs
is
a
great
tyrant
over
that
new
housemaid
but
now
tell
me
about
yourself
anna
said
mary
leading
her
to
a
bench
i
have
scarcely
seen
you
since
you
were
married
how
do
you
like
being
your
own
mistress
oh
it
charming
replied
anna
with
all
her
old
childish
natural
manner
mary
what
dost
thee
think
charles
lets
me
sit
without
my
caps
mary
laughed
to
the
great
scandal
of
patience
indeed
yes
one
day
patience
called
when
we
were
at
dinner
i
had
not
so
much
as
a
bit
of
net
on
and
patience
looked
so
cross
but
she
said
nothing
for
the
servants
were
in
waiting
when
they
had
left
the
room
she
told
charles
that
she
was
surprised
at
his
allowing
it
that
i
was
giddy
enough
and
vain
enough
and
it
would
only
make
me
worse
charles
smiled
he
was
eating
walnuts
and
what
dost
thee
think
he
answered
he
but
i
do
like
to
tell
thee
broke
off
anna
covering
her
face
with
her
pretty
hands
yes
yes
anna
you
must
tell
me
he
told
patience
that
he
liked
to
see
me
without
the
caps
and
there
was
no
need
for
my
wearing
them
until
i
should
have
children
old
enough
to
set
an
example
to
anna
took
off
her
straw
bonnet
as
she
spoke
and
her
curls
fell
to
shade
her
blushing
cheeks
mary
wondered
whether
the
children
would
have
faces
as
lovely
as
their
mother
she
had
never
seen
anna
look
so
well
for
one
thing
she
had
rarely
seen
her
so
well
dressed
she
wore
a
corded
silk
glistening
with
richness
and
an
exquisite
white
shawl
that
must
have
cost
no
end
of
money
i
should
always
let
my
curls
be
seen
anna
said
mary
there
be
no
harm
in
it
no
that
there
ca
as
charles
does
not
think
so
emphatically
answered
anna
mary
dropping
her
voice
to
a
whisper
i
want
charles
not
to
wear
those
straight
coats
any
more
he
shakes
his
head
at
me
and
laughs
but
i
think
he
will
listen
to
me
seeing
what
she
did
of
the
change
in
anna
dress
mary
thought
so
too
not
but
that
anna
things
were
still
cut
sufficiently
in
the
old
form
to
bespeak
her
sect
as
they
no
doubt
always
would
be
when
art
thee
coming
to
spend
the
day
with
me
as
thee
promised
asked
anna
very
soon
when
this
assize
bustle
shall
be
over
how
gay
you
will
be
how
formal
you
mean
said
mary
to
entertain
judges
when
on
circuit
and
bishops
and
deans
is
more
formidable
than
pleasant
it
is
a
state
dinner
when
i
saw
papa
this
morning
i
inquired
if
we
were
to
have
the
on
guard
in
the
anna
laughed
do
frank
and
gar
dine
there
of
course
the
high
sheriff
could
not
give
a
dinner
party
without
his
chaplain
at
hand
to
say
grace
returned
mary
laughing
william
came
back
and
they
all
remained
for
almost
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
jane
regaling
them
with
tea
it
was
scarcely
over
when
gurney
drove
up
in
his
carriage
a
large
open
carriage
the
seat
behind
the
horses
very
fine
ones
he
came
in
for
a
few
minutes
a
very
pleasant
man
of
nearly
forty
years
a
handsome
man
also
then
he
took
possession
of
anna
carefully
assisted
her
up
took
the
seat
beside
her
and
the
reins
and
drove
off
william
started
for
the
hall
with
mary
walking
at
a
brisk
pace
it
was
not
ten
minutes
distance
but
the
evening
was
getting
on
henry
ashley
met
them
as
they
entered
and
began
upon
them
in
his
crossest
tones
now
what
have
you
two
got
to
say
for
yourselves
here
i
expect
you
william
to
pass
the
afternoon
with
me
the
mother
expects
mary
and
nothing
arrives
but
a
milliner
box
and
you
make
your
appearance
when
it
pretty
nearly
time
to
go
up
to
embellish
we
stayed
at
the
vicarage
henry
and
i
do
think
mamma
could
want
me
anna
gurney
was
there
rubbish
who
anna
gurney
that
she
should
upset
things
i
wanted
william
and
that
enough
do
you
think
you
are
to
monopolize
him
mary
just
because
you
happen
to
have
married
him
mary
went
behind
her
brother
and
playfully
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
i
will
lend
him
to
you
now
and
then
if
you
are
good
she
whispered
you
idle
inattentive
girl
the
mother
wanted
you
to
cut
some
flowers
for
the
did
she
i
will
do
it
now
listen
to
her
do
it
now
when
it
has
been
done
this
hour
past
william
i
do
intend
to
show
up
why
not
asked
william
it
is
a
nuisance
to
change
one
things
and
my
side
not
over
clever
and
the
ungrateful
delinquency
of
you
two
has
put
me
altogether
answered
henry
making
up
his
catalogue
condemning
one
to
vain
expectation
and
to
fretting
and
fuming
over
it
i
sha
show
up
william
must
represent
me
yes
you
will
show
up
replied
william
for
you
know
that
your
not
doing
so
would
vex
mr
ashley
a
nice
lot
are
to
talk
about
vexing
you
do
care
how
you
vex
me
william
gently
took
him
by
the
arm
come
along
to
your
room
now
and
i
will
help
you
with
your
things
once
ready
you
can
do
as
you
like
about
appearing
you
treat
me
just
as
a
child
grumbled
henry
i
say
do
the
judges
come
in
their
wigs
mary
broke
into
a
laugh
because
that
case
of
stuffed
owls
had
better
be
ordered
out
of
the
hall
the
animals
may
be
looked
upon
as
personal
i
hope
there
a
good
fire
in
your
room
henry
there
had
better
be
unless
the
genius
that
presides
over
the
fires
in
this
household
would
like
to
feel
the
weight
of
my
displeasure
mary
went
to
find
her
mother
she
was
in
her
chamber
dressing
my
dear
child
how
late
you
are
there
plenty
of
time
mamma
we
stayed
at
the
parsonage
anna
gurney
was
there
henry
says
he
is
not
very
well
he
says
that
always
when
william
disappoints
him
he
will
be
all
right
now
you
have
come
go
to
your
room
my
dear
and
i
will
send
sarah
to
you
mary
was
ready
and
the
maid
gone
before
william
left
henry
to
come
and
dress
on
his
own
account
mary
wore
white
silk
with
emerald
ornaments
shall
i
do
william
asked
she
when
william
came
in
do
he
answered
running
his
eyes
over
her
no
why
what
the
matter
with
me
she
cried
turning
hurriedly
to
the
great
glass
this
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
passionately
my
darling
wife
you
will
never
without
that
it
was
not
a
formidable
party
at
all
in
defiance
of
anticipations
the
judges
divested
of
their
flowing
wigs
and
flaming
robes
looked
just
like
other
men
jane
liked
sir
william
leader
as
frank
had
told
her
she
would
and
justice
keene
was
an
easy
talkative
man
fond
of
a
good
joke
and
a
good
dinner
justice
keene
seemed
excessively
to
admire
mary
halliburton
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
and
i
hope
the
legal
bench
wo
look
grave
at
the
reflection
seemed
very
much
inclined
to
get
up
a
flirtation
with
her
over
the
coffee
being
a
judge
i
think
the
bishop
ought
to
have
read
him
a
reprimand
standing
at
one
end
of
the
room
in
hand
were
sir
william
leader
the
dean
of
helstonleigh
ashley
and
his
son
they
were
talking
of
the
halliburtons
sir
william
knew
a
good
deal
of
their
history
from
frank
it
is
most
wonderful
sir
william
was
remarking
and
to
be
what
they
are
not
altogether
dissented
the
dean
for
the
two
younger
the
barrister
and
clergyman
were
in
the
school
attached
to
my
cathedral
but
in
a
great
degree
the
eldest
my
never
had
a
lesson
in
the
classics
after
his
father
death
and
there
not
a
more
finished
scholar
in
the
county
the
father
died
and
left
them
badly
provided
for
remarked
sir
william
he
did
not
leave
them
provided
for
at
all
sir
william
corrected
ashley
he
left
nothing
literally
nothing
but
the
furniture
of
the
small
house
they
rented
and
he
left
some
trifling
debts
poor
halliburton
turned
to
work
with
a
will
and
not
only
contrived
to
support
them
but
brought
them
up
to
be
what
you
see
them
honourable
educated
men
the
judge
turned
his
eyes
on
jane
she
was
sitting
on
a
distant
sofa
talking
with
the
bishop
so
quiet
so
nay
so
attractive
she
looked
still
in
the
rich
dress
warn
at
william
wedding
not
in
the
least
like
one
who
had
had
to
toil
hard
for
bread
i
have
heard
of
her
heard
of
her
worth
from
frank
he
said
with
emphasis
she
must
be
one
in
a
thousand
one
in
a
million
sir
william
burst
forth
henry
ashley
when
they
were
boys
you
could
not
have
bribed
them
to
do
a
wrong
thing
neither
temptation
nor
anything
else
turned
them
from
the
right
and
they
would
not
be
turned
from
the
right
now
if
i
know
anything
of
them
the
judge
walked
up
to
jane
and
took
the
seat
beside
her
just
vacated
by
the
bishop
halliburton
said
he
you
must
be
proud
of
your
sons
jane
smiled
i
have
latterly
been
obliged
to
take
myself
to
task
for
being
so
sir
william
she
answered
to
task
i
wish
i
had
three
such
sons
to
take
myself
to
task
for
being
proud
of
was
his
answer
not
that
mine
are
to
be
found
fault
with
but
they
are
not
like
these
do
you
think
frank
will
get
on
she
asked
him
it
is
no
longer
a
question
of
getting
on
he
has
begun
to
rise
in
an
unusually
rapid
manner
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
in
he
may
find
the
very
highest
honours
opening
to
him
again
jane
smiled
he
has
been
in
the
habit
of
telling
us
that
he
looks
forward
to
ruling
england
as
lord
chancellor
the
judge
laughed
i
never
knew
a
barrister
who
did
not
indulge
that
vision
said
he
i
know
i
did
but
there
are
really
not
many
frank
halliburtons
so
sir
he
continued
for
frank
at
that
moment
passed
and
the
judge
pinned
him
i
hear
you
cherish
dreams
of
the
woolsack
to
look
at
it
from
a
distance
is
not
high
treason
sir
william
was
frank
ready
answer
why
what
do
you
suppose
would
do
on
the
woolsack
if
you
got
there
cried
sir
william
my
duty
i
hope
sir
william
i
would
try
hard
for
it
sir
william
loosed
him
with
an
amused
expression
and
frank
passed
on
jane
began
to
think
frank
dream
not
of
the
woolsack
but
of
maria
leader
not
so
very
improbable
a
one
i
have
heard
of
your
early
struggles
said
the
judge
to
her
in
low
tones
frank
has
talked
to
me
how
you
could
have
borne
up
and
done
battle
with
them
i
can
not
imagine
i
never
could
have
done
it
but
for
one
thing
she
answered
my
trust
in
god
times
upon
times
sir
william
when
the
storm
was
beating
about
my
head
i
had
no
help
or
comfort
in
the
wide
world
i
had
nothing
to
turn
to
but
that
i
never
lost
my
trust
in
god
and
therefore
god
stood
by
you
remarked
the
judge
and
god
stood
by
me
and
helped
me
on
i
wish
she
added
earnestly
the
whole
world
could
learn
the
same
great
lesson
that
i
have
learnt
i
have
i
humbly
hope
i
have
been
enabled
to
teach
it
to
my
boys
i
have
tried
to
do
it
from
their
very
earliest
years
frank
shall
have
maria
thought
the
judge
to
himself
they
are
an
admirable
family
the
young
chaplain
should
have
another
of
the
girls
if
he
liked
her
what
was
william
thinking
of
as
he
stood
a
little
apart
with
his
serene
brow
and
his
thoughtful
smile
his
mind
was
in
the
past
that
long
past
night
following
the
day
of
his
entrance
to
manufactory
was
present
to
him
when
he
had
lain
down
in
despair
and
sobbed
out
his
bitter
grief
bear
up
my
child
were
the
words
his
mother
had
comforted
him
with
only
do
your
duty
and
trust
implicitly
in
god
and
when
she
had
gone
down
and
he
could
get
the
sobs
away
from
his
heart
and
throat
he
made
the
resolve
to
do
as
she
had
told
him
at
any
rate
to
try
and
do
it
and
he
kneeled
down
there
and
then
and
asked
to
be
helped
to
do
it
and
from
that
hour
to
this
william
had
never
known
the
trust
to
fail
success
yes
they
had
reaped
success
success
in
no
measured
degree
be
very
sure
that
it
was
born
of
that
great
trust
oh
as
jane
had
just
said
to
sir
william
leader
if
the
world
could
only
learn
this
wonderful
truth
because
he
hath
set
his
love
upon
me
therefore
will
i
deliver
him
i
will
set
him
up
because
he
hath
known
my
name
the
end
