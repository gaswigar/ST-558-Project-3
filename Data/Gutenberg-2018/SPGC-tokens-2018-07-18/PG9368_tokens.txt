a
to
my
grandfather
dear
captain
john
griffis
although
i
never
saw
you
since
you
died
in
i
am
glad
you
were
one
of
those
welshmen
who
opposed
the
policy
of
king
george
iii
and
that
you
after
coming
to
america
in
were
among
the
first
sea
captains
to
carry
the
american
flag
around
the
world
that
you
knew
many
of
the
free
quakers
and
other
patriots
of
the
revolution
and
that
they
buried
you
among
them
near
benjamin
franklin
is
a
matter
of
pride
to
your
descendants
that
you
were
born
in
wales
and
spoke
welsh
as
did
also
those
three
great
prophets
of
spiritual
liberty
roger
williams
william
penn
and
thomas
jefferson
is
still
further
ground
for
pride
in
one
ancestry
now
in
the
perspective
of
history
we
see
that
our
washington
and
his
compeers
and
wilkes
barre
burke
and
the
friends
of
america
in
parliament
were
fighting
the
same
battle
of
freedom
though
our
debt
to
wales
for
many
things
is
great
we
count
not
least
those
inheritances
from
the
world
of
imagination
for
which
the
cymric

was
famous

long
long
ago
there
was
a
good
saint
named
david
who
taught
the
early
cymric
or
welsh
people
better
manners
and
many
good
things
to
eat
and
ways
of
enjoying
themselves
now
the
welsh
folks
in
speaking
of
their
good
teacher
pronounced
his
name
tafid
and
affectionately
taffy
and
this
came
to
be
the
usual
name
for
a
person
born
in
wales
in
our
nurseries
we
all
learned
that
taffy
was
a
welshman
but
it
was
their
enemies
who
made
a
bad
rhyme
about
taffy
wherever
there
were
cows
or
goats
people
could
get
milk
so
they
always
had
what
was
necessary
for
a
good
meal
whether
it
were
breakfast
dinner
or
supper
milk
cream
curds
whey
and
cheese
enriched
the
family
table
were
not
these
enough
but
saint
david
taught
the
people
how
to
make
a
still
more
delicious
food
out
of
cheese
and
that
this
could
be
done
without
taking
the
life
of
any
creature
saint
david
showed
the
girls
how
to
take
cheese
slice
and
toast
it
over
the
coals
or
melt
it
in
a
skillet
and
pour
it
hot
over
toast
or
biscuit
this
gave
the
cheese
a
new
and
sweeter
flavor
when
spread
on
bread
either
plain
or
browned
over
the
fire
the
result
in
combination
was
a
delicacy
fit
for
a
king
and
equal
to
anything
known
the
fame
of
this
new
addition
to
the
british
bill
of
fare
spread
near
and
far
the
english
people
who
had
always
been
fond
of
rabbit
pie
and
still
eat
thousands
of
molly
cotton
tails
every
day
named
it
welsh
rabbit
and
thought
it
one
of
the
best
things
to
eat
in
fact
there
are
many
people
who
do
not
easily
see
a
joke
who
misunderstand
the
fun
or
who
suppose
the
name
to
be
either
slang
or
vulgar
or
a
mistake
and
who
call
it
rarebit
it
is
like
cape
cod
turkey
codfish
or
bombay
ducks
dried
fish
or
irish
plums
potatoes
and
such
funny
cookery
with
fancy
names
now
up
to
this
time
the
rabbits
and
hares
had
been
so
hunted
with
the
aid
of
dogs
that
there
was
hardly
a
chance
of
any
of
them
surviving
the
cruel
slaughter
in
the
year
the
prince
of
powys
was
out
hunting
the
dogs
started
a
hare
and
pursued
it
into
a
dense
thicket
when
the
hunter
with
the
horn
came
up
a
strange
sight
met
his
eyes
there
he
saw
a
lovely
maiden
she
was
kneeling
on
the
ground
and
devoutly
praying
though
surprised
at
this
the
prince
was
anxious
to
secure
his
game
he
hissed
on
the
hounds
and
ordered
the
horn
to
be
blown
for
the
dogs
to
charge
on
their
prey
expecting
them
to
bring
him
the
game
at
once
instead
of
this
though
they
were
trained
dogs
and
would
fight
even
a
wolf
they
slunk
away
howling
and
frightened
as
if
in
pain
while
the
horn
stuck
fast
to
the
lips
of
the
blower
and
he
was
silent
meanwhile
the
hare
nestled
under
the
maiden
dress
and
seemed
not
in
the
least
disturbed
amazed
at
this
the
prince
turned
to
the
fair
lady
and
asked
who
are
you
she
answered
my
mother
named
me
monacella
i
have
fled
from
ireland
where
my
father
wished
to
marry
me
to
one
of
his
chief
men
whom
i
did
not
love
under
god
guidance
i
came
to
this
secret
desert
place
where
i
have
lived
for
fifteen
years
without
seeing
the
face
of
man
to
this
the
prince
in
admiration
replied
o
most
worthy
melangell
which
is
the
way
the
welsh
pronounce
monacella
because
on
account
of
thy
merits
it
has
pleased
god
to
shelter
and
save
this
little
wild
hare
i
on
my
part
herewith
present
thee
with
this
land
to
be
for
the
service
of
god
and
an
asylum
for
all
men
and
women
who
seek
thy
protection
so
long
as
they
do
not
pollute
this
sanctuary
let
none
not
even
prince
or
chieftain
drag
them
forth
the
beautiful
saint
passed
the
rest
of
her
life
in
this
place
at
night
she
slept
on
the
bare
rock
many
were
the
wonders
wrought
for
those
who
with
pure
hearts
sought
her
refuge
the
little
wild
hares
were
under
her
special
protection
and
they
are
still
called
melangell
lambs
ii
the
mighty
monster
afang
after
the
cymric
folk
that
is
the
people
we
call
welsh
had
come
up
from
cornwall
into
their
new
land
they
began
to
cut
down
the
trees
to
build
towns
and
to
have
fields
and
gardens
soon
they
made
the
landscape
smile
with
pleasant
homes
rich
farms
and
playing
children
they
trained
vines
and
made
flowers
grow
the
young
folks
made
pets
of
the
wild
animals
cubs
which
their
fathers
and
big
brothers
brought
home
from
hunting
old
men
took
rushes
and
reeds
and
wove
them
into
cages
for
song
birds
to
live
in
while
they
were
draining
the
swamps
and
bogs
they
drove
out
the
monsters
that
had
made
their
lair
in
these
wet
places
these
terrible
creatures
liked
to
poison
people
with
their
bad
breath
and
even
ate
up
very
little
boys
and
girls
when
they
strayed
away
from
home
so
all
the
face
of
the
open
country
between
the
forests
became
very
pretty
to
look
at
the
whole
of
cymric
land
which
then
extended
from
the
northern
grampian
hills
to
cornwall
and
from
the
irish
sea
past
their
big
fort
afterward
called
london
even
to
the
edge
of
the
german
ocean
became
a
delightful
place
to
live
in
the
lowlands
and
the
rivers
in
which
the
tide
rose
and
fell
daily
were
especially
attractive
this
was
chiefly
because
of
the
many
bright
flowers
growing
there
while
the
yellow
gorse
and
the
pink
heather
made
the
hills
look
as
lovely
as
a
young
girl
face
besides
this
the
cymric
maidens
were
the
prettiest
ever
and
the
lads
were
all
brave
and
healthy
while
both
of
these
knew
how
to
sing
often
and
well
now
there
was
a
great
monster
named
the
afang
that
lived
in
a
big
bog
hidden
among
the
high
hills
and
inside
of
a
dark
rough
forest
this
ugly
creature
had
an
back
and
a
long
tail
that
could
wrap
itself
around
a
mountain
it
had
four
front
legs
with
big
knees
that
were
bent
up
like
a
grasshopper
but
were
covered
with
scales
like
armor
these
were
as
hard
as
steel
and
bulged
out
at
the
thighs
along
its
back
was
a
ridge
of
horns
like
spines
and
higher
than
an
alligator
against
such
a
tough
hide
when
the
hunters
shot
their
darts
and
hurled
their
javelins
these
weapons
fell
down
to
the
ground
like
harmless
pins
on
this
monster
head
were
big
ears
half
way
between
those
of
a
jackass
and
an
elephant
its
eyes
were
as
green
as
leeks
and
were
round
but
scalloped
on
the
edges
like
squashes
while
they
were
as
big
as
pumpkins
the
afang
face
was
much
like
a
monkey
or
a
gorilla
with
long
straggling
gray
hairs
around
its
cheeks
like
those
of
a
walrus
it
always
looked
as
if
a
napkin
as
big
as
a
bath
towel
would
be
necessary
to
keep
its
mouth
clean
yet
even
then
it
slobbered
a
good
deal
so
that
no
nice
fairy
liked
to
be
near
the
monster
when
the
afang
growled
the
bushes
shook
and
the
oak
leaves
trembled
on
the
branches
as
if
a
strong
wind
was
blowing
but
after
its
dinner
when
it
had
swallowed
down
a
man
or
two
calves
or
four
sheep
or
a
fat
heifer
or
three
goats
its
body
swelled
up
like
a
balloon
then
it
usually
rolled
over
lay
along
the
ground
or
in
the
soft
mud
and
felt
very
stupid
and
sleepy
for
a
long
while
all
around
its
lair
lay
wagon
loads
of
bones
of
the
creatures
girls
women
men
boys
cows
and
occasionally
a
donkey
which
it
had
devoured
but
when
the
afang
was
ravenously
hungry
and
could
not
get
these
animals
and
when
fat
girls
and
careless
boys
were
scarce
it
would
live
on
birds
beasts
and
fishes
although
it
was
very
fond
of
cows
and
sheep
yet
the
wool
and
hair
of
these
animals
stuck
in
its
big
teeth
it
often
felt
very
miserable
and
its
usually
bad
temper
grew
worse
then
like
a
beaver
it
would
cut
down
a
tree
sharpen
it
to
a
point
and
pick
its
teeth
until
its
mouth
was
clean
yet
it
seemed
all
the
more
hungry
and
eager
for
fresh
human
victims
to
eat
especially
juicy
maidens
just
as
children
like
cake
more
than
bread
the
cymric
men
were
not
surprised
at
this
for
they
knew
that
girls
were
very
sweet
and
they
almost
worshiped
women
so
they
learned
to
guard
their
daughters
and
wives
they
saw
that
to
do
such
things
as
eating
up
people
was
in
the
nature
of
the
beast
which
could
never
be
taught
good
manners
but
what
made
them
mad
beyond
measure
was
the
trick
which
the
monster
often
played
upon
them
by
breaking
the
river
banks
and
the
dykes
which
with
great
toil
they
had
built
to
protect
their
crops
then
the
waters
overflowed
all
their
farms
ruined
their
gardens
and
spoiled
their
cow
houses
and
stables
this
sort
of
mischief
the
afang
liked
to
play
especially
about
the
time
when
the
oat
and
barley
crops
were
ripe
and
ready
to
be
gathered
to
make
cakes
and
flummery
that
is
sour
or
pap
so
it
often
happened
that
the
children
had
to
do
without
their
cookies
and
porridge
during
the
winter
sometimes
the
floods
rose
so
high
as
to
wash
away
the
houses
and
float
the
cradles
even
those
with
little
babies
in
them
were
often
seen
on
the
raging
waters
and
sent
dancing
on
the
waves
down
the
river
to
the
sea
once
in
a
while
a
mother
cat
and
all
her
kittens
were
seen
mewing
for
help
or
a
lady
dog
howling
piteously
often
it
happened
that
both
puppies
and
kittens
were
drowned
so
whether
for
men
or
mothers
pussies
or
puppies
the
cymric
men
thought
the
time
had
come
to
stop
this
monster
mischief
it
was
bad
enough
that
people
should
be
eaten
up
but
to
have
all
their
crops
ruined
and
animals
drowned
so
that
they
had
to
go
hungry
all
winter
with
only
a
little
fried
fish
and
no
turnips
was
too
much
for
human
patience
there
were
too
many
weeping
mothers
and
sorrowful
fathers
and
squalling
brats
and
animals
whining
for
something
to
eat
besides
if
all
the
oats
were
washed
away
how
could
their
wives
make
flummery
without
which
no
cymric
man
is
ever
happy
and
where
would
they
get
seed
for
another
year
sowing
and
if
there
were
no
cows
how
could
the
babies
or
kitties
live
or
any
persons
get
buttermilk
someone
may
ask
why
did
not
some
brave
man
shoot
the
afang
with
a
poisoned
arrow
or
drive
a
spear
into
him
under
the
arms
where
the
flesh
was
tender
or
cut
off
his
head
with
a
sharp
sword
the
trouble
was
just
here
there
were
plenty
of
brave
fellows
ready
to
fight
the
monster
but
nothing
made
of
iron
could
pierce
that
hide
of
his
this
was
like
armor
or
one
of
the
steel
battleships
of
our
day
and
the
afang
always
spit
out
fire
or
poison
breath
down
the
road
up
which
a
man
was
coming
long
before
the
brave
fellow
could
get
near
him
nothing
would
do
but
to
go
up
into
his
lair
and
drag
him
out
but
what
man
or
company
of
men
was
strong
enough
to
do
this
when
a
dozen
giants
in
a
gang
with
ropes
as
thick
as
a
ship
hawser
could
hardly
tackle
the
job
nevertheless
in
what
neither
man
nor
giant
could
do
a
pretty
maiden
might
succeed
true
she
must
be
brave
also
for
how
could
she
know
but
if
hungry
the
afang
might
eat
her
up
however
one
valiant
damsel
of
great
beauty
who
had
lots
of
perfumery
and
plenty
of
pretty
clothes
volunteered
to
bind
the
monster
in
his
lair
she
said
i
not
afraid
her
sweetheart
was
named
gadern
and
he
was
a
young
and
strong
hunter
he
talked
over
the
matter
with
her
and
they
two
resolved
to
act
together
gadern
went
all
over
the
country
summoning
the
farmers
to
bring
their
ox
teams
and
log
chains
then
he
set
the
blacksmiths
to
work
forging
new
and
especially
heavy
ones
made
of
the
best
native
iron
from
the
mines
for
which
wales
is
still
famous
meanwhile
the
lovely
maiden
arrayed
herself
in
her
prettiest
clothes
dressed
her
hair
in
the
most
enticing
way
hanging
a
white
blossom
on
each
side
over
her
ears
with
one
flower
also
at
her
neck
when
she
had
perfumed
her
garments
she
sallied
forth
and
up
the
lake
where
the
big
bog
and
the
waters
were
and
where
the
monster
hid
himself
while
the
maiden
was
still
quite
a
distance
away
the
terrible
afang
scenting
his
visitor
from
afar
came
rushing
out
of
his
lair
when
very
near
he
reared
his
head
high
in
the
air
expecting
to
pounce
on
her
with
his
iron
clad
claws
and
at
one
swallow
make
a
breakfast
of
the
girl
but
the
odors
of
her
perfumes
were
so
sweet
that
he
forgot
what
he
had
thought
to
do
moreover
when
he
looked
at
her
he
was
so
taken
with
unusual
beauty
that
he
flopped
at
once
on
his
forefeet
then
he
behaved
just
like
a
lovelorn
beau
when
his
best
girl
comes
near
he
ties
his
necktie
and
pulls
down
his
coat
and
brushes
off
the
collar
so
the
afang
began
to
spruce
up
it
was
real
fun
to
see
how
a
monster
behaves
when
smitten
with
love
for
a
pretty
girl
he
had
no
idea
how
funny
he
was
the
girl
was
not
at
all
afraid
but
smoothed
the
monster
back
stroked
and
played
with
its
big
moustaches
and
tickled
its
neck
until
the
afang
throat
actually
gurgled
with
a
laugh
pretty
soon
he
guffawed
for
he
was
so
delighted
when
he
did
this
the
people
down
in
the
valley
thought
it
was
thunder
though
the
sky
was
clear
and
blue
the
maiden
tickled
his
chin
and
even
put
up
his
whiskers
in
curl
papers
then
she
stroked
his
neck
so
that
his
eyes
closed
soon
she
had
gently
lulled
him
to
slumber
by
singing
a
cradle
song
which
her
mother
had
taught
her
this
she
did
so
softly
and
sweetly
that
in
a
few
minutes
with
its
head
in
her
lap
the
monster
was
sound
asleep
and
even
began
to
snore
then
quietly
from
their
hiding
places
in
the
bushes
gadern
and
his
men
crawled
out
when
near
the
dreaded
afang
they
stood
up
and
sneaked
forward
very
softly
on
tip
toe
they
had
wrapped
the
links
of
the
chain
in
grass
and
leaves
so
that
no
clanking
was
heard
they
also
held
the
oxen
yokes
so
that
nobody
or
anything
could
rattle
or
make
any
noise
slowly
but
surely
they
passed
the
chain
over
its
body
in
the
middle
besides
binding
the
brute
securely
between
its
fore
and
hind
legs
all
this
time
the
monster
slept
on
for
the
girl
kept
on
crooning
her
melody
when
the
forty
yoke
of
oxen
were
all
harnessed
together
the
drovers
cracked
all
their
whips
at
once
so
that
it
sounded
like
a
clap
of
thunder
and
the
whole
team
began
to
pull
together
then
the
afang
woke
up
with
a
start
the
sudden
jerk
roused
the
monster
to
wrath
and
its
bellowing
was
terrible
it
rolled
round
and
round
and
dug
its
four
sets
of
toes
each
with
three
claws
every
one
as
big
as
a
plowshare
into
the
ground
it
tried
hard
to
crawl
into
its
lair
or
slip
into
the
lake
finding
that
neither
was
possible
the
afang
looked
about
for
some
big
tree
to
wrap
its
tail
around
but
all
his
writhings
or
plungings
were
of
no
use
the
drovers
plied
their
whips
and
the
oxen
kept
on
with
one
long
pull
together
and
forward
they
strained
so
hard
that
one
of
them
dropped
its
eye
out
this
formed
a
pool
and
to
this
day
they
call
it
the
pool
of
the
ox
eye
it
never
dries
up
or
overflows
though
the
water
in
it
rises
and
falls
as
regularly
as
the
tides
for
miles
over
the
mountains
the
sturdy
oxen
hauled
the
monster
the
pass
over
which
they
toiled
and
strained
so
hard
is
still
named
the
pass
of
the
oxen
slope
when
going
down
hill
the
work
of
dragging
the
afang
was
easier
in
a
great
hole
in
the
ground
big
enough
to
be
a
pond
they
dumped
the
carcass
of
the
afang
and
soon
a
little
lake
was
formed
this
uncanny
bit
of
water
is
called
the
lake
of
the
green
well
it
is
considered
dangerous
for
man
or
beast
to
go
too
near
it
birds
do
not
like
to
fly
over
the
surface
and
when
sheep
tumble
in
they
sink
to
the
bottom
at
once
if
the
bones
of
the
afang
still
lie
at
the
bottom
they
must
have
sunk
down
very
deep
for
the
monster
had
no
more
power
to
get
out
or
to
break
the
river
banks
the
farmers
no
longer
cared
anything
about
the
creature
and
they
hardly
every
think
of
the
old
story
except
when
a
sheep
is
lost
as
for
gadern
and
his
brave
and
lovely
sweetheart
they
were
married
and
lived
long
and
happily
their
descendants
in
the
generation
are
proud
of
the
grand
exploit
of
their
ancestors
while
all
the
farmers
honor
his
memory
and
bless
the
name
of
the
lovely
girl
that
put
the
monster
asleep
iii
the
two
cat
witches
in
old
days
it
was
believed
that
the
seventh
son
in
a
family
of
sons
was
a
conjurer
by
nature
that
is
he
could
work
wonders
like
the
fairies
and
excel
the
doctors
in
curing
diseases
if
he
were
the
seventh
son
of
a
seventh
son
he
was
himself
a
wonder
of
wonders
the
story
ran
that
he
could
even
cure
the
shingles
which
is
a
very
troublesome
disease
it
is
called
also
by
a
latin
name
which
means
a
snake
because
as
it
gets
worse
it
coils
itself
around
the
body
now
the
eagle
can
attack
the
serpent
and
conquer
and
kill
this
poisonous
creature
to
secure
such
power
hugh
the
conjurer
ate
the
flesh
of
eagles
when
he
wished
to
cure
the
he
uttered
words
in
the
form
of
a
charm
which
acted
as
a
talisman
and
cure
after
wetting
the
red
rash
which
had
broken
out
over
the
sick
person
body
he
muttered
i
send
you
over
nine
seas
and
over
nine
mountains
and
over
nine
acres
of
moor
and
fen
where
no
dog
shall
bark
no
cow
low
and
no
eagle
shall
higher
rise
after
that
the
patient
was
sure
that
he
felt
better
there
was
always
great
rivalry
between
these
conjurers
and
those
who
made
money
from
the
pilgrims
at
holy
wells
and
visitors
to
the
relic
shrines
but
this
fellow
named
hugh
and
the
monks
kept
on
mutually
good
terms
they
often
ate
dinner
together
for
hugh
was
a
great
traveler
over
the
whole
country
and
always
had
news
to
tell
to
the
holy
brothers
who
lived
in
cells
one
night
as
he
was
eating
supper
at
an
inn
four
men
came
in
and
sat
down
at
the
table
with
him
by
his
magical
power
hugh
knew
that
they
were
robbers
and
meant
to
kill
him
that
night
in
order
to
get
his
money
so
to
divert
their
attention
hugh
made
something
like
a
horn
to
grow
up
out
of
the
table
and
then
laid
a
spell
on
the
robbers
so
that
they
were
kept
gazing
at
the
curious
thing
all
night
long
while
he
went
to
bed
and
slept
soundly
when
he
rose
in
the
morning
he
paid
his
bill
and
went
away
while
the
robbers
were
still
gazing
at
the
horn
only
when
the
officers
arrived
to
take
them
to
prison
did
they
come
to
themselves
now
at
pretty
place
which
has
a
name
that
sounds
so
funny
to
us
americans
and
suggests
a
girl
named
betty
the
at
college
there
was
a
hotel
named
the
inn
of
three
kegs
the
shop
sign
hung
out
in
front
it
was
a
bunch
of
grapes
gilded
and
set
below
three
small
barrels
this
inn
was
kept
by
two
respectable
ladies
who
were
sisters
yet
in
that
very
hotel
several
travelers
while
they
were
asleep
had
been
robbed
of
their
money
they
could
not
blame
anyone
nor
tell
how
the
mischief
was
done
with
the
key
in
the
keyhole
they
had
kept
their
doors
locked
during
the
night
they
were
sure
that
no
one
had
entered
the
room
there
were
no
signs
of
men
boots
or
of
footsteps
in
the
garden
while
nothing
was
visible
on
the
lock
or
door
to
show
that
either
had
been
tampered
with
everything
was
in
order
as
when
they
went
to
bed
some
people
doubted
their
stories
but
when
they
applied
to
hugh
the
conjurer
he
believed
them
and
volunteered
to
solve
the
mystery
his
motto
was
go
anywhere
and
everywhere
but
catch
the
thief
when
hugh
applied
one
night
for
lodging
at
the
inn
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
than
the
welcome
and
fine
manners
of
his
two
hostesses
at
supper
time
and
during
the
evening
they
all
chatted
together
merrily
hugh
who
was
never
at
a
loss
for
news
or
stories
told
about
the
various
kinds
of
people
and
the
many
countries
he
had
visited
in
imagination
just
as
if
he
had
seen
them
all
though
he
had
never
set
foot
outside
of
wales
when
he
was
ready
to
go
to
bed
he
said
to
the
ladies
it
is
my
custom
to
keep
a
light
burning
in
my
room
all
night
but
i
will
not
ask
for
candles
for
i
have
enough
to
last
me
until
sunrise
so
saying
he
bade
them
good
night
entering
his
room
and
locking
the
door
he
undressed
but
laid
his
clothes
near
at
hand
he
drew
his
trusty
sword
out
of
its
sheath
and
laid
it
upon
the
bed
beside
him
where
he
could
quickly
grasp
it
then
he
pretended
to
be
asleep
and
even
snored
it
was
not
long
before
peeping
between
his
eyelids
only
half
closed
he
saw
two
cats
come
stealthily
down
the
chimney
when
in
the
room
the
animals
frisked
about
and
then
gamboled
and
romped
in
the
most
lively
way
then
they
chased
each
other
around
the
bed
as
if
they
were
trying
to
find
out
whether
hugh
was
asleep
meanwhile
the
supposed
sleeper
kept
perfectly
motionless
soon
the
two
cats
came
over
to
his
clothes
and
one
of
them
put
her
paw
into
the
pocket
that
contained
his
purse
at
this
with
one
sweep
of
his
sword
hugh
struck
at
the
cat
paw
the
beast
howled
frightfully
and
both
animals
ran
for
the
chimney
and
disappeared
after
that
everything
was
quiet
until
breakfast
time
at
the
table
only
one
of
the
sisters
was
present
hugh
politely
inquired
after
the
other
one
he
was
told
that
she
was
not
well
for
which
hugh
said
he
was
very
sorry
after
the
meal
hugh
declared
he
must
say
to
both
the
sisters
whose
company
he
had
so
enjoyed
the
night
before
in
spite
of
the
other
lady
many
excuses
he
was
admitted
to
the
sick
lady
room
after
polite
greetings
and
mutual
compliments
hugh
offered
his
hand
to
say
the
sick
lady
smiled
at
once
and
put
out
her
hand
but
it
was
her
left
one
oh
no
said
hugh
with
a
laugh
i
never
in
all
my
life
have
taken
any
one
left
hand
and
beautiful
as
yours
is
i
wo
break
my
habit
by
beginning
now
and
here
reluctantly
and
as
if
in
pain
the
sick
lady
put
out
her
hand
it
was
bandaged
the
mystery
was
now
cleared
up
the
two
sisters
were
cats
by
the
help
of
bad
fairies
they
had
changed
their
forms
and
were
the
real
robbers
hugh
seized
the
hand
of
the
other
sister
and
made
a
little
cut
in
it
from
which
a
few
drops
of
blood
flowed
but
the
spell
was
over
henceforth
said
hugh
you
are
both
harmless
and
i
trust
you
will
both
be
honest
women
and
they
were
from
that
day
they
were
like
other
women
and
kept
one
of
the
best
of
those
inns
clean
tidy
comfortable
and
at
modest
prices
for
which
wales
is
or
was
noted
neither
as
cats
with
paws
nor
landladies
with
soaring
bills
did
they
ever
rob
travelers
again
iv
how
the
cymry
land
became
inhabited
in
all
britain
no
wolf
roams
wild
and
the
deer
are
all
tame
yet
in
the
early
ages
when
human
beings
had
not
yet
come
into
the
land
the
swamps
and
forests
were
full
of
very
savage
animals
there
were
bears
and
wolves
by
the
thousand
besides
lions
and
the
woolly
rhinoceros
tigers
with
terrible
teeth
like
sabres
beavers
built
their
dams
over
the
little
rivers
and
the
great
horned
oxen
were
very
common
then
the
mountains
were
higher
and
the
woods
denser
many
of
the
animals
lived
in
caves
and
there
were
billions
of
bees
and
a
great
many
butterflies
in
the
bogs
were
ferns
of
giant
size
amid
which
terrible
monsters
hid
that
were
always
ready
for
a
fight
or
a
frolic
in
so
beautiful
a
land
it
seemed
a
pity
that
there
were
no
men
and
women
no
boys
or
girls
and
no
babies
yet
the
noble
race
of
the
cymry
whom
we
call
the
welsh
were
already
in
europe
and
lived
in
the
summer
land
in
the
south
a
great
benefactor
was
born
among
them
who
grew
up
to
be
a
wonderfully
wise
man
and
taught
his
people
the
use
of
bows
and
arrows
he
made
laws
by
which
the
different
tribes
stopped
their
continual
fighting
and
quarrels
and
united
for
the
common
good
of
all
he
persuaded
them
to
take
family
names
he
invented
the
plow
and
showed
them
how
to
use
it
making
furrows
in
which
to
plant
grain
when
the
people
found
that
they
could
get
things
to
eat
right
out
of
the
ground
from
the
seed
they
had
planted
their
children
were
wild
with
joy
no
people
ever
loved
babies
more
than
these
cymry
folk
and
it
was
they
who
invented
the
cradle
this
saved
the
mothers
many
a
burden
for
each
woman
had
besides
rearing
the
children
to
work
for
and
wait
on
her
husband
he
was
the
warrior
and
hunter
and
she
did
most
of
the
labor
in
both
the
house
and
the
field
when
there
were
many
little
brats
to
look
after
a
cradle
was
a
real
help
to
her
in
those
days
brat
was
the
general
name
for
little
folks
there
were
good
laws
about
women
especially
for
their
protection
any
rough
or
brutish
fellow
was
fined
heavily
or
publicly
punished
for
striking
one
of
them
by
and
by
this
great
benefactor
encouraged
his
people
to
the
brave
adventure
and
led
them
in
crossing
the
sea
to
britain
men
had
not
yet
learned
to
build
boats
with
prow
or
stern
with
keels
and
masts
or
with
sails
rudders
or
oars
or
much
less
to
put
engines
in
their
bowels
or
iron
chimneys
for
smoke
stacks
by
which
we
see
the
mighty
ships
driven
across
the
ocean
without
regard
to
wind
or
tide
this
great
benefactor
taught
his
people
to
make
coracles
and
on
these
the
whole
tribe
of
thousands
of
cymric
folk
crossed
over
into
britain
landing
in
cornwall
the
old
name
of
this
shire
meant
the
horn
of
gallia
or
wallia
as
the
new
land
was
later
named
we
think
of
cornwall
as
the
big
toe
of
the
mother
land
these
first
comers
called
it
a
horn
it
was
a
funny
sight
to
see
these
coracles
which
they
named
after
their
own
round
bodies
the
men
went
down
to
the
riverside
or
the
sea
shore
and
with
their
stone
hatchets
they
chopped
down
trees
they
cut
the
reeds
and
osiers
peeled
the
willow
branches
and
wove
great
baskets
shaped
like
bowls
in
this
work
the
women
helped
the
men
the
coracle
was
made
strong
by
a
wooden
frame
fixed
inside
round
the
edge
and
by
two
cross
boards
which
also
served
as
seats
then
they
turned
the
wicker
frame
upside
down
and
stretched
the
hides
of
animals
over
the
whole
frame
and
bottom
with
pitch
gum
or
grease
they
covered
up
the
cracks
or
seams
then
they
shaped
paddles
out
of
wood
when
the
coracle
floated
on
the
water
the
whole
family
daddy
mammy
kiddies
and
any
old
aunts
or
uncles
or
granddaddies
got
into
it
they
waited
for
the
wind
to
blow
from
the
south
over
to
the
northern
land
at
first
the
coracle
spun
round
and
round
but
by
and
by
each
daddy
could
by
rowing
or
paddling
make
the
thing
go
straight
ahead
so
finally
all
arrived
in
the
land
now
called
great
britain
though
sugar
was
not
then
known
or
for
a
thousand
years
later
the
first
thing
they
noticed
was
the
enormous
number
of
bees
when
they
searched
they
found
the
rock
caves
and
hollow
trees
full
of
honey
which
had
accumulated
for
generations
every
once
in
a
while
the
bears
that
so
like
sweet
things
found
out
the
hiding
place
of
the
bees
and
ate
up
the
honey
the
children
were
very
happy
in
sucking
the
honey
comb
and
the
mothers
made
candles
out
of
the
beeswax
the
new
comers
named
the
country
honey
island
the
brave
cymry
men
had
battles
with
the
darker
skinned
people
who
were
already
there
when
any
one
young
or
old
died
their
friends
and
relatives
sat
up
all
night
guarding
the
body
against
wild
beasts
or
savage
men
this
grew
to
be
a
settled
custom
and
such
a
meeting
was
called
a
wake
everyone
present
did
keep
awake
and
often
in
a
very
lively
way
as
the
cymry
multiplied
they
built
many
or
towns
all
over
the
land
are
names
ending
in
like
london
or
croydon
showing
where
these
villages
were
but
while
occupied
in
things
for
the
body
their
great
ruler
did
not
neglect
matters
of
the
mind
he
found
that
some
of
his
people
had
good
voices
and
loved
to
sing
others
delighted
in
making
poetry
so
he
invented
or
improved
the
harp
and
fixed
the
rules
of
verse
and
song
thus
ages
before
writing
was
known
the
cymry
preserved
their
history
and
handed
down
what
the
wise
ones
taught
men
might
be
born
live
and
die
come
and
go
like
leaves
on
the
trees
which
expand
in
the
springtime
and
fall
in
the
autumn
but
their
songs
and
poetry
and
noble
language
never
die
even
the
cymry
love
the
speech
of
their
fathers
almost
as
well
as
they
love
their
native
land
yet
things
were
not
always
lovely
in
honey
land
or
as
sweet
as
sugar
as
the
tribes
scattered
far
apart
to
settle
in
this
or
that
valley
some
had
fish
but
no
salt
and
others
had
plenty
of
salt
but
no
fish
some
had
all
the
venison
and
bear
meat
they
wanted
but
no
barley
or
oats
the
hill
men
needed
what
the
men
on
the
seashore
could
supply
from
their
sheep
and
oxen
they
got
wool
and
leather
and
from
the
wild
beasts
fur
to
keep
warm
in
winter
so
many
of
them
grew
expert
in
trade
soon
there
were
among
them
some
very
rich
men
who
were
the
chiefs
of
the
tribes
in
time
hundreds
of
others
learned
how
to
traffic
among
the
tribes
and
swap
or
barter
their
goods
for
as
yet
there
were
no
coins
for
money
or
bank
bills
so
they
established
markets
or
fairs
to
which
the
girls
and
boys
liked
to
go
and
sell
their
eggs
and
chickens
for
when
the
wolves
and
foxes
were
killed
off
sheep
and
geese
multiplied
but
what
hindered
the
peace
of
the
land
were
the
feuds
or
quarrels
because
the
men
of
one
tribe
thought
they
were
braver
or
better
looking
than
those
in
the
other
tribe
the
women
were
very
apt
to
boast
that
they
wore
their
clothes
which
were
made
of
fox
and
weasel
skins
more
gracefully
than
those
in
the
tribe
next
to
them
so
there
was
much
snarling
and
quarreling
in
cymric
land
the
people
were
too
much
like
naughty
children
or
when
kiddies
are
not
taught
good
manners
to
speak
gently
and
to
be
kind
one
to
the
other
one
of
the
worst
quarrels
broke
out
because
in
one
tribe
there
were
too
many
maidens
and
not
enough
young
men
for
husbands
this
was
bad
for
the
men
for
it
spoiled
them
they
had
too
many
women
to
wait
on
them
and
they
grew
to
be
very
selfish
in
what
might
be
the
next
tribe
the
trouble
was
the
other
way
there
were
too
many
boys
a
surplus
of
men
and
not
nearly
enough
girls
to
go
round
when
any
young
fellow
moping
out
his
life
alone
and
anxious
for
a
wife
went
in
the
next
tribe
or
in
their
vale
or
on
their
hill
top
he
was
usually
driven
off
with
stones
then
there
was
a
quarrel
between
the
two
tribes
any
young
girl
who
sneaked
out
at
night
to
meet
her
young
man
of
another
clan
was
when
caught
instantly
and
severely
spanked
then
with
her
best
clothes
taken
off
she
had
to
stand
tied
to
a
post
in
the
market
place
a
whole
day
her
hair
was
pulled
down
in
disorder
and
all
the
dogs
were
allowed
to
bark
at
her
the
girls
made
fun
of
the
poor
thing
while
they
all
rubbed
one
forefinger
over
the
other
pointed
at
her
and
cried
fie
for
shame
while
the
boys
called
her
hard
names
if
it
were
known
that
the
young
man
who
wanted
a
wife
had
visited
a
girl
in
the
other
tribe
his
spear
and
bow
and
arrows
were
taken
away
from
him
till
the
moon
was
full
the
other
boys
and
the
girls
treated
him
roughly
and
called
him
hard
names
but
he
dare
not
defend
himself
and
had
to
suffer
patiently
this
was
all
because
of
the
feud
between
the
two
tribes
this
went
on
until
the
maidens
in
the
valley
who
were
very
many
while
yet
lovely
and
attractive
became
very
lonely
and
miserable
while
the
young
men
all
splendid
hunters
and
warriors
multiplied
in
the
hill
country
they
were
wretched
in
mind
because
not
one
could
get
a
wife
for
all
the
maidens
in
their
own
tribe
were
already
engaged
or
had
been
mated
one
day
news
came
to
the
young
men
on
the
hill
top
that
the
valley
men
were
all
off
on
a
hunting
expedition
at
once
without
waiting
a
moment
the
poor
lonely
bachelors
plucked
up
courage
then
armed
with
ropes
and
straps
they
marched
in
a
body
to
the
village
in
the
valley
below
there
they
seized
each
man
a
girl
not
waiting
for
any
maid
to
comb
her
hair
or
put
on
a
new
frock
or
pack
up
her
clothes
or
carry
any
thing
out
of
her
home
and
made
off
with
her
as
fast
as
one
pair
of
legs
could
move
with
another
pair
on
top
at
first
this
looked
like
rough
treatment
for
a
lovely
girl
thus
to
be
strapped
to
a
brawny
big
fellow
but
after
a
while
the
girls
thought
it
was
great
fun
to
be
married
and
each
one
to
have
a
man
to
caress
and
fondle
and
scold
and
look
for
and
boss
around
for
each
wife
inside
of
her
own
hut
was
quite
able
to
rule
her
husband
every
one
of
these
new
wives
was
delighted
to
find
a
man
who
cared
so
much
for
her
as
to
come
after
her
and
risk
his
life
to
get
her
and
each
one
admired
her
new
brave
husband
yet
the
brides
knew
too
well
that
their
men
folks
fathers
and
brothers
uncles
and
cousins
would
soon
come
back
to
attempt
their
recapture
and
this
was
just
what
happened
when
a
runner
brought
to
the
valley
men
now
far
away
the
news
of
the
rape
of
their
daughters
the
hunters
at
once
ceased
chasing
the
deer
and
marched
quickly
back
to
get
the
girls
and
make
them
come
home
the
hill
men
saw
the
band
of
hunters
coming
after
their
daughters
they
at
once
took
their
new
wives
into
a
natural
rocky
fortress
on
the
top
of
a
precipice
which
overlooked
the
lake
this
stronghold
had
only
one
entrance
a
sort
of
gateway
of
rocks
in
front
of
which
was
a
long
steep
narrow
path
here
the
hill
men
stood
to
resist
the
attack
and
hold
their
prizes
it
was
a
case
of
a
very
few
defenders
assaulted
by
a
multitude
and
the
battle
was
long
and
bloody
the
hill
men
scorned
to
surrender
and
shot
their
arrows
and
hurled
their
javelins
with
desperate
valor
they
battled
all
day
from
sunrise
until
the
late
afternoon
when
shadows
began
to
lengthen
the
stars
one
by
one
came
out
and
both
parties
after
setting
sentinels
lay
down
to
rest
in
the
morning
again
charge
after
charge
was
made
sword
beat
against
shield
and
helmet
and
clouds
of
arrows
were
shot
by
the
archers
who
were
well
posted
in
favorable
situations
on
the
rocks
long
before
noon
the
field
below
was
dotted
and
the
narrow
pass
was
choked
with
dead
bodies
in
the
afternoon
after
a
short
rest
and
refreshed
with
food
the
valley
men
though
finding
that
only
four
of
the
hill
fighters
were
alive
stood
off
at
a
distance
and
with
their
long
bows
and
a
shower
of
arrows
left
not
one
to
breathe
now
thought
the
victors
we
shall
get
our
maidens
back
again
so
taking
their
time
to
wash
off
the
blood
and
dust
to
bind
up
their
wounds
and
to
eat
their
supper
they
thought
it
would
be
an
easy
job
to
load
up
all
the
girls
on
their
and
carry
them
home
but
the
valley
brides
thus
suddenly
made
widows
were
too
true
to
their
brave
husbands
so
when
they
had
seen
the
last
of
their
lovers
quiet
in
death
they
stripped
off
all
their
ornaments
and
fur
robes
until
all
stood
together
each
clad
in
her
own
innocence
as
pure
in
their
purpose
as
if
they
were
a
company
of
druid
priestesses
then
chanting
their
death
song
they
marched
in
procession
to
the
tall
cliff
that
rose
sheer
out
of
the
water
one
by
one
each
uttering
the
name
of
her
beloved
leaped
into
the
waves
men
at
a
distance
knowing
nothing
of
the
fight
and
sailors
and
fishermen
far
off
on
the
water
thought
that
a
flock
of
white
birds
were
swooping
down
from
their
eyrie
into
the
sea
to
get
their
food
from
the
fishes
but
when
none
rose
up
above
the
waters
they
understood
and
later
heard
the
whole
story
of
the
valor
of
the
men
and
the
devotion
of
the
women
the
solemn
silence
of
night
soon
brooded
over
the
scene
the
men
of
the
valley
stayed
only
long
enough
to
bury
their
own
dead
then
they
marched
home
and
their
houses
were
filled
with
mourning
yet
they
admired
the
noble
sacrifice
of
their
daughters
and
were
proud
of
them
afterwards
they
raised
stone
monuments
on
the
field
of
slaughter
this
water
is
called
the
lake
of
the
maidens
and
the
great
stones
seen
near
the
beach
are
the
memorials
marking
the
place
of
the
slain
in
battle
during
many
centuries
the
ancient
custom
of
capturing
the
bride
with
resistance
from
her
male
relatives
was
vigorously
kept
up
in
the
course
of
time
however
this
was
turned
into
a
mimic
play
with
much
fun
and
merriment
yet
the
girls
appear
to
like
it
and
some
even
complain
if
it
is
not
rough
enough
to
seem
almost
real
v
the
boy
that
was
named
trouble
in
one
of
the
many
or
places
with
this
name
in
ancient
and
wales
there
was
a
man
who
had
one
of
the
most
beautiful
mares
in
all
the
world
yet
great
misfortunes
befell
both
this
mare
and
her
owner
every
night
on
the
first
of
may
the
mare
gave
birth
to
a
pretty
little
colt
yet
no
one
ever
saw
or
could
ever
tell
what
became
of
any
one
or
all
of
the
colts
each
and
all
and
one
by
one
they
disappeared
nobody
knew
where
they
were
or
went
or
what
had
become
of
them
at
last
the
owner
who
had
no
children
and
loved
little
horses
determined
not
to
lose
another
he
girded
on
his
sword
and
with
his
trusty
spear
stood
guard
all
night
in
the
stable
to
catch
the
mortal
robber
as
he
supposed
he
must
be
when
on
this
same
night
of
may
first
the
mare
foaled
again
and
the
colt
stood
up
on
its
long
legs
the
man
greatly
admired
the
young
creature
it
looked
already
as
if
it
could
with
its
own
legs
run
away
and
escape
from
any
wolf
that
should
chase
it
hoping
to
eat
it
up
but
at
this
moment
a
great
noise
was
heard
outside
the
stable
the
next
moment
a
long
arm
with
a
claw
at
the
end
of
it
was
poked
through
the
to
seize
the
colt
instantly
the
man
drew
his
sword
and
with
one
blow
the
claw
part
of
the
arm
was
cut
off
and
it
dropped
inside
with
the
colt
hearing
a
great
cry
and
tumult
outside
the
owner
of
the
mare
rushed
forth
into
the
darkness
but
though
he
heard
howls
of
pain
he
could
see
nothing
so
he
returned
there
at
the
door
he
found
a
baby
with
hair
as
yellow
as
gold
smiling
at
him
besides
its
swaddling
clothes
it
was
wrapped
up
in
satin
as
it
was
still
night
the
man
took
the
infant
to
his
bed
and
laid
it
alongside
of
his
wife
who
was
asleep
now
this
good
woman
loved
children
though
she
had
none
of
her
own
and
so
when
she
woke
up
in
the
morning
and
saw
what
was
beside
her
she
was
very
happy
then
she
resolved
to
pretend
that
it
was
her
own
so
she
told
her
women
that
she
had
borne
the
child
and
they
called
him
gwri
of
the
golden
hair
the
boy
baby
grew
up
fast
and
when
only
two
years
old
was
as
strong
as
most
children
are
at
six
soon
he
was
able
to
ride
the
colt
that
had
been
born
on
the
may
night
and
the
two
were
as
playmates
together
now
it
chanced
the
man
had
heard
the
tale
of
queen
rhiannon
wife
of
powell
prince
of
dyfed
she
had
become
the
mother
of
a
baby
boy
but
it
was
stolen
from
her
at
night
the
six
serving
women
whose
duty
it
was
to
attend
to
the
queen
and
guard
her
child
were
lazy
and
had
neglected
their
duty
they
were
asleep
when
the
baby
was
stolen
away
to
excuse
themselves
and
be
saved
from
punishment
they
invented
a
lying
story
they
declared
that
rhiannon
had
devoured
the
child
her
own
baby
the
wise
men
of
the
court
believed
the
story
which
the
six
wicked
women
had
told
and
rhiannon
the
queen
though
innocent
was
condemned
to
do
penance
she
was
to
serve
as
a
porter
to
carry
visitors
and
their
baggage
from
out
doors
into
the
castle
every
day
for
many
months
through
the
hours
of
daylight
she
stood
in
public
disgrace
in
front
of
the
castle
of
narberth
at
the
stone
block
on
which
riders
on
horses
dismounted
from
the
saddle
when
anyone
got
off
at
the
gate
she
had
to
carry
him
or
her
on
her
back
into
the
hall
as
the
boy
grew
up
his
foster
father
scanned
his
features
closely
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
made
up
his
mind
that
powell
was
his
father
and
rhiannon
was
his
mother
one
day
with
the
boy
riding
on
his
colt
and
with
two
knights
keeping
him
company
the
owner
of
the
mare
came
near
the
castle
of
narberth
there
they
saw
the
beautiful
rhiannon
sitting
on
the
horse
block
at
the
gate
when
they
were
about
to
dismount
from
their
horses
the
lovely
woman
spoke
to
them
thus
chieftains
go
no
further
thus
i
will
carry
everyone
of
you
on
my
back
into
the
palace
seeing
their
looks
of
astonishment
she
explained
this
is
my
penance
for
the
charge
brought
against
me
of
slaying
my
son
and
devouring
him
one
and
all
the
four
refused
to
be
carried
and
went
into
the
castle
on
their
own
feet
there
powell
the
prince
welcomed
them
and
made
a
feast
in
their
honor
it
being
night
rhiannon
sat
beside
him
after
dinner
when
the
time
for
story
telling
had
come
the
chief
guest
told
the
tale
of
his
mare
and
the
colt
and
how
he
cut
the
clawed
hand
and
then
found
the
boy
on
the
doorstep
then
to
the
joy
and
surprise
of
all
the
owner
of
the
mare
putting
the
boy
before
rhiannon
cried
out
behold
lady
here
is
thy
son
and
whoever
they
were
who
told
the
story
and
lied
about
your
devouring
your
own
child
have
done
you
a
grievous
wrong
everyone
at
the
table
looked
at
the
boy
and
all
recognized
the
lad
at
once
as
the
child
of
powell
and
rhiannon
here
ends
my
trouble
pryderi
cried
out
rhiannon
thereupon
one
of
the
chiefs
said
well
hast
thou
named
thy
child
and
henceforth
pryderi
was
his
name
soon
it
was
made
known
by
the
vision
and
word
of
the
bards
and
seers
that
all
the
mischief
had
been
wrought
by
wicked
fairies
and
that
the
six
serving
women
had
been
under
their
spell
when
they
lied
about
the
queen
powell
the
was
so
happy
that
he
offered
the
man
of
rich
gifts
of
horses
jewels
and
dogs
but
this
good
man
felt
repaid
in
delivering
a
pure
woman
and
loving
mother
from
undeserved
shame
and
disgrace
by
wisdom
and
honesty
according
to
common
duty
as
for
pryderi
he
was
educated
as
a
king
son
ought
to
be
in
all
gentle
arts
and
was
trained
in
all
manly
exercises
after
his
father
died
pryderi
became
ruler
of
the
realm
he
married
kieva
the
daughter
of
a
powerful
chieftain
who
had
a
pedigree
as
long
as
the
bridle
used
to
drive
a
chariot
it
reached
back
to
prince
casnar
of
britain
pryderi
had
many
adventures
which
are
told
in
the
mabinogian
which
is
the
great
storehouse
of
welsh
hero
wonder
and
fairy
tales
vi
the
golden
harp
morgan
is
one
of
the
oldest
names
in
cymric
land
it
means
one
who
lives
near
the
sea
every
day
for
centuries
past
tens
of
thousands
of
welsh
folks
have
looked
out
on
the
great
blue
plain
of
salt
water
it
is
just
as
true
also
that
there
are
all
sorts
of
morgans
one
of
these
named
taffy
was
like
nearly
all
welshmen
in
that
he
was
very
fond
of
singing
the
trouble
in
his
case
however
was
that
no
one
but
himself
loved
to
hear
his
voice
which
was
very
disagreeable
yet
of
the
sounds
which
he
himself
made
with
voice
or
instrument
he
was
an
intense
admirer
nobody
could
persuade
him
that
his
music
was
poor
and
his
voice
rough
he
always
refused
to
improve
now
in
wales
the
bard
or
poet
who
makes
up
his
poetry
or
song
as
he
goes
along
is
a
very
important
person
and
it
is
not
well
to
offend
one
of
these
gentlemen
in
french
they
call
such
a
person
by
a
very
long
name
the
improvisator
these
poets
have
sharp
tongues
and
often
say
hard
things
about
people
whom
they
do
not
like
if
they
used
whetstones
or
stropped
their
tongues
on
leather
as
men
do
their
razors
to
give
them
a
keener
edge
their
words
could
not
cut
more
terribly
now
on
one
occasion
morgan
had
offended
one
of
these
bards
it
was
while
the
poetic
gentleman
was
passing
by
taffy
house
he
heard
the
jolly
fellow
inside
singing
first
at
the
top
and
then
at
the
bottom
of
the
scale
he
would
drop
his
voice
down
on
the
low
notes
and
then
again
rise
to
the
highest
until
it
ended
in
a
screech
someone
on
the
street
asked
the
poet
how
he
liked
the
music
which
he
had
heard
inside
music
replied
the
bard
with
a
sneer
is
that
what
morgan
is
trying
why
i
thought
it
was
first
the
lowing
of
an
aged
cow
and
then
the
yelping
of
a
blind
dog
unable
to
find
its
way
do
you
call
that
music
the
truth
was
that
when
the
soloist
had
so
filled
himself
with
strong
ale
that
his
brain
was
fuddled
then
it
was
hard
to
tell
just
what
kind
of
a
noise
he
was
making
it
took
a
wise
man
to
discover
the
tune
if
there
was
any
one
evening
when
morgan
thought
his
singing
unusually
fine
and
felt
sorry
that
no
one
heard
him
he
heard
a
knock
illustration
the
more
morgan
played
the
madder
the
dance
instead
of
going
to
the
door
to
inquire
or
welcome
the
visitor
he
yelled
out
come
in
the
door
opened
and
there
stood
three
tired
looking
strangers
they
appeared
to
be
travelers
one
of
them
said
kind
sir
we
are
weary
and
worn
and
would
be
glad
of
a
morsel
of
bread
if
you
can
give
us
a
little
food
we
shall
not
trouble
you
further
is
that
all
said
morgan
see
there
the
loaf
and
the
cheese
with
a
knife
beside
them
take
what
you
want
and
fill
your
bags
no
man
shall
ever
say
that
taffy
morgan
denied
anyone
food
when
he
had
any
himself
whereupon
the
three
travelers
sat
down
and
began
to
eat
meanwhile
without
being
invited
to
do
so
their
host
began
to
sing
for
them
now
the
three
travelers
were
fairies
in
disguise
they
were
journeying
over
the
country
from
cottage
to
cottage
visiting
the
people
they
came
to
reward
all
who
gave
them
a
welcome
and
were
kind
to
them
but
to
vex
and
play
tricks
upon
those
who
were
stingy
bad
tempered
or
of
sour
disposition
turning
to
taffy
before
taking
leave
one
of
them
said
you
have
been
good
to
us
and
we
are
grateful
now
what
can
we
do
for
you
we
have
power
to
grant
anything
you
may
desire
please
tell
us
what
you
would
like
most
at
this
taffy
looked
hard
in
the
faces
of
the
three
strangers
to
see
if
one
of
them
was
the
bard
who
had
likened
his
voice
in
its
ups
and
downs
to
a
cow
and
a
blind
dog
not
seeing
any
familiar
face
he
plucked
up
his
courage
and
said
if
you
are
not
making
fun
of
me
i
take
from
you
a
harp
and
if
i
can
have
my
wish
in
full
i
want
one
that
will
play
only
lively
tunes
no
sad
music
for
me
here
morgan
stopped
again
he
searched
their
faces
to
see
if
they
were
laughing
at
him
and
then
proceeded
and
something
else
if
i
can
have
it
but
it
really
the
same
thing
i
am
asking
for
speak
on
we
are
ready
to
do
what
you
wish
answered
the
leader
i
want
a
harp
which
no
matter
how
badly
i
may
play
will
sound
out
sweet
and
jolly
music
say
no
more
said
the
leader
who
waved
his
hand
there
was
a
flood
of
light
and
to
morgan
amazement
there
stood
on
the
floor
a
golden
harp
but
where
were
the
three
travelers
they
had
disappeared
in
a
flash
hardly
able
to
believe
his
own
eyes
it
now
dawned
upon
him
that
his
visitors
were
fairies
he
sat
down
back
of
the
harp
and
made
ready
to
sweep
the
strings
he
hardly
knew
whether
or
not
he
touched
the
instrument
but
there
rolled
out
volumes
of
lively
music
as
if
the
harp
itself
were
mad
the
tune
was
wild
and
such
as
would
set
the
feet
of
young
folks
agoing
even
in
church
as
taffy
fingers
seemed
every
moment
to
become
more
skillful
the
livelier
the
music
increased
until
the
very
dishes
rattled
on
the
cupboard
as
if
they
wanted
to
join
in
even
the
chair
looked
as
if
about
to
dance
just
then
morgan
wife
and
some
neighbors
entered
the
house
immediately
the
whole
party
one
and
all
began
dancing
in
the
jolliest
way
for
hours
they
kept
up
the
mad
whirl
yet
all
the
while
taffy
seemed
happier
and
the
women
the
merrier
no
telegraph
ever
carried
the
news
faster
all
over
the
region
that
morgan
had
a
wonderful
harp
all
the
grass
in
front
of
the
house
was
soon
worn
away
by
the
crowds
that
came
to
hear
and
dance
as
soon
as
taffy
touched
the
harp
strings
the
feet
of
everyone
young
and
old
began
shuffling
nor
could
anyone
stop
so
long
as
morgan
played
even
very
old
lame
and
people
joined
in
several
old
women
whom
nobody
had
ever
prevailed
upon
to
get
out
of
their
chairs
were
cured
of
their
rheumatism
such
unusual
exercise
was
severe
for
them
but
it
seemed
to
be
healthful
a
shrewd
monk
the
business
manager
of
the
monastery
near
by
wanted
to
buy
morgan
house
set
up
a
sanatarium
and
advertise
it
as
a
holy
place
he
hoped
thus
to
draw
pilgrims
to
it
and
get
for
it
a
great
reputation
as
a
healing
place
for
the
lame
and
the
halt
the
palsied
and
the
rheumatic
thus
the
monastery
would
be
enriched
and
all
the
monks
get
fat
but
taffy
was
a
fellow
who
cared
little
about
money
and
would
not
sell
for
with
his
harp
he
enjoyed
both
fun
and
fame
one
day
in
the
crowd
that
stood
around
his
door
waiting
to
begin
to
hop
and
whirl
morgan
espied
the
bard
who
had
compared
his
voice
to
a
cow
and
a
cur
the
bard
had
come
to
see
whether
the
stories
about
the
harp
were
true
or
not
he
found
to
his
own
discomfort
what
was
the
fact
and
the
reality
which
were
not
very
convenient
for
him
as
soon
as
the
harp
music
began
his
feet
began
to
go
up
and
his
legs
to
kick
and
whirl
the
more
morgan
played
the
madder
the
dance
and
the
wilder
the
antics
of
the
crowd
and
in
these
the
bard
had
to
join
for
he
could
not
help
himself
soon
they
all
began
to
spin
round
and
round
on
the
flagstones
fronting
the
door
as
if
crazy
they
broke
the
paling
of
the
garden
fence
they
came
into
the
house
and
knocked
over
the
chairs
and
sofa
even
when
they
cracked
their
shins
against
the
wood
they
bumped
their
heads
against
the
walls
and
ceiling
and
some
even
scrambled
over
the
roof
and
down
again
the
bard
could
no
more
stop
his
weary
legs
than
could
the
other
lunatics
to
morgan
his
revenge
was
so
sweet
that
he
kept
on
until
the
legs
snapped
and
he
fell
down
on
top
of
people
that
had
tumbled
from
shear
weariness
because
no
more
strength
was
left
in
them
meanwhile
morgan
laughed
until
his
jaws
were
tired
and
his
stomach
muscles
ached
but
no
sooner
did
he
take
his
fingers
off
the
strings
to
rest
them
than
he
opened
his
eyes
in
wonder
for
in
a
flash
the
harp
had
disappeared
he
had
made
a
bad
use
of
the
fairies
gift
and
they
were
displeased
so
both
the
monk
and
morgan
felt
sorry
yet
the
grass
grew
again
when
the
quondam
harper
and
singer
ceased
desolating
the
air
with
his
quavers
the
air
seemed
sweeter
to
breathe
because
of
the
silence
however
the
fairies
kept
on
doing
good
to
the
people
of
good
will
and
some
of
the
sweetest
singers
in
wales
come
from
the
poorest
homes
vii
the
great
red
dragon
of
wales
every
old
country
that
has
won
fame
in
history
and
built
up
a
civilization
of
its
own
has
a
national
flower
besides
this
some
living
creature
bird
or
beast
or
it
may
be
a
fish
is
on
its
flag
in
places
of
honor
it
stands
as
the
emblem
of
the
nation
that
is
of
the
people
apart
from
the
land
they
live
on
besides
flag
and
symbol
it
has
a
motto
that
of
wales
is
awake
it
is
light
now
because
the
glorious
stories
of
wales
scotland
and
ireland
have
been
nearly
lost
in
that
of
mighty
england
men
have
at
times
almost
forgotten
about
the
leek
the
thistle
and
the
shamrock
which
stand
for
the
other
three
divisions
of
the
british
isles
yet
each
of
these
peoples
has
a
history
as
noble
as
that
of
which
the
rose
and
the
lion
are
the
emblems
each
has
also
its
patron
saint
and
civilizer
so
we
have
saint
george
saint
david
saint
andrew
and
saint
patrick
all
of
them
heroes
on
the
union
flag
or
standard
of
the
united
kingdom
we
see
their
three
crosses
the
lion
of
england
the
harp
of
ireland
the
thistle
of
scotland
and
the
red
dragon
of
wales
represent
the
four
peoples
in
the
british
isles
each
with
its
own
speech
traditions
and
emblems
yet
all
in
unity
and
in
loyalty
none
excelling
the
welsh
whose
symbol
is
the
red
dragon
in
classic
phrase
we
talk
of
albion
scotia
cymry
and
hibernia
but
why
red
almost
all
the
other
dragons
in
the
world
are
white
or
yellow
green
or
purple
blue
or
pink
why
a
fiery
red
color
like
that
of
mars
borne
on
the
banners
of
the
welsh
archers
who
in
old
days
won
the
battles
of
crecy
and
agincourt
and
now
seen
on
the
crests
on
the
town
halls
and
city
flags
in
heraldry
and
in
art
the
red
dragon
is
as
rampant
as
when
king
arthur
sat
with
his
knights
at
the
round
table
the
red
dragon
has
four
claws
a
long
barbed
tongue
and
tail
ending
like
an
arrow
head
with
its
wide
wings
unfolded
it
guards
those
ancient
liberties
which
neither
saxon
nor
norman
nor
german
nor
kings
on
the
throne
whether
foolish
or
wise
have
ever
been
able
to
take
away
no
people
on
earth
combine
so
handsomely
loyal
freedom
and
the
larger
patriotism
or
hold
in
purer
loyalty
to
the
union
of
hearts
and
hands
in
the
british
empire
which
the
sovereign
represents
as
do
the
welsh
the
welsh
are
the
oldest
of
the
british
peoples
they
preserve
the
language
of
the
druids
bards
and
chiefs
of
primeval
ages
which
go
back
and
far
beyond
any
royal
line
in
europe
while
most
of
their
fairy
tales
are
and
beyond
the
dating
why
the
cymric
dragon
is
red
is
thus
told
from
times
beyond
human
record
it
was
in
those
early
days
after
the
romans
in
the
south
had
left
the
island
and
the
cymric
king
vortigern
was
hard
pressed
by
the
picts
and
scots
of
the
north
to
his
aid
he
invited
over
from
beyond
the
north
sea
or
german
ocean
the
tribes
called
the
long
knives
or
saxons
to
help
him
but
once
on
the
big
island
these
friends
became
enemies
and
would
not
go
back
they
wanted
to
possess
all
britain
vortigern
thought
this
was
treachery
knowing
that
the
long
knives
would
soon
attack
him
he
called
his
twelve
wise
men
together
for
their
advice
with
one
voice
they
advised
him
to
retreat
westward
behind
the
mountains
into
cymry
there
he
must
build
a
strong
fortress
and
there
defy
his
enemies
so
the
saxons
who
were
germans
thought
they
had
driven
the
cymry
beyond
the
western
borders
of
the
country
which
was
later
called
england
and
into
what
they
named
the
foreign
or
welsh
parts
centuries
afterwards
this
land
received
the
name
of
wales
people
in
europe
spoke
of
galatians
wallachians
belgians
walloons
alsatians
and
others
as
welsh
they
called
the
new
fruit
imported
from
asia
walnuts
but
the
names
wales
and
welsh
were
unheard
of
until
after
the
fifth
century
the
place
chosen
for
the
fortified
city
of
the
cymry
was
among
the
mountains
from
all
over
his
realm
the
king
sent
for
masons
and
carpenters
and
collected
the
materials
for
building
then
a
solemn
invocation
was
made
to
the
gods
by
the
druid
priests
these
grand
looking
old
men
were
robed
in
white
with
long
snowy
beards
falling
over
their
breasts
and
they
had
oxen
drawing
their
chariot
with
a
silver
knife
they
cut
the
mistletoe
from
the
hailing
it
as
a
sign
of
favor
from
god
then
with
harp
music
and
song
they
dedicated
the
spot
as
a
stronghold
of
the
cymric
nation
then
the
king
set
the
diggers
to
work
he
promised
a
rich
reward
to
those
men
of
the
pick
and
shovel
who
should
dig
the
fastest
and
throw
up
the
most
dirt
so
that
the
masons
could
at
the
earliest
moment
begin
their
part
of
the
work
but
it
all
turned
out
differently
from
what
the
king
expected
some
dragon
or
powerful
being
underground
must
have
been
offended
by
this
invasion
of
his
domain
for
the
next
morning
they
saw
that
everything
in
the
form
of
stone
timber
iron
or
tools
had
disappeared
during
the
night
it
looked
as
if
an
earthquake
had
swallowed
them
all
up
both
king
and
seers
priests
and
bards
were
greatly
puzzled
at
this
however
not
being
able
to
account
for
it
and
the
saxons
likely
to
march
on
them
at
any
time
the
sovereign
set
the
diggers
at
work
and
again
collected
more
wood
and
stone
this
time
even
the
women
helped
not
only
to
cook
the
food
but
to
drag
the
logs
and
stones
they
were
even
ready
to
cut
off
their
beautiful
long
hair
to
make
ropes
if
necessary
but
in
the
morning
all
had
again
disappeared
as
if
swept
by
a
tempest
the
ground
was
bare
nevertheless
all
hands
began
again
for
all
hearts
were
united
for
the
third
time
the
work
proceeded
yet
when
the
sun
rose
next
morning
there
was
not
even
a
trace
of
either
material
or
labor
what
was
the
matter
had
some
dragon
swallowed
everything
up
vortigern
again
summoned
his
twelve
wise
men
to
meet
in
council
and
to
inquire
concerning
the
cause
of
the
marvel
and
to
decide
what
was
to
be
done
after
long
deliberation
while
all
the
workmen
and
people
outside
waited
for
their
verdict
the
wise
men
agreed
upon
a
remedy
now
in
ancient
times
it
was
a
custom
all
over
the
world
notably
in
china
and
japan
and
among
our
ancestors
that
when
a
new
castle
or
bridge
was
to
be
built
they
sacrificed
a
human
being
this
was
done
either
by
walling
up
the
victim
while
alive
or
by
mixing
his
or
her
blood
with
the
cement
used
in
the
walls
often
it
was
a
virgin
or
a
little
child
thus
chosen
by
lot
and
made
to
die
the
one
for
the
many
the
idea
was
not
only
to
ward
off
the
anger
of
the
spirits
of
the
air
or
to
appease
the
dragons
under
ground
but
also
to
make
the
workmen
do
their
best
work
faithfully
so
that
the
foundation
should
be
sure
and
the
edifice
withstand
the
storm
the
wind
and
the
earthquake
shocks
so
nobody
was
surprised
or
raised
his
eyebrows
or
shook
his
head
or
pursed
up
his
lips
when
the
king
announced
that
what
the
wise
men
declared
must
be
done
and
that
quickly
nevertheless
many
a
mother
hugged
her
darling
more
closely
to
her
bosom
and
fathers
feared
for
their
sons
or
daughters
lest
one
of
these
their
own
should
be
chosen
as
the
victim
to
be
slain
king
vortigern
had
the
long
horn
blown
for
perfect
silence
and
then
he
spoke
a
child
must
be
found
who
was
born
without
a
father
he
must
be
brought
here
and
be
solemnly
put
to
death
then
his
blood
will
be
sprinkled
on
the
ground
and
the
citadel
will
be
built
securely
within
an
hour
swift
runners
were
seen
bounding
over
the
cymric
hills
they
were
dispatched
in
search
of
a
boy
without
a
father
and
a
large
reward
was
promised
to
the
young
man
who
found
what
was
wanted
so
into
every
part
of
the
cymric
land
the
searchers
went
one
messenger
noticed
some
boys
playing
ball
two
of
them
were
quarreling
coming
near
he
heard
one
say
to
the
other
oh
you
boy
without
a
father
nothing
good
will
ever
happen
to
you
this
must
be
the
one
looked
for
said
the
royal
messenger
to
himself
so
he
went
up
to
the
boy
who
had
been
thus
twitted
and
spoke
to
him
thus
do
mind
what
he
says
then
he
prophesied
great
things
if
he
would
go
along
with
him
the
boy
was
only
too
glad
to
go
and
the
next
day
the
lad
was
brought
before
king
vortigern
the
workmen
and
their
wives
and
children
numbering
thousands
had
assembled
for
the
solemn
ceremony
of
dedicating
the
ground
by
shedding
the
boy
blood
in
strained
attention
the
people
held
their
breath
the
boy
asked
the
king
why
have
your
servants
brought
me
to
this
place
then
the
sovereign
told
him
the
reason
and
the
boy
asked
who
instructed
you
to
do
this
my
wise
men
told
me
so
to
do
and
even
the
sovereign
of
the
land
obeys
his
wise
councilors
order
them
to
come
to
me
your
majesty
pleaded
the
boy
when
the
wise
men
appeared
the
boy
in
respectful
manner
inquired
of
them
thus
how
was
the
secret
of
my
life
revealed
to
you
please
speak
freely
and
declare
who
it
was
that
discovered
me
to
you
turning
to
the
king
the
boy
added
pardon
my
boldness
your
majesty
i
shall
soon
reveal
the
whole
matter
to
you
but
i
wish
first
to
question
your
advisers
i
want
them
to
tell
you
what
is
the
real
cause
and
reveal
if
they
can
what
is
hidden
here
underneath
the
ground
but
the
wise
men
were
confounded
they
could
not
tell
and
they
fully
confessed
their
ignorance
the
boy
then
said
there
is
a
pool
of
water
down
below
please
order
your
men
to
dig
for
it
at
once
the
spades
were
plied
by
strong
hands
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
workmen
saw
their
faces
reflected
as
in
a
looking
glass
there
was
a
pool
of
clear
water
there
turning
to
the
wise
men
the
boy
asked
before
all
now
tell
me
what
is
in
the
pool
as
ignorant
as
before
and
now
thoroughly
ashamed
the
wise
men
were
silent
your
majesty
i
can
tell
you
even
if
these
men
can
not
there
are
two
vases
in
the
pool
two
brave
men
leaped
down
into
the
pool
they
felt
around
and
brought
up
two
vases
as
the
boy
had
said
again
the
lad
put
a
question
to
the
wise
men
what
is
in
these
vases
once
more
those
who
professed
to
know
the
secrets
of
the
world
even
to
the
demanding
of
the
life
of
a
human
being
held
their
tongues
there
is
a
tent
in
them
said
the
boy
separate
them
and
you
will
find
it
so
by
the
king
command
a
soldier
thrust
in
his
hand
and
found
a
folded
tent
again
while
all
wondered
the
boy
was
in
command
of
the
situation
everything
seemed
so
reasonable
that
all
were
prompt
and
alert
to
serve
him
what
a
splendid
chief
and
general
he
would
make
to
lead
us
against
our
enemies
the
knives
whispered
one
soldier
to
another
what
is
in
the
tent
asked
the
boy
of
the
wise
men
not
one
of
the
twelve
knew
what
to
say
and
there
was
an
almost
painful
silence
i
will
tell
you
your
majesty
and
all
here
what
is
in
this
tent
there
are
two
serpents
one
white
and
one
red
unfold
the
tent
with
such
a
leader
no
soldier
was
afraid
nor
did
a
single
person
in
the
crowd
draw
back
two
stalwart
fellows
stepped
forward
to
open
the
tent
but
now
a
few
of
the
men
and
many
of
the
women
shrank
back
while
those
that
had
babies
or
little
folks
snatched
up
their
children
fearing
lest
the
poisonous
snakes
might
wriggle
towards
them
the
two
serpents
were
coiled
up
and
asleep
but
they
soon
showed
signs
of
waking
and
their
fiery
lidless
eyes
glared
at
the
people
now
your
majesty
and
all
here
be
you
the
witnesses
of
what
will
happen
let
the
king
and
wise
men
look
in
the
tent
at
this
moment
the
serpents
stretched
themselves
out
at
full
length
while
all
fell
back
giving
them
a
wide
circle
to
struggle
in
then
they
reared
their
heads
with
their
glittering
eyes
flashing
fire
they
began
to
struggle
with
each
other
the
white
one
rose
up
first
threw
the
red
one
into
the
middle
of
the
arena
and
then
pursued
him
to
the
edge
of
the
round
space
three
times
did
the
white
serpent
gain
the
victory
over
the
red
one
but
while
the
white
serpent
seemed
to
be
gloating
over
the
other
for
a
final
onset
the
red
one
gathering
strength
erected
its
head
and
struck
at
the
other
the
struggle
went
on
for
several
minutes
but
in
the
end
the
red
serpent
overcame
the
white
driving
it
first
out
of
the
circle
then
from
the
tent
and
into
the
pool
where
it
disappeared
while
the
victorious
red
one
moved
into
the
tent
again
when
the
tent
flap
was
opened
for
all
to
see
nothing
was
visible
except
a
red
dragon
for
the
victorious
serpent
had
turned
into
this
great
creature
which
combined
in
one
new
form
the
body
and
the
powers
of
bird
beast
reptile
and
fish
it
had
wings
to
fly
the
strongest
animal
strength
and
could
crawl
swim
and
live
in
either
water
or
air
or
on
the
earth
in
its
body
was
the
sum
total
of
all
life
then
in
the
presence
of
all
the
assembly
the
youth
turned
to
the
wise
men
to
explain
the
meaning
of
what
had
happened
but
not
a
word
did
they
speak
in
fact
their
faces
were
full
of
shame
before
the
great
crowd
now
your
majesty
let
me
reveal
to
you
the
meaning
of
this
mystery
speak
on
said
the
king
gratefully
this
pool
is
the
emblem
of
the
world
and
the
tent
is
that
of
your
kingdom
the
two
serpents
are
two
dragons
the
white
serpent
is
the
dragon
of
the
saxons
who
now
occupy
several
of
the
provinces
and
districts
of
britain
and
from
sea
to
sea
but
when
they
invade
our
soil
our
people
will
finally
drive
them
back
and
hold
fast
forever
their
beloved
cymric
land
but
you
must
choose
another
site
on
which
to
erect
your
castle
after
this
whenever
a
castle
was
to
be
built
no
more
human
victims
were
doomed
to
death
all
the
twelve
men
who
had
wanted
to
keep
up
the
old
cruel
custom
were
treated
as
deceivers
of
the
people
by
the
king
orders
they
were
all
put
to
death
and
buried
before
all
the
crowd
like
so
many
who
keep
alive
old
and
notions
by
means
of
deception
and
falsehood
these
men
are
remembered
only
by
the
twelve
mounds
which
rise
on
the
surface
of
the
field
hard
by
as
for
the
boy
he
became
a
great
magician
or
as
we
in
our
age
would
call
him
a
man
of
science
and
wisdom
named
merlin
he
lived
long
on
the
mountain
but
when
he
went
away
with
a
friend
he
placed
all
his
treasures
in
a
golden
cauldron
and
hid
them
in
a
cave
he
rolled
a
great
stone
over
its
mouth
then
with
sod
and
earth
he
covered
it
all
over
so
as
to
hide
it
from
view
his
purpose
was
to
leave
this
his
wealth
for
a
leader
who
in
some
future
generation
would
use
it
for
the
benefit
of
his
country
when
most
needed
this
special
person
will
be
a
youth
with
yellow
hair
and
blue
eyes
when
he
comes
to
denas
a
bell
will
ring
to
invite
him
into
the
cave
the
moment
his
foot
is
over
the
place
the
stone
of
entrance
will
open
of
its
own
accord
anyone
else
will
be
considered
an
intruder
and
it
will
not
be
possible
for
him
to
carry
away
the
treasure
viii
the
touch
of
clay
long
long
ago
before
the
cymry
came
into
the
beautiful
land
of
wales
there
were
people
living
in
caves
in
these
early
times
there
were
a
great
many
fairies
of
all
sorts
but
of
very
different
kinds
of
behavior
good
and
bad
it
was
in
this
age
of
the
world
that
fairies
got
an
idea
riveted
into
their
heads
which
nothing
not
even
hammers
chisels
or
crowbars
can
pry
up
neither
horse
power
nor
hydraulic
force
nor
bombs
nor
cannon
balls
nor
torpedoes
can
drive
it
out
it
is
a
settled
matter
of
opinion
in
fairy
land
that
compared
with
fairies
human
beings
are
very
stupid
the
fairies
think
that
mortals
are
dull
witted
and
awfully
slow
when
compared
to
the
smarter
and
more
nimble
fairies
that
are
always
up
to
date
in
doing
things
perhaps
the
following
story
will
help
explain
why
this
is
these
ancient
folks
who
lived
in
caves
could
not
possibly
know
some
things
that
are
like
a
b
c
to
the
fairies
of
for
the
welsh
fairies
king
puck
and
queen
mab
know
all
about
what
is
in
the
telegraphs
submarine
cables
and
wireless
telegraphy
of
puck
would
laugh
if
you
should
say
that
a
telephone
was
any
new
thing
to
him
long
ago
in
shakespeare
time
he
boasted
that
he
could
put
a
girdle
round
the
earth
in
forty
minutes
men
have
been
trying
ever
since
to
catch
up
with
him
but
they
have
not
gone
ahead
of
him
yet
if
only
three
hundred
years
ago
this
were
the
case
what
must
have
been
puck
fun
when
he
saw
men
in
the
early
days
working
so
hard
to
make
even
a
clay
cup
or
saucer
these
people
who
slept
and
ate
in
cave
knew
nothing
of
metals
or
how
to
make
iron
or
brass
tools
wire
or
machines
or
how
to
touch
a
button
and
light
up
a
whole
room
which
even
a
baby
can
now
do
there
is
one
thing
that
we
who
have
traveled
in
many
fairy
lands
have
often
noticed
and
told
our
friends
the
little
folks
and
that
is
this
all
the
fairies
we
ever
knew
are
very
slow
to
change
either
their
opinions
or
their
ways
or
their
fashions
like
many
mortals
they
think
a
great
deal
of
their
own
notions
they
imagine
that
the
only
way
to
do
a
thing
is
in
that
which
they
say
is
the
right
one
so
it
came
to
pass
that
even
when
the
cymric
folk
gave
up
wearing
the
skins
of
animals
and
put
on
pretty
clothes
woven
on
a
loom
and
ate
out
of
dishes
instead
of
clam
shells
there
were
still
some
fairies
that
kept
to
the
notions
and
fashions
of
the
cave
days
to
one
of
these
came
trouble
because
of
this
failing
now
there
was
once
a
pretty
nymph
who
lived
in
the
red
lake
to
which
a
young
and
handsome
farmer
used
to
come
to
catch
fish
one
misty
day
when
the
lad
could
see
only
a
few
feet
before
him
a
wind
cleared
the
air
and
blew
away
the
fog
then
he
saw
near
him
a
little
old
man
standing
on
a
ladder
he
was
hard
at
work
in
putting
a
thatched
roof
on
a
hut
which
he
had
built
a
few
minutes
later
as
the
mist
rose
and
the
breezes
blew
the
farmer
could
see
no
house
but
only
the
ripplings
of
water
on
the
surface
although
he
went
fishing
often
he
never
again
saw
anything
unusual
during
the
whole
summer
on
one
hot
day
in
the
early
autumn
while
he
stopped
to
let
his
horse
drink
he
looked
and
saw
a
very
lovely
face
on
the
water
wondering
to
whom
it
might
belong
there
rose
up
before
him
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
most
beautiful
woman
she
was
so
pretty
that
he
had
two
tumbles
he
fell
off
his
horse
and
he
fell
in
love
with
her
at
one
and
the
same
time
rushing
toward
the
lovely
vision
he
put
out
his
arms
at
that
spot
where
he
had
seen
her
but
only
to
embrace
empty
air
then
he
remembered
that
love
is
blind
so
he
rubbed
his
eyes
to
see
if
he
could
discern
anything
yet
though
he
peered
down
into
the
water
and
up
over
the
hills
he
could
not
see
her
anywhere
but
he
soon
found
out
to
his
joy
that
his
eyes
were
all
right
for
in
another
place
the
face
hair
and
her
reflection
in
the
water
came
again
then
his
desire
to
possess
the
damsel
was
doubled
but
again
she
disappeared
to
rise
again
somewhere
else
five
times
he
was
thus
tantalized
and
disappointed
she
rose
up
and
quickly
disappeared
it
seemed
as
though
she
meant
only
to
tease
him
so
he
rode
home
sorrowing
and
scarcely
slept
that
night
early
morning
found
the
lovelorn
youth
again
at
the
lake
side
but
for
hours
he
watched
in
vain
he
had
left
his
home
too
excited
to
have
eaten
his
usual
breakfast
which
greatly
surprised
his
housekeeper
now
he
pulled
out
some
sweet
apples
which
a
neighbor
had
given
him
and
began
to
munch
them
while
still
keeping
watch
on
the
waters
no
sooner
had
the
aroma
of
the
apples
fallen
on
the
air
than
the
pretty
lady
of
the
lake
bobbed
up
from
beneath
the
surface
and
this
time
quite
near
him
she
seemed
to
have
lost
all
fear
for
she
asked
him
to
throw
her
one
of
the
apples
please
come
pretty
maid
and
get
it
yourself
cried
the
farmer
then
he
held
up
the
red
apple
turning
it
round
and
round
before
her
to
tempt
her
by
showing
its
glossy
surface
and
rich
color
apparently
not
afraid
she
came
up
close
to
him
and
took
the
apple
from
his
left
hand
at
once
he
slipped
his
strong
right
arm
around
her
waist
and
hugged
her
tight
at
this
she
screamed
loudly
then
there
appeared
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
the
old
man
he
had
seen
thatching
the
roof
by
the
lake
shore
this
time
besides
his
long
snowy
beard
he
had
on
his
head
a
crown
of
water
lilies
mortal
said
the
venerable
person
that
is
my
daughter
you
are
clasping
what
do
you
wish
to
do
with
her
at
once
the
farmer
broke
out
in
passionate
appeal
to
the
old
man
that
she
might
become
his
wife
he
promised
to
love
her
always
treat
her
well
and
never
be
rough
or
cruel
to
her
the
old
father
listened
attentively
he
was
finally
convinced
that
the
farmer
would
make
a
good
husband
for
his
lovely
daughter
yet
he
was
very
sorry
to
lose
her
and
he
solemnly
laid
one
condition
upon
his
future
he
was
never
under
any
pretense
or
in
any
way
to
strike
her
with
clay
or
with
anything
made
or
baked
from
clay
any
blow
with
that
from
which
men
made
pots
and
pans
and
jars
and
dishes
or
in
fact
with
earth
of
any
sort
would
mean
the
instant
loss
of
his
wife
even
if
children
were
born
in
their
home
the
mother
would
leave
them
and
return
to
fairy
land
under
the
lake
and
be
forever
subject
to
the
law
of
the
fairies
as
before
her
marriage
the
farmer
was
very
much
in
love
with
his
pretty
prize
and
as
promises
are
easily
made
he
took
oath
that
no
clay
should
ever
touch
her
they
were
married
and
lived
very
happily
together
years
passed
and
the
man
was
still
a
good
husband
and
lover
he
kept
up
the
habit
which
he
had
learned
from
a
sailor
friend
every
night
when
far
from
home
and
out
on
the
sea
he
and
his
mates
used
to
drink
this
toast
sweethearts
and
wives
may
every
sweetheart
become
a
wife
and
every
wife
remain
a
sweetheart
and
every
husband
continue
a
lover
so
he
proved
that
though
a
husband
he
was
still
a
lover
by
always
doing
what
she
asked
him
and
more
when
the
children
were
born
and
grew
up
their
father
told
them
about
their
mother
likes
and
dislikes
her
tastes
and
her
wishes
and
warned
them
always
to
be
careful
so
it
was
altogether
a
very
happy
family
one
day
the
wife
and
mother
said
to
her
husband
that
she
had
a
great
longing
for
apples
she
would
like
to
taste
some
like
those
which
he
long
ago
gave
her
at
once
the
good
man
dropped
what
he
was
doing
and
hurried
off
to
his
neighbor
who
had
first
presented
him
with
a
trayful
of
these
apples
the
farmer
not
only
got
the
fruit
but
he
also
determined
that
he
would
plant
a
tree
and
thus
have
apples
for
his
wife
whenever
she
wanted
them
so
he
bought
a
fine
young
sapling
to
set
in
his
orchard
for
the
children
to
play
under
and
to
keep
his
pantry
full
of
the
fine
fruit
at
this
his
wife
was
delighted
so
happy
enough
in
fact
too
merry
to
think
of
anything
else
they
both
husband
and
wife
proceeded
to
set
the
sapling
in
the
ground
she
held
the
tree
while
he
dug
down
to
make
the
hole
deep
enough
to
make
sure
of
its
growing
but
farmers
are
sometimes
very
superstitious
they
even
believe
in
luck
though
not
in
puck
some
of
them
have
faith
in
what
the
almanac
and
the
patent
medicine
may
say
and
in
planting
potatoes
according
to
the
moon
but
they
scout
the
idea
of
there
being
any
fairies
with
the
farmer
this
had
become
a
fixed
state
of
mind
and
now
it
brought
him
to
grief
as
we
shall
see
for
though
he
remembered
what
his
wife
liked
and
disliked
and
recalled
what
her
father
had
told
him
he
had
forgotten
that
she
was
a
fairy
with
this
farmer
and
other
welsh
mortals
it
had
become
a
habit
when
planting
a
young
tree
to
throw
the
last
shovelful
of
earth
over
the
left
shoulder
this
was
for
good
luck
the
farmer
was
afraid
to
break
such
a
good
custom
as
he
thought
it
to
be
so
merrily
he
went
to
work
forgetting
everything
in
his
adherence
to
habit
he
became
so
absorbed
in
his
job
that
he
did
not
look
where
his
spadeful
went
and
it
struck
his
dear
wife
full
in
the
breast
at
that
moment
she
cried
out
bitterly
not
in
pain
but
in
sorrow
then
she
started
to
run
towards
the
lake
at
the
shore
she
called
out
dear
dear
husband
then
leaping
into
the
water
she
was
never
seen
again
and
all
his
tears
and
those
of
the
children
never
brought
her
back
ix
the
touch
of
iron
ages
ago
before
the
cymry
rowed
in
their
coracles
across
the
sea
there
was
a
race
of
men
already
in
the
land
of
honey
as
great
britain
was
then
called
these
ancient
people
who
lived
in
caves
did
not
know
how
to
build
houses
or
to
plow
the
ground
they
had
no
idea
that
they
could
get
their
food
out
of
the
earth
as
for
making
bread
and
pies
cookies
and
goodies
from
what
grew
from
the
soil
they
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
they
were
not
acquainted
with
the
use
of
fire
for
melting
copper
nor
did
they
know
how
to
get
iron
out
of
the
ore
to
make
knives
and
spears
arrow
heads
and
swords
and
armor
and
helmets
all
they
could
do
was
to
mold
clay
so
as
to
make
things
to
cook
with
and
hold
milk
or
water
when
they
baked
this
soft
stuff
in
the
fire
they
found
they
had
pots
pans
and
dishes
as
hard
as
stone
though
these
were
easily
broken
to
hunt
the
deer
or
fight
the
wolves
and
bears
they
fashioned
clubs
of
wood
for
javelins
and
arrows
they
took
hard
stone
like
flint
and
chipped
it
to
points
and
sharpened
it
with
edges
this
was
the
time
which
men
now
call
the
stone
age
when
the
men
went
to
war
their
weapons
were
wholly
of
wood
or
stone
they
had
not
yet
learned
to
weave
the
wool
of
the
sheep
into
warm
clothing
but
they
wore
the
skins
of
animals
each
one
of
the
caves
in
which
they
lived
was
a
general
boarding
house
for
dogs
and
pigs
as
well
as
people
when
a
young
man
of
one
tribe
wanted
a
wife
he
sallied
out
secretly
into
another
neighborhood
there
he
lay
in
wait
for
a
girl
to
come
along
he
then
ran
away
with
her
and
back
to
his
own
daddy
cave
by
and
by
when
the
cymry
came
into
the
land
they
had
iron
tools
and
better
weapons
of
war
then
there
were
many
and
long
battles
and
the
aborigines
were
beaten
many
times
so
the
cave
people
hated
everything
made
of
iron
anyone
of
the
cave
people
girls
or
boys
who
had
picked
up
iron
ornaments
and
were
found
wearing
or
using
iron
tools
or
buying
anything
of
iron
from
the
cave
people
enemies
was
looked
upon
as
a
rascal
or
a
villain
or
even
as
a
traitor
and
was
driven
out
of
the
tribe
however
some
of
the
daughters
of
the
cave
men
were
so
pretty
and
had
such
rosy
cheeks
and
lovely
bodies
and
beautiful
long
hair
that
quite
often
the
cymric
youth
fell
in
love
with
them
many
of
the
cave
men
daughters
were
captured
and
became
wives
of
the
cymry
and
mothers
of
children
in
course
of
ages
their
descendants
helped
to
make
the
bright
witty
welsh
people
now
the
fairies
usually
like
things
that
are
old
and
they
are
very
slow
to
alter
the
ancient
customs
to
which
they
have
been
used
for
in
the
fairy
world
there
is
no
measure
of
time
nor
any
clocks
watches
or
bells
to
strike
the
hours
and
no
almanacs
or
calendars
the
fairies
can
not
understand
why
ladies
change
the
fashions
so
often
and
the
men
their
ways
of
doing
things
they
wonder
why
beards
are
fashionable
at
one
time
then
moustaches
long
or
short
at
another
or
smooth
faces
when
razors
are
cheap
most
fairies
like
to
keep
on
doing
the
same
thing
in
the
old
way
they
enjoy
being
like
the
mountains
which
stand
or
the
sea
that
rolls
or
the
sun
that
rises
and
sets
every
day
and
forever
they
never
get
tired
of
repeating
what
they
did
yesterday
they
are
very
different
from
the
people
that
are
always
wanting
something
else
and
even
cry
if
they
can
not
have
it
that
is
the
reason
why
the
fairies
did
not
like
iron
or
to
see
men
wearing
iron
hats
and
clothes
called
helmets
and
armor
when
they
went
to
war
they
no
more
wanted
to
be
touched
by
iron
than
by
filth
or
foul
disease
they
hated
knives
stirrups
scythes
swords
pots
pans
kettles
or
this
metal
in
any
form
whether
sheet
barbed
wire
lump
or
pig
iron
now
there
was
a
long
pretty
stretch
of
water
near
which
lived
a
handsome
lad
who
loved
nothing
better
than
to
go
out
on
moonlight
nights
and
see
the
fairies
dance
or
listen
to
their
music
this
youth
fell
in
love
with
one
of
these
fairies
whose
beauty
was
great
beyond
description
at
last
unable
to
control
his
passion
he
rushed
into
the
midst
of
the
fairy
company
seized
the
beautiful
one
and
rushed
back
to
his
home
with
his
prize
in
his
arms
this
was
in
true
fashion
when
the
other
fairies
hurried
to
rescue
her
they
found
the
man
house
shut
they
dared
not
touch
the
door
for
it
was
covered
over
with
iron
studs
and
bands
and
bolted
with
the
metal
which
they
most
abhorred
the
young
man
immediately
began
to
make
love
to
the
fairy
maid
hoping
to
win
her
to
be
his
wife
for
a
long
time
she
refused
and
moped
all
day
and
night
while
weeping
many
salt
water
tears
she
declared
that
she
was
too
homesick
to
live
nevertheless
the
lover
persevered
finding
herself
locked
in
with
iron
bars
while
gratings
bolts
and
creaking
hinges
were
all
about
her
and
unable
to
return
to
her
people
the
fairy
first
thought
out
a
plan
of
possible
escape
then
she
agreed
to
become
the
man
wife
she
resolved
at
least
that
without
touching
it
she
should
oil
all
the
iron
work
and
stop
the
noise
she
was
a
smart
fairy
and
was
sure
she
could
outwit
the
man
even
if
he
were
so
strong
and
had
every
sort
of
iron
everywhere
in
order
to
keep
her
as
it
were
in
a
prison
so
pretending
she
loved
him
dearly
she
said
i
will
not
be
your
wife
but
if
you
can
find
out
my
name
i
shall
gladly
become
your
servant
easily
won
thought
the
lover
to
himself
yet
the
game
was
a
harder
one
to
play
than
he
supposed
it
was
like
playing
blind
man
buff
or
hunt
the
slipper
although
he
made
guesses
of
every
name
he
could
think
of
he
was
never
hot
and
got
no
nearer
to
the
thing
sought
than
if
his
eyes
were
bandaged
all
the
time
he
was
deeper
and
deeper
in
love
with
the
lovely
fairy
maid
but
one
night
on
returning
home
he
saw
in
a
turf
bog
a
group
of
fairies
sitting
on
a
log
at
once
he
thought
they
might
be
talking
about
their
lost
sister
so
he
crept
up
quite
near
them
and
soon
found
that
he
had
guessed
right
after
a
long
discussion
finding
themselves
still
at
a
loss
as
to
how
to
recover
her
he
heard
one
of
them
sigh
and
say
oh
siwsi
my
sister
how
can
you
live
with
a
mortal
enough
said
the
young
man
to
himself
i
got
it
then
crawling
away
noiselessly
he
ran
back
all
the
way
to
his
house
and
unlocked
the
door
once
inside
the
room
he
called
out
his
name
siwsi
siwsi
astonished
at
hearing
her
name
she
cried
out
what
mortal
has
betrayed
me
for
surely
no
fairy
would
tell
on
me
alas
my
fate
my
fate
but
in
her
own
mind
the
struggle
and
the
fear
were
over
she
had
bravely
striven
to
keep
her
fairyhood
and
in
the
battle
of
wits
had
lost
she
would
not
be
wife
but
what
a
wise
superb
and
faithful
servant
she
made
everything
prospered
under
her
hand
the
house
and
the
farm
became
models
not
twice
but
three
times
a
day
the
cows
milked
by
her
yielded
milk
unusually
rich
in
cream
in
the
market
her
butter
excelled
in
quality
and
price
all
others
meanwhile
the
passion
of
the
lover
abated
not
one
jot
or
for
an
instant
his
perseverance
finally
won
she
agreed
to
become
his
wife
but
only
on
one
condition
you
must
never
strike
me
with
iron
she
said
if
you
do
i
feel
free
to
leave
you
and
go
back
to
my
relatives
in
the
fairy
family
a
hearty
laugh
from
the
happy
lover
greeted
this
remark
made
by
the
lovely
creature
once
his
servant
but
now
his
betrothed
he
thought
that
the
condition
was
very
easy
to
obey
so
they
were
married
and
no
couple
in
all
the
land
seemed
to
be
happier
once
twice
the
cradle
was
filled
it
rocked
with
new
treasures
that
had
life
and
were
more
dear
than
farm
or
home
or
wealth
in
barns
or
cattle
cheese
and
butter
a
boy
and
a
girl
were
theirs
then
the
mother
care
was
unremitting
day
and
night
even
though
the
happy
father
grew
richer
every
year
and
bought
farm
after
farm
until
he
owned
five
thousand
acres
he
valued
more
than
these
possessions
his
lovely
wife
and
his
beautiful
children
yet
this
very
delight
and
affection
made
him
less
vigilant
yes
even
less
careful
concerning
the
promise
he
had
once
given
to
his
fairy
wife
who
still
held
to
the
ancient
ideas
of
the
fairy
family
in
regard
to
iron
one
of
his
finest
mares
had
given
birth
to
a
filly
which
when
the
day
of
the
great
fair
came
he
determined
to
sell
at
a
high
price
so
with
a
halter
on
his
arm
he
went
out
to
catch
her
but
she
was
a
lively
creature
so
frisky
that
it
was
much
like
his
first
attempt
to
win
his
fairy
bride
it
almost
looked
as
if
she
were
a
cave
girl
running
away
from
a
lover
who
had
a
lasso
in
his
hand
the
lively
and
frolicsome
beast
scampered
here
and
there
grazing
as
she
stopped
as
if
she
were
determined
to
put
off
her
capture
as
long
as
possible
so
calling
to
his
wife
the
two
of
them
together
tried
their
skill
to
catch
the
filly
this
time
leaving
the
halter
in
the
house
the
man
took
bit
and
bridle
and
the
two
managed
to
get
the
pretty
creature
into
a
corner
but
when
they
had
almost
captured
her
away
she
dashed
again
by
this
time
the
man
was
so
vexed
that
he
lost
his
temper
and
he
who
does
that
usually
loses
the
game
while
he
who
controls
the
wrath
within
wins
mad
as
a
flaming
fire
he
lost
his
brains
also
and
threw
bit
and
bridle
and
the
whole
harness
after
the
fleet
animal
alas
alas
the
wife
had
started
to
run
after
the
filly
and
the
iron
bit
struck
her
on
the
cheek
it
did
not
hurt
but
he
had
broken
his
vow
now
came
the
surprise
of
his
life
it
was
as
if
at
one
moment
a
flash
of
lightning
had
made
all
things
bright
and
then
in
another
second
was
inky
darkness
he
saw
this
lovely
wife
one
moment
active
and
fleet
as
a
deer
in
another
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
nothing
was
there
she
had
vanished
after
this
there
was
a
lonely
home
empty
of
its
light
and
cheer
but
by
living
with
human
beings
a
new
idea
and
form
of
life
had
transformed
this
fairy
and
a
new
spell
was
laid
on
her
had
been
awakened
in
her
heart
henceforth
though
the
law
of
the
fairy
world
would
not
allow
her
to
touch
again
the
realm
of
earth
she
having
once
been
wife
and
parent
could
not
forget
the
babies
born
of
her
body
so
making
a
sod
raft
a
floating
island
she
came
up
at
night
and
often
while
these
three
mortals
lived
this
fairy
mother
would
spend
hours
tenderly
talking
to
her
husband
and
her
two
children
who
were
now
big
boy
and
girl
as
they
stood
on
the
lake
shore
on
his
part
the
father
did
not
think
it
an
ideal
arrangement
as
some
modern
married
folks
do
to
be
thus
separated
wife
and
husband
one
from
the
other
but
by
her
coming
as
near
as
could
be
allowed
she
showed
her
undying
love
even
good
people
sometimes
see
a
little
island
floating
on
the
lake
and
this
they
point
out
as
the
place
where
the
fairy
mother
was
wont
to
come
and
hold
converse
with
her
dear
ones
when
they
merrily
eat
the
pink
delicacy
called
floating
island
moving
it
about
with
a
spoon
on
its
yellow
lake
of
eggs
and
cream
they
call
this
the
fairy
mother
rocking
chair
x
the
maiden
of
the
green
forest
many
a
palace
lies
under
the
waves
that
wash
cymric
land
for
the
sea
has
swallowed
up
more
than
one
village
and
even
cities
when
welsh
fairies
yield
to
their
mortal
lovers
and
consent
to
become
their
wives
it
is
always
on
some
condition
or
promise
sometimes
there
are
several
of
these
which
the
fairy
ladies
compel
their
mortal
lovers
to
pledge
them
before
they
agree
to
become
wives
in
fact
the
fairies
in
cymric
land
are
among
the
most
exacting
of
any
known
a
prince
named
benlli
of
the
powys
region
found
this
out
to
his
grief
for
he
had
always
supposed
that
wives
could
be
had
simply
for
the
asking
all
that
a
man
need
say
to
the
girl
to
whom
he
took
a
fancy
was
this
come
along
with
me
and
be
my
bride
and
then
she
would
say
thank
you
i
come
and
the
two
would
trot
off
together
this
was
the
man
notion
now
benlli
was
a
wicked
old
fellow
he
was
already
married
but
wrinkles
had
gathered
on
his
wife
face
she
had
a
faded
look
and
her
hair
was
thinning
out
she
would
never
be
young
again
and
he
was
tired
of
her
and
wanted
a
mate
with
fresh
rosy
cheeks
and
long
thick
hair
he
was
quite
ready
to
fall
in
love
with
such
a
maiden
whenever
his
eyes
should
light
upon
her
one
day
he
went
out
hunting
in
the
green
forest
while
waiting
for
a
wild
boar
to
rush
out
there
rode
past
him
a
young
woman
whose
beauty
was
dazzling
he
instantly
fell
in
love
with
her
the
next
day
while
on
horseback
at
the
same
opening
in
the
forest
the
same
maiden
reappeared
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
and
then
she
vanished
again
on
the
third
day
the
prince
rode
out
to
the
appointed
place
and
again
the
vision
of
beauty
was
there
he
rode
up
to
her
and
begged
her
to
come
and
live
with
him
at
his
palace
i
will
come
and
be
your
wedded
wife
on
three
conditions
you
must
put
away
the
wife
you
now
have
you
must
permit
me
to
leave
you
one
night
in
every
seven
without
following
after
or
spying
upon
me
and
you
must
not
ask
me
where
i
go
or
what
i
do
swear
to
me
that
you
will
do
these
three
things
then
if
you
keep
your
promises
unbroken
my
beauty
shall
never
change
no
not
until
the
tall
vegetable
wave
and
the
long
green
rushes
grow
in
your
hall
the
prince
of
powys
was
quite
ready
to
swear
this
oath
and
he
solemnly
promised
to
observe
the
three
conditions
so
the
maid
of
the
green
forest
went
to
live
with
him
but
what
of
his
old
wife
one
asks
ah
he
had
no
trouble
from
that
quarter
for
when
the
couple
arrived
at
the
castle
she
had
already
disappeared
happy
indeed
were
the
long
bright
days
which
the
prince
and
his
new
bride
spent
together
whether
in
the
castle
or
out
doors
riding
on
horseback
or
in
hunting
the
deer
every
day
her
beauty
seemed
diviner
and
she
more
lovely
he
lavished
various
gifts
upon
her
among
others
that
of
a
diadem
of
beryl
and
sapphire
then
he
put
on
her
finger
a
diamond
ring
worth
what
was
a
very
great
sum
a
ransom
in
the
middle
ages
monarchs
as
well
as
nobles
were
taken
prisoners
in
battle
and
large
amounts
of
money
had
to
be
paid
to
get
them
back
again
so
a
king
ransom
is
what
benlli
paid
for
his
diamond
ring
he
loved
her
so
dearly
that
he
never
suspected
for
a
moment
that
he
would
ever
have
any
trouble
in
keeping
his
three
promises
but
without
variety
life
has
no
spice
and
monotony
wearies
the
soul
after
nine
years
had
passed
and
his
wife
absented
herself
every
friday
night
he
began
to
wonder
why
it
could
be
his
curiosity
to
know
the
reason
for
her
going
away
so
increased
that
it
so
wore
on
him
that
he
became
both
miserable
in
himself
and
irritable
toward
others
everybody
in
the
castle
noticed
the
change
in
their
master
and
grieved
over
it
one
night
he
invited
a
learned
monk
from
the
white
monastery
not
far
away
to
come
and
take
dinner
with
him
the
table
in
the
great
banqueting
hall
was
spread
with
the
most
delicious
viands
the
lights
were
magnificent
and
the
music
gay
but
wyland
the
monk
was
a
man
of
magic
and
could
see
through
things
he
noticed
that
some
secret
grief
was
preying
upon
the
prince
mind
he
discerned
that
amidst
all
this
splendor
he
benlli
the
lord
of
the
castle
was
the
most
miserable
person
within
its
walls
so
wyland
went
home
resolved
to
call
again
and
find
out
what
was
the
trouble
when
they
met
some
days
later
wyland
greeting
was
this
christ
save
thee
benlli
what
secret
sorrow
clouds
thy
brow
why
so
gloomy
benlli
at
once
burst
out
with
the
story
of
how
he
met
the
maid
of
the
green
forest
and
how
she
became
his
wife
on
three
conditions
think
of
it
said
benlli
groaning
aloud
when
the
owls
cry
and
the
crickets
chirp
my
wife
leaves
my
bed
and
until
the
daystar
appears
i
lie
alone
torn
with
curiosity
to
know
where
she
is
and
what
she
is
doing
i
fall
again
into
heavy
sleep
and
do
not
awake
until
sunrise
when
i
find
her
by
my
side
again
it
is
all
such
a
mystery
that
the
secret
lies
heavy
on
my
soul
despite
all
my
wealth
and
my
strong
castle
with
feasting
and
music
by
night
and
hunting
by
day
i
am
the
most
miserable
man
in
cymric
land
no
beggar
is
more
wretched
than
i
wyland
the
monk
listened
and
his
eyes
glittered
there
came
into
his
head
the
idea
of
enriching
the
monastery
he
saw
his
chance
and
improved
it
at
once
he
could
make
money
by
solving
the
secret
for
a
troubled
soul
prince
benlli
said
he
if
you
will
bestow
upon
the
monks
of
the
white
minster
one
tenth
of
all
the
flocks
that
feed
within
your
domain
and
one
tenth
of
all
that
flows
into
the
vaults
of
your
palace
and
hand
over
the
maiden
of
the
green
forest
to
me
i
shall
warrant
that
your
soul
will
be
at
peace
and
your
troubles
end
to
all
this
prince
benlli
agreed
making
solemn
promise
then
the
monk
wyland
took
his
book
leather
bound
and
kept
shut
by
means
of
metal
clasps
and
hid
himself
in
the
cranny
of
a
rock
near
the
cave
from
which
there
was
entrance
down
into
fairyland
he
had
not
long
to
wait
for
soon
with
a
crown
on
her
head
a
lady
royally
arrayed
passed
by
out
of
the
silvery
moonlight
into
the
dark
cave
it
was
none
other
than
the
maiden
of
the
green
forest
now
came
a
battle
of
magic
and
spells
as
between
the
monk
own
and
those
of
the
green
forest
maiden
he
moved
forward
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
then
summoning
into
his
presence
the
spirits
of
the
air
and
the
cave
he
informed
them
as
to
benlli
vow
to
enrich
the
monastery
and
to
deliver
the
green
forest
maiden
to
himself
then
calling
aloud
he
said
let
her
forever
be
as
she
now
appears
and
never
leave
my
side
bring
her
before
the
break
of
day
to
the
cross
near
the
town
of
the
white
minster
and
there
will
i
wed
her
and
swear
to
make
her
my
own
then
by
the
power
of
his
magic
he
made
it
impossible
for
any
person
or
power
to
recall
or
hinder
the
operation
of
these
words
leaving
the
cave
mouth
in
order
to
be
at
the
cross
before
day
should
dawn
the
first
thing
he
met
was
a
hideous
ogress
grinning
and
rolling
her
bleared
red
eyes
at
him
on
her
head
seemed
what
was
more
like
moss
than
hair
she
stretched
out
a
long
bony
finger
at
him
on
it
flashed
the
splendid
diamond
which
benlli
had
given
his
bride
the
beautiful
maid
of
the
green
forest
take
me
to
thy
bosom
monk
wyland
she
shrieked
laughing
hideously
and
showing
what
looked
like
green
snags
in
her
mouth
for
i
am
the
wife
you
are
sworn
to
thirty
years
ago
i
was
benlli
blooming
bride
when
my
beauty
left
me
his
love
flew
out
of
the
window
now
i
am
a
foul
ogress
but
magic
makes
me
young
again
every
seventh
night
i
promised
that
my
beauty
should
last
until
the
tall
flag
reeds
and
the
long
green
rushes
grow
in
his
hall
amazed
at
her
story
wyland
drew
in
his
breath
and
this
promise
i
have
kept
it
is
already
fulfilled
your
spell
and
mine
are
both
completed
yours
brought
to
him
the
peace
of
the
dead
mine
made
the
river
floods
rush
in
now
waters
lap
to
and
fro
among
the
reeds
and
rushes
that
grow
in
the
banqueting
hall
which
is
now
sunk
deep
below
the
earth
with
the
clash
of
our
spells
no
charm
can
redress
our
fate
come
then
and
take
me
as
thy
bride
for
oath
and
spell
have
both
decreed
it
as
thy
reward
as
benlli
promise
to
you
is
fulfilled
for
the
waters
flow
in
the
palace
vaults
the
pike
and
the
dare
fish
feed
there
so
caught
in
his
own
dark
sordid
plot
the
monk
who
played
conjurer
had
become
the
victim
of
his
own
craft
they
say
that
wyland
cross
still
recalls
the
monk
while
fishermen
on
the
welsh
border
can
on
nights
with
smooth
water
see
towers
and
chimneys
far
below
sunk
deep
beneath
the
waves
xi
the
treasure
stone
of
the
fairies
the
gruffyds
were
one
of
the
largest
of
the
welsh
tribes
it
is
said
that
in
britain
one
man
in
every
forty
has
this
as
either
his
first
middle
or
last
name
it
means
hero
or
brave
man
and
as
far
back
as
the
ninth
century
the
word
is
found
in
the
book
of
saint
chad
the
monks
who
derived
nearly
every
name
from
the
latin
insisted
the
word
meant
great
faith
another
of
the
most
common
of
welsh
personal
names
was
william
which
when
that
of
a
father
son
was
written
williams
and
was
only
the
latin
for
gild
helm
or
golden
helmet
long
ago
when
london
was
a
village
and
cardiff
only
a
hamlet
there
was
a
boy
of
this
name
who
tended
sheep
on
the
hill
sides
his
father
was
a
hard
working
farmer
who
every
year
tried
to
coax
to
grow
out
of
the
stony
ground
some
oats
barley
leeks
and
cabbage
in
summer
he
worked
hard
from
the
first
croak
of
the
raven
to
the
last
hoot
of
the
owl
to
provide
food
for
his
wife
and
baby
daughter
when
his
boy
was
born
he
took
him
to
the
church
to
be
christened
gruffyd
but
every
body
called
him
gruff
in
time
several
little
sisters
came
to
keep
the
boy
company
his
mother
always
kept
her
cottage
which
was
painted
pink
very
neat
and
pretty
with
vines
covering
the
outside
while
flowers
bloomed
indoors
these
were
set
in
pots
and
on
shelves
near
the
latticed
windows
they
seemed
to
grow
finely
because
so
good
a
woman
loved
them
the
copper
was
kept
bright
and
the
broad
borders
on
the
clay
floor
along
the
walls
were
always
fresh
with
whitewash
the
pewter
dishes
on
the
sideboard
shone
as
if
they
were
moons
and
the
china
cats
on
the
mantle
piece
in
silvery
luster
reflected
both
sun
and
candle
light
daddy
often
declared
he
could
use
these
polished
metal
plates
for
a
mirror
when
he
shaved
his
face
puss
the
pet
was
always
happy
purring
away
on
the
hearth
as
the
kettle
boiled
to
make
the
flummery
of
sour
oat
jelly
which
daddy
loved
so
well
mother
gruffyd
was
always
so
neat
with
her
black
and
white
striped
apron
her
high
peaked
hat
with
its
scalloped
lace
and
quilled
fastening
around
her
chin
her
little
short
shawl
with
its
pointed
long
tips
tied
in
a
bow
and
her
bright
red
plaid
petticoat
folded
back
from
her
frock
her
rolling
collar
and
neck
cloth
knotted
at
the
top
and
fringed
at
the
ends
added
fine
touches
to
her
picturesque
costume
in
fact
young
gruffyd
was
proud
of
his
mother
and
he
loved
her
dearly
he
thought
no
woman
could
be
quite
as
sweet
as
she
was
once
at
the
end
of
the
day
on
coming
back
home
from
the
hills
the
boy
met
some
lovely
children
they
were
dressed
in
very
fine
clothes
and
had
elegant
manners
they
came
up
smiled
and
invited
him
to
play
with
them
he
joined
in
their
sports
and
was
too
much
interested
to
take
note
of
time
he
kept
on
playing
with
them
until
it
was
pitch
dark
among
other
games
which
he
enjoyed
had
been
that
of
the
king
in
his
counting
house
counting
out
his
money
and
the
queen
in
her
kitchen
eating
bread
and
honey
and
the
girl
hanging
out
the
clothes
and
the
saucy
blackbird
that
snipped
off
her
nose
in
playing
these
the
children
had
aprons
full
of
what
seemed
to
be
real
coins
the
size
of
crowns
or
pieces
each
worth
a
dollar
these
had
head
and
tail
beside
letters
on
them
and
the
boy
supposed
they
were
real
but
when
he
showed
these
to
his
mother
she
saw
at
once
from
their
lightness
and
because
they
were
so
easily
bent
that
they
were
only
paper
and
not
silver
she
asked
her
boy
where
he
had
got
them
he
told
her
what
a
nice
time
he
had
enjoyed
then
she
knew
that
these
his
playmates
were
fairy
children
fearing
that
some
evil
might
come
of
this
she
charged
him
her
only
son
never
to
go
out
again
alone
on
the
mountain
she
mistrusted
that
no
good
would
come
of
making
such
strange
children
his
companions
but
the
lad
was
so
fond
of
play
that
one
day
tired
of
seeing
nothing
but
byre
and
garden
while
his
sisters
liked
to
play
girls
games
more
than
those
which
boys
cared
most
for
and
the
hills
seeming
to
beckon
him
to
come
to
them
he
disobeyed
and
slipped
out
and
off
to
the
mountains
he
was
soon
missed
and
search
was
made
for
him
yet
nobody
had
seen
or
heard
of
him
though
inquiries
were
made
on
every
road
in
every
village
and
at
all
the
fairs
and
markets
in
the
neighborhood
two
whole
years
passed
by
without
a
trace
of
the
boy
but
early
one
morning
of
the
month
before
breakfast
his
mother
on
opening
the
door
found
him
sitting
on
the
steps
with
a
bundle
under
his
arm
but
dressed
in
the
same
clothes
and
not
looking
a
day
older
or
in
any
way
different
from
the
very
hour
he
disappeared
why
my
dear
boy
where
have
you
been
all
these
months
which
have
now
run
into
the
third
year
so
long
a
time
that
they
have
seemed
to
me
like
ages
why
mother
dear
how
strange
you
talk
i
left
here
yesterday
to
go
out
and
to
play
with
the
children
on
the
hills
and
we
have
had
a
lovely
time
see
what
pretty
clothes
they
have
given
me
for
a
present
then
he
opened
his
bundle
but
when
she
tore
open
the
package
the
mother
was
all
the
more
sure
that
she
was
right
and
that
her
fears
had
been
justified
in
it
she
found
only
a
dress
of
white
paper
examining
it
carefully
she
could
see
neither
seam
nor
stitches
she
threw
it
in
the
fire
and
again
warned
her
son
against
fairy
children
but
pretty
soon
after
a
great
calamity
had
come
upon
them
both
father
and
mother
changed
their
minds
about
fairies
they
had
put
all
their
savings
into
the
venture
of
a
ship
which
had
for
a
long
time
made
trading
voyages
from
cardiff
every
year
it
came
back
bringing
great
profit
to
the
owners
and
shareholders
in
this
way
daddy
was
able
to
eke
out
his
income
and
keep
himself
his
wife
and
daughters
comfortably
clothed
while
all
the
time
the
table
was
well
supplied
with
good
food
nor
did
they
ever
turn
from
their
door
anyone
who
asked
for
bread
and
cheese
but
in
the
same
month
of
the
boy
return
bad
news
came
that
the
good
ship
had
gone
down
in
a
storm
all
on
board
had
perished
and
the
cargo
was
totally
lost
in
the
deep
sea
far
from
land
in
fact
no
word
except
that
of
dire
disaster
had
come
to
hand
now
it
was
a
tradition
as
old
as
the
days
of
king
arthur
that
on
a
certain
hill
a
great
boulder
could
be
seen
which
was
quite
different
from
any
other
kind
of
rock
to
be
found
within
miles
it
was
partly
imbedded
in
the
earth
and
beneath
it
lay
a
great
yes
an
untold
treasure
the
grass
grew
luxuriantly
around
this
stone
and
the
sheep
loved
to
rest
at
noon
in
its
shadow
many
men
had
tried
to
lift
or
pry
it
up
but
in
vain
the
tradition
unaltered
and
unbroken
for
centuries
was
to
the
effect
that
none
but
a
very
good
man
could
ever
budge
this
stone
any
and
all
unworthy
men
might
dig
or
pull
or
pry
until
doomsday
but
in
vain
till
the
right
one
came
the
treasure
was
as
safe
as
if
in
heaven
but
the
boy
father
and
mother
were
now
very
poor
and
his
sisters
now
grown
up
wanted
pretty
clothes
so
badly
that
the
lad
hoped
that
he
or
his
father
might
be
the
deserving
one
he
would
help
him
to
win
the
treasure
for
he
felt
sure
that
his
parent
would
share
his
gains
with
all
his
friends
though
his
neighbors
were
not
told
of
the
generous
intentions
credited
to
the
boy
father
by
his
loving
son
they
all
came
with
horses
ropes
crowbars
and
tackle
to
help
in
the
enterprise
yet
after
many
a
long
days
toil
between
the
sun
rising
and
setting
their
end
was
failure
every
day
when
darkness
came
on
the
stone
lay
there
still
as
hard
and
fast
as
ever
so
they
gave
up
the
task
on
the
final
night
the
lad
saw
that
father
and
mother
who
were
great
lovers
were
holding
each
other
hands
while
their
tears
flowed
together
and
they
were
praying
for
patience
seeing
this
before
he
fell
asleep
the
boy
resolved
that
on
the
morrow
he
would
go
up
to
the
mountains
and
talk
to
his
fairy
friends
about
the
matter
so
early
in
the
morning
he
hurried
to
the
hill
tops
and
going
into
one
of
the
caves
met
the
fairies
and
told
them
his
troubles
then
he
asked
them
to
give
him
again
some
of
their
money
not
this
time
but
something
better
under
the
great
rock
there
are
treasures
waiting
for
you
oh
do
send
me
there
for
all
the
men
and
horses
of
our
parish
after
working
a
week
have
been
unable
to
budge
the
stone
we
know
that
answered
the
principal
fairy
but
do
you
yourself
try
to
move
it
then
you
will
see
what
is
certain
to
happen
going
home
to
tell
what
he
had
heard
his
parents
had
a
hearty
laugh
at
the
idea
of
a
boy
succeeding
where
men
with
the
united
strength
of
many
horses
and
oxen
had
failed
yet
after
brooding
awhile
they
were
so
dejected
that
anything
seemed
reasonable
so
they
said
go
ahead
and
try
it
returning
to
the
mountain
the
fairies
in
a
band
went
with
him
to
the
great
rock
one
touch
of
his
hand
and
the
mighty
boulder
trembled
like
an
aspen
leaf
in
the
breeze
a
shove
and
the
rock
rolled
down
from
the
hill
and
crashed
in
the
valley
below
there
underneath
were
little
heaps
of
gold
and
silver
which
the
boy
carried
home
to
his
parents
who
became
the
richest
people
in
the
country
round
about
xii
giant
tom
and
giant
blubb
everyone
who
has
read
anything
of
welsh
history
though
not
of
the
sort
that
is
written
by
english
folks
knows
also
that
cornwall
is
in
soul
a
part
of
wales
before
the
romans
first
and
the
saxons
next
invaded
britain
the
cymric
people
lived
all
over
the
island
south
of
scotland
they
were
the
british
people
and
nobody
ever
heard
the
german
name
wales
which
means
a
foreign
land
or
the
word
welsh
which
refers
to
foreigners
until
men
who
were
themselves
outsiders
came
into
britain
since
that
time
it
has
been
much
the
same
as
when
a
british
jack
tar
when
rambling
in
portugal
or
china
calls
the
natives
foreigners
and
tells
them
to
get
out
of
the
way
ages
ago
when
the
cymric
men
with
their
wives
and
little
ones
rowed
over
in
their
coracles
from
gallia
or
the
summer
land
to
britain
the
honey
land
they
came
first
to
the
promontory
which
we
know
as
cornwall
that
is
the
cornu
galliae
or
walliae
which
means
horn
or
cape
of
the
new
country
now
called
england
here
was
a
new
region
rich
in
every
kind
of
minerals
ages
before
the
phoenicians
had
named
it
britain
or
the
land
of
tin
within
the
memory
of
men
now
living
cornishmen
that
is
the
miners
of
cornwall
on
going
to
california
discovered
gold
in
cornwall
as
part
of
the
cymric
realm
king
arthur
found
and
married
guinevere
his
queen
it
was
in
cornwall
also
that
merlin
was
hidden
hear
the
rhyme
marvelous
merlin
is
wasted
away
by
a
wicked
woman
who
may
she
be
for
she
hath
pent
him
in
a
crag
on
cornwall
coast
so
it
happens
that
thousands
of
english
people
in
cornwall
are
welsh
by
both
name
or
descent
or
have
translated
their
names
into
english
form
even
while
keeping
the
welsh
meaning
they
are
also
welsh
in
traits
of
character
just
as
tens
of
thousands
of
welsh
folks
among
the
first
settlers
of
new
england
and
the
american
colonies
are
described
in
our
histories
as
english
people
now
in
early
cornwall
there
were
many
giants
some
were
good
but
others
were
bad
one
of
these
a
right
fine
fellow
was
named
tom
and
the
other
a
bad
one
blubb
this
giant
had
had
twenty
wives
and
was
awfully
cruel
nobody
ever
knew
what
became
of
the
twenty
maidens
he
had
married
sometimes
people
called
the
big
fellow
that
lived
in
a
castle
giant
blunderbuss
but
blubb
was
his
name
for
short
he
was
much
taller
than
the
highest
hop
pole
in
kent
he
was
made
up
mostly
of
head
and
stomach
for
his
chief
idea
in
living
was
to
eat
his
skull
was
as
big
as
a
hogshead
or
a
or
a
market
wagon
loaded
with
carrots
indeed
it
was
strongly
suspected
by
most
people
that
the
big
bone
box
set
on
his
shoulders
was
as
hollow
inside
as
a
pumpkin
but
that
a
cocoanut
would
hold
all
the
brains
he
had
at
any
rate
during
one
of
his
fights
with
another
giant
he
had
been
given
an
awful
thwack
from
the
other
giant
club
then
the
sound
made
which
was
heard
a
long
distance
away
was
exactly
like
that
when
one
pounds
on
an
empty
barrel
now
this
giant
blubb
had
built
a
mighty
castle
between
a
big
hill
and
a
river
under
it
were
vaults
of
vast
size
filled
with
treasures
of
all
sorts
gold
silver
jewels
and
gems
there
were
cells
in
which
he
kept
his
wives
after
he
had
married
them
it
was
the
opinion
of
his
neighbors
that
in
every
case
soon
after
the
honeymoon
was
over
he
ate
them
up
yet
if
even
the
devil
ought
to
have
his
due
one
should
be
fair
to
this
human
monster
and
we
are
bound
to
say
that
giant
blubb
denied
these
stories
as
pure
gossip
it
is
certain
that
such
crimes
as
murder
and
cannibalism
never
could
be
proved
against
him
to
guard
his
underground
treasures
he
had
two
huge
and
fierce
dogs
supposed
to
be
named
catchem
and
tearem
what
they
were
really
called
by
their
master
was
a
secret
yet
anyone
who
had
a
piece
of
meat
ready
to
throw
to
them
and
knew
their
names
which
were
pass
words
could
first
quiet
them
then
he
could
walk
by
them
and
get
the
treasure
besides
these
dogs
the
only
living
thing
left
in
the
castle
when
the
giant
went
out
was
the
latest
blubb
yet
she
was
in
constant
fear
of
her
life
lest
her
big
husband
should
sometime
make
a
meal
of
her
for
even
she
had
heard
the
story
that
blubb
was
a
cannibal
and
looked
at
all
plump
women
simply
as
delicacies
exactly
as
a
boy
peers
into
the
window
of
a
candy
shop
what
made
all
the
country
round
hate
this
cruel
giant
was
not
wholly
on
account
of
his
awful
appetite
it
was
because
he
had
ruined
the
king
high
road
ever
since
the
time
of
king
lud
whose
name
we
read
in
ludgate
hill
in
london
where
his
cymric
majesty
had
lived
this
highway
had
been
free
to
all
it
ran
all
the
way
through
cornwall
from
penzance
and
thence
eastward
to
london
and
beyond
when
giant
blubb
wished
to
enlarge
his
castle
he
had
the
walls
and
towers
built
down
to
the
river
edge
this
closed
up
the
big
road
so
that
people
had
to
go
far
around
and
up
over
the
hill
or
by
boat
along
the
river
such
a
roundabout
way
took
much
time
and
toil
and
was
too
much
trouble
for
all
everybody
had
to
submit
to
this
extortion
until
there
came
along
giant
tom
of
whom
we
shall
now
tell
his
real
name
was
rolling
stone
for
he
never
stuck
long
in
one
place
at
a
job
and
cared
not
a
cucumber
for
money
or
fine
clothes
this
jolly
fellow
was
very
and
popular
but
often
very
lazy
his
mother
talked
with
him
many
times
urging
him
to
learn
a
trade
or
in
some
way
make
an
honest
living
she
found
it
very
hard
to
keep
anything
in
her
larder
barn
pantry
or
cellar
when
he
was
at
home
he
measured
four
feet
across
his
shoulders
and
at
every
meal
he
ate
what
would
feed
three
big
men
but
as
he
could
do
six
men
work
when
he
had
a
mind
to
as
often
he
did
he
was
always
welcome
in
fact
he
was
too
popular
for
his
own
good
one
day
when
ten
common
fellows
were
trying
their
utmost
to
lift
a
big
long
log
on
a
cart
and
were
unable
to
do
it
tom
came
along
and
told
them
to
stand
back
then
he
hoisted
the
tree
on
to
the
wain
roped
it
into
place
and
told
the
cartman
to
drive
on
then
they
all
cheered
him
and
one
of
them
lifted
his
monmouth
cap
and
cried
out
hurrah
for
giant
tom
he
the
fellow
to
whip
giant
blubb
he
is
he
is
they
all
cried
in
chorus
who
is
this
giant
blubb
where
does
he
live
asked
tom
rolling
up
his
sleeves
for
he
was
just
spoiling
for
a
row
with
a
fellow
of
his
size
then
they
told
the
story
of
how
the
big
bully
had
ruined
the
highway
by
building
a
great
wall
and
tower
across
the
road
to
shut
it
up
to
the
grief
of
many
honest
men
never
mind
boys
i
attend
to
his
bacon
said
tom
leave
the
matter
with
me
and
do
bother
to
tell
the
king
about
it
tom
went
the
next
day
into
town
and
hired
himself
out
to
a
beer
brewer
to
drive
the
wagon
perhaps
he
hoped
also
while
in
this
occupation
to
keep
down
his
thirst
he
asked
the
boss
to
give
him
the
route
that
led
past
giant
castle
over
the
old
king
highway
the
master
of
the
brewery
saw
through
tom
purpose
he
winked
and
only
said
go
ahead
my
boy
i
pay
you
double
wages
if
you
will
open
that
road
again
but
see
that
giant
blubb
does
not
get
my
load
of
kegs
or
that
your
carcass
does
count
with
those
of
the
twenty
wives
in
his
vaults
and
make
again
he
winked
his
eye
knowingly
to
his
workmen
tom
drove
off
he
occupied
all
the
room
on
the
seat
of
the
cart
which
two
men
usually
filled
and
left
plenty
of
room
on
either
side
cracking
his
whip
the
new
driver
kept
the
four
horses
on
a
galloping
pace
until
very
soon
he
called
out
whoa
before
the
frowning
high
gateway
of
giant
blubb
tom
shouted
from
the
depth
of
his
lungs
open
the
gate
and
let
me
drive
through
this
is
the
king
highway
the
only
reply
for
a
minute
was
the
barking
of
the
curs
then
a
rattling
of
bolts
was
heard
and
the
great
gates
swung
wide
open
who
are
you
you
impudent
fellow
go
round
over
the
hill
or
thrash
you
blustered
giant
blubb
in
a
rage
better
save
your
breath
to
cool
your
porridge
you
big
boaster
and
come
out
and
fight
said
tom
fight
you
pigmy
i
just
get
a
switch
and
whip
you
as
i
would
a
bad
boy
thereupon
giant
blubb
stepped
aside
into
the
grove
nearby
keeping
all
the
while
an
eye
on
his
gate
guarded
by
his
two
monstrous
dogs
he
selected
an
elm
tree
twenty
feet
high
tore
it
up
by
the
roots
pulled
off
the
branches
and
peeled
it
for
a
whip
this
he
jerked
up
and
down
to
make
ready
for
his
task
of
thrashing
the
pigmy
meanwhile
giant
tom
upset
the
wain
drew
out
the
tongue
and
took
off
one
of
the
wheels
then
as
if
armed
with
spear
and
shield
he
advanced
to
meet
giant
blubb
he
whistled
like
a
boy
as
he
went
forward
in
a
passion
of
rage
giant
blubb
lifted
his
elm
switch
to
strike
but
tom
warded
off
the
blow
with
his
wheel
shield
then
he
punched
him
in
the
stomach
with
the
wagon
tongue
so
hard
that
the
big
fellow
slipped
and
rolled
over
in
the
mud
picking
himself
up
giant
blubb
now
half
blind
with
rage
rushed
against
tom
who
this
time
made
a
lunge
which
planted
the
cart
tongue
inside
blubb
bowels
and
knocked
him
over
but
tom
was
not
a
cruel
fellow
and
had
no
desire
to
kill
anyone
so
he
threw
down
his
war
tools
and
tearing
up
a
yard
or
two
of
grassy
sod
rolled
it
together
and
made
a
plug
of
it
as
big
around
as
a
milk
churn
with
this
he
stopped
up
the
big
hole
in
giant
blubb
huge
body
but
instead
of
thanking
tom
giant
blubb
rushed
at
him
again
he
was
in
too
much
of
a
rage
to
see
anything
clearly
while
tom
perfectly
cool
gave
the
angry
monster
such
a
kick
in
the
place
where
he
kept
his
dinner
that
he
rolled
over
and
tom
gave
him
another
kick
then
the
plug
of
sod
fell
out
of
his
wound
as
he
was
bleeding
to
death
giant
blubb
beckoned
to
tom
to
come
up
close
for
he
could
only
whisper
you
beaten
me
on
the
square
and
i
like
you
do
think
i
killed
my
twenty
wives
they
all
died

a
boy
that
visited
fairyland
many
are
the
places
in
wales
where
the
ground
is
lumpy
and
humpy
with
tumuli
or
little
artificial
mounds
among
these
the
sheep
graze
the
donkeys
bray
and
the
cows
chew
the
cud
here
the
ground
is
strewn
with
the
ruins
of
cromlechs
or
cymric
strongholds
of
old
roman
camps
of
chapels
and
monasteries
showing
that
many
different
races
of
men
have
come
and
gone
while
the
birds
still
fly
and
the
flowers
bloom
centuries
ago
the
good
monks
of
david
had
a
school
where
lads
were
taught
latin
and
good
manners
one
of
their
pupils
was
a
boy
named
elidyr
he
was
such
a
poor
scholar
and
he
so
hated
books
and
loved
play
that
in
his
case
spankings
and
whippings
were
almost
of
daily
occurrence
still
he
made
no
improvement
he
was
in
the
habit
also
of
playing
truant
or
what
one
of
the
monks
called
traveling
to
bagdad
one
of
the
consequences
was
that
certain
soft
parts
of
his
body
apparently
provided
by
nature
for
this
express
purpose
often
received
a
warming
from
his
daddy
his
mother
loved
her
boy
dearly
and
she
often
gently
chided
him
but
he
would
not
listen
to
her
and
when
she
urged
him
to
be
more
diligent
he
ran
out
of
the
room
the
monks
did
not
spare
the
birch
rod
and
soon
it
was
a
case
of
a
whipping
for
every
lesson
not
learned
one
day
though
he
was
only
twelve
years
old
the
boy
started
on
a
long
run
into
the
country
the
further
he
got
the
happier
he
felt
at
least
for
one
day
at
night
tired
out
he
crept
into
a
cave
when
he
woke
up
in
the
morning
he
thought
it
was
glorious
to
be
as
free
as
the
wild
asses
so
like
them
he
quenched
his
thirst
at
the
brook
but
when
towards
noon
he
could
find
nothing
to
eat
and
his
inside
cavity
seemed
to
enlarge
with
very
emptiness
his
hunger
grew
every
minute
then
he
thought
that
a
bit
of
oat
cake
a
leek
or
a
bowl
of
oat
meal
whether
porridge
or
flummery
might
suit
a
king
he
dared
not
go
out
far
and
pick
berries
for
by
this
time
he
saw
that
people
were
out
searching
for
him
he
did
not
feel
yet
like
going
back
to
books
rods
and
scoldings
but
the
day
seemed
as
long
as
a
week
meanwhile
he
discovered
that
he
had
a
stomach
which
seemed
to
grow
more
and
more
into
an
aching
void
he
was
glad
when
the
sunset
and
darkness
came
his
bed
was
no
softer
in
the
cave
as
he
lay
down
with
a
stone
for
his
pillow
yet
he
had
no
dreams
like
those
of
jacob
and
the
angels
when
daylight
came
the
question
in
his
mind
was
still
whether
to
stay
and
starve
or
to
go
home
and
get
two
thrashings
one
from
his
daddy
and
another
from
the
monks
but
how
about
that
thing
inside
of
him
which
seemed
to
be
a
live
creature
gnawing
away
and
which
only
something
to
eat
would
quiet
finally
he
came
to
a
stern
resolve
he
started
out
ready
to
face
two
whippings
rather
than
one
death
by
starvation
but
he
did
not
have
to
go
home
yet
for
at
the
cave
mouth
he
met
two
elves
who
delivered
a
most
welcome
message
come
with
us
to
a
land
full
of
fun
play
and
good
things
to
eat
all
at
once
his
hunger
left
him
and
he
forgot
that
he
ever
wanted
to
swallow
anything
all
fear
or
desire
to
go
home
or
to
risk
either
schooling
or
a
thrashing
passed
away
also
into
a
dark
passage
all
three
went
but
they
soon
came
out
into
a
beautiful
country
how
the
birds
sang
and
the
flowers
bloomed
all
around
could
be
heard
the
joyful
shouts
of
little
folks
at
play
never
did
things
look
so
lovely
illustration
the
king
spoke
kindly
to
elidyr
asking
him
who
he
was
soon
in
front
of
the
broad
path
along
which
they
were
traveling
there
rose
up
before
him
a
glorious
palace
it
had
a
splendid
gateway
and
the
towers
seemed
to
touch
the
blue
sky
what
building
is
this
asked
the
lad
of
his
two
guides
they
made
answer
that
it
was
the
palace
of
the
king
of
fairyland
then
they
led
him
into
the
throne
room
where
sat
in
golden
splendor
a
king
of
august
figure
and
of
majestic
presence
who
was
clad
in
resplendent
robes
he
was
surrounded
by
courtiers
in
rich
apparel
and
all
about
him
was
magnificence
such
as
this
boy
elidyr
had
never
even
read
about
or
dreamed
yet
everything
was
so
small
that
it
looked
like
toy
land
and
he
felt
like
a
giant
among
them
even
though
many
of
the
little
men
around
him
were
old
enough
to
have
whiskers
on
their
cheeks
and
beards
on
their
chins
the
king
spoke
kindly
to
elidyr
asking
him
who
he
was
and
whence
he
had
come
while
talking
thus
the
prince
the
king
only
son
appeared
he
was
dressed
in
white
velvet
and
gold
and
had
a
long
feather
in
his
cap
in
the
pleasantest
way
he
took
elidyr
hand
and
said
glad
to
see
you
come
and
let
us
play
together
that
was
just
what
elidyr
liked
to
hear
the
king
smiled
and
said
to
his
visitor
you
will
attend
my
son
then
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
signified
to
the
boys
to
run
out
and
play
games
a
right
merry
time
they
did
have
for
there
were
many
other
little
fellows
for
playmates
these
wee
folks
with
whom
elidyr
played
were
hardly
as
big
as
our
babies
and
certainly
would
not
reach
up
to
his
mother
knee
to
them
he
looked
like
a
giant
and
he
richly
enjoyed
the
fun
of
having
such
little
men
but
with
beards
growing
on
their
faces
look
up
to
him
they
played
with
golden
balls
and
rode
little
horses
with
silver
saddles
and
bridles
but
these
pretty
animals
were
no
larger
than
small
dogs
or
grayhounds
no
meat
was
ever
seen
on
the
table
but
always
plenty
of
milk
they
never
told
a
lie
nor
used
bad
language
or
they
often
talked
about
mortal
men
but
usually
to
despise
them
because
what
they
liked
to
do
seemed
so
absurd
and
they
always
wanted
foolish
and
useless
things
to
the
elves
human
beings
were
never
satisfied
or
long
happy
even
when
they
got
what
they
wanted
everything
in
this
part
of
fairyland
was
lovely
but
it
was
always
cloudy
no
sun
star
or
moon
was
ever
seen
yet
the
little
men
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
and
enjoyed
themselves
every
day
there
was
no
end
of
play
and
that
suited
elidyr
yet
by
and
by
he
got
tired
even
of
games
and
play
and
grew
very
homesick
he
wanted
to
see
his
mother
so
he
asked
the
king
to
let
him
visit
his
old
home
he
promised
solemnly
to
come
back
after
a
few
hours
his
majesty
gave
his
permission
but
charged
him
not
to
take
with
him
anything
whatever
from
fairyland
and
to
go
with
only
the
clothes
on
his
back
the
same
two
elves
or
dwarfs
who
had
brought
him
into
fairyland
were
chosen
to
conduct
him
back
when
they
had
led
him
again
through
the
underground
passage
into
the
sunlight
they
made
him
invisible
until
he
arrived
at
his
mother
cottage
she
was
overjoyed
to
find
that
no
wolf
had
torn
him
to
pieces
or
wild
bull
had
pushed
him
over
a
precipice
she
asked
him
many
questions
and
he
told
her
all
he
had
seen
felt
or
known
when
he
rose
up
to
go
she
begged
him
to
stay
longer
but
he
said
he
must
keep
his
word
besides
he
feared
the
rod
of
the
monks
or
his
daddy
if
he
remained
so
he
made
his
mother
agree
not
to
tell
anything
not
even
to
his
father
as
to
where
he
was
or
what
he
was
doing
then
he
made
off
and
reported
again
to
his
playmates
in
fairyland
the
king
was
so
pleased
at
the
lad
promptness
in
returning
and
keeping
his
word
and
telling
the
truth
that
he
allowed
him
to
go
see
his
mother
as
often
as
he
wanted
to
do
so
he
even
gave
orders
releasing
the
two
little
men
from
constantly
guarding
him
and
told
them
to
let
the
lad
go
alone
and
when
he
would
for
he
always
kept
his
word
many
times
did
elidyr
visit
his
mother
by
one
road
or
another
he
made
his
way
keeping
himself
invisible
all
the
time
until
he
got
inside
her
cottage
he
ran
off
when
anyone
called
in
to
pay
a
visit
or
when
he
thought
his
daddy
or
one
of
the
monks
was
coming
he
never
saw
any
of
these
men
one
day
in
telling
his
mother
of
the
fun
and
good
times
he
had
in
fairyland
he
spoke
of
the
heavy
yellow
balls
with
which
he
and
the
king
sons
played
and
how
these
rolled
around
before
leaving
home
this
boy
had
never
seen
any
gold
and
did
not
know
what
it
was
but
his
mother
guessed
that
it
was
the
precious
metal
of
which
the
coins
called
sovereigns
and
worth
five
dollars
apiece
were
made
so
she
begged
him
to
bring
one
of
them
back
to
her
this
elidyr
thought
would
not
be
right
but
after
much
argument
his
parents
being
poor
and
she
telling
him
that
out
of
hundreds
in
the
king
palace
one
single
ball
would
not
be
missed
he
decided
to
please
her
so
one
day
when
he
supposed
no
one
was
looking
he
picked
up
one
of
the
yellow
balls
and
started
off
through
the
narrow
dark
passageway
homeward
but
no
sooner
was
he
back
on
the
earth
and
in
the
sunlight
again
than
he
heard
footsteps
behind
him
then
he
knew
that
he
had
been
discovered
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
and
there
were
the
two
little
men
who
had
led
him
first
and
had
formerly
been
his
guards
they
scowled
at
him
as
if
they
were
mad
enough
to
bite
off
the
heads
of
tenpenny
nails
then
they
rushed
after
him
and
there
began
a
race
to
the
cottage
but
the
boy
had
legs
twice
as
long
as
the
little
men
and
got
to
the
cottage
door
first
he
now
thought
himself
safe
but
pushing
open
the
door
he
stumbled
over
the
copper
threshold
and
the
ball
rolled
out
of
his
hand
across
the
floor
of
hardened
clay
even
to
the
nearly
border
which
ran
about
the
edges
of
the
room
it
stopped
at
the
feet
of
his
mother
whose
eyes
opened
wide
at
the
sight
of
the
ball
of
shining
gold
as
he
lay
sprawling
on
the
floor
and
before
he
could
pick
himself
up
one
of
the
little
men
leaped
over
him
rushed
into
the
room
and
from
under
his
mother
petticoats
picked
up
the
ball
they
spat
at
the
boy
and
shouted
traitor
rascal
thief
false
mortal
fox
rat
wolf
and
other
bad
names
then
they
turned
and
sped
away
now
elidyr
though
he
had
been
a
mischievous
boy
often
willful
lazy
and
never
liking
his
books
had
always
loved
the
truth
he
was
very
sad
and
miserable
beyond
the
telling
because
he
had
broken
his
word
of
honor
so
almost
mad
with
grief
and
shame
and
from
an
accusing
conscience
he
went
back
to
find
the
cave
in
which
he
had
slept
he
would
return
to
the
king
of
the
fairies
and
ask
his
pardon
even
if
his
majesty
never
allowed
him
to
visit
fairyland
again
but
though
he
often
searched
and
spent
whole
days
in
trying
to
find
the
opening
in
the
hills
he
could
never
discover
it
so
fully
penitent
and
resolving
to
live
right
and
become
what
his
father
wanted
him
to
be
he
went
back
to
the
monastery
there
he
plied
his
tasks
so
diligently
that
he
excelled
all
in
in
time
he
became
one
of
the
most
famous
scholars
in
welsh
history
when
he
died
he
asked
to
be
buried
not
in
the
cemetery
but
with
his
father
and
mother
in
the
churchyard
he
made
request
that
no
name
record
or
epitaph
be
chiseled
on
his
tomb
but
only
these
words
we
can
do
nothing
against
the
truth
but
only
for
the
truth
xiv
the
welshery
and
the
normans
though
their
land
has
been
many
times
invaded
the
welsh
have
never
been
conquered
powerful
tribes
like
the
romans
saxons
and
normans
have
tried
to
overwhelm
them
even
when
english
and
german
kings
attempted
to
crush
their
spirit
and
blot
out
their
language
and
literature
the
welsh
resisted
and
won
victory
among
the
bullies
that
tried
force
instead
of
justice
and
played
the
rather
than
the
good
samaritan
way
were
the
normans
these
brutal
fellows
when
they
thought
that
they
had
overrun
wales
with
their
armies
began
to
build
strong
castles
all
over
the
country
they
kept
armed
men
by
the
thousands
ready
night
and
day
to
rush
out
and
put
to
death
anybody
and
everybody
who
had
a
weapon
in
his
hand
often
they
burned
whole
villages
they
killed
so
many
welsh
people
that
it
seemed
at
times
as
if
they
expected
to
empty
the
land
of
its
inhabitants
thus
they
hoped
to
possess
all
the
acres
for
themselves
they
talked
as
if
there
were
no
people
so
refined
and
so
cultured
as
they
were
while
the
natives
good
and
bad
were
lumped
together
as
the
welshery
yet
all
this
time
with
these
hundreds
of
strong
castles
bristling
with
turrets
and
towers
no
englishman
life
was
safe
if
he
dared
to
go
out
alone
even
twenty
rods
from
the
castle
he
was
instantly
killed
by
some
angry
welshman
lying
in
ambush
so
the
normans
had
to
lock
themselves
up
in
armor
until
they
looked
like
lobsters
in
their
shells
when
on
their
horses
they
resembled
turtles
so
that
if
a
knight
fell
off
he
had
to
be
chopped
open
to
be
rid
of
his
metal
clothes
yet
all
this
was
in
vain
for
when
the
norman
marched
out
in
bodies
or
rode
in
squadrons
the
welshery
kept
away
and
were
hidden
even
the
birds
and
beasts
noticed
this
and
saw
what
fools
the
normans
were
to
behave
so
brutally
as
for
the
fairies
they
met
together
to
see
what
could
be
done
even
the
reptiles
shamed
men
by
living
together
more
peaceably
only
the
beasts
of
prey
approved
of
the
norman
way
of
treating
the
welsh
people
at
last
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
long
war
of
the
roses
when
the
reds
and
the
whites
had
fought
together
a
welsh
king
sat
upon
the
throne
of
england
henry
viii
was
of
cymric
ancestry
his
full
name
was
henry
tudor
or
in
english
henry
theodore
among
the
welsh
every
son
to
his
own
name
as
a
child
such
as
henry
william
thomas
added
that
of
his
father
thus
it
happens
that
we
can
usually
tell
a
man
by
his
name
for
example
richards
roberts
evans
jones
that
he
is
a
welshman
when
a
welshman
went
into
england
to
live
if
he
were
a
sister
son
he
usually
added
a
syllable
showing
this
as
in
the
case
of
jefferson
which
means
sister
son
our
great
thomas
jefferson
used
to
boast
that
he
could
talk
welsh
so
the
living
creatures
of
all
sorts
in
wales
human
beings
fairies
and
animals
took
heart
and
plucked
up
courage
when
a
tudor
king
henry
viii
sat
on
the
throne
now
it
was
puck
who
led
the
fairies
as
the
great
peacemaker
he
went
first
to
visit
all
the
most
ancient
creatures
in
order
to
find
out
who
should
be
offered
the
post
of
honor
as
ambassador
who
should
be
sent
to
the
great
king
in
london
henry
tudor
to
see
what
could
be
done
for
wales
first
he
called
on
the
male
eagle
oldest
of
all
birds
though
not
like
his
american
cousin
the
welsh
eagle
was
very
old
and
at
that
time
a
widower
although
he
had
been
father
to
nine
generations
of
eaglets
he
sent
puck
to
the
stag
this
splendid
creature
with
magnificent
antlers
lived
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
near
the
trunk
of
an
oak
tree
it
was
still
standing
but
was
now
a
mere
shell
old
men
said
that
the
children
of
the
aborigines
played
under
it
and
here
was
the
home
of
the
god
of
lightning
which
they
worshiped
so
to
the
withered
oak
puck
went
and
offered
him
the
honor
of
leadership
to
an
embassy
to
the
king
but
the
stag
answered
and
said
well
do
i
remember
when
an
acorn
fell
from
the
top
of
the
parent
oak
then
for
three
hundred
years
it
was
growing
children
played
under
it
they
gathered
acorns
in
their
aprons
and
the
archers
made
bows
from
its
boughs
then
the
oak
tree
began
to
die
and
during
nearly
thirty
tens
of
years
it
has
been
fading
and
i
have
seen
it
all
yet
there
is
one
older
than
i
it
is
the
salmon
that
swims
in
the
llyn
stream
inquire
there
so
of
the
old
mother
salmon
puck
went
to
ask
and
this
was
the
answer
which
he
received
count
all
the
spots
on
my
body
and
all
the
eggs
in
my
roe
one
for
each
year
yet
the
blackbird
is
older
even
than
i
go
listen
to
her
story
she
excels
me
in
both
talk
and
fact
and
the
blackbird
opened
its
bill
and
answered
proudly
do
you
see
this
flinty
rock
on
which
i
am
sitting
once
it
was
so
huge
that
three
hundred
yoke
of
oxen
could
hardly
move
it
yet
today
it
hardly
more
than
affords
me
room
to
roost
on
what
made
it
so
small
do
you
ask
well
all
i
have
clone
to
wear
it
away
has
been
to
wipe
my
beak
on
it
every
night
before
i
go
to
sleep
and
in
the
morning
to
brush
it
with
the
tips
of
my
wing
even
puck
fairy
though
he
was
was
astonished
at
this
but
the
blackbird
added
go
to
the
toad
that
blinks
its
eye
under
the
big
rock
yonder
his
age
is
greater
than
mine
the
toad
was
half
asleep
when
puck
came
but
it
opened
with
alertness
its
beautiful
round
bright
eyes
set
in
a
rim
of
gold
then
puck
asked
the
question
oh
thou
that
carriest
a
jewel
in
thy
head
are
there
any
things
alive
that
are
older
than
thou
art
that
i
could
not
be
sure
of
especially
if
as
many
false
things
are
told
about
them
as
are
told
about
me
but
when
i
was
a
tadpole
in
the
pond
that
old
hag
of
an
owl
was
still
hooting
away
in
the
treetops
scaring
children
as
in
ages
gone
she
is
older
than
i
go
and
see
her
if
age
makes
wise
she
is
the
wisest
of
all
puck
went
into
the
forest
but
at
first
saw
no
bird
answering
to
the
description
given
him
he
said
to
himself
she
is
i
wonder
who
he
was
surprised
to
hear
his
question
repeated
not
as
an
echo
but
by
another
still
he
thought
it
might
possibly
be
his
own
voice
come
back
so
in
making
a
catalogue
in
his
note
book
of
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
that
day
he
put
down
to
wit
one
echo
again
came
the
sound
to
whit
to
who
to
whit
to
who
sounded
the
voice
thinking
that
this
was
intended
to
be
a
polite
question
puck
looked
up
sure
enough
there
was
the
wise
bird
sitting
on
a
bough
above
him
as
sober
as
a
judge
who
did
you
ask
answered
puck
and
then
went
on
to
explain
i
am
lord
of
the
fairies
in
welshery
and
i
seek
to
know
which
is
the
most
venerable
of
all
the
creatures
in
the
land
of
the
red
dragon
i
am
ready
to
salute
you
as
the
most
ancient
and
honorable
of
all
living
things
in
the
cymric
realm
you
are
desired
to
bear
a
message
to
the
great
king
in
london
tickled
by
such
delicate
flattery
and
the
honors
proffered
her
this
lady
owl
after
much
blinking
and
winking
flirting
and
fluttering
at
last
agreed
to
go
to
king
henry
viii
in
london
the
business
with
which
she
was
charged
was
to
protest
against
norman
brutality
and
to
plead
for
justice
now
this
old
gray
with
centuries
though
she
had
such
short
ears
kept
them
open
by
day
and
during
the
night
also
for
all
the
gossip
that
floated
in
the
air
she
knew
all
about
everybody
and
everything
from
what
she
had
heard
she
expected
to
find
the
new
king
henry
viii
a
royal
fellow
in
velvet
with
a
crown
on
his
head
and
his
body
as
big
and
round
as
a
hogshead
sitting
in
a
room
full
of
chopping
blocks
and
battle
axes
further
she
fancied
she
would
find
a
dozen
pretty
women
locked
up
in
his
palace
some
in
the
cellar
others
in
the
pantry
and
more
in
the
garret
but
all
waiting
to
have
their
heads
chopped
off
for
the
popular
story
ran
that
his
chief
amusement
was
to
marry
a
wife
one
day
and
slice
off
her
head
the
next
it
was
said
also
that
the
king
kept
a
private
graveyard
and
took
a
walk
in
it
every
afternoon
to
study
the
epitaphs
which
he
kept
a
scholar
busy
in
writing
and
also
a
man
from
the
marble
yard
near
by
to
chisel
them
on
the
tombs
after
his
various
wives
had
been
properly
beheaded
but
the
owl
never
could
find
out
whether
these
fables
were
wicked
fibs
or
fairy
tales
or
only
street
talk
puck
and
the
owl
together
arrived
in
london
at
the
palace
when
the
king
was
at
his
dinner
the
butlers
and
lackeys
wanted
to
keep
them
out
but
the
merry
monarch
gave
orders
to
let
them
in
at
once
he
made
the
owl
perch
over
the
mantel
piece
but
told
puck
to
stand
upon
the
dinner
table
and
walk
over
the
tablecloth
the
pepper
box
was
put
away
so
that
he
should
not
sneeze
and
the
king
carefully
removed
the
mustard
pot
for
fear
the
little
fairy
fellow
might
fall
in
it
and
be
drowned
in
the
hot
stuff
his
majesty
said
that
for
the
time
being
puck
should
be
the
prince
of
wales
puck
strutted
about
to
the
amusement
of
the
king
and
all
the
court
ladies
but
he
kept
away
from
the
pepper
which
made
his
nose
tingle
and
from
the
hot
soup
for
fear
he
might
tumble
into
it
and
be
scalded
when
the
dessert
came
on
puck
hid
himself
under
a
walnut
shell
just
for
fun
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
about
all
that
was
said
or
the
questions
which
the
king
asked
about
his
welsh
subjects
and
which
either
the
owl
or
the
fairy
man
answered
according
to
puck
story
wales
was
then
a
most
distressful
country
though
the
welshery
to
a
man
wanted
to
be
good
and
loyal
subjects
of
the
tudors
several
times
did
puck
appeal
to
the
owl
to
have
his
story
confirmed
because
this
wise
bird
had
lived
among
the
cymry
centuries
before
the
normans
came
the
owl
every
time
blinked
bowed
and
answered
solemnly
to
whit
to
who
to
whit
to
who
which
in
this
case
showed
that
she
had
learned
to
speak
the
court
language
why
bless
my
soul
the
owl
speaks
good
cockney
hinglish
whispered
one
of
the
butlers
who
had
been
born
in
wales
yes
but
that
is
the
proper
way
to
address
his
majesty
king
ennery
the
heighth
answered
the
other
butler
who
was
a
londoner
puck
and
the
owl
returned
to
wales
what
happened
after
that
is
the
a
b
c
of
history
that
everybody
knows
and
for
which
all
the
welsh
people
to
this
day
bless
the
tudors
who
made
the
welsh
equal
before
the
law
with
any
and
all
englishmen
even
puck
himself
had
never
seen
anything
like
the
change
that
quickly
took
place
for
the
better
nor
did
queen
mab
with
her
wand
ever
work
such
wonders
it
was
better
than
a
fairy
tale
and
the
effects
very
soon
seen
were
even
more
wonderful
down
went
the
castles
into
ruins
for
rats
to
run
around
in
and
wild
dogs
to
yelp
and
foxes
to
hide
in
or
look
out
of
the
casements
what
were
once
banqueting
halls
are
covered
with
moss
and
on
the
ground
grass
grows
over
which
sheep
graze
and
children
play
while
rooks
and
crows
nest
or
roost
in
the
tall
towers
any
englishman
life
was
safe
anywhere
and
wales
became
one
of
the
most
easily
governed
countries
in
all
the
wonderful
british
empire
and
in
the
great
that
even
children
who
read
these
stories
can
remember
wales
the
land
of
the
free
the
home
of
deathless
democracy
led
all
the
british
isles
colonies
islands
or
coaling
stations
around
the
wide
world
in
loyalty
valor
and
sacrifice
and
the
handsome
son
of
the
king
george
the
prince
of
wales
led
the
descendants
of
welsh
archers
now
called
the
fusileers
they
went
into
battle
singing
old
land
our
fathers
before
us
held
so
dear
or
they
marched
following
the
band
that
played
the
men
of
harlech
it
is
because
welsh
cherish
their
traditions
harps
music
language
and
noble
inheritances
with
which
they
feed
their
souls
that
they
lead
the
four
nations
of
the
british
isles
in
the
nobler
virtues
that
keep
a
nation
alive
as
well
as
in
the
sweet
humanities
of
the
red
cross
and
in
generous
hospitality
to
the
refugee
belgian
true
to
his
motto
i
serve
the
prince
of
wales
who
came
to
see
us
in
as
did
his
grandfather
whom
the
saw
when
he
visited
our
independence
hall
in
loved
to
be
the
servant
of
his
people
what
was
it
that
wrought
this
peaceful
wonder
of
the
sixteenth
century
was
it
a
fairy
spell
magic
ointment
wand
treasures
of
caves
or
ocean
depths
was
it
anything
that
dragons
giants
ogres
or
even
swords
spears
catapults
or
whips
and
clubs
or
elves
or
gnomes
could
do
not
a
bit
of
it
only
justice
and
kindness
instead
of
brutality
and
force
xv
the
welsh
fairies
hold
a
meeting
in
the
ancient
cymric
gatherings
the
druids
poets
prophets
seers
and
singers
all
had
part
the
one
most
honored
as
the
president
of
the
meeting
was
crowned
and
garlanded
then
he
was
led
in
honor
and
sat
in
the
chair
of
state
they
called
this
great
occasion
an
eistedfodd
or
sitting
after
the
cymric
word
meaning
a
chair
all
over
the
world
the
welsh
folks
who
do
so
passionately
love
music
poetry
and
their
own
grand
language
hold
the
eistedfodd
at
regular
intervals
thus
they
renew
their
love
for
the
fatherland
and
what
they
received
long
ago
from
their
ancestors
now
it
happens
that
the
fairies
in
every
land
usually
follow
the
customs
of
the
mortals
among
whom
they
live
the
swiss
the
dutch
the
belgian
the
japanese
and
korean
fairies
as
we
all
know
although
they
are
much
alike
in
many
things
are
as
different
from
each
other
as
the
countries
in
which
they
live
and
play
so
when
the
welsh
fairies
all
met
together
they
resolved
to
have
songs
and
harp
music
and
make
the
piper
play
his
tunes
just
as
in
the
eistedfodd
the
cymric
fairies
of
our
days
have
had
many
troubles
to
complain
of
they
were
disgusted
with
so
much
coal
smoke
the
poisoning
of
the
air
by
chemical
fumes
and
the
blackening
of
the
landscape
from
so
many
factory
chimneys
they
had
other
grievances
also
so
the
queen
mab
who
had
a
welsh
name
and
another
fairy
called
pwca
or
in
english
king
puck
sent
out
invitations
into
every
part
of
wales
for
a
gathering
on
the
hills
near
the
great
rock
called
seat
this
is
a
rocky
chair
formed
by
nature
they
also
included
in
their
call
those
parts
of
western
and
south
england
such
as
are
still
welsh
and
spiritually
almost
a
part
of
wales
in
fact
cornwall
was
the
old
land
in
which
the
cymry
had
first
landed
when
coming
from
over
the
sea
the
meeting
was
to
be
held
on
a
moonlight
night
and
far
away
from
any
houses
lest
the
merry
making
dancing
and
singing
of
the
fairies
should
keep
the
farmers
awake
this
was
something
of
which
the
yokels
or
men
of
the
plow
often
complained
they
could
not
sleep
while
the
fairies
were
having
their
parties
now
among
the
welsh
fairies
of
every
sort
size
dress
and
behavior
some
were
good
others
were
bad
but
most
of
them
were
only
full
of
fun
and
mischief
chief
of
these
was
the
lively
little
fellow
puck
who
lived
in
cwm
pwcca
that
is
puck
valley
in
breconshire
now
it
had
been
an
old
custom
which
had
come
down
from
the
days
of
the
cave
men
that
when
anyone
died
the
people
friends
and
relatives
sat
up
all
night
with
the
corpse
the
custom
arose
at
first
with
the
idea
of
protection
against
wild
beasts
and
later
from
insult
by
enemies
this
was
called
a
wake
the
watchers
wept
and
wailed
at
first
and
then
fell
to
eating
and
drinking
sometimes
they
got
to
be
very
lively
the
young
folks
even
looked
on
a
wake
after
the
first
hour
or
two
as
fine
fun
strong
liquor
was
too
plentiful
and
it
often
happened
that
quarrels
broke
out
when
heads
were
thus
fuddled
men
saw
or
thought
they
saw
many
uncanny
things
like
leather
birds
cave
eagles
and
the
like
but
all
these
fantastic
things
and
creatures
such
as
foolish
people
talk
about
and
with
which
they
frighten
children
such
as
corpse
candles
demons
and
imps
were
ruled
out
and
not
invited
to
the
fairy
meeting
some
other
objects
which
ignorant
folks
believed
in
were
not
to
be
allowed
in
the
company
the
was
notified
not
to
admit
the
eagles
of
darkness
that
live
in
a
cave
which
is
never
lighted
up
or
the
weird
featherless
bird
of
leather
from
the
land
of
illusion
and
phantasy
that
brushes
its
wing
against
windows
when
a
funeral
is
soon
to
take
place
or
the
greedy
dog
with
silver
eyes
none
of
these
would
be
permitted
to
show
themselves
even
if
they
came
and
tried
to
get
in
some
other
creatures
not
recognized
in
the
good
society
of
fairyland
were
also
barred
out
to
this
gathering
only
the
bright
and
lively
fairies
were
welcome
some
of
the
best
natured
among
the
big
creatures
and
especially
giants
and
dragons
might
pay
a
visit
if
they
wanted
to
do
so
but
all
the
bad
ones
such
as
lake
hags
wraiths
sellers
of
liquids
for
wakes
who
made
men
drunk
and
all
who
under
the
guise
of
fairies
were
only
agents
for
undertakers
were
ruled
out
the
night
dogs
of
the
wicked
hunter
annum
the
monster
afang
cadwallader
goats
and
various
cruel
goblins
and
ogres
living
in
the
ponds
and
that
pulled
cattle
down
to
eat
them
up
and
the
immodest
mermaids
whose
bad
behavior
was
so
well
known
were
crossed
off
the
list
of
invitations
no
ugly
brats
such
as
wicked
fairies
were
in
the
habit
of
putting
in
the
cradles
of
mortal
mothers
when
they
stole
away
their
babies
were
allowed
to
be
present
even
if
they
should
come
with
their
mothers
this
was
to
be
a
perfectly
respectable
company
and
no
bawling
squealing
crying
or
blubbering
was
to
be
permitted
when
they
had
all
gathered
together
at
the
evening
hour
there
was
seen
in
the
moonlight
the
funniest
lot
of
creatures
that
one
could
imagine
but
all
were
neatly
dressed
and
well
behaved
quite
a
large
number
of
the
famous
fair
family
that
moved
only
in
the
best
society
of
fairyland
fathers
mothers
cousins
uncles
and
aunts
were
on
hand
in
fact
some
of
them
had
thought
it
was
to
be
a
wake
and
were
ready
for
whatever
might
turn
up
whether
solemn
or
frivolous
these
were
dressed
in
varied
costume
queen
mab
who
above
all
else
was
a
welsh
fairy
and
whose
name
as
everybody
knows
who
talks
cymric
suggested
her
extreme
youth
and
lively
disposition
was
present
in
all
her
glory
when
they
saw
her
several
learned
fairies
who
had
come
from
a
distance
fell
at
once
into
conversation
on
this
subject
one
remarked
how
would
the
queen
like
to
add
another
syllable
to
her
name
then
we
should
call
her
which
means
kitten
or
little
puss
well
not
so
bad
however
because
many
mortal
daddies
who
have
a
daughter
call
her
puss
it
is
a
term
of
affection
with
them
and
the
little
girls
never
seem
to
be
offended
oh
suppose
that
in
talking
to
each
other
we
call
our
queen
what
then
asked
another
with
a
roguish
twinkle
in
the
eye
it
depends
on
how
you
use
it
said
a
wise
one
dryly
this
fairy
was
a
stickler
for
the
correct
use
of
every
word
if
you
meant
or
she
or
her
friends
might
demur
but
if
you
use
the
term
of
children
what
better
name
for
a
fairy
queen
none
there
could
not
be
any
they
shouted
all
at
once
but
let
us
ask
our
old
friend
the
harper
now
such
a
thing
as
inquiring
into
each
other
ages
was
not
common
in
fairy
land
very
few
ever
asked
such
a
question
for
it
was
not
thought
to
be
polite
for
though
we
hear
of
ugly
fairy
brats
being
put
into
the
cradles
in
place
of
pretty
children
no
one
ever
heard
either
of
fairies
being
born
or
of
dying
or
having
clocks
or
watches
or
looking
to
see
what
time
it
was
nor
did
doctors
or
the
census
clerks
or
directory
people
ever
trouble
the
fairy
ladies
to
ask
their
age
occasionally
however
there
was
one
fairy
so
wise
so
learned
and
so
able
to
tell
what
was
going
to
happen
or
next
year
that
the
other
fairies
looked
up
to
such
an
one
with
respect
and
awe
yet
these
honorables
would
hardly
know
what
you
were
talking
about
if
you
asked
any
of
them
how
old
they
might
be
or
spoke
of
old
or
young
if
by
any
chance
a
fairy
did
use
the
world
old
in
talking
of
their
number
it
would
be
for
honor
or
dignity
and
they
would
mean
it
for
a
compliment
the
fact
was
that
many
of
the
most
lively
fairies
showed
their
frivolous
disposition
at
once
these
were
of
the
kind
that
like
kittens
cubs
or
babies
wanted
to
play
all
the
time
yes
every
moment
already
hundreds
of
them
were
tripping
from
flower
to
flower
riding
on
the
backs
of
fireflies
or
harnessing
night
moths
or
any
winged
creatures
they
could
saddle
for
flight
through
the
air
or
they
were
waltzing
with
glow
worms
or
playing
ring
around
a
rosy
or
dancing
in
circles
they
could
not
keep
still
one
moment
in
fact
when
a
great
crowd
of
the
frolicsome
creatures
got
singing
together
they
made
such
a
noise
that
a
squad
of
fairy
policemen
dressed
in
club
moss
and
armed
with
pistils
was
sent
to
warn
them
not
to
raise
their
voices
too
high
lest
the
farmers
especially
those
that
were
kind
to
the
fairies
should
be
awakened
and
feel
in
bad
humor
so
the
knot
of
learned
fairies
had
a
quiet
time
to
talk
and
when
able
to
hear
their
own
words
the
harper
who
was
very
learned
answered
their
questions
about
queen
mab
as
follows
well
you
know
the
famous
children
story
book
in
which
mortals
read
about
us
and
which
they
say
they
enjoy
so
much
is
named
mabinogion
that
is
the
young
folks
treasury
of
cymric
stories
it
is
well
named
said
another
fairy
savant
since
queen
mab
is
the
only
fairy
that
waits
on
men
she
inspires
their
dreams
when
these
are
born
in
their
brains
the
talk
now
turned
on
puck
who
was
to
be
the
president
of
the
meeting
they
were
expected
to
show
much
dignity
in
his
presence
but
some
feared
he
would
as
usual
play
his
pranks
before
he
arrived
in
his
chariot
which
was
drawn
by
dragon
flies
some
of
his
neighbors
that
lived
in
the
valley
near
by
chatted
about
him
until
the
gossip
became
quite
personal
just
for
the
fun
of
it
and
the
amusement
of
the
crowd
they
wanted
puck
to
give
an
exhibition
of
all
his
very
varied
accomplishments
for
he
could
beat
all
rivals
in
his
special
variety
or
as
musicians
say
his
repertoire
no
be
too
much
like
a
merry
andrew
or
a
sideshow
where
the
freaks
of
all
sorts
are
gathered
such
as
they
have
at
those
county
fairs
which
the
mortals
get
up
to
which
are
gathered
great
crowds
the
charge
of
admission
is
a
sixpence
i
vote
well
for
the
very
reason
that
puck
can
beat
the
rest
of
us
at
spells
and
transformations
i
should
like
to
see
him
do
for
us
as
many
stunts
as
he
can
i
heard
from
a
mortal
named
shakespeare
that
in
one
performance
puck
could
be
a
horse
a
hound
a
hog
a
bear
without
any
head
and
even
kindle
himself
into
a
fire
while
his
vocal
powers
as
we
know
are
endless
he
can
neigh
bark
grunt
roar
and
even
burn
up
things
now
i
should
like
to
see
the
fairy
that
could
beat
him
at
tricks
it
was
puck
himself
who
told
the
world
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
all
these
things
and
i
want
to
see
whether
he
was
boasting
tut
tut
do
talk
that
way
about
our
king
said
a
fourth
fairy
all
this
was
only
chaff
and
fun
for
all
the
fairies
were
in
good
humor
they
were
only
talking
to
fill
up
the
interval
until
the
music
began
now
the
canny
welsh
fairies
had
learned
the
trick
of
catching
farthings
pennies
and
sixpences
from
the
folks
who
have
more
curiosity
in
them
than
even
fairies
do
these
human
beings
cunning
fellows
that
they
are
let
the
curtain
fall
on
a
show
just
at
the
most
interesting
part
then
they
tell
you
to
come
next
day
and
find
out
what
is
to
happen
or
as
they
say
in
a
story
paper
to
be
continued
in
our
next
or
worse
than
all
the
story
teller
stops
at
some
very
exciting
episode
and
then
passes
the
hat
or
around
to
get
the
copper
or
silver
of
his
listeners
before
he
will
go
on
this
time
however
it
was
puck
himself
who
came
forward
and
declared
that
unless
everyone
of
the
fairies
would
promise
to
attend
the
next
meeting
there
should
be
no
music
now
a
meeting
of
the
welshery
whether
fairies
or
human
without
music
was
a
thing
not
to
be
thought
of
so
although
at
first
some
fairies
grumbled
and
held
back
and
were
quite
sulky
about
it
even
muttering
other
grumpy
words
they
at
last
all
agreed
and
puck
sent
for
the
fiddler
to
make
music
for
the
dance
xvi
king
arthur
cave
in
our
time
every
boy
and
girl
knows
about
the
nuts
and
blossoms
the
twigs
and
the
hedges
the
roots
and
the
leaf
of
the
common
hazel
bush
and
everybody
has
heard
of
the
witch
hazel
in
old
days
they
made
use
of
the
forked
branches
of
the
hazel
as
a
divining
rod
with
this
they
believed
that
they
could
divine
or
find
out
the
presence
of
treasures
of
gold
and
silver
deep
down
in
the
earth
and
hidden
from
human
eyes
and
what
boy
or
girl
has
never
played
the
game
and
sung
the
ditty
london
bridge
is
falling
down
falling
down
falling
down
even
though
nobody
now
living
ever
saw
it
fall
now
our
story
is
about
a
hazel
rod
a
welshman
on
london
bridge
treasures
in
a
cave
and
what
happened
because
of
these
it
was
in
the
days
when
london
bridge
was
not
as
we
see
it
a
massive
structure
of
stone
and
iron
able
to
bear
up
hundreds
of
cars
wagons
horses
and
people
and
lighted
at
night
with
electric
bulbs
no
when
this
welshman
visited
london
the
bridge
had
a
line
of
shops
on
both
sides
of
the
passage
way
and
reaching
from
end
to
end
taffy
was
the
name
of
this
fellow
from
denbigh
in
wales
and
he
was
a
drover
he
had
brought
all
the
way
from
one
of
the
richest
of
the
welsh
provinces
a
great
drove
of
black
welsh
cattle
such
as
were
in
steady
demand
by
englishmen
who
have
always
been
lovers
of
roast
beef
escaping
all
the
risks
of
cattle
thieves
rustlers
and
highwaymen
he
had
sold
his
beeves
at
a
good
price
so
that
his
pockets
were
now
fairly
bulging
out
with
gold
coins
and
yet
this
fellow
wanted
more
but
first
before
going
home
he
would
see
the
sights
of
the
great
city
which
then
contained
about
a
hundred
thousand
people
while
he
was
handling
some
things
in
a
shop
to
decide
what
he
should
take
home
to
his
wife
his
three
daughters
and
his
two
little
boys
he
noticed
a
man
looking
intently
not
at
him
but
at
his
stick
after
a
while
the
stranger
came
up
to
him
and
asked
him
where
he
came
from
now
taffy
was
not
very
refined
in
his
manners
and
he
thought
it
none
of
the
fellow
business
he
was
very
surly
and
made
reply
in
a
gruff
voice
i
come
from
my
own
country
the
stranger
did
not
get
angry
but
in
a
polite
tone
made
answer
do
be
offended
at
my
question
tell
me
where
you
cut
that
hazel
stick
and
i
make
it
to
your
advantage
if
you
will
take
my
advice
even
yet
taffy
was
gruff
and
suspicious
what
business
is
it
of
yours
where
i
cut
my
hazel
stick
he
answered
well
it
may
matter
a
good
deal
to
you
if
you
will
tell
me
for
if
you
remember
the
place
and
can
lead
me
to
it
i
make
you
a
rich
man
for
near
that
spot
lies
a
great
treasure
taffy
was
not
much
of
a
thinker
apart
from
matters
concerning
cattle
and
his
brain
worked
slowly
he
was
sorely
puzzled
here
was
a
wizard
who
could
make
him
rich
and
he
did
so
love
to
jingle
gold
in
his
pockets
but
then
he
was
superstitious
he
feared
that
this
sorcerer
derived
all
his
uncanny
knowledge
from
demons
and
taffy
being
rather
much
of
a
sinner
feared
these
very
much
meanwhile
his
new
acquaintance
kept
on
persuading
him
finally
taffy
yielded
and
the
two
went
on
together
to
wales
now
in
this
country
there
are
many
stones
placed
in
position
showing
they
were
not
there
by
accident
but
were
reared
by
men
to
mark
some
old
battle
or
famous
event
and
for
this
rough
stone
work
no
country
unless
it
be
korea
or
china
is
more
famous
than
wales
on
reaching
one
called
the
fortress
rock
taffy
pointed
to
an
old
hazel
root
and
said
to
his
companion
there
from
that
stock
i
cut
my
hazel
stick
i
am
sure
of
it
the
sorcerer
looked
at
taffy
to
read
his
face
and
to
be
certain
that
he
was
telling
the
truth
then
he
said
bring
shovels
and
we
both
dig
these
having
been
brought
the
two
began
to
work
until
the
perspiration
stood
out
in
drops
on
their
foreheads
first
the
sod
and
rooty
stuff
and
then
down
around
the
gravelly
mass
below
they
plied
their
digging
tools
taffy
was
not
used
to
such
toil
and
his
muscles
were
soon
weary
but
urged
on
by
visions
of
gold
he
kept
bravely
at
his
task
at
last
when
ready
to
drop
from
fatigue
he
heard
his
companion
say
we
struck
it
a
few
shovelfuls
more
laid
bare
a
broad
flat
stone
this
they
pried
up
but
it
required
all
their
strength
to
lift
and
stand
it
on
edge
just
below
they
saw
a
flight
of
steps
they
were
slippery
with
wet
and
they
looked
very
old
as
if
worn
ages
ago
by
many
feet
passing
up
and
down
them
taffy
shrunk
back
as
a
draught
of
the
close
dead
air
struck
his
nostrils
come
on
and
do
be
afraid
i
going
to
make
you
rich
said
the
sorcerer
at
this
taffy
eyes
glistened
and
he
followed
on
down
the
steps
without
saying
a
word
at
the
bottom
of
the
descent
they
entered
a
narrow
passage
and
finally
came
to
a
door
now
i
ask
you
are
you
brave
and
will
you
come
in
with
me
if
i
open
this
door
by
this
time
taffy
was
so
eager
for
treasure
that
he
spoke
up
at
once
i
not
afraid
open
the
door
the
sorcerer
gave
a
jerk
and
the
door
flew
open
what
a
sight
there
in
the
faint
red
light
taffy
discerned
a
great
cave
lying
on
the
floor
were
hundreds
of
armed
men
but
motionless
and
apparently
sound
asleep
little
spangles
of
light
were
reflected
from
swords
spears
round
shields
and
burnished
helmets
all
these
seemed
of
very
ancient
pattern
but
immediately
in
front
of
them
was
a
bell
taffy
felt
some
curiosity
to
tap
it
would
the
sleeping
host
of
men
then
rise
up
just
then
the
sorcerer
speaking
with
a
menacing
gesture
and
in
a
harsh
tone
said
do
not
touch
that
bell
or
it
all
up
with
us
both
moving
carefully
so
as
not
to
trip
or
to
stumble
over
the
sleeping
soldiers
they
went
on
and
taffy
stopping
and
looking
up
beheld
before
him
a
great
round
table
many
warriors
were
sitting
at
it
their
splendid
gold
inlaid
armor
glittering
helmets
and
noble
faces
showed
that
they
were
no
common
men
yet
taffy
could
see
only
a
few
of
the
faces
for
all
had
their
heads
more
or
less
bent
down
as
if
sound
asleep
though
sword
and
spear
were
near
at
hand
ready
to
be
grasped
in
a
moment
outshining
all
was
a
golden
throne
at
the
farther
end
of
the
table
and
on
it
sat
a
king
he
was
of
imposing
stature
and
august
presence
upon
his
head
was
a
crown
on
which
were
inlaid
or
set
precious
stones
these
shone
by
their
own
light
sending
out
rays
so
brilliant
that
they
dazzled
taffy
who
had
never
seen
anything
like
them
the
king
held
in
his
right
hand
a
mighty
sword
it
had
a
history
and
the
name
of
it
was
excalibur
in
arthur
hand
it
was
almost
part
of
his
own
soul
its
hilt
and
handle
were
of
finely
chased
gold
richly
studded
with
gems
yet
his
head
too
was
bent
in
deep
sleep
as
if
only
thunder
could
wake
him
are
they
all
everyone
asleep
asked
taffy
each
and
all
was
the
answer
when
did
they
fall
asleep
asked
the
drover
over
a
thousand
years
ago
answered
the
sorcerer
tell
me
who
they
are
and
why
here
asked
taffy
they
are
king
arthur
trusty
warriors
they
are
waiting
for
the
hour
to
come
when
they
shall
rise
up
and
destroy
the
enemies
of
the
cymry
and
once
again
possess
the
whole
island
of
britain
as
in
the
early
ages
before
the
saxons
came
and
who
are
those
sitting
around
the
table
asked
taffy
the
sorcerer
seemed
tired
of
answering
questions
but
he
replied
giving
the
name
of
each
knight
and
also
that
of
his
father
as
if
he
were
a
welshman
himself
but
at
this
taffy
grew
impatient
feeling
as
if
a
book
of
genealogy
had
been
hurled
at
him
most
impolitely
he
interrupted
his
companion
and
cried
out
and
who
is
that
on
the
throne
the
sorcerer
looked
as
if
he
was
vexed
and
felt
insulted
but
he
answered
it
king
arthur
himself
with
excalibur
his
famous
sword
in
his
hand
this
was
snapped
out
as
if
the
sorcerer
was
disgusted
at
the
interruption
of
his
genealogy
and
he
shut
his
mouth
tight
as
if
he
would
answer
no
more
questions
for
such
an
impolite
fellow
seizing
taffy
by
the
hand
he
led
him
into
what
was
the
storehouse
of
the
cave
there
lay
heaps
upon
heaps
of
yellow
gold
both
men
stuffed
their
pockets
belt
bags
and
the
inside
of
their
clothes
with
all
they
could
load
in
now
we
had
better
get
out
for
it
is
time
to
go
said
the
sorcerer
and
he
led
the
way
towards
the
cave
door
but
as
taffy
passed
back
and
along
the
hall
where
the
host
of
warriors
were
sleeping
his
curiosity
got
the
better
of
him
he
said
to
himself
i
must
see
this
host
awake
i
touch
that
bell
and
find
out
whether
the
sorcerer
spoke
the
truth
so
when
he
came
to
it
he
struck
the
bell
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
thousands
of
warriors
sprang
up
seized
their
armor
girded
their
swords
or
seized
their
spears
all
seemed
eagerly
awaiting
the
command
to
rush
against
the
foe
the
ground
quaked
with
their
tramping
and
shook
with
their
tread
until
taffy
thought
the
cave
roof
would
fall
in
and
bury
them
all
the
air
resounded
with
the
rattle
of
arms
as
the
men
when
in
ranks
marked
time
ready
for
motion
forward
and
out
of
the
cave
but
from
the
midst
of
the
host
a
deep
sounding
voice
as
earnest
as
if
in
hot
temper
but
as
deliberate
as
if
in
caution
against
a
false
alarm
spoke
he
inquired
who
rang
that
bell
has
the
day
come
the
sorcerer
thoroughly
frightened
and
trembling
answered
no
the
day
has
not
come
sleep
on
taffy
though
dazzled
by
the
increasing
brilliancy
of
the
light
had
heard
another
deep
voice
more
commanding
in
its
tones
than
even
a
king
call
out
arthur
awake
the
bell
has
rung
the
day
is
breaking
awake
great
king
arthur
but
even
against
such
a
voice
that
of
the
sorcerer
now
scared
beyond
measure
lest
the
king
and
his
host
should
discover
the
cheat
and
with
his
sword
excalibur
chop
the
heads
off
both
taffy
and
himself
answered
no
it
is
still
night
sleep
on
arthur
the
great
erect
over
all
his
head
aloft
and
crowned
with
jewels
as
with
stars
the
king
himself
now
spoke
no
my
warriors
the
day
has
not
yet
come
when
the
black
eagle
and
the
golden
eagle
will
meet
in
war
sleep
on
loyal
souls
the
morning
of
wales
has
not
yet
dawned
then
like
the
gentle
soughing
of
the
evening
breeze
among
forest
trees
all
sound
died
away
and
in
the
snap
of
a
finger
all
were
asleep
again
seizing
the
hand
of
taffy
the
sorcerer
hurried
him
out
of
the
cave
moved
the
stone
back
in
its
place
and
motioning
to
taffy
to
do
the
same
he
quickly
shoveled
and
kicked
the
loose
dirt
in
the
hole
and
stamped
it
down
when
taffy
turned
to
look
for
him
he
was
gone
without
even
taking
the
trouble
to
call
his
dupe
a
fool
wearied
with
his
unwonted
labors
and
excitements
taffy
walked
home
got
his
supper
pondered
on
what
he
had
seen
slept
and
awoke
in
the
morning
refreshed
after
breakfast
he
sallied
out
again
with
pick
and
shovel
for
months
taffy
dug
over
every
square
foot
of
the
hill
neglecting
his
business
as
cattle
man
he
spent
all
the
money
he
had
made
in
london
but
he
never
found
that
entrance
to
the
cave
he
died
a
poor
man
and
all
his
children
had
to
work
hard
to
get
their
bread
xvii
the
lady
of
the
lake
one
easily
gets
acquainted
with
the
welsh
fairies
for
nearly
all
the
good
ones
are
very
fond
of
music
or
they
live
down
in
the
lakes
or
up
in
the
mountains
they
are
always
ready
to
help
kind
or
polite
people
who
treat
them
well
or
will
give
them
a
glass
of
milk
or
a
saucer
of
flummery
but
oh
what
tricks
and
mischief
they
do
play
on
mean
or
stingy
or
grumpy
folks
with
bad
tempers
they
tangle
up
the
harness
of
the
horses
milk
the
cows
letting
the
milk
go
to
waste
on
the
stable
floor
tie
knots
in
their
tails
or
keep
the
dog
mouth
shut
when
the
robbers
come
sneaking
around
better
not
offend
a
fairy
even
though
no
higher
than
a
thimble
a
favorite
place
for
the
elfin
ladies
of
the
lake
is
high
up
in
one
of
the
fresh
water
mountain
ponds
they
are
cousins
to
the
mermaids
that
swim
in
the
salt
water
they
say
that
these
lake
maidens
love
to
come
up
close
to
the
shore
to
smell
the
sweet
grass
and
flowers
which
the
cows
like
so
much
near
one
of
these
lakes
dwelt
a
widow
with
only
one
son
named
gwyn
one
day
he
took
his
lunch
of
barley
bread
and
cheese
and
went
out
as
usual
to
tend
the
cows
soon
he
saw
rising
out
of
the
water
to
dress
her
long
and
luxuriant
hair
the
most
beautiful
lady
he
had
ever
seen
in
her
hand
she
held
a
golden
comb
and
was
using
the
bright
as
a
mirror
at
once
gwyn
fell
in
love
with
her
and
like
an
unselfish
lad
held
out
his
refreshments
barley
bread
and
cheese
all
he
had
bidding
her
to
come
and
take
but
though
the
lady
glided
toward
him
while
he
still
held
out
his
hand
she
shook
her
head
saying
o
thou
of
the
hard
baked
bread
it
is
not
easy
to
catch
me
sorry
enough
to
miss
such
a
prize
he
hurried
home
to
tell
his
mother
she
wondering
also
whether
fairies
have
teeth
to
chew
told
him
to
take
soft
dough
next
time
then
perhaps
the
strange
lady
would
come
again
not
much
sleep
did
the
boy
get
that
night
and
before
the
sun
was
up
he
was
down
by
the
lake
side
holding
out
his
dough
there
hour
after
hour
neglecting
the
cows
he
looked
eagerly
over
the
water
but
nothing
appeared
except
ripples
started
by
the
breeze
again
and
again
he
gazed
in
hope
only
to
be
disappointed
illustration
in
a
moment
he
forgot
every
word
he
meant
to
say
meanwhile
he
thought
out
a
pretty
speech
to
make
to
her
but
he
kept
his
dough
and
went
hungry
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
trees
on
the
hills
were
casting
long
shadows
westward
that
he
gave
up
watching
for
he
supposed
she
would
come
no
more
but
just
as
he
started
to
go
back
to
his
mother
cabin
he
turned
his
head
and
there
was
the
same
lady
looking
more
beautiful
than
ever
in
a
moment
he
forgot
every
word
he
meant
to
say
to
her
his
tongue
seemed
to
leave
him
and
he
only
held
out
his
hand
with
the
dough
in
it
but
the
lake
lady
shaking
her
head
only
laughed
and
said
thou
of
the
soft
bread
i
will
not
have
thee
though
she
dived
under
the
water
and
left
him
sad
and
lonely
she
smiled
so
sweetly
as
she
vanished
that
though
again
disappointed
he
thought
she
would
come
again
and
she
might
yet
accept
his
gift
his
mother
told
him
to
try
her
with
bread
half
baked
that
is
midway
between
hard
crust
and
soft
dough
so
having
packed
his
lunch
and
much
excited
though
this
time
with
bright
hopes
gwyn
went
to
bed
though
not
to
sleep
at
dawn
he
was
up
again
and
out
by
the
lake
side
with
his
half
baked
bread
in
his
hand
it
was
a
day
of
rain
and
shine
of
sun
burst
and
cloud
but
no
lady
appeared
the
long
hours
of
watching
and
waiting
sped
on
until
it
was
nearly
dark
when
just
about
to
turn
homewards
to
ease
his
mother
anxiety
what
should
he
see
but
some
cows
walking
on
the
surface
of
the
water
in
a
few
minutes
the
lady
herself
lovelier
than
ever
rose
up
and
moved
towards
the
shore
gwyn
rushed
out
to
meet
her
with
beseeching
looks
and
holding
the
half
baked
bread
in
his
hand
this
time
she
graciously
took
the
gift
placed
her
other
hand
in
his
and
he
led
her
to
the
shore
standing
with
her
on
land
he
could
not
speak
for
many
seconds
he
noticed
that
she
had
sandals
on
her
feet
and
the
one
on
the
right
foot
was
tied
in
a
way
rather
unusual
under
her
winsome
smile
at
last
he
regained
the
use
of
his
tongue
then
he
burst
out
lady
i
love
you
more
than
all
the
world
besides
will
you
be
my
wife
she
did
not
seem
at
all
willing
at
first
but
love
begets
love
finally
yielding
to
his
pleadings
she
said
rather
solemnly
i
will
be
your
bride
but
only
on
this
condition
that
if
you
strike
me
three
times
without
cause
i
will
leave
your
house
and
you
only
will
be
to
blame
and
it
will
be
forever
these
words
stuck
in
his
mind
and
he
inwardly
made
a
vow
never
to
give
his
lovely
wife
cause
to
leave
him
but
not
yet
did
happiness
come
for
even
while
he
took
oath
that
he
would
rather
cut
off
his
right
hand
than
offend
her
she
darted
away
like
an
arrow
and
diving
in
the
lake
disappeared
at
this
sudden
blow
to
his
hopes
and
joy
gwyn
was
so
sorely
depressed
as
to
wish
to
take
his
own
life
rushing
up
to
the
top
of
a
rock
overhanging
the
deepest
part
of
the
lake
he
was
just
about
to
leap
into
the
water
and
drown
himself
when
he
heard
a
voice
behind
him
saying
hold
rash
lad
come
here
he
looked
and
there
down
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
stood
a
grand
looking
old
man
with
a
long
white
beard
on
either
side
of
him
was
a
lovely
maiden
these
were
his
daughters
trembling
with
fear
the
lad
slipped
down
from
the
rock
and
drew
near
then
the
old
man
spoke
comfortably
to
him
though
in
a
very
cracked
voice
mortal
do
you
wish
to
marry
one
of
my
daughters
show
me
the
one
you
love
more
than
the
other
and
i
will
consent
now
the
two
maidens
were
so
beautiful
yet
so
exactly
alike
that
gwyn
could
not
note
any
difference
as
he
looked
he
began
to
wonder
whether
it
had
been
a
different
lady
in
each
case
that
rose
out
of
the
water
he
looked
beyond
the
old
man
to
see
if
there
were
a
third
lady
when
he
saw
none
more
he
became
more
distracted
he
feared
lest
he
might
choose
the
wrong
one
who
had
not
promised
to
love
him
almost
in
despair
he
was
about
to
run
home
when
he
noticed
that
one
of
the
maidens
put
forward
her
right
foot
then
he
saw
that
her
sandal
was
tied
in
the
way
he
had
already
wondered
at
so
he
boldly
went
forward
and
took
her
by
the
hand
this
one
is
mine
said
he
to
the
father
you
are
right
answered
the
old
man
this
is
my
daughter
nelferch
take
her
and
you
shall
have
as
many
cattle
sheep
horses
hogs
and
goats
as
she
can
count
of
each
without
drawing
in
her
breath
but
i
warn
you
that
three
blows
without
cause
will
send
her
back
to
me
while
the
old
man
smiled
and
gwyn
renewed
his
vow
the
new
wife
began
to
count
by
fives
one
two
three
four
five
at
the
end
of
each
count
drawing
in
a
fresh
breath
there
rose
up
out
of
the
lake
as
many
sheep
cattle
goats
pigs
and
horses
as
she
had
counted
so
it
happened
that
the
lad
who
went
out
of
his
mother
cottage
in
the
morning
a
poor
boy
came
back
to
her
a
rich
man
and
leading
by
the
hand
the
loveliest
creature
on
whom
man
or
woman
had
ever
looked
upon
as
for
the
old
man
and
the
other
daughter
no
one
ever
saw
them
again
gwyn
and
his
wife
went
out
to
a
farm
which
he
bought
and
oh
how
happy
they
were
she
was
very
kind
to
the
poor
she
had
the
gift
of
healing
knew
all
the
herbs
which
were
good
for
medicine
and
cured
sick
folk
of
their
diseases
three
times
the
cradle
was
filled
and
each
time
with
a
baby
boy
eight
long
and
happy
years
followed
they
loved
each
other
so
dearly
and
were
so
happy
together
that
gwyn
vow
passed
entirely
out
of
his
mind
and
he
thought
no
more
of
it
on
the
seventh
birthday
of
the
oldest
boy
there
was
a
wedding
at
some
distance
away
and
the
father
and
mother
walked
through
a
field
where
their
horses
were
grazing
as
it
was
too
far
for
lady
nelferch
to
walk
all
the
way
her
husband
went
back
to
the
house
for
saddle
and
bridle
while
she
should
catch
the
horse
please
do
and
bring
me
my
gloves
from
off
the
table
she
called
as
he
turned
towards
the
house
but
when
he
returned
to
the
field
he
saw
that
she
had
not
stirred
so
before
handing
his
wife
her
gloves
and
pointing
playfully
to
the
horses
he
gave
her
a
little
flick
with
the
gloves
instead
of
moving
instantly
she
heaved
a
deep
sigh
then
looking
up
at
him
with
sorrowful
and
reproachful
eyes
she
said
remember
our
vow
gwyn
this
is
the
first
causeless
blow
may
there
never
be
another
days
and
years
passed
away
so
happily
that
the
husband
and
father
never
again
had
to
recall
the
promise
given
to
his
wife
and
her
father
but
when
they
were
invited
to
the
christening
of
a
baby
every
one
was
full
of
smiles
and
gayety
except
nelferch
women
especially
the
older
ones
often
cry
at
a
wedding
but
why
his
wife
should
burst
into
tears
puzzled
gwyn
tapping
her
on
the
shoulder
he
asked
the
reason
because
said
she
this
weak
babe
will
be
in
pain
and
misery
all
its
days
and
die
in
agony
and
husband
dear
you
have
once
again
struck
me
a
causeless
blow
oh
do
be
on
your
guard
and
not
again
break
your
promise
from
this
time
forth
gwyn
was
on
watch
over
himself
day
and
night
like
a
sentinel
over
whom
hangs
the
sentence
of
death
should
he
fall
asleep
on
duty
he
was
ever
vigilant
lest
he
in
a
moment
of
forgetfulness
might
by
some
slip
of
conduct
or
in
a
moment
of
forgetfulness
strike
his
dear
wife
the
baby
whose
life
of
pain
and
death
of
agony
nelferch
had
foretold
soon
passed
away
for
happily
its
life
was
short
then
she
and
her
husband
attended
the
last
rites
of
sorrow
for
celtic
folk
always
have
a
funeral
and
hold
a
wake
even
when
a
baby
only
a
span
long
lies
in
the
coffin
yet
in
the
most
solemn
moment
of
the
services
of
burial
nelferch
the
wife
laughed
out
so
long
and
with
such
merriment
that
everyone
was
startled
her
husband
mortified
at
such
improper
behavior
touched
her
gently
saying
hush
wife
why
do
you
laugh
because
the
babe
is
free
from
all
pain
and
you
have
thrice
struck
me
farewell
fleeing
like
a
deer
home
to
their
farm
she
called
together
by
its
name
each
and
every
one
of
their
animals
from
stable
and
field
yes
even
those
harnessed
to
the
plow
then
over
the
mountain
all
moved
in
procession
to
the
lake
there
they
plunged
in
and
vanished
no
trace
of
them
was
left
except
that
made
by
the
oxen
drawing
the
plow
and
which
mark
on
the
ground
men
still
point
out
broken
hearted
and
mad
with
grief
gwyn
rushed
into
the
lake
and
was
seen
no
more
the
three
sons
grieving
over
their
drowned
father
spent
their
many
days
wandering
along
the
lakeside
hoping
once
more
to
see
one
or
both
of
their
dear
parents
their
love
was
rewarded
they
never
saw
their
father
again
but
one
day
their
mother
nelferch
suddenly
appeared
out
of
the
water
telling
her
children
that
her
mission
on
earth
was
to
relieve
pain
and
misery
she
took
them
to
a
point
in
the
lake
where
many
plants
grew
that
were
useful
in
medicine
there
she
often
came
and
taught
them
the
virtues
of
the
roots
leaves
juices
and
the
various
virtues
of
the
herbs
and
how
to
nurse
the
sick
and
heal
those
who
had
diseases
all
three
of
nelferch
sons
became
physicians
of
fame
and
power
their
descendants
during
many
centuries
were
renowned
for
their
skill
in
easing
pain
and
saving
life
to
this
day
physicians
point
is
shown
to
visitors
as
a
famous
spot
and
in
tradition
is
almost
holy
xviii
the
king
foot
holder
there
was
a
curious
custom
in
the
far
olden
times
of
wales
at
the
banqueting
hall
the
king
of
the
country
would
sit
with
his
feet
in
the
lap
of
a
high
officer
whenever
his
majesty
sat
down
to
dinner
this
official
person
would
be
under
the
table
holding
the
royal
feet
this
was
also
the
case
while
all
sat
around
the
evening
fire
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
this
footholding
person
was
one
of
the
king
staff
and
every
castle
must
have
a
human
footstool
as
part
of
its
furniture
by
and
by
it
became
the
fashion
for
pretty
maidens
to
seek
this
task
or
to
be
chosen
for
the
office
their
names
in
english
sounded
like
orthopede
or
foot
lights
when
she
was
a
plump
and
petite
maid
they
nicknamed
her
twelve
inches
or
when
unusually
soothing
in
her
caresses
of
the
soft
royal
toes
it
was
considered
a
high
honor
to
be
the
king
foot
holder
in
after
centuries
it
was
often
boasted
of
that
such
and
such
an
ancestor
had
held
this
honorable
service
one
picture
of
castle
life
as
given
in
one
of
the
old
books
tells
how
kaim
the
king
officer
went
to
the
mead
cellar
with
a
golden
cup
to
get
a
drink
that
would
keep
them
all
wide
awake
he
also
brought
a
handful
of
skewers
on
which
they
were
to
broil
the
collops
or
bits
of
meat
at
the
fire
while
they
were
doing
this
the
king
sat
on
a
seat
of
green
rushes
over
which
was
spread
a
satin
cover
with
a
cushion
like
it
for
his
elbow
to
rest
upon
in
the
evening
the
harpers
and
singers
made
music
the
bards
recited
poetry
or
the
good
story
tellers
told
tales
of
heroes
and
wonders
during
all
this
time
one
or
more
maidens
held
the
king
feet
or
took
turns
at
it
when
tired
for
often
the
revels
or
songs
and
tales
lasted
far
into
the
night
at
intervals
if
the
story
was
dull
or
he
had
either
too
much
dinner
or
had
been
out
hunting
and
got
tired
his
majesty
took
a
nap
with
his
feet
resting
upon
the
lap
of
a
pretty
maiden
this
happened
often
in
the
late
hours
while
they
were
getting
the
liquid
refreshments
ready
then
the
king
chamberlain
gently
nudged
him
to
be
wideawake
and
he
again
enjoyed
the
music
and
the
stories
while
his
feet
were
held
for
altogether
it
was
great
fun
now
there
was
once
a
prince
of
gwynedd
in
wales
named
math
who
was
so
fond
of
having
his
feet
held
that
he
neglected
to
govern
his
people
properly
he
spent
all
his
time
lounging
in
an
easy
chair
while
a
pretty
maiden
held
his
heels
and
toes
he
committed
all
public
cares
to
two
of
his
nephews
these
were
named
for
short
gily
and
gwyd
the
one
whom
the
king
loved
best
to
have
her
hold
his
feet
was
the
fairest
maiden
in
all
the
land
and
she
was
named
goewen
by
and
by
the
prince
grew
so
fond
of
having
his
feet
held
and
stroked
and
patted
and
played
with
by
goewen
that
he
declared
that
he
could
not
live
unless
goewen
held
his
feet
and
she
said
that
if
she
did
not
hold
the
king
feet
she
would
die
now
this
gily
one
of
the
king
nephews
son
of
don
whom
he
had
appointed
to
look
day
by
day
after
public
affairs
would
often
be
in
the
hall
at
night
he
listened
to
the
music
and
stories
and
seeing
goewen
the
king
foot
holder
he
fell
in
love
with
her
his
eye
usually
wandered
from
the
story
teller
to
the
lovely
girl
holding
the
king
feet
and
he
thought
her
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
soon
he
became
so
lovesick
that
he
felt
he
would
risk
or
give
his
life
to
get
and
have
her
for
his
own
but
what
would
the
king
say
besides
he
soon
found
out
that
the
maiden
goewen
cared
nothing
for
him
nevertheless
the
passion
of
the
youth
burned
hotly
and
kept
increasing
he
confided
his
secret
to
his
brother
gwyd
and
asked
his
aid
which
was
promised
so
one
day
the
brother
went
to
king
math
and
begged
for
leave
to
go
to
pryderi
in
the
king
name
he
would
ask
from
him
the
gift
of
a
herd
of
swine
of
famous
breed
which
in
the
quality
of
the
pork
they
furnished
excelled
all
other
pigs
known
they
were
finer
than
any
seen
in
the
land
or
ever
heard
of
before
their
flesh
was
said
to
be
sweeter
juicier
and
more
tender
than
the
best
beef
even
their
manners
were
better
than
those
of
some
men
in
fact
these
famous
pigs
were
a
present
from
the
king
of
fairyland
so
highly
were
they
prized
that
king
math
doubted
much
whether
his
nephew
could
get
them
at
any
price
in
ancient
wales
the
bards
and
poet
singers
were
welcomed
and
trusted
above
all
men
and
this
whether
in
the
palace
or
the
cottage
so
gwyd
the
brother
of
the
one
in
order
to
get
the
herd
of
surpassing
swine
took
ten
companions
all
young
men
and
strong
dressed
as
bards
and
pretending
by
their
actions
to
be
such
then
they
all
started
out
together
to
seek
the
palace
of
pryderi
having
arrived
they
were
entertained
at
a
great
feast
in
the
castle
hall
there
pryderi
sat
on
his
with
his
feet
in
a
maiden
lap
the
dinner
over
gwyd
was
asked
to
tell
a
story
this
he
did
delighting
everyone
so
much
that
he
was
voted
a
jolly
good
fellow
by
all
in
fact
pryderi
felt
ready
to
give
him
anything
he
might
demand
excepting
always
his
foot
holder
at
once
gwyd
made
request
to
give
him
the
herd
of
swine
at
this
the
countenance
of
pryderi
fell
for
he
had
made
a
promise
to
his
people
that
he
would
not
sell
or
give
away
the
swine
until
they
had
produced
double
their
number
in
the
land
for
there
were
no
pigs
and
no
pork
like
theirs
to
be
bought
anywhere
now
this
gwyd
was
not
very
cunning
but
he
had
the
power
of
using
magic
arts
by
these
he
could
draw
the
veil
of
illusion
over
both
the
mind
and
the
eyes
of
the
people
so
he
made
answer
to
pryderi
objections
thus
keep
your
promise
to
your
people
oh
most
honored
pryderi
and
only
exchange
them
for
the
gift
i
make
thee
said
gwyd
thereupon
exerting
his
powers
of
magic
he
created
the
illusion
of
twelve
superb
horses
these
were
all
saddled
bridled
and
magnificently
caparisoned
but
after
hours
they
would
vanish
from
sight
the
illusion
would
be
over
with
these
steeds
so
well
fitted
for
hunting
were
twelve
sleek
fleet
hounds
taken
altogether
here
was
a
sight
to
make
a
eyes
dance
with
delight
so
pryderi
gave
gwyd
the
swine
and
he
quickly
drove
them
off
for
he
whispered
to
his
companion
fellows
in
knavery
the
illusion
will
only
last
until
the
same
hour
and
so
it
happened
for
when
pryderi
men
went
to
the
stables
to
groom
the
horses
and
feed
the
hounds
there
was
nothing
in
either
the
stables
or
the
kennels
when
they
told
this
to
pryderi
he
at
once
blew
his
horn
and
assembled
his
knights
to
invade
the
country
of
gwynedd
to
recover
his
swine
hearing
of
his
coming
king
math
went
out
to
meet
pryderi
in
battle
but
while
he
was
away
with
his
army
gily
the
lover
seized
the
beautiful
maiden
goewen
who
held
the
king
feet
in
her
lap
she
was
not
willing
to
marry
gily
but
he
eloped
with
her
and
carried
her
off
to
his
cottage
the
war
which
now
raged
was
finally
decided
by
single
combat
as
was
the
custom
in
old
days
by
this
the
burning
of
the
peasants
houses
and
the
ruin
which
threatened
the
whole
country
ended
and
peace
came
it
was
not
alone
by
the
strength
and
fierceness
of
king
math
but
also
by
the
magic
spells
of
gwyd
that
pryderi
was
slain
after
burying
the
hero
king
math
came
back
to
his
palace
and
found
out
what
gily
had
done
then
he
took
goewen
away
from
gily
and
to
make
amends
for
her
trouble
in
being
thus
torn
from
his
palace
king
math
made
her
his
queen
then
the
lovely
goewen
shared
his
throne
covered
with
the
flame
colored
satin
one
of
the
most
beautiful
maidens
of
the
court
was
chosen
to
hold
his
feet
until
such
time
as
a
permanent
choice
was
made
as
for
the
two
nephews
who
had
fled
from
the
wrath
of
their
princely
uncle
they
were
put
under
bans
as
outlaws
and
had
to
live
on
the
borders
of
the
kingdoms
no
one
of
the
king
people
was
allowed
to
give
them
food
or
drink
yet
they
would
not
obey
the
summons
of
the
king
to
come
and
receive
their
punishment
but
at
last
tired
of
being
deserted
by
all
good
men
and
women
they
repented
in
sorrow
hungry
ragged
and
forlorn
they
came
to
their
uncle
the
king
to
submit
themselves
to
be
punished
when
they
appeared
math
spoke
roughly
to
them
and
said
you
can
not
make
amends
for
the
shame
you
have
brought
upon
me
yet
since
you
obey
and
are
sorry
i
shall
punish
you
for
a
time
and
then
pardon
you
you
are
to
do
penance
for
three
years
at
least
then
they
were
changed
into
wild
deer
and
he
told
them
to
come
back
after
twelve
months
at
the
end
of
the
year
they
returned
bringing
with
them
a
young
fawn
as
this
creature
was
entirely
innocent
it
was
given
a
human
form
and
baptized
in
the
church
but
the
two
brothers
were
changed
into
wild
swine
and
driven
off
to
find
their
food
in
the
forest
at
the
end
of
the
year
they
came
back
with
a
young
pig
the
king
had
the
little
animal
changed
into
a
human
being
which
like
every
mother
child
in
that
time
received
baptism
again
the
brothers
were
transformed
into
animal
shape
this
time
as
wolves
and
were
driven
out
to
the
hills
at
the
end
of
a
twelve
months
period
they
came
back
three
in
number
for
one
was
a
cub
by
this
time
the
penance
of
the
naughty
nephews
was
over
and
they
were
now
to
be
delivered
from
all
magic
spells
so
their
human
nature
was
restored
to
them
but
they
must
be
washed
thoroughly
in
the
first
place
it
took
much
hot
water
and
lye
made
from
the
wood
ashes
and
then
a
great
deal
of
scrubbing
to
make
them
presentable
then
they
were
anointed
with
sweet
smelling
oil
and
the
king
ordered
them
to
be
arrayed
in
elegant
apparel
they
were
appointed
to
hold
honorable
office
at
court
and
from
time
to
time
to
go
out
through
the
country
to
call
the
officers
to
attend
to
public
business
when
the
time
came
that
the
king
sought
for
one
of
the
most
beautiful
maidens
who
should
hold
his
feet
gwyd
nominated
to
the
notice
his
sister
arianrod
the
king
was
gracious
and
thereafter
she
held
his
feet
at
all
the
banquets
she
was
looked
up
to
with
reverence
by
all
and
held
the
office
for
many
years
thus
king
reputation
for
grace
and
mercy
was
confirmed
xix
powell
prince
of
dyfed
one
of
the
oldest
of
the
welsh
fairy
tales
tells
us
about
pwyle
king
of
fairyland
and
father
of
the
numerous
clan
of
the
powells
he
was
a
mighty
hunter
he
could
ride
a
horse
draw
a
bow
and
speak
the
truth
he
was
always
honored
by
men
and
he
kept
his
faith
and
his
promises
to
women
the
children
loved
him
for
he
loved
them
in
the
castle
hall
he
could
tell
the
best
stories
no
man
bard
or
warrior
foot
holder
or
commoner
could
excel
him
in
gaining
and
keeping
the
attention
of
his
hearers
even
when
they
were
sleepy
and
wanted
to
go
to
bed
one
day
when
out
a
hunting
in
the
woods
he
noticed
a
pack
of
hounds
running
down
a
stag
he
saw
at
once
that
they
were
not
his
own
for
they
were
snow
white
in
color
and
had
red
ears
being
a
young
man
powell
did
not
know
at
this
time
of
his
life
that
red
is
the
fairy
color
and
that
these
were
all
dogs
from
fairyland
so
he
drove
off
the
hounds
and
was
about
to
let
loose
his
own
pack
on
the
stag
when
a
horseman
appeared
on
the
scene
the
stranger
at
once
began
to
upbraid
powell
for
being
impolite
he
asked
why
his
hounds
should
not
be
allowed
to
hunt
the
deer
powell
spoke
pleasantly
in
reply
making
his
proper
excuses
to
the
horseman
the
two
began
to
like
each
other
and
soon
got
acquainted
and
mutually
enjoyed
being
companions
it
turned
out
that
the
stranger
was
arawn
a
king
in
fairyland
he
had
a
rival
named
hargan
who
was
beating
him
and
his
army
in
war
so
arawn
asked
powell
to
help
him
against
his
enemy
he
even
made
request
that
one
year
from
that
time
powell
should
meet
hargan
in
battle
he
told
him
that
one
stroke
of
his
sword
would
finish
the
enemy
he
must
then
sheathe
his
weapon
and
not
on
any
account
strike
a
second
time
to
make
victory
sure
the
fairy
king
would
exchange
shapes
with
the
mortal
ruler
and
each
take
not
only
the
place
but
each
the
shape
and
form
of
the
other
powell
must
go
into
fairy
land
and
govern
the
kingdom
there
while
arawn
should
take
charge
of
affairs
at
dyfed
but
powell
was
warned
again
to
smite
down
his
enemy
with
a
single
stroke
of
his
sword
if
in
the
heat
of
the
conflict
and
the
joy
of
victory
powell
should
forget
and
give
a
second
blow
to
hargan
he
would
immediately
come
to
life
and
be
as
strong
as
ever
powell
heeded
well
these
words
then
putting
on
the
shape
of
arawn
he
went
into
fairy
land
and
no
one
noticed
or
thought
of
anything
different
from
the
days
and
years
gone
by
but
now
at
night
a
new
and
unexpected
difficulty
arose
beautiful
wife
was
evidently
not
in
the
secret
for
she
greeted
powell
as
her
own
husband
after
dinner
when
the
telling
of
stories
in
the
banqueting
hall
was
over
the
time
had
come
for
them
to
retire
but
the
new
bed
fellow
did
not
even
kiss
her
or
say
good
night
but
turned
his
back
to
her
and
his
face
to
the
wall
and
never
moved
until
daylight
then
the
new
king
in
fairy
land
rose
up
ate
his
breakfast
and
went
out
to
hunt
every
day
he
ruled
the
castle
and
kingdom
as
if
he
had
always
been
the
monarch
to
everybody
he
seemed
as
if
he
had
been
long
used
to
public
business
and
no
questions
were
asked
nor
was
there
any
talk
made
on
the
subject
everyone
took
things
as
matter
of
course
yet
however
polite
or
gracious
he
might
be
to
the
queen
during
the
day
in
the
evening
he
spoke
not
a
word
and
passed
every
night
as
at
the
first
the
twelve
months
soon
sped
along
and
now
the
time
for
the
battle
in
single
combat
between
powell
and
hargan
had
fully
come
the
two
warriors
met
in
the
middle
of
a
river
ford
and
backed
their
horses
for
a
charge
then
they
rushed
furiously
at
the
other
powell
spear
struck
hargan
so
hard
that
he
was
knocked
out
of
the
saddle
and
hurled
the
length
of
a
lance
over
and
beyond
the
crupper
or
tail
strap
of
his
horse
he
fell
mortally
wounded
upon
the
ground
now
came
the
moment
of
danger
and
temptation
to
powell
for
hargan
cried
out
for
the
love
of
heaven
finish
your
work
on
me
slay
me
with
your
sword
but
powell
was
wise
and
his
head
was
cool
he
had
kept
in
mind
the
warning
to
strike
only
one
blow
he
called
out
loudly
so
that
all
could
hear
him
i
will
not
repeat
that
slay
thee
who
may
i
shall
not
so
hargan
knowing
his
end
had
come
bade
his
nobles
bear
him
away
from
the
river
shore
then
powell
with
his
armies
overran
the
two
kingdoms
of
fairy
land
and
made
himself
master
of
all
he
took
oath
of
all
the
princes
and
nobles
who
swore
to
be
loyal
to
their
new
master
this
done
powell
rode
away
to
the
trysting
place
in
a
glen
and
there
he
met
arawn
as
had
been
appointed
they
changed
shapes
and
each
became
himself
as
he
had
been
before
arawn
thanked
powell
heartily
and
bade
him
see
what
he
had
done
for
him
then
each
one
rode
back
in
his
former
likeness
to
his
kingdom
now
at
anwyn
no
one
but
arawn
himself
knew
that
anything
unusual
had
taken
place
after
dinner
and
the
evening
story
telling
were
over
and
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
arawn
wife
was
surprised
in
double
measure
two
things
puzzled
her
her
husband
was
now
very
tender
to
her
and
also
very
talkative
whereas
for
a
whole
year
every
night
he
had
been
as
silent
and
immovable
as
a
log
how
could
it
be
in
either
case
but
this
time
the
wife
was
silent
as
a
statue
even
though
arawn
spoke
to
her
three
times
he
received
no
reply
then
he
asked
directly
of
her
why
she
was
so
silent
she
made
an
answer
that
for
a
whole
year
no
word
had
been
spoken
in
their
bedroom
what
said
he
did
we
not
talk
together
as
always
before
no
said
she
not
for
a
year
has
there
been
talk
or
caress
between
us
at
this
answer
arawn
was
overcome
with
surprise
and
as
struck
with
admiration
at
having
so
good
a
friend
he
burst
out
first
in
praise
of
powell
and
then
told
his
wife
all
that
had
happened
during
the
past
twelve
months
she
too
was
full
of
admiration
and
told
her
husband
that
in
powell
he
had
certainly
found
a
true
friend
in
dyfed
when
powell
had
returned
to
his
own
land
and
castle
he
called
his
lords
together
then
he
asked
them
to
be
perfectly
frank
and
free
to
speak
they
must
tell
him
whether
they
thought
him
a
good
king
during
the
year
past
all
shouted
in
chorus
of
approval
then
their
spokesman
addressed
powell
thus
my
lord
never
was
thy
wisdom
so
great
thy
generosity
more
free
nor
thy
justice
more
manifest
than
during
the
past
year
when
he
ceased
all
the
vassals
showed
their
approval
of
this
speech
then
powell
smiling
told
the
story
of
his
adventures
in
exchanging
his
form
and
tasks
at
the
end
of
which
the
spokesman
taking
his
cue
from
the
happy
faces
of
all
his
fellow
vassals
made
reply
of
a
truth
lord
we
pray
thee
do
thou
give
thanks
to
heaven
that
thou
hast
formed
such
a
fellowship
please
continue
to
us
the
form
of
the
kingdom
and
rule
that
we
have
enjoyed
for
a
year
past
thereupon
king
powell
took
oath
kissing
the
hilt
of
his
sword
and
called
on
heaven
to
witness
his
promise
that
he
would
do
as
they
had
desired
so
the
two
kings
confirmed
the
friendship
they
had
made
each
sent
the
other
rich
gifts
of
jewels
horses
and
hounds
in
memory
of
so
wonderful
and
happy
union
of
a
mortal
and
a
fairy
powell
was
thereafter
in
addition
to
all
his
titles
saluted
as
lord
of
anwyn
which
is
only
another
name
for
the
land
of
the
fairies
xx
powell
and
his
bride
not
far
from
the
castle
where
king
powell
had
his
court
there
was
a
hillock
called
the
mount
of
macbeth
it
was
the
common
belief
that
some
strange
adventure
would
befall
anyone
who
should
sit
upon
that
mound
he
would
receive
blows
or
wounds
or
else
he
would
see
something
wonderful
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
none
but
peaceful
bards
had
ever
sat
upon
the
mound
never
a
warrior
or
a
common
man
had
risked
sitting
there
the
general
fear
felt
and
the
awe
inspired
by
the
place
was
too
great
but
after
his
adventure
of
being
king
of
fairy
land
for
a
whole
year
everything
else
to
powell
seemed
dull
and
commonplace
so
to
test
his
own
courage
and
worthiness
of
kingship
powell
assembled
all
his
lords
at
narberth
after
the
night
feasting
revelry
and
story
telling
powell
declared
that
next
day
he
would
sit
upon
the
enchanted
mound
so
when
the
sun
was
fully
risen
powell
took
his
seat
upon
the
mound
expecting
that
all
of
a
sudden
something
unusual
would
happen
for
some
minutes
nothing
whether
event
or
vision
took
place
then
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
saw
approaching
him
a
white
horse
on
which
rode
a
lady
she
was
dressed
in
shining
garments
as
if
made
of
gold
evidently
she
was
a
princess
yet
she
came
not
very
near
does
anyone
among
you
know
who
this
lady
is
asked
powell
of
his
chieftains
not
one
of
us
was
the
answer
thereupon
powell
ordered
his
vassals
to
ride
forward
they
were
to
greet
her
courteously
and
inquire
who
she
was
but
now
the
predicted
wonder
took
place
she
moved
away
from
them
yet
at
a
quiet
pace
that
suited
her
though
the
knights
spurred
their
horses
and
rode
fast
and
furiously
they
could
not
come
any
nearer
to
her
they
galloped
back
and
reported
their
failure
to
reach
the
lady
then
powell
picked
out
others
and
sent
them
riding
after
the
lady
but
each
time
one
and
all
returned
chagrined
with
failure
a
woman
had
beaten
them
so
the
day
closed
with
silence
in
the
castle
hall
there
was
no
merry
making
or
story
telling
that
night
the
next
day
powell
sat
again
on
the
mound
and
once
more
the
golden
lady
came
near
this
time
powell
himself
left
his
seat
on
the
mound
leaped
on
his
fleetest
horse
and
pursued
the
maiden
robed
in
gold
on
the
white
horse
but
she
flitted
away
as
she
had
done
before
from
the
knights
again
and
again
though
he
could
get
nearer
and
nearer
to
her
he
failed
then
the
baffled
king
cried
out
in
despair
o
maiden
fair
for
the
sake
of
him
whom
thou
lovest
stay
for
me
evidently
the
lady
who
lived
in
the
time
of
castles
and
courts
did
not
care
to
be
wooed
in
the
style
of
the
cave
men
such
manners
did
not
suit
her
but
with
a
change
of
method
of
making
love
her
heart
melted
besides
she
was
a
kind
woman
she
took
pity
on
horses
as
well
as
on
men
sweet
was
her
voice
as
she
answered
most
graciously
i
will
stay
gladly
and
it
were
better
for
thy
horses
hadst
thou
asked
me
properly
long
ago
to
his
questions
as
to
how
and
why
she
came
to
him
she
told
her
story
as
follows
i
am
rhiannon
descended
from
the
august
and
venerable
one
of
old
my
aunts
and
uncles
tried
to
make
me
marry
against
my
will
a
chieftain
named
gwawl
an
youth
son
of
clud
but
because
of
my
love
to
thee
would
i
have
no
husband
and
if
you
reject
me
i
will
never
marry
any
man
as
heaven
is
my
witness
were
i
to
choose
among
all
the
damsels
and
ladies
of
the
world
thee
would
i
choose
cried
powell
after
that
it
was
agreed
that
when
a
year
had
sped
powell
should
go
to
the
palace
of
the
august
and
venerable
one
of
old
and
claim
her
for
his
bride
so
when
twelve
months
had
passed
powell
with
his
retinue
of
a
hundred
knights
all
splendidly
horsed
and
finely
appareled
presented
himself
before
the
castle
there
he
found
his
fair
lady
and
a
feast
already
prepared
at
which
he
sat
with
her
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
were
her
father
and
mother
in
the
midst
of
this
joyous
occasion
when
all
was
gayety
and
they
talked
together
in
strode
a
youth
clad
in
sheeny
satin
he
was
of
noble
bearing
and
had
auburn
hair
he
saluted
powell
and
his
knights
courteously
at
once
powell
the
lord
of
narberth
invited
the
stranger
to
come
and
sit
down
as
guest
beside
him
not
so
replied
the
youth
i
am
a
suitor
and
have
come
to
crave
a
boon
of
thee
without
guile
or
suspicion
powell
replied
innocently
ask
what
you
will
if
in
my
power
it
shall
be
yours
but
rhiannon
chided
powell
she
asked
oh
why
did
you
give
him
such
an
answer
but
he
did
give
it
cried
the
auburn
haired
youth
then
turning
to
the
whole
company
of
nobles
he
appealed
to
them
did
he
not
pledge
his
word
before
you
all
to
give
me
what
i
asked
then
turning
to
powell
he
said
the
boon
i
ask
is
this
to
have
thy
bride
rhiannon
further
i
want
this
feast
and
banquet
to
celebrate
in
this
place
our
wedding
at
this
demand
powell
seemed
to
have
been
struck
dumb
he
did
not
speak
but
rhiannon
did
be
silent
as
long
as
thou
wilt
she
cried
but
surely
no
man
ever
made
worse
use
of
his
wits
than
thou
hast
done
for
this
man
to
whom
thou
gavest
thy
oath
of
promise
is
none
other
than
gwawl
the
son
of
clud
he
is
the
suitor
from
whom
i
fled
to
come
to
you
while
you
sat
on
the
narberth
mound
now
out
of
such
trouble
how
should
the
maiden
promised
to
two
men
be
delivered
her
wit
saved
her
for
the
nonce
powell
was
bound
to
keep
his
word
but
rhiannon
explained
to
gwawl
that
it
was
not
his
castle
or
hall
so
he
could
not
give
the
banquet
but
in
a
year
from
that
date
if
gwawl
would
come
for
her
she
would
be
his
bride
then
a
new
bridal
feast
would
be
set
for
the
wedding
in
the
meantime
rhiannon
planned
with
powell
to
get
out
of
the
trouble
for
this
purpose
she
gave
him
a
magical
bag
which
he
was
to
use
when
the
right
time
should
come
quickly
the
twelve
months
passed
and
then
gwawl
appeared
again
to
claim
his
bride
and
a
great
feast
was
spread
in
his
honor
all
were
having
a
good
time
when
in
the
midst
of
their
merriment
a
beggar
appeared
in
the
hall
he
was
in
rags
and
carried
the
usual
beggar
wallet
for
food
or
alms
he
asked
only
that
out
of
the
abundance
on
the
table
his
bag
might
be
filled
gwawl
agreed
and
ordered
his
servants
to
attend
to
the
matter
but
the
bag
never
got
full
what
they
put
into
it
or
how
much
made
no
difference
dish
after
dish
was
emptied
by
degrees
most
of
the
food
on
the
table
was
in
the
beggar
bag
my
soul
alive
will
that
bag
never
get
full
asked
gwawl
no
by
heaven
not
unless
some
rich
man
shall
get
into
it
stamp
it
down
with
his
feet
and
call
out
then
rhiannon
who
sat
beside
gwawl
urged
him
to
attempt
the
task
by
putting
his
two
feet
in
the
bag
to
stamp
it
down
no
sooner
had
gwawl
done
this
than
the
supposed
beggar
pushed
him
down
inside
the
bag
then
drawing
the
mouth
shut
he
tied
it
tight
over
gwawl
head
then
the
beggar
rags
dropped
and
there
stood
forth
the
handsome
leader
powell
he
blew
his
horn
and
in
rushed
his
knights
who
overcame
and
bound
the
followers
of
gwawl
then
they
proceeded
to
play
a
merry
game
of
football
using
the
bag
in
which
gwawl
was
tied
as
men
in
our
day
kick
pigskin
one
called
to
his
mate
or
rival
what
in
the
bag
and
others
answered
a
badger
so
they
played
the
game
of
badger
in
the
bag
kicking
it
around
the
hall
they
did
not
let
the
prisoner
out
of
the
bag
until
he
had
promised
to
pay
the
pipers
the
harpers
and
the
singers
who
should
come
to
the
wedding
of
powell
and
rhiannon
he
must
give
up
all
his
claims
and
register
a
vow
never
to
take
revenge
this
oath
given
and
promises
made
the
bag
was
opened
and
the
agreements
solemnly
confirmed
in
presence
of
all
then
gwawl
and
every
one
of
his
men
knights
and
servants
were
let
go
and
they
went
back
to
their
own
country
a
few
evenings
later
in
the
large
banqueting
hall
powell
and
rhiannon
were
married
besides
the
great
feast
presents
were
given
to
all
present
high
and
low
then
the
happy
pair
made
their
wedding
journey
to
gwawl
palace
at
narberth
there
the
lovely
bride
gave
a
ring
or
a
gem
to
every
lord
and
lady
in
her
new
realm
and
everybody
was
happy
xxi
why
the
back
door
was
front
in
the
days
when
were
no
books
or
writing
and
folk
tales
were
the
only
ones
told
there
was
an
old
woman
who
had
a
bad
reputation
she
pretended
to
be
very
poor
so
as
not
to
attract
or
tempt
robbers
yet
those
who
knew
her
best
knew
also
as
a
subject
of
common
talk
that
she
was
always
counting
out
her
coins
besides
this
she
lived
in
a
nice
house
and
it
was
believed
that
she
made
a
living
by
stealing
babies
out
of
their
cradles
to
sell
to
the
bad
fairies
it
was
matter
of
rumor
that
she
would
for
an
extra
large
sum
take
a
wicked
fairy
ugly
brat
and
put
it
in
place
of
a
mother
darling
in
addition
to
these
horrid
charges
against
her
it
was
rumored
that
she
laid
a
spell
or
charm
on
the
cattle
of
people
whom
she
did
not
like
in
order
to
take
revenge
on
them
the
old
woman
denied
all
this
and
declared
it
was
only
silly
gossip
of
envious
people
who
wanted
her
money
she
lived
so
comfortably
she
averred
because
her
son
who
was
a
stone
mason
who
made
much
money
by
building
chimneys
which
had
then
first
come
into
fashion
when
he
brought
to
her
the
profits
of
his
jobs
she
counted
the
coins
and
because
of
this
some
people
were
jealous
and
told
bad
stories
about
her
she
declared
she
was
thrifty
but
neither
a
miser
nor
a
kidnaper
nor
a
witch
one
day
this
old
woman
wanted
more
feathers
to
stuff
into
her
bed
to
make
it
softer
and
feel
pleasanter
for
her
old
bones
to
rest
upon
for
what
she
slept
on
was
nearly
worn
through
so
she
went
to
a
farm
where
they
were
plucking
geese
and
asked
for
a
few
handfuls
of
feathers
but
the
rich
farmer
people
refused
and
ordered
her
out
of
the
farm
yard
shortly
after
this
event
the
cows
of
this
farmer
who
was
opposed
to
chimneys
and
did
not
like
her
or
her
son
suffered
dreadfully
from
the
disease
called
the
black
quarter
as
they
had
no
horse
doctors
or
professors
of
animal
economy
or
veterinaries
in
those
days
many
of
the
cows
died
the
rich
farmer
lost
much
money
for
he
had
now
no
milk
or
beef
to
sell
at
once
he
suspected
that
his
cattle
were
bewitched
and
that
the
old
woman
had
cast
a
spell
on
them
in
those
days
it
was
very
easy
to
think
so
so
the
angry
man
went
one
day
to
the
old
crone
when
she
was
alone
and
her
stout
son
was
away
on
a
distant
job
he
told
her
to
remove
the
charm
which
she
had
laid
on
his
beasts
or
he
would
tie
her
arms
and
legs
together
and
pitch
her
into
the
river
the
old
woman
denied
vehemently
that
she
possessed
any
such
powers
or
had
ever
practiced
such
black
arts
to
make
sure
of
it
the
farmer
made
her
say
out
loud
the
blessing
of
god
be
upon
your
cattle
to
clinch
the
matter
he
compelled
her
to
repeat
the
lord
prayer
which
she
was
able
to
do
without
missing
one
syllable
she
used
the
form
of
words
which
are
not
found
in
the
prayer
book
but
are
in
the
bible
and
was
very
earnest
when
she
prayed
forgive
us
our
debts
as
we
forgive
our
debtors
but
after
all
that
trouble
and
the
rough
way
which
the
rich
farmer
took
to
save
his
cattle
his
efforts
were
in
vain
in
spite
of
that
kind
of
religion
which
he
professed
which
was
shown
by
bullying
a
poor
old
woman
his
cattle
were
still
sick
with
no
sign
of
improvement
he
was
at
his
wits
end
to
know
what
to
do
next
now
as
we
have
said
this
was
about
the
time
that
chimneys
came
into
fashion
in
very
old
days
the
cymric
house
was
a
round
hut
with
a
thatched
roof
without
glass
windows
and
the
smoke
got
out
through
the
door
and
holes
in
the
walls
in
the
best
way
it
could
the
only
tapestry
in
the
hut
was
in
the
shape
of
long
festoons
of
soot
that
hung
from
the
roof
or
rafters
these
when
the
wind
blew
or
the
fire
was
lively
would
swing
or
dance
or
whirl
and
often
fall
on
the
heads
or
into
the
food
while
the
folks
were
eating
when
the
children
cried
or
made
wry
faces
at
the
black
stuff
their
daddy
only
laughed
and
said
it
was
healthy
or
was
for
good
luck
but
by
and
by
the
carpenters
and
masons
made
much
improvement
especially
when
instead
of
flint
hatchets
they
had
iron
axes
and
tools
then
they
hewed
down
trees
that
had
thick
cross
branches
and
set
up
columns
in
the
center
and
made
timber
walls
and
rafters
then
the
house
was
square
or
oblong
in
other
words
the
cymric
folks
squared
the
circle
now
they
began
to
have
lattices
and
much
later
even
glass
windows
they
removed
the
fireplace
from
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
set
it
at
the
end
of
the
house
opposite
the
door
and
built
chimneys
then
they
set
the
beds
at
the
side
and
made
sleeping
rooms
this
was
done
by
stretching
curtains
between
partitions
they
had
also
a
loft
in
which
to
keep
odds
and
ends
they
hung
up
the
bacon
and
hams
and
strings
of
onions
and
made
a
mantle
piece
over
the
fireplace
they
even
began
to
decorate
the
walls
with
pictures
and
to
set
pewter
dishes
china
cats
and
dresden
shepherds
in
rows
on
the
shelves
for
ornaments
now
people
wore
shoes
and
the
floor
instead
of
being
muddy
or
dusty
with
pools
and
puddles
of
water
in
the
time
of
rainy
weather
and
with
the
pigs
and
chickens
running
in
and
out
was
of
clay
beaten
down
flat
and
hard
and
neatly
whitewashed
at
the
edges
outside
in
front
were
laid
nice
flat
flagstones
that
made
a
pleasant
path
to
the
front
door
flowers
inside
and
out
added
to
the
beauty
of
the
home
and
made
perfume
for
those
who
loved
them
the
rich
farmer
had
just
left
his
old
round
hut
and
now
lived
in
one
of
the
new
and
better
kind
of
houses
he
was
very
proud
of
his
chimney
which
he
had
built
higher
than
any
of
his
neighbors
but
he
could
not
be
happy
while
so
many
of
his
cows
were
sick
or
dying
besides
he
was
envious
of
other
people
prosperity
and
cared
nothing
when
they
too
suffered
one
night
while
he
was
standing
in
front
of
his
fine
house
and
wondering
why
he
must
be
vexed
with
so
many
troubles
he
talked
to
himself
and
speaking
out
loud
said
why
do
my
cows
get
well
i
tell
you
said
a
voice
behind
him
it
seemed
half
way
between
a
squeak
and
a
growl
he
turned
round
and
there
he
saw
a
little
angry
man
he
was
dressed
in
red
and
stood
hardly
as
high
as
the
farmer
knee
the
little
old
man
glared
at
the
big
fellow
and
cried
out
in
a
high
tone
of
voice
you
must
change
your
habits
of
disposing
of
your
garbage
for
other
people
have
chimneys
besides
you
what
has
that
to
do
with
sickness
among
my
cows
much
indeed
your
family
is
the
cause
of
your
troubles
for
they
throw
all
their
slops
down
my
chimney
and
put
out
my
fire
the
farmer
was
puzzled
beyond
the
telling
for
he
owned
all
the
land
within
a
mile
and
knew
of
no
house
in
sight
put
your
foot
on
mine
and
then
you
will
have
the
power
of
vision
to
see
clearly
the
farmer
big
boot
was
at
once
placed
on
the
little
man
slipper
and
when
he
looked
down
he
almost
laughed
at
the
contrast
in
size
what
was
his
real
surprise
when
he
saw
that
the
slops
thrown
out
of
his
house
did
actually
fall
down
and
besides
the
contents
of
the
full
bucket
when
emptied
kept
on
dripping
into
the
chimney
of
a
house
which
stood
far
below
but
which
he
had
never
seen
before
but
as
soon
as
he
took
his
foot
off
that
of
the
tiny
little
man
he
saw
nothing
everything
like
a
building
vanished
as
in
a
dream
i
see
that
my
family
have
done
wrong
and
injured
yours
pray
forgive
me
i
do
what
i
can
to
make
amends
for
it
it
no
matter
now
if
you
only
do
as
i
ask
you
shut
up
your
front
door
build
a
wall
in
its
place
and
then
my
family
will
not
suffer
from
yours
the
rich
farmer
thought
all
this
was
very
funny
and
he
had
a
hearty
laugh
over
it
all
yet
he
did
exactly
as
the
little
man
in
the
red
cloak
had
so
politely
asked
him
he
walled
up
the
old
door
at
the
front
and
built
another
at
the
back
of
the
house
which
opened
out
into
the
garden
then
he
made
the
path
on
which
to
go
in
from
the
roadway
to
the
threshold
around
the
corners
and
over
a
longer
line
of
flagstones
then
he
removed
the
fireplace
and
chimney
to
what
had
been
the
front
side
of
the
house
but
was
now
the
back
for
the
next
thing
he
had
a
copper
doorsill
nailed
down
which
his
housemaid
polished
until
it
shone
as
bright
as
gold
yet
long
before
this
his
cows
had
got
well
and
they
now
gave
more
and
richer
milk
than
ever
he
became
the
wealthiest
man
in
the
district
his
children
all
grew
up
to
be
fine
looking
men
and
women
his
grandsons
were
famous
engineers
and
introduced
paving
and
drainage
in
the
towns
so
that
for
both
man
and
beast
wales
is
one
of
the
healthiest
of
countries
xxii
the
red
bandits
of
montgomery
when
chimneys
were
first
added
to
houses
in
wales
and
the
style
of
changed
from
round
to
square
many
old
people
found
fault
with
the
new
fashion
of
letting
the
smoke
out
they
declared
they
caught
colds
and
sneezed
oftener
than
in
the
times
gone
by
the
chimneys
they
said
cost
too
much
money
and
were
useless
extravagances
they
got
along
well
enough
in
the
good
old
days
when
the
smoke
had
its
own
way
of
getting
out
then
it
took
plenty
of
time
to
pass
through
the
doors
and
windholes
for
no
one
person
or
thing
was
in
a
hurry
when
they
were
young
moreover
when
the
fireplace
was
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
the
whole
family
sat
around
it
and
had
a
sociable
time
it
was
true
as
they
confessed
when
argued
with
that
the
smell
of
the
cooking
used
to
linger
too
long
the
soot
also
hung
in
long
streamers
from
the
rafters
and
stuck
to
the
house
like
old
friends
but
the
greatest
and
most
practical
objection
of
the
old
folks
to
the
chimneys
was
that
robbers
used
them
to
climb
down
at
night
and
steal
people
money
when
they
were
asleep
so
many
householders
used
to
set
old
scythe
blades
across
the
new
smoke
holes
to
keep
out
the
thieves
or
to
slice
them
up
if
they
persisted
in
montgomery
which
is
one
of
the
welsh
shires
there
was
an
epidemic
of
robbery
and
the
doings
of
the
red
bandits
are
famous
in
history
now
there
was
a
young
widow
whose
husband
had
been
killed
by
the
footpads
or
road
robbers
she
was
left
alone
in
the
world
with
a
little
boy
baby
in
the
cradle
and
only
one
cow
in
the
byre
she
had
hard
work
to
pay
her
rent
but
as
there
were
three
or
four
scythes
set
in
the
chimney
and
the
cow
stable
had
a
good
lock
on
it
she
thought
she
was
safe
from
burglars
or
common
thieves
but
the
reds
picked
out
the
most
expert
in
their
gang
and
he
one
night
slipped
down
into
the
widow
cottage
without
making
any
noise
or
cutting
off
his
nose
toes
or
fingers
then
robbing
the
widow
of
her
rent
money
he
picked
the
lock
of
the
byre
and
drove
off
the
cow
in
the
morning
the
poor
woman
found
both
doors
open
but
there
was
no
money
and
no
cow
while
she
was
crying
over
her
loss
and
wringing
her
hands
because
of
her
poverty
she
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
come
in
said
the
widow
there
entered
an
old
lady
with
a
kindly
face
she
was
very
tall
and
well
dressed
her
cloak
her
gloves
and
shoes
and
the
ruffles
under
her
high
peaked
welsh
head
dress
were
all
green
the
widow
thought
she
looked
like
an
animated
leek
in
her
right
hand
was
a
long
staff
and
in
her
left
under
her
cloak
she
held
a
little
bag
that
was
green
also
why
do
you
weep
asked
the
visitor
then
the
widow
told
her
tale
of
woe
the
story
of
the
loss
of
her
husband
and
how
a
red
robber
in
spite
of
the
scythe
blades
set
in
the
chimney
had
come
down
and
taken
away
both
her
money
and
her
cow
now
although
she
had
sold
all
her
butter
and
cream
she
could
neither
pay
her
rent
nor
have
any
buttermilk
with
her
rye
bread
and
flummery
dry
your
tears
and
take
comfort
said
the
tall
lady
in
the
green
peaked
hat
here
is
money
enough
to
pay
your
rent
and
buy
another
cow
with
that
she
sat
down
at
the
round
table
near
the
peat
fire
opening
her
bag
the
shining
gold
coins
slid
out
and
formed
a
little
heap
on
the
table
there
you
can
have
all
this
if
you
will
give
me
all
i
want
at
first
the
widow
eyes
opened
wide
and
then
she
glanced
at
the
cradle
where
her
baby
was
sleeping
then
she
wondered
though
she
said
nothing
but
the
next
moment
she
was
laughing
at
herself
and
looking
around
at
her
poor
cottage
she
tried
to
guess
what
there
was
in
it
that
the
old
lady
could
possibly
want
you
can
have
anything
i
have
name
it
she
said
cheerfully
to
her
visitor
but
only
a
moment
more
and
all
her
fears
returned
at
the
thought
that
the
visitor
might
ask
for
her
boy
the
old
lady
spoke
again
and
said
i
want
to
help
you
all
i
can
but
what
i
came
here
for
is
to
get
the
little
boy
in
the
cradle
the
widow
now
saw
that
the
old
woman
was
a
fairy
and
that
if
her
visitor
got
hold
of
her
son
she
would
never
see
her
child
again
so
she
begged
piteously
of
the
old
lady
to
take
anything
and
everything
except
her
one
child
no
i
want
that
boy
and
if
you
want
the
gold
you
must
let
me
take
him
is
there
anything
else
that
i
can
do
for
you
so
that
i
may
get
the
money
asked
the
widow
well
i
make
it
easier
for
you
there
are
two
things
i
must
tell
you
to
cheer
you
what
are
they
asked
the
widow
eagerly
one
is
that
by
our
fairy
law
i
can
not
take
your
boy
until
three
days
have
passed
then
i
shall
come
again
and
you
shall
have
the
gold
but
only
on
the
one
condition
i
have
stated
and
the
next
almost
gasped
the
widow
if
you
can
guess
my
name
you
will
doubly
win
for
then
i
shall
give
you
the
gold
and
you
can
keep
your
boy
without
waiting
for
another
word
the
lady
in
green
scooped
up
her
money
put
it
back
in
the
bag
and
moved
off
and
out
the
door
the
poor
woman
at
once
a
widow
and
mother
and
now
stripped
of
her
property
fearing
to
lose
her
boy
brooded
all
night
over
her
troubles
and
never
slept
a
wink
in
the
morning
she
rose
up
left
her
baby
with
a
neighbor
and
went
to
visit
some
relatives
in
the
next
village
which
was
several
miles
distant
she
told
her
story
but
her
kinsfolk
were
too
poor
to
help
her
so
all
disconsolate
she
turned
her
face
homewards
on
her
way
back
she
had
to
pass
through
the
woods
where
on
one
side
was
a
clearing
in
the
middle
of
this
open
space
was
a
ring
of
grass
in
the
ring
a
little
fairy
lady
was
tripping
around
and
singing
to
herself
creeping
up
silently
the
anxious
mother
heard
to
her
joy
a
rhymed
couplet
and
caught
the
sound
of
a
name
several
times
repeated
it
sounded
like
silly
doot
hurrying
home
and
perfectly
sure
that
she
knew
the
secret
that
would
save
her
boy
she
set
cheerily
about
her
regular
work
and
daily
tasks
in
fact
she
slept
soundly
that
night
next
day
in
came
the
lady
in
green
as
before
with
her
bag
of
money
taking
her
seat
at
the
round
table
near
the
fire
she
poured
out
the
gold
then
jingling
the
coins
in
the
pile
she
said
now
give
up
your
boy
or
guess
my
name
if
you
want
me
to
help
you
the
young
widow
feeling
sure
that
she
had
the
old
fairy
in
a
trap
thought
she
would
have
some
fun
first
how
many
guesses
am
i
allowed
she
asked
all
you
want
and
as
many
as
you
please
answered
the
green
lady
smiling
the
widow
rattled
off
a
string
of
names
english
welsh
and
biblical
but
every
time
the
fairy
shook
her
head
her
eyes
began
to
gleam
as
if
she
felt
certain
of
getting
the
boy
she
even
moved
her
chair
around
to
the
side
nearest
the
cradle
one
more
guess
cried
the
widow
can
it
be
silly
doot
at
this
sound
the
fairy
turned
red
with
rage
at
the
same
moment
the
door
opened
wide
and
a
blast
of
wind
made
the
hearth
fire
flare
up
leaving
her
gold
behind
her
the
old
woman
flew
up
the
chimney
and
disappeared
over
the
housetops
the
widow
scooped
up
the
gold
bought
two
cows
furnished
her
cottage
with
new
chairs
and
fresh
flowers
and
put
the
rest
of
the
coins
away
under
one
of
the
flag
stones
at
the
hearth
when
her
boy
grew
up
she
gave
him
a
good
education
and
he
became
one
of
the
fearless
judges
who
with
the
aid
of
baron
owen
rooted
out
of
their
lair
the
red
bandits
that
had
robbed
his

since

the
fairy
congress
one
can
hardly
think
of
wales
without
a
harp
the
music
of
this
most
ancient
and
honorable
instrument
which
emits
sweet
sounds
when
heard
in
a
foreign
land
makes
welsh
folks
homesick
for
the
old
country
and
the
music
of
the
harp
its
strings
can
wail
with
woe
ripple
with
merriment
sound
out
the
notes
of
war
and
peace
and
lift
the
soul
in
heavenly
melody
usually
a
player
on
the
harp
opened
the
eistedfodd
as
the
welsh
literary
congress
is
called
but
this
time
they
had
engaged
for
the
fairies
a
funny
little
fellow
to
start
the
programme
with
a
solo
on
his
violin
the
figure
of
this
musician
at
the
congress
of
welsh
fairies
was
the
most
comical
of
any
in
the
company
the
saying
that
he
was
popular
with
all
the
mountain
spirits
was
shown
to
be
true
the
moment
he
began
to
scrape
his
fiddle
for
then
they
all
crowded
around
him
did
you
ever
see
such
a
tiny
specimen
asked
queen
mab
of
puck
the
little
fiddler
came
forward
and
drawing
his
instrument
from
under
his
arm
proceeded
to
scrape
the
strings
he
had
on
a
pair
of
moss
trousers
and
his
coat
was
a
yellow
gorse
flower
his
feet
were
clad
in
shoes
made
of
beetles
wings
which
always
kept
bright
as
if
polished
with
a
brush
when
one
looked
at
the
fiddle
he
could
see
that
it
was
only
a
wooden
spoon
with
strings
across
the
bowl
but
the
moment
he
drew
the
bow
from
one
side
to
the
other
all
the
elves
from
every
part
of
the
hills
came
tripping
along
to
hear
the
music
and
at
once
began
dancing
some
of
these
elves
were
dressed
in
pink
some
in
blue
others
in
yellow
and
many
had
glow
worms
in
their
hands
their
tread
was
so
light
that
the
flower
stems
never
bent
nor
was
a
petal
crushed
when
they
walked
over
the
turf
all
as
they
came
near
bowed
or
dropped
a
curtsey
then
the
little
musician
took
off
his
cap
to
each
and
bowed
in
return
there
was
too
much
business
before
the
meeting
for
dancing
to
be
kept
up
very
long
but
when
the
violin
solo
was
over
at
a
sign
given
by
the
fiddler
the
dancers
took
seats
wherever
they
could
find
them
on
the
grass
or
gorse
or
heather
or
on
the
stones
after
order
had
been
secured
the
chairman
of
the
meeting
read
regrets
from
those
who
had
been
invited
but
could
not
be
present
the
first
note
was
from
the
mermaids
who
lived
near
the
green
isles
of
the
ocean
they
asked
to
be
excused
from
traveling
inland
and
climbing
rocks
in
the
present
delicate
state
of
their
health
this
would
be
too
fatiguing
poor
things
it
was
unanimously
voted
that
they
be
excused
queen
mab
was
dressed
as
befitted
the
occasion
like
a
welsh
lady
not
wearing
a
crown
but
a
high
peaked
hat
pointed
at
the
top
and
about
half
a
yard
high
it
was
black
and
was
held
on
by
fastenings
of
scalloped
lace
that
came
down
around
her
neck
the
lake
fairies
or
elfin
maids
were
out
in
full
force
these
lived
at
the
bottom
of
the
many
ponds
and
pools
in
wales
many
stories
are
told
of
the
wonderful
things
they
did
with
boats
and
cattle
nowadays
when
they
milk
cows
by
electric
machinery
and
use
steam
launches
on
the
water
most
of
the
water
sprites
of
all
kinds
have
been
driven
away
for
they
do
not
like
the
smell
of
kerosene
or
gasoline
it
is
for
these
reasons
that
in
our
day
they
are
not
often
seen
in
fact
cows
from
the
creameries
can
wade
out
into
the
water
and
even
stand
in
it
while
lashing
their
tails
to
keep
off
the
flies
without
any
danger
as
in
old
times
of
being
pulled
down
by
the
elfin
maids
the
little
red
men
that
could
hide
under
a
thimble
and
have
plenty
of
room
to
spare
were
all
out
the
elves
and
nixies
and
sprites
of
all
colors
and
many
forms
were
on
hand
the
pigmies
who
guard
the
palace
of
the
king
of
the
world
underground
came
in
their
gay
dresses
there
were
three
of
them
and
they
brought
in
their
hands
balls
of
gold
with
which
to
play
tenpins
but
they
were
not
allowed
to
have
any
games
while
the
meeting
was
going
on
in
fact
just
when
these
little
fellows
from
down
under
the
earth
were
showing
off
their
gay
clothes
and
their
treasures
from
the
caves
one
mischievous
fairy
maid
sidled
up
to
their
chief
and
whispered
in
his
ear
better
put
away
your
gold
for
this
is
in
modern
wales
where
they
have
pawn
shops
three
golden
balls
two
above
the
one
below
which
you
often
see
nowadays
mean
that
two
to
one
you
will
never
get
it
again
these
hang
out
as
the
sign
of
a
pawnbroker
shop
and
what
you
put
in
does
not
as
a
rule
come
out
i
am
afraid
that
some
of
the
cymric
fairies
from
cornwall
or
montgomery
or
cheshire
might
think
you
were
after
business
and
you
understand
that
no
advertising
is
allowed
here
in
a
moment
each
of
the
three
leaders
thrust
his
ball
into
his
bosom
it
made
his
coat
bulge
out
and
at
this
some
of
the
fairies
wondered
but
all
they
thought
of
was
that
this
spoiled
a
handsome
figure
or
was
it
some
new
idea
to
tell
the
truth
they
were
vexed
at
not
keeping
up
with
the
new
fashions
for
they
knew
nothing
of
this
latest
fad
among
such
fine
young
gallants
much
of
the
chat
and
gossip
before
and
after
the
meeting
was
between
the
fairies
who
live
in
the
air
or
on
mountains
and
those
down
in
the
earth
or
deep
in
the
sea
they
swapped
news
gossip
and
scandal
at
a
great
rate
there
were
a
dozen
or
two
creatures
who
had
high
brows
who
said
they
were
this
did
not
mean
that
these
fairies
had
ever
been
through
college
certainly
the
college
never
went
through
them
said
one
very
homely
fairy
who
was
spiteful
and
jealous
the
simple
fact
was
that
the
one
they
called
betty
the
and
others
from
that
welsh
village
called
bryn
mawr
and
another
from
flint
and
another
from
yale
and
still
others
from
brimbo
and
from
poeth
had
come
from
places
so
named
and
down
on
the
map
of
wales
though
they
were
no
real
girls
there
that
could
talk
french
or
english
or
read
latin
in
fact
simply
meant
that
they
were
from
the
woods
and
lived
among
the
trees
for
in
welsh
means
a
forest
the
fairy
police
were
further
instructed
not
to
admit
and
if
such
were
found
to
put
out
the
following
bad
characters
for
this
was
a
perfectly
respectable
meeting
these
naughty
folks
were
the
old
hag
of
the
mist
the
invisible
hag
that
moans
dolefully
in
the
night
the
tolaeth
a
creature
never
seen
but
that
groans
sings
saws
or
stamps
noisily
the
dogs
of
the
sky
all
witches
of
every
sort
and
kind
all
peddlers
of
horseshoes
crosses
charms
or
amulets
all
mortals
with
brains
fuddled
by
liquor
all
who
had
on
shoes
which
water
would
not
run
under
all
fairies
that
were
accustomed
to
turn
mortals
into
cheese
every
one
of
these
who
might
want
to
get
in
were
to
be
refused
admittance
another
circle
of
rather
exclusive
fairies
who
always
kept
away
from
the
blacksmiths
hardware
stores
smelting
furnaces
and
mines
had
formed
an
society
these
were
a
kind
of
a
welsh
four
hundred
or
élite
who
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
anyone
who
had
an
iron
tool
or
weapon
or
ornament
in
his
hand
or
on
his
dress
or
who
used
iron
in
any
form
or
for
any
use
they
frowned
upon
the
idea
of
cymric
land
becoming
rich
by
mining
and
smelting
and
selling
iron
they
did
not
even
approve
of
the
idea
that
any
imps
and
dwarfs
of
the
iron
mines
should
be
admitted
to
the
meeting
one
clique
of
fairies
that
looked
like
elves
were
in
bad
humor
almost
to
moping
when
one
of
these
got
up
to
speak
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
never
sit
down
he
tired
all
the
lively
fairies
by
reminiscences
of
druids
and
mistletoes
and
by
telling
every
one
how
much
better
the
old
times
were
than
the
present
president
puck
who
always
liked
things
short
and
was
himself
as
lively
as
quicksilver
many
times
called
these
fellows
to
order
but
they
kept
meandering
on
until
daybreak
when
it
was
time
to
adjourn
lest
the
sunshine
should
spoil
them
all
and
change
them
into
slate
or
stone
it
was
hard
to
tell
just
how
much
business
was
disposed
of
at
this
session
or
whether
one
ever
came
to
the
point
although
there
was
a
great
deal
of
oratory
and
music
much
of
what
was
said
was
in
poetry
or
in
verses
or
rhymes
of
three
lines
each
what
they
talked
about
was
mainly
in
protest
against
the
smoke
of
factories
and
collieries
and
because
there
was
so
much
soot
and
so
little
soap
in
the
land
but
what
did
they
do
at
the
fairy
congress
the
truth
is
that
nobody
knows
what
was
done
in
this
session
of
the
fairies
for
the
proceedings
were
kept
secret
the
only
one
who
knows
was
an
old
welshman
whom
the
used
to
meet
once
in
a
while
he
is
the
one
mortal
who
knows
anything
about
this
meeting
and
he
wo
tell
or
at
least
he
wo
talk
in
anything
but
welsh
so
we
have
to
find
out
the
gist
of
the
matter
by
noticing
in
the
stories
which
we
have
just
read
what
the
fairies
did
xxiv
the
sword
of
avalon
many
of
the
welsh
tales
are
about
fighting
and
wars
and
no
country
as
small
as
wales
has
so
many
castles
yet
these
are
nearly
all
in
ruins
and
children
play
in
them
this
is
because
men
got
tired
of
battles
and
sieges
everybody
knows
that
after
king
arthur
knights
had
punched
and
speared
whacked
and
chopped
at
each
other
with
axe
and
sword
long
enough
had
slain
dragons
and
tamed
monsters
and
rescued
princesses
from
cruel
uncles
and
good
men
from
dark
dungeons
even
the
plain
people
such
as
farmers
and
mechanics
had
enough
and
wanted
no
more
besides
this
they
wished
to
be
treated
more
like
human
beings
and
not
have
to
work
so
hard
and
also
to
keep
their
money
when
they
earned
it
even
king
arthur
himself
towards
the
end
of
this
era
saw
that
fashions
were
changing
and
that
he
must
change
with
them
hardware
was
too
high
in
price
and
was
no
longer
needed
for
clothing
he
was
wise
enough
to
see
that
battle
axes
maces
swords
lances
and
armor
had
better
be
put
to
some
better
use
when
iron
was
getting
scarce
and
wool
and
linen
were
cheaper
even
the
stupid
normans
learned
that
decency
and
kindness
cost
less
and
accomplished
more
in
making
the
welshery
loyal
subjects
of
the
king
so
when
after
many
battles
king
arthur
went
out
to
have
a
little
war
of
his
own
and
to
enjoy
the
fight
in
which
he
was
mortally
wounded
he
showed
his
greatness
even
in
the
hour
of
death
in
truth
it
is
given
to
some
men
like
samson
to
be
even
mightier
when
they
die
than
when
following
the
strenuous
life
so
it
was
with
this
great
and
good
man
of
cymry
his
love
for
his
people
never
ceased
for
one
moment
and
in
his
dying
hour
he
left
a
bequest
that
all
his
people
have
understood
and
acted
upon
thus
it
has
come
to
pass
that
the
welsh
have
been
really
unconquerable
by
saxon
or
norman
or
even
in
these
twentieth
century
days
by
teutons
though
living
in
a
small
country
they
are
among
the
greatest
in
the
world
not
in
force
or
in
material
things
but
in
soul
when
belgium
was
invaded
they
not
only
stood
up
in
battle
against
the
invader
but
they
welcomed
to
their
homes
tens
of
thousands
of
fugitives
and
fed
and
sheltered
them
brave
as
lions
their
path
of
progress
has
been
in
faithfulness
to
duty
industry
and
patience
and
along
the
paths
of
poetry
music
and
brotherhood
their
motto
for
ages
has
been
truth
against
the
world
now
the
manner
of
king
arthur
taking
off
and
his
immortal
legacy
was
on
this
fashion
after
doing
a
great
many
wonderful
things
in
many
countries
king
arthur
came
back
to
punish
the
wicked
man
modred
in
the
battle
that
ensued
he
received
wounds
that
made
him
feel
that
he
was
very
soon
to
die
so
he
ordered
his
loyal
vassal
to
take
his
sword
to
the
island
of
avalon
there
he
must
cast
the
weapon
into
the
deep
water
but
the
sword
was
part
of
the
soul
of
arthur
it
would
not
sink
out
of
sight
until
it
had
given
a
message
from
their
king
to
the
welsh
for
all
time
after
it
had
been
thrown
in
the
water
it
disappeared
but
rose
again
first
the
shining
blade
and
then
the
hilt
and
then
a
hand
was
seen
to
rise
out
of
the
flood
thrice
that
hand
waved
the
sword
round
and
round
this
was
the
prophecy
of
the
deathless
from
the
dead
king
body
might
be
hid
in
a
cave
or
molder
in
the
ground
but
his
soul
was
to
live
and
cheer
his
people
his
beloved
cymric
nation
with
their
undying
language
were
to
rise
in
power
again
and
the
resurrection
has
been
glorious
not
by
the
might
of
the
soldier
or
by
arms
or
war
though
the
welsh
never
flinch
from
duty
or
before
the
foe
but
by
the
power
of
poet
singer
and
the
narrator
of
stories
that
touch
the
imagination
and
fire
the
soul
to
noble
deeds
have
these
results
come
arthur
good
blade
thus
waved
above
the
waters
became
a
veritable
sword
of
the
spirit
men
of
genius
arose
to
flush
with
color
the
old
legends
prophets
preachers
monks
missionaries
carried
these
all
over
europe
and
made
them
the
vehicles
of
christian
doctrine
in
their
new
forms
they
fired
the
imagination
and
illuminated
as
with
ten
thousand
lamps
many
lands
and
nations
until
they
held
every
people
in
spell
in
miracle
and
morality
play
they
reappeared
in
beauty
they
attuned
the
harp
and
instrument
of
the
musician
and
the
troubadour
and
these
sang
the
gospel
in
all
lands
north
and
south
while
telling
the
stories
of
adam
and
of
abraham
of
bethlehem
and
of
the
cross
of
the
holy
grail
and
of
arthur
and
his
knights
all
the
precious
lore
of
the
celtic
race
became
transfigured
to
illustrate
and
enforce
christian
truth
the
symbolical
bowl
the
celtic
caldron
of
abundance
became
the
cup
of
the
eucharist
and
the
grail
the
symbol
of
blessings
eternal
by
the
artists
in
the
stained
glass
and
in
windows
of
the
great
churches
which
were
built
no
longer
of
wood
but
of
stone
that
blossomed
under
the
chisel
the
old
legends
were
by
the
new
currents
of
truth
given
a
mystic
glow
as
wonderful
as
the
rise
of
gothic
architecture
and
the
upbuilding
of
cathedrals
as
glorious
as
the
light
and
art
that
beautify
the
great
temples
of
worship
was
this
of
the
arthurian
legends
for
now
again
the
old
virtues
of
the
knightly
days
loyalty
obedience
redress
of
wrongs
reverence
of
womanhood
and
the
application
of
christian
ethics
to
the
old
rude
rules
of
decency
lifted
the
life
of
the
common
people
to
a
nobler
plane
and
ushered
in
the
modern
days
then
after
seven
hundred
years
a
host
of
singers
tennyson
leading
them
all
attuned
the
old
celtic
harp
they
reset
for
us
the
cymric
melody
and
colorful
incidents
in
the
light
that
never
was
on
sea
or
land
the
old
days
live
again
in
a
greater
glory
lady
guest
put
the
mabinogion
into
english
and
renan
and
arnold
and
rolleston
and
rhys
in
prose
competed
