preface
the
institution
of
human
slavery
as
it
existed
in
this
country
has
long
been
dead
and
happily
for
all
the
sacred
interests
which
it
assailed
there
is
for
it
no
resurrection
it
may
therefore
be
asked
to
what
purpose
is
the
story
which
follows
of
the
experiences
of
one
person
under
that
dead
and
accursed
institution
to
such
question
if
it
be
asked
it
may
be
answered
that
the
narrator
presents
his
story
in
compliance
with
the
suggestion
of
friends
and
in
the
hope
that
it
may
add
something
of
accurate
information
regarding
the
character
and
influence
of
an
institution
which
for
two
hundred
years
dominated
the
country
exercising
a
potent
but
baneful
influence
in
the
formation
of
its
social
civil
and
industrial
structures
and
which
finally
plunged
it
into
the
most
stupendous
civil
war
which
the
world
has
ever
known
as
the
enlightenment
of
each
generation
depends
upon
the
thoughtful
study
of
the
history
of
those
that
have
gone
before
everything
which
tends
to
fullness
and
accuracy
in
that
history
is
of
value
even
though
it
be
not
presented

chapter
i
life
on
a
cotton
plantation
birth
sold
in
a
richmond
slave
pen
i
was
born
in
virginia
in
near
charlottesville
in
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
rivanna
river
my
father
was
a
white
man
and
my
mother
a
negress
the
slave
of
one
john
martin
i
was
a
mere
child
probably
not
more
than
six
years
of
age
as
i
remember
when
my
mother
two
brothers
and
myself
were
sold
to
louis
a
practicing
physician
in
the
village
of
scottsville
we
remained
with
him
about
five
years
when
he
died
and
in
the
settlement
of
his
estate
i
was
sold
to
one
washington
fitzpatrick
a
merchant
of
the
village
he
kept
me
a
short
time
when
he
took
me
to
richmond
by
way
of
expecting
to
sell
me
but
as
the
market
was
dull
he
brought
me
back
and
kept
me
some
three
months
longer
when
he
told
me
he
had
hired
me
out
to
work
on
a
running
to
richmond
and
to
go
to
my
mother
and
get
my
clothes
ready
to
start
on
the
trip
i
went
to
her
as
directed
and
when
she
had
made
ready
my
bundle
she
bade
me
with
tears
in
her
eyes
saying
my
son
be
a
good
boy
be
polite
to
every
one
and
always
behave
yourself
properly
it
was
sad
to
her
to
part
with
me
though
she
did
not
know
that
she
was
never
to
see
me
again
for
my
master
had
said
nothing
to
her
regarding
his
purpose
and
she
only
thought
as
i
did
that
i
was
hired
to
work
on
the
and
that
she
should
see
me
occasionally
but
alas
we
never
met
again
i
can
see
her
form
still
as
when
she
bade
me
that
parting
i
can
never
forget
i
ran
off
from
her
as
quickly
as
i
could
after
her
parting
words
for
i
did
not
want
her
to
see
me
crying
i
went
to
my
master
at
the
store
and
he
again
told
me
that
he
had
hired
me
to
work
on
the
and
to
go
aboard
immediately
of
the
boat
and
the
trip
and
the
scenes
along
the
route
i
remember
little
i
only
thought
of
my
mother
and
my
leaving
her
when
we
arrived
at
richmond
george
pullan
a
as
he
was
called
came
to
the
boat
and
began
to
question
me
asking
me
first
if
i
could
remember
having
had
the
chickenpox
measles
or
i
answered
yes
then
he
asked
me
if
i
did
not
want
to
take
a
little
walk
with
him
i
said
no
well
said
he
you
have
got
to
go
your
master
sent
you
down
here
to
be
sold
and
told
me
to
come
and
get
you
and
take
you
to
the
trader
yard
ready
to
be
sold
i
saw
that
to
hesitate
was
useless
so
i
at
once
obeyed
him
and
went
a
slave
market
the
trader
establishment
consisted
of
an
office
a
large
and
a
yard
in
the
rear
enclosed
with
a
wall
of
brick
fifteen
feet
high
the
principal
men
of
the
establishment
were
the
proprietor
and
the
foreman
when
slaves
were
to
be
exhibited
for
sale
the
foreman
was
called
to
the
office
by
means
of
a
bell
and
an
order
given
him
to
bring
into
the
all
the
slaves
in
the
establishment
this
was
the
work
of
but
a
few
minutes
and
the
women
were
placed
in
a
row
on
one
side
of
the
room
and
the
men
on
the
other
persons
desirous
of
purchasing
them
passed
up
and
down
between
the
lines
looking
the
poor
creatures
over
and
questioning
them
in
about
the
following
manner
what
can
you
do
are
you
a
good
cook
seamstress
dairymaid
this
to
the
women
while
the
men
would
be
questioned
as
to
their
line
of
work
can
you
plow
are
you
a
blacksmith
have
you
ever
cared
for
horses
can
you
pick
cotton
rapidly
sometimes
the
slave
would
be
required
to
open
his
mouth
that
the
purchaser
might
examine
the
teeth
and
form
some
opinion
as
to
his
age
and
physical
soundness
and
if
it
was
suspected
that
a
slave
had
been
beaten
a
good
deal
he
would
be
required
to
step
into
another
room
and
undress
if
the
person
desiring
to
buy
found
the
slave
badly
scarred
by
the
common
usage
of
whipping
he
would
say
at
once
to
the
foreman
why
this
slave
is
not
worth
much
he
is
all
scarred
up
no
i
want
him
bring
me
in
another
to
look
at
slaves
without
scars
from
whipping
and
looking
well
physically
always
sold
readily
they
were
never
left
long
in
the
yard
it
was
expected
that
all
the
slaves
in
the
yard
for
sale
would
be
neatly
dressed
and
clean
before
being
brought
into
the
it
was
the
foreman
business
to
see
that
each
one
was
presentable
slave
whipping
as
a
business
whipping
was
done
at
these
markets
or
trader
yards
all
the
time
people
who
lived
in
the
city
of
richmond
would
send
their
slaves
here
for
punishment
when
any
one
wanted
a
slave
whipped
he
would
send
a
note
to
that
effect
with
the
servant
to
the
trader
any
petty
offense
on
the
part
of
a
slave
was
sufficient
to
subject
the
offender
to
this
brutal
treatment
owners
who
affected
culture
and
refinement
preferred
to
send
a
servant
to
the
yard
for
punishment
to
inflicting
it
themselves
it
saved
them
trouble
they
said
and
possibly
a
slight
wear
and
tear
of
feeling
for
this
service
the
owner
was
charged
a
certain
sum
for
each
slave
and
the
earnings
of
the
traders
from
this
source
formed
a
very
large
part
of
the
profits
of
his
business
the
yard
i
was
in
had
a
regular
whipping
post
to
which
they
tied
the
slave
and
gave
him
as
it
was
called
meaning
lashes
as
hard
as
they
could
lay
it
on
men
were
stripped
of
their
shirts
in
preparation
for
the
whipping
and
women
had
to
take
off
their
dresses
from
the
shoulders
to
the
waist
these
whippings
were
not
so
severe
as
when
the
slaves
were
stripped
entirely
of
their
clothes
as
was
generally
the
case
on
the
plantations
where
slaves
were
owned
by
the
dozen
i
saw
many
cases
of
whipping
while
i
was
in
the
yard
sometimes
i
was
so
frightened
that
i
trembled
violently
for
i
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
sold
in
the
market
i
was
only
in
the
yard
a
short
time
before
i
was
bought
by
one
george
reid
who
lived
in
richmond
he
had
no
wife
but
an
old
lady
kept
house
for
him
and
his
three
sons
at
this
time
he
had
a
place
in
the
postoffice
but
soon
after
i
came
there
he
lost
it
he
then
moved
into
the
country
upon
a
farm
of
about
one
thousand
acres
enclosed
by
a
cedar
hedge
the
house
was
a
plain
frame
structure
upon
a
stone
basement
and
contained
four
rooms
it
was
surrounded
with
shrubbery
and
was
a
pleasant
country
seat
but
i
did
not
like
it
here
i
grieved
continually
about
my
mother
it
came
to
me
more
and
more
plainly
that
i
would
never
see
her
again
young
and
lonely
as
i
was
i
could
not
help
crying
oftentimes
for
hours
together
it
was
hard
to
get
used
to
being
away
from
my
mother
i
remember
well
aunt
sylvia
who
was
the
cook
in
the
reid
household
she
was
very
kind
to
me
and
always
spoke
consolingly
to
me
especially
if
i
had
been
blue
and
had
had
one
of
my
fits
of
crying
at
these
times
she
would
always
bake
me
an
ash
cake
for
supper
saying
to
me
my
child
do
cry
sylvia
will
look
after
you
this
ash
cake
was
made
of
corn
meal
and
water
a
little
salt
to
make
it
palatable
and
was
baked
by
putting
it
between
cabbage
leaves
and
covering
it
with
hot
ashes
a
sweeter
or
more
delicious
cake
one
could
not
desire
and
it
was
common
upon
the
tables
of
all
the
virginia
farmers
i
always
considered
it
a
great
treat
to
get
one
of
these
cakes
from
aunt
sylvia
the
appellations
of
aunt
and
uncle
for
the
older
slaves
were
not
only
common
among
the
blacks
but
the
whites
also
addressed
them
in
the
same
way
on
the
auction
block
i
was
sick
a
great
deal
in
fact
i
had
suffered
with
chills
and
fever
ever
since
reid
bought
me
he
therefore
concluded
to
sell
me
and
in
november
he
took
me
back
to
richmond
placing
me
in
the
exchange
building
or
auction
rooms
for
the
sale
of
slaves
the
sales
were
carried
on
in
a
large
hall
where
those
interested
in
the
business
sat
around
a
large
block
or
stand
upon
which
the
slave
to
be
sold
was
placed
the
auctioneer
standing
beside
him
when
i
was
placed
upon
the
block
a
mcgee
came
up
and
felt
of
me
and
asked
me
what
i
could
do
you
look
like
a
right
smart
nigger
said
he
virginia
always
produces
good
darkies
virginia
was
the
mother
of
slavery
and
it
was
held
by
many
that
she
had
the
best
slaves
so
when
mcgee
found
i
was
born
and
bred
in
that
state
he
seemed
satisfied
the
bidding
commenced
and
i
remember
well
when
the
auctioneer
said
three
hundred
eighty
dollars
once
twice
and
sold
to
edward
mcgee
he
was
a
rich
cotton
planter
of
pontotoc
miss
as
near
as
i
can
recollect
i
was
not
more
than
twelve
years
of
age
so
did
not
sell
for
very
much
price
of
slaves
servant
women
sold
for
to
and
sometimes
as
high
as
when
possessing
extra
qualifications
a
house
maid
bright
in
looks
strong
and
well
formed
would
sell
for
to
bright
mulatto
girls
well
versed
in
sewing
and
knitting
would
sometimes
bring
as
high
as
especially
if
a
virginian
or
a
kentuckian
good
blacksmiths
sold
for
to
when
the
slaves
were
put
upon
the
block
they
were
always
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
mcgee
or
boss
as
i
soon
learned
to
call
him
bought
sixty
other
slaves
before
he
bought
me
and
they
were
started
in
a
herd
for
atlanta
on
foot
started
for
a
cotton
plantation
boss
myself
and
ten
others
met
them
there
we
then
started
for
pontotoc
miss
on
our
way
we
stopped
at
edenton
where
boss
sold
of
the
sixty
slaves
we
then
proceeded
on
our
way
boss
by
rail
and
we
on
foot
or
in
the
wagon
we
went
about
twenty
miles
a
day
i
remember
as
we
passed
along
every
white
man
we
met
was
yelling
hurrah
for
polk
and
dallas
they
were
feeling
good
for
election
had
given
them
the
men
that
they
wanted
the
man
who
had
us
in
charge
joined
with
those
we
met
in
the
hurrahing
we
were
afraid
to
ask
them
the
reason
for
their
yelling
as
that
would
have
been
regarded
as
an
impertinence
and
probably
would
have
caused
us
all
to
be
whipped
my
mississippi
home
at
length
after
a
long
and
wearisome
journey
we
reached
pontotoc
mcgee
home
on
christmas
eve
boss
took
me
into
the
house
and
into
the
sitting
room
where
all
the
family
were
assembled
and
presented
me
as
a
christmas
gift
to
the
madam
his
wife
my
boss
as
i
remember
him
was
a
tall
man
but
rather
distinguished
in
looks
with
a
fine
carriage
brilliant
in
intellect
and
considered
one
of
the
wealthiest
and
most
successful
planters
of
his
time
mcgee
was
a
handsome
stately
lady
about
thirty
years
of
age
brunette
in
complexion
faultless
in
figure
and
imperious
in
manner
i
think
that
they
were
of
scotch
descent
there
were
four
children
emma
willie
johnnie
and
jimmie
all
looked
at
me
and
thought
i
was
a
spry
little
fellow
i
was
very
shy
and
did
not
say
much
as
everything
was
strange
to
me
i
was
put
to
sleep
that
night
on
a
pallet
on
the
floor
in
the
dining
room
using
an
old
quilt
as
a
covering
the
next
morning
was
christmas
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
custom
to
have
before
breakfast
the
process
of
making
this
was
new
and
interesting
to
me
i
saw
them
whip
the
whites
of
eggs
on
a
platter
to
a
stiff
froth
the
yolks
were
thoroughly
beaten
in
a
large
bowl
sugar
and
plenty
of
good
brandy
were
added
and
the
whites
of
the
eggs
and
cream
were
then
stirred
in
a
little
nutmeg
grated
on
top
of
each
glass
when
filled
for
serving
this
was
a
delicious
drink
and
the
best
of
all
was
there
was
plenty
of
it
i
served
this
to
all
the
family
and
as
there
were
also
visiting
relatives
present
many
glasses
were
required
and
i
found
the
tray
so
heavy
i
could
hardly
carry
it
i
helped
myself
after
the
service
was
finished
and
i
was
delighted
for
i
had
never
tasted
anything
so
fine
before
my
boss
told
me
i
was
to
wait
on
the
madam
do
any
errand
necessary
attend
to
the
dining
room
in
fact
i
was
installed
as
general
utility
boy
it
was
different
from
the
quiet
manner
of
life
i
had
seen
before
coming
here
it
kept
my
spirits
up
for
some
time
i
thought
of
my
mother
often
but
i
was
gradually
growing
to
the
idea
that
it
was
useless
to
cry
and
i
tried
hard
to
overcome
my
feelings
plantation
life
as
already
stated
it
was
christmas
morning
and
after
breakfast
i
saw
the
cook
hurrying
and
when
i
went
out
into
the
yard
everywhere
i
looked
slaves
met
my
view
i
never
saw
so
many
slaves
at
one
time
before
in
virginia
we
did
not
have
such
large
farms
there
were
no
extensive
cotton
plantations
as
in
mississippi
i
shall
never
forget
the
dinner
that
day
it
was
a
feast
fit
for
a
king
so
varied
and
lavish
was
the
bill
of
fare
the
next
attraction
for
me
was
the
farm
hands
getting
their
christmas
rations
each
was
given
a
pint
of
flour
of
which
they
made
biscuit
which
were
called
billy
seldom
because
biscuit
were
very
rare
with
them
their
daily
food
was
corn
bread
which
they
called
johnny
constant
as
they
had
it
constantly
in
addition
to
the
flour
each
received
a
piece
of
bacon
or
fat
meat
from
which
they
got
the
shortening
for
their
biscuit
the
cracklings
from
the
rendering
of
lard
were
also
used
by
the
slaves
for
shortening
the
hands
were
allowed
four
days
off
at
christmas
and
if
they
worked
on
these
days
as
some
of
them
did
they
got
fifty
cents
a
day
for
chopping
it
was
not
common
to
have
chopping
done
during
the
holidays
some
planters
however
found
it
convenient
thus
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
for
the
work
which
came
after
christmas
the
great
house
i
soon
became
familiar
with
my
work
in
the
house
and
with
the
neighborhood
as
i
often
had
to
carry
notes
for
boss
to
neighboring
farmers
as
well
as
to
carry
the
mail
to
and
from
the
postoffice
the
great
house
as
the
dwelling
of
the
master
was
called
was
two
stories
high
built
of
huge
logs
chinked
and
daubed
and
whitewashed
it
was
divided
from
front
to
rear
by
a
hall
feet
long
and
twelve
feet
wide
and
on
each
side
of
the
hall
in
each
story
was
one
large
room
with
a
large
there
were
but
four
rooms
in
all
yet
these
were
so
large
that
they
were
equal
to
at
least
six
of
our
modern
rooms
the
kitchen
was
not
attached
to
the
main
building
but
was
about
thirty
feet
to
the
rear
this
was
the
common
mode
of
building
in
the
south
in
those
days
the
two
bedrooms
upstairs
were
very
plain
in
furnishings
but
neat
and
comfortable
judged
by
the
standard
of
the
times
a
wing
was
added
to
the
main
building
for
dining
room
in
rear
of
the
kitchen
was
the
milk
or
dairy
house
and
beyond
this
the
smoke
house
for
curing
the
meat
in
line
with
these
buildings
and
still
further
to
the
rear
was
the
overseer
house
near
the
milk
house
was
a
large
tree
and
attached
to
the
trunk
was
a
lever
and
here
was
where
the
churning
was
done
in
which
i
had
always
to
assist
this
establishment
will
serve
as
a
sample
of
many
of
those
on
the
large
plantations
in
the
south
the
main
road
from
pontotoc
to
holly
springs
one
of
the
great
thoroughfares
of
the
state
and
a
stage
route
passed
near
the
house
and
through
the
center
of
the
farm
on
each
side
of
this
road
was
a
fence
and
in
the
corners
of
both
fences
extending
for
a
mile
were
planted
peach
trees
which
bore
excellent
fruit
in
great
profusion
house
servant
and
errand
boy
my
first
work
in
the
morning
was
to
dust
the
parlor
and
hall
and
arrange
the
dining
room
it
came
awkward
to
me
at
first
but
after
the
madam
told
me
how
i
soon
learned
to
do
it
satisfactorily
then
i
had
to
wait
on
the
table
sweep
the
large
yard
every
morning
with
a
brush
broom
and
go
for
the
mail
once
a
week
i
used
to
get
very
tired
for
i
was
young
and
consequently
not
strong
aside
from
these
things
which
came
regularly
i
had
to
help
the
madam
in
warping
the
cloth
i
dreaded
this
work
for
i
always
got
my
ears
boxed
if
i
did
not
or
could
not
do
the
work
to
suit
her
she
always
made
the
warp
herself
and
put
it
in
and
i
had
to
hand
her
the
thread
as
she
put
it
through
the
harness
i
would
get
very
tired
at
this
work
and
like
any
child
wanted
to
be
at
play
but
i
could
not
remember
that
the
madam
ever
gave
me
that
privilege
saddling
the
horse
at
first
was
troublesome
to
me
but
boss
was
constant
in
his
efforts
to
teach
me
and
after
many
trials
i
learned
the
task
satisfactorily
to
the
master
and
to
bring
the
horse
to
the
door
when
he
wished
to
go
out
for
business
or
pleasure
riding
horseback
was
common
for
both
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
sometimes
i
would
have
to
saddle
three
or
more
horses
when
boss
the
madam
a
friend
or
friends
desired
a
ride
bird
hunting
parties
were
common
and
were
greatly
enjoyed
by
the
young
people
especially
boss
always
invited
some
of
the
young
people
of
the
neighborhood
to
these
parties
and
they
never
failed
to
put
in
an
appearance
williams
bradford
and
freeman
were
the
sons
of
rich
planters
and
were
always
participants
in
this
sport
and
their
young
lady
friends
joined
in
it
as
the
young
men
singing
and
whistling
to
the
birds
i
in
the
meantime
setting
the
net
as
soon
as
i
had
got
the
net
in
order
they
would
approach
the
birds
slowly
driving
them
into
it
there
was
great
laughter
and
excitement
if
they
were
successful
in
catching
a
fine
flock
cruel
treatment
i
was
but
a
lad
yet
i
can
remember
well
the
cruel
treatment
i
received
some
weeks
it
seemed
i
was
whipped
for
nothing
just
to
please
my
mistress
fancy
once
when
i
was
sent
to
town
for
the
mail
and
had
started
back
it
was
so
dark
and
rainy
my
horse
got
away
from
me
and
i
had
to
stay
all
night
in
town
the
next
morning
when
i
got
back
home
i
had
a
severe
whipping
because
the
master
was
expecting
a
letter
containing
money
and
was
disappointed
in
not
receiving
it
that
night
as
he
was
going
to
panola
to
spend
christmas
however
the
day
came
and
all
the
family
went
except
me
during
the
time
they
were
gone
the
overseer
whipped
a
man
so
terribly
with
the
bull
whip
that
i
had
to
go
for
the
doctor
and
when
heningford
the
regular
family
physician
came
he
said
it
was
awful
such
cruel
treatment
and
he
complained
about
it
it
was
common
for
a
slave
to
get
an
that
is
to
be
whipped
too
much
the
poor
man
was
cut
up
so
badly
all
over
that
the
doctor
made
a
bran
poultice
and
wrapped
his
entire
body
in
it
this
was
done
to
draw
out
the
inflammation
it
seems
the
slave
had
been
sick
and
had
killed
a
little
pig
when
he
became
well
enough
to
go
to
work
as
his
appetite
craved
hearty
food
and
he
needed
it
to
give
him
strength
for
his
tasks
for
this
one
act
comparatively
trivial
he
was
almost
killed
the
idea
never
seemed
to
occur
to
the
slave
holders
that
these
slaves
were
getting
no
wages
for
their
work
and
therefore
had
nothing
with
which
to
procure
what
at
times
was
necessary
for
their
health
and
strength
palatable
and
nourishing
food
when
the
slaves
took
anything
the
masters
called
it
stealing
yet
they
were
stealing
the
slaves
time
year
after
year
when
boss
came
home
he
was
called
on
by
the
town
officials
for
the
case
had
been
reported
to
them
boss
however
got
out
of
it
by
saying
that
he
was
not
at
home
when
the
trouble
occurred
the
poor
slave
was
sick
from
his
ill
treatment
some
four
or
five
months
and
when
he
recovered
there
was
a
running
sore
left
on
his
body
from
the
deep
cuts
of
the
whip
which
never
healed
i
can
not
forget
how
he
looked
the
sore
was
a
sickening
sight
yet
when
he
was
able
to
walk
he
had
to
return
to
work
in
the
field
i
had
not
been
at
pontotoc
very
long
when
i
saw
the
hounds
run
a
slave
by
name
ben
lyon
old
ben
as
he
was
called
ran
away
and
had
been
gone
a
week
when
he
was
seen
by
a
woman
who
told
on
him
and
then
i
was
sent
to
get
the
man
who
had
trained
dogs
or
hounds
as
they
were
called
the
dogs
ran
the
slave
about
ten
miles
when
they
lost
track
at
a
creek
but
he
was
caught
that
night
in
a
farmer
house
getting
something
to
eat
instructions
in
medicine
after
some
time
boss
began
to
tell
me
the
names
of
medicines
and
their
properties
i
liked
this
and
seemed
to
grasp
the
idea
very
well
after
giving
me
a
number
of
names
he
would
make
me
repeat
them
then
he
would
tell
me
the
properties
of
each
medicine
named
how
it
was
used
and
for
what
purpose
and
how
much
constituted
a
dose
he
would
drill
me
in
all
this
until
i
knew
it
and
in
a
short
time
he
would
add
other
names
to
the
list
he
always
showed
me
each
medicine
named
and
had
me
smell
and
carefully
examine
it
that
i
might
know
it
when
seen
again
i
liked
this
and
used
to
wish
that
i
was
as
wise
as
my
master
he
was
very
precise
steady
and
gentle
in
any
case
of
sickness
and
although
he
had
long
retired
from
the
medical
world
all
recognized
his
merit
wherever
he
went
i
used
to
go
to
the
woods
and
gather
slippery
elm
alum
root
and
the
roots
of
wild
cherry
and
poplar
for
we
used
all
these
in
compounding
medicines
for
the
servants
the
overseer
whippings
and
other
cruelties
the
overseer
was
a
man
hired
to
look
after
the
farm
and
whip
the
slaves
very
often
they
were
not
only
cruel
but
barbarous
every
farmer
or
planter
considered
an
overseer
a
necessity
as
a
rule
there
was
also
on
each
plantation
a
foreman
one
of
the
brighter
slaves
who
was
held
responsible
for
the
slaves
under
him
and
whipped
if
they
did
not
come
up
to
the
required
task
there
was
too
a
forewoman
who
in
like
manner
had
charge
of
the
female
slaves
and
also
the
boys
and
girls
from
twelve
to
sixteen
years
of
age
and
all
the
old
people
that
were
feeble
this
was
called
the
trash
gang
ah
it
would
make
one
heart
ache
to
see
those
children
and
how
they
were
worked
cold
frosty
mornings
the
little
ones
would
be
crying
from
cold
but
they
had
to
keep
on
aunt
polly
our
forewoman
was
afraid
to
allow
them
to
run
to
get
warm
for
fear
the
overseer
would
see
them
then
she
would
be
whipped
and
he
would
make
her
whip
all
of
the
gang
at
length
i
became
used
to
severe
treatment
of
the
slaves
but
every
little
while
something
would
happen
to
make
me
wish
i
were
dead
everything
was
in
a
bustle
always
there
was
slashing
and
whipping
i
remember
when
boss
made
a
change
in
our
overseer
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
year
riley
one
of
the
slaves
who
was
a
principal
plower
was
not
on
hand
for
work
one
monday
morning
having
been
delayed
in
fixing
the
bridle
of
his
mule
which
the
animal
for
lack
of
something
better
perhaps
had
been
vigorously
chewing
and
rendered
nearly
useless
he
was
therefore
considerably
behind
time
when
he
reached
the
field
without
waiting
to
learn
what
was
the
reason
for
the
delay
the
overseer
sprang
upon
him
with
his
bull
whip
which
was
about
seven
feet
long
lashing
him
with
all
his
strength
every
stroke
leaving
its
mark
upon
the
poor
body
and
finally
the
knot
at
the
end
of
the
whip
buried
itself
in
the
fleshy
part
of
the
arm
and
there
came
around
it
a
festering
sore
he
suffered
greatly
with
it
until
one
night
his
brother
took
out
the
knot
when
the
poor
fellow
was
asleep
for
he
could
not
bear
any
one
to
touch
it
when
he
was
awake
it
was
awful
to
hear
the
cracking
of
that
whip
as
it
was
laid
about
riley
one
would
have
thought
that
an
ox
team
had
gotten
into
the
mire
and
was
being
whipped
out
so
loud
and
sharp
was
the
noise
i
usually
slept
in
the
dining
room
on
the
floor
early
one
morning
an
old
slave
by
name
of
uncle
jim
came
and
knocked
at
the
window
and
upon
my
jumping
up
and
going
to
him
he
told
me
to
tell
boss
that
uncle
jim
was
there
he
had
run
away
some
time
before
and
for
some
reason
had
returned
boss
upon
hearing
the
news
got
up
and
sent
me
to
tell
the
overseer
to
come
at
once
he
came
and
taking
the
bull
whip
a
cowhide
and
a
lot
of
switches
he
and
boss
led
uncle
jim
back
into
the
cow
lot
on
the
side
of
the
hill
where
they
drove
four
stakes
in
the
ground
and
laying
him
flat
on
his
face
tied
his
hands
and
feet
to
these
stakes
after
whipping
him
in
this
position
all
they
wanted
to
a
pail
of
strong
salt
and
water
was
brought
and
the
poor
fellow
was
washed
down
this
washing
was
customary
after
whippings
as
the
planters
claimed
it
drew
out
all
the
soreness
and
healed
the
lacerated
flesh
upon
one
occasion
the
family
being
away
i
was
left
extra
work
to
do
being
set
to
help
three
fellow
slaves
lay
off
the
rows
for
planting
corn
we
did
not
get
them
quite
straight
the
deviation
we
made
from
the
line
was
very
little
and
could
scarcely
be
seen
even
by
an
expert
but
the
least
thing
wrong
about
the
work
would
cause
any
slave
to
be
whipped
and
so
all
four
of
us
were
flogged
the
slave
cabin
there
was
a
section
of
the
plantation
known
as
the
quarters
where
were
situated
the
cabins
of
the
slaves
these
cabins
were
built
of
rough
logs
and
daubed
with
the
red
clay
or
mud
of
the
region
no
attempt
was
made
to
give
them
a
neat
appearance
they
were
not
even
whitewashed
each
cabin
was
about
fourteen
feet
square
containing
but
one
room
and
was
covered
with
oak
boards
three
feet
in
length
split
out
of
logs
by
hand
these
boards
were
not
nailed
on
but
held
in
their
places
by
what
were
termed
laid
across
them
at
right
angles
there
were
in
each
room
two
windows
a
door
and
a
large
rude
the
door
and
window
frames
or
facings
were
held
in
their
places
by
wooden
pins
nails
being
used
only
in
putting
the
doors
together
the
interior
of
the
cabins
had
nothing
more
attractive
than
the
outside
there
was
no
plastering
and
only
a
dirt
floor
the
furniture
consisted
of
one
bed
a
plain
board
table
and
some
benches
made
by
the
slaves
themselves
sometimes
a
cabin
was
occupied
by
two
or
more
families
in
which
case
the
number
of
beds
was
increased
proportionately
for
light
a
grease
lamp
was
used
which
was
made
of
iron
bowl
shaped
by
a
blacksmith
the
bowl
was
filled
with
grease
and
a
rag
or
wick
placed
in
it
one
end
resting
on
the
edge
for
lighting
these
lamps
gave
a
good
light
and
were
in
general
use
among
the
slaves
tallow
candles
were
a
luxury
never
seen
except
in
the
great
houses
of
the
planters
the
only
light
for
outdoors
used
by
the
slaves
was
a
torch
made
by
binding
together
a
bundle
of
small
sticks
or
splinters
cotton
raising
after
the
selection
of
the
soil
most
suitable
for
cotton
the
preparation
of
it
was
of
vital
importance
the
land
was
deeply
plowed
long
enough
before
the
time
for
planting
to
allow
the
spring
rains
to
settle
it
then
it
was
thrown
into
beds
or
ridges
by
turning
furrows
both
ways
toward
a
given
center
the
seed
was
planted
at
the
rate
of
one
hundred
pounds
per
acre
the
plant
made
its
appearance
in
about
ten
days
after
planting
if
the
weather
was
favorable
early
planting
however
followed
by
cold
stormy
weather
frequently
caused
the
seed
to
rot
as
soon
as
the
third
leaf
appeared
the
process
of
scraping
commenced
which
consisted
of
cleaning
the
ridge
with
hoes
of
all
superfluous
plants
and
all
weeds
and
grass
after
this
a
narrow
plow
known
as
a
bull
tongue
was
used
to
turn
the
loose
earth
around
the
plant
and
cover
up
any
grass
not
totally
destroyed
by
the
hoes
if
the
surface
was
very
rough
the
hoes
followed
instead
of
preceding
the
plow
to
unearth
those
plants
that
may
have
been
partially
covered
the
slaves
often
acquired
great
skill
in
these
operations
running
plows
within
two
inches
of
the
stalks
and
striking
down
weeds
within
half
an
inch
with
their
hoes
rarely
touching
a
leaf
of
the
cotton
subsequent
plowing
alternating
with
hoeing
usually
occurred
once
in
twenty
days
there
was
danger
in
deep
plowing
of
injuring
the
roots
and
this
was
avoided
except
in
the
middle
of
rows
in
wet
seasons
when
it
was
necessary
to
bury
and
more
effectually
kill
the
grass
the
implements
used
in
the
culture
of
cotton
were
shovels
hoes
sweeps
cultivators
harrows
and
two
kinds
of
plows
it
required
four
months
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
for
cotton
to
attain
its
full
growth
it
was
usually
planted
about
the
of
april
or
from
march
to
april
bloomed
about
the
of
june
and
the
first
balls
opened
about
august
when
picking
commenced
the
blooms
come
out
in
the
morning
and
are
fully
developed
by
noon
when
they
are
a
pure
white
soon
after
meridian
they
begin
to
exhibit
reddish
streaks
and
next
morning
are
a
clear
pink
they
fall
off
by
noon
of
the
second
day
the
cotton
worm
a
cut
worm
was
troublesome
sometimes
but
the
plants
were
watched
very
carefully
and
as
soon
as
any
signs
of
worms
were
seen
work
for
their
destruction
was
commenced
the
majority
of
the
eggs
were
laid
upon
the
calyx
and
involucre
the
worm
after
gnawing
through
its
enclosed
shell
makes
its
first
meal
upon
the
part
of
the
plant
upon
which
the
egg
was
laid
be
it
leaf
stem
or
involucre
if
it
were
laid
upon
the
leaf
as
was
usually
the
case
it
might
be
three
days
before
the
worm
reached
the
boll
but
were
the
eggs
laid
upon
the
involucre
the
worm
pierced
through
within
hours
after
hatching
the
newly
hatched
boll
worm
walks
like
a
geometrical
larva
or
looper
a
measuring
worm
as
it
was
called
this
is
easily
explained
by
the
fact
that
while
in
the
full
grown
worm
the
abdominal
legs
or
pro
legs
are
nearly
equal
in
length
in
the
newly
hatched
worm
the
second
pair
are
slightly
shorter
than
the
third
and
the
first
pair
are
shorter
and
slenderer
than
the
second
a
state
of
things
approaching
that
in
the
full
grown
cotton
worm
though
the
difference
in
size
in
the
former
case
is
not
nearly
so
marked
as
in
the
latter
this
method
of
walking
is
lost
with
the
first
or
second
molt
there
is
nothing
remarkable
about
these
young
larvae
they
seem
to
be
thicker
in
proportion
to
their
length
than
the
young
cotton
worms
and
they
have
not
so
delicate
and
transparent
an
appearance
their
heads
are
black
and
their
bodies
seem
already
to
have
begun
to
vary
in
color
the
body
above
is
furnished
with
sparse
stiff
hairs
each
arising
from
a
tubercle
i
have
often
watched
the
newly
hatched
boll
while
in
the
cotton
fields
when
hatched
from
an
egg
which
had
been
deposited
upon
a
leaf
they
invariably
made
their
first
meal
on
the
substance
of
the
leaf
and
then
wandered
about
for
a
longer
or
shorter
space
of
time
evidently
seeking
a
boll
or
flower
bud
it
was
always
interesting
to
watch
this
seemingly
aimless
search
of
the
young
worm
crawling
first
down
the
leaf
stem
and
then
back
then
dropping
a
few
inches
by
a
silken
thread
and
then
painfully
working
its
way
back
again
until
at
last
it
found
the
object
of
its
search
or
fell
to
the
ground
where
it
was
destroyed
by
ants
as
the
boll
worms
increase
in
size
a
most
wonderful
diversity
of
color
and
marking
becomes
apparent
in
color
different
worms
will
vary
from
a
brilliant
green
to
a
deep
pink
or
dark
brown
exhibiting
almost
every
conceivable
intermediate
stage
from
an
immaculate
unstriped
specimen
to
one
with
regular
spots
and
many
stripes
the
green
worms
were
more
common
than
those
of
any
other
color
a
common
variety
was
a
very
light
green
when
these
worms
put
in
an
appearance
it
raised
a
great
excitement
among
the
planters
we
did
not
use
any
poison
to
destroy
them
as
i
learn
is
the
method
now
employed
the
cotton
harvest
the
cotton
harvest
or
picking
season
began
about
the
latter
part
of
august
or
first
of
september
and
lasted
till
christmas
or
after
but
in
the
latter
part
of
july
picking
commenced
for
the
first
bale
to
go
into
the
market
at
memphis
this
picking
was
done
by
children
from
nine
to
twelve
years
of
age
and
by
women
who
were
known
as
sucklers
that
is
women
with
infants
the
pickers
would
pass
through
the
rows
getting
very
little
as
the
cotton
was
not
yet
in
full
bloom
from
the
lower
part
of
the
stalk
where
it
opened
first
is
where
they
got
the
first
pickings
the
season
of
first
picking
was
always
a
great
time
for
the
planter
who
brought
the
first
bale
of
cotton
into
market
at
memphis
was
presented
with
a
basket
of
champagne
by
the
commission
merchants
this
was
a
custom
established
throughout
mississippi
after
the
first
pickings
were
secured
the
cotton
developed
very
fast
continuing
to
bud
and
bloom
all
over
the
stalk
until
the
frost
falls
the
season
of
picking
was
exciting
to
all
planters
every
one
was
zealous
in
pushing
his
slaves
in
order
that
he
might
reap
the
greatest
possible
harvest
the
planters
talked
about
their
prospects
discussed
the
cotton
markets
just
as
the
farmers
of
the
north
discuss
the
markets
for
their
products
i
often
saw
boss
so
excited
and
nervous
during
the
season
he
scarcely
ate
the
daily
task
of
each
slave
during
the
cotton
picking
season
war
pounds
or
more
and
all
those
who
did
not
come
up
to
the
required
amount
would
get
a
whipping
when
the
planter
wanted
more
cotton
picked
than
usual
the
overseer
would
arrange
a
race
the
slaves
would
be
divided
into
two
parties
with
a
leader
for
each
party
the
first
leader
would
choose
a
slave
for
his
side
then
the
second
leader
one
for
his
and
so
on
alternately
until
all
were
chosen
each
leader
tried
to
get
the
best
on
his
side
they
would
all
work
like
good
fellows
for
the
prize
which
was
a
tin
cup
of
sugar
for
each
slave
on
the
winning
side
the
contest
was
kept
up
for
three
days
whenever
the
planter
desired
an
extra
amount
picked
the
slaves
were
just
as
interested
in
the
races
as
if
they
were
going
to
get
a
five
dollar
bill
preparing
cotton
for
market
the
was
situated
about
four
hundred
yards
from
the
great
house
on
the
main
road
it
was
a
large
shed
built
upon
square
timbers
and
was
similar
to
a
barn
only
it
stood
some
six
feet
from
the
ground
and
underneath
was
located
the
machinery
for
running
the
gin
the
cotton
was
put
into
the
loft
after
it
was
dried
ready
for
ginning
in
this
process
the
cotton
was
dropped
from
the
loft
to
the
man
who
fed
the
machine
as
it
was
ginned
the
lint
would
go
into
the
lint
room
and
the
seed
would
drop
at
the
feeder
feet
the
baskets
used
for
holding
lint
were
twice
as
large
as
those
used
in
the
picking
process
and
they
were
never
taken
from
the
gin
house
these
lint
baskets
were
used
in
removing
the
lint
from
the
lint
room
to
the
place
where
the
cotton
was
baled
a
bale
contained
pounds
and
the
man
who
did
the
treading
of
the
cotton
into
the
bales
would
not
vary
ten
pounds
in
the
bale
so
accustomed
was
he
to
the
packing
generally
from
fourteen
to
fifteen
bales
of
cotton
were
in
the
lint
room
at
a
time
other
farm
products
cotton
was
the
chief
product
of
the
mississippi
farms
and
nothing
else
was
raised
to
sell
wheat
oats
and
rye
were
raised
in
limited
quantities
but
only
for
the
slaves
and
the
stock
all
the
fine
flour
for
the
master
family
was
bought
in
louis
corn
was
raised
in
abundance
as
it
was
a
staple
article
of
food
for
the
slaves
it
was
planted
about
the
of
march
or
about
a
month
earlier
than
the
cotton
it
was
therefore
up
and
partially
worked
before
the
cotton
was
planted
and
fully
tilled
before
the
cotton
was
ready
for
cultivation
peas
were
planted
between
the
rows
of
corn
and
hundreds
of
bushels
were
raised
these
peas
after
being
harvested
dried
and
beaten
out
of
the
shell
were
of
a
reddish
brown
tint
not
like
those
raised
for
the
master
family
but
they
were
considered
a
wholesome
and
nutritious
food
for
the
slaves
cabbage
and
yams
a
large
sweet
potato
coarser
than
the
kind
generally
used
by
the
whites
and
not
so
delicate
in
flavor
were
also
raised
for
the
servants
in
liberal
quantities
no
hay
was
raised
but
the
leaves
of
the
corn
stripped
from
the
stalks
while
yet
green
cured
and
bound
in
bundles
were
used
as
a
substitute
for
it
in
feeding
horses
farm
implements
almost
all
the
implements
used
on
the
plantation
were
made
by
the
slaves
very
few
things
were
bought
boss
had
a
skilled
blacksmith
uncle
ben
for
whom
he
paid
and
there
were
slaves
who
were
carpenters
and
workers
in
wood
who
could
turn
their
hands
to
almost
anything
wagons
plows
harrows
grubbing
hoes
hames
collars
baskets
bridle
bits
and
hoe
handles
were
all
made
on
the
farm
and
from
the
material
which
it
produced
except
the
iron
the
timber
used
in
these
implements
was
generally
white
or
red
oak
and
was
cut
and
thoroughly
seasoned
long
before
it
was
needed
the
articles
thus
manufactured
were
not
fine
in
form
or
finish
but
they
were
durable
and
answered
the
purposes
of
a
rude
method
of
agriculture
horse
collars
were
made
from
corn
husks
and
from
poplar
bark
which
was
stripped
from
the
tree
in
the
spring
when
the
sap
was
up
and
it
was
soft
and
pliable
and
separated
into
narrow
strips
which
were
plaited
together
these
collars
were
easy
for
the
horse
and
served
the
purpose
of
the
more
costly
leather
collar
every
season
at
least
cotton
baskets
were
made
one
man
usually
worked
at
this
all
the
year
round
but
in
the
spring
he
had
three
assistants
the
baskets
were
made
from
oak
timber
grown
in
the
home
forests
and
prepared
by
the
slaves
it
was
no
small
part
of
the
work
of
the
blacksmith
and
his
assistant
to
keep
the
farm
implements
in
good
repair
and
much
of
this
work
was
done
at
night
all
the
plank
used
was
sawed
by
hand
from
timber
grown
on
the
master
land
as
there
were
no
saw
mills
in
that
region
almost
the
only
things
not
made
on
the
farm
which
were
in
general
use
there
were
axes
trace
chains
and
the
hoes
used
in
cultivating
the
cotton
the
clearing
of
new
land
when
additional
land
was
required
for
cultivation
the
first
step
was
to
go
into
the
forest
in
summer
and
deaden
or
girdle
the
trees
on
a
given
tract
this
was
cutting
through
the
bark
all
around
the
trunk
about
thirty
inches
from
the
ground
the
trees
so
treated
soon
died
and
in
a
year
or
two
were
in
condition
to
be
removed
the
season
selected
for
clearing
the
land
was
winter
beginning
with
january
the
trees
except
the
larger
ones
were
cut
down
cut
into
lengths
convenient
for
handling
and
piled
into
great
heaps
called
log
heaps
and
burned
the
undergrowth
was
grubbed
out
and
also
piled
and
burned
the
burning
was
done
at
night
and
the
sight
was
often
weird
and
grand
the
chopping
was
done
by
the
men
slaves
and
the
grubbing
by
women
all
the
trees
that
blew
down
during
the
summer
were
left
as
they
fell
till
winter
when
they
were
removed
this
went
on
year
after
year
until
all
the
trees
were
cleared
out
the
first
year
after
the
new
land
was
cleared
corn
was
put
in
the
next
season
cotton
as
a
rule
corn
and
cotton
were
planted
alternately
especially
if
the
land
was
poor
if
not
cotton
would
be
continued
year
after
year
on
the
same
land
old
corn
stalks
were
always
plowed
under
for
the
next
year
crop
and
they
served
as
an
excellent
fertilizer
cotton
was
seldom
planted
on
newly
cleared
land
as
the
roots
and
stumps
rendered
it
difficult
to
cultivate
the
land
without
injury
to
the
growing
plant
i
never
saw
women
put
to
the
hard
work
of
grubbing
until
i
went
to
mcgee
and
i
greatly
wondered
at
it
such
work
was
not
done
by
women
slaves
in
virginia
children
were
required
to
do
some
work
it
mattered
not
how
many
grown
people
were
working
there
were
always
tasks
set
for
the
boys
and
girls
ranging
in
age
from
nine
to
thirteen
years
beyond
these
ages
they
worked
with
the
older
slaves
after
i
had
been
in
pontotoc
two
years
i
had
to
help
plant
and
hoe
and
work
in
the
cotton
during
the
seasons
and
soon
learned
to
do
everything
pertaining
to
the
farm
cooking
for
the
slaves
in
summer
time
the
cooking
for
the
slaves
was
done
out
of
doors
a
large
fire
was
built
under
a
tree
two
wooden
forks
were
driven
into
the
ground
on
opposite
sides
of
the
fire
a
pole
laid
on
the
forks
and
on
this
kettles
were
hung
over
the
fire
for
the
preparation
of
the
food
cabbage
and
meat
boiled
alternated
with
meat
and
peas
were
the
staple
for
summer
bread
was
furnished
with
the
meals
and
corn
meal
dumplings
that
is
little
balls
made
of
meal
and
grease
from
the
boiled
bacon
and
dropped
into
boiling
water
were
also
provided
and
considered
quite
palatable
especially
if
cooked
in
the
water
in
which
the
bacon
was
boiled
in
winter
the
cooking
was
done
in
a
cabin
and
sweet
potatoes
dried
peas
and
meat
were
the
principal
diet
this
bill
of
fare
was
for
dinner
or
the
meal
for
supper
each
slave
received
two
pieces
of
meat
and
two
slices
of
bread
but
these
slices
were
very
large
as
the
loaves
were
about
six
inches
thick
and
baked
in
an
old
fashioned
oven
this
bread
was
made
from
corn
meal
for
as
i
have
said
only
on
holidays
and
special
occasions
did
the
slaves
have
white
bread
of
any
kind
part
of
the
meat
and
bread
received
at
supper
time
was
saved
for
the
morning
bite
the
slaves
never
had
any
breakfast
but
went
to
the
field
at
daylight
and
after
working
till
the
sun
was
well
up
all
would
stop
for
their
morning
bite
very
often
some
young
fellow
ate
his
morning
bite
the
evening
before
at
supper
and
would
have
nothing
for
the
morning
going
without
eating
until
noon
the
stop
for
morning
bite
was
very
short
then
all
would
plunge
into
work
until
when
all
hands
were
summoned
to
their
principal
meal
carding
and
spinning
through
the
winter
and
on
rainy
days
in
summer
the
women
of
the
field
had
to
card
the
wool
and
spin
it
into
yarn
they
generally
worked
in
pairs
a
spinning
wheel
and
cards
being
assigned
to
each
pair
and
while
one
carded
the
wool
into
rolls
the
other
spun
it
into
yarn
suitable
for
weaving
into
cloth
or
a
coarse
heavy
thread
used
in
making
bridles
and
lines
for
the
mules
that
were
used
in
the
fields
this
work
was
done
in
the
cabins
and
the
women
working
together
alternated
in
the
carding
and
spinning
four
cuts
were
considered
a
task
or
day
work
and
if
any
one
failed
to
complete
her
task
she
received
a
whipping
from
the
madam
at
night
when
the
spinners
brought
their
work
to
the
big
house
i
would
have
it
to
reel
the
reel
was
a
contrivance
consisting
of
a
sort
of
wheel
turned
on
an
axis
used
to
transfer
the
yarn
from
the
spools
or
spindles
of
the
spinning
wheels
into
cuts
or
hunks
it
was
turned
by
hand
and
when
enough
yarn
had
been
reeled
to
make
a
cut
the
reel
signaled
it
with
a
snap
this
process
was
continued
until
four
cuts
were
reeled
which
made
a
hunk
and
this
was
taken
off
and
was
ready
for
use
so
the
work
went
on
until
all
was
reeled
i
often
got
very
weary
of
this
work
and
would
almost
fall
asleep
at
it
as
it
was
generally
done
at
night
after
i
had
had
a
long
day
toil
at
something
else
weaving
clothes
of
the
slaves
one
woman
did
the
weaving
and
it
was
her
task
to
weave
from
nine
to
ten
yards
a
day
aunt
liza
was
our
weaver
and
she
was
taught
the
work
by
the
madam
at
first
she
did
not
get
on
so
well
with
it
and
many
times
i
have
seen
the
madam
jump
at
her
pinch
and
choke
her
because
she
was
dull
in
understanding
how
to
do
it
the
madam
made
the
unreasonable
demand
that
she
should
do
the
full
task
at
first
and
because
she
failed
she
was
punished
as
was
the
custom
in
all
cases
of
failure
no
matter
how
unreasonable
the
demand
liza
finally
became
equal
to
her
task
and
accomplished
it
each
day
but
the
trouble
and
worry
to
me
was
when
i
had
to
assist
the
madam
in
warping
getting
the
work
ready
for
the
weaver
she
would
warp
the
thread
herself
and
place
it
in
the
loom
then
i
would
have
to
hand
her
the
threads
as
she
put
them
through
the
hames
for
any
failure
in
quickly
comprehending
or
doing
my
work
i
did
not
fail
to
receive
the
customary
blow
or
blows
from
her
hand
each
piece
of
cloth
contained
forty
yards
and
this
cloth
was
used
in
making
clothes
for
the
servants
about
half
of
the
whole
amount
required
was
thus
made
at
home
the
remainder
was
bought
and
as
it
was
heavier
it
was
used
for
winter
clothing
each
man
was
allowed
for
summer
two
pairs
of
pants
and
two
shirts
but
no
coat
the
women
had
two
dresses
and
two
chemises
each
for
summer
for
winter
the
men
had
each
two
pairs
of
pants
one
coat
one
hat
and
one
pair
of
coarse
shoes
these
shoes
before
being
worn
had
to
be
greased
with
tallow
with
a
little
tar
in
it
it
was
always
a
happy
time
when
the
men
got
these
winter
goods
it
brought
many
a
smile
to
their
faces
though
the
supply
was
meager
and
the
articles
of
the
cheapest
the
women
dresses
for
winter
were
made
of
the
heavier
used
for
the
men
they
also
had
one
pair
of
shoes
each
and
a
turban
the
women
who
could
utilize
old
clothes
made
for
themselves
what
were
called
pantalets
they
had
no
stockings
or
undergarments
to
protect
their
limbs
these
were
never
given
them
the
pantalets
were
made
like
a
came
just
above
the
knee
and
were
caught
and
tied
sometimes
they
looked
well
and
comfortable
the
old
were
sometimes
used
i
remember
once
when
boss
went
to
memphis
and
brought
back
a
bolt
of
gingham
for
turbans
for
the
female
slaves
it
was
a
red
and
yellow
check
and
the
turbans
made
from
it
were
only
to
be
worn
on
sunday
the
old
women
were
so
glad
that
they
sang
and
prayed
a
little
gift
from
the
master
was
greatly
appreciated
by
them
i
always
came
in
for
my
share
each
year
but
my
clothes
were
somewhat
different
i
wore
pants
made
of
boss
old
ones
and
all
his
old
coats
were
utilized
for
me
they
rounded
them
off
at
the
tail
just
a
little
and
called
them
jackets
my
shoes
were
not
brogans
but
made
of
lighter
leather
and
made
suitable
for
in
the
house
i
only
worked
on
the
farm
in
busy
seasons
and
did
not
have
the
regular
wear
of
the
farm
hands
on
monday
morning
it
was
a
great
sight
to
see
all
the
hands
marching
to
the
field
the
cotton
clothes
worn
by
both
men
and
women
and
the
turbans
of
the
latter
were
snowy
white
as
were
the
wool
hats
of
the
men
all
contrasted
with
the
dark
faces
of
the
wearers
in
a
strange
and
striking
manner
slave
mothers
care
of
the
children
the
women
who
had
young
babies
were
assigned
to
what
was
considered
light
work
such
as
hoeing
potatoes
cutting
weeds
from
the
fence
corners
and
any
other
work
of
like
character
about
nine
in
the
forenoon
at
noon
and
three
in
the
afternoon
these
women
known
on
the
farms
as
the
sucklers
could
be
seen
going
from
work
to
nurse
their
babies
many
were
the
of
these
sorrowing
mothers
as
they
went
to
minister
to
their
infants
sometimes
the
little
things
would
seem
starved
for
the
mothers
could
only
stop
their
toil
three
times
a
day
to
care
for
them
when
old
enough
to
receive
it
the
babies
had
milk
the
liquor
from
boiled
cabbage
and
bread
and
milk
together
a
woman
who
was
too
old
to
do
much
of
anything
was
assigned
to
the
charge
of
these
babies
in
the
absence
of
their
mothers
it
was
rare
that
she
had
any
one
to
help
her
the
cries
of
these
little
ones
who
were
cut
off
almost
entirely
from
motherly
care
and
protection
were
the
cabin
used
for
the
infants
during
the
day
was
a
double
one
that
is
double
the
usual
size
and
was
located
near
the
great
house
the
cradles
used
were
made
of
boards
and
were
not
more
than
two
by
three
feet
in
size
the
women
carried
their
babies
in
the
cradles
to
the
baby
cabin
in
the
morning
taking
them
to
their
own
cabins
at
night
the
children
ranging
in
age
from
one
to
seven
years
were
numerous
and
the
old
woman
had
them
to
look
after
as
well
as
the
babies
this
was
indeed
a
task
and
might
well
have
taxed
the
strength
of
a
younger
woman
they
were
always
from
eight
to
a
dozen
infants
in
the
cabin
the
summer
season
was
trying
on
the
babies
and
young
children
often
they
would
drink
too
much
liquor
from
cabbage
or
too
much
buttermilk
and
would
be
taken
with
a
severe
colic
i
was
always
called
on
these
occasions
to
go
with
boss
to
administer
medicine
i
remember
on
one
occasion
a
little
boy
had
eaten
too
much
cabbage
and
was
taken
with
cramp
colic
in
a
few
minutes
his
stomach
was
swollen
as
tight
and
hard
as
a
balloon
and
his
teeth
clenched
he
was
given
an
emetic
put
in
a
mustard
bath
and
was
soon
relieved
the
food
was
too
heavy
for
these
children
and
they
were
nearly
always
in
need
of
some
medical
attendance
excessive
heat
with
improper
food
often
brought
on
cholera
infantum
from
which
the
infants
sometimes
died
rapidly
and
in
considerable
numbers
methods
of
punishment
the
methods
of
punishment
were
barbarous
in
the
extreme
and
so
numerous
that
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
them
all
one
method
was
to
tie
the
slave
to
a
tree
strip
off
his
clothes
and
then
whip
him
with
a
rawhide
or
long
limber
switches
or
the
terrible
bull
whip
another
was
to
put
the
slave
in
stocks
or
to
buck
him
that
is
fasten
his
feet
together
draw
up
his
knees
to
his
chin
tie
his
hands
together
draw
them
down
over
the
knees
and
put
a
stick
under
the
latter
and
over
the
arms
in
either
of
these
ways
the
slave
was
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
his
tormentors
and
the
whipping
could
proceed
at
their
pleasure
after
these
whippings
the
slave
was
often
left
helpless
and
bleeding
upon
the
ground
until
the
master
or
overseer
saw
fit
to
let
him
up
the
most
common
method
of
punishment
was
to
have
the
servants
form
a
ring
called
the
bull
ring
into
which
the
one
to
be
punished
was
led
naked
the
slaves
were
then
each
given
a
switch
rawhide
strap
or
whip
and
each
one
was
compelled
to
cut
at
the
poor
victim
as
he
ran
around
the
ring
the
ring
was
composed
of
men
women
and
children
and
as
they
numbered
from
forty
to
fifty
each
circuit
of
the
ring
would
result
in
that
number
of
lashes
and
by
the
time
the
victim
had
made
two
or
three
rounds
his
condition
can
be
readily
imagined
the
overseer
was
always
one
of
the
ring
vigorously
using
the
whip
and
seeing
that
all
the
slaves
did
the
same
some
of
the
victims
fainted
before
they
had
passed
once
around
the
ring
women
slaves
were
punished
in
the
same
manner
as
the
men
the
salt
water
bath
was
given
after
each
punishment
runaway
slaves
were
usually
caught
by
means
of
hounds
trained
for
the
purpose
by
men
who
made
it
a
business
and
a
source
of
revenue
notwithstanding
its
brutal
features
and
degrading
influence
fourth
of
july
barbecue
barbecue
originally
meant
to
dress
and
roast
a
hog
whole
but
has
come
to
mean
the
cooking
of
a
food
animal
in
this
manner
for
the
feeding
of
a
great
company
a
feast
of
this
kind
was
always
given
to
us
by
boss
on
the
of
july
the
anticipation
of
it
acted
as
a
stimulant
through
the
entire
year
each
one
looked
forward
to
this
great
day
of
recreation
with
pleasure
even
the
older
slaves
would
join
in
the
discussion
of
the
coming
event
it
mattered
not
what
trouble
or
hardship
the
year
had
brought
this
feast
and
its
attendant
pleasure
would
dissipate
all
gloom
some
probably
would
be
punished
on
the
morning
of
the
but
this
did
not
matter
the
men
thought
of
the
good
things
in
store
for
them
and
that
made
them
forget
that
they
had
been
punished
all
the
week
previous
to
the
great
day
the
slaves
were
in
high
spirits
the
young
girls
and
boys
each
evening
congregating
in
front
of
the
cabins
to
talk
of
the
feast
while
others
would
sing
and
dance
the
older
slaves
were
not
less
happy
but
would
only
say
ah
god
has
blessed
us
in
permitting
us
to
see
another
feast
day
the
day
before
the
was
a
busy
one
the
slaves
worked
with
all
their
might
the
children
who
were
large
enough
were
engaged
in
bringing
wood
and
bark
to
the
spot
where
the
barbecue
was
to
take
place
they
worked
eagerly
all
day
long
and
by
the
time
the
sun
was
setting
a
huge
pile
of
fuel
was
beside
the
trench
ready
for
use
in
the
morning
at
an
early
hour
of
the
great
day
the
servants
were
up
and
the
men
whom
boss
had
appointed
to
look
after
the
killing
of
the
hogs
and
sheep
were
quickly
at
their
work
and
by
the
time
they
had
the
meat
dressed
and
ready
most
of
the
slaves
had
arrived
at
the
center
of
attraction
they
gathered
in
groups
talking
laughing
telling
tales
that
they
had
from
their
grandfather
or
relating
practical
jokes
that
they
had
played
or
seen
played
by
others
these
tales
were
received
with
peals
of
laughter
but
however
much
they
seemed
to
enjoy
these
stories
and
social
interchanges
they
never
lost
sight
of
the
trench
or
the
spot
where
the
sweetmeats
were
to
be
cooked
the
method
of
cooking
the
meat
was
to
dig
a
trench
in
the
ground
about
six
feet
long
and
eighteen
inches
deep
this
trench
was
filled
with
wood
and
bark
which
was
set
on
fire
and
when
it
was
burned
to
a
great
bed
of
coals
the
hog
was
split
through
the
back
bone
and
laid
on
poles
which
had
been
placed
across
the
trench
the
sheep
were
treated
in
the
same
way
and
both
were
turned
from
side
to
side
as
they
cooked
during
the
process
of
roasting
the
cooks
basted
the
carcasses
with
a
preparation
furnished
from
the
great
house
consisting
of
butter
pepper
salt
and
vinegar
and
this
was
continued
until
the
meat
was
ready
to
serve
not
far
from
this
trench
were
the
iron
ovens
where
the
sweetmeats
were
cooked
three
or
four
women
were
assigned
to
this
work
peach
cobbler
and
apple
dumpling
were
the
two
dishes
that
made
old
slaves
smile
for
joy
and
the
young
fairly
dance
the
crust
or
pastry
of
the
cobbler
was
prepared
in
large
earthen
bowls
then
rolled
out
like
any
pie
crust
only
it
was
almost
twice
as
thick
a
layer
of
this
crust
was
laid
in
the
oven
then
a
half
peck
of
peaches
poured
in
followed
by
a
layer
of
sugar
then
a
covering
of
pastry
was
laid
over
all
and
smoothed
around
with
a
knife
the
oven
was
then
put
over
a
bed
of
coals
the
cover
put
on
and
coals
thrown
on
it
and
the
process
of
baking
began
four
of
these
ovens
were
usually
in
use
at
these
feasts
so
that
enough
of
the
pastry
might
be
baked
to
supply
all
the
ovens
were
filled
and
refilled
until
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
quantity
the
apple
dumplings
were
made
in
the
usual
way
only
larger
and
served
with
sauce
made
from
brown
sugar
it
lacked
flavoring
such
as
cinnamon
or
lemon
yet
it
was
a
dish
highly
relished
by
all
the
slaves
i
know
that
these
feasts
made
me
so
excited
i
could
scarcely
do
my
house
duties
and
i
would
never
fail
to
stop
and
look
out
of
the
window
from
the
dining
room
down
into
the
quarters
i
was
eager
to
get
through
with
my
work
and
be
with
the
feasters
about
noon
everything
was
ready
to
serve
the
table
was
set
in
a
grove
near
the
quarters
a
place
set
aside
for
these
occasions
the
tableware
was
not
fine
being
of
tin
but
it
served
the
purpose
and
did
not
detract
from
the
slaves
relish
for
the
feast
the
drinks
were
strictly
temperance
drinks
buttermilk
and
water
some
of
the
nicest
portions
of
the
meat
were
sliced
off
and
put
on
a
platter
to
send
to
the
great
house
for
boss
and
his
family
it
was
a
pleasure
for
the
slaves
to
do
this
for
boss
always
enjoyed
it
it
was
said
that
the
slaves
could
barbecue
meats
best
and
when
the
whites
had
barbecues
slaves
always
did
the
cooking
when
dinner
was
all
on
the
table
the
invitation
was
given
for
all
to
come
and
when
all
were
in
a
good
way
eating
boss
and
the
madam
would
go
out
to
witness
the
progress
of
the
feast
and
seemed
pleased
to
see
the
servants
so
happy
everything
was
in
abundance
so
all
could
have
plenty
boss
always
insisted
on
this
the
slaves
had
the
whole
day
off
and
could
do
as
they
liked
after
dinner
some
of
the
women
would
wash
sew
or
iron
it
was
a
day
of
harmless
riot
for
all
the
slaves
and
i
can
not
express
the
happiness
it
brought
them
old
and
young
for
months
would
rejoice
in
the
memory
of
the
day
and
its
festivities
and
bless
boss
for
this
ray
of
sunlight
in
their
darkened
lives
attendance
at
church
there
was
an
observance
of
religious
forms
at
least
by
the
occupants
of
both
the
great
house
and
the
cabins
the
mcgee
family
were
people
and
except
in
very
inclement
weather
never
failed
to
attend
service
on
sunday
they
were
methodists
and
their
church
was
four
miles
from
their
residence
the
baptist
church
was
but
two
miles
distant
and
the
family
usually
alternated
in
their
attendance
between
the
two
places
of
worship
i
always
attended
them
to
church
generally
riding
behind
while
the
boss
drove
upon
reaching
church
my
first
duty
was
to
run
to
a
spring
for
a
pitcher
of
fresh
water
which
i
passed
not
only
to
the
members
of
our
party
but
to
any
others
desiring
drink
whatever
may
be
thought
of
the
religious
professions
of
the
there
can
be
no
question
that
many
of
the
slaves
were
sincere
believers
in
the
christian
religion
and
endeavored
to
obey
the
precepts
according
to
their
light
religious
meetings
of
the
slaves
saturday
evening
on
the
farm
was
always
hailed
with
delight
the
air
was
filled
with
happy
shouts
from
men
and
boys
so
glad
were
they
that
sunday
their
only
day
of
rest
was
near
in
the
cabins
the
women
were
washing
and
fixing
garments
for
sunday
that
they
might
honor
the
lord
in
cleanliness
and
decency
it
was
astonishing
how
they
utilized
what
they
had
and
with
what
skill
and
industry
they
performed
these
tasks
where
the
family
was
large
it
was
often
after
midnight
before
this
work
was
done
while
this
preparation
for
the
sabbath
was
in
progress
in
most
of
the
cabins
the
old
men
would
gather
in
one
for
a
as
they
began
to
sing
some
familiar
hymn
the
air
would
ring
with
their
voices
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
cabin
was
filled
with
both
old
and
young
who
came
in
their
simple
yet
sincere
way
to
give
praise
to
god
it
was
common
to
have
one
or
two
exhorters
on
the
plantation
who
claimed
to
be
called
to
do
service
for
god
by
teaching
their
fellow
men
the
principles
of
religion
god
certainly
must
have
revealed
himself
to
these
poor
souls
for
they
were
very
ignorant
they
did
not
know
a
letter
of
the
bible
but
when
they
opened
their
mouths
they
were
filled
and
the
plan
of
salvation
was
explained
in
a
way
that
all
could
receive
it
it
was
always
a
mystery
to
the
white
brethren
how
the
slaves
could
line
out
hymns
preach
christ
and
redemption
yet
have
no
knowledge
even
of
how
the
name
of
christ
was
spelled
they
were
illiterate
to
the
last
degree
so
there
is
but
one
theory
they
were
inspired
god
revealed
unto
them
just
what
they
should
teach
their
flock
the
same
as
he
did
to
moses
i
remember
very
well
that
there
was
always
a
solemnity
about
the
services
a
certain
harmony
which
had
a
peculiar
effect
a
certain
pathetic
tone
which
quickened
the
emotions
as
they
sang
those
old
plantation
hymns
it
mattered
not
what
their
troubles
had
been
during
the
week
how
much
they
had
been
lashed
the
on
saturday
evening
never
failed
to
be
held
their
faith
was
tried
and
true
on
sunday
afternoons
they
would
all
congregate
again
to
praise
god
and
the
congregation
was
enthusiastic
it
was
pathetic
to
hear
them
pray
from
the
depths
of
their
hearts
for
them
who
despitefully
used
them
and
persecuted
them
this
injunction
of
our
saviour
was
strictly
adhered
to
the
words
that
came
from
the
minister
were
always
of
a
consolatory
kind
he
knew
the
crosses
of
his
fellow
slaves
and
their
hardships
for
he
had
shared
them
himself
i
was
always
touched
in
hearing
him
give
out
the
hymns
i
can
hear
old
uncle
ben
now
as
he
solemnly
worded
out
the
following
lines
must
i
be
carried
to
the
skies
on
flowery
beds
of
ease
while
others
fought
to
win
the
prize
and
sailed
through
bloody
seas
after
singing
he
would
always
speak
to
them
of
the
necessity
for
patience
in
bearing
the
crosses
urging
them
to
endure
as
good
soldiers
many
tears
were
shed
and
many
glad
shouts
of
praise
would
burst
forth
during
the
sermon
a
hymn
usually
followed
the
sermon
then
all
retired
their
faces
seemed
to
shine
with
a
happy
light
their
very
countenance
showed
that
their
souls
had
been
refreshed
and
that
it
had
been
good
for
them
to
be
there
these
meetings
were
the
joy
and
comfort
of
the
slaves
and
even
those
who
did
not
profess
christianity
were
calm
and
thoughtful
while
in
attendance
a
neighborhood
quarrel
opposite
our
farm
was
one
owned
by
a
juval
and
adjoining
that
was
another
belonging
to
one
white
the
mcgees
and
the
whites
were
very
fast
friends
visiting
each
other
regularly
indeed
they
had
grown
up
together
and
white
at
one
time
was
the
lover
of
the
madam
and
engaged
to
be
married
to
her
this
friendship
had
existed
for
years
when
mcgee
bought
the
juval
farm
for
which
white
had
also
been
negotiating
but
which
he
failed
to
get
on
account
of
mcgee
having
him
from
this
circumstance
ill
feeling
was
engendered
between
the
two
men
and
they
soon
became
bitter
enemies
mcgee
had
decided
to
build
a
fence
between
the
farm
he
had
purchased
and
that
of
white
and
during
the
winter
his
teamsters
were
set
to
hauling
the
rails
and
in
unloading
them
they
accidentally
threw
some
of
them
over
the
line
on
to
white
land
the
latter
said
nothing
about
the
matter
until
spring
when
he
wrote
mcgee
a
letter
asking
him
to
remove
the
rails
from
his
land
mcgee
paid
no
attention
to
the
request
and
he
soon
received
a
second
note
when
he
said
to
his
wife
that
fellow
is
about
to
turn
himself
a
fool
i
give
him
a
a
third
and
more
emphatic
note
followed
in
which
white
told
the
boss
that
the
rails
must
be
removed
within
hours
he
grew
indignant
and
in
true
southern
style
he
went
immediately
to
town
and
bought
arms
and
prepared
himself
for
the
fray
when
he
returned
he
had
every
hand
on
the
plantation
stop
regular
work
and
put
them
all
to
building
the
fence
i
was
of
the
number
boss
and
the
overseer
came
out
to
overlook
the
work
and
hurry
it
on
about
four
in
the
afternoon
white
put
in
an
appearance
and
came
face
to
face
with
mcgee
sitting
on
his
horse
and
having
a
double
barreled
shot
gun
lying
across
the
pummel
of
his
saddle
white
passed
on
without
saying
a
word
but
boss
yelled
at
him
hello
i
see
you
are
about
to
turn
yourself
a
d
d
fool
white
checked
up
and
began
to
swear
saying
you
are
a
coward
to
attack
an
unarmed
man
he
grew
furious
took
off
his
hat
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
saying
here
i
am
blow
me
to
h
l
and
i
have
some
one
blow
you
there
before
night
during
white
rage
he
said
i
fight
you
anywhere
fight
shot
gun
fight
or
any
other
he
called
in
his
excitement
for
his
nephew
who
was
working
on
his
farm
to
come
and
immediately
sent
him
to
billy
duncan
to
get
him
a
double
barreled
shot
gun
meantime
mcgee
appeared
on
the
scene
and
began
to
cry
begging
white
to
stop
and
allow
her
to
speak
to
him
but
he
replied
go
off
go
off
i
do
want
to
speak
to
you
boss
grew
weak
and
sick
and
through
his
excitement
was
taken
violently
ill
vomiting
as
if
he
had
taken
an
emetic
he
said
to
white
i
return
as
soon
as
i
take
my
wife
home
but
he
never
came
back
as
boss
and
the
madam
rode
off
white
came
galloping
back
and
said
to
brooks
our
overseer
if
i
am
shot
down
on
foul
play
would
you
speak
of
it
brooks
replied
no
i
do
care
to
interfere
i
do
wish
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
white
was
bloodthirsty
and
came
back
at
intervals
during
the
entire
night
where
we
were
working
to
see
if
he
could
find
boss
it
is
quite
probable
that
white
may
have
long
cherished
a
secret
grudge
against
boss
because
he
had
robbed
him
of
his
first
love
and
brooding
over
these
offenses
he
became
so
excited
as
to
be
almost
insane
had
mcgee
returned
that
night
white
would
certainly
have
shot
him
boss
became
so
uneasy
over
the
situation
that
he
sent
one
of
his
slaves
a
foreman
to
panola
county
some
miles
distant
to
mcgee
father
to
get
her
brother
a
lawyer
to
come
and
endeavor
to
effect
a
settlement
he
came
but
all
his
efforts
were
unavailing
the
men
met
at
a
magistrate
office
but
they
came
to
no
understanding
our
folks
became
dissatisfied
and
did
not
care
to
remain
longer
in
the
place
so
they
began
to
look
out
for
other
quarters
boss
finally
decided
to
buy
a
farm
in
bolivar
and
to
remove
his
family
to
memphis
where
he
secured
a
fine
place
just
outside
of

mcgee
had
decided
to
build
a
new
house
upon
the
property
which
he
had
purchased
at
memphis
and
in
august
he
sent
of
his
slaves
to
the
city
to
make
brick
for
the
structure
and
i
went
along
as
cook
after
the
bricks
were
burned
the
work
of
clearing
the
ground
for
the
buildings
was
commenced
there
were
many
large
and
beautiful
trees
that
had
to
be
taken
up
and
removed
and
when
this
work
was
completed
the
excavations
for
the
foundations
and
the
cellar
were
undertaken
all
of
this
work
was
done
by
the
slaves
the
site
was
a
beautiful
one
embracing
fourteen
acres
situated
two
miles
southeast
from
the
city
on
the
memphis
and
charleston
railroad
the
road
ran
in
front
of
the
place
and
the
boss
built
a
there
for
the
accommodation
of
himself
and
his
neighbors
which
was
named
mcgee
station
a
new
and
splendid
house
the
house
was
one
of
the
most
pretentious
in
that
region
and
was
a
year
and
a
half
in
building
it
was
two
stories
in
height
and
built
of
brick
the
exterior
surface
being
coated
with
cement
and
marked
off
in
blocks
about
two
feet
square
to
represent
stone
it
was
then
whitewashed
there
was
a
veranda
in
front
with
six
large
columns
and
above
a
balcony
on
the
back
there
were
also
a
veranda
and
a
balcony
extending
across
that
end
to
the
servants
wing
a
large
hall
led
from
front
to
rear
on
one
side
of
which
were
double
parlors
and
on
the
other
a
sitting
room
a
bedroom
and
a
dining
room
in
the
second
story
were
a
hall
and
four
rooms
similar
in
all
respects
to
those
below
and
above
these
was
a
large
attic
the
interior
woodwork
was
of
black
walnut
the
walls
were
white
and
the
centerpieces
in
the
ceilings
of
all
the
rooms
were
very
fine
being
the
work
of
an
english
artisan
who
had
been
only
a
short
time
in
this
country
this
work
was
so
superior
in
design
and
finish
to
anything
before
seen
in
that
region
that
local
artisans
were
much
excited
over
it
and
some
offered
to
purchase
the
right
to
reproduce
it
but
boss
refused
the
offer
however
some
one
while
the
house
was
finishing
helped
himself
to
the
design
and
it
was
reproduced
in
whole
or
in
part
in
other
buildings
in
the
city
this
employment
of
a
foreign
artist
was
unusual
there
and
caused
much
comment
the
parlors
were
furnished
with
mahogany
sets
the
upholstering
being
in
red
brocade
satin
the
dining
room
was
also
furnished
in
mahogany
the
bedrooms
had
mahogany
bedsteads
of
the
pattern
with
canopies
costly
which
boss
and
the
madam
had
purchased
while
traveling
in
foreign
countries
was
in
great
profusion
money
was
no
object
to
edmund
mcgee
and
he
added
every
modern
improvement
and
luxury
to
his
home
the
decorations
and
furnishings
were
throughout
of
the
most
costly
and
elegant
and
in
the
whole
of
tennessee
there
was
not
a
mansion
more
sumptuously
complete
in
all
its
appointments
or
more
palatial
in
its
general
appearance
when
all
was
finished
pictures
statuary
and
flowers
all
in
their
places
mcgee
was
brought
home
in
this
new
house
boss
opened
up
in
grand
style
everything
was
changed
and
the
family
entered
upon
a
new
more
formal
and
more
pretentious
manner
of
living
i
was
known
no
longer
as
errand
boy
but
installed
as
butler
and
to
my
master
i
had
the
same
routine
of
morning
work
only
it
was
more
extensive
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
done
in
so
spacious
a
mansion
looking
after
the
parlors
halls
and
dining
rooms
arranging
flowers
in
the
rooms
waiting
on
the
table
and
going
after
the
mail
was
my
regular
morning
work
the
year
round
then
there
were
my
duties
to
perform
night
and
morning
for
my
master
these
were
to
brush
his
clothes
black
his
shoes
assist
him
to
arrange
his
toilet
and
do
any
little
thing
that
he
wanted
me
to
aside
from
these
regular
duties
there
were
windows
to
wash
silver
to
polish
and
steps
to
stone
on
certain
days
in
the
week
i
was
called
to
do
any
errand
necessary
and
sometimes
to
assist
in
the
garden
a
new
staff
of
house
servants
was
installed
as
follows

on

celia

thomas
coachman
the
new
style
of
living
the
servants
at
first
were
dazed
with
the
splendor
of
the
new
house
and
laughed
and
chuckled
to
themselves
a
good
deal
about
mars
fine
house
and
really
seemed
pleased
for
strange
to
say
the
slaves
of
rich
people
always
rejoiced
in
that
fact
a
servant
owned
by
a
man
in
moderate
circumstances
was
hooted
at
by
rich
men
slaves
it
was
common
for
them
to
say
oh
do
mind
that
darkey
he
belongs
to
white
trash
so
as
i
said
our
slaves
rejoiced
in
master
good
luck
each
of
the
women
servants
wore
a
new
gay
colored
turban
which
was
tied
differently
from
that
of
the
ordinary
servant
in
some
fancy
knot
their
frocks
and
aprons
were
new
and
really
the
servants
themselves
looked
new
my
outfit
was
a
new
cloth
suit
and
my
aprons
for
wearing
when
waiting
on
the
table
were
of
snowy
white
linen
the
style
being
copied
from
that
of
the
new
york
waiters
i
felt
big
for
i
never
knew
what
a
white
bosom
shirt
was
before
and
even
though
the
grief
at
the
separation
from
my
dear
mother
was
almost
unbearable
at
times
and
my
sense
of
loneliness
in
having
no
relative
near
me
often
made
me
sad
there
was
consolation
if
not
compensation
in
this
little
change
i
had
known
no
comforts
and
had
been
so
cowed
and
broken
in
spirits
by
cruel
lashings
that
i
really
felt
at
this
improvement
in
my
personal
appearance
although
it
was
merely
for
the
gratification
of
my
master
pride
and
i
thought
i
would
do
all
i
could
to
please
boss
the
adornment
of
the
grounds
for
some
time
before
all
the
appointments
of
the
new
home
were
completed
a
great
number
of
mechanics
and
workmen
besides
our
own
servants
were
employed
and
there
was
much
bustle
and
stir
about
the
premises
considerable
work
was
yet
to
be
done
fences
to
be
made
gardens
and
orchards
to
be
arranged
and
planted
and
the
grounds
about
the
house
to
be
laid
out
and
adorned
with
shrubbery
and
flower
beds
when
this
work
was
finally
accomplished
the
grounds
were
indeed
beautiful
the
walks
were
graveled
and
led
through
a
profusion
of
shrubbery
and
flower
beds
there
was
almost
every
variety
of
roses
while
scattered
over
the
grounds
there
were
spruce
pine
and
juniper
trees
and
some
rare
varieties
seldom
seen
in
this
northern
climate
around
the
grounds
was
set
a
cedar
hedge
and
in
time
the
place
became
noted
for
the
beauty
of
its
shrubbery
the
roses
especially
were
marvelous
in
the
richness
and
variety
of
their
colors
their
fragrance
and
the
luxuriousness
of
their
growth
people
who
have
never
traveled
in
the
south
have
little
idea
of
the
richness
and
profusion
of
its
flowers
especially
of
its
roses
among
the
climbing
plants
which
adorned
the
house
the
most
beautiful
and
fragrant
was
the
african
honeysuckle
its
odor
was
indeed
delightful
the
garden
one
of
the
institutions
of
the
place
was
the
vegetable
garden
this
was
established
not
only
for
the
convenience
and
comfort
of
the
family
but
to
furnish
employment
for
the
slaves
under
the
care
of
uncle
gooden
the
gardener
it
flourished
greatly
and
there
was
so
much
more
produced
than
the
family
could
use
boss
concluded
to
sell
the
surplus
the
gardener
therefore
went
to
the
city
every
morning
with
a
load
of
vegetables
which
brought
from
eight
to
ten
dollars
daily
and
this
the
madam
took
for
pin
money
in
the
spring
i
had
always
to
help
the
gardener
in
setting
out
plants
and
preparing
beds
and
as
this
was
in
connection
with
my
other
work
i
became
so
tired
sometimes
that
i
could
hardly
stand
all
the
vegetables
raised
were
fine
and
at
that
time
brought
a
good
price
the
first
cabbage
that
we
sold
in
the
markets
brought
cents
a
head
the
first
sweet
potatoes
marketed
always
brought
a
dollar
a
peck
or
four
dollars
a
bushel
the
memphis
market
regulations
required
that
all
vegetables
be
washed
before
being
exposed
for
sale
corn
was
husked
and
everything
was
clean
and
inviting
any
one
found
guilty
of
selling
or
exhibiting
for
sale
vegetables
of
a
previous
day
was
fined
at
once
by
the
market
master
this
rule
was
carried
out
to
the
letter
nothing
stale
could
be
sold
or
even
come
into
market
the
rules
required
that
all
poultry
be
dressed
before
being
brought
to
market
the
entrails
were
cleaned
and
strung
and
sold
separately
usually
for
about
ten
cents
a
string
profusion
of
flowers
flowers
grew
in
profusion
everywhere
through
the
south
and
it
has
properly
been
called
the
land
of
flowers
but
flowers
had
no
such
sale
there
as
have
our
flowers
here
in
the
north
the
pansy
and
many
of
our
highly
prized
plants
and
flowers
grew
wild
in
the
south
the
people
there
did
not
seem
to
care
for
flowers
as
we
do
i
have
sold
many
bouquets
for
a
dime
and
very
beautiful
ones
for
fifteen
and
twenty
cents
that
would
sell
in
the
north
for
fifty
to
cents
the
fruit
orchard
the
new
place
had
an
orchard
of
about
four
acres
consisting
of
a
variety
of
apple
peach
pear
and
plum
trees
boss
hired
an
expert
gardener
to
teach
me
the
art
of
grafting
and
after
some
practice
i
became
quite
skilled
in
this
work
some
of
the
pear
trees
that
had
been
grafted
had
three
different
kinds
of
fruit
on
them
and
others
had
three
kinds
of
apples
on
them
besides
the
pears
this
grafting
i
did
myself
and
the
trees
were
considered
very
fine
by
boss
another
part
of
my
work
was
the
trimming
of
the
hedge
and
the
care
of
all
the
shrubbery
i
practice
medicine
among
the
slaves
mcgee
had
a
medicine
chest
built
into
the
wall
of
the
new
house
the
shelves
for
medicine
were
of
wood
and
the
arrangement
was
very
convenient
it
was
really
a
small
drug
store
it
contained
everything
in
the
way
of
drugs
that
was
necessary
to
use
in
doctoring
the
slaves
we
had
quinine
alcohol
and
ipecac
in
great
quantities
as
these
were
the
principal
drugs
used
in
the
limited
practice
in
the
home
establishment
if
a
servant
came
from
the
field
to
the
house
with
a
chill
which
was
frequent
the
first
thing
we
did
was
to
give
him
a
dose
of
ipecac
to
vomit
him
on
the
evening
after
we
would
give
him
two
or
three
of
cook
pills
these
pills
we
made
at
home
i
always
had
to
prepare
the
medicines
and
give
the
dose
the
boss
standing
by
dictating
working
with
medicine
giving
it
and
caring
for
the
sick
were
the
parts
of
my
work
that
i
liked
best
boss
used
gunn
book
altogether
for
recipes
in
putting
up
medicines
he
read
me
the
recipe
while
i
compounded
it
a
swell
reception
in
celebration
of
the
opening
of
the
new
house
mcgee
gave
an
elaborate
reception
and
dinner
the
menu
embraced
nearly
everything
that
one
could
think
of
or
desire
and
all
in
the
greatest
profusion
it
was
a
custom
not
only
with
the
mcgees
but
among
the
southern
people
generally
to
make
much
of
eating
it
was
one
of
their
hobbies
everything
was
cooked
well
and
highly
seasoned
scarcity
was
foreign
to
the
homes
of
the
wealthy
southerners
relatives
visit
at
the
mansion
after
the
family
had
been
settled
about
a
month
in
the
new
home
their
relatives
in
panola
jack
mcgee
known
among
the
servants
as
old
jack
melinda
mcgee
his
wife
farrington
their
daughter
who
was
a
widow
and
their
other
children
louisa
ella
and
william
all
came
up
for
a
visit
and
to
see
the
wonderful
house
jack
mcgee
was
the
father
of
madam
and
the
uncle
of
boss
my
master
and
mistress
were
therefore
first
cousins
and
boss
sometimes
called
the
old
man
father
and
at
other
times
uncle
old
master
jack
as
he
alighted
said
to
those
behind
him
now
be
careful
step
lightly
louisa
this
is
the
finest
house
you
ever
set
foot
in
when
all
had
come
into
the
house
and
the
old
man
had
begun
to
look
around
he
said
i
do
know
what
edmund
is
thinking
to
build
such
a
he
was
very
old
and
had
never
lost
all
of
his
scotch
dialect
and
he
had
a
habit
of
repeating
a
part
or
all
of
some
words
as
in
the
foregoing
quotation
the
other
members
of
the
visiting
family
were
well
pleased
with
the
house
and
said
it
was
grand
they
laughed
and
talked
merrily
over
the
many
novel
things
which
they
saw
farrington
who
was
a
gay
widow
was
naturally
interested
in
everything
i
busied
myself
waiting
upon
them
and
it
was
late
that
night
before
i
was
through
so
many
made
extra
work
for
me
one
of
the
visitors
distrusts
me
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
boss
and
old
master
jack
went
out
to
view
the
grounds
they
took
me
along
so
that
if
anything
was
wanted
i
could
do
it
boss
would
have
me
drive
a
stake
in
some
place
to
mark
where
he
desired
to
put
something
perhaps
some
flowers
or
a
tree
he
went
on
through
the
grounds
showing
his
father
how
everything
was
to
be
arranged
the
old
man
shook
his
head
and
said
well
it
good
but
i
am
afraid
you
spoil
these
keep
you
eye
on
that
boy
lou
meaning
me
he
is
too
oh
manage
that
father
said
boss
well
see
that
you
for
i
see
running
away
in
his
eyes
one
of
the
things
that
interested
old
master
jack
was
the
ringing
of
the
dinner
bell
well
i
do
think
said
the
old
man
that
boy
can
ring
a
bell
better
than
anybody
i
ever
heard
why
its
got
a
regular
tune
i
used
to
try
to
see
how
near
i
could
come
to
making
it
say
come
to
dinner
the
madam
in
a
rage
the
four
days
soon
passed
and
all
the
company
gone
we
were
once
more
at
our
regular
work
delia
the
cook
seemingly
had
not
pleased
the
madam
in
her
cooking
while
the
company
were
there
so
the
morning
after
they
left
she
went
toward
the
kitchen
calling
delia
delia
delia
said
dah
i
wonder
what
she
wants
now
by
this
time
she
was
in
the
kitchen
confronting
delia
her
face
was
flushed
as
she
screamed
out
what
kind
of
biscuits
were
those
you
baked
this
week
i
think
they
were
all
right
mis
sarh
hush
screamed
out
the
madam
stamping
her
foot
to
make
it
more
emphatic
you
did
not
half
cook
them
said
she
they
were
not
beat
enough
those
waffles
were
ridiculous
said
the
madam
well
mis
sarh
i
tried
stop
cried
madam
in
a
rage
i
give
you
thunder
if
you
dictate
to
me
not
a
very
elegant
display
in
language
or
manner
for
a
great
lady
old
aunt
delia
who
was
used
to
these
occurrences
said
my
lord
dat
woman
dunno
what
she
wants
ah
lou
there
is
nothing
but
the
devil
up
here
meaning
the
new
home
ca
do
nothin
to
please
her
up
here
in
dis
fine
house
i
tell
you
satan
neber
git
his
own
til
he
git
her
they
did
not
use
baking
powder
as
we
do
now
but
the
biscuits
were
beaten
until
light
enough
twenty
minutes
was
the
time
allotted
for
this
work
but
when
company
came
there
was
so
much
to
be
done
so
many
more
dishes
to
prepare
that
delia
would
perhaps
not
have
so
much
time
for
each
meal
but
there
was
no
allowance
made
it
was
never
thought
reasonable
that
a
servant
should
make
a
mistake
things
must
always
be
the
same
i
was
listening
to
this
quarrel
between
madam
and
delia
supposing
my
time
would
come
next
but
for
that
once
she
said
nothing
to
me
the
madam
severity
mcgee
was
naturally
irritable
servants
always
got
an
extra
whipping
when
she
had
any
personal
trouble
as
though
they
could
help
it
every
morning
little
kate
aunt
delia
little
girl
would
have
to
go
with
the
madam
on
her
rounds
to
the
different
buildings
of
the
establishment
to
carry
the
key
basket
so
many
were
the
keys
that
they
were
kept
in
a
basket
especially
provided
for
them
and
the
child
was
its
regular
bearer
the
madam
with
this
little
attendant
was
everywhere
in
the
barn
in
the
hennery
in
the
smokehouse
and
she
always
made
trouble
with
the
servants
wherever
she
went
indeed
she
rarely
returned
to
the
house
from
these
rounds
without
having
whipped
two
or
three
servants
whether
there
was
really
any
cause
for
the
punishment
or
not
she
seldom
let
a
day
pass
without
beating
some
poor
woman
unmercifully
the
number
and
severity
of
these
whippings
depended
more
upon
the
humor
of
the
madam
than
upon
the
conduct
of
the
slaves
of
course
i
always
came
in
for
a
share
in
this
brutal
treatment
she
continued
her
old
habit
of
boxing
my
jaws
pinching
my
ears
no
day
ever
passing
without
her
indulging
in
this
exercise
of
her
physical
powers
so
long
had
i
endured
this
i
came
to
expect
it
no
matter
how
well
i
did
my
duties
and
it
had
its
natural
effect
upon
me
making
me
a
coward
even
though
i
was
now
growing
into
manhood
i
remember
once
in
particular
when
i
had
tried
to
please
her
by
arranging
the
parlor
i
overheard
her
say
they
soon
get
spirit
it
do
do
to
praise
servants
my
heart
sank
within
me
what
good
was
it
for
me
to
try
to
please
she
would
find
fault
anyway
her
usual
morning
greeting
was
well
lou
have
you
dusted
the
parlors
oh
yes
i
would
answer
have
the
flowers
been
arranged
yes
all
is
in
readiness
i
would
say
once
i
had
stoned
the
steps
as
usual
but
the
madam
grew
angry
as
soon
as
she
saw
them
i
had
labored
hard
and
thought
she
would
be
pleased
the
result
however
was
very
far
from
that
she
took
me
out
stripped
me
of
my
shirt
and
began
thrashing
me
saying
i
was
spoiled
i
was
no
longer
a
child
but
old
enough
to
be
treated
differently
i
began
to
cry
for
it
seemed
to
me
my
heart
would
break
but
after
the
first
burst
of
tears
the
feeling
came
over
me
that
i
was
a
man
and
it
was
an
outrage
to
treat
me
so
to
keep
me
under
the
lash
day
after
day
a
shocking
accident
not
long
after
farrington
had
made
her
first
visit
to
our
house
she
came
there
to
live
celia
had
been
acting
as
her
maid
when
farrington
had
been
up
some
months
it
was
decided
that
all
the
family
should
go
down
to
old
master
jack
for
a
visit
celia
the
maid
had
been
so
hurried
in
the
preparations
for
this
visit
that
she
had
done
nothing
for
herself
the
night
before
the
family
was
to
leave
therefore
she
was
getting
ready
a
garment
for
herself
to
wear
on
the
trip
and
it
was
supposed
that
she
sewed
until
midnight
or
after
when
she
fell
asleep
letting
the
goods
fall
into
the
candle
all
at
once
a
little
after
twelve
i
heard
a
scream
then
a
cry
of
fire
fire
and
boss
yelling
louis
louis
i
jumped
up
throwing
an
old
coat
over
me
and
ran
up
stairs
in
the
direction
of
room
i
encountered
boss
in
the
hall
and
as
it
was
dark
and
the
smoke
stifling
i
could
hardly
make
any
headway
at
this
moment
farrington
threw
her
door
open
and
screamed
for
cousin
eddie
meaning
mcgee
he
hurriedly
called
to
me
to
get
a
pitcher
of
water
quick
i
grasped
the
pitcher
from
the
stand
and
he
attempted
to
throw
the
water
on
celia
who
was
all
in
a
blaze
running
around
like
a
mad
woman
but
the
pitcher
slipped
from
his
hand
and
broke
very
little
of
the
water
reaching
her
she
was
at
last
wrapped
in
an
old
blanket
to
extinguish
the
flames
but
she
was
burned
too
badly
to
recover
boss
being
a
physician
said
at
once
poor
girl
poor
girl
she
is
burned
to
death
he
did
all
he
could
for
her
wrapped
her
in
linen
sheets
and
endeavored
to
relieve
her
sufferings
but
all
was
of
no
avail
she
had
inhaled
the
flame
injuring
her
internally
and
lived
only
a
few
days
master
new
cotton
plantation
shortly
after
boss
bought
his
home
in
memphis
he
bought
a
large
farm
in
bolivar
miss
it
was
a
regular
cotton
farm
on
the
mississippi
river
embracing
acres
the
houses
built
for
the
slaves
were
frame
eighteen
in
number
each
to
contain
three
or
four
families
and
arranged
on
each
side
of
a
street
that
ran
through
the
farm
this
street
was
all
grassed
over
but
there
were
no
sidewalks
all
the
buildings
the
barn
slaves
quarters
and
overseers
house
were
whitewashed
and
on
this
street
they
made
a
neat
and
pretty
appearance
the
house
where
the
boss
and
the
madam
staid
when
they
went
down
to
the
farm
was
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
slaves
quarters
it
was
arranged
in
two
apartments
one
for
the
overseer
and
wife
and
the
other
for
the
master
and
mistress
upon
the
occasion
of
their
visits
this
building
was
separated
from
the
other
buildings
by
a
fence
there
was
what
was
called
the
cook
house
where
was
cooked
all
the
food
for
the
hands
aunt
matilda
was
cook
in
charge
besides
the
buildings
already
named
there
were
stables
a
blacksmith
shop
and
sawmill
and
the
general
order
of
arrangement
was
carried
out
with
respect
to
all
the
appearance
was
that
of
a
village
everything
was
raised
in
abundance
to
last
from
one
crop
to
the
next
vegetables
and
meat
were
provided
from
the
farm
and
a
dairy
of
fifty
cows
furnished
all
the
milk
and
butter
needed
the
cane
brakes
were
so
heavy
that
it
was
common
for
bears
to
hide
there
and
at
night
come
out
and
carry
off
hogs
wolves
were
plenty
in
the
woods
behind
the
farm
and
could
be
heard
at
any
time
the
cane
was
so
thick
that
when
they
were
clearing
up
new
ground
it
would
have
to
be
set
on
fire
and
the
cracking
that
would
ensue
was
like
the
continuous
explosion
of
small
fire
crackers
about
one
hundred
and
sixty
slaves
besides
children
all
owned
by
mcgee
were
worked
on
the
farm
instead
of
ginning
two
or
three
bales
of
cotton
a
day
as
at
pontotoc
they
ginned
six
to
seven
bales
here
incidents
i
remember
well
the
time
when
the
great
swedish
singer
jenny
lind
came
to
memphis
it
was
during
her
famous
tour
through
america
in
our
folks
were
all
enthused
over
her
boss
went
in
and
secured
tickets
to
her
concert
and
i
was
summoned
to
drive
them
to
the
hall
it
was
a
great
event
people
swarmed
the
streets
like
bees
the
carriages
and
hacks
were
stacked
back
from
the
hall
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
on
another
occasion
when
the
great
prodigy
blind
tom
came
to
memphis
there
was
a
similar
stir
among
the
people
tom
was
very
young
then
and
he
was
called
the
blind
boy
people
came
from
far
and
near
to
hear
him
those
coming
from
the
villages
and
small
towns
who
could
not
get
passage
on
the
regular
trains
came
in
freight
or
on
flat
bottom
cars
the
tickets
were
each
as
i
remember
boss
said
it
was
expensive
but
all
must
hear
this
boy
pianist
many
were
the
comments
on
this
boy
of
such
wonderful
talents
as
i
drove
our
people
home
they
seemed
to
talk
of
nothing
else
they
declared
that
he
was
indeed
a
wonder
longing
for
freedom
sometimes
when
the
farm
hands
were
at
work
peddlers
would
come
along
and
as
they
were
treated
badly
by
the
rich
planters
they
hated
them
and
talked
to
the
slaves
in
a
way
to
excite
them
and
set
them
thinking
of
freedom
they
would
say
encouragingly
to
them
ah
you
will
be
free
some
day
but
the
slaves
some
of
whom
were
bowed
with
age
with
frosted
hair
and
furrowed
cheek
would
answer
looking
up
from
their
work
we
do
blieve
dat
my
grandfather
said
we
was
to
be
free
but
we
aint
free
yet
it
had
been
talked
of
this
freedom
from
generation
to
generation
perhaps
they
would
not
have
thought
of
freedom
if
their
owners
had
not
been
so
cruel
had
my
mistress
been
more
kind
to
me
i
should
have
thought
less
of
liberty
i
know
the
cruel
treatment
which
i
received
was
the
main
thing
that
made
me
wish
to
be
free
besides
this
it
was
inhuman
to
separate
families
as
they
did
think
of
a
mother
being
sold
from
all
her
children
separated
for
life
this
separation
was
common
and
many
died
by
reason
of
it
ah
i
can
not
forget
the
cruel
separation
from
my
mother
i
know
not
what
became
of
her
but
i
have
always
believed
her
dead
many
years
ago
hundreds
were
separated
as
my
mother
and
i
were
and
never
met
again
though
freedom
was
yearned
for
by
some
because
the
treatment
was
so
bad
others
who
were
bright
and
had
looked
into
the
matter
knew
it
was
a
curse
to
be
held
a
slave
they
longed
to
stand
out
in
true
manhood
allowed
to
express
their
opinions
as
were
white
men
others
still
desired
freedom
thinking
they
could
then
reclaim
a
wife
or
husband
or
children
the
mother
would
again
see
her
child
all
these
promptings
of
the
heart
made
them
yearn
for
freedom
new
year
was
always
a
time
for
it
was
then
the
slaves
were
bought
and
sold
and
they
stood
in
constant
fear
of
losing
some
one
dear
to
them
a
child
a
husband
or
wife
my
first
break
for
freedom
in
the
new
home
my
duties
were
harder
than
ever
the
mcgees
held
me
with
tighter
grip
and
it
was
nothing
but
cruel
abuse
from
morning
till
night
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
try
and
run
away
to
a
free
country
i
used
to
hear
boss
read
sometimes
in
the
papers
about
runaway
slaves
who
had
gone
to
canada
and
it
always
made
me
long
to
go
yet
i
never
appeared
as
if
i
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
what
the
family
read
or
said
on
such
matters
but
i
felt
that
i
could
be
like
others
and
try
at
least
to
get
away
one
morning
when
boss
had
gone
to
town
madam
had
threatened
to
whip
me
and
told
me
to
come
to
the
house
when
she
called
me
i
did
not
go
but
went
off
down
through
the
garden
and
through
the
woods
and
made
my
way
for
the
city
when
i
got
into
memphis
i
found
at
the
landing
a
boat
called
the
statesman
and
i
sneaked
aboard
it
was
not
expected
that
the
boat
would
stay
more
than
a
few
hours
but
for
some
reason
it
stayed
all
night
the
boat
was
loaded
with
sugar
and
i
hid
myself
behind
four
hogsheads
i
could
see
both
engineers
one
each
side
of
me
when
night
came
on
i
crept
out
from
my
hiding
place
and
went
forward
to
search
for
food
and
water
for
i
was
thirsty
and
very
hungry
i
found
the
table
where
the
deck
hands
had
been
eating
and
managed
to
get
a
little
food
left
from
their
meal
and
some
water
this
was
by
no
means
enough
but
i
had
to
be
content
and
went
back
to
my
place
of
concealment
i
had
been
on
board
the
boat
three
days
and
on
the
third
night
when
i
came
out
to
hunt
food
the
second
mate
saw
me
in
a
minute
he
eyed
me
over
and
said
why
i
have
a
reward
for
you
in
a
second
he
had
me
go
up
stairs
to
the
captain
this
raised
a
great
excitement
among
the
passengers
and
in
a
minute
i
was
besieged
with
numerous
questions
some
spoke
as
if
they
were
sorry
for
me
and
said
if
they
had
known
i
was
a
poor
runaway
slave
they
would
have
slipped
me
ashore
the
whole
boat
was
in
alarm
it
seemed
to
me
they
were
consulting
slips
of
paper
one
said
yes
he
is
the
same
listen
how
this
reads
ran
away
from
edmund
mcgee
my
mulatto
boy
louis
feet
inches
in
height
black
hair
is
very
bright
and
intelligent
will
give
for
him
alive
and
half
of
this
amount
for
knowledge
that
he
has
been
killed
my
heart
sprang
into
my
throat
when
i
heard
two
men
read
this
advertisement
i
knew
at
once
what
it
all
meant
remembering
how
often
i
had
heard
boss
read
such
articles
from
the
papers
and
from
the
handbills
that
were
distributed
through
the
city
the
captain
asked
me
if
i
could
dance
it
seemed
he
felt
sorry
for
me
for
he
said
that
a
bright
boy
to
be
a
slave
then
turning
to
me
he
said
come
give
us
a
dance
i
was
young
and
nimble
so
i
danced
a
few
of
the
old
southern
clog
dances
and
sang
one
or
two
songs
like
this
come
along
sam
the
fifer
son
aint
you
mighty
glad
your
day
work
done
after
i
finished
singing
and
dancing
the
captain
took
up
a
collection
for
me
and
got
about
two
dollars
this
cheered
me
a
good
deal
i
knew
that
i
would
need
money
if
i
should
ever
succeed
in
getting
on
on
the
following
evening
when
we
reached
west
franklin
indiana
while
the
passengers
were
at
tea
another
boat
pushed
into
port
right
after
ours
immediately
a
gentleman
passenger
came
to
me
hurriedly
and
whispered
to
me
to
go
down
stairs
jump
out
on
the
bow
of
the
other
boat
and
go
ashore
i
was
alarmed
but
obeyed
for
i
felt
that
he
was
a
friend
to
slaves
i
went
out
as
quietly
as
i
could
and
was
not
missed
until
i
had
gotten
on
shore
then
i
heard
the
alarm
given
that
the
boy
was
gone
that
the
runaway
was
gone
but
i
sped
on
and
did
not
stop
until
i
had
run
through
the
village
and
had
come
to
a
road
that
led
right
into
the
country
i
took
this
road
and
went
on
until
i
had
gone
four
or
five
miles
when
i
came
to
a
farm
house
before
reaching
it
however
i
met
two
men
on
horseback
on
their
way
to
the
village
they
passed
on
without
specially
noticing
me
and
i
kept
on
my
way
until
reaching
the
farmhouse
i
was
so
hungry
i
went
in
and
asked
for
food
while
i
was
eating
the
men
whom
i
had
met
rode
up
they
had
been
to
the
village
and
learning
that
a
runaway
slave
was
wanted
and
remembering
meeting
me
they
returned
in
hot
haste
in
hope
of
finding
me
and
securing
the
reward
they
hallooed
to
the
people
in
the
house
an
old
woman
and
her
daughter
whom
they
seemed
to
know
saying
there
is
a
runaway
nigger
out
who
stole
off
a
boat
this
evening
the
old
lady
said
come
becoming
frightened
at
once
when
they
came
in
they
began
to
question
me
i
trembled
all
over
but
answered
them
they
said
you
are
the
fellow
we
want
who
ran
off
the
boat
i
was
too
scared
to
deny
it
so
i
owned
i
was
on
the
boat
and
stole
off
they
did
not
tarry
long
but
taking
me
with
them
they
went
about
a
mile
and
a
half
to
their
house
they
planned
and
talked
all
the
way
and
one
said
we
are
good
for
for
him
any
way
the
next
morning
they
took
me
into
the
village
they
soon
found
out
that
the
engineer
by
order
of
the
captain
had
stayed
over
to
search
for
me
a
lawsuit
followed
and
i
was
taken
before
the
magistrate
before
the
engineer
could
get
possession
of
me
there
was
a
legal
course
that
had
to
be
gone
through
with
a
lawyer
fox
by
name
furnished
the
for
the
men
who
had
caught
me
that
part
of
the
case
being
settled
fox
and
the
engineer
started
for
evansville
that
same
night
upon
arriving
there
fox
received
from
the
captain
of
the
boat
the
money
he
had
advanced
to
the
men
who
caught
me
and
we
went
on
arriving
at
louisville
the
next
day
i
was
then
taken
again
before
a
magistrate
by
the
captain
when
the
following
statement
was
read
by
that
official
captain
montgomery
brought
forth
a
boy
and
said
he
is
the
property
of
edmund
mcgee
of
memphis
come
forth
owner
and
prove
property
for
after
the
boy
shall
remain
in
jail
six
months
he
shall
be
sold
to
pay
jail
feed
mcgee
was
informed
of
my
whereabouts
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
and
his
cousin
came
to
get
me
when
they
came
i
was
called
up
by
the
nickname
they
had
given
me
memphis
come
out
here
said
the
turnkey
your
master
has
come
for
you
i
went
down
stairs
to
the
office
and
found
boss
waiting
for
me
hello
lou
said
he
what
are
you
doing
here
you
dog
i
was
so
frightened
i
said
nothing
of
course
some
few
words
were
passed
between
him
and
the
officers
i
heard
him
say
that
i
was
a
smart
fellow
and
he
could
not
tell
why
i
had
run
away
that
he
had
always
treated
me
well
this
was
to
impress
the
officers
with
the
idea
that
he
was
not
unkind
to
his
slaves
the
all
hated
to
be
classed
as
bad
taskmasters
yet
nearly
all
of
them
were
the
clothes
i
wore
were
jail
property
and
he
could
not
take
me
away
in
them
so
we
started
to
go
up
town
to
get
others
as
we
passed
out
the
jailer
buckhanon
said
ai
you
going
to
put
on
him
oh
no
said
boss
after
i
was
taken
to
the
store
and
fitted
with
a
new
suit
of
clothes
he
brought
me
back
to
the
jail
where
i
washed
myself
and
put
on
the
new
garments
when
all
was
complete
and
i
seemed
to
suit
master
fastidious
eye
he
took
me
to
the
gault
house
where
he
was
stopping
in
the
evening
we
started
for
home
and
reached
memphis
the
following
day
boss
did
not
flog
me
as
i
expected
but
sent
me
to
my
regular
routine
work
we
had
been
in
this
new
home
so
short
a
time
he
did
not
want
it
to
be
rumored
that
he
whipped
his
slaves
he
was
so
stylish
and
rich
but
the
madam
was
filled
with
rage
although
she
did
not
say
much
i
think
they
saw
that
i
was
no
longer
a
child
they
feared
i
would
go
again
but
after
i
had
been
home
some
three
or
four
weeks
madam
sarah
commenced
her
old
tricks
attempting
to
whip
me
box
my
jaws
and
pinch
me
if
any
little
thing
was
not
pleasing
to
her
at
meal
time
it
was
a
special
delight
for
her
to
reach
out
when
i
drew
near
to
her
to
pass
something
and
give
me
a
blow
with
her
hand
truly
it
was
a
monstrous
domestic
institution
that
not
only
tolerated
but
fostered
such
an
exhibition
of
table
manners
by
a
fine
lady
such
vulgar
spite
and
cruelty
my
second
runaway
trip
about
three
months
after
my
first
attempt
to
get
away
i
thought
i
would
try
it
again
i
went
to
memphis
and
saw
a
boat
at
the
landing
called
the
john
lirozey
a
cincinnati
packet
this
boat
carried
the
mail
she
had
come
into
port
in
the
morning
and
was
being
unloaded
i
went
aboard
in
the
afternoon
and
jumped
down
into
the
hull
boss
had
been
there
in
the
fore
part
of
the
afternoon
inquiring
for
me
but
i
did
not
know
it
then
after
i
had
been
in
the
boat
some
time
the
men
commenced
loading
it
i
crept
up
in
the
corner
and
hid
myself
at
first
two
or
three
hundred
dry
and
green
hides
were
thrown
in
and
these
hid
me
but
later
on
two
or
three
tiers
of
cotton
bales
were
put
in
the
center
of
the
hull
and
when
the
boat
started
i
got
upon
the
top
of
these
and
lay
there
i
could
hear
the
people
talking
above
me
but
it
was
so
dark
i
could
not
see
anything
it
was
dark
as
a
dungeon
i
had
lain
there
two
nights
and
began
to
get
so
weak
and
faint
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
for
some
reason
the
boat
did
not
start
the
day
i
went
aboard
consequently
i
had
not
gotten
as
far
from
home
as
i
expected
and
my
privations
had
largely
been
in
vain
despairing
and
hungry
on
the
third
day
i
commenced
howling
and
screaming
hoping
that
some
one
would
hear
me
and
come
to
my
relief
for
almost
anything
else
would
have
been
preferable
to
the
privation
and
hunger
from
which
i
was
suffering
but
i
could
make
no
one
hear
at
least
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
my
screams
if
they
did
hear
in
the
evening
however
one
of
the
deck
hands
came
in
with
a
lantern
to
look
around
and
see
everything
was
all
right
i
saw
the
light
and
followed
him
out
but
i
had
been
out
of
my
hiding
only
a
short
time
when
i
was
discovered
by
a
man
who
took
me
up
stairs
to
the
captain
it
was
an
effort
for
me
to
walk
up
stairs
as
i
was
weak
and
faint
having
neither
eaten
nor
drank
anything
for
three
days
this
boat
was
crowded
with
passengers
and
it
was
soon
a
scene
of
confusion
i
was
placed
in
the
pilot
room
for
safety
until
we
arrived
at
a
small
town
in
kentucky
called
monroe
i
was
put
off
here
to
be
kept
until
the
packet
came
back
from
cincinnati
then
i
was
carried
back
to
memphis
arriving
about
one
at
night
and
for
safe
keeping
was
put
into
what
was
called
the
calaboose
this
was
especially
for
the
keeping
of
slaves
who
had
run
away
and
been
caught
word
was
sent
to
boss
of
my
capture
and
the
next
morning
thomas
bland
a
fellow
servant
of
mine
was
sent
to
take
me
home
i
can
not
tell
how
i
felt
for
the
only
thought
that
came
to
me
was
that
i
should
get
killed
the
madam
met
us
as
we
drove
into
the
yard
ah
she
said
to
me
you
put
up
at
the
wrong
hotel
sir
i
was
taken
to
the
barn
where
stocks
had
been
prepared
beside
which
were
a
cowhide
and
a
pail
of
salt
water
all
prepared
for
me
it
was
terrible
but
there
was
no
escape
i
was
fastened
in
the
stocks
my
clothing
removed
and
the
whipping
began
boss
whipped
me
a
while
then
he
sat
down
and
read
his
paper
after
which
the
whipping
was
resumed
this
continued
for
two
hours
fastened
as
i
was
in
the
stocks
i
could
only
stand
and
take
lash
after
lash
as
long
as
he
desired
the
terrible
rawhide
cutting
into
my
flesh
at
every
stroke
then
he
used
peach
tree
switches
which
cracked
the
flesh
so
the
blood
oozed
out
after
this
came
the
paddle
two
and
a
half
feet
long
and
three
inches
wide
salt
and
water
was
at
once
applied
to
wash
the
wounds
and
the
smarting
was
maddening
this
torture
was
common
among
the
southern
planters
god
only
knows
what
i
suffered
under
it
all
and
he
alone
gave
me
strength
to
endure
it
i
could
hardly
move
after
the
terrible
ordeal
was
finished
and
could
scarcely
bear
my
clothes
to
touch
me
at
first
so
sore
was
my
whole
body
and
it
was
weeks
before
i
was
myself
again
preaching
to
the
slaves
as
an
offset
probably
to
such
diabolical
cruelties
as
those
which
were
practiced
upon
me
in
common
with
nearly
all
the
slaves
in
the
cotton
region
of
the
south
it
was
the
custom
in
the
section
of
country
where
i
lived
to
have
the
white
minister
preach
to
the
servants
sunday
afternoon
after
the
morning
service
for
the
whites
the
white
people
hired
the
minister
by
the
year
to
preach
for
them
at
their
church
then
he
had
to
preach
to
each
master
slaves
in
turn
the
circuit
was
made
once
a
month
but
there
was
service
of
some
kind
every
sunday
the
slaves
on
some
places
gathered
in
the
yard
at
others
in
the
white
folks
school
houses
and
they
all
seemed
pleased
and
eager
to
hear
the
word
of
god
it
was
a
strong
evidence
of
their
native
intelligence
and
discrimination
that
they
could
discern
the
difference
between
the
truths
of
the
word
and
the
professed
practice
of
those
truths
by
their
masters
my
boss
took
pride
in
having
all
his
slaves
look
clean
and
tidy
at
the
sabbath
service
but
how
would
he
have
liked
to
have
the
slaves
with
backs
lacerated
with
the
lash
appear
in
those
assemblies
with
their
wounds
uncovered
the
question
can
never
be
answered
the
master
and
most
of
his
victims
have
gone
where
professions
of
righteousness
will
not
avail
to
cover
the
barbarities
practised
here
a
family
of
free
persons
sold
into
slavery
my
wife
matilda
was
born
in
fayette
county
kentucky
june
it
seems
that
her
mother
and
her
seven
children
were
to
have
been
free
according
to
the
old
pennsylvania
law
there
were
two
uncles
of
the
family
who
were
also
to
have
been
free
but
who
had
been
kept
over
time
so
they
sued
for
their
freedom
and
gained
it
the
lawyers
in
the
case
were
abolitionists
and
friends
to
the
slaves
and
saw
that
these
men
had
justice
after
they
had
secured
their
freedom
they
entered
suit
for
my
wife
mother
their
sister
and
her
seven
children
but
as
soon
as
the
brothers
entered
this
suit
robert
logan
who
claimed
my
wife
mother
and
her
children
as
his
slaves
put
them
into
a
trader
yard
in
lexington
and
when
he
saw
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
their
being
successful
in
securing
their
freedom
he
put
them
in
jail
to
be
sold
down
the
river
this
was
a
deliberate
attempt
to
keep
them
from
their
rights
for
he
knew
that
they
were
to
have
been
set
free
many
years
before
and
this
fact
was
known
to
all
the
neighborhood
my
mother
was
born
free
her
mother
having
passed
the
allotted
time
under
a
law
had
been
free
for
many
years
yet
they
kept
her
children
as
slaves
in
plain
violation
of
law
as
well
as
justice
the
children
of
free
persons
under
southern
laws
were
free
this
was
always
admitted
the
course
of
logan
in
putting
the
family
in
jail
for
safe
keeping
until
they
could
be
sent
to
the
southern
market
was
a
tacit
admission
that
he
had
no
legal
hold
upon
them
woods
and
collins
a
couple
of
nigger
traders
were
collecting
a
drove
of
slaves
for
memphis
about
this
time
and
when
they
were
ready
to
start
all
the
family
were
sent
off
with
the
gang
and
when
they
arrived
in
memphis
they
were
put
in
the
traders
yard
of
nathan
bedford
forrest
this
forrest
afterward
became
a
general
in
the
rebel
army
and
commanded
at
the
capture
of
fort
pillow
and
in
harmony
with
the
debasing
influences
of
his
early
business
he
was
responsible
for
the
fiendish
massacre
of
negroes
after
the
capture
of
the
fort
an
act
which
will
make
his
name
forever
infamous
none
of
this
family
were
sold
to
the
same
person
except
my
wife
and
one
sister
all
the
rest
were
sold
to
different
persons
the
elder
daughter
was
sold
seven
times
in
one
day
the
reason
of
this
was
that
the
parties
that
bought
her
finding
that
she
was
not
legally
a
slave
and
that
they
could
get
no
written
guarantee
that
she
was
got
rid
of
her
as
soon
as
possible
it
seems
that
those
who
bought
the
other
members
of
the
family
were
not
so
particular
and
were
willing
to
run
the
risk
they
knew
that
such
things
such
outrages
upon
law
and
justice
were
common
among
these
was
my
boss
who
bought
two
of
the
girls
matilda
and
her
sister
mary
ellen
matilda
was
bought
for
a
cook
her
sister
was
a
present
to
farrington
his
wife
sister
to
act
as
her
maid
and
seamstress
aunt
delia
who
had
been
cook
was
given
another
branch
of
work
to
do
and
matilda
was
installed
as
cook
i
remember
well
the
day
she
came
the
madam
greeted
her
and
said
well
what
can
you
do
girl
have
you
ever
done
any
cooking
where
are
you
from
matilda
was
as
i
remember
her
a
sad
picture
to
look
at
she
had
been
a
slave
it
is
true
but
had
seen
good
days
to
what
the
slaves
down
the
river
saw
any
one
could
see
she
was
almost
she
never
seemed
happy
days
grew
into
weeks
and
weeks
into
months
but
the
same
routine
of
work
went
on
my
marriage
birth
of
twins
matilda
had
been
there
three
years
when
i
married
her
the
boss
had
always
promised
that
he
would
give
me
a
nice
wedding
and
he
kept
his
word
he
was
very
proud
and
liked
praise
the
wedding
that
he
gave
us
was
indeed
a
pleasant
one
all
the
slaves
from
their
neighbor
acquaintances
were
invited
one
thing
boss
did
was
a
credit
to
him
but
it
was
rare
among
he
had
me
married
by
their
parish
minister
it
was
a
beautiful
evening
the
of
november
when
matilda
and
i
stood
in
the
parlor
of
the
mcgee
house
and
were
solemnly
made
man
and
wife
old
master
jack
came
up
from
panola
at
that
time
and
was
there
when
the
ceremony
was
performed
as
he
looked
through
his
fingers
at
us
he
was
overheard
saying
it
will
ruin
them
givin
things
went
on
as
usual
after
this
the
madam
grew
more
irritable
and
exacting
always
finding
fault
with
the
servants
whipping
them
or
threatening
to
do
so
upon
the
slightest
provocation
or
none
at
all
there
was
something
in
my
wife
manner
however
which
kept
the
madam
from
whipping
her
an
open
or
implied
threat
perhaps
that
such
treatment
would
not
be
endured
without
resistance
or
protest
of
some
kind
this
the
madam
regarded
as
a
great
indignity
and
she
hated
my
wife
for
it
and
at
times
was
ready
to
crush
her
so
great
was
her
anger
in
a
year
there
were
born
to
us
twin
babies
and
the
madam
now
thought
she
had
my
wife
tied
as
the
babies
would
be
a
barrier
to
anything
like
resistance
on
her
part
and
there
would
be
no
danger
of
her
running
away
she
therefore
thought
that
she
could
enjoy
without
hindrance
the
privilege
of
beating
the
woman
of
whose
womanhood
she
had
theretofore
stood
somewhat
in
fear
madam
cruelty
to
my
wife
and
children
boss
said
from
the
first
that
i
should
give
my
wife
assistance
as
she
needed
time
to
care
for
the
babies
really
he
was
not
as
bad
as
the
madam
at
heart
for
she
tried
to
see
how
hard
she
could
be
on
us
she
gave
me
all
the
extra
work
to
do
that
she
could
think
of
apparently
to
keep
me
from
helping
my
wife
in
the
kitchen
she
had
all
the
cooking
to
do
for
three
heavy
meals
each
day
all
the
washing
and
ironing
of
the
finest
clothes
besides
caring
for
the
babies
between
times
in
the
morning
she
would
nurse
the
babies
then
hurry
off
to
the
kitchen
to
get
breakfast
while
they
were
left
in
charge
of
a
little
girl
again
at
noon
she
repeated
her
visit
to
the
babies
after
cooking
the
dinner
then
in
the
evening
after
supper
she
would
go
to
nurse
them
again
after
supper
was
over
dishes
all
washed
and
kitchen
in
order
she
would
then
go
to
the
little
ones
for
the
night
one
can
see
that
she
had
very
little
time
with
the
children
my
heart
was
sore
and
heavy
for
my
wife
was
almost
run
to
death
with
work
the
children
grew
puny
and
sickly
for
want
of
proper
care
the
doctor
said
it
was
because
the
milk
the
mother
nursed
to
them
was
so
heated
by
her
constant
and
excessive
labors
as
to
be
unwholesome
and
she
never
had
time
to
cool
before
ministering
to
them
so
the
little
things
instead
of
thriving
and
developing
as
was
their
right
dwindled
toward
the
inevitable
end
oh
we
were
wretched
our
hearts
ached
for
a
day
which
we
could
call
our
own
my
wife
was
a
christian
and
had
learned
to
know
the
worth
of
prayer
so
would
always
speak
consolingly
god
will
help
us
she
said
let
us
try
and
be
patient
our
trial
went
on
until
one
morning
i
heard
a
great
fuss
in
the
house
the
madam
calling
for
the
yard
man
to
come
and
tie
my
wife
as
she
could
not
manage
her
my
wife
had
always
refused
to
allow
the
madam
to
whip
her
but
now
as
the
babies
were
here
mistress
thought
she
would
try
it
once
more
matilda
resisted
and
madam
called
for
boss
in
a
minute
he
came
and
grabbing
my
wife
commenced
choking
her
saying
to
her
what
do
you
mean
is
that
the
way
you
talk
to
ladies
my
wife
had
only
said
to
her
mistress
you
shall
not
whip
me
this
made
her
furious
hence
her
call
for
boss
i
was
in
the
dining
room
and
could
hear
everything
my
blood
boiled
in
my
veins
to
see
my
wife
so
abused
yet
i
dare
not
open
my
mouth
after
the
fuss
my
wife
went
straight
to
the
laundry
i
followed
her
there
and
found
her
bundling
up
her
babies
clothes
which
were
washed
but
not
ironed
i
knew
at
a
glance
that
she
was
going
away
boss
had
just
gone
to
the
city
and
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
but
i
told
her
to
do
the
best
she
could
often
when
company
came
and
i
held
the
horses
or
did
an
errand
for
them
they
would
tip
me
to
a
quarter
or
half
a
dollar
this
money
i
always
saved
and
so
had
a
little
change
which
i
now
gave
to
matilda
for
her
use
in
her
effort
to
get
away
from
her
cruel
treatment
she
started
at
once
for
forrest
trader
yards
with
the
babies
in
her
arms
and
after
she
got
into
memphis
she
stopped
outside
the
yard
to
rest
while
she
was
sitting
on
the
curb
stone
forrest
came
out
of
the
yard
by
the
back
gate
and
saw
her
coming
up
to
her
he
said
my
god
matilda
what
are
you
doing
here
you
have
changed
so
i
would
not
have
known
you
why
have
you
come
here
matilda
said
i
came
back
here
to
be
sold
again
he
stepped
back
and
called
another
nigger
trader
collins
by
name
from
kentucky
look
here
said
forrest
pointing
to
my
wife
collins
took
in
the
situation
at
once
and
said
he
would
buy
her
and
the
children
that
woman
is
of
a
good
family
said
he
and
was
only
sold
to
prevent
her
from
getting
her
freedom
she
was
then
taken
into
the
yard
oh
said
forrest
i
know
these
mcgees
they
are
hard
colts
word
was
then
sent
mcgee
that
his
cook
was
in
the
yard
and
had
come
to
be
sold
he
went
in
haste
to
the
yard
collins
offered
to
buy
her
but
mcgee
said
no
man
money
could
buy
that
woman
and
her
children
i
raised
her
husband
and
i
would
not
separate
them
she
was
brought
back
and
as
they
rode
along
in
the
rockaway
boss
said
when
i
am
through
with
you
i
guess
you
wo
run
away
again
as
they
drove
up
i
saw
the
madam
go
running
out
to
meet
them
she
shouted
to
matilda
ah
madam
you
put
up
at
the
wrong
hotel
they
at
once
went
to
the
barn
where
my
wife
was
tied
to
the
joist
and
boss
and
the
madam
beat
her
by
turns
after
they
had
finished
the
whipping
boss
said
tauntingly
now
i
am
buying
you
and
selling
you
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
never
shall
sell
you
while
my
head
and
yours
is
hot
i
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
for
i
was
powerless
to
do
anything
for
her
my
twin
babies
lived
only
six
months
after
that
not
having
had
the
care
they
needed
and
which
it
was
impossible
for
their
mother
to
give
them
while
performing
the
almost
endless
labor
required
of
her
under
threats
of
cruel
beatings
one
day
not
long
after
our
babies
were
buried
the
madam
followed
my
wife
to
the
smoke
house
and
said
i
am
tempted
to
take
that
knife
from
you
matilda
and
cut
you
in
two
you
and
old
ruben
one
of
the
slaves
went
all
around
the
neighborhood
and
told
the
people
that
i
killed
your
babies
and
almost
whipped
you
to
death
of
course
when
the
slaves
were
accused
falsely
as
in
this
case
they
were
not
allowed
to
make
any
reply
they
just
had
to
endure
in
silence
whatever
was
said
efforts
to
learn
to
read
and
write
thomas
the
coachman
and
i
were
fast
friends
we
used
to
get
together
every
time
we
had
a
chance
and
talk
about
freedom
oh
tom
would
say
if
i
could
only
write
i
remember
when
tom
first
began
to
take
lessons
at
night
from
some
plasterers
workmen
of
the
neighborhood
they
saw
that
he
was
so
anxious
to
learn
that
they
promised
to
teach
him
every
evening
if
he
would
slip
out
to
their
house
i
too
was
eager
to
learn
to
read
and
write
but
did
not
have
the
opportunity
which
tom
had
of
getting
out
at
night
i
had
to
sleep
in
the
house
where
the
folks
were
and
could
not
go
out
without
being
observed
while
tom
had
quarters
in
another
part
of
the
establishment
and
could
slip
out
unobserved
tom
however
consoled
me
by
saying
that
he
would
teach
me
as
soon
as
he
knew
how
so
tom
one
night
put
a
copy
of
some
figures
on
the
side
of
the
barn
for
me
to
practice
from
i
took
the
chalk
and
imitated
him
as
near
as
i
could
but
my
work
was
poor
beside
his
as
he
had
been
learning
for
some
months
and
could
make
the
figures
quite
well
and
write
a
little
still
i
kept
trying
tom
encouraging
me
and
telling
me
that
i
would
learn
in
time
just
keep
trying
said
he
when
this
first
lesson
was
over
i
forgot
to
rub
out
the
marks
on
the
barn
and
the
next
morning
when
old
master
jack
who
happened
to
be
at
our
home
just
at
that
time
went
out
there
and
saw
the
copy
and
my
imitation
of
it
he
at
once
raised
great
excitement
by
calling
attention
to
the
rude
characters
and
wanting
to
know
who
had
done
that
i
was
afraid
to
own
that
i
had
done
it
but
old
master
jack
somehow
surmised
that
it
was
tom
or
i
for
he
said
to
boss
edmund
you
must
watch
those
fellows
louis
and
thomas
if
you
do
they
will
get
spoilt
spoilt
they
are
pretty
close
to
town
here
here
tom
and
i
laughed
over
this
a
good
deal
and
how
easily
we
slipped
out
of
it
but
concluded
not
to
stop
trying
to
learn
all
we
could
tom
always
said
lou
i
am
going
to
be
a
free
man
yet
then
we
will
need
some
education
no
let
us
never
stop
trying
to
learn
tom
was
a
virginian
as
i
was
and
was
sold
from
his
parents
when
a
mere
lad
boss
used
to
write
to
his
parents
owners
occasionally
that
his
people
might
hear
from
him
the
letters
were
to
his
mother
but
sent
in
care
of
the
white
folks
tom
had
progressed
very
fast
in
his
secret
studies
and
could
write
enough
to
frame
a
letter
it
seems
it
had
been
over
a
year
since
boss
had
written
for
him
but
nothing
was
said
until
one
morning
i
heard
boss
telling
tom
to
come
to
the
barn
to
be
whipped
he
showed
tom
three
letters
which
he
had
written
to
his
mother
and
this
so
startled
him
that
he
said
nothing
i
listened
breathlessly
to
each
word
boss
said
where
did
you
learn
to
write
asked
he
and
when
did
you
learn
how
long
have
you
been
writing
to
your
mother
at
that
moment
he
produced
the
three
letters
which
tom
had
written
boss
it
seems
had
mistrusted
something
and
spoke
to
the
postmaster
telling
him
to
stop
any
letters
which
tom
might
mail
for
virginia
to
his
mother
the
postmaster
did
as
directed
for
slaves
had
no
rights
which
postmasters
were
bound
to
respect
hence
the
letters
fell
into
the
master
hands
instead
of
going
to
their
destination
tom
not
hearing
from
his
first
letter
wrote
a
second
then
a
third
never
dreaming
that
they
had
been
intercepted
boss
raged
and
tom
was
severely
whipped
after
this
nothing
tom
did
pleased
any
of
the
family
it
was
a
continual
pick
on
him
everything
was
wrong
with
both
of
us
for
they
were
equally
hard
on
me
they
mistrusted
i
think
that
i
could
write
yet
i
could
not
find
out
just
what
they
did
think
tom
strikes
for
liberty
and
gains
it
tom
stayed
only
a
few
weeks
after
this
he
said
to
me
one
morning
lou
i
am
going
away
if
i
can
get
a
boat
that
is
starting
off
why
i
am
gone
from
this
place
i
was
sad
to
see
him
go
for
he
was
like
a
brother
to
me
he
was
my
companion
and
friend
he
went
and
was
just
in
time
to
catch
the
boat
at
the
memphis
dock
he
succeeded
in
getting
on
and
made
an
application
to
the
captain
to
work
on
the
boat
the
captain
did
not
hesitate
to
employ
him
as
it
was
common
for
slaves
to
be
permitted
to
hire
themselves
out
for
wages
which
they
were
required
to
return
in
whole
or
in
part
to
their
masters
of
course
all
such
slaves
carried
a
written
pass
to
this
effect
tom
was
shrewd
and
having
learned
to
write
fairly
well
he
wrote
himself
a
pass
which
was
of
the
usual
kind
stating
his
name
to
whom
he
belonged
and
that
he
was
privileged
to
hire
himself
out
wherever
he
could
coming
and
going
as
he
pleased
where
the
slave
was
an
exceptional
one
and
where
the
owner
had
only
two
or
three
slaves
a
pass
would
readily
be
given
to
hire
himself
out
or
hire
his
own
time
as
it
was
generally
called
he
being
required
to
turn
over
to
his
master
a
certain
amount
of
his
earnings
each
month
or
week
and
to
make
a
report
to
his
master
of
his
whereabouts
and
receipts
sometimes
the
slave
would
be
required
to
turn
in
to
his
master
a
certain
sum
as
for
instance
fifty
or
one
hundred
dollars
a
year
and
he
would
have
to
earn
that
before
he
could
use
any
of
his
earnings
for
himself
if
he
was
a
mechanic
he
would
have
little
trouble
in
doing
this
as
the
wages
of
such
were
often
quite
liberal
this
kind
of
a
pass
was
rarely
if
ever
given
by
the
planters
having
large
numbers
of
slaves
another
kind
of
pass
read
something
like
this
pass
my
boy
or
my
girl
as
the
case
might
be
the
name
being
attached
these
were
only
given
to
permit
the
slave
to
go
from
the
farm
of
his
own
master
to
that
of
another
some
men
had
wives
or
children
belonging
on
neighboring
farms
and
would
be
given
passes
to
visit
them
without
such
a
pass
they
were
liable
to
be
stopped
and
turned
back
to
their
homes
there
was
however
a
good
deal
of
visiting
without
passes
but
it
was
against
the
general
rule
which
required
them
and
any
slave
leaving
home
without
a
pass
was
liable
to
punishment
if
discovered
on
our
plantation
passes
were
never
given
but
the
slaves
did
visit
in
the
neighborhood
notwithstanding
and
would
sometimes
slip
into
town
at
night
tom
had
in
this
way
seen
the
pass
of
a
neighboring
slave
to
hire
out
and
it
was
from
this
he
learned
the
form
from
which
he
wrote
his
and
which
opened
his
way
to
freedom
upon
reading
tom
pass
the
captain
did
not
hesitate
but
hired
him
at
once
and
tom
worked
his
way
to
new
orleans
to
which
city
the
boat
was
bound
in
the
meantime
boss
took
me
and
we
drove
to
numerous
stations
where
he
telegraphed
ahead
for
his
boy
tom
but
tom
reached
new
orleans
without
hindrance
and
there
fell
in
with
the
steward
of
a
boston
steamer
and
getting
aboard
of
it
was
soon
on
the
ocean
on
his
way
to
that
city
where
were
so
many
friends
of
the
slave
arriving
there
he
made
his
way
to
canada
which
was
for
so
many
generations
the
only
land
of
freedom
attainable
to
american
slaves
news
of
tom
reaching
canada
now
that
tom
was
gone
excitement
prevailed
at
the
house
among
the
white
folks
nothing
had
been
heard
of
him
or
the
method
of
his
escape
all
the
servants
expected
that
he
would
be
caught
and
i
was
alarmed
every
time
boss
came
from
the
city
fearing
that
he
had
news
that
tom
was
caught
he
had
been
gone
about
six
months
when
one
morning
i
went
to
the
postoffice
and
brought
back
a
letter
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
felt
that
it
contained
something
unusual
but
i
did
not
know
what
it
was
it
proved
to
be
a
letter
from
tom
to
boss
they
did
not
intend
that
the
servants
should
know
it
was
from
tom
but
one
of
the
house
maids
heard
them
reading
it
and
came
out
and
told
us
she
whispered
tom
is
free
he
has
gone
to
canada
boss
read
it
in
the
letter
lou
brought
this
news
cheered
me
and
made
me
eager
to
get
away
but
i
never
heard
from
him
any
more
until
after
the
rebellion
tom
gone
made
my
duties
more
i
now
had
to
drive
the
carriage
but
uncle
madison
was
kept
at
the
barn
to
do
the
work
there
and
hitch
up
the
team
i
only
had
to
drive
when
the
family
went
out
expects
to
capture
tom
in
the
summer
the
mcgees
made
up
their
minds
to
go
down
east
and
come
around
by
niagara
falls
for
this
was
the
place
from
which
tom
had
written
them
boss
had
great
confidence
in
himself
and
did
not
doubt
his
ability
to
take
tom
home
with
him
if
he
should
meet
him
even
though
it
should
be
in
canada
so
he
took
a
pair
of
handcuffs
with
him
as
a
preparation
for
the
enterprise
his
young
nephew
had
been
to
niagara
falls
and
seen
and
talked
with
tom
but
boss
said
if
he
had
seen
him
anywhere
he
would
have
laid
hands
on
him
at
once
and
taken
him
home
at
all
hazards
making
clothes
when
the
family
went
on
this
visit
down
east
i
was
left
in
charge
of
the
house
and
was
expected
to
keep
everything
in
order
and
also
to
make
the
winter
clothes
for
the
farm
hands
the
madam
and
i
had
cut
out
these
clothes
before
she
left
and
it
was
my
principal
duty
to
run
the
sewing
machine
in
their
manufacture
many
whole
days
i
spent
in
this
work
my
wife
made
the
button
holes
and
sewed
on
the
buttons
i
made
hundreds
of
sacks
for
use
in
picking
cotton
this
work
was
always
done
in
summer
when
the
garments
were
all
finished
they
were
shipped
to
the
farm
at
bolivar
to
be
ready
for
the
fall
and
winter
wear
in
like
manner
the
clothes
for
summer
use
were
made
in
winter
a
superstition
it
was
the
custom
in
those
days
for
slaves
to
carry
bags
it
was
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
and
though
it
was
one
of
the
superstitions
of
a
barbarous
ancestry
it
was
still
very
generally
and
tenaciously
held
to
by
all
classes
i
carried
a
little
bag
which
i
got
from
an
old
slave
who
claimed
that
it
had
power
to
prevent
any
one
who
carried
it
from
being
whipped
it
was
made
of
leather
and
contained
roots
nuts
pins
and
some
other
things
the
claim
that
it
would
prevent
the
folks
from
whipping
me
so
much
i
found
was
not
sustained
by
my
experience
my
whippings
came
just
the
same
many
of
the
servants
were
thorough
believers
in
it
though
and
carried
these
bags
all
the
time
memphis
and
its
commercial
importance
the
city
of
memphis
from
its
high
bluff
on
the
mississippi
overlooks
the
surrounding
country
for
a
long
distance
the
muddy
waters
of
the
river
when
at
a
low
stage
lap
the
ever
crumbling
banks
that
yearly
change
yielding
to
new
deflections
of
the
current
for
hundreds
of
miles
below
there
is
a
highly
interesting
and
rarely
broken
series
of
forests
cane
brakes
and
sand
bars
covered
with
masses
of
willows
and
poplars
which
in
the
spring
when
the
floods
come
down
are
overflowed
for
many
miles
back
it
was
found
necessary
to
run
embankments
practically
parallel
with
the
current
in
order
to
confine
the
waters
of
the
river
in
its
channel
memphis
was
and
is
the
most
important
city
of
tennessee
indeed
the
most
important
between
louis
and
new
orleans
particularly
from
the
commercial
point
of
view
cotton
was
the
principal
product
of
the
territory
tributary
to
it
the
street
running
along
the
bluff
was
called
front
row
and
was
filled
with
stores
and
business
houses
this
street
was
the
principal
cotton
market
and
here
the
article
which
in
those
days
was
personified
as
the
commercial
king
was
bought
and
sold
and
whence
it
was
shipped
or
stored
awaiting
an
advancing
price
the
completion
of
the
memphis
and
charleston
railroad
was
a
great
event
in
the
history
of
the
city
it
was
termed
the
marriage
of
the
mississippi
and
the
atlantic
and
was
celebrated
with
a
great
popular
demonstration
people
coming
from
the
surrounding
country
for
many
miles
water
was
brought
from
the
atlantic
ocean
and
poured
into
the
river
and
water
taken
from
the
river
and
poured
into
the
atlantic
at
charleston
it
was
anticipated
that
this
railroad
connection
between
the
two
cities
would
make
of
charleston
the
great
shipping
port
and
of
memphis
the
principal
cotton
market
of
the
southwest
the
expectation
in
neither
of
these
cases
has
been
fully
realized
boss
in
common
with
planters
and
business
men
throughout
that
whole
region
was
greatly
excited
i
attended
him
and
thus
had
the
opportunity
of
witnessing
this
notable
celebration
illustration
chapter
iii
slavery
and
the
war
of
the
rebellion
beginning
of
the
war
i
remember
well
when
abraham
lincoln
was
elected
boss
and
the
madam
had
been
reading
the
papers
when
he
broke
out
with
the
exclamation
the
very
idea
of
electing
an
old
rail
splitter
to
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
well
he
never
take
his
seat
when
lincoln
was
inaugurated
boss
old
master
jack
and
a
great
company
of
men
met
at
our
house
to
discuss
the
matter
and
they
were
wild
with
excitement
was
not
this
excitement
an
admission
that
their
confidence
in
their
ability
to
whip
the
yankees
five
or
six
to
one
was
not
so
strong
as
they
pretended
the
war
had
been
talked
of
for
some
time
but
at
last
it
came
when
the
rebels
fired
upon
fort
sumter
then
great
excitement
arose
the
next
day
when
i
drove
boss
to
town
he
went
into
the
store
of
one
williams
a
merchant
and
when
he
came
out
he
stepped
to
the
carriage
and
said
what
do
you
think
old
abraham
lincoln
has
called
for
four
hundred
thousand
men
to
come
to
washington
immediately
well
let
them
come
we
will
make
a
breakfast
of
them
i
can
whip
a
half
dozen
yankees
with
my
pocket
knife
this
was
the
chief
topic
everywhere
soon
after
this
boss
bought
himself
a
six
shooter
i
had
to
mould
the
bullets
for
him
and
every
afternoon
he
would
go
out
to
practice
by
his
direction
i
fixed
a
large
piece
of
white
paper
on
the
back
fence
and
in
the
center
of
it
put
a
large
black
dot
at
this
mark
he
would
fire
away
expecting
to
hit
it
but
he
did
not
succeed
well
he
would
sometimes
miss
the
fence
entirely
the
ball
going
out
into
the
woods
beyond
each
time
he
would
shoot
i
would
have
to
run
down
to
the
fence
to
see
how
near
he
came
to
the
mark
when
he
came
very
near
to
it
within
an
inch
or
so
he
would
say
laughingly
ah
i
would
have
got
him
that
time
meaning
a
yankee
soldier
there
was
something
very
ludicrous
in
this
pistol
practice
of
a
man
who
boasted
that
he
could
whip
half
a
dozen
yankees
with
a
jackknife
every
day
for
a
month
this
business
so
tiresome
to
me
went
on
boss
was
very
brave
until
it
came
time
for
him
to
go
to
war
when
his
courage
oozed
out
and
he
sent
a
substitute
he
remaining
at
home
as
a
home
guard
one
day
when
i
came
back
with
the
papers
from
the
city
the
house
was
soon
ringing
with
cries
of
victory
boss
said
why
that
was
a
great
battle
at
bull
run
if
our
men
had
only
known
at
first
what
they
afterwords
found
out
they
would
have
wiped
all
the
yankees
out
and
succeeded
in
taking
washington
petty
disrespect
to
the
emblem
of
the
union
right
after
the
bombardment
of
fort
sumter
they
brought
to
memphis
the
union
flag
that
floated
over
the
fort
there
was
a
great
jubilee
in
celebration
of
this
portions
of
the
flag
no
larger
than
a
half
dollar
in
paper
money
were
given
out
to
the
and
these
evidences
of
their
treason
were
long
preserved
as
precious
treasures
boss
had
one
of
these
pieces
which
he
kept
a
long
time
but
as
the
rebel
cause
waned
these
reminders
of
its
beginning
were
less
and
less
seen
and
if
any
of
them
are
now
in
existence
it
is
not
likely
that
their
possessors
will
take
any
pride
in
exposing
them
to
view
as
the
war
continued
we
would
now
and
then
hear
of
some
slave
of
our
neighborhood
running
away
to
the
yankees
it
was
common
when
the
message
of
a
union
victory
came
to
see
the
slaves
whispering
to
each
other
we
will
be
free
i
tried
to
catch
everything
i
could
about
the
war
i
was
so
eager
for
the
success
of
the
union
cause
these
things
went
on
until
the
battle
of
shiloh
april
boss
came
hurrying
in
one
morning
right
after
breakfast
calling
to
me
lou
lou
come
we
have
a
great
victory
i
want
to
go
up
and
carry
the
boys
something
to
eat
i
want
you
and
matilda
to
get
something
ready
as
quickly
as
you
can
a
barrel
of
flour
was
rolled
into
the
kitchen
and
my
wife
and
i
pitched
in
to
work
biscuit
bread
ham
tongue
all
kinds
of
meat
and
bread
were
rapidly
cooked
and
though
the
task
was
a
heavy
one
for
my
wife
and
me
we
worked
steadily
and
about
five
in
the
afternoon
the
things
were
ready
one
of
the
large
baskets
used
to
hold
cotton
was
packed
full
of
these
provisions
our
limbs
ached
from
the
strain
of
the
work
for
we
had
little
help
one
reason
for
the
anxiety
of
the
boss
for
the
preparation
of
this
provision
for
the
soldiers
was
that
he
knew
so
many
in
one
of
the
companies
which
was
known
as
the
como
avengers
and
he
had
a
son
a
nephew
and
a
brother
of
his
wife
connected
with
it
the
latter
a
major
on
martin
staff
on
the
following
morning
i
got
up
early
and
hurried
with
my
work
to
get
through
as
i
had
to
go
to
the
postoffice
madam
hurried
me
off
as
she
expected
a
letter
from
her
husband
who
had
promised
to
write
at
the
earliest
moment
of
their
friends
and
relatives
i
rushed
into
the
city
at
full
speed
got
some
letters
and
a
morning
paper
and
returning
as
rapidly
as
possible
gave
them
to
her
she
grasped
them
eagerly
and
commenced
reading
the
paper
in
a
short
time
i
heard
her
calling
me
to
come
to
her
i
went
in
and
she
said
in
great
excitement
louis
we
want
to
have
you
drive
us
into
town
to
see
the
yankee
prisoners
who
are
coming
through
at
noon
from
shiloh
i
went
and
told
madison
to
hitch
up
as
soon
as
he
could
in
the
meantime
i
got
myself
ready
and
it
was
not
long
before
we
were
off
for
the
city
the
madam
was
accompanied
by
a
friend
of

sisters
of

and
fanny
a
colored
woman
edward

a

in

news

great
battle

all

near
relatives
in
it
jack
mcgee
and
charles
dandridge
had
each
a
son
in
the
terrible
conflict
mourning
in
master
family
in
the
afternoon
when
all
were
seated
in
the
library
reading
and
i
was
in
the
dining
room
finishing
up
my
work
i
happened
to
look
out
of
the
window
and
saw
a
messenger
coming
up
the
graveled
walk
i
went
out
to
meet
him
telegram
for
mcgee
he
said
i
took
it
to
her
and
reading
it
without
a
word
she
passed
it
to
the
next
member
of
the
family
and
so
it
was
passed
around
until
all
had
read
it
except
dandridge
when
it
was
handed
to
her
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
it
contained
for
her
the
most
sorrowful
tidings
as
she
read
she
became
livid
and
when
she
had
finished
she
covered
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
giving
a
great
heavy
sob
by
this
time
the
whole
family
was
crying
and
screaming
oh
our
mack
is
killed
mars
mack
is
killed
was
echoed
by
the
servants
in
tones
of
sorrow
for
he
was
an
exceptional
young
man
every
one
loved
him
both
whites
and
blacks
the
affection
of
the
slaves
for
him
bordered
on
reverence
and
this
was
true
not
alone
of
his
father
slaves
but
of
all
those
who
knew
him
this
telegram
was
from
boss
and
announced
that
he
would
be
home
the
next
day
with
the
remains
farrington
at
once
wrote
to
old
master
jack
and
to
dandridge
telling
them
of
mack
death
and
to
come
at
once
after
i
mailed
those
letters
nothing
unusual
happened
during
the
afternoon
and
the
house
was
wrapped
in
silence
and
gloom
on
the
following
morning
i
went
for
the
mail
as
usual
but
there
was
nothing
new
at
noon
the
remains
of
the
much
loved
young
man
arrived
at
our
station
accompanied
by
boss
and
henry
dandridge
brother
of
the
father
of
the
deceased
who
was
a
surgeon
in
the
rebel
army
i
went
to
the
station
with
another
servant
to
assist
in
bringing
the
body
to
the
house
we
carried
it
into
the
back
parlor
and
after
all
had
been
made
ready
we
proceeded
to
wash
and
dress
it
he
had
lain
on
the
battlefield
two
days
before
he
was
found
and
his
face
was
black
as
a
piece
of
coal
but
henry
dandridge
with
his
ready
tact
suggested
the
idea
of
painting
it
i
was
there
to
assist
in
whatever
way
they
needed
me
after
the
body
was
all
dressed
and
the
face
painted
cheeks
tinted
with
a
rosy
hue
to
appear
as
he
always
did
in
life
the
look
was
natural
and
handsome
we
were
all
the
afternoon
employed
in
this
sad
work
and
it
was
not
until
late
in
the
evening
that
his
father
and
mother
came
down
to
view
the
body
for
the
first
time
i
remember
as
they
came
down
the
broad
stairs
together
the
yet
calm
look
of
those
two
people
dandridge
was
very
calm
her
grief
was
too
great
for
her
to
scream
as
the
others
did
when
they
went
in
she
stood
and
looked
at
her
mack
then
turning
to
boss
she
said
cousin
eddie
how
brave
he
was
he
died
for
his
country
poor
sorrowing
misguided
woman
it
was
not
for
his
country
he
died
but
for
the
perpetuation
of
the
cruel
the
infamous
system
of
human
slavery
all
the
servants
were
allowed
to
come
in
and
view
the
body
many
sad
tears
were
shed
by
them
some
of
the
older
slaves
clasped
their
hands
as
if
in
mute
prayer
and
exclaimed
as
they
passed
by
the
coffin
he
was
a
lovin
boy
it
seems
that
all
his
company
but
five
or
six
were
killed
at
an
early
hour
next
morning
the
funeral
party
started
for
the
home
in
panola
where
the
body
of
the
lamented
young
man
sacrificed
to
an
unholy
cause
was
buried
at
the
close
of
the
same
day
edward
stayed
at
our
house
some
six
weeks
his
ankle
was
so
slow
in
getting
well
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
could
walk
with
the
aid
of
crutches
and
he
took
fanny
and
went
home
alarm
of
the
memphis
rebels
not
long
after
this
the
people
were
very
much
worked
up
over
the
military
situation
the
yankees
had
taken
nashville
and
had
begun
to
bombard
fort
pillow
the
officials
of
the
memphis
and
ohio
railroad
company
became
alarmed
at
the
condition
of
things
fearing
for
the
safety
of
their
stock
the
officers
therefore
set
about
devising
some
plan
by
which
they
might
get
the
cars
down
on
the
memphis
and
jackson
road
where
they
imagined
their
property
would
be
safe
from
the
now
terrible
yankees
the
railroad
officials
at
once
set
to
work
to
buy
the
right
of
way
through
main
street
to
give
them
the
connection
with
the
southern
road
named
at
first
it
was
refused
by
the
city
authorities
but
finally
the
right
of
way
was
granted
when
however
the
railroad
men
began
to
lay
the
ties
and
rails
the
people
grew
furious
some
fled
at
once
for
they
imagined
that
this
act
of
the
railroad
officials
indicated
that
the
yankees
must
be
coming
pretty
near
boss
became
so
excited
at
this
time
that
he
almost
felt
like
going
away
too
the
family
grew
more
and
more
uneasy
and
it
was
the
continual
talk
we
must
get
away
from
memphis
the
companies
are
already
moving
their
rolling
stock
fearing
the
yankees
may
come
at
any
time
and
destroy
everything
we
must
get
away
said
boss
speaking
to
the
madam
the
family
flee
from
memphis
things
continued
in
this
way
until
about
june
the
union
troops
had
taken
fort
pillow
we
had
heard
the
firing
of
cannon
and
did
not
know
what
it
meant
one
morning
i
was
in
the
city
after
the
mail
and
i
learned
that
a
transient
boat
had
just
come
down
the
river
which
had
lost
a
part
of
her
wheelhouse
she
was
fired
on
from
fort
pillow
sustaining
this
serious
damage
from
the
shot
this
increased
the
excitement
among
the
people
and
our
folks
became
alarmed
right
away
and
commenced
talking
of
moving
and
running
the
servants
away
from
the
yankees
to
a
place
of
safety
mcgee
was
trying
for
some
time
to
get
some
one
to
take
the
house
that
is
to
live
in
and
care
for
it
until
after
the
war
while
the
family
were
gone
they
never
thought
that
slavery
would
be
abolished
and
so
hoped
to
come
back
again
after
some
search
they
found
a
widow
a
hancock
she
was
to
have
full
charge
of
the
house
and
continue
keeping
boarders
as
she
had
been
doing
in
memphis
the
vaunted
courage
of
this
man
seems
to
have
early
disappeared
and
his
thought
was
chiefly
devoted
to
getting
his
family
and
his
slaves
into
some
obscure
place
as
far
away
as
possible
from
the
yankees
that
were
to
be
so
easily
whipped
we
were
about
two
weeks
getting
ready
to
leave
stowing
away
some
of
the
things
they
did
not
want
to
move
the
boss
and
his
family
my
wife
and
i
and
all
the
house
servants
were
to
go
to
panola
to
his
father
the
family
went
by
rail
but
i
had
to
drive
through
in
a
wagon
i
am
taken
to
bolivar
farm
soon
after
the
family
all
reached
master
jack
boss
took
me
to
his
own
farm
in
bolivar
county
this
separated
me
for
a
time
from
my
wife
for
she
remained
with
the
family
i
had
to
look
after
the
house
at
the
farm
attend
the
dining
room
and
between
meals
sew
every
day
making
clothes
for
the
hands
i
could
run
on
the
machine
eighteen
to
twenty
pairs
of
pants
a
day
but
two
women
made
the
button
holes
and
did
the
basting
for
me
getting
the
goods
all
ready
for
the
machine
capture
of
a
union
trading
boat
the
yankees
had
made
a
raid
through
bolivar
before
i
came
and
the
excitement
had
not
abated
as
they
were
spreading
themselves
all
through
the
state
there
was
a
union
trading
boat
the
lake
city
that
had
been
successful
in
exchanging
her
goods
for
cotton
that
came
from
memphis
she
usually
stopped
at
helena
fryer
point
and
other
small
towns
but
on
a
trip
at
this
time
she
came
about
fifty
miles
farther
down
the
river
to
carson
landing
right
at
boss
farm
she
was
loaded
with
all
kinds
of
merchandise
sugar
tobacco
liquor
etc
she
had
a
crew
of
about
forty
men
but
they
were
not
well
prepared
for
a
vigorous
defense
the
rebel
soldiers
stationed
in
the
vicinity
saw
her
as
she
dropped
her
anchor
near
the
landing
and
they
determined
to
make
an
effort
for
her
capture
they
put
out
pickets
just
above
our
farm
and
allowed
no
one
to
pass
or
stop
to
communicate
with
the
boat
every
one
that
sought
to
pass
was
held
prisoner
and
every
precaution
taken
to
prevent
those
on
the
boat
from
learning
of
the
purposes
of
the
rebels
knowing
that
the
boat
would
land
in
the
morning
if
not
informed
of
the
danger
and
then
it
was
anticipated
that
they
could
easily
make
her
a
prize
there
was
a
small
ferry
boat
behind
the
steamer
and
as
the
latter
dropped
down
stream
and
then
steamed
up
to
the
landing
the
former
stood
off
for
a
few
moments
as
the
steamer
touched
shore
the
rebels
charged
on
her
and
captured
her
without
a
struggle
in
the
meantime
the
ferry
boat
seeing
what
had
happened
sped
away
up
stream
the
soldiers
firing
at
her
but
doing
little
damage
except
the
breaking
of
the
glass
in
the
pilot
house
the
rebels
seeing
that
the
ferry
boat
had
escaped
them
turned
their
attention
to
the
unloading
of
the
steamer
they
sent
out
for
help
in
this
work
and
the
summons
was
answered
by
the
neighbors
far
and
near
wagons
were
brought
two
of
which
were
from
our
farm
and
loaded
with
goods
which
were
taken
to
deer
creek
forty
miles
from
carson
landing
what
goods
they
found
themselves
unable
to
carry
away
were
packed
in
the
warehouse
the
steamer
was
then
burned
mcgee
was
present
and
the
rebel
captain
gave
him
a
written
statement
of
the
affair
to
the
effect
that
the
residents
were
not
responsible
for
it
and
that
this
should
be
a
protection
for
them
against
the
union
forces
the
officers
and
crew
of
the
steamer
to
the
number
of
forty
were
made
prisoners
and
taken
to
deer
creek
the
rebel
headquarters
of
that
region
and
put
in
the
jail
there
the
ferry
boat
that
escaped
went
to
helena
arkansas
and
carried
the
news
of
the
affair
to
the
union
forces
there
boss
taken
prisoner
i
was
told
by
boss
to
take
my
stand
on
our
veranda
and
keep
watch
on
the
river
and
if
i
saw
any
boat
coming
down
to
let
him
know
at
once
i
kept
a
close
watch
the
next
morning
until
about
eight
when
i
saw
a
boat
but
she
had
almost
gone
past
our
house
before
i
discovered
her
i
ran
into
the
house
and
told
boss
he
ordered
me
to
get
his
horse
at
once
which
i
did
and
he
mounted
and
went
down
to
the
landing
as
fast
as
he
could
upon
reaching
there
he
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
union
soldiers
who
had
just
landed
from
the
boat
all
who
came
near
were
captured
the
union
soldiers
went
to
work
and
transferred
all
the
goods
which
the
rebels
had
put
into
the
warehouse
from
the
boat
which
they
had
captured
then
setting
fire
to
the
warehouse
and
the
postoffice
they
pushed
off
yelling
and
shouting
with
glee
among
those
captured
by
the
union
soldiers
were
three
other
rich
planters
besides
boss
all
of
whom
were
taken
to
helena
after
they
had
been
there
about
a
week
the
planters
offered
to
secure
the
release
of
the
unionists
captured
on
the
boat
which
the
rebels
had
burned
at
carson
landing
and
who
had
been
sent
to
the
rebel
jail
at
deer
creek
if
they
were
guaranteed
their
own
release
in
exchange
they
offered
to
bear
the
expense
of
a
messenger
to
the
rebel
officer
at
deer
creek
with
this
proposition
the
union
officer
at
helena
accepted
the
proposition
and
the
messenger
was
sent
off
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
stop
over
at
our
house
both
on
his
way
down
and
back
upon
his
return
he
stopped
over
night
and
the
next
morning
proceeded
on
his
way
when
he
had
gone
about
five
miles
he
saw
a
at
a
landing
on
which
were
people
drinking
and
having
a
merry
time
he
stopped
and
went
aboard
and
in
joining
the
carousal
he
soon
became
so
intoxicated
that
he
was
unable
to
go
on
with
his
journey
among
those
present
was
one
gilcrease
a
cousin
of
the
mcgees
who
recognized
the
man
as
the
messenger
in
this
important
business
went
to
him
and
asked
him
for
the
letters
he
carried
the
fellow
refusing
to
give
them
up
gilcrease
took
them
from
him
and
at
once
sent
to
our
overseer
for
a
reliable
man
by
whom
to
forward
them
to
the
commandant
at
helena
the
overseer
called
me
up
from
the
cabin
to
his
room
and
told
me
that
i
was
to
go
to
helena
to
carry
some
important
papers
and
to
come
to
him
for
them
in
the
morning
and
make
an
early
start
i
left
him
and
went
back
to
my
cabin
my
third
effort
for
freedom
i
made
up
my
mind
that
this
would
be
a
good
chance
for
me
to
run
away
i
got
my
clothes
and
put
them
in
an
old
pair
of
saddle
bags
two
bags
made
of
leather
connected
with
a
strip
of
leather
and
used
when
traveling
horseback
for
the
same
purpose
as
a
satchel
is
used
in
traveling
in
the
cars
i
took
these
bags
carried
them
about
a
half
mile
up
the
road
and
hid
them
in
a
fence
corner
where
i
could
get
them
in
the
morning
when
i
had
started
on
my
trip
fryer
point
the
place
to
which
i
was
to
go
was
about
fifty
miles
from
the
farm
i
started
early
in
the
morning
and
after
i
had
gone
miles
i
came
to
the
farm
of
william
mcgee
a
brother
of
the
madam
and
stopped
to
change
horses
i
found
that
william
mcgee
was
going
in
the
morning
down
to
old
master
jack
so
i
took
one
of
their
horses
leaving
mine
to
use
in
its
place
went
right
to
fryer
point
delivered
the
letters
to
a
man
there
to
carry
to
helena
and
got
back
to
william
mcgee
farm
that
night
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
with
william
down
to
panola
where
madam
was
to
tell
her
about
boss
being
captured
the
next
morning
he
started
and
gibson
his
overseer
and
myself
accompanied
him
he
questioned
me
about
the
capture
of
boss
what
the
soldiers
had
done
and
i
told
him
all
i
knew
of
the
matter
well
lou
he
said
why
did
you
not
bring
us
some
whisky
i
did
bring
a
little
with
me
i
said
he
laughed
saying
oh
well
when
we
come
to
some
clear
water
we
will
stop
and
have
a
drink
then
i
said
smith
will
look
for
me
but
he
wont
see
me
i
am
going
to
tell
the
madam
that
boss
is
captured
hey
ho
he
said
then
you
are
running
away
i
replied
well
i
know
miss
sarah
do
know
boss
is
in
prison
we
traveled
on
all
three
of
us
stopping
at
intervals
to
be
refreshed
after
two
days
we
arrived
at
panola
our
journey
was
a
tedious
one
the
streams
were
so
swollen
in
places
that
we
could
hardly
pass
the
tallehatchie
we
had
to
swim
and
one
of
the
men
came
near
losing
his
horse
and
his
life
the
horses
became
tangled
in
a
prep
vine
as
we
were
nearing
the
shore
at
which
we
aimed
and
the
current
being
very
swift
we
were
carried
below
the
landing
place
but
finally
we
got
safely
ashore
mcgee
landing
and
we
following
reaching
panola
wet
and
weary
i
conveyed
to
madam
the
story
of
her
husband
capture
and
imprisonment
a
rumor
of
which
had
already
reached
her
the
next
morning
was
christmas
and
a
number
of
the
family
had
come
to
spend
it
together
they
had
heard
that
mcgee
was
captured
and
in
prison
but
now
as
i
told
them
every
feature
of
the
affair
in
detail
they
grew
excited
and
talked
wildly
about
it
among
those
who
came
were
dandridge
and
his
wife
blanton
mcgee
and
his
wife
tim
oliver
and
his
wife
all
these
women
were
daughters
of
old
master
jack
mcgee
and
sisters
to
the
madam
farrington
and
old
lady
mcgee
were
already
there
these
on
christmas
were
a
long
established
custom
with
them
but
the
pleasure
of
this
one
was
sadly
marred
by
the
vicissitudes
and
calamities
of
the
war
a
shadow
hung
over
all
the
family
group
they
asked
me
many
questions
about
boss
and
of
course
i
related
all
i
knew
after
i
had
been
there
three
days
they
started
me
back
with
letters
for
boss
when
i
left
it
was
near
night
and
i
was
to
stop
over
at
master
jack
farm
fifteen
miles
away
it
was
expected
that
i
would
reach
fryer
point
on
the
third
morning
thus
allowing
me
three
days
to
go
sixty
miles
but
i
could
not
make
much
headway
as
the
roads
were
so
heavy
the
understanding
was
that
i
was
to
deliver
the
letters
to
the
same
gentleman
at
fryer
to
whom
i
delivered
the
others
for
forwarding
to
boss
at
helena
i
was
then
to
go
straight
to
the
farm
at
boliver
and
report
to
smith
the
overseer
but
after
i
had
got
about
four
miles
away
i
concluded
that
i
would
not
go
back
to
the
farm
but
try
to
get
to
the
yankees
i
knew
i
had
disobeyed
smith
by
going
down
to
the
madam
to
tell
her
about
boss
because
he
told
me
not
to
go
when
i
spoke
to
him
about
it
and
now
if
i
went
back
i
feared
he
would
kill
me
for
i
knew
there
would
be
no
escape
for
me
from
being
run
into
the
bull
ring
and
that
torture
i
could
not
think
of
enduring
i
therefore
stopped
and
taking
the
bridle
and
saddle
from
the
horse
hid
them
in
the
corner
of
a
fence
in
a
cornfield
then
i
went
into
the
woods
the
papers
which
i
had
were
in
the
saddlebag
safe
the
place
where
i
stayed
in
the
daytime
was
in
a
large
a
pen
built
in
the
field
to
feed
stock
from
in
the
winter
time
this
pen
was
on
farm
and
the
second
night
i
worked
my
way
up
near
the
house
knowing
all
the
servants
i
was
watching
a
chance
to
send
word
to
the
coachman
alfred
dandridge
that
i
wanted
him
to
tell
my
wife
that
i
was
not
gone
i
went
down
to
his
cabin
in
the
quarters
and
after
a
short
time
he
came
i
was
badly
scared
and
my
heart
was
heavy
and
sore
but
he
spoke
comfortingly
to
me
and
i
was
cheered
somewhat
especially
when
he
promised
to
see
matilda
and
tell
her
of
my
whereabouts
he
gave
me
some
food
and
hid
me
away
for
the
night
in
his
house
i
kept
close
all
the
next
day
and
at
night
when
all
was
still
alfred
and
i
crept
out
and
went
to
old
master
jack
the
distance
was
not
great
and
we
soon
covered
it
alfred
went
in
and
told
my
wife
that
i
was
outside
and
wanted
to
see
her
she
came
out
and
was
so
frightened
and
nervous
that
she
commenced
sobbing
and
crying
and
almost
fainted
when
i
told
her
in
low
tones
that
i
was
going
to
try
to
get
to
memphis
and
that
alfred
was
helping
to
plan
a
way
to
this
end
the
rebels
occupied
both
roads
leading
to
memphis
and
i
was
puzzled
to
know
how
to
reach
the
city
without
coming
in
contact
with
them
two
days
after
i
had
talked
with
my
wife
the
rebel
troops
who
were
camped
on
the
holly
springs
road
left
for
some
other
point
my
friend
alfred
found
this
out
and
came
and
told
me
the
encouraging
news
the
following
night
i
went
to
old
master
and
told
my
wife
that
the
way
now
seemed
clear
and
that
i
was
going
at
once
i
was
bent
on
freedom
and
would
try
for
it
again
i
urged
my
wife
not
to
grieve
and
endeavored
to
encourage
her
by
saying
that
i
would
return
for
her
as
soon
as
possible
should
i
succeed
in
getting
to
a
land
of
freedom
after
many
tears
and
blessings
we
parted
and
i
left
uncle
alfred
going
with
me
some
three
miles
as
i
was
not
acquainted
with
the
road
when
he
left
me
i
went
on
alone
with
gloomy
forebodings
but
resolved
to
do
my
best
in
this
hazardous
undertaking
whatever
might
happen
the
road
passed
over
hills
and
through
swamps
and
i
found
the
traveling
very
wearisome
i
had
traveled
some
hours
and
thought
i
was
doing
well
when
about
one
in
the
night
i
came
up
out
of
a
long
swamp
and
reaching
the
top
of
a
hill
i
stopped
for
a
rest
raising
myself
to
an
erect
position
from
that
of
walking
inclined
by
reason
of
weariness
and
the
weight
of
the
thrown
across
my
shoulders
the
weather
was
bad
a
heavy
mist
had
come
up
and
was
so
dark
that
i
could
hardly
see
my
way
as
i
started
on
a
soldier
yelled
at
me
from
the
mist
halt
advance
and
give
the
countersign
i
stopped
immediately
almost
scared
out
of
my
wits
come
right
up
here
said
the
soldier
or
i
blow
you
into
eternity
i
saw
at
once
he
was
a
rebel
soldier
i
knew
not
what
to
do
this
place
where
i
was
halted
was
nelson
farm
and
the
house
was
held
as
headquarters
for
a
company
of
rebel
soldiers
known
as
bushwhackers
while
they
belonged
to
the
rebel
army
they
were
in
a
measure
independent
of
its
regulations
and
discipline
kept
back
in
the
woods
ready
for
any
depredation
upon
the
property
of
unionists
any
outrage
upon
their
persons
the
soldier
who
had
halted
me
took
me
up
to
the
house
and
all
began
to
question
me
i
told
them
that
i
had
been
sent
on
an
errand
and
that
i
had
lost
my
way
the
next
morning
i
was
taken
about
a
mile
away
down
in
the
swamp
over
hills
and
through
winding
paths
till
at
last
we
came
to
the
regular
rebel
camp
i
was
in
great
fear
and
thought
my
end
had
come
here
they
began
to
question
me
again
the
captain
taking
the
lead
but
i
still
stuck
to
my
story
that
i
had
been
sent
on
an
errand
and
had
lost
my
way
i
knew
that
this
was
my
only
chance
they
tried
to
make
me
say
that
i
had
come
from
the
yankees
as
they
were
in
camp
near
holly
springs
they
thought
the
yankees
had
sent
me
out
as
a
spy
but
i
said
the
same
as
at
first
that
i
had
lost
my
way
a
soldier
standing
by
said
oh
we
will
make
you
talk
better
than
that
and
stepping
back
to
his
horse
he
took
a
halter
and
said
i
hang
you
there
was
a
law
or
regulation
of
the
rebel
government
directing
or
authorizing
the
hanging
of
any
slave
caught
running
away
and
this
fellow
was
going
to
carry
it
out
to
the
letter
i
talked
and
pleaded
for
my
life
my
feelings
were
indescribable
god
only
knows
what
they
were
carter
one
of
the
soldiers
who
knew
me
and
the
entire
mcgee
family
spoke
up
and
said
you
had
better
let
me
go
and
tell
jack
mcgee
about
him
the
captain
agreed
to
this
and
the
doctor
went
the
following
day
old
jack
came
and
steadily
refused
to
consent
to
my
being
hung
he
said
i
know
edmund
would
not
have
him
he
is
too
no
no
we
will
put
him
in
jail
and
feed
him
on
bread
and
water
too
valuable
a
nigger
to
be
they
tried
again
to
make
me
say
that
i
was
with
the
yankees
they
whipped
me
a
while
then
questioned
me
again
the
switches
that
they
used
stung
me
terribly
they
were
commonly
used
in
mississippi
for
flogging
slaves
one
of
the
refinements
of
the
cruelty
of
the
institution
of
slavery
i
refused
to
say
anything
different
from
what
i
had
said
but
when
they
had
finished
whipping
me
i
was
so
sore
i
could
hardly
move
they
made
up
their
minds
to
put
me
in
jail
at
panola
miles
away
to
be
fed
on
bread
and
water
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
all
arrangements
having
been
made
for
taking
me
to
the
place
appointed
for
those
whose
crime
was
a
too
great
love
for
personal
freedom
they
started
with
me
passing
on
the
way
old
master
jack
where
they
halted
to
let
him
know
that
his
advice
respecting
me
was
to
be
carried
out
the
old
man
called
to
my
wife
come
out
and
see
louis
some
one
had
told
her
that
they
were
going
to
hang
me
and
i
shall
never
forget
her
looks
as
she
came
out
in
the
road
to
bid
me
one
of
the
soldiers
was
softened
by
her
agony
and
whispered
to
her
cry
aunty
we
are
not
going
to
hang
him
we
will
only
put
him
in
jail
i
saw
this
changed
my
wife
looks
in
a
minute
i
said
a
few
words
to
her
and
with
a
prayer
for
god
blessing
on
us
both
we
parted
and
they
moved
on
after
we
had
gone
about
seven
miles
we
met
two
soldiers
who
belonged
to
the
regiment
at
nelson
they
said
hello
where
you
going
with
that
nigger
the
two
men
in
charge
of
me
replied
we
are
going
to
take
him
to
panola
jail
why
said
one
of
the
soldiers
there
is
no
jail
there
the
yanks
passed
through
and
pulled
down
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
jail
and
let
all
the
prisoners
out
this
caused
a
stop
and
a
council
of
war
was
held
in
the
fence
corner
the
result
of
which
was
a
decision
to
take
me
back
to
old
jack
mcgee
after
we
had
gotten
back
there
they
took
me
and
gave
me
another
flogging
to
satisfy
the
madam
i
was
never
so
lacerated
before
i
could
hardly
walk
so
sore
and
weak
was
i
the
law
was
given
me
that
if
ever
i
was
caught
out
in
the
public
road
again
by
any
soldier
i
was
to
be
shot
monday
morning
i
was
sent
to
the
field
to
plow
and
though
i
was
very
stiff
and
my
flesh
seemed
sore
to
the
bone
my
skin
drawn
and
shriveled
as
if
dead
i
had
at
least
to
make
the
attempt
to
work
to
have
said
master
i
am
too
sore
to
work
would
only
have
gotten
me
another
whipping
so
i
obeyed
without
a
word
rebels
burn
their
cotton
the
capture
of
memphis
by
the
union
troops
closed
the
principal
cotton
market
of
the
country
and
there
was
as
a
consequence
an
immense
accumulation
of
the
product
in
the
hands
of
the
farmers
of
that
region
they
were
therefore
compelled
to
resort
to
temporary
expedients
for
its
protection
from
the
elements
old
master
jack
had
his
piled
up
in
a
long
rick
and
shelters
built
over
it
other
farmers
did
the
same
as
cotton
was
almost
the
only
source
of
revenue
for
the
farmers
and
as
there
was
now
no
opportunity
of
getting
it
to
market
there
was
such
a
dearth
of
money
as
had
seldom
if
ever
been
known
and
a
corresponding
dearth
of
those
necessaries
of
life
which
money
was
the
only
means
of
procuring
the
accumulations
of
our
family
in
this
product
were
very
great
while
the
rebel
farmers
were
waiting
for
a
time
when
they
could
turn
their
stores
of
this
valuable
article
into
money
a
proclamation
was
issued
by
the
rebel
government
that
all
the
owners
of
cotton
that
had
it
stored
on
their
farms
must
prepare
to
have
it
burned
hundreds
of
rebel
soldiers
marched
to
every
section
of
mississippi
that
they
could
reach
and
applied
the
torch
to
these
cotton
ricks
the
destruction
was
enormous
this
was
to
prevent
the
cotton
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
unionists
jeff
davis
said
to
his
deluded
followers
that
it
was
better
for
them
to
destroy
this
property
than
to
risk
its
coming
into
the
possession
of
their
enemies
since
that
would
equally
impoverish
themselves
while
it
might
result
to
the
pecuniary
advantage
of
those
with
whom
they
were
at
war
i
know
that
it
was
a
terrible
sight
when
our
cotton
was
burned
hundreds
of
bales
were
consumed
and
it
seemed
like
a
wholly
unnecessary
destruction
of
property
and
therefore
unwise
as
a
war
measure
many
were
sorry
that
they
had
acquiesced
in
the
policy
as
it
cost
them
thousands
of
dollars
and
made
many
poor
they
thought
that
possibly
their
farms
might
have
escaped
the
visits
of
the
union
soldiers
and
the
property
so
much
needed
been
saved
in
whole
or
in
part
they
reasoned
and
reasoned
correctly
that
their
condition
would
in
no
sense
have
been
worse
if
their
cotton
had
not
been
burned
by
their
own
soldiers
but
might
have
been
much
better
in
many
cases
without
any
real
detriment
to
the
rebel
cause
the
sacrifice
of
the
property
of
their
own
people
by
the
rebel
authorities
was
evidence
of
the
desperation
of
the
condition
of
the
rebellion
and
was
so
regarded
by
not
a
few
at
that
time
those
were
terrible
days
one
could
see
anxiety
written
on
every
face
among
the
whites
the
slaves
even
looked
worried
at
times
though
the
war
meant
so
much
to
them
as
they
were
always
looking
forward
to
freedom
at
its
close
if
the
union
troops
were
successful
my
fourth
runaway
trip
after
i
had
been
working
on
the
farm
about
two
months
and
had
thoroughly
talked
the
matter
over
with
alfred
dandridge
we
planned
to
make
a
careful
and
persistent
effort
to
escape
from
the
land
of
bondage
we
thought
that
as
others
here
and
there
all
through
the
neighborhood
were
going
we
would
make
trial
of
it
my
wife
and
i
were
at
old
master
jacks
and
after
we
had
consulted
with
alfred
and
lydia
his
wife
we
all
concluded
to
go
at
once
alfred
had
been
a
teamster
for
dandridge
for
many
years
and
was
familiar
with
the
road
as
he
had
hauled
cotton
into
memphis
for
his
master
for
so
long
a
time
he
could
hardly
tell
when
he
began
matt
dandridge
was
a
fellow
servant
belonging
to
the
same
man
and
both
had
as
was
not
unusual
taken
their
master
name
or
rather
were
known
by
it
matt
had
learned
of
our
purpose
to
run
away
and
concluded
to
join
our
party
so
one
night
when
all
was
still
we
started
uncle
alfred
as
i
always
called
him
was
to
be
our
leader
he
was
older
than
any
of
the
rest
of
us
and
had
had
a
good
deal
of
experience
we
therefore
all
looked
to
him
in
fact
we
relied
entirely
upon
him
after
we
had
traveled
about
twelve
miles
we
came
to
a
swamp
called
here
we
stopped
as
day
was
dawning
and
settled
down
for
the
day
as
we
could
travel
only
in
the
night
lest
we
should
be
seen
and
caught
we
were
wet
our
clothes
soaked
through
from
the
heavy
dew
we
had
to
travel
through
corn
fields
cotton
patches
oat
fields
and
underbrush
not
daring
to
take
the
main
road
this
is
why
we
were
so
wet
uncle
alfred
traveled
wholly
by
the
stars
they
were
his
guide
he
knew
by
looking
at
them
the
four
cardinal
points
of
the
compass
many
old
slaves
were
guided
in
this
way
when
traveling
in
the
night
and
some
could
tell
the
time
of
night
by
the
position
of
the
stars
we
stayed
in
all
day
and
in
the
evening
when
it
was
dark
enough
we
started
on
again
uncle
alfred
offering
up
a
prayer
to
god
to
guide
us
safely
through
cold
water
was
our
next
stopping
place
and
here
a
difficulty
rose
before
us
that
made
us
fearful
we
had
nothing
to
wear
but
what
we
had
on
and
not
much
of
that
so
had
small
space
for
carrying
anything
and
therefore
had
brought
with
us
only
a
little
bite
to
eat
as
we
had
lived
on
this
small
provision
for
a
day
there
was
now
but
little
left
for
our
increasing
wants
and
the
difficulty
of
securing
anything
from
the
houses
without
danger
of
detection
was
almost
insurmountable
but
we
felt
encouraged
as
we
thought
of
what
we
were
striving
for
and
sped
on
our
way
but
the
way
was
hard
for
sometimes
we
got
completely
stuck
in
brier
patches
and
had
to
turn
and
go
back
in
order
to
find
a
way
out
old
logs
and
driftwood
that
had
been
piled
up
year
after
year
were
other
obstacles
in
our
way
and
one
can
imagine
how
hard
it
was
to
make
our
way
through
such
a
mass
of
brush
and
forest
by
the
dim
light
of
the
stars
as
they
struggled
through
the
dense
branches
of
the
trees
we
stumbled
on
however
as
best
we
could
each
fearful
yet
silently
praying
for
guidance
and
help
when
within
four
or
five
miles
of
cold
water
uncle
alfred
stopped
and
cautioned
us
not
to
speak
above
a
whisper
as
the
rebel
troops
were
camped
on
both
sides
of
us
we
were
in
a
swamp
between
the
two
roads
gradually
working
our
way
through
to
the
river
as
we
could
not
go
on
either
of
the
roads
for
fear
of
detection
at
the
bridges
where
these
roads
crossed
the
river
there
were
rebel
camps
and
it
was
useless
for
us
to
think
of
crossing
either
we
therefore
worked
our
way
carefully
through
the
thicket
that
we
were
in
until
we
came
within
sight
of
the
river
then
uncle
alfred
went
ahead
creeping
a
few
steps
then
stopping
to
see
if
the
river
was
clear
of
soldiers
from
this
point
it
was
some
two
and
a
half
miles
to
the
bridges
each
way
and
it
was
our
idea
that
if
we
could
cross
here
without
being
seen
by
the
soldiers
we
would
be
all
right
uncle
alfred
came
back
to
us
and
told
us
that
he
thought
the
way
was
clear
i
can
not
hear
a
sound
said
he
so
let
us
go
on
we
followed
the
river
down
until
we
came
to
a
place
where
we
could
cross
here
we
found
some
an
old
tree
had
been
blown
down
nearly
across
the
river
leaving
a
space
of
about
twenty
feet
over
this
natural
bridge
we
crept
to
the
open
space
which
we
waded
the
water
being
up
to
our
knees
but
we
did
not
mind
this
there
was
no
talking
above
a
whisper
for
fear
of
being
heard
by
the
soldiers
daylight
had
begun
to
dawn
and
we
felt
good
that
we
had
succeeded
thus
far
we
went
on
quietly
until
we
got
entirely
out
of
the
swamp
and
reached
some
hills
the
woods
were
on
each
side
of
us
and
still
thick
so
we
stopped
here
on
the
side
of
a
hill
where
the
sun
shone
brightly
on
us
expecting
to
rest
for
the
day
our
clothes
had
already
become
quite
dry
from
the
sunshine
and
so
far
we
felt
all
right
alfred
and
i
had
made
a
turn
around
the
place
listening
to
see
if
we
could
hear
any
noise
or
see
any
trace
of
soldiers
but
we
discovered
no
trace
of
them
and
went
back
to
our
stopping
place
i
had
been
asleep
and
some
of
the
others
were
still
asleep
when
suddenly
i
heard
the
yelp
of
blood
hounds
in
the
distance
it
seemed
quite
far
away
at
first
but
the
sound
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
then
we
heard
men
yelling
we
knew
now
that
they
were
on
our
trail
and
became
so
frightened
that
we
all
leaped
to
our
feet
and
were
about
to
run
when
uncle
alfred
said
stop
children
let
me
oil
you
feet
he
had
with
him
a
bottle
of
ointment
made
of
turpentine
and
onions
a
preparation
used
to
throw
hounds
off
a
trail
all
stopped
and
the
women
having
their
feet
anointed
first
started
off
uncle
alfred
telling
them
to
run
in
different
directions
he
and
i
were
the
last
to
start
alfred
said
do
let
the
bushes
touch
you
at
the
same
time
he
ran
through
the
bushes
with
such
a
rattling
noise
one
could
have
heard
him
a
great
distance
he
wore
one
of
those
old
fashioned
oil
cloth
coats
made
in
virginia
and
as
he
ran
the
bushes
striking
against
the
coat
made
a
noise
like
the
beating
of
a
tin
board
with
sticks
the
funny
part
of
it
was
that
having
cautioned
us
to
be
careful
about
noise
he
made
more
than
all
of
us
by
this
time
the
woods
were
resounding
with
the
yelping
of
the
hounds
and
the
cries
of
their
masters
the
hounds
numbered
some
fourteen
the
men
howled
and
cheered
in
concert
with
the
brutes
for
they
knew
that
they
were
on
the
right
trail
and
it
would
be
but
a
short
time
before
they
caught
us
all
i
had
gotten
further
away
than
any
of
them
having
run
about
a
mile
i
came
to
a
farm
and
started
across
an
open
field
hoping
to
reach
a
wood
beyond
where
i
might
conceal
myself
before
i
was
half
way
across
the
field
on
looking
back
i
saw
the
dogs
coming
over
the
fence
and
knowing
there
was
no
chance
of
my
getting
to
the
woods
i
turned
around
and
ran
back
to
a
persimmon
tree
and
just
had
time
to
run
up
one
of
the
branches
when
the
dogs
came
upon
the
ground
i
looked
and
saw
the
men
williams
the
and
henry
and
charles
dandridge
as
soon
as
williams
rode
up
he
told
me
to
come
down
but
i
was
so
frightened
i
began
to
cry
yet
came
down
trembling
the
dogs
laid
hold
of
me
at
once
tearing
my
clothes
and
biting
my
flesh
dandridge
was
just
riding
up
and
seeing
what
was
happening
yelled
out
to
williams
i
thought
your
dogs
did
bite
oh
well
said
williams
he
aint
hurt
we
got
to
let
bite
a
little
they
took
us
all
back
to
the
fence
where
i
crossed
over
all
the
others
having
been
caught
our
hearts
were
filled
with
dismay
all
looked
as
if
they
were
condemned
to
be
hung
we
knew
not
what
was
to
be
done
with
us
the
women
were
pitiful
to
see
crying
and
moaning
all
courage
utterly
gone
they
started
back
with
us
to
old
master
jack
at
panola
and
we
stopped
for
the
night
at
a
small
farm
house
the
old
woman
who
kept
it
said
tauntingly
you
niggers
going
to
the
yankees
you
all
ought
to
be
killed
we
started
on
the
following
morning
and
got
back
home
at
one
in
the
afternoon
all
of
us
were
whipped
all
the
members
of
the
family
were
very
angry
old
lady
jack
mcgee
was
so
enraged
that
she
said
to
my
wife
i
thought
you
were
a
christian
you
never
see
your
god
she
seemed
to
think
that
because
matilda
had
sought
freedom
she
had
committed
a
great
sin
incidents
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
and
the
slaves
had
heard
that
possibly
they
might
some
time
be
free
they
seemed
unspeakably
happy
they
were
afraid
to
let
the
masters
know
that
they
ever
thought
of
such
a
thing
and
they
never
dreamed
of
speaking
about
it
except
among
themselves
they
were
a
happy
race
poor
souls
notwithstanding
their
condition
they
would
laugh
and
chat
about
freedom
in
their
cabins
and
many
a
little
rhyme
about
it
originated
among
them
and
was
softly
sung
over
their
work
i
remember
a
song
that
aunt
kitty
the
cook
at
master
jack
used
to
sing
it
ran
something
like
this
there
be
no
more
talk
about
monday
by
and
by
but
every
day
will
be
sunday
by
and
by
the
old
woman
was
singing
or
rather
humming
it
one
day
and
old
lady
mcgee
heard
her
she
was
busy
getting
her
dinner
and
i
suppose
never
realized
she
was
singing
such
an
incendiary
piece
when
old
mcgee
broke
in
upon
her
do
think
you
are
going
to
be
free
you
darkies
were
made
by
god
and
ordained
to
wait
upon
us
those
passages
of
scripture
which
refer
to
master
and
servants
were
always
cited
to
us
when
we
heard
the
word
preached
and
they
were
interpreted
as
meaning
that
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
was
right
and
proper
that
they
were
rightly
the
masters
and
we
the
slaves
i
remember
not
long
after
jeff
davis
had
been
elected
president
of
the
confederacy
that
i
happened
to
hear
old
master
jack
talking
to
some
of
the
members
of
the
family
about
the
war
etc
all
at
once
the
old
man
broke
out
and
what
do
you
think
that
rascal
abraham
lincoln
has
called
for
more
men
what
is
jeff
davis
he
talked
on
and
seemed
so
angry
that
he
gave
no
one
a
chance
to
answer
jeff
davis
is
a
grand
said
he
he
ought
to
go
into
the
field
himself
at
first
all
the
southerners
were
jubilant
over
davis
but
as
they
were
losing
so
and
the
unionists
gaining
they
grew
angry
and
denounced
him
oftentimes
in
unsparing
terms
union
raid
at
master
farm
during
the
time
the
union
headquarters
were
at
helena
a
union
came
down
the
river
as
far
as
boliva
and
stopped
at
miles
mcgee
the
soldiers
made
a
raid
through
the
farm
taking
chickens
turkeys
meat
and
everything
that
they
could
lay
hands
on
during
this
raid
miles
mcgee
came
out
of
the
house
with
a
gun
and
shot
the
commanding
officer
of
the
party
he
became
alarmed
over
what
he
had
done
and
hid
in
the
cabin
of
one
of
the
servants
he
never
came
near
the
house
the
union
soldiers
came
three
different
times
to
catch
him
but
never
succeeded
the
last
time
they
came
he
made
for
the
canebrake
and
hid
himself
there
until
they
were
gone
but
though
he
had
escaped
their
righteous
vengeance
he
became
so
nervous
that
he
left
his
hiding
place
in
the
canebraker
and
went
to
atlanta
and
staid
there
among
friends
until
things
became
more
quiet
at
last
wearying
of
this
he
determined
to
return
to
old
master
jack
but
not
to
his
own
home
word
had
been
received
of
his
coming
and
great
preparations
were
made
for
his
reception
after
he
had
started
on
his
return
he
was
taken
ill
on
the
train
and
was
left
at
a
small
town
called
jackson
where
he
soon
died
i
drove
the
family
to
the
depot
upon
the
day
of
his
expected
arrival
and
as
the
train
came
in
the
women
waved
their
handkerchiefs
and
when
the
conductor
stepped
off
they
asked
him
if
mcgee
was
aboard
he
said
no
i
have
his
remains
the
scene
that
followed
i
can
not
describe
such
wailing
and
screaming
i
could
not
but
feel
sad
even
though
they
had
treated
me
so
meanly
causing
the
death
of
my
children
and
separating
me
from
my
wife
their
grief
was
indeed
great
the
sad
news
was
conveyed
to
his
mother
old
jack
mcgee
at
the
house
by
an
advance
messenger
and
we
soon
followed
with
the
body
he
was
the
favorite
son
of
his
mother
and
her
grief
was
very
great
but
for
his
wanton
shooting
of
the
union
officer
he
would
probably
not
have
met
his
death
as
he
did
union
soldiers
pass
the
panola
home
one
winter
night
while
i
was
at
old
master
jack
i
was
awakened
by
a
rumbling
noise
like
that
of
heavy
wagons
which
continued
steadily
and
so
long
a
time
that
i
finally
concluded
it
must
be
an
army
passing
and
such
i
found
to
be
the
case
upon
getting
up
and
venturing
out
the
rumbling
which
had
awakened
me
being
caused
by
the
passing
artillery
i
was
afraid
to
go
out
straight
to
the
soldiers
but
would
take
a
few
steps
at
a
time
then
stop
and
listen
behind
a
tree
or
the
shrubbery
all
seemed
quiet
there
was
no
talking
i
had
listened
about
twenty
minutes
when
there
seemed
to
be
a
halt
at
the
creek
some
distance
from
the
house
soon
afterwords
i
heard
the
command
given
forward
i
at
once
made
up
my
mind
that
they
were
yankee
soldiers
i
got
on
my
knees
and
crawled
to
the
fence
not
daring
to
go
openly
fearing
that
they
might
hear
or
see
me
and
shoot
supposing
me
to
be
a
spy
i
went
back
into
the
house
and
told
my
wife
that
they
were
yankees
who
had
just
passed
uncle
george
said
i
this
would
be
a
good
time
for
us
to
go
oh
no
said
he
we
are
not
quite
ready
uncle
george
cabin
was
where
my
wife
and
i
stayed
while
at
old
master
jack
in
the
morning
i
was
to
carry
a
parcel
to
como
a
place
not
far
from
home
to
james
mcgee
who
was
in
the
rebel
army
it
was
not
quite
daylight
when
i
made
ready
to
go
on
my
trip
for
i
was
anxious
to
find
out
more
about
the
soldiers
going
to
the
stable
and
saddling
my
horse
i
mounted
and
rode
out
to
the
big
gate
leading
to
the
main
road
just
as
day
was
dawning
as
i
dismounted
to
open
the
gate
some
soldiers
were
passing
and
an
officer
sung
out
to
me
hello
which
way
are
you
going
i
said
to
como
to
carry
this
parcel
of
clothing
to
my
young
master
in
the
war
you
have
a
fine
horse
said
the
officer
i
guess
i
will
exchange
horses
with
you
he
took
my
package
of
clothing
and
some
letters
which
i
had
to
mail
and
my
horse
leaving
me
his
which
was
a
very
poor
animal
i
was
badly
scared
at
this
performance
fearing
that
i
would
be
severely
whipped
for
the
loss
of
the
horse
and
package
yet
how
could
i
help
it
we
knew
nothing
but
to
serve
a
white
man
no
matter
what
he
asked
or
commanded
as
a
matter
of
course
i
did
not
go
to
como
as
i
had
nothing
to
take
the
officer
had
everything
but
went
back
to
the
cabin
i
supposed
that
the
soldiers
had
all
passed
but
in
about
half
an
hour
aunt
kitty
on
looking
out
of
her
cabin
window
exclaimed
my
god
just
look
at
the
soldiers
the
yard
was
covered
with
the
blue
coats
another
venerable
slave
said
my
lord
de
year
of
jubilee
am
come
during
the
excitement
i
ran
to
the
big
house
and
told
the
madam
that
the
yankees
were
there
and
had
taken
my
horse
and
every
thing
i
had
old
master
jack
had
heard
the
news
but
was
not
able
to
come
out
he
had
arisen
but
when
he
knew
of
the
presence
of
the
yankees
he
went
back
to
bed
calling
for
kitty
to
get
him
a
mush
poultice
tell
to
get
me
a
mush
it
was
customary
after
the
beginning
of
the
war
for
him
to
take
sick
and
call
for
a
poultice
to
be
put
upon
his
stomach
whenever
he
heard
of
the
yankees
being
near
he
and
many
like
him
were
especially
valorous
only
when
the
blue
coats
were
far
away
the
soldiers
went
into
the
dairy
and
drank
all
the
milk
helped
themselves
to
butter
cheese
meat
bread
and
everything
in
sight
which
they
wanted
nothing
was
said
to
them
by
the
white
folks
but
the
slaves
were
glad
and
whispered
to
each
other
ah
we
goin
to
be
free
old
master
jack
lying
on
his
couch
would
ask
every
little
while
where
are
they
are
they
gone
after
they
had
all
left
the
premises
he
said
my
god
i
ca
stand
it
them
are
just
through
the
country
destroyin
everything
i
was
sent
down
to
get
uncle
peter
for
old
master
and
when
peter
came
up
the
old
man
asked
well
did
any
of
the
servants
go
away
and
sir
them
devils
took
louis
horse
and
the
clothes
he
had
for
his
young
master
hiding
valuables
from
the
yankees
right
after
this
the
mcgees
commenced
planning
to
put
away
their
valuables
to
keep
them
from
the
union
soldiers
all
the
servants
had
to
fill
up
their
with
fine
gin
cotton
the
lint
part
for
safe
keeping
great
boxes
and
barrels
were
packed
full
of
their
best
things
and
put
into
the
cellar
under
the
house
it
was
not
exactly
a
cellar
but
a
large
shallow
excavation
which
held
a
great
deal
we
put
all
the
solid
silver
ware
such
as
cake
baskets
trays
spoons
forks
dishes
in
boxes
and
buried
them
under
the
hen
house
great
packages
of
the
finest
clothing
i
had
to
make
up
and
these
were
given
in
charge
of
certain
servants
whose
duty
it
was
to
run
into
the
big
house
and
get
them
whenever
they
heard
that
the
yankees
were
coming
and
take
them
to
their
cabins
this
was
a
shrewd
arrangement
for
the
soldiers
never
went
into
the
cabins
to
get
anything
when
the
soldiers
had
passed
these
packages
were
taken
back
to
the
house
it
speaks
well
for
the
honesty
and
faithfulness
of
the
slaves
that
such
trusts
could
be
devolved
upon
them
notwithstanding
all
the
cruelties
inflicted
upon
them
by
their
masters
death
to
runaway
slaves
it
was
about
this
time
that
the
law
or
regulation
of
the
rebel
government
was
promulgated
authorizing
or
directing
the
shooting
or
hanging
of
any
slave
caught
trying
to
get
away
to
the
union
army
this
barbarous
law
was
carried
out
in
many
cases
for
every
little
while
we
would
hear
of
some
slave
who
was
caught
running
away
and
hung
or
shot
a
slave
belonging
to
boss
ran
away
and
got
safely
within
the
union
lines
but
he
returned
to
get
his
sister
they
both
got
away
from
the
house
but
had
gone
only
a
few
miles
when
william
mcgee
overtook
them
and
shot
the
man
dead
william
boasted
of
this
but
told
uncle
peter
the
foreman
that
he
never
wanted
it
mentioned
slaves
hung
and
left
to
rot
as
a
warning
two
slaves
belonging
to
one
wallace
one
of
our
nearest
neighbors
had
tried
to
escape
to
the
union
soldiers
but
were
caught
brought
back
and
hung
all
of
our
servants
were
called
up
told
every
detail
of
the
runaway
and
capture
of
the
poor
creatures
and
their
shocking
murder
and
then
compelled
to
go
and
see
them
where
they
hung
i
never
shall
forget
the
horror
of
the
scene
it
was
sickening
the
bodies
hung
at
the
roadside
where
the
execution
took
place
until
the
blue
flies
literally
swarmed
around
them
and
the
stench
was
fearful
this
barbarous
spectacle
was
for
the
purpose
of
showing
the
passing
slaves
what
would
be
the
fate
of
those
caught
in
the
attempt
to
escape
and
to
secure
the
circulation
of
the
details
of
the
awful
affair
among
them
throughout
all
the
neighborhood
it
is
difficult
at
this
day
for
those
not
familiar
with
the
atrocities
of
the
institution
of
slavery
to
believe
that
such
scenes
could
ever
have
been
witnessed
in
this
or
any
other
civilized
land
as
a
result
simply
of
a
human
being
effort
to
reach
a
portion
of
the
country
where
the
freedom
of
which
it
was
said
to
be
the
home
could
be
enjoyed
without
molestation
yet
such
was
the
horrible
truth
in
not
one
case
alone
but
in
many
as
i
know
only
too
well
runaway
slave
caught
and
whipped
one
day
while
i
was
waiting
at
dinner
some
of
the
children
from
the
slave
quarters
came
running
into
the
house
and
said
to
old
master
jack
uncle
john
is
going
away
he
is
down
to
the
creek
he
had
been
put
in
the
carpenter
shop
fastened
in
the
stocks
but
by
some
means
he
had
gotten
the
stocks
off
his
feet
and
got
loose
all
in
the
house
immediately
got
up
and
ran
out
old
master
told
me
to
run
and
catch
the
runaway
i
did
not
like
to
do
it
but
had
to
obey
old
master
and
i
ran
in
pursuit
and
soon
overtook
him
he
could
not
run
as
the
stocks
were
still
on
his
arms
and
neck
we
brought
him
back
and
he
was
staked
out
that
is
four
stakes
were
driven
into
the
ground
the
arms
tied
to
two
and
the
legs
to
the
other
two
he
was
then
paddled
with
the
whipping
paddle
upon
the
bottom
of
his
feet
by
old
master
jack
until
blood
blisters
arose
when
he
took
his
knife
and
opened
them
i
was
then
sent
for
salt
and
water
and
the
bruises
of
the
suffering
chattel
were
washed
as
usual
in
the
stinging
brine
a
home
guard
accidentally
shoots
himself
after
the
capture
of
memphis
by
the
union
forces
the
soldiers
were
in
the
habit
of
making
raids
into
the
surrounding
country
these
were
a
source
of
alarm
and
anxiety
among
the
people
and
they
were
constantly
on
the
watch
to
defend
their
property
and
themselves
as
best
they
could
one
day
charles
dandridge
went
over
to
one
of
our
neighbors
bobor
to
practice
shooting
and
to
see
if
he
had
heard
anything
new
about
the
war
it
was
the
custom
of
the
to
meet
weekly
and
practice
with
their
in
order
to
be
the
better
prepared
as
they
pretended
for
any
sudden
incursion
of
the
now
dreaded
yankee
bobor
had
gotten
a
yankee
pistol
from
some
friend
who
was
in
the
army
and
charles
wanted
to
see
and
try
it
it
was
shown
him
and
its
workings
explained
he
took
it
and
began
shooting
and
in
showing
the
other
men
how
quickly
he
could
shoot
a
yankee
and
mount
his
horse
he
accidentally
shot
himself
under
the
short
rib
near
his
heart
and
fell
to
the
ground
all
the
men
came
running
to
him
picked
him
up
and
carried
him
into
the
house
immediately
sending
word
to
dandridge
and
master
jack
mcgee
his
the
boys
came
hurrying
in
and
told
us
what
had
happened
i
hitched
up
and
drove
boss
over
to
bobor
we
found
the
wounded
man
rapidly
sinking
and
when
a
little
later
his
wife
came
he
could
not
speak
only
clasped
her
hand
he
died
that
night
and
we
carried
his
body
to
the
home
which
so
short
a
time
before
he
had
left
in
health
and
high
spirits
no
casket
was
to
be
had
everything
of
that
kind
had
been
consumed
or
shut
out
by
the
war
accordingly
two
slaves
were
ordered
to
make
a
coffin
which
they
did
using
plain
boards
it
was
then
covered
with
black
alpaca
from
a
dress
of
the
madam
and
lined
with
the
cloth
from
dandridge
opera
cloak
the
regular
material
used
for
these
purposes
was
not
to
be
had
by
the
time
the
coffin
was
ready
the
body
was
so
bloated
that
it
could
not
be
got
into
it
resort
was
then
had
to
a
plain
box
and
in
this
the
body
of
another
of
the
stricken
family
group
was
laid
away
at
the
suggestion
of
old
master
jack
the
coffin
was
put
up
in
the
carriage
house
for
safe
keeping
he
saying
it
would
do
for
him
to
be
buried
in
sorrow
had
come
to
this
family
with
such
crushing
force
that
their
former
pride
and
boastful
spirit
had
given
place
to
utter
dejection
substitutes
for
coffee
during
the
war
everything
was
scarce
and
dear
and
substitutes
were
devised
for
many
of
those
things
which
had
formerly
been
regarded
as
the
necessaries
of
life
sweet
potatoes
were
peeled
then
cut
in
small
pieces
and
put
out
in
the
sun
to
dry
they
were
then
used
as
a
substitute
for
coffee
when
that
article
became
so
scarce
toward
the
close
of
the
war
great
quantities
of
this
preparation
were
used
okra
was
another
substitute
for
coffee
it
was
dried
in
the
pod
then
the
seeds
shelled
out
and
these
were
dried
again
and
prepared
something
as
the
coffee
is
this
made
a
delicious
drink
when
served
with
cream
being
very
rich
and
pleasant
to
the
taste
quinine
was
a
medicine
that
had
been
of
almost
universal
use
in
the
south
yet
it
became
so
scarce
that
it
was
sold
at
seven
dollars
a
bottle
and
could
not
often
be
had
at
that
price
lemon
leaves
were
used
as
a
substitute
in
cases
of
chills
and
fever
the
leaves
were
made
into
a
tea
and
given
to
the
patient
hot
to
produce
perspiration
during
an
attack
of
chills
i
was
treated
in
this
manner
to
some
advantage
at
any
rate
i
got
well
which
can
not
always
be
said
of
all
methods
of
treatment

while
i
was
absent
on
my
last
runaway
trip
the
yankees
had
made
a
raid
through
panola
and
our
people
had
become
greatly
frightened
as
soon
as
they
had
got
back
with
me
and
my
fellow
runaways
they
assembled
a
gang
of
slaves
for
the
purpose
of
taking
them
to
atlanta
to
get
them
out
of
the
reach
of
the
union
soldiers
among
the
slaves
selected
for
the
transfer
were
myself
my
wife
matilda
and
the
seamstress
the
others
all
belonged
to
dandridge
and
blanton
mcgee
both
the
drs
dandridge
went
with
us
to
atlanta
we
traveled
across
the
country
until
we
came
to
demopolis
alabama
where
we
found
boss
camped
on
the
bank
of
the
tombigbee
river
with
all
the
farm
slaves
from
bolivar
county
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
boss
since
he
was
captured
and
taken
to
helena
as
my
wife
and
i
were
the
only
ones
in
the
gang
who
belonged
to
boss
we
left
those
with
whom
we
had
come
and
joined
his
gang
we
all
then
went
aboard
a
boat
and
were
taken
to
the
salt
works
situated
on
the
tombigbee
ninety
miles
from
mobile
these
salt
works
belonged
to
the
rebel
government
the
first
president
of
the
works
was
woolsey
of
salem
alabama
during
woolsey
term
the
first
part
of
when
we
had
been
there
some
time
he
wrote
to
boss
asking
if
he
would
sell
myself
and
wife
and
offering
for
both
of
us
boss
was
indignant
at
this
and
curtly
refused
my
wife
acted
as
cook
at
the
salt
works
in
the
headquarters
for
the
president
managers
and
clerks
woolsey
was
delighted
with
her
cooking
her
bread
and
rolls
he
said
could
not
be
surpassed

scheme
when
the
election
of
officers
of
the
works
came
off
in
the
fall
gallatin
mcgee
was
chosen
president
boss
then
hired
us
all
about
in
number
to
labor
in
these
works
but
he
of
course
received
all
the
revenue
the
work
assigned
me
was
that
of
butler
at
headquarters
and
my
wife
was
cook
both
women
and
children
as
well
as
men
were
employed
in
these
works
after
some
months
labor
here
soon
after
gallatin
mcgee
became
president
matilda
and
i
were
removed
to
the
montgomery
headquarters
where
we
remained
until
nearly
christmas
a
few
days
before
that
time
boss
came
to
montgomery
and
arranged
for
us
to
meet
him
in
mobile
we
started
at
the
appointed
time
reached
the
city
in
the
morning
and
i
went
directly
to
the
hotel
where
he
told
me
he
would
be
i
found
him
at
once
and
he
informed
me
all
about
his
plans
for
the
future
and
what
he
expected
to
accomplish
he
had
purchased
an
island
in
the
bay
a
little
way
from
mobile
where
he
had
decided
to
establish
salt
works
of
his
own
all
the
brick
and
lumber
for
the
buildings
had
been
carried
there
and
work
upon
them
was
to
be
commenced
immediately
after
christmas
he
intended
to
make
a
home
for
the
family
on
the
island
and
as
soon
as
he
could
complete
the
works
to
remove
all
his
hands
from
the
government
works
to
his
own
he
was
very
enthusiastic
over
this
scheme
claiming
that
he
would
make
far
more
money
by
it
than
he
was
then
receiving
from
hiring
out
his
slaves
he
told
me
that
he
would
remain
in
mobile
two
or
three
days
and
would
go
to
panola
to
spend
the
holidays
after
which
he
intended
to
bring
all
the
family
to
mobile
and
remain
there
until
the
island
was
in
readiness
to
be
occupied
there
was
to
be
a
general
break
up
of
the
old
home
and
the
beginning
of
a
new
manner
of
life
i
stayed
in
his
room
at
the
hotel
all
the
forenoon
listening
to
his
plans
then
i
went
back
where
my
wife
was
stopping
as
i
left
his
room
he
said
lou
as
he
always
called
me
i
will
see
you
and
matilda
at
the
boat
this
evening
we
went
to
the
boat
at
the
appointed
time
and
saw
the
boss
but
he
did
not
come
near
us
as
the
boat
was
about
to
put
off
i
looked
and
saw
him
walking
up
and
down
the
levee
apparently
much
excited
running
his
hands
nervously
through
his
hair
a
habit
common
to
him
when
he
was
worried
he
seemed
greatly
distressed
the
military
situation
troubled
him
for
the
union
army
had
conquered
nearly
everything
and
the
fact
now
stared
him
in
the
face
that
he
would
soon
lose
his
slaves
he
never
dreamed
in
the
beginning
of
the
war
that
the
unionists
would
conquer
and
that
the
slaves
would
be
freed
but
now
he
saw
that
not
only
all
his
wealth
in
the
bodies
and
souls
of
men
was
slipping
away
from
him
but
that
much
if
not
all
of
the
gain
which
these
chattels
had
brought
him
was
likely
to
take
wings
and
fly
away
death
we
returned
to
the
salt
works
the
morning
after
leaving
mobile
boss
remained
two
days
in
mobile
and
then
started
for
panola
the
home
of
his
but
on
his
way
he
was
taken
sick
having
contracted
a
heavy
cold
which
ran
into
pneumonia
and
he
lasted
only
a
short
time
dying
on
new
year
day
he
had
taken
cold
in
bringing
the
slaves
from
bolivar
over
the
river
on
barges
the
river
was
overflowed
about
fifty
miles
out
and
the
only
way
he
could
get
the
slaves
across
was
by
using
large
barges
made
of
logs
they
were
several
days
floating
down
in
this
way
before
he
could
get
out
to
the
railroad
at
jackson
where
he
transferred
them
to
the
cars
this
was
too
much
of
an
exposure
and
it
killed
him
after
boss
died
all
the
plans
were
changed
col
hunting
of
old
master
jack
came
down
to
the
salt
works
and
hired
us
all
out
there
for
another
year
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
year
of
plans
concerning
the
island
and
his
proposed
salt
works
the
family
knew
little
for
they
questioned
me
close
as
to
what
he
told
me
of
the
matter
what
he
spent
on
the
island
in
lumber
brick
was
lost
as
they
knew
nothing
of
the
particulars
of
the
expenditure
the
madam
remained
at
her
fathers
and
the
slaves
at
the
works
i
make
some
money
as
i
was
here
for
another
year
acting
as
butler
i
thought
i
would
try
and
see
if
i
could
not
make
some
money
for
myself
i
asked
brooks
the
manager
of
the
works
if
he
could
get
me
some
tobacco
by
sending
to
mobile
for
it
he
said
he
could
and
on
the
fourth
day
thereafter
in
the
evening
it
came
i
was
anxious
to
get
it
the
same
evening
but
brooks
said
oh
i
guess
you
had
better
wait
until
morning
then
when
you
finish
your
work
come
down
to
the
office
and
get
it
you
will
then
have
more
time
to
see
the
boys
in
the
works
in
the
morning
i
was
up
early
and
after
doing
my
morning
work
i
was
off
to
brooks
office
when
i
went
in
he
said
there
it
is
under
the
table
the
package
was
so
small
i
felt
disappointed
a
hundred
dollars
worth
ought
to
be
more
said
i
to
myself
but
i
took
it
and
went
out
among
the
men
i
thought
i
would
try
to
sell
it
at
five
dollars
a
plug
and
if
i
could
not
sell
it
at
that
i
would
take
four
dollars
i
must
make
something
for
i
had
borrowed
the
money
to
buy
it
with
and
i
saw
that
to
clear
anything
on
it
i
must
at
least
get
four
dollars
a
plug
the
money
which
i
had
borrowed
was
from
three
fellow
servants
who
had
been
fortunate
in
earning
some
little
time
and
had
saved
their
money
the
first
man
i
met
in
the
works
bought
two
plugs
at
five
dollars
each
and
after
i
had
been
there
about
an
hour
all
was
sold
so
i
went
back
with
a
light
heart
brooks
said
to
me
at
dinner
well
how
did
you
get
along
with
your
tobacco
i
did
very
well
i
said
the
only
trouble
was
i
did
not
have
enough
i
sold
it
for
well
said
he
if
you
did
you
made
more
clear
money
than
the
works
here
how
much
a
plug
did
you
sell
it
for
at
the
same
time
drawing
out
his
pencil
and
commencing
to
figure
it
up
i
had
plugs
said
i
and
i
sold
them
for
five
dollars
a
plug
nothing
more
was
said
just
then
but
after
dinner
brooks
and
two
of
the
clerks
went
out
on
the
veranda
to
smoke
when
they
were
in
a
good
way
smoking
brooks
slipped
into
the
dining
room
and
said
well
that
was
fine
you
got
five
dollars
a
plug
for
the
tobacco
oh
yes
i
said
tobacco
is
scarce
and
they
were
hungry
for
it
it
went
like
hot
cakes
the
price
was
not
questioned
i
sold
at
once
what
is
the
prospect
for
selling
more
he
asked
will
you
sell
it
for
half
the
profit
if
i
furnish
the
tobacco
i
said
yes
so
he
sent
the
same
day
for
a
box
of
tobacco
about
five
hundred
plugs
when
the
tobacco
came
the
box
was
sawed
in
two
and
sent
up
to
my
room
i
put
some
fellows
out
as
agents
to
sell
for
me
uncle
hudson
who
took
care
of
the
horses
and
mules
at
the
works
john
at
the
hospital
william
head
chopper
among
the
men
in
the
woods
each
brought
in
from
to
every
two
or
three
days
and
took
another
supply
sometimes
when
i
had
finished
my
work
in
the
afternoon
i
would
get
an
old
pony
and
go
around
through
the
neighborhood
and
sell
four
or
five
plugs
it
was
a
mystery
to
the
servants
how
i
got
the
tobacco
but
i
did
not
let
on
that
brooks
was
backing
me
in
two
weeks
we
had
taken
in
and
i
was
happy
as
i
could
be
brooks
was
a
fine
fellow
a
northerner
by
birth
and
did
just
what
he
said
he
would
i
received
of
the
money
of
course
this
was
all
rebel
money
but
i
was
sharp
and
bought
up
all
the
silver
i
could
find
just
as
we
got
on
the
other
half
of
the
box
brooks
received
word
that
the
yankees
were
coming
and
to
send
all
the
hands
to
their
masters
i
was
glad
that
i
had
made
some
money
knowing
that
i
would
need
it
if
i
gained
my
freedom
which
i
now
knew
was
quite
probable
as
the
union
forces
were
gaining
ground
everywhere
but
the
message
ended
my
and
i
prepared
to
go
home
to
panola
going
back
to
panola
brooks
fixed
the
return
papers
so
that
my
wife
and
i
could
leave
the
party
of
slaves
at
demopolis
and
go
on
thence
to
panola
by
rail
to
convey
the
news
to
madam
that
all
hands
were
coming
home
that
the
yankees
were
expected
to
capture
the
salt
works
within
a
short
time
at
jackson
some
seven
miles
from
the
salt
works
we
were
delayed
over
night
by
reason
of
lack
of
facilities
for
crossing
the
tombigbee
river
the
report
that
the
yankees
were
coming
through
had
created
a
panic
among
the
white
people
and
hundreds
fleeing
from
their
homes
had
gathered
at
the
river
waiting
and
clamoring
for
an
opportunity
to
cross
though
slaves
were
property
and
valuable
on
that
account
the
whites
seemed
to
think
that
their
own
lives
were
in
danger
and
to
be
protected
first
they
therefore
took
precedence
of
us
in
the
morning
about
seven
a
steamer
was
seen
coming
at
a
distance
but
it
could
not
be
discovered
at
once
just
what
the
character
of
it
was
the
whites
became
alarmed
some
said
the
yankees
are
coming
other
said
it
is
a
gun
boat
they
will
surely
fire
on
us
but
as
the
boat
drew
near
the
people
saw
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
it
was
only
the
regular
passenger
boat
besides
the
hundreds
of
people
there
were
scores
of
wagons
filled
with
household
goods
to
go
over
and
the
passage
was
slow
and
tedious
we
finally
got
across
and
traveled
as
far
as
demopolis
where
matilda
and
i
left
the
other
slaves
and
took
a
train
and
went
on
to
panola
i
delivered
the
papers
to
the
madam
from
brooks
which
told
her
all
the
particulars
concerning
the
break
up
at
the
salt
works
she
sent
wagons
right
away
after
the
other
slaves
who
were
coming
back
on
foot
they
were
not
brought
back
to
panola
but
were
hired
out
to
different
farmers
along
the
road
home
some
in
jackson
some
in
granda
and
others
in
panola
town
these
were
all
small
towns
in
mississippi
my
wife
and
i
went
to
work
at
old
master
jack
i
on
the
farm
and
my
wife
at
her
old
duties
in
the
house
we
longed
for
freedom
but
were
content
for
the
time
with
hoping
and
praying
for
the
coming
of
the
day
when
it
should
be
realized
it
was
sad
to
see
the
changes
that
had
come
to
the
white
folks
sorrow
had
left
its
impress
upon
all
and
we
felt
it
notwithstanding
all
that
we
had
suffered
at
their
hands
boss
had
willed
the
homestead
in
memphis
to
farrington
and
she
was
getting
ready
to
take
possession
he
had
borrowed
a
great
amount
of
money
from
her
when
he
bought
the
island
at
mobile
and
the
rapid
coming
on
of
the
end
of
the
rebellion
destroyed
all
prospect
of
the
success
of
his
salt
works
scheme
even
before
his
death
and
really
rendered
him
bankrupt
hence
the
transfer
of
the
memphis
property
to
her
was
the
only
way
he
could
make
good
what
he
owed
her
the
madam
now
had
no
home
but
was
compelled
to
stay
with
her
father
old
master
jack
she
was
sadly
changed
did
not
appear
like
the
same
person
her
troubles
and
sorrows
had
crushed
her
former
cruel
and
haughty
spirit
her
mother
had
died
a
few
months
before
and
then
her
husband
had
followed
dying
suddenly
and
away
from
home
then
much
of
her
property
had
been
lost
and
social
pleasures
and
distinction
were
gone
forever
who
shall
say
that
the
wrongs
done
her
poor
helpless
slaves
were
not
avenged
in
this
life
the
last
i
knew
of
her
she
was
still
at
her
father
incidents
a
servant
who
belonged
to
dandridge
ran
away
and
got
to
memphis
just
after
it
was
captured
by
the
union
soldiers
he
was
put
into
the
army
and
was
stationed
at
one
of
the
entrances
to
the
city
he
was
to
halt
all
persons
passing
to
or
from
the
city
no
difference
who
they
were
and
learn
their
names
and
their
business
young
william
mcgee
and
his
sister
miss
cherry
one
day
went
up
to
memphis
and
to
their
surprise
were
halted
by
this
former
servant
of
their
uncle
when
they
came
home
they
were
speaking
of
it
to
their
father
and
old
master
jack
said
and
you
halted
did
you
why
yes
replied
william
we
had
to
do
it
well
said
the
old
man
i
would
have
before
i
would
have
done
it
to
think
that
a
servant
should
have
halted
you
and
one
who
has
belonged
to
the
family
like
anderson
this
old
man
notwithstanding
all
his
boasting
in
the
absence
of
immediate
danger
was
the
veriest
coward
when
danger
was
present
and
if
he
had
been
in
the
place
of
young
william
he
would
have
halted
with
the
greatest
alacrity
while
at
the
salt
works
i
had
a
little
experience
at
nursing
a
fellow
slave
was
taken
ill
and
i
was
called
on
to
care
for
him
at
night
i
always
liked
this
work
it
was
a
pleasure
to
me
to
be
in
the
sick
room
typhoid
fever
was
a
new
case
to
me
but
i
remembered
what
instructions
boss
had
given
me
about
it
i
pitched
in
to
do
what
i
could
but
the
fever
was
so
great
he
lasted
only
a
few
days
my
fifth
strike
for
freedom
is
a
success
we
had
remained
at
old
jack
until
june
and
had
tried
to
be
content
the
union
soldiers
were
still
raiding
all
through
that
section
every
day
some
town
would
be
taken
and
the
slaves
would
secretly
rejoice
after
we
came
back
from
alabama
we
were
held
with
a
tighter
rein
than
ever
we
were
not
allowed
to
go
outside
of
the
premises
george
washington
a
fellow
servant
and
kitty
his
wife
and
i
had
talked
considerably
about
the
yankees
and
how
we
might
get
away
we
knew
it
was
our
right
to
be
free
for
the
proclamation
had
long
been
issued
yet
they
still
held
us
i
did
not
talk
much
to
my
wife
about
going
away
as
she
was
always
so
afraid
i
would
be
killed
and
did
not
want
me
to
try
any
more
to
escape
but
george
his
wife
and
i
continued
to
discuss
the
matter
whenever
we
had
a
chance
we
knew
that
memphis
was
headquarters
for
the
union
troops
but
how
to
reach
it
was
the
great
question
it
was
sunday
and
i
had
driven
one
portion
of
the
family
to
church
and
george
the
other
the
family
was
now
very
large
as
the
madam
and
her
family
were
there
in
addition
to
old
master
jack
and
all
could
not
go
in
one
carriage
on
the
way
back
young
william
mcgee
came
up
through
the
farm
on
horseback
a
nearer
way
home
from
church
and
encountered
several
servants
belonging
to
some
of
the
neighbors
he
asked
them
what
they
were
doing
there
and
if
they
had
passes
to
this
last
question
all
answered
no
well
said
he
never
come
here
again
without
having
passes
all
of
you
at
this
they
all
quickly
disappeared
when
old
jack
came
home
will
told
him
what
had
passed
and
he
immediately
called
for
george
and
uncle
peter
the
foreman
and
told
them
that
no
one
not
belonging
there
was
to
come
into
the
quarters
without
a
pass
and
any
servant
with
a
pass
should
be
brought
to
the
house
that
the
pass
might
be
inspected
they
thought
or
feared
that
if
the
servants
were
permitted
to
come
together
freely
they
might
plan
ways
of
escape
and
communicate
to
each
other
what
they
knew
about
the
war
and
the
yankees
george
came
out
and
finding
me
told
me
what
they
had
said
no
slave
from
outside
is
to
be
allowed
on
the
place
said
he
i
replied
if
we
listen
to
them
we
shall
be
here
until
christmas
comes
again
what
do
you
mean
asked
george
i
mean
that
now
today
is
the
time
to
make
a
start
so
late
in
the
afternoon
during
the
servants
prayer
meeting
of
which
i
have
heretofore
spoken
we
thought
would
be
a
good
time
to
get
away
as
no
one
would
be
likely
to
see
us
we
talked
with
john
smith
another
servant
and
told
him
all
about
our
plan
asking
him
not
to
say
a
word
about
our
being
gone
until
he
was
through
feeding
the
stock
this
would
give
us
another
hour
to
advance
on
our
journey
as
the
feeding
usually
took
about
that
time
from
six
until
seven
our
fear
was
that
we
might
be
overtaken
by
the
bloodhounds
and
therefore
we
wished
to
get
as
far
away
as
possible
before
the
white
people
knew
we
were
gone
it
was
sunday
afternoon
june
when
george
and
i
having
made
ready
for
the
start
for
the
union
lines
went
to
bid
our
wives
i
told
my
wife
to
cheer
up
as
i
was
coming
again
to
get
her
i
said
to
kitty
george
wife
we
are
going
but
look
for
us
again
it
will
not
be
with
us
as
with
so
many
others
who
have
gone
away
leaving
their
families
and
never
returning
for
them
we
will
be
here
again
she
looked
up
at
me
smiling
and
with
a
look
of
resolution
said
i
be
ready
she
was
of
a
firm
daring
nature
i
did
not
fear
to
tell
her
all
my
plans
as
my
wife
was
so
timid
i
said
as
little
as
possible
to
her
george
and
i
hurriedly
said
our
farewells
to
our
wives
the
parting
was
heartrending
for
we
knew
the
dangers
were
great
and
the
chances
were
almost
even
that
we
should
not
meet
again
i
could
hardly
leave
my
wife
her
agitation
and
grief
were
so
great
but
we
were
off
in
a
few
moments
we
crept
through
the
orchard
passing
through
farm
after
farm
until
we
struck
the
railroad
about
seven
miles
from
home
we
followed
this
road
until
we
reached
senatobia
about
half
past
seven
in
the
evening
we
felt
good
and
stopping
all
night
we
started
the
next
morning
for
hernando
another
small
town
and
reached
there
at
two
in
the
afternoon
the
most
of
the
bridges
had
been
burned
by
the
troops
and
there
were
no
regular
railroad
trains
fortunately
however
flat
cars
drawn
by
horses
were
run
over
the
road
and
on
a
train
of
this
kind
we
took
passage
on
several
occasions
the
passengers
had
to
get
out
and
push
the
car
over
a
bridge
as
it
was
not
made
so
horses
could
cross
on
it
the
horses
meantime
being
driven
or
led
through
the
stream
and
then
hitched
to
the
car
again
after
we
had
gone
through
this
process
repeatedly
we
at
last
reached
memphis
arriving
about
seven
monday
evening
the
city
was
filled
with
slaves
from
all
over
the
south
who
cheered
and
gave
us
a
welcome
i
could
scarcely
recognize
memphis
things
were
so
changed
we
met
numbers
of
our
fellow
servants
who
had
run
away
before
us
when
the
war
began
tuesday
and
wednesday
we
spent
in
making
inquiries
and
i
visited
our
old
home
at
mcgee
station
but
how
different
it
was
from
what
it
had
been
when
the
mcgees
were
there
all
was
changed
thursday
we
went
to
see
walker
a
union
officer
who
looked
after
the
colored
folks
and
saw
that
they
had
their
rights
when
we
reached
his
office
we
found
it
so
filled
with
people
waiting
to
see
him
that
we
were
delayed
about
two
hours
before
we
had
an
opportunity
of
speaking
with
him
when
our
turn
came
we
went
in
and
told
him
that
we
were
citizens
of
memphis
until
the
fall
of
fort
pillow
and
donelson
when
our
master
had
run
us
off
with
a
hundred
other
slaves
into
mississippi
and
thence
to
the
salt
works
in
alabama
he
questioned
us
as
to
where
we
lived
in
memphis
i
answered
what
is
now
headquarters
of
the
union
forces
was
the
home
of
master
edmund
mcgee
who
is
now
dead
after
a
few
minutes
i
said
colonel
we
want
protection
to
go
back
to
mississippi
after
our
wives
who
are
still
held
as
slaves
he
replied
you
are
both
free
men
to
go
and
come
as
you
please
why
said
i
colonel
if
we
go
back
to
mississippi
they
will
shoot
the
gizzards
out
of
us
well
said
he
i
can
not
grant
your
request
i
would
be
overrun
with
similar
applications
but
i
will
tell
you
what
you
can
do
there
are
hundreds
of
just
such
men
as
you
want
who
would
be
glad
of
such
a
scout
we
thanked
him
and
left
going
back
for
our
wives
after
carefully
considering
the
matter
we
concluded
to
go
back
to
senatobia
and
see
the
captain
of
the
union
troops
there
the
next
day
friday
we
hired
a
two
horse
wagon
and
made
preparations
to
start
on
our
perilous
undertaking
saturday
morning
it
was
our
hope
to
find
some
one
at
senatobia
to
go
with
us
to
panola
and
protect
us
in
the
effort
to
bring
away
our
wives
so
early
in
the
morning
we
set
out
our
first
stop
was
at
big
springs
camping
ground
where
we
made
preparations
for
refreshing
ourselves
and
spending
the
night
just
as
we
had
finished
building
a
fire
for
cooking
and
keeping
off
the
mosquitoes
two
soldiers
came
riding
up
to
the
spring
hello
said
one
which
way
are
you
traveling
we
are
just
from
memphis
said
george
have
you
any
whisky
asked
one
of
them
we
replied
yes
will
you
give
a
fellow
a
horn
we
answered
the
question
by
handing
them
the
bottle
while
they
were
drinking
george
and
i
stepped
aside
and
after
a
few
moments
talk
we
decided
to
put
the
question
to
them
of
going
with
us
to
get
our
wives
i
asked
where
are
you
from
senatobia
replied
one
we
at
once
laid
our
cause
before
them
telling
them
what
walker
had
said
regarding
our
getting
some
one
to
go
with
us
on
our
enterprise
they
listened
attentively
and
when
we
had
finished
one
of
them
asked
how
much
whisky
have
you
george
answered
two
bottles
what
do
you
intend
to
do
when
you
see
the
captain
at
senatobia
lay
our
complaint
before
him
said
i
now
my
friend
said
one
of
the
soldiers
i
am
afraid
if
you
go
to
the
captain
you
will
be
defeated
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
give
my
comrade
and
me
one
of
your
bottles
of
whisky
and
we
will
put
you
on
a
straight
track
the
reason
why
i
say
this
is
that
our
captain
has
been
sweetened
by
the
rebel
farmers
he
is
invited
out
to
tea
by
them
every
evening
i
know
he
will
put
you
off
but
i
will
write
a
note
to
some
comrades
of
mine
who
i
know
will
bring
you
out
safe
we
agreed
at
once
to
this
proposition
and
gave
them
the
whisky
he
wrote
the
note
and
gave
it
to
us
telling
us
to
go
to
the
last
tent
on
the
line
in
the
camp
where
we
would
find
two
boys
to
whom
we
should
give
it
they
are
brave
said
he
and
the
only
two
i
know
of
that
can
help
you
if
they
are
not
there
do
give
the
note
to
any
one
else
but
wait
till
they
come
back
on
tuesday
night
i
feel
satisfied
that
they
will
go
and
help
you
out
with
these
words
they
rode
off
george
and
i
felt
good
over
our
prospects
a
hazardous
trip
the
next
morning
was
sunday
and
we
started
on
reaching
senatobia
about
eleven
we
went
into
the
camp
following
the
directions
given
us
to
go
to
the
last
tent
in
the
line
but
when
we
reached
there
the
soldiers
were
out
we
lingered
around
the
grounds
a
short
time
then
went
back
and
found
them
there
we
gave
them
the
note
and
after
reading
it
they
simply
asked
us
where
we
had
stopped
our
wagon
i
told
them
outside
the
village
go
there
said
one
of
them
and
remain
until
we
come
out
to
see
you
shortly
they
came
out
and
after
we
had
told
them
what
we
wanted
the
distance
to
mcgee
which
was
about
nineteen
miles
from
senatobia
and
had
given
them
such
other
information
as
they
desired
they
concluded
that
they
would
go
we
want
to
be
back
said
i
before
daylight
monday
morning
because
we
must
not
be
seen
on
the
road
for
we
are
well
known
in
that
section
and
if
discovered
would
be
captured
and
killed
well
said
one
of
the
soldiers
we
will
have
to
go
back
to
camp
and
arrange
to
be
excused
from
roll
call
this
evening
before
we
can
make
the
trip
they
went
back
to
camp
and
in
about
ten
minutes
they
came
out
again
saying
all
is
right
we
will
go
we
gave
them
each
ten
dollars
and
promised
if
they
brought
us
out
safely
to
give
each
ten
dollars
more
it
was
now
about
eleven
they
had
to
go
to
camp
and
slip
their
horses
out
cautiously
so
as
not
to
be
seen
by
the
captain
in
half
an
hour
we
were
on
our
way
and
after
we
had
ridden
some
two
miles
we
were
overtaken
by
the
two
soldiers
it
was
sunday
afternoon
and
our
having
a
wagon
attracted
much
attention
from
the
farmers
as
we
passed
along
they
looked
at
us
so
sharply
that
george
and
i
felt
decidedly
uneasy
yet
we
kept
up
courage
and
pressed
steadily
on
after
a
long
and
weary
ride
we
reached
old
master
jack
a
little
after
sundown
the
soldiers
rode
into
the
yard
ahead
of
us
and
the
first
person
they
met
was
a
servant
frank
at
the
woodpile
they
said
to
him
go
in
and
tell
your
master
mcgee
to
come
out
we
want
to
see
him
at
the
same
time
asking
for
louis
and
george
wives
young
william
mcgee
came
out
and
the
soldiers
said
to
him
we
want
feed
for
head
of
horses
mcgee
said
we
have
not
got
it
just
then
george
and
i
were
coming
up
we
drove
in
at
the
gate
through
the
grove
and
passed
the
woodpile
where
mcgee
and
the
soldiers
were
talking
mcgee
had
just
replied
we
have
not
got
that
much
feed
to
spare
we
are
almost
out
well
said
the
soldiers
we
must
have
it
and
they
followed
on
right
after
the
wagons
as
we
drove
past
them
young
mcgee
went
running
into
the
house
saying
to
his
mother
it
is
louis
and
george
and
i
kill
one
of
them
this
raised
quite
an
alarm
and
the
members
of
the
family
told
him
not
to
do
that
as
it
would
ruin
them
as
soon
as
george
and
i
drove
up
to
the
first
cabin
which
was
my
wife
and
kitty
we
ran
in
kitty
met
us
at
the
door
and
said
i
am
all
ready
she
was
looking
for
us
we
commenced
loading
our
wagon
with
our
few
things
meanwhile
the
soldiers
had
ridden
around
a
few
rods
and
came
upon
old
master
jack
and
the
minister
of
the
parish
who
were
watching
as
guards
to
keep
the
slaves
from
running
away
to
the
yankees
just
think
of
the
outrage
upon
those
poor
creatures
in
forcibly
retaining
them
in
slavery
long
after
the
proclamation
making
them
free
had
gone
into
effect
beyond
all
question
as
the
soldiers
rode
up
to
the
two
men
they
said
hello
what
are
you
doing
here
why
have
you
not
told
these
two
men
louis
and
george
that
they
are
free
men
that
they
can
go
and
come
as
they
like
by
this
time
all
the
family
were
aroused
and
great
excitement
prevailed
the
soldier
presence
drew
all
the
servants
near
george
and
i
hurried
to
fill
up
our
wagon
telling
our
wives
to
get
in
as
there
was
no
time
to
lose
we
must
go
at
once
in
twenty
minutes
we
were
all
loaded
my
wife
aunt
kitty
and
nine
other
servants
followed
the
wagon
i
waited
for
a
few
moments
for
mary
ellen
sister
of
my
wife
and
as
she
came
running
out
of
the
white
folks
house
she
said
to
her
mistress
farrington
i
wish
you
good
luck
i
wish
you
all
the
bad
luck
said
she
in
a
rage
but
mary
did
not
stop
to
notice
her
mistress
further
and
joining
me
we
were
soon
on
the
road
following
the
wagon
two
brave
men
those
soldiers
were
brave
indeed
think
of
the
courage
and
daring
involved
in
this
scheme
only
two
soldiers
going
into
a
country
of
which
they
knew
nothing
except
that
every
white
man
living
in
it
was
their
enemy
the
demand
which
they
made
for
food
for
horses
was
a
clever
ruse
invented
by
them
to
alarm
the
mcgees
and
make
them
think
that
there
was
a
troop
of
horses
near
by
and
that
it
would
not
be
safe
for
them
to
offer
any
resistance
to
our
going
away
with
our
wives
had
they
thought
that
there
were
but
two
soldiers
it
is
certain
that
they
would
have
endeavored
to
prevent
us
getting
away
again
and
one
or
more
of
us
would
undoubtedly
have
been
killed
as
already
stated
nine
other
slaves
followed
our
wagon
as
it
moved
off
they
had
no
hats
on
some
were
they
had
not
stopped
to
get
anything
but
as
soon
as
they
saw
a
chance
to
get
away
they
went
just
as
they
were
at
the
moment
aunt
kitty
was
brave
and
forethoughtful
for
during
the
week
we
were
gone
she
had
baked
and
cooked
a
large
amount
of
substantial
food
that
would
keep
us
from
starving
while
on
our
journey
at
the
first
road
crossing
the
two
soldiers
thought
they
saw
a
large
troop
of
soldiers
in
the
distance
and
they
galloped
ahead
of
us
at
full
speed
but
on
arriving
at
the
spot
they
found
that
what
they
had
thought
soldiers
were
only
a
herd
of
cattle
they
rode
on
to
the
next
crossing
we
following
as
we
conveniently
could
each
poor
slave
was
busy
with
his
thoughts
and
his
prayers
now
and
then
one
would
hear
a
moan
or
a
word
from
some
of
the
party
all
were
scared
even
though
the
soldiers
were
with
us
we
came
to
the
next
cross
road
and
passed
that
safely
our
fear
was
that
the
mcgees
might
get
the
neighborhood
to
join
them
and
pursue
us
or
send
the
home
guards
after
us
but
providence
was
seemingly
smiling
upon
us
at
last
for
no
one
followed
or
molested
us
we
moved
on
all
night
until
we
came
to
a
creek
at
four
in
the
morning
of
monday
the
banks
of
the
creek
were
very
steep
and
as
the
horses
and
wagon
went
down
into
the
stream
the
mattress
on
top
of
the
wagon
upon
which
my
wife
and
her
sister
children
were
sitting
was
thrown
off
into
the
water
immediately
the
horses
stopped
and
became
balky
it
was
such
a
warm
night
that
they
did
not
want
to
move
on
out
of
the
water
and
would
not
start
either
until
they
got
ready
as
soon
as
the
soldiers
saw
the
mattress
slide
off
with
my
wife
and
the
children
one
of
them
plunged
into
the
water
with
his
horse
and
in
a
minute
brought
them
all
out
all
had
a
good
ducking
indeed
it
seemed
like
a
baptism
by
immersion
the
drenched
ones
were
wrapped
in
old
blankets
and
after
an
hour
delay
we
were
again
on
our
way
the
soldiers
said
now
we
must
leave
you
the
time
is
coming
when
we
must
be
in
camp
for
roll
call
if
you
are
not
at
our
camp
when
roll
call
is
over
we
will
come
back
and
see
about
you
we
gave
them
each
the
second
ten
dollars
as
agreed
upon
and
just
as
they
rode
to
the
top
of
the
hill
they
left
us
we
had
a
clear
sweep
from
this
point
and
we
came
into
senatobia
about
nine
in
the
forenoon
our
two
soldier
friends
who
had
brought
us
out
so
safely
came
out
of
camp
to
see
us
they
cheered
us
and
seemed
glad
that
they
had
rendered
us
service
we
stopped
at
the
camp
until
we
had
dried
our
clothes
and
had
some
breakfast
and
then
we
made
our
way
to
memphis
out
of
bondage
at
last
my
wife
and
her
sister
were
shoeless
and
the
latter
had
no
hat
on
she
had
hurried
out
of
the
house
in
such
excitement
that
she
thought
of
nothing
but
getting
away
having
to
walk
some
of
the
way
as
all
could
not
ride
in
the
wagon
at
the
same
time
we
were
all
tired
dirty
and
and
on
the
whole
a
pitiful
crowd
to
look
at
as
we
came
into
the
city
one
venerable
old
man
bent
with
age
whose
ebony
face
shone
with
delight
came
running
out
into
the
road
as
we
appeared
exclaiming
oh
here
dey
come
god
bless
poor
they
come
fannin
we
used
large
palm
leaves
to
fan
ourselves
with
as
we
were
so
warm
those
nine
souls
that
followed
us
walked
the
whole
distance
arriving
shortly
after
we
did
thousands
of
others
in
search
of
the
freedom
of
which
they
had
so
long
dreamed
flocked
into
the
city
of
refuge
some
having
walked
hundreds
of
miles
it
was
appropriately
the
of
july
when
we
arrived
and
aside
from
the
citizens
of
memphis
hundreds
of
colored
refugees
thronged
the
streets
everywhere
you
looked
you
could
see
soldiers
such
a
day
i
do
believe
memphis
will
ever
see
again
when
so
large
and
so
motley
a
crowd
will
come
together
our
two
soldier
rescuers
looked
us
up
after
we
were
in
memphis
and
seemed
truly
glad
that
we
had
attained
our
freedom
and
that
they
had
been
instrumental
in
it
only
one
thing
we
regret
and
that
is
that
we
did
not
learn
their
names
but
we
were
in
so
much
trouble
and
so
absorbed
in
the
business
which
we
had
in
hand
so
excited
by
the
perils
of
our
undertaking
that
we
never
thought
to
ask
them
their
names
or
to
what
regiment
they
belonged
then
after
we
got
to
memphis
though
we
were
most
grateful
for
the
service
which
they
had
rendered
us
we
were
still
so
excited
by
our
new
condition
and
surroundings
that
we
thought
of
little
else
and
forgot
that
we
had
no
means
of
establishing
at
a
later
time
the
identity
of
those
to
whom
we
owed
so
much
freedom
that
we
had
so
long
looked
for
had
come
at
last
and
we
gave
praise
to
god
blessing
the
day
when
we
met
those
two
heroes
it
is
true
that
we
should
have
been
free
sooner
or
later
still
but
for
their
assistance
my
wife
and
i
might
never
have
met
again
if
i
could
not
have
gone
back
which
i
could
never
have
done
alone
until
long
after
such
changes
might
have
occurred
as
would
have
separated
us
for
years
if
not
forever
thousands
were
separated
in
this
manner
men
escaping
to
the
union
lines
hoping
to
make
a
way
to
return
for
their
families
but
failing
in
this
and
not
daring
to
return
alone
never
saw
their
wives
or
children
more
thanks
to
god
we
were
guided
to
these
brave
soldiers
and
so
escaped
from
so
cruel
a
fate
a
word
for
my
old
master
in
closing
this
account
of
my
years
of
bondage
it
is
perhaps
but
justice
to
say
of
my
old
master
that
he
was
in
some
respects
kinder
and
more
humane
than
many
other
slaveholders
he
fed
well
and
all
had
enough
to
wear
such
as
it
was
it
is
true
that
the
material
was
coarse
but
it
was
suited
to
the
season
and
therefore
comfortable
which
could
not
truthfully
be
said
of
the
clothing
of
the
slaves
of
other
planters
not
a
few
of
these
did
not
have
sufficient
clothes
to
keep
them
warm
in
winter
nor
did
they
have
sufficient
nourishing
and
wholesome
food
but
while
my
master
showed
these
virtues
similar
to
those
which
a
provident
farmer
would
show
in
the
care
of
his
dumb
brutes
he
lacked
in
that
humane
feeling
which
should
have
kept
him
from
buying
and
selling
human
beings
and
parting
kindred
which
should
have
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
have
permitted
the
lashing
beating
and
lacerating
of
his
slaves
much
more
the
hiring
of
an
irresponsible
brute
by
the
year
to
perform
this
barbarous
service
for
him
the
mcgees
were
charitable
as
they
interpreted
the
word
were
always
ready
to
contribute
to
educational
and
missionary
funds
while
denying
under
the
severest
penalties
all
education
to
those
most
needing
it
and
all
true
missionary
effort
the
spiritual
enlightenment
for
which
they
were
famishing
then
our
masters
lacked
that
fervent
charity
the
love
of
christ
in
the
heart
which
if
they
had
possessed
they
could
not
have
treated
us
as
they
did
they
would
have
remembered
the
golden
rule
do
unto
others
as
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
possessing
absolute
power
over
the
bodies
and
souls
of
their
slaves
and
grown
rich
from
their
unrequited
toil
they
became
possessed
by
the
demon
of
avarice
and
pride
and
lost
sight
of
the
most
vital
of
the
christly
qualities
chapter
freedom
after
slavery
coming
north
as
before
stated
we
arrived
in
memphis
on
the
fourth
of
july
my
first
effort
as
a
freeman
was
to
get
something
to
do
to
sustain
myself
and
wife
and
a
babe
of
a
few
months
that
was
born
at
the
salt
works
i
succeeded
in
getting
a
room
for
us
and
went
to
work
the
second
day
driving
a
public
carriage
i
made
enough
to
keep
us
and
pay
our
room
rent
by
our
economy
we
managed
to
get
on
very
well
i
worked
on
hoping
to
go
further
north
feeling
somehow
that
it
would
be
better
for
us
there
when
one
day
i
ran
across
a
man
who
knew
my
wife
mother
he
said
to
me
why
your
wife
mother
went
back
up
the
river
to
cincinnati
i
knew
her
well
and
the
people
to
whom
she
belonged
this
information
made
us
eager
to
take
steps
to
find
her
my
wife
was
naturally
anxious
to
follow
the
clue
thus
obtained
in
hopes
of
finding
her
mother
whom
she
had
not
seen
since
the
separation
at
memphis
years
before
we
therefore
concluded
to
go
as
far
as
cincinnati
at
any
rate
and
endeavor
to
get
some
further
information
of
mother
my
wife
seemed
to
gather
new
strength
in
learning
this
news
of
her
mother
meager
though
it
was
after
a
stay
in
memphis
of
six
weeks
we
went
on
to
cincinnati
hopeful
of
meeting
some
at
least
of
the
family
that
though
free
in
defiance
of
justice
had
been
consigned
to
cruel
and
hopeless
bondage
bondage
in
violation
of
civil
as
well
as
moral
law
we
felt
it
was
almost
impossible
that
we
should
see
any
one
that
we
ever
knew
but
the
man
had
spoken
so
earnestly
and
positively
regarding
my
that
we
were
not
without
hope
on
arriving
at
cincinnati
our
first
inquiry
was
about
her
my
wife
giving
her
name
and
description
and
fortunately
we
came
upon
a
colored
man
who
said
he
knew
of
a
woman
answering
to
the
name
and
description
which
my
wife
gave
of
her
mother
and
he
directed
us
to
the
house
where
she
was
stopping
when
we
reached
the
place
to
which
we
had
been
directed
my
wife
not
only
found
her
mother
but
one
of
her
sisters
the
meeting
was
a
joyful
one
to
us
all
no
mortal
who
has
not
experienced
it
can
imagine
the
feeling
of
those
who
meet
again
after
long
years
of
enforced
separation
and
hardship
and
utter
ignorance
of
one
another
condition
and
place
of
habitation
i
questioned
them
as
to
when
and
where
they
had
met
and
how
it
happened
that
they
were
now
together
my
then
began
the
following
narrative
when
i
was
sold
from
the
memphis
trader
yard
i
was
bought
by
a
man
who
lived
not
far
from
memphis
i
never
heard
of
any
of
the
children
and
knew
nothing
as
to
what
had
become
of
them
after
the
capture
of
memphis
by
the
union
army
the
people
to
whom
i
belonged
fled
from
their
home
leaving
their
slaves
and
the
other
slaveholders
of
the
neighborhood
did
the
same
the
slaves
left
to
themselves
at
once
departed
for
memphis
and
i
among
the
number
when
i
had
been
there
but
a
short
time
a
call
was
made
for
nurses
to
go
into
the
hospital
and
after
thinking
of
it
for
a
few
minutes
i
concluded
to
answer
the
call
and
was
speedily
installed
in
the
work
when
i
had
been
there
a
short
time
i
found
to
my
great
surprise
and
delight
my
eldest
daughter
was
also
employed
there
she
had
come
to
memphis
as
i
had
because
her
master
family
had
fled
and
hearing
the
call
for
nurses
had
entered
the
service
at
once
i
can
not
tell
my
pleasure
in
meeting
one
of
my
children
for
i
had
never
expected
to
see
any
of
them
again
we
continued
our
work
in
the
hospital
until
generals
sheridan
and
grant
said
the
city
was
getting
too
crowded
with
colored
people
there
was
not
room
for
them
some
must
be
removed
so
large
numbers
of
them
were
sent
to
cincinnati
and
my
daughter
and
i
were
among
them
this
is
why
you
see
us
here
together
when
she
had
finished
telling
this
story
my
wife
and
i
were
shedding
tears
of
joy
my
mary
ellen
whom
boss
bought
at
the
same
time
that
he
bought
my
wife
was
with
us
thus
the
mother
and
three
daughters
had
met
again
most
unexpectedly
and
in
a
way
almost
miraculous
this
meeting
again
of
mother
and
daughters
after
years
of
separation
and
many
vicissitudes
was
an
occasion
of
the
profoundest
joy
although
all
were
almost
wholly
destitute
of
the
necessaries
of
life
this
first
evening
we
spent
together
can
never
be
forgotten
i
can
see
the
old
woman
now
with
bowed
form
and
gray
locks
as
she
gave
thanks
in
joyful
tones
yet
reverent
manner
for
such
a
wonderful
blessing
in
canada
we
did
not
remain
long
in
cincinnati
as
houses
were
so
scarce
we
could
not
get
a
place
to
stop
in
my
wife
mother
had
but
one
room
and
we
could
not
stay
there
we
went
on
to
hamilton
but
stayed
there
only
two
months
i
worked
at
whatever
i
could
get
to
do
whitewashing
and
odd
jobs
of
any
kind
the
women
managed
to
get
washing
to
do
so
that
we
got
on
very
well
our
aim
was
when
we
left
memphis
to
get
to
canada
as
we
regarded
that
as
the
safest
place
for
refugees
from
slavery
we
did
not
know
what
might
come
again
for
our
injury
so
now
as
we
had
found
some
of
my
wife
people
we
were
more
eager
to
go
and
as
i
could
not
get
any
steady
work
in
hamilton
we
made
ready
to
move
on
we
went
straight
to
detroit
and
crossed
over
the
river
to
windsor
canada
arriving
there
on
christmas
i
succeeded
in
getting
work
as
a
porter
at
the
iron
house
a
hotel
situated
near
the
landing
here
my
wife
also
was
employed
and
here
we
remained
until
spring
when
as
the
wages
were
so
small
in
windsor
i
went
over
to
detroit
to
seek
for
more
profitable
employment
after
some
effort
i
succeeded
in
securing
a
situation
as
waiter
in
the
biddle
house
and
remained
there
two
years
when
the
manager
died
and
it
changed
hands
and
much
as
i
disliked
to
make
a
change
in
my
work
i
found
it
necessary
an
opportunity
soon
offered
of
a
position
as
sailor
on
the
steamer
saginaw
which
ran
from
green
bay
to
escanaba
in
connection
with
the
railroad
a
clew
to
my
brother
william
while
i
was
on
this
boat
one
of
the
men
who
worked
with
me
said
to
me
one
day
have
you
a
brother
hughes
i
said
yes
but
i
do
know
anything
about
him
we
were
sold
from
each
other
when
boys
well
said
he
i
used
to
sail
with
a
man
whose
name
was
billy
hughes
and
he
looked
just
like
you
i
told
him
there
were
three
boys
of
us
that
we
were
sold
to
different
parties
and
that
i
had
never
seen
either
of
my
brothers
since
one
brother
was
named
william
but
went
by
the
nickname
of
billy
has
this
man
had
his
forefinger
cut
off
asked
i
oh
replied
he
i
do
know
hughes
about
that
well
said
i
this
is
all
i
remember
about
billy
i
accidentally
chopped
off
his
forefinger
one
day
when
we
were
small
boys
in
virginia
this
is
the
only
thing
by
which
i
could
identify
my
brother
william
nothing
more
was
said
upon
the
matter
and
it
dropped
out
of
my
mind
i
did
not
realize
how
important
were
the
words
of
this
man
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
he
held
the
clew
that
might
bring
us
together
again
work
in
chicago
when
the
sailing
season
had
ended
the
steamer
tied
up
at
chicago
for
the
winter
upon
going
ashore
i
at
once
tried
to
get
something
else
to
do
for
i
could
not
afford
to
be
idle
a
day
one
of
the
first
men
i
met
in
chicago
was
my
old
friend
and
thomas
bland
he
was
glad
to
see
me
and
told
me
all
about
his
escape
to
canada
and
how
he
had
met
will
mcgee
at
niagara
falls
he
was
working
at
the
sherman
house
having
charge
of
the
coat
room
i
told
him
that
i
had
been
sailing
during
the
summer
but
that
the
boat
was
now
laid
up
and
that
i
was
anxious
for
another
job
he
said
he
would
try
and
see
what
he
could
do
for
me
he
went
to
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
rice
and
to
my
surprise
and
delight
he
was
so
fortunate
as
to
secure
me
a
position
as
porter
and
general
utility
man
my
family
were
still
at
windsor
canada
and
when
i
had
secured
this
place
i
got
leave
of
absence
to
make
them
a
visit
and
went
there
at
once
two
babies
had
been
born
only
a
day
before
my
arrival
i
had
hoped
to
be
there
on
the
interesting
occasion
but
was
too
late
however
i
was
pleased
to
find
two
bright
little
girls
to
aid
in
the
family
greeting
which
was
delightful
after
the
months
of
separation
my
wife
her
sister
mary
and
her
two
children
her
mother
and
the
sister
we
found
at
cincinnati
were
all
still
here
living
together
attending
night
school
after
a
visit
of
two
weeks
with
my
family
i
returned
to
chicago
and
began
my
work
at
the
sherman
house
i
was
full
of
energy
and
hope
and
resolved
to
put
forth
every
effort
to
make
a
man
of
myself
and
to
earn
an
honest
living
i
saw
that
i
needed
education
and
it
was
one
of
the
bitterest
remembrances
of
my
servitude
that
i
had
been
cheated
out
of
this
inalienable
right
this
immeasurable
blessing
i
therefore
determined
to
do
what
was
in
my
power
to
gain
something
of
that
of
which
i
had
been
cruelly
defrauded
hence
i
entered
the
for
freedmen
which
had
been
established
in
the
city
and
faithfully
attended
its
sessions
during
the
months
it
was
kept
open
i
settle
in
milwaukee
i
worked
at
the
sherman
house
until
august
and
during
this
time
saw
many
travelers
and
business
men
and
made
some
lasting
friends
among
them
among
these
was
plankinton
he
seemed
to
take
a
fancy
to
me
and
offered
me
a
situation
in
the
plankinton
house
soon
to
be
opened
in
milwaukee
i
readily
accepted
it
for
i
was
not
getting
a
large
salary
and
the
position
which
he
offered
promised
more
the
plankinton
house
was
opened
in
september
and
i
was
placed
in
full
charge
of
the
coat
room
and
after
i
had
been
there
some
time
i
had
in
connection
with
my
coat
room
duties
charge
of
the
bell
stand
my
wife
had
charge
of
the
waiter
rooms
a
lodging
house
situated
on
second
street
one
door
from
grand
avenue
this
was
a
brick
building
that
stood
where
the
west
portion
of
the
plankinton
now
stands
the
second
floor
was
used
as
our
living
rooms
the
third
and
fourth
floors
constituted
the
sleeping
apartments
of
the
hotel
waiters
my
wife
looked
after
these
apartments
saw
that
they
were
clean
and
had
a
general
supervision
of
them
begin
business
for
myself
in
a
small
way
after
the
hotel
had
been
running
a
little
over
a
year
i
saw
there
was
a
chance
for
me
to
make
something
at
laundry
work
i
was
allowed
to
take
washing
from
any
of
the
guests
who
desired
their
work
done
privately
in
this
way
i
worked
up
quite
a
business
i
still
continued
my
coat
room
duties
as
my
wife
managed
the
laundry
work
our
laundry
business
increased
so
rapidly
i
deemed
it
best
to
change
our
quarters
from
second
street
to
grand
avenue
which
seemed
better
suited
for
our
purpose
here
the
business
continued
to
grow
until
it
reached
proportions
of
which
we
had
little
idea
when
we
began
it
meeting
relatives
of
my
old
master
one
day
while
i
was
at
the
plankinton
i
happened
to
be
coming
through
the
hall
when
whom
should
i
meet
but
col
hunting
of
old
master
jack
mcgee
of
mississippi
we
came
face
to
face
and
i
knew
him
at
once
but
he
only
partially
recognized
me
he
said
i
know
your
face
but
can
not
recall
your
name
i
said
do
you
know
louis
mcgee
he
then
remembered
me
at
once
why
said
he
my
wife
my
brother
and
all
his
family
are
here
there
is
a
party
of
us
on
a
pleasure
trip
through
the
north
i
soon
learned
that
they
had
visited
at
waukesha
springs
and
had
been
at
the
hotel
only
a
few
hours
waiting
for
the
boat
for
grand
haven
i
hastened
to
bring
my
wife
to
see
them
and
got
back
with
her
just
in
time
they
were
already
in
the
but
waited
for
us
we
very
cordially
shook
hands
with
them
they
asked
me
why
i
had
come
so
far
north
and
i
replied
that
we
kept
traveling
until
we
found
a
place
where
we
could
make
a
good
living
they
wished
us
success
and
the
rolled
away
finding
my
brother
william
while
i
was
at
the
plankinton
house
many
of
the
traveling
men
seemingly
liked
to
talk
with
me
when
they
came
to
the
coat
room
to
check
their
things
i
remember
one
day
when
conversing
with
one
of
these
gentlemen
he
asked
all
of
a
sudden
say
hughes
have
you
a
brother
i
answered
yes
i
had
two
but
i
think
they
are
dead
i
was
sold
from
them
when
a
mere
lad
well
said
he
if
you
have
a
brother
he
is
in
cleveland
there
is
a
fellow
there
who
is
chief
cook
at
the
forest
city
hotel
who
looks
just
like
you
i
grew
eager
at
these
words
and
put
the
same
question
to
him
that
i
did
to
the
man
on
the
steamer
when
i
was
sailing
has
he
one
cut
off
he
laughed
and
answered
well
i
do
know
hughes
about
that
but
i
do
know
this
his
name
is
billy
and
he
resembles
you
very
much
i
tell
you
what
i
do
when
i
go
back
to
cleveland
on
my
next
trip
i
look
and
see
if
that
is
off
now
that
the
second
person
had
called
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
man
in
cleveland
who
looked
very
much
like
me
i
became
deeply
interested
in
fact
i
was
so
excited
i
could
hardly
do
my
work
i
awaited
the
agents
return
with
what
of
patience
i
could
command
and
at
last
one
day
when
i
was
least
expecting
him
i
was
greeted
with
these
words
hello
hughes
i
have
good
news
for
you
i
grew
so
excited
i
could
hardly
stand
still
well
he
said
you
told
me
that
you
had
a
brother
whose
name
was
william
but
called
billy
for
short
yes
i
said
did
your
brother
billy
have
his
chopped
off
by
his
brother
louis
when
as
boys
they
were
one
day
playing
together
yes
i
replied
then
i
have
found
your
brother
he
said
i
have
seen
the
man
in
cleveland
and
he
corroborates
your
story
in
every
particular
he
says
that
he
was
born
in
virginia
near
charlottesville
and
was
owned
by
one
john
martin
i
knew
now
beyond
question
that
this
was
my
brother
william
words
failed
me
to
express
my
feelings
at
this
news
the
prospect
of
seeing
my
brother
lost
so
many
years
before
made
me
almost
wild
with
joy
i
thanked
the
agent
for
the
interest
he
had
taken
in
me
and
for
the
invaluable
and
comprehensive
information
he
had
brought
he
could
hardly
have
done
me
a
greater
favor
or
bound
me
to
him
by
a
more
lasting
obligation
my
first
step
was
to
arrange
for
a
leave
of
absence
from
my
work
which
i
found
no
difficulty
in
accomplishing
and
by
night
i
was
aboard
the
express
going
to
cleveland
my
excitement
did
not
diminish
as
i
sped
on
my
journey
and
the
speed
of
the
express
was
too
slow
for
my
eager
anticipations
upon
reaching
cleveland
i
went
directly
to
the
hotel
where
i
was
told
my
brother
was
employed
and
inquired
at
the
office
for
billy
hughes
a
bell
boy
was
summoned
to
take
me
around
to
the
department
where
he
was
when
we
met
neither
of
us
spoke
for
some
moments
speech
is
not
for
such
occasions
but
silence
rather
and
the
rush
of
thoughts
when
the
first
flash
of
feeling
had
passed
i
spoke
calling
him
by
name
and
he
addressed
me
as
brother
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
on
either
side
as
to
our
true
relationship
though
the
features
of
each
had
long
since
faded
forever
from
the
memory
of
the
other
he
took
me
to
his
house
and
each
of
us
related
his
story
with
such
feelings
as
few
can
fully
appreciate
he
told
me
that
he
had
never
heard
anything
of
our
mother
or
brother
he
went
back
to
the
old
home
in
virginia
after
the
close
of
the
rebellion
but
could
get
no
trace
of
her
as
we
related
our
varied
experiences
the
hardships
the
wrongs
and
sorrows
which
we
endured
and
at
last
the
coming
of
brighter
days
we
were
sad
then
happy
it
seemed
and
indeed
was
wonderful
that
we
should
have
met
again
after
so
long
a
separation
the
time
allotted
to
my
visit
with
him
passed
most
pleasantly
and
all
too
quickly
and
as
i
looked
into
the
faces
of
his
wife
and
children
i
seemed
to
have
entered
a
new
and
broader
life
and
one
in
which
the
joys
of
social
intercourse
had
marvelously
expanded
when
i
came
to
saying
to
him
so
close
did
i
feel
to
him
the
tie
between
us
seemed
never
to
have
been
broken
that
week
so
full
of
new
experiences
and
emotions
can
never
be
erased
from
my
memory
after
many
promises
of
the
maintenance
of
the
social
relations
thus
renewed
we
parted
to
take
up
again
the
burdens
of
life
but
with
new
inspiration
and
deeper
feeling
i
came
back
to
my
work
with
renewed
vigor
and
i
could
not
but
rejoice
and
give
praise
to
god
for
the
blessings
that
i
had
experienced
in
the
years
since
my
bondage
and
especially
for
this
partial
restoration
of
the
broken
tie
of
kindred
i
had
long
since
learned
to
love
christ
and
my
faith
in
him
was
so
firmly
established
that
i
gave
him
praise
for
each
and
every
ray
of
happiness
that
came
into
my
life
growth
of
the
laundry
business
i
continued
the
laundry
work
in
connection
with
that
at
the
hotel
until
i
had
been
in
the
plankinton
house
then
six
years
and
a
half
the
laundry
business
had
increased
to
such
an
extent
that
my
wife
could
not
manage
it
all
alone
i
therefore
gave
up
my
position
at
the
hotel
and
went
into
the
laundry
work
on
a
somewhat
larger
scale
than
that
upon
which
we
had
been
conducting
it
we
were
still
doing
business
at
grand
avenue
and
there
we
remained
until
when
we
removed
to
more
commodious
quarters
at
on
the
avenue
but
we
remained
there
only
a
few
mouths
when
we
removed
to
fourth
street
in
the
rear
the
establishment
here
was
fitted
up
with
all
modern
appliances
but
i
was
not
so
successful
as
i
anticipated
my
losses
were
heavy
and
though
the
facilities
for
doing
the
work
were
much
better
than
those
which
we
had
before
possessed
the
location
was
not
so
accessible
or
inviting
we
therefore
went
back
to
our
former
location
at
on
the
avenue
employed
as
a
nurse
not
long
after
this
douglas
a
prominent
physician
of
the
city
at
that
time
was
in
failing
health
and
wishing
a
nurse
i
was
recommended
to
him
for
this
service
by
a
friend
i
served
the
doctor
in
this
capacity
every
night
for
three
months
i
then
went
with
him
to
mccomb
a
village
in
southern
mississippi
which
had
been
in
the
days
of
slavery
a
somewhat
famous
resort
but
which
had
lost
its
prestige
and
entered
upon
a
general
decline
the
hotel
and
all
its
surroundings
presenting
the
appearance
of
general
dilapidation
i
remained
here
with
the
doctor
for
two
weeks
until
they
succeeded
in
getting
another
person
to
care
for
him
i
then
took
a
run
down
to
new
orleans
a
trip
south
on
this
southern
trip
i
had
the
opportunity
of
observing
the
condition
of
the
country
through
which
we
passed
many
of
the
farms
seemed
neglected
the
houses
dilapidated
or
abandoned
the
fields
either
uncultivated
and
overgrown
with
bushes
or
the
crops
struggling
with
grass
and
weeds
for
the
mastery
and
presenting
but
little
promise
of
a
paying
harvest
in
some
places
the
bushes
and
other
undergrowth
were
fifteen
feet
high
and
the
landscape
was
peculiar
and
by
no
means
inviting
i
could
remember
the
appearance
of
the
cotton
farms
in
slavery
days
but
how
changed
were
things
i
now
saw
they
did
not
look
at
all
like
those
which
i
had
been
accustomed
to
see
everything
was
dismal
and
uninviting
the
entire
country
passed
through
in
mississippi
looked
like
a
wilderness
this
deterioration
was
the
natural
result
of
the
devastating
war
which
had
swept
the
country
and
to
the
industrial
revolution
which
followed
and
to
which
affairs
had
not
been
adjusted
when
i
arrived
at
new
orleans
i
found
the
levee
filled
with
fruit
oranges
and
bananas
were
piled
in
masses
like
coal
and
the
scenes
in
this
portion
of
the
city
were
very
different
from
anything
one
sees
in
the
north
among
the
many
places
of
interest
in
the
city
were
the
cemeteries
owing
to
the
low
level
of
the
ground
and
its
saturation
with
water
burials
are
seldom
made
in
graves
but
instead
in
tombs
built
of
brick
or
marble
or
other
stone
in
which
are
constructed
cells
running
back
from
the
front
and
of
a
size
and
shape
sufficient
to
admit
a
coffin
then
as
soon
as
filled
they
are
sealed
up
these
tombs
contain
from
two
to
six
or
eight
or
even
more
of
these
cells
and
their
general
appearance
from
the
front
is
not
unlike
that
of
a
section
of
mail
boxes
in
a
postoffice
other
places
of
interest
were
the
old
french
market
the
public
squares
and
gardens
the
old
catholic
churches
and
some
of
the
relics
of
slavery
days
in
the
shape
of
pens
where
slaves
were
exposed
for
sale
one
of
these
was
in
the
basement
of
the
hotel
royal
which
would
contain
several
hundred
at
once
and
from
which
hundreds
went
to
a
bondage
bitterer
than
death
and
from
which
death
was
the
only
relief
i
make
nursing
my
regular
business
i
came
back
to
milwaukee
with
a
new
idea
i
liked
nursing
it
was
my
choice
from
childhood
even
though
i
had
been
deprived
of
a
course
of
training
i
felt
that
i
was
not
too
old
to
try
at
least
to
learn
the
art
or
to
add
to
what
i
already
knew
douglas
gave
me
a
splendid
recommendation
and
had
some
cards
printed
bearing
my
name
and
address
these
i
distributed
and
thus
began
the
business
which
i
have
followed
steadily
since
that
time
marks
very
kindly
recommended
me
to
well
known
men
needing
the
service
of
a
nurse
and
to
his
professional
associates
and
through
this
means
and
through
his
continued
kindness
and
interest
i
have
been
almost
constantly
engaged
in
this
work
i
am
also
indebted
to
drs
fox
and
spearman
and
other
prominent
physicians
for
recommendations
which
have
resulted
in
securing
me
employment
which
has
proved
remunerative
to
me
and
which
seemed
to
give
entire
satisfaction
to
the
sick
and
their
friends
this
is
no
small
part
of
the
compensation
in
the
difficult
often
wearing
and
always
delicate
duties
of
the
nurse
in
the
sick
room
to
every
true
man
or
woman
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
satisfactions
to
have
the
consciousness
of
having
been
useful
to
his
fellow
beings
my
duties
as
nurse
have
taken
me
to
different
parts
of
the
state
to
chicago
to
california
and
to
florida
and
i
have
thus
gained
no
little
experience
not
only
in
my
business
but
in
many
other
directions
i
have
endeavored
in
the
foregoing
sketch
to
give
a
clear
and
correct
idea
of
the
institution
of
human
slavery
as
i
witnessed
and
experienced
it
its
brutality
its
degrading
influence
upon
both
master
and
slave
and
its
utter
incompatibility
with
industrial
improvement
and
general
educational
progress
nothing
has
been
exaggerated
or
set
down
in
malice
although
in
the
scars
which
i
still
bear
upon
my
person
and
in
the
wounds
of
spirit
which
will
never
wholly
heal
there
might
be
found
a
seeming
excuse
for
such
a
course
whatever
of
kindness
was
shown
me
during
the
years
of
my
bondage
i
still
gratefully
remember
whether
it
came
from
white
master
or
fellow
slave
and
for
the
recognition
which
has
been
so
generously
accorded
me
since
the
badge
of
servitude
was
removed
i
am
profoundly
and
devoutly
thankful
