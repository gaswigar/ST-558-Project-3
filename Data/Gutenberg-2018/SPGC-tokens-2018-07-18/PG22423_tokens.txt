and
you

when

and

after

the
green

the
it
was
upon
tall
nettles
haymaking
how
at
once
gone
gone
again
the
sun
used
to
shine

small

sheiling

gallows
birds
nests
rain
home
there
nothing
like
the
sun
when
he
should
laugh
an
old
song
the
penny
whistle
lights
out
words
the
trumpet
rise
up
rise
up
and
as
the
trumpet
blowing
chases
the
dreams
of
men
as
the
dawn
glowing
the
stars
that
left
unlit
the
land
and
water
rise
up
and
scatter
the
dew
that
covers
the
print
of
last
night
lovers
scatter
it
scatter
it
while
you
are
listening
to
the
clear
horn
forget
men
everything
on
this
earth
newborn
except
that
it
is
lovelier
than
any
mysteries
open
your
eyes
to
the
air
that
has
washed
the
eyes
of
the
stars
through
all
the
dewy
night
up
with
the
light
to
the
old
wars
arise
arise
the
the
dim
sea
glints
chill
the
white
sun
is
shy
and
the
skeleton
weeds
and
the
rough
long
grasses
keep
white
with
frost
at
the
hilltop
by
the
the
smoke
of
the
is
puffed
over
hawthorn
berry
and
hazel
tuft
i
read
the
sign
which
way
shall
i
go
a
voice
says
you
would
not
have
doubted
so
at
twenty
another
voice
gentle
with
scorn
says
at
twenty
you
wished
you
had
never
been
born
one
hazel
lost
a
leaf
of
gold
from
a
tuft
at
the
tip
when
the
first
voice
told
the
other
he
wished
to
know
what
be
to
be
sixty
by
this
same
post
you
shall
see
he
laughed
and
i
had
to
join
his
laughter
you
shall
see
but
either
before
or
after
whatever
happens
it
must
befall
a
mouthful
of
earth
to
remedy
all
regrets
and
wishes
shall
freely
be
given
and
if
there
be
a
flaw
in
that
heaven
be
freedom
to
wish
and
your
wish
may
be
to
be
here
or
anywhere
talking
to
me
no
matter
what
the
weather
on
earth
at
any
age
between
death
and
birth
to
see
what
day
or
night
can
be
the
sun
and
the
frost
the
land
and
the
sea
summer
autumn
winter
spring
with
a
poor
man
of
any
sort
down
to
a
king
standing
upright
out
in
the
air
wondering
where
he
shall
journey
o
where
tears
it
seems
i
have
no
tears
left
they
should
have
fallen
their
ghosts
if
tears
have
ghosts
did
fall
that
day
when
twenty
hounds
streamed
by
me
not
yet
combed
out
but
still
all
equals
in
their
rage
of
gladness
upon
the
scent
made
one
like
a
great
dragon
in
blooming
meadow
that
bends
towards
the
sun
and
once
bore
hops
and
on
that
other
day
when
i
stepped
out
from
the
tower
into
an
april
morning
stirring
and
sweet
and
warm
strange
solitude
was
there
and
silence
a
mightier
charm
than
any
in
the
tower
possessed
the
courtyard
they
were
changing
guard
soldiers
in
line
young
english
countrymen
and
ruddy
in
white
tunics
drums
and
fifes
were
playing
the
british
grenadiers
the
men
the
music
piercing
that
solitude
and
silence
told
me
truths
i
had
not
dreamed
and
have
forgotten
since
their
beauty
passed
two
pewits
under
the
sky
two
pewits
sport
and
cry
more
white
than
is
the
moon
on
high
riding
the
dark
surge
silently
more
black
than
earth
their
cry
is
the
one
sound
under
the
sky
they
alone
move
now
low
now
high
and
merrily
they
cry
to
the
mischievous
spring
sky
plunging
earthward
tossing
high
over
the
ghost
who
wonders
why
so
merrily
they
cry
and
fly
nor
choose
earth
and
sky
while
the
moon
quarter
silently
rides
and
earth
rests
as
silently
the
manor
farm
the
mud
unfroze
a
little
and
rills
ran
and
sparkled
down
each
side
of
the
road
under
the
catkins
wagging
in
the
hedge
but
earth
would
have
her
sleep
out
spite
of
the
sun
nor
did
i
value
that
thin
gilding
beam
more
than
a
pretty
february
thing
till
i
came
down
to
the
old
manor
farm
and
church
and
opposite
in
age
its
equals
and
in
size
the
church
and
yew
and
farmhouse
slept
in
a
sunday
silentness
the
air
raised
not
a
straw
the
steep
farm
roof
with
tiles
duskily
glowing
entertained
the
sun
and
up
and
down
the
roof
white
pigeons
nestled
there
was
no
sound
but
one
three
were
looking
over
a
gate
drowsily
through
their
forelocks
swishing
their
tails
against
a
fly
a
solitary
fly
the
winter
cheek
flushed
as
if
he
had
drained
spring
summer
and
autumn
at
a
draught
and
smiled
quietly
but
was
not
winter
rather
a
season
of
bliss
unchangeable
awakened
from
farm
and
church
where
it
had
lain
safe
under
tile
and
thatch
for
ages
since
this
england
old
already
was
called
merry
the
owl
downhill
i
came
hungry
and
yet
not
starved
cold
yet
had
heat
within
me
that
was
proof
against
the
north
wind
tired
yet
so
that
rest
had
seemed
the
sweetest
thing
under
a
roof
then
at
the
inn
i
had
food
fire
and
rest
knowing
how
hungry
cold
and
tired
was
i
all
of
the
night
was
quite
barred
out
except
an
owl
cry
a
most
melancholy
cry
shaken
out
long
and
clear
upon
the
hill
no
merry
note
nor
cause
of
merriment
but
one
telling
me
plain
what
i
escaped
and
others
could
not
that
night
as
in
i
went
and
salted
was
my
food
and
my
repose
salted
and
sobered
too
by
the
bird
voice
speaking
for
all
who
lay
under
the
stars
soldiers
and
poor
unable
to
rejoice
swedes
they
have
taken
the
gable
from
the
roof
of
clay
on
the
long
swede
pile
they
have
let
in
the
sun
to
the
white
and
gold
and
purple
of
curled
fronds
unsunned
it
is
a
sight
more
at
the
where
winter
moans
and
drips
than
when
in
the
valley
of
the
tombs
of
kings
a
boy
crawls
down
into
a
pharaoh
tomb
and
first
of
christian
men
beholds
the
mummy
god
and
monkey
chariot
and
throne
and
vase
blue
pottery
alabaster
and
gold
but
dreamless
lies
this
is
a
dream
of
winter
sweet
as
spring
will
you
come
will
you
come
will
you
come
will
you
ride
so
late
at
my
side
o
will
you
come
will
you
come
will
you
come
if
the
night
has
a
moon
full
and
bright
o
will
you
come
would
you
come
would
you
come
if
the
noon
gave
light
not
the
moon
beautiful
would
you
come
would
you
have
come
would
you
have
come
without
scorning
had
it
been
still
morning
beloved
would
you
have
come
if
you
come
haste
and
come
owls
have
cried
it
grows
dark
to
ride
beloved
beautiful
come
as
the
team
as
the
team
flashed
out
on
the
turn
the
lovers
disappeared
into
the
wood
i
sat
among
the
boughs
of
the
fallen
elm
that
strewed
an
angle
of
the
fallow
and
watched
the
plough
narrowing
a
yellow
square
of
charlock
every
time
the
horses
turned
instead
of
treading
me
down
the
ploughman
leaned
upon
the
handles
to
say
or
ask
a
word
about
the
weather
next
about
the
war
scraping
the
share
he
faced
towards
the
wood
and
screwed
along
the
furrow
till
the
brass
flashed
once
more
the
blizzard
felled
the
elm
whose
crest
i
sat
in
by
a
woodpecker
round
hole
the
ploughman
said
when
will
they
take
it
away
when
the
war
over
so
the
talk
began
one
minute
and
an
interval
of
ten
a
minute
more
and
the
same
interval
have
you
been
out
no
and
do
want
to
perhaps
if
i
could
only
come
back
again
i
should
i
could
spare
an
arm
i
should
want
to
lose
a
leg
if
i
should
lose
my
head
why
so
i
should
want
nothing
more
have
many
gone
from
here
yes
many
lost
yes
good
few
only
two
teams
work
on
the
farm
this
year
one
of
my
mates
is
dead
the
second
day
in
france
they
killed
him
it
was
back
in
march
the
very
night
of
the
blizzard
too
now
if
he
had
stayed
here
we
should
have
moved
the
tree
and
i
should
not
have
sat
here
everything
would
have
been
different
for
it
would
have
been
another
world
ay
and
a
better
though
if
we
could
see
all
all
might
seem
good
then
the
lovers
came
out
of
the
wood
again
the
horses
started
and
for
the
last
time
i
watched
the
clods
crumble
and
topple
over
after
the
ploughshare
and
the
stumbling
team
thaw
over
the
land
freckled
with
snow
the
speculating
rooks
at
their
nests
cawed
and
saw
from
delicate
as
flower
of
grass
what
we
below
could
not
see
winter
pass
interval
gone
the
wild
day
a
wilder
night
coming
makes
way
for
brief
twilight
where
the
firm
soaked
road
mounts
and
is
lost
in
the
high
it
shines
almost
the
beeches
keep
a
stormy
rest
breathing
deep
of
wind
from
the
west
the
wood
is
black
with
a
misty
steam
above
the
cloud
pack
breaks
for
one
gleam
but
the
woodman
cot
by
the
ivied
trees
awakens
not
to
light
or
breeze
it
smokes
aloft
unwavering
it
hunches
soft
under
storm
wing
it
has
no
care
for
gleam
or
gloom
it
stays
there
while
i
shall
roam
die
and
forget
the
hill
of
trees
the
gleam
the
wet
this
roaring
peace
like
the
touch
of
rain
like
the
touch
of
rain
she
was
on
a
man
flesh
and
hair
and
eyes
when
the
joy
of
walking
thus
has
taken
him
by
surprise
with
the
love
of
the
storm
he
burns
he
sings
he
laughs
well
i
know
how
but
forgets
when
he
returns
as
i
shall
not
forget
her
go
now
those
two
words
shut
a
door
between
me
and
the
blessed
rain
that
was
never
shut
before
and
will
not
open
again
the
path
running
along
a
bank
a
parapet
that
saves
from
the
precipitous
wood
below
the
level
road
there
is
a
path
it
serves
children
for
looking
down
the
long
smooth
steep
between
the
legs
of
beech
and
yew
to
where
a
fallen
tree
checks
the
sight
while
men
and
women
content
themselves
with
the
road
and
what
they
see
over
the
bank
and
what
the
children
tell
the
path
winding
like
silver
trickles
on
bordered
and
even
invaded
by
thinnest
moss
that
tries
to
cover
roots
and
crumbling
chalk
with
gold
olive
and
emerald
but
in
vain
the
children
wear
it
they
have
flattened
the
bank
on
top
and
silvered
it
between
the
moss
with
the
current
of
their
feet
year
after
year
but
the
road
is
houseless
and
leads
not
to
school
to
see
a
child
is
rare
there
and
the
eye
has
but
the
road
the
wood
that
overhangs
and
underyawns
it
and
the
path
that
looks
as
if
it
led
on
to
some
legendary
or
fancied
place
where
men
have
wished
to
go
and
stay
till
sudden
it
ends
where
the
wood
ends
the
combe
the
combe
was
ever
dark
ancient
and
dark
its
mouth
is
stopped
with
bramble
thorn
and
briar
and
no
one
scrambles
over
the
sliding
chalk
by
beech
and
yew
and
perishing
juniper
down
the
half
precipices
of
its
sides
with
roots
and
rabbit
holes
for
steps
the
sun
of
winter
the
moon
of
summer
and
all
the
singing
birds
except
the
that
loves
juniper
are
quite
shut
out
but
far
more
ancient
and
dark
the
combe
looks
since
they
killed
the
badger
there
dug
him
out
and
gave
him
to
the
hounds
that
most
ancient
briton
of
english
beasts
if
i
should
ever
by
chance
if
i
should
ever
by
chance
grow
rich
i
buy
codham
cockridden
and
childerditch
roses
pyrgo
and
lapwater
and
let
them
all
to
my
elder
daughter
the
rent
i
shall
ask
of
her
will
be
only
each
year
first
violets
white
and
lonely
the
first
primroses
and
orchises
she
must
find
them
before
i
do
that
is
but
if
she
finds
a
blossom
on
furze
without
rent
they
shall
all
for
ever
be
hers
codham
cockridden
and
childerditch
roses
pyrgo
and
lapwater
i
shall
give
them
all
to
my
elder
daughter
what
shall
i
give
what
shall
i
give
my
daughter
the
younger
more
than
will
keep
her
from
cold
and
hunger
i
shall
not
give
her
anything
if
she
shared
south
weald
and
havering
their
acres
the
two
brooks
running
between
paine
brook
and
weald
brook
with
pewit
woodpecker
swan
and
rook
she
would
be
no
richer
than
the
queen
who
once
on
a
time
sat
in
havering
bower
alone
with
the
shadows
pleasure
and
power
she
could
do
no
more
with
samarcand
or
the
mountains
of
a
mountain
land
and
its
far
white
house
above
cottages
like
venus
above
the
pleiades
her
small
hands
i
would
not
cumber
with
so
many
acres
and
their
lumber
but
leave
her
steep
and
her
own
world
and
her
spectacled
self
with
hair
uncurled
wanting
a
thousand
little
things
that
time
without
contentment
brings
if
i
were
to
own
if
i
were
to
own
this
countryside
as
far
as
a
man
in
a
day
could
ride
and
the
tyes
were
mine
for
giving
or
letting
wingle
tye
and
margaretting
tye
and
skreens
gooshays
and
cockerells
shellow
rochetts
bandish
and
pickerells
marlins
lambkins
and
lillyputs
their
copses
ponds
roads
and
ruts
fields
where
steam
and
plovers
fling
and
whimper
hedges
that
lovers
love
and
orchards
shrubberies
walls
where
the
sun
untroubled
by
north
wind
falls
and
single
trees
where
the
thrush
sings
well
his
proverbs
untranslatable
i
would
give
them
all
to
my
son
if
he
would
let
me
any
one
for
a
song
a
blackbird
song
at
dawn
he
should
have
no
more
till
on
my
lawn
never
a
one
was
left
because
i
had
shot
them
to
put
them
into
a
pie
his
essex
blackbirds
every
one
and
i
was
left
old
and
alone
then
unless
i
could
pay
for
rent
a
song
as
sweet
as
a
blackbird
and
as
long
no
more
he
should
have
the
house
not
i
margaretting
or
wingle
tye
or
it
might
be
skreens
gooshays
or
cockerells
shellow
rochetts
bandish
or
pickerells
martins
lambkins
or
lillyputs
should
be
his
till
the
cart
tracks
had
no
ruts
and
you
helen
and
you
helen
what
should
i
give
you
so
many
things
i
would
give
you
had
i
an
infinite
great
store
offered
me
and
i
stood
before
to
choose
i
would
give
you
youth
all
kinds
of
loveliness
and
truth
a
clear
eye
as
good
as
mine
lands
waters
flowers
wine
as
many
children
as
your
heart
might
wish
for
a
far
better
art
than
mine
can
be
all
you
have
lost
upon
the
travelling
waters
tossed
or
given
to
me
if
i
could
choose
freely
in
that
great
anything
from
any
shelf
i
would
give
you
back
yourself
and
power
to
discriminate
what
you
want
and
want
it
not
too
late
many
fair
days
free
from
care
and
heart
to
enjoy
both
foul
and
fair
and
myself
too
if
i
could
find
where
it
lay
hidden
and
it
proved
kind
when
first
when
first
i
came
here
i
had
hope
hope
for
i
knew
not
what
fast
beat
my
heart
at
sight
of
the
tall
slope
or
grass
and
yews
as
if
my
feet
only
by
scaling
its
steps
of
chalk
would
see
something
no
other
hill
ever
disclosed
and
now
i
walk
down
it
the
last
time
never
will
my
heart
beat
so
again
at
sight
of
any
hill
although
as
fair
and
loftier
for
infinite
the
change
late
unperceived
this
year
the
twelfth
suddenly
shows
me
plain
hope
now
not
health
nor
cheerfulness
since
they
can
come
and
go
again
as
often
one
brief
hour
witnesses
just
hope
has
gone
for
ever
perhaps
i
may
love
other
hills
yet
more
than
this
the
future
and
the
maps
hide
something
i
was
waiting
for
one
thing
i
know
that
love
with
chance
and
use
and
time
and
necessity
will
grow
and
louder
the
heart
dance
at
parting
than
at
meeting
be
head
and
bottle
the
downs
will
lose
the
sun
white
alyssum
lose
the
bees
hum
but
head
and
bottle
tilted
back
in
the
cart
will
never
part
till
i
am
cold
as
midnight
and
all
my
hours
are
beeless
flowers
he
neither
sees
nor
hears
nor
smells
nor
thinks
but
only
drinks
quiet
in
the
yard
where
tree
trunks
do
not
lie
more
quietly
after
you
speak
after
you
speak
and
what
you
meant
is
plain
my
eyes
meet
yours
that
mean
with
your
cheeks
and
hair
something
more
wise
more
dark
and
far
different
even
so
the
lark
loves
dust
and
nestles
in
it
the
minute
before
he
must
soar
in
lone
flight
so
far
like
a
black
star
he
seems
a
mote
of
singing
dust
afloat
above
that
dreams
and
sheds
no
light
i
know
your
lust
is
love
sowing
it
was
a
perfect
day
for
sowing
just
as
sweet
and
dry
was
the
ground
as
i
tasted
deep
the
hour
between
the
far
owl
chuckling
first
soft
cry
and
the
first
star
a
long
stretched
hour
it
was
nothing
undone
remained
the
early
seeds
all
safely
sown
and
now
hark
at
the
rain
windless
and
light
half
a
kiss
half
a
tear
saying
when
we
two
walked
when
we
two
walked
in
lent
we
imagined
that
happiness
was
something
different
and
this
was
something
less
but
happy
were
we
to
hide
our
happiness
not
as
they
were
who
acted
in
their
pride
juno
and
jupiter
for
the
gods
in
their
jealousy
murdered
that
wife
and
man
and
we
that
were
wise
live
free
to
recall
our
happiness
then
in
memoriam
easter
the
flowers
left
thick
at
nightfall
in
the
wood
this
eastertide
call
into
mind
the
men
now
far
from
home
who
with
their
sweethearts
should
have
gathered
them
and
will
do
never
again
fifty
faggots
there
they
stand
on
their
ends
the
fifty
faggots
that
once
were
underwood
of
hazel
and
ash
in
jenny
pinks
copse
now
by
the
hedge
close
packed
they
make
a
thicket
fancy
alone
can
creep
through
with
the
mouse
and
wren
next
spring
a
blackbird
or
a
robin
will
nest
there
accustomed
to
them
thinking
they
will
remain
whatever
is
for
ever
to
a
bird
this
spring
it
is
too
late
the
swift
has
come
was
a
hot
day
for
carrying
them
up
better
they
will
never
warm
me
though
they
must
light
several
winters
fires
before
they
are
done
the
war
will
have
ended
many
other
things
have
ended
maybe
that
i
can
no
more
foresee
or
more
control
than
robin
and
wren
women
he
liked
women
he
liked
did
bob
old
farmer
hayward
of
the
heath
but
he
loved
horses
he
himself
was
like
a
cob
and
also
he
loved
a
tree
for
the
life
in
them
he
loved
most
living
things
but
a
tree
chiefly
all
along
the
lane
he
planted
elms
where
now
the
stormcock
sings
that
travellers
hear
from
the
train
till
then
the
track
had
never
had
a
name
for
all
its
thicket
and
the
nightingales
that
should
have
earned
it
no
one
was
to
blame
to
name
a
thing
beloved
man
sometimes
fails
many
years
since
bob
hayward
died
and
now
none
passes
there
because
the
mist
and
the
rain
out
of
the
elms
have
turned
the
lane
to
slough
and
gloom
the
name
alone
survives
bob
lane
early
one
morning
early
one
morning
in
may
i
set
out
and
nobody
i
knew
was
about
i
bound
away
for
ever
away
somewhere
away
for
ever
there
was
no
wind
to
trouble
the
weathercocks
i
had
burnt
my
letters
and
darned
my
socks
no
one
knew
i
was
going
away
i
thought
myself
i
should
come
back
some
day
i
heard
the
brook
through
the
town
gardens
run
o
sweet
was
the
mud
turned
to
dust
by
the
sun
a
gate
banged
in
a
fence
and
banged
in
my
head
a
fine
morning
sir
a
shepherd
said
i
could
not
return
from
my
liberty
to
my
youth
and
my
love
and
my
misery
the
past
is
the
only
dead
thing
that
smells
sweet
the
only
sweet
thing
that
is
not
also
fleet
i
bound
away
for
ever
away
somewhere
away
for
ever
the
cherry
trees
the
cherry
trees
bend
over
and
are
shedding
on
the
old
road
where
all
that
passed
are
dead
their
petals
strewing
the
grass
as
for
a
wedding
this
early
may
morn
when
there
is
none
to
wed
it
rains
it
rains
and
nothing
stirs
within
the
fence
anywhere
through
the
orchard
untrodden
dense
forest
of
parsley
the
great
diamonds
of
rain
on
the
grassblades
there
is
none
to
break
or
the
fallen
petals
further
down
to
shake
and
i
am
nearly
as
happy
as
possible
to
search
the
wilderness
in
vain
though
well
to
think
of
two
walking
kissing
there
drenched
yet
forgetting
the
kisses
of
the
rain
sad
too
to
think
that
never
never
again
unless
alone
so
happy
shall
i
walk
in
the
rain
when
i
turn
away
on
its
fine
stalk
twilight
has
fined
to
naught
the
parsley
flower
figures
suspended
still
and
ghostly
white
the
past
hovering
as
it
revisits
the
light
the
huxter
he
has
a
hump
like
an
ape
on
his
back
he
has
of
money
a
plentiful
lack
and
but
for
a
gay
coat
of
double
his
girth
there
is
not
a
plainer
thing
on
the
earth
this
fine
may
morning
but
the
huxter
has
a
bottle
of
beer
he
drives
a
cart
and
his
wife
sits
near
who
does
not
heed
his
lack
or
his
hump
and
they
laugh
as
down
the
lane
they
bump
this
fine
may
morning
a
gentleman
he
has
robbed
two
clubs
the
judge
at
salisbury
ca
give
him
more
than
he
undoubtedly
deserves
the
scoundrel
look
at
his
photograph
a
hanging
too
good
by
half
for
such
as
he
so
said
the
stranger
one
with
crimes
yet
undiscovered
or
undone
but
at
the
inn
the
gipsy
dame
began
now
he
was
what
i
call
a
gentleman
he
went
along
with
carrie
and
when
she
had
a
baby
he
paid
up
so
readily
his
half
a
crown
just
like
him
a
crown
have
been
more
like
him
for
i
never
knew
him
mean
oh
but
he
was
such
a
nice
gentleman
oh
last
time
we
met
he
said
if
me
and
joe
was
anywhere
near
we
must
be
sure
and
call
he
put
his
arms
around
our
amos
all
as
if
he
were
his
own
son
i
pray
god
save
him
from
justice
nicer
man
never
trod
the
bridge
i
have
come
a
long
way
on
a
strange
bridge
alone
remembering
friends
old
friends
i
rest
without
smile
or
moan
as
they
remember
me
without
smile
or
moan
all
are
behind
the
kind
and
the
unkind
too
no
more
than
a
dream
the
stream
runs
softly
yet
drowns
the
past
the
stream
has
drowned
the
future
and
the
past
no
traveller
has
rest
more
blest
than
this
moment
brief
between
two
lives
when
the
night
first
lights
and
shades
hide
what
has
never
been
things
goodlier
lovelier
dearer
than
will
be
or
have
been
lob
at
in
wiltshire
travelling
in
search
of
something
chance
would
never
bring
an
old
man
face
by
life
and
weather
cut
and
coloured
rough
brown
sweet
as
any
nut
a
land
face
hung
in
my
mind
when
i
had
left
him
many
a
mile
behind
all
he
said
was
nobody
ca
stop
a
footpath
right
enough
you
see
those
bits
of
mounds
that
where
they
opened
up
the
barrows
sixty
years
since
while
i
was
scaring
sparrows
they
thought
as
there
was
something
to
find
there
but
could
find
it
by
digging
anywhere
to
turn
back
then
and
seek
him
where
was
the
use
there
were
three
manningfords
abbots
bohun
and
bruce
and
whether
alton
not
manningford
it
was
my
memory
could
not
decide
because
there
was
both
alton
barnes
and
alton
priors
all
had
their
churches
graveyards
farms
and
byres
lurking
to
one
side
up
the
paths
and
lanes
seldom
well
seen
except
by
aeroplanes
and
when
bells
rang
or
pigs
squealed
or
cocks
crowed
then
only
heard
ages
ago
the
road
approached
the
people
stood
and
looked
and
turned
nor
asked
it
to
come
nearer
nor
yet
learned
to
move
out
there
and
dwell
in
all
men
dust
and
yet
withal
they
shot
the
weathercock
just
because
was
he
crowed
out
of
tune
they
said
so
now
the
copper
weathercock
is
dead
if
they
had
reaped
their
dandelions
and
sold
them
fairly
they
could
have
afforded
gold
many
years
passed
and
i
went
back
again
among
those
villages
and
looked
for
men
who
might
have
known
my
ancient
he
himself
had
long
been
dead
or
laid
upon
the
shelf
i
thought
one
man
i
asked
about
him
roared
at
my
description
is
old
bottlesford
he
means
bill
but
another
said
of
course
it
was
jack
button
up
at
the
white
horse
he
dead
sir
these
three
years
this
lasted
till
a
girl
proposed
walker
of
walker
hill
old
adam
walker
adam
point
you
see
marked
on
the
maps
that
was
her
roguery
the
next
man
said
he
was
a
squire
son
who
loved
wild
bird
and
beast
and
dog
and
gun
for
killing
them
he
had
loved
them
from
his
birth
one
with
another
as
he
loved
the
earth
the
man
may
be
like
button
or
walker
or
like
bottlesford
that
you
want
but
far
more
he
sounds
like
one
i
saw
when
i
was
a
child
i
could
almost
swear
to
him
the
man
was
wild
and
wandered
his
home
was
where
he
was
free
everybody
has
met
one
such
man
as
he
does
he
keep
clear
old
paths
that
no
one
uses
but
once
a
when
he
loves
or
muses
he
is
english
as
this
gate
these
flowers
this
mire
and
when
at
eight
years
old
came
in
my
books
this
was
the
man
i
saw
he
has
been
in
england
as
long
as
dove
and
daw
calling
the
wild
cherry
tree
the
merry
tree
the
rose
campion
and
in
a
tender
mood
he
as
i
guess
christened
one
flower
and
while
he
walked
from
exeter
to
leeds
one
april
called
all
milkmaids
from
him
old
herbal
gerard
learnt
as
a
boy
to
name
wild
clematis
the
our
blackbirds
sang
no
english
till
his
ear
told
him
they
called
his
jan
toy
dear
she
was
jan
toy
the
lucky
who
having
lost
a
shilling
and
found
a
penny
loaf
rejoiced
for
reasons
of
his
own
to
him
the
wren
is
jenny
pooter
before
all
other
men
he
first
called
the
hog
back
the
hog
back
that
mother
dunch
buttocks
should
not
lack
their
name
was
his
care
he
too
could
explain
totteridge
and
totterdown
and
juggler
lane
he
knows
if
anyone
why
tumbling
bay
inland
in
kent
is
called
so
he
might
say
but
little
he
says
compared
with
what
he
does
if
ever
a
sage
troubles
him
he
will
buzz
like
a
beehive
to
conclude
the
tedious
fray
and
the
sage
who
knows
all
languages
runs
away
yet
lob
has
thirteen
hundred
names
for
a
fool
and
though
he
never
could
spare
time
for
school
to
unteach
what
the
fox
so
well
expressed
on
biting
the
cock
head
off
quietness
is
best
he
can
talk
quite
as
well
as
anyone
after
his
thinking
is
forgot
and
done
he
first
of
all
told
someone
else
wife
for
a
farthing
she
skin
a
flint
and
spoil
a
knife
worth
sixpence
skinning
it
she
heard
him
speak
had
a
face
as
long
as
a
wet
said
he
telling
the
tale
in
after
years
with
blue
smock
and
with
gold
rings
in
his
ears
sometimes
he
is
a
pedlar
not
too
poor
to
keep
his
wit
this
is
tall
tom
that
bore
the
logs
in
and
with
shakespeare
in
the
hall
once
talked
when
icicles
hung
by
the
wall
as
herne
the
hunter
he
has
known
hard
times
on
sleepless
nights
he
made
up
weather
rhymes
which
others
spoilt
and
hob
being
then
his
name
he
kept
the
hog
that
thought
the
butcher
came
to
bring
his
breakfast
thought
wrong
said
hob
when
there
were
kings
in
kent
this
very
lob
whose
sheep
grew
fat
and
he
himself
grew
merry
wedded
the
king
daughter
of
canterbury
for
he
alone
unlike
squire
lord
and
king
watched
a
night
by
her
without
slumbering
he
kept
both
waking
when
he
was
but
a
lad
he
won
a
rich
man
heiress
deaf
dumb
and
sad
by
rousing
her
to
laugh
at
him
he
carried
his
donkey
on
his
back
so
they
were
married
and
while
he
was
a
little
cobbler
boy
he
tricked
the
giant
coming
to
destroy
shrewsbury
by
flood
how
far
is
it
yet
the
giant
asked
in
passing
forget
but
see
these
shoes
i
worn
out
on
the
road
and
we
not
there
yet
he
emptied
out
his
load
of
shoes
for
mending
the
giant
let
fall
from
his
spade
the
earth
for
damming
severn
and
thus
made
the
wrekin
hill
and
little
ercall
hill
rose
where
the
giant
scraped
his
boots
while
still
so
young
our
jack
was
chief
of
gotham
sages
but
long
before
he
could
have
been
wise
ages
earlier
than
this
while
he
grew
thick
and
strong
and
ate
his
bacon
or
at
times
sang
a
song
and
merely
smelt
it
as
jack
the
he
made
a
name
he
too
ground
up
the
miller
the
yorkshireman
who
ground
men
bones
for
flour
do
you
believe
jack
dead
before
his
hour
or
that
his
name
is
walker
or
bottlesford
or
button
a
mere
clown
or
squire
or
lord
the
man
you
saw
jack
cade
jack
smith
jack
moon
poor
jack
of
every
trade
young
jack
or
old
jack
or
jack
d
or
robin
hood
ragged
robin
lazy
bob
one
of
the
lords
of
no
man
land
good
lob
although
he
was
seen
dying
at
waterloo
hastings
agincourt
and
sedgemoor
too
lives
yet
he
never
will
admit
he
is
dead
till
millers
cease
to
grind
men
bones
for
bread
not
till
our
weathercock
crows
once
again
and
i
remove
my
house
out
of
the
lane
on
to
the
road
with
this
he
disappeared
in
hazel
and
thorn
tangled
with
but
one
glimpse
of
his
back
as
there
he
stood
choosing
his
way
proved
him
of
old
jack
blood
young
jack
perhaps
and
now
a
wiltshireman
as
he
has
oft
been
since
his
days
began
bright
clouds
bright
clouds
of
may
shade
half
the
pond
beyond
all
but
one
bay
of
emerald
tall
reeds
like
bayonets
where
a
bird
once
called
lies
bright
as
the
sun
no
one
heeds
the
light
wind
frets
and
drifts
the
scum
of
till
the
moorhen
calls
again
naught
to
be
done
by
birds
or
men
still
the
may
falls
the
clouds
that
are
so
light
the
clouds
that
are
so
light
beautiful
swift
and
bright
cast
shadows
on
field
and
park
of
the
earth
that
is
so
dark
and
even
so
now
light
one
beautiful
swift
and
bright
one
you
let
fall
on
a
heart
that
was
dark
unillumined
a
deeper
mark
but
clouds
would
have
without
earth
to
shadow
far
less
worth
away
from
your
shadow
on
me
your
beauty
less
would
be
and
if
it
still
be
treasured
an
age
hence
it
shall
be
measured
by
this
small
dark
spot
without
which
it
were
not
some
eyes
condemn
some
eyes
condemn
the
earth
they
gaze
upon
some
wait
patiently
till
they
know
far
more
than
earth
can
tell
them
some
laugh
at
the
whole
as
folly
of
another
making
one
i
knew
that
laughed
because
he
saw
from
core
to
rind
not
one
thing
worth
the
laugh
his
soul
had
ready
at
waking
some
eyes
have
begun
with
laughing
some
stand
startled
at
the
door
others
too
i
have
seen
rest
question
roll
dance
shoot
and
many
i
have
loved
watching
some
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
from
till
they
turned
and
loving
died
i
had
not
found
my
goal
but
thinking
of
your
eyes
dear
i
become
dumb
for
they
flamed
and
it
was
me
they
burned
may
there
never
was
a
finer
day
and
never
will
be
while
may
is
may
the
third
and
not
the
last
of
its
kind
but
though
fair
and
clear
the
two
behind
seemed
pursued
by
tempests
overpast
and
the
morrow
with
fear
that
it
could
not
last
was
spoiled
ere
the
stones
were
warm
five
minutes
of
thunderstorm
dashed
it
with
rain
as
if
to
secure
by
one
tear
its
beauty
the
luck
to
endure
at
then
along
the
lane
old
jack
noman
appeared
again
jaunty
and
old
crooked
and
tall
and
stopped
and
grinned
at
me
over
the
wall
with
a
cowslip
bunch
in
his
and
one
in
his
cap
who
could
say
if
his
roll
came
from
flints
in
the
road
the
weather
or
ale
he
was
welcome
as
the
nightingale
not
an
hour
of
the
sun
had
been
wasted
on
jack
i
got
my
indian
complexion
back
said
he
he
was
tanned
like
a
harvester
like
his
short
clay
pipe
like
the
leaf
and
bur
that
clung
to
his
coat
from
last
night
bed
like
the
ploughland
crumbling
red
fairer
flowers
were
none
on
the
earth
than
his
cowslips
wet
with
the
dew
of
their
birth
or
fresher
leaves
than
the
cress
in
his
basket
where
did
they
come
from
jack
do
ask
it
and
you
be
told
no
lies
very
well
then
i
ca
buy
i
do
want
to
sell
take
them
and
these
flowers
too
free
perhaps
you
have
something
to
give
me
wait
till
next
time
the
better
the
day
the
lord
could
make
a
better
i
say
if
he
could
he
never
has
done
so
off
went
jack
with
his
leaving
his
cresses
from
oakshott
rill
and
his
cowslips
from
wheatham
hill
was
the
first
day
that
the
midges
bit
but
though
they
bit
me
i
was
glad
of
it
of
the
dust
in
my
face
too
i
was
glad
spring
could
do
nothing
to
make
me
sad
bluebells
hid
all
the
ruts
in
the
copse
the
elm
seeds
lay
in
the
road
like
hops
that
fine
day
may
the
the
day
jack
noman
disappeared
the
glory
the
glory
of
the
beauty
of
the
morning
the
cuckoo
crying
over
the
untouched
dew
the
blackbird
that
has
found
it
and
the
dove
that
tempts
me
on
to
something
sweeter
than
love
white
clouds
ranged
even
and
fair
as
hay
the
heat
the
stir
the
sublime
vacancy
of
sky
and
meadow
and
forest
and
my
own
heart
the
glory
invites
me
yet
it
leaves
me
scorning
all
i
can
ever
do
all
i
can
be
beside
the
lovely
of
motion
shape
and
hue
the
happiness
i
fancy
fit
to
dwell
in
beauty
presence
shall
i
now
this
day
begin
to
seek
as
far
as
heaven
as
hell
wisdom
or
strength
to
match
this
beauty
start
and
tread
the
pale
dust
pitted
with
small
dark
drops
in
hope
to
find
whatever
it
is
i
seek
hearkening
to
things
that
we
know
naught
of
in
the
hazel
copse
or
must
i
be
content
with
discontent
as
larks
and
swallows
are
perhaps
with
wings
and
shall
i
ask
at
the
day
end
once
more
what
beauty
is
and
what
i
can
have
meant
by
happiness
and
shall
i
let
all
go
glad
weary
or
both
or
shall
i
perhaps
know
that
i
was
happy
oft
and
oft
before
awhile
forgetting
how
i
am
fast
pent
how
with
naught
to
travel
to
is
time
i
can
not
bite
the
day
to
the
core
melancholy
the
rain
and
wind
the
rain
and
wind
raved
endlessly
on
me
the
summer
storm
and
fever
and
melancholy
wrought
magic
so
that
if
i
feared
the
solitude
far
more
i
feared
all
company
too
sharp
too
rude
had
been
the
wisest
or
the
dearest
human
voice
what
i
desired
i
knew
not
but
my
choice
vain
it
must
be
i
knew
yet
naught
did
my
despair
but
sweeten
the
strange
sweetness
while
through
the
wild
air
all
day
long
i
heard
a
distant
cuckoo
calling
and
soft
as
dulcimers
sounds
of
near
water
falling
and
softer
and
remote
as
if
in
history
rumours
of
what
had
touched
my
friends
my
foes
or
me
adlestrop
yes
i
remember
adlestrop
the
name
because
one
afternoon
of
heat
the
drew
up
there
unwontedly
it
was
late
june
the
steam
hissed
someone
cleared
his
throat
no
one
left
and
no
one
came
on
the
bare
platform
what
i
saw
was
adlestrop
only
the
name
and
willows
and
grass
and
meadowsweet
and
haycocks
dry
no
whit
less
still
and
lonely
fair
than
the
high
cloudlets
in
the
sky
and
for
that
minute
a
blackbird
sang
close
by
and
round
him
mistier
farther
and
farther
all
the
birds
of
oxfordshire
and
gloucestershire
the
green
roads
the
green
roads
that
end
in
the
forest
are
strewn
with
white
goose
feathers
this
june
like
marks
left
behind
by
some
one
gone
to
the
forest
to
show
his
track
but
he
has
never
come
back
down
each
green
road
a
cottage
looks
at
the
forest
round
one
the
nettle
towers
two
are
bathed
in
flowers
an
old
man
along
the
green
road
to
the
forest
strays
from
one
from
another
a
child
alone
in
the
thicket
bordering
the
forest
all
day
long
a
thrush
twiddles
his
song
it
is
old
but
the
trees
are
young
in
the
forest
all
but
one
like
a
castle
keep
in
the
middle
deep
that
oak
saw
the
ages
pass
in
the
forest
they
were
a
host
but
their
memories
are
lost
for
the
tree
is
dead
all
things
forget
the
forest
excepting
perhaps
me
when
now
i
see
the
old
man
the
child
the
goose
feathers
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
hear
all
day
long
the
thrush
repeat
his
song
the
the
sun
blazed
while
the
thunder
yet
added
a
boom
a
wagtail
flickered
bright
over
the
gloom
less
than
the
cooing
in
the
alder
isles
of
the
pool
sounded
the
thunder
through
that
plunge
of
waters
cool
scared
starlings
on
the
aspen
tip
past
the
black
mill
outchattered
the
stream
and
the
next
roar
far
on
the
hill
as
my
feet
dangling
teased
the
foam
that
slid
below
a
girl
came
out
take
care
she
said
ages
ago
she
startled
me
standing
quite
close
dressed
all
in
white
ages
ago
i
was
angry
till
she
passed
from
sight
then
the
storm
burst
and
as
i
crouched
to
shelter
how
beautiful
and
kind
too
she
seemed
as
she
does
now
it
was
upon
it
was
upon
a
july
evening
at
a
stile
i
stood
looking
along
a
path
over
the
country
by
a
second
spring
drenched
perfect
green
again
the
lattermath
will
be
a
fine
one
so
the
stranger
said
a
wandering
man
albeit
i
stood
at
rest
flushed
with
desire
i
was
the
earth
outspread
like
meadows
of
the
future
i
possessed
and
as
an
unaccomplished
prophecy
the
stranger
words
after
the
interval
of
a
score
years
when
those
fields
are
by
me
never
to
be
recrossed
now
i
recall
this
july
eve
and
question
wondering
what
of
the
lattermath
to
this
hoar
spring
tall
nettles
tall
nettles
cover
up
as
they
have
done
these
many
springs
the
rusty
harrow
the
plough
long
worn
out
and
the
roller
made
of
stone
only
the
elm
butt
tops
the
nettles
now
this
corner
of
the
farmyard
i
like
most
as
well
as
any
bloom
upon
a
flower
i
like
the
dust
on
the
nettles
never
lost
except
to
prove
the
sweetness
of
a
shower
haymaking
after
night
thunder
far
away
had
rolled
the
fiery
day
had
a
kernel
sweet
of
cold
and
in
the
perfect
blue
the
clouds
uncurled
like
the
first
gods
before
they
made
the
world
and
misery
swimming
the
stormless
sea
in
beauty
and
in
divine
gaiety
the
smooth
white
empty
road
was
lightly
strewn
with
leaves
the
holly
autumn
falls
in
june
and
fir
cones
standing
stiff
up
in
the
heat
the
water
tumbled
white
and
lit
with
tossing
crystals
happier
than
any
crowd
of
children
pouring
out
of
school
aloud
and
in
the
little
thickets
where
a
sleeper
for
ever
might
lie
lost
the
and
garden
warbler
sang
unceasingly
while
over
them
shrill
shrieked
in
his
fierce
glee
the
swift
with
wings
and
tail
as
sharp
and
narrow
as
if
the
bow
had
flown
off
with
the
arrow
only
the
scent
of
woodbine
and
hay
travelled
the
road
in
the
field
sloping
down
to
where
its
willows
showed
the
brook
haymakers
rested
the
tosser
lay
forsook
out
in
the
sun
and
the
long
waggon
stood
without
its
team
it
seemed
it
never
would
move
from
the
shadow
of
that
single
yew
the
team
as
still
until
their
task
was
due
beside
the
labourers
enjoyed
the
shade
that
three
squat
oaks
together
made
upon
a
circle
of
grass
and
weed
uncut
and
on
the
hollow
once
a
but
now
brimmed
with
nut
and
so
clean
the
men
leaned
on
their
rakes
about
to
begin
but
still
and
all
were
silent
all
was
old
this
morning
time
with
a
great
age
untold
older
than
clare
and
cobbett
morland
and
crome
than
at
the
field
far
edge
the
farmer
home
a
white
house
crouched
at
the
foot
of
a
great
tree
under
the
heavens
that
know
not
what
years
be
the
men
the
beasts
the
trees
the
implements
uttered
even
what
they
will
in
times
far
hence
all
of
us
gone
out
of
the
reach
of
change
immortal
in
a
picture
of
an
old
grange
how
at
once
how
at
once
should
i
know
when
stretched
in
the
harvest
blue
i
saw
the
swift
black
bow
that
i
would
not
have
that
view
another
day
until
next
may
again
it
is
due
the
same
year
after
year
but
with
the
swift
alone
with
other
things
i
but
fear
that
they
will
be
over
and
done
suddenly
and
i
only
see
them
to
know
them
gone
gone
gone
again
gone
gone
again
may
june
july
and
august
gone
again
gone
by
not
memorable
save
that
i
saw
them
go
as
past
the
empty
quays
the
rivers
flow
and
now
again
in
the
harvest
rain
the
blenheim
oranges
fall
grubby
from
the
trees
as
when
i
was
young
and
when
the
lost
one
was
here
and
when
the
war
began
to
turn
young
men
to
dung
look
at
the
old
house
outmoded
dignified
dark
and
untenanted
with
grass
growing
instead
of
the
footsteps
of
life
the
friendliness
the
strife
in
its
beds
have
lain
youth
love
age
and
pain
i
am
something
like
that
only
i
am
not
dead
still
breathing
and
interested
in
the
house
that
is
not
dark
i
am
something
like
that
not
one
pane
to
reflect
the
sun
for
the
schoolboys
to
throw
at
they
have
broken
every
one
the
sun
used
to
shine
the
sun
used
to
shine
while
we
two
walked
slowly
together
paused
and
started
again
and
sometimes
mused
sometimes
talked
as
either
pleased
and
cheerfully
parted
each
night
we
never
disagreed
which
gate
to
rest
on
the
to
be
and
the
late
past
we
gave
small
heed
we
turned
from
men
or
poetry
to
rumours
of
the
war
remote
only
till
both
stood
disinclined
for
aught
but
the
yellow
flavorous
coat
of
an
apple
wasps
had
undermined
or
a
sentry
of
dark
betonies
the
stateliest
of
small
flowers
on
earth
at
the
forest
verge
or
crocuses
pale
purple
as
if
they
had
their
birth
in
sunless
hades
fields
the
war
came
back
to
mind
with
the
moonrise
which
soldiers
in
the
east
afar
beheld
then
nevertheless
our
eyes
could
as
well
imagine
the
crusades
or
caesar
battles
everything
to
faintness
like
those
rumours
fades
like
the
brook
water
glittering
under
the
moonlight
like
those
walks
now
like
us
two
that
took
them
and
the
fallen
apples
all
the
talks
and
silences
like
memory
sand
when
the
tide
covers
it
late
or
soon
and
other
men
through
other
flowers
in
those
fields
under
the
same
moon
go
talking
and
have
easy
hours
october
the
green
elm
with
the
one
great
bough
of
gold
lets
leaves
into
the
grass
slip
one
by
one
the
short
hill
grass
the
mushrooms
small
harebell
and
scabious
and
tormentil
that
blackberry
and
gorse
in
dew
and
sun
bow
down
to
and
the
wind
travels
too
light
to
shake
the
fallen
birch
leaves
from
the
fern
the
gossamers
wander
at
their
own
will
at
heavier
steps
than
birds
the
squirrels
scold
the
rich
scene
has
grown
fresh
again
and
new
as
spring
and
to
the
touch
is
not
more
cool
than
it
is
warm
to
the
gaze
and
now
i
might
as
happy
be
as
earth
is
beautiful
were
i
some
other
or
with
earth
could
turn
in
alternation
of
violet
and
rose
harebell
and
snowdrop
at
their
season
due
and
gorse
that
has
no
time
not
to
be
gay
but
if
this
be
not
happiness
who
knows
some
day
i
shall
think
this
a
happy
day
and
this
mood
by
the
name
of
melancholy
shall
no
more
blackened
and
obscured
be
the
long
small
room
the
long
small
room
that
showed
willows
in
the
west
narrowed
up
to
the
end
the
fireplace
filled
although
not
wide
i
liked
it
no
one
guessed
what
need
or
accident
made
them
so
build
only
the
moon
the
mouse
and
the
sparrow
peeped
in
from
the
ivy
round
the
casement
thick
of
all
they
saw
and
heard
there
they
shall
keep
the
tale
for
the
old
ivy
and
older
brick
when
i
look
back
i
am
like
moon
sparrow
and
mouse
that
witnessed
what
they
could
never
understand
or
alter
or
prevent
in
the
dark
house
one
thing
remains
the
same
this
my
right
hand
crawling
over
the
clean
white
page
resting
awhile
each
morning
on
the
pillow
then
once
more
starting
to
crawl
on
towards
age
the
hundred
last
leaves
stream
upon
the
willow
liberty
the
last
light
has
gone
out
of
the
world
except
this
moonlight
lying
on
the
grass
like
frost
beyond
the
brink
of
the
tall
elm
shadow
it
is
as
if
everything
else
had
slept
many
an
age
unforgotten
and
lost
the
men
that
were
the
things
done
long
ago
all
i
have
thought
and
but
the
moon
and
i
live
yet
and
here
stand
idle
over
the
grave
where
all
is
buried
both
have
liberty
to
dream
what
we
could
do
if
we
were
free
to
do
some
thing
we
had
desired
long
the
moon
and
i
there
none
less
free
than
who
does
nothing
and
has
nothing
else
to
do
being
free
only
for
what
is
not
to
his
mind
and
nothing
is
to
his
mind
if
every
hour
like
this
one
passing
that
i
have
spent
among
the
wiser
others
when
i
have
forgot
to
wonder
whether
i
was
free
or
not
were
piled
before
me
and
not
lost
behind
and
i
could
take
and
carry
them
away
i
should
be
rich
or
if
i
had
the
power
to
wipe
out
every
one
and
not
again
regret
i
should
be
rich
to
be
so
poor
and
yet
i
still
am
half
in
love
with
pain
with
what
is
imperfect
with
both
tears
and
mirth
with
things
that
have
an
end
with
life
and
earth
and
this
moon
that
leaves
me
dark
within
the
door
november
november
days
are
thirty
november
earth
is
dirty
those
thirty
days
from
first
to
last
and
the
prettiest
things
on
ground
are
the
paths
with
morning
and
evening
hobnails
dinted
with
foot
and
overprinted
or
separately
charactered
of
little
beast
and
little
bird
the
fields
are
mashed
by
sheep
the
roads
make
the
worst
going
the
best
the
woods
where
dead
leaves
upward
and
downward
scatter
few
care
for
the
mixture
of
earth
and
water
twig
leaf
flint
thorn
straw
feather
all
that
men
scorn
pounded
up
and
sodden
by
flood
condemned
as
mud
but
of
all
the
months
when
earth
is
greener
not
one
has
clean
skies
that
are
cleaner
clean
and
clear
and
sweet
and
cold
they
shine
above
the
earth
so
old
while
the
cloud
sails
over
in
silence
though
winds
are
loud
till
the
full
moon
in
the
east
looks
at
the
planet
in
the
west
and
earth
is
silent
as
it
is
black
yet
not
unhappy
for
its
lack
up
from
the
dirty
earth
men
stare
one
imagines
a
refuge
there
above
the
mud
in
the
pure
bright
of
the
cloudless
heavenly
light
another
loves
earth
and
november
more
dearly
because
without
them
he
sees
clearly
the
sky
would
be
nothing
more
to
his
eye
than
he
in
any
case
is
to
the
sky
he
loves
even
the
mud
whose
dyes
renounce
all
brightness
to
the
skies
the
sheiling
it
stands
alone
up
in
a
land
of
stone
all
worn
like
ancient
stairs
a
land
of
rocks
and
trees
nourished
on
wind
and
stone
and
all
within
long
delicate
has
been
by
arts
and
kindliness
coloured
sweetened
and
warmed
for
many
years
has
been
safe
resting
there
men
hear
in
the
travelling
air
but
music
pictures
see
in
the
same
daily
land
painted
by
the
wild
air
one
maker
mind
made
both
and
the
house
is
kind
to
the
land
that
gave
it
peace
and
the
stone
has
taken
the
house
to
its
cold
heart
and
is
kind
the
gallows
there
was
a
weasel
lived
in
the
sun
with
all
his
family
till
a
keeper
shot
him
with
his
gun
and
hung
him
up
on
a
tree
where
he
swings
in
the
wind
and
rain
in
the
sun
and
in
the
snow
without
pleasure
without
pain
on
the
dead
oak
tree
bough
there
was
a
crow
who
was
no
sleeper
but
a
thief
and
a
murderer
till
a
very
late
hour
and
this
keeper
made
him
one
of
the
things
that
were
to
hang
and
flap
in
rain
and
wind
in
the
sun
and
in
the
snow
there
are
no
more
sins
to
be
sinned
on
the
dead
oak
tree
bough
there
was
a
magpie
too
had
a
long
tongue
and
a
long
tail
he
could
both
talk
and
do
but
what
did
that
avail
he
too
flaps
in
the
wind
and
rain
alongside
weasel
and
crow
without
pleasure
without
pain
on
the
dead
oak
tree
bough
and
many
other
beasts
and
birds
skin
bone
and
feather
have
been
taken
from
their
feasts
and
hung
up
there
together
to
swing
and
have
endless
leisure
in
the
sun
and
in
the
snow
without
pain
without
pleasure
on
the
dead
oak
tree
bough
birds
nests
the
summer
nests
uncovered
by
autumn
wind
some
torn
others
dislodged
all
dark
everyone
sees
them
low
or
high
in
tree
or
hedge
or
single
bush
they
hang
like
a
mark
since
there
no
need
of
eyes
to
see
them
with
i
can
not
help
a
little
shame
that
i
missed
most
even
at
eye
level
till
the
leaves
blew
off
and
made
the
seeing
no
game
is
a
light
pang
i
like
to
see
the
nests
still
in
their
places
now
first
known
at
home
and
by
far
roads
boys
knew
them
not
whatever
jays
and
squirrels
may
have
done
and
most
i
like
the
winter
nests
that
leaves
and
berries
fell
into
once
a
dormouse
dined
there
on
and
grass
and
seeds
found
soil
and
grew
rain
rain
midnight
rain
nothing
but
the
wild
rain
on
this
bleak
hut
and
solitude
and
me
remembering
again
that
i
shall
die
and
neither
hear
the
rain
nor
give
it
thanks
for
washing
me
cleaner
than
i
have
been
since
i
was
born
into
this
solitude
blessed
are
the
dead
that
the
rain
rains
upon
but
here
i
pray
that
none
whom
once
i
loved
is
dying
or
lying
still
awake
solitary
listening
to
the
rain
either
in
pain
or
thus
in
sympathy
helpless
among
the
living
and
the
dead
like
a
cold
water
among
broken
reeds
myriads
of
broken
reeds
all
still
and
stiff
like
me
who
have
no
love
which
this
wild
rain
has
not
dissolved
except
the
love
of
death
if
love
it
be
towards
what
is
perfect
and
can
not
the
tempest
tells
me
disappoint
home
fair
was
the
morning
fair
our
tempers
and
we
had
seen
nothing
fairer
than
that
land
though
strange
and
the
untrodden
snow
that
made
wild
of
the
tame
casting
out
all
that
was
not
wild
and
rustic
and
old
and
we
were
glad
fair
too
was
afternoon
and
first
to
pass
were
we
that
league
of
snow
next
the
north
wind
there
was
nothing
to
return
for
except
need
and
yet
we
sang
nor
ever
stopped
for
speed
as
we
did
often
with
the
start
behind
faster
still
strode
we
when
we
came
in
sight
of
the
cold
roofs
where
we
must
spend
the
night
happy
we
had
not
been
there
nor
could
be
though
we
had
tasted
sleep
and
food
and
fellowship
together
long
how
quick
to
someone
lip
the
words
came
will
the
beaten
horse
run
home
the
word
home
raised
a
smile
in
us
all
three
and
one
repeated
it
smiling
just
so
that
all
knew
what
he
meant
and
none
would
say
between
three
counties
far
apart
that
lay
we
were
divided
and
looked
strangely
each
at
the
other
and
we
knew
we
were
not
friends
but
fellows
in
a
union
that
ends
with
the
necessity
for
it
as
it
ought
never
a
word
was
spoken
not
a
thought
was
thought
of
what
the
look
meant
with
the
word
home
as
we
walked
and
watched
the
sunset
blurred
and
then
to
me
the
word
only
the
word
homesick
as
it
were
playfully
occurred
no
more
if
i
should
ever
more
admit
than
the
mere
word
i
could
not
endure
it
for
a
day
longer
this
captivity
must
somehow
come
to
an
end
else
i
should
be
another
man
as
often
now
i
seem
or
this
life
be
only
an
evil
dream
there
nothing
like
the
sun
there
nothing
like
the
sun
as
the
year
dies
kind
as
it
can
be
this
world
being
made
so
to
stones
and
men
and
beasts
and
birds
and
flies
to
all
things
that
it
touches
except
snow
whether
on
mountain
side
or
street
of
town
the
south
wall
warms
me
november
has
begun
yet
never
shone
the
sun
as
fair
as
now
while
the
sweet
damsons
from
the
bough
with
spangles
of
the
morning
storm
drop
down
because
the
starling
shakes
it
whistling
what
once
swallows
sang
but
i
have
not
forgot
that
there
is
nothing
too
like
march
sun
like
april
or
july
or
june
or
may
or
january
or
february
great
days
and
august
september
october
and
december
have
equal
days
all
different
from
november
no
day
of
any
month
but
i
have
said
or
if
i
could
live
long
enough
should
say
there
nothing
like
the
sun
that
shines
there
nothing
like
the
sun
till
we
are
dead
when
he
should
laugh
when
he
should
laugh
the
wise
man
knows
full
well
for
he
knows
what
is
truly
laughable
but
wiser
is
the
man
who
laughs
also
or
holds
his
laughter
when
the
foolish
do
an
old
song
the
sun
set
the
wind
fell
the
sea
was
like
a
mirror
shaking
the
one
small
wave
that
clapped
the
land
a
snake
of
foam
was
making
where
tide
had
smoothed
and
wind
had
dried
the
vacant
sand
a
light
divided
the
swollen
clouds
and
lay
most
perfectly
like
a
straight
narrow
footbridge
bright
that
crossed
over
the
sea
to
me
and
no
one
else
in
the
whole
world
saw
that
same
sight
i
walked
elate
my
bridge
always
just
one
step
from
my
feet
a
robin
sang
a
shade
in
shade
and
all
i
did
was
to
repeat
i
go
no
more
with
you
fair
maid
the
sailors
song
of
merry
loving
with
dusk
and
mewing
mixed
sweet
the
lewdness
far
outweighed
by
the
wild
charm
the
chorus
played
i
go
no
more
with
you
fair
maid
since
roving
been
my
ruin
i
go
no
more
with
you
fair
maid
amsterdam
there
dwelt
a
maid
mark
well
what
i
do
say
in
amsterdam
there
dwelt
a
maid
and
she
was
a
mistress
of
her
trade
i
go
no
more
with
you
fair
maid
since
roving
been
my
ruin
i
go
no
more
with
you
fair
the
penny
whistle
the
new
moon
hangs
like
an
ivory
bugle
in
the
naked
frosty
blue
and
the
ghylls
of
the
forest
already
blackened
by
winter
are
blackened
anew
the
brooks
that
cut
up
and
increase
the
forest
as
if
they
had
never
known
the
sun
are
roaring
with
black
hollow
voices
betwixt
rage
and
a
moan
but
still
the
by
the
hollies
like
a
kingfisher
gleams
between
round
the
mossed
old
hearths
of
the
first
primroses
ask
to
be
seen
the
are
black
but
their
linen
blows
white
on
the
line
and
white
the
letter
the
girl
is
reading
under
that
crescent
fine
and
her
brother
who
hides
apart
in
a
thicket
slowly
and
surely
playing
on
a
whistle
an
olden
nursery
melody
says
far
more
than
i
am
saying
lights
out
i
have
come
to
the
borders
of
sleep
the
unfathomable
deep
forest
where
all
must
lose
their
way
however
straight
or
winding
soon
or
late
they
can
not
choose
many
a
road
and
track
that
since
the
dawn
first
crack
up
to
the
forest
brink
deceived
the
travellers
suddenly
now
blurs
and
in
they
sink
here
love
ends
despair
ambition
ends
all
pleasure
and
all
trouble
although
most
sweet
or
bitter
here
ends
in
sleep
that
is
sweeter
than
tasks
most
noble
there
is
not
any
book
or
face
of
dearest
look
that
i
would
not
turn
from
now
to
go
into
the
unknown
i
must
enter
and
leave
alone
i
know
not
how
the
tall
forest
towers
its
cloudy
foliage
lowers
ahead
shelf
above
shelf
its
silence
i
hear
and
obey
that
i
may
lose
my
way
and
myself
out
of
the
wood
of
thoughts
that
grows
by
night
to
be
cut
down
by
the
sharp
axe
of
light
out
of
the
night
two
cocks
together
crow
cleaving
the
darkness
with
a
silver
blow
and
bright
before
my
eyes
twin
trumpeters
stand
heralds
of
splendour
one
at
either
hand
each
facing
each
as
in
a
coat
of
arms
the
milkers
lace
their
boots
up
at
the
farms
words
out
of
us
all
that
make
rhymes
will
you
choose
sometimes
as
the
winds
use
a
crack
in
a
wall
or
a
drain
their
joy
or
their
pain
to
whistle
through
choose
me
you
english
words
i
know
you
you
are
light
as
dreams
tough
as
oak
precious
as
gold
as
poppies
and
corn
or
an
old
cloak
sweet
as
our
birds
to
the
ear
as
the
burnet
rose
in
the
heat
of
midsummer
strange
as
the
races
of
dead
and
unborn
strange
and
sweet
equally
and
familiar
to
the
eye
as
the
dearest
faces
that
a
man
knows
and
as
lost
homes
are
but
though
older
far
than
oldest
yew
as
our
hills
are
worn
new
again
and
again
young
as
our
streams
after
rain
and
as
dear
as
the
earth
which
you
prove
that
we
love
make
me
content
with
some
sweetness
from
wales
whose
nightingales
have
no
wings
from
wiltshire
and
kent
and
herefordshire
and
the
villages
there
from
the
names
and
the
things
no
less
let
me
sometimes
dance
with
you
or
climb
or
stand
perchance
in
ecstasy
fixed
and
free
in
a
rhyme
as
poets
do
the
end
printed
at
the
chapel
