i
in
petersburg
in
the
a
surprising
event
occurred
an
officer
of
the
cuirassier
life
guards
a
handsome
prince
who
everyone
predicted
would
become
to
the
emperor
nicholas
i
and
have
a
brilliant
career
left
the
service
broke
off
his
engagement
to
a
beautiful
maid
of
honour
a
favourite
of
the
empress
s
gave
his
small
estate
to
his
sister
and
retired
to
a
monastery
to
become
a
monk
this
event
appeared
extraordinary
and
inexplicable
to
those
who
did
not
know
his
inner
motives
but
for
prince
stepan
kasatsky
himself
it
all
occurred
so
naturally
that
he
could
not
imagine
how
he
could
have
acted
otherwise
his
father
a
retired
colonel
of
the
guards
had
died
when
stepan
was
twelve
and
sorry
as
his
mother
was
to
part
from
her
son
she
entered
him
at
the
military
college
as
her
deceased
husband
had
intended
the
widow
herself
with
her
daughter
varvara
moved
to
petersburg
to
be
near
her
son
and
have
him
with
her
for
the
holidays
the
boy
was
distinguished
both
by
his
brilliant
ability
and
by
his
immense
he
was
first
both
in
his
studies
especially
in
mathematics
of
which
he
was
particularly
fond
and
also
in
drill
and
in
riding
though
of
more
than
average
height
he
was
handsome
and
agile
and
he
would
have
been
an
altogether
exemplary
cadet
had
it
not
been
for
his
quick
temper
he
was
remarkably
truthful
and
was
neither
dissipated
nor
addicted
to
drink
the
only
faults
that
marred
his
conduct
were
fits
of
fury
to
which
he
was
subject
and
during
which
he
lost
control
of
himself
and
became
like
a
wild
animal
he
once
nearly
threw
out
of
the
window
another
cadet
who
had
begun
to
tease
him
about
his
collection
of
minerals
on
another
occasion
he
came
almost
completely
to
grief
by
flinging
a
whole
dish
of
cutlets
at
an
officer
who
was
acting
as
steward
attacking
him
and
it
was
said
striking
him
for
having
broken
his
word
and
told
a
barefaced
lie
he
would
certainly
have
been
reduced
to
the
ranks
had
not
the
director
of
the
college
hushed
up
the
whole
matter
and
dismissed
the
steward
by
the
time
he
was
eighteen
he
had
finished
his
college
course
and
received
a
commission
as
lieutenant
in
an
aristocratic
regiment
of
the
guards
the
emperor
nicholas
pavlovich
nicholas
i
had
noticed
him
while
he
was
still
at
the
college
and
continued
to
take
notice
of
him
in
the
regiment
and
it
was
on
this
account
that
people
predicted
for
him
an
appointment
as
to
the
emperor
kasatsky
himself
strongly
desired
it
not
from
ambition
only
but
chiefly
because
since
his
cadet
days
he
had
been
passionately
devoted
to
nicholas
pavlovich
the
emperor
had
often
visited
the
military
college
and
every
time
kasatsky
saw
that
tall
erect
figure
with
breast
expanded
in
its
military
overcoat
entering
with
brisk
step
saw
the
cropped
the
moustache
the
aquiline
nose
and
heard
the
sonorous
voice
exchanging
greetings
with
the
cadets
he
was
seized
by
the
same
rapture
that
he
experienced
later
on
when
he
met
the
woman
he
loved
indeed
his
passionate
adoration
of
the
emperor
was
even
stronger
he
wished
to
sacrifice
something
everything
even
himself
to
prove
his
complete
devotion
and
the
emperor
nicholas
was
conscious
of
evoking
this
rapture
and
deliberately
aroused
it
he
played
with
the
cadets
surrounded
himself
with
them
treating
them
sometimes
with
childish
simplicity
sometimes
as
a
friend
and
then
again
with
majestic
solemnity
after
that
affair
with
the
officer
nicholas
pavlovich
said
nothing
to
kasatsky
but
when
the
latter
approached
he
waved
him
away
theatrically
frowned
shook
his
finger
at
him
and
afterwards
when
leaving
said
remember
that
i
know
everything
there
are
some
things
i
would
rather
not
know
but
they
remain
here
and
he
pointed
to
his
heart
when
on
leaving
college
the
cadets
were
received
by
the
emperor
he
did
not
again
refer
to
kasatsky
s
offence
but
told
them
all
as
was
his
custom
that
they
should
serve
him
and
the
fatherland
loyally
that
he
would
always
be
their
best
friend
and
that
when
necessary
they
might
approach
him
direct
all
the
cadets
were
as
usual
greatly
moved
and
kasatsky
even
shed
tears
remembering
the
past
and
vowed
that
he
would
serve
his
beloved
tsar
with
all
his
soul
when
kasatsky
took
up
his
commission
his
mother
moved
with
her
daughter
first
to
moscow
and
then
to
their
country
estate
kasatsky
gave
half
his
property
to
his
sister
and
kept
only
enough
to
maintain
himself
in
the
expensive
regiment
he
had
joined
to
all
appearance
he
was
just
an
ordinary
brilliant
young
officer
of
the
guards
making
a
career
for
himself
but
intense
and
complex
strivings
went
on
within
him
from
early
childhood
his
efforts
had
seemed
to
be
very
varied
but
essentially
they
were
all
one
and
the
same
he
tried
in
everything
he
took
up
to
attain
such
success
and
perfection
as
would
evoke
praise
and
surprise
whether
it
was
his
studies
or
his
military
exercises
he
took
them
up
and
worked
at
them
till
he
was
praised
and
held
up
as
an
example
to
others
mastering
one
subject
he
took
up
another
and
obtained
first
place
in
his
studies
for
example
while
still
at
college
he
noticed
in
himself
an
awkwardness
in
french
conversation
and
contrived
to
master
french
till
he
spoke
it
as
well
as
russian
and
then
he
took
up
chess
and
became
an
excellent
player
apart
from
his
main
vocation
which
was
the
service
of
his
tsar
and
the
fatherland
he
always
set
himself
some
particular
aim
and
however
unimportant
it
was
devoted
himself
completely
to
it
and
lived
for
it
until
it
was
accomplished
and
as
soon
as
it
was
attained
another
aim
would
immediately
present
itself
replacing
its
predecessor
this
passion
for
distinguishing
himself
or
for
accomplishing
something
in
order
to
distinguish
himself
filled
his
life
on
taking
up
his
commission
he
set
himself
to
acquire
the
utmost
perfection
in
knowledge
of
the
service
and
very
soon
became
a
model
officer
though
still
with
the
same
fault
of
ungovernable
irascibility
which
here
in
the
service
again
led
him
to
commit
actions
inimical
to
his
success
then
he
took
to
reading
having
once
in
conversation
in
society
felt
himself
deficient
in
general
education
and
again
achieved
his
purpose
then
wishing
to
secure
a
brilliant
position
in
high
society
he
learnt
to
dance
excellently
and
very
soon
was
invited
to
all
the
balls
in
the
best
circles
and
to
some
of
their
evening
gatherings
but
this
did
not
satisfy
him
he
was
accustomed
to
being
first
and
in
this
society
was
far
from
being
so
the
highest
society
then
consisted
and
i
think
always
consist
of
four
sorts
of
people
rich
people
who
are
received
at
court
people
not
wealthy
but
born
and
brought
up
in
court
circles
rich
people
who
ingratiate
themselves
into
the
court
set
and
people
neither
rich
nor
belonging
to
the
court
but
who
ingratiate
themselves
into
the
first
and
second
sets
kasatsky
did
not
belong
to
the
first
two
sets
but
was
readily
welcomed
in
the
others
on
entering
society
he
determined
to
have
relations
with
some
society
lady
and
to
his
own
surprise
quickly
accomplished
this
purpose
he
soon
realized
however
that
the
circles
in
which
he
moved
were
not
the
highest
and
that
though
he
was
received
in
the
highest
spheres
he
did
not
belong
to
them
they
were
polite
to
him
but
showed
by
their
whole
manner
that
they
had
their
own
set
and
that
he
was
not
of
it
and
kasatsky
wished
to
belong
to
that
inner
circle
to
attain
that
end
it
would
be
necessary
to
be
an
to
the
emperor
which
he
expected
to
become
or
to
marry
into
that
exclusive
set
which
he
resolved
to
do
and
his
choice
fell
on
a
beauty
belonging
to
the
court
who
not
merely
belonged
to
the
circle
into
which
he
wished
to
be
accepted
but
whose
friendship
was
coveted
by
the
very
highest
people
and
those
most
firmly
established
in
that
highest
circle
this
was
countess
korotkova
kasatsky
began
to
pay
court
to
her
and
not
merely
for
the
sake
of
his
career
she
was
extremely
attractive
and
he
soon
fell
in
love
with
her
at
first
she
was
noticeably
cool
towards
him
but
then
suddenly
changed
and
became
gracious
and
her
mother
gave
him
pressing
invitations
to
visit
them
kasatsky
proposed
and
was
accepted
he
was
surprised
at
the
facility
with
which
he
attained
such
happiness
but
though
he
noticed
something
strange
and
unusual
in
the
behaviour
towards
him
of
both
mother
and
daughter
he
was
blinded
by
being
so
deeply
in
love
and
did
not
realize
what
almost
the
whole
town
knew
namely
that
his
fiancee
had
been
the
emperor
nicholas
s
mistress
the
previous
year
two
weeks
before
the
day
arranged
for
the
wedding
kasatsky
was
at
tsarskoe
selo
at
his
fiancee
s
country
place
it
was
a
hot
day
in
may
he
and
his
betrothed
had
walked
about
the
garden
and
were
sitting
on
a
bench
in
a
shady
linden
alley
mary
s
white
muslin
dress
suited
her
particularly
well
and
she
seemed
the
personification
of
innocence
and
love
as
she
sat
now
bending
her
head
now
gazing
up
at
the
very
tall
and
handsome
man
who
was
speaking
to
her
with
particular
tenderness
and
as
if
he
feared
by
word
or
gesture
to
offend
or
sully
her
angelic
purity
kasatsky
belonged
to
those
men
of
the
they
are
now
no
longer
to
be
found
who
while
deliberately
and
without
any
conscientious
scruples
condoning
impurity
in
themselves
required
ideal
and
angelic
purity
in
their
women
regarded
all
unmarried
women
of
their
circle
as
possessed
of
such
purity
and
treated
them
accordingly
there
was
much
that
was
false
and
harmful
in
this
outlook
as
concerning
the
laxity
the
men
permitted
themselves
but
in
regard
to
the
women
that
view
sharply
differing
from
that
held
by
young
people
who
see
in
every
girl
merely
a
female
seeking
a
mate
was
i
think
of
value
the
girls
perceiving
such
adoration
endeavoured
with
more
or
less
success
to
be
goddesses
such
was
the
view
kasatsky
held
of
women
and
that
was
how
he
regarded
his
fiancee
he
was
particularly
in
love
that
day
but
did
not
experience
any
sensual
desire
for
her
on
the
contrary
he
regarded
her
with
tender
adoration
as
something
unattainable
he
rose
to
his
full
height
standing
before
her
with
both
hands
on
his
sabre
i
have
only
now
realized
what
happiness
a
man
can
experience
and
it
is
you
my
darling
who
have
given
me
this
happiness
he
said
with
a
timid
smile
endearments
had
not
yet
become
usual
between
them
and
feeling
himself
morally
inferior
he
felt
terrified
at
this
stage
to
use
them
to
such
an
angel
it
is
thanks
to
you
that
i
have
come
to
know
myself
i
have
learnt
that
i
am
better
than
i
i
have
known
that
for
a
long
time
that
was
why
i
began
to
love
nightingales
trilled
near
by
and
the
fresh
leafage
rustled
moved
by
a
passing
breeze
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
and
tears
came
into
his
eyes
she
understood
that
he
was
thanking
her
for
having
said
she
loved
him
he
silently
took
a
few
steps
up
and
down
and
then
approached
her
again
and
sat
down
you
know
i
have
to
tell
you
i
was
not
disinterested
when
i
began
to
make
love
to
you
i
wanted
to
get
into
society
but
later
how
unimportant
that
became
in
comparison
with
you
when
i
got
to
know
you
you
are
not
angry
with
me
for
that
she
did
not
reply
but
merely
touched
his
hand
he
understood
that
this
meant
no
i
am
not
you
said
he
hesitated
it
seemed
too
bold
to
say
you
said
that
you
began
to
love
me
i
believe
it
but
there
is
something
that
troubles
you
and
checks
your
feeling
what
is
it
yes
now
or
never
thought
she
he
is
bound
to
know
of
it
anyway
but
now
he
will
not
forsake
me
ah
if
he
should
it
would
be
terrible
and
she
threw
a
loving
glance
at
his
tall
noble
powerful
figure
she
loved
him
now
more
than
she
had
loved
the
tsar
and
apart
from
the
imperial
dignity
would
not
have
preferred
the
emperor
to
him
listen
i
can
not
deceive
you
i
have
to
tell
you
you
ask
what
it
is
it
is
that
i
have
loved
she
again
laid
her
hand
on
his
with
an
imploring
gesture
he
was
silent
you
want
to
know
who
it
was
it
was
the
we
all
love
him
i
can
imagine
you
a
schoolgirl
at
the
institute
no
it
was
later
i
was
infatuated
but
it
passed
i
must
tell
you
well
what
of
it
no
it
was
not
simply
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
what
you
gave
yourself
to
him
she
was
silent
his
mistress
she
did
not
answer
he
sprang
up
and
stood
before
her
with
trembling
jaws
pale
as
death
he
now
remembered
how
the
emperor
meeting
him
on
the
nevsky
had
amiably
congratulated
him
o
god
what
have
i
done
stiva
don
t
touch
me
don
t
touch
me
oh
how
it
pains
he
turned
away
and
went
to
the
house
there
he
met
her
mother
what
is
the
matter
prince
i
she
became
silent
on
seeing
his
face
the
blood
had
suddenly
rushed
to
his
head
you
knew
it
and
used
me
to
shield
them
if
you
weren
t
a
woman
he
cried
lifting
his
enormous
fist
and
turning
aside
he
ran
away
had
his
fiancee
s
lover
been
a
private
person
he
would
have
killed
him
but
it
was
his
beloved
tsar
next
day
he
applied
both
for
furlough
and
his
discharge
and
professing
to
be
ill
so
as
to
see
no
one
he
went
away
to
the
country
he
spent
the
summer
at
his
village
arranging
his
affairs
when
summer
was
over
he
did
not
return
to
petersburg
but
entered
a
monastery
and
there
became
a
monk
his
mother
wrote
to
try
to
dissuade
him
from
this
decisive
step
but
he
replied
that
he
felt
god
s
call
which
transcended
all
other
considerations
only
his
sister
who
was
as
proud
and
ambitious
as
he
understood
him
she
understood
that
he
had
become
a
monk
in
order
to
be
above
those
who
considered
themselves
his
superiors
and
she
understood
him
correctly
by
becoming
a
monk
he
showed
contempt
for
all
that
seemed
most
important
to
others
and
had
seemed
so
to
him
while
he
was
in
the
service
and
he
now
ascended
a
height
from
which
he
could
look
down
on
those
he
had
formerly
envied
but
it
was
not
this
alone
as
his
sister
varvara
supposed
that
influenced
him
there
was
also
in
him
something
else
a
sincere
religious
feeling
which
varvara
did
not
know
which
intertwined
itself
with
the
feeling
of
pride
and
the
desire
for
and
guided
him
his
disillusionment
with
mary
whom
he
had
thought
of
angelic
purity
and
his
sense
of
injury
were
so
strong
that
they
brought
him
to
despair
and
the
despair
led
him
to
what
to
god
to
his
childhood
s
faith
which
had
never
been
destroyed
in
him
ii
kasatsky
entered
the
monastery
on
the
feast
of
the
intercession
of
the
blessed
virgin
the
abbot
of
that
monastery
was
a
gentleman
by
birth
a
learned
writer
and
a
starets
that
is
he
belonged
to
that
succession
of
monks
originating
in
walachia
who
each
choose
a
director
and
teacher
whom
they
implicitly
obey
this
superior
had
been
a
disciple
of
the
starets
ambrose
who
was
a
disciple
of
makarius
who
was
a
disciple
of
the
starets
leonid
who
was
a
disciple
of
paussy
velichkovsky
to
this
abbot
kasatsky
submitted
himself
as
to
his
chosen
director
here
in
the
monastery
besides
the
feeling
of
ascendency
over
others
that
such
a
life
gave
him
he
felt
much
as
he
had
done
in
the
world
he
found
satisfaction
in
attaining
the
greatest
possible
perfection
outwardly
as
well
as
inwardly
as
in
the
regiment
he
had
been
not
merely
an
irreproachable
officer
but
had
even
exceeded
his
duties
and
widened
the
borders
of
perfection
so
also
as
a
monk
he
tried
to
be
perfect
and
was
always
industrious
abstemious
submissive
and
meek
as
well
as
pure
both
in
deed
and
in
thought
and
obedient
this
last
quality
in
particular
made
life
far
easier
for
him
if
many
of
the
demands
of
life
in
the
monastery
which
was
near
the
capital
and
much
frequented
did
not
please
him
and
were
temptations
to
him
they
were
all
nullified
by
obedience
it
is
not
for
me
to
reason
my
business
is
to
do
the
task
set
me
whether
it
be
standing
beside
the
relics
singing
in
the
choir
or
making
up
accounts
in
the
monastery
all
possibility
of
doubt
about
anything
was
silenced
by
obedience
to
the
starets
had
it
not
been
for
this
he
would
have
been
oppressed
by
the
length
and
monotony
of
the
church
services
the
bustle
of
the
many
visitors
and
the
bad
qualities
of
the
other
monks
as
it
was
he
not
only
bore
it
all
joyfully
but
found
in
it
solace
and
support
i
don
t
know
why
it
is
necessary
to
hear
the
same
prayers
several
times
a
day
but
i
know
that
it
is
necessary
and
knowing
this
i
find
joy
in
his
director
told
him
that
as
material
food
is
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
the
life
of
the
body
so
spiritual
food
the
church
prayers
is
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
the
spiritual
life
he
believed
this
and
though
the
church
services
for
which
he
had
to
get
up
early
in
the
morning
were
a
difficulty
they
certainly
calmed
him
and
gave
him
joy
this
was
the
result
of
his
consciousness
of
humility
and
the
certainty
that
whatever
he
had
to
do
being
fixed
by
the
starets
was
right
the
interest
of
his
life
consisted
not
only
in
an
ever
greater
and
greater
subjugation
of
his
will
but
in
the
attainment
of
all
the
christian
virtues
which
at
first
seemed
to
him
easily
attainable
he
had
given
his
whole
estate
to
his
sister
and
did
not
regret
it
he
had
no
personal
claims
humility
towards
his
inferiors
was
not
merely
easy
for
him
but
afforded
him
pleasure
even
victory
over
the
sins
of
the
flesh
greed
and
lust
was
easily
attained
his
director
had
specially
warned
him
against
the
latter
sin
but
kasatsky
felt
free
from
it
and
was
glad
one
thing
only
tormented
him
the
remembrance
of
his
fiancee
and
not
merely
the
remembrance
but
the
vivid
image
of
what
might
have
been
involuntarily
he
recalled
a
lady
he
knew
who
had
been
a
favourite
of
the
emperor
s
but
had
afterwards
married
and
become
an
admirable
wife
and
mother
the
husband
had
a
high
position
influence
and
honour
and
a
good
and
penitent
wife
in
his
better
hours
kasatsky
was
not
disturbed
by
such
thoughts
and
when
he
recalled
them
at
such
times
he
was
merely
glad
to
feel
that
the
temptation
was
past
but
there
were
moments
when
all
that
made
up
his
present
life
suddenly
grew
dim
before
him
moments
when
if
he
did
not
cease
to
believe
in
the
aims
he
had
set
himself
he
ceased
to
see
them
and
could
evoke
no
confidence
in
them
but
was
seized
by
a
remembrance
of
and
terrible
to
say
a
regret
for
the
change
of
life
he
had
made
the
only
thing
that
saved
him
in
that
state
of
mind
was
obedience
and
work
and
the
fact
that
the
whole
day
was
occupied
by
prayer
he
went
through
the
usual
forms
of
prayer
he
bowed
in
prayer
he
even
prayed
more
than
usual
but
it
was
only
and
his
soul
was
not
in
it
this
condition
would
continue
for
a
day
or
sometimes
for
two
days
and
would
then
pass
of
itself
but
those
days
were
dreadful
kasatsky
felt
that
he
was
neither
in
his
own
hands
nor
in
god
s
but
was
subject
to
something
else
all
he
could
do
then
was
to
obey
the
starets
to
restrain
himself
to
undertake
nothing
and
simply
to
wait
in
general
all
this
time
he
lived
not
by
his
own
will
but
by
that
of
the
starets
and
in
this
obedience
he
found
a
special
tranquillity
so
he
lived
in
his
first
monastery
for
seven
years
at
the
end
of
the
third
year
he
received
the
tonsure
and
was
ordained
to
the
priesthood
by
the
name
of
sergius
the
profession
was
an
important
event
in
his
inner
life
he
had
previously
experienced
a
great
consolation
and
spiritual
exaltation
when
receiving
communion
and
now
when
he
himself
officiated
the
performance
of
the
preparation
filled
him
with
ecstatic
and
deep
emotion
but
subsequently
that
feeling
became
more
and
more
deadened
and
once
when
he
was
officiating
in
a
depressed
state
of
mind
he
felt
that
the
influence
produced
on
him
by
the
service
would
not
endure
and
it
did
in
fact
weaken
till
only
the
habit
remained
in
general
in
the
seventh
year
of
his
life
in
the
monastery
sergius
grew
weary
he
had
learnt
all
there
was
to
learn
and
had
attained
all
there
was
to
attain
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
and
his
spiritual
drowsiness
increased
during
this
time
he
heard
of
his
mother
s
death
and
his
sister
varvara
s
marriage
but
both
events
were
matters
of
indifference
to
him
his
whole
attention
and
his
whole
interest
were
concentrated
on
his
inner
life
in
the
fourth
year
of
his
priesthood
during
which
the
bishop
had
been
particularly
kind
to
him
the
starets
told
him
that
he
ought
not
to
decline
it
if
he
were
offered
an
appointment
to
higher
duties
then
monastic
ambition
the
very
thing
he
had
found
so
repulsive
in
other
monks
arose
within
him
he
was
assigned
to
a
monastery
near
the
metropolis
he
wished
to
refuse
but
the
starets
ordered
him
to
accept
the
appointment
he
did
so
and
took
leave
of
the
starets
and
moved
to
the
other
monastery
the
exchange
into
the
metropolitan
monastery
was
an
important
event
in
sergius
s
life
there
he
encountered
many
temptations
and
his
whole
was
concentrated
on
meeting
them
in
the
first
monastery
women
had
not
been
a
temptation
to
him
but
here
that
temptation
arose
with
terrible
strength
and
even
took
definite
shape
there
was
a
lady
known
for
her
frivolous
behaviour
who
began
to
seek
his
favour
she
talked
to
him
and
asked
him
to
visit
her
sergius
sternly
declined
but
was
horrified
by
the
definiteness
of
his
desire
he
was
so
alarmed
that
he
wrote
about
it
to
the
starets
and
in
addition
to
keep
himself
in
hand
he
spoke
to
a
young
novice
and
conquering
his
sense
of
shame
confessed
his
weakness
to
him
asking
him
to
keep
watch
on
him
and
not
let
him
go
anywhere
except
to
service
and
to
fulfil
his
duties
besides
this
a
great
pitfall
for
sergius
lay
in
the
fact
of
his
extreme
antipathy
to
his
new
abbot
a
cunning
worldly
man
who
was
making
a
career
for
himself
in
the
church
struggle
with
himself
as
he
might
he
could
not
master
that
feeling
he
was
submissive
to
the
abbot
but
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
he
never
ceased
to
condemn
him
and
in
the
second
year
of
his
residence
at
the
new
monastery
that
broke
out
the
vigil
service
was
being
performed
in
the
large
church
on
the
eve
of
the
feast
of
the
intercession
of
the
blessed
virgin
and
there
were
many
visitors
the
abbot
himself
was
conducting
the
service
father
sergius
was
standing
in
his
usual
place
and
praying
that
is
he
was
in
that
condition
of
struggle
which
always
occupied
him
during
the
service
especially
in
the
large
church
when
he
was
not
himself
conducting
the
service
this
conflict
was
occasioned
by
his
irritation
at
the
presence
of
fine
folk
especially
ladies
he
tried
not
to
see
them
or
to
notice
all
that
went
on
how
a
soldier
conducted
them
pushing
the
common
people
aside
how
the
ladies
pointed
out
the
monks
to
one
another
especially
himself
and
a
monk
noted
for
his
good
looks
he
tried
as
it
were
to
keep
his
mind
in
blinkers
to
see
nothing
but
the
light
of
the
candles
on
the
the
icons
and
those
conducting
the
service
he
tried
to
hear
nothing
but
the
prayers
that
were
being
chanted
or
read
to
feel
nothing
but
in
consciousness
of
the
fulfilment
of
duty
a
feeling
he
always
experienced
when
hearing
or
reciting
in
advance
the
prayers
he
had
so
often
heard
so
he
stood
crossing
and
prostrating
himself
when
necessary
and
struggled
with
himself
now
giving
way
to
cold
condemnation
and
now
to
a
consciously
evoked
obliteration
of
thought
and
feeling
then
the
sacristan
father
nicodemus
also
a
great
to
sergius
who
involuntarily
reproached
him
for
flattering
and
fawning
on
the
abbot
approached
him
and
bowing
low
requested
his
presence
behind
the
holy
gates
father
sergius
straightened
his
mantle
put
on
his
biretta
and
went
circumspectly
through
the
crowd
lise
regarde
a
droite
c
est
lui
he
heard
a
woman
s
voice
say
ou
ou
il
n
est
pas
tellement
he
knew
that
they
were
speaking
of
him
he
heard
them
and
as
always
at
moments
of
temptation
he
repeated
the
words
lead
us
not
into
temptation
and
bowing
his
head
and
lowering
his
eyes
went
past
the
ambo
and
in
by
the
north
door
avoiding
the
canons
in
their
cassocks
who
were
just
then
passing
the
on
entering
the
sanctuary
he
bowed
crossing
himself
as
usual
and
bending
double
before
the
icons
then
raising
his
head
but
without
turning
he
glanced
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
at
the
abbot
whom
he
saw
standing
beside
another
glittering
figure
the
abbot
was
standing
by
the
wall
in
his
vestments
having
freed
his
short
plump
hands
from
beneath
his
chasuble
he
had
folded
them
over
his
fat
body
and
protruding
stomach
and
fingering
the
cords
of
his
vestments
was
smilingly
saying
something
to
a
military
man
in
the
uniform
of
a
general
of
the
imperial
suite
with
its
insignia
and
which
father
sergius
s
experienced
eye
at
once
recognized
this
general
had
been
the
commander
of
the
regiment
in
which
sergius
had
served
he
now
evidently
occupied
an
important
position
and
father
sergius
at
once
noticed
that
the
abbot
was
aware
of
this
and
that
his
red
face
and
bald
head
beamed
with
satisfaction
and
pleasure
this
vexed
and
disgusted
father
sergius
the
more
so
when
he
heard
that
the
abbot
had
only
sent
for
him
to
satisfy
the
general
s
curiosity
to
see
a
man
who
had
formerly
served
with
him
as
he
expressed
it
very
pleased
to
see
you
in
your
angelic
guise
said
the
general
holding
out
his
hand
i
hope
you
have
not
forgotten
an
old
the
whole
thing
the
abbot
s
red
smiling
face
amid
its
fringe
of
grey
the
general
s
words
his
face
with
its
smile
and
the
smell
of
wine
from
his
breath
and
of
cigars
from
his
whiskers
revolted
father
sergius
he
bowed
again
to
the
abbot
and
said
your
reverence
deigned
to
send
for
me
and
stopped
the
whole
expression
of
his
face
and
eyes
asking
why
yes
to
meet
the
general
replied
the
abbot
your
reverence
i
left
the
world
to
save
myself
from
temptation
said
father
sergius
turning
pale
and
with
quivering
lips
why
do
you
expose
me
to
it
during
prayers
and
in
god
s
house
you
may
go
go
said
the
abbot
flaring
up
and
frowning
next
day
father
sergius
asked
pardon
of
the
abbot
and
of
the
brethren
for
his
pride
but
at
the
same
time
after
a
night
spent
in
prayer
he
decided
that
he
must
leave
this
monastery
and
he
wrote
to
the
starets
begging
permission
to
return
to
him
he
wrote
that
he
felt
his
weakness
and
incapacity
to
struggle
against
temptation
without
his
help
and
penitently
confessed
his
sin
of
pride
by
return
of
post
came
a
letter
from
the
starets
who
wrote
that
sergius
s
pride
was
the
cause
of
all
that
had
happened
the
old
man
pointed
out
that
his
fits
of
anger
were
due
to
the
fact
that
in
refusing
all
clerical
honours
he
humiliated
himself
not
for
the
sake
of
god
but
for
the
sake
of
his
pride
there
now
am
i
not
a
splendid
man
not
to
want
anything
that
was
why
he
could
not
tolerate
the
abbot
s
action
i
have
renounced
everything
for
the
glory
of
god
and
here
i
am
exhibited
like
a
wild
beast
had
you
renounced
vanity
for
god
s
sake
you
would
have
borne
it
worldly
pride
is
not
yet
dead
in
you
i
have
thought
about
you
sergius
my
son
and
prayed
also
and
this
is
what
god
has
suggested
to
me
at
the
tambov
hermitage
the
anchorite
hilary
a
man
of
saintly
life
has
died
he
had
lived
there
eighteen
years
the
tambov
abbot
is
asking
whether
there
is
not
a
brother
who
would
take
his
place
and
here
comes
your
letter
go
to
father
paissy
of
the
tambov
monastery
i
will
write
to
him
about
you
and
you
must
ask
for
hilary
s
cell
not
that
you
can
replace
hilary
but
you
need
solitude
to
quell
your
pride
may
god
bless
you
sergius
obeyed
the
starets
showed
his
letter
to
the
abbot
and
having
obtained
his
permission
gave
up
his
cell
handed
all
his
possessions
over
to
the
monastery
and
set
out
for
the
tambov
hermitage
there
the
abbot
an
excellent
manager
of
merchant
origin
received
sergius
simply
and
quietly
and
placed
him
in
hilary
s
cell
at
first
assigning
to
him
a
lay
brother
but
afterwards
leaving
him
alone
at
sergius
s
own
request
the
cell
was
a
dual
cave
dug
into
the
hillside
and
in
it
hilary
had
been
buried
in
the
back
part
was
hilary
s
grave
while
in
the
front
was
a
niche
for
sleeping
with
a
straw
mattress
a
small
table
and
a
shelf
with
icons
and
books
outside
the
outer
door
which
fastened
with
a
hook
was
another
shelf
on
which
once
a
day
a
monk
placed
food
from
the
monastery
and
so
sergius
became
a
hermit
iii
at
carnival
time
in
the
sixth
year
of
sergius
s
life
at
the
hermitage
a
merry
company
of
rich
people
men
and
women
from
a
neighbouring
town
made
up
a

of

a
young
girl
and
the
fourth
a
divorcee
beautiful
rich
and
eccentric
who
amazed
and
shocked
the
town
by
her
escapades
the
weather
was
excellent
and
the
road
smooth
as
a
floor
they
drove
some
seven
miles
out
of
town
and
then
stopped
and
consulted
as
to
whether
they
should
turn

and
sweets
for
themselves
the
ladies
wrapped
up
in
their
white
dogskins
the
drivers
disputed
as
to
whose
troyka
should
go
ahead
and
the
youngest
seating
himself
sideways
with
a
dashing
air
swung
his
long
knout
and
shouted
to
the
horses
the
tinkled
and
the
squeaked
over
the
snow
the
sledge
swayed
hardly
at
all
the
with
his
tightly
bound
tail
under
his
decorated
breechband
galloped
smoothly
and
briskly
the
smooth
road
seemed
to
run
rapidly
backwards
while
the
driver
dashingly
shook
the
reins
one
of
the
lawyers
and
the
officer
sitting
opposite
talked
nonsense
to
makovkina
s
neighbour
but
makovkina
herself
sat
motionless
and
in
thought
tightly
wrapped
in
her
fur
always
the
same
and
always
nasty
the
same
red
shiny
faces
smelling
of
wine
and
cigars
the
same
talk
the
same
thoughts
and
always
about
the
same
things
and
they
are
all
satisfied
and
confident
that
it
should
be
so
and
will
go
on
living
like
that
till
they
die
but
i
can
t
it
bores
me
i
want
something
that
would
upset
it
all
and
turn
it
upside
down
suppose
it
happened
to
us
as
to
those
people
at
saratov
was
it
who
kept
on
driving
and
froze
to
death
what
would
our
people
do
how
would
they
behave
basely
for
certain
each
for
himself
and
i
too
should
act
badly
but
i
at
any
rate
have
beauty
they
all
know
it
and
how
about
that
monk
is
it
possible
that
he
has
become
indifferent
to
it
no
that
is
the
one
thing
they
all
care
for
like
that
cadet
last
autumn
what
a
fool
he
was
ivan
nikolaevich
she
said
aloud
what
are
your
commands
how
old
is
he
who
over
forty
i
should
and
does
he
receive
all
visitors
yes
everybody
but
not
cover
up
my
feet
not
like
that
how
clumsy
you
are
no
more
more
like
that
but
you
need
not
squeeze
them
so
they
came
to
the
forest
where
the
cell
was
makovkina
got
out
of
the
sledge
and
told
them
to
drive
on
they
tried
to
dissuade
her
but
she
grew
irritable
and
ordered
them
to
go
on
when
the
sledges
had
gone
she
went
up
the
path
in
her
white
dogskin
coat
the
lawyer
got
out
and
stopped
to
watch
her
it
was
father
sergius
s
sixth
year
as
a
recluse
and
he
was
now
his
life
in
solitude
was
hard
not
on
account
of
the
fasts
and
the
prayers
they
were
no
hardship
to
him
but
on
account
of
an
inner
conflict
he
had
not
at
all
anticipated
the
sources
of
that
conflict
were
two
doubts
and
the
lust
of
the
flesh
and
these
two
enemies
always
appeared
together
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
were
two
foes
but
in
reality
they
were
one
and
the
same
as
soon
as
doubt
was
gone
so
was
the
lustful
desire
but
thinking
them
to
be
two
different
fiends
he
fought
them
separately
o
my
god
my
god
thought
he
why
dost
thou
not
grant
me
faith
there
is
lust
of
course
even
the
saints
had
to
fight
that
saint
anthony
and
others
but
they
had
faith
while
i
have
moments
hours
and
days
when
it
is
absent
why
does
the
whole
world
with
all
its
delights
exist
if
it
is
sinful
and
must
be
renounced
why
hast
thou
created
this
temptation
temptation
is
it
not
rather
a
temptation
that
i
wish
to
abandon
all
the
joys
of
earth
and
prepare
something
for
myself
there
where
perhaps
there
is
nothing
and
he
became
horrified
and
filled
with
disgust
at
himself
vile
creature
and
it
is
you
who
wish
to
become
a
saint
he
upbraided
himself
and
he
began
to
pray
but
as
soon
as
he
started
to
pray
he
saw
himself
vividly
as
he
had
been
at
the
monastery
in
a
majestic
post
in
biretta
and
mantle
and
he
shook
his
head
no
that
is
not
right
it
is
deception
i
may
deceive
others
but
not
myself
or
god
i
am
not
a
majestic
man
but
a
pitiable
and
ridiculous
one
and
he
threw
back
the
folds
of
his
cassock
and
smiled
as
he
looked
at
his
thin
legs
in
their
underclothing
then
he
dropped
the
folds
of
the
cassock
again
and
began
reading
the
prayers
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
prostrating
himself
can
it
be
that
this
couch
will
be
my
bier
he
read
and
it
seemed
as
if
a
devil
whispered
to
him
a
solitary
couch
is
itself
a
bier
falsehood
and
in
imagination
he
saw
the
shoulders
of
a
widow
with
whom
he
had
lived
he
shook
himself
and
went
on
reading
having
read
the
precepts
he
took
up
the
gospels
opened
the
book
and
happened
on
a
passage
he
often
repeated
and
knew
by
heart
lord
i
believe
help
thou
my
unbelief
and
he
put
away
all
the
doubts
that
had
arisen
as
one
replaces
an
object
of
insecure
equilibrium
so
he
carefully
replaced
his
belief
on
its
shaky
pedestal
and
carefully
stepped
back
from
it
so
as
not
to
shake
or
upset
it
the
blinkers
were
adjusted
again
and
he
felt
tranquillized
and
repeating
his
childhood
s
prayer
lord
receive
me
receive
me
he
felt
not
merely
at
ease
but
thrilled
and
joyful
he
crossed
himself
and
lay
down
on
the
bedding
on
his
narrow
bench
tucking
his
summer
cassock
under
his
head
he
fell
asleep
at
once
and
in
his
light
slumber
he
seemed
to
hear
the
tinkling
of
sledge
bells
he
did
not
know
whether
he
was
dreaming
or
awake
but
a
knock
at
the
door
aroused
him
he
sat
up
distrusting
his
senses
but
the
knock
was
repeated
yes
it
was
a
knock
close
at
hand
at
his
door
and
with
it
the
sound
of
a
woman
s
voice
my
god
can
it
be
true
as
i
have
read
in
the
lives
of
the
saints
that
the
devil
takes
on
the
form
of
a
woman
yes
it
is
a
woman
s
voice
and
a
tender
timid
pleasant
voice
phui
and
he
spat
to
exorcise
the
devil
no
it
was
only
my
imagination
he
assured
himself
and
he
went
to
the
corner
where
his
lectern
stood
falling
on
his
knees
in
the
regular
and
habitual
manner
which
of
itself
gave
him
consolation
and
satisfaction
he
sank
down
his
hair
hanging
over
his
face
and
pressed
his
head
already
going
bald
in
front
to
the
cold
damp
strip
of
drugget
on
the
draughty
floor
he
read
the
psalm
old
father
pimon
had
told
him
warded
off
temptation
he
easily
raised
his
light
and
emaciated
body
on
his
strong
sinewy
legs
and
tried
to
continue
saying
his
prayers
but
instead
of
doing
so
he
involuntarily
strained
his
hearing
he
wished
to
hear
more
all
was
quiet
from
the
corner
of
the
roof
regular
drops
continued
to
fall
into
the
tub
below
outside
was
a
mist
and
fog
eating
into
the
snow
that
lay
on
the
ground
it
was
still
very
still
and
suddenly
there
was
a
rustling
at
the
window
and
a
voice
that
same
tender
timid
voice
which
could
only
belong
to
an
attractive
woman
said
let
me
in
for
christ
s
sake
it
seemed
as
though
his
blood
had
all
rushed
to
his
heart
and
settled
there
he
could
hardly
breathe
let
god
arise
and
let
his
enemies
be
scattered
but
i
am
not
a
devil
it
was
obvious
that
the
lips
that
uttered
this
were
smiling
i
am
not
a
devil
but
only
a
sinful
woman
who
has
lost
her
way
not
figuratively
but
literally
she
laughed
i
am
frozen
and
beg
for
he
pressed
his
face
to
the
window
but
the
little
was
reflected
by
it
and
shone
on
the
whole
pane
he
put
his
hands
to
both
sides
of
his
face
and
peered
between
them
fog
mist
a
tree
and
just
opposite
him
she
herself
yes
there
a
few
inches
from
him
was
the
sweet
kindly
frightened
face
of
a
woman
in
a
cap
and
a
coat
of
long
white
fur
leaning
towards
him
their
eyes
met
with
instant
recognition
not
that
they
had
ever
known
one
another
they
had
never
met
before
but
by
the
look
they
exchanged
they
and
he
particularly
felt
that
they
knew
and
understood
one
another
after
that
glance
to
imagine
her
to
be
a
devil
and
not
a
simple
kindly
sweet
timid
woman
was
impossible
who
are
you
why
have
you
come
he
asked
do
please
open
the
door
she
replied
with
capricious
authority
i
am
frozen
i
tell
you
i
have
lost
my
but
i
am
a
monk
a
oh
do
please
open
the
door
or
do
you
wish
me
to
freeze
under
your
window
while
you
say
your
prayers
but
how
have
you
i
shan
t
eat
you
for
god
s
sake
let
me
in
i
am
quite
she
really
did
feel
afraid
and
said
this
in
an
almost
tearful
voice
he
stepped
back
from
the
window
and
looked
at
an
icon
of
the
saviour
in
his
crown
of
thorns
lord
help
me
lord
help
me
he
exclaimed
crossing
himself
and
bowing
low
then
he
went
to
the
door
and
opening
it
into
the
tiny
porch
felt
for
the
hook
that
fastened
the
outer
door
and
began
to
lift
it
he
heard
steps
outside
she
was
coming
from
the
window
to
the
door
ah
she
suddenly
exclaimed
and
he
understood
that
she
had
stepped
into
the
puddle
that
the
dripping
from
the
roof
had
formed
at
the
threshold
his
hands
trembled
and
he
could
not
raise
the
hook
of
the
tightly
closed
door
oh
what
are
you
doing
let
me
in
i
am
all
wet
i
am
frozen
you
are
thinking
about
saving
your
soul
and
are
letting
me
freeze
to
death
he
jerked
the
door
towards
him
raised
the
hook
and
without
considering
what
he
was
doing
pushed
it
open
with
such
force
that
it
struck
her
oh
pardon
he
suddenly
exclaimed
reverting
completely
to
his
old
manner
with
ladies
she
smiled
on
hearing
that
pardon
he
is
not
quite
so
terrible
after
all
she
thought
it
s
all
right
it
is
you
who
must
pardon
me
she
said
stepping
past
him
i
should
never
have
ventured
but
such
an
extraordinary
circumstance
if
you
please
he
uttered
and
stood
aside
to
let
her
pass
him
a
strong
smell
of
fine
scent
which
he
had
long
not
encountered
struck
him
she
went
through
the
little
porch
into
the
cell
where
he
lived
he
closed
the
outer
door
without
fastening
the
hook
and
stepped
in
after
her
lord
jesus
christ
son
of
god
have
mercy
on
me
a
sinner
lord
have
mercy
on
me
a
sinner
he
prayed
unceasingly
not
merely
to
himself
but
involuntarily
moving
his
lips
if
you
please
he
said
to
her
again
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
moisture
dripping
from
her
to
the
floor
as
she
looked
him
over
her
eyes
were
laughing
forgive
me
for
having
disturbed
your
solitude
but
you
see
what
a
position
i
am
in
it
all
came
about
from
our
starting
from
town
for
a
and
my
making
a
bet
that
i
would
walk
back
by
myself
from
the
vorobevka
to
the
town
but
then
i
lost
my
way
and
if
i
had
not
happened
to
come
upon
your
cell
she
began
lying
but
his
face
confused
her
so
that
she
could
not
continue
but
became
silent
she
had
not
expected
him
to
be
at
all
such
as
he
was
he
was
not
as
handsome
as
she
had
imagined
but
was
nevertheless
beautiful
in
her
eyes
his
greyish
hair
and
beard
slightly
curling
his
fine
regular
nose
and
his
eyes
like
glowing
coal
when
he
looked
at
her
made
a
strong
impression
on
her
he
saw
that
she
was
lying
yes
so
said
he
looking
at
her
and
again
lowering
his
eyes
i
will
go
in
there
and
this
place
is
at
your
and
taking
down
the
little
lamp
he
lit
a
candle
and
bowing
low
to
her
went
into
the
small
cell
beyond
the
partition
and
she
heard
him
begin
to
move
something
about
there
probably
he
is
barricading
himself
in
from
me
she
thought
with
a
smile
and
throwing
off
her
white
dogskin
cloak
she
tried
to
take
off
her
cap
which
had
become
entangled
in
her
hair
and
in
the
woven
kerchief
she
was
wearing
under
it
she
had
not
got
at
all
wet
when
standing
under
the
window
and
had
said
so
only
as
a
pretext
to
get
him
to
let
her
in
but
she
really
had
stepped
into
the
puddle
at
the
door
and
her
left
foot
was
wet
up
to
the
ankle
and
her
overshoe
full
of
water
she
sat
down
on
his
bed
a
bench
only
covered
by
a
bit
of
carpet
and
began
to
take
off
her
boots
the
little
cell
seemed
to
her
charming
the
narrow
little
room
some
seven
feet
by
nine
was
as
clean
as
glass
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
the
bench
on
which
she
was
sitting
the
above
it
and
a
lectern
in
the
corner
a
sheepskin
coat
and
a
cassock
hung
on
nails
by
the
door
above
the
lectern
was
the
little
lamp
and
an
icon
of
christ
in
his
crown
of
thorns
the
room
smelt
strangely
of
perspiration
and
of
earth
it
all
pleased
her
even
that
smell
her
wet
feet
especially
one
of
them
were
uncomfortable
and
she
quickly
began
to
take
off
her
boots
and
stockings
without
ceasing
to
smile
pleased
not
so
much
at
having
achieved
her
object
as
because
she
perceived
that
she
had
abashed
that
charming
strange
striking
and
attractive
man
he
did
not
respond
but
what
of
that
she
said
to
herself
father
sergius
father
sergius
or
how
does
one
call
you
what
do
you
want
replied
a
quiet
voice
please
forgive
me
for
disturbing
your
solitude
but
really
i
could
not
help
it
i
should
simply
have
fallen
and
i
don
t
know
that
i
shan
t
now
i
am
all
wet
and
my
feet
are
like
pardon
me
replied
the
quiet
voice
i
can
not
be
of
any
assistance
to
i
would
not
have
disturbed
you
if
i
could
have
helped
it
i
am
only
here
till
he
did
not
reply
and
she
heard
him
muttering
something
probably
his
prayers
you
will
not
be
coming
in
here
she
asked
smiling
for
i
must
undress
to
dry
he
did
not
reply
but
continued
to
read
his
prayers
yes
that
is
a
man
thought
she
getting
her
dripping
boot
off
with
difficulty
she
tugged
at
it
but
could
not
get
it
off
the
absurdity
of
it
struck
her
and
she
began
to
laugh
almost
inaudibly
but
knowing
that
he
would
hear
her
laughter
and
would
be
moved
by
it
just
as
she
wished
him
to
be
she
laughed
louder
and
her
laughter
gay
natural
and
kindly
really
acted
on
him
just
in
the
way
she
wished
yes
i
could
love
a
man
like
that
such
eyes
and
such
a
simple
noble
face
and
passionate
too
despite
all
the
prayers
he
mutters
thought
she
you
can
t
deceive
a
woman
in
these
things
as
soon
as
he
put
his
face
to
the
window
and
saw
me
he
understood
and
knew
the
glimmer
of
it
was
in
his
eyes
and
remained
there
he
began
to
love
me
and
desired
me
yes
desired
said
she
getting
her
overshoe
and
her
boot
off
at
last
and
starting
to
take
off
her
stockings
to
remove
those
long
stockings
fastened
with
elastic
it
was
necessary
to
raise
her
skirts
she
felt
embarrassed
and
said
don
t
come
in
but
there
was
no
reply
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
the
steady
muttering
continued
and
also
a
sound
of
moving
he
is
prostrating
himself
to
the
ground
no
doubt
thought
she
but
he
won
t
bow
himself
out
of
it
he
is
thinking
of
me
just
as
i
am
thinking
of
him
he
is
thinking
of
these
feet
of
mine
with
the
same
feeling
that
i
have
and
she
pulled
off
her
wet
stockings
and
put
her
feet
up
on
the
bench
pressing
them
under
her
she
sat
a
while
like
that
with
her
arms
round
her
knees
and
looking
pensively
before
her
but
it
is
a
desert
here
in
this
silence
no
one
would
ever
know
she
rose
took
her
stockings
over
to
the
stove
and
hung
them
on
the
damper
it
was
a
queer
damper
and
she
turned
it
about
and
then
stepping
lightly
on
her
bare
feet
returned
to
the
bench
and
sat
down
there
again
with
her
feet
up
there
was
complete
silence
on
the
other
side
of
the
partition
she
looked
at
the
tiny
watch
that
hung
round
her
neck
it
was
two
o
clock
our
party
should
return
about
three
she
had
not
more
than
an
hour
before
her
well
am
i
to
sit
like
this
all
alone
what
nonsense
i
don
t
want
to
i
will
call
him
at
father
sergius
father
sergius
sergey
dmitrich
prince
kasatsky
beyond
the
partition
all
was
silent
listen
this
is
cruel
i
would
not
call
you
if
it
were
not
necessary
i
am
ill
i
don
t
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
she
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
suffering
oh
oh
she
groaned
falling
back
on
the
bench
and
strange
to
say
she
really
felt
that
her
strength
was
failing
that
she
was
becoming
faint
that
everything
in
her
ached
and
that
she
was
shivering
with
fever
listen
help
me
i
don
t
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
oh
oh
she
unfastened
her
dress
exposing
her
breast
and
lifted
her
arms
bare
to
the
elbow
oh
oh
all
this
time
he
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
partition
and
prayed
having
finished
all
the
evening
prayers
he
now
stood
motionless
his
eyes
looking
at
the
end
of
his
nose
and
mentally
repeated
with
all
his
soul
lord
jesus
christ
son
of
god
have
mercy
upon
me
but
he
had
heard
everything
he
had
heard
how
the
silk
rustled
when
she
took
off
her
dress
how
she
stepped
with
bare
feet
on
the
floor
and
had
heard
how
she
rubbed
her
feet
with
her
hand
he
felt
his
own
weakness
and
that
he
might
be
lost
at
any
moment
that
was
why
he
prayed
unceasingly
he
felt
rather
as
the
hero
in
the
must
have
felt
when
he
had
to
go
on
and
on
without
looking
round
so
sergius
heard
and
felt
that
danger
and
destruction
were
there
hovering
above
and
around
him
and
that
he
could
only
save
himself
by
not
looking
in
that
direction
for
an
instant
but
suddenly
the
desire
to
look
seized
him
at
the
same
instant
she
said
this
is
inhuman
i
may
die
yes
i
will
go
to
her
but
like
the
saint
who
laid
one
hand
on
the
adulteress
and
thrust
his
other
into
the
brazier
but
there
is
no
brazier
he
looked
round
the
lamp
he
put
his
finger
over
the
flame
and
frowned
preparing
himself
to
suffer
and
for
a
rather
long
time
as
it
seemed
to
him
there
was
no
sensation
but
suddenly
he
had
not
yet
decided
whether
it
was
painful
enough
he
writhed
all
over
jerked
his
hand
away
and
waved
it
in
the
air
no
i
can
t
stand
that
for
god
s
sake
come
to
me
i
am
dying
oh
well
shall
i
perish
no
not
so
i
will
come
to
you
directly
he
said
and
having
opened
his
door
he
went
without
looking
at
her
through
the
cell
into
the
porch
where
he
used
to
chop
wood
there
he
felt
for
the
block
and
for
an
axe
which
leant
against
the
wall
immediately
he
said
and
taking
up
the
axe
with
his
right
hand
he
laid
the
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
on
the
block
swung
the
axe
and
struck
with
it
below
the
second
joint
the
finger
flew
off
more
lightly
than
a
stick
of
similar
thickness
and
bounding
up
turned
over
on
the
edge
of
the
block
and
then
fell
to
the
floor
he
heard
it
fall
before
he
felt
any
pain
but
before
he
had
time
to
be
surprised
he
felt
a
burning
pain
and
the
warmth
of
flowing
blood
he
hastily
wrapped
the
stump
in
the
skirt
of
his
cassock
and
pressing
it
to
his
hip
went
back
into
the
room
and
standing
in
front
of
the
woman
lowered
his
eyes
and
asked
in
a
low
voice
what
do
you
want
she
looked
at
his
pale
face
and
his
quivering
left
cheek
and
suddenly
felt
ashamed
she
jumped
up
seized
her
fur
cloak
and
throwing
it
round
her
shoulders
wrapped
herself
up
in
it
i
was
in
pain
i
have
caught
cold
i
father
sergius
i
he
let
his
eyes
shining
with
a
quiet
light
of
joy
rest
upon
her
and
said
dear
sister
why
did
you
wish
to
ruin
your
immortal
soul
temptations
must
come
into
the
world
but
woe
to
him
by
whom
temptation
comes
pray
that
god
may
forgive
us
she
listened
and
looked
at
him
suddenly
she
heard
the
sound
of
something
dripping
she
looked
down
and
saw
that
blood
was
flowing
from
his
hand
and
down
his
cassock
what
have
you
done
to
your
hand
she
remembered
the
sound
she
had
heard
and
seizing
the
little
lamp
ran
out
into
the
porch
there
on
the
floor
she
saw
the
bloody
finger
she
returned
with
her
face
paler
than
his
and
was
about
to
speak
to
him
but
he
silently
passed
into
the
back
cell
and
fastened
the
door
forgive
me
she
said
how
can
i
atone
for
my
sin
go
let
me
tie
up
your
go
away
from
she
dressed
hurriedly
and
silently
and
when
ready
sat
waiting
in
her
furs
the
were
heard
outside
father
sergius
forgive
me
go
away
god
will
father
sergius
i
will
change
my
life
do
not
forsake
me
go
forgive
me
and
give
me
your
blessing
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
she
heard
his
voice
from
behind
the
partition
go
she
burst
into
sobs
and
left
the
cell
the
lawyer
came
forward
to
meet
her
well
i
see
i
have
lost
the
bet
it
can
t
be
helped
where
will
you
sit
it
is
all
the
same
to
she
took
a
seat
in
the
sledge
and
did
not
utter
a
word
all
the
way
home
a
year
later
she
entered
a
convent
as
a
novice
and
lived
a
strict
life
under
the
direction
of
the
hermit
arseny
who
wrote
letters
to
her
at
long
intervals
iv
father
sergius
lived
as
a
recluse
for
another
seven
years
at
first
he
accepted
much
of
what
people
brought
him
tea
sugar
white
bread
milk
clothing
and
but
as
time
went
on
he
led
a
more
and
more
austere
life
refusing
everything
superfluous
and
finally
he
accepted
nothing
but
once
a
week
everything
else
that
was
brought
to
him
he
gave
to
the
poor
who
came
to
him
he
spent
his
entire
time
in
his
cell
in
prayer
or
in
conversation
with
callers
who
became
more
and
more
numerous
as
time
went
on
only
three
times
a
year
did
he
go
out
to
church
and
when
necessary
he
went
out
to
fetch
water
and
wood
the
episode
with
makovkina
had
occurred
after
five
years
of
his
hermit
life
that
occurrence
soon
became
generally
known
her
nocturnal
visit
the
change
she
underwent
and
her
entry
into
a
convent
from
that
time
father
sergius
s
fame
increased
more
and
more
visitors
came
to
see
him
other
monks
settled
down
near
his
cell
and
a
church
was
erected
there
and
also
a
hostelry
his
fame
as
usual
exaggerating
his
feats
spread
ever
more
and
more
widely
people
began
to
come
to
him
from
a
distance
and
began
bringing
invalids
to
him
whom
they
declared
he
cured
his
first
cure
occurred
in
the
eighth
year
of
his
life
as
a
hermit
it
was
the
healing
of
a
boy
whose
mother
brought
him
to
father
sergius
insisting
that
he
should
lay
his
hand
on
the
child
s
head
it
had
never
occurred
to
father
sergius
that
he
could
cure
the
sick
he
would
have
regarded
such
a
thought
as
a
great
sin
of
pride
but
the
mother
who
brought
the
boy
implored
him
insistently
falling
at
his
feet
and
saying
why
do
you
who
heal
others
refuse
to
help
my
son
she
besought
him
in
christ
s
name
when
father
sergius
assured
her
that
only
god
could
heal
the
sick
she
replied
that
she
only
wanted
him
to
lay
his
hands
on
the
boy
and
pray
for
him
father
sergius
refused
and
returned
to
his
cell
but
next
day
it
was
in
autumn
and
the
nights
were
already
cold
on
going
out
for
water
he
saw
the
same
mother
with
her
son
a
pale
boy
of
fourteen
and
was
met
by
the
same
petition
he
remembered
the
parable
of
the
unjust
judge
and
though
he
had
previously
felt
sure
that
he
ought
to
refuse
he
now
began
to
hesitate
and
having
hesitated
took
to
prayer
and
prayed
until
a
decision
formed
itself
in
his
soul
this
decision
was
that
he
ought
to
accede
to
the
woman
s
request
and
that
her
faith
might
save
her
son
as
for
himself
he
would
in
this
case
be
but
an
insignificant
instrument
chosen
by
god
and
going
out
to
the
mother
he
did
what
she
asked
laid
his
hand
on
the
boy
s
head
and
prayed
the
mother
left
with
her
son
and
a
month
later
the
boy
recovered
and
the
fame
of
the
holy
healing
power
of
the
starets
sergius
as
they
now
called
him
spread
throughout
the
whole
district
after
that
not
a
week
passed
without
sick
people
coming
riding
or
on
foot
to
father
sergius
and
having
acceded
to
one
petition
he
could
not
refuse
others
and
he
laid
his
hands
on
many
and
prayed
many
recovered
and
his
fame
spread
more
and
more
so
seven
years
passed
in
the
monastery
and
thirteen
in
his
hermit
s
cell
he
now
had
the
appearance
of
an
old
man
his
beard
was
long
and
grey
but
his
hair
though
thin
was
still
black
and
curly
v
for
some
weeks
father
sergius
had
been
living
with
one
persistent
thought
whether
he
was
right
in
accepting
the
position
in
which
he
had
not
so
much
placed
himself
as
been
placed
by
the
archimandrite
and
the
abbot
that
position
had
begun
after
the
recovery
of
the
boy
from
that
time
with
each
month
week
and
day
that
passed
sergius
felt
his
own
inner
life
wasting
away
and
being
replaced
by
external
life
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
turned
inside
out
sergius
saw
that
he
was
a
means
of
attracting
visitors
and
contributions
to
the
monastery
and
that
therefore
the
authorities
arranged
matters
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
as
much
use
of
him
as
possible
for
instance
they
rendered
it
impossible
for
him
to
do
any
manual
work
he
was
supplied
with
everything
he
could
want
and
they
only
demanded
of
him
that
he
should
not
refuse
his
blessing
to
those
who
came
to
seek
it
for
his
convenience
they
appointed
days
when
he
would
receive
they
arranged
a
for
men
and
a
place
was
railed
in
so
that
he
should
not
be
pushed
over
by
the
crowds
of
women
visitors
and
so
that
he
could
conveniently
bless
those
who
came
they
told
him
that
people
needed
him
and
that
fulfilling
christ
s
law
of
love
he
could
not
refuse
their
demand
to
see
him
and
that
to
avoid
them
would
be
cruel
he
could
not
but
agree
with
this
but
the
more
he
gave
himself
up
to
such
a
life
the
more
he
felt
that
what
was
internal
became
external
and
that
the
fount
of
living
water
within
him
dried
up
and
that
what
he
did
now
was
done
more
and
more
for
men
and
less
and
less
for
god
whether
he
admonished
people
or
simply
blessed
them
or
prayed
for
the
sick
or
advised
people
about
their
lives
or
listened
to
expressions
of
gratitude
from
those
he
had
helped
by
precepts
or
alms
or
healing
as
they
assured
him
he
could
not
help
being
pleased
at
it
and
could
not
be
indifferent
to
the
results
of
his
activity
and
to
the
influence
he
exerted
he
thought
himself
a
shining
light
and
the
more
he
felt
this
the
more
was
he
conscious
of
a
weakening
a
dying
down
of
the
divine
light
of
truth
that
shone
within
him
in
how
far
is
what
i
do
for
god
and
in
how
far
is
it
for
men
that
was
the
question
that
insistently
tormented
him
and
to
which
he
was
not
so
much
unable
to
give
himself
an
answer
as
unable
to
face
the
answer
in
the
depth
of
his
soul
he
felt
that
the
devil
had
substituted
an
activity
for
men
in
place
of
his
former
activity
for
god
he
felt
this
because
just
as
it
had
formerly
been
hard
for
him
to
be
torn
from
his
solitude
so
now
that
solitude
itself
was
hard
for
him
he
was
oppressed
and
wearied
by
visitors
but
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
was
glad
of
their
presence
and
glad
of
the
praise
they
heaped
upon
him
there
was
a
time
when
he
decided
to
go
away
and
hide
he
even
planned
all
that
was
necessary
for
that
purpose
he
prepared
for
himself
a
peasant
s
shirt
trousers
coat
and
cap
he
explained
that
he
wanted
these
to
give
to
those
who
asked
and
he
kept
these
clothes
in
his
cell
planning
how
he
would
put
them
on
cut
his
hair
short
and
go
away
first
he
would
go
some
three
hundred
versts
by
train
then
he
would
leave
the
train
and
walk
from
village
to
village
he
asked
an
old
man
who
had
been
a
soldier
how
he
tramped
what
people
gave
him
and
what
shelter
they
allowed
him
the
soldier
told
him
where
people
were
most
charitable
and
where
they
would
take
a
wanderer
in
for
the
night
and
father
sergius
intended
to
avail
himself
of
this
information
he
even
put
on
those
clothes
one
night
in
his
desire
to
go
but
he
could
not
decide
what
was
best
to
remain
or
to
escape
at
first
he
was
in
doubt
but
afterwards
this
indecision
passed
he
submitted
to
custom
and
yielded
to
the
devil
and
only
the
peasant
garb
reminded
him
of
the
thought
and
feeling
he
had
had
every
day
more
and
more
people
flocked
to
him
and
less
and
less
time
was
left
him
for
prayer
and
for
renewing
his
spiritual
strength
sometimes
in
lucid
moments
he
thought
he
was
like
a
place
where
there
had
once
been
a
spring
there
used
to
be
a
feeble
spring
of
living
water
which
flowed
quietly
from
me
and
through
me
that
was
true
life
the
time
when
she
tempted
me
he
always
thought
with
ecstasy
of
that
night
and
of
her
who
was
now
mother
agnes
she
had
tasted
of
that
pure
water
but
since
then
there
had
not
been
time
for
it
to
collect
before
thirsty
people
came
crowding
in
and
pushing
one
another
aside
and
they
had
trampled
everything
down
and
nothing
was
left
but
mud
so
he
thought
in
rare
moments
of
lucidity
but
his
usual
state
of
mind
was
one
of
weariness
and
a
tender
pity
for
himself
because
of
that
weariness
it
was
in
spring
on
the
eve
of
the
feast
father
sergius
was
officiating
at
the
vigil
service
in
his
hermitage
church
where
the
congregation
was
as
large
as
the
little
church
could
hold
about
twenty
people
they
were
all
proprietors
or
merchants
father
sergius
admitted
anyone
but
a
selection
was
made
by
the
monk
in
attendance
and
by
an
assistant
who
was
sent
to
the
hermitage
every
day
from
the
monastery
a
crowd
of
some
eighty
people
pilgrims
and
peasants
and
especially
stood
outside
waiting
for
father
sergius
to
come
out
and
bless
them
meanwhile
he
conducted
the
service
but
at
the
point
at
which
he
went
out
to
the
tomb
of
his
predecessor
he
staggered
and
would
have
fallen
had
he
not
been
caught
by
a
merchant
standing
behind
him
and
by
the
monk
acting
as
deacon
what
is
the
matter
father
sergius
dear
man
o
lord
exclaimed
the
women
he
is
as
white
as
a
sheet
but
father
sergius
recovered
immediately
and
though
very
pale
he
waved
the
merchant
and
the
deacon
aside
and
continued
to
chant
the
service
father
seraphim
the
deacon
the
acolytes
and
sofya
ivanovna
a
lady
who
always
lived
near
the
hermitage
and
tended
father
sergius
begged
him
to
bring
the
service
to
an
end
no
there
s
nothing
the
matter
said
father
sergius
slightly
smiling
from
beneath
his
moustache
and
continuing
the
service
yes
that
is
the
way
the
saints
behave
thought
he
a
holy
man
an
angel
of
god
he
heard
just
then
the
voice
of
sofya
ivanovna
behind
him
and
also
of
the
merchant
who
had
supported
him
he
did
not
heed
their
entreaties
but
went
on
with
the
service
again
crowding
together
they
all
made
their
way
by
the
narrow
passages
back
into
the
little
church
and
there
though
abbreviating
it
slightly
father
sergius
completed
vespers
immediately
after
the
service
father
sergius
having
pronounced
the
benediction
on
those
present
went
over
to
the
bench
under
the
elm
tree
at
the
entrance
to
the
cave
he
wished
to
rest
and
breathe
the
fresh
air
he
felt
in
need
of
it
but
as
soon
as
he
left
the
church
the
crowd
of
people
rushed
to
him
soliciting
his
blessing
his
advice
and
his
help
there
were
pilgrims
who
constantly
tramped
from
one
holy
place
to
another
and
from
one
starets
to
another
and
were
always
entranced
by
every
shrine
and
every
starets
father
sergius
knew
this
common
cold
conventional
and
most
irreligious
type
there
were
pilgrims
for
the
most
part
discharged
soldiers
unaccustomed
to
a
settled
life
and
many
of
them
drunken
old
men
who
tramped
from
monastery
to
monastery
merely
to
be
fed
and
there
were
rough
peasants
and
who
had
come
with
their
selfish
requirements
seeking
cures
or
to
have
doubts
about
quite
practical
affairs
solved
for
them
about
marrying
off
a
daughter
or
hiring
a
shop
or
buying
a
bit
of
land
or
how
to
atone
for
having
overlaid
a
child
or
having
an
illegitimate
one
all
this
was
an
old
story
and
not
in
the
least
interesting
to
him
he
knew
he
would
hear
nothing
new
from
these
folk
that
they
would
arouse
no
religious
emotion
in
him
but
he
liked
to
see
the
crowd
to
which
his
blessing
and
advice
was
necessary
and
precious
so
while
that
crowd
oppressed
him
it
also
pleased
him
father
seraphim
began
to
drive
them
away
saying
that
father
sergius
was
tired
but
father
sergius
remembering
the
words
of
the
gospel
forbid
them
children
not
to
come
unto
me
and
feeling
tenderly
towards
himself
at
this
recollection
said
they
should
be
allowed
to
approach
he
rose
went
to
the
railing
beyond
which
the
crowd
had
gathered
and
began
blessing
them
and
answering
their
questions
but
in
a
voice
so
weak
that
he
was
touched
with
pity
for
himself
yet
despite
his
wish
to
receive
them
all
he
could
not
do
it
things
again
grew
dark
before
his
eyes
and
he
staggered
and
grasped
the
railings
he
felt
a
rush
of
blood
to
his
head
and
first
went
pale
and
then
suddenly
flushed
i
must
leave
the
rest
till
i
can
not
do
more
and
pronouncing
a
general
benediction
he
returned
to
the
bench
the
merchant
again
supported
him
and
leading
him
by
the
arm
helped
him
to
be
seated
father
came
voices
from
the
crowd
dear
father
do
not
forsake
us
without
you
we
are
lost
the
merchant
having
seated
father
sergius
on
the
bench
under
the
elm
took
on
himself
police
duties
and
drove
the
people
off
very
resolutely
it
is
true
that
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
so
that
father
sergius
might
not
hear
him
but
his
words
were
incisive
and
angry
be
off
be
off
he
has
blessed
you
and
what
more
do
you
want
get
along
with
you
or
i
ll
wring
your
necks
move
on
there
get
along
you
old
woman
with
your
dirty
go
go
where
are
you
shoving
to
you
ve
been
told
that
it
is
finished
will
be
as
god
wills
but
for
he
has
finished
father
only
let
my
eyes
have
a
glimpse
of
his
dear
face
said
an
old
woman
i
ll
glimpse
you
where
are
you
shoving
to
father
sergius
noticed
that
the
merchant
seemed
to
be
acting
roughly
and
in
a
feeble
voice
told
the
attendant
that
the
people
should
not
be
driven
away
he
knew
that
they
would
be
driven
away
all
the
same
and
he
much
desired
to
be
left
alone
and
to
rest
but
he
sent
the
attendant
with
that
message
to
produce
an
impression
all
right
all
right
i
am
not
driving
them
away
i
am
only
remonstrating
with
them
replied
the
merchant
you
know
they
wouldn
t
hesitate
to
drive
a
man
to
death
they
have
no
pity
they
only
consider
themselves
you
ve
been
told
you
can
not
see
him
go
away
and
he
got
rid
of
them
all
he
took
all
these
pains
because
he
liked
order
and
liked
to
domineer
and
drive
the
people
away
but
chiefly
because
he
wanted
to
have
father
sergius
to
himself
he
was
a
widower
with
an
only
daughter
who
was
an
invalid
and
unmarried
and
whom
he
had
brought
fourteen
hundred
versts
to
father
sergius
to
be
healed
for
two
years
past
he
had
been
taking
her
to
different
places
to
be
cured
first
to
the
university
clinic
in
the
chief
town
of
the
province
but
that
did
no
good
then
to
a
peasant
in
the
province
of
samara
where
she
got
a
little
better
then
to
a
doctor
in
moscow
to
whom
he
paid
much
money
but
this
did
no
good
at
all
now
he
had
been
told
that
father
sergius
wrought
cures
and
had
brought
her
to
him
so
when
all
the
people
had
been
driven
away
he
approached
father
sergius
and
suddenly
falling
on
his
knees
loudly
exclaimed
holy
father
bless
my
afflicted
offspring
that
she
may
be
healed
of
her
malady
i
venture
to
prostrate
myself
at
your
holy
and
he
placed
one
hand
on
the
other
he
said
and
did
all
this
as
if
he
were
doing
something
clearly
and
firmly
appointed
by
law
and
usage
as
if
one
must
and
should
ask
for
a
daughter
to
be
cured
in
just
this
way
and
no
other
he
did
it
with
such
conviction
that
it
seemed
even
to
father
sergius
that
it
should
be
said
and
done
in
just
that
way
but
nevertheless
he
bade
him
rise
and
tell
him
what
the
trouble
was
the
merchant
said
that
his
daughter
a
girl
of
had
fallen
ill
two
years
ago
after
her
mother
s
sudden
death
she
had
moaned
as
he
expressed
it
and
since
then
had
not
been
herself
and
now
he
had
brought
her
fourteen
hundred
versts
and
she
was
waiting
in
the
hostelry
till
father
sergius
should
give
orders
to
bring
her
she
did
not
go
out
during
the
day
being
afraid
of
the
light
and
could
only
come
after
sunset
is
she
very
weak
asked
father
sergius
no
she
has
no
particular
weakness
she
is
quite
plump
and
is
only
nerastenic
the
doctors
say
if
you
will
only
let
me
bring
her
this
evening
father
sergius
i
ll
fly
like
a
spirit
to
fetch
her
holy
father
revive
a
parent
s
heart
restore
his
line
save
his
afflicted
daughter
by
your
prayers
and
the
merchant
again
threw
himself
on
his
knees
and
bending
sideways
with
his
head
resting
on
his
clenched
fists
remained
stock
still
father
sergius
again
told
him
to
get
up
and
thinking
how
heavy
his
activities
were
and
how
he
went
through
with
them
patiently
notwithstanding
he
sighed
heavily
and
after
a
few
seconds
of
silence
said
well
bring
her
this
evening
i
will
pray
for
her
but
now
i
am
tired
and
he
closed
his
eyes
i
will
send
for
the
merchant
went
away
stepping
on
tiptoe
which
only
made
his
boots
creak
the
louder
and
father
sergius
remained
alone
his
whole
life
was
filled
by
church
services
and
by
people
who
came
to
see
him
but
had
been
a
particularly
difficult
one
in
the
morning
an
important
official
had
arrived
and
had
had
a
long
conversation
with
him
after
that
a
lady
had
come
with
her
son
this
son
was
a
sceptical
young
professor
whom
the
mother
an
ardent
believer
and
devoted
to
father
sergius
had
brought
that
he
might
talk
to
him
the
conversation
had
been
very
trying
the
young
man
evidently
not
wishing
to
have
a
controversy
with
a
monk
had
agreed
with
him
in
everything
as
with
someone
who
was
mentally
inferior
father
sergius
saw
that
the
young
man
did
not
believe
but
yet
was
satisfied
tranquil
and
at
ease
and
the
memory
of
that
conversation
now
disquieted
him
have
something
to
eat
father
said
the
attendant
all
right
bring
me
the
attendant
went
to
a
hut
that
had
been
arranged
some
ten
paces
from
the
cave
and
father
sergius
remained
alone
the
time
was
long
past
when
he
had
lived
alone
doing
everything
for
himself
and
eating
only
or
rolls
prepared
for
the
church
he
had
been
advised
long
since
that
he
had
no
right
to
neglect
his
health
and
he
was
given
wholesome
though
lenten
food
he
ate
sparingly
though
much
more
than
he
had
done
and
often
he
ate
with
much
pleasure
and
not
as
formerly
with
aversion
and
a
sense
of
guilt
so
it
was
now
he
had
some
gruel
drank
a
cup
of
tea
and
ate
half
a
white
roll
the
attendant
went
away
and
father
sergius
remained
alone
under
the
elm
tree
it
was
a
wonderful
may
evening
when
the
birches
aspens
elms
wild
cherries
and
oaks
had
just
burst
into
foliage
the
bush
of
wild
cherries
behind
the
elm
tree
was
in
full
bloom
and
had
not
yet
begun
to
shed
its
blossoms
and
the
nightingales
one
quite
near
at
hand
and
two
or
three
others
in
the
bushes
down
by
the
river
burst
into
full
song
after
some
preliminary
twitters
from
the
river
came
the
songs
of
peasants
returning
no
doubt
from
their
work
the
sun
was
setting
behind
the
forest
its
last
rays
glowing
through
the
leaves
all
that
side
was
brilliant
green
the
other
side
with
the
elm
tree
was
dark
the
cockchafers
flew
clumsily
about
falling
to
the
ground
when
they
collided
with
anything
after
supper
father
sergius
began
to
repeat
a
silent
prayer
o
lord
jesus
christ
son
of
god
have
mercy
upon
us
and
then
he
read
a
psalm
and
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
the
psalm
a
sparrow
flew
out
from
the
bush
alighted
on
the
ground
and
hopped
towards
him
chirping
as
it
came
but
then
it
took
fright
at
something
and
flew
away
he
said
a
prayer
which
referred
to
his
abandonment
of
the
world
and
hastened
to
finish
it
in
order
to
send
for
the
merchant
with
the
sick
daughter
she
interested
him
in
that
she
presented
a
distraction
and
because
both
she
and
her
father
considered
him
a
saint
whose
prayers
were
efficacious
outwardly
he
disavowed
that
idea
but
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
he
considered
it
to
be
true
he
was
often
amazed
that
this
had
happened
that
he
stepan
kasatsky
had
come
to
be
such
an
extraordinary
saint
and
even
a
worker
of
miracles
but
of
the
fact
that
he
was
such
there
could
not
be
the
least
doubt
he
could
not
fail
to
believe
in
the
miracles
he
himself
witnessed
beginning
with
the
sick
boy
and
ending
with
the
old
woman
who
had
recovered
her
sight
when
he
had
prayed
for
her
strange
as
it
might
be
it
was
so
accordingly
the
merchant
s
daughter
interested
him
as
a
new
individual
who
had
faith
in
him
and
also
as
a
fresh
opportunity
to
confirm
his
healing
powers
and
enhance
his
fame
they
bring
people
a
thousand
versts
and
write
about
it
in
the
papers
the
emperor
knows
of
it
and
they
know
of
it
in
europe
in
unbelieving
europe
thought
he
and
suddenly
he
felt
ashamed
of
his
vanity
and
again
began
to
pray
lord
king
of
heaven
comforter
soul
of
truth
come
and
enter
into
me
and
cleanse
me
from
all
sin
and
save
and
bless
my
soul
cleanse
me
from
the
sin
of
worldly
vanity
that
troubles
me
he
repeated
and
he
remembered
how
often
he
had
prayed
about
this
and
how
vain
till
now
his
prayers
had
been
in
that
respect
his
prayers
worked
miracles
for
others
but
in
his
own
case
god
had
not
granted
him
liberation
from
this
petty
passion
he
remembered
his
prayers
at
the
commencement
of
his
life
at
the
hermitage
when
he
prayed
for
purity
humility
and
love
and
how
it
seemed
to
him
then
that
god
heard
his
prayers
he
had
retained
his
purity
and
had
chopped
off
his
finger
and
he
lifted
the
shrivelled
stump
of
that
finger
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
he
had
been
humble
then
when
he
had
always
seemed
loathsome
to
himself
on
account
of
his
sinfulness
and
when
he
remembered
the
tender
feelings
with
which
he
had
then
met
an
old
man
who
was
bringing
a
drunken
soldier
to
him
to
ask
alms
and
how
he
had
received
her
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
then
possessed
love
also
but
now
and
he
asked
himself
whether
he
loved
anyone
whether
he
loved
sofya
ivanovna
or
father
seraphim
whether
he
had
any
feeling
of
love
for
all
who
had
come
to
him
that
day
for
that
learned
young
man
with
whom
he
had
had
that
instructive
discussion
in
which
he
was
concerned
only
to
show
off
his
own
intelligence
and
that
he
had
not
lagged
behind
the
times
in
knowledge
he
wanted
and
needed
their
love
but
felt
none
towards
them
he
now
had
neither
love
nor
humility
nor
purity
he
was
pleased
to
know
that
the
merchant
s
daughter
was
and
he
wondered
whether
she
was
when
he
inquired
whether
she
was
weak
he
really
wanted
to
know
if
she
had
feminine
charm
can
i
have
fallen
so
low
he
thought
lord
help
me
restore
me
my
lord
and
god
and
he
clasped
his
hands
and
began
to
pray
the
nightingales
burst
into
song
a
cockchafer
knocked
against
him
and
crept
up
the
back
of
his
neck
he
brushed
it
off
but
does
he
exist
what
if
i
am
knocking
at
a
door
fastened
from
outside
the
bar
is
on
the
door
for
all
to
see
nature
the
nightingales
and
the
cockchafers
is
that
bar
perhaps
the
young
man
was
and
he
began
to
pray
aloud
he
prayed
for
a
long
time
till
these
thoughts
vanished
and
he
again
felt
calm
and
confident
he
rang
the
bell
and
told
the
attendant
to
say
that
the
merchant
might
bring
his
daughter
to
him
now
the
merchant
came
leading
his
daughter
by
the
arm
he
led
her
into
the
cell
and
immediately
left
her
she
was
a
very
fair
girl
plump
and
very
short
with
a
pale
frightened
childish
face
and
a
much
developed
feminine
figure
father
sergius
remained
seated
on
the
bench
at
the
entrance
and
when
she
was
passing
and
stopped
beside
him
for
his
blessing
he
was
aghast
at
himself
for
the
way
he
looked
at
her
figure
as
she
passed
by
him
he
was
acutely
conscious
of
her
femininity
though
he
saw
by
her
face
that
she
was
sensual
and
he
rose
and
went
into
the
cell
she
was
sitting
on
a
stool
waiting
for
him
and
when
he
entered
she
rose
i
want
to
go
back
to
papa
she
said
don
t
be
afraid
he
replied
what
are
you
suffering
from
i
am
in
pain
all
over
she
said
and
suddenly
her
face
lit
up
with
a
smile
you
will
be
well
said
he
pray
what
is
the
use
of
praying
i
have
prayed
and
it
does
no
good
and
she
continued
to
smile
i
want
you
to
pray
for
me
and
lay
your
hands
on
me
i
saw
you
in
a
how
did
you
see
me
i
saw
you
put
your
hands
on
my
breast
like
she
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
to
her
breast
just
he
yielded
his
right
hand
to
her
what
is
your
name
he
asked
trembling
all
over
and
feeling
that
he
was
overcome
and
that
his
desire
had
already
passed
beyond
control
marie
why
she
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
and
then
put
her
arm
round
his
waist
and
pressed
him
to
herself
what
are
you
doing
he
said
marie
you
are
a
devil
oh
perhaps
what
does
it
matter
and
embracing
him
she
sat
down
with
him
on
the
bed
at
dawn
he
went
out
into
the
porch
can
this
all
have
happened
her
father
will
come
and
she
will
tell
him
everything
she
is
a
devil
what
am
i
to
do
here
is
the
axe
with
which
i
chopped
off
my
he
snatched
up
the
axe
and
moved
back
towards
the
cell
the
attendant
came
up
do
you
want
some
wood
chopped
let
me
have
the
sergius
yielded
up
the
axe
and
entered
the
cell
she
was
lying
there
asleep
he
looked
at
her
with
horror
and
passed
on
beyond
the
partition
where
he
took
down
the
peasant
clothes
and
put
them
on
then
he
seized
a
pair
of
scissors
cut
off
his
long
hair
and
went
out
along
the
path
down
the
hill
to
the
river
where
he
had
not
been
for
more
than
three
years
a
road
ran
beside
the
river
and
he
went
along
it
and
walked
till
noon
then
he
went
into
a
field
of
rye
and
lay
down
there
towards
evening
he
approached
a
village
but
without
entering
it
went
towards
the
cliff
that
overhung
the
river
there
he
again
lay
down
to
rest
it
was
early
morning
half
an
hour
before
sunrise
all
was
damp
and
gloomy
and
a
cold
early
wind
was
blowing
from
the
west
yes
i
must
end
it
all
there
is
no
god
but
how
am
i
to
end
it
throw
myself
into
the
river
i
can
swim
and
should
not
drown
hang
myself
yes
just
throw
this
sash
over
a
this
seemed
so
feasible
and
so
easy
that
he
felt
horrified
as
usual
at
moments
of
despair
he
felt
the
need
of
prayer
but
there
was
no
one
to
pray
to
there
was
no
god
he
lay
down
resting
on
his
arm
and
suddenly
such
a
longing
for
sleep
overcame
him
that
he
could
no
longer
support
his
head
on
his
hand
but
stretched
out
his
arm
laid
his
head
upon
it
and
fell
asleep
but
that
sleep
lasted
only
for
a
moment
he
woke
up
immediately
and
began
not
to
dream
but
to
remember
he
saw
himself
as
a
child
in
his
mother
s
home
in
the
country
a
carriage
drives
up
and
out
of
it
steps
uncle
nicholas
sergeevich
with
his
long
black
beard
and
with
him
pashenka
a
thin
little
girl
with
large
mild
eyes
and
a
timid
pathetic
face
and
into
their
company
of
boys
pashenka
is
brought
and
they
have
to
play
with
her
but
it
is
dull
she
is
silly
and
it
ends
by
their
making
fun
of
her
and
forcing
her
to
show
how
she
can
swim
she
lies
down
on
the
floor
and
shows
them
and
they
all
laugh
and
make
a
fool
of
her
she
sees
this
and
blushes
red
in
patches
and
becomes
more
pitiable
than
before
so
pitiable
that
he
feels
ashamed
and
can
never
forget
that
crooked
kindly
submissive
smile
and
sergius
remembered
having
seen
her
since
then
long
after
just
before
he
became
a
monk
she
had
married
a
landowner
who
squandered
all
her
fortune
and
was
in
the
habit
of
beating
her
she
had
had
two
children
a
son
and
a
daughter
but
the
son
had
died
while
still
young
and
sergius
remembered
having
seen
her
very
wretched
then
again
he
had
seen
her
in
the
monastery
when
she
was
a
widow
she
had
been
still
the
same
not
exactly
stupid
but
insipid
insignificant
and
pitiable
she
had
come
with
her
daughter
and
her
daughter
s
fiance
they
were
already
poor
at
that
time
and
later
on
he
had
heard
that
she
was
living
in
a
small
provincial
town
and
was
very
poor
why
am
i
thinking
about
her
he
asked
himself
but
he
could
not
cease
doing
so
where
is
she
how
is
she
getting
on
is
she
still
as
unhappy
as
she
was
then
when
she
had
to
show
us
how
to
swim
on
the
floor
but
why
should
i
think
about
her
what
am
i
doing
i
must
put
an
end
to
and
again
he
felt
afraid
and
again
to
escape
from
that
thought
he
went
on
thinking
about
pashenka
so
he
lay
for
a
long
time
thinking
now
of
his
unavoidable
end
and
now
of
pashenka
she
presented
herself
to
him
as
a
means
of
salvation
at
last
he
fell
asleep
and
in
his
sleep
he
saw
an
angel
who
came
to
him
and
said
go
to
pashenka
and
learn
from
her
what
you
have
to
do
what
your
sin
is
and
wherein
lies
your
he
awoke
and
having
decided
that
this
was
a
vision
sent
by
god
he
felt
glad
and
resolved
to
do
what
had
been
told
him
in
the
vision
he
knew
the
town
where
she
lived
it
was
some
three
hundred
versts
two
hundred
miles
away
and
he
set
out
to
walk
there
vi
pashenka
had
already
long
ceased
to
be
pashenka
and
had
become
old
withered
wrinkled
praskovya
mikhaylovna
of
that
failure
the
drunken
official
mavrikyev
she
was
living
in
the
country
town
where
he
had
had
his
last
appointment
and
there
she
was
supporting
the
family
her
daughter
her
ailing
neurasthenic
and
her
five
grandchildren
she
did
this
by
giving
music
lessons
to
tradesmen
s
daughters
giving
four
and
sometimes
five
lessons
a
day
of
an
hour
each
and
earning
in
this
way
some
sixty
rubles
pounds
a
month
so
they
lived
for
the
present
in
expectation
of
another
appointment
she
had
sent
letters
to
all
her
relations
and
acquaintances
asking
them
to
obtain
a
post
for
her
and
among
the
rest
she
had
written
to
sergius
but
that
letter
had
not
reached
him
it
was
a
saturday
and
praskovya
mikhaylovna
was
herself
mixing
dough
for
currant
bread
such
as
the
on
her
father
s
estate
used
to
make
so
well
she
wished
to
give
her
grandchildren
a
treat
on
the
sunday
masha
her
daughter
was
nursing
her
youngest
child
the
eldest
boy
and
girl
were
at
school
and
her
was
asleep
not
having
slept
during
the
night
praskovya
mikhaylovna
had
remained
awake
too
for
a
great
part
of
the
night
trying
to
soften
her
daughter
s
anger
against
her
husband
she
saw
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
a
weak
creature
to
be
other
than
he
was
and
realized
that
his
wife
s
reproaches
could
do
no
good
so
she
used
all
her
efforts
to
soften
those
reproaches
and
to
avoid
recrimination
and
anger
unkindly
relations
between
people
caused
her
actual
physical
suffering
it
was
so
clear
to
her
that
bitter
feelings
do
not
make
anything
better
but
only
make
everything
worse
she
did
not
in
fact
think
about
this
she
simply
suffered
at
the
sight
of
anger
as
she
would
from
a
bad
smell
a
harsh
noise
or
from
blows
on
her
body
she
had
with
a
feeling
of
just
taught
lukerya
how
to
mix
the
dough
when
her
grandson
misha
wearing
an
apron
and
with
darned
stockings
on
his
crooked
little
legs
ran
into
the
kitchen
with
a
frightened
face
grandma
a
dreadful
old
man
wants
to
see
lukerya
looked
out
at
the
door
there
is
a
pilgrim
of
some
kind
a
man
praskovya
mikhaylovna
rubbed
her
thin
elbows
against
one
another
wiped
her
hands
on
her
apron
and
went
upstairs
to
get
a
piece
about
a
penny
out
of
her
purse
for
him
but
remembering
that
she
had
nothing
less
than
a
piece
she
decided
to
give
him
some
bread
instead
she
returned
to
the
cupboard
but
suddenly
blushed
at
the
thought
of
having
grudged
the
piece
and
telling
lukerya
to
cut
a
slice
of
bread
went
upstairs
again
to
fetch
it
it
serves
you
right
she
said
to
herself
you
must
now
give
twice
she
gave
both
the
bread
and
the
money
to
the
pilgrim
and
when
doing
so
far
from
being
proud
of
her
generosity
she
excused
herself
for
giving
so
little
the
man
had
such
an
imposing
appearance
though
he
had
tramped
two
hundred
versts
as
a
beggar
though
he
was
tattered
and
had
grown
thin
and
weatherbeaten
though
he
had
cropped
his
long
hair
and
was
wearing
a
peasant
s
cap
and
boots
and
though
he
bowed
very
humbly
sergius
still
had
the
impressive
appearance
that
made
him
so
attractive
but
praskovya
mikhaylovna
did
not
recognize
him
she
could
hardly
do
so
not
having
seen
him
for
almost
twenty
years
don
t
think
ill
of
me
father
perhaps
you
want
something
to
eat
he
took
the
bread
and
the
money
and
praskovya
mikhaylovna
was
surprised
that
he
did
not
go
but
stood
looking
at
her
pashenka
i
have
come
to
you
take
me
in
his
beautiful
black
eyes
shining
with
the
tears
that
started
in
them
were
fixed
on
her
with
imploring
insistence
and
under
his
greyish
moustache
his
lips
quivered
piteously
praskovya
mikhaylovna
pressed
her
hands
to
her
withered
breast
opened
her
mouth
and
stood
petrified
staring
at
the
pilgrim
with
dilated
eyes
it
can
t
be
stepa
sergey
father
sergius
yes
it
is
i
said
sergius
in
a
low
voice
only
not
sergius
or
father
sergius
but
a
great
sinner
stepan
kasatsky
a
great
and
lost
sinner
take
me
in
and
help
me
it
s
impossible
how
have
you
so
humbled
yourself
but
come
she
reached
out
her
hand
but
he
did
not
take
it
and
only
followed
her
in
but
where
was
she
to
take
him
the
lodging
was
a
small
one
formerly
she
had
had
a
tiny
room
almost
a
closet
for
herself
but
later
she
had
given
it
up
to
her
daughter
and
masha
was
now
sitting
there
rocking
the
baby
sit
here
for
the
present
she
said
to
sergius
pointing
to
a
bench
in
the
kitchen
he
sat
down
at
once
and
with
an
evidently
accustomed
movement
slipped
the
straps
of
his
wallet
first
off
one
shoulder
and
then
off
the
other
my
god
my
god
how
you
have
humbled
yourself
father
such
great
fame
and
now
like
this
sergius
did
not
reply
but
only
smiled
meekly
placing
his
wallet
under
the
bench
on
which
he
sat
masha
do
you
know
who
this
is
and
in
a
whisper
praskovya
mikhaylovna
told
her
daughter
who
he
was
and
together
they
then
carried
the
bed
and
the
cradle
out
of
the
tiny
room
and
cleared
it
for
sergius
praskovya
mikhaylovna
led
him
into
it
here
you
can
rest
don
t
take
offence
but
i
must
go
where
to
i
have
to
go
to
a
lesson
i
am
ashamed
to
tell
you
but
i
teach
music
music
but
that
is
good
only
just
one
thing
praskovya
mikhaylovna
i
have
come
to
you
with
a
definite
object
when
can
i
have
a
talk
with
you
i
shall
be
very
glad

this
evening

yes
but
one
thing
more

t
speak
about
me
or
say
who
i
am
i
have
revealed
myself
only
to
you
no
one
knows
where
i
have
gone
to
it
must
be
oh
but
i
have
told
my
well
ask
her
not
to
mention
and
sergius
took
off
his
boots
lay
down
and
at
once
fell
asleep
after
a
sleepless
night
and
a
walk
of
nearly
thirty
miles
when
praskovya
mikhaylovna
returned
sergius
was
sitting
in
the
little
room
waiting
for
her
he
did
not
come
out
for
dinner
but
had
some
soup
and
gruel
which
lukerya
brought
him
how
is
it
that
you
have
come
back
earlier
than
you
said
asked
sergius
can
i
speak
to
you
now
how
is
it
that
i
have
the
happiness
to
receive
such
a
guest
i
have
missed
one
of
my
lessons
that
can
wait
i
had
always
been
planning
to
go
to
see
you
i
wrote
to
you
and
now
this
good
fortune
has
pashenka
please
listen
to
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
as
to
a
confession
made
to
god
at
my
last
hour
pashenka
i
am
not
a
holy
man
i
am
not
even
as
good
as
a
simple
ordinary
man
i
am
a
loathsome
vile
and
proud
sinner
who
has
gone
astray
and
who
if
not
worse
than
everyone
else
is
at
least
worse
than
most
very
bad
pashenka
looked
at
him
at
first
with
staring
eyes
but
she
believed
what
he
said
and
when
she
had
quite
grasped
it
she
touched
his
hand
smiling
pityingly
and
said
perhaps
you
exaggerate
stiva
no
pashenka
i
am
an
adulterer
a
murderer
a
blasphemer
and
a
my
god
how
is
that
exclaimed
praskovya
mikhaylovna
but
i
must
go
on
living
and
i
who
thought
i
knew
everything
who
taught
others
how
to
live
i
know
nothing
and
ask
you
to
teach
what
are
you
saying
stiva
you
are
laughing
at
me
why
do
you
always
make
fun
of
me
well
if
you
think
i
am
jesting
you
must
have
it
as
you
please
but
tell
me
all
the
same
how
you
live
and
how
you
have
lived
your
i
i
have
lived
a
very
nasty
horrible
life
and
now
god
is
punishing
me
as
i
deserve
i
live
so
wretchedly
so
wretchedly
how
was
it
with
your
marriage
how
did
you
live
with
your
husband
it
was
all
bad
i
married
because
i
fell
in
love
in
the
nastiest
way
papa
did
not
approve
but
i
would
not
listen
to
anything
and
just
got
married
then
instead
of
helping
my
husband
i
tormented
him
by
my
jealousy
which
i
could
not
i
heard
that
he
drank
yes
but
i
did
not
give
him
any
peace
i
always
reproached
him
though
you
know
it
is
a
disease
he
could
not
refrain
from
it
i
now
remember
how
i
tried
to
prevent
his
having
it
and
the
frightful
scenes
we
had
and
she
looked
at
kasatsky
with
beautiful
eyes
suffering
from
the
remembrance
kasatsky
remembered
how
he
had
been
told
that
pashenka
s
husband
used
to
beat
her
and
now
looking
at
her
thin
withered
neck
with
prominent
veins
behind
her
ears
and
her
scanty
coil
of
hair
half
grey
half
auburn
he
seemed
to
see
just
how
it
had
occurred
then
i
was
left
with
two
children
and
no
means
at
but
you
had
an
estate
oh
we
sold
that
while
vasya
was
still
alive
and
the
money
was
all
spent
we
had
to
live
and
like
all
our
young
ladies
i
did
not
know
how
to
earn
anything
i
was
particularly
useless
and
helpless
so
we
spent
all
we
had
i
taught
the
children
and
improved
my
own
education
a
little
and
then
mitya
fell
ill
when
he
was
already
in
the
fourth
form
and
god
took
him
masha
fell
in
love
with
vanya
my
and
well
he
is
but
unfortunate
he
is
mamma
her
daughter
s
voice
interrupted
her
take
mitya
i
can
t
be
in
two
places
at
praskovya
mikhaylovna
shuddered
but
rose
and
went
out
of
the
room
stepping
quickly
in
her
patched
shoes
she
soon
came
back
with
a
boy
of
two
in
her
arms
who
threw
himself
backwards
and
grabbed
at
her
shawl
with
his
little
hands
where
was
i
oh
yes
he
had
a
good
appointment
here
and
his
chief
was
a
kind
man
too
but
vanya
could
not
go
on
and
had
to
give
up
his
what
is
the
matter
with
him
neurasthenia
it
is
a
dreadful
complaint
we
consulted
a
doctor
who
told
us
he
ought
to
go
away
but
we
had
no
means
i
always
hope
it
will
pass
of
itself
he
has
no
particular
pain
but
lukerya
cried
an
angry
and
feeble
voice
she
is
always
sent
away
when
i
want
her
mamma
i
m
coming
praskovya
mikhaylovna
again
interrupted
herself
he
has
not
had
his
dinner
yet
he
can
t
eat
with
she
went
out
and
arranged
something
and
came
back
wiping
her
thin
dark
hands
so
that
is
how
i
live
i
always
complain
and
am
always
dissatisfied
but
thank
god
the
grandchildren
are
all
nice
and
healthy
and
we
can
still
live
but
why
talk
about
me
but
what
do
you
live
on
well
i
earn
a
little
how
i
used
to
dislike
music
but
how
useful
it
is
to
me
now
her
small
hand
lay
on
the
chest
of
drawers
beside
which
she
was
sitting
and
she
drummed
an
exercise
with
her
thin
fingers
how
much
do
you
get
for
a
lesson
sometimes
a
ruble
sometimes
fifty
kopeks
or
sometimes
thirty
they
are
all
so
kind
to
and
do
your
pupils
get
on
well
asked
kasatsky
with
a
slight
smile
praskovya
mikhaylovna
did
not
at
first
believe
that
he
was
asking
seriously
and
looked
inquiringly
into
his
eyes
some
of
them
do
one
of
them
is
a
splendid
girl
the
butcher
s
daughter
such
a
good
kind
girl
if
i
were
a
clever
woman
i
ought
of
course
with
the
connexions
papa
had
to
be
able
to
get
an
appointment
for
my
but
as
it
is
i
have
not
been
able
to
do
anything
and
have
brought
them
all
to
this
as
you
yes
yes
said
kasatsky
lowering
his
head
and
how
is
it
pashenka
do
you
take
part
in
church
life
oh
don
t
speak
of
it
i
am
so
bad
that
way
and
have
neglected
it
so
i
keep
the
fasts
with
the
children
and
sometimes
go
to
church
and
then
again
sometimes
i
don
t
go
for
months
i
only
send
the
but
why
don
t
you
go
yourself
to
tell
the
truth
she
blushed
i
am
ashamed
for
my
daughter
s
sake
and
the
children
s
to
go
there
in
tattered
clothes
and
i
haven
t
anything
else
besides
i
am
just
and
do
you
pray
at
home
i
do
but
what
sort
of
prayer
is
it
only
mechanical
i
know
it
should
not
be
like
that
but
i
lack
real
religious
feeling
the
only
thing
is
that
i
know
how
bad
i
am
yes
yes
that
s
right
said
kasatsky
as
if
approvingly
i
m
coming
i
m
coming
she
replied
to
a
call
from
her
and
tidying
her
scanty
plait
she
left
the
room
but
this
time
it
was
long
before
she
returned
when
she
came
back
kasatsky
was
sitting
in
the
same
position
his
elbows
resting
on
his
knees
and
his
head
bowed
but
his
wallet
was
strapped
on
his
back
when
she
came
in
carrying
a
small
tin
lamp
without
a
shade
he
raised
his
fine
weary
eyes
and
sighed
very
deeply
i
did
not
tell
them
who
you
are
she
began
timidly
i
only
said
that
you
are
a
pilgrim
a
nobleman
and
that
i
used
to
know
you
come
into
the
for
no
well
then
i
ll
bring
some
to
you
no
i
don
t
want
anything
god
bless
you
pashenka
i
am
going
now
if
you
pity
me
don
t
tell
anyone
that
you
have
seen
me
for
the
love
of
god
don
t
tell
anyone
thank
you
i
would
bow
to
your
feet
but
i
know
it
would
make
you
feel
awkward
thank
you
and
forgive
me
for
christ
s
sake
give
me
your
god
bless
you
forgive
me
for
christ
s
sake
he
rose
but
she
would
not
let
him
go
until
she
had
given
him
bread
and
butter
and
rusks
he
took
it
all
and
went
away
it
was
dark
and
before
he
had
passed
the
second
house
he
was
lost
to
sight
she
only
knew
he
was
there
because
the
dog
at
the
priest
s
house
was
barking
so
that
is
what
my
dream
meant
pashenka
is
what
i
ought
to
have
been
but
failed
to
be
i
lived
for
men
on
the
pretext
of
living
for
god
while
she
lived
for
god
imagining
that
she
lives
for
men
yes
one
good
deed
a
cup
of
water
given
without
thought
of
reward
is
worth
more
than
any
benefit
i
imagined
i
was
bestowing
on
people
but
after
all
was
there
not
some
share
of
sincere
desire
to
serve
god
he
asked
himself
and
the
answer
was
yes
there
was
but
it
was
all
soiled
and
overgrown
by
desire
for
human
praise
yes
there
is
no
god
for
the
man
who
lives
as
i
did
for
human
praise
i
will
now
seek
him
and
he
walked
from
village
to
village
as
he
had
done
on
his
way
to
pashenka
meeting
and
parting
from
other
pilgrims
men
and
women
and
asking
for
bread
and
a
night
s
rest
in
christ
s
name
occasionally
some
angry
housewife
scolded
him
or
a
drunken
peasant
reviled
him
but
for
the
most
part
he
was
given
food
and
drink
and
even
something
to
take
with
him
his
noble
bearing
disposed
some
people
in
his
favour
while
others
on
the
contrary
seemed
pleased
at
the
sight
of
a
gentleman
who
had
come
to
beggary
but
his
gentleness
prevailed
with
everyone
often
finding
a
copy
of
the
gospels
in
a
hut
he
would
read
it
aloud
and
when
they
heard
him
the
people
were
always
touched
and
surprised
as
at
something
new
yet
familiar
when
he
succeeded
in
helping
people
either
by
advice
or
by
his
knowledge
of
reading
and
writing
or
by
settling
some
quarrel
he
did
not
wait
to
see
their
gratitude
but
went
away
directly
afterwards
and
little
by
little
god
began
to
reveal
himself
within
him
once
he
was
walking
along
with
two
old
women
and
a
soldier
they
were
stopped
by
a
party
consisting
of
a
lady
and
gentleman
in
a
gig
and
another
lady
and
gentleman
on
horseback
the
husband
was
on
horseback
with
his
daughter
while
in
the
gig
his
wife
was
driving
with
a
frenchman
evidently
a
traveller
the
party
stopped
to
let
the
frenchman
see
the
pilgrims
who
in
accord
with
a
popular
russian
superstition
tramped
about
from
place
to
place
instead
of
working
they
spoke
french
thinking
that
the
others
would
not
understand
them
said
the
frenchman
s
ils
sont
bien
sur
de
ce
que
leur
pelerinage
est
agreable
a
the
question
was
asked
and
one
old
woman
replied
as
god
takes
it
our
feet
have
reached
the
holy
places
but
our
hearts
may
not
have
done
they
asked
the
soldier
he
said
that
he
was
alone
in
the
world
and
had
nowhere
else
to
go
they
asked
kasatsky
who
he
was
a
servant
of
qu
qu
il
dit
il
ne
repond
il
dit
qu
il
est
un
serviteur
de
dieu
cela
doit
etre
un
fils
de
preetre
il
a
de
la
race
de
la
petite
monnaie
the
frenchman
found
some
small
change
and
gave
twenty
kopeks
to
each
of
the
pilgrims
mais
que
ce
n
est
pas
pour
les
cierges
que
je
leur
donne
mais
pour
qu
ils
se
regalent
de
the
chay
chay
pour
vous
mon
vieux
he
said
with
a
smile
and
he
patted
kasatsky
on
the
shoulder
with
his
gloved
hand
may
christ
bless
you
replied
kasatsky
without
replacing
his
cap
and
bowing
his
bald
head
he
rejoiced
particularly
at
this
meeting
because
he
had
disregarded
the
opinion
of
men
and
had
done
the
simplest
easiest
thing
humbly
accepted
twenty
kopeks
and
given
them
to
his
comrade
a
blind
beggar
the
less
importance
he
attached
to
the
opinion
of
men
the
more
did
he
feel
the
presence
of
god
within
him
for
eight
months
kasatsky
tramped
on
in
this
manner
and
in
the
ninth
month
he
was
arrested
for
not
having
a
passport
this
happened
at
a
in
a
provincial
town
where
he
had
passed
the
night
with
some
pilgrims
he
was
taken
to
the
and
when
asked
who
he
was
and
where
was
his
passport
he
replied
that
he
had
no
passport
and
that
he
was
a
servant
of
god
he
was
classed
as
a
tramp
sentenced
and
sent
to
live
in
siberia
in
siberia
he
has
settled
down
as
the
hired
man
of
a
peasant
in
which
capacity
he
works
in
the
teaches
children
and
attends
to
the
sick
