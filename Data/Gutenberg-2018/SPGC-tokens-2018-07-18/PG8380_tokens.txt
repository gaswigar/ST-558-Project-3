after
my
return
from
cuba
many
people
asked
me
questions
concerning
the
situation
there
and
i
noticed
that
they
generally
asked
the
same
questions
this
book
has
been
published
with
the
idea
of
answering
those
questions
as
fully
as
is
possible
for
me
to
do
after
a
journey
through
the
island
during
which
i
traveled
in
four
of
the
six
provinces
visiting
towns
seaports
plantations
and
military
camps
and
stopping
for
several
days
in
all
of
the
chief
cities
of
cuba
with
the
exception
of
santiago
and
pinar
del
rio
part
of
this
book
was
published
originally
in
the
form
of
letters
from
cuba
to
the
york
and
in
the
newspapers
of
a
syndicate
arranged
by
the
the
remainder
which
was
suggested
by
the
questions
asked
on
my
return
was
written
in
this
country
and
appears
here
for
the
first
time
richard

cuba
in
war
time
when
the
revolution
broke
out
in
cuba
two
years
ago
the
spaniards
at
once
began
to
build
tiny
forts
and
continued
to
add
to
these
and
improve
those
already
built
until
now
the
whole
island
which
is
eight
hundred
miles
long
and
averages
eighty
miles
in
width
is
studded
as
thickly
with
these
little
forts
as
is
the
sole
of
a
brogan
with
iron
nails
it
is
necessary
to
keep
the
fact
of
the
existence
of
these
forts
in
mind
in
order
to
understand
the
situation
in
cuba
at
the
present
time
as
they
illustrate
the
spanish
plan
of
campaign
and
explain
why
the
war
has
dragged
on
for
so
long
and
why
it
may
continue
indefinitely
the
last
revolution
was
organized
by
the
aristocrats
the
present
one
is
a
revolution
of
the
and
while
the
principal
cuban
families
are
again
among
the
leaders
with
them
now
are
the
representatives
of
the
plain
people
and
the
cause
is
now
a
common
cause
in
working
for
the
success
of
which
all
classes
of
cubans
are
desperately
in
earnest
the
outbreak
of
this
revolution
was
hastened
by
an
offer
from
spain
to
make
certain
reforms
in
the
internal
government
of
the
island
the
old
revolutionary
leaders
fearing
that
the
promise
of
these
reforms
might
satisfy
the
cubans
and
that
they
would
cease
to
hope
for
complete
independence
started
the
revolt
and
asked
all
loyal
cubans
not
to
accept
the
reforms
when
by
fighting
they
might
obtain
their
freedom
another
cause
which
precipitated
the
revolution
was
the
financial
depression
which
existed
all
over
the
island
in
and
the
closing
of
the
sugar
mills
in
consequence
owing
to
the
lack
of
money
with
which
to
pay
the
laborers
the
grinding
of
the
sugar
cane
ceased
and
the
men
were
turned
off
by
the
hundreds
and
for
want
of
something
better
to
do
joined
the
insurgents
some
planters
believe
that
had
spain
loaned
them
sufficient
money
with
which
to
continue
grinding
the
men
would
have
remained
on
the
as
the
machine
shops
and
residence
of
a
sugar
plantation
are
called
and
that
so
few
would
have
gone
into
the
field
against
spain
that
the
insurrection
could
have
been
put
down
before
it
had
gained
headway
an
advance
to
the
sugar
planters
of
five
millions
of
dollars
then
so
they
say
would
have
saved
spain
the
outlay
of
many
hundreds
of
millions
spent
later
in
supporting
an
army
in
the
field
that
may
or
may
not
be
true
and
it
is
not
important
now
for
spain
did
not
attack
the
insurgents
in
that
way
but
began
hastily
to
build
forts
these
forts
now
stretch
all
over
the
island
some
in
straight
lines
some
in
circles
and
some
from
to
some
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
next
and
others
so
near
that
the
sentries
can
toss
a
cartridge
from
one
to
the
other
the
island
is
divided
into
two
great
military
camps
one
situated
within
the
forts
and
the
other
scattered
over
the
fields
and
mountains
outside
of
them
the
spaniards
have
absolute
control
over
everything
within
the
fortified
places
that
is
in
all
cities
towns
seaports
and
along
the
lines
of
the
railroad
the
insurgents
are
in
possession
of
all
the
rest
they
are
not
in
fixed
possession
but
they
have
control
much
as
a
mad
bull
may
be
said
to
have
control
of
a
lot
when
he
goes
on
the
rampage
some
farmer
may
hold
a
legal
right
to
the
lot
through
title
deeds
or
in
the
shape
of
a
mortgage
and
the
bull
may
occupy
but
one
part
of
it
at
a
time
but
he
has
possession
which
is
better
than
the
law
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
line
drawn
so
closely
not
about
one
city
or
town
but
around
every
city
and
town
in
cuba
that
no
one
can
pass
the
line
from
either
the
outside
or
the
inside
the
spaniards
however
have
succeeded
in
effecting
and
maintaining
a
blockade
of
that
kind
they
have
placed
forts
next
to
the
rows
of
houses
or
huts
on
the
outskirts
of
each
town
within
a
hundred
yards
of
one
another
and
outside
of
this
circle
is
another
circle
and
beyond
that
on
every
high
piece
of
ground
are
still
more
of
these
little
square
forts
which
are
not
much
larger
than
the
signal
stations
along
the
lines
of
our
railroads
and
not
unlike
them
in
appearance
no
one
can
cross
the
line
of
the
forts
without
a
pass
nor
enter
from
the
country
beyond
them
without
an
order
showing
from
what
place
he
comes
at
what
time
he
left
that
place
and
that
he
had
permission
from
the
commandante
to
leave
it
a
stranger
in
any
city
in
cuba
is
virtually
in
a
prison
and
is
as
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
world
as
though
he
were
on
a
desert
island
or
a
floating
ship
of
war
when
he
wishes
to
depart
he
is
free
to
do
so
but
he
can
not
leave
on
foot
nor
on
horseback
he
must
make
his
departure
on
a
railroad
train
of
which
seldom
more
than
two
leave
any
town
in
hours
one
going
east
and
the
other
west
from
havana
a
number
of
trains
depart
daily
in
different
directions
but
once
outside
of
havana
there
is
only
one
train
back
to
it
again
when
on
the
cars
you
are
still
in
the
presence
and
under
the
care
of
spanish
soldiers
and
the
progress
of
the
train
is
closely
guarded
a
pilot
engine
precedes
it
at
a
distance
of
one
hundred
yards
to
test
the
rails
and
pick
up
dynamite
bombs
and
in
front
of
it
is
a
car
covered
with
armor
plate
with
slits
in
the
sides
like
those
in
a
letter
box
through
which
the
soldiers
may
fire
there
are
generally
from
twenty
to
fifty
soldiers
in
each
armored
car
back
of
the
armored
car
is
a
flat
car
loaded
with
ties
girders
and
rails
which
are
used
to
repair
bridges
or
those
portions
of
the
track
that
may
have
been
blown
up
by
the
insurgents
wherever
a
track
crosses
a
bridge
there
are
two
forts
one
at
each
end
of
the
bridge
and
also
at
almost
every
when
the
train
passes
one
of
these
forts
two
soldiers
appear
in
the
door
and
stand
at
salute
to
show
probably
that
they
are
awake
and
at
every
station
there
are
two
or
more
forts
while
the
stations
themselves
are
usually
protected
by
ramparts
of
ties
and
steel
rails
there
is
no
situation
where
it
is
so
distinctly
evident
that
those
who
are
not
with
you
are
against
you
for
you
are
either
inside
of
one
circle
of
forts
or
passing
under
guard
by
rail
to
another
circle
or
you
are
with
the
insurgents
there
is
no
alternative
if
you
walk
fifty
yards
away
from
the
circle
you
are
in
the
eyes
of
the
spaniards
as
much
in
the
field
as
though
you
were
two
hundred
miles
away
on
the
mountains
illustration
a
spanish
soldier
the
lines
are
so
closely
drawn
that
when
you
consider
the
tremendous
amount
of
time
and
labor
expended
in
keeping
up
this
blockade
you
must
admire
the
spaniards
for
doing
it
so
well
but
you
would
admire
them
more
if
instead
of
stopping
content
with
that
they
went
further
and
invaded
the
field
the
forts
are
an
excellent
precaution
they
prevent
sympathizers
from
joining
the
insurgents
and
from
sending
them
food
arms
medicine
or
messages
but
the
next
step
after
blockading
the
cities
would
appear
to
be
to
follow
the
insurgents
into
the
field
and
give
them
battle
this
the
spaniards
do
not
seem
to
consider
important
nor
wish
to
do
flying
columns
of
regular
troops
and
guerrillas
are
sent
out
daily
but
they
always
return
each
evening
within
the
circle
of
forts
if
they
meet
a
band
of
insurgents
they
give
battle
readily
enough
but
they
never
pursue
the
enemy
and
instead
of
camping
on
the
ground
and
following
him
up
the
next
morning
they
retreat
as
soon
as
the
battle
is
over
to
the
town
where
they
are
stationed
when
occasionally
objection
is
made
to
this
by
a
superior
officer
they
give
as
an
explanation
that
they
were
afraid
of
being
led
into
an
ambush
and
that
as
an
officer
first
consideration
must
be
for
his
men
they
decided
that
it
was
wiser
not
to
follow
the
enemy
into
what
might
prove
a
or
the
officers
say
they
could
not
abandon
their
wounded
while
they
pursued
the
rebels
sometimes
a
force
of
one
thousand
men
will
return
with
three
men
wounded
and
will
offer
their
condition
as
an
excuse
for
having
failed
to
follow
the
enemy
about
five
years
ago
troops
of
united
states
cavalry
were
sent
into
the
chapparal
on
the
border
of
mexico
and
texas
to
drive
the
garcia
revolutionists
back
into
their
own
country
one
troop
g
third
cavalry
was
ordered
out
for
seven
days
service
but
when
i
joined
the
troop
later
as
a
correspondent
it
had
been
in
the
field
for
three
months
sleeping
the
entire
time
under
canvas
and
carrying
all
its
impedimenta
with
it
on
pack
mules
it
had
seldom
if
ever
been
near
a
town
and
the
men
wore
the
same
clothes
or
what
was
left
of
them
with
which
they
had
started
for
a
week
campaign
had
the
spaniards
followed
such
a
plan
of
attack
as
that
when
the
revolution
began
instead
of
building
mud
forts
and
devastating
the
country
they
might
not
only
have
suppressed
the
revolution
but
the
country
would
have
been
of
some
value
when
the
war
ended
as
it
is
it
will
take
ten
years
or
more
to
bring
it
back
to
a
condition
of
productiveness
the
wholesale
devastation
of
the
island
was
an
idea
of
general
weyler
if
the
captain
of
a
vessel
in
order
to
put
down
a
mutiny
on
board
scuttled
the
ship
and
sent
everybody
to
the
bottom
his
plan
of
action
would
be
as
successful
as
general
weyler
has
proved
to
be
after
he
had
obtained
complete
control
of
the
cities
he
decided
to
lay
waste
the
country
and
starve
the
revolutionists
into
submission
so
he
ordered
all
pac√≠ficos
as
the
are
called
into
the
towns
and
burned
their
houses
and
issued
orders
to
have
all
fields
where
potatoes
or
corn
were
planted
dug
up
and
these
food
products
destroyed
these
pacificos
are
now
gathered
inside
of
a
dead
line
drawn
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
around
the
towns
or
wherever
there
is
a
fort
some
of
them
have
settled
around
the
forts
that
guard
a
bridge
others
around
the
forts
that
guard
a
sugar
plantation
wherever
there
are
forts
there
are
pacificos
in
a
word
the
situation
in
cuba
is
something
like
this
the
spaniards
hold
the
towns
from
which
their
troops
daily
make
predatory
raids
invariably
returning
in
time
for
dinner
at
night
around
each
town
is
a
circle
of
pacificos
doing
no
work
and
for
the
most
part
starving
and
diseased
and
outside
in
the
plains
and
mountains
are
the
insurgents
no
one
knows
just
where
any
one
band
of
them
is
or
where
it
may
be
sometimes
they
come
up
to
the
very
walls
of
the
fort
lasso
a
bunch
of
cattle
and
ride
off
again
and
the
next
morning
their
presence
may
be
detected
ten
miles
away
where
they
are
setting
fire
to
a
cane
field
or
a
sugar
plantation
illustration

this
is
the
situation
so
far
as
the
inhabitants
are
concerned
the
physical
appearance
of
the
country
since
the
war
began
has
changed
greatly
in
the
days
of
peace
cuba
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
islands
in
the
tropics
perhaps
in
the
world
its
skies
hang
low
and
are
brilliantly
beautiful
with
great
expanses
of
blue
and
in
the
early
morning
and
before
sunset
they
are
lighted
with
wonderful
clouds
of
pink
and
saffron
as
brilliant
and
as
unreal
as
the
fairy
grotto
in
a
pantomime
there
are
great
prairies
of
high
grass
or
tall
sugar
cane
and
on
the
sea
coast
mountains
of
a
light
green
like
the
green
of
corroded
copper
changing
to
a
darker
shade
near
the
base
where
they
are
covered
with
forests
of
palms
throughout
the
extent
of
the
island
run
many
little
streams
sometimes
between
high
banks
of
rock
covered
with
moss
and
magnificent
fern
with
great
pools
of
clear
deep
water
at
the
base
of
high
waterfalls
and
in
those
places
where
the
stream
cuts
its
way
through
the
level
plains
double
rows
of
the
royal
palm
mark
its
course
the
royal
palm
is
the
characteristic
feature
of
the
landscape
in
cuba
it
is
the
most
beautiful
of
all
palms
and
possibly
the
most
beautiful
of
all
trees
the
cocoanut
palm
as
one
sees
it
in
egypt
picturesque
as
it
is
has
a
pathetic
resemblance
to
a
shabby
feather
duster
and
its
trunk
bends
and
twists
as
though
it
had
not
the
strength
to
push
its
way
through
the
air
and
to
hold
itself
erect
but
the
royal
palm
shoots
up
boldly
from
the
earth
with
the
grace
and
symmetry
of
a
marble
pillar
or
the
white
mast
of
a
great
ship
its
trunk
swells
in
the
centre
and
grows
smaller
again
at
the
top
where
it
is
hidden
by
great
bunches
of
green
plumes
like
monstrous
ostrich
feathers
that
wave
and
bow
and
bend
in
the
breeze
as
do
the
plumes
on
the
head
of
a
beautiful
woman
standing
isolated
in
an
open
plain
or
in
ranks
in
a
forest
of
palms
this
tree
is
always
beautiful
noble
and
full
of
meaning
it
makes
you
forget
the
ugly
iron
chimneys
of
the
and
it
is
the
first
and
the
last
feature
that
appeals
to
the
visitor
in
cuba
but
since
the
revolution
came
to
cuba
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
is
blotted
with
the
grim
and
pitiable
signs
of
war
the
sugar
cane
has
turned
to
a
dirty
brown
where
the
fire
has
passed
through
it
the
are
black
ruins
and
the

roofless
and

pathetically
at

like
blind

war
can
not
alter
the
sunshine
but
the
smoke
from
the
burning
huts
and
the
blazing
corn
fields
seems
all
the
more
sad
and
terrible
when
it
rises
into
such
an
atmosphere
and
against
so
soft
and
beautiful
a
sky
people
frequently
ask
how
far
the
destruction
of
property
in
cuba
is
apparent
it
is
so
far
apparent
that
the
smoke
of
burning
buildings
is
seldom
absent
from
the
landscape
if
you
stand
on
an
elevation
it
is
possible
to
see
from
ten
to
twenty
blazing
houses
and
the
smoke
from
the
cane
fields
creeping
across
the
plain
or
rising
slowly
to
meet
the
sky
sometimes
the
train
passes
for
hours
through
burning
districts
and
the
heat
from
the
fields
along
the
track
is
so
intense
that
it
is
impossible
to
keep
the
windows
up
and
whenever
the
door
is
opened
sparks
and
cinders
sweep
into
the
car
one
morning
just
this
side
of
jovellanos
all
the
sugar
cane
on
the
right
side
of
the
track
was
wrapped
in
white
smoke
for
miles
so
that
nothing
could
be
distinguished
from
that
side
of
the
car
and
we
seemed
to
be
moving
through
the
white
steam
of
a
russian
bath
the
spaniards
are
no
more
to
blame
for
this
than
are
the
insurgents
each
destroy
property
and
burn
the
cane
when
an
insurgent
column
finds
a
field
planted
with
potatoes
it
takes
as
much
of
the
crop
as
it
can
carry
away
and
chops
up
the
remainder
with
machetes
to
prevent
it
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
spaniards
if
the
spaniards
pass
first
they
act
in
exactly
the
same
way
cane
is
not
completely
destroyed
if
it
is
burned
for
if
it
is
at
once
cut
down
just
above
the
roots
it
will
grow
again
when
peace
is
declared
it
will
not
be
the
soil
that
will
be
found
wanting
nor
the
sun
it
will
be
the
lack
of
money
and
the
loss
of
credit
that
will
keep
the
sugar
planters
from
sowing
and
grinding
and
the
loss
of
machinery
in
the
which
is
worth
in
single
instances
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
and
in
the
aggregate
many
millions
can
not
be
replaced
by
men
who
even
when
their
machinery
was
intact
were
on
the
brink
of
ruin
unless
the
united
states
government
interferes
on
account
of
some
one
of
its
citizens
in
cuba
and
war
is
declared
with
spain
there
is
no
saying
how
long
the
present
revolution
may
continue
for
the
spaniards
themselves
are
acting
in
a
way
which
makes
many
people
suspect
that
they
are
not
making
an
effort
to
bring
it
to
an
end
the
sincerity
of
the
spaniards
in
spain
is
beyond
question
the
personal
sacrifices
they
made
in
taking
up
the
loans
issued
by
the
government
are
proof
of
their
loyalty
but
the
spaniards
in
cuba
are
acting
for
their
own
interests
many
of
the
planters
in
order
to
save
their
fields
and
from
destruction
are
unquestionably
aiding
the
insurgents
in
secret
and
though
they
shout
viva
espa√±a
in
the
cities
they
pay
out
cartridges
and
money
at
the
back
door
of
their
plantations
illustration
a
spanish
officer
it
was
because
weyler
suspected
that
they
were
playing
this
double
game
that
he
issued
secret
orders
that
there
should
be
no
more
grinding
for
he
knew
that
the
same
men
who
bribed
him
to
allow
them
to
grind
would
also
pay
blackmail
to
the
insurgents
for
a
like
permission
he
did
not
dare
openly
to
forbid
the
grinding
but
he
instructed
his
officers
in
the
field
to
visit
those
places
where
grinding
was
in
progress
and
to
stop
it
by
some
indirect
means
such
as
by
declaring
that
the
laborers
employed
were
suspects
or
by
seizing
all
the
draught
oxen
ostensibly
for
the
use
of
his
army
or
by
insisting
that
the
men
employed
must
show
a
fresh
permit
to
work
every
day
which
could
only
be
issued
to
them
by
some
commandante
stationed
not
less
than
ten
miles
distant
from
the
plantation
on
which
they
were
employed
and
the
spanish
officers
as
well
as
the
planters
the
very
men
to
whom
spain
looks
to
end
the
rebellion
are
chief
among
those
who
are
keeping
it
alive
the
reasons
for
their
doing
so
are
obvious
they
receive
double
pay
while
they
are
on
foreign
service
whether
they
are
fighting
or
not
promotion
comes
twice
as
quickly
as
in
time
of
peace
and
orders
and
crosses
are
distributed
by
the
gross
they
are
also
able
to
make
small
fortunes
out
of
forced
loans
from
planters
and
suspects
and
they
undoubtedly
hold
back
for
themselves
a
great
part
of
the
pay
of
the
men
a
certain
class
of
spanish
officer
has
a
strange
sense
of
honor
he
does
not
consider
that
robbing
his
government
by
falsifying
his
accounts
or
by
making
incorrect
returns
of
his
expenses
is
disloyal
or
unpatriotic
he
holds
such
an
act
as
lightly
as
many
people
do
smuggling
cigars
through
their
own
custom
house
or
robbing
a
corporation
of
a
railroad
fare
he
might
be
perfectly
willing
to
die
for
his
country
but
should
he
be
permitted
to
live
he
will
not
hesitate
to
rob
her
a
lieutenant
for
instance
will
take
twenty
men
out
for
their
daily
walk
through
the
surrounding
country
and
after
burning
a
few
huts
and
butchering
a
pacifico
or
two
will
come
back
in
time
for
dinner
and
charge
his
captain
for
rations
for
fifty
men
and
for
three
thousand
cartridges
expended
in
service
the
captain
vises
his
report
and
the
two
share
the
profits
or
they
turn
the
money
over
to
the
colonel
who
recommends
them
for
red
enamelled
crosses
for
bravery
on
the
field
the
only
store
in
matanzas
that
was
doing
a
brisk
trade
when
i
was
there
was
a
jewelry
shop
where
they
had
sold
more
diamonds
and
watches
to
the
spanish
officers
since
the
revolution
broke
out
than
they
had
ever
been
able
to
dispose
of
before
to
all
the
rich
men
in
the
city
the
legitimate
pay
of
the
highest
ranking
officer
is
barely
enough
to
buy
red
wine
for
his
dinner
certainly
not
enough
to
pay
for
champagne
and
diamonds
so
it
is
not
unfair
to
suppose
that
the
rebellion
is
a
profitable
experience
for
the
officers
and
they
have
no
intention
of
losing
the
golden
eggs
and
the
insurgents
on
the
other
side
are
equally
determined
to
continue
the
conflict
from
every
point
of
view
this
is
all
that
is
left
for
them
to
do
they
know
by
terrible
experience
how
little
of
mercy
or
even
of
justice
they
may
expect
from
the
enemy
and
patriotism
or
the
love
of
independence
aside
it
is
better
for
them
to
die
in
the
field
than
to
risk
the
other
alternative
a
lingering
life
in
an
african
penal
settlement
or
the
fusillade
against
the
east
wall
of
caba√±as
prison
in
an
island
with
a
soil
so
rich
and
productive
as
is
that
of
cuba
there
will
always
be
roots
and
fruits
for
the
insurgents
to
live
upon
and
with
the
cattle
that
they
have
hidden
away
in
the
laurel
or
on
the
mountains
they
can
keep
their
troops
in
rations
for
an
indefinite
period
what
they
most
need
now
are
cartridges
and
rifles

they
have
already
more
than
they
can
arm

in
the
united
states
frequently
express
impatience
at
the
small
amount
of
fighting
which
takes
place
in
this
struggle
for
liberty
and
it
is
true
that
the
lists
of
killed
show
that
the
death
rate
in
battle
is
inconsiderable
indeed
when
compared
with
the
number
of
men
and
women
who
die
daily
of
and
fever
and
those
who
are
butchered
on
the
plantations
the
proportion
of
killed
in
battle
is
probably
about
one
to
fifteen
i
have
no
statistics
to
prove
these
figures
but
judging
from
the
hospital
reports
and
from
what
the
consuls
tell
of
the
many
murders
of
pacificos
i
judge
that
that
proportion
would
be
rather
under
than
above

the

who
was
for
nine

with

who
saw
eighty

told
me
that
the
largest
number
of

had
seen

in

was
thirteen

said
that
a
spanish
officer
had
told
him
that
he
had
killed
forty
insurgents
out
of
four
hundred
who
had
attacked
his
column
but
how
do
you
know

killed

many
the

asked
you
say
you
were
never
nearer
than
half
a
mile
to
them
and
that
you
fell
back

soon
as
they
ceased

these
stories
show
how
little
reason
there
is
to
speak
of
these
skirmishes
as
battles
and
it
also
throws
some
light
on
the
idea
of
his
own
marksmanship
as
a
plain
statement
of
fact
and
without
any
exaggeration
one
of
the
chief
reasons
why
half
the
insurgents
in
cuba
are
not
dead
is
because
the
spanish
soldiers
can
not
shoot
well
enough
to
hit
them
the
mauser
rifle
which
is
used
by
all
the
spanish
soldiers
with
the
exception
of
the
guardia
civile
is
a
most
excellent
weapon
for
those
who
like
clean
gentlemanly
warfare
in
which
the
object
is
to
wound
or
to
kill
outright
and
not
to
shock
the
enemy
nor
to
tear
his
flesh
in
pieces
the
weapon
has
hardly
any
trajectory
up
to
one
thousand
yards
but
in
spite
of
its
precision
it
is
as
useless
in
the
hands
of
a
guerrilla
or
the
average
spanish
soldier
as
a
bow
and
arrow
would
be
the
fact
that
when
the
spaniards
say
within
gun
fire
of
the
forts
they
mean
within
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
of
them
shows
how
they
estimate
their
own
skill

the
correspondent
told
me
of
a

he
witnessed

the

fired

only
two

and

sylvester
scovel
once
explained
this
bad
marksmanship
to
me
by
pointing
out
that
to
shift
the
cartridge
in
a
mauser
it
is
necessary
to
hold
the
rifle
at
an
almost
perpendicular
angle
and
close
up
under
the
shoulder
after
the
fresh
cartridge
has
gone
home
the
temptation
to
bring
the
butt
to
the
shoulder
before
the
barrel
is
level
is
too
great
for
the
spanish
tommy
and
in
his
excitement
he
fires
most
of
his
ammunition
in
the
air
over
the
heads
of
the
enemy
he
also
fires
so
recklessly
and
rapidly
that
his
gun
often
becomes
too
hot
for
him
to
handle
it
properly
and
it
is
not
an
unusual
sight
to
see
him
rest
the
butt
on
the
ground
and
pull
the
trigger
while
the
gun
is
in
that
position
on
the
whole
the
spanish
soldiers
during
this
war
in
cuba
have
contributed
little
to
the
information
of
those
who
are
interested
in
military
science
the
tactics
which
the
officers
follow
are
those
which
were
found
effective
at
the
battle
of
waterloo
and
in
the
peninsular
campaign
when
attacked
from
an
ambush
a
spanish
column
forms
at
once
into
a
hollow
square
with
the
cavalry
in
the
centre
and
the
firing
is
done
in
platoons
they
know
nothing
of
open
order
or
of
firing
in
skirmish
line
if
the
cubans
were
only
a
little
better
marksmen
than
their
enemies
they
should
with
such
a
target
as
a
square
furnishes
them
kill
about
ten
men
where
they
now
wound
one
with
the
war
conducted
under
the
conditions
described
here
there
does
not
seem
to
be
much
promise
of
its
coming
to
any
immediate
end
unless
some
power
will
interfere
the
spaniards
will
probably
continue
to
remain
inside
their
forts
and
the
officers
will
continue
to
pay
themselves
well
out
of
the
rebellion
and
on
the
other
hand

insurgents

call
themselves
rich
when
they
have
three
cartridges
as
opposed
to
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
cartridges
that
every
spanish
soldier
carries
will
probably
very
wisely
continue
to
refuse

in

the
fate
of
the
pacificos
as
is
already
well
known
in
the
united
states
general
weyler
issued
an
order
some
months
ago
commanding
the
country
people
living
in
the
provinces
of
pinar
del
rio
havana
and
matanzas
to
betake
themselves
with
their
belongings
to
the
fortified
towns
his
object
in
doing
this
was
to
prevent
the
pacificos
from
giving
help
to
the
insurgents
and
from
sheltering
them
and
the
wounded
in
their
huts
so
flying
columns
of
guerrillas
and
spanish
soldiers
were
sent
to
burn
these
huts
and
to
drive
the
inhabitants
into
the
suburbs
of
the
cities
when
i
arrived
in
cuba
sufficient
time
had
passed
for
me
to
note
the
effects
of
this
order
and
to
study
the
results
as
they
are
to
be
found
in
the
provinces
of
havana
matanzas
and
santa
clara
the
order
having
been
extended
to
embrace
the
latter
province
it
looked
then
as
though
general
weyler
was
reaping
what
he
had
sown
and
was
face
to
face
with
a
problem
of
his
own
creating
as
far
as
a
visitor
could
judge
the
results
of
this
famous
order
seemed
to
furnish
a
better
argument
to
those
who
think
the
united
states
should
interfere
in
behalf
of
cuba
than
did
the
fact
that
men
were
being
killed
there
and
that
both
sides
were
devastating
the
island
and
wrecking
property
worth
millions
of
dollars
the
order
apart
from
being
unprecedented
in
warfare
proved
an
exceedingly
one
and
acted
almost
immediately
after
the
manner
of
a
boomerang
the
men
of
each
family
who
had
remained
loyal
or
at
least
neutral
so
long
as
they
were
permitted
to
live
undisturbed
on
their
few
acres
were
not
content
to
exist
on
the
charity
of
a
city
and
they
swarmed
over
to
the
insurgent
ranks
by
the
hundreds
and
it
was
only
the
old
and
infirm
and
the
women
and
children
who
went
into
the
towns
where
they
at
once
became
a
burden
on
the
spanish
residents
who
were
already
distressed
by
the
lack
of
trade
and
the
high
prices
asked
for
food
the
order
failed
also
in
its
original
object
of
embarrassing
the
insurgents
for
they
are
used
to
living
out
of
doors
and
to
finding
food
for
themselves
and
the
destruction
of
the
huts
where
they
had
been
made
welcome
was
not
a
great
loss
to
men
who
in
a
few
minutes
with
the
aid
of
a
machete
can
construct
a
shelter
from
a
palm
tree
so
the
order
failed
to
distress
those
against
whom
it
was
aimed
but
brought
swift
and
terrible
suffering
to
those
who
were
and
are
absolutely
innocent
of
any
intent
against
the
government
as
well
as
to
the
adherents
of
the
government
it
is
easy
to
imagine
what
happened
when
hundreds
of
people
in
some
towns
thousands
were
herded
together
on
the
bare
ground
with
no
food
with
no
knowledge
of
sanitation
with
no
covering
for
their
heads
but
palm
leaves
with
no
privacy
for
the
women
and
young
girls
with
no
thought
but
as
to
how
they
could
live
until
it
is
true
that
in
the
country
also
these
people
had
no
covering
for
their
huts
but
palm
leaves
but
those
huts
were
made
stoutly
to
endure
when
a
man
built
one
of
them
he
was
building
his
home
not
a
shelter

and
they
were
placed
well
apart
from
one
another
with
the
free
air
of
the
plain
or

blowing
about
them
with
room
for
the
sun
to
beat
down
and

up
the
impurities
and
with
patches
of
green
things
growing
in
rows
over
the
few
acres

seen
them

that
all
over

could
have
sprung
from
houses
built
so
admirably
to
admit
the
sun
and
the
air
i
have
also
seen
them
i
might
add
in
parenthesis
rising
in
sluggish
columns
of
black
smoke
against
the
sky
hundreds
of
them
while
those
who
had
lived
in
them
for
years
stood
huddled
together
at
a
distance
watching
the
flames
run
over
the
dry
rafters
of
their
homes
roaring
and
crackling
with
delight
like
something
human
or
inhuman
and
marring
the
beautiful
sunlit
landscape
with
great
blotches
of
red
flames
the
huts
in
which
these
people
live
at
present
lean
one
against
the
other
and
there
are
no
broad
roads
nor
green
tobacco
patches
to
separate
one
from
another
there
are
on
the
contrary
only
narrow
paths
two
feet
wide
where
dogs
and
cattle
and
human
beings
tramp
over
daily
growing
heaps
of
refuse
and
garbage
and
filth
and
where
malaria
rises
at
night
in
a
white
winding
sheet
of
poisonous
mist
the
condition
of
these
people
differs
in
degree
some
are
living
the
life
of
gypsies
others
are
as
destitute
as
so
many
shipwrecked
emigrants
and
still
others
find
it
difficult
to
hold
up
their
heads
and
breathe
illustration
a
spanish
guerrilla
in
jaruco
in
the
havana
province
a
town
of
only
two
thousand
inhabitants
the
deaths
from
averaged
seven
a
day
for
the
month
of
december
and
while
frederic
remington
and
i
were
there
six
victims
of
were
carried
past
us
up
the
hill
to
the
burying
ground
in
the
space
of
twelve
hours
there
were
spanish
soldiers
as
well
as
pacificos
among
these
for
the
spanish
officers
either
know
or
care
nothing
about
the
health
of
their
men
there
is
no
attempt
made
to
police
these
military
camps
and
in
jaruco
the
filth
covered
the
streets
and
the
plaza
and
even
filled
the
corners
of
the
church
which
had
been
turned
into
a
fort
and
had
hammocks
swung
from
the
altars
the
huts
of
the
pac√≠ficos
with
from
four
to
six
people
in
each
were
jammed
together
in
rows
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
within
ten
feet
of
the
cavalry
barracks
where
sixty
men
and
horses
had
lived
for
a
month
next
to
the
stables
were
the
barracks
no
one
was
vaccinated
no
one
was
clean
and
all
of
them
were
living
on
half
rations
jaruco
was
a
little
worse
than
the
other
towns
but
i
found
that
the
condition
of
the
people
is
about
the
same
everywhere
around
every
town
and
even
around
the
forts
outside
of
the
towns
you
will
see
from
one
hundred
to
five
hundred
of
these
palm
huts
with
the
people
crouched
about
them
covered
with
rags
starving
with
no
chance
to
obtain
work
in
the
city
of
matanzas
the
huts
have
been
built
upon
a
hill
and
so
far
neither
nor
yellow
fever
has
made
headway
there
but
there
is
nothing
for
these
people
to
eat
either
and
while
i
was
there
three
babies
died
from
plain
starvation
and
no
other
cause
the
government
report
for
the
year
just
ended
gives
the
number
of
deaths
in
three
hospitals
of
matanzas
as
three
hundred
and
eighty
for
the
year
which
is
an
average
of
a
little
over
one
death
a
day
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
military
hospital
alone
the
soldiers
during
several
months
of
last
year
died
at
the
rate
of
sixteen
a
day
it
seems
hard
that
spain
should
hold
cuba
at
such
a
sacrifice
of
her
own
people
in
cardenas
one
of
the
principal
seaport
towns
of
the
island
i
found
the
pac√≠ficos
lodged
in
huts
at
the
back
of
the
town
and
also
in
abandoned
warehouses
along
the
water
front
the
condition
of
these
latter
was
so
pitiable
that
it
is
difficult
to
describe
it
correctly
and
hope
to
be
believed
the
warehouses
are
built
on
wooden
posts
about
fifty
feet
from
the
water
edge
they
were
originally
nearly
as
large
in
extent
as
madison
square
garden
but
the
half
of
the
roof
of
one
has
fallen
in
carrying
the
flooring
with
it
and
the
adobe
walls
and
one
side
of
the
sloping
roof
and
the
high
wooden
piles
on
which
half
of
the
floor
once
rested
are
all
that
remain
some
time
ago
an
unusually
high
tide
swept
in
under
one
of
these
warehouses
and
left
a
pool
of
water
a
hundred
yards
long
and
as
many
wide
around
the
wooden
posts
and
it
has
remained
there
undisturbed
this
pool
is
now
covered
a
thick
with
green
slime
colored
blue
and
yellow
and
with
a
damp
fungus
spread
over
the
wooden
posts
and
up
the
sides
of
the
walls
over
this
sewage
are
now
living
three
hundred
women
and
children
and
a
few
men
the
floor
beneath
them
has
rotted
away
and
the
planks
have
broken
and
fallen
into
the
pool
leaving
big
gaps
through
which
rise
day
and
night
deadly
stenches
and
poisonous
exhalations
from
the
pool
below
the
people
above
it
are
not
ignorant
of
their
situation
they
know
that
they
are
living
over
a
but
there
is
no
other
place
for
them
bands
of
guerrillas
and
flying
columns
have
driven
them
in
like
sheep
to
this
city
and
with
no
money
and
no
chance
to
obtain
work
they
have
taken
shelter
in
the
only
place
that
is
left
open
to
them
with
planks
and
blankets
and
bits
of
old
sheet
iron
they
have
for
the
sake
of
decency
put
up
barriers
across
these
abandoned
warehouses
and
there
they
are
now
sitting
on
the
floor
or
stretched
on
heaps
of
rags
gaunt
and
outside
in
the
angles
of
the
fallen
walls
and
among
the
refuse
of
the
warehouses
they
have
built
fireplaces
and
with
the
few
pots
and
kettles
they
use
in
common
they
cook
what
food
the
children
can
find
or
beg
one
gentleman
of
cardenas
told
me
that
a
hundred
of
these
people
called
at
his
house
every
day
for
a
bit
of
food
old
negroes
and
little
white
children
some
of
them
as
beautiful
in
spite
of
their
rags
as
any
children
i
ever
saw
act
as
providers
for
this
hapless
colony
they
beg
the
food
and
gather
the
sticks
and
do
the
cooking
inside
the
old
women
and
young
mothers
sit
on
the
rotten
planks
listless
and
silent
staring
ahead
of
them
at
nothing
i
saw
the
survivors
of
the
johnstown
flood
when
the
horror
of
that
disaster
was
still
plainly
written
in
their
eyes
but
destitute
as
they
were
of
home
and
food
and
clothing
they
were
in
better
plight
than
those
starving
pac√≠ficos
who
have
sinned
in
no
way
who
have
given
no
aid
to
the
rebels
and
whose
only
crime
is
that
they
lived
in
the
country
instead
of
in
the
town
they
are
now
to
suffer
because
general
weyler
finding
that
he
can
not
hold
the
country
as
he
can
the
towns
lays
it
waste
and
treats
those
who
lived
there
with
less
consideration
than
the
sultan
of
morocco
shows
to
the
murderers
in
his
jail
at
tangier
had
these
people
been
guilty
of
the
most
unnatural
crimes
their
punishment
could
not
have
been
more
severe
nor
their
end
more
certain
illustration
murdering
the
cuban
wounded
i
found
the
hospital
for
this
colony
behind
three
blankets
which
had
been
hung
across
a
corner
of
the
warehouse
a
young
woman
and
a
man
were
lying
side
by
side
the
girl
on
a
cot
and
the
man
on
the
floor
the
others
sat
within
a
few
feet
of
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
blankets
apparently
lost
to
all
sense
of
their
danger
and
too
dejected
and
hopeless
to
even
raise
their
eyes
when
i
gave
them
money
a
fat
little
doctor
was
caring
for
the
sick
woman
and
he
pointed
through
the
cracks
in
the
floor
at
the
green
slime
below
us
and
held
his
fingers
to
his
nose
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
asked
him
what
ailed
his
patients
and
he
said
it
was
yellow
fever
and
pointed
again
at
the
slime
which
moved
and
bubbled
in
the
hot
sun
he
showed
me
babies
with
the
skin
drawn
so
tightly
over
their
little
bodies
that
the
bones
showed
through
as
plainly
as
the
rings
under
a
glove
they
were
covered
with
sores
and
they
protested
as
loudly
as
they
could
against
the
treatment
which
the
world
was
giving
them
clinching
their
fists
and
sobbing
with
pain
when
the
sore
places
came
in
contact
with
their
mothers
arms
a
planter
who
had
at
one
time
employed
a
large
number
of
these
people
and
who
was
moving
about
among
them
said
that
five
hundred
had
died
in
cardenas
since
the
order
to
leave
the
fields
had
been
issued
another
gentleman
told
me
that
in
the
huts
at
the
back
of
the
town
there
had
been
cases
of
in
one
week
of
which
seventeen
had
resulted
in
death
i
do
not
know
that
the
united
states
will
interfere
in
the
affairs
of
cuba
but
whatever
may
happen
later
this
is
what
is
likely
to
happen
now
and
it
should
have
some
weight
in
helping
to
decide
the
question
with
those
whose
proper
business
it
is
to
determine
it
thousands
of
human
beings
are
now
herded
together
around
the
seaport
towns
of
cuba
who
can
not
be
fed
who
have
no
knowledge
of
cleanliness
or
sanitation
who
have
no
doctors
to
care
for
them
and
who
can
not
care
for
themselves
many
of
them
are
dying
of
sickness
and
some
of
starvation
and
this
is
the
healthy
season
in
april
and
may
the
rains
will
come
and
the
fever
will
thrive
and
spread
and
cholera
yellow
fever
and
will
turn
cuba
into
one
huge
plague
spot
and
the
farmers
sons
whom
spain
has
sent
over
here
to
be
soldiers
and
who
are
dying
by
the
dozens
before
they
have
learned
to
pull
the
comb
off
a
bunch
of
cartridges
are
going
to
die
by
the
hundreds
and
women
and
children
who
are
innocent
of
any
offense
will
die
with
them
and
there
will
be
a
quarantine
against
cuba
and
no
vessel
can
come
into
her
ports
or
leave
them
all
this
is
going
to
happen
i
am
led
to
believe
not
from
what
i
saw
in
any
one
village
but
in
hundreds
of
villages
it
will
not
do
to
put
it
aside
by
saying
that
war
is
war
and
that
all
war
is
cruel
or
to
ask
am
i
my
brother
keeper
in
other
wars
men
have
fought
with
men
and
women
have
suffered
indirectly
because
the
men
were
killed
but
in
this
war
it
is
the
women
herded
together
in
the
towns
like
cattle
who
are
going
to
die
while
the
men
camped
in
the
fields
and
the
mountains
will
live
it
is
a
situation
which
charity
might
help
to
better
but
in
any
event
it
is
a
condition
which
deserves
the
most
serious
consideration
from
men
of
common
sense
and
judgment
and
one
not
to
be
treated
with
hysterical
head
lines
nor
put
aside
as
a
necessary
evil

bringing
in
the
wounded
the
death
of
rodriguez
adolfo
rodr√≠guez
was
the
only
son
of
a
cuban
farmer
who
lives
nine
miles
outside
of
santa
clara
beyond
the
hills
that
surround
that
city
to
the
north
when
the
revolution
broke
out
young
rodr√≠guez
joined
the
insurgents
leaving
his
father
and
mother
and
two
sisters
at
the
farm
he
was
taken
in
december
of
by
a
force
of
the
guardia
civile
the
corps
of
the
spanish
army
and
defended
himself
when
they
tried
to
capture
him
wounding
three
of
them
with
his
machete
he
was
tried
by
a
military
court
for
bearing
arms
against
the
government
and
sentenced
to
be
shot
by
a
fusillade
some
morning
before
sunrise
previous
to
execution
he
was
confined
in
the
military
prison
of
santa
clara
with
thirty
other
insurgents
all
of
whom
were
sentenced
to
be
shot
one
after
the
other
on
mornings
following
the
execution
of
rodr√≠guez
his
execution
took
place
the
morning
of
the
of
january
at
a
place
a
distant
from
the
city
on
the
great
plain
that
stretches
from
the
forts
out
to
the
hills
beyond
which
rodr√≠guez
had
lived
for
nineteen
years
at
the
time
of
his
death
he
was
twenty
years
old
i
witnessed
his
execution
and
what
follows
is
an
account
of
the
way
he
went
to
death
the
young
man
friends
could
not
be
present
for
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
show
themselves
in
that
crowd
and
that
place
with
wisdom
or
without
distress
and
i
like
to
think
that
although
rodr√≠guez
could
not
know
it
there
was
one
person
present
when
he
died
who
felt
keenly
for
him
and
who
was
a
sympathetic
though
unwilling
spectator
there
had
been
a
full
moon
the
night
preceding
the
execution
and
when
the
squad
of
soldiers
marched
out
from
town
it
was
still
shining
brightly
through
the
mists
although
it
was
past
five
it
lighted
a
plain
two
miles
in
extent
broken
by
ridges
and
gullies
and
covered
with
thick
high
grass
and
with
bunches
of
cactus
and
palmetto
in
the
hollow
of
the
ridges
the
mist
lay
like
broad
lakes
of
water
and
on
one
side
of
the
plain
stood
the
walls
of
the
old
town
on
the
other
rose
hills
covered
with
royal
palms
that
showed
white
in
the
moonlight
like
hundreds
of
marble
columns
a
line
of
tiny
camp
fires
that
the
sentries
had
built
during
the
night
stretched
between
the
forts
at
regular
intervals
and
burned
brightly
but
as
the
light
grew
stronger
and
the
moonlight
faded
these
were
stamped
out
and
when
the
soldiers
came
in
force
the
moon
was
a
white
ball
in
the
sky
without
radiance
the
fires
had
sunk
to
ashes
and
the
sun
had
not
yet
risen
so
even
when
the
men
were
formed
into
three
sides
of
a
hollow
square
they
were
scarcely
able
to
distinguish
one
another
in
the
uncertain
light
of
the
morning
there
were
about
three
hundred
soldiers
in
the
formation
they
belonged
to
the
volunteers
and
they
deployed
upon
the
plain
with
their
band
in
front
playing
a
jaunty
quickstep
while
their
officers
galloped
from
one
side
to
the
other
through
the
grass
seeking
out
a
suitable
place
for
the
execution
while
the
band
outside
the
line
still
played
merrily
a
few
men
and
boys
who
had
been
dragged
out
of
their
beds
by
the
music
moved
about
the
ridges
behind
the
soldiers
unshaven
yawning
and
stretching
themselves
nervously
and
shivering
in
the
cool
damp
air
of
the
morning
either
owing
to
discipline
or
on
account
of
the
nature
of
their
errand
or
because
the
men
were
still
but
half
awake
there
was
no
talking
in
the
ranks
and
the
soldiers
stood
motionless
leaning
on
their
rifles
with
their
backs
turned
to
the
town
looking
out
across
the
plain
to
the
hills
the
men
in
the
crowd
behind
them
were
also
grimly
silent
they
knew
that
whatever
they
might
say
would
be
twisted
into
a
word
of
sympathy
for
the
condemned
man
or
a
protest
against
the
government
so
no
one
spoke
even
the
officers
gave
their
orders
in
gruff
whispers
and
the
men
in
the
crowd
did
not
mix
together
but
looked
suspiciously
at
one
another
and
kept
apart
as
the
light
increased
a
mass
of
people
came
hurrying
from
the
town
with
two
black
figures
leading
them
and
the
soldiers
drew
up
at
attention
and
part
of
the
double
line
fell
back
and
left
an
opening
in
the
square
with
us
a
condemned
man
walks
only
the
short
distance
from
his
cell
to
the
scaffold
or
the
electric
chair
shielded
from
sight
by
the
prison
walls
and
it
often
occurs
even
then
that
the
short
journey
is
too
much
for
his
strength
and
courage
illustration
young
spanish
officer
but
the
merciful
spaniards
on
this
morning
made
the
prisoner
walk
for
over
a
across
the
broken
surface
of
the
fields
i
expected
to
find
the
man
no
matter
what
his
strength
at
other
times
might
be
stumbling
and
faltering
on
this
cruel
journey
but
as
he
came
nearer
i
saw
that
he
led
all
the
others
that
the
priests
on
either
side
of
him
were
taking
two
steps
to
his
one
and
that
they
were
tripping
on
their
gowns
and
stumbling
over
the
hollows
in
their
efforts
to
keep
pace
with
him
as
he
walked
erect
and
soldierly
at
a
quick
step
in
advance
of
them
he
had
a
handsome
gentle
face
of
the
peasant
type
a
light
pointed
beard
great
wistful
eyes
and
a
mass
of
curly
black
hair
he
was
shockingly
young
for
such
a
sacrifice
and
looked
more
like
a
neapolitan
than
a
cuban
you
could
imagine
him
sitting
on
the
quay
at
naples
or
genoa
lolling
in
the
sun
and
showing
his
white
teeth
when
he
laughed
he
wore
a
new
scapula
around
his
neck
hanging
outside
his
linen
blouse
it
seems
a
petty
thing
to
have
been
pleased
with
at
such
a
time
but
i
confess
to
have
felt
a
thrill
of
satisfaction
when
i
saw
as
the
cuban
passed
me
that
he
held
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
not
arrogantly
nor
with
bravado
but
with
the
nonchalance
of
a
man
who
meets
his
punishment
fearlessly
and
who
will
let
his
enemies
see
that
they
can
kill
but
can
not
frighten
him
it
was
very
quickly
finished
with
rough
and
but
for
one
frightful
blunder
with
merciful
swiftness
the
crowd
fell
back
when
it
came
to
the
square
and
the
condemned
man
the
priests
and
the
firing
squad
of
six
young
volunteers
passed
in
and
the
line
closed
behind
them
the
officer
who
had
held
the
cord
that
bound
the
cuban
arms
behind
him
and
passed
across
his
breast
let
it
fall
on
the
grass
and
drew
his
sword
and
rodriguez
dropped
his
cigarette
from
his
lips
and
bent
and
kissed
the
cross
which
the
priest
held
up
before
him
the
elder
of
the
priests
moved
to
one
side
and
prayed
rapidly
in
a
loud
whisper
while
the
other
a
younger
man
walked
away
behind
the
firing
squad
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
turned
his
back
they
had
both
spent
the
last
twelve
hours
with
rodriguez
in
the
chapel
of
the
prison
the
cuban
walked
to
where
the
officer
directed
him
to
stand
and
turned
his
back
to
the
square
and
faced
the
hills
and
the
road
across
them
which
led
to
his
father
farm
as
the
officer
gave
the
first
command
he
straightened
himself
as
far
as
the
cords
would
allow
and
held
up
his
head
and
fixed
his
eyes
immovably
on
the
morning
light
which
had
just
begun
to
show
above
the
hills
he
made
a
picture
of
such
pathetic
helplessness
but
of
such
courage
and
dignity
that
he
reminded
me
on
the
instant
of
that
statue
of
nathan
hale
which
stands
in
the
city
hall
park
above
the
roar
of
broadway
and
teaches
a
lesson
daily
to
the
hurrying
crowds
of
moneymakers
who
pass
beneath
the
cuban
arms
were
bound
as
are
those
of
the
statue
and
he
stood
firmly
with
his
weight
resting
on
his
heels
like
a
soldier
on
parade
and
with
his
face
held
up
fearlessly
as
is
that
of
the
statue
but
there
was
this
difference
that
rodriguez
while
probably
as
willing
to
give
six
lives
for
his
country
as
was
the
american
rebel
being
only
a
peasant
did
not
think
to
say
so
and
he
will
not
in
consequence
live
in
bronze
during
the
lives
of
many
men
but
will
be
remembered
only
as
one
of
thirty
cubans
one
of
whom
was
shot
at
santa
clara
on
each
succeeding
day
at
sunrise
the
officer
had
given
the
order
the
men
had
raised
their
pieces
and
the
condemned
man
had
heard
the
clicks
of
the
triggers
as
they
were
pulled
back
and
he
had
not
moved
and
then
happened
one
of
the
most
cruelly
refined
though
unintentional
acts
of
torture
that
one
can
very
well
imagine
as
the
officer
slowly
raised
his
sword
preparatory
to
giving
the
signal
one
of
the
mounted
officers
rode
up
to
him
and
pointed
out
silently
what
i
had
already
observed
with
some
satisfaction
that
the
firing
squad
were
so
placed
that
when
they
fired
they
would
shoot
several
of
the
soldiers
stationed
on
the
extreme
end
of
the
square
their
captain
motioned
his
men
to
lower
their
pieces
and
then
walked
across
the
grass
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
waiting
prisoner
it
is
not
pleasant
to
think
what
that
shock
must
have
been
the
man
had
steeled
himself
to
receive
a
volley
of
bullets
in
his
back
he
believed
that
in
the
next
instant
he
would
be
in
another
world
he
had
heard
the
command
given
had
heard
the
click
of
the
mausers
as
the
locks
caught
and
then
at
that
supreme
moment
a
human
hand
had
been
laid
upon
his
shoulder
and
a
voice
spoke
in
his
ear
you
would
expect
that
any
man
who
had
been
snatched
back
to
life
in
such
a
fashion
would
start
and
tremble
at
the
reprieve
or
would
break
down
altogether
but
this
boy
turned
his
head
steadily
and
followed
with
his
eyes
the
direction
of
the
officer
sword
then
nodded
his
head
gravely
and
with
his
shoulders
squared
took
up
a
new
position
straightened
his
back
again
and
once
more
held
himself
erect
as
an
exhibition
of
this
should
surely
rank
above
feats
of
heroism
performed
in
battle
where
there
are
thousands
of
comrades
to
give
inspiration
this
man
was
alone
in
the
sight
of
the
hills
he
knew
with
only
enemies
about
him
with
no
source
to
draw
on
for
strength
but
that
which
lay
within
himself
illustration
the
cuban
martyrdom
the
officer
of
the
firing
squad
mortified
by
his
blunder
hastily
whipped
up
his
sword
the
men
once
more
leveled
their
rifles
the
sword
rose
dropped
and
the
men
fired
at
the
report
the
cuban
head
snapped
back
almost
between
his
shoulders
but
his
body
fell
slowly
as
though
some
one
had
pushed
him
gently
forward
from
behind
and
he
had
stumbled
he
sank
on
his
side
in
the
wet
grass
without
a
struggle
or
sound
and
did
not
move
again
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
he
meant
to
lie
there
that
it
could
be
ended
so
without
a
word
that
the
man
in
the
linen
suit
would
not
get
up
on
his
feet
and
continue
to
walk
on
over
the
hills
as
he
apparently
had
started
to
do
to
his
home
that
there
was
not
a
mistake
somewhere
or
that
at
least
some
one
would
be
sorry
or
say
something
or
run
to
pick
him
up
but
fortunately
he
did
not
need
help
and
the
priests
returned
the
younger
one
with
the
tears
running
down
his
face
and
donned
their
vestments
and
read
a
brief
requiem
for
his
soul
while
the
squad
stood
uncovered
and
the
men
in
hollow
square
shook
their
accoutrements
into
place
and
shifted
their
pieces
and
got
ready
for
the
order
to
march
and
the
band
began
again
with
the
same
quickstep
which
the
fusillade
had
interrupted
the
figure
still
lay
on
the
grass
untouched
and
no
one
seemed
to
remember
that
it
had
walked
there
of
itself
or
noticed
that
the
cigarette
still
burned
a
tiny
ring
of
living
fire
at
the
place
where
the
figure
had
first
stood
the
figure
was
a
thing
of
the
past
and
the
squad
shook
itself
like
a
great
snake
and
then
broke
into
little
pieces
and
started
off
jauntily
stumbling
in
the
high
grass
and
striving
to
keep
step
to
the
music
the
officers
led
it
past
the
figure
in
the
linen
suit
and
so
close
to
it
that
the
file
closers
had
to
part
with
the
column
to
avoid
treading
on
it
each
soldier
as
he
passed
turned
and
looked
down
on
it
some
craning
their
necks
curiously
others
giving
a
careless
glance
and
some
without
any
interest
at
all
as
they
would
have
looked
at
a
house
by
the
roadside
or
a
passing
cart
or
a
hole
in
the
road
one
young
soldier
caught
his
foot
in
a
trailing
vine
and
fell
forward
just
opposite
to
it
he
grew
very
red
when
his
comrades
giggled
at
him
for
his
awkwardness
the
crowd
of
sleepy
spectators
fell
in
on
either
side
of
the
band
they
had
forgotten
it
too
and
the
priests
put
their
vestments
back
in
the
bag
and
wrapped
their
heavy
cloaks
about
them
and
hurried
off
after
the
others
every
one
seemed
to
have
forgotten
it
except
two
men
who
came
slowly
toward
it
from
the
town
driving
a
bullock
cart
that
bore
an
unplaned
coffin
each
with
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
and
with
his
throat
wrapped
in
a
shawl
to
keep
out
the
morning
mists
at
that
moment
the
sun
which
had
shown
some
promise
of
its
coming
in
the
glow
above
the
hills
shot
up
suddenly
from
behind
them
in
all
the
splendor
of
the
tropics
a
fierce
red
disc
of
heat
and
filled
the
air
with
warmth
and
light
the
bayonets
of
the
retreating
column
flashed
in
it
and
at
the
sight
of
it
a
rooster
in
a
farmyard
near
by
crowed
vigorously
and
a
dozen
bugles
answered
the
challenge
with
the
brisk
cheery
notes
of
the
reveille
and
from
all
parts
of
the
city
the
church
bells
jangled
out
the
call
for
early
mass
and
the
whole
world
of
santa
clara
seemed
to
stir
and
stretch
itself
and
to
wake
to
welcome
the
day
just
begun
but
as
i
fell
in
at
the
rear
of
the
procession
and
looked
back
the
figure
of
the
young
cuban
who
was
no
longer
a
part
of
the
world
of
santa
clara
was
asleep
in
the
wet
grass
with
his
motionless
arms
still
tightly
bound
behind
him
with
the
scapula
twisted
awry
across
his
face
and
the
blood
from
his
breast
sinking
into
the
soil
he
had
tried
to
free
illustration
regular
cavalryman
spanish
along
the
trocha
this
is
an
account
of
a
voyage
of
discovery
along
the
spanish
trocha
the
one
at
the
eastern
end
of
cuba
it
is
the
longer
of
the
two
and
stretches
from
coast
to
coast
at
the
narrowest
part
of
that
half
of
the
island
from
jucaro
on
the
south
to
moron
on
the
north
before
i
came
to
cuba
this
time
i
had
read
in
our
newspapers
about
the
spanish
trocha
without
knowing
just
what
a
trocha
was
i
imagined
it
to
be
a
rampart
of
earth
and
fallen
trees
topped
with
barbed
wire
a
rubicon
that
no
one
was
allowed
to
pass
but
which
the
insurgents
apparently
crossed
at
will
with
the
ease
of
little
girls
leaping
over
a
flying
skipping
rope
in
reality
it
seems
to
be
a
much
more
important
piece
of
engineering
than
is
generally
supposed
and
one
which
when
completed
may
prove
an
absolute
barrier
to
the
progress
of
large
bodies
of
troops
unless
they
are
supplied
with
artillery
i
saw
of
its
fifty
miles
and
the
engineers
in
charge
told
me
that
i
was
the
first
american
or
foreigner
of
any
nationality
who
had
been
allowed
to
visit
it
and
make
drawings
and
photographs
of
it
why
they
allowed
me
to
see
it
i
do
not
know
nor
can
i
imagine
either
why
they
should
have
objected
to
my
doing
so
there
is
no
great
mystery
about
it
indeed
what
impressed
me
most
concerning
it
was
the
fact
that
every
bit
of
material
used
in
constructing
this
backbone
of
the
spanish
defence
this
strategic
point
of
all
their
operations
and
their
chief
hope
of
success
against
the
revolutionists
was
furnished
by
their
despised
and
hated
enemies
in
the
united
states
every
sheet
of
armor
plate
every
corrugated
zinc
roof
every
roll
of
barbed
wire
every
plank
beam
rafter
and
girder
even
the
nails
that
hold
the
planks
together
the
forts
themselves
shipped
in
sections
which
are
numbered
in
readiness
for
setting
up
the
ties
for
the
military
railroad
which
clings
to
the
trocha
from
one
sea
to
the
other
all
of
these
have
been
supplied
by
manufacturers
in
the
united
states
this
is
interesting
when
one
remembers
that
the
american
in
the
spanish
illustrated
papers
is
represented
as
a
hog
and
generally
with
the
united
states
flag
for
trousers
and
spain
as
a
noble
and
valiant
lion
yet
it
would
appear
that
the
lion
is
willing
to
save
a
few
dollars
on
freight
by
buying
his
armament
from
his
hoggish
neighbor
and
that
the
american
who
cheers
for
cuba
libre
is
not
at
all
averse
to
making
as
many
dollars
as
he
can
in
building
the
wall
against
which
the
cubans
may
be
eventually
driven
and
shot
if
the
insurgents
have
found
as
much
difficulty
in
crossing
the
trocha
by
land
as
i
found
in
reaching
it
by
water
they
are
deserving
of
all
sympathy
as
patient
and
individuals
a
thick
jungle
stretches
for
miles
on
either
side
of
the
trocha
and
the
only
way
of
reaching
it
from
the
outer
world
is
through
the
seaports
at
either
end
of
these
moron
is
all
but
landlocked
and
jucaro
is
guarded
by
a
chain
of
keys
which
make
it
necessary
to
reship
all
the
troops
and
their
supplies
and
all
the
material
for
the
trocha
to
lighters
which
meet
the
vessels
six
miles
out
at
sea
a
dirty
spanish
steamer
drifted
with
us
for
two
nights
and
a
day
from
cienfuegos
to
jucaro
and
three
hundred
spanish
soldiers
dusty
ragged
and
barefooted
owned
her
as
completely
as
though
she
had
been
a
regular
transport
they
sprawled
at
full
length
over
every
deck
their
guns
were
stacked
in
each
corner
and
their
hammocks
swung
four
deep
from
railings
and
riggings
and
across
companionways
and
even
from
the
bridge
itself
it
was
not
possible
to
take
a
step
without
treading
on
one
of
them
and
their
hammocks
made
a
walk
on
the
deck
something
like
a
hurdle
race
illustration
one
of
the
block
a
photograph
taken
by
davis
with
the
soldiers
and
crowding
them
for
space
were
the
mules
and
ponies
steers
calves
and
squealing
pigs
while
crates
full
of
chickens
were
piled
on
top
of
one
another
as
high
as
the
hurricane
deck
so
that
the
roosters
and
the
buglers
vied
with
each
other
in
continual
contests
it
was
like
traveling
with
a
floating
menagerie
twice
a
day
the
bugles
sounded
the
call
for
breakfast
and
dinner
and
the
soldiers
ceased
to
sprawl
and
squatted
on
the
deck
around
square
tin
cans
filled
with
soup
or
red
wine
from
which
they
fed
themselves
with
spoons
and
into
which
they
dipped
their
rations
of
hard
tack
after
first
breaking
them
on
the
deck
with
a
blow
from
a
bayonet
or
crushing
them
with
a
rifle
butt
the
steward
brought
what
was
supposed
to
be
a
sample
of
this
soup
to
the
officer
seated
in
the
pilot
house
high
above
the
squalor
and
he
would
pick
out
a
bean
from
the
mess
on
the
end
of
a
fork
and
place
it
to
his
lips
and
nod
his
head
gravely
and
the
grinning
steward
would
carry
the
dish
away
but
the
soldiers
seemed
to
enjoy
it
very
much
and
to
be
content
even
cheerful
there
are
many
things
to
admire
about
the
spanish
tommy
in
the
seven
fortified
cities
which
i
visited
where
there
were
thousands
of
him
i
never
saw
one
drunk
or
aggressive
which
is
much
more
than
you
can
say
of
his
officers
on
the
march
he
is
patient
eager
and
alert
he
trudges
from
fifteen
to
thirty
miles
a
day
over
the
worst
roads
ever
constructed
by
man
in
canvas
shoes
with
rope
soles
carrying
one
hundred
and
fifty
cartridges
fifty
across
his
stomach
and
one
hundred
on
his
back
weighing
in
all
fifty
pounds
with
these
he
has
his
mauser
his
blanket
and
an
extra
pair
of
shoes
and
as
many
tin
plates
and
bottles
and
bananas
and
potatoes
and
loaves
of
white
bread
as
he
can
stow
away
in
his
blouse
and
knapsack
and
this
under
a
sun
which
makes
even
a
walking
stick
seem
a
burden
in
spite
of
his
officers
and
not
on
account
of
them
he
maintains
good
discipline
and
no
matter
how
tired
he
may
be
or
how
much
he
may
wish
to
rest
on
his
plank
bed
he
will
always
struggle
to
his
feet
when
the
officers
pass
and
stand
at
salute
he
gets
very
little
in
return
for
his
efforts
one
sunday
night
when
the
band
was
playing
in
the
plaza
at
a
fever
camp
called
ciego
de
avila
a
group
of
soldiers
were
sitting
near
me
on
the
grass
enjoying
the
music
they
loitered
there
a
few
minutes
after
the
bugle
had
sounded
the
retreat
to
the
barracks
and
the
officer
of
the
day
found
them
when
they
stood
up
he
ordered
them
to
report
themselves
at
the
cartel
under
arrest
and
then
losing
all
control
of
himself
lashed
one
little
fellow
over
the
head
with
his
colonel
staff
while
the
boy
stood
with
his
eyes
shut
and
with
his
lips
pressed
together
but
holding
his
hand
at
salute
until
the
officer
stick
beat
it
down
these
soldiers
are
from
the
villages
and
towns
of
spain
some
of
them
are
not
more
than
seventeen
years
old
and
they
are
not
volunteers
they
do
not
care
whether
spain
owns
an
island
eighty
miles
from
the
united
states
or
loses
it
but
they
go
out
to
it
and
have
their
pay
stolen
and
are
put
to
building
earth
forts
and
stone
walls
and
die
of
fever
it
seems
a
poor
return
for
their
unconscious
patriotism
when
a
colonel
thrashes
one
of
them
as
though
he
were
a
dog
especially
as
he
knows
the
soldier
may
not
strike
back
the
second
night
out
the
ship
steward
showed
us
a
light
lying
low
in
the
water
and
told
us
that
was
jucaro
and
we
accepted
his
statement
and
went
over
the
side
into
an
open
boat
in
which
we
drifted
about
until
morning
while
the
colored
man
who
owned
the
boat
and
a
little
mulatto
boy
who
steered
it
quarreled
as
to
where
exactly
the
town
of
jucaro
might
be
they
brought
us
up
at
last
against
a
dark
shadow
of
a
house
built
on
wooden
posts
and
apparently
floating
in
the
water
this
was
the
town
of
jucaro
as
seen
at
that
hour
of
the
night
and
as
we
left
it
before
sunrise
the
next
morning
i
did
not
know
until
my
return
whether
i
had
slept
in
a
stationary
ark
or
on
the
end
of
a
wharf
illustration
spanish
photographs
taken
by
davis
we
found
four
other
men
sleeping
on
the
floor
in
the
room
assigned
us
and
outside
eating
by
a
smoking
candle
a
young
english
boy
who
looked
up
and
laughed
when
he
heard
us
speak
and
said
you
come
at
last
have
you
you
are
the
first
white
men
i
seen
since
i
came
here
that
twelve
months
ago
he
was
the
cable
operator
at
jucaro
and
he
sits
all
day
in
front
of
a
sheet
of
white
paper
and
watches
a
ray
of
light
play
across
an
imaginary
line
and
he
can
tell
by
its
quivering
so
he
says
all
that
is
going
on
all
over
the
world
outside
of
his
whitewashed
cable
office
is
the
landlocked
bay
filled
with
wooden
piles
to
keep
out
the
sharks
and
back
of
him
lies
the
village
of
jucaro
consisting
of
two
open
places
filled
with
green
slime
and
filth
and
thirty
huts
but
the
operator
said
that
what
with
fishing
and
bathing
and
and
lloyd
weekly
times
jucaro
was
quite
enjoyable
he
is
going
home
the
year
after
this
at
least
that
how
i
put
it
he
explained
my
contract
requires
me
to
stop
on
here
until
december
of
but
it
does
sound
so
long
if
you
say
year
after
this
does
it
he
had
had
the
yellow
fever
and
had
never
owing
to
the
war
been
outside
of
jucaro
still
he
added
i
seeing
the
world
and
i
always
wanted
to
visit
foreign
parts
as
one
of
the
few
clean
persons
i
met
in
cuba
and
the
only
contented
one
i
hope
the
cable
operator
at
jucaro
will
get
a
rise
in
salary
soon
and
some
day
see
more
of
foreign
parts
than
he
is
seeing
at
present
and
at
last
get
back
to
the
horse
shoe
at
the
corner
of
tottenham
court
road
and
oxford
street
sir
where
as
we
agreed
better
entertainment
is
to
be
had
on
saturday
night
than
anywhere
in
london
in
havana
general
weyler
had
given
me
a
pass
to
enter
fortified
places
which
except
for
the
authority
which
the
signature
implied
meant
nothing
as
all
the
cities
and
towns
in
cuba
are
fortified
and
any
one
can
visit
them
it
was
as
though
mayor
strong
had
given
a
man
a
permit
to
ride
in
all
the
cable
cars
attached
to
cables
it
was
not
intended
to
include
the
trocha
but
i
argued
that
if
a
trocha
was
not
a
fortified
place
nothing
else
was
and
i
persuaded
the
commandante
at
jucaro
to
take
that
view
of
it
and
to
vise
order
so
at
five
the
following
morning
a
box
car
with
wooden
planks
stretched
across
it
for
seats
carried
me
along
the
line
of
the
trocha
from
jucaro
to
ciego
the
chief
military
port
on
the
fortifications
and
consumed
five
hot
and
stifling
hours
in
covering
miles
illustration
one
of
the
forts
along
the
a
photograph
taken
by
davis
the
trocha
is
a
cleared
space
one
hundred
and
fifty
to
two
hundred
yards
wide
which
stretches
for
fifty
miles
through
what
is
apparently
an
impassable
jungle
the
trees
which
have
been
cut
down
in
clearing
this
passageway
have
been
piled
up
at
either
side
of
the
cleared
space
and
laid
in
parallel
rows
forming
a
barrier
of
tree
trunks
and
roots
and
branches
as
wide
as
broadway
and
higher
than
a
man
head
it
would
take
a
man
some
time
to
pick
his
way
over
these
barriers
and
a
horse
could
no
more
do
it
than
it
could
cross
a
jam
of
floating
logs
in
a
river
between
the
fallen
trees
lies
the
single
track
of
the
military
railroad
and
on
one
side
of
that
is
the
line
of
forts
and
a
few
feet
beyond
them
a
maze
of
barbed
wire
beyond
the
barbed
wire
again
is
he
other
barrier
of
fallen
trees
and
the
jungle
in
its
unfinished
state
this
is
not
an
insurmountable
barricade
gomez
crossed
it
last
november
by
daylight
with
six
hundred
men
and
with
but
the
loss
of
killed
and
as
many
wounded
it
would
be
more
difficult
and
in
a
few
months
without
the
aid
of
artillery
it
will
be
impossible
except
with
the
sacrifice
of
a
great
loss
of
life
the
forts
are
of
three
kinds
they
are
best
described
as
the
forts
the
block
houses
and
the
little
forts
a
big
fort
consists
of
two
stories
with
a
cellar
below
and
a
watch
tower
above
it
is
made
of
stone
and
adobe
and
is
painted
a
glaring
white
one
of
these
is
placed
at
intervals
of
every
half
mile
along
the
trocha
and
on
a
clear
day
the
sentry
in
the
watch
tower
of
each
can
see
three
forts
on
either
side
midway
between
the
big
forts
at
a
distance
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
each
is
a
block
house
of
two
stories
with
the
upper
story
of
wood
overhanging
the
lower
foundation
of
mud
these
are
placed
at
right
angles
to
the
railroad
instead
of
facing
it
as
do
the
forts
between
each
block
house
and
each
fort
are
three
little
forts
of
mud
and
planks
surrounded
by
a
ditch
they
look
something
like
a
ice
house
as
we
see
it
at
home
and
they
are
about
as
hot
inside
as
the
other
is
cold
they
hold
five
men
and
are
within
hailing
distance
of
one
another
back
of
them
are
three
rows
of
stout
wooden
stakes
with
barbed
wire
stretching
from
one
row
to
the
other
interlacing
and
crossing
and
running
in
and
out
above
and
below
like
an
intricate
cat
cradle
of
wire
one
can
judge
how
closely
knit
it
is
by
the
fact
that
to
every
twelve
yards
of
posts
there
are
four
hundred
and
fifty
yards
of
wire
fencing
the
forts
are
most
completely
equipped
in
their
way
but
twelve
men
in
the
jungle
would
find
it
quite
easy
to
keep
twelve
men
securely
imprisoned
in
one
of
them
for
an
indefinite
length
of
time
the
walls
are
about
twelve
feet
high
with
a
cellar
below
and
a
vault
above
the
cellar
the
roof
of
the
vault
forms
a
platform
around
which
the
four
walls
rise
to
the
height
of
a
man
shoulder
there
are
loopholes
for
rifles
in
the
sides
of
the
vault
and
where
the
platform
joins
the
walls
these
latter
allow
the
men
in
the
fort
to
fire
down
almost
directly
upon
the
head
of
any
one
who
comes
up
close
to
the
wall
of
the
fort
where
without
these
holes
in
the
floor
it
would
be
impossible
to
fire
on
him
except
by
leaning
far
over
the
rampart
above
the
platform
is
an
iron
or
zinc
roof
supported
by
iron
pillars
and
in
the
centre
of
this
is
the
watch
tower
the
only
approach
to
the
fort
is
by
a
movable
ladder
which
hangs
over
the
side
like
the
gangway
of
a
ship
of
war
and
can
be
raised
by
those
on
the
inside
by
means
of
a
rope
suspended
over
a
wheel
in
the
roof
the
opening
in
the
wall
at
the
head
of
the
ladder
is
closed
at
the
time
of
an
attack
by
an
iron
platform
to
which
the
ladder
leads
and
which
also
can
be
raised
by
a
pulley
in
october
of
the
spanish
hope
to
have
calcium
lights
placed
in
the
watch
towers
of
the
forts
with
sufficient
power
to
throw
a
searchlight
over
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
to
the
next
block
house
and
so
keep
the
trocha
as
well
lighted
as
broadway
from
one
end
to
the
other
as
a
further
protection
against
the
insurgents
the
spaniards
have
distributed
a
number
of
bombs
along
the
trocha
which
they
showed
with
great
pride
these
are
placed
at
those
points
along
the
trocha
where
the
jungle
is
less
thickly
grown
and
where
the
insurgents
might
be
expected
to
pass
each
bomb
is
fitted
with
an
explosive
cap
to
which
five
or
six
wires
are
attached
and
staked
down
on
the
ground
any
one
stumbling
over
one
of
these
wires
explodes
the
bomb
and
throws
a
charge
of
broken
iron
to
a
distance
of
fifty
feet
how
the
spaniards
are
going
to
prevent
stray
cattle
and
their
own
soldiers
from
wandering
into
these
it
is
difficult
to
understand
illustration
the
a
photograph
taken
by
davis
the
chief
engineer
in
charge
of
the
trocha
detailed
a
captain
to
take
me
over
it
and
to
show
me
all
that
there
was
to
see
the
officers
of
the
infantry
and
cavalry
stationed
at
ciego
objected
to
his
doing
this
but
he
said
he
has
a
pass
from
general
weyler
i
am
not
responsible
it
was
true
that
i
had
an
order
from
general
weyler
but
he
had
rendered
it
ineffective
by
having
me
followed
about
wherever
i
went
by
his
police
and
spies
they
sat
next
to
me
in
the
caf√©s
and
in
the
plazas
and
when
i
took
a
cab
they
called
the
next
one
on
the
line
and
trailed
after
mine
all
around
the
city
until
my
driver
would
become
alarmed
for
fear
he
too
was
suspected
of
something
and
would
take
me
back
to
the
hotel
i
had
gotten
rid
of
them
at
cienfuegos
by
purchasing
a
ticket
on
the
steamer
to
santiago
three
days
further
down
the
coast
and
then
dropping
off
in
the
night
at
the
trocha
so
while
i
was
visiting
it
i
expected
to
find
that
my
at
santiago
had
been
reported
and
word
sent
to
the
trocha
that
i
was
a
newspaper
correspondent
and
whenever
an
officer
spoke
to
the
one
who
was
showing
me
about
my
camera
appeared
to
grow
to
the
size
of
a
trunk
and
to
weigh
like
lead
and
i
felt
lonely
and
longed
for
the
company
of
the
cheerful
cable
operator
at
the
other
end
of
the
trocha
but
as
i
had
seen
gillette
in
secret
service
only
seventeen
times
before
leaving
new
york
i
knew
just
what
to
do
which
was
to
smoke
all
the
time
and
keep
cool
the
latter
requirement
was
somewhat
difficult
as
ciego
de
avila
is
a
hotter
place
than
richmond
indeed
i
can
only
imagine
one
place
hotter
than
ciego
and
i
have
not
been
there
ciego
was
an
interesting
town
during
every
day
of
the
last
rainy
season
an
average
of
thirty
soldiers
and
officers
died
there
of
yellow
fever
while
i
was
there
i
saw
two
soldiers
one
quite
an
old
man
drop
down
in
the
street
as
though
they
had
been
shot
and
lie
in
the
road
until
they
were
carried
to
the
yellow
fever
ward
of
the
hospital
under
the
black
oilskin
cloth
of
the
stretchers
there
was
a
very
smart
officers
club
at
ciego
well
supplied
with
a
bar
and
billiard
tables
which
i
made
some
excuse
for
not
entering
but
which
could
be
seen
through
its
open
doors
and
i
suggested
to
one
of
the
members
that
it
must
be
a
comfort
to
have
such
a
place
where
the
officers
might
go
after
their
day
march
on
the
mud
banks
of
the
trocha
and
where
they
could
bathe
and
be
cool
and
clean
he
said
there
were
no
baths
in
the
club
nor
anywhere
in
the
town
he
added
that
he
thought
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
have
them
the
bath
tub
is
the
dividing
line
between
savages
and
civilized
beings
and
when
i
learned
that
regiment
after
regiment
of
spanish
officers
and
gentlemen
have
been
stationed
in
that
town
and
it
was
the
dirtiest
hottest
and
dustiest
town
i
ever
visited
for
eighteen
months
and
none
of
them
had
wanted
a
bath
i
believed
from
that
moment
all
the
stories
i
had
heard
about
their
butcheries
and
atrocities
stories
which
i
had
verified
later
by
more
direct
evidence
from
a
military
point
of
view
the
trocha
impressed
me
as
a
weapon
which
could
be
made
to
cut
both
ways
what
the
spaniards
think
of
it
is
shown
by
the
caricature
which
appeared
lately
in
don
quixote
and
which
shows
the
united
states
represented
by
a
hog
and
the
insurgents
represented
by
a
negro
imprisoned
in
the
trocha
while
weyler
stands
ready
to
turn
the
spanish
lion
on
them
and
watch
it
gobble
them
up
it
would
be
unkind
were
spain
to
do
anything
so
inconsiderate
and
besides
the
united
states
is
rather
a
large
mouthful
even
without
the
insurgents
who
taken
alone
seem
to
have
given
the
lion
some
pangs
of
indigestion
if
the
trocha
were
situated
on
a
broad
plain
or
prairie
with
a
mile
of
clear
ground
on
either
side
of
it
where
troops
could
manoeuvre
and
which
would
prevent
the
enemy
from
stealing
up
to
it
unseen
it
might
be
a
useful
line
of
defence
but
at
present
along
its
entire
length
stretches
this
almost
impassable
barrier
of
jungle
now
suppose
the
troops
are
sent
at
short
notice
from
the
military
camps
along
the
line
to
protect
any
particular
point
not
less
than
a
thousand
soldiers
must
be
sent
forward
and
one
can
imagine
what
their
condition
would
be
were
they
forced
to
manoeuvre
in
a
space
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
broad
the
half
of
which
is
taken
up
with
barbed
wire
fences
fallen
trees
and
explosive
bomb
shells
only
two
hundred
at
the
most
could
find
shelter
in
the
forts
which
would
mean
that
eight
hundred
men
would
be
left
outside
the
breastworks
and
scattered
over
a
distance
of
a
half
mile
with
a
forest
on
both
sides
of
them
from
which
the
enemy
could
fire
volley
after
volley
into
their
ranks
protected
from
pursuit
not
only
by
the
jungle
but
by
the
walls
of
fallen
trees
which
the
spaniards
themselves
have
placed
there
a
trocha
in
an
open
plain
as
were
the
english
trochas
in
the
desert
around

makes
an
admirable
defence
when
a
few
men
are
forced
to
withstand
the
assault
of
a
great
many
but
fighting
behind
a
trocha
in
a
jungle
is
like
fighting
in
an
ambush
and
if
the
trocha
at
moron
is
ever
attacked

it
will
prove
to
be
a
valley
of
death

the
question
of
atrocities
one
of
the
questions
that
is
most
frequently
asked
of
those
who
have
been
in
cuba
is
how
much
truth
exists
in
the
reports
of
spanish
butcheries
it
is
safe
to
say
in
answer
to
this
that
while
the
report
of
a
particular
atrocity
may
not
be
true
other
atrocities
just
as
horrible
have
occurred
and
nothing
has
been
heard
of
them
i
was
somewhat
skeptical
of
spanish
atrocities
until
i
came
to
cuba
chiefly
because
i
had
been
kept
sufficiently
long
in
key
west
to
learn
how
large
a
proportion
of
cuban
war
news
is
manufactured
on
the
piazzas
of
the
hotels
of
that
town
and
of
tampa
by
utterly
irresponsible
newspaper
men
who
accept
every
rumor
that
finds
its
way
across
the
gulf
and
pass
these
rumors
on
to
some
of
the
new
york
papers
as
facts
coming
direct
from
the
field
it
is
not
surprising
that
one
becomes
skeptical
for
if
one
story
proves
to
be
false
how
is
the
reader
to
know
that
the
others
are
not
inventions
also
it
is
difficult
to
believe
for
instance
the
account
of
a
horrible
butchery
if
you
read
in
the
paragraph
above
it
that
two
correspondents
have
been
taken
prisoners
by
the
spanish
when
both
of
these
gentlemen
are
sitting
beside
you
in
key
west
and
are
to
your
certain
knowledge
reading
the
paragraph
over
your
shoulder
nor
is
it
unnatural
that
one
should
grow
doubtful
of
reported
cuban
victories
if
he
reads
of
the
taking
of
santa
clara
and
the
flight
of
the
spanish
garrison
from
that
city
when
he
is
living
at
santa
clara
and
can
not
find
a
cuban
in
it
with
sufficient
temerity
to
assist
him
to
get
out
of
it
through
the
spanish
lines
but
because
a
jacksonville
correspondent
has
invented
the
tale
of
one
butchery
it
is
no
reason
why
the
people
in
the
united
states
should
dismiss
all
the
others
as
sensational
fictions
after
i
went
to
cuba
i
refused
for
weeks
to
listen
to
tales
of
butcheries
because
i
did
not
believe
in
them
and
because
there
seemed
to
be
no
way
of
verifying
them
those
who
had
been
butchered
could
not
testify
and
their
relatives
were
too
fearful
of
the
vengeance
of
the
spaniards
to
talk
about
what
had
befallen
a
brother
or
a
father
but
towards
the
end
of
my
visit
i
went
to
sagua
la
grande
and
there
met
a
number
of
americans
and
englishmen
concerning
whose
veracity
there
could
be
no
question
what
had
happened
to
their
friends
and
the
laborers
on
their
plantations
was
exactly
what
had
happened
and
is
happening
to
other
pacificos
all
over
the
island
sagua
la
grande
is
probably
no
worse
a
city
than
others
in
cuba
but
it
has
been
rendered
notorious
by
the
presence
in
that
city
of
the
guerrilla
chieftain
benito
cerreros
early
in
last
december
illustrated
published
reproductions
of
two
photographs
which
were
taken
in
sagua
one
was
a
picture
of
the
bodies
of
six
cuban
pacificos
lying
on
their
backs
with
their
arms
and
legs
bound
and
their
bodies
showing
mutilation
by
machetes
and
their
faces
pounded
and
hacked
out
of
resemblance
to
anything
human
the
other
picture
was
of
a
group
of
spanish
guerrillas
surrounding
their
leader
a
little
man
with
a
heavy
mustache
his
face
was
quite
as
inhuman
as
the
face
of
any
of
the
dead
men
he
had
mutilated
it
wore
a
satisfied
smile
of
fatuous
vanity
and
of
the
most
diabolical
cruelty
no
artist
could
have
drawn
a
face
from
his
imagination
which
would
have
been
more
cruel
the
letter
press
accompanying
these
photographs
explained
that
this
guerrilla
leader
benito
cerreros
had
found
six
unarmed
pacificos
working
in
a
field
near
sagua
and
had
murdered
them
and
then
brought
their
bodies
in
a
cart
to
that
town
and
had
paid
the
local
photographer
to
take
a
picture
of
them
and
of
himself
and
his
body
guard
he
claimed
that
he
had
killed
the
cubans
in
open
battle
but
was
so
stupid
as
to
forget
to
first
remove
the
ropes
with
which
he
had
bound
them
before
he
shot
them
the
photographs
told
the
story
without
any
aid
from
the
letter
press
and
it
must
have
told
it
to
a
great
many
people
judging
from
the
number
who
spoke
of
it
it
seemed
as
if
for
the
first
time
something
definite
regarding
the
reported
spanish
atrocities
had
been
placed
before
the
people
of
the
united
states
which
they
could
see
for
themselves
i
had
this
photograph
in
my
mind
when
i
came
to
sagua
and
on
the
night
that
i
arrived
there
by
a
coincidence
the
townspeople
were
giving
cerreros
a
dinner
to
celebrate
a
fresh
victory
of
his
over
two
insurgents
a
naturalized
american
and
a
native
cuban
the
american
was
visiting
the
cuban
in
the
field
and
they
were
lying
in
hiding
outside
of
the
town
in
a
hut
the
cuban
who
was
a
colonel
in
the
insurgent
army
had
captured
a
spanish
spy
but
had
given
him
his
liberty
on
the
condition
that
he
would
go
into
sagua
and
bring
back
some
medicines
the
colonel
was
dying
of
consumption
but
he
hoped
that
with
proper
medicine
he
might
remain
alive
a
few
months
longer
the
spy
instead
of
keeping
his
word
betrayed
the
hiding
place
of
the
cuban
and
the
american
to
cerreros
who
rode
out
by
night
to
surprise
them
he
took
with
him
guerrillas
and
lest
that
might
not
be
enough
to
protect
him
from
two
men
added
twelve
of
the
guarda
civile
to
their
number
making
men
in
all
they
surrounded
the
hut
in
which
the
cuban
and
the
american
were
concealed
and
shot
them
through
the
window
as
they
sat
at
a
table
in
the
light
of
a
candle
they
then
hacked
the
bodies
with
machetes
it
was
in
recognition
of
this
victory
that
the
banquet
was
tendered
to
cerreros
by
admiring
friends
illustration
amateur
surgery
in

civilized
nations
recognize
but
three
methods
of
dealing
with
prisoners
captured
in
war
they
are
either
paroled
or
exchanged
or
put
in
prison
that
is
what
was
done
with
them
in
our
rebellion
it
is
not
allowable
to
shoot
prisoners
at
least
it
is
not
generally
done
when
they
are
seated
unconscious
of
danger
at
a
table
it
may
be
said
however
that
as
these
two
men
were
in
arms
against
the
government
they
were
only
suffering
the
punishment
of
their
crime
and
that
this
is
not
a
good
instance
of
an
atrocity
there
are
however
unfortunately
many
other
instances
in
which
the
victims
were
and
their
death
simply
murder
but
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
tell
convincingly
of
these
cases
without
giving
names
and
the
giving
of
names
might
lead
to
more
deaths
in
sagua
it
is
also
difficult
to
convince
the
reader
of
murders
for
which
there
seems
to
have
been
no
possible
object
and
yet
cerreros
and
other
guerrillas
are
murdering
men
and
boys
in
the
fields
around
sagua
as
wantonly
and
as
calmly
as
a
gardener
cuts
down
weeds
the
stories
of
these
butcheries
were
told
to
me
by
englishmen
and
americans
who
could
look
from
their
verandas
over
miles
of
fields
that
belonged
to
them
but
who
could
not
venture
with
safety
two
hundred
yards
from
their
doorsteps
they
were
virtually
prisoners
in
their
own
homes
and
every
spot
of
ground
within
sight
of
their
windows
marked
where
one
of
their
laborers
had
been
cut
down
sometimes
when
he
was
going
to
the
next
on
an
errand
or
to
carry
the
mail
and
sometimes
when
he
was
digging
potatoes
or
cutting
sugar
cane
within
sight
of
the
forts
passes
and
orders
were
of
no
avail
the
guerrillas
tore
up
the
passes
and
swore
later
that
the
men
were
suspects
and
were
at
the
moment
of
their
capture
carrying
messages
to
the
insurgents
the
stories
these
planters
told
me
were
not
dragged
from
them
to
furnish
copy
for
a
newspaper
but
came
out
in
the
course
of
our
talk
as
we
walked
over
the
small
extent
which
the
forts
allowed
us
my
host
would
say
pointing
to
one
of
the
pacificos
huddled
in
a
corner
of
his
machine
shop
that
man
brother
was
killed
last
week
about
three
hundred
yards
over
there
to
the
left
while
he
was
digging
in
the
field
or
in
answer
to
a
question
from
our
consul
he
would
say
oh
that
boy
who
used
to
take
care
of
your
horse
some
guerrillas
shot
him
a
month
ago
after
you
hear
stories
like
these
during
an
entire
day
the
air
seems
to
be
heavy
with
murder
and
the
very
ground
on
which
you
walk
smells
of
blood
it
was
the
same
in
the
town
where
any
one
was
free
to
visit
the
and
view
the
murdered
bodies
of
the
pac√≠ficos
hacked
and
beaten
and
stretched
out
as
a
warning
or
for
public
approbation
there
were
six
so
exposed
while
i
was
in
sagua
in
matanzas
they
brought
the
bodies
to
the
plaza
at
night
when
the
band
was
playing
and
the
guerrillas
marched
around
the
open
place
with
the
bodies
of
eighteen
cubans
swinging
from
the
backs
of
ponies
with
their
heads
hanging
down
and
bumping
against
the
horses
knees
the
people
flocked
to
the
sides
of
the
plaza
to
applaud
this
ghastly
procession
and
the
men
in
the
open
caf√©s
cheered
the
guerrilla
chief
and
cried
long
live
spain
speaking
dispassionately
and
with
a
full
knowledge
of
the
details
of
many
butcheries
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
think
of
the
spanish
guerrillas
otherwise
than
as
worse
than
savage
animals
a
wild
animal
kills
to
obtain
food
and
not
merely
for
the
joy
of
killing
these
guerrillas
murder
and
then
laugh
over
it
the
cannibal

has
been
supposed
hitherto
to
be
the
lowest

really
of

caste

these

vanity

they
may
pose
as
brave
soldiers
and
that
their
friends
may
give
them
banquets
in
hotel
parlors
if
what
i
say
seems
prejudiced
and
extravagant
it
may
be
well
to
insert
this
translation
from
a
spanish
paper
there
are

of
civilization

but
the
truth
is
that
we
are
uncultured
barbaric
and
cruel
although
this
may
not
be
willingly
acknowledged
the
fact
is
that
we
are
committing
acts

savagery

which

island
i
happened
to
sit
next
to
this
young
lady
at
table
on
the
steamer
and
i
found
that
she
was
not
an
amazon
nor
a
joan
of
arc
nor
a
woman
of
the
people
with
a
machete
in
one
hand
and
a
cuban
flag
in
the
other
she
was
a
young
person
speaking
three
languages
this
is
what
the
spaniards
did
to
these
girls
after
ordering
them
to
leave
the
island
on
a
certain
day
they
sent
detectives
to
the
houses
of
each
on
the
morning
of
that
day
and
had
them
undressed
and
searched
by
a
female
detective
to
discover
if
they
were
carrying
letters
to
the
junta
at
key
west
or
tampa
they
were
searched
thoroughly
even
to
the
length
of
taking
off
their
shoes
and
stockings
later
when
the
young
ladies
stood
at
last
on
the
deck
of
an
american
vessel
with
the
american
flag
hanging
from
the
stern
the
spanish
officers
followed
them
there
and
demanded
that
a
cabin
should
be
furnished
them
to
which
the
girls
might
be
taken
and
they
were
then
again
undressed
and
searched
by
this
woman
for
the
second
time
for
the
benefit
of
people
with
unruly
imaginations
of
whom
there
seem
to
be
a
larger
proportion
in
this
country
than
i
had
supposed
i
will
state
again
that
the
search
of
these
women
was
conducted
by
women
and
not
by
men
as
i
was
reported
to
have
said
and
as
i
did
not
say
in
my
original
report
of
the
incident
spanish
officers
with
red
crosses
for
bravery
on
their
chests
and
gold
lace
on
their
cuffs
strutted
up
and
down
while
the
search
was
going
on
and
chancing
to
find
a
cuban
suspect
among
the
passengers
ordered
him
to
be
searched
also
only
they
did
not
give
him
the
privacy
of
a
cabin
but
searched
his
clothes
and
shoes
and
hat
on
the
main
deck
of
this
american
vessel
before
the
other
passengers
and
myself
and
the
ship
captain
and
his
crew
in
order
to
leave
havana
it
is
first
necessary
to
give
notice
of
your
wish
to
do
so
by
sending
your
passport
to
the
captain
general
who
looks
up
your
record
and
after
hours
if
he
is
willing
to
let
you
go
vis√©s
your
passport
and
so
signifies
that
your
request
is
granted
after
you
have
complied
with
that
requirement
of
martial
law
and
the
captain
general
has
agreed
to
let
you
depart
and
you
are
on
board
of
an
american
vessel
the
spanish
soldiers
control
over
you
and
your
movements
should
cease
for
they
relinquish
all
their
rights
when
they
give
you
back
your
passport
at
least
the
case
of
barrundia
justifies
such
a
supposition
it
was
then
shown
that
while
a
passenger
or
a
member
of
a
crew
is
amenable
to
the
common
laws
of
the
country
in
the
port
in
which
the
vessel
lies
he
is
not
to
be
disturbed
for
political
offenses
against
her
government
when
the
officers
of
guatemala
went
on
board
a
vessel
of
the
pacific
mail
line
and
arrested
barrundia
who
was
a
revolutionist
and
then
shot
him
between
decks
the
american
minister
who
had
permitted
this
outrage
was
immediately
recalled
and
the
letter
recalling
him
which
was
written
by
james
blaine
clearly
and
emphatically
sets
forth
the
principle
that
a
political
offender
is
not
to
be
molested
on
board
of
an
american
vessel
whether
she
is
in
the
passenger
trade
or
a
ship
of
war
joseph
beale
the
professor
of
international
law
at
harvard
said
in
reference
to
the
case
of
these
women
when
i
first
wrote
of
it
so
long
as
a
state
of
war
has
not
been
recognized
by
this
country
the
spanish
government
has
not
the
right
to
stop
or
search
our
vessels
on
the
high
seas
for
contraband
of
war
or
for
any
other
purpose
nor
would
it
have
the
right
to
subject
american
citizens
or
an
american
vessel
in
cuban
waters
to
treatment
which
would
not
be
legal
in
the
case
of
spanish
citizens
or
vessels
but
the
spanish
government
has
the
right
in
cuba
to
execute
upon
american
citizens
or
vessels
any
laws
prevailing
there
in
the
same
way
as
they
would
execute
them
upon
the
spaniards
unless
they
are
prevented
by
the
provisions
of
some
treaty
with
the
united
states
the
fact
that
the
vessel
in
the
harbor
of
havana
was
flying
a
neutral
flag
could
not
protect
it
from
the
execution
of
spanish
law
however
unwise
or
inhuman
the
action
of
the
spanish
authorities
may
have
been
in
searching
the
women
on
board
the
they
appear
to
have
been
within
their
legal
rights
illustration
a
spanish
picket
post
the
spanish
minister
at
washington
has
also
declared
that
his
government
has
the
right
of
search
in
the
harbor
of
havana
hence
in
the
face
of
two
such
authorities
the
question
raised
is
probably
answered
from
a
legal
point
of
view
but
if
that
is
the
law
it
would
seem
well
to
alter
it
for
it
gives
the
spanish
authorities
absolute
control
over
the
persons
and
property
of
americans
on
american
vessels
and
that
privilege
in
the
hands
of
persons
as
unscrupulous
and
as
insolent
as
are
the
spanish
detectives
is
a
dangerous
one
so
dangerous
a
privilege
indeed
that
there
is
no
reason
nor
excuse
for
not
keeping
an
american
ship
of
war
in
the
harbor
of
havana
for
suppose
that
letters
and
despatches
had
been
found
on
the
persons
of
these
young
ladies
and
they
had
been
put
on
shore
and
lodged
in
prison
or
suppose
the
whole
ship
and
every
one
on
board
had
been
searched
as
the
captain
of
the
said
the
spanish
officers
told
him
they
might
decide
to
do
and
letters
had
been
found
on
the
americans
and
they
had
been
ordered
over
the
side
and
put
into
prison
would
that
have
been
an
act
derogatory
to
the
dignity
of
the
united
states
or
are
we
to
understand
that
an
american
citizen
or
a
citizen
of
any
country
after
he
has
asked
and
obtained
permission
to
leave
cuba
and
is
on
board
of
an
american
vessel
is
no
more
safe
there
than
he
would
be
in
the
insurgent
camp
the
latter
supposition
would
seem
to
be
correct
and
the
matter
to
depend
on
the
captain
of
the
vessel
and
her
owners
from
whom
he
receives
his
instructions
and
not
to
be
one
in
which
the
united
states
government
is
in
any
way
concerned
i
do
not
believe
the
captain
of
a
british
passenger
steamer
would
have
allowed
one
of
his
passengers
to
be
searched
on
the
main
deck
of
his
vessel
as
i
saw
this
cuban
searched
nor
even
the
captain
of
a
british
tramp
steamer
nor
of
a
coal
barge
the
chief
engineer
of
the
declared
to
me
that
in
his
opinion
it
served
them
just
right
and
the
captain
put
a
cabin
at
the
disposal
of
the
spanish
spies
with
eager
humility
and
when
one
of
the
detectives
showed
some
disinclination
to
give
back
my
passport
and
i
said
i
would
keep
him
on
board
until
he
did
it
the
captain
said
yes
you
will
will
you
i
would
like
to
see
you
try
it
suggesting
that
he
was
master
of
his
own
ship
and
of
my
actions
but
he
was
not
there
is
not
an
unwashed
garlicky
bediamonded
spanish
spy
in

who
has
not
more
authority
on

than
her
american
captain
and
his
subservient
crew
only
a
year
ago
half
of
this
country
was
clamoring
for
a
war
with
the
greatest
power
it
could
have
selected
for
that
purpose
yet
great
britain
would
have
been
the
first
to
protect
her
citizens
and
their
property
and
their
if
they
had
been
abused
as
the
and
property
and
freedom
of
americans
have
been
abused
by
this
power
and
are
being
abused
before
i
went
to
cuba
i
was
as
much
opposed
to
our
interfering
there
as
any
other
person
equally
ignorant
concerning
the
situation
could
be
but
since
i
have
seen
for
myself
i
feel
ashamed
that
we
should
have
stood
so
long
idle
we
have
been
too
considerate
too
fearful
that
as
a
younger

we
should
appear

down
by
older

we
have
tolerated
what

tolerated

put
back

with

right

are

to
justify

it
is

some

these
would
seem

why
should

go
a
step
farther
and
a
step
higher

interfere
in
the

not
because

because
we
are
human
beings
and
because
within
eighty

spanish

are
killing
men

women
as
wantonly
as

manifest
and
it
is

her

is
extinct

for
all
purposes
of
its
rightful
existence
and
when
a
hopeless
struggle
for
its
has
degenerated
into

which
is
nothing
more
than
the
useless
sacrifice
of
human
life
and
the
utter
destruction
of
the
very
of

conflict
a
situation
will
be
presented
in
which
our
obligations
to
the
sovereignty
of
spain
will
be
superseded
by
higher
obligations
which
we
can
hardly
hesitate
to
recognize
and
discharge
these
conditions
are
now
manifest
a
hopeless
struggle
for
sovereignty
has
degenerated
into

but
the
wanton
sacrifice
of
human

and
the
utter
destruction
of
the
of

what
further

are
needed

it
that

their

comes

all

the
condition
in
cuba
insurgents
and
spaniards
alike
are
laying
waste
the
land
and
neither
side
shows
any
sign
of
giving
up
the
struggle
but
while
the
men
are
in
the
field
fighting
after
their
fashion
for
the
independence
of
the
island
the
old
men
and
the
infirm
and
the
women
and
children
who
can
not
help
the
cause
or
themselves
and
who
are
destitute
and
starving
and
dying
have
their
eyes
turned
toward
the
great
republic
that
lies
only
eighty
miles
away
and
they
are
holding
out
their
hands
and
asking
how
long
o
lord
how
long
or
if
the
members
of
the
senate
and
of
congress
can
not
visit
cuba
why
will
they
not
listen
to
those
who
have
been
there
of
three
men
who
traveled
over
the
island
seeking
the
facts
concerning
it
two
correspondents
and
an
interpreter
two
of
the
three
were
for
a
time
in
spanish
hospitals
covered
with
of
the
three
although
we
were
together
until
they
were
taken
ill
i
was
the
only
one
who
escaped
contagion
if
these
other
men
should
die
they
die
because
they
tried
to
find
out
the
truth
is
it
likely
having
risked
such
a
price
for
it
that
they
would
lie
about
what
they
have
seen
they
could
have
invented
stories
of
famine
and
disease
in
havana
they
need
not
have
looked
for
the
facts
where
they
were
to
be
found
in
the
seaports
and
villages
and
fever
camps
why
not
listen
to
these
men
or
to
stephen
bonsai
of
the
york
in
whom
the
late
president
showed
his
confidence
by
appointing
him
to
two
diplomatic
missions
why
not
listen
to
akers
of
the
and
who
has
held
two
commissions
from
the
queen
why
disregard
a
dozen
other
correspondents
who
are
seeking
the
truth
and
who
urge
in
every
letter
which
they
write
that
their
country
should
stop
this
destruction
of
a
beautiful
land
and
this
butchery
of
harmless
the
matter
lies
at
the
door
of
congress
each
day
delay
means
the
death
of
hundreds
of
people
every
hour
sees
fresh
blood
spilled
and
more
houses
and
more
acres
of
crops
sinking
into
ashes
a
month
delay
means
the
loss
to
this
world
of
thousands
of
lives
the
unchecked
growth
of
terrible
diseases
and
the
spreading
devastation
of
a
great
plague
illustration
for
cuba
libre
it
would
be
an
insult
to
urge
political
reasons
or
the
sure
approval
of
the
american
people
which
the
act
of
interference
would
bring
or
any
other
unworthy
motive
no
european
power
dare
interfere
and
it
lies
with
the
united
states
and
with
her
people
to
give
the
signal
if
it
is
given
now
it
will
save
thousands
of
innocent
lives
if
it
is
delayed
just
that
many
people
will
perish
the
end
