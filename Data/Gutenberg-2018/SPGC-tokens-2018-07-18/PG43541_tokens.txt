preface
the
first
portion
of
this
book
was
written
at
intervals
between
and
during
my
tenure
of
the
post
of
her
majesty
minister
at
bangkok
i
had
but
recently
left
japan
after
a
residence
extending
with
two
seasons
of
home
leave
from
september
to
the
last
days
of
december
and
my
recollection
of
what
had
occurred
during
any
part
of
those
twenty
years
was
still
quite
fresh
a
diary
kept
almost
uninterruptedly
from
the
day
i
quitted
home
in
november
constituted
the
foundation
while
my
memory
enabled
me
to
supply
additional
details
it
had
never
been
my
purpose
to
relate
my
diplomatic
experiences
in
different
parts
of
the
world
which
came
finally
to
be
spread
over
a
period
of
altogether
years
and
i
therefore
confined
myself
to
one
of
the
most
interesting
episodes
in
which
i
have
been
concerned
this
comprised
the
series
of
events
that
culminated
in
the
restoration
of
the
direct
rule
of
the
ancient
line
of
sovereigns
of
japan
which
had
remained
in
abeyance
for
over
six
hundred
years
such
a
change
involved
the
substitution
of
the
comparatively
modern
city
of
yedo
under
the
name
of
tôkiô
for
the
more
ancient
kiôto
which
had
already
become
the
capital
long
before
japan
was
heard
of
in
the
western
world
when
i
departed
from
siam
in
i
laid
the
unfinished
manuscript
aside
and
did
not
look
at
it
again
until
september
when
some
of
my
younger
relations
to
whom
i
had
shown
it
suggested
that
it
ought
to
be
completed
this
second
portion
is
largely
a
transcript
of
my
journals
supplemented
from
papers
drawn
up
by
me
which
were
included
in
the
confidential
print
of
the
time
and
by
letters
to
my
chief
sir
harry
parkes
which
have
been
published
elsewhere
letters
to
my
mother

some
particulars
that
were

appointment
as
student
interpreter
at
yedo
my
thoughts
were
first
drawn
to
japan
by
a
mere
accident
in
my
eighteenth
year
an
elder
brother
brought
home
from
mudie
library
the
interesting
account
of
lord
elgin
mission
to
china
and
japan
by
lawrence
oliphant
and
the
book
having
fallen
to
me
in
turn
inflamed
my
imagination
with
pictures
verbal
and
coloured
of
a
country
where
the
sky
was
always
blue
where
the
sun
shone
perpetually
and
where
the
whole
duty
of
man
seemed
to
consist
in
lying
on
a
matted
floor
with
the
windows
open
to
the
ground
towards
a
miniature
rockwork
garden
in
the
company
of
and
attentive
damsels
in
short
a
realised
fairyland
but
that
i
should
ever
have
a
chance
of
seeing
these
isles
of
the
blest
was
beyond
my
wildest
dreams
an
account
of
commodore
perry
expedition
which
had
preceded
lord
elgin
mission
came
in
my
way
shortly
afterwards
and
though
much
more
sober
in
its
outward
appearance
and
literary
style
only
served
to
confirm
the
previous
impression
i
thought
of
nothing
else
from
that
time
onwards
one
day
on
entering
the
library
of
university
college
london
where
i
was
then
studying
i
found
lying
on
the
table
a
notice
that
three
nominations
to
in
china
and
japan
had
been
placed
at
the
disposition
of
the
dean
here
was
the
chance
for
which
i
had
been
longing
permission
to
enter
myself
for
the
competition
was
obtained
not
without
difficulty
from
my
parents
and
having
gained
the
first
place
in
the
public
examination
i
chose
japan
to
china
i
never
wished
or
intended
to
go
my
age
was
sufficient
by
a
few
hours
to
enable
me
to
compete
i
was
formally
appointed
in
august
and
quitted
england
full
of
joyful
anticipation
in
november
of
that
year
owing
to
the
prevalence
of
a
belief
among
those
who
then
had
the
direction
of
our
affairs
in
japan
that
a
knowledge
of
chinese
was
a
necessary
preliminary
to
the
study
of
japanese
my
jamieson
and
myself
were
at
first
stationed
for
a
few
months
at
peking
where
we
were
joined
early
in
by
russell
robertson
who
also
belonged
to
the
japan
establishment
i
pass
over
our
sojourn
there
which
though
not
without
its
own
interest
was
not
long
enough
for
me
to
gain
any
useful
knowledge
of
china
but
i
learnt
a
few
hundred
chinese
characters
which
were
of
great
help
to
me
afterwards
and
i
even
began
the
study
of
manchu
our
stay
at
the
chinese
capital
was
suddenly
cut
short
by
the
arrival
of
a
despatch
from
yedo
containing
the
original
text
of
a
note
from
the
japanese
ministers
which
it
was
found
no
chinaman
could
decipher
much
less
understand
this
was
decisive
of
the
question
whether
the
short
cut
to
japanese
lay
through
the
chinese
language
i
thought
then
and
still
think
that
though
an
acquaintance
with
chinese
characters
may
be
found
useful
by
the
student
of
japanese
it
is
no
more
indispensable
than
that
of
latin
is
to
a
person
who
wishes
to
acquire
italian
or
spanish
we
were
consequently
bundled
off
to
japan
with
the
least
possible
delay
of
the
eight
students
belonging
to
the
china
establishment
then
at
peking
three
only
are
still
in
the
service
allen
gardner
and
stronach
each
of
whom
attained
the
rank
of
consul
in
they
had
all
passed
the
examination
at
the
same
time
as
myself
the
man
who
came
out
second
was
allowed
to
resign
in
three
are
dead
and
one
the
best
man
of
the
whole
set
and
who
oddly
enough
was
last
or
last
but
one
in
the
examination
list
passed
in
into
the
chinese
customs
service
in
which
he
now
holds
one
of
the
highest
appointments
so
unequal
are
the
results
obtained
by
even
limited
competitive
examination
when
the
competition
was
afterwards
thrown
open
to
the
public
the
results
became
even
more
uncertain
as
later
experience
has
shown
at
least
in
japan
and
perhaps
elsewhere
the
great
fault
of
the
system
is
that
it
takes
no
account
of
moral
qualities
whether
a
candidate
has
the
manners
or
feelings
of
a
gentleman
can
not
be
ascertained
from
the
way
in
which
he
will
reproduce
a
proposition
of
euclid
or
translate
a
passage
from
a
greek
author
it
does
not
test
the
intellectual
powers
for
a
stupid
young
man
who
has
been
properly
coached
will
almost
always
beat
the
real
student
who
has
not
got
the
right
tips
nowadays
every
candidate
for
a
public
examination
goes
to
a
crammer
who
trains
him
in
a
few
months
for
the
contest
and
enables
him
to
bring
forth
forced
fruit
for
a
moment
show
me
a
successful
examinee
and
i
will
show
you
a
candidate
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
process
disgusts
the
man
who
has
undergone
it
and
takes
away
any
inclination
he
may
previously
have
had
for
study
and
without
serious
study
it
is
not
possible
to
acquire
such
languages
as
chinese
siamese
or
japanese
the
scheme
of
examination
is
no
test
of
the
linguistic
capabilities
of
the
men
and
sometimes
sends
into
the
service
those
who
can
no
more
learn
to
speak
a
foreign
language
than
they
can
fly
my
own
success
in
the
examination
was
due
to
my
having
left
school
more
recently
than
any
of
the
other
competitors
while
i
was
at
peking
the
whole
body
of
students
was
invited
to
dine
one
evening
with
the
bishop
of
victoria
who
was
stopping
at
the
legation
in
the
absence
of
bruce
the
minister
the
conversation
fell
upon
the
effects
of
chinese
studies
on
the
intellectual
powers
and
the
bishop
inquired
of
us
whether
we
did
not
find
that
the
mind
was
weakened
by
close
application
to
such
a
dry
unproductive
form
of
learning
at
least
his
own
experience
had
been
to
that
effect
this
was
a
curious
admission
to
make
but
the
matter
of
his
conversation
certainly
corroborated
it
i
do
not
think
any
of
us
was
candid
enough
to
confess
to
a
similar
result
in
his
own
case
i
should
like
to
dwell
longer
on
our
life
in
peking
the
rides
in
the
early
morning
over
the
plain
on
the
north
of
the
city
excursions
to
the
ruins
of
the
summer
palace
beautiful
still
in
its
desolation
the
monasteries
among
the
blue
mountains
west
of
the
city
the
magnificent
temples
inside
and
outside
the
walls
the
dirt
and
dust
of
the
streets
in
wet
or
fine
weather
the
pink
lotus
blossoms
on
the
lake
of
the
marble
bridge
the
beggars
with
their
cry
of
shang
the
bazaar
outside
the
men
gate
with
its
attractive
shops
the
temple
of
heaven
the
view
of
yellow
brown
and
roofs
embosomed
in
trees
as
one
saw
them
from
the
city
wall
the
carts
bumping
over
the
stone
pavements
worn
into
deep
ruts
the
strange
eastern
life
that
surrounded
a
band
of
boys
fresh
from
school
or
college
or
their
mothers
and
the
splendour
of
the
newly
restored
buildings
of
the
liang
kung
fu
occupied
by
the
british
legation
which
will
never
be
effaced
from
my
memory
but
there
is
no
time
mr
afterwards
sir
frederick
bruce
was
then
our
minister
there
a
tall
man
of
about
fifty
with
a
noble
forehead
and
brown
eyes
grey
beard
whiskers
and
moustache
altogether
a
beautiful
appearance
the
chinese
secretary
was
mr
afterwards
sir
thomas
wade
a
great
chinese
scholar
to
whom
we
looked
up
with
awe
and
who
was
said
to
be
of
an
irascible
temper
a
story
was
told
of
his
visiting
the
chinese
ministers
with
the
chief
and
waxing
very
warm
in
argument
the
president
of
the
remarked
but
wade
i
do
not
observe
that
bruce
is
so
angry
d
hear
that
bruce
they
say
you
not
angry
whereupon
bruce
with
a
benevolent
smile
and
with
the
most
expression
in
the
world
replied
oh
tell
them
i
in
a
deuce
of
a
rage
we
that
is
to
say
jamieson
robertson
and
myself
got
away
early
on
the
morning
of
august
arriving
that
evening
at
a
town
on
the
way
and
reached
tientsin
next
day
thence
we
took
boat
to
taku
where
we
passed
some
days
under
the
hospitable
roof
of
the
gibson
he
was
later
on
transferred
to
a
post
in
formosa
where
he
got
into
difficulties
with
the
chinese
officials
and
called
on
the
commander
of
a
gunboat
to
bombard
the
custom
house
for
which
he
was
smartly
reprimanded
by
the
foreign
office
shortly
afterwards
he
died
it
was
said
of
a
broken
heart
this
happened
in
the
days
when
the
policy
was
no
longer
in
favour
and
poor
gibson
fell
a
victim
to
his
excess
of
zeal
at
shanghai
jamieson
left
us
to
start
a
newspaper
on
terms
which
promised
him
a
better
future
than
the
consular
service
could
offer
robertson
and
i
embarked
in
the
steamer
and
started
for
japan
on
september
the
first
land
we
sighted
after
leaving
the
coast
of

on

found
ourselves
close
to

in
a
fog
luckily
it
lifted
for
a
moment
and
the
captain
who
was
new
to
the

ordered
the

to
be
put
about
and
we
ran
down
among

we
were
steaming
over

of

passed
the

on

and
the
tiny
inlet
of

to

and
stood
across
the
broad
bay
towards
yokohama
it
was
one
of
those
brilliant
days
that
are
so
characteristic
of
japan
and
as
we
made
our
way
up
the
bay
of
yedo
i
thought
no
scenery
in
the
world
could
surpass
it
hills
covered
with

lined
the
whole

rose
into

and
more
the
magnificent
cone
of

with
scarcely
a
patch
of
snow
visible
the
noble
ranges
of
oyama
and
others
bounded
the

on
its
western
side
while
by
way
of
contrast
a
sandy

trended
rapidly
away
on

sank
below

formed
of

crowded
the

then
we
passed
near
enough
to
note
the
sunburnt
skins
of
the

naked
with
the
exception
of
a
white
cloth
round
the

a

official
and
unofficial
three
years
had
now
elapsed
since
the
opening
of
the
country
to
foreign
trade
in
consequence
of
the
treaties
of
and
a
considerable
number
of
merchants
had
settled
at
the
ports
of
nagasaki
and
yokohama
hakodaté
however
offered
then
as
now
few
attractions
to
mercantile
enterprise
and
being
far
removed
from
the
political
centre
shared
very
slightly
in
the
uneasy
feeling
which
prevailed
elsewhere
at
nagasaki
most
of
the
territorial
nobles
of
western
japan
had
establishments
whither
they
sent
for
sale
the
rice
and
other
produce
received
in
payment
of
tribute
from
the
peasants
and
their
retainers
came
into
frequent
contact
with
foreigners
whose
houses
they
visited
for
the
purchase
of
arms
gunpowder
and
steamers
some
sort
of
friendly
feeling
thus
sprang
up
which
was
increased
by
the
american
missionaries
who
gave
instruction
in
english
to
younger
members
of
this
class
and
imparted
to
them
liberal
ideas
which
had
no
small
influence
on
the
subsequent
course
of
events
at
yokohama
however
the
foreign
merchants
had
chiefly
to
do
with
a
class
of
adventurers
destitute
of
capital
and
ignorant
of
commerce
broken
contracts
and
fraud
were
by
no
means
uncommon
foreigners
made
large
advances
to
men
of
straw
for
the
purchase
of
merchandise
which
was
never
delivered
or
ordered
manufactures
from
home
on
the
account
of
men
who
if
the
market
fell
refused
to
accept
the
goods
that
would
now
bring
them
in
only
a
loss
raw
silk
was
adulterated
with
sand
or
fastened
with
heavy
paper
ties
and
every
separate
skein
had
to
be
carefully
inspected
before
payment
while
the
tea
could
not
be
trusted
to
be
as
good
as
the
sample
now
and
then
a
japanese
dealer
would
get
paid
out
in
kind
but
the
balance
of
was
greatly
against
the
native
and
the
conviction
that
japanese
was
a
synonym
for
dishonest
trader
became
so
firmly
seated
in
the
minds
of
foreigners
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
friendly
feeling
to
exist
the
custom
house
officials
were
in
the
highest
degree
corrupt
and
demanded
bribes
from
the
foreigners
who
sought
to
elude
the
import
duties
one
of
the
worst
abuses
was
the
importation
of
large
quantities
of
wines
beer
spirits
and
stores
for
which
exemption
from
the
payment
of
duty
was
claimed
as
goods
intended
for
personal
use
the
local
administration
was
carried
on
by
a
large
staff
of
officials
established
at
the
custom
house
there
were
two
bugiô
or
governors
two
or
two
metsuké
whose
function
was
that
of
keeping
an
eye
on
the
doings
of
the
others
a
number
of
or
directors
and
or
chief
clerks
besides
a
host
of

tidewaiters
and
policemen

or
green
robes
dutch
was
the
common
medium
of
communication
both
orally
and
in
writing
for
english
was
as
yet
scarcely
studied
by
the
natives
and
the
foreigners
who
could
speak
japanese
might
be
counted
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
yet
all
knew
a
little
a
sort
of
bastard
language
had
been
invented
for
the
uses
of
trade
in
which
the
malay
words
and
played
a
great
part
and
with
the
addition
of
and
every
one
fancied
himself
competent
to
settle
the
terms
of
a
complicated
transaction
in
this
new
tongue
all
the
rich
variety
of
japanese
speech
by
which
the
relative
social
position
of
the
speakers
is
indicated
and
the
intricate
inflexion
of
the
verbs
were
conspicuous
by
their
absence
outside
the
settlements
it
was
of
course
not
understood
and
its
use
by
europeans
must
have
contributed
not
a
little
to
the
contempt
for
the
barbarian
which
was
characteristic
of
the
native
attitude
towards
foreigners
by
virtue
of
the
treaties
kanagawa
had
been
at
first
fixed
upon
for
the
residence
of
europeans
but
lying
on
the
tôkaidô
or
principal
highway
between
yedo
and
kiôto
it
was
only
too
well
calculated
to
afford
occasion
for
collision
between
the
armed
followers
of
the
japanese
nobles
and
the
foreign
settlers
early
in
the
day
the
government
sought
to
avoid
this
difficulty
by
erecting
a
custom
house
and
rows
of
wooden
bungalows
at
the
fishing
village
of
yokohama
across
the
shallow
bay
to
the
south
some
of
the
foreign
representatives
more
intent
upon
enforcing
treaty
provisions
than
desirous
of
meeting
the
convenience
of
the
native
officials
and
the
european
merchants
strongly
opposed
this
arrangement
but
the
practical
advantages
of
proximity
to
the
anchorage
and
personal
security
won
the
favour
of
the
merchants
and
yokohama
became
recognised
as
the
port
long
after
and
perhaps
to
this
day
the
foreign
consuls
continued
to
date
their
official
reports
from
kanagawa
though
they
were
safely
ensconced
at
the
rival
site
where
a
town
of
inhabitants
now
exists
and
curious
stories
are
told
of
the
difference
in
freight
that
used
to
be
earned
on
goods
shipped
from
europe
to
yokohama
or
kanagawa
as
the
case
might
be
the
foreign
settlement
for
greater
security
was
surrounded
on
the
land
side
by
wide
canals
across
which
bridges
were
thrown
while
ingress
and
egress
were
controlled
by
strong
guards
of
soldiers
placed
there
with
the
double
object
of
excluding
dangerous
characters
and
levying
a
tax
on
the
supplies
introduced
from
the
surrounding
country
at
first
land
was
given
away
freely
to
all
applicants
some
of
whom
were
employés
of
the
different
consulates
these
latter
afterwards
sold
their
lots
to
new
arrivals
bent
upon
commercial
pursuits
and
thus
pocketed
gains
to
which
they
had
no
shadow
of
a
right
when
further
additions
were
afterwards
made
to
the
settlement
precautions
were
taken
which
effectually
prevented
any
one
whether
merchant
or
official
from
obtaining
land
without
paying
an
adequate
price
later
on
were
made
out
by
which
the
ground
was
conveyed
to
the
holders
their
heirs
administrators
executors
and
assigns
thus
creating
a
form
of
property
new
to
english
experience
which
purported
to
be
at
once
real
and
personal
streets
were
laid
out
with
but
little
thought
of
the
general
convenience
and
slight
provision
for
the
future
the
day
of
wheeled
carriages
had
not
dawned
upon
japan
it
was
sufficient
if
space
were
left
for
handcarts
and
the
most
important
japanese
commercial
town
of
the
future
was
thus
condemned
in
perpetuity
to
inconveniences
of
traffic
the
like
of
which
can
be
best
appreciated
by
those
who
knew
the
central
parts
of
business
london
fifty
years
ago
or
the
successive
capitals
of
the
italian
kingdom
when
they
were
raised
to
that
rank
architectural
ambition
at
first
was
contented
with
simple
wooden
bungalows
and
in
the
latter
part
of
there
were
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
buildings
in
the
foreign
portion
of
the
town
behind
the
settlement
lay
a
newly
tract
of
ground
known
as
the
swamp
still
unoccupied
except
by
a
racecourse
track
and
in
the
rear
of
this
again
across
a
foul
marsh
were
conspicuous
the
flimsy
buildings
of
the
yoshiwara
euphemistically
described
by
a
noble
duke
from
his
place
in
parliament
as
an
establishment
for
the
education
of
young
ladies
and
where
a
colonial
bishop
to
the
intense
amusement
of
the
younger
and
more
irreverent
of
the
foreign
community
had
innocently
left
his
upon
the
elderly
female
who
presided
over
the
pleasures
of
the
place
but
in
those
days
all
the
residents
were
young
two
churches
however
had
already
been
erected
by
catholics
and
protestants
respectively
and
a
foreign
cemetery
had
been
set
apart
on
the
outside
of
the
settlement
the
health
enjoyed
by
the
european
and
american
inhabitants
was
such
that
the
only
occupants
of
the
were
some
russian
officers
and
two
dutch
merchant
captains
who
had
fallen
victims
to
the
deadly
and
mistaken
patriotism
of
japanese
men
no
one
had
yet
succumbed
to
disease
in
that
beautiful
sunny
climate
the
foreign
community
of
yokohama
of
that
day
was
somewhat
extravagantly
described
by
an
english
diplomat
as
the
scum
of
europe
no
doubt
there
was
a
fair
sprinkling
of
men
who
suddenly
relieved
from
the
restraints
which
social
opinion
places
upon
their
class
at
home
and
exposed
to
the
temptations
of
eastern
life
did
not
conduct
themselves
with
the
strict
propriety
of
students
at
a
theological
college
that
they
were
really
worse
than
their
elsewhere
is
unlikely
but
in
a
small
community
where
the
actions
of
everyone
are
and
concealment
is
not
regarded
as
an
object
of
importance
the
vices
that
elsewhere
pass
unnoticed
become
prominent
to
the
eyes
of
those
who
are
not
exposed
to
the
same
temptations
there
were
also
not
a
few
who
came
there
without
much
capital
to
make
a
livelihood
or
if
possible
something
more
and
hastened
to
the
attainment
of
their
object
without
being
troubled
with
much
scruple
and
the
difficulty
which
soon
presented
itself
of
obtaining
a
sufficiency
of
native
coin
in
exchange
for
the
silver
dollar
of
eastern
commerce
was
the
cause
of
extravagant
demands
being
presented
to
the
japanese
treasury
but
the
compromise
eventually
arrived
at
by
which
the
merchant
had
to
buy
his
in
the
open
market
while
the
official
obtained
the
equivalent
of
his
salary
and
often
much
more
in
native
coin
nearly
weight
for
weight
of
his
mexicans
was
to
the
minds
of
all
unprejudiced
persons
a
far
greater
scandal
detractors
said
that
the
advantages
thus
given
to
ministers
consuls
sailors
and
soldiers
was
a
bribe
to
induce
their
compliance
with
violation
of
treaty
stipulations
to
the
prejudice
of
their
countrymen
but
this
is
unfair
it
was
the
result
of
false
theories
as
to
the
nature
and
function
of
money
and
personal
interest
worked
against
a
conversion
to
views
more
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
political
economy
the
fact
however
remains
that
in
september
the
current
rate
of
exchange
was
for
dollars
though
the
latter
were
really
exchangeable
for
according
to
the
treaty
each
diplomatic
or
consular
establishment
was
allowed
to
exchange
monthly
a
certain
number
of
dollars
supposed
to
represent
the
total
salaries
of
the
staff
and
other
government
charges
thirteen
per
being
deducted
for
coinage
an
official
whose
salary
was
received
the
surplus
of
which
over
his
bazaar
expenses
he
proceeded
to
change
back
into
dollars
but
practically
he
received
or
a
profit
of
nearly
per
cent
the
gains
of
a
minister
whose
salary
was
a
year
it
may
easily
be
seen
were
very
large
this
was
not
all
the
balance
of
the
monthly
quota
of
was
then
reconverted
into
dollars
the
amount
due
to
the
official
chest
was
deducted
and
the
profit
then
divided
among
the
staff
in
proportion
to
their
salaries
on
a
nominally
small
income
it
was
consequently
possible
to
live
well
keep
a
pony
and
drink
champagne
as
time
went
on
the
number
of
thus
put
into
circulation
increased
and
the
rate
of
exchange
eventually
declined
to
par
then
and
only
then
the
system
was
abandoned
where
the
money
came
from
that
was
thus
transferred
to
the
pockets
of
officials
can
be
best
explained
by
those
who
are
versed
in
economical
questions
for
my
own
part
i
can
not
look
back
on
that
period
without
shame
and
my
only
excuse
which
is
perhaps
of
little
worth
in
the
court
of
history
is
that
i
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
and
received
the
proportion
paid
to
me
by
those
who
were
in
charge
of
the
business
a
few
words
may
be
devoted
to
describing
the
yokohama
society
of
those
days
there
were
few
ladies
in
the
settlement
japan
was
a
long
way
from
europe
with
no
regular
steam
communication
and
the
lives
of
foreigners
were
supposed
to
be
not
very
safe
at
the
hands
of
the
classes
the
two
great
china
firms
of
jardine
matheson
and
dent
were
of
course
represented
the
latter
came
down
with
a
crash
a
year
or
two
after
my
arrival
fletcher
another
important
shanghai
firm
had
a
branch
and
so
had
barnet
both
now
long
forgotten
most
of
the
remainder
were
japan
firms
amongst
whom
aspinall
cornes
macpherson
marshall
were
the
foremost
english
and
walsh
hall
the
leading
american
firms
germans
french
and
dutch
were
considered
of
no
account
money
was
abundant
or
seemed
to
be
every
one
kept
a
pony
or
two
and
champagne
flowed
freely
at
frequent
convivial
entertainments
races
were
held
in
the
spring
and
autumn
and
real
horses
competed
in
some
of
the
events
a
favourite
excursion
was
the
ride
along
the
tôkaidô
to
kawasaki
for
tiffin
and
back
again
toward
evening
longer
outings
were
to
kanazawa
kamakura
and
enoshima
but
anyone
who
had
ventured
as
far
as
hachiôji
or
hakoné
which
were
beyond
the
treaty
limits
was
regarded
as
a
bold
adventurous
spirit
the
privilege
of
travelling
beyond
a
distance
of
miles
from
yokohama
was
reserved
to
the
diplomatic
representatives
of
foreign
powers
and
yedo
could
be
visited
only
in
the
disguise
of
a
member
of
one
of
the
legations
with
the
permission
of
its
head
such
favours
were
regarded
with
extreme
jealousy
by
those
who
were
debarred
by
circumstances
from
obtaining
them
and
loud
murmurs
were
heard
that
it
was
the
minister
duty
to
invite
his
countrymen
to
the
capital
and
give
them
board
and
lodging
irrespective
of
the
shape
which
their
private
relations
with
him
might
have
assumed
then
and
perhaps
even
yet
there
existed
a
theory
that
public
servants
were
practically
the
servants
of
the
extremely
small
section
of
the
public
that
inhabited
yokohama
and
when
the
servants
failed
to
comply
with
the
wishes
of
their
employers
they
were
naturally
and
rightly
abused
behind
their
backs
so
strong
was
the
hostility
excited
in
the
breasts
of
the
portion
of
the
community
by
the
unlucky
phrase
scum
of
europe
that
no
member
of
either
legation
or
consulate
of
their
country
was
allowed
admittance
into
the
yokohama
club
composed
chiefly
of
british
merchants
and
this
feeling
lasted
until
the
year
brought
about
a
permanent
change
in
the
representation
of
great
britain
the
excuse
for
such
relations
between
the
british
residents
and
one
who
ought
to
have
been
the
leader
of
the
small
society
is
to
be
found
in
the
comparative
youthfulness
and
ignorance
of
the
world
which
characterised
the
former
the
experience
of
men
and
manners
which
saves
the
dwellers
in
little
peddlington
from
believing
that
others
are
deliberately
plotting
to
inflict
insults
on
them
is
seldom
attained
before
middle
life
especially
when
little
peddlington
happens
to
be
located
in
an
eastern
land
where
the
mind
growth
comes
to
a
standstill
and
a
man
age
is
virtually
to
be
reckoned
by
the
years
actually
spent
in
the
mother
country
for
all
purposes
of
mental
and
moral
development
the
time
passed
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
world
must
be
left
out
of
the
calculation
it
was
agreed
in
the
treaties
that
yedo
should
be
the
residence
of
the
foreign
diplomatic
representatives
and
four
buddhist
monasteries
had
in
accordance
with
japanese
custom
been
assigned
to
the
representatives
of
the
four
chief
powers
great
britain
france
holland
and
the
united
states
sir
alcock
occupied
in
the
suburb
of
takanawa
de
graef
van
polsbrock
lived
in
a
little
nearer
the
city
then
came
the
residence
of
duchesne
de
bellecourt
and
harris
had
settled
down
at
in
azabu
but
a
series
of
alarming
occurrences
had
caused
the
european
portion
of
the
diplomatic
body
to
transfer
their
quarters
to
yokohama
and
the
american
minister
alone
held
out
declaring
his
confidence
in
the
good
faith
of
the
japanese
government
and
their
ability
to
protect
him
in
september
of
he
had
already
been
replaced
by
general
pruyn
who
followed
the
example
of
his
predecessor
until
eventually
driven
out
of
the
capital
by
a
fire
which
destroyed
his
house
whether
purely
accidental
or
maliciously
contrived
the
english
legation
in
had
been
the
object
of
a
murderous
attack
in
which
the
secretary
laurence
oliphant
and
morrison
were
wounded
the
assailants
were
principally
retainers
of
the
daimiô
of
mito
but
others
belonging
to
various
clans
were
concerned
in
the
affair
and
some
of
these
are
still
living
sir
alcock
had
consequently
removed
to
yokohama
where
the
strong
guard
placed
by
the
japanese
government
at
the
entrances
to
the
town
and
the
foreign
in
the
harbour
offered
sufficient
guarantees
for
safety
on
his
quitting
japan
for
a
term
of
leave
early
in
his
colonel
neale
not
believing
in
a
danger
of
which
he
had
no
experience
brought
the
legation
back
to
but
he
had
no
sooner
installed
himself
there
than
an
event
occurred
which
led
him
to
change
his
opinion
this
was
nothing
less
than
the
murder
of
the
sentry
who
stood
at
his
bedroom
door
and
of
a
corporal
on
his
rounds
at
the
hands
of
one
of
the
japanese
guard
in
revenge
for
an
insult
offered
to
him
it
is
said
by
the
youngest
member
of
the
staff
a
heedless
boy
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
so
the
british
legation
packed
up
their
archives
and
hastened
back
to
yokohama
where
they
installed
themselves
in
a
house
that
stood
on
the
site
of
the
present
grand
hotel
this
building
belonged
to
an
englishman
named
hoey
who
was
murdered
in
his
bed
in
apparently
from
motives
of
private
revenge
the
foreign
consuls
were
all
stationed
at
yokohama
with
the
exception
of
the
american
consul
colonel
fisher
who
remained
at
kanagawa
harris
it
is
said
would
never
admit
that
yokohama
could
be
rightfully
substituted
for
kanagawa
the
town
mentioned
in
the
treaty
and
would
not
permit
his
consul
to
reside
there
he
even
carried
his
opposition
so
far
as
to
declare
that
he
never
would
countenance
the
change
of
settlement
and
carried
out
his
vow
by
leaving
japan
without
having
set
foot
in
yokohama
it
would
be
inconvenient
to
observe
chronological
exactness
in
matters
of
official
rank
or
title
which
in
the
case
of
most
individuals
are
subject
to
progression
i
shall
speak
therefore
of
persons
by
the
titles
they
bore
at
the
latest
portion
of
the
period
covered
by
these
reminiscences
at
the
time
of
my
arrival
there
colonel
neale
an
old
warrior
who
had
seen
service
with
the
spanish
legion
commanded
by
sir
de
lacy
evans
and
who
gossip
said
regarded
sir
alcock
formerly
attached
to
the
marine
brigade
of
portugal
in
the
quality
of
surgeon
with
no
friendly
feelings
was
secretary
of
legation
and
consequently
chargé
in
the
absence
of
his
chief
he
had
great
command
of
his
pen
and
composed
most
drastic
notes
to
the
japanese
government
some
of
which
have
been
printed
by
my
friend
adams
in
his
of
he
had
previously
been
consul
at
varna
and
belgrade
and
consequently
had
a
sufficient
experience
of
the
system
known
as
which
in
most
countries
of
the
east
exempts
europeans
from
the
operations
of
the
local
law
in
stature
considerably
less
than
the
average
englishman
he
wore
a
heavy
grey
moustache
and
thin
wisps
of
grizzled
hair
wandered
about
his
forehead
his
temper
was
sour
and
suspicious
of
his
political
capacity
there
is
not
much
to
be
said
except
that
he
did
not
understand
the
circumstances
amongst
which
he
was
thrown
as
his
despatches
sufficiently
indicate
and
incisive
as
they
are
but
this
is
only
an
example
of
the
fact
that
power
of
speech
with
tongue
or
pen
is
not
a
measure
of
a
man
fitness
for
the
conduct
of
affairs
in
his
jovial
moments
he
easily
unbent
and
would
entertain
his
companions
with
snatches
of
operas
of
which
he
carried
a
large
assortment
in
his
memory
at
this
period
he
was
about
and
probably
already
affected
with
the
beginnings
of
the
disease
which
carried
him
off
a
few
years
later
at
quito
the
second
in
rank
was
the
japanese
secretary
he
was
neither
a
native
of
japan
nor
had
he
any
knowledge
of
the
language
so
that
the
title
must
be
understood
as
signifying
secretary
in
charge
of
correspondence
with
the
japanese
government
at
our
mission
in
china
there
is
always
an
official
who
bears
the
corresponding
title
of
chinese
secretary
but
there
the
post
has
always
been
held
by
a
scholar
dutch
was
the
only
european
language
of
which
the
japanese
knew
anything
and
therefore
when
the
foreign
office
came
to
provide
a
staff
of
officials
for
the
consular
establishment
they
sought
high
and
low
for
englishmen
acquainted
with
that
recondite
tongue
four
were
at
last
discovered
one
of
whom
was
first
appointed
interpreter
to
the
legation
and
afterwards
accorded
the
higher
title
part
of
his
salary
was
expressly
granted
by
way
of
remuneration
for
instructing
the
in
the
language
of
the
country
and
consequently
could
not
be
said
to
be
earned
he
retained
his
office
for
eight
years
when
a
consulate
became
vacant
and
the
opportunity
was
at
once
seized
of
kicking
him
up
the
ladder
all
the
domestic
virtues
were
his
and
of
actively
bad
qualities
he
showed
no
trace
next
to
this
gentleman
came
a
first
assistant
sociable
and
accomplished
musical
artistic
and
speaking
many
languages
beside
his
own
but
no
lover
of
hard
work
in
his
hands
the
accounts
fell
eighteen
months
in
arrear
and
the
registers
of
correspondence
were
a
couple
of
years
behind
hand
it
was
his
function
to
preside
over
the
chancery
and
he
left
it
to
his
successor
in
a
condition
which
the
latter
aptly
compared
to
that
of
an
aegean
stable
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
is
always
known
among
his
friends
by
his
christian
name
and
no
higher
tribute
to
personal
qualities
is
possible
in
the
course
of
time
he
became
a
consul
and
retired
from
the
service
at
an
early
age
carrying
with
him
the
regrets
and
good
wishes
of
everybody
who
knew
him
in
the
legation
staff
there
were
also
included
two
doctors
who
at
the
same
time
discharged
the
functions
of
assistants
in
the
chancery
one
of
them
shortly
quitted
the
service
and
set
up
in
yokohama
as
a
general
practitioner
to
retire
with
a
competent
fortune
after
but
a
few
years
the
other
merits
more
extended
notice
on
account
both
of
his
character
and
public
services
of
every
kind
i
mean
my
friend
william
willis
perhaps
no
other
man
ever
exhibited
in
a
greater
measure
the
quality
which
we
are
wont
to
call
conscientiousness
whether
in
his
private
relations
or
in
the
discharge
of
his
duties
those
who
have
had
the
fortune
to
profit
by
his
medical
or
surgical
aid
feel
that
no
man
could
be
more
tender
or
sympathetic
towards
a
patient
he
was
devoted
to
his
profession
and
lost
no
opportunity
of
extending
his
experience
in
those
days
a
doctor
had
frequently
to
encounter
personal
risks
such
as
fall
to
the
lot
of
few
civilians
he
exposed
himself
freely
in
order
to
succour
the
wounded
in
the
chancery
his
services
were
indispensable
he
it
was
who
swept
the
stable
arranged
the
archives
in
order
and
brought
the
register
up
to
date
always
on
the
spot
when
he
was
wanted
an
indefatigable
worker
and
unswervingly
loyal
to
his
chief
after
nine
years
service
he
was
promoted
to
be
a
but
by
this
time
the
japanese
had
become
so
impressed
with
his
value
as
a
surgeon
and
physician
that
they
begged
him
to
accept
a
salary
more
than
four
times
what
he
received
from
the
foreign
office
and
he
went
where
his
great
qualities
were
likely
to
be
of
more
use
than
in
trying
petty
police
cases
and
drawing
up
trade
reports
of
a
city
which
never
had
any
foreign
commerce
his
gigantic
stature
made
him
conspicuous
among
all
the
europeans
who
have
resided
in
japan
since
the
ports
were
opened
and
when
i
first
knew
him
he
was
hardly
five
and
twenty
years
of
age
a
man
endowed
with
an
untiring
power
of
application
accurate
memory
for
words
and
things
and
brimful
of
good
stories
from
the
three
kingdoms
big
men
are
and
he
was
no
exception
we
shall
come
across
him
again
repeatedly
in
the
course
of
these
reminiscences
and
for
the
present
these
few
words
must
suffice
besides
these
the
legation
staff
included
russell
brooke
robertson
and
myself
as
last
but
not
least
were
the
officers
of
the
mounted
escort
and
infantry
guard
the
latter
was
commanded
by
lieut
price
of
the
regiment
and
was
soon
replaced
by
fifty
marines
under
the
command
of
a
man
widely
known
in
the
service
to
which
he
belonged
as
smith
i
shall
say
more
of
him
later
on
the
cavalry
escort
consisted
of
a
dozen
men
from
the
military
train
a
corps
which
went
by
the
honorary
title
of
and
at
their
head
was
a
lieutenant
a
good
harmless
sort
of
fellow
whose
only
weakness
was
for
fine
uniforms
and
showy
horses
not
being
learned
in
the
extremely
complicated
subject
of
military
costume
full
dress
half
dress
and
undress
i
can
not
say
what
it
was
that
he
had
adopted
for
himself
but
it
was
whispered
about
that
he
had
been
audacious
enough
to
assume
the
insignia
of
a
which
is
undoubtedly
a
serious
offence
against
discipline
however
that
may
be
the
blaze
of
gold
which
decorated
his
person
was
wonderful
to
behold
and
on
at
least
one
occasion
when
we
were
going
in
solemn
procession
to
an
audience
of
the
tycoon
caused
him
to
be
mistaken
for
the
envoy
by
the
japanese
officials
who
gave
him
the
salutes
that
rightfully
belonged
to
his
less
conspicuously
adorned
diplomatic
chief
to
determine
whether
the
pleasure
derived
from
this
confusion
of
persons
by
the
one
outweighed
the
mortification
which
might
not
unnaturally
have
been
felt
by
the
other
would
have
required
a
delicate
moral
balance
which
was
not
available
at
the
moment
but
judging
from
the
relative
scale
of
the
two
men
in
other
points
of
character
i
am
inclined
to
infer
that
the
good
preponderated
largely
over
the
evil
and
that
applying
consequently
the
criterion
so
unfairly
attributed
to
the
utilitarians
by
their
opponents
we
must
arrive
at
the
provisional
conclusion
that
the
uniform
was
highly
virtuous
and
worthy
of
the
applause
of
mankind
but
it
is
time
to
quit
this
gossiping
tone
and
speak
of
more
serious
matters
chapter
iii
political
conditions
in
japan
at
this
period
the
movement
had
already
commenced
that
finally
culminated
in
what
may
fitly
be
called
the
revolution
of
by
which
the
feudal
system
was
destroyed
and
the
old
monarchical
government
revived
the
tendency
of
the
times
was
as
yet
scarcely
perceived
by
foreigners
with
but
one
or
two
exceptions
they
generally
supposed
that
political
strife
had
broken
out
between
the
sovereign
and
a
few
unruly
vassals
dissatisfied
with
the
treaties
that
permitted
the
sacred
soil
of
japan
to
be
defiled
by
the
footsteps
of
barbarians
and
secured
all
the
profits
of
trade
to
the
head
of
the
state
the
vassals
being
enabled
to
defy
their
suzerain
owing
to
his
own
feebleness
and
the
incapacity
of
his
ministers
it
was
still
believed
that
the
potentate
in
whose
name
the
treaties
had
been
concluded
was
the
temporal
sovereign
and
that
the
mikado
was
little
more
than
the
head
of
the
priesthood
or
spiritual
emperor
this
theory
of
the
japanese
constitution
was
almost
as
old
as
the
earliest
knowledge
of
the
country
possessed
by
europeans
marco
polo
indeed
says
nothing
of
its
system
of
government
in
the
two
short
chapters
which
he
devotes
to
zipangu
but
the
jesuit
missionaries
who
laboured
in
japan
during
the
and
centuries
uniformly
held
the
mikado
to
be
a
spiritual
dignitary
and
spoke
of
the
shôgun
as
the
real
ruler
of
the
country
the
temporal
king
and
even
emperor
kaempfer
the
best
known
and
most
often
quoted
of
the
authorities
on
japan
writing
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
calls
the
two
potentates
ecclesiastical
and
secular
emperors
and
his
example
had
up
to
the
time
i
am
writing
of
been
followed
by
all
his
successors
without
exception
the
truth
is
that
the
polity
of
the
japanese
state
had
assumed
already
in
the
century
the
form
which
it
was
still
displaying
at
the
beginning
of
the
latter
half
of
the
and
institutions
which
could
boast
of
such
a
highly
respectable
antiquity
might
well
be
supposed
to
have
taken
a
deep
enough
hold
to
be
part
and
parcel
of
the
national
life
the
history
of
japan
has
still
to
be
written
native
chronicles
of
the
mikados
and
annals
of
leading
families
exist
in
abundance
but
the
japanese
mind
is
only
just
now
beginning
to
emancipate
itself
from
the
thraldom
of
chinese
literary
forms
while
no
european
has
yet
attempted
a
task
which
requires
a
training
different
from
that
of
most
men
who
pursue
an
eastern
career
until
within
the
last
two
decades
the
literature
of
japan
was
almost
entirely
unknown
to
europeans
and
the
existing
keys
to
the
language
were
ridiculously
inadequate
the
only
historical
works
accessible
to
foreigners
were
the
scanty
des
translated
by
titsingh
with
the
aid
of
native
dutch
interpreters
and
edited
by
klaproth
with
a
degree
of
bold
confidence
that
nothing
but
the
position
of
a
man
amongst
the
blind
can
give
and
a
set
of
chronological
tables
translated
by
hoffman
for
siebold
it
is
no
wonder
therefore
if
at
the
outset
of
treaty
relations
the
foreign
representatives
were
at
a
loss
to
appreciate
the
exact
nature
of
the
political
questions
that
confronted
them
and
were
unable
to
diagnose
the
condition
of
the
patient
whose
previous
history
was
unknown
to
them
to
trace
in
detail
the
development
of
the
japanese
monarchy
from
its
beginnings
as
a
pure
theocracy
of
foreign
invaders
attracting
to
itself
the
allegiance
of
a
number
of
small
tribal
chieftains
the
fusion
of
these
tribes
with
their
conquerors
into
one
seemingly
homogeneous
race
the
remodelling
of
the
administration
which
followed
upon
the
introduction
of
chinese
laws
and
philosophy
the
supplanting
of
the
native
hero
and
native
worship
by
the
creed
of
gautama
the
rise
of
a
military
caste
brought
about
by
the
constant
warfare
with
the
barbarous
tribes
in
the
east
and
north
of
the
country
the
rivalry
of
the
taira
and
minamoto
clans
both
sprung
from
younger
sons
of
the
mikados
and
the
final
suppression
of
the
civil
administration
in
the
provinces
by
the
distribution
of
the
country
amongst
the
followers
of
the
minamoto
and
their
allies
would
require
a
profound
study
of
documents
which
no
one
has
yet
undertaken
with
the
appointment
of
yoritomo
to
be
the
feudal
system
was
fully
established
the
ancient
official
hierarchy
still
existed
at
kiôto
but
in
name
only
exercising
no
influence
whatever
over
the
conduct
of
affairs
and
in
the
century
its
functions
were
already
so
far
forgotten
as
to
become
the
subject
of
antiquarian
research
the
civil
and
penal
codes
borrowed
from
the
great
empire
of
eastern
asia
fell
into
disuse
and
in
part
even
the
very
traces
of
them
perished
martial
law
reigned
throughout
the
land
half
the
people
were
converted
into
a
huge
garrison
which
the
other
half
toiled
to
feed
and
clothe
reading
and
writing
were
the
exclusive
accomplishments
of
the
buddhist
priesthood
and
of
the
impoverished
nobles
who
formed
the
court
of
a
mikado
shorn
of
all
the
usual
attributes
of
a
sovereign
and
a
deep
sleep
fell
upon
the
literary
genius
of
the
nation
the
absence
of
danger
from
foreign
invasion
rendered
the
necessity
of
a
strong
central
administration
unfelt
and
japan
under
the
shôguns
assumed
the
aspect
of
germany
in
the
middle
ages
the
soil
being
divided
between
a
multitude
of
petty
potentates
independent
in
all
but
name
while
their
nominal
head
was
little
better
than
a
puppet
this
state
of
things
lasted
till
the
second
quarter
of
the
century
when
an
attempt
was
made
under
the
mikado
to
the
pristine
rule
of
the
legitimate
sovereigns
a
civil
war
ensued
that
lasted
for
over
fifty
years
until
the
ashikaga
family
finally
established
themselves
in
the
office
of
hereditary
shôguns
before
long
they
split
up
into
two
branches
which
quarrelled
among
themselves
and
gave
opportunity
for
local
chiefs
to
their
independence
in
the
middle
of
the
century
a
soldier
of
fortune
ota
nobunaga
by
name
profited
by
the
central
position
of
the
provinces
he
had
acquired
with
his
sword
to
arrogate
to
himself
the
right
of
arbitrating
between
the
warlike
leaders
who
had
risen
in
every
direction
after
his
assassination
a
still
greater
warrior
known
most
commonly
by
the
title
of
taicosama
carried
on
the
work
of
pacification
every
princelet
who
opposed
his
authority
was
in
turn
subdued
and
he
might
have
become
the
founder
of
a
new
line
of
du
he
died
however
before
time
had
sufficiently
consolidated
his
position
leaving
an
inexperienced
youth
heir
to
his
power
under
the
tutelage
of
guardians
who
speedily
quarrelled
the
most
distinguished
of
these
was
iyéyasu
who
besides
the
vast
domains
which
he
had
acquired
in
the
neighbourhood
of
yedo
the
modern
tôkiô
possessed
all
the
qualities
which
fit
a
man
to
lead
armies
and
rule
kingdoms
he
had
been
taicosama
sole
remaining
competitor
for
power
and
at
the
death
of
the
latter
naturally
assumed
the
most
prominent
position
in
the
country
a
couple
of
years
sufficed
for
the
transference
to
him
of
all
and
more
than
all
the
authority
wielded
by
his
two
predecessors
no
combination
against
him
had
any
chance
of
success
the
decisive
battle
of
sekigahara
in
brought
the
whole
nation
to
his
feet
and
he
made
full
use
of
this
opportunity
to
create
checks
upon
the
of
whose
fidelity
he
was
not
sufficiently
assured
by
grants
of
territories
to
his
own
friends
and
followers
a
few
of
the
older
families
alone
being
allowed
to
retain
their
ancient
fiefs
among
these
were
shimadzu
in
the
south
of
môri
in
the
extreme
west
and
daté
nambu
and
tsugaru
in
the
northern
provinces
of
the
main
island
his
own
sons
received
portions
in
owari
mito
and
elsewhere
in
at
iyéyasu
death
of
the
whole
country
was
held
by
his
adherents
thus
there
arose
five
or
six
classes
of
barons
as
they
may
best
be
called
to
render
their
position
intelligible
to
the
english
reader
firstly
there
were
the
three
families
descended
from
his
most
favoured
sons
from
whom
according
to
the
constitution
established
by
him
in
case
of
a
default
of
direct
heirs
the
successor
to
the
shôgunate
was
to
be
chosen
as
a
matter
of
fact
resort
was
had
only
to
when
a
break
in
the
line
occurred
next
came
the
related
families
sprung
from
his
younger
sons
and
in
the
third
place
were
ranked
the
lords
of
provinces
the
members
of
these
three
classes
enjoyed
the
revenue
of
fiefs
comprising
one
or
more
provinces
or
lands
of
equivalent
extent
below
them
in
importance
were
the
hereditary
servants
and
composed
as
has
been
said
before
of
the
immediate
retainers
of
the
tokugawa
family
and
the
stranger
lords
relics
of
the
former
barons
who
had
submitted
to
his
supremacy
and
followed
his
banner
in
his
last
wars
the
qualification
of
a
was
the
possession
of
lands
assessed
at
a
production
of
bushels
of
rice
and
upwards
the
were
retainers
of
the
tokugawa
family
whose
assessment
was
below
and
above
below
them
came
the
ordinary
vassals
the
fiefs
of
all
classes
of
the
were
in
their
turn
at
first
partitioned
out
among
their
retainers
and
called
in
their
relation
to
their
immediate
lords
and
arrière
vassals
as
being
vassals
of
those
who
acknowledged
the
suzerainty
of
the
shôgun
and
denoted
the
two
ranks
of
gentlemen
and
common
soldiers
among
the
retainers
of
the
in
the
end
every
retainer
except
the
of
satsuma
received
an
annual
allowance
of
so
much
rice
in
return
for
which
he
was
bound
to
perform
military
service
and
appear
in
the
field
or
discharge
the
ordinary
military
duties
required
in
time
of
peace
accompanied
by
followers
proportioned
in
number
to
his
income
in
satsuma
the
feudal
of
the
land
was
carried
out
to
the
fullest
extent
so
that
the
vassal
of
lowest
rank
held
the
sword
in
one
hand
and
the
hoe
in
the
other
no
taxes
were
paid
by
any
feudal
proprietor
the
and
other
barons
of
equal
rank
ruled
their
provinces
absolutely
levying
on
the
farmers
and
imposts
on
internal
trade
as
they
chose
they
had
further
the
power
of
life
and
death
subject
only
to
the
nominal
condition
of
reporting
once
a
year
the
capital
sentences
inflicted
by
their
officers
the
other
nobles
were
less
independent
every
had
to
maintain
an
establishment
at
the
capital
where
his
wife
and
children
resided
permanently
while
the
lord
passed
alternate
years
in
yedo
and
in
his
territories
on
his
journeys
to
and
fro
he
was
accompanied
by
a
little
army
of
retainers
for
whose
accommodation
inns
were
built
at
every
town
on
the
main
roads
throughout
the
country
and
the
expense
involved
was
a
heavy
tax
on
his
resources
a
strict
system
of
etiquette
regulated
the
audiences
with
which
the
were
favoured
on
their
arrival
and
departure
and
prescribed
the
presents
they
were
to
offer
as
a
symbol
of
their
inferiority
there
was
little
social
intercourse
among
them
and
they
lived
for
the
most
part
a
life
of
extreme
seclusion
surrounded
by
vast
numbers
of
women
and
servants
a
fixed
number
of
hereditary
councillors
and
checked
all
initiative
in
the
administration
of
their
fiefs
they
were
brought
up
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
outer
world
and
the
strings
of
government
were
pulled
by
the
unseen
hands
of
obscure
functionaries
who
obtained
their
appointments
by
force
of
their
personal
qualities
after
a
few
generations
had
passed
the
descendants
of
the
active
warriors
and
statesmen
of
iyéyasu
time
were
reduced
to
the
state
of
imbecile
puppets
while
the
hereditary
principle
produced
a
similar
effect
on
their
councillors
thus
arose
in
each
daimiate
a
condition
of
things
which
may
be
compared
to
that
of
a
highland
clan
where
the
ultimate
power
was
based
upon
the
feelings
and
opinions
of
a
poor
but
aristocratic
oligarchy
this
led
to
the
surprising
results
of
the
revolution
of
when
the
power
nominally
exercised
by
the
chief
came
to
be
wielded
by
the
more
energetic
and
intelligent
of
their
retainers
most
of
whom
were
of
no
rank
or
position
these
men
it
was
who
really
ruled
the
clan
determined
the
policy
of
its
head
and
dictated
to
him
the
language
he
should
use
on
public
occasions
the
it
can
not
be
too
often
repeated
was
a
nobody
he
possessed
not
even
as
much
power
as
a
constitutional
sovereign
of
the
modern
type
and
his
intellect
owing
to
his
education
was
nearly
always
far
below
par
this
strange
political
system
was
enabled
to
hold
together
solely
by
the
isolation
of
the
country
from
the
outer
world
as
soon
as
the
fresh
air
of
european
thought
impinged
upon
this
framework
it
crumbled
to
ashes
like
an
egyptian
mummy
brought
out
of
its
sarcophagus
the
decline
of
the
mikado
power
dates
from
the
middle
of
the
century
when
for
the
first
time
a
boy
of
nine
years
ascended
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
during
his
minority
the
country
was
governed
by
his
the
chief
of
the
ancient
fujiwara
family
who
contrived
for
a
long
period
to
secure
to
themselves
the
power
of
setting
up
and
removing
their
own
nominees
just
as
suited
their
convenience
a
similar
fate
befel
the
institution
of
the
shôgunate
after
the
murder
of
yoritomo
last
surviving
son
the
country
was
nominally
ruled
by
a
succession
of
young
princes
none
of
whom
had
emerged
from
the
stage
of
boyhood
when
appointed
and
who
were
deposed
in
turn
after
a
few
years
of
complete
nullity
while
the
real
heads
of
the
government
were
the
descendants
of
hôjô
tokimasa
yoritomo
the
vices
of
the
hereditary
principle
in
their
case
had
again
full
sway
and
the
later
hôjô
were
mere
puppets
in
the
hands
of
their
principal
advisers
a
revolution
in
favour
of
the
mikado
overthrew
this
system
for
a
short
interval
until
the
shôgunate
was
restored
for
a
time
to
reality
by
the
founder
of
the
ashikaga
family
but
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
years
its
power
was
divided
between
kiôto
and
kamakura
and
the
two
heads
of
the
family
fell
under
the
dominating
influence
of
their
agents
the
uyésugi
and
hosokawa
towards
the
end
of
the
ashikaga
period
the
shôgun
had
become
as
much
an
empty
name
as
the
mikado
himself
and
the
country
was
split
up
among
the
local
chieftains
the
bad
condition
of
the
internal
communications
between
the
provinces
and
the
capital
probably
contributed
to
this
state
of
things
iyéyasu
was
the
first
to
render
consolidation
possible
by
the
construction
of
good
military
roads
the
governmental
system
erected
by
him
seemed
calculated
to
ensure
the
lasting
tranquillity
of
the
country
but
the
hereditary
principle
again
reasserted
its
influence
the
third
shôgun
iyémitsu
was
a
real
man
born
four
years
after
the
battle
of
sekigahara
and
already
twelve
years
of
age
when
his
grandfather
died
in
the
year
succeeding
his
final
appearance
in
the
battlefield
he
had
the
education
of
a
soldier
and
to
his
energy
was
owing
the
final
establishment
of
the
tokugawa
supremacy
on
a
solid
basis
iyéyasu
and
his
successor
had
always
been
in
the
habit
of
meeting
the
on
their
visits
to
yedo
outside
the
city
iyémitsu
received
them
in
his
palace
he
gave
those
who
would
not
submit
to
their
changed
position
the
option
of
returning
home
and
offered
them
three
years
for
preparation
to
try
the
ordeal
of
war
not
a
single
one
ventured
to
resist
but
he
was
succeeded
by
his
son
iyétsuna
a
boy
of
ten
during
minority
the
government
was
carried
on
in
his
name
by
his
council
of
state
composed
of
hereditary
servants
and
the
personal
authority
of
the
head
of
the
tokugawa
family
thus
received
its
first
serious
blow
but
worse
than
that
the
office
of
chief
councillor
was
from
the
first
confined
to
four
baronial
families
ii
honda
sakakibara
and
sakai
and
the
rôjiû
or
ordinary
councillors
were
likewise
on
them
the
hereditary
principle
had
in
the
interval
between
the
close
of
the
civil
wars
and
the
accession
of
the
fourth
shôgun
produced
its
usual
result
nominally
the
heads
of
the
administration
they
were
without
any
will
of
their
own
and
were
guided
by
their
own
hereditary
councillors
whose
strings
were
pulled
by
someone
else
the
real
power
then
fell
into
the
hands
of
ministers
or
chosen
from
the
or
lesser
vassals
and
many
of
these
were
men
of
influence
and
real
weight
still
with
them
the
habit
of
delegating
authority
into
the
hands
of
anyone
of
sufficient
industry
and
energy
to
prefer
work
to
idleness
was
invincible
and
in
the
end
the
dominions
of
the
tokugawa
family
came
to
be
ruled
by
the
or
private
secretaries
the
machine
in
fact
had
been
so
skilfully
constructed
that
a
child
could
keep
it
turning
political
stagnation
was
mistaken
for
stability
apart
from
one
or
two
unsuccessful
conspiracies
against
the
government
japan
experienced
during
years
the
profoundest
tranquillity
she
resembled
the
sleeping
beauty
in
the
wood
and
the
guardians
of
the
public
safety
had
a
task
not
more
onerous
than
that
of
waving
a
fan
to
keep
the
flies
from
disturbing
the
princess
slumbers
when
her
dreams
were
interrupted
by
the
eager
and
vigorous
west
the
ancient
decrepit
and
wrinkled
watchers
were
found
unfit
for
their
posts
and
had
to
give
way
to
men
more
fit
to
cope
with
the
altered
circumstances
which
surrounded
them
socially
the
nation
was
divided
into
two
sections
by
a
wide
gulf
which
it
was
impossible
to
pass
on
the
one
hand
the
families
or
gentry
whose
frequent
poverty
was
compensated
for
by
their
privileges
of
rank
on
the
other
the
agricultural
labouring
and
commercial
classes
intermarriage
was
forbidden
between
the
orders
the
former
were
ruled
by
the
code
of
honour
offences
against
which
were
permitted
to
be
expiated
by
the
famous
or
disembowelment
while
the
latter
were
subject
to
a
severe
unwritten
law
enforced
by
cruel
and
frequent
capital
punishment
they
were
the
obedient
humble
servants
of
the
class
japan
had
already
made
the
experiment
of
free
intercourse
with
european
states
in
the
middle
of
the
century
when
the
merchants
and
missionaries
of
portugal
were
welcomed
in
the
chief
ports
of
and
christianity
bade
fair
to
replace
the
ancient
native
religions
they
were
succeeded
by
the
spaniards
dutch
and
english
the
two
latter
nations
confining
themselves
however
to
commerce
the
gigantic
missionary
undertakings
of
the
two
great
communities
of
the
far
west
were
the
creation
of
a
much
later
time
it
will
be
recollected
that
in
spain
for
a
time
absorbed
portugal
the
roman
catholics
began
before
long
to
excite
the
enmity
of
the
buddhist
and
shintô
priesthood
whose
temples
they
had
caused
to
be
pulled
down
and
whose
revenues
they
seemed
on
the
point
of
usurping
nobunaga
had
favoured
them
but
in
the
civil
wars
that
raged
at
that
period
the
principal
patrons
of
the
jesuits
were
overthrown
and
the
new
ruler
taicosama
soon
proclaimed
his
hostility
to
the
strangers
their
worst
offence
was
the
refusal
of
a
christian
girl
to
become
his
concubine
iyéyasu
a
devout
buddhist
pursued
the
same
religious
policy
as
his
predecessor
in
possession
of
the
ruling
power
his
dislike
to
christianity
was
stimulated
by
the
fact
that
some
of
adherents
were
christians
and
the
young
prince
hidéyori
was
himself
known
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
the
missionaries
the
flame
was
fanned
by
the
dutch
and
english
now
become
the
hereditary
political
foes
of
spain
and
the
persecution
was
renewed
with
greater
vigour
than
ever
missionaries
were
sought
out
with
eager
keenness
and
in
the
company
of
their
disciples
subjected
to
cruel
tortures
and
the
most
horrible
deaths
the
fury
of
persecution
did
not
relax
with
disappearance
from
the
scene
and
the
final
act
of
the
drama
was
played
out
in
the
time
of
his
grandson
an
insurrection
provoked
by
the
oppression
of
the
local
broke
out
in
the
island
of
amakusa
where
thousands
of
christians
joined
the
rebel
flag
after
a
furious
struggle
the
revolt
was
put
an
end
to
on
the
february
by
the
assault
and
capture
of
the
castle
of
shimabara
when
people
of
whom
were
women
and
children
were
put
to
the
sword
it
is
hardly
possible
to
read
the
native
accounts
of
this
business
without
a
feeling
of
choking
indignation
at
the
ruthless
sacrifice
of
so
many
unfortunate
creatures
who
were
incapable
of
defence
and
whose
only
crime
was
their
wish
to
serve
the
religion
which
they
had
chosen
for
their
rule
of
life
the
portuguese
were
forbidden
ever
to
set
foot
again
in
japan
the
english
had
previously
retired
from
a
commercial
contest
in
which
they
found
their
rivals
too
fortunate
and
too
skilful
and
the
edict
went
forth
that
the
dutch
who
now
alone
remained
should
thenceforth
be
confined
to
the
small
artificial
island
of
déshima
off
the
town
of
nagasaki
where
for
the
next
centuries
they
and
the
chinese
were
permitted
to
carry
on
a
restricted
and
constantly
diminishing
trade
attempts
were
made
once
or
twice
by
the
english
and
early
in
the
present
century
by
the
russians
to
induce
the
government
of
japan
to
relax
their
rule
but
in
vain
the
only
profit
the
world
has
derived
from
these
abortive
essays
is
the
entrancing
narrative
of
golownin
who
was
taken
prisoner
in
yezo
in
connection
with
a
descent
made
by
russian
naval
officers
in
revenge
for
the
rejection
of
the
overtures
made
by
the
russian
envoy
resanoff
perhaps
the
most
lifelike
picture
of
japanese
official
manners
that
is
anywhere
to
be
met
with
no
further
approaches
were
made
by
any
western
government
until
the
united
states
took
the
matter
in
hand
in
chapter
iv
treaties
spirit
murder
of
foreigners
the
expedition
of
commodore
perry
to
loochoo
and
japan
was
not
the
first
enterprise
of
its
kind
that
had
been
undertaken
by
the
americans
having
accomplished
their
own
independence
as
the
result
of
a
contest
in
which
a
few
millions
of
colonists
had
successfully
withstood
the
legions
of
great
britain
and
her
german
mercenaries
though
not
it
may
be
fairly
said
without
in
a
great
measure
owing
their
success
to
the
very
efficient
assistance
of
french
armies
and
fleets
they
added
to
this
memory
of
ancient
wrongs
a
natural
for
other
nations
who
were
less
able
to
resist
the
might
of
the
greatest
commercial
and
maritime
power
the
world
has
yet
seen
while
sympathising
with
eastern
peoples
in
the
defence
of
their
independent
rights
they
believed
that
a
conciliatory
mode
of
treating
them
was
at
least
equally
well
fitted
to
ensure
the
concession
of
those
trading
privileges
to
which
the
americans
are
not
less
indifferent
than
the
english
in
they
had
despatched
an
envoy
to
siam
and
who
was
successful
in
negotiating
by
peaceful
methods
a
treaty
of
commerce
with
the
former
state
in
china
like
the
other
western
states
they
had
profited
by
the
negotiations
which
were
the
outcome
of
the
opium
war
without
having
to
incur
the
odium
of
using
force
or
the
humiliation
of
finding
their
softer
methods
prove
a
failure
in
dealing
with
the
obstinate
conservatism
of
chinese
mandarins
for
many
years
their
eyes
had
been
bent
upon
japan
which
lay
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
pacific
fronting
their
own
state
of
california
then
rising
into
fame
as
one
of
the
great
regions
of
the
globe
warned
by
the
fate
of
all
previous
attempts
to
break
down
the
wall
of
seclusion
that
hemmed
in
the
of
the
gods
they
resolved
to
make
such
a
show
of
force
that
with
reasonable
people
unfamiliar
with
modern
artillery
might
prove
as
powerful
an
argument
as
theories
of
universal
brotherhood
and
the
obligations
imposed
by
the
comity
of
nations
they
appointed
to
the
chief
command
a
naval
officer
possessed
of
both
tact
and
determination
whose
judicious
use
of
the
former
qualification
rendered
the
employ
of
the
second
unnecessary
probably
no
one
was
more
agreeably
surprised
than
commodore
perry
at
the
comparative
ease
with
which
on
his
second
visit
to
the
bay
of
yedo
he
obtained
a
treaty
satisfactory
enough
as
a
beginning
no
doubt
the
counsels
of
the
dutch
agent
at
nagasaki
were
not
without
their
effect
and
we
may
also
conjecture
that
the
desire
which
had
already
begun
to
manifest
itself
among
some
of
the
lower
for
a
wider
acquaintance
with
the
mysterious
outer
world
was
secretly
shared
by
men
in
high
positions
fear
alone
would
not
have
induced
a
haughty
government
like
that
of
the
shôguns
to
acquiesce
in
breaking
through
a
law
of
restriction
that
had
such
a
highly
creditable
antiquity
to
boast
of
most
men
motives
are
mixed
and
there
was
on
the
japanese
side
no
very
decided
unwillingness
to
yield
to
a
show
of
force
which
the
pretext
of
prudence
would
enable
them
to
justify
england
and
russia
then
or
shortly
afterwards
at
war
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
united
states
next
an
american
took
up
his
residence
at
shimoda
to
look
after
the
interests
of
whaling
vessels
and
skilfully
made
use
of
the
recent
events
in
china
to
induce
the
shôgun
government
to
extend
the
concessions
already
granted
in
the
china
war
having
been
apparently
brought
to
a
successful
conclusion
lord
elgin
and
the
french
ambassador
baron
gros
ran
across
to
japan
and
concluded
treaties
on
the
same
basis
as
harris
and
before
long
similar
privileges
were
accorded
to
holland
and
russia
in
the
ports
of
nagasaki
hakodaté
and
yokohama
were
thrown
open
to
the
trade
of
the
five
powers
and
a
new
age
was
inaugurated
in
japan
it
was
not
without
opposition
that
the
shôgun
government
had
entered
into
its
first
engagements
with
the
united
states
great
britain
and
russia
an
agitation
arose
when
the
first
american
ships
anchored
in
the
bay
of
yedo
and
there
were
not
wanting
bold
and
rash
men
ready
to
undertake
any
desperate
enterprise
against
the
foreign
invaders
of
the
sacred
soil
of
japan
but
at
this
time
there
was
no
leader
to
whom
the
malcontents
could
turn
for
guidance
the
mikado
was
closely
watched
by
the
shôgun
resident
at
kiôto
and
the
were
divided
among
themselves
the
principal
opponent
was
the
of
mito
whose
constitutional
duty
was
to
support
the
shôgun
and
aid
him
with
his
counsels
in
all
great
national
crises
during
the
presence
of
commodore
perry
the
reigning
shôgun
iyéyoshi
had
fallen
ill
and
he
died
not
long
after
the
squadron
had
sailed
he
was
succeeded
by
his
son
iyésada
a
man
of
who
does
not
seem
to
have
been
endowed
with
either
force
of
character
or
knowledge
of
the
world
such
qualities
are
not
to
be
expected
from
the
kind
of
education
which
fell
to
the
lot
of
japanese
princes
in
those
days
in
view
of
the
expected
return
of
the
american
ships
in
the
following
year
forts
were
constructed
to
guard
the
of
the
capital
and
the
of
mito
was
summoned
from
his
retirement
to
take
the
lead
in
preparing
to
resist
the
encroachments
of
foreign
powers
by
a
curious
coincidence
this
nobleman
then
years
of
age
was
the
representative
of
a
family
which
for
years
had
maintained
the
theoretical
right
of
the
mikado
to
exercise
the
supreme
government
and
was
at
the
same
time
strongly
opposed
to
any
extension
of
the
limited
intercourse
with
foreign
countries
then
permitted
nor
can
it
be
wondered
that
japan
who
had
so
successfully
protected
herself
from
foreign
aggression
by
a
policy
of
rigid
exclusion
and
which
had
seen
the
humiliation
of
china
consequent
upon
disputes
with
a
western
power
arising
out
of
trade
questions
at
the
very
moment
when
she
was
being
torn
by
a
civil
war
which
owed
its
origin
to
the
introduction
of
new
religious
beliefs
from
the
west
should
have
believed
that
the
best
means
of
maintaining
peace
at
home
and
avoiding
an
unequal
contest
with
europe
was
to
adhere
strictly
to
the
traditions
of
the
past
two
centuries
but
when
the
intrusive
foreigners
returned
in
the
beginning
of
the
following
year
japan
found
herself
still
unprepared
to
repel
them
by
force
the
treaty
was
therefore
signed
interdicting
trade
but
permitting
whalers
to
obtain
supplies
in
the
three
harbours
of
nagasaki
hakodaté
and
shimoda
and
promising
friendly
treatment
to
shipwrecked
sailors
while
making
these
unavoidable
concessions
the
japanese
buoyed
themselves
up
with
the
belief
that
their
innate
superiority
could
enable
them
easily
to
overcome
the
better
equipped
forces
of
foreign
countries
when
once
they
had
acquired
the
modern
arts
of
warfare
and
provided
themselves
with
a
sufficient
proportion
of
the
ships
and
weapons
of
the
nineteenth
century
from
that
time
onwards
this
was
the
central
idea
of
japan
foreign
policy
for
many
years
as
the
sequel
will
show
even
at
this
period
there
were
a
few
who
would
have
willingly
started
off
on
this
new
quest
and
two
japanese
actually
asked
commodore
perry
to
give
them
a
passage
in
his
flagship
they
were
refused
and
their
zeal
was
punished
by
their
own
government
with
imprisonment
the
residence
of
harris
at
shimoda
and
the
visit
which
he
insisted
on
paying
to
the
capital
created
fresh
difficulties
for
the
advisers
of
the
shôgun
written
protests
were
delivered
by
members
of
his
council
and
he
was
obliged
at
last
to
ask
the
mikado
sanction
to
the
treaties
in
order
to
strengthen
his
own
position
this
invocation
of
the
authority
may
fairly
be
called
an
innovation
upon
ancient
custom
neither
nobunaga
hidéyoshi
nor
iyéyasu
had
thought
it
necessary
to
get
their
acts
approved
by
him
and
iyéyasu
granted
trade
privileges
entirely
on
his
own
responsibility
without
his
right
to
do
so
ever
being
questioned
this
reference
to
kiôto
is
the
first
sign
of
the
decadence
of
the
shôgun
power
the
supremacy
of
the
mikado
having
been
once
admitted
his
right
to
a
voice
in
the
affairs
of
the
country
could
no
longer
be
disputed
his
nobles
seized
the
opportunity
and
assumed
the
attitude
of
obstruction
which
has
always
been
a
powerful
weapon
in
the
hands
of
individuals
and
parties
one
man
out
of
a
dozen
of
sufficient
determination
can
always
force
the
others
to
yield
when
his
position
is
legal
and
can
not
be
disturbed
by
the
use
of
force
on
the
one
hand
harris
pressed
for
a
revision
of
the
treaty
and
the
concession
of
open
ports
at
kanagawa
and
ozaka
on
the
other
was
the
court
turning
an
obstinately
deaf
ear
to
all
proposals
in
its
desperation
the
shôgun
government
appointed
to
be
prime
minister
or
regent
as
he
was
called
by
foreigners
the
descendant
of
iyéyasu
most
trusted
retainer
the
ii
kamon
no
kami
of
hikoné
and
harris
as
has
already
been
said
skilfully
turning
to
account
the
recent
exploits
of
the
combined
english
and
french
squadrons
in
the
chinese
seas
obtained
his
treaty
achieving
a
diplomatic
triumph
of
the
greatest
value
purely
by
the
use
of
moral
pressure
the
english
french
russian
and
dutch
treaties
followed
the
shôgun
stood
committed
to
a
policy
from
which
his
new
allies
were
not
likely
to
allow
of
his
receding
while
to
the
party
was
imparted
a
consistency
that
there
had
previously
been
little
chance
of
its
acquiring
scarcely
was
the
ink
of
these
engagements
dry
when
the
shôgun
who
had
been
indisposed
for
some
weeks
past
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
leaving
no
heir
according
to
the
custom
which
had
been
observed
on
two
previous
occasions
when
there
had
been
a
break
in
the
direct
line
a
prince
was
chosen
from
the
house
of
to
be
his
successor
the
of
mito
and
several
of
his
sympathisers
among
the
leading
nobles
namely
hizen
owari
tosa
satsuma
and
the
daté
of
uwajima
a
man
of
abilities
superior
to
the
size
of
his
tiny
fief
in
shikoku
had
desired
to
choose
a
younger
son
of
mito
who
had
been
adopted
into
the
family
of
hitotsubashi
but
the
prime
minister
was
too
strong
for
them
he
insisted
on
the
election
of
his
own
nominee
and
forced
his
opponents
to
retire
into
private
life
thus
to
their
disapproval
of
the
political
course
adopted
by
the
shôgunate
was
added
a
personal
resentment
against
its
chief
minister
and
this
feeling
was
shared
in
a
remarkable
degree
by
the
retainers
of
the
disgraced
nobles
a
bloody
revenge
was
taken
two
years
later
on
the
individual
but
the
hostility
to
the
system
only
increased
with
time
and
in
the
end
brought
about
its
complete
ruin
mito
was
the
ringleader
of
the
opposition
and
began
actively
to
intrigue
with
the
mikado
party
against
the
head
of
his
own
family
the
foreigners
arrived
in
numbers
at
kanagawa
and
yokohama
and
affronted
the
feelings
of
the
haughty
by
their
independent
demeanour
so
different
from
the
cringing
subservience
to
which
the
rules
of
japanese
etiquette
condemned
the
native
merchant
it
was
not
long
before
blood
was
shed
on
the
evening
of
the
august
six
weeks
after
the
establishment
at
yedo
of
the
british
and
american
representatives
an
officer
and
a
seaman
belonging
to
a
russian
were
cut
to
pieces
in
the
streets
of
yokohama
where
they
had
landed
to
buy
provisions
in
november
a
chinese
servant
belonging
to
the
french
was
attacked
and
killed
in
the
foreign
settlement
at
yokohama
two
months
later
sir
alcock
native
linguist
of
the
british
legation
was
stabbed
from
behind
as
he
was
standing
at
the
gateway
of
the
british
legation
in
yedo
and
within
a
month
more
two
dutch
merchant
captains
were
slaughtered
in
the
high
street
at
yokohama
then
there
was
a
lull
for
eight
or
nine
months
till
the
french
minister
servant
was
cut
at
and
badly
wounded
as
he
was
standing
at
the
gate
of
the
legation
in
yedo
on
the
january
heusken
the
secretary
of
the
american
mission
was
attacked
and
murdered
as
he
was
riding
home
after
a
at
the
prussian
legation
and
on
the
night
of
july
occurred
the
boldest
attempt
yet
made
on
the
life
of
foreigners
when
the
british
legation
was
attacked
by
a
band
of
armed
men
and
as
stoutly
defended
by
the
native
guard
this
was
a
considerable
catalogue
for
a
period
of
no
more
than
two
years
since
the
opening
of
the
ports
to
commerce
in
every
case
the
attack
was
premeditated
and
unprovoked
and
the
perpetrators
on
every
occasion
belonged
to
the
swordbearing
class
no
offence
had
been
given
by
the
victims
to
those
who
had
thus
ruthlessly
cut
them
down
they
were
assassinated
from
motives
of
a
political
character
and
their
murderers
went
unpunished
in
every
instance
japan
became
to
be
known
as
a
country
where
the
foreigner
carried
his
life
in
his
hand
and
the
dread
of
incurring
the
fate
of
which
so
many
examples
had
already
occurred
became
general
among
the
residents
even
in
england
before
i
left
to
take
up
my
appointment
we
felt
that
apart
from
the
chances
of
climate
the
risk
of
coming
to
an
untimely
end
at
the
hands
of
an
expert
swordsman
must
be
taken
into
account
consequently
i
bought
a
revolver
with
a
due
supply
of
powder
bullets
and
caps
the
trade
to
japan
in
these
weapons
must
have
been
very
great
in
those
days
as
everyone
wore
a
pistol
whenever
he
ventured
beyond
the
limits
of
the
foreign
settlement
and
constantly
slept
with
one
under
his
pillow
it
was
a
busy
time
for
colt
and
adams
but
in
all
the
years
of
my
experience
in
japan
i
never
heard
of
more
than
one
life
being
taken
by
a
revolver
and
that
was
when
a
frenchman
shot
a
carpenter
who
demanded
payment
for
his
labour
in
a
somewhat
too
demonstrative
manner
in
yedo
i
think
we
finally
gave
up
wearing
revolvers
in
chiefly
because
the
few
of
us
who
resided
there
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
weight
of
the
weapon
was
inconvenient
and
also
that
if
any
bloodthirsty
gentleman
intended
to
take
our
lives
he
would
choose
his
time
and
opportunity
so
as
to
leave
us
no
chance
of
anticipating
his
purpose
with
a
bullet
in
the
spring
of
sir
rutherford
alcock
returned
to
england
on
leave
of
absence
and
colonel
neale
was
left
in
charge
as
i
have
said
before
disbelieving
in
the
validity
of
the
reasons
which
had
led
the
minister
to
remove
his
official
residence
to
yokohama
the
chargé
reestablished
himself
at
the
temple
formerly
occupied
as
the
british
legation
on
the
anniversary
according
to
the
japanese
calendar
of
the
attack
referred
to
on
a
previous
page
some
commissioners
for
foreign
affairs
in
calling
upon
colonel
neale
congratulated
him
and
themselves
on
the
fact
that
a
whole
year
had
elapsed
since
any
fresh
attempt
had
been
made
on
the
life
of
a
foreigner
it
was
not
unnatural
therefore
that
in
the
first
impulse
of
indignation
at
the
savage
and
bloody
slaughter
of
the
sentry
and
corporal
almost
at
his
bedroom
door
he
should
have
conceived
the
suspicion
that
the
visit
of
the
commissioners
and
their
language
in
the
morning
had
been
intended
to
put
him
off
his
guard
and
that
consequently
the
japanese
government
or
rather
the
shôgun
ministers
were
implicated
in
what
looked
like
a
barbarous
act
of
treachery
that
deprived
the
japanese
nation
of
all
right
to
be
regarded
as
a
civilized
community
more
especially
as
the
native
watch
had
been
recently
changed
and
fresh
men
substituted
for
those
who
had
fought
so
well
in
defence
of
sir
rutherford
alcock
the
year
before
but
on
reflection
it
will
easily
be
seen
that
there
was
no
real
justification
for
such
a
belief
the
assassin
was
one
of
the
guard
after
the
murder
of
the
two
englishmen
he
returned
to
his
quarters
and
there
committed
suicide
by
ripping
himself
up
in
the
approved
japanese
fashion
we
may
be
sure
that
if
his
act
had
been
the
result
of
a
conspiracy
he
would
not
have
been
alone
ignorant
as
the
ministers
may
have
been
and
probably
were
of
the
sacred
character
of
an
envoy
it
was
not
their
interest
to
bring
upon
themselves
the
armed
vengeance
of
foreign
powers
at
a
moment
when
they
were
confronted
with
the
active
enmity
of
the
principal
clans
of
the
west
i
think
they
may
be
entirely
absolved
from
all
share
in
this
attempt
to
massacre
the
inmates
of
the
english
legation
but
on
the
other
hand
it
seems
highly
probable
that
the
man
comrades
were
aware
of
his
intention
and
that
after
his
partial
success
they
connived
at
his
escape
but
he
had
been
wounded
by
a
bullet
discharged
from
the
pistol
of
the
second
man
whom
he
attacked
and
drops
of
blood
on
the
ground
showed
the
route
by
which
he
had
made
his
way
out
of
the
garden
as
his
identity
could
not
be
concealed
he
had
to
commit
suicide
in
order
to
anticipate
the
penalty
of
death
which
the
shôgun
government
could
not
have
avoided
inflicting
on
him
the
apparent
cognisance
of
the
other
men
on
guard
who
were
what
our
law
would
call
accessories
before
the
fact
and
the
fact
that
nevertheless
they
took
no
share
in
his
act
is
consonant
with
the
statement
that
he
was
merely
accomplishing
an
act
of
private
revenge
his
selection
of
the
darkness
of
night
seems
to
indicate
that
he
hoped
to
escape
the
consequences
willis
said
that
when
he
arose
and
looked
out
the
night
was
pitch
dark
it
was
the
night
before
full
moon
and
in
the
very
middle
of
what
is
called
in
japan
the
rainy
season
he
informed
me
that
there
was
a
high
wind
and
that
heavy
black
clouds
were
drifting
over
the
sky
the
stormy
weather
and
the
lateness
of
the
hour
to
might
perhaps
account
for
the
native
lanterns
which
were
hung
about
the
grounds
having
ceased
to
give
any
light
but
even
under
those
circumstances
it
is
a
little
suspicious
that
the
guard
should
have
neglected
to
replace
the
burnt
out
candles
it
was
at
taku
on
our
way
down
from
peking
that
robertson
jamieson
and
i
heard
of
this
new
attack
on
the
legation
i
believe
our
feeling
was
rather
one
of
regret
that
we
had
lost
the
opportunity
of
experiencing
one
of
the
stirring
events
which
we
had
already
learnt
to
regard
as
normally
characteristic
of
life
in
japan
it
certainly
did
not
take
us
by
surprise
and
in
no
way
rendered
the
service
less
attractive
but
jamieson
had
found
a
better
opening
in
shanghai
and
the
remaining
two
went
on
to
yokohama
as
soon
as
they
could
get
a
passage
chapter
v
richardson
murder
japanese
studies
the
day
after
my
arrival
at
yokohama
i
was
taken
over
to
kanagawa
and
introduced
to
the
rev
brown
an
american
missionary
who
was
then
engaged
in
printing
a
work
on
colloquial
japanese
and
to
dr
hepburn
who
was
employed
on
a
dictionary
of
the
language
the
former
died
some
years
ago
but
the
latter
is
at
this
moment
still
in
japan
bringing
out
the
third
edition
of
his
invaluable
lexicon
and
completing
the
translation
of
the
bible
on
which
he
has
been
occupied
for
many
years
in
those
days
we
had
either
to
take
a
native
sculling
boat
for
an
across
the
bay
to
kanagawa
or
ride
round
by
the
causeway
the
land
along
which
the
railway
now
runs
not
having
been
filled
in
at
that
time
natives
used
to
cross
by
a
public
ferry
boat
paying
a
to
the
but
no
foreigner
was
ever
allowed
to
make
use
of
the
cheaper
conveyance
if
he
was
quick
enough
to
catch
the
ferryboat
before
it
had
pushed
off
and
so
seize
a
place
for
himself
the
boatmen
simply
refused
to
stir
they
remained
immovable
until
the
intruder
was
tired
of
waiting
and
abandoned
the
game
it
was
only
after
a
residence
of
some
years
when
i
had
become
pretty
fluent
in
the
language
and
could
argue
the
point
with
the
certainty
of
having
the
public
on
my
side
that
i
at
last
succeeded
in
overcoming
the
obstinacy
of
the
people
at
the
boathouse
who
had
the
monopoly
of
carrying
foreigners
there
was
in
those
days
a
fixed
price
for
the
foreigner
wherever
he
went
arbitrarily
determined
without
reference
to
the
native
tariff
at
the
theatre
a
foreigner
had
to
pay
an
for
admittance
and
was
then
thrust
into
the
as
the
gallery
seats
are
called
which
are
so
far
from
the
stage
that
the
actors
speeches
are
quite
indistinguishable
the
best
place
for
both
seeing
and
hearing
is
the
on
the
area
of
the
theatre
close
in
front
of
the
stage
on
one
occasion
i
walked
into
the
theatre
and
took
my
place
in
one
of
the
divisions
of
the
offering
to
pay
the
regular
price
no
they
would
not
take
it
i
must
pay
my
and
go
to
the
foreigner
box
i
held
out
insisting
on
my
right
as
one
of
the
public
did
i
not
squat
on
the
floor
with
my
boots
off
just
like
themselves
well
then
if
i
would
not
come
out
of
that
the
curtain
would
not
rise
i
rejoined
that
they
might
please
themselves
about
that
in
order
to
annoy
a
single
foreigner
they
would
deprive
the
rest
of
the
spectators
of
the
pleasure
they
had
paid
to
enjoy
so
i
obstinately
kept
my
place
and
in
the
end
the
manager
gave
way
the
house
was
amused
at
the
foreigner
speaking
their
language
and
getting
the
best
of
the
argument
and
for
the
rest
of
my
time
in
yokohama
i
had
no
more
difficulty
in
obtaining
accommodation
in
any
part
of
the
theatre
that
i
preferred
dr
hepburn
died
in
in
those
days
the
yokohama
theatre
used
to
begin
about
eleven
in
the
morning
and
keep
open
for
twelve
hours
a
favourite
play
was
the
or
of
faithful
and
the
or
the
plate
the
arrangement
of
the
interior
the
fashion
of
dress
and
acting
the
primitive
character
of
the
scenery
and
lights
the
literary
style
of
the
plays
have
not
undergone
any
changes
and
are
very
unlikely
to
be
modified
in
any
marked
degree
by
contact
with
european
ideas
there
is
some
talk
now
and
then
of
elevating
the
character
of
the
stage
and
making
the
theatre
a
school
of
morals
and
manners
for
the
young
but
the
good
people
who
advocate
these
theories
in
the
press
have
not
as
far
as
i
know
ventured
to
put
them
to
practical
proof
and
the
will
i
hope
always
continue
to
be
what
it
always
has
been
in
japan
a
place
of
amusement
and
distraction
where
people
of
all
ages
and
sizes
go
to
enjoy
themselves
without
caring
one
atom
whether
the
incidents
are
probable
or
proper
so
long
as
there
is
enough
of
the
tragic
to
call
forth
the
tears
which
every
natural
man
sheds
with
satisfaction
on
proper
occasions
and
of
the
comic
to
give
the
facial
muscles
a
stretch
in
the
other
direction
on
the
september
a
most
barbarous
murder
was
committed
on
a
shanghai
merchant
named
richardson
he
in
company
with
a
mrs
borradaile
of
hongkong
and
woodthorpe
clarke
and
wm
marshall
both
of
yokohama
were
riding
along
the
high
road
between
kanagawa
and
kawasaki
when
they
met
with
a
train
of
retainers
who
bid
them
stand
aside
they
passed
on
at
the
edge
of
the
road
until
they
came
in
sight
of
a
palanquin
occupied
by
shimadzu
saburô
father
of
the
prince
of
satsuma
they
were
now
ordered
to
turn
back
and
as
they
were
wheeling
their
horses
in
obedience
were
suddenly
set
upon
by
several
armed
men
belonging
to
the
train
who
hacked
at
them
with
their
heavy
swords
richardson
fell
from
his
horse
in
a
dying
state
and
the
other
two
men
were
so
severely
wounded
that
they
called
out
to
the
lady
ride
on
we
can
do
nothing
for
you
she
got
safely
back
to
yokohama
and
gave
the
alarm
everybody
in
the
settlement
who
possessed
a
pony
and
a
revolver
at
once
armed
himself
and
galloped
off
towards
the
scene
of
slaughter
vyse
the
british
consul
led
off
the
legation
mounted
escort
in
spite
of
colonel
neale
order
that
they
should
not
move
until
he
or
their
own
commander
gave
the
word
de
bellecourt
the
french
minister
sent
out
his
escort
consisting
of
a
french
troopers
lieut
price
of
the
regiment
marched
off
part
of
the
legation
guard
accompanied
by
some
french
infantry
but
amongst
the
first
perhaps
the
very
first
of
all
was
dr
willis
whose
high
sense
of
the
duty
cast
on
him
by
his
profession
rendered
him
absolutely
fearless
passing
for
a
mile
along
the
ranks
of
the
men
whose
swords
were
reeking
with
the
blood
of
englishmen
he
rode
along
the
high
road
through
kanagawa
where
he
was
joined
by
some
three
or
four
more
englishmen
he
proceeded
onwards
to
namamugi
where
poor
richardson
corpse
was
found
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
by
the
roadside
his
throat
had
been
cut
as
he
was
lying
there
wounded
and
helpless
the
body
was
covered
with
sword
cuts
any
one
of
which
was
sufficient
to
cause
death
it
was
carried
thence
to
the
american
consulate
in
kanagawa
where
clarke
and
marshall
had
found
refuge
and
surgical
aid
at
the
hands
of
dr
hepburn
and
later
on
of
dr
jenkins
our
other
doctor
there
was
only
one
british
lying
in
the
harbour
but
in
the
course
of
the
evening
admiral
küper
arrived
in
his
flagship
the
with
the
the
excitement
among
the
foreign
mercantile
community
was
intense
for
this
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
one
of
their
own
number
had
been
struck
down
the
japanese
sword
is
as
sharp
as
a
razor
and
inflicts
fearful
gashes
the
japanese
had
a
way
of
cutting
a
man
to
pieces
rather
than
leave
any
life
in
him
this
had
a
most
powerful
effect
on
the
minds
of
europeans
who
came
to
look
on
every
man
as
a
probable
assassin
and
if
they
met
one
in
the
street
thanked
god
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
him
and
found
themselves
in
safety
it
was
known
that
shimadzu
saburô
was
to
lie
that
night
at
hodogaya
a
scarcely
two
miles
from
yokohama
to
surround
and
seize
him
with
the
united
forces
of
all
the
foreign
vessels
in
port
would
in
their
opinion
have
been
both
easy
and
justifiable
and
viewed
by
the
light
of
our
later
knowledge
not
only
of
japanese
politics
but
also
of
japanese
ideas
with
regard
to
the
right
of
taking
redress
they
were
not
far
wrong
in
the
absence
of
any
organised
police
or
military
force
able
to
keep
order
among
the
turbulent
class
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
this
course
would
have
been
adopted
by
any
japanese
clan
against
whom
such
an
offence
had
been
committed
and
the
foreign
nationalities
in
japan
were
in
the
same
position
as
a
native
clan
they
were
subject
to
the
authorities
of
their
own
country
who
had
jurisdiction
over
them
both
in
criminal
and
civil
matters
and
were
responsible
for
keeping
them
within
the
bounds
of
law
and
for
their
protection
against
attack
a
meeting
was
called
at
hooper
clarke
partner
house
under
the
presidency
of
colonel
howard
vyse
the
british
consul
when
after
an
earnest
discussion
and
the
rejection
of
a
motion
to
request
the
foreign
naval
authorities
to
land
men
in
order
to
arrest
the
guilty
parties
a
deputation
consisting
of
some
of
the
leading
residents
was
appointed
to
wait
on
the
commanding
officers
of
the
dutch
french
and
english
naval
forces
and
lay
before
them
the
conclusions
of
the
meeting
the
british
admiral
however
declined
to
act
upon
their
suggestion
but
consented
to
attend
another
meeting
which
was
to
be
held
at
the
residence
of
the
french
minister
at
on
the
following
morning
the
deputation
then
went
to
colonel
neale
who
with
great
magnanimity
waived
all
personal
considerations
and
promised
to
be
present
also
the
idea
had
got
abroad
amongst
the
foreign
community
that
colonel
neale
could
not
be
trusted
to
take
the
energetic
measures
which
they
considered
necessary
under
the
circumstances
in
fact
they
found
fault
with
him
for
preserving
the
cool
bearing
which
might
be
expected
from
a
man
who
had
seen
actual
service
in
the
field
and
which
especially
became
a
man
in
his
responsible
situation
and
they
thought
that
pressure
could
be
put
upon
him
through
his
colleagues
and
the
general
opinion
of
the
other
foreign
representatives
but
in
this
expectation
they
were
disappointed
at
the
meeting
colonel
neale
altogether
declined
to
authorise
the
adoption
of
measures
which
if
the
tycoon
government
were
to
be
regarded
as
the
government
of
the
country
would
have
amounted
virtually
to
making
war
upon
japan
and
the
french
minister
expressed
an
opinion
entirely
coinciding
with
that
of
his
colleague
calmer
counsels
prevailed
and
diplomacy
was
left
to
its
own
resources
arrangements
however
being
made
by
the
naval
to
patrol
the
settlement
during
the
night
and
to
station
along
the
to
communicate
with
the
ships
in
case
of
an
alarm
looking
back
now
after
the
lapse
of
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
i
am
strongly
disposed
to
the
belief
that
colonel
neale
took
the
best
course
the
plan
of
the
mercantile
community
was
bold
attractive
and
almost
romantic
it
would
probably
have
been
successful
for
the
moment
in
spite
of
the
bravery
of
the
satsuma
but
such
an
event
as
the
capture
of
a
leading
japanese
nobleman
by
foreign
sailors
in
the
dominions
of
the
tycoon
would
have
been
a
patent
demonstration
of
his
incapacity
to
defend
the
nation
against
the
outer
barbarian
and
would
have
precipitated
his
downfall
long
before
it
actually
took
place
and
before
there
was
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
league
among
the
clans
ready
to
establish
a
new
government
in
all
probability
the
country
would
have
become
a
prey
to
ruinous
anarchy
and
collisions
with
foreign
powers
would
have
been
frequent
and
serious
probably
the
slaughter
of
the
foreign
community
at
nagasaki
would
have
been
the
immediate
answer
to
the
blow
struck
at
hodogaya
a
joint
expedition
would
have
been
sent
out
by
england
france
and
holland
to
fight
many
a
bloody
battle
and
perhaps
dismember
the
realm
of
the
mikados
in
the
meantime
the
commerce
for
whose
sake
we
had
come
to
japan
would
have
been
killed
and
how
many
lives
of
europeans
and
japanese
would
have
been
sacrificed
in
return
for
that
of
shimadzu
saburô
i
was
standing
outside
the
hotel
that
afternoon
and
on
seeing
the
bustle
of
men
riding
past
inquired
what
was
the
cause
the
reply
a
couple
of
englishmen
have
been
cut
down
in
kanagawa
did
not
shock
me
in
the
least
the
accounts
of
such
occurrences
that
had
appeared
in
the
english
press
and
the
recent
attack
on
the
legation
of
which
i
had
heard
on
my
way
from
peking
had
prepared
me
to
look
on
the
murder
of
a
foreigner
as
an
ordinary
affair
and
the
horror
of
bleeding
wounds
was
not
sufficiently
familiar
to
me
to
excite
the
feelings
of
indignation
that
seemed
to
animate
every
one
else
i
was
secretly
ashamed
of
my
want
of
sympathy
and
yet
if
it
had
been
otherwise
such
a
sudden
introduction
to
the
danger
of
a
horrid
death
might
have
rendered
me
quite
unfit
for
the
career
i
had
adopted
this
habit
of
looking
upon
assassination
as
part
of
the
day
work
enabled
me
later
on
to
face
with
equanimity
what
most
men
whose
sensations
had
not
been
deadened
by
a
moral
anæsthetic
would
perhaps
have
considered
serious
dangers
and
while
everyone
in
my
immediate
surroundings
was
in
a
state
of
excitement
defending
vyse
or
abusing
colonel
neale
i
quietly
settled
down
to
my
studies
in
those
days
the
helps
to
the
acquisition
of
the
japanese
language
were
very
few
a
thin
pamphlet
by
the
rev
liggins
containing
a
few
phrases
in
the
nagasaki
dialect
a
vocabulary
compiled
by
wm
medhurst
senior
and
published
at
batavia
many
years
before
rodriguez
by
landresse
a
grammar
by
mm
donker
curtius
and
hoffmann
in
dutch
and
a
french
translation
of
it
by
léon
pagès
a
translation
by
the
latter
of
part
of
the
dictionary
of
hoffmann
dialogues
in
japanese
dutch
and
english
à
la
langue
were
about
all
and
but
few
of
these
were
procurable
in
japan
i
had
left
london
without
any
books
on
the
language
luckily
for
me
dr
brown
was
just
then
printing
his
and
generously
allowed
me
to
have
the
first
few
sheets
as
they
came
over
at
intervals
from
the
printing
office
in
shanghai
a
japanese
reprint
of
medhurst
vocabulary
which
could
be
bought
in
a
japanese
bookshop
that
stood
at
the
corner
of
and
honchô
itchôme
speedily
proved
useless
but
i
had
a
slight
acquaintance
with
the
chinese
written
characters
and
was
the
fortunate
possessor
of
medhurst
dictionary
by
whose
help
i
could
manage
to
come
at
the
meaning
of
a
japanese
word
if
i
got
it
written
down
it
was
very
uphill
work
at
first
for
i
had
no
teacher
and
living
in
a
single
room
at
the
hotel
abutting
too
on
the
bowling
alley
could
not
secure
quiet
the
colonel
ordered
us
robertson
and
myself
to
attend
every
day
at
the
office
we
did
not
call
it
the
chancery
then
to
ask
if
our
services
were
required
and
what
work
we
had
consisted
chiefly
of
copying
despatches
and
interminable
accounts
my
handwriting
was
unfortunately
for
me
considered
to
be
rather
better
than
the
average
and
i
began
to
foresee
that
a
larger
share
of
clerical
work
would
be
given
to
me
than
i
liked
my
theory
of
the
duty
of
a
was
then
and
still
is
to
learn
the
language
first
of
all
i
considered
that
this
order
would
be
a
great
interruption
to
serious
work
if
he
insisted
upon
it
and
would
take
away
all
chances
of
our
learning
the
language
thoroughly
at
last
i
summoned
up
courage
to
protest
and
i
rather
think
my
friend
willis
encouraged
me
to
do
this
but
i
did
not
gain
anything
by
remonstrating
the
colonel
evidently
thought
i
was
frightfully
lazy
for
when
i
said
that
the
office
work
would
interfere
with
my
studies
he
replied
that
it
would
be
much
worse
for
both
to
be
neglected
than
for
one
to
be
hindered
at
first
there
was
some
idea
of
renting
a
house
for
robertson
and
myself
but
finally
the
colonel
decided
to
give
us
rooms
at
one
end
of
the
rambling
building
that
was
then
occupied
as
a
legation
it
stood
at
the
corner
of
the
bund
and
the
creek
where
the
grand
hotel
now
is
and
belonged
to
a
man
named
hoey
who
took
advantage
of
my
inexperience
and
the
love
of
books
he
had
discovered
to
be
one
of
my
weaknesses
to
sell
me
an
imperfect
copy
of
the
for
more
than
a
complete
one
would
have
cost
at
home
i
used
to
play
bowls
sometimes
with
albert
markham
of
arctic
fame
who
was
then
a
lieutenant
on
board
and
charles
wirgman
the
of
the
london
towards
the
end
of
october
we
induced
the
colonel
to
consent
to
our
getting
two
lessons
a
week
from
the
rev
brown
and
to
allow
us
to
engage
a
native
teacher
at
the
public
expense
so
we
had
to
get
a
second
and
pay
for
him
out
of
our
own
pockets
he
also
agreed
to
leave
us
the
mornings
free
for
study
up
to
one
a
teacher
it
must
be
understood
does
not
mean
a
man
who
can
teach
in
those
days
at
peking
and
in
japan
also
we
worked
with
natives
who
did
not
understand
a
word
of
english
and
the
process
by
which
one
made
out
the
meaning
of
a
sentence
was
closely
akin
to
that
which
poe
describes
in
the
for
the
decyphering
of
a
cryptograph
through
my
boy
who
was
equally
ignorant
of
english
i
got
hold
of
a
man
who
explained
that
he
had
once
been
a
doctor
and
having
nothing
to
do
at
the
moment
would
teach
me
japanese
without
any
pay
we
used
to
communicate
at
first
by
writing
down
chinese
characters
one
of
his
first
sentences
was
literally
prince
loves
men
i
also
venerate
the
prince
as
a
master
prince
as
i
afterwards
divined
being
merely
a
polite
way
of
saying
he
said
he
had
lots
of
dollars
and
and
would
take
nothing
for
his
services
so
i
agreed
with
him
that
he
should
come
to
my
room
every
day
from
ten
to
one
however
he
never
presented
himself
again
after
the
first
interview

sir

my
boy
turned
out
to
be
what
i
considered
a
great
villain
i
had
at
an
early
date
wanted
one
of
the
native
dictionaries
of
chinese
characters
with
the
japanese
equivalents
in
i
sent
him
out
to
buy
one
but
he
shortly
returned
and
said
that
there
were
none
in
the
place
and
he
must
go
over
to
kanagawa
where
he
would
be
sure
to
find
what
i
wanted
after
being
out
the
whole
day
he
brought
me
a
copy
which
he
said
was
the
only
one
to
be
found
and
for
which
he
charged
me
four
or
nearly
two
dollars
this
was
just
after
my
arrival
when
i
was
new
to
the
place
and
ignorant
of
prices
six
weeks
afterwards
being
in
the
bookseller
shop
i
asked
him
what
was
the
price
of
the
book
when
he
replied
that
he
had
asked
only
my
boy
had
taken
it
away
and
returned
next
day
to
say
that
i
had
refused
to
give
more
than
one
which
he
consequently
accepted
unconscionable
rascal
this
not
content
with
less
than
per
cent
of
a
squeeze
i
found
out
also
that
he
had
kept
back
a
large
slice
out
of
money
i
had
paid
to
a
carpenter
for
some
chairs
and
a
table
he
had
to
refund
his
illicit
gains
or
else
to
find
another
place
after
a
time
i
got
my
rooms
at
the
legation
and
was
able
to
study
to
my
heart
content
the
lessons
which
brown
gave
me
were
of
the
greatest
value
besides
hearing
us
repeat
the
sentences
out
of
his
book
of
and
explaining
the
grammar
he
also
read
with
us
part
of
the
first
sermon
in
the
collection
entitled
so
that
i
began
to
get
some
insight
into
the
construction
of
the
written
language
our
two
teachers
were
takaoka
kanamé
a
physician
from
wakayama
in
and
another
man
whose
name
i
forget
he
was
stupid
and
of
little
assistance
early
in
robertson
went
home
on
sick
leave
and
i
had
takaoka
kanamé
to
myself
in
those
days
the
correspondence
with
the
japanese
government
was
carried
on
by
means
of
dutch
the
only
european
tongue
of
which
anything
was
known
an
absurd
idea
existed
at
one
time
that
dutch
was
the
court
language
of
japan
nothing
was
farther
from
the
truth
it
was
studied
solely
by
a
corps
of
interpreters
attached
to
the
dutch
settlement
at
nagasaki
and
when
kanagawa
and
hakodaté
were
opened
to
foreign
trade
some
of
these
interpreters
were
transferred
to
those
ports
on
our
side
we
had
collected
with
some
difficulty
a
body
of
dutch
interpreters
they
included
three
englishmen
one
cape
dutchman
one
swiss
and
one
real
dutchman
from
holland
and
they
received
very
good
pay
of
course
it
was
my
ambition
to
learn
to
read
write
and
speak
japanese
and
so
to
displace
these
middlemen
so
takaoka
began
to
give
me
lessons
in
the
epistolary
style
he
used
to
write
a
short
letter
in
the
and
after
copying
it
out
in
square
character
explain
to
me
its
meaning
then
i
made
a
translation
and
put
it
away
for
a
few
days
meanwhile
i
exercised
myself
in
reading
now
one
and
now
the
other
copy
of
the
original
afterwards
i
took
out
my
translation
and
tried
to
put
it
back
into
japanese
from
memory
the
plan
is
one
recommended
by
roger
ascham
and
by
the
late
george
long
in
a
preface
to
his
edition
of
the
de
senectute
which
had
been
one
of
my
school
books
before
long
i
had
got
a
thorough
hold
of
a
certain
number
of
phrases
which
i
could
piece
together
in
the
form
of
a
letter
and
this
was
all
the
easier
as
the
epistolary
style
of
that
time
demanded
the
employment
of
a
vast
collection
of
merely
complimentary
phrases
i
also
took
writing
lessons
from
an
old
whom
i
engaged
to
come
to
me
at
fixed
hours
he
was
afflicted
with
a
watery
eye
and
nothing
but
a
firm
resolve
to
learn
would
ever
have
enabled
me
to
endure
the
constant
drip
from
the
diseased
orbit
which
fell
now
on
the
now
on
the
paper
i
was
writing
on
as
he
leant
over
it
to
correct
a
bad
stroke
now
on
the
table
there
are
innumerable
styles
of
caligraphy
in
japan
and
at
that
date
the
was
in
fashion
i
had
unluckily
taken
up
with
the
mercantile
form
of
this
several
years
afterwards
i
changed
to
a
teacher
who
wrote
a
very
beautiful
hand
but
still
it
was
after
the
revolution
of
the
which
is
more
picturesque
and
became
the
mode
and
i
put
myself
under
the
tuition
of
takasai
tanzan
who
was
the
teacher
of
several
nobles
and
one
of
the
half
dozen
best
in
tôkiô
but
owing
to
this
triple
change
of
style
and
also
perhaps
for
want
of
real
perseverance
i
never
came
to
have
a
good
handwriting
nor
to
be
able
to
write
like
a
japanese
nor
did
i
ever
acquire
the
power
of
composing
in
japanese
without
making
mistakes
though
i
had
almost
daily
practice
for
seven
or
eight
years
in
the
translation
of
official
documents
perhaps
that
kind
of
work
is
of
itself
not
calculated
to
ensure
correctness
as
the
attention
is
more
bent
on
giving
a
faithful
rendering
of
the
original
than
on
writing
good
japanese
i
shall
have
more
to
say
at
a
later
period
as
to
the
change
which
the
japanese
written
language
has
undergone
in
consequence
of
the
imitation
of
european
modes
of
expression
the
first
occasion
on
which
my
knowledge
of
the
epistolary
style
was
put
into
requisition
was
in
june
when
there
came
a
note
from
one
of
the
shogun
ministers
the
exact
wording
of
which
was
a
matter
of
importance
it
was
therefore
translated
three
times
once
from
the
dutch
by
eusden
by
siebold
with
the
aid
of
his
teacher
from
the
original
japanese
and
by
myself
i
shall
never
forget
the
sympathetic
joy
of
my
dear
willis
when
i
produced
mine
there
was
no
one
who
could
say
which
of
the
three
was
the
most
faithful
rendering
but
in
his
mind
and
my
own
there
was
of
course
no
doubt
i
think
i
had
sometime
previously
translated
a
private
letter
from
a
japanese
to
one
of
our
colleagues
who
had
left
yokohama
it
must
have
been
done
with
great
literalness
for
i
recollect
that
was
rendered
i
the
shabby
one
but
it
could
not
be
made
use
of
officially
to
testify
to
my
progress
in
the
language
after
the
richardson
affair
the
tycoon
government
erected
guardhouses
all
along
the
tôkaidô
within
treaty
limits
and
even
proposed
to
divert
the
trains
of
the
to
another
route
which
ran
through
the
town
of
atsugi
but
this
project
fell
through
foreigners
were
in
the
habit
of
using
it
for
their
excursions
but
robertson
and
i
had
to
pass
along
it
twice
a
week
on
our
way
to
and
from
our
japanese
lesson
at
brown
and
though
determined
not
to
show
the
white
feather
i
always
felt
in
passing
one
of
these
trains
that
my
life
was
in
peril
on
one
occasion
as
i
was
riding
on
the
tôkaidô
for
my
pleasure
i
met
a
tall
fellow
armed
with
the
usual
two
swords
who
made
a
step
towards
me
in
what
i
thought
was
a
threatening
manner
and
having
no
pistol
with
me
i
was
rather
alarmed
but
he
passed
on
content
probably
with
having
frightened
a
foreigner
that
is
the
only
instance
i
can
recollect
of
even
seeming
intention
on
the
part
of
a
to
do
me
harm
on
a
chance
meeting
in
the
street
and
the
general
belief
in
the
bloodthirsty
character
of
that
class
in
my
opinion
was
to
a
very
great
extent
without
foundation
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
whenever
a
japanese
made
up
his
mind
to
shed
the
blood
of
a
foreigner
he
took
care
to
do
his
business
pretty
effectually
my
first
experience
of
an
earthquake
was
on
the
november
of
this
year
it
was
said
by
the
foreign
residents
to
have
been
a
rather
severe
one
the
house
shook
considerably
as
if
some
very
heavy
person
were
walking
in
list
slippers
along
the
verandah
and
passages
it
lasted
several
seconds
dying
away
gradually
and
gave
me
a
slight
sensation
of
sickness
insomuch
that
i
was
beginning
to
fancy
that
a
shaking
which
lasted
so
long
must
arise
from
within
myself
i
believe
the
sensations
of
most
persons
on
experiencing
a
slight
shock
of
earthquake
for
the
first
time
are
very
similar
it
is
usually
held
that
familiarity
with
these
phenomena
does
not
breed
contempt
for
them
but
on
the
contrary
persons
who
have
resided
longest
in
japan
are
the
most
nervous
about
the
danger
and
there
is
a
reason
for
this
we
know
that
in
not
very
recent
times
extremely
violent
shocks
have
occurred
throwing
down
houses
splitting
the
earth
and
causing
death
to
thousands
of
people
in
a
few
moments
the
longer
the
interval
that
has
elapsed
since
the
last
the
sooner
may
its
be
looked
for
we
have
escaped
many
times
but
the
next
will
be
perhaps
our
last
so
we
feel
on
each
occasion
and
the
anticipation
of
harm
becomes
stronger
and
stronger
and
where
we
at
first
used
to
sit
calmly
through
a
somewhat
prolonged
vibration
the
wooden
joints
of
the
house
harshly
creaking
and
the
crockery
rattling
merrily
on
the
shelves
we
now
spring
from
our
chairs
and
rush
for
the
door
at
the
slightest
movement
my
experiences
in
japan
of
an
exciting
kind
were
pretty
numerous
but
i
regret
to
say
never
included
a
really
serious
earthquake
and
those
who
care
to
read
more
about
the
insignificant
specimens
that
the
country
produces
must
be
referred
to
the
pages
of
the
seismological
society
journal
and
other
publications
of
the
distinguished
geologist
my
friend
professor
john
milne
who
has
not
only
recorded
observations
on
a
large
number
of
natural
earthquakes
but
has
even
succeeded
in
producing
artificial
ones
so
closely
resembling
the
real
thing
as
almost
to
defy
detection
chapter
vi
official
visit
to

during
the
later
months
of
a
good
deal
of
correspondence
went
forward
about

of

whither
the
colonel
used
to
proceed
with
his
escort
and
the
larger
portion
of
the
legation
staff
some
went
by
a
gunboat
others
rode
up
to
the
capital
along
the
tôkaidô
at
that
period
and
for
several
years
after
the
privilege
of
visiting
yedo
was
by
treaty
restricted
to
the
foreign
diplomatic
representatives
and
foreigners
could
not
cross
the
rokugô
ferry
half
way
between
kanagawa
and
yedo
except
as
the
invited
guest
of
one
of
the
legations
and
now
all
the
foreign
ministers
had
transferred
their
residences
to
yokohama
in
consequence
of
the
danger
which
menaced
them
at
yedo
we
younger
members
therefore
appreciated
highly
our
opportunities
and
it
was
with
intense
delight
that
i
found
myself
ordered
to
accompany
the
chief
early
in
december
on
one
of
his
periodical
expeditions
thither
we
started
on
horseback
about
one
in
the
afternoon
in
solemn
procession
the
party
consisting
of
colonel
neale
a
von
siebold
russell
robertson
and
myself
with
lieutenant
applin
commanding
the
mounted
escort
it
was
a
miserably
cold
day
but
and
i
combated
the
temperature
by
dropping
behind
to
visit
brown
on
our
way
through
kanagawa
and
then
galloping
on
after
the
others
they
had
evidently
been
going
at
a
foot
pace
during
the
interval
at
kawasaki
we
encountered
an
obstruction
in
the
shape
of
an
obstinate
head
ferryman
who
did
not
recognize
the
british
chargé
and
refused
to
pass
us
over
the
men
on
guard
at
the
commanding
the
ferry
on
seeing
some
of
us
approach
to
demand
their
assistance
ran
away
the
colonel
fumed
with
wrath
but
fortunately
at
this
moment
there
arrived
in
breathless
haste
a
mounted
officer
from
kanagawa
who
had
followed
us
of
his
own
accord
on
hearing
that
the
english
chargé
had
passed
without
a
japanese
escort
so
the
ferryman
collected
his
men
and
we
got
over
without
further
trouble
a
couple
of
miles
beyond
the
river
we
came
to
the
gardens
called
the
where
we
were
waited
on
by
some
very
pretty
girls
everybody
who
travelled
along
the
tôkaidô
in
those
days
who
had
any
respect
for
himself
used
to
stop
here
in
season
or
out
of
season
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
smoke
a
pipe
and
chaff
the
fish
cooked
in
various
ways
and
warm
rice
beer
were
also
procurable
and
native
gentlemen
might
often
be
seen
folding
themselves
up
into
their
palanquins
after
a
mild
daylight
debauch
europeans
usually
brought
picnic
baskets
and
lunched
there
but
even
if
they
started
late
were
glad
of
any
excuse
for
turning
in
to
this
charmingly
picturesque
everyone
is
familiar
with
the
japanese
as
it
is
represented
in
the
myriad
works
of
art
of
these
ingenious
people
but
you
must
see
the
thing
itself
to
understand
what
a
joyful
surprise
it
is
to
enter
the
enclosure
crowded
with
the
oddly
angular
trees
utterly
leafless
but
covered
with
delicate
pink
or
white
blossoms
which
emit
a
faint
fragrance
and
cover
the
ground
with
the
snow
of
their
fallen
petals
it
is
early
in
february
that
they
are
in
their
glory
on
a
calm
day
when
the
sun
shines
with
its
usual
brilliance
at
that
season
while
in
every
shady
corner
you
may
find
the
ground
frozen
as
hard
as
a
stone
but
to
my
taste
the
looks
better
on
a
cloudy
day
against
a
dull
background
of
cryptomeria
when
you
sit
by
a
warm
fire
and
gaze
on
it
out
of
window
in
december
however
only
the
swelling
buds
are
to
be
seen
stretching
along
the
slender
shoots
of
last
spring
we
proceeded
on
our
way
without
any
special
incident
until
we
reached
the
notorious
suburb
of
shinagawa
half
consisting
of
houses
or
rather
palaces
of
where
a
drunken
fellow
who
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
shouted
at
us
got
a
fall
from
one
of
the
troopers
and
so
we
reached
the
legation
about
sunset
the
rest
of
the
staff
and
the
infantry
guard
who
had
come
by
sea
landed
about
an
hour
later
the
building
occupied
as
the
legation
was
part
of
a
buddhist
temple
behind
which
lay
a
large
cemetery
but
our
part
of
it
had
never
been
devoted
to
purposes
of
worship
every
large
temple
in
japan
has
attached
to
it
a
suite
of
what
we
might
call
state
apartments
which
are
used
only
on
ceremonial
occasions
once
or
twice
in
the
year
but
from
time
immemorial
it
has
been
the
custom
to
accommodate
foreign
embassies
in
these
buildings
a
suitable
residence
for
a
foreign
representative
could
not
otherwise
have
been
found
in
yedo
as
a
general
rule
every
japanese
with
the
exception
of
the
working
classes
lives
in
his
own
house
instead
of
renting
it
as
do
most
residents
in
an
european
capital
the
only
purely
secular
buildings
large
enough
to
lodge
the
british
minister
and
his
staff
were
the
or
hotels
of
but
the
idea
of
expropriating
one
of
these
nobles
in
order
to
accommodate
a
foreign
official
was
probably
never
mooted
there
remained
therefore
only
the
state
apartments
of
some
large
monastery
as
a
temporary
residence
until
a
site
could
be
obtained
and
the
necessary
buildings
constructed
consequently
there
was
no
ground
for
the
reproach
which
one
writer
at
least
has
urged
against
the
foreign
ministers
that
by
turning
sacred
edifices
into
they
had
insulted
the
religious
feelings
of
the
japanese
people
in
the
early
years
of
our
intercourse
with
japan
it
is
true
that
we
were
regarded
as
unwelcome
intruders
but
in
native
opinion
we
polluted
the
temples
by
our
presence
no
more
than
we
should
have
polluted
any
other
residence
that
might
have
been
assigned
to
us
lay
in
the
suburb
of
takanawa
fronting
the
seashore
and
was
therefore
conveniently
situated
for
communication
with
our
ships
the
smallest
of
which
could
anchor
just
inside
the
forts
at
a
distance
of
perhaps
a
mile
and
a
half
owing
however
to
the
shallowness
of
the
bay
boats
were
unable
to
get
up
to
the
landing
place
at
low
tide
and
the
assistance
which
could
have
been
rendered
by
a
gunboat
in
the
event
of
a
sudden
attack
such
as
had
been
experienced
in
was
absolutely
there
remained
however
the
comfort
derived
from
knowing
that
a
refuge
lay
at
no
great
distance
and
no
doubt
the
appearance
of
a
gunboat
within
the
line
of
forts
that
had
been
built
to
keep
out
foreign
fleets
produced
a
considerable
moral
effect
upon
the
general
population
though
desperadoes
of
the
sort
that
assaulted
the
guard
in
july
would
certainly
have
been
no
whit
deterred
by
any
number
of
threatening
which
could
not
reach
them
behind
the
house
there
was
a
small
ornamental
garden
with
an
artificial
pond
for
gold
fish
on
the
opposite
side
of
which
rose
a
hill
covered
with
a
good
way
off
from
the
quarters
of
the
minister
and
at
the
back
of
the
cemetery
belonging
to
the
temple
there
was
a
small
house
named
which
was
occupied
by
the
senior
chancery
assistant
a
tall
bamboo
fence
cut
us
off
entirely
from
this
part
of
the
grounds
and
joined
the
house
at
either
end
the
rooms
were
not
spacious
and
very
little
attempt
had
been
made
to
convert
them
into
comfortable
apartments
i
think
there
was
an
iron
stove
or
two
in
the
principal
rooms
but
elsewhere
the
only
means
of
warming
was
a
japanese
brasier
piled
up
with
red
hot
charcoal
the
exhalations
from
which
were
very
disagreeable
to
a
novice
the
native
who
wraps
himself
up
in
thick
wadded
clothes
and
squats
on
the
floor
has
no
difficulty
in
keeping
himself
warm
with
the
aid
of
this
arrangement
over
which
he
holds
the
tips
of
his
fingers
his
legs
being
crumpled
up
under
him
the
superficies
he
presents
to
the
cold
air
is
much
less
than
it
would
be
if
he
sat
in
a
chair
with
outstretched
limbs
in
european
fashion
to
protect
himself
against
draughts
he
has
a
screen
standing
behind
him
and
squats
on
a
warm
cushion
stuffed
with
silk
wool
these
arrangements
enable
him
even
in
winter
to
sit
with
the
window
open
so
long
as
it
has
a
southern
aspect
and
foreigners
who
adopt
the
same
system
have
made
shift
to
get
on
but
if
you
are
going
to
live
in
japan
in
european
style
you
must
in
order
to
be
moderately
warm
during
the
winter
months
replace
the
paper
of
the
outer
wooden
slides
with
glass
stop
up
the
openwork
above
the
grooves
in
which
the
slides
work
that
divide
the
rooms
and
either
build
a
fireplace
or
put
up
an
american
stove
but
even
all
this
will
not
make
you
thoroughly
comfortable
underneath
you
there
are
thick
straw
mats
laid
upon
thin
and
badly
jointed
boarding
through
which
the
cutting
wind
rises
all
over
the
floor
while
the
keen
draughts
pierce
through
between
the
uprights
and
the
shrunken
walls
the
unsuitability
of
such
a
building
as
a
residence
for
the
minister
and
his
staff
had
been
perceived
from
the
outset
and
long
negotiations
having
for
their
object
the
erection
of
a
permanent
legation
had
by
this
time
resulted
in
the
assignment
of
an
excellent
site
on
which
a
complete
series
of
buildings
was
being
constructed
from
english
designs
but
at
the
expense
of
the
shôgun
government
other
sites
in
the
immediate
vicinity
had
been
given
to
the
french
dutch
and
americans
for
the
same
purpose
all
these
were
carved
out
of
what
had
been
once
a
favourite
pleasure
resort
of
the
people
of
yedo
whither
in
the
spring
all
classes
flocked
to
picnic
under
the
blossoms
of
the
in
sight
of
the
blue
waters
of
the
bay
gotenyama
was
indeed
a
famous
spot
in
the
history
of
the
shôgunate
in
its
early
days
the
head
of
the
state
was
wont
to
go
forth
thither
to
meet
the
great
on
their
annual
entry
into
yedo
until
iyémitsu
the
third
of
the
line
to
mark
still
more
strongly
the
supremacy
to
which
he
felt
he
could
safely
lay
claim
resolved
that
henceforward
he
would
receive
them
in
his
castle
just
like
the
rest
of
his
vassals
from
that
time
the
gardens
had
been
dedicated
to
the
public
use
but
already
before
the
foreign
diplomats
took
up
their
abode
in
yedo
gotenyama
had
been
partially
diverted
from
its
original
purpose
and
vast
masses
of
earth
had
been
carried
off
to
form
part
of
the
line
of
forts
from
shinagawa
to
the
other
side
of
the
junk
channel
that
leads
into
the
river
the
british
minister
residence
a
large
house
which
from
a
distance
seemed
to
be
two
stood
on
an
eminence
fronting
the
sea
magnificent
timbers
had
been
employed
in
its
construction
and
the
rooms
were
of
palatial
dimensions
the
floors
were
lacquered
and
the
walls
covered
with
a
tastefully
designed
japanese
paper
behind
and
below
it
a
bungalow
had
been
erected
for
the
japanese
secretary
and
a
site
had
been
chosen
for
a
second
destined
for
the
assistants
and
students
on
the
southern
side
of
the
compound
was
an
immense
range
of
stables
containing
stalls
for
horses
and
on
the
second
storey
quarters
for
a
portion
of
the
european
guard
some
slight
progress
had
been
made
with
the
buildings
for
the
french
and
dutch
legations
but
we
knew
that
the
people
disliked
our
presence
there
the
official
and
military
class
objected
to
the
foreigner
being
permitted
to
occupy
such
a
commanding
position
overlooking
the
rear
of
the
forts
and
the
populace
resented
the
conversion
of
their
former
into
a
home
for
the
outer
barbarians
to
press
on
the
completion
of
the
houses
and
to
take
possession
was
rightly
considered
an
important
matter
of
policy
a
deep
trench
was
being
dug
round
the
enclosure
and
a
lofty
wooden
palisade
was
built
on
the
inner
margin
which
it
was
expected
would
afford
sufficient
protection
against
a
repetition
of
such
attacks
as
that
of
the
july
and
the
british
ensign
was
to
be
hoisted
again
in
yedo
as
soon
as
the
buildings
should
be
ready
for
occupation
we
all
looked
forward
to
that
event
with
the
liveliest
feelings
of
anticipation
and
for
myself
i
anxiously
expected
its
arrival
because
yokohama
was
a
hybrid
sort
of
town
that
by
no
means
fulfilled
my
expectations
and
i
hoped
before
long
to
become
a
resident
of
the
famous
city
to
which
i
had
looked
with
longing
eyes
from
the
other
side
of
europe
we
rode
daily
in
the
environs
of
yedo
to
the
pretty
at
oji
which
is
depicted
with
such
bright
colours
in
laurence
oliphant
book
to
the
pond
of
on
the
road
to
to
the
other
pond
called
senzoku
half
way
to
mariko
and
to
the
temple
of
fudô
at
meguro
where
the
pretty
damsels
at
the
formed
more
than
half
the
attraction
within
the
city
we
made
excursions
to
the
temple
of
kwannon
at
asakusa
then
and
for
long
afterwards
the
principal
sight
of
interest
to
the
foreign
visitor
to
atagoyama
where
other
pretty
damsels
served
a
decoction
of
salted
and
to
the
temple
of
kanda
miôjin
for
the
view
over
the
city
but
the
gorgeous
mausoleums
of
the
shôguns
at
shiba
and
uyeno
were
closed
to
the
foreigner
and
remained
so
up
to
the
revolution
of
we
were
allowed
in
riding
back
from
asakusa
to
catch
a
passing
glimpse
of
the
lotus
pond
which
is
now
surrounded
by
a
racecourse
after
the
european
manner
but
the
fukiagé
park
since
known
as
the
mikado
garden
and
the
short
cut
through
the
castle
from
the
sakurada
gate
to
the
wadagura
gate
of
the
inner
circle
were
shut
to
us
in
common
with
the
japanese
public
a
large
portion
of
the
city
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
castle
and
large
areas
in
every
quarter
were
occupied
by
the
of
and
of
which
little
could
be
seen
but
long
rows
of
stern
surrounding
the
residence
of
the
owner
from
the
top
of
atagoyama
alone
was
it
possible
to
get
a
view
of
the
interior
of
such
enclosures
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
knowledge
thus
gained
completely
upset
the
idea
that
the
nobles
lived
in
palaces
irregular
masses
of
low
brown
roofs
and
black
walls
alone
were
visible
the
use
of
telescopes
was
strictly
forbidden
on
atagoyama
lest
the
people
should
pry
into
the
domestic
doings
of
their
masters
wherever
we
went
a
band
of
mounted
guards
surrounded
us
ostensibly
for
our
protection
but
also
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
free
communication
with
the
people
these
men
belonged
to
a
force
raised
by
the
shôgun
ministers
from
the
younger
sons
of
the
and
numbered
or
they
wore
the
customary
pair
of
swords
a
long
and
short
sabre
thrust
through
the
belt
on
the
left
side
a
round
flat
hat
woven
from
the
tendrils
of
the
wistaria
for
the
rank
and
file
and
a
lacquered
wooden
hat
for
the
officers
a
mantle
or
and
the
wide
trousers
called
between
them
and
the
members
of
the
foreign
legations
there
existed
no
tie
of
any
kind
for
they
were
changed
every
fifteen
days
just
like
so
many
policemen
and
mounted
guard
indifferently
at
all
the
legations
it
was
not
until
that
i
managed
to
break
through
this
rule
and
get
a
special
body
of
men
attached
to
myself
small
guardhouses
were
dotted
about
the
legation
grounds
for
their
accommodation
as
soon
as
it
became
known
that
a
foreigner
was
about
to
go
out
on
foot
or
on
horseback
were
detailed
to
follow
him
at
all
hazards
it
was
impossible
to
escape
their
vigilance
they
were
to
prevent
our
speaking
to
any
person
above
the
rank
of
a
common
citizen
or
to
enter
a
private
house
on
one
occasion
two
members
of
our
legation
managed
a
visit
to
the
father
of
a
young
named
kotarô
who
lived
with
us
to
study
english
the
fact
was
reported
and
when
the
visitors
went
a
second
time
they
found
the
occupants
of
the
house
had
removed
to
another
part
of
the
city
we
were
allowed
to
sit
down
in
shops
and
even
to
bargain
for
articles
that
took
our
fancy
but
two
kind
of
purchases
were
strictly
prohibited
maps
and
the
official
list
of
and
government
officials
anything
we
bought
had
to
be
sent
afterwards
to
the
legation
and
delivered
to
the
officials
of
the
foreign
department
who
lived
within
our
gates
and
payment
was
made
to
them
on
one
occasion
the
prussian
representative
herr
max
von
brandt
made
a
determined
stand
against
this
prohibition
entering
the
shop
of
the
bookseller
in
shimmei
maye
where
we
foreigners
were
in
the
habit
of
buying
books
he
inquired
for
the
list
of
daimiôs
the
bookseller
replied
that
he
had
it
not
in
stock
herr
von
brandt
knew
that
he
had
and
announced
his
intention
of
remaining
there
until
he
was
furnished
with
what
he
required
he
sent
a
member
of
his
party
home
to
the
legation
to
bring
out
the
materials
for
luncheon
and
sat
determinedly
down
in
the
shop
the
guards
were
at
their
wits
end
at
last
they
dispatched
a
messenger
to
the
castle
to
represent
the
impossibility
of
inducing
him
to
give
way
and
at
last
towards
evening
there
came
an
order
to
say
that
for
this
once
the
foreigner
was
to
have
the
book
so
the
day
was
won
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
it
was
never
necessary
to
proceed
to
this
extremity
as
we
could
easily
procure
what
we
wanted
in
the
way
of
maps
and
printed
books
through
our
japanese
teachers
mss
were
always
a
difficulty
as
nothing
could
be
published
without
permission
any
book
that
touched
upon
governmental
matters
had
from
of
old
to
be
circulated
in
amongst
such
works
were
the
hundred
laws
of
iyéyasu
which
were
supposed
to
embody
the
constitution
of
the
japanese
government
the
book
contains
references
to
offices
of
state
that
were
instituted
after
his
time
and
the
utmost
that
can
be
alleged
in
its
favour
is
that
it
perhaps
contains
a
few
maxims
from
his
lips
and
certain
rules
as
to
the
appointment
of
high
political
functionaries
that
were
observed
in
actual
practice
there
was
another
book
of
undoubted
authenticity
containing
a
vast
mass
of
administrative
regulations
of
which
i
never
obtained
a
copy
until
after
the
revolution
when
it
was
no
longer
of
practical
value
that
is
now
in
the
british
museum
another
expedient
for
eluding
the
censorate
was
printing
forbidden
books
with
moveable
types
it
was
frequently
resorted
to
during
the
last
years
of
the
shôgunate
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
rule
of
the
mikado
especially
for
narratives
of
political
events
during
that
period
and
for
one
or
two
important
treatises
on
politics
shimmei
maye
was
one
of
our
favourite
resorts
in
those
days
here
were
to
be
had
cheap
swords
porcelain
coloured
prints
and
novels
i
much
regret
that
i
did
not
then
begin
to
collect
when
the
blocks
were
comparatively
fresh
a
complete
set
of
hokusai
mangwa
in
perfect
condition
could
be
had
for
a
couple
of
dollars
and
his
hundred
views
of
fuji
for
about
a
couple
of
shillings
but
i
had
little
spare
cash
for
such
luxuries
and
all
my
money
went
in
necessaries
two
days
after
our
arrival
in
yedo
we
paid
a
visit
to
the
gorôjiû
or
shôgun
council
the
word
means
august
elders
it
was
somewhat
for
a
foreign
representative
to
use
the
prefix
in
speaking
of
them
but
the
phrase
had
been
caught
up
from
the
japanese
who
surrounded
the
minister
and
for
a
long
time
i
believe
it
was
thought
that
meant
five
i
unveiled
the
mistake
and
when
i
afterwards
became
interpreter
to
the
legation
we
adopted
the
practice
of
giving
them
the
bare
except
in
addressing
them
direct
when
etiquette
demanded
the
honorific
i
was
unprovided
with
anything
in
the
shape
of
uniform
and
had
to
borrow
a
forage
cap
from
applin
we
came
afterwards
to
look
with
much
contempt
on
these
gauds
and
to
speak
derisively
of
brass
caps
but
in
i
was
young
enough
to
take
considerable
pride
in
a
distinctive
mark
of
rank
and
after
this
occasion
lost
no
time
in
buying
a
bit
of
broad
gold
lace
to
wear
like
my
fellow
officers
it
was
an
imposing
procession
consisting
as
it
did
of
brass
caps
the
military
train
escort
of
twelve
men
under
their
gorgeous
lieutenant
and
a
flock
of
about
forty
japanese
guards
hovering
about
us
before
behind
and
on
either
flank
in
these
days
a
foreign
representative
may
often
be
detected
approaching
the
office
of
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
without
any
suite
and
in
the
humble
drawn
by
one
scantily
clad
coolie
the
interview
took
place
in
a
long
room
in
the
house
of
one
of
the
a
row
of
small
tables
extended
down
each
side
and
chairs
were
set
for
the
japanese
as
well
as
the
foreigners
on
each
table
stood
an
earthen
brasier
a
with
brass
and
and
two
long
pipes
with
a
supply
of
finely
cut
tobacco
in
a
neat
black
box
three
of
the
ministers
sat
on
the
right
side
of
the
room
and
with
them
an
whose
title
was
explained
to
me
to
mean
spy
i
suppose
censor
or
reporter
would
be
nearer
below
them
sat
eight
or
commissioners
for
foreign
affairs
we
used
to
call
them
governors
of
foreign
affairs
probably
because
the
governor
of
kanagawa
was
also
a
in
the
centre
of
the
room
sat
a
governor
on
a
stool
while
two
interpreters
one
of
whom
was
moriyama
takichirô
squatted
on
the
floor
the
four
higher
japanese
officers
alone
were
provided
with
tables
and
chairs
the
governors
sitting
on
square
stools
with
their
hands
in
the
plackets
of
their
trousers
after
some
complimentary
talk
about
the
weather
and
health
which
are
in
japan
a
double
row
of
attendants
in
light
blue
hempen
robes
we
used
to
term
the
upper
part
wings
came
in
bearing
aloft
black
lacquer
boxes
full
of
slices
of
sponge
cake
and
a
sweetened
bean
paste
and
afterwards
oranges
and
persimmons
then
tea
was
served
in
two
manners
simply
infused
and
also
the
powdered
leaf
mixed
up
with
hot
water
and
frothed
the
conversation
proceeded
at
a
very
slow
pace
as
it
had
to
be
transmitted
through
two
interpreters
ours
who
spoke
dutch
and
english
and
theirs
who
spoke
japanese
and
dutch
this
gave
rise
to
misunderstandings
and
the
japanese
ministers
seemed
every
now
and
then
to
profit
by
this
double
obstruction
to
answer
very
much
from
the
purpose
so
that
colonel
neale
observations
had
to
be
repeated
all
over
again
interpreted
and
often
the
ministers
would
seem
at
a
loss
whereupon
one
of
the
governors
would
leave
his
stool
and
glide
up
to
whisper
something
in
his
ear
this
proceeding
reminded
one
of
the
flappers
in
laputa
the
principal
topic
was
the
murder
of
the
sentry
and
corporal
at
which
has
already
been
related
to
all
the
demands
made
by
colonel
neale
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
he
had
received
from
lord
russell
the
objected
and
when
he
informed
them
that
the
british
government
required
the
payment
of
in
gold
as
an
indemnity
to
the
families
of
the
two
murdered
men
they
opened
their
eyes
very
wide
indeed
they
offered
colonel
neale
at
last
lost
all
patience
which
no
doubt
was
what
they
were
aiming
at
he
gave
them
a
piece
of
his
mind
in
pretty
strong
language
and
the
interview
came
to
an
end
after
i
suppose
a
sitting
of
about
three
hours
length
without
anything
having
been
settled
i
forget
whether
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
siebold
literally
translated
the
epithet
son
of
a
gun
by
no
the
adjective
that
preceded
it
he
did
not
attempt
to
translate
as
it
has
not
even
a
literal
equivalent
in
japanese
the
way
in
which
the
ministers
contradicted
themselves
from
time
to
time
was
something
wonderful
and
the
application
of
the
good
unmistakeable
word
for
him
who
says
the
thing
that
is
not
was
almost
venial
of
course
colonel
neale
did
not
omit
to
complain
of
the
ferryman
and
the
guards
at
kawasaki
who
had
run
away
instead
of
putting
us
over
the
river
and
eusden
in
translating
used
the
words
sloopen
alle
which
excited
my
risible
muscles
kept
at
too
great
a
stretch
through
these
tedious
hours
i
whispered
to
my
neighbour
they
all
sloped
away
a
terrible
frown
from
the
old
gentleman
rebuked
my
indecorous
behaviour
and
i
was
afterwards
informed
that
i
should
never
be
allowed
thenceforth
to
be
present
on
one
of
these
solemn
occasions
that
was
a
relief
to
me
but
i
confess
i
ought
to
have
felt
more
contrite
than
i
did
at
the
age
of
nineteen
and
a
half
a
boy
is
still
a
boy
but
i
ought
to
have
manifested
more
respect
for
my
elders
early
in
february
we
received
news
that
the
legation
buildings
in
gotenyama
had
been
destroyed
by
fire
on
the
night
of
the
many
years
afterwards
i
learnt
on
the
best
possible
authority
that
the
incendiaries
were
chiefly
chôshiû
men
belonging
to
the
party
three
at
least
afterwards
rose
to
high
position
in
the
state
these
were
count
itô
minister
president
of
state
count
inouyé
kaoru
who
the
third
was
i
forget
it
need
scarcely
be
said
that
they
long
ago
abandoned
their
views
of
the
necessity
of
putting
an
end
to
the
intercourse
of
their
country
with
the
outside
world
and
they
are
now
the
leaders
of
the
movement
in
favour
of
the
introduction
into
japan
of
whatever
western
institutions
are
adapted
to
the
wants
and
wishes
of
the
people
willis
and
i
were
now
living
together
in
a
wing
of
the
legation
house
at
no
on
the
bund
and
a
young
japanese
named
kobayashi
kotarô
messed
with
us
he
had
been
placed
under
willis
charge
by
the
japanese
government
in
order
to
acquire
the
english
language
and
was
a
nice
boy
though
perhaps
not
endowed
with
more
than
average
abilities
he
disappeared
to
his
home
about
the
time
that
the
ultimatum
of
the
british
government
was
presented
to
the
council
of
the
tycoon
in
the
spring
of
and
we
never
heard
of
him
again
i
had
the
teacher
takaoka
kanamé
now
all
to
myself
and
was
beginning
to
read
japanese
documents
across
the
hills
south
of
the
settlement
lived
a
priest
who
knew
something
of
the
sanskrit
alphabet
as
used
in
japan
and
i
used
to
go
once
or
twice
a
week
to
him
for
instruction
but
these
studies
were
interrupted
by
the
rumours
of
war
that
began
soon
to
prevail
and
the
lessons
from
the
american
missionary
brown
also
came
to
an
end
as
i
was
now
able
to
get
on
alone
chapter
vii
demands
for
reparation
japanese
proposal
to
close
the
ports
payment
of
the
indemnity
a
very
complete
account
of
the
murder
of
richardson
and
the
failure
of
the
japanese
government
to
afford
satisfactory
redress
either
for
that
injury
or
for
the
attack
on
the
legation
in
june
had
been
sent
home
to
the
foreign
office
and
in
march
colonel
neale
received
instructions
to
demand
ample
reparation
from
both
the
tycoon
and
the
prince
of
satsuma
on
the
april
he
sent
eusden
up
to
yedo
on
board
the
gunboat
havoc
to
deliver
a
note
demanding
the
payment
of
in
gold
for
the
wives
and
families
of
sweet
and
crimp
an
ample
apology
for
the
other
affair
and
the
payment
of
as
a
penalty
on
the
tycoon
for
allowing
an
englishman
to
be
murdered
in
his
territory
in
open
daylight
without
making
any
effort
to
arrest
the
murderers
he
warned
the
council
that
refusal
would
be
attended
with
very
deplorable
consequences
to
their
country
and
gave
them
twenty
days
to
consider
their
reply
this
lengthened
period
was
allowed
on
account
of
the
absence
of
the
tycoon
and
his
chief
advisers
who
had
left
for
kiôto
on
the
if
at
the
conclusion
of
the
term
allotted
no
answer
was
returned
or
an
unsatisfactory
one
was
given
coercive
measures
would
immediately
be
taken
it
was
also
intended
that
on
the
return
of
the
havoc
from
yedo
the
pearl
should
be
despatched
to
kagoshima
to
demand
of
the
prince
of
satsuma
the
trial
and
execution
of
the
murderers
of
richardson
in
the
presence
of
one
or
more
english
officers
and
the
payment
of
to
be
distributed
to
the
relatives
of
richardson
to
marshall
clarke
and
mrs
borradaile
on
the
eusden
came
back
from
yedo
bringing
a
receipt
for
the
note
and
a
refusal
on
the
part
of
the
council
to
send
an
officer
down
to
kagoshima
to
advise
the
prince
of
satsuma
to
admit
the
demands
to
be
made
upon
him
so
the
idea
of
despatching
the
pearl
was
abandoned
for
the
moment
as
it
was
impossible
to
foretell
whether
the
council
would
give
in
if
they
were
obstinate
reprisals
would
at
once
it
was
thought
be
commenced
and
all
our
available
force
would
be
required
to
coerce
the
tycoon
people
satsuma
must
be
left
to
be
dealt
with
afterwards
so
the
colonel
waited
until
the
by
the
april
we
had
in
the
harbour
the
euryalus
guns
bearing
the
flag
of
admiral
küper
the
pearl
guns
encounter
commanded
by
the
brave
roderick
dew
rattler
argus
centaur
and
gunboats
the
despatch
boats
racehorse
and
ringdove
were
employed
in
travelling
backwards
and
forwards
between
yokohama
and
shanghai
with
the
mails
and
the
coquette
was
daily
expected
from
hongkong
but
as
was
to
be
anticipated
the
council
begged
for
further
delay
they
asked
for
thirty
days
and
colonel
neale
gave
them
fifteen
my
teacher
takaoka
who
had
private
relations
with
the
of
the
prince
of
said
they
had
never
expected
to
get
more
than
a
fortnight
and
as
they
felt
certain
the
english
chargé
d
affaires
would
cut
down
their
demands
they
asked
for
double
he
believed
that
the
only
motive
for
the
delay
was
to
gain
time
for
preparation
and
that
war
was
certain
in
the
native
quarter
it
was
rumoured
that
the
english
had
asked
for
the
delay
which
had
been
graciously
granted
by
the
council
otherwise
we
should
have
been
attacked
the
very
day
after
the
term
elapsed
the
inhabitants
of
yedo
expected
war
and
began
to
remove
their
valuables
into
the
country
young
kotarô
had
been
carried
off
by
his
mama
about
the
at
uraga
the
little
just
outside
the
entrance
to
the
bay
of
yedo
there
was
a
panic
and
the
people
were
said
to
have
decamped
with
all
their
movable
property
to
hodogaya
on
the
tôkaidô
on
the
other
hand
there
was
some
alarm
felt
in
the
foreign
settlement
meetings
were
held
at
which
resolutions
were
passed
to
the
effect
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
executive
to
provide
for
the
safety
of
the
european
residents
at
the
same
time
the
merchants
declared
their
intention
of
not
leaving
the
settlement
unless
specially
called
on
to
do
so
by
colonel
neale
as
they
believed
that
if
they
deserted
their
property
without
such
an
order
they
would
not
be
able
to
recover
its
value
afterwards
in
the
event
of
its
being
destroyed
the
precedent
of
the
opium
surrendered
to
captain
elliot
the
british
superintendent
of
trade
at
canton
in
was
of
course
in
their
minds
and
they
acted
prudently
in
throwing
the
responsibility
on
the
authorities
on
the
may
the
council
asked
for
another
delay
of
fifteen
days
eusden
was
sent
up
to
yedo
with
a
message
to
the
council
that
before
the
colonel
could
grant
their
request
they
must
send
down
to
yokohama
one
of
their
number
to
receive
an
important
communication
which
he
had
to
make
to
them
the
native
population
now
began
to
be
seriously
alarmed
and
the
shopkeepers
of
kanagawa
removed
their
effects
to
hodogaya
so
as
to
be
out
of
reach
of
a
bombardment
and
to
secure
a
further
retreat
into
the
interior
if
necessary
by
the
paths
the
of
may
was
the
last
day
on
which
the
yokohama
people
were
permitted
by
the
native
authorities
to
send
away
their
property
to
yedo
the
government
circulated
a
sensible
proclamation
from
door
to
door
telling
them
not
to
be
alarmed
as
there
would
be
no
war
at
the
same
time
notice
was
served
on
the
peasants
within
two
miles
of
yokohama
to
be
prepared
to
give
up
their
houses
to
the
troops
but
as
yet
no
soldiers
had
appeared
on
the
scene
on
the
and
may
long
conferences
took
place
between
the
english
and
french
representatives
and
admirals
and
two
commissioners
for
foreign
affairs
takémoto
kai
no
kami
and
takémoto
hayato
no
shô
who
had
been
deputed
by
the
council
to
explain
the
reasons
why
a
further
delay
was
necessary
they
probably
represented
that
the
difficulty
in
acceding
to
the
english
demands
arose
from
the
opposition
of
the
for
it
seems
that
an
offer
was
made
to
them
that
the
english
and
french
forces
should
assist
the
tycoon
to
quell
the
resistance
of
the
party
in
order
to
enable
him
to
carry
out
the
promises
to
which
he
was
bound
by
treaty
they
offered
it
was
reported
to
pay
the
money
indemnity
disguising
it
under
the
ingenious
fiction
of
payment
for
a
ordered
in
england
and
wrecked
on
its
way
out
finally
an
extension
of
time
was
accorded
until
the
of
may
in
order
that
the
personal
consent
of
the
tycoon
who
was
expected
to
return
by
that
date
might
be
obtained
to
the
english
ultimatum
i
rode
out
to
hodogaya
on
the
afternoon
of
the
and
met
the
train
of
the
wife
of
a
going
westwards
but
saw
very
few
armed
men
other
than
those
who
accompanied
her
a
rumour
had
got
about
that
men
were
in
the
village
and
its
neighbourhood
but
the
report
was
obviously
without
foundation
during
the
night
of
the
may
there
was
a
general
exodus
of
all
the
native
servants
employed
in
the
foreign
settlement
many
of
them
took
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
spoil
the
egyptians
when
willis
and
i
rose
in
the
morning
and
called
for
boy
to
bring
breakfast
there
was
a
dead
silence
i
descended
to
the
pantry
and
found
it
empty
servants
and
cook
had
gone
off
carrying
with
them
a
revolver
a
japanese
sword
several
spoons
and
forks
which
they
doubtless
imagined
to
be
silver
and
the
remains
of
last
night
dinner
wrapped
in
a
this
theft
was
the
more
curious
as
i
had
the
day
before
entrusted
my
servant
with
a
considerable
sum
of
native
money
to
change
into
mexican
dollars
which
he
had
faithfully
delivered
to
me
but
we
ought
to
have
suspected
their
intentions
as
they
had
asked
for
an
advance
of
half
a
month
wages
and
had
contentedly
received
wages
up
to
date
takaoka
and
my
groom
were
faithful
so
was
also
the
messenger
who
went
off
into
fits
of
congratulation
on
learning
that
the
petty
of
which
i
had
charge
had
not
disappeared
it
is
much
to
the
credit
of
the
latter
class
that
they
have
often
stuck
by
their
masters
on
occasions
of
trouble
and
even
danger
when
every
one
else
has
deserted
the
foreigner
with
some
difficulty
we
procured
some
eggs
and
sponge
cake
and
i
went
off
to
the
customhouse
to
report
the
robbery
the
officials
of
course
promised
to
find
the
thieves
but
we
never
heard
anything
more
of
them
or
of
our
property
all
day
long
the
townspeople
continued
to
depart
at
a
great
rate
i
went
down
to
the
native
town
where
i
found
many
of
the
houses
shut
up
and
at
others
everything
ready
packed
for
removal
among
the
rest
my
friend
the
bookseller
at
the
corner
of
had
taken
to
his
heels
but
during
the
afternoon
a
proclamation
was
issued
by
the
customhouse
to
tell
the
people
that
there
would
be
no
fighting
and
many
of
them
returned
the
excitement
was
great
throughout
the
town
both
among
foreigners
and
natives
and
a
lamentable
instance
of
hastiness
occurred
on
the
part
of
a
frenchman
a
native
merchant
accompanied
by
two
others
went
to
ask
payment
of
a
small
debt
that
he
claimed
and
on
its
being
refused
tried
to
obtain
the
money
by
force
thereupon
the
frenchman
shot
him
and
two
others
including
the
also
fired
their
revolvers
four
bullets
passed
through
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
man
but
without
killing
him
the
french
admiral
was
excessively
angry
he
at
once
arrested
the
merchant
and
had
him
conveyed
on
board
the
flagship
two
americans
were
likewise
attacked
and
one
of
them
was
carried
off
halfway
across
the
swamp
by
eight
men
who
frightened
him
with
a
spear
and
an
iron
hook
which
they
held
over
his
head
he
was
rescued
by
the
tall
sergeant
of
our
legation
guard
or
else
he
would
probably
have
been
severely
beaten
if
not
killed
for
the
japanese
were
unable
to
distinguish
between
foreigners
of
different
nationalities
on
the
my
teacher
told
me
that
a
messenger
had
come
to
him
from
yedo
sent
by
a
personage
of
high
rank
who
desired
to
learn
confidentially
the
intentions
of
the
english
chargé
and
whether
he
was
disposed
to
await
the
return
of
the
tycoon
which
would
not
be
for
three
or
four
months
before
taking
hostile
measures
in
that
case
the
high
personage
who
was
superior
in
rank
to
the
council
would
agree
to
issue
a
proclamation
that
a
delay
of
a
thousand
days
had
been
agreed
upon
which
would
have
the
effect
of
restoring
tranquillity
at
yokohama
that
if
colonel
neale
getting
tired
of
these
repeated
delays
should
change
the
seat
of
the
negotiations
to
ozaka
the
high
personage
would
have
to
perform
which
he
rather
wished
to
avoid
as
a
penalty
for
failing
to
induce
the
foreigner
to
listen
to
his
representations
i
communicated
this
to
colonel
neale
and
the
reply
sent
was
that
he
could
not
consent
to
wait
so
long
as
three
months
the
council
had
announced
the
return
of
the
tycoon
for
the
may
and
colonel
neale
had
replied
that
under
the
circumstances
he
would
give
time
for
his
majesty
settling
down
again
at
home
but
on
the
a
note
was
received
from
them
stating
that
circumstances
had
arisen
which
prevented
their
fixing
any
date
whatever
for
his
arrival
at
yedo
this
seemed
to
point
to
an
indefinite
postponement
of
a
settlement
but
the
colonel
patience
was
not
even
yet
exhausted
this
accorded
with
what
my
teacher
had
told
me
the
high
personage
turned
out
to
be
the
prince
of
owari
takaoka
now
said
that
having
transmitted
colonel
answer
to
kiôto
he
would
no
longer
be
under
the
necessity
of
committing
suicide
as
he
had
been
able
to
show
that
he
was
not
responsible
for
the
foreigner
obstinacy
up
to
the
the
general
feeling
was
that
the
council
would
give
way
but
the
demand
for
a
further
postponement
of
the
japanese
answer
did
not
tend
to
encourage
the
hope
of
a
peaceful
settlement
a
japanese
friend
told
me
that
the
tycoon
could
not
by
any
means
accept
the
assistance
of
foreign
powers
against
the
and
that
the
abolition
of
the
mikado
dignity
was
impracticable
if
we
attacked
satsuma
the
tycoon
and
would
be
bound
to
make
common
cause
with
him
i
suppose
the
idea
of
the
foreign
diplomatic
representatives
at
that
time
was
to
support
the
tycoon
whose
claim
to
be
considered
the
sovereign
of
japan
had
already
been
called
in
question
by
rudolph
lindau
in
his
open
letter
of
against
the
party
consisting
of
the
mikado
and
and
if
necessary
to
convert
him
into
something
more
than
a
mere
feudal
ruler
for
we
had
as
yet
no
idea
of
the
immense
potency
that
lay
in
the
mere
name
of
the
sovereign
and
our
studies
in
japanese
history
had
not
yet
enabled
us
to
realize
the
truth
that
in
the
civil
wars
of
japan
the
victory
had
as
a
rule
rested
with
the
party
that
had
managed
to
obtain
possession
of
the
person
of
the
mikado
and
the
regalia
there
has
probably
never
been
any
sovereign
in
the
world
whose
title
has
rested
upon
so
secure
a
basis
as
that
of
the
ancient
emperors
of
japan
on
the
another
conference
took
place
between
the
english
and
french
diplomatic
and
naval
authorities
on
the
one
side
and
takémoto
kai
no
kami
and
a
new
man
named
shibata
sadatarô
on
the
other
the
latter
began
by
thanking
the
foreign
representatives
in
the
name
of
the
tycoon
for
their
offer
of
material
assistance
which
he
was
however
compelled
to
decline
as
he
must
endeavour
to
settle
the
differences
between
the
and
himself
by
his
own
unaided
forces
and
authority
as
to
the
indemnity
the
tycoon
government
recognized
that
the
demand
was
just
but
they
were
afraid
to
pay
immediately
as
their
yielding
would
bring
the
down
upon
them
but
they
offered
to
pay
the
money
by
instalments
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
attract
public
notice
and
the
further
discussion
of
the
details
was
put
off
to
a
future
occasion
probably
colonel
neale
did
not
care
very
much
how
the
matter
was
arranged
provided
he
could
show
to
her
majesty
government
that
he
had
carried
out
his
instructions
so
the
basis
of
an
understanding
was
arrived
at
and
it
was
further
conceded
that
the
foreign
representatives
that
is
those
of
england
and
france
should
take
measures
to
defend
yokohama
from
attack
by
the
party
colonel
neale
had
written
to
brown
who
was
in
command
at
shanghai
applying
for
a
force
of
two
thousand
men
but
a
despatch
now
arrived
from
the
general
stating
his
inability
and
objections
to
furnishing
any
troops
it
was
said
that
he
had
ridiculed
the
idea
of
a
military
expedition
against
japan
long
before
colonel
neale
proposed
it
to
him
nevertheless
the
establishment
of
a
garrison
of
english
troops
at
yokohama
was
merely
delayed
by
this
refusal
and
after
sir
rutherford
alcock
return
to
japan
in
the
spring
of
good
reasons
were
given
to
the
same
general
why
he
should
change
his
mind
all
this
time
there
existed
considerable
alarm
with
respect
to
the
aims
and
intentions
of
a
somewhat
mysterious
class
of
japanese
called
these
were
men
of
the
class
who
had
thrown
up
the
service
of
their
and
plunged
into
the
political
agitations
of
the
time
which
had
a
object
firstly
to
restore
the
mikado
to
his
ancient
position
or
rather
to
pull
down
the
tycoon
to
the
same
level
as
the
great
and
secondly
the
expulsion
of
the
barbarians
from
the
sacred
soil
of
japan
they
came
principally
from
the
south
and
west
of
the
country
but
there
were
many
from
mito
in
the
east
and
a
sprinkling
from
all
the
other
clans
about
the
end
of
may
there
was
a
rumour
that
they
designed
to
attack
kanagawa
and
the
americans
still
living
there
were
compelled
to
transfer
their
residence
to
yokohama
not
however
without
compensation
for
disturbance
the
tycoon
people
were
naturally
desirous
of
doing
all
that
was
practicable
to
conciliate
their
domestic
enemies
and
turned
such
rumours
to
account
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
confine
the
foreigners
at
yokohama
within
a
limited
space
such
as
had
formed
the
of
the
dutch
at
nagasaki
in
former
times
incidents
too
were
not
wanting
of
a
character
to
enforce
their
arguments
one
of
the
assistants
of
the
english
consulate
was
threatened
with
personal
violence
by
a
couple
of
men
as
he
was
entering
a
on
the
hill
at
kanagawa
he
pulled
out
his
pistol
and
pointed
it
at
them
on
which
they
drew
back
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
he
ran
down
to
the
where
he
got
a
boat
and
so
returned
in
safety
to
yokohama
it
was
reported
that
the
officials
at
the
guardhouse
tried
to
prevent
the
boatmen
from
taking
him
across
the
bay
but
however
this
may
be
they
pacified
his
assailants
one
of
whom
had
his
sword
and
in
those
days
we
were
always
told
that
a
might
not
return
his
sword
to
the
scabbard
without
shedding
blood
so
that
the
affair
was
entitled
to
be
ranked
as
very
alarming
at
the
beginning
of
june
in
consequence
of
a
report
that
were
concealed
in
the
place
the
a
body
from
which
the
legation
guards
at
yedo
were
supplied
together
with
some
drilled
troops
came
down
to
yokohama
and
took
up
their
quarters
at
some
newly
erected
buildings
under
nogé
hill
and
from
that
date
until
long
after
the
revolution
of
we
had
constantly
a
native
garrison
i
recognized
among
the
former
several
men
with
whom
i
had
become
friends
during
the
visit
to
yedo
already
narrated
fresh
additions
were
made
to
the
british
squadron
in
the
shape
of
two
sloops
the
leopard
and
the
perseus
the
rumours
of
warlike
operations
had
died
away
and
it
was
given
out
that
the
intention
of
directly
enforcing
our
demands
on
satsuma
had
been
abandoned
as
the
tycoon
had
undertaken
to
see
to
that
part
of
the
business
and
it
was
believed
also
that
to
insist
upon
them
at
present
would
give
rise
to
a
civil
war
on
the
june
there
arrived
at
the
legation
in
yokohama
kikuchi
iyo
no
kami
and
shibata
sadatarô
commissioners
for
foreign
affairs
to
complete
arrangements
for
paying
representing
in
seven
instalments
extending
over
six
weeks
the
first
to
be
delivered
on
the
but
on
that
day
came
a
note
of
excuse
from
one
of
the
council
stating
that
unavoidable
circumstances
had
arisen
which
prevented
the
agreement
being
carried
out
and
that
he
himself
would
in
a
day
or
two
arrive
at
yokohama
to
discuss
matters
with
the
english
chargé
affaires
colonel
neale
very
properly
refused
to
hold
any
more
communications
with
the
tycoon
ministers
and
after
a
couple
of
consideration
finally
placed
the
solution
in
the
hands
of
admiral
küper
the
latter
it
was
said
did
not
know
what
to
do
he
had
never
seen
a
gun
fired
in
action
and
hardly
appreciated
the
suggestion
that
he
should
at
once
proceed
to
seize
the
steamers
lately
purchased
in
such
numbers
by
the
japanese
the
council
at
yedo
now
became
thoroughly
frightened
they
had
temporized
as
long
as
possible
and
had
worn
out
the
patience
of
the
english
authorities
but
they
left
no
stone
unturned
to
avoid
openly
giving
way
and
ogasawara
himself
came
down
to
yokohama
to
bring
the
french
chargé
and
admiral
to
intercede
the
latter
however
refused
insisted
on
the
demands
of
great
britain
being
satisfied
and
claimed
that
the
defence
of
yokohama
should
be
entrusted
to
them
ogasawara
had
just
returned
from
kiôto
with
an
order
from
the
tycoon
dictated
to
him
by
the
mikado
and
the
element
in
the
ancient
capital
to
make
arrangements
with
the
foreign
representatives
for
closing
all
the
ports
for
himself
he
seemed
to
dislike
his
instructions
and
even
gave
hints
to
the
french
chargé
as
to
the
nature
of
the
reply
which
had
best
be
given
a
pageful
of
notes
of
exclamation
would
not
be
sufficient
to
express
the
astonishment
of
the
foreign
public
of
yokohama
when
this
extraordinary
announcement
was
made
but
the
presence
of
the
combined
squadrons
in
the
harbour
relieved
them
from
any
anxiety
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
diplomatic
representatives
would
reply
to
it
the
japanese
government
having
completely
failed
to
persuade
the
french
authorities
to
intervene
on
their
behalf
which
would
have
indeed
been
impossible
when
the
request
was
accompanied
by
the
preposterous
demand
that
foreigners
should
forthwith
clear
out
of
yokohama
sent
a
message
to
colonel
neale
at
one
on
the
morning
of
the
june
to
say
that
the
money
should
be
paid
and
requesting
to
be
informed
at
what
hour
he
would
receive
it
the
reply
was
that
the
original
agreement
to
pay
in
instalments
having
been
broken
by
the
japanese
government
was
now
null
and
void
and
that
the
whole
must
be
delivered
in
the
course
of
the
day
this
was
accordingly
done
at
an
early
hour
carts
laden
with
boxes
containing
each
a
couple
of
thousand
dollars
began
to
arrive
at
the
legation
all
the
chinese
shroffs
men
employed
by
merchants
and
bankers
in
the
far
east
to
examine
coin
to
see
whether
it
is
genuine
were
borrowed
to
do
the
shroffing
and
counting
the
chancery
was
crowded
with
the
intelligent
chinamen
busily
employed
in
clinking
one
coin
against
another
and
putting
them
up
into
parcels
to
be
replaced
in
the
boxes
and
carried
off
on
board
the
squadron
the
process
occupied
three
days
but
already
on
the
colonel
neale
had
addressed
a
letter
to
the
admiral
relieving
him
of
the
unwelcome
task
of
undertaking
coercive
operations
illustration
payment
of
the
indemnity
for
the
murder
of
richardson
the
note
dated
on
the
very
day
on
which
the
indemnity
was
paid
in
which
ogasawara
dzusho
no
kami
to
give
him
his
full
title
had
conveyed
to
colonel
neale
the
orders
of
the
tycoon
to
close
the
ports
and
expel
all
foreigners
from
the
country
was
the
first
on
which
i
was
called
to
exercise
my
capacity
as
a
translator
of
course
i
had
to
get
the
help
of
my
teacher
to
read
it
but
my
previous
practice
in
the
epistolary
style
enabled
me
to
understand
the
construction
and
to
give
a
closer
version
perhaps
than
either
of
the
others
which
were
prepared
in
the
legation
this
to
me
supremely
important
document
ran
as
follows
i
communicate
with
you
by
a
despatch
the
orders
of
the
tycoon
received
from
kiôto
are
to
the
effect
that
the
ports
are
to
be
closed
and
the
foreigners
driven
out
because
the
people
of
the
country
do
not
desire
intercourse
with
foreign
countries
the
discussion
of
this
has
been
entirely
entrusted
to
me
by
his
majesty
i
therefore
send
you
this
communication
first
before
holding
a
conference
as
to
the
details
respectful
and
humble
communication
it
is
perhaps
a
little
too
literal
the
opening
phrase
is
simply
equivalent
to
the
monsieur
le
chargé
and
the
sentence
with
which
the
note
concludes
is
about
the
same
thing
as
the
assurance
of
high
consideration
which
we
have
borrowed
from
the
french
but
the
rest
of
it
is
accurate
and
the
allusion
to
the
mikado
which
appears
in
the
version
made
from
the
dutch
translation
furnished
by
the
japanese
the
bluebook
had
nothing
to
support
it
in
the
original
text
i
can
not
forbear
from
quoting
the
reply
of
colonel
neale
though
as
far
as
possible
i
intend
in
these
reminiscences
not
to
rely
on
published
sources
of
information
it
ran
thus
neale
to
the
japanese
minister
for
foreign
affairs
yokohama
june
the
undersigned
her
britannic
majesty
chargé
has
received
in
common
with
his
colleagues
and
with
extreme
amazement
the
extraordinary
announcement
which
under
instructions
from
the
tycoon
his
excellency
has
addressed
to
him
apart
from
the
audacious
nature
of
this
announcement
which
is
unaccompanied
by
any
explanations
whatever
the
undersigned
is
bound
to
believe
that
both
the
spiritual
and
temporal
sovereigns
of
this
country
are
totally
ignorant
of
the
disastrous
consequences
which
must
arise
to
japan
by
their
determinations
thus
conveyed
through
you
to
close
the
opened
ports
and
to
remove
therefrom
the
subjects
of
the
treaty
powers
for
himself
as
representative
of
her
britannic
majesty
the
undersigned
has
to
observe
in
the
first
instance
that
the
rulers
of
this
country
may
perhaps
still
have
it
in
their
power
to
modify
and
soften
the
severe
and
irresistible
measures
which
will
without
the
least
doubt
be
adopted
by
great
britain
most
effectually
to
maintain
and
enforce
its
treaty
obligations
with
this
country
and
more
than
this
to
place
them
on
a
far
more
satisfactory
and
solid
footing
than
heretofore
by
speedily
making
known
and
developing
any
rational
and
acceptable
plans
directed
to
this
end
which
may
be
at
present
concealed
by
his
majesty
the
tycoon
or
the
mikado
or
by
both
to
the
great
and
imminent
peril
of
japan
it
is
therefore
the
duty
of
the
undersigned
solemnly
to
warn
the
rulers
of
this
country
that
when
the
decision
of
her
government
consequent
upon
the
receipt
of
your
announcement
shall
have
in
due
course
been
taken
the
development
of
all
ulterior
determinations
now
kept
back
will
be
of
no
avail
the
undersigned
has
in
the
meantime
to
inform
your
excellency
with
a
view
that
you
may
bring
the
same
to
the
knowledge
of
his
majesty
the
tycoon
who
will
doubtless
make
the
same
known
to
the
mikado
that
the
indiscreet
communication
now
made
through
your
excellency
is
unparalleled
in
the
history
of
all
nations
civilized
or
uncivilized
that
it
is
in
fact
a
declaration
of
war
by
japan
itself
against
the
whole
of
the
treaty
powers
and
the
consequences
of
which
if
not
at
once
arrested
it
will
have
to
expiate
by
the
severest
and
most
merited
chastisement
with
respect
and
consideration
edwd
john
neale
with
the
exception
of
the
lapse
from
the
third
person
to
the
second
in
the
second
third
and
fourth
paragraphs
this
note
is
well
constructed
and
its
periods
nicely
balanced
the
language
is
perhaps
rather
stronger
than
more
modern
taste
would
approve
but
with
a
powerful
almost
overwhelming
squadron
of
at
one
back
the
temptation
to
express
one
feelings
with
frankness
is
not
easy
to
resist
what
the
writer
meant
by
rational
and
acceptable
means
directed
to
the
end
of
placing
the
treaty
obligations
of
great
britain
with
japan
on
a
more
satisfactory
and
solid
footing
than
heretofore
can
only
be
conjectured
i
think
it
is
an
allusion
to
the
plan
that
had
been
mooted
of
our
affording
material
assistance
to
the
tycoon
in
suppressing
the
opposition
of
the
of
the
west
and
south
to
the
policy
of
the
japanese
government
and
perhaps
to
a
formal
agreement
between
the
tycoon
and
the
mikado
that
the
latter
should
ratify
the
treaties
certainly
the
successful
execution
of
such
a
plan
would
have
placed
the
tycoon
firmly
in
the
seat
of
his
ancestors
and
have
forestalled
the
revolution
of
by
which
his
successor
was
upset
but
it
would
not
have
been
effected
without
enormous
bloodshed
and
the
japanese
people
would
have
hated
the
ruler
who
had
called
in
foreign
aid
to
strengthen
his
position
he
could
then
only
have
maintained
himself
there
by
the
adoption
of
the
severest
measures
of
repression
and
the
nation
would
have
been
subjected
to
a
terrible
and
lasting
despotism
it
is
certainly
a
thing
to
rejoice
at
that
the
tycoon
council
had
sufficient
patriotism
to
reject
such
an
offer
the
japanese
were
left
to
work
out
their
own
salvation
and
when
the
revolution
did
at
last
break
out
the
loss
of
life
and
property
was
restricted
within
narrow
limits
while
the
resulting
benefits
to
the
japanese
nation
in
the
establishment
of
civilized
and
comparatively
free
institutions
have
been
such
as
would
have
been
for
ever
precluded
had
the
suggestions
of
certain
europeans
been
listened
to
chapter
viii
bombardment
of
kagoshima
thus
one
portion
of
the
instructions
sent
out
from
home
had
been
carried
into
effect
and
there
now
remained
only
the
exaction
of
reparation
from
the
prince
of
satsuma
the
demands
to
be
made
included
it
will
be
remembered
the
trial
and
execution
in
the
presence
of
english
officers
of
the
murderers
of
richardson
and
the
payment
by
the
prince
of
an
indemnity
of
as
compensation
to
richardson
relatives
and
to
the
three
other
members
of
the
party
who
had
been
attacked
marshall
and
clarke
had
recovered
from
their
wounds
which
in
the
case
of
the
latter
were
serious
enough
as
he
had
received
a
dangerous
sword
cut
in
the
shoulder
and
mrs
borradaile
who
was
not
wounded
had
returned
to
china
the
tycoon
people
were
naturally
desirous
of
having
the
settlement
with
satsuma
left
in
their
hands
but
i
suppose
ogasawara
when
pressed
on
the
point
by
colonel
neale
acknowledged
that
the
government
were
impotent
in
the
matter
and
the
british
chargé
consequently
assumed
the
responsibility
of
requesting
the
admiral
to
convey
him
and
his
staff
to
kagoshima
in
order
to
present
the
demands
he
had
been
instructed
to
formulate
the
admiral
had
at
first
been
unwilling
to
send
more
than
a
couple
of
ships
but
it
was
finally
determined
that
the
squadron
should
consist
of
euryalus
pearl
perseus
argus
coquette
racehorse
and
the
gunboat
havoc
the
whole
staff
of
the
legation
from
colonel
neale
down
to
myself
embarked
on
board
the
various
ships
willis
and
myself
being
in
the
argus
commander
lewis
moore
the
weather
on
the
voyage
down
was
remarkably
fine
and
the
squadron
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
the
bay
of
kagoshima
where
it
anchored
for
the
night
on
the
afternoon
of
the
august
early
on
the
following
morning
we
proceeded
up
the
bay
and
came
to
an
anchor
off
the
town
a
letter
had
been
prepared
beforehand
stating
the
demands
which
had
somehow
or
other
been
translated
into
japanese
by
siebold
and
his
teacher
it
was
a
difficult
document
and
i
fancy
the
japanese
version
did
not
read
very
well
a
boat
at
once
came
off
from
the
shore
with
two
officers
to
whom
the
letter
was
delivered
in
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
some
other
officials
visited
the
flagship
and
stated
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
say
when
the
answer
would
be
given
the
name
of
the
principal
official
who
visited
colonel
neale
on
this
occasion
was
ijichi
shôji
i
knew
him
very
well
afterwards
in
yedo
he
and
his
retinue
of
forty
men
came
on
board
after
having
exchanged
a
parting
cup
of
with
their
prince
with
the
full
design
of
making
a
sudden
onslaught
upon
the
british
officers
and
killing
at
any
rate
the
principal
ones
among
them
they
intended
in
this
way
to
make
themselves
masters
of
the
flagship
it
was
a
bold
conception
and
might
have
been
successful
but
for
the
precautions
taken
on
our
side
only
two
or
three
were
admitted
into
the
admiral
cabin
while
the
marines
kept
a
vigilant
eye
upon
the
retinue
who
remained
on
the
quarter
deck
while
they
were
still
on
board
another
boat
arrived
whether
with
reinforcements
or
orders
to
countermand
the
intended
slaughter
i
do
not
know
but
ijichi
after
communicating
with
the
men
who
came
in
her
said
he
must
return
to
the
shore
in
the
evening
a
written
reply
was
received
the
bearer
of
which
was
told
to
return
on
the
following
morning
to
learn
whether
it
was
considered
of
a
satisfactory
character
the
letter
on
examination
proved
to
contain
a
de
non
it
said
that
the
murderers
could
not
be
found
blamed
the
tycoon
for
having
made
treaties
without
inserting
a
clause
to
prevent
foreigners
from
impeding
the
passage
of
the
prince
along
the
highroads
spoke
of
delay
until
the
criminals
could
be
arrested
captured
and
punished
after
which
the
question
of
an
indemnity
could
be
discussed
and
practically
referred
the
british
chargé
back
to
the
yedo
government
when
the
messenger
arrived
on
the
morning
of
the
he
was
informed
that
the
reply
was
considered
unsatisfactory
and
that
no
further
communication
would
be
held
with
the
japanese
except
under
a
flag
of
truce
the
admiral
then
made
a
little
trip
up
the
bay
to
reconnoitre
some
steamers
lying
at
anchor
off
wilmot
point
in
the
plan
and
take
some
soundings
at
the
head
of
the
bay
beyond
on
his
return
in
the
afternoon
the
commanders
of
the
various
ships
were
summoned
on
board
the
flagship
to
receive
their
instructions
from
the
admiral
there
was
no
intention
on
our
part
of
immediately
attacking
the
batteries
but
the
admiral
probably
supposed
that
by
adopting
reprisals
that
is
taking
possession
of
the
steamers
he
would
induce
the
satsuma
men
to
give
some
more
satisfactory
reply
than
that
already
received
in
pursuance
of
this
plan
captain
borlase
in
the
pearl
with
the
coquette
argus
and
racehorse
proceeded
to
seize
the
steamers
at
dawn
of
the
we
were
of
course
very
excited
and
busily
engaged
as
we
approached
in
estimating
the
probability
of
their
offering
resistance
but
as
the
argus
was
laid
alongside
the
sir
george
grey
we
saw
the
crew
rapidly
disappearing
over
the
other
side
into
shore
boats
with
which
they
had
already
provided
themselves
no
attempt
was
made
by
us
to
take
any
prisoners
but
two
remained
on
board
the
sir
george
grey
who
gave
their
names
to
me
as
godai
and
matsugi
kôwan
on
being
transferred
to
the
flagship
they
adopted
the
aliases
of
otani
and
kashiwa
the
former
was
a
remarkably
handsome
man
with
a
noble
countenance
and
was
i
believe
the
captain
of
the
steamer
the
profession
of
the
second
was
that
of
a
physician
he
had
been
to
europe
with
the
first
japanese
embassy
in
and
had
in
fact
only
just
returned
both
of
them
were
afterwards
well
known
the
first
as
a
rather
speculative
man
of
business
who
established
indigo
works
at
ozaka
with
capital
borrowed
from
the
mikado
government
the
second
was
for
a
short
time
prefect
of
yokohama
in
and
afterwards
minister
for
foreign
affairs
under
the
name
of
terashima
munénori
and
he
still
in
holds
office
at
tôkiô
we
returned
with
our
prizes
lashed
alongside
to
the
anchorage
under
the
island
of
sakura
jima
whither
the
squadron
had
removed
on
the
afternoon
of
the
in
order
to
be
out
of
range
of
the
guns
in
the
forts
before
the
town
the
euryalus
and
pearl
lying
about
mid
channel
between
us
and
the
forts
here
we
awaited
the
development
of
events
which
came
sooner
than
was
expected
the
japanese
made
no
sign
and
we
could
not
divine
their
intentions
from
the
slight
glimpses
obtainable
of
the
movements
on
shore
but
at
noon
the
report
of
a
gun
was
suddenly
heard
and
immediately
all
the
batteries
opened
fire
upon
the
squadron
although
it
was
raining
and
blowing
like
a
typhoon
the
admiral
at
once
gave
orders
to
engage
and
made
a
signal
to
us
and
the
racehorse
and
the
coquette
to
burn
the
prizes
on
this
we
all
rushed
on
board
our
prize
and
began
to
plunder
i
secured
a
japanese
matchlock
and
a
conical
black
but
some
of
the
officers
found
money
silver
and
gilt
the
sailors
seized
hold
of
everything
portable
such
as
looking
glasses
decanters
benches
and
even
old
pieces
of
matting
after
about
an
hour
of
this
disorder
the
steamer
was
scuttled
and
set
on
fire
and
we
went
to
take
up
our
order
in
the
line
of
battle
the
plan
shows
how
the
line
was
formed
some
time
elapsed
before
we
returned
the
fire
of
the
japanese
and
it
was
said
that
the
tardiness
of
the
flagship
in
replying
to
the
first
shot
of
the
japanese
two
hours
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
door
of
the
ammunition
magazine
was
obstructed
by
piles
of
boxes
of
dollars
the
money
paid
for
the
indemnity
being
still
on
board
the
perseus
which
was
lying
close
under
fort
no
had
to
slip
her
cable
and
the
anchor
was
months
afterwards
recovered
by
the
satsuma
people
and
returned
to
us
owing
to
this
delay
she
had
to
take
the
last
position
in
the
line
it
was
a
novel
sensation
to
be
exposed
to
cannon
shot
and
the
boisterous
weather
did
not
add
at
all
to
one
equanimity
the
whole
line
went
a
little
way
up
the
bay
and
then
curving
round
to
the
left
returned
along
the
northern
shore
at
a
distance
of
about
yards
each
vessel
as
she
passed
pouring
her
broadside
into
the
successive
forts
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
after
the
engagement
commenced
we
saw
the
flagship
hauling
off
and
next
the
pearl
which
had
rather
lagged
behind
swerved
out
of
the
line
the
cause
of
this
was
the
death
of
captain
josling
and
commander
wilmot
of
the
euryalus
from
a
roundshot
fired
from
fort
no
unwittingly
she
had
been
steered
between
the
fort
and
a
target
at
which
the
japanese
gunners
were
in
the
habit
of
practising
and
they
had
her
range
to
a
nicety
a
shell
exploded
on
her
about
the
same
time
killing
seven
men
and
wounding
an
officer
and
altogether
the
gallant
ship
had
got
into
a
hot
corner
under
the
fire
of
guns
at
once
from
down
to
pounders
the
racehorse
having
got
ashore
opposite
fort
no
the
coquette
and
argus
went
back
to
tow
her
off
which
we
succeeded
in
doing
after
about
an
hour
work
during
this
time
she
kept
up
a
constant
cannonade
and
the
gunners
in
the
fort
were
unable
to
do
her
any
mischief
but
at
one
moment
it
was
feared
that
she
would
have
to
be
abandoned
and
set
on
fire
i
shall
never
forget
the
interest
and
excitement
of
the
whole
affair
from
the
bursting
of
the
shells
high
in
the
air
against
the
grey
sky
all
round
the
flagship
as
she
lay
at
anchor
before
we
weighed
till
we
came
into
action
ourselves
and
could
see
first
the
belching
forth
of
flame
from
the
middle
of
a
puff
of
smoke
and
then
strange
to
say
a
round
black
thing
coming
straight
at
us
this
black
thing
however
suddenly
rose
high
into
the
air
just
as
it
seemed
about
to
strike
us
and
passed
overhead
the
argus
was
struck
only
three
times
first
in
the
starboard
gangway
then
by
a
shot
which
went
right
through
the
mainmast
but
left
it
standing
and
thirdly
by
a
round
shot
near
the
water
line
which
penetrated
about
three
inches
and
then
fell
off
into
the
sea
by
five
we
were
all
safely
anchored
again
under
josling
point
except
the
havoc
which
went
off
to
set
fire
to
five
loochooan
junks
that
were
lying
off
the
factories
probably
the
latter
were
set
on
fire
by
sparks
from
the
junks
but
credit
was
taken
for
their
wilful
destruction
under
the
impression
that
a
large
white
building
in
the
rear
of
the
town
was
the
prince
palace
every
effort
was
made
to
destroy
it
but
it
turned
out
afterwards
to
be
a
temple
and
we
learnt
that
during
the
engagement
the
prince
and
his
father
had
not
been
within
range
rockets
were
also
fired
with
the
object
of
burning
the
town
in
which
we
were
only
too
successful
the
gale
had
increased
to
such
a
height
that
all
efforts
on
the
part
of
the
townspeople
to
extinguish
the
flames
must
have
been
unavailing
it
was
an
awful
and
magnificent
sight
the
sky
all
filled
with
a
cloud
of
smoke
lit
up
from
below
by
the
pointed
masses
of
pale
fire
our
prize
was
still
burning
when
we
came
back
to
our
former
anchorage
and
as
she
had
tons
of
coal
on
board
she
made
a
good
bonfire
at
last
she
gave
a
lurch
and
went
to
the
bottom
it
was
no
doubt
a
great
disappointment
to
the
sailors
for
the
steamers
alone
were
worth
and
everyone
would
have
had
a
good
share
of
prize
money
if
we
had
been
able
to
carry
them
off
it
was
rumoured
that
the
prizes
were
burnt
at
colonel
neale
instance
who
was
very
anxious
like
the
old
warrior
that
he
was
that
every
ship
should
go
into
action
unhampered
it
was
also
said
that
poor
captain
josling
urged
the
admiral
against
his
better
judgment
to
fight
that
day
in
spite
of
the
adverse
weather
on
sunday
morning
the
august
the
bodies
of
captain
josling
commander
wilmot
and
of
the
nine
men
who
had
lost
their
lives
in
the
action
were
buried
in
the
sea
in
the
afternoon
the
squadron
weighed
anchor
and
proceeded
down
the
bay
at
slow
speed
shelling
the
batteries
and
town
at
long
range
until
we
left
them
too
far
behind
we
anchored
for
the
night
at
some
distance
from
the
town
and
on
the
proceeded
to
return
to
yokohama
most
of
us
on
board
the
argus
and
i
believe
the
feeling
was
the
same
on
board
the
other
ships
came
away
bitterly
discontented
the
japanese
guns
still
continued
firing
at
us
as
we
left
though
all
their
shot
fell
short
and
they
might
fairly
claim
that
though
we
had
dismounted
some
of
their
batteries
and
laid
the
town
in
ruins
they
had
forced
us
to
retreat
had
we
maintained
the
bombardment
until
every
gun
was
silenced
and
then
landed
or
even
lain
off
the
town
for
a
few
days
the
opinion
was
that
the
demands
would
have
been
acceded
to
rumour
said
that
colonel
neale
was
very
anxious
that
the
admiral
should
land
some
men
and
carry
off
a
few
guns
as
trophies
of
victory
but
that
he
declined
to
send
a
single
man
on
shore
and
men
said
that
he
was
demoralized
by
the
death
of
his
and
commander
with
whom
he
was
talking
on
the
bridge
when
the
shot
came
that
took
off
their
heads
but
none
of
this
appears
in
the
official
correspondence
i
believe
the
real
explanation
to
be
that
differences
had
arisen
between
the
diplomatist
and
the
sailor
the
former
of
whom
interfered
too
much
with
the
conduct
of
the
operations
no
doubt
the
etiquette
was
for
him
to
remain
silent
after
he
had
placed
matters
in
the
hands
of
the
admiral
but
this
the
impetuosity
of
his
nature
would
not
permit
him
to
do
it
is
also
possible
that
insufficiency
of
the
supply
of
coals
provisions
and
ammunition
may
have
been
a
factor
in
the
determination
that
was
come
to
the
admiral
in
his
report
which
was
published
in
the
london
gazette
took
credit
for
the
destruction
of
the
town
and
mr
bright
very
properly
called
attention
to
this
unnecessary
act
of
severity
in
the
house
of
commons
whereupon
he
wrote
again
or
colonel
neale
wrote
to
explain
that
the
conflagration
was
accidental
but
that
i
can
not
think
was
a
correct
representation
of
what
took
place
in
face
of
the
fact
that
the
perseus
continued
to
fire
rockets
into
the
town
after
the
engagement
with
the
batteries
was
at
an
end
and
it
is
also
inconsistent
with
the
air
of
satisfaction
which
marks
the
despatch
reporting
that
worth
of
property
had
been
destroyed
during
the
bombardment
illustration
kagosima
harbour
after
the
return
of
the
squadron
to
yokohama
we
settled
down
quietly
again
and
the
trade
went
on
pretty
much
as
usual
there
were
some
complaints
that
the
tycoon
council
were
laying
hands
on
all
the
raw
silk
destined
for
exportation
with
a
view
doubtless
of
forcing
up
the
price
and
so
recouping
themselves
out
of
foreign
pockets
for
the
indemnities
they
had
been
forced
to
pay
to
the
british
government
but
on
a
strong
protest
being
made
to
them
by
colonel
neale
the
embargo
was
removed
rumours
reached
us
of
disturbances
at
kiôto
where
the
retainers
of
chôshiû
had
been
plotting
to
take
possession
of
the
palace
and
seize
the
person
of
the
mikado
failing
in
their
plans
they
had
been
dismissed
from
their
share
in
guarding
the
palace
and
had
departed
to
their
native
province
taking
with
them
seven
court
nobles
who
had
been
mixed
up
in
the
plot
amongst
them
were
sanjô
sanéyoshi
and
sawa
who
afterwards
held
high
office
in
the
government
of
the
restoration
the
of
the
chôshiû
clan
which
had
been
one
of
the
foremost
in
demanding
the
expulsion
of
the
foreigners
was
a
turn
of
luck
for
the
tycoon
and
the
result
was
the
withdrawal
of
the
circular
of
ogasawara
proposing
the
closing
of
the
ports
ogasawara
himself
was
disgraced
foreigners
at
yokohama
began
to
breathe
freely
again
and
to
renew
their
former
excursions
in
the
neighbouring
country
but
on
the
october
a
fresh
outrage
completely
upset
our
tranquillity
a
french
officer
of
chasseurs
named
camus
while
taking
his
afternoon
ride
at
a
distance
of
not
more
than
two
or
three
miles
from
the
settlement
and
far
from
the
high
road
was
attacked
and
murdered
his
right
arm
was
found
at
a
little
distance
from
his
body
still
clutching
the
bridle
of
his
pony
there
was
a
cut
down
one
side
of
the
face
one
through
the
nose
a
third
across
the
chin
the
right
jugular
vein
was
severed
by
a
slash
in
the
throat
and
the
vertebral
column
was
completely
divided
the
left
arm
was
hanging
on
by
a
piece
of
skin
and
the
left
side
laid
open
to
the
heart
all
the
wounds
were
perfectly
clean
thus
showing
what
a
terrible
weapon
the
japanese
was
in
the
hands
of
a
skilful
swordsman
no
clue
to
the
identity
of
the
perpetrators
of
this
horrible
assassination
was
ever
discovered
but
it
made
a
profound
impression
upon
the
foreign
community
who
after
that
were
careful
not
to
ride
out
unarmed
or
in
parties
of
less
than
three
or
four
not
that
we
were
able
to
place
much
confidence
in
our
revolvers
for
it
was
pretty
certain
that
the
who
was
lying
in
wait
to
kill
a
foreigner
would
not
carry
out
his
purpose
unless
he
could
take
his
victim
at
a
disadvantage
and
cases
of
chance
encounters
with
peaceably
inclined
japanese
were
not
known
to
have
occurred
excepting
perhaps
the
richardson
affair
from
the
very
first
all
these
murders
were
premeditated
and
the
perpetrators
took
care
to
secure
their
own
safety
beforehand
it
was
an
agreeable
surprise
to
us
a
month
later
when
there
appeared
at
the
legation
two
high
officers
of
satsuma
who
undertook
to
pay
the
indemnity
of
and
gave
an
engagement
to
make
diligent
search
for
richardson
murderers
who
upon
their
arrest
were
to
be
punished
with
death
in
the
presence
of
british
officers
in
accordance
with
the
original
demand
we
may
give
colonel
neale
credit
for
knowing
that
there
was
no
genuine
intention
on
the
part
of
satsuma
to
carry
out
this
promise
but
on
the
other
hand
there
was
strong
reason
to
suppose
that
shimadzu
saburô
himself
had
actually
given
the
order
to
cut
down
the
foreigners
and
it
could
hardly
be
expected
that
the
satsuma
men
would
ever
consent
to
do
punishment
upon
him
the
actual
doers
of
the
deed
were
merely
subordinate
agents
we
could
not
with
justice
have
insisted
on
their
lives
being
taken
and
at
the
same
time
suffer
the
principal
culprit
to
go
in
order
to
succeed
therefore
in
enforcing
the
whole
of
the
demands
made
by
her
majesty
government
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
invade
satsuma
with
an
overwhelming
force
and
exterminate
the
greater
part
of
the
clan
before
we
could
get
at
their
chief
and
we
may
be
sure
that
he
would
never
have
fallen
alive
into
our
hands
we
had
bombarded
and
destroyed
the
greater
part
of
the
forts
and
town
probably
killed
a
good
many
persons
who
were
innocent
of
richardson
murder
and
had
thereby
elevated
what
was
in
the
beginning
a
crime
against
public
order
into
a
there
would
indeed
it
seems
to
me
have
been
no
justification
after
that
for
taking
more
lives
by
way
of
expiation
the
satsuma
envoys
however
formally
acknowledged
that
their
countrymen
had
been
in
the
wrong
and
they
paid
the
fine
demanded
by
the
british
government
no
one
therefore
can
blame
the
british
chargé
for
having
made
peace
on
these
terms
it
should
be
mentioned
however
that
the
satsuma
men
borrowed
the
money
from
the
tycoon
treasury
and
i
have
never
heard
that
it
was
repaid
chapter
ix
shimonoseki
preliminary
measures
sir
rutherford
alcock
returned
from
europe
early
in
march
and
colonel
neale
took
his
departure
the
members
of
the
legation
gave
him
a
farewell
dinner
at
which
he
delivered
himself
of
prognostications
as
to
the
future
of
those
who
had
served
under
him
for
me
he
prophesied
a
professorship
of
japanese
at
an
english
university
but
so
far
his
words
have
not
come
true
the
new
chief
was
liked
by
everyone
and
he
was
particularly
gracious
to
myself
relieving
me
from
all
chancery
work
so
that
i
could
devote
the
whole
of
my
time
to
my
japanese
studies
willis
and
i
occupied
a
wooden
house
in
a
back
street
between
the
native
town
and
the
foreign
settlement
and
there
i
worked
industriously
with
my
three
teachers
sir
rutherford
had
brought
with
him
very
ample
powers
which
he
determined
to
make
use
of
to
chastise
the
chôshiû
clan
for
its
hostile
attitude
we
had
it
might
be
said
conquered
the
goodwill
of
satsuma
and
a
similar
process
applied
to
the
other
principal
head
of
the
party
might
well
be
expected
to
produce
an
equally
wholesome
effect
in
the
summer
of
the
previous
year
the
chôshiû
people
acting
upon
the
orders
which
they
had
extorted
from
the
mikado
for
the
expulsion
of
the
barbarians
had
fired
upon
an
american
merchant
vessel
a
dutch
corvette
and
a
french
as
they
passed
through
the
straits
of
shimonoséki
the
corvette
had
returned
the
fire
and
in
the
other
two
cases
satisfaction
of
an
incomplete
kind
had
been
obtained
by
the
united
states
sloop
wyoming
and
the
french
squadron
under
admiral
jaurès
respectively
the
batteries
had
been
destroyed
but
as
soon
as
the
foreign
quitted
the
scene
the
chôshiû
men
set
to
work
to
rebuild
the
forts
to
construct
others
and
to
mount
all
the
guns
they
could
bring
together
so
the
hornet
nest
was
after
no
long
interval
in
good
repair
again
and
more
formidable
for
attack
and
defence
than
before
that
no
foreign
vessels
could
take
their
way
through
the
straits
of
shimonoséki
which
they
had
been
in
the
habit
of
passing
from
time
to
time
after
touching
at
nagasaki
in
order
to
make
a
pleasant
and
easy
passage
to
yokohama
instead
of
encountering
the
stormy
cape
chichakoff
was
felt
to
involve
a
diminution
of
western
prestige
nothing
but
the
complete
subjugation
of
this
warlike
clan
and
the
permanent
destruction
of
its
means
of
offence
would
suffice
to
convince
the
japanese
nation
that
we
were
determined
to
enforce
the
treaties
and
to
carry
on
our
trade
without
molestation
from
anybody
irrespective
of
internal
dissensions
sir
rutherford
alcock
therefore
lost
no
time
in
diligently
setting
to
work
in
order
to
bring
about
a
coalition
with
the
representatives
of
france
holland
and
the
united
states
in
this

completely
succeeded
the
tycoon
government
were
warned
that
if
they
did
not
within
twenty
days
give
a
satisfactory
undertaking
to
the
straits
the
foreign
squadrons
would
be
despatched
thither
to
bring
the
prince
of
chôshiû
to
reason
by
a
curious
coincidence
there
had
just
returned
to
japan
two
out
of
a
band
of
five
young
of
chôshiû
who
the
year
before
had
been
smuggled
away
to
england
to
see
the
world
and
learn
something
of
the
resources
of
foreign
powers
their
names
were
itô
shunsuké
and
inouyé
bunda
the
other
three
who
remained
in
england
while
their
companions
armed
with
the
new
knowledge
set
forth
on
their
journey
to
warn
their
fellow
clansmen
that
it
was
no
use
trying
to
run
their
heads
against
a
brick
wall
were
endo
kinsuké
inouyé
masaru
and
yamao
yôzo
they
made
themselves
and
the
object
of
their
return
known
to
sir
rutherford
who
promptly
seized
the
opportunity
thus
offered
of
entering
into
direct
communication
with
the
of
chôshiû
and
while
delivering
a
sort
of
ultimatum
of
affording
him
the
chance
of
abandoning
his
hostile
attitude
for
one
more
in
accordance
with
the
treaties
he
obtained
the
consent
of
his
colleagues
to
the
despatch
of
two
to
the
neighbourhood
of
shimonoséki
in
order
to
land
the
two
young
men
at
a
convenient
spot
and
delivered
to
them
a
long
memorandum
for
presentation
to
their
prince
a
french
officer
commandant
layrle
and
a
dutch
naval
officer
besides
major
wray
were
sent
at
the
same
time
to
gain
what
information
might
be
obtainable
as
to
the
present
condition
of
the
batteries
and
to
my
great
joy
i
was
lent
as
interpreter
along
with
my
colleague
enslie
on
the
july
we
left
in
the
corvette
barrosa
captain
dowell
and
the

vessel
cormorant
commander
buckle
and
passing
up
the
bungo
channel
anchored
off
himéshima
island
after
dark
on
the
we
ran
ashore
but
managed
to
get
off
again
smashing
the
of
the
cormorant
as
we
did
so
early
on
the
following
morning
we
landed
our
two
japanese
friends
itô
and
inouyé
who
at
that
time
went
by
the
name
of
shiji
after
promising
to
call
for
them
on
the
august
at
the
island
of
kasato
off
the
coast
of
suwô
on
the
way
down
i
had
talked
a
good
deal
with
them
and
between
us
with
the
aid
of
my
teacher
nakazawa
kensaku
a
retainer
of
ogasawara
who
had
to
seek
his
livelihood
in
consequence
of
his
master
disgrace
we
had
managed
to
put
sir
rutherford
memorandum
into
japanese
they
were
to
cross
over
in
an
open
boat
and
land
at
tonomi
in
suwô
at
eight
we
saw
them
leave
the
shore
in
nakazawa
opinion
the
chances
were
six
or
seven
out
of
ten
that
their
heads
would
be
cut
off
and
that
we
should
never
see
them
again
we
landed
later
on
in
the
day
at
himéshima
and
found
the
people
very
friendly
they
sold
to
us
a
plentiful
supply
of
fish
but
there
were
no
vegetables
beef
or
chickens
to
be
had
cattle
were
pretty
plentiful
and
fat
but
the
people
looked
poor
and
half
starved
the
population
was
about
the
island
was
not
fertile
i
tried
to
buy
some
beef
but
the
pretext
that
it
was
wanted
as
medicine
for
sick
sailors
a
japanese
idea
was
useless
half
the
population
was
engaged
in
and
banknotes
were
current
and
very
little
coin
was
to
be
seen
at
one
place
we
gave
a
man
an
worth
say
he
pretended
to
turn
it
over
and
look
at
it
carefully
and
then
said
these
are
very
rare
things
here
next
day
we
went
round
to
the
north
side
of
the
island
and
anchored
there
here
we
again
landed
to
visit
the
salt
pans
and
met
with
the
same
friendly
reception
as
before
on
the
we
crossed
in
one
of
the
ship
boats
to
imi
in
iyo
where
the
villagers
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
us
but
at
a
mile
or
two
further
west
they
made
no
difficulties
and
we
were
able
to
lay
in
a
supply
of
pumpkins
and
brinjalls
on
the
august
we
weighed
anchor
before
sunrise
and
stood
away
towards
the
straits
the
barrosa
anchored
about
ten
miles
on
this
side
of
shimonoséki
and
we
went
on
in
the
cormorant
steaming
towards
the
coast
of
buzen
and
then
up
to
isaki
point
when
across
the
mouth
of
the
straits
we
saw
signal
guns
fired
all
along
the
north
coast
from
chôfu
to
saho
after
going
nearly
up
to
tanoura
keeping
carefully
out
of
the
range
of
the
batteries
and
cruising
backwards
and
forwards
for
a
while
in
order
that
the
situation
of
the
batteries
and
the
number
of
guns
might
be
accurately
noted
we
finally
returned
to
himéshima
we
used
to
go
on
shore
there
for
a
walk
every
day
and
found
the
people
inquisitive
but
friendly
on
one
occasion
however
as
we
were
returning
through
the
village
to
our
boats
we
met
a
party
of
four
who
appeared
to
form
part
of
a
detachment
sent
over
from
kitsuki
in
buzen
to
protect
the
island
against
a
possible
attack
from
us
i
spoke
civilly
to
them
and
asked
where
they
had
come
from
but
they
answered
in
a
surly
manner
from
a
distance
they
looked
as
villainous
a
set
as
one
could
wish
to
see
and
remained
at
the
water
edge
watching
our
movements
until
we
got
on
board
on
the
august
we
made
another
trip
to
shimonoséki
in
the
cormorant
to
reconnoitre
going
in
a
little
further
than
before
in
the
direction
of
tanoura
on
this
occasion
in
addition
to
the
signal
guns
the
batteries
fired
a
round
shot
and
a
shell
as
a
warning
which
fell
in
the
sea
about
a
mile
ahead
when
we
got
back
to
the
barrosa
at
ten
in
the
evening
we
found
itô
and
shiji
had
already
returned
after
dinner
we
had
a
long
talk
and
received
the
prince
answer
they
brought
with
them
a
single
retainer
but
said
they
had
been
accompanied
down
to
the
coast
by
a
guard
of
soldiers
given
them
by
their
prince
they
commenced
the
delivery
of
the
communication
with
which
they
were
charged
by
saying
that
they
had
found
him
at
yamaguchi
and
had
handed
over
the
letters
of
the
four
foreign
representatives
to
him
in
person
he
had
then
consulted
with
his
chief
retainers
and
come
to
the
following
conclusion
that
he
entirely
acknowledged
the
truth
of
what
was
stated
in
the
letters
and
was
conscious
of
his
own
inability
to
cope
with
the
forces
of
western
nations
but
he
was
acting
under
orders
which
he
had
received
once
from
the
tycoon
and
oftener
from
the
mikado
and
not
on
his
own
responsibility
and
it
was
out
of
his
power
to
reply
to
the
foreign
representatives
without
first
receiving
permission
it
was
his
intention
therefore
to
proceed
to
kiôto
in
order
to
impress
his
own
views
on
the
mikado
which
he
calculated
would
take
about
three
months
he
begged
therefore
that
the
powers
would
postpone
operations
for
that
period
they
brought
no
written
documents
with
them
not
even
a
letter
to
certify
that
they
were
the
accredited
agents
of
their
prince
but
told
us
they
could
procure
one
if
the
vessels
were
delayed
for
two
or
three
days
they
were
informed
that
a
mere
verbal
reply
such
as
they
had
brought
could
not
be
expected
to
satisfy
the
foreign
representatives
they
then
inquired
whether
they
should
send
a
written
reply
to
yokohama
with
copies
of
the
orders
of
the
tycoon
and
mikado
but
captain
dowell
replied
that
their
prince
might
do
as
he
liked
about
that
his
instructions
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
enable
him
to
express
an
opinion
in
private
conversation
they
afterwards
told
me
that
their
prince
had
originally
been
favourable
to
foreigners
but
had
gone
too
far
now
in
the
opposite
direction
to
be
able
to
retract
and
they
did
not
believe
that
the
matters
at
issue
could
be
settled
without
fighting
they
suggested
that
it
would
be
a
good
measure
for
the
foreign
representatives
to
throw
over
the
tycoon
and
proceeding
to
ozaka
demand
an
interview
with
the
mikado
ministers
in
order
to
conclude
a
direct
treaty
with
him
they
spoke
with
great
bitterness
of
the
dynasty
accused
them
of
keeping
all
the
trade
both
foreign
and
native
in
their
own
hands
by
taking
possession
of
every
place
where
trade
was
likely
to
develope
such
as
nagasaki
and
niigata
and
they
said
these
feelings
were
shared
by
most
of
the
people
the
way
in
which
they
delivered
their
message
made
me
suspect
that
it
was
couched
in
far
more
uncompromising
terms
than
those
which
they
made
use
of
in
communicating
it
this
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
i
had
been
in
full
and
frank
communication
with
men
belonging
to
the
party
their
proposal
that
we
should
at
once
try
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
the
mikado
was
a
bold
one
and
calculated
if
it
had
been
adopted
rather
to
injure
than
help
their
cause
the
time
was
not
yet
ripe
for
the
shôgun
authority
though
much
weakened
was
still
admitted
and
obeyed
by
a
large
majority
of
the
his
troops
had
not
as
yet
exhibited
their
inferiority
in
arms
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
almost
at
this
very
moment
the
forces
of
the
prince
of
chôshiû
were
suffering
an
overwhelming
defeat
in
their
attack
upon
kiôto
which
was
defended
in
the
tycoon
interest
by
aidzu
and
satsuma
by
the
time
we
returned
to
yokohama
and
before
the
idea
could
have
been
even
considered
by
the
foreign
representatives
chôshiû
principal
men
were
either
fugitives
or
dead
and
the
tycoon
was
temporarily
master
of
the
field
itô
and
his
companion
left
again
during
the
night
i
could
not
help
feeling
sorry
for
their
failure
to
impress
on
their
prince
the
warning
which
they
had
come
all
the
way
from
europe
to
impart
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
we
weighed
anchor
early
on
the
following
morning
and
arrived
at
yokohama
on
the
as
soon
as
it
became
known
that
chôshiû
would
not
give
way
preparations
were
actively
made
for
carrying
out
the
resolutions
previously
agreed
upon
by
the
representatives
of
the
four
powers
they
held
a
conference
with
the
ministers
of
the
shôgun
in
order
to
impress
on
them
that
the
moment
had
now
come
when
the
naval
forces
must
be
charged
with
the
duty
of
opening
the
straits
but
before
the
meeting
had
separated
there
came
like
a
thunderbolt
on
their
deliberations
an
announcement
of
the
return
from
europe
of
a
mission
that
had
been
despatched
in
the
month
of
january
to
treat
with
great
britain
and
france
they
brought
with
them
a
convention
concluded
with
the
latter
power
which
provided
for
an
indemnity
in
respect
of
the
attack
on
the
french
gunboat
for
the
removal
by
the
shôgun
government
within
three
months
of
the
impediments
to
the
navigation
of
the
straits
of
shimonoséki
for
a
modification
of
the
import
tariff
in
favour
of
french
manufactures
and
for
the
payment
of
an
indemnity
of
to
the
relatives
of
lieutenant
camus
this
news
seemed
to
sir
rutherford
alcock
to
threaten
an
utter
collapse
of
his
plans
for
if
the
convention
were
ratified
the
french
at
least
would
be
compelled
to
withdraw
from
the
coalition
but
it
was
of
course
clear
to
those
on
the
spot
that
the
second
article
could
not
be
possibly
carried
out
by
the
tycoon
government
and
never
could
have
been
seriously
intended
at
least
on
the
japanese
side
pressure
was
therefore
put
on
the
council
to
make
them
declare
that
they
would
not
ratify
the
convention
and
a
note
from
them
to
this
effect
reached
the
foreign
representatives
on
the
august
on
the
same
day
they
signed
a
memorandum
declaring
the
necessity
of
a
resort
to
force
which
was
then
communicated
to
the
naval
and
four
days
later
the
allied
squadrons
put
to
sea
to
carry
into
execution
the
plans
decided
on
before
the
return
of
the
envoys
had
for
a
moment
seemed
to
threaten
the
disruption
of
the
diplomatic
union
so
strenuously
worked
for
by
our
chief
it
was
an
immense
responsibility
that
he
had
assumed
there
was
no
telegraph
in
those
days
to
any
point
nearer
than
ceylon
but
a
despatch
dated
july
was
already
on
its
way
to
him
positively
prohibiting
the
adoption
of
military
measures
in
the
interior
of
japan
and
limiting
naval
operations
against
the
japanese
government
or
princes
to
defensive
measures
for
the
protection
of
the
life
and
property
of
british
subjects
by
the
time
it
reached
his
hands
his
schemes
had
already
been
accomplished
with
the
happiest
possible
results
and
he
was
able
to
console
himself
with
the
conviction
that
he
had
done
the
right
thing
even
though
he
might
be
censured
for
acting
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
lord
john
russell
and
have
incurred
the
penalty
of
a
recall
from
his
post
the
united
states
steamer
monitor
had
been
fired
at
as
she
lay
at
anchor
in
a
bay
on
the
north
coast
of
nagato
on
july
this
afforded
fresh
justification
of
the
action
adopted
by
the
foreign
representatives
chapter

shimonoseki
naval
operations
to
my
great
satisfaction
i
was
appointed
interpreter
to

küper

packing
up
a
few
necessaries
embarked
on
board
the
euryalus
i
was
messed
in
the

room

as
there
was
no

slept
on

of
fellows
among
them
i
especially
remember
tracey
and
maclear
both
of
them
now
the
former
is
a
very
distinguished
officer
but
what
particularly
attracted
me
towards
him
was
his
love
of
books
and
his
wide
knowledge
of
modern
languages
acquired
by
dint
of
sheer
perseverance
amid
all
the
noisy

his

gained
him
many
friends
my

been
secretly
taken
away
from

by

as
a
punishment
for
having
accompanied
me
on

years
afterwards
i
was
made
acquainted
with
the
treachery
of

lent
me
his

and
the

of

on
the
following
day
we
had
calm
weather
and
a
smooth
sea
on
the
way
down
sighting
the
corner
of
shikoku
on
the
september
about
we
fell
in
with
the
perseus
commander
kingston
towing
a
collier
and
bringing
the
admiral
mail
the
perseus
had
met
commander
buckle
in
the
cormorant
on
his
way
to
shanghai
for
the
mail
who
having
started
from
yokohama
about
the
time
of
the
return
of
the
japanese
embassy
reported
that
the
expedition
was
indefinitely
postponed
she
had
therefore
cast
off
the
collier
and
steamed
away
at
full
speed
for
yokohama
but
falling
a
little
later
in
with
the
coquette
on
her
way
to
nagasaki
learnt
a
very
different
tale
and
turning
round
had
picked
up
the
collier
again
and
brought
her
on
on
the
following
day
we
reached
himéshima
and
anchored
a
little
after
noon
here
we
found
the
djambi
and
metalen
kruis
shortly
afterwards
the
medusa
and
the
three
french
ships
appeared
and
by
midnight
every
ship
of
the
allied
squadron
had
arrived
we
had
still
to
wait
for
the
coquette
and
either
the
cormorant
or
osprey
in
the
afternoon
the
admiral
captain
alexander
with
other
officers
went
ashore
for
a
walk
and
i
acted
as
their
guide
the
poor
village
mayor
made
his
appearance
in
a
great
state
of
alarm
he
was
indeed
in
an
uncomfortable
position
uncertain
of
the
disposition
of
the
strangers
and
sure
of
punishment
from
his
own
countrymen
if
he
manifested
too
great
friendliness
towards
us
he
promised
however
to
send
us
off
some
fish
quite
privately
but
was
positive
that
he
could
sell
no
bullocks
he
had
despatched
a
messenger
to
kitsuki
to
inquire
whether
the
islanders
might
hold
intercourse
with
the
squadron
and
furnish
us
with
what
supplies
they
had
during
the
night
we
took
in
tons
of
coal
and
the
of
september
was
spent
by
the
rest
of
our
squadron
in
replenishing
their
bunkers
in
the
afternoon
i
went
ashore
to
the
mayor
house
where
i
found
three
of
the
garrison
from
kitsuki
they
were
very
reticent
not
to
say
sulky
and
only
one
of
them
who
was
evidently
afraid
of
his
companions
could
be
induced
to
open
his
mouth
it
was
a
grand
sight
to
see
the
master
of
the
collier
and
his
wife
parading
along
the
beach
with
a
couple
of
dirty
little
village
urchins
running
ahead
of
them
the
common
people
were
friendly
enough
except
when
the
eyes
of
the
men
were
upon
them
on
the
september
we
weighed
anchor
at
nine
and
proceeded
towards
the
straits
of
shimonoséki
the
eight
british
ships
in
the
centre
with
euryalus
leading
the
french
squadron
and
the
takiang
in
a
line
on
the
left
and
the
four
dutch
vessels
on
the
right
it
was
a
beautiful
show
as
the
allied
squadrons
steamed
in
the
consciousness
of
irresistible
strength
calmly
across
the
unruffled
surface
of
this
inland
sea
which
lay
before
us
like
a
glassy
mirror
in
its
framework
of
blue
hills
towards
half
past
three
we
anchored
at
a
distance
of
about
two
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
straits
and
prepared
for
action
everything
was
in
readiness
by
the
time
we
had
got
through
our
dinner
but
to
the
disappointment
of
the
more
eager
spirits
we
remained
where
we
were
without
firing
a
shot
every
one
was
naturally
very
anxious
that
no
new
complication
should
arise
to
delay
the
encounter
with
the
enemy
early
on
the
following
morning
two
chôshiû
men
common
soldiers
came
on
board
to
inquire
why
all
these
had
come
to
the
straits
but
the
admiral
refused
to
hold
any
parley
with
men
of
evidently
inferior
rank
and
they
were
told
to
return
on
shore
at
once
one
of
them
told
me
very
innocently
that
if
we
intended
to
go
through
he
must
go
on
shore
to
make
preparations
for
us
and
when
i
asked
what
preparation
he
said
for
fighting
i
was
then
sent
in
a
boat
to
overhaul
a
couple
of
junks
that
in
the
meanwhile
had
been
stopped
as
they
were
entering
the
straits
one
was
the
isé
maru
of
matsuyama
in
iyo
going
to
load
coals
at
hirado
the
other
belonged
to
kurumé
in
chikugo
and
was
returning
from
ozaka
with
a
miscellaneous
cargo
as
they
did
not
belong
to
the
enemy
we
let
them
go
about
two
the
two
men
who
had
previously
visited
the
ship
came
on
board
again
to
announce
the
arrival
of
a
or
commissioner
of
some
sort
accompanied
by
inouyé
bunda
he
had
now
laid
aside
his
alias
of
shiji
but
signals
had
already
been
made
to
the
captains
to
take
up
the
positions
allotted
to
them
for
shelling
the
batteries
and
when
my
friend
inouyé
and
his
companion
reached
the
flagship
the
only
answer
they
received
to
their
request
that
hostilities
might
be
deferred
with
a
view
to
negotiation
was
that
the
time
for
a
peaceable
arrangement
had
passed
we
went
into
action
at
ten
minutes
past
four
the
barrosa
tartar
djambi
metalen
kruis
leopard
and
dupleix
moved
along
the
southern
coast
of
the
entrance
to
the
strait
and
took
up
their
station
in
front
of
tanoura
as
shown
in
the
annexed
plan
while
a
light
squadron
consisting
of
the
perseus
medusa
tancrède
coquette
and
bouncer
passed
along
the
northern
shore
the
amsterdam
and
argus
being
held
in
reserve
the
euryalus
sémiramis
conqueror
and
takiang
anchored
out
of
range
of
the
enemy
batteries
at
a
distance
of
about
yards
from
the
central
cluster
at
maeda
mura
and
consequently
near
enough
to
reach
them
with
our
armstrong
gun
on
the
forecastle
the
first
shot
was
fired
from
the
euryalus
and
the
whole
of
the
tanoura
squadron
then
followed
her
example
the
light
squadron
speedily
silenced
the
battery
on
kushi
saki
point
but
not
before
it
had
managed
to
pitch
a
shot
pretty
near
the
british
flagship
then
the
sémiramis
which
had
been
occupied
in
getting
springs
on
her
cable
opened
fire
from
her
guns
with
terrible
effect
scarcely
a
shot
falling
short
the
takiang
did
her
best
with
her
single
gun
and
the
conqueror
fired
three
shells
one
of
which
burst
beautifully
among
the
great
cluster
of
batteries
the
euryalus
fired
only
sixteen
rounds
between
and
from
her
which
was
pretty
good
work
considering
that
the
vent
piece
got
jammed
once
and
a
considerable
time
was
lost
in
digging
it
out
with
handspikes
another
time
the
vent
piece
was
blown
up
into
the
owing
to
its
not
having
been
screwed
in
tightly
enough
the
six
vessels
anchored
south
were
soon
engaged
in
a
sharp
conflict
with
the
batteries
opposite
while
the
light
squadron
having
silenced
the
batteries
on
the
north
came
to
their
aid
enfilading
the
and
batteries
the
furthest
shot
fired
from
the
euryalus
was
at
yards
and
it
went
plump
into
a
battery
illustration
the
straits
of
shimonoseki
by
the
principal
batteries
had
been
silenced
and
a
signal
was
made
to
discontinue
firing
a
fire
now
burst
out
among
the
buildings
in
the
maeda
mura
batteries
and
a
magazine
exploded
making
the
third
during
the
afternoon
we
continued
firing
a
shot
now
and
then
up
to
six
the
armstrongs
were
fired
once
only
as
their
range
proved
to
be
too
short
and
none
of
the
guns
on
the
main
deck
were
brought
into
action
to
the
great
disappointment
of
the
bluejackets
who
had
probably
not
forgotten
the
slaughter
made
amongst
their
comrades
at
kagoshima
and
burned
to
avenge
it
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
japanese
fought
well
and
with
great
persistence
for
i
attach
no
value
to
the
story
that
was
told
that
the
gunners
were
only
allowed
to
fire
once
and
were
then
replaced
by
fresh
men
at
first
many
of
our
shot
fell
short
but
when
the
range
was
found
they
struck
the
batteries
every
moment
as
we
could
see
by
the
clouds
of
dust
that
were
knocked
up
after
the
signal
to
discontinue
firing
had
been
made
kingston
of
the
perseus
and
de
casembroot
of
the
medusa
landed
and
spiked
fourteen
guns
in
the
maeda
mura
batteries
at
the
small
battery
on
kushi
saki
point
two
out
of
the
three
guns
had
been
dismounted
by
our
fire
the
entire
casualties
on
our
side
this
first
day
were
six
men
wounded
in
the
tartar
which
bore
the
brunt
of
the
fire
early
on
the
following
morning
one
of
the
maeda
mura
batteries
fire
on
the
squadron
anchored
off
tanoura
but
was
replied
to
with
such
effect
that
it
was
speedily
silenced
and
the
barrack
behind
was
set
on
fire
the
dupleix
lost
two
killed
and
two
wounded
while
the
first
lieutenant
of
the
tartar
was
struck
by
a
round
shot
on
the
posteriors
and
severely
wounded
he
recovered
however
contrary
to
the
expectations
of
the
surgeons
i
slept
through
the
noise
but
was
woke
by
somebody
with
a
message
that
i
had
to
land
with
captain
alexander
who
was
to
command
the
party
of
the
euryalus
strong
from
the
conqueror
there
landed
the
battalion
of
marines
under
colonel
suther
besides
her
own
complement
of
and
some
bluejackets
small
detachments
of
marines
being
added
from
the
other
ships
of
our
squadron
the
french
landed
and
the
dutch
another
calculation
showed
that
men
were
put
ashore
of
whom
we
furnished
we
rowed
straight
for
the
nearest
land
followed
by
a
string
of
cutters
and
pinnaces
so
full
of
men
that
there
was
only
just
room
to
work
the
oars
and
got
on
shore
at
nine
exactly
the
task
assigned
to
captain
alexander
party
was
to
scale
a
bluff
immediately
to
the
east
of
the
maeda
mura
batteries
and
take
a
battery
it
was
a
stiff
pull
up
the
steep
grassy
hill
but
up
went
the
bluejackets
as
if
they
were
out
on
a
picnic
every
man
for
himself
on
climbing
over
the
earthwork
we
found
that
the
gun
had
been
either
carried
off
or
concealed
there
were
a
score
or
so
of
the
enemy
on
the
platform
who
retreated
as
soon
as
the
first
of
our
people
showed
his
nose
above
the
parapet
but
they
kept
up
a
dropping
fire
from
the
other
side
of
the
hill
here
one
of
our
men
received
a
bullet
wound
in
the
leg
and
a
second
was
accidentally
shot
through
the
body
by
the
sailor
immediately
behind
him
passing
through
the
battery
we
clambered
up
the
hill
behind
through
a
tangled
brake
of
ferns
and
creepers
the
heat
was
intense
it
was
a
difficult
job
to
keep
one
footing
on
the
narrow
path
cut
through
the
slippery
grass
our
bluejackets
were
very
eager
to
get
at
the
enemy
but
not
a
single
one
was
to
be
seen
descending
the
other
side
of
the
hill
we
at
last
found
ourselves
in
a
sort
of
covered
way
which
ran
along
the
side
of
a
narrow
valley
it
was
reported
that
the
enemy
were
posted
further
up
the
valley
in
considerable
numbers
but
instead
of
pursuing
them
we
turned
to
the
left
along
the
covered
way
which
brought
us
down
past
a
magazine
into
the
central
battery
of
the
principal
group
it
turned
out
afterwards
to
be
a
fortunate
for
if
we
had
proceeded
in
the
other
direction
we
should
have
stumbled
on
a
stockade
defended
by
three
field
guns
which
would
have
played
old
harry
with
our
small
force
the
first
battery
we
entered
was
already
in
the
possession
of
the
french
landing
party
and
some
of
our
marines
who
having
disembarked
below
the
bluff
had
marched
along
the
beach
meeting
with
no
opposition
this
work
was
of
earth
having
a
parapet
about
twenty
feet
wide
armed
along
the
edge
with
a
of
pointed
bamboo
stakes
in
battery
no
the
guns
were
mounted
en
barbette
on
carriages
with
enormous
wheels
and
worked
on
pivots
they
were
of
bronze
very
long
and
threw
a
shot
though
marked
as
they
bore
a
japanese
date
corresponding
to
and
had
evidently
been
cast
in
yedo
besides
these
there
was
a
short
and
on
the
other
side
of
a
traverse
containing
a
small
magazine
was
a
single
gun
also
of
bronze
we
upset
them
all
broke
up
the
carriages
threw
the
shot
and
shell
into
the
sea
burned
the
powder
and
even
dragged
a
couple
of
guns
down
on
to
the
beach
this
occupied
us
till
three
or
four
in
the
afternoon
during
this
time
our
men
were
perpetually
firing
musketry
at
the
enemy
on
the
hill
who
every
now
and
then
showed
themselves
to
give
us
a
shot
or
two
in
the
battery
were
a
couple
of
heavy
bronze
guns
afterwards
we
proceeded
to
the
next
battery
which
was
almost
fleur
d
it
was
divided
into
two
by
a
traverse
containing
a
magazine
on
one
side
of
which
were
one
howitzer
two
and
one
on
the
other
side
were
the
same
number
with
the
addition
of
a
single
these
likewise
were
overturned
and
the
carriages
and
ammunition
disposed
of
as
before
the
japanese
field
battery
up
the
valley
which
had
been
advanced
some
little
way
from
the
stockade
along
a
path
leading
towards
maeda
mura
dannoura
and
shimonoséki
annoyed
us
considerably
during
this
operation
firing
shells
over
us
and
at
long
ranges
into
the
sea
while
their
musketeers
kept
up
a
pretty
constant
fire
though
no
one
was
touched
on
our
side
part
of
our
men
were
told
off
to
keep
them
in
check
but
our
aim
was
not
much
better
than
that
of
the
enemy
the
great
thing
in
war
until
you
come
to
close
quarters
seems
to
be
to
make
as
much
noise
as
you
can
to
put
your
foes
in
a
funk
or
in
other
words
to
demoralize
them
you
ca
do
much
harm
and
it
was
laughable
to
see
how
many
of
our
men
ducked
to
avoid
the
shot
and
i
confess
i
followed
their
example
until
reason
came
to
my
aid
the
medusa
moved
up
and
threw
a
few
shells
in
among
them
while
the
perseus
amsterdam
and
argus
fired
over
the
hill
from
their
station
before
tanoura
this
quieted
the
zeal
of
our
warrior
foes
for
a
while
and
we
returned
to
the
first
battery
we
had
dismantled
for
the
men
to
have
their
dinners
crowdy
of
the
engineers
mcbean
the
of
the
flagship
and
i
divided
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
tin
of
sardines
which
we
opened
with
crowdy
sword
there
were
no
knives
or
forks
handy
but
that
did
not
hinder
us
from
satisfying
our
appetite
as
we
sat
on
the
steps
of
the
magazine
in
the
traverse
after
dinner
we
helped
the
french
to
overturn
the
guns
in
their
battery
which
were
four
in
number
very
long
mounted
on
field
carriages
the
enemy
still
continued
annoying
us
from
their
position
up
the
valley
while
some
of
our
men
kept
up
a
fitful
musketry
fire
in
reply
without
much
damage
on
either
side
the
afternoon
being
already
far
advanced
the
signal
to
was
made
from
the
euryalus
and
the
french
and
dutch
detachments
some
of
the
marine
detachment
and
the
conqueror
men
were
already
in
their
boats
when
about
six
we
saw
colonel
battalion
of
marines
returning
from
the
maeda
mura
battery
through
a
heavy
fire
from
the
japanese
the
japanese
on
perceiving
them
threw
a
round
shot
in
among
them
but
without
doing
any
harm
our
men
replied
and
for
fifteen
minutes
there
was
nothing
but
ping
ping
ping
on
both
sides
at
last
the
colonel
came
up
to
captain
alexander
and
said
where
are
these
men
who
are
annoying
us
i
enough
men
to
take
any
battery
all
right
replied
alexander
i
take
the
left
side
of
the
valley
and
you
the
right
so
the
marines
clambered
up
into
the
french
battery
the
one
and
proceeded
up
the
covered
way
while
the
conqueror
men
disembarked
again
and
the
advance
commenced
beato
and
i
stuck
close
to
alexander
and
followed
the
bluejackets
across
the
paddyfields
by
the
narrow
bunds
and
then
along
the
path
on
the
western
side
of
the
valley
how
the
bluejackets
shouted
and
cheered
each
man
running
on
by
himself
now
stopping
to
take
aim
at
an
enemy
from
behind
one
of
the
pine
trees
that
lined
the
edge
of
the
road
and
then
on
again
there
was
no
order
or
discipline
some
of
them
wasted
their
ammunition
on
imaginary
foes
on
the
hillsides
i
passed
several
wounded
men
as
i
went
up
some
seriously
hurt
and
the
corpse
of
a
sailor
who
had
been
killed
by
an
arrow
at
last
we
reached
the
battery
whence
the
gunners
had
been
driven
by
our
fire
dismounted
the
guns
and
threw
them
into
the
paddyfield
close
by
after
destroying
the
carriages
here
alexander
was
wounded
by
a
ball
which
passed
through
the
of
his
right
foot
and
he
had
to
be
carried
to
the
rear
on
a
stretcher
from
this
point
the
valley
contracted
rapidly
while
immediately
in
front
of
us
was
a
stockaded
barrack
into
which
most
of
the
japanese
retreated
turning
back
repeatedly
to
fire
but
i
saw
others
in
black
armour
and
white
surcoats
retreating
with
great
rapidity
along
the
road
to
the
left
lieutenant
edwards
and
crowdy
of
the
engineers
were
ahead
with
a
middy
named
boyes
who
carried
the
colours
most
gallantly
he
afterwards
received
the
for
conduct
very
plucky
in
one
so
young
when
i
got
up
to
the
front
of
the
stockade
there
were
three
or
four
dead
japanese
lying
about
and
one
of
our
men
shot
through
the
heart
he
presented
a
most
ghastly
sight
as
he
lay
there
getting
visibly
bluer
and
bluer
without
any
exterior
signs
of
blood
to
show
how
he
had
come
by
his
death
having
directed
some
of
the
men
to
put
his
corpse
into
a
huge
oblong
basket
which
was
on
the
ground
close
by
and
carry
him
off
i
passed
on
into
the
stockade
whence
the
japanese
had
already
fled
in
retiring
they
had
set
fire
to
some
houses
close
to
the
magazine
with
the
amiable
intention
of
blowing
us
up
but
the
train
was
discovered
and
the
explosion
prevented
after
ranging
over
the
whole
place
and
removing
whatever
was
worth
carrying
off
as
trophies
such
as
armour
bows
and
arrows
spears
and
swords
and
bayonets
bearing
a
foreign
maker
name
we
set
fire
to
the
buildings
and
retired
in
good
order
the
loss
of
the
enemy
was
about
twenty
killed
but
they
had
carried
off
all
their
wounded
we
had
five
killed
and
thirteen
or
fourteen
wounded
two
mortally
what
the
marine
battalion
was
doing
all
this
time
i
can
not
say
for
the
excitement
about
what
was
going
on
ahead
left
me
no
disposition
to
look
elsewhere
but
i
rather
think
that
having
marched
along
the
covered
way
with
great
steadiness
they
managed
to
arrive
just
as
the
more
active
and
impetuous
jacks
had
finished
the
business
and
no
blame
to
them
either
for
going
about
their
work
in
a
manner
if
we
had
met
with
a
check
in
our
heedless
headlong
advance
the
marines
would
have
saved
us
from
destruction
it
was
lucky
for
us
that
the
skirmish
terminated
as
it
did
for
our
loss
in
men
would
have
been
much
greater
if
the
japanese
had
been
strong
enough
to
stand
to
their
guns
or
had
posted
marksmen
on
the
hills
to
take
us
in
flank
as
we
hurried
up
the
valley
they
had
the
advantage
in
position
besides
possessing
seven
small
field
pieces
while
on
the
other
hand
we
had
at
least
a
couple
of
hundred
men
in
excess
of
their
number
which
it
was
supposed
was
but
i
fancy
i
remember
having
heard
since
from
a
chôshiû
man
who
was
present
that
their
force
was
only
one
half
of
that
the
bluejackets
bore
the
brunt
of
the
business
as
they
had
to
cross
the
line
of
fire
and
to
advance
along
the
outer
edge
of
the
valley
which
curved
away
to
the
east
out
of
sight
of
the
shipping
the
japanese
could
not
stand
our
advance
the
sharp
musketry
fire
threw
them
into
disorder
and
they
had
to
run
for
it
in
only
one
case
was
an
attempt
made
to
come
to
close
quarters
one
fellow
had
concealed
himself
behind
a
door
with
uplifted
sword
in
both
hands
ready
to
cut
down
a
man
just
about
to
enter
but
contrary
to
his
expectation
his
intended
victim
gave
him
a
prod
in
the
belly
which
laid
him
on
his
back
and
spoilt
his
little
game
our
french
companions
in
arms
were
disgusted
at
not
having
been
present
at
the
affair
and
turned
up
their
noses
at
it
as
grand
chose
après
it
was
the
fortune
of
war
and
we
commiserated
them
sincerely
illustration
interior
of
a
japanese
battery
after
the
landing
of
the
allied
naval
forces
the
marines
who
in
the
first
instance
marched
on
maeda
mura
had
one
man
killed
and
two
wounded
they
dismantled
fifteen
guns
in
the
battery
there
during
the
day
a
boat
belonging
to
one
of
the
dutch
with
two
men
in
her
got
loose
and
drifted
down
with
the
tide
towards
the
town
they
were
immediately
shot
though
quite
defenceless
fred
lowder
and
his
brother
george
who
had
come
up
with
him
from
nagasaki
to
see
the
fun
had
a
narrow
escape
as
they
were
paddling
about
in
a
japanese
boat
which
became
unmanageable
and
was
drifting
off
in
the
same
direction
they
jumped
into
the
water
and
swam
ashore
or
they
would
probably
have
encountered
the
same
fate
the
eastern
end
of
the
town
of
shimonoséki
more
properly
speaking
i
believe
akamagaséki
was
set
on
fire
but
the
number
of
houses
burnt
was
extremely
small
it
was
alleged
that
this
was
done
by
the
french
because
some
japanese
soldiers
had
fired
thence
on
their
men
but
i
do
not
know
whether
this
is
a
fact
the
perseus
ran
ashore
opposite
the
nearest
batteries
and
as
the
tide
ebbed
her
bow
was
high
out
of
the
water
nor
did
she
get
off
again
until
the
following
day
i
found
myself
on
board
again
at
seven
very
dirty
very
tired
very
hungry
and
very
thirsty
on
the
september
working
parties
of
bluejackets
landed
under
the
protection
of
some
marines
to
take
possession
of
the
guns
ten
of
which
they
got
into
the
boats
others
went
up
to
the
stockade
and
found
some
field
pieces
which
they
destroyed
hove
down
wells
or
brought
away
we
got
together
sixty
all
but
one
of
bronze
with
two
mortars
and
six
cohorns
we
blew
up
all
the
powder
and
threw
the
shot
and
shell
into
the
sea
there
was
not
a
single
hostile
japanese
to
be
seen
the
perseus
had
to
be
lightened
by
discharging
all
her
guns
and
coals
and
so
managed
to
get
afloat
by
noon
our
list
of
casualties
during
the
two
days
operation
was
eight
killed
and
thirty
wounded
of
whom
one
or
two
were
not
expected
to
live
we
landed
at
one
on
the
tanoura
side
to
bury
our
dead
the
french
having
already
buried
two
in
the
forenoon
in
digging
the
graves
our
men
found
particles
of
a
glittering
substance
which
was
at
first
taken
to
be
gold
dust
but
turned
out
to
be
mica
i
met
a
party
of
men
who
asked
how
many
dead
we
had
and
how
we
had
fared
on
the
previous
day
on
learning
what
a
complete
thrashing
we
had
given
the
enemy
at
the
stockade
they
expressed
great
satisfaction
and
recounted
how
the
chôshiû
people
had
crossed
over
the
straits
in
the
previous
year
cut
down
their
crops
carried
off
their
live
stock
and
driven
the
peasants
away
after
which
they
held
possession
of
tanoura
for
some
time
until
public
opinion
and
the
necessity
of
providing
for
the
defence
of
chôshiû
own
territories
had
compelled
them
to
withdraw
ogasawara
men
feared
that
when
chôshiû
came
to
find
out
that
communication
had
taken
place
between
us
and
the
buzen
folk
he
would
visit
them
again
after
the
withdrawal
of
the
squadron
but
i
boldly
assured
them
that
they
need
not
alarm
themselves
as
we
intended
to
destroy
the
batteries
and
deprive
chôshiû
of
his
territory
for
i
knew
that
part
of
the
plan
entertained
by
sir
rutherford
and
his
colleagues
was
the
seizure
of
a
sufficient
piece
of
territory
near
shimonoséki
as
a
material
guarantee
for
the
payment
of
an
adequate
indemnity
and
to
hold
it
until
it
could
be
conveniently
handed
over
to
the
government
sir
rutherford
contemplated
nothing
less
than
the
complete
subjugation
of
the
chôshiû
clan
and
he
had
enjoined
upon
the
admiral
the
necessity
of
attacking
hagi
which
was
supposed
to
be
the
stronghold
of
the
the
admiral
however
who
was
a
prudent
commander
and
by
no
means
disposed
to
take
orders
from
the
civil
representatives
of
her
majesty
further
than
he
was
obliged
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
resources
at
his
disposal
did
not
permit
of
a
permanent
occupation
of
any
portion
of
chôshiû
territory
and
considered
that
as
soon
as
the
forts
were
destroyed
and
the
straits
opened
his
task
was
accomplished
fear
had
made
the
ogasawara
wondrously
polite
the
villagers
were
also
friendly
enough
and
i
made
them
laugh
with
some
commonplace
jokes
but
did
not
succeed
in
inducing
them
to
sell
any
supplies
the
officials
after
hunting
all
through
the
village
as
they
assured
us
produced
eight
or
ten
eggs
which
they
said
was
all
they
could
find
our
bluejackets
brought
me
some
papers
which
they
had
picked
up
in
the
stockade
and
which
appeared
to
contain
evidences
of
plots
by
chôshiû
against
the
mikado
also
quantities
of
pills
made
or
said
to
be
made
from
bear
gall
and
banknotes
for
small
sums
such
as
were
commonly
used
in
the
territories
of
all
the
i
believe
that
silver
coin
was
current
at
that
time
in
the
dominions
of
the
tycoon
alone
on
the
fatigue
parties
landed
again
to
bring
off
more
guns
we
got
all
but
two
from
the
group
of
batteries
which
made
nineteen
besides
fifteen
from
maeda
mura
and
an
equal
number
from
the
batteries
on
hikushima
the
large
island
in
the
western
entrance
of
the
straits
i
went
on
shore
to
maeda
mura
and
found
a
well
built
battery
with
a
parapet
twenty
feet
wide
cased
with
stone
towards
the
sea
and
divided
into
four
sections
by
traverses
between
which
the
guns
were
planted
in
unequal
numbers
in
the
rear
stood
a
magazine
the
roof
of
which
had
been
smashed
by
a
round
shot
that
went
right
through
it
the
powder
magazine
also
of
stone
which
stood
on
one
side
of
the
valley
behind
had
been
blown
up
the
previous
day
further
up
was
a
stockaded
barrack
which
the
french
had
burned
i
went
towards
the
advanced
guard
near
the
town
but
as
the
enemy
began
to
show
themselves
and
fire
at
us
i
made
a
prudent
retreat
chapter
xi
shimonoseki
peace
concluded
with
chôshiû
returning
to
the
ship
at
noon
i
found
there
my
acquaintance
itô
shunsuké
who
had
come
to
say
that
chôshiû
desired
peace
and
that
a
or
hereditary
councillor
provided
with
full
powers
was
coming
off
to
treat
a
boat
was
accordingly
despatched
to
meet
the
great
man
who
shortly
afterwards
stood
on
the
of
the
flagship
he
was
dressed
in
a
robe
called
the
which
was
covered
with
large
light
blue
crests
the
paulownia
leaf
and
flower
on
a
yellow
ground
and
wore
on
his
head
a
black
silk
cap
which
he
took
off
on
passing
the
gangway
his
queue
was
then
seen
to
be
loose
hanging
over
the
back
of
his
head
like
a
tassel
and
his
white
silk
underclothing
was
a
marvel
of
purity
his
two
companions
who
bore
a
rank
next
only
to
his
own
wore
their
hair
in
the
same
fashion
but
were
without
mantles
they
were
conducted
into
the
cabin
and
presented
to
the
admirals
the
abbé
girard
lowder
and
myself
acting
as
interpreters
they
began
by
stating
that
the
prince
of
chôshiû
acknowledged
his
defeat
and
desired
to
make
peace
with
a
view
to
the
establishment
of
friendly
relations
the
admiral
thereupon
asked
to
see
their
credentials
and
finding
they
had
none
intimated
that
he
would
give
them
hours
to
provide
themselves
with
a
letter
from
their
they
were
told
that
the
letter
must
contain
the
substance
of
what
they
had
said
acknowledging
that
he
had
committed
a
grievous
wrong
in
firing
upon
foreign
ships
and
begging
for
peace
that
it
must
be
signed
with
his
own
hand
and
sealed
with
his
seal
and
that
a
copy
must
be
addressed
to
each
of
the
four
senior
naval
officers
in
command
the
conditions
imposed
were
first
that
we
should
continue
to
remove
the
guns
and
destroy
the
forts
second
that
we
would
discontinue
hostilities
they
on
their
side
doing
the
same
but
that
if
they
fired
another
shot
we
should
burn
everything
we
could
lay
our
hands
on
in
chôshiû
territories
third
they
must
deliver
up
intact
the
dutch
sailors
and
boat
which
had
fallen
into
their
hands
on
the
and
fourth
that
they
should
endeavour
to
induce
the
villagers
to
bring
off
poultry
and
fresh
vegetables
for
sale
in
order
that
they
might
have
a
token
of
a
peaceable
disposition
on
our
part
a
white
flag
should
be
hoisted
at
the
main
until
the
expiration
of
the
time
fixed
for
their
return
they
gave
as
their
names
shishido
giôma
adopted
son
of
shishido
bizen
minister
of
nagato
sugi
tokusuké
and
watanabé
kurata
councillors
they
then
returned
on
shore
leaving
communications
addressed
to
each
of
the
commanders
of
the
allied
squadron
which
they
had
been
charged
to
deliver
at
himéshima
before
the
bombardment
they
handed
these
over
at
the
admiral
desire
remarking
that
we
should
perceive
from
the
contents
that
the
documents
were
useless
now
itô
gave
me
also
transcripts
of
the
orders
received
from
the
mikado
and
the
tycoon
to
expel
foreigners
from
japan
which
shishido
certified
with
his
own
hand
to
be
true
copies
the
translations
made
of
these
papers
were
afterwards
published
in
the
bluebook
on
japan
where
the
curious
can
consult
them
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
were
perfectly
authentic
it
was
amusing
to
observe
the
change
which
manifested
itself
gradually
in
the
demeanour
of
the
envoy
who
was
as
proud
as
lucifer
when
he
stepped
on
board
but
gradually
toned
down
and
agreed
to
every
proposal
without
making
any
objections
itô
seemed
to
exercise
great
influence
over
him
after
the
truce
was
agreed
to
the
country
people
ventured
freely
along
the
road
near
the
batteries
and
passed
on
into
the
town
no
doubt
heartily
pleased
at
the
termination
of
hostilities
it
must
be
said
to
their
credit
that
the
terms
were
faithfully
adhered
to
by
the
chôshiû
people
none
of
whom
except
itô
and
inouyé
had
supposed
europeans
to
be
any
better
than
mere
barbarians
on
the
september
the
coquette
took
the
two
admirals
through
the
straits
to
visit
the
batteries
on
hikushima
and
as
usual
i
accompanied
them
to
interpret
from
the
eastern
side
the
strait
contracts
rapidly
between
lofty
hills
to
a
width
of
no
more
than
six
lengths
and
then
as
quickly
opens
out
again
with
the
long
line
of
houses
forming
the
town
of
shimonoséki
on
the
northern
shore
while
to
the
left
the
coast
trends
away
southwards
past
the
village
of
moji
and
the
town
of
kokura
in
front
lay
the
broad
undulating
hikushima
passing
right
out
through
the
strait
till
we
reached
the
corner
of
the
island
we
turned
back
again
and
came
along
its
coast
passing
a
little
cove
crowded
with
junks
till
we
came
to
lime
point
here
we
disembarked
to
inspect
the
site
of
the
batteries
from
which
the
guns
had
already
been
removed
by
our
people
one
of
the
batteries
which
originally
had
six
guns
mounted
was
cut
out
of
the
cliff
and
there
had
evidently
not
been
time
to
complete
it
immediately
below
the
parapet
was
a
single
gun
in
a
pit
a
little
further
east
was
a
battery
of
eight
guns
mounted
fleur
and
close
by
was
a
smaller
battery
with
four
embrasures
which
had
never
been
armed
the
only
other
sign
of
a
battery
on
this
island
was
an
old
earthwork
to
the
west
of
lime
point
also
without
guns
kokura
appeared
to
be
strongly
fortified
and
it
was
reported
that
the
chôshiû
people
had
demanded
but
unsuccessfully
to
be
allowed
to
work
the
batteries
against
us
the
tartar
dupleix
djambi
and
metalen
kruis
had
been
stationed
here
since
the
chiefly
for
the
purpose
of
dismantling
the
batteries
leaving
them
we
steamed
up
to
kushi
saki
point
where
three
brass
and
four
guns
had
been
taken
the
latter
were
about
four
feet
long
and
were
constructed
of
single
logs
with
a
bore
about
eight
inches
in
diameter
having
a
chamber
behind
capable
of
holding
about
a
pound
and
a
half
of
powder
bamboo
hoops
surrounded
the
gun
from
breech
to
muzzle
then
came
a
layer
of
boards
and
then
more
bamboo
hoops
the
wood
itself
was
only
about
in
thick
the
shot
consisted
of
a
small
bag
of
pebbles
fastened
to
a
wooden
disk
and
was
intended
to
act
like
grape
at
close
quarters
against
a
landing
party
these
curious
weapons
were
simply
laid
on
the
earthen
parapet
and
were
not
calculated
to
be
used
more
than
once
the
japanese
had
shown
themselves
very
friendly
to
the
working
party
and
had
themselves
carried
down
the
guns
for
delivery
they
were
not
improbably
glad
to
get
rid
of
the
toys
that
had
brought
them
into
so
much
trouble
on
returning
to
the
flagship
we
found
a
couple
of
boats
laden
with
fowls
and
vegetables
which
shiji
bunda
had
sent
on
board
as
a
present
there
was
a
note
from
him
saying
that
the
common
people
were
much
too
frightened
to
come
near
us
to
sell
supplies
and
complaining
that
one
of
the
ships
had
been
firing
again
an
action
which
he
said
would
tend
to
endanger
the
friendly
relations
so
recently
established
but
this
was
a
mistake
on
his
part
for
no
incident
of
the
kind
had
occurred
the
bumboatmen
were
shown
over
the
ship
and
expressed
themselves
much
delighted
with
the
novel
and
wonderful
sight
we
sent
half
of
shiji
present
to
the
french
admiral
and
our
share
was
divided
among
the
officers
and
men
of
the
flagship
on
the
following
day
the
envoys
of
the
prince
of
chôshiû
arrived
punctually
on
board
the
euryalus
shishido
and
sugi
however
did
not
make
their
appearance
their
absence
being
explained
to
be
caused
by
illness
from
want
of
sleep
and
the
hot
weather
in
combination
admiral
küper
observed
that
it
was
singular
how
often
this
sort
of
thing
happened
and
ironically
begged
that
if
the
negotiations
were
not
concluded
in
one
sitting
the
delegates
would
take
care
of
their
health
until
everything
was
settled
their
names
were
môri
idzumo
minister
uyemon
hadano
kingo
hadano
was
afterwards
better
known
as
hirozawa
hiôsuké
and
watanabé
kurata
councillors
and
isota
kenzô
and
harata
junji
of
chôfu
councillors
with
shiji
bunda
we
had
looked
up
the
japanese
in
the
meantime
and
fancied
we
had
reason
to
suppose
the
previous
envoy
had
given
an
incorrect
account
of
his
position
but
they
were
able
to
clear
up
the
discrepancy
in
a
satisfactory
manner
the
officer
there
called
shishido
mino
had
recently
changed
his
name
to
shishido
bizen
and
retired
from
public
life
in
favour
of
giôma
who
now
represented
the
family
they
produced
a
letter
from
their
prince
which
on
being
read
was
found
to
declare
in
satisfactory
terms
that
he
sued
for
peace
the
admiral
then
said
we
quite
agree
with
your
prince
in
desiring
peace
it
was
never
our
intention
to
fight
your
countrymen
we
solely
desire
to
cement
amicable
relations
between
japan
and
foreign
countries
and
to
carry
on
trade
môri
replied
that
these
were
entirely
the
views
held
by
the
prince
do
you
wish
us
distinctly
to
understand
that
you
will
offer
no
further
opposition
to
the
free
passage
of
the
straits
we
do
we
should
like
very
much
to
have
an
interview
with
the
prince
for
we
could
concede
much
to
him
that
we
could
not
perhaps
concede
to
you
we
are
ourselves
of
high
rank
in
our
own
country
but
will
come
on
shore
to
meet
him
at
shimonoséki
after
consulting
among
themselves
they
named
the
september
as
the
date
on
which
he
should
come
down
from
his
capital
to
receive
the
two
admirals
in
the
town
we
will
first
state
our
demands
which
can
be
ratified
by
the
prince
when
he
comes
we
shall
then
be
able
to
explain
to
him
many
matters
connected
with
the
customs
of
foreign
countries
which
will
prevent
mistakes
arising
in
future
in
any
case
the
transaction
of
business
will
be
facilitated
and
time
will
be
saved
by
the
coming
as
in
any
case
his
ratification
has
to
be
obtained
to
the
terms
agreed
on
in
the
first
place
no
batteries
must
be
constructed
in
the
straits
until
all
questions
between
foreigners
and
japanese
have
been
settled
by
the
tycoon
government
and
the
foreign
ministers
at
yedo
secondly
according
to
the
custom
of
foreign
nations
in
time
of
war
a
ransom
for
the
town
of
shimonoséki
must
be
paid
because
we
spared
it
when
we
had
a
perfect
right
to
set
it
on
fire
for
our
people
had
been
fired
on
from
the
houses
the
amount
shall
be
communicated
to
the
prince
himself
at
the
conference
which
is
to
take
place
thirdly
when
foreign
vessels
passing
through
the
straits
are
in
need
of
coals
provisions
or
water
they
shall
be
permitted
to
purchase
what
they
want
these
conditions
were
readily
accepted
by
the
envoy
who
said
that
as
the
tides
were
very
strong
in
the
straits
and
both
wind
and
waves
sometimes
violent
persons
in
distress
should
be
permitted
to
land
the
admiral
then
informed
him
that
during
our
stay
we
should
go
on
shore
at
shimonoséki
to
buy
whatever
we
required
and
requested
him
to
tell
the
townspeople
to
bring
together
for
sale
what
they
could
in
fact
to
start
a
market
for
the
fleet
to
this
they
at
first
objected
on
the
ground
that
the
town
had
been
completely
abandoned
by
its
inhabitants
but
eventually
agreed
to
do
what
was
desired
then
môri
got
up
and
leaning
over
to
me
said
confidentially
that
there
was
one
thing
about
which
he
was
very
anxious
the
peace
they
had
obtained
was
a
most
precious
and
valuable
thing
and
they
would
greatly
regret
if
any
untoward
event
were
to
injure
our
present
friendly
relations
it
might
happen
that
an
person
would
lie
in
wait
to
attack
foreigners
and
to
prevent
anything
of
this
kind
occurring
he
begged
that
those
who
went
ashore
would
be
on
their
guard
this
was
interpreted
to
admiral
küper
who
at
once
replied
that
we
had
no
fear
of
any
such
evilly
disposed
persons
but
that
if
a
single
european
were
hurt
the
whole
town
should
be
burnt
to
the
ground
the
japanese
authorities
he
added
were
in
the
habit
of
saying
this
sort
of
thing
solely
to
prevent
our
landing
and
it
looked
to
him
a
little
suspicious
môri
answered
that
he
feared
the
purity
of
his
intentions
in
giving
this
warning
was
not
understood
he
was
sure
the
japanese
authorities
would
on
their
part
take
every
precaution
to
prevent
mishaps
and
he
had
only
mentioned
this
to
prevent
mistakes
very
well
we
shall
not
go
into
the
country
at
all
no
doubt
there
is
a
governor
in
the
town
you
can
give
orders
to
him
to
keep
out
the
and
if
he
can
not
defend
the
place
we
will
land
and
do
it
for
him
we
will
give
orders
to
the
governor
this
finished
the
business
part
of
the
conference
but
the
admiral
was
curious
to
know
the
details
of
what
had
recently
taken
place
at
kiôto
where
it
was
reported
there
had
been
fighting
between
the
chôshiû
and
aidzu
men
thereupon
shiji
told
us
a
long
story
the
gist
of
which
was
that
after
chôshiû
had
received
the
orders
of
both
the
mikado
and
tycoon
for
the
expulsion
of
the
foreigners
and
had
acted
upon
them
to
the
best
of
his
ability
he
got
a
great
deal
of
abuse
for
having
done
so
being
both
surprised
and
hurt
at
this
treatment
he
sent
several
times
to
kiôto
to
inquire
the
reason
but
his
people
were
driven
out
of
the
capital
and
he
was
forbidden
to
present
himself
there
again
he
became
indignant
at
this
injustice
and
his
retainers
sympathized
with
him
very
strongly
at
last
a
band
of
them
who
could
bear
it
no
longer
set
out
for
kiôto
to
demand
an
explanation
from
the
mikado
ministers
they
took
swords
spears
and
other
warlike
weapons
in
their
hands
for
why
on
a
former
occasion
nay
twice
aidzu
had
put
to
death
every
chôshiû
man
to
be
found
in
kiôto
so
said
they
aidzu
may
attack
us
also
and
then
we
must
defend
ourselves
we
will
not
be
killed
for
nothing
the
prince
happening
to
hear
of
their
departure
sent
three
of
his
ministers
to
recall
them
but
they
refused
to
return
then
the
governor
of
kiôto
summoned
chôshiû
agent
at
the
capital
to
send
the
men
home
again
for
if
you
do
said
he
i
shall
attack
them
however
the
agent
refused
and
a
battle
ensued
when
the
barrosa
came
the
first
time
to
himéshima
with
the
letters
of
the
foreign
representatives
the
prince
despatched
his
son
to
communicate
with
the
mikado
but
owing
to
the
disturbed
state
of
affairs
he
was
unable
to
effect
anything
shiji
hoped
we
would
not
believe
that
the
chôshiû
clan
harboured
any
treasonable
intentions
towards
the
mikado
and
the
whole
truth
was
that
they
had
simply
tried
to
get
an
explanation
of
the
manner
in
which
they
had
been
treated
he
added
that
we
ought
not
to
put
any
trust
in
what
was
told
us
by
the
kokura
people
or
the
junk
sailors
who
came
from
yedo
and
hizen
and
all
parts
of
the
country
and
were
enemies
of
chôshiû
our
visitors
were
then
conducted
over
the
ship
and
after
being
entertained
with
some
music
by
the
band
they
went
over
the
side
and
we
parted
on
very
friendly
terms
a
comparison
of
dates
with
the
account
given
in
adams
chapters
and
of
what
had
passed
at
kiôto
during
the
summer
shows
that
the
chôshiû
clansmen
were
marching
from
ozaka
to
kiôto
at
the
very
time
that
itô
and
shiji
landed
from
the
barrosa
and
reached
yamaguchi
to
convey
the
messages
of
the
foreign
representatives
to
the
princes
from
time
to
time
other
bodies
of
chôshiû
men
reached
the
capital
and
the
accumulated
elements
of
civil
war
finally
exploded
on
the
august
before
the
younger
prince
of
chôshiû
who
seems
to
have
really
started
from
home
to
calm
the
excited
spirits
of
the
clansmen
with
news
of
a
new
enemy
in
their
rear
had
time
to
arrive
the
best
fighting
men
were
consequently
absent
when
the
allied
squadron
appeared
at
the
straits
and
our
victory
was
therefore
a
much
easier
affair
than
it
would
otherwise
have
been
i
doubt
whether
any
of
the
fugitives
from
kiôto
got
home
in
time
to
take
part
in
the
defence
of
the
place
next
day
captain
hayes
of
the
tartar
major
wray
and
i
went
ashore
for
a
walk
through
shimonoséki
the
eastern
end
of
the
town
had
received
a
good
many
round
shot
on
the
september
and
some
of
the
houses
were
almost
knocked
to
pieces
i
believe
the
chôshiû
men
had
brought
out
a
field
piece
or
two
and
fired
from
that
point
against
the
squadron
lying
in
front
of
tanoura
this
had
drawn
on
them
our
heavy
artillery
the
townspeople
were
flocking
back
and
had
commenced
to
settle
down
again
but
very
few
shops
were
open
the
common
people
followed
us
in
crowds
and
appeared
very
friendly
but
the
prices
asked
by
the
shopkeepers
were
exorbitant
we
were
somewhat
surprised
though
of
course
without
reason
to
find
that
the
proportion
of
shops
was
very
small
as
compared
with
yokohama
we
saw
several
soldiers
some
armed
with
rifles
others
carrying
swords
and
spears
they
of
course
could
not
be
expected
to
look
very
amicably
at
their
late
foes
on
the
hadano
and
the
two
governors
of
the
town
came
off
to
tell
the
admiral
that
a
market
would
be
opened
at
a
wharf
called
nabéhama
from
ten
to
twelve
in
the
forenoon
for
the
sale
of
fresh
provisions
we
of
course
suspected
them
of
having
made
this
arrangement
in
order
to
have
everything
under
their
own
control
and
to
keep
the
prices
as
high
as
possible
the
admiral
demanded
a
market
from
six
to
eight
to
which
after
much
discussion
they
agreed
i
learnt
through
my
teacher
that
the
people
were
told
to
sell
dearly
to
us
in
spite
of
the
promise
given
to
us
by
the
officials
that
they
would
not
interfere
the
latter
had
begged
that
our
men
might
be
ordered
not
to
purchase
anything
in
the
shops
on
the
ground
that
we
should
buy
up
all
the
provisions
intended
for
the
townsfolk
on
the
captain
dowell
transferred
to
the
euryalus
as
vice
captain
alexander
invalided
next
day
i
accompanied
the
two
admirals
on
shore
to
the
clean
little
village
of
moji
on
asking
some
kokura
men
whom
we
met
to
show
us
the
way
up
to
the
battery
on
the
point
where
the
strait
sweeps
round
they
inquired
whether
we
had
permission
from
the
guard
established
at
a
temple
close
by
the
answer
to
this
astounding
query
was
that
we
were
not
in
the
habit
of
asking
leave
was
that
the
path
yes
that
the
path
so
we
toiled
up
a
hill
through
the
pine
trees
turned
to
the
left
and
descended
into
the
battery
which
was
constructed
for
three
guns
it
commanded
a
view
right
up
and
down
the
straits
from
manshiû
to
hikushima
it
was
a
splendid
position
for
guns
though
a
shell
pitched
in
the
line
of
the
work
would
of
necessity
have
fallen
into
it
unless
passing
very
high
as
it
was
cut
out
of
the
hillside
all
about
it
there
were
places
cleared
for
guns
which
would
have
a
powerful
effect
against
ships
the
thick
brushwood
would
prevent
any
attempt
at
escalade
and
a
single
gun
is
not
easily
hit
i
do
not
know
what
might
be
done
with
modern
artillery
but
it
was
the
opinion
of
all
our
engineer
officers
that
if
the
japanese
of
that
day
had
known
the
advantages
of
the
position
they
could
easily
have
rendered
it
impregnable
at
two
in
the
afternoon
arrived
the
chôshiû
delegates
who
by
agreement
made
earlier
in
the
day
were
to
represent
the
prince
the
story
they
told
us
was
that
he
had
voluntarily
shut
himself
up
in
order
to
await
the
will
of
the
mikado
or
as
they
phrased
it
he
had
placed
himself
in
an
attitude
of
respectful
attention
lest
it
should
be
supposed
that
this
is
merely
a
joke
i
must
explain
that
in
the
old
times
whenever
a
member
of
the
class
had
committed
an
act
in
person
or
vicariously
which
might
be
expected
to
bring
down
upon
him
the
wrath
of
his
political
superiors
he
at
once
assumed
a
submissive
posture
and
as
it
were
delivered
himself
up
tied
hands
and
feet
to
the
pleasure
of
his
lord
it
was
a
sort
of
voluntary
as
a
misdemeanant
we
did
not
accept
the
excuse
which
it
was
natural
to
suppose
had
been
invented
to
save
him
the
trouble
of
travelling
to
shimonoséki
but
i
now
incline
to
think
that
horrorstruck
at
the
violent
proceedings
of
his
followers
who
had
dared
to
fight
against
the
defenders
of
the
palace
and
also
repenting
of
their
failure
the
old
prince
had
hastened
to
atone
for
the
crime
of
treason
as
far
as
lay
in
his
power
by
declaring
his
readiness
to
undergo
any
penalty
that
might
be
decreed
by
the
sovereign
if
his
retainers
would
let
him
being
understood
their
names
were
shishido
bizen
môri
idzumo
shishido
giôma
and
ibara
kazuyé
ministers
and
nawozaki
yahichirô
a
secretary
itô
shunsuké
hadano
kingo
and
another
whose
name
i
did
not
note
down
bizen
it
appeared
had
after
all
not
completely
retired
from
public
affairs
both
the
admirals
were
present
as
soon
as
the
conference
was
formed
admiral
küper
asked
why
they
had
not
let
him
know
earlier
that
the
prince
was
in
seclusion
as
the
truce
had
been
granted
solely
that
there
might
be
time
for
him
to
reach
shimonoséki
they
answered
that
the
boat
was
slow
and
they
had
only
arrived
late
on
the
previous
day
they
had
spent
a
long
time
arguing
with
the
prince
and
using
their
best
efforts
to
persuade
him
to
come
but
he
always
answered
that
it
was
an
old
custom
from
which
he
could
not
depart
he
was
in
disgrace
with
the
mikado
and
was
not
able
to
see
even
his
own
confidential
retainers
much
less
could
he
see
the
admirals
they
regretted
it
very
much
but
it
could
not
be
helped
the
prince
would
have
greatly
liked
to
meet
the
admirals
after
this
question
had
been
so
thoroughly
thrashed
out
that
the
japanese
could
not
but
suppose
that
great
importance
was
attached
to
a
direct
undertaking
on
the
part
of
the
prince
the
admirals
demands
were
announced
as
follows
foreign
vessels
passing
through
the
straits
to
be
treated
in
a
friendly
manner
to
be
permitted
to
purchase
coals
provisions
water
and
other
necessaries
if
driven
in
through
stress
of
weather
the
crews
to
be
permitted
to
land
henceforth
no
new
batteries
to
be
constructed
the
old
ones
not
to
be
repaired
and
no
guns
to
be
mounted
in
them
this
article
caused
some
discussion
for
as
now
put
it
deprived
them
of
a
loophole
that
had
been
left
open
on
the
previous
occasion
but
when
they
were
asked
for
what
purpose
the
batteries
had
been
erected
they
had
but
one
answer
for
making
war
on
foreigners
well
then
those
foreigners
having
destroyed
the
batteries
and
taken
the
guns
will
not
permit
any
more
to
be
put
in
the
same
place
the
article
is
indispensable
and
must
stand
as
it
is
so
they
agreed
to
it
the
town
of
shimonoséki
might
justly
have
been
destroyed
because
it
fired
on
our
ships
but
it
was
left
unhurt
and
therefore
a
ransom
must
be
paid
furthermore
the
prince
must
defray
the
cost
of
the
expedition
the
whole
amount
will
be
determined
by
the
foreign
representatives
at
yedo
to
this
our
friends
offered
strenuous
opposition
chôshiû
and
bôshiû
were
two
very
small
provinces
and
possessed
a
revenue
of
scarcely
of
rice
of
this
went
to
support
the
retainers
the
balance
having
been
spent
in
batteries
guns
and
all
other
manner
of
warlike
equipments
if
the
sum
demanded
were
beyond
their
resources
they
could
not
pay
it
there
were
plenty
of
men
in
the
province
who
cared
nothing
for
their
lives
in
comparison
with
the
fulfilment
of
their
duty
towards
the
prince
it
is
he
who
wishes
to
make
peace
and
he
has
much
difficulty
in
repressing
their
zeal
the
admiral
replied
that
they
should
have
calculated
the
price
beforehand
they
had
chosen
to
make
war
and
now
that
the
bill
was
being
presented
to
them
they
must
pay
it
finally
they
agreed
to
this
article
but
it
struck
me
that
their
object
was
solely
to
let
us
know
that
their
spirit
was
not
entirely
broken
and
that
if
our
demands
were
too
exorbitant
they
would
fight
rather
than
yield
last
of
all
we
inserted
in
the
draft
a
declaration
that
this
was
merely
a
treaty
for
the
temporary
cessation
of
hostilities
and
was
entirely
independent
of
any
questions
connected
with
chôshiû
which
might
have
to
be
settled
later
on
between
the
foreign
representatives
and
the
japanese
government
i
imagine
that
this
clause
had
reference
to
the
indemnities
which
might
be
demanded
on
the
part
of
france
holland
and
the
united
states
at
any
rate
it
was
agreed
to
without
any
discussion
a
fair
copy
was
written
out
to
which
two
of
the
affixed
their
signatures
and
a
couple
of
days
were
given
to
them
to
go
to
yamaguchi
in
order
to
obtain
the
prince
signature
those
who
had
not
previously
seen
the
ship
were
taken
the
usual
round
through
the
lower
deck
and
engine
room
and
they
left
in
a
body
on
the
things
seemed
quiet
enough
for
a
little
private
exploration
on
my
own
account
in
company
with
my
teacher
we
went
first
to
call
on
ibara
kazuyé
one
of
the
envoys
who
had
negotiated
the
agreement
of
the
day
before
and
asked
him
to
come
on
board
to
be
photographed
by
beato
then
while
hayashi
whose
crown
was
by
this
time
black
with
a
fortnight
bristly
growth
went
to
a
barber
shop
to
get
himself
clean
shaved
i
strolled
about
the
streets
alone
and
turned
into
an
where
we
had
agreed
to
meet
the
people
received
me
civilly
and
showed
me
upstairs
to
a
room
one
side
of
which
was
entirely
open
to
the
air
and
overlooked
a
small
courtyard
in
the
next
apartment
were
some
chôshiû
men
leaning
over
the
wooden
balcony
who
waved
their
hands
to
me
to
go
away
but
i
called
out
what
do
you
want
in
a
fierce
tone
and
they
collapsed
immediately
so
great
was
the
prestige
of
our
victory
when
hayashi
joined
me
we
ordered
an
to
be
got
ready
and
while
it
was
being
cooked
devoured
nearly
the
whole
of
a
ripe
water
melon
the
rocksucker
was
cooked
with
sugar
and
proved
terribly
tough
two
sorts
of
were
served
and
the
waiting
maid
smoked
all
the
while
to
perfume
the
room
we
wound
up
with
terrapin
soup
and
rice
during
the
rest
of
my
stay
at
shimonoséki
which
lasted
nearly
a
month
i
was
constantly
on
shore
and
never
had
any
trouble
with
the
townspeople
who
were
always
civil
and
friendly
the
treaty
was
brought
down
on
the
and
found
to
be
duly
signed
and
sealed
at
the
same
time
the
japanese
produced
a
paper
which
they
wanted
the
admirals
to
sign
undertaking
that
the
officers
and
crews
should
keep
within
certain
limits
and
above
all
should
not
land
at
night
there
was
a
good
deal
of
misunderstanding
about
this
document
the
abbé
girard
teacher
maintained
that
it
was
a
memorandum
or
from
the
chôshiû
authorities
and
as
i
was
younger
and
had
not
the
prestige
of
the
abbé
as
a
japanese
scholar
i
had
to
give
way
so
we
concocted
a
letter
in
reply
which
i
wrote
out
and
took
on
shore
to
the
governor
our
letter
said
that
the
principal
restrictions
which
the
japanese
asked
us
to
agree
to
had
been
granted
already
and
that
as
for
the
rest
the
governor
had
on
the
occasion
of
his
last
visit
said
there
were
no
complaints
to
make
of
our
people
trespassing
on
either
guardhouses
or
temples
and
therefore
it
was
unnecessary
for
them
to
make
such
demands
in
future
if
they
had
anything
to
communicate
it
must
be
done
by
letter
signed
and
sealed
by
ibara
kazuyé
on
reading
this
the
governor
to
my
delight
said
here
a
mistake
what
i
brought
to
you
was
a
draft
of
a
letter
for
the
naval
commanders
to
write
to
us
the
object
of
the
naval
operations
in
the
straits
having
been
completely
attained
by
the
destruction
of
the
batteries
and
the
establishment
of
a
good
understanding
with
the
prince
of
chôshiû
preparations
were
now
made
to
withdraw
the
major
portion
of
the
allied
squadrons
leaving
only
three
ships
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
the
passage
being
again
fortified
i
received
orders
to
remain
behind
on
board
the
barrosa
a
day
before
the
admiral
sailed
a
letter
came
from
the
governor
asking
him
to
give
a
passage
as
far
as
yokohama
to
a
and
two
officers
the
request
was
at
once
granted
but
the
three
passengers
not
arriving
in
time
word
was
left
that
they
might
apply
to
the
french
admiral
who
was
to
leave
a
day
later
but
this
they
declined
to
do
having
been
instructed
to
ask
for
a
passage
in
an
english
ship
and
they
would
go
by
no
other
eventually
the
barrosa
took
them
on
the
accordingly
all
the
british
ships
except
the
barrosa
and
all
the
dutch
ships
but
the
djambi
sailed
away
up
the
inland
sea
towards
ozaka
the
french
however
remaining
i
went
ashore
afterwards
with
some
officers
of
the
barrosa
for
a
walk
and
as
we
passed
the
guardhouse
its
occupants
called
out
take
off
your
hats
i
replied
what
do
you
say
the
man
on
guard
take
off
your
hats
this
is
the
honourable
guardhouse
of
shimonoséki
answer
from
our
side
what
folly
do
you
talk
if
you
repeat
it
the
governor
shall
be
informed
so
we
passed
on
into
the
town
to
the
governor
house
and
laid
a
complaint
in
due
form
against
the
guardhouse
keeper
the
governor
promised
to
administer
a
reprimand
and
was
as
good
as
his
word
so
that
when
some
other
officers
came
ashore
and
passed
the
same
spot
the
japanese
officers
rushed
out
into
the
road
to
tell
them
that
they
need
not
uncap
i
found
the
townspeople
very
communicative
about
the
exploits
of
the
americans
and
french
in
and
from
their
relation
it
was
easy
to
see
that
while
captain
of
the
wyoming
had
given
a
very
modest
account
of
his
achievements
in
the
way
of
sinking
ships
and
firing
houses
the
french
had
greatly
exaggerated
their
own
deeds
of
valour
the
wyoming
ran
the
gauntlet
of
all
the
batteries
and
sank
the
lancefield
and
the
brig
right
in
front
of
the
town
whereas
the
sémiramis
never
ventured
further
than
tanoura
the
common
folk
were
all
entirely
convinced
that
the
tycoon
had
given
orders
for
the
expulsion
of
the
foreigners
and
i
overheard
a
man
in
the
market
say
the
is
playing
a
double
game
was
the
most
common
term
by
which
the
tycoon
government
was
then
designated
i
was
asked
whether
the
tycoon
had
asked
us
to
come
down
and
destroy
the
batteries
to
which
i
answered
no
but
he
said
he
could
not
open
the
straits
then
i
gave
them
our
view
of
the
case
which
was
that
the
tycoon
finding
himself
in
a
tight
place
between
the
and
the
foreigners
had
to
give
assurances
to
both
which
were
inconsistent
with
each
other
whereupon
they
all
cried
out
with
one
voice
it
is
true
that
evening
there
arrived
from
nagasaki
the
steamer
victoria
with
the
of
that
port
and
an
interpreter
passing
in
front
of
the
town
they
paid
the
french
admiral
a
call
and
then
anchored
near
us
in
tanoura
bay
coming
on
board
to
make
inquiries
they
asked
whether
chôshiû
had
been
beaten
and
on
our
replying
in
the
affirmative
they
produced
a
copy
of
the
prince
first
letter
begging
for
peace
addressed
to
the
which
they
said
had
been
furnished
to
them
by
the
kokura
people
that
i
told
them
bluntly
must
be
a
lie
but
they
would
not
confess
the
source
from
which
they
had
obtained
the
document
they
said
their
instructions
were
to
ask
the
admiral
not
to
believe
the
lies
chôshiû
was
telling
about
orders
received
from
the
tycoon
to
expel
foreigners
and
also
that
having
heard
the
fleet
was
going
to
ozaka
the
governor
of
nagasaki
who
was
afraid
that
the
appearance
of
so
large
a
force
before
the
city
fresh
from
the
destruction
of
the
batteries
of
shimonoséki
might
cause
a
panic
had
sent
them
to
prevent
any
difficulties
between
the
admiral
and
the
governor
of
ozaka
they
were
very
anxious
lest
a
treaty
had
been
concluded
with
chôshiû
for
the
opening
of
shimonoséki
to
foreign
trade
which
would
have
caused
the
commercial
ruin
of
nagasaki
but
we
declined
to
give
them
any
information
having
beaten
the
chôshiû
people
we
had
come
to
like
and
respect
them
while
a
feeling
of
dislike
began
to
arise
in
our
minds
for
the
tycoon
people
on
account
of
their
weakness
and
and
from
this
time
onwards
i
sympathized
more
and
more
with
the
party
from
whom
the
tycoon
government
had
always
tried
to
keep
us
apart
on
the
the
sémiramis
and
dupleix
quitted
the
straits
leaving
behind
them
the
tancrède
some
of
us
went
ashore
to
the
to
inquire
whether
we
could
obtain
a
supply
of
bullocks
for
the
ship
the
officials
promised
to
do
all
they
could
but
said
it
would
be
difficult
as
they
killed
none
for
themselves
we
also
asked
them
to
change
some
mexican
dollars
into
japanese
money
which
they
promised
to
do
at
the
nagasaki
market
rate
but
it
was
finally
arranged
that
if
we
found
ourselves
in
actual
need
of
coin
they
should
lend
us
a
thousand
to
be
returned
to
their
agent
at
yokohama
they
proved
so
obliging
that
we
could
not
help
regretting
that
in
order
to
gain
their
friendship
it
had
been
necessary
to
come
to
blows
with
them
and
it
is
not
a
little
remarkable
that
neither
the
satsuma
nor
the
chôshiû
men
ever
seemed
to
cherish
any
resentment
against
us
for
what
we
had
done
and
during
the
years
of
disturbance
and
revolution
that
followed
they
were
always
our
most
intimate
allies
that
day
we
walked
the
whole
length
of
the
town
unattended
by
any
guard
and
got
a
glimpse
of
the
china
sea
beyond
the
straits
we
met
however
with
a
little
show
of
insolence
from
a
couple
of
men
who
motioned
us
back
to
our
boats
but
i
discoursed
to
them
in
their
own
tongue
and
they
were
speedily
reduced
to
silence
the
exhibition
of
a
revolver
had
something
to
do
with
the
production
of
this
effect
itô
came
on
board
one
day
with
a
couple
of
men
who
he
said
were
merchants
but
it
was
evident
from
the
respect
he
paid
to
one
of
them
who
wore
two
swords
that
they
belonged
to
the
high
official
class
they
were
conducted
round
the
ship
and
entertained
with
various
liquors
he
declared
that
in
all
the
fighting
they
had
only
seven
or
eight
men
killed
and
about
twice
that
number
wounded
but
one
of
his
companions
told
me
that
the
number
killed
was
nearly
twenty
itô
said
that
trade
could
be
done
at
shimonoséki
in
cotton
wax
and
silk
produced
in
chôshiû
as
well
as
in
all
the
productions
of
the
northern
provinces
and
ozaka
probably
they
might
manufacture
paper
for
the
english
market
the
prince
he
added
was
very
desirous
of
opening
the
port
to
foreign
commerce
but
just
at
present
they
expected
an
invasion
of
the
combined
forces
of
the
tycoon
and
all
the
and
all
their
attention
was
directed
to
their
own
defence
the
two
vessels
sunk
by
the
wyoming
in
had
been
raised
and
sent
round
to
hagi
i
was
surprised
to
learn
that
the
batteries
at
maeda
mura
as
well
as
those
at
kushi
saki
point
were
within
the
territory
of
the
of
chôfu
who
was
however
not
in
so
far
independent
that
he
could
stand
aside
when
the
head
of
the
family
went
to
war
last
year
at
the
time
when
the
dutch
corvette
medusa
was
fired
on
as
she
passed
the
straits
batteries
had
existed
on
the
low
hills
behind
the
town
and
at
two
points
on
the
sea
front
but
the
guns
had
subsequently
been
removed
thence
to
dannoura
and
maeda
mura
their
fate
was
to
fall
into
our
hands
the
small
battery
on
moji
point
within
the
kokura
territory
was
also
the
work
of
the
chôshiû
men
who
had
levelled
land
and
commenced
the
construction
of
barracks
which
were
however
destroyed
by
the
kokura
people
when
the
failure
of
the
prince
kiôto
schemes
drove
him
to
withdraw
within
his
own
boundaries
for
we
went
one
day
in
our
boats
down
to
kokura
with
the
intention
of
landing
there
to
walk
through
the
town
but
after
keeping
us
waiting
an
hour
and
a
half
and
repeatedly
promising
to
open
the
gate
they
finally
refused
to
admit
us
they
did
indeed
open
it
but
only
to
let
out
a
couple
of
fellows
who
told
us
in
the
lowest
of
low
voices
that
kokura
not
being
a
treaty
port
we
could
not
be
allowed
to
enter
i
took
care
to
inform
them
of
our
opinion
that
it
was
a
great
piece
of
ingratitude
on
their
part
to
treat
us
in
so
inhospitable
a
manner
after
we
had
thrashed
their
enemy
for
them
crowds
of
people
had
collected
to
look
at
us
and
doubtless
we
should
have
been
mobbed
if
we
had
landed
there
was
no
idea
on
our
part
of
forcing
our
way
in
towards
the
end
of
the
month
smallpox
broke
out
on
board
and
cummings
who
had
succeeded
to
the
temporary
command
on
captain
transfer
to
the
flagship
determined
to
leave
for
yokohama
as
soon
as
the
necessary
arrangements
could
be
made
on
the
we
applied
therefore
to
the
authorities
for
a
pilot
to
take
the
ship
through
the
inland
sea
and
gave
notice
that
the
commanders
of
the
three
ships
would
pay
a
visit
to
ibara
on
the
morrow
in
order
to
settle
about
the
passage
up
to
yokohama
which
had
been
promised
to
him
and
two
other
officers
i
took
the
message
on
shore
and
stopped
to
have
a
meal
with
itô
who
had
made
great
efforts
to
get
up
a
dinner
in
european
style
he
had
built
a
table
seven
feet
long
by
half
that
width
covered
with
a
short
cloth
of
some
coarse
foreign
material
four
plates
were
laid
flanked
by
long
knives
villainously
sharp
attenuated
brass
spoons
with
flat
bowls
and
a
pair
of
chopsticks
the
first
dish
consisted
of
a
boiled
rockfish
which
i
found
great
difficulty
in
cutting
but
accomplished
the
task
at
last
by
inserting
a
sharpened
chopstick
into
the
head
and
using
a
spoon
to
remove
the
flesh
soy
a
large
bowl
of
rice
and
a
small
saucer
full
of
coarse
salt
were
also
placed
on
the
table
the
second
course
was
broiled
eels
and
then
came
a
stewed
terrapin
both
of
which
were
very
good
but
the
boiled
and
boiled
chicken
which
followed
were
quite
out
of
the
question
it
was
a
problem
how
to
cut
up
a
fowl
with
a
knife
that
had
no
point
and
whose
blade
threatened
at
every
moment
to
part
company
with
its
handle
i
abandoned
the
attempt
and
served
my
companions
with
slices
from
the
breast
unripe
persimmons
peeled
and
cut
in
four
with
sweet
rice
beer
were
now
produced
and
this
was
excellent
this
was
certainly
the
earliest
attempt
ever
made
in
that
part
of
japan
at
giving
a
dinner
in
european
style
perhaps
the
first
in
japan
it
was
finally
determined
that
the
party
that
was
to
visit
yokohama
should
consist
of
ibara
a
councillor
named
sugi
tokusuké
a
secretary
and
itô
with
four
servants
who
were
to
be
accommodated
on
board
the
barrosa
and
djambi
the
tancrède
which
was
to
leave
before
us
could
not
find
room
for
more
than
half
the
party
and
as
they
did
not
wish
to
be
separated
longer
than
they
could
help
they
elected
to
come
with
us
on
the
october
the
racehorse
commander
boxer
arrived
to
relieve
us
ibara
and
his
secretary
yamagata
keizô
and
we
sailed
the
following
morning
news
of
our
successful
result
of
the
naval
operations
and
of
the
conclusion
of
a
convention
with
the
prince
of
chôshiû
was
at
once
conveyed
to
the
foreign
representatives
at
yokohama
who
lost
no
time
in
calling
the
tycoon
government
to
account
for
their
apparent
complicity
with
chôshiû
as
evidenced
by
the
copies
of
orders
from
kiôto
which
itô
had
given
us
the
explanation
was
feeble
and
the
representatives
found
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
from
the
ministers
their
consent
to
pay
whatever
war
indemnity
might
be
due
from
chôshiû
or
else
to
throw
open
to
trade
a
port
in
the
inland
sea
although
in
the
sequel
the
receipt
of
the
indemnity
money
by
us
actually
took
place
it
was
in
a
manner
forced
upon
the
four
powers
and
their
diplomatic
agents
and
certainly
as
far
as
sir
alcock
is
concerned
he
may
be
entirely
exonerated
from
the
accusation
of
a
desire
to
exact
an
indemnity
from
either
the
defeated
or
the
government
which
assumed
responsibility
for
him
the
principal
object
he
sought
was
to
obtain
the
sanction
of
the
mikado
to
the
treaties
so
as
to
put
an
end
to
the
agitation
against
foreign
commerce
which
had
been
carried
on
by
hostile
in
the
name
ever
since
the
opening
of
the
ports
now
that
satsuma
and
chôshiû
the
two
ringleaders
of
the
opposition
had
been
brought
to
their
senses
it
ought
to
have
been
he
thought
an
easy
matter
for
the
government
if
they
sincerely
desired
to
carry
out
their
treaty
obligations
to
assert
their
authority
and
compel
the
whole
country
to
accept
the
new
policy
of
foreign
intercourse
the
fixing
of
an
indemnity
was
intended
only
to
provide
a
means
of
pressure
upon
the
government
in
order
to
procure
the
mikado
ratification
of
the
treaties
and
the
consequent
extension
of
commercial
relations
ibara
and
his
companions
reached
yokohama
on
the
october
and
obtained
an
interview
the
same
day
with
sir
rutherford
alcock
and
pruyn
the
united
states
minister
the
reception
accorded
to
them
was
of
such
a
nature
as
to
convince
them
that
the
foreign
powers
were
not
hostilely
disposed
towards
the
of
chôshiû
and
it
was
no
doubt
with
a
sense
of
relief
that
they
learnt
the
intention
of
the
foreign
representatives
to
claim
the
payment
of
the
indemnity
from
the
tycoon
at
the
same
time
it
was
clearly
understood
by
both
parties
that
the
other
engagements
entered
into
by
chôshiû
respecting
the
permanent
disarmament
of
the
straits
of
shimonoséki
and
the
hospitable
treatment
of
foreign
vessels
were
to
be
faithfully
adhered
to
and
on
these
heads
his
subsequent
conduct
gave
no
ground
for
complaint
it
was
somewhat
a
curious
position
for
the
retainers
of
a
prince
who
had
been
declared
a
rebel
against
the
mikado
and
enemy
of
the
tycoon
to
land
at
yokohama
a
port
belonging
to
the
latter
but
as
far
as
i
remember
they
confined
their
visit
to
the
foreign
settlement
where
they
were
safe
from
interference
and
on
the
the
tartar
left
with
them
on
board
to
return
to
their
native
province
chapter
xii
the
murder
of
bird
and
baldwin
it
was
about
this
time
that
sir
rutherford
alcock
received
lord
russell
despatches
recalling
him
to
england
ostensibly
for
the
purpose
of
consulting
with
him
on
the
situation
of
affairs
this
summons
to
london
was
accompanied
by
the
expression
of
an
opinion
that
the
passage
of
the
inland
sea
was
not
necessary
to
foreign
commerce
which
amounted
to
a
censure
upon
his
conduct
it
is
seldom
that
an
agent
of
the
foreign
office
is
told
in
so
many
words
that
he
is
recalled
because
his
conduct
of
affairs
has
not
given
satisfaction
but
inasmuch
as
leave
of
absence
is
usually
granted
upon
the
application
of
the
ambassador
envoy
or
whatever
the
title
of
the
head
of
a
mission
may
be
an
invitation
to
return
home
is
equivalent
to
the
removal
of
a
diplomatic
officer
from
his
employment
but
arriving
just
at
the
moment
when
his
policy
had
been
successful
in
every
direction
and
when
all
the
foreigners
in
the
country
were
united
in
a
chorus
of
gratitude
to
him
for
his
energetic
action
he
and
all
the
members
of
his
legation
felt
that
the
displeasure
of
lord
john
russell
was
not
a
matter
of
much
moment
the
crushing
defeat
of
chôshiû
by
the
foreign
squadrons
coming
so
immediately
after
the
repulse
of
his
troops
from
the
gates
of
the
palace
at
kiôto
restored
confidence
to
the
tycoon
government
and
enabled
them
to
declare
firmly
to
the
mikado
that
the
idea
of
expelling
foreigners
from
the
country
and
putting
an
end
to
trade
was
utterly
and
entirely
impracticable
while
on
the
other
hand
the
demonstrated
superiority
of
european
methods
of
warfare
had
converted
our
bitterest
and
most
determined
foes
into
fast
friends
the
vindication
of
his
proceedings
was
no
difficult
task
and
the
despatch
in
which
he
justified
the
course
he
had
taken
was
conceived
in
a
style
at
once
calm
and
convincing
it
is
only
fair
to
lord
russell
to
say
that
he
lost
no
time
in
acknowledging
that
his
agent
had
been
in
the
right
and
in
conveying
to
him
the
queen
full
approbation
of
his
conduct
but
this
solatium
to
his
feelings
did
not
reach
yokohama
until
he
was
already
on
his
way
to
england
the
shôgun
government
voluntarily
undertook
to
be
responsible
for
whatever
sum
might
be
fixed
upon
as
the
indemnity
to
be
paid
by
the
prince
of
chôshiû
on
the
october
a
convention
was
signed
by
a
member
of
the
shôgun
second
council
and
the
four
foreign
representatives
by
which
three
millions
of
dollars
were
to
be
paid
in
satisfaction
of
all
claims
or
as
an
alternative
the
opening
of
shimonoséki
or
some
other
port
in
the
inland
sea
if
the
tycoon
preferred
to
offer
it
and
the
powers
were
willing
to
accept
the
division
of
this
sum
of
money
among
the
different
powers
was
reserved
for
adjustment
between
the
four
governments
advantage
was
also
taken
of
the
desire
to
conciliate
foreign
powers
now
manifested
by
the
ministers
to
obtain
the
promise
of
various
improvements
at
yokohama
calculated
to
add
to
the
comfort
and
of
the
foreign
residents
and
sir
rutherford
having
thus
reaped
all
the
fruits
of
his
courage
and
perseverance
was
preparing
to
quit
japan
in
obedience
to
the
instructions
of
lord
russell
when
a
fresh
and
totally
unforeseen
event
occurred
which
for
a
time
delayed
his
departure
after
our
successes
at
shimonoséki
and
the
frank
admission
by
the
tycoon
government
of
the
necessity
of
maintaining
the
treaties
the
confidence
of
foreign
residents
in
the
safety
of
the
neighbourhood
had
so
completely
revived
that
they
no
longer
feared
to
make
excursions
within
the
limits
marked
out
by
the
treaties
but
they
received
a
rude
shock
on
the
night
of
the
november
when
the
governor
of
kanagawa
came
to
winchester
the
british
consul
and
informed
him
that
major
baldwin
and
lieutenant
bird
of
the
xxth
regiment
had
been
barbarously
murdered
at
kamakura
a
resort
some
twelve
miles
from
yokohama
baldwin
was
killed
on
the
spot
but
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
inhabitants
bird
had
lived
for
some
hours
after
he
was
disabled
the
two
officers
had
visited
the
famous
colossal
buddha
and
riding
along
the
road
towards
the
temple
of
hachiman
were
just
about
to
turn
the
corner
into
the
avenue
when
a
couple
of
men
sprang
out
upon
them
with
their
swords
and
inflicted
such
ghastly
wounds
as
brought
them
to
the
ground
almost
unresistingly
the
horror
of
the
foreign
community
can
be
more
easily
imagined
than
described
and
it
was
further
deepened
when
as
the
result
of
the
inquest
it
came
to
be
suspected
that
the
mortal
wound
to
which
bird
had
succumbed
had
been
inflicted
some
hours
after
the
assassins
had
left
the
spot
this
in
the
opinion
of
the
surgeons
was
a
wound
in
the
neck
completely
dividing
the
spinal
cord
between
the
second
and
third
cervical
vertebrae
which
clearly
must
have
been
followed
by
instant
death
now
all
the
evidence
went
to
show
that
the
younger
victim
had
lived
until
ten
in
the
evening
if
so
by
whom
was
this
wound
given
and
with
what
motive
those
who
implicitly
relied
upon
the
report
of
the
regimental
surgeons
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
the
act
of
one
of
the
officials
despatched
to
the
scene
of
the
murder
by
the
governor
as
soon
as
the
news
was
brought
to
him
which
was
no
doubt
some
three
or
four
hours
before
he
himself
went
to
communicate
it
to
winchester
and
the
motive
was
suggested
to
be
a
desire
to
prevent
the
wounded
man
from
giving
such
information
to
his
countrymen
as
might
have
led
to
the
identification
of
the
murderers
but
i
can
not
believe
that
any
japanese
official
or
not
could
ever
have
compassed
such
a
treacherous
deed
i
believe
on
the
contrary
that
the
surgeons
who
dissected
out
the
wound
not
using
sufficient
care
themselves
divided
the
spinal
cord
with
a
probe
or
some
other
instrument
and
that
bird
death
was
caused
in
reality
by
the
loss
of
blood
from
his
numerous
wounds
and
this
was
the
view
taken
by
dr
willis
of
our
legation
and
dr
jenkins
then
established
as
a
general
practitioner
in
yokohama
neither
of
whom
was
invited
to
assist
at
the
the
two
surgeons
having
made
a
hurried
examination
and
enunciated
certain
views
as
to
the
nature
of
bird
wounds
without
foreseeing
the
inferences
that
might
be
drawn
would
naturally
and
probably
with
entire
good
faith
adhere
to
those
views
afterwards
especially
as
it
would
not
appear
to
them
at
all
incredible
that
the
countrymen
of
the
men
who
had
committed
such
a
foul
assassination
should
be
capable
of
a
deed
dastardly
enough
in
itself
but
no
doubt
justifiable
in
the
opinion
of
any
japanese
official
there
are
many
additional
considerations
suggested
by
the
reports
contained
in
the
parliamentary
papers
which
would
corroborate
the
view
here
put
forth
if
i
had
space
to
discuss
them
but
as
this
book
is
intended
to
be
a
record
of
my
own
experiences
and
memories
and
not
a
compilation
from
published
materials
it
is
not
the
place
to
go
into
all
these
particulars
at
length
the
tycoon
government
made
all
the
exertions
in
their
power
to
trace
the
assassins
and
before
a
month
was
over
they
had
arrested
one
of
the
guilty
persons
named
shimidzu
seiji
already
on
the
two
of
his
associates
named
gamaiké
and
inaba
accused
of
combining
with
him
in
a
plot
to
murder
foreigners
and
of
extorting
money
from
a
rich
farmer
had
been
executed
though
they
were
not
actual
accomplices
in
the
kamakura
crime
i
was
present
at
the
execution
of
these
two
men
which
took
place
in
an
enclosure
outside
the
japanese
gaol
in
the
afternoon
of
the
december
there
was
a
large
concourse
of
spectators
both
foreign
and
native
a
little
after
three
a
whisper
ran
round
that
the
condemned
were
being
brought
out
a
door
opened
and
a
man
blindfolded
and
bound
with
cords
was
led
through
the
crowd
he
was
made
to
kneel
down
on
a
rough
mat
placed
in
front
of
a
hole
dug
in
the
ground
to
receive
his
blood
the
attendants
drew
his
clothes
downwards
so
as
to
lay
the
neck
bare
and
with
the
hand
brushed
his
hair
upwards
so
as
to
give
full
play
to
the
sword
the
executioner
secured
a
piece
of
cotton
cloth
round
the
handle
of
his
weapon
and
having
carefully
whetted
the
blade
took
up
a
position
to
the
left
of
his
victim
then
raising
the
sword
high
above
his
head
with
both
hands
let
it
fall
with
a
swoop
that
severed
the
neck
completely
the
head
was
held
up
for
the
inspection
of
the
chief
officer
present
who
simply
remarked
i
have
seen
it
and
it
was
thrown
into
the
hole
the
second
man
being
then
carried
in
the
attendants
seemed
to
have
a
little
trouble
in
getting
him
to
kneel
in
the
proper
position
but
at
last
the
arrangements
were
completed
to
their
satisfaction
the
neck
having
been
bared
as
before
a
fresh
executioner
advanced
took
his
place
at
the
prisoner
left
side
and
raising
the
sword
with
a
flourish
let
it
descend
with
the
same
skill
as
his
predecessor
it
was
a
horrible
sight
to
see
the
attendants
holding
the
headless
corpse
down
to
the
hole
and
kneading
it
so
as
to
make
the
blood
flow
more
readily
into
the
hole
and
i
left
the
spot
in
all
haste
vowing
that
mere
curiosity
should
never
induce
me
to
witness
another
execution
capital
punishment
was
much
commoner
in
japan
in
those
days
than
it
has
been
since
the
promulgation
of
the
present
humane
penal
code
and
included
transfixing
with
spears
many
of
the
foreign
residents
must
have
been
present
at
such
sanguinary
spectacles
merely
impelled
by
curiosity
and
without
the
natural
excuse
of
desiring
to
see
the
sentence
of
the
law
fulfilled
upon
an
offender
against
their
own
blood
the
night
before
sir
rutherford
embarked
for
england
news
was
brought
to
him
of
the
arrest
of
shimidzu
seiji
one
of
the
actual
murderers
of
baldwin
and
bird
owing
to
the
reputed
excellence
of
the
native
detective
police
which
under
a
despotic
government
is
usually
efficient
it
was
believed
by
us
that
the
japanese
government
could
always
have
procured
the
arrest
of
the
assailants
of
foreigners
if
they
had
been
determined
to
do
so
the
names
of
many
of
those
who
were
engaged
in
the
attack
on
our
legation
in
were
as
i
learnt
some
years
afterwards
matter
of
common
notoriety
but
in
the
difficult
political
position
that
the
tycoon
advisers
had
created
for
themselves
they
did
not
dare
to
convict
the
murderer
of
a
foreigner
this
then
was
the
first
instance
of
such
a
crime
being
brought
home
to
its
perpetrators
the
british
minister
had
good
reason
to
feel
gratified
at
this
proof
that
his
policy
had
been
the
right
one
and
it
was
a
very
natural
movement
that
induced
him
to
take
off
his
watch
and
chain
and
throw
them
over
the
neck
of
the
messenger
of
good
tidings
shimidzu
seiji
was
executed
on
the
december
at
ten
in
the
morning
in
the
presence
of
a
detachment
of
the
english
garrison
whatever
doubts
may
have
existed
as
to
the
complicity
of
gamaiké
and
inaba
in
his
designs
against
the
lives
of
the
foreign
residents
there
is
none
as
to
the
fact
that
this
man
was
one
of
the
actual
murderers
of
baldwin
and
bird
i
was
instructed
to
accompany
o
flowers
the
acting
consul
to
the
prison
on
the
preceding
day
to
hear
the
sentence
pronounced
we
waited
some
hours
till
he
arrived
from
yedo
in
custody
of
a
strong
guard
and
he
was
at
once
confronted
with
the
witnesses
who
examined
his
features
in
silence
they
were
then
separately
interrogated
and
one
and
all
recognized
him
the
most
important
witness
being
the
boy
who
had
seen
the
attack
afterwards
we
proceeded
to
another
room
and
questioned
the
prisoner
who
acknowledged
his
guilt
in
the
clearest
manner
possible
he
was
proceeding
to
say
something
more
but
was
ordered
by
the
japanese
officers
to
be
silent
but
the
best
evidence
of
his
identity
was
obtained
by
another
member
of
the
consular
service
who
after
the
murderer
had
been
paraded
round
the
town
preceded
by
a
banner
on
which
his
sentence
was
inscribed
this
was
part
of
his
punishment
accompanied
the
procession
back
to
the
execution
ground
here
fletcher
overheard
him
say
when
i
killed
the
foreigners
i
expected
one
of
them
might
be
a
consul
and
every
one
who
knew
our
colleague
will
acknowledge
that
he
was
a
man
of
the
most
exact
truthfulness
who
was
not
in
the
least
degree
likely
to
make
a
mistake
in
such
a
matter
or
over
anxious
to
believe
that
the
japanese
government
were
in
this
instance
departing
from
the
bad
faith
which
is
the
usual
refuge
of
asiatics
in
a
difficult
position
on
the
morning
of
the
the
garrison
was
marched
over
to
the
execution
ground
and
drawn
up
on
one
side
the
prisoner
was
brought
out
about
ten
the
first
words
he
uttered
were
a
request
for
some
being
again
questioned
he
frankly
acknowledged
his
guilt
i
asked
him
what
it
was
that
he
had
been
prevented
from
saying
to
us
on
the
previous
day
to
which
he
answered
that
if
bird
and
baldwin
had
got
out
of
his
way
he
would
not
have
attacked
them
whether
this
was
true
or
not
i
have
no
means
of
judging
but
it
does
not
accord
with
his
written
deposition
that
it
must
be
recollected
is
not
in
japan
a
simple
record
of
everything
a
prisoner
says
but
is
a
reduction
in
writing
by
an
officer
of
the
court
of
the
final
result
of
all
the
statements
made
by
him
on
the
different
occasions
when
he
was
examined
and
resembles
much
more
the
summing
up
of
the
evidence
on
a
criminal
trial
in
england
by
the
presiding
judge
he
begged
the
japanese
officials
not
to
bandage
his
eyes
and
began
to
chant
a
verse
which
might
be
thus
translated
i
do
not
regret
being
taken
and
put
to
death
for
to
kill
barbarians
is
the
true
spirit
of
a
japanese
as
the
attendants
were
drawing
back
the
clothes
from
his
neck
to
prepare
it
for
the
executioner
stroke
he
bade
them
loosen
his
cords
so
that
they
might
do
it
with
greater
ease
adding
in
after
ages
they
will
say
what
a
fine
fellow
was
shimidzu
seiji
he
also
remarked
i
think
the
sword
that
cut
off
gempachi
head
will
do
for
me
alluding
probably
to
the
thickness
of
his
own
neck
and
begged
that
the
blade
might
be
well
whetted
then
saying
cut
neatly
if
you
please
he
stretched
out
his
neck
for
the
stroke
these
were
the
last
words
he
spoke
but
just
as
the
sword
began
to
descend
he
turned
his
head
to
the
left
as
if
to
address
some
further
observation
to
the
officials
so
that
the
cut
partly
missed
its
purpose
and
the
executioner
had
to
hack
the
head
off
a
most
horrible
sight
simultaneously
with
the
delivery
of
the
first
blow
a
gun
fired
by
the
battery
of
royal
artillery
announced
to
all
that
the
assassin
had
received
the
punishment
of
his
crime
and
we
dispersed
as
quickly
as
possible
the
head
was
taken
to
the
bridge
at
the
northern
entrance
of
yokohama
and
there
exposed
on
a
gibbet
for
three
days
copies
of
the
sentence
were
posted
up
at
totsuka
and
at
the
scene
of
the
murder
and
a
few
days
later
i
accompanied
the
legation
mounted
guard
to
see
that
this
part
of
the
undertaking
given
by
the
japanese
authorities
had
been
duly
performed
we
found
that
they
had
fulfilled
their
promises
to
the
letter
and
thus
ended
one
of
the
most
dramatic
incidents
in
the
whole
of
my
experience
in
the
country
it
was
impossible
not
to
hate
the
assassin
but
nevertheless
looking
at
the
matter
from
a
japanese
point
of
view
i
confess
that
i
could
not
help
regretting
that
a
man
who
was
evidently
of
such
heroic
mould
should
have
been
misguided
enough
to
believe
that
his
country
could
be
helped
by
such
means
but
the
blood
of
the
foreigners
who
fell
under
the
swords
of
japanese
murderers
and
the
lives
which
were
sacrificed
to
avenge
it
bore
fruit
in
later
days
and
fertilised
the
ground
from
which
sprang
the
tree
of
the
national
regeneration
chapter
xiii
ratification
of
the
treaties
by
the
mikado
sir
rutherford
having
quitted
japan
the
conduct
of
affairs
was
assumed
by
winchester
as
chargé
before
long
despatches
reached
us
from
lord
russell
expressing
the
entire
satisfaction
of
the
british
government
with
the
policy
pursued
by
our
late
chief
and
we
heard
that
he
had
been
rewarded
by
promotion
to
the
more
important
post
of
minister
at
peking
he
was
succeeded
by
sir
harry
parkes
who
came
to
us
invested
with
the
prestige
of
a
man
who
had
looked
death
in
the
face
with
no
ordinary
heroism
and
in
the
eyes
of
all
european
residents
in
the
far
east
held
a
higher
position
than
any
officer
of
the
crown
in
those
countries
and
whatever
may
have
been
his
faults
and
shortcomings
especially
towards
the
latter
part
of
his
career
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
england
never
was
represented
by
a
more
devoted
public
servant
and
that
japan
herself
owes
to
his
exertions
a
debt
which
she
can
never
repay
and
has
never
fully
acknowledged
if
he
had
taken
a
different
side
in
the
revolution
of
if
he
had
simply
acted
with
the
majority
of
his
colleagues
almost
insurmountable
difficulties
would
have
been
placed
in
the
way
of
the
mikado
restoration
and
the
civil
war
could
never
have
been
brought
to
so
speedy
a
termination
he
was
an
indefatigable
worker
entirely
absorbed
in
the
duties
of
his
post
untiring
in
his
endeavours
to
obtain
a
correct
view
of
his
surroundings
never
sparing
himself
and
requiring
from
his
subordinates
the
same
zealous
assiduity
of
his
personal
courage
i
had
the
opportunity
afterwards
of
witnessing
one
striking
example
and
brilliant
as
have
been
the
achievements
of
many
of
our
indian
civilians
i
do
not
think
that
his
coolness
and
fortitude
in
the
moment
of
peril
have
ever
been
surpassed
by
any
man
not
bred
to
war
he
was
strict
and
severe
in
service
matters
but
in
his
private
relations
gracious
to
all
those
who
had
occasion
to
seek
his
help
and
a
faithful
friend
to
all
who
won
his
goodwill
unfortunately
i
was
not
one
of
these
and
the
result
was
that
from
the
beginning
we
were
never
friends
down
to
the
very
last
though
he
never
had
reason
to
complain
of
sloth
or
unreadiness
to
take
my
share
of
the
work
and
so
it
came
about
that
before
long
i
became
one
of
his
assistants
and
in
the
end
of
was
finally
transferred
from
the
yokohama
consulate
where
i
had
been
appointed
interpreter
early
in
to
the
legation
the
accomplice
of
shimidzu
seiji
in
the
murder
of
bird
and
baldwin
named
mamiya
hajimé
was
executed
on
the
october
i
went
out
early
with
flowers
in
pouring
rain
to
question
the
prisoner
on
some
points
which
had
to
be
cleared
up
in
connection
with
the
crime
he
was
condemned
to
the
same
punishment
as
his
confederate
and
we
went
out
again
at
one
to
be
present
at
his
decapitation
it
was
a
pouring
wet
day
and
the
dull
leaden
sky
overhead
was
in
keeping
with
the
melancholy
occasion
mamiya
was
a
young
fellow
and
endowed
with
far
less
fortitude
than
shimidzu
and
in
order
to
enable
him
to
face
the
executioner
he
had
been
allowed
to
stupify
himself
with
drink
his
head
was
taken
off
at
a
single
blow
the
usual
doubts
as
to
his
identity
were
expressed
by
the
local
foreign
press
but
for
myself
i
was
convinced
that
he
was
one
of
the
assassins
if
the
tycoon
government
had
substituted
any
other
criminal
for
a
man
whom
they
had
not
succeeded
in
capturing
the
truth
would
have
surely
leaked
out
and
by
this
time
we
had
sources
of
information
which
would
have
enabled
us
speedily
to
detect
any
trick
sir
harry
parkes
reached
yokohama
early
in
july
and
winchester
took
his
departure
for
shanghai
where
he
had
been
appointed
to
be
consul
myburgh
was
transferred
at
the
same
time
from
nagasaki
to
the
yokohama
consulate
in
passing
through
nagasaki
sir
harry
had
already
learnt
from
the
agents
of
some
of
the
that
a
civil
war
was
expected
at
no
distant
date
the
object
of
which
would
be
the
overthrow
of
the
tycoon
he
already
in
september
began
to
speak
to
the
council
of
the
desirability
of
obtaining
the
mikado
ratification
of
the
treaties
but
the
credit
of
the
idea
is
in
reality
due
to
winchester
who
i
did
not
know
it
at
the
time
as
early
as
april
had
suggested
to
the
british
government
that
the
written
adhesion
of
the
mikado
to
the
treaties
and
the
reduction
of
the
import
duties
to
a
uniform
tariff
of
per
cent
might
be
obtained
in
return
for
the
partial
abandonment
of
the
shimonoséki
indemnity
the
ministers
having
stated
they
could
not
continue
to
make
the
quarterly
payments
of
at
a
time
as
had
been
stipulated
in
the
convention
in
fact
sir
rutherford
alcock
had
begun
to
lay
stress
on
the
necessity
of
the
mikado
ratification
of
the
treaties
almost
immediately
after
the
bombardment
of
shimonoséki
this
suggestion
was
approved
by
lord
russell
who
at
once
communicated
it
to
the
governments
of
holland
france
and
the
united
states
and
sent
despatches
to
japan
to
the
same
effect
which
reached
sir
harry
parkes
towards
the
end
of
october
he
lost
no
time
in
consulting
with
his
colleagues
and
in
proposing
that
they
should
proceed
in
a
body
to
ozaka
supported
by
a
considerable
squadron
of
to
negotiate
direct
with
the
main
body
of
the
tycoon
ministers
i
should
have
mentioned
before
that
the
tycoon
was
at
kiôto
having
proceeded
thither
in
the
month
of
june
ostensibly
for
the
purpose
of
taking
command
of
the
army
which
was
to
chastise
the
presumptuous
rebel
the
prince
of
chôshiû
and
was
still
detained
there
by
various
intrigues
and
the
insufficiency
of
his
military
means
the
french
minister
who
was
at
first
strongly
opposed
to
the
abandonment
of
the
indemnity
in
exchange
for
the
opening
of
a
port
had
received
instructions
from
his
government
which
had
induced
him
to
come
over
to
the
views
of
the
british
representative
who
found
the
united
states
chargé
and
netherlands
political
agent
equally
willing
to
follow
his
lead
as
to
the
latter
we
were
accustomed
to
believe
that
sir
harry
had
him
in
his
pocket
as
the
phrase
goes
and
the
americans
had
at
that
time
partially
abandoned
the
affectation
of
acting
on
different
lines
from
the
effete
monarchies
of
europe
unity
of
action
being
thus
secured
the
word
was
passed
to
the
naval
commanders
to
get
ready
for
sea
and
the
legations
having
packed
up
a
sufficient
quantity
of
foolscap
paper
silk
tape
quill
pens
and
bottles
of
ink
embarked
on
board
the
next
day
but
one
after
the
signature
of
a
protocol
in
which
the
four
diplomatic
representatives
had
recorded
their
views
and
projects
sir
harry
took
with
him
john
macdonald
alexander
von
siebold
and
myself
the
squadron
was
an
imposing
one
though
not
so
overwhelmingly
strong
as
that
which
had
destroyed
the
batteries
at
shimonoséki
in
the
previous
year
of
british
ships
there
were
the
princess
royal
flying
the
broad
pennant
of
admiral
st
george
vincent
king
the
leopard
pelorus
and
bouncer
of
french
the
guerrière
dupleix
and
kienchang
while
the
netherlands
contributed
the
corvette
zoutman
our
admiral
was
extremely
and
had
fitted
up
private
cabins
for
us
three
civilians
on
the
main
deck
i
was
delighted
to
find
myself
on
board
with
my
friend
hawes
a
marine
officer
recently
transferred
to
the
flagship
from
the
severn
the
foreign
representatives
it
was
rumoured
proposed
in
addition
to
the
mikado
ratification
of
the
treaties
and
the
reduction
of
the
tariff
to
ask
for
the
opening
of
ozaka
and
hiôgo
to
foreign
trade
on
the
january
by
the
treaty
of
these
places
were
to
have
been
opened
on
the
january
but
the
powers
had
in
agreed
to
a
postponement
of
five
years
in
order
to
give
time
for
things
to
settle
down
in
return
the
four
powers
were
ready
to
forgo
of
the
shimonoséki
indemnity
and
the
option
of
deciding
was
to
be
left
to
the
tycoon
this
much
was
bruited
about
among
the
members
of
the
foreign
legations
outsiders
said
that
we
were
about
to
present
an
and
that
the
creation
of
two
new
centres
of
foreign
trade
was
to
be
demanded
without
alternative
the
men
in
the
service
who
expected
appointments
would
of
course
have
been
eager
to
believe
this
version
but
for
the
glorious
uncertainty
which
surrounds
all
diplomatic
projects
the
yedo
government
were
alarmed
at
the
energetic
step
on
which
the
representatives
had
resolved
and
midzuno
idzumi
no
kami
the
only
member
of
the
first
council
who
had
remained
behind
in
yedo
when
the
tycoon
went
up
to
kiôto
came
down
in
the
company
of
sakai
hida
no
kami
one
of
the
second
council
to
exert
all
his
powers
of
dissuasion
with
sir
harry
it
was
the
first
time
that
a
functionary
of
so
high
a
rank
had
ever
visited
a
foreign
legation
and
the
evidence
of
anxiety
thus
afforded
simply
confirmed
the
resolution
that
had
been
taken
to
bring
matters
to
a
crisis
that
midzuno
and
his
subordinate
hoped
their
efforts
would
be
successful
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
and
in
fact
they
contented
themselves
mainly
with
offering
some
advice
as
to
the
best
method
of
proceeding
on
the
arrival
of
the
representatives
at
hiôgo
we
left
on
the
november
and
proceeding
in
a
leisurely
manner
along
the
coast
passed
the
idzumi
straits
at
on
the
the
guns
were
loaded
and
the
men
beat
to
quarters
but
the
garrison
of
the
forts
at
yura
showed
no
signs
of
molesting
us
and
everybody
soon
quieted
down
again
at
eleven
we
came
in
sight
of
ozaka
lying
on
the
low
land
at
the
mouth
of
the
yodo
river
the
mountains
which
enclose
the
bay
on
either
side
here
appear
to
retire
far
into
the
interior
until
they
disappear
in
the
haze
the
tycoon
castle
was
easily
distinguished
by
its
innumerable
white
towers
rising
at
the
back
of
the
city
but
of
the
town
very
little
was
visible
owing
to
the
slight
elevation
of
the
houses
and
the
distance
from
the
deep
water
outside
where
we
were
passing
the
allied
squadron
formed
in
one
line
headed
by
the
princess
royal
and
gradually
rounded
off
in
the
direction
of
hiôgo
where
we
anchored
at
one
one
by
one
the
other
ships
came
in
and
took
up
the
positions
indicated
to
them
the
bay
was
crowded
with
junks
of
all
sizes
and
we
counted
seven
japanese
steamers
lying
at
anchor
from
one
of
these
belonging
to
the
tycoon
war
department
a
couple
of
officers
came
on
board
to
make
the
usual
inquiries
and
shortly
afterwards
some
very
inquisitive
officials
came
off
who
put
a
great
many
questions
about
the
object
of
our
visit
and
where
we
had
come
from
they
got
very
little
information
in
reply
but
were
told
that
some
officers
would
be
going
by
sea
to
ozaka
on
the
following
day
and
that
notice
should
be
sent
to
the
governor
of
the
city
in
order
that
he
might
despatch
somebody
down
to
the
to
meet
them
they
were
also
requested
to
provide
pilots
for
the
two
vessels
to
be
despatched
to
ozaka
but
they
declared
themselves
unable
to
promise
anything
we
asked
however
as
by
their
own
rules
they
were
under
an
obligation
to
send
information
to
the
governor
this
refusal
was
not
of
any
great
consequence
the
abbé
girard
who
had
acted
as
interpreter
to
admiral
jaurès
the
previous
year
at
shimonoséki
was
on
this
occasion
replaced
by
mermet
de
cachon
a
jesuit
attached
to
the
french
legation
he
with
messrs
macdonald
and
von
siebold
of
our
legation
and
hegt
the
clerk
of
the
netherlands
political
agent
were
despatched
on
the
following
day
in
the
kienchang
to
ozaka
bearing
letters
from
the
foreign
representatives
the
bouncer
was
to
have
taken
our
people
but
her
commander
was
not
able
to
get
up
steam
in
time
so
that
the
french
flag
alone
made
its
appearance
at
the
bar
of
ozaka
first
point
scored
by
the
french
mermet
had
ingeniously
prepared
the
french
letter
in
japanese
inserting
at
the
end
a
long
paragraph
which
did
not
appear
in
the
other
three
letters
empowering
himself
to
state
in
outline
to
the
tycoon
council
the
objects
of
the
foreign
representatives
hoping
thus
to
become
the
spokesman
for
all
four
on
arriving
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
they
were
met
by
the
two
governors
of
the
city
all
officials
were
kept
in
duplicate
in
those
days
who
conducted
them
to
a
building
close
at
hand
evidently
prepared
beforehand
for
their
reception
on
learning
that
mermet
and
his
companions
desired
to
have
a
personal
interview
with
one
of
the
council
the
governors
started
off
immediately
to
fetch
him
as
they
said
promising
that
he
should
be
down
by
four
in
the
meantime
macdonald
siebold
and
hegt
started
off
to
walk
to
ozaka
intending
to
seek
out
the
ministers
there
but
after
wandering
a
long
distance
they
found
themselves
at
three
only
just
in
sight
of
the
city
and
had
to
hurry
back
in
a
boat
the
governors
however
did
more
than
keep
their
promise
and
instead
of
one
produced
two
of
the
council
namely
ogasawara
iki
no
kami
and
abé
bungo
no
kami
the
letters
were
delivered
to
them
and
they
listened
civilly
and
even
affably
to
the
messages
which
mermet
and
macdonald
delivered
but
were
unprepared
of
course
to
give
any
answer
it
was
agreed
however
that
abé
should
proceed
to
hiôgo
on
the
to
meet
the
four
representatives
on
board
the
princess
royal
as
sole
negotiator
on
behalf
of
the
tycoon
who
it
was
stated
had
gone
up
to
kiôto
for
me
had
been
reserved
the
less
glorious
task
of
opening
up
communications
with
the
local
officials
and
in
company
with
captain
jones
i
went
ashore
to
talk
about
beef
water
coals
and
other
ship
requirements
we
also
informed
them
that
the
officers
would
land
and
requested
that
the
townspeople
might
be
ordered
to
treat
them
with
civility
this
they
promised
to
do
but
added
that
their
duty
to
their
chiefs
the
governors
of
ozaka
would
oblige
them
to
detail
one
or
two
constables
to
watch
over
the
safety
of
each
party
after
we
had
conversed
awhile
with
the
head
constable
a
young
man
of
or
some
higher
officials
made
their
appearance
and
assumed
the
power
they
promised
to
do
everything
we
asked
and
to
help
their
memories
made
very
full
notes
in
the
afternoon
accordingly
leave
to
go
ashore
was
given
to
all
the
ships
and
many
of
the
officers
availed
themselves
of
the
opportunity
of
visiting
what
was
then
a
to
most
europeans
the
admiral
sir
harry
and
myself
walked
from
one
end
of
the
town
to
the
other
and
found
the
inhabitants
though
they
followed
us
in
crowds
this
was
a
very
different
reception
from
what
the
tycoon
officers
had
warned
us
to
expect
they
always
talked
to
us
of
the
hostility
of
the
and
the
dislike
and
fear
of
us
entertained
by
the
common
people
but
we
met
with
nothing
but
indications
of
goodwill
from
all
classes
it
became
clearer
to
us
every
day
that
the
shôgunate
feared
lest
free
communication
between
foreigners
and
those
sections
of
the
japanese
people
who
were
outside
its
direct
control
would
impair
the
authority
of
the
institutions
that
had
now
lasted
with
no
small
benefit
to
the
tokugawa
family
for
the
last
years
and
that
consequently
it
could
not
be
a
desirable
policy
for
great
britain
to
endeavour
to
bolster
up
a
decaying
power
as
an
instance
of
the
manner
in
which
the
tycoon
officials
endeavoured
to
obstruct
intercourse
it
may
be
mentioned
that
they
published
a
notification
in
ozaka
forbidding
the
townspeople
to
visit
the
ships
knowing
full
well
that
a
closer
acquaintance
would
make
their
subjects
and
foreigners
better
friends
the
next
few
days
were
spent
in
exploring
the
neighbourhood
with
a
view
to
selecting
a
site
for
a
foreign
settlement
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
running
up
and
down
to
ozaka
by
sea
with
messages
for
the
council
abé
was
not
able
to
come
on
thursday
and
at
first
it
was
held
out
that
another
member
of
the
council
would
replace
him
but
when
the
day
arrived
the
two
governors
of
ozaka
made
their
appearance
with
other
excuses
sir
harry
spoke
very
strongly
to
them
and
insisted
on
seeing
some
one
on
saturday
at
the
latest
but
as
he
did
not
expect
that
his
request
would
be
complied
with
he
despatched
siebold
hegt
and
myself
early
in
the
morning
to
ozaka
on
approaching
the
anchorage
however
we
saw
a
japanese
steamer
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
and
lowering
a
boat
we
went
on
board
we
found
that
she
was
conveying
abé
bungo
no
kami
to
hiôgo
to
see
the
foreign
ministers
it
was
arranged
therefore
that
siebold
should
return
with
him
while
hegt
and
i
went
on
with
a
couple
of
officials
lent
to
us
by
abé
but
as
soon
as
we
anchored
these
men
began
to
be
obstructive
refusing
to
accompany
us
on
shore
until
the
port
officers
had
first
visited
the
ship
seeing
however
that
we
were
determined
to
go
without
them
if
necessary
they
at
last
stepped
over
the
side
into
the
boat
with
a
very
bad
grace
indeed
we
rowed
in
safely
in
the
ship
gig
with
four
bluejackets
over
the
bar
which
a
few
days
before
had
been
rendered
impassable
by
a
strong
west
wind
and
landed
in
a
small
creek
behind
the
battery
at
tempôzan
point
we
at
once
took
possession
of
a
house
where
macdonald
and
siebold
had
lodged
on
their
last
visit
disregarding
the
excuses
of
the
officials
who
said
it
was
occupied
by
a
sick
person
but
we
were
used
to
such
subterfuges
and
of
course
there
was
no
sick
man
there
at
all
after
a
while
we
returned
to
the
gig
and
rowing
up
the
river
in
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
city
where
we
landed
to
inspect
a
house
that
had
been
assigned
for
the
accommodation
of
the
foreign
representatives
the
latter
intended
to
negotiate
in
ozaka
itself
but
this
idea
was
subsequently
abandoned
as
this
one
house
was
evidently
not
large
enough
for
the
representatives
and
their
suites
i
said
i
would
go
to
the
governor
and
ask
him
to
provide
other
accommodation
the
officials
became
alarmed
at
this
and
at
once
offered
to
show
us
another
house
to
which
they
would
take
us
in
a
boat
as
we
wished
to
see
something
of
the
city
i
declined
this
proposal
and
to
their
horror
we
proceeded
to
walk
along
the
bank
a
dense
crowd
of
people
gathered
round
us
but
they
were
very
quiet
and
after
passing
the
the
first
of
the
series
of
bridges
that
span
the
river
right
up
to
the
castle
we
were
shown
a
temple
which
however
proved
to
be
again
insufficient
for
our
needs
it
being
clear
that
our
guides
were
not
animated
by
goodwill
i
again
menaced
them
with
a
visit
to
the
governor
but
here
they
became
utterly
obstinate
and
i
had
to
give
way
so
we
returned
to
our
gig
and
resolving
to
have
a
good
look
at
the
city
got
on
board
and
started
to
row
up
stream
before
long
we
reached
a
barrier
composed
of
native
boats
moored
right
across
from
bank
to
bank
with
the
evident
intention
of
impeding
our
further
progress
some
officials
in
a
guardhouse
on
the
bank
shouted
to
us
to
go
back
but
we
pushed
straight
ashore
and
i
ascended
the
steps
to
demand
the
reason
of
this
obstruction
orders
from
the
governor
was
the
reply
a
somewhat
heated
altercation
ensued
and
i
demanded
that
either
we
should
be
allowed
to
pass
or
that
i
should
at
once
be
conducted
to
the
governor
house
at
last
they
gave
way
and
removed
one
or
two
of
the
junks
leaving
just
enough
space
for
our
gig
taking
one
of
the
guardhouse
officials
on
board
we
proceeded
up
the
river
not
a
little
proud
of
our
victory
over
the
bumbledom
of
a
city
of
people
and
fully
determined
to
go
right
up
to
the
castle
dense
crowds
of
people
collected
on
the
bridges
sometimes
yelling
and
abusing
us
now
and
then
throwing
stones
hegt
began
to
lose
his
temper
and
drawing
his
revolver
threatened
to
fire
but
i
made
him
put
it
back
in
his
pouch
we
were
in
no
danger
and
could
not
afford
to
commit
murder
for
such
a
trifling
reason
at
last
after
grounding
once
or
twice
on
the
sandbanks
we
reached
the
just
below
the
castle
on
our
left
was
a
small
boat
full
of
officials
who
called
to
us
to
come
and
report
ourselves
while
on
the
right
extended
a
grassy
bank
crowded
with
soldiers
dressed
in
costume
among
whom
were
a
few
men
in
plain
dress
apparently
noblemen
retainers
one
of
these
came
down
to
the
edge
close
to
which
we
had
approached
and
shouted
out
to
the
japanese
who
was
with
us
for
his
name
and
office
our
man
replied
who
are
you
and
they
wrangled
for
about
five
minutes
while
we
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
the
straggling
soldiery
but
it
was
clearly
unadvisable
to
land
in
the
midst
of
a
hostile
armed
crowd
and
we
reluctantly
turned
the
head
down
stream
which
now
carried
us
swiftly
along
the
same
crowds
still
occupied
the
bridges
and
shouted
abusive
epithets
as
we
passed
to
the
great
alarm
of
the
japanese
official
who
had
not
got
over
fierce
demeanour
on
the
way
up
and
trembled
for
fear
lest
there
should
be
a
row
landing
the
poor
fellow
whose
tone
had
become
remarkably
fainter
and
humbler
since
he
first
made
our
acquaintance
in
the
morning
we
pulled
out
across
the
bar
to
the
bouncer
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
were
on
our
way
back
to
hiôgo
having
seen
a
good
deal
more
of
ozaka
than
any
one
else
and
braved
the
wrath
of
multitudinous
i
began
to
feel
contempt
for
the
officials
who
so
easily
allowed
themselves
to
be
browbeaten
by
a
few
europeans
a
curious
rencontre
took
place
during
our
stay
at
hiôgo
a
satsuma
steamer
was
lying
in
the
port
and
one
day
the
captain
arigawa
yakurô
came
on
board
the
flagship
with
some
of
his
officers
one
of
them
remembered
having
seen
me
at
kagoshima
and
we
immediately
fraternized
very
heartily
after
drinking
and
smoking
a
good
deal
they
took
leave
promising
to
send
a
boat
for
me
next
day
to
accompany
them
ashore
to
a
japanese
dinner
but
they
forgot
their
promise
the
day
after
my
expedition
to
ozaka
siebold
and
i
went
on
board
arigawa
ship
to
find
him
on
the
point
of
weighing
anchor
he
was
very
glad
to
see
us
abounded
in
apologies
for
being
unable
to
fulfil
his
engagement
to
give
an
and
showed
us
the
cabin
that
had
been
fitted
up
for
the
entertainment
this
gentleman
was
too
civil
by
half
but
still
the
contrast
to
the
offishness
of
the
tycoon
officials
was
very
agreeable
if
i
would
like
to
visit
kagoshima
and
loochoo
he
would
be
glad
to
give
me
a
passage
we
passed
some
time
on
board
eating
raw
eggs
and
drinking
i
rather
think
i
here
met
kawamura
for
the
first
time
a
few
days
later
when
the
steamer
returned
i
again
went
on
board
and
made
an
even
more
interesting
acquaintance
this
was
a
big
burly
man
with
small
sparkling
black
eyes
who
was
lying
down
in
one
of
the
berths
his
name
they
said
was
shimadzu
sachiû
and
i
noticed
that
he
had
the
scar
of
a
sword
cut
on
one
of
his
arms
many
months
afterwards
i
met
him
again
this
time
under
his
real
name
of
saigô
kichinosuké
i
shall
have
more
to
say
of
him
hereafter
abé
bungo
no
kami
had
a
interview
with
sir
harry
on
the
after
which
he
went
on
board
the
guerrière
to
see
roches
the
french
envoy
i
learnt
from
siebold
that
the
conversation
had
not
been
of
a
satisfactory
character
his
answer
to
the
three
propositions
of
the
representatives
amounted
to
a
the
tycoon
would
pay
up
the
second
instalment
of
the
indemnity
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
incurring
unpopularity
by
giving
way
to
our
demands
the
popular
mind
very
unsettled
was
the
excuse
then
and
for
many
a
day
after
sir
harry
had
given
abé
a
piece
of
his
mind
and
said
he
had
better
return
to
his
colleagues
and
get
them
to
reconsider
their
answer
on
the
he
was
to
have
come
down
again
but
feigning
indisposition
as
an
excuse
this
is
in
japan
under
the
name
of
official
sickness
he
sent
a
member
of
the
second
council
tachibana
idzumo
no
kami
to
inform
the
representatives
that
the
tycoon
had
hitherto
never
spoken
to
the
mikado
about
acknowledging
the
treaties
but
that
now
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
do
so
but
he
required
a
delay
of
fifteen
days
for
this
purpose
the
ministers
up
to
this
moment
had
believed
on
the
faith
of
assurances
given
by
the
tycoon
council
in
after
the
shimonoséki
business
that
the
mikado
had
long
ago
been
approached
on
this
subject
and
that
abé
himself
had
been
entrusted
with
a
mission
to
kiôto
to
that
effect
they
were
therefore
naturally
both
surprised
and
incensed
but
consented
to
a
delay
of
ten
days
the
prospects
of
the
negotiation
looked
very
dark
indeed
the
tycoon
seemed
either
unable
or
unwilling
to
obtain
the
mikado
sanction
to
the
treaties
and
it
began
to
be
thought
that
we
should
have
to
throw
him
over
entirely
if
the
tycoon
was
controlled
by
a
superior
authority
he
was
clearly
not
the
proper
person
for
foreign
powers
to
deal
with
who
must
insist
upon
direct
communication
with
the
authority
for
the
present
however
it
was
too
early
to
talk
of
going
to
see
the
mikado
against
his
will
we
had
not
sufficient
men
in
the
allied
squadrons
to
force
a
way
up
to
kiôto
and
even
if
we
had
sir
harry
instructions
would
not
have
enabled
him
to
take
such
a
step
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
wait
an
interesting
visit
was
that
of
some
retainers
of
aidzu
and
hosokawa
who
came
on
board
privately
to
talk
politics
and
to
pick
up
what
information
they
could
for
their
own
princes
the
former
was
the
commander
of
the
tycoon
garrison
in
kiôto
the
latter
one
of
the
more
important
in
the
island
of
kiûshiû
nominally
a
partizan
of
the
tycoon
but
already
beginning
to
consider
whether
it
would
not
suit
him
better
to
go
over
to
the
other
party
for
by
this
time
a
definite
issue
had
been
raised
between
the
tycoon
and
the
court
of
the
mikado
the
former
being
the
friend
of
foreigners
and
an
usurping
vassal
the
war
cry
of
the
latter
was
serve
the
sovereign
and
expel
the
barbarians
my
visitors
talked
a
great
deal
about
the
unsettled
state
of
popular
feeling
they
said
the
mikado
had
already
given
his
sanction
to
the
treaties
in
a
general
sort
of
way
and
had
consented
to
nagasaki
hakodaté
and
shimoda
being
opened
to
foreign
trade
but
kanagawa
had
been
substituted
for
the
latter
port
without
his
approval
they
felt
quite
certain
that
the
mikado
would
not
agree
at
present
to
the
establishment
of
foreign
merchants
at
hiôgo
they
maintained
that
the
feeling
was
pretty
general
among
the
people
but
admitted
that
chôshiû
made
use
of
it
as
a
mere
party
cry
with
the
object
of
dispossessing
the
tycoon
of
his
power
after
an
interval
of
five
days
tachibana
paid
sir
harry
another
visit
he
reported
that
the
tycoon
had
not
yet
started
for
kiôto
to
obtain
the
mikado
ratification
of
the
treaties
being
detained
at
ozaka
by
a
headache
abé
and
ogasawara
were
afflicted
with
indisposition
which
prevented
their
having
the
pleasure
of
coming
down
to
call
on
the
british
minister
sir
harry
administered
some
to
the
unfortunate
prevaricator
and
demonstrated
very
clearly
to
him
that
as
the
council
acknowledged
the
inability
of
the
tycoon
to
carry
out
the
treaty
stipulations
in
respect
of
the
opening
of
new
ports
without
the
mikado
consent
which
they
had
little
hope
of
obtaining
and
still
less
desire
to
get
they
must
eventually
go
to
the
wall
and
the
foreign
powers
would
be
compelled
to
make
a
demand
for
the
ratification
direct
on
the
mikado
it
was
pitiable
to
see
the
shifts
that
the
officials
were
put
to
in
face
of
his
merciless
logic
they
were
perpetually
being
driven
into
a
corner
and
left
without
a
leg
to
stand
on
the
demands
presented
by
the
foreign
representatives
had
created
a
considerable
movement
at
kiôto
and
dissension
followed
among
the
advisers
of
the
tycoon
in
a
few
days
we
heard
that
abé
and
matsumai
idzu
no
kami
had
been
dismissed
from
office
they
were
believed
to
be
in
favour
of
accepting
our
demands
and
their
disgrace
seemed
to
threaten
the
failure
of
the
negotiations
the
representatives
thereupon
resolved
on
the
important
step
of
addressing
a
to
the
tycoon
himself
containing
a
repetition
of
the
demands
already
made
and
warning
him
that
if
an
answer
were
not
made
within
the
period
of
ten
days
originally
fixed
it
would
be
assumed
by
them
that
their
propositions
were
refused
mermet
and
i
went
ashore
together
to
deliver
the
letters
of
our
respective
chiefs
and
i
learnt
that
the
indefatigable
little
man
had
translated
the
french
copy
into
japanese
and
induced
his
minister
to
sign
the
translation
he
had
also
addressed
it
to
the
council
instead
of
to
the
tycoon
though
he
told
me
otherwise
on
our
arrival
at
the
governor
house
he
wrapped
it
in
a
sheet
of
japanese
paper
in
order
that
i
might
not
see
the
address
but
the
officials
who
received
the
notes
of
whom
i
afterwards
inquired
voluntarily
assured
me
that
it
was
addressed
to
the
council
at
ozaka
what
mermet
object
can
have
been
i
was
not
able
to
conjecture
and
it
is
probable
that
he
did
it
merely
to
keep
his
hand
in
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
for
an
habitual
intriguer
to
get
out
of
practice
by
acting
straightforwardly
even
in
unimportant
matters
we
learnt
that
the
tycoon
had
presented
a
memorial
to
the
mikado
urging
him
to
ratify
the
treaties
as
well
for
his
own
sake
as
for
that
of
the
nation
in
general
that
on
its
being
refused
he
had
resolved
to
return
to
yedo
but
was
stopped
by
an
order
from
the
court
before
he
had
got
to
ozaka
the
dismissal
of
the
members
of
the
council
seemed
to
forebode
resistance
and
the
probable
outbreak
of
hostilities
japanese
steamers
lying
at
ozaka
got
up
steam
and
went
off
in
every
direction
some
passing
through
hiôgo
on
their
way
siebold
and
i
pulled
on
board
one
of
these
which
belonged
to
satsuma
and
learnt
that
she
was
going
off
to
yura
in
kishiû
in
order
to
be
out
of
the
way
in
case
the
mikado
should
issue
such
orders
to
the
tycoon
as
might
result
in
measures
being
taken
by
the
allied
squadron
on
the
the
last
day
notice
was
given
to
the
governor
of
hiôgo
that
the
ships
would
move
on
the
morrow
to
ozaka
to
await
there
the
answer
of
the
government
from
him
we
learnt
that
ogasawara
would
surely
be
down
next
day
with
the
reply
but
as
had
already
happened
so
often
in
the
course
of
these
negotiations
he
was
ill
and
matsudaira
hôki
no
kami
took
his
place
the
interview
with
the
foreign
representatives
lasted
several
hours
but
the
gist
of
it
was
that
the
tycoon
had
at
last
obtained
the
mikado
consent
to
the
treaties
by
his
own
urgent
representations
backed
by
those
of
his
cousin
shitotsubashi
who
declared
so
it
was
said
that
he
would
perform
disembowelment
unless
the
mikado
yielded
at
last
the
latter
gave
way
saying
well
speak
to
the
nobles
of
my
court
about
it
the
opening
of
hiôgo
was
however
to
be
still
deferred
until
january
but
the
tariff
would
be
revised
and
the
remaining
instalments
of
the
indemnity
paid
punctually
thus
the
foreign
representatives
had
obtained
two
out
of
the
three
conditions
and
those
the
most
important
while
giving
up
nothing
in
return
it
must
however
be
acknowledged
that
the
payment
of
the
indemnity
was
never
completed
by
the
tycoon
and
survived
the
revolution
to
be
a
constant
source
of
irritation
and
between
the
mikado
government
and
the
british
minister
hôki
no
kami
on
leaving
the
princess
royal
promised
that
a
note
embodying
these
arrangements
should
be
sent
off
in
the
course
of
the
evening
but
as
it
had
to
be
sent
up
to
ozaka
to
receive
the
signatures
of
his
two
remaining
colleagues
the
document
did
not
reach
us
before
two
in
the
morning
i
sat
up
till
that
hour
in
expectation
of
its
arrival
and
was
called
into
the
cabin
to
read
it
to
sir
harry
and
roches
and
then
make
a
translation
the
mikado
decree
to
his
vizier
the
kwambaku
delegating
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
to
the
tycoon
a
short
document
of
only
three
lines
was
enclosed
in
it
at
sir
harry
request
hôki
no
kami
added
an
engagement
to
promulgate
the
decree
throughout
the
country
it
was
a
proud
night
for
me
when
i
displayed
my
knowledge
of
written
japanese
in
the
presence
of
the
french
minister
whose
interpreter
mermet
even
could
not
read
a
document
without
the
assistance
of
his
teacher
thus
successfully
ended
the
negotiations
which
up
to
the
day
before
showed
no
signs
of
fruit
the
foreign
representatives
had
to
congratulate
themselves
on
having
secured
the
means
of
tranquillizing
the
country
while
at
the
same
time
consolidating
the
relations
between
the
japanese
people
and
foreign
nations
the
opening
of
hiôgo
on
the
january
was
a
concession
which
few
people
had
been
sanguine
enough
to
expect
but
something
had
been
secured
which
was
of
more
immediate
value
namely
the
solemn
reiterated
promise
of
the
council
to
adhere
to
the
london
agreement
of
it
was
hoped
also
on
good
grounds
that
sir
rutherford
convention
of
the
previous
october
would
also
be
carried
out
in
its
entirety
at
dinner
the
following
evening
the
admiral
made
a
speech
proposing
sir
harry
health
and
giving
to
him
the
whole
credit
of
the
success
achieved
he
replied
by
disclaiming
any
merit
and
attributing
a
far
greater
share
of
the
achievement
to
roches
but
after
all
he
added
it
was
you
who
did
it
admiral
for
without
you
and
your
magnificent
ship
we
should
not
have
made
the
slightest
impression
on
our
return
to
yokohama
we
found
that
the
wildest
rumours
had
been
flying
about
the
united
states
chargé
portman
was
said
to
have
been
killed
and
sir
harry
taken
prisoner
while
siebold
and
myself
were
also
reported
to
have
fallen
martyrs
to
the
cause
the
japan
times
a
newspaper
conducted
by
charles
rickerby
affected
to
the
whole
affair
and
denied
the
authenticity
of
the
mikado
decree
which
he
said
ought
to
have
been
covered
with
seals
i
wrote
a
letter
to
his
paper
controverting
his
arguments
but
without
convincing
him
there
was
one
point
about
it
however
that
escaped
notice
at
the
time
namely
that
the
existing
treaties
were
not
explicitly
sanctioned
all
that
the
mikado
had
given
was
a
general
authority
to
conclude
treaties
with
foreign
countries
and
he
had
added
a
rider
enjoining
on
the
tycoon
the
cancellation
of
the
undertaking
to
open
hiôgo
and
ozaka
to
trade
this
however
was
carefully
concealed
from
the
foreign
representatives
and
we
only
came
to
know
of
it
later
but
without
seeing
it
no
one
could
have
guessed
that
the
document
represented
to
the
foreign
ministers
to
be
the
mikado
sanction
to
the
existing
treaties
had
not
that
meaning
because
of
the
absence
of
the
definite
article
in
japanese
in
english
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
whether
you
say
the
treaties
are
sanctioned
or
simply
treaties
are
sanctioned
but
in
japanese
the
same
form
of
expression
does
for
both
and
we
had
no
ground
for
suspecting
the
tycoon
ministers
of
taking
refuge
in
an
ambiguity
in
order
to
play
a
trick
on
us
and
to
gain
time

in
pursuance
of
instructions
from
the
chief
i
proceeded
to
yedo
the
day
after
my
return
to
find
out
if
possible
what
had
been
the
popular
feeling
about
our
doings
at
hiôgo
but
did
not
succeed
in
discovering
anything
of
importance
a
general
curiosity
prevailed
and
the
result
of
the
negotiations
was
yet
unknown
a
meeting
of
the
agents
had
been
held
on
the
receipt
of
the
news
that
two
of
the
council
had
been
dismissed
and
it
was
rumoured
that
the
tycoon
had
asked
to
be
allowed
to
retire
but
that
his
petition
had
been
rejected
i
stopped
at
the
monastery
of
which
had
been
temporarily
lent
to
sir
harry
for
a
residence
it
was
in
a
convenient
position
nearer
to
the
centre
of
the
city
than
our
former
location
at
but
the
rooms
were
dark
and
scarcely
numerous
enough
for
the
accommodation
of
the
staff
in
addition
to
the
minister
and
his
family
a
new
building
had
therefore
been
already
commenced
in
front
of
about
between
the
two
and
instead
of
being
called

was
to
be

order
to
avoid

of
its

the

offended
at
not
having

consulted
on
this

to

in
great
dudgeon
is
a
monastery
containing
the
tombs
and
effigies
of
the
celebrated
faithful
retainers
after
a
couple
of
days
stay
at
the
capital
i
returned
to
my
duties
at
the
consulate
in
yokohama
where
i
now
held
the
post
of
interpreter
i
was
beginning
to
become
known
among
the
japanese
as
a
foreigner
who
could
speak
their
language
correctly
and
my
circle
of
acquaintance
rapidly
extended
men
used
to
come
down
from
yedo
on
purpose
to
talk
to
me
moved
as
much
by
mere
curiosity
as
by
a
desire
to
find
out
what
foreign
policy
towards
their
country
was
likely
to
be
owing
to
my
name
being
a
common
japanese
surname
it
was
easily
passed
on
from
one
to
another
and
i
was
talked
about
by
people
whom
i
had
never
met
the
men
were
always
happy
to
get
a
glass
of
wine
or
liqueur
and
a
foreign
cigar
and
they
were
fond
of
discussion
they
would
sit
for
hours
if
the
subject
interested
them
politics
afforded
the
principal
material
of
our
debates
which
sometimes
became
rather
warm
i
used
to
attack
the
abuses
of
the
existing
régime
and
then
explain
that
i
liked
them
very
much
but
hated
despotic
institutions
many
of
the
men
who
visited
me
were
retainers
of
from
whom
i
gained
every
day
a
firmer
conviction
that
the
tycoon
ought
not
to
be
regarded
by
foreigners
as
the
sovereign
of
the
country
and
that
sooner
or
later
we
must
enter
into
direct
relations
with
the
mikado
and
the
state
papers
of
which
copies
came
into
my
hands
through
these
men
proved
that
the
tycoon
regarded
himself
as
nothing
more
than
the
mikado
principal
vassal
at
the
same
time
the
tycoon
ministers
still
persevered
in
their
endeavour
to
keep
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
in
their
own
hands
and
had
succeeded
in
persuading
winchester
that
this
was
an
ancient
and
indefeasible
prerogative
of
the
tokugawa
family
sir
harry
parkes
however
from
the
first
with
clearer
insight
held
that
this
was
untenable
and
resolved
to
press
matters
to
a
definite
solution
which
should
bring
the
sovereign
face
to
face
with
foreign
powers
sir
harry
had
gone
over
to
shanghai
to
meet
lady
parkes
and
his
children
and
immediately
after
his
return
set
to
work
at
the
revision
of
the
tariff
on
the
basis
agreed
to
at
hiôgo
the
negotiations
which
began
about
january
took
much
less
time
than
is
usual
in
these
days
and
the
new
convention
was
signed
in
june
i
had
little
to
do
with
it
beyond
assisting
in
its
translation
into
japanese
in
february
he
began
to
make
use
of
me
as
a
translator
in
addition
to
my
work
at
the
consulate
my
salary
as
interpreter
at
the
yokohama
consulate
which
i
had
joined
in
april
was
only
a
year
and
after
the
hiôgo
business
where
i
had
demonstrated
my
knowledge
of
the
japanese
language
i
began
to
think
my
services
worth
quite
as
much
as
those
of
the
dutch
interpreters
who
received
at
an
interview
with
the
japanese
ministers
they
used
to
translate
into
dutch
what
the
minister
said
and
the
native
dutch
interpreters
translated
this
again
into
japanese
the
reply
had
in
the
same
way
to
go
through
two
men
but
when
siebold
or
i
interpreted
the
work
was
performed
much
more
quickly
and
accurately
because
we
translated
direct
into
japanese
it
was
the
same
with
the
official
correspondence
for
i
was
able
with
the
assistance
of
a
native
writer
and
sometimes
without
to
put
an
official
note
directly
into
japanese
then
i
was
able
to
read
and
translate
into
english
all
sorts
of
confidential
political
papers
which
the
dutch
interpreters
could
make
nothing
of
we
took
a
bold
resolution
and
in
august
sir
harry
having
given
me
a
quantity
of
political
documents
to
translate
we
addressed
letters
to
him
asking
that
he
would
recommend
us
to
the
foreign
office
for
an
additional
a
year
this
brought
down
his
wrath
upon
our
heads
and
i
became
convinced
that
my
application
would
be
refused
under
these
circumstances
i
wrote
to
my
father
that
the
service
was
not
worth
remaining
in
at
that
time
the
telegraph
reached
only
to
ceylon
but
in
as
short
a
time
as
possible
i
received
a
telegram
from
him
telling
me
to
come
home
at
once
and
that
i
should
have
an
allowance
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
go
to
the
university
and
afterwards
to
the
bar
armed
with
this
i
approached
sir
harry
again
and
asked
him
to
accept
my
resignation
i
had
received
a
telegram
from
home
which
necessitated
my
immediate
return
to
england
after
a
little
humming
and
hawing
he
finally
produced
from
a
drawer
a
despatch
from
lord
clarendon
which
had
been
lying
there
for
several
days
granting
the
applications
of
both
siebold
and
myself
and
i
consequently
abandoned
my
intention
of
quitting
the
service
about
march
a
review
and
sham
fight
were
held
of
the
english
garrison
in
combination
with
the
japanese
drilled
troops
commanded
by
kubota
sentarô
on
the
dry
rice
fields
between
and
hommoku
the
enemy
was
entirely
imaginary
his
place
being
taken
by
a
crowd
of
spectators
the
marching
of
the
japanese
was
very
good
and
received
all
the
greater
praise
because
they
had
received
no
practical
instruction
their
officers
had
got
it
up
from
books
the
difficult
passages
being
explained
to
them
by
ours
the
english
soldiers
looked
magnificent
by
the
side
of
the
rather
dwarfish
japanese
the
bluejackets
from
the
fleet
were
very
amusing
one
or
two
got
drunk
and
danced
a
hornpipe
in
the
face
of
the
supposed
enemy
to
the
great
wrath
and
disgust
of
their
commander
a
young
lieutenant
there
was
the
usual
amount
of
firing
with
blank
cartridge
which
when
it
comes
from
one
side
only
renders
every
one
so
plucky
and
desirous
of
charging
the
foe
it
was
a
wonder
that
no
ramrods
were
fired
away
nor
was
any
one
hit
by
a
wad
the
day
was
universally
voted
a
great
success
the
regiment
was
despatched
to
hongkong
about
march
and
replaced
by
the
the
danger
to
foreigners
had
so
much
abated
since
the
execution
of
the
murderers
of
bird
and
baldwin
and
the
ratification
of
the
treaties
by
the
mikado
that
we
began
freely
to
make
excursions
into
the
surrounding
country
on
one
occasion
i
went
away
for
a
few
days
with
charles
rickerby
of
the
japan
times
and
having
thus
become
intimate
with
him
was
permitted
to
try
my
inexperienced
pen
in
the
columns
of
his
paper
my
first
attempt
was
an
article
upon
travelling
in
japan
but
before
long
an
incident
occurred
which
tempted
me
to
write
on
politics
it
was
doubtless
very
irregular
very
wrong
and
altogether
contrary
to
the
rules
of
the
service
but
i
thought
little
of
that
a
satsuma
trading
steamer
had
come
into
the
bay
and
was
ordered
by
the
authorities
to
anchor
far
away
on
the
kanagawa
side
so
that
there
might
be
no
communication
between
the
foreign
community
and
the
people
on
board
taking
this
for
my
text
i
descanted
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
treaties
concluded
with
the
tycoon
which
confined
us
to
commercial
intercourse
with
the
inhabitants
of
his
dominions
and
thus
cut
us
off
from
relations
with
a
good
half
of
the
country
i
called
therefore
for
a
revision
of
the
treaties
and
for
a
remodelling
of
the
constitution
of
the
japanese
government
my
proposal
was
that
the
tycoon
should
descend
to
his
proper
position
as
a
great
territorial
noble
and
that
a
confederation
of
daimiôs
under
the
headship
of
the
mikado
should
take
his
place
as
the
ruling
power
and
then
i
proceeded
to
make
various
suggestions
for
the
improvement
and
modification
of
the
existing
treaties
with
the
aid
of
my
teacher
numata
torasaburô
a
retainer
of
the
prince
of
awa
who
knew
some
english
i
put
them
into
japanese
in
the
form
of
a
pamphlet
for
the
perusal
of
his
prince
but
copies
got
into
circulation
and
in
the
following
year
i
found
myself
to
be
favourably
known
through
this
means
to
all
the
retainers
whom
i
met
in
the
course
of
my
journeys
in
the
end
the
translation
was
printed
and
sold
in
all
the
bookshops
at
ozaka
and
kiôto
under
the
title
of
english
policy
by
the
englishman
satow
and
was
assumed
by
both
parties
to
represent
the
views
of
the
british
legation
with
this
of
course
i
had
nothing
to
do
as
far
as
i
know
it
never
came
to
the
ears
of
my
chief
but
it
may
fairly
be
supposed
to
have
been
not
without
its
influence
upon
the
relations
between
the
english
legation
and
the
new
government
afterwards
established
in
the
beginning
of
at
the
same
time
it
doubtless
rendered
us
more
or
less
suspect
to
the
tycoon
government
while
the
latter
lasted
during
sir
harry
absence
in
july
on
a
visit
to
the
of
satsuma
and
uwajima
after
the
signature
of
the
tariff
convention
some
of
us
at
the
legation
made
up
a
party
with
three
or
four
officers
of
the
ix
regiment
and
went
for
a
trip
to
hachiôji
and
atsugi
in
those
days
all
the
high
roads
were
intersected
at
certain
points
by
strictly
guarded
barriers
where
all
travellers
had
to
show
their
passports
beyond
hachiôji
a
few
miles
to
the
west
was
one
of
these
just
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
known
as
about
feet
high
with
a
good
road
to
the
top
up
this
we
rode
on
our
ponies
and
after
lunching
under
the
shade
of
the
lofty
cryptomerias
descended
to
the
high
road
again
but
unintentionally
reached
it
beyond
the
barrier
the
guards
who
were
inclined
to
interpret
their
duties
rather
too
strictly
than
otherwise
shut
the
gates
and
refused
to
let
us
pass
it
was
in
vain
that
we
explained
our
mistake
they
had
orders
not
to
let
foreigners
through
one
would
have
thought
that
as
we
were
on
the
side
where
we
had
no
business
to
be
and
were
desirous
of
getting
back
to
the
right
side
the
officers
in
command
would
have
facilitated
our
wishes
to
repair
our
error
but
nothing
would
move
them
at
last
willis
who
stood
feet
inches
in
his
stockings
and
weighed
then
about
stone
made
as
if
he
would
charge
the
gate
on
his
pony
and
seriously
alarmed
lest
he
should
batter
the
whole
thing
down
in
a
rush
they
prudently
flung
it
open
and
we
rode
through
triumphantly
a
similar
incident
occurred
on
another
occasion
when
i
was
out
with
francis
myburgh
captain
jones
of
the
flagship
and
charles
wirgman
the
limit
of
excursions
from
yokohama
in
the
direction
of
the
capital
was
formed
by
the
which
in
the
treaties
is
called
the
logo
river
a
corruption
of
rokugô
we
had
slept
at
mizoguchi
and
ascended
the
right
bank
on
horseback
to
sekido
where
without
difficulty
we
induced
the
ferryman
to
put
us
across
and
rode
into
the
town
of
fuchiû
to
visit
a
shintô
temple
we
were
bound
for
a
monastery
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
where
we
had
planned
to
spend
the
night
and
to
do
this
it
was
necessary
to
recross
further
up
to
the
buddhist
monastery
of
but
on
arriving
there
and
shouting
to
the
ferryman
we
got
a
blank
refusal
accompanied
by
the
information
that
we
had
no
business
to
be
where
we
were
we
know
that
we
are
and
want
to
get
back
where
we
ought
to
be
ca
help
that
our
orders
are
not
to
ferry
any
foreigner
over
it
was
impossible
to
convince
him
that
though
he
would
be
right
in
refusing
to
facilitate
a
breach
of
the
law
he
was
bound
to
assist
the
repentant
and
contrite
offenders
in
repairing
such
a
breach
and
we
saw
ourselves
menaced
with
separation
from
our
baggage
and
perhaps
a
cold
night
on
the
stones
just
above
the
ferry
was
a
shallower
spot
too
deep
to
cross
on
ponies
without
getting
rather
wet
charles
wirgman
and
i
therefore
took
off
our
trousers
and
tucking
our
shirts
up
as
high
as
possible
waded
to
the
other
bank
walked
down
to
the
ferry
house
jumped
into
the
boat
before
the
ferrymen
had
time
to
recover
from
their
surprise
at
our
audacity
poled
it
across
to
our
friends
amid
cries
of
wa
about
equivalent
to
robbery
and
murder
from
the
guardians
of
the
posts
and
so
got
the
whole
party
across
on
the
of
november
occurred
one
of
the
most
destructive
fires
with
which
yokohama
has
ever
been
visited
one
fourth
of
the
foreign
settlement
and
of
the
native
town
were
laid
in
ashes
the
began
to
ring
about
nine
in
the
morning
willis
and
i
ascended
to
the
on
the
roof
of
our
house
and
saw
the
flames
mounting
to
the
sky
exactly
to
windward
of
us
maybe
half
a
mile
away
i
rushed
into
a
pair
of
boots
unluckily
my
oldest
and
putting
on
my
hat
hastened
forth
to
find
out
the
location
of
the
fire
my
servants
said
it
was
only
a
few
doors
off
but
when
i
got
that
distance
it
proved
to
be
further
away
and
i
pursued
my
course
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
arriving
on
the
scene
from
the
lower
end
of
a
narrow
street
usually
well
crowded
but
now
absolutely
crammed
with
people
there
surged
along
an
agitated
multitude
carrying
such
of
their
goods
as
they
had
been
able
to
snatch
from
the
devouring
element
that
closely
pursued
them
i
approached
as
near
as
i
could
to
the
burning
houses
but
finding
that
the
conflagration
was
rapidly
advancing
beat
a
hasty
retreat
and
made
my
way
to
the
open
space
at
the
back
of
the
settlement
where
a
terrible
spectacle
of
confusion
presented
itself
to
my
eyes
the
portion
of
the
native
town
where
the
fire
was
raging
most
violently
was
on
a
small
island
surrounded
by
a
muddy
swamp
and
connected
with
the
rest
of
yokohama
by
a
wooden
bridge
already
crowded
with
fugitives
to
wade
or
swim
across
to
the
firm
ground
was
impossible
there
were
one
or
two
boats
available
but
they
were
already
overcrowded
and
their
occupants
were
so
paralysed
by
fear
that
they
never
thought
of
landing
and
sending
back
the
boats
to
take
off
others
most
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
quarter
were
women
i
saw
a
few
poor
wretches
plunge
into
the
water
in
order
to
escape
but
they
failed
to
reach
the
nearer
bank
it
was
a
fearful
sight
to
see
the
flames
darting
among
the
roofs
of
the
houses
on
the
causeway
and
sending
forth
jets
here
and
there
where
the
fire
had
not
yet
attained
full
mastery
when
suddenly
one
half
of
the
street
nearest
blazed
up
with
a
tremendous
flash
and
a
volume
of
black
smoke
arose
which
obscured
the
sky
this
was
an
oil
merchant
shop
that
had
caught
fire
i
turned
and
fled
homewards
for
there
was
no
time
to
lose
i
knew
my
own
house
was
doomed
as
it
lay
directly
to
leeward
and
a
violent
wind
was
blowing
from
the
as
i
passed
through
the
little
garden
i
shouted
to
willis
to
bestir
himself
and
called
my
servants
to
assist
in
packing
up
my
movables
my
first
thought
was
for
my
dictionary
if
that
went
i
lost
the
results
of
two
years
labour
so
i
put
it
into
a
light
chest
of
drawers
and
huddled
some
clothes
in
from
the
wardrobe
to
get
our
things
out
we
had
to
break
down
the
high
wooden
fence
round
the
garden
at
this
moment
up
came
some
friends
who
plunged
into
the
house
and
reappeared
some
with
books
others
with
half
a
chest
of
drawers
and
we
worked
with
a
will
until
the
building
was
cleared
of
everything
but
carpets
curtains
and
the
heavier
furniture
my
harmonium
a
massive
article
was
also
got
into
the
street
and
some
men
from
the
garrison
carried
it
away
to
a
place
of
safety
by
the
time
we
had
removed
the
salvage
to
what
we
thought
was
a
respectable
distance
the
fire
had
reached
the
house
which
five
minutes
later
was
a
heap
of
glowing
embers
it
now
became
evident
that
the
houses
in
the
rear
of
the
settlement
had
caught
fire
and
as
my
property
was
lying
on
the
open
space
between
the
foreign
and
native
towns
it
had
to
be
transported
further
here
occurred
a
serious
loss
most
of
my
books
were
in
boxes
which
had
been
carried
out
bodily
but
the
rest
hastily
wrapped
up
in
blankets
had
to
be
left
there
were
plenty
of
pilferers
about
who
under
the
pretence
of
helping
carried
off
chests
full
of
clothing
that
i
never
saw
again
i
lost
a
good
many
european
volumes
and
a
large
number
of
japanese
books
besides
some
notes
on
manchu
and
chinese
which
were
irreplaceable
after
we
had
deposited
our
property
where
we
thought
it
would
be
in
safety
it
was
threatened
by
the
progress
of
the
flames
and
was
therefore
removed
to
a
godown
belonging
to
our
friends
wilkin
and
robison
at
no
in
the
settlement
by
this
time
the
area
of
destruction
had
extended
to
the
main
street
of
the
native
town
and
the
houses
where
a
mitford
von
siebold
walsh
and
vidal
lived
as
well
as
our
own
had
already
gone
a
japanese
house
lightly
built
of
wood
with
paper
instead
of
glass
takes
little
time
to
burn
next
the
fire
spread
to
the
nearest
houses
in
the
foreign
settlement
huge
sparks
and
pieces
of
red
hot
wood
flew
across
the
intervening
space
set
the
american
consulate
alight
ignited
the
roof
of
jardine
matheson
and
began
to
spread
along
both
streets
of
the
settlement
the
supposed
fireproof
godown
where
most
of
our
things
were
deposited
caught
fire
and
nearly
everything
we
had
saved
was
destroyed
it
was
a
scene
of
the
wildest
confusion
bluejackets
were
landed
from
the
ships
and
soldiers
came
down
from
the
camp
to
work
at
the
fire
engines
there
was
no
discipline
among
the
men
and
no
organization
existed
for
dealing
with
the
disaster
after
the
final
destruction
of
my
own
property
i
went
about
helping
others
to
save
theirs
or
to
fight
the
flames
handing
buckets
fetching
water
pouring
it
on
whatever
seemed
most
inflammable
some
of
the
redcoats
behaved
disgracefully
they
had
managed
to
get
hold
of
liquor
and
stood
by
drinking
and
jeering
while
we
civilians
did
the
work
they
had
been
brought
there
to
perform
at
the
close
of
the
day
there
remained
to
me
only
the
clothes
i
had
on
my
back
and
i
was
hatless
but
the
excitement
had
been
so
lively
that
i
felt
rather
pleased
at
the
idea
of
beginning
the
world
afresh
i
had
saved
the
manuscript
of
the
dictionary
on
which
ishibashi
and
i
were
then
engaged
as
well
as
that
of
an
annotated
edition
of
sir
alcock
which
was
then
in
the
press
though
destined
never
to
see
the
light
my
loss
came
to
between
and
a
portion
of
which
was
afterwards
made
good
to
me
by
her
government
the
losses
of
the
insurance
offices
amounted
to
or
about
the
value
of
what
was
not
insured
was
not
great
the
conflagration
raged
so
fiercely
among
the
foreign
warehouses
and
residences
that
before
four
in
the
afternoon
it
had
made
its
way
half
down
the
bund
leaving
only
the
standing
and
at
one
period
it
was
thought
that
the
whole
settlement
would
be
in
a
blaze
before
night
if
that
had
happened
the
european
community
would
have
had
to
seek
an
asylum
on
board
ship
but
fortunately
our
fears
were
not
realized
the
flames
seemed
invincible
by
the
side
of
our
puny
efforts
the
expedient
was
resorted
to
of
blowing
up
houses
in
the
line
of
fire
but
not
with
great
success
for
some
of
those
so
destroyed
were
never
touched
by
it
at
all
while
in
other
instances
the
could
not
be
cleared
away
and
only
helped
it
to
spread
to
the
buildings
beyond
one
hundred
and
seven
europeans
and
americans
were
rendered
homeless
and
many
of
those
who
had
trusted
in
their
fireproof
godowns
were
left
without
anything
in
the
world
but
the
clothes
they
stood
in
merchants
whose
goods
were
uninsured
were
devoured
by
a
terrible
anxiety
for
the
most
stone
godowns
seemed
to
offer
little
more
resistance
than
the
wooden
houses
of
the
japanese
although
the
wind
had
fallen
much
apprehension
was
entertained
for
the
safety
of
what
still
remained
unburnt
for
owing
to
the
damaged
condition
of
the
hose
all
the
fire
engines
had
become
useless
and
nothing
could
be
done
to
extinguish
the
smouldering
embers
the
fire
was
therefore
left
to
burn
itself
out
and
four
days
elapsed
before
the
flames
entirely
died
down
the
price
of
clothing
rose
incredibly
as
also
did
house
rent
yokohama
was
not
as
well
supplied
with
hatters
tailors
and
bootmakers
as
it
is
in
these
days
and
most
men
were
in
the
habit
of
supplying
themselves
from
home
for
the
next
two
years
consequently
i
was
reduced
to
a
very
moderate
wardrobe
i
had
for
example
to
pay
or
shillings
for
five
pocket
handkerchiefs
after
the
fire
i
took
up
my
abode
with
my
friend
tom
foster
then
the
manager
of
gilman
yokohama
branch
until
the
or
of
december
when
i
migrated
to
the
legation
at
yedo
the
new
buildings
in
front
of
were
now
completed
and
enclosed
by
a
lofty
black
wooden
fence
which
imparted
to
the
establishment
somewhat
of
the
aspect
of
a
jail
there
were
two
long
wooden
buildings
one
of
which
was
the
minister
residence
the
other
being
occupied
by
the
members
of
the
chancery
eusden
had
gone
to
hakodaté
as
acting
consul
and
the
staff
consisted
of
mitford
as
second
secretary
willis
as
assistant
accountant
and
medical
officer
siebold
and
myself
as
interpreters
and
vidal
as
student
interpreter
the
infantry
guard
was
commanded
by
lieutenant
bradshaw
sidney
locock
the
first
secretary
a
married
man
with
a
family
lived
at
yokohama
as
did
also
wilkinson
still
a
student
they
were
ramshackle
buildings
all
windows
and
doors
terribly
cold
from
want
of
proper
fireplaces
and
bad
construction
which
admitted
draughts
on
every
side
but
i
did
not
live
there
long
after
my
transfer
from
the
yokohama
consulate
to
the
legation
in
the
autumn
of
one
of
the
first
matters
in
which
i
was
able
to
be
of
use
to
our
new
chief
was
connected
with
the
wording
of
the
treaty
in
the
english
text
the
tycoon
was
spoken
of
as
his
majesty
and
thus
placed
on
a
level
with
the
queen
in
the
japanese
version
however
this
epithet
was
rendered
by
the
equivalent
of
highness
and
it
was
thus
to
be
inferred
that
our
sovereign
was
of
lower
rank
than
the
mikado
moreover
the
word
queen
had
been
translated
by
a
title
which
was
borne
by
of
a
mikado
i
recommended
that
a
new
japanese
version
should
be
made
in
which
majesty
should
be
rendered
by
its
proper
japanese
equivalent
and
queen
by
the
word
usually
translated
by
emperor
in
all
the
dictionaries
but
really
meaning
supreme
sovereign
and
applicable
to
both
sexes
the
preparation
of
the
new
version
was
entrusted
to
my
hands
and
with
the
aid
of
my
teacher
i
managed
in
about
a
month
time
to
complete
an
accurate
translation
which
was
adopted
as
official
it
was
the
keynote
of
a
new
policy
which
recognized
the
mikado
as
the
sovereign
of
japan
and
the
tycoon
as
his
lieutenant
we
gave
up
the
use
of
tycoon
which
my
reading
had
taught
me
was
properly
a
synonym
for
the
mikado
in
our
communications
with
the
japanese
government
though
retaining
it
in
correspondence
with
the
foreign
office
in
order
not
to
create
confusion
but
the
most
important
result
was
to
set
in
a
clearer
light
than
before
the
political
theory
that
the
mikado
was
the
power
as
long
as
his
consent
had
not
been
obtained
to
the
existing
treaties
we
had
no
while
after
he
had
been
induced
to
ratify
them
the
opposition
of
the
ceased
to
have
any
logical
basis
chapter
xv
visit
to
kagoshima
and
uwajima
a
few
days
after
i
had
assumed
my
new
duties
and
had
settled
down
as
i
thought
for
a
period
of
uninterrupted
study
sir
harry
informed
me
that
he
contemplated
sending
me
down
to
nagasaki
in
the
princess
royal
which
was
about
to
proceed
thither
through
the
inland
sea
to
collect
political
information
at
hiôgo
and
elsewhere
i
was
to
return
in
the
argus
by
way
of
kagoshima
and
uwajima
the
tycoon
had
recently
died
and
had
been
succeeded
by
his
cousin
shitotsubashi
whose
position
however
was
not
very
clearly
defined
before
his
elevation
to
the
headship
of
the
tokugawa
family
he
had
been
regarded
as
a
partisan
of
the
return
to
the
ancient
régime
now
so
much
in
men
mouths
and
it
was
desirable
to
learn
as
much
as
possible
of
his
probable
line
of
policy
in
yedo
we
were
too
far
away
from
the
political
centre
to
learn
much
i
was
greatly
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
visiting
nagasaki
but
took
care
not
to
seem
too
desirous
of
being
sent
on
the
proposed
mission
lest
should
defeat
itself
next
day
i
got
a
note
from
sir
harry
who
resided
chiefly
at
yokohama
telling
me
that
he
had
not
yet
seen
the
admiral
but
that
he
still
thought
i
should
have
to
go
so
i
packed
up
some
clothes
in
a
wicker
basket
such
as
the
japanese
use
when
travelling
and
went
down
to
yokohama
in
the
gunboat
which
was
our
principal
means
of
conveyance
between
the
two
places
in
the
evening
i
learnt
that
the
matter
had
been
arranged
and
that
the
princess
royal
would
sail
the
next
day
but
one
i
wrote
to
willis
for
his
teacher
hayashi
whom
i
intended
to
put
ashore
at
hiôgo
to
collect
news
and
for
a
tin
box
containing
some
stationery
and
a
little
money
but
neither
arrived
in
time
in
despair
i
borrowed
a
few
hundred
from
foster
bought
a
box
of
cheroots
wrapped
a
few
sheets
of
foolscap
in
a
newspaper
and
got
on
board
on
the
december
just
in
time
we
had
fine
weather
for
our
start
but
encountered
a
strong
westerly
wind
outside
which
prevented
our
passing
between
vries
island
and
the
mainland
for
four
days
i
lay
in
my
cot
utterly
unable
to
eat
but
consoling
myself
with
reference
to
previous
experiences
of
the
same
kind
at
last
i
was
revived
by
a
plateful
of
greasy
beefsteak
pudding
that
admiral
king
sent
me
and
a
glass
of
champagne
the
gale
had
not
abated
and
the
huge
two
decker
rolled
terribly
at
one
time
the
betting
was
strong
on
hongkong
as
our
first
port
of
anchorage
and
hiôgo
was
given
up
as
quite
unattainable
hakodaté
yokohama
and
nagasaki
rose
by
turns
to
the
position
of
favourite
we
were
blown
right
out
of
the
chart
of
japan
and
at
last
after
many
days
of
tossing
to
and
fro
tacking
and
wearing
we
sighted
the
linschoten
islands
where
we
turned
to
the
north
and
steaming
as
fast
as
horse
power
will
carry
a
vessel
of
tons
got
into
nagasaki
on
the
evening
of
the
the
appearance
of
the
town
and
foreign
settlement
lighted
up
by
innumerable
lamps
dotted
all
over
the
hillsides
reminded
me
of
gibraltar
as
i
had
seen
it
from
the
deck
of
the
indus
a
little
more
than
five
years
previously
at
nagasaki
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
some
retainers
of
uwajima
the
most
important
of
whom
was
iséki
sayemon
afterwards
prefect
of
yokohama
in
the
first
years
of
the
mikado
rule
he
came
to
call
on
me
and
said
that
the
proposed
assemblage
of
a
council
of
at
kiôto
had
been
put
off
for
the
present
but
it
was
sure
to
take
place
eventually
and
one
of
the
first
topics
of
discussion
would
be
the
position
of
chôshiû
about
half
of
was
in
favour
of
hiôgo
being
opened
to
foreign
trade
but
the
kiûshiû
people
opposed
it
on
account
of
the
anticipated
decline
of
nagasaki
he
thought
that
the
visit
of
the
admiral
and
sir
harry
parkes
in
the
princess
royal
to
uwajima
had
done
immense
good
by
familiarizing
the
common
people
with
the
appearance
of
foreigners
and
their
ingenuity
in
the
construction
of
ships
and
warlike
appliances
the
of
uwajima
and
his
brother
the
who
was
the
leading
spirit
of
the
clan
had
excused
themselves
on
the
ground
of
sickness
from
attending
the
council
at
kiôto
shitotsubashi
had
not
yet
been
invested
with
the
office
of
shôgun
and
its
attendant
court
titles
and
the
probability
was
that
they
would
be
withheld
until
he
had
settled
the
chôshiû
difficulty
which
would
doubtless
give
him
a
good
deal
of
trouble
when
i
met
him
again
on
the
following
day
the
conversation
turned
upon
our
relations
with
chôshiû
i
told
him
that
the
british
government
had
stationed
a
at
shimonoséki
to
prevent
merchant
vessels
frequenting
the
straits
during
the
continuance
of
hostilities
between
chôshiû
and
the
tycoon
we
did
not
wish
to
interfere
in
any
of
the
civil
quarrels
of
the
japanese
we
were
at
peace
with
chôshiû
who
had
agreed
to
let
foreign
vessels
pass
without
molestation
and
had
undertaken
to
let
them
purchase
wood
water
and
other
necessaries
while
promising
to
build
no
more
batteries
the
tycoon
government
had
undertaken
to
pay
the
indemnity
imposed
upon
the
prince
of
chôshiû
the
powers
however
did
not
care
for
the
money
and
would
be
willing
at
any
time
to
abandon
the
indemnity
if
their
doing
so
would
tend
to
the
improvement
of
relations
with
japan
the
people
had
asked
for
delay
in
making
payment
of
the
remaining
instalments
and
in
consenting
to
this
the
foreign
ministers
had
obtained
in
return
the
concession
of
permission
for
japanese
to
travel
in
foreign
countries
it
was
to
be
supposed
however
that
the
nation
was
desirous
of
having
the
ancient
prohibition
removed
and
the
government
would
have
had
therefore
no
excuse
for
maintaining
it
hiôgo
would
certainly
be
opened
on
the
of
january
in
accordance
with
the
undertaking
entered
into
by
the
tycoon
the
intention
of
the
powers
was
to
uphold
the
treaties
in
their
entirety
and
get
them
carried
out
we
could
not
ask
for
the
opening
of
shimonoséki
under
the
present
treaties
as
the
tycoon
authority
did
not
extend
so
far
it
would
require
a
separate
treaty
with
chôshiû
as
long
as
the
present
treaties
remained
unchanged
no
ports
could
be
opened
in
territories
at
hiôgo
we
had
discussed
matters
with
the
tycoon
council
who
we
now
learnt
had
deceived
us
by
concealing
the
mikado
injunction
to
them
to
negotiate
for
the
abandonment
of
ozaka
and
hiôgo
as
seats
of
foreign
commerce
it
was
a
pity
we
had
not
thrown
them
over
and
negotiated
direct
with
the
mikado
court
from
which
we
heard
that
a
noble
had
been
deputed
to
visit
the
foreign
representatives
during
my
stay
at
nagasaki
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
officers
from
tosa
and
higo
one
of
the
latter
said
that
there
never
would
be
another
shôgun
but
that
the
mikado
would
be
restored
to
the
throne
here
was
a
clear
glimpse
into
the
future
my
instructions
from
sir
harry
were
to
proceed
from
nagasaki
to
kagoshima
and
uwajima
and
call
in
at
hiôgo
on
my
way
back
i
embarked
therefore
on
the
january
in
the
argus
commander
round
with
my
two
servants
noguchi
tomizô
and
yasu
the
former
was
a
young
of
aidzu
who
had
left
his
home
and
attached
himself
to
vyse
our
consul
at
hakodaté
in
order
to
study
english
in
the
autumn
of
he
came
to
live
with
me
to
carry
on
his
studies
and
on
the
present
occasion
he
had
accompanied
me
to
nagasaki
whence
he
was
to
have
gone
to
england
as
to
alexander
buller
the
commander
of
the
flagship
but
whether
it
was
the
tossing
about
on
the
way
down
or
the
disagreeable
servant
position
he
now
changed
his
mind
and
begged
me
to
take
him
back
to
yedo
buller
expressed
himself
as
somewhat
annoyed
but
i
could
not
help
it
noguchi
eventually
went
with
me
in
to
england
where
i
paid
for
his
schooling
during
a
couple
of
years
after
my
return
to
japan
he
stayed
on
awhile
in
london
at
the
expense
of
the
japanese
government
and
eventually
came
back
to
tôkiô
where
he
obtained
a
minor
appointment
in
a
public
office
in
spite
of
his
then
comparatively
elevated
position
he
never
gave
himself
airs
or
forgot
that
i
had
befriended
him
and
it
was
with
great
regret
that
i
heard
of
his
death
about
the
beginning
of
he
was
honest
and
faithful
to
the
end
yasu
was
a
young
monkey
belonging
to
the
lower
classes
and
i
do
remember
that
he
had
any
virtues
round
did
not
treat
me
very
well
and
made
me
sleep
in
the
cockpit
a
sort
of
common
den
in
the
bottom
of
the
ship
where
the
midshipmen
keep
their
chests
and
sling
their
hammocks
there
was
no
privacy
and
we
were
crowded
together
in
a
most
uncomfortable
manner
i
got
a
cot
to
sleep
in
but
no
mattress
or
pillow
and
was
forced
to
borrow
a
cushion
off
a
bunk
in
the
captain
cabin
and
roll
up
my
greatcoat
for
a
pillow
we
reached
kagoshima
next
day
early
in
the
afternoon
as
soon
as
we
dropped
our
anchor
some
officers
pulled
off
from
the
shore
bringing
a
flag
for
us
to
hoist
while
firing
the
salute
in
answer
to
theirs
matsuoka
jiûdaiyu
came
on
board
to
explain
that
the
prince
and
his
father
were
in
retirement
owing
to
the
recent
death
of
the
mother
as
neither
was
able
to
receive
visitors
the
duty
of
receiving
the
admiral
letter
of
which
we
were
the
bearers
would
be
performed
by
the
prince
second
brother
and
two
councillors
this
was
a
letter
thanking
him
for
kindness
shown
to
shipwrecked
sailors
sir
harry
and
the
admiral
on
their
visit
in
the
previous
summer
had
seen
and
conversed
with
both
the
prince
and
his
father
shimadzu
saburô
but
i
do
not
suppose
that
my
being
unable
to
meet
them
made
much
difference
to
the
result
of
my
visit
as
the
conduct
of
affairs
was
to
a
great
extent
in
the
hands
of
the
principal
retainers
i
went
ashore
to
stay
at
the
factory
with
three
englishmen
named
sutcliffe
harrison
and
shillingford
the
last
of
these
an
engineer
by
profession
had
been
engaged
by
the
in
connection
with
some
cotton
mills
which
he
was
erecting
the
other
two
had
come
to
kagoshima
in
search
of
employment
on
the
round
came
on
shore
with
a
party
of
officers
to
deliver
the
admiral
letter
and
i
accompanied
him
to
interpret
we
were
met
at
the
by
some
high
officials
who
conducted
us
through
the
town
for
half
a
mile
to
the
house
where
we
were
received
by
shimadzu
dzusho
a
handsome
youth
the
second
son
of
shimadzu
saburô
niiro
giôbu
a
councillor
who
had
been
in
england
and
shimadzu
isé
also
a
councillor
it
was
a
house
set
apart
for
the
reception
of
visitors
the
brother
years
years
of
age
seemed
a
perfect
child
as
far
as
intelligence
went
all
the
talking
was
done
by
the
high
officials
who
sat
on
his
right
hand
i
interpreted
the
contents
of
the
letter
which
was
then
handed
to
shimadzu
dzusho
the
whole
ceremony
not
occupying
more
than
five
minutes
we
then
sat
down
to
an
entertainment
which
opened
with
a
few
courses
of
japanese
cookery
with
but
consisted
in
the
main
of
an
interminable
succession
of
european
dishes
moistened
with
sherry
champagne
and
brandy
i
took
my
revenge
upon
round
by
keeping
up
a
lively
conversation
in
japanese
and
translating
none
of
it
so
the
poor
man
was
driven
to
count
the
oranges
in
a
dish
which
stood
near
in
order
to
keep
off
ennui
after
the
banquet
the
officers
dispersed
themselves
through
the
town
while
i
remained
behind
to
assist
in
making
a
translation
of
the
admiral
letter
niiro
also
stopped
we
talked
about
the
proposed
meeting
of
which
had
been
postponed
then
i
praised
the
composition
of
a
letter
which
had
been
addressed
to
the
mikado
in
the
name
of
the
prince
of
satsuma
some
months
back
did
you
see
it
what
a
stupid
document
it
was
said
niiro
not
at
all
i
replied
i
thought
it
excellent
and
the
style
was
worthy
of
all
praise
had
it
not
reference
to
hiôgo
no
i
mean
the
memorial
objecting
to
sending
satsuma
troops
to
with
those
of
the
tycoon
against
chôshiû
oh
yes
shimadzu
isé
who
sat
next
to
me
was
the
writer
of
that
letter
he
was
in
kiôto
at
the
time
how
is
the
chôshiû
business
getting
on
i
asked
i
hear
the
tycoon
has
withdrawn
the
greater
part
of
his
troops
chôshiû
is
very
strong
he
replied
and
he
has
right
on
his
side
none
of
the
will
support
the
tycoon
and
the
latter
has
now
no
chance
of
beating
him
well
i
think
that
if
he
had
put
his
best
troops
into
the
field
and
attacked
chôshiû
energetically
at
first
he
must
have
conquered
him
no
never
he
had
not
right
on
his
side
you
appear
to
be
very
friendly
with
chôshiû
i
remarked
no
said
he
not
friendly
but
we
have
a
natural
for
one
of
our
own
class
niiro
reference
to
the
letter
of
the
prince
of
satsuma
which
he
supposed
i
had
seen
revealed
the
important
fact
that
the
satsuma
clan
were
opposed
to
the
opening
of
hiôgo
and
in
fact
it
was
the
presentation
of
this
letter
or
memorial
to
the
mikado
during
the
visit
of
the
foreign
representatives
in
november
which
had
encouraged
the
mikado
to
make
it
a
condition
of
giving
his
sanction
to
the
treaties
that
the
tycoon
should
arrange
for
that
port
being
given
up
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
impress
on
niiro
mind
for
the
benefit
of
his
fellow
clansmen
that
the
foreign
powers
would
not
for
a
moment
entertain
the
idea
of
giving
up
hiôgo
or
any
other
part
of
the
treaties
at
this
moment
there
was
lying
in
the
bay
a
little
steamer
named
the
otentosama
belonging
to
chôshiû
she
had
brought
down
the
leading
man
of
that
clan
katsura
kogorô
afterwards
known
during
the
year
of
the
revolution
as
kido
junichirô
i
said
to
niiro
that
i
should
like
to
call
on
him
to
inquire
after
some
of
my
shimonoséki
friends
niiro
replied
that
katsura
was
to
have
an
interview
with
shimadzu
saburô
at
ten
the
same
evening
and
a
meeting
afterwards
with
some
of
the
satsuma
councillors
at
three
in
the
morning
if
i
wished
particularly
to
see
him
i
might
go
and
sleep
at
his
lodgings
and
wait
till
he
turned
up
i
declined
the
invitation
preferring
a
european
bed
for
at
that
time
i
was
not
so
accustomed
to
japanese
ways
as
i
afterwards
became
it
was
weak
on
my
part
but
what
niiro
said
rendered
it
perfectly
clear
that
an
understanding
was
being
negotiated
between
the
two
most
powerful
of
the
western
clans
and
that
they
would
henceforth
be
united
against
the
tycoon
fortunate
for
us
that
they
were
on
friendly
terms
with
us
and
fortunate
also
for
the
general
interest
of
foreign
powers
between
whom
and
the
revolutionary
government
of
the
british
legation
acted
as
mediators
the
french
legation
on
the
other
hand
supported
the
tycoon
roches
was
projecting
the
foundation
of
the
arsenal
at
yokosuka
which
would
place
the
military
organization
of
the
tokugawa
family
on
a
new
and
superior
footing
and
he
had
procured
a
distinguished
staff
of
french
officers
to
drill
the
tycoon
troops
it
was
even
rumoured
that
he
had
made
or
was
contemplating
making
offers
of
material
assistance
to
shitotsubashi
and
this
policy
he
pursued
until
the
logic
of
facts
at
last
demonstrated
its
folly
being
followed
by
the
north
german
chargé
d
affaires
herr
von
brandt
and
the
italian
minister
count
la
tour
the
netherlands
political
agent
however
adhered
to
sir
harry
while
the
new
american
minister
general
van
valkenburg
was
neutral
we
had
felt
the
pulse
of
the
japanese
people
more
carefully
and
diagnosed
the
political
condition
better
than
our
rivals
so
that
the
prestige
of
the
british
minister
in
the
years
and
was
completely
in
the
ascendant
on
the
january
the
prince
reply
was
to
have
been
delivered
on
board
the
argus
but
at
noon
niiro
presented
himself
to
say
that
it
was
not
yet
ready
we
therefore
landed
and
inspected
the
glass
factory
shot
and
shell
foundry
gun
foundry
and
pot
and
kettle
foundry
near
the
prince
garden
at
iso
the
letter
now
arrived
in
charge
of
matsuoka
and
after
its
formal
delivery
we
sat
down
once
more
to
a
banquet
in
european
style
it
was
shorter
than
that
of
the
previous
day
and
the
dishes
better
cooked
but
it
was
politeness
rather
than
gastronomic
satisfaction
that
caused
us
to
praise
it
for
in
truth
the
dinner
was
bad
and
about
five
i
started
off
with
sutcliffe
to
call
on
niiro
who
had
not
been
seen
since
the
morning
after
an
hour
walking
we
arrived
at
his
house
darkness
having
already
set
in
niiro
received
us
very
cordially
and
entertained
us
with
tea
oranges
beer
cakes
and
conversation
for
an
hour
and
a
half
he
told
me
that
in
passing
through
hiôgo
lately
he
had
heard
that
the
french
minister
was
shortly
expected
there
with
a
letter
from
the
emperor
napoleon
iii
and
that
there
was
to
be
a
general
gathering
of
foreign
representatives
shitotsubashi
had
disappointed
his
friends
by
accepting
the
succession
to
the
headship
of
the
tokugawa
family
and
was
suspected
of
wishing
to
establish
his
power
as
tycoon
with
the
aid
of
foreigners
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
they
regarded
the
french
with
dislike
and
distrust
and
seemed
to
be
all
the
more
friendly
with
us
because
they
had
learnt
to
appreciate
the
value
of
our
enmity
the
satsuma
people
seemed
to
be
making
great
progress
in
the
civilized
arts
and
gave
me
the
impression
of
great
courage
and
straightforwardness
i
thought
they
would
soon
be
far
ahead
of
the
rest
of
japan
tycoon
as
i
have
said
before
was
the
title
given
in
the
treaties
to
the
temporal
sovereign
the
japanese
however
never
used
it
shôgun
or
generalissimo
for
the
subjugation
of
barbarians
was
his
official
designation
which
delicacy
prevented
his
ministers
from
employing
in
their
official
communications
with
the
foreign
representatives
while
the
common
people
spoke
of
him
as
the
opposition
however
had
adopted
the
term
which
most
closely
might
be
rendered
by
military
establishment
and
it
was
this
term
that
my
friends
and
i
used
in
conversation
in
like
manner
for
the
honorific
designation
noble
old
men
applied
in
the
east
of
japan
to
the
tycoon
council
of
ministers
the
expression
old
ones
was
substituted
the
opposition
refused
to
recognize
that
the
government
which
they
wished
to
upset
was
entitled
to
any
mark
of
respect
on
the
january
we
left
kagoshima
and
anchored
in
uwajima
bay
at
eleven
on
the
following
day
the
beautiful
bay
is
completely
landlocked
and
surrounded
by
hills
of
varying
height
up
to
feet
close
behind
the
town
on
its
east
side
rises
a
high
peak
known
as
the
demon
castle
the
fortress
was
a
conspicuous
object
to
the
right
of
the
town
it
stood
on
a
low
wooded
hill
close
to
the
seashore
and
consisted
of
a
keep
surrounded
by
a
double
wall
of
stonework
surmounted
by
white
plastered
walls
almost
hidden
by
the
trees
south
of
this
lay
the
official
quarter
the
citizens
quarter
being
to
the
east
and
north
stretching
for
some
distance
along
the
shore
as
the
hills
behind
leave
the
town
no
room
to
expand
close
in
shore
the
water
is
very
shallow
and
advantage
had
been
taken
of
this
to
construct
salterns
and
reclaim
rice
fields
by
building
a
dyke
there
was
a
small
battery
on
each
side
of
the
bay
more
for
show
than
for
defensive
use
about
an
hour
and
a
half
after
we
anchored
a
boat
was
noticed
hovering
about
the
stern
with
a
person
in
the
busily
engaged
in
examining
the
ship
through
an
opera
glass
finding
out
that
it
was
the
prince
commander
round
sent
a
gig
at
once
to
invite
him
on
board
he
explained
his
curious
behaviour
by
saying
that
he
had
wished
to
remain
the
admiral
letter
wishing
him
a
happy
new
year
was
produced
and
after
i
had
translated
its
contents
he
took
possession
of
it
he
was
aged
of
about
middle
height
and
had
an
aristocratic
cast
of
countenance
with
a
slightly
aquiline
nose
on
the
whole
a
handsome
man
as
a
matter
of
course
he
was
shown
over
the
ship
in
the
meantime
i
had
some
conversation
with
a
young
man
of
about
twenty
years
of
age
named
matsuné
kura
son
of
the
principal
he
said
that
satsuma
and
uwajima
were
on
very
friendly
terms
which
was
natural
as
the
and
shimadzu
saburô
had
been
amongst
the
little
band
of
princes
who
were
disgraced
for
their
opposition
to
the
elevation
of
the
lately
deceased
tycoon
shitotsubashi
had
not
been
appointed
shôgun
and
perhaps
never
would
be
when
the
prince
returned
on
shore
i
accompanied
him
in
the
gig
and
found
a
number
of
his
women
waiting
for
him
on
the
bank
with
his
children
the
eldest
of
whom
was
a
little
boy
of
seven
years
of
age
the
others
were
mostly
babies
in
arms
and
each
was
attended
by
an
undernurse
bearing
a
small
sword
wrapped
in
gold
brocade
the
japanese
was
accustomed
to
the
companionship
of
his
weapon
from
his
very
infancy
the
prince
was
extremely
affable
and
promised
to
repeat
his
visit
on
the
following
day
and
to
bring
the
or
with
him
i
said
and
went
into
the
town
where
i
met
three
officers
from
the
ship
engaged
in
curio
hunting
an
immense
crowd
followed
us
everywhere
examining
our
clothes
and
asking
all
manner
of
questions
but
behaving
with
the
utmost
civility
i
felt
my
heart
warm
more
and
more
to
the
japanese
on
the
january
it
rained
violently
and
blew
hard
all
day
but
the
weather
did
not
prevent
the
and
the
from
coming
on
board
the
latter
was
a
tall
man
with
strongly
marked
features
and
a
big
nose
and
reputed
to
be
one
of
the
most
intelligent
of
his
class
imperious
in
manner
and
years
of
age
he
was
not
a
born
that
was
the
surname
of
the
uwajima
but
had
been
adopted
from
a
family
in
yedo
after
his
adoption
the
present
was
born
and
the
relationship
between
them
was
that
of
brothers
by
adoption
but
still
the
adopted
son
could
not
be
set
aside
and
he
eventually
succeeded
to
the
title
and
fief
but
by
way
of
compensation
to
the
younger
brother
who
had
lost
his
birthright
he
adopted
him
as
his
son
consequently
when
the
prince
was
disgraced
in
the
real
heir
succeeded
living
retired
is
a
common
term
for
the
head
of
a
family
whether
noble
or
commoner
who
has
given
up
the
active
headship
and
the
management
of
the
estate
to
his
son
a
not
unusual
thing
in
old
japan
for
a
father
who
had
reached
the
sixties
here
the
was
manifestly
the
ruling
spirit
and
it
was
touching
to
observe
the
immense
respect
paid
to
him
by
the
titular
prince
who
always
addressed
him
as
father
while
he
on
his
part
used
the
depreciatory
term
my
youngster
in
speaking
of
the
they
stopped
for
a
couple
of
hours
talking
and
drinking
some
moselle
with
which
i
had
provided
myself
at
nagasaki
the
began
to
talk
eagerly
to
me
about
the
very
suspicious
intimacy
that
existed
between
the
tycoon
government
and
the
french
legation
but
as
soon
as
old
matsuné
the
principal
councillor
perceived
that
his
master
was
becoming
indiscreet
he
hurried
him
away
on
the
pretext
that
it
would
be
too
late
to
fire
the
salute
so
away
they
went
amid
the
thunder
of
seventeen
guns
which
was
returned
from
one
of
the
batteries
after
he
left
the
wives
and
families
of
the
two
princes
flocked
on
board
they
were
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
us
and
conversed
with
as
much
ease
and
readiness
as
european
ladies
there
was
a
japanese
officer
on
board
afterwards
admiral
hayashi
kenzô
noguchi
who
had
been
ashore
to
have
a
hot
bath
and
get
shaved
had
brought
me
an
invitation
to
dine
with
iriyé
the
captain
of
the
battery
so
i
took
a
boat
and
went
off
in
spite
of
the
wind
and
rain
my
host
had
not
yet
returned
from
his
duties
but
his
wife
asked
me
to
come
in
and
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
made
his
appearance
soon
afterwards
another
artillery
officer
named
mori
came
in
and
then
two
more
juniors
dinner
was
at
once
ordered
it
consisted
of
innumerable
courses
of
fish
and
soup
and
lasted
from
six
till
eleven
we
talked
drank
hot
and
sang
by
turns
and
i
had
to
answer
a
multitude
of
questions
on
all
possible
subjects
this
gave
me
numerous
opportunities
of
uttering
appropriate
wise
saws
and
proverbial
sayings
which
gave
my
hearers
unbounded
delight
and
inspired
them
with
no
small
amount
of
respect
for
the
philosophy
of
the
western
peoples
at
eleven
the
last
guest
retired
and
after
we
had
eaten
a
little
rice
we
went
to
bed
in
japanese
fashion
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
one
could
sleep
comfortably
without
sheets
on
the
following
morning
after
a
good
breakfast
la
i
rejoined
the
ship
and
started
in
company
with
round
and
wright
and
dunn
of
the
ixth
regiment
who
as
i
have
hitherto
neglected
to
mention
had
come
on
board
at
nagasaki
for
the
rifle
range
in
accordance
with
an
engagement
made
on
the
previous
day
a
guard
of
honour
of
men
received
us
at
the
and
we
were
escorted
by
an
officer
of
the
uwajima
navy
we
found
another
guard
which
fell
in
and
led
us
up
a
pretty
stiff
hill
to
the
ranges
some
of
our
men
were
landed
to
exhibit
their
skill
we
had
to
walk
a
short
distance
and
climb
the
hills
there
is
not
sufficient
flat
ground
in
uwajima
for
a
proper
rifle
range
so
the
butts
were
placed
on
the
side
of
another
hill
separated
from
us
by
a
valley
about
yards
wide
here
we
found
tents
set
us
and
the
his
own
son
and
the
prince
awaiting
our
arrival
our
men
who
were
not
accustomed
to
shooting
across
a
chasm
of
unknown
depth
and
width
showed
themselves
less
skilful
than
the
uwajima
marksmen
who
had
the
advantage
of
knowing
their
ground
we
got
the
shooting
over
by
one
and
the
whole
party
then
proceeded
to
the
or
palace
which
was
outside
the
castle
it
was
an
old
building
dating
from
about
years
back
but
without
pretensions
to
architectural
style
we
were
not
received
at
the
great
entrance
but
at
some
temporary
steps
erected
for
the
occasion
which
led
up
at
once
from
the
garden
into
the
verandah
here
old
matsuné
met
us
and
conducted
us
into
a
long
room
which
was
shut
off
on
all
sides
by
handsome
folding
screens
covered
with
gold
leaf
at
one
end
of
the
room
was
a
particularly
large
screen
which
the
prince
said
was
a
present
to
his
ancestor
from
the
great
a
table
was
placed
down
the
middle
of
the
room
with
armchairs
on
the
right
side
for
the
the
prince
and
matsuné
while
on
the
left
were
seated
round
and
his
officers
i
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
to
facilitate
conversation
the
dinner
was
beautifully
got
up
every
separate
dish
prettily
arranged
and
decorated
but
the
most
tasteful
of
all
was
a
wild
duck
with
all
its
plumage
perfect
and
the
roasted
meat
cut
up
small
and
laid
on
the
back
between
the
wings
elevated
in
such
a
way
as
to
convey
the
idea
that
the
bird
was
swimming
and
flying
at
the
same
time
other
dishes
consisted
of
huge
crayfish
and
there
was
a
large
baked
tai
as
required
by
etiquette
for
each
person
each
of
us
had
a
large
porcelain
cup
to
drink
from
and
the
warm
liquor
was
handed
round
in
pewter
vessels
with
long
spouts
like
flat
teapots
the
exchanged
cups
with
round
myself
and
the
two
redcoats
in
turn
and
the
same
ceremony
was
aftwards
gone
through
with
the
prince
and
his
minister
old
matsuné
there
was
a
good
deal
of
eating
and
saké
drinking
and
the
presented
me
with
a
large
shallow
cup
of
red
lacquer
which
i
had
first
to
empty
my
companions
left
early
while
at
the
request
i
remained
behind
for
some
conversation
on
politics
he
began
by
speaking
of
hiôgo
as
to
which
he
had
expressed
his
opinion
to
sir
harry
parkes
in
july
last
but
he
was
now
in
favour
of
opening
the
place
to
foreign
trade
and
so
was
shitotsubashi
he
had
heard
that
negotiations
were
proceeding
with
the
french
for
its
being
opened
next
september
but
he
would
prefer
that
the
arrangements
should
be
made
with
us
rather
than
with
the
french
whom
he
did
not
like
i
replied
that
i
believed
the
french
policy
was
based
upon
the
belief
that
the
country
needed
a
recognized
head
and
that
as
they
had
a
treaty
with
the
shôgun
who
apparently
was
the
most
powerful
political
personage
they
thought
it
would
be
better
to
strengthen
him
as
far
as
possible
the
english
policy
was
different
we
regarded
our
treaty
as
having
been
made
with
japan
and
not
with
the
shôgun
in
particular
if
with
the
latter
then
as
there
was
no
actual
shôgun
at
the
moment
our
treaty
would
have
to
be
regarded
as
being
in
abeyance
we
did
not
wish
to
interfere
and
were
quite
content
that
the
japanese
should
settle
their
internal
disputes
among
themselves
but
said
if
civil
war
becomes
chronic
your
trade
will
suffer
and
you
will
have
to
put
an
end
to
it
for
your
own
sakes
no
i
replied
for
if
we
interfered
and
took
a
side
matters
would
become
ten
times
more
difficult
and
the
foreign
trade
would
come
altogether
to
an
end
the
then
remarked
that
his
idea
was
for
japan
to
become
a
confederated
empire
with
the
mikado
for
its
head
and
that
this
idea
was
favoured
by
satsuma
and
chôshiû
i
said
i
thought
there
was
no
other
way
out
of
the
difficulty
and
i
had
written
an
article
in
a
yokohama
newspaper
to
that
effect
oh
said
the
i
have
read
it
meaning
the
translation
which
has
been
already
mentioned
at
last
the
said
let
us
send
for
the
women
and
have
some
music
the
captain
will
be
jealous
if
he
hears
that
i
produced
them
to
you
after
he
had
left
so
do
tell
him
but
if
he
hears
of
it
you
may
say
i
was
drunk
here
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
the
ladies
of
the
harem
such
a
bevy
of
pretty
women
some
wives
and
some
not
all
the
children
came
in
too
i
had
to
drink
with
all
of
the
ladies
till
i
began
to
fear
my
head
might
give
way
musical
instruments
were
brought
in
and
a
great
deal
of
was
drunk
greatly
to
the
increase
of
friendliness
and
conviviality
but
not
to
the
advantage
of
the
interchange
of
political
views
in
fact
the
gave
himself
up
to
enjoyment
and
would
talk
no
more
he
afterwards
said
in
a
casual
sort
of
way
you
must
not
let
it
appear
in
the
newspapers
that
i
went
on
board
the
argus
for
i
have
declined
attending
the
meeting
at
kiôto
on
the
ground
of
sickness
and
i
should
not
wish
the
government
to
hear
of
it
i
should
not
like
to
be
at
kiôto
just
now
after
the
music
had
begun
i
looked
round
and
saw
one
of
the
officers
of
the
argus
who
had
come
in
after
the
captain
departure
performing
a
japanese
dance
i
proposed
to
him
to
dance
a
hornpipe
which
he
at
once
did
and
the
a
man
of
the
sober
age
of
got
up
placed
himself
opposite
and
tried
to
imitate
the
steps
holding
up
his
loose
trousers
with
both
hands
the
fun
infected
two
of
the
ministers
who
joined
him
in
a
reel
after
drinking
a
great
deal
of
with
the
two
princes
and
their
ladies
i
was
carried
off
no
led
to
his
own
house
by
old
matsuné
where
more
was
produced
and
i
was
made
acquainted
with
the
rest
of
his
family
after
about
an
hour
conversation
i
was
glad
to
get
to
bed
for
the
fumes
of
the
hot
were
beginning
to
have
some
effect
on
my
head
hayashi
young
matsuné
another
japanese
and
myself
slept
in
one
room
next
morning
i
was
roused
before
daylight
by
the
report
of
a
signal
gun
fired
from
the
argus
to
announce
that
she
was
ready
to
leave
i
dressed
hastily
and
went
on
board
with
young
matsuné
to
whom
i
presented
my
opera
glass
as
a
souvenir
noguchi
and
my
boy
yasu
who
had
also
been
sleeping
on
shore
had
not
yet
made
their
appearance
but
round
refused
to
wait
for
them
so
i
begged
matsuné
to
send
them
somehow
to
yokohama
and
advance
them
any
money
which
they
might
ask
for
to
be
repaid
to
the
uwajima
agent
in
yedo
at
six
we
weighed
anchor
and
steamed
out
of
the
bay
full
of
regrets
at
being
obliged
to
part
from
our
kind
hospitable
friends
we
reached
hiôgo
about
noon
on
the
of
january
after
visiting
one
or
two
unimportant
places
in
the
inland
sea
i
went
on
shore
to
inquire
whether
we
could
get
coals
beef
and
vegetables
after
arranging
with
the
local
officials
to
send
some
supplies
on
board
i
walked
about
the
town
and
found
the
people
quite
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
a
foreigner
i
met
some
men
who
protested
that
they
were
determined
to
prevent
the
opening
of
hiôgo
to
foreign
trade
but
they
were
evidently
joking
a
hizen
man
whom
i
came
across
declared
that
i
was
an
old
acquaintance
though
i
had
never
set
eyes
on
him
before
afterwards
hayashi
kenzô
and
i
went
on
board
a
satsuma
steamer
that
was
lying
in
port
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
her
captain
inouyé
shinzayemon
she
had
brought
up
from
kagoshima
one
of
the
leading
satsuma
men
named
komatsu
tatéwaki
he
had
gone
up
to
ozaka
to
meet
saigô
the
greatest
of
all
the
satsuma
leaders
i
immediately
proposed
to
go
up
to
ozaka
and
see
them
and
letters
were
written
by
inouyé
and
hayashi
to
godai
saisuké
our
captive
of
at
kagoshima
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
next
day
however
i
heard
that
saigô
was
himself
probably
coming
to
hiôgo
and
in
the
meantime
hayashi
took
me
ashore
to
have
a
hot
bath
and
some
luncheon
la
here
for
the
first
time
i
learnt
how
to
put
on
a
cotton
gown
after
the
bath
and
enjoy
the
sensation
of
gradually
cooling
down
we
had
just
sat
down
to
eat
when
it
was
announced
that
saigô
had
arrived
and
hastily
swallowing
our
rice
we
sallied
forth
to
the
other
of
the
satsuma
men
saigô
as
i
had
all
along
suspected
turned
out
to
be
identical
with
the
man
introduced
to
me
as
shimadzu
sachiû
in
november
and
he
laughed
heartily
when
i
reminded
him
of
his
alias
after
exchanging
the
usual
compliments
i
began
to
feel
rather
at
a
loss
the
man
looked
so
stolid
and
would
not
make
conversation
but
he
had
an
eye
that
sparkled
like
a
big
black
diamond
and
his
smile
when
he
spoke
was
so
friendly
i
began
about
the
employment
of
foreigners
in
satsuma
and
the
difficulties
which
might
under
certain
circumstances
arise
from
the
residence
of
british
subjects
outside
the
treaty
limits
and
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
consular
authorities
but
this
did
not
produce
much
in
the
way
of
response
so
i
bethought
myself
of
another
subject
which
was
more
likely
to
draw
him
and
inquired
if
shitotsubashi
had
not
lately
received
in
person
a
letter
addressed
to
him
by
the
emperor
of
the
french
he
replied
yes
a
short
time
ago
he
memorialized
the
mikado
to
the
effect
that
there
was
a
letter
from
the
french
emperor
addressed
to
the
shôgun
the
reception
of
which
had
been
delayed
owing
to
the
late
detention
at
kiôto
in
connexion
with
the
expedition
against
chôshiû
that
he
now
intended
to
summon
all
the
foreign
representatives
to
ozaka
and
would
profit
by
the
occasion
to
receive
the
letter
in
question
shitotsubashi
would
accordingly
come
down
to
ozaka
on
the
of
the
japanese
month
january
and
expected
the
representatives
to
arrive
shortly
afterwards
we
the
satsuma
people
sent
up
a
copy
of
the
memorial
to
sir
harry
parkes
by
the
hands
of
yoshii
kôsuké
but
he
had
replied
that
he
was
uncertain
whether
he
would
accept
the
invitation
not
having
yet
heard
anything
direct
about
the
matter
but
i
asked
how
can
shitotsubashi
receive
a
letter
addressed
to
the
shôgun
he
is
not
shôgun
is
he
yes
he
received
his
commission
the
day
before
yesterday
well
i
replied
that
is
very
unexpected
i
thought
he
had
to
settle
chôshiû
affair
first
but
his
influence
must
have
increased
immensely
for
him
to
have
been
able
to
manage
this
yes
indeed
emphatically
a
man
who
was
yesterday
no
better
than
a
beggarly
is
who
i
asked
contrived
it
itakura
suwô
no
kami
a
newly
appointed
member
of
the
council
shitotsubashi
is
in
great
favour
now
with
the
mikado
and
he
could
become
grand
vizier
if
he
chose
he
has
made
his
brother
mimbutayu
a
younger
scion
of
the
mito
house
head
of
the
shimidzu
family
which
had
become
extinct
and
he
is
going
to
send
him
as
ambassador
to
france
on
what
business
we
have
not
the
least
idea
and
for
what
is
shitotsubashi
going
to
summon
the
foreign
representatives
to
ozaka
we
have
not
the
slightest
idea
of
that
either
said
saigô
how
odd
that
he
should
be
able
to
do
these
things
without
consulting
the
the
ought
to
have
been
consulted
as
we
expected
they
would
be
henceforth
on
all
political
matters
the
have
got
on
so
badly
of
late
years
that
my
prince
is
of
opinion
that
they
should
not
be
left
to
ruin
the
country
as
they
please
and
when
certain
of
the
were
summoned
by
the
mikado
to
kiôto
they
expected
to
have
a
share
in
the
government
now
they
perceive
that
such
is
not
the
intention
of
the
and
they
do
intend
to
be
made
fools
of
so
they
have
one
and
all
refused
to
attend
echizen
stopped
there
as
long
as
he
could
but
went
away
at
last
then
everything
is
over
for
the
present
i
said
well
we
shall
be
able
to
find
him
out
in
the
next
three
years
i
suppose
three
years
is
a
long
time
but
this
council
at
kiôto
was
it
not
connected
with
the
latter
part
of
the
decree
giving
power
to
the
shôgun
to
conclude
treaties
where
the
mikado
says
are
points
in
the
existing
treaties
which
i
wish
you
to
rectify
in
concert
with
the
oh
no
said
saigô
you
are
quite
wrong
there
it
was
intended
as
i
have
said
before
that
the
should
consult
with
the
about
government
reforms
i
suppose
i
said
that
among
other
questions
for
discussion
the
chôshiû
affair
and
the
opening
of
hiôgo
were
included
what
is
the
position
with
regard
to
chôshiû
we
foreigners
can
not
comprehend
it
it
is
indeed
incomprehensible
saigô
replied
the
commenced
the
war
without
justification
and
they
have
stopped
it
equally
without
reason
is
it
peace
or
what
no
simply
that
hostilities
have
ceased
and
the
troops
have
been
withdrawn
there
the
matter
rests
for
us
foreigners
it
is
a
great
puzzle
why
the
attacked
chôshiû
at
all
it
was
certainly
not
because
he
had
fired
on
foreign
ships
if
he
really
had
offended
the
mikado
surely
your
prince
with
his
profound
affection
for
the
of
heaven
could
have
lent
assistance
i
believe
the
hated
chôshiû
all
along
replied
saigô
it
is
a
great
pity
the
council
did
not
take
place
because
it
is
of
the
highest
importance
that
the
affairs
of
the
country
should
come
to
a
settlement
within
this
year
we
have
a
treaty
with
japan
not
with
any
particular
person
and
we
do
intend
to
interfere
with
you
in
the
settlement
of
your
domestic
disputes
whether
japan
is
governed
by
the
mikado
or
the
or
becomes
a
confederation
of
separate
states
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
us
but
we
want
to
know
who
is
the
real
head
i
confess
to
you
that
we
have
serious
doubts
about
the
we
saw
that
they
are
not
supreme
or
rather
not
omnipotent
when
they
asked
us
to
let
them
off
the
opening
of
hiôgo
then
the
murder
of
richardson
and
the
impotence
of
the
to
punish
his
murderers
showed
us
that
their
authority
did
not
extend
as
far
as
satsuma
then
when
belonging
to
friendly
nations
were
fired
on
by
chôshiû
we
had
to
go
and
punish
him
because
the
could
not
do
it
and
we
see
now
that
chôshiû
has
got
the
best
of
the
late
war
these
things
make
us
doubt
the
supremacy
of
the
throughout
the
country
and
we
had
hoped
that
the
council
would
settle
the
difficulty
the
will
again
be
in
a
difficult
position
next
year
when
as
we
intend
to
do
we
demand
the
opening
of
hiôgo
if
the
oppose
it
my
master
does
not
oppose
the
opening
of
hiôgo
but
objects
to
its
being
opened
after
the
fashion
of
other
ports
we
want
it
to
be
opened
so
as
to
be
a
benefit
to
japan
and
not
solely
for
the
private
advantage
of
the
but
how
would
you
have
it
opened
i
asked
by
placing
all
questions
regarding
hiôgo
in
the
hands
of
a
committee
of
five
or
six
who
would
be
able
to
prevent
the
from
acting
exclusively
for
its
own
selfish
interests
hiôgo
is
very
important
to
us
we
all
owe
money
to
the
ozaka
merchants
and
we
have
to
send
the
productions
of
our
provinces
to
them
every
year
in
payment
of
our
debts
our
affairs
will
be
much
thrown
out
of
order
if
the
place
is
opened
on
the
same
plan
as
yokohama
i
see
now
why
you
attach
so
much
importance
to
hiôgo
it
is
your
last
card
it
is
a
great
pity
you
can
not
settle
all
your
internal
difficulties
before
the
port
is
opened
when
we
sent
yoshii
up
to
see
sir
harry
parkes
he
told
him
if
he
came
to
ozaka
to
ask
for
us
we
could
not
go
to
call
on
him
for
fear
of
incurring
suspicion
and
sir
harry
replied
that
he
would
ask
not
only
to
see
the
prince
of
satsuma
but
all
the
other
as
well
and
its
accompaniments
were
now
introduced
and
we
were
waited
on
by
a
girl
who
was
said
to
be
a
sweetheart
of
godai
saigô
excused
himself
and
retired
for
a
few
moments
with
my
companion
hayashi
who
was
apparently
a
confidential
agent
of
the
satsuma
people
after
the
second
course
as
he
seemed
in
a
hurry
to
get
away
i
rose
to
go
but
he
would
not
hear
of
my
leaving
so
early
i
begged
him
not
to
stand
on
ceremony
but
to
leave
whenever
he
chose
as
i
knew
he
had
a
long
way
to
go
after
a
few
minutes
more
he
rose
and
saying
in
case
sir
harry
wants
to
communicate
anything
to
us
he
has
only
to
send
a
message
to
our
house
at
yedo
and
we
will
despatch
anyone
he
likes
from
kiôto
to
see
him
he
took
his
departure
i
thanked
him
very
warmly
for
coming
so
far
to
see
me
and
we
bade
each
other
farewell
the
feast
was
resumed
and
after
numerous
courses
hayashi
and
i
went
back
on
board
the
argus
by
seven
next
day
we
left
for
yokohama
during
our
stay
at
hiôgo
we
had
walked
freely
about
the
town
and
found
the
people
perfectly
civil
they
were
evidently
becoming
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
foreigners
and
scarcely
took
any
notice
of
us
as
we
passed

the
streets

visit

on
reaching
yokohama
on
the
january
i
duly
made
my
report
to
the
chief
of
all
i
had
seen
heard
and
said
and
took
up
my
quarters
on
the
following
day
at
yedo
the
first
news
i
learnt
was
that
the
shôgun
had
invited
all
the
foreign
representatives
to
meet
him
at
ozaka
and
that
they
would
probably
accept
his
object
it
was
explained
was
to
break
through
all
the
traditions
of
the
past
eight
years
and
to
make
the
treaties
of
friendship
which
had
been
concluded
by
japan
with
foreign
countries
more
of
a
reality
than
they
had
hitherto
been
but
sir
harry
who
had
now
learnt
enough
of
the
internal
political
condition
to
convince
him
that
the
shôgun
power
was
fast
decaying
still
hesitated
and
it
was
only
when
he
found
a
majority
of
his
colleagues
determined
to
go
that
he
made
up
his
mind
to
join
them
but
he
persuaded
them
that
it
would
be
well
to
have
inquiries
made
beforehand
as
to
the
kind
of
accommodation
that
would
be
provided
and
consequently
deputed
mitford
and
myself
to
proceed
thither
in
the
argus

were
joined
by

the
of

a
couple
of
subordinate
officials

shôgun

department
had
accompanied
us
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
and
were
landed
at
once
to
provide
for
our
going

and
discussed
various
suitable
sites
for
a
foreign
settlement
they
also
conveyed
to
me
the
news
of
the
mikado
death
which
had
only
just
been
made
public
rumour
attributed
his
decease
to
smallpox
but
several
years
afterwards
i
was
assured
by
a
japanese
well
acquainted
with
what
went
on
behind
the
scenes
that
he
had
been
poisoned
he
was
by
conviction
utterly
opposed
to
any
concessions
to
foreigners
and
had
therefore
been
removed
out
of
the
way
by
those
who
foresaw
that
the
coming
downfall
of
the
would
force
the
court
into
direct
relations
with
western
powers
but
with
a
reactionary
mikado
nothing
but
difficulties
resulting
probably
in
war
was
to
be
expected
it
is
common
enough
in
eastern
countries
to
attribute
the
deaths
of
important
personages
to
poison
and
in
the
case
of
the
last
preceding
shôgun
rumours
had
been
pretty
rife
that
he
had
been
made
away
with
by
shitotsubashi
in
connexion
with
the
mikado
i
certainly
never
heard
any
such
suggestion
at
the
time
but
it
is
impossible
to
deny
that
his
disappearance
from
the
political
scene
leaving
as
his
successor
a
boy
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
of
age
was
most
opportune
noguchi
and
my
boy
yasu
turned
up
here
having
been
forwarded
from
uwajima
they
were
full
of
excuses
which
were
readily
admitted
we
got
away
on
the
morning
of
the
and
lieutenant
thalbitzer
a
danish
officer
from
the
argus
having
joined
us
we
were
a
party
of
four
ponies
had
been
provided
by
the
japanese
authorities
and
we
had
an
escort
of
nine
men
armed
with
swords
from
the
corps
which
supplied
the
guards
of
the
foreign
legations
at
yedo
our
steeds
were
small
and
untrained
but
each
had
a
splendid
running
footman
attached
to
it
who
kept
up
the
pace
in
magnificent
style
troops
had
been
posted
along
the
road
for
our
protection
and
the
whole
number
thus
detailed
can
not
have
been
less
than
this
gave
us
a
novel
and
somewhat
embarrassing
sense
of
importance
the
road
is
perfectly
flat
the
whole
way
and
fairly
straight
until
it
approaches
ozaka
when
it
begins
to
make
which
lengthened
it
unnecessarily
this
plan
was
formerly
adopted
nearly
all
over
japan
in
the
vicinity
of
towns
for
strategical
purposes
as
the
roads
nearly
always
run
through
the
swampy
rice
fields
a
hostile
force
is
unable
to
march
straight
at
its
point
of
attack
but
must
follow
the
road
being
thus
constantly
exposed
to
a
flank
fire
from
the
defending
force
occupying
the
other
arm
of
the
angle
ahead
soon
after
passing
we
came
in
sight
of
the
castle
of
ozaka
a
conspicuous
object
in
the
landscape
by
its
shining
white
walls
and
towers
visible
for
many
a
league
at
last
we
reached
the
city
although
our
guides
missed
the
route
at
first
and
here
and
there
a
break
occurred
in
the
troops
which
lined
the
narrow
streets
the
crowd
quietly
made
way
for
us
and
stood
in
front
of
the
houses
without
uttering
a
sound
at
every
corner
there
was
an
immense
concourse
and
the
were
filled
with
eager
gazing
faces
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
we
crossed
the
great
wooden
bridge
over
the
river
which
runs
through
the
city
turned
to
the
left
along
the
embankment
and
bending
again
to
the
right
proceeded
down
a
long
apparently
interminable
street
until
we
finally
reached
our
lodgings
at
the
monastery
here
we
found
some
officials
of
the
foreign
department
and
received
calls
from
a
few
of
the
local
functionaries
everything
had
been
done
to
make
us
comfortable
and
the
locality
was
the
best
that
could
have
been
selected
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
contrasting
this
generous
hospitality
with
the
reluctant
almost
hostile
reception
accorded
to
us
on
the
occasion
of
our
visit
in
the
times
had
evidently
changed
since
the
accession
of
the
new
shôgun
and
the
recent
death
of
the
mikado
did
not
appear
to
have
made
any
difference
in
his
plans
and
intentions
for
the
of
a
conciliatory
policy
preparations
had
been
made
by
the
officials
for
our
accommodation
to
the
best
of
their
ability
after
washing
off
the
dust
of
our
long
ride
in
a
comfortable
bathroom
we
sat
down
to
a
dinner
served
in
imitation
of
western
fashion
with
french
wines
including
an
excellent
bottle
of
larose
alas
it
was
the
only
one
the
seats
however
were
mere
wooden
stools
and
i
suffered
a
good
deal
from
them
during
our
stay
afterwards
we
inspected
the
bedrooms
the
bedsteads
were
mere
makeshifts
but
there
was
a
plentiful
supply
of
bedding
consisting
of
cotton
quilts
and
stuffed
silk
coverlets
the
toilet
service
was
made
up
of
two
ludicrously
small
basins
and
underneath
the
toilet
table
a
huge
water
pot
at
the
side
were
a
cake
of
almond
soap
and
a
bottle
of
but
what
seemed
especially
unusual
was
the
deference
of
manner
and
language
exhibited
by
all
the
officials
with
whom
we
came
in
contact
hitherto
i
had
experienced
only
familiarity
approaching
to
rudeness
at
the
hands
of
government
officers
on
the
following
morning
we
were
visited
by
suzuki
an
official
of
the
uwajima
clan
who
came
with
a
message
from
the
resident
to
beg
that
we
would
not
visit
them
at
their
but
at
the
same
time
he
managed
to
convey
the
contrary
impression
i
sent
noguchi
to
the
satsuma
to
invite
komatsu
to
call
on
us
and
to
that
of
uwajima
to
convey
my
thanks
for
the
kindness
exhibited
to
my
two
servants
in
the
afternoon
we
went
out
for
a
walk
in
the
suji
which
is
the
principal
street
of
the
city
preceded
by
a
small
band
of
men
who
emitted
a
cry
like
a
crow
to
warn
the
people
out
of
the
way
dense
crowds
hovered
on
our
footsteps
eager
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
strangers
for
no
europeans
had
been
in
ozaka
since
the
last
dutch
mission
from
nagasaki
had
passed
through
a
few
years
before
we
were
no
less
inquisitive
and
made
a
great
round
past
all
the
booksellers
and
mercers
shops
till
dark
our
next
visitor
was
yoshii
kôsuké
whom
i
have
already
mentioned
he
reminded
me
that
we
had
met
at
hiôgo
in
the
autumn
of
on
board
the
steamer
when
i
had
also
seen
saigô
for
the
first
time
yoshii
was
a
little
man
very
vivacious
and
talked
with
a
perfect
satsuma
brogue
every
day
we
spent
the
greater
part
of
our
time
in
and
the
officials
proved
obliging
in
every
way
we
had
only
to
express
a
wish
and
it
was
immediately
gratified
in
a
day
or
two
we
got
komatsu
and
yoshii
to
tiffin
the
former
was
one
of
the
most
charming
japanese
i
have
known
a
karô
by
birth
but
unlike
most
of
that
class
distinguished
for
his
political
ability
excellent
manners
and
a
genial
companion
he
had
a
fairer
complexion
than
most
but
his
large
mouth
prevented
his
being
they
partook
heartily
of
pâte
de
foie
gras
and
pale
ale
and
at
last
became
so
merry
that
we
feared
they
might
make
indiscreet
revelations
in
the
presence
of
the
tokugawa
servants
who
crowded
the
house
on
the
next
day
mitford
and
i
returned
their
visit
at
the
satsuma
or
produce
agency
near
the
river
bank
yoshii
received
us
at
the
door
and
ushered
us
into
a
room
where
we
found
komatsu
the
agent
and
matsuki
kôwan
the
latter
was
one
of
the
two
prisoners
taken
by
us
in
and
i
had
some
suspicion
that
he
was
not
altogether
to
be
trusted
as
he
was
reported
to
have
been
in
the
tycoon
service
during
the
interval
so
after
the
exchange
of
compliments
i
suggested
that
we
might
have
some
more
private
talk
it
was
a
mistake
on
my
part
however
matsuki
afterwards
changed
his
name
to
terashima
tôzô
or
perhaps
merely
reassumed
it
and
held
office
pretty
constantly
since
the
revolution
of
chiefly
in
connexion
with
foreign
affairs
so
komatsu
yoshii
mitford
and
i
retired
together
into
an
inner
room
they
told
us
that
the
mikado
death
had
taken
place
on
the
january
though
the
date
officially
announced
was
the
february
he
had
been
succeeded
by
his
son
a
youth
of
fifteen
who
it
was
thought
had
in
him
the
makings
of
a
clever
man
if
properly
educated
in
foreign
and
domestic
politics
but
unfortunately
the
would
not
allow
him
to
be
approached
by
any
teachers
who
could
improve
his
mind
during
the
new
mikado
youth
the
conduct
of
public
affairs
would
be
carried
on
in
his
name
by
the
kwambaku
best
rendered
vizier
this
officer
is
chosen
from
one
of
five
noble
court
families
nominally
of
course
by
the
mikado
but
in
reality
by
the
tycoon
and
principal
the
present
kwambaku
was
a
wise
and
good
man
but
too
much
disposed
to
listen
to
the
counsels
of
the
they
thought
the
new
shôgun
idea
in
inviting
the
foreign
representatives
to
ozaka
was
merely
a
counter
move
to
the
invitations
which
sir
harry
parkes
had
accepted
from
the
of
satsuma
and
uwajima
the
shôgun
would
probably
talk
a
great
deal
about
drawing
closer
the
bonds
of
friendship
but
would
avoid
treating
about
the
opening
of
hiôgo
the
in
fact
did
not
wish
that
event
to
take
place
because
it
would
let
a
flood
of
light
into
the
minds
of
the
mikado
and
the
court
nobles
komatsu
said
he
had
remonstrated
with
the
for
delaying
to
hand
over
the
land
at
hiôgo
and
postponing
the
notification
of
the
tariff
convention
of
last
june
their
answer
being
that
they
had
not
yet
made
up
their
minds
on
those
subjects
satsuma
he
said
had
purchased
some
land
near
kôbé
as
a
site
for
a
of
which
they
would
be
willing
to
let
us
have
the
greater
portion
for
a
foreign
settlement
satsuma
wished
to
see
the
place
opened
to
foreign
trade
but
wanted
it
to
be
done
in
a
proper
manner
many
of
the
court
nobles
were
also
in
favour
of
the
measure
these
were
men
of
liberal
tendencies
but
not
in
favour
with
the
who
had
imprisoned
some
of
them
they
were
not
allowed
to
have
access
to
the
mikado
affairs
being
in
a
critical
condition
it
was
probable
that
the
shôgun
would
stop
a
long
time
at
kiôto
were
he
to
return
to
yedo
he
would
lose
his
hold
over
the
mikado
and
chôshiû
might
make
another
dash
at
the
palace
none
of
the
had
proceeded
specially
to
kiôto
for
the
investiture
of
the
shôgun
the
absent
ones
being
represented
by
their
agents
komatsu
begged
us
to
tell
sir
harry
that
it
was
not
the
desire
of
satsuma
and
the
other
who
acted
with
him
to
upset
the
but
simply
to
restrain
them
from
misusing
their
powers
they
hoped
however
to
see
the
mikado
restored
to
his
ancient
position
as
ruler
of
the
country
all
the
plans
and
hopes
of
satsuma
tended
to
the
benefit
of
the
country
and
not
to
a
revolution
against
the
shôgun
if
sir
harry
on
his
arrival
would
propose
to
make
a
treaty
with
the
mikado
the
would
at
once
give
in
their
adhesion
and
flock
to
kiôto
in
order
to
take
part
in
carrying
out
the
great
scheme
all
that
was
necessary
was
for
him
to
help
them
to
this
extent
and
they
would
do
the
rest
the
conversation
had
now
lasted
so
long
that
we
thought
it
best
to
break
off
for
fear
of
exciting
suspicion
and
we
returned
to
the
other
room
where
a
capital
japanese
luncheon
was
spread
out
to
my
great
surprise
we
were
joined
by
inouyé
bunda
whom
i
had
not
seen
since
the
bombardment
of
shimonoséki
his
face
was
now
disfigured
by
a
huge
scar
the
vestige
of
one
of
several
wounds
which
he
had
received
in
the
course
of
a
party
fight
down
in
chôshiû
he
said
his
people
had
now
got
the
steam
up
and
would
like
to
give
the
shôgun
another
thrashing
he
brought
a
message
from
the
prince
to
sir
harry
inviting
him
to
visit
the
province
at
the
earliest
opportunity
when
sir
harry
last
passed
through
shimonoséki
he
said
the
french
minister
was
there
and
that
accident
had
prevented
an
intended
interview
the
satsuma
people
expressed
the
hope
that
mitford
and
i
would
visit
kagoshima
as
soon
as
possible
we
had
a
discussion
with
shibata
hiûga
no
kami
one
of
the
commissioners
for
foreign
affairs
about
sir
harry
public
entry
into
ozaka
and
settled
all
the
details
quietly
and
amicably
but
when
we
came
to
the
ceremony
of
presentation
to
the
shôgun
some
difficulties
cropped
up
he
wanted
the
british
minister
to
make
his
bow
outside
the
room
in
which
the
shôgun
would
be
and
we
could
not
allow
this
our
object
was
to
insist
on
the
forms
being
as
like
those
of
european
courts
as
possible
noguchi
as
i
have
said
belonged
to
the
aidzu
clan
which
furnished
the
best
part
of
the
shogun
fighting
force
at
kiôto
i
had
sent
him
there
to
see
his
people
and
he
returned
with
the
news
that
some
were
coming
down
to
call
on
me
accordingly
late
in
the
evening
of
the
four
of
them
appeared
named
kajiwara
heima
a
kurazawa
uhei
yamada
teisuké
and
kawara
zenzayemon
bearing
as
presents
rolls
of
light
blue
silk
damask
and
lists
of
swords
and
other
articles
to
be
hereafter
given
to
sir
harry
mitford
and
myself
in
making
official
presents
the
custom
was
that
a
list
written
on
thick
light
paper
called
should
accompany
the
articles
and
often
if
these
were
not
ready
the
list
was
handed
over
beforehand
we
had
nothing
to
give
in
return
but
entertained
them
to
the
best
of
our
ability
kajiwara
in
particular
distinguished
himself
by
drinking
champagne
whiskey
sherry
rum
gin
and
gin
and
water
without
blinking
or
shrinking
he
was
a
particularly
handsome
young
fellow
with
a
fair
complexion
and
had
perfect
manners
we
gave
them
a
letter
of
introduction
to
captain
hewett
of
the
basilisk
as
they
wanted
to
see
a
foreign
this
was
the
foundation
of
a
close
friendship
between
myself
and
the
aidzu
clan
which
survived
the
war
of
the
revolution
and
the
completest
possible
difference
of
opinion
on
japanese
internal
politics
but
they
never
resented
the
part
we
took
clearly
seeing
that
all
the
english
wanted
was
the
good
of
the
japanese
as
a
nation
and
that
they
were
not
partisans
of
any
faction
our
new
friends
came
a
couple
of
days
later
to
tiffin
when
they
were
regaled
with
champagne
and
preserved
meats
greatly
to
the
elevation
of
their
spirits
it
ought
to
be
noted
that
in
those
days
it
was
quite
the
proper
thing
to
get
drunk
at
a
dinner
party
and
a
host
whose
guests
went
away
sober
would
have
been
mortified
by
a
feeling
that
his
hospitality
had
not
been
properly
appreciated
one
of
them
got
very
tight
and
began
to
talk
things
unfit
for
the
ears
of
boys
or
maidens
while
another
produced
a
packet
of
indecent
pictures
which
he
generously
distributed
among
the
four
of
us
in
return
for
this
entertainment
kajiwara
invited
us
to
go
and
drink
with
him
in
the
evening
we
at
once
accepted
but
had
some
trouble
with
the
foreign
department
officials
from
yedo
to
whom
it
appeared
an
improper
violation
of
all
precedent
for
members
of
a
foreign
legation
to
attend
a
feast
given
by
a
man
even
though
the
belonged
to
the
shôgun
party
we
could
therefore
trust
them
to
make
every
effort
behind
our
backs
to
prevent
the
entertainment
coming
off

the
afternoon
was
spent
in
visiting
the
boats
in
which
it
was
proposed
to
bring
the
british
minister
and
his
suite
to
the
temporary
legation
and
a
long
weary
tramp
of
it
we
had
but
at
last
we
got
to
the
place
where
they
would
leave
the
boats
embarking
here
we
made
an
experimental
trip
ourselves
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
not
do
to
begin
with
the
distance
was
very
great
and
poling
against
the
stream
was
a
slow
method
of
progression
next
instead
of
showing
themselves
to
the
populace
the
minister
and
his
staff
would
be
almost
hidden
from
view
and
would
be
taken
through
a
succession
of
narrow
obscure
and
not
very
clean
canals
to
a
very
short
distance
from
their
lodgings
to
which
they
would
have
to
proceed
on
foot
we
found
a
dense
crowd
had
collected
at
the
to
see
us
although
it
was
quite
dark
we
had
been
more
than
a
week
in
the
city
and
the
curiosity
of
the
inhabitants
seemed
not
a
whit
abated
though
we
had
traversed
the
city
in
all
directions
and
not
a
day
passed
without
our
taking
a
long
walk
noguchi
who
had
gone
with
the
aidzu
men
to
find
out
where
the
symposium
was
to
be
held
was
not
yet
back
so
reconciling
ourselves
to
the
idea
that
the
officials
had
succeeded
in
putting
it
off
we
sat
down
to
a
dinner
of
terrapin
soup
and
boiled
terrapins
in
the
middle
of
it
however
noguchi
appeared
to
announce
that
all
was
ready
the
guard
that
usually
dogged
our
steps
when
we
went
out
had
all
retired
to
rest
for
the
night
so
we
got
away
unaccompanied
except
by
one
man
carrying
a
lantern
the
streets
were
by
this
time
quite
deserted
and
we
hugged
ourselves
with
the
consciousness
of
an
adventure
no
european
had
yet
been
abroad
in
the
streets
of
a
japanese
city
at
night
as
a
free
man
we
had
to
walk
a
couple
of
miles
and
then
turn
down
by
the
river
till
we
came
to
a
house
close
to
the
great
bridge
here
we
found
our
friends
awaiting
our
arrival
blankets
were
spread
for
us
on
the
floor
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
while
the
aidzu
men
sat
on
cushions
opposite
to
us
a
row
of
tall
candlesticks
occupying
the
centre
tea
was
served
by
some
very
ancient
females
and
we
began
again
to
fear
a
disappointment
for
the
invitation
had
been
accompanied
by
a
promise
to
show
us
some
of
the
most
celebrated
singing
and
dancing
girls
of
the
city
however
when
the
was
brought
up
they
descended
from
the
upper
storey
where
they
had
been
engaged
in
completing
their
toilette
some
of
them
were
certainly
pretty
others
decidedly
ugly
but
we
thought
their
looks
ruined
in
any
case
by
the
blackened
teeth
and
faces
in
later
times
i
became
more
accustomed
to
the
shining
black
teeth
which
were
then
the
distinctive
mark
of
a
married
woman
as
well
as
of
every
artiste
old
enough
to
have
an
admirer
so
much
so
that
when
the
empress
set
the
fashion
by
discontinuing
the
practice
it
was
long
before
i
in
common
with
most
japanese
could
reconcile
myself
to
the
new
style
i
have
always
thought
japanese
dancing
or
rather
posturing
extremely
uninteresting
it
is
a
sort
of
interpreting
by
more
or
less
graceful
or
as
one
may
look
at
it
affected
movements
of
body
and
limbs
of
the
words
of
a
song
chanted
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
kind
of
lute
it
is
some
help
to
know
the
words
of
the
song
beforehand
they
are
no
more
comprehensible
when
sung
than
the
sounds
given
forth
by
the
singers
in
italian
opera
are
to
the
majority
of
their
audience
but
no
foreigner
unless
he
be
an
enthusiast
would
ever
take
the
trouble
to
educate
himself
to
appreciate
this
form
of
art
he
can
enjoy
the
beautiful
in
other
ways
at
much
less
cost
of
time
and
mental
exertion
then
it
takes
a
long
apprenticeship
to
accustom
the
european
ear
to
music
constructed
with
a
set
of
intervals
that
are
different
enough
from
ours
to
make
of
the
notes
seem
out
of
tune
this
form
of
entertainment
is
universal
all
over
the
east
in
india
burma
siam
china
and
japan
with
local
variations
and
is
to
my
uncultivated
taste
everywhere
equally
tedious
our
yedo
officials
had
found
us
out
and
did
not
cease
to
urge
our
return
until
at
eleven
we
gave
way
to
their
importunity
and
said
to
our
hosts
after
only
a
short
stay
i
daresay
they
kept
it
up
to
a
much
later
hour
this
was
the
evening
before
we
left
ozaka
chapter
xvii
reception
of
foreign
ministers
by
the
tycoon
on
our
return
to
yedo
we
were
horrified
to
learn
of
the
death
by
his
own
hand
of
poor
vidal
the
junior
student
interpreter
no
motive
was
assignable
for
the
terrible
act
except
insane
he
certainly
was
not
a
more
lucid
intellect
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
he
had
abilities
of
a
very
high
order
but
was
a
prey
to
a
torpid
liver
which
seemed
always
to
embitter
his
existence
his
first
nomination
was
to
siam
but
before
he
had
taken
up
his
appointment
he
was
transferred
to
peking
after
a
year
or
two
there
finding
the
climate
did
not
suit
him
he
obtained
a
change
to
japan
but
even
there
he
was
not
content
with
his
lot
and
preferred
annihilation
the
next
few
days
were
spent
in
visiting
atami
and
hakoné
in
company
with
some
friends
from
yokohama
there
is
nothing
worthy
of
record
about
this
excursion
except
that
atami
which
then
contained
only
a
couple
of
hotels
now
possesses
at
least
a
dozen
and
has
become
a
fashionable
winter
resort
much
frequented
by
the
higher
classes
living
in
tôkiô
yedo
the
cost
of
transport
then
was
much
less
than
it
would
be
now
we
paid
the
coolies
who
carried
our
baggage
over
to
hakoné
a
distance
of
about
ten
miles
about
shillings
and
per
man
at
that
time
there
existed
a
barrier
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
village
at
which
all
travellers
had
to
exhibit
their
passports
to
the
men
on
guard
the
at
the
guardhouse
among
other
provisions
stated
that
dead
bodies
wounded
persons
and
individuals
of
suspicious
aspect
were
not
allowed
to
proceed
without
the
production
of
a
passport
a
lady
of
our
party
accomplished
the
difficult
feat
of
riding
on
a
japanese
pony
down
the
steep
and
badly
paved
road
which
descends
from
the
top
of
the
pass
to
odawara
we
established
ourselves
in
the
official
inn
where
we
were
received
with
due
respect
and
cordiality
by
the
innkeeper
it
was
a
building
spread
over
a
considerable
area
and
containing
ten
or
fifteen
rooms
of
the
regulation
size
namely
feet
square
besides
a
huge
kitchen
and
an
entrance
hall
here
we
passed
the
night
and
on
the
following
day
noguchi
procured
for
us
packhorses
and
coolies
at
the
government
rates
which
were
horse
load
cash
coolie
load
cash
for
a
distance
of
ten
miles
now
cash
were
equal
to
one
that
is
four
or
at
par
rates
about
so
that
the
official
rate
for
the
coolie
was
about
two
and
a
fifth
pence
for
the
whole
distance
or
a
little
over
the
of
a
penny
per
mile
the
coolies
were
obliged
to
perform
the
labour
as
corvée
and
if
they
were
not
in
sufficient
number
the
population
of
the
post
towns
had
to
hire
men
at
ordinary
rates
to
let
them
out
at
the
government
tariff
it
was
a
heavy
tax
and
one
of
the
first
reforms
of
the
new
government
established
after
the
revolution
was
the
abolition
of
this
system
at
hodogaya
i
parted
from
the
rest
of
the
party
who
returned
to
yokohama
and
went
on
to
kanagawa
where
i
slept
at
the
or
official
hotel
occupying
the
best
rooms
which
were
reserved
for
and
high
officials
of
the
government
i
rode
in
a
or
palanquin
from
hodogaya
just
five
miles
and
was
two
hours
accomplishing
that
short
distance
it
was
however
the
ordinary
rate
of
travelling
in
those
days
one
of
the
native
legation
guard
went
ahead
also
in
a
preceded
by
a
big
bamboo
and
paper
lantern
on
a
pole
then
came
my
followed
by
a
coolie
carrying
my
baggage
in
a
couple
of
wicker
boxes
slung
on
a
pole
and
a
second
guardsman
noguchi
probably
walked
next
morning
when
i
came
to
discharge
the
bill
for
my
whole
party
including
rooms
and
supper
and
breakfast
i
found
it
amounted
to
about
and
i
gave
one
say
to
the
hotelkeeper
as
or
tea
money
which
was
considered
quite
enough
in
japan
the
charge
for
a
night
lodging
called
used
to
include
everything
rice
tea
sleeping
accommodation
fuel
candles
and
use
of
the
hot
bath
the
only
extras
were
and
which
a
traveller
ordered
for
the
good
of
the
house
but
if
he
was
of
an
economical
turn
he
contented
himself
with
the
regular
two
meals
which
were
quite
enough
to
satisfy
his
appetite
fish
is
more
played
with
than
eaten
and
is
merely
the
excuse
for
the
comparison
with
a
european
hotel
bill
with
its
charges
for
candles
firing
and
bath
is
striking
moreover
in
japan
you
give
no
tips
for
none
are
expected
and
the
tea
money
takes
the
place
of
the
charge
for
the
room
you
occupy
it
was
after
my
return
from
this
journey
that
mitford
and
i
removed
to
a
little
house
outside
the
legation
situated
in
a
pretty
garden
on
the
rising
ground
which
overhangs
the
side
road
leading
from
the
tôkaidô
to
it
was
in
reality
a
small
monastery
named
and
we
occupied
the
guest
apartments
having
each
a
bedroom
and
one
sitting
room
no
palisade
surrounded
it
and
our
only
protection
was
a
hut
at
the
gate
which
held
three
or
four
of
the
we
thought
ourselves
very
plucky
in
thus
braving
the
risks
of
midnight
assassination
when
the
legation
grounds
below
us
were
patrolled
all
night
and
sentries
passed
the
word
to
each
other
as
the
hours
struck
here
we
spent
several
months
together
living
entirely
on
japanese
food
which
was
brought
three
times
a
day
from
a
restaurant
known
as
much
frequented
by
our
friends
the
satsuma
men
mitford
devoted
himself
with
unflagging
diligence
to
the
study
of
the
japanese
language
as
he
had
before
at
peking
to
that
of
the
chinese
and
made
rapid
progress
i
began
to
compile
for
his
use
a
series
of
sentences
and
dialogues
which
some
years
afterwards
were
published
under
the
title
of
hen
it
was
convenient
to
be
outside
the
legation
compound
because
i
could
receive
visits
from
the
retainers
of
without
obstruction
i
used
to
go
a
good
deal
to
the
satsuma
in
mita
to
get
political
information
from
two
men
named
shibayama
riôsuké
and
nambu
yahachirô
the
former
met
his
death
towards
the
close
of
the
year
in
a
remarkable
manner
the
having
gained
evil
repute
as
the
refuge
of
a
number
of
and
other
disorderly
political
characters
was
surrounded
and
set
on
fire
by
the
police
there
was
a
fight
many
were
killed
but
shibayama
was
made
prisoner
when
brought
up
for
examination
he
boldly
avowed
that
he
had
been
the
ringleader
and
then
drawing
a
pistol
from
the
bosom
of
his
dress
shot
himself
through
the
head
he
was
a
capital
companion
and
i
had
more
than
one
agreeable
adventure
with
him
towards
the
middle
of
april
the
foreign
diplomatic
representatives
moved
in
a
body
down
to
ozaka
the
french
minister
roches
had
already
been
there
in
march
in
furtherance
of
the
special
line
of
policy
he
was
pursuing
and
seen
the
shôgun
doubtless
promises
of
support
had
been
given
at
any
rate
counsel
had
been
offered
in
fact
as
it
afterwards
turned
out
roches
so
far
committed
himself
with
the
that
he
found
it
impossible
to
remain
one
day
longer
in
japan
after
its
final
overthrow
on
our
side
sir
harry
parkes
was
resolved
henceforth
to
treat
the
shôgun
as
of
no
more
importance
than
a
henceforward
he
was
styled
by
us
his
highness
while
for
the
queen
we
used
a
japanese
title
placing
her
on
full
equality
with
the
mikado
sir
harry
took
with
him
to
ozaka
the
mounted
escort
under
captain
applin
and
a
detachment
of
men
from
the
commanded
by
captain
daunt
and
lieutenant
bradshaw
lady
parkes
was
also
of
the
party
the
staff
consisted
of
the
secretary
of
legation
sidney
locock
mitford
myself
i
was
acting
japanese
secretary
willis
aston
and
wilkinson
we
had
persuaded
sir
harry
to
let
charles
wirgman
come
with
us
we
numbered
about
seventy
europeans
besides
some
thirty
chinese
and
japanese
writers
servants
and
grooms
the
tycoon
government
furnished
all
the
fresh
supplies
required
great
offence
was
caused
by
this
exclusive
privilege
and
rickerby
in
the
japan
times
poured
out
his
wrath
upon
the
head
of
our
friend
the
artist
it
was
perhaps
not
an
unreasonable
complaint
from
their
point
of
view
that
no
representatives
of
the
mercantile
community
were
invited
to
accompany
the
foreign
ministers
but
it
is
quite
certain
that
they
would
have
been
very
much
in
the
way
the
british
legation
occupied
four
spacious
temples
or
monasteries
at
the
further
end
of
a
street
called
the
other
representatives
being
accommodated
in
perhaps
somewhat
inferior
buildings
nearer
to
its
entrance
but
the
british
minister
had
taken
the
trouble
to
send
down
two
of
his
staff
beforehand
to
make
all
the
arrangements
while
the
others
were
ready
to
be
contented
with
what
was
provided
for
them
by
the
japanese
government
mitford
wirgman
and
i
occupied
one
end
of
a
temple
overlooking
the
city
while
at
the
other
end
were
sir
harry
office
and
the
temporary
chancery
the
whole
mission
messed
together
in
the
temple
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
where
sir
harry
and
lady
parkes
had
their
abode
next
door
was
a
temple
given
up
to
the
officers
of
the
guard
and
two
student
interpreters
and
the
fourth
was
set
apart
for
guests
i
had
a
charming
set
of
rooms
on
three
floors
the
bottom
was
occupied
by
the
japanese
writers
and
my
retainers
the
centre
floor
consisting
of
two
rooms
served
as
a
bedroom
and
office
and
the
top
was
a
sort
of
parlour
where
i
received
guests
only
twelve
feet
by
nine
but
large
enough
to
accommodate
a
dozen
persons
as
it
did
not
contain
a
single
piece
of
furniture
it
was
a
busy
time
i
was
employed
from
morning
till
night
translating
and
interpreting
and
remember
that
on
one
occasion
i
had
to
talk
japanese
for
eleven
successive
hours
as
the
chief
had
japanese
guests
both
at
luncheon
and
dinner
for
this
reason
i
found
no
time
to
keep
my
journal
and
what
follows
is
a
pure
effort
of
memory
aided
only
as
far
as
the
dates
are
concerned
by
reference
to
printed
sources
a
great
part
of
our
time
was
taken
up
with
the
regulations
under
which
settlements
were
to
be
formed
at
hiôgo
and
ozaka
the
conditions
under
which
land
was
to
be
leased
to
foreigners
and
the
creation
of
a
municipality
at
each
place
and
sir
harry
being
the
most
practical
man
among
the
whole
body
of
foreign
representatives
the
work
fell
in
the
main
on
his
shoulders
the
japanese
government
were
evidently
desirous
of
conciliating
the
representatives
and
the
negotiations
proceeded
with
unaccustomed
smoothness
and
celerity
no
more
angry
discussions
and
heated
arguments
in
which
the
heat
and
anger
of
our
chief
were
opposed
to
the
stolid
calm
of
the
imperturbable
japanese
ministers
such
as
had
characterized
our
official
interviews
at
yedo
at
the
word
of
the
new
shôgun
an
entirely
new
line
had
been
adopted
and
a
serious
endeavour
was
made
to
convert
the
treaty
of
friendship
into
a
reality
then
we
had
visits
from
satsuma
awa
and
uwajima
men
and
tried
to
ascertain
what
was
likely
to
be
the
of
the
political
movement
that
had
been
in
progress
now
for
thirteen
years
but
on
the
whole
everything
seemed
to
point
to
the
triumph
of
the
shôgun
over
his
opponents
and
one
of
the
principal
objects
with
which
he
had
invited
the
foreign
ministers
to
ozaka
was
that
he
might
make
their
personal
acquaintance
and
thus
manifest
his
desire
to
cultivate
friendly
relations
with
foreign
countries
who
put
this
into
his
head
i
do
not
know
but
it
does
not
seem
unlikely
that
a
closer
intimacy
with
the
legations
had
been
suggested
to
him
by
one
of
the
representatives
themselves
a
good
deal
of
time
was
consumed
in
discussing
the
etiquette
to
be
observed
at
the
audiences
of
the
shôgun
but
in
the
end
it
was
arranged
that
it
should
be
entirely
according
to
european
fashion
the
first
interview
was
a
private
one
sir
harry
proceeded
to
the
castle
on
horseback
accompanied
by
all
the
members
of
the
mission
preceded
by
the
mounted
escort
and
with
a
detachment
of
the
infantry
guard
before
and
behind
a
cloud
of
the
japanese
guard
called
hovered
on
our
flanks
and
kept
back
the
crowd
a
rather
ludicrous
incident
was
the
presentation
of
arms
by
the
soldiers
who
lined
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
castle
to
the
officer
in
command
of
the
escort
whose
resplendent
uniform
had
led
them
to
mistake
him
for
the
minister
at
the
nearer
end
of
the
causeway
crossing
the
moat
there
used
to
stand
a
wooden
board
inscribed
with
the
chinese
characters
for
alight
from
horseback
but
as
had
been
agreed
upon
beforehand
we
took
no
notice
of
this
and
passed
on
through
the
gateway
to
the
very
door
of
the
palace
if
i
recollect
rightly
this
was
almost
close
to
the
gate
the
palace
unfortunately
exists
no
longer
having
been
destroyed
by
fire
during
the
retreat
of
the
defeated
forces
early
in
february
but
it
was
reputed
to
be
the
most
splendid
example
of
domestic
architecture
then
extant
in
japan
it
certainly
was
far
superior
to
the
mikado
palace
at
kiôto
wide
and
lofty
matted
corridors
partitioned
off
by
painted
screens
of
choice
cryptomeria
wood
ran
along
the
front
of
a
succession
of
large
rooms
and
away
to
the
right
by
the
side
of
the
three
large
apartments
constituting
the
or
hall
of
audience
the
other
apartments
had
each
a
specific
name
and
the
were
classified
according
to
their
right
of
waiting
in
one
or
the
other
for
their
turn
of
admission
to
the
presence
over
these
wooden
screens
were
large
panels
of
carved
wood
representing
birds
and
animals
surrounded
by
foliage
but
somewhat
too
richly
painted
very
much
in
the
style
familiar
to
those
who
have
visited
the
mausoleum
of
iyéyasu
at
nikkô
we
were
conducted
along
the
matted
corridor
by
the
commissioners
for
foreign
affairs
who
had
some
difficulty
in
walking
as
the
court
rules
prescribed
their
wearing
long
wide
trousers
that
extended
far
beyond
their
feet
so
as
to
give
them
the
appearance
of
moving
on
their
knees
until
we
reached
the
further
room
where
the
shôgun
was
awaiting
us
he
shook
hands
with
sir
harry
and
sat
down
at
the
head
of
a
long
table
with
sir
harry
on
his
right
and
on
his
left
itakura
iga
no
kami
who
might
be
styled
prime
minister
the
rest
of
the
staff
sat
next
to
sir
harry
and
i
had
a
stool
between
him
and
the
shôgun
he
was
one
of
the
most
japanese
i
have
ever
seen
of
fair
complexion
with
a
high
forehead
and
nose
such
a
gentleman
i
felt
somewhat
nervous
not
knowing
whether
i
had
got
hold
of
the
forms
of
speech
required
by
court
etiquette
and
remember
making
a
ridiculous
blunder
over
an
observation
of
sir
harry
that
all
that
was
disagreeable
in
the
past
relations
of
great
britain
and
japan
was
now
forgotten
there
was
no
business
talk
on
this
occasion
and
after
the
conversation
was
over
the
whole
company
adjourned
to
a
smaller
apartment
where
dinner
was
served
in
european
style
the
shôgun
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
was
very
gracious
round
the
walls
hung
paintings
of
the
poets
and
sir
harry
having
admired
them
the
shôgun
made
him
a
present
of
one
whiskey
and
water
were
produced
after
the
repast
and
i
had
the
honour
of
brewing
toddy
for
the
great
man
it
was
dark
when
we
left
a
few
days
later
there
was
a
formal
audience
at
which
the
captains
of
the
were
presented
we
had
arranged
beforehand
the
address
of
sir
harry
and
the
reply
of
the
shôgun
who
had
been
tutored
also
into
saying
a
few
words
to
each
person
presented
to
him
these
somewhat
resembled
the
turkish
pasha
remarks
as
translated
by
the
dragoman
at
the
famous
interview
described
in
to
captain
haswell
who
had
been
on
a
polar
expedition
for
instance
he
said
what
really
amounted
to
you
had
a
long
journey
but
was
interpreted
in
much
more
complimentary
style
i
remember
receiving
a
visit
from
saigô
and
others
of
that
party
who
were
not
at
all
pleased
at
the
between
us
and
the
shôgun
i
hinted
to
saigô
that
the
chance
of
a
revolution
was
not
to
be
lost
if
hiôgo
were
once
opened
then
to
the
chances
of
the
the
street
in
which
the
foreign
representatives
lodged
was
shut
in
at
each
end
by
solid
wooden
gates
at
which
a
number
of
the
were
stationed
on
guard
day
and
night
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
out
into
the
city
without
an
escort
as
the
guard
had
instructions
to
follow
us
wherever
we
went
this
was
very
irksome
to
mitford
and
myself
until
we
found
out
a
gap
in
the
wall
which
surrounded
one
of
the
temples
and
from
that
time
we
used
to
make
nocturnal
excursions
to
all
parts
of
the
town
accompanied
by
my
retainer
noguchi
the
sense
of
a
certain
peril
to
be
encountered
combined
with
a
sort
of
truant
schoolboy
feeling
rendered
these
explorations
into
the
night
life
of
japan
very
enjoyable
on
one
occasion
young
matsuné
joined
us
on
an
expedition
to
the
quarter
occupied
by
singing
and
dancing
girls
it
was
a
moonlight
night
and
the
chance
of
detection
by
the
guard
was
so
much
the
greater
after
getting
through
our
gap
we
doubled
back
and
passing
behind
the
legations
got
into
a
lower
street
running
parallel
to
that
in
which
we
lived
where
we
ran
along
for
some
distance
keeping
close
in
the
shadow
of
the
houses
then
darted
into
another
street
at
right
angles
turned
to
the
right
again
until
we
felt
sure
of
having
baffled
any
possible
pursuers
after
which
we
walked
on
quietly
and
crossing
one
of
the
long
bridges
over
the
river
found
ourselves
at
our
destination
a
room
had
been
taken
in
matsuné
name
and
some
of
the
bepowdered
and
berouged
girls
were
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
japanese
party
they
had
expected
to
meet
when
to
their
surprise
and
horror
three
europeans
were
ushered
into
their
midst
we
were
at
that
time
objects
of
more
alarm
than
interest
to
the
women
of
ozaka
the
fair
damsels
starting
up
with
a
scream
fairly
ran
away
and
no
assurances
from
our
friend
would
induce
them
to
return
the
keeper
of
the
house
besought
us
to
leave
as
a
crowd
might
collect
and
if
there
was
any
disturbance
he
would
get
into
trouble
and
so
we
had
to
submit
to
our
disappointment
but
even
the
slight
glimpse
we
had
of
the
native
beauties
seemed
to
compensate
for
the
risk
run
for
here
in
ozaka
no
foreigner
had
ever
been
admitted
to
the
quarter
on
another
occasion
when
we
were
accompanied
by
some
of
the
guard
we
had
better
success
and
enjoyed
the
society
of
some
for
several
hours
the
government
officials
having
given
their
consent
and
even
interfered
i
believe
on
our
behalf
matsuné
being
a
man
was
looked
on
with
much
suspicion
it
seemed
a
plucky
thing
on
his
part
to
spend
so
much
time
with
us
and
even
to
accompany
us
in
broad
daylight
to
the
opposite
to
where
the
mint
now
stands
everything
was
new
and
delightful
in
ozaka
politics
and
diplomacy
afforded
unceasing
interest
and
excitement
the
streets
shops
theatres
and
temples
were
full
of
life
and
character
of
a
kind
thoroughly
distinct
from
what
we
were
accustomed
to
in
yedo
and
yokohama
and
the
difference
of
dialect
and
costume
imparted
additional
piquancy
to
the
women
during
the
whole
five
weeks
we
spent
there
we
had
not
a
single
dull
day
there
was
always
something
to
do
in
the
intervals
of
our
official
work
visits
to
temples
and
theatres
according
to
the
elaborate
ceremonial
of
the
an
excursion
to
the
large
commercial
town
of
sakai
the
existence
of
which
in
such
close
proximity
to
ozaka
seems
hard
to
explain
near
our
residence
was
a
florist
establishment
famous
for
its
collection
of
orchids
which
in
japan
are
cultivated
more
for
their
foliage
than
for
their
flowers
this
taste
is
conditioned
by
the
fact
that
in
loochoo
china
and
japan
there
are
very
few
species
bearing
conspicuous
or
fine
blossoms
and
the
amateur
makes
the
best
of
what
is
procurable
more
attractive
to
the
european
was
the
exhibition
of
which
was
going
on
during
our
stay
these
flowers
are
now
fashionable
in
england
but
at
that
time
were
not
much
known
the
magnificent
pink
or
white
blossoms
of
various
shades
often
as
much
as
nine
inches
in
diameter
are
quite
unsurpassable
and
fully
justify
the
chinese
title
of
king
of
flowers
in
chinese
and
japanese
decorative
art
it
is
always
associated
with
the
lion
and
has
often
been
mistaken
for
the
rose
by
european
writers
shops
and
silk
stores
also
took
up
a
good
deal
of
our
time
but
the
fabrics
of
the
loom
had
not
then
attained
the
high
artistic
development
of
later
years
we
went
about
the
city
in
every
direction
and
though
frequently
encountering
men
of
the
class
never
met
with
any
instance
of
rudeness
while
the
common
people
were
uniformly
friendly
to
us
the
negotiations
between
the
foreign
representatives
and
the
delegates
of
the
japanese
government
proceeded
satisfactorily
though
somewhat
slowly
and
about
the
middle
of
may
had
reached
a
stage
at
which
it
was
felt
that
nothing
more
could
be
done
for
the
present
all
the
ministers
therefore
made
their
preparations
for
returning
to
yedo
before
leaving
that
part
of
the
country
sir
harry
made
a
trip
across
to
tsuruga
which
had
been
talked
of
as
a
possible
substitute
for
the
port
of
niigata
reported
to
be
practically
closed
to
commerce
for
one
half
of
the
year
by
the
combined
inconveniences
of
a
bar
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
on
which
it
stands
and
the
persistent
gales
that
raise
a
most
dangerous
sea
it
had
been
agreed
between
us
and
the
japanese
that
as
a
supplementary
refuge
for
ships
the
harbour
of
ebisuminato
in
the
island
of
sado
should
be
opened
if
necessary
but
only
as
an
anchorage
if
after
an
inspection
of
these
two
places
the
combined
arrangement
should
appear
unworkable
then
some
other
port
was
to
be
substituted
either
tsuruga
or
nanao
sir
harry
was
accompanied
by
lady
parkes
and
some
of
the
staff
he
proceeded
by
way
of
fushimi
along
the
western
side
of
the
biwa
lake
and
returning
by
the
eastern
shore
the
party
made
a
great
grievance
of
this
journey
and
fell
foul
of
the
government
for
having
permitted
the
barbarians
to
approach
so
near
to
the
sacred
capital
fushimi
being
practically
a
suburb
of
kiôto
and
the
satsuma
people
put
in
a
written
memorial
on
the
subject
more
to
annoy
the
tycoon
government
than
as
a
mark
of
real
hostility
to
us
of
course
we
did
not
know
of
this
until
long
after
i
obtained
leave
to
return
to
yedo
overland
and
wirgman
became
my
travelling
companion
a
proposal
was
made
to
sir
harry
by
the
tycoon
government
through
kawakatsu
omi
no
kami
to
procure
professors
for
english
for
a
large
public
school
to
be
established
in
yedo
on
the
basis
of
the
existing
kaiseijo
dr
temple
was
asked
by
her
majesty
government
to
furnish
a
sufficient
staff
at
salaries
which
we
in
the
legation
thought
quite
adequate
but
he
took
no
trouble
about
the
matter
and
we
thus
lost
the
opportunity
of
giving
an
english
turn
to
the
higher
class
education
of
the
country
chapter
xviii
overland
from
ozaka
to
yedo
for
centuries
the
interior
of
japan
had
been
closed
to
all
europeans
with
the
exception
of
the
head
of
the
dutch
trading
factory
at
nagasaki
who
used
to
travel
overland
to
yedo
at
fixed
intervals
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
shôgun
and
carry
valuable
presents
to
him
and
his
ministers
perhaps
the
best
account
of
these
tribute
bearing
missions
is
to
be
found
in
kaempfer
but
in
the
new
treaties
a
provision
had
been
inserted
giving
to
the
diplomatic
representatives
of
foreign
powers
the
right
of
travelling
throughout
the
country
and
sir
rutherford
alcock
had
availed
himself
of
this
privilege
a
few
years
earlier
as
he
has
recounted
in
his
court
and
capital
of
the
tycoon
as
a
guide
to
succeeding
travellers
it
can
not
be
said
that
his
description
of
the
journey
was
of
much
assistance
but
the
japanese
are
great
travellers
themselves
and
the
booksellers
shops
abound
in
printed
itineraries
which
furnish
the
minutest
possible
information
about
inns
roads
distances
ferries
temples
productions
and
other
particulars
which
the
tourist
requires
then
a
fairly
good
map
was
easily
procurable
not
drawn
to
scale
but
affording
every
geographical
detail
that
can
be
of
any
real
service
and
there
was
a
splendid
illustrated
guidebook
to
the
tôkaidô
containing
all
the
legendary
and
historical
lore
that
an
englishman
accustomed
to
his
murray
can
desire
there
are
two
great
roads
which
unite
the
eastern
and
western
capitals
namely
the
nakasendô
or
road
through
the
mountains
which
as
its
name
implies
traverses
the
central
provinces
and
the
tôkaidô
or
road
along
the
sea
to
the
east
which
follows
the
sea
shore
wherever
practicable
properly
speaking
this
is
not
the
original
name
of
the
road
but
rather
of
the
administrative
division
through
which
it
runs
but
practically
it
came
to
the
same
thing
it
was
the
latter
which
had
been
chosen
for
me
as
the
principal
highway
in
the
country
and
the
best
provided
with
inn
accommodation
ever
since
the
third
tokugawa
shôgun
established
the
rule
that
each
must
pass
a
portion
of
the
year
in
yedo
the
great
highroads
had
become
important
means
of
internal
communication
posting
stations
were
established
at
every
few
miles
for
the
supply
of
porters
and
baggage
ponies
and
at
each
of
these
were
erected
one
or
two
official
inns
called
for
the
use
of
and
high
functionaries
of
government
around
these
sprang
up
a
crowd
of
private
inns
and
houses
of
entertainment
where
the
retainers
and
travelling
merchants
used
to
put
up
the
tôkaidô
was
the
recognized
route
for
all
the
west
of
kiôto
and
of
course
for
those
whose
territories
lay
along
it
then
it
was
the
main
route
for
the
pilgrims
who
flocked
annually
to
the
sacred
shrines
in
isé
and
was
the
means
of
access
to
many
other
famous
temples
so
that
of
all
the
roads
in
japan
it
was
the
most
frequented
and
the
most
important
from
every
point
of
view
who
that
collects
japanese
colour
prints
is
unacquainted
with
the
numerous
delightful
series
of
views
devoted
to
its
illustration
which
present
such
vivid
pictures
of
japanese
life
one
of
the
most
famous
of
all
native
novels
is
occupied
with
the
adventures
of
a
couple
of
merry
dogs
on
their
way
from
yedo
up
to
kiôto
and
the
list
of
its
posting
towns
was
one
of
the
first
lessons
in
reading
and
writing
which
the
youth
of
japan
had
to
commit
to
memory
on
account
of
its
historical
and
legendary
associations
to
say
nothing
of
its
famous
scenery
it
occupied
something
of
the
same
place
in
the
imaginations
of
the
japanese
that
the
rhine
formerly
did
in
the
minds
of
english
tourists
before
the
loreley
rock
had
been
tunnelled
and
crowds
of
indifferent
travellers
were
hastily
whirled
in
a
few
hours
along
an
iron
track
on
either
side
of
the
great
stream
which
at
one
time
it
was
the
fashion
to
do
with
dignity
in
a
carriage
and
four
carefully
as
one
may
study
a
map
there
is
no
way
of
learning
geography
comparable
to
the
pedestrian
method
which
by
a
thousand
associations
of
pleasure
fatigue
and
weather
fixes
indelibly
the
minutest
topographical
facts
and
enables
the
student
of
history
to
understand
the
vicissitudes
of
warfare
japan
being
a
country
where
a
peculiar
political
system
had
taken
its
birth
from
centuries
of
civil
war
the
more
we
saw
of
its
interior
districts
the
more
likely
were
we
to
arrive
at
a
correct
understanding
of
the
problem
which
at
that
moment
was
being
attacked
by
the
rival
parties
i
do
not
pretend
that
any
considerations
such
as
these
determined
my
application
to
the
chief
for
permission
to
return
to
headquarters
by
land
insatiable
curiosity
as
to
everything
japanese
a
certain
love
of
adventure
and
dislike
of
life
on
board
of
a
were
the
real
motives
the
last
perhaps
as
strong
as
any
and
probably
many
persons
would
agree
with
me
in
preferring
to
spend
a
day
in
walking
from
calais
to
dover
if
it
were
practicable
to
taking
their
chance
of
rough
weather
in
a
steamer
even
though
it
might
not
last
for
more
than
an
hour
and
ten
minutes
wirgman
and
i
were
by
this
time
so
accustomed
to
living
on
japanese
food
that
we
resolved
not
to
burden
ourselves
with
stores
of
any
kind
knives
or
forks
finger
glasses
or
table
napkins
ponies
were
not
procurable
so
we
bought
a
couple
of
secondhand
palanquins
called
such
as
were
used
by
public
officials
and
had
them
repaired
they
cost
the
small
price
of
ichibus
each
or
not
the
pole
was
a
long
piece
of
deal
called
by
euphemism
paulownia
wood
a
cushion
of
silk
damask
thickly
stuffed
with
raw
cotton
was
spread
on
the
bottom
and
there
was
then
just
room
enough
to
sit
in
it
without
discomfort
in
front
was
a
small
shelf
above
the
window
and
underneath
a
small
flap
which
served
as
a
table
the
sliding
doors
also
had
windows
furnished
with
a
paper
slide
to
exclude
cold
and
another
covered
with
gauze
to
keep
out
the
dust
while
letting
in
the
air
if
it
rained
blinds
made
of
slender
strips
of
bamboo
were
let
down
over
the
windows
the
body
of
the
palanquin
could
also
be
enveloped
in
a
covering
of
black
oiled
paper
in
which
a
small
aperture
was
left
for
the
occupant
to
peep
out
of
a
blind
of
the
same
material
being
propped
up
outside
this
arrangement
was
however
only
resorted
to
on
days
of
persistent
rain
each
of
us
had
a
pair
of
oblong
baskets
to
hold
our
clothing
called
which
were
slung
at
opposite
ends
of
a
black
pole
and
carried
by
one
man
over
his
shoulder
my
bedding
which
consisted
of
a
couple
of
japanese
mattresses
covered
with
white
crape
and
edged
with
a
broad
border
of
common
brocade
known
as
and
one
of
the
huge
stuffed
bedgowns
called

of
figured

with
a
velvet
collar
with
a
couple
of
european
pillows
was
packed
in
a
wicker
box
of
the
kind
called
and
formed
a
burden
for
two
men
to
each
package
was
fastened
a
small
deal
board
on
which
my
name
and
titles
were
inscribed
with
indian
ink
in
large
chinese
characters
as
escort
we
had
ten
picked
men
belonging
to
the
native
legation
guard
and
a
couple
of
officials
belonging
to
the
japanese
foreign
department
were
attached
to
us
who
were
instructed
to
make
arrangements
for
our
accommodation
along
the
road
last
of
all
a
list
was
made
out
of
the
places
at
which
we
were
to
take
our
meals
and
sleep
at
night
the
journey
of
miles
from
fushimi
being
calculated
to
occupy
sixteen
days
on
the
may
having
exchanged
farewell
calls
with
the
commissioners
of
foreign
affairs
we
got
away
from
our
temple
lodging
at
nine
in
the
morning
willis
who
was
to
join
sir
harry
parkes
party
at
fushimi
accompanied
us
we
embarked
at
the
hachikenya
wharf
on
the
river
side
in
a
houseboat
the
escort
and
in
another
two
open
boats
following
with
the
luggage
of
the
whole
party
the
stream
was
very
strong
and
our
progress
was
correspondingly
slow
but
we
felt
that
we
were
travelling
in
a
dignified
manner
and
therefore
repressed
our
natural
impatience
where
the
stream
was
deep
enough
close
in
shore
the
boatmen
landed
and
towed
us
by
a
line
attached
to
the
top
of
a
mast
fixed
in
the
front
of
the
boat
while
the
steersman
remained
at
his
post
to
prevent
us
from
running
into
the
bank
when
the
towing
path
changed
to
the
opposite
side
the
boatmen
came
on
board
and
poled
across
to
resume
their
labour
as
before
the
river
which
winds
a
good
deal
is
enclosed
between
lofty
dykes
so
that
we
had
no
prospect
but
the
broad
surface
of
the
river
itself
and
the
tops
of
ranges
of
mountains
peering
over
the
bank
it
was
a
fine
day
and
we
were
full
of
eager
anticipations
about
the
novel
scenes
we
were
about
to
pass
through
every
inch
of
the
way
being
entirely
new
to
us
as
far
as
hakoné
and
for
myself
the
prospect
of
a
fortnight
holiday
was
especially
exhilarating
after
the
hard
work
of
the
past
five
weeks
by
one
we
reached
suido
mura
a
small
village
on
the
right
bank
about
five
miles
above
ozaka
and
landed
to
take
our
lunch
there
was
nothing
to
be
had
but
rice
and
which
did
not
constitute
a
very
palatable
meal
but
la
guerre
comme
à
la
we
passed
a
large
number
of
crowded
passenger
boats
descending
the
river
and
ten
barges
laden
with
bales
of
rice
at
six
we
stopped
at
hirakata
a
somewhat
more
important
place
than
suido
mura
here
we
landed
to
dine
off
soup
fish
and
rice
the
ordinary
constituents
of
a
traveller
meal
the
charge
for
our
three
selves
and
three
servants
was
less
than
an
and
a
second
was
given
as
or
noguchi
was
paymaster
and
gave
whatever
he
thought
right
under
this
heading
the
charge
seemed
extraordinarily
cheap
which
was
explained
by
a
regulation
binding
innkeepers
to
supply
persons
travelling
in
an
official
capacity
at
one
quarter
of
the
rates
charged
to
ordinary
people
we
started
again
by
moonlight
and
as
the
night
advanced
a
thin
mist
rose
and
covered
the
surface
of
the
broad
river
imparting
to
the
landscape
that
mysterious
sketchy
indistinctness
which
is
so
characteristic
of
japan
that
none
but
native
artists
whose
eyes
have
been
educated
to
it
from
their
childhood
have
ever
been
able
to
seize
and
represent
the
air
now
became
as
cold
as
it
had
been
hot
during
the
day
time
we
had
blankets
fetched
from
one
of
the
baggage
boats
and
lay
down
to
sleep
in
opposite
corners
of
the
boat
at
two
in
the
morning
i
woke
and
found
that
we
were
lying
off
the
guardhouse
on
the
right
bank
opposite
to
hashimoto
which
was
held
by
troops
of
matsudaira
hôki
no
kami
a
member
of
the
tycoon
council
the
other
bank
being
in
the
charge
of
tôdô
the
of
isé
we
had
been
as
far
as
yodo
where
they
turned
us
back
because
our
pass
had
not
been
viséd
here
and
we
did
not
reach
yodo
again
till
four
it
was
still
dark
the
moon
having
set
during
the
night
the
river
is
here
joined
by
the
kidzu
kawa
and
is
divided
into
several
channels
by
islands
lying
in
its
course
we
kept
along
the
right
bank
and
arrived
at
fushimi
about
six
where
we
found
sir
harry
on
the
point
of
starting
for
tsuruga
here
a
generous
member
of
his
party
gave
us
a
last
cigar
our
stock
had
been
completely
exhausted
during
the
long
stay
in
ozaka
and
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
we
had
to
content
ourselves
with
japanese
tobacco
smoked
in
tiny
whiffs
out
of
the
diminutive
native
pipes
all
inadequate
to
satisfy
a
craving
nourished
on
something
stronger
the
worst
of
the
japanese
pipe
with
its
metal
bowl
and
mouthpiece
united
by
a
hard
bamboo
stem
is
the
rapidity
with
which
it
gets
foul
necessitating
cleaning
at
least
once
a
day
with
a
slender
spill
twisted
out
of
tough
paper
willis
left
us
here
and
joined
the
chief
special
precautions
had
been
taken
by
the
government
to
prevent
sir
harry
turning
aside
to
kiôto
which
it
was
thought
his
adventurous
disposition
might
tempt
him
to
visit
after
breakfast
we
started
in
our
for
the
journey
overland
a
crowd
of
who
were
a
sort
of
municipal
officers
of
all
grades
dressed
in
their
sunday
best
escorted
us
out
of
the
town
our
road
lay
for
a
mile
or
so
between
the
banks
of
the
and
the
low
hills
masked
by
clumps
of
graceful
bamboo
and
then
leaving
the
tea
plantations
of
uji
to
the
right
we
journeyed
along
a
level
road
winding
through
the
hills
to
oiwaké
where
we
joined
the
tôkaidô
a
kind
of
stone
tramway
ran
from
kiôto
all
the
way
to
otsu
our
next
for
the
heavy
bullock
carts
of
which
we
passed
a
couple
of
score
laden
with
rice
for
the
use
of
the
garrison
at
the
capital
oiwaké
was
famous
for
pipes
counting
boards
and
a
species
of
comic
prints
called
and
lies
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
separating
the
province
of
yamashiro
from
the
beautiful
biwa
lake
by
the
roadside
we
had
an
opportunity
of
inspecting
some
establishments
on
a
small
scale
like
every
other
manufacturing
enterprise
in
those
days
the
fresh
tea
leaves
were
damped
then
spread
out
on
a
flat
table
heated
from
beneath
by
fuel
enclosed
in
a
plastered
chamber
and
twisted
by
hand
this
new
tea
forms
a
delicious
and
refreshing
drink
when
infused
after
the
japanese
method
for
the
finer
qualities
with
lukewarm
water
at
each
establishment
there
were
not
more
than
two
persons
at
work
at
one
we
got
to
otsu
and
after
lunch
went
to
a
monastery
called
to
enjoy
the
celebrated
prospect
of
the
lake
but
the
heat
had
covered
its
surface
with
a
dull
grey
haze
and
hid
it
entirely
from
view
we
found
everything
nicely
arranged
for
us
at
where
we
rested
for
the
meal
while
the
escort
and
foreign
office
men
in
our
train
vied
in
accommodating
themselves
to
our
wishes
from
otsu
a
level
road
skirted
the
lake
and
soon
after
passing
through
zézé
the
castle
town
of
honda
oki
no
kami
we
got
out
to
walk
in
crossing
the
great
double
bridge
of
séta
we
saw
a
couple
of
men
in
a
boat
spinning
for
carp
the
shallows
here
are
crowded
with
traps
irregular
shaped
enclosures
of
reeds
planted
in
the
mud
into
which
the
fish
enter
when
stormy
winds
agitate
the
surface
of
the
water
and
deprive
them
of
their
equanimity
but
before
reaching
kusatsu
where
we
were
to
put
up
for
the
night
we
retreated
into
our
kagos
in
order
not
to
be
overwhelmed
by
the
crowd
and
for
the
better
preservation
of
our
dignity
which
required
that
we
should
not
be
seen
on
foot
at
the
confines
of
the
town
we
were
met
by
a
deputation
of
the
municipal
officers
and
by
the
host
of
the
official
inn
who
escorted
us
in
with
great
pomp
keeping
back
the
inquisitive
multitude
our
bearers
quickened
their
pace
not
indeed
to
our
satisfaction
for
the
which
is
uncomfortable
at
all
times
becomes
almost
uninhabitable
when
the
men
get
out
of
a
walk
at
last
we
turned
round
a
corner
and
passing
through
a
black
gate
before
the
posts
of
which
were
two
neatly
heaps
of
sand
flanked
by
buckets
of
water
were
set
down
in
the
wide
porch
of
the
official
inn
it
was
one
of
the
most
beautifully
decorated
buildings
of
its
kind
that
i
have
ever
seen
that
implies
woodwork
of
the
finest
grain
plaster
of
the
least
obtrusive
shades
of
colour
sliding
doors
papered
with
an
artistic
pattern
touched
up
with
gold
leaf
and
framed
with
shining
black
lacquered
wood
and
hard
thick
mats
of
the
palest
straw
edged
with
stencilled
cotton
cloth
in
the
principal
room
only
twelve
feet
square
raised
six
inches
above
the
rest
of
the
house
lay
two
thick
mats
forming
a
sort
of
where
the
distinguished
traveller
was
expected
to
squat
without
moving
the
baggage
was
deposited
in
the
corridor
which
ran
round
two
sides
of
the
apartment
there
was
no
view
from
the
windows
which
looked
out
on
a
small
courtyard
enclosed
by
a
black
wooden
fence
etiquette
prescribed
that
a
great
man
should
neither
see
nor
be
seen
our
host
came
in
with
a
small
present
and
bowed
his
forehead
to
the
sill
after
a
few
minutes
he
returned
to
give
thanks
in
the
same
humble
manner
for
the
gift
of
two
which
he
had
received
as
we
went
in
turn
to
the
hot
bath
where
a
modest
not
to
say
prim
young
damsel
asked
whether
she
might
have
the
honour
of
washing
our
august
back
but
not
being
trained
from
our
youth
up
to
be
waited
on
by
lovely
females
during
our
ablutions
we
declined
her
assistance
at
dinner
time
we
ordered
a
dish
of
fish
and
a
bottle
of
which
had
to
be
several
times
replenished
before
the
artist
had
had
enough
the
people
of
the
inn
were
astonished
to
find
that
we
could
eat
rice
having
been
taught
to
believe
that
the
food
of
europeans
consisted
exclusively
of
beef
and
pork
when
we
went
to
bed
soft
silk
mattresses
in
plenty
were
spread
on
the
floor
and
the
chambermaid
placed
within
the
mosquito
net
a
with
a
bit
of
charcoal
neatly
embedded
in
white
ashes
for
a
last
smoke
and
a
pot
of
tea
yasumi
be
pleased
to
take
your
august
rest
was
the
end
of
the
first
day
in
japan
travellers
are
in
the
habit
of
making
an
early
start
a
native
usually
rises
before
day
makes
a
hasty
toilet
by
scrubbing
his
teeth
with
a
handful
of
salt
from
a
basket
hanging
over
the
kitchen
sink
washes
his
hands
and
face
without
soap
swallows
a
hasty
breakfast
and
is
on
the
road
as
soon
as
the
sun
is
up
or
even
earlier
his
principal
object
is
to
arrive
at
the
town
where
he
is
going
to
pass
the
night
at
as
early
an
hour
as
possible
in
order
to
secure
a
good
room
and
the
first
turn
at
the
hot
bath
there
being
only
one
tub
and
one
water
for
the
whole
of
the
guests
in
some
out
of
the
way
places
this
is
not
even
changed
every
day
and
i
remember
on
one
occasion
to
have
found
the
bath
absolutely
green
with
age
and
odorous
in
proportion
we
were
not
expected
to
do
as
the
vulgar
herd
and
did
not
get
away
much
before
seven
our
average
rate
of
going
was
about
three
miles
an
hour
and
the
day
journey
not
over
twenty
miles
but
there
were
so
many
interruptions
that
we
rarely
reached
our
evening
destination
before
six
first
and
foremost
there
was
the
meal
hiru
which
consumed
at
least
an
hour
and
then
our
exalted
rank
required
that
we
should
stop
to
rest
at
least
once
in
the
morning
and
once
again
in
the
afternoon
then
we
stopped
again
at
every
point
of
view
to
drink
tea
and
to
taste
every
dish
of
cakes
or
other
comestibles
of
which
centuries
of
wayfarers
had
been
in
the
habit
of
partaking
before
us
thus
on
the
third
day
we
stopped
at
to
take
tea
at
a
house
commanding
a
fine
view
of
the
legendary
mountain
mukadé
yama
centipede
mount
and
again
for
at
ishibé
where
a
big
board
was
stuck
up
outside
inscribed
with
the
little
of
the
interpreter
the
officer
of
england
we
lunched
sumptuously
at
minakuchi
on
fish
soup
and
rice
and
so
got
through
an
hour
and
a
quarter
at
ono
celebrated
for
pheasants
meat
preserved
in
paste
we
again
drank
tea
which
was
served
out
by
pretty
girls
who
made
a
great
pretence
of
bashfulness
wirgman
costume
consisting
of
wide
blue
cotton
trousers
a
loose
yellow
pongee
jacket
no
collar
and
a
conical
hat
of
grey
felt
gave
rise
to
a
grave
discussion
as
to
whether
he
was
really
an
european
or
only
a
chinaman
after
all
at
mayéno
a
centre
of
tea
production
we
stopped
for
another
to
taste
several
sorts
of
leaf
at
a
shop
this
was
a
great
act
of
condescension
on
the
part
of
such
distinguished
personages
but
we
made
up
for
this
derogation
from
our
dignity
by
having
our
purchases
paid
for
by
noguchi
the
real
japanese
swell
being
supposed
to
know
nothing
about
money
not
even
theoretically
the
dealer
declared
that
unless
the
leaf
is
picked
and
fired
by
virgins
it
will
not
be
drinkable
but
i
fear
he
was
humbugging
the
innocent
foreigner
many
of
the
houses
bore
a
inscribed
with
chinese
characters
meaning
economy
in
all
things
a
laconic
sentence
which
was
interpreted
to
signify
that
the
occupants
had
forsworn
social
entertainments
and
other
unnecessary
sources
of
expenditure
wirgman
made
himself
very
popular
by
the
sketches
he
threw
off
and
gave
away
to
the
innkeepers
sometimes
of
ourselves
as
we
appeared
on
the
road
or
of
a
bit
of
local
scenery
or
perhaps
a
pretty
girl
whose
bashful
pride
on
discovering
that
her
features
had
been
perpetuated
on
paper
was
a
pleasant
sight
to
contemplate
it
usually
took
some
time
before
the
waiting
maids
overcame
what
seemed
to
us
to
be
their
excessive
modesty
but
it
was
explained
to
us
that
women
were
not
usually
permitted
to
approach
the
as
noble
swells
had
their
own
to
attend
on
them
we
regretted
the
exigencies
of
our
lofty
position
and
pitied
the
who
have
always
to
be
correct
and
proper
in
public
another
consequence
of
our
supposed
high
rank
was
that
in
many
towns
the
people
knelt
down
by
the
side
of
the
street
as
we
passed
along
being
invited
to
assume
that
posture
by
the
municipal
officers
who
preceded
us
crying
out
down
down
this
honour
used
in
those
days
to
be
rendered
to
every
no
matter
whether
travelling
in
his
own
dominions
or
those
of
another
nobleman
and
also
to
the
high
officials
of
the
government
as
for
example
the
governor
of
kanagawa
to
the
great
indignation
of
the
european
residents
the
only
reported
instance
of
a
foreigner
ever
submitting
to
this
indignity
was
that
of
mr
eugene
van
reed
who
is
said
to
have
fallen
in
with
the
train
of
shimadzu
saburô
on
the
day
fatal
to
poor
richardson
and
to
have
then
and
there
conformed
to
the
native
custom
the
practice
had
its
origin
perhaps
in
the
necessity
of
protecting
the
nobles
from
sudden
attack
combined
with
the
rule
of
japanese
etiquette
which
considers
that
a
standing
posture
implies
disrespect
this
latter
fact
was
forcibly
impressed
on
me
at
fuchiû
where
i
went
to
visit
the
public
school
for
the
sons
of
having
taken
off
my
shoes
and
laid
my
hat
on
the
floor
at
the
entrance
i
was
escorted
into
a
room
where
about
thirty
youngsters
were
squatting
on
the
floor
with
chinese
books
before
them
which
they
were
learning
to
repeat
by
rote
from
the
mouths
of
older
and
more
advanced
pupils
under
the
superintendence
of
professors
i
bowed
and
remained
standing
but
to
my
surprise
no
one
acknowledged
my
salute
i
had
in
my
ignorance
of
propriety
assumed
what
to
the
japanese
appeared
an
attitude
of
disrespect
and
it
was
only
on
being
admonished
by
one
of
the
escort
that
i
discovered
my
error
which
being
at
once
repaired
the
professors
returned
my
bow
made
in
proper
form
with
head
to
the
ground
i
afterwards
found
it
necessary
to
adopt
japanese
manners
as
far
as
was
compatible
with
a
certain
that
forbade
my
sitting
on
my
heels
for
more
than
a
very
limited
period
but
could
never
resist
the
uneasy
feeling
that
while
i
was
pressing
my
forehead
on
the
mats
the
man
opposite
might
perhaps
be
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
inflict
a
slight
on
the
barbarian
by
sitting
bolt
upright
in
fact
japanese
themselves
were
not
exempt
from
a
similar
uncertainty
and
they
might
sometimes
be
detected
whilst
performing
the
obeisance
in
the
act
of
squinting
sideways
to
ascertain
whether
the
person
they
were
saluting
lowered
his
head
simultaneously
and
to
the
same
level
whenever
we
passed
through
a
town
of
any
importance
the
population
turned
out
eager
to
convert
the
occasion
into
a
holiday
at
kaméyama
for
instance
which
is
a
castle
town
the
streets
were
thronged
with
and
their
children
in
gala
dress
presenting
a
gay
appearance
some
of
the
young
girls
were
extremely
pretty
in
spite
of
the
quantity
of
white
powder
with
which
fashion
condemned
them
to
bedaub
their
faces
some
odd
methods
of
locomotion
were
practised
in
this
part
of
the
country
such
as
children
riding
in
nets
of
coarse
cord
suspended
from
opposite
ends
of
a
pole
carried
by
a
man
on
his
shoulder
women
riding
in
pairs
on
packhorses
and
in
the
flat
plain
between
séki
and
kuwana
in
small
open
omnibuses
not
unlike
the
costermonger
carts
in
which
fruit
is
hawked
about
the
streets
of
london
but
drawn
by
a
man
instead
of
a
donkey
perhaps
persons
in
one
of
these
small
vehicles
the
precursors
of
the
jinrikisha
which
came
into
vogue
in
wirgman
who
was
too
careless
of
his
dignity
for
he
was
travelling
not
as
an
artist
but
in
the
quality
of
a
or
government
official
insisted
in
getting
into
one
of
these
and
rode
all
the
way
from
tomida
to
kuwana
a
distance
of
at
least
five
miles
for
three
tempôes
say
at
a
at
komuki
we
were
presented
by
our
host
with
some
teapots
of
very
inferior
banko
ware
this
is
the
famous
unglazed
pottery
moulded
by
hand
and
showing
all
over
its
surface
both
inside
and
outside
the
marks
of
finger
tips
on
the
we
reached
kuwana
a
large
town
belonging
to
one
of
the
principal
hereditary
vassals
of
the
tokugawa
family
here
an
enormous
concourse
of
people
had
collected
to
see
us
make
our
entry
and
we
had
some
difficulty
in
making
our
way
through
the
crush
until
suddenly
the
procession
turned
aside
through
a
gateway
under
a
tower
and
traversed
the
outer
enceinte
of
the
castle
finally
arriving
at
the
official
inn
on
the
shore
of
the
bay
dealers
in
banko
ware
curious
stones
from
mino
and
fans
from
nagoya
came
flocking
in
and
the
evening
was
passed
in
bargaining
the
stage
from
kuwana
to
miya
is
by
sea
across
the
head
of
the
bay
of
owari
nowadays
people
perform
the
journey
by
steamer
but
in
we
had
to
content
ourselves
with
a
rather
dirty
boat
roofed
in
with
planks
we
left
at
seven
and
arrived
at
the
termination
of
our
voyage
a
little
after
eleven
but
as
the
distance
is
estimated
at
seven
ri
or
miles
we
were
precluded
from
going
further
that
day
i
proposed
therefore
to
devote
the
afternoon
to
visiting
nagoya
of
which
miya
is
little
more
than
a
suburb
it
boasts
a
castle
founded
by
nobunaga
towards
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
it
is
famous
throughout
japan
for
two
huge
golden
dolphins
which
surmount
the
donjon
tower
and
is
one
of
the
finest
extant
specimens
of
that
sort
of
architecture
but
the
foreign
department
officials
had
no
instructions
to
let
us
deviate
from
the
high
road
and
did
not
venture
to
take
on
themselves
the
responsibility
for
making
other
arrangements
they
promised
of
course
to
see
the
governor
of
the
town
and
ask
him
to
get
permission
which
they
represented
was
required
before
they
could
take
us
into
the
castle
town
of
a
great
noble
like
the
prince
of
owari
but
it
was
all
fudge
shopkeepers
flocked
in
laden
with
fans
metal
work
lacquered
porcelain
and
crape
with
which
we
occupied
the
interval
till
an
answer
should
be
received
from
the
authorities
at
nagoya
a
report
of
wirgman
skill
with
the
brush
having
spread
he
was
overwhelmed
with
quantities
of
chinese
paper
and
fans
which
our
host
said
had
been
brought
by
the
leading
inhabitants
who
desired
specimens
of
his
art
and
i
wrote
mottoes
to
his
productions
the
bottle
furnished
us
with
the
necessary
inspiration
but
we
found
out
at
last
that
the
fans
thus
decorated
were
being
sold
outside
at
an
a
piece
and
refused
to
be
imposed
on
any
further
in
the
evening
we
had
in
some
singing
and
dancing
girls
and
having
got
ourselves
up
in
native
costume
invited
the
two
foreign
office
clerks
and
some
of
our
escort
to
join
the
party
one
or
two
of
the
latter
became
so
merry
that
they
could
not
resist
a
temptation
to
perform
buffoon
dancing
and
sano
the
biggest
and
most
gave
imitations
of
famous
actors
we
did
not
get
rid
of
our
guests
until
nine
by
which
time
they
had
taken
a
good
quantity
of
on
board
in
passing
through
arimatsu
on
the
following
day
famous
for
cotton
dyed
in
the
same
way
as
the
indian
we
called
at
the
shop
where
the
heads
of
the
dutch
factory
at
nagasaki
had
been
in
the
habit
of
stopping
from
time
immemorial
on
the
occasion
of
their
annual
journeys
to
yedo
and
were
shown
a
ledger
containing
records
of
the
purchases
made
by
them
year
after
year
it
was
a
matter
of
obligation
to
follow
this
example
and
we
selected
some
pieces
of
the
stuff
which
oddly
enough
is
called
by
the
name
not
of
the
place
where
it
is
made
but
by
that
of
the
last
narumi
noguchi
and
the
two
foreign
department
officials
did
the
bargaining
while
wirgman
and
i
looked
on
and
smoked
in
dignified
silence
as
if
we
were
utterly
unconcerned
about
the
prices
the
owner
of
the
shop
was
a
distinguished
person
evidently
invested
with
a
municipal
function
in
consequence
of
which
he
was
allowed
to
have
a
few
stands
of
matchlocks
in
his
hall
many
of
the
houses
were
of
more
substantial
construction
than
usual
thus
testifying
to
the
prosperity
conferred
by
the
local
manufacture
at
chiriû
the
landlord
of
the
inn
where
we
lunched
came
privately
to
noguchi
and
asked
him
for
four
as
tea
money
on
the
ground
that
sir
alcock
had
given
that
sum
in
but
his
request
was
refused
and
he
was
forced
to
content
himself
with
what
we
had
paid
elsewhere
namely
half
an
i
always
left
such
questions
to
his
discretion
and
have
no
doubt
that
he
acted
rightly
in
the
afternoon
when
the
train
stopped
as
usual
to
give
the
palanquin
bearers
a
rest
the
people
of
the
or
presented
us
with
buckwheat
vermicelli
for
which
as
they
assured
us
the
place
was
reputed
famous
it
was
however
inferior
to
what
i
have
eaten
in
other
places
wirgman
fame
having
preceded
him
paper
brushes
and
ink
were
brought
and
he
executed
a
masterpiece
representing
us
eating
vermicelli
and
drinking
from
a
gourd
which
he
had
been
careful
to
get
replenished
at
miya
the
bridge
over
the
being
broken
down
we
crossed
the
river
in
a
ferry
boat
and
were
met
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
by
municipal
officers
and
constables
the
latter
being
furnished
by
the
local
whose
function
was
to
walk
at
the
head
of
the
procession
and
to
cry
down
down
down
went
the
whole
crowd
of
spectators
including
men
of
the
class
all
the
more
willingly
perhaps
because
that
was
the
only
way
they
had
of
bringing
their
eyes
to
a
level
with
the
windows
of
our
palanquins
for
etiquette
demanded
that
we
should
always
ride
in
entering
and
quitting
a
town
the
vulgar
practice
of
proceeding
on
foot
being
allowable
only
in
the
more
countryfied
portions
of
the
highroad
the
following
day
opened
with
what
promised
to
be
persistent
rain
and
we
had
to
be
fastened
up
in
our
palanquins
with
the
oiled
paper
covering
thrown
over
us
through
a
small
opening
we
could
just
manage
to
see
a
few
yards
to
right
and
left
all
day
long
we
ploughed
our
way
onwards
along
the
almost
level
road
which
in
places
was
flooded
nearly
six
inches
deep
at
arai
there
was
then
a
guardhouse
close
to
the
shore
of
the
hamana
bay
where
all
travellers
had
to
alight
from
their
palanquins
and
walk
through
taking
off
their
hats
and
shoes
in
order
to
show
respect
while
submitting
to
a
searching
examination
over
the
on
the
preceding
evening
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
chaff
about
our
being
obliged
to
subject
ourselves
to
this
rule
which
was
said
to
admit
of
no
exceptions
i
was
inwardly
resolved
not
to
submit
and
was
much
relieved
when
the
time
came
to
find
that
the
warden
was
satisfied
with
the
door
being
opened
about
as
we
were
carried
past
this
slight
concession
had
been
arranged
overnight
by
the
foreign
department
officers
in
order
that
the
letter
of
the
rule
enforcing
inspection
might
be
observed
and
we
were
quite
contented
as
the
door
was
opened
by
a
third
party
so
that
our
dignity
as
europeans
was
duly
saved
by
our
not
having
to
alight
some
years
ago
a
series
of
dykes
and
bridges
exceeding
a
mile
in
length
was
thrown
across
the
shallowest
part
of
the
bay
we
had
however
to
embark
in
boats
so
small
that
they
would
not
hold
more
than
a
single
the
spits
which
run
out
towards
each
other
at
the
mouth
gave
the
bay
the
appearance
of
a
landlocked
lake
until
we
got
across
and
the
breakers
became
visible
nevertheless
the
sea
at
the
point
where
we
crossed
was
as
smooth
as
a
mirror
two
miles
on
the
western
side
of
hamamatsu
we
were
met
by
some
retainers
of
inouyé
kawachi
no
kami
the
local
wearing
black
hats
as
flat
as
a
pancake
who
being
himself
a
member
of
the
tycoon
council
had
no
doubt
given
special
orders
regarding
our
reception
and
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
they
were
joined
by
more
the
procession
was
now
formed
in
the
following
order
two
in
green
mantles
with
one
in
brown
between
them
marched
a
long
way
ahead
to
clear
the
street
followed
by
a
couple
of
aldermen
in
single
file
on
each
side
of
the
road
and
a
couple
of
or
heralds
whose
fierce
demeanour
was
delightful
to
behold
who
roared
out
and
warned
some
young
who
displayed
a
disposition
to
approach
too
close
that
they
must
keep
at
a
respectful
distance
then
followed
our
with
one
of
the
native
escort
walking
on
each
side
then
a
constable
carrying
a
spear
and
behind
him
the
rest
of
the
escort
servants
and
baggage
on
arriving
at
the
inn
we
received
visits
from
the
head
merchants
and
were
told
that
we
were
to
be
specially
cared
for
by
orders
of
the
some
of
whose
retainers
kept
watch
and
ward
in
the
kitchen
throughout
the
night
this
being
very
spacious
and
situated
in
the
front
of
the
house
in
leaving
on
the
following
day
the
procession
was
arranged
in
the
same
way
and
as
we
passed
the
castle
gates
a
high
official
stationed
there
handed
his
card
to
one
of
the
to
present
to
me
at
the
end
of
the
town
the
escort
was
changed
and
we
were
placed
again
in
charge
of
the
four
who
did
not
leave
us
until
we
arrived
at
the
boundary
of
inouye
the
territory
after
the
rain
of
the
day
before
yesterday
the
country
looked
especially
beautiful
ripe
fields
of
barley
behind
the
rows
of
tall
pine
trees
that
lined
the
road
stretched
right
away
to
the
foot
of
the
nearer
hills
behind
which
rose
range
after
range
in
the
blue
distance
we
met
yesterday
and
soldiers
of
the
regiment
of
the
drilled
troops
marching
to
kiôto
to
support
the
new
policy
of
the
head
of
the
government
and
perhaps
to
defend
him
against
an
armed
confederation
of
the
leading
of
the
west
as
soon
as
the
local
escort
had
turned
back
we
descended
from
our
palanquins
to
pursue
our
way
on
foot
to
the
which
we
crossed
by
means
of
ferry
boats
the
river
here
is
very
wide
and
the
current
swift
and
except
during
freshets
is
divided
into
two
branches
by
a
sandbank
which
occupies
the
middle
of
the
stream
wirgman
had
stopped
behind
to
sketch
and
i
waited
with
one
of
the
foreign
office
officials
who
confided
to
me
that
we
should
probably
meet
a
barbáre
on
the
road
by
this
i
understood
the
a
high
official
of
the
mikado
court
who
was
returning
from
a
mission
to
the
tomb
of
iyéyasu
at
nikkô
he
was
of
higher
rank
than
any
japanese
and
everyone
on
meeting
him
had
to
get
out
of
his
palanquin
and
go
down
on
his
knees
my
informant
hoped
we
should
manage
to
avoid
him
and
i
hoped
so
too
the
rest
of
the
party
having
at
last
come
up
we
proceeded
by
a
short
cut
through
the
fields
which
saved
us
a
couple
of
miles
walking
we
got
to
mitsuké
where
we
were
to
lunch
some
time
before
noon
the
streets
were
crowded
with
pretty
girls
who
had
turned
out
to
see
the
foreigners
our
host
who
had
put
on
his
robes
of
ceremony
made
his
appearance
bowing
low
and
bearing
a
gift
of
dried
fry
which
when
toasted
and
dipped
in
soy
is
very
palatable
handsome
turkish
carpets
had
been
spread
in
the
bedroom
two
charming
little
boys
about
ten
years
of
age
with
perfect
manners
were
told
off
to
wait
on
us
the
was
of
course
the
principal
topic
of
discussion
he
had
not
yet
passed
and
our
followers
were
full
of
anxiety
noguchi
said
that
all
japanese
of
rank
down
to
the
lowest
man
got
out
of
his
way
because
his
followers
were
in
the
habit
of
extorting
money
on
the
pretext
that
the
proper
amount
of
respect
had
not
been
paid
to
the
great
man
i
was
quite
ready
to
follow
the
example
of
the
japanese
in
avoiding
if
possible
the
chance
of
an
encounter
we
were
told
that
the
whose
rank
by
this
time
had
been
much
diminished
in
the
mouths
of
our
informants
was
to
stop
the
night
at
fukuroi
the
very
next
town
only
four
miles
further
so
we
hurried
away
hoping
to
get
to
our
own
destination
early
in
the
afternoon
two
miles
over
the
tableland
then
down
a
beautiful
hill
covered
with
pine
trees
then
two
more
over
the
rice
field
flat
to
fukuroi
where
we
changed
the
palanquin
and
baggage
porters
and
hastened
on
without
stopping
the
of
may
the
peasants
were
cutting
barley
and
planting
out
the
young
rice
i
did
the
six
miles
more
to
kakégawa
in
two
hours
including
the
last
stoppage
which
was
considered
very
quick
going
a
young
satsuma
man
who
was
on
his
way
to
nagasaki
called
at
our
inn
and
gave
me
an
account
of
the
and
the
doings
of
his
retainers
for
whom
he
professed
the
greatest
contempt
he
said
they
were
wretched
citizens
of
kiôto
hired
for
the
occasion
and
dressed
in
a
little
brief
authority
at
shinagawa
the
last
suburb
of
yedo
they
had
seized
eighteen
people
and
fined
them
for
exhibiting
a
want
of
respect
towards
the
mikado
messenger
it
was
rumoured
that
he
would
pass
through
about
six
and
spend
the
night
at
fukuroi
six
came
but
no
we
passed
the
evening
in
expectation
and
went
to
bed
still
no
wirgman
and
i
slept
in
separate
rooms
noguchi
in
a
third
and
all
the
escort
but
one
were
quartered
at
another
house
a
little
way
off
at
a
quarter
past
one
i
was
roused
from
sleep
by
a
japanese
saying
to
me
satow
satow
get
your
sword
they
come
my
sword
was
an
old
cavalry
sabre
not
good
for
much
but
to
make
a
show
i
got
up
and
groped
my
way
through
the
black
darkness
to
the
in
the
alcove
and
got
the
weapon
the
japanese
led
me
by
the
hand
and
we
stood
together
in
a
corner
of
the
next
room
wondering
what
was
going
to
happen
he
said
i
wish
the
escort
would
come
meanwhile
violent
noises
were
heard
as
if
of
people
breaking
in
bewildered
by
the
darkness
i
imagined
them
to
be
coming
from
the
little
garden
at
the
back
on
to
which
my
bedroom
looked
we
remained
still
and
breathless
in
three
minutes
all
was
silent
again
and
i
heard
a
voice
cry
mr
satow
it
was
noguchi
who
appeared
with
a
light
and
reported
that
the
enemy
had
fled
wirgman
and
my
chancery
servant
yokichi
were
nowhere
to
be
found
the
japanese
who
had
woke
me
proved
to
be
matsushita
the
youngest
of
the
escort
we
proceeded
then
towards
noguchi
room
the
wooden
door
opposite
was
lying
on
the
floor
where
the
assailants
had
broken
in
as
we
stood
in
the
passage
others
of
the
escort
came
in
all
dressed
in
fighting
mantles
with
drawn
swords
in
their
hands
and
wearing
iron
forehead
pieces
seeing
my
scarlet
sleeping
trousers
they
begged
me
either
to
hide
myself
or
take
them
off
but
the
danger
being
past
i
only
laughed
at
them
two
of
them
went
in
search
of
wirgman
and
found
him
in
an
alley
leading
to
the
back
of
the
house
they
narrowly
escaped
being
shot
we
began
to
feel
cooler
and
noguchi
narrated
what
had
happened
he
heard
the
noise
of
the
front
door
being
broken
down
jumped
up
tied
his
girdle
and
stood
in
the
doorway
of
his
room
a
sword
in
the
right
hand
a
revolver
in
the
left
some
men
approached
and
asked
for
the
barbarians
to
which
he
replied
that
if
they
would
only
come
in
he
would
give
the
barbarians
to
them
they
took
fright
at
his
attitude
and
determined
tone
and
fled
altogether
there
were
he
thought
about
a
dozen
two
armed
with
long
swords
the
rest
with
short
ones
on
looking
about
we
discovered
that
the
mosquito
nets
in
the
room
diagonal
to
wirgman
had
been
cut
to
pieces
the
occupants
having
escaped
it
was
lucky
for
us
that
we
had
put
out
the
lamps
before
going
to
bed
so
that
the
assailants
could
not
find
their
way
wirgman
explained
that
on
being
awakened
by
the
noise
of
people
breaking
down
the
doors
and
shouting
for
the
barbarians
he
followed
the
people
of
the
house
who
took
to
their
heels
a
lantern
that
had
been
dropped
by
one
of
the
ruffians
led
to
the
conclusion
that
they
belonged
to
the
suite
no
one
was
hurt
except
one
of
the
assailants
who
in
the
of
running
away
was
accidentally
wounded
by
a
companion
after
everyone
had
related
his
own
experiences
i
retired
to
bed
while
wirgman
called
for
and
sliced
raw
fish
with
which
he
and
the
escort
regaled
themselves
until
daylight
on
getting
up
in
the
morning
my
first
step
was
to
send
for
the
two
foreign
office
officials
and
endeavour
to
obtain
redress
through
them
the
escort
who
had
not
appeared
on
the
scene
till
the
danger
was
past
were
now
very
anxious
to
distinguish
themselves
by
some
act
of
valour
i
told
the
officials
with
the
full
support
of
the
escort
that
they
should
either
get
the
guilty
men
delivered
up
to
me
or
that
i
would
go
with
my
escort
and
take
them
by
force
this
was
the
attitude
maintained
until
i
verily
believe
that
if
i
had
given
the
signal
the
escort
would
have
attacked
the
lodgings
at
last
the
official
came
back
and
said
that
the
people
refused
to
give
the
men
up
to
me
as
an
alternative
they
proposed
to
obtain
a
written
apology
coupled
with
a
promise
to
punish
the
assailants
on
their
reaching
kiôto
to
this
i
expressed
my
willingness
to
assent
in
the
hope
that
we
should
be
able
to
pursue
our
journey
before
night
set
in
but
the
negotiations
lingered
and
this
was
not
to
be
so
we
sent
for
some
musicians
and
invited
the
two
officials
and
the
escort
to
a
banquet
wirgman
and
one
of
the
escort
entertained
the
company
with
dancing
another
of
the
escort
got
very
drunk
and
begged
me
to
take
him
into
my
personal
service
on
the
same
terms
as
noguchi
we
heard
that
the
townspeople
were
delighted
at
the
and
his
blackguards
being
so
bothered
by
a
couple
of
foreigners
no
mikado
messenger
was
ever
before
stopped
on
his
road
and
talked
to
in
our
imperious
manner
four
or
five
of
the
escort
when
full
of
started
up
the
street
in
their
fighting
mantles
and
created
great
alarm
in
the
minds
of
the
retainers
who
thinking
they
were
to
be
attacked
in
earnest
begged
for
a
guard
from
the
of
the
town
the
captain
of
the
escort
and
two
others
in
particular
behaved
in
a
delightfully
swaggering
manner
but
in
spite
of
all
this
nothing
was
settled
and
we
had
to
stop
a
second
night
on
the
following
morning
on
getting
up
i
was
told
that
matters
were
nearly
arranged
that
the
men
who
had
attacked
our
lodgings
were
to
be
left
behind
in
the
custody
of
the
the
people
at
the
castle
giving
a
receipt
on
his
behalf
the
morning
wore
on
without
the
desired
document
making
its
appearance
and
i
feared
they
would
slip
through
my
fingers
altogether
i
got
tired
of
waiting
and
went
to
sleep
from
which
i
was
awakened
by
one
of
the
foreign
office
officials
who
had
been
acting
as
bringing
me
a
certified
copy
signed
by
the
governor
of
the
town
of
a
written
undertaking
given
by
a
leading
retainer
of
the
to
remain
there
with
three
of
the
assailants
another
copy
was
given
to
him
and
he
started
at
once
for
ozaka
with
it
accompanied
by
one
of
the
escort
i
was
now
asked
whether
i
would
permit
the
to
depart
to
which
i
gave
my
assent
we
saw
him
and
his
retinue
pass
the
inn
there
were
two
large
palanquins
smaller
ones
and
about
fifty
fellows
in
green
coats
we
had
thus
remained
on
the
field
of
victory
as
soon
as
the
was
clear
of
the
place
we
started
in
the
opposite
direction
about
three
in
the
afternoon
the
people
offered
to
give
us
a
body
of
men
to
escort
us
out
of
the
town
but
i
replied
that
my
escort
was
sufficient
to
ensure
our
safety
a
guard
of
honour
was
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
inn
as
we
left
and
eight
policemen
accompanied
us
to
the
exit
of
the
town
ultimately
some
months
later
these
men
and
three
others
implicated
in
the
affair
were
brought
to
yedo
and
put
on
their
trial
two
were
condemned
to
death
and
four
more
to
transportation
to
an
island
sir
harry
wanted
me
to
be
present
at
the
execution
of
these
two
men
but
i
persuaded
him
to
send
some
one
else
instead
to
look
on
at
the
execution
of
men
who
have
tried
to
take
one
life
would
have
borne
an
appearance
of
revengefulness
which
one
would
not
have
liked
but
i
think
that
under
the
circumstances
of
those
times
the
punishment
was
rightly
inflicted
our
next
stage
was
to
nissaka
a
pretty
little
town
lying
in
a
basin
of
hills
beyond
rose
a
steep
ascent
which
we
climbed
not
without
fatigue
to
find
ourselves
on
the
top
of
a
tableland
running
away
to
the
sea
on
our
right
while
on
the
left
hills
rose
ever
higher
and
higher
above
the
road
being
cultivated
up
to
their
summits
in
tiny
level
plots
cut
out
of
their
sides
at
the
highest
point
of
the
road
we
rested
at
a
where
a
kind
of
soft
rice
cake
bedaubed
with
a
substance
resembling
extract
of
malt
was
served
to
us
by
a
diminutive
girl
though
fifteen
years
of
age
and
consequently
nearly
full
grown
she
did
not
measure
four
feet
in
height
on
the
further
side
of
the
tableland
lay
kanaya
the
next
and
beyond
that
the
which
had
to
be
crossed
before
we
could
gain
our
stopping
place
for
the
night
a
hundred
naked
porters
hurried
forward
to
carry
our
palanquins
and
baggage
to
the
other
bank
for
ourselves
there
were
a
sort
of
square
stretcher
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
twelve
men
for
greater
safety
who
made
a
point
of
plunging
into
the
deepest
part
of
the
torrent
to
give
us
a
greater
idea
of
the
difficulties
they
had
to
contend
with
for
the
idea
then
entertained
by
every
japanese
was
that
the
force
of
the
stream
was
too
great
for
a
boat
to
live
in
it
and
that
a
bridge
was
impossible
as
it
has
since
been
successfully
bridged
the
probability
is
that
this
belief
was
purposely
inculcated
on
the
people
on
the
principle
of
et
and
what
more
effectual
means
of
division
could
be
found
than
a
river
which
was
not
to
be
passed
but
by
taking
off
your
clothes
and
running
the
risk
of
drowning
in
it
while
effecting
the
passage
to
say
nothing
of
the
inconvenience
of
emerging
on
the
other
side
that
is
to
say
unless
you
could
pay
to
be
carried
following
the
economical
practice
we
had
observed
all
along
of
limiting
our
tips
to
the
smallest
respectable
sum
we
threw
a
to
the
men
who
clamoured
loudly
for
its
division
the
share
of
each
being
somewhat
over
of
a
penny
we
did
not
get
to
the
inn
till
eight
our
host
was
particularly
polite
and
thanked
us
profoundly
for
doing
him
the
honour
of
stopping
at
his
humble
abode
we
were
still
under
the
influence
of
the
excitement
produced
by
our
recent
adventures
so
and
fish
were
ordered
in
and
the
liveliest
of
the
escort
were
bidden
to
the
feast
some
one
distinguished
himself
by
adding
a
new
verse
to
the
popular
ballad
then
in
vogue
expressive
of
our
contempt
for
the
coated
retainers
of
the
which
was
sung
over
and
over
again
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
lute
played
by
an
exceedingly
ugly
red
faced
damsel
who
waited
on
us
the
next
day
brought
us
to
the
large
town
of
fuchiû
formerly
the
residence
of
iyéyasu
after
his
retirement
from
the
active
government
of
the
state
early
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
since
shidzuoka
it
is
an
important
centre
of
the
tea
and
paper
trades
and
at
the
time
we
passed
through
was
the
seat
of
one
of
the
principal
universities
of
japan
but
greatly
fallen
from
its
ancient
grandeur
on
our
way
we
had
to
taste
various
local
delicacies
among
which
was
a
horribly
tenacious
kind
of
gruel
resembling
in
appearance
made
from
the
powdered
root
of
the
dioscorea
japonica
a
species
of
wild
potato
we
found
the
streets
so
full
of
spectators
that
it
became
necessary
to
get
into
our
palanquins
to
avoid
the
crush
of
curious
sightseers
the
town
is
also
noted
for
a
variety
of
articles
of
cabinet
work
and
lacquered
ware
of
the
ordinary
sort
and
the
room
next
to
our
apartment
had
been
converted
into
a
kind
of
bazaar
in
expectation
of
our
arrival
the
articles
were
of
the
class
common
enough
at
yokohama
and
not
much
cheaper
in
fact
the
prices
were
such
as
befitted
the
supposed
exalted
rank
of
the
travellers
in
those
days
in
japan
it
was
a
well
observed
doctrine
that
noblesse
oblige
in
the
matter
of
payments
next
morning
when
we
rose
at
six
we
got
a
beautiful
view
of
fuji
the
peerless
one
springing
from
the
ground
as
it
seemed
almost
behind
the
inn
and
lifting
its
beautiful
head
into
the
pale
blue
sky
above
horizontal
wreaths
and
stretches
of
cloud
after
breakfast
we
paid
a
visit
to
the
university
where
we
found
about
thirty
youngsters
seated
on
the
floor
in
one
room
with
copies
of
some
chinese
classic
before
them
learning
to
read
by
rote
from
the
mouths
of
older
and
more
advanced
pupils
this
instruction
was
given
for
about
two
hours
each
morning
and
six
times
a
month
explanations
of
the
text
were
imparted
by
professors
the
headmaster
who
was
from
the
confucian
college
at
yedo
used
to
be
changed
annually
and
this
with
the
addition
of
learning
to
write
with
a
brush
constituted
the
education
of
a
young
japanese
in
the
olden
time
the
system
was
one
that
cultivated
the
memory
but
failed
altogether
to
appeal
to
the
reasoning
faculties
of
course
all
this
has
long
ago
disappeared
and
it
is
possible
that
this
system
of
instruction
is
as
obsolete
in
japan
as
the
dodo
the
great
mountain
having
at
last
appeared
on
our
horizon
we
were
to
have
its
company
for
nearly
every
step
of
the
rest
of
the
journey
near
ejiri
we
caught
a
delicious
view
of
the
summit
appearing
over
the
lower
mountains
on
the
left
hand
at
one
we
reached
okitsu
where
we
were
to
lunch
the
inn
stood
close
to
the
sea
shore
and
possessed
an
upper
room
commanding
a
magnificent
view
in
favour
of
which
we
abandoned
the
dignified
glories
of
the
or
dais
on
the
left
the
blue
promontory
of
idzu
stretched
away
far
into
the
ocean
until
it
became
almost
invisible
in
the
haze
on
the
right
hand
the
low
hills
of
terminating
in
a
low
spit
of
sand
covered
with
irregular
growth
of
pine
trees
the
famous
miyo
no
matsubara
of
the
japanese
poets
from
the
back
window
we
had
a
glimpse
of
the
snowy
peak
of
fuji
peeping
over
the
tops
of
the
intervening
hills
and
by
craning
our
necks
out
sideways
the
head
of
the
futagoyama
near
hakoné
on
leaving
this
spot
which
we
did
with
reluctance
we
followed
the
base
of
the
cliffs
for
two
or
three
miles
along
the
shore
when
suddenly
we
turned
a
corner
and
fuji
came
full
in
view
in
front
the
base
of
the
great
mountain
was
hidden
by
the
low
range
which
runs
down
into
the
sea
near
kambara
and
a
white
cloud
encircled
its
middle
wirgman
sat
down
to
make
a
sketch
from
which
he
painted
a
picture
which
is
still
in
my
possession
next
we
reached
kurazawa
famous
for
and
a
big
whorl
with
a
curious
spiral
operculum
of
course
we
rested
here
awhile
to
eat
of
the
local
dish
washed
down
with
repeated
cups
of
in
which
the
guard
joined
us
since
the
affair
of
kakégawa
we
had
become
great
friends
as
men
usually
do
who
have
shared
the
same
perils
the
road
followed
the
here
to
kambara
and
would
be
one
of
the
most
picturesque
in
japan
but
for
the
dirty
uninteresting
fishing
villages
which
line
nearly
the
whole
of
its
length
next
morning
we
were
astir
early
and
crossing
the
low
intervening
hills
reached
the
banks
of
the
fuji
kawa
at
eight
extensive
preparations
had
been
made
at
the
official
hotel
for
our
reception
mats
laid
down
to
the
entrance
and
red
blankets
spread
on
the
floor
of
the
dais
at
the
urgent
entreaty
of
the
innkeeper
we
turned
in
for
a
few
minutes
and
discovered
that
wirgman
was
an
ancient
acquaintance
of
our
host
having
seen
him
when
he
travelled
overland
from
nagasaki
to
yedo
in
in
the
suite
of
sir
rutherford
alcock
we
were
shown
into
the
best
room
with
much
ceremony
and
when
we
had
taken
our
seats
on
the
floor
boxes
were
brought
in
full
of
chestnut
meal
cakes
the
speciality
of
the
village
with
a
bit
of
pickled
radish
on
the
top
other
famous
things
sold
here
are
ink
stones
bits
of
crystal
with
green
streaks
in
them
supposed
by
the
common
people
to
be
grass
also
agates
we
crossed
in
a
boat
the
narrow
turbulent
fuji
kawa
running
between
wide
beds
of
shingle
nowadays
you
cross
in
the
train
we
then
had
a
view
of
fuji
almost
rising
out
of
the
sea
and
drawing
its
skirts
up
gradually
behind
it
curious
but
not
so
beautiful
as
when
it
is
partly
concealed
by
lesser
summits
which
afford
a
standard
of
comparison
it
looks
in
fact
more
like
an
exaggerated
molehill
than
anything
else
we
met
on
the
road
two
little
boys
of
twelve
and
fourteen
years
of
age
who
having
begged
their
way
as
pilgrims
all
the
way
from
yedo
to
the
sacred
temples
of
isé
and
of
kompira
in
sanuki
were
now
on
their
way
home
carrying
slung
across
their
backs
huge
packages
of
temple
charms
done
up
in
oiled
paper
the
road
was
terribly
sandy
and
hot
and
passing
for
the
most
part
between
the
bamboo
fences
of
cottagers
gardens
was
the
reverse
of
picturesque
we
had
intended
to
sleep
at
hakoné
but
owing
to
delays
for
sketching
to
say
nothing
of
a
huge
feast
of
broiled
eels
and
at
kashiwabara
did
not
manage
to
get
beyond
mishima
at
the
western
foot
of
the
hills
next
morning
we
started
at
six
to
ascend
the
pass
which
climbs
the
range
of
mountains
by
an
excellent
road
paved
with
huge
stones
after
the
manner
of
the
via
appia
where
it
leaves
rome
at
the
forum
and
lined
with
huge
pine
trees
and
cryptomerias
at
a
tiny
hamlet
more
than
halfway
up
some
hunters
came
to
present
us
with
eggs
according
to
immemorial
custom
three
hours
brought
us
to
hakoné
the
little
mountain
village
standing
on
the
southern
border
of
the
lake
surrounded
by
steep
grassy
hills
the
warmth
of
the
day
tempted
me
to
take
a
bath
in
the
lake
which
at
first
was
strenuously
opposed
by
the
foreign
official
with
us
it
appeared
that
no
boats
were
allowed
on
the
lake
nor
was
any
one
permitted
to
swim
in
it
lest
he
should
take
the
opportunity
of
swimming
round
at
the
back
of
the
barrier
gate
and
so
avoid
the
necessity
of
showing
his
passport
with
considerable
trouble
i
persuaded
the
objector
to
withdraw
his
opposition
by
representing
that
my
natatory
powers
were
altogether
insufficient
for
the
purpose
after
a
couple
of
hours
spent
in
this
charming
spot
which
nowadays
has
become
a
fashionable
summer
retreat
of
foreigners
residing
at
yokohama
we
resumed
our
journey
down
the
eastern
side
of
the
pass
already
described
in
a
previous
chapter
and
got
to
our
inn
at
odawara
by
five
little
dreaming
of
what
lay
before
me
a
letter
from
sir
harry
parkes
was
at
once
delivered
to
me
urging
me
to
hasten
my
return
as
there
were
important
negotiations
on
foot
on
conferring
with
the
leader
of
the
escort
i
learnt
that
by
starting
at
once
and
travelling
through
the
night
i
might
get
to
yedo
next
morning
eight
porters
in
relays
of
four
would
be
able
to
carry
the
palanquin
at
the
rate
of
about
four
miles
an
hour
so
the
men
were
ordered
without
delay
the
japanese
on
these
occasions
to
save
themselves
from
being
too
severely
shaken
wind
a
broad
piece
of
cotton
cloth
tightly
round
the
waist
and
tie
another
piece
round
the
temples
a
third
is
suspended
from
the
ceiling
of
the
palanquin
to
which
the
traveller
clings
with
might
and
main
i
had
to
adopt
this
arrangement
and
in
addition
stuffed
my
palanquin
full
of
bedding
and
pillows
noguchi
and
two
of
the
escort
accompanied
me
to
negotiate
the
changes
of
coolies
at
the
various
posting
stations
on
the
way
and
by
seven
we
were
in
motion
the
porters
maintained
a
constant
crying
in
order
to
keep
step
with
each
other
and
render
the
swinging
of
the
palanquin
less
unendurable
to
sleep
was
impossible
as
this
noise
continued
all
night
when
the
day
broke
we
had
done
miles
which
was
slower
than
i
had
expected
so
we
urged
on
the
fresh
men
we
got
here
and
accomplished
the
remaining
miles
by
ten
from
sitting
so
many
hours
i
was
almost
unable
to
stand
upright
when
i
got
to
the
legation
and
the
vexatious
part
of
it
all
was
that
the
important
conference
which
i
had
hurried
to
be
present
at
turned
out
to
be
a
mere
complimentary
visit
of
a
crowd
of
officials
for
whom
anyone
could
easily
have
interpreted
chapter
xix
social
intercourse
with
japanese
officials
visit
to
niigata
sado
gold
mines
and
nanao
our
relations
with
government
officials
suddenly
from
this
time
onward
assumed
a
character
of
cordiality
which
formerly
would
have
been
thought
impossible
this
was
of
course
in
consequence
of
very
explicit
instructions
given
by
the
tycoon
to
his
ministers
to
cultivate
the
friendship
of
the
foreign
missions
and
especially
of
the
british
legation
in
order
doubtless
to
counteract
the
intimate
intercourse
which
was
known
to
be
carried
on
between
ourselves
and
the
retainers
of
satsuma
and
chôshiû
each
of
the
commissioners
for
foreign
affairs
in
turn
invited
me
to
dine
with
him
in
japanese
fashion
and
as
i
was
extremely
ignorant
of
japanese
etiquette
noguchi
used
to
accompany
me
on
these
occasions
to
be
my
tutor
an
exchange
of
presents
was
always
an
important
part
of
the
entertainment
and
this
was
a
very
troublesome
business
on
account
of
the
difficulty
of
buying
anything
at
the
foreign
stores
in
yokohama
that
was
worth
giving
away
as
a
specimen
of
english
productions
most
of
these
officials
lived
in
a
very
modest
way
the
rooms
in
which
they
gave
their
entertainments
were
usually
upstairs
perhaps
not
more
than
twelve
feet
by
fifteen
but
as
there
was
no
furniture
there
was
plenty
of
space
on
arriving
at
the
house
we
were
shown
up
a
very
narrow
staircase
and
through
an
equally
narrow
door
down
we
plumped
on
our
knees
immediately
and
bowed
our
heads
to
the
mats
to
the
host
who
did
the
same
then
ensued
a
contest
of
politeness
our
entertainer
trying
to
get
us
nearer
to
the
top
of
the
room
and
we
protesting
that
we
were
very
comfortable
where
we
were
of
course
it
ended
in
my
being
put
down
in
front
of
the
recess
which
is
the
seat
of
honour
while
noguchi
remained
where
he
was
just
inside
the
door
usually
i
was
then
allowed
to
cross
my
legs
in
tailor
fashion
owing
to
my
joints
not
having
yet
acquired
the
lissomness
of
the
japanese
then
noguchi
with
great
solemnity
unwrapping
the
present
would
slide
across
the
floor
and
deposit
it
between
the
host
and
myself
in
japan
you
do
use
brown
paper
for
parcels
but
every
household
possesses
a
set
of
cloths
of
different
sizes
silk
or
crape
for
the
smaller
of
cotton
dyed
green
for
the
larger
which
fulfil
the
same
purpose
as
paper
then
i
pushed
the
present
gently
towards
my
entertainer
saying
this
is
really
a
very
shabby
article
but
as
it
is
a
production
of
my
contemptible
country
i
to
which
he
would
reply
really
i
am
quite
overpowered
what
a
magnificent
article
i
am
really
ashamed
to
deprive
you
of
it
and
then
all
women
folk
the
servants
and
the
children
who
were
peeping
in
at
the
door
or
round
the
corner
of
the
balcony
which
ran
along
the
front
of
the
room
would
crane
out
their
necks
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
precious
rarity
from
the
far
west
then
the
other
guests
three
or
four
in
number
would
begin
to
arrive
if
they
were
strangers
the
following
dialogue
would
take
place
each
person
putting
his
hands
together
on
the
mat
in
front
would
bend
over
and
almost
touching
them
with
his
forehead
say
i
have
the
honour
to
present
myself
to
you
for
the
first
time
my
name
is
i
hope
to
enjoy
your
friendship
in
perpetuity
to
which
either
may
add
that
he
has
often
heard
of
the
great
fame
of
the
other
and
longed
for
an
opportunity
of
meeting
him
when
these
bowings
and
prostrations
are
over
a
small
apparatus
for
smoking
is
brought
in
and
placed
before
the
guest
after
which
tea
and
sweetmeats
are
served
perhaps
an
hour
passes
in
this
way
for
the
entertainment
is
provided
from
a
restaurant
as
the
domestic
who
performs
the
office
of
cook
in
a
household
only
knows
how
to
boil
rice
and
make
commonplace
stews
and
in
those
days
at
least
neither
clocks
nor
punctuality
were
common
if
you
were
invited
for
two
you
went
most
often
at
one
or
three
or
perhaps
later
in
fact
as
the
japanese
hour
altered
in
length
every
fortnight
it
was
very
difficult
to
be
certain
about
the
time
of
day
except
at
sunrise
noon
sunset
and
midnight
at
last
you
began
to
hear
a
gentle
clatter
of
dishes
below
stairs
the
teacups
cakes
and
sweetmeats
were
removed
and
a
covered
lacquered
basin
was
set
before
you
on
a
square
tray
with
a
pair
of
chopsticks
the
ends
of
which
were
neatly
wrapped
in
paper
at
the
same
time
a
girl
put
a
basin
half
full
of
water
down
on
the
middle
of
the
floor
with
a
small
pile
of
diminutive
flat
cups
by
the
side
your
host
took
one
of
these
held
it
out
for
a
little
of
the
hot
which
is
poured
from
a
slender
porcelain
bottle
and
having
drunk
it
slid
forward
to
the
basin
to
wash
it
having
well
shaken
it
he
crawled
to
where
you
were
sitting
bowed
profoundly
and
presented
the
cup
to
you
on
his
crossed
palms
you
bowed
and
taking
the
cup
between
your
own
two
hands
deposited
it
on
the
floor
after
which
you
were
bound
at
once
to
present
it
to
the
damsel
to
be
filled
for
yourself
if
your
host
or
one
of
the
guests
who
has
offered
you
the
cup
wished
to
be
very
polite
indeed
he
waited
before
you
with
his
hands
resting
on
the
floor
in
front
of
him
while
you
emptied
the
cup
or
at
least
took
a
good
sip
when
this
ceremony
had
been
gone
through
with
all
the
guests
your
host
lifted
the
cover
off
his
and
invited
you
at
the
same
time
to
follow
his
example
you
drank
a
little
of
the
soup
just
dipped
the
end
of
the
chopsticks
into
it
by
way
of
pretending
to
touch
the
meat
and
laid
down
the
bowl
again
usually
you
replaced
the
cover
a
number
of
dishes
were
brought
in
piled
up
with
white
beans
boiled
with
sugar
raw
broiled
and
boiled
fish
perhaps
some
boiled
fowl
or
roast
wild
duck
cut
up
in
small
pieces
and
these
were
served
on
small
plates
or
saucers
and
each
person
received
a
bowl
containing
a
sort
of
pudding
made
of
eggs
loach
and
the
large
seeds
of
the
maidenhair
tree
the
raw
fish
which
was
usually
either
or
sole
was
sliced
up
very
thin
and
eaten
with
soy
raw
laver
seaweed
and
grated
which
is
the
root
of
a
plant
belonging
to
the
same
order
as
the
and
resembling
it
in
taste
towards
the
end
of
the
feast
a
second
water
was
brought
in
and
perhaps
some
broiled
eels
the
courses
were
not
removed
as
each
succeeding
one
was
brought
in
and
the
plates
collected
on
your
tray
and
the
floor
close
by
you
till
all
the
extent
of
the
feast
was
exhibited
you
ate
very
little
picking
here
a
mouthful
there
a
mouthful
but
you
drank
as
much
as
you
could
stand
and
sometimes
more
after
two
or
three
hours
of
conversation
perhaps
enlivened
by
some
music
and
singing
performed
by
professionals
hired
for
the
occasion
and
you
felt
that
you
had
had
enough
liquor
you
bowed
to
your
host
and
said
that
you
would
like
some
rice
this
was
the
signal
a
fresh
tray
was
brought
in
with
a
large
lacquered
bowl
for
rice
and
a
couple
more
containing
soups
accompanied
almost
invariably
by
the
fish
of
ceremony
called
and
the
bigger
it
was
the
greater
the
honour
you
had
your
bowl
filled
with
rice
of
which
you
were
however
not
able
to
eat
much
as
your
appetite
had
been
nearly
destroyed
by
the
repeated
libations
of
warm
so
after
a
few
mouthfuls
you
handed
the
bowl
to
the
maid
who
filled
it
half
full
of
very
weak
tea
or
on
very
formal
occasions
with
hot
water
and
thus
you
managed
to
swallow
the
contents
aided
by
a
piece
of
salted
radish
or
vegetable
marrow
pickled
in
the
lees
of
that
over
you
carefully
replaced
the
covers
on
their
respective
bowls
pushed
the
tray
a
foot
or
two
away
from
you
and
executed
a
bow
of
profound
gratitude
to
your
entertainer
the
feast
was
then
removed
downstairs
where
all
the
portable
parts
of
it
were
packed
into
a
box
of
white
and
delivered
to
your
servant
if
you
had
one
in
your
train
to
carry
home
freshly
infused
tea
was
brought
in
after
which
you
thanked
your
host
for
the
feast
and
took
your
leave
being
accompanied
to
the
door
of
the
house
by
the
whole
family
to
whom
you
made
as
low
a
bow
as
possible
before
mounting
your
pony
or
entering
your
palanquin
for
the
next
six
or
seven
weeks
we
were
very
busy
arranging
with
the
japanese
the
details
of
a
scheme
for
organizing
their
navy
with
the
assistance
of
a
body
of
english
officers
who
were
to
be
sent
out
from
england
as
a
counterpoise
to
the
french
military
mission
which
had
been
at
work
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
and
for
the
establishment
of
a
college
to
be
superintended
by
a
body
of
graduates
from
english
universities
the
former
plan
was
successfully
carried
out
and
some
months
later
a
mission
under
the
command
of
commander
now
admiral
richard
tracey
arrived
in
japan
the
educational
proposal
however
came
to
nothing
ultimately
the
japanese
obtained
the
assistance
of
a
leading
american
missionary
residing
at
nagasaki
and
the
present
in
educational
system
was
in
fact
established
by
teachers
from
the
united
states
sir
harry
as
i
have
said
before
had
already
visited
tsuruga
which
was
suggested
as
a
possible
alternative
to
niigata
as
the
port
to
be
opened
on
the
west
coast
but
before
deciding
this
question
it
was
necessary
to
make
a
careful
examination
of
niigata
itself
so
in
the
latter
part
of
july
he
started
off
on
a
voyage
of
inspection
taking
mitford
and
myself
with
him
i
had
ono
seigorô
one
of
the
legation
writers
and
my
trusty
noguchi
with
me
we
left
yokohama
on
the
july
in
the
basilisk
commanded
by
captain
afterwards
sir
william
hewett
in
less
than
four
days
we
reached
hakodaté
where
the
usual
visits
were
exchanged
with
the
governor
a
little
man
named
koidé
yamato
no
kami
a
good
deal
was
said
about
the
coal
mine
at
iwanai
on
the
west
coast
of
yezo
at
which
a
commencement
of
working
had
recently
been
made
under
the
superintendence
of
my
friend
erasmus
gower
admiral
keppel
was
already
here
in
the
yacht
salamis
and
on
the
august
we
left
again
for
niigata
arriving
there
after
a
prosperous
voyage
of
hours
from
the
sea
the
view
of
niigata
is
very
fine
in
the
background
the
mountains
of
aidzu
rise
at
some
distance
inland
stretching
far
away
to
right
and
left
in
front
lies
a
level
plain
consisting
mainly
of
rice
fields
fringed
with
trees
the
foreground
is
a
sandy
shore
rising
into
sandhills
to
the
right
of
the
river
mouth
and
at
some
distance
to
the
west
the
prospect
terminates
in
the
lofty
peaks
of
yahiko
yama
i
landed
immediately
with
dr
wilson
of
the
basilisk
and
the
sea
being
quite
smooth
we
crossed
the
bar
without
difficulty
inside
the
water
is
very
deep
and
some
eighty
junks
were
lying
there
at
anchor
the
town
is
situated
a
little
way
up
the
river
not
quite
close
to
the
bank
we
chose
what
seemed
a
convenient
and
pushed
ashore
immediately
a
number
of
officials
made
their
appearance
and
forming
themselves
into
an
escort
led
the
way
to
a
buddhist
temple
the
reception
rooms
of
which
had
been
prepared
for
the
use
of
foreigners
after
we
had
waited
for
a
few
minutes
the
governor
came
in
he
proved
to
be
shiraishi
shimôsa
no
kami
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
when
he
held
a
similar
post
at
yokohama
in
and
in
those
days
we
used
often
to
have
serious
disputes
about
the
claims
of
british
subjects
against
defaulting
japanese
merchants
and
questions
of
customs
duties
but
i
found
him
now
in
quite
a
different
mood
he
was
very
polite
and
cheery
and
alluded
with
regret
to
the
ridiculous
arguments
which
in
former
days
under
a
different
régime
he
had
been
obliged
to
maintain
against
me
now
that
the
foreign
ministers
had
visited
the
tycoon
at
ozaka
all
was
to
be
changed
and
our
intercourse
was
to
be
really
friendly
he
had
himself
received
from
kiôto
a
copy
of
instructions
to
that
effect
after
some
further
talk
about
the
possibility
of
niigata
being
made
an
open
port
i
arranged
for
him
to
call
on
sir
harry
on
the
following
morning
on
board
the
basilisk
bringing
all
the
maps
in
his
possession
and
took
my
leave
on
our
way
back
to
the
ship
we
stopped
at
a
new
hotel
where
we
dined
in
japanese
fashion
and
made
some
purchases
of
the
curious
lacquered
articles
called
which
are
manufactured
in
aidzu
and
china
grass
cloth
woven
in
the
villages
further
inland
this
was
not
to
be
had
in
the
shops
but
was
hawked
about
the
town
by
people
from
the
country
here
for
the
first
time
i
saw
the
frozen
snow
which
in
those
days
was
the
japanese
substitute
for
ice
and
we
found
it
a
great
luxury
at
that
season
of
the
year
niigata
was
laid
out
in
the
form
of
the
truncated
segment
of
a
circle
and
intersected
by
canals
the
banks
of
which
were
lined
with
willow
trees
suggesting
a
dutch
model
the
canals
however
were
narrow
and
dirty
and
better
deserving
perhaps
the
name
of
ditches
at
this
moment
the
feast
of
tanabata
was
at
hand
and
the
streets
were
crowded
with
little
boys
carrying
paper
lanterns
of
all
sizes
and
colours
many
of
them
adorned
with
clever
sketches
in
colour
representing
japanese
historical
traditions
and
popular
customs
on
the
following
day
the
promised
interview
came
off
on
board
and
we
returned
the
governor
visit
in
the
afternoon
at
his
official
residence
he
had
hastily
had
some
benches
constructed
which
were
covered
with
red
cloth
the
best
substitute
procurable
for
chairs
old
shiraishi
renewed
acquaintance
with
me
some
twelve
years
later
at
tôkiô
and
used
to
give
me
lessons
in
the
interpretation
of
the
plays
his
son
became
my
librarian
and
died
in
my
house
after
a
two
hours
talk
we
started
off
to
inspect
an
island
in
the
river
which
it
was
proposed
should
be
converted
to
the
uses
of
a
foreign
settlement
sir
harry
who
was
of
an
active
inquisitive
temperament
here
signalized
himself
in
the
eyes
of
the
natives
by
scrambling
up
to
the
top
of
a
large
shed
under
which
a
junk
was
in
course
of
construction
to
get
a
view
of
the
surrounding
country
much
to
the
horror
of
mitford
and
myself
who
were
so
orientalized
by
this
time
in
our
notions
that
we
longed
to
see
our
chief
conduct
himself
with
the
impassive
dignity
of
a
japanese
gentleman
this
exploit
being
over
he
dragged
us
all
including
hewett
about
the
town
till
six
not
to
the
improvement
of
the
tempers
of
that
gallant
officer
or
of
his
boat
crew
who
thus
lost
their
dinner
i
remained
behind
with
noguchi
dined
again
in
japanese
fashion
and
spent
the
night
on
shore
in
the
enjoyment
of
a
few
hours
perfect
freedom
in
fact
i
did
not
return
to
the
ship
till
the
following
afternoon
and
then
had
some
difficulty
in
getting
off
as
there
was
a
heavy
swell
on
the
bar
though
outside
there
was
neither
wind
nor
rough
sea
from
niigata
we
crossed
over
to
the
island
of
sado
the
site
of
gold
mines
that
have
for
a
long
period
been
famous
the
japanese
proverb
is
that
the
soil
of
sado
is
the
most
effective
of
we
had
been
told
by
the
governor
of
niigata
that
there
was
a
good
port
here
where
foreign
vessels
could
lie
when
the
bar
at
the
mouth
of
the
shinano
river
was
too
rough
to
cross
owing
to
the
northwest
winds
that
prevail
during
the
winter
a
letter
had
been
sent
off
from
niigata
on
the
previous
day
to
announce
the
visit
of
the
british
minister
and
as
soon
as
we
let
go
our
anchor
some
of
the
local
officials
came
off
to
call
the
mines
however
lay
at
aikawa
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
where
the
governor
resided
he
had
sent
over
his
own
for
sir
harry
to
perform
the
journey
in
but
the
chief
did
not
relish
either
the
idea
of
locomotion
after
this
fashion
nor
yet
of
walking
across
the
island
and
of
passing
the
night
on
the
floor
of
a
japanese
house
in
native
quilts
and
with
nothing
better
than
rice
and
fish
to
eat
so
he
decided
to
send
me
across
in
his
stead
and
proceeded
round
to
aikawa
in
the
basilisk
this
arrangement
suited
me
down
to
the
ground
it
was
much
jollier
to
travel
by
self
than
to
play
second
fiddle
to
one
chief
always
the
distance
was
about
sixteen
miles
to
aikawa
and
the
officials
made
me
extremely
comfortable
for
the
night
next
day
sir
harry
and
a
large
party
including
some
of
the
officers
of
the
serpent
commander
bullock
and
aston
our
interpreter
landed
at
sawané
where
i
went
to
meet
them
and
we
walked
over
the
hills
to
the
village
near
the
mines
where
i
had
put
up
on
his
arrival
at
the
house
where
i
had
lodged
which
in
fact
had
been
prepared
for
his
reception
one
of
those
scenes
occurred
which
were
not
infrequent
in
those
days
when
the
japanese
tried
to
treat
foreigners
with
indignity
and
it
became
necessary
to
resent
their
impertinence
at
the
door
he
was
met
by
one
of
two
who
ushered
him
into
a
side
room
where
the
idea
was
that
he
should
do
till
the
governor
deigned
to
receive
him
but
sir
harry
was
equal
to
the
occasion
and
promptly
turning
round
without
saying
a
word
walked
out
of
the
house
i
overtook
him
at
the
gate
and
having
found
out
what
was
the
matter
was
on
my
way
back
to
tell
the
alarmed
officials
that
the
governor
must
receive
the
british
minister
at
the
door
of
the
house
when
i
met
the
two
hurrying
after
us
with
some
ridiculous
excuse
so
we
turned
back
walking
with
immense
dignity
so
as
to
give
him
time
and
by
the
time
we
arrived
back
again
the
old
fellow
made
his
appearance
beaming
with
smiles
as
if
nothing
had
happened
he
was
at
once
forgiven
and
led
the
way
into
a
large
room
where
a
long
row
of
chairs
extended
down
one
side
for
ourselves
faced
by
three
others
for
himself
and
the
we
speedily
became
great
friends
and
drank
a
quantity
of
together
sir
harry
and
the
governor
vying
with
each
other
in
the
manufacture
of
the
most
compliments
after
this
the
whole
party
adjourned
to
visit
the
gold
mines
which
were
then
whatever
they
may
be
now
burrows
half
full
of
water
and
those
who
ventured
in
returned
to
the
outer
air
again
looking
more
like
rabbits
than
human
englishmen
i
had
never
been
able
to
see
much
pleasure
in
this
sort
of
subterranean
excursion
and
carefully
stayed
outside
we
got
on
board
that
night
and
weighed
anchor
in
order
to
proceed
to
nanao
in
noto
there
a
fine
harbour
was
said
to
exist
which
we
thought
could
perhaps
be
substituted
for
niigata
early
on
the
morning
of
the
august
we
came
in
sight
of
the
lofty
mountains
of
etchiû
which
centre
round
the
volcanic
peak
of
tatéyama
nearly
feet
high
and
at
eleven
reached
the
southern
entrance
of
the
harbour
which
is
formed
by
a
considerable
island
lying
opposite
to
a
bay
the
serpent
led
the
way
in
discharge
of
the
functions
appertaining
to
her
as
a
surveying
ship
but
we
had
to
take
great
care
on
account
of
the
numerous
patches
of
shoal
water
and
did
not
come
to
an
anchor
in
front
of
the
town
till
twelve
nanao
or
tokoro
no
kuchi
at
that
time
containing
from
to
inhabitants
was
rising
into
importance
as
a
port
for
the
few
steamers
belonging
to
the
of
kaga
and
was
administered
by
a
or
prefect
named
abé
junjirô
he
was
a
young
man
who
had
been
to
nagasaki
and
knew
a
little
english
both
of
which
facts
in
those
days
gave
him
a
title
to
be
considered
travelled
and
learned
but
he
had
no
authority
to
speak
on
behalf
of
his
prince
we
therefore
waited
until
the
arrival
of
some
more
representative
officials
named
sano
and
satomi
who
were
expected
from
kanazawa
the
capital
of
this
daimiate
they
turned
up
on
board
the
basilisk
on
the
august
and
sat
talking
or
rather
being
talked
to
by
sir
harry
for
five
mortal
hours
the
chief
topic
was
the
question
of
the
suitability
of
nanao
as
a
substitute
for
niigata
what
the
kaga
people
feared
was
that
this
would
lead
to
its
being
taken
away
from
them
by
the
tycoon
government
as
in
former
times
had
happened
in
the
case
of
nagasaki
and
niigata
but
they
did
not
venture
to
state
this
openly
and
alleged
therefore
various
other
excuses
such
as
that
the
inhabitants
were
not
accustomed
to
see
foreigners
that
the
majority
would
object
on
account
of
the
general
rise
in
prices
which
would
follow
on
the
exportation
of
produce
and
the
however
willing
to
see
the
place
opened
to
foreign
trade
must
of
course
act
in
harmony
with
the
wishes
of
the
people
sir
harry
then
gave
up
pressing
the
point
directly
enlarged
on
the
inconveniences
of
the
anchorage
at
niigata
the
need
of
a
port
of
refuge
and
the
fact
that
none
existed
nearer
than
nanao
he
said
nothing
of
our
having
inspected
ebisu
minato
in
sado
with
the
view
of
using
it
as
an
alternative
anchorage
to
niigata
would
the
object
to
foreign
vessels
anchoring
at
nanao
when
the
weather
was
bad
at
the
bar
of
niigata
the
reply
was
that
for
the
sake
of
humanity
and
of
our
friendly
relations
he
would
be
unable
to
refuse
this
well
then
as
ships
could
not
afford
to
lie
a
long
time
at
nanao
doing
nothing
would
there
be
any
objection
to
their
cargoes
being
landed
and
stored
till
they
could
be
transported
to
niigata
no
probably
not
in
the
interests
of
humanity
who
then
asked
sir
harry
should
undertake
the
construction
of
the
necessary
warehouses
the
reply
was
that
either
foreigners
or
the
kaga
administration
could
do
this
as
seemed
most
convenient
well
then
supposing
that
the
people
of
nanao
should
wish
to
buy
any
of
the
goods
so
stored
by
foreigners
would
it
not
be
a
hard
thing
to
prevent
the
sale
they
said
perhaps
it
might
be
but
to
give
such
permission
would
lead
to
converting
nanao
into
a
foreign
trading
port
nevertheless
if
all
the
articles
required
were
ordered
beforehand
and
not
selected
from
those
stored
with
a
view
to
their
transportation
to
niigata
there
could
be
no
objection
but
in
actual
fact
to
speak
frankly
they
thought
they
could
undertake
the
regulation
of
the
port
and
the
storage
of
goods
without
the
assistance
of
the
tycoon
government
the
territory
of
nanao
had
belonged
to
the
maeda
clan
from
very
early
times
it
was
the
only
good
port
in
the
three
provinces
of
kaga
etchiû
and
noto
and
could
ill
be
spared
they
would
dislike
to
share
the
local
administration
with
the
government
nor
could
they
give
it
up
to
them
altogether
sir
harry
expressed
his
concurrence
in
these
views
and
then
proceeded
to
talk
about
the
means
of
transport
for
himself
and
his
party
overland
to
ozaka
this
subject
had
been
discussed
in
the
legation
before
our
departure
from
yedo
though
when
the
governor
of
niigata
had
asked
sir
harry
whether
it
was
not
his
intention
to
return
by
land
from
nanao
our
very
diplomatic
chief
had
replied
that
such
an
idea
had
never
entered
his
head
they
received
his
suggestion
with
no
marks
of
cordiality
and
drew
on
themselves
a
severe
rebuke
for
their
want
of
friendship
towards
foreigners
so
different
to
the
feelings
displayed
by
certain
other
clans
this
plain
speaking
completely
spoiled
their
temper
they
became
very
sulky
and
silent
and
alleging
hunger
probably
with
much
truth
took
their
departure
as
soon
as
they
had
left
the
ship
sir
harry
made
up
his
mind
to
send
mitford
and
myself
overland
to
ozaka
while
he
went
round
by
way
of
nagasaki
in
the
basilisk
it
was
of
course
evident
that
we
could
travel
through
the
country
in
a
much
less
formal
style
than
would
be
necessary
for
him
and
on
our
part
of
course
we
were
only
too
delighted
to
get
the
opportunity
of
seeing
a
part
of
the
interior
where
foreigners
had
never
been
before
i
was
therefore
sent
on
shore
to
get
hold
of
the
prefect
bullock
was
ordered
to
remain
behind
with
the
serpent
to
make
a
complete
survey
of
the
bay
the
admiral
who
had
arrived
from
niigata
the
day
before
us
got
up
steam
in
the
salamis
and
was
off
at
three
the
basilisk
following
a
couple
of
hours
later
the
chief
who
liked
to
keep
us
by
him
till
the
last
moment
took
us
as
far
as
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
where
we
put
our
traps
into
a
boat
belonging
to
the
serpent
but
just
as
we
were
pulling
away
the
basilisk
got
ashore
in
a
shallow
place
and
they
signalled
to
us
to
return
to
her
eventually
we
were
released
from
dancing
attendance
on
him
and
reached
the
shore
at
eight
in
the
evening
we
proceeded
to
a
house
where
i
had
more
than
once
passed
the
night
and
shortly
received
a
visit
from
sano
and
abé
who
were
to
make
all
the
arrangements
for
our
journey
thither
came
also
two
officials
of
the
yedo
foreign
department
who
had
come
from
yokohama
with
sir
harry
and
whom
he
had
left
behind
with
injunctions
to
facilitate
the
survey
of
the
harbour
by
bullock
but
as
soon
as
they
heard
that
we
were
going
overland
they
conceived
the
plan
of
offering
that
one
of
them
should
accompany
us
to
spy
upon
our
movements
they
alleged
that
although
everything
might
go
well
with
us
in
the
territories
of
the
of
kaga
we
should
meet
with
difficulties
further
on
we
should
be
unable
to
procure
baggage
and
palanquin
coolies
we
might
be
attacked
and
killed
they
had
instructions
in
fact
to
accompany
us
wherever
we
went
on
shore
and
that
it
was
a
law
of
japan
that
foreigners
must
not
travel
without
foreign
department
officials
to
look
after
them
to
this
i
replied
with
equal
weight
that
they
were
bound
to
respect
the
injunctions
laid
on
them
by
sir
harry
to
whom
they
had
been
lent
by
the
tycoon
council
he
had
told
them
to
remain
at
nanao
for
a
specific
purpose
while
we
had
positive
orders
from
our
chief
not
to
take
them
we
felt
assured
that
the
of
kaga
and
echizen
which
was
the
territory
that
lay
immediately
beyond
would
do
everything
to
smooth
our
way
and
as
regarded
the
rest
of
the
line
of
road
they
might
write
to
the
tycoon
people
at
kiôto
to
send
down
the
necessary
instructions
and
even
take
on
themselves
the
responsibility
of
transmitting
the
orders
direct
to
the
authorities
of
the
towns
we
should
have
to
pass
through
as
for
the
law
they
mentioned
i
felt
convinced
that
it
had
no
existence
at
best
there
was
only
a
custom
to
that
effect
which
we
could
decline
to
abide
by
at
our
option
these
considerations
proved
to
them
that
argument
would
not
help
them
so
they
tried
to
work
upon
my
feelings
by
representing
that
they
would
get
into
hot
water
with
their
superiors
in
yedo
if
they
suffered
us
to
depart
alone
but
this
also
failed
finally
they
washed
their
hands
of
the
business
and
begged
to
be
excused
from
all
responsibility
for
any
difficulties
we
might
encounter
this
request
was
most
readily
granted
and
they
retired
with
a
secret
intention
of
getting
bullock
to
dispense
with
their
services
while
we
betook
ourselves
to
our
beds
with
the
consciousness
of
a
victory
achieved
chapter
xx
nanao
to
ozaka
overland
next
morning
sano
and
abé
presented
themselves
with
the
welcome
news
that
everything
was
ready
for
our
journey
and
made
many
apologies
for
the
inconveniences
we
should
have
to
put
up
with
they
had
provided
a
handsome
palanquin
for
each
of
us
and
ordinary
ones
for
noguchi
and
mitford
chinese
servant
the
philosophic
a
guard
was
furnished
of
twenty
men
carrying
long
staves
under
the
command
of
an
officer
named
tominaga
we
got
away
at
eight
looking
out
to
sea
we
perceived
that
the
basilisk
had
departed
and
that
the
serpent
was
lying
peacefully
at
anchor
the
foreign
department
officials
did
not
show
up
and
it
was
to
be
concluded
that
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
submit
so
we
were
perfectly
free
away
from
our
chief
from
tycoon
officials
from
any
other
europeans
embarked
on
an
adventure
in
a
totally
unknown
part
of
the
country
which
might
end
anyhow
for
aught
we
cared
but
at
any
rate
was
of
an
altogether
novel
character
as
soon
as
we
were
clear
of
the
town
we
got
out
and
walked
it
was
a
piping
hot
day
each
man
of
the
twenty
who
formed
the
escort
as
he
went
along
fanned
himself
with
one
hand
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
with
a
towel
carried
in
the
other
it
soon
became
evident
that
we
were
to
be
treated
with
great
distinction
for
we
had
not
travelled
more
than
an
hour
and
a
half
before
we
were
invited
to
rest
and
refresh
ourselves
with
delicious
water
melons
and
tea
nectarines
were
also
offered
but
of
such
fearful
unripeness
that
we
dared
not
make
their
close
acquaintance
an
hour
further
we
had
again
to
rest
every
one
was
excessively
polite
the
peasants
whom
we
met
were
made
to
crouch
down
and
take
off
their
hats
this
was
much
more
than
could
have
been
expected
after
the
scolding
sir
harry
had
given
to
sano
and
his
colleagues
on
the
previous
day
the
road
lay
up
a
gradually
narrowing
valley
cultivated
principally
with
rape
and
hemp
at
a
quarter
past
one
we
stopped
for
lunch
at
a
clean
inn
where
they
gave
us
a
capital
meal
after
a
nap
we
resumed
our
way
at
three
down
another
valley
stopped
to
rest
at
four
and
reached
our
night
quarters
at
six
having
accomplished
eighteen
miles
this
was
the
village
of
shiwo
prettily
situated
on
the
banks
of
a
tiny
stream
and
close
to
the
mouth
of
a
valley
the
view
up
which
into
the
hills
growing
ever
higher
and
higher
was
one
of
the
charming
prospects
in
which
japan
abounds
after
the
hot
bath
they
served
an
excellent
dinner
with
many
polite
apologies
for
its
badness
the
next
day
brought
us
some
sixteen
miles
further
to
tsubata
where
we
joined
the
high
road
which
traverses
the
dominions
of
the
from
one
end
to
the
other
at
no
great
distance
from
the
coast
here
our
escort
left
us
and
a
new
set
of
men
took
their
place
we
were
now
passing
through
a
more
populous
part
of
the
country
and
were
objects
of
intense
curiosity
to
the
inhabitants
at
morimoto
the
front
rooms
of
the
houses
on
both
sides
of
the
street
were
filled
with
spectators
sitting
in
rows
three
or
four
deep
or
on
mats
placed
at
the
side
of
the
roadway
shortly
after
leaving
this
place
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
white
castle
walls
of
kanazawa
peeping
through
the
pine
trees
as
soon
as
we
came
in
sight
of
the
town
itself
we
got
into
our
palanquins
and
were
carried
to
one
of
the
first
houses
where
we
met
satomi
and
another
official
named
tsunékawa
crowds
of
spectators
had
assembled
and
some
of
them
were
so
eager
to
gratify
their
curiosity
that
they
even
stood
in
a
muddy
lotus
pond
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
back
of
the
house
where
we
were
here
delicious
melons
and
apples
were
served
with
frozen
snow
from
the
mountains
behind
the
town
gold
paper
screens
lined
the
walls
there
were
tables
piled
high
with
fruit
and
cakes
and
in
the
recess
behind
the
seat
of
honour
a
beautiful
writing
box
of
the
finest
gold
lacquer
in
case
we
wished
to
sit
down
and
write
letters
a
most
unnecessary
piece
of
ceremonial
preparation
one
would
say
the
officials
asked
us
to
proceed
from
here
on
foot
in
order
that
the
people
might
see
us
better
but
we
preferred
making
use
of
our
palanquins
as
we
had
on
our
travelling
garments
and
were
somewhat
dusty
and
the
streets
were
thickly
lined
with
spectators
of
all
ranks
and
ages
among
whom
were
some
very
pretty
girls
another
charming
resting
place
had
been
prepared
for
us
into
which
they
obliged
us
to
turn
aside
although
we
had
previously
expressed
our
wish
to
go
on
straight
to
the
inn
continuing
thence
along
the
street
thickly
filled
with
inquisitive
but
perfectly
orderly
townspeople
we
crossed
a
bridge
and
after
turning
a
few
times
to
right
and
left
at
last
reached
our
inn
rather
tired
with
all
the
fuss
and
ceremony
at
the
porch
we
were
welcomed
by
satomi
who
had
hurried
on
ahead
to
superintend
our
reception
he
conducted
us
through
several
rooms
into
an
inner
room
of
great
size
spread
with
a
huge
carpet
and
furnished
with
chinese
tables
and
chairs
such
as
the
high
priests
of
buddhist
temples
occupy
on
grand
ceremonial
occasions
the
host
immediately
presented
himself
bowing
his
head
to
the
floor
as
if
he
were
saluting
a
pair
of
kings
each
servant
who
brought
in
the
tobacco
trays
or
tea
bowed
low
to
the
ground
then
advanced
holding
the
article
high
in
both
hands
deposited
it
on
the
table
and
then
retiring
backwards
to
the
edge
of
the
carpet
knocked
his
head
on
the
floor
again
before
withdrawing
we
were
conducted
in
turn
to
the
bath
with
great
ceremony
and
then
put
on
our
best
clothes
which
were
neither
new
nor
good
to
receive
visitors
the
first
to
call
was
a
special
messenger
from
the
to
express
a
hope
that
we
had
not
suffered
from
the
heat
and
rejoicing
at
our
fortunate
arrival
mitford
replied
with
great
dignity
that
we
had
not
felt
the
heat
we
were
deeply
grateful
for
the
hospitality
and
kindness
shown
to
us
and
would
like
to
call
on
the
to
thank
him
in
person
my
master
said
the
messenger
is
unfortunately
indisposed
otherwise
he
would
have
been
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
mitford
expressed
a
hope
that
he
would
soon
recover
the
real
truth
i
imagine
to
have
been
that
an
interview
between
a
and
two
foreigners
would
have
involved
far
too
important
and
complicated
decisions
on
questions
of
etiquette
for
it
to
be
lightly
contemplated
the
messenger
added
that
he
had
been
commanded
by
his
master
to
offer
us
a
small
entertainment
and
to
accompany
us
in
partaking
of
it
mitford
rose
to
even
greater
heights
of
flowery
speech
than
before
and
invented
a
message
from
sir
harry
parkes
which
if
the
chief
did
not
actually
charge
us
with
the
omission
could
only
be
attributed
to
inadvertence
expressing
his
desire
to
swear
eternal
friendship
with
the
and
people
of
kaga
which
gave
very
great
satisfaction
to
the
messenger
and
everyone
else
present
doctors
were
also
introduced
whom
the
prince
had
deputed
to
attend
on
us
in
case
we
felt
any
from
the
heat
to
this
exchange
of
compliments
succeeded
a
feast
resembling
in
character
what
has
already
been
described
but
far
surpassing
it
in
magnificence
and
the
number
of
courses
observing
that
our
japanese
entertainers
were
not
comfortable
on
their
chairs
we
proposed
to
banish
the
furniture
and
squat
on
the
floor
after
the
manner
of
the
country
and
thus
facilitate
the
passing
of
the
cup
after
a
considerable
time
had
been
passed
in
general
conversation
and
everyone
head
was
more
or
less
heated
we
introduced
political
topics
which
were
discussed
very
confidentially
in
the
presence
of
a
crowd
of
people
the
structure
of
a
japanese
house
is
such
that
no
secrets
can
be
whispered
there
is
always
some
one
listening
behind
a
paper
partition
or
on
the
other
side
of
a
screen
and
if
you
wish
to
hatch
a
plot
your
best
way
is
to
transfer
your
deliberations
to
the
middle
of
the
garden
where
you
can
keep
off
eavesdroppers
however
as
we
could
not
do
that
on
the
present
occasion
it
seemed
better
to
take
all
who
chose
it
into
our
confidence
the
gist
of
the
conversation
amounted
to
this
that
the
kaga
people
wished
to
trade
with
foreigners
but
did
not
wish
avowedly
to
make
an
open
port
of
nanao
because
the
tycoon
government
would
then
try
to
deprive
them
of
it
but
they
would
agree
to
its
being
an
anchorage
for
foreign
vessels
ancillary
to
niigata
and
to
goods
being
landed
there
in
which
case
everything
else
would
naturally
follow
if
the
tycoon
government
were
to
inquire
what
view
they
took
of
the
question
they
would
reply
ambiguously
our
answer
was
that
of
course
we
desired
to
act
in
harmony
with
the
wishes
of
the
and
would
do
nothing
that
could
possibly
be
prejudicial
to
his
interests
this
proved
very
satisfactory
to
our
entertainers
who
declared
the
warm
feelings
of
friendship
for
us
which
animated
them
and
a
stratagem
the
details
of
which
i
do
not
recollect
was
agreed
upon
for
keeping
up
secret
and
confidential
communications
with
them
after
our
return
to
yedo
both
sides
bound
themselves
to
secrecy
and
the
party
broke
up
the
bedding
which
was
of
the
most
magnificent
description
was
then
brought
in
piles
of
soft
quilted
mattresses
covered
with
silk
or
crape
and
stuffed
with
silk
wool
and
a
large
net
of
silk
gauze
was
hung
up
to
keep
off
the
mosquitoes
then
a
pot
of
green
tea
with
teacups
on
a
small
tray
and
the
necessary
apparatus
for
smoking
were
gently
slid
under
the
bottom
of
the
mosquito
curtain
and
the
people
of
the
house
wished
us
a
good
night
rest
in
the
morning
the
very
first
thing
before
we
were
awake
the
same
elements
of
a
comfortable
existence
were
provided
in
the
same
unobtrusive
manner
the
forenoon
was
spent
in
choosing
lacquer
and
porcelain
on
the
previous
evening
an
arrangement
had
been
made
for
our
visiting
the
neighbouring
hills
but
some
hitch
had
occurred
and
we
were
now
asked
to
accept
instead
an
excursion
to
kanaiwa
the
port
of
kanazawa
it
lay
at
a
distance
of
about
five
miles
so
we
started
on
horseback
about
three
our
steeds
were
rather
ponies
unshod
with
saddles
in
the
european
fashion
covered
with
thick
black
paper
instead
of
leather
and
painfully
stiff
bridles
of
badly
tanned
leather
noguchi
was
mounted
on
a
pony
splendidly
caparisoned
in
the
native
style
and
the
philosophic
who
could
not
ride
was
put
into
a
palanquin
though
we
had
such
a
very
short
way
to
ride
it
was
supposed
that
delicately
nurtured
persons
like
ourselves
would
feel
the
fatigue
and
three
resting
places
had
been
prepared
two
on
the
road
and
one
at
kanaiwa
itself
the
port
proved
to
be
an
open
roadstead
at
the
mouth
of
an
insignificant
stream
quite
useless
except
in
perfectly
calm
weather
at
dinner
that
evening
we
had
some
further
talk
with
a
couple
of
officials
they
had
come
to
the
conclusion
after
thinking
over
the
conversation
of
the
previous
evening
that
it
would
be
their
wisest
course
to
admit
to
the
tycoon
government
the
probability
of
a
certain
amount
of
trade
taking
place
at
nanao
in
that
way
no
danger
would
arise
of
their
getting
into
trouble
for
what
would
otherwise
be
smuggling
we
approved
of
this
proposal
and
suggested
their
sending
to
yedo
some
one
authorized
to
treat
with
the
government
and
the
foreign
representatives
in
the
course
of
conversation
on
the
domestic
politics
of
the
country
they
said
that
in
their
opinion
the
tycoon
government
ought
to
be
supported
and
not
done
away
with
altogether
as
the
satsuma
and
chôshiû
people
with
other
clans
were
believed
to
be
advocating
but
at
the
same
time
limits
ought
to
be
placed
on
its
authority
they
had
read
my
pamphlet
and
entirely
approved
of
the
suggestions
it
contained
after
that
all
one
could
say
was
that
we
entirely
concurred
in
the
views
of
the
kaga
clan
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
people
were
rather
too
remote
from
the
main
centre
of
political
thought
to
be
cognisant
of
or
sympathise
with
the
aspirations
of
the
southern
and
western
clans
they
lay
in
an
isolated
position
on
the
northern
coast
in
a
part
of
the
country
that
had
always
been
looked
upon
somewhat
as
the
home
of
ignorance
and
want
of
culture
they
cared
only
for
themselves
the
lands
held
by
the
of
kaga
were
assessed
at
a
much
greater
annual
value
than
the
fief
of
any
other
prince
which
gave
the
clansmen
an
importance
in
the
eyes
of
the
rest
of
the
world
with
which
they
were
thoroughly
satisfied
an
alteration
in
the
political
organization
of
the
country
could
hardly
benefit
them
and
they
were
at
bottom
disposed
to
be
contented
with
the
the
british
legation
on
the
contrary
were
determined
that
so
far
as
their
influence
went
the
mikado
should
be
restored
to
the
headship
of
the
nation
so
that
our
treaties
might
receive
a
sanction
that
no
one
would
venture
to
dispute
and
for
this
purpose
it
was
necessary
that
the
constitution
of
the
tycoon
government
should
be
modified
in
such
a
manner
as
to
admit
the
principal
or
clans
rather
to
a
share
in
the
distribution
of
power
our
hosts
would
have
been
contented
to
keep
us
longer
but
we
were
due
at
ozaka
at
a
fixed
date
and
could
not
stay
with
them
we
resumed
our
journey
therefore
on
the
morning
of
august
the
landlord
was
very
urgent
with
us
that
we
should
call
in
passing
at
a
shop
for
patent
medicines
kept
by
a
relation
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
a
preparation
called
purple
snow
composed
chiefly
of
nitre
and
perfumed
with
musk
and
believed
to
be
a
remedy
for
most
of
the
ills
to
which
flesh
is
heir
the
streets
were
again
crowded
with
eager
spectators
when
just
clear
of
the
town
we
were
forced
to
alight
from
our
for
a
parting
feast
at
a
restaurant
on
a
height
commanding
a
picturesque
view
of
the
castle
which
planted
plentifully
with
trees
presented
a
aspect
very
unlike
the
grim
fortresses
which
in
europe
usually
go
by
the
name
here
we
spent
an
hour
eating
fish
and
drinking
and
vowing
eternal
friendship
with
the
kaga
clansmen
with
whom
previous
to
this
visit
we
had
had
no
intercourse
whatever
we
lunched
that
day
at
mattô
where
i
had
a
long
talk
with
the
mayor
upon
things
in
general
in
the
presence
of
a
vast
and
attentive
crowd
and
reached
komatsu
in
the
evening
having
accomplished
twenty
miles
this
was
very
fair
going
considering
the
numerous
delays
and
stoppages
for
refreshment
the
next
day
we
passed
the
boundary
line
between
the
territories
of
kanazawa
and
daishôji
where
the
escort
was
changed
at
the
latter
town
we
found
the
streets
entirely
cleared
and
crowds
of
people
quietly
sitting
in
the
front
rooms
of
the
houses
among
them
many
daughters
of
the
best
families
in
holiday
garb
with
wreaths
of
silver
flowers
on
their
heads
their
faces
nicely
powdered
with
white
lead
and
their
lips
stained
with
the
safflower
dye
which
imparts
such
a
curious
metallic
lustre
to
the
skin
here
we
took
a
formal
farewell
of
okada
and
shimbô
two
kaga
gentlemen
who
had
accompanied
us
during
the
previous
days
mitford
chinese
servant
came
in
for
a
share
in
the
general
and
philosophically
remarked
that
he
did
not
understand
japanese
etiquette
which
appears
to
consist
chiefly
in
the
performance
of
the
about
three
miles
further
we
finally
quitted
the
domains
of
the
maeda
family
and
passed
into
the
territory
of
echizen
there
was
no
guard
to
meet
us
only
a
couple
of
policemen
and
it
was
proposed
that
we
should
retrace
our
steps
to
a
half
a
mile
back
to
wait
till
an
escort
could
be
procured
to
this
we
objected
saying
that
we
were
willing
to
go
on
without
a
guard
the
or
head
bailiff
of
the
of
daishôji
said
that
it
would
not
be
correct
for
his
men
to
undertake
our
protection
beyond
the
limits
finally
a
compromise
was
effected
okada
and
shimbô
who
in
spite
of
the
formal
parting
that
had
taken
place
at
daishôji
were
still
of
the
party
borrowed
ten
men
from
the
bailiff
on
the
distinct
understanding
that
they
were
not
any
longer
a
guard
and
walked
on
with
us
shortly
afterwards
we
met
an
echizen
official
of
low
rank
he
was
a
or
assistant
clerk
and
our
kaga
friends
took
their
final
leave
of
us
not
without
expressing
the
opinion
that
the
echizen
people
showed
very
little
courtesy
in
not
deputing
some
one
of
more
exalted
rank
to
offer
us
a
welcome
but
the
fact
was
we
were
not
welcome
at
all
as
we
speedily
found
for
although
every
possible
pains
had
been
taken
to
provide
us
with
good
food
and
quarters
the
whole
echizen
clan
held
aloof
from
us
for
instance
at
kanadzu
where
we
passed
the
night
the
whole
town
was
illuminated
with
coloured
lanterns
and
the
spectators
who
crowded
the
main
street
went
down
on
their
knees
in
the
usual
respectful
manner
very
beautiful
guest
rooms
had
been
prepared
for
us
at
a
monastery
chairs
and
tables
had
been
provided
and
a
couple
of
good
little
boys
of
preternaturally
solemn
demeanour
sat
on
the
floor
behind
us
to
fan
away
the
mosquitoes
the
superior
civilization
and
resources
of
the
country
as
compared
with
kaga
were
exhibited
by
the
production
of
beer
and
champagne
next
day
we
reached
fukui
the
capital
of
the
province
a
town
of
about
inhabitants
here
again
the
streets
had
been
cleared
spectators
in
their
best
were
seated
in
rows
in
the
shops
and
looked
just
as
if
they
had
paid
for
their
places
like
the
people
who
go
to
see
the
queen
open
parliament
i
never
saw
so
many
pretty
girls
together
anywhere
white
brooms
and
buckets
of
water
stood
before
each
house
as
a
sign
that
the
road
had
been
swept
clean
and
the
dust
laid
we
were
conducted
to
the
monastery
of
the
hongwanji
sect
a
new
and
handsome
building
where
a
large
room
had
been
prepared
for
us
and
hung
with
silk
crape
curtains
dyed
with
the
echizen
crest
in
the
recess
stood
a
beautiful
vase
containing
a
huge
bouquet
of
lotus
flowers
standing
quite
six
feet
high
the
table
was
loaded
with
piles
of
fruit
and
cakes
and
the
usual
japanese
luncheon
was
served
with
champagne
no
one
approached
us
with
the
exception
of
a
young
japanese
who
had
been
in
the
service
of
a
foreigner
at
nagasaki
and
spoke
a
little
english
but
numbers
of
officials
some
of
high
rank
collected
in
the
passages
to
stare
at
us
we
took
no
notice
of
them
adopting
the
perfectly
cold
and
impassive
manner
of
orientals
on
their
dignity
this
was
bad
but
worse
came
behind
although
on
our
quitting
fukui
they
sent
men
before
us
to
sweep
the
road
ahead
our
guards
were
rude
and
chaffed
about
us
among
themselves
at
fuchiû
the
town
where
we
stopped
for
the
night
a
noisy
crowd
pursued
us
from
the
entrance
of
the
town
to
our
lodging
running
along
the
other
side
of
the
stream
which
lay
along
the
middle
of
the
street
arrived
at
the
inn
we
found
the
dais
room
shut
up
and
the
matted
floors
spread
with
a
sort
of
thick
tough
paper
in
sheets
which
is
laid
down
when
any
particularly
dirty
household
business
is
to
take
place
it
is
the
correlative
of
the
dust
sheets
used
in
england
to
cover
up
furniture
when
a
weekly
cleaning
takes
place
we
were
of
course
indignant
but
i
think
these
to
us
offensive
precautions
had
been
taken
in
the
belief
that
we
were
ignorant
of
japanese
manners
and
customs
and
would
walk
in
with
our
shoes
on
the
day
after
this
we
crossed
the
boundary
on
the
top
of
a
hill
called
the
tochinoki
tôgé
pass
where
we
said
to
the
rude
echizen
escort
and
were
taken
charge
of
by
men
belonging
to
ii
kamon
no
kami
the
of
hikoné
a
very
moderate
bill
was
presented
to
us
for
our
board
lodging
and
coolie
hire
which
we
paid
and
we
offered
payment
also
for
the
extras
in
the
shape
of
beer
champagne
and
fish
but
could
not
induce
the
officials
to
accept
it
it
is
not
very
easy
to
explain
why
the
echizen
people
showed
such
an
utter
want
of
cordiality
but
i
think
it
may
perhaps
be
attributable
to
the
difficult
position
in
which
the
clan
then
stood
its
head
was
closely
allied
to
the
tycoon
family
being
in
fact
descended
from
one
of
the
sons
of
iyéyasu
the
founder
of
the
tycoonate
although
perfectly
well
aware
of
the
difficulties
in
which
the
tycoon
was
involved
he
was
not
prepared
to
side
with
the
satsuma
and
chôshiû
party
which
aimed
at
the
restoration
of
the
mikado
and
was
probably
acquainted
with
the
policy
of
the
british
legation
as
supposed
to
be
set
forth
in
my
pamphlet
intimacy
with
foreigners
had
never
until
quite
lately
been
a
part
of
the
government
programme
and
the
echizen
people
very
likely
thought
it
wiser
to
hold
entirely
aloof
from
us
in
spite
of
the
recent
change
of
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
tycoon
especially
as
the
had
never
openly
adhered
to
the
policy
of
friendship
with
foreigners
the
expulsion
of
the
barbarians
was
still
their
ostensible
party
cry
so
that
on
the
whole
i
incline
to
the
opinion
that
extreme
caution
was
the
keynote
to
the
want
of
cordiality
displayed
by
the
echizen
folk
we
stopped
that
night
at
a
little
village
among
the
hills
called
where
we
could
get
nothing
to
eat
but
rice
and
tea
in
ordinary
years
there
are
no
mosquitoes
here
owing
to
its
elevation
and
we
had
therefore
considerable
trouble
in
procuring
mosquito
curtains
the
general
aspect
of
the
country
reminded
me
closely
of
scawfell
pass
in
cumberland
at
the
further
foot
of
the
hills
we
passed
one
of
those
barriers
curious
relics
of
a
past
full
of
suspicion
where
no
woman
was
allowed
to
pass
and
where
every
man
had
to
exhibit
a
passport
at
nagahama
we
met
an
official
of
the
tycoon
government
named
tsukahara
kwanjirô
brother
of
tsukahara
tajima
no
kami
with
eighteen
of
the
foreign
guard
who
henceforward
charged
themselves
with
our
protection
sir
harry
parkes
had
passed
through
here
in
may
last
in
returning
from
his
visit
to
tsuruga
and
we
found
the
people
disposed
to
be
familiar
and
careless
of
our
comfort
we
felt
that
we
were
now
little
better
than
prisoners
farewell
all
jollity
and
all
politeness
on
the
part
of
the
inhabitants
we
hastened
on
as
rapidly
as
possible
being
now
as
anxious
to
get
over
the
rest
of
our
journey
as
we
had
in
the
beginning
been
disposed
to
loiter
among
a
friendly
population
at
takamiya
where
we
lunched
we
found
the
dais
room
closed
against
us
but
i
took
the
innkeeper
and
his
servants
roundly
to
task
and
made
them
open
it
after
this
they
recognized
that
we
understood
japanese
etiquette
and
for
their
previous
rudeness
substituted
perfect
courtesy
as
we
were
now
about
to
quit
the
territory
of
ii
kamon
no
kami
we
offered
to
settle
our
bill
for
lodging
and
coolie
hire
but
the
official
in
charge
refused
to
accept
payment
alleging
that
he
had
received
reiterated
orders
not
to
take
anything
from
us
so
we
contented
ourselves
with
addressing
to
him
a
letter
of
acknowledgment
and
told
him
we
would
thank
the
people
on
our
return
to
yedo
the
local
escort
left
us
at
nakajiku
the
boundary
and
we
were
consigned
to
the
care
of
the
foreign
guard
who
concerned
themselves
very
little
on
our
behalf
the
consequence
of
this
was
that
the
people
crowded
in
upon
us
at
every
village
and
were
extremely
rude
in
their
behaviour
on
our
arrival
at
musa
i
administered
a
quiet
to
the
commander
of
the
guard
who
promised
that
things
should
be
better
arranged
for
the
morrow
next
day
we
reached
kusatsu
where
to
our
surprise
we
fell
in
with
a
couple
more
tycoon
officials
whom
i
knew
very
well
takabataké
gorô
and
a
young
fellow
named
koméda
keijirô
the
latter
of
whom
spoke
english
remarkably
well
they
told
us
that
they
had
come
overland
from
yedo
with
hirayama
dzusho
no
kami
one
of
the
tycoon
second
council
and
had
been
dropped
here
by
him
to
look
after
us
he
had
charged
them
to
say
to
us
that
the
temple
of
ishiyama
just
below
the
seta
bridge
which
had
been
closed
to
sir
harry
in
may
would
be
shown
to
us
and
was
well
worthy
of
a
visit
this
temple
in
fact
lay
on
the
route
which
tsukahara
had
already
persuaded
us
to
adopt
we
were
to
take
boat
at
kusatsu
descend
the
river
which
flows
out
of
the
biwa
lake
as
far
as
the
rapids
then
walk
for
about
a
couple
of
leagues
five
miles
and
take
boat
again
to
fushimi
this
he
said
was
a
much
shorter
and
pleasanter
route
than
that
which
wirgman
and
i
had
taken
in
may
we
therefore
jumped
at
the
offer
made
on
the
part
of
hirayama
whom
we
voted
a
capital
fellow
and
some
amicable
conversation
followed
on
japanese
politics
in
which
they
tried
to
persuade
us
that
the
positions
taken
up
by
my
pamphlet
were
all
wrong
but
without
success
after
they
left
noguchi
came
to
me
and
said
that
the
road
over
the
hills
to
uji
instead
of
being
only
ten
or
twelve
miles
as
had
been
represented
to
us
was
in
reality
much
nearer
so
that
we
could
not
possibly
get
there
by
a
misgiving
immediately
arose
in
my
mind
that
there
was
something
concealed
behind
all
this
solicitude
about
our
seeing
temples
probably
the
tycoon
officials
wanted
to
get
us
away
from
otsu
which
lay
on
the
direct
route
and
the
vicinity
of
kiôto
in
order
to
prevent
trouble
with
the
party
such
as
had
occurred
in
may
when
sir
harry
passed
through
there
i
therefore
despatched
noguchi
to
probe
tsukahara
and
sent
for
the
posting
officer
to
inquire
about
the
distances
what
he
told
me
only
confirmed
my
suspicions
which
i
then
mentioned
to
mitford
we
therefore
resolved
to
go
by
otsu
and
to
run
all
risks
we
had
invited
takabataké
and
the
other
man
to
dinner
just
before
our
guests
arrived
noguchi
returned
and
i
imparted
my
suspicions
to
him
he
thought
i
was
wrong
as
soon
as
they
came
in
i
announced
to
takabataké
our
intention
of
taking
the
usual
route
he
was
greatly
disconcerted
declared
it
would
be
very
inconvenient
nay
impossible
i
replied
that
we
were
indifferent
to
temples
and
scenery
but
extremely
fond
of
saving
time
in
travelling
and
as
the
road
by
otsu
was
the
shorter
we
would
take
it
seeing
that
we
were
very
firm
in
our
resolve
he
retired
from
the
room
and
got
hold
of
noguchi
whom
he
begged
to
use
his
influence
noguchi
thereupon
called
me
outside
for
a
private
conversation
and
urged
me
to
adhere
to
the
original
arrangement
i
replied
that
it
was
useless
we
wanted
to
go
by
the
shorter
route
and
if
altering
the
arrangements
as
to
boats
cost
money
we
were
willing
to
pay
it
i
returned
to
the
and
my
answer
was
communicated
to
takabataké
who
thereupon
called
out
koméda
koméda
came
back
and
begged
me
in
turn
to
come
out
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
he
said
that
he
wished
to
have
a
friendly
talk
and
confessed
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
plant
i
said
that
we
knew
it
before
and
had
felt
convinced
that
tsukahara
had
been
sent
down
from
kiôto
by
the
tycoon
prime
minister
itakura
iga
no
kami
to
hoodwink
us
if
they
had
told
us
the
truth
in
the
beginning
we
would
have
complied
with
their
wishes
but
that
now
it
was
too
late
to
talk
to
us
of
going
so
far
out
of
our
way
merely
to
oblige
them
we
then
returned
to
the
again
and
tried
to
proceed
with
our
meal
the
three
japanese
were
very
crestfallen
and
became
still
more
so
when
mitford
suddenly
turned
to
koméda
and
said
to
him
in
english
that
if
the
private
secretary
who
had
been
sent
down
from
kiôto
on
this
particular
business
would
address
to
him
a
letter
stating
explicitly
the
reasons
why
they
wished
us
to
change
our
route
we
would
fall
in
with
their
wishes
otherwise
we
would
go
by
otsu
even
if
the
guard
should
refuse
to
accompany
us
after
a
little
demur
they
accepted
his
offer
as
the
easiest
alternative
and
takabataké
went
off
to
prepare
the
letter
we
had
great
difficulty
in
obtaining
a
document
to
our
minds
takabataké
produced
three
drafts
one
after
the
other
which
had
to
be
rejected
because
it
was
alleged
in
them
that
we
were
travelling
without
the
permission
of
the
government
and
the
phraseology
was
so
confused
that
it
became
impossible
to
make
head
or
tail
of
it
at
three
in
the
morning
they
at
last
brought
the
fair
copy
of
what
we
had
insisted
on
being
put
down
in
black
and
white
namely
that
great
complications
had
arisen
at
kiôto
in
the
previous
may
on
account
of
sir
harry
passing
through
otsu
which
was
only
six
miles
from
the
capital
and
begging
mitford
as
a
favour
to
go
by
way
of
uji
great
victory
for
us
and
corresponding
defeat
for
the
japanese
officials
i
had
very
little
sleep
that
night
for
we
were
on
the
move
by
a
quarter
to
seven
we
went
in
palanquins
as
far
as
the
bridge
of
séta
and
embarking
in
a
boat
proceeded
down
the
river
to
as
soon
as
we
were
sighted
by
the
priests
in
charge
they
ran
to
shut
the
gates
in
our
face
so
much
for
hirayama
promise
of
admission
it
was
a
very
hot
day
we
left
the
river
to
ascend
and
descend
a
series
of
little
hills
for
four
miles
and
then
came
out
by
the
river
again
here
we
got
a
scanty
meal
of
rice
and
tea
all
that
was
procurable
in
such
an
spot
then
along
the
path
for
a
mile
or
so
by
the
river
which
roared
over
its
rocky
bed
between
steep
schistose
hills
and
then
climbed
a
very
stiff
ascent
trying
in
the
extreme
under
the
burning
august
sun
at
every
peasant
hut
they
told
us
that
it
was
still
four
miles
to
uji
frequently
we
had
to
stop
and
wash
out
our
mouths
by
some
scanty
stream
trickling
from
the
rock
but
at
last
we
reached
the
summit
and
gained
a
magnificent
view
of
the
great
plain
below
in
the
centre
of
which
lies
the
mysterious
and
jealously
guarded
kiôto
like
a
japanese
mecca
in
which
it
was
death
for
the
heathen
foreigner
to
set
his
foot
to
the
left
lay
fushimi
with
its
network
of
canals
and
rivers
far
away
in
front
the
sacred
top
of
atagoyama
at
four
we
got
to
uji
hot
and
tired
having
trudged
our
weary
way
almost
unceasingly
since
noon
we
rested
for
a
couple
of
hours
at
a
charming
on
the
bank
of
the
river
close
to
the
broken
bridge
at
six
we
embarked
in
a
comfortable
houseboat
and
drifted
rapidly
down
stream
to
fushimi
where
we
got
a
bath
and
dinner
at
the
official
hotel
noguchi
afterwards
told
me
that
he
had
overheard
some
men
there
talking
about
the
advisability
of
murdering
us
however
they
lacked
the
courage
to
carry
out
their
idea
and
we
got
away
safely
at
nine
in
a
large
boat
it
was
too
hot
to
sleep
inside
so
i
lay
all
night
on
the
gangway
which
ran
along
the
gunwale
overhanging
the
water
early
in
the
morning
we
reached
ozaka
washed
our
faces
in
the
stream
dressed
and
betook
ourselves
to
the
temple
we
had
occupied
in
the
spring
sir
harry
turned
up
in
the
afternoon
with
the
news
of
the
murder
of
two
sailors
of
icarus
at
nagasaki
as
they
were
lying
in
a
drunken
sleep
on
the
roadway
in
a
low
quarter
of
the
town
before
this
new
outrage
the
tale
of
our
experiences
paled
altogether
in
interest
chapter
xxi
ozaka
and
tokushima
the
next
few
days
were
occupied
almost
exclusively
with
the
question
of
what
measures
were
to
be
adopted
for
the
detection
and
punishment
of
the
murderers
of
the
icarus
sailors
at
nagasaki
sir
harry
as
was
very
natural
took
up
the
matter
with
great
warmth
and
used
some
extremely
strong
language
to
the
principal
minister
of
the
tycoon
a
yet
not
by
any
means
weak
old
gentleman
named
itakura
iga
no
kami
he
seemed
to
be
old
though
probably
not
over
the
rumour
at
nagasaki
had
been
that
the
perpetrators
were
tosa
men
and
the
suspicion
was
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
a
sailing
vessel
and
a
steamer
belonging
to
tosa
which
were
lying
in
the
harbour
suddenly
left
before
dawn
a
few
hours
after
the
murder
it
was
suggested
that
the
perpetrators
had
escaped
in
the
sailing
vessel
as
she
left
an
hour
and
a
half
before
the
steamer
and
that
they
were
transferred
to
the
latter
somewhere
outside
the
harbour
as
far
as
we
could
judge
the
government
seemed
to
entertain
the
same
suspicions
the
tosa
men
had
always
had
the
reputation
for
being
more
savagely
disposed
than
any
other
japanese
the
government
promised
to
dismiss
the
two
governors
of
nagasaki
and
to
send
a
body
of
men
from
yedo
to
patrol
the
foreign
settlement
at
nagasaki
to
prevent
anything
of
the
kind
recurring
upon
this
sir
harry
accepted
an
invitation
to
see
the
tycoon
who
had
come
down
from
kiôto
to
give
an
audience
to
the
french
minister
roches
about
the
recent
arrest
of
some
native
christians
at
nagasaki
sir
harry
mitford
and
i
went
accordingly
to
the
castle
in
palanquins
as
the
weather
was
very
hot
and
no
good
ponies
could
be
procured
we
were
received
in
the
private
the
tycoon
who
looked
a
little
worn
had
with
him
itakura
and
hirayama
the
latter
was
a
little
old
man
of
rather
low
origin
with
sharp
cunning
features
who
had
lately
been
promoted
we
nicknamed
him
the
fox
and
he
deserved
it
well
after
an
hour
talk
on
indifferent
matters
we
were
joined
by
admiral
keppel
and
his
staff
this
led
to
some
conversation
on
naval
affairs
but
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
his
highness
took
very
little
interest
in
the
subject
after
a
while
the
tycoon
sent
for
matsudaira
kansô
the
of
hizen
an
man
of
and
introduced
him
to
sir
harry
and
the
admiral
he
had
a
sharp
countenance
and
spoke
in
a
fitful
abrupt
manner
constantly
winking
with
both
eyes
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
and
a
great
intriguer
and
certainly
up
to
the
very
moment
of
the
revolution
which
took
place
in
he
never
allowed
anyone
to
guess
what
side
he
would
take
he
sat
next
to
the
tycoon
on
his
left
and
the
only
other
mark
of
respect
other
than
that
due
to
equals
which
he
employed
in
speaking
was
the
word
kami
for
you
sir
harry
endeavoured
to
get
an
invitation
out
of
him
to
visit
his
place
at
saga
but
he
was
too
wary
and
merely
expressed
the
expectation
that
they
might
meet
some
day
at
nagasaki
but
that
never
came
to
pass
when
the
tycoon
was
tired
of
talking
we
adjourned
to
the
next
room
where
a
japanese
luncheon
was
served
with
cold
which
was
a
sign
that
no
one
was
expected
to
take
more
than
enough
early
that
morning
i
had
received
a
call
from
saigô
kichinosuké
and
here
i
insert
a
translation
of
a
letter
which
he
afterwards
wrote
to
okubo
ichizô
giving
an
account
of
our
conversation
the
original
was
found
many
years
afterwards
among
the
papers
of
iwakura
jijiû
and
a
copy
was
given
to
me
in
as
i
was
passing
through
tôkiô
on
my
way
home
from
peking
by
my
old
friend
matsugata
masayoshi
copy
of
letter
addressed
by
saigô
takamori
to
okubo
toshimichi
yesterday
morning
at
i
arrived
at
ozaka
and
on
inquiring
where
was
the
lodging
of
the
english
i
learnt
that
it
was
at
the
temple
where
they
were
in
the
spring
so
i
at
once
sent
to
satow
to
inquire
at
what
time
it
would
be
convenient
for
me
to
call
the
answer
was
that
i
should
come
at
i
went
at
that
hour
and
found
he
had
just
woke
and
i
was
shown
upstairs
i
said
that
hearing
of
the
minister
arrival
at
ozaka
i
had
been
as
you
know
sent
as
a
special
messenger
to
inquire
after
his
health
the
ordinary
compliments
having
been
offered
he
said
the
mail
to
england
was
being
despatched
about
ten
and
that
at
eleven
the
minister
was
going
to
the
castle
i
said
that
i
had
no
particular
business
but
had
only
come
to
call
in
order
to
congratulate
him
on
his
arrival
at
ozaka
as
he
must
be
very
busy
i
would
not
trouble
him
with
a
personal
interview
and
begged
him
to
say
so
to
the
minister
he
replied
that
the
minister
particularly
wished
to
meet
me
but
as
he
was
so
much
occupied
he
would
ask
to
be
excused
that
day
he
said
the
minister
would
remain
two
or
three
days
at
ozaka
and
particularly
desired
to
meet
me
and
he
thought
he
would
be
able
to
give
me
an
interview
in
two
or
three
days
he
said
he
would
sail
from
here
on
the
of
next
month
in
order
to
return
to
yokohama
or
probably
yedo
when
i
saw
satow
he
said
things
were
exactly
as
before
and
that
there
had
been
no
change
of
any
importance
and
the
position
being
just
as
before
it
was
entirely
different
from
what
shibayama
had
suspected
therefore
i
told
him
that
the
ozaka
commercial
has
as
i
said
to
you
the
other
day
agreed
with
the
french
and
is
planning
to
make
great
profits
an
obscure
passage
follows
i
said
i
should
like
to
try
to
discuss
the
settlement
of
japanese
affairs
by
the
french
on
which
satow
replied
that
he
would
very
much
like
to
argue
it
i
told
him
the
french
said
japan
must
have
a
single
concentrated
government
like
all
western
countries
and
the
must
be
deprived
of
their
power
above
all
it
was
desirable
to
destroy
the
two
provinces
of
chôshiû
and
satsuma
and
that
it
would
be
well
to
join
in
subduing
them
i
asked
what
he
thought
of
this
satow
then
answered
that
it
might
be
seen
from
the
two
previous
attempts
at
subjugation
that
a
government
which
had
not
been
able
to
beat
chôshiû
alone
would
certainly
not
be
able
to
deprive
all
the
of
their
powers
i
said
how
could
such
weak
people
be
helped
he
replied
that
not
a
word
could
be
said
to
that
and
the
argument
was
impossible
if
such
an
argument
were
publicly
brought
forward
there
was
no
doubt
that
they
would
help
the
government
to
destroy
the
it
was
heard
that
the
idea
was
that
in
two
or
three
years
time
money
would
be
collected
machinery
be
provided
french
assistance
be
invoked
and
war
be
begun
as
the
french
would
then
send
troops
to
give
assistance
it
would
be
dangerous
unless
an
opposite
great
power
were
got
to
assist
if
a
report
were
then
spread
that
england
would
also
send
out
troops
to
protect
it
would
be
impossible
for
french
auxiliary
troops
to
be
set
in
motion
he
said
that
therefore
it
was
necessary
to
come
to
a
thorough
agreement
beforehand
in
the
first
place
the
english
idea
was
that
the
sovereign
of
japan
should
wield
the
governing
power
and
under
him
the
should
be
placed
and
so
the
establishment
of
the
constitution
or
national
polity
would
be
similar
to
the
system
of
all
other
countries
this
was
the
first
word
omitted
here
thing
of
all
the
sovereign
of
england
had
lately
sent
to
the
a
letter
addressed
to
the
sovereign
of
japan
this
was
a
letter
of
condolence
on
hearing
of
the
death
of
the
late
emperor
this
was
to
be
delivered
to
the
emperor
by
the
it
would
be
improper
if
no
reply
were
made
to
it
but
up
to
the
present
no
reply
had
been
received
although
that
was
what
they
had
declared
with
respect
to
the
emperor
of
japan
at
kiôto
did
not
take
that
view
at
all
it
was
maintained
that
the
admission
of
aliens
into
the
capital
would
be
a
defilement
as
that
sort
of
thing
was
undesirable
it
would
be
necessary
that
a
definite
form
of
government
all
countries
carried
on
ordinary
relations
if
it
was
desired
to
consult
with
england
he
would
like
to
be
informed
and
as
he
was
disposed
to
undertake
the
assistance
asked
for
i
replied
that
we
would
exert
ourselves
for
the
transformation
of
the
japanese
government
and
we
had
no
justification
foreigners
the
french
grabbed
profit
at
yokohama
and
entered
into
agreements
for
their
own
pleasure
england
was
a
country
based
on
commerce
and
would
strenuously
oppose
any
attempt
to
hinder
commerce
and
was
therefore
extremely
indignant
the
culprits
who
had
killed
two
english
sailors
at
nagasaki
were
not
yet
known
we
had
heard
it
was
rumoured
to
be
the
act
of
nagasaki
men
he
heard
that
nagasaki
was
very
badly
spoken
of
when
satow
and
others
travelled
overland
from
echizen
nagasaki
men
lay
in
wait
for
them
at
fushimi
it
was
also
said
by
many
that
they
committed
acts
of
violence
at
kiôto
and
gathered
gamblers
together
if
it
was
nagasaki
men
who
had
killed
aliens
at
nagasaki
it
was
to
be
much
regretted
as
doing
a
great
injury
substituted
by
saigô
for
tosa
when
they
came
to
echizen
no
one
came
to
meet
them
though
local
governors
came
to
meet
them
in
the
country
no
one
came
to
see
them
at
the
but
they
were
entertained
hospitably
with
and
satow
said
he
could
not
understand
this
the
above
is
a
summary
of
the
important
points
satow
says
he
will
come
here
at
ten
and
i
think
there
will
be
more
conversation
i
propose
to
stay
two
or
three
days
longer
so
please
understand
that
satow
language
about
the
is
very
insulting
i
will
tell
you
all
in
detail
of
moon
saigo
kichinosuke
okubo
ichizô
sama
note
by
this
copy
of
the
letter
contains
obscurities
and
some
incorrect
transcriptions
next
day
i
went
to
see
saigô
at
the
satsuma
agency
in
order
to
learn
from
him
how
things
were
going
on
at
kiôto
he
talked
a
good
deal
of
a
parliament
of
the
whole
nation
to
be
established
as
a
substitute
for
the
existing
government
of
the
tycoon
which
i
found
from
my
young
friend
matsuné
was
a
very
general
idea
among
the
party
to
me
it
seemed
a
mad
idea
saigô
also
revealed
to
me
a
plan
conceived
by
the
government
for
monopolizing
all
the
trade
of
ozaka
and
hiôgo
by
placing
it
in
the
hands
of
a
guild
of
twenty
rich
native
merchants
which
was
no
doubt
copied
from
the
old
arrangement
at
canton
before
the
opium
war
of
this
piece
of
news
when
it
was
brought
to
him
inflamed
the
wrath
who
immediately
got
hold
of
the
prime
minister
and
insisted
upon
the
scheme
being
abandoned
a
new
proclamation
was
issued
annulling
the
previous
one
establishing
the
guild
but
as
it
was
extorted
by
dint
of
great
diplomatic
pressure
i
had
very
little
belief
in
its
being
acted
on
it
was
and
always
has
been
a
japanese
idea
to
regulate
commerce
both
domestic
and
foreign
by
means
of
the
guilds
who
pay
for
their
monopoly
and
make
the
most
of
it
whatever
may
be
the
abstract
merits
of
such
a
system
it
is
not
altogether
in
accordance
with
western
ideas
and
we
have
never
ceased
to
make
war
upon
it
whenever
it
crossed
our
path
in
eastern
countries
another
matter
about
which
we
had
to
speak
very
strongly
was
the
wording
of
the
tycoon
reply
to
the
queen
letter
conveying
the
usual
expressions
of
condolence
on
the
death
of
the
late
mikado
the
ministers
apologized
very
humbly
for
having
made
use
of
discourteous
forms
and
promised
to
take
great
care
for
the
future
the
style
of
official
documents
addressed
to
the
british
minister
was
also
a
subject
upon
which
we
had
disputes
with
the
japanese
officials
and
it
was
only
after
the
revolution
that
i
succeeded
in
getting
these
things
done
in
proper
form
their
object
was
always
by
the
use
of
particular
forms
and
turns
of
phraseology
to
convey
to
their
own
people
the
belief
that
the
foreign
representatives
were
the
inferiors
of
the
ministers
doubtless
they
did
not
in
their
own
country
hold
a
rank
at
all
approaching
that
of
the
high
functionaries
they
had
to
deal
with
most
of
whom
were
and
it
was
a
difficult
matter
as
it
always
has
been
in
every
eastern
country
to
induce
them
to
recognize
the
official
position
of
a
diplomatist
representing
his
sovereign
i
have
said
in
an
earlier
chapter
that
one
of
my
teachers
at
yokohama
had
been
a
retainer
of
the
of
awa
during
the
spring
when
we
were
first
at
ozaka
there
had
been
some
talk
about
my
going
to
pay
the
a
visit
at
his
capital
which
lay
not
far
from
that
city
but
owing
to
a
misunderstanding
it
came
to
nothing
on
the
present
occasion
the
awa
people
had
sought
me
out
again
and
renewed
the
invitation
which
i
however
persuaded
them
to
transfer
to
sir
harry
and
the
admiral
it
had
been
already
agreed
that
the
british
legation
should
proceed
to
the
province
of
tosa
in
company
with
some
special
commissioners
of
the
tycoon
in
order
to
discover
if
possible
the
murderers
of
the
two
sailors
belonging
to
icarus
our
wily
old
friend
hirayama
was
selected
along
with
a
couple
of
other
officials
for
this
business
and
they
wished
to
precede
us
by
a
few
days
in
order
to
make
a
preliminary
inquiry
so
when
the
projected
visit
to
awa
came
to
the
ears
of
the
ministers
they
pressed
sir
harry
to
accept
it
as
tokushima
lay
in
the
direct
route
to
tosa
and
also
because
they
believed
that
the
was
not
a
dangerous
opponent
but
rather
inclined
to
be
a
partisan
of
the
tycoon
if
he
took
any
side
at
all
sir
harry
was
pleased
because
he
liked
these
entertainments
and
so
the
matter
was
settled
to
every
one
satisfaction
i
took
care
to
keep
to
myself
the
fact
that
the
invitation
had
really
been
intended
for
myself
alone
the
having
heard
about
me
from
my
teacher
and
being
curious
to
see
the
writer
of
the
pamphlet
on
english
policy
sir
harry
and
mitford
went
off
in
the
basilisk
with
hewett
the
salamis
remaining
behind
to
pick
me
up
on
the
following
morning
she
was
to
leave
at
eleven
so
i
had
to
pack
up
overnight
and
start
very
early
i
hurried
off
with
the
legation
writer
ono
leaving
noguchi
in
charge
of
the
baggage
and
as
usual
he
was
late
i
waited
some
time
but
still
he
delayed
i
became
impatient
and
desperately
started
in
a
boat
with
only
the
writer
just
as
we
were
passing
the
proposed
site
of
the
foreign
settlement
noguchi
came
alongside
in
a
tiny
skiff
without
the
baggage
further
down
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
we
changed
into
a
larger
boat
built
to
cross
the
bar
and
got
on
board
late
two
awa
officials
had
joined
just
before
me
and
to
my
great
joy
and
relief
the
baggage
boat
came
alongside
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
we
weighed
anchor
precisely
at
noon
and
steaming
southward
through
the
yura
straits
got
to
the
little
harbour
of
nei
in
awa
about
six
in
the
evening
the
basilisk
was
there
already
apparently
no
one
awaited
our
arrival
sir
harry
therefore
despatched
me
to
tokushima
to
find
out
what
sort
of
reception
he
might
expect
i
got
into
a
big
native
sailing
boat
with
one
of
the
awa
officials
while
the
other
man
hastened
on
ahead
in
another
there
was
a
fresh
breeze
and
we
rushed
along
under
the
cliffs
at
a
good
pace
until
we
found
ourselves
approaching
the
bar
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
on
which
tokushima
is
situated
it
was
already
dark
and
the
breakers
extended
right
across
the
entrance
the
other
boat
which
had
preceded
me
now
turned
back
and
as
she
passed
the
people
on
board
shouted
out
that
the
passage
was
no
longer
safe
my
pilot
however
disregarded
the
warning
and
pushed
boldly
on
the
passage
was
extremely
narrow
between
widely
extended
sandbanks
on
either
side
the
huge
waves
tossed
about
the
boat
big
as
it
was
like
a
child
toy
at
last
after
some
anxious
minutes
we
got
inside
and
were
now
in
comparatively
smooth
water
without
having
shipped
a
drop
a
great
deal
of
apparently
unmeaning
shouting
and
hallooing
took
place
and
our
boat
was
allowed
to
surge
hither
and
thither
till
we
drifted
back
again
to
the
sandbank
where
we
found
the
other
japanese
they
had
run
their
boat
ashore
in
the
most
reckless
way
narrowly
escaping
a
drowning
in
the
surf
after
mutual
congratulations
we
got
into
a
houseboat
and
proceeded
up
the
river
to
the
where
i
had
to
wait
some
time
till
a
guard
of
soldiers
could
be
brought
down
this
gave
time
for
a
crowd
of
spectators
to
collect
in
spite
of
the
advanced
hour
at
last
the
guard
arrived
it
consisted
of
cavalry
in
long
boots
and
conical
hats
with
white
plumes
of
horsehair
commanded
by
a
grizzled
old
warrior
named
hachisuka
mimasaka
a
descendant
of
the
robber
chieftain
who
founded
the
house
of
awa
but
a
retainer
for
all
that
they
escorted
me
in
solemn
procession
to
a
temple
that
had
been
prepared
for
our
accommodation
by
laying
down
red
felt
carpets
and
furnishing
it
with
hastily
constructed
tables
chairs
and
bedsteads
it
was
evident
that
they
had
expected
only
a
small
party
of
three
or
four
europeans
but
i
explained
to
them
that
sir
harry
would
not
land
without
the
admiral
and
neither
of
them
could
come
on
shore
without
the
whole
of
his
staff
so
they
had
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
greatly
extend
their
preparations
before
i
would
acknowledge
myself
satisfied
they
had
written
up
our
official
titles
over
the
doors
of
the
rooms
intended
for
us
and
mine
had
been
rendered
by
a
euphemism
for
interpreter
this
i
immediately
had
done
away
with
and
my
name
substituted
for
in
japan
the
office
of
interpreter
at
that
time
was
looked
upon
as
only
fit
for
the
lowest
class
of
domestic
servants
and
no
one
of
rank
would
ever
condescend
to
speak
a
foreign
language
i
had
often
to
fight
pretty
hard
with
japanese
of
rank
in
order
to
ensure
being
treated
as
something
better
than
a
valet
or
an
orderly
my
good
awa
friends
anxious
to
make
me
as
happy
as
possible
had
racked
their
brains
in
order
to
produce
a
dinner
in
european
style
and
a
most
dismal
banquet
it
was
uneatable
fishes
in
unsightly
dishes
piles
of
unripe
grapes
and
melons
heavy
and
tasteless
sponge
cakes
with
coarse
knives
and
forks
to
eat
with
a
wretched
being
who
had
been
to
the
united
states
as
a
sailor
and
had
picked
up
a
few
words
of
low
english
was
put
forward
prominently
to
wait
upon
me
as
if
i
were
so
ignorant
of
japanese
as
to
need
an
interpreter
it
was
explained
that
he
was
the
only
person
in
the
clan
who
understood
european
manners
and
customs
i
found
him
disgustingly
familiar
and
had
to
address
a
private
remonstrance
to
one
of
the
officials
who
had
come
down
with
me
who
said
that
he
was
a
privileged
person
on
account
of
his
great
learning
nevertheless
he
administered
a
rebuke
to
the
individual
in
question
who
thereupon
reverted
to
his
native
japanese
good
manners
i
had
entirely
lost
my
appetite
owing
to
having
been
without
food
since
the
middle
of
the
day
we
proceeded
to
discuss
various
points
of
etiquette
connected
with
our
proposed
visit
to
the
at
his
castle
it
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
foreigners
of
rank
had
been
received
within
the
walls
of
a
native
baron
fortress
it
was
finally
decided
that
we
should
ride
past
the
place
where
the
notice
to
dismount
stands
and
get
off
our
horses
at
the
inner
gate
the
question
of
precedence
at
table
was
also
decided
on
one
side
were
to
sit
the
his
eldest
son
and
a
named
mori
commander
suttie
of
the
salamis
major
crossman
of
the
royal
engineers
lieutenant
stephenson
flag
lieutenant
on
the
other
sir
harry
parkes
admiral
sir
harry
keppel
captain
hewett
mitford
and
risk
the
secretary
i
was
to
sit
at
the
head
of
the
table
between
sir
harry
and
the
separate
and
special
individual
presents
were
to
be
given
to
sir
harry
parkes
to
the
admiral
and
to
myself
and
a
general
present
to
all
the
others
to
be
divided
among
them
as
they
liked
after
all
these
knotty
points
had
been
disposed
of
at
a
late
hour
i
got
to
bed
on
the
following
morning
i
left
early
and
went
down
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
to
see
whether
it
was
possible
to
cross
the
bar
in
order
to
meet
sir
harry
but
found
that
it
was
still
impassable
owing
to
the
heavy
swell
that
continued
to
roll
in
from
the
open
sea
after
wasting
a
good
deal
of
time
in
this
vain
attempt
i
returned
to
the
town
and
procured
nine
horses
with
which
i
started
off
overland
to
nei
where
the
ships
were
lying
the
road
was
pretty
good
in
places
but
at
times
very
narrow
and
wound
in
and
out
among
the
hills
the
ponies
were
sturdy
little
animals
and
though
unshod
trotted
over
the
stones
without
stumbling
but
they
had
hard
mouths
and
would
not
obey
the
snaffle
at
nei
i
got
a
small
boat
and
went
on
board
from
sir
harry
downwards
everyone
was
willing
to
risk
the
ride
to
tokushima
in
spite
of
the
weather
we
started
at
four
and
in
a
couple
of
hours
reached
the
town
in
a
heavy
storm
of
rain
and
wind
the
streams
which
had
been
quite
dry
when
i
passed
in
the
middle
of
the
day
were
now
so
swollen
that
the
water
came
up
to
the
ponies
girths
we
were
wet
through
if
we
changed
at
the
temple
there
was
the
risk
of
getting
wet
again
in
riding
to
the
castle
it
was
arranged
therefore
that
we
should
go
on
as
we
were
and
dress
in
an
mitford
and
aston
were
engaged
in
drying
their
clothes
i
had
got
into
a
pair
of
pyjamas
and
could
not
ride
in
that
costume
so
i
tried
to
procure
three
palanquins
for
us
which
took
an
unexpectedly
long
time
to
produce
sir
harry
lost
his
temper
and
swore
he
would
not
be
kept
waiting
for
all
the
d
d
in
japan
numata
my
old
teacher
and
the
other
awa
people
manifested
the
most
stoical
indifference
to
all
this
wrath
mitford
volunteered
to
go
on
horseback
so
they
set
out
aston
as
a
punishment
for
not
being
ready
was
forbidden
by
sir
harry
to
join
the
party
a
prohibition
which
caused
him
the
intensest
joy
at
last
my
palanquin
arrived
i
got
in
and
the
bearers
went
off
at
such
a
pace
that
i
reached
the
castle
at
the
same
moment
as
the
others
in
the
dark
for
it
was
now
nine
or
ten
the
walls
of
cyclopean
masonry
as
we
entered
the
gates
and
wound
through
the
outer
fortifications
seemed
very
imposing
though
they
were
not
so
in
reality
we
had
to
alight
outside
the
point
at
which
i
had
agreed
with
the
officials
but
luckily
no
one
seemed
to
be
aware
of
the
alteration
we
got
into
the
palace
and
were
shown
into
rooms
where
we
changed
our
dress
and
the
different
garb
worn
by
the
various
members
of
the
party
was
very
curious
no
proper
uniforms
or
evening
dress
at
all
i
could
only
muster
a
shirt
a
white
coat
and
trousers
no
waistcoat
and
no
cummerbund
sir
harry
was
the
only
one
who
kept
his
shoes
on
as
every
one
had
got
his
feet
wet
in
riding
from
nei
everyone
being
at
last
ready
we
were
ushered
through
a
series
of
wide
passages
into
the
banqueting
room
and
were
met
by
the
prince
who
according
to
the
agreement
was
clad
in
the
ordinary
costume
of
a
gentleman
wide
trousers
gown
and
mantle
of
silk
the
introductions
followed
in
the
proper
order
of
rank
and
the
prince
led
the
way
to
the
tables
the
top
one
was
oval
having
been
made
months
ago
when
it
was
expected
that
mitford
and
i
would
be
the
only
guests
the
others
were
square
for
the
prince
and
his
son
there
were
elaborately
carved
chairs
of
style
for
the
rest
of
us
there
were
chairs
with
seats
very
rickety
and
badly
balanced
we
were
placed
with
our
backs
to
the
alcove
this
being
the
seat
of
honour
on
which
the
presents
were
laid
out
a
magnificent
bronze
about
two
feet
high
occupying
the
centre
sir
harry
and
the
admiral
gave
the
prince
a
couple
of
revolvers
which
seemed
to
afford
him
much
pleasure
and
the
return
presents
consisting
of
rolls
of
brocade
crape
and
so
forth
were
then
announced
by
one
of
the
attendants
sir
harry
who
had
by
this
time
quite
recovered
his
equanimity
made
himself
very
agreeable
to
the
prince
talking
on
general
topics
instead
of
dwelling
on
the
relations
of
friendship
which
happily
unite
our
respective
countries
and
the
usual
diplomatic
commonplaces
the
prince
awa
no
kami
to
give
him
his
proper
title
was
a
man
of
about
years
of
age
of
middle
height
and
with
a
refined
countenance
slightly
his
manner
abrupt
and
imperious
but
his
good
humour
without
limits
awaji
no
kami
the
son
was
about
a
little
taller
than
his
father
with
a
mild
fat
countenance
a
gentle
and
subdued
manner
and
he
exhibited
great
deference
towards
his
father
the
usual
order
of
a
japanese
dinner
was
reversed
the
rice
soup
and
baked
fish
being
first
placed
on
the
table
when
this
course
had
been
removed
drinking
commenced
a
red
lacquer
cup
being
handed
first
to
sir
harry
i
whispered
to
sir
harry
to
call
for
the
bowl
to
dip
it
in
and
he
returned
it
to
the
prince
who
then
offered
it
to
the
admiral
and
to
captain
hewett
and
then
it
travelled
down
the
line
to
stephenson
from
whom
it
was
returned
to
the
prince
there
was
a
good
deal
of
picking
at
the
various
dishes
of
the
banquet
which
was
placed
before
us
and
a
great
quantity
of
was
drunk
after
a
while
a
play
was
announced
and
in
order
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
acting
we
moved
our
chairs
down
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
tables
with
our
plates
and
drinking
cups
were
placed
before
us
the
actors
were
retainers
of
the
prince
wearing
the
long
trousers
belonging
to
the
court
costume
but
not
otherwise
dressed
for
their
parts
in
the
first
piece
there
was
three
characters
master
servant
and
guest
the
master
tells
the
servant
to
imitate
him
in
all
things
which
injunction
he
takes
literally
and
addresses
the
guest
in
exactly
the
same
style
as
his
master
employs
to
him
this
enrages
the
master
who
cuffs
the
servant
and
he
in
turn
the
guest
this
sort
of
fun
continues
with
variations
until
the
patience
is
quite
exhausted
and
he
kicks
the
servant
out
of
the
room
the
second
piece
is
a
one
entitled
the
three
cripples
a
rich
and
benevolent
person
advertises
for
cripples
to
enter
his
employ
and
there
enter
successively
a
lame
a
blind
and
a
dumb
man
gamblers
who
having
become
beggars
have
adopted
these
disguises
in
order
to
impose
on
the
charitable
they
are
accepted
and
having
placed
them
in
charge
of
three
their
employer
goes
out
then
the
three
recognize
each
other
as
old
comrades
and
agree
to
open
one
of
the
which
is
full
of
after
which
they
will
rob
the
other
two
however
they
get
so
drunk
that
when
their
master
returns
each
forgets
the
part
he
had
previously
played
the
blind
man
assumes
dumbness
the
lame
one
blindness
and
the
dumb
pretends
to
be
deaf
their
detection
of
course
follows
with
the
natural
consequences
after
the
play
was
over
we
drew
round
the
little
tables
and
the
cup
passed
freely
from
hand
to
hand
awa
no
kami
vowed
that
the
admiral
was
his
father
and
sir
harry
his
elder
brother
while
awaji
no
kami
expressed
himself
to
me
in
a
similarly
affectionate
manner
it
was
arranged
that
we
should
have
a
review
of
the
troops
on
the
following
day
and
about
midnight
the
wind
and
rain
having
moderated
we
took
our
leave
getting
back
to
our
lodging
at
one
in
the
morning
i
found
that
even
our
servants
had
not
been
forgotten
presents
having
been
sent
to
each
one
of
them
not
a
single
person
was
passed
over
this
was
truly
princely
hospitality
i
forgot
to
mention
that
before
we
started
for
the
castle
a
polite
message
of
welcome
was
brought
to
sir
harry
from
the
prince
accompanied
by
a
box
three
feet
long
one
deep
and
one
wide
full
of
eggs
another
of
the
same
size
full
of
vermicelli
and
a
basket
of
fish
the
trouble
that
had
been
taken
to
make
us
comfortable
was
very
great
even
after
they
had
heard
of
the
increased
number
they
would
have
to
entertain
they
had
gone
to
work
to
make
bedsteads
and
tables
and
even
to
build
bathrooms
the
morning
turned
out
finer
than
could
have
been
reasonably
hoped
for
after
the
storm
of
the
preceding
day
and
after
breakfast
we
started
for
the
parade
ground
our
way
lay
through
the
castle
and
over
a
considerable
stream
which
washed
one
side
of
the
fortress
it
was
a
very
good
ground
though
rather
small
but
the
prince
explained
that
he
could
not
enlarge
it
without
pulling
down
some
buddhist
temples
which
would
shock
the
religious
feeling
of
the
townspeople
some
five
hundred
men
divided
into
five
bodies
of
varying
strength
were
put
through
their
drill
their
uniform
was
in
imitation
of
european
style
black
trousers
with
red
stripes
down
the
side
and
black
coats
happy
the
soldier
who
could
muster
a
pair
of
boots
the
rest
had
only
straw
sandals
on
their
heads
they
had
hats
of
either
conical
or
of
shape
with
two
horizontal
red
bands
they
used
the
english
infantry
drill
with
the
quaint
addition
of
a
shout
to
indicate
the
discharge
of
their
firearms
in
the
opinion
of
those
who
were
competent
to
judge
they
acquitted
themselves
very
creditably
we
viewed
the
evolutions
from
a
sort
of
grand
stand
with
tables
before
us
piled
up
with
various
delicacies
of
course
formed
part
of
the
entertainment
and
hewett
was
singled
out
by
the
prince
as
assuredly
the
best
toper
of
us
all
on
account
of
his
jolly
red
face
everyone
this
morning
had
remarked
what
a
capital
liquor
is
it
leaves
no
bad
effects
behind
from
which
it
may
be
inferred
that
we
had
returned
home
on
the
previous
night
in
a
happy
frame
of
mind
and
body
about
noon
we
took
our
leave
sir
harry
presented
a
ring
to
the
young
prince
and
the
admiral
put
another
on
the
finger
of
awa
no
kami
to
their
intense
delight
on
our
way
back
from
the
drill
ground
we
were
taken
to
a
temple
on
a
hill
commanding
an
extensive
view
where
we
were
entertained
with
a
luncheon
washed
down
with
bad
champagne
procured
in
yokohama
for
the
occasion
the
prince
whispered
privately
into
my
ear
that
he
intended
to
abdicate
and
pay
a
visit
to
england
to
sir
harry
he
said
all
sorts
of
friendly
things
about
the
opening
of
hiôgo
to
foreign
trade
the
admiral
promised
to
bring
the
ocean
and
rodney
to
nei
in
the
coming
winter
to
show
him
what
english
were
like
after
returning
to
our
lodgings
we
had
a
substantial
lunch
off
the
provisions
brought
from
the
ships
but
our
entertainers
were
not
contented
till
they
had
made
us
sit
down
to
a
final
feast
prepared
by
themselves
just
for
five
minutes
to
drink
a
farewell
cup
and
receive
a
parting
message
from
the
prince
at
last
we
got
away
some
on
horseback
others
in
palanquins
and
in
three
hours
after
leaving
tokushima
we
were
safely
on
board
ship
sir
harry
was
accompanied
by
four
principal
officials
to
the
basilisk
where
hewett
gave
them
some
excellent
champagne
and
they
went
over
the
ship
side
full
of
affectionate
regrets
at
having
to
part
from
us
the
salamis
left
at
once
for
yokohama
with
the
admiral
mitford
aston
and
crossman
while
we
remained
to
pursue
our
voyage
to
tosa
on
the
morrow
in
the
basilisk
chapter
xxii
tosa
and
nagasaki
early
on
the
morning
of
september
we
anchored
outside
the
little
harbour
of
susaki
in
tosa
inside
were
lying
the
tycoon
war
steamer
eagle
kaiten
maru
and
a
smaller
one
belonging
to
the
prince
of
tosa
we
had
fully
expected
a
hostile
reception
and
preparations
had
been
made
for
action
shortly
afterwards
takabataké
gorô
and
koméda
keijirô
came
on
board
to
say
that
hirayama
the
chief
commissioner
was
up
at
kôchi
gotô
shôjirô
the
leading
tosa
minister
also
paid
us
a
visit
but
we
told
him
to
go
away
till
we
could
get
the
ship
inside
the
bay
then
arrived
the
other
two
commissioners
togawa
and
an
ômetsuké
to
tell
us
that
no
evidence
implicating
any
of
the
tosa
men
had
been
discovered
the
little
schooner
nankai
in
which
the
assassins
were
supposed
to
have
escaped
from
nagasaki
was
lying
higher
up
the
bay
at
urado
later
on
gotô
came
on
board
with
two
other
local
officers
they
promised
to
do
all
they
could
to
discover
the
murderers
even
if
they
should
not
be
tosa
men
sir
harry
who
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
that
the
tosa
men
were
guilty
tried
to
browbeat
them
adding
oddly
enough
that
with
tosa
he
could
have
none
but
friendly
relations
the
official
discussions
must
take
place
with
the
tycoon
government
after
they
left
hirayama
made
his
appearance
a
long
and
stormy
interview
took
place
in
the
course
of
which
he
heard
a
good
deal
of
strong
language
and
was
told
that
he
was
of
no
more
use
than
a
common
messenger
he
recounted
to
us
in
a
plaintive
manner
the
hardships
he
had
undergone
on
the
way
down
and
since
his
arrival
for
the
tosa
people
were
extremely
angry
at
the
suspicions
cast
on
them
later
on
sir
harry
sent
me
ashore
to
see
gotô
and
detail
to
him
all
the
circumstances
which
seemed
to
us
to
be
evidence
against
his
fellow
clansmen
he
renewed
the
assurances
he
had
given
in
the
morning
and
said
he
felt
certain
my
writer
ono
and
noguchi
were
neither
more
nor
less
than
government
spies
the
next
morning
i
saw
gotô
again
who
renewed
his
protestations
and
complained
of
sir
harry
rough
language
and
demeanour
which
he
felt
sure
would
some
day
cause
a
terrible
row
i
was
myself
rather
sick
of
being
made
the
intermediary
of
the
overbearing
language
to
which
the
chief
habitually
resorted
and
told
gotô
to
remonstrate
with
him
if
he
really
thought
this
as
for
myself
i
did
not
dare
to
hint
anything
of
the
kind
to
my
chief
i
also
saw
hirayama
and
arranged
with
him
that
i
should
be
present
at
the
examination
of
the
officers
of
the
nankai
who
were
to
be
sent
down
from
urado
at
three
two
small
steamers
arrived
yet
it
was
seven
before
the
officials
reached
the
basilisk
to
say
that
everything
was
in
readiness
as
dinner
was
now
announced
the
inquiry
was
put
off
till
the
next
day
on
the
september
the
examination
was
accordingly
held
in
my
presence
on
the
japanese
side
the
evidence
went
to
show
that
the
nankai
did
not
leave
till
ten
on
the
august
while
sir
harry
version
was
that
she
sailed
at
four
that
morning
only
an
hour
and
a
half
after
the
schooner
and
it
was
on
this
alleged
fact
that
the
whole
of
the
suspicion
against
the
tosa
men
was
founded
it
was
proved
at
the
end
of
that
the
murderers
belonged
to
the
chikuzen
clan
which
was
rather
an
unfortunate
conclusion
for
him
i
reported
this
to
sir
harry
who
was
of
course
greatly
dissatisfied
gotô
afterwards
came
on
board
to
see
sir
harry
and
there
was
the
usual
talk
about
cultivating
friendly
relations
between
the
english
and
tosa
sir
harry
said
he
wished
to
send
me
as
his
envoy
to
call
formally
on
the
retired
of
tosa
to
which
gotô
replied
that
sir
harry
could
himself
see
the
if
we
were
on
friendly
terms
otherwise
it
was
useless
to
hold
any
communications
even
by
messenger
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
i
could
easily
manage
to
visit
kôchi
if
left
to
myself
without
the
chief
taking
a
roundabout
way
to
get
me
there
under
the
pretext
of
a
mission
to
the
old
prince
by
this
time
my
relations
with
the
japanese
were
such
that
i
could
have
gone
anywhere
with
perfect
safety
a
visit
from
hirayama
and
his
colleagues
came
next
the
evidence
taken
was
discussed
and
sir
harry
said
the
inquiry
must
now
be
removed
to
nagasaki
and
that
hirayama
ought
to
proceed
thither
to
conduct
it
hirayama
objected
strongly
offering
to
send
his
two
fellow
commissioners
but
it
would
not
do
and
he
was
finally
forced
to
consent
the
poor
old
fellow
was
almost
at
his
wit
end
he
became
actually
impertinent
and
remarked
that
after
all
this
murder
case
concerned
englishmen
alone
while
he
had
business
to
transact
at
yedo
which
concerned
all
nations
i
was
much
astonished
to
find
that
sir
harry
did
not
get
into
a
passion
on
being
talked
to
in
this
somewhat
unceremonious
way
by
a
japanese
but
simply
replied
to
it
in
a
quiet
argumentative
tone
but
a
more
curious
thing
followed
after
dinner
gotô
came
on
board
to
have
a
talk
on
politics
he
spoke
of
his
idea
of
establishing
a
parliament
and
a
constitution
on
the
english
model
and
said
that
saigô
entertained
similar
notions
that
we
had
learnt
at
ozaka
then
followed
a
good
deal
of
abuse
of
the
government
especially
with
reference
to
the
proposed
formation
of
a
guild
to
control
the
foreign
commerce
of
ozaka
and
hiôgo
we
showed
him
the
proclamation
we
had
extorted
from
the
government
intended
to
annul
the
previous
one
constituting
these
guilds
he
replied
that
it
was
a
mere
blind
and
i
confess
that
i
agreed
with
him
sir
harry
took
a
great
fancy
to
him
as
being
one
of
the
most
intelligent
japanese
we
had
as
yet
met
with
and
to
my
own
mind
saigô
alone
was
his
superior
by
force
of
character
they
swore
eternal
friendship
and
gotô
promised
to
write
once
a
month
to
report
anything
that
might
come
to
light
in
connection
with
the
icarus
murder
last
of
all
he
remonstrated
with
sir
harry
at
some
length
and
in
very
explicit
terms
about
his
rough
demeanour
on
previous
occasions
and
hinted
that
perhaps
others
would
not
have
submitted
so
quietly
to
such
treatment
it
was
by
no
means
a
pleasant
task
for
me
to
put
his
words
into
english
especially
as
presence
rendered
the
rebuke
all
the
more
galling
and
sir
harry
at
first
seemed
inclined
to
resent
being
thus
lectured
by
a
japanese
however
he
managed
to
keep
his
temper
so
no
bones
were
broken
poor
old
hirayama
was
made
quite
ill
by
the
struggle
he
had
had
with
the
chief
but
he
did
not
venture
to
break
his
promise
to
proceed
to
nagasaki
and
pursue
the
inquiry
in
person
i
now
received
detailed
written
instructions
from
sir
harry
to
follow
the
old
fox
as
we
called
him
to
nagasaki
to
watch
the
proceedings
and
stimulate
both
the
tycoon
officials
and
the
tosa
people
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
in
their
search
for
the
murderers
sir
harry
himself
was
obliged
to
return
to
yedo
in
the
basilisk
and
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
take
a
passage
down
to
nagasaki
in
a
tosa
steamer
together
with
the
incriminated
officers
of
the
nankai
and
the
officials
named
to
conduct
the
inquiry
i
was
to
be
clothed
with
authority
equal
to
that
of
the
consul
but
was
not
to
interfere
in
any
measures
he
might
think
fit
to
take
sir
harry
left
on
the
september
and
i
transferred
myself
to
the
tosa
steamer
along
with
my
writer
and
the
faithful
noguchi
there
i
spent
the
next
day
after
having
seen
the
tycoon
war
steamer
eagle
depart
with
hirayama
on
board
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
was
woken
up
by
a
messenger
from
gotô
bringing
an
invitation
for
me
to
go
up
to
kôchi
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
they
had
sent
down
a
tugboat
for
me
so
i
went
on
board
at
once
at
four
after
a
hasty
meal
of
rice
and
tea
and
falling
asleep
on
a
locker
woke
up
at
daylight
to
find
myself
already
some
way
from
susaki
we
did
not
anchor
at
urado
till
nine
the
view
outside
of
distant
hills
and
a
belt
of
pine
trees
fringing
the
shore
reminded
me
strongly
of
the
bay
of
point
de
galle
in
ceylon
where
the
eastern
mail
steamers
used
to
call
before
the
construction
of
the
harbour
at
colombo
kôchi
bay
is
in
reality
an
estuary
with
a
very
narrow
outlet
much
obstructed
by
rocks
we
seemed
to
be
running
straight
on
to
the
sandy
beach
when
a
sudden
turn
to
the
left
put
our
head
into
the
river
and
we
came
to
an
anchor
in
fifteen
feet
of
water
inside
a
little
cove
the
river
widens
considerably
above
this
point
but
is
so
shallow
that
only
boats
drawing
less
than
a
foot
of
water
can
go
up
i
was
transferred
to
a
houseboat
which
made
very
slow
progress
at
last
after
traversing
two
or
three
broad
reaches
we
came
in
sight
of
the
castle
of
kôchi
rendered
conspicuous
from
a
distance
by
its
lofty
donjon
four
storeys
high
soon
afterwards
we
turned
up
an
embanked
canal
to
the
left
and
touched
the
shore
under
a
large
new
building
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
here
i
was
met
by
gotô
who
told
me
that
the
would
shortly
arrive
while
waiting
for
his
appearance
i
changed
my
dress
and
was
introduced
to
a
host
of
gotô
colleagues
at
last
the
yôdô
was
announced
and
i
was
conducted
upstairs
into
his
presence
he
met
me
at
the
threshold
and
saluted
me
by
touching
the
tips
of
his
toes
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
i
replied
by
a
bow
of
exactly
equal
profundity
we
then
took
our
seats
he
on
a
handsome
japanese
armchair
with
his
back
to
the
alcove
and
i
on
a
common
wooden
chair
opposite
a
little
lower
down
to
his
right
gotô
and
some
of
his
fellow
councillors
squatted
on
the
sill
dividing
the
room
from
that
next
to
it
he
began
by
saying
that
he
had
heard
my
name
i
replied
by
thanking
him
for
according
me
the
honour
of
this
interview
he
then
renewed
the
assurances
already
given
through
gotô
that
if
the
murderers
were
tosa
men
they
should
be
arrested
and
punished
and
that
even
if
it
should
appear
that
the
guilty
persons
belonged
to
another
clan
he
would
not
relax
his
efforts
to
trace
them
out
he
had
received
a
letter
from
the
tycoon
stating
that
he
had
heard
there
was
strong
evidence
against
tosa
and
advising
him
to
punish
the
offenders
this
of
course
he
would
be
ready
to
do
supposing
that
the
murderers
were
men
of
his
clan
but
he
did
not
understand
what
the
tycoon
meant
by
evidence
i
replied
that
we
supposed
the
government
to
be
in
possession
of
proofs
which
they
had
not
disclosed
as
it
was
not
likely
that
they
were
convinced
simply
by
what
sir
harry
had
said
to
them
perhaps
i
added
they
threw
the
suspicion
on
tosa
in
order
to
get
rid
of
an
unpleasant
discussion
this
remark
called
forth
from
gotô
somewhat
unmeasured
expressions
of
indignation
and
he
announced
his
intention
of
giving
the
government
a
piece
of
his
mind
on
the
subject
old
yôdô
said
that
he
had
received
a
letter
from
a
friend
advising
him
to
try
and
compromise
the
matter
as
the
english
were
greatly
incensed
at
the
murder
of
their
men
but
he
would
do
nothing
of
the
kind
if
his
people
were
guilty
he
would
punish
them
he
could
do
no
more
but
if
they
were
innocent
he
would
declare
their
innocence
through
thick
and
thin
matsuné
dzusho
the
chief
man
of
uwajima
had
told
iyo
no
kami
that
sir
harry
had
said
the
tycoon
government
had
assured
him
of
tosa
guilt
i
replied
again
that
from
the
language
of
the
tycoon
ministers
we
could
not
help
inferring
that
they
had
independent
grounds
for
their
suspicions
yôdô
remarked
that
the
only
thing
hirayama
had
alleged
was
the
supposed
transfer
of
men
from
the
schooner
yokobuyé
to
the
steamer
nankai
which
had
never
been
proved
i
answered
that
this
was
all
we
had
to
go
upon
but
i
should
consider
that
we
had
good
reason
to
blush
if
after
all
we
had
said
the
men
should
turn
out
to
belong
to
another
clan
at
present
i
saw
no
ground
for
supposing
that
we
were
mistaken
an
argument
then
ensued
between
gotô
and
myself
as
to
the
nature
of
suspiciousness
in
general
and
what
might
be
held
to
be
sufficient
justification
for
that
attitude
of
mind
in
the
end
he
admitted
that
we
were
entitled
by
our
past
experience
to
mistrust
all
japanese
though
he
maintained
that
in
the
present
case
the
rule
did
not
apply
after
this
yôdô
and
gotô
plied
me
with
questions
about
the
luxemburg
affair
the
constitution
and
powers
of
parliament
and
the
electoral
system
it
was
evident
that
the
idea
of
a
constitution
resembling
that
of
great
britain
had
already
taken
deep
root
in
their
minds
later
on
a
proposition
was
actually
made
to
either
mitford
or
myself
i
forget
which
to
enter
the
service
of
the
mikado
and
assist
in
organizing
their
parliament
for
them
huge
dishes
of
fish
were
now
placed
on
the
table
and
waiting
women
in
the
exaggerated
style
of
the
courts
poured
out
the
while
we
drank
and
conversed
a
pair
of
anatomical
models
of
the
male
and
female
human
being
life
size
were
exhibited
and
taken
to
pieces
for
my
especial
edification
rice
was
afterwards
served
in
the
next
room
yôdô
excusing
himself
on
the
ground
of
indisposition
the
fact
was
he
preferred
to
remain
alone
with
the
bottle
of
which
he
was
notoriously
fond
i
had
once
in
my
possession
a
scroll
of
chinese
verses
from
his
brush
signed
drunken
old
man
before
taking
my
departure
i
saw
him
once
more
for
a
few
minutes
when
he
presented
me
with
seven
rolls
of
white
crape
under
the
circumstances
i
should
have
preferred
to
decline
them
but
gotô
argued
that
they
were
a
part
of
the
entertainment
and
i
could
not
refuse
without
being
ungracious
almost
discourteous
i
therefore
accepted
subject
to
the
chief
approval
and
we
parted
with
the
same
exchange
of
formal
bows
as
before
yôdô
was
a
tall
man
slightly
with
bad
teeth
and
a
hurried
manner
of
getting
out
his
words
he
certainly
looked
very
ill
and
in
would
quite
account
for
that
from
some
of
the
remarks
he
made
i
gathered
that
he
was
free
from
prejudice
and
not
by
any
means
conservative
in
his
political
notions
still
it
may
be
doubted
whether
he
was
prepared
to
go
the
same
lengths
as
satsuma
and
chôshiû
in
the
direction
of
change
it
was
not
considered
advisable
or
safe
for
me
to
promenade
through
the
town
and
i
made
no
attempt
to
insist
on
doing
the
sights
as
i
returned
back
to
urado
in
the
gondola
multitudes
of
people
followed
in
small
boats
anxious
to
get
a
sight
of
the
first
european
that
had
visited
their
part
of
the
country
since
the
wreck
of
the
spanish
galleon
in
and
even
grappling
with
us
in
order
better
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
no
order
was
kept
and
i
was
easily
convinced
that
a
walk
in
kôchi
itself
might
have
given
rise
to
a
tumult
next
day
they
took
me
to
susaki
and
put
me
on
board
the
shooeyleen
the
steamer
in
which
we
were
to
proceed
to
nagasaki
for
the
past
two
days
i
had
been
suffering
from
a
whitlow
on
one
of
the
fingers
of
the
right
hand
and
felt
utterly
indifferent
to
all
that
passed
around
me
bad
food
a
dirty
cabin
excessive
heat
sullen
were
all
accepted
with
the
calmness
of
exhausted
misery
the
shooeyleen
boilers
were
old
and
we
steamed
along
at
the
rate
of
two
knots
an
hour
luckily
the
weather
was
calm
otherwise
there
was
every
reason
to
think
we
must
have
gone
to
the
bottom
passing
through
shimonoséki
i
went
on
shore
to
ask
after
old
friends
and
found
inouyé
bunda
who
was
a
perfect
sink
of
taciturnity
there
was
no
appearance
here
of
guns
or
nothing
to
indicate
that
chôshiû
was
still
at
war
with
the
tycoon
but
all
around
were
signs
of
peace
and
prosperity
the
tosa
officers
also
landed
one
and
all
on
some
pretext
or
other
and
the
whole
day
was
spent
at
anchor
towards
evening
we
set
forth
again
in
the
same
leisurely
fashion
and
reached
nagasaki
on
the
september
late
in
the
afternoon
here
i
put
up
with
marcus
flowers
the
consul
at
dinner
that
evening
i
met
for
the
first
time
the
kido
junichirô
otherwise
katsura
kogorô
who
came
to
the
consulate
together
with
itô
shunsuké
whom
i
had
known
since
katsura
was
remarkable
for
his
gentle
suave
manner
though
under
this
there
lay
a
character
of
the
greatest
courage
and
determination
both
military
and
political
we
had
some
talk
after
dinner
about
politics
but
i
think
they
mistrusted
me
at
any
rate
they
thought
it
necessary
to
assert
that
their
prince
was
a
much
wronged
innocent
and
harmless
individual
who
had
never
entertained
any
schemes
for
overturning
the
tycoon
government
but
we
had
long
been
in
possession
of
indisputable
evidence
that
the
abolition
of
the
shôgunate
was
the
cardinal
point
in
the
policy
pursued
by
the
western
acting
in
concert
on
the
following
day
flowers
and
i
went
to
meet
hirayama
at
the
the
two
governors
were
also
present
though
they
had
been
severely
blamed
by
sir
harry
they
did
not
appear
to
be
particularly
disturbed
by
his
censures
the
tosa
steamer
nankai
had
left
in
fact
she
steamed
out
of
the
harbour
just
after
sir
harry
went
off
in
the
basilisk
on
the
of
august
as
she
was
about
to
leave
for
kagoshima
she
was
stopped
and
an
examination
was
held
which
lasted
through
the
night
until
the
afternoon
of
the
but
without
any
evidence
of
complicity
in
the
murders
being
elicited
the
officers
and
crew
were
then
entrusted
to
the
charge
of
iwasaki
yatarô
tosa
agent
who
undertook
to
produce
them
whenever
they
should
be
wanted
but
she
sailed
the
same
evening
in
defiance
of
orders
at
least
so
the
tosa
people
alleged
nothing
had
been
discovered
with
respect
to
the
real
criminals
and
as
far
as
we
could
see
the
governors
had
not
exerted
themselves
to
find
out
the
guilty
persons
the
i
spent
with
itô
and
katsura
at
a
called
tamagawa
away
at
the
back
of
the
town
close
to
the
stream
which
flows
down
through
it
we
had
a
long
discussion
on
japanese
politics
domestic
and
foreign
ending
with
the
conclusion
that
europeans
and
japanese
would
never
mix
at
least
not
in
our
time
on
my
way
back
i
called
on
hikozô
the
joseph
heco
who
told
me
of
a
document
said
to
be
signed
by
satsuma
tosa
geishiû
bizen
and
awa
which
had
been
presented
to
the
shôgun
keiki
requiring
him
to
resign
his
office
and
allow
the
government
to
be
reconstituted
on
sunday
the
i
lunched
with
hirayama
he
said
that
sasaki
sanshirô
the
tosa
equivalent
to
but
not
trained
in
law
was
overruled
by
the
tosa
society
called
the
a
sort
of
local
navy
league
who
would
not
allow
him
to
carry
out
the
official
orders
received
from
his
prince
to
have
search
made
for
the
criminals
this
was
natural
enough
as
it
was
afterwards
proved
that
the
tosa
men
were
altogether
innocent
of
the
affair

the
was
spent
at
the
custom
house
in
the
examination
of
the
men
of
the
yokobuyé
a
tosa
it
appeared
certain
that
the
nankai
did
not
leave
nagasaki
till
the
evening
of
the
august
two
of
the
one
of
whom
was
the
captain
of
the
yokobuyé
were
shown
to
have
been
at
a
house
of
entertainment
opposite
to
the
spot
where
the
british
sailors
were
murdered
up
to
midnight
this
looked
suspicious
but
i
told
the
japanese
officials
that
if
they
did
not
disbelieve
the
statements
that
had
been
made
neither
did
i
the
tosa
people
did
not
want
to
make
the
yokobuyé
return
neither
did
the
government
officials
seem
to
insist
on
her
recall
as
my
plan
was
to
throw
on
the
government
officials
the
responsibility
of
discovering
the
murderers
i
did
not
urge
it
but
left
it
to
flowers
who
was
associated
with
me
in
the
inquiry
to
do
so
if
he
judged
it
necessary
in
the
evening
of
the
i
went
to
see
hirayama
and
communicated
to
him
my
suspicions
regarding
a
young
fellow
of
forbidding
countenance
who
was
with
the
captain
of
the
yokobuyé
on
the
night
of
the
murder
at
the
house
of
entertainment
referred
to
i
suggested
that
his
companion
should
be
sent
for
and
also
the
four
men
stated
to
have
gone
to
karatsu
in
the
north
of
hizen
near
the
boundary
of
chikuzen
in
the
nankai
and
to
have
landed
there
i
advised
that
the
keeper
of
the
house
of
entertainment
should
be
examined
and
asked
for
copies
of
all
depositions
received
especially
of
the
two
tosa
men
what
had
fixed
suspicion
upon
men
of
that
province
in
particular
was
their
general
evil
reputation
as
being
predisposed
towards
assassination
the
depositions
were
sent
to
us
by
the
governors
in
the
afternoon
of
the
and
on
discrepancies
being
pointed
out
in
those
of
the
two
tosa
men
they
promised
to
send
for
one
of
them
whose
further
examination
appeared
to
be
especially
desirable
the
translation
of
the
depositions
occupied
me
for
the
whole
of
the
succeeding
day
then
on
the
i
went
to
see
niiro
giôbu
a
satsuma
and
asked
him
to
make
an
inquiry
about
the
murder
among
his
own
people
he
said
this
had
already
been
done
and
offered
to
give
me
a
copy
of
the
record
as
he
said
that
nothing
suspicious
had
been
discovered
i
declined
his
offer
with
thanks
but
i
hinted
to
him
the
possibility
of
the
exclusion
of
all
men
from
the
foreign
settlement
after
dark
unless
the
murderers
were
discovered
and
delivered
up
by
the
combined
clans
a
measure
which
had
been
recommended
to
flowers
and
myself
by
sir
harry
for
if
the
discovery
were
made
by
the
government
it
would
be
taken
to
be
a
proof
of
the
complicity
of
his
clan
at
least
he
did
not
at
all
like
this
suggestion
then
i
went
to
sasaki
sanshirô
with
whom
i
had
travelled
from
tosa
he
said
that
the
governors
had
lent
a
steamer
to
fetch
the
captain
of
the
yokobuyé
and
another
man
and
complained
of
supposition
that
he
was
lukewarm
seeing
that
he
had
given
money
to
all
the
detectives
in
the
place
and
had
offered
a
reward
of
pieces
of
silver
worth
for
the
discovery
of
the
murderer
or
murderers
next
to
hirayama
to
whom
i
proposed
that
he
should
order
the
nagasaki
representatives
of
all
the
clans
to
examine
their
men
as
strictly
as
the
tosa
agents
were
doing
for
as
we
had
been
ten
days
at
work
without
being
able
to
fix
the
responsibility
on
them
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
admit
the
possibility
of
men
of
some
other
clan
being
guilty
i
proposed
that
every
man
should
be
called
upon
to
give
an
account
of
his
doings
on
the
night
of
the
murder
and
that
all
the
houses
of
entertainment
should
show
their
lists
of
guests
on
that
date
there
was
i
said
no
real
difficulty
in
discovering
the
perpetrators
in
consequence
of
all
this
one
of
the
governors
called
the
next
afternoon
we
proposed
to
him
that
the
men
should
be
excluded
from
the
settlement
after
dark
to
which
he
added
an
amendment
that
if
they
had
urgent
business
there
in
the
evening
they
should
be
escorted
to
and
fro
the
examination
of
all
the
clansmen
and
of
persons
who
were
in
a
house
of
entertainment
close
to
the
site
of
the
murder
was
again
urged
by
us
the
governor
also
promised
to
have
erected
at
three
points
in
the
foreign
settlement
two
days
later
the
same
governor
called
again
and
promised
that
the
precautionary
measures
we
had
proposed
to
him
should
be
taken
nothing
further
was
done
until
the
when
i
attended
at
the
custom
house
to
hear
the
examination
of
two
tosa
men
who
had
been
brought
from
kôchi
in
the
government
steamer
it
led
to
this
result
that
the
governors
declared
that
they
found
nothing
to
incriminate
any
of
the
men
who
had
left
nagasaki
in
the
yokobuyé
and
nankai
and
considered
the
tosa
people
to
be
cleared
of
all
suspicion
as
far
as
these
two
vessels
were
concerned
we
rejoined
that
on
the
contrary
we
entertained
very
strong
suspicions
not
founded
on
any
ocular
testimony
but
on
circumstantial
evidence
namely
that
the
murder
was
almost
certainly
committed
by
men
in
white
foreign
dress
a
little
after
midnight
that
one
of
the
two
men
with
a
companion
were
close
to
the
spot
where
the
murder
was
committed
at
the
very
moment
and
that
they
were
dressed
in
that
fashion
and
that
no
one
else
had
been
shown
to
have
been
in
the
brothel
quarter
in
similar
costume
we
afterwards
addressed
a
letter
to
the
governors
demanding
the
arrest
of
these
two
men
on
the
above
grounds
but
we
were
not
sanguine
of
obtaining
their
consent
as
it
was
evident
that
the
government
officials
were
unable
to
exercise
any
control
over
the
tosa
people
very
little
progress
was
made
after
this
as
was
natural
enough
seeing
that
the
tosa
people
were
entirely
innocent
of
any
share
in
the
murders
as
was
afterwards
proved
on
october
i
had
an
opportunity
of
conversing
amicably
with
the
i
said
that
the
tosa
people
tried
to
throw
obstacles
in
the
way
of
discovering
the
criminals
instead
of
courting
inquiry
in
accordance
with
prince
yôdô
expressed
wishes
that
the
government
had
lost
much
ground
with
foreigners
in
this
affair
firstly
the
possibility
of
the
murder
being
committed
in
such
a
manner
showed
the
incapacity
of
the
government
to
maintain
order
and
secondly
it
was
not
fitting
that
a
body
calling
itself
a
government
should
allow
to
enjoy
such
rights
of
extraterritoriality
to
the
extent
that
was
shown
by
the
recent
examinations
at
the
the
replied
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
these
matters
to
which
i
rejoined
that
this
was
precisely
the
reason
why
i
had
spoken
to
him
about
them
we
received
a
refusal
to
our
demand
for
the
arrest
of
the
two
tosa
men
a
few
days
later
a
drunken
englishman
was
cut
about
the
head
and
an
american
wounded
slightly
in
the
arm
by
a
tosa
man
who
straightway
gave
himself
up
to
his
own
authorities
and
they
reported
the
affair
having
failed
entirely
in
our
attempts
to
bring
the
crime
home
to
the
tosa
people
flowers
and
i
agreed
that
it
was
useless
for
me
to
remain
any
longer
and
accordingly
i
returned
to
yedo
leaving
about
midnight
of
the
october
on
board
coquette
which
had
been
lent
by
the
admiral
to
bring
me
back
to
yokohama
during
my
stay
at
nagasaki
we
heard
a
good
deal
about
the
discovery
and
arrest
of
native
roman
catholic
christians
of
urakami
a
village
near
the
town
niiro
giôbu
of
satsuma
who
came
to
see
me
on
the
october
said
that
besides
the
urakami
people
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
a
village
close
by
belonging
to
the
of
omura
had
been
converted
and
were
now
in
prison
at
nagasaki
according
to
japanese
law
this
was
a
capital
offence
the
omura
officials
had
hitherto
conformed
to
the
practice
of
the
nagasaki
government
with
respect
to
the
punishment
of
criminals
and
desired
to
act
accordingly
in
the
present
case
it
was
however
reported
that
the
governors
intended
to
pardon
all
those
who
were
willing
to
abjure
because
the
number
of
offenders
was
so
large
this
offended
the
omura
officials
who
held
that
believing
in
christianity
was
a
very
grave
crime
further
that
the
proposal
to
let
such
criminals
off
on
the
pretext
that
they
were
too
numerous
to
punish
was
revolutionary
and
subversive
of
good
government
and
they
were
endeavouring
to
induce
all
the
of
kiûshiû
to
join
in
a
representation
in
that
sense
to
the
government
at
yedo
this
proposal
was
of
course
intended
as
a
general
manifesto
against
the
government
i
replied
that
he
must
quite
well
know
that
christianity
was
not
harmful
to
any
country
by
whose
people
it
was
professed
and
that
even
a
protestant
government
such
as
that
of
england
would
not
be
pleased
to
hear
of
roman
catholics
being
persecuted
on
the
ground
of
their
religious
belief
but
if
the
only
object
of
the
remonstrance
was
to
annoy
the
shôgun
government
we
should
not
disapprove
of
that
by
itself
on
the
general
subject
of
japanese
internal
politics
he
said
he
did
not
believe
that
civil
war
would
break
out
or
at
least
he
pretended
not
to
though
at
the
same
time
he
acknowledged
its
possibility
hirayama
to
whom
i
said
on
the
same
day
told
me
that
all
the
christians
of
urakami
had
been
forgiven
on
their
promising
not
to
do
so
again
and
that
they
would
be
permitted
to
believe
what
they
liked
doubtless
on
condition
of
their
not
professing
their
religion
openly
he
thought
the
omura
officials
would
also
forgive
their
christians
this
opinion
of
his
was
however
in
contradiction
to
what
i
had
heard
from
niiro
my
stay
at
nagasaki
afforded
me
useful
opportunities
of
making
the
acquaintance
of
of
various
southern
clans
i
have
already
mentioned
my
introduction
to
kido
junichirô
the
i
spent
almost
entirely
in
the
company
of
kido
and
itô
a
few
days
later
kido
called
to
offer
me
the
use
of
a
steamer
to
ozaka
if
it
suited
me
to
return
to
yedo
by
that
route
but
i
deferred
accepting
as
my
plans
were
not
yet
settled
eventually
arrangements
were
made
for
my
being
conveyed
to
yokohama
in
one
of
ships
so
that
i
was
able
to
decline
his
obliging
proposal
when
itô
came
to
say
on
september
he
was
accompanied
by
a
young
whom
he
wished
me
to
take
to
yedo
nominally
as
a
pupil
this
was
endo
kinsuké
one
of
the
party
of
five
chôshiû
men
to
which
itô
had
belonged
who
went
secretly
to
england
in
as
already
narrated
he
bore
the
alias
of
yamamoto
jinsuké
itô
pseudonym
was
hayashi
uichi
and
inouyé
bunda
went
by
the
name
of
takada
harutarô
amongst
other
interesting
information
given
to
me
by
itô
was
that
my
friend
yamagata
keizô
who
was
one
of
the
chôshiû
men
that
had
accompanied
me
to
yokohama
in
october
had
been
adopted
by
shishido
bizen
it
was
his
father
yamagata
taiga
who
wrote
the
pamphlet
of
which
the
title
translated
is
the
equivalent
of
the
present
are
not
vassals
of
the
prince
of
the
shôgun
and
not
nagai
uta
to
whom
it
was
usually
attributed
itô
was
a
pupil
of
the
patriot
yoshida
torajirô
the
author
of
several
books
controverting
the
views
of
yamagata
and
nagai
he
said
there
were
two
schools
of
chinese
philosophy
in
japan
namely
of
teishi
and
oyômei
wang
of
which
the
first
inculcates
the
duty
of
resisting
tyrants
the
second
that
of
yamagata
belonged
to
the
latter
hence
his
arguments
against
any
attempt
to
disturb
the
existing
political
arrangements
but
the
most
widely
diffused
system
in
japan
was
that
of
the
philosopher
chu
hsi
niiro
giôbu
i
saw
four
times
i
dined
with
him
once
at
a
japanese
restaurant
when
he
said
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
engagement
of
frenchmen
by
iwashita
sajiemon
a
satsuma
man
who
had
gone
to
paris
for
the
exposition
of
and
there
came
under
the
influence
of
the
comte
de
montblanc
directly
he
heard
of
it
he
wrote
to
iwashita
that
the
engagements
must
be
cancelled
but
his
letter
did
not
reach
paris
in
time
i
said
that
of
course
we
could
not
object
to
satsuma
employing
frenchmen
but
as
french
views
of
japanese
domestic
politics
differed
so
widely
from
ours
and
it
was
well
understood
that
ours
coincided
to
a
certain
extent
with
those
of
satsuma
it
was
natural
to
ask
whether
this
engagement
implied
a
change
of
policy
on
the
part
of
the
satsuma
clan
niiro
replied
that
such
a
supposition
would
be
quite
natural
but
that
in
fact
no
such
change
had
occurred
since
the
time
when
osumi
no
kami
father
of
the
prince
of
satsuma
and
virtual
ruler
of
the
clan
notwithstanding
his
formal
retirement
from
public
life
had
decreed
the
adoption
of
english
methods
the
whole
province
had
become
enthusiastic
in
their
favour
and
objected
very
strongly
to
the
proposed
introduction
of
frenchmen
he
was
afraid
he
should
have
to
send
them
home
again
a
few
days
later
niiro
dined
with
russell
robertson
assistant
at
the
consulate
and
myself
at
robertson
house
when
we
engaged
a
french
cook
to
serve
the
dinner
on
this
occasion
no
political
conversation
took
place
but
he
told
us
that
saigô
was
osumi
no
kami
confidential
man
and
komatsu
tatéwaki
one
of
the
seven
administrators
of
the
satsuma
clan
the
prince
whose
title
was
shiuri
no
taiyu
was
years
of
age
and
his
brother
shimadzu
dzusho
altogether
there
were
ten
brothers
and
sisters
besides
the
three
girls
of
the
late
prince
satsuma
no
kami
my
last
talk
with
niiro
was
on
october
when
he
gave
me
information
about
the
native
christians
already
recorded
last
year
i
had
met
at
robertson
house
a
doctor
belonging
to
the
kurumé
clan
and
he
now
came
with
his
son
to
ask
permission
to
bring
some
of
his
fellow
clansmen
to
call
on
me
this
they
did
on
the
october
their
names
were
imae
sakai
said
to
be
connected
with
the
government
of
the
clan
nagata
chiûhei
who
was
visiting
nagasaki
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
tanaka
konoyé
originally
a
kiôto
clockmaker
he
had
developed
into
a
skilled
mechanical
engineer
and
had
constructed
engines
and
boilers
for
a
couple
of
japanese
steamers
after
drinking
a
bottle
of
champagne
together
we
sallied
forth
to
a
japanese
restaurant
where
we
had
a
little
feast
in
the
style
of
the
country
and
a
great
deal
of
political
talk
they
said
their
principal
reason
for
objecting
to
hiôgo
being
opened
as
a
port
for
foreign
trade
was
that
the
tea
consumed
at
kurumé
came
from
the
provinces
to
the
west
of
hiôgo
and
they
feared
it
would
be
diverted
to
that
place
for
exportation
with
regard
to
internal
affairs
i
said
i
did
not
see
how
they
could
be
settled
without
a
war
of
some
kind
or
other
as
the
could
not
agree
among
themselves
a
civil
war
might
last
twenty
or
thirty
years
and
greatly
impoverish
the
country
while
it
would
afford
an
opportunity
to
foreign
powers
to
appropriate
bits
of
japanese
territory
by
aiding
one
party
against
the
other
but
a
foreign
war
in
which
kiôto
became
the
object
of
attack
would
lead
to
the
reconciliation
of
their
internal
differences
and
when
peace
came
to
be
made
we
could
conclude
treaties
with
the
mikado
in
which
the
constitutional
position
of
the
tycoon
might
be
defined
nagata
who
was
already
drunk
shouted
out
you
must
not
attack
kiôto
but
destroy
the
this
was
the
term
meaning
military
power
by
which
the
adversaries
of
the
tycoon
were
in
the
habit
of
speaking
of
his
government
it
appeared
from
this
utterance
that
the
men
of
kurumé
shared
what
was
evidently
the
general
feeling
in
the
west
of
the
country
afterwards
we
adjourned
to
another
restaurant
where
a
grand
feast
was
served
more
of
the
kurumé
clan
came
in
and
the
room
was
gradually
filled
with
courtesans
and
musicians
most
of
my
friends
got
very
drunk
so
after
about
two
hours
of
this
festivity
i
left
and
the
party
broke
up
i
also
had
a
dinner
with
a
tosa
man
named
yui
who
was
captain
of
the
yugawo
another
acquaintance
i
made
was
that
of
hosokawa
riônosuké
younger
brother
of
the
prince
of
higo
who
came
to
call
on
flowers
he
had
a
fat
round
face
was
about
years
of
age
and
intelligent
he
tried
to
pump
me
about
the
tosa
affair
but
failed
and
when
he
proceeded
to
talk
politics
i
held
my
tongue
for
higo
was
supposed
not
to
belong
to
the
satsuma
party
he
then
invited
me
to
visit
him
on
board
his
steamer
and
have
a
long
conversation
but
when
i
went
at
the
appointed
hour
on
the
following
day
he
was
absent
however
next
day
two
of
his
men
called
to
apologize
for
his
breaking
the
engagement
and
he
also
appeared
in
person
to
tell
me
of
the
desire
cherished
by
the
higo
people
to
invite
sir
harry
keppel
the
admiral
in
command
of
the
china
squadron
to
some
point
off
their
coast
to
display
naval
evolutions
for
the
clan
having
ordered
an
and
two
smaller
war
steamers
to
be
built
in
england
wanted
to
learn
how
they
should
be
manoeuvred
he
was
at
great
pains
to
prove
that
he
was
on
the
best
of
terms
with
kido
katsura
and
that
the
hosokawa
brothers
loved
the
english
more
than
they
did
any
other
nation
for
all
their
steamers
besides
rifles
of
different
patterns
had
been
bought
from
us
i
replied
that
their
inviting
the
admiral
to
a
place
off
their
coast
and
not
to
the
castle
at
kumamoto
was
like
sending
for
a
troupe
of
tumblers
to
perform
before
one
house
into
which
one
would
not
care
to
admit
them
if
a
man
were
prevented
from
inviting
a
guest
to
his
own
house
it
would
be
more
courteous
to
go
and
call
on
him
than
to
ask
him
to
come
and
that
riônosuké
at
least
ought
to
come
to
nagasaki
and
visit
the
admiral
first
of
all
he
said
he
intended
going
to
shimonoséki
with
one
of
the
higo
councillor
to
arrange
an
alliance
between
higo
and
chôshiû
endo
presented
himself
on
the
but
instead
of
coming
straight
to
me
he
sent
in
his
card
by
my
aidzu
retainer
noguchi
who
read
it
and
at
once
discovered
who
he
was
we
embarked
in
the
course
of
the
evening
and
steamed
out
of
the
harbour
at
eleven
through
the
inland
sea
and
without
calling
anywhere
arrived
at
yokohama
at
midnight
on
the
chapter
xxiii
downfall
of
the
shogunate
before
leaving
yedo
i
had
taken
a
lease
of
a
house
known
as
high
mansion
on
a
bluff
overlooking
the
bay
at
a
monthly
rental
of
equal
to
it
was
the
retired
home
of
a
japanese
gentleman
of
rank
who
had
abdicated
his
position
in
favour
of
his
eldest
son
and
had
bought
a
piece
of
ground
to
build
himself
a
residence
after
his
own
taste
consequently
it
was
one
of
the
oddest
houses
imaginable
consisting
of
a
number
of
small
rooms
of
varying
sizes
and
the
garden
was
laid
out
in
little
hills
and
planted
with
trees
and
shrubs
the
only
flowers
were
those
of
the
camellia
and
st
john
wort
bushes
hypericum
chinense
for
herbaceous
borders
are
almost
impossible
to
manage
in
japan
owing
to
the
heavy
summer
rains
which
beat
down
all
plants
that
have
not
woody
stems
the
whole
covered
about
of
an
acre
there
was
an
upper
storey
where
i
had
my
bedroom
and
apartments
for
the
entertainment
of
japanese
guests
and
three
staircases
provided
means
of
escape
in
case
of
attack
from
the
midnight
murderer
downstairs
was
a
room
for
the
reception
of
european
visitors
and
two
waiting
rooms
for
callers
one
more
for
the
accommodation
of
my
head
man
and
my
own
study
this
was
nine
feet
square
with
a
circular
window
commanding
a
view
of
the
sea
and
a
square
one
at
the
side
overlooking
the
garden
it
was
fitted
up
with
numerous
small
cupboards
and
shelves
for
the
accommodation
of
books
and
papers
it
held
a
writing
desk
a
small
table
a
chair
for
myself
and
one
for
my
japanese
teacher
and
a
stool
for
the
chinese
teacher
attached
to
the
legation
there
were
also
a
large
bathroom
a
kitchen
and
a
building
beyond
where
my
head
man
lived
and
where
the
young
japanese
to
whom
i
intended
to
teach
english
were
to
be
lodged
my
food
was
entirely
in
the
japanese
style
sent
in
from
the
house
called
mansei
but
i
continued
to
drink
english
beer
the
household
consisted
of
my
head
man
the
aidzu
noguchi
who
has
been
already
mentioned
whose
function
was
to
superintend
everything
pay
my
bills
arrange
for
necessary
repairs
and
receive
persons
who
came
on
business
which
did
not
require
a
personal
interview
with
myself
next
to
him
came
a
small
boy
of
fourteen
who
waited
at
table
and
acted
as
valet
he
was
of
the
class
and
so
entitled
to
wear
sword
and
dagger
when
he
went
abroad
then
there
was
a
woman
of
about
thirty
years
of
age
whose
duty
it
was
to
sweep
the
floors
open
the
sliding
shutters
in
the
morning
and
close
them
at
night
and
sew
on
my
buttons
as
there
was
hardly
any
furniture
she
had
very
little
dusting
to
do
i
was
to
engage
a
man
to
go
not
run
on
errands
perhaps
cook
the
rice
for
the
whole
family
and
make
himself
generally
useful
lastly
came
a
gatekeeper
who
had
also
the
duty
of
sweeping
the
garden
and
a
groom
or
running
footman
when
i
went
out
walking
or
on
horseback
i
was
accompanied
by
a
couple
of
the
mounted
escort
that
had
been
attached
to
me
by
the
tycoon
government
since
my
journey
overland
from
ozaka
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
year
thus
established
as
a
householder
after
my
own
liking
able
to
devote
myself
to
japanese
studies
and
to
live
intimately
with
japanese
and
thus
become
acquainted
with
their
thoughts
and
views
i
was
perfectly
happy
in
my
journal
i
find
noted
down
a
dinner
on
november
with
nakamura
matazô
at
the
near
shimbashi
with
of
course
to
pour
out
the
and
entertain
us
with
music
and
bright
conversation
and
on
the
a
dinner
of
broiled
eels
and
rice
at
the
daikokuya
reiganbashi
with
yanagawa
shunsan
a
teacher
at
the
foreign
language
school
the
political
ferment
threw
a
great
deal
of
work
on
me
in
interpreting
for
sir
harry
in
his
talks
with
government
people
and
in
translating
official
papers
from
and
into
japanese
and
these
duties
often
occupied
me
from
nine
in
the
morning
till
nine
in
the
evening
with
only
short
intervals
for
meals
in
the
dead
of
night
on
november
ishikawa
kawachi
no
kami
one
of
the
commissioners
for
foreign
affairs
came
to
impart
to
sir
harry
the
momentous
news
that
the
tycoon
had
resigned
the
direction
of
government
into
the
hands
of
the
mikado
and
in
future
would
simply
be
the
instrument
for
carrying
out
his
majesty
orders
we
had
heard
from
other
sources
that
he
had
abdicated
and
that
the
office
of
shôgun
would
cease
to
exist
already
on
the
ogasawara
iki
no
kami
had
told
us
confidentially
that
the
programme
of
the
future
consisted
of
a
council
of
the
great
decision
by
the
tycoon
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
mikado
the
actual
date
of
keiki
resignation
was
november
for
the
detailed
circumstances
of
this
event
i
must
refer
the
reader
to
chapter
of
my
friend
valuable
volume
the
progress
of
japan
at
an
interview
with
sir
harry
two
days
afterwards
iki
no
kami
read
out
a
long
paper
explaining
the
causes
which
had
led
to
the
decision
to
surrender
the
government
into
the
hands
of
the
mikado
he
went
into
a
long
retrospect
of
affairs
from
the
commencement
of
the
renewed
intercourse
with
foreign
nations
the
blame
was
of
course
thrown
on
the
agitators
for
political
change
keiki
it
said
had
not
resigned
the
chieftainship
of
the
tokugawa
clan
but
had
simply
abolished
the
office
of
shôgun
the
new
arrangement
would
not
involve
any
change
in
the
previous
agreements
about
the
opening
of
the
new
ports
which
had
been
entered
into
earlier
in
the
year
two
of
the
council
of
state
nui
no
kami
and
hiôbu
taiyu
were
off
to
kiôto
katsu
awa
no
kami
told
us
that
he
was
afraid
that
the
tycoon
party
would
precipitate
events
and
cause
the
outbreak
of
civil
war
kanéko
taisuké
a
retainer
of
sakai
hida
no
kami
told
us
that
the
were
collecting
troops
at
ozaka
satsuma
had
men
and
chôshiû
and
tosa
men
under
the
command
of
môri
nagato
were
also
encamped
there
so
that
we
should
find
ourselves
in
a
hornets
nest
when
we
went
down
to
superintend
the
opening
of
the
ports
the
tycoon
had
ordered
or
men
to
be
despatched
thither
the
council
of
state
had
informed
his
chief
and
matsudaira
hôki
no
kami
that
in
future
they
might
be
or
mikado
men
as
they
liked
a
secret
circular
had
been
sent
round
among
the
retainers
of
the
tokugawa
chief
holding
fiefs
assessed
at
less
than
of
rice
inciting
them
against
keiki
by
accusing
him
of
having
poisoned
the
previous
shôgun
iyémochi
and
calling
upon
the
faithful
to
assemble
at
mukôjima
a
suburb
of
yedo
the
or
drilled
troops
were
clamouring
for
their
pay
civil
war
at
kiôto
was
inevitable
truly
it
seemed
as
if
the
end
of
the
old
régime
had
come
a
week
later
iki
no
kami
circulated
another
paper
to
be
substituted
for
the
first
in
which
he
had
vented
a
little
too
much
abuse
of
the
party
matters
had
quieted
down
very
much
in
the
interval
kanéko
also
came
to
us
and
confessed
that
there
was
no
foundation
for
the
rumours
he
had
previously
reported
last
night
there
arrived
a
letter
from
gotô
shôjirô
brought
by
gotô
kiûjirô
one
of
the
aliases
of
him
whom
we
afterwards
knew
so
well
as
nakai
kôzô
and
a
companion
they
produced
a
copy
of
the
tosa
memorial
of
last
month
advising
the
tycoon
to
take
the
step
he
had
since
adopted
and
proposing
various
reforms
of
these
the
most
important
were
the
establishment
of
an
assembly
composed
of
two
houses
the
erection
of
schools
of
science
and
literature
in
the
principal
cities
and
the
negotiation
of
new
treaties
with
foreign
powers
they
asked
me
for
detailed
information
about
parliamentary
practice
which
i
did
not
possess
so
i
put
them
off
by
promising
that
they
should
get
it
from
mitford
when
we
went
to
ozaka
for
the
opening
of
the
ports
they
were
succeeded
the
following
day
by
a
messenger
from
yoshii
kôsuké
of
satsuma
to
report
that
all
was
going
on
well
and
that
they
hoped
to
be
favoured
with
a
call
as
soon
as
we
reached
ozaka
saigô
and
komatsu
had
gone
down
to
kagoshima
to
fetch
either
osumi
no
kami
or
shiuri
no
taiyu
we
had
now
become
acquainted
with
the
satsuma
agents
in
yedo
the
as
the
principal
representative
of
a
was
called
shinosaki
hikojirô
scoffed
at
the
notion
that
the
tycoon
had
given
up
the
reins
of
government
because
he
thought
it
would
be
better
for
the
country
at
large
to
be
ruled
by
an
assembly
the
fact
was
that
he
could
not
help
himself
messages
arrived
by
post
from
tosa
and
satsuma
the
two
or
three
clans
acquainted
with
the
dispositions
of
foreigners
mentioned
in
the
mikado
most
recent
edict
respecting
foreign
affairs
this
seemed
to
indicate
a
pretty
strong
desire
to
gain
our
support
we
now
prepared
to
start
for
ozaka
on
the
november
i
went
down
to
yokohama
with
my
little
pupil
tetsu
dressed
like
a
mitford
and
i
sailed
on
the
at
daylight
in
rattler
captain
swann
on
december
as
we
were
steaming
up
the
kii
channel
we
encountered
a
strong
northwest
breeze
against
which
the
ship
could
only
do
two
knots
so
deficient
in
were
the
british
of
that
period
we
anchored
off
ozaka
in
the
afternoon
and
as
no
boats
put
off
from
the
shore
we
had
to
conclude
that
the
bar
was
impassable
however
we
managed
to
get
ashore
about
noon
and
proceeded
to
call
on
the
governors
at
their
official
residence
opposite
the
castle
it
is
a
remarkable
proof
of
mitford
linguistic
powers
that
he
was
able
to
carry
on
the
conversation
in
japanese
entirely
unaided
although
he
had
been
in
the
country
no
longer
than
twelve
months
our
mission
was
to
find
quarters
for
the
legation
and
after
consultation
with
them
we
went
to
inspect
a
behind
the
castle
which
had
been
occupied
in
the
spring
by
iga
no
kami
keiki
principal
minister
we
arranged
for
its
repair
and
for
the
construction
of
a
temporary
barrack
for
the
mounted
escort
and
a
detachment
of
fifty
men
of
the
regiment
who
were
to
arrive
as
a
guard
everything
was
to
be
ready
by
the
if
possible
this
peaceable
and
entirely
commercial
city
was
full
of
retainers
of
finding
that
saigô
had
not
yet
returned
from
kagoshima
and
that
yoshii
was
in
kiôto
we
wrote
to
the
latter
asking
him
to
come
down
to
see
us
but
he
replied
that
he
was
too
busy
and
recommended
us
to
wait
until
saigô
came
back
we
visited
the
site
of
the
intended
foreign
settlement
where
we
found
bonded
warehouses
a
a
guardhouse
and
a
palisade
being
erected
the
object
of
the
latter
being
to
cut
off
the
foreign
residents
from
the
city
this
proceeding
was
altogether
contrary
to
treaty
stipulations
and
we
lost
no
time
in
lodging
a
protest
with
the
governors
on
december
we
called
on
two
of
the
council
of
state
and
their
colleagues
of
the
second
council
inaba
hiôbu
taiyu
matsudaira
nui
no
kami
nagai
hizen
no
kami
and
kawakatsu
bingo
no
kami
who
were
on
their
way
to
yedo
and
had
orders
from
the
tycoon
to
stop
at
ozaka
to
see
us
they
gave
us
no
information
worth
mentioning
but
asserted
that
he
had
long
ago
been
intending
to
take
the
step
of
surrendering
the
government
to
the
mikado
this
of
course
we
did
not
believe
our
view
being
that
he
was
tired
of
being
badgered
by
satsuma
chôshiû
tosa
and
hizen
and
that
in
order
to
give
unity
to
his
own
party
he
had
resolved
to
call
a
general
council
which
possibly
might
reinstate
him
by
a
majority
of
votes
and
thus
establish
his
authority
more
strongly
than
ever
on
december
having
transacted
all
our
business
at
ozaka
we
started
in
palanquins
for
hiôgo
mitford
walked
as
far
as
which
he
reached
in
hours
and
i
in
a
palanquin
took
more
by
three
in
the
afternoon
after
travelling
six
hours
we
had
got
only
so
we
betook
ourselves
to
shanks
mare
japanese
teacher
nagazawa
and
our
escort
had
to
trot
in
order
to
keep
pace
with
us
and
we
got
on
board
the
rattler
soon
after
six
having
dined
with
captain
swann
we
went
ashore
again
and
took
up
our
quarters
for
the
night
at
the
municipal
office
next
day
we
called
on
the
newly
appointed
governor
shibata
hiuga
no
kami
to
discuss
various
business
details
he
told
us
that
there
had
been
a
week
of
feasting
at
kôbé
in
honour
of
the
anticipated
opening
of
the
port
with
processions
of
people
dressed
in
red
silk
crape
with
carts
which
were
supposed
to
be
transporting
earth
to
raise
the
site
of
the
proposed
foreign
settlement
its
situation
appeared
to
us
entirely
satisfactory
fêtes
at
hiôgo
itself
were
also
projected
these
we
took
to
be
marked
signs
of
goodwill
on
the
part
of
both
government
and
people
and
to
promise
a
great
extension
of
friendly
intercourse
between
japanese
and
foreigners
the
same
day
we
returned
to
ozaka
by
boat
accompanied
by
noel
afterwards
admiral
sir
gerard
noel
first
lieutenant
of
the
rattler
there
we
found
the
whole
population
occupied
with
festivities
in
honour
of
the
approaching
opening
of
the
city
to
foreign
trade
crowds
of
people
in
holiday
garb
dancing
and
singing
ii
ja
nai
ka
ii
ja
nai
ka
is
it
good
houses
decorated
with
in
all
colours
oranges
little
bags
straw
and
flowers
the
dresses
worn
were
chiefly
red
crape
a
few
blue
and
purple
many
of
the
dancers
carried
red
lanterns
on
their
heads
the
pretext
for
these
rejoicings
was
a
shower
of
pieces
of
paper
bearing
the
names
of
the
two
gods
of
isé
alleged
to
have
taken
place
recently
on
the
we
received
a
visit
from
our
satsuma
friend
yoshii
he
told
us
that
the
coalition
which
was
determined
to
push
matters
to
the
last
extremity
in
order
to
gain
their
points
consisted
of
satsuma
tosa
uwajima
chôshiû
and
geishiû
higo
and
arima
were
inclined
to
join
hizen
and
chikuzen
indifferent
on
the
whole
it
might
safely
be
said
that
all
the
western
clans
were
pretty
much
of
one
mind
osumi
no
kami
who
suffered
a
good
deal
from
a
sort
of
dropsy
of
the
legs
was
too
ill
to
come
to
kiôto
and
shiuri
no
taiyu
was
to
take
his
place
arriving
in
a
few
days
saedani
umétarô
a
tosa
man
whose
acquaintance
i
had
made
at
nagasaki
had
been
murdered
a
few
days
ago
at
his
lodgings
in
kiôto
by
three
men
unknown
the
tycoon
had
about
troops
at
kiôto
satsuma
and
tosa
about
half
that
number
between
them
part
in
kiôto
part
in
ozaka
other
such
as
geishiû
would
also
bring
up
troops
the
chôshiû
question
would
be
difficult
to
settle
peacefully
as
the
tycoon
party
included
a
large
number
of
men
who
wished
to
force
on
a
renewal
of
the
war
in
order
to
effect
the
complete
destruction
of
that
clan
i
took
occasion
to
say
that
the
murder
of
our
sailors
at
nagasaki
was
by
no
means
disposed
of
and
that
one
of
the
first
demands
to
be
laid
by
us
before
the
new
government
would
be
for
the
punishment
of
the
murderers
that
no
money
compensation
would
be
accepted
and
that
the
japanese
if
they
wished
to
remain
on
good
terms
with
foreigners
and
to
avoid
a
disaster
had
better
prevent
the
occurrence
of
such
incidents
yoshii
replied
that
if
internal
affairs
were
not
placed
on
a
sound
footing
on
the
present
occasion
the
would
wreak
their
wrath
upon
foreigners
in
order
to
provoke
bad
relations
between
the
tycoon
and
the
treaty
powers
i
responded
that
they
would
not
gain
their
object
as
we
could
no
longer
hold
the
tycoon
responsible
for
the
acts
of
persons
over
whom
he
had
no
real
control
on
the
i
received
a
visit
from
two
uwajima
men
sutô
tajima
and
saionji
yukiyé
the
former
a
man
of
high
rank
in
his
clan
the
other
an
official
whom
i
had
met
when
i
was
at
uwajima
in
the
spring
of
the
year
they
had
come
up
to
ozaka
as
precursors
of
daté
iyo
no
kami
who
was
expected
to
arrive
early
in
january
they
represented
him
as
greatly
pleased
with
the
existing
prospect
of
the
establishment
of
a
parliament
regarding
which
the
old
prince
had
talked
to
me
on
more
than
one
occasion
i
mentioned
the
nagasaki
affair
in
similar
terms
to
those
i
had
used
to
yoshii
and
assured
them
that
the
question
of
reparation
was
by
no
means
abandoned
but
was
simply
in
abeyance
for
the
present
and
i
explained
that
we
were
on
as
good
terms
with
tosa
as
before
no
sooner
had
they
gone
than
nakai
came
in
to
say
that
gotô
had
arrived
the
previous
evening
but
was
too
busy
to
call
on
us
we
offered
to
call
on
him
instead
of
his
coming
to
us
a
proposal
which
was
joyfully
accepted
and
meeting
gotô
in
front
of
the
tosa
agency
we
turned
in
there
with
him
our
first
topic
was
the
murder
of
our
two
sailors
we
said
that
though
the
particular
suspicion
against
tosa
was
removed
by
the
discovery
that
there
was
no
foundation
for
the
report
of
the
yokobuyé
and
nankai
leaving
the
port
together
on
the
night
of
the
murder
the
fact
that
our
men
had
been
killed
by
japanese
still
remained
and
that
we
should
not
rest
until
redress
was
afforded
not
in
the
shape
of
a
pecuniary
indemnity
which
some
people
appeared
to
suppose
would
satisfy
the
british
government
but
by
the
punishment
of
the
criminals
and
that
we
were
content
to
wait
until
the
establishment
of
the
new
constitution
gave
us
an
opportunity
for
presenting
our
demand
with
effect
he
replied
that
the
recent
murder
of
two
of
his
own
subordinates
inspired
him
with
sympathy
for
our
feelings
and
that
both
the
yôdô
and
he
himself
held
that
no
stone
should
be
left
unturned
to
discover
the
criminals
i
then
asked
him
to
take
charge
of
a
gun
which
i
wished
to
present
to
yôdô
as
a
small
return
though
not
of
any
great
value
or
beauty
for
his
kindness
to
me
we
then
discussed
the
constitution
which
he
proposed
for
the
new
government
and
particularly
the
senate
he
desired
to
see
established
the
upshot
of
the
conversation
was
that
he
promised
to
come
down
from
kiôto
to
see
the
chief
on
his
arrival
and
to
stay
a
few
days
at
ozaka
in
order
to
learn
more
from
mitford
and
myself
about
the
english
form
of
government
all
we
could
do
on
that
occasion
was
to
give
him
some
information
about
the
composition
of
the
cabinet
and
the
method
of
carrying
legislation
through
parliament
gotô
said
he
wanted
to
employ
a
foreigner
such
as
myself
for
instance
to
collect
information
for
him
and
with
whom
he
could
consult
i
replied
that
i
was
content
to
serve
my
own
government
and
could
not
take
service
under
that
of
any
other
state
but
that
if
the
clan
wanted
the
services
of
an
officer
they
should
apply
to
the
minister
for
the
loan
of
one
the
idea
of
taking
from
a
japanese
however
highly
placed
did
not
suit
me
and
i
was
resolved
in
case
i
quitted
her
majesty
service
not
to
seek
another
career
in
japan
that
evening
we
that
is
mitford
noel
and
i
devoted
to
a
en
in
the
japanese
fashion
at
a
sort
of
trois
frères
called
tokaku
and
about
six
we
started
forth
it
was
expected
that
the
streets
would
be
full
of
and
the
two
men
of
my
escort
who
were
detailed
to
accompany
us
wished
that
the
rest
of
them
should
be
summoned
to
attend
us
but
i
threw
the
burden
of
decision
on
their
shoulders
by
saying
that
i
thought
the
two
of
them
would
be
enough
for
anything
and
no
more
was
heard
of
that
proposition
so
we
issued
into
the
streets
and
dived
through
all
sorts
of
back
lanes
to
find
a
shorter
cut
for
my
instinct
seemed
to
show
the
road
but
our
escort
triumphed
after
all
and
they
brought
us
to
the
place
of
entertainment
by
what
proved
to
be
a
circuitous
route
some
difficulty
was
experienced
in
making
our
way
through
the
crowds
of
people
in
flaming
red
garments
dancing
and
shouting
the
refrain
ja
nai
they
were
so
much
taken
up
with
their
dancing
and
that
we
passed
along
almost
unnoticed
but
i
was
half
afraid
the
escort
would
provoke
a
quarrel
by
the
violent
manner
in
which
they
thrust
people
aside
in
order
to
make
way
for
us
on
the
contrary
the
crowd
did
not
offer
any
rudeness
to
us
and
let
us
pass
without
hindrance
on
reaching
tokaku
we
found
the
principal
rooms
occupied
by
festival
makers
and
the
rest
of
the
house
shut
up
our
messenger
had
been
just
that
instant
turned
away
with
a
refusal
to
receive
us
while
we
stood
there
trying
to
persuade
the
people
of
the
house
to
give
us
a
room
a
herd
of
young
men
and
boys
trooped
in
shouting
and
dancing
and
tossing
about
in
their
midst
a
palanquin
occupied
by
a
fat
doll
clad
in
the
most
gorgeous
robes
all
the
feasters
in
the
house
came
out
to
meet
them
one
can
not
say
at
the
doors
for
in
japan
there
are
no
doors
but
on
the
thresholds
in
which
the
sliding
screens
run
that
divide
the
different
parts
of
a
house
after
a
violent
united
dance
executed
by
all
present
the
troop
disappeared
again
the
number
of
pretty
girls
who
appeared
as
dancers
was
much
larger
than
previous
experience
had
led
us
to
suppose
ozaka
could
possibly
contain
we
could
not
prevail
on
the
tokaku
people
to
take
us
in
but
they
gave
us
a
guide
to
a
house
about
five
minutes
walk
distant
there
we
found
the
doors
locked
the
explanation
being
that
all
the
inmates
had
gone
to
the
dance
we
began
to
despair
of
success
and
contemplate
the
possibility
of
having
to
return
to
our
quarters
and
sup
on
whatever
cold
food
the
philosopher
mitford
chinese
servant
could
give
us
luckily
however
the
guide
a
little
man
on
sturdy
legs
said
he
knew
of
a
house
called
hall
of
the
old
man
of
the
pine
tree
where
we
might
as
well
call
since
it
lay
on
our
road
home
so
we
went
there
and
after
waiting
a
few
minutes
were
shown
into
a
very
good
room
where
we
had
our
meal
waited
on
by
the
women
of
the
house
who
carried
on
the
conversation
and
passed
the
wine
cup
offices
usually
discharged
on
such
occasions
by
the
entire
absence
of
fear
or
dislike
on
the
part
of
the
ozaka
women
was
very
remarkable
when
compared
with
the
cold
and
often
hostile
reception
we
were
accustomed
to
meet
with
in
yedo
curiosity
apparently
triumphed
over
every
other
feeling
and
besides
the
attendants
mostly
had
their
teeth
dyed
black
a
sign
of
mature
age
instead
of
wearing
them
as
they
are
naturally
and
probably
felt
immune
from
attempts
at
flirtation
we
got
home
early
very
pleased
with
our
adventure
noel
returned
next
day
to
his
ship
and
we
moved
over
from
our
lodgings
in
to
the
quarters
prepared
for
the
whole
legation
behind
the
castle
the
main
building
was
large
enough
to
accommodate
the
minister
and
three
or
four
members
of
what
he
delighted
to
call
the
staff
a
military
term
picked
up
during
his
campaigns
in
china
the
outbuildings
were
given
up
to
mitford
the
officers
of
the
detachment
from
the
regiment
shared
a
second
guests
were
to
be
put
up
in
a
third
the
mounted
escort
in
a
fourth
and
the
fifth
i
reserved
for
myself
a
temporary
shed
was
provided
for
the
infantry
guard
after
settling
in
we
went
to
call
on
saigô
with
whom
we
found
iwashita
sajiémon
just
back
from
europe
accompanied
by
his
friend
the
comte
de
montblanc
the
conversation
turned
on
the
murder
of
the
two
bluejackets
of
icarus
saigô
paid
me
the
compliment
of
saying
that
i
gave
little
hits
but
hard
ones
opinion
seemed
to
be
divided
as
to
the
probability
of
more
such
murders
being
committed
i
used
to
find
that
men
who
desired
the
progress
of
japan
and
were
actuated
by
friendly
feeling
towards
its
people
maintained
that
the
attacks
on
foreigners
would
cease
but
that
unprejudiced
observers
did
not
give
one
much
encouragement
to
leave
off
the
practice
of
carrying
revolvers
we
gave
them
clearly
to
understand
that
the
icarus
affair
could
not
be
disposed
of
by
the
payment
of
a
sum
of
money
by
way
of
indemnity
they
were
anxious
to
disprove
the
possibility
of
there
having
been
a
plot
on
the
part
of
tosa
and
satsuma
men
to
murder
mitford
and
myself
when
we
passed
through
fushimi
in
the
previous
august
fortunately
we
changed
our
route
for
other
reasons
but
i
had
no
doubt
myself
of
the
fact
noguchi
had
told
me
when
we
reached
ozaka
that
he
had
overheard
some
men
whom
he
believed
to
be
tosa
expressing
their
regret
at
having
failed
to
carry
out
their
project
and
when
i
told
gotô
at
susaki
that
i
had
heard
this
story
he
replied
that
being
in
kiôto
at
the
time
he
too
had
heard
such
a
report
and
took
measures
to
prevent
the
scheme
if
there
were
one
from
being
carried
out
saigô
tried
to
show
that
it
could
not
have
been
true
and
asserted
that
gotô
was
not
then
in
kiôto
we
assured
him
that
we
did
not
think
it
probable
that
men
of
either
satsuma
or
tosa
would
desire
to
take
the
lives
of
foreigners
but
that
the
clans
contained
ruffians
who
sometimes
took
such
ideas
into
their
heads
quite
independently
of
their
chiefs
ishikawa
kawachi
no
kami
a
commissioner
of
foreign
affairs
came
to
see
us
on
the
he
told
us
that
no
date
had
been
fixed
for
the
assembling
of
the
and
no
one
of
them
could
be
blamed
if
he
arrived
at
kiôto
later
than
the
others
even
supposing
that
the
few
who
were
already
there
or
were
about
to
arrive
should
discuss
matters
and
come
to
a
decision
how
could
they
enforce
it
objections
would
surely
be
raised
we
came
to
the
conclusion
from
this
conversation
that
civil
war
was
after
all
not
unlikely
to
break
out
and
that
the
omission
to
fix
a
date
for
the
assembly
was
part
of
the
tycoon
plan
for
embarrassing
his
opponents
letters
which
arrived
overland
from
yedo
on
the
reported
the
general
impression
to
be
that
there
was
no
more
a
tycoon
and
that
keiki
was
nobody
so
much
did
distance
and
report
by
word
of
mouth
change
the
look
of
the
situation
itô
shunsuké
opinion
was
that
war
would
begin
almost
immediately
with
the
object
of
depriving
the
tycoon
of
a
part
of
his
domains
which
were
far
too
large
for
the
peace
of
the
country
he
had
only
seven
battalions
of
infantry
in
kiôto
all
reinforcements
having
been
countermanded
in
the
belief
that
no
cause
for
war
existed
of
course
hiôgo
and
ozaka
would
not
be
the
most
peaceful
places
of
residence
for
foreigners
if
war
did
break
out
and
our
legation
situated
just
at
the
back
of
the
ozaka
castle
would
be
endangered
as
that
fortress
was
certain
to
be
the
centre
of
a
severe
conflict
in
arms
he
wanted
to
know
whether
sir
harry
arrival
and
the
opening
of
hiôgo
and
ozaka
to
foreign
trade
could
not
be
deferred
and
whether
saigô
had
written
to
the
chief
to
make
this
proposal
i
said
no
of
course
though
i
did
not
know
then
said
he
their
object
must
be
to
open
these
two
places
and
so
content
foreigners
while
the
japanese
went
on
with
their
plans
for
the
reformation
of
the
government
some
one
however
must
be
appointed
to
represent
japan
at
ozaka
and
hiôgo
i
suggested
the
present
governors
but
he
replied
that
they
would
immediately
be
expelled
when
the
crisis
arrived
i
rejoined
that
as
long
as
the
insurgent
forces
did
not
attack
the
residences
of
foreigners
they
might
do
as
they
liked
with
the
tycoon
but
that
if
they
interfered
with
us
they
would
have
a
couple
of
english
regiments
and
all
the
foreign
to
fight
against
as
well
as
the
tokugawa
troops
itô
did
not
think
they
would
wish
to
do
this
and
promised
to
let
me
know
beforehand
when
the
actual
day
for
taking
action
became
imminent
a
body
of
chôshiû
men
was
coming
up
under
the
command
of
môri
heirokurô
and
fukumoto
shima
katsura
kido
and
kikkawa
kemmotsu
being
obliged
to
remain
at
home
to
carry
on
the
administration
of
the
province
sir
harry
arrived
on
december
took
a
look
at
the
legation
quarters
and
then
went
back
to
the
ship
that
had
brought
him
down
there
was
a
fine
confusion
all
day
i
received
a
letter
from
shinosaki
yatarô
comparing
the
present
condition
of
the
country
to
an
eggshell
held
in
the
hand
and
begging
me
to
persuade
komatsu
and
saigô
to
keep
the
peace
on
christmas
day
kasuya
chikugo
no
kami
a
commissioner
of
foreign
affairs
called
he
said
that
the
of
hikoné
bizen
and
geishiû
all
three
men
of
importance
were
in
kiôto
and
he
appeared
to
be
doubtful
what
was
going
to
happen
my
old
friend
hayashi
kenzô
who
had
made
the
cruise
in
argus
with
me
in
january
called
on
the
and
reported
that
chôshiû
men
had
disembarked
at
nishinomiya
on
the
under
the
command
of
môri
takumi
he
also
seemed
uncertain
whether
there
would
be
any
fighting
but
he
thought
that
saigô
and
gotô
were
trying
to
keep
the
peace
my
protégé
endo
naturally
went
off
to
nishinomiya
to
see
his
clansmen
and
doubtless
to
report
what
he
had
learned
in
yedo
to
môri
takumi
the
latter
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
man
of
capacity
which
was
perhaps
the
reason
why
he
had
retired
into
a
private
position
early
in
life
on
the
iga
no
kami
came
to
see
the
chief
accompanied
by
nagai
gemba
no
kami
who
had
the
credit
of
being
almost
the
only
adviser
of
the
tycoon
at
the
moment
though
of
course
iga
no
kami
was
admitted
into
their
secrets
all
the
governors
of
ozaka
and
hiôgo
were
present
and
the
only
subjects
of
discussion
related
to
the
arrangement
for
opening
these
places
to
trade
on
january
all
the
governors
is
the
phrase
because
the
practice
in
those
days
was
to
duplicate
nearly
every
administrative
office
next
day
the
two
great
men
came
again
and
the
nagasaki
murders
were
the
topic
of
conversation
it
appeared
unlikely
that
we
should
obtain
any
satisfaction
it
was
however
agreed
that
old
hirayama
should
again
go
to
nagasaki
in
spite
of
gemba
efforts
to
get
him
let
off
this
disagreeable
errand
the
foreign
office
had
written
approving
sir
harry
action
and
he
seemed
inclined
to
keep
this
question
hanging
over
the
tycoon
government
as
a
perpetual
nightmare
he
told
them
in
the
strongest
language
that
we
would
never
desist
from
pressing
the
matter
until
the
murderers
were
seized
and
punished
our
callers
asked
a
great
number
of
questions
about
the
english
constitution
just
as
gotô
had
done
so
that
it
appeared
as
if
both
parties
were
desirous
of
getting
our
advice
then
sir
harry
told
them
that
unless
they
got
all
troops
away
from
ozaka
where
they
might
come
into
collision
with
foreigners
he
would
send
for
a
couple
of
regiments
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
it
was
unfair
of
him
to
meddle
in
this
way
in
japanese
domestic
affairs
and
thus
add
to
the
tycoon
embarrassments
for
as
the
forces
had
taken
ozaka
merely
as
a
stage
towards
advancing
on
kiôto
where
else
could
they
go
except
to
the
capital
following
on
this
move
he
sent
me
the
following
day
to
koba
dennai
the
satsuma
agent
to
explain
why
he
wished
their
troops
to
be
removed
koba
replied
that
there
were
only
two
hundred
and
fifty
but
doubtless
they
could
be
sent
elsewhere
and
he
would
write
to
saigô
on
this
point
from
there
i
went
on
to
see
a
chôshiû
man
named
nagamatsu
bunsuké
who
had
come
over
from
nishinomiya
and
was
stopping
with
the
geishiû
people
a
proclamation
was
out
announcing
that
the
chôshiû
forces
having
been
ordered
to
come
up
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
capital
were
allowed
to
borrow
the
use
of
the
geishiû
and
to
be
quartered
also
at
the
nishi
hongwanji
temple
nevertheless
they
had
no
wish
to
come
to
ozaka
and
thought
it
a
great
piece
of
luck
that
the
english
minister
had
proposed
to
the
tycoon
people
what
they
themselves
happened
to
desire
most
particularly
i
found
it
impossible
to
get
any
explanation
from
nagamatsu
of
the
real
reason
for
their
coming
iga
no
kami
had
told
us
that
by
a
messenger
who
left
geishiû
on
the
instructions
were
sent
ordering
them
not
to
come
but
he
went
by
sea
thus
missing
a
chôshiû
messenger
who
arrived
there
by
land
to
report
that
they
were
starting
in
compliance
with
the
orders
previously
given
this
was
evidently
a
mere
fiction
he
also
said
that
on
the
three
chôshiû
steamers
full
of
troops
put
in
at
mitarai
in
geishiû
and
asked
for
geishiû
officers
to
accompany
them
this
request
was
refused
and
they
were
advised
to
return
home
which
they
declined
to
do
alleging
their
prince
orders
without
a
recall
from
him
they
were
unable
to
go
back
to
chôshiû
this
was
the
geishiû
story
which
it
was
impossible
to
believe
i
felt
certain
that
it
had
been
concocted
between
the
two
clans
and
was
simply
in
accordance
with
the
general
plan
of
campaign
that
the
tycoon
should
have
sent
orders
to
countermand
the
movements
of
chôshiû
troops
was
pretty
clear
proof
that
when
the
original
instructions
were
given
if
they
really
were
given
the
present
change
of
policy
on
the
part
of
the
government
was
not
contemplated
as
iki
no
kami
had
pretended
to
us
but
in
reality
had
recently
been
forced
on
them
by
the
confederate
daimiôs
it
had
been
intended
by
the
chief
that
i
should
go
down
to
nishinomiya
to
ascertain
how
the
land
lay
but
having
learnt
all
that
the
chôshiû
man
was
willing
to
tell
me
i
was
relieved
from
the
necessity
of
undertaking
a
toilsome
journey
that
day
the
last
of
the
year
despatches
arrived
from
the
foreign
office
sanctioning
my
appointment
as
japanese
secretary
with
a
salary
of
a
year
in
succession
to
eusden
transferred
to
hakodaté
as
consul
chapter
xxiv
outbreak
of
civil
war
on
new
year
day
salutes
were
fired
at
tempôzan
the
fort
at
the
mouth
of
the
ozaka
river
and
at
hiôgo
in
honour
of
the
opening
of
the
city
and
the
port
to
foreign
trade
many
japanese
had
been
under
the
impression
that
it
had
been
deferred
owing
to
the
notification
about
the
west
coast
port
niigata
which
they
took
to
mean
hiôgo
because
of
its
situation
west
of
kiôto
i
conceived
a
plan
for
taking
the
chief
up
to
kiôto
to
mediate
between
the
contending
parties
and
to
prevent
the
japanese
from
cutting
each
other
throats
and
i
proposed
to
go
ahead
of
him
to
fushimi
in
order
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
with
saigô
and
gotô
but
this
ambitious
scheme
was
frustrated
by
the
rapidity
with
which
events
developed
at
kiôto
rumour
was
very
busy
during
the
next
few
days
first
we
heard
that
the
two
princes
of
chôshiû
had
been
reinstated
in
their
titles
the
tosa
yôdô
landed
on
the
afternoon
of
january
and
went
up
to
kiôto
at
once
without
stopping
at
ozaka
it
was
said
that
the
position
was
weak
for
he
had
no
support
except
from
aidzu
and
one
or
two
of
the
smaller
clans
chôshiû
people
had
taken
military
possession
of
nishinomiya
and
were
patrolling
the
surrounding
country
as
if
afraid
of
being
attacked
my
man
noguchi
told
us
that
the
chôshiû
troops
had
left
nishinomiya
and
marched
ten
miles
to
koya
on
the
road
to
kiôto
all
the
aidzu
men
at
ozaka
had
gone
up
to
kiôto
the
prince
was
dissatisfied
with
the
tycoon
leniency
in
the
chôshiû
business
and
intended
to
resign
his
office
of
guardian
of
the
mikado
person
on
the
january
there
were
symptoms
of
a
great
disturbance
at
kiôto
the
ministers
of
the
other
treaty
powers
came
to
visit
the
chief
and
impart
their
views
of
what
had
passed
for
the
most
part
these
were
of
very
slight
value
for
they
were
very
much
in
the
dark
as
to
the
internal
condition
of
japan
von
brandt
the
chargé
of
the
north
german
confederation
was
so
little
acquainted
with
the
geography
of
the
country
as
to
confound
geishiû
and
kishiû
endo
who
had
come
back
from
nishinomiya
told
me
that
môri
takumi
was
already
at
kiôto
with
part
of
the
chôshiû
force
and
that
another
part
had
occupied
fushimi
in
conjunction
with
satsuma
troops
but
more
significant
than
anything
else
was
the
fact
that
satsuma
geishiû
and
tosa
were
guarding
the
imperial
palace
in
the
place
of
aidzu
there
was
some
talk
of
the
tycoon
intending
to
come
down
to
ozaka
and
boats
were
said
to
have
been
embargoed
at
yodo
to
convey
his
drilled
soldiers
down
the
river
that
the
object
of
the
was
not
to
fight
the
tycoon
but
only
to
extort
concessions
from
him
they
proposed
to
deprive
him
of
a
million
of
lands
as
a
punishment
for
the
transgressions
of
the
tokugawa
family
it
was
certain
endo
said
that
the
chôshiû
question
was
settled
and
that
the
guards
of
the
palace
had
been
changed
noguchi
story
was
that
aidzu
disgusted
with
the
tycoon
sent
in
his
written
resignation
but
that
it
was
intercepted
by
kuwana
the
tycoon
however
had
heard
of
aidzu
intention
of
which
he
informed
iga
no
kami
directly
after
the
return
of
the
latter
from
ozaka
and
sent
him
his
dismissal
then
the
three
clans
seized
the
environs
of
the
palace
the
thereupon
proceeded
to
the
palace
to
discuss
the
situation
but
the
tycoon
refused
to
attend
he
would
neither
fight
nor
take
any
decided
action
his
sole
aim
was
to
arrange
matters
peaceably
noguchi
evidently
was
reflecting
the
disposition
of
his
clan
ishikawa
kawachi
no
kami
gave
a
somewhat
different
account
but
it
was
clear
that
up
to
that
moment
there
had
been
no
disturbance
of
the
peace
the
nijô
a
nephew
of
the
tycoon
iyénari
who
died
in
aged
was
said
to
have
been
dismissed
and
either
konoyé
or
kujô
appointed
in
his
place
chôshiû
troops
had
entered
kiôto
on
january
ozaka
was
not
perturbed
by
the
events
that
had
passed
at
the
capital
and
on
the
i
was
able
to
give
an
entertainment
to
my
japanese
escort
at
a
restaurant
in
the
city
we
had
two
charming
to
attend
on
the
party
one
looking
as
if
she
had
just
stepped
out
of
a
picture
the
classical
contour
of
the
face
arched
nose
small
full
underlip
narrow
eyes
and
a
expression
of
countenance
the
other
personally
more
attractive
according
to
western
notions
of
beauty
but
with
a
little
of
the
devil
in
her
eyes
lastly
there
was
an
old
or
musician
of
six
or
eight
and
twenty
a
clever
woman
the
streets
were
still
illuminated
at
night
for
the
festival
and
crowded
with
dancers
on
the
the
mystery
was
cleared
up
by
ishikawa
who
came
to
tell
me
that
on
the
satsuma
had
proposed
to
abolish
not
only
the
tycoon
but
also
the
and
the
three
offices
intermediary
between
the
mikado
and
the
tycoon
the
new
administration
would
consist
of
which
sounded
like
secretaries
of
state
which
he
thought
meant
a
cabinet
and
thirdly
resembling
our
of
state
this
looked
rather
like
what
we
had
suggested
to
gotô
as
the
framework
of
the
future
executive
he
said
that
this
proposal
had
met
with
great
opposition
from
others
besides
the
who
were
afraid
that
the
extremists
might
go
further
and
abolish
the
mikado
i
endeavoured
to
reassure
him
on
this
point
it
is
not
he
continued
a
proposal
which
can
be
discussed
over
the
table
and
fighting
must
decide
it
seemed
from
his
account
that
the
tycoon
personally
did
not
object
but
his
followers
objected
for
him
while
he
seemed
willing
to
make
every
possible
sacrifice
in
order
to
secure
peace
but
it
was
not
quite
correct
the
sôsai
were
to
be
a
sort
of
partners
in
the
office
of
as
we
should
call
it
and
gijô
were
to
be
the
heads
of
administrative
departments
from
a
letter
of
january
to
my
mother
i
find
that
on
the
locock
mitford
and
willis
the
legation
doctor
and
i
were
to
have
gone
over
to
hiôgo
to
dine
with
the
admiral
whose
was
to
come
to
ozaka
to
fetch
us
so
we
went
down
to
the
foreign
settlement
and
having
no
other
resource
got
into
a
large
japanese
boat
managed
by
a
single
little
boy
with
a
paddle
at
first
we
proceeded
very
slowly
but
a
sailing
boat
gave
us
a
tow
after
which
we
shoved
off
and
had
to
depend
again
on
the
small
boy
it
was
bitterly
cold
with
a
wind
i
sat
in
the
bows
holding
up
a
railway
rug
with
my
teeth
two
of
the
others
protected
themselves
with
umbrellas
and
mitford
chinese
servant
the
faithful
hoisted
a
mat
on
a
pole
so
we
sailed
down
the
river
to
the
port
at
its
mouth
no
signs
were
to
be
seen
of
the
launch
so
we
tried
to
hire
a
japanese
boat
to
carry
us
across
the
bay
the
distance
being
only
eleven
miles
and
the
wind
fair
but
one
and
all
refused
on
account
of
the
gale
they
would
have
to
encounter
in
coming
back
so
we
were
compelled
to
put
our
luggage
into
a
boat
and
return
the
distance
from
the
fort
to
the
legation
was
about
seven
miles
and
a
half
but
it
took
us
several
hours
as
we
had
to
call
in
at
the
newly
established
in
the
foreign
settlement
we
dined
all
together
at
the
legation
the
chief
being
confined
to
his
room
with
a
sharp
attack
of
lumbago
which
had
not
however
prevented
his
making
a
formal
entry
into
ozaka
on
horseback
accompanied
by
the
mounted
escort
and
the
guard
of
fifty
infantry
detached
from
one
of
the
regiments
stationed
at
yokohama
by
january
all
was
over
with
the
tycoon
that
morning
moriyama
the
ancient
dutch
linguist
who
used
to
interpret
between
the
foreign
ministers
and
the
rôjiû
came
to
communicate
the
news
of
withdrawal
from
kiôto
at
first
i
feigned
to
suppose
that
he
was
coming
down
to
see
the
french
minister
not
at
all
he
is
coming
here
deprived
of
the
office
of
he
had
already
made
up
his
mind
to
do
this
four
or
five
days
before
but
was
persuaded
to
countermand
the
orders
given
for
his
departure
whereat
the
commissioners
for
foreign
affairs
stationed
at
ozaka
had
rejoiced
greatly
but
now
the
orders
had
been
repeated
and
would
be
carried
out
we
sauntered
out
to
look
at
the
preparations
made
for
his
arrival
small
bodies
of
drilled
troops
were
marching
about
headed
by
drummers
and
were
placed
so
as
to
sweep
the
narrow
streets
we
saw
men
in
all
sorts
of
military
costumes
with
their
heads
muffled
up
to
protect
them
from
the
cold
not
presenting
a
very
martial
appearance
we
went
on
to
the
restaurant
on
the
river
bank
where
in
the
spring
we
had
been
often
entertained
la
and
found
it
full
of
aidzu
men
whose
arms
were
piled
outside
there
was
a
inside
on
whom
i
paid
a
call
he
ascribed
the
tycoon
withdrawal
to
his
unwillingness
to
fight
under
the
walls
of
the
palace
and
described
the
leading
as
being
at
loggerheads
satsuma
desiring
to
carry
out
their
plans
by
main
force
and
tosa
preferring
to
rely
on
reason
but
their
objects
were
identical
it
was
not
kaga
but
tosa
that
was
endeavouring
to
negotiate
an
arrangement
between
satsuma
and
the
tycoon
he
talked
a
good
deal
about
forms
of
government
and
thought
that
gotô
plans
would
be
delightful
if
feasible
but
the
nation
was
not
yet
ripe
for
fundamental
changes
i
agreed
with
him
that
representative
government
would
be
a
curious
substitute
for
the
despotic
form
of
authority
that
had
existed
hitherto
mitford
and
i
went
out
again
about
two
to
have
another
look
at
the
preparations
and
wandered
over
the
bridge
on
to
the
kiôto
road
here
it
was
evident
that
the
tycoon
was
expected
to
arrive
at
any
moment
there
were
wonderful
groups
of
men
in
armour
wearing
surcoats
of
various
gay
colours
armed
with
spears
and
helmets
here
we
found
kubota
sentarô
the
commander
of
the
tycoon
drilled
troops
with
a
couple
of
colleagues
one
of
whom
told
mitford
in
bad
japanese
that
they
were
very
brave
and
intended
to
die
i
whispered
to
kubota
that
a
brave
man
did
not
retreat
in
this
fashion
he
repeated
the
explanation
of
the
tycoon
objection
to
fighting
at
the
steps
of
the
throne
and
perhaps
endangering
the
person
of
the
mikado
i
replied
that
he
should
not
have
given
up
the
guard
of
the
palace
kubota
alleged
the
mikado
orders
i
suggested
that
if
the
mikado
ordered
that
there
should
be
no
fighting
that
order
must
be
obeyed
the
significant
rejoinder
was
yes
by
the
tycoon
but
not
by
his
retainers
we
had
just
got
to
the
end
of
the
street
that
ran
by
the
castle
moat
when
the
bugles
sounded
to
arms
and
we
saw
a
long
train
of
drilled
troops
advancing
we
stood
on
one
side
opposite
to
a
man
wearing
a
gorgeous
red
surcoat
till
the
troops
should
pass
on
they
went
followed
by
a
herd
of
men
in
fantastic
costumes
brave
fighting
men
some
wearing
helmets
with
long
wigs
of
black
or
white
hair
reaching
down
their
backs
others
in
ordinary
helmets
flat
hats
armed
some
with
long
spears
short
spears
spencer
rifles
swiss
rifles
muskets
or
the
plain
two
swords
then
a
silence
came
over
the
scene
every
japanese
knelt
down
as
a
group
of
horsemen
approached
it
was
keiki
and
his
train
we
took
off
our
hats
to
fallen
greatness
he
was
muffled
in
a
black
hood
and
wore
an
ordinary
what
could
be
seen
of
his
countenance
looked
worn
and
sad
he
did
not
seem
to
notice
us
iga
no
kami
and
buzen
no
kami
members
of
his
council
who
came
next
on
the
contrary
nodded
gaily
to
our
salute
aidzu
and
kuwana
were
also
there
then
followed
other
and
the
procession
closed
with
more
drilled
troops
we
turned
round
with
the
last
of
these
and
hurried
on
to
see
the
entrance
into
the
castle
on
the
way
we
met
the
chief
who
had
come
out
to
have
a
look
at
the
tycoon
to
whose
downfall
he
had
contributed
as
far
as
lay
in
his
power
the
defiling
across
the
bridge
over
the
moat
was
an
effective
scheme
of
colour
and
the
procession
entered
by
the
great
gate
every
one
dismounted
except
the
tycoon
rain
fell
in
much
accordance
with
the
occasion
the
chief
insisted
much
against
my
own
feeling
in
sending
to
ask
for
an
interview
on
the
morrow
in
the
letter
i
sent
i
spoke
of
keiki
as
tycoon
denka
his
highness
the
tycoon
the
reply
which
came
back
styled
him
simply
uyésama
the
title
borne
by
the
head
of
the
tokugawa
family
before
his
formal
recognition
as
shôgun
by
the
mikado
court
endo
came
back
with
the
following
information
arisugawa
and
yamashina
both
princes
of
the
blood
ogimachi
and
iwakura
court
nobles
were
appointed
the
princes
of
owari
echizen
geishiû
satsuma
and
tosa
were
appointed
ohara
a
court
noble
and
various
others
were
to
be
besides
three
from
each
of
the
great
clans
satsuma
in
this
way
was
represented
by
iwashita
okubo
and
saigô
those
of
the
other
clans
were
not
known
to
him
the
titles
of
the
prince
of
chôshiû
and
his
son
had
been
restored
to
them
the
palace
was
guarded
by
satsuma
and
geishiû
chôshiû
troops
held
the
city
of
kiôto
a
satsuma
steamer
had
left
for
chikuzen
to
bring
back
the
five
court
nobles
who
had
fled
in
sanjô
afterwards
prime
minister
for
a
series
of
years
mibu
shijô
and
subsequently
minister
for
foreign
affairs
it
was
difficult
to
accuse
keiki
of
cowardice
no
one
had
ever
yet
expressed
such
an
opinion
of
him
and
the
probability
was
that
he
could
not
put
confidence
in
the
courage
of
his
troops
how
a
new
government
which
did
not
include
the
tokugawa
chief
could
hope
to
succeed
one
did
not
see
he
must
either
join
the
or
be
destroyed
perhaps
the
latter
alternative
was
what
his
adversaries
designed
keiki
had
declined
to
see
the
chief
on
the
following
day
and
it
looked
as
if
the
audience
would
have
to
be
deferred
the
policy
advocated
in
the
translated
from
my
articles
in
the
japan
times
seemed
to
govern
the
situation
the
opening
of
yedo
to
foreign
trade
must
evidently
be
postponed
as
locock
had
declined
the
responsibility
of
superintending
the
execution
of
the
arrangements
on
the
morning
of
january
the
chief
became
very
impatient
and
about
noon
ordered
me
to
prepare
a
note
to
the
effect
that
locock
and
i
should
go
to
the
castle
and
arrange
for
an
audience
its
despatch
was
delayed
by
a
private
note
from
koba
dennai
asking
me
to
name
an
hour
for
an
interview
with
him
at
three
our
note
was
to
have
gone
in
when
in
came
tsukahara
and
ishikawa
to
inform
us
that
the
french
minister
was
to
see
the
tycoon
as
we
still
called
him
at
once
and
that
keiki
could
receive
sir
harry
at
any
hour
he
chose
to
name
on
hearing
that
he
had
been
outstripped
by
his
colleague
his
wrath
was
unbounded
he
claimed
priority
on
the
ground
of
superior
diplomatic
rank
and
ordered
out
the
escort
we
proceeded
to
the
castle
in
pouring
rain
i
was
a
little
behind
the
others
and
entered
the
audience
chamber
just
as
roches
and
sir
harry
were
exchanging
words
about
what
the
former
stigmatized
as
a
breach
of
in
interrupting
his
interview
but
he
got
as
good
as
he
gave
and
the
audience
then
proceeded
after
aidzu
and
kuwana
had
been
presented
and
ordered
to
retire
aidzu
was
a
man
with
a
hooked
nose
about
years
old
of
middle
stature
and
thin
kuwana
an
ugly
young
person
apparently
years
of
age
and
of
dwarfish
proportions
the
old
fox
hirayama
sat
behind
the
uyésama
and
took
notes
shiwoda
samurô
who
spoke
french
well
interpreted
for
roches
and
i
for
sir
harry
simultaneously
the
words
which
fell
from
keiki
lips
he
gave
but
a
lame
account
of
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
professing
at
one
moment
to
have
withdrawn
his
troops
from
the
palace
in
accordance
with
an
imperial
order
while
refusing
to
recognize
another
such
order
which
he
felt
was
equally
dictated
by
satsuma
perhaps
this
was
natural
on
his
part
for
it
abolished
his
office
and
forbade
him
access
to
the
palace
he
had
had
it
hinted
to
him
that
he
should
also
resign
his
rank
of
naidaijin
and
offer
to
surrender
two
million
of
lands
but
he
had
resolved
not
to
heed
the
suggestion
on
the
ground
that
this
property
belonged
to
him
apart
from
his
office
just
as
much
as
the
lands
of
chôshiû
satsuma
and
the
other
belonged
to
them
he
appeared
to
feel
that
the
had
stolen
a
march
on
him
by
preparing
their
plans
beforehand
instead
of
proceeding
with
the
general
congress
of
princes
at
which
each
should
be
free
to
speak
his
own
mind
in
other
words
he
was
vexed
at
having
been
taken
in
by
a
stratagem
that
the
proposal
of
a
congress
was
merely
intended
to
throw
dust
in
his
eyes
was
pretty
evident
he
explained
the
order
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
aidzu
palace
guard
by
saying
that
other
amongst
them
satsuma
and
geishiû
held
some
of
the
gates
under
aidzu
and
that
they
introduced
certain
proscribed
court
nobles
into
the
precincts
after
the
and
other
dignitaries
had
retired
for
the
day
on
the
morning
of
january
and
that
at
noon
the
same
day
these
persons
issued
the
proclamation
setting
up
the
new
government
this
he
said
was
a
preconcocted
matter
they
had
it
all
ready
on
paper
and
took
these
measures
without
consulting
anyone
at
one
time
he
seemed
to
say
that
the
five
great
were
divided
among
themselves
at
another
he
spoke
of
the
decrees
as
having
been
agreed
to
by
them
all
beforehand
after
finishing
his
account
he
asked
the
opinion
of
the
two
ministers
both
expressed
admiration
of
his
patriotism
in
surrendering
power
and
the
justice
of
his
desire
to
settle
all
questions
by
a
general
congress
roches
in
very
flattering
terms
sir
harry
more
moderately
asking
also
some
pertinent
questions
which
were
answered
without
much
frankness
keiki
gave
as
his
reason
for
coming
down
to
ozaka
his
fear
lest
a
tumult
should
arise
in
the
vicinity
of
the
palace
and
his
desire
to
appease
the
indignation
of
his
followers
it
was
his
intention
to
remain
at
ozaka
but
could
not
say
whether
the
opposite
party
would
attack
him
there
to
another
question
as
to
the
form
of
government
that
had
been
set
up
at
kiôto
he
replied
that
the
mikado
ruled
nominally
but
that
kiôto
was
occupied
by
a
set
of
men
who
did
nothing
but
quarrel
among
themselves
anything
but
govern
yet
he
did
not
appear
to
claim
that
he
himself
possessed
any
authority
and
he
did
not
know
whether
the
other
would
rally
to
his
support
some
of
those
who
were
at
kiôto
had
been
disgusted
at
the
congress
not
having
come
into
existence
and
had
returned
to
their
homes
others
who
were
confounded
by
the
audacity
of
the
five
still
remained
there
our
inference
of
course
was
that
they
were
not
of
his
party
the
uyésama
finally
said
he
was
tired
and
so
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
one
could
not
but
pity
him
so
changed
as
he
was
from
the
proud
handsome
man
of
last
may
now
he
looked
thin
and
worn
and
his
voice
had
a
sad
tone
he
said
he
would
see
the
ministers
again
in
order
to
consult
with
them
the
commissioners
for
foreign
affairs
gave
us
a
paper
announcing
keiki
resignation
of
the
office
of
shôgun
and
the
change
of
his
title
back
to
uyésama
it
turned
out
that
what
koba
wanted
was
to
ask
whether
i
could
tell
him
what
the
uyésama
plans
were
was
he
returning
to
yedo
in
order
to
gather
his
forces
together
or
remaining
at
ozaka
with
the
intention
of
undertaking
a
ruffianly
expedition
to
the
capital
i
sent
back
a
reply
by
itô
that
i
knew
nothing
of
keiki
intended
movements
to
suppose
that
i
would
supply
information
on
such
points
showed
great
simplicity
the
diplomatic
body
being
intent
on
the
observation
of
neutrality
between
the
contending
parties
held
a
meeting
on
the
morning
of
january
at
the
prussian
legation
to
frame
a
declaration
and
a
request
to
be
informed
where
the
government
was
being
carried
on
the
french
minister
did
his
best
to
make
the
former
a
declaration
of
with
the
shiwoda
his
interpreter
and
i
had
to
translate
it
into
japanese
which
we
did
separately
his
version
was
very
literal
and
he
rendered
divers
partis
by
a
term
which
could
only
be
applied
to
conspirators
i
also
wished
the
translation
to
be
in
free
japanese
not
adhering
slavishly
to
the
wording
of
the
original
and
we
had
a
quarrel
over
this
point
after
shiwoda
left
me
ishikawa
came
in
to
whom
i
showed
my
version
in
order
that
whatever
were
the
result
no
doubt
should
be
possible
as
to
the
attitude
of
the
british
legation
up
to
a
late
hour
at
night
nothing
was
settled
except
that
the
interview
with
the
uyésama
which
was
to
have
been
immediate
was
put
off
on
the
following
morning
after
the
two
translations
had
been
compared
the
chief
suggested
an
alteration
in
the
french
original
which
removed
the
cause
of
dispute
then
locock
and
i
went
round
to
the
other
ministers
and
got
them
to
accept
my
translation
while
we
were
at
the
french
legation
hirayama
and
kawakatsu
came
in
and
they
took
the
paper
away
with
them
to
prepare
the
uyésama
reply
a
difference
had
arisen
between
roches
and
sir
harry
as
to
relative
precedence
the
former
was
only
minister
plenipotentiary
while
our
chief
was
envoy
extraordinary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
according
to
all
rules
he
was
senior
but
the
other
ministers
held
that
roches
having
arrived
first
in
japan
had
precedence
this
decision
did
away
with
sir
harry
claim
to
be
and
his
reason
for
asserting
a
right
to
have
audience
before
any
of
his
colleagues
the
latter
pretension
was
of
course
one
that
could
in
no
circumstances
be
upheld
at
three
the
whole
diplomatic
body
assembled
at
the
castle
in
the
all
the
other
apartments
being
occupied
by
aidzu
kuwana
and
kishiû
the
same
ceremony
was
observed
as
at
an
european
court
behind
the
uyésama
stood
his
pages
at
his
left
aidzu
kuwana
makino
bitchiû
no
kami
matsudaira
buzen
no
kami
two
councillors
of
state
and
a
noble
person
whom
i
took
to
be
ogaki
then
hirayama
and
tsukahara
on
his
right
were
a
number
of
in
japan
as
in
china
the
left
was
the
position
of
honour
close
to
his
highness
stood
iga
no
kami
on
whom
devolved
the
task
of
reading
the
translation
of
the
diplomatic
body
address
the
reply
was
a
very
long
one
spoken
by
the
uyésama
himself
he
began
by
explaining
his
policy
vindicating
his
retirement
from
kiôto
and
expressing
his
determination
to
abide
by
the
decisions
of
a
general
council
his
reply
to
the
particular
question
asked
by
the
ministers
was
that
foreigners
should
not
trouble
themselves
about
the
internal
affairs
of
japan
and
that
until
the
form
of
government
was
settled
he
regarded
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
as
his
own
function
the
commissioners
for
foreign
affairs
who
were
probably
apprehensive
that
they
might
become
nonentities
were
obviously
relieved
they
became
joyful
and
somewhat
triumphant
the
audience
was
over
in
an
hour
and
a
half
after
the
delivery
of
his
speech
the
uyésama
went
round
the
row
of
foreign
ministers
and
spoke
a
few
words
to
each
to
sir
harry
he
said
that
he
hoped
for
a
continuation
of
his
friendship
and
for
his
assistance
in
organizing
the
japanese
navy
the
chief
replied
in
florid
style
that
his
heart
was
the
same
as
it
had
ever
been
towards
him
and
that
he
trusted
the
sun
shining
through
the
windows
was
an
omen
of
his
future
a
metaphor
which
i
found
some
difficulty
in
putting
into
japanese
however
the
uyésama
pretended
to
take
it
all
in
one
of
the
private
secretaries
tsumagi
nakadzukasa
came
in
the
evening
to
assist
me
in
translating
the
answer
into
english
from
kuroda
shinyémon
i
received
the
correct
text
of
the
kiôto
decrees
he
told
me
that
the
were
unanimously
awaiting
keiki
reply
to
the
demand
for
two
million
of
lands
and
the
surrender
of
a
step
in
court
rank
they
expected
to
be
joined
by
the
other
western
and
also
by
the
northern
ones
i
advised
that
they
should
not
fight
if
they
could
help
it
but
if
they
judged
it
necessary
to
do
it
at
once
he
nodded
assent
it
was
intended
that
in
three
or
four
days
the
would
declare
their
intentions
to
the
foreign
ministers
it
showed
i
thought
a
good
deal
of
courage
on
the
part
of
a
satsuma
man
to
come
all
the
way
past
the
castle
sentries
to
our
legation
and
to
spare
him
this
risky
proceeding
i
promised
to
go
and
see
him
at
his
own
quarters
ishikawa
brought
me
a
document
purporting
to
be
a
protest
of
the
retainers
of
awa
hizen
higo
chikuzen
and
other
great
against
the
violent
proceedings
of
the
satsuma
party
and
insisting
on
the
convocation
of
a
general
council
as
far
as
could
be
inferred
from
their
language
it
did
not
appear
that
war
was
contemplated
by
either
party
we
heard
that
in
a
day
or
two
owari
echizen
and
the
court
noble
iwakura
would
come
down
to
receive
the
tokugawa
answer
to
the
demands
already
mentioned
the
troops
of
sakai
uta
no
kami
of
obama
in
wakasa
a
powerful
adherent
of
the
uyésama
had
been
sent
to
nishinomiya
where
there
were
probably
satsuma
and
chôshiû
troops
endo
however
was
of
opinion
that
war
would
certainly
break
out
he
said
that
a
hundred
of
satsuma
people
arrived
from
kiôto
last
night
to
escort
thither
the
five
court
nobles
who
had
been
recalled
from
exile
on
the
i
went
to
see
kuroda
shinyémon
and
koba
dennai
and
gave
them
copies
of
the
address
of
the
foreign
diplomatic
representatives
to
the
tycoon
as
well
as
of
his
reply
they
acknowledged
the
authenticity
of
the
protest
of
awa
and
the
other
eleven
clans
and
said
that
there
were
others
who
had
disapproved
of
his
restoring
the
sovereign
power
to
the
mikado
from
this
it
was
evident
to
me
that
the
reason
why
the
five
clans
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
act
was
that
they
wanted
to
carry
out
their
plans
before
the
others
arrived
kaga
was
said
to
have
left
kiôto
in
order
to
muster
his
forces
for
the
assistance
of
keiki
it
now
became
evident
that
the
tokugawa
party
were
preparing
for
war
kishiû
men
were
at
tennôji
sumiyoshi
and
kidzu
close
to
ozaka
aidzu
had
occupied
the
castle
of
yodo
a
few
miles
south
of
kiôto
on
the
direct
road
with
of
his
own
troops
and
of
the
a
recently
raised
body
of
tokugawa
infantry
had
also
proceeded
thither
while
all
along
the
road
small
detachments
were
stationed
owari
echizen
and
iwakura
were
expected
on
the
january
but
it
was
possible
that
the
five
clans
might
march
on
ozaka
before
that
date
koba
dennai
invited
us
to
the
satsuma
on
the
so
mitford
and
i
went
there
and
there
we
met
terashima
tôzô
formerly
known
as
matsugi
kôan
who
had
arrived
from
kiôto
that
morning
he
explained
that
it
was
thought
better
to
delay
issuing
the
mikado
announcement
to
foreign
countries
of
his
having
assumed
the
government
until
the
question
of
a
surrender
of
territory
by
the
late
tycoon
which
owari
and
echizen
had
undertaken
to
arrange
should
be
settled
it
must
be
understood
that
in
conversation
with
japanese
this
title
was
never
employed
as
it
was
only
invented
for
foreign
use
either
tokugawa
or
the
was
the
term
we
employed
it
had
been
originally
proposed
that
only
aidzu
and
kuwana
should
come
down
to
ozaka
in
order
to
return
by
sea
to
their
respective
countries
but
as
they
were
unwilling
to
come
alone
keiki
was
allowed
to
accompany
them
the
territory
to
be
surrendered
by
him
was
to
form
the
nucleus
of
a
national
treasury
and
it
had
been
proposed
by
tosa
and
some
other
clans
that
each
should
sacrifice
a
smaller
proportion
for
the
same
purpose
but
satsuma
objected
to
this
latter
part
of
the
scheme
the
mikado
notification
would
be
in
archaic
japanese
stating
that
he
was
the
head
of
the
confederated
that
he
alone
was
the
sovereign
of
japan
that
the
office
of
shôgun
was
abolished
that
the
government
was
entrusted
to
a
general
council
of
subject
to
his
supervision
and
lastly
that
the
treaties
were
to
be
remodelled
in
his
name
we
quite
agreed
with
him
that
to
issue
the
announcement
in
the
present
undecided
state
of
affairs
would
be
premature
a
civil
governor
had
been
appointed
for
kiôto
and
a
night
patrol
to
arrest
marauders
and
disturbers
of
the
public
peace
of
course
keiki
plan
of
calling
a
general
council
of
to
deliberate
on
the
state
of
the
country
was
put
forward
because
he
was
certain
of
securing
a
majority
by
the
aid
of
those
of
them
who
were
his
own
vassals
and
that
he
would
get
a
vote
carried
in
favour
of
reinstating
him
in
his
previous
position
of
authority
this
stratagem
had
been
defeated
by
the
bold
stroke
of
satsuma
getting
possession
of
the
mikado
person
this
was
stated
in
reply
to
a
question
about
the
court
language
when
the
document
eventually
was
delivered
it
was
found
as
far
as
my
memory
serves
me
to
be
framed
in
classical
chinese
next
day
sir
harry
paid
a
visit
to
the
castle
with
the
object
of
pumping
the
uyésama
about
his
plans
for
the
general
council
and
the
new
form
of
government
but
he
was
anticipated
by
inquiries
about
the
british
constitution
which
took
up
all
the
time
available
and
he
was
only
able
to
get
in
a
question
or
two
at
the
end
these
the
uyésama
adroitly
parried
by
saying
that
the
events
he
narrated
on
the
last
occasion
of
their
meeting
had
upset
all
his
arrangements
the
escort
was
ordered
and
we
were
obliged
to
leave
as
we
were
going
aidzu
came
up
and
saluted
the
chief
with
great
cordiality
who
replied
that
he
was
very
fond
of
making
the
acquaintance
of
and
already
knew
several
he
hoped
to
know
more
of
them
could
the
prince
of
aidzu
tell
him
whether
the
prince
of
awa
was
at
kiôto
or
ozaka
aidzu
replied
that
he
did
not
know
the
chief
rejoined
that
last
year
he
had
been
to
place
and
had
been
very
civilly
treated
this
rather
broad
hint
however
produced
no
effect
the
same
day
there
came
to
see
me
a
young
tosa
man
of
kishiû
origin
named
mutsu
yônosuké
with
whom
i
discussed
the
question
of
the
recognition
of
the
mikado
government
by
the
foreign
ministers
i
explained
that
it
was
not
for
the
foreign
representative
to
take
the
first
step
we
had
received
assurances
from
the
tokugawa
chief
that
he
would
continue
to
carry
on
the
administration
and
as
no
communication
had
yet
come
from
the
kiôto
side
we
had
to
go
on
holding
official
relations
with
him
if
the
kiôto
government
wished
to
assume
the
direction
of
affairs
they
should
inform
the
that
they
were
going
to
notify
their
assumption
of
foreign
affairs
to
the
ministers
and
then
invite
the
latter
to
kiôto
this
would
be
to
all
the
world
a
clear
proof
of
the
position
held
by
the
mikado
mutsu
replied
that
he
had
not
come
as
a
messenger
from
gotô
but
was
merely
giving
his
individual
views
he
thought
a
prince
of
the
blood
should
come
down
to
ozaka
and
hold
an
interview
at
the
castle
with
the
foreign
representatives
at
which
the
tokugawa
chief
should
attend
and
resign
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
on
which
the
prince
of
the
blood
would
deliver
the
mikado
declaration
of
policy
of
course
he
would
be
escorted
by
and
their
troops
i
warmly
approved
his
suggestion
and
at
his
request
promised
not
to
divulge
it
to
anyone
the
next
day
mitford
and
i
went
again
to
the
satsuma
and
found
that
a
list
of
questions
to
be
put
to
us
had
been
sent
down
from
kiôto
we
gave
one
answer
to
everything
namely
that
it
was
only
necessary
for
the
mikado
to
invite
the
ministers
to
kiôto
and
compel
the
to
abandon
his
claim
to
conduct
the
foreign
affairs
of
the
country
they
proposed
to
make
keiki
withdraw
his
answer
of
the
i
gave
them
copies
of
sir
harry
note
conveying
the
queen
condolences
on
the
death
of
the
late
mikado
and
of
itakura
reply
but
they
were
not
able
to
say
whether
the
note
had
been
communicated
to
the
court
the
of
higo
had
arrived
and
proceeded
to
kiôto
bizen
was
to
garrison
nishinomiya
the
five
exiled
court
nobles
were
expected
to
arrive
that
evening
and
would
go
up
to
kiôto
by
the
river
echizen
and
owari
came
down
from
kiôto
and
went
to
the
castle
as
had
been
announced
several
days
previously
the
former
sent
a
message
through
the
japanese
foreign
department
to
ask
when
his
retainers
might
come
to
see
our
guard
go
through
their
drill
we
replied
that
they
did
not
drill
perhaps
they
had
heard
of
the
mounted
escort
being
exhibited
to
the
tycoon
on
some
previous
occasion
we
should
have
preferred
to
have
this
request
made
to
us
direct
on
the
ishikawa
came
to
tell
us
that
our
japanese
guard
was
to
be
increased
by
one
hundred
men
in
consequence
of
disturbances
that
had
occurred
at
yedo
on
the
night
of
the
he
said
some
satsuma
men
had
attacked
the
shiba
barracks
of
sakai
saemon
no
jô
of
shônai
in
the
north
but
were
beaten
off
on
the
next
day
but
one
sakai
people
went
together
with
some
troops
which
they
had
borrowed
from
the
government
intending
to
demand
the
surrender
of
the
men
concerned
in
the
violence
of
the
but
before
they
reached
the
satsuma
fire
was
opened
on
them
with
field
pieces
and
small
arms
to
which
they
replied
in
the
end
the
was
burnt
to
the
ground
some
of
the
defenders
were
killed
others
captured
and
some
escaped
to
a
satsuma
war
vessel
that
was
lying
in
the
bay
this
at
once
attacked
a
government
ship
but
the
result
of
the
fight
was
unknown
at
any
rate
the
other
of
satsuma
and
of
shimadzu
awaji
no
kami
had
also
been
burnt
it
was
possible
that
the
satsuma
people
who
had
escaped
might
try
to
revenge
themselves
by
creating
disturbances
at
ozaka
though
it
was
not
likely
that
they
would
attack
the
castle
it
was
thought
desirable
as
a
measure
of
precaution
to
station
some
troops
where
we
were
the
chief
answer
was
that
they
must
first
write
all
this
officially
to
him
and
await
his
reply
before
sending
a
single
man
to
the
legation
to
alarm
us
still
further
ishikawa
told
us
a
story
of
boatmen
having
reported
that
the
student
interpreters
we
had
left
at
yedo
had
been
fired
at
from
the
satsuma
in
the
street
called
tamachi
the
date
of
the
letter
which
brought
this
news
being
january
as
this
was
two
days
before
the
satsuma
attack
on
the
sakai
we
did
not
give
credit
to
his
tale
what
we
thought
was
that
keiki
had
returned
a
refusal
to
the
ultimatum
of
the
and
feared
they
would
attack
him
at
ozaka
echizen
and
owari
returned
to
kiôto
that
day
but
we
did
not
hear
what
had
been
the
result
of
their
mission
on
the
the
admiral
arrived
with
news
from
yedo
confirming
all
that
ishikawa
had
reported
his
account
of
it
was
that
on
the
night
of
the
the
satsuma
people
had
contrived
to
set
a
part
of
the
castle
on
fire
and
carried
off
sama
a
princess
of
theirs
who
had
married
the
last
tycoon
but
one
thereupon
the
government
people
attacked
all
the
satsuma
in
yedo
and
burnt
them
and
the
occupants
getting
on
board
their
steamer
put
to
sea
in
the
meanwhile
the
eagle
and
other
government
vessels
received
orders
to
get
up
steam
and
attack
her
a
sea
fight
ensued
which
ended
by
the
eagle
and
the
satsuma
steamer
disappearing
in
the
offing
the
former
was
met
by
rodney
the
admiral
flagship
returning
next
day
with
her
gone
and
the
latter
was
seen
off
cape
oshima
south
of
the
province
of
kishiû
on
the
the
story
that
our
student
interpreters
quin
and
hodges
had
been
fired
at
about
the
as
they
were
passing
in
front
of
the
satsuma
battery
in
a
japanese
boat
was
true
but
no
harm
was
done
chapter
xxv
hostilities
begun
at
fushimi
on
the
evening
of
the
a
great
blaze
was
seen
in
the
direction
of
kiôto
endo
said
it
was
at
fushimi
three
miles
from
the
capital
and
that
the
troops
and
those
of
satsuma
and
his
allies
were
fighting
there
the
government
ship
with
others
were
blockading
satsuma
vessels
at
hiôgo
on
the
preceding
day
a
couple
of
battalions
had
been
seen
parading
for
the
march
to
kiôto
and
were
probably
among
the
troops
engaged
at
fushimi
report
said
that
keiki
himself
would
take
the
field
in
a
few
days
willis
servant
the
faithful
sahei
who
passed
through
fushimi
the
same
day
saw
bodies
of
satsuma
men
waiting
about
in
the
streets
and
warming
themselves
at
fires
but
he
could
not
say
for
certain
whether
there
were
any
other
imperialists
with
them
a
little
on
the
nearer
side
of
fushimi
were
the
and
behind
them
large
bodies
of
infantry
all
apparently
eager
for
the
fray
during
the
succeeding
night
the
satsuma
on
the
canal
where
we
used
to
meet
our
friends
was
burnt
down
some
accounts
said
it
was
set
on
fire
by
the
occupants
before
they
stole
away
others
that
the
tokugawa
troops
sent
three
or
four
shells
into
it
and
so
caused
the
blaze
at
any
rate
the
satsuma
people
got
into
boats
and
went
down
the
river
pursued
by
the
tokugawa
men
who
fired
at
them
from
the
banks
and
killed
two
of
the
fugitives
sir
harry
went
to
call
on
itakura
who
told
us
that
the
town
of
fushimi
had
been
set
on
fire
by
satsuma
troops
who
were
opposing
the
entry
of
the
uyésama
forces
into
kiôto
fighting
began
at
four
and
the
result
was
not
yet
known
another
detachment
marching
up
the
toba
road
which
follows
the
right
bank
of
the
river
fell
into
an
ambuscade
and
was
forced
to
retire
he
could
not
tell
us
when
the
uyésama
would
start
the
troops
that
had
been
opposed
at
fushimi
were
his
advanced
guard
destined
to
occupy
the
castle
of
nijô
in
kiôto
as
he
was
returning
there
shortly
having
been
invited
to
do
so
by
echizen
and
owari
all
the
other
were
tired
of
the
arrogant
conduct
of
satsuma
probably
it
was
his
troops
alone
which
had
fought
at
fushimi
ishikawa
gave
me
a
copy
of
a
letter
from
the
commandant
at
fushimi
who
writing
to
tsukahara
and
buzen
no
kami
mentioned
that
guns
had
been
lent
for
the
destruction
of
the
satsuma
it
was
reported
that
tsukahara
had
disappeared
and
it
was
conjectured
that
he
had
been
shot
during
the
imperialist
attack
on
the
official
residence
of
the
governor
of
fushimi
but
we
could
not
ascertain
that
he
had
been
seen
farther
on
than
yodo
next
day
the
chief
went
to
itakura
house
just
inside
the
gate
near
our
legation
where
he
saw
nagai
gemba
no
kami
nagai
told
us
that
up
to
last
night
the
tokugawa
troops
had
been
repulsed
on
both
points
of
their
advance
and
were
going
to
try
another
road
the
takéda
kaidô
further
to
the
west
to
us
it
appeared
that
they
ought
to
have
done
better
as
they
were
to
they
reported
the
enemy
force
to
consist
of
satsuma
and
chôshiû
men
assisted
by
which
probably
meant
the
men
of
other
clans
but
the
remaining
appeared
to
be
preserving
a
neutral
attitude
the
was
takenaga
tango
no
kami
the
denunciation
of
satsuma
crimes
was
carried
by
the
advanced
guard
whom
gemba
no
kami
described
as
the
uyésama
retinue
he
still
maintained
that
the
uyésama
had
not
wished
to
have
recourse
to
arms
but
was
forced
into
it
against
his
will
still
gemba
no
kami
could
not
give
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
firing
on
the
satsuma
steamer
lotus
as
early
as
the
evening
of
january
the
same
evening
reports
came
in
that
the
tokugawa
troops
had
retired
miles
from
fushimi
and
had
destroyed
the
bridge
over
the
river
below
yodo
to
obstruct
the
further
advance
of
the
satsuma
forces
seven
of
wounded
had
come
down
the
river
from
what
we
heard
on
the
morning
of
the
it
appeared
that
the
prospects
of
the
tokugawa
party
were
not
very
encouraging
in
the
afternoon
great
fires
were
distinctly
visible
from
the
hill
by
the
castle
in
the
direction
of
hirakata
and
nashimoto
about
between
ozaka
and
fushimi
which
showed
that
the
battle
was
approaching
nearer
a
consultation
was
held
by
the
chief
with
the
legation
staff
the
result
of
which
was
that
we
were
to
hire
as
many
boats
as
possible
to
convey
the
archives
to
the
british
squadron
and
when
they
were
placed
in
safety
we
should
be
able
to
await
the
development
of
events
with
calmness
after
dinner
sir
harry
went
to
see
the
french
minister
and
returned
about
nine
with
information
that
a
circular
was
to
be
addressed
to
the
foreign
ministers
announcing
that
the
uyésama
could
no
longer
defend
them
and
they
must
take
their
own
measures
for
the
protection
of
their
flags
at
eleven
came
an
official
messenger
with
the
circular
who
promised
to
get
us
as
many
boats
as
possible
on
the
following
morning
to
move
our
baggage
and
after
packing
up
the
archives
we
went
to
bed
at
four
in
the
morning
locock
woke
me
with
the
news
that
a
note
had
come
from
the
french
minister
to
say
that
the
enemy
would
enter
the
city
early
in
the
day
and
that
we
must
run
off
at
daylight
with
what
we
could
carry
so
we
all
got
up
frightfully
cold
though
it
was
and
packed
up
our
belongings
no
boats
had
arrived
at
daylight
my
japanese
escort
came
to
say
that
with
the
greatest
difficulty
they
had
managed
to
procure
one
large
boat
on
this
the
archives
were
placed
and
started
off
about
nine
then
came
ishikawa
who
said
he
was
powerless
to
help
us
the
imperialists
had
not
yet
appeared
but
he
considered
it
advisable
for
us
to
get
off
at
once
so
sir
harry
and
i
went
off
with
him
to
look
for
the
porters
whom
we
met
outside
the
great
gate
of
the
castle
just
at
that
moment
we
saw
a
curious
procession
going
in
it
consisted
of
a
palanquin
like
a
one
of
those
gods
litters
carried
in
religious
pageants
a
large
umbrella
held
over
it
and
two
men
with
lanterns
on
long
poles
in
front
ishikawa
let
out
that
he
thought
it
was
conveying
a
messenger
from
the
mikado
he
and
i
came
back
with
the
porters
and
brought
the
greater
part
of
the
baggage
down
to
the
bank
of
the
stream
behind
the
legation
but
still
there
were
no
boats
so
we
went
off
to
the
governor
residence
and
tried
to
interest
the
officials
on
our
behalf
they
appeared
to
be
in
a
state
of
extreme
perturbation
and
declared
that
it
was
impossible
to
procure
any
boats
ishikawa
almost
shed
tears
and
vowed
that
he
would
never
again
try
to
get
boats
and
porters
for
the
legation
it
was
none
of
his
business
we
agreed
therefore
to
deposit
the
greater
part
of
the
baggage
inside
the
castle
luckily
however
this
proved
unnecessary
for
when
i
returned
to
our
quarters
i
found
the
chief
radiant
with
joy
five
boats
having
arrived
in
the
interval
about
ten
therefore
we
were
able
to
make
a
start
for
the
foreign
settlement
but
i
stayed
behind
with
the
six
men
of
my
japanese
escort
capital
fellows
who
had
stuck
to
me
ever
since
we
made
the
journey
overland
from
ozaka
to
yedo
in
i
had
to
procure
boats
for
my
own
baggage
which
by
an
oversight
had
been
left
behind
and
to
get
the
stores
removed
to
the
castle
however
more
boats
arrived
than
had
been
expected
so
i
put
all
the
baggage
on
board
including
even
a
huge
pot
of
unluckily
a
fine
gold
lacquer
cabinet
of
mitford
for
which
he
had
recently
paid
was
overlooked
about
noon
i
started
for
the
foreign
settlement
in
great
triumph
there
was
even
a
i
asked
a
man
whom
i
had
never
seen
before
for
whom
this
was
intended
and
was
greatly
flattered
when
he
replied
innocently
that
it
was
for
satow
sama
this
enabled
me
to
go
down
comfortably
instead
of
walking
the
whole
distance
on
the
way
we
all
nodded
and
dozed
for
we
had
had
no
proper
night
rest
from
time
to
time
we
were
challenged
by
the
posts
on
the
banks
but
no
attempt
was
made
to
stop
us
on
arriving
at
the
settlement
i
found
the
wind
was
blowing
too
strongly
from
the
west
to
allow
of
our
passing
the
bar
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
the
chief
locock
willis
and
wilkinson
were
all
fast
asleep
captain
bruce
commandant
of
the
infantry
guard
and
the
constable
had
gone
off
again
to
the
legation
to
endeavour
to
recover
the
remainder
of
our
property
that
had
been
left
behind
and
i
got
lieutenant
bradshaw
a
boat
with
the
same
object
towards
evening
they
returned
a
steam
launch
from
the
squadron
was
lying
off
the
settlement
and
the
legation
was
located
at
the
there
it
was
bitterly
cold
and
we
were
glad
to
get
to
bed
after
what
was
a
very
good
dinner
considering
the
circumstances
the
other
foreign
representatives
were
at
tempôzan
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
in
miserable
huts
and
with
very
little
to
eat
we
felt
pity
for
them
mingled
with
pride
when
we
compared
our
situation
with
theirs
rumours
were
flying
about
among
the
townspeople
that
keiki
had
been
declared
a
rebel
about
nine
on
the
following
morning
february
locock
and
i
took
an
escort
from
the
detachment
and
went
off
to
the
castle
to
see
what
was
the
state
of
things
there
in
front
of
it
there
was
a
great
crowd
and
all
the
gates
seemed
deserted
we
knocked
at
the
door
but
got
no
answer
a
clear
sign
that
he
and
his
people
had
taken
to
flight
the
crowd
laughed
we
sent
in
to
the
castle
by
one
of
my
japanese
escort
to
inquire
who
was
there
and
were
told
in
reply
that
keiki
had
departed
leaving
it
empty
we
went
on
to
the
legation
where
we
found
everything
just
as
we
had
left
it
we
got
back
by
noon
and
as
we
were
at
lunch
there
came
in
a
detachment
of
thirteen
frenchmen
who
in
return
for
being
stoned
by
the
crowd
had
fired
and
killed
some
eight
or
nine
people
this
was
looked
upon
as
a
wholesome
lesson
to
the
rabble
not
to
cry
out
abuse
of
foreigners
but
nevertheless
was
much
to
be
regretted
as
it
would
tend
to
make
the
foreign
colleagues
believe
ozaka
unsafe
for
themselves
during
our
walk
to
the
castle
and
back
we
had
observed
no
signs
of
hostility
a
fact
which
seemed
to
show
that
the
population
were
able
to
distinguish
between
nationalities
the
french
legation
had
been
pillaged
and
the
furniture
smashed
after
lunch
sir
harry
willis
and
i
went
down
to
tempôzan
the
chief
to
call
on
his
colleagues
willis
to
attend
to
the
wounds
of
some
aidzu
men
who
had
been
brought
down
from
kiôto
where
they
had
fought
against
the
imperialists
the
colleagues
were
furious
with
sir
harry
for
having
been
so
fortunate
as
to
save
all
his
baggage
and
archives
and
for
having
had
the
pluck
to
remain
four
miles
nearer
the
supposed
danger
than
they
had
a
rather
angry
discussion
ensued
sir
harry
declared
that
he
would
not
leave
ozaka
unless
he
was
able
to
carry
off
every
atom
of
legation
property
and
he
did
not
know
when
that
might
be
possible
they
on
the
contrary
said
that
having
struck
their
flags
it
was
their
intention
to
move
across
to
kôbé
hiôgo
and
await
the
course
of
events
i
went
to
make
friends
with
some
of
the
aidzu
wounded
who
were
waiting
for
boats
to
put
them
on
board
of
tokugawa
ships
they
asserted
that
they
would
have
beaten
the
enemy
if
they
had
been
properly
supported
but
tôdô
had
turned
traitor
at
yamazaki
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
nearly
opposite
yodo
which
was
the
most
important
point
of
the
defence
and
keiki
general
takénaga
had
gone
over
to
the
enemy
at
yodo
itself
moreover
the
drilled
infantry
were
useless
if
one
man
ran
the
rest
followed
like
a
flock
of
sheep
as
we
should
say
they
estimated
the
satsuma
force
at
the
low
figure
of
but
said
the
skirmishing
of
the
enemy
was
very
good
and
they
were
armed
with
keiki
had
run
away
they
knew
not
whither
but
probably
to
yedo
we
found
that
the
fort
at
tempôzan
and
one
a
little
further
up
the
river
which
had
hitherto
been
under
the
charge
of
kôriyama
a
kiûshiû
had
been
dismantled
the
guns
in
the
former
being
spiked
and
the
ammunition
embarked
in
the
tokugawa
warship
which
left
at
noon
keiki
was
believed
to
be
on
board
of
her
old
hirayama
was
in
the
fort
at
tempôzan
but
studiously
concealed
himself
chanoine
many
years
afterwards
for
a
brief
period
french
minister
of
war
and
another
officer
of
the
french
military
mission
had
arrived
the
previous
night
from
yedo
but
had
had
to
leave
again
greatly
disappointed
that
they
had
come
too
late
for
the
fair
obviously
it
had
been
intended
that
they
should
act
as
advisers
to
keiki
the
town
of
sakai
was
reported
to
have
been
burnt
and
also
the
houses
round
the
bridge
over
the
but
it
was
not
known
whether
by
accident
or
intentionally
no
satsuma
men
had
yet
entered
ozaka
the
french
minister
was
our
authority
for
a
story
that
keiki
on
finding
that
the
majority
of
the
were
arrayed
against
him
had
surrendered
the
castle
and
city
of
ozaka
to
echizen
and
owari
because
they
had
been
kind
and
polite
to
him
when
they
came
on
their
mission
from
the
court
the
aidzu
men
were
very
grateful
to
willis
for
the
assistance
he
gave
in
attending
their
wounded
and
apparently
regarded
the
english
as
the
best
and
kindest
people
in
the
world
it
was
resolved
by
sir
harry
that
he
should
go
to
hiôgo
in
order
to
avoid
a
quarrel
with
his
colleagues
and
i
volunteered
to
remain
at
ozaka
with
russell
robertson
as
acting
and
half
the
guard
from
the
under
the
command
of
bruce
so
that
the
honour
of
the
flag
might
be
maintained
it
was
certain
that
noguchi
and
my
japanese
escort
would
stand
by
me
and
we
were
determined
to
fight
to
the
last
if
we
should
be
attacked
but
that
i
did
not
anticipate
i
despatched
the
chôshiû
student
endo
to
urge
that
the
should
forthwith
make
their
declaration
of
policy
to
the
foreign
representatives
as
mitford
and
i
had
given
the
draft
of
a
notification
to
our
satsuma
friends
and
there
was
also
my
private
understanding
with
tosa
on
that
subject
the
aidzu
soldiers
at
the
fort
said
that
satsuma
men
had
been
found
in
the
castle
in
disguise
and
that
there
even
were
some
amongst
keiki
drilled
troops
cunning
devils
they
must
have
been
if
all
we
heard
was
true
accordingly
on
february
the
chief
went
away
to
hiôgo
to
arrange
for
rattler
to
convey
locock
to
yokohama
where
he
was
to
be
in
the
charge
of
the
legation
and
also
for
his
own
temporary
withdrawal
to
kôbé
about
eight
in
the
morning
we
saw
from
the
a
puff
of
white
smoke
ascend
in
the
direction
of
the
castle
followed
by
dense
clouds
of
black
smoke
the
report
soon
spread
that
the
castle
was
on
fire
and
so
it
was
in
fact
after
breakfast
locock
and
i
took
forty
of
the
guard
with
bruce
and
bradshaw
and
went
off
to
see
the
fire
and
find
out
whether
our
legation
had
been
burnt
we
marched
along
the
bank
of
the
river
to
the
kiôbashi
gate
of
the
castle
and
turning
in
there
found
that
the
granaries
and
the
inner
circle
had
been
set
on
fire
but
no
one
could
tell
us
by
whom
this
had
been
done
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
north
and
sparks
had
spread
the
conflagration
to
some
of
the
huts
previously
occupied
by
the
drilled
troops
on
the
south
side
we
walked
round
to
where
we
found
that
the
legation
buildings
were
being
plundered
by
people
of
the
lowest
class
we
pursued
some
of
them
but
were
not
in
time
to
put
an
end
to
the
devastation
all
the
furniture
had
been
destroyed
and
the
godown
sacked
unfortunately
this
contained
mitford
beautiful
which
had
no
doubt
been
carried
off
there
was
an
immense
crowd
in
front
of
the
castle
and
men
were
pouring
in
and
out
of
the
gates
but
they
offered
no
opposition
to
us
and
did
not
stone
us
as
we
might
have
expected
them
to
do
the
mob
had
of
course
destroyed
the
official
residence
of
the
governors
as
far
as
was
possible
we
got
back
to
the
about
and
found
there
endo
who
had
already
returned
from
his
mission
he
said
that
two
or
three
hundred
of
the
chôshiû
folk
were
already
in
the
castle
and
that
an
official
had
been
left
behind
to
hand
the
place
over
to
owari
but
the
flames
broke
out
before
the
ceremony
could
be
completed
whether
the
fire
was
started
by
the
rabble
or
by
keiki
followers
he
did
not
know
the
only
imperialists
who
had
yet
arrived
were
chôshiû
men
about
two
we
left
the
foreign
settlement
in
a
lifeboat
with
locock
and
wilkinson
who
were
to
be
embarked
on
board
rattler
and
proceed
to
yedo
halfway
down
the
river
we
met
the
with
two
other
large
boats
bringing
the
chief
and
captain
stanhope
of
ocean
who
seeing
what
they
took
to
be
a
general
conflagration
of
all
ozaka
had
come
to
take
us
away
and
haul
down
the
flag
how
angry
i
was
we
were
not
in
the
slightest
danger
either
of
being
attacked
by
the
victors
or
from
the
burning
of
the
castle
and
i
would
have
answered
with
my
life
for
the
safety
of
every
person
left
with
me
had
i
not
received
repeated
assurances
from
satsuma
tosa
and
chôshiû
that
our
legation
would
be
respected
however
there
was
no
help
for
it
orders
had
to
be
obeyed
we
found
great
difficulty
in
procuring
barges
and
had
to
send
the
out
to
seize
as
many
as
we
wanted
we
secured
three
into
which
we
packed
everything
including
the
furniture
the
archives
and
the
baggage
of
the
having
been
already
started
off
everything
was
got
away
by
six
and
we
eventually
crossed
the
bar
in
safety
the
in
which
i
was
grounded
three
times
and
finally
stuck
fast
but
captain
bullock
of
serpent
fetched
me
off
in
his
gig
willis
who
with
the
safe
containing
the
legation
funds
was
in
a
boat
towed
by
the
serpent
pinnace
did
not
get
on
board
till
midnight
then
she
took
all
the
barges
in
tow
and
steamed
over
to
hiôgo
next
morning
we
landed
there
and
got
the
baggage
on
shore
most
of
the
party
found
accommodation
at
the
consulate
i
took
possession
of
the
district
administrator
house
which
had
been
occupied
by
some
officers
the
caretaker
objected
i
insisted
however
that
as
we
had
been
turned
out
of
ozaka
by
the
we
had
the
best
right
in
the
world
to
the
abandoned
accommodation
of
the
officials
so
i
had
my
baggage
carried
in
and
set
up
house
there
our
chief
had
quartered
himself
at
the
consulate
and
the
other
five
foreign
representatives
french
dutch
american
and
italian
occupied
the
a
large
building
in
foreign
style
which
the
officials
would
otherwise
have
set
on
fire
to
prevent
it
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
victors
the
governor
an
old
acquaintance
of
ours
named
shibata
had
chartered
the
steamer
osaka
at
a
day
say
to
convey
himself
and
his
staff
back
to
yedo
whither
he
started
the
same
afternoon
satsuma
man
godai
i
learnt
had
gone
to
ozaka
the
previous
night
or
early
that
morning
in
order
to
assure
the
chief
that
he
might
safely
remain
there
but
of
course
he
came
too
late
the
next
thing
one
heard
was
that
it
had
been
intended
to
declare
keiki
a
rebel
if
he
did
not
withdraw
his
troops
from
ozaka
kiôto
and
other
points
between
the
two
cities
and
that
satsuma
geishiû
chôshiû
and
tosa
were
charged
with
the
duty
of
using
force
to
compel
obedience
if
he
refused
to
listen
to
the
advice
offered
to
him
by
echizen
and
owari
in
the
first
place
this
seemed
to
explain
his
hasty
flight
but
from
any
point
of
view
european
as
well
as
japanese
it
was
disgraceful
after
informing
the
diplomatic
representatives
that
he
regarded
himself
as
charged
with
the
direction
of
foreign
affairs
the
only
further
intimation
they
received
from
his
officials
was
that
he
could
no
longer
protect
the
legations
but
he
never
so
much
as
hinted
that
he
was
about
to
abscond
i
was
also
informed
that
it
was
intended
to
invite
the
ministers
to
kiôto
and
keiki
had
been
ordered
to
transmit
the
invitation
to
them
which
of
course
he
omitted
to
do
in
fact
the
policy
of
the
tokugawa
government
from
the
very
beginning
of
their
relations
with
the
outer
world
of
europe
had
been
to
keep
foreigners
from
coming
in
contact
with
the
kiôto
party
and
in
this
they
were
heartily
assisted
by
roches
the
french
minister
i
well
recollect
how
when
we
went
to
the
castle
to
see
keiki
after
his
retirement
from
kiôto
some
of
the
commissioners
for
foreign
affairs
jeered
at
me
saying
of
course
you
now
expect
to
get
to
kiôto
but
do
be
too
sure
or
words
to
that
effect
a
report
having
been
circulated
that
somebody
either
satsuma
or
tokugawa
people
were
going
to
blow
up
the
martello
tower
which
stood
at
the
end
of
the
dry
river
bed
between
hiôgo
and
kôbé
boats
were
sent
from
ocean
the
french
flagship
laplace
and
the
oneida
the
door
was
locked
and
the
key
taken
away
chapter
xxvi
the
bizen
affair
on
february
bizen
troops
were
passing
through
kôbé
from
the
early
morning
and
about
two
in
the
afternoon
the
retinue
of
one
of
their
shot
an
american
sailor
who
had
crossed
the
street
just
in
front
which
according
to
japanese
ideas
was
an
insult
that
deserved
mortal
chastisement
after
that
they
attempted
the
life
of
every
foreigner
whom
they
met
but
fortunately
without
any
serious
results
what
at
a
later
time
became
the
foreign
settlement
was
then
an
open
plain
at
the
upper
edge
of
it
ran
the
high
road
and
as
the
bizen
people
passed
along
they
suddenly
opened
fire
apparently
from
then
every
foreigner
was
seen
scurrying
across
the
plain
for
safety
the
american
marines
immediately
started
in
pursuit
our
guard
of
was
called
out
and
some
french
sailors
were
landed
half
of
our
guard
under
bruce
were
despatched
to
occupy
the
entrance
from
kôbé
into
the
foreign
quarter
and
the
other
half
followed
in
pursuit
on
reaching
the
at
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
plain
we
perceived
the
bizen
men
marching
in
close
column
about
or
yards
ahead
so
we
passed
through
the
gap
in
the
river
bank
and
opened
fire
there
were
at
least
civilians
with
us
all
armed
with
rifles
who
likewise
fired
willis
mitford
and
i
had
only
our
revolvers
at
the
first
volley
from
our
side
the
enemy
turned
into
a
field
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
fired
at
us
from
below
a
bank
on
our
returning
their
fire
they
all
took
to
flight
we
pursued
them
every
now
and
then
firing
at
one
or
other
who
had
failed
to
get
under
cover
but
finally
they
took
to
the
hills
and
disappeared
completely
sir
harry
followed
by
his
mounted
escort
of
galloped
some
distance
down
the
road
in
the
direction
of
nishinomiya
but
was
unable
to
catch
sight
of
the
foe
if
any
of
them
had
suffered
from
our
fire
he
must
have
been
carried
off
by
his
comrades
willis
found
an
old
peasant
woman
lying
by
a
bank
with
a
bullet
wound
through
both
ankles
whom
he
brought
back
and
cured
of
her
hurt
then
we
took
prisoner
a
wretched
porter
who
escaped
with
his
life
by
a
mere
miracle
for
at
least
fifteen
revolver
shots
were
fired
at
him
at
close
quarters
as
he
rose
from
his
place
of
concealment
without
his
receiving
a
single
wound
we
opened
the
baggage
which
had
been
dropped
by
the
fugitives
but
found
nothing
of
value
only
three
small
weapons
representing
a
cross
between
a
matchlock
and
a
howitzer
and
a
few
carpenters
tools
from
the
porter
whom
we
led
home
as
our
prisoner
we
ascertained
that
the
detachment
consisted
of
two
bizen
ikéda
isé
and
hiki
tatéwaki
who
were
on
their
way
with
about
men
to
reinforce
the
garrison
of
nishinomiya
and
that
some
of
them
had
remained
behind
at
hiôgo
on
returning
to
the
settlement
we
found
a
quantity
more
baggage
which
had
been
dropped
in
kôbé
by
the
men
whom
bruce
had
intercepted
sentries
were
then
posted
along
the
main
street
of
kôbé
as
far
as
the
first
barrier
gate
where
a
strong
guard
was
stationed
with
a
howitzer
a
line
of
sentries
was
also
drawn
round
the
north
and
east
sides
of
the
plain
from
some
of
these
who
were
americans
sailors
or
marines
an
alarm
was
raised
about
ten
great
alacrity
was
displayed
by
the
naval
people
field
pieces
were
landed
and
numbers
of
men
after
all
no
enemy
made
his
appearance
to
justify
so
great
a
stir
being
made
i
proposed
to
sir
harry
that
we
should
issue
a
manifesto
declaring
that
if
bizen
people
did
not
satisfactorily
explain
their
behaviour
the
foreign
powers
would
make
it
a
quarrel
with
japan
as
a
whole
he
induced
his
colleagues
to
agree
to
this
and
i
started
our
prisoner
back
to
his
people
with
a
copy
though
i
did
not
feel
much
confidence
in
its
reaching
its
destination
about
one
a
hundred
chôshiû
men
sent
down
for
the
protection
of
kôbé
and
hiôgo
against
tokugawa
troops
arrived
just
outside
our
post
in
the
middle
of
the
village
and
were
within
an
ace
of
being
fired
on
by
our
guard
luckily
i
came
up
at
the
moment
and
went
to
an
inn
at
which
they
had
billeted
their
rank
and
file
to
arrange
that
they
should
withdraw
which
they
did
very
readily
during
the
afternoon
four
steamers
belonging
to
chikuzen
kurumé
uwajima
and
one
it
was
thought
to
the
tokugawa
were
seized
at
kiôgo
and
kôbé
to
hold
as
a
material
guarantee
the
morning
of
february
brought
me
again
an
invitation
from
yoshii
to
visit
him
at
ozaka
and
talk
over
affairs
but
it
was
impossible
for
i
had
too
much
on
my
hands
the
whampoa
a
steamer
belonging
to
glover
of
nagasaki
had
arrived
and
a
rumour
was
invented
and
spread
that
she
was
conveying
satsuma
troops
so
i
was
sent
off
in
a
boat
to
stop
their
landing
there
was
not
a
single
satsuma
man
on
board
some
men
of
awa
in
shikoku
had
decamped
in
boats
from
hiôgo
and
our
people
pursued
them
but
as
they
were
only
a
few
in
number
and
very
miserable
in
appearance
they
were
not
molested
we
then
issued
proclamations
with
the
wording
of
which
i
was
entrusted
explaining
why
we
had
seized
the
steamers
a
second
exhorting
the
people
to
go
quietly
about
their
business
and
a
third
announcing
that
all
unarmed
persons
would
be
allowed
to
pass
our
posts
about
one
a
dutchman
appropriately
enough
in
accordance
with
popular
notions
raised
an
alarm
that
the
japanese
were
advancing
to
the
attack
the
report
spread
as
far
as
the
quarters
of
the
foreign
representatives
at
the
where
von
brandt
was
making
a
great
fuss
about
a
body
of
at
least
three
hundred
armed
men
that
he
asserted
were
menacing
kôbé
from
the
hills
close
by
on
the
north
side
i
had
a
look
at
them
through
his
glass
and
certainly
saw
men
but
if
they
were
armed
i
was
sure
they
were
friendly
chôshiû
men
so
i
got
leave
to
take
lieutenant
gurdon
of
ocean
with
ten
men
and
we
started
out
to
explore
and
to
paste
up
our
proclamations
wherever
we
found
one
of
chôshiû
the
only
people
on
the
hills
turned
out
to
be
peasants
the
chôshiû
troops
were
billeted
at
shôfukuji
a
large
temple
or
buddhist
monastery
about
two
miles
away
among
the
hills
so
it
was
manifest
that
they
were
keeping
their
engagement
to
us
we
marched
through
hiôgo
and
pasted
a
copy
of
our
first
notification
on
the
door
of
the
bizen
official
hotel
and
the
whole
series
of
four
on
the
house
where
their
troops
had
passed
the
night
of
the
having
accomplished
all
this
we
returned
to
relieve
the
anxiety
of
our
fellow
foreigners
just
as
i
got
back
i
met
yoshii
and
terashima
who
had
come
down
to
have
a
talk
the
chief
gave
them
a
short
interview
at
which
he
advised
them
to
send
off
at
once
and
get
the
mikado
messengers
to
come
down
with
their
notification
to
the
foreign
representatives
they
wanted
him
to
let
satsuma
troops
pass
through
our
lines
but
he
refused
on
the
ground
that
as
we
did
not
know
anything
officially
from
the
mikado
we
could
not
recognize
satsuma
as
acting
under
his
majesty
orders
so
they
agreed
to
bring
their
men
into
hiôgo
by
another
route
then
i
went
off
with
them
to
their
at
hiôgo
and
they
told
me
a
good
deal
about
the
course
of
recent
events
theirs
had
been
a
continuous
course
of
victory
from
the
very
first
for
being
like
rats
in
a
bag
they
had
to
fight
hard
for
their
lives
and
were
compelled
to
be
victorious
at
fushimi
they
had
had
a
desperate
fight
but
after
that
they
pressed
on
and
drove
the
tokugawa
forces
into
yodo
this
place
as
well
as
the
long
bridge
over
the
river
was
fired
by
the
retreating
troops
aidzu
men
fought
very
bravely
the
plan
of
the
was
to
get
the
satsuma
and
chôshiû
soldiers
engaged
with
aidzu
and
the
a
body
of
armed
recently
raised
and
then
to
creep
round
to
the
imperialist
right
with
the
drilled
infantry
and
seize
kiôto
higo
too
was
only
waiting
for
signs
that
satsuma
was
getting
the
worst
of
it
in
order
to
seize
the
palace
but
now
he
was
very
humble
the
number
of
satsuma
and
chôshiû
men
actually
engaged
was
about
the
remainder
being
employed
in
the
defence
of
the
city
anyhow
as
the
roads
to
be
held
were
very
narrow
large
bodies
could
not
have
been
employed
to
any
advantage
they
loaded
their
with
bags
of
bullets
which
did
great
execution
on
the
enemy
about
twenty
satsuma
men
were
killed
and
the
entire
list
of
casualties
did
not
exceed
they
took
a
good
many
prisoners
and
captured
numbers
of
guns
and
small
arms
etc
defection
was
a
great
help
to
the
imperialists
his
men
had
been
fighting
against
them
but
when
the
mikado
standards
the
sun
in
gold
on
a
red
ground
and
the
moon
in
silver
were
displayed
they
lost
heart
and
changed
sides
another
of
their
advantages
was
their
good
skirmishing
ninnaji
no
miya
a
prince
of
the
blood
also
known
as
omura
no
gosho
was
the
they
anticipated
that
all
the
clans
as
far
as
hakoné
would
submit
and
that
sendai
would
join
them
kishiû
already
showed
signs
of
a
desire
to
come
to
terms
and
ogaki
had
submitted
as
indeed
had
nearly
all
the
other
clans
who
had
fought
with
the
exception
of
aidzu
they
said
that
iwashita
gotô
and
the
latter
one
of
the
five
runaway
court
nobles
were
to
come
down
to
kôbé
to
communicate
the
mikado
proclamation
to
the
foreign
representatives
it
would
be
the
desire
of
the
new
government
to
show
perfect
impartiality
in
its
relations
with
foreign
states
but
as
the
english
had
been
the
good
friends
of
the
kiôto
party
they
would
always
be
regarded
with
particularly
grateful
and
amicable
feelings
i
remained
with
yoshii
and
terashima
till
ten
in
the
evening
they
seemed
to
admit
that
we
had
acted
within
our
rights
in
seizing
the
steamers
and
while
i
was
with
them
they
wrote
and
despatched
long
letters
to
their
own
people
at
ozaka
explaining
the
affair
and
enclosing
our
notification
they
also
wrote
up
to
kiôto
urging
that
no
time
should
be
lost
in
despatching
the
mikado
messengers
with
the
announcement
to
the
foreign
ministers
early
on
the
morning
of
the
satsuma
troops
came
over
from
nishinomiya
in
large
boats
and
were
landed
at
hiôgo
in
accordance
with
our
agreement
of
the
previous
day
some
retainers
of
omura
in
hizen
watanabé
noboru
and
fukuzaka
kôzô
came
to
inquire
about
our
intentions
with
regard
to
their
steamer
which
had
been
seized
and
was
now
held
by
the
french
the
steamer
belonged
to
uwajima
and
was
only
borrowed
by
omura
for
this
trip
so
i
gave
them
copies
of
our
manifesto
against
bizen
and
another
one
explaining
why
the
steamers
were
seized
and
they
declared
themselves
quite
convinced
that
we
had
acted
rightly
our
bluejackets
however
and
the
americans
and
french
also
were
getting
us
a
bad
name
by
committing
all
sorts
of
petty
pilfering
i
went
to
call
on
katano
commander
of
the
chôshiû
troops
who
said
that
the
two
bizen
had
gone
to
ozaka
or
kiôto
he
did
not
know
which
after
the
affray
on
the
the
rank
and
file
remaining
behind
it
was
on
february
that
the
mikado
messenger
accompanied
by
iwashita
terashima
and
itô
with
a
small
retinue
arrived
at
hiôgo
in
a
little
steamer
belonging
to
geishiû
as
soon
as
i
received
the
note
informing
me
of
this
i
went
over
to
the
chief
on
whom
devolved
the
task
of
seeing
his
colleagues
and
arranging
with
them
the
place
and
hour
of
meeting
apparently
they
were
greatly
annoyed
especially
the
french
minister
at
finding
themselves
as
it
were
ignored
and
that
their
english
colleague
had
thus
become
the
channel
of
communication
between
the
mikado
and
themselves
they
tried
to
pump
him
about
the
contents
of
the
imperial
message
but
he
did
not
tell
them
even
the
little
he
knew
it
having
been
decided
that
the
interview
should
take
place
at
the
at
noon
on
the
following
day
i
went
over
to
hiôgo
and
informed
iwashita
there
had
been
a
report
that
bizen
men
had
entered
the
town
but
i
could
not
find
a
trace
of
them
all
our
marines
had
been
withdrawn
on
account
of
the
difficulty
experienced
in
forming
mixed
posts
and
the
americans
now
had
charge
of
the
gate
in
the
middle
of
the
town
so
that
they
would
henceforth
be
responsible
for
all
the
petty
pilfering
that
went
on
i
found
them
most
unpleasantly
strict
and
because
i
had
no
pass
they
obliged
me
to
go
a
long
way
round
in
order
to
reach
my
destination
and
get
back
again
so
on
the
of
february
the
fateful
communication
was
made
by
at
the
place
and
hour
previously
fixed
was
a
small
man
even
for
a
japanese
with
sparkling
eyes
irregular
teeth
which
were
not
yet
completely
freed
from
the
black
dye
worn
by
court
nobles
and
with
a
stutter
in
his
speech
the
document
was
drawn
up
in
classical
chinese
and
might
be
thus
translated
the
emperor
of
japan
announces
to
the
sovereigns
of
all
foreign
countries
and
to
their
subjects
that
permission
has
been
granted
to
the
shôgun
tokugawa
yoshinobu
to
return
the
governing
power
in
accordance
with
his
own
request
we
shall
henceforward
exercise
supreme
authority
in
all
the
internal
and
external
affairs
of
the
country
consequently
the
title
of
emperor
must
be
substituted
for
that
of
tycoon
in
which
the
treaties
have
been
made
officers
are
being
appointed
by
us
to
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
it
is
desirable
that
the
representatives
of
the
treaty
powers
recognize
this
announcement
february
mutsushito
keiki
by
which
he
was
usually
spoken
of
is
the
pronunciation
of
the
two
chinese
characters
with
which
his
name
yoshinobu
was
written
this
document
was
very
ingeniously
framed
it
assumed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
treaties
were
binding
on
the
mikado
and
therefore
only
mentioned
them
incidentally
in
saying
that
the
mikado
title
must
be
substituted
for
that
of
tycoon
after
the
translation
had
been
made
and
shown
to
all
the
ministers
a
fire
of
questions
was
directed
against
the
envoy
who
answered
them
well
roches
asked
whether
the
authority
extended
throughout
the
whole
of
japan
to
which
he
replied
coolly
that
the
rebellion
of
tokugawa
prevented
that
from
being
the
case
at
present
but
it
would
gradually
extend
all
over
the
empire
interpreter
who
was
a
tokugawa
man
then
made
a
wilful
mistake
by
representing
the
envoy
to
say
that
if
all
the
people
submitted
to
the
mikado
he
would
be
able
to
govern
the
country
whereas
he
really
said
the
people
will
all
submit
to
the
mikado
as
a
natural
consequence
of
his
taking
the
reins
as
we
ascertained
on
repeating
the
question
with
regard
to
the
bizen
affray
the
mikado
government
undertook
to
protect
the
lives
and
property
of
foreigners
at
kôbé
for
the
future
and
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
the
foreign
representatives
for
the
punishment
of
bizen
on
these
conditions
it
was
agreed
that
the
marines
and
bluejackets
should
be
withdrawn
to
the
ships
and
the
steamers
released
ozaka
was
not
as
yet
perfectly
quiet
but
normal
conditions
would
soon
be
restored
and
foreigners
would
be
formally
invited
to
return
there
on
the
part
of
the
mikado
government
the
envoy
desired
to
know
whether
the
foreign
representatives
would
report
the
announcement
to
their
governments
and
proclaim
it
to
their
people
this
was
tantamount
to
asking
for
recognition
roches
became
very
angry
and
said
we
must
not
throw
ourselves
upon
the
necks
of
these
people
whereupon
the
italian
comte
de
la
tour
and
the
german
von
brandt
raised
their
voices
against
him
and
replied
that
so
far
from
doing
anything
of
the
sort
we
had
waited
till
they
came
to
seek
us
not
knowing
of
course
of
our
secret
negotiations
at
the
satsuma
in
ozaka
on
this
everyone
said
he
would
report
to
his
government
and
that
satisfied
the
envoy
a
great
deal
of
desultory
conversation
went
on
while
he
was
waiting
for
the
gunboat
to
convey
him
back
to
hiôgo
but
on
no
particularly
important
topic
itô
said
to
me
that
it
was
all
right
about
our
going
to
kiôto
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
i
pretended
to
be
indifferent
though
in
truth
i
was
very
eager
to
get
a
view
of
the
city
and
its
famous
buildings
from
which
foreigners
had
been
so
jealously
excluded
for
over
two
centuries
next
day
at
his
own
request
went
to
visit
ocean
a
joint
note
was
sent
in
to
him
demanding
reparation
for
the
bizen
offence
namely
a
full
and
ample
apology
and
the
capital
punishment
of
the
officer
who
gave
the
order
to
fire
the
ministers
and
especially
roches
insisted
that
the
fact
that
they
were
under
fire
increased
the
gravity
of
the
offence
as
if
their
presence
there
could
have
been
known
to
the
bizen
troops
passing
through
on
the
march
itô
seemed
to
think
that
the
government
would
agree
to
make
the
bizen
perform
he
said
that
chôshiû
had
relinquished
to
the
mikado
the
territories
he
had
conquered
in
kokura
on
the
south
side
of
the
strait
of
shimonoséki
and
in
the
province
of
iwami
katsura
kido
and
itô
wanted
him
to
go
much
farther
and
resign
to
the
mikado
all
his
lands
retainers
and
other
possessions
except
so
much
as
might
be
required
for
the
support
of
his
household
if
all
the
would
do
this
a
powerful
central
government
might
be
formed
which
was
impossible
with
the
existing
system
japan
could
not
be
strong
as
long
as
it
was
open
to
every
to
withdraw
his
assistance
at
his
own
pleasure
and
each
prince
to
drill
his
troops
after
a
different
fashion
it
was
the
story
of
the
north
german
confederation
over
again
the
petty
sovereigns
must
be
swallowed
up
by
some
bigger
one
the
of
matsuyama
and
takamatsu
in
shikoku
who
were
partizans
of
the
tokugawa
would
be
destroyed
and
their
territories
imperialized
tosa
was
charged
with
the
execution
of
this
measure
having
offered
to
undertake
the
duty
it
was
probable
that
himéji
a
few
miles
west
of
hiôgo
would
also
be
attacked
by
the
imperialists
a
notification
signed
by
iwashita
itô
and
terashima
as
officers
of
the
foreign
department
was
placarded
about
the
town
informing
the
people
that
the
mikado
would
observe
the
treaties
and
enjoining
on
them
proper
behaviour
towards
foreigners
it
was
given
out
that
roches
with
his
interpreter
shiwoda
would
leave
that
evening
for
europe
baron
brin
the
secretary
remaining
in
charge
the
official
declaration
made
the
day
before
by
the
kiôto
envoy
had
quite
thrown
him
on
his
and
he
could
not
bear
to
stand
by
and
see
his
policy
turn
out
a
complete
failure
his
intention
was
to
proceed
first
to
yokohama
where
i
suspected
that
he
would
try
to
rehabilitate
his
reputation
as
a
diplomatist
by
some
of
his
artful
tricks
however
he
thought
better
of
this
idea
and
remained
in
japan
until
matters
shaped
themselves
so
that
he
could
accept
the
mikado
invitation
to
kiôto
and
so
decently
recognize
the
new
political
arrangements
the
other
ministers
behaved
very
correctly
having
very
little
to
do
but
to
follow
parkes
lead
the
foreign
ministers
had
another
interview
on
february
with
who
was
accompanied
by
iwashita
and
gotô
they
told
us
that
itô
was
to
act
temporarily
as
superintendent
of
customs
and
governor
of
the
town
of
kôbé
it
seemed
curious
we
thought
that
a
man
of
certainly
not
very
high
rank
should
be
thought
fit
for
this
double
post
and
that
the
common
people
should
be
ready
to
obey
him
but
the
japanese
lower
classes
as
i
noted
in
my
diary
had
a
great
appetite
for
being
governed
and
were
ready
to
submit
to
any
one
who
claimed
authority
over
them
especially
if
there
appeared
to
be
a
military
force
in
the
background
itô
had
the
great
recommendation
in
his
favour
that
he
spoke
english
a
very
uncommon
japanese
accomplishment
in
those
days
especially
in
the
case
of
men
concerned
in
the
political
movement
it
would
not
be
difficult
owing
to
the
submissive
habits
of
the
people
for
foreigners
to
govern
japan
if
they
could
get
rid
of
the
class
but
the
foreigners
who
were
to
do
the
governing
should
all
of
them
speak
read
and
write
the
japanese
language
otherwise
they
would
make
a
complete
failure
of
their
undertaking
but
as
the
were
existent
in
large
numbers
the
idea
was
incapable
of
realization
looking
back
now
in
it
seems
perfectly
ludicrous
that
such
a
notion
should
have
been
entertained
even
as
a
joke
for
a
single
moment
by
any
one
who
understood
the
japanese
spirit
gotô
was
to
proceed
to
kiôto
with
the
joint
note
about
the
bizen
business
and
there
was
every
reason
to
expect
that
the
court
would
agree
to
the
infliction
of
the
capital
sentence
but
they
would
probably
desire
to
let
the
hiki
tatéwaki
perform
instead
of
having
him
decapitated
at
least
that
was
what
i
heard
privately
from
my
japanese
friends
who
also
asked
that
until
the
question
was
finally
disposed
of
foreigners
should
abstain
from
visiting
nishinomiya
where
bizen
men
were
stationed
everything
was
now
reported
to
be
quiet
at
ozaka
and
we
looked
forward
to
returning
there
in
a
few
days
gotô
kiûjirô
as
he
had
called
himself
previously
now
resumed
his
real
name
of
nakai
and
was
attached
to
the
foreign
department
he
was
a
very
cheery
and
gay
personality
always
ready
for
any
kind
of
fun
and
jollity
and
when
an
entertainment
had
to
be
got
up
it
was
to
him
that
its
organization
and
conduct
were
entrusted
in
this
way
he
earned
the
nickname
of
no
jester
of
the
foreign
department
on
the
with
his
staff
came
to
the
consulate
to
talk
business
with
sir
harry
and
von
brandt
a
talk
which
lasted
three
hours
we
exhibited
to
them
all
the
treaties
conventions
and
agreements
respecting
the
opening
of
the
ports
all
of
which
had
to
be
confirmed
by
the
chief
minister
for
foreign
affairs
ninnaji
no
miya
a
prince
of
the
blood
in
the
name
of
the
mikado
there
was
much
said
by
way
of
question
and
answer
about
the
recent
transactions
at
kiôto
which
ended
in
their
promising
to
furnish
a
detailed
narrative
rebutting
the
statements
made
by
ogasawara
iki
no
kami
and
other
supporters
of
the
former
the
general
council
which
keiki
complained
had
been
violently
anticipated
by
satsuma
ought
to
have
met
on
december
the
western
waited
a
considerable
time
after
this
date
but
none
of
the
others
arrived
so
they
were
compelled
to
take
action
the
demands
made
on
the
were
that
together
with
the
governing
power
they
should
surrender
as
much
territory
as
would
suffice
to
maintain
that
power
they
estimated
that
of
lands
would
then
be
left
to
the
tokugawa
family
besides
the
territories
of
the
and
most
of
the
tokugawa
had
declined
but
offered
to
surrender
of
lands
and
to
continue
his
subsidy
for
the
support
of
the
imperial
establishment
when
leaving
kiôto
however
he
had
agreed
to
make
the
surrender
demanded
of
him
though
this
was
strenuously
opposed
by
aidzu
and
kuwana
then
when
echizen
and
owari
came
down
to
ozaka
they
invited
him
back
to
kiôto
to
conclude
these
arrangements
but
it
was
never
intended
that
aidzu
and
kuwana
should
form
the
van
of
his
retinue
and
that
was
how
it
happened
that
fighting
ensued
at
the
date
of
this
conversation
nearly
all
the
west
of
hakoné
had
been
reduced
or
had
given
in
their
adhesion
or
would
soon
be
compelled
by
force
to
submit
to
the
mikado
and
thus
about
seven
out
of
the
eight
million
of
lands
possessed
by
tokugawa
would
be
actually
in
the
hands
of
the
mikado
if
tokugawa
then
submitted
he
would
be
left
peaceably
with
the
remainder
of
his
possessions
it
was
to
be
feared
however
that
he
would
endeavour
to
regain
what
he
had
lost
and
in
that
case
the
mikado
party
would
destroy
him
it
was
intended
to
despatch
forces
against
him
by
the
road
which
passes
through
the
provinces
of
echizen
and
kaga
by
the
central
road
through
shinshiû
and
by
the
tôkaidô
ii
kamon
no
kami
of
hikoné
and
later
adherents
to
the
kiôto
party
would
be
placed
in
the
van
of
the
imperial
forces
in
order
that
their
fidelity
might
be
tested
the
of
the
north
had
nothing
to
thank
tokugawa
for
and
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
support
him
awa
had
submitted
and
was
assisting
in
garrisoning
hiôgo
prisoners
taken
in
kiôto
during
the
recent
fighting
would
be
returned
to
their
homes
on
the
restoration
of
peace
instead
of
being
put
to
death
according
to
the
ancient
japanese
custom
in
civil
war
we
understood
that
the
mikado
party
intended
to
call
upon
the
foreign
powers
to
observe
strict
neutrality
a
report
went
about
that
nambu
yahachirô
and
shibayama
riôsuké
old
friends
of
mine
in
the
satsuma
at
yedo
had
been
put
to
death
the
one
by
crucifixion
the
other
by
simple
decapitation
and
i
felt
that
i
should
like
to
do
something
to
avenge
them
for
to
western
minds
the
idea
of
taking
the
lives
of
prisoners
was
revolting
we
heard
that
old
matsudaira
kansô
the
retired
of
hizen
as
he
was
universally
regarded
was
expected
to
make
his
appearance
shortly
at
kiôto
also
that
the
governors
of
nagasaki
had
departed
and
that
the
town
was
occupied
by
satsuma
geishiû
and
tosa
hizen
holding
the
batteries
the
mail
which
reached
us
on
february
brought
a
letter
from
iki
no
kami
to
sir
harry
very
diplomatically
framed
in
which
keiki
failure
to
reach
kiôto
was
attributed
entirely
to
the
machinations
of
satsuma
and
a
hope
was
expressed
that
a
momentary
success
on
the
part
of
the
latter
would
not
cause
the
violation
of
engagements
of
long
standing
he
entirely
burked
the
question
put
to
him
by
locock
as
to
the
course
the
chief
should
take
in
case
the
mikado
sent
an
envoy
to
the
foreign
representatives
the
news
came
from
home
that
mukôyama
had
complained
at
the
foreign
office
of
sir
harry
having
applied
the
title
of
highness
to
the
tycoon
instead
of
majesty
to
this
lord
stanley
replied
that
he
understood
there
was
a
higher
title
than
that
of
in
use
in
japan
and
that
consequently
could
not
mean
majesty
which
was
the
highest
designation
applicable
to
any
potentate
it
was
also
a
noteworthy
fact
that
in
this
letter
of
iki
no
kami
which
is
synonymous
with
majesty
was
reserved
for
the
queen
being
used
of
the
tycoon
as
modern
slang
would
have
it
this
was
giving
away
the
whole
show
hayato
no
shô
who
went
to
europe
for
the
french
exhibition
of
godai
and
terashima
came
to
see
me
after
which
they
had
a
long
talk
with
the
chief
on
political
matters
they
told
him
that
in
three
weeks
or
a
month
time
affairs
would
have
made
sufficient
progress
at
kiôto
to
enable
the
government
to
invite
the
foreign
representatives
thither
in
order
to
enter
on
friendly
relations
they
also
asked
for
the
loan
of
a
surgeon
to
attend
to
their
wounded
at
kiôto
the
chief
replied
that
the
alleviation
of
suffering
in
the
case
of
any
human
being
was
always
a
pleasure
and
that
as
the
legation
doctor
had
looked
after
the
wounds
of
aidzu
men
no
objection
could
exist
to
his
treating
the
hurts
of
others
but
his
consent
would
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
reply
the
ministers
received
about
the
bizen
affair
the
question
of
the
legation
returning
to
ozaka
was
mooted
and
buddhist
temples
were
offered
for
our
accommodation
as
the
buildings
which
we
had
occupied
behind
the
castle
had
been
too
much
knocked
about
to
be
fit
for
a
residence
but
this
would
not
matter
much
as
they
would
be
occupied
only
temporarily
godai
and
terashima
were
very
anxious
that
i
and
i
alone
should
visit
ozaka
at
once
in
fact
i
believed
i
could
have
gone
anywhere
that
i
liked
for
instance
to
kiôto
the
next
day
by
only
expressing
a
wish
godai
wanted
to
buy
an
english
with
which
to
attack
yedo
it
was
a
curious
notion
that
we
had
ships
for
sale
i
advised
them
to
get
their
note
demanding
neutrality
on
the
part
of
all
foreign
powers
sent
in
at
once
because
then
they
could
request
the
american
minister
to
prevent
the
stonewall
jackson
being
delivered
to
the
tokugawa
people
as
well
as
the
two
from
france
which
were
expected
godai
said
further
that
uyésugi
and
sataké
two
of
déwa
province
had
asked
to
have
the
duty
of
chastising
aidzu
entrusted
to
them
and
their
request
had
been
granted
next
day
they
brought
notes
from
enclosing
copy
of
the
instructions
he
had
received
from
daté
iyo
no
kami
uwajima
and
sanjô
sanéyoshi
one
of
the
fugitive
court
nobles
accepting
on
behalf
of
the
mikado
government
the
terms
of
settlement
of
the
bizen
affair
laid
down
by
the
foreign
representatives
namely
the
capital
punishment
of
the
officer
who
had
given
the
order
to
fire
on
foreigners
and
the
apology
the
ministers
expressed
themselves
gratified
with
the
promptness
of
the
reply
which
was
received
hours
before
the
expiration
of
the
delay
accorded
they
said
they
would
wait
three
or
four
days
for
the
letters
of
apology
and
for
the
announcement
of
detailed
arrangements
for
carrying
out
the
execution
godai
and
terashima
stated
that
if
bizen
were
to
refuse
to
surrender
the
officer
the
mikado
troops
would
compel
obedience
they
also
brought
a
note
from
ninnaji
no
miya
ratifying
the
treaties
and
all
subsequent
engagements
in
the
name
of
the
mikado
and
notifying
his
own
appointment
as
chief
administrator
of
foreign
affairs
with
daté
sanjô
and
as
his
assistants
there
was
also
a
note
demanding
strict
neutrality
on
the
part
of
the
british
government
and
its
subjects
and
a
like
note
to
each
of
the
other
representatives
facsimiles
of
the
mikado
notification
to
the
treaty
powers
were
also
handed
to
those
of
the
ministers
who
had
not
yet
received
it
the
request
for
willis
to
go
to
kiôto
to
treat
the
wounded
was
repeated
and
granted
and
a
proposal
made
by
myself
to
accompany
him
was
accepted
with
alacrity
news
was
received
that
day
from
nagasaki
that
the
withdrawal
of
the
governor
kawadzu
idzu
no
kami
had
been
quietly
effected
on
the
night
of
the
and
a
provisional
government
formed
on
the
following
day
of
all
the
agents
in
the
port
thirteen
clans
in
all
the
direction
of
local
affairs
had
been
offered
by
the
governor
to
hizen
and
chikuzen
but
they
declined
undertaking
such
a
responsibility
without
the
of
the
other
clans
all
the
subordinate
officials
and
interpreters
as
well
as
troops
raised
at
nagasaki
for
defensive
purposes
were
taken
over
by
the
provisional
government
so
that
the
business
of
the
port
had
not
been
interrupted
for
a
single
day
a
few
fires
broke
out
but
were
soon
extinguished
chapter
xxvii
first
visit
to
kioto
the
next
day
was
taken
up
with
our
preparations
for
kiôto
including
the
purchase
of
sufficient
stores
for
a
fortnight
saionji
yukiyé
of
uwajima
called
and
i
offered
him
a
passage
to
ozaka
in
the
gunboat
which
was
to
convey
willis
and
myself
to
the
of
our
journey
a
satsuma
man
named
oyama
yasuké
whom
i
had
known
in
yedo
came
to
announce
himself
as
commander
of
our
escort
that
european
surgical
skill
was
very
necessary
for
the
treatment
of
the
wounded
can
be
seen
from
the
fact
i
find
recorded
in
one
of
my
letters
home
that
the
japanese
surgeons
had
sewn
up
all
the
gunshot
wounds
and
some
of
their
patients
died
from
this
cause
the
prospect
of
visiting
the
city
from
which
foreigners
had
been
rigidly
excluded
ever
since
the
ports
were
opened
in
was
enticing
especially
as
we
were
now
being
invited
thither
by
the
very
people
who
we
were
told
by
the
tycoon
officials
had
all
along
tried
to
keep
us
out
afterwards
oyama
in
manchuria
in
in
the
war
sir
harry
was
now
in
high
spirits
and
in
very
good
temper
we
had
no
more
of
the
interviews
with
japanese
officials
at
which
he
used
strong
language
and
interpreting
for
him
which
used
to
be
a
painful
duty
was
changed
into
a
labour
of
love
success
makes
a
man
kind
and
certainly
sir
harry
had
been
successful
by
the
departure
of
the
french
minister
he
became
the
of
the
diplomatic
body
and
the
rest
of
his
colleagues
followed
his
lead
with
perfect
unanimity
for
they
had
begun
to
see
that
his
policy
was
the
right
one
to
adopt
it
was
his
influence
that
induced
his
colleagues
to
join
him
in
issuing
declarations
of
neutrality
in
the
conflict
between
the
mikado
and
the
tycoon
which
among
other
things
prevented
the
delivery
to
the
latter
of
the
american
ram
stonewall
jackson
bought
with
japanese
money
these
declarations
were
subsequent
to
the
departure
of
roches
to
yokohama
and
while
his
secretary
baron
brin
was
in
charge
of
the
french
legation
we
started
about
nine
in
the
morning
of
february
on
board
the
gunboat
cockchafer
having
in
our
train
noguchi
a
named
tetsu
one
of
my
japanese
escort
named
matsushita
and
willis
servant
the
faithful
sahei
off
the
ozaka
bar
we
found
the
satsuma
steamer
keangsoo
and
another
engaged
in
disembarking
a
large
body
of
troops
on
landing
at
the
city
we
found
lodgings
had
been
taken
for
us
at
a
buddhist
temple
close
to
a
burnt
satsuma
called
takamatsu
and
no
sooner
had
we
seated
ourselves
than
a
messenger
arrived
in
the
person
of
koba
dennai
secretary
to
ask
us
to
stop
two
or
three
days
in
ozaka
so
that
willis
might
see
some
men
who
were
ill
of
fever
and
that
boats
to
convey
us
up
the
river
were
not
obtainable
we
replied
that
willis
had
not
made
any
preparations
for
treating
fever
patients
and
had
brought
appliances
for
wounds
only
that
we
supposed
boats
were
as
numerous
at
ozaka
as
they
had
been
before
the
recent
fighting
and
that
we
could
not
understand
this
delay
being
interposed
after
we
had
been
so
urged
and
hurried
by
iwashita
and
terashima
who
had
wished
us
to
start
even
a
day
earlier
than
we
had
found
possible
so
the
secretary
went
out
and
yasuké
after
him
they
stayed
away
a
whole
hour
and
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
permission
to
bring
us
into
kiôto
had
been
revoked
resolving
to
return
to
kôbé
rather
than
waste
our
time
at
ozaka
at
four
oyama
returned
bringing
with
him
an
old
ugly
fellow
named
ijichi
shôji
who
appeared
to
be
one
of
the
satsuma
generals
after
bestowing
on
us
a
vast
quantity
of
complimentary
phrases
this
individual
brought
out
in
a
jerky
st
dance
sort
of
way
the
same
sort
of
excuses
as
had
been
made
by
secretary
to
this
we
returned
the
same
answer
as
before
with
the
addition
that
if
they
found
it
inconvenient
to
receive
us
in
kiôto
we
would
go
back
at
once
to
kôbé
this
decided
attitude
induced
ijichi
to
give
orders
at
once
for
boats
to
be
got
ready
and
we
then
went
off
to
see
the
castle
ruins
there
was
a
notice
at
the
front
gate
refusing
entrance
to
any
but
satsuma
and
chôshiû
men
but
as
we
had
one
of
the
former
clan
with
us
we
found
no
difficulty
in
gaining
access
passing
through
the
gate
we
came
upon
a
wide
scene
of
desolation
the
towers
and
wall
of
the
inner
moat
were
gone
all
the
barracks
and
towers
of
the
outer
wall
to
the
south
likewise
only
the
stones
of
the
gateway
to
the
right
remained
we
passed
into
the
or
keep
through
the
gateway
constructed
with
huge
blocks
of
stone
the
largest
measuring
by
feet
and
by
feet
nothing
was
left
but
the
masonry
giving
somewhat
of
the
look
of
the
ancient
greek
cyclopean
walls
of
tiryns
the
magnificent
palace
itself
had
disappeared
all
that
there
was
to
show
where
it
had
once
stood
was
a
level
surface
covered
with
tiles
the
way
to
the
foundation
tower
of
the
remained
clear
and
we
mounted
to
the
summit
here
in
the
exfoliation
of
the
stones
were
traces
of
a
former
conflagration
a
plaster
wall
built
right
round
had
escaped
not
only
the
flames
but
also
the
explosion
of
the
great
magazine
close
underneath
four
doors
in
this
wall
gave
on
to
the
outer
parapet
from
which
the
view
of
the
river
with
its
three
great
bridges
winding
through
the
city
to
the
sea
and
the
hills
on
the
further
side
of
the
bay
surpassed
anything
i
had
ever
seen
in
the
opposite
direction
the
stream
could
be
distinguished
here
and
there
as
it
meandered
through
the
fields
down
from
fushimi
the
interior
of
the
castle
had
been
completely
destroyed
with
the
exception
of
a
few
rows
of
which
had
escaped
through
being
situated
to
windward
of
the
flames
the
three
concentric
walls
of
masonry
including
the
one
from
which
we
looked
reminded
one
of
the
appearance
that
west
tower
of
babel
would
have
presented
if
viewed
from
above
we
sounded
the
well
whence
is
drawn
the
famous
or
golden
water
and
found
the
depth
to
be
feet
issuing
again
from
the
gate
at
the
base
of
the
we
came
upon
a
quantity
of
burnt
armour
and
helmets
piled
up
round
a
which
the
flames
had
spared
some
had
been
melted
by
the
violent
heat
into
an
irregular
mass
of
metal
there
were
also
piles
of
thousands
of
matchlock
barrels
with
a
few
rifles
among
them
curious
to
see
what
had
become
of
our
temporary
legation
buildings
we
took
our
way
out
of
the
ruined
tamatsukuri
gate
the
whole
place
excepting
the
houses
that
had
been
occupied
by
mitford
and
myself
was
level
with
the
ground
and
even
they
had
been
gutted
so
completely
by
the
rabble
as
to
be
quite
beyond
the
possibility
of
repair
it
was
a
melancholy
sight
on
returning
to
our
lodging
we
found
godai
who
with
many
profuse
apologies
conducted
us
to
a
house
close
by
which
was
better
fitted
for
inhabitation
by
human
beings
he
explained
that
we
could
not
start
for
kiôto
before
the
following
morning
from
what
he
said
it
appeared
that
delay
in
issuing
the
permission
from
the
imperial
court
for
our
entrance
into
kiôto
was
caused
by
ninnaji
no
miya
having
unexpectedly
gone
there
himself
but
as
he
godai
had
at
once
despatched
a
messenger
the
pass
would
be
received
at
fushimi
the
next
evening
before
our
arrival
there
this
arrangement
being
accepted
by
us
and
its
accompaniments
were
ordered
in
and
singing
girls
attended
to
help
us
pass
away
the
time
february
at
ten
in
the
morning
saw
us
start
in
a
houseboat
from
the
stairs
below
the
burnt
satsuma
the
party
seven
in
number
included
our
merry
friend
oyama
and
another
officer
in
command
of
a
guard
for
our
protection
although
we
had
only
just
breakfasted
and
various
dishes
were
soon
introduced
and
the
entertainment
was
repeated
all
through
the
day
at
short
intervals
it
was
a
fine
morning
and
the
scenery
was
as
beautiful
as
on
the
previous
occasion
in
may
when
willis
wirgman
and
i
had
made
the
same
journey
conversation
naturally
turned
for
the
most
part
on
the
incidents
of
the
recent
fighting
the
tokugawa
forces
had
been
pressing
all
day
along
the
toba
road
until
four
when
they
made
an
attempt
to
force
the
satsuma
position
the
attack
was
met
by
a
steady
fire
from
a
planted
in
the
middle
of
the
path
for
the
road
was
very
little
wider
and
from
three
others
in
position
on
the
left
while
troops
concealed
in
the
brushwood
opened
on
them
with
musketry
this
unexpected
reception
threw
the
tokugawa
men
into
confusion
and
they
retired
precipitately
leaving
numbers
of
dead
and
wounded
on
the
ground
the
imperialists
at
fushimi
on
hearing
the
sound
of
firing
in
the
direction
of
toba
from
which
place
they
were
about
a
mile
distant
attacked
the
tycoon
troops
as
they
formed
outside
the
governor
residence
and
the
fighting
lasted
till
the
middle
of
the
night
the
officers
on
the
tycoon
side
set
the
example
of
flight
and
their
men
could
not
resist
the
temptation
so
that
the
rout
became
general
after
yodo
was
passed
no
more
fighting
occurred
on
the
road
to
ozaka
at
hirakata
the
drilled
infantry
broke
into
the
storehouses
of
the
townspeople
who
had
run
away
and
disguised
themselves
in
the
finest
garments
they
could
find
other
townspeople
pursued
the
marauders
and
killed
six
of
them
we
passed
hirakata
at
four
but
did
not
reach
our
hotel
at
fushimi
till
midnight
tôdô
was
holding
his
old
post
at
yamazaki
and
kaga
occupied
hashimoto
dear
old
yoshii
was
at
our
hotel
to
welcome
us
and
more
respectably
dressed
and
shaven
than
i
had
seen
him
for
a
long
time
past
a
fresh
supply
of
was
produced
and
we
kept
up
the
conversation
till
past
two
in
the
morning
these
late
hours
did
not
prevent
our
being
ready
to
start
at
ten
escorted
by
a
company
of
men
large
palanquins
of
the
sort
called
that
is
with
a
pole
used
by
personages
of
the
highest
rank
had
been
provided
for
us
but
willis
who
was
feet
high
and
big
in
proportion
was
not
able
to
double
himself
up
inside
and
preferred
to
walk
the
route
lay
through
fushimi
for
some
way
issuing
on
to
the
takéda
road
fifteen
feet
wide
then
ascended
to
the
top
of
a
dyke
constructed
to
keep
the
river
within
bounds
crossed
a
bridge
and
so
into
the
city
of
kiôto
at
a
temple
by
the
roadside
we
fell
in
with
komatsu
who
had
followed
us
from
fushimi
and
by
one
we
arrived
at
a
buddhist
temple
close
to
the
satsuma
at
the
back
of
the
imperial
palace
shiuri
no
taiyu
the
prince
of
satsuma
paid
us
a
visit
of
welcome
accompanied
by
his
confidential
adviser
saigô
after
shaking
hands
with
us
both
he
sat
down
in
a
chair
placed
at
the
end
of
the
table
by
the
door
while
we
occupied
chairs
behind
the
table
in
a
position
of
greater
dignity
all
his
attendants
squatted
on
the
floor
after
the
exchange
of
a
few
complimentary
speeches
he
took
his
leave
and
we
accompanied
him
as
far
as
the
door
the
grounds
of
were
extensive
and
well
planted
with
trees
the
temple
itself
a
fine
example
of
wood
architecture
the
state
apartments
divided
off
by
splendid
gold
paper
screens
decorated
with
landscapes
in
indian
ink
the
coffered
ceilings
fifteen
feet
above
the
floor
to
suit
the
convenience
of
us
westerners
a
table
and
chairs
had
been
provided
and
a
luxurious
feast
was
served
immediately
after
the
prince
had
taken
his
leave
in
the
afternoon
willis
went
to
look
after
the
wounded
while
i
took
a
walk
down
to
the
bookshops
in
accompanied
by
an
escort
it
was
not
until
i
reached
this
point
that
the
populace
seemed
to
be
certain
that
i
was
a
foreigner
one
little
boy
asked
whether
i
were
not
a
native
of
loochoo
the
tokugawa
castle
of
nijô
struck
me
as
insignificant
compared
with
many
a
fortress
belonging
to
a
small
fudai
it
was
then
occupied
by
the
troops
of
owari
the
which
had
been
the
of
aidzu
as
military
governor
of
kiôto
was
tenanted
by
a
few
of
tosa
troops
the
men
who
had
accompanied
me
about
the
city
took
the
liberty
of
sitting
down
with
us
to
dinner
and
showed
great
want
of
good
manners
it
was
evident
that
they
took
a
departure
from
the
polite
social
observances
characteristic
of
the
japanese
to
be
an
evidence
of
what
was
held
to
be
civilization
in
their
own
words
next
day
i
went
to
ask
saigô
about
the
settlement
of
the
bizen
affair
he
replied
that
hiki
tatéwaki
the
who
was
riding
in
the
palanquin
could
not
be
regarded
as
free
from
blame
and
that
he
would
be
imprisoned
in
the
charge
of
three
clans
the
officer
who
had
been
riding
on
horseback
would
be
executed
the
mikado
inspectors
would
attend
the
sentence
would
be
pronounced
and
a
copy
would
be
furnished
to
the
foreign
representatives
afterwards
the
sentence
and
an
account
of
the
proceedings
would
be
circulated
throughout
the
country
for
the
information
and
warning
of
others
saigô
said
the
mikado
government
hoped
to
be
able
to
keep
the
whole
of
japan
in
order
so
as
to
prevent
the
necessity
ever
arising
for
foreigners
to
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
i
said
that
this
view
was
shared
by
sir
harry
that
in
regard
of
the
bizen
outrage
he
had
felt
confident
that
an
envoy
would
be
sent
from
the
mikado
and
he
had
therefore
resisted
the
solicitations
of
those
around
him
who
had
urged
that
a
force
should
be
despatched
against
the
bizen
people
at
nishinomiya
he
preferred
to
leave
the
opportunity
open
to
the
mikado
saigô
also
explained
the
reference
in
the
mikado
proclamation
regarding
the
observation
of
the
treaties
to
the
reform
of
abuses
to
mean
that
the
new
government
would
propose
a
revision
of
those
agreements
i
mentioned
three
points
on
which
changes
were
desirable
firstly
the
residence
of
the
foreign
ministers
being
fixed
at
yedo
for
it
was
naturally
supposed
that
the
government
of
the
country
would
in
future
be
conducted
from
kiôto
secondly
the
confinement
of
foreigners
to
a
radius
of
ten
miles
round
treaty
ports
and
thirdly
the
circulation
of
all
foreign
coin
throughout
the
country
while
abolishing
the
ten
limit
it
should
be
made
obligatory
on
a
person
travelling
about
the
country
to
carry
a
passport
signed
either
by
the
minister
or
the
consul
and
countersigned
by
the
governor
of
the
port
from
which
he
set
out
this
last
proposal
was
in
fact
one
made
by
the
japanese
themselves
in
the
afternoon
we
went
to
return
the
call
of
the
prince
of
satsuma
as
during
his
visit
yesterday
he
scarcely
opened
his
lips
but
willis
said
that
he
had
treated
sir
harry
in
the
same
way
when
he
went
to
kagoshima
in
and
that
it
was
supposed
he
was
advised
by
his
councillors
not
to
talk
lest
he
should
make
a
fool
of
himself
a
probable
though
not
very
charitable
explanation
we
spent
the
afternoon
in
exploring
the
city
which
had
been
little
more
than
half
rebuilt
after
it
was
burnt
in
in
the
chôshiû
attack
on
the
palace
next
day
i
went
with
yoshii
to
call
on
gotô
to
whom
i
spoke
about
the
bizen
affair
he
told
me
pretty
much
the
same
thing
as
saigô
but
less
decisively
he
talked
of
executing
the
man
who
used
his
spear
before
the
firing
began
then
he
discussed
the
new
constitution
and
said
he
despaired
of
getting
a
deliberative
assembly
because
the
majority
would
always
be
stupid
and
i
advised
him
to
make
the
experiment
nevertheless
if
the
members
ran
their
heads
against
a
block
of
stone
they
would
learn
reason
from
the
blow
he
seemed
to
favour
the
idea
of
governing
by
a
composed
of
the
prime
minister
and
the
cleverest
men
in
the
country
in
default
of
one
man
of
heroic
mould
who
should
rule
autocratically
of
course
he
included
himself
among
the
cleverest
men
during
this
part
of
our
conversation
gotô
had
excluded
yoshii
as
well
as
saionji
of
uwajima
who
happened
to
be
calling
on
him
and
yoshii
expressed
his
annoyance
to
me
afterwards
at
having
been
treated
with
so
little
confidence
i
pacified
him
by
saying
that
we
had
been
discussing
the
settlement
of
the
bizen
affair
after
these
two
were
admitted
some
general
conversation
ensued
among
them
from
which
i
gathered
that
it
was
by
no
means
decided
as
yet
who
was
to
be
what
and
that
the
chief
men
of
the
different
clans
found
it
difficult
to
manage
each
other
that
mutual
jealousy
and
especially
jealousy
of
satsuma
prevented
their
pulling
together
i
gave
them
a
hint
to
use
in
revising
the
treaties
namely
the
establishment
of
mixed
courts
for
trying
cases
between
foreigners
and
japanese
instead
of
deciding
them
according
to
the
laws
of
the
defendant
nationality
i
also
called
on
katsura
kido
but
we
did
not
meet
till
the
next
day
when
he
came
to
our
lodging
in
company
with
a
chôshiû
naval
captain
named
shinagawa
who
for
some
time
past
had
been
living
in
kiôto
as
a
satsuma
man
yoshii
also
turned
up
but
the
conversation
flagged
until
willis
came
back
from
the
hospital
and
during
lunch
a
heated
argument
arose
as
to
the
best
way
of
preventing
affrays
from
happening
between
japanese
and
foreigners
katsura
and
i
had
previously
agreed
that
the
japanese
government
should
discuss
the
procedure
with
the
foreign
representatives
foreigners
should
be
informed
that
to
break
through
a
procession
is
an
offence
in
japanese
eyes
and
japanese
on
the
other
hand
should
be
taught
that
they
must
not
use
weapons
but
simply
arrest
offenders
and
hand
them
over
to
their
own
authorities
further
that
when
a
train
was
to
pass
along
a
thoroughfare
constables
from
a
mixed
force
of
westerners
and
japanese
should
be
stationed
to
keep
the
road
clear
willis
dissented
from
this
view
and
maintained
that
the
only
way
to
preserve
the
peace
between
foreign
rowdies
and
japanese
bullies
was
to
keep
them
apart
and
to
carry
the
high
road
round
at
the
back
outside
kôbé
my
argument
against
this
in
which
katsura
concurred
was
that
a
change
of
road
would
give
rise
to
a
great
deal
more
between
the
opposite
nationalities
than
the
murder
of
a
few
foreigners
and
that
from
what
we
had
hitherto
seen
in
this
country
a
little
fighting
would
open
the
eyes
of
the
japanese
and
make
us
all
better
friends
than
before
in
fact
we
held
it
was
better
to
apply
caustic
at
once
than
to
let
the
disease
linger
on
and
attempt
to
cure
each
symptom
as
it
presented
itself
we
did
not
settle
the
question
but
i
noted
down
what
precedes
as
being
a
japanese
view
in
the
evening
i
went
to
call
on
okubo
ichizô
a
satsuma
who
was
one
of
the
councillors
of
the
home
department
last
year
he
and
i
had
sent
presents
to
each
other
but
had
never
met
so
i
wished
to
make
his
acquaintance
instead
of
merely
exchanging
formalities
we
had
some
interesting
conversation
he
said
that
infantry
were
being
sent
forward
to
hakoné
and
to
a
pass
on
the
nakasendô
satsuma
and
chôshiû
were
determined
to
prosecute
the
war
and
perfect
unanimity
prevailed
among
the
councillors
even
echizen
and
higo
who
at
first
had
been
opposed
to
the
employment
of
force
were
now
working
with
the
other
clans
the
of
ogaki
who
was
a
councillor
of
the
finance
department
until
recently
an
adherent
of
the
tokugawa
had
expressed
his
hope
that
the
expedition
against
yedo
would
soon
be
sent
on
its
way
probably
the
mikado
would
accompany
the
army
in
person
a
step
which
would
greatly
weaken
the
rebels
he
thought
that
the
return
of
roches
to
france
would
have
the
effect
of
determining
the
tycoon
to
submit
as
he
would
have
no
one
to
rely
on
for
material
assistance
if
he
submitted
his
life
might
be
spared
but
aidzu
and
kuwana
must
lose
their
heads
at
ozaka
the
discovery
had
been
made
of
the
diary
kept
by
a
confidential
adviser
of
keiki
in
which
the
false
hopes
that
had
given
rise
to
the
expedition
against
kiôto
at
the
end
of
last
month
were
plainly
expressed
the
other
clans
were
represented
as
getting
tired
of
satsuma
and
even
chôshiû
to
be
divided
into
two
parties
one
for
war
the
other
for
peace
that
gotô
shôjirô
was
inclined
towards
making
terms
with
the
shôgun
and
that
the
court
desired
to
see
him
back
in
kiôto
but
said
okubo
keiki
was
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
and
now
the
whole
situation
had
completely
changed
those
who
previously
had
wavered
were
now
convinced
of
the
weakness
and
were
eager
to
be
first
in
striking
a
blow
at
the
tokugawa
at
his
request
i
explained
to
him
as
well
as
i
could
the
working
of
our
executive
government
in
combination
with
the
parliamentary
system
the
existence
of
political
parties
and
the
election
of
members
of
the
lower
house
the
bizen
affair
he
said
was
pretty
well
settled
and
his
account
agreed
in
the
main
with
what
saigô
and
gotô
had
told
me
next
day
however
there
arrived
a
very
peevish
letter
from
the
chief
complaining
that
the
bizen
business
did
not
appear
to
be
nearing
a
settlement
that
sufficient
preparations
had
not
been
made
at
ozaka
for
the
reception
of
the
foreign
representatives
that
he
doubted
whether
he
would
ever
go
there
at
all
and
winding
up
by
ordering
willis
and
myself
to
rejoin
him
by
the
at
latest
this
gave
me
one
day
more
at
kiôto
but
it
considerably
upset
willis
arrangements
as
he
had
calculated
on
a
fortnight
stay
okubo
having
called
to
return
my
visit
and
yoshii
also
i
took
the
opportunity
of
urging
on
them
the
necessity
of
settling
bizen
at
once
they
replied
that
they
did
not
belong
to
the
department
concerned
but
undertook
to
see
gotô
and
and
repeat
to
them
what
i
had
said
i
had
to
go
but
left
willis
to
await
further
orders
on
the
saigô
came
to
say
to
me
and
present
me
with
two
large
rolls
of
red
and
white
crape
and
two
of
gold
brocade
he
said
there
was
no
possibility
of
my
carrying
back
the
final
decision
of
the
bizen
affair
when
he
was
gone
yoshii
came
in
he
told
me
sir
harry
perfectly
well
understand
the
cause
of
the
delay
and
had
consented
to
wait
a
week
a
letter
had
gone
from
to
him
which
had
probably
crossed
his
to
me
the
final
decision
would
probably
be
arrived
at
on
the
morrow
or
the
day
after
daté
uwajima
and
gotô
would
go
down
next
day
to
ozaka
and
would
follow
with
the
sentences
of
the
bizen
men
as
soon
as
they
were
made
out
both
saigô
and
yoshii
begged
that
willis
would
stay
five
or
six
days
longer
the
war
news
was
that
the
town
and
territory
of
kuwana
had
submitted
to
the
imperial
messenger
but
the
retainers
replied
that
they
could
not
undertake
for
their
prince
who
was
in
yedo
having
accompanied
keiki
thither
everyone
in
kiôto
hoped
that
the
yedo
people
would
resist
instead
of
peaceably
submitting
for
the
western
men
were
all
spoiling
for
a
fight
at
three
in
the
afternoon
i
therefore
set
out
alone
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
get
through
the
city
to
the
gojô
bridge
as
i
completed
my
as
i
went
and
i
did
not
reach
fushimi
till
dark
there
i
found
oyama
elder
brother
who
was
satsuma
agent
and
from
words
dropped
by
notsu
the
captain
of
my
escort
i
learnt
that
the
orders
to
march
on
yedo
were
expected
to
be
issued
in
a
day
or
two
at
nine
we
embarked
for
ozaka
in
a
fifty
boat
long
and
narrow
with
a
roofing
of
coarse
straw
mats
supported
by
rafters
resting
on
a
pole
laid
from
one
end
of
the
boat
to
the
other
horribly
uncomfortable
and
especially
so
when
crowded
we
got
to
our
destination
at
next
morning
and
i
crossed
to
hiôgo
in
the
gunboat
notsu
said
that
in
the
recent
fighting
the
heads
of
all
the
wounded
who
could
not
escape
had
been
taken
off
a
proceeding
hardly
reconcilable
with
what
we
had
been
told
about
the
resolution
to
spare
the
lives
of
prisoners
unless
indeed
it
was
done
to
put
them
out
of
their
pain
the
next
entry
in
my
journal
is
of
february
when
daté
came
over
from
ozaka
on
arriving
he
went
to
the
consulate
by
invitation
from
the
chief
to
have
lunch
and
began
to
talk
about
the
foreign
representatives
being
presented
to
the
mikado
who
was
to
be
brought
down
to
ozaka
perhaps
by
march
we
had
to
stop
this
interesting
communication
in
order
that
he
might
go
to
call
on
the
other
ministers
in
the
evening
i
went
to
see
him
when
he
told
me
roches
had
asked
to
see
saigô
okubo
komatsu
and
gotô
as
he
understood
they
were
the
leaders
of
the
kiôto
movement
this
had
greatly
annoyed
the
dear
old
man
who
resented
being
ignored
in
that
fashion
and
said
he
hated
roches
and
his
interpreter
roches
had
sent
to
say
he
would
call
next
morning
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
persuaded
him
to
receive
the
visit
instead
of
going
on
board
ocean
on
sir
harry
invitation
inouyé
bunda
whom
i
saw
that
day
told
me
the
french
consul
at
nagasaki
had
refused
to
pay
duties
to
the
provisional
government
and
had
threatened
war
especially
against
satsuma
and
chôshiû
we
had
a
good
laugh
over
this
exhibition
of
impotent
wrath
chapter
xxviii
negotiations
for
audience
of
the
mikado
at
kioto
next
day
daté
introduced
to
the
foreign
representatives
sawa
mondô
no
kami
one
of
the
five
fugitive
court
nobles
of
who
was
proceeding
to
nagasaki
as
governor
together
with
the
of
omura
who
was
to
furnish
his
guard
sawa
wore
rather
a
forbidding
expression
of
countenance
not
to
say
slightly
villainous
but
for
all
that
had
the
look
of
a
good
companion
and
a
year
or
two
later
when
he
was
minister
for
foreign
affairs
we
liked
him
greatly
omura
tango
no
kami
to
give
him
his
full
title
was
a
weak
sickly
looking
man
who
did
not
utter
a
word
during
the
interview
and
seemed
even
afraid
of
speaking
to
a
foreigner
sawa
son
a
young
man
with
the
white
complexion
of
a
woman
was
also
present
after
the
compliments
were
over
these
three
were
turned
out
of
the
room
and
we
learnt
that
the
bizen
affair
would
be
wound
up
by
the
decapitation
of
the
responsible
officer
early
that
morning
the
chief
had
been
asking
my
opinion
about
the
advisability
of
granting
a
reprieve
or
rather
a
mitigation
of
the
penalty
mitford
learnt
from
von
brandt
that
the
colleagues
knew
him
to
have
leanings
that
way
and
that
he
was
believed
to
have
put
forward
polsbroek
the
dutch
political
agent
to
advocate
clemency
mitford
and
i
had
however
agreed
previously
that
lenience
would
be
a
mistake
and
that
was
the
view
i
maintained
in
reply
to
sir
harry
daté
and
sawa
came
to
dinner
that
evening
with
the
chief
an
arrangement
which
he
fancied
he
had
kept
secret
from
his
colleagues
but
they
knew
of
it
as
soon
as
the
invitation
was
accepted
afterwards
there
was
a
long
conversation
which
lasted
until
midnight
a
principal
topic
being
the
proposed
visit
of
the
mikado
to
ozaka
daté
said
the
object
of
the
excursion
was
to
open
the
mind
of
the
young
sovereign
by
showing
him
something
of
the
outer
world
and
also
a
big
english
of
course
he
added
if
the
foreign
diplomats
were
there
at
the
time
they
might
be
presented
parkes
said
the
mikado
might
receive
the
diplomatic
body
as
a
whole
but
not
each
minister
separately
his
object
being
to
secure
priority
of
presentation
for
himself
as
he
had
already
written
home
for
new
credentials
daté
suggested
that
the
capital
might
possibly
be
moved
from
its
present
position
to
ozaka
as
it
was
situated
at
a
spot
hemmed
in
by
mountains
to
which
all
supplies
had
to
be
transported
by
water
my
own
belief
was
that
satsuma
and
chôshiû
wanted
to
get
the
person
of
the
mikado
into
their
own
hands
in
order
to
make
him
march
with
the
army
and
secondly
to
have
him
on
the
in
order
to
be
able
to
cut
and
run
whenever
it
might
become
necessary
this
was
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
mikado
had
issued
an
order
announcing
that
he
was
taking
the
field
in
person
in
reply
to
a
question
as
to
the
fate
of
the
daté
said
it
would
depend
on
circumstances
which
no
one
could
foretell
the
people
of
ozaka
aware
of
the
policy
of
the
late
mikado
and
the
former
political
opinions
of
chôshiû
supposed
that
since
the
court
and
chôshiû
had
come
into
power
foreigners
would
be
generally
obnoxious
not
any
longer
having
the
tokugawa
power
to
defend
them
that
was
the
reason
of
the
populace
having
wrecked
the
various
legations
perhaps
the
bizen
people
had
been
actuated
by
the
same
notions
this
last
suggestion
furnished
an
additional
ground
for
our
refusing
to
reduce
the
capital
sentence
by
this
time
roches
had
come
back
to
kôbé
to
the
great
annoyance
of
his
colleagues
who
considered
that
he
had
played
a
trick
on
them
in
leaving
his
secretary
here
as
chargé
d
affaires
in
order
that
he
might
not
be
unrepresented
and
at
the
same
time
playing
the
part
of
french
minister
in
yedo
it
did
not
cause
us
that
is
mitford
and
myself
much
surprise
when
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
godai
and
itô
came
to
ask
for
the
life
of
taki
zenzaburô
the
retainer
of
hiki
tatéwaki
who
had
been
condemned
to
perform
as
the
penalty
for
ordering
his
soldiers
to
fire
on
foreigners
a
long
discussion
took
place
between
the
foreign
ministers
which
lasted
for
nearly
three
hours
in
which
sir
harry
voted
for
clemency
but
the
majority
were
for
the
sentence
being
carried
out
it
was
eight
in
the
evening
when
godai
and
itô
were
called
back
into
the
room
and
told
in
a
few
words
that
there
was
no
way
but
to
let
the
law
take
its
course
so
we
started
at
nine
mitford
and
myself
with
a
single
representative
of
each
of
the
other
legations
we
were
guided
to
the
buddhist
temple
of
at
hiôgo
arriving
there
at
a
quarter
to
ten
strong
guards
were
posted
in
the
courtyard
and
in
the
we
were
shown
into
a
room
where
we
had
to
squat
on
the
matted
floor
for
about
of
an
hour
during
this
interval
we
were
asked
whether
we
had
any
questions
to
put
to
the
condemned
man
and
also
for
a
list
of
our
names
at
ten
we
were
conducted
into
the
principal
hall
of
the
temple
and
asked
to
sit
down
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
dais
in
front
of
the
altar
then
the
seven
japanese
witnesses
itô
nakashima
sakutarô
two
satsuma
captains
of
infantry
two
chôshiû
captains
and
a
bizen
took
their
places
after
we
had
sat
quietly
thus
for
about
ten
minutes
footsteps
were
heard
approaching
along
the
verandah
the
condemned
man
a
tall
japanese
of
bearing
and
aspect
entered
on
the
left
side
accompanied
by
his
or
best
men
and
followed
by
two
others
apparently
holding
the
same
office
taki
was
dressed
in
blue
of
hempen
cloth
the
wore
war
surcoats
coming
before
the
japanese
witnesses
they
prostrated
themselves
the
bow
being
returned
and
then
the
same
ceremony
was
exchanged
with
us
then
the
condemned
man
was
led
to
a
red
sheet
of
laid
on
the
dais
before
the
altar
on
this
he
squatted
after
performing
two
bows
one
at
a
distance
the
other
close
to
the
altar
with
the
calmest
deliberation
he
took
his
seat
on
the
red
felt
choosing
the
position
which
would
afford
him
the
greatest
convenience
for
falling
forward
a
man
dressed
in
black
with
a
light
grey
hempen
mantle
then
brought
in
the
dirk
wrapped
in
paper
on
a
small
unpainted
wooden
stand
and
with
a
bow
placed
it
in
front
of
him
he
took
it
up
in
both
hands
raised
it
to
his
forehead
and
laid
it
down
again
with
a
bow
this
is
the
ordinary
japanese
gesture
of
thankful
reception
of
a
gift
then
in
a
distinct
voice
very
much
broken
not
by
fear
or
emotion
but
as
it
seemed
reluctance
to
acknowledge
an
act
of
which
he
was
ashamed
declared
that
he
alone
was
the
person
who
on
the
fourth
of
february
had
outrageously
at
kôbé
ordered
fire
to
be
opened
on
foreigners
as
they
were
trying
to
escape
that
for
having
committed
this
offence
he
was
going
to
rip
up
his
bowels
and
requested
all
present
to
be
witnesses
he
next
divested
himself
of
his
upper
garments
by
withdrawing
his
arms
from
the
sleeves
the
long
ends
of
which
he
tucked
under
his
legs
to
prevent
his
body
from
falling
backward
the
body
was
thus
quite
naked
to
below
the
navel
he
then
took
the
dirk
in
his
right
hand
grasping
it
just
close
to
the
point
and
after
stroking
down
the
front
of
his
chest
and
belly
inserted
the
point
as
far
down
as
possible
and
drew
it
across
to
the
right
side
the
position
of
his
clothes
still
fastened
by
the
girth
preventing
our
seeing
the
wound
having
done
this
he
with
great
deliberation
bent
his
body
forward
throwing
the
head
back
so
as
to
render
the
neck
a
fair
object
for
the
sword
the
one
who
had
accompanied
him
round
the
two
rows
of
witnesses
to
make
his
bows
to
them
had
been
crouching
on
his
left
hand
a
little
behind
him
with
drawn
sword
poised
in
the
air
from
the
moment
the
operation
commenced
he
now
sprang
up
suddenly
and
delivered
a
blow
the
sound
of
which
was
like
thunder
the
head
dropped
down
on
to
the
matted
floor
and
the
body
lurching
forward
fell
prostrate
over
it
the
blood
from
the
arteries
pouring
out
and
forming
a
pool
when
the
blood
vessels
had
spent
themselves
all
was
over
the
little
wooden
stand
and
the
dirk
were
removed
itô
came
forward
with
a
bow
asking
had
we
been
witnesses
we
replied
that
we
had
he
was
followed
by
nakashima
who
also
made
a
bow
a
few
minutes
elapsed
and
we
were
asked
were
we
ready
to
leave
we
rose
and
went
out
passing
in
front
of
the
corpse
and
through
the
japanese
witnesses
it
was
twelve
when
we
got
back
to
the
consulate
where
we
found
sir
harry
waiting
up
to
receive
our
report
the
newspaper
reports
which
reached
england
of
this
execution
and
of
the
subsequent
execution
by
of
eleven
tosa
men
at
sakai
gave
a
very
distorted
view
of
the
facts
charles
rickerby
who
was
the
owner
and
editor
of
the
japan
times
of
yokohama
was
responsible
for
the
attempts
to
mislead
public
opinion
in
both
instances
he
invented
an
account
of
the
proceedings
witnessed
by
mitford
and
myself
which
was
entirely
false
and
wound
up
by
saying
that
it
was
disgraceful
for
christians
to
have
attended
the
execution
and
that
he
hoped
the
japanese
if
they
took
revenge
for
this
judicial
murder
would
assassinate
gentlemen
of
the
foreign
legations
rather
than
anyone
else
as
for
being
ashamed
of
having
been
present
at
a
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
disgusting
exhibition
i
was
proud
to
feel
that
i
had
not
shrunk
from
witnessing
a
punishment
which
i
did
my
best
to
bring
about
it
was
no
disgusting
exhibition
but
a
most
decent
and
decorous
ceremony
and
far
more
respectable
than
what
our
own
countrymen
were
in
the
habit
of
producing
for
the
entertainment
of
the
public
in
the
front
of
newgate
prison
the
countrymen
of
this
bizen
man
told
us
that
they
considered
the
sentence
a
just
and
beneficial
one
as
regards
the
case
of
the
tosa
men
at
sakai
no
punishment
was
ever
more
righteously
inflicted
these
japanese
massacred
a
boat
crew
of
inoffensive
and
unarmed
men
who
were
never
alleged
to
have
given
the
slightest
provocation
twenty
were
condemned
to
death
and
one
could
only
regret
that
captain
du
petit
thouars
judged
it
necessary
to
stop
the
execution
when
eleven
had
suffered
for
the
twenty
were
all
equally
guilty
and
requiring
a
life
for
life
of
the
eleven
frenchmen
looked
more
like
revenge
than
justice
a
few
days
afterwards
all
the
ministers
returned
to
ozaka
we
went
over
on
board
ocean
captain
stanhope
she
was
an
of
tons
carrying
rifled
guns
of
the
woolwich
pattern
enough
to
blow
any
vessel
on
the
station
into
tiny
fragments
with
us
went
daté
and
polsbroek
and
the
transport
adventure
conveyed
our
baggage
our
former
temporary
residence
having
been
destroyed
by
fire
we
were
accommodated
at
temples
in
and
were
fortunate
enough
to
light
upon
some
of
the
furniture
stolen
by
the
mob
after
we
decamped
in
january
the
townspeople
recognized
us
as
the
foreigners
who
ran
away
the
other
day
but
they
were
very
civil
and
did
not
shout
after
us
as
they
rudely
did
in
the
last
days
of
the
occupation
of
the
city
from
yedo
we
heard
reports
that
the
feeling
among
tokugawa
people
was
that
he
should
be
compelled
to
perform
and
that
his
principal
advisers
should
be
beheaded
in
order
to
appease
the
imperialists
it
was
difficult
not
to
feel
a
certain
degree
of
sympathy
for
him
mingled
with
resentment
for
he
had
let
us
believe
he
would
fight
at
ozaka
while
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
beat
a
retreat
if
he
had
told
us
the
truth
we
could
have
remained
there
tranquilly
for
we
were
well
assured
of
the
friendliness
of
satsuma
and
chôshiû
the
ocean
steam
launch
landed
us
at
the
foreign
settlement
and
we
marched
through
the
city
with
our
guard
of
the
to
our
new
quarters
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
the
mikado
being
brought
down
to
ozaka
to
see
some
steamers
and
to
meet
the
foreign
ministers
but
i
hoped
this
would
not
happen
if
we
were
to
have
an
audience
of
his
majesty
we
ought
to
have
it
at
kiôto
otherwise
the
ceremony
would
lose
half
its
significance
in
the
afternoon
iyo
no
kami
and
komatsu
paid
friendly
visits
to
sir
harry
it
was
evident
that
we
were
in
a
fair
way
to
regain
the
diplomatic
ascendancy
of
which
we
had
been
deprived
by
the
recall
of
sir
rutherford
alcock
in
when
daté
and
called
next
day
on
the
foreign
representatives
they
came
to
us
last
of
all
which
was
convenient
sir
harry
spoke
to
them
about
the
proposed
audience
of
the
mikado
they
acknowledged
the
advantages
that
would
result
from
its
taking
place
at
kiôto
instead
of
at
ozaka
but
were
evidently
not
prepared
to
promise
that
immediately
the
american
prussian
and
italian
representatives
had
told
daté
that
they
wished
to
leave
in
three
days
time
thus
causing
some
amount
of
consternation
in
the
minds
of
the
japanese
who
desired
to
keep
them
for
the
audience
while
they
fully
appreciated
what
the
chief
told
them
namely
that
the
three
representatives
who
wanted
to
get
away
would
not
stop
for
an
audience
which
was
to
be
merely
incidental
to
the
mikado
visit
to
some
japanese
steamers
it
would
be
unsuitable
to
the
dignity
of
the
representatives
to
be
presented
to
his
majesty
while
at
ozaka
on
a
visit
made
ostensibly
for
a
different
purpose
i
myself
greatly
hoped
that
the
way
in
which
the
chief
had
put
the
matter
would
induce
the
japanese
to
invite
the
ministers
at
once
to
kiôto
that
would
be
the
consummation
of
the
imperialist
theory
and
scheme
von
brandt
had
said
privately
that
he
would
not
accept
even
if
asked
but
publicly
had
said
he
would
while
the
american
minister
was
apparently
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
sir
harry
had
proposed
that
the
mikado
should
receive
the
whole
diplomatic
body
together
on
one
day
and
not
accord
separate
audiences
until
they
could
present
credentials
and
this
suggestion
had
been
readily
adopted
on
the
march
an
important
conference
was
held
between
the
foreign
representatives
and
high
japanese
functionaries
daté
daigo
dainagon
a
court
noble
appointed
governor
of
ozaka
and
of
owari
echizen
satsuma
chôshiû
tosa
geishiû
hizen
higo
and
inshiû
practically
all
the
great
territorial
nobles
of
the
west
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
the
princes
of
echizen
bizen
and
inshiû
now
ranged
among
the
enemies
of
the
tokugawa
were
descended
from
the
founder
of
that
house
the
conference
took
place
in
the
vast
hall
of
the
buddhist
temple
of
nishi
hongwanji
after
the
japanese
ministers
had
expressed
their
good
wishes
for
the
extension
of
friendly
intercourse
between
japan
and
foreign
countries
and
declared
that
the
there
represented
heartily
supported
the
foreign
policy
of
the
mikado
discussions
arose
about
the
ministers
going
up
to
kiôto
for
an
audience
of
the
mikado
about
exchange
of
foreign
coin
for
japanese
and
the
sale
of
land
in
the
foreign
settlements
at
ozaka
and
hiôgo
kôbé
we
were
told
that
letters
were
expected
from
kiôto
in
a
day
or
two
fixing
a
date
for
the
audience
so
that
the
ministers
could
go
up
one
day
see
the
mikado
on
the
next
and
come
down
again
thus
being
absent
only
three
days
from
ozaka
roches
was
of
course
deadly
opposed
to
accepting
any
such
arrangement
van
valkenburg
the
american
von
brandt
and
de
la
tour
the
italian
seemed
unwilling
to
commit
themselves
too
deeply
with
the
imperialists
the
chief
tried
hard
to
conceal
his
determination
to
accept
the
invitation
in
any
case
while
polsbroek
put
on
an
appearance
of
indifference
roches
attempted
to
get
an
unconditional
refusal
conveyed
to
the
japanese
ministers
but
was
unsuccessful
thanks
to
the
watch
i
kept
over
his
interpreter
shiwoda
and
finally
the
decision
was
left
to
depend
on
the
contents
of
the
letters
expected
from
kiôto
yamanouchi
yôdô
the
older
prince
of
tosa
was
reported
to
be
very
ill
at
kiôto
and
the
services
of
willis
were
asked
for
on
his
behalf
this
request
was
readily
acceded
to
by
the
chief
and
willis
started
the
same
evening
accompanied
by
mitford
my
personal
relations
with
the
awa
clan
had
long
been
of
an
intimate
character
and
it
was
therefore
no
surprise
when
hayamidzu
sukéyomon
formerly
awa
agent
at
yedo
and
now
at
ozaka
came
to
call
on
me
on
march
bringing
a
present
of
silk
for
major
crossman
in
return
for
the
treatises
on
artillery
which
the
latter
had
sent
to
awa
no
kami
it
was
with
great
regret
that
i
learnt
from
him
of
the
death
of
that
friendly
and
hospitable
old
gentleman
on
january
his
son
and
successor
who
had
been
kept
at
home
till
the
period
of
mourning
expired
was
now
expected
at
ozaka
on
his
way
to
kiôto
hayamidzu
brought
a
budget
of
yedo
news
which
mostly
proved
afterwards
to
be
little
better
than
mere
gossip
such
as
that
itakura
was
reported
to
have
committed
suicide
by
because
the
other
ministers
of
state
differed
from
him
in
opinion
that
the
and
talked
of
compelling
keiki
to
disembowel
himself
of
cutting
off
the
heads
of
aidzu
and
kuwana
in
order
that
those
two
families
might
escape
destruction
he
had
not
heard
of
keiki
being
allowed
to
retire
into
private
life
and
thought
it
absurd
to
suggest
such
a
step
under
existing
circumstances
his
conduct
had
been
too
shabby
for
him
to
become
entitled
to
such
consideration
on
the
february
hori
kura
no
kami
one
of
the
second
council
had
performed
after
having
vainly
endeavoured
to
persuade
keiki
to
take
that
step
and
offering
to
accompany
him
in
the
act
all
yedo
applauded
kura
no
kami
and
said
keiki
ought
to
follow
his
example
the
said
my
friend
had
no
desire
to
fight
the
awa
clan
was
now
supporting
the
mikado
and
was
taking
part
in
the
expedition
to
subjugate
tokugawa
and
would
like
to
make
a
declaration
to
the
foreign
representatives
such
as
was
made
by
the
other
clans
on
the
previous
day
in
the
afternoon
i
went
to
daté
to
inquire
whether
he
had
any
news
from
kiôto
about
the
invitation
of
the
ministers
he
said
they
would
be
asked
to
start
on
the
but
the
date
of
the
audience
not
having
been
fixed
the
invitations
could
not
be
sent
out
i
advised
him
to
go
at
once
to
invite
each
of
the
ministers
and
to
say
that
the
day
after
their
arrival
in
kiôto
would
be
appointed
for
the
audience
because
he
and
had
written
asking
for
that
arrangement
to
be
made
and
therefore
no
doubt
existed
that
it
would
eventually
be
done
so
off
he
started
beginning
with
the
french
minister
who
kept
him
to
dinner
but
declined
going
to
kiôto
until
he
could
perceive
actual
evidence
of
the
mikado
supremacy
he
was
answered
that
even
were
the
to
be
restored
with
all
its
original
powers
the
mikado
being
undoubtedly
the
sovereign
of
japan
and
the
shôgun
only
his
vicegerent
no
offence
could
possibly
be
given
by
being
received
in
audience
by
the
former
from
him
daté
went
to
the
italian
prussian
american
and
dutch
representatives
the
first
three
refused
on
the
ground
of
pressing
business
at
yokohama
but
the
last
said
he
would
act
in
the
same
way
as
the
british
minister
and
when
iyo
no
kami
came
to
our
chief
he
accepted
the
invitation
chapter
xxix
massacre
of
french
sailors
at
sakai
unfortunately
just
at
this
moment
news
was
received
that
a
of
frenchmen
had
been
massacred
by
the
tosa
troops
at
sakai
this
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
and
to
all
hope
of
going
to
kiôto
for
an
audience
two
men
were
reported
killed
on
the
spot
seven
missing
seven
wounded
while
five
escaped
unhurt
the
account
received
by
daté
just
as
he
left
the
french
legation
was
that
only
one
had
been
killed
it
was
evident
to
everybody
that
the
execution
of
the
bizen
officer
had
not
had
the
effect
of
a
warning
confusion
despair
hopes
dashed
to
the
ground
just
on
the
point
of
fulfilment
no
better
accounts
being
given
by
daté
and
on
the
following
morning
and
the
missing
sailors
not
having
been
given
up
the
foreign
ministers
resolved
to
withdraw
their
flags
when
the
two
japanese
ministers
called
on
the
french
minister
to
express
their
deep
regret
he
refused
to
see
them
and
addressed
a
letter
to
the
japanese
authorities
demanding
the
surrender
of
the
missing
men
by
eight
the
following
morning
the
french
italian
prussian
and
american
representatives
embarked
we
and
the
dutch
political
agent
remained
on
shore
but
on
the
morning
of
the
the
british
flag
was
formally
lowered
and
sir
harry
went
on
board
the
ocean
leaving
russell
robertson
and
myself
at
the
with
lieutenant
bradshaw
and
six
men
of
the
the
dead
bodies
of
the
seven
missing
french
sailors
having
been
found
daté
and
went
on
board
the
french
flagship
vénus
to
inform
roches
but
by
some
curious
blunder
the
boxes
containing
the
corpses
were
sent
first
to
the
british
transport
adventure
where
they
were
mistaken
for
cases
of
curios
belonging
to
our
legation
and
how
the
discovery
was
made
of
the
real
nature
of
the
contents
i
never
heard
but
they
did
not
arrive
at
the
french
flagship
till
late
in
the
afternoon
i
saw
daté
on
his
way
back
who
said
he
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
moderation
with
which
the
french
minister
was
treating
the
affair
next
day
sir
harry
landed
and
carried
off
bradshaw
and
his
men
he
instructed
me
to
call
on
daté
and
say
to
him
that
the
representatives
would
consult
together
after
the
funeral
as
to
the
reparation
to
be
demanded
from
the
government
and
that
if
they
were
unanimous
the
japanese
might
feel
assured
that
the
demands
were
just
in
that
case
the
best
thing
they
could
do
would
be
to
accept
them
without
delay
on
the
other
hand
if
the
requirements
of
roches
exceeded
the
bounds
of
justice
the
other
ministers
would
refuse
to
join
him
and
the
japanese
government
could
then
appeal
to
the
french
government
and
those
of
the
other
foreign
powers
in
sir
harry
own
opinion
a
large
number
of
the
tosa
men
ought
to
suffer
death
but
he
did
not
approve
of
pecuniary
indemnities
having
given
me
these
instructions
he
went
off
to
hiôgo
to
attend
the
funeral
of
the
murdered
frenchmen
eleven
in
all
robertson
and
i
called
on
daté
to
deliver
the
chief
message
and
after
having
executed
our
commission
we
went
with
komatsu
and
nakai
to
a
japanese
restaurant
and
had
a
feast
in
the
usual
style
we
got
home
about
seven
and
as
the
day
was
still
young
we
took
it
into
our
heads
to
give
ourselves
an
entertainment
and
with
a
guide
carrying
a
lantern
went
to
the
quarter
of
the
town
where
such
amusements
are
provided
to
a
house
to
which
i
knew
that
a
foreigner
had
been
introduced
and
that
by
tosa
people
the
master
said
he
was
afraid
of
his
trade
being
injured
if
he
received
foreigners
but
suggested
our
applying
to
the
local
authority
for
permission
while
we
were
still
in
the
shop
a
tosa
man
came
down
from
a
room
upstairs
and
on
seeing
us
asked
for
his
sword
but
the
people
of
the
house
refused
to
give
it
and
led
him
away
it
never
entered
my
head
that
the
master
of
the
house
wished
to
get
rid
of
us
on
account
of
his
tosa
guests
so
we
went
to
the
municipal
office
and
came
back
again
with
the
desired
permission
but
the
landlord
was
still
not
satisfied
we
were
conversing
with
him
when
the
same
tosa
man
came
down
sword
in
hand
and
squatting
down
before
us
with
a
threatening
air
demanded
to
know
who
we
were
and
what
we
were
doing
there
i
replied
that
we
were
english
officers
and
was
proceeding
to
explain
what
we
wanted
but
he
interrupted
by
fiercely
questioning
our
right
to
be
present
one
of
his
companions
roused
by
the
disturbance
came
downstairs
and
carried
him
up
again
the
women
taking
his
sword
and
hiding
it
the
peaceful
man
then
came
to
us
and
was
offering
an
apology
when
the
madcap
descended
again
with
a
naked
weapon
in
his
hand
at
least
that
was
impression
his
friend
rushed
to
stop
him
a
struggle
took
place
on
the
stairs
and
we
bolted
through
the
door
into
the
street
the
master
of
the
house
came
out
after
us
with
our
lantern
saying
that
our
guide
had
disappeared
and
as
he
was
not
to
be
found
the
old
man
had
to
escort
us
home
mitford
and
willis
arrived
back
from
kiôto
on
the
sir
letter
giving
permission
for
the
latter
to
remain
having
crossed
him
on
the
way
having
made
arrangements
for
his
going
back
again
we
went
on
board
the
adventure
to
see
the
chief
and
while
we
were
there
daté
and
komatsu
arrived
to
tell
him
what
the
french
minister
demands
were
namely
the
execution
of
all
the
men
concerned
in
the
massacre
about
twenty
tosa
men
and
twenty
townspeople
armed
with
they
told
us
for
the
families
of
the
murdered
men
apology
of
the
principal
minister
for
foreign
affairs
at
ozaka
this
was
yamashina
no
miya
a
prince
of
the
blood
apology
of
the
tosa
yamanouchi
tosa
no
kami
on
board
a
french
at
susaki
the
port
of
tosa
the
exclusion
of
all
tosa
armed
men
from
treaty
ports
and
cities
these
had
all
been
agreed
to
we
then
returned
ashore
and
started
willis
on
his
way
back
to
kiôto
next
day
we
moved
over
to
hiôgo
on
board
adventure
all
the
foreign
representatives
had
addressed
notes
to
the
japanese
government
counselling
them
to
comply
with
the
french
demands
hasé
sammi
a
court
noble
arrived
as
an
envoy
from
the
mikado
to
the
french
minister
bearing
a
message
of
condolence
he
afterwards
saw
sir
harry
and
arranged
with
him
that
he
should
go
to
kiôto
for
an
audience
of
the
mikado
as
soon
as
this
affair
was
disposed
of
roches
had
not
fixed
any
date
but
it
was
expected
by
the
japanese
authorities
that
everything
would
be
finished
by
the
roches
seemed
to
be
harping
on
one
string
that
it
would
be
regrettable
if
any
single
representative
went
to
kiôto
by
himself
and
komatsu
who
told
us
that
he
had
expressed
himself
to
hasé
in
that
sense
thought
that
this
was
intended
as
a
hit
at
sir
harry
however
polsbroek
had
also
promised
the
japanese
that
he
too
would
go
up
to
kiôto
as
soon
as
satisfaction
for
the
tosa
outrage
were
afforded
next
day
daté
arrived
at
six
with
komatsu
and
went
on
board
the
french
flagship
to
deliver
to
roches
the
note
accepting
his
demands
the
demand
was
understood
to
mean
not
merely
that
no
tosa
troops
should
garrison
treaty
ports
and
cities
but
that
no
tosa
of
any
class
should
be
allowed
at
the
treaty
ports
this
appeared
to
be
too
severe
and
we
held
that
it
would
have
to
be
modified
after
he
had
finished
with
roches
daté
came
over
to
see
sir
harry
and
to
tell
him
what
had
been
arranged
two
officers
and
eighteen
rank
and
file
were
to
perform
at
sakai
at
two
the
next
day
and
yamashina
no
miya
was
simultaneously
to
call
on
roches
to
deliver
the
apology
and
also
invite
him
to
kiôto
on
the
day
after
that
the
prince
was
to
call
on
sir
harry
at
the
same
hour
on
board
ocean
at
kôbé
we
were
to
leave
kôbé
for
ozaka
on
the
pass
the
night
of
the
at
fushimi
and
enter
kiôto
the
next
day
on
the
we
were
to
receive
visits
and
have
audience
of
the
emperor
on
the
this
was
only
a
private
and
confidential
arrangement
with
daté
and
would
only
become
official
after
yamashina
no
miya
delivered
the
formal
invitation
in
accordance
with
this
programme
the
prince
who
was
a
first
cousin
once
removed
of
the
mikado
and
principal
minister
for
foreign
affairs
came
to
kôbé
on
the
to
call
on
sir
harry
and
polsbroek
we
learnt
from
him
that
roches
had
begged
off
nine
out
of
the
twenty
condemned
men
taking
only
one
life
for
each
of
the
murdered
frenchmen
and
that
he
had
decided
to
go
to
kiôto
having
heard
from
daté
that
sir
harry
would
accept
the
invitation
the
miya
was
dressed
in
the
same
costume
as
the
other
court
nobles
we
had
seen
a
purple
silk
robe
and
a
small
wrinkled
hat
perched
on
the
top
of
the
head
his
age
might
be
about
fifty
and
he
wore
a
short
beard
and
moustache
his
teeth
bore
marked
signs
of
having
been
once
dyed
black
he
was
accompanied
by
a
son
of
the
latter
and
by
môri
heirokurô
son
of
môri
awaji
no
kami
this
young
man
was
to
go
to
england
with
the
son
of
sanjô
sanéyoshi
and
young
nakamikado
it
was
expected
they
said
that
the
mikado
would
move
down
to
ozaka
about
the
end
of
the
month
and
remain
there
until
yedo
was
finished
with
keiki
had
sent
an
apology
through
his
relative
echizen
but
it
was
not
considered
satisfactory
and
military
operations
would
be
continued
this
statement
was
not
exact
the
fact
was
as
we
learnt
afterwards
that
captain
du
petit
thouars
commanding
officer
of
the
dupleix
to
which
ship
the
murdered
sailors
belonged
who
had
been
deputed
by
the
french
senior
naval
officer
to
witness
the
execution
with
a
party
of
his
men
finding
that
the
completion
of
the
proceedings
would
involve
the
detention
of
his
men
on
shore
after
dark
raised
his
hand
after
the
eleventh
man
had
suffered
the
nine
whose
lives
were
spared
were
grievously
hurt
we
were
afterwards
told
and
no
wonder
considering
what
the
spirit
of
the
japanese
was
patriotic
death
poems
by
the
men
who
suffered
the
extreme
penalty
were
afterwards
circulated
among
the
people
the
following
are
prose
translations
of
some
of
these
though
i
regret
not
my
body
which
becomes
as
dew
scattered
by
the
wind
my

fate
weighs
down
my
heart
with
anxiety
as
i
also
am
of
the
seed
of
the
country
of
the

i
create
for
myself
a
glorious
subject
for
reflection

the
sacrifice
of

for
the

of
my
country

me
a

heart
in

as
i
am
i
have
not
wandered
from
the
straight
path
of
the
duty
which
a
japanese
owes
to
his

though
reproaches
may
be
cast
upon
me
those
who
can
fathom
the
depths
of
a
warrior
heart
will
appreciate
my
motives
in
this
age
when
the
minds
of
men
are
darkened
i
would
show
the
way
to
purity
of
heart
in
throwing
away
this
life
so
insignificant
a
possession
i
would
desire
to
leave
behind
me
an
unsullied
name
the
cherry
flowers
too
have
their
seasons
of
blossoming
and
fading
what
is
there
for
the
japanese
soul
to
regret
in
death
here
i
leave
my
soul
and
exhibit
to
the
world
the
intrepidity
of
a
japanese
heart
chapter
xxx
kioto
audience
of
the
mikado
on
march
the
whole
legation
crossed
to
ozaka
in
adventure
i
left
my
japanese
escort
behind
as
they
would
have
been
in
the
way
at
kiôto
and
probably
being
tokugawa
retainers
in
fear
of
their
lives
the
whole
time
our
party
slept
at
the
and
next
day
we
rode
up
to
fushimi
escorted
by
komatsu
and
a
couple
of
hizen
officers
one
of
whom
named
nakamuta
was
the
commander
of
the
eugénie
a
steamer
recently
acquired
by
nabéshima
the
party
on
horseback
consisted
of
sir
harry
lieutenant
bradshaw
and
myself
with
the
legation
mounted
escort
we
went
nearly
the
whole
way
at
a
foot
pace
the
road
being
in
fairly
good
condition
but
the
bridges
at
yodo
having
been
burnt
during
the
recent
fighting
we
had
some
difficulty
in
getting
across
the
kidzukawa
which
falls
into
the
river
there
we
got
to
fushimi
about
six
and
found
comfortable
quarters
prepared
for
us
in
the
guest
rooms
of
a
buddhist
monastery
where
we
were
well
looked
after
by
some
hizen
officers
the
rest
of
our
party
together
with
the
infantry
guard
of
the
were
to
come
up
in
boats
starting
at
three
in
the
afternoon
and
travelling
through
the
night
they
gradually
reached
fushimi
next
morning
and
we
managed
to
make
a
start
about
ten
the
first
half
of
the
way
we
were
escorted
by
hizen
men
who
were
then
joined
by
owari
troops
and
here
we
were
met
by
gotô
and
our
cheery
little
friend
nakai
the
streets
were
crowded
with
spectators
who
observed
perfect
order
a
very
fine
buddhist
monastery
at
the
foot
of
had
been
prepared
for
our
accommodation
and
guards
were
posted
consisting
of
higo
awa
and
owari
troops
we
found
the
owari
officials
who
were
in
charge
to
attend
to
our
comforts
very
dilatory
people
and
as
yet
quite
unacquainted
with
foreigners
and
their
requirements
the
apartments
assigned
to
us
were
magnificently
decorated
altogether
in
the
style
of
a
feudal
noble
palace
such
as
we
had
seen
at
tokushima
the
previous
year
shimadzu
osumi
no
kami
father
of
the
prince
of
satsuma
had
occupied
them
for
some
time
when
he
first
visited
kiôto
as
soon
as
we
settled
in
a
grand
feast
of
many
dishes
in
japanese
style
was
served
up
to
us
but
of
course
we
had
brought
our
own
cooks
and
utensils
with
us
for
most
of
us
were
unaccustomed
to
japanese
food
old
yôdô
of
tosa
whom
willis
had
been
attending
was
reported
to
be
out
of
danger
and
in
a
fair
way
of
recovery
the
march
was
spent
by
the
chief
in
making
a
round
of
visits
it
took
the
owari
folk
three
hours
to
get
us
the
necessary
palanquins
and
bearers
we
called
first
on
yamashina
no
miya
who
was
very
affable
and
jolly
his
dirty
beard
shaved
off
and
his
teeth
dyed
black
in
correct
style
he
was
dressed
in
the
costume
called
and
wore
the
tiny
black
lacquered
hat
as
before
the
conversation
turned
upon
the
delightfulness
of
the
occasion
which
had
brought
the
british
minister
to
kiôto
just
after
leaving
the
prince
residence
we
were
stopped
in
the
road
to
let
ninnaji
no
miya
pass
he
was
on
horseback
a
stoutish
swarthy
young
man
with
his
hair
just
beginning
to
sprout
for
until
recently
he
had
been
in
the
buddhist
priesthood
our
next
visit
was
to
sanjô
who
had
had
his
title
of
dainagon
just
restored
to
him
a
pale
undersized
man
of
years
of
age
he
discoursed
very
formally
on
the
happiness
it
gave
to
all
the
court
people
to
see
foreign
ministers
in
kiôto
from
there
we
went
through
the
enclosure
known
as
the
nine
gates
past
the
imperial
palace
it
was
surrounded
by
a
finely
stuccoed
wall
four
feet
thick
at
the
base
with
gates
like
those
of
a
buddhist
temple
very
neatly
thatched
with
small
shingles
iwakura
whom
we
called
on
next
had
his
temporary
residence
just
inside
and
opposite
the
kugé
mon
gate
on
the
west
of
the
palace
he
was
a
oldish
man
but
frank
in
speech
he
told
the
chief
it
was
true
that
the
mikado
and
court
nobles
had
hated
foreigners
hitherto
and
talked
of
while
the
was
all
for
opening
the
country
but
now
that
was
completely
changed
they
had
specially
to
thank
the
english
for
having
been
the
first
to
recognize
the
truth
that
the
mikado
was
the
sovereign
itô
told
me
that
after
we
had
left
the
house
iwakura
expressed
to
him
a
fear
that
he
might
have
given
offence
by
speaking
too
frankly
about
the
former
attitude
of
the
court
towards
foreigners
we
then
went
to
the
hizen
and
saw
the
prince
a
young
man
of
about
years
of
age
he
had
been
appointed
to
the
department
of
foreign
affairs
but
we
would
not
discover
that
he
had
any
great
aptitude
for
official
work
daté
and
luckily
were
not
in
when
we
called
we
also
visited
the
younger
chôshiû
prince
nagato
no
kami
whom
we
easily
recognized
by
his
likeness
to
the
photograph
taken
when
admiral
king
was
in
chôshiû
at
the
other
houses
we
had
been
accommodated
with
chairs
but
here
we
had
to
squat
on
the
floor
in
japanese
fashion
and
when
we
rose
to
leave
it
was
with
difficulty
that
we
could
straighten
our
knee
joints
we
exchanged
with
him
hearty
expressions
of
goodwill
and
congratulations
on
our
ancient
friendship
on
returning
to
we
found
daté
and
gotô
who
had
come
to
discuss
the
details
of
the
audience
that
was
to
take
place
on
the
morrow
they
expressed
much
anxiety
lest
the
mikado
should
find
some
difficulty
in
making
his
speech
to
the
minister
as
he
had
not
up
to
the
present
ever
spoken
to
any
one
but
inmates
of
the
palace
and
it
was
only
ten
days
since
he
had
first
shown
his
face
to
a
so
we
finally
arranged
that
his
majesty
speech
should
be
written
down
that
he
should
try
to
repeat
it
and
then
hand
the
copy
to
yamashina
no
miya
who
would
read
it
out
and
hand
it
to
itô
for
translation
the
document
was
finally
to
remain
in
sir
harry
possession
then
the
latter
would
reply
direct
to
the
mikado
through
itô
acting
as
interpreter
the
only
member
of
the
legation
staff
to
be
admitted
to
the
audience
was
mitford
as
he
alone
had
been
presented
at
court
in
england
he
was
to
be
introduced
by
yamashina
no
miya
and
the
mikado
would
salute
him
with
the
word
which
might
be
freely
rendered
by
glad
to
see
you
the
where
the
audience
was
to
take
place
was
they
told
us
a
large
hall
yards
deep
by
in
length
with
a
floor
of
planking
with
a
dais
and
a
canopy
for
the
mikado
and
another
dais
rather
lower
specially
arranged
for
the
ministers
who
were
received
in
audience
had
we
were
assured
to
kneel
on
the
bare
planks
the
three
foreign
representatives
roches
sir
harry
and
polsbroek
were
to
assemble
in
one
room
and
be
thence
conducted
into
the
presence
of
the
mikado
it
was
now
our
turn
to
suffer
an
assault
at
the
hands
of
the
fanatics
of
patriotism
from
which
our
constant
advocacy
of
the
rights
of
the
sovereign
afforded
us
no
protection
it
was
arranged
that
we
should
start
from
for
the
palace
at
one
on
march
the
procession
was
to
be
headed
by
the
mounted
escort
led
by
inspector
peacock
and
nakai
then
sir
harry
and
gotô
myself
and
lieutenant
bradshaw
the
detachment
of
the
followed
by
willis
enslie
mitford
in
a
palanquin
being
unable
to
ride
and
five
naval
officers
who
had
come
up
with
us
we
descended
the
whole
length
of
the
street
called
nawaté
opposite
to
the
main
gate
of
but
just
as
the
last
file
of
the
mounted
escort
turned
the
corner
to
the
right
a
couple
of
men
sprang
out
from
opposite
sides
of
the
street
drew
their
swords
and
attacked
the
men
and
horses
running
down
the
line
and
hacking
wildly
nakai
observing
what
was
passing
jumped
down
from
his
pony
and
engaged
the
fellow
on
the
right
with
whom
he
had
a
pretty
tough
fight
in
the
struggle
his
feet
got
entangled
in
his
long
loose
trousers
and
he
fell
on
his
back
his
enemy
tried
to
cut
off
his
head
but
nakai
parried
the
blow
receiving
only
a
scalp
wound
and
pierced
the
man
breast
with
the
point
of
his
sword
at
the
same
time
this
sickened
him
and
as
he
was
turning
his
back
on
nakai
he
received
a
blow
on
the
shoulder
from
gotô
sword
which
prostrated
him
on
the
ground
and
nakai
jumping
up
hacked
off
his
head
in
the
meanwhile
the
troopers
on
the
left
had
turned
and
some
of
them
pursued
the
other
villain
who
rushed
down
the
street
from
which
sir
harry
and
i
had
not
yet
emerged
i
had
only
just
arrived
at
a
comprehension
of
what
was
taking
place
my
presence
of
mind
had
deserted
me
and
as
he
passed
my
sole
idea
of
defence
was
to
turn
my
pony
head
round
to
ward
off
the
blow
aimed
at
me
it
was
a
narrow
escape
as
i
afterwards
found
for
the
animal
received
a
slight
cut
on
the
nose
and
was
also
wounded
on
the
shoulder
an
inch
of
two
in
front
of
my
knee
as
soon
as
i
recovered
my
equanimity
i
moved
up
to
the
head
of
the
procession
there
i
saw
sir
harry
parkes
in
his
brilliant
uniform
of
an
envoy
and
minister
calmly
sitting
on
his
horse
in
the
middle
of
the
with
inspector
peacock
close
by
also
on
horseback
and
a
crowd
of
japanese
spectators
the
japanese
infantry
men
of
higo
who
had
led
our
procession
had
disappeared
as
had
also
those
who
had
originally
brought
up
the
rear
but
our
japanese
grooms
stuck
to
us
with
the
greatest
cool
pluck
behind
me
was
the
infantry
guard
of
the
facing
to
the
left
upon
them
he
hurled
himself
cutting
one
man
over
the
head
and
inflicting
a
severe
wound
but
here
his
career
came
to
an
end
for
one
of
the
soldiers
put
out
his
foot
and
tripped
him
up
and
others
drove
their
bayonets
into
him
nevertheless
he
managed
to
get
to
the
end
of
the
line
where
being
stopped
by
mitford
palanquin
he
fled
into
the
courtyard
of
a
house
dropping
his
sword
outside
here
he
was
found
by
bradshaw
who
discharged
a
pistol
at
his
head
but
the
bullet
struck
the
joint
of
the
lower
jaw
and
did
not
penetrate
the
bone
on
this
he
fell
down
in
the
yard
and
became
nearly
insensible
our
wounded
were
too
numerous
to
admit
of
our
proceeding
to
court
nine
of
our
escort
were
wounded
and
one
of
the
guard
besides
nakai
and
sir
harry
japanese
groom
we
therefore
procured
bearers
for
the
palanquins
which
had
been
abandoned
by
their
frightened
porters
and
returned
to
our
quarters
without
any
further
mishap
when
the
wounds
were
examined
it
was
found
that
none
were
in
a
vital
part
though
there
had
been
much
loss
of
blood
a
cut
into
the
knee
of
one
man
and
the
almost
complete
severance
of
the
wrist
of
another
were
the
worst
cases
it
was
a
great
piece
of
good
fortune
that
we
had
such
an
experienced
surgeon
as
willis
with
us
the
captured
assailant
appeared
to
be
a
buddhist
priest
at
least
his
head
was
shaven
assisted
by
a
retainer
of
sanjô
we
examined
him
he
expressed
great
penitence
and
asked
that
his
head
might
be
cut
off
and
exposed
publicly
to
inform
the
japanese
nation
of
his
crime
his
wounds
were
attended
to
by
willis
and
he
was
carefully
deposited
in
the
nakai
brought
the
head
of
the
other
man
back
with
him
and
kept
it
by
his
side
in
a
bucket
as
a
trophy
it
was
a
ghastly
sight
on
the
left
side
of
the
skull
a
terrible
triangular
wound
exposed
the
brain
and
there
was
a
cut
on
the
right
jaw
which
apparently
had
been
dealt
by
the
sword
of
one
of
the
escort

the
incidents
which
befel
us
at

a
very
full
account
of
this
affair
written
by
mitford
to
his
father
was
communicated
to
the
times
and
the
despatch
of

which
the
chief

briefer
narrative
based

in

ii
of
the
history
of
japan
by
adams
as
long
as
we
remained
at
kiôto
i
was
so
busy
with
interpreting
between
the
chief
and
japanese
high
functionaries
and
in
translating
documents
that
my
journal
had
to
be
neglected
and
my
memory
of
what
occurred
over
fifty
years
ago
left
unrecorded
at
the
time
is
scarcely
full
enough
to
afford
material
for
completing
this
chapter
unaided
it
will
readily
be
comprehended
that
this
fanatical
attack
on
the
british
minister
who
had
proved
himself
a
cordial
friend
of
the
imperialist
party
caused
a
feeling
of
utmost
consternation
at
the
court
as
soon
as
the
news
was
received
there
about
four
in
the
afternoon
the
french
minister
and
the
dutch
political
agent
had
punctually
reached
the
palace
where
they
were
kept
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
their
colleague
as
he
failed
to
make
his
appearance
their
reception
was
hurried
through
and
on
leaving
the
audience
chamber
they
received
the
notes
sir
harry
had
sent
off
informing
them
of
what
had
happened
about
six
in
the
evening
there
came
to
him
straight
from
the
court
tokudaiji
echizen
saishô
daté
and
the
prince
of
hizen
to
express
the
deep
regret
of
the
mikado
the
minister
replied
that
he
would
leave
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
the
government
he
considered
that
a
graver
outrage
had
been
committed
upon
the
mikado
than
upon
himself
and
he
felt
assured
that
the
government
would
know
how
to
vindicate
the
honour
of
their
sovereign
they
manifested
a
degree
of
feeling
and
concern
which
showed
that
remonstrance
from
him
was
not
needed
to
make
them
sensible
of
the
gravity
of
the
offence
they
reproached
themselves
for
not
having
taken
better
precautions
for
his
safety
and
deplored
the
disgrace
attaching
to
themselves
for
an
outrage
committed
on
a
foreign
representative
specially
invited
by
the
mikado
to
kiôto
he
added
that
of
course
their
apologies
would
take
a
written
form
but
he
recurred
to
arguments
he
had
previously
addressed
to
various
members
of
the
government
as
to
the
necessity
of
an
enactment
which
should
attach
the
penalty
of
an
ignominious
death
to
all
who
committed
murderous
attacks
on
foreigners
instead
of
allowing
them
to
die
with
credit
by
their
own
hand
as
in
the
case
of
the
eleven
men
who
were
executed
for
the
murder
of
the
french
seamen
at
sakai
he
urged
also
that
the
government
should
make
known
by
public
proclamation
that
his
majesty
really
desired
to
cultivate
friendly
relations
with
foreign
powers
it
was
their
duty
to
eradicate
the
spirit
of
hostility
towards
foreigners
to
which
so
many
had
fallen
victims
and
which
was
fostered
by
the
erroneous
idea
entertained
by
a
certain
class
that
in
attacking
foreigners
they
were
doing
the
mikado
good
service
accordingly
the
written
apology
was
delivered
next
day
together
with
a
copy
of
the
sentence
depriving
the
prisoner
of
his
rank
as
and
passing
a
sentence
of
decapitation
on
him
sanjô
iwakura
tokudaiji
and
other
ministers
called
to
offer
their
regrets
and
promised
that
the
proclamation
should
be
posted
on
the
public
which
were
a
feature
in
every
town
and
village
they
offered
also
in
case
any
of
our
wounded
should
die
or
be
deprived
of
their
livelihood
by
inability
to
perform
their
duties
to
provide
suitable
compensation
this
affair
having
been
satisfactorily
disposed
of
the
chief
agreed
to
have
an
audience
of
the
mikado
which
took
place
on
march
of
course
we
were
not
able
to
make
such
a
show
as
on
the
since
most
of
the
mounted
escort
were
incapacitated
by
the
severity
of
their
wounds
on
the
other
hand
extraordinary
precautions
were
taken
for
the
security
of
the
party
in
passing
along
the
streets
as
had
previously
been
arranged
of
the
legation
staff
only
mitford
was
presented
the
minister
and
he
ascended
the
shishinden
by
steps
at
the
north
end
entered
by
the
door
on
the
south
and
issuing
from
it
after
the
audience
descended
by
steps
at
the
south
end
those
of
us
like
willis
and
myself
and
the
other
members
of
our
party
walked
through
the
courtyard
past
the
hall
of
audience
and
rejoined
them
as
they
came
down
again
the
mikado
was
the
first
to
speak
and
his
speech
ran
as
follows
i
hope
your
sovereign
enjoys
good
health
i
trust
that
the
intercourse
between
our
respective
countries
will
become
more
and
more
friendly
and
be
permanently
established
i
regret
deeply
that
an
unfortunate
affair
which
took
place
as
you
were
proceeding
to
the
palace
on
the
instant
has
delayed
this
ceremony
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
therefore
to
see
you
here
to
this
the
minister
made
the
following
reply
sire
her
majesty
the
queen
is
in
the
enjoyment
of
good
health
i
shall
have
great
pleasure
in
reporting
to
my
government
your
majesty
inquiries
and
assurances
of
friendship
the
condition
of
the
foreign
relations
of
a
state
must
ever
be
dependent
upon
its
internal
stability
and
progress
and
your
majesty
is
taking
the
best
measures
to
place
the
foreign
relations
of
japan
upon
a
permanent
footing
by
establishing
a
strong
general
government
throughout
your
majesty
dominions
and
by
adopting
the
system
of
international
law
universally
recognized
by
other
states
i
am
deeply
sensible
of
the
manner
in
which
your
majesty
has
been
pleased
to
notice
the
attack
made
upon
me
on
the
instant
and
i
appreciate
the
exertions
of
your
majesty
ministers
on
that
unfortunate
occasion
the
memory
of
it
will
be
effaced
by
the
gracious
reception
which
your
majesty
has
given
me
this
day
the
foreign
representatives
left
kiôto
the
following
day
saegusa
shigéru
the
captive
of
our
bow
and
spear
on
the
was
executed
that
morning
three
supposed
accomplices
before
the
fact
were
sentenced
to
perpetual
exile
but
we
were
never
convinced
of
their
guilt
if
it
had
been
proved
against
them
they
ought
to
have
suffered
the
same
penalty
but
the
chief
did
not
care
to
press
the
point
it
was
sir
harry
wish
that
i
should
remain
at
ozaka
to
keep
up
communication
with
the
court
but
i
persuaded
him
to
leave
mitford
there
for
the
purpose
two
motives
actuated
me
i
wished
to
get
back
to
my
newly
acquired
house
at
yedo
and
mitford
knew
much
more
than
i
did
about
english
parliamentary
institutions
which
was
a
subject
in
which
the
leaders
of
the
class
at
kiôto
and
especially
gotô
shôjirô
were
greatly
interested
for
their
hope
was
to
base
the
new
government
of
japan
on
a
representative
system
chapter
xxxi
return
to
yedo
and
presentation
of
the
new
credentials
at
ozaka
on
march
i
arrived
back
at
yokohama
with
the
chief
and
went
up
to
yedo
on
april
to
find
out
what
was
the
state
of
things
there
i
took
noguchi
and
my
six
japanese
escort
men
with
me
the
latter
were
lodged
in
a
building
by
the
gate
of
my
house
my
chief
source
of
information
was
katsu
awa
no
kami
who
had
been
the
head
of
the
tokugawa
navy
to
avoid
exciting
attention
i
used
to
visit
him
after
dark
the
van
of
the
imperialist
army
had
already
arrived
in
the
neighbourhood
of
yedo
the
advanced
posts
being
at
shinagawa
shinjiku
and
itabashi
slight
skirmishes
with
detached
bodies
of
disbanded
yedo
troops
had
taken
place
on
the
kôshiû
and
kisô
roads
which
had
delayed
the
arrival
of
the
imperial
forces
for
a
day
or
two
small
parties
of
satsuma
and
chôshiû
men
wandered
about
the
streets
of
the
city
unmolested
and
a
smaller
satsuma
near
our
legation
was
on
march
by
a
few
soldiers
of
that
clan
arisugawa
no
miya
the
was
reported
to
be
still
at
numadzu
half
a
day
journey
west
of
the
top
of
the
hakoné
pass
keiki
was
residing
in
retirement
at
the
tokugawa
mausoleum
of
uyéno
straining
every
effort
to
keep
his
retainers
in
a
submissive
temper
towards
the
mikado
by
means
of
notifications
to
the
people
and
a
body
of
armed
police
already
as
early
as
march
a
proclamation
had
been
issued
declaring
that
the
was
determined
to
submit
to
any
orders
which
might
be
given
to
him
by
the
mikado
and
that
no
opposition
was
to
be
offered
to
the
imperial
troops
aidzu
and
his
clansmen
had
retired
to
their
home
at
wakamatsu
in
oshiû
after
dismantling
all
the
clan
establishments
in
yedo
nearly
all
the
other
who
had
been
residing
in
yedo
until
recently
had
either
returned
to
their
territories
or
gone
to
kiôto
to
give
in
their
allegiance
to
the
mikado
the
or
retainers
of
tokugawa
below
the
rank
of
were
daily
following
their
example
the
people
of
the
city
ignorant
of
the
demands
about
to
be
made
on
keiki
and
mindful
of
the
misfortunes
some
of
them
had
experienced
when
the
satsuma
were
attacked
in
the
previous
december
were
apprehensive
of
a
general
conflagration
some
had
removed
their
household
property
but
the
shops
were
still
open
and
the
panic
was
by
no
means
general
the
forts
in
the
bay
of
yedo
were
handed
over
to
the
imperialists
on
april
after
the
guns
bearing
on
the
city
had
been
dismounted
this
was
the
news
on
the
on
the
i
went
up
again
for
a
three
days
stay
and
found
the
city
much
quieter
owing
to
a
feeling
that
the
terms
offered
to
keiki
would
be
such
as
he
could
accept
katsu
who
was
now
of
the
tokugawa
forces
told
me
that
he
and
okubo
ichiô
had
charge
of
the
negotiations
on
the
other
side
saigô
represented
arisugawa
no
miya
the
imperialist
who
was
still
at
sumpu
the
demands
made
on
keiki
were
that
he
should
surrender
all
arms
and
munitions
of
war
all
vessels
of
war
and
other
steamers
evacuate
the
castle
of
yedo
and
execute
those
of
his
officers
who
had
been
foremost
in
prompting
and
conducting
the
attack
on
fushimi
when
these
demands
were
complied
with
the
mikado
would
show
clemency
towards
the
the
nature
of
the
further
conditions
covered
by
the
word
clemency
was
the
subject
of
negotiations
between
katsu
and
saigô
which
took
place
at
a
house
in
shinagawa
katsu
was
willing
to
agree
to
any
arrangement
that
would
save
the
life
of
his
chief
and
secure
sufficient
revenue
to
support
his
large
body
of
retainers
he
had
hinted
to
saigô
that
less
favourable
terms
would
be
met
by
armed
resistance
keiki
also
desired
to
retain
possession
of
his
steamers
and
munitions
of
war
and
had
addressed
a
petition
to
the
mikado
on
this
subject
saigô
carrying
this
petition
and
katsu
verbal
proposals
had
returned
to
sumpu
to
lay
them
before
arisugawa
from
there
he
had
journeyed
to
kiôto
but
was
expected
back
on
the
katsu
said
he
was
ready
to
fight
in
defence
of
keiki
life
and
expressed
his
confidence
in
saigô
ability
to
prevent
a
demand
being
made
which
might
not
only
be
a
disgrace
to
the
mikado
but
prolong
the
civil
war
he
begged
that
sir
harry
parkes
would
use
his
influence
with
the
mikado
government
to
obviate
such
a
disaster
this
the
chief
did
repeatedly
and
in
particular
when
saigô
called
on
him
at
yokohama
on
april
he
urged
on
him
that
severity
towards
keiki
or
his
supporters
especially
in
the
way
of
personal
punishment
would
injure
the
reputation
of
the
new
government
in
the
opinion
of
european
powers
saigô
said
the
life
of
the
would
not
be
demanded
and
he
hoped
that
similar
leniency
would
be
extended
to
those
who
had
instigated
him
to
march
against
kiôto
keiki
was
still
at
the
monastery
at
uyéno
but
some
of
his
late
advisers
whom
he
had
ordered
into
strict
seclusion
had
secretly
fled
amongst
these
katsu
mentioned
ogasawara
late
chief
minister
for
foreign
affairs
hirayama
whom
we
used
to
call
the
old
fox
tsukahara
an
official
whom
we
greatly
liked
and
oguri
kôdzuké
no
suké
a
finance
minister
the
most
remarkable
statement
katsu
made
to
me
was
that
at
a
conference
between
the
ministers
and
roches
in
february
the
latter
strongly
urged
resistance
and
that
the
officers
of
the
french
military
mission
were
persistent
in
advising
the
fortification
of
the
hakoné
pass
and
other
measures
of
a
warlike
nature
on
the
whole
katsu
was
of
opinion
that
he
and
okubo
ichiô
would
be
able
to
arrange
satisfactory
terms
if
they
could
manage
to
escape
the
of
their
own
party
who
were
threatening
their
lives
by
this
time
the
first
division
of
the
imperialist
naval
force
had
arrived
to
with
the
army
which
had
advanced
by
land
there
seemed
to
be
little
likelihood
of
fighting
but
even
a
peaceable
settlement
would
be
disadvantageous
to
the
prosperity
of
the
city
now
that
the
whose
wants
had
been
supplied
by
the
merchants
and
shopkeepers
had
left
for
their
country
homes
the
population
would
naturally
decrease
it
was
a
sad
thing
that
yedo
should
decline
for
it
was
one
of
the
handsomest
cities
in
the
far
east
though
it
contained
no
fine
public
buildings
its
position
on
the
seashore
fringed
with
the
pleasure
gardens
of
the
and
the
remarkable
huge
moats
surrounding
the
castle
crowned
with
cyclopean
walls
and
shaded
by
picturesque
lines
of
the
numerous
rural
spots
in
the
city
itself
all
contributed
to
produce
an
impression
of
greatness
it
covered
a
huge
extent
of
ground
owing
to
the
size
of
the
castle
and
the
large
number
of
official
residences
intersected
by
fine
broad
streets
the
commercial
quarter
was
actually
smaller
than
the
city
of
ozaka
newspapers
to
a
large
extent
in
the
nature
of
gazettes
had
lately
been
started
in
kiôto
and
yedo
and
contained
a
great
number
of
interesting
political
documents
which
i
had
to
translate
for
the
information
of
my
chief
previously
we
had
been
obliged
to
rely
on
such
manuscript
copies
as
we
could
obtain
from
our
friends
in
and
the
supply
was
limited
nor
were
the
papers
that
came
into
our
hands
altogether
trustworthy
there
was
as
much
forgery
of
memorials
manifestoes
and
correspondence
as
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
in
a
time
of
political
excitement
there
were
rumours
about
this
time
that
the
capital
would
be
transferred
from
kiôto
to
ozaka
an
arrangement
we
felt
inclined
to
welcome
for
it
would
have
been
very
inconvenient
to
establish
the
foreign
legations
at
kiôto
so
far
inland
and
away
from
our
sources
of
supply
subject
to
great
cold
in
winter
and
excessive
heat
in
summer
even
at
ozaka
close
to
the
sea
the
climate
was
almost
unbearable
in
july
and
august
but
as
everyone
knows
yedo
was
after
all
constituted
the
centre
of
government
and
its
name
changed
to
tôkiô
during
this
period
my
time
was
passed
half
at
yedo
gathering
information
and
half
at
yokohama
making
translations
and
drawing
up
reports
bread
and
beef
were
unprocurable
at
yedo
and
i
could
not
afford
to
set
up
a
cuisine
in
european
fashion
so
while
there
i
used
to
have
my
food
brought
in
from
a
japanese
restaurant
close
by
and
came
to
like
it
quite
as
well
as
what
i
had
been
accustomed
to
all
my
life
as
early
as
the
end
of
november
sir
harry
had
applied
to
lord
stanley
for
letters
of
credence
to
the
mikado
no
time
was
wasted
in
their
preparation
and
despatch
and
they
reached
him
at
the
end
of
march
but
it
was
not
till
the
middle
of
may
that
things
had
quieted
down
at
yokohama
sufficiently
to
allow
of
his
leaving
that
part
of
the
country
by
that
time
sidney
locock
and
his
family
had
left
for
home
and
his
successor
francis
ottiwell
adams
had
arrived
we
started
from
yokohama
in
the
admiral
yacht
salamis
on
may
sir
harry
adams
quin
the
senior
student
interpreter
and
myself
next
afternoon
we
anchored
in
the
harbour
of
oshima
between
the
island
of
that
name
and
the
southernmost
point
of
the
province
of
kii
on
a
neck
of
land
there
was
a
small
village
very
dirty
stinking
and
labyrinthine
surrounded
by
prettily
wooded
hills
where
we
started
several
pheasants
in
the
course
of
a
walk
at
dusk
we
weighed
anchor
and
reached
hiôgo
at
nine
the
next
morning
where
we
found
ocean
and
zebra
already
in
harbour
we
had
passed
rodney
the
flagship
of
admiral
sir
harry
keppel
on
the
way
up
the
kii
channel
these
ships
were
assembled
off
ozaka
to
give
to
the
presentation
of
the
first
letter
of
an
european
sovereign
to
the
rightful
sovereign
of
japan
we
got
to
the
ozaka
bar
about
noon
and
afterwards
adams
quin
and
i
went
ashore
with
the
baggage
the
chief
did
not
land
until
the
when
a
salute
was
fired
from
the
fort
in
his
honour
we
then
became
busily
occupied
with
the
arrangements
for
the
presentation
of
the
minister
credentials
of
his
staff
and
a
large
number
of
naval
officers
we
took
up
our
quarters
at
the
for
the
sake
of
convenience
in
communicating
with
the
squadron
outside
the
bar
the
was
fixed
on
as
the
day
for
the
ceremony
then
the
credentials
had
to
be
translated
into
japanese
and
the
number
of
officers
to
be
presented
had
to
be
agreed
upon
i
had
to
be
present
much
to
my
annoyance
for
i
possessed
no
diplomatic
uniform
the
chief
offered
me
the
loan
of
a
sort
of
staff
jacket
of
blue
serge
fastened
in
front
with
frogs
and
an
old
pair
of
trousers
with
gold
lace
down
the
sides
but
i
put
them
away
in
a
cupboard
and
went
to
court
in
plain
evening
dress
as
soon
as
sir
harry
landed
he
was
visited
by
gotô
one
of
the
two
who
had
fought
in
our
defence
at
kiôto
on
the
march
and
by
daté
with
the
latter
we
had
a
discussion
about
the
recently
published
edict
against
christianity
it
revived
the
ancient
prohibition
but
in
less
stringent
terms
daté
admitted
that
the
wording
was
objectionable
and
said
that
he
had
caused
it
not
to
be
exhibited
on
the
public
at
ozaka
and
hiôgo
he
had
tried
to
get
the
expression
translated
evil
or
pernicious
sect
altered
but
said
it
would
be
impossible
to
suppress
the
proscription
of
christianity
altogether
sir
harry
responded
that
religious
toleration
was
a
mark
of
civilization
and
to
us
he
said
privately
that
the
presentation
of
the
queen
letter
was
a
good
opportunity
which
we
ought
to
turn
to
account
afterwards
i
had
a
long
talk
with
nakai
on
this
subject
and
suggested
that
instead
of
specifically
mentioning
christianity
the
decree
should
merely
forbid
pernicious
sects
in
general
it
was
clear
that
the
japanese
government
would
not
be
induced
to
revoke
the
law
completely
for
that
would
be
to
give
a
free
hand
to
the
roman
catholic
missionaries
at
nagasaki
who
had
already
made
themselves
obnoxious
by
the
active
manner
in
which
they
had
carried
on
their
proselytism
it
was
however
agreed
that
sir
harry
should
meet
sanjô
daté
gotô
and
kido
on
the
following
day
to
dispose
if
possible
of
this
question
but
nakai
warned
me
that
not
even
the
heads
of
the
government
could
make
a
definite
promise
they
were
not
absolute
as
he
said
so
on
the
we
had
a
palaver
at
the
nishi
hongwanji
at
which
yamashina
no
miya
the
president
of
the
foreign
board
was
present
besides
those
already
mentioned
and
several
more
they
defended
what
had
been
done
on
the
ground
that
the
hostility
to
christianity
was
still
intense
and
that
in
popular
opinion
it
was
allied
to
magic
or
sorcery
this
i
knew
myself
to
be
a
fact
i
had
once
been
asked
by
a
japanese
to
teach
him
kiristan
which
he
believed
would
enable
him
to
discover
what
his
wife
was
doing
in
his
absence
from
the
house
they
admitted
however
that
an
error
had
been
committed
in
describing
christianity
as
a
pernicious
sect
and
said
that
this
wording
would
be
altered
to
have
published
nothing
would
have
been
tantamount
to
toleration
silent
approval
as
the
japanese
expression
goes
and
upon
this
they
could
not
venture
on
the
sir
harry
recurred
to
the
subject
with
the
same
set
of
ministers
with
whom
iwakura
was
joined
perhaps
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
a
young
of
hizen
okuma
hachitarô
whom
we
had
not
met
before
assured
us
that
he
knew
all
about
the
subject
for
he
had
read
the
bible
and
the
it
appeared
that
he
had
been
a
pupil
of
dr
verbeck
an
american
missionary
at
nagasaki
sir
harry
gave
them
a
copy
and
a
japanese
version
of
a
despatch
on
this
subject
which
had
been
received
from
lord
stanley
the
other
foreign
diplomats
took
the
same
line
but
their
united
remonstrances
produced
little
effect
and
the
measure
of
exiling
to
other
parts
of
the
country
some
four
thousand
japanese
of
all
ages
and
both
sexes
mostly
from
the
village
of
urakami
near
nagasaki
was
unflinchingly
carried
out
the
presentation
of
the
minister
letters
of
credence
took
place
on
the
admiral
keppel
landed
in
the
morning
accompanied
by
his
heneage
and
captain
stanhope
of
the
ocean
commander
pollard
and
lieutenant
kerr
in
command
of
a
gunboat
pusey
commander
of
the
salamis
his
secretary
william
risk
and
garnier
and
joined
us
at
the
the
legation
party
included
the
chief
adams
mitford
who
had
just
been
gazetted
second
secretary
and
myself
our
procession
consisted
of
a
hundred
marines
from
rodney
and
the
same
number
from
ocean
twelve
palanquins
in
which
such
of
us
rode
as
had
legs
flexible
enough
four
of
the
legation
escort
on
foot
and
two
bodies
of
japanese
troops
who
preceded
and
followed
us
we
arrived
punctually
at
one
at
the
nishi
hongwanji
assigned
for
the
performance
of
the
ceremony
the
theory
of
the
mikado
presence
at
ozaka
was
that
he
was
at
the
head
of
the
army
operating
from
kiôto
against
the
rebellious
tokugawa
chief
at
yedo
and
he
was
therefore
obliged
to
put
up
with
such
accommodation
as
he
could
find
in
the
buddhist
monasteries
which
were
not
very
imperial
in
their
appointments
we
were
ushered
into
an
which
was
merely
a
part
of
the
hall
of
audience
divided
off
by
screens
down
the
middle
ran
a
long
table
covered
with
cloth
of
gold
about
the
only
piece
of
splendour
in
the
place
on
one
side
of
this
we
took
our
seats
the
japanese
ministers
for
foreign
affairs
on
the
other
tea
and
sweetmeats
piled
on
wooden
trays
were
brought
in
for
our
refection
and
we
had
to
wait
about
before
the
chief
of
the
ministry
entered
the
room
and
made
the
polite
speeches
necessary
on
such
an
occasion
in
a
few
minutes
more
we
were
informed
that
everything
was
ready
whereupon
the
second
and
third
ministers
proceeded
to
usher
us
into
the
throne
room
this
was
an
apartment
of
considerable
size
down
each
side
of
which
there
ran
a
row
of
wooden
pillars
supporting
the
roof
on
a
dais
at
the
extreme
end
sat
the
mikado
under
a
canopy
supported
by
poles
and
with
the
blinds
rolled
up
as
high
as
was
possible
we
advanced
up
the
middle
of
the
room
in
double
column
the
one
on
the
right
headed
by
the
admiral
and
composed
of
naval
officers
the
other
headed
by
the
minister
and
consisting
of
the
legation
staff
everyone
made
three
bows
first
on
advancing
into
the
middle
of
the
room
the
second
at
the
foot
of
the
dais
the
third
on
mounting
the
dais
which
was
large
enough
to
afford
place
for
us
all
the
mikado
rose
and
stood
under
the
canopy
from
the
moment
that
we
began
to
bow
the
principal
minister
for
foreign
affairs
and
one
other
great
personage
knelt
one
on
each
side
of
the
throne
in
front
of
the
throne
on
each
side
stood
a
small
wooden
image
of
a
lion
these
are
of
great
antiquity
and
are
much
revered
by
the
japanese
people
behind
the
throne
a
crowd
of
courtiers
were
ranged
in
a
double
row
wearing
little
black
paper
caps
and
gorgeous
brocade
robes
of
various
hues
as
the
mikado
stood
up
the
upper
part
of
his
face
including
the
eyes
became
hidden
from
view
but
i
saw
the
whole
of
it
whenever
he
moved
his
complexion
was
white
perhaps
artificially
so
rendered
his
mouth
badly
formed
what
a
doctor
would
call
prognathous
but
the
general
contour
was
good
his
eyebrows
were
shaven
off
and
painted
in
an
inch
higher
up
his
costume
consisted
of
a
long
black
loose
cape
hanging
backwards
a
white
upper
garment
or
mantle
and
voluminous
purple
trousers
the
proceedings
were
as
follows
the
minister
stood
in
front
of
the
mikado
right
with
the
legation
behind
him
in
order
of
seniority
the
admiral
with
his
personal
staff
and
the
other
naval
officers
on
the
imperial
left
sir
harry
then
recited
his
address
which
he
had
got
by
heart
it
seemed
truly
absurd
when
one
at
last
stood
face
to
face
with
the
recipient
then
itô
who
discharged
the
functions
of
interpreter
on
the
occasion
read
the
translation
and
we
all
bowed
sir
harry
stepping
forward
put
the
queen
letter
into
the
hand
of
the
mikado
who
evidently
felt
bashful
or
timid
and
had
to
be
assisted
by
yamashina
no
miya
his
part
was
to
receive
it
from
the
mikado
then
his
majesty
forgot
his
speech
but
catching
a
word
from
the
personage
on
his
left
managed
to
get
out
the
first
sentence
whereupon
itô
read
out
the
translation
of
the
whole
that
had
been
prepared
beforehand
sir
harry
then
introduced
each
of
us
in
turn
and
next
the
admiral
who
presented
his
officers
the
mikado
expressed
the
hope
that
all
was
well
with
the
squadron
under
his
command
and
we
retired
backwards
out
of
the
presence
into
the
bowing
as
we
went
and
congratulating
ourselves
that
everything
had
passed
off
without
a
hitch
in
the
evening
we
went
to
dine
with
daté
who
gave
us
a
banquet
cooked
as
nearly
in
european
fashion
as
he
could
manage
next
day
we
celebrated
the
queen
birthday
in
advance
by
firing
salutes
and
a
large
party
of
japanese
nobles
went
on
board
the
rodney
to
lunch
with
the
admiral
yamashina
no
miya
proposed
the
queen
health
which
was
responded
to
enthusiastically
by
everyone
present
many
of
the
guests
were
intelligent
and
well
behaved
but
the
prince
of
chôshiû
who
insisted
on
my
sitting
next
to
him
behaved
like
a
great
baby
and
drank
more
champagne
than
was
good
for
him
one
felt
however
that
japanese
princes
could
not
be
blamed
if
they
were
their
education
being
planned
so
as
to
produce
that
result
the
son
of
the
maternal
uncle
was
possessed
with
a
huge
desire
to
see
an
european
cat
while
another
great
man
wanted
to
get
sight
of
a
negro
and
we
had
great
difficulty
in
satisfying
their
wishes
the
principal
minister
for
foreign
affairs
who
had
of
course
to
be
saluted
desired
that
as
little
powder
as
possible
should
be
used
because
the
sound
of
a
violent
explosion
hurt
his
ears
one
of
the
great
attractions
was
the
rodney
band
which
played
a
great
deal
of
noisy
music
for
the
benefit
of
the
admiral
guests
and
the
bandmaster
of
the
ocean
gained
great
applause
by
composing
a
march
and
a
japanese
national
anthem
which
he
dedicated
to
the
mikado
the
conference
held
at
ozaka
on
the
following
day
a
sunday
at
which
among
other
things
the
christian
question
was
discussed
lasted
for
six
hours
and
that
meant
six
hours
for
me
of
interpreting
from
english
into
japanese
and
from
japanese
into
english
so
it
was
a
certain
amount
of
relief
to
me
when
on
the
we
reembarked
on
board
the
salamis
to
return
to
yokohama
the
mikado
left
ozaka
on
the
and
returned
to
kiôto
the
submission
of
the
being
held
to
justify

adams

set
up

together

but
i
still
kept
on

i
had
rented
at

spent
a
great
deal
of
time
there
watching
the

from
time
to
time
i
returned
to
yokohama
to
report
to
my
chief
or
else
reported
to
him
by
letter
i
was
very
busily
occupied
in
making
translations
from
the
official
gazette
that
was
now
being
published
at
kiôto
and
the
popular
newspapers
that
had
started
into
existence
at
yedo
one
of
these
contained
documents
of
the
highest
interest
the
terms
communicated
to
keiki
on
april
the
acceptance
of
which
by
him
involved
his
retirement
to

the
provisional
recognition
of

as
the

moved
freely
about
the
city
on
june
i
went
up
to
yedo
for
a
three
days
stay
with
adams
i
found
there
in
the
local
papers
interesting
communications
which
were
probably
fictitious
thus
one
said
to
be
written
by
a
retainer
of
the
miya
of
where
the
british
legation
had
been
lodged
in
march
who
though
regarding
the
expulsion
of
foreigners
as
perhaps
difficult
of
achievement
recommended
that
the
organization
of
the
army
be
diligently
taken
in
hand
in
order
that
foreigners
might
be
humbled
and
kept
in
subjection
he
also
deprecated
audiences
being
granted
by
the
mikado
to
foreign
diplomatic
representatives
another
such
paper
professed
to
represent
the
views
of
chôshiû
irregular
troops
and
protested
against
audiences
being
granted
because
such
friendly
treatment
of
foreigners
would
prevent
the
nation
from
affording
hearty
support
to
the
mikado
when
the
time
should
arrive
for
expelling
the
barbarian
when
i
mentioned
these
publications
to
my
friend
katsu
he
replied
that
a
council
of
court
and
territorial
nobles
and
was
held
at
kiôto
about
the
end
of
may
at
which
the
former
expressed
the
opinion
that
a
favourable
occasion
for
expelling
foreigners
from
the
country
had
now
presented
itself
their
attempt
to
introduce
christianity
at
nagasaki
might
be
alleged
as
the
justifying
ground
of
the
measure
that
the
were
silent
and
that
the
mikado
on
being
referred
to
took
no
notice
of
the
proposal
katsu
was
not
very
accurately
informed
but
it
is
a
fact
that
on
may
the
principal
members
of
the
government
and
in
attendance
on
the
mikado
at
ozaka
were
summoned
before
his
majesty
at
the
hongwanji
and
were
informed
that
christianity
was
on
the
increase
at
urakami
a
village
near
nagasaki
he
asked
for
their
opinion
as
to
the
best
way
of
dealing
with
the
matter
and
it
was
understood
that
their
replies
would
be
published
in
the
government
gazette
daté
denied
to
mitford
that
part
of
the
story
which
said
that
the
meeting
was
for
the
purpose
of
considering
whether
an
policy
might
not
be
resorted
to
it
was
difficult
for
us
to
obtain
accurate
information
and
probably
every
japanese
in
the
position
of
katsu
or
daté
experienced
similar
difficulty
i
do
not
think
however
that
these
documents
ever
saw
the
light
and
the
suggestion
is
very
natural
that
some
of
them
were
of
such
a
character
that
it
was
considered
advisable
to
suppress
them
the
formal
appointment
of
kaménosuké
a
mere
boy
of
six
years
of
age
took
place
on
june
and
the
leading
men
of
the
tokugawa
clan
waited
on
him
the
following
morning
to
present
their
felicitations
the
situation
and
extent
of
the
territory
to
be
left
to
the
clan
had
not
then
been
determined
katsu
told
me
that
sanjô
who
had
arrived
in
yedo
on
the
was
waiting
for
the
reinforcements
expected
from
the
south
and
west
before
announcing
a
decision
on
these
points
he
gave
me
such
statistics
about
the
revenue
hitherto
accruing
to
the
tycoon
government
as
showed
to
his
satisfaction
at
least
that
it
would
not
be
possible
for
the
mikado
to
derive
any
income
from
forfeiture
of
that
revenue
and
there
was
danger
of
his
government
falling
to
pieces
for
want
of
funds
who
was
then
in
yedo
said
to
me
that
the
revenue
to
be
granted
to
the
tokugawa
would
not
be
fixed
until
that
part
of
the
clan
still
in
arms
against
the
mikado
was
entirely
reduced
to
submission
the
war
was
being
vigorously
prosecuted
near
niigata
in
echigo
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
aidzu
i
myself
saw
a
considerable
body
of
southern
troops
march
into
yedo
on
june
which
effectually
contradicted
the
hopes
of
the
tokugawa
people
that
the
imperialists
were
weakening
and
that
some
of
the
western
clans
in
particular
higo
were
likely
to
afford
them
sympathy
if
not
actual
support
roches
finally
left
yokohama
on
june
having
been
succeeded
by
outrey
with
the
intention
of
visiting
ozaka
and
nagasaki
on
his
way
home
his
policy
had
proved
a
complete
failure
as
far
as
supporting
the
shôgun
against
the
mikado
was
concerned
he
had
succeeded
however
in
procuring
for
french
engineers
the
construction
of
the
arsenal
at
yokosuka
and
the
engagement
of
a
french
military
mission
which
were
continued
for
several
years
after
the
establishment
of
the
new
government
noguchi
had
an
elder
and
a
younger
brother
the
latter
of
whom
had
joined
the
followers
of
the
tokugawa
who
after
the
withdrawal
of
keiki
to
mito
had
gathered
themselves
together
in
the
mausoleum
enclosure
at
uyéno
thence
they
issued
forth
at
night
and
assassinated
imperialist
soldiers
from
time
to
time
at
last
it
was
decided
to
attack
them
in
their
stronghold
and
early
in
the
morning
of
july
an
advance
was
made
which
led
to
the
destruction
by
fire
of
a
considerable
part
of
the
city
lying
between
the
outer
moat
and
the
main
gate
of
uyéno
and
also
of
the
great
temple
building
which
occupied
the
centre
of
the
enclosure
the
burial
places
of
the
shôguns
were
not
damaged
rinôji
no
miya
the
imperial
prince
who
had
always
resided
there
in
the
character
of
abbot
and
whom
the
recalcitrant
tokugawa
men
talked
of
raising
to
the
throne
as
mikado
was
carried
off
by
the
survivors
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
fighting
began
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
was
over
by
five
in
the
evening
during
this
affair
i
was
at
yokohama
having
been
kept
there
since
my
last
visit
to
yedo
at
the
end
of
june
at
the
beginning
of
that
month
willis
and
i
were
in
yedo
together
for
a
few
days
while
he
attended
to
wounded
men
of
the
satsuma
and
other
clans
such
as
toda
chôshiû
and
bizen
the
latter
occupied
tôzenji
which
had
formerly
been
the
british
legation
and
he
recorded
in
his
report
the
fact
of
his
being
received
and
treated
by
the
bizen
men
with
great
courtesy
which
showed
that
they
entertained
no
feelings
of
hostility
against
foreigners
and
regarded
the
death
of
taki
zenzaburô
as
a
just
retribution
for
the
attack
on
foreigners
at
kôbé
in
the
previous
february
the
condition
of
these
wounded
men
was
deplorable
for
at
that
time
japan
had
no
experienced
surgeons
and
the
treatment
of
gunshot
wounds
was
of
a
very
amateurish
character
there
were
but
few
cases
of
subsequently
some
of
the
more
urgent
cases
were
at
suggestion
sent
down
to
yokohama
and
towards
the
end
of
july
there
were
patients
in
the
building
appropriated
as
a
military
hospital
under
the
previous
government
it
had
been
a
school
for
instruction
in
the
chinese
classics
of
the
number
were
satsuma
men
chôshiû
and
tosa
soldiers
together
made
up
a
fourth
about
had
been
wounded
in
the
recent
fighting
at
uyéno
the
others
had
received
their
injuries
in
the
expeditions
to
the
north
of
yedo
against
aidzu
willis
services
were
so
greatly
appreciated
that
the
minister
was
asked
in
october
to
lend
them
again
to
the
troops
which
had
been
fighting
in
echigo
this
arrangement
was
facilitated
by
the
fact
that
he
was
now
at
yedo
a
post
which
he
was
unable
to
take
up
because
the
opening
of
the
city
to
foreign
residence
and
trade
had
to
be
deferred
and
he
was
relieved
at
yokohama
by
dr
j
siddall
who
had
been
appointed
medical
officer
to
the
legation
early
in
january
on
the
july
i
went
to
yedo
with
adams
and
spent
four
days
in
visiting
okuma
katsu
and
komatsu
but
though
i
must
have
reported
to
my
chief
the
result
of
the
conversation
with
these
persons
of
importance
i
have
no
record
except
of
voluminous
translations
from
the
japanese
of
pamphlets
and
political
documents
of
all
kinds
i
went
alone
to
yedo
again
on
august
and
next
day
called
on
okuma
whom
i
found
in
bed
looking
very
from
him
i
learnt
that
fighting
had
commenced
on
the
at
imaichi
near
nikkô
the
imperialists
were
victorious
and
were
still
advancing
on
aidzu
miles
further
a
messenger
who
left
echigo
on
the
reported
that
niigata
was
still
held
by
aidzu
men
subsequently
to
the
capture
of
nagaoka
by
the
imperial
troops
more
fighting
had
taken
place
in
which
both
sides
lost
heavily
the
imperialists
were
holding
their
ground
and
expected
further
reinforcements
which
would
enable
them
to
advance
on
wakamatsu
the
capital
of
aidzu
at
the
same
time
as
the
divisions
from
shirakawa
and
akita
the
prince
of
hizen
okuma
own
chief
had
been
urged
by
his
troops
in
shimotsuké
where
imaichi
is
situated
to
lead
them
against
the
enemy
but
his
councillors
had
dissuaded
him
from
taking
the
field
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
several
constitutions
had
been
framed
and
issued
one
after
the
other
and
about
this
time
i
was
engaged
in
translating
the
newest
edition
which
bore
the
date
of
june
it
showed
marked
traces
of
american
political
theories
and
i
have
little
doubt
that
okuma
and
his
soyéjima
pupils
of
dr
verbeck
had
had
a
considerable
part
in
framing
it
the
power
and
authority
of
the
government
threefold
legislative
executive
and
judicial
was
the
wording
of
one
article
by
another
it
was
provided
that
all
officers
shall
be
changed
after
four
service
they
shall
be
appointed
by
a
majority
of
votes
given
by
ballot
when
the
first
period
for
changing
the
officers
of
government
arrives
half
of
the
present
staff
shall
be
retained
for
an
additional
space
of
two
years
in
order
that
there
be
no
interruption
of
the
public
business
in
this
we
seemed
to
hear
an
echo
of
the
spoils
system
okuma
explained
that
the
executive
represented
the
executive
department
in
the
united
states
constitution
consisting
of
the
president
and
his
advisers
but
that
in
fact
it
was
the
head
of
the
shintô
religion
finance
war
and
foreign
departments
it
is
needless
to
say
that
this
state
paper
has
long
ago
been
superseded
by
the
existing
itô
constitution
of
then
i
went
on
to
katsu
he
said
that
sumpu
now
called
shidzuoka
was
to
have
been
formally
handed
over
to
the
tokugawa
family
two
days
previously
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
had
always
formed
part
of
their
possessions
he
took
down
from
a
shelf
a
memorandum
in
which
he
had
noted
down
some
years
before
the
names
of
the
ablest
men
in
different
clans
many
of
them
were
already
dead
satsuma
and
chôshiû
accounted
for
the
largest
number
of
the
tokugawa
clan
there
were
very
few
all
our
friends
of
satsuma
chôshiû
and
tosa
were
among
the
number
of
those
still
living
while
i
was
there
tsumagi
nakadzukasa
who
had
given
me
a
dinner
a
couple
of
months
earlier
came
in
he
had
returned
a
few
days
before
from
mito
where
he
had
left
keiki
employing
his
leisure
in
the
composition
of
japanese
poetry
and
not
expecting
to
be
invited
at
present
to
take
a
share
in
the
government
this
was
an
absolutely
baseless
notion
on
his
part
if
he
in
reality
entertained
it
he
had
sent
an
affectionate
message
to
katsu
which
tsumagi
appeared
to
be
afraid
of
delivering
in
my
presence
but
it
proved
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
warning
to
care
for
his
personal
safety
which
was
said
to
have
been
threatened
by
the
younger
tokugawa
men
he
said
that
about
mito
men
had
gone
to
join
aidzu
the
outcome
of
their
conversation
was
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
existing
political
situation
to
cause
them
anxiety
the
tokugawa
people
were
desirous
of
getting
katsu
to
take
office
under
kaménosuké
but
he
was
unwilling
i
asked
him
whether
he
had
heard
of
a
general
feeling
of
dislike
towards
the
english
that
he
replied
was
an
old
thing
dating
from
the
time
when
sir
harry
used
to
advise
the
shôgun
ministers
to
refrain
from
attacking
chôshiû
the
idea
was
no
doubt
fostered
by
roches
who
told
them
that
unless
they
asked
the
british
government
to
lend
naval
instructors
the
english
would
back
up
the
party
and
the
want
of
confidence
in
british
friendship
was
the
reason
why
dutchmen
had
been
engaged
to
bring
out
the
a
ship
of
war
constructed
in
england
for
the
prince
of
higo
by
glover
of
nagasaki
which
had
come
into
the
possession
of
the
mikado
adherents
i
had
heard
from
komatsu
and
nakai
that
imperialist
troops
landed
from
the
at
hirakata
about
the
or
august
had
gained
a
victory
there
over
a
mixed
force
of
sendai
men
and
tokugawa
and
this
was
confirmed
by
tsumagi
on
the
i
walked
as
far
as
the
the
bridge
in
the
centre
of
the
city
from
which
all
distances
were
measured
by
road
and
from
there
to
the
huge
hotel
at
the
foreign
settlement
constructed
under
the
supervision
of
the
tokugawa
government
for
the
accommodation
of
foreigners
the
commercial
quarter
was
very
lively
the
streets
were
crowded
especially
by
belonging
to
the
imperialist
forces
but
the
neighbourhood
of
the
below
the
castle
was
like
a
city
of
the
dead
on
the
i
had
a
visit
from
kawakatsu
omi
an
for
foreign
affairs
he
said
that
the
castle
of
sumpu
was
little
better
than
a
ruin
and
that
there
were
no
houses
which
could
receive
the
tokugawa
retainers
he
would
like
to
become
a
retainer
of
the
mikado
his
family
was
not
originally
in
the
service
of
the
tokugawa
family
but
was
of
more
ancient
descent
he
would
be
satisfied
if
he
was
made
a
minister
of
public
instruction
midzuno
wakasa
a
former
governor
of
yokohama
and
sugiura
takésaburô
another
tokugawa
man
would
probably
be
employed
by
the
imperialist
government
to
make
all
the
arrangements
with
regard
to
the
foreign
settlement
at
yedo
mimbu
taiyu
the
younger
brother
of
keiki
then
still
in
france
was
to
be
fetched
home
to
succeed
the
late
prince
of
mito
who
had
died
just
about
the
time
of
keiki
retreat
thither
about
a
hundred
and
thirty
went
up
to
kiôto
in
february
and
by
surrendering
to
the
mikado
secured
the
possession
of
their
lands
he
regretted
that
he
had
lost
everything
through
not
following
their
example
the
tokugawa
family
were
to
retain
of
lands
which
would
enable
them
to
keep
a
good
many
retainers
but
not
all
the
who
had
hitherto
belonged
to
the
clan
as
my
own
japanese
escort
who
belonged
to
the
body
of
created
several
years
before
to
act
as
guards
and
escorts
for
the
foreign
legations
of
whom
were
to
be
kept
together
for
that
purpose
all
wanted
to
become
mikado
men
on
the
komatsu
and
nakai
came
to
call
on
me
they
said
the
troops
sent
by
way
of
hirakata
to
tanagura
in
oshiû
had
been
completely
victorious
and
that
more
would
speedily
follow
in
fact
while
we
were
talking
satsuma
men
marched
past
the
house
along
the
by
the
seashore
in
order
to
embark
for
the
north
kido
who
had
gone
to
kiôto
to
report
the
state
of
affairs
at
yedo
was
expected
back
soon
they
thought
that
a
good
deal
of
pressure
would
be
necessary
to
induce
the
very
conservative
kiôto
court
to
bring
the
mikado
there
that
afternoon
i
called
on
okuma
who
was
still
very
unwell
and
like
most
of
the
hizen
people
not
disposed
to
be
communicative
from
him
i
went
to
nakai
who
showed
me
the
draft
of
the
state
paper
by
which
gotô
overturned
the
late
government
in
the
previous
october
it
differed
slightly
from
the
published
copies
in
that
it
contained
proposals
for
the
engagement
of
french
and
english
teachers
of
language
to
get
military
instructors
from
england
and
to
abolish
the
tycoon
and
reduce
the
tokugawa
clan
to
the
same
level
as
the
others
these
were
all
struck
out
on
reconsideration
in
order
to
avoid
exciting
a
suspicion
that
gotô
and
his
political
allies
were
too
partial
to
foreigners
and
provoking
the
hostility
of
the
and
he
had
also
the
drafts
of
a
letter
from
to
sanjô
in
which
among
other
things
which
strengthened
the
aidzu
resistance
to
the
imperial
troops
he
reported
that
foreign
vessels
anchored
at
niigata
and
supplied
the
rebels
with
arms
and
ammunition
and
said
that
on
his
informing
the
foreign
representatives
of
this
they
replied
that
they
would
put
a
stop
to
the
practice
i
pointed
out
to
nakai
that
this
must
be
a
mistake
the
ministers
having
issued
proclamations
of
neutrality
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
enforcement
and
that
if
the
japanese
authorities
wished
to
put
an
end
to
this
traffic
they
had
merely
to
notify
to
the
foreign
representatives
the
blockade
of
the
port
of
niigata
and
that
a
was
stationed
there
to
prevent
communication
with
the
shore
this
must
have
appeared
a
very
strange
doctrine
to
him
but
international
law
was
a
complete
novelty
in
japan
in
those
days
he
also
showed
me
the
draft
of
komatsu
letter
to
kiôto
about
the
treatment
of
the
nagasaki
japanese
christians
embodying
the
arguments
recently
used
to
him
by
sir
harry
and
advocating
the
adoption
of
milder
measures
next
day
i
went
again
to
see
nakai
and
found
with
him
a
very
attractive
satsuma
man
named
inouyé
iwami
who
was
greatly
interested
in
the
development
of
the
resources
of
the
island
of
yezo
he
was
full
of
schemes
for
its
colonization
from
japan
and
for
the
introduction
of
the
european
system
of
farming
under
the
supervision
of
a
german
named
gaertner
he
said
that
shimidzudani
a
young
court
noble
of
about
was
to
be
governor
of
hakodaté
and
that
he
intended
to
make
him
learn
english
we
discussed
various
leading
personalities
with
considerable
freedom
i
hinted
that
in
spite
of
his
rank
was
not
the
best
representative
man
to
send
to
europe
as
ambassador
i
thought
daté
or
iwakura
or
even
kansô
of
hizen
would
do
better
he
replied
that
iwakura
could
not
be
spared
the
most
important
and
interesting
suggestion
he
made
was
that
the
mikado
must
move
to
yedo
and
make
it
his
capital
as
otherwise
it
would
not
be
possible
to
keep
in
order
the
rebellious
clans
of
the
north
both
he
and
komatsu
who
joined
us
later
on
at
a
restaurant
on
the
river
approved
of
what
i
had
suggested
about
the
blockade
of
niigata
on
the
i
dined
with
komatsu
and
nakai
to
meet
okubo
the
satsuma
statesman
who
had
suggested
the
removal
of
the
capital
from
kiôto
to
ozaka
earlier
in
the
year
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
final
decision
to
make
yedo
the
centre
of
government
and
to
change
its
name
to
tôkiô
or
eastern
capital
was
largely
his
work
he
was
very
taciturn
by
disposition
and
the
only
information
he
vouchsafed
was
that
daté
was
to
go
to
sendai
to
endeavour
to
persuade
the
who
was
the
head
of
the
daté
family
and
all
its
branches
to
abandon
the
cause
of
aidzu
komatsu
talked
a
good
deal
about
the
english
naval
instructors
who
had
been
engaged
by
the
previous
government
whom
he
evidently
wished
to
get
rid
of
and
i
encouraged
him
to
dismiss
them
for
i
felt
it
would
not
be
fair
to
insist
on
their
keeping
these
officers
in
their
service
during
a
period
of
civil
war
when
the
british
neutrality
proclamation
prevented
their
making
use
of
them
komatsu
told
me
that
their
plan
was
to
retain
the
services
of
the
commissioned
officers
but
to
send
the
petty
officers
and
seamen
back
to
england
about
two
months
before
this
time
some
higo
men
had
called
on
me
and
said
they
were
going
north
to
tsugaru
they
argued
that
any
other
system
than
feudalism
was
impossible
in
japan
now
i
heard
that
the
higo
clan
had
privately
sent
messengers
to
wakamatsu
to
endeavour
to
effect
a
reconciliation
between
aidzu
and
the
of
the
west
and
south
but
aidzu
replied
that
matters
had
gone
too
far
and
the
questions
at
issue
must
be
decided
by
the
sword
i
thought
it
likely
that
these
envoys
from
higo
were
the
men
who
had
been
to
see
me
as
the
ideas
which
they
entertained
seemed
to
be
similar
the
translation
of
the
june
constitution
which
superseded
one
that
had
been
promulgated
in
march
had
given
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
i
was
unable
to
decide
upon
the
best
name
in
english
for
the
second
department
it
might
be
imperial
council
privy
council
or
cabinet
it
appeared
that
the
officials
of
this
department
were
merely
secretaries
to
the
two
prime
ministers
and
had
no
real
executive
authority
and
that
the
administration
was
divided
into
this
nameless
department
and
the
other
four
which
followed
it
this
was
okubo
explanation
it
was
however
pretty
evident
that
this
constitution
was
not
to
be
the
final
one
and
it
seemed
to
me
to
contain
in
itself
the
elements
of
change
there
were
so
many
appointments
that
were
held
by
dummies
of
high
birth
while
the
real
work
was
done
by
their
underlings
the
ancient
ranks
and
precedence
had
been
practically
done
away
with
and
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
the
court
and
territorial
nobles
and
would
have
to
be
struck
out
of
the
list
of
officials
there
was
hardly
one
of
them
fit
to
occupy
the
place
of
head
of
a
department
and
yet
these
appointments
were
confined
to
them
no
commoner
being
eligible
the
august
was
chiefly
occupied
with
arrangements
made
with
nakai
for
the
opening
of
yedo
on
october
by
instructions
from
the
chief
the
abolition
of
the
absurd
existing
rules
about
passports
for
foreigners
proceeding
to
yedo
and
for
ordering
one
of
the
naval
instructors
there
to
buoy
the
channel
the
government
had
arranged
to
have
a
huge
hotel
built
for
the
accommodation
of
foreign
visitors
and
the
owners
would
have
liked
to
let
it
but
it
seemed
unlikely
that
any
foreigner
would
undertake
to
run
such
an
establishment
on
his
own
account
and
i
advised
that
they
should
engage
a
man
from
yokohama
to
act
as
steward
for
the
proprietors
make
out
the
bills
and
purchase
the
necessary
wines
and
provisions
it
was
evident
that
the
imperialists
were
gathering
their
forces
for
a
combined
attack
on
aidzu
and
as
nakai
said
if
they
could
not
crush
him
with
their
troops
they
now
had
in
the
field
they
never
would
succeed
an
american
sailing
barque
named
the
despatch
was
hired
for
to
carry
men
to
hirakata
on
august
i
saw
men
march
through
shinagawa
to
embark
for
the
north
on
the
a
large
body
of
men
arrived
and
were
billetted
in
sengakuji
the
temple
in
which
the
faithful
rônins
were
buried
and
nakahara
naosuké
a
satsuma
man
usually
believed
to
be
their
admiral
but
in
reality
an
artillery
officer
had
been
sent
to
echigo
with
four
companies
of
artillery
and
great
things
were
expected
of
him
august
i
went
to
see
katsu
and
found
him
greatly
relieved
in
his
mind
as
the
result
of
a
visit
paid
to
him
on
the
previous
day
by
komatsu
he
said
that
the
castle
of
sumpu
had
been
handed
over
to
the
head
of
the
tokugawa
clan
on
the
but
that
the
territories
assigned
to
him
had
not
yet
been
vacated
by
their
previous
possessors
who
were
very
difficult
to
move
so
that
the
lands
at
present
available
did
not
exceed
in
extent
he
hoped
kaménosuké
by
which
he
of
course
meant
the
guardians
of
the
child
would
not
go
to
any
great
expense
in
building
or
in
engaging
crowds
of
retainers
he
said
that
the
flagship
of
enomoto
idzumi
who
commanded
the
tokugawa
fleet
was
supplied
with
provisions
by
that
clan
enomoto
otherwise
known
as
kamajirô
was
a
naval
officer
who
had
been
trained
in
holland
i
asked
him
whether
the
son
of
the
late
prince
of
mito
was
dead
or
whether
he
was
to
be
set
aside
in
favour
of
mimbu
taiyu
on
this
he
gave
me
the
following
account
of
mito
politics
which
had
been
a
puzzle
for
many
years
to
foreign
observers
noriakira
commonly
called
the
old
prince
of
mito
was
the
younger
son
of
harutoshi
and
his
childhood
name
was
keisaburô
his
elder
brother
narinobu
was
the
heir
and
his
portion
as
a
younger
brother
was
only
being
averse
to
society
on
account
of
his
deafness
he
spent
his
time
in
wandering
about
the
country
and
acquainting
himself
with
its
actual
condition
and
no
doubt
then
formed
the
habits
of
simplicity
and
frugality
which
distinguished
him
in
after
life
on
the
death
of
harutoshi
keisaburô
elder
brother
succeeded
him
but
dying
shortly
afterwards
left
the
vacant
by
that
time
two
parties
had
gradually
formed
themselves
in
the
mito
clan
one
which
supported
the
ancient
kiôto
policy
of
the
author
of
the
dainihonshi
the
other
which
fearing
keisaburô
had
formed
an
alliance
with
the
court
of
yedo
at
that
time
ably
directed
by
midzuno
echizen
no
kami
father
of
idzumi
no
kami
until
lately
a
member
of
the
council
of
state
the
latter
party
schemed
to
set
aside
the
claims
of
keisaburô
in
favour
of
an
adopted
heir
from
the
then
shôgun
family
a
will
of
the
late
prince
was
however
discovered
in
which
he
declared
his
desire
that
the
claims
of
blood
should
be
respected
and
his
brother
keisaburô
be
appointed
as
his
successor
the
will
was
backed
up
by
a
strong
party
known
as
the
and
keisaburô
became
prince
of
mito
this
was
in
when
he
was
about
years
of
age
the
new
prince
was
bent
on
carrying
out
certain
reforms
which
the
luxurious
habits
of
the
age
appeared
to
him
to
render
necessary
with
this
object
he
obtained
a
relaxation
of
the
ancient
rule
which
required
the
head
of
the
house
of
mito
to
be
a
resident
in
yedo
the
more
easily
because
he
had
rendered
himself
obnoxious
to
the
by
the
ostentatious
manner
in
which
he
seemed
to
reprove
their
pomp
and
luxury
by
the
simplicity
of
his
own
dress
and
manner
of
life
and
retiring
to
his
province
on
the
pretext
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
superintend
personally
the
government
of
the
clan
he
devoted
his
time
to
drilling
troops
in
the
only
fashion
then
known
in
japan
openly
advocating
the
supremacy
of
the
mikado
and
with
the
western
world
he
secretly
introduced
into
the
province
every
dutch
scholar
he
could
find
and
made
himself
acquainted
as
far
as
was
then
possible
with
the
resources
of
european
science
with
incredible
labour
he
constructed
from
drawings
contained
in
old
dutch
books
a
frigate
which
long
lay
at
yokohama
for
the
protection
of
foreigners
but
had
he
believed
been
since
broken
up
the
report
of
his
doings
having
been
brought
to
yedo
it
was
represented
to
the
that
the
drilling
of
men
and
building
of
warships
were
merely
preparations
for
carrying
out
the
traditional
mito
policy
and
that
the
prince
was
plotting
rebellion
in
he
was
compelled
to
retire
into
seclusion
and
he
was
succeeded
by
his
son
the
late
prince
then
a
mere
boy
in
a
dutch
made
its
appearance
at
nagasaki
and
caused
no
slight
consternation
at
yedo
it
was
said
that
the
nagasaki
dutchmen
were
becoming
restive
and
that
the
ship
was
merely
a
precursor
of
the
english
who
at
that
time
bore
the
detestable
reputation
of
being
a
nation
of
pirates
ready
for
any
violence
succeeding
events
proved
to
the
shôgun
government
that
japan
was
in
danger
of
being
forced
into
relations
with
european
powers
the
advent
of
admiral
perry
and
his
squadron
heightened
their
alarm
to
such
a
degree
that
they
yielded
to
the
voice
of
public
opinion
and
inviting
the
old
prince
of
mito
to
yedo
admitted
him
again
into
their
councils
in
the
shôgun
iyésada
died
and
the
old
prince
of
mito
wished
to
secure
the
succession
to
his
seventh
son
who
having
been
adopted
as
heir
to
the
house
of
shitotsubashi
was
in
a
legitimate
position
to
become
the
shôgun
heir
it
was
at
this
moment
that
ii
kamon
no
kami
came
into
power
and
though
it
is
uncertain
whether
he
had
a
previous
understanding
with
the
family
that
they
should
furnish
an
heir
it
is
certain
that
he
found
them
ready
to
comply
and
his
influence
was
strong
enough
to
force
old
mito
to
retire
a
second
time
into
private
life
and
to
order
echizen
tosa
and
uwajima
who
had
supported
the
mito
claims
to
resign
their
to
their
sons
the
assassination
of
ii
kamon
no
kami
a
couple
of
years
later
by
mito
men
was
the
consequence
other
influences
were
then
at
work
in
the
west
the
kiôto
policy
and
the
expulsion
of
foreigners
had
been
warmly
espoused
by
satsuma
and
hence
the
bond
of
union
between
them
and
the
section
of
the
mito
men
who
on
hearing
that
civil
war
had
broken
out
at
kiôto
made
their
appearance
before
the
castle
of
the
prince
and
demanded
that
he
should
carry
out
the
clan
policy
this
action
proving
unsuccessful
they
raised
the
standard
of
rebellion
on
mount
tsukuba
in
hitachi
whence
they
were
expelled
by
the
forces
of
the
shôgun
after
some
hard
fighting
their
fate
among
the
mountains
of
kaga
was
a
tale
takéda
who
had
been
driven
by
the
force
of
circumstances
to
join
them
and
several
hundred
of
his
comrades
were
beheaded
at
tsuruga
the
remainder
of
the
fled
to
kiôto
where
the
at
that
time
still
bearing
the
name
of
shitotsubashi
took
them
into
his
pay
now
that
the
revolution
of
the
previous
january
had
so
completely
changed
the
face
of
affairs
these
men
had
returned
to
their
native
province
headed
by
takéda
kinjirô
a
grandson
of
and
their
political
opponents
whom
they
styled
traitors
finding
themselves
on
the
losing
side
and
likely
to
be
in
a
perilous
minority
since
the
were
backed
up
by
the
imperialists
had
gone
off
to
echigo
to
the
number
of
some
five
hundred
the
out
of
gratitude
to
their
former
protector
had
determined
to
set
aside
the
heir
in
favour
of
mimbu
taiyu
shitotsubashi
younger
brother
and
had
despatched
agents
to
bring
the
latter
back
from
paris
that
day
nagaoka

arrived
by
sea
with
a
large
number
of
retainers

with

one
of

party
drank
so
much
that
he
lay
down
on
the
floor
and
went
to
sleep
in
half
an
hour
time
he
woke
up
quite
sober
and
was
able
to
repeat
the
process
from
september
to
october
adams
and
i
were
absent
on
a
chase
after
the
russians
who
were
reported
to
be
occupying
the
northern
coast
of
yezo
in
the
course
of
which
rattler
in
which
we
had
embarked
was
wrecked
in
sôya
bay
but
as
this
was
not
concerned
with
the
progress
of
political
events
in
japan
it
seems
unnecessary
to
occupy
space
in
narrating
our
experiences
we

for

in
recognition
of
their
gallant
conduct
on
the
of
march
were
handed
over
nakai
at
once
girt
his
on
and
strutted
about
with
a
cap
on
his
head
to
his
own
great
delight
and
the
intense
amusement
of
the
rest
of
the
company
as
it
happened
to
be
the
second
day
of
the
yokohama
races
it
was
proposed
that
the
whole
party
should
adjourn
to
the
sanjô
and
who
had
on
white
and
paper
caps
declined
i
rode
down
with
and
nagaoka
who
enjoyed
themselves
immensely
on
returning
home
i
took
nakai
in
with
me
and
gave
him
tea
in
exchange
for
this
he
informed
me
that
news
had
been
received
of
the
capture
of
the
outer
castle
of
wakamatsu
and
that
only
the
inner
ring
and
citadel
remained
in
possession
of
the
defenders
also
that
the
mikado
would
arrive
at
yedo
about
november
next
day
i
went
up
to
yedo
on
board
a
japanese
steamer
belonging
to
the
yokosuka
arsenal
with
sanjô
nagaoka
and
nakai
by
a
mistake
of
nakai
about
the
hour
of
leaving
i
kept
the
party
waiting
for
me
at
the
custom
house
and
a
mounted
messenger
had
to
be
sent
to
fetch
me
i
hurried
down
and
found
them
sitting
quietly
smoking
they
protested
against
my
apologising
how
different
from
some
europeans
on
the
mitford
and
i
went
to
call
on
katsu
his
wife
had
gone
off
to
sumpu
but
he
remained
to
do
the
head
of
the
clan
he
hoped
to
obtain
the
shimidzu
lands
amounting
to
for
feeding
the
retainers
who
had
lost
their
lands
and
pay
instead
of
the
lands
promised
in
oshiû
part
of
mikawa
and
the
whole
of
enshiû
had
been
conceded
but
the
hitherto
entitled
had
not
yet
given
up
possession
keiki
had
preceded
kaménosuké
to
sumpu
katsu
also
had
a
story
that
brunet
one
of
the
french
military
instructors
went
off
in
the
when
the
tokugawa
naval
squadron
left
the
yedo
anchorage
on
the
night
of
october
we
doubted
this
as
we
knew
that
he
had
just
received
promotion
in
the
french
army
nevertheless
it
turned
out
to
be
a
fact
he
was
accompanied
by
another
officer
named
caseneuve
and
several
other
frenchmen
we
also
visited
nakai
who
gave
us
a
dinner
from
the
hotel
he
said
that
the
citadel
of
wakamatsu
was
captured
on
october
he
had
also
received
a
letter
from
kido
placing
the
question
of
the
coming
to
yedo
beyond
a
doubt
and
as
we
returned
to
my
house
we
found
that
great
preparations
were
already
being
made
in
anticipation
of
his
majesty
arrival
roads
being
bridges
rebuilt
and
being
constructed
in
side
streets
where
they
had
never
existed
before
one
of
my
sano
ikunosuké
called
to
present
his
thanks
for
having
been
selected
by
the
court
to
remain
one
of
the
yedo
guard
for
foreigners
all
my
sixteen
men
had
been
engaged
for
this
service
he
said
that
the
shimidzu
domain
had
been
granted
provisionally
to
the
tokugawa
family
for
the
purpose
mentioned
by
katsu
november
was
the
last
day
on
which
men
of
the
tokugawa
clan
could
send
in
their
names
for
service
under
the
mikado
in
some
cases
they
would
receive
about
half
their
former
revenue
but
others
would
be
better
off
than
before
because
their
allowances
though
nominally
diminished
would
be
issued
in
rice
instead
of
in
money
at
a
low
fixed
rate
that
evening
mitford
and
i
dined
with
nagaoka
at
the
higo
in
shirokané
close
by
our
legation
and
nakai
being
the
other
guests
it
was
a
dinner
in
european
style
served
from
the
hotel
in
a
picturesque
house
built
in
the
garden
so
as
to
command
a
view
over
the
in
the
direction
of
the
bay
in
the
garden
there
were
some
splendid
trees
and
pretty
shaded
nooks
hosokawa
himself
was
there
very
fat
and
amiable
very
small
eyes
and
a
tendency
to
fly
catching
on
the
i
went
back
to
yokohama
at
an
interview
on
november
between
all
the
foreign
representatives
and
térashima
the
japanese
ministers
stated
that
the
castle
of
wakamatsu
had
surrendered
on
the
november
to
the
imperial
forces
the
two
princes
father
and
son
in
robes
of
ceremony
and
preceded
by
a
retainer
carrying
a
large
banner
inscribed
with
the
word
surrender
and
followed
by
the
garrison
likewise
in
robes
of
ceremony
and
with
their
heads
shaven
came
to
the
camp
of
the
besiegers
and
gave
themselves
up
the
castle
and
all
the
arms
it
contained
were
handed
over
and
the
two
princes
retired
into
strict
seclusion
at
a
buddhist
monastery
in
the
town
nakamura
hanjirô
the
chief
of
the
staff
wept
when
he
went
to
take
delivery
of
the
castle
and
its
contents
it
was
a
pleasure
to
us
to
see
how
the
countenances
of
some
of
those
who
had
to
listen
to
the
story
fell
for
they
had
counted
on
a
desperate
resistance
on
the
part
of
aidzu
to
defeat
the
imperialist
party
and
frustrate
the
policy
of
the
british
legation
now
that
this
exciting
episode
was
at
an
end
the
speedy
submission
of
the
other
northern
clans
could
be
counted
on
with
confidence
the
detailed
report
made
by
the
hizen
clan
dated
november
published
in
the
kiôto
gazette
shows
that
the
garrison
included
soldiers
troops
of
a
lower
class
wounded
outlaws
from
other
territories
women
and
children
officials
civilians
personal
attendants
of
the
princes
and
porters
there
was
no
record
of
the
number
of
men
killed
in
the
defence
on
november
i
went
to
yedo
with
captain
stanhope
charles
wirgman
the
artist
and
siddall
after
breakfasting
with
du
petit
thouars
on
board
the
dupleix
adams
and
william
marshall
went
up
by
road
on
our
arrival
possession
was
at
once
taken
of
siddall
by
a
japanese
doctor
named
takéda
shingen
and
he
was
carried
off
to
the
military
hospital
established
at
the
tôdô
in
the
shitaya
quarter
on
the
adams
mitford
marshall
and
wirgman
went
to
the
yoshiwara
and
had
a
feast
in
fine
style
at
the
kimpeirô
part
of
which
was
furnished
in
western
style
for
such
japanese
guests
as
liked
it
the
admission
of
europeans
into
that
quarter
of
the
town
from
which
they
had
until
then
been
jealously
shut
out
was
hailed
as
the
dawn
of
a
day
of
friendly
intercourse
of
the
frankest
character
next
evening
i
gave
a
great
entertainment
at
my
own
house
there
were
three
from
and
two
jesters
we
kept
it
up
boisterously
till
midnight
the
jesters
performed
a
foreigner
and
his
escort
arriving
at
the
kawasaki
ferry
on
the
way
to
yedo
and
meeting
with
the
usual
obstruction
at
the
hands
of
the
men
placed
there
to
guard
the
crossing
my
escort
men
also
exhibited
some
comic
scenes
much
to
their
own
satisfaction
and
to
the
delight
of
the
household
who
were
admitted
to
a
room
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
letters
arrived
from
the
chief
to
say
that
he
wanted
a
stand
erected
for
himself
opposite
to
the
gate
of
our
former
legation
buildings
in
front
of
sengakuji
for
him
to
see
the
mikado
pass
in
he
was
expected
to
reach
yedo
on
the
and
that
and
i
must
go
down
to
yokohama
on
the
to
see
himself
we
wrote
in
reply
to
say
that
a
stand
was
altogether
an
impossibility
seeing
what
japanese
etiquette
was
in
such
matters
and
that
i
could
not
leave
siddall
alone
in
yedo
without
some
one
to
interpret
for
him
so
next
day
wirgman
and
i
went
over
to
see
siddall
and
found
that
the
tôdô
had
now
been
turned
into
a
general
hospital
here
we
fell
in
with
old
ishigami
the
satsuma
doctor
who
married
a
daughter
of
old
freiherr
von
siebold
by
a
japanese
mother
a
very
cheery
person
after
lunch
we
went
with
him
and
a
crowd
of
other
japanese
doctors
to
uyéno
intending
to
get
in
and
examine
the
scene
of
the
fighting
that
took
place
on
july
but
the
gate
was
shut
in
our
face
and
though
we
waited
and
argued
patiently
for
a
whole
hour
with
the
sentries
we
could
not
convince
them
that
we
might
safely
be
admitted
i
think
our
japanese
companions
felt
even
more
annoyance
than
we
did
the
gateway
was
riddled
with
bullets
and
it
was
evident
that
a
pretty
stiff
fight
had
taken
place
there
in
july
we
stayed
the
night
at
the
hospital
and
spent
a
jolly
evening
with
ishigami
and
another
doctor
named
yamashita
next
morning
in
spite
of
the
bitter
cold
we
went
round
the
wards
with
the
doctors
all
the
state
apartments
of
the
mansion
had
been
converted
into
wards
and
provided
with
iron
bedsteads
and
hair
mattresses
there
was
a
very
plucky
little
tosa
boy
probably
a
drummer
who
had
had
his
foot
amputated
then
our
attention
was
attracted
to
an
little
surgeon
from
chôshiû
with
his
sleeves
turned
up
like
ruffles
over
a
pair
of
delicate
little
wrists
at
noon
there
came
the
two
brothers
notsu
shichizayemon
and
shichiji
who
persuaded
wirgman
and
myself
to
go
to
the
yoshiwara
with
them
instead
of
keeping
an
engagement
with
nakai
siddall
compounded
vini
and
after
partaking
of
this
we
started
on
a
journey
of
exploration
it
was
a
terribly
cold
day
with
a
gale
from
the
coming
straight
down
the
plain
from
the
snowy
peak
of
and
other
mountains
of
shinshiû
the
yoshiwara
lay
right
out
in
the
middle
of
the
occupying
a
considerable
extent
of
ground
it
was
entered
through
a
narrow
gate
at
the
end
of
a
long
causeway
after
passing
this
gate
we
were
introduced
into
the
upstairs
rooms
of
a
rather
shabby
house
evidently
much
frequented
by
the
satsuma
clan
were
of
course
sent
for
and
the
circulated
merrily
towards
nightfall
it
was
proposed
that
we
should
visit
the
kimpeirô
a
hideous
house
furnished
in
what
was
regarded
as
european
style
but
we
stayed
there
only
a
few
minutes
and
then
returned
to
the
house
where
we
had
first
been
entertained
here
we
had
more
drinking
dancing
and
playing
at
in
this
game
a
wooden
chopstick
is
broken
up
into
six
pieces
of
which
each
player
receives
three
he
puts
in
one
palm
as
many
as
he
thinks
fit
and
guesses
at
the
total
of
what
his
hand
and
the
hand
of
the
other
player
contain
if
he
guesses
right
the
loser
has
to
drink
and
his
turn
comes
to
give
the
challenge
evidently
this
is
the
way
to
get
speedily
drunk
we
stopped
there
till
a
message
came
from
ishigami
to
say
that
he
was
awaiting
us
at
another
house
to
drink
sober
again
we
went
in
search
of
him
to
a
restaurant
on
the
river
bank
the
where
much
singing
dancing
drinking
and
followed
till
we
had
had
enough
of
it
and
came
home
by
boat
to
the
hospital
accompanied
by
three
of
the
next
afternoon
the
artist
and
i
said
to
siddall
and
walked
over
to
nakai
but
not
finding
him
at
home
we
went
to
the
hotel
for
refreshment
where
we
sat
down
in
the
garden
and
found
ourselves
overwhelmed
with
melancholy
at
the
ugliness
of
the
building
for
five
cups
of
tea
and
a
bundle
of
manila
cheroots
the
manager
charged
us
a
dollar
to
the
surprise
and
horror
of
the
japanese
boy
who
waited
on
us
to
him
it
appeared
an
exorbitant
demand
the
cheroots
were
perhaps
worth
cents
which
left
cents
for
a
cup
of
tea
on
getting
home
to
takanawa
we
found
that
rickerby
the
proprietor
and
editor
of
the
japan
times
had
just
arrived
in
a
boat
from
yokohama
to
witness
the
ceremony
of
the
following
day
november
about
ten
in
the
morning
the
mikado
passed
into
yedo
having
slept
at
shinagawa
mitford
the
artist
rickerby
and
i
saw
the
procession
from
the
open
space
recently
created
in
front
of
the
new
gate
of
what
had
previously
been
sir
harry
parkes
diplomatic
residence
now
transformed
into
a
sort
of
foreign
office
the
display
could
not
be
described
as
splendid
for
the
effect
of
what
was
oriental
in
the
courtiers
costumes
was
marred
by
the
horribly
untidy
soldiers
with
unkempt
hair
and
clothing
vilely
imitated
from
the
west
the
mikado
palanquin
was
to
us
a
curious
novelty
as
it
passed
along
the
silence
which
fell
upon
the
crowd
was
very
striking
old
daté
who
rode
between
it
and
the
closed
chair
in
which
the
mikado
was
really
seated
nodded
to
us
in
a
friendly
manner
rickerby
wrote
and
published
an
excellent
newspaper
account
of
the
whole
show
a
few
days
afterwards
in
the
japan
times
in
the
afternoon
he
and
i
walked
to
a
buddhist
religious
house
at
shinagawa
celebrated
for
its
very
pretty
plantations
of
maple
from
there
we
proceeded
to
a
house
of
entertainment
the
close
by
to
drink
and
crack
jokes
with
the
girls
about
the
prince
of
bizen
who
had
passed
the
night
there
the
house
was
full
of
troops
from
the
west
but
they
scarcely
took
any
notice
of
us
and
in
fact
all
those
we
met
on
the
road
ignored
us
completely
it
must
be
said
that
whenever
i
went
out
into
the
streets
of
yedo
i
was
always
accompanied
by
my
aidzu
noguchi
and
from
four
to
six
of
my
personal
escort
of
the
on
the
sir
harry
and
alford
the
bishop
of
victoria
hongkong
came
up
to
yedo
and
were
entertained
in
european
style
at
the
new
foreign
office
by
daté
and
machida
and
môri
young
satsuma
men
were
also
of
the
party
both
had
been
in
england
and
spoke
english
the
latter
who
was
only
about
particularly
well
next
day
mitford
and
i
went
to
call
on
nakai
we
met
there
machida
and
yamaguchi
hanzô
a
hizen
who
brought
with
him
a
man
who
had
just
returned
from
shônai
he
reported
that
shônai
had
submitted
on
the
instant
and
that
two
foreigners
one
an
american
the
other
an
englishman
both
from
hakodaté
were
present
as
spectators
nakai
who
was
a
member
of
the
local
government
of
the
city
now
called
the
instead
of
yedo
had
given
in
his
resignation
because
he
found
that
the
instead
of
placing
confidence
in
himself
and
the
other
officials
was
in
the
habit
of
upsetting
their
arrangements
on
the
complaint
of
a
few
wretched
tradespeople
wirgman
and
i
went
down
to
yokohama
on
the
walking
as
far
as
where
richardson
was
murdered
in
whence
we
took
boat
across
to
the
foreign
settlement
at
in
shinagawa
we
fell
in
with
notsu
shichizayémon
and
with
two
kurohané
men
and
one
from
utsunomiya
companions
on
the
occasion
of
our
visit
to
the
yoshiwara
of
whom
the
satsuma
men
were
on
their
way
home
there
was
a
large
consumption
of
and
japanese
dishes
and
much
doric
japanese
spoken
further
on
at
or
as
it
had
now
become
the
fashion
to
call
this
very
pleasant
house
between
yedo
and
the
ferry
at
kawasaki
we
found
oyama
who
was
like
the
others
returning
to
kagoshima
as
the
civil
war
was
practically
at
an
end
we
drank
many
parting
cups
together
and
then
walked
with
him
to
his
hotel
at
kawasaki
the
road
was
full
of
homeward
bound
satsuma
men
and
tokugawa
people
going
to
sumpu
a
report
had
got
about
that
difficulties
had
arisen
between
satsuma
and
higo
and
that
the
latter
in
conjunction
with
arima
and
chikuzen
were
going
to
fall
upon
the
great
clan
that
in
consequence
of
this
the
troops
were
rushing
off
as
fast
as
possible
to
forestal
the
attack
another
rumour
much
credited
by
the
french
legation
was
that
aidzu
surrendered
only
on
condition
that
the
satsuma
troops
should
be
withdrawn
from
the
east
and
north
of
the
country
and
the
mikado
come
to
yedo
but
as
others
besides
the
satsuma
fighting
men
were
also
going
home
these
stories
were
easily
discredited
on
december
i
went
back
to
yedo
in
a
common
palanquin
from
kanagawa
and
on
foot
from
kawasaki
at
i
met
midzuno
chinami
hurrying
back
from
shimoda
where
he
had
been
put
ashore
from
manila
here
was
the
late
governor
of
yokohama
who
last
year
used
to
ride
in
a
state
palanquin
with
a
large
cortége
and
preceded
by
running
footmen
crying
down
on
your
knees
now
travelling
in
a
wretched
cheap
hackney
without
a
single
retainer
for
all
that
he
seemed
cheerful
enough
a
good
deal
of
my
time
in
those
days
was
passed
in
the
compilation
of
an
dictionary
of
the
spoken
language
and
in
reading
japanese
novels
on
the
i
went
over
to
the
hospital
where
i
found
siddall
with
his
hands
full
wounded
men
from
echigo
having
begun
to
arrive
willis
had
gone
on
from
echigo
to
wakamatsu
to
look
after
the
aidzu
wounded
of
whom
there
were
nearly
in
the
castle
when
it
was
surrendered
my
new
pony
fushimi
a
present
from
katsu
before
he
left
yedo
carried
me
splendidly
the
imperialists
who
crowded
the
streets
appeared
to
admire
with
envy
a
black
hat
which
i
was
wearing
on
the
i
went
there
again
to
pass
the
night
with
ishigami
and
yamashita
they
complained
bitterly
of
one
mayéda
kiôsai
who
had
been
appointed
chief
of
the
hospital
and
said
that
the
patients
had
threatened
to
cut
his
head
off
because
he
spent
his
time
in
driving
about
the
city
in
a
carriage
and
pair
instead
of
attending
to
his
duties
the
reflection
came
naturally
that
you
can
not
make
a
silk
purse
out
of
a
sow
ear
or
give
the
standing
of
an
european
physician
to
a
japanese
apothecary
on
december
i
went
to
the
hotel
to
dine
with
machida
the
indispensable
nakai
was
there
also
okubo
and
yoshii
the
latter
had
left
wakamatsu
on
december
willis
was
there
looking
after
the
wounded
of
whom
he
said
there
were
at
least
two
thousand
on
the
aidzu
side
alone
snow
was
lying
deep
both
in
echigo
and
aidzu
shônai
was
pacified
and
the
whole
country
might
now
be
said
to
be
at
peace
a
state
of
things
which
of
course
was
displeasing
to
whether
among
diplomatists
or
merchants
information
had
arrived
that
the
murderers
of
the
two
sailors
of
icarus
in
august
had
been
discovered
they
were
from
chikuzen
and
the
party
to
which
they
belonged
was
said
to
number
nine
in
all
this
of
course
would
be
welcome
news
to
the
tosa
people
it
was
strange
that
retainers
of
chikuzen
who
entertained
admiral
king
so
hospitably
in
january
should
have
been
guilty
of
such
a
wanton
crime
the
newly
issued
paper
money
known
as
was
much
discussed
and
it
was
evidently
creating
a
great
ferment
among
the
people
uchida
the
mayor
of
kanasugi
who
had
been
to
see
me
a
few
days
earlier
said
that
a
refusal
to
receive
these
notes
in
the
payment
of
taxes
was
the
only
obstacle
to
their
free
circulation
nakai
denied
the
correctness
of
the
statement
that
taxes
might
not
be
paid
with
them
but
he
thought
that
in
the
end
it
would
be
found
necessary
to
establish
a
proper
banking
system
by
giving
authority
to
the
great
firm
of
mitsui
to
issue
notes
against
a
reserve
of
coin
or
bullion
it
was
a
matter
of
vital
importance
to
the
imperial
government
which
had
not
found
any
money
in
the
tokugawa
treasury
and
the
mikado
had
always
been
kept
very
poorly
supplied
by
the
shôgun
ministers
chapter
xxxiv
enomoto
with
the
runaway
tokugawa
ships
seizes
yezo
on
december
machida
came
to
me
with
a
report
from
hakodaté
that
the
tokugawa
pirates
as
they
were
styled
after
their
refusal
to
surrender
and
their
exodus
from
yedo
bay
on
october
had
landed
at
that
port
from
the
and
her
consorts
the
rebels
were
led
by
a
member
of
the
french
military
mission
sent
out
in
who
had
gone
off
with
them
when
they
left
the
bay
and
it
was
very
annoying
for
the
french
legation
that
this
officer
should
have
violated
the
neutrality
proclaimed
by
the
minister
and
have
joined
rebels
against
the
authority
of
a
sovereign
with
whom
france
maintained
friendly
relations
a
fight
had
ensued
near
hakodaté
in
which
a
large
number
of
imperialists
were
killed
or
wounded
the
yokohama
foreign
press
however
represented
that
the
mikado
men
had
won
the
victory
at
a
place
about
miles
from
the
port
according
to
despatches
received
from
the
consul
the
rebels
had
had
by
far
the
best
of
it
the
foreign
residents
were
in
a
great
state
of
alarm
the
consul
wrote
thus
as
the
enemy
approach
we
shall
retire
towards
the
hill
if
he
comes
nearer
we
shall
go
up
the
hill
and
should
it
come
to
the
last
extremity
we
shall
have
no
resource
but
to
put
our
trust
in
an
power
nakai
came
on
the
to
talk
about
the
new
paper
money
and
the
difficulties
with
foreigners
to
which
it
would
give
rise
tom
glover
opinion
was
quoted
in
favour
of
a
paper
circulation
but
he
did
not
himself
agree
that
a
merchant
who
was
naturally
an
interested
party
should
be
regarded
as
an
authority
on
currency
this
paper
money
had
been
issued
to
the
troops
who
forced
the
and
the
hucksters
on
the
high
roads
to
accept
it
in
payment
but
this
could
not
go
on
long
for
the
paper
did
not
pass
current
amongst
the
civilian
population
we
spoke
about
the
state
of
foreign
relations
he
admitted
that
the
old
distrust
of
foreigners
still
existed
the
foreign
representatives
were
regarded
as
a
necessary
evil
to
be
endured
but
not
to
be
embraced
nothing
pleased
the
government
so
much
as
to
see
the
diplomatists
living
at
yokohama
and
the
idea
of
asking
their
advice
upon
any
matter
was
never
entertained
for
a
moment
in
fact
the
representatives
were
looked
upon
much
in
the
same
light
as
the
agents
of
the
persons
sent
to
japan
by
their
respective
governments
to
receive
the
mikado
orders
whenever
occasion
might
arise
the
representatives
were
themselves
partly
to
blame
for
this
state
of
things
fine
houses
comfortable
living
and
whole
skins
at
yokohama
were
doubtless
preferable
to
makeshifts
and
dangers
at
yedo
but
for
all
they
knew
or
could
learn
of
pending
international
questions
they
might
just
as
well
be
resident
at
hongkong
another
day
was
spent
with
the
mayor
of
kanasugi
and
three
or
four
retainers
at
the
classical
theatre
in
iigura
chô
to
see
and
minami
torajirô
was
also
among
the
audience
this
was
a
young
aidzu
who
had
come
in
the
previous
april
to
see
me
with
his
countryman
hirozawa
when
i
had
a
great
argument
with
the
latter
about
japanese
politics
and
especially
about
the
part
our
legation
had
taken
it
was
the
first
time
a
foreigner
had
been
present
at
this
kind
of
theatrical
performance
is
a
sort
of
tragedy
or
historical
play
is
low
comedy
there
is
no
scenery
and
the
costumes
are
all
in
an
ancient
style
the
stage
is
about
feet
square
and
a
long
passage
on
the
left
connects
it
with
the
greenroom
from
which
the
actors
make
their
appearance
there
are
and
printed
books
of
the
text
known
as
could
be
bought
for
a
trifling
cost
they
are
delivered
in
slow
recitative
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
music
or
rather
dissonance
of
the
fife
and
small
drum
the
orchestra
likewise
dressed
in
antique
fashion
were
seated
on
campstools
at
the
back
of
the
stage
the
which
pleased
me
most
were
in
which
a
sort
of
moses
primrose
is
sent
to
kiôto
to
buy
a
fan
and
is
cheated
by
the
merchant
into
paying
for
an
umbrella
and
ga
in
which
a
fellow
having
tried
in
vain
to
persuade
his
aunt
a
rich
old
curmudgeon
to
give
him
some
puts
on
a
devil
mask
and
frightens
her
into
submission
while
he
goes
to
get
drunk
at
the
store
room
where
the
liquor
is
kept
he
threatens
to
eat
her
if
she
looks
his
way
her
cries
oh
fearful
to
behold
spare
your
retainer
life
her
anger
on
discovering
in
the
drunken
and
sleepy
demon
her
rascally
nephew
were
infinitely
diverting
the
i
could
not
understand
until
i
borrowed
the
book
from
a
japanese
lady
in
the
next
box
and
was
enabled
to
follow
the
text
this
was
no
sano
genzayémon
who
has
been
deprived
of
his
feudal
estate
entertains
a
buddhist
priest
at
night
having
no
food
to
offer
him
nor
fuel
to
warm
the
room
he
cuts
down
his
own
favourite
dwarf
plum
cherry
and
pine
trees
and
makes
a
fire
of
the
branches
in
return
for
this
the
holy
man
persuades
the
lord
of
kamakura
to
restore
to
him
his
forfeited
lands
there
were
at
that
time
three
other
companies
of
and
the
audience
consisted
entirely
of
the
class
the
two
aidzu
princes
were
brought
to
the
suburb
of
senji
on
december
matsudaira
higo
now
like
all
other

the
of
the
imperialist
forces
engaged
in
echigo
and
oshiu
was
expected
to
arrive
in
yedo
on
the
and
on
or
about
the
the
foreign
representatives
were
officially
notified
of
the
restoration
of
peace
the
guns
and
stores
of
rattler
which
had
perforce
to
be
left
behind
at
sôya
when
the
dupleix
brought
us
away
had
been
offered
to
the
mikado
government
and
accepted
by
them
this
was
the
news
heard
from
okubo
and
yoshii
whom
i
met
at
nakai
on
the
as
a
measure
of
protection
for
british
and
french
subjects
at
hakodaté
the
satellite
and
vénus
were
despatched
thither
on
the
the
former
conveying
our
secretary
of
legation
adams
his
history
of
japan
vol
gives
an
account
of
what
he
saw
and
did
there
up
to
the
of
december
however
that
place
had
not
been
threatened
with
an
attack
from
the
fugitive
tokugawa
navy
my
old
writing
master
tédzuka
who
came
to
call
gave
me
the
following
statistics
about
his
clan
the
chief
name
was
sengoku
sanuki
no
kami
and
he
ruled
over
territories
assessed
at
the
actual
yield
to
the
was
of
rice
of
this
were
accounted
for
by
fiefs
held
by
retainers
were
required
for
the
maintenance
of
the
personal
establishment
and
an
equal
quantity
went
in
expenses
of
administration
the
latter
included
official
salaries
cost
of
journeys
to
court
at
yedo
of
soldiers
in
the
field
arms
etc
the
clan
numbered
no
more
than
families
its
constitution
as
regards
the
offices
of
and
was
the
same
as
in
the
case
of
other
clans
in
accordance
with
orders
promulgated
in
no
of
the
kiôto
gazette
the
old
practice
of
hereditary
had
been
abolished
and
a
system
of
promotion
by
merit
established
in
its
stead
in
order
to
carry
out
these
new
arrangements
the
hereditary
fiefs
of
the
retainers
ought
he
thought
to
be
equalized
when
i
went
back
to
yokohama
on
the
i
found
that
news
had
been
received
of
the
capture
which
i
had
anticipated
of
hakodaté
by
the
runaway
tokugawa
ships
and
the
flight
of
with
all
his
staff
the
consul
was
as
one
would
expect
very
seriously
alarmed
and
from
the
satellite
expedition
to
the
spot
one
could
not
look
for
any
results
of
importance
on
december
a
great
conference
was
held
at
the
legation
in
yokohama
of
the
chief
with
daté
komatsu
kido
machida
and
ikébé
goi
of
yanagawa
in
kiûshiû
the
first
thing
they
wanted
was
that
sir
harry
would
arrange
to
give
yamaguchi
hanzô
a
passage
on
board
an
english
to
hakodaté
in
order
that
he
might
open
negotiations
with
the
rebel
leaders
the
chief
seemed
to
me
to
fear
that
this
would
involve
him
too
much
in
the
opinion
of
the
public
as
a
partizan
of
the
imperial
government
and
he
advised
them
instead
to
despatch
a
common
messenger
across
the
strait
from
awomori
bearing
written
offers
to
treat
seeing
that
they
could
not
induce
him
to
accede
to
their
request
they
acquiesced
in
his
suggestion
but
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
one
doubt
whether
they
would
follow
his
advice
a
great
discussion
took
place
on
the
christian
question
in
which
the
japanese
spoke
very
reasonably
and
sir
harry
likewise
until
he
unfortunately
lost
his
temper
over
the
arguments
used
by
kido
and
made
use
of
very
violent
language
such
as
i
do
not
care
to
repeat
the
result
was
that
they
promised
to
write
notes
to
the
foreign
representatives
announcing
the
mikado
intention
of
showing
clemency
to
the
converts
next
day
ikébé
came
to
me
to
explain
the
theory
of
the
imperial
paper
currency
but
i
did
not
understand
much
of
what
he
said
and
we
wandered
off
into
other
subjects
especially
christianity
the
old
fellow
professed
to
be
not
only
an
admirer
of
its
doctrines
but
also
a
believer
in
the
afternoon
the
chief
and
i
went
to
return
daté
call
at
what
had
formerly
been
the
governor
official
residence
at
tobé
a
suburb
of
yokohama
they
had
a
long
conversation
especially
about
the
christian
question
and
the
representative
system
and
sir
harry
tried
to
pump
him
about
the
future
capital
would
it
be
at
kiôto
ozaka
or
yedo
tokei
tôkiô
for
we
had
of
course
read
what
okubo
ichizô
had
written
on
the
subject
early
in
the
year
the
old
prince
gave
him
some
very
polite
digs
in
the
ribs
about
his
violent
language
of
the
previous
day
saying
that
when
people
became
animated
in
conversation
spectators
were
apt
to
think
that
a
dispute
was
going
on
whereas
instead
of
that
being
the
case
it
was
merely
that
the
speakers
were
in
earnest
and
naturally
every
man
desired
to
express
his
own
views
the
chief
replied
that
his
animation
was
caused
by
the
extreme
regret
he
felt
at
seeing
the
japanese
do
things
that
were
prejudicial
to
themselves
on
this
daté
observed
that
it
did
them
good
now
and
then
to
be
got
angry
with
wo
tatté
this
set
the
chief
and
as
we
were
driving
home
he
suddenly
said
i
think
they
would
never
have
spoken
to
the
other
representatives
about
christianity
had
it
not
been
for
the
little
piece
of
excitement
i
got
up
yesterday
i
replied
well
it
may
be
so
but
i
think
you
hurt
kido
feelings
he
shut
up
at
once
and
preserved
a
marked
silence
did
you
think
so
says
i
am
sorry
to
think
he
was
offended
i
then
said
if
you
will
excuse
my
speaking
freely
i
believe
that
although
that
sort
of
thing
may
have
a
good
effect
in
a
particular
case
it
makes
the
japanese
dread
interviews
with
you
upon
this
the
chief
declared
that
he
would
have
kido
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
and
begged
me
to
write
him
as
polite
a
note
of
invitation
as
possible
chapter
xxxv
audience
of
the
mikado
at
yedo
on
january
i
went
back
to
yedo
as
we
long
continued
to
call
the
eastern
capital
being
like
most
englishmen
averse
to
innovation
the
city
had
been
opened
to
foreign
trade
and
residence
on
the
and
dear
old
william
willis
was
installed
as
he
and
adams
had
returned
on
december
the
one
from
caring
for
the
wounded
in
echigo
and
aidzu
the
other
from
hakodaté
on
january
we
had
an
audience
of
the
mikado
on
this
occasion
sir
harry
asked
a
large
number
of
naval
and
military
officers
besides
captain
stanhope
of
the
ocean
and
colonel
norman
in
command
of
the
so
the
list
of
persons
to
be
presented
fixed
originally
at
twelve
was
increased
to
double
that
figure
as
usual
the
chief
had
mismanaged
the
business
because
he
insisted
on
doing
it
all
himself
instead
of
leaving
details
to
his
subordinates
and
he
did
not
even
know
the
names
of
those
who
were
to
be
presented
the
squadron
furnished
a
guard
of
a
hundred
marines
the
costumes
worn
were
very
various
especially
those
of
the
legation
and
consulate
men
it
was
a
terribly
cold
day
snow
falling
which
changed
into
sleet
and
then
into
rain
by
the
time
we
reached
the
castle
and
what
made
things
worse
was
that
we
had
to
ride
on
horseback
instead
of
driving
in
carriages
the
audience
took
place
in
the
palace
of
the
just
inside
the
sakurada
gate
we
were
allowed
to
ride
over
the
first
bridge
past
the
usual
or
notice
to
alight
right
up
to
the
abutments
of
the
second
bridge
where
we
got
down
here
we
were
met
by
machida
who
conducted
us
into
the
courtyard
from
which
we
ascended
at
once
into
the
the
prince
of
awa
sanjô
nakayama
dainagon
and
okubo
came
in
and
exchanged
the
usual
compliments
then
we
were
ushered
into
a
very
dark
room
where
the
mikado
was
sitting
under
a
canopy
rather
larger
than
that
used
at
ozaka
it
was
so
dark
that
we
could
hardly
distinguish
his
dress
but
his
face
which
was
whitened
artificially
shone
out
brightly
from
the
surrounding
obscurity
the
prime
minister
stood
below
on
the
right
and
after
had
uttered
a
few
words
of
inquiry
about
the
queen
health
and
congratulated
the
chief
on
continuing
at
yedo
as
minister
read
the
mikado
speech
to
this
sir
harry
replied
very
neatly
after
the
audience
which
took
up
no
more
than
five
minutes
was
over
we
cantered
back
to
the
old
legation
building
in
takanawa
now
converted
into
a
branch
of
the
japanese
foreign
office
where
we
had
great
feasting
beginning
by
an
entertainment
in
japanese
style
very
good
of
its
kind
followed
by
a
late
luncheon
supplied
from
the
hotel
awa
and
presided
in
our
room
the
american
minister
and
the
north
german
chargé
were
also
present
proposed
the
health
of
the
queen
the
president
and
the
king
of
prussia
after
which
we
drank
to
the
health
of
the
mikado
katsu
had
come
back
to
yedo
and
early
in
january
was
to
start
again
for
sumpu
to
lay
a
foundation
for
negotiation
with
the
tokugawa
runaway
ships
at
hakodaté
on
the
a
review
of
the
english
troops
in
garrison
at
yokohama
was
held
for
the
entertainment
of
the
prince
of
awa
as
our
particular
friend
and
a
party
of
young
court
nobles
these
were
not
men
of
political
importance
and
i
do
not
think
we
ever
heard
of
them
again
the
rapidity
of
the
fire
from
the
snider
rifles
was
a
surprise
to
all
the
spectators
on
the
the
chief
and
i
having
ridden
up
to
yedo
in
the
morning
he
had
an
important
interview
at
the
palace
of
the
shôguns
with
iwakura
kido
and
machida
were
also
present
many
compliments
were
offered
to
sir
harry
and
assurances
of
the
gratitude
which
the
mikado
government
felt
for
the
hearty
recognition
they
had
received
from
great
britain
to
this
succeeded
some
confidential
conversation
it
was
intended
that
the
mikado
should
return
to
kiôto
to
be
married
and
also
for
the
performance
of
certain
funeral
rites
in
honour
of
his
late
father
when
these
ceremonies
were
completed
he
would
come
again
to
his
eastern
capital
to
hold
a
great
council
of
the
empire
the
date
of
this
was
not
yet
fixed
it
might
be
in
the
first
month
of
the
japanese
calendar
perhaps
in
the
third
sir
harry
advised
iwakura
to
notify
this
to
all
the
foreign
representatives
the
question
of
foreign
neutrality
and
the
situation
at
hakodaté
were
then
discussed
iwakura
denounced
very
eloquently
those
of
the
ministers
who
while
recognising
the
mikado
as
sovereign
granted
the
status
of
belligerents
to
the
hakodaté
pirates
sir
harry
declared
for
himself
and
the
french
minister
outrey
that
no
neutrality
existed
and
that
they
did
not
recognize
enomoto
and
his
associates
as
belligerents
nor
did
van
polsbroek
to
this
iwakura
responded
why
does
the
american
minister
still
allege
a
declaration
of
neutrality
as
the
ground
of
his
refusal
to
hand
over
the
jackson
to
the
lawful
government
sir
harry
replied
that
the
declaration
in
question
had
been
of
very
great
service
to
the
mikado
government
that
but
for
its
existence
enomoto
would
now
be
in
possession
of
the
ram
and
that
he
himself
had
been
mainly
instrumental
in
procuring
the
signature
of
that
document
this
was
quite
true
an
excellent
lunch
was
served
from
the
hotel
and
we
parted
from
our
hosts
just
at
sundown
both
parties
well
satisfied
with
each
other
i
went
on
the
january
to
visit
siddall
at
his
hospital
on
the
other
side
of
the
city
there
i
found
willis
who
on
the
way
there
from
tsukiji
the
foreign
settlement
had
been
threatened
by
a
we
discussed
together
the
means
by
which
the
japanese
government
might
be
induced
to
apply
for
the
services
of
willis
for
a
year
in
order
to
assist
them
in
establishing
their
general
hospital
so
we
told
ishigami
that
siddall
was
to
be
recalled
to
the
legation
and
that
must
ask
for
willis
the
mikado
had
presented
willis
with
seven
rolls
of
beautiful
gold
brocade
and
wrote
a
nice
letter
thanking
the
dear
old
fellow
for
his
services
to
the
japanese
wounded
warriors
on
january
we
heard
that
the
had
sailed
from
hakodaté
with
her
rudder
lashed
to
her
stern
her
destination
was
supposed
to
be
esashi
where
fighting
was
going
on
it
was
believed
that
the
pirates
were
running
short
of
money
and
rice
the
ainos
were
reported
to
have
joined
the
people
of
matsumae
in
resisting
the
pirates
i
had
some
interesting
conversation
with
ikébé
goi
whom
i
went
to
see
on
the
at
his
lodgings
i
met
a
young
man
named
yoshida
magoichirô
a
councillor
of
the
yanagawa
clan
we
talked
about
christianity
and
ikébé
cited
the
sermon
on
the
mount
as
a
composition
that
pleased
him
more
than
anything
written
by
buddhist
or
confucian
sages
i
remarked
that
the
christian
religion
reversed
the
chinese
saying
do
not
unto
others
as
ye
would
not
that
others
should
do
unto
you
upon
which
he
quoted
the
command
to
turn
the
other
cheek
to
be
smitten
after
a
little
he
began
to
talk
about
my
chief
violence
in
conference
and
said
now
in
his
case
when
he
gets
in
a
rage
so
far
from
offering
the
other
cheek
i
feel
inclined
to
kick
him
out
of
the
room
ikébé
said
that
the
mikado
would
leave
for
kiôto
about
the
or
january
and
that
a
notification
had
been
issued
announcing
his
departure
during
the
first
decade
of
the
month
to
return
again
in
the
spring
on
the
morning
of
the
i
was
summoned
by
the
chief
to
yokohama
in
a
great
hurry
to
attend
a
conference
between
iwakura
and
the
foreign
colleagues
i
rode
the
miles
on
my
pony
fushimi
in
two
hours
and
a
half
without
drawing
bridle
and
arrived
at
the
legation
to
find
the
conference
just
assembling
iwakura
addressed
to
the
colleagues
pretty
much
the
same
arguments
as
he
had
made
use
of
at
on
the
they
put
a
number
of
questions
to
him
by
way
of
reply
and
at
last
said
they
could
not
give
answer
to
so
important
a
matter
as
he
had
laid
before
them
without
mature
consideration
iwakura
then
said
that
he
would
take
the
opportunity
of
saying
a
few
words
about
the
causes
of
the
existing
political
situation
the
present
mikado
was
the
descendant
of
sovereigns
who
ruled
the
country
more
than
years
back
the
shôgunate
was
an
institution
not
more
than
years
old
still
the
power
had
been
in
its
hands
and
it
was
during
the
continuance
of
its
authority
that
the
americans
came
to
the
country
in
the
people
were
sharp
enough
to
see
the
necessity
and
advantage
of
entering
into
relations
with
foreign
countries
while
the
mikado
court
followed
by
the
greater
part
of
the
nation
professed
the
policy
the
country
thus
became
disturbed
and
the
authority
of
the
shôgun
could
no
longer
be
maintained
then
both
the
mikado
and
the
shôgun
died
and
the
latter
successor
a
man
of
ability
was
able
to
see
the
absolute
indispensability
of
a
government
directed
by
the
mikado
sincerely
convinced
of
this
he
surrendered
the
power
into
the
hands
of
the
mikado
not
as
a
mere
gift
but
because
it
was
the
only
way
of
solving
the
political
difficulties
which
existed
thereupon
the
mikado
government
changed
its
policy
with
regard
to
foreigners
and
did
what
never
could
have
been
done
under
the
late
sovereign
that
is
entered
into
relations
with
the
treaty
powers
hitherto
our
relations
had
been
merely
commercial
but
the
government
hoped
that
they
would
improve
and
become
something
like
those
which
existed
among
european
and
other
civilized
nations
the
foreign
ministers
replied
that
they
would
consult
together
and
send
him
a
reply
without
delay
sir
harry
came
up
on
the
from
yokohama
to
tell
iwakura
the
result
of
yesterday
conference
of
colleagues
on
the
subject
of
neutrality
we
were
to
have
met
him
at
but
when
we
got
there
we
found
the
gates
shut
and
since
no
orders
had
been
received
to
admit
us
we
came
away
as
we
were
returning
to
the
legation
mori
came
after
us
in
a
great
hurry
and
begged
the
chief
to
turn
back
but
he
refused
and
said
iwakura
might
come
to
see
him
this
message
was
misunderstood
by
mori
and
there
was
more
delay
but
at
last
everything
was
arranged
and
iwakura
came
at
seven
to
the
legation
accompanied
by
iwakura
had
sent
through
mori
to
ask
me
to
come
to
yedo
in
order
that
he
might
speak
to
me
personally
but
i
took
no
notice
of
this
request
treating
it
merely
as
an
invitation
to
the
chief
or
rather
as
a
request
to
me
to
be
present
on
the
in
order
to
perform
interpretation
he
asked
sir
harry
what
had
been
the
result
of
the
conference
of
foreign
ministers
and
all
he
could
say
was
that
it
had
been
adjourned
it
appeared
that
the
colleagues
were
willing
to
make
a
declaration
that
the
war
was
over
but
were
not
willing
to
give
up
the
stonewall
jackson
and
that
in
order
to
justify
her
retention
they
would
not
withdraw
their
notifications
of
neutrality
to
us
this
appeared
highly
illogical
the
chief
after
iwakura
had
repeated
all
his
arguments
and
had
added
that
so
far
from
desiring
to
get
hold
of
the
stonewall
in
order
to
attack
enomoto
the
mikado
government
were
determined
to
offer
him
lenient
terms
declared
that
in
his
own
opinion
the
war
had
ceased
and
that
the
neutrality
lapsed
with
it
and
that
he
was
ready
to
state
this
in
writing
iwakura
said
that
the
mikado
was
very
desirous
of
knowing
the
answers
of
the
ministers
and
had
therefore
ordered
him
to
stop
behind
for
five
days
in
order
to
try
to
settle
this
question
and
to
rejoin
him
at
shimidzu
a
port
on
the
tôkaidô
that
he
would
like
to
get
sir
harry
answer
confidentially
so
that
the
mikado
might
have
a
pleasant
souvenir
to
carry
away
with
him
another
thing
iwakura
said
was
that
the
mikado
government
had
made
a
sufficient
display
of
power
by
reducing
the
provinces
of
oshiû
and
déwa
in
six
months
whereas
in
former
wars
twelve
years
had
been
nothing
extraordinary
that
their
intention
was
to
adopt
a
humane
line
of
conduct
and
they
had
therefore
ordered
the
two
tokugawas
of
sumpu
and
mito
to
proceed
against
the
remaining
rebels
and
if
they
succeeded
in
arranging
matters
keiki
would
be
pardoned
and
restored
to
favour
he
had
himself
seen
katsu
who
believed
that
the
offer
of
lenient
terms
would
induce
submission
the
mikado
government
would
not
however
consider
any
capitulation
satisfactory
that
was
not
accompanied
by
a
complete
surrender
of
arms
and
ships
of
war
if
the
rebels
proved
obstinate
they
must
be
reduced
by
force
this
frank
statement
drew
out
a
favourable
reply
from
sir
harry
iwakura
also
appeared
to
be
alarmed
about
the
attitude
of
russia
and
asked
whether
she
might
not
possibly
enter
into
an
alliance
with
enomoto
the
chief
thought
this
unlikely
the
interview
lasted
three
hours
and
ended
with
many
thanks
from
iwakura
and
apologies
for
having
kept
sir
harry
waiting
at
the
gate
of
the
chief
on
his
side
undertook
to
do
everything
possible
to
bring
his
colleagues
round
to
his
view
and
to
induce
them
to
send
in
their
answer
by
the
and
he
engaged
to
publish
his
own
reply
in
the
japan
herald
of
the
same
day
that
would
be
as
decisive
a
manifestation
of
his
policy
as
he
could
possibly
give
i
was
greatly
pleased
myself
to
find
that
he
had
now
made
up
his
mind
to
go
the
whole
hog
the
mikado
passed
through
takanawa
about
eight
the
following
morning
on
his
way
back
to
kiôto
his
train
appeared
to
be
smaller
than
on
the
occasion
of
his
entry
news
arrived
from
hakodaté
on
january
that
the
had
got
on
the
rocks
near
esashi
and
was
expected
to
stick
there
her
guns
had
been
thrown
overboard
and
buoyed
the
sentences
on
aidzu
and
sendai
were
promulgated
on
the
with
the
penalties
inflicted
on
other
of
the
northern
provinces
and
a
few
more
who
had
held
out
to
the
last
the
aidzu
princes
were
let
off
with
their
lives
but
the
whole
of
their
territories
were
confiscated
sendai
was
reduced
from
to
the
reigning
prince
was
made
to
retire
into
private
life
and
was
succeeded
by
a
son
of
our
old
friend
the
daté
of
uwajima
on
the
a
further
conference
of
the
ministers
was
held
with
reference
to
the
question
of
withdrawing
the
declarations
of
neutrality
and
the
little
italian
minister
who
came
up
to
yedo
on
the
assured
us
that
only
sir
harry
and
polsbroek
were
willing
to
consent
the
others
having
refused
letters
however
arrived
from
sir
harry
showing
that
all
the
colleagues
had
agreed
to
write
a
acknowledging
that
the
war
was
over
but
demanding
a
short
delay
in
order
to
concert
measures
for
the
simultaneous
withdrawal
of
their
notifications
also
a
note
from
him
instructing
me
to
arrange
an
interview
with
iwakura
for
adams
and
montebello
secretary
of
the
french
legation
in
order
that
they
might
hand
to
him
the
petition
which
the
tokugawa
rebels
at
hakodaté
had
asked
outrey
and
sir
harry
to
forward
to
the
mikado
the
translation
of
this
document
was
made
and
sent
off
at
once
then
after
learning
from
that
was
fixed
for
the
interview
mitford
and
i
went
off
to
kido
to
whom
i
gave
a
copy
of
the
about
neutrality
he
at
once
pitched
on
the
delay
clause
as
unsatisfactory
but
i
could
only
give
him
my
opinion
that
this
was
inserted
as
a
sort
of
compromise
it
was
better
i
said
for
the
mikado
government
that
all
the
ministers
should
agree
to
recognise
that
the
war
was
over
even
with
this
slight
drawback
than
that
only
two
of
them
should
have
recognised
the
fact
and
the
other
four
have
continued
to
declare
themselves
neutral
a
memorandum
reached
us
from
adams
stating
the
nature
of
the
final
arrangement
and
suggesting
that
the
government
should
make
it
generally
known
by
publishing
the
correspondence
in
their
official
gazette
then
i
went
off
to
place
to
meet
adams
montebello
and
dubousquet
who
arrived
there
about
a
quarter
past
two
proceedings
began
by
montebello
handing
in
outrey
copy
of
the
iwakura
at
once
pointed
out
the
sentence
in
the
letters
of
the
english
and
french
ministers
which
spoke
of
short
delay
and
asked
what
was
its
meaning
both
adams
and
montebello
replied
that
they
had
no
authority
to
say
anything
on
this
point
but
they
undertook
at
his
request
to
write
to
their
chiefs
and
obtain
if
possible
a
definite
date
i
also
whispered
to
yamaguchi
hanzô
to
tell
iwakura
afterwards
that
kido
already
knew
all
about
the
compromise
the
business
of
handing
over
the
petition
of
the
tokugawa
rebels
was
then
proceeded
with
iwakura
was
told
that
in
delivering
this
document
the
ministers
did
not
offer
any
opinion
on
its
contents
and
they
renounced
for
themselves
any
idea
of
acting
as
mediators
but
that
as
the
japanese
foreign
minister
had
expressed
to
both
of
them
his
desire
to
learn
if
possible
the
feelings
and
intentions
of
the
fugitives
they
were
very
glad
to
have
this
opportunity
of
complying
with
his
request
an
officer
of
the
french
military
mission
who
devoted
himself
to
the
study
of
the
japanese
language
and
ultimately
became
interpreter
to
the
french
legation
iwakura
replied
that
these
men
had
now
been
declared
to
be
rebels
and
the
two
clans
of
mito
and
sumpu
had
been
ordered
out
against
them
that
the
proper
course
to
adopt
in
presenting
the
petition
which
he
had
just
read
was
to
send
it
through
the
chiefs
of
those
two
clans
from
the
hasty
glance
he
had
cast
over
the
document
he
could
not
profess
to
judge
of
its
merits
but
he
was
glad
to
see
that
the
petitioners
had
some
desire
however
slight
of
returning
to
their
allegiance
but
if
he
had
been
aware
of
the
extreme
bumptiousness
of
the
letter
to
parkes
and
outrey
in
which
the
petitions
were
forwarded
he
would
hardly
have
thought
so
still
while
thanking
the
ministers
and
appreciating
the
disinterestedness
of
their
motives
he
could
not
consent
to
receive
the
petition
through
such
a
channel
would
the
ministers
mind
forwarding
it
through
the
tokugawa
clan
adams
and
montebello
declined
to
have
any
business
relations
with
the
clan
and
after
some
urging
from
the
french
side
iwakura
said
he
would
accept
the
petition
temporarily
and
give
his
answer
we
then
returned
home
and
adams
despatched
a
report
to
the
chief
next
day
the
in
the
afternoon
came
fresh
instructions
adams
was
to
go
to
iwakura
inform
him
of
the
surprise
felt
by
both
ministers
at
the
refusal
to
accept
the
petition
and
state
that
the
expression
short
delay
in
the
respecting
neutrality
meant
what
it
said
after
consultation
with
montebello
it
was
decided
to
ask
for
an
interview
with
iwakura
at
on
the
morning
of
the
and
a
letter
to
that
effect
was
sent
off
to
before
an
answer
could
be
received
at
the
legations
there
came
a
letter
from
yamaguchi
hanzô
written
by
iwakura
order
refusing
to
accept
the
petition
and
saying
that
as
he
was
going
down
to
yokohama
next
day
to
see
the
representatives
on
the
subject
of
neutrality
he
would
take
the
opportunity
of
speaking
to
the
two
ministers
about
the
other
matter
as
well
however
reply
to
our
letter
soon
arrived
to
say
that
iwakura
departure
was
postponed
for
a
day
and
that
he
would
see
the
two
secretaries
as
proposed
by
them
on
the
as
i
was
unwell
mitford
went
in
my
stead
to
interpret
for
adams
iwakura
receded
from
his
previous
attitude
and
declared
himself
ready
to
receive
the
petition
from
the
two
ministers
but
that
he
intended
to
return
it
to
the
tokugawa
fugitives
without
taking
any
notice
of
its
contents
further
that
he
was
determined
to
demand
from
the
ministers
the
meaning
of
the
words
short
delay
he
also
addressed
a
letter
to
the
two
ministers
thanking
them
for
the
trouble
they
had
taken
about
the
petition
which
he
characterized
as
impertinent
it
would
therefore
have
to
be
returned
direct
this
was
a
slap
in
the
face
for
our
two
chiefs
who
ought
never
to
have
presented
the
petition
considering
the
covering
letters
received
by
them
which
threatened
to
throw
down
the
gauntlet
to
the
mikado
government
if
it
did
not
leave
them
in
quiet
possession
of
yezo
but
sir
harry
was
drawn
on
by
the
fear
that
outrey
would
manage
to
get
the
petition
accepted
and
thereby
win
prestige
but
if
so
outrey
little
game
was
frustrated
by
iwakura
good
luck
or
perspicacity
the
following
day
i
had
to
rush
down
to
yokohama
for
iwakura
meeting
with
the
foreign
representatives
he
asked
what
they
meant
by
short
time
they
appeared
to
him
to
have
had
time
enough
already
when
issuing
their
original
notifications
of
neutrality
they
had
acted
immediately
on
receiving
the
communication
of
the
mikado
government
and
why
hesitate
now
the
colleagues
fenced
a
little
with
the
question
and
then
retired
into
another
room
to
consider
their
answer
when
they
emerged
they
announced
their
readiness
to
issue
proclamations
in
fourteen
days
time
at
the
furthest
with
this
iwakura
was
forced
to
be
content
but
our
chief
had
gained
the
battle
and
was
correspondingly
rejoiced
iwakura
left
the
same
afternoon
in
the
keangsoo
for
the
port
of
toba
in
shima
informed
the
ministers
that
yedo
was
to
be
the
capital
of
the
country
after
the
mikado
return
there
next
japanese
but
this
decision
was
not
at
present
to
be
made
public
he
displayed
a
map
of
the
city
and
offered
them
the
whole
waterside
from
the
kanasugi
bridge
to
the
hotel
except
the
owari
where
the
foreign
office
was
to
be
for
sites
on
which
to
build
legations
all
but
sir
harry
declared
their
unwillingness
to
accept
sites
i
remarked
to
myself
that
he
was
gradually
getting
out
of
the
bad
habit
of
believing
all
the
japanese
told
him
to
be
lies
originally
the
flagship
of
captain
sherard
osborn
when
in
command
of
the
chinese
flotilla
brought
out
by

and
afterwards
bought
by

xxxvi
last
days
in
tokio
and
departure
for
home
a
week
before
this
iwakura
had
sent
me
a
present
of
a
beautiful
lacquered
cabinet
by
way
of
thanks
for
the
trouble
he
said
i
had
taken
in
interpreting
for
him
on
various
occasions
and
on
january
when
i
returned
to
yedo
i
found
a
letter
from
saméshima
seizô
with
presents
from
the
prince
of
satsuma
okubo
yoshii
and
himself
the
letter
said
prince
satsuma
wishes
me
to
give
you
his
thanks
for
your
kindness
and
the
trouble
you
have
hitherto
taken
for
his
sake
he
presents
you
the
two
boxes
and
the
rest
though
a
little
okubo

myself
present
you
merely
to
thank
you
for
your
kindness
we
hope
you
will
always

is

room
with
a
big
lacquered
brazier
between
us
the
japanese
guests
were
ranged
along
both
sides
of
the
room
and
at
the
end
i
had
to
apologize
by
way
of
form
for
sitting
on
a
cushion
which
as
host
i
ought
not
to
have
done
under
the
pretence
that
it
made
my
knees
sore
to
squat
on
the
mats
there
was
a
great
deal
of
stiff
conversation
at
first
until
the
was
brought
and
the
waiting
women
from
the
restaurant
that
supplied
the
dinner
the

clever
girl
from

dance
an
immense
quantity
of
was

every
one
departed
well
pleased
by

who
had
been
in
france
with
mimbu
taiyu
had
at
last
arrived
back
in
japan
releasing
me
from
the
duties
that
had
kept
me
two
years
longer
than
provided
by
the
existing
rules
about
leave
of
absence
on
february
he
and
i
went
to
call
on
katsu
who
had
been
such
a
valuable
source
of
political
information
ever
since
the
downfall
of
the
shôgunate
katsu
thought
the
tokugawa
rebels
at
hakodaté
would
give
in
their
submission
at
parting
he
gave
me
his
short
sword
and
we
separated
with
many
mutual
expressions
of
regret
he
was
quartered
in
an
outhouse
at
the
where
old
takénouchi
a
retainer
who
had
been
our
purveyor
of
news
and
papers
current
among
the
was
also
living
we
had
to
go
into
his
rooms
and
drink
a
cup
of
tea
there
i
found
the
secretary
of
daté
gorô
a
distinguished
official
to
whom
i
sent
my
farewell
compliments
we
got
back
to
my
house
just
in
time
to
rush
off
again
to
a
dinner
at
the
hotel
given
by
in
honour
of
my
departure
besides
mitford

and
myself
the

one
of
the
recently
established
yedo
newspapers
and
tsudzuki
shôzô
of
uwajima
it
was
a
very
pleasant
party
little
bizen
greeted
me
very
politely
said
he
had
heard
a
great
deal
about
me
but
had
not
had
a
previous
opportunity
of
meeting
me
so
had
taken
advantage
of
this
farewell
entertainment
to
make
my
acquaintance
i
had
the
post
of
honour
at
the
left
of
after
dinner
they
drank
my
health
in
bumpers
of
champagne
and
wished
me
a
pleasant
voyage
every
one
had
some
commission
to
give
me
the
japanese
government
wanted
six
expensive
gold
watches
and
chains
tsudzuki
shôzô
who
presented
me
with
a
farewell
letter
written
in
the
name
of
old
daté
asked
for
a
copy
of
hertslet
treaties
besides

okubo
yoshii
and

i
received
presents
from
machida
my
japanese
escort
men
and
a
host
of
other
people
including
kido
the
latter
spoke
to
me
confidentially
after
dinner
about
the
advantages
which
would
result
to
japan
from
opening
a
port
in
corea
not
so
much
material
as
moral
by
teaching
the
coreans
to
look
abroad
outside
their
own
country
both
he
and
mori
talked
about
the
native
christians
and
asked
my
advice
i
counselled
moderate
measures
and
long
notes
to
the
foreign
ministers
now
and
then
to
keep
them
quiet
i
acknowledged
the
difficulty
of
instilling
the
idea
of
toleration
into
the
minds
of
the
whole
japanese
people
by
act
of
parliament
and
told
them
of
the
disabilities
under
which
protestants
had
lain
in
spain
until
recently
but
i
did
not
see
the
advantage
of
mori
suggestion
of
allotting
lands
in
yezo
to
the
christians
with
the
free
exercise
of
their
religion
tsudzuki
confided
to
me
as
a
great
secret
the
intended
visit
to
england
of
a
young
bizen
named
tokura
altogether
we
spent
a
very
satisfactory
evening
in
spite
of
the
long
distance
we
had
to
go
for
our
dinner
next
day

the

came

noguchi

nagazawa
and
four
of
my
japanese
guard
came
down
the
road
as
far
as
where
we
had
a
parting
cup
sent
me
a
complimentary
letter
regretting
my
departure
and
presenting
me
with
a
big

as
a

of
the

had
done

relations
kido
also
wrote
asking
me
to
communicate
to
him
any
information
about
japanese
affairs
that
i
might
pick
up
in
europe
promising
to
answer
any

to
say
whether
they
were
caused
by
the
emotion
that
a

always
produces

kind
london
one
of
those
books
which
make
a
people
live
before
us
most
admirably
illustrated
one
of
the
most
readable
books
about
primitive
peoples
which
have
appeared
in
recent
years
the
author
knows
his
subject
not
as
an
observant
impressionable
tourist
but
as
a
man
who
has
lived
among
the
ibos
for
many
years
the
classical
authority
on
the
very
curious
people
it
describes
a
comprehensive
study
of
the
customs
and
beliefs
of
the
ibo
people
describing
their
marriage
usages
their
burial
rites
their
arts
crafts
music
trade
and
currency
their
ways
of
making
war
their
religious
beliefs
so
far
as
these
can
be
accurately
discovered
and
their
sacrificial
rites
there
are
nearly
forty
admirable
photographs
a
mass
of
information
about
ibo
life
and
character
and
customs
which
is
probably
unique
and
which
no
british
official
or
trader
can
ever
hope
to
possess
and
the
substance
of
this
information
the
author
has
condensed
into
these
well
arranged
and
well
written
chapters
he
tells
us
what
he
knows
about
the
ibos
and
he
knows
a
great
deal
he
knows
too
much
to
dogmatise

this

is
a
worthy
memorial
to
a
great

a
great
work

arnot

spiritually
a
very
great
man
that
he
was
one
of
the
most
faithful
of
christ

is
apparent
from
every
page
of
the
book
baker
has
done
his
work
in
the
right
spirit
and
with
full
sympathy
there
was
much
of
austerity
in
arnot
career
but
there
was
no
severity
there
is
a
quiet
and
patient
reliance
through
all
a
reliance
which
carried
him
through
most
exacting
circumstances
one
authority
said
that
he
had
two
great
characteristics
of
a
thorough
african

kindness

this

is
of
compelling
interest
the
diaries
of
the
great
african

as
a

the

find
in
it
plenty
of
remarkable

descriptions
of

especially
the
of

from
a
little
