memoirs
of
carwin
the
biloquist
a
fragment
by
charles
brockden
brown
chapter
i
was
the
second
son
of
a
farmer
whose
place
of
residence
was
a
western
district
of
pennsylvania
my
eldest
brother
seemed
fitted
by
nature
for
the
employment
to
which
he
was
destined
his
wishes
never
led
him
astray
from
the
and
the
furrow
his
ideas
never
ranged
beyond
the
sphere
of
his
vision
or
suggested
the
possibility
that
could
differ
from
he
could
read
and
write
because
he
had
no
alternative
between
learning
the
lesson
prescribed
to
him
and
punishment
he
was
diligent
as
long
as
fear
urged
him
forward
but
his
exertions
ceased
with
the
cessation
of
this
motive
the
limits
of
his
acquirements
consisted
in
signing
his
name
and
spelling
out
a
chapter
in
the
bible
my
character
was
the
reverse
of
his
my
thirst
of
knowledge
was
augmented
in
proportion
as
it
was
supplied
with
gratification
the
more
i
heard
or
read
the
more
restless
and
unconquerable
my
curiosity
became
my
senses
were
perpetually
alive
to
novelty
my
fancy
teemed
with
visions
of
the
future
and
my
attention
fastened
upon
every
thing
mysterious
or
unknown
my
father
intended
that
my
knowledge
should
keep
pace
with
that
of
my
brother
but
conceived
that
all
beyond
the
mere
capacity
to
write
and
read
was
useless
or
pernicious
he
took
as
much
pains
to
keep
me
within
these
limits
as
to
make
the
acquisitions
of
my
brother
come
up
to
them
but
his
efforts
were
not
equally
successful
in
both
cases
the
most
vigilant
and
jealous
scrutiny
was
exerted
in
vain
reproaches
and
blows
painful
privations
and
ignominious
penances
had
no
power
to
slacken
my
zeal
and
abate
my
perseverance
he
might
enjoin
upon
me
the
most
laborious
tasks
set
the
envy
of
my
brother
to
watch
me
during
the
performance
make
the
most
diligent
search
after
my
books
and
destroy
them
without
mercy
when
they
were
found
but
he
could
not
outroot
my
darling
propensity
i
exerted
all
my
powers
to
elude
his
watchfulness
censures
and
stripes
were
sufficiently
unpleasing
to
make
me
strive
to
avoid
them
to
effect
this
desirable
end
i
was
incessantly
employed
in
the
invention
of
stratagems
and
the
execution
of
expedients
my
passion
was
surely
not
deserving
of
blame
and
i
have
frequently
lamented
the
hardships
to
which
it
subjected
me
yet
perhaps
the
claims
which
were
made
upon
my
ingenuity
and
fortitude
were
not
without
beneficial
effects
upon
my
character
this
contention
lasted
from
the
sixth
to
the
fourteenth
year
of
my
age
my
father
opposition
to
my
schemes
was
incited
by
a
sincere
though
unenlightened
desire
for
my
happiness
that
all
his
efforts
were
secretly
eluded
or
obstinately
repelled
was
a
source
of
the
bitterest
regret
he
has
often
lamented
with
tears
what
he
called
my
incorrigible
depravity
and
encouraged
himself
to
perseverance
by
the
notion
of
the
ruin
that
would
inevitably
overtake
me
if
i
were
allowed
to
persist
in
my
present
career
perhaps
the
sufferings
which
arose
to
him
from
the
disappointment
were
equal
to
those
which
he
inflicted
on
me
in
my
fourteenth
year
events
happened
which
ascertained
my
future
destiny
one
evening
i
had
been
sent
to
bring
cows
from
a
meadow
some
miles
distant
from
my
father
mansion
my
time
was
limited
and
i
was
menaced
with
severe
chastisement
if
according
to
my
custom
i
should
stay
beyond
the
period
assigned
for
some
time
these
menaces
rung
in
my
ears
and
i
went
on
my
way
with
speed
i
arrived
at
the
meadow
but
the
cattle
had
broken
the
fence
and
escaped
it
was
my
duty
to
carry
home
the
earliest
tidings
of
this
accident
but
the
first
suggestion
was
to
examine
the
cause
and
manner
of
this
escape
the
field
was
bounded
by
cedar
railing
five
of
these
rails
were
laid
horizontally
from
post
to
post
the
upper
one
had
been
broken
in
the
middle
but
the
rest
had
merely
been
drawn
out
of
the
holes
on
one
side
and
rested
with
their
ends
on
the
ground
the
means
which
had
been
used
for
this
end
the
reason
why
one
only
was
broken
and
that
one
the
uppermost
how
a
pair
of
horns
could
be
so
managed
as
to
effect
that
which
the
hands
of
man
would
have
found
difficult
supplied
a
theme
of
meditation
some
accident
recalled
me
from
this
reverie
and
reminded
me
how
much
time
had
thus
been
consumed
i
was
terrified
at
the
consequences
of
my
delay
and
sought
with
eagerness
how
they
might
be
obviated
i
asked
myself
if
there
were
not
a
way
back
shorter
than
that
by
which
i
had
come
the
beaten
road
was
rendered
circuitous
by
a
precipice
that
projected
into
a
neighbouring
stream
and
closed
up
a
passage
by
which
the
length
of
the
way
would
have
been
diminished
one
half
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
the
water
was
of
considerable
depth
and
agitated
by
an
eddy
i
could
not
estimate
the
danger
which
i
should
incur
by
plunging
into
it
but
i
was
resolved
to
make
the
attempt
i
have
reason
to
think
that
this
experiment
if
it
had
been
tried
would
have
proved
fatal
and
my
father
while
he
lamented
my
untimely
fate
would
have
been
wholly
unconscious
that
his
own
unreasonable
demands
had
occasioned
it
i
turned
my
steps
towards
the
spot
to
reach
the
edge
of
the
stream
was
by
no
means
an
easy
undertaking
so
many
abrupt
points
and
gloomy
hollows
were
interposed
i
had
frequently
skirted
and
penetrated
this
tract
but
had
never
been
so
completely
entangled
in
the
maze
as
now
hence
i
had
remained
unacquainted
with
a
narrow
pass
which
at
the
distance
of
an
hundred
yards
from
the
river
would
conduct
me
though
not
without
danger
and
toil
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
ridge
this
glen
was
now
discovered
and
this
discovery
induced
me
to
change
my
plan
if
a
passage
could
be
here
effected
it
would
be
shorter
and
safer
than
that
which
led
through
the
stream
and
its
practicability
was
to
be
known
only
by
experiment
the
path
was
narrow
steep
and
overshadowed
by
rocks
the
sun
was
nearly
set
and
the
shadow
of
the
cliff
above
obscured
the
passage
almost
as
much
as
midnight
would
have
done
i
was
accustomed
to
despise
danger
when
it
presented
itself
in
a
sensible
form
but
by
a
defect
common
in
every
one
education
goblins
and
spectres
were
to
me
the
objects
of
the
most
violent
apprehensions
these
were
unavoidably
connected
with
solitude
and
darkness
and
were
present
to
my
fears
when
i
entered
this
gloomy
recess
these
terrors
are
always
lessened
by
calling
the
attention
away
to
some
indifferent
object
i
now
made
use
of
this
expedient
and
began
to
amuse
myself
by
hallowing
as
loud
as
organs
of
unusual
compass
and
vigour
would
enable
me
i
uttered
the
words
which
chanced
to
occur
to
me
and
repeated
in
the
shrill
tones
of
a
mohock
savage
cow
cow
come
home
home
these
notes
were
of
course
reverberated
from
the
rocks
which
on
either
side
towered
aloft
but
the
echo
was
confused
and
indistinct
i
continued
for
some
time
thus
to
beguile
the
way
till
i
reached
a
space
more
than
commonly
abrupt
and
which
required
all
my
attention
my
rude
ditty
was
suspended
till
i
had
surmounted
this
impediment
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
at
leisure
to
renew
it
after
finishing
the
strain
i
paused
in
a
few
seconds
a
voice
as
i
then
imagined
uttered
the
same
cry
from
the
point
of
a
rock
some
hundred
feet
behind
me
the
same
words
with
equal
distinctness
and
deliberation
and
in
the
same
tone
appeared
to
be
spoken
i
was
startled
by
this
incident
and
cast
a
fearful
glance
behind
to
discover
by
whom
it
was
uttered
the
spot
where
i
stood
was
buried
in
dusk
but
the
eminences
were
still
invested
with
a
luminous
and
vivid
twilight
the
speaker
however
was
concealed
from
my
view
i
had
scarcely
begun
to
wonder
at
this
occurrence
when
a
new
occasion
for
wonder
was
afforded
me
a
few
seconds
in
like
manner
elapsed
when
my
ditty
was
again
rehearsed
with
a
no
less
perfect
imitation
in
a
different
quarter
to
this
quarter
i
eagerly
turned
my
eyes
but
no
one
was
visible
the
station
indeed
which
this
new
speaker
seemed
to
occupy
was
inaccessible
to
man
or
beast
if
i
were
surprized
at
this
second
repetition
of
my
words
judge
how
much
my
surprise
must
have
been
augmented
when
the
same
calls
were
a
third
time
repeated
and
coming
still
in
a
new
direction
five
times
was
this
ditty
successively
resounded
at
intervals
nearly
equal
always
from
a
new
quarter
and
with
little
abatement
of
its
original
distinctness
and
force
a
little
reflection
was
sufficient
to
shew
that
this
was
no
more
than
an
echo
of
an
extraordinary
kind
my
terrors
were
quickly
supplanted
by
delight
the
motives
to
dispatch
were
forgotten
and
i
amused
myself
for
an
hour
with
talking
to
these
cliffs
i
placed
myself
in
new
positions
and
exhausted
my
lungs
and
my
invention
in
new
clamours
the
pleasures
of
this
new
discovery
were
an
ample
compensation
for
the
ill
treatment
which
i
expected
on
my
return
by
some
caprice
in
my
father
i
escaped
merely
with
a
few
reproaches
i
seized
the
first
opportunity
of
again
visiting
this
recess
and
repeating
my
amusement
time
and
incessant
repetition
could
scarcely
lessen
its
charms
or
exhaust
the
variety
produced
by
new
tones
and
new
positions
the
hours
in
which
i
was
most
free
from
interruption
and
restraint
were
those
of
moonlight
my
brother
and
i
occupied
a
small
room
above
the
kitchen
disconnected
in
some
degree
with
the
rest
of
the
house
it
was
the
rural
custom
to
retire
early
to
bed
and
to
anticipate
the
rising
of
the
sun
when
the
moonlight
was
strong
enough
to
permit
me
to
read
it
was
my
custom
to
escape
from
bed
and
hie
with
my
book
to
some
neighbouring
eminence
where
i
would
remain
stretched
on
the
mossy
rock
till
the
sinking
or
beclouded
moon
forbade
me
to
continue
my
employment
i
was
indebted
for
books
to
a
friendly
person
in
the
neighbourhood
whose
compliance
with
my
solicitations
was
prompted
partly
by
benevolence
and
partly
by
enmity
to
my
father
whom
he
could
not
more
egregiously
offend
than
by
gratifying
my
perverse
and
pernicious
curiosity
in
leaving
my
chamber
i
was
obliged
to
use
the
utmost
caution
to
avoid
rousing
my
brother
whose
temper
disposed
him
to
thwart
me
in
the
least
of
my
gratifications
my
purpose
was
surely
laudable
and
yet
on
leaving
the
house
and
returning
to
it
i
was
obliged
to
use
the
vigilance
and
circumspection
of
a
thief
one
night
i
left
my
bed
with
this
view
i
posted
first
to
my
vocal
glen
and
thence
scrambling
up
a
neighbouring
steep
which
overlooked
a
wide
extent
of
this
romantic
country
gave
myself
up
to
contemplation
and
the
perusal
of
milton
comus
my
reflections
were
naturally
suggested
by
the
singularity
of
this
echo
to
hear
my
own
voice
speak
at
a
distance
would
have
been
formerly
regarded
as
prodigious
to
hear
too
that
voice
not
uttered
by
another
by
whom
it
might
easily
be
mimicked
but
by
myself
i
can
not
now
recollect
the
transition
which
led
me
to
the
notion
of
sounds
similar
to
these
but
produced
by
other
means
than
reverberation
could
i
not
so
dispose
my
organs
as
to
make
my
voice
appear
at
a
distance
from
speculation
i
proceeded
to
experiment
the
idea
of
a
distant
voice
like
my
own
was
intimately
present
to
my
fancy
i
exerted
myself
with
a
most
ardent
desire
and
with
something
like
a
persuasion
that
i
should
succeed
i
started
with
surprise
for
it
seemed
as
if
success
had
crowned
my
attempts
i
repeated
the
effort
but
failed
a
certain
position
of
the
organs
took
place
on
the
first
attempt
altogether
new
unexampled
and
as
it
were
by
accident
for
i
could
not
attain
it
on
the
second
experiment
you
will
not
wonder
that
i
exerted
myself
with
indefatigable
zeal
to
regain
what
had
once
though
for
so
short
a
space
been
in
my
power
your
own
ears
have
witnessed
the
success
of
these
efforts
by
perpetual
exertion
i
gained
it
a
second
time
and
now
was
a
diligent
observer
of
the
circumstances
attending
it
gradually
i
subjected
these
finer
and
more
subtle
motions
to
the
command
of
my
will
what
was
at
first
difficult
by
exercise
and
habit
was
rendered
easy
i
learned
to
accommodate
my
voice
to
all
the
varieties
of
distance
and
direction
it
can
not
be
denied
that
this
faculty
is
wonderful
and
rare
but
when
we
consider
the
possible
modifications
of
muscular
motion
how
few
of
these
are
usually
exerted
how
imperfectly
they
are
subjected
to
the
will
and
yet
that
the
will
is
capable
of
being
rendered
unlimited
and
absolute
will
not
our
wonder
cease
we
have
seen
men
who
could
hide
their
tongues
so
perfectly
that
even
an
anatomist
after
the
most
accurate
inspection
that
a
living
subject
could
admit
has
affirmed
the
organ
to
be
wanting
but
this
was
effected
by
the
exertion
of
muscles
unknown
and
incredible
to
the
greater
part
of
mankind
the
concurrence
of
teeth
palate
and
tongue
in
the
formation
of
speech
should
seem
to
be
indispensable
and
yet
men
have
spoken
distinctly
though
wanting
a
tongue
and
to
whom
therefore
teeth
and
palate
were
superfluous
the
tribe
of
motions
requisite
to
this
end
are
wholly
latent
and
unknown
to
those
who
possess
that
organ
i
mean
not
to
be
more
explicit
i
have
no
reason
to
suppose
a
peculiar
conformation
or
activity
in
my
own
organs
or
that
the
power
which
i
possess
may
not
with
suitable
directions
and
by
steady
efforts
be
obtained
by
others
but
i
will
do
nothing
to
facilitate
the
acquisition
it
is
by
far
too
liable
to
perversion
for
a
good
man
to
desire
to
possess
it
or
to
teach
it
to
another
there
remained
but
one
thing
to
render
this
instrument
as
powerful
in
my
hands
as
it
was
capable
of
being
from
my
childhood
i
was
remarkably
skilful
at
imitation
there
were
few
voices
whether
of
men
or
birds
or
beasts
which
i
could
not
imitate
with
success
to
add
my
ancient
to
my
newly
acquired
skill
to
talk
from
a
distance
and
at
the
same
time
in
the
accents
of
another
was
the
object
of
my
endeavours
and
this
object
after
a
certain
number
of
trials
i
finally
obtained
in
my
present
situation
every
thing
that
denoted
intellectual
exertion
was
a
crime
and
exposed
me
to
invectives
if
not
to
stripes
this
circumstance
induced
me
to
be
silent
to
all
others
on
the
subject
of
my
discovery
but
added
to
this
was
a
confused
belief
that
it
might
be
made
in
some
way
instrumental
to
my
relief
from
the
hardships
and
restraints
of
my
present
condition
for
some
time
i
was
not
aware
of
the
mode
in
which
it
might
be
rendered
subservient
to
this
end
chapter
ii
my
father
sister
was
an
ancient
lady
resident
in
philadelphia
the
relict
of
a
merchant
whose
decease
left
her
the
enjoyment
of
a
frugal
competence
she
was
without
children
and
had
often
expressed
her
desire
that
her
nephew
frank
whom
she
always
considered
as
a
sprightly
and
promising
lad
should
be
put
under
her
care
she
offered
to
be
at
the
expense
of
my
education
and
to
bequeath
to
me
at
her
death
her
slender
patrimony
this
arrangement
was
obstinately
rejected
by
my
father
because
it
was
merely
fostering
and
giving
scope
to
propensities
which
he
considered
as
hurtful
and
because
his
avarice
desired
that
this
inheritance
should
fall
to
no
one
but
himself
to
me
it
was
a
scheme
of
ravishing
felicity
and
to
be
debarred
from
it
was
a
source
of
anguish
known
to
few
i
had
too
much
experience
of
my
father
pertinaciousness
ever
to
hope
for
a
change
in
his
views
yet
the
bliss
of
living
with
my
aunt
in
a
new
and
busy
scene
and
in
the
unbounded
indulgence
of
my
literary
passion
continually
occupied
my
thoughts
for
a
long
time
these
thoughts
were
productive
only
of
despondency
and
tears
time
only
enhanced
the
desirableness
of
this
scheme
my
new
faculty
would
naturally
connect
itself
with
these
wishes
and
the
question
could
not
fail
to
occur
whether
it
might
not
aid
me
in
the
execution
of
my
favourite
plan
a
thousand
superstitious
tales
were
current
in
the
family
apparitions
had
been
seen
and
voices
had
been
heard
on
a
multitude
of
occasions
my
father
was
a
confident
believer
in
supernatural
tokens
the
voice
of
his
wife
who
had
been
many
years
dead
had
been
twice
heard
at
midnight
whispering
at
his
pillow
i
frequently
asked
myself
whether
a
scheme
favourable
to
my
views
might
not
be
built
upon
these
foundations
suppose
thought
i
my
mother
should
be
made
to
enjoin
upon
him
compliance
with
my
wishes
this
idea
bred
in
me
a
temporary
consternation
to
imitate
the
voice
of
the
dead
to
counterfeit
a
commission
from
heaven
bore
the
aspect
of
presumption
and
impiety
it
seemed
an
offence
which
could
not
fail
to
draw
after
it
the
vengeance
of
the
deity
my
wishes
for
a
time
yielded
to
my
fears
but
this
scheme
in
proportion
as
i
meditated
on
it
became
more
plausible
no
other
occurred
to
me
so
easy
and
so
efficacious
i
endeavoured
to
persuade
myself
that
the
end
proposed
was
in
the
highest
degree
praiseworthy
and
that
the
excellence
of
my
purpose
would
justify
the
means
employed
to
attain
it
my
resolutions
were
for
a
time
attended
with
fluctuations
and
misgivings
these
gradually
disappeared
and
my
purpose
became
firm
i
was
next
to
devise
the
means
of
effecting
my
views
this
did
not
demand
any
tedious
deliberation
it
was
easy
to
gain
access
to
my
chamber
without
notice
or
detection
cautious
footsteps
and
the
suppression
of
breath
would
place
me
unsuspected
and
unthought
of
by
his
bed
side
the
words
i
should
use
and
the
mode
of
utterance
were
not
easily
settled
but
having
at
length
selected
these
i
made
myself
by
much
previous
repetition
perfectly
familiar
with
the
use
of
them
i
selected
a
blustering
and
inclement
night
in
which
the
darkness
was
augmented
by
a
veil
of
the
blackest
clouds
the
building
we
inhabited
was
slight
in
its
structure
and
full
of
crevices
through
which
the
gale
found
easy
way
and
whistled
in
a
thousand
cadences
on
this
night
the
elemental
music
was
remarkably
sonorous
and
was
mingled
not
unfrequently
with
heard
i
could
not
divest
myself
of
secret
dread
my
heart
faultered
with
a
consciousness
of
wrong
heaven
seemed
to
be
present
and
to
disapprove
my
work
i
listened
to
the
thunder
and
the
wind
as
to
the
stern
voice
of
this
disapprobation
big
drops
stood
on
my
forehead
and
my
tremors
almost
incapacitated
me
from
proceeding
these
impediments
however
i
surmounted
i
crept
up
stairs
at
midnight
and
entered
my
father
chamber
the
darkness
was
intense
and
i
sought
with
outstretched
hands
for
his
bed
the
darkness
added
to
the
trepidation
of
my
thoughts
disabled
me
from
making
a
right
estimate
of
distances
i
was
conscious
of
this
and
when
i
advanced
within
the
room
paused
i
endeavoured
to
compare
the
progress
i
had
made
with
my
knowledge
of
the
room
and
governed
by
the
result
of
this
comparison
proceeded
cautiously
and
with
hands
still
outstretched
in
search
of
the
foot
of
the
bed
at
this
moment
lightning
flashed
into
the
room
the
brightness
of
the
gleam
was
dazzling
yet
it
afforded
me
an
exact
knowledge
of
my
situation
i
had
mistaken
my
way
and
discovered
that
my
knees
nearly
touched
the
bedstead
and
that
my
hands
at
the
next
step
would
have
touched
my
father
cheek
his
closed
eyes
and
every
line
in
his
countenance
were
painted
as
it
were
for
an
instant
on
my
sight
the
flash
was
accompanied
with
a
burst
of
thunder
whose
vehemence
was
stunning
i
always
entertained
a
dread
of
thunder
and
now
recoiled
overborne
with
terror
never
had
i
witnessed
so
luminous
a
gleam
and
so
tremendous
a
shock
yet
my
father
slumber
appeared
not
to
be
disturbed
by
it
i
stood
irresolute
and
trembling
to
prosecute
my
purpose
in
this
state
of
mind
was
impossible
i
resolved
for
the
present
to
relinquish
it
and
turned
with
a
view
of
exploring
my
way
out
of
the
chamber
just
then
a
light
seen
through
the
window
caught
my
eye
it
was
at
first
weak
but
speedily
increased
no
second
thought
was
necessary
to
inform
me
that
the
barn
situated
at
a
small
distance
from
the
house
and
newly
stored
with
hay
was
in
flames
in
consequence
of
being
struck
by
the
lightning
my
terror
at
this
spectacle
made
me
careless
of
all
consequences
relative
to
myself
i
rushed
to
the
bed
and
throwing
myself
on
my
father
awakened
him
by
loud
cries
the
family
were
speedily
roused
and
were
compelled
to
remain
impotent
spectators
of
the
devastation
fortunately
the
wind
blew
in
a
contrary
direction
so
that
our
habitation
was
not
injured
the
impression
that
was
made
upon
me
by
the
incidents
of
that
night
is
indelible
the
wind
gradually
rose
into
an
hurricane
the
largest
branches
were
torn
from
the
trees
and
whirled
aloft
into
the
air
others
were
uprooted
and
laid
prostrate
on
the
ground
the
barn
was
a
spacious
edifice
consisting
wholly
of
wood
and
filled
with
a
plenteous
harvest
thus
supplied
with
fuel
and
fanned
by
the
wind
the
fire
raged
with
incredible
fury
meanwhile
clouds
rolled
above
whose
blackness
was
rendered
more
conspicuous
by
reflection
from
the
flames
the
vast
volumes
of
smoke
were
dissipated
in
a
moment
by
the
storm
while
glowing
fragments
and
cinders
were
borne
to
an
immense
hight
and
tossed
everywhere
in
wild
confusion
ever
and
anon
the
sable
canopy
that
hung
around
us
was
streaked
with
lightning
and
the
peals
by
which
it
was
accompanied
were
deafning
and
with
scarcely
any
intermission
it
was
doubtless
absurd
to
imagine
any
connexion
between
this
portentous
scene
and
the
purpose
that
i
had
meditated
yet
a
belief
of
this
connexion
though
wavering
and
obscure
lurked
in
my
mind
something
more
than
a
coincidence
merely
casual
appeared
to
have
subsisted
between
my
situation
at
my
father
bed
side
and
the
flash
that
darted
through
the
window
and
diverted
me
from
my
design
it
palsied
my
courage
and
strengthened
my
conviction
that
my
scheme
was
criminal
after
some
time
had
elapsed
and
tranquility
was
in
some
degree
restored
in
the
family
my
father
reverted
to
the
circumstances
in
which
i
had
been
discovered
on
the
first
alarm
of
this
event
the
truth
was
impossible
to
be
told
i
felt
the
utmost
reluctance
to
be
guilty
of
a
falsehood
but
by
falsehood
only
could
i
elude
detection
that
my
guilt
was
the
offspring
of
a
fatal
necessity
that
the
injustice
of
others
gave
it
birth
and
made
it
unavoidable
afforded
me
slight
consolation
nothing
can
be
more
injurious
than
a
lie
but
its
evil
tendency
chiefly
respects
our
future
conduct
its
direct
consequences
may
be
transient
and
few
but
it
facilitates
a
repetition
strengthens
temptation
and
grows
into
habit
i
pretended
some
necessity
had
drawn
me
from
my
bed
and
that
discovering
the
condition
of
the
barn
i
hastened
to
inform
my
father
some
time
after
this
my
father
summoned
me
to
his
presence
i
had
been
previously
guilty
of
disobedience
to
his
commands
in
a
matter
about
which
he
was
usually
very
scrupulous
my
brother
had
been
privy
to
my
offence
and
had
threatened
to
be
my
accuser
on
this
occasion
i
expected
nothing
but
arraignment
and
punishment
weary
of
oppression
and
hopeless
of
any
change
in
my
father
temper
and
views
i
had
formed
the
resolution
of
eloping
from
his
house
and
of
trusting
young
as
i
was
to
the
caprice
of
fortune
i
was
hesitating
whether
to
abscond
without
the
knowledge
of
the
family
or
to
make
my
resolutions
known
to
them
and
while
i
avowed
my
resolution
to
adhere
to
it
in
spite
of
opposition
and
remonstrances
when
i
received
this
summons
i
was
employed
at
this
time
in
the
field
night
was
approaching
and
i
had
made
no
preparation
for
departure
all
the
preparation
in
my
power
to
make
was
indeed
small
a
few
clothes
made
into
a
bundle
was
the
sum
of
my
possessions
time
would
have
little
influence
in
improving
my
prospects
and
i
resolved
to
execute
my
scheme
immediately
i
left
my
work
intending
to
seek
my
chamber
and
taking
what
was
my
own
to
disappear
forever
i
turned
a
stile
that
led
out
of
the
field
into
a
bye
path
when
my
father
appeared
before
me
advancing
in
an
opposite
direction
to
avoid
him
was
impossible
and
i
summoned
my
fortitude
to
a
conflict
with
his
passion
as
soon
as
we
met
instead
of
anger
and
upbraiding
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
reflecting
on
my
aunt
proposal
to
take
me
under
her
protection
and
had
concluded
that
the
plan
was
proper
if
i
still
retained
my
wishes
on
that
head
he
would
readily
comply
with
them
and
that
if
i
chose
i
might
set
off
for
the
city
next
morning
as
a
neighbours
waggon
was
preparing
to
go
i
shall
not
dwell
on
the
rapture
with
which
this
proposal
was
listened
to
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
persuaded
myself
that
he
was
in
earnest
in
making
it
nor
could
divine
the
reasons
for
so
sudden
and
unexpected
a
change
in
his
maxims
these
i
afterwards
discovered
some
one
had
instilled
into
him
fears
that
my
aunt
exasperated
at
his
opposition
to
her
request
respecting
the
unfortunate
frank
would
bequeath
her
property
to
strangers
to
obviate
this
evil
which
his
avarice
prompted
him
to
regard
as
much
greater
than
any
mischief
that
would
accrue
to
me
from
the
change
of
my
abode
he
embraced
her
proposal
i
entered
with
exultation
and
triumph
on
this
new
scene
my
hopes
were
by
no
means
disappointed
detested
labour
was
exchanged
for
luxurious
idleness
i
was
master
of
my
time
and
the
chuser
of
my
occupations
my
kinswoman
on
discovering
that
i
entertained
no
relish
for
the
drudgery
of
colleges
and
was
contented
with
the
means
of
intellectual
gratification
which
i
could
obtain
under
her
roof
allowed
me
to
pursue
my
own
choice
three
tranquil
years
passed
away
during
which
each
day
added
to
my
happiness
by
adding
to
my
knowledge
my
biloquial
faculty
was
not
neglected
i
improved
it
by
assiduous
exercise
i
deeply
reflected
on
the
use
to
which
it
might
be
applied
i
was
not
destitute
of
pure
intentions
i
delighted
not
in
evil
i
was
incapable
of
knowingly
contributing
to
another
misery
but
the
sole
or
principal
end
of
my
endeavours
was
not
the
happiness
of
others
i
was
actuated
by
ambition
i
was
delighted
to
possess
superior
power
i
was
prone
to
manifest
that
superiority
and
was
satisfied
if
this
were
done
without
much
solicitude
concerning
consequences
i
sported
frequently
with
the
apprehensions
of
my
associates
and
threw
out
a
bait
for
their
wonder
and
supplied
them
with
occasions
for
the
structure
of
theories
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
enumerate
one
or
two
adventures
in
which
i
was
engaged
chapter
iii
i
had
taken
much
pains
to
improve
the
sagacity
of
a
favourite
spaniel
it
was
my
purpose
indeed
to
ascertain
to
what
degree
of
improvement
the
principles
of
reasoning
and
imitation
could
be
carried
in
a
dog
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
animal
affixes
distinct
ideas
to
sounds
what
are
the
possible
limits
of
his
vocabulary
no
one
can
tell
in
conversing
with
my
dog
i
did
not
use
english
words
but
selected
simple
monosyllables
habit
likewise
enabled
him
to
comprehend
my
gestures
if
i
crossed
my
hands
on
my
breast
he
understood
the
signal
and
laid
down
behind
me
if
i
joined
my
hands
and
lifted
them
to
my
breast
he
returned
home
if
i
grasped
one
arm
above
the
elbow
he
ran
before
me
if
i
lifted
my
hand
to
my
forehead
he
trotted
composedly
behind
by
one
motion
i
could
make
him
bark
by
another
i
could
reduce
him
to
silence
he
would
howl
in
twenty
different
strains
of
mournfulness
at
my
bidding
he
would
fetch
and
carry
with
undeviating
faithfulness
his
actions
being
thus
chiefly
regulated
by
gestures
that
to
a
stranger
would
appear
indifferent
or
casual
it
was
easy
to
produce
a
belief
that
the
animal
knowledge
was
much
greater
than
in
truth
it
was
one
day
in
a
mixed
company
the
discourse
turned
upon
the
unrivaled
abilities
of
damon
had
indeed
acquired
in
all
the
circles
which
i
frequented
an
extraordinary
reputation
numerous
instances
of
his
sagacity
were
quoted
and
some
of
them
exhibited
on
the
spot
much
surprise
was
excited
by
the
readiness
with
which
he
appeared
to
comprehend
sentences
of
considerable
abstraction
and
complexity
though
he
in
reality
attended
to
nothing
but
the
movements
of
hand
or
fingers
with
which
i
accompanied
my
words
i
enhanced
the
astonishment
of
some
and
excited
the
ridicule
of
others
by
observing
that
my
dog
not
only
understood
english
when
spoken
by
others
but
actually
spoke
the
language
himself
with
no
small
degree
of
precision
this
assertion
could
not
be
admitted
without
proof
proof
therefore
was
readily
produced
at
a
known
signal
damon
began
a
low
interrupted
noise
in
which
the
astonished
hearers
clearly
distinguished
english
words
a
dialogue
began
between
the
animal
and
his
master
which
was
maintained
on
the
part
of
the
former
with
great
vivacity
and
spirit
in
this
dialogue
the
dog
asserted
the
dignity
of
his
species
and
capacity
of
intellectual
improvement
the
company
separated
lost
in
wonder
but
perfectly
convinced
by
the
evidence
that
had
been
produced
on
a
subsequent
occasion
a
select
company
was
assembled
at
a
garden
at
a
small
distance
from
the
city
discourse
glided
through
a
variety
of
topics
till
it
lighted
at
length
on
the
subject
of
invisible
beings
from
the
speculations
of
philosophers
we
proceeded
to
the
creations
of
the
poet
some
maintained
the
justness
of
shakspear
delineations
of
aerial
beings
while
others
denied
it
by
no
violent
transition
ariel
and
his
songs
were
introduced
and
a
lady
celebrated
for
her
musical
skill
was
solicited
to
accompany
her
pedal
harp
with
the
song
of
five
fathom
deep
thy
father
lies
she
was
known
to
have
set
for
her
favourite
instrument
all
the
songs
of
shakspeare
my
youth
made
me
little
more
than
an
auditor
on
this
occasion
i
sat
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
company
and
carefully
noted
every
thing
the
track
which
the
conversation
had
taken
suggested
a
scheme
which
was
not
thoroughly
digested
when
the
lady
began
her
enchanting
strain
she
ended
and
the
audience
were
mute
with
rapture
the
pause
continued
when
a
strain
was
wafted
to
our
ears
from
another
quarter
the
spot
where
we
sat
was
embowered
by
a
vine
the
verdant
arch
was
lofty
and
the
area
beneath
was
spacious
the
sound
proceeded
from
above
at
first
it
was
faint
and
scarcely
audible
presently
it
reached
a
louder
key
and
every
eye
was
cast
up
in
expectation
of
beholding
a
face
among
the
pendant
clusters
the
strain
was
easily
recognized
for
it
was
no
other
than
that
which
ariel
is
made
to
sing
when
finally
absolved
from
the
service
of
the
wizard
in
the
cowslips
bell
i
lie
on
the
bat
back
i
do
fly
after
summer
merrily
their
hearts
palpitated
as
they
listened
they
gazed
at
each
other
for
a
solution
of
the
mystery
at
length
the
strain
died
away
at
distance
and
an
interval
of
silence
was
succeded
by
an
earnest
discussion
of
the
cause
of
this
prodigy
one
supposition
only
could
be
adopted
which
was
that
the
strain
was
uttered
by
human
organs
that
the
songster
was
stationed
on
the
roof
of
the
arbour
and
having
finished
his
melody
had
risen
into
the
viewless
fields
of
air
i
had
been
invited
to
spend
a
week
at
this
house
this
period
was
nearly
expired
when
i
received
information
that
my
aunt
was
suddenly
taken
sick
and
that
her
life
was
in
imminent
danger
i
immediately
set
out
on
my
return
to
the
city
but
before
my
arrival
she
was
dead
this
lady
was
entitled
to
my
gratitude
and
esteem
i
had
received
the
most
essential
benefits
at
her
hand
i
was
not
destitute
of
sensibility
and
was
deeply
affected
by
this
event
i
will
own
however
that
my
grief
was
lessened
by
reflecting
on
the
consequences
of
her
death
with
regard
to
my
own
condition
i
had
been
ever
taught
to
consider
myself
as
her
heir
and
her
death
therefore
would
free
me
from
certain
restraints
my
aunt
had
a
female
servant
who
had
lived
with
her
for
twenty
years
she
was
married
but
her
husband
who
was
an
artizan
lived
apart
from
her
i
had
no
reason
to
suspect
the
woman
sincerity
and
disinterestedness
but
my
aunt
was
no
sooner
consigned
to
the
grave
than
a
will
was
produced
in
which
dorothy
was
named
her
sole
and
universal
heir
it
was
in
vain
to
urge
my
expectations
and
my
claims
the
instrument
was
legibly
and
legally
drawn
up
dorothy
was
exasperated
by
my
opposition
and
surmises
and
vigorously
enforced
her
title
in
a
week
after
the
decease
of
my
kinswoman
i
was
obliged
to
seek
a
new
dwelling
as
all
my
property
consisted
in
my
cloths
and
my
papers
this
was
easily
done
my
condition
was
now
calamitous
and
forlorn
confiding
in
the
acquisition
of
my
aunt
patrimony
i
had
made
no
other
provision
for
the
future
i
hated
manual
labour
or
any
task
of
which
the
object
was
gain
to
be
guided
in
my
choice
of
occupations
by
any
motive
but
the
pleasure
which
the
occupation
was
qualified
to
produce
was
intolerable
to
my
proud
indolent
and
restive
temper
this
resource
was
now
cut
off
the
means
of
immediate
subsistence
were
denied
me
if
i
had
determined
to
acquire
the
knowledge
of
some
lucrative
art
the
acquisition
would
demand
time
and
meanwhile
i
was
absolutely
destitute
of
support
my
father
house
was
indeed
open
to
me
but
i
preferred
to
stifle
myself
with
the
filth
of
the
kennel
rather
than
to
return
to
it
some
plan
it
was
immediately
necessary
to
adopt
the
exigence
of
my
affairs
and
this
reverse
of
fortune
continually
occupied
my
thoughts
i
estranged
myself
from
society
and
from
books
and
devoted
myself
to
lonely
walks
and
mournful
meditation
one
morning
as
i
ranged
along
the
bank
of
schuylkill
i
encountered
a
person
by
name
ludloe
of
whom
i
had
some
previous
knowledge
he
was
from
ireland
was
a
man
of
some
rank
and
apparently
rich
i
had
met
with
him
before
but
in
mixed
companies
where
little
direct
intercourse
had
taken
place
between
us
our
last
meeting
was
in
the
arbour
where
ariel
was
so
unexpectedly
introduced
our
acquaintance
merely
justified
a
transient
salutation
but
he
did
not
content
himself
with
noticing
me
as
i
passed
but
joined
me
in
my
walk
and
entered
into
conversation
it
was
easy
to
advert
to
the
occasion
on
which
we
had
last
met
and
to
the
mysterious
incident
which
then
occurred
i
was
solicitous
to
dive
into
his
thoughts
upon
this
head
and
put
some
questions
which
tended
to
the
point
that
i
wished
i
was
somewhat
startled
when
he
expressed
his
belief
that
the
performer
of
this
mystic
strain
was
one
of
the
company
then
present
who
exerted
for
this
end
a
faculty
not
commonly
possessed
who
this
person
was
he
did
not
venture
to
guess
and
could
not
discover
by
the
tokens
which
he
suffered
to
appear
that
his
suspicions
glanced
at
me
he
expatiated
with
great
profoundness
and
fertility
of
ideas
on
the
uses
to
which
a
faculty
like
this
might
be
employed
no
more
powerful
engine
he
said
could
be
conceived
by
which
the
ignorant
and
credulous
might
be
moulded
to
our
purposes
managed
by
a
man
of
ordinary
talents
it
would
open
for
him
the
straightest
and
surest
avenues
to
wealth
and
power
his
remarks
excited
in
my
mind
a
new
strain
of
thoughts
i
had
not
hitherto
considered
the
subject
in
this
light
though
vague
ideas
of
the
importance
of
this
art
could
not
fail
to
be
occasionally
suggested
i
ventured
to
inquire
into
his
ideas
of
the
mode
in
which
an
art
like
this
could
be
employed
so
as
to
effect
the
purposes
he
mentioned
he
dealt
chiefly
in
general
representations
men
he
said
believed
in
the
existence
and
energy
of
invisible
powers
and
in
the
duty
of
discovering
and
conforming
to
their
will
this
will
was
supposed
to
be
sometimes
made
known
to
them
through
the
medium
of
their
senses
a
voice
coming
from
a
quarter
where
no
attendant
form
could
be
seen
would
in
most
cases
be
ascribed
to
supernal
agency
and
a
command
imposed
on
them
in
this
manner
would
be
obeyed
with
religious
scrupulousness
thus
men
might
be
imperiously
directed
in
the
disposal
of
their
industry
their
property
and
even
of
their
lives
men
actuated
by
a
mistaken
sense
of
duty
might
under
this
influence
be
led
to
the
commission
of
the
most
flagitious
as
well
as
the
most
heroic
acts
if
it
were
his
desire
to
accumulate
wealth
or
institute
a
new
sect
he
should
need
no
other
instrument
i
listened
to
this
kind
of
discourse
with
great
avidity
and
regretted
when
he
thought
proper
to
introduce
new
topics
he
ended
by
requesting
me
to
visit
him
which
i
eagerly
consented
to
do
when
left
alone
my
imagination
was
filled
with
the
images
suggested
by
this
conversation
the
hopelessness
of
better
fortune
which
i
had
lately
harboured
now
gave
place
to
cheering
confidence
those
motives
of
rectitude
which
should
deter
me
from
this
species
of
imposture
had
never
been
vivid
or
stable
and
were
still
more
weakened
by
the
artifices
of
which
i
had
already
been
guilty
the
utility
or
harmlessness
of
the
end
justified
in
my
eyes
the
means
no
event
had
been
more
unexpected
by
me
than
the
bequest
of
my
aunt
to
her
servant
the
will
under
which
the
latter
claimed
was
dated
prior
to
my
coming
to
the
city
i
was
not
surprised
therefore
that
it
had
once
been
made
but
merely
that
it
had
never
been
cancelled
or
superseded
by
a
later
instrument
my
wishes
inclined
me
to
suspect
the
existence
of
a
later
will
but
i
had
conceived
that
to
ascertain
its
existence
was
beyond
my
power
now
however
a
different
opinion
began
to
be
entertained
this
woman
like
those
of
her
sex
and
class
was
unlettered
and
superstitious
her
faith
in
spells
and
apparitions
was
of
the
most
lively
kind
could
not
her
conscience
be
awakened
by
a
voice
from
the
grave
lonely
and
at
midnight
my
aunt
might
be
introduced
upbraiding
her
for
her
injustice
and
commanding
her
to
attone
for
it
by
acknowledging
the
claim
of
the
rightful
proprietor
true
it
was
that
no
subsequent
will
might
exist
but
this
was
the
fruit
of
mistake
or
of
negligence
she
probably
intended
to
cancel
the
old
one
but
this
act
might
by
her
own
weakness
or
by
the
artifices
of
her
servant
be
delayed
till
death
had
put
it
out
of
her
power
in
either
case
a
mandate
from
the
dead
could
scarcely
fail
of
being
obeyed
i
considered
this
woman
as
the
usurper
of
my
property
her
husband
as
well
as
herself
were
laborious
and
covetous
their
good
fortune
had
made
no
change
in
their
mode
of
living
but
they
were
as
frugal
and
as
eager
to
accumulate
as
ever
in
their
hands
money
was
inert
and
sterile
or
it
served
to
foster
their
vices
to
take
it
from
them
would
therefore
be
a
benefit
both
to
them
and
to
myself
not
even
an
imaginary
injury
would
be
inflicted
restitution
if
legally
compelled
to
it
would
be
reluctant
and
painful
but
if
enjoined
by
heaven
would
be
voluntary
and
the
performance
of
a
seeming
duty
would
carry
with
it
its
own
reward
these
reasonings
aided
by
inclination
were
sufficient
to
determine
me
i
have
no
doubt
but
their
fallacy
would
have
been
detected
in
the
sequel
and
my
scheme
have
been
productive
of
nothing
but
confusion
and
remorse
from
these
consequences
however
my
fate
interposed
as
in
the
former
instance
to
save
me
having
formed
my
resolution
many
preliminaries
to
its
execution
were
necessary
to
be
settled
these
demanded
deliberation
and
delay
meanwhile
i
recollected
my
promise
to
ludlow
and
paid
him
a
visit
i
met
a
frank
and
affectionate
reception
it
would
not
be
easy
to
paint
the
delight
which
i
experienced
in
this
man
society
i
was
at
first
oppressed
with
the
sense
of
my
own
inferiority
in
age
knowledge
and
rank
hence
arose
numberless
reserves
and
incapacitating
diffidences
but
these
were
speedily
dissipated
by
the
fascinations
of
this
address
his
superiority
was
only
rendered
by
time
more
conspicuous
but
this
superiority
by
appearing
never
to
be
present
to
his
own
mind
ceased
to
be
uneasy
to
me
my
questions
required
to
be
frequently
answered
and
my
mistakes
to
be
rectified
but
my
keenest
scrutiny
could
detect
in
his
manner
neither
arrogance
nor
contempt
he
seemed
to
talk
merely
from
the
overflow
of
his
ideas
or
a
benevolent
desire
of
imparting
information
chapter
iv
my
visits
gradually
became
more
frequent
meanwhile
my
wants
increased
and
the
necessity
of
some
change
in
my
condition
became
daily
more
urgent
this
incited
my
reflections
on
the
scheme
which
i
had
formed
the
time
and
place
suitable
to
my
design
were
not
selected
without
much
anxious
inquiry
and
frequent
waverings
of
purpose
these
being
at
length
fixed
the
interval
to
elapse
before
the
carrying
of
my
design
into
effect
was
not
without
perturbation
and
suspense
these
could
not
be
concealed
from
my
new
friend
and
at
length
prompted
him
to
inquire
into
the
cause
it
was
not
possible
to
communicate
the
whole
truth
but
the
warmth
of
his
manner
inspired
me
with
some
degree
of
ingenuousness
i
did
not
hide
from
him
my
former
hopes
and
my
present
destitute
condition
he
listened
to
my
tale
with
no
expressions
of
sympathy
and
when
i
had
finished
abruptly
inquired
whether
i
had
any
objection
to
a
voyage
to
europe
i
answered
in
the
negative
he
then
said
that
he
was
preparing
to
depart
in
a
fortnight
and
advised
me
to
make
up
my
mind
to
accompany
him
this
unexpected
proposal
gave
me
pleasure
and
surprize
but
the
want
of
money
occurred
to
me
as
an
insuperable
objection
on
this
being
mentioned
oho
said
he
carelessly
that
objection
is
easily
removed
i
will
bear
all
expenses
of
your
passage
myself
the
extraordinary
beneficence
of
this
act
as
well
as
the
air
of
uncautiousness
attending
it
made
me
doubt
the
sincerity
of
his
offer
and
when
new
declarations
removed
this
doubt
i
could
not
forbear
expressing
at
once
my
sense
of
his
generosity
and
of
my
own
unworthiness
he
replied
that
generosity
had
been
expunged
from
his
catalogue
as
having
no
meaning
or
a
vicious
one
it
was
the
scope
of
his
exertions
to
be
just
this
was
the
sum
of
human
duty
and
he
that
fell
short
ran
beside
or
outstripped
justice
was
a
criminal
what
he
gave
me
was
my
due
or
not
my
due
if
it
were
my
due
i
might
reasonably
demand
it
from
him
and
it
was
wicked
to
withhold
it
merit
on
one
side
or
gratitude
on
the
other
were
contradictory
and
unintelligible
if
i
were
fully
convinced
that
this
benefit
was
not
my
due
and
yet
received
it
he
should
hold
me
in
contempt
the
rectitude
of
my
principles
and
conduct
would
be
the
measure
of
his
approbation
and
no
benefit
should
he
ever
bestow
which
the
receiver
was
not
entitled
to
claim
and
which
it
would
not
be
criminal
in
him
to
refuse
these
principles
were
not
new
from
the
mouth
of
ludloe
but
they
had
hitherto
been
regarded
as
the
fruits
of
a
venturous
speculation
in
my
mind
i
had
never
traced
them
into
their
practical
consequences
and
if
his
conduct
on
this
occasion
had
not
squared
with
his
maxims
i
should
not
have
imputed
to
him
inconsistency
i
did
not
ponder
on
these
reasonings
at
this
time
objects
of
immediate
importance
engrossed
my
thoughts
one
obstacle
to
this
measure
was
removed
when
my
voyage
was
performed
how
should
i
subsist
in
my
new
abode
i
concealed
not
my
perplexity
and
he
commented
on
it
in
his
usual
manner
how
did
i
mean
to
subsist
he
asked
in
my
own
country
the
means
of
living
would
be
at
least
as
much
within
my
reach
there
as
here
as
to
the
pressure
of
immediate
and
absolute
want
he
believed
i
should
be
exposed
to
little
hazard
with
talents
such
as
mine
i
must
be
hunted
by
a
destiny
peculiarly
malignant
if
i
could
not
provide
myself
with
necessaries
wherever
my
lot
were
cast
he
would
make
allowances
however
for
my
diffidence
and
and
would
obviate
my
fears
by
expressing
his
own
intentions
with
regard
to
me
i
must
be
apprized
however
of
his
true
meaning
he
laboured
to
shun
all
hurtful
and
vitious
things
and
therefore
carefully
abstained
from
making
or
confiding
it
was
just
to
assist
me
in
this
voyage
and
it
would
probably
be
equally
just
to
continue
to
me
similar
assistance
when
it
was
finished
that
indeed
was
a
subject
in
a
great
degree
within
my
own
cognizance
his
aid
would
be
proportioned
to
my
wants
and
to
my
merits
and
i
had
only
to
take
care
that
my
claims
were
just
for
them
to
be
admitted
this
scheme
could
not
but
appear
to
me
eligible
i
thirsted
after
an
acquaintance
with
new
scenes
my
present
situation
could
not
be
changed
for
a
worse
i
trusted
to
the
constancy
of
ludloe
friendship
to
this
at
least
it
was
better
to
trust
than
to
the
success
of
my
imposture
on
dorothy
which
was
adopted
merely
as
a
desperate
expedient
finally
i
determined
to
embark
with
him
in
the
course
of
this
voyage
my
mind
was
busily
employed
there
were
no
other
passengers
beside
ourselves
so
that
my
own
condition
and
the
character
of
ludloe
continually
presented
themselves
to
my
reflections
it
will
be
supposed
that
i
was
not
a
vague
or
indifferent
observer
there
were
no
vicissitudes
in
the
deportment
or
lapses
in
the
discourse
of
my
friend
his
feelings
appeared
to
preserve
an
unchangeable
tenor
and
his
thoughts
and
words
always
to
flow
with
the
same
rapidity
his
slumber
was
profound
and
his
wakeful
hours
serene
he
was
regular
and
temperate
in
all
his
exercises
and
gratifications
hence
were
derived
his
clear
perceptions
and
exuberant
health
this
treatment
of
me
like
all
his
other
mental
and
corporal
operations
was
modelled
by
one
inflexible
standard
certain
scruples
and
delicacies
were
incident
to
my
situation
of
the
existence
of
these
he
seemed
to
be
unconscious
and
yet
nothing
escaped
him
inconsistent
with
a
state
of
absolute
equality
i
was
naturally
inquisitive
as
to
his
fortune
and
the
collateral
circumstances
of
his
condition
my
notions
of
politeness
hindered
me
from
making
direct
inquiries
by
indirect
means
i
could
gather
nothing
but
that
his
state
was
opulent
and
independent
and
that
he
had
two
sisters
whose
situation
resembled
his
own
though
in
conversation
he
appeared
to
be
governed
by
the
utmost
candour
no
light
was
let
in
upon
the
former
transactions
of
his
life
the
purpose
of
his
visit
to
america
i
could
merely
guess
to
be
the
gratification
of
curiosity
my
future
pursuits
must
be
supposed
chiefly
to
occupy
my
attention
on
this
head
i
was
destitute
of
all
stedfast
views
without
profession
or
habits
of
industry
or
sources
of
permanent
revenue
the
world
appeared
to
me
an
ocean
on
which
my
bark
was
set
afloat
without
compass
or
sail
the
world
into
which
i
was
about
to
enter
was
untried
and
unknown
and
though
i
could
consent
to
profit
by
the
guidance
i
was
unwilling
to
rely
on
the
support
of
others
this
topic
being
nearest
my
heart
i
frequently
introduced
into
conversation
with
my
friend
but
on
this
subject
he
always
allowed
himself
to
be
led
by
me
while
on
all
others
he
was
zealous
to
point
the
way
to
every
scheme
that
i
proposed
he
was
sure
to
cause
objections
all
the
liberal
professions
were
censured
as
perverting
the
understanding
by
giving
scope
to
the
sordid
motive
of
gain
or
embuing
the
mind
with
erroneous
principles
skill
was
slowly
obtained
and
success
though
integrity
and
independence
must
be
given
for
it
dubious
and
instable
the
mechanical
trades
were
equally
obnoxious
they
were
vitious
by
contributing
to
the
spurious
gratifications
of
the
rich
and
multiplying
the
objects
of
luxury
they
were
destruction
to
the
intellect
and
vigor
of
the
artizan
they
enervated
his
frame
and
brutalized
his
mind
when
i
pointed
out
to
him
the
necessity
of
some
species
of
labour
he
tacitly
admitted
that
necessity
but
refused
to
direct
me
in
the
choice
of
a
pursuit
which
though
not
free
from
defect
should
yet
have
the
fewest
inconveniences
he
dwelt
on
the
fewness
of
our
actual
wants
the
temptations
which
attend
the
possession
of
wealth
the
benefits
of
seclusion
and
privacy
and
the
duty
of
unfettering
our
minds
from
the
prejudices
which
govern
the
world
his
discourse
tended
merely
to
unsettle
my
views
and
increase
my
perplexity
this
effect
was
so
uniform
that
i
at
length
desisted
from
all
allusions
to
this
theme
and
endeavoured
to
divert
my
own
reflections
from
it
when
our
voyage
should
be
finished
and
i
should
actually
tread
this
new
stage
i
believed
that
i
should
be
better
qualified
to
judge
of
the
measures
to
be
taken
by
me
at
length
we
reached
belfast
from
thence
we
immediately
repaired
to
dublin
i
was
admitted
as
a
member
of
his
family
when
i
expressed
my
uncertainty
as
to
the
place
to
which
it
would
be
proper
for
me
to
repair
he
gave
me
a
blunt
but
cordial
invitation
to
his
house
my
circumstances
allowed
me
no
option
and
i
readily
complied
my
attention
was
for
a
time
engrossed
by
a
diversified
succession
of
new
objects
their
novelty
however
disappearing
left
me
at
liberty
to
turn
my
eyes
upon
myself
and
my
companion
and
here
my
reflections
were
supplied
with
abundant
food
his
house
was
spacious
and
commodious
and
furnished
with
profusion
and
elegance
a
suit
of
apartments
was
assigned
to
me
in
which
i
was
permitted
to
reign
uncontroled
and
access
was
permitted
to
a
well
furnished
library
my
food
was
furnished
in
my
own
room
prepared
in
the
manner
which
i
had
previously
directed
occasionally
ludloe
would
request
my
company
to
breakfast
when
an
hour
was
usually
consumed
in
earnest
or
sprightly
conversation
at
all
other
times
he
was
invisible
and
his
apartments
being
wholly
separate
from
mine
i
had
no
opportunity
of
discovering
in
what
way
his
hours
were
employed
he
defended
this
mode
of
living
as
being
most
compatible
with
liberty
he
delighted
to
expatiate
on
the
evils
of
cohabitation
men
subjected
to
the
same
regimen
compelled
to
eat
and
sleep
and
associate
at
certain
hours
were
strangers
to
all
rational
independence
and
liberty
society
would
never
be
exempt
from
servitude
and
misery
till
those
artificial
ties
which
held
human
beings
together
under
the
same
roof
were
dissolved
he
endeavoured
to
regulate
his
own
conduct
in
pursuance
of
these
principles
and
to
secure
to
himself
as
much
freedom
as
the
present
regulations
of
society
would
permit
the
same
independence
which
he
claimed
for
himself
he
likewise
extended
to
me
the
distribution
of
my
own
time
the
selection
of
my
own
occupations
and
companions
should
belong
to
myself
but
these
privileges
though
while
listening
to
his
arguments
i
could
not
deny
them
to
be
valuable
i
would
have
willingly
dispensed
with
the
solitude
in
which
i
lived
became
daily
more
painful
i
ate
and
drank
enjoyed
clothing
and
shelter
without
the
exercise
of
forethought
or
industry
i
walked
and
sat
went
out
and
returned
for
as
long
and
at
what
seasons
i
thought
proper
yet
my
condition
was
a
fertile
source
of
discontent
i
felt
myself
removed
to
a
comfortless
and
chilling
distance
from
ludloe
i
wanted
to
share
in
his
occupations
and
views
with
all
his
ingenuousness
of
aspect
and
overflow
of
thoughts
when
he
allowed
me
his
company
i
felt
myself
painfully
bewildered
with
regard
to
his
genuine
condition
and
sentiments
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
introduce
me
to
society
and
without
an
introduction
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
gain
access
to
any
social
circle
or
domestic
fireside
add
to
this
my
own
obscure
prospects
and
dubious
situation
some
regular
intellectual
pursuit
would
render
my
state
less
irksome
but
i
had
hitherto
adopted
no
scheme
of
this
kind
chapter
time
tended
in
no
degree
to
alleviate
my
dissatisfaction
it
increased
till
the
determination
became
at
length
formed
of
opening
my
thoughts
to
ludloe
at
the
next
breakfast
interview
which
took
place
i
introduced
the
subject
and
expatiated
without
reserve
on
the
state
of
my
feelings
i
concluded
with
entreating
him
to
point
out
some
path
in
which
my
talents
might
be
rendered
useful
to
himself
or
to
mankind
after
a
pause
of
some
minutes
he
said
what
would
you
do
you
forget
the
immaturity
of
your
age
if
you
are
qualified
to
act
a
part
in
the
theatre
of
life
step
forth
but
you
are
not
qualified
you
want
knowledge
and
with
this
you
ought
previously
to
endow
yourself
means
for
this
end
are
within
your
reach
why
should
you
waste
your
time
in
idleness
and
torment
yourself
with
unprofitable
wishes
books
are
at
hand
books
from
which
most
sciences
and
languages
can
be
learned
read
analise
digest
collect
facts
and
investigate
theories
ascertain
the
dictates
of
reason
and
supply
yourself
with
the
inclination
and
the
power
to
adhere
to
them
you
will
not
legally
speaking
be
a
man
in
less
than
three
years
let
this
period
be
devoted
to
the
acquisition
of
wisdom
either
stay
here
or
retire
to
an
house
i
have
on
the
banks
of
killarney
where
you
will
find
all
the
conveniences
of
study
i
could
not
but
reflect
with
wonder
at
this
man
treatment
of
me
i
could
plead
none
of
the
rights
of
relationship
yet
i
enjoyed
the
privileges
of
a
son
he
had
not
imparted
to
me
any
scheme
by
pursuit
of
which
i
might
finally
compensate
him
for
the
expense
to
which
my
maintenance
and
education
would
subject
him
he
gave
me
reason
to
hope
for
the
continuance
of
his
bounty
he
talked
and
acted
as
if
my
fortune
were
totally
disjoined
from
his
yet
was
i
indebted
to
him
for
the
morsel
which
sustained
my
life
now
it
was
proposed
to
withdraw
myself
to
studious
leisure
and
romantic
solitude
all
my
wants
personal
and
intellectual
were
to
be
supplied
gratuitously
and
copiously
no
means
were
prescribed
by
which
i
might
make
compensation
for
all
these
benefits
in
conferring
them
he
seemed
to
be
actuated
by
no
view
to
his
own
ultimate
advantage
he
took
no
measures
to
secure
my
future
services
i
suffered
these
thoughts
to
escape
me
on
this
occasion
and
observed
that
to
make
my
application
successful
or
useful
it
was
necessary
to
pursue
some
end
i
must
look
forward
to
some
post
which
i
might
hereafter
occupy
beneficially
to
myself
or
others
and
for
which
all
the
efforts
of
my
mind
should
be
bent
to
qualify
myself
these
hints
gave
him
visible
pleasure
and
now
for
the
first
time
he
deigned
to
advise
me
on
this
head
his
scheme
however
was
not
suddenly
produced
the
way
to
it
was
circuitous
and
long
it
was
his
business
to
make
every
new
step
appear
to
be
suggested
by
my
own
reflections
his
own
ideas
were
the
seeming
result
of
the
moment
and
sprung
out
of
the
last
idea
that
was
uttered
being
hastily
taken
up
they
were
of
course
liable
to
objection
these
objections
sometimes
occurring
to
me
and
sometimes
to
him
were
admitted
or
contested
with
the
utmost
candour
one
scheme
went
through
numerous
modifications
before
it
was
proved
to
be
ineligible
or
before
it
yielded
place
to
a
better
it
was
easy
to
perceive
that
books
alone
were
insufficient
to
impart
knowledge
that
man
must
be
examined
with
our
own
eyes
to
make
us
acquainted
with
their
nature
that
ideas
collected
from
observation
and
reading
must
correct
and
illustrate
each
other
that
the
value
of
all
principles
and
their
truth
lie
in
their
practical
effects
hence
gradually
arose
the
usefulness
of
travelling
of
inspecting
the
habits
and
manners
of
a
nation
and
investigating
on
the
spot
the
causes
of
their
happiness
and
misery
finally
it
was
determined
that
spain
was
more
suitable
than
any
other
to
the
views
of
a
judicious
traveller
my
language
habits
and
religion
were
mentioned
as
obstacles
to
close
and
extensive
views
but
these
difficulties
successively
and
slowly
vanished
converse
with
books
and
natives
of
spain
a
steadfast
purpose
and
unwearied
diligence
would
efface
all
differences
between
me
and
a
castilian
with
respect
to
speech
personal
habits
were
changeable
by
the
same
means
the
bars
to
unbounded
intercourse
rising
from
the
religion
of
spain
being
irreconcilably
opposite
to
mine
cost
us
no
little
trouble
to
surmount
and
here
the
skill
of
ludloe
was
eminently
displayed
i
had
been
accustomed
to
regard
as
unquestionable
the
fallacy
of
the
romish
faith
this
persuasion
was
habitual
and
the
child
of
prejudice
and
was
easily
shaken
by
the
artifices
of
this
logician
i
was
first
led
to
bestow
a
kind
of
assent
on
the
doctrines
of
the
roman
church
but
my
convictions
were
easily
subdued
by
a
new
species
of
argumentation
and
in
a
short
time
i
reverted
to
my
ancient
disbelief
so
that
if
an
exterior
conformity
to
the
rights
of
spain
were
requisite
to
the
attainment
of
my
purpose
that
conformity
must
be
dissembled
my
moral
principles
had
hitherto
been
vague
and
unsettled
my
circumstances
had
led
me
to
the
frequent
practice
of
insincerity
but
my
transgressions
as
they
were
slight
and
transient
did
not
much
excite
my
previous
reflections
or
subsequent
remorse
my
deviations
however
though
rendered
easy
by
habit
were
by
no
means
sanctioned
by
my
principles
now
an
imposture
more
profound
and
deliberate
was
projected
and
i
could
not
hope
to
perform
well
my
part
unless
steadfastly
and
thoroughly
persuaded
of
its
rectitude
my
friend
was
the
eulogist
of
sincerity
he
delighted
to
trace
its
influence
on
the
happiness
of
mankind
and
proved
that
nothing
but
the
universal
practice
of
this
virtue
was
necessary
to
the
perfection
of
human
society
his
doctrine
was
splendid
and
beautiful
to
detect
its
imperfections
was
no
easy
task
to
lay
the
foundations
of
virtue
in
utility
and
to
limit
by
that
scale
the
operation
of
general
principles
to
see
that
the
value
of
sincerity
like
that
of
every
other
mode
of
action
consisted
in
its
tendency
to
good
and
that
therefore
the
obligation
to
speak
truth
was
not
paramount
or
intrinsical
that
my
duty
is
modelled
on
a
knowledge
and
foresight
of
the
conduct
of
others
and
that
since
men
in
their
actual
state
are
infirm
and
deceitful
a
just
estimate
of
consequences
may
sometimes
make
dissimulation
my
duty
were
truths
that
did
not
speedily
occur
the
discovery
when
made
appeared
to
be
a
joint
work
i
saw
nothing
in
ludlow
but
proofs
of
candour
and
a
judgment
incapable
of
bias
the
means
which
this
man
employed
to
fit
me
for
his
purpose
perhaps
owed
their
success
to
my
youth
and
ignorance
i
may
have
given
you
exaggerated
ideas
of
his
dexterity
and
address
of
that
i
am
unable
to
judge
certain
it
is
that
no
time
or
reflection
has
abated
my
astonishment
at
the
profoundness
of
his
schemes
and
the
perseverance
with
which
they
were
pursued
by
him
to
detail
their
progress
would
expose
me
to
the
risk
of
being
tedious
yet
none
but
minute
details
would
sufficiently
display
his
patience
and
subtlety
it
will
suffice
to
relate
that
after
a
sufficient
period
of
preparation
and
arrangements
being
made
for
maintaining
a
copious
intercourse
with
ludlow
i
embarked
for
barcelona
a
restless
curiosity
and
vigorous
application
have
distinguished
my
character
in
every
scene
here
was
spacious
field
for
the
exercise
of
all
my
energies
i
sought
out
a
preceptor
in
my
new
religion
i
entered
into
the
hearts
of
priests
and
confessors
the
and
the
peasant
the
monk
and
the
prelate
the
austere
and
voluptuous
devotee
were
scrutinized
in
all
their
forms
man
was
the
chief
subject
of
my
study
and
the
social
sphere
that
in
which
i
principally
moved
but
i
was
not
inattentive
to
inanimate
nature
nor
unmindful
of
the
past
if
the
scope
of
virtue
were
to
maintain
the
body
in
health
and
to
furnish
its
highest
enjoyments
to
every
sense
to
increase
the
number
and
accuracy
and
order
of
our
intellectual
stores
no
virtue
was
ever
more
unblemished
than
mine
if
to
act
upon
our
conceptions
of
right
and
to
acquit
ourselves
of
all
prejudice
and
selfishness
in
the
formation
of
our
principles
entitle
us
to
the
testimony
of
a
good
conscience
i
might
justly
claim
it
i
shall
not
pretend
to
ascertain
my
rank
in
the
moral
scale
your
notions
of
duty
differ
widely
from
mine
if
a
system
of
deceit
pursued
merely
from
the
love
of
truth
if
voluptuousness
never
gratified
at
the
expense
of
health
may
incur
censure
i
am
censurable
this
indeed
was
not
the
limit
of
my
deviations
deception
was
often
unnecessarily
practised
and
my
biloquial
faculty
did
not
lie
unemployed
what
has
happened
to
yourselves
may
enable
you
in
some
degree
to
judge
of
the
scenes
in
which
my
mystical
exploits
engaged
me
in
none
of
them
indeed
were
the
effects
equally
disastrous
and
they
were
for
the
most
part
the
result
of
well
digested
projects
to
recount
these
would
be
an
endless
task
they
were
designed
as
mere
specimens
of
power
to
illustrate
the
influence
of
superstition
to
give
sceptics
the
consolation
of
certainty
to
annihilate
the
scruples
of
a
tender
female
or
facilitate
my
access
to
the
bosoms
of
courtiers
and
monks
the
first
achievement
of
this
kind
took
place
in
the
convent
of
the
escurial
for
some
time
the
hospitality
of
this
brotherhood
allowed
me
a
cell
in
that
magnificent
and
gloomy
fabric
i
was
drawn
hither
chiefly
by
the
treasures
of
arabian
literature
which
are
preserved
here
in
the
keeping
of
a
learned
maronite
from
lebanon
standing
one
evening
on
the
steps
of
the
great
altar
this
devout
friar
expatiated
on
the
miraculous
evidences
of
his
religion
and
in
a
moment
of
enthusiasm
appealed
to
san
lorenzo
whose
martyrdom
was
displayed
before
us
no
sooner
was
the
appeal
made
than
the
saint
obsequious
to
the
summons
whispered
his
responses
from
the
shrine
and
commanded
the
heretic
to
tremble
and
believe
this
event
was
reported
to
the
convent
with
whatever
reluctance
i
could
not
refuse
my
testimony
to
its
truth
and
its
influence
on
my
faith
was
clearly
shewn
in
my
subsequent
conduct
a
lady
of
rank
in
seville
who
had
been
guilty
of
many
unauthorized
indulgences
was
at
last
awakened
to
remorse
by
a
voice
from
heaven
which
she
imagined
had
commanded
her
to
expiate
her
sins
by
an
abstinence
from
all
food
for
thirty
days
her
friends
found
it
impossible
to
outroot
this
persuasion
or
to
overcome
her
resolution
even
by
force
i
chanced
to
be
one
in
a
numerous
company
where
she
was
present
this
fatal
illusion
was
mentioned
and
an
opportunity
afforded
to
the
lady
of
defending
her
scheme
at
a
pause
in
the
discourse
a
voice
was
heard
from
the
ceiling
which
confirmed
the
truth
of
her
tale
but
at
the
same
time
revoked
the
command
and
in
consideration
of
her
faith
pronounced
her
absolution
satisfied
with
this
proof
the
auditors
dismissed
their
unbelief
and
the
lady
consented
to
eat
in
the
course
of
a
copious
correspondence
with
ludlow
the
observations
i
had
collected
were
given
a
sentiment
which
i
can
hardly
describe
induced
me
to
be
silent
on
all
adventures
connected
with
my
bivocal
projects
on
other
topics
i
wrote
fully
and
without
restraint
i
painted
in
vivid
hues
the
scenes
with
which
i
was
daily
conversant
and
pursued
fearlessly
every
speculation
on
religion
and
government
that
occurred
this
spirit
was
encouraged
by
ludloe
who
failed
not
to
comment
on
my
narrative
and
multiply
deductions
from
my
principles
he
taught
me
to
ascribe
the
evils
that
infest
society
to
the
errors
of
opinion
the
absurd
and
unequal
distribution
of
power
and
property
gave
birth
to
poverty
and
riches
and
these
were
the
sources
of
luxury
and
crimes
these
positions
were
readily
admitted
but
the
remedy
for
these
ills
the
means
of
rectifying
these
errors
were
not
easily
discovered
we
have
been
inclined
to
impute
them
to
inherent
defects
in
the
moral
constitution
of
men
that
oppression
and
tyranny
grow
up
by
a
sort
of
natural
necessity
and
that
they
will
perish
only
when
the
human
species
is
extinct
ludloe
laboured
to
prove
that
this
was
by
no
means
the
case
that
man
is
the
creature
of
circumstances
that
he
is
capable
of
endless
improvement
that
his
progress
has
been
stopped
by
the
artificial
impediment
of
government
that
by
the
removal
of
this
the
fondest
dreams
of
imagination
will
be
realized
from
detailing
and
accounting
for
the
evils
which
exist
under
our
present
institutions
he
usually
proceeded
to
delineate
some
scheme
of
utopian
felicity
where
the
empire
of
reason
should
supplant
that
of
force
where
justice
should
be
universally
understood
and
practised
where
the
interest
of
the
whole
and
of
the
individual
should
be
seen
by
all
to
be
the
same
where
the
public
good
should
be
the
scope
of
all
activity
where
the
tasks
of
all
should
be
the
same
and
the
means
of
subsistence
equally
distributed
no
one
could
contemplate
his
pictures
without
rapture
by
their
comprehensiveness
and
amplitude
they
filled
the
imagination
i
was
unwilling
to
believe
that
in
no
region
of
the
world
or
at
no
period
could
these
ideas
be
realized
it
was
plain
that
the
nations
of
europe
were
tending
to
greater
depravity
and
would
be
the
prey
of
perpetual
vicissitude
all
individual
attempts
at
their
reformation
would
be
fruitless
he
therefore
who
desired
the
diffusion
of
right
principles
to
make
a
just
system
be
adopted
by
a
whole
community
must
pursue
some
extraordinary
method
in
this
state
of
mind
i
recollected
my
native
country
where
a
few
colonists
from
britain
had
sown
the
germe
of
populous
and
mighty
empires
attended
as
they
were
into
their
new
abode
by
all
their
prejudices
yet
such
had
been
the
influence
of
new
circumstances
of
consulting
for
their
own
happiness
of
adopting
simple
forms
of
government
and
excluding
nobles
and
kings
from
their
system
that
they
enjoyed
a
degree
of
happiness
far
superior
to
their
parent
state
to
conquer
the
prejudices
and
change
the
habits
of
millions
are
impossible
the
human
mind
exposed
to
social
influences
inflexibly
adheres
to
the
direction
that
is
given
to
it
but
for
the
same
reason
why
men
who
begin
in
error
will
continue
those
who
commence
in
truth
may
be
expected
to
persist
habit
and
example
will
operate
with
equal
force
in
both
instances
let
a
few
sufficiently
enlightened
and
disinterested
take
up
their
abode
in
some
unvisited
region
let
their
social
scheme
be
founded
in
equity
and
how
small
soever
their
original
number
may
be
their
growth
into
a
nation
is
inevitable
among
other
effects
of
national
justice
was
to
be
ranked
the
swift
increase
of
numbers
exempt
from
servile
obligations
and
perverse
habits
endowed
with
property
wisdom
and
health
hundreds
will
expand
with
inconceivable
rapidity
into
thousands
and
thousands
into
millions
and
a
new
race
tutored
in
truth
may
in
a
few
centuries
overflow
the
habitable
world
such
were
the
visions
of
youth
i
could
not
banish
them
from
my
mind
i
knew
them
to
be
crude
but
believed
that
deliberation
would
bestow
upon
them
solidity
and
shape
meanwhile
i
imparted
them
to
ludloe
chapter
vi
in
answer
to
the
reveries
and
speculations
which
i
sent
to
him
respecting
this
subject
ludloe
informed
me
that
they
had
led
his
mind
into
a
new
sphere
of
meditation
he
had
long
and
deeply
considered
in
what
way
he
might
essentially
promote
my
happiness
he
had
entertained
a
faint
hope
that
i
would
one
day
be
qualified
for
a
station
like
that
to
which
he
himself
had
been
advanced
this
post
required
an
elevation
and
stability
of
views
which
human
beings
seldom
reach
and
which
could
be
attained
by
me
only
by
a
long
series
of
heroic
labours
hitherto
every
new
stage
in
my
intellectual
progress
had
added
vigour
to
his
hopes
and
he
cherished
a
stronger
belief
than
formerly
that
my
career
would
terminate
auspiciously
this
however
was
necessarily
distant
many
preliminaries
must
first
be
settled
many
arduous
accomplishments
be
first
obtained
and
my
virtue
be
subjected
to
severe
trials
at
present
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
be
more
explicit
but
if
my
reflections
suggested
no
better
plan
he
advised
me
to
settle
my
affairs
in
spain
and
return
to
him
immediately
my
knowledge
of
this
country
would
be
of
the
highest
use
on
the
supposition
of
my
ultimately
arriving
at
the
honours
to
which
he
had
alluded
and
some
of
these
preparatory
measures
could
be
taken
only
with
his
assistance
and
in
his
company
this
intimation
was
eagerly
obeyed
and
in
a
short
time
i
arrived
at
dublin
meanwhile
my
mind
had
copious
occupation
in
commenting
on
my
friend
letter
this
scheme
whatever
it
was
seemed
to
be
suggested
by
my
mention
of
a
plan
of
colonization
and
my
preference
of
that
mode
of
producing
extensive
and
permanent
effects
on
the
condition
of
mankind
it
was
easy
therefore
to
conjecture
that
this
mode
had
been
pursued
under
some
mysterious
modifications
and
conditions
it
had
always
excited
my
wonder
that
so
obvious
an
expedient
had
been
overlooked
the
globe
which
we
inhabit
was
very
imperfectly
known
the
regions
and
nations
unexplored
it
was
reasonable
to
believe
surpassed
in
extent
and
perhaps
in
populousness
those
with
which
we
were
familiar
the
order
of
jesuits
had
furnished
an
example
of
all
the
errors
and
excellencies
of
such
a
scheme
their
plan
was
founded
on
erroneous
notions
of
religion
and
policy
and
they
had
absurdly
chosen
a
scene
within
reach
of
the
injustice
and
ambition
of
an
european
tyrant
it
was
wise
and
easy
to
profit
by
their
example
resting
on
the
two
props
of
fidelity
and
zeal
an
association
might
exist
for
ages
in
the
heart
of
europe
whose
influence
might
be
felt
and
might
be
boundless
in
some
region
of
the
southern
hemisphere
and
by
whom
a
moral
and
political
structure
might
be
raised
the
growth
of
pure
wisdom
and
totally
unlike
those
fragments
of
roman
and
gothic
barbarism
which
cover
the
face
of
what
are
called
the
civilized
nations
the
belief
now
rose
in
my
mind
that
some
such
scheme
had
actually
been
prosecuted
and
that
ludloe
was
a
coadjutor
on
this
supposition
the
caution
with
which
he
approached
to
his
point
the
arduous
probation
which
a
candidate
for
a
part
on
this
stage
must
undergo
and
the
rigours
of
that
test
by
which
his
fortitude
and
virtue
must
be
tried
were
easily
explained
i
was
too
deeply
imbued
with
veneration
for
the
effects
of
such
schemes
and
too
sanguine
in
my
confidence
in
the
rectitude
of
ludloe
to
refuse
my
concurrence
in
any
scheme
by
which
my
qualifications
might
at
length
be
raised
to
a
due
point
our
interview
was
frank
and
affectionate
i
found
him
situated
just
as
formerly
his
aspect
manners
and
deportment
were
the
same
i
entered
once
more
on
my
former
mode
of
life
but
our
intercourse
became
more
frequent
we
constantly
breakfasted
together
and
our
conversation
was
usually
prolonged
through
half
the
morning
for
a
time
our
topics
were
general
i
thought
proper
to
leave
to
him
the
introduction
of
more
interesting
themes
this
however
he
betrayed
no
inclination
to
do
his
reserve
excited
some
surprise
and
i
began
to
suspect
that
whatever
design
he
had
formed
with
regard
to
me
had
been
laid
aside
to
ascertain
this
question
i
ventured
at
length
to
recall
his
attention
to
the
subject
of
his
last
letter
and
to
enquire
whether
subsequent
reflection
had
made
any
change
in
his
views
he
said
that
his
views
were
too
momentous
to
be
hastily
taken
up
or
hastily
dismissed
the
station
my
attainment
of
which
depended
wholly
on
myself
was
high
above
vulgar
heads
and
was
to
be
gained
by
years
of
solicitude
and
labour
this
at
least
was
true
with
regard
to
minds
ordinarily
constituted
i
perhaps
deserved
to
be
regarded
as
an
exception
and
might
be
able
to
accomplish
in
a
few
months
that
for
which
others
were
obliged
to
toil
during
half
their
lives
man
continued
he
is
the
slave
of
habit
convince
him
that
his
duty
leads
straight
forward
he
shall
advance
but
at
every
step
his
belief
shall
fade
habit
will
resume
its
empire
and
tomorrow
he
shall
turn
back
or
betake
himself
to
oblique
paths
we
know
not
our
strength
till
it
be
tried
virtue
till
confirmed
by
habit
is
a
dream
you
are
a
man
imbued
by
errors
and
vincible
by
slight
temptations
deep
enquiries
must
bestow
light
on
your
opinions
and
the
habit
of
encountering
and
vanquishing
temptation
must
inspire
you
with
fortitude
till
this
be
done
you
are
unqualified
for
that
post
in
which
you
will
be
invested
with
divine
attributes
and
prescribe
the
condition
of
a
large
portion
of
mankind
confide
not
in
the
firmness
of
your
principles
or
the
stedfastness
of
your
integrity
be
always
vigilant
and
fearful
never
think
you
have
enough
of
knowledge
and
let
not
your
caution
slumber
for
a
moment
for
you
know
not
when
danger
is
near
i
acknowledged
the
justice
of
his
admonitions
and
professed
myself
willing
to
undergo
any
ordeal
which
reason
should
prescribe
what
i
asked
were
the
conditions
on
the
fulfilment
of
which
depended
my
advancement
to
the
station
he
alluded
to
was
it
necessary
to
conceal
from
me
the
nature
and
obligations
of
this
rank
these
enquiries
sunk
him
more
profoundly
into
meditation
than
i
had
ever
before
witnessed
after
a
pause
in
which
some
perplexity
was
visible
he
answered
i
scarcely
know
what
to
say
as
to
promises
i
claim
them
not
from
you
we
are
now
arrived
at
a
point
in
which
it
is
necessary
to
look
around
with
caution
and
that
consequences
should
be
fully
known
a
number
of
persons
are
leagued
together
for
an
end
of
some
moment
to
make
yourself
one
of
these
is
submitted
to
your
choice
among
the
conditions
of
their
alliance
are
mutual
fidelity
and
secrecy
their
existence
depends
upon
this
their
existence
is
known
only
to
themselves
this
secrecy
must
be
obtained
by
all
the
means
which
are
possible
when
i
have
said
thus
much
i
have
informed
you
in
some
degree
of
their
existence
but
you
are
still
ignorant
of
the
purpose
contemplated
by
this
association
and
of
all
the
members
except
myself
so
far
no
dangerous
disclosure
is
yet
made
but
this
degree
of
concealment
is
not
sufficient
thus
much
is
made
known
to
you
because
it
is
unavoidable
the
individuals
which
compose
this
fraternity
are
not
immortal
and
the
vacancies
occasioned
by
death
must
be
supplied
from
among
the
living
the
candidate
must
be
instructed
and
prepared
and
they
are
always
at
liberty
to
recede
their
reason
must
approve
the
obligations
and
duties
of
their
station
or
they
are
unfit
for
it
if
they
recede
one
duty
is
still
incumbent
upon
them
they
must
observe
an
inviolable
silence
to
this
they
are
not
held
by
any
promise
they
must
weigh
consequences
and
freely
decide
but
they
must
not
fail
to
number
among
these
consequences
their
own
death
their
death
will
not
be
prompted
by
vengeance
the
executioner
will
say
he
that
has
once
revealed
the
tale
is
likely
to
reveal
it
a
second
time
and
to
prevent
this
the
betrayer
must
die
nor
is
this
the
only
consequence
to
prevent
the
further
revelation
he
to
whom
the
secret
was
imparted
must
likewise
perish
he
must
not
console
himself
with
the
belief
that
his
trespass
will
be
unknown
the
knowledge
can
not
by
human
means
be
withheld
from
this
fraternity
rare
indeed
will
it
be
that
his
purpose
to
disclose
is
not
discovered
before
it
can
be
effected
and
the
disclosure
prevented
by
his
death
be
well
aware
of
your
condition
what
i
now
or
may
hereafter
mention
mention
not
again
admit
not
even
a
doubt
as
to
the
propriety
of
hiding
it
from
all
the
world
there
are
eyes
who
will
discern
this
doubt
amidst
the
closest
folds
of
your
heart
and
your
life
will
instantly
be
sacrificed
at
present
be
the
subject
dismissed
reflect
deeply
on
the
duty
which
you
have
already
incurred
think
upon
your
strength
of
mind
and
be
careful
not
to
lay
yourself
under
impracticable
obligations
it
will
always
be
in
your
power
to
recede
even
after
you
are
solemnly
enrolled
a
member
you
may
consult
the
dictates
of
your
own
understanding
and
relinquish
your
post
but
while
you
live
the
obligation
to
be
silent
will
perpetually
attend
you
we
seek
not
the
misery
or
death
of
any
one
but
we
are
swayed
by
an
immutable
calculation
death
is
to
be
abhorred
but
the
life
of
the
betrayer
is
productive
of
more
evil
than
his
death
his
death
therefore
we
chuse
and
our
means
are
instantaneous
and
unerring
i
love
you
the
first
impulse
of
my
love
is
to
dissuade
you
from
seeking
to
know
more
your
mind
will
be
full
of
ideas
your
hands
will
be
perpetually
busy
to
a
purpose
into
which
no
human
creature
beyond
the
verge
of
your
brotherhood
must
pry
believe
me
who
have
made
the
experiment
that
compared
with
this
task
the
task
of
inviolable
secrecy
all
others
are
easy
to
be
dumb
will
not
suffice
never
to
know
any
remission
in
your
zeal
or
your
watchfulness
will
not
suffice
if
the
sagacity
of
others
detect
your
occupations
however
strenuously
you
may
labour
for
concealment
your
doom
is
ratified
as
well
as
that
of
the
wretch
whose
evil
destiny
led
him
to
pursue
you
yet
if
your
fidelity
fail
not
great
will
be
your
recompence
for
all
your
toils
and
ample
will
be
the
retribution
hitherto
you
have
been
wrapt
in
darkness
and
storm
then
will
you
be
exalted
to
a
pure
and
unruffled
element
it
is
only
for
a
time
that
temptation
will
environ
you
and
your
path
will
be
toilsome
in
a
few
years
you
will
be
permitted
to
withdraw
to
a
land
of
sages
and
the
remainder
of
your
life
will
glide
away
in
the
enjoyments
of
beneficence
and
wisdom
think
deeply
on
what
i
have
said
investigate
your
own
motives
and
opinions
and
prepare
to
submit
them
to
the
test
of
numerous
hazards
and
experiments
here
my
friend
passed
to
a
new
topic
i
was
desirous
of
reverting
to
this
subject
and
obtaining
further
information
concerning
it
but
he
assiduously
repelled
all
my
attempts
and
insisted
on
my
bestowing
deep
and
impartial
attention
on
what
had
already
been
disclosed
i
was
not
slow
to
comply
with
his
directions
my
mind
refused
to
admit
any
other
theme
of
contemplation
than
this
as
yet
i
had
no
glimpse
of
the
nature
of
this
fraternity
i
was
permitted
to
form
conjectures
and
previous
incidents
bestowed
but
one
form
upon
my
thoughts
in
reviewing
the
sentiments
and
deportment
of
ludloe
my
belief
continually
acquired
new
strength
i
even
recollected
hints
and
ambiguous
allusions
in
his
discourse
which
were
easily
solved
on
the
supposition
of
the
existence
of
a
new
model
of
society
in
some
unsuspected
corner
of
the
world
i
did
not
fully
perceive
the
necessity
of
secrecy
but
this
necessity
perhaps
would
be
rendered
apparent
when
i
should
come
to
know
the
connection
that
subsisted
between
europe
and
this
imaginary
colony
but
what
was
to
be
done
i
was
willing
to
abide
by
these
conditions
my
understanding
might
not
approve
of
all
the
ends
proposed
by
this
fraternity
and
i
had
liberty
to
withdraw
from
it
or
to
refuse
to
ally
myself
with
them
that
the
obligation
of
secrecy
should
still
remain
was
unquestionably
reasonable
it
appeared
to
be
the
plan
of
ludloe
rather
to
damp
than
to
stimulate
my
zeal
he
discouraged
all
attempts
to
renew
the
subject
in
conversation
he
dwelt
upon
the
arduousness
of
the
office
to
which
i
aspired
the
temptations
to
violate
my
duty
with
which
i
should
be
continually
beset
the
inevitable
death
with
which
the
slightest
breach
of
my
engagements
would
be
followed
and
the
long
apprenticeship
which
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
serve
before
i
should
be
fitted
to
enter
into
this
conclave
sometimes
my
courage
was
depressed
by
these
representations
my
zeal
however
was
sure
to
revive
and
at
length
ludloe
declared
himself
willing
to
assist
me
in
the
accomplishment
of
my
wishes
for
this
end
it
was
necessary
he
said
that
i
should
be
informed
of
a
second
obligation
which
every
candidate
must
assume
before
any
one
could
be
deemed
qualified
he
must
be
thoroughly
known
to
his
associates
for
this
end
he
must
determine
to
disclose
every
fact
in
his
history
and
every
secret
of
his
heart
i
must
begin
with
making
these
confessions
with
regard
to
my
past
life
to
ludloe
and
must
continue
to
communicate
at
stated
seasons
every
new
thought
and
every
new
occurrence
to
him
this
confidence
was
to
be
absolutely
limitless
no
exceptions
were
to
be
admitted
and
no
reserves
to
be
practised
and
the
same
penalty
attended
the
infraction
of
this
rule
as
of
the
former
means
would
be
employed
by
which
the
slightest
deviation
in
either
case
would
be
detected
and
the
deathful
consequence
would
follow
with
instant
and
inevitable
expedition
if
secrecy
were
difficult
to
practise
sincerity
in
that
degree
in
which
it
was
here
demanded
was
a
task
infinitely
more
arduous
and
a
period
of
new
deliberation
was
necessary
before
i
should
decide
i
was
at
liberty
to
pause
nay
the
longer
was
the
period
of
deliberation
which
i
took
the
better
but
when
i
had
once
entered
this
path
it
was
not
in
my
power
to
recede
after
having
solemnly
avowed
my
resolution
to
be
thus
sincere
in
my
confession
any
particle
of
reserve
or
duplicity
would
cost
me
my
life
this
indeed
was
a
subject
to
be
deeply
thought
upon
hitherto
i
had
been
guilty
of
concealment
with
regard
to
my
friend
i
had
entered
into
no
formal
compact
but
had
been
conscious
to
a
kind
of
tacit
obligation
to
hide
no
important
transaction
of
my
life
from
him
this
consciousness
was
the
source
of
continual
anxiety
i
had
exerted
on
numerous
occasions
my
bivocal
faculty
but
in
my
intercourse
with
ludloe
had
suffered
not
the
slightest
intimation
to
escape
me
with
regard
to
it
this
reserve
was
not
easily
explained
it
was
in
a
great
degree
the
product
of
habit
but
i
likewise
considered
that
the
efficacy
of
this
instrument
depended
upon
its
existence
being
unknown
to
confide
the
secret
to
one
was
to
put
an
end
to
my
privilege
how
widely
the
knowledge
would
thenceforth
be
diffused
i
had
no
power
to
foresee
each
day
multiplied
the
impediments
to
confidence
shame
hindered
me
from
acknowledging
my
past
reserves
ludloe
from
the
nature
of
our
intercourse
would
certainly
account
my
reserve
in
this
respect
unjustifiable
and
to
excite
his
indignation
or
contempt
was
an
unpleasing
undertaking
now
if
i
should
resolve
to
persist
in
my
new
path
this
reserve
must
be
dismissed
i
must
make
him
master
of
a
secret
which
was
precious
to
me
beyond
all
others
by
acquainting
him
with
past
concealments
i
must
risk
incurring
his
suspicion
and
his
anger
these
reflections
were
productive
of
considerable
embarrassment
there
was
indeed
an
avenue
by
which
to
escape
these
difficulties
if
it
did
not
at
the
same
time
plunge
me
into
greater
my
confessions
might
in
other
respects
be
unbounded
but
my
reserves
in
this
particular
might
be
continued
yet
should
i
not
expose
myself
to
formidable
perils
would
my
secret
be
for
ever
unsuspected
and
undiscovered
when
i
considered
the
nature
of
this
faculty
the
impossibility
of
going
farther
than
suspicion
since
the
agent
could
be
known
only
by
his
own
confession
and
even
this
confession
would
not
be
believed
by
the
greater
part
of
mankind
i
was
tempted
to
conceal
it
in
most
cases
if
i
had
asserted
the
possession
of
this
power
i
should
be
treated
as
a
liar
it
would
be
considered
as
an
absurd
and
audacious
expedient
to
free
myself
from
the
suspicion
of
having
entered
into
compact
with
a
daemon
or
of
being
myself
an
emissary
of
the
grand
foe
here
however
there
was
no
reason
to
dread
a
similar
imputation
since
ludloe
had
denied
the
preternatural
pretensions
of
these
airy
sounds
my
conduct
on
this
occasion
was
nowise
influenced
by
the
belief
of
any
inherent
sanctity
in
truth
ludloe
had
taught
me
to
model
myself
in
this
respect
entirely
with
a
view
to
immediate
consequences
if
my
genuine
interest
on
the
whole
was
promoted
by
veracity
it
was
proper
to
adhere
to
it
but
if
the
result
of
my
investigation
were
opposite
truth
was
to
be
sacrificed
without
scruple
paraguay
chapter
vii
meanwhile
in
a
point
of
so
much
moment
i
was
not
hasty
to
determine
my
delay
seemed
to
be
by
no
means
unacceptable
to
ludloe
who
applauded
my
discretion
and
warned
me
to
be
circumspect
my
attention
was
chiefly
absorbed
by
considerations
connected
with
this
subject
and
little
regard
was
paid
to
any
foreign
occupation
or
amusement
one
evening
after
a
day
spent
in
my
closet
i
sought
recreation
by
walking
forth
my
mind
was
chiefly
occupied
by
the
review
of
incidents
which
happened
in
spain
i
turned
my
face
towards
the
fields
and
recovered
not
from
my
reverie
till
i
had
proceeded
some
miles
on
the
road
to
meath
the
night
had
considerably
advanced
and
the
darkness
was
rendered
intense
by
the
setting
of
the
moon
being
somewhat
weary
as
well
as
undetermined
in
what
manner
next
to
proceed
i
seated
myself
on
a
grassy
bank
beside
the
road
the
spot
which
i
had
chosen
was
aloof
from
passengers
and
shrowded
in
the
deepest
obscurity
some
time
elapsed
when
my
attention
was
excited
by
the
slow
approach
of
an
equipage
i
presently
discovered
a
coach
and
six
horses
but
unattended
except
by
coachman
and
postillion
and
with
no
light
to
guide
them
on
their
way
scarcely
had
they
passed
the
spot
where
i
rested
when
some
one
leaped
from
beneath
the
hedge
and
seized
the
head
of
the
another
called
upon
the
coachman
to
stop
and
threatened
him
with
instant
death
if
he
disobeyed
a
third
drew
open
the
and
ordered
those
within
to
deliver
their
purses
a
shriek
of
terror
showed
me
that
a
lady
was
within
who
eagerly
consented
to
preserve
her
life
by
the
loss
of
her
money
to
walk
unarmed
in
the
neighbourhood
of
dublin
especially
at
night
has
always
been
accounted
dangerous
i
had
about
me
the
usual
instruments
of
defence
i
was
desirous
of
rescuing
this
person
from
the
danger
which
surrounded
her
but
was
somewhat
at
a
loss
how
to
effect
my
purpose
my
single
strength
was
insufficient
to
contend
with
three
ruffians
after
a
moment
debate
an
expedient
was
suggested
which
i
hastened
to
execute
time
had
not
been
allowed
for
the
ruffian
who
stood
beside
the
carriage
to
receive
the
plunder
when
several
voices
loud
clamorous
and
eager
were
heard
in
the
quarter
whence
the
traveller
had
come
by
trampling
with
quickness
it
was
easy
to
imitate
the
sound
of
many
feet
the
robbers
were
alarmed
and
one
called
upon
another
to
attend
the
sounds
increased
and
at
the
next
moment
they
betook
themselves
to
flight
but
not
till
a
pistol
was
discharged
whether
it
was
aimed
at
the
lady
in
the
carriage
or
at
the
coachman
i
was
not
permitted
to
discover
for
the
report
affrighted
the
horses
and
they
set
off
at
full
speed
i
could
not
hope
to
overtake
them
i
knew
not
whither
the
robbers
had
fled
and
whether
by
proceeding
i
might
not
fall
into
their
hands
these
considerations
induced
me
to
resume
my
feet
and
retire
from
the
scene
as
expeditiously
as
possible
i
regained
my
own
habitation
without
injury
i
have
said
that
i
occupied
separate
apartments
from
those
of
ludloe
to
these
there
were
means
of
access
without
disturbing
the
family
i
hasted
to
my
chamber
but
was
considerably
surprized
to
find
on
entering
my
apartment
ludloe
seated
at
a
table
with
a
lamp
before
him
my
momentary
confusion
was
greater
than
his
on
discovering
who
it
was
he
assumed
his
accustomed
looks
and
explained
appearances
by
saying
that
he
wished
to
converse
with
me
on
a
subject
of
importance
and
had
therefore
sought
me
at
this
secret
hour
in
my
own
chamber
contrary
to
his
expectation
i
was
absent
conceiving
it
possible
that
i
might
shortly
return
he
had
waited
till
now
he
took
no
further
notice
of
my
absence
nor
manifested
any
desire
to
know
the
cause
of
it
but
proceeded
to
mention
the
subject
which
had
brought
him
hither
these
were
his
words
you
have
nothing
which
the
laws
permit
you
to
call
your
own
justice
entitles
you
to
the
supply
of
your
physical
wants
from
those
who
are
able
to
supply
them
but
there
are
few
who
will
acknowledge
your
claim
or
spare
an
atom
of
their
superfluity
to
appease
your
cravings
that
which
they
will
not
spontaneously
give
it
is
not
right
to
wrest
from
them
by
violence
what
then
is
to
be
done
property
is
necessary
to
your
own
subsistence
it
is
useful
by
enabling
you
to
supply
the
wants
of
others
to
give
food
and
clothing
and
shelter
is
to
give
life
to
annihilate
temptation
to
unshackle
virtue
and
propagate
felicity
how
shall
property
be
gained
you
may
set
your
understanding
or
your
hands
at
work
you
may
weave
stockings
or
write
poems
and
exchange
them
for
money
but
these
are
tardy
and
meagre
schemes
the
means
are
disproportioned
to
the
end
and
i
will
not
suffer
you
to
pursue
them
my
justice
will
supply
your
wants
but
dependance
on
the
justice
of
others
is
a
precarious
condition
to
be
the
object
is
a
less
ennobling
state
than
to
be
the
bestower
of
benefit
doubtless
you
desire
to
be
vested
with
competence
and
riches
and
to
hold
them
by
virtue
of
the
law
and
not
at
the
will
of
a
benefactor
he
paused
as
if
waiting
for
my
assent
to
his
positions
i
readily
expressed
my
concurrence
and
my
desire
to
pursue
any
means
compatible
with
honesty
he
resumed
there
are
various
means
besides
labour
violence
or
fraud
it
is
right
to
select
the
easiest
within
your
reach
it
happens
that
the
easiest
is
at
hand
a
revenue
of
some
thousands
a
year
a
stately
mansion
in
the
city
and
another
in
kildare
old
and
faithful
domestics
and
magnificent
furniture
are
good
things
will
you
have
them
a
gift
like
that
replied
i
will
be
attended
by
momentous
conditions
i
can
not
decide
upon
its
value
until
i
know
these
conditions
the
sole
condition
is
your
consent
to
receive
them
not
even
the
airy
obligation
of
gratitude
will
be
created
by
acceptance
on
the
contrary
by
accepting
them
you
will
confer
the
highest
benefit
upon
another
i
do
not
comprehend
you
something
surely
must
be
given
in
return
nothing
it
may
seem
strange
that
in
accepting
the
absolute
controul
of
so
much
property
you
subject
yourself
to
no
conditions
that
no
claims
of
gratitude
or
service
will
accrue
but
the
wonder
is
greater
still
the
law
equitably
enough
fetters
the
gift
with
no
restraints
with
respect
to
you
that
receive
it
but
not
so
with
regard
to
the
unhappy
being
who
bestows
it
that
being
must
part
not
only
with
property
but
liberty
in
accepting
the
property
you
must
consent
to
enjoy
the
services
of
the
present
possessor
they
can
not
be
disjoined
of
the
true
nature
and
extent
of
the
gift
you
should
be
fully
apprized
be
aware
therefore
that
together
with
this
property
you
will
receive
absolute
power
over
the
liberty
and
person
of
the
being
who
now
possesses
it
that
being
must
become
your
domestic
slave
be
governed
in
every
particular
by
your
caprice
happily
for
you
though
fully
invested
with
this
power
the
degree
and
mode
in
which
it
will
be
exercised
will
depend
upon
yourself
you
may
either
totally
forbear
the
exercise
or
employ
it
only
for
the
benefit
of
your
slave
however
injurious
therefore
this
authority
may
be
to
the
subject
of
it
it
will
in
some
sense
only
enhance
the
value
of
the
gift
to
you
the
attachment
and
obedience
of
this
being
will
be
chiefly
evident
in
one
thing
its
duty
will
consist
in
conforming
in
every
instance
to
your
will
all
the
powers
of
this
being
are
to
be
devoted
to
your
happiness
but
there
is
one
relation
between
you
which
enables
you
to
confer
while
exacting
pleasure
this
relation
is
your
slave
is
a
woman
and
the
bond
which
transfers
her
property
and
person
to
you
is
my
knowledge
of
ludloe
his
principles
and
reasonings
ought
to
have
precluded
that
surprise
which
i
experienced
at
the
conclusion
of
his
discourse
i
knew
that
he
regarded
the
present
institution
of
marriage
as
a
contract
of
servitude
and
the
terms
of
it
unequal
and
unjust
when
my
surprise
had
subsided
my
thoughts
turned
upon
the
nature
of
his
scheme
after
a
pause
of
reflection
i
answered
both
law
and
custom
have
connected
obligations
with
marriage
which
though
heaviest
on
the
female
are
not
light
upon
the
male
their
weight
and
extent
are
not
immutable
and
uniform
they
are
modified
by
various
incidents
and
especially
by
the
mental
and
personal
qualities
of
the
lady
i
am
not
sure
that
i
should
willingly
accept
the
property
and
person
of
a
woman
decrepid
with
age
and
enslaved
by
perverse
habits
and
evil
passions
whereas
youth
beauty
and
tenderness
would
be
worth
accepting
even
for
their
own
sake
and
disconnected
with
fortune
as
to
altar
vows
i
believe
they
will
not
make
me
swerve
from
equity
i
shall
exact
neither
service
nor
affection
from
my
spouse
the
value
of
these
and
indeed
not
only
the
value
but
the
very
existence
of
the
latter
depends
upon
its
spontaneity
a
promise
to
love
tends
rather
to
loosen
than
strengthen
the
tie
as
to
myself
the
age
of
illusion
is
past
i
shall
not
wed
till
i
find
one
whose
moral
and
physical
constitution
will
make
personal
fidelity
easy
i
shall
judge
without
mistiness
or
passion
and
habit
will
come
in
aid
of
an
enlightened
and
deliberate
choice
i
shall
not
be
fastidious
in
my
choice
i
do
not
expect
and
scarcely
desire
much
intellectual
similitude
between
me
and
my
wife
our
opinions
and
pursuits
can
not
be
in
common
while
women
are
formed
by
their
education
and
their
education
continues
in
its
present
state
tender
hearts
and
misguided
understandings
are
all
that
we
can
hope
to
meet
with
what
are
the
character
age
and
person
of
the
woman
to
whom
you
allude
and
what
prospect
of
success
would
attend
my
exertions
to
obtain
her
favour
i
have
told
you
she
is
rich
she
is
a
widow
and
owes
her
riches
to
the
liberality
of
her
husband
who
was
a
trader
of
great
opulence
and
who
died
while
on
a
mercantile
adventure
to
spain
he
was
not
unknown
to
you
your
letters
from
spain
often
spoke
of
him
in
short
she
is
the
widow
of
benington
whom
you
met
at
barcelona
she
is
still
in
the
prime
of
life
is
not
without
many
feminine
attractions
has
an
ardent
and
credulent
temper
and
is
particularly
given
to
devotion
this
temper
it
would
be
easy
to
regulate
according
to
your
pleasure
and
your
interest
and
i
now
submit
to
you
the
expediency
of
an
alliance
with
her
i
am
a
kinsman
and
regarded
by
her
with
uncommon
deference
and
my
commendations
therefore
will
be
of
great
service
to
you
and
shall
be
given
i
will
deal
ingenuously
with
you
it
is
proper
you
should
be
fully
acquainted
with
the
grounds
of
this
proposal
the
benefits
of
rank
and
property
and
independence
which
i
have
already
mentioned
as
likely
to
accrue
to
you
from
this
marriage
are
solid
and
valuable
benefits
but
these
are
not
the
sole
advantages
and
to
benefit
you
in
these
respects
is
not
my
whole
view
no
my
treatment
of
you
henceforth
will
be
regulated
by
one
principle
i
regard
you
only
as
one
undergoing
a
probation
or
apprenticeship
as
subjected
to
trials
of
your
sincerity
and
fortitude
the
marriage
i
now
propose
to
you
is
desirable
because
it
will
make
you
independent
of
me
your
poverty
might
create
an
unsuitable
bias
in
favour
of
proposals
one
of
whose
effects
would
be
to
set
you
beyond
fortune
reach
that
bias
will
cease
when
you
cease
to
be
poor
and
dependent
love
is
the
strongest
of
all
human
delusions
that
fortitude
which
is
not
subdued
by
the
tenderness
and
blandishments
of
woman
may
be
trusted
but
no
fortitude
which
has
not
undergone
that
test
will
be
trusted
by
us
this
woman
is
a
charming
enthusiast
she
will
never
marry
but
him
whom
she
passionately
loves
her
power
over
the
heart
that
loves
her
will
scarcely
have
limits
the
means
of
prying
into
your
transactions
of
suspecting
and
sifting
your
thoughts
which
her
constant
society
with
you
while
sleeping
and
waking
her
zeal
and
watchfulness
for
your
welfare
and
her
curiosity
adroitness
and
penetration
will
afford
her
are
evident
your
danger
therefore
will
be
imminent
your
fortitude
will
be
obliged
to
have
recourse
not
to
flight
but
to
vigilance
your
eye
must
never
close
alas
what
human
magnanimity
can
stand
this
test
how
can
i
persuade
myself
that
you
will
not
fail
i
waver
between
hope
and
fear
many
it
is
true
have
fallen
and
dragged
with
them
the
author
of
their
ruin
but
some
have
soared
above
even
these
perils
and
temptations
with
their
fiery
energies
unimpaired
and
great
has
been
as
great
ought
to
be
their
recompence
but
you
are
doubtless
aware
of
your
danger
i
need
not
repeat
the
consequences
of
betraying
your
trust
the
rigour
of
those
who
will
judge
your
fault
the
unerring
and
unbounded
scrutiny
to
which
your
actions
the
most
secret
and
indifferent
will
be
subjected
your
conduct
however
will
be
voluntary
at
your
own
option
be
it
to
see
or
not
to
see
this
woman
circumspection
deliberation
forethought
are
your
sacred
duties

remarks
on
the
seductive
and
bewitching
powers
of
women
on
the
difficulty
of
keeping
a
secret
which
they
wish
to
know
and
to
gain
which
they
employ
the
soft
artillery
of
tears
and
prayers
and
blandishments
and
menaces
are
familiar
to
all
men
but
they
had
little
weight
with
me
because
they
were
unsupported
by
my
own
experience
i
had
never
had
any
intellectual
or
sentimental
connection
with
the
sex
my
meditations
and
pursuits
had
all
led
a
different
way
and
a
bias
had
gradually
been
given
to
my
feelings
very
unfavourable
to
the
refinements
of
love
i
acknowledge
with
shame
and
regret
that
i
was
accustomed
to
regard
the
physical
and
sensual
consequences
of
the
sexual
relation
as
realities
and
every
thing
intellectual
disinterested
and
heroic
which
enthusiasts
connect
with
it
as
idle
dreams
besides
said
i
i
am
yet
a
stranger
to
the
secret
on
the
preservation
of
which
so
much
stress
is
laid
and
it
will
be
optional
with
me
to
receive
it
or
not
if
in
the
progress
of
my
acquaintance
with
benington
i
should
perceive
any
extraordinary
danger
in
the
gift
can
not
i
refuse
or
at
least
delay
to
comply
with
any
new
conditions
from
ludloe
will
not
his
candour
and
his
affection
for
me
rather
commend
than
disapprove
my
diffidence
in
fine
i
resolved
to
see
this
lady
she
was
it
seems
the
widow
of
benington
whom
i
knew
in
spain
this
man
was
an
english
merchant
settled
at
barcelona
to
whom
i
had
been
commended
by
ludloe
letters
and
through
whom
my
pecuniary
supplies
were
furnished
much
intercourse
and
some
degree
of
intimacy
had
taken
place
between
us
and
i
had
gained
a
pretty
accurate
knowledge
of
his
character
i
had
been
informed
through
different
channels
that
his
wife
was
much
his
superior
in
rank
that
she
possessed
great
wealth
in
her
own
right
and
that
some
disagreement
of
temper
or
views
occasioned
their
separation
she
had
married
him
for
love
and
still
doated
on
him
the
occasions
for
separation
having
arisen
it
seems
not
on
her
side
but
on
his
as
his
habits
of
reflection
were
nowise
friendly
to
religion
and
as
hers
according
to
ludloe
were
of
the
opposite
kind
it
is
possible
that
some
jarring
had
arisen
between
them
from
this
source
indeed
from
some
casual
and
broken
hints
of
benington
especially
in
the
latter
part
of
his
life
i
had
long
since
gathered
this
conjecture
something
thought
i
may
be
derived
from
my
acquaintance
with
her
husband
favourable
to
my
views
i
anxiously
waited
for
an
opportunity
of
acquainting
ludloe
with
my
resolution
on
the
day
of
our
last
conversation
he
had
made
a
short
excursion
from
town
intending
to
return
the
same
evening
but
had
continued
absent
for
several
days
as
soon
as
he
came
back
i
hastened
to
acquaint
him
with
my
wishes
have
you
well
considered
this
matter
said
he
be
assured
it
is
of
no
trivial
import
the
moment
at
which
you
enter
the
presence
of
this
woman
will
decide
your
future
destiny
even
putting
out
of
view
the
subject
of
our
late
conversations
the
light
in
which
you
shall
appear
to
her
will
greatly
influence
your
happiness
since
though
you
can
not
fail
to
love
her
it
is
quite
uncertain
what
return
she
may
think
proper
to
make
much
doubtless
will
depend
on
your
own
perseverance
and
address
but
you
will
have
many
perhaps
insuperable
obstacles
to
encounter
on
several
accounts
and
especially
in
her
attachment
to
the
memory
of
her
late
husband
as
to
her
devout
temper
this
is
nearly
allied
to
a
warm
imagination
in
some
other
respects
and
will
operate
much
more
in
favour
of
an
ardent
and
artful
lover
than
against
him
i
still
expressed
my
willingness
to
try
my
fortune
with
her
well
said
he
i
anticipated
your
consent
to
my
proposal
and
the
visit
i
have
just
made
was
to
her
i
thought
it
best
to
pave
the
way
by
informing
her
that
i
had
met
with
one
for
whom
she
had
desired
me
to
look
out
you
must
know
that
her
father
was
one
of
these
singular
men
who
set
a
value
upon
things
exactly
in
proportion
to
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
or
comprehending
them
his
passion
was
for
antiques
and
his
favourite
pursuit
during
a
long
life
was
monuments
in
brass
marble
and
parchment
of
the
remotest
antiquity
he
was
wholly
indifferent
to
the
character
or
conduct
of
our
present
sovereign
and
his
ministers
but
was
extremely
solicitous
about
the
name
and
exploits
of
a
king
of
ireland
that
lived
two
or
three
centuries
before
the
flood
he
felt
no
curiosity
to
know
who
was
the
father
of
his
wife
child
but
would
travel
a
thousand
miles
and
consume
months
in
investigating
which
son
of
noah
it
was
that
first
landed
on
the
coast
of
munster
he
would
give
a
hundred
guineas
from
the
mint
for
a
piece
of
old
decayed
copper
no
bigger
than
his
nail
provided
it
had
aukward
characters
upon
it
too
much
defaced
to
be
read
the
whole
stock
of
a
great
bookseller
was
in
his
eyes
a
cheap
exchange
for
a
shred
of
parchment
containing
half
a
homily
written
by
patrick
he
would
have
gratefully
given
all
his
patrimonial
domains
to
one
who
should
inform
him
what
pendragon
or
druid
it
was
who
set
up
the
first
stone
on
salisbury
plain
this
spirit
as
you
may
readily
suppose
being
seconded
by
great
wealth
and
long
life
contributed
to
form
a
very
large
collection
of
venerable
lumber
which
though
beyond
all
price
to
the
collector
himself
is
of
no
value
to
his
heiress
but
so
far
as
it
is
marketable
she
designs
to
bring
the
whole
to
auction
but
for
this
purpose
a
catalogue
and
description
are
necessary
her
father
trusted
to
a
faithful
memory
and
to
vague
and
scarcely
legible
memorandums
and
has
left
a
very
arduous
task
to
any
one
who
shall
be
named
to
the
office
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
best
means
of
promoting
your
views
was
to
recommend
you
to
this
office
you
are
not
entirely
without
the
antiquarian
frenzy
yourself
the
employment
therefore
will
be
somewhat
agreeable
to
you
for
its
own
sake
it
will
entitle
you
to
become
an
inmate
of
the
same
house
and
thus
establish
an
incessant
intercourse
between
you
and
the
nature
of
the
business
is
such
that
you
may
perform
it
in
what
time
and
with
what
degree
of
diligence
and
accuracy
you
please
i
ventured
to
insinuate
that
to
a
woman
of
rank
and
family
the
character
of
a
hireling
was
by
no
means
a
favourable
recommendation
he
answered
that
he
proposed
by
the
account
he
should
give
of
me
to
obviate
every
scruple
of
that
nature
though
my
father
was
no
better
than
a
farmer
it
is
not
absolutely
certain
but
that
my
remoter
ancestors
had
princely
blood
in
their
veins
but
as
long
as
proofs
of
my
low
extraction
did
not
impertinently
intrude
themselves
my
silence
or
at
most
equivocal
surmises
seasonably
made
use
of
might
secure
me
from
all
inconveniences
on
the
score
of
birth
he
should
represent
me
and
i
was
such
as
his
friend
favourite
and
equal
and
my
passion
for
antiquities
should
be
my
principal
inducement
to
undertake
this
office
though
my
poverty
would
make
no
objection
to
a
reasonable
pecuniary
recompense
having
expressed
my
acquiescence
in
his
measures
he
thus
proceeded
my
visit
was
made
to
my
kinswoman
for
the
purpose
as
i
just
now
told
you
of
paving
your
way
into
her
family
but
on
my
arrival
at
her
house
i
found
nothing
but
disorder
and
alarm
benington
it
seems
on
returning
from
a
longer
ride
than
customary
last
thursday
evening
was
attacked
by
robbers
her
attendants
related
an
imperfect
tale
of
somebody
advancing
at
the
critical
moment
to
her
rescue
it
seems
however
they
did
more
harm
than
good
for
the
horses
took
to
flight
and
overturned
the
carriage
in
consequence
of
which
benington
was
severely
bruised
she
has
kept
her
bed
ever
since
and
a
fever
was
likely
to
ensue
which
has
only
left
her
out
of
danger
as
the
adventure
before
related
in
which
i
had
so
much
concern
occurred
at
the
time
mentioned
by
ludloe
and
as
all
other
circumstances
were
alike
i
could
not
doubt
that
the
person
whom
the
exertion
of
my
mysterious
powers
had
relieved
was
benington
but
what
an
interference
was
mine
the
robbers
would
probably
have
been
satisfied
with
the
few
guineas
in
her
purse
and
on
receiving
these
would
have
left
her
to
prosecute
her
journey
in
peace
and
security
but
by
absurdly
offering
a
succour
which
could
only
operate
upon
the
fears
of
her
assailants
i
endangered
her
life
first
by
the
desperate
discharge
of
a
pistol
and
next
by
the
fright
of
the
horses
my
anxiety
which
would
have
been
less
if
i
had
not
been
in
some
degree
myself
the
author
of
the
evil
was
nearly
removed
by
ludloe
proceeding
to
assure
me
that
all
danger
was
at
an
end
and
that
he
left
the
lady
in
the
road
to
perfect
health
he
had
seized
the
earliest
opportunity
of
acquainting
her
with
the
purpose
of
his
visit
and
had
brought
back
with
him
her
cheerful
acceptance
of
my
services
the
next
week
was
appointed
for
my
introduction
with
such
an
object
in
view
i
had
little
leisure
to
attend
to
any
indifferent
object
my
thoughts
were
continually
bent
upon
the
expected
introduction
and
my
impatience
and
curiosity
drew
strength
not
merely
from
the
character
of
benington
but
from
the
nature
of
my
new
employment
ludloe
had
truly
observed
that
i
was
infected
with
somewhat
of
this
antiquarian
mania
myself
and
i
now
remembered
that
benington
had
frequently
alluded
to
this
collection
in
possession
of
his
wife
my
curiosity
had
then
been
more
than
once
excited
by
his
representations
and
i
had
formed
a
vague
resolution
of
making
myself
acquainted
with
this
lady
and
her
learned
treasure
should
i
ever
return
to
ireland
other
incidents
had
driven
this
matter
from
my
mind
meanwhile
affairs
between
ludloe
and
myself
remained
stationary
our
conferences
which
were
regular
and
daily
related
to
general
topics
and
though
his
instructions
were
adapted
to
promote
my
improvement
in
the
most
useful
branches
of
knowledge
they
never
afforded
a
glimpse
towards
that
quarter
where
my
curiosity
was
most
active
the
next
week
now
arrived
but
ludloe
informed
me
that
the
state
of
benington
health
required
a
short
excursion
into
the
country
and
that
he
himself
proposed
to
bear
her
company
the
journey
was
to
last
about
a
fortnight
after
which
i
might
prepare
myself
for
an
introduction
to
her
this
was
a
very
unexpected
and
disagreeable
trial
to
my
patience
the
interval
of
solitude
that
now
succeeded
would
have
passed
rapidly
and
pleasantly
enough
if
an
event
of
so
much
moment
were
not
in
suspense
books
of
which
i
was
passionately
fond
would
have
afforded
me
delightful
and
incessant
occupation
and
ludloe
by
way
of
reconciling
me
to
unavoidable
delays
had
given
me
access
to
a
little
closet
in
which
his
rarer
and
more
valuable
books
were
kept
all
my
amusements
both
by
inclination
and
necessity
were
centered
in
myself
and
at
home
ludloe
appeared
to
have
no
visitants
and
though
frequently
abroad
or
at
least
secluded
from
me
had
never
proposed
my
introduction
to
any
of
his
friends
except
benington
my
obligations
to
him
were
already
too
great
to
allow
me
to
lay
claim
to
new
favours
and
indulgences
nor
indeed
was
my
disposition
such
as
to
make
society
needful
to
my
happiness
my
character
had
been
in
some
degree
modelled
by
the
faculty
which
i
possessed
this
deriving
all
its
supposed
value
from
impenetrable
secrecy
and
ludloe
admonitions
tending
powerfully
to
impress
me
with
the
necessity
of
wariness
and
circumspection
in
my
general
intercourse
with
mankind
i
had
gradually
fallen
into
sedate
reserved
mysterious
and
unsociable
habits
my
heart
wanted
not
a
friend
in
this
temper
of
mind
i
set
myself
to
examine
the
novelties
which
ludloe
private
contained
be
strange
thought
i
if
his
favourite
volume
do
not
show
some
marks
of
my
friend
character
to
know
a
man
favourite
or
most
constant
studies
can
not
fail
of
letting
in
some
little
light
upon
his
secret
thoughts
and
though
he
would
not
have
given
me
the
reading
of
these
books
if
he
had
thought
them
capable
of
unveiling
more
of
his
concerns
than
he
wished
yet
possibly
my
ingenuity
may
go
one
step
farther
than
he
dreams
of
you
shall
judge
whether
i
was
right
in
my
conjectures
chapter
ix
the
books
which
composed
this
little
library
were
chiefly
the
voyages
and
travels
of
the
missionaries
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
added
to
these
were
some
works
upon
political
economy
and
legislation
those
writers
who
have
amused
themselves
with
reducing
their
ideas
to
practice
and
drawing
imaginary
pictures
of
nations
or
republics
whose
manners
or
government
came
up
to
their
standard
of
excellence
were
all
of
whom
i
had
ever
heard
and
some
i
had
never
heard
of
before
to
be
found
in
this
collection
a
translation
of
aristotle
republic
the
political
romances
of
sir
thomas
moore
harrington
and
hume
appeared
to
have
been
much
read
and
ludlow
had
not
been
sparing
of
his
marginal
comments
in
these
writers
he
appeared
to
find
nothing
but
error
and
absurdity
and
his
notes
were
introduced
for
no
other
end
than
to
point
out
groundless
principles
and
false
conclusions
the
style
of
these
remarks
was
already
familiar
to
me
i
saw
nothing
new
in
them
or
different
from
the
strain
of
those
speculations
with
which
ludlow
was
accustomed
to
indulge
himself
in
conversation
with
me
after
having
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
printed
volumes
i
at
length
lighted
on
a
small
book
of
maps
from
which
of
course
i
could
reasonably
expect
no
information
on
that
point
about
which
i
was
most
curious
it
was
an
atlas
in
which
the
maps
had
been
drawn
by
the
pen
none
of
them
contained
any
thing
remarkable
so
far
as
i
who
was
indeed
a
smatterer
in
geography
was
able
to
perceive
till
i
came
to
the
end
when
i
noticed
a
map
whose
prototype
i
was
wholly
unacquainted
with
it
was
drawn
on
a
pretty
large
scale
representing
two
islands
which
bore
some
faint
resemblance
in
their
relative
proportions
at
least
to
great
britain
and
ireland
in
shape
they
were
widely
different
but
as
to
size
there
was
no
scale
by
which
to
measure
them
from
the
great
number
of
subdivisions
and
from
signs
which
apparently
represented
towns
and
cities
i
was
allowed
to
infer
that
the
country
was
at
least
as
extensive
as
the
british
isles
this
map
was
apparently
unfinished
for
it
had
no
names
inscribed
upon
it
i
have
just
said
my
geographical
knowledge
was
imperfect
though
i
had
not
enough
to
draw
the
outlines
of
any
country
by
memory
i
had
still
sufficient
to
recognize
what
i
had
before
seen
and
to
discover
that
none
of
the
larger
islands
in
our
globe
resembled
the
one
before
me
having
such
and
so
strong
motives
to
curiosity
you
may
easily
imagine
my
sensations
on
surveying
this
map
suspecting
as
i
did
that
many
of
ludlow
intimations
alluded
to
a
country
well
known
to
him
though
unknown
to
others
i
was
of
course
inclined
to
suppose
that
this
country
was
now
before
me
in
search
of
some
clue
to
this
mystery
i
carefully
inspected
the
other
maps
in
this
collection
in
a
map
of
the
eastern
hemisphere
i
soon
observed
the
outlines
of
islands
which
though
on
a
scale
greatly
diminished
were
plainly
similar
to
that
of
the
land
above
described
it
is
well
known
that
the
people
of
europe
are
strangers
to
very
nearly
one
half
of
the
surface
of
the
globe
from
the
south
pole
up
to
the
equator
it
is
only
the
small
space
occupied
by
southern
africa
and
by
south
america
with
which
we
are
acquainted
there
is
a
vast
extent
sufficient
to
receive
a
continent
as
large
as
north
america
which
our
ignorance
has
filled
only
with
water
in
ludlow
maps
nothing
was
still
to
be
seen
in
these
regions
but
water
except
in
that
spot
where
the
transverse
parallels
of
the
southern
tropic
and
the
degree
east
longitude
intersect
each
other
on
this
spot
were
ludlow
islands
placed
though
without
any
name
or
inscription
whatever
i
needed
not
to
be
told
that
this
spot
had
never
been
explored
by
any
european
voyager
who
had
published
his
adventures
what
authority
had
ludlow
for
fixing
a
habitable
land
in
this
spot
and
why
did
he
give
us
nothing
but
the
courses
of
shores
and
rivers
and
the
scite
of
towns
and
villages
without
a
name
as
soon
as
ludlow
had
set
out
upon
his
proposed
journey
of
a
fortnight
i
unlocked
his
closet
and
continued
rummaging
among
these
books
and
maps
till
night
by
that
time
i
had
turned
over
every
book
and
almost
every
leaf
in
this
small
collection
and
did
not
open
the
closet
again
till
near
the
end
of
that
period
meanwhile
i
had
many
reflections
upon
this
remarkable
circumstance
could
ludlow
have
intended
that
i
should
see
this
atlas
it
was
the
only
book
that
could
be
styled
a
manuscript
on
these
shelves
and
it
was
placed
beneath
several
others
in
a
situation
far
from
being
obvious
and
forward
to
the
eye
or
the
hand
was
it
an
oversight
in
him
to
leave
it
in
my
way
or
could
he
have
intended
to
lead
my
curiosity
and
knowledge
a
little
farther
onward
by
this
accidental
disclosure
in
either
case
how
was
i
to
regulate
my
future
deportment
toward
him
was
i
to
speak
and
act
as
if
this
atlas
had
escaped
my
attention
or
not
i
had
already
after
my
first
examination
of
it
placed
the
volume
exactly
where
i
found
it
on
every
supposition
i
thought
this
was
the
safest
way
and
unlocked
the
closet
a
second
time
to
see
that
all
was
precisely
in
the
original
order
how
was
i
dismayed
and
confounded
on
inspecting
the
shelves
to
perceive
that
the
atlas
was
gone
this
was
a
theft
which
from
the
closet
being
under
lock
and
key
and
the
key
always
in
my
own
pocket
and
which
from
the
very
nature
of
the
thing
stolen
could
not
be
imputed
to
any
of
the
domestics
after
a
few
moments
a
suspicion
occurred
which
was
soon
changed
into
certainty
by
applying
to
the
housekeeper
who
told
me
that
ludlow
had
returned
apparently
in
much
haste
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
he
had
set
out
upon
his
journey
and
just
after
i
had
left
the
house
that
he
had
gone
into
the
room
where
this
closet
of
books
was
and
after
a
few
minutes
stay
came
out
again
and
went
away
she
told
me
also
that
he
had
made
general
enquiries
after
me
to
which
she
had
answered
that
she
had
not
seen
me
during
the
day
and
supposed
that
i
had
spent
the
whole
of
it
abroad
from
this
account
it
was
plain
that
ludlow
had
returned
for
no
other
purpose
but
to
remove
this
book
out
of
my
reach
but
if
he
had
a
double
key
to
this
door
what
should
hinder
his
having
access
by
the
same
means
to
every
other
locked
up
place
in
the
house
this
suggestion
made
me
start
with
terror
of
so
obvious
a
means
for
possessing
a
knowledge
of
every
thing
under
his
roof
i
had
never
been
till
this
moment
aware
such
is
the
infatuation
which
lays
our
most
secret
thoughts
open
to
the
world
scrutiny
we
are
frequently
in
most
danger
when
we
deem
ourselves
most
safe
and
our
fortress
is
taken
sometimes
through
a
point
whose
weakness
nothing
it
should
seem
but
the
blindest
stupidity
could
overlook
my
terrors
indeed
quickly
subsided
when
i
came
to
recollect
that
there
was
nothing
in
any
closet
or
cabinet
of
mine
which
could
possibly
throw
light
upon
subjects
which
i
desired
to
keep
in
the
dark
the
more
carefully
i
inspected
my
own
drawers
and
the
more
i
reflected
on
the
character
of
ludlow
as
i
had
known
it
the
less
reason
did
there
appear
in
my
suspicions
but
i
drew
a
lesson
of
caution
from
this
circumstance
which
contributed
to
my
future
safety
from
this
incident
i
could
not
but
infer
ludlow
unwillingness
to
let
me
so
far
into
his
geographical
secret
as
well
as
the
certainty
of
that
suspicion
which
had
very
early
been
suggested
to
my
thoughts
that
ludlow
plans
of
civilization
had
been
carried
into
practice
in
some
unvisited
corner
of
the
world
it
was
strange
however
that
he
should
betray
himself
by
such
an
inadvertency
one
who
talked
so
confidently
of
his
own
powers
to
unveil
any
secret
of
mine
and
at
the
same
time
to
conceal
his
own
transactions
had
surely
committed
an
unpardonable
error
in
leaving
this
important
document
in
my
way
my
reverence
indeed
for
ludlow
was
such
that
i
sometimes
entertained
the
notion
that
this
seeming
oversight
was
in
truth
a
regular
contrivance
to
supply
me
with
a
knowledge
of
which
when
i
came
maturely
to
reflect
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
make
any
ill
use
there
is
no
use
in
relating
what
would
not
be
believed
and
should
i
publish
to
the
world
the
existence
of
islands
in
the
space
allotted
by
ludlow
maps
to
these
what
would
the
world
answer
that
whether
the
space
described
was
sea
or
land
was
of
no
importance
that
the
moral
and
political
condition
of
its
inhabitants
was
the
only
topic
worthy
of
rational
curiosity
since
i
had
gained
no
information
upon
this
point
since
i
had
nothing
to
disclose
but
vain
and
fantastic
surmises
i
might
as
well
be
ignorant
of
every
thing
thus
from
secretly
condemning
ludlow
imprudence
i
gradually
passed
to
admiration
of
his
policy
this
discovery
had
no
other
effect
than
to
stimulate
my
curiosity
to
keep
up
my
zeal
to
prosecute
the
journey
i
had
commenced
under
his
auspices
i
had
hitherto
formed
a
resolution
to
stop
where
i
was
in
confidence
to
wait
till
the
success
should
be
ascertained
of
my
projects
with
respect
to
benington
before
i
made
any
new
advance
in
the
perilous
and
mysterious
road
into
which
he
had
led
my
steps
but
before
this
tedious
fortnight
had
elapsed
i
was
grown
extremely
impatient
for
an
interview
and
had
nearly
resolved
to
undertake
whatever
obligation
he
should
lay
upon
me
this
obligation
was
indeed
a
heavy
one
since
it
included
the
confession
of
my
vocal
powers
in
itself
the
confession
was
little
to
possess
this
faculty
was
neither
laudable
nor
culpable
nor
had
it
been
exercised
in
a
way
which
i
should
be
very
much
ashamed
to
acknowledge
it
had
led
me
into
many
insincerities
and
artifices
which
though
not
justifiable
by
any
creed
was
entitled
to
some
excuse
on
the
score
of
youthful
ardour
and
temerity
the
true
difficulty
in
the
way
of
these
confessions
was
the
not
having
made
them
already
ludlow
had
long
been
entitled
to
this
confidence
and
though
the
existence
of
this
power
was
venial
or
wholly
innocent
the
obstinate
concealment
of
it
was
a
different
matter
and
would
certainly
expose
me
to
suspicion
and
rebuke
but
what
was
the
alternative
to
conceal
it
to
incur
those
dreadful
punishments
awarded
against
treason
in
this
particular
ludlow
menaces
still
rung
in
my
ears
and
appalled
my
heart
how
should
i
be
able
to
shun
them
by
concealing
from
every
one
what
i
concealed
from
him
how
was
my
concealment
of
such
a
faculty
to
be
suspected
or
proved
unless
i
betrayed
myself
who
could
betray
me
in
this
state
of
mind
i
resolved
to
confess
myself
to
ludlow
in
the
way
that
he
required
reserving
only
the
secret
of
this
faculty
awful
indeed
said
i
is
the
crisis
of
my
fate
if
ludlow
declarations
are
true
a
horrid
catastrophe
awaits
me
but
as
fast
as
my
resolutions
were
shaken
they
were
confirmed
anew
by
the
recollection
who
can
betray
me
but
myself
if
i
deny
who
is
there
can
prove
suspicion
can
never
light
upon
the
truth
if
it
does
it
can
never
be
converted
into
certainty
even
my
own
lips
can
not
confirm
it
since
who
will
believe
my
testimony
by
such
illusions
was
i
fortified
in
my
desperate
resolution
ludlow
returned
at
the
time
appointed
he
informed
me
that
benington
expected
me
next
morning
she
was
ready
to
depart
for
her
country
residence
where
she
proposed
to
spend
the
ensuing
summer
and
would
carry
me
along
with
her
in
consequence
of
this
arrangement
he
said
many
months
would
elapse
before
he
should
see
me
again
you
will
indeed
continued
he
be
pretty
much
shut
up
from
all
society
your
books
and
your
new
friend
will
be
your
chief
if
not
only
companions
her
life
is
not
a
social
one
because
she
has
formed
extravagant
notions
of
the
importance
of
lonely
worship
and
devout
solitude
much
of
her
time
will
be
spent
in
meditation
upon
pious
books
in
her
closet
some
of
it
in
long
solitary
rides
in
her
coach
for
the
sake
of
exercise
little
will
remain
for
eating
and
sleeping
so
that
unless
you
can
prevail
upon
her
to
violate
her
ordinary
rules
for
your
sake
you
will
be
left
pretty
much
to
yourself
you
will
have
the
more
time
to
reflect
upon
what
has
hitherto
been
the
theme
of
our
conversations
you
can
come
to
town
when
you
want
to
see
me
i
shall
generally
be
found
in
these
apartments
in
the
present
state
of
my
mind
though
impatient
to
see
benington
i
was
still
more
impatient
to
remove
the
veil
between
ludlow
and
myself
after
some
pause
i
ventured
to
enquire
if
there
was
any
impediment
to
my
advancement
in
the
road
he
had
already
pointed
out
to
my
curiosity
and
ambition
he
replied
with
great
solemnity
that
i
was
already
acquainted
with
the
next
step
to
be
taken
in
this
road
if
i
was
prepared
to
make
him
my
confessor
as
to
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
exception
or
but
what
arose
from
defect
of
memory
he
was
willing
to
receive
my
confession
i
declared
myself
ready
to
do
so
i
need
not
he
returned
remind
you
of
the
consequences
of
concealment
or
deceit
i
have
already
dwelt
upon
these
consequences
as
to
the
past
you
have
already
told
me
perhaps
all
that
is
of
any
moment
to
know
it
is
in
relation
to
the
future
that
caution
will
be
chiefly
necessary
hitherto
your
actions
have
been
nearly
indifferent
to
the
ends
of
your
future
existence
confessions
of
the
past
are
required
because
they
are
an
earnest
of
the
future
character
and
conduct
have
you
then
but
this
is
too
abrupt
take
an
hour
to
reflect
and
deliberate
go
by
yourself
take
yourself
to
severe
task
and
make
up
your
mind
with
a
full
entire
and
unfailing
resolution
for
the
moment
in
which
you
assume
this
new
obligation
will
make
you
a
new
being
perdition
or
felicity
will
hang
upon
that
moment
this
conversation
was
late
in
the
evening
after
i
had
consented
to
postpone
this
subject
we
parted
he
telling
me
that
he
would
leave
his
chamber
door
open
and
as
soon
as
my
mind
was
made
up
i
might
come
to
him
the
reader
must
be
reminded
that
the
incidents
of
this
narrative
are
supposed
to
have
taken
place
before
the
voyages
of
bougainville
and
editor
chapter
i
retired
accordingly
to
my
apartment
and
spent
the
prescribed
hour
in
anxious
and
irresolute
reflections
they
were
no
other
than
had
hitherto
occurred
but
they
occurred
with
more
force
than
ever
some
fatal
obstinacy
however
got
possession
of
me
and
i
persisted
in
the
resolution
of
concealing
we
become
fondly
attached
to
objects
and
pursuits
frequently
for
no
conceivable
reason
but
the
pain
and
trouble
they
cost
us
in
proportion
to
the
danger
in
which
they
involve
us
do
we
cherish
them
our
darling
potion
is
the
poison
that
scorches
our
vitals
after
some
time
i
went
to
ludloe
apartment
i
found
him
solemn
and
yet
benign
at
my
entrance
after
intimating
my
compliance
with
the
terms
prescribed
which
i
did
in
spite
of
all
my
labour
for
composure
with
accents
half
faultering
he
proceeded
to
put
various
questions
to
me
relative
to
my
early
history
i
knew
there
was
no
other
mode
of
accomplishing
the
end
in
view
but
by
putting
all
that
was
related
in
the
form
of
answers
to
questions
and
when
meditating
on
the
character
of
ludloe
i
experienced
excessive
uneasiness
as
to
the
consummate
art
and
penetration
which
his
questions
would
manifest
conscious
of
a
purpose
to
conceal
my
fancy
invested
my
friend
with
the
robe
of
a
judicial
inquisitor
all
whose
questions
should
aim
at
extracting
the
truth
and
entrapping
the
liar
in
this
respect
however
i
was
wholly
disappointed
all
his
inquiries
were
general
and
they
betokened
curiosity
but
not
suspicion
yet
there
were
moments
when
i
saw
or
fancied
i
saw
some
dissatisfaction
betrayed
in
his
features
and
when
i
arrived
at
that
period
of
my
story
which
terminated
with
my
departure
as
his
companion
for
europe
his
pauses
were
i
thought
a
little
longer
and
more
museful
than
i
liked
at
this
period
our
first
conference
ended
after
a
talk
which
had
commenced
at
a
late
hour
and
had
continued
many
hours
it
was
time
to
sleep
and
it
was
agreed
that
next
morning
the
conference
should
be
renewed
on
retiring
to
my
pillow
and
reviewing
all
the
circumstances
of
this
interview
my
mind
was
filled
with
apprehension
and
disquiet
i
seemed
to
recollect
a
thousand
things
which
showed
that
ludloe
was
not
fully
satisfied
with
my
part
in
this
interview
a
strange
and
nameless
mixture
of
wrath
and
of
pity
appeared
on
recollection
in
the
glances
which
from
time
to
time
he
cast
upon
me
some
emotion
played
upon
his
features
in
which
as
my
fears
conceived
there
was
a
tincture
of
resentment
and
ferocity
in
vain
i
called
my
usual
sophistries
to
my
aid
in
vain
i
pondered
on
the
inscrutable
nature
of
my
peculiar
faculty
in
vain
i
endeavoured
to
persuade
myself
that
by
telling
the
truth
instead
of
entitling
myself
to
ludloe
approbation
i
should
only
excite
his
anger
by
what
he
could
not
but
deem
an
attempt
to
impose
upon
his
belief
an
incredible
tale
of
impossible
events
i
had
never
heard
or
read
of
any
instance
of
this
faculty
i
supposed
the
case
to
be
absolutely
singular
and
i
should
be
no
more
entitled
to
credit
in
proclaiming
it
than
if
i
should
maintain
that
a
certain
billet
of
wood
possessed
the
faculty
of
articulate
speech
it
was
now
however
too
late
to
retract
i
had
been
guilty
of
a
solemn
and
deliberate
concealment
i
was
now
in
the
path
in
which
there
was
no
turning
back
and
i
must
go
forward
the
return
of
day
encouraging
beams
in
some
degree
quieted
my
nocturnal
terrors
and
i
went
at
the
appointed
hour
to
presence
i
found
him
with
a
much
more
cheerful
aspect
than
i
expected
and
began
to
chide
myself
in
secret
for
the
folly
of
my
late
apprehensions
after
a
little
pause
he
reminded
me
that
he
was
only
one
among
many
engaged
in
a
great
and
arduous
design
as
each
of
us
continued
he
is
mortal
each
of
us
must
in
time
yield
his
post
to
each
of
us
is
ambitious
to
provide
himself
a
successor
to
have
his
place
filled
by
one
selected
and
instructed
by
himself
all
our
personal
feelings
and
affections
are
by
no
means
intended
to
be
swallowed
up
by
a
passion
for
the
general
interest
when
they
can
be
kept
alive
and
be
brought
into
play
in
subordination
and
subservience
to
the
they
are
cherished
as
useful
and
revered
as
laudable
and
whatever
austerity
and
rigour
you
may
impute
to
my
character
there
are
few
more
susceptible
of
personal
regards
than
i
am
you
can
not
know
till
are
what
am
what
deep
what
interest
i
have
in
the
success
of
my
tutorship
on
this
occasion
most
joyfully
would
i
embrace
a
thousand
deaths
rather
than
that
you
should
prove
a
recreant
the
consequences
of
any
failure
in
your
integrity
will
it
is
true
be
fatal
to
yourself
but
there
are
some
minds
of
a
generous
texture
who
are
more
impatient
under
ills
they
have
inflicted
upon
others
than
of
those
they
have
brought
upon
themselves
who
had
rather
perish
themselves
in
infamy
than
bring
infamy
or
death
upon
a
benefactor
perhaps
of
such
noble
materials
is
your
mind
composed
if
i
had
not
thought
so
you
would
never
have
been
an
object
of
my
regard
and
therefore
in
the
motives
that
shall
impel
you
to
fidelity
sincerity
and
perseverance
some
regard
to
my
happiness
and
welfare
will
no
doubt
have
place
and
yet
i
exact
nothing
from
you
on
this
score
if
your
own
safety
be
insufficient
to
controul
you
you
are
not
fit
for
us
there
is
indeed
abundant
need
of
all
possible
inducements
to
make
you
faithful
the
task
of
concealing
nothing
from
me
must
be
easy
that
of
concealing
every
thing
from
others
must
be
the
only
arduous
one
the
you
can
hardly
fail
of
performing
when
the
exigence
requires
it
for
what
motive
can
you
possibly
have
to
practice
evasion
or
disguise
with
me
you
have
surely
committed
no
crime
you
have
neither
robbed
nor
murdered
nor
betrayed
if
you
have
there
is
no
room
for
the
fear
of
punishment
or
the
terror
of
disgrace
to
step
in
and
make
you
hide
your
guilt
from
me
you
can
not
dread
any
further
disclosure
because
i
can
have
no
interest
in
your
ruin
or
your
shame
and
what
evil
could
ensue
the
confession
of
the
foulest
murder
even
before
a
bench
of
magistrates
more
dreadful
than
that
which
will
inevitably
follow
the
practice
of
the
least
concealment
to
me
or
the
least
undue
disclosure
to
others
you
can
not
easily
conceive
the
emphatical
solemnity
with
which
this
was
spoken
had
he
fixed
piercing
eyes
on
me
while
he
spoke
had
i
perceived
him
watching
my
looks
and
labouring
to
penetrate
my
secret
thoughts
i
should
doubtless
have
been
ruined
but
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
floor
and
no
gesture
or
look
indicated
the
smallest
suspicion
of
my
conduct
after
some
pause
he
continued
in
a
more
pathetic
tone
while
his
whole
frame
seemed
to
partake
of
his
mental
agitation
i
am
greatly
at
a
loss
by
what
means
to
impress
you
with
a
full
conviction
of
the
truth
of
what
i
have
just
said
endless
are
the
sophistries
by
which
we
seduce
ourselves
into
perilous
and
doubtful
paths
what
we
do
not
see
we
disbelieve
or
we
heed
not
the
sword
may
descend
upon
our
infatuated
head
from
above
but
we
who
are
meanwhile
busily
inspecting
the
ground
at
our
feet
or
gazing
at
the
scene
around
us
are
not
aware
or
apprehensive
of
its
irresistible
coming
in
this
case
it
must
not
be
seen
before
it
is
felt
or
before
that
time
comes
when
the
danger
of
incurring
it
is
over
i
can
not
withdraw
the
veil
and
disclose
to
your
view
the
exterminating
angel
all
must
be
vacant
and
blank
and
the
danger
that
stands
armed
with
death
at
your
elbow
must
continue
to
be
totally
invisible
till
that
moment
when
its
vengeance
is
provoked
or
unprovokable
i
will
do
my
part
to
encourage
you
in
good
or
intimidate
you
from
evil
i
am
anxious
to
set
before
you
all
the
motives
which
are
fitted
to
influence
your
conduct
but
how
shall
i
work
on
your
convictions
here
another
pause
ensued
which
i
had
not
courage
enough
to
interrupt
he
presently
resumed
perhaps
you
recollect
a
visit
which
you
paid
on
christmas
day
in
the
year
to
the
cathedral
church
at
toledo
do
you
remember
a
moment
reflection
recalled
to
my
mind
all
the
incidents
of
that
day
i
had
good
reason
to
remember
them
i
felt
no
small
trepidation
when
ludloe
referred
me
to
that
day
for
at
the
moment
i
was
doubtful
whether
there
had
not
been
some
bivocal
agency
exerted
on
that
occasion
luckily
however
it
was
almost
the
only
similar
occasion
in
which
it
had
been
wholly
silent
i
answered
in
the
affirmative
i
remember
them
perfectly
and
yet
said
ludloe
with
a
smile
that
seemed
intended
to
disarm
this
declaration
of
some
of
its
terrors
i
suspect
your
recollection
is
not
as
exact
as
mine
nor
indeed
your
knowledge
as
extensive
you
met
there
for
the
first
time
a
female
whose
nominal
uncle
but
real
father
a
dean
of
that
ancient
church
resided
in
a
blue
stone
house
the
third
from
the
west
angle
of
the
square
of
jago
all
this
was
exactly
true
this
female
continued
he
fell
in
love
with
you
her
passion
made
her
deaf
to
all
the
dictates
of
modesty
and
duty
and
she
gave
you
sufficient
intimations
in
subsequent
interviews
at
the
same
place
of
this
passion
which
she
being
fair
and
enticing
you
were
not
slow
in
comprehending
and
returning
as
not
only
the
safety
of
your
intercourse
but
even
of
both
your
lives
depended
on
being
shielded
even
from
suspicion
the
utmost
wariness
and
caution
was
observed
in
all
your
proceedings
tell
me
whether
you
succeeded
in
your
efforts
to
this
end
i
replied
that
at
the
time
i
had
no
doubt
but
i
had
and
yet
said
he
drawing
something
from
his
pocket
and
putting
it
into
my
hand
there
is
the
slip
of
paper
with
the
preconcerted
emblem
inscribed
upon
it
which
the
infatuated
girl
dropped
in
your
sight
one
evening
in
the
left
aisle
of
that
church
that
paper
you
imagined
you
afterwards
burnt
in
your
chamber
lamp
in
pursuance
of
this
token
you
deferred
your
intended
visit
and
next
day
the
lady
was
accidentally
drowned
in
passing
a
river
here
ended
your
connexion
with
her
and
with
her
was
buried
as
you
thought
all
memory
of
this
transaction
i
leave
you
to
draw
your
own
inference
from
this
disclosure
meditate
upon
it
when
alone
recal
all
the
incidents
of
that
drama
and
labour
to
conceive
the
means
by
which
my
sagacity
has
been
able
to
reach
events
that
took
place
so
far
off
and
under
so
deep
a
covering
if
you
can
not
penetrate
these
means
learn
to
reverence
my
assertions
that
i
can
not
be
deceived
and
let
sincerity
be
henceforth
the
rule
of
your
conduct
towards
me
not
merely
because
it
is
right
but
because
concealment
is
impossible
we
will
stop
here
there
is
no
haste
required
of
us
discourse
will
suffice
for
and
for
many
days
to
come
let
what
has
already
taken
place
be
the
subject
of
profound
and
mature
reflection
review
once
more
the
incidents
of
your
early
life
previous
to
your
introduction
to
me
and
at
our
next
conference
prepare
to
supply
all
those
deficiencies
occasioned
by
negligence
forgetfulness
or
design
on
our
first
there
must
be
some
there
must
be
many
the
whole
truth
can
only
be
disclosed
after
numerous
and
repeated
conversations
these
must
take
place
at
considerable
intervals
and
when
is
told
then
shall
you
be
ready
to
encounter
the
final
ordeal
and
load
yourself
with
heavy
and
terrific
sanctions
i
shall
be
the
proper
judge
of
the
completeness
of
your
knowing
previously
and
by
unerring
means
your
whole
history
i
shall
be
able
to
detect
all
that
is
deficient
as
well
as
all
that
is
redundant
your
confessions
have
hitherto
adhered
to
the
truth
but
deficient
they
are
and
they
must
be
for
who
at
a
single
trial
can
detail
the
secrets
of
his
life
whose
recollection
can
fully
serve
him
at
an
instant
notice
who
can
free
himself
by
a
single
effort
from
the
dominion
of
fear
and
shame
we
expect
no
miracles
of
fortitude
and
purity
from
our
disciples
it
is
our
discipline
our
wariness
our
laborious
preparation
that
creates
the
excellence
we
have
among
us
we
find
it
not
ready
made
i
counsel
you
to
join
benington
without
delay
you
may
see
me
when
and
as
often
as
you
please
when
it
is
proper
to
renew
the
present
topic
it
shall
be
renewed
till
then
we
will
be
here
ludloe
left
me
alone
but
not
to
indifference
or
vacuity
indeed
i
was
overwhelmed
with
the
reflections
that
arose
from
this
conversation
so
said
i
i
am
still
saved
if
i
have
wisdom
enough
to
use
the
opportunity
from
the
consequences
of
past
concealments
by
a
distinction
which
i
had
wholly
overlooked
but
which
could
not
be
missed
by
the
sagacity
and
equity
of
ludloe
i
have
praise
for
telling
the
truth
and
an
excuse
for
withholding
some
of
the
truth
it
was
indeed
a
praise
to
which
i
was
entitled
for
i
have
made
no
to
the
tale
of
my
early
adventures
i
had
no
motive
to
exaggerate
or
dress
out
in
false
colours
what
i
sought
to
conceal
i
was
careful
to
exclude
entirely
that
a
lame
or
defective
narrative
might
awaken
no
suspicions
the
allusion
to
incidents
at
toledo
confounded
and
bewildered
all
my
thoughts
i
still
held
the
paper
he
had
given
me
so
far
as
memory
could
be
trusted
it
was
the
same
which
an
hour
after
i
had
received
it
i
burnt
as
i
conceived
with
my
own
hands
how
ludloe
came
into
possession
of
this
paper
how
he
was
apprised
of
incidents
to
which
only
the
female
mentioned
and
myself
were
privy
which
she
had
too
good
reason
to
hide
from
all
the
world
and
which
i
had
taken
infinite
pains
to
bury
in
oblivion
i
vainly
endeavoured
to
conjecture
