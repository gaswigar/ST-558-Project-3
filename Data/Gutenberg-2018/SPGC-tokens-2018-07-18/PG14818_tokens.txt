frontispiece
for
a
minute
or
two
at
least
he
whispered
a
baby
alive
and
warm
lay
packed
in
the
blankets
september
brought
elsie
banks
the
teacher
was
amazingly
pretty
on
this
eventful
night
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
the
haunted
house
wicker
bonner
rosalie
was
no
match
for
the
huge
woman
she
shrank
back
from
another
blow
which
seemed
impending
left
the
young
man
to
the
care
of
an
excellent
nurse
think
i
understand
rosalie
beg
your
pardon
he
said
humbly
it
was
a
wise
discreet
old
oak
the
huge
automobile
had
struck
the
washout
chapter
i
anderson
crow
detective
he
was
imposing
even
in
his
pensiveness
there
was
no
denying
the
fact
that
he
was
an
important
personage
in
tinkletown
and
to
the
residents
of
tinkletown
that
meant
a
great
deal
for
was
not
their
village
a
perpetual
monument
to
the
american
revolution
even
the
most
generalising
of
historians
were
compelled
to
devote
at
least
a
paragraph
to
the
battle
of
tinkletown
while
some
of
the
more
enlightened
gave
a
whole
page
and
a
picture
of
the
conflict
that
brought
glory
to
the
sleepy
inhabitants
whose
ancestors
were
enterprising
enough
to
annihilate
a
whole
company
of
british
redcoats
once
on
a
time
notwithstanding
all
this
a
particularly
disagreeable
visitor
from
the
city
once
remarked
in
the
presence
of
half
a
dozen
descendants
after
waiting
twenty
minutes
at
the
for
a
dime
worth
of
stamps
that
tinkletown
was
indeed
a
monument
but
he
could
not
understand
why
the
dead
had
been
left
unburied
there
was
excellent
cause
for
resentment
but
the
young
man
and
his
stamps
were
far
away
before
the
full
force
of
the
slander
penetrated
the
brains
of
the
listeners
anderson
crow
was
as
imposing
and
as
rugged
as
the
tallest
shaft
of
marble
in
the
little
cemetery
on
the
edge
of
the
town
no
one
questioned
his
power
and
authority
no
one
misjudged
his
altitude
and
no
one
overlooked
his
dignity
for
years
he
had
served
tinkletown
and
himself
in
the
triple
capacity
of
town
marshal
fire
chief
and
street
commissioner
he
had
a
system
of
government
peculiarly
his
own
and
no
one
possessed
the
heart
or
temerity
to
upset
it
no
matter
what
may
have
been
the
political
inducements
it
would
have
been
like
trying
to
improve
the
laws
of
nature
to
put
a
new
man
in
his
place
he
had
become
a
fixture
that
only
dissolution
could
remove
be
it
said
however
that
dissolution
did
not
have
its
common
and
accepted
meaning
when
applied
to
anderson
crow
for
instance
in
discoursing
upon
the
obnoxious
habits
of
the
town
most
dissolute
rake
alf
reesling
anderson
had
more
than
once
ventured
the
opinion
that
he
was
carrying
his
dissolution
entirely
too
far
and
had
not
anderson
crow
risen
to
more
than
local
distinction
had
not
his
fame
gone
abroad
throughout
the
land
not
only
was
he
the
marshal
of
tinkletown
at
a
salary
of
a
year
but
he
was
president
of
the
county
detectives
association
and
also
a
delegate
to
the
state
convention
of
the
sons
of
the
revolution
along
that
line
let
it
be
added
every
parent
in
tinkletown
bemoaned
the
birth
of
a
daughter
because
that
simple
circumstance
of
origin
robbed
the
society
roster
of
a
new
name
anderson
crow
at
the
age
of
had
a
proud
official
record
behind
him
and
a
guaranteed
future
ahead
doubtless
it
was
of
this
that
he
was
thinking
as
he
leaned
pensively
against
the
town
and
gingerly
chewed
the
blade
of
which
dangled
even
below
the
chin
whiskers
that
had
been
with
him
for
twenty
years
the
faraway
expression
in
his
eyes
gave
evidence
that
he
was
as
great
reminiscently
as
he
was
personally
so
successful
had
been
his
career
as
a
law
preserver
that
of
late
years
no
had
had
the
courage
to
ply
his
nefarious
games
in
the
community
the
town
drunkard
alf
reesling
seldom
appeared
on
the
streets
in
his
habitual
condition
because
as
he
dolefully
remarked
he
would
deserve
arrest
and
confinement
for
criminal
negligence
if
for
nothing
else
the
marshal
fame
as
a
detective
had
long
since
escaped
from
the
narrow
confines
of
tinkletown
he
was
well
known
at
the
county
seat
and
on
no
less
than
three
occasions
had
his
name
mentioned
in
the
big
city
papers
in
connection
with
the
arrest
of
notorious
and
now
the
whole
town
was
trembling
with
a
new
excitement
due
to
the
recognition
accorded
her
triple
official
on
monday
morning
he
had
ventured
forth
from
his
office
in
the
calaboose
resplendent
in
a
star
by
noon
everybody
in
town
knew
that
he
was
a
genuine
detective
a
member
of
the
great
organisation
known
as
the
new
york
imperial
detective
association
and
that
fresh
honour
had
come
to
tinkletown
through
the
agency
of
a
generation
the
beauty
of
it
all
was
that
anderson
never
lost
a
shred
of
his
serenity
in
explaining
how
the
association
had
implored
him
to
join
its
forces
even
going
so
far
as
to
urge
him
to
come
to
new
york
city
where
he
could
assist
and
advise
in
all
of
its
large
operations
and
moreover
he
had
been
obliged
to
pay
but
ten
dollars
membership
fee
besides
buying
the
blazing
star
for
the
paltry
sum
of
three
dollars
and
a
quarter
every
on
this
bright
spring
morning
offered
a
respectful
howdy
to
anderson
crow
whose
only
recognition
was
a
slow
and
imposing
nod
of
the
head
once
only
was
he
driven
to
relinquish
his
pensive
attitude
and
that
was
when
an
impertinent
fly
undertook
to
rest
for
a
brief
spell
upon
the
star
never
was
more
energetically
put
to
flight
but
even
as
the
tinkletown
posed
in
restful
supremacy
there
were
rushing
down
upon
him
affairs
of
the
kind
up
in
the
clear
lazy
sky
a
thunderbolt
was
preparing
to
hurl
itself
into
the
very
heart
of
tinkletown
and
at
the
very
head
of
anderson
crow
afterward
it
was
recalled
by
observing
citizens
that
just
before
noon
seven
minutes
to
twelve
in
fact
a
small
cloud
no
bigger
than
the
proverbial
hand
crossed
the
sun
hurriedly
as
if
afraid
to
tarry
at
that
very
instant
a
stranger
drove
up
to
the
bringing
his
horse
to
a
standstill
so
abruptly
in
front
of
the
marshal
nose
that
that
dignitary
hat
fell
off
backward
whoa
came
clearly
and
unmistakably
from
the
lips
of
the
stranger
who
held
the
reins
half
a
dozen
loafers
on
the
steps
were
positive
that
he
said
nothing
more
a
fact
that
was
afterward
worth
remembering
here
exclaimed
anderson
crow
wrathfully
do
you
know
what
doin
consarn
you
i
beg
pardon
everybody
within
hearing
heard
the
young
man
say
is
this
the
city
of
tinkletown
he
said
city
they
could
swear
every
man
son
of
them
yes
it
is
answered
the
marshal
severely
what
of
it
that
all
i
just
wanted
to
know
where
the
store
which
store
quite
crossly
the
stranger
seemed
nonplussed
at
this
have
you
more
than
oh
to
be
sure
i
should
say
where
is
the
store
apologised
the
stranger
well
this
is
a
good
one
i
reckon
said
crow
laconically
indicating
the
and
general
store
will
you
be
good
enough
to
hold
my
horse
while
i
run
in
there
for
a
minute
calmly
asked
the
new
arrival
in
town
springing
lightly
from
the
buggy
anderson
crow
almost
staggered
beneath
this
indignity
the
crowd
gasped
and
then
waited
breathlessly
for
the
withering
process
why
why
you
sir
what
do
you
think
i
am
a
exploded
on
the
lips
of
the
new
detective
his
face
was
flaming
red
you
have
to
excuse
me
my
good
man
but
i
thought
i
saw
a
as
i
drove
up
ah
here
it
is
how
careless
of
me
but
say
i
wo
be
in
the
store
more
than
a
second
and
it
does
seem
worth
while
to
tie
the
old
if
you
just
watch
him
or
her
for
a
minute
i
be
greatly
obliged
and
watch
your
own
horse
roared
the
marshal
thunderously
do
get
huffy
cried
the
young
man
cheerily
it
will
be
worth
a
quarter
to
you
do
you
know
who
i
am
demanded
anderson
crow
purple
to
the
roots
of
his
goatee
yes
sir
i
know
perfectly
well
but
i
refuse
to
give
it
away
here
take
the
bit
old
chap
and
hold
dobbin
for
about
a
minute
and
half
went
on
the
stranger
ruthlessly
and
before
anderson
crow
knew
what
had
happened
he
was
actually
holding
the
panting
nag
by
the
bit
the
young
man
went
up
the
steps
three
at
a
time
almost
upsetting
uncle
gideon
luce
who
had
not
been
so
spry
as
the
others
in
clearing
the
way
for
him
the
crowd
had
ample
time
in
which
to
study
the
face
apparel
and
manner
of
this
energetic
young
man
that
he
was
from
the
city
and
well
dressed
there
was
no
doubt
he
was
tall
and
his
face
was
beardless
that
much
could
be
seen
at
a
glance
somehow
he
seemed
to
be
laughing
all
the
time
a
fact
that
was
afterward
recalled
with
some
surprise
and
no
little
horror
at
the
time
the
loungers
thought
his
smile
was
a
merry
one
but
afterward
they
stoutly
maintained
there
was
downright
villainy
in
the
leer
his
coat
was
very
dusty
proving
that
he
had
driven
far
and
swiftly
three
or
four
of
the
loungers
followed
him
into
the
store
he
was
standing
before
the
counter
over
which
lamson
served
his
in
one
hand
he
held
an
envelope
and
in
the
other
his
straw
hat
george
ray
more
observant
than
the
rest
took
note
of
the
fact
that
it
was
with
the
hat
that
he
was
fanning
himself
vigorously
a
plain
vanilla
please
rush
it
along
commanded
the
stranger
lamson
if
possible
slower
than
the
town
itself
actually
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
acceleration
tossing
off
the
soda
the
stranger
dried
his
lips
with
a
white
handkerchief
is
this
the
he
asked
yep
said
lamson
who
was
too
penurious
to
waste
words
anything
here
for
me
demanded
the
newcomer
i
see
said
the
postmaster
and
from
force
of
habit
began
looking
through
the
pile
of
letters
without
asking
the
man
name
lamson
knew
everybody
in
the
county
nothing
here
taking
off
his
spectacles
conclusively
i
did
think
there
was
said
the
other
complacently
give
me
a
bottle
of
witch
hazel
a
package
of
invisible
and
a
box
of
parlor
matches
quick
i
in
a
hurry
did
you
say
no
sir
i
said
we
have
any
that
ai
visible
how
would
do
never
mind
give
me
the
bottle
and
the
matches
said
the
other
glancing
at
a
very
handsome
gold
watch
is
the
old
man
still
holding
my
horse
he
called
to
a
citizen
near
the
door
seven
necks
stretched
simultaneously
to
accommodate
him
and
seven
voices
answered
in
the
affirmative
the
stranger
calmly
opened
the
box
of
matches
filled
his
silver
and
then
threw
the
box
back
on
the
counter
an
piece
of
profligacy
in
those
parts
need
mind
wrapping
up
the
bottle
he
said
do
you
care
for
these
matches
asked
lamson
in
mild
surprise
i
donate
them
to
the
church
said
the
other
tossing
a
coin
upon
the
counter
and
dashing
from
the
store
the
crowd
ebbed
along
behind
him
gentle
as
a
lamb
is
he
he
called
to
anderson
crow
who
still
clutched
the
bit
much
obliged
sir
i
do
as
much
for
you
some
day
if
you
ever
in
new
york
hunt
me
up
and
i
see
that
you
have
a
good
time
what
road
do
i
take
to
crow
cliff
turn
to
your
left
here
said
anderson
crow
before
he
thought
then
he
called
himself
a
fool
for
being
so
obliging
to
the
fellow
how
far
is
it
from
here
mile
and
a
half
again
answered
crow
helplessly
this
time
he
almost
swore
under
his
breath
but
he
ca
get
there
volunteered
one
of
the
bystanders
why
ca
he
demanded
the
marshal
bridge
over
turnip
creek
is
washed
out
did
you
forget
that
of
course
not
promptly
replied
crow
who
forgotten
it
but
dang
it
he
swim
ca
he
you
say
the
bridge
is
gone
asked
the
stranger
visibly
excited
yes
and
the
crick
too
high
to
ford
too
well
how
in
thunder
am
i
to
get
to
crow
cliff
there
another
bridge
four
miles
upstream
it
still
there
said
george
ray
anderson
crow
had
scornfully
washed
his
hands
of
the
affair
confound
the
luck
i
have
time
to
drive
that
far
i
have
to
be
there
at
twelve
i
late
now
is
there
no
way
to
get
across
this
miserable
creek
he
was
in
the
buggy
now
whip
in
hand
and
his
eyes
wore
an
anxious
expression
some
of
the
men
vowed
later
that
he
positively
looked
frightened
there
a
high
and
dry
and
you
can
walk
across
but
you
get
the
horse
and
buggy
over
said
one
of
the
men
well
that
just
what
i
have
to
do
say
mr
officer
suppose
you
drive
me
down
to
the
creek
and
then
bring
the
horse
back
here
to
a
livery
stable
i
pay
you
well
for
it
i
must
get
to
crow
cliff
in
fifteen
minutes
i
no
cried
anderson
crow
so
wrathfully
that
two
or
three
boys
snickered
you
a
darned
old
crank
that
what
you
are
exclaimed
the
stranger
angrily
everybody
gasped
and
crow
staggered
back
against
the
see
here
young
man
none
o
that
he
sputtered
you
ca
talk
that
way
to
an
officer
of
the
law
i
you
wo
do
anything
do
you
hear
that
but
if
you
knew
who
i
am
be
doing
something
blamed
quick
a
dozen
men
heard
him
say
it
and
they
remembered
it
word
for
word
you
go
scratch
yourself
retorted
anderson
crow
scornfully
that
was
supposed
to
be
a
terrible
challenge
but
the
stranger
took
no
notice
of
it
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
horse
and
buggy
he
growled
half
to
himself
i
bought
the
darned
thing
outright
up
in
boggs
city
just
because
the
liveryman
did
know
me
and
would
let
me
a
rig
now
i
suppose
i
have
to
take
the
old
plug
down
to
the
creek
and
drown
him
in
order
to
get
rid
of
him
nobody
remonstrated
he
looked
a
bit
dangerous
with
his
broad
shoulders
and
square
jaw
what
will
you
give
me
for
the
outfit
horse
buggy
harness
and
all
i
sell
cheap
if
some
one
makes
a
quick
offer
the
bystanders
looked
at
one
another
blankly
and
at
last
the
concentrated
gaze
fell
upon
the
of
the
town
the
case
seemed
to
be
one
that
called
for
his
attention
truly
it
did
not
look
like
public
property
this
astounding
proposition
what
you
so
derned
anxious
to
sell
for
demanded
anderson
crow
listening
from
a
distance
to
see
if
he
could
detect
a
blemish
in
the
horse
breathing
gear
at
a
glance
the
buggy
looked
safe
enough
i
anxious
to
sell
for
cash
replied
the
stranger
and
anderson
was
floored
the
boy
who
snickered
this
time
had
cause
to
regret
it
for
crow
arrested
him
half
an
hour
later
for
carrying
a
i
paid
a
hundred
dollars
for
the
outfit
in
boggs
city
went
on
the
stranger
nervously
some
one
make
an
offer
and
quick
i
in
a
rush
i
give
five
dollars
said
one
of
the
onlookers
with
an
apologetic
laugh
this
was
the
match
that
started
fire
in
the
thrifty
noddles
of
tinkletown
best
citizens
before
they
knew
it
they
were
bidding
against
each
other
with
the
true
instinct
and
the
offers
had
reached
when
the
stranger
unceremoniously
closed
the
sale
by
crying
out
sold
there
is
no
telling
how
high
the
bids
might
have
gone
if
he
could
have
waited
half
an
hour
or
so
uncle
gideon
luce
afterward
said
that
he
could
have
had
dollars
just
as
well
as
not
they
were
bidding
up
a
quarter
at
a
time
and
no
one
seemed
willing
to
drop
out
the
successful
bidder
was
anderson
crow
you
can
pay
me
as
we
drive
along
jump
in
cried
the
stranger
looking
at
his
watch
with
considerable
agitation
all
i
ask
is
that
you
drive
me
to
the
that
crosses
the
creek
chapter
ii
the
pursuit
begins
fifteen
minutes
later
anderson
crow
was
parading
proudly
about
the
town
he
had
taken
the
stranger
to
the
creek
and
had
seen
him
scurry
across
the
log
to
the
opposite
side
supplied
with
directions
that
would
lead
him
to
the
nearest
route
through
the
swamps
and
timberland
to
cliff
the
stranger
had
anderson
money
in
his
pocket
but
anderson
had
a
very
respectable
sort
of
driving
outfit
to
show
for
it
his
wife
kept
dinner
for
him
until
two
and
then
sent
the
youngest
crow
out
to
tell
her
father
that
he
have
to
go
hungry
until
it
is
no
wonder
that
anderson
failed
to
reach
home
in
time
for
the
midday
meal
he
started
home
properly
enough
but
what
progress
could
he
make
when
everybody
in
town
stopped
him
to
inquire
about
the
remarkable
deal
and
to
have
a
look
at
the
purchase
without
a
single
dissenting
voice
tinkletown
said
anderson
had
very
much
the
best
of
the
bargain
george
ray
meant
all
right
when
he
said
a
fool
for
luck
but
he
was
obliged
to
explain
thoroughly
the
witticism
before
the
proud
crow
could
consider
himself
appeased
it
was
not
until
he
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
establishment
to
tell
the
reporter
the
news
that
his
equanimity
received
its
first
jar
he
was
quite
proud
of
the
deal
and
moreover
he
enjoyed
seeing
his
name
in
the
paper
in
the
meantime
almost
everybody
in
tinkletown
was
discussing
the
awful
profligacy
of
the
stranger
it
had
not
occurred
to
anybody
to
wonder
why
he
had
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
reach
crow
cliff
a
wild
desolate
spot
down
the
river
the
hoss
alone
is
worth
fifty
dollars
easy
volunteered
crow
triumphantly
the
detective
badge
on
his
inflated
chest
seemed
to
sparkle
with
glee
say
anderson
is
it
a
little
queer
that
he
should
sell
out
so
cheap
asked
harry
squires
the
local
reporter
and
pressfeeder
what
that
demanded
anderson
crow
sharply
do
you
think
it
really
true
that
he
bought
the
nag
up
at
boggs
city
asked
the
sceptic
crow
wallowed
his
quid
of
tobacco
helplessly
for
a
minute
or
two
he
could
feel
himself
turning
pale
he
said
so
ai
that
enough
he
managed
to
bluster
it
seems
to
have
been
replied
harry
who
had
gone
to
night
school
in
albany
for
two
years
well
what
in
thunder
are
you
talking
about
then
exclaimed
anderson
crow
whipping
up
i
bet
three
dollars
it
a
stolen
outfit
you
go
to
halifax
shouted
anderson
but
his
heart
was
cold
something
told
him
that
harry
squires
was
right
he
drove
home
in
a
state
of
dire
uncertainty
and
distress
somehow
his
enthusiasm
was
gone
dang
it
he
said
without
reason
as
he
was
unhitching
the
horse
in
the
barn
lot
hey
mr
crow
cried
a
shrill
voice
from
the
street
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
small
boy
coming
on
the
run
what
up
toby
asked
crow
all
he
knew
they
just
got
a
telephone
from
boggs
city
panted
the
boy
down
to
the
office
harry
squires
says
for
you
to
hurry
down
buggy
and
all
it
been
stole
good
lord
gasped
anderson
his
badge
danced
before
his
eyes
and
then
seemed
to
shrivel
quite
a
crowd
had
collected
at
the
office
there
was
a
sudden
hush
when
the
marshal
drove
up
even
the
horse
felt
the
intensity
of
the
moment
he
shied
at
a
dog
and
then
kicked
over
the
dashboard
upsetting
anderson
crow
meagre
dignity
and
almost
doing
the
same
to
the
vehicle
you
a
fine
detective
jeered
harry
squires
and
poor
old
anderson
hated
him
ever
afterward
what
have
you
heerd
demanded
the
marshal
there
been
a
terrible
murder
at
boggs
city
that
all
the
chief
of
police
just
telephoned
to
us
that
a
farmer
named
grover
was
found
dead
in
a
ditch
just
outside
of
town
shot
through
the
head
his
pockets
rifled
it
is
known
that
he
started
to
town
to
deposit
four
hundred
dollars
in
the
bank
the
money
is
missing
and
so
are
his
horse
and
buggy
a
young
fellow
was
seen
in
the
neighbourhood
early
this
morning
a
stranger
the
chief
description
corresponds
with
the
man
who
sold
that
rig
to
you
the
murderer
is
known
to
have
driven
in
this
direction
people
saw
him
going
almost
at
a
gallop
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
that
tinkletown
thoroughly
turned
inside
out
with
excitement
the
whole
population
was
soon
at
the
and
everybody
was
trying
to
supply
anderson
crow
with
wits
he
had
lost
his
own
we
got
to
catch
that
fellow
finally
resolved
the
marshal
there
was
a
dead
silence
he
got
a
pistol
ventured
some
one
how
do
you
know
demanded
crow
keenly
did
y
see
it
he
could
ha
killed
that
feller
a
gun
that
a
fact
agreed
anderson
crow
well
we
got
to
get
him
anyhow
i
call
for
volunteers
who
will
join
me
in
the
search
cried
the
marshal
bravely
i
hate
to
go
to
crow
cliff
after
him
said
george
ray
it
a
lonesome
place
and
as
dark
as
night
them
trees
and
rocks
it
our
duty
to
catch
him
he
a
criminal
and
besides
he
killed
a
man
said
crow
severely
and
he
has
dollars
of
your
money
added
harry
squires
i
go
with
you
anderson
i
got
a
revolver
look
out
there
roared
anderson
crow
the
blamed
thing
might
go
off
he
added
as
the
reporter
drew
a
shiny
from
his
pocket
the
example
set
by
one
brave
man
had
its
influence
on
the
crowd
a
score
or
more
volunteered
despite
the
objections
of
their
wives
and
it
was
not
long
before
anderson
crow
was
leading
his
motley
band
of
sleuths
down
the
lane
to
the
over
which
the
desperado
had
gone
an
hour
before
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
that
various
citizens
recalled
certain
actions
and
certain
characteristics
of
the
stranger
which
had
made
them
suspicious
from
the
start
his
prodigal
disposition
of
the
box
of
matches
impressed
most
of
them
as
reckless
his
haste
anxiety
and
a
single
instance
of
mild
profanity
told
others
of
his
viciousness
one
man
was
sure
he
had
seen
the
stranger
watch
chain
in
farmer
grover
possession
and
another
saw
something
black
on
his
thumb
which
he
now
remembered
was
a
powder
stain
i
noticed
all
them
things
averred
anderson
crow
supreme
once
more
but
what
in
thunder
did
he
want
with
those
inquired
george
ray
never
mind
said
anderson
mysteriously
you
find
out
soon
enough
do
you
know
anderson
some
one
asked
of
course
i
do
responded
the
marshal
loftily
well
what
were
they
for
then
i
not
givin
any
clews
away
you
just
wait
a
while
and
see
if
i
not
right
and
they
were
satisfied
that
the
detective
knew
all
about
it
after
crossing
the
the
party
was
divided
as
to
which
direction
it
should
take
the
marshal
said
the
man
had
run
to
the
southeast
but
for
some
inexplicable
reason
quite
a
number
of
the
pursuers
wanted
to
hunt
for
him
in
the
northwest
finally
it
was
decided
to
separate
into
posses
of
ten
all
to
converge
at
crow
cliff
as
soon
as
possible
there
were
enough
shotguns
in
the
party
to
have
conquered
a
pirate
crew
at
the
end
of
an
hour
anderson
crow
and
his
delegation
came
to
the
narrow
path
which
led
to
the
summit
of
crow
cliff
they
were
very
brave
by
this
time
a
small
boy
was
telling
them
he
had
seen
the
fugitive
about
right
where
you
fellers
are
standin
now
did
he
have
any
blood

tole
him

bottom

cliff

the
boy
what

yelled
at
me
after

the
boy
paused
irresolutely
asked
what

roll
of
bills
as
big
as
my
leg
everybody
gasped
and
thought
of
grover

to
the
river
with
him
interrogated
the
reporter
i
went
as
fur
as
the
clearin
an
then
he
tole
me
to
stop
he
said
he
could
find
the
way
from
there
after
that
he
run
up
the
bank
as
if
some
one
was
after
him
there
was
a
boat
waitin
fer
him
under
the
clift
did
he
get
into
it
cried
squires
he
tole
me
not
to
look
or
he
break
my
neck
said
the
boy
the
posse
nervously
fingered
its
arsenal
but
you
look
yep
i
seen
plain
them
was
there
more
than
one
there
was
a
woman
in
the
skift
you
do
say
so
gasped
squires
dang
it
ai
he
tellin
you
anderson
ejaculated
scornfully
the
boy
was
hurried
off
at
the
head
of
the
posse
which
by
this
time
had
been
reinforced
he
led
the
way
through
the
dismal
thickets
telling
his
story
as
he
went
she
was
mighty
purty
too
he
said
the
feller
waved
his
hat
when
he
seen
her
an
she
waved
back
he
run
down
an
jumped
in
the
boat
then
what
exploded
anderson
crow
he
kissed
her
the
d
murderer
roared
crow
he
grabbed
up
the
oars
and
rowed
an
downstream
an
he
shuck
his
fist
at
me
when
he
see
i
been
watchin
said
the
youngster
ready
to
whimper
now
that
he
realised
what
a
desperate
character
he
had
been
dealing
with
where
did
he
land
on
the
other
side
pursued
the
eager
reporter
down
by
them
willer
trees
half
a
mile
down
there
the
skift
tied
to
a
saplin
cai
you
see
it
sure
enough
the
stern
of
a
small
boat
stuck
out
into
the
deep
broad
river
the
bow
being
hidden
by
the
bushes
both
of
hurried
up
the
hill
over
yender
an
that
the
last
i
seen
of
concluded
the
lad
anderson
crow
and
his
stared
helplessly
at
the
broad
swift
river
and
then
looked
at
each
other
in
despair
there
was
no
boat
in
sight
except
the
murderer
and
there
was
no
bridge
within
ten
miles
while
they
were
growling
a
belated
detachment
of
hunters
came
up
to
the
river
bank
greatly
agitated
a
telephone
message
has
just
come
to
town
sayin
there
would
be
a
thousand
dollars
reward
announced
one
of
the
late
arrivals
and
instantly
there
was
an
imperative
demand
for
boats
there
an
old
raft
upstream
said
the
boy
but
i
do
know
how
many
it
will
kerry
they
use
it
to
pole
corn
over
from
knoblock
farm
to
them
big
summer
places
in
the
hills
up
yender
is
it
sound
demanded
anderson
crow
must
be
or
they
would
use
it
said
squires
sarcastically
where
is
it
kid
the
boy
led
the
way
up
the
river
bank
the
whole
company
trailing
behind
sh
not
too
loud
cautioned
anderson
crow
fifteen
minutes
later
a
wobbly
craft
put
out
to
sea
manned
by
a
picked
crew
of
determined
citizens
of
tinkletown
when
they
were
in
midstream
a
loud
cry
came
from
the
bank
they
had
left
behind
looking
back
anderson
crow
saw
excited
men
dashing
about
most
of
them
pointing
excitedly
up
into
the
hills
across
the
river
after
a
diligent
search
the
eyes
of
the
men
on
the
raft
saw
what
it
was
that
had
created
such
a
stir
at
the
base
of
cliff
there
he
is
cried
anderson
crow
in
awed
tones
there
was
no
mistaking
the
identity
of
the
coatless
man
on
the
hillside
a
dozen
men
recognised
him
as
the
man
they
were
after
putting
his
hands
to
his
mouth
anderson
crow
bellowed
in
tones
that
savoured
more
of
fright
than
command
say
there
was
no
response
will
you
surrender
peaceably
called
the
captain
of
the
craft
there
was
a
moment
of
indecision
on
the
part
of
the
fugitive
he
looked
at
his
companion
and
she
shook
her
head
they
all
saw
her
do
it
then
he
shouted
back
his
reply
illustration
then
he
shouted
back
his
reply
chapter
iii
the
culprits
ship
ahoy
shouted
the
coatless
stranger
between
his
palms
surrender
or
we
fill
you
full
of
lead
called
anderson
crow
who
are
you
pirates
responded
the
fugitive
with
a
laugh
that
chilled
the
marrow
of
the
men
on
the
raft
i
show
you
who
we
are
bellowed
anderson
crow
send
her
ashore
boys
fast
the
derned
scamp
escape
us
dead
er
alive
we
must
have
him
as
they
poled
toward
the
bank
the
woman
grasped
the
man
by
the
arm
dragging
him
back
among
the
trees
it
was
observed
by
all
that
she
was
greatly
terrified
moreover
she
was
exceedingly
fair
to
look
upon
young
beautiful
and
a
most
incongruous
companion
for
the
bloody
rascal
who
had
her
in
his
power
the
raft
bumped
against
the
reedy
bank
and
anderson
crow
was
the
first
man
ashore
come
on
boys
follow
me
see
that
your
guns
are
all
right
straight
up
the
hill
now
an
spread
out
a
bit
so
we
can
surround
him
commanded
he
in
a
high
treble
supposin
he
surrounds
us
panted
a
cautious
pursuer
half
way
up
the
hill
that
what
we
got
to
guard
against
retorted
anderson
crow
the
posse
bravely
swept
up
to
and
across
the
greensward
but
the
fox
was
gone
there
was
no
sight
or
sound
of
him
to
be
had
it
is
but
just
to
say
that
fatigue
was
responsible
for
the
deep
breath
that
came
from
each
member
of
the
pursuing
party
into
the
woods
after
him
shouted
anderson
crow
hunt
him
down
like
a
rat
in
the
meantime
a
coatless
young
man
and
a
most
enticing
young
woman
were
scampering
off
among
the
oaks
and
underbrush
consumed
by
excitement
and
no
small
degree
of
apprehension
they
really
seem
to
be
in
earnest
about
it
jack
urged
the
young
woman
insistently
to
offset
his
somewhat
sarcastic
comments
how
the
dickens
do
you
suppose

got
onto
me
he
groaned
i
thought
the
tracks
were
beautifully
covered
no
one
suspected
sure
i
told
you
dear
how
it
would
turn
out
she
cried
in
a
voice
good
heavens
marjory
do
turn
against
me
it
all
seemed
so
easy
and
so
sure
dear
there
was
a
breath
of
suspicion
what
are
we
to
do
i
stop
and
fight
the
whole
bunch
if
you
just
let
go
my
arm
no
you
wo
jack
barnes
she
exclaimed
resolutely
her
pretty
blue
eyes
wide
with
alarm
did
you
hear
them
say
they
fill
you
full
of
lead
they
had
guns
and
everything
oh
dear
oh
dear
is
it
horrid
the
worst
of
it
is
they
cut
us
off
from
the
river
he
said
miserably
if
i
could
have
reached
the
boat
ahead
of
them
they
never
could
have
caught
us
i
could
distance
that
old
raft
in
a
mile
i
know
you
could
dear
she
cried
looking
with
frantic
admiration
upon
his
broad
shoulders
and
brawny
bare
arms
but
it
is
out
of
the
question
now
never
mind
sweetheart
do
let
it
fuss
you
so
it
will
turn
out
all
right
i
know
it
will
oh
i
ca
run
any
farther
she
gasped
despairingly
poor
little
chap
let
me
carry
you
you
big
ninny
we
are
at
least
three
miles
from
your
house
dear
and
surrounded
by
deadly
perils
can
you
climb
a
tree
i
can
but
i
wo
she
refused
flatly
her
cheeks
very
red
then
i
fancy
we
have
to
keep
on
in
this
manner
it
a
confounded
shame
the
whole
business
just
as
i
thought
everything
was
going
so
smoothly
too
it
was
all
arranged
to
a
queen
taste
nothing
was
left
undone
bracken
was
to
meet
us
at
his
uncle
boathouse
down
there
and
good
heavens
there
was
a
shot
the
sharp
crack
of
a
rifle
broke
upon
the
still
balmy
air
as
they
say
in
the
and
the
fugitives
looked
at
each
other
with
suddenly
awakened
dread
the
fools
grated
the
man
what
do
they
mean
cried
the
breathless
girl
very
white
in
the
face
they
are
trying
to
frighten
us
that
all
hang
it
if
i
only
knew
the
lay
of
the
land
i
completely
lost
marjory
do
you
know
precisely
where
we
are
our
home
is
off
to
the
north
about
three
miles
we
are
almost
opposite
crow
cliff
the
wildest
part
of
the
country
there
are
no
houses
along
this
part
of
the
river
all
of
the
summer
houses
are
farther
up
or
on
the
other
side
it
is
too
hilly
here
there
is
a
railroad
off
there
about
six
miles
there
is
a
boathouse
or
fisherman
hut
nearer
than
two
miles
bracken
keeps
his
boat
at
the
point
two
miles
south
at
least
yes
that
where
we
were
to
have
gone
by
boat
hang
it
all
why
did
we
ever
leave
the
boat
you
can
never
scramble
through
all
this
brush
to
bracken
place
it
all
i
can
do
look
at
my
arms
they
are
scratched
to
oh
dear
it
dreadful
jack
you
poor
fellow
let
me
we
have
time
dearest
by
thunder
i
would
have
those
rubes
head
us
off
now
for
the
whole
county
the
jays
how
could
they
have
found
us
out
some
one
must
have
told
but
no
one
knew
except
the
brackens
you
and
i
i
wager
my
head
bracken
is
saying
hard
things
for
fair
down
the
river
there
he
he
does
swear
jack
she
panted
illustration
for
a
minute
or
two
at
least
he
whispered
why
you
are
ready
to
drop
ca
you
go
a
step
farther
let
stop
here
and
face
i
bluff
out
and
we
get
to
bracken
some
way
but
i
give
up
the
game
not
for
a
million
then
we
ca
stop
you
forget
i
go
in
for
gymnasium
work
i
as
strong
as
anything
only
i
i
a
bit
nervous
oh
i
knew
something
would
go
wrong
she
wailed
they
were
now
standing
like
trapped
deer
in
a
little
thicket
listening
for
sounds
of
the
hounds
are
you
sorry
dear
no
no
i
love
you
jack
and
i
go
through
everything
with
you
and
for
you
really
she
cried
with
a
fine
show
of
enthusiasm
this
is
jolly
good
fun
is
it
being
chased
like
regular
bandits
sh
drop
down
dear
there
somebody
passing
above
us
hear
him
they
crawled
into
a
maze
of
hazel
bushes
with
much
less
dignity
than
haste
two
men
sped
by
an
instant
later
panting
and
growling
safe
for
a
minute
or
two
at
least
he
whispered
as
the
crunching
footsteps
were
lost
to
the
ear
they
wo
come
back
this
way
dear
they
had
guns
jack
she
whispered
terrified
i
do
understand
it
hanged
if
i
do
he
said
pulling
his
brows
into
a
mighty
scowl
they
are
after
us
like
a
pack
of
hounds
it
must
mean
something
lord
but
we
seem
to
have
stirred
up
a
hornet
nest
oh
dear
i
wish
we
were
safely
at
she
paused
at
home
he
asked
quickly
at
bracken
she
finished
and
if
any
of
the
pursuers
had
been
near
enough
he
might
have
heard
the
unmistakable
suggestion
of
a
kiss
i
feel
better
he
said
squaring
his
shoulders
now
let
me
think
we
must
outwit
these
fellows
whoever
they
are
by
george
i
remember
one
of
them
that
old
fellow
who
bought
the
horse
is
with
them
that
it
the
horse
is
mixed
up
in
this
i
bet
my
head
they
sat
upon
the
ground
for
several
minutes
he
thinking
deeply
she
listening
with
her
pretty
ears
intent
i
wonder
if
they
left
anybody
to
guard
our
boat
he
said
suddenly
come
on
marjory
let
investigate
by
george
it
would
be
just
like
them
to
leave
it
unprotected
once
more
they
were
moving
cautiously
through
the
brush
headed
for
the
river
jack
barnes
whoever
he
was
and
whatever
his
crime
was
a
resourceful
clever
young
man
he
had
gauged
the
intelligence
of
the
pursuers
correctly
when
he
peered
through
the
brush
along
the
river
bank
he
saw
the
skiff
in
the
reeds
below
just
as
they
had
left
it
there
was
the
lunch
basket
the
wee
bit
of
a
steamer
trunk
with
all
its
labels
a
parasol
and
a
small
handbag
goody
goody
marjory
cried
like
a
happy
child
do
show
yourself
yet
dearie
i
make
sure
they
may
have
an
ambuscade
wait
here
for
me
he
crept
down
the
bank
and
back
again
before
she
could
fully
subdue
the
tremendous
thumping
his
temerity
had
started
in
her
left
side
it
safe
and
sound
he
whispered
joyously
the
idiots
have
forgotten
the
boat
quick
dear
let
make
a
dash
for
it
their
raft
is
upstream
a
hundred
yards
and
it
is
also
deserted
if
we
can
once
get
well
across
the
river
we
can
give
them
the
laugh
but
they
may
shoot
us
from
the
bank
she
protested
as
they
plunged
through
the
weeds
they
surely
would
shoot
a
woman
he
cried
gayly
but
you
are
not
a
woman
and
i
not
afraid
of
mice
or
men
jump
in
off
from
the
weeds
shot
the
light
skiff
the
water
splashed
for
a
moment
under
the
spasmodic
strokes
of
the
oarsman
and
then
the
little
boat
streaked
out
into
the
river
like
a
thing
of
life
marjory
sat
in
the
stern
and
kept
her
eyes
upon
the
bank
they
were
leaving
jack
barnes
drove
every
vestige
of
his
strength
into
the
stroke
somehow
he
pulled
like
a
man
who
had
learned
how
on
a
college
crew
they
were
half
way
across
the
broad
river
before
they
were
seen
from
the
hills
the
half
dozen
men
who
lingered
at
the
base
of
crow
cliff
had
shouted
the
alarm
to
their
friends
on
the
other
side
and
the
fugitives
were
sighted
once
more
but
it
was
too
late
the
boat
was
well
out
of
gunshot
range
and
making
rapid
progress
downstream
in
the
shelter
of
the
high
bluffs
below
crow
cliff
jack
barnes
was
dripping
with
perspiration
but
his
stroke
was
none
the
feebler
they
see
us
she
cried
do
wriggle
so
marjory
trim
boat
he
panted
they
ca
hit
us
and
we
can
go
two
miles
to
their
one
and
we
can
get
to
bracken
she
cried
triumphantly
a
deep
flush
overspread
her
pretty
face
hooray
he
shouted
with
a
grin
of
pure
delight
far
away
on
the
opposite
bank
anderson
crow
and
his
sleuths
were
congregating
their
baffled
gaze
upon
the
man
who
had
slipped
out
of
their
grasp
the
men
of
the
posse
were
pointing
at
the
boat
and
arguing
frantically
there
were
decided
signs
of
dispute
among
them
finally
two
guns
flew
up
and
then
came
the
puffs
of
smoke
the
reports
and
little
splashes
of
water
near
the
flying
skiff
oh
they
are
shooting
she
cried
in
a
panic
and
rifles
too
he
grated
redoubling
his
pull
on
the
oars
other
shots
followed
all
falling
short
get
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
marjory
do
sit
up
there
and
be
i
sit
right
where
i
am
she
cried
defiantly
anderson
crow
waved
to
the
men
under
crow
cliff
and
they
began
to
make
their
arduous
way
along
the
bank
in
the
trail
of
the
skiff
part
of
the
armed
posse
hurried
down
and
boarded
the
raft
while
others
followed
the
chase
by
land
we
beat
them
to
bracken
by
a
mile
cried
jack
barnes
if
they
do
shoot
us
she
responded
why
oh
why
are
they
so
intent
upon
killing
us
they
do
want
you
to
be
a
widow
and
break
a
lot
of
hearts
he
said
if
they
hit
me
now
you
wo
be
dangerous
as
a
widow
oh
you
heartless
thing
how
can
you
jest
about
it
i
i
go
into
mourning
anyway
jack
she
concluded
on
second
thought
we
are
just
as
good
as
married
you
see
it
nice
of
you
to
say
it
dear
but
we
a
long
way
from
bracken
gee
that
was
close
a
bullet
splashed
in
the
water
not
ten
feet
from
the
boat
the
cowards
they
actually
trying
to
kill
us
for
the
first
time
his
face
took
on
a
look
of
alarm
and
his
eyes
grew
desperate
i
ca
let
them
shoot
at
you
marjory
dear
what
the
dickens
they
want
i
do
know
but
going
to
surrender
he
had
stopped
rowing
and
was
making
ready
to
wave
his
white
handkerchief
on
high
never
she
cried
with
blazing
eyes
give
me
the
oars
she
slid
into
the
other
rowing
seat
and
tried
to
snatch
the
oars
from
the
rowlocks
bravo
i
could
kiss
you
a
thousand
times
for
that
come
on
you
indians
you
a
darling
marjory
again
the
oars
caught
the
water
and
jack
barnes
white
handkerchief
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
he
was
rowing
for
dear
life
and
there
was
a
smile
on
his
face
the
raft
was
left
far
behind
and
the
marksmen
were
put
out
of
range
with
surprising
ease
fifteen
minutes
later
the
skiff
shot
across
the
river
and
up
to
the
landing
of
bracken
boathouse
while
a
mile
back
in
the
brush
anderson
crow
and
his
men
were
wrathfully
scrambling
in
pursuit
hey
bracken
jimmy
shouted
jack
barnes
jumping
out
upon
the
little
wharf
marjory
gave
him
her
hands
and
was
whisked
ashore
and
into
his
arms
run
into
the
boathouse

yank
this
stuff
ashore
where
the
dickens

the
boathouse

sleepy
young

shot
at

marjory
running

arms
of

young

a
jiffy
the
fugitives
and
their
property
were
transferred
to
the
interior
of
the
roomy
boathouse
the
doors
bolted
and
george
crosby
stationed
at
a
window
to
act
as
lookout
is
it
your
father
demanded
the
rev
james
bracken
turning
to
marjory
young
crosby
was
looking
on
eagerly
brewster
is
at
home
and
totally
oblivious
to
all
this
cried
jack
barnes
i
do
know
what
it
means
here
the
license

are
you
ready
marjory
this
is
rather
a
squeamish
business
jack
began
the
young
minister
in
the
negligée
shirt
he
was
pulling
on
his
coat
as
he
made
the
remark
oh
hurry
jimmy
please

cried
marjory
brewster
do
wait
a
second
jimmy
bracken
cried
amy
crosby
dancing
with
excitement
you
ca
go
back
on
them
now
three
minutes
later
there
was
no
marjory
brewster
but
there
was
a
john
ethelbert
barnes
and
she
was
kissing
her
husband
rapturously
now
tell
us
everything
cried
crosby
after
the
frantic
congratulations
the
reverend
jimmy
bracken
of
the
eleventh
presbyterian
church
was
the
only
one
who
seemed
uncertain
as
to
his
position
in
the
first
place
old
judge
brewster
was
a
man
of
influence
in
the
metropolis
from
which
all
had
fled
for
a
sojourn
in
the
hills
he
and
his
daughter
were
episcopalians
but
that
made
them
none
the
less
important
in
the
eyes
of
jimmy
bracken
in
the
second
place
jack
barnes
was
a
struggling
lawyer
in
the
year
of
our
lord
and
possessed
of
objectionable
poverty
the
young
men
had
been
at
college
friendship
had
overcome
discretion
in
this
instance
at
least
the
deed
being
done
young
bracken
was
beginning
to
wonder
if
it
had
not
been
overdone
so
to
speak
i
wish
somebody
would
tell
me
exclaimed
jack
barnes
with
a
perplexed
frown
the
beastly
jays
shot
at
us
and
all
that
you
think
i
was
an
outlaw
and
they
blazed
away
at
marjory
too
hang
them
marjory
too
excited
to
act
like
a
blushing
bride
took
up
the
story
and
told
all
that
had
happened
george
crosby
became
so
interested
that
he
forgot
to
keep
guard
this
is
a
funny
mess
he
exclaimed
there
something
wrong
hey
you
came
a
shout
from
the
outside
there
they
are
cried
marjory
flying
to
her
husband
side
what

mean
what

they
to

and
they
ca
get

cried
the
groom
exultantly
you
regret
it
do
you
sweetheart
quite
anxiously
she
smiled
up
into
his
eyes
and
he
felt
very
secure
what
do
you
fellows
want
demanded
crosby
from
the
window
anderson
crow
was
standing
on
the
river
bank
like
a
true
napoleon
flanked
by
three
trusty
riflemen
who
air

asked
anderson
in
return
he
was
panting
heavily
and
his
legs
trembled

grounds

crosby
defiantly
the
inmates
gasped

hear
that
exclaimed
jack
barnes
let
me
get
at
the
old
rat
he
was
making
for
the
door
when
the
two
women
obstructed
the
way
both
were
frantic
with
fear
but
he
called
you
a
female
roared
he
well
i
she
wailed
miserably
who
is
it
you
want
asked
crosby
from
the
window
that
all
right
roared
anderson
crow
purduce
him
at
once
is
this
the
fellow
and
crosby
dragged
the
reverend
jimmy
into
view
there
was
a
moment
inspection
of
the
cadaverous
face
and
then
the
sleuths
shook
their
heads
not
on
your
life
said
crow
but
he
in
there
ike
smalley
seen
him
an
his
paramount
go
up
the
steps
from
the
landin
do
no
good
to
hide
him
young
feller

well
let
me
tell
you

too
late

cried
crosby
triumphantly
i
do

cuss
if

and

sixteen
children
shouted
the
exasperated
crow
his
badge
fairly
dancing
he
got
to
surrender
oh
he
does
eh
yes
he
got
to
give
up
dead
or
alive
trot
him
out
lively
now
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
barnes
is
here
but
i
like
to
know
why
you
hunting
him
down
like
a
wild
beast
shooting
at
him
and
miss
i
mean
barnes
it
an
outrage
oh

ai
the
people

slaughter
she
just
as
bad
as
he
is
for
that
matter
an
so
are
you
and
that
other
outlaw
in
there
the
reverend
jimmy
gasped
and
turned
a
fiery
red
did
he
call
me
a
say
and
he
pushed
crosby
aside
i
have
you
to
understand
that
i
a
minister
of
the
gospel
i
am
the
reverend
james
bracken
of
a
roar
of
laughter
greeted
his
attempt
to
explain
and
there
were
a
few
remarks
so
uncomplimentary
that
the
man
of
cloth
sank
back
in
sheer
hopelessness
well
i
give
them
reason
to
think
that
i
something
of
a
desperado
grated
the
reverend
jimmy
squaring
his
shoulders
if
they
attempt
to
put
foot
inside
my
uncle
house
i
i
smash
a
few
heads
bravo
cried
crosby
she
was
his
cousin
and
up
to
that
time
had
had
small
regard
for
her
relative
he
can
preach
the
funeral
shouted
ike
smalley
by
this
time
there
were
a
dozen
men
on
the
bank
below
i
give
you
fair
warning
cried
anderson
crow
impressively
goin
to
surround
the
house
an
we
take
that
rascal
if
we
have
to
shoot
the
boards
into
sawdust
but
what
has
he
done
except
to
get
married
called
crosby
as
the
posse
began
to
spread
out
do
you
i
fool
enough
to
tell
you
if
you
do
know
said
anderson
crow
just
as
like
as
not
you
be
claimin
the
thousand
dollars
reward
if
you
knowed
it
had
been
offered
spread
out
boys
we
show
dern
quick
there
was
dead
silence
inside
the
house
for
a
full
minute
every
eye
was
wide
and
every
mouth
was
open
in
surprise
and
consternation
a
thousand
dollars
reward
gasped
jack
barnes
then
good
lord
i
have
done
something
what
you
been
doing
jack
barnes
cried
his
bride
aghast
i
must
have
robbed
a
train
said
he
dejectedly
well
this
is
serious
after
all
said
crosby
it
not
an
eloper
they
after
but
a
desperado
a
kidnaper
perhaps
suggested
his
wife
what
are
we
to
do
demanded
jack
barnes
first
old
man
what
have
you
actually
done
asked
the
reverend
jimmy
nothing
that
worth
a
thousand
dollars
i
dead
sure
said
barnes
positively
by
george
marjory
this
is
a
nice
mess
i
led
you
into
it
all
right
jack
i
happier
than
i
ever
was
before
in
my
life
we
ran
away
to
get
married
and
i
go
to
jail
with
you
if
they
take
me
this
is
no
time
for
kissing
objected
crosby
sourly
we
must
find
out
what
it
all
means
leave
it
to
me
it
was
getting
dark
in
the
room
and
the
shadows
were
heavy
on
the
hills
while
the
remaining
members
of
the
besieged
party
sat
silent
and
depressed
upon
the
casks
and
boxes
crosby
stood
at
the
window
calling
to
the
enemy
is
he
ready
to
surrender
thundered
anderson
crow
from
the
shadows
then
followed
a
brief
and
entirely
unsatisfactory
dialogue
between
the
two
spokesmen
anderson
crow
was
firm
in
his
decision
that
the
fugitive
did
not
have
to
be
told
what
he
had
done
and
george
crosby
was
equally
insistent
that
he
had
to
be
told
before
he
could
decide
whether
he
was
guilty
or
innocent
we
starve
him
out
said
anderson
crow
but
there
are
ladies
here
my
good
man
you
wo
subject
them
to
such
treatment
you
all
of
a
kind
we
going
to
take
the
whole
bunch
what
do
you
think
will
happen
to
you
if
you
are
mistaken
in
your
man
we
not
mistaken
dang
ye
he
could
sue
you
for
every
dollar
you
possess
i
know
for
i
a
lawyer
now
i
sure
you
in
the
job
with
him
i
you
try
to
work
in
the
insanity
dodge
it
a
nest
of
thieves
and
robbers
say
give
you
five
minutes
to
surrender
if
you
do
we
set
fire
to
the
derned
shanty
look
here
boys
said
jack
barnes
suddenly
i
done
nothing
and
am
not
afraid
to
be
arrested
i
going
to
give
myself
up
of
course
there
was
a
storm
of
protest
and
a
flow
of
tears
but
the
culprit
was
firm
tell
the
old
fossil
that
if
he
guarantee
safety
to
me
i
give
up
anderson
was
almost
too
quick
in
promising
protection
ask
him
if
he
will
surrender
and
make
a
confession
to
me
i
am
anderson
crow
sir
was
the
marshal
tactful
suggestion
he
do
both
mr
crow
replied
crosby
we
got
to
take
the
whole
bunch
of
you
young
man
you
all
guilty
of
conspiracy
the
whole
caboodle
but
the
ladies

rube

ca
looky
here
young
feller
you
ca
dictate
to
me
i
have
you
to
we
all
go
cried
crosby
warmly
to
the
very
end
added
the
new
barnes
what
will
your
father
say
demanded
the
groom
he
disown
me
anyway
dear
so
what
the
difference
it
rather
annoying
for
a
minister
began
the
reverend
jimmy
putting
on
his
hat
we
beg
off
for
you
cried
crosby
ironically
but
i
going
to
jail
too
finished
he
grimly
all
right
called
crosby
from
the
window
here
we
come
and
forth
marched
the
desperate
quintet
three
strapping
young
men
and
two
very
pretty
and
nervous
young
women
they
were
met
by
anderson
crow
and
a
dozen
armed
men
from
tinkletown
every
one
of
them
shaking
in
his
boots
the
irrepressible
crosby
said
boo
suddenly
and
half
the
posse
jumped
as
though
some
one
had
thrown
a
bomb
at
them
now
i
demand
an
explanation
of
this
outrage
said
jack
barnes
savagely
what
do
you
mean
by
shooting
at
me
and
my
my
wife
and
arresting
us
and
all
that
you
find
out

enough
when

barnes
as
the
herd
of

off
toward
the
string
of
boats

to

i
bet
my
soul
that

some
one
with

news
cried
george
crosby
who
had
heard
nothing
of
the
tragedy
until
this
instant
a
rowboat
containing
three
men
was
making
for
the
landing
somehow
anderson
crow
and
his
posse
felt
the
ground
sinking
beneath
them
not
a
man
uttered
a
sound
until
one
of
the
newcomers
called
out
from
the
boat
is
anderson
crow
there

voice

time

about

an
hour
after

sputtered
the
marshal
an

hasty
lot
an
began
one
of
the
newcomers
sheepishly
well
i
be
gasped
anderson
crow
sitting
down
suddenly
an
hour
and
a
half
later
and
john
ethelbert
barnes
were
driven
up
to
judge
brewster
country
place
in
david
bracken
brake
they
were
accompanied
by
and
george
crosby
and
were
carrying
out
the
plans
as
outlined
in
the
original
programme
where
papa
marjory
tremulously
inquired
of
the
footman
in
the
hallway
he
waitin
for
you
in
the
library
miss
i
should
say
barnes
replied
the
man
a
trace
of
excitement
in
his
face
mrs
barnes
exclaimed
four
voices
at
once
who
told
you
william
cried
marjory
leaning
upon
jack
for
support
a
anderson
crow
was
here
not
half
an
hour
ago
to
assure
brewster
as
to
how
his
new
was
in
nowise
connected
with
the
murder
up
the
way
he
said
as
how
he
had
personally
investigated
the
case
miss
and
brewster
could
rely
on
his
word
for
it
jack
was
not
the
man
he
told
him
as
how
you
was
married
at
the
boathouse
yes
and
then
cried
marjory
eagerly
brewster
said
that
jack
was
born
to
be
hanged
and
for
me
to
have
an
extry
plate
laid
at
the
table
for
him
concluded
william
with
an
expressive
grin
chapter
v
the
babe
on
the
doorstep
it
was
midnight
in
tinkletown
many
months
after
the
events
mentioned
in
the
foregoing
chapters
and
a
blizzard
was
raging
the
february
wind
rasped
through
the
bare
trees
shrieked
around
the
corners
of
lightless
houses
and
whipped
its
way
through
the
scurrying
snow
with
all
the
rage
of
a
lion
the
snow
on
account
of
the
bitter
cold
in
the
air
did
not
fly
in
big
flakes
but
whizzed
like
tiny
bullets
cutting
the
flesh
of
men
and
beasts
like
the
sting
of
wasps
it
was
a
good
night
to
be
indoors
over
a
roaring
fire
or
in
bed
between
extra
blankets
no
one
unless
commanded
by
emergency
had
the
temerity
to
be
abroad
that
night
the
crow
family
snoozed
comfortably
in
spite
of
the
calliope
shrieks
of
the
wind
the
home
of
the
town
marshal
was
blanketed
in
peace
and
the
wind
had
no
terrors
for
its
occupants
they
slept
the
sleep
of
the
toasted
the
windows
may
have
rattled
a
bit
perhaps
and
the
shutters
may
have
banged
a
trifle
too
remorselessly
but
the
crows
were
not
to
be
disturbed
the
big
clock
in
the
hall
downstairs
was
striking
twelve
when
anderson
crow
awoke
with
a
start
he
was
amazed
for
to
awake
in
the
middle
of
the
night
was
an
proceeding
for
him
he
caught
the
clang
of
the
last
five
strokes
from
the
clock
however
and
was
comforting
himself
with
the
belief
that
it
was
five
after
all
when
his
wife
stirred
nervously
are
you
awake
anderson
she
asked
softly
yes
eva
and
it
about
time
to
get
up
it
jest
struck
five

strokes

i
did
myself
ai
it
queer

this
unearthly
hour

murmured
he
sleepily
now
that
it
was
not
five
it
a
mighty
good
hour
to
go
back
to
sleep
i
reckon
i
thought
i
heard
a
noise
outside
she
persisted
i
do
blame
you
he
said
chuckling
it
been
out
there
all
night
i
mean
something
besides
the
wind

like

on
the
front
porch

crow
the
most
man
in
the
world
crawled
shiveringly
but
quickly
from
the
warm
bed
in
his
stocking
feet
anderson
slept
in
his
socks
on
those
bitter
nights
he
made
his
way
down
the
front
stairs
grumbling
but
determined
crow
followed
close
behind
anxious
to
verify
the
claim
that
routed
him
from
his
nest
it
may
be
a
robber
she
chattered
as
he
pulled
aside
a
front
window
curtain
anderson
drew
back
hastily
well
why
in
thunder
did
you
say
so
before
he
gasped
doggone
eva
that
no
way
to
do
he
might
fired
through
the
winder
at
me
but
he
in
the
house
by
this
time
if
it
was
a
robber
she
whispered
he
would
stand
out
on
the
porch
all
night
that
right
he
whispered
in
reply
you
a
good
deducer
after
all
i
wish
i
had
my
dark
lantern
thunderation
he
stubbed
his
toe
against
the
sewing
machine
there
is
nothing
that
hurts
more
than
unintentional
contact
with
a
sewing
machine
why
in
sixty
do
you
light
a
light
eva
how
can
i
listen
she
whispered
shrilly

and
she
grabbed
the
back
of
his
nightshirt
as
he
started
for
the
stairs
sho
what
air
you
afeerd
of
i
get
my
revolver
too
i
never
did
see
such
a
calf
as
just
then
there
was
a
tremendous
pounding
on
the
front
door
followed
by
the
creaking
of
footsteps
on
the
frozen
porch
a
clatter
down
the
steps
and
then
the
same
old
howling
of
the
wind
the
crows
jumped
almost
out
of
their
scanty
garments
and
then
settled
down
as
if
frozen
to
the
spot
it
was
a
full
minute
before
anderson
found
his
voice
in
advance
of
crow
at
that
which
was
more
than
marvellous
what
was
that
he
chattered
a
knock
she
gasped
some
neighbour

anderson
see
what
it
is
and
so
after
much
urging
anderson
crow
unbolted
his
front
door
and
turned
the
knob
the
wind
did
the
rest
it
almost
blew
the
door
off
its
hinges
carrying
and
crow
back
against
the
wall
a
gale
of
snow
swept
over
them
gee
gasped
anderson
crimping
his
toes
crow
was
peering
under
his
arm
look
there
she
cried
close
to
the
door
a
large
bundle
was
lying
a
present
from
some
one
speculated
crow
but
some
seconds
passed
before
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
funny
time
fer
santy
to
be
wonder
if
he
thinks
it
next
christmas
be
careful
anderson
mebby
it
an
infernal
machine
cried
his
wife
well

loaded
ginger

grunted
as
straightened
up
in
the
face
of
the
gale

the
door

door

door

her
husband

clothes
baskit
what
in
thunder
do
let
get
a
light
out
by
the
kitchen
fire
it
too
cold
in
here
together
they
sped
to
the
kitchen
with
the
mysterious
offering
from
the
blizzard
there
was
a
fire
in
the
stove
which
anderson
replenished
while
eva
began
to
remove
the
blankets
and
packing
from
the
basket
which
she
had
placed
on
the
hearth
anderson
looked
on
eagerly
lord
fell
from
the
lips
of
both
as
the
contents
of
the
basket
were
exposed
to
their
gaze
a
baby
alive
and
warm
lay
packed
in
the
blankets
sound
asleep
and
happy
for
an
interminable
length
of
time
the
crows
stood
and
gazed
and
awed
at
the
little
stranger
ten
minutes
later
after
the
ejaculations
and
surmises
after
the
tears
and
expletives
after
the
whole
house
had
been
aroused
anderson
crow
was
plunging
amiably
but
aimlessly
through
the
snowstorm
in
search
of
the
heartless
wretch
who
had
deposited
the
infant
on
his
doorstep
his
top
boots
scuttled
up
and
down
the
street
through
yards
and
barn
lots
for
an
hour
but
despite
the
fact
that
he
carried
his
dark
lantern
and
trailed
like
an
indian
bloodhound
he
found
no
trace
of
the
wanton
visitor
in
the
meantime
crow
assisted
by
the
entire
family
had
stowed
the
infant
a
girl
into
a
warm
bed
ministering
to
the
best
of
her
ability
to
its
meagre
but
vociferous
wants
there
was
no
more
sleep
in
the
crow
establishment
that
night
the
head
of
the
house
roused
a
half
dozen
neighbours
from
their
beds
to
tell
them
of
the
astounding
occurrence
with
the
perfectly
natural
result
that
one
and
all
hurried
over
to
see
the
baby
and
to
hear
the
particulars
early
next
morning
tinkletown
wagged
with
an
excitement
so
violent
that
it
threatened
to
end
in
a
municipal
convulsion
anderson
crow
home
was
besieged
the
snow
in
his
front
yard
was
packed
to
an
icy
consistency
by
the
myriad
of
footprints
that
fell
upon
it
the
interior
of
the
house
was
tracked
with
mud
and
slush
and
three
window
panes
were
broken
by
the
noses
of
curious
but
unwelcome
spectators
altogether
it
was
a
sensation
unequalled
in
the
history
of
the
village
through
it
all
the
baby
blinked
and
wept
and
cooed
in
perfect
peace
guarded
by
crow
and
the
faithful
progeny
who
had
been
left
by
the
stork
and
not
by
a
mysterious
stranger
the
missionary
societies
wanted
to
do
something
heroic
but
crow
headed
them
off
the
sewing
circle
got
ready
to
take
charge
of
affairs
but
crow
punctured
the
project
figuratively
the
churches
ached
for
a
chance
to
handle
the
infant
but
crow
stood
between
and
all
tinkletown
called
upon
anderson
crow
to
solve
the
mystery
before
it
was
a
day
older
it
purty
hard
to
solve
a
mystery
that
got
six
weeks
start
o
me
said
anderson
despairingly
but
i
try
you
bet
the
doggone
got
a
parent
or
two
somewhere
in
the
universe
an
i
locate
er
explode
somethin
i
got
a
private
opinion
about
it
myself
whatever
this
private
opinion
might
have
been
it
was
not
divulged
possibly
something
in
connection
with
it
might
have
accounted
for
the
temporary
annoyance
felt
by
nearly
every
respectable
woman
in
tinkletown
the
marshal
eyed
each
and
every
one
of
them
irrespective
of
position
condition
or
age
with
a
gleam
so
accusing
that
the
godliest
of
them
flushed
and
then
turned
cold
so
knowing
were
these
equitable
looks
that
before
night
every
woman
in
the
village
was
constrained
to
believe
the
worst
of
her
neighbour
and
almost
as
ready
to
look
with
suspicion
upon
herself
one
thing
was
certain
business
was
at
a
standstill
in
tinkletown
the
old
men
forgot
their
chess
and
checker
games
at
the
corner
store
young
men
neglected
their
love
affairs
women
forgot
to
talk
about
each
other
children
froze
their
ears
rather
than
miss
any
of
the
talk
that
went
about
the
wintry
streets
everybody
was
asking
the
question
whose
baby
is
it
but
the
greatest
sensation
of
all
came
late
in
the
day
when
crow
in
going
over
the
garments
worn
by
the
babe
found
a
note
addressed
to
anderson
crow
it
was
stitched
to
the
baby
dress
and
proved
beyond
question
that
the
strange
visitor
of
the
night
before
had
selected
not
only
the
house
but
the
individual
the
note
was
to
the
point
it
said
february
anderson
crow
to
your
good
and
merciful
care
an
unhappy
creature
consigns
this
helpless
though
babe
all
the
world
knows
you
to
be
a
tender
loving
unselfish
man
and
father
the
writer
humbly
prayerfully
implores
you
to
care
for
this
babe
as
you
would
for
one
of
your
own
it
is
best
that
her
origin
be
kept
a
secret
care
for
her
cherish
her
as
your
own
and
at
the
end
of
each
year
the
sum
of
a
thousand
dollars
will
be
paid
to
you
as
long
as
she
lives
in
your
household
as
a
member
thereof
do
not
seek
to
find
her
parents
it
would
be
a
fool
errand
may
god
bless
you
and
yours
and
may
god
care
for
and
protect
rosalie
the
name
she
shall
bear
obviously
there
was
no
signature
and
absolutely
no
clew
to
the
identity
of
the
writer
two
telegraph
line
repairers
who
had
been
working
near
crow
house
during
the
night
repairing
damage
done
by
the
blizzard
gave
out
the
news
that
they
had
seen
a
cloaked
and
woman
standing
near
the
methodist
church
just
before
midnight
evidently
disregarding
the
rage
of
the
storm
the
sight
was
so
unusual
that
the
men
paused
and
gazed
at
her
for
several
minutes
one
of
them
was
about
to
approach
her
when
she
turned
and
fled
down
the
side
street
near
by
was
she
carryin
a
big
bundle
asked
anderson
crow
the
men
replied
in
the
negative
then
she
could
have
been
the
party
wanted
the
one
we
after
certainly
had
a
big
bundle
but
crow
is
it
possible
that
these
men
saw
her
after
she
left
the
basket
at
began
the
presbyterian
minister
that
ai
the
way
i
deduce
it
observed
the
town
detective
tartly
in
the
first
place
she
would
been
standin
like
that
if
the
job
was
over
would
she
would
she
been
streakin
out
fer
home
she
would
she
may
have
paused
near
the
church
to
see
whether
you
took
the
child
in
persisted
the
divine
but
she
could
have
saw
my
porch
from
the
back
end
of
the
church
nobody
said
she
was
standing
back
of
the
church
said
the
lineman
what
that
you
do
mean
it
cried
anderson
pulling
out
of
a
difficulty
bravely
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
why
did
you
say
she
was
in
front
of
the
church
cai
you
see
wasted
time
here
jest
because
you
did
have
sense
to
anybody
ought
to
know
it
being
told
you
old
rube
growled
the
lineman
who
was
from
boggs
city

you
i
wo
no

anderson

started
a
new
train
of
thought
in
anderson
perplexed
mind

terrible
night

by
a

of

gasped
and
looked
at
him
if

a
husband
he
do
know
he
the
father
of
this
here
baby
do

of

have
now
the
thing
fer

first
is
to

a
search
to

locate
a
typewritin
machine
anywheres

the
way
toby

cai
you
see
i
want
ter
get
started
on
this
job
say
anderson
said
harry
squires
the
reporter
i
like
to
ask
if
there
is
any
one
in
tinkletown
male
or
female
who
can
afford
to
pay
you
a
thousand
dollars
a
year
for
taking
care
of
that
kid
what
that
slowly
oozed
from
anderson
lips
you
heard
what
i
said
say
do
you
know
you
can
bring
up
a
kid
in
this
town
for
eleven
or
twelve
dollars
a
year
you
do
know
what
you
talkin
about
burst
from
indignant
lips
but
he
found
instant
excuse
to
retire
from
the
circle
of
speculators
a
few
minutes
later
he
and
his
wife
were
surreptitiously
the
note
both
filled
with
the
fear
that
it
said
instead
of
chapter
vi
reflection
and
deduction
by
gum
it
does
say
a
thousand
cried
anderson
mightily
relieved
harry
squires
is
a
fool
he
said
jest
now
that
it
could
be
did
fer
eleven
or
twelve
dollars
do
you
suppose
eva
that
the
mother
of
this
here
child
knows
what
it
costs
to
bring
up
of
course
she
does
when
i
find
her
i
prove
it
by
her
own
lips
that
she
knows
but
bother
me
any
more
eva
i
got
to
git
out
an
track
her
down
this
is
the
greatest
job
i
had
in
years
see
here
anderson
said
his
wife
thoughtfully
and
somewhat
stealthily
let
go
slow
about
this
thing
what
do
you
want
to
find
her
for
why
why
doggone
it
eva
what
air
you
talkin
about
began
he
in
amazement
well
it
just
this
way
i
do
think
we
can
earn
a
thousand
dollars
a
year
easier
than
takin
care
of
this
child
do
you
see
suppose
we
keep
her
fer
twenty
years
that
means
twenty
thousand
dollars
do
it
it
beats
a
pension
all
to
pieces
well
by
ginger
gasped
anderson
vaguely
comprehending
fifty
years
would
mean
fifty
thousand
dollars
would
it
gee
whiz
eva
i
do
imagine
we
can
keep
her
that
long
no
reflectively
the
chances
are
she
want
ter
git
married
inside
of
that
time
they
always
that
anderson
you
an
me
have
to
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
that
so
we
ai
spring
chickens
are
we
deary
she
put
her
hard
bony
hand
in
his
and
there
was
a
suspicion
of
moisture
in
the
kindly
old
eyes
i
love
to
hear
you
call
me
anderson
we
never
get
too
old
for
that
he
coughed
and
then
patted
her
hand
rather
confusedly
anderson
had
long
since
forgotten
the
meaning
of
sentiment
but
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
had
not
forgotten
how
to
love
his
wife
shucks
he
muttered
bravely
we
be
kissin
like
a
couple
of
young
jay
birds
first
thing
we
know
doggone
if
it
ai
funny
how
a
baby
even
if
it
is
some
one
else
kinder
makes
a
feller
he
intends
to
be
hand
in
hand
they
watched
the
sleeping
innocent
for
several
minutes
finally
the
detective
shook
himself
and
spoke
well
eva
i
got
to
make
a
bluff
at
findin
out
whose
baby
it
is
i
my
reputation
at
stake
i
jest
have
to
investigate
i
do
see
that
any
harm
can
come
from
that
anderson
she
replied
and
neither
appreciated
the
sarcasm
unintentionally
involved
i
wo
waste
another
minute
he
announced
promptly
i
will
stick
to
my
theory
that
the
parents
live
in
tinkletown
fiddlesticks
snorted
crow
disgustedly
and
then
left
him
to
cultivate
the
choleric
anger
her
exclamation
had
inspired
doggone
i
wish
i
had
patted
her
hand
he
lamented
she
deserve
it
consarn
it
a
woman
always
doin
something
to
spoil
things
and
so
he
fared
forth
with
his
badges
and
stars
bent
on
duty
but
not
accomplishment
all
the
town
soon
knew
that
he
was
following
a
clew
but
all
the
town
was
at
sea
concerning
its
character
origin
and
plausibility
a
dozen
persons
saw
him
stop
young
perkins
in
front
of
lamson
store
and
the
same
spectators
saw
his
feathers
droop
as
she
let
loose
her
wrath
upon
his
head
and
went
away
with
her
nose
in
the
air
and
her
cheeks
far
more
scarlet
than
when
boreas
kissed
them
and
all
in
response
to
a
single
remark
volunteered
by
the
faithful
detective
he
entered
lamson
store
a
moment
later
singularly
abashed
and
red
in
the
face
doggone
he
observed
seeing
that
an
explanation
was
expected
she
might
knowed
i
was
only
foolin
a
few
minutes
later
he
had
alf
reesling
the
town
sot
in
a
far
corner
of
the
store
talking
to
him
in
a
most
peremptory
fashion
it
may
be
well
to
mention
that
alf
had
so
far
forgotten
himself
as
to
laugh
at
the
marshal
temporary
discomfiture
at
the
hands
of
perkins
alf
have
you
been
havin
another
baby
up
to
your
house
without
me
know
demanded
anderson
firmly
anderson
replied
alf
maudlin
tears
starting
in
his
eyes
it
not
kind
of
you
to
rake
up
my
feelin
like
this
you
know
i
been
a
widower
fer
three
years
i
want
you

one
thing

a
detective

me
warn
you

are
under
suspicion

me
tell
you
one
thing
more
doggone

ornery
hide

ever
laugh
like
you
did
jest
now
er
i
just
then
the
door
flew
open
with
a
bang
and
edna
crow
eldest
almost
flopped
into
the
store
her
cap
in
her
hand
eyes
starting
from
her
head
she
had
run
at
top
speed
all
the
way
from
home
pop
she
gasped
ma
says
fer
you
to
hurry
home

says
fer
you
to
anderson
covered
the
distance
between
lamson
store
and
his
own
home
in
record
time
indeed
edna
flying
as
fast
as
her
slim
legs
could
twinkle
barely
beat
her
father
to
the
front
porch
it
was
quite
clear
to
crow
that
something
unusual
had
happened
or
crow
would
not
have
summoned
him
so
peremptorily
she
was
in
the
hallway
downstairs
awaiting
his
arrival
visibly
agitated
before
uttering
a
word
she
dragged
him
into
the
little
and
closed
the
door
they
were
alone
is
it
dead
he
panted
no
but
what
do
you
think
anderson
she
questioned
excitedly
i
ai
had
time
to
think

mean
to
say

begun
to
talk
an
tell
who
it

a
feller
anderson

regular
scamp
i
take
a
look
at
him
an
ast
fer
his
badge
marshal
crow
paraded
boldly
into
the
kitchen
where
the
strange
man
was
regaling
the
younger
crows
with
conversation
the
while
he
partook
comfortably
of
pie
and
other
things
more
substantial
are
you
mr
crow
he
asked
nonchalantly
as
anderson
appeared
before
him
i
am
who
are
you
i
am
hawkshaw
the
detective
responded
the
man
his
mouth
full
of
blackberry
pie
gee
whiz
gasped
anderson
eva
it
the
celebrated
hawkshaw
right
you
are
sir
i
after
the
kid
you
have
to
identify
it
something
inspired
anderson
to
say
sure
that
easy
it
the
one
that
was
left
on
your
doorstep
last
night
said
the
man
glibly
well
i
guess
you
right
began
anderson
disconsolately
boy
or
girl
demanded
crow
shrewdly
and
very
quickly
she
had
been
inspecting
the
man
more
closely
than
before
and
woman
intuition
was
telling
her
a
truth
that
anderson
overlooked
hawkshaw
was
not
only
very
seedy
but
very
drunk
madam
he
responded
loftily
it
is
nothing
but
a
mere
child
i
give
you
jest
one
minute
to
get
out
of
this
house
said
crow
sharply
to
anderson
consternation
if
you
not
gone
i
douse
you
with
this
kettle
of
scalding
water
open
the
back
door
edna
he
take
his
dirty
self
through
my
parlour
again
that
door
edna
edna
half
paralysed
with
astonishment
opened
the
kitchen
door
just
in
time
hawkshaw
was
not
so
drunk
but
he
could
recognise
disaster
when
it
hovered
near
as
she
lifted
the
steaming
kettle
from
the
stove
he
made
a
flying
leap
for
the
door
the
rush
of
air
that
followed
him
as
he
shot
through
the
aperture
almost
swept
edna
from
her
feet
in
ten
seconds
the
tattered
hawkshaw
was
scrambling
over
the
garden
fence
and
making
lively
if
inaccurate
tracks
through
last
year
cabbage
patch
chapter
vii
the
mysterious
visitor
the
entire
crow
family
watched
him
in
stupefaction
until
he
disappeared
down
the
lane
that
led
to
hapgood
grove
it
was
then
and
not
until
then
that
anderson
crow
took
a
breath
good
lord
eva
what
do
you
mean
he
gasped
mean
she
almost
shrieked
anderson
crow
did
you
recognise
that
feller
he
ai
no
more
detective
than
you
er
me
he
the
tramp
that
you
put
in
the
calaboose
last
week
and
the
week
before
too
i
thought
i
seen
his
ugly
face
before
he
great
jumpin
geeswax
roared
the
town
marshal
i
recollect
him
now
he
the
one
that
said
he
been
exposed
to
smallpox
an
wanted
to
be
kept
where
it
was
warm
all
winter
well
i
be
i
be
do
say
it
pa
he
said
it
fer
you
when
he
clumb
over
that
fence
out
there
cried
edna
gleefully
several
days
of
anxiety
and
energy
followed
this
interesting
episode
in
that
time
two
tramps
attempted
to
obtain
food
and
shelter
at
home
one
on
the
plea
that
he
was
the
father
of
the
unfortunate
child
the
other
as
an
officer
for
the
foundlings
home
at
boggs
city
three
babies
were
left
on
the
doorstep
two
in
one
night
their
fond
mothers
confessing
fessing
by
letters
that
they
appreciated
charitable
inclinations
and
implored
him
to
care
for
their
offspring
as
if
they
were
his
own
the
harassed
marshal
experienced
some
difficulty
in
forcing
the
mothers
to
take
back
their
children
in
each
instance
he
was
reviled
by
the
estimable
ladies
all
of
whom
accused
him
of
being
utterly
heartless
crow
came
to
his
rescue
and
told
the
disappointed
mothers
that
the
scalding
water
was
ready
for
application
if
they
did
not
take
their
baskets
of
babies
away
on
short
order
it
may
be
well
for
the
reputation
of
tinkletown
to
mention
that
one
of
the
donors
was
raspus
a
negro
washerwoman
who
did
work
for
the
dagoes
engaged
in
building
the
railroad
hard
by
another
was
the
wife
of
antonio
galli
a
member
of
the
grading
gang
and
the
third
was
mrs
pool
the
widow
of
a
fisherman
who
had
recently
drowned
himself
in
drink
it
is
quite
possible
that
anderson
might
have
had
the
three
infants
on
his
hands
permanently
had
not
the
mothers
been
so
eager
to
know
their
fate
they
appeared
in
person
early
the
next
morning
to
see
if
the
babies
had
frozen
to
death
on
the
doorstep
mrs
pool
even
went
so
far
as
to
fetch
some
extra
baby
clothes
which
she
had
neglected
to
drop
with
her
male
raspus
came
for
her
basket
claiming
it
was
the
only
one
she
had
in
which
to
tote
the
washing
for
the
men
after
these
annoying
but
enlivening
incidents
anderson
was
permitted
to
recover
from
his
daze
and
to
throw
off
symptoms
of
nervous
prostration
tinkletown
resumed
its
tranquil
attitude
and
the
checker
games
began
to
thrive
once
more
little
rosalie
was
a
week
older
than
when
she
came
but
it
was
five
weeks
before
anything
happened
to
disturb
the
even
tenor
of
the
way
he
had
worked
diligently
in
the
effort
to
discover
the
parents
of
the
baby
but
without
result
two
or
three
exasperated
husbands
in
tinkletown
had
threatened
to
blow
his
brains
out
if
he
persisted
in
questioning
their
wives
in
his
insinuating
manner
and
one
of
the
kitchen
girls
at
the
village
inn
threw
a
dishpan
at
him
on
the
occasion
of
his
third
visit
of
inquiry
a
colored
woman
in
the
employ
of
the
baptist
minister
denied
that
rosalie
was
her
child
but
when
he
insisted
agreed
with
fine
sarcasm
to
go
over
an
have
a
look
at
it
after
his
assurance
that
it
was
perfectly
white
eva
i
investigated
the
case
thoroughly
he
said
at
last
there
is
no
solution
to
the
mystery
the
only
thing
i
deduce
is
that
the
child
is
here
an
we
have
to
take
keer
of
her
now
i
wonder
if
that
woman
really
meant
it
when
she
said
we
have
a
thousand
dollars
at
the
end
of
each
year
doggone
i
wish
the
year
was
up
jest
to
see
we
have
to
wait
anderson
that
all
said
crow
i
love
the
baby
so
it
ca
matter
much
i
glad
you
through
investigatin
it
been
most
tryin
to
me
half
the
women
in
town
do
speak
to
me
it
was
at
the
end
of
rosalie
fifth
week
as
a
member
of
the
family
that
something
happened
late
one
night
when
anderson
opened
the
front
door
to
put
out
the
cat
a
heavily
veiled
woman
mounted
the
steps
and
accosted
him
in
some
trepidation
he
drew
back
and
would
have
closed
the
door
but
for
her
eager
remonstrance
i
must
see
you
crow
she
cried
in
a
low
agitated
voice
who
are
you
he
demanded
she
was
dressed
entirely
in
black
i
came
to
see
you
about
the
baby

three
tramps

an
i
i
see
her
crow
pleaded
the
stranger
and
he
was
struck
by
the
richness
of
her
voice
mighty
queer
it
seems
to
me
he
muttered
hesitatingly
are
you
any
kin
to
it
i
am
very
much
interested
by
giminy
i
believe
you
the
one
who
left
her
here
cried
the
detective
are
you
a
typewriter
i
answer
your
questions
if
you
allow
me
to
step
inside
it
is
very
cold
out
here
anderson
crow
stood
aside
and
the
tall
black
figure
entered
the
hall
he
led
her
to
the
warm
and
gave
her
a
chair
before
the
here
crow
is
an
envelope
containing
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
that
proves
my
good
faith
i
can
not
tell
you
who
i
am
nor
what
relation
i
bear
to
the
baby
i
am
quite
fully
aware
that
you
will
not
undertake
to
detain
me
for
it
is
not
an
easy
matter
to
earn
a
thousand
dollars
a
year
in
this
part
of
the
world
i
am
going
abroad
next
week
and
do
not
expect

a
long
long
time

as
i
would
i
could
not
go
without
seeing
the
child
i
will
not
keep
you
out
of

ten
minutes
and
you

your
wife
may
be
present
while
i
hold
rosalie

my
arms
i
know
that
she
is
in
good
hands
and
i
have
no
intention
of
taking
her
away
please
call
mrs
crow
anderson
was
too
amazed
to
act
at
once
he
began
to
flounder
interrogatively
but
the
visitor
abruptly
checked
him
you
are
wasting
time
crow
in
attempting
to
question
my
authority
or
identity
no
one
need
know
that
i
have
made
this
visit
you
are
perfectly
secure
in
the
promise
to
have
a
thousand
dollars
a
year
why
should
you
hesitate
as
long
as
she
lives
with
you
the
money
is
yours
i
am
advancing
the
amount
you
now
hold
in
order
that
her
immediate
wants
may
be
provided
for
you
are
not
required
to
keep
an
account
of
the
money
paid
to
you
there
are
means
of
ascertaining
at
once
whether
she
is
being
well
cared
for
and
educated
by
you
and
if
it
becomes
apparent
that
you
are
not
doing
your
duty
she
shall
be
removed
from
your
custody
from
time
to
time
you
may
expect
written
instructions
from
from
one
who
loves
her
i
jest
want
to
ast
if
you
live
in
tinkletown
anderson
managed
to
say
i
do
not
she
replied
emphatically
well
then
lift
your
veil
if
you
do
live
here
i
know
you
i
prefer
to
keep
my
face
covered
crow
believe
me
and
trust
me
please
let
me
see
her
the
plea
was
so
earnest
that
anderson
heart
gave
a
great
thump
of
understanding
by
ginger
you
are
her
mother
he
gasped
crow
came
in
at
this
juncture
and
she
was
much
quicker
at
grasping
the
situation
than
her
husband
it
was
in
her
mind
to
openly
denounce
the
woman
for
her
heartlessness
but
her
natural
thriftiness
interposed
she
would
do
nothing
that
might
remove
the
golden
spoon
from
the
family
mouth
the
trio
stole
upstairs
and
into
the
warm
bedchamber
there
with
anderson
crow
and
his
wife
looking
on
from
a
remote
corner
of
the
room
the
tall
woman
in
black
knelt
beside
the
crib
that
had
housed
a
generation
of
crows
the
sleeping
rosalie
did
not
know
of
the
soft
kisses
that
swept
her
little
cheek
she
did
not
feel
the
tears
that
fell
when
the
visitor
lifted
her
veil
nor
did
she
hear
the
whisperings
that
rose
to
the
woman
lips
that
is
all
murmured
the
mysterious
stranger
at
last
dropping
her
veil
as
she
arose
she
staggered
as
she
started
for
the
door
but
recovered
herself
instantly
without
a
word
she
left
the
room
the
crows
following
her
down
the
stairs
in
silence
at
the
bottom
she
paused
and
then
extended
her
hands
to
the
old
couple
her
voice
faltered
as
she
spoke
let
me
clasp
your
hands
and
let
me
tell
you
that
my
love
and
my
prayers
are
forever
for
you
and
for
that
little
one
up
there
thank
you
i
know
you
will
be
good
to
her
she
is
well
born
her
blood
is
as
good
as
the
best
above
all
things
crow
she
is
not
illegitimate
you
may
easily
suspect
that
her
parents
are
wealthy
or
they
could
not
pay
so
well
for
her
care
some
day
the
mystery
surrounding
her
will
be
cleared
it
may
not
be
for
many
years
i
can
safely
say
that
she
will
be
left
in
your
care
for
twenty
years
at
least
some
day
you
will
know
why
it
is
that
rosalie
is
not
supposed
to
exist
god
bless
you
she
was
gone
before
they
could
utter
a
word
they
watched
her
walk
swiftly
into
the
darkness
a
few
minutes
later
the
sound
of
carriage
wheels
suddenly
broke
upon
the
air
anderson
crow
and
his
wife
stood
over
the
and
there
were
tears
in
their
thoughtful
eyes
she
said
twenty
years
eva
let
see
this
is
what
would
that
make
it
about
or
anderson
well
i
guess
we
wait
if
other
people
can
mused
he
then
they
went
slowly
upstairs
and
to
bed
chapter
viii
some
years
go
by
tinkletown
as
a
unit
supported
anderson
in
his
application
for
guardianship
papers
they
were
filed
immediately
after
the
secret
visit
of
the
mysterious
woman
the
circuit
court
at
boggs
city
after
hearing
the
evidence
at
once
entered
the
appointment
of
crow
when
the
court
asked
in
mild
surprise
why
he
did
not
adopt
the
child
anderson
and
eva
looked
at
each
other
sheepishly
and
were
silent
for
a
full
minute
then
anderson
spoke
up
a
bit
huskily
well
you
see
judge
her
name
would
have
to
be
crow
an
while
it
a
good
name
an
an
honoured
one
it
do
jest
seem
to
fit
the
young
she
to
be
more
of
a
canary
than
a
crow
figuratively
speakin
and
eva
an
me
jest
decided
we
give
her
a
different
sort
of
a
last
name
if
we
could
find
one
seems
to
me
that
rosie
canary
would
be
a
good
one
but
eva
an
the
childern
are
me
they
decided
to
call
her
rosalie
gray
an
i
guess
that
about
settles
it
if
you
do
mind
i
reckon
that
name
go
in
the
records
besides
you
must
recollect
that
she
liable
to
have
a
lot
of
property
some
time
an
it
seems
more
fit
fer
me
to
be
guardian
than
if
that
time
ever
comes
be
easier
to
say
if
she
keers
to
leave
us
that
same
day
anderson
deposited
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
to
his
credit
in
the
first
national
bank
saying
to
his
wife
as
he
walked
away
from
the
teller
window
i
guess
rosalie
cai
starve
till
the
bank
busts
an
maybe
not
then
of
course
tinkletown
knew
that
a
sum
of
money
had
been
paid
to
anderson
but
no
one
knew
that
it
had
been
handed
to
him
in
person
by
an
interested
party
had
anderson
and
his
wife
even
whispered
that
such
a
visit
had
occurred
the
town
would
have
gone
into
a
convulsion
of
wrath
the
marshal
pedestal
would
have
been
jerked
out
from
under
him
without
compunction
or
mercy
eva
cautioned
him
to
be
more
than
silent
on
the
subject
for
the
child
sake
as
well
as
for
their
own
and
anderson
saw
wisdom
in
her
counselling
he
even
lagged
in
his
avowed
intention
to
unravel
the
mystery
or
die
in
the
attempt
a
sharp
reminder
in
the
shape
of
an
item
in
the
restored
his
energies
and
he
again
took
up
the
case
with
a
vigour
that
startled
even
himself
anything
in
the
shape
of
vigour
startled
his
wife
harry
squires
the
reporter
who
poked
more
or
less
fun
at
anderson
from
time
to
time
because
he
had
the
power
of
the
press
behind
him
some
weeks
later
wrote
the
following
item
about
the
baby
mystery
as
he
called
it
in
large
type
there
is
no
news
in
regard
to
the
child
found
upon
the
doorstep
of
our
esteemed
anderson
crow
last
february
the
item
concerning
its
discovery
first
appeared
in
the
columns
of
the
as
will
be
remembered
by
our
many
readers
detective
crow
promised
developments
some
time
ago
but
they
have
not
showed
up
it
is
rumoured
that
he
has
a
new
clew
but
it
can
not
be
substantiated
the
general
impression
is
that
he
does
not
know
whether
it
is
a
boy
or
girl
we
advise
crow
to
go
slow
he
should
not
forget
the
time
when
he
arrested
john
barnes
two
years
ago
for
the
murder
of
grover
and
afterward
found
that
the
young
gent
was
merely
eloping
with
judge
brewster
daughter
which
was
no
crime
we
saw
the
girl
those
of
our
readers
who
were
alive
at
the
time
doubtless
recall
the
excitement
of
that
two
years
ago
barnes
as
innocent
as
a
child
unborn
came
to
our
little
city
engaged
in
the
innocent
pastime
of
getting
married
at
the
same
time
it
was
reported
that
a
murder
had
been
committed
in
this
county
crow
had
his
suspicions
aroused
and
pursued
barnes
down
the
river
and
arrested
him
it
was
a
fine
piece
of
detective
work
but
unfortunately
for
crow
the
real
murderer
had
been
caught
in
the
meantime
barnes
was
guilty
only
of
stealing
judge
brewster
daughter
and
getting
married
to
her
the
last
heard
of
them
they
were
happy
in
new
york
they
even
forgave
crow
it
is
reported
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
our
clever
detective
will
soon
jump
down
upon
the
heartless
parents
of
this
innocent
child
but
it
is
also
to
be
hoped
that
he
think
at
least
four
times
before
he
leaps
to
say
that
the
foregoing
editorial
disturbed
the
evenness
of
temper
would
be
saying
nothing
at
all
in
the
privacy
of
his
barn
lot
anderson
did
a
war
dance
that
shamed
tecumseh
he
threatened
to
annihilate
harry
squires
from
head
to
foot
for
publishing
the
base
slander
doggone
his
hide
roared
poor
anderson
fer
two
cents
i
tell
all
i
know
about
him
bein
tight
up
at
boggs
city
three
years
ago
he
walk
half
an
inch
that
time
without
staggerin
anyhow
i
would
have
chased
barnes
that
time
if
it
had
been
fer
harry
squires
he
egged
me
on
doggone
his
hide
if
he
did
have
that
big
typesetter
from
albany
over
at
the
office
to
back
him
up
i
go
over
bust
his
snoot
fer
him
after
all
the
items
i
give
him
too
all
the
thanks
you
git
fer
gittin
up
news
fer
them
blamed
reporters
but
i
show
him
i
wonder
what
he
think
if
i
traced
that
baby
right
up
to
his
own
that
eva
well
now
you
do
know
anything
about
it
neither
so
keep
your
mouth
shet
harry
squires
is
a
purty
sly
cuss
mebby
it
you
ai
supposed
to
know
you
jest
let
me
do
my
own
deducin
i
do
want
no
blamed
woman
tellin
me
who
to
shadder
an
you
too
edner

way
consarn
ye
the
next
thing
be
tellin
me
what
to
do
an
me
your
father
too
and
that
is
why
anderson
crow
resumed
his
search
for
the
parents
of
rosalie
gray
not
that
he
hoped
or
expected
to
find
them
but
to
offset
the
pernicious
influence
of
harry
item
for
many
days
he
followed
the
most
highly
impossible
clews
some
of
them
intractable
to
supply
a
rather
unusual
word
of
description
in
other
words
they
reacted
with
a
vigour
that
often
found
him
unprepared
but
serene
consequences
bothered
anderson
but
little
in
those
days
of
despised
activity
it
is
not
necessary
to
dwell
upon
the
incidents
of
the
ensuing
years
which
saw
rosalie
crawl
from
babyhood
to
childhood
and
then
stride
proudly
through
the
teens
with
a
springiness
that
boded
ill
for
father
time
regularly
each
succeeding
february
there
came
to
anderson
crow
a
package
of
twenty
dollar
bills
amounting
to
one
thousand
dollars
the
mails
being
inscrutable
the
crow
family
prospered
correspondingly
but
there
was
a
liberal
frugality
behind
it
all
that
meant
well
for
rosalie
when
the
time
came
for
an
accounting
anderson
and
eva
laid
by
a
goodly
portion
of
the
money
for
the
child
whom
they
loved
as
one
of
their
own
flesh
and
blood
the
district
school
lessons
were
followed
later
on
by
a
education
down
state
and
then
came
the
finishing
touches
at
miss
brown
in
new
york
rosalie
grew
into
a
rare
flower
as
dainty
as
the
rose
as
piquant
as
the
daisy
the
unmistakable
mark
of
the
high
bred
glowed
in
her
face
the
fine
traces
of
blue
blood
graced
her
every
movement
her
every
tone
and
look
at
the
time
that
she
as
well
as
every
one
else
in
tinkletown
for
that
matter
was
twenty
years
older
than
when
she
first
came
to
anderson
home
we
find
her
the
queen
of
the
village
its
one
rich
human
possession
its
one
truly
sophisticated
inhabitant
anderson
crow
and
his
wife
were
so
proud
of
her
that
they
forgot
their
duty
to
their
own
offspring
but
if
the
crow
children
resented
this
it
was
not
exhibited
in
the
expressions
of
love
and
admiration
for
their
edna
crow
the
eldest
of
the
girls
anderson
called
her
edner
was
rosalie
most
devoted
slave
while
roscoe
the
boy
who
comprised
the
rear
rank
of
anderson
little
army
knelt
so
constantly
at
her
shrine
that
he
fell
far
behind
in
his
studies
and
stuck
to
the
third
reader
for
two
years
anderson
had
not
been
idle
in
all
these
years
he
was
fast
approaching
his
seventieth
anniversary
but
he
was
not
a
day
older
in
spirit
than
when
we
first
made
his
acquaintance
true
his
hair
was
thinner
and
whiter
and
his
whiskers
straggled
a
little
more
carelessly
than
in
other
days
but
he
was
as
young
and
active
as
a
youth
of
twenty
hard
times
did
not
worry
him
nor
did
domestic
troubles
crow
often
admitted
that
she
tried
her
best
to
worry
him
but
it
was
like
pouring
water
on
a
duck
back
he
went
blissfully
on
his
way
earning
encomiums
for
himself
and
honours
for
tinkletown
there
was
no
grave
crime
committed
in
the
land
that
he
did
not
have
a
scheme
for
apprehending
the
perpetrators
his
deductions
at
lamson
store
never
failed
to
draw
out
and
hold
large
audiences
and
no
one
disputed
his
theories
in
public
the
fact
that
he
was
responsible
for
the
arrest
of
various
hog
horse
and
chicken
thieves
from
time
to
time
and
for
the
continuous
seizure
of
the
two
town
drunkards
tom
folly
and
alf
reesling
kept
his
reputation
untarnished
despite
the
numerous
errors
of
commission
and
omission
that
crept
in
between
that
rosalie
mysterious
friends
or
enemies
it
might
have
been
kept
close
and
accurate
watch
over
her
was
manifested
from
time
to
time
once
when
anderson
was
very
ill
with
typhoid
fever
the
package
of
bills
was
accompanied
by
an
unsigned
typewritten
letter
the
writer
announced
that
crow
state
of
health
was
causing
some
anxiety
on
rosalie
account
the
child
was
then
six
years
old
and
it
was
hoped
that
nothing
serious
would
result
another
time
the
strange
writer
in
a
letter
from
paris
instructed
crow
to
send
rosalie
to
a
certain
boarding
school
and
to
see
that
she
had
french
german
and
music
from
competent
instructors
again
just
before
the
girl
went
to
new
york
for
her
two
years
stay
in
miss
brown
school
there
came
a
package
containing
for
her
own
personal
use
rosalie
often
spoke
to
anderson
of
this
mysterious
sender
as
the
fairy
godmother
but
the
old
marshal
had
a
deeper
and
more
significant
opinion
perhaps
the
most
anxious
period
in
the
life
of
anderson
crow
came
when
rosalie
was
about
ten
years
old
a
new
sheriff
had
been
elected
in
bramble
county
and
he
posed
as
a
reformer
his
sister
taught
school
in
tinkletown
and
rosalie
was
her
favourite
she
took
an
interest
in
the
child
that
was
almost
the
undoing
of
crow
prosperity
imagining
that
she
was
befriending
the
girl
the
teacher
appealed
to
her
brother
the
sheriff
insisting
that
he
do
what
he
could
to
solve
the
mystery
of
her
birth
the
sheriff
saw
a
chance
to
distinguish
himself
he
enlisted
the
help
of
an
aggressive
prosecuting
attorney
also
new
and
set
about
to
investigate
the
case
the
two
officers
of
the
law
descended
upon
tinkletown
one
day
and
began
to
ask
peremptory
questions
they
went
about
it
in
such
a
lordly
manner
that
anderson
took
alarm
and
his
heart
sank
like
lead
he
saw
in
his
mind
eye
the
utter
collapse
of
all
his
hopes
the
dashing
away
of
his
cup
of
leisure
and
the
upsetting
of
the
fairy
godmother
plans
pulling
his
wits
together
he
set
about
to
frustrate
the
attack
of
the
meddlers
whether
it
was
his
shrewdness
in
placing
obstacles
in
their
way
or
whether
he
coerced
the
denizens
into
blocking
the
investigation
does
not
matter
it
is
only
necessary
to
say
that
the
officious
gentleman
from
boggs
city
finally
gave
up
the
quest
in
disgust
and
retired
into
the
oblivion
usual
to
county
officials
who
try
to
be
progressive
it
was
many
weeks
however
before
anderson
slept
soundly
he
was
once
more
happy
in
the
consciousness
that
rosalie
had
been
saved
from
disaster
and
that
he
had
done
his
duty
by
her
i
like
to
know
how
them
doggone
jays
from
boggs
city
expected
to
find
out
anything
about
that
child
when
i
hai
been
able
to
growled
crow
in
lamson
store
one
night
if
they
jest
keep
their
blamed
noses
out
of
this
affair
i
find
out
who
her
parents
are
some
day
it
takes
time
to
trace
down
things
like
this
i
guess
i
know
what
doin
do
i
boys
that
what
you
do
anderson
said
lamson
as
anderson
reached
over
and
took
a
handful
of
licorice
drops
from
the
jar
on
the
counter
chapter
ix
the
village
queen
the
spring
of
brought
rosalie
back
to
tinkletown
after
her
second
and
last
year
with
miss
brown
in
new
york
city
the
sun
seemed
brighter
the
birds
sang
more
blithely
the
flowers
took
on
a
new
fragrance
and
the
village
spruced
up
as
if
sunday
was
the
only
day
in
the
week
the
young
men
of
the
town
trembled
when
she
passed
them
by
and
not
a
few
of
them
grew
thin
and
haggard
for
want
of
food
and
sleep
having
lost
both
appetite
and
repose
through
a
relapse
in
love
her
smile
was
the
same
as
of
yore
her
cheery
greetings
the
same
and
yet
the
village
swains
stood
in
awe
of
this
fine
young
aristocrat
for
days
and
days
gradually
it
dawned
upon
them
that
she
was
human
after
all
despite
her
new
york
training
and
they
slowly
resumed
the
manner
of
courting
which
was
with
the
eyes
exclusively
a
few
of
the
more
venturesome
but
not
the
more
ardent
asked
her
to
go
walking
driving
or
to
the
church
sociables
and
there
was
a
rivalry
in
town
which
threatened
to
upset
commerce
there
was
no
theatre
in
tinkletown
but
they
delighted
in
her
descriptions
of
the
gorgeous
in
new
york
the
town
hall
seemed
smaller
than
ever
to
them
the
younger
merchants
and
their
clerks
neglected
business
with
charming
impartiality
and
trade
was
going
to
rack
and
ruin
until
rosalie
declined
to
marry
george
rawlins
the
minister
son
he
was
looked
upon
as
the
favoured
one
but
she
refused
him
in
such
a
decisive
manner
that
all
others
lost
hope
and
courage
it
is
on
record
that
the
day
after
george
tinkletown
indulged
in
a
complete
business
somersault
never
before
had
there
been
such
strict
attention
to
customers
merchants
and
clerks
alike
settled
down
to
the
inevitable
and
tried
to
banish
rosalie
face
from
the
cost
tags
and
trading
stamps
of
their
dull
mercantile
cloister
even
tony
brink
the
blacksmith
fell
into
the
habits
of
industry
but
with
an
that
got
him
kicked
through
a
partition
in
the
smithy
when
he
attempted
to
shoe
the
fetlock
of
martin
colt
instead
of
its
hoof
the
crow
family
took
on
a
new
dignity
anderson
gave
fifty
dollars
to
the
foreign
missionary
society
of
the
presbyterian
church
claiming
that
a
foreign
education
had
done
so
much
for
his
ward
and
crow
succeeded
in
holding
two
big
afternoon
teas
before
rosalie
could
apply
the
check
rein
one
night
anderson
sat
up
until
nearly
ten
an
proceeding
for
him
rosalie
with
the
elder
crow
girls
edna
and
susie
had
gone
to
protracted
meeting
with
a
party
of
young
men
and
women
the
younger
boys
and
girls
were
in
bed
and
crow
was
yawning
prodigiously
she
never
retired
until
anderson
was
ready
to
do
likewise
suddenly
it
dawned
upon
her
that
he
was
unusually
quiet
and
preoccupied
they
were
sitting
on
the
moonlit
porch
what

matter

doggone
eva
i

there
was
such
a
wail
of
bitterness
in
the
old
constable
remark
that
crow
felt
the
tears
start
to
her
own
eyes
it
was
the
girl
they
both
wanted
after
all
not
the
money
rosalie
coming
home
with
her
party
some
time
afterward
found
the
old
couple
still
seated
on
the
porch
the
young
people
could
not
conceal
their
surprise
counting
the
stars

bawled

ed
higgins
the

how
that
was
anderson
rebuke

crow
corrected
ed
with
a
nervous
glance
at
rosalie
who
had
been
his
companion
for
the
evening
oh

jest
remarked
anderson
mollified
how
was
the
party
it
was
a
party
daddy
crow
laughed
rosalie
seating
herself
in
front
of
him
on
the
porch
rail
it
was
an
experience

alf
reesling

anderson
but
i
guess
reformin

think
he
was
a
little
woozy

acquired
the

he
substituted
the
words
skeed
lit
up
just
to
show
his
worldliness
after
the
young
men
had
departed
and
the
crow
girls
had
gone
upstairs
with
their
mother
rosalie
slipped
out
on
the
porch
and
sat
herself
down
upon
the
knee
of
her
disconsolate
guardian

occupation

none
of
them
was
serious
daddy
she
said
naïvely
you
could
have
all
of
the
men
in
the
county
he
declared
proudly
only
he
added
quickly
it
would
seem
jest
right
an
proper
there
was
a
girl
at
miss
brown
a
year
ago
who
had
loads
of
money
and
yet
she
declared
she
was
going
to
have
an
occupation
nobody
knew
much
about
her
or
why
she
left
school
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
a
term
i
liked
her
for
she
was
very
nice
to
me
when
i
first
went
there
a
stranger
reddon
you
heard
me
speak
of
him
was
devoted
to
her
and
i
sure
she
liked
him
it
was
only
yesterday
i
heard
from
her
she
is
going
to
teach
school
in
this
township
next
winter
an
she
got
money
i
am
sure
she
had
it
in
those
days
it
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
that
she
should
be
coming
here
to
teach
school
in
no
congressman
ritchey
secured
the
appointment
for
her
she
says
the
township
trustee
whatever
his
name
is
for
a
long
time
insisted
that
he
must
appoint
a
teacher
from
tinkletown
and
not
an
outsider
i
am
glad
she
is
coming
here
because
well
daddy
because
she
is
like
the
girls
i
knew
in
the
city
she
has
asked
me
to
look
up
a
boarding
place
for
next
winter
do
you
know
of
any
one
daddy
who
could
let
her
have
a
nice
room
i
bet
my
ears
you
like
to
have
your
ma
take
her
in
right
here
but
i
do
see
how
it
be
done
there
so
derned
many
of
us
now
an
oh
i
did
mean
that
daddy
she
could
come
here
but
do
you
think
jim
holabird
would
take
her
in
for
the
winter
she
a
widder
she
might
let
her
have
jim
room
now
that
there
a
vacancy
you
might
go
over
an
ast
her
about
it
it
a
good
thing
she
a
friend
of
yourn
rosalie
because
if
she
was
i
have
to
fight
her
why
daddy
reproachfully
well
she
a
foreigner
an
i
do
think
it
right
to
give
her
a
job
when
we
got
so
many
home
products
that
want
the
place
an
who
look
unpopular
enough
to
fill
the
bill
i
fer
home
industry
every
time
as
this
girl
do
appear
to
need
the
place
i
do
see
what
business
congressman
ritchey
has
foolin
with
our
school
system
anyhow
he
better
be
reducin
the
tariff
er
increasin
the
pensions
down
to
washington
i
quite
agree
with
you
daddy
crow
said
rosalie
with
a
diplomacy
that
always
won
for
her
she
knew
precisely
how
to
handle
her
guardian
and
that
was
why
she
won
where
his
own
daughters
failed
and
now
daddy
go
to
bed
and
do
worry
about
me
you
have
me
on
your
hands
much
longer
than
you
think
or
want
what
time
is
it
anderson
patted
her
head
reflectively
as
he
solemnly
drew
his
huge
silver
from
an
unlocated
pocket
he
held
it
out
into
the
bright
moonlight
geminy
crickets
he
exclaimed
it
minutes
to
twelve
anderson
crow
policy
was
to
always
look
at
things
through
the
small
end
of
the
telescope
the
slow
hot
summer
wore
away
and
to
rosalie
it
was
the
longest
that
she
ever
had
experienced
she
was
tired
of
the
ceaseless
twaddle
of
tinkletown
its
flow
of
missions
sociables
george
rawlin
new
harvesting
and
politics
for
even
the
children
talked
politics
nor
did
the
assiduous
attentions
of
the
village
young
men
possess
the
power
to
shorten
the
days
for
her
and
they
certainly
lengthened
the
nights
she
liked
them
because
they
were
her
friends
from
the
beginning
and
rosalie
was
not
a
snob
not
for
the
world
would
she
have
hurt
the
feelings
of
one
poor
humble
adoring
soul
in
tinkletown
and
while
her
smile
was
none
the
less
sweet
her
laugh
none
the
less
joyous
in
her
heart
there
was
the
hidden
longing
that
smiled
only
in
dreams
she
longed
for
the
day
that
was
to
bring
elsie
banks
to
live
with
holabird
for
with
her
would
come
a
breath
of
the
world
she
had
known
for
two
years
and
which
she
had
learned
to
love
so
well
in
three
months
seven
men
had
asked
her
to
marry
them
of
the
seven
one
only
had
the
means
or
the
prospect
of
means
to
support
her
he
was
a
with
five
grown
children
anderson
took
occasion
to
warn
her
against
widowers
why
he
said
they
jest
like
widders
you
know
dave
smith
that
runs
the
tavern
down
street
do
you
well
doggone
ef
he
did
turn
in
an
marry
a
widder
with
seven
childern
an
a
husband
an
he
led
a
dog
life
ever
sence
seven
children
and
a
husband
daddy
crow
yep
her
derned
husband
would
stay
divorced
when
he
found
out
dave
could
support
a
fambly
as
big
as
that
he
figgered
it
would
be
jest
as
easy
to
take
keer
of
eight
as
seven
so
he
perlitely
attached
hisself
to
dave
kitchen
an
started
in
to
eat
hisself
to
death
dave
was
goin
to
have
his
wife
apply
fer
another
divorce
an
leave
the
name
blank
he
could
put
in
either
husband
ef
it
came
to
a
pinch
but
i
coaxed
him
out
of
it
he
finally
got
rid
of
the
feller
by
askin
him
one
day
to
sweep
out
the
office
he
could
eat
all
right
but
it
was
natural
fer
him
to
work
so
he
skipped
out
next
i
heerd
of
him
he
had
married
a
widder
who
was
gittin
a
pension
because
her
first
husband
fit
fer
his
country
the
government
shet
off
the
pension
jest
as
soon
as
she
got
married
and
then
that
blamed
cuss
took
in
washin
fer
her
he
stayed
away
from
home
on
but
as
every
day
was
with
her
he
did
see
her
by
daylight
fer
three
years
she
died
an
now
he
back
at
dave
he
calls
dave
his
it
required
all
of
anderson
social
and
official
diplomacy
to
forestall
an
indignation
meeting
when
it
was
announced
that
a
stranger
miss
banks
had
been
selected
to
teach
school
no
there
was
some
talk
of
mobbing
the
township
trustee
and
board
of
county
commissioners
but
anderson
secured
the
names
of
the
more
virulent
talkers
and
threatened
to
jail
them
for
conspiracy
why
anderson
almost
wailed
george
ray
that
girl
from
the
city
what
does
she
know
about
grammar
an
history
an
all
that
they
teach
anything
but
french
an
italian
in
the
cities
an
you
know
it
pshaw
sniffed
anderson
i
hate
grammar
an
always
did
i
talk
better
italian
than
grammar
right
now
an
i
hope
miss
banks
will
teach
every
child
in
the
district
how
to
talk
french
you
orter
hear
rosalie
talk
it
besides
rosie
says
she
a
nice
girl
an
an
needs
the
job
anderson
lied
bravely
but
he
swallowed
twice
in
doing
it
illustration
september
brought
elsie
banks
september
brought
elsie
banks
to
make
life
worth
living
for
rosalie
the
two
girls
were
constantly
together
talking
over
the
old
days
and
what
the
new
ones
were
to
bring
forth
especially
for
miss
gray
who
had
resumed
wood
carving
as
a
temporary
occupation
miss
banks
was
more
than
ever
reluctant
to
discuss
her
own
affairs
and
rosalie
after
a
few
trials
was
tactful
enough
to
respect
her
mute
appeal
it
is
doubtful
if
either
of
the
girls
mentioned
the
name
of
big
handsome
tom
reddon
tom
who
had
rowed
in
his
college
crew
but
it
is
safe
to
say
that
both
of
them
thought
of
him
more
than
once
those
long
soft
autumn
nights
nights
when
tinkletown
beaux
were
fairly
tumbling
over
themselves
in
the
effort
to
make
new
york
life
seem
like
a
flimsy
shadow
in
comparison
chapter
xi
elsie

aderson
crow
stood
afar
off
among
the
bleak
leafless
trees
of
grove
and
gazed
thoughtfully
even
earnestly
upon
the
little
red
schoolhouse
with
its
high
brick
chimney
and
roof
a
biting
january
wind
cut
through
his
whiskers
and
warmed
his
nose
to
a
shade
of
red
on
the
lapel
of
his
overcoat
glistened
his
social
and
official
badges
augmented
by
a
new
and
particularly
shiny
emblem
of
respect
bestowed
by
the
citizens
of
tinkletown
at
first
it
had
been
the
sense
of
the
town
to
erect
a
monument
in
recognition
of
his
part
in
the
capture
of
the
bramble
county
gang
but
a
thrifty
and
considerate
committee
of
five
substituted
a
fancy
gold
badge
with
suitable
inscriptions
on
both
sides
extolling
him
to
the
skies
long
before
he
went
there
hisself
to
quote
uncle
gideon
luce
whose
bump
of
perception
was
a
stubborn
prophet
when
it
came
to
picking
out
the
site
of
crow
heaven
for
a
full
half
hour
the
marshal
of
tinkletown
had
been
standing
among
the
trees
surveying
the
schoolhouse
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
if
his
frosted
cheeks
and
watery
eyes
ached
for
the
warmth
that
urged
the
curls
of
smoke
to
soar
away
from
the
his
attitude
did
not
betray
the
fact
he
was
watching
and
thinking
and
when
anderson
thought
of
one
thing
he
never
thought
of
another
at
the
same
time
it
soon
be
recess
time
he
reflected
then
i
step
down
there
an
let
on
to
be
makin
a
social
call
on
the
by
gum
i
believe
she
the
one
it
take
some
tarnation
good
work
to
find
out
the
truth
about
her
but
i
guess
i
do
it
all
right
the
only
thing
i
got
to
guard
is
lettin
anybody
else
know
of
the
mystery
surroundin
her
gosh
it
surprise
some
of
the
folks
here
rosalie
an
mebby
the
township
trustee
wo
be
sorry
he
give
the
school
this
year
to
a
strange
girl
instid
o
to
jane
rankin
er
effie
dickens
congressman
ritchey
had
no
business
puttin
his
nose
into
our
affairs
anyhow
no
matter
if
this
here
teacher
is
a
friend
of
his
fambly
he
got
some
kind
a
holt
on
these
here
trustees
gosh
i
like
to
know
what
is
he
jest
wrap
round
his
finger
make
anybody
he
likes
must
be
politics
there
it
recess
i
jest
light
out
an
pay
the
schoolhouse
a
little
visit
inside
a
capacious
and
official
pocket
of
crow
coat
reposed
a
letter
from
a
law
firm
in
chicago
it
asked
if
within
the
last
two
years
a
young
woman
had
applied
for
a
position
as
teacher
in
the
township
schools
at
tinkletown
a
description
accompanied
the
inquiry
but
it
was
admitted
she
might
have
applied
under
a
name
not
her
own
which
was
marion
lovering
in
explanation
the
letter
said
she
had
left
her
home
in
chicago
without
the
consent
of
her
aunt
imbued
with
the
idea
that
she
would
sooner
support
herself
than
depend
upon
the
charity
of
that
worthy
though
wealthy
relative
the
aunt
had
recently
died
and
counsel
for
the
estate
was
trying
to
establish
proof
concerning
the
actions
and
whereabouts
of
miss
lovering
since
her
departure
from
chicago
the
young
woman
often
had
said
she
would
become
a
teacher
a
tutor
a
governess
or
a
companion
and
it
was
known
that
she
had
made
her
way
to
that
section
of
the
world
presided
over
by
anderson
crow
although
the
distinguished
lawyers
did
not
put
it
in
those
words
a
reward
of
five
hundred
dollars
for
positive
information
concerning
the
life
of
the
girl
while
in
that
or
any
other
community
was
promised
miss
banks
appointment
came
through
the
agency
of
the
congressman
in
whose
home
she
had
acted
as
governess
for
a
period
moreover
she
answered
the
description
in
that
she
was
young
pretty
and
refined
anderson
crow
felt
that
he
was
on
the
right
track
he
was
now
engaged
in
as
pretty
a
piece
of
detective
business
as
had
ever
fallen
to
his
lot
and
he
was
not
going
to
spoil
it
by
haste
and
overconfidence
just
why
anderson
crow
should
shadow
the
schoolhouse
instead
of
the
teacher
temporary
place
of
abode
no
one
could
possibly
have
known
but
himself
and
it
is
doubtful
if
knew
he
resolved
not
to
answer
the
chicago
letter
until
he
was
quite
ready
to
produce
the
girl
and
the
proof
desired
i
be
a
fool
to
put
onter
my
an
then
have
cheat
me
out
of
the
reward
he
reflected
keenly
you
cai
trust
them
chicago
lawyers
an
inch
an
a
half
doggone
it
i
never
fergit
that
feller
who
got
my
out
to
central
park
that
time
he
tole
me
positively
he
was
a
lawyer
from
chicago
an
had
an
office
in
the
building
an
the
idee
of
him
tellin
me
he
wanted
to
see
if
my
had
better
leather
in
it
than
hisn
the
fact
that
the
school
children
big
and
little
loved
miss
banks
possessed
no
point
of
influence
over
their
elders
of
the
feminine
persuasion
they
turned
up
their
tinkletown
noses
and
sniffed
at
her
because
she
was
a
vain
creature
who
thought
more
of
attractin
the
men
than
she
did
of
anything
else
on
earth
and
all
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
was
the
intimate
friend
of
the
town
goddess
rosalie
gray
everybody
in
school
no
over
the
age
of
seven
was
deeply
jealously
in
love
with
miss
banks
many
a
frozen
snowball
did
its
deadly
work
from
ambush
because
of
this
impotent
jealousy
but
the
merriest
rivalry
was
that
which
developed
between
ed
higgins
the
beau
brummel
of
tinkletown
and
little
whose
father
owned
the
biggest
farm
in
bramble
county
if
she
was
amused
by
the
frantic
efforts
of
each
suitor
to
outwit
the
other
she
was
too
tactful
to
display
her
emotion
perhaps
she
was
more
highly
entertained
by
the
manner
in
which
tinkletown
femininity
paired
its
venom
with
masculine
admiration
mornin
miss
banks
was
anderson
greeting
as
he
stamped
noisily
into
the
room
he
forgot
that
he
had
said
to
her
when
she
stopped
in
to
see
rosalie
on
her
way
to
the
schoolhouse
the
children
ceased
their
outdoor
game
and
peered
eagerly
through
the
windows
conscious
that
the
visit
of
this
dignitary
was
of
supreme
importance
miss
banks
looked
up
from
the
papers
she
was
correcting
the
pucker
vanishing
from
her
pretty
brow
as
if
by
magic
crow
what
are
you
doing
away
out
here
in
the
country
jimmy
to
a
small
boy
please
close
the
door
anderson
had
left
it
open
and
it
was
a
raw
january
wind
which
followed
him
into
the
room
me
he
murmured
seems
i
ai
got
sense
enough
to
shet
a
door
even
my
wife
says
but
you
do
keer
to
hear
about
that
do
you
oh
i
jest
dropped
in
finally
answering
her
question
he
took
a
bench
near
the
big
stove
and
spread
his
hands
before
the
warmth
lookin
up
a
little
affair
that
all
powerful
chilly
ai
it
very
she
stood
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
stove
puzzled
by
this
unexpected
visit
looking
at
him
with
undisguised
curiosity
ever
been
to
chicago
asked
anderson
suddenly
hoping
to
catch
her
unawares
oh
yes
i
have
lived
there
she
answered
readily
he
shifted
his
legs
twice
and
took
a
hasty
pull
at
his
whiskers
that
what
i
thought
why
do
you
go
back
there
because
i
teaching
school
here

crow
well
i
reckon
that
a
good
excuse
i

brightly
and
with
understanding
oh

an
on
i
do
a
little
detectin
see

badge

suspected
of
a
heinous
crime
she
asked
so
abruptly
that
he
gasped
wo

take
off
your
cap
mr
crow
he
removed
it
sheepishly
lord
no
he
exclaimed
in
confusion

reckon

later
miss
banks
he
restored
his
cap
to
its
accustomed
place
and
was
starting
toward
the
door
a
trifle
dazed
and
bewildered
what
is
it
that
you
wish
to
find
out
mr
crow
she
suddenly
called
to
him
he
halted
and
faced
about
so
quickly
that
his
reply
came
like
a
shot
out
of
a
gun
i
on
the
lookout
fer
a
girl
an
she
be
rich
crowses
if
i
only

dassent

he
went
on
slowly
retracing
his
steps
i
do
want
people
er
her
either
fer
that
matter
to
git
onter
my
scheme
but
you
jest
wait
he
was
standing
very
close
to
her
now
and
looking
her
full
in
the
face
you
sure
you
do
know
anythin
her
why
how
should
i
know
you
told
me
nothing
you
got
purty
good
clothes
fer
a
common
he
flung
at
her
in
an
aggressive
impertinent
tone
but
the
warm
colour
that
swiftly
rose
to
her
cheeks
forced
him
to
recall
his
words
for
he
quickly
tempered
them
with
er
at
least
that
what
all
the
women
folks
say
oh
so
some
one
has
been
talking
about
my
affairs
some
of
your
excellent
women
want
to
know
more
about
me
than
do
git
excited
miss
banks
he
interrupted
the
women
ai
got
anythin
to
do
with
it
i
mean
it
nothin
to
them
i
crow
she
broke
in
if
there
is
anything
you
or
anybody
in
tinkletown
wants
to
know
about
me
you
will
have
to
deduce
it
for
yourself
i
believe
that
is
what
you
call
it
deduce
and
now
crow
recess
is
over
she
said
pointedly
and
crow
shuffled
out
as
the
children
galloped
in
that
evening
ed
higgins
and
little
came
to
call
but
she
excused
herself
because
of
her
correspondence
in
her
little
upstairs
room
she
wrote
letter
after
letter
one
in
particular
being
voluminous
holabird
as
she
passed
her
door
distinctly
heard
her
laugh
aloud
it
was
a
point
to
be
recalled
afterward
with
no
little
consideration
later
she
went
downstairs
cloaked
warmly
for
a
walk
to
the
ed
higgins
was
still
in
the
parlour
talking
to
the
family
he
hastily
put
in
his
petition
to
accompany
her
and
it
was
granted
absently
then
he
surreptitiously
and
triumphantly
glanced
through
the
window
the
scene
outside
pleasing
him
audibly
was
standing
at
the
front
gate
talking
to
anderson
crow
miss
banks
noticed
as
they
passed
the
confused
twain
at
the
gate
that
anderson
carried
his
dark
lantern
any
trace
of
the
heiress
mr
crow
she
asked
merrily
doggone
it
muttered
anderson
she
give
the
whole
snap
away
what
that
asked
nothin
much
said
anderson
repairing
the
damage
ed
got
your
time
beat
that
all
i
could
took
her
out
ridin
if
i
wanted
to
lied

i
was
jest
goin
to
ast
her
mebby
ed
askin
her
now
gosh
dern
it
that
so
maybe
he
is
almost
wailed
and
anderson
felt
sorry
for
him
as
he
ambled
away
from
the
gate
and
its
guardian
chapter
xii
the
young
higgins
found
his
companion
bubbling
over
with
vivacity
her
pretty
chin
was
in
the
air
and
every
word
bore
the
promise
of
a
laugh
he
afterward
recalled
one
little
incident
of
their
walk
through
the
frosty
night
and
repeated
it
to
anderson
crow
with
more
awe
than
seemed
necessary
they
were
passing
the
town
pump
on
their
way
to
the
the
street
was
dark
and
deserted
gosh
said
ed
i
bet
the
town
pump
froze
up
it
does
seem
very
cold
she
said
brightly
gee
it
below
zero
i
bet

it
pretty
doggone
cold
up
there
by
your
gate
poor
his
mother
should
keep
him
indoors
on
nights
like
this
ed
laughed
loud
and
long
and
a
tingle
of
happiness
shot
through
his
erstwhile
shivering
frame
i
not
a
bit
cold
she
went
on
see
feel
my
hand
i
not
even
wearing
mittens
ed
higgins
gingerly
clasped
the
little
hand
but
it
was
withdrawn
at
once
he
found
it
as
warm
as
toast
words
of
love
surged
to
his
humble
lips
his
knees
felt
a
tendency
to
lower
themselves
precipitously
to
the
frozen
sidewalk
he
was
ready
to
grovel
at
her
feet
and
he
wondered
if
they
were
as
warm
as
toast
but
little
came
up
at
that
instant
and
the
chance
was
lost
doggone
slipped
unconsciously
but
bitterly
from
ed
lips
can
i
be
your
company
to
the
night
miss
banks
burst
unceremoniously
from
the
lips
of
the
newcomer

just
wondering
how
i
should
get
out
to
the
schoolhouse

very
kind

with
the
holabirds
doggone
came
in
almost
a
wail
from
poor
ed
he
could
have
killed
for
the
triumphant
laugh
that
followed
in
the
meantime
anderson
crow
was
preparing
to
crawl
in
between
the
icy
sheets
at
home
crow
was
sitting
up
with
old
luce
who
was
ill
next
door

below

right
here
in
this
bed
anderson
crow
soon
slept
but
he
did
not
dream
of
the
tragedy
the
next
night
was
to
bring
upon
tinkletown
nor
of
the
test
his
prowess
was
to
endure
the
next
night
and
the
at
school
no
came
on
apace
together
it
was
bitterly
cold
and
starlight
by
eight
the
warm
schoolhouse
was
comfortably
filled
with
the
spellers
of
the
neighbourhood
their
numbers
increased
by
competitors
from
tinkletown
itself
in
the
crowd
were
men
and
women
who
time
after
time
had
spelled
down
whole
companies
and
who
were
eager
for
the
conflict
they
had
studied
up
on
their
spelling
for
days
in
anticipation
of
a
hard
battle
in
the
words
borum
and
cartwill
both
famous
for
their
victories
and
for
the
rivalry
that
existed
between
them
were
selected
as
captains
of
the
opposing
sides
and
miss
banks
herself
was
to
give
out
the
words
the
captains
selected
their
forces
choosing
alternately
from
the
anxious
crowd
of
grown
folks
there
were
no
children
there
for
it
was
understood
that
big
words
would
be
given
out
words
children
could
not
pronounce
much
less
spell
the
teacher
was
amazingly
pretty
on
this
eventful
night
she
was
dressed
as
no
other
woman
in
bramble
county
except
rosalie
gray
could
have
attired
herself
simply
tastefully
daintily
her
face
was
flushed
and
eager
and
the
joy
of
living
glowed
in
every
feature
ed
higgins
and
little
were
struck
senseless
nerveless
by
this
vision
of
health
and
loveliness
anderson
crow
stealthily
admitted
to
himself
that
she
was
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
she
was
not
of
tinkletown
or
any
place
like
it
just
as
the
captains
were
completing
their
selections
of
spellers
the
door
opened
and
three
strangers
entered
the
overcoated
and
furred
to
the
tips
of
their
noses
two
men
and
a
woman
as
miss
banks
rushed
forward
to
greet
them
she
had
evidently
been
expecting
them
the
startled
assemblage
caught
its
breath
and
stared
to
the
further
amazement
of
every
one
rosalie
hastened
to
her
side
and
joined
in
the
effusive
welcome
every
word
of
joyous
greeting
was
heard
by
the
amazed
listeners
and
every
word
from
the
strangers
was
as
distinct
surely
the
newcomers
were
friends
of
long
standing
when
their
heavy
wraps
were
removed
the
trio
stood
forth
before
as
curious
an
audience
as
ever
sat
spellbound
the
men
were
young
well
dressed
and
handsome
the
woman
a
beauty
of
the
most
dashing
type
tinkletown
best
spellers
quivered
with
excitement
illustration
the
teacher
was
amazingly
pretty
on
this
eventful
night
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
miss
banks
her
voice
trembling
with
eagerness
let
me
introduce
my
friends
farnsworth
farnsworth
and
reddon
they
have
driven
over
to
attend
the
ed
higgins
and
little
observed
with
sinking
hearts
that
it
was
reddon
whom
she
led
forward
by
the
hand
and
they
cursed
him
inwardly
for
the
look
he
gave
her
because
she
blushed
beneath
it
you
do
live
in
boggs
city
remarked
crow
appointing
himself
spokesman
i
deduce
that
you
carrying
satchels
valises
crow
is
a
famous
detective
explained
miss
banks
anderson
attempted
to
assume
an
unconscious
pose
but
in
leaning
back
he
missed
the
end
of
the
bench
and
sat
sprawling
upon
the
lap
of
harbaugh
as
harbaugh
had
little
or
no
lap
to
speak
of
his
downward
course
was
diverted
but
not
stayed
he
landed
on
the
floor
with
a
grunt
that
broke
simultaneously
with
the
lady
squeak
a
fraction
of
a
second
later
a
roar
of
laughter
swept
the
room
it
was
many
minutes
before
quiet
was
restored
and
the
match
could
be
opened
cartwill
chose
farnsworth
and
her
rival
selected
the
husband
of
the
dashing
young
woman
reddon
firmly
and
significantly
announced
his
determination
to
sit
near
the
teacher
to
preserve
order
and
not
enter
the
contest
of
words
possibly
it
was
the
presence
of
the
strangers
that
rattled
and
unnerved
the
famed
spellers
of
both
sides
for
it
was
not
long
until
the
lines
had
dwindled
to
almost
nothing
three
or
four
arrogant
competitors
stood
forth
and
valiantly
spelled
such
words
as
popocatepetl
tschaikowsky
terpsichorean
yseult
and
scores
of
words
that
could
scarcely
be
pronounced
by
the
teacher
herself
but
at
last
just
as
the
sleepy
watchers
began
to
nod
and
yawn
the
hardest
cartwill
stood
alone
and
victorious
her
single
opponent
having
gone
down
on
the
word
sassafras
anderson
crow
had
gone
down
early
in
the
match
by
spelling
kerosene
ed
higgins
followed
with
ceriseen
and
little
explosively
had
it
during
the
turmoil
incident
to
the
dispersing
of
the
gathered
hosts
miss
banks
made
her
way
to
little
side
and
informed
him
that
the
farnsworths
were
to
take
her
to
holabird
in
their
big
sleigh
was
floored
when
he
started
to
remonstrate
claiming
to
be
her
company
big
tom
reddon
interposed
and
drew
miss
banks
away
from
her
lover
wrath
but
i
so
sorry
for
him
tom
she
protested
contritely
he
bring
me
here
in
a
way
well
i
take
you
home
another
way
said
reddon
it
was
also
noticed
that
rosalie
gray
had
much
of
a
confidential
nature
to
say
to
miss
banks
as
they
parted
for
the
evening
she
to
go
home
in
blucher
peabody
new
sleigh
and
ed
higgins
almost
came
to
blows
out
at
the
where
the
latter
began
twitting
his
discomfited
rival
anderson
crow
kept
them
apart
i
kill

he

rakin

him
before
the
night
over

at
least
a
dozen
men
including
alf
reesling
heard
this
threat
and
not
one
of
them
was
to
forget
it
soon
anderson
crow
noticed
that
holabird
drove
away
without
either
miss
banks
or
little
in
its
capacious
depths
miss
banks
announced
that
her
three
friends
from
the
city
and
she
would
stay
behind
and
close
the
schoolhouse
putting
everything
in
order
it
was
friday
night
and
there
would
be
no
session
until
the
following
monday
crow
was
very
sleepy
for
a
detective
he
snored
all
the
way
home
the
next
morning
two
farmers
drove
madly
into
tinkletown
with
the
astounding
news
that
some
one
had
been
murdered
at
schoolhouse
no
in
passing
the
place
soon
after
daybreak
they
had
noticed
blood
on
the
snow
at
the
roadside
the
door
was
half
open
and
they
entered
blood
in
great
quantities
smeared
the
floor
near

sensations
came
thick
and
fast
in
tinkletown
during
the
next
few
hours
investigation
proved
that
little
was
nowhere
to
be
found
he
had
not
returned
to
his
home
after
the
nor
had
he
been
seen
since
holabird
passed
him
in
the
road
on
her
way
home
in
the
in
response
to
her
command
to
climb
in
he
sullenly
said
he
was
going
to
walk
home
by
a
short
cut
through
the
woods
a
farmer
had
seen
the
stylish
farnsworth
sleigh
driving
north
furiously
at
eleven
the
occupants
huddled
in
a
bunch
as
if
to
protect
themselves
from
the
biting
air
the
witness
was
not
able
to
tell
which
was
which
in
the
sleigh
but
he
added
interest
to
the
situation
by
solemnly
asserting
that
one
of
the
persons
in
the
rear
seat
was
bundled
up
more
than
the
rest
and
evidently
was
unable
to
sit
erect
according
to
his
tale
the
figure
was
lying
over
against
the
other
occupant
of
the
seat
he
was
also
positive
that
there
were
three
figures
in
the
front
seat
who
was
the
extra
person
was
the
question
that
flashed
into
the
minds
of
the
listeners
a
small
boy
came
to
the
schoolhouse
at
nine
in
the
morning
with
little
new
derby
hat
he
had
picked
it
up
at
the
roadside
not
far
from
the
schoolhouse
and
in
the
direction
taken
by
the
farnsworth
party
anderson
gave
orders
that
no
word
of
the
catastrophe
be
carried
to
rosalie
who
was
reported
to
be
ill
of
a
fever
the
next
morning
after
the
she
had
a
cough
and
the
doctor
had
said
that
nothing
should
be
said
or
done
to
excite
her
the
crowd
at
the
schoolhouse
grew
larger
as
the
morning
passed
everybody
talked
in
whispers
everybody
was
mystified
beyond
belief
all
eyes
were
turned
to
anderson
crow
who
stood
aloof
pondering
as
he
had
never
pondered
before
in
one
hand
he
held
miss
banks
bloody
handkerchief
and
in
the
other
a
common
school
on
physiology
his
badges
and
stars
fairly
revelled
in
their
own
importance
do
pester
him
with
questions
warned
isaac
porter
addressing
alf
reesling
the
town
drunkard
who
had
just
arrived
but
i
got
something
i
want
to
say
to
him
persisted
alf
eagerly
two
or
three
strong
men
restrained
him
thunderation
alf
whispered
elon
jones
cai

see
he
something
out
you
liable
to
throw
him
clear
off
the
track
if
you
say
a
word
to
him
well
this
is
something
he
oughter
know
almost
whimpered
alf
rubbing
his
frozen
ears
sh
muttered
the
bystanders
and
poor
alf
subsided
he
was
unceremoniously
hustled
into
the
background
as
crow
moved
from
the
window
toward
the
group
gentlemen
said
anderson
gravely
there
is
somethin
wrong
here
it
is
barely
possible
that
this
was
not
news
to
the
crowd
but
with
one
accord
they
collectively
and
severally
exchanged
looks
of
appreciation
i
been
readin
up
a
bit
on

human
body

i
proved
one
thing

the
outer
rim

crow
where

cellar
at
there
ai
none
replied
elon
jones
what
no

where
in
thunder
did
they
hide
the
body
then
there
an
attic
ventured
joe
perkins
a
searching
party
headed
by
anderson
crow
shinned
up
the
ladder
to
the
low
garret
no
trace
of
a
body
was
to
be
found
and
the
searchers
came
down
rather
thankfully
then
under
crow
direction
they
searched
the
wood
piles
the
woods
and
the
fields
for
many
rods
in
all
directions
at
noon
they
congregated
at
the
schoolhouse
alf
reesling
was
there
find
it
said
he
thickly
with
a
cunning
leer
he
had
been
drinking
anderson
was
tempted
to
club
him
half
to
death
but
instead
he
sent
him
home
with
joe
perkins
refusing
absolutely
to
hear
what
the
town
drunkard
had
to
say
well
you
wish
you
listened
to
me
ominously
hiccoughed
alf
and
then
as
a
parting
shot
i
would
tell
you
now
fer
eighteen
dollars
cash
you
go
to
thunder
it
was
but
the
crowd
did
nothing
worse
than
stare
at
the
offender
before
starting
off
on
the
trail
of
the
big
sleigh
anderson
sent
this
message
by
wire
to
the
lawyers
in
chicago
have
found
the
girl
you
want
but
the
body
is
lost
would
you
just
as
soon
have
her
dead
as
anderson
crow
in
a
big
the
marshal
and
a
picked
sextette
of
men
set
off
at
one
on
the
road
over
which
the
sleigh
had
travelled
many
hours
before
anderson
had
failed
to
report
the
suspected
crime
to
the
sheriff
at
boggs
city
and
was
working
alone
on
the
mystery
he
said
he
did
not
want
anybody
from
town
interfering
with
his
affairs
say
andy
anderson
said
harry
squires
now
editor
of
the
maybe
we
hunting
the
wrong
body
and
the
wrong
people
what
do
you
mean
well
ai
little
missing
maybe
he
been
killed
eh
and
say
ai
there
some
chance
that
he
did
the
killing
did
he
say
he
was
going
to
murder
that
city
chap
well
supposing
he
did
we
on
the
wrong
track
ai
we
doggone
you
harry
that
do
fit
in
with
my
deductions
wailed
anderson
i
wish
you
let
me
alone
may
have
done
the
killin
but
it
our
place
to
find
the
body
ai
it
whoever
has
been
slew
was
taken
away
last
night
in
the
sleigh
it
was
reddon
well
consarn
it
ai
he
got
a
body
same
as
anybody
else
we
just
got
to
find
somebody
body
that
all
we
got
to
prove
the
corpus
deelicti
drive
up
bill
with
a
perseverance
that
spoke
well
for
the
detective
endurance
but
ill
for
his
intelligence
the
bob
sped
along
aimlessly
it
was
ridiculous
to
think
of
tracking
a
sleigh
over
a
road
and
it
was
not
until
they
reached
the
that
harry
squires
suggested
that
inquiries
be
made
of
the
farmers
in
the
neighbourhood
after
diligent
effort
a
farmer
was
discovered
who
said
he
had
heard
the
sleigh
bells
at
midnight
and
peering
from
his
window
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
party
turning
south
at
the
jest
as
i
thought
exclaimed
anderson
they
went
south
so
to
skip
boggs
city
boys
they
got
her
body
er
body
er
that
other
feller
body
with
an
they
skootin
down
this
pike
so
to
get
to
the
big
bridge
my
idee
is
that
they
allowed
to
drop
the
body
in
the
river
which
ai
friz
plum
over
gee
we
ai
expected
to
search
all
over
the
bottom
of
the
river
are
we
anderson
shivered
isaac
porter
the
pump
repairer
ai
said
the
leader
but
i
can
deputise
anybody
i
want
to
and
so
they
hurried
on
to
the
bridge
that
crossed
the
river
as
they
stood
silent
awed
and
shivering
on
the
middle
span
staring
down
into
the
black
water
with
its
navy
of
swirling
even
the
heart
of
anderson
crow
chilled
and
grew
faint
boys
he
said
we
lost
the
track
not
even
a
bloodhound
could
track
in
that
water
bloodhound
sniffed
harry
squires
a
hippopotamus
you
mean
they
were
hungry
and
cold
and
they
were
ready
to
turn
homeward
anderson
said
he
guessed
he
turn
the
job
over
to
the
sheriff
and
his
men
plainly
he
was
much
too
hungry
to
do
any
more
trailing
besides
for
more
than
an
hour
he
had
been
thinking
of
the
warm
wood
fire
at
home
bill
rubley
was
putting
the
gad
to
the
horses
when
a
man
on
horseback
rode
up
from
the
opposite
end
of
the
bridge
he
had
come
far
and
in
a
hurry
and
he
recognised
anderson
crow
say
anderson
he
called
somebody

into

it
a

a
hurried
interview
brought
out
the
facts
the
invaders
had
come
up
in
a
big
sleigh
long
before
dawn
and
but
that
was
sufficient
anderson
and
his
men
returned
to
the
hunt
eager
and
sure
of
their
prey
darkness
was
upon
them
when
they
came
in
sight
of

place
in

there
were
lights
in
the
windows
and
people
were
making
merry
indoors
while
outside
the
pursuing

his
men
were
wondering
how
and
where
to

in
gaining
admittance
to

he
had
secreted
his
badge
and
it
was
indeed
a
tramp
who
asked
for
a
bite
to
eat
at
the
kitchen
door
three
or
four
young
women
were
busy
with
chafing
dishes
in
this
department
of
the
house
and
some
young
men
were
looking
on
and
bothering
them
with
attentions
in
the
front
part
of
the
house
a
score
of
people
were
laughing
and
making
merry

of

blankly
is
it
a

no
but
there
will
be
one
before
many
days
it
just
a
reunion
how
i
wish
rosalie

were
here
cried
another
girl
just
then
there
was
a
pounding
on
the
door
and
an
instant
later
isaac
porter
stalked
in
at
the
head
of
the
posse
throw
up
your
hands
called
anderson
addressing
himself
to
the
posse
the
members
of
which
stopped
in
blank
amazement
some
of
them
obligingly
stuck
their
hands
on
high
what
do
you
want
here
we
we
we
lookin
fer
a
tramp
who
said
he
robbed

faltered
isaac
porter
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
called
a
strong
voice
from
the
and
the
flabbergasted
tinkletownians
turned
to
face
colonel
randall
himself
the
owner
of
the
house
derned
if
i
know
muttered
anderson

and
he
spoke
the
truth
why
it
anderson

cried
a
gay
young
voice
jumpin
jehosophat
ejaculated
the
detective
it
the

the
exclaimed
the
surprised
tinkletownians
as
with
their
eyes
they
proceeded
to
search
the
figure
before
them
for
blood
stains
but
no
sooner
had
the
chorused
words
escaped
their
lips
than
they
realised
how
wretchedly
commonplace
was
their
blundering
expression
in
comparison
with
the
faultlessly
professional
phraseology
of
their
leader
and
overwhelmed
with
mortification
the
posse
ached
to
recall
them
for
that
the
correct
technical
term
had
been
applied
by
one
for
years
trained
to
the
vernacular
of
his
calling
was
little
consolation
to
these
sensitive
souls
now
consumed
with
envy
in
the
meantime
the

if
we
may
be
permitted
so
to
designate

before
them
as
pretty
as
a

i
do

rosalie

continued
anderson
quite
regardless
of
the
impatience
of
his
listeners
she
jest
wanted
to
keep
from
answerin
questions
she
jest
regularly
let
everybody
believe
you

been
slaughtered
an
never

a

go

anderson
better
hold
your
horses
cautioned
harry
squires
do
forget
the
body
alive
and
kic
and
stopping
short
in
the
hope
that
his
break
might
escape
the
attention
he
confusedly
substituted
and
here
anderson
jaw
dropped
but
the
movement
was
barely
perceptible
the
discomfiture
temporary
for
to
the
analytical
mind
of
the
great
detective
the
fact
that
a
murder
had
been
committed
was
fully
established
by
the
discovery
of
the
blood
that
a
body
was
obviously
necessary
for
the
continuance
of
further
investigations
he
frankly
acknowledged
to
himself
and
not
for
one
instant
would
any
supposition
or
explanation
other
than
assassination
be
tolerated
and
it
was
with
unshaken
conviction
that
he
declared
well
somebody
was
slew
was
they
that
as
plain
the
nose
on
face
do
you
contradict
me
harry
squires
i
guess
anderson
crow
knows
blood
when
he
sees
it
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
been
trailing
us
all
day
in
the
belief
that
some
one
of
us
had
killed
somebody
demanded
tom
reddon
harry
squires
explained
the
situation
anderson
being
too
far
gone
to
step
into
the
breach
it
may
be
of
interest
to
say
that
the
tinkletown
detective
was
the
sensation
of
the
hour
the
crowd
merry
once
more
lauded
him
to
the
skies
for
the
manner
in
which
the
supposed
culprits
had
been
trailed
and
the
marshal
pomposity
grew
almost
to
the
bursting
point
but
how
about
that
blood
he
demanded
yes
said
harry
squires
with
a
sly
grin
it
was
positively
identified
as
yours
miss
banks
well
it
the
first
time
i
was
ever
fooled
confessed
anderson
glibly
i
have
to
admit
it
the
blood
really
belonged
to
little
boys
the
seegars
are
on
me
no
they
on
me
exclaimed
tom
reddon
producing
a
box
of
perfectos
but
miss
banks
you
are
wanted
in
chicago
insisted
anderson
reddon
interrupted
him
right
you
are
my
dear
sherlock
and
i
going
to
take
her
there
as
soon
as
i
can
it
what
i
came
east
for
ai
i
mean
was
you
miss
lovering
muttered
anderson
crow
good
heavens
no
cried
miss
banks
who
is
she
a
shoplifter
i
tell
you
the
story
crow
if
you
come
with
me
said
farnsworth
stepping
forward
with
a
wink
in
the
library
he
told
the
tinkletown
posse
that
tom
reddon
had
met
miss
banks
while
she
was
at
school
in
new
york
he
was
a
chicago
millionaire
son
and
she
was
the
daughter
of
wealthy
new
york
people
her
mother
was
eager
to
have
the
young
people
marry
but
the
girl
at
that
time
imagined
herself
to
be
in
love
with
another
man
in
a
pique
she
left
school
and
set
forth
to
earn
her
own
living
a
year
hardship
as
governess
in
the
family
of
congressman
ritchey
and
subsequent
disillusionment
as
a
country
brought
her
to
her
senses
and
she
realised
that
she
cared
for
tom
reddon
after
all
she
and
miss
gray
together
prepared
the
letter
which
told
reddon
where
she
could
be
found
and
that
eager
young
gentleman
did
the
rest
he
had
been
waiting
for
months
for
just
such
a
message
from
her
the
night
of
the
he
induced
her
to
come
to
colonel
randall
and
now
the
whole
including
miss
banks
was
to
leave
on
the
following
day
for
new
york
the
marriage
would
take
place
in
a
very
few
weeks
i
accept
your
explanation
said
crow
composedly
as
he
took
a
handful
of
cigars
well
i
guess
i
be
startin
back
it
kind
o
there
was
a
telegram
at
the
livery
stable
for
him
when
he
reached
that
haven
of
warmth
and
rest
in
tinkletown
about
dawn
the
next
day
it
was
from
chicago
and
marked
charges
collect
what
girl
and
whose
body
it
said
do
you
refer
to
miss
lovering
has
been
dead
two
years
and
we
are
settling
the
estate
in
behalf
of
the
other
heirs
we
were
trying
to
establish
her
place
of
residence
never
mind
the
body
you
have
lost
doggone
said
anderson
chuckling
aloud
that
was
an
awful
good
joke
on
was
it
the
stablemen
stood
around
and
looked
at
him
with
jaws
that
were
drooping
helplessly
the
air
seemed
laden
with
a
sombre
uncertainty
that
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
penetrating
the
nature
of
marshal
crow
is
it
from
her
finally
asked
ike
smith
hoarsely
his
lips
trembling
from
what
her
rosalie

it
from
my
lawyers
in
chicago
ai
you

about

half
groaned
ike
moving
away
as
if
he
expected
something
calamitous
what
the
dickens
are
you
fellers
drivin
at
demanded
anderson
the
remainder
of
his
posse
deserted
the
stove
and
drew
near
with
the
instinctive
feeling
that
something
dreadful
had
happened
ro
rosalie
has
been
missin
sence
early
last
night
she
was
grabbed
by
some
feller
near

chucked
into
a

reesling
finally
found
some
one
who
would
listen
to
his
story
he
told
the
minister
and
the
minister
alarmed
the
town
to
be
brief
alf
admitted
that
little
was
at
his
house
in
the
outskirts
of
the
village
laid
up
with
a
broken
arm
and
a
bad
cut
in
the
top
of
his
head
he
came
crawlin
up
to
my
place
about
six
in
the
mornin
explained
alf
an
i
took
the
poor
cuss
in
that
what
i
wanted
to
tell
anderson
but
the
old
rip
would
listen
to
me
seems
as
though
waited
around
the
schoolhouse
last
night
to
git
a
crack
at
that
feller
from
town
miss
banks
and
her
three
friends
set
around
the
stove
in
the
schoolhouse
for
about
an
hour
after
the
crowd
left
an
got
so
cold
he
liked
to
died
out
there
in
the
woodshed
purty
soon
they
all
come
out
an
cut
acrost
the
lot
to
git
inside
the
house
by
the
fire
he
was
so
derned
cold
that
he
did
feel
like
crackin
anybody
when
they
was
lookin
he
sneaked
inside
jest
as
he
was
gittin
ready
to
hug
the
stove
he
heard
miss
banks
an
one
of
the
men
comin
back
he
shinned
up
the
ladder
into
the
garret
just
in
time
in
they
come
an
the
feller
lit
a
lamp
could
hear
talkin
she
said
to
the
schoolhouse
forever
an
the
feller
kissed
her
a
couple
of
times
pretty
nigh
swore
out
loud
at
that
then
she
said
she
leave
a
note
in
her
desk
fer
the
trustees
her
job
er
whatever
she
called
it
he
heard
her
read
the
note
to
the
man
an
it
said
somethin
about
goin
away
unexpected
to
git
married
says
ef
anderson
had
looked
in
the
desk
he
have
found
the
note
then
she
packed
up
some
books
an
her
an
the
feller
went
out
was
paralysed
he
heerd
the
jingle
an
then
he
come
to
he
started
down
the
ladder
so
quick
that
he
missed
his
hold
and
went
kerslam
clear
to
the
bottom
doggone
ef
he
did
light
on
his
head
too
he
do
know
how
long
he
laid
there
but
finally
he
was
resurrected
enough
to
crawl
over
by
the
stove
his
arm
was
broke
an
he
was
bleedin
like
a
stuck
hog
miss
banks
had
left
her
handkerchief
on
the
desk
an
he
says
he
tried
to
bind
up
his
head
with
it
but
it
was
too
infernal
small
somehow
he
got
outside
an
wandered
around
half
crazy
fer
a
long
time
finally
pullin
up
at
my
house
derned
nigh
froze
to
death
an
so
weak
he
could
walk
no
more
he
lost
his
hat
an
his
ear
muffs
an
his
way
all
at
the
same
time
if
anderson
had
let
me
talk
this
mornin
he
knowed
there
was
no
murder
it
was
just
a
match
hours
passed
before
anderson
was
himself
again
and
able
to
comprehend
the
details
of
the
story
which
involved
the
disappearance
of
his
ward
it
slowly
filtered
through
his
mind
as
he
sat
and
numb
before
the
kitchen
fire
that
this
was
the
means
her
mysterious
people
had
taken
to
remove
her
from
his
custody
the
twenty
years
had
expired
and
they
had
come
to
claim
their
own
there
was
gloom
in
the
home
of
anderson
crow
gloom
so
dense
that
death
would
have
seemed
bright
in
comparison
crow
was
prostrated
anderson
in
a
state
of
mental
and
physical
collapse
the
children
hysterical
all
tinkletown
stood
close
and
ministered
dumbly
to
the
misery
of
the
bereaved
ones
but
made
no
effort
to
follow
or
frustrate
the
abductors
the
town
seemed
as
helpless
as
the
marshal
not
willingly
or
wittingly
but
because
it
had
so
long
known
him
as
leader
that
no
one
possessed
the
temerity
to
step
into
his
place
even
in
an
hour
of
emergency
a
dull
state
of
paralysis
fell
upon
the
citizens
big
and
little
it
was
as
if
universal
palsy
had
been
ordained
to
pinch
the
limbs
and
brains
of
tinkletown
until
the
hour
came
for
the
rehabilitation
of
anderson
crow
himself
no
one
suggested
a
move
in
any
direction
in
fact
no
one
felt
like
moving
at
all
everything
stood
stockstill
while
anderson
slowly
pulled
himself
together
everything
waited
dumbly
for
its
own
comatose
condition
to
be
dispelled
by
the
man
who
had
been
hit
the
hardest
it
was
not
until
late
in
the
afternoon
that
blucher
peabody
the
druggist
awoke
from
his
lethargy
and
moved
as
though
he
intended
to
take
the
initiative
blootch
was
rosalie
most
persistent
admirer
he
had
fallen
heir
to
his
father
apothecary
shop
and
notion
store
and
he
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
best
catches
in
town
he
approached
the
crowd
that
huddled
near
old
luce
front
gate
in
this
crowd
were
some
of
the
prominent
men
of
the
town
young
and
old
they
left
their
places
of
business
every
half
hour
or
so
and
wandered
aimlessly
to
the
now
historic
spot
as
if
drawn
by
a
magnet
just
why
they
congregated
there
no
one
could
explain
and
no
one
attempted
to
do
so
presumably
it
was
because
the
whole
town
centred
its
mind
on
one
of
two
places
the
spot
where
rosalie
was
seized
or
the
home
of
anderson
crow
when
they
were
not
at
luce
gate
they
were
tramping
through
anderson
front
yard
and
into
his
house
say
said
blootch
so
loudly
that
the
crowd
felt
like
remonstrating
with
him
what
the
use
of
all
this
no
one
responded
no
one
was
equal
to
it
on
such
short
notice
we
got
to
do
something
besides
stand
around
and
whisper
he
said
we
got
to
find
rosalie
gray
but
good
gosh
ejaculated
isaac
porter
they
got
purty
nigh
a
day
start
of
us
well
that
do
matter
anderson
would
do
as
much
for
us
let
get
a
move
on
but
where
in
thunder
will
we
hunt
murmured
george
ray
to
the
end
of
the
earth
announced
blootch
inflating
his
chest
and
slapping
it
violently
a
strangely
personal
proceeding
which
went
unnoticed
he
had
reached
the
conclusion
that
his
chance
to
be
a
hero
was
at
hand
and
not
to
be
despised
here
was
the
opportunity
to
outstrip
all
of
his
competitors
in
the
race
for
rosalie
favour
it
might
be
confessed
that
with
all
his
good
intentions
his
plans
were
hopelessly
vague
the
group
braced
up
a
little
at
the
sound
of
his
heroic
words
but
the
derned
thing
round
was
the
only
thing
ed
higgins
could
find
to
say
ed
as
fickle
as
the
wind
was
once
more
deeply
in
love
with
rosalie
having
switched
from
miss
banks
immediately
after
the
visit
to
colonel
randall
aw
you
go
to
guinea
was
blootch
insulting
reply
nothing
could
be
more
disparaging
than
that
but
ed
failed
to
retaliate
let
appoint
a
committee
to
wait
on
anderson
and
find
out
what
he
thinks
we
better
do
but
anderson
ai
began
some
one
blootch
calmly
waived
him
into
silence
what
he
wants
is
encouragement
and
not
a
lot
of
soup
and
broth
and
lemonade
he
ai
sick
he
as
as
i
am
every
woman
in
town
took
soup
to
him
this
noon
he
needs
a
good
stiff
drink
of
whiskey
and
a
committee
to
cheer
him
up
i
took
a
bottle
up
to
little
last
night
and
he
acted
like
another
man
at
last
it
was
decided
that
a
committee
should
first
wait
on
anderson
ascertaining
his
wishes
in
the
premises
and
then
proceed
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
the
mystery
in
forming
this
committee
the
wise
men
of
the
town
ignored
peabody
and
he
might
have
been
left
off
completely
had
he
not
stepped
in
and
appointed
himself
chairman
the
five
good
men
and
true
descended
upon
the
marshal
late
in
the
afternoon
half
fearful
of
the
result
but
resolute
they
found
him
slowly
emerging
from
his
spell
of
lassitude
he
greeted
them
with
a
solemn
nod
of
the
head
since
early
morning
he
had
been
conscious
of
a
long
stream
of
sympathisers
passing
through
the
house
but
it
was
not
until
now
that
he
felt
equal
to
the
task
of
recognising
any
of
them
his
son
roscoe
had
just
finished
telling
him
the
story
of
the
abduction
roscoe
awestruck
tones
and
reddened
eyes
carried
great
weight
with
them
and
for
the
tenth
time
that
day
he
had
his
sisters
in
tears
with
each
succeeding
repetition
the
details
grew
until
at
last
there
was
but
little
of
the
original
event
remaining
a
fact
which
his
own
family
properly
overlooked
gentlemen
said
anderson
as
if
suddenly
coming
from
a
trance
this
was
the
work
of
tinkletown
desperadoes
whereupon
the
committee
felt
mightily
relieved
the
marshal
displayed
signs
of
a
returning
energy
that
augured
well
for
the
enterprise
after
the
chairman
had
impressively
announced
that
something
must
be
done
and
that
he
was
willing
to
lead
his
little
band
to
death
door
and
beyond
if
necessary
crow
pathetically
upset
all
their
hopes
by
saying
that
he
had
long
been
expecting
such
a
calamity
and
that
nothing
could
be
done
they
took
the
very
night
when
i
was
not
here
to
pertect
her
he
lamented
it
shows
that
they
been
me
all
along
the
job
was
did
by
persons
who
was
in
the
employ
of
her
family
an
she
has
been
carried
off
secretly
to
keep
me
from
findin
out
who
and
what
her
parents
were
do
ye
see
her
mother
or
father
fer
that
matter
could
afford
to
come
right
out
plain
an
say
they
wanted
their
child
after
all
these
years
the
only
way
was
to
take
her
away
without
givin
themselves
away
it
been
the
plan
all
along
there
ai
no
use
huntin
fer
her
gentlemen
she
in
new
york
by
this
time
an
maybe
she
ready
fer
a
trip
to
europe
but
i
should
think
she
telegraph
to
you
said
blootch
telegraph
yer
granny
do
you
they
stole
her
if
they
intended
to
let
her
telegraph
to
anybody
not
much
they
her
away
until
her
estate
settled
after
a
while
it
will
all
come
out
an
you
see
if
i
ai
right
but
she
gone
they
got
her
away
from
me
an
an
we
got
to
stand
it
that
all
i
i
cai
bear
to
think
about
it
it
broke
my
heart
mighty
ne
near
do
mind
me
if
i
cry
boys
you
would
too
if
you
was
me
as
the
committee
departed
soon
after
without
any
plan
of
action
arising
from
the
interview
with
the
dejected
marshal
it
may
be
well
to
acquaint
the
reader
with
the
history
of
the
abduction
as
told
by
roscoe
crow
and
his
bosom
friend
bud
long
thoroughly
expurgated
according
to
instructions
no
one
in
the
crow
family
mentioned
the
strange
disappearance
of
elsie
banks
to
rosalie
nor
was
she
told
of
the
pursuit
by
the
marshal
and
his
posse
the
girl
far
from
being
afflicted
with
a
fever
really
now
kept
in
her
room
by
grief
over
the
departure
of
her
friend
and
companion
she
was
in
tears
all
that
night
and
the
next
day
suffering
intensely
in
her
loss
rosalie
did
not
know
that
the
teacher
was
to
leave
tinkletown
surreptitiously
until
after
the
the
sly
blushing
announcement
came
as
a
shock
but
she
was
loyal
to
her
friend
and
not
a
word
in
exposure
escaped
from
her
lips
of
course
she
knew
nothing
of
the
sensational
developments
that
followed
the
flight
of
elsie
banks
shortly
after
the
supper
dishes
had
been
cleared
away
rosalie
came
downstairs
and
announced
that
she
was
going
over
to
read
to
old
luce
who
was
bedridden
her
guardian
absence
was
not
explained
to
her
and
she
did
not
in
the
least
suspect
that
he
had
been
away
all
day
on
a
fool
errand
roscoe
and
bud
accompanied
her
to
luce
front
door
heavily
bound
by
promises
to
hold
their
tongues
regarding

anderson

a
big
sleigh
turned
out

anderson
then
they
whipped
up
an
turned
off
west
in
the
pike
resumed
bud
we
run
all
the
way
home
an
tole
lamson
an
he
where

rosalie
all
this
time

anderson

hopelessly
chapter
xvi
the
haunted
house
days
passed
without
word
or
sign
from
the
missing
girl
the
marshal
haunted
the
and
the
railroad
station
hoping
with
all
his
poor
old
heart
that
word
would
come
from
her
but
the
letter
was
not
there
nor
was
there
a
telegram
at
the
station
when
he
strolled
over
to
that
place
the
county
officials
at
boggs
city
came
down
and
began
a
cursory
investigation
but
anderson
emphatic
though
doleful
opinions
set
them
quite
straight
and
they
gave
up
the
quest
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
sit
back
and
wait
in
those
three
days
anderson
crow
turned
greyer
and
older
although
he
maintained
a
splendid
show
of
resignation
he
had
made
a
perfunctory
offer
of
reward
for
rosalie
dead
or
alive
but
he
knew
all
the
time
that
it
would
be
fruitless
mark
riley
the
stuck
up
the
glaring
reward
notices
as
far
away
as
the
telegraph
poles
in
clay
county
the
world
was
given
to
understand
that
reward
would
be
paid
for
rosalie
return
or
for
information
leading
to
the
apprehension
and
capture
of
her
abductors
there
was
one
very
mysterious
point
in
connection
with
the
affair
something
so
strange
that
it
bordered
on
the
supernatural
no
human
being
in
bramble
county
except
the
two
boys
had
seen
the
sleigh
it
had
disappeared
as
if
swallowed
by
the
earth
itself
well
it
do
do
any
good
to
cry
over
spilt
milk
said
anderson
bravely
she
gone
an
i
only
hope
she
ai
bein
mistreated
i
do
see
why
they
should
harm
her
she
never
done
nobody
a
wrong
like
as
not
she
been
taken
to
a
comfortable
place
in
new
york
we
hear
from
her
as
soon
as
she
recovers
from
the
shock
there
no
use
huntin
fer
her
i
know
but
i
jest
ca
help
nosin
around
a
little
mebby
i
can
git
some
track
of
her
i
give
all
i
got
in
this
world
to
know
that
she
safe
an
sound
no
matter
if
i
never
see
her
the
hungry
look
in
his
eyes
deepened
and
no
one
bandied
jests
with
him
as
was
the
custom
in
days
gone
by
there
were
not
many
tramps
practising
in
that
section
of
the
state
anderson
crow
proudly
announced
that
they
gave
tinkletown
a
wide
berth
because
of
his
prowess
but
the
vagabond
gentry
took
an
entirely
different
view
of
the
question
they
did
not
infest
the
upper
part
of
the
state
for
the
simple
but
eloquent
reason
that
it
meant
starvation
to
them
the
farmers
compelled
the
weary
wayfarer
to
work
all
day
like
a
borrowed
horse
for
a
single
meal
at
the
second
table
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
as
it
is
known
in
the
tramp
vocabulary
it
is
not
extraordinary
therefore
that
tramps
found
the
community
so
unattractive
that
they
cheerfully
walked
miles
to
avoid
it
a
peculiarly
vagrant
once
characterised
the
farmer
as
being
so
close
that
he
never
shaved
because
it
was
a
waste
of
hair
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
state
in
view
of
the
attitude
of
both
farmer
and
tramp
that
the
misguided
vagrant
who
wandered
that
way
was
the
object
of
distinct
if
not
distinguished
curiosity
in
the
country
roads
he
was
stared
at
with
a
malevolence
that
chilled
his
appetite
no
matter
how
long
he
had
been
cultivating
it
on
barren
soil
in
the
streets
of
tinkletown
and
even
at
the
county
seat
he
was
an
object
of
such
amazing
concern
that
he
slunk
away
in
pure
distress
it
was
indeed
an
unsophisticated
tramp
who
thought
to
thrive
in
bramble
county
even
for
a
day
and
a
night
in
front
of
the
general
store
and
at
tinkletown
there
was
a
on
which
anderson
crow
had
painted
these
words
no
tramps
or
live
stock
allowed
on
these
streets
by
order
of
a
crow
marshal
the
live
stock
disregarded
the
command
but
the
tramp
took
warning
on
rare
occasions
he
may
have
gone
through
some
of
the
houses
in
tinkletown
but
if
he
went
through
the
streets
no
one
was
the
wiser
anderson
crow
solemnly
but
studiously
headed
him
off
in
the
outskirts
and
he
took
another
direction
twice
in
his
career
he
drove
out
tramps
who
had
burglarised
the
houses
of
prominent
citizens
in
broad
daylight
but
what
did
it
matter
so
long
as
the
hoboes
were
kept
from
desecrating
the
main
street
of
the
town
crow
official
star
together
with
his
badge
from
the
new
york
detective
agency
his
sons
of
the
revolution
pin
and
his
insignia
made
him
a
person
to
be
feared
if
the
weather
became
too
hot
for
coat
and
vest
the
proud
dignitary
fastened
the
badges
to
his
suspenders
and
their
presence
glorified
the
otherwise
humble
galluses
on
the
fourth
day
after
the
abduction
marshal
crow
was
suddenly
aroused
from
his
lethargy
by
the
news
that
the
peace
and
security
of
the
neighbourhood
was
being
imposed
upon
the
dickens
you
say
he
observed
abandoning
the
perpetual
grip
upon
his
straggling
chin
whiskers
yes
sir
responded
the
excited
small
boy
who
with
two
companions
had
run
himself
quite
out
of
breath
all
over
town
before
he
found
the
officer
at
harkin
blacksmith
shop
well
dang
said
crow
impressively
we
was
skatin
in
the
marsh
when
we
heerd
plain
as

said
the
other
boy

mile
past
his
own
house
before
he
could
stop
he
was
in
sech
a
hurry
to
git
away
from
the
place
but
jim
did
anything
besides
that
was
twenty
year
ago
ghosts

a
place
when
there
ai
nothin
to
her
was
hung
an
she
ai
got
no
one
else
to
pester
i
tell
you
tramps
well
we
just
thought
we
tell
you
crow
said
the
first
boy
in
a
few
minutes
it
was
known
throughout
the
business
centre
of
tinkletown
that
tramps
were
making
their
home
in
the
haunted
house
down
the
river
and
that
anderson
crow
was
to
ride
forth
on
his
bicycle
to
rout
them
out
the
haunted
house
was
three
miles
from
town
and
in
the
most
desolate
section
of
the
bottomland
it
was
approachable
only
through
the
treacherous
swamp
on
one
side
or
by
means
of
the
river
on
the
other
not
until
after
the
murder
of
its
owner
and
builder
old
johanna
rank
was
there
an
explanation
offered
for
the
existence
of
a
home
in
such
an
unwholesome
locality
federal
authorities
discovered
that
she
and
her
dave
wolfe
were
at
the
head
of
a
great
counterfeiting
gang
and
that
they
had
been
working
up
there
in
security
for
years
turning
out
spurious
coins
by
the
hundred
one
night
dave
up
and
killed
his
and
was
hanged
for
his
good
deed
before
he
could
be
punished
for
his
bad
ones
for
thirty
years
the
ramshackle
old
cabin
in
the
swamp
had
been
unoccupied
except
by
birds
lizards
and
other
denizens
of
the
solitude
always
of
course
including
the
ghost
of
old
rank
inasmuch
as
dave
chopped
her
into
small
bits
and
buried
them
in
the
cellar
while
her
own
daughter
held
the
lantern
it
was
not
beyond
the
range
of
possibility
that
certain
atoms
of
the
unlamented
johanna
were
never
unearthed
by
the
searchers
it
was
generally
believed
in
the
community
that
rank
spirit
came
back
every
little
while
to
nose
around
in
the
dirt
of
the
cellar
in
quest
of
such
portions
of
her
person
as
had
not
been
respectably
interred
in
the
village
graveyard
mysterious
noises
had
been
heard
about
the
place
at
the
dead
hour
of
night
and
ghostly
lights
had
flitted
past
the
cellar
windows
all
tinkletown
agreed
that
the
place
was
haunted
and
kept
at
a
most
respectful
distance
the
three
small
boys
who
startled
marshal
crow
from
his
moping
had
gone
down
the
river
to
skate
instead
of
going
to
school
they
swore
that
the
sound
of
muffled
voices
came
from
the
interior
of
the
cabin
near
which
they
had
inadvertently
wandered
although
dave
wolfe
had
been
dead
thirty
years
one
of
the
youngest
of
the
lads
was
positive
that
he
recognised
the
voice
of
the
desperado
and
at
once
the
trio
fled
the
spot
and
brought
the
horrifying
news
to
anderson
crow
the
detective
was
immediately
called
upon
to
solve
the
ghostly
mystery
marshal
crow
first
went
to
his
home
and
donned
his
blue
coat
transferring
the
stars
and
badges
to
the
greasy
lapel
of
the
garment
he
also
secured
his
dark
lantern
and
the
official
cane
of
the
village
but
why
he
should
carry
a
cane
on
a
bicycle
expedition
was
known
only
to
himself
followed
by
a
horde
of
small
boys
and
a
few
representative
citizens
of
tinkletown
on
antiquated
wheels
crow
pedalled
majestically
off
to
the
south
skirting
the
swamp
the
party
approached
the
haunted
house
over
the
narrow
path
which
ran
along
the
river
bank
once
in
sight
of
the
dilapidated
cabin
which
seemed
to
slink
farther
and
farther
back
into
the
dense
shadows
of
the
late
afternoon
with
all
the
diffidence
of
the
supernatural
the
marshal
called
a
halt
and
announced
his
plans
you
kids

an
tell

porter
edging
away
with
his
bicycle
it
was
now
quite
dark
and
menacing
in
there
where
the
cabin
stood
as
the
outcome
of
half
an
discussion
the
whole
party
advanced
slowly
upon
the
house
anderson
crow
in
the
lead
his
dark
lantern
in
one
hand
his
cane
in

and
he
would
have
started
for
home
had
not
isaac
porter
uttered
a
fearful
groan
and
staggered
back
against
a
swamp
reed
for
support
his
horrified
eyes
glued
upon
a
window
in
the
log
house
the
reed
was
inadequate
and
isaac
tumbled
over
backward
for
a
full
minute
the
company
stared
dumbly
at
the
indistinct
little
window
paralysis
attacking
every
sense
but
that
of
sight
at
the
expiration
of
another
minute
the
place
was
deserted
and
anderson
crow
was
the
first
to
reach
the
bicycles
far
up
the
river
bank
every
face
was
as
white
as
chalk
and
every
voice
trembled
crow
dignity
asserted
itself
just
as
the
valiant
posse
prepared
to
straddle
the
wheels
in
mad
flight

panted
i

faltered
uncle
jimmy
borton
who
had
always
said
there
was
let
go
there
ouch
the
command
and
subsequent
exclamation
were
the
inevitable
results
of
his
unsuccessful
attempt
to
mount
with
elon
jones
the
same
wheel
what
i
tell

anderson
exclaimed
isaac
porter

the
time
what
air
we
goin
to
do
next
even
the
valiant
crow
approved
of
an
immediate
return
to
tinkletown
and
the
posse
was
trying
to
disentangle
its
collection
of
bicycles
when
an
interruption
came
from
an
unsuspected
quarter
a
deep
masculine
voice
arose
from
the
river
hard
by
almost
directly
below
that
section
of
the
bank
on
which
anderson
and
his
friends
were
herded
the
result
was
startling
every
man
leaped
a
foot
in
the
air
and
every
hair
stood
on
end
bicycles
rattled
and
clashed
together
and
ed
higgins
hopelessly
bewildered
started
to
run
in
the
direction
of
the
haunted
house
chapter
xvii
wicker
bonner
harvard
hello
up
there
was
what
the
deep
masculine
voice
shouted
from
the
river
anderson
crow
was
the
first
to
distinguish
the
form
of
the
speaker
and
he
was
not
long
in
deciding
that
it
was
far
from
with
a
word
of
command
he
brought
his
disorganised
forces
out
of
chaos
and
huddled
them
together
as
if
to
resist
attack
what
the
matter
with
you
he
demanded
addressing
his
men
in
a
loud
tone
do
get
rattled
are
you
speaking
to
me
called
the
fresh
voice
from
below
who
are
you
demanded
crow
in
return
nobody
in
particular
what
going
on
up
there
what
the
fuss
come
up
an
find
out
then
crow
observing
that
the
man
below
was
preparing
to
comply
turned
and
addressed
his
squad
in
low
earnest
tones
this
feller
will
bear
watchin
he
mixed
up
in
this
thing
somehow
else
why
is
he
wanderin
around
here
close
to
the
house
question
him
by
gosh
he
ai
no
ghost
murmured
ed
higgins
eyeing
the
newcomer
as
he
crawled
up
the
bank
say
did
y
see
me
a
minute
ago
if

come

goin
right
up

search

house
from
top
to
bottom
was
you
all
askeered
to
come
aw
you
said
anderson
crow
in
deep
scorn
the
next
instant
a
stalwart
young
fellow
stood
before
the
marshal
who
was
eyeing
him
keenly
even
imperiously
the
newcomer
face
was
lighted
up
by
a
smile
of
surpassing
friendliness
it
lonesome
as
thunder
down
here
is
it
glad
to
see
you
gentlemen
what

a
bicycle
race

anderson

diplomatically

if
you
are
let
me
in
on
it
i
dying
for
excitement
the
young
man
face
was
eager
and
his
voice
rang
true
besides
he
was
a
tall
athletic
chap
with
brawny
arms
and
a
broad
back
altogether
he
would
make
a
splendid
recruit
thought
anderson
crow
he
was
dressed
in
rough
corduroy
knickerbockers
the
thick
coat
buttoned
up
close
to
his
muffled
neck
a
woollen
cap
came
down
over
his
ears
and
a
pair
of
skates
dangled
from
his
arm

said
bonner
with
a
dry
smile
from
boston
however
sure
interposed
isaac
porter
that
where
the
beans
come
from
anderson
well
that
neither
here
nor
there
said
crow
hastily
changing
the
subject
we
wastin
time
stayin
here
you
mean
asked
ed
higgins
quite
ready
to
start
involuntarily
the
eyes
of
the
posse
turned
toward
the
house
among
the
willows
the
stranger
saw
the
concerted
glance
and
made
inquiry
whereupon
crow
assisted
by
seven
men
and
five
small
boys
told
wicker
bonner
late
of
harvard
what
had
brought
them
from
tinkletown
to
the
haunted
house
and
what
they
had
seen
upon
their
arrival
young
bonner
face
glowed
with
the
joy
of
excitement
great
he
cried
fastening
his
happy
eyes
upon
the
hated
thing
among
the
trees
let
search
the
place
by
george
this
is
glorious
not
on
your
life
said
ed
higgins
you
ca
get
me
inside
that
house
like
as
not
a
feller
never
come
out
alive
well
better
men
than
we
have
died
said
bonner
tranquilly
come
on
i
go
in
first
it
all
about
the
place
being
haunted
in
any
event
ghosts
do
monkey
around
at
this
time
of
day
hardly
dusk
but
gosh
dern
it
exploded
anderson
crow
we
seen
it
i
seen
it
first
said
isaac
porter
proudly
but
i
heerd
it
first
peeped
up
master
bud
you
all
been
drinking
hard
cider
or
pop
or
something
like
that
said
the
brawny
scoffer
now
see
here
you
gittin
fresh
an
began
the
marshal
swelling
up
like
a
pigeon
look
out
behind
sang
out
bonner
and
anderson
jumped
almost
out
of
his
shoes
besides
ripping
his
shirt
in
the
back
he
turned
so
suddenly
jeemses
river
he
gasped
never
turn
your
back
on
an
unknown
danger
cautioned
the
young
man
serenely
be
ready
to
meet
it
if
you
turned
way
you
git
a
quicker
start
if
you
want
to
run
suggested
jim
borum
bracing
himself
with
a
fresh
chew
of
tobacco
what
time
is
it
asked
wicker
bonner
anderson
crow
squinted
up
through
the
leafless
treetops
toward
the
setting
sun
then
he
looked
at
the
shadow
of
a
sapling
down
on
the
bank
it
about
seven
minutes
past
five
in
the
evenin
he
said
conclusively
bonner
was
impolite
enough
to
pull
out
his
watch
for
verification
you
a
minute
fast
he
observed
but
he
looked
at
anderson
with
a
new
and
respectful
admiration
he
detect
anything
under
the
sun
said
porter
with
a
feeble
laugh
at
his
own
joke
well
let
go
up
and
ransack
that
old
cabin
announced
bonner
starting
toward
the
willows
the
crowd
held
back
i
go
alone
if
you
afraid
to
come
he
went
on
it
my
firm
belief
that
you
see
anything
and
the
noise
you
boys
heard
was
the
wind
whistling
through
the
trees
now
tell
the
truth
how
many
of
you
saw
it
i
did
came
from
every
throat
so
unanimously
that
jim
supplemental
oath
stood
out
alone
and
forceful
as
a
climax
then
it
worth
investigating
announced
the
boston
man
it
is
certainly
a
very
mysterious
affair
and
you
at
least
town
marshal
should
back
me
up
in
the
effort
to
unravel
it
tell
me
again
just
what
it
was
you
saw
and
what
it
looked
like
i
wo
let
no
man
tell
me
what
my
duties
are
snorted
anderson
his
stars
trembling
with
injured
pride
of
course
i
going
to
solve
the
mystery
we
got
to
see
what
inside
that
house
i
thought
it
was
tramps
at
first
well
lead
on
then
i
follow
said
bonner
with
a
grin
i
thought
you
was
so
anxious
to
go
first
exclaimed
anderson
with
fine
tact
go
ahead
yourself
ef
you
so
derned
brave
i
dare
you
to
bonner
laughed
loud
enough
to
awaken
every
ghost
in
bramble
county
and
then
strode
rapidly
toward
the
house
anderson
crow
followed
slowly
and
the
rest
straggled
after
all
alert
for
the
first
sign
of
resistance
i
wish
i
could
find
that
derned
lantern
said
anderson
searching
diligently
in
the
deep
grass
as
he
walked
along
in
the
meantime
permitting
bonner
to
reach
the
grim
old
doorway
far
in
advance
of
him
come
on
called
back
the
intrepid
leader
seeing
that
all
save
the
marshal
had
halted
you
do
need
the
lantern
it
still
daylight
old
chap
we
find
out
what
it
was
you
all
saw
in
the
window
that
the
last
of
him
muttered
isaac
porter
as
the
broad
back
disappeared
through
the
low
aperture
that
was
called
a
doorway
there
were
no
window
sashes
or
panes
in
the
house
and
the
door
had
long
since
rotted
from
the
hinges
he
never
come
out
let
go
home
added
ed
higgins
conclusively
are
you
coming
sang
out
bonner
from
the
interior
of
the
house
his
voice
sounded
prophetically
sepulchral
consarn
it
cai
you
wait
a
minute
replied
anderson
crow
still
bravely
but
consistently
looking
for
the
dark
lantern
it
all
right
in
here
there
has
been
a
human
being
in
the
house
for
years
come
on
in
it
fine
anderson
crow
finally
ventured
up
to
the
doorway
and
peeped
in
bonner
was
standing
near
the
tumbledown
fireplace
placidly
lighting
a
cigarette
this
is
a
fine
job
you
put
up
on
me
he
growled
i
thought
there
would
be
something
doing
there
is
a
soul
here
and
there
been
either
thunderation
man
you
cai
see
ghosts
when
they
do
want
you
to
said
anderson
crow
it
was
a
ghost
that
settled
i
knowed
it
all
the
time
nothin
human
ever
looked
like
it
and
nothin
alive
ever
moaned
like
it
did
by
this
time
the
rest
of
the
party
had
reached
the
cabin
door
the
less
timorous
ventured
inside
while
others
contented
themselves
by
looking
through
the
small
windows
well
if
you
sure
you
really
saw
something
we
better
make
a
thorough
search
of
the
house
and
the
grounds
said
bonner
and
forthwith
began
nosing
about
the
two
rooms
the
floors
were
shaky
and
the
place
had
the
odour
of
decayed
wood
mould
clung
to
the
walls
cobwebs
matted
the
ceilings
and
rotted
fungi
covered
the
filth
in
the
corners
altogether
it
was
a
most
uninviting
hole
in
which
no
ghost
would
have
made
its
home
when
the
time
came
to
climb
up
to
the
little
garret
followers
rebelled
he
was
compelled
to
go
alone
carrying
the
lantern
which
one
of
the
small
boys
had
found
this
part
of
the
house
was
even
more
loathsome
than
below
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
its
condition
he
saw
no
sign
of
life
and
retired
in
utter
disgust
then
came
the
trip
to
the
cellar
again
he
had
no
followers
the
tinkletown
men
emphatically
refusing
to
go
down
where
old
rank
body
had
been
buried
bonner
laughed
at
them
and
went
down
alone
it
was
nauseous
with
age
and
the
smell
of
damp
earth
but
it
was
cleaner
there
than
above
stairs
the
cellar
was
smaller
than
either
of
the
living
rooms
and
was
to
be
reached
only
through
the
kitchen
there
was
no
exit
leading
directly
to
the
exterior
of
the
house
but
there
was
one
small
window
at
the
south
end
bonner
examined
the
room
carefully
and
then
rejoined
the
party
for
some
reason
the
posse
had
retired
to
the
open
air
as
soon
as
he
left
them
to
go
below
no
one
knew
exactly
why
but
when
one
started
to
go
forth
the
others
followed
with
more
or
less
alacrity
did
you
see
anything
demanded
the
marshal
what
did
old
rank
look
like
when
she
was
alive
asked
bonner
with
a
beautifully
mysterious
air
no
one
answered
but
there
was
a
sudden
shifting
of
feet
backward
while
an
expression
of
alarmed
inquiry
came
into
every
face
do
back
into
that
open
well
warned
the
amused
young
man
in
the
doorway
anderson
crow
looked
sharply
behind
and
flushed
indignantly
when
he
saw
that
the
well
was
at
least
fifty
feet
away
i
saw
something
down
there
that
looked
like
a
woman
toe
went
on
bonner
very
soberly
good
lord
what
did
i
tell
you
cried
the
marshal
turning
to
his
friends
to
the
best
of
their
ability
they
could
not
remember
that
anderson
had
told
them
anything
but
with
one
accord
the
whole
party
nodded
approval
i
fancy
it
was
the
ghost
of
a
toe
however
for
when
i
tried
to
pick
it
up
it
wriggled
away
and
i
think
it
chuckled
it
disappear
what
the
matter
where
are
you
going
it
is
only
necessary
to
state
that
the
marshal
and
his
posse
retreated
in
good
order
to
a
distant
spot
where
it
was
not
quite
so
dark
there
to
await
the
approach
of
wicker
bonner
who
leisurely
but
laughingly
inspected
the
exterior
of
the
house
and
the
grounds
adjoining
finding
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
except
as
to
dilapidation
he
rejoined
the
party
with
palpable
displeasure
in
his
face
well
i
think
i
go
back
to
the
ice
he
said
that
place
is
as
quiet
as
the
grave
you
are
a
fine
lot
of
jokers
and
i
admit
that
the
laugh
is
on
me
but
bonner
was
mystified
uncertain
he
had
searched
the
house
thoroughly
from
top
to
bottom
and
he
had
seen
nothing
unusual
but
these
men
and
boys
were
so
positive
that
he
could
not
believe
the
eyes
of
all
had
been
deceived
this
interests
me
he
said
at
last
i
tell
you
what
we
do
crow
you
and
i
will
come
down
here
rig
up
a
tent
of
some
sort
and
divide
watch
until
morning
if
there
is
anything
to
be
seen
find
out
what
it
is
i
get
a
couple
of
straw
mattresses
from
our
boathouse
and
i
got
rheumatiz
bonner
an
it
would
be
the
death
o
me
to
sleep
in
this
swamp
objected
anderson
hastily
well
i
come
alone
then
i
not
afraid
i
do
mean
to
say
sleep
in
that
old
shack
but
i
bunk
out
here
in
the
woods
no
human
being
could
sleep
in
that
place
will
any
one
volunteer
to
keep
me
company
silence
i
do
blame
you
it
does
take
nerve
i
confess
my
only
stipulation
is
that
you
shall
come
down
here
from
the
village
early
morning
i
may
have
something
of
importance
to
tell
you
mr
crow
we
find
his
dead
body
groaned
old
borton
say
mister
piped
up
a
shrill
voice
i
stay
with
you
it
was
bud
who
spoke
and
all
tinkletown
was
afterward
to
resound
with
stories
of
his
bravery
the
boy
had
been
silently
admiring
the
bold
sportsman
from
boston
town
and
he
was
ready
to
cast
his
lot
with
him
in
this
adventure
he
thrilled
with
pleasure
when
the
big
hero
slapped
him
on
the
back
and
called
him
the
only
man
in
the
crowd
at
eight
that
night
bonner
and
the
determined
but
trembling
bud
came
up
the
bank
from
the
river
and
pitched
a
tent
among
the
trees
near
the
haunted
house
from
the
sledge
on
the
river
below
they
trundled
up
their
bedding
and
their
stores
bud
had
an
old
shotgun
a
knife
and
a
pipe
which
he
was
just
learning
to
smoke
bonner
brought
a
navajo
blanket
a
revolver
and
a
heavy
walking
stick
he
also
had
a
large
flask
of
whiskey
and
the
pipe
that
had
graduated
from
harvard
with
him
at
nine
he
put
to
bed
in
one
of
the
chilly
nests
a
very
sick
boy
who
hated
to
admit
that
the
pipe
was
too
strong
for
him
but
who
felt
very
much
relieved
when
he
found
himself
wrapped
snugly
in
the
blankets
with
his
head
tucked
entirely
out
of
sight
bud
had
spent
the
hour
in
regaling
bonner
with
the
story
of
rosalie
gray
abduction
and
his
own
heroic
conduct
in
connection
with
the
case
he
confessed
that
he
had
knocked
one
of
the
villains
down
but
they
were
too
many
for
him
bonner
listened
politely
and
then
put
the
hero
to
bed
bonner
dozed
off
at
midnight
an
hour
or
so
later
he
suddenly
sat
bolt
upright
wide
awake
and
alert
he
had
the
vague
impression
that
he
was
deathly
cold
and
that
his
hair
was
standing
on
end
chapter
xviii
the
men
in
the
sleigh
let
us
go
back
to
the
night
on
which
rosalie
was
seized
and
carried
away
from
luce
front
gate
despite
the
valiant
resistance
of
her
youthful
defenders
rosalie
had
drooned
thackeray
to
the
old
lady
until
both
of
them
were
dozing
and
it
was
indeed
a
welcome
relief
that
came
with
resounding
thumps
on
the
front
door
luce
was
too
old
to
be
frightened
out
of
a
year
growth
but
it
is
perfectly
safe
to
agree
with
her
that
the
noise
cost
her
at
least
three
months
desperately
blue
over
the
defection
of
elsie
banks
rosalie
had
found
little
to
make
her
evening
cheerful
indoors
but
the
fresh
crisp
air
set
her
spirits
bounding
the
instant
she
closed
luce
door
from
the
outside
we
have
only
to
refer
to
roscoe
lively
narrative
for
proof
of
what
followed
almost
instantly
she
was
seized
her
head
tightly
wrapped
in
a
thick
cloak
or
blanket
then
she
was
thrown
into
a
sleigh
and
knew
nothing
more
except
a
smothering
sensation
and
the
odour
of
chloroform
when
she
regained
consciousness
she
was
lying
on
the
ground
in
the
open
air
dark
night
about
her
three
men
were
standing
nearby
but
there
was
no
vehicle
in
sight
she
tried
to
rise
but
on
account
of
her
bonds
was
powerless
to
do
so
speech
was
prevented
by
the
cloth
which
closed
her
lips
tightly
after
a
time
she
began
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
muttered
words
that
passed
between
the
men
you
got
the
rig
in
all
right
bill
you
sure
that
no
one
heard
or
saw
you
were
the
first
questions
she
could
make
out
evidently
arising
from
a
previous
report
or
explanation
sure
everybody
in
these
parts
goes
to
bed
at
sundown
they
ai
got
nothing
to
do
but
sleep
up
nobody
knows
we
had
that
feller
sleigh
an
horses
out
nobody
ever
will
know
said
the
big
man
evidently
the
leader
she
noticed
they
called
him
sam
next
thing
is
to
git
her
across
the
river
without
leavin
any
tracks
we
ai
on
a
travelled
road
now
pals
we
got
to
be
careful
i
carry
her
down
to
the
bank
but
be
sure
to
step
squarely
in
my
footprints
it
look
like
they
were
made
by
one
man
see
the
river
froze
over
an
we
ca
be
tracked
on
the
ice
it
too
dark
too
for
any
one
to
see
us
go
ahead
sammy
it
d
cold
here
the
big
man
lifted
her
from
the
ground
as
if
she
were
a
feather
and
she
was
conscious
of
being
borne
swiftly
through
a
stretch
of
sloping
woodland
down
to
the
river
bank
a
journey
of
two
or
three
hundred
yards
it
seemed
here
the
party
paused
for
many
minutes
before
venturing
out
upon
the
wide
expanse
of
frozen
river
evidently
making
sure
that
the
way
was
clear
rosalie
her
senses
quite
fully
restored
by
this
time
began
to
analyse
the
situation
with
a
clearness
and
calmness
that
afterward
was
the
object
of
considerable
surprise
to
her
instead
of
being
hysterical
with
fear
she
was
actually
experiencing
the
thrill
of
a
real
emotion
she
had
no
doubt
but
that
her
abductors
were
persons
hired
by
those
connected
with
her
early
history
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
she
could
not
believe
that
bodily
harm
was
to
be
her
fate
after
all
these
years
of
secret
attention
on
the
part
of
those
so
deeply
though
remotely
interested
somehow
there
raced
through
her
brain
the
exhilarating
conviction
that
at
last
the
mystery
of
her
origin
was
to
be
cleared
away
and
with
it
all
that
had
been
as
a
closed
book
no
thought
of
death
entered
her
mind
at
that
time
afterward
she
was
to
feel
that
death
would
be
most
welcome
no
matter
how
it
came
her
captors
made
the
trip
across
the
river
in
dead
silence
there
was
no
moon
and
the
night
was
inky
black
the
exposed
portions
of
her
face
tingled
with
cold
but
she
was
so
heavily
wrapped
in
the
blanket
that
her
body
did
not
feel
the
effects
of
the
zero
weather
at
length
the
icy
stretch
was
passed
and
after
resting
a
few
minutes
sam
proceeded
to
ascend
the
steep
bank
with
her
in
his
arms
why
she
was
not
permitted
to
walk
she
did
not
know
then
or
afterward
it
is
possible
even
likely
that
the
men
thought
their
charge
was
unconscious
she
did
nothing
to
cause
them
to
think
otherwise
again
they
passed
among
trees
sam
companions
following
in
his
footprints
as
before
another
halt
and
a
brief
command
for
davy
to
go
ahead
and
see
that
the
coast
was
clear
came
after
a
long
and
tortuous
struggle
through
the
underbrush
twice
they
seemed
to
have
lost
their
bearings
in
the
darkness
but
eventually
they
came
into
the
open
here
we
are
grunted
sam
as
they
hurried
across
the
clearing
a
hard
night
work
pals
but
i
guess
we
in
easy
street
now
go
ahead
davy
an
open
the
trap
davy
swore
a
mighty
but
sibilant
oath
and
urged
his
thick
ugly
figure
ahead
of
the
others
a
moment
later
the
desperadoes
and
their
victim
passed
through
a
door
and
into
a
darkness
even
blacker
than
that
outside
davy
was
pounding
carefully
upon
the
floor
of
the
room
in
which
they
stood
suddenly
a
faint
light
spread
throughout
the
room
and
a
hoarse
raucous
voice
whispered
have
you
got
her
get
out
of
the
way
we
near
froze
responded
davy
gruffly
get
down
there
bill
and
take
her
i
tired
carryin
this
hundred
and
twenty
pounder
growled
sam
the
next
instant
rosalie
was
conscious
of
being
lowered
through
a
trap
door
in
the
floor
and
then
of
being
borne
rapidly
through
a
long
narrow
passage
lighted
fitfully
by
the
rays
of
a
lantern
in
the
hands
of
a
fourth
and
as
yet
unseen
member
of
the
band
there
said
bill
impolitely
dropping
his
burden
upon
a
pile
of
straw
in
the
corner
of
the
rather
extensive
cave
at
the
end
of
the
passage
wonder
if
the
little
fool
is
dead
she
ought
to
be
coming
to
by
this
time
she
got
her
eyes
wide
open
uttered
the
raucous
voice
on
the
opposite
side
and
rosalie
turned
her
eyes
in
that
direction
she
looked
for
a
full
minute
as
if
spellbound
with
terror
her
gaze
centred
at
the
most
repulsive
human
face
she
ever
had
seen
the
face
of
davy
mother
the
woman
was
a
giantess
a
huge
hideous
creature
with
the
face
of
a
man
hairy
and
bloated
her
unkempt
hair
was
grey
almost
to
whiteness
her
teeth
were
snags
and
her
eyes
were
almost
hidden
beneath
the
shaggy
brow
there
was
a
glare
of
brutal
satisfaction
in
them
that
appalled
the
girl
for
the
first
time
since
the
adventure
began
her
heart
failed
her
and
she
shuddered
perceptibly
as
her
lids
fell
what
the
h
are

skeering
her
fer
like

ma
growled
davy

if
she

added
bill
savagely
roughly
the
old
woman
slashed
the
bonds
from
the
girl
hands
and
feet
and
then
looked
askance
at
sam
who
stood
warming
his
hands
over
a
kerosene
stove
not
far
away
he
nodded
his
head
and
she
instantly
untied
the
cloth
that
covered
rosalie
mouth
it
wo
do
no
good
to
scream

the
old

yell
if
she
wants
to
maude
it
may
relieve
her
a
bit
said
sam
meaning
to
be
kind
instinctively
rosalie
looked
about
for
the
person
addressed
as
maude
there
was
but
one
woman
in
the
gang
maude
that
was
the
creature
name
instead
of
crying
or
shrieking
rosalie
laughed
outright
at
the
sound
of
the
laugh
the
woman
drew
back
hastily
by
gor
she
gasped
the
she
gone
daffy
the
men
turned
toward
them
with
wonder
in
their
faces
bill
was
the
first
to
comprehend
he
saw
the
girl
face
grow
sober
with
an
effort
and
realised
that
she
was
checking
her
amusement
because
it
was
sure
to
offend
aw
he
grinned
i
do
blame
her
fer
laughin
say
what
ye
will
maude
your
name
do
fit
you
it
as
good
as
any
name
began
the
old
hag
glaring
at
him
but
sam
interposed
with
a
command
to
her
to
get
them
some
hot
coffee
while
he
had
a
talk
with
the
girl
set
up
he
said
roughly
addressing
rosalie
we
ai
goin
to
hurt
you
rosalie
struggled
to
a
sitting
posture
her
limbs
and
back
stiff
from
the
cold
and
inaction
do
ask
questions
because
they
wo
be
answered
i
jest
want
to
give
you
some
advice
as
to
how
you
must
act
while
you
are
our
guest
you
must
be
like
one
of
the
family
maybe
be
here
a
day
maybe
a
week
but
it
wo
be
any
longer
than
that
would
you
mind
telling
me
where
i
am
and
what
this
all
means
why
have
you
committed
this
outrage
what
have
i
done
she
found
voice
to
say
he
held
up
his
hand
you
forget
what
i
said
about
askin
questions
there
ai
nothin
to
tell
you
that
all

well
who
is
it
that

the
power
to
answer
questions
sir
i
have
some
right
to
ask
them
you
have
that
do
now
he
growled
i
put
the
gag
back
on
you
if
you
keep
it
up
so
you
wo
worry
i
want
to
say
this
to
you
your
friends
do
know
where
you
are
and
they
could
find
you
if
they
tried
you
are
to
stay
right
here
in
this
cave
until
we
get
orders
to
move
you
when
the
time
comes
we
take
you
to
wherever
we
ordered
and
then
we
through
with
you
somebody

have
the
say

here
unless
you
try
to
escape
it
wo
do
you
any
good
to
yell
it
ai
a
palace
but
it
better
than
the
grave
so
be
wise
all
we
got
to
do
is
to
turn
you
over
to
the
proper
parties
at
the
proper
time
that
all
is
the
person
you
speak
of
my
my
mother
or
my
father
rosalie
asked
with
bated
breath
chapter
xix
with
the
kidnapers
sam
stared
at
her
and
there
was
something
like
real
amazement
in
his
eyes
yer
mother
or
father
he
repeated
interrogatively
wha
what
the
devil
can
they
have
to
do
with
this
affair
i
guess
they
askin
a
lot
of
questions
themselves

she
said
and
then
shrewdly
added
and
you

i
heard
that
sayin
a
child

knowin
its

but
this
business

new
one

me
i
guess

chloroform

that
booze
bill
she
dippy
yet
he
tried
to
induce
her
to
swallow
some
of
the
whiskey
but
steadfastly
she
refused
until
finally
with
an
evil
snarl
sam
commanded
the
giantess
to
hold
her
while
he
forced
the
burning
liquor
down
her
throat
there
was
a
brief
struggle
but
rosalie
was
no
match
for
the
huge
woman
whose
enormous
arms
encircled
her
and
as
the
liquid
trickled
in
upon
her
tongue
she
heard
above
the
brutal
laughter
of
the
doctors
the
hoarse
voice
of
bill
crying
do
hurt
her
sam
let
alone
close
yer
face
do

i
well

sputtering
and
choking
her
heart
beating
wildly
with
fear
and
rage
rosalie
was
thrown
back
upon
the
straw
by
the
woman
her
throat
was
burning
from
the
effects
of
the
whiskey
and
her
eyes
were
blinded
by
the
tears
of
anger
and
helplessness
do
come
any
of
your
highfalutin
airs
with
me
you
little
cat
shrieked
the
old
woman
rubbing
a
knee
that
rosalie
had
kicked
in
her
struggles
lay
still
there
added
sam
we
do
want

ai
attendin
no
picnic
no
boozin
was
sam
order
as
he
told
out
small
portions
of
whiskey
then
the
gang
ate
ravenously
of
the
bacon
and
beans
and
drank
cup
after
cup
of
coffee
later
the
men
threw
themselves
upon
the
piles
of
straw
and
soon
all
were
snoring
the
big
woman
refilled
the
lantern
and
hung
it
on
a
peg
in
the
wall
of
the
cave
then
she
took
up
her
post
near
the
square
door
leading
to
the
underground
passage
her
throne
an
upturned
whiskey
barrel
her
back
against
the
wall
of
the
cave
she
glared
at
rosalie
through
the
frequently
addressing
her
with
the
vilest
invectives
cautiously
uttered
and
all
because
her
victim
had
beautiful
eyes
and
was
unable
to
close
them
in
sleep
illustration
rosalie
was
no
match
for
the
huge
woman
rosalie
heart
sank
as
she
surveyed
the
surroundings
with
her
mind
once
more
clear
and
composed
after
her
recovery
from
the
shock
of
contact
with
the
old
woman
and
sam
she
shrank
into
a
state
of
mental
lassitude
that
foretold
the
despair
which
was
to
come
later
on
she
did
not
sleep
that
night
her
brain
was
full
of
whirling
thoughts
of
escape
speculations
as
to
what
was
to
become
of
her
miserable
fears
that
the
end
would
not
be
what
the
first
impressions
had
made
it
and
over
all
a
most
intense
horror
of
the
old
woman
who
dozed
but
guarded
her
as
no
dragon
ever
watched
in
the
days
of
long
ago
the
cave
in
which
they
were
housed
was
thirty
or
forty
feet
from
side
to
side
almost
circular
in
shape
a
low
roof
slanting
to
the
rocky
floor
here
and
there
were
niches
in
the
walls
and
in
the
side
opposite
to
the
entrance
to
the
passageway
there
was
a
small
black
opening
leading
without
doubt
to
the
outer
world
the
fact
that
it
was
not
used
at
any
time
during
her
stay
in
the
cave
led
her
to
believe
it
was
not
of
practical
use
two
or
three
stoves
were
used
to
heat
the
cave
and
for
cooking
purposes
there
were
several
lanterns
a
number
of
implements
such
as
spades
axes
crowbars
sledges
and
so
forth
a
rough
table
which
was
used
for
all
purposes
known
to
the
kitchen
scullery
and
even
bedchamber
sam
slept
on
the
table
horse
blankets
were
thrown
about
the
floor
in
confusion
they
served
as
bedclothes
when
the
gang
slept
at
other
times
they
might
as
well
have
been
called
doormats
one
of
the
niches
in
the
wall
was
used
as
the
resting
place
for
such
bones
or
remnants
as
might
strike
it
when
hurled
in
that
direction
by
the
occupants
no
one
took
the
trouble
to
carefully
bestow
anything
in
the
garbage
hole
and
no
one
pretended
to
clean
up
after
the
other
the
place
was
foul
smelling
hot
and
almost
suffocating
with
the
fumes
from
the
stoves
for
which
there
seemed
no
avenue
of
escape
hours
afterward
although
they
seemed
drawn
out
into
years
the
men
began
to
breathe
naturally
and
a
weird
silence
reigned
in
the
cave
they
were
awake
the
venerable
maude
emerged
from
her
doze
looked
apprehensively
at
sam
prodded
the
corner
to
see
that
the
prize
had
not
faded
away
and
then
began
ponderously
to
make
preparations
for
a
meal
supposedly
breakfast
meagre
ablutions
such
as
they
were
were
performed
in
the
living
room
a
bucket
of
water
serving
as
a
general
no
one
had
removed
his
clothing
during
the
night
not
even
his
shoes
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
gang
was
in
an
condition
to
evacuate
the
place
at
a
moment
notice
rosalie
would
not
eat
nor
would
she
bathe
her
face
in
the
water
that
had
been
used
by
the
quartette
before
her
bill
briggs
with
some
sense
of
delicacy
in
his
nature
brought
some
fresh
water
from
the
far
end
of
the
passageway
for
this
act
he
was
reviled
by
his
companions
it
no
easy
job
to
get
water
here
briggs
roared
sam
we
got
to
be
savin
with
it
well
do
let
it
hurt

retorted

force
it
down

eat

said
sam
she
soon
get
over
that
we
was
only
hired
to
get
her
here
and
get
her
away
again
and
not
to
make
her
eat
or
even
that
nothing
to
us
well
she
got
to
eat
or
she
die
and
you

ai

be
retorted
the
old
woman
she
eat
before
she
die
maudie
do
worry
i
never
eat
a
mouthful
cried
rosalie
a
brave
stubborn
light
in
her
eyes
she
was
standing
in
the
far
corner
drying
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
oho
you
can
talk
again
eh
hooray
now
we
hear
the
story
of
her
life
laughed
big
sam
his
mouth
full
of
bacon
and
bread
rosalie
flushed
and
the
tears
welled
to
her
eyes
all
day
long
she
suffered
taunts
and
gibes
from
the
gang
she
grew
to
fear
davy
ugly
leers
more
than
the
brutal
words
of
the
others
when
he
came
near
she
shrank
back
against
the
wall
when
he
spoke
she
cringed
when
he
attempted
to
touch
her
person
she
screamed
it
was
this
act
that
brought
sam
wrath
upon
davy
head
he
won
something
like
gratitude
from
the
girl
by
profanely
commanding
davy
to
confine
his
love
to
looks
and
not
to
acts
she
ai
to
be
harmed
was
sam
edict
that
goes
too
aw
you
go
to
began
davy
belligerently
what
that
snarled
sam
whirling
upon
him
with
a
glare
davy
slunk
behind
his
mother
and
glared
back
bill
moved
over
to
sam
side
for
a
moment
the
air
was
heavy
with
signs
of
an
affray
rosalie
crouched
in
her
corner
her
hand
over
her
ears
her
eyes
closed
there
was
murder
in
davy
face
i
break
every
bone
in
your
body
added
sam
but
bill
laconically
stayed
him
with
a
word
rats
it
was
brief
but
it
brought
the
irate
sam
to
his
senses
trouble
was
averted
for
the
time
being
davy
ai
afraid
of
him
cried
that
worthy
mother
shrilly
you
bet
i
ai
added
davy
after
a
long
string
of
oaths
sam
grinned
viciously
there
ai
nothin
to
fight
about
i
guess
he
said
although
he
did
not
look
it
we
be
fools
to
scrap
everything
to
lose
and
nothin
to
gain
all
i
got
to
say
davy
is
that
you
ai
to
touch
that
girl
who
goin
to
touch
her
roared
davy
bristling
bravely
an
you
ai
to
touch
her
nuther
he
added
the
day
wore
away
although
it
was
always
night
in
the
windowless
cave
and
again
the
trio
of
men
slept
with
maude
as
guard
exhausted
and
faint
rosalie
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
the
next
morning
she
ate
sparingly
of
the
bacon
and
bread
and
drank
some
steaming
coffee
much
to
the
derisive
delight
of
the
hag
you
had
to
come
to
it
eh
she
croaked
had
to
feed
that
purty
face
after
all
i
guess
we
all
alike
we
all
flesh
and
blood
my
lady
the
old
woman
never
openly
offered
personal
violence
to
the
girl
she
stood
in
some
fear
of
the
leader
not
physical
fear
but
the
strange
homage
that
a
brute
pays
to
its
master
secretly
she
took
savage
delight
in
treading
on
the
girl
toes
or
in
pinching
her
arms
and
legs
twisting
her
hair
spilling
hot
coffee
on
her
hands
cursing
her
softly
and
perpetrating
all
sorts
of
little
indignities
that
could
not
be
resented
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
could
not
be
proved
against
her
her
word
was
as
good
as
rosalie
hourly
the
strain
grew
worse
and
worse
the
girl
became
ill
and
feverish
with
fear
loathing
and
uncertainty
her
ears
rang
with
the
horrors
of
their
lewdness
her
eyes
came
to
see
but
little
for
she
kept
them
closed
for
the
very
pain
of
what
they
were
likely
to
witness
in
her
heart
there
grew
a
constant
prayer
for
deliverance
from
their
clutches
she
was
much
too
and
healthy
to
pray
for
death
but
her
mind
fairly
reeled
with
the
thoughts
of
the
vengeance
she
would
exact
the
third
day
found
the
gang
morose
and
ugly
the
confinement
was
as
irksome
to
them
as
it
was
to
her
they
fretted
and
worried
swore
and
growled
at
nightfall
of
each
day
sam
ventured
forth
through
the
passage
and
out
into
the
night
each
time
he
was
gone
for
two
or
three
hours
and
each
succeeding
return
to
the
vile
cave
threw
the
gang
into
deeper
wrath
the
word
they
were
expecting
was
not
forthcoming
the
command
from
the
real
master
was
not
given
they
played
cards
all
day
and
at
last
began
to
drink
more
deeply
than
was
wise
two
desperate
fights
occurred
between
davy
and
sam
on
the
third
day
bill
and
the
old
woman
pulled
them
apart
after
both
had
been
battered
savagely
she
sick
sam
growled
bill
standing
over
the
cowering
prisoner
near
the
close
of
the
fourth
day
sam
had
been
away
nearly
all
of
the
previous
night
returning
gloomily
without
news
from
headquarters
she
die
in
this
d
place
and
so
will
we
if
we
get
out
soon
look
at
her
why
she
as
white
as
a
sheet
let
give
her
some
fresh
air
sammy
it
safe
take
her
up
in
the
cabin
for
a
while
we
can
take
her
outside
the
place
good
lord
sammy
i
got
a
bit
of
heart
i
ca
see
her
die
in
this
hole
look
at
her
ca
you
see
she
nearly
done
for
after
considerable
argument
pro
and
con
it
was
decided
that
it
would
be
safe
and
certainly
wise
to
let
the
girl
breathe
the
fresh
air
once
in
a
while
that
morning
sam
took
her
into
the
cabin
through
the
passage
the
half
hour
in
the
cold
fresh
air
revived
her
strengthened
her
perceptibly
her
spirits
took
an
upward
bound
she
began
to
ask
questions
and
for
some
reason
he
began
to
take
notice
of
them
it
may
have
been
the
irksomeness
of
the
situation
his
own
longing
to
be
away
his
anger
toward
the
person
who
had
failed
to
keep
the
promise
made
before
the
abduction
that
led
him
to
talk
quite
freely
chapter
xx
in
the
cave
it
not
my
fault
that
we
still
here
he
growled
in
answer
to
her
pathetic
appeal
i
heard
you
prayin
for
daddy
crow
to
come
and
take
you
away
well
it
lucky
for
him
that
he
do
know
where
you
are
we
make
mincemeat
of
that
old
jay
in
three
minutes
do
do
any
more
prayin
prayers
are
like
dreams
you
have
at
night
and
wonder
why
the
next
day
now
look
miss
gray
we
did
do
this
rotten
job
for
the
love
of
excitement
we
just
as
anxious
to
get
out
of
it
as
you
are
i
only
ask
why
i
am
held
here
and
what
is
to
become
of
me
said
rosalie
resignedly
she
was
standing
across
the
table
from
where
he
sat
smoking
his
great
black
pipe
the
other
members
of
the
gang
were
lounging
about
surly
and
chafing
inwardly
over
the
delay
in
getting
away
from
the
cave
i
do
know
why
you
been
held
here
i
only
know
it
d
slow
i
chuck
the
job
if
there
was
so
much
dust
in
it
for
me
but
what
is
to
become
of
me
i
can
not
endure
this
much
longer
it
is
killing
me
look
i
am
black
and
blue
from
pinches
the
old
woman
never
misses
an
opportunity
to
hurt
me
she
jealous
of
you
because
you
purty
that
all
women
are
all
alike
hang
i
would
be
in
this
sort
of
work
if
it
had
been
for
a
jealous
wife
he
puffed
at
his
pipe
moodily
for
a
long
time
evidently
turning
some
problem
over
and
over
in
his
mind
at
last
heaving
a
deep
sigh
and
prefacing
his
remarks
with
an
oath
he
let
light
in
upon
the
mystery
i
put
you
next
to
the
job
ca
give
any
names
it
would
be
square
you
see
it
this
way
you
ai
wanted
in
this
country
i
do
know
why
but
you
ai
not
wanted
in
this
country
she
cried
blankly
i
do
stand
in
any
one
way
my
life
and
my
love
are
for
the
peaceful
home
that
you
have
taken
me
from
i
do
ask
for
anything
else
wo
you
tell
your
employer
as
much
for
me
if
i
am
released
i
shall
never
interfere
with
the
plans
of
that
i
reckon
you
must
be
mighty
important
to
somebody
or
all
this
trouble
would
be
gone
through
with
the
funny
part
of
it
is
that
we
ai
to
hurt
you
you
ai
to
be
killed
you
know
that
the
queer
part
of
it
ai
it
i
admit
it
has
an
agreeable
sound
to
me
said
rosalie
with
a
shadow
of
a
smile
on
her
trembling
lips
it
seems
ghastly
though
well
anyhow
it
part
of
somebody
scheme
to
get
you
out
of
this
country
altogether
you
are
to
be
taken
away
on
a
ship
across
the
ocean
i
think
paris
or
london
mebby
and
you
are
never
to
come
back
to
the
united
states
never
that
what
i
told
illustration
she
shrank
back
from
another
blow
which
seemed
impending
rosalie
was
speechless
stunned
her
eyes
grew
wide
with
the
misery
of
doubt
and
horror
her
lips
moved
as
if
forming
the
words
which
would
not
come
before
she
could
bring
a
sound
from
the
contracted
throat
the
raucous
voice
of
old
maude
broke
in
what
are
you
tellin
her
sam
welch
ca
you
keep
your
face
closed
she
called
advancing
upon
him
with
a
menacing
look
aw
it
nothin
to
you
he
retorted
but
an
uncomfortable
expression
suddenly
crept
into
his
face
a
loud
angry
discussion
ensued
the
whole
gang
engaging
three
to
one
was
the
way
it
stood
against
the
leader
who
was
forced
to
admit
secretly
if
not
publicly
that
he
had
no
right
to
talk
freely
of
the
matter
to
the
girl
in
vain
she
pleaded
and
promised
her
tears
were
of
no
avail
once
sam
had
concluded
to
hold
his
tongue
angry
with
himself
for
having
to
submit
to
the
demands
of
the
others
furious
because
she
saw
his
surrender
sam
without
a
word
of
warning
suddenly
struck
her
on
the
side
of
the
head
with
the
flat
of
his
broad
hand
sending
her
reeling
into
the
corner
dazed
hurt
and
half
stunned
she
dropped
to
her
knees
unable
to
stand
with
a
piteous
look
in
her
eyes
she
shrank
back
from
another
blow
which
seemed
impending
bill
briggs
grasped
his
leader
arm
and
drew
him
away
cursing
and
snarling
late
in
the
afternoon
bill
was
permitted
to
conduct
her
into
the
cabin
above
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
air
and
for
a
glimpse
of
the
failing
sunlight
she
had
scarcely
taken
her
stand
before
the
little
window
when
she
was
hastily
jerked
away
but
not
before
she
thought
she
had
perceived
a
crowd
of
men
huddling
among
the
trees
not
far
away
a
scream
for
help
started
to
her
lips
but
bill
heavy
hand
checked
it
effectually
his
burly
arm
sent
her
scuttling
toward
the
and
a
second
later
she
was
below
bruised
from
the
fall
and
half
fainting
with
disappointment
and
despair
brief
as
the
glimpse
had
been
she
was
positive
she
recognised
two
faces
in
the
crowd
of
men
anderson
crow
and
ed
higgins
it
meant
if
her
eyes
did
not
deceive
her
that
the
searchers
were
near
at
hand
and
that
dear
old
daddy
crow
was
leading
them
her
hopes
flew
upward
and
she
could
not
subdue
the
triumphant
glance
that
swept
the
startled
crowd
when
bill
breathlessly
broke
the
news
absolute
quiet
reigned
in
the
cave
after
that
maude
cowed
the
prisoner
into
silence
with
the
threat
to
cut
out
her
tongue
if
she
uttered
a
cry
later
the
tramp
of
feet
could
be
heard
on
the
floor
of
the
cabin
there
was
a
sound
of
voices
loud
peals
of
laughter
and
then
the
noise
made
by
some
one
in
the
cellar
that
served
as
a
blind
at
one
end
of
the
cabin
after
that
dead
silence
at
nightfall
sam
stealthily
ventured
forth
to
reconnoitre
he
came
back
with
the
report
that
the
woods
and
swamps
were
clear
and
that
the
searchers
if
such
they
were
had
gone
away
the
house
since
davy
grandma
bones
were
stored
away
in
that
cellar
for
several
moons
has
always
been
thought
to
be
haunted
the
fools
probably
thought
they
saw
a
ghost
an
they
runnin
yet
then
for
the
first
time
rosalie
realised
that
she
was
in
the
haunted
cabin
in
the
swamp
the
most
fearsome
of
all
places
in
the
world
to
tinkletown
large
and
small
not
more
than
three
miles
from
her
own
fireside
not
more
than
half
an
hour
walk
from
daddy
crow
and
others
in
the
warmth
of
whose
love
she
had
lived
so
long
it
gettin
too
hot
here
for
us
growled
sam
at
supper

to

stole
forth
into
the
night
leaving
his
companions
more
or
less
uneasy
as
to
the
result
after
the
startling
events
of
the
afternoon
hour
after
hour
passed
and
with
every
minute
therein
rosalie
ears
strained
themselves
to
catch
the
first
sound
of
approaching
rescuers
her
spirits
fell
but
her
hopes
were
high
she
felt
sure
that
the
men
outside
had
seen
her
face
and
that
at
last
they
had
discovered
the
place
in
which
she
was
kept
it
would
only
be
a
question
of
time
until
they
learned
the
baffling
secret
of
the
her
only
fear
lay
in
the
possibility
that
she
might
be
removed
by
her
captors
before
the
rescuers
could
accomplish
her
delivery
her
bright
feverish
eager
eyes
gleaming
from
the
sunken
white
cheeks
appealed
to
bill
briggs
more
than
he
cared
to
admit
the
ruffian
less
hardened
than
his
fellows
began
to
feel
sorry
for
her
eleven
found
the
trio
anxious
and
ugly
in
their
restlessness
there
was
no
sleep
for
them
davy
visited
the
trap
over
a
hundred
times
that
night
his
mother
breaking
over
the
traces
of
restraint
hugged
the
jug
of
whiskey
taking
swig
after
swig
as
the
vigil
wore
on
at
last
davy
driven
to
it
insisted
upon
having
his
share
bill
drank
but
little
and
it
was
not
long
before
rosalie
observed
the
shifty
nervous
look
in
his
eyes
from
time
to
time
he
slyly
appropriated
certain
articles
dropping
them
into
his
coat
pocket
his
ear
muffs
muffler
gloves
matches
tobacco
and
many
chunks
of
bread
and
bacon
were
stowed
stealthily
in
the
pockets
of
his
coat
at
last
it
dawned
upon
her
that
bill
was
preparing
to
desert
hope
lay
with
him
then
if
he
could
only
be
induced
to
give
her
an
equal
chance
to
escape
mother
and
son
became
maudlin
in
their
not
cups
but
jug
but
davy
had
the
sense
to
imbibe
more
cautiously
a
fact
which
seemed
to
annoy
the
nervous
bill
i
must
have
air
fresh
air
suddenly
moaned
rosalie
from
her
corner
the
strain
proving
too
great
for
her
nerves
bill
strode
over
and
looked
down
upon
the
trembling
form
for
a
full
minute

bill

about

up
in
the
cabin
fer
a
couple
of
minutes
there
ai
no
danger
davy
protested
but
bill
carried
his
point
simply
because
he
was
sober
and
knew
his
power
over
the
pair
davy
let
them
out
through
the
trap
promising
to
wait
below
until
they
were
ready
to

rosalie

with

oh
god
if
you
moaning
piteously
she
pleaded
with
him
but
he
was
obdurate
chiefly
through
fear
of
the
consequences
in
his
heart
he
might
have
been
willing
to
give
her
the
chance
but
his
head
saw
the
danger
to
itself
and
it
was
firm
i
tell
you
what
i
do
he
whispered
in
the
end
i

and
then
i
go
and

and
i
swear

out
of
this
a
minute
or
two
later
he
dragged
her
back
into
the
cabin
moaning
pleading
and
crying
from
the
pain
of
a
sudden
blow
ten
minutes
afterward
he
went
forth
again
this
time
ostensibly
to
meet
sam
but
rosalie
knew
that
he
was
gone
forever
chapter
xxi
the
a
sickly
new
moon
threw
vague
ghostly
beams
across
the
swamp
out
beyond
the
little
cabin
that
stood
on
its
border
through
the
dense
undergrowth
and
high
among
the
skeleton
treetops
ugly
shadows
played
with
each
other
while
a
sepulchral
orchestra
of
wind
and
bough
shrieked
a
dirge
that
flattened
in
bonner
ears
but
it
was
not
the
weird
music
of
the
swamp
that
sent
the
shudder
of
actual
terror
through
the
frame
of
the
big
athlete
a
series
of
muffled
heartbreaking
moans
like
those
of
a
woman
in
dire
pain
came
to
his
ears
he
felt
the
cold
perspiration
start
over
his
body
his
nerves
grew
tense
with
trepidation
his
eyes
wide
with
horror
instinctively
his
fingers
clutched
the
revolver
at
his
side
and
his
gaze
went
toward
the
black
square
thing
which
marked
the
presence
of
the
haunted
house
the
orchestra
of
the
night
seemed
to
bring
its
dirge
to
a
close
a
chill
interlude
of
silence
ensued
the
moans
died
away
into
choking
sobs
and
bonner
ears
could
hear
nothing
else
a
sudden
thought
striking
him
he
rolled
out
of
his
bed
and
made
his
way
to
pile
of
blankets
but
the
solution
was
not
there
the
lad
was
sound
asleep
and
no
sound
issued
from
his
lips
the
moans
came
from
another
source
human
or
otherwise
out
there
in
the
crinkling
night
carefully
making
his
way
from
the
tent
his
courage
once
more
restored
but
his
flesh
still
quivering
bonner
looked
intently
for
manifestations
in
the
black
home
of
johanna
rank
he
half
expected
to
see
a
ghostly
light
flit
past
a
window
it
was
intensely
dark
in
the
thicket
but
the
shadowy
marsh
beyond
silhouetted
the
house
into
a
black
relief
he
was
on
all
fours
behind
a
thick
pile
of
brush
nervously
drawing
his
pipe
from
his
pocket
conscious
that
he
needed
it
to
steady
his
nerves
when
a
fresh
sound
rising
above
the
faint
sobs
reached
his
ears
then
the
low
voice
of
a
man
came
from
some
place
in
the
darkness
and
these
words
rang
out
distinctly
damn
you
he
drew
back
involuntarily
for
the
voice
seemed
to
be
at
his
elbow
the
sobs
ceased
suddenly
as
if
choked
by
a
mighty
hand
the
listener
inclination
was
to
follow
the
example
of
anderson
crow
and
run
madly
off
into
the
night
but
beneath
this
natural
panic
was
the
soul
of
chivalry
something
told
him
that
a
woman
out
there
in
the
solitude
needed
the
arms
of
a
man
and
his
blood
began
to
grow
hot
again
presently
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
sharp
cry
of
despair
have
pity
oh
god
moaned
the
voice
that
sent
thrills
through
his
body
the
voice
of
a
woman
tender
refined
crushed
his
fingers
gripped
the
revolver
with
fresh
vigor
but
almost
instantly
the
rustling
of
dead
leaves
reached
his
ears
the
man
and
his
victim
were
making
their
way
toward
the
house
bonner
crouched
among
the
bushes
as
if
paralysed
he
began
to
comprehend
the
situation
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
he
remembered
hearing
of
tinkletown
sensation
over
at
his
uncle
house
where
he
was
living
with
a
couple
of
servants
for
a
month
shooting
the
atmosphere
had
been
full
of
the
sensational
abduction
story
for
several
days
the
abduction
of
a
beautiful
young
woman
and
the
helpless
attitude
of
the
relatives
and
friends
like
a
whirlwind
the
whole
situation
spread
itself
before
him
it
left
him
weak
he
had
come
upon
the
gang
and
their
victim
in
this
corner
of
the
world
far
from
the
city
toward
which
they
were
supposed
to
have
fled
he
had
the
solution
in
his
hands
and
he
was
filled
with
the
fire
of
the
ancients
a
light
appeared
in
the
low
doorway
and
the
squat
figure
of
a
man
held
a
lantern
on
high
an
instant
later
another
man
dragged
the
helpless
girl
across
the
threshold
and
into
the
house
even
as
bonner
squared
himself
to
rush
down
upon
them
the
light
disappeared
and
darkness
fell
over
the
cabin
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
floor
a
creaking
of
hinges
and
the
stealthy
closing
of
a
door
then
there
was
absolute
quiet
bonner
was
wise
as
well
as
brave
he
saw
that
to
rush
down
upon
the
house
now
might
prove
his
own
as
well
as
her
undoing
in
the
darkness
the
bandits
would
have
every
advantage
for
a
moment
he
glared
at
the
black
shadow
ahead
his
brain
working
like
lightning
that
poor
girl
he
muttered
vaguely
damn
beasts
but
i
fix
by
heaven
it
wo
be
long
my
boys
his
pondering
brought
quick
results
crawling
to
bud
cot
he
aroused
him
from
a
deep
sleep
inside
of
two
minutes
the
lad
was
streaking
off
through
the
woods
toward
town
with
instructions
to
bring
anderson
crow
and
a
large
force
of
men
to
the
spot
as
quickly
as
possible
i
stand
guard
said
wicker
bonner
as
the
minutes
went
by
bonner
thoughts
dwelt
more
and
more
intently
upon
the
poor
imprisoned
girl
in
the
cabin
his
blood
charged
his
reason
and
he
could
scarce
control
the
impulse
to
dash
in
upon
the
wretches
then
he
brought
himself
up
with
a
jerk
where
was
he
to
find
them
had
he
not
searched
the
house
that
morning
and
was
there
a
sign
of
life
to
be
found
he
was
stunned
by
this
memory
for
many
minutes
he
stood
with
his
perplexed
eyes
upon
the
house
before
a
solution
came
to
him
he
now
knew
that
there
was
a
secret
apartment
in
the
old
house
and
a
secret
means
of
entrance
and
exit
with
this
explanation
firmly
impressed
upon
his
mind
wicker
bonner
decided
to
begin
his
own
campaign
for
the
liberation
of
rosalie
gray
it
would
be
hours
before
the
sluggish
anderson
crow
appeared
and
bonner
was
not
the
sort
to
leave
a
woman
in
jeopardy
if
it
was
in
his
power
to
help
her
besides
the
country
people
had
filled
him
with
stories
of
miss
gray
beauty
and
they
found
him
at
an
impressionable
and
age
the
thrill
of
romance
seized
him
and
he
was
ready
to
dare
he
crept
up
to
the
doorway
and
listened
reason
told
him
that
the
coast
was
clear
the
necessity
for
a
sentinel
did
not
exist
so
cleverly
were
the
desperadoes
under
cover
after
a
few
moments
he
crawled
into
the
room
holding
his
breath
as
he
made
his
way
toward
the
cellar
staircase
he
had
gone
but
a
few
feet
when
the
sound
of
voices
came
to
him
slinking
into
a
corner
he
awaited
developments
the
sounds
came
from
below
but
not
from
the
cellar
room
as
he
had
located
it
a
moment
later
a
man
crawled
into
the
room
coming
through
a
hole
in
the
floor
just
as
he
had
suspected
a
faint
light
from
below
revealed
the
sinister
figure
plainly
but
bonner
felt
himself
to
be
quite
thoroughly
hidden
the
man
in
the
room
spoke
to
some
one
below
i
be
back
in
half
an
hour
davy
i
wait
fer
sam
out
there
on
the
point
he
ought
to
have
some
news
from
headquarters
by
this
time
i
do
see
why
we
have
to
hang
around
this
place
forever
she
ought
to
be
half
way
to
paris
by
now
they
do
want
to
take
chances
bill
till
the
excitement
blows
over
well
you
an
your
mother
just
keep
your
hands
off
of
her
while
out
that
all
warned
bill
briggs
the
was
closed
and
bonner
heard
the
other
occupant
of
the
room
shuffle
out
into
the
night
he
was
not
long
in
deciding
what
to
do
here
was
the
chance
to
dispose
of
one
of
the
bandits
and
he
was
not
slow
to
seize
it
there
was
a
meeting
in
the
thicket
a
few
minutes
later
and
bill
was
out
of
the
way
for
the
time
being
wicker
bonner
dropped
him
with
a
blow
and
when
he
returned
to
the
cabin
bill
was
lying
bound
and
gagged
in
the
tent
a
helpless
captive
his
conqueror
immensely
satisfied
supplied
himself
with
the
surplus
ends
of
guy
ropes
from
the
tent
and
calmly
sat
down
to
await
the
approach
of
the
one
called
sam
he
who
had
doubtless
gone
to
a
rendezvous
for
news
he
could
well
afford
to
bide
his
time
with
two
of
the
desperadoes
disposed
of
in
ambuscade
he
could
have
a
fairly
even
chance
with
the
man
called
davy
it
seemed
hours
before
he
heard
the
stealthy
approach
of
some
one
moving
through
the
bushes
he
was
stiff
with
cold
and
chafing
at
the
interminable
delay
but
the
approach
of
real
danger
quickened
his
blood
once
more
there
was
another
short
sharp
silent
struggle
near
the
doorway
and
once
more
wicker
bonner
stood
victorious
over
an
unsuspecting
and
now
unconscious
bandit
sam
a
big
powerful
man
was
soon
bound
and
gagged
and
his
bulk
dragged
off
to
the
tent
among
the
bushes
now
for
davy
muttered
bonner
stretching
his
great
arms
in
the
pure
relish
of
power
there
will
be
something
doing
around
your
heart
miss
in
a
very
few
minutes
he
chuckled
as
he
crept
into
the
cabin
first
having
listened
intently
for
sounds
for
some
minutes
he
lay
quietly
with
his
ear
to
the
floor
in
that
time
he
solved
one
of
the
problems
confronting
him
the
man
davy
was
a
son
of
old
rank
murderer
and
the
old
woman
who
kept
watch
with
him
was
his
mother
wife
of
the
historic
david
it
was
she
who
had
held
the
lantern
no
doubt
while
david
wolfe
chopped
her
own
mother
to
mincemeat
this
accounted
for
the
presence
of
the
gang
in
the
haunted
house
and
for
their
knowledge
of
the
underground
room
bonner
inspiration
began
to
wear
off
pure
luck
had
aided
him
up
to
this
stage
but
the
bearding
of
david
in
his
lair
was
another
proposition
altogether
his
only
hope
was
that
he
might
find
the
man
asleep
he
was
not
taking
the
old
woman
into
consideration
at
all
had
he
but
known
it
she
was
the
most
dangerous
of
all
his
chance
he
thought
lay
in
strategy
it
was
impossible
to
open
the
from
above
he
had
found
by
investigation
there
was
but
one
way
to
get
to
miss
gray
and
that
was
by
means
of
a
daring
ruse
trusting
to
luck
he
tapped
gently
on
the
floor
at
the
spot
where
memory
told
him
the
was
situated
his
heart
was
thumping
violently
there
was
a
movement
below
him
and
then
the
sound
of
some
one
handling
the
bolts
in
the
door
bonner
drew
back
hoping
against
hope
that
a
light
would
not
be
shown
in
one
hand
he
held
his
revolver
ready
for
use
in
the
other
his
heavy
walking
stick
his
plans
were
fully
developed
after
a
moment
the
trap
was
lifted
partially
and
a
draft
of
warm
air
came
out
upon
him

bonner
seized
the
edge
of
the
door
with
his
left
hand
first
pushing
his
revolver
in
his
trousers
pocket
then
he
silently
swung
the
heavy
cane
through
the
air
and
downward
a
very
faint
light
from
below
revealing
the
shock

of

it
was
a
mighty
blow
and
true
davy
body
fell
away
from
the
trap
and
a
second
later
bonner
dropped
through
the
hole
he
left
the
trap
wide
open
in
case
retreat
were
necessary
pausing
long
enough
to
assure
himself
that
the
man
was
unconscious
and
bleeding
profusely
and
to
snatch
the
big
revolver
from
davy
person
bonner
turned
his
attention
to
the
surroundings
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
away
at
the
end
of
a
long
low
passage
he
saw
the
glimmer
of
a
light
without
a
second
hesitation
he
started
toward
it
feeling
that
the
worst
of
the
adventure
was
past
a
shadow
coming
between
him
and
the
light
he
paused
in
his
approach
this
shadow
resolved
itself
into
the
form
of
a
woman
a
gigantic
creature
who
peered
intently
up
the
passage
what
the
matter
davy
she
called
in
raucous
tones
you
damn
fool
ca
you
do
anything
without
breaking
your
neck
i
reckon
you
fell
down
the
steps
that
you
sam
receiving
no
answer
the
woman
clutched
the
lantern
and
advanced
boldly
upon
bonner
who
stood
far
down
the
passage
amazed
and
irresolute
she
looked
more
formidable
to
him
than
any
of
the
men
so
he
prepared
for
a
struggle
halt
he
cried
when
she
was
within
ten
feet
of
him
do
resist
you
are
surrounded
the
woman
stopped
like
one
shot
glared
ahead
as
if
she
saw
him
for
the
first
time
and
then
uttered
a
frightful
shriek
of
rage
dashing
the
lantern
to
the
ground
she
raised
her
arm
and
fired
a
revolver
point
blank
at
bonner
despite
the
fact
that
his
pistol
was
covering
her
he
heard
the
bullet
crash
into
the
rotten
timbers
near
his
ear
contrary
to
her
design
the
lantern
was
not
extinguished
instead
it
lay
sputtering
but
effective
upon
the
floor
before
bonner
could
make
up
his
mind
to
shoot
at
the
woman
she
was
upon
him
firing
again
as
she
came
he
did
not
have
time
to
retaliate
the
huge
frame
crushed
down
upon
him
and
his
pistol
flew
from
his
hand
as
luck
would
have
it
his
free
hand
clutched
her
revolver
and
she
was
prevented
from
blowing
his
brains
out
with
the
succeeding
shots
all
of
which
went
wild
then
came
a
desperate
struggle
bonner
a
trained
athlete
realised
that
she
was
even
stronger
than
he
more
desperate
in
her
frenzy
and
with
murder
in
her
heart
as
they
lunged
to
and
fro
her
curses
and
shrieks
in
his
ear
he
began
to
feel
the
despair
of
defeat
she
was
beating
him
down
with
one
mighty
arm
crushing
blows
every
one
of
them
then
came
the
sound
which
turned
the
tide
of
battle
for
it
filled
him
with
a
frenzy
equal
to
her
own
the
scream
of
a
woman
came
down
through
the
passage
piteous
he
knew
the
fate
of
that
poor
girl
if
his
adversary
overcame
him
the
thought
sent
his
blood
hot
and
cold
at
once
infuriatedly
he
exerted
his
fine
strength
and
the
tide
turned
panting
and
snarling
the
big
woman
was
battered
down
he
flung
her
heavily
to
the
ground
and
then
leaped
back
to
pick
up
his
revolver
expecting
a
renewal
of
the
attack
for
the
first
time
he
was
conscious
of
intense
pain
in
his
left
leg
the
woman
made
a
violent
effort
to
rise
and
then
fell
back
groaning
and
cursing
you
done
it
you
got
me
she
yelled
my
leg
broke
then
she
shrieked
for
davy
and
bill
and
sam
raining
curses
upon
the
law
and
upon
the
traitor
who
had
been
their
undoing
bonner
his
own
leg
wobbling
and
covered
with
blood
tried
to
quiet
her
but
without
success
he
saw
that
she
was
utterly
helpless
her
leg
twisted
under
her
heavy
body
her
screams
of
pain
as
he
turned
her
over
proved
conclusively
that
she
was
not
shamming
her
hip
was
dislocated
the
young
man
had
sense
enough
left
to
return
to
davy
before
venturing
into
the
cave
where
miss
gray
was
doubtless
in
a
dead
faint
the
man
was
breathing
but
still
unconscious
from
the
blow
on
the
head
bonner
quickly
tied
his
hands
and
feet
guarding
against
emergencies
in
case
of
his
own
incapacitation
as
the
result
of
the
bullet
wound
in
his
leg
then
he
hobbled
off
with
the
lantern
past
the
groaning
amazon
in
quest
of
rosalie
gray
it
did
not
occur
to
him
until
afterward
that
single
handed
he
had
overcome
a
most
desperate
band
of
criminals
so
simply
had
it
all
worked
out
up
to
the
time
of
the
encounter
with
the
woman
a
few
yards
beyond
where
the
old
woman
lay
moaning
he
came
upon
the
cave
in
which
the
bandits
made
their
home
holding
the
lantern
above
his
head
bonner
peered
eagerly
into
the
cavern
in
the
farthest
corner
crouched
a
girl
her
eyes
fastened
upon
the
stranger
how
do
you
do
miss
gray
came
the
cheery
greeting
from
his
lips
she
gasped
swept
her
hand
over
her
eyes
and
tried
piteously
to
speak
the
words
would
not
come
the
rescue
has
come
you
are
free
that
is
as
soon
as
we
find
our
way
out
of
this
place
let
me
introduce
myself
as
jack
the
giant
killer
hello
do
do
that
oh
the
devil
she
had
toppled
over
in
a
dead
faint
how
wicker
bonner
with
his
wounded
leg
weak
from
loss
of
blood
and
faint
from
the
reaction
carried
her
from
the
cave
through
the
passage
and
the
and
into
the
tent
can
only
be
imagined
not
described
he
only
knew
that
it
was
necessary
to
remove
her
from
the
place
and
that
his
strength
would
soon
be
gone
the
sun
was
tinting
the
east
before
she
opened
her
eyes
and
shuddered
in
the
meantime
he
had
stanched
the
flow
of
blood
in
the
fleshy
part
of
his
leg
binding
the
limb
tightly
with
a
piece
of
rope
it
was
an
ugly
glancing
cut
made
by
a
bullet
of
large
calibre
and
it
was
sure
to
put
him
on
crutches
for
some
time
to
come
even
now
he
was
scarcely
able
to
move
the
member
for
an
hour
he
had
been
venting
his
wrath
upon
the
sluggish
anderson
crow
who
should
have
been
on
the
scene
long
before
this
two
of
his
captives
now
fully
conscious
were
glaring
at
their
companions
in
the
tent
with
hate
in
their
eyes
rosalie
gray
wan
dishevelled
but
more
beautiful
than
the
reports
had
foretold
could
not
at
first
believe
herself
to
be
free
from
the
clutches
of
the
bandits
it
took
him
many
minutes
many
painful
minutes
to
convince
her
that
it
was
not
a
dream
and
that
in
truth
he
was
wicker
bonner
gentleman
sitting
with
his
back
against
a
tent
pole
facing
the
cabin
through
the
flap
with
a
revolver
in
his
trembling
hand
he
told
her
of
the
night
adventures
and
was
repaid
tenfold
by
the
gratitude
which
shone
from
her
eyes
and
trembled
in
her
voice
in
return
she
told
him
of
her
capture
of
the
awful
experiences
in
the
cave
and
of
the
threats
which
had
driven
her
almost
to
the
end
of
endurance
oh
oh
i
could
love
you
forever
for
this
she
cried
in
the
fulness
of
her
joy
a
rapturous
smile
flew
to
bonner
eyes
forever
begins
with
this
instant
miss
gray
he
said
and
without
any
apparent
reason
the
two
shook
hands
afterward
they
were
to
think
of
this
trivial
act
and
vow
that
it
was
truly
the
beginning
they
were
young
and
full
of
the
romance
of
life
and
those
awful
men
are
really
captured
and
the
woman
she
cried
after
another
exciting
recital
from
him
sam
and
bill
fairly
snarled
suppose
they
should
get
loose
her
eyes
grew
wide
with
the
thought
of
it
they
ca
he
said
laconically
i
wish
the
marshal
and
his
bicycle
army
would
hurry
along
that
woman
and
davy
need
attention
i
hate
like
the
mischief
to
have
either
of
them
die
one
does
want
to
kill
people
you
know
miss
gray
but
they
were
killing
me
by
inches
she
protested
ouch
he
groaned
his
leg
giving
him
a
mighty
twinge
what
is
it
she
cried
in
alarm
why
should
we
wait
for
those
men
come
bonner
take
me
to
the
village
please
do
i
am
crazy
absolutely
crazy
to
see
daddy
crow
and
mother
i
can
walk
there
how
far
is
it
please
come
she
was
running
on
eagerly
in
this
strain
until
she
saw
the
look
of
pain
in
his
face
the
look
he
tried
so
hard
to
conceal
she
was
standing
straight
and
strong
and
eager
before
him
and
he
was
very
pale
under
the
tan
i
ca
miss
gray
i
sorry
you
know
see
where
there
smoke
there
fire
i
mean
where

done
for
in
other
words
done
for
oh
you
not
not
going
to
die
are
you
hurt
why
you
tell
me
whereupon
she
dropped
to
her
knees
at
his
side
her
dark
eyes
searching
his
intently
despair
in
them
until
the
winning
smile
struggled
back
into
his
the
captives
chuckled
audibly
what
can
i
what
shall
i
do
oh
why
do
those
men
come
it
must
be
noon
or
it
barely
six
miss

all
right
a
cut
in
my
leg
the
old
woman
plugged
me
i
ca
walk
you
know
but
and
you
carried
me
out
here
and
did
all
that
and
never
said
a
word
about
oh
how
good
and
brave
and
noble
you
are
when
anderson
crow
and
half
of
tinkletown
routed
out
by
bud
appeared
on
the
scene
an
hour
or
two
later
they
found
wicker
bonner
stretched
out
on
a
mattress
his
head
in
rosalie
lap
the
young
woman
held
his
revolver
in
her
hand
and
there
was
a
look
in
her
face
which
said
that
she
would
shoot
any
one
who
came
to
molest
her
charge
two
helpless
desperadoes
lay
cursing
in
the
corner
of
the
tent
anderson
crow
after
an
hour
of
deliberation
and
explanation
fell
upon
the
bound
and
helpless
bandits
and
bravely
carted
the
whole
lot
to
the
town
calaboose
wicker
bonner
and
his
nurse
were
taken
into
town
and
the
news
of
the
rescue
went
flying
over

and
eventually
to
the
four
corners

of
prominence
bonner
as
he
passed
up
the
main
street
in
peabody
sleigh
on
the
way
to
anderson
crow
home
was
the
centre
of
attraction
he
was
the
hero
of
the
hour
for

not

herself
pale
and
ill
with
torture
his
most
devoted
slave
what
else
could
tinkletown
do
but
pay
homage
when
it
saw
bonner
head
against
her
shoulder
and
anderson
crow
shouting
approval
from
the
that
carried
the
kidnapers
the
four
bandits
two
of
them
much
the
worse
for
the
night
contact
with
wicker
bonner
were
bundled
into
the
a
sadly
morose
gang
of
ghosts
i
owe
you
a
thousand
dollars
said
anderson
to
bonner
as
they
drew
up
in
front
of
the
marshal
home
all
tinkletown
was
there
to
see
how
crow
and
the
family
would
act
when
rosalie
was
restored
to
them
the
yard
was
full
of
gaping
villagers
and
there
was
a
diffident
cheer
when
crow
rushed
forth
and
fairly
dragged
rosalie
from
the
sleigh
blootch
peabody
gallantly
interposed
and
undertook
to
hand
the
girl
forth
with
the
grace
of
a
chesterfield
but
crow
had
her
way
i
take
it
out
in
board
and
lodging
grinned
wicker
bonner
to
anderson
as
two
strong
men
lifted
him
from
the
sleigh
where
bud
demanded
anderson
after
the
others
had
entered
the
house
he
stayed
down
to
the
to
guard
the
prisoners
said
blootch
nobody
could
find
the
key
to
the
door
and
nobody
else
would
stay
they
ai
locked
in
but

revolvers
and

says
they

anderson
crow
was
himself
once
more
he
was
twenty
years
younger
than
when
he
went
to
bed
the
night
before
his
joy
and
pride
had
reached
the
bursting
point
dignity
alone
prevented
the
catastrophe
what
do
you
expect
to
do
with
the
gang
mr
crow
asked
bonner
reclining
with
amiable
ease
in
the
marshal
morris
chair
he
was
feeling
very
comfortable
despite
doc
smith
stitches
and
he
could
not
help
acknowledging
with
more
or
less
of
a
glow
in
his
heart
that
it
was
nice
to
play
hero
to
such
a
heroine
well
i
protect
of
course
nobody
lynch
while
marshal
of
this
town
anderson
said
forgetful
of
the
fact
that
he
had
not
been
near
the
jail
where
master
bud
still
had
full
charge
of
affairs
keyless
but
determined
i
have
to
turn
them
over
to
the
county
sheriff
er
i
reckon
this
derned
old
calaboose
of
ourn
ai
any
too
safe
that
a
mighty
desperit
gang
captured
i
cai
remember
havin
took
sech
a
mob
before
has
it
occurred
to
you
crow
that
we
have
captured
only
the
hirelings
their
employer
whoever
he
or
she
may
be
is
at
large
and
probably
laughing
at
us
is
there
some
way
in
which
we
can
follow
the
case
up
and
land
the
leader
gosh
you
right
said
anderson
i
thought
of
that
this
mornin
but
it
clean
skipped
my
mind
since
then
there
where
the
mistake
was
made
bonner
it
probably
too
late
now
you
oughter
thought
about
the
leader
seems
to
me
why
daddy
crow
cried
rosalie
a
warm
flush
in
her
cheeks
once
more
has
bonner
done
his
part
has
he
taken
them
and
has
he
saved
me
from
worse
than
death
i
ai
castin
any
insinyations
at
him
rosalie
retorted
anderson
very
sternly
for
him
how
you
talk
like
that
i
not
offended
miss
gray
laughed
bonner
we
all
make
mistakes
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
however
that
crow
may
still
be
able
to
find
out
who
the
leader
is
the
prisoners
can
be
pumped
i
dare
say
you

with
you
you
oughter
been
lookin
after

hours
ago

there
ever
sence
nine
an
it
two
now
roscoe
helpin

muttered
anderson
abashed
at
that
instant
there
came
a
rush
of
footsteps
across
the
front
porch
and
in
burst
ed
higgins
and
blootch
peabody
fairly
gasping
with
excitement
hurry
up
anderson
down
to
the
jail
sputtered
the
former
and
then
he
was
gone
like
the
wind
blootch
determined
to
miss
nothing
whirled
to
follow
or
pass
him
if
possible
he
had
time
to
shout
over
his
shoulder
as
he
went
forth
without
closing
the
door
the
old
woman
has
lynched
herself
it
would
now
be
superfluous
to
remark
after
all
the
convulsions
tinkletown
had
experienced
inside
of
hours
that
the
populace
went
completely
to
pieces
in
face
of
this
last
trying
experiment
of
fate
with
one
accord
the
village
toppled
over
as
if
struck
by
a
broadside
and
lay
figuratively
speaking
writhing
in
its
own
gore
stupefaction
assailed
the
town
then
one
by
one
the
minds
of
the
people
scrambled
up
from
the
ashes
slowly
but
surely
only
to
wonder
where
lightning
would
strike
next
not
since
the
days
of
the
american
revolution
had
the
town
experienced
such
an
incessant
rush
of
incident
the
judgment
day
itself
with
gabriel
clarion
blasts
could
not
be
expected
to
surpass
this
productive
hour
in
thrills
it
was
true
that
old
maude
had
committed
suicide
in
the
calaboose
she
had
been
placed
on
a
cot
in
the
office
of
the
prison
and
smith
had
been
sent
for
immediately
after
her
arrival
but
he
was
making
a
call
in
the
country
bud
long
supported
by
half
a
dozen
boys
armed
with
revolutionary
muskets
which
would
not
go
off
unless
carried
stood
in
front
of
the
little
jail
with
its
wooden
walls
and
iron
bars
guarding
the
prisoners
zealously
the
calaboose
was
built
to
hold
tramps
and
drunken
men
but
not
for
the
purpose
of
housing
desperadoes
even
as
the
heroic
bud
watched
with
persevering
faithfulness
his
charges
were
planning
to
knock
their
prison
to
smithereens
and
at
the
proper
moment
escape
to
the
woods
and
hills
they
knew
the
grated
door
was
unlocked
but
they
imagined
the
place
to
be
completely
surrounded
by
vengeful
villagers
who
would
cut
them
down
like
rats
if
they
ventured
forth
had
they
but
known
that
bud
was
alone
it
is
quite
likely
they
would
have
sallied
forth
and
relieved
him
of
his
guns
spanked
him
soundly
and
then
ambled
off
unmolested
to
the
country
all
the
morning
old
maude
had
been
groaning
and
swearing
in
the
office
where
she
lay
unattended
bud
was
telling
his
friends
how
he
had
knocked
her
down
twice
in
the
cave
after
she
had
shot
six
times
and
slashed
at
him
with
her
dagger
when
a
sudden
cessation
of
groans
from
the
interior
attracted
the
attention
of
all
doc
smith
arrived
at
that
juncture
and
found
the
boys
listening
intently
for
a
resumption
of
the
picturesque
profanity
it
was
some
time
before
the
crowd
became
large
enough
to
inspire
a
visit
to
the
interior
of
the
calaboose
as
became
his
dignity
bud
led
the
way
the
old
woman
unable
to
endure
the
pain
any
longer
and
knowing
full
well
that
her
days
were
bound
to
end
in
prison
had
managed
in
some
way
to
hang
herself
from
a
window
bar
beside
her
bed
using
a
twisted
bed
sheet
she
was
quite
dead
when
doc
made
the
examination
a
committee
of
the
whole
started
at
once
to
notify
anderson
crow
for
a
minute
it
looked
as
though
the
jail
would
be
left
entirely
unguarded
but
bud
loyally
returned
to
his
post
reinforced
by
roscoe
and
the
doctor
upon
crow
arrival
at
the
jail
affairs
assumed
some
aspect
of
order
he
first
locked
the
grate
doors
thereby
keeping
the
fiery
david
from
coming
out
to
see
his
mother
before
they
cut
her
down
a
messenger
was
sent
for
the
coroner
at
boggs
city
and
then
the
big
body
was
released
from
its
last
hanging
place
doggone
but
this
is
a
busy
day
fer
me
said
anderson
i
wo
have
time
to
pump
them
fellers
till
this
evenin
but
i
guess
they
keep
that
blootch
i
was
just
goin
to
ask
bud
if

still
in
there
said
blootch

anderson
in
quick
alarm

replied
bud
with
a
mighty
swelling
of
the
chest
even
blootch
envied
him
she
been
dead
jest
an
hour
an
seven
minutes

anderson
gingerly
touching
the
dead
woman
wrist
doggone
i
glad
o
one
thing
what

anderson
we
wo

to
set

but
we

her
like
as
not
said
isaac
porter
yes
said
anderson
reflectively
she
have
to
be
buried
but
but
and
here
his
face
lightened
up
in
relief
not
fer
a
day
er
two
so
what
the
use
worryin
when
the
coroner
arrived
soon
after
six
a
jury
was
empanelled
and
witnesses
sworn
in
ten
minutes
a
verdict
of
suicide
was
returned
and
the
coroner
was
on
his
way
back
to
boggs
city
he
did
not
even
know
that
a
hip
had
been
dislocated
anderson
insisted
upon
a
examination
but
was
laughed
out
of
countenance
by
the
officious
i
voted
fer
that
fool
last
november
said
anderson
wrathfully
as
the
coroner
drove
off
but
you
kick
the
daylights
out
of
me
if
i
ever
do
it
look
out
there
bud
what
in
thunder

his

full
of

nothin

eat
sence
last
night
and
i
hungry
well

dark

explained
anderson
suddenly
shuffling
into
the
jail
i
guess
i
put
them
fellers
through
the
sweat
box
the
demanded
george
ray
the
box
cai
you
hear
i
thought
you
used
a
cell
thunderation
no
nobody
but
country
jakes
call
it
a
cell
said
anderson
in
fine
scorn
the
three
prisoners
scowled
at
him
so
fiercely
and
snarled
so
vindictively
when
they
asked
him
if
they
were
to
be
starved
to
death
that
poor
anderson
hurried
home
and
commanded
his
wife
to
pack
a
baskit
of
bread
and
butter
an
things
fer
the
prisoners
it
was
nine
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
venture
back
to
the
calaboose
with
his
basket
he
spent
the
intervening
hours
in
telling
rosalie
and
bonner
about
the
shocking
incident
at
the
jail
and
in
absorbing
advice
from
the
young
man
from
boston
i
like
to
go
with
you
to
see
those
fellows
crow
was
rueful
lament
but
the
doctor
says
i
must
be
quiet
until
this
confounded
thing
heals
a
bit
together
i
think
we
could
bluff
the
whole
story
out
of
those
scoundrels
oh
never
you
fear
said
the
marshal
i
learn
all
there
is
to
be
learnt
you
jest
ask
alf
reesling
what
kind
of
a
pumper
i
am
who
is
alf
reesling
ai
you
heerd
of
him
in
boston
why
every
temperance
lecturer
that
comes
here
says
he
the
biggest
drunkard
in
the
world
i
supposed
his
reputation
had
got
to
boston
by
this
time
he
been
sober
only
once
in
years
is
it
possible
that
was
when
his
wife
died
he
said
he
felt
so
good
it
necessary
to
get
drunk
well
i
tell
you
all
about
it
when
i
come
back
do
worry
no
more
rosalie
i
find
out
who
back
of
this
business
an
then
we
know
all
about
you
it
a
long
lane
that
has
no
turn
them
prisoners
must
be
mighty
near
starved
to
death
by
this
time
anderson
warned
crow
doggone
that
so
he
cried
and
hustled
out
into
the
night
the
calaboose
was
almost
totally
dark
quite
so
had
it
not
been
for
the
single
lamp
that
burned
in
the
office
where
the
body
of
the
old
woman
was
lying
two
or
three
timid
citizens
stood
afar
off
in
front
of
thompson
feed
yard
looking
with
awe
upon
the
dungeon
keep
footsteps
grew
slower
and
more
halting
as
they
approached
the
entrance
to
the
forbidding
square
of
black
the
snow
creaked
resoundingly
under
his
heels
and
the
chill
wind
nipped
his
muffless
ears
with
a
spitefulness
that
annoyed
in
fact
he
became
so
incensed
that
he
set
his
basket
down
and
slapped
his
ears
vigorously
for
some
minutes
before
resuming
his
slow
progress
he
hated
the
thought
of
going
in
where
the
dead
woman
lay
suddenly
he
made
up
his
mind
that
a
confession
from
the
men
would
be
worthless
unless
he
had
ear
witnesses
to
substantiate
it
in
court
without
further
deliberation
he
retraced
his
steps
hurriedly
to
lamson
store
where
after
half
an
hour
conversation
on
the
topics
of
the
day
he
deputised
the
entire
crowd
to
accompany
him
to
the
jail
where
bud
he
demanded
sharply
home
in
bed
poor
child
said
old
borton
well
doggone
his
ornery
hide
why
ai
he
here
to
began
anderson
but
checked
himself
in
time
to
prevent
the
crowd
from
seeing
that
he
expected
bud
to
act
as
leader
in
the
expedition
i
wanted
him
to
jot
down
notes
he
substituted
editor
squires
volunteered
to
act
as
secretary
prompter
interpreter
and
everything
else
that
his
scoffing
tongue
could
utter
well
go
ahead
then
said
anderson
pushing
him
forward
harry
led
the
party
down
the
dark
street
with
more
rapidity
than
seemed
necessary
few
in
the
crowd
could
keep
pace
with
him
a
majority
fell
hopelessly
behind
in
fact
straight
into
the
office
walked
harry
closely
followed
by
blootch
and
the
marshal
maude
looking
like
a
monument
of
sheets
still
occupied
the
centre
of
the
floor
without
a
word
the
party
filed
past
the
gruesome
silent
thing
and
into
the
jail
corridor
it
was
as
dark
as
erebus
in
the
barred
section
of
the
prison
a
cold
draft
of
air
flew
into
the
faces
of
the
visitors
come
here
you
fellers
called
anderson
bravely
into
the
darkness
but
there
was
no
response
from
the
prisoners
for
the
very
good
reason
that
some
hours
earlier
they
had
calmly
removed
a
window
from
its
moorings
and
by
this
time
were
much
too
far
away
to
answer
questions
chapter
xxiv
the
flight
of
the
kidnapers
searching
parties
were
organised
and
sent
out
to
scour
the
country
late
as
it
was
swift
riders
gave
the
alarm
along
every
roadway
and
the
station
agent
telegraphed
the
news
into
every
section
of
the
land
at
boggs
city
the
sheriff
berating
anderson
crow
for
a
fool
and
tinkletown
for
an
lunatic
asylum
sent
his
deputies
down
to
assist
in
the
pursuit
the
marshal
himself
undertook
to
lead
each
separate
and
distinct
posse
he
was
so
overwhelmed
by
the
magnitude
of
his
misfortune
that
it
is
no
wonder
his
brain
whirled
widely
enough
to
encompass
the
whole
enterprise
be
it
said
to
the
credit
of
tinkletown
her
citizens
made
every
reasonable
effort
to
recapture
the
men
the
few
hundred
men
of
the
town
rallied
to
the
support
of
their
marshal
and
the
law
and
there
was
not
one
who
refused
to
turn
out
in
the
cold
night
air
for
a
sweeping
search
of
the
woods
and
fields
rosalie
who
had
been
awakened
early
in
the
evening
by
crow
noisy
preparations
for
the
pursuit
came
downstairs
and
instantly
lost
all
desire
to
sleep
bonner
was
lying
on
a
couch
in
the
which
now
served
as
a
temporary
bedchamber
if
you
just
hand
me
those
revolvers
crow
said
he
indicating
the
two
big
automatics
he
had
taken
from
davy
and
bill
i
stand
guard
over
the
house
as
best
i
can
while
you
away
stand
guard
what
fer
nobody
goin
to
steal
the
house
we
should
not
forget
that
these
same
rascals
may
take
it
into
their
heads
to
double
on
their
tracks
and
try
to
carry
miss
gray
away
again
with
her
in
their
possession
they
receive
their
pay
without
her
their
work
will
have
been
for
nothing
it
is
a
desperate
crowd
and
they
may
think
the
plan
at
least
worth
trying
rosalie
grateful
beaming
glance
sent
a
quiver
that
was
not
of
pain
through
bonner
frame
do
worry
about
that
said
the
marshal
we
have
shot
to
pieces
inside
of
an
hour
an
a
half
anderson
i
want
you
to
be
very
careful
with
that
horse
pistol
said
his
wife
nervously
it
ai
been
shot
off
sence
the
war
an
like
as
not
it
kill
you
from
behind
gosh
blast
it
eva
roared
anderson
do
you
suppose
i
know
which
end
to
shoot
with
and
away
he
rushed
in
great
dudgeon
edna
crow
sat
at
the
front
window
keeping
watch
for
hours
she
reported
to
the
other
members
of
the
household
as
each
scurrying
band
of
searchers
passed
the
place
bonner
commanded
rosalie
to
keep
away
from
the
windows
fearing
a
shot
from
the
outside
from
time
to
time
roscoe
replenished
the
big
blaze
in
the
fireplace
it
was
cosey
in
the
even
though
the
strain
upon
its
occupants
was
trying
in
the
extreme
great
excitement
came
to
them
when
the
figure
of
a
man
was
seen
to
drop
to
the
walk
near
the
front
gate
at
first
it
was
feared
that
one
of
the
bandits
injured
by
pursuers
had
fallen
to
die
but
the
mournful
calls
for
help
that
soon
came
from
the
sidewalk
were
more
or
less
reassuring
the
prostrate
figure
had
a
queer
habit
from
time
to
time
of
raising
itself
high
enough
to
peer
between
the
pickets
of
the
fence
and
each
succeeding
shout
seemed
more
vigorous
than
the
others
finally
they
became
impatient
and
then
full
of
wrath
it
was
evident
that
the
stranger
resented
the
inhospitality
of
the
house
who
are
you
called
edna
opening
the
window
ever
so
slightly
whereupon
the
man
at
the
gate
sank
to
the
ground
and
groaned
with
splendid
misery
it
me
he
replied
who
me
little
i
think
i
dyin
there
was
a
hurried
consultation
indoors
and
then
roscoe
bravely
ventured
out
to
the
sidewalk
are
you
shot
he
asked
in
trembling
tones
no
i
just
wounded
is
rosalie
in
there
yep
she
i
guess
i
go
in
then
dern
it
it
a
long
walk
from
our
house
over
here
i
guess
i
stay
all
night
if
i
do
get
better
have
to
stay
longer
i
ought
to
be
nursed
too
rosalie
playin
nurse
fer
bonner
volunteered
roscoe
still
blocking
the
gate
through
which
was
trying
to
wedge
himself
mr
who
bonner
well
said
after
a
moment
consideration
he
ought
to
be
moved
to
a
hospital
lem
me
lean
on
you
roscoe
i
ca
hardly
walk
my
arm
hurts
so
little
with
his
bandages
and
his
hobble
had
joined
in
the
expedition
and
was
not
to
be
deterred
until
faintness
overcame
him
and
he
dropped
by
the
wayside
he
was
taken
in
and
given
a
warm
chair
before
the
fire
one
long
look
at
bonner
and
the
newcomer
lapsed
into
a
stubborn
pout
he
groaned
occasionally
and
made
much
ado
over
his
condition
but
sourly
resented
any
approach
at
sympathy
finally
he
fell
asleep
in
the
chair
his
last
speech
being
to
the
effect
that
he
was
going
home
early
in
the
morning
if
he
had
to
drag
himself
every
foot
of
the
way
plainly
had
forgotten
miss
banks
in
the
sudden
revival
of
affection
for
rosalie
gray
the
course
of
true
love
did
not
run
smoothly
in
tinkletown
the
searchers
straggled
in
empty
handed
early
morning
found
most
of
them
asleep
at
their
homes
tucked
away
by
thankful
wives
and
with
the
promises
of
late
breakfasts
the
next
day
business
was
slow
in
asserting
its
claim
upon
public
attention
masculine
tinkletown
dozed
while
femininity
chattered
to
its
heart
content
there
was
much
to
talk
about
and
more
to
anticipate
the
officials
in
all
counties
contiguous
had
out
their
dragnets
and
word
was
expected
at
any
time
that
the
fugitives
had
fallen
into
their
hands
but
not
that
day
nor
the
next
nor
any
day
in
fact
did
news
come
of
their
capture
so
tinkletown
was
obliged
to
settle
back
into
a
state
of
tranquility
some
little
interest
was
aroused
when
the
town
board
ordered
the
calaboose
repaired
and
there
was
a
ripple
of
excitement
attached
to
the
funeral
of
the
only
kidnaper
in
captivity
it
was
necessary
to
postpone
the
oyster
supper
at
the
methodist
church
but
there
was
some
consolation
in
the
knowledge
that
it
would
soon
be
and
the
benighted
africans
would
not
need
the
money
for
winter
clothes
the
reception
at
the
minister
house
was
a
fizzle
he
was
warned
in
time
however
and
it
was
his
own
fault
that
he
received
no
more
than
a
jug
of
vinegar
two
loaves
of
bread
and
a
pound
of
honey
as
the
result
of
his
expectations
it
was
the
first
time
that
a
pound
party
had
proven
a
losing
enterprise
anderson
crow
maintained
a
relentless
search
for
the
desperadoes
he
refused
to
accept
wicker
bonner
theory
that
they
were
safe
in
the
city
of
new
york
it
was
his
own
opinion
that
they
were
still
in
the
neighbourhood
waiting
for
a
chance
to
exhume
the
body
of
davy
mother
and
make
off
with
it
do
try
to
tell
me
bonner
that
even
a
raskil
like
him
any
love
fer
his
mother
he
contended
davy
may
not
be
much
of
a
model
but
he
had
a
feelin
fer
the
woman
who
bore
him
an
do
you
fergit
it
why
daddy
crow
he
was
the
most
heartless
brute
in
the
world
cried
rosalie
i
seen
him
knock
her
down
more
than
once
and
kick
her
too
a
slip
of
the
memory
that
all
he
was
probably
thinkin
of
his
wife
if
he
has
one
at
a
public
meeting
the
town
board
was
condemned
for
its
failure
to
strengthen
the
jail
at
the
time
anderson
made
his
demand
three
years
before
what
the
use
in
me
catchin
thieves
and
so
forth
if
the
jail
hold
anderson
declared
i
cai
afford
to
waste
time
in
desperite
characters
down
if
the
town
board
ai
goin
to
obstruct
from
gittin
away
as
soon
as
the
sun
sits
what
the
use
i
like
to
know
where
the
justice
i
do
want
it
to
git
noised
aroun
that
the
way
we
hold
a
prisoner
is
to
have
him
commit
suicide
as
soon
as
he
arrested
fer
two
cents
i
resign
right
now
of
course
no
one
would
hear
to
that
as
a
result
nearly
five
hundred
dollars
was
voted
from
the
corporation
funds
to
strengthen
and
modernise
the
calaboose
it
was
the
sense
of
the
meeting
that
a
sweat
box
should
be
installed
under
crow
supervision
and
that
the
salary
should
be
increased
fifty
dollars
a
year
after
the
adoption
of
this
popular
resolution
crow
arose
and
solemnly
informed
the
people
that
their
faith
in
him
was
not
misplaced
he
threw
the
meeting
into
a
state
of
great
excitement
by
announcing
that
the
kidnapers
would
soon
be
in
the
toils
once
more
in
response
to
eager
queries
he
merely
stated
that
he
had
a
valuable
clew
which
could
not
be
divulged
without
detriment
to
the
cause
everybody
went
home
that
night
with
the
assurance
that
the
fugitives
would
soon
be
taken
anderson
promised
the
town
board
that
he
would
not
take
them
until
the
jail
was
repaired
it
was
almost
a
fortnight
before
wicker
bonner
was
able
to
walk
about
with
crutches
the
wound
in
his
leg
was
an
ugly
one
and
healed
slowly
his
uncle
the
congressman
sent
up
a
surgeon
from
new
york
but
that
worthy
approved
of
doc
smith
methods
and
abruptly
left
the
young
man
to
the
care
of
an
excellent
nurse
rosalie
gray
congressman
bonner
servants
came
over
every
day
or
two
with
books
newspapers
sweetmeats
and
fresh
supplies
from
the
city
but
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
get
any
satisfaction
from
the
young
man
in
reply
to
their
inquiries
as
to
when
he
expected
to
return
to
the
big
house
across
the
river
bonner
was
beginning
to
hate
the
thought
of
giving
up
readings
her
ministrations
and
the
no
uncertain
development
of
his
own
opinions
as
to
her
personal
attractiveness
i
do
know
when
i
be
able
to
walk
watkins
he
said
to
the
caretaker
i
afraid
my
heart
is
affected
bonner
enforced
presence
at
anderson
crow
home
was
the
source
of
extreme
annoyance
to
the
young
men
of
the
town
blootch
peabody
created
a
frightful
scandal
by
getting
boiling
drunk
toward
the
end
of
the
week
so
great
was
his
dejection
as
it
was
his
first
real
spree
he
did
not
recover
from
the
effect
for
three
days
he
then
took
the
pledge
and
talked
about
the
evils
of
strong
drink
with
so
much
feeling
at
prayer
meeting
that
the
women
of
the
town
inaugurated
a
movement
to
stop
the
sale
of
liquor
in
the
town
as
peabody
drug
store
was
the
only
place
where
whiskey
could
be
obtained
blootch
soon
saw
the
error
of
his
ways
and
came
down
from
his
pedestal
to
mend
them
bonner
was
a
friend
in
need
to
anderson
crow
the
two
were
in
consultation
half
of
the
time
and
the
young
man
opinions
were
not
to
be
disregarded
he
advanced
a
theory
concerning
the
motives
of
the
leader
in
the
plot
to
send
rosalie
into
an
exile
from
which
she
was
not
expected
to
return
it
was
his
belief
that
the
person
who
abandoned
her
as
a
babe
was
actuated
by
the
desire
to
possess
a
fortune
which
should
have
been
the
child
the
conditions
attending
the
final
disposition
of
this
fortune
doubtless
were
such
as
to
make
it
unwise
to
destroy
the
girl
life
the
plotter
whatever
his
or
her
relation
to
the
child
may
have
been
must
have
felt
that
a
time
might
come
when
the
existence
of
the
real
heiress
would
be
necessary
either
such
a
fear
was
the
inspiration
or
the
relationship
was
so
dear
that
the
heart
of
the
was
full
of
love
for
the
innocent
victim
who
is
to
say
miss
gray
said
bonner
one
night
as
they
sat
before
the
fire
that
the
woman
who
left
you
with
crow
was
not
your
own
mother
suppose
that
a
vast
estate
was
to
be
yours
in
trust
after
the
death
of
some
rich
relative
say
grandparent
it
would
naturally
mean
that
some
one
else
resented
this
bequest
and
probably
with
some
justice
the
property
was
to
become
your
own
when
you
attained
a
certain
age
let
us
say
do
you
see
that
the
day
would
rob
the
disinherited
person
of
every
hope
to
retain
the
fortune
even
a
mother
might
be
tempted
for
ambitious
reasons
to
go
to
extreme
measures
to
secure
the
fortune
for
herself
or
she
might
have
been
influenced
by
a
will
stronger
than
her
own
the
will
of
an
unscrupulous
man
there
are
many
contingencies
all
probable
as
you
choose
to
analyse
them
but
why
should
this
person
wish
to
banish
me
from
the
country
altogether
i
am
no
more
dangerous
here
than
i
would
be
anywhere
in
europe
and
then
think
of
the
means
they
would
have
employed
to
get
me
away
from
tinkletown
have
i
not
been
lost
to
the
world
for
years
why
true
but
i
am
quite
convinced
and
i
think
crow
agrees
with
me
that
the
recent
move
was
made
necessary
by
the
demands
of
one
whose
heart
is
not
interested
but
whose
hand
wields
the
sceptre
of
power
over
the
love
which
tries
to
shield
you
any
other
would
have
cut
off
your
life
at
the
beginning
that
my
idee
agreed
anderson
solemnly
i
do
want
the
fortune
cried
rosalie
i
am
happy
here
why
they
let
me
alone
i
tell
you
miss
gray
unless
something
happens
to
prevent
it
that
woman
will
some
day
give
you
back
your
own
your
fortune
and
your
name
i
ca
believe
it
bonner
it
is
too
much
like
a
dream
to
me
well
doggone
it
rosalie
dreams
do
last
forever
broke
in
anderson
crow
you
got
to
wake
up
some
time
do
you
see
chapter
xxv
as
the
heart
grows
older
bonner
eagerness
to
begin
probing
into
the
mystery
grew
as
his
strength
came
back
to
him
he
volunteered
to
interest
his
uncle
in
the
matter
and
through
him
to
begin
a
systematic
effort
to
unravel
the
tangled
ends
of
rosalie
life
money
was
not
to
be
spared
time
and
intelligence
were
to
be
devoted
to
the
cause
he
knew
that
rosalie
was
in
reality
a
creature
of
good
birth
and
worthy
of
the
name
that
any
man
might
seek
to
bestow
upon
her
a
name
given
in
love
by
a
man
to
the
woman
who
would
share
it
with
him
forever
the
days
and
nights
were
teaching
him
the
sacredness
of
a
growing
attachment
he
was
not
closing
his
eyes
to
the
truth
it
was
quite
as
impossible
for
big
worldly
wick
bonner
to
be
near
her
and
not
fall
a
victim
as
it
was
for
the
crude
humble
youth
of
tinkletown
his
heart
was
just
as
fragile
as
theirs
when
it
bared
itself
to
her
attack
her
beauty
attracted
him
her
natural
refinement
of
character
appealed
to
him
her
pureness
her
tenderness
her
goodness
wrought
havoc
with
his
impressions
fresh
bright
as
as
the
june
sunshine
she
was
a
revelation
to
him
to
bonner
who
had
known
her
sex
in
all
its
environments
his
heart
was
full
of
her
day
and
night
for
day
and
night
he
was
wondering
whether
she
could
care
for
him
as
he
knew
he
was
coming
to
care
for
her
one
day
he
received
a
telegram
it
was
from
his
mother
and
his
sister
who
had
just
reached
boston
from
bermuda
and
it
carried
the
brief
though
emphatic
information
that
they
were
starting
to
tinkletown
to
nurse
and
care
for
him
bonner
was
thrown
into
a
panic
he
realised
in
the
instant
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
come
to
home
and
he
knew
they
could
not
be
deceived
as
to
his
real
condition
his
mother
would
naturally
insist
upon
his
going
at
once
to
bonner
place
across
the
river
and
on
to
boston
as
soon
as
he
was
able
his
clever
sister
would
see
through
his
motives
like
a
flash
of
lightning
young
bonner
loved
them
but
he
was
distinctly
bored
by
the
prospect
of
their
coming
in
some
haste
and
confusion
he
sent
for
doc
smith
doctor
how
soon
will
i
be
able
to
navigate
he
asked
anxiously
right
now
you
do
say
so
i
do
feel
strong
you
know
well
your
leg
doing
well
and
all
danger
is
past
of
course
you
wo
be
as
spry
as
usual
for
some
time
and
you
ca
walk
without
crutches
but
i
do
see
any
sense
in
your
loafing
around
here
on
that
account
you
be
safe
to
go
at
any
time
mr
bonner
look
here
doctor
i
afraid
to
change
doctors
you
handled
this
case
mighty
well
and
if
i
went
to
some
other
chap
he
might
undo
it
all
i
made
up
my
mind
to
have
you
look
out
for
me
until
this
wound
is
completely
healed
that
all
right
now
i
know
what
i
talking
about
i
take
no
chances
how
long
will
it
be
until
it
is
completely
healed
a
couple
of
weeks
i
suppose
well
i
stay
right
here
and
have
you
look
at
it
every
day
it
too
serious
a
matter
for
me
to
trifle
with
by
the
way
my
mother
is
coming
up
and
i
dare
say
she
want
me
to
go
to
boston
our
family
doctor
is
an
old
fossil
and
i
do
like
to
trust
him
with
this
thing
you
be
doing
me
a
favour
doctor
if
you
keep
me
here
until
i
thoroughly
well
i
intend
to
tell
my
mother
that
it
will
not
be
wise
to
move
me
until
all
danger
of
blood
poisoning
is
past
blood
poisoning
there
no
danger
now
sir
you
never
can
tell
said
bonner
sagely
but
i
be
a
perfect
fool
bonner
if
there
were
still
danger
of
that
complained
the
doctor
what
sort
of
a
doctor
would
they
consider
me
they
certainly
give
you
credit
for
being
careful
and
that
what
appeals
to
a
mother
you
know
said
bonner
still
more
sagely
besides
it
leg
doctor
and
i
have
it
treated
my
way
i
think
a
couple
of
weeks
more
under
your
care
will
put
me
straight
mother
has
to
consider
me
that
all
i
wish
you
stop
in
and
change
these
bandages
doctor
if
you
do
mind
doc
smith
was
not
slow
he
saw
more
than
bonner
thought
so
he
winked
to
himself
as
he
crossed
over
to
his
office
at
the
corner
he
met
anderson
crow
say
anderson
he
said
half
chuckling
that
young
bonner
has
had
a
relapse
thunderation
he
ca
be
moved
for
a
week
or
two
will
you
have
to
cut
it
off
the
leg
certainly
that
the
only
thing
that
pains
him
ai
it
i
think
not
i
going
to
put
his
heart
in
a
sling
said
smith
laughing
heartily
at
what
he
thought
would
be
taken
as
a
brilliant
piece
of
jesting
but
he
erred
anderson
went
home
in
a
great
flurry
and
privately
cautioned
every
member
of
the
household
including
rosalie
to
treat
bonner
with
every
consideration
as
his
heart
was
weak
and
liable
to
give
him
great
trouble
above
all
he
cautioned
them
to
keep
the
distressing
news
from
bonner
it
would
discourage
him
mightily
for
a
full
week
anderson
watched
bonner
with
anxious
eyes
writhing
every
time
the
big
fellow
exerted
himself
groaning
when
he
gave
vent
to
his
hearty
laugh
have
you
heard
anything
asked
bonner
with
faithful
regularity
when
anderson
came
home
each
night
he
referred
to
the
chase
for
the
fugitives
nothin
worth
while
replied
anderson
dismally
uncle
jimmy
borton
had
a
letter
from
albany
an
his
said
three
strange
men
had
been
seen
in
the
albany
depot
the
other
day
i
had
uncle
jimmy
write
an
ast
him
if
he
had
seen
anybody
answerin
the
description
you
know
but
the
three
men
he
spoke
of
took
a
train
for
new
york
so
i
suppose
they
lost
by
this
time
it
the
most
bafflin
case
i
ever
worked
on
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
the
real
leader
was
in
this
neighbourhood
at
the
time
in
boggs
city
let
us
say
according
to
rosa
miss
story
the
man
sam
went
out
nightly
for
instructions
well
he
either
went
to
boggs
city
or
to
a
meeting
place
agreed
upon
between
him
and
his
superior
it
is
possible
that
he
saw
this
person
on
the
very
night
of
my
own
adventure
now
the
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
find
out
if
a
stranger
was
seen
in
these
parts
on
that
night
the
hotel
registers
in
boggs
city
may
give
us
a
clew
if
you
do
mind
crow
i
have
this
new
york
detective
who
is
coming
up
take
a
look
into
this
phase
of
the
case
it
wo
interfere
with
your
plans
will
it
asked
bonner
always
considerate
of
the
feelings
of
the
old
marshal
not
at
all
an
i
help
him
all
i
can
sir
responded
anderson
magnanimously
here
eva
here
a
letter
fer
rosalie
it
the
second
she
had
from
new
york
in
three
days
it
from
miss
banks
they
correspond
anderson
said
crow
and
say
eva
i
decided
on
one
thing
we
got
to
calculate
on
gittin
along
without
that
thousand
dollars
after
this
why
an
der
son
crow
yep
we
goin
to
find
her
folks
no
matter
if
we
do
have
to
give
up
the
thousand
it
no
right
she
be
in
march
i
have
to
settle
the
guardeenship
business
anyhow
but
doggone
it
bonner
she
says
she
wo
take
the
money
we
saved
fer
her
she
has
told
me
as
much
crow
i
think
she
partly
right
if
she
takes
my
advice
she
will
divide
it
with
you
you
are
entitled
to
all
of
it
you
know
it
was
to
be
your
pay
and
she
will
not
listen
to
your
plan
to
give
all
of
it
to
her
still
i
feel
that
she
should
not
be
penniless
at
this
time
she
may
never
need
it
she
certainly
will
not
as
long
as
you
are
alive
but
it
seems
a
wise
thing
for
her
to
be
protected
against
emergencies
but
i
dare
say
you
can
arrange
that
between
yourselves
i
have
no
right
to
interfere
was
there
any
mail
for
me
yep
i
almost
fergot
to
fork
it
over
here
one
from
your
mother
i
figger
this
is
from
your
sister
an
here
one
from
your
your
sweetheart
i
reckon
i
deduce
all
this
by
sizin
up
the
and
he
went
on
to
tell
how
he
reached
his
conclusions
all
of
which
were
wrong
they
were
invitations
to
social
affairs
in
boston
but
i
got
important
to
tell
you
bonner
i
think
a
trap
is
bein
set
fer
me
by
the
desperadoes
we
after
i
guess
i
gittin
too
hot
on
their
trail
i
had
an
ananymous
letter
a
what
ananymous
letter
did
you
ever
hear
of
one
this
one
was
writ
fer
the
express
purpose
of
lurin
me
into
a
trap
they
want
to
git
me
out
of
the
way
but
i
fool
i
not
pay
any
attention
to
it
goodness
anderson
i
bet
you
be
assassinated
yet
cried
his
poor
wife
i
wish
you
give
up
chasin
people
down
may
i
have
a
look
at
the
letter
mr
crow
asked
bonner
anderson
stealthily
drew
the
square
envelope
from
his
inside
pocket
and
passed
it
over
they
got
to
git
up
purty
early
to
ketch
me
asleep
he
said
proudly
bonner
drew
the
enclosure
from
the
envelope
as
he
read
his
eyes
twinkled
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
twitched
but
his
face
was
politely
sober
as
he
handed
the
missive
back
to
the
marshal
looks
like
a
trap
do
it
said
anderson
you
see
there
ai
no
signature
the
raskils
were
afraid
to
sign
a
name
i
would
say
anything
to
miss
gray
about
this
if
i
were
you
crow
it
might
disturb
her
you
know
said
bonner
that
means
you
too
eva
commanded
anderson
in
turn
do
worry
the
girl
she
must
know
anything
about
this
i
do
think
it
a
trap
remarked
eva
as
she
finished
reading
the
missive
bonner
took
this
opportunity
to
laugh
heartily
he
had
held
it
back
as
long
as
possible
what
anderson
described
as
an
ananymous
letter
was
nothing
more
than
a
polite
formal
invitation
to
attend
a
house
warming
at
colonel
randall
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
it
read
and
randall
request
the
honour
of
your
presence
at
a
house
warming
friday
evening
january
at
eight
it
is
addressed
to
me
too
anderson
said
his
wife
pointing
to
the
envelope
it
the
new
house
they
finished
last
fall

letter
fiddlesticks
i
bet
there
one
at
the
fer
each
one
of
the
girls
roscoe
got
some
of
the
mail
murmured
the
marshal
sheepishly
where
is
that
infernal
boy
he
oughter
be
strapped
good
and
hard
fer
back
letters
like
this
growled
he
eager
to
run
the
subject
into
another
channel
after
pondering
all
evening
he
screwed
up
the
courage
and
asked
bonner
not
to
tell
any
one
of
his
error
in
regard
to
the
invitation
roscoe
produced
invitations
for
his
sister
and
rosalie
he
furthermore
announced
that
half
the
people
in
town
had
received
them
there
a
telegram
comin
up
fer
you
after
a
while
bonner
he
said
bud
out
delivering
one
to
grimes
and
he
going
to
stop
here
on
the
way
back
i
was
at
the
station
when
it
come
in
it
from
your
ma
and
it
says
she
be
over
from
boggs
city
early
in
the
morning
thanks
roscoe
said
bonner
with
an
amused
glance
at
rosalie
saved
me
the
trouble
of
reading
it
they
are
coming
said
rosalie
long
afterward
as
the
last
of
the
crows
straggled
off
to
bed
you
will
have
to
go
away
with
them
wo
you
i
an
awful
nuisance
about
here
i
fancy
and
you
be
glad
to
be
rid
of
me
he
said
softly
his
gaze
on
the
blazing
no
more
so
than
you
will
be
to
go
she
said
so
coolly
that
his
pride
suffered
a
distinct
shock
he
stole
a
shy
glance
at
the
face
of
the
girl
opposite
it
was
as
calm
and
serene
as
a
may
morning
her
eyes
likewise
were
gazing
into
the
blaze
and
her
fingers
were
idly
toying
with
the
fringe
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
by
george
he
thought
a
weakness
assailing
his
heart
suddenly
i
do
believe
she

a
rap
chapter

the
left
ventricle
the
next
day
bonner
and
miss
bonner
descended
upon
tinkletown
they
were
driven
over
from
boggs
city
in
an
automobile
and
their
advent
caused
a
new
thrill
of
excitement
in
town
half
of
the
women
in
tinkletown
found
excuse
to
walk
past
crow
home
some
time
during
the
day
and
not
a
few
of
them
called
to
pay
their
respects
to
crow
whether
they
owed
them
or
not
much
to
that
estimable
discomfiture
wicker
mother
was
a
handsome
aristocratic
woman
with
a
pedigree
reaching
back
to
babylon
or
some
other
historic
starting
place
her
ancestors
were
tories
at
the
time
of
the
american
revolution
and
she
was
proud
of
it
her
husband
forefathers
had
shot
a
few
british
in
those
days
it
is
true
and
had
successfully
chased
some
of
her
own
ancestors
over
to
long
island
but
that
did
not
matter
in
these
twentieth
century
days
bonner
long
since
had
gone
to
the
tomb
and
his
widow
at
fifty
was
quite
the
queen
of
all
she
surveyed
which
was
not
inconsiderable
the
bonners
were
rich
in
worldly
possessions
rich
in
social
position
rich
in
traditions
the
daughter
just
out
in
society
was
a
pretty
girl
several
years
younger
than
wicker
she
was
the
idol
of
his
heart
this
slip
of
a
girl
had
been
to
him
the
brightest
wittiest
and
prettiest
girl
in
all
the
world
now
he
was
wondering
how
the
other
girl
who
was
not
his
sister
would
compare
with
her
when
they
stood
together
before
him
naturally
crow
and
her
daughters
sank
into
a
nervous
panic
as
soon
as
these
fashionable
women
from
boston
set
foot
inside
the
humble
home
they
lost
what
little
they
had
managed
to
acquire
and
floundered
miserably
through
the
preliminaries
but
calm
sweet
and
composed
as
the
most
fastidious
would
require
rosalie
greeted
the
visitors
without
a
shadow
of
confusion
or
a
sign
of
gaucherie
bonner
felt
a
thrill
of
joy
and
pride
as
he
took
note
of
the
look
of
surprise
that
crept
into
his
mother
face
a
surprise
that
did
not
diminish
as
the
girl
went
through
her
unconscious
test
by
george
he
cried
jubilantly
to
himself
she
something
to
be
proud
of
she
a
queen
later
in
the
day
after
the
humble
though
imposing
lunch
the
paradox
was
permissible
in
tinkletown
bonner
found
time
and
opportunity
to
express
her
surprise
and
her
approval
to
him
with
the
insight
of
the
real
aristocrat
she
was
not
blind
to
the
charms
of
the
girl
who
blossomed
like
a
rose
in
this
patch
of
nature
the
tact
which
impelled
rosalie
to
withdraw
herself
and
all
of
the
crows
from
the
house
giving
the
bonners
an
opportunity
to
be
together
undisturbed
did
not
escape
the
clever
woman
of
the
world
she
is
remarkable
wicker
tell
me
about
her
why
does
she
happen
to
be
living
in
this
wretched
town
and
among
such
people
whereupon
bonner
rushed
into
a
detailed
and
somewhat
lengthy
history
of
the
mysterious
miss
gray
repeating
it
as
it
had
come
to
him
from
her
own
frank
lips
but
with
embellishments
of
his
own
that
would
have
brought
the
red
to
her
cheeks
could
she
have
heard
them
his
interest
was
not
assumed
his
sister
was
fascinated
by
the
recital
who
knows
she
cried
her
dark
eyes
sparkling
she
may
be
an
heiress
to
millions
or
a
princess
of
the
royal
blood
amended
her
mother
with
an
enthusiasm
that
was
uncommon
blood
alone
has
made
this
girl
what
she
is
heaven
knows
that
billions
or
trillions
could
not
have
overcome
the
influences
of
a
lifetime
spent
in
in
winkletown
or
is
that
the
name
it
does
matter
wicker
any
name
will
satisfy
frankly
i
am
interested
in
the
girl
it
is
a
crime
to
permit
her
to
vegetate
and
die
in
a
place
like
this
but
mother
she
loves
these
people
protested
bonner
lifelessly
they
have
been
kind
to
her
all
these
years
they
have
been
parents
protectors
and
they
have
been
well
paid
for
it
my
son
please
do
not
misunderstand
me
i
am
not
planning
to
take
her
off
their
hands
i
am
not
going
to
reconstruct
her
sphere
in
life
not
by
any
means
i
am
merely
saying
that
it
is
a
crime
for
her
to
be
penned
up
for
life
in
this
this
desert
i
doubt
very
much
whether
her
parentage
will
ever
be
known
and
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
that
it
is
to
be
still
i
am
interested
mamma
i
think
it
would
be
very
nice
to
ask
her
to
come
to
boston
for
a
week
or
two
do
you
suggested
edith
bonner
warmly
but
doubtfully
bully
exclaimed
wicker
forgetting
in
his
excitement
that
he
was
a
cripple
have
her
come
on
to
stop
a
while
with
you
ede
it
will
be
a
great
treat
for
her
and
by
george
i
inclined
to
think
it
maybe
somewhat
beneficial
to
us
your
enthusiasm
is
beautiful
wicker
said
his
mother
perfectly
unruffled
i
have
no
doubt
you
think
boston
would
be
benefited
too
now
you
know
mother
it
not
just
like
you
to
be
snippish
said
he
easily
besides
after
living
a
while
in
other
parts
of
the
world
beginning
to
feel
that
population
is
not
the
only
thing
about
boston
that
can
be
enlarged
it
all
very
nice
to
pave
our
streets
with
intellect
so
that
we
ca
stray
from
our
own
footsteps
but
i
rather
like
the
idea
of
losing
my
way
once
in
a
while
even
if
i
have
to
look
at
the
same
common
old
sky
up
there
that
the
rest
of
the
world
looks
at
do
you
know
i
learned
recently
that
the
same
sun
that
shines
on
boston
also
radiates
for
the
rest
of
the
world
yes
it
shines
in
tinkletown
agreed
his
mother
serenely
but
my
dear
turning
to
her
daughter
i
think
you
would
better
wait
a
while
before
extending
the
invitation
there
is
no
excuse
for
rushing
into
the
unknown
let
time
have
a
chance
by
jove
mother
you
talk
sometimes
like
anderson
crow
he
often
says
things
like
that
cried
wicker
delightedly
dear
me
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
wicker
well
you
like
old
anderson
he
a
jewel
i
dare
say
an
emerald
no
no
that
was
not
fair
or
kind
wicker
i
unsay
it
crow
and
all
of
them
have
been
good
to
you
forgive
me
the
sarcasm
crow
is
perfectly
impossible
but
i
like
him
he
has
a
heart
and
that
is
more
than
most
of
us
can
say
and
now
let
us
return
to
earth
once
more
when
will
you
be
ready
to
start
for
boston
heavens
no
i
not
to
be
moved
for
quite
a
long
time
danger
of
gangrene
or
something
of
the
sort
it
astonishing
mother
what
capable
men
these
country
doctors
are
smith
is
something
of
a
marvel
he
he
saved
my
leg
my
boy
you
do
mean
that
his
mother
was
saying
her
voice
trembling
yes
that
what
i
mean
i
all
right
now
but
of
course
i
shall
be
very
careful
for
a
couple
of
weeks
one
ca
tell
you
know
blood
poisoning
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
let
not
talk
of
it
gruesome
indeed
it
is
you
must
be
extremely
careful
wicker
promise
me
that
you
will
do
nothing
foolish
do
use
your
leg
until
the
doctor
but
i
have
something
better
we
will
send
for
j
he
can
run
up
from
boston
two
or
three
times
nothing
of
the
sort
mother
nonsense
smith
knows
more
in
a
minute
than
j
does
in
a
month
he
handling
the
case
exactly
as
i
want
him
to
let
well
enough
alone
say
i
you
know
j
always
wants
to
amputate
everything
that
can
be
cut
or
sawed
off
for
heaven
sake
do
let
him
try
it
on
me
i
need
my
legs
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
that
bonner
was
completely
won
over
by
this
argument
she
commanded
him
to
stay
where
he
was
until
it
was
perfectly
safe
to
be
moved
across
the
river
where
he
could
recuperate
before
venturing
into
the
city
of
his
birth
moreover
she
announced
that
edith
and
she
would
remain
in
boggs
city
until
he
was
quite
out
of
danger
driving
over
every
day
in
their
chartered
automobile
it
suddenly
struck
bonner
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
bribe
doc
smith
and
the
entire
crow
family
if
he
was
to
maintain
his
position
as
an
invalid
doc
smith
when
put
to
the
test
lied
ably
in
behalf
of
his
client
he
refused
to
call
him
his
patient
and
bonner
was
convinced
crow
and
eva
vigorously
protested
that
the
young
man
would
not
be
a
mite
of
trouble
and
that
he
could
stay
as
long
as
he
liked
he
a
gentleman
bonner
announced
the
marshal
as
if
the
mother
was
being
made
aware
of
the
fact
for
the
first
time
crow
an
me
have
talked
it
over
an
i
know
what
i
talkin
about
he
a
perfect
gentleman
thank
you
crow
i
am
happy
to
hear
you
say
that
said
bonner
with
fine
tact
you
will
not
mind
if
he
stops
here
a
while
longer
then
i
should
say
not
if
he
take
the
job
i
him
deputy
marshal
i
like
a
picture
of
you
with
the
badge
and
uniform
wick
said
edith
with
banter
just
before
the
two
ladies
left
for
boggs
city
that
evening
bonner
managed
to
say
something
to
edith
say
ede
i
think
it
would
be
uncommonly
decent
of
you
to
ask
miss
gray
down
to
boston
this
spring
you
like
her
wicker
if
it
were
not
so
awfully
common
i
laugh
in
my
sleeve
said
she
surveying
him
with
a
calm
scrutiny
that
disconcerted
i
born
yesterday
you
know
mother
was
perhaps
but
not
your
dear
little
sister
cheer
up
brother
you
get
over
it
just
like
all
the
rest
i
ask
her
to
come
but
please
do
frown
like
that
i
suspect
something
during
the
many
little
automobile
excursions
that
the
two
girls
enjoyed
during
those
few
days
in
tinkletown
miss
bonner
found
much
to
love
in
rosalie
much
to
esteem
and
a
great
deal
to
anticipate
purposely
she
set
about
to
learn
by
deduction
just
what
rosalie
feelings
were
for
the
big
brother
she
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
discover
the
telltale
signs
of
a
real
but
secret
affection
on
rosalie
part
but
she
was
on
the
contrary
amazed
and
not
a
little
chagrined
to
have
the
young
girl
meet
every
advance
with
a
joyous
candour
that
definitely
set
aside
any
possibility
of
love
for
the
supposedly
irresistible
brother
miss
edith
mind
was
quite
at
rest
but
with
the
arrogant
pride
of
a
sister
she
resented
the
fact
that
any
one
could
know
this
cherished
brother
and
not
fall
a
victim
perversely
she
would
have
hated
rosalie
had
she
caught
her
in
a
single
moment
of
unguardedness
revealing
a
feeling
more
tender
than
friendly
interest
for
him
sophisticated
and
the
gay
careless
miss
bonner
read
her
pages
quickly
she
skimmed
them
but
she
saw
a
great
deal
between
the
lines
if
her
mother
had
been
equally
discerning
that
very
estimable
lady
might
have
found
herself
immensely
relieved
along
certain
lines
bonner
was
having
a
hard
time
of
it
these
days
it
was
worse
than
misery
to
stay
indoors
and
it
was
utterly
out
of
the
question
for
him
to
venture
out
his
leg
was
healing
with
disgusting
rashness
but
his
heart
was
going
into
an
illness
that
was
to
scoff
at
the
cures
of
man
and
if
his
parting
with
his
mother
and
the
young
woman
savoured
of
relief
he
must
he
forgiven
a
sore
breast
is
no
respecter
of
persons
they
were
returning
to
the
hub
by
the
early
morning
train
from
boggs
city
and
it
was
understood
that
rosalie
was
to
come
to
them
in
june
let
it
be
said
in
good
truth
that
both
bonner
and
her
daughter
were
delighted
to
have
her
promise
if
they
felt
any
uneasiness
as
to
the
possibility
of
unwholesome
revelations
in
connection
with
her
birth
they
purposely
blindfolded
themselves
and
indulged
in
the
game
of
consequences
bonner
was
waiting
in
the
automobile
having
said
to
wicker
i
keep
close
watch
on
him
bonner
promised
anderson
and
telegraph
you
if
his
condition
changes
a
mite
i
ast
smith
to
tell
me
the
real
truth
him
an
the
real
truth
what
do
you
mean
she
cried
in
fresh
alarm
do
worry
he
improvin
fine
says
he
told
me
he
be
out
o
danger
when
he
got
back
to
boston
his
heart
worryin
a
little

the
grin
derisive
i
like
your
ma
said
anderson
to
wicker
later
in
the
evening
a
perfect
lady
doggone
it
a
relief
to
see
a
rich
woman
that
knows
how
to
be
a
lady
she
ai
a
bit
stuck
up
an
yet
she
a
aristocrat
did
i
ever
tell
you
about
what
happened
to
judge
courtwright
wife
no
well
it
was
a
long
time
ago
right
here
in
tinkletown
the
judge
concluded
this
would
be
a
good
place
fer
a
summer
home
so
him
an
her
put
up
a
grand
residence
down
there
on
the
river
bluff
it
was
the
only
summer
place
on
this
side
of
the
river
well
of
course
courtwright
had
to
turn
in
an
be
the
leader
of
the
women
in
this
place
she
lorded
it
over
an
she
give
to
understand
that
she
was
a
queen

somethin
like
that
an
they
was
nothin
but
peasants
an
the
derned
fool

to
do
it

as
though
her
was
a
over
in
england
an
she
had
a
right
to
be
swell
well
she
ruled
the
roost
fer
two
summers
nobody
could
get
near
her
without
a
special
dispensation
from
the
almighty
she
would
look
at
anybody
with
her
eyes
her
chin
was
so
high
in
the
air
that
she
had
to
look
through
her
nose
her
husband
was
as
old
as
methoosalum
that
is
he
was
as
old
as
methoosalum
was
when
he
was
a
boy
so
to
speak
an
she
had
him
skeered
of
his
life
but
i
fixed
her
at
the
end
of
the
second
summer
she
was
ready
to
git
up
an
git
duke
er
no
duke
lem
me

a
tip
wick

you
want
to
fetch
a
queen

your
level

laughin
at
her
well
sir
the
judge
wife
used
to
turn
up
her
nose
at
me
until
i
got
to
feelin
too
small
to
be
seen
my
pride
was
wallerin
in
the
dust
finally
i
thought
of
a
scheme
to
fix
her
every
time
i
saw
her
i
grin
at
her
not
sayin
a
word
mind
you
but
jest
lookin
at
her
as
if
she
struck
me
as
bein
funny
well
sir
i
kept
it
up
good
an
strong
first
thing
i
knowed
she
was
beginnin
to
look
as
though
a
bee
had
stung
her
an
she
could
find
the
place
i
ketch
her
stealin
sly
glances
at
me
an
she
allus
found
me
with
a
grin
on
my
face
a
good
healthy
grin
too
there
was
anything
to
laugh
at
mind
you
but
she
did
know
that
she
got
to
fixin
her
back
hair
and
lookin
worried
about
her
clothes
she
wipe
her
face
to
see
if
the
powder
was
on
straight
all
the
time
wonderin
what
in
thunder
i
was
laughin
at
if
she
passed
in
her
kerridge
she
peep
back
to
see
if
i
was
laughin
and
i
allus
was
i
never
failed
all
this
time
i
was
sayin
a
grinnin
as
though
she
tickled
me
half
to
death
gradually
i
begin
to
be
scientific
about
it
i
got
so
that
when
she
caught
me
laughin
i
try
my
best
to
hide
the
grin
course
that
made
it
all
the
worse
she
fidgeted
squirmed
an
got
red
in
the
face
till
it
looked
like
she
was
pickled
doggone
ef
she
did
begin
to
neglect
her
business
as
a
she
did
have
time
to
lord
it
over
her
peasants
she
was
too
blame
busy
wonderin
what
i
was
laughin
at
illustration
it
was
a
wise
discreet
old
oak
she
begin
to
look
peaked
an
thin
she
looked
like
she
was
ghosts
all
the
time
that
blamed
grin
of
mine
pursued
her
every
minute
course
she
could
kick
about
it
that
would
do
at
all
she
jest
had
to
bear
it
without
grinnin
there
was
anything
to
say
finally
she
got
to
stayin
away
from
the
meetin
an
almost
quit
through
the
town
everybody
noticed
the
change
in
her
people
said
she
was
goin
crazy
about
her
hack
hair
she
lost
thirty
pounds
before
august
and
when
september
come
the
judge
had
to
take
her
to
a
rest
cure
they
never
come
back
to
tinkletown
an
the
judge
had
to
sell
the
place
fer
half
what
it
cost
him
fer
two
years
she
almost
went
into
hysterics
when
anybody
laughed
but
it
done
her
good
it
changed
her
idees
she
got
over
her
high
an
mighty
ways
they
say
an
i
hear
one
of
the
nicest
sweetest
old
ladies
in
boggs
city
nowadays
but
blootch
peabody
says
that
to
this
day
she
looks
flustered
when
anybody
notices
her
back
hair
the
lord
knows
i
laughin
at
her
hair
i
do
see
why
she
thought
so
do
you
bonner
laughed
long
and
heartily
over
the
experiment
but
rosalie
vigorously
expressed
her
disapproval
of
the
marshal
methods
it
the
only
real
mean
thing
i
ever
heard
of
you
doing
daddy
crow
she
cried
it
was
cruel
course
you
take
her
part
bein
a
woman
said
he
serenely
crow
did
too
when
i
told
her
about
it
twenty
years
ago
women
got
much
sense
of
humour
have
they
wick
he
was
calling
him
wick
nowadays
and
the
young
man
enjoyed
the
familiarity
the
days
came
when
bonner
could
walk
about
with
his
cane
and
he
was
not
slow
to
avail
himself
of
the
privilege
this
afforded
it
meant
enjoyable
strolls
with
rosalie
and
it
meant
the
elevation
of
his
spirits
to
such
heights
that
the
skies
formed
no
bounds
for
them
the
town
was
not
slow
to
draw
conclusions
every
one
said
it
would
be
a
match
it
was
certain
that
the
interesting
boston
man
had
acquired
a
clear
field
tinkletown
beaux
gave
up
in
despair
and
dropped
out
of
the
contest
with
the
hope
that
complete
recovery
from
his
injuries
might
not
only
banish
bonner
from
the
village
but
also
from
the
thoughts
of
rosalie
gray
most
of
the
young
men
took
their
medicine
philosophically
they
had
known
from
the
first
that
their
chances
were
small
blootch
peabody
and
ed
higgins
because
of
the
personal
rivalry
between
themselves
hoped
on
and
on
and
grew
more
bitter
between
themselves
instead
of
toward
bonner
illustration
beg
your
pardon
he
said
humbly
anderson
crow
and
eva
were
delighted
and
the
misses
crow
after
futile
efforts
to
interest
the
young
man
in
their
own
wares
fell
in
with
the
old
folks
and
exuberantly
whispered
to
the
world
that
it
would
be
perfectly
glorious
roscoe
was
not
so
charitable
he
was
soundly
disgusted
with
the
thought
of
losing
his
friend
bonner
in
the
hated
bonds
of
matrimony
from
his
juvenile
point
of
view
it
was
a
fate
that
a
good
fellow
like
bonner
did
not
deserve
even
rosalie
was
not
good
enough
for
him
so
he
told
bud
long
but
bud
who
had
worshipped
rosalie
with
a
hopeless
devotion
through
most
of
his
short
life
took
strong
though
sheepish
exceptions
to
the
remark
it
seemed
quite
settled
in
the
minds
of
every
one
but
bonner
and
rosalie
themselves
they
went
along
evenly
happily
perhaps
dreamily
letting
the
present
and
the
future
take
care
of
themselves
as
best
they
could
making
mountains
of
the
past
mountains
so
high
and
sheer
that
they
could
not
be
surmounted
in
retreat
bonner
was
helplessly
in
love
so
much
so
indeed
that
in
the
face
of
it
he
lost
the
courage
that
had
carried
him
through
trivial
affairs
of
the
past
and
left
him
floundering
vaguely
in
seas
that
looked
old
and
yet
were
new
hourly
he
sought
for
the
first
sign
of
love
in
her
eyes
for
the
first
touch
of
sentiment
but
if
there
was
a
point
of
weakness
in
her
defence
it
was
not
revealed
to
the
hungry
perception
of
the
conqueror
and
so
they
drifted
on
through
the
february
chill
that
seemed
warm
to
them
through
the
light
hours
and
the
dark
ones
quickly
and
surely
to
the
day
which
was
to
call
him
cured
of
one
ill
and
yet
sorely
afflicted
by
another
through
it
all
he
was
saying
to
himself
that
it
did
not
matter
what
her
birth
may
have
been
so
long
as
she
lived
at
this
hour
in
his
life
and
yet
a
still
cool
voice
was
whispering
procrastination
with
persistency
through
every
avenue
of
his
brain
wait
said
the
cool
voice
of
prejudice
his
heart
did
not
hear
but
his
brain
did
one
look
of
submission
from
her
tender
eyes
and
his
brain
would
have
turned
deaf
to
the
small
cool
voice
but
her
eyes
stood
their
ground
and
the
voice
survived
the
day
was
fast
approaching
when
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
leave
the
home
of
crow
he
could
no
longer
encroach
upon
the
hospitality
and
good
nature
of
the
marshal
especially
as
he
had
declined
the
proffered
appointment
to
become
deputy
town
marshal
together
they
had
discussed
every
possible
side
to
the
abduction
mystery
and
had
laid
the
groundwork
for
a
systematic
attempt
at
a
solution
there
was
nothing
more
for
them
to
do
true
to
his
promise
bonner
had
put
the
case
in
the
hands
of
one
of
the
greatest
detectives
in
the
land
together
with
every
known
point
in
the
girl
history
tinkletown
was
not
to
provide
the
solution
although
it
contained
the
mystery
on
that
point
there
could
be
no
doubt
so
bonner
was
reluctantly
compelled
to
admit
to
himself
that
he
had
no
plausible
excuse
for
staying
on
the
great
detective
from
new
york
had
come
to
town
gathered
all
of
the
facts
under
cover
of
strictest
secrecy
run
down
every
possible
shadow
of
a
clew
in
boggs
city
and
had
returned
to
the
metropolis
there
to
begin
the
search
years
back
four
weeks
bonner
was
saying
to
her
reflectively
as
they
came
homeward
from
their
last
visit
to
the
abandoned
mill
on
turnip
creek
it
was
a
bright
warm
february
morning
suggestive
of
spring
and
fraught
with
the
fragrance
of
something
far
sweeter
four
weeks
of
idleness
and
joy
to
me
almost
a
lifetime
in
the
waste
of
years
does
it
seem
long
to
you
miss
gray
oh
i
remember
i
am
to
call
you
rosalie
it
seems
that
i
have
known
you
always
instead
of
for
four
weeks
she
said
gently
they
have
been
happy
weeks
have
they
my
our
only
fear
is
that
you
have
been
comfortable
in
our
poor
little
home
not
what
you
are
accustomed
home
is
what
the
home
folks
make
it
he
said
striving
to
quote
a
vague
old
saying
he
was
dimly
conscious
of
a
subdued
smile
on
her
part
and
he
felt
the
fool
at
any
rate
i
was
more
than
comfortable
i
was
happy
never
so
happy
all
my
life
shall
be
built
about
this
single
month
my
past
ends
with
it
my
future
begins
you
rosalie
he
went
on
swiftly
his
eyes
gleaming
with
the
love
that
would
not
be
denied
are
the
spirit
of
life
as
i
shall
know
it
from
this
day
forth
it
is
you
who
have
made
tinkletown
a
kingdom
one
of
its
homes
a
palace
do
turn
your
face
away
rosalie
but
she
turned
her
face
toward
him
and
her
dark
eyes
did
not
flinch
as
they
met
his
out
there
in
the
bleak
old
wood
do
please
do
wicker
she
said
softly
firmly
her
hand
touched
his
arm
for
an
instant
you
will
understand
wo
you
please
do
there
was
a
world
of
meaning
in
it
his
heart
turned
cold
as
ice
the
blood
left
his
face
he
understood
she
did
not
love
him
yes
he
said
his
voice
dead
and
hoarse
i
think
i
understand
rosalie
i
have
taken
too
much
for
granted
fool
that
i
am
bah
the
egotism
of
a
fool
you
must
not
speak
like
that
she
said
her
face
contracted
by
pain
and
pity
you
are
the
most
wonderful
man
i
ever
known
the
best
and
the
truest
but
and
she
paused
with
a
wan
drear
smile
on
her
lips
i
understand
he
interrupted
do
say
it
i
want
to
think
that
some
day
you
will
feel
like
saying
something
else
and
i
want
to
hope
rosalie
that
it
wo
always
be
like
this
let
us
talk
about
something
else
but
neither
cared
to
speak
for
what
seemed
an
hour
they
were
in
sight
of
home
before
the
stony
silence
was
broken
i
may
come
over
from
bonner
place
to
see
you
he
asked
at
last
he
was
to
cross
the
river
the
next
day
for
a
stay
of
a
week
or
two
at
his
uncle
place
yes
often
wicker
i
shall
want
to
see
you
every
day
yes
every
day
i
sure
of
it
she
said
wistfully
a
hungry
look
in
her
eyes
that
he
did
not
see
for
he
was
staring
straight
ahead
had
he
seen
that
look
or
caught
the
true
tone
in
her
voice
the
world
might
not
have
looked
so
dark
to
him
when
he
did
look
at
her
again
her
face
was
calm
almost
to
sereneness
and
you
will
come
to
boston
in
june
just
the
same
if
your
sister
and
and
your
mother
still
want
me
to
come
illustration
think
i
understand
rosalie
she
was
thinking
of
herself
the
nameless
one
in
the
house
of
his
people
she
was
thinking
of
the
doubts
the
speculations
even
the
fears
that
would
form
the
background
of
her
welcome
in
that
proud
house
no
longer
was
rosalie
gray
regarding
herself
as
the
happy
careless
of
anderson
crow
she
was
seeing
herself
only
as
the
castaway
the
unwanted
and
the
world
was
growing
bitter
for
her
but
bonner
was
blind
to
all
this
he
could
not
should
not
know
you
know
they
want
you
to
come
why
do
you
say
that
he
asked
quickly
a
strange
dim
perspective
rising
before
him
for
an
instant
only
to
fade
away
before
it
could
be
analysed
one
always
says
that
she
replied
with
a
smile
it
is
the
penalty
of
being
invited
your
sister
has
written
the
dearest
letter
to
me
and
i
have
answered
it
we
love
one
another
she
and
i
rosalie
i
am
going
to
write
to
you
said
he
suddenly
you
will
answer
yes
she
told
him
simply
his
heart
quickened
but
faltered
and
was
lost
i
had
a
long
letter
from
elsie
banks
she
went
on
with
an
indifference
that
chilled
oh
he
said
she
is
your
friend
who
was
or
is
to
marry
tom
reddon
i
believe
i
knew
him
at
harvard
tell
me
are
they
married
no
it
was
not
to
take
place
until
march
but
now
she
writes
that
her
mother
is
ill
and
must
go
to
california
for
several
months
reddon
wants
to
be
married
at
once
or
before
they
go
west
at
least
but
she
says
she
can
not
consent
while
her
mother
requires
so
much
of
her
i
do
know
how
it
will
end
but
i
presume
they
will
be
married
and
all
go
to
california
that
seems
the
simple
and
just
way
does
it
any
way
seems
just
i
say
he
said
they
love
one
another
so
what
the
odds
do
you
know
reddon
well
i
have
seen
him
many
times
she
replied
with
apparent
evasiveness
he
is
a
but
here
he
stopped
as
if
paralysis
had
seized
him
suddenly
the
truth
shot
into
his
brain
like
a
deadly
bolt
everything
was
as
plain
as
day
to
him
now
she
stooped
to
pick
up
a
slim
broken
reed
that
crossed
her
path
and
her
face
was
averted
god
was
the
cry
that
almost
escaped
his
lips
she
loves
reddon
and
he
is
going
to
marry
her
best
friend
cold
perspiration
started
from
every
pore
in
his
body
he
had
met
the
doom
of
love
the
end
of

he
has
always
loved
her
said
rosalie
so
calmly
that
he
was
shocked
by
her
courage
i
hope
she
will
not
ask
him
to
wait
rosalie
never
understood
why
bonner
looked
at
her
in
amazement

said
by

chapter
xxviii
the
blind
man
eyes
bonner
went
away
without
another
word
of
love
to
her
he
saw
the
futility
of
hoping
and
he
was
noble
enough
to
respect
her
plea
for
silence
on
the
subject
that
seemed
distasteful
to
her
he
went
as
one
conquered
and
subdued
he
went
with
the
iron
in
his
heart
for
the
first
time
deeply
imbedded
and
racking
bonner
came
twice
from
the
place
across
the
river
anderson
observed
that
he
looked
peaked
and
rosalie
mistook
the
hungry
wan
look
in
his
face
for
the
emaciation
natural
to
confinement
indoors
he
was
whiter
than
was
his
wont
and
there
was
a
dogged
stubborn
look
growing
about
his
eyes
and
mouth
that
would
have
been
understood
by
the
sophisticated
it
was
the
first
indication
of
the
battle
his
love
was
to
wage
in
days
to
come
he
saw
no
sign
of
weakening
in
rosalie
she
would
not
let
him
look
into
her
brave
little
heart
and
so
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
field
and
fled
to
boston
half
beaten
but
unconsciously
collecting
his
forces
for
the
strife
of
another
day
he
did
not
know
it
then
nor
did
she
but
his
love
was
not
vanquished
it
had
met
its
first
rebuff
that
was
all
tinkletown
was
sorry
to
see
him
depart
but
it
thrived
on
his
promise
to
return
every
one
winked
slyly
behind
his
back
for
of
course
tinkletown
understood
it
all
he
would
come
back
often
and
then
not
at
all
for
the
magnet
would
go
away
with
him
in
the
end
the
busybodies
but
garrulous
did
not
have
to
rehearse
the
story
to
its
end
it
would
have
been
superfluous
be
it
said
here
however
that
rosalie
was
not
long
in
settling
many
of
the
speculators
straight
in
their
minds
it
seemed
improbable
that
it
should
not
be
as
they
had
thought
and
hoped
the
news
soon
reached
blootch
peabody
and
ed
higgins
and
both
eager
to
revive
a
blighted
hope
in
high
spirits
called
to
see
rosalie
on
the
same
night
it
is
on
record
that
neither
of
them
uttered
two
dozen
words
between
eight
and
ten
so
bitterly
was
the
presence
of
the
other
resented
march
came
and
with
it
to
the
intense
amazement
of
anderson
crow
the
thousand
dollars
a
few
weeks
late
on
a
certain
day
the
old
marshal
took
rosalie
to
boggs
city
and
the
guardianship
proceedings
were
legally
closed
listlessly
she
accepted
half
of
the
money
he
had
saved
having
refused
to
take
all
of
it
she
was
now
her
own
mistress
much
to
her
regret
if
not
to
his
i
may
go
on
living
with
you
daddy
crow
may
i
not
she
asked
wistfully
as
they
drove
home
through
the
march
blizzard
this
mean
that
i
can
not
be
your
own
little
girl
after
does
it
do
talk
like
that
rosalie
gray
er
i
put
you
to
bed
a
speck
o
supper
growled
he
in
his
most
threatening
tones
but
the
tears
were
rolling
down
his
cheeks
at
the
time
do
you
know
daddy
i
honestly
hope
that
the
big
city
detective
find
out
who
i
am
she
said
after
a
long
period
of
reflection
cause
why
because
if
he
does
you
wo
have
any
excuse
for
turning
me
out
i
not
only
send
you
to
bed
but
i
give
you
a
tarnation
good
lickin
besides
if
you
talk
like
but
i
you
have
no
right
said
she
so
brightly
that
he
cracked
his
whip
over
the
horse
back
and
blew
his
nose
twice
for
full
measure
of
gratitude
well
i
ai
heerd
anything
from
that
fly
detective
lately
an
beginnin
to
think
he
ai
sech
a
long
sight
i
am
said
he
proudly
he
is
half
as
good
she
cried
i
mean
as
a
detective
he
supplemented
apologetically
so
do
i
she
agreed
earnestly
but
it
was
lost
on
him
there
was
a
letter
at
home
for
her
from
edith
bonner
it
brought
the
news
that
wicker
was
going
south
to
recuperate
his
system
had
gone
off
since
the
accident
and
the
march
winds
were
driving
him
away
temporarily
rosalie
heart
ached
that
night
and
there
was
a
still
cold
dread
in
its
depths
that
drove
sleep
away
he
had
not
written
to
her
and
she
had
begun
to
fear
that
their
month
had
been
a
trifle
to
him
after
all
now
she
was
troubled
and
grieved
that
she
should
have
entertained
the
fear
edith
went
on
to
say
that
her
brother
had
seen
the
new
york
detective
who
was
still
hopelessly
in
the
dark
but
struggling
on
in
the
belief
that
chance
would
open
the
way
for
him
rosalie
strive
as
she
would
to
prevent
it
grew
pale
and
the
roundness
left
her
cheek
as
the
weeks
went
by
her
every
thought
was
with
the
man
who
had
gone
to
the
southland
she
loved
him
as
she
loved
life
but
she
could
not
confess
to
him
then
or
thereafter
unless
providence
made
clear
the
purity
of
her
birth
to
her
and
to
all
the
world
when
finally
there
came
to
her
a
long
friendly
even
dignified
letter
from
the
far
south
the
roses
began
to
struggle
back
to
her
cheeks
and
the
warmth
to
her
heart
her
response
brought
a
prompt
answer
from
him
and
the
roses
grew
faster
than
the
spring
itself
friendship
sweet
and
loyal
marked
every
word
that
passed
between
them
but
there
was
a
dear
world
in
each
epistle
for
her
at
least
a
world
of
comfort
and
hope
she
was
praying
hungering
longing
for
june
to
come
sweet
june
and
its
tender
touch
june
with
its
and
sun
clouds
now
she
was
forgetting
the
wish
which
had
been
expressed
to
anderson
crow
on
the
drive
home
from
boggs
city
in
its
place
grew
the
fierce
hope
that
the
once
despised
detective
might
clear
away
the
mystery
and
give
her
the
right
to
stand
among
others
without
shame
and
despair
hear
from
wick
purty
do
you
rosalie
asked
anderson
wickedly
one
night
while
blootch
was
there
the
suitor
moved
uneasily
and
rosalie
shot
a
reproachful
glance
at
anderson
a
glance
full
of
mischief
as
well
he
writes
occasionally
daddy
i
did
know
you
corresponded
said
blootch
i
did
not
say
regularly
blucher
he
writes
sweet
things
to
beat
the
band

blootch
with
a
disdain
he
did
not
feel
what
a
good
guesser
you
are
she
cried
tormentingly
well
i
guess
i
be
goin
exploded
blootch
wrathfully
gittin
late
he
wo
sleep
much
said
anderson
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
as
the
gate
slammed
viciously
behind
the
caller
say
rosalie
there

been
fidgetin
me
fer
quite
a
while
i
blurt
it
right
out
an
have
it
over
with
air
you
in
love
with
wick
bonner
she
started
and
for
an
instant
looked
at
him
with
wide
open
eyes
then
they
faltered
and
fell
her
breath
came
in
a
frightened
surprised
gasp
and
her
cheeks
grew
warm
when
she
looked
up
again
her
eyes
were
soft
and
pleading
and
her
lips
trembled
ever
so
slightly
yes
daddy
crow
i
love
him
she
almost
whispered
an
him
how
about
him
i
ca
answer
that
daddy
he
has
not
told
me
well
he
ought
to
doggone
him
i
could
not
permit
him
to
do
so
if
he
tried
what
you
would
permit
what
in
tarnation
do
you
mean
you
forget
daddy
i
have
no
right
to
his
love
it
would
be
wrong
all
wrong
daddy
she
cried
impulsively
kissing
him
and
dashing
away
before
he
could
check
her
but
not
before
he
caught
the
sound
of
a
half
sob
for
a
long
time
he
sat
and
stared
at
the
fire
in
the
grate
then
he
slapped
his
knee
vigorously
squared
his
shoulders
and
set
his
jaw
like
a
vise
arising
he
stalked
upstairs
and
tapped
on
her
door
she
opened
it
an
inch
or
two
and
peered
forth
at
him
a
pathetic
figure
in
white
do
you
worry
rosalie
he
gulped
it
will
be
all
right
and
hunky
dory
i
just
took
a
solemn
oath
down
stairs
an
oath
daddy
yes
sir
i
swore
by
all
that
good
and
holy
i
find
out
who
your
parents
are
ef
it
took
till
doomsday
you
shall
be
set
right
in
the
eyes
of
everybody
now
if
i
was
you
i
go
right
to
sleep
there
nothin
to
worry
about
i
got
another
clew
she
smiled
lovingly
as
he
ambled
away
poor
old
anderson
confidence
in
himself
was
only
exceeded
by
his
great
love
for
her
at
last
june
smiled
upon
rosalie
and
she
was
off
for
boston
her
gowns
were
from
albany
and
her
happiness
from
heaven
according
to
a
reverential
tinkletown
impression
for
two
weeks
after
her
departure
anderson
crow
talked
himself
hoarse
into
willing
ears
always
extolling
the
beauty
of
his
erstwhile
ward
as
she
appeared
before
the
family
circle
in
each
and
every
one
of
those
wonderful
gowns
this
humble
narrative
has
not
to
do
with
the
glories
and
foibles
of
boston
social
life
it
has
to
deal
with
the
adventures
of
anderson
crow
and
rosalie
gray
in
so
far
as
they
pertain
to
a
place
called
tinkletown
the
joys
and
pleasures
that
rosalie
experienced
during
that
month
of
june
were
not
unusual
in
character
the
loneliness
of
anderson
crow
was
not
a
novelty
if
one
stops
to
consider
how
the
world
revolves
for
every
one
else
suffice
to
say
that
the
bonners
and
exerted
themselves
to
make
the
month
an
unforgetable
one
to
the
girl
and
they
succeeded
the
usual
gaiety
the
same
old
whirl
of
experiences
came
to
her
that
come
to
any
other
mortal
who
is
being
entertained
fêted
and
admired
she
was
a
success
a
pleasure
in
every
way
not
only
to
her
hosts
but
to
herself
if
there
was
a
cloud
hanging
over
her
head
through
all
these
days
and
nights
the
world
was
none
the
wiser
the
silver
lining
was
always
visible
once
while
she
was
driving
with
the
bonners
she
saw
a
man
whom
she
knew
but
did
not
expect
to
ever
look
upon
again
she
could
not
be
mistaken
in
him
it
was
sam
welch
chief
of
the
kidnapers
he
was
gazing
at
her
from
a
crowded
street
corner
but
disappeared
completely
before
bonner
could
set
the
police
on
his
trail
commencement
day
at
cambridge
brought
back
hundreds
of
the
old
men
the
men
famous
in
every
branch
of
study
and
athletics
among
them
was
handsome
tom
reddon
he
came
to
see
her
at
the
bonner
home
elsie
banks
was
to
return
in
september
from
honolulu
and
they
were
to
be
married
in
the
fall
wicker
bonner
eagerly
looked
for
the
confusion
of
love
in
her
eyes
but
none
appeared
that
night
she
told
him
in
reply
to
an
impulsive
demand
that
she
did
not
care
for
reddon
that
she
never
had
known
the
slightest
feeling
of
tenderness
for
him
have
you
ever
been
in
love
rosalie
he
asked
ruthlessly
yes
she
said
after
a
moment
looking
him
bravely
in
the
eyes
and
could
you
never
learn
to
love
any
one
else
i
think
not
wicker
she
said
ever
so
softly
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
humbly
his
face
white
and
his
lips
drawn
i
should
not
have
asked
and
so
he
remained
the
blind
man
with
the
light
shining
full
into
his
eyes
chapter
xxix
the
mysterious
questioner
july
brought
rosalie
visit
to
an
end
and
once
more
tinkletown
basked
in
her
smiles
and
yet
wondered
why
they
were
so
sad
and
wistful
she
and
bonner
were
much
nearer
far
dearer
to
one
another
than
ever
and
yet
not
one
effort
had
been
made
to
bridge
the
chasm
of
silence
concerning
the
thing
that
lay
uppermost
in
their
minds
she
only
knew
that
anderson
crow
had
not
run
down
his
clew
nor
had
the
new
york
sleuth
reported
for
weeks
undoubtedly
the
latter
had
given
up
the
search
for
the
last
heard
of
him
was
when
he
left
for
europe
with
his
wife
for
a
pleasure
trip
of
unknown
duration
it
looked
so
dark
and
hopeless
to
her
all
of
it
had
bonner
pressed
his
demands
upon
her
at
the
end
of
the
visit
in
boston
it
is
possible
more
than
possible
that
she
would
have
faltered
in
her
resolution
after
all
why
should
she
deprive
herself
of
happiness
if
it
was
held
out
to
her
with
the
promise
that
it
should
never
end
the
summer
turned
steaming
hot
in
the
lowlands
about
tinkletown
but
in
the
great
hills
across
the
river
the
air
was
cool
bright
and
invigorating
people
began
to
hurry
to
their
country
homes
from
the
distant
cities
before
the
month
was
old
a
score
or
more
of
beautiful
places
were
opened
and
filled
with
the
sons
and
daughters
of
the
rich
lazily
they
drifted
and
drove
and
walked
through
the
wonderful
hills
famed
throughout
the
world
and
lazily
they
wondered
why
the
rest
of
the
world
lived
in
the
hills
now
were
the
randalls
the
farnsworths
the
brackens
the
brewsters
the
van
wagenens
the
rolfes
and
a
host
of
others
tinkletown
saw
them
occasionally
as
they
came
jaunting
by
in
their
traps
and
brakes
and
automobiles
but
it
is
extremely
doubtful
if
they
saw
tinkletown
in
passing
anderson
crow
swelled
and
blossomed
in
the
radiance
of
his
own
importance
in
his
old
age
he
was
becoming
fastidious
only
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
back
yard
did
he
go
without
the
black
alpaca
coat
he
was
beginning
to
despise
the
other
days
when
he
had
gone
coatless
from
dawn
till
dark
on
the
street
or
off
his
badges
were
pinned
neatly
to
his
lapel
and
not
to
his
suspenders
as
in
the
days
of
yore
his
dignity
was
the
same
but
the
old
sense
of
irritation
was
very
much
modified
in
these
new
days
he
was
considerate
and
patronising
was
he
not
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
in
town
with
his
six
thousand
dollars
laid
by
was
he
not
its
most
honoured
citizen
not
excepting
the
mayor
and
selectmen
was
he
not
above
all
a
close
friend
of
the
bonners
the
bonners
were
to
spend
august
in
the
congressman
home
across
the
big
river
this
fact
alone
was
enough
to
stir
the
crow
establishment
to
its
most
infinitesimal
roots
rosalie
was
to
be
one
of
the
guests
at
the
house
party
but
her
were
not
the
kind
to
be
envious
they
revelled
with
her
in
the
preparations
for
that
new
season
of
delight
with
the
coming
of
the
bonners
anderson
once
more
revived
his
resolution
to
unravel
the
mystery
attending
rosalie
birth
for
some
months
this
ambition
had
lain
dormant
but
now
with
the
approach
of
the
man
she
loved
the
old
marshal
devotion
took
fire
and
he
swore
daily
that
the
mystery
should
be
cleared
whether
it
wanted
to
be
or
not
he
put
poor
old
alf
reesling
through
the
sweat
box
time
and
again
and
worthless
tom
folly
had
many
an
unhappy
night
wondering
why
the
marshal
was
shadowing
him
so
persistently
alf
demanded
anderson
during
one
of
the
sessions
where
were
you
on
the
night
of
february
do
hesitate
speak
up
where
were
you
aha
you
cai
answer
that
looks
suspicious

said
alf
bravely
blinking
his
blear
eyes
i
was
in
tinkletown
what
were
you

that
night
i
was
sleepin
at
what
time
keerful
now

turn

past

jest
the
time
i
was
asleep

said
anderson
i
do
expect

to
the
first
day
that
bonner
drove
over
in
the
automobile
to
transplant
rosalie
in
the
place
across
the
river
found
anderson
full
of
a
new
and
startling
sensation
he
stealthily
drew
the
big
sunburnt
young
man
into
the
stable
far
from
the
house
somehow
in
spite
of
his
smiles
bonner
was
looking
older
and
more
serious
there
was
a
set
determined
expression
about
his
mouth
and
eyes
that
struck
anderson
as
new
say
wick
began
the
marshal
mysteriously
i
up
a
stump
what
another
no
jest
the
same
one
i
almost
got
track
of
somethin
not
two
hours
ago
i
met
a
man
out
yander
near
the
that
i
sure
i
seen
aroun
here
about
the
time
rosalie
was
left
on
the
porch
an
the
funny
part
of
it
was
he
stopped
me
an
ast
me
about
her
doggone
i
wish
i
ast
him
his
name
you
do
mean
it
cried
bonner
all
interest
asked
about
her
was
he
a
stranger
i
think
he
was
leastwise
he
said
he
had
been
aroun
here
fer
twenty
year
it
was
this
way
i
was
over
to
lem
to
ask
if
he

said
he

missed
any
an
ast
me
if
any
hogs
had
been
found
i
tole
him
no
not
that
i
knowed
of
but
i
jest
thought
i
ask
i
thought
mebby
he
had
some
stole
you
never
tell
you
know
an
it
pays
to
be
attendin
to
business
all
the
time
well
i
was
drivin
back
slow
when
up
rode
a
feller
on
horseback
he
was
a
man
fifty
year
old
i
reckon
an
was
dressed
in
all
them
ridin
togs
this
crow
my
old
friend
the
detective
said
he
sir
said
i
guess
you
do
remember
me
says
he
i
told
him
i
did
but
i
lied
it
would
do
fer
him
to
think
i
did
know
him
an
me
a
detective
do
we
chatted
about
the
weather
an
the
crops
him
ridin
longside
the
buckboard
doggone
his
face
was
familiar
but
i
could
place
it
finally
he
leaned
over
an
said
you
still
got
the
little
girl
that
was
left
on
your
porch
you
bet
i
jumped
when
he
said
that
says
i
she
ai
a
little
girl
now
she
growed
up
she
purty
he
ast
says
i
as
a
speckled
pup
like
to
see
her
he
said
hear
she
was
a
beautiful
baby
i
hope
she
is
very
very
happy
that
to
you
says
i
am
very
much
interested
in
her
crow
he
answered
child
i
have
had
her
in
mind
for
a
long
time
he
went
on
very
solemn
i
begin
to
suspect
right
away
that
he
had
a
lot
to
do
with
her
affairs
somehow
i
could
help
thinkin
i
seen
him
in
tinkletown
about
the
time
she
was
dropped
left
i
mean
have
given
her
a
good
eddication
i
hope
said
he
got
the
best
in
town
said
i
thousand
dollars
came
all
right
every
year
february
should
like
to
see
her
sometime
if
i
may
without
her
knowin
it
mr
crow
why
that
way
sir
demanded
i
would
probably
annoy
her
if
she
thought
i
was
her
as
an
object
of
curiosity
said
he
her
fer
me
he
went
gittin
ready
to
whip
up
she
has
an
unknown
friend
who
would
give
anything
he
has
to
help
her
goshed
if
he
did
put
the
gad
to
his
horse
an
gallop
off
i
could
say
another
word
i
was
goin
to
ask
him
a
lot
of
questions
too
ca
you
remember
where
and
under
what
circumstances
you
saw
him
before
cried
bonner
very
much
excited
i
goin
to
try
to
think
it
up
he
was
a
feller
an
he
had
a
heavy
black
band
aroun
one
of
his
coat
sleeves
wick
i
bet
he
the
man
we
want
i
made
up
my
mind
he
her
father
bonner
impatiently
wormed
all
the
information
possible
out
of
the
marshal
especially
as
to
the
stranger
looks
voice
the
direction
taken
when
they
parted
company
and
then
dismally
concluded
that
an
excellent
opportunity
had
been
hopelessly
lost
anderson
said
in
that
the
stranger
had
told
him
he
was
leavin
at
once
fer
new
york
and
then
going
to
europe
his
mother
had
died
recently
i
try
to
head
him
off
at
boggs
city
said
bonner
and
half
an
hour
later
he
was
off
at
full
speed
in
the
big
machine
for
the
county
seat
a
roundabout
way
to
bonner
place
the
new
york
train
had
gone
but
no
one
had
seen
a
man
answering
the
description
of
anderson
interviewer
i
sorry
rosalie
said
bonner
some
time
later
he
was
taking
her
for
a
spin
in
the
automobile
it
was
a
forlorn
hope
and
it
is
also
quite
probable
that
crow
impressions
are
wrong
the
man
may
have
absolutely
no
connection
with
the
matter
i
admit
it
looks
interesting
his
manner
and
his
questions
and
there
is
a
chance
that
he
knows
the
true
story
in
any
event
he
did
not
go
to
new
york
and
he
ca
get
another
train
until
i
pick
up
crow
in
the
morning
and
we
run
up
here
to
have
a
look
at
him
if
he
appears
i
think
it
is
a
wild
goose
chase
wicker
rosalie
said
despairingly
daddy
crow
has
done
such
things
before
but
this
seems
different
the
man
actions
were
curious
he
must
have
had
some
reason
for
being
interested
in
you
i
am
absolutely
wild
with
eagerness
to
solve
this
mystery
rosalie
it
means
life
to
me
oh
if
you
only
could
do
it
she
cried
so
fervently
that
his
heart
leaped
with
pity
for
her
i
love
you
rosalie
i
would
give
my
whole
life
to
make
you
happy
listen
dearest
do
turn
away
from
me
are
you
afraid
of
me
he
was
almost
wailing
it
into
her
ear
i
i
was
only
thinking
of
the
danger
wicker
you
are
not
watching
the
road
she
said
flushing
a
deep
red
he
laughed
gaily
for
the
first
time
in
months
it
is
a
wide
road
and
clear
he
said
jubilantly
we
are
alone
and
we
are
merely
drifting
the
machine
is
alive
with
happiness
rosalie
rosalie
i
could
shout
for
joy
you
love
me
you
will
be
my
wife
she
was
white
and
silent
and
faint
with
the
joy
of
it
all
and
the
pain
of
it
all
joy
in
the
full
knowledge
that
he
loved
her
and
had
spoken
in
spite
of
the
cloud
that
enveloped
her
pain
in
the
certainty
that
she
could
not
accept
the
sacrifice
for
a
long
time
she
sat
staring
straight
down
the
broad
road
over
which
they
were
rolling
wicker
you
must
not
ask
me
now
she
said
at
last
bravely
and
earnestly
it
is
sweet
to
know
that
you
love
me
it
is
life
to
me
yes
life
wicker
but
do
you
see
no
no
you
must
not
expect
it
you
must
not
ask
it
do
do
dear
she
cried
drawing
away
as
he
leaned
toward
her
passion
in
his
eyes
triumph
in
his
face
but
we
love
each
other
he
cried
what
matters
the
rest
i
want
you
have
you
considered
have
you
thought
i
have
a
thousand
times
a
thousand
bitter
thoughts
i
can
not
i
will
not
be
your
your
wife
wicker
until
in
vain
he
argued
pleaded
commanded
she
was
firm
and
she
felt
she
was
right
if
not
just
underneath
it
all
lurked
the
fear
the
dreadful
fear
that
she
may
have
been
a
child
of
love
the
illegitimate
offspring
of
passion
it
was
the
weight
that
crushed
her
almost
to
lifelessness
it
was
the
bar
sinister
no
wicker
i
mean
it
she
said
in
the
end
resolutely
not
until
i
can
give
you
a
name
in
exchange
for
your
own
your
name
shall
one
day
be
bonner
if
i
have
to
wreck
the
social
system
of
the
whole
universe
to
uncover
another
one
for
you
the
automobile
had
been
standing
by
some
extraordinary
chance
in
the
cool
shade
of
a
great
oak
for
ten
minutes
or
more
but
it
was
a
wise
discreet

the

train
robbery
anderson
crow
lived
at
the
extreme
south
end
of
tinkletown
principal
thoroughfare
the
calaboose
was
situated
at
the
far
end
of
main
street
at
least
half
a
mile
separating
the
home
of
the
law
and
the
home
of
the
lawless
marshal
crow
innate
love
for
the
spectacular
alone
explains
the
unneighbourliness
of
the
two
establishments
he
felt
an
inward
glory
in
riding
or
walking
the
full
length
of
the
street
and
he
certainly
had
no
reason
to
suspect
the
populace
of
disregarding
the
outward
glory
he
presented
the
original
plan
of
the
merchantry
comprehended
the
erection
of
the
jail
in
close
proximity
to
the
home
of
its
chief
official
but
crow
put
his
foot
flatly
and
ponderously
upon
the
scheme
with
the
dignity
which
made
him
noticeable
he
said
he
be
doggoned
ef
he
wanted
to
have
people
come
to
his
own
dooryard
to
be
arrested
by
which
it
may
be
inferred
that
he
expected
the
to
choose
his
own
arresting
place
and
crow
were
becoming
thrifty
in
view
of
the
prospect
that
confronted
them
to
wit
the
possible
marriage
of
rosalie
and
the
cutting
off
of
the
yearly
payments
as
she
was
to
be
absent
for
a
full
month
or
more
anderson
conceived
the
idea
of
advertising
for
a
lodger
and
boarder
by
turning
roscoe
out
of
his
bed
they
obtained
a
spare
room
that
looked
down
upon
the
peony
beds
beyond
the
side
portico
crow
was
lazily
twisting
his
meagre
chin
whiskers
one
morning
soon
after
rosalie
departure
he
was
leaning
against
the
town
pump
in
front
of
the
the
sun
glancing
impotently
off
the
bright
badge
on
the
lapel
of
his
alpaca
coat
a
stranger
came
forth
from
the
and
approached
the
marshal
is
this
mr
crow
he
asked
with
considerable
deference
it
is
sir
they
tell
me
you
take
lodgers
depends
my
name
is
gregory
andrew
gregory
and
i
am
here
to
canvass
the
neighbourhood
in
the
interest
of
the
human
life
insurance
company
of
penobscot
if
you
need
references
i
can
procure
them
from
new
york
or
boston
the
stranger
was
a
tall
man
of
forty
or
well
dressed
with
a
brusque
yet
pleasant
manner
of
speech
his
moustache
and
beard
were
black
and
quite
heavy
crow
eyed
him
quietly
for
a
moment
i
do
reckon
i
ask
fer
references
our
rates
are
six
dollars

board
an

childern
bother
you
not
at
all
have
you
any
some
more
or
less
they
mostly
grown
i
will
take
board
and
room
for
two
weeks
at
least
said
gregory
who
seemed
to
be
a
man
of
action
for
almost
a
week
the
insurance
agent
plied
his
vocation
assiduously
but
fruitlessly
the
farmers
and
the
citizens
of
tinkletown
were
slow
to
take
up
insurance
they
would
talk
crops
and
politics
with
the
obliging
gregory
but
that
was
all
and
yet
his
suavity
won
for
him
many
admirers
there
were
not
a
few
who
promised
to
give
him
their
insurance
if
they
concluded
to
take
any
out
only
one
man
in
town
was
willing
to
be
insured
and
he
was
too
old
to
be
comforting
calligan
was
reputed
to
be
one
hundred
and
three
years
of
age
and
he
wanted
the
endowment
plan
gregory
popularised
himself
at
the
crow
home
by
paying
for
his
room
in
advance
moreover
he
was
an
affable
chap
with
a
fund
of
good
stories
straight
from
broadway
at
the
and
in
lamson
store
he
was
soon
established
as
a
mighty
favourite
even
the
women
who
came
to
make
purchases
in
the
evening
a
hitherto
unknown
custom
lingered
outside
the
circle
on
the
porch
revelling
in
the
second
edition
of
the
arabian
nights
our
friend
the
detective
here
he
said
one
night

gregory
that
way
said
anderson
slowly
analysing
the
word
i
understand

is
a
stage
performance
under
a
tent
volunteered
the
postmaster
that

harry

the
advance

and
will
appeal
particularly
to
the
rich
city
people
up
in
the
mountains
it
a
sort
of
affair

then
squires
was
obliged
to
explain

his
all
the
known
details

it
by
the

the
performance

be
given

afternoon
show
asked
williams

harry
curtly

anderson
crow
reflectively
it
a
troupe
the
next
morning
bright
and
early
mark
riley
fared
forth
with
paste
and
brush
before
noon
the
board
fences
barns
and
blank
walls
of
tinkletown
flamed
with
great
red
and
blue
letters
twining
in
and
about
the
portraits
of
shakespeare
manager
boothby
rosalind
orlando
and
an
extra
king
or
two
in
royal
robes
a
dozen
small
boys
spread
the

bills
from

presses
and
tinkletown
was
stirred
by
the
excitement
of
a
sensation
that
had
not
been
experienced
since
forepaugh
circus
visited
the
county
seat
three
years
before
it
went
without
saying
that
manager
boothby
would
present
as
you
like
it
with
an
unrivalled
cast
he
had
an
production
direct
from
the
leading
theatres
of
the
universe
when
mark
riley
started
out
again
in
the
afternoon
for
a
second
excursion
with
paste
and
brush
slapping
up
small
posters
with
a
celerity
that
bespoke
extreme
interest
on
his
part
the
astonished
populace
feared
that
he
was
announcing
a
postponement
of
the
performance
instead
of
that
however
he
was
heralding
the
fact
that
the
hemisphere
trunk
line
and
express
company
would
gladly
pay
ten
thousand
dollars
reward
for
the
apprehension
and
capture
of
the
men
who
robbed
one
of
its
richest
trains
a
few
nights
before
seizing
as
booty
over
sixty
thousand
dollars
in
money
besides
killing
two
messengers
in
cold
blood
the
great
train
robbery
occurred
in
the
western
part
of
the
state
hundreds
of
miles
from
tinkletown
but
nearly
all
of
its
citizens
had
read
accounts
of
the
deed
in
the
weekly
paper
from
boggs
city
i
seen
the
item
about
it
in
gregory
new
york
paper
said
anderson
crow
to
the
crowd
at
lamson
gee
whiz
it
must
been
a
peach
said
isaac
porter
and
eager
for
details
whereupon
marshal
crow
related
the
story
of
the
crime
which
stupefied
the
world
on
the
morning
of
july
the
express
had
been
held
up
in
an
isolated
spot
by
a
masked
men
a
safe
had
been
shattered
and
the
contents
confiscated
the
perpetrators
vanishing
as
completely
as
if
aided
by
satan
himself
the
authorities
were
baffled
a
huge
reward
was
offered
in
the
hope
that
it
might
induce
some
discontented
underling
in
the
band
to
expose
his
comrades
are
you
goin
after
anderson
asked
old
borton
with
unfailing
faith
in
the
town
chief
officer
them
fellers
is
in
asia
by
this
time
vouchsafed
crow
scornfully
forgetting
that
less
than
a
week
had
elapsed
since
the
robbery
he
flecked
a
fly
from
his
detective
badge
and
then
struck
viciously
at
the
same
insect
when
it
straightway
attacked
his
emblem
i
doubt
it
said
lamson
like
as
not
they
right
here
in
this
state
mebby
in
this
county
you
ca
tell
about
them
slick
desperadoes
hello
harry
has
anything
more
been
heard
from
the
train
robbers
harry
squires
approached
the
group
with
something
like
news
in
his
face
i
should
say
so
he
said
the
darned
cusses
robbed
the
state
express
last
night
at
vanderskoop
and
got
away
with
thirteen
hundred
dollars
say
they
wonders
the
engineer
says
they
only
five
of
them
why
gosh
dern
it
vanderskoop
only
the
fourth
station
west
of
boggs
city
exclaimed
anderson
crow
pricking
up
his
official
ear
how
in
thunder
do
you
reckon
they
got
up
here
in
such
a
short
time
they
probably
stopped
off
on
their
way
back
from
asia
drily
remarked
lamson
but
it
passed
unnoticed
have
you
heard
anything
more
about
the
show
harry
asked
jim
borum
is
she
sure
to
be
here
what
did
tinkletown
care
about
the
train
robbers
when
a
show
was
headed
that
way
sure
the
press
comments
are
very
favourable
said
harry
they
all
say
that
miss
marmaduke
who
plays
rosalind
is
great
we
got
a
cut
of
her
and
say
she
a
beauty
i
can
see
myself
sitting
in
the
front
row
next
thursday
night
good
and
proper
say
anderson
i
think
it
a
dern
shame
fer
mark
riley
to
go
pastin
them
reward
bills
over
the
show
pictures
growled
isaac
porter
he
ai
got
a
bit
o
sense
with
one
accord
the
crowd
turned
to
inspect
two
adjacent
bill
boards
mark
had
either
malignantly
or
insanely
pasted
the
reward
notices
over
the
nether
extremities
of
rosalind
as
she
was
expected
to
appear
in
the
forest
of
arden
there
was
a
period
of
reflection
on
the
part
of
an
outraged
constituency
i
do
see
how
he
goin
to
remove
off
them
reward
bills
without
scraping
off
her
legs
at
the
same
time
mused
anderson
crow
in
perplexity
two
housewives
of
tinkletown
suddenly
deserted
the
group
and
entered
the
store
and
so
it
was
that
the
train
robbers
were
forgotten
for
the
time
being
but
marshal
crow
reputation
as
a
taker
and
general
suppressor
of
crime
constantly
upbraided
him
it
seemed
to
call
upon
him
to
take
steps
toward
the
capture
of
the
train
robbers
all
that
afternoon
he
reflected
tinkletown
seeing
his
mood
refrained
from
breaking
in
upon
it
he
was
allowed
to
stroke
his
whiskers
in
peace
and
to
think
to
his
heart
content
by
nightfall
his
face
had
become
an
inscrutable
mask
and
then
it
was
known
that
the
president
of
bramble
county
detective
association
was
determined
to
fathom
the
great
problem
stealthily
he
went
up
to
the
great
attic
in
his
home
and
inspected
his
disguises
in
some
period
of
his
official
career
he
had
purchased
the
most
amazing
collection
of
false
beards
wigs
and
garments
that
any
stranded
comedian
ever
disposed
of
at
a
sacrifice
he
tried
each
separate
article
seeking
for
the
best
individual
effect
then
he
tried
them
collectively
it
would
certainly
have
been
impossible
to
recognise
him
as
anderson
crow
in
truth
no
one
could
safely
have
identified
him
as
a
human
being
i
goin
after
them
raskils
he
announced
to
andrew
gregory
and
the
whole
family
as
he
came
down
late
to
take
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
supper
table
ai
you
goin
to
let
show
here
pop
asked
roscoe
in
distress
show
here
what
air

about
he
means
the
train
robbers
roscoe
explained
the
lad
mother
the
boy
breathed
again
they
are
a
dangerous
lot
volunteered
gregory
who
had
been
in
albany
for
two
days
the
papers
are
full
of
their
deeds
cutthroats
of
the
worst
character
i
let
them
alone
anderson
pleaded
his
wife
if
you
corner
them
they
shoot
and
it
would
be
jest
like
you
to
follow
them
right
into
their
lair
consarn
it
eva
do
you
that
i
shoot
too
snorted
anderson
what
you
reckon
i
been
keepin
them
loaded
revolvers
out
in
the
barn
all
these
years
fer
jest
fer
ornaments
not
much
to
shoot
with
ef
anybody
asks
you
thunderation
gregory
you
no
idee
how
a
feller
can
be
handicapped
by
a
timid
wife
an
a
lot
fool
childern
i
almost
afeard
to
turn
fer
fear
they
be
skeered
to
death
fer
my
safety
you
cut
yourself
with
a
razor
once
when
ma
told
you
not
to
try
to
shave
the
back
of
your
neck
by
yourself
said
one
of
the
girls
she
wanted
you
to
let
beck
shave
it
for
you
but
you
would
have
it
that
way
do
you
suppose
i
want
an
undertaker
shavin
my
neck
i
not
that
anxious
to
be
shaved
beck
the
undertaker
mr
gregory
well
he
runs
the
barber
shop
too
insisted
the
girl
during
the
next
three
days
tinkletown
saw
but
little
of
its
marshal
fire
chief
and
street
commissioner
that
triple
personage
was
off
on
business
of
great
import
early
each
morning
he
mysteriously
stole
away
to
the
woods
either
up
or
down
the
river
carrying
a
queer
bundle
under
the
seat
of
his
buckboard
two
revolvers
neither
of
which
had
been
discharged
for
ten
years
reposed
in
a
box
fastened
to
the
dashboard
anderson
solemnly
but
positively
refused
to
allow
any
one
to
accompany
him
nor
would
he
permit
any
one
to
question
him
farmers
coming
to
town
spoke
of
seeing
him
in
the
lanes
and
in
the
woods
but
he
had
winked
genially
when
they
had
asked
what
he
was
trailing
he
after
the
train
robbers
explained
all
tinkletown
soberly
whereupon
the
farmers
and
their
wives
did
not
begrudge
anderson
crow
the
chicken
dinners
he
had
eaten
with
them
nor
did
they
blame
him
for
bothering
the
men
in
the
fields
it
was
sufficient
that
he
found
excuse
to
sleep
in
the
shade
of
their
trees
during
his
still
hunt
got
any
track
of
asked
george
ray
one
evening
stopping
at
anderson
back
gate
to
watch
the
marshal
unhitch
his
thankful
nag
patience
had
ceased
to
be
a
virtue
with
george
any
track
of
who
asked
crow
with
a
fine
show
of
innocence
the
robbers
i
ai
been
trackin
robbers
george
what
in
thunder
have
you
been
trackin
all
over
the
country
every
day
then
i
breakin
this
colt
calmly
replied
the
marshal
with
a
mighty
wink
at
old
betty
whom
he
had
driven
to
the
same
buckboard
for
twenty
years
as
george
departed
with
an
insulted
snort
andrew
gregory
came
from
the
barn
where
he
had
been
awaiting
the
return
of
mr
crow
i
next
to
something
big
he
announced
in
a
low
tone
first
looking
in
all
directions
to
see
that
no
one
was
listening
gosh
did
you
land
mr
farnsworth
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
insurance
hastily
explained
the
agent
i
heard
something
of
vast
importance
to
you
you
do
mean
to
say
the
troupe
has
busted
no
no
it
is
in
connection
with
with
and
here
gregory
leaned
forward
and
whispered
something
in
anderson
ear
crow
promptly
stopped
dead
still
in
his
tracks
his
eyes
bulging
betty
who
was
being
led
to
the
water
trough
being
blind
and
having
no
command
to
halt
proceeded
to
bump
forcibly
against
her
master
frame
chapter

as
you

so
whoa

ye
cai
you

where
you
goin
you
old
rip

jerked
to
a
standstill
what

asked
anderson
his
voice
shaking
with
interest
i
ca
tell
you
out
here
said
the
other
cautiously
put
up
the
nag
and
then
meet
me
in
the
pasture
out
there
we
can
sit
down
and
talk
and
not
be
overheard
i
wo
be
a
minute

lively
now

ma

to
supper
when
we
git
good
an
ready
anderson
and
andrew
gregory
strode
through
the
pasture
gate
and
far
out
into
the
green
meadow
once
entirely
out
of
hearing
gregory
stopped
and
both
sat
down
upon
a
little
hillock
the
agent
was
evidently
suppressing
considerable
excitement
those
train
robbers
are
in
this
neighbourhood
he
said
breaking
a
long
silence
anderson
looked
behind
involuntarily
i
do
mean
that
they
are
in
this
pasture
crow
you
been
a
good
friend
to
me
and
i
inclined
to
share
the
secret
with
you
if
we
go
together
we
may
divide
the
reward
because
i
quite
sure
we
can
land
those
chaps
what
your
plan
asked
anderson
turning
a
little
pale
at
the
thought
before
going
any
further
into
the
matter
gregory
asked
anderson
if
he
would
sign
a
paper
agreeing
to
divide
the
reward
equally
with
him
this
point
was
easily
settled
and
then
the
insurance
man
unfolded
his
secret
i
have
a
straight
tip
from
a
friend
in
new
york
and
he
would
steer
me
wrong
the
truth
about
him
is
this
he
used
to
work
for
our
company
but
took
some
money
that
did
belong
to
him
it
got
him
a
sentence
in
the
pen
he
just
out
and
he
knows
a
whole
lot
about
these
robbers
some
of
them
were
in
sing
sing
with
him
the
leader
wanted
him
to
join
the
gang
and
he
consented
his
duty
is
to
keep
the
gang
posted
on
what
the
officers
in
new
york
are
doing
see
of
course
breathed
anderson
well
my
friend
wants
to
reform
all
he
asks
is
a
slice
of
the
reward
if
we
capture
the
gang
we
can
afford
to
give
him
a
thousand
or
so
ca
we
of
course
was
the
dignified
response
here
his
letter
to
me
i
read
it
to
you
in
the
gathering
dusk
gregory
read
the
letter
to
the
marshal
of
tinkletown
now
you
see
he
said
at
the
close
of
the
astounding
epistle
this
means
that
if
we
observe
strict
secrecy
we
may
have
the
game
in
our
hands
no
one
must
hear
a
word
of
this
they
may
have
spies
right
here
in
tinkletown
we
can
succeed
only
by
keeping
our
mouths
sealed
beeswax
promised
anderson
crow
briefly
the
letter
to
andrew
gregory
was
an
exposure
of
the
plans
of
the
great
gang
together
with
their
whereabouts
on
a
certain
day
to
come
they
were
to
swoop
down
on
tinkletown
on
the
night
of
the
performance
of
as
you
like
it
and
their
most
desperate
coup
was
to
be
the
result
the
scheme
was
to
hold
up
and
rob
the
entire
audience
while
the
performance
was
going
on
anderson
crow
was
in
a
cold
perspiration
the
performance
was
but
three
days
off
and
he
felt
that
he
required
three
months
for
preparation
how
in
thunder
are
we
goin
to
capture
that
awful
gang
jest
you
me
he
asked
voicing
his
doubts
and
fears
we
have
to
engage
help
that
all
we
need
a
regiment
do
you
think
it
buck
up
old
fellow
do
be
afraid
afeerd
me
i
do
know
what
it
is
to
be
skeered
did
you
ever
hear
about
how
i
landed
them
fellers
that
kidnaped
my
daughter
rosalie
well
you
jest
ast
some
one
knows
about
it
umph
i
guess
that
was
a
recommend
fer
bravery
but
these
fellers
will
be
ready
fer
us
they
we
can
trick
them
easily
i
been
thinking
of
a
plan
all
afternoon
we
do
know
just
where
they
are
now
so
we
ca
rake
them
in
we
have
to
wait
until
they
come
to
us
my
plan
is
to
have
a
competent
private
detectives
up
from
new
york
we
can
scatter
them
through
the
audience
next
thursday
night
and
when
the
right
time
comes
we
can
land
on
every
one
of
those
fellows
like
hawks
on
spring
chickens
i
know
the
chief
of
a
big
private
agency
in
new
york
and
i
think
the
best
plan
is
to
have
him
send
up
some
good
men
it
wo
cost
much
and
i
rather
have
those
fearless
practical
men
here
than
all
the
rubes
you
could
deputise
one
of
is
worth
ten
of
your
crow
begging
your
pardon
for
the
remark
you
and
i
can
keep
the
secret
and
we
can
do
the
right
thing
but
we
would
be
asses
to
take
more
tinkletown
asses
into
our
confidence
if
you
agree
write
to
pinkerton
this
evening
he
can
have
his
men
here
disguised
and
ready
for
work
by
thursday
afternoon
if
you
do
mind
i
like
to
have
you
take
charge
of
the
affair
because
you
know
just
how
to
handle
thieves
and
i
do
what
say
you
anderson
was
ready
and
eager
to
agree
to
anything
but
he
hesitated
a
long
time
before
concluding
to
take
supreme
charge
of
the
undertaking
gregory
at
once
implored
him
to
take
command
it
meant
the
success
of
the
venture
anything
else
meant
failure
but
thunder
am
i
to
know
the
robbers
when
i
see
demanded
the
marshal
nervously
pulling
bluegrass
up
by
the
roots
you
know
all
right
said
andrew
gregory
thursday
came
and
with
it
the
troupe
anderson
crow
had
not
slept
for
three
nights
he
was
so
full
of
thrills
and
responsibility
bright
and
early
that
morning
he
was
on
the
lookout
for
suspicious
characters
gregory
was
to
meet
the
detectives
from
new
york
at
seven
in
the
evening
by
previous
arrangement
these
strangers
were
to
congregate
casually
at
tinkletown
inn
perfectly
diguised
as
gentlemen
ready
for
instructions
the
two
had
carefully
devised
a
plan
of
action
gregory
chuckled
secretly
when
he
thought
of
the
sensation
tinkletown
was
to
experience
and
he
thought
of
it
often
too
the
leading
members
of
boothby
all
star
company
put
up
at
the
inn
which
was
so
humble
that
it
staggered
beneath
this
unaccustomed
weight
of
dignity
the
beautiful
miss
marmaduke
in
reality
miss
cora
miller
was
there

the
manager
a
busy
and
preoccupied
person
who
looked
to
be
the
lowliest
hireling
in
the
party
came
to
the
inn
at
noon
and
spread
the
news
that
the
reserved
seats
were
sold
out
and
there
was
promise
of
a
fine
crowd
whereupon
there
was
rejoicing
among
the
all

of

added
miss
marmaduke
cheerfully
she
was
a
very
pretty
young
woman
and
desperately
in
love
with
orlando
if
any
one
seized
orlando

i
could
appear

said
jackie
blake
and
before
tinkletown
could
take
its
second
gasp
for
breath
the
leading
man
and
woman
were
slowly
promenading
the
chief
and
only
thoroughfare
by
ginger
she
a
purty
one
ai
she
murmured
ed
higgins
sole
clerk
at
lamson
he
stood
in
the
doorway
until
she
was
out
of
sight
and
remained
there
for
nearly
an
hour
awaiting
her
return
the
men
of
tinkletown
took
but
one
look
at
the
pretty
young
woman
but
that
one
look
was
continuous
and
unbroken
if
this
jay
town
can
turn
up
enough
money
to
keep
us
from
stranding
i
take
off
my
hat
to
it
for
ever
more
said
jackie
blake
boothby
says
the
house
is
sold
out
said
miss
marmaduke
a
shade
of
anxiety
in
her
dark
eyes
oh
how
i
wish
we
were
at
home
again
i
rather
starve
in
new
york
than
feast
in
the
high
hills
said
he
wistfully
the
idols
to
whom
tinkletown
was
paying
homage
were
but
human
after
all
for
two
months
the
boothby
company
had
been
buffeted
from
pillar
to
post
struggling
hard
to
keep
its
head
above
water
always
expecting
the
crash
the
were
no
more
than
striving
young
thespians
who
were
kept
playing
throughout
the
heated
term
with
this
uncertain
enterprise
solely
because
necessity
was
in
command
of
their
destinies
it
was
not
for
them
to
enjoy
a
summer
in
ease
and
indolence
never
mind
dear
said
she
turning
her
green
parasol
so
that
it
obstructed
the
intense
but
complimentary
gaze
of
no
less
than
a
dozen
men
our
luck
will
change
we
wo
be
for
ever
we
one
thing
to
be
thankful
for
little
woman
said
jackie
his
face
brightening
we
go
out
again
this
fall
in
the
same
company
luck
is
it
we
be
married
as
soon
as
we
get
back
to
new
york
and
we
wo
have
to
be
separated
for
a
whole
season
at
least
is
it
dear
to
think
of
jackie
sweetheart
a
whole
season
and
then
another
and
then
all
of
them
after
that
oh
dear
wo
it
be
sweet
it
was
love
young
dream
for
both
of
them
hello
what
this
exclaimed
orlando
the
thousandth
pausing
before
a
placard
which
covered
the
lower
limbs
of
his
pictorial
partner
ten
thousand
dollars
reward
great
scott
cora
would
i
like
to
catch
those
fellows
great
eh
but
it
a
desperate
gang
the
worst
ever
just
then
both
became
conscious
of
the
fact
that
some
one
was
scrutinising
them
intently
from
behind
they
turned
and
beheld
anderson
crow
his
badges
glistening
how
are
you
officer
said
jackie
cheerily
miss
marmaduke
in
her
happiness
beamed
a
smile
upon
the
austere
man
with
the
chin
whiskers
anderson
was
past
seventy
but
that
smile
caused
the
intake
of
his
breath
to
almost
lift
him
from
the
ground
first
rate
thanks
how
yourself
readin
the
reward
notice
lem
me
tell
you
something
there
goin
to
be
somethin
happen
tarnation
soon
that
will
astonish
them
fellers
ef
but
here
anderson
pulled
up
with
a
jerk
realising
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
betraying
a
great
secret
afraid
to
trust
himself
in
continued
conversation
he
abruptly
said
good
afternoon
and
started
off
down
the
street
his
ears
tingling
queer
old
chap
is
he
observed
jackie
and
immediately
forgot
him
as
they
strolled
onward
that
evening
tinkletown
swarmed
with
strangers
the
weather
was
fine
and
scores
of
the
summer
dwellers
in
the
hills
across
the
river
came
over
to
see
the
performance
as
the
advance
agent
had
predicted
bluff
top
hotel
sent
a
large
delegation
of
people
seeking
the
variety
of
life
there
were
automobiles
traps
victorias
and
sundowns
standing
all
along
the
street
in
the
vicinity
of
hapgood
grove
it
was
to
be
in
the
expansive
language
of
the
press
agent
a
cultured
audience
made
up
of
the
élite
of
the
community
late
in
the
afternoon
a
paralysing
thought
struck
in
upon
the
brain
it
occurred
to
him
that
this
band
of
robbers
might
also
be
engaged
to
carry
off
rosalie
gray
after
all
it
might
be
the
great
dominant
reason
for
their
descent
upon
the
community
covered
with
a
perspiration
that
was
not
caused
by
heat
he
accosted
wicker
bonner
the
minute
that
gentleman
arrived
in
town
rosalie
went
of
course
to
the
crow
home
for
a
short
visit
with
the
family
say
wick
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favour
said
anderson
eagerly
taking
the
young
man
aside
i
cai
tell
you
all
about
it
i
bound
by
a
deathless
oath
but
listen
i
afraid
somethin
goin
to
happen
there
a
lot
o
strangers
here
an
i
nervous
about
rosalie
somebody
might
try
to
steal
her
in
the
excitement
now
i
want
you
to
take
good
keer
of
her
do
let

your
sight

keep
my
eye
on
her
too

crow
i
look
out
for
her
that
what
i
hope
to
do
all
the
rest
of
somethin
liable
to
happen
crow
broke
in
and
then
quietly
slipped
away
bonner
laughed
easily
at
the
old
man
fears
and
set
them
down
as
a
part
of
his
whimsical
nature
later
he
saw
the
old
man
near
the
entrance
as
the
party
passed
inside
the
inclosure
the
bonner
party
occupied
prominent
seats
in
front
reserved
by
the
marshal
there
were
ten
in
the
group
a
young
boston
people
completing
the
house
party
the
side
walls
of
a
pavilion
inclosed
the
most
beautiful
section
of
the
grove
in
one
end
were
the
seats
rapidly
filling
with
people
at
the
opposite
end
upon
mother
earth
green
carpet
was
the
stage
lighted
dimly
by
means
of
subdued
spot
lights
and
a
few
auxiliary
stars
on
high
there
was
no
scenery
save
that
provided
by
nature
herself
an
orchestra
of
violins
broke
through
the
constant
hum
of
eager
voices
anderson
crow
heart
was
inside
the
charmed
inclosure
but
his
person
was
elsewhere
simultaneously
with
the
beginning
of
the
performance
of
as
you
like
it
he
was
in
his
own
confronting
andrew
gregory
and
the
five
bewhiskered
assistants
from
new
york
city
gregory
had
met
the
detectives
at
the
inn
and
had
guided
them
to
the
marshal
barn
where
final
instructions
were
to
be
given
for
half
an
hour
the
party
discussed
plans
with
anderson
crow
speaking
in
low
mysterious
tones
that
rang
in
the
marshal
ears
to
his
dying
day
we
located
those
fellows
asserted
gregory
firmly
there
can
be
no
mistake
they
are
already
in
the
audience
over
there
and
at
a
signal
will
set
to
work
to
hold
up
the
whole
crowd
we
must
get
the
drop
on
them
crow
do
do
that
you
do
need
a
disguise
keep
those
yellow
whiskers
in
your
pocket
the
rest
of
us
will
wear
disguises
these
men
came
here
disguised
because
the
robbers
would
be
onto
them
in
a
minute
if
they
did
they
know
every
detective
face
in
the
land
if
it
were
not
for
these
beards
and
wigs
they
have
spotted
pinkerton
men
long
ago
now
you
know
your
part
in
the
affair
do
you
yes
sir
respectfully
responded
anderson
his
chin
whisker
wobbling
pathetically
then
we
ready
to
proceed
it
takes
a
little
nerve
that
all
but
we
soon
have
those
robbers
just
where
we
want
them
said
andrew
gregory
the
second
act
of
the
play
was
fairly
well
under
way
when
orlando
in
the
green
room
remarked
to
the
stage
director
what
that
old
rube
doing
back
here
ramsay
why
hang
it
man
carrying
a
couple
of
guns
is
this
a
at
the
same
instant
rosalind
and
two
of
the
women
came
rushing
from
their
dressing
tent
alarmed
and
indignant
miss
marmaduke
her
eyes
blazing
confronted
the
stage
director
what
does
this
mean
mr
ramsay
she
cried
that
old
man
ordered
us
out
of
our
at
the
point
of
a
revolver
and
see
there
he
is
now
doing
the
same
to
the
men
it
was
true
anderson
crow
with
a
brace
of
horse
pistols
was
driving
the
players
toward
the
centre
of
the
stage
in
a
tremulous
voice
he
commanded
them
to
remain
there
and
take
the
consequences
a
moment
later
the
marshal
of
tinkletown
strode
into
the
limelight
with
his
arsenal
facing
an
astonished
and
temporarily
amused
audience
his
voice
pitched
high
with
excitement
reached
to
the
remotest
corners
of
the
inclosure
behind
him
the
players
were
looking
on
and
bewildered
to
them
he
loomed
up
as
the
constable
detailed
to
attach
their
personal
effects
the
audience
if
at
first
it
laughed
at
him
as
a
joke
soon
changed
its
view
commotion
followed
his
opening
speech
chapter
xxxii
the
luck
of
anderson
crow
do
anybody
attempt
to
leave
this
tent
commanded
crow
standing
bravely
forth
with
his
levelled
revolvers
the
orchestra
made
itself
as
small
as
possible
for
one
of
the
guns
wavered
dangerously
do

he
waited
impressively
but
either
through
stupefaction
or
obstinacy
the
robbers
failed
to
lift
their
hands
you
cornered
you
golderned
scamps
shouted
anderson
crow
an
you
might
jest
as

give

gasped
judge
brewster
from
across
the
river
he
crazy
cried
congressman
bonner
let
everybody
in
this
crowd
throw
up
their
hands
called
a
firm
clear
voice
from
the
entrance
at
the
same
instant
five
bewhiskered
individuals
appeared
as
if
by
magic
with
drawn
revolvers
dominating
the
situation
completely
the
speaker
was
andrew
gregory
the
insurance
agent
now
what
have
you
got
to
say
cried
anderson
gaily
i
guess
me
the
detectives
have
you
cornered
all
right
ai
we
the
audience
sat
stupefied
paralysed
while
all
this
was
going
on
upon
the
inside
a
single
detective
on
the
outside
was
stealthily
puncturing
the
tires
of
every
automobile
in
the
collection
bracken
huge
touring
car
being
excepted
for
reasons
to
be
seen
later
on
good
heavens
groaned
old
judge
brewster
a
half
dozen
women
fainted
and
a
hundred
men
broke
into
a
cold
perspiration
hands
up
everybody
commanded
andrew
gregory
we
can
take
no
chances
the
train
robbers
are
in
this
audience
they
came
to
hold
up
the
entire
crowd
but
we
are
too
quick
for
you
my
fine
birds
the
place
is
surrounded
gregory
the
insurance
began
anderson
crow
but
he
was
cut
short
crow
deserves
great
credit
for
this
piece
of
detective
work
his
mere
presence
is
a
guaranty
of
safety
to
those
of
you
who
are
not
thieves
you
all
have
your
hands
up
thanks
crow
please
keep
those
actors
quiet
now
ladies
and
gentlemen
it
is
not
always
an
easy
matter
to
distinguish
thieves
from
honest
men
i
will
first
give
the
desperadoes
a
chance
to
surrender
peaceably
no
one
steps
forward
very
well
keep
your
hands
up
all
of
you
the
man
who
lowers
his
hands
will
be
instantly
regarded
as
a
desperado
and
may
get
a
bullet
in
his
body
for
his
folly
the
innocent
must
suffer
with
the
guilty
crow
shall
we
proceed
with
the
search
yes
sir
go
right
ahead
and
be
quick
replied
anderson
crow
very
well
then
in
the
name
of
the
law
my
men
will
begin
the
search
they
will
pass
among
you
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
any
effort
to
retard
their
progress
will
be
met
with
instant
well
you
know
before
the
petrified
audience
could
fully
realise
what
was
taking
place
three
of
the
detectives
were
swiftly
passing
from
person
to
person
stripping
the
women
of
their
jewels
the
men
of
their
money
and
their
watches
a
protest
went
up
to
anderson
crow
but
it
was
checked
summarily
by
the
searching
party
it
was
well
for
the
poor
marshal
that
he
never
knew
what
the
audience
thought
of
him
at
that
ghastly
moment
it
was
all
over
in
five
minutes
the
detectives
had
searched
every
person
in
the
audience
under
the
very
nose
and
guns
of
marshal
crow
and
they
were
sardonically
bidding
the
assemblage
a
fond
from
the
flapping
doorway
in
the
side
wall
andrew
gregory
addressed
the
crowd
smiling
broadly
we
found
a
good
many
more
robbers
in
the
crowd
than
we
could
conveniently
handle
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
fact
i
never
came
across
such
a
rare
collection
of
men
outside
of
wall
street
the
only
perfectly
honest
man
in
tinkletown
is
anderson
crow
your
esteemed
marshal
believe
me
he
is
ridiculously
honest
he
may
be
a
damn
fool
but
he
is
honest
do
blame
him
thanking
you
one
and
all
for
your
generous
help
in
our
search
for
the
train
robbers
we
bid
you
an
affectionate
farewell
we
may
meet
again
if
you
travel
extensively
on
express
trains
with
a
taunting
laugh
andrew
gregory
dropped
the
flap
and
leaped
after
his
companions
bracken
chauffeur
lay
senseless
by
the
roadside
and
one
of
the
detectives
sat
in
his
seat
even
as
the
audience
opened
its
collective
mouth
to
shout
its
wrath
and
surprise
the
big
touring
car
with
six
armed
men
aboard
leaped
away
with
a
rush
down
the
dark
road
it
flew
like
an
express
train
its
own
noise
drowning
the
shouts
of
the
multitude
far
behind
bonner
recovering
from
his
stupefaction
and
rage
led
the
pursuit
first
commanding
rosalie
to
hurry
home
with
the
women
and
lock
herself
safely
indoors
anderson
crow
realising
what
a
dupe
he
had
been
in
the
hands
of
the
clever
scoundrels
was
covered
with
fear
and
shame
the
outraged
crowd
might
have
killed
him
had
not
his
escape
been
made
under
cover
of
darkness
shivering
and
moaning
in
abject
misery
the
pride
of
tinkletown
fled
unseeing
unthinking
into
the
forest
along
the
river
he
was
not
to
know
until
afterward
that
his
detectives
had
stripped
the
rich
sojourners
of
at
least
ten
thousand
dollars
in
money
and
jewels
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
that
the
performance
of
as
you
like
it
came
to
an
abrupt
end
because
it
was
not
as
they
liked
it
everybody
knew
by
this
time
that
they
had
seen
the
celebrated
train
robbers
jackie
blake
was
half
dressed
when
he
leaped
to
his
feet
with
an
exclamation
so
loud
that
those
preceding
it
were
whispers
holy
smoke
fell
from
his
lips
and
then
he
dashed
across
the
green
to
the
women
dressing
tent
cora
cora
come
out
i
ca
came
back
in
muffled
tones
then
i
off
he
shouted
that
brought
her
partially
dressed
from
the
tent
say
do
you
remember
the
river
road
we
walked
over
well
those
fellows
went
in
that
direction
did
they
do
you
see
are
you
on
the
washout
if
they
do
know
about
it
the
whole
bunch
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
or
in
the
river
by
this
time
mum
the
word
there
a
chance
darling
the
reward
said
or
alive
i
off
she
tried
to
call
him
back
but
it
was
too
late
with
his
own
revolver
in
his
hand
the
half
orlando
half
blake
tore
down
the
rarely
travelled
river
road
south
behind
him
tinkletown
raved
and
wailed
over
the
great
calamity
but
generally
stood
impotent
in
the
face
of
it
all
but
few
felt
inclined
to
pursue
the
robbers
blake
soon
had
the
race
to
himself
it
was
a
mile
or
more
to
the
washout
in
the
road
but
the
excitement
made
him
keen
for
the
test
the
road
ran
through
the
woods
and
along
the
high
bluff
that
overlooked
the
river
he
did
not
know
it
but
this
same
road
was
a
short
cut
to
the
macadam
pike
farther
south
by
taking
this
route
the
robbers
gave
boggs
city
a
wide
berth
blake
mind
was
full
of
the
possibilities
of
disaster
to
the
fugitives
the
washout
was
fresh
and
he
was
counting
on
the
chance
that
they
were
not
aware
of
its
existence
if
they
struck
it
even
at
half
speed
the
whole
party
would
be
hurled
a
hundred
feet
down
to
the
edge
of
the
river
or
into
the
current
itself
in
that
event
some
if
not
all
would
be
seriously
injured
as
he
neared
the
turn
in
the
road
his
course
pointed
out
to
him
by
the
stars
above
he
was
startled
half
out
of
his
boots
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
man
who
staggered
from
the
roadside
and
wobbled
painfully
away
pleading
for
mercy
halt
or
i
shoot
called
jackie
blake
and
the
pathetic
figure
not
only
halted
but
sat
down
in
the
middle
of
the
road
for
the
lord
sake
do
shoot
groaned
a
hoarse
voice
i
was
in
cahoots
with
them
they
fooled
me
they
fooled
me
it
was
anderson
crow
and
he
would
have
gone
on
interminably
had
not
jackie
blake
stopped
him
short
you
the
marshal
eh
the
darned
rube
yes
i
him
call
me
anything
only
do
shoot
who
are
you
groaned
anderson
rising
to
his
knees
he
was
holding
his
revolvers
by
the
muzzles
never
mind
who
i
am
i
have
time
say
you
better
come
with
me
maybe
we
can
head
off
those
villains
they
came
this
way
and
show
to
me
roared
anderson
recognising
a
friend
rage
surged
up
and
drove
out
the
shame
in
his
soul
i
tackle
the
hull
caboodle
dang
and
he
meant
it
too
blake
did
not
stop
to
explain
but
started
on
commanding
crow
to
follow
with
rare
the
marshal
donned
his
yellow
beard
as
he
panted
in
the
trail
of
the
lithe
young
actor
the
latter
remembered
that
the
odds
were
heavily
against
him
the
marshal
might
prove
a
valuable
aid
in
case
of
resistance
provided
of
course
that
they
came
upon
the
robbers
in
the
plight
he
was
hoping
for
where
the
dickens
are
you
wheezed
the
marshal
kicking
up
a
great
dust
in
the
rear
the
other
did
not
answer
his
whole
soul
was
enveloped
in
the
hope
that
the
washout
had
trapped
the
robbers
he
was
almost
praying
that
it
might
be
so
the
reward
could
be
divided
with
the
poor
old
marshal
if
he
gave
a
yell
of
delight
an
instant
later
and
then
began
jumping
straight
up
and
down
like
one
demented
anderson
crow
stopped
so
abruptly
that
his
knees
were
stiff
for
weeks
jackie
blake
wild
dream
had
come
true
the
huge
automobile
had
struck
the
washout
and
it
was
now
lying
at
the
base
of
the
bluff
smashed
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
by
the
dim
light
from
the
heavens
blake
could
see
the
black
hulk
down
there
but
it
was
too
dark
to
distinguish
other
objects
he
was
about
to
descend
to
the
river
bank
when
anderson
crow
came
up
what
the
matter
man
panted
he
they
down
there
do
you
see
it
they
went
over
the
bluff
right
here
come
on
we
got
hold
on
exclaimed
anderson
grasping
his
arm
do
rush
down
there
like
a
danged
fool
if
they
alive
they
can
plug
you
full
of
bullets
in
no
time
let
be
careful
by
thunder
you
right
you
a
wise
old
owl
after
all
i
never
thought
of
that
let
reconnoitre
tingling
with
excitement
the
two
oddly
mated
pursuers
descended
stealthily
by
a
roundabout
way
they
climbed
over
rocks
and
crept
through
underbrush
until
finally
they
came
to
a
clear
spot
not
twenty
feet
from
where
the
great
machine
was
lying
at
the
very
edge
of
the
swift
deep
current
they
heard
groans
and
faint
cries
with
now
and
then
a
piteous
oath
from
their
hiding
place
they
counted
the
forms
of
four
men
lying
upon
the
rocks
as
if
dead
the
two
held
a
whispered
consultation
of
war
a
plan
of
action
resulting
surrender
shouted
jackie
blake
standing
forth
he
and
anderson
had
their
pistols
levelled
upon
the
prostrate
robbers
for
answer
there
were
louder
groans
a
fiercer
oath
or
two
and
then
a
weak
voice
came
out
to
them
for
god
sake
get
this
machine
off
my
legs
i
dying
help
help
we
surrender
ten
minutes
later
the
jubilant
captors
had
released
the
miserable
andrew
gregory
from
his
position
beneath
the
machine
and
had
successfully
bound
the
hands
and
feet
of
five
men
gregory
legs
were
crushed
and
one
other
skull
was
cracked
the
sixth
man
was
nowhere
to
be
found
the
disaster
had
been
complete
the
downfall
of
the
great
train
robbers
inglorious
looking
up
into
the
face
of
anderson
crow
gregory
smiled
through
his
pain
and
said
hoarsely
damned
rotten
luck
but
if
we
had
to
be
taken
i
glad
you
did
it
crow
you
a
good
fool
anyway
but
for
god
sake
get
me
to
a
doctor
dang
it
i
sorry
fer
you
gregory
began
anderson
ready
to
cry
do
waste
your
time
old
man
i
need
the
doctor
are
the
others
dead
he
groaned
i
do
know
replied
jackie
blake
some
of
them
look
like
it
we
ca
carry
you
up
that
hill
but
we
do
the
next
best
thing
marshal
i
stay
here
and
guard
the
prisoners
while
you
run
to
the
village
for
help
and
doctors
and
run
fast
anderson
added
gregory
you
always
were
so
devilish
slow
do
soon
afterward
when
anderson
fagged
but
overjoyed
hobbled
into
the
village
the
excited
crowd
was
ready
to
lynch
him
but
with
his
first
words
the
atmosphere
changed
where
is
jackie
blake
sobbed
a
pretty
young
woman
grasping
the
proud
marshal
arm
and
shaking
him
violently
derned
if
i
know
was
he
stole
she
made
him
understand
and
together
followed
by
the
actors
the
audience
and
the
whole
town
they
led
the
way
to
the
washout
the
fair
rosalind
dragging
the
overworked
hero
of
the
hour
along
at
a
gait
which
threatened
to
be
his
undoing
later
on
after
the
five
bandits
had
been
carried
to
the
village
jackie
blake
gladly
informed
his
sweetheart
that
they
could
have
easy
sailing
with
the
seven
thousand
dollars
he
expected
anderson
crow
had
agreed
to
take
but
three
thousand
dollars
for
his
share
in
the
capture
one
of
the
robbers
was
dead
the
body
of
the
sixth
was
found
in
the
river
weeks
afterward
i
glad
i
was
the
first
on
the
ground
said
blake
in
anticipation
of
the
reward
which
was
eventually
to
be
handed
over
to
him
but
anderson
crow
turned
out
to
be
a
regular
trump
after
all
he
a
corker
he
was
speaking
to
wicker
bonner
and
a
crowd
of
new
yorkers
tinkletown
began
to
talk
of
a
monument
to
anderson
crow
even
while
he
lived
the
general
opinion
was
that
it
should
be
erected
while
he
was
still
able
to
enjoy
it
and
not
after
his
death
when
he
would
not
know
anything
about
its
size
and
cost
by
gosh
was
a
great
capture
swelling
perceptibly
i
knowed
they
could
escape
me
dang
they
did
figger
on
me

they
pshaw
it
was
reediculus
of

to
confess

anderson
said
george
ray

washout

it
snorted
anderson
witheringly
why
good
gosh

i
purty
near
run
my
legs
off
to
git
there
in
time
to
throw
down
the
barricade
before
they
could
get
there
with
automobile
thunderation
what

fool
question
chapter
xxxiii
bill
briggs
tells
a
tale
tinkletown
fairly
bubbled
with
excitement
at
last
the
eyes
of
the
world
were
upon
it
news
of
the
great
sensation
was
flashed
to
the
end
of
the
earth
every
detail
was
gone
into
with
harrowing
minuteness
the
hemisphere
company
announced
by
telegraph
that
it
stood
ready
to
hand
over
the
ten
thousand
dollars
and
the
sheriff
of
bramble
county
with
all
the
united
states
deputy
marshals
within
reach
raced
at
once
to
tinkletown
to
stick
a
finger
in
the
pie
the
morning
after
the
great
pavilion
robbery
as
it
was
called
in
the
anderson
crow
and
bonner
fared
forth
early
to
have
a
look
at
the
injured
desperadoes
all
of
whom
were
safely
under
guard
at
the
reincarnated
calaboose
fifty
armed
men
had
stood
guard
all
night
long
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
one
robber
was
dead
and
the
others
so
badly
injured
that
they
were
not
expected
to
survive
the
day
a
horseman
passed
the
marshal
and
his
friend
near
the
riding
rapidly
to
the
north
he
waved
his
crop
pleasantly
to
them
and
bonner
responded
anderson
stopped
stock
still
and
tried
to
speak
but
did
not
succeed
for
a
full
minute
he
was
dumb
with
excitement
that
him
he
managed
to
gasp
the
feller
i
saw
the
other
day
the
man
on
horseback
that
cried
bonner
laughing
heartily
why
that
is
john
barnes
the
lawyer
and
probably
a
united
states
senator
some
day
good
heavens
crow
you
made
a
bad
guess
of
it
this
time
he
is
staying
with
judge
brewster
his
what
well
by
geminy
i
thought
i
knowed
him
cried
anderson
they
cai
fool
me
long
wick
none
of
he
the
same
feller
run
away
with
judge
brewster
daughter
twenty
year
ago
gosh
i
was
standin
right
on
this
very
spot
the
first
time
i
ever
see
him
he
sold
me
a
hoss
and
buggy
but
i
got
the
money
back
i
arrested
him
the
same
day
arrested
john
barnes
in
amazement
yep
fer
murder
only
he
was
the
murderer
we
follered
him
down
the
river
him
an
the
girl
to
bracken
place
but
they
were
married
afore
we
got
there
doggone
that
was
a
busy
day
some
blamed
good
detective
work
was
did
too
i
and
barnes
was
interested
in
rosalie
asked
bonner
suddenly
how
could
he
have
known
anything
about
her
that
what
puzzles
me
she
came
here
about
two
years
after
the
elopement
more
er
less
but
i
do
remember
ever
seein
him
after
that
time
it
very
strange
crow
reflected
bonner
soberly
he
has
a
son
i
know
his
wife
died
a
year
or
so
after
the
boy
birth
young
barnes
is
about
i
think
at
this
time
by
george
i
heard
it
said
that
barnes
and
his
wife
were
not
hitting
it
off
very
well
they
say
she
died
of
a
broken
heart
i
heard
mother
speak
of
it
often
i
wonder
great
heavens
it
is
possible
that
rosalie
can
be
connected
in
any
way
with
john
barnes
anderson
crow
i
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
possibility
bonner
was
quivering
with
excitement
wonder
and
unbelief
i
workin
on
that
clew
said
anderson
as
calmly
as
his
tremors
would
permit
he
was
thrilled
by
the
mere
suggestion
but
it
was
second
nature
for
him
to
act
as
if
every
discovery
were
his
own
ever
sence
i
saw
him
on
the
road
up
there
i
been
trackin
him
i
tell
you
wick
he
my
man
i
got
it
almost
worked
out
just
as
soon
as
these
blamed
robbers
are
moved
to
boggs
city
er
buried
i
goin
over
an
git
the
truth
out
of
barnes
i
been
huntin
him
fer
years
anderson
of
course
was
forgetting
that
barnes
had
slipped
from
his
mind
completely
until
bonner
nudged
his
memory
into
life
it
a
delicate
matter
crow
we
must
go
about
it
carefully
said
bonner
severely
if
barnes
is
really
interested
in
her
we
find
it
out
by
blundering
if
he
is
not
interested
we
ca
afford
to
drag
him
into
it
it
will
require
tact
thunderation
do
you
suppose
i
know
that
exploded
anderson
detectives
are
allers
tackin
they
got
to
y
see
ef
they
goin
to
foller
half
a
dozen
clews
at
oncet
gee
whiz
wick
leave
this
thing
to
me
i
git
at
the
bottom
of
it
inside
o
no
time
wait
a
few
days
crow
argued
bonner
playing
for
time
hurry
we
got
all
we
can
do
now
to
take
care
of
the
fellows
you
and
that
young
actor
captured
last
night
the
young
man
plan
was
to
keep
anderson
off
the
trail
entirely
and
give
the
seemingly
impossible
clew
into
the
possession
of
the
new
york
bureau
i
do
know
what
i
done
ef
it
had
been
fer
that
young
feller
said
the
marshal
he
was
right
smart
help
to
me
last
night
bonner
who
knew
the
true
story
suppressed
a
smile
and
loved
the
old
man
none
the
less
for
his
mild
deception
they
entered
the
calaboose
which
now
had
all
the
looks
and
odours
of
a
hospital
a
doctors
had
made
the
four
injured
men
as
comfortable
as
possible
they
were
stretched
on
mattresses
in
the
jail
guarded
by
a
curious
horde
of
citizens
that
gregory
whispered
anderson
as
they
neared
the
suffering
group
he
pointed
to
the
most
distant
cot
that
jest
the
way
he
swore
last
night
lie
must
shaved
in
the
automobile
last
night
though
gregory
had
merely
discarded
the
false
whiskers
he
had
worn
for
days
wait
exclaimed
bonner
stopping
short
beside
the
first
cot
he
stooped
and
peered
intently
into
the
face
of
the
wounded
bandit
by
george
what
up
as
i
live
crow
this
fellow
was
one
of
the
gang
that
abducted

swear
to
it
do
you
remember
the
one
she
tried
to
intercede
for
briggs
that
it
briggs
the
injured
man
slowly
opened
his
eyes
as
the
name
was
half
shouted
a
sickly
grin
spread
slowly
over
his
face
she
tried
to
intercede
fer
me
did
she
he
murmured
weakly
she
said
she
would
she
was
square
you
were
half
decent
to
her

bonner

you
happen
to
be

it
short
sam
said
it
was
a
kidnaping
job
an
the
wolfes

to
be
in
on
it
because
they
used
to
live
in
this
neighbourhood
done
a
lot
of
work
here
way
back
in
the
seventies
there
was
to
be
five
thousand
dollars
in
the
job
if
we
got
that
girl
safe
on
board
a
ship
bound
fer
europe
sam
told
us
that
the
guy
what
engineered
the
game
was
a
swell
party
an
a
big
boy
in
politics
finance
society
an
else
he
could
afford
to
pay
but
he
did
want
to
be
seen
in
the
job
nobody
but
sam
ever
seen
his
face
sam
used
to
be
in
politics
some
jest
before
we
left
new
york
to
come
up
here
the
swell
guy
comes
around
to
davy
with
another
guy
fer
final
orders
see
it
was
as
cold
as
h
as
the
dickens
an
the
two
of
was
all
muffled
up
so
we
get
a
pipe
at
their
mugs
one
of
was
old
over
fifty
i
guess
the
other
was
a
young
chap
i
sure
of
that
they
said
that
one
or
the
other
of
would
be
in
this
neighbourhood
when
the
job
was
pulled
off
that
one
thousand
dollars
would
be
paid
down
when
we
started
another
thousand
when
we
got
into
the
cave
and
the
rest
when
we
had
at
the
dock
in
new
york
alive
an
unhurt
see
we
was
given
to
understand
that
she
was
to
travel
all
the
rest
of
life
fer
health
i
remember
one
thing
plain
the
old
man
said
to
the
young
must
not
know
a
thing
of
this
or
it
will
ruin
everything
he
was
referrin
to
the
girl
either
there
was
another
woman
in
the
case
they
seemed
mighty
anxious
to
pull
the
job
off
without
this
woman
gettin
next
well
we
got
ready
to
start
and
the
two
parties
coughed
up
the
thousand
plunks
that
is
the
young
handed
it
over
to
sam
when
the
old
told
him
to
sam
took
three
hundred
and
the
rest
of
us
two
hundred
a
piece
when
they
were
lookin
from
the
winder
to
see
that
nobody
on
the
streets
was
watchin
the
house
i
asked
sam
if
he
knowed
either
of
them
by
name
he
swore
he
did
but
i
think
he
lied
but
jest
before
they
left
the
house
i
happened
to
look
inside
of
the
old
boy
hat
he
had
a
stiff
dicer
there
was
a
big
gilt
letter
in
the
top
of
it
what
was
that
letter
demanded
bonner
eagerly
it
was
a
b
bonner
looked
at
anderson
as
if
the
floor
were
being
drawn
from
under
his
feet
the
young
chap
said
somethin
low
to
the
old
about
takin
the
night
train
back
to
the
university
an
comin
down
again
saturday
to
the
university
which
one
did
he
mention
the
name
cried
bonner
no
that
all
he
said
good
heavens
if
it
should
be
said
bonner
as
if
to
himself
well
we
come
up
here
an
done
the
job
you
know
about
that
i
guess
sam
saw
the
young
feller
one
night
up
at
boggs
city
an
got
instructions
from
him
he
was
to
help
us
git
away
from
here
in
an
automobile
an
the
old
man
was
to
go
across
the
ocean
with
all
i
know
it
did
turn
out
their
way
that
time
but
sam
says
bound
to
happen
bonner
all
eagerness
and
excitement
quickly
looked
around
for
anderson
but
the
marshal
had
surreptitiously
left
the
room
then
going
over
to
the
door
he
called
for
anderson
crow
bud
long
was
there
anderson
left
five
minutes
ago
bonner
hurryin
like
the
dickens
too
he
said
he
gone
to
hunt
up
a
feller
named
barnes
he
told
me
to
tell
you
when
you
came
out
chapter
xxxiv
elsie
banks
returns
bonner
considerably
annoyed
and
alarmed
by
the
marshal
actions
made
every
effort
to
turn
him
back
before
he
could
ruin
everything
by
an
encounter
with
barnes
he
sent
men
on
bicycles
and
horseback
to
overtake
him
but
the
effort
was
unsuccessful
crow
had
secured
a
ride
in
an
automobile
which
had
brought
two
newspaper
correspondents
over
from
boggs
city
they
speeded
furiously
in
order
to
catch
a
train
for
new
york
but
agreed
to
drop
the
marshal
at
the
big
bridge
not
more
than
a
mile
from
judge
brewster
place
chagrined
beyond
expression
he
made
ready
to
follow
anderson
with
all
haste
in
his
own
machine
rosalie
hurriedly
perfected
preparations
to
accompany
him
she
was
rejoining
the
house
party
that
day
was
consumed
by
excitement
over
the
situation
and
just
as
eager
as
bonner
to
checkmate
the
untimely
operations
of
poor
old
anderson
crow
the
marshal
had
more
than
half
an
hour
start
of
them
bonner
was
his
own
chauffeur
and
he
was
a
reckless
one
luck
was
against
him
at
the
outset
the
vigorous
old
detective
inspired
to
real
speed
for
the
first
time
in
his
lackadaisacal
life
left
the
newspaper
men
at
the
bridge
nearly
of
an
hour
before
bonner
passed
the
same
spot
driving
furiously
up
the
hill
toward
judge
brewster
if
your
bothersome
old
daddy
gets
his
eyes
on
barnes
before
i
can
head
him
off
dearest
the
jig
will
be
up
groaned
bonner
the
first
words
he
had
spoken
in
miles
barnes
will
be
on
his
guard
and
ready
for
anything
the
old
pardon
me
for
saying
it
the
old
jay
ought
to
know
the
value
of
discretion
in
a
case
like
this
poor
old
daddy
she
sighed
compassion
in
her
heart
he
thinks
he
is
doing
it
for
the
best
wicker
i
hope
it
is
it
is
not
barnes
she
added
voicing
a
thought
which
had
been
struggling
in
her
mind
for
a
long
time
why
not
dearest
it
would
mean
one
of
two
things
either
he
does
not
want
to
recognise
me
as
his
child
or
can
not
which
is
even
worse
wicker
i
do
want
to
know
the
truth
i
am
afraid
i
am
afraid
she
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
and
there
was
positive
distress
in
her
eyes
eyes
half
covered
by
lids
tense
with
alarm
do
feel
that
way
about
it
dear
cried
he
recovering
from
his
astonishment
and
instantly
grasping
the
situation
as
it
must
have
appeared
to
her
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
not
believe
that
barnes
is
related
to
you
in
any
way
if
he
is
connected
with
the
case
at
all
it
is
in
the
capacity
of
attorney
but
he
is
supposed
to
be
an
honourable
man
true
and
i
still
believe
him
to
be
it
does
not
seem
possible
that
he
can
be
engaged
in
such
work
as
this
we
are
going
altogether
on
supposition
putting
two
and
two
together
do
you
know
and
hoping
they
will
stick
but
in
any
event
we
must
not
let
any
chance
slip
by
if
he
is
interested
we
must
bring
him
to
time
it
may
mean
the
unravelling
of
the
whole
skein
dear
do
look
so
distressed
be
brave
it
does
matter
what
we
learn
in
the
end
i
love
you
just
the
same
you
shall
be
my
wife
i
love
you
wicker
i
will
always
love
you
dear
little
sweetheart
they
whirled
up
to
the
lodge
gate
at
judge
brewster
place
at
last
the
throbbing
machine
coming
to
a
quick
stop
before
he
called
out
to
the
lodge
keeper
bonner
impulsively
drew
her
gloveless
hand
to
his
lips
nothing
can
make
any
difference
now
he
said
the
lodge
keeper
in
reply
to
bonner
eager
query
informed
them
that
barnes
had
gone
away
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
before
with
an
old
man
who
claimed
to
be
a
detective
and
who
had
placed
the
great
lawyer
under
arrest
good
lord
gasped
bonner
with
a
sinking
heart
it
an
outrage
sir
barnes
is
the
best
man
in
the
world
he
never
wronged
no
one
sir
there
an
mistake
sir
groaned
the
lodge
keeper
judge
brewster
is
in
boggs
city
and
the
man
wait
for
his
return
he
did
even
want
to
tell
barnes
what
was
charged
with
did
you
ever
hear
of
anything
so
idiotic
roared
bonner
rosalie
was
white
and
red
by
turn
what
direction
did
they
take
the
constable
told
barnes
he
to
go
to
tinkletown
with
at
once
sir
even
if
he
to
walk
all
the
way
the
old
chap
said
something
sir
about
a
man
being
there
who
could
identify
him
on
sight
barnes
to
laugh
sir
and
appeared
to
take
it
all
in
good
humour
he
said
he
go
along
of
but
he
would
walk
so
he
got
his
own
auto
out
sir
and
they
went
off
together
they
took
the
short
cut
sir
by
the
ferry
road
for
tinkletown
barnes
said
be
back
before
noon
sir
if
he
was
lynched
it
all
over
groaned
bonner
dejectedly
something
had
slipped
from
under
his
feet
and
he
was
dangling
in
space
figuratively
speaking
there
nothing
to
do
rosalie
except
to
chase
them
down
crow
has
ruined
everything
i
leave
you
at
bonner
place
with
mother
and
edith
and
i
hurry
back
to
tinkletown
the
excitement
was
too
much
for
rosalie
nerves
she
was
in
a
state
of
physical
collapse
when
he
set
her
down
at
his
uncle
summer
home
half
an
hour
later
leaving
her
to
explain
the
situation
to
the
curious
friends
he
set
speed
again
for
tinkletown
inwardly
cursing
anderson
crow
for
a
meddling
old
fool
in
the
meantime
tinkletown
was
staring
upon
a
new
sensation
the
race
between
anderson
and
bonner
was
hardly
under
way
when
down
the
main
street
of
the
town
came
a
jaded
team
and
surrey
behind
the
driver
sat
a
pretty
young
woman
with
an
eager
expression
on
her
pale
face
her
gaze
bent
intently
on
the
turn
in
the
street
which
hid
anderson
crow
home
from
view
beside
the
young
woman
lounged
another
of
her
sex
much
older
and
to
all
appearances
in
a
precarious
state
of
health
the
young
men
along
the
street
gasped
in
amazement
and
then
ventured
to
doff
their
timid
hats
to
the
young
woman
very
much
as
if
they
were
saluting
a
ghost
few
of
them
received
a
nod
of
recognition
from
elsie
banks
queen
of
all
their
hearts
roscoe
crow
bounded
out
to
the
gate
when
he
saw
who
was
in
the
carriage
first
shouting
to
his
mother
and
sisters
who
were
indoors
receiving
congratulations
and
condolences
from
their

listlessly
and
turned
to

her
hostess
indoors
with
roscoe
in
the
seat
with
the
driver
the
carriage
started
briskly
off
down
the
shady
street
headed
for
the
ferry
road
and
bonner
place
to
return
to
anderson
crow
and
his
precipitancy
just
as
the
lodge
keeper
had
said
the
marshal
afoot
and
dusty
descended
upon
barnes
without
ceremony
the
great
lawyer
was
strolling
about
the
grounds
when
his
old
enemy
arrived
he
recognised
the
odd
figure
as
it
approached
among
the
trees
hello
mr
crow
he
called
cheerily

you
going
to
arrest
me
again
he
advanced
to
shake
hands

anderson
panting

stern
i

good
to
deny
it
come
in
and
sit
down
you

tired
said
barnes
genially
regarding
his
words
as
a
jest
but
anderson
proudly
stood
his
ground
you

me

wo

no
good

years

anderson
sputtered
indignantly
driven
to
it
he
informed
john
barnes
that
he
was
charged
with
kidnaping
attempted
murder
polygamy
child
desertion
and
nearly
everything
else
under
the
sun
barnes
at
first
indignant
finally
broke
into
a
hearty
laugh
he
magnanimously
agreed
to
accompany
his
captor
to
tinkletown
not
only
that
but
he
provided
the
means
of
transportation
to
the
intense
dismay
of
the
servants
he
merrily
departed
with
crow
a
prisoner
operating
his
own
patrol
wagon
the
two
were
smoking
the
captive
best
cigars
it
mighty
nice
of
you
barnes
to
let
us
use
your
autermobile
said
anderson
benignly
puffing
away
as
they
bowled
off
through
the
dust
it
would
been
a
long
walk

speak
a
good
word

once
before

that
was
years
ago
you
were
wrong
then
and
you
are
wrong

pretty
waif

the
marshal

the
same

in
new
york
while
he

at
school
he
heard
her
story
from
mutual
friends
and
repeated
it
to
me
i
was
naturally
interested
and
questioned
you
he
said
she
was
very
pretty

the
whole
story

dear

purty
but

b

he
prepared
to
bring
the
machine
to
a
standstill
i
going
home
you

ride
back
with
me
or
get
out
and
walk

i
see
that
you
paid
fer
the
use
of
the
machine
besides
consarn
ye
you
my
prisoner
this
was
too
much
for
barnes
he
laughed
long
and
loud
and
he
did
not
turn
back
just
beyond
the
ferry
they
turned
aside
to
permit
a
carriage
to
pass
a
boy
on
the
box
with
the
driver
shouted
frantically
after
them
and
anderson
tried
to
stop
the
machine
himself
stop
her
he
cried
that
roscoe

boy

back
to
be
important
too
barnes
obligingly
turned
around
and
ran
back
to
where
the
carriage
was
standing
an
hour
later
the
automobile
rolled
into
the
driveway
at
bonner
place
and
anderson
crow
a
glorious
triumph
in
his
face
handed
miss
banks
from
the
tonneau
and
into
the
arms
of
rosalie
gray
who
at
first
had
mistaken
the
automobile
for
another
pompous
to
the
point
of
explosion
anderson
waved
his
hand
to
the
party
assembled
on
the
veranda
strolled
around
to
barnes
seat
and
acquired
a
light
for
his
cigar
with
a
nonchalance
that
almost
overcame
his
prisoner
and
then
said
apparently
to
the
whole
world
for
he
addressed
no
one
in
particular
i
knowed
i
could
solve
the
blamed
thing
if
they
jest
give
me
time
chapter
xxxv
the
story
is
told
elsie
banks
had
a
small
and
select
audience
in
bonner
room
upstairs
she
had
come
from
new
york
or
from
california
strictly
speaking
to
furnish
the
narrative
which
was
to
set
rosalie
gray
mind
at
rest
it
was
not
a
pleasant
task
it
was
not
an
easy
sacrifice
for
this
spirited
girl
who
had
known
luxury
all
her
life
her
spellbound
hearers
were
bonner
and
edith
wicker
bonner
anderson
crow
rosalie
and
john
barnes
who
far
from
being
a
captive
of
the
law
was
now
miss
gray
attorney
retained
some
hours
before
by
his
former
captor
i
discharge
you
sir
anderson
had
said
after
hearing
miss
statement
in
the
roadway
you
are
no
longer
a
prisoner

you
anything
to
say
sir
nothing
crow
except
to
offer
my
legal
services
to
you
and
your
ward
in
this
extraordinary
matter
put
the
matter
in
my
hands
sir
and
she
shall
soon
come
into
her
own
thanks
to
this
young
lady
i
may
add
that
as
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
soliciting
clients
it
is
not
my
intention
in
this
instance
to
exact
a
fee
from
your
ward
my
services
are
quite
free
given
in
return
crow
for
the
magnanimous
way
in
which
you
have
taken
me
into
your
confidence
ever
since
i
have
known
you
it
is
an
honour
to
have
been
arrested
by
you
truthfully
it
is
no
disgrace
in
the
privacy
of
bonner
elsie
banks
and
bitter
told
the
story
of
her
life
i
can
not
tell
it
as
she
did
for
she
was
able
to
bring
tears
to
the
eyes
of
her
listeners
it
is
only
for
me
to
relate
the
bare
facts
putting
them
into
her
words
as
closely
as
possible
rosalie
gray
faint
with
astonishment
and
incredulity
a
lump
in
her
throat
that
would
not
go
down
and
tears
in
her
eyes
leaned
back
in
an
and
watched
her
unhappy
friend
i
shall
provide
barnes
with
proof
of
everything
i
say
said
miss
banks
there
can
be
no
difficulty
rosalie
dear
in
confirming
all
that
i
have
to
tell
if
you
will
permit
me
to
relate
the
story
without
interruption
and
afterward
let
me
go
my
way
without
either
pity
or
contempt
i
shall
be
oh
so
grateful
to
you
all
especially
to
you
dear
rosalie
believe
me
i
love
you
with
my
whole
soul
i
have
come
to
you
voluntarily
and
my
mother
who
is
in
tinkletown
in
resigning
herself
to
the
calls
of
conscience
is
now
happier
than
she
has
ever
been
before
a
more
powerful
influence
than
her
own
will
or
her
own
honour
an
influence
that
was
evil
to
the
core
inspired
her
to
countenance
this
awful
wrong
it
also
checkmated
every
good
impulse
she
may
have
had
to
undo
it
in
after
years
that
influence
came
from
oswald
banks
a
base
monster
to
whom
my
mother
was
married
when
i
was
a
year
old
my
mother
was
the
daughter
of
lord
abbott
brace
but
married
my
own
father
george
stuart
who
was
a
brilliant
but
radical
newspaper
writer
in
london
against
her
father
wish
for
this
he
cast
her
off
and
disinherited
her
grandfather
hated
him
and
his
views
and
he
could
not
forgive
my
mother
even
after
my
father
died
which
was
two
years
after
their
marriage
lord
richard
brace
my
mother
only
brother
married
the
daughter
of
the
duchess
of
b
you
rosalie
are
lady
rosalie
brace
of
brace
hall
w
shire
england
the
true
granddaughter
of
general
lord
abbott
brace
one
of
the
noblest
and
richest
men
of
his
day
please
let
me
go
on
i
can
not
endure
the
interruptions
the
absolute
unalterable
proof
of
what
i
say
shall
be
established
through
the
confession
of
my
own
mother
in
whose
possession
lies
every
document
necessary
to
give
back
to
you
that
which
she
would
have
given
to
me
your
mother
died
a
few
weeks
after
you
were
born
and
sir
richard
who
loved
my
mother
in
the
face
of
his
father
displeasure
placed
you
in
her
care
while
he
rushed
off
to
find
solace
in
egypt
it
is
said
that
he
hated
you
because
you
were
the
cause
of
her
death
on
the
day
after
your
birth
old
lord
brace
changed
his
will
and
bequeathed
a
vast
amount
of
unentailed
property
to
you
to
be
held
in
trust
by
your
father
until
you
were
years
of
age
i
was
almost
two
years
old
at
the
time
and
the
old
man
unexpectedly
compassionate
inserted
a
provision
which
in
the
event
that
you
were
to
die
before
that
time
gave
all
this
money
to
me
on
my
birthday
the
interest
on
this
money
amounting
to
five
thousand
pounds
annually
was
to
go
to
you
regularly
in
one
case
or
to
me
in
the
other
oswald
banks
was
an
american
whom
my
mother
had
met
in
london
several
years
prior
to
her
first
marriage
he
was
the
london
representative
of
a
big
pennsylvania
manufacturing
concern
he
was
ambitious
unscrupulous
and
clever
beyond
conception
he
still
is
all
of
these
and
more
for
he
is
now
a
coward
well
it
was
he
who
concocted
the
diabolical
scheme
to
one
day
get
possession
of
your
inheritance
he
coerced
my
poor
mother
into
acquiescense
and
she
became
his
wretched
tool
instead
of
an
honoured
wife
and
helpmate
one
night
when
you
were
three
weeks
old
the
house
in
which
we
lived
was
burned
to
the
ground
the
inmates
narrowly
escaping
so
narrow
was
the
escape
in
fact
that
you
were
said
to
have
been
left
behind
in
the
confusion
and
the
world
was
told
the
next
day
that
the
granddaughter
of
lord
brace
had
been
destroyed
by
the
flames
the
truth
however
was
not
told
my
stepfather
did
not
dare
to
go
so
far
as
to
kill
you
it
was
he
who
caused
the
fire
but
he
had
you
removed
to
a
small
hotel
in
another
part
of
the
city
some
hours
earlier
secretly
of
course
but
in
charge
of
a
trusted
maid
my
mother
was
responsible
for
this
she
would
not
listen
to
his
awful
plan
to
leave
you
in
the
house
but
you
might
just
as
well
have
died
no
one
was
the
wiser
and
you
were
given
up
as
lost
a
week
later
my
mother
and
banks
started
for
america
you
and
i
were
with
them
but
you
went
as
the
daughter
of
a
ellen
hayes
this
is
the
story
as
my
mother
has
told
it
to
me
after
all
these
years
my
stepfather
plan
of
course
was
to
place
you
where
you
could
never
be
found
and
then
to
see
to
it
that
our
grandfather
did
not
succeed
in
changing
his
will
moreover
he
was
bound
and
determined
that
he
himself
should
be
named
as
trustee
when
the
fortune
came
over
at
lord
death
that
part
of
it
turned
out
precisely
as
he
had
calculated
let
me
go
on
a
few
months
in
advance
of
my
story
lord
brace
died
and
the
will
was
properly
probated
and
the
provisions
carried
out
brace
hall
and
the
estates
went
to
your
father
and
the
bequest
came
to
me
for
you
were
considered
dead
my
stepfather
was
made
trustee
he
gave
bond
in
england
and
america
i
believe
in
any
event
the
fortune
was
to
be
mine
when
i
reached
the
age
of
but
each
year
the
income
nearly
thousand
dollars
was
to
be
paid
to
my
stepfather
as
trustee
to
be
safely
invested
by
him
my
mother
name
was
not
mentioned
in
the
document
except
once
to
identify
me
as
the
beneficiary
i
can
only
add
to
this
phase
of
the
hateful
conspiracy
that
for
nineteen
years
my
stepfather
received
this
income
and
that
he
used
it
to
establish
his
own
fortune
by
investing
what
was
supposed
to
be
my
money
he
has
won
his
own
way
to
wealth
banks
decided
that
the
operations
were
safest
from
this
side
of
the
atlantic
he
and
my
mother
took
up
their
residence
in
new
york
and
it
has
been
their
home
ever
since
he
spent
the
first
half
year
after
your
suspected
death
in
london
solely
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
himself
in
lord
brace
favour
within
a
year
after
the
death
of
lord
brace
your
father
was
killed
by
a
poacher
on
the
estate
he
had
but
lately
returned
from
egypt
and
was
in
full
control
of
the
lands
and
property
attached
to
brace
hall
if
my
stepfather
had
designs
upon
brace
hall
they
failed
for
the
lands
and
the
title
went
at
once
to
your
father
cousin
sir
harry
brace
the
present
lord
so
much
for
the
conditions
in
england
then
and
now
i
now
return
to
that
part
of
the
story
which
most
interests
and
concerns
you
my
poor
mother
was
compelled
within
a
fortnight
after
we
landed
in
new
york
to
give
up
the
dangerous
infant
who
was
always
to
hang
like
a
cloud
between
fortune
and
honour
the
was
paid
well
for
her
silence
by
the
way
she
died
mysteriously
soon
after
coming
to
america
but
not
before
giving
to
my
mother
a
signed
paper
setting
forth
clearly
every
detail
in
so
far
as
it
bore
upon
her
connection
with
the
hateful
transaction
conscience
was
forever
at
work
in
my
mother
heart
honour
was
constantly
struggling
to
the
surface
only
to
be
held
back
by
fear
of
and
loyalty
to
the
man
she
loved
it
was
decided
that
the
most
humane
way
to
put
you
out
of
existence
was
to
leave
you
on
the
doorstep
of
some
kindly
disposed
person
far
from
new
york
my
stepfather
and
my
mother
deliberately
set
forth
on
this
mission
of
mercy
they
came
north
and
by
chance
fell
in
with
a
resident
of
boggs
city
while
in
the
station
at
albany
they
were
debating
which
way
to
turn
for
the
next
step
my
mother
was
firm
in
the
resolve
that
you
should
be
left
in
the
care
of
honest
reliable
people
who
would
not
abuse
the
trust
she
was
to
impose
the
boggs
city
man
said
he
had
been
in
albany
to
see
about
a
bill
in
the
legislature
which
was
to
provide
for
the
erection
of
a
monument
in
tinkletown
where
a
revolutionary
battle
had
been
fought
it
was
he
who
spoke
of
anderson
crow
and
it
was
his
stories
of
your
goodness
and
generosity
crow
that
caused
them
to
select
you
as
the
man
who
was
to
have
rosalie
and
with
her
the
sum
of
one
thousand
dollars
a
year
for
your
trouble
and
her
needs
my
mother
description
of
that
stormy
night
in
february
more
than
years
ago
is
the
most
pitiful
thing
i
have
ever
listened
to
together
they
made
their
way
to
tinkletown
hiring
a
vehicle
in
boggs
city
for
the
purpose
banks
left
the
basket
on
your
porch
while
mother
stood
far
down
the
street
and
waited
for
him
half
frozen
and
heartsick
then
they
hurried
out
of
town
and
were
soon
safely
on
their
way
to
new
york
it
was
while
my
stepfather
was
in
london
later
on
that
mother
came
up
to
see
rosalie
and
make
that
memorable
first
payment
to
crow
how
it
went
on
for
years
you
all
know
it
was
my
stepfather
cleverness
that
made
it
so
impossible
to
learn
the
source
from
which
the
mysterious
money
came
we
travelled
constantly
always
finding
new
places
of
interest
in
which
my
mother
conscience
could
be
eased
by
contact
with
beauty
and
excitement
gradually
she
became
hardened
to
the
conditions
for
after
all
was
it
not
her
own
child
who
was
to
be
enriched
by
the
theft
and
the
deception
banks
constantly
forced
that
fact
in
upon
her
and
her
vanity
through
it
all
however
you
were
never
neglected
nor
forgotten
my
mother
had
your
welfare
always
in
mind
it
was
she
who
saw
that
you
and
i
were
placed
at
the
same
school
in
new
york
and
it
was
she
who
saw
that
your
training
in
a
way
was
as
good
as
it
could
possibly
be
without
exciting
risk
of
course
i
knew
nothing
of
all
this
i
was
rolling
in
wealth
and
luxury
but
not
in
happiness
instinctively
i
loathed
my
stepfather
he
was
hard
cruel
unreasonable
it
was
because
of
him
that
i
left
school
and
afterward
sought
to
earn
my
own
living
you
know
rosalie
how
tom
reddon
came
into
my
life
he
was
the
son
of
william
reddon
my
stepfather
business
partner
who
had
charge
of
the
western
branch
of
the
concern
in
chicago
we
lived
in
chicago
for
several
years
establishing
the
business
banks
was
until
recently
president
of
the
banks
reddon
iron
works
last
year
you
doubtless
know
the
plant
was
sold
to
the
great
combine
and
the
old
company
passed
out
of
existence
this
act
was
the
result
of
a
demand
from
england
that
the
trust
under
which
he
served
be
closed
and
struck
from
the
records
it
was
his
plan
to
settle
the
matter
turn
the
inheritance
over
to
me
according
to
law
and
then
impose
upon
my
inexperience
for
all
time
to
come
the
money
while
mine
literally
was
to
be
his
in
point
of
possession
but
he
had
reckoned
without
the
son
of
his
partner
tom
reddon
in
some
way
learned
the
secret
and
he
was
compelled
to
admit
the
young
man
into
all
of
his
plans
this
came
about
some
three
years
ago
while
i
was
in
school
i
had
known
tom
reddon
in
chicago
he
won
my
love
i
can
not
deny
it
although
i
despise
him
more
deeply
than
i
ever
expect
to
hate
again
he
was
even
more
despicable
than
my
stepfather
without
the
faintest
touch
of
pity
he
set
about
to
obliterate
every
chance
rosalie
could
have
had
for
restitution
time
began
to
prove
to
me
that
he
was
not
the
man
i
thought
him
to
be
his
nature
revealed
itself
and
i
found
i
could
not
marry
him
besides
my
mother
was
beginning
to
repent
she
awoke
from
her
stupor
of
indifference
and
strove
in
every
way
to
circumvent
the
plot
of
the
two
conspirators
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
the
strain
told
on
her
at
last
and
we
went
to
california
soon
after
my
ridiculous
flight
from
tinkletown
last
winter
it
was
not
until
after
that
adventure
that
i
began
to
see
deep
into
the
wretched
soul
of
tom
reddon
then
came
the
most
villainous
part
of
the
whole
conspiracy
reddon
knowing
full
well
that
exposure
was
possible
at
any
time
urged
my
stepfather
to
have
you
kidnaped
and
hurried
off
to
some
part
of
the
world
where
you
could
never
be
found
even
reddon
did
not
have
the
courage
to
kill
you
neither
had
the
heart
to
commit
actual
murder
it
was
while
we
were
at
colonel
randall
place
that
the
abduction
took
place
you
remember
banks
and
tom
reddon
had
engaged
their
men
in
new
york
these
desperadoes
came
to
boggs
city
while
tom
was
here
to
watch
their
operations
all
the
time
crow
was
chasing
us
down
reddon
was
laughing
in
his
sleeve
for
he
knew
what
was
to
happen
during
the
marshal
absence
you
know
how
successfully
he
managed
the
job
it
was
my
stepfather
fault
that
it
did
not
succeed
my
mother
down
in
new
york
driven
to
the
last
extreme
had
finally
turned
on
him
and
demanded
that
he
make
restitution
to
rosalie
gray
as
we
had
come
to
know
her
of
course
there
was
a
scene
and
almost
a
catastrophe
he
was
so
worried
over
the
position
she
was
taking
that
he
failed
to
carry
out
his
part
of
the
plans
which
were
to
banish
rosalie
forever
from
this
country
you
were
to
have
been
taken
to
paris
dear
and
kept
forever
in
one
of
those
awful
sanitoriums
they
are
worse
than
the
grave
in
the
meantime
the
delay
gave
bonner
a
chance
to
rescue
you
from
the
kidnapers
shortly
after
reaching
new
york
i
quarrelled
with
thomas
reddon
and
my
mother
and
i
fled
to
california
he
followed
us
and
sought
a
reconciliation
i
loathed
him
so
much
by
this
time
that
i
appealed
to
my
mother
it
was
then
that
she
told
me
this
miserable
story
and
that
is
why
we
are
in
tinkletown
we
learned
in
some
way
of
the
plot
to
kidnap
you
and
to
place
you
where
you
could
not
be
found
the
inhuman
scheme
of
my
stepfather
and
his
adviser
was
to
have
my
mother
declared
insane
and
confined
in
an
asylum
where
her
truthful
utterances
could
never
be
heard
by
the
world
or
if
they
were
as
the
ravings
of
a
mad
woman
the
day
that
we
reached
new
york
my
mother
the
documents
and
every
particle
of
proof
in
her
possession
in
the
hands
of
the
british
consul
the
story
was
told
to
him
and
also
to
certain
attorneys
a
member
of
his
firm
visited
my
stepfather
and
confronted
him
with
the
charges
that
very
night
banks
disappeared
leaving
behind
him
a
note
in
which
he
said
we
should
never
see
his
face
again
tom
reddon
has
gone
to
europe
my
mother
and
i
expect
to
sail
this
week
for
england
and
i
have
come
to
ask
rosalie
to
accompany
us
i
want
her
to
stand
at
last
on
the
soil
which
knows
her
to
be
rosalie
brace
the
fortune
which
was
mine
last
week
is
hers
we
are
not
poor
rosalie
dear
but
we
are
not
as
rich
as
we
were
when
we
had
all
that
belonged
to
you
chapter

anderson
crow
resignation
some
days
later
anderson
crow
returned
to
tinkletown
from
new
york
where
he
had
seen
rosalie
bonner
and
her
husband
off
for
england
accompanied
by
banks
and
elsie
who
had
taken
passage
on
the
same
steamer
he
was
attired
in
a
suit
of
blue
serge
a
panama
hat
and
shoes
which
hurt
his
feet
moreover
he
carried
a
new
walking
stick
with
a
great
gold
head
and
there
was
a
huge
pearl
in
his
necktie
besides
all
this
his
hair
and
beard
had
been
trimmed
to
perfection
by
a
holland
house
barber
every
morning
his
wife
was
obliged
to
run
a
flatiron
over
his
trousers
to
perpetuate
the
crease
altogether
anderson
was
a
revelation
not
only
to
his
family
and
to
the
town
at
large
but
to
himself
as
well
he
fairly
staggered
every
time
he
got
a
glimpse
of
himself
in
the
shop
windows
all
day
long
he
strolled
about
the
street
from
store
to
store
or
leaned
imposingly
against
every
post
that
presented
itself
conveniently
naturally
he
was
the
talk
of
the
town
ejaculated
alf
reesling

he
at
that
moment
anderson
approached
the
group
in
front
of
lamson
store
he
walked
with
a
stateliness
that
seemed
to
signify
pain
in
his
lower
extremities
more
than
it
did
dignity
higher
up
how
fer
out
do
you
reckon
they

this
time
blootch

asked
earnestly

his
watch
well
that

these
years
to
find
out
who
her
parents

course
i
knowed
they
were
foreigners
all
the
time
but
rosalie
never

so
you
see
how
i
was
threw
off
the
track
she
talked
jest
as
good
american
as
we
do
i
was
mighty
glad
when
i
finally
run
miss
banks
to
earth
the
crowd
was
in
no
position
to
argue
the
point
with
him
that
miss
banks
is
a
fine
girl
boys
she
done
the
right
thing
an
so
did
my
rosalie
i
mean
lady

she
made
elsie
keep
some
of
the
money
barnes

goin
to

next
week
to
help

the
matter
for
lady
rosalie
he
says
she
got
nearly
a
million
dollars
tied
up
it
easy
sailin
though
banks
says
so
did
you
hear
what
rosalie
said
when
she
got
convinced
about
bein
an
english
lady
no
what
did
she
say
she
jest
stuck
up
that
derned
little
nose
o
hern
an
said

american
as
long
as
i
live
hooray
shouted
alf
reesling
throwing
isaac
porter
new
hat
into
the
air
the
crowd
joined
in
the
cheering
did
i
ever
tell
you
how
i
knowed
all
along
that
it
was
a
man
who
left
rosalie
on
the
porch
asked
anderson
why
you
allus
told
me
it
was
a
woman
said
alf
you
accused
me
of
bein
her
shucks
woman
nothin
i
knowed
it
was
a
man
here
somethin
you
do
know
alf
i
sized
up
the
on
my
front
steps
jest
after
she
i
mean
he
dropped
the
basket
the
toes
turned
outward
plain
as
day
right
there
in
the
snow
he
paused
to
let
the
statement
settle
in
their
puzzled
brains
do
you
know
that
one
hunderd
percent
of
the
women
turn
their
toes
in
when
they
go
upstairs
to
keep
from
into
their
skirts
thunder
you
oughter
of
thought
of
that
too
some
one
had
posted
anderson
on
this
peculiarly
feminine
trait
and
he
was
making
the
best
of
it
incidentally
it
may
be
said
that
every
man
in
tinkletown
took
personal
observations
in
order
to
satisfy
himself
any
one
seen
pastor
macfarlane
went
on
anderson
wick
bonner
give
me
a
hunderd
dollar
bill
to
give
him
fer
performin
the
ceremony
up
to
our
house
that
night
ed
higgins
i
not
goin
showin
that
bill
to
people
if
robbers
got
onto
the
fact
i
have
it
they
probably
try
to
steal
it
i
do
keer
if
you
ai
seen
that
much
money
in
one
piece
that
none
of
my
lookout
say
are
you
comin
to
the
town
meetin
they
were
all
at
the
meeting
of
the
town
board
that
night
it
was
held
as
usual
in
odd
fellows
hall
above
peterson
store
and
there
was
not
so
much
as
standing
room
in
the
place
when
the
clerk
read
the
minutes
of
the
last
meeting
word
had
gone
forth
that
something
unusual
was
to
happen
it
was
not
idle
rumour
for
soon
after
the
session
began
anderson
crow
arose
to
address
the
board
gentlemen
he
said
his
voice
trembling
with
emotion
i
have
come
before
you
as
i
notified
you
i
would
i
hereby
tender
my
resignation
as
marshal
of
tinkletown
street
commissioner
and
chief
of
the
fire
department
an
any
other
job
i
may
have
that
has
slipped
my
mind
i
now
suggest
that
you
ed
higgins
in
my
place
he
has
wanted
the
job
fer
some
time
an
says
it
wo
interfere
with
his
business
any
more
than
it
did
with
mine
i
have
worked
hard
all
these
years
an
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
have
a
rest
besides
it
has
got
to
be
so
that
thieves
an
other
criminals
wo
visit
tinkletown
on
account
o
me
i
think
the
town
is
bein
held
back
considerable
in
that
way
what
the
use
havin
a
marshal
an
a
jail
ef
nobody
comes
here
to
commit
crimes
they
have
to
commit
in
new
york
city
er
chicago
nowadays
jest
because
it
safer
there
than
it
is
here
look
at
this
last
case
i
had
was
that
arranged
in
new
york
well
it
should
be
that
way
even
the
train
robbers
put
up
their
job
in
new
york
i
feel
that
the
best
interests
of
the
town
would
be
served
ef
i
resign
an
give
the
criminals
a
chance
you
all
know
ed
higgins
he
will
ketch
if
anybody
kin
i
move
that
he
be
the
motion
prevailed
as
did
the
vote
of
thanks
which
was
vociferously
called
for
in
behalf
of
anderson
crow
you
honour
me
said
the
when
the
ayes
died
away
i
promise
to
help
marshal
higgins
in
ever
way
possible
i
tell
him
jest
what
to
do
in
everything
i
wish
to
say
that
i
am
not
goin
out
of
the
detective
business
however
i
goin
to
open
an
agency
of
my
own
here
all
sorts
of
detective
business
will
be
done
at
reasonable
prices
i
had
these
cards
printed
at
the
office
an
squires
is
goin
to
run
an
ad
fer
me
fer
a
year
in
the
paper
he
proudly
handed
a
card
to
the
president
of
the
board
and
then
told
the
crowd
that
each
person
present
could
have
one
by
applying
to
his
son
roscoe
who
would
be
waiting
in
the
hallway
after
the
meeting
the
card
read
anderson
crow
detective
all
kinds
of
cases
taken
and
satisfaction
guaranteed
berth
mysteries
a
specialty
bonner
upon
hearing
of
his
resignation
the
next
day
just
as
she
was
leaving
for
boston
drily
remarked
to
the
congressman
i
still
maintain
that
anderson
crow
is
utterly
impossible
no
doubt
the
entire
world
aside
from
the
village
of
tinkletown
agrees
with
her
in
that
opinion
