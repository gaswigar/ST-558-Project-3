phaedrus
by
plato
translated
by
benjamin
jowett
introduction
the
phaedrus
is
closely
connected
with
the
symposium
and
may
be
regarded
either
as
introducing
or
following
it
the
two
dialogues
together
contain
the
whole
philosophy
of
plato
on
the
nature
of
love
which
in
the
republic
and
in
the
later
writings
of
plato
is
only
introduced
playfully
or
as
a
figure
of
speech
but
in
the
phaedrus
and
symposium
love
and
philosophy
join
hands
and
one
is
an
aspect
of
the
other
the
spiritual
and
emotional
part
is
elevated
into
the
ideal
to
which
in
the
symposium
mankind
are
described
as
looking
forward
and
which
in
the
phaedrus
as
well
as
in
the
phaedo
they
are
seeking
to
recover
from
a
former
state
of
existence
whether
the
subject
of
the
dialogue
is
love
or
rhetoric
or
the
union
of
the
two
or
the
relation
of
philosophy
to
love
and
to
art
in
general
and
to
the
human
soul
will
be
hereafter
considered
and
perhaps
we
may
arrive
at
some
conclusion
such
as
the
following
that
the
dialogue
is
not
strictly
confined
to
a
single
subject
but
passes
from
one
to
another
with
the
natural
freedom
of
conversation
phaedrus
has
been
spending
the
morning
with
lysias
the
celebrated
rhetorician
and
is
going
to
refresh
himself
by
taking
a
walk
outside
the
wall
when
he
is
met
by
socrates
who
professes
that
he
will
not
leave
him
until
he
has
delivered
up
the
speech
with
which
lysias
has
regaled
him
and
which
he
is
carrying
about
in
his
mind
or
more
probably
in
a
book
hidden
under
his
cloak
and
is
intending
to
study
as
he
walks
the
imputation
is
not
denied
and
the
two
agree
to
direct
their
steps
out
of
the
public
way
along
the
stream
of
the
ilissus
towards
a
which
is
seen
in
the
distance
there
lying
down
amidst
pleasant
sounds
and
scents
they
will
read
the
speech
of
lysias
the
country
is
a
novelty
to
socrates
who
never
goes
out
of
the
town
and
hence
he
is
full
of
admiration
for
the
beauties
of
nature
which
he
seems
to
be
drinking
in
for
the
first
time
as
they
are
on
their
way
phaedrus
asks
the
opinion
of
socrates
respecting
the
local
tradition
of
boreas
and
oreithyia
socrates
after
a
satirical
allusion
to
the
of
his
day
replies
that
he
has
no
time
for
these
interpretations
of
mythology
and
he
pities
anyone
who
has
when
you
once
begin
there
is
no
end
of
them
and
they
spring
from
an
uncritical
philosophy
after
all
proper
study
of
mankind
is
man
and
he
is
a
far
more
complex
and
wonderful
being
than
the
serpent
typho
socrates
as
yet
does
not
know
himself
and
why
should
he
care
to
know
about
unearthly
monsters
engaged
in
such
conversation
they
arrive
at
the
when
they
have
found
a
convenient
phaedrus
pulls
out
the
speech
and
reads
the
speech
consists
of
a
foolish
paradox
which
is
to
the
effect
that
the
ought
to
be
accepted
rather
than
the
lover
because
he
is
more
rational
more
agreeable
more
enduring
less
suspicious
less
hurtful
less
boastful
less
engrossing
and
because
there
are
more
of
them
and
for
a
great
many
other
reasons
which
are
equally
unmeaning
phaedrus
is
captivated
with
the
beauty
of
the
periods
and
wants
to
make
socrates
say
that
nothing
was
or
ever
could
be
written
better
socrates
does
not
think
much
of
the
matter
but
then
he
has
only
attended
to
the
form
and
in
that
he
has
detected
several
repetitions
and
other
marks
of
haste
he
can
not
agree
with
phaedrus
in
the
extreme
value
which
he
sets
upon
this
performance
because
he
is
afraid
of
doing
injustice
to
anacreon
and
sappho
and
other
great
writers
and
is
almost
inclined
to
think
that
he
himself
or
rather
some
power
residing
within
him
could
make
a
speech
better
than
that
of
lysias
on
the
same
theme
and
also
different
from
his
if
he
may
be
allowed
the
use
of
a
few
commonplaces
which
all
speakers
must
equally
employ
phaedrus
is
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
having
another
speech
and
promises
that
he
will
set
up
a
golden
statue
of
socrates
at
delphi
if
he
keeps
his
word
some
raillery
ensues
and
at
length
socrates
conquered
by
the
threat
that
he
shall
never
again
hear
a
speech
of
lysias
unless
he
fulfils
his
promise
veils
his
face
and
begins
first
invoking
the
muses
and
assuming
ironically
the
person
of
the
who
is
a
lover
all
the
same
he
will
enquire
into
the
nature
and
power
of
love
for
this
is
a
necessary
preliminary
to
the
other
question
how
is
the
to
be
distinguished
from
the
lover
in
all
of
us
there
are
two
principles
a
better
and
a
worse
reason
and
desire
which
are
generally
at
war
with
one
another
and
the
victory
of
the
rational
is
called
temperance
and
the
victory
of
the
irrational
intemperance
or
excess
the
latter
takes
many
forms
and
has
many
bad
names
gluttony
drunkenness
and
the
like
but
of
all
the
irrational
desires
or
excesses
the
greatest
is
that
which
is
led
away
by
desires
of
a
kindred
nature
to
the
enjoyment
of
personal
beauty
and
this
is
the
master
power
of
love
here
socrates
fancies
that
he
detects
in
himself
an
unusual
flow
of
eloquence
this
gift
he
can
only
attribute
to
the
inspiration
of
the
place
which
appears
to
be
dedicated
to
the
nymphs
starting
again
from
the
philosophical
basis
which
has
been
laid
down
he
proceeds
to
show
how
many
advantages
the
has
over
the
lover
the
one
encourages
softness
and
effeminacy
and
exclusiveness
he
can
not
endure
any
superiority
in
his
beloved
he
will
train
him
in
luxury
he
will
keep
him
out
of
society
he
will
deprive
him
of
parents
friends
money
knowledge
and
of
every
other
good
that
he
may
have
him
all
to
himself
then
again
his
ways
are
not
ways
of
pleasantness
he
is
mighty
disagreeable
age
and
youth
can
not
live
together
at
every
hour
of
the
night
and
day
he
is
intruding
upon
him
there
is
the
same
old
withered
face
and
the
remainder
to
match
and
he
is
always
repeating
in
season
or
out
of
season
the
praises
or
dispraises
of
his
beloved
which
are
bad
enough
when
he
is
sober
and
published
all
over
the
world
when
he
is
drunk
at
length
his
love
ceases
he
is
converted
into
an
enemy
and
the
spectacle
may
be
seen
of
the
lover
running
away
from
the
beloved
who
pursues
him
with
vain
reproaches
and
demands
his
reward
which
the
other
refuses
to
pay
too
late
the
beloved
learns
after
all
his
pains
and
disagreeables
that
wolves
love
lambs
so
lovers
love
their
loves
compare
char
here
is
the
end
the
or
part
of
the
speech
had
better
be
understood
for
if
in
the
censure
of
the
lover
socrates
has
broken
out
in
verse
what
will
he
not
do
in
his
praise
of
the
he
has
said
his
say
and
is
preparing
to
go
away
phaedrus
begs
him
to
remain
at
any
rate
until
the
heat
of
noon
has
passed
he
would
like
to
have
a
little
more
conversation
before
they
go
socrates
who
has
risen
recognizes
the
oracular
sign
which
forbids
him
to
depart
until
he
has
done
penance
his
conscious
has
been
awakened
and
like
stesichorus
when
he
had
reviled
the
lovely
helen
he
will
sing
a
palinode
for
having
blasphemed
the
majesty
of
love
his
palinode
takes
the
form
of
a
myth
socrates
begins
his
tale
with
a
glorification
of
madness
which
he
divides
into
four
kinds
first
there
is
the
art
of
divination
or
prophecy
this
in
a
vein
similar
to
that
pervading
the
cratylus
and
io
he
connects
with
madness
by
an
etymological
explanation
mantike
manike
compare
oionoistike
oionistike
all
one
reckoning
save
the
phrase
is
a
little
variations
secondly
there
is
the
art
of
purification
by
mysteries
thirdly
poetry
or
the
inspiration
of
the
muses
compare
ion
without
which
no
man
can
enter
their
temple
all
this
shows
that
madness
is
one
of
heaven
blessings
and
may
sometimes
be
a
great
deal
better
than
sense
there
is
also
a
fourth
kind
of
madness
that
of
love
which
can
not
be
explained
without
enquiring
into
the
nature
of
the
soul
all
soul
is
immortal
for
she
is
the
source
of
all
motion
both
in
herself
and
in
others
her
form
may
be
described
in
a
figure
as
a
composite
nature
made
up
of
a
charioteer
and
a
pair
of
winged
steeds
the
steeds
of
the
gods
are
immortal
but
ours
are
one
mortal
and
the
other
immortal
the
immortal
soul
soars
upwards
into
the
heavens
but
the
mortal
drops
her
plumes
and
settles
upon
the
earth
now
the
use
of
the
wing
is
to
rise
and
carry
the
downward
element
into
the
upper
world
there
to
behold
beauty
wisdom
goodness
and
the
other
things
of
god
by
which
the
soul
is
nourished
on
a
certain
day
zeus
the
lord
of
heaven
goes
forth
in
a
winged
chariot
and
an
array
of
gods
and
and
of
human
souls
in
their
train
follows
him
there
are
glorious
and
blessed
sights
in
the
interior
of
heaven
and
he
who
will
may
freely
behold
them
the
great
vision
of
all
is
seen
at
the
feast
of
the
gods
when
they
ascend
the
heights
of
the
empyrean
all
but
hestia
who
is
left
at
home
to
keep
house
the
chariots
of
the
gods
glide
readily
upwards
and
stand
upon
the
outside
the
revolution
of
the
spheres
carries
them
round
and
they
have
a
vision
of
the
world
beyond
but
the
others
labour
in
vain
for
the
mortal
steed
if
he
has
not
been
properly
trained
keeps
them
down
and
sinks
them
towards
the
earth
of
the
world
which
is
beyond
the
heavens
who
can
tell
there
is
an
essence
formless
colourless
intangible
perceived
by
the
mind
only
dwelling
in
the
region
of
true
knowledge
the
divine
mind
in
her
revolution
enjoys
this
fair
prospect
and
beholds
justice
temperance
and
knowledge
in
their
everlasting
essence
when
fulfilled
with
the
sight
of
them
she
returns
home
and
the
charioteer
puts
up
the
horses
in
their
stable
and
gives
them
ambrosia
to
eat
and
nectar
to
drink
this
is
the
life
of
the
gods
the
human
soul
tries
to
reach
the
same
heights
but
hardly
succeeds
and
sometimes
the
head
of
the
charioteer
rises
above
and
sometimes
sinks
below
the
fair
vision
and
he
is
at
last
obliged
after
much
contention
to
turn
away
and
leave
the
plain
of
truth
but
if
the
soul
has
followed
in
the
train
of
her
god
and
once
beheld
truth
she
is
preserved
from
harm
and
is
carried
round
in
the
next
revolution
of
the
spheres
and
if
always
following
and
always
seeing
the
truth
is
then
for
ever
unharmed
if
however
she
drops
her
wings
and
falls
to
the
earth
then
she
takes
the
form
of
man
and
the
soul
which
has
seen
most
of
the
truth
passes
into
a
philosopher
or
lover
that
which
has
seen
truth
in
the
second
degree
into
a
king
or
warrior
the
third
into
a
householder
or
the
fourth
into
a
gymnast
the
fifth
into
a
prophet
or
mystic
the
sixth
into
a
poet
or
imitator
the
seventh
into
a
husbandman
or
craftsman
the
eighth
into
a
sophist
or
demagogue
the
ninth
into
a
tyrant
all
these
are
states
of
probation
wherein
he
who
lives
righteously
is
improved
and
he
who
lives
unrighteously
deteriorates
after
death
comes
the
judgment
the
bad
depart
to
houses
of
correction
under
the
earth
the
good
to
places
of
joy
in
heaven
when
a
thousand
years
have
elapsed
the
souls
meet
together
and
choose
the
lives
which
they
will
lead
for
another
period
of
existence
the
soul
which
three
times
in
succession
has
chosen
the
life
of
a
philosopher
or
of
a
lover
who
is
not
without
philosophy
receives
her
wings
at
the
close
of
the
third
millennium
the
remainder
have
to
complete
a
cycle
of
ten
thousand
years
before
their
wings
are
restored
to
them
each
time
there
is
full
liberty
of
choice
the
soul
of
a
man
may
descend
into
a
beast
and
return
again
into
the
form
of
man
but
the
form
of
man
will
only
be
taken
by
the
soul
which
has
once
seen
truth
and
acquired
some
conception
of
the
universal
this
is
the
recollection
of
the
knowledge
which
she
attained
when
in
the
company
of
the
gods
and
men
in
general
recall
only
with
difficulty
the
things
of
another
world
but
the
mind
of
the
philosopher
has
a
better
remembrance
of
them
for
when
he
beholds
the
visible
beauty
of
earth
his
enraptured
soul
passes
in
thought
to
those
glorious
sights
of
justice
and
wisdom
and
temperance
and
truth
which
she
once
gazed
upon
in
heaven
then
she
celebrated
holy
mysteries
and
beheld
blessed
apparitions
shining
in
pure
light
herself
pure
and
not
as
yet
entombed
in
the
body
and
still
like
a
bird
eager
to
quit
its
cage
she
flutters
and
looks
upwards
and
is
therefore
deemed
mad
such
a
recollection
of
past
days
she
receives
through
sight
the
keenest
of
our
senses
because
beauty
alone
of
the
ideas
has
any
representation
on
earth
wisdom
is
invisible
to
mortal
eyes
but
the
corrupted
nature
blindly
excited
by
this
vision
of
beauty
rushes
on
to
enjoy
and
would
fain
wallow
like
a
brute
beast
in
sensual
pleasures
whereas
the
true
mystic
who
has
seen
the
many
sights
of
bliss
when
he
beholds
a
form
or
face
is
amazed
with
delight
and
if
he
were
not
afraid
of
being
thought
mad
he
would
fall
down
and
worship
then
the
stiffened
wing
begins
to
relax
and
grow
again
desire
which
has
been
imprisoned
pours
over
the
soul
of
the
lover
the
germ
of
the
wing
unfolds
and
stings
and
pangs
of
birth
like
the
cutting
of
teeth
are
everywhere
felt
compare
symp
father
and
mother
and
goods
and
laws
and
proprieties
are
nothing
to
him
his
beloved
is
his
physician
who
can
alone
cure
his
pain
an
apocryphal
sacred
writer
says
that
the
power
which
thus
works
in
him
is
by
mortals
called
love
but
the
immortals
call
him
dove
or
the
winged
one
in
order
to
represent
the
force
of
his
wings
such
at
any
rate
is
his
nature
now
the
characters
of
lovers
depend
upon
the
god
whom
they
followed
in
the
other
world
and
they
choose
their
loves
in
this
world
accordingly
the
followers
of
ares
are
fierce
and
violent
those
of
zeus
seek
out
some
philosophical
and
imperial
nature
the
attendants
of
here
find
a
royal
love
and
in
like
manner
the
followers
of
every
god
seek
a
love
who
is
like
their
god
and
to
him
they
communicate
the
nature
which
they
have
received
from
their
god
the
manner
in
which
they
take
their
love
is
as
follows
i
told
you
about
the
charioteer
and
his
two
steeds
the
one
a
noble
animal
who
is
guided
by
word
and
admonition
only
the
other
an
villain
who
will
hardly
yield
to
blow
or
spur
together
all
three
who
are
a
figure
of
the
soul
approach
the
vision
of
love
and
now
a
fierce
conflict
begins
the
steed
rushes
on
to
enjoy
but
the
charioteer
who
beholds
the
beloved
with
awe
falls
back
in
adoration
and
forces
both
the
steeds
on
their
haunches
again
the
evil
steed
rushes
forwards
and
pulls
shamelessly
the
conflict
grows
more
and
more
severe
and
at
last
the
charioteer
throwing
himself
backwards
forces
the
bit
out
of
the
clenched
teeth
of
the
brute
and
pulling
harder
than
ever
at
the
reins
covers
his
tongue
and
jaws
with
blood
and
forces
him
to
rest
his
legs
and
haunches
with
pain
upon
the
ground
when
this
has
happened
several
times
the
villain
is
tamed
and
humbled
and
from
that
time
forward
the
soul
of
the
lover
follows
the
beloved
in
modesty
and
holy
fear
and
now
their
bliss
is
consummated
the
same
image
of
love
dwells
in
the
breast
of
either
and
if
they
have
they
pass
their
lives
in
the
greatest
happiness
which
is
attainable
by
man
they
continue
masters
of
themselves
and
conquer
in
one
of
the
three
heavenly
victories
but
if
they
choose
the
lower
life
of
ambition
they
may
still
have
a
happy
destiny
though
inferior
because
they
have
not
the
approval
of
the
whole
soul
at
last
they
leave
the
body
and
proceed
on
their
pilgrim
progress
and
those
who
have
once
begun
can
never
go
back
when
the
time
comes
they
receive
their
wings
and
fly
away
and
the
lovers
have
the
same
wings
socrates
concludes
these
are
the
blessings
of
love
and
thus
have
i
made
my
recantation
in
finer
language
than
before
i
did
so
in
order
to
please
phaedrus
if
i
said
what
was
wrong
at
first
please
to
attribute
my
error
to
lysias
who
ought
to
study
philosophy
instead
of
rhetoric
and
then
he
will
not
mislead
his
disciple
phaedrus
phaedrus
is
afraid
that
he
will
lose
conceit
of
lysias
and
that
lysias
will
be
out
of
conceit
with
himself
and
leave
off
making
speeches
for
the
politicians
have
been
deriding
him
socrates
is
of
opinion
that
there
is
small
danger
of
this
the
politicians
are
themselves
the
great
rhetoricians
of
the
age
who
desire
to
attain
immortality
by
the
authorship
of
laws
and
therefore
there
is
nothing
with
which
they
can
reproach
lysias
in
being
a
writer
but
there
may
be
disgrace
in
being
a
bad
one
and
what
is
good
or
bad
writing
or
speaking
while
the
sun
is
hot
in
the
sky
above
us
let
us
ask
that
question
since
by
rational
conversation
man
lives
and
not
by
the
indulgence
of
bodily
pleasures
and
the
grasshoppers
who
are
chirruping
around
may
carry
our
words
to
the
muses
who
are
their
patronesses
for
the
grasshoppers
were
human
beings
themselves
in
a
world
before
the
muses
and
when
the
muses
came
they
died
of
hunger
for
the
love
of
song
and
they
carry
to
them
in
heaven
the
report
of
those
who
honour
them
on
earth
the
first
rule
of
good
speaking
is
to
know
and
speak
the
truth
as
a
spartan
proverb
says
art
is
truth
whereas
rhetoric
is
an
art
of
enchantment
which
makes
things
appear
good
and
evil
like
and
unlike
as
the
speaker
pleases
its
use
is
not
confined
as
people
commonly
suppose
to
arguments
in
the
law
courts
and
speeches
in
the
assembly
it
is
rather
a
part
of
the
art
of
disputation
under
which
are
included
both
the
rules
of
gorgias
and
the
eristic
of
zeno
but
it
is
not
wholly
devoid
of
truth
superior
knowledge
enables
us
to
deceive
another
by
the
help
of
resemblances
and
to
escape
from
such
a
deception
when
employed
against
ourselves
we
see
therefore
that
even
in
rhetoric
an
element
of
truth
is
required
for
if
we
do
not
know
the
truth
we
can
neither
make
the
gradual
departures
from
truth
by
which
men
are
most
easily
deceived
nor
guard
ourselves
against
deception
socrates
then
proposes
that
they
shall
use
the
two
speeches
as
illustrations
of
the
art
of
rhetoric
first
distinguishing
between
the
debatable
and
undisputed
class
of
subjects
in
the
debatable
class
there
ought
to
be
a
definition
of
all
disputed
matters
but
there
was
no
such
definition
in
the
speech
of
lysias
nor
is
there
any
order
or
connection
in
his
words
any
more
than
in
a
nursery
rhyme
with
this
he
compares
the
regular
divisions
of
the
other
speech
which
was
his
own
and
yet
not
his
own
for
the
local
deities
must
have
inspired
him
although
only
a
playful
composition
it
will
be
found
to
embody
two
principles
first
that
of
synthesis
or
the
comprehension
of
parts
in
a
whole
secondly
analysis
or
the
resolution
of
the
whole
into
parts
these
are
the
processes
of
division
and
generalization
which
are
so
dear
to
the
dialectician
that
king
of
men
they
are
effected
by
dialectic
and
not
by
rhetoric
of
which
the
remains
are
but
scanty
after
order
and
arrangement
have
been
subtracted
there
is
nothing
left
but
a
heap
of
and
other
technical
terms
invented
by
polus
theodorus
evenus
tisias
gorgias
and
others
who
have
rules
for
everything
and
who
teach
how
to
be
short
or
long
at
pleasure
prodicus
showed
his
good
sense
when
he
said
that
there
was
a
better
thing
than
either
to
be
short
or
long
which
was
to
be
of
convenient
length
still
notwithstanding
the
absurdities
of
polus
and
others
rhetoric
has
great
power
in
public
assemblies
this
power
however
is
not
given
by
any
technical
rules
but
is
the
gift
of
genius
the
real
art
is
always
being
confused
by
rhetoricians
with
the
preliminaries
of
the
art
the
perfection
of
oratory
is
like
the
perfection
of
anything
else
natural
power
must
be
aided
by
art
but
the
art
is
not
that
which
is
taught
in
the
schools
of
rhetoric
it
is
nearer
akin
to
philosophy
pericles
for
instance
who
was
the
most
accomplished
of
all
speakers
derived
his
eloquence
not
from
rhetoric
but
from
the
philosophy
of
nature
which
he
learnt
of
anaxagoras
true
rhetoric
is
like
medicine
and
the
rhetorician
has
to
consider
the
natures
of
men
souls
as
the
physician
considers
the
natures
of
their
bodies
such
and
such
persons
are
to
be
affected
in
this
way
such
and
such
others
in
that
and
he
must
know
the
times
and
the
seasons
for
saying
this
or
that
this
is
not
an
easy
task
and
this
if
there
be
such
an
art
is
the
art
of
rhetoric
i
know
that
there
are
some
professors
of
the
art
who
maintain
probability
to
be
stronger
than
truth
but
we
maintain
that
probability
is
engendered
by
likeness
of
the
truth
which
can
only
be
attained
by
the
knowledge
of
it
and
that
the
aim
of
the
good
man
should
not
be
to
please
or
persuade
his
but
to
please
his
good
masters
who
are
the
gods
rhetoric
has
a
fair
beginning
in
this
enough
of
the
art
of
speaking
let
us
now
proceed
to
consider
the
true
use
of
writing
there
is
an
old
egyptian
tale
of
theuth
the
inventor
of
writing
showing
his
invention
to
the
god
thamus
who
told
him
that
he
would
only
spoil
men
memories
and
take
away
their
understandings
from
this
tale
of
which
young
athens
will
probably
make
fun
may
be
gathered
the
lesson
that
writing
is
inferior
to
speech
for
it
is
like
a
picture
which
can
give
no
answer
to
a
question
and
has
only
a
deceitful
likeness
of
a
living
creature
it
has
no
power
of
adaptation
but
uses
the
same
words
for
all
it
is
not
a
legitimate
son
of
knowledge
but
a
bastard
and
when
an
attack
is
made
upon
this
bastard
neither
parent
nor
anyone
else
is
there
to
defend
it
the
husbandman
will
not
seriously
incline
to
sow
his
seed
in
such
a
or
garden
of
adonis
he
will
rather
sow
in
the
natural
soil
of
the
human
soul
which
has
depth
of
earth
and
he
will
anticipate
the
inner
growth
of
the
mind
by
writing
only
if
at
all
as
a
remedy
against
old
age
the
natural
process
will
be
far
nobler
and
will
bring
forth
fruit
in
the
minds
of
others
as
well
as
in
his
own
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
is
just
this
that
until
a
man
knows
the
truth
and
the
manner
of
adapting
the
truth
to
the
natures
of
other
men
he
can
not
be
a
good
orator
also
that
the
living
is
better
than
the
written
word
and
that
the
principles
of
justice
and
truth
when
delivered
by
word
of
mouth
are
the
legitimate
offspring
of
a
man
own
bosom
and
their
lawful
descendants
take
up
their
abode
in
others
such
an
orator
as
he
is
who
is
possessed
of
them
you
and
i
would
fain
become
and
to
all
composers
in
the
world
poets
orators
legislators
we
hereby
announce
that
if
their
compositions
are
based
upon
these
principles
then
they
are
not
only
poets
orators
legislators
but
philosophers
all
others
are
mere
flatterers
and
putters
together
of
words
this
is
the
message
which
phaedrus
undertakes
to
carry
to
lysias
from
the
local
deities
and
socrates
himself
will
carry
a
similar
message
to
his
favourite
isocrates
whose
future
distinction
as
a
great
rhetorician
he
prophesies
the
heat
of
the
day
has
passed
and
after
offering
up
a
prayer
to
pan
and
the
nymphs
socrates
and
phaedrus
depart
there
are
two
principal
controversies
which
have
been
raised
about
the
phaedrus
the
first
relates
to
the
subject
the
second
to
the
date
of
the
dialogue
there
seems
to
be
a
notion
that
the
work
of
a
great
artist
like
plato
can
not
fail
in
unity
and
that
the
unity
of
a
dialogue
requires
a
single
subject
but
the
conception
of
unity
really
applies
in
very
different
degrees
and
ways
to
different
kinds
of
art
to
a
statue
for
example
far
more
than
to
any
kind
of
literary
composition
and
to
some
species
of
literature
far
more
than
to
others
nor
does
the
dialogue
appear
to
be
a
style
of
composition
in
which
the
requirement
of
unity
is
most
stringent
nor
should
the
idea
of
unity
derived
from
one
sort
of
art
be
hastily
transferred
to
another
the
double
titles
of
several
of
the
platonic
dialogues
are
a
further
proof
that
the
severer
rule
was
not
observed
by
plato
the
republic
is
divided
between
the
search
after
justice
and
the
construction
of
the
ideal
state
the
parmenides
between
the
criticism
of
the
platonic
ideas
and
of
the
eleatic
one
or
being
the
gorgias
between
the
art
of
speaking
and
the
nature
of
the
good
the
sophist
between
the
detection
of
the
sophist
and
the
correlation
of
ideas
the
theaetetus
the
politicus
and
the
philebus
have
also
digressions
which
are
but
remotely
connected
with
the
main
subject
thus
the
comparison
of
plato
other
writings
as
well
as
the
reason
of
the
thing
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
we
must
not
expect
to
find
one
idea
pervading
a
whole
work
but
one
two
or
more
as
the
invention
of
the
writer
may
suggest
or
his
fancy
wander
if
each
dialogue
were
confined
to
the
development
of
a
single
idea
this
would
appear
on
the
face
of
the
dialogue
nor
could
any
controversy
be
raised
as
to
whether
the
phaedrus
treated
of
love
or
rhetoric
but
the
truth
is
that
plato
subjects
himself
to
no
rule
of
this
sort
like
every
great
artist
he
gives
unity
of
form
to
the
different
and
apparently
distracting
topics
which
he
brings
together
he
works
freely
and
is
not
to
be
supposed
to
have
arranged
every
part
of
the
dialogue
before
he
begins
to
write
he
fastens
or
weaves
together
the
frame
of
his
discourse
loosely
and
imperfectly
and
which
is
the
warp
and
which
is
the
woof
can
not
always
be
determined
the
subjects
of
the
phaedrus
exclusive
of
the
short
introductory
passage
about
mythology
which
is
suggested
by
the
local
tradition
are
first
the
false
or
conventional
art
of
rhetoric
secondly
love
or
the
inspiration
of
beauty
and
knowledge
which
is
described
as
madness
thirdly
dialectic
or
the
art
of
composition
and
division
fourthly
the
true
rhetoric
which
is
based
upon
dialectic
and
is
neither
the
art
of
persuasion
nor
knowledge
of
the
truth
alone
but
the
art
of
persuasion
founded
on
knowledge
of
truth
and
knowledge
of
character
fifthly
the
superiority
of
the
spoken
over
the
written
word
the
continuous
thread
which
appears
and
reappears
throughout
is
rhetoric
this
is
the
ground
into
which
the
rest
of
the
dialogue
is
worked
in
parts
embroidered
with
fine
words
which
are
not
in
socrates
manner
as
he
says
order
to
please
phaedrus
the
speech
of
lysias
which
has
thrown
phaedrus
into
an
ecstacy
is
adduced
as
an
example
of
the
false
rhetoric
the
first
speech
of
socrates
though
an
improvement
partakes
of
the
same
character
his
second
speech
which
is
full
of
that
higher
element
said
to
have
been
learned
of
anaxagoras
by
pericles
and
which
in
the
midst
of
poetry
does
not
forget
order
is
an
illustration
of
the
higher
or
true
rhetoric
this
higher
rhetoric
is
based
upon
dialectic
and
dialectic
is
a
sort
of
inspiration
akin
to
love
compare
symp
in
these
two
aspects
of
philosophy
the
technicalities
of
rhetoric
are
absorbed
and
so
the
example
becomes
also
the
deeper
theme
of
discourse
the
true
knowledge
of
things
in
heaven
and
earth
is
based
upon
enthusiasm
or
love
of
the
ideas
going
before
us
and
ever
present
to
us
in
this
world
and
in
another
and
the
true
order
of
speech
or
writing
proceeds
accordingly
love
again
has
three
degrees
first
of
interested
love
corresponding
to
the
conventionalities
of
rhetoric
secondly
of
disinterested
or
mad
love
fixed
on
objects
of
sense
and
answering
perhaps
to
poetry
thirdly
of
disinterested
love
directed
towards
the
unseen
answering
to
dialectic
or
the
science
of
the
ideas
lastly
the
art
of
rhetoric
in
the
lower
sense
is
found
to
rest
on
a
knowledge
of
the
natures
and
characters
of
men
which
socrates
at
the
commencement
of
the
dialogue
has
described
as
his
own
peculiar
study
thus
amid
discord
a
harmony
begins
to
appear
there
are
many
links
of
connection
which
are
not
visible
at
first
sight
at
the
same
time
the
phaedrus
although
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
platonic
dialogues
is
also
more
irregular
than
any
other
for
insight
into
the
world
for
sustained
irony
for
depth
of
thought
there
is
no
dialogue
superior
or
perhaps
equal
to
it
nevertheless
the
form
of
the
work
has
tended
to
obscure
some
of
plato
higher
aims
the
first
speech
is
composed
that
balanced
style
in
which
the
wise
love
to
talk
the
characteristics
of
rhetoric
are
insipidity
mannerism
and
monotonous
parallelism
of
clauses
there
is
more
rhythm
than
reason
the
creative
power
of
imagination
is
wanting
greece
but
living
greece
no
more
plato
has
seized
by
anticipation
the
spirit
which
hung
over
greek
literature
for
a
thousand
years
afterwards
yet
doubtless
there
were
some
who
like
phaedrus
felt
a
delight
in
the
harmonious
cadence
and
the
pedantic
reasoning
of
the
rhetoricians
newly
imported
from
sicily
which
had
ceased
to
be
awakened
in
them
by
really
great
works
such
as
the
odes
of
anacreon
or
sappho
or
the
orations
of
pericles
that
the
first
speech
was
really
written
by
lysias
is
improbable
like
the
poem
of
solon
or
the
story
of
thamus
and
theuth
or
the
funeral
oration
of
aspasia
if
genuine
or
the
pretence
of
socrates
in
the
cratylus
that
his
knowledge
of
philology
is
derived
from
euthyphro
the
invention
is
really
due
to
the
imagination
of
plato
and
may
be
compared
to
the
parodies
of
the
sophists
in
the
protagoras
numerous
fictions
of
this
sort
occur
in
the
dialogues
and
the
gravity
of
plato
has
sometimes
imposed
upon
his
commentators
the
introduction
of
a
considerable
writing
of
another
would
seem
not
to
be
in
keeping
with
a
great
work
of
art
and
has
no
parallel
elsewhere
in
the
second
speech
socrates
is
exhibited
as
beating
the
rhetoricians
at
their
own
weapons
he
unpractised
man
and
they
masters
of
the
art
true
to
his
character
he
must
however
profess
that
the
speech
which
he
makes
is
not
his
own
for
he
knows
nothing
of
himself
compare
symp
regarded
as
a
rhetorical
exercise
the
superiority
of
his
speech
seems
to
consist
chiefly
in
a
better
arrangement
of
the
topics
he
begins
with
a
definition
of
love
and
he
gives
weight
to
his
words
by
going
back
to
general
maxims
a
lesser
merit
is
the
greater
liveliness
of
socrates
which
hurries
him
into
verse
and
relieves
the
monotony
of
the
style
but
plato
had
doubtless
a
higher
purpose
than
to
exhibit
socrates
as
the
rival
or
superior
of
the
athenian
rhetoricians
even
in
the
speech
of
lysias
there
is
a
germ
of
truth
and
this
is
further
developed
in
the
parallel
oration
of
socrates
first
passionate
love
is
overthrown
by
the
sophistical
or
interested
and
then
both
yield
to
that
higher
view
of
love
which
is
afterwards
revealed
to
us
the
extreme
of
commonplace
is
contrasted
with
the
most
ideal
and
imaginative
of
speculations
socrates
half
in
jest
and
to
satisfy
his
own
wild
humour
takes
the
disguise
of
lysias
but
he
is
also
in
profound
earnest
and
in
a
deeper
vein
of
irony
than
usual
having
improvised
his
own
speech
which
is
based
upon
the
model
of
the
preceding
he
condemns
them
both
yet
the
condemnation
is
not
to
be
taken
seriously
for
he
is
evidently
trying
to
express
an
aspect
of
the
truth
to
understand
him
we
must
make
abstraction
of
morality
and
of
the
greek
manner
of
regarding
the
relation
of
the
sexes
in
this
as
in
his
other
discussions
about
love
what
plato
says
of
the
loves
of
men
must
be
transferred
to
the
loves
of
women
before
we
can
attach
any
serious
meaning
to
his
words
had
he
lived
in
our
times
he
would
have
made
the
transposition
himself
but
seeing
in
his
own
age
the
impossibility
of
woman
being
the
intellectual
helpmate
or
friend
of
man
except
in
the
rare
instances
of
a
diotima
or
an
aspasia
seeing
that
even
as
to
personal
beauty
her
place
was
taken
by
young
mankind
instead
of
womankind
he
tries
to
work
out
the
problem
of
love
without
regard
to
the
distinctions
of
nature
and
full
of
the
evils
which
he
recognized
as
flowing
from
the
spurious
form
of
love
he
proceeds
with
a
deep
meaning
though
partly
in
joke
to
show
that
the
love
is
better
than
the
we
may
raise
the
same
question
in
another
form
is
marriage
preferable
with
or
without
love
ourselves
as
we
may
say
a
little
parodying
the
words
of
pausanias
in
the
symposium
would
be
one
answer
to
this
question
the
practice
and
feeling
of
some
foreign
countries
appears
to
be
more
doubtful
suppose
a
modern
socrates
in
defiance
of
the
received
notions
of
society
and
the
sentimental
literature
of
the
day
alone
against
all
the
writers
and
readers
of
novels
to
suggest
this
enquiry
would
not
the
younger
of
the
world
be
ready
to
take
off
its
coat
and
run
at
him
might
and
main
republic
yet
if
like
peisthetaerus
in
aristophanes
he
could
persuade
the
to
hear
him
retiring
a
little
behind
a
rampart
not
of
pots
and
dishes
but
of
unreadable
books
he
might
have
something
to
say
for
himself
might
he
not
argue
a
rational
being
should
not
follow
the
dictates
of
passion
in
the
most
important
act
of
his
or
her
life
who
would
willingly
enter
into
a
contract
at
first
sight
almost
without
thought
against
the
advice
and
opinion
of
his
friends
at
a
time
when
he
acknowledges
that
he
is
not
in
his
right
mind
and
yet
they
are
praised
by
the
authors
of
romances
who
reject
the
warnings
of
their
friends
or
parents
rather
than
those
who
listen
to
them
in
such
matters
two
inexperienced
persons
ignorant
of
the
world
and
of
one
another
how
can
they
be
said
to
choose
they
draw
lots
whence
also
the
saying
is
a
lottery
then
he
would
describe
their
way
of
life
after
marriage
how
they
monopolize
one
another
affections
to
the
exclusion
of
friends
and
relations
how
they
pass
their
days
in
unmeaning
fondness
or
trivial
conversation
how
the
inferior
of
the
two
drags
the
other
down
to
his
or
her
level
how
the
cares
of
a
family
meanness
in
their
souls
in
the
fulfilment
of
military
or
public
duties
they
are
not
helpers
but
hinderers
of
one
another
they
can
not
undertake
any
noble
enterprise
such
as
makes
the
names
of
men
and
women
famous
from
domestic
considerations
too
late
their
eyes
are
opened
they
were
taken
unawares
and
desire
to
part
company
better
he
would
say
a
love
at
the
beginning
for
heaven
might
have
increased
it
but
now
their
foolish
fondness
has
changed
into
mutual
dislike
in
the
days
of
their
honeymoon
they
never
understood
that
they
must
provide
against
offences
that
they
must
have
interests
that
they
must
learn
the
art
of
living
as
well
as
loving
our
misogamist
will
not
appeal
to
anacreon
or
sappho
for
a
confirmation
of
his
view
but
to
the
universal
experience
of
mankind
how
much
nobler
in
conclusion
he
will
say
is
friendship
which
does
not
receive
unmeaning
praises
from
novelists
and
poets
is
not
exacting
or
exclusive
is
not
impaired
by
familiarity
is
much
less
expensive
is
not
so
likely
to
take
offence
seldom
changes
and
may
be
dissolved
from
time
to
time
without
the
assistance
of
the
courts
besides
he
will
remark
that
there
is
a
much
greater
choice
of
friends
than
of
wives
you
may
have
more
of
them
and
they
will
be
far
more
improving
to
your
mind
they
will
not
keep
you
dawdling
at
home
or
dancing
attendance
upon
them
or
withdraw
you
from
the
great
world
and
stirring
scenes
of
life
and
action
which
would
make
a
man
of
you
in
such
a
manner
turning
the
seamy
side
outwards
a
modern
socrates
might
describe
the
evils
of
married
and
domestic
life
they
are
evils
which
mankind
in
general
have
agreed
to
conceal
partly
because
they
are
compensated
by
greater
goods
socrates
or
archilochus
would
soon
have
to
sing
a
palinode
for
the
injustice
done
to
lovely
helen
or
some
misfortune
worse
than
blindness
might
be
fall
them
then
they
would
take
up
their
parable
again
and
say
that
there
were
two
loves
a
higher
and
a
lower
holy
and
unholy
a
love
of
the
mind
and
a
love
of
the
body
me
not
to
the
marriage
of
true
minds
admit
impediments
love
is
not
love
which
alters
when
it
alteration
finds
love
not
time
fool
though
rosy
lips
and
cheeks
within
his
bending
sickle
compass
come
love
alters
not
with
his
brief
hours
and
weeks
but
bears
it
out
even
to
the
edge
of
doom
but
this
true
love
of
the
mind
can
not
exist
between
two
souls
until
they
are
purified
from
the
grossness
of
earthly
passion
they
must
pass
through
a
time
of
trial
and
conflict
first
in
the
language
of
religion
they
must
be
converted
or
born
again
then
they
would
see
the
world
transformed
into
a
scene
of
heavenly
beauty
a
divine
idea
would
accompany
them
in
all
their
thoughts
and
actions
something
too
of
the
recollections
of
childhood
might
float
about
them
still
they
might
regain
that
old
simplicity
which
had
been
theirs
in
other
days
at
their
first
entrance
on
life
and
although
their
love
of
one
another
was
ever
present
to
them
they
would
acknowledge
also
a
higher
love
of
duty
and
of
god
which
united
them
and
their
happiness
would
depend
upon
their
preserving
in
them
this
principle
not
losing
the
ideals
of
justice
and
holiness
and
truth
but
renewing
them
at
the
fountain
of
light
when
they
have
attained
to
this
exalted
state
let
them
marry
something
too
may
be
conceded
to
the
animal
nature
of
man
or
live
together
in
holy
and
innocent
friendship
the
poet
might
describe
in
eloquent
words
the
nature
of
such
a
union
how
after
many
struggles
the
true
love
was
found
how
the
two
passed
their
lives
together
in
the
service
of
god
and
man
how
their
characters
were
reflected
upon
one
another
and
seemed
to
grow
more
like
year
by
year
how
they
read
in
one
another
eyes
the
thoughts
wishes
actions
of
the
other
how
they
saw
each
other
in
god
how
in
a
figure
they
grew
wings
like
doves
and
were
to
fly
away
together
and
be
at
rest
and
lastly
he
might
tell
how
after
a
time
at
no
long
intervals
first
one
and
then
the
other
fell
asleep
and
to
the
unwise
to
die
but
were
reunited
in
another
state
of
being
in
which
they
saw
justice
and
holiness
and
truth
not
according
to
the
imperfect
copies
of
them
which
are
found
in
this
world
but
justice
absolute
in
existence
absolute
and
so
of
the
rest
and
they
would
hold
converse
not
only
with
each
other
but
with
blessed
souls
everywhere
and
would
be
employed
in
the
service
of
god
every
soul
fulfilling
his
own
nature
and
character
and
would
see
into
the
wonders
of
earth
and
heaven
and
trace
the
works
of
creation
to
their
author
so
partly
in
jest
but
also
a
certain
degree
of
seriousness
we
may
appropriate
to
ourselves
the
words
of
plato
the
use
of
such
a
parody
though
very
imperfect
is
to
transfer
his
thoughts
to
our
sphere
of
religion
and
feeling
to
bring
him
nearer
to
us
and
us
to
him
like
the
scriptures
plato
admits
of
endless
applications
if
we
allow
for
the
difference
of
times
and
manners
and
we
lose
the
better
half
of
him
when
we
regard
his
dialogues
merely
as
literary
compositions
any
ancient
work
which
is
worth
reading
has
a
practical
and
speculative
as
well
as
a
literary
interest
and
in
plato
more
than
in
any
other
greek
writer
the
local
and
transitory
is
inextricably
blended
with
what
is
spiritual
and
eternal
socrates
is
necessarily
ironical
for
he
has
to
withdraw
from
the
received
opinions
and
beliefs
of
mankind
we
can
not
separate
the
transitory
from
the
permanent
nor
can
we
translate
the
language
of
irony
into
that
of
plain
reflection
and
common
sense
but
we
can
imagine
the
mind
of
socrates
in
another
age
and
country
and
we
can
interpret
him
by
analogy
with
reference
to
the
errors
and
prejudices
which
prevail
among
ourselves
to
return
to
the
phaedrus
both
speeches
are
strongly
condemned
by
socrates
as
sinful
and
blasphemous
towards
the
god
love
and
as
worthy
only
of
some
haunt
of
sailors
to
which
good
manners
were
unknown
the
meaning
of
this
and
other
wild
language
to
the
same
effect
which
is
introduced
by
way
of
contrast
to
the
formality
of
the
two
speeches
socrates
has
a
sense
of
relief
when
he
has
escaped
from
the
trammels
of
rhetoric
seems
to
be
that
the
two
speeches
proceed
upon
the
supposition
that
love
is
and
ought
to
be
interested
and
that
no
such
thing
as
a
real
or
disinterested
passion
which
would
be
at
the
same
time
lasting
could
be
conceived
did
i
call
this
love
o
god
forgive
my
blasphemy
this
is
not
love
rather
it
is
the
love
of
the
world
but
there
is
another
kingdom
of
love
a
kingdom
not
of
this
world
divine
eternal
and
this
other
love
i
will
now
show
you
in
a
mystery
then
follows
the
famous
myth
which
is
a
sort
of
parable
and
like
other
parables
ought
not
to
receive
too
minute
an
interpretation
in
all
such
allegories
there
is
a
great
deal
which
is
merely
ornamental
and
the
interpreter
has
to
separate
the
important
from
the
unimportant
socrates
himself
has
given
the
right
clue
when
in
using
his
own
discourse
afterwards
as
the
text
for
his
examination
of
rhetoric
he
characterizes
it
as
a
true
and
tolerably
credible
mythus
in
which
amid
poetical
figures
order
and
arrangement
were
not
forgotten
the
soul
is
described
in
magnificent
language
as
the
and
the
source
of
motion
in
all
other
things
this
is
the
philosophical
theme
or
proem
of
the
whole
but
ideas
must
be
given
through
something
and
under
the
pretext
that
to
realize
the
true
nature
of
the
soul
would
be
not
only
tedious
but
impossible
we
at
once
pass
on
to
describe
the
souls
of
gods
as
well
as
men
under
the
figure
of
two
winged
steeds
and
a
charioteer
no
connection
is
traced
between
the
soul
as
the
great
motive
power
and
the
triple
soul
which
is
thus
imaged
there
is
no
difficulty
in
seeing
that
the
charioteer
represents
the
reason
or
that
the
black
horse
is
the
symbol
of
the
sensual
or
concupiscent
element
of
human
nature
the
white
horse
also
represents
rational
impulse
but
the
description
lover
of
honour
and
modesty
and
temperance
and
a
follower
of
true
glory
though
similar
does
not
at
once
recall
the
thumos
of
the
republic
the
two
steeds
really
correspond
in
a
figure
more
nearly
to
the
appetitive
and
moral
or
soul
of
aristotle
and
thus
for
the
first
time
perhaps
in
the
history
of
philosophy
we
have
represented
to
us
the
threefold
division
of
psychology
the
image
of
the
charioteer
and
the
steeds
has
been
compared
with
a
similar
image
which
occurs
in
the
verses
of
parmenides
but
it
is
important
to
remark
that
the
horses
of
parmenides
have
no
allegorical
meaning
and
that
the
poet
is
only
describing
his
own
approach
in
a
chariot
to
the
regions
of
light
and
the
house
of
the
goddess
of
truth
the
triple
soul
has
had
a
previous
existence
in
which
following
in
the
train
of
some
god
from
whom
she
derived
her
character
she
beheld
partially
and
imperfectly
the
vision
of
absolute
truth
all
her
after
existence
passed
in
many
forms
of
men
and
animals
is
spent
in
regaining
this
the
stages
of
the
conflict
are
many
and
various
and
she
is
sorely
let
and
hindered
by
the
animal
desires
of
the
inferior
or
concupiscent
steed
again
and
again
she
beholds
the
flashing
beauty
of
the
beloved
but
before
that
vision
can
be
finally
enjoyed
the
animal
desires
must
be
subjected
the
moral
or
spiritual
element
in
man
is
represented
by
the
immortal
steed
which
like
thumos
in
the
republic
always
sides
with
the
reason
both
are
dragged
out
of
their
course
by
the
furious
impulses
of
desire
in
the
end
something
is
conceded
to
the
desires
after
they
have
been
finally
humbled
and
overpowered
and
yet
the
way
of
philosophy
or
perfect
love
of
the
unseen
is
total
abstinence
from
bodily
delights
all
men
can
not
receive
this
saying
in
the
lower
life
of
ambition
they
may
be
taken
off
their
guard
and
stoop
to
folly
unawares
and
then
although
they
do
not
attain
to
the
highest
bliss
yet
if
they
have
once
conquered
they
may
be
happy
enough
the
language
of
the
meno
and
the
phaedo
as
well
as
of
the
phaedrus
seems
to
show
that
at
one
time
of
his
life
plato
was
quite
serious
in
maintaining
a
former
state
of
existence
his
mission
was
to
realize
the
abstract
in
that
all
good
and
truth
all
the
hopes
of
this
and
another
life
seemed
to
centre
to
him
abstractions
as
we
call
them
were
another
kind
of
knowledge
an
inner
and
unseen
world
which
seemed
to
exist
far
more
truly
than
the
fleeting
objects
of
sense
which
were
without
him
when
we
are
once
able
to
imagine
the
intense
power
which
abstract
ideas
exercised
over
the
mind
of
plato
we
see
that
there
was
no
more
difficulty
to
him
in
realizing
the
eternal
existence
of
them
and
of
the
human
minds
which
were
associated
with
them
in
the
past
and
future
than
in
the
present
the
difficulty
was
not
how
they
could
exist
but
how
they
could
fail
to
exist
in
the
attempt
to
regain
this
knowledge
of
the
ideas
the
sense
was
found
to
be
as
great
an
enemy
as
the
desires
and
hence
two
things
which
to
us
seem
quite
distinct
are
inextricably
blended
in
the
representation
of
plato
thus
far
we
may
believe
that
plato
was
serious
in
his
conception
of
the
soul
as
a
motive
power
in
his
reminiscence
of
a
former
state
of
being
in
his
elevation
of
the
reason
over
sense
and
passion
and
perhaps
in
his
doctrine
of
transmigration
was
he
equally
serious
in
the
rest
for
example
are
we
to
attribute
his
tripartite
division
of
the
soul
to
the
gods
or
is
this
merely
assigned
to
them
by
way
of
parallelism
with
men
the
latter
is
the
more
probable
for
the
horses
of
the
gods
are
both
white
their
every
impulse
is
in
harmony
with
reason
their
dualism
on
the
other
hand
only
carries
out
the
figure
of
the
chariot
is
he
serious
again
in
regarding
love
as
madness
that
seems
to
arise
out
of
the
antithesis
to
the
former
conception
of
love
at
the
same
time
he
appears
to
intimate
here
as
in
the
ion
apology
meno
and
elsewhere
that
there
is
a
faculty
in
man
whether
to
be
termed
in
modern
language
genius
or
inspiration
or
imagination
or
idealism
or
communion
with
god
which
can
not
be
reduced
to
rule
and
measure
perhaps
too
he
is
ironically
repeating
the
common
language
of
mankind
about
philosophy
and
is
turning
their
jest
into
a
sort
of
earnest
compare
phaedo
symp
or
is
he
serious
in
holding
that
each
soul
bears
the
character
of
a
god
he
may
have
had
no
other
account
to
give
of
the
differences
of
human
characters
to
which
he
afterwards
refers
or
again
in
his
absurd
derivation
of
mantike
and
oionistike
and
imeros
compare
cratylus
it
is
characteristic
of
the
irony
of
socrates
to
mix
up
sense
and
nonsense
in
such
a
way
that
no
exact
line
can
be
drawn
between
them
and
allegory
helps
to
increase
this
sort
of
confusion
as
is
often
the
case
in
the
parables
and
prophecies
of
scripture
the
meaning
is
allowed
to
break
through
the
figure
and
the
details
are
not
always
consistent
when
the
charioteers
and
their
steeds
stand
upon
the
dome
of
heaven
they
behold
the
intangible
invisible
essences
which
are
not
objects
of
sight
this
is
because
the
force
of
language
can
no
further
go
nor
can
we
dwell
much
on
the
circumstance
that
at
the
completion
of
ten
thousand
years
all
are
to
return
to
the
place
from
whence
they
came
because
he
represents
their
return
as
dependent
on
their
own
good
conduct
in
the
successive
stages
of
existence
nor
again
can
we
attribute
anything
to
the
accidental
inference
which
would
also
follow
that
even
a
tyrant
may
live
righteously
in
the
condition
of
life
to
which
fate
has
called
him
aiblins
might
i
dinna
ken
but
to
suppose
this
would
be
at
variance
with
plato
himself
and
with
greek
notions
generally
he
is
much
more
serious
in
distinguishing
men
from
animals
by
their
recognition
of
the
universal
which
they
have
known
in
a
former
state
and
in
denying
that
this
gift
of
reason
can
ever
be
obliterated
or
lost
in
the
language
of
some
modern
theologians
he
might
be
said
to
maintain
the
perseverance
of
those
who
have
entered
on
their
pilgrim
progress
other
intimations
of
a
or
of
the
future
may
also
be
discerned
in
him
the
moderate
predestinarianism
which
here
as
in
the
republic
acknowledges
the
element
of
chance
in
human
life
and
yet
asserts
the
freedom
and
responsibility
of
man
the
recognition
of
a
moral
as
well
as
an
intellectual
principle
in
man
under
the
image
of
an
immortal
steed
the
notion
that
the
divine
nature
exists
by
the
contemplation
of
ideas
of
virtue
and
justice
or
in
other
words
the
assertion
of
the
essentially
moral
nature
of
god
again
there
is
the
hint
that
human
life
is
a
life
of
aspiration
only
and
that
the
true
ideal
is
not
to
be
found
in
art
there
occurs
the
first
trace
of
the
distinction
between
necessary
and
contingent
matter
the
conception
of
the
soul
itself
as
the
motive
power
and
reason
of
the
universe
the
conception
of
the
philosopher
or
the
philosopher
and
lover
in
one
as
a
sort
of
madman
may
be
compared
with
the
republic
and
theaetetus
in
both
of
which
the
philosopher
is
regarded
as
a
stranger
and
monster
upon
the
earth
the
whole
myth
like
the
other
myths
of
plato
describes
in
a
figure
things
which
are
beyond
the
range
of
human
faculties
or
inaccessible
to
the
knowledge
of
the
age
that
philosophy
should
be
represented
as
the
inspiration
of
love
is
a
conception
that
has
already
become
familiar
to
us
in
the
symposium
and
is
the
expression
partly
of
plato
enthusiasm
for
the
idea
and
is
also
an
indication
of
the
real
power
exercised
by
the
passion
of
friendship
over
the
mind
of
the
greek
the
master
in
the
art
of
love
knew
that
there
was
a
mystery
in
these
feelings
and
their
associations
and
especially
in
the
contrast
of
the
sensible
and
permanent
which
is
afforded
by
them
and
he
sought
to
explain
this
as
he
explained
universal
ideas
by
a
reference
to
a
former
state
of
existence
the
capriciousness
of
love
is
also
derived
by
him
from
an
attachment
to
some
god
in
a
former
world
the
singular
remark
that
the
beloved
is
more
affected
than
the
lover
at
the
final
consummation
of
their
love
seems
likewise
to
hint
at
a
psychological
truth
it
is
difficult
to
exhaust
the
meanings
of
a
work
like
the
phaedrus
which
indicates
so
much
more
than
it
expresses
and
is
full
of
inconsistencies
and
ambiguities
which
were
not
perceived
by
plato
himself
for
example
when
he
is
speaking
of
the
soul
does
he
mean
the
human
or
the
divine
soul
and
are
they
both
equally
and
constructed
on
the
same
threefold
principle
we
should
certainly
be
disposed
to
reply
that
the
is
to
be
attributed
to
god
only
and
on
the
other
hand
that
the
appetitive
and
passionate
elements
have
no
place
in
his
nature
so
we
should
infer
from
the
reason
of
the
thing
but
there
is
no
indication
in
plato
own
writings
that
this
was
his
meaning
or
again
when
he
explains
the
different
characters
of
men
by
referring
them
back
to
the
nature
of
the
god
whom
they
served
in
a
former
state
of
existence
we
are
inclined
to
ask
whether
he
is
serious
is
he
not
rather
using
a
mythological
figure
here
as
elsewhere
to
draw
a
veil
over
things
which
are
beyond
the
limits
of
mortal
knowledge
once
more
in
speaking
of
beauty
is
he
really
thinking
of
some
external
form
such
as
might
have
been
expressed
in
the
works
of
phidias
or
praxiteles
and
not
rather
of
an
imaginary
beauty
of
a
sort
which
extinguishes
rather
than
stimulates
vulgar
love
a
heavenly
beauty
like
that
which
flashed
from
time
to
time
before
the
eyes
of
dante
or
bunyan
surely
the
latter
but
it
would
be
idle
to
reconcile
all
the
details
of
the
passage
it
is
a
picture
not
a
system
and
a
picture
which
is
for
the
greater
part
an
allegory
and
an
allegory
which
allows
the
meaning
to
come
through
the
image
of
the
charioteer
and
his
steeds
is
placed
side
by
side
with
the
absolute
forms
of
justice
temperance
and
the
like
which
are
abstract
ideas
only
and
which
are
seen
with
the
eye
of
the
soul
in
her
heavenly
journey
the
first
impression
of
such
a
passage
in
which
no
attempt
is
made
to
separate
the
substance
from
the
form
is
far
truer
than
an
elaborate
philosophical
analysis
it
is
too
often
forgotten
that
the
whole
of
the
second
discourse
of
socrates
is
only
an
allegory
or
figure
of
speech
for
this
reason
it
is
unnecessary
to
enquire
whether
the
love
of
which
plato
speaks
is
the
love
of
men
or
of
women
it
is
really
a
general
idea
which
includes
both
and
in
which
the
sensual
element
though
not
wholly
eradicated
is
reduced
to
order
and
measure
we
must
not
attribute
a
meaning
to
every
fanciful
detail
nor
is
there
any
need
to
call
up
revolting
associations
which
as
a
matter
of
good
taste
should
be
banished
and
which
were
far
enough
away
from
the
mind
of
plato
these
and
similar
passages
should
be
interpreted
by
the
laws
nor
is
there
anything
in
the
symposium
or
in
the
charmides
in
reality
inconsistent
with
the
sterner
rule
which
plato
lays
down
in
the
laws
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
love
and
philosophy
are
described
by
socrates
in
figures
of
speech
which
would
not
be
used
in
christian
times
or
that
nameless
vices
were
prevalent
at
athens
and
in
other
greek
cities
or
that
friendships
between
men
were
a
more
sacred
tie
and
had
a
more
important
social
and
educational
influence
than
among
ourselves
see
note
on
symposium
in
the
phaedrus
as
well
as
in
the
symposium
there
are
two
kinds
of
love
a
lower
and
a
higher
the
one
answering
to
the
natural
wants
of
the
animal
the
other
rising
above
them
and
contemplating
with
religious
awe
the
forms
of
justice
temperance
holiness
yet
finding
them
also
dazzling
bright
for
mortal
eye
and
shrinking
from
them
in
amazement
the
opposition
between
these
two
kinds
of
love
may
be
compared
to
the
opposition
between
the
flesh
and
the
spirit
in
the
epistles
of
paul
it
would
be
unmeaning
to
suppose
that
plato
in
describing
the
spiritual
combat
in
which
the
rational
soul
is
finally
victor
and
master
of
both
the
steeds
condescends
to
allow
any
indulgence
of
unnatural
lusts
two
other
thoughts
about
love
are
suggested
by
this
passage
first
of
all
love
is
represented
here
as
in
the
symposium
as
one
of
the
great
powers
of
nature
which
takes
many
forms
and
two
principal
ones
having
a
predominant
influence
over
the
lives
of
men
and
these
two
though
opposed
are
not
absolutely
separated
the
one
from
the
other
plato
with
his
great
knowledge
of
human
nature
was
well
aware
how
easily
one
is
transformed
into
the
other
or
how
soon
the
noble
but
fleeting
aspiration
may
return
into
the
nature
of
the
animal
while
the
lower
instinct
which
is
latent
always
remains
the
intermediate
sentimentalism
which
has
exercised
so
great
an
influence
on
the
literature
of
modern
europe
had
no
place
in
the
classical
times
of
hellas
the
higher
love
of
which
plato
speaks
is
the
subject
not
of
poetry
or
fiction
but
of
philosophy
secondly
there
seems
to
be
indicated
a
natural
yearning
of
the
human
mind
that
the
great
ideas
of
justice
temperance
wisdom
should
be
expressed
in
some
form
of
visible
beauty
like
the
absolute
purity
and
goodness
which
christian
art
has
sought
to
realize
in
the
person
of
the
madonna
but
although
human
nature
has
often
attempted
to
represent
outwardly
what
can
be
only
discerned
men
feel
that
in
pictures
and
images
whether
painted
or
carved
or
described
in
words
only
we
have
not
the
substance
but
the
shadow
of
the
truth
which
is
in
heaven
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
in
the
fairest
works
of
greek
art
plato
ever
conceived
himself
to
behold
an
image
however
faint
of
ideal
truths
in
that
way
was
wisdom
seen
we
may
now
pass
on
to
the
second
part
of
the
dialogue
which
is
a
criticism
on
the
first
rhetoric
is
assailed
on
various
grounds
first
as
desiring
to
persuade
without
a
knowledge
of
the
truth
and
secondly
as
ignoring
the
distinction
between
certain
and
probable
matter
the
three
speeches
are
then
passed
in
review
the
first
of
them
has
no
definition
of
the
nature
of
love
and
no
order
in
the
topics
being
in
these
respects
far
inferior
to
the
second
while
the
third
of
them
is
found
though
a
fancy
of
the
hour
to
be
framed
upon
real
dialectical
principles
but
dialectic
is
not
rhetoric
nothing
on
that
subject
is
to
be
found
in
the
endless
treatises
of
rhetoric
however
prolific
in
hard
names
when
plato
has
sufficiently
put
them
to
the
test
of
ridicule
he
touches
as
with
the
point
of
a
needle
the
real
error
which
is
the
confusion
of
preliminary
knowledge
with
creative
power
no
attainments
will
provide
the
speaker
with
genius
and
the
sort
of
attainments
which
can
alone
be
of
any
value
are
the
higher
philosophy
and
the
power
of
psychological
analysis
which
is
given
by
dialectic
but
not
by
the
rules
of
the
rhetoricians
in
this
latter
portion
of
the
dialogue
there
are
many
texts
which
may
help
us
to
speak
and
to
think
the
names
dialectic
and
rhetoric
are
passing
out
of
use
we
hardly
examine
seriously
into
their
nature
and
limits
and
probably
the
arts
both
of
speaking
and
of
conversation
have
been
unduly
neglected
by
us
but
the
mind
of
socrates
pierces
through
the
differences
of
times
and
countries
into
the
essential
nature
of
man
and
his
words
apply
equally
to
the
modern
world
and
to
the
athenians
of
old
would
he
not
have
asked
of
us
or
rather
is
he
not
asking
of
us
whether
we
have
ceased
to
prefer
appearances
to
reality
let
us
take
a
survey
of
the
professions
to
which
he
refers
and
try
them
by
his
standard
is
not
all
literature
passing
into
criticism
just
as
athenian
literature
in
the
age
of
plato
was
degenerating
into
sophistry
and
rhetoric
we
can
discourse
and
write
about
poems
and
paintings
but
we
seem
to
have
lost
the
gift
of
creating
them
can
we
wonder
that
few
of
them
sweetly
from
nature
while
ten
thousand
reviewers
mala
murioi
are
engaged
in
dissecting
them
young
men
like
phaedrus
are
enamoured
of
their
own
literary
clique
and
have
but
a
feeble
sympathy
with
the
of
former
ages
they
recognize
poetical
necessity
in
the
writings
of
their
favourite
author
even
when
he
boldly
wrote
off
just
what
came
in
his
head
they
are
beginning
to
think
that
art
is
enough
just
at
the
time
when
art
is
about
to
disappear
from
the
world
and
would
not
a
great
painter
such
as
michael
angelo
or
a
great
poet
such
as
shakespeare
returning
to
earth
us
would
he
not
say
that
we
are
putting
the
place
of
art
the
preliminaries
of
art
confusing
art
the
expression
of
mind
and
truth
with
art
the
composition
of
colours
and
forms
and
perhaps
he
might
more
severely
chastise
some
of
us
for
trying
to
invent
new
instead
of
bringing
to
the
birth
living
and
healthy
creations
these
he
would
regard
as
the
signs
of
an
age
wanting
in
original
power
turning
from
literature
and
the
arts
to
law
and
politics
again
we
fall
under
the
lash
of
socrates
for
do
we
not
often
make
worse
appear
the
better
cause
and
do
not
parties
sometimes
agree
to
tell
lies
is
not
pleading
art
of
speaking
unconnected
with
the
truth
there
is
another
text
of
socrates
which
must
not
be
forgotten
in
relation
to
this
subject
in
the
endless
maze
of
english
law
is
there
any
the
whole
into
parts
or
reuniting
the
parts
into
a
whole
any
semblance
of
an
organized
being
hands
and
feet
and
other
members
instead
of
a
system
there
is
the
chaos
of
anaxagoras
omou
panta
chremata
and
no
mind
or
order
then
again
in
the
noble
art
of
politics
who
thinks
of
first
principles
and
of
true
ideas
we
avowedly
follow
not
the
truth
but
the
will
of
the
many
compare
republic
is
not
legislation
too
a
sort
of
literary
effort
and
might
not
statesmanship
be
described
as
the
of
enchanting
the
house
while
there
are
some
politicians
who
have
no
knowledge
of
the
truth
but
only
of
what
is
likely
to
be
approved
by
many
who
sit
in
judgment
there
are
others
who
can
give
no
form
to
their
ideal
neither
having
learned
art
of
persuasion
nor
having
any
insight
into
the
of
men
once
more
has
not
medical
science
become
a
professional
routine
which
many
without
being
able
to
say
who
were
their
instructors
the
application
of
a
few
drugs
taken
from
a
book
instead
of
a
study
of
the
natures
and
constitutions
of
human
beings
do
we
see
as
clearly
as
hippocrates
the
nature
of
the
body
can
only
be
understood
as
a
whole
compare
charm
and
are
not
they
held
to
be
the
wisest
physicians
who
have
the
greatest
distrust
of
their
art
what
would
socrates
think
of
our
newspapers
of
our
theology
perhaps
he
would
be
afraid
to
speak
of
them
the
one
vox
populi
the
other
vox
dei
he
might
hesitate
to
attack
them
or
he
might
trace
a
fanciful
connexion
between
them
and
ask
doubtfully
whether
they
are
not
equally
inspired
he
would
remark
that
we
are
always
searching
for
a
belief
and
deploring
our
unbelief
seeming
to
prefer
popular
opinions
unverified
and
contradictory
to
unpopular
truths
which
are
assured
to
us
by
the
most
certain
proofs
that
our
preachers
are
in
the
habit
of
praising
god
regard
to
truth
and
falsehood
attributing
to
him
every
species
of
greatness
and
glory
saying
that
he
is
all
this
and
the
cause
of
all
that
in
order
that
we
may
exhibit
him
as
the
fairest
and
best
of
all
symp
without
any
consideration
of
his
real
nature
and
character
or
of
the
laws
by
which
he
governs
the
world
seeking
for
a
judgment
and
not
for
the
truth
or
judgment
what
would
he
say
of
the
church
which
we
praise
in
like
manner
ourselves
without
regard
to
history
or
experience
might
he
not
ask
whether
we
more
for
the
truth
of
religion
or
for
the
speaker
and
the
country
from
which
the
truth
comes
or
whether
the
wise
are
not
many
after
all
symp
so
we
may
fill
up
the
sketch
of
socrates
lest
as
phaedrus
says
the
argument
should
be
too
and
barren
of
illustrations
compare
euthyphro
he
next
proceeds
with
enthusiasm
to
define
the
royal
art
of
dialectic
as
the
power
of
dividing
a
whole
into
parts
and
of
uniting
the
parts
in
a
whole
and
which
may
also
be
regarded
compare
soph
as
the
process
of
the
mind
talking
with
herself
the
latter
view
has
probably
led
plato
to
the
paradox
that
speech
is
superior
to
writing
in
which
he
may
seem
also
to
be
doing
an
injustice
to
himself
for
the
two
can
not
be
fairly
compared
in
the
manner
which
plato
suggests
the
contrast
of
the
living
and
dead
word
and
the
example
of
socrates
which
he
has
represented
in
the
form
of
the
dialogue
seem
to
have
misled
him
for
speech
and
writing
have
really
different
functions
the
one
is
more
transitory
more
diffuse
more
elastic
and
capable
of
adaptation
to
moods
and
times
the
other
is
more
permanent
more
concentrated
and
is
uttered
not
to
this
or
that
person
or
audience
but
to
all
the
world
in
the
politicus
the
paradox
is
carried
further
the
mind
or
will
of
the
king
is
preferred
to
the
written
law
he
is
supposed
to
be
the
law
personified
the
ideal
made
life
yet
in
both
these
statements
there
is
also
contained
a
truth
they
may
be
compared
with
one
another
and
also
with
the
other
famous
paradox
that
can
not
be
taught
socrates
means
to
say
that
what
is
truly
written
is
written
in
the
soul
just
as
what
is
truly
taught
grows
up
in
the
soul
from
within
and
is
not
forced
upon
it
from
without
when
planted
in
a
congenial
soil
the
little
seed
becomes
a
tree
and
birds
of
the
air
build
their
nests
in
the
branches
there
is
an
echo
of
this
in
the
prayer
at
the
end
of
the
dialogue
me
beauty
in
the
inward
soul
and
may
the
inward
and
outward
man
be
at
one
we
may
further
compare
the
words
of
paul
not
on
tables
of
stone
but
on
fleshly
tables
of
the
heart
and
again
are
my
epistles
known
and
read
of
all
men
there
may
be
a
use
in
writing
as
a
preservative
against
the
forgetfulness
of
old
age
but
to
live
is
higher
far
to
be
ourselves
the
book
or
the
epistle
the
truth
embodied
in
a
person
the
word
made
flesh
something
like
this
we
may
believe
to
have
passed
before
plato
mind
when
he
affirmed
that
speech
was
superior
to
writing
so
in
other
ages
weary
of
literature
and
criticism
of
making
many
books
of
writing
articles
in
reviews
some
have
desired
to
live
more
closely
in
communion
with
their
to
speak
heart
to
heart
to
speak
and
act
only
and
not
to
write
following
the
example
of
socrates
and
of
christ
some
other
touches
of
inimitable
grace
and
art
and
of
the
deepest
wisdom
may
be
also
noted
such
as
the
prayer
or
which
has
just
been
cited
me
beauty
etc
or
great
name
which
belongs
to
god
alone
or
saying
of
wiser
men
than
ourselves
that
a
man
of
sense
should
try
to
please
not
his
but
his
good
and
noble
masters
like
paul
again
or
the
description
of
the
originals
the
chief
criteria
for
determining
the
date
of
the
dialogue
are
the
ages
of
lysias
and
isocrates
the
character
of
the
work
lysias
was
born
in
the
year
isocrates
in
the
year
about
seven
years
before
the
birth
of
plato
the
first
of
the
two
great
rhetoricians
is
described
as
in
the
zenith
of
his
fame
the
second
is
still
young
and
full
of
promise
now
it
is
argued
that
this
must
have
been
written
in
the
youth
of
isocrates
when
the
promise
was
not
yet
fulfilled
and
thus
we
should
have
to
assign
the
dialogue
to
a
year
not
later
than
when
isocrates
was
thirty
and
plato
years
of
age
and
while
socrates
himself
was
still
alive
those
who
argue
in
this
way
seem
not
to
reflect
how
easily
plato
can
egyptians
or
anything
else
and
how
careless
he
is
of
historical
truth
or
probability
who
would
suspect
that
the
wise
critias
the
virtuous
charmides
had
ended
their
lives
among
the
thirty
tyrants
who
would
imagine
that
lysias
who
is
here
assailed
by
socrates
is
the
son
of
his
old
friend
cephalus
or
that
isocrates
himself
is
the
enemy
of
plato
and
his
school
no
arguments
can
be
drawn
from
the
appropriateness
or
inappropriateness
of
the
characters
of
plato
else
perhaps
it
might
be
further
argued
that
judging
from
their
extant
remains
insipid
rhetoric
is
far
more
characteristic
of
isocrates
than
of
lysias
but
plato
makes
use
of
names
which
have
often
hardly
any
connection
with
the
historical
characters
to
whom
they
belong
in
this
instance
the
comparative
favour
shown
to
isocrates
may
possibly
be
accounted
for
by
the
circumstance
of
his
belonging
to
the
aristocratical
as
lysias
to
the
democratical
party
few
persons
will
be
inclined
to
suppose
in
the
superficial
manner
of
some
ancient
critics
that
a
dialogue
which
treats
of
love
must
necessarily
have
been
written
in
youth
as
little
weight
can
be
attached
to
the
argument
that
plato
must
have
visited
egypt
before
he
wrote
the
story
of
theuth
and
thamus
for
there
is
no
real
proof
that
he
ever
went
to
egypt
and
even
if
he
did
he
might
have
known
or
invented
egyptian
traditions
before
he
went
there
the
late
date
of
the
phaedrus
will
have
to
be
established
by
other
arguments
than
these
the
maturity
of
the
thought
the
perfection
of
the
style
the
insight
the
relation
to
the
other
platonic
dialogues
seem
to
contradict
the
notion
that
it
could
have
been
the
work
of
a
youth
of
twenty
or
years
of
age
the
cosmological
notion
of
the
mind
as
the
primum
mobile
and
the
admission
of
impulse
into
the
immortal
nature
also
afford
grounds
for
assigning
a
later
date
compare
laws
add
to
this
that
the
picture
of
socrates
though
in
some
lesser
particulars
his
going
without
sandals
his
habit
of
remaining
within
the
walls
his
emphatic
declaration
that
his
study
is
human
nature
an
exact
resemblance
is
in
the
main
the
platonic
and
not
the
real
socrates
can
we
suppose
young
man
to
have
told
such
lies
about
his
master
while
he
was
still
alive
moreover
when
two
dialogues
are
so
closely
connected
as
the
phaedrus
and
symposium
there
is
great
improbability
in
supposing
that
one
of
them
was
written
at
least
twenty
years
after
the
other
the
conclusion
seems
to
be
that
the
dialogue
was
written
at
some
comparatively
late
but
unknown
period
of
plato
life
after
he
had
deserted
the
purely
socratic
point
of
view
but
before
he
had
entered
on
the
more
abstract
speculations
of
the
sophist
or
the
philebus
taking
into
account
the
divisions
of
the
soul
the
doctrine
of
transmigration
the
contemplative
nature
of
the
philosophic
life
and
the
character
of
the
style
we
shall
not
be
far
wrong
in
placing
the
phaedrus
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
republic
remarking
only
that
allowance
must
be
made
for
the
poetical
element
in
the
phaedrus
which
while
falling
short
of
the
republic
in
definite
philosophic
results
seems
to
have
glimpses
of
a
truth
beyond
two
short
passages
which
are
unconnected
with
the
main
subject
of
the
dialogue
may
seem
to
merit
a
more
particular
notice
the
locus
classicus
about
mythology
the
tale
of
the
grasshoppers
the
first
passage
is
remarkable
as
showing
that
plato
was
entirely
free
from
what
may
be
termed
the
euhemerism
of
his
age
for
there
were
euhemerists
in
hellas
long
before
euhemerus
early
philosophers
like
anaxagoras
and
metrodorus
had
found
in
homer
and
mythology
hidden
meanings
plato
with
a
truer
instinct
rejects
these
attractive
interpretations
he
regards
the
inventor
of
them
as
and
they
draw
a
man
off
from
the
knowledge
of
himself
there
is
a
latent
criticism
and
also
a
poetical
sense
in
plato
which
enable
him
to
discard
them
and
yet
in
another
way
to
make
use
of
poetry
and
mythology
as
a
vehicle
of
thought
and
feeling
what
would
he
have
said
of
the
discovery
of
christian
doctrines
in
these
old
greek
legends
while
acknowledging
that
such
interpretations
are
nice
would
he
not
have
remarked
that
they
are
found
in
all
sacred
literatures
they
can
not
be
tested
by
any
criterion
of
truth
or
used
to
establish
any
truth
they
add
nothing
to
the
sum
of
human
knowledge
they
are
what
we
please
and
if
employed
as
between
the
new
and
old
are
liable
to
serious
misconstruction
as
he
elsewhere
remarks
republic
and
therefore
he
would
have
farewell
to
them
the
study
of
them
would
take
up
too
much
of
his
time
and
he
has
not
as
yet
learned
the
true
nature
of
religion
the
interest
of
phaedrus
the
little
touch
about
the
two
versions
of
the
story
the
ironical
manner
in
which
these
explanations
are
set
aside
common
opinion
about
them
is
enough
for
me
the
allusion
to
the
serpent
typho
may
be
noted
in
passing
also
the
general
agreement
between
the
tone
of
this
speech
and
the
remark
of
socrates
which
follows
afterwards
am
a
diviner
but
a
poor
one
the
tale
of
the
grasshoppers
is
naturally
suggested
by
the
surrounding
scene
they
are
also
the
representatives
of
the
athenians
as
children
of
the
soil
under
the
image
of
the
lively
chirruping
grasshoppers
who
inform
the
muses
in
heaven
about
those
who
honour
them
on
earth
plato
intends
to
represent
an
athenian
audience
tettigessin
eoikotes
the
story
is
introduced
apparently
to
mark
a
change
of
subject
and
also
like
several
other
allusions
which
occur
in
the
course
of
the
dialogue
in
order
to
preserve
the
scene
in
the
recollection
of
the
reader
no
one
can
duly
appreciate
the
dialogues
of
plato
especially
the
phaedrus
symposium
and
portions
of
the
republic
who
has
not
a
sympathy
with
mysticism
to
the
uninitiated
as
he
would
himself
have
acknowledged
they
will
appear
to
be
the
dreams
of
a
poet
who
is
disguised
as
a
philosopher
there
is
a
twofold
difficulty
in
apprehending
this
aspect
of
the
platonic
writings
first
we
do
not
immediately
realize
that
under
the
marble
exterior
of
greek
literature
was
concealed
a
soul
thrilling
with
spiritual
emotion
secondly
the
forms
or
figures
which
the
platonic
philosophy
assumes
are
not
like
the
images
of
the
prophet
isaiah
or
of
the
apocalypse
familiar
to
us
in
the
days
of
our
youth
by
mysticism
we
mean
not
the
extravagance
of
an
erring
fancy
but
the
concentration
of
reason
in
feeling
the
enthusiastic
love
of
the
good
the
true
the
one
the
sense
of
the
infinity
of
knowledge
and
of
the
marvel
of
the
human
faculties
when
feeding
upon
such
thoughts
the
of
the
soul
is
renewed
and
gains
strength
she
is
raised
above
manikins
of
earth
and
their
opinions
waiting
in
wonder
to
know
and
working
with
reverence
to
find
out
what
god
in
this
or
in
another
life
may
reveal
to
her
on
the
decline
of
greek
literature
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
plato
in
the
phaedrus
is
to
satirize
rhetoric
or
rather
the
professors
of
rhetoric
who
swarmed
at
athens
in
the
fourth
century
before
christ
as
in
the
opening
of
the
dialogue
he
ridicules
the
interpreters
of
mythology
as
in
the
protagoras
he
mocks
at
the
sophists
as
in
the
euthydemus
he
makes
fun
of
the
eristics
as
in
the
cratylus
he
ridicules
the
fancies
of
etymologers
as
in
the
meno
and
gorgias
and
some
other
dialogues
he
makes
reflections
and
casts
sly
imputation
upon
the
higher
classes
at
athens
so
in
the
phaedrus
chiefly
in
the
latter
part
he
aims
his
shafts
at
the
rhetoricians
the
profession
of
rhetoric
was
the
greatest
and
most
popular
in
athens
necessary
a
man
salvation
or
at
any
rate
to
his
attainment
of
wealth
or
power
but
plato
finds
nothing
wholesome
or
genuine
in
the
purpose
of
it
it
is
a
veritable
having
no
relation
to
fact
or
to
truth
of
any
kind
it
is
antipathetic
to
him
not
only
as
a
philosopher
but
also
as
a
great
writer
he
can
not
abide
the
tricks
of
the
rhetoricians
or
the
pedantries
and
mannerisms
which
they
introduce
into
speech
and
writing
he
sees
clearly
how
far
removed
they
are
from
the
ways
of
simplicity
and
truth
and
how
ignorant
of
the
very
elements
of
the
art
which
they
are
professing
to
teach
the
thing
which
is
most
necessary
of
all
the
knowledge
of
human
nature
is
hardly
if
at
all
considered
by
them
the
true
rules
of
composition
which
are
very
few
are
not
to
be
found
in
their
voluminous
systems
their
pretentiousness
their
omniscience
their
large
fortunes
their
impatience
of
argument
their
indifference
to
first
principles
their
stupidity
their
progresses
through
hellas
accompanied
by
a
troop
of
their
disciples
these
things
were
very
distasteful
to
plato
who
esteemed
genius
far
above
art
and
was
quite
sensible
of
the
interval
which
separated
them
phaedrus
it
is
the
interval
which
separates
sophists
and
rhetoricians
from
ancient
famous
men
and
women
such
as
homer
and
hesiod
anacreon
and
sappho
aeschylus
and
sophocles
and
the
platonic
socrates
is
afraid
that
if
he
approves
the
former
he
will
be
disowned
by
the
latter
the
spirit
of
rhetoric
was
soon
to
overspread
all
hellas
and
plato
with
prophetic
insight
may
have
seen
from
afar
the
great
literary
waste
or
dead
level
or
interminable
marsh
in
which
greek
literature
was
soon
to
disappear
a
similar
vision
of
the
decline
of
the
greek
drama
and
of
the
contrast
of
the
old
literature
and
the
new
was
present
to
the
mind
of
aristophanes
after
the
death
of
the
three
great
tragedians
frogs
after
about
a
hundred
or
at
most
two
hundred
years
if
we
exclude
homer
the
genius
of
hellas
had
ceased
to
flower
or
blossom
the
dreary
waste
which
follows
beginning
with
the
alexandrian
writers
and
even
before
them
in
the
platitudes
of
isocrates
and
his
school
spreads
over
much
more
than
a
thousand
years
and
from
this
decline
the
greek
language
and
literature
unlike
the
latin
which
has
come
to
life
in
new
forms
and
been
developed
into
the
great
european
languages
never
recovered
this
monotony
of
literature
without
merit
without
genius
and
without
character
is
a
phenomenon
which
deserves
more
attention
than
it
has
hitherto
received
it
is
a
phenomenon
unique
in
the
literary
history
of
the
world
how
could
there
have
been
so
much
cultivation
so
much
diligence
in
writing
and
so
little
mind
or
real
creative
power
why
did
a
thousand
years
invent
nothing
better
than
sibylline
books
orphic
poems
byzantine
imitations
of
classical
histories
christian
reproductions
of
greek
plays
novels
like
the
silly
and
obscene
romances
of
longus
and
heliodorus
innumerable
forged
epistles
a
great
many
epigrams
biographies
of
the
meanest
and
most
meagre
description
a
sham
philosophy
which
was
the
bastard
progeny
of
the
union
between
hellas
and
the
east
only
in
plutarch
in
lucian
in
longinus
in
the
roman
emperors
marcus
aurelius
and
julian
in
some
of
the
christian
fathers
are
there
any
traces
of
good
sense
or
originality
or
any
power
of
arousing
the
interest
of
later
ages
and
when
new
books
ceased
to
be
written
why
did
hosts
of
grammarians
and
interpreters
flock
in
who
never
attain
to
any
sound
notion
either
of
grammar
or
interpretation
why
did
the
physical
sciences
never
arrive
at
any
true
knowledge
or
make
any
real
progress
why
did
poetry
droop
and
languish
why
did
history
degenerate
into
fable
why
did
words
lose
their
power
of
expression
why
were
ages
of
external
greatness
and
magnificence
attended
by
all
the
signs
of
decay
in
the
human
mind
which
are
possible
to
these
questions
many
answers
may
be
given
which
if
not
the
true
causes
are
at
least
to
be
reckoned
among
the
symptoms
of
the
decline
there
is
the
want
of
method
in
physical
science
the
want
of
criticism
in
history
the
want
of
simplicity
or
delicacy
in
poetry
the
want
of
political
freedom
which
is
the
true
atmosphere
of
public
speaking
in
oratory
the
ways
of
life
were
luxurious
and
commonplace
philosophy
had
become
extravagant
eclectic
abstract
devoid
of
any
real
content
at
length
it
ceased
to
exist
it
had
spread
words
like
plaster
over
the
whole
field
of
knowledge
it
had
grown
ascetic
on
one
side
mystical
on
the
other
neither
of
these
tendencies
was
favourable
to
literature
there
was
no
sense
of
beauty
either
in
language
or
in
art
the
greek
world
became
vacant
barbaric
oriental
no
one
had
anything
new
to
say
or
any
conviction
of
truth
the
age
had
no
remembrance
of
the
past
no
power
of
understanding
what
other
ages
thought
and
felt
the
catholic
faith
had
degenerated
into
dogma
and
controversy
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
not
a
single
writer
of
or
even
of
reputation
has
a
place
in
the
innumerable
rolls
of
greek
literature
if
we
seek
to
go
deeper
we
can
still
only
describe
the
outward
nature
of
the
clouds
or
darkness
which
were
spread
over
the
heavens
during
so
many
ages
without
relief
or
light
we
may
say
that
this
like
several
other
long
periods
in
the
history
of
the
human
race
was
destitute
or
deprived
of
the
moral
qualities
which
are
the
root
of
literary
excellence
it
had
no
life
or
aspiration
no
national
or
political
force
no
desire
for
consistency
no
love
of
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
it
did
not
attempt
to
pierce
the
mists
which
surrounded
it
it
did
not
propose
to
itself
to
go
forward
and
scale
the
heights
of
knowledge
but
to
go
backwards
and
seek
at
the
beginning
what
can
only
be
found
towards
the
end
it
was
lost
in
doubt
and
ignorance
it
rested
upon
tradition
and
authority
it
had
none
of
the
higher
play
of
fancy
which
creates
poetry
and
where
there
is
no
true
poetry
neither
can
there
be
any
good
prose
it
had
no
great
characters
and
therefore
it
had
no
great
writers
it
was
incapable
of
distinguishing
between
words
and
things
it
was
so
hopelessly
below
the
ancient
standard
of
classical
greek
art
and
literature
that
it
had
no
power
of
understanding
or
of
valuing
them
it
is
doubtful
whether
any
greek
author
was
justly
appreciated
in
antiquity
except
by
his
own
contemporaries
and
this
neglect
of
the
great
authors
of
the
past
led
to
the
disappearance
of
the
larger
part
of
them
while
the
greek
fathers
were
mostly
preserved
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
in
the
century
before
the
taking
of
constantinople
much
more
was
in
existence
than
the
scholars
of
the
renaissance
carried
away
with
them
to
italy
the
character
of
greek
literature
sank
lower
as
time
went
on
it
consisted
more
and
more
of
compilations
of
scholia
of
extracts
of
commentaries
forgeries
imitations
the
commentator
or
interpreter
had
no
conception
of
his
author
as
a
whole
and
very
little
of
the
context
of
any
passage
which
he
was
explaining
the
least
things
were
preferred
by
him
to
the
greatest
the
question
of
a
reading
or
a
grammatical
form
or
an
accent
or
the
uses
of
a
word
took
the
place
of
the
aim
or
subject
of
the
book
he
had
no
sense
of
the
beauties
of
an
author
and
very
little
light
is
thrown
by
him
on
real
difficulties
he
interprets
past
ages
by
his
own
the
greatest
classical
writers
are
the
least
appreciated
by
him
this
seems
to
be
the
reason
why
so
many
of
them
have
perished
why
the
lyric
poets
have
almost
wholly
disappeared
why
out
of
the
eighty
or
ninety
tragedies
of
aeschylus
and
sophocles
only
seven
of
each
had
been
preserved
such
an
age
of
sciolism
and
scholasticism
may
possibly
once
more
get
the
better
of
the
literary
world
there
are
those
who
prophesy
that
the
signs
of
such
a
day
are
again
appearing
among
us
and
that
at
the
end
of
the
present
century
no
writer
of
the
first
class
will
be
still
alive
they
think
that
the
muse
of
literature
may
transfer
herself
to
other
countries
less
dried
up
or
worn
out
than
our
own
they
seem
to
see
the
withering
effect
of
criticism
on
original
genius
no
one
can
doubt
that
such
a
decay
or
decline
of
literature
and
of
art
seriously
affects
the
manners
and
character
of
a
nation
it
takes
away
half
the
joys
and
refinements
of
life
it
increases
its
dulness
and
grossness
hence
it
becomes
a
matter
of
great
interest
to
consider
how
if
at
all
such
a
degeneracy
may
be
averted
is
there
any
elixir
which
can
restore
life
and
youth
to
the
literature
of
a
nation
or
at
any
rate
which
can
prevent
it
becoming
unmanned
and
enfeebled
first
there
is
the
progress
of
education
it
is
possible
and
even
probable
that
the
extension
of
the
means
of
knowledge
over
a
wider
area
and
to
persons
living
under
new
conditions
may
lead
to
many
new
combinations
of
thought
and
language
but
as
yet
experience
does
not
favour
the
realization
of
such
a
hope
or
promise
it
may
be
truly
answered
that
at
present
the
training
of
teachers
and
the
methods
of
education
are
very
imperfect
and
therefore
that
we
can
not
judge
of
the
future
by
the
present
when
more
of
our
youth
are
trained
in
the
best
literatures
and
in
the
best
parts
of
them
their
minds
may
be
expected
to
have
a
larger
growth
they
will
have
more
interests
more
thoughts
more
material
for
conversation
they
will
have
a
higher
standard
and
begin
to
think
for
themselves
the
number
of
persons
who
will
have
the
opportunity
of
receiving
the
highest
education
through
the
cheap
press
and
by
the
help
of
high
schools
and
colleges
may
increase
tenfold
it
is
likely
that
in
every
thousand
persons
there
is
at
least
one
who
is
far
above
the
average
in
natural
capacity
but
the
seed
which
is
in
him
dies
for
want
of
cultivation
it
has
never
had
any
stimulus
to
grow
or
any
field
in
which
to
blossom
and
produce
fruit
here
is
a
great
reservoir
or
of
human
intelligence
out
of
which
new
waters
may
flow
and
cover
the
earth
if
at
any
time
the
great
men
of
the
world
should
die
out
and
originality
or
genius
appear
to
suffer
a
partial
eclipse
there
is
a
boundless
hope
in
the
multitude
of
intelligences
for
future
generations
they
may
bring
gifts
to
men
such
as
the
world
has
never
received
before
they
may
begin
at
a
higher
point
and
yet
take
with
them
all
the
results
of
the
past
the
of
many
may
have
effects
not
less
striking
though
different
in
character
from
those
which
the
creative
genius
of
a
single
man
such
as
bacon
or
newton
formerly
produced
there
is
also
great
hope
to
be
derived
not
merely
from
the
extension
of
education
over
a
wider
area
but
from
the
continuance
of
it
during
many
generations
educated
parents
will
have
children
fit
to
receive
education
and
these
again
will
grow
up
under
circumstances
far
more
favourable
to
the
growth
of
intelligence
than
any
which
have
hitherto
existed
in
our
own
or
in
former
ages
even
if
we
were
to
suppose
no
more
men
of
genius
to
be
produced
the
great
writers
of
ancient
or
of
modern
times
will
remain
to
furnish
abundant
materials
of
education
to
the
coming
generation
now
that
every
nation
holds
communication
with
every
other
we
may
truly
say
in
a
fuller
sense
than
formerly
that
thoughts
of
men
are
widened
with
the
process
of
the
suns
they
will
not
be
cabined
and
confined
within
a
province
or
an
island
the
east
will
provide
elements
of
culture
to
the
west
as
well
as
the
west
to
the
east
the
religions
and
literatures
of
the
world
will
be
open
books
which
he
who
wills
may
read
the
human
race
may
not
be
always
ground
down
by
bodily
toil
but
may
have
greater
leisure
for
the
improvement
of
the
mind
the
increasing
sense
of
the
greatness
and
infinity
of
nature
will
tend
to
awaken
in
men
larger
and
more
liberal
thoughts
the
love
of
mankind
may
be
the
source
of
a
greater
development
of
literature
than
nationality
has
ever
been
there
may
be
a
greater
freedom
from
prejudice
and
party
we
may
better
understand
the
whereabouts
of
truth
and
therefore
there
may
be
more
success
and
fewer
failures
in
the
search
for
it
lastly
in
the
coming
ages
we
shall
carry
with
us
the
recollection
of
the
past
in
which
are
necessarily
contained
many
seeds
of
revival
and
renaissance
in
the
future
so
far
is
the
world
from
becoming
exhausted
so
groundless
is
the
fear
that
literature
will
ever
die
out
phaedrus
persons
of
the
dialogue
socrates
phaedrus
scene
under
a
by
the
banks
of
the
ilissus
socrates
my
dear
phaedrus
whence
come
you
and
whither
are
you
going
phaedrus
i
come
from
lysias
the
son
of
cephalus
and
i
am
going
to
take
a
walk
outside
the
wall
for
i
have
been
sitting
with
him
the
whole
morning
and
our
common
friend
acumenus
tells
me
that
it
is
much
more
refreshing
to
walk
in
the
open
air
than
to
be
shut
up
in
a
cloister
socrates
there
he
is
right
lysias
then
i
suppose
was
in
the
town
phaedrus
yes
he
was
staying
with
epicrates
here
at
the
house
of
morychus
that
house
which
is
near
the
temple
of
olympian
zeus
socrates
and
how
did
he
entertain
you
can
i
be
wrong
in
supposing
that
lysias
gave
you
a
feast
of
discourse
phaedrus
you
shall
hear
if
you
can
spare
time
to
accompany
me
socrates
and
should
i
not
deem
the
conversation
of
you
and
lysias
thing
of
higher
import
as
i
may
say
in
the
words
of
pindar
any
business
phaedrus
will
you
go
on
socrates
and
will
you
go
on
with
the
narration
phaedrus
my
tale
socrates
is
one
of
your
sort
for
love
was
the
theme
which
occupied
us
love
after
a
fashion
lysias
has
been
writing
about
a
fair
youth
who
was
being
tempted
but
not
by
a
lover
and
this
was
the
point
he
ingeniously
proved
that
the
should
be
accepted
rather
than
the
lover
socrates
o
that
is
noble
of
him
i
wish
that
he
would
say
the
poor
man
rather
than
the
rich
and
the
old
man
rather
than
the
young
one
then
he
would
meet
the
case
of
me
and
of
many
a
man
his
words
would
be
quite
refreshing
and
he
would
be
a
public
benefactor
for
my
part
i
do
so
long
to
hear
his
speech
that
if
you
walk
all
the
way
to
megara
and
when
you
have
reached
the
wall
come
back
as
herodicus
recommends
without
going
in
i
will
keep
you
company
phaedrus
what
do
you
mean
my
good
socrates
how
can
you
imagine
that
my
unpractised
memory
can
do
justice
to
an
elaborate
work
which
the
greatest
rhetorician
of
the
age
spent
a
long
time
in
composing
indeed
i
can
not
i
would
give
a
great
deal
if
i
could
socrates
i
believe
that
i
know
phaedrus
about
as
well
as
i
know
myself
and
i
am
very
sure
that
the
speech
of
lysias
was
repeated
to
him
not
once
only
but
again
and
again
he
insisted
on
hearing
it
many
times
over
and
lysias
was
very
willing
to
gratify
him
at
last
when
nothing
else
would
do
he
got
hold
of
the
book
and
looked
at
what
he
most
wanted
to
see
this
occupied
him
during
the
whole
morning
and
then
when
he
was
tired
with
sitting
he
went
out
to
take
a
walk
not
until
by
the
dog
as
i
believe
he
had
simply
learned
by
heart
the
entire
discourse
unless
it
was
unusually
long
and
he
went
to
a
place
outside
the
wall
that
he
might
practise
his
lesson
there
he
saw
a
certain
lover
of
discourse
who
had
a
similar
weakness
he
saw
and
rejoiced
now
thought
he
shall
have
a
partner
in
my
revels
and
he
invited
him
to
come
and
walk
with
him
but
when
the
lover
of
discourse
begged
that
he
would
repeat
the
tale
he
gave
himself
airs
and
said
i
can
not
as
if
he
were
indisposed
although
if
the
hearer
had
refused
he
would
sooner
or
later
have
been
compelled
by
him
to
listen
whether
he
would
or
no
therefore
phaedrus
bid
him
do
at
once
what
he
will
soon
do
whether
bidden
or
not
phaedrus
i
see
that
you
will
not
let
me
off
until
i
speak
in
some
fashion
or
other
verily
therefore
my
best
plan
is
to
speak
as
i
best
can
socrates
a
very
true
remark
that
of
yours
phaedrus
i
will
do
as
i
say
but
believe
me
socrates
i
did
not
learn
the
very
words
o
no
nevertheless
i
have
a
general
notion
of
what
he
said
and
will
give
you
a
summary
of
the
points
in
which
the
lover
differed
from
the
let
me
begin
at
the
beginning
socrates
yes
my
sweet
one
but
you
must
first
of
all
show
what
you
have
in
your
left
hand
under
your
cloak
for
that
roll
as
i
suspect
is
the
actual
discourse
now
much
as
i
love
you
i
would
not
have
you
suppose
that
i
am
going
to
have
your
memory
exercised
at
my
expense
if
you
have
lysias
himself
here
phaedrus
enough
i
see
that
i
have
no
hope
of
practising
my
art
upon
you
but
if
i
am
to
read
where
would
you
please
to
sit
socrates
let
us
turn
aside
and
go
by
the
ilissus
we
will
sit
down
at
some
quiet
spot
phaedrus
i
am
fortunate
in
not
having
my
sandals
and
as
you
never
have
any
i
think
that
we
may
go
along
the
brook
and
cool
our
feet
in
the
water
this
will
be
the
easiest
way
and
at
midday
and
in
the
summer
is
far
from
being
unpleasant
socrates
lead
on
and
look
out
for
a
place
in
which
we
can
sit
down
phaedrus
do
you
see
the
tallest
in
the
distance
socrates
yes
phaedrus
there
are
shade
and
gentle
breezes
and
grass
on
which
we
may
either
sit
or
lie
down
socrates
move
forward
phaedrus
i
should
like
to
know
socrates
whether
the
place
is
not
somewhere
here
at
which
boreas
is
said
to
have
carried
off
orithyia
from
the
banks
of
the
ilissus
socrates
such
is
the
tradition
phaedrus
and
is
this
the
exact
spot
the
little
stream
is
delightfully
clear
and
bright
i
can
fancy
that
there
might
be
maidens
playing
near
socrates
i
believe
that
the
spot
is
not
exactly
here
but
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
lower
down
where
you
cross
to
the
temple
of
artemis
and
there
is
i
think
some
sort
of
an
altar
of
boreas
at
the
place
phaedrus
i
have
never
noticed
it
but
i
beseech
you
to
tell
me
socrates
do
you
believe
this
tale
socrates
the
wise
are
doubtful
and
i
should
not
be
singular
if
like
them
i
too
doubted
i
might
have
a
rational
explanation
that
orithyia
was
playing
with
pharmacia
when
a
northern
gust
carried
her
over
the
neighbouring
rocks
and
this
being
the
manner
of
her
death
she
was
said
to
have
been
carried
away
by
boreas
there
is
a
discrepancy
however
about
the
locality
according
to
another
version
of
the
story
she
was
taken
from
areopagus
and
not
from
this
place
now
i
quite
acknowledge
that
these
allegories
are
very
nice
but
he
is
not
to
be
envied
who
has
to
invent
them
much
labour
and
ingenuity
will
be
required
of
him
and
when
he
has
once
begun
he
must
go
on
and
rehabilitate
hippocentaurs
and
chimeras
dire
gorgons
and
winged
steeds
flow
in
apace
and
numberless
other
inconceivable
and
portentous
natures
and
if
he
is
sceptical
about
them
and
would
fain
reduce
them
one
after
another
to
the
rules
of
probability
this
sort
of
crude
philosophy
will
take
up
a
great
deal
of
time
now
i
have
no
leisure
for
such
enquiries
shall
i
tell
you
why
i
must
first
know
myself
as
the
delphian
inscription
says
to
be
curious
about
that
which
is
not
my
concern
while
i
am
still
in
ignorance
of
my
own
self
would
be
ridiculous
and
therefore
i
bid
farewell
to
all
this
the
common
opinion
is
enough
for
me
for
as
i
was
saying
i
want
to
know
not
about
this
but
about
myself
am
i
a
monster
more
complicated
and
swollen
with
passion
than
the
serpent
typho
or
a
creature
of
a
gentler
and
simpler
sort
to
whom
nature
has
given
a
diviner
and
lowlier
destiny
but
let
me
ask
you
friend
have
we
not
reached
the
to
which
you
were
conducting
us
phaedrus
yes
this
is
the
tree
socrates
by
here
a
fair
full
of
summer
sounds
and
scents
here
is
this
lofty
and
spreading
and
the
agnus
castus
high
and
clustering
in
the
fullest
blossom
and
the
greatest
fragrance
and
the
stream
which
flows
beneath
the
is
deliciously
cold
to
the
feet
judging
from
the
ornaments
and
images
this
must
be
a
spot
sacred
to
achelous
and
the
nymphs
how
delightful
is
the
breeze
so
very
sweet
and
there
is
a
sound
in
the
air
shrill
and
summerlike
which
makes
answer
to
the
chorus
of
the
cicadae
but
the
greatest
charm
of
all
is
the
grass
like
a
pillow
gently
sloping
to
the
head
my
dear
phaedrus
you
have
been
an
admirable
guide
phaedrus
what
an
incomprehensible
being
you
are
socrates
when
you
are
in
the
country
as
you
say
you
really
are
like
some
stranger
who
is
led
about
by
a
guide
do
you
ever
cross
the
border
i
rather
think
that
you
never
venture
even
outside
the
gates
socrates
very
true
my
good
friend
and
i
hope
that
you
will
excuse
me
when
you
hear
the
reason
which
is
that
i
am
a
lover
of
knowledge
and
the
men
who
dwell
in
the
city
are
my
teachers
and
not
the
trees
or
the
country
though
i
do
indeed
believe
that
you
have
found
a
spell
with
which
to
draw
me
out
of
the
city
into
the
country
like
a
hungry
cow
before
whom
a
bough
or
a
bunch
of
fruit
is
waved
for
only
hold
up
before
me
in
like
manner
a
book
and
you
may
lead
me
all
round
attica
and
over
the
wide
world
and
now
having
arrived
i
intend
to
lie
down
and
do
you
choose
any
posture
in
which
you
can
read
best
begin
phaedrus
listen
you
know
how
matters
stand
with
me
and
how
as
i
conceive
this
affair
may
be
arranged
for
the
advantage
of
both
of
us
and
i
maintain
that
i
ought
not
to
fail
in
my
suit
because
i
am
not
your
lover
for
lovers
repent
of
the
kindnesses
which
they
have
shown
when
their
passion
ceases
but
to
the
who
are
free
and
not
under
any
compulsion
no
time
of
repentance
ever
comes
for
they
confer
their
benefits
according
to
the
measure
of
their
ability
in
the
way
which
is
most
conducive
to
their
own
interest
then
again
lovers
consider
how
by
reason
of
their
love
they
have
neglected
their
own
concerns
and
rendered
service
to
others
and
when
to
these
benefits
conferred
they
add
on
the
troubles
which
they
have
endured
they
think
that
they
have
long
ago
made
to
the
beloved
a
very
ample
return
but
the
has
no
such
tormenting
recollections
he
has
never
neglected
his
affairs
or
quarrelled
with
his
relations
he
has
no
troubles
to
add
up
or
excuses
to
invent
and
being
well
rid
of
all
these
evils
why
should
he
not
freely
do
what
will
gratify
the
beloved
if
you
say
that
the
lover
is
more
to
be
esteemed
because
his
love
is
thought
to
be
greater
for
he
is
willing
to
say
and
do
what
is
hateful
to
other
men
in
order
to
please
his
beloved
that
if
true
is
only
a
proof
that
he
will
prefer
any
future
love
to
his
present
and
will
injure
his
old
love
at
the
pleasure
of
the
new
and
how
in
a
matter
of
such
infinite
importance
can
a
man
be
right
in
trusting
himself
to
one
who
is
afflicted
with
a
malady
which
no
experienced
person
would
attempt
to
cure
for
the
patient
himself
admits
that
he
is
not
in
his
right
mind
and
acknowledges
that
he
is
wrong
in
his
mind
but
says
that
he
is
unable
to
control
himself
and
if
he
came
to
his
right
mind
would
he
ever
imagine
that
the
desires
were
good
which
he
conceived
when
in
his
wrong
mind
once
more
there
are
many
more
than
lovers
and
if
you
choose
the
best
of
the
lovers
you
will
not
have
many
to
choose
from
but
if
from
the
the
choice
will
be
larger
and
you
will
be
far
more
likely
to
find
among
them
a
person
who
is
worthy
of
your
friendship
if
public
opinion
be
your
dread
and
you
would
avoid
reproach
in
all
probability
the
lover
who
is
always
thinking
that
other
men
are
as
emulous
of
him
as
he
is
of
them
will
boast
to
some
one
of
his
successes
and
make
a
show
of
them
openly
in
the
pride
of
his
heart
he
wants
others
to
know
that
his
labour
has
not
been
lost
but
the
is
more
his
own
master
and
is
desirous
of
solid
good
and
not
of
the
opinion
of
mankind
again
the
lover
may
be
generally
noted
or
seen
following
the
beloved
this
is
his
regular
occupation
and
whenever
they
are
observed
to
exchange
two
words
they
are
supposed
to
meet
about
some
affair
of
love
either
past
or
in
contemplation
but
when
meet
no
one
asks
the
reason
why
because
people
know
that
talking
to
another
is
natural
whether
friendship
or
mere
pleasure
be
the
motive
once
more
if
you
fear
the
fickleness
of
friendship
consider
that
in
any
other
case
a
quarrel
might
be
a
mutual
calamity
but
now
when
you
have
given
up
what
is
most
precious
to
you
you
will
be
the
greater
loser
and
therefore
you
will
have
more
reason
in
being
afraid
of
the
lover
for
his
vexations
are
many
and
he
is
always
fancying
that
every
one
is
leagued
against
him
wherefore
also
he
debars
his
beloved
from
society
he
will
not
have
you
intimate
with
the
wealthy
lest
they
should
exceed
him
in
wealth
or
with
men
of
education
lest
they
should
be
his
superiors
in
understanding
and
he
is
equally
afraid
of
anybody
influence
who
has
any
other
advantage
over
himself
if
he
can
persuade
you
to
break
with
them
you
are
left
without
a
friend
in
the
world
or
if
out
of
a
regard
to
your
own
interest
you
have
more
sense
than
to
comply
with
his
desire
you
will
have
to
quarrel
with
him
but
those
who
are
and
whose
success
in
love
is
the
reward
of
their
merit
will
not
be
jealous
of
the
companions
of
their
beloved
and
will
rather
hate
those
who
refuse
to
be
his
associates
thinking
that
their
favourite
is
slighted
by
the
latter
and
benefited
by
the
former
for
more
love
than
hatred
may
be
expected
to
come
to
him
out
of
his
friendship
with
others
many
lovers
too
have
loved
the
person
of
a
youth
before
they
knew
his
character
or
his
belongings
so
that
when
their
passion
has
passed
away
there
is
no
knowing
whether
they
will
continue
to
be
his
friends
whereas
in
the
case
of
who
were
always
friends
the
friendship
is
not
lessened
by
the
favours
granted
but
the
recollection
of
these
remains
with
them
and
is
an
earnest
of
good
things
to
come
further
i
say
that
you
are
likely
to
be
improved
by
me
whereas
the
lover
will
spoil
you
for
they
praise
your
words
and
actions
in
a
wrong
way
partly
because
they
are
afraid
of
offending
you
and
also
their
judgment
is
weakened
by
passion
such
are
the
feats
which
love
exhibits
he
makes
things
painful
to
the
disappointed
which
give
no
pain
to
others
he
compels
the
successful
lover
to
praise
what
ought
not
to
give
him
pleasure
and
therefore
the
beloved
is
to
be
pitied
rather
than
envied
but
if
you
listen
to
me
in
the
first
place
i
in
my
intercourse
with
you
shall
not
merely
regard
present
enjoyment
but
also
future
advantage
being
not
mastered
by
love
but
my
own
master
nor
for
small
causes
taking
violent
dislikes
but
even
when
the
cause
is
great
slowly
laying
up
little
wrath
unintentional
offences
i
shall
forgive
and
intentional
ones
i
shall
try
to
prevent
and
these
are
the
marks
of
a
friendship
which
will
last
do
you
think
that
a
lover
only
can
be
a
firm
friend
reflect
if
this
were
true
we
should
set
small
value
on
sons
or
fathers
or
mothers
nor
should
we
ever
have
loyal
friends
for
our
love
of
them
arises
not
from
passion
but
from
other
associations
further
if
we
ought
to
shower
favours
on
those
who
are
the
most
eager
suitors
on
that
principle
we
ought
always
to
do
good
not
to
the
most
virtuous
but
to
the
most
needy
for
they
are
the
persons
who
will
be
most
relieved
and
will
therefore
be
the
most
grateful
and
when
you
make
a
feast
you
should
invite
not
your
friend
but
the
beggar
and
the
empty
soul
for
they
will
love
you
and
attend
you
and
come
about
your
doors
and
will
be
the
best
pleased
and
the
most
grateful
and
will
invoke
many
a
blessing
on
your
head
yet
surely
you
ought
not
to
be
granting
favours
to
those
who
besiege
you
with
prayer
but
to
those
who
are
best
able
to
reward
you
nor
to
the
lover
only
but
to
those
who
are
worthy
of
love
nor
to
those
who
will
enjoy
the
bloom
of
your
youth
but
to
those
who
will
share
their
possessions
with
you
in
age
nor
to
those
who
having
succeeded
will
glory
in
their
success
to
others
but
to
those
who
will
be
modest
and
tell
no
tales
nor
to
those
who
care
about
you
for
a
moment
only
but
to
those
who
will
continue
your
friends
through
life
nor
to
those
who
when
their
passion
is
over
will
pick
a
quarrel
with
you
but
rather
to
those
who
when
the
charm
of
youth
has
left
you
will
show
their
own
virtue
remember
what
i
have
said
and
consider
yet
this
further
point
friends
admonish
the
lover
under
the
idea
that
his
way
of
life
is
bad
but
no
one
of
his
kindred
ever
yet
censured
the
or
thought
that
he
was
about
his
own
interests
you
will
ask
me
whether
i
propose
that
you
should
indulge
every
to
which
i
reply
that
not
even
the
lover
would
advise
you
to
indulge
all
lovers
for
the
indiscriminate
favour
is
less
esteemed
by
the
rational
recipient
and
less
easily
hidden
by
him
who
would
escape
the
censure
of
the
world
now
love
ought
to
be
for
the
advantage
of
both
parties
and
for
the
injury
of
neither
believe
that
i
have
said
enough
but
if
there
is
anything
more
which
you
desire
or
which
in
your
opinion
needs
to
be
supplied
ask
and
i
will
answer
now
socrates
what
do
you
think
is
not
the
discourse
excellent
more
especially
in
the
matter
of
the
language
socrates
yes
quite
admirable
the
effect
on
me
was
ravishing
and
this
i
owe
to
you
phaedrus
for
i
observed
you
while
reading
to
be
in
an
ecstasy
and
thinking
that
you
are
more
experienced
in
these
matters
than
i
am
i
followed
your
example
and
like
you
my
divine
darling
i
became
inspired
with
a
phrenzy
phaedrus
indeed
you
are
pleased
to
be
merry
socrates
do
you
mean
that
i
am
not
in
earnest
phaedrus
now
do
talk
in
that
way
socrates
but
let
me
have
your
real
opinion
i
adjure
you
by
zeus
the
god
of
friendship
to
tell
me
whether
you
think
that
any
hellene
could
have
said
more
or
spoken
better
on
the
same
subject
socrates
well
but
are
you
and
i
expected
to
praise
the
sentiments
of
the
author
or
only
the
clearness
and
roundness
and
finish
and
tournure
of
the
language
as
to
the
first
i
willingly
submit
to
your
better
judgment
for
i
am
not
worthy
to
form
an
opinion
having
only
attended
to
the
rhetorical
manner
and
i
was
doubting
whether
this
could
have
been
defended
even
by
lysias
himself
i
thought
though
i
speak
under
correction
that
he
repeated
himself
two
or
three
times
either
from
want
of
words
or
from
want
of
pains
and
also
he
appeared
to
me
ostentatiously
to
exult
in
showing
how
well
he
could
say
the
same
thing
in
two
or
three
ways
phaedrus
nonsense
socrates
what
you
call
repetition
was
the
especial
merit
of
the
speech
for
he
omitted
no
topic
of
which
the
subject
rightly
allowed
and
i
do
not
think
that
any
one
could
have
spoken
better
or
more
exhaustively
socrates
there
i
can
not
go
along
with
you
ancient
sages
men
and
women
who
have
spoken
and
written
of
these
things
would
rise
up
in
judgment
against
me
if
out
of
complaisance
i
assented
to
you
phaedrus
who
are
they
and
where
did
you
hear
anything
better
than
this
socrates
i
am
sure
that
i
must
have
heard
but
at
this
moment
i
do
not
remember
from
whom
perhaps
from
sappho
the
fair
or
anacreon
the
wise
or
possibly
from
a
prose
writer
why
do
i
say
so
why
because
i
perceive
that
my
bosom
is
full
and
that
i
could
make
another
speech
as
good
as
that
of
lysias
and
different
now
i
am
certain
that
this
is
not
an
invention
of
my
own
who
am
well
aware
that
i
know
nothing
and
therefore
i
can
only
infer
that
i
have
been
filled
through
the
ears
like
a
pitcher
from
the
waters
of
another
though
i
have
actually
forgotten
in
my
stupidity
who
was
my
informant
phaedrus
that
is
grand
but
never
mind
where
you
heard
the
discourse
or
from
whom
let
that
be
a
mystery
not
to
be
divulged
even
at
my
earnest
desire
only
as
you
say
promise
to
make
another
and
better
oration
equal
in
length
and
entirely
new
on
the
same
subject
and
i
like
the
nine
archons
will
promise
to
set
up
a
golden
image
at
delphi
not
only
of
myself
but
of
you
and
as
large
as
life
socrates
you
are
a
dear
golden
ass
if
you
suppose
me
to
mean
that
lysias
has
altogether
missed
the
mark
and
that
i
can
make
a
speech
from
which
all
his
arguments
are
to
be
excluded
the
worst
of
authors
will
say
something
which
is
to
the
point
who
for
example
could
speak
on
this
thesis
of
yours
without
praising
the
discretion
of
the
and
blaming
the
indiscretion
of
the
lover
these
are
the
commonplaces
of
the
subject
which
must
come
in
for
what
else
is
there
to
be
said
and
must
be
allowed
and
excused
the
only
merit
is
in
the
arrangement
of
them
for
there
can
be
none
in
the
invention
but
when
you
leave
the
commonplaces
then
there
may
be
some
originality
phaedrus
i
admit
that
there
is
reason
in
what
you
say
and
i
too
will
be
reasonable
and
will
allow
you
to
start
with
the
premiss
that
the
lover
is
more
disordered
in
his
wits
than
the
if
in
what
remains
you
make
a
longer
and
better
speech
than
lysias
and
use
other
arguments
then
i
say
again
that
a
statue
you
shall
have
of
beaten
gold
and
take
your
place
by
the
colossal
offerings
of
the
cypselids
at
olympia
socrates
how
profoundly
in
earnest
is
the
lover
because
to
tease
him
i
lay
a
finger
upon
his
love
and
so
phaedrus
you
really
imagine
that
i
am
going
to
improve
upon
the
ingenuity
of
lysias
phaedrus
there
i
have
you
as
you
had
me
and
you
must
just
speak
you
best
can
do
not
let
us
exchange
quoque
as
in
a
farce
or
compel
me
to
say
to
you
as
you
said
to
me
know
socrates
as
well
as
i
know
myself
and
he
was
wanting
to
speak
but
he
gave
himself
airs
rather
i
would
have
you
consider
that
from
this
place
we
stir
not
until
you
have
unbosomed
yourself
of
the
speech
for
here
are
we
all
alone
and
i
am
stronger
remember
and
younger
than
you
wherefore
perpend
and
do
not
compel
me
to
use
violence
socrates
but
my
sweet
phaedrus
how
ridiculous
it
would
be
of
me
to
compete
with
lysias
in
an
extempore
speech
he
is
a
master
in
his
art
and
i
am
an
untaught
man
phaedrus
you
see
how
matters
stand
and
therefore
let
there
be
no
more
pretences
for
indeed
i
know
the
word
that
is
irresistible
socrates
then
do
say
it
phaedrus
yes
but
i
will
and
my
word
shall
be
an
oath
say
or
rather
swear
but
what
god
will
be
witness
of
my
oath
this
i
swear
that
unless
you
repeat
the
discourse
here
in
the
face
of
this
very
i
will
never
tell
you
another
never
let
you
have
word
of
another
socrates
villain
i
am
conquered
the
poor
lover
of
discourse
has
no
more
to
say
phaedrus
then
why
are
you
still
at
your
tricks
socrates
i
am
not
going
to
play
tricks
now
that
you
have
taken
the
oath
for
i
can
not
allow
myself
to
be
starved
phaedrus
proceed
socrates
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
phaedrus
what
socrates
i
will
veil
my
face
and
gallop
through
the
discourse
as
fast
as
i
can
for
if
i
see
you
i
shall
feel
ashamed
and
not
know
what
to
say
phaedrus
only
go
on
and
you
may
do
anything
else
which
you
please
socrates
come
o
ye
muses
melodious
as
ye
are
called
whether
you
have
received
this
name
from
the
character
of
your
strains
or
because
the
melians
are
a
musical
race
help
o
help
me
in
the
tale
which
my
good
friend
here
desires
me
to
rehearse
in
order
that
his
friend
whom
he
always
deemed
wise
may
seem
to
him
to
be
wiser
than
ever
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
fair
boy
or
more
properly
speaking
a
youth
he
was
very
fair
and
had
a
great
many
lovers
and
there
was
one
special
cunning
one
who
had
persuaded
the
youth
that
he
did
not
love
him
but
he
really
loved
him
all
the
same
and
one
day
when
he
was
paying
his
addresses
to
him
he
used
this
very
argument
that
he
ought
to
accept
the
rather
than
the
lover
his
words
were
as
follows
good
counsel
begins
in
the
same
way
a
man
should
know
what
he
is
advising
about
or
his
counsel
will
all
come
to
nought
but
people
imagine
that
they
know
about
the
nature
of
things
when
they
do
know
about
them
and
not
having
come
to
an
understanding
at
first
because
they
think
that
they
know
they
end
as
might
be
expected
in
contradicting
one
another
and
themselves
now
you
and
i
must
not
be
guilty
of
this
fundamental
error
which
we
condemn
in
others
but
as
our
question
is
whether
the
lover
or
is
to
be
preferred
let
us
first
of
all
agree
in
defining
the
nature
and
power
of
love
and
then
keeping
our
eyes
upon
the
definition
and
to
this
appealing
let
us
further
enquire
whether
love
brings
advantage
or
disadvantage
one
sees
that
love
is
a
desire
and
we
know
also
that
desire
the
beautiful
and
good
now
in
what
way
is
the
lover
to
be
distinguished
from
the
let
us
note
that
in
every
one
of
us
there
are
two
guiding
and
ruling
principles
which
lead
us
whither
they
will
one
is
the
natural
desire
of
pleasure
the
other
is
an
acquired
opinion
which
aspires
after
the
best
and
these
two
are
sometimes
in
harmony
and
then
again
at
war
and
sometimes
the
one
sometimes
the
other
conquers
when
opinion
by
the
help
of
reason
leads
us
to
the
best
the
conquering
principle
is
called
temperance
but
when
desire
which
is
devoid
of
reason
rules
in
us
and
drags
us
to
pleasure
that
power
of
misrule
is
called
excess
now
excess
has
many
names
and
many
members
and
many
forms
and
any
of
these
forms
when
very
marked
gives
a
name
neither
honourable
nor
creditable
to
the
bearer
of
the
name
the
desire
of
eating
for
example
which
gets
the
better
of
the
higher
reason
and
the
other
desires
is
called
gluttony
and
he
who
is
possessed
by
it
is
called
a
glutton
the
tyrannical
desire
of
drink
which
inclines
the
possessor
of
the
desire
to
drink
has
a
name
which
is
only
too
obvious
and
there
can
be
as
little
doubt
by
what
name
any
other
appetite
of
the
same
family
would
be
called
it
will
be
the
name
of
that
which
happens
to
be
dominant
and
now
i
think
that
you
will
perceive
the
drift
of
my
discourse
but
as
every
spoken
word
is
in
a
manner
plainer
than
the
unspoken
i
had
better
say
further
that
the
irrational
desire
which
overcomes
the
tendency
of
opinion
towards
right
and
is
led
away
to
the
enjoyment
of
beauty
and
especially
of
personal
beauty
by
the
desires
which
are
her
own
kindred
that
supreme
desire
i
say
which
by
leading
conquers
and
by
the
force
of
passion
is
reinforced
from
this
very
force
receiving
a
name
is
called
love
erromenos
eros
and
now
dear
phaedrus
i
shall
pause
for
an
instant
to
ask
whether
you
do
not
think
me
as
i
appear
to
myself
inspired
phaedrus
yes
socrates
you
seem
to
have
a
very
unusual
flow
of
words
socrates
listen
to
me
then
in
silence
for
surely
the
place
is
holy
so
that
you
must
not
wonder
if
as
i
proceed
i
appear
to
be
in
a
divine
fury
for
already
i
am
getting
into
dithyrambics
phaedrus
nothing
can
be
truer
socrates
the
responsibility
rests
with
you
but
hear
what
follows
and
perhaps
the
fit
may
be
averted
all
is
in
their
hands
above
i
will
go
on
talking
to
my
youth
listen
thus
my
friend
we
have
declared
and
defined
the
nature
of
the
subject
keeping
the
definition
in
view
let
us
now
enquire
what
advantage
or
disadvantage
is
likely
to
ensue
from
the
lover
or
the
to
him
who
accepts
their
advances
he
who
is
the
victim
of
his
passions
and
the
slave
of
pleasure
will
of
course
desire
to
make
his
beloved
as
agreeable
to
himself
as
possible
now
to
him
who
has
a
mind
diseased
anything
is
agreeable
which
is
not
opposed
to
him
but
that
which
is
equal
or
superior
is
hateful
to
him
and
therefore
the
lover
will
not
brook
any
superiority
or
equality
on
the
part
of
his
beloved
he
is
always
employed
in
reducing
him
to
inferiority
and
the
ignorant
is
the
inferior
of
the
wise
the
coward
of
the
brave
the
slow
of
speech
of
the
speaker
the
dull
of
the
clever
these
and
not
these
only
are
the
mental
defects
of
the
beloved
defects
which
when
implanted
by
nature
are
necessarily
a
delight
to
the
lover
and
when
not
implanted
he
must
contrive
to
implant
them
in
him
if
he
would
not
be
deprived
of
his
fleeting
joy
and
therefore
he
can
not
help
being
jealous
and
will
debar
his
beloved
from
the
advantages
of
society
which
would
make
a
man
of
him
and
especially
from
that
society
which
would
have
given
him
wisdom
and
thereby
he
can
not
fail
to
do
him
great
harm
that
is
to
say
in
his
excessive
fear
lest
he
should
come
to
be
despised
in
his
eyes
he
will
be
compelled
to
banish
from
him
divine
philosophy
and
there
is
no
greater
injury
which
he
can
inflict
upon
him
than
this
he
will
contrive
that
his
beloved
shall
be
wholly
ignorant
and
in
everything
shall
look
to
him
he
is
to
be
the
delight
of
the
lover
heart
and
a
curse
to
himself
verily
a
lover
is
a
profitable
guardian
and
associate
for
him
in
all
that
relates
to
his
mind
let
us
next
see
how
his
master
whose
law
of
life
is
pleasure
and
not
good
will
keep
and
train
the
body
of
his
servant
will
he
not
choose
a
beloved
who
is
delicate
rather
than
sturdy
and
strong
one
brought
up
in
shady
bowers
and
not
in
the
bright
sun
a
stranger
to
manly
exercises
and
the
sweat
of
toil
accustomed
only
to
a
soft
and
luxurious
diet
instead
of
the
hues
of
health
having
the
colours
of
paint
and
ornament
and
the
rest
of
a
piece
such
a
life
as
any
one
can
imagine
and
which
i
need
not
detail
at
length
but
i
may
sum
up
all
that
i
have
to
say
in
a
word
and
pass
on
such
a
person
in
war
or
in
any
of
the
great
crises
of
life
will
be
the
anxiety
of
his
friends
and
also
of
his
lover
and
certainly
not
the
terror
of
his
enemies
which
nobody
can
deny
and
now
let
us
tell
what
advantage
or
disadvantage
the
beloved
will
receive
from
the
guardianship
and
society
of
his
lover
in
the
matter
of
his
property
this
is
the
next
point
to
be
considered
the
lover
will
be
the
first
to
see
what
indeed
will
be
sufficiently
evident
to
all
men
that
he
desires
above
all
things
to
deprive
his
beloved
of
his
dearest
and
best
and
holiest
possessions
father
mother
kindred
friends
of
all
whom
he
thinks
may
be
hinderers
or
reprovers
of
their
most
sweet
converse
he
will
even
cast
a
jealous
eye
upon
his
gold
and
silver
or
other
property
because
these
make
him
a
less
easy
prey
and
when
caught
less
manageable
hence
he
is
of
necessity
displeased
at
his
possession
of
them
and
rejoices
at
their
loss
and
he
would
like
him
to
be
wifeless
childless
homeless
as
well
and
the
longer
the
better
for
the
longer
he
is
all
this
the
longer
he
will
enjoy
him
there
are
some
sort
of
animals
such
as
flatterers
who
are
dangerous
and
mischievous
enough
and
yet
nature
has
mingled
a
temporary
pleasure
and
grace
in
their
composition
you
may
say
that
a
courtesan
is
hurtful
and
disapprove
of
such
creatures
and
their
practices
and
yet
for
the
time
they
are
very
pleasant
but
the
lover
is
not
only
hurtful
to
his
love
he
is
also
an
extremely
disagreeable
companion
the
old
proverb
says
that
of
a
feather
flock
together
i
suppose
that
equality
of
years
inclines
them
to
the
same
pleasures
and
similarity
begets
friendship
yet
you
may
have
more
than
enough
even
of
this
and
verily
constraint
is
always
said
to
be
grievous
now
the
lover
is
not
only
unlike
his
beloved
but
he
forces
himself
upon
him
for
he
is
old
and
his
love
is
young
and
neither
day
nor
night
will
he
leave
him
if
he
can
help
necessity
and
the
sting
of
desire
drive
him
on
and
allure
him
with
the
pleasure
which
he
receives
from
seeing
hearing
touching
perceiving
him
in
every
way
and
therefore
he
is
delighted
to
fasten
upon
him
and
to
minister
to
him
but
what
pleasure
or
consolation
can
the
beloved
be
receiving
all
this
time
must
he
not
feel
the
extremity
of
disgust
when
he
looks
at
an
old
shrivelled
face
and
the
remainder
to
match
which
even
in
a
description
is
disagreeable
and
quite
detestable
when
he
is
forced
into
daily
contact
with
his
lover
moreover
he
is
jealously
watched
and
guarded
against
everything
and
everybody
and
has
to
hear
misplaced
and
exaggerated
praises
of
himself
and
censures
equally
inappropriate
which
are
intolerable
when
the
man
is
sober
and
besides
being
intolerable
are
published
all
over
the
world
in
all
their
indelicacy
and
wearisomeness
when
he
is
drunk
and
not
only
while
his
love
continues
is
he
mischievous
and
unpleasant
but
when
his
love
ceases
he
becomes
a
perfidious
enemy
of
him
on
whom
he
showered
his
oaths
and
prayers
and
promises
and
yet
could
hardly
prevail
upon
him
to
tolerate
the
tedium
of
his
company
even
from
motives
of
interest
the
hour
of
payment
arrives
and
now
he
is
the
servant
of
another
master
instead
of
love
and
infatuation
wisdom
and
temperance
are
his
bosom
lords
but
the
beloved
has
not
discovered
the
change
which
has
taken
place
in
him
when
he
asks
for
a
return
and
recalls
to
his
recollection
former
sayings
and
doings
he
believes
himself
to
be
speaking
to
the
same
person
and
the
other
not
having
the
courage
to
confess
the
truth
and
not
knowing
how
to
fulfil
the
oaths
and
promises
which
he
made
when
under
the
dominion
of
folly
and
having
now
grown
wise
and
temperate
does
not
want
to
do
as
he
did
or
to
be
as
he
was
before
and
so
he
runs
away
and
is
constrained
to
be
a
defaulter
the
in
allusion
to
a
game
in
which
two
parties
fled
or
pursued
according
as
an
which
was
thrown
into
the
air
fell
with
the
dark
or
light
side
uppermost
has
fallen
with
the
other
side
uppermost
he
changes
pursuit
into
flight
while
the
other
is
compelled
to
follow
him
with
passion
and
imprecation
not
knowing
that
he
ought
never
from
the
first
to
have
accepted
a
demented
lover
instead
of
a
sensible
and
that
in
making
such
a
choice
he
was
giving
himself
up
to
a
faithless
morose
envious
disagreeable
being
hurtful
to
his
estate
hurtful
to
his
bodily
health
and
still
more
hurtful
to
the
cultivation
of
his
mind
than
which
there
neither
is
nor
ever
will
be
anything
more
honoured
in
the
eyes
both
of
gods
and
men
consider
this
fair
youth
and
know
that
in
the
friendship
of
the
lover
there
is
no
real
kindness
he
has
an
appetite
and
wants
to
feed
upon
you
wolves
love
lambs
so
lovers
love
their
loves
but
i
told
you
so
i
am
speaking
in
verse
and
therefore
i
had
better
make
an
end
enough
phaedrus
i
thought
that
you
were
only
and
were
going
to
make
a
similar
speech
about
all
the
advantages
of
accepting
the
why
do
you
not
proceed
socrates
does
not
your
simplicity
observe
that
i
have
got
out
of
dithyrambics
into
heroics
when
only
uttering
a
censure
on
the
lover
and
if
i
am
to
add
the
praises
of
the
what
will
become
of
me
do
you
not
perceive
that
i
am
already
overtaken
by
the
nymphs
to
whom
you
have
mischievously
exposed
me
and
therefore
i
will
only
add
that
the
has
all
the
advantages
in
which
the
lover
is
accused
of
being
deficient
and
now
i
will
say
no
more
there
has
been
enough
of
both
of
them
leaving
the
tale
to
its
fate
i
will
cross
the
river
and
make
the
best
of
my
way
home
lest
a
worse
thing
be
inflicted
upon
me
by
you
phaedrus
not
yet
socrates
not
until
the
heat
of
the
day
has
passed
do
you
not
see
that
the
hour
is
almost
noon
there
is
the
midday
sun
standing
still
as
people
say
in
the
meridian
let
us
rather
stay
and
talk
over
what
has
been
said
and
then
return
in
the
cool
socrates
your
love
of
discourse
phaedrus
is
superhuman
simply
marvellous
and
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
one
of
your
contemporaries
who
has
either
made
or
in
one
way
or
another
has
compelled
others
to
make
an
equal
number
of
speeches
i
would
except
simmias
the
theban
but
all
the
rest
are
far
behind
you
and
now
i
do
verily
believe
that
you
have
been
the
cause
of
another
phaedrus
that
is
good
news
but
what
do
you
mean
socrates
i
mean
to
say
that
as
i
was
about
to
cross
the
stream
the
usual
sign
was
given
to
me
that
sign
which
always
forbids
but
never
bids
me
to
do
anything
which
i
am
going
to
do
and
i
thought
that
i
heard
a
voice
saying
in
my
ear
that
i
had
been
guilty
of
impiety
and
that
i
must
not
go
away
until
i
had
made
an
atonement
now
i
am
a
diviner
though
not
a
very
good
one
but
i
have
enough
religion
for
my
own
use
as
you
might
say
of
a
bad
writer
his
writing
is
good
enough
for
him
and
i
am
beginning
to
see
that
i
was
in
error
o
my
friend
how
prophetic
is
the
human
soul
at
the
time
i
had
a
sort
of
misgiving
and
like
ibycus
was
troubled
i
feared
that
i
might
be
buying
honour
from
men
at
the
price
of
sinning
against
the
gods
now
i
recognize
my
error
phaedrus
what
error
socrates
that
was
a
dreadful
speech
which
you
brought
with
you
and
you
made
me
utter
one
as
bad
phaedrus
how
so
socrates
it
was
foolish
i
say
to
a
certain
extent
impious
can
anything
be
more
dreadful
phaedrus
nothing
if
the
speech
was
really
such
as
you
describe
socrates
well
and
is
not
eros
the
son
of
aphrodite
and
a
god
phaedrus
so
men
say
socrates
but
that
was
not
acknowledged
by
lysias
in
his
speech
nor
by
you
in
that
other
speech
which
you
by
a
charm
drew
from
my
lips
for
if
love
be
as
he
surely
is
a
divinity
he
can
not
be
evil
yet
this
was
the
error
of
both
the
speeches
there
was
also
a
simplicity
about
them
which
was
refreshing
having
no
truth
or
honesty
in
them
nevertheless
they
pretended
to
be
something
hoping
to
succeed
in
deceiving
the
manikins
of
earth
and
gain
celebrity
among
them
wherefore
i
must
have
a
purgation
and
i
bethink
me
of
an
ancient
purgation
of
mythological
error
which
was
devised
not
by
homer
for
he
never
had
the
wit
to
discover
why
he
was
blind
but
by
stesichorus
who
was
a
philosopher
and
knew
the
reason
why
and
therefore
when
he
lost
his
eyes
for
that
was
the
penalty
which
was
inflicted
upon
him
for
reviling
the
lovely
helen
he
at
once
purged
himself
and
the
purgation
was
a
recantation
which
began
thus
is
that
word
of
mine
the
truth
is
that
thou
didst
not
embark
in
ships
nor
ever
go
to
the
walls
of
troy
and
when
he
had
completed
his
poem
which
is
called
recantation
immediately
his
sight
returned
to
him
now
i
will
be
wiser
than
either
stesichorus
or
homer
in
that
i
am
going
to
make
my
recantation
for
reviling
love
before
i
suffer
and
this
i
will
attempt
not
as
before
veiled
and
ashamed
but
with
forehead
bold
and
bare
phaedrus
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
to
me
than
to
hear
you
say
so
socrates
only
think
my
good
phaedrus
what
an
utter
want
of
delicacy
was
shown
in
the
two
discourses
i
mean
in
my
own
and
in
that
which
you
recited
out
of
the
book
would
not
any
one
who
was
himself
of
a
noble
and
gentle
nature
and
who
loved
or
ever
had
loved
a
nature
like
his
own
when
we
tell
of
the
petty
causes
of
lovers
jealousies
and
of
their
exceeding
animosities
and
of
the
injuries
which
they
do
to
their
beloved
have
imagined
that
our
ideas
of
love
were
taken
from
some
haunt
of
sailors
to
which
good
manners
were
unknown
he
would
certainly
never
have
admitted
the
justice
of
our
censure
phaedrus
i
dare
say
not
socrates
socrates
therefore
because
i
blush
at
the
thought
of
this
person
and
also
because
i
am
afraid
of
love
himself
i
desire
to
wash
the
brine
out
of
my
ears
with
water
from
the
spring
and
i
would
counsel
lysias
not
to
delay
but
to
write
another
discourse
which
shall
prove
that
paribus
the
lover
ought
to
be
accepted
rather
than
the
phaedrus
be
assured
that
he
shall
you
shall
speak
the
praises
of
the
lover
and
lysias
shall
be
compelled
by
me
to
write
another
discourse
on
the
same
theme
socrates
you
will
be
true
to
your
nature
in
that
and
therefore
i
believe
you
phaedrus
speak
and
fear
not
socrates
but
where
is
the
fair
youth
whom
i
was
addressing
before
and
who
ought
to
listen
now
lest
if
he
hear
me
not
he
should
accept
a
before
he
knows
what
he
is
doing
phaedrus
he
is
close
at
hand
and
always
at
your
service
socrates
know
then
fair
youth
that
the
former
discourse
was
the
word
of
phaedrus
the
son
of
vain
man
who
dwells
in
the
city
of
myrrhina
myrrhinusius
and
this
which
i
am
about
to
utter
is
the
recantation
of
stesichorus
the
son
of
godly
man
euphemus
who
comes
from
the
town
of
desire
himera
and
is
to
the
following
effect
told
a
lie
when
i
said
that
the
beloved
ought
to
accept
the
when
he
might
have
the
lover
because
the
one
is
sane
and
the
other
mad
it
might
be
so
if
madness
were
simply
an
evil
but
there
is
also
a
madness
which
is
a
divine
gift
and
the
source
of
the
chiefest
blessings
granted
to
men
for
prophecy
is
a
madness
and
the
prophetess
at
delphi
and
the
priestesses
at
dodona
when
out
of
their
senses
have
conferred
great
benefits
on
hellas
both
in
public
and
private
life
but
when
in
their
senses
few
or
none
and
i
might
also
tell
you
how
the
sibyl
and
other
inspired
persons
have
given
to
many
an
one
many
an
intimation
of
the
future
which
has
saved
them
from
falling
but
it
would
be
tedious
to
speak
of
what
every
one
knows
there
will
be
more
reason
in
appealing
to
the
ancient
inventors
of
names
compare
cratylus
who
would
never
have
connected
prophecy
mantike
which
foretells
the
future
and
is
the
noblest
of
arts
with
madness
manike
or
called
them
both
by
the
same
name
if
they
had
deemed
madness
to
be
a
disgrace
or
dishonour
they
must
have
thought
that
there
was
an
inspired
madness
which
was
a
noble
thing
for
the
two
words
mantike
and
manike
are
really
the
same
and
the
letter
tau
is
only
a
modern
and
tasteless
insertion
and
this
is
confirmed
by
the
name
which
was
given
by
them
to
the
rational
investigation
of
futurity
whether
made
by
the
help
of
birds
or
of
other
signs
this
for
as
much
as
it
is
an
art
which
supplies
from
the
reasoning
faculty
mind
nous
and
information
istoria
to
human
thought
oiesis
they
originally
termed
oionoistike
but
the
word
has
been
lately
altered
and
made
sonorous
by
the
modern
introduction
of
the
letter
omega
oionoistike
and
oionistike
and
in
proportion
as
prophecy
mantike
is
more
perfect
and
august
than
augury
both
in
name
and
fact
in
the
same
proportion
as
the
ancients
testify
is
madness
superior
to
a
sane
mind
sophrosune
for
the
one
is
only
of
human
but
the
other
of
divine
origin
again
where
plagues
and
mightiest
woes
have
bred
in
certain
families
owing
to
some
ancient
there
madness
has
entered
with
holy
prayers
and
rites
and
by
inspired
utterances
found
a
way
of
deliverance
for
those
who
are
in
need
and
he
who
has
part
in
this
gift
and
is
truly
possessed
and
duly
out
of
his
mind
is
by
the
use
of
purifications
and
mysteries
made
whole
and
exempt
from
evil
future
as
well
as
present
and
has
a
release
from
the
calamity
which
was
afflicting
him
the
third
kind
is
the
madness
of
those
who
are
possessed
by
the
muses
which
taking
hold
of
a
delicate
and
virgin
soul
and
there
inspiring
frenzy
awakens
lyrical
and
all
other
numbers
with
these
adorning
the
myriad
actions
of
ancient
heroes
for
the
instruction
of
posterity
but
he
who
having
no
touch
of
the
muses
madness
in
his
soul
comes
to
the
door
and
thinks
that
he
will
get
into
the
temple
by
the
help
of
art
he
i
say
and
his
poetry
are
not
admitted
the
sane
man
disappears
and
is
nowhere
when
he
enters
into
rivalry
with
the
madman
i
might
tell
of
many
other
noble
deeds
which
have
sprung
from
inspired
madness
and
therefore
let
no
one
frighten
or
flutter
us
by
saying
that
the
temperate
friend
is
to
be
chosen
rather
than
the
inspired
but
let
him
further
show
that
love
is
not
sent
by
the
gods
for
any
good
to
lover
or
beloved
if
he
can
do
so
we
will
allow
him
to
carry
off
the
palm
and
we
on
our
part
will
prove
in
answer
to
him
that
the
madness
of
love
is
the
greatest
of
heaven
blessings
and
the
proof
shall
be
one
which
the
wise
will
receive
and
the
witling
disbelieve
but
first
of
all
let
us
view
the
affections
and
actions
of
the
soul
divine
and
human
and
try
to
ascertain
the
truth
about
them
the
beginning
of
our
proof
is
as
follows
translated
by
cic
tus
quaest
the
soul
through
all
her
being
is
immortal
for
that
which
is
ever
in
motion
is
immortal
but
that
which
moves
another
and
is
moved
by
another
in
ceasing
to
move
ceases
also
to
live
only
the
never
leaving
self
never
ceases
to
move
and
is
the
fountain
and
beginning
of
motion
to
all
that
moves
besides
now
the
beginning
is
unbegotten
for
that
which
is
begotten
has
a
beginning
but
the
beginning
is
begotten
of
nothing
for
if
it
were
begotten
of
something
then
the
begotten
would
not
come
from
a
beginning
but
if
unbegotten
it
must
also
be
indestructible
for
if
beginning
were
destroyed
there
could
be
no
beginning
out
of
anything
nor
anything
out
of
a
beginning
and
all
things
must
have
a
beginning
and
therefore
the
is
the
beginning
of
motion
and
this
can
neither
be
destroyed
nor
begotten
else
the
whole
heavens
and
all
creation
would
collapse
and
stand
still
and
never
again
have
motion
or
birth
but
if
the
is
proved
to
be
immortal
he
who
affirms
that
is
the
very
idea
and
essence
of
the
soul
will
not
be
put
to
confusion
for
the
body
which
is
moved
from
without
is
soulless
but
that
which
is
moved
from
within
has
a
soul
for
such
is
the
nature
of
the
soul
but
if
this
be
true
must
not
the
soul
be
the
and
therefore
of
necessity
unbegotten
and
immortal
enough
of
the
immortality
of
the
nature
of
the
soul
though
her
true
form
be
ever
a
theme
of
large
and
more
than
mortal
discourse
let
me
speak
briefly
and
in
a
figure
and
let
the
figure
be
composite
a
pair
of
winged
horses
and
a
charioteer
now
the
winged
horses
and
the
charioteers
of
the
gods
are
all
of
them
noble
and
of
noble
descent
but
those
of
other
races
are
mixed
the
human
charioteer
drives
his
in
a
pair
and
one
of
them
is
noble
and
of
noble
breed
and
the
other
is
ignoble
and
of
ignoble
breed
and
the
driving
of
them
of
necessity
gives
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
him
i
will
endeavour
to
explain
to
you
in
what
way
the
mortal
differs
from
the
immortal
creature
the
soul
in
her
totality
has
the
care
of
inanimate
being
everywhere
and
traverses
the
whole
heaven
in
divers
forms
appearing
when
perfect
and
fully
winged
she
soars
upward
and
orders
the
whole
world
whereas
the
imperfect
soul
losing
her
wings
and
drooping
in
her
flight
at
last
settles
on
the
solid
ground
there
finding
a
home
she
receives
an
earthly
frame
which
appears
to
be
but
is
really
moved
by
her
power
and
this
composition
of
soul
and
body
is
called
a
living
and
mortal
creature
for
immortal
no
such
union
can
be
reasonably
believed
to
be
although
fancy
not
having
seen
nor
surely
known
the
nature
of
god
may
imagine
an
immortal
creature
having
both
a
body
and
also
a
soul
which
are
united
throughout
all
time
let
that
however
be
as
god
wills
and
be
spoken
of
acceptably
to
him
and
now
let
us
ask
the
reason
why
the
soul
loses
her
wings
the
wing
is
the
corporeal
element
which
is
most
akin
to
the
divine
and
which
by
nature
tends
to
soar
aloft
and
carry
that
which
gravitates
downwards
into
the
upper
region
which
is
the
habitation
of
the
gods
the
divine
is
beauty
wisdom
goodness
and
the
like
and
by
these
the
wing
of
the
soul
is
nourished
and
grows
apace
but
when
fed
upon
evil
and
foulness
and
the
opposite
of
good
wastes
and
falls
away
zeus
the
mighty
lord
holding
the
reins
of
a
winged
chariot
leads
the
way
in
heaven
ordering
all
and
taking
care
of
all
and
there
follows
him
the
array
of
gods
and
marshalled
in
eleven
bands
hestia
alone
abides
at
home
in
the
house
of
heaven
of
the
rest
they
who
are
reckoned
among
the
princely
twelve
march
in
their
appointed
order
they
see
many
blessed
sights
in
the
inner
heaven
and
there
are
many
ways
to
and
fro
along
which
the
blessed
gods
are
passing
every
one
doing
his
own
work
he
may
follow
who
will
and
can
for
jealousy
has
no
place
in
the
celestial
choir
but
when
they
go
to
banquet
and
festival
then
they
move
up
the
steep
to
the
top
of
the
vault
of
heaven
the
chariots
of
the
gods
in
even
poise
obeying
the
rein
glide
rapidly
but
the
others
labour
for
the
vicious
steed
goes
heavily
weighing
down
the
charioteer
to
the
earth
when
his
steed
has
not
been
thoroughly
trained
and
this
is
the
hour
of
agony
and
extremest
conflict
for
the
soul
for
the
immortals
when
they
are
at
the
end
of
their
course
go
forth
and
stand
upon
the
outside
of
heaven
and
the
revolution
of
the
spheres
carries
them
round
and
they
behold
the
things
beyond
but
of
the
heaven
which
is
above
the
heavens
what
earthly
poet
ever
did
or
ever
will
sing
worthily
it
is
such
as
i
will
describe
for
i
must
dare
to
speak
the
truth
when
truth
is
my
theme
there
abides
the
very
being
with
which
true
knowledge
is
concerned
the
colourless
formless
intangible
essence
visible
only
to
mind
the
pilot
of
the
soul
the
divine
intelligence
being
nurtured
upon
mind
and
pure
knowledge
and
the
intelligence
of
every
soul
which
is
capable
of
receiving
the
food
proper
to
it
rejoices
at
beholding
reality
and
once
more
gazing
upon
truth
is
replenished
and
made
glad
until
the
revolution
of
the
worlds
brings
her
round
again
to
the
same
place
in
the
revolution
she
beholds
justice
and
temperance
and
knowledge
absolute
not
in
the
form
of
generation
or
of
relation
which
men
call
existence
but
knowledge
absolute
in
existence
absolute
and
beholding
the
other
true
existences
in
like
manner
and
feasting
upon
them
she
passes
down
into
the
interior
of
the
heavens
and
returns
home
and
there
the
charioteer
putting
up
his
horses
at
the
stall
gives
them
ambrosia
to
eat
and
nectar
to
drink
such
is
the
life
of
the
gods
but
of
other
souls
that
which
follows
god
best
and
is
likest
to
him
lifts
the
head
of
the
charioteer
into
the
outer
world
and
is
carried
round
in
the
revolution
troubled
indeed
by
the
steeds
and
with
difficulty
beholding
true
being
while
another
only
rises
and
falls
and
sees
and
again
fails
to
see
by
reason
of
the
unruliness
of
the
steeds
the
rest
of
the
souls
are
also
longing
after
the
upper
world
and
they
all
follow
but
not
being
strong
enough
they
are
carried
round
below
the
surface
plunging
treading
on
one
another
each
striving
to
be
first
and
there
is
confusion
and
perspiration
and
the
extremity
of
effort
and
many
of
them
are
lamed
or
have
their
wings
broken
through
the
of
the
charioteers
and
all
of
them
after
a
fruitless
toil
not
having
attained
to
the
mysteries
of
true
being
go
away
and
feed
upon
opinion
the
reason
why
the
souls
exhibit
this
exceeding
eagerness
to
behold
the
plain
of
truth
is
that
pasturage
is
found
there
which
is
suited
to
the
highest
part
of
the
soul
and
the
wing
on
which
the
soul
soars
is
nourished
with
this
and
there
is
a
law
of
destiny
that
the
soul
which
attains
any
vision
of
truth
in
company
with
a
god
is
preserved
from
harm
until
the
next
period
and
if
attaining
always
is
always
unharmed
but
when
she
is
unable
to
follow
and
fails
to
behold
the
truth
and
through
some
sinks
beneath
the
double
load
of
forgetfulness
and
vice
and
her
wings
fall
from
her
and
she
drops
to
the
ground
then
the
law
ordains
that
this
soul
shall
at
her
first
birth
pass
not
into
any
other
animal
but
only
into
man
and
the
soul
which
has
seen
most
of
truth
shall
come
to
the
birth
as
a
philosopher
or
artist
or
some
musical
and
loving
nature
that
which
has
seen
truth
in
the
second
degree
shall
be
some
righteous
king
or
warrior
chief
the
soul
which
is
of
the
third
class
shall
be
a
politician
or
economist
or
trader
the
fourth
shall
be
a
lover
of
gymnastic
toils
or
a
physician
the
fifth
shall
lead
the
life
of
a
prophet
or
hierophant
to
the
sixth
the
character
of
poet
or
some
other
imitative
artist
will
be
assigned
to
the
seventh
the
life
of
an
artisan
or
husbandman
to
the
eighth
that
of
a
sophist
or
demagogue
to
the
ninth
that
of
a
tyrant
all
these
are
states
of
probation
in
which
he
who
does
righteously
improves
and
he
who
does
unrighteously
deteriorates
his
lot
ten
thousand
years
must
elapse
before
the
soul
of
each
one
can
return
to
the
place
from
whence
she
came
for
she
can
not
grow
her
wings
in
less
only
the
soul
of
a
philosopher
guileless
and
true
or
the
soul
of
a
lover
who
is
not
devoid
of
philosophy
may
acquire
wings
in
the
third
of
the
recurring
periods
of
a
thousand
years
he
is
distinguished
from
the
ordinary
good
man
who
gains
wings
in
three
thousand
years
and
they
who
choose
this
life
three
times
in
succession
have
wings
given
them
and
go
away
at
the
end
of
three
thousand
years
but
the
others
the
philosopher
alone
is
not
subject
to
judgment
krisis
for
he
has
never
lost
the
vision
of
truth
receive
judgment
when
they
have
completed
their
first
life
and
after
the
judgment
they
go
some
of
them
to
the
houses
of
correction
which
are
under
the
earth
and
are
punished
others
to
some
place
in
heaven
whither
they
are
lightly
borne
by
justice
and
there
they
live
in
a
manner
worthy
of
the
life
which
they
led
here
when
in
the
form
of
men
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
thousand
years
the
good
souls
and
also
the
evil
souls
both
come
to
draw
lots
and
choose
their
second
life
and
they
may
take
any
which
they
please
the
soul
of
a
man
may
pass
into
the
life
of
a
beast
or
from
the
beast
return
again
into
the
man
but
the
soul
which
has
never
seen
the
truth
will
not
pass
into
the
human
form
for
a
man
must
have
intelligence
of
universals
and
be
able
to
proceed
from
the
many
particulars
of
sense
to
one
conception
of
reason
this
is
the
recollection
of
those
things
which
our
soul
once
saw
while
following
god
when
regardless
of
that
which
we
now
call
being
she
raised
her
head
up
towards
the
true
being
and
therefore
the
mind
of
the
philosopher
alone
has
wings
and
this
is
just
for
he
is
always
according
to
the
measure
of
his
abilities
clinging
in
recollection
to
those
things
in
which
god
abides
and
in
beholding
which
he
is
what
he
is
and
he
who
employs
aright
these
memories
is
ever
being
initiated
into
perfect
mysteries
and
alone
becomes
truly
perfect
but
as
he
forgets
earthly
interests
and
is
rapt
in
the
divine
the
vulgar
deem
him
mad
and
rebuke
him
they
do
not
see
that
he
is
inspired
thus
far
i
have
been
speaking
of
the
fourth
and
last
kind
of
madness
which
is
imputed
to
him
who
when
he
sees
the
beauty
of
earth
is
transported
with
the
recollection
of
the
true
beauty
he
would
like
to
fly
away
but
he
can
not
he
is
like
a
bird
fluttering
and
looking
upward
and
careless
of
the
world
below
and
he
is
therefore
thought
to
be
mad
and
i
have
shown
this
of
all
inspirations
to
be
the
noblest
and
highest
and
the
offspring
of
the
highest
to
him
who
has
or
shares
in
it
and
that
he
who
loves
the
beautiful
is
called
a
lover
because
he
partakes
of
it
for
as
has
been
already
said
every
soul
of
man
has
in
the
way
of
nature
beheld
true
being
this
was
the
condition
of
her
passing
into
the
form
of
man
but
all
souls
do
not
easily
recall
the
things
of
the
other
world
they
may
have
seen
them
for
a
short
time
only
or
they
may
have
been
unfortunate
in
their
earthly
lot
and
having
had
their
hearts
turned
to
unrighteousness
through
some
corrupting
influence
they
may
have
lost
the
memory
of
the
holy
things
which
once
they
saw
few
only
retain
an
adequate
remembrance
of
them
and
they
when
they
behold
here
any
image
of
that
other
world
are
rapt
in
amazement
but
they
are
ignorant
of
what
this
rapture
means
because
they
do
not
clearly
perceive
for
there
is
no
light
of
justice
or
temperance
or
any
of
the
higher
ideas
which
are
precious
to
souls
in
the
earthly
copies
of
them
they
are
seen
through
a
glass
dimly
and
there
are
few
who
going
to
the
images
behold
in
them
the
realities
and
these
only
with
difficulty
there
was
a
time
when
with
the
rest
of
the
happy
band
they
saw
beauty
shining
in
brightness
we
philosophers
following
in
the
train
of
zeus
others
in
company
with
other
gods
and
then
we
beheld
the
beatific
vision
and
were
initiated
into
a
mystery
which
may
be
truly
called
most
blessed
celebrated
by
us
in
our
state
of
innocence
before
we
had
any
experience
of
evils
to
come
when
we
were
admitted
to
the
sight
of
apparitions
innocent
and
simple
and
calm
and
happy
which
we
beheld
shining
in
pure
light
pure
ourselves
and
not
yet
enshrined
in
that
living
tomb
which
we
carry
about
now
that
we
are
imprisoned
in
the
body
like
an
oyster
in
his
shell
let
me
linger
over
the
memory
of
scenes
which
have
passed
away
but
of
beauty
i
repeat
again
that
we
saw
her
there
shining
in
company
with
the
celestial
forms
and
coming
to
earth
we
find
her
here
too
shining
in
clearness
through
the
clearest
aperture
of
sense
for
sight
is
the
most
piercing
of
our
bodily
senses
though
not
by
that
is
wisdom
seen
her
loveliness
would
have
been
transporting
if
there
had
been
a
visible
image
of
her
and
the
other
ideas
if
they
had
visible
counterparts
would
be
equally
lovely
but
this
is
the
privilege
of
beauty
that
being
the
loveliest
she
is
also
the
most
palpable
to
sight
now
he
who
is
not
newly
initiated
or
who
has
become
corrupted
does
not
easily
rise
out
of
this
world
to
the
sight
of
true
beauty
in
the
other
he
looks
only
at
her
earthly
namesake
and
instead
of
being
awed
at
the
sight
of
her
he
is
given
over
to
pleasure
and
like
a
brutish
beast
he
rushes
on
to
enjoy
and
beget
he
consorts
with
wantonness
and
is
not
afraid
or
ashamed
of
pursuing
pleasure
in
violation
of
nature
but
he
whose
initiation
is
recent
and
who
has
been
the
spectator
of
many
glories
in
the
other
world
is
amazed
when
he
sees
any
one
having
a
godlike
face
or
form
which
is
the
expression
of
divine
beauty
and
at
first
a
shudder
runs
through
him
and
again
the
old
awe
steals
over
him
then
looking
upon
the
face
of
his
beloved
as
of
a
god
he
reverences
him
and
if
he
were
not
afraid
of
being
thought
a
downright
madman
he
would
sacrifice
to
his
beloved
as
to
the
image
of
a
god
then
while
he
gazes
on
him
there
is
a
sort
of
reaction
and
the
shudder
passes
into
an
unusual
heat
and
perspiration
for
as
he
receives
the
effluence
of
beauty
through
the
eyes
the
wing
moistens
and
he
warms
and
as
he
warms
the
parts
out
of
which
the
wing
grew
and
which
had
been
hitherto
closed
and
rigid
and
had
prevented
the
wing
from
shooting
forth
are
melted
and
as
nourishment
streams
upon
him
the
lower
end
of
the
wing
begins
to
swell
and
grow
from
the
root
upwards
and
the
growth
extends
under
the
whole
soul
for
once
the
whole
was
winged
during
this
process
the
whole
soul
is
all
in
a
state
of
ebullition
and
effervescence
which
may
be
compared
to
the
irritation
and
uneasiness
in
the
gums
at
the
time
of
cutting
teeth
bubbles
up
and
has
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
and
tickling
but
when
in
like
manner
the
soul
is
beginning
to
grow
wings
the
beauty
of
the
beloved
meets
her
eye
and
she
receives
the
sensible
warm
motion
of
particles
which
flow
towards
her
therefore
called
emotion
imeros
and
is
refreshed
and
warmed
by
them
and
then
she
ceases
from
her
pain
with
joy
but
when
she
is
parted
from
her
beloved
and
her
moisture
fails
then
the
orifices
of
the
passage
out
of
which
the
wing
shoots
dry
up
and
close
and
intercept
the
germ
of
the
wing
which
being
shut
up
with
the
emotion
throbbing
as
with
the
pulsations
of
an
artery
pricks
the
aperture
which
is
nearest
until
at
length
the
entire
soul
is
pierced
and
maddened
and
pained
and
at
the
recollection
of
beauty
is
again
delighted
and
from
both
of
them
together
the
soul
is
oppressed
at
the
strangeness
of
her
condition
and
is
in
a
great
strait
and
excitement
and
in
her
madness
can
neither
sleep
by
night
nor
abide
in
her
place
by
day
and
wherever
she
thinks
that
she
will
behold
the
beautiful
one
thither
in
her
desire
she
runs
and
when
she
has
seen
him
and
bathed
herself
in
the
waters
of
beauty
her
constraint
is
loosened
and
she
is
refreshed
and
has
no
more
pangs
and
pains
and
this
is
the
sweetest
of
all
pleasures
at
the
time
and
is
the
reason
why
the
soul
of
the
lover
will
never
forsake
his
beautiful
one
whom
he
esteems
above
all
he
has
forgotten
mother
and
brethren
and
companions
and
he
thinks
nothing
of
the
neglect
and
loss
of
his
property
the
rules
and
proprieties
of
life
on
which
he
formerly
prided
himself
he
now
despises
and
is
ready
to
sleep
like
a
servant
wherever
he
is
allowed
as
near
as
he
can
to
his
desired
one
who
is
the
object
of
his
worship
and
the
physician
who
can
alone
assuage
the
greatness
of
his
pain
and
this
state
my
dear
imaginary
youth
to
whom
i
am
talking
is
by
men
called
love
and
among
the
gods
has
a
name
at
which
you
in
your
simplicity
may
be
inclined
to
mock
there
are
two
lines
in
the
apocryphal
writings
of
homer
in
which
the
name
occurs
one
of
them
is
rather
outrageous
and
not
altogether
metrical
they
are
as
follows
call
him
fluttering
love
but
the
immortals
call
him
winged
one
because
the
growing
of
wings
or
reading
pterothoiton
movement
of
wings
is
a
necessity
to
him
you
may
believe
this
but
not
unless
you
like
at
any
rate
the
loves
of
lovers
and
their
causes
are
such
as
i
have
described
now
the
lover
who
is
taken
to
be
the
attendant
of
zeus
is
better
able
to
bear
the
winged
god
and
can
endure
a
heavier
burden
but
the
attendants
and
companions
of
ares
when
under
the
influence
of
love
if
they
fancy
that
they
have
been
at
all
wronged
are
ready
to
kill
and
put
an
end
to
themselves
and
their
beloved
and
he
who
follows
in
the
train
of
any
other
god
while
he
is
unspoiled
and
the
impression
lasts
honours
and
imitates
him
as
far
as
he
is
able
and
after
the
manner
of
his
god
he
behaves
in
his
intercourse
with
his
beloved
and
with
the
rest
of
the
world
during
the
first
period
of
his
earthly
existence
every
one
chooses
his
love
from
the
ranks
of
beauty
according
to
his
character
and
this
he
makes
his
god
and
fashions
and
adorns
as
a
sort
of
image
which
he
is
to
fall
down
and
worship
the
followers
of
zeus
desire
that
their
beloved
should
have
a
soul
like
him
and
therefore
they
seek
out
some
one
of
a
philosophical
and
imperial
nature
and
when
they
have
found
him
and
loved
him
they
do
all
they
can
to
confirm
such
a
nature
in
him
and
if
they
have
no
experience
of
such
a
disposition
hitherto
they
learn
of
any
one
who
can
teach
them
and
themselves
follow
in
the
same
way
and
they
have
the
less
difficulty
in
finding
the
nature
of
their
own
god
in
themselves
because
they
have
been
compelled
to
gaze
intensely
on
him
their
recollection
clings
to
him
and
they
become
possessed
of
him
and
receive
from
him
their
character
and
disposition
so
far
as
man
can
participate
in
god
the
qualities
of
their
god
they
attribute
to
the
beloved
wherefore
they
love
him
all
the
more
and
if
like
the
bacchic
nymphs
they
draw
inspiration
from
zeus
they
pour
out
their
own
fountain
upon
him
wanting
to
make
him
as
like
as
possible
to
their
own
god
but
those
who
are
the
followers
of
here
seek
a
royal
love
and
when
they
have
found
him
they
do
just
the
same
with
him
and
in
like
manner
the
followers
of
apollo
and
of
every
other
god
walking
in
the
ways
of
their
god
seek
a
love
who
is
to
be
made
like
him
whom
they
serve
and
when
they
have
found
him
they
themselves
imitate
their
god
and
persuade
their
love
to
do
the
same
and
educate
him
into
the
manner
and
nature
of
the
god
as
far
as
they
each
can
for
no
feelings
of
envy
or
jealousy
are
entertained
by
them
towards
their
beloved
but
they
do
their
utmost
to
create
in
him
the
greatest
likeness
of
themselves
and
of
the
god
whom
they
honour
thus
fair
and
blissful
to
the
beloved
is
the
desire
of
the
inspired
lover
and
the
initiation
of
which
i
speak
into
the
mysteries
of
true
love
if
he
be
captured
by
the
lover
and
their
purpose
is
effected
now
the
beloved
is
taken
captive
in
the
following
manner
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
this
tale
i
divided
each
soul
into
three
two
horses
and
a
charioteer
and
one
of
the
horses
was
good
and
the
other
bad
the
division
may
remain
but
i
have
not
yet
explained
in
what
the
goodness
or
badness
of
either
consists
and
to
that
i
will
now
proceed
the
horse
is
upright
and
cleanly
made
he
has
a
lofty
neck
and
an
aquiline
nose
his
colour
is
white
and
his
eyes
dark
he
is
a
lover
of
honour
and
modesty
and
temperance
and
the
follower
of
true
glory
he
needs
no
touch
of
the
whip
but
is
guided
by
word
and
admonition
only
the
other
is
a
crooked
lumbering
animal
put
together
anyhow
he
has
a
short
thick
neck
he
is
and
of
a
dark
colour
with
grey
eyes
and
complexion
or
with
grey
and
eyes
the
mate
of
insolence
and
pride
and
deaf
hardly
yielding
to
whip
and
spur
now
when
the
charioteer
beholds
the
vision
of
love
and
has
his
whole
soul
warmed
through
sense
and
is
full
of
the
prickings
and
ticklings
of
desire
the
obedient
steed
then
as
always
under
the
government
of
shame
refrains
from
leaping
on
the
beloved
but
the
other
heedless
of
the
pricks
and
of
the
blows
of
the
whip
plunges
and
runs
away
giving
all
manner
of
trouble
to
his
companion
and
the
charioteer
whom
he
forces
to
approach
the
beloved
and
to
remember
the
joys
of
love
they
at
first
indignantly
oppose
him
and
will
not
be
urged
on
to
do
terrible
and
unlawful
deeds
but
at
last
when
he
persists
in
plaguing
them
they
yield
and
agree
to
do
as
he
bids
them
and
now
they
are
at
the
spot
and
behold
the
flashing
beauty
of
the
beloved
which
when
the
charioteer
sees
his
memory
is
carried
to
the
true
beauty
whom
he
beholds
in
company
with
modesty
like
an
image
placed
upon
a
holy
pedestal
he
sees
her
but
he
is
afraid
and
falls
backwards
in
adoration
and
by
his
fall
is
compelled
to
pull
back
the
reins
with
such
violence
as
to
bring
both
the
steeds
on
their
haunches
the
one
willing
and
unresisting
the
unruly
one
very
unwilling
and
when
they
have
gone
back
a
little
the
one
is
overcome
with
shame
and
wonder
and
his
whole
soul
is
bathed
in
perspiration
the
other
when
the
pain
is
over
which
the
bridle
and
the
fall
had
given
him
having
with
difficulty
taken
breath
is
full
of
wrath
and
reproaches
which
he
heaps
upon
the
charioteer
and
his
for
want
of
courage
and
manhood
declaring
that
they
have
been
false
to
their
agreement
and
guilty
of
desertion
again
they
refuse
and
again
he
urges
them
on
and
will
scarce
yield
to
their
prayer
that
he
would
wait
until
another
time
when
the
appointed
hour
comes
they
make
as
if
they
had
forgotten
and
he
reminds
them
fighting
and
neighing
and
dragging
them
on
until
at
length
he
on
the
same
thoughts
intent
forces
them
to
draw
near
again
and
when
they
are
near
he
stoops
his
head
and
puts
up
his
tail
and
takes
the
bit
in
his
teeth
and
pulls
shamelessly
then
the
charioteer
is
worse
off
than
ever
he
falls
back
like
a
racer
at
the
barrier
and
with
a
still
more
violent
wrench
drags
the
bit
out
of
the
teeth
of
the
wild
steed
and
covers
his
abusive
tongue
and
jaws
with
blood
and
forces
his
legs
and
haunches
to
the
ground
and
punishes
him
sorely
and
when
this
has
happened
several
times
and
the
villain
has
ceased
from
his
wanton
way
he
is
tamed
and
humbled
and
follows
the
will
of
the
charioteer
and
when
he
sees
the
beautiful
one
he
is
ready
to
die
of
fear
and
from
that
time
forward
the
soul
of
the
lover
follows
the
beloved
in
modesty
and
holy
fear
and
so
the
beloved
who
like
a
god
has
received
every
true
and
loyal
service
from
his
lover
not
in
pretence
but
in
reality
being
also
himself
of
a
nature
friendly
to
his
admirer
if
in
former
days
he
has
blushed
to
own
his
passion
and
turned
away
his
lover
because
his
youthful
companions
or
others
slanderously
told
him
that
he
would
be
disgraced
now
as
years
advance
at
the
appointed
age
and
time
is
led
to
receive
him
into
communion
for
fate
which
has
ordained
that
there
shall
be
no
friendship
among
the
evil
has
also
ordained
that
there
shall
ever
be
friendship
among
the
good
and
the
beloved
when
he
has
received
him
into
communion
and
intimacy
is
quite
amazed
at
the
of
the
lover
he
recognises
that
the
inspired
friend
is
worth
all
other
friends
or
kinsmen
they
have
nothing
of
friendship
in
them
worthy
to
be
compared
with
his
and
when
this
feeling
continues
and
he
is
nearer
to
him
and
embraces
him
in
gymnastic
exercises
and
at
other
times
of
meeting
then
the
fountain
of
that
stream
which
zeus
when
he
was
in
love
with
ganymede
named
desire
overflows
upon
the
lover
and
some
enters
into
his
soul
and
some
when
he
is
filled
flows
out
again
and
as
a
breeze
or
an
echo
rebounds
from
the
smooth
rocks
and
returns
whence
it
came
so
does
the
stream
of
beauty
passing
through
the
eyes
which
are
the
windows
of
the
soul
come
back
to
the
beautiful
one
there
arriving
and
quickening
the
passages
of
the
wings
watering
them
and
inclining
them
to
grow
and
filling
the
soul
of
the
beloved
also
with
love
and
thus
he
loves
but
he
knows
not
what
he
does
not
understand
and
can
not
explain
his
own
state
he
appears
to
have
caught
the
infection
of
blindness
from
another
the
lover
is
his
mirror
in
whom
he
is
beholding
himself
but
he
is
not
aware
of
this
when
he
is
with
the
lover
both
cease
from
their
pain
but
when
he
is
away
then
he
longs
as
he
is
longed
for
and
has
love
image
love
for
love
anteros
lodging
in
his
breast
which
he
calls
and
believes
to
be
not
love
but
friendship
only
and
his
desire
is
as
the
desire
of
the
other
but
weaker
he
wants
to
see
him
touch
him
kiss
him
embrace
him
and
probably
not
long
afterwards
his
desire
is
accomplished
when
they
meet
the
wanton
steed
of
the
lover
has
a
word
to
say
to
the
charioteer
he
would
like
to
have
a
little
pleasure
in
return
for
many
pains
but
the
wanton
steed
of
the
beloved
says
not
a
word
for
he
is
bursting
with
passion
which
he
understands
not
he
throws
his
arms
round
the
lover
and
embraces
him
as
his
dearest
friend
and
when
they
are
side
by
side
he
is
not
in
a
state
in
which
he
can
refuse
the
lover
anything
if
he
ask
him
although
his
and
the
charioteer
oppose
him
with
the
arguments
of
shame
and
reason
after
this
their
happiness
depends
upon
their
if
the
better
elements
of
the
mind
which
lead
to
order
and
philosophy
prevail
then
they
pass
their
life
here
in
happiness
and
harmony
masters
of
themselves
and
orderly
enslaving
the
vicious
and
emancipating
the
virtuous
elements
of
the
soul
and
when
the
end
comes
they
are
light
and
winged
for
flight
having
conquered
in
one
of
the
three
heavenly
or
truly
olympian
victories
nor
can
human
discipline
or
divine
inspiration
confer
any
greater
blessing
on
man
than
this
if
on
the
other
hand
they
leave
philosophy
and
lead
the
lower
life
of
ambition
then
probably
after
wine
or
in
some
other
careless
hour
the
two
wanton
animals
take
the
two
souls
when
off
their
guard
and
bring
them
together
and
they
accomplish
that
desire
of
their
hearts
which
to
the
many
is
bliss
and
this
having
once
enjoyed
they
continue
to
enjoy
yet
rarely
because
they
have
not
the
approval
of
the
whole
soul
they
too
are
dear
but
not
so
dear
to
one
another
as
the
others
either
at
the
time
of
their
love
or
afterwards
they
consider
that
they
have
given
and
taken
from
each
other
the
most
sacred
pledges
and
they
may
not
break
them
and
fall
into
enmity
at
last
they
pass
out
of
the
body
unwinged
but
eager
to
soar
and
thus
obtain
no
mean
reward
of
love
and
madness
for
those
who
have
once
begun
the
heavenward
pilgrimage
may
not
go
down
again
to
darkness
and
the
journey
beneath
the
earth
but
they
live
in
light
always
happy
companions
in
their
pilgrimage
and
when
the
time
comes
at
which
they
receive
their
wings
they
have
the
same
plumage
because
of
their
love
thus
great
are
the
heavenly
blessings
which
the
friendship
of
a
lover
will
confer
upon
you
my
youth
whereas
the
attachment
of
the
which
is
alloyed
with
a
worldly
prudence
and
has
worldly
and
niggardly
ways
of
doling
out
benefits
will
breed
in
your
soul
those
vulgar
qualities
which
the
populace
applaud
will
send
you
bowling
round
the
earth
during
a
period
of
nine
thousand
years
and
leave
you
a
fool
in
the
world
below
and
thus
dear
eros
i
have
made
and
paid
my
recantation
as
well
and
as
fairly
as
i
could
more
especially
in
the
matter
of
the
poetical
figures
which
i
was
compelled
to
use
because
phaedrus
would
have
them
and
now
forgive
the
past
and
accept
the
present
and
be
gracious
and
merciful
to
me
and
do
not
in
thine
anger
deprive
me
of
sight
or
take
from
me
the
art
of
love
which
thou
hast
given
me
but
grant
that
i
may
be
yet
more
esteemed
in
the
eyes
of
the
fair
and
if
phaedrus
or
i
myself
said
anything
rude
in
our
first
speeches
blame
lysias
who
is
the
father
of
the
brat
and
let
us
have
no
more
of
his
progeny
bid
him
study
philosophy
like
his
brother
polemarchus
and
then
his
lover
phaedrus
will
no
longer
halt
between
two
opinions
but
will
dedicate
himself
wholly
to
love
and
to
philosophical
discourses
phaedrus
i
join
in
the
prayer
socrates
and
say
with
you
if
this
be
for
my
good
may
your
words
come
to
pass
but
why
did
you
make
your
second
oration
so
much
finer
than
the
first
i
wonder
why
and
i
begin
to
be
afraid
that
i
shall
lose
conceit
of
lysias
and
that
he
will
appear
tame
in
comparison
even
if
he
be
willing
to
put
another
as
fine
and
as
long
as
yours
into
the
field
which
i
doubt
for
quite
lately
one
of
your
politicians
was
abusing
him
on
this
very
account
and
called
him
a
writer
again
and
again
so
that
a
feeling
of
pride
may
probably
induce
him
to
give
up
writing
speeches
socrates
what
a
very
amusing
notion
but
i
think
my
young
man
that
you
are
much
mistaken
in
your
friend
if
you
imagine
that
he
is
frightened
at
a
little
noise
and
possibly
you
think
that
his
assailant
was
in
earnest
phaedrus
i
thought
socrates
that
he
was
and
you
are
aware
that
the
greatest
and
most
influential
statesmen
are
ashamed
of
writing
speeches
and
leaving
them
in
a
written
form
lest
they
should
be
called
sophists
by
posterity
socrates
you
seem
to
be
unconscious
phaedrus
that
the
a
proverb
like
grapes
are
sour
applied
to
pleasures
which
can
not
be
had
meaning
sweet
things
which
like
the
elbow
are
out
of
the
reach
of
the
mouth
the
promised
pleasure
turns
out
to
be
a
long
and
tedious
affair
of
the
proverb
is
really
the
long
arm
of
the
nile
and
you
appear
to
be
equally
unaware
of
the
fact
that
this
sweet
elbow
of
theirs
is
also
a
long
arm
for
there
is
nothing
of
which
our
great
politicians
are
so
fond
as
of
writing
speeches
and
bequeathing
them
to
posterity
and
they
add
their
admirers
names
at
the
top
of
the
writing
out
of
gratitude
to
them
phaedrus
what
do
you
mean
i
do
not
understand
socrates
why
do
you
not
know
that
when
a
politician
writes
he
begins
with
the
names
of
his
approvers
phaedrus
how
so
socrates
why
he
begins
in
this
manner
it
enacted
by
the
senate
the
people
or
both
on
the
motion
of
a
certain
person
who
is
our
author
and
so
putting
on
a
serious
face
he
proceeds
to
display
his
own
wisdom
to
his
admirers
in
what
is
often
a
long
and
tedious
composition
now
what
is
that
sort
of
thing
but
a
regular
piece
of
authorship
phaedrus
true
socrates
and
if
the
law
is
finally
approved
then
the
author
leaves
the
theatre
in
high
delight
but
if
the
law
is
rejected
and
he
is
done
out
of
his
and
not
thought
good
enough
to
write
then
he
and
his
party
are
in
mourning
phaedrus
very
true
socrates
so
far
are
they
from
despising
or
rather
so
highly
do
they
value
the
practice
of
writing
phaedrus
no
doubt
socrates
and
when
the
king
or
orator
has
the
power
as
lycurgus
or
solon
or
darius
had
of
attaining
an
immortality
or
authorship
in
a
state
is
he
not
thought
by
posterity
when
they
see
his
compositions
and
does
he
not
think
himself
while
he
is
yet
alive
to
be
a
god
phaedrus
very
true
socrates
then
do
you
think
that
any
one
of
this
class
however
would
reproach
lysias
with
being
an
author
phaedrus
not
upon
your
view
for
according
to
you
he
would
be
casting
a
slur
upon
his
own
favourite
pursuit
socrates
any
one
may
see
that
there
is
no
disgrace
in
the
mere
fact
of
writing
phaedrus
certainly
not
socrates
the
disgrace
begins
when
a
man
writes
not
well
but
badly
phaedrus
clearly
socrates
and
what
is
well
and
what
is
badly
need
we
ask
lysias
or
any
other
poet
or
orator
who
ever
wrote
or
will
write
either
a
political
or
any
other
work
in
metre
or
out
of
metre
poet
or
prose
writer
to
teach
us
this
phaedrus
need
we
for
what
should
a
man
live
if
not
for
the
pleasures
of
discourse
surely
not
for
the
sake
of
bodily
pleasures
which
almost
always
have
previous
pain
as
a
condition
of
them
and
therefore
are
rightly
called
slavish
socrates
there
is
time
enough
and
i
believe
that
the
grasshoppers
chirruping
after
their
manner
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
over
our
heads
are
talking
to
one
another
and
looking
down
at
us
what
would
they
say
if
they
saw
that
we
like
the
many
are
not
conversing
but
slumbering
at
lulled
by
their
voices
too
indolent
to
think
would
they
not
have
a
right
to
laugh
at
us
they
might
imagine
that
we
were
slaves
who
coming
to
rest
at
a
place
of
resort
of
theirs
like
sheep
lie
asleep
at
noon
around
the
well
but
if
they
see
us
discoursing
and
like
odysseus
sailing
past
them
deaf
to
their
siren
voices
they
may
perhaps
out
of
respect
give
us
of
the
gifts
which
they
receive
from
the
gods
that
they
may
impart
them
to
men
phaedrus
what
gifts
do
you
mean
i
never
heard
of
any
socrates
a
lover
of
music
like
yourself
ought
surely
to
have
heard
the
story
of
the
grasshoppers
who
are
said
to
have
been
human
beings
in
an
age
before
the
muses
and
when
the
muses
came
and
song
appeared
they
were
ravished
with
delight
and
singing
always
never
thought
of
eating
and
drinking
until
at
last
in
their
forgetfulness
they
died
and
now
they
live
again
in
the
grasshoppers
and
this
is
the
return
which
the
muses
make
to
them
they
neither
hunger
nor
thirst
but
from
the
hour
of
their
birth
are
always
singing
and
never
eating
or
drinking
and
when
they
die
they
go
and
inform
the
muses
in
heaven
who
honours
them
on
earth
they
win
the
love
of
terpsichore
for
the
dancers
by
their
report
of
them
of
erato
for
the
lovers
and
of
the
other
muses
for
those
who
do
them
honour
according
to
the
several
ways
of
honouring
them
of
calliope
the
eldest
muse
and
of
urania
who
is
next
to
her
for
the
philosophers
of
whose
music
the
grasshoppers
make
report
to
them
for
these
are
the
muses
who
are
chiefly
concerned
with
heaven
and
thought
divine
as
well
as
human
and
they
have
the
sweetest
utterance
for
many
reasons
then
we
ought
always
to
talk
and
not
to
sleep
at
phaedrus
let
us
talk
socrates
shall
we
discuss
the
rules
of
writing
and
speech
as
we
were
proposing
phaedrus
very
good
socrates
in
good
speaking
should
not
the
mind
of
the
speaker
know
the
truth
of
the
matter
about
which
he
is
going
to
speak
phaedrus
and
yet
socrates
i
have
heard
that
he
who
would
be
an
orator
has
nothing
to
do
with
true
justice
but
only
with
that
which
is
likely
to
be
approved
by
the
many
who
sit
in
judgment
nor
with
the
truly
good
or
honourable
but
only
with
opinion
about
them
and
that
from
opinion
comes
persuasion
and
not
from
the
truth
socrates
the
words
of
the
wise
are
not
to
be
set
aside
for
there
is
probably
something
in
them
and
therefore
the
meaning
of
this
saying
is
not
hastily
to
be
dismissed
phaedrus
very
true
socrates
let
us
put
the
matter
thus
suppose
that
i
persuaded
you
to
buy
a
horse
and
go
to
the
wars
neither
of
us
knew
what
a
horse
was
like
but
i
knew
that
you
believed
a
horse
to
be
of
tame
animals
the
one
which
has
the
longest
ears
phaedrus
that
would
be
ridiculous
socrates
there
is
something
more
ridiculous
coming
suppose
further
that
in
sober
earnest
i
having
persuaded
you
of
this
went
and
composed
a
speech
in
honour
of
an
ass
whom
i
entitled
a
horse
beginning
noble
animal
and
a
most
useful
possession
especially
in
war
and
you
may
get
on
his
back
and
fight
and
he
will
carry
baggage
or
anything
phaedrus
how
ridiculous
socrates
ridiculous
yes
but
is
not
even
a
ridiculous
friend
better
than
a
cunning
enemy
phaedrus
certainly
socrates
and
when
the
orator
instead
of
putting
an
ass
in
the
place
of
a
horse
puts
good
for
evil
being
himself
as
ignorant
of
their
true
nature
as
the
city
on
which
he
imposes
is
ignorant
and
having
studied
the
notions
of
the
multitude
falsely
persuades
them
not
about
shadow
of
an
ass
which
he
confounds
with
a
horse
but
about
good
which
he
confounds
with
evil
what
will
be
the
harvest
which
rhetoric
will
be
likely
to
gather
after
the
sowing
of
that
seed
phaedrus
the
reverse
of
good
socrates
but
perhaps
rhetoric
has
been
getting
too
roughly
handled
by
us
and
she
might
answer
what
amazing
nonsense
you
are
talking
as
if
i
forced
any
man
to
learn
to
speak
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
whatever
my
advice
may
be
worth
i
should
have
told
him
to
arrive
at
the
truth
first
and
then
come
to
me
at
the
same
time
i
boldly
assert
that
mere
knowledge
of
the
truth
will
not
give
you
the
art
of
persuasion
phaedrus
there
is
reason
in
the
lady
defence
of
herself
socrates
quite
true
if
only
the
other
arguments
which
remain
to
be
brought
up
bear
her
witness
that
she
is
an
art
at
all
but
i
seem
to
hear
them
arraying
themselves
on
the
opposite
side
declaring
that
she
speaks
falsely
and
that
rhetoric
is
a
mere
routine
and
trick
not
an
art
lo
a
spartan
appears
and
says
that
there
never
is
nor
ever
will
be
a
real
art
of
speaking
which
is
divorced
from
the
truth
phaedrus
and
what
are
these
arguments
socrates
bring
them
out
that
we
may
examine
them
socrates
come
out
fair
children
and
convince
phaedrus
who
is
the
father
of
similar
beauties
that
he
will
never
be
able
to
speak
about
anything
as
he
ought
to
speak
unless
he
have
a
knowledge
of
philosophy
and
let
phaedrus
answer
you
phaedrus
put
the
question
socrates
is
not
rhetoric
taken
generally
a
universal
art
of
enchanting
the
mind
by
arguments
which
is
practised
not
only
in
courts
and
public
assemblies
but
in
private
houses
also
having
to
do
with
all
matters
great
as
well
as
small
good
and
bad
alike
and
is
in
all
equally
right
and
equally
to
be
esteemed
that
is
what
you
have
heard
phaedrus
nay
not
exactly
that
i
should
say
rather
that
i
have
heard
the
art
confined
to
speaking
and
writing
in
lawsuits
and
to
speaking
in
public
assemblies
not
extended
farther
socrates
then
i
suppose
that
you
have
only
heard
of
the
rhetoric
of
nestor
and
odysseus
which
they
composed
in
their
leisure
hours
when
at
troy
and
never
of
the
rhetoric
of
palamedes
phaedrus
no
more
than
of
nestor
and
odysseus
unless
gorgias
is
your
nestor
and
thrasymachus
or
theodorus
your
odysseus
socrates
perhaps
that
is
my
meaning
but
let
us
leave
them
and
do
you
tell
me
instead
what
are
plaintiff
and
defendant
doing
in
a
law
court
are
they
not
contending
phaedrus
exactly
so
socrates
about
the
just
and
unjust
that
is
the
matter
in
dispute
phaedrus
yes
socrates
and
a
professor
of
the
art
will
make
the
same
thing
appear
to
the
same
persons
to
be
at
one
time
just
at
another
time
if
he
is
so
inclined
to
be
unjust
phaedrus
exactly
socrates
and
when
he
speaks
in
the
assembly
he
will
make
the
same
things
seem
good
to
the
city
at
one
time
and
at
another
time
the
reverse
of
good
phaedrus
that
is
true
socrates
have
we
not
heard
of
the
eleatic
palamedes
zeno
who
has
an
art
of
speaking
by
which
he
makes
the
same
things
appear
to
his
hearers
like
and
unlike
one
and
many
at
rest
and
in
motion
phaedrus
very
true
socrates
the
art
of
disputation
then
is
not
confined
to
the
courts
and
the
assembly
but
is
one
and
the
same
in
every
use
of
language
this
is
the
art
if
there
be
such
an
art
which
is
able
to
find
a
likeness
of
everything
to
which
a
likeness
can
be
found
and
draws
into
the
light
of
day
the
likenesses
and
disguises
which
are
used
by
others
phaedrus
how
do
you
mean
socrates
let
me
put
the
matter
thus
when
will
there
be
more
chance
of
deception
when
the
difference
is
large
or
small
phaedrus
when
the
difference
is
small
socrates
and
you
will
be
less
likely
to
be
discovered
in
passing
by
degrees
into
the
other
extreme
than
when
you
go
all
at
once
phaedrus
of
course
socrates
he
then
who
would
deceive
others
and
not
be
deceived
must
exactly
know
the
real
likenesses
and
differences
of
things
phaedrus
he
must
socrates
and
if
he
is
ignorant
of
the
true
nature
of
any
subject
how
can
he
detect
the
greater
or
less
degree
of
likeness
in
other
things
to
that
of
which
by
the
hypothesis
he
is
ignorant
phaedrus
he
can
not
socrates
and
when
men
are
deceived
and
their
notions
are
at
variance
with
realities
it
is
clear
that
the
error
slips
in
through
resemblances
phaedrus
yes
that
is
the
way
socrates
then
he
who
would
be
a
master
of
the
art
must
understand
the
real
nature
of
everything
or
he
will
never
know
either
how
to
make
the
gradual
departure
from
truth
into
the
opposite
of
truth
which
is
effected
by
the
help
of
resemblances
or
how
to
avoid
it
phaedrus
he
will
not
socrates
he
then
who
being
ignorant
of
the
truth
aims
at
appearances
will
only
attain
an
art
of
rhetoric
which
is
ridiculous
and
is
not
an
art
at
all
phaedrus
that
may
be
expected
socrates
shall
i
propose
that
we
look
for
examples
of
art
and
want
of
art
according
to
our
notion
of
them
in
the
speech
of
lysias
which
you
have
in
your
hand
and
in
my
own
speech
phaedrus
nothing
could
be
better
and
indeed
i
think
that
our
previous
argument
has
been
too
abstract
and
wanting
in
illustrations
socrates
yes
and
the
two
speeches
happen
to
afford
a
very
good
example
of
the
way
in
which
the
speaker
who
knows
the
truth
may
without
any
serious
purpose
steal
away
the
hearts
of
his
hearers
this
piece
of
i
attribute
to
the
local
deities
and
perhaps
the
prophets
of
the
muses
who
are
singing
over
our
heads
may
have
imparted
their
inspiration
to
me
for
i
do
not
imagine
that
i
have
any
rhetorical
art
of
my
own
phaedrus
granted
if
you
will
only
please
to
get
on
socrates
suppose
that
you
read
me
the
first
words
of
lysias
speech
phaedrus
know
how
matters
stand
with
me
and
how
as
i
conceive
they
might
be
arranged
for
our
common
interest
and
i
maintain
that
i
ought
not
to
fail
in
my
suit
because
i
am
not
your
lover
for
lovers
repent
socrates
enough
now
shall
i
point
out
the
rhetorical
error
of
those
words
phaedrus
yes
socrates
every
one
is
aware
that
about
some
things
we
are
agreed
whereas
about
other
things
we
differ
phaedrus
i
think
that
i
understand
you
but
will
you
explain
yourself
socrates
when
any
one
speaks
of
iron
and
silver
is
not
the
same
thing
present
in
the
minds
of
all
phaedrus
certainly
socrates
but
when
any
one
speaks
of
justice
and
goodness
we
part
company
and
are
at
odds
with
one
another
and
with
ourselves
phaedrus
precisely
socrates
then
in
some
things
we
agree
but
not
in
others
phaedrus
that
is
true
socrates
in
which
are
we
more
likely
to
be
deceived
and
in
which
has
rhetoric
the
greater
power
phaedrus
clearly
in
the
uncertain
class
socrates
then
the
rhetorician
ought
to
make
a
regular
division
and
acquire
a
distinct
notion
of
both
classes
as
well
of
that
in
which
the
many
err
as
of
that
in
which
they
do
not
err
phaedrus
he
who
made
such
a
distinction
would
have
an
excellent
principle
socrates
yes
and
in
the
next
place
he
must
have
a
keen
eye
for
the
observation
of
particulars
in
speaking
and
not
make
a
mistake
about
the
class
to
which
they
are
to
be
referred
phaedrus
certainly
socrates
now
to
which
class
does
love
belong
to
the
debatable
or
to
the
undisputed
class
phaedrus
to
the
debatable
clearly
for
if
not
do
you
think
that
love
would
have
allowed
you
to
say
as
you
did
that
he
is
an
evil
both
to
the
lover
and
the
beloved
and
also
the
greatest
possible
good
socrates
capital
but
will
you
tell
me
whether
i
defined
love
at
the
beginning
of
my
speech
for
having
been
in
an
ecstasy
i
can
not
well
remember
phaedrus
yes
indeed
that
you
did
and
no
mistake
socrates
then
i
perceive
that
the
nymphs
of
achelous
and
pan
the
son
of
hermes
who
inspired
me
were
far
better
rhetoricians
than
lysias
the
son
of
cephalus
alas
how
inferior
to
them
he
is
but
perhaps
i
am
mistaken
and
lysias
at
the
commencement
of
his
lover
speech
did
insist
on
our
supposing
love
to
be
something
or
other
which
he
fancied
him
to
be
and
according
to
this
model
he
fashioned
and
framed
the
remainder
of
his
discourse
suppose
we
read
his
beginning
over
again
phaedrus
if
you
please
but
you
will
not
find
what
you
want
socrates
read
that
i
may
have
his
exact
words
phaedrus
know
how
matters
stand
with
me
and
how
as
i
conceive
they
might
be
arranged
for
our
common
interest
and
i
maintain
i
ought
not
to
fail
in
my
suit
because
i
am
not
your
lover
for
lovers
repent
of
the
kindnesses
which
they
have
shown
when
their
love
is
over
socrates
here
he
appears
to
have
done
just
the
reverse
of
what
he
ought
for
he
has
begun
at
the
end
and
is
swimming
on
his
back
through
the
flood
to
the
place
of
starting
his
address
to
the
fair
youth
begins
where
the
lover
would
have
ended
am
i
not
right
sweet
phaedrus
phaedrus
yes
indeed
socrates
he
does
begin
at
the
end
socrates
then
as
to
the
other
topics
are
they
not
thrown
down
anyhow
is
there
any
principle
in
them
why
should
the
next
topic
follow
next
in
order
or
any
other
topic
i
can
not
help
fancying
in
my
ignorance
that
he
wrote
off
boldly
just
what
came
into
his
head
but
i
dare
say
that
you
would
recognize
a
rhetorical
necessity
in
the
succession
of
the
several
parts
of
the
composition
phaedrus
you
have
too
good
an
opinion
of
me
if
you
think
that
i
have
any
such
insight
into
his
principles
of
composition
socrates
at
any
rate
you
will
allow
that
every
discourse
ought
to
be
a
living
creature
having
a
body
of
its
own
and
a
head
and
feet
there
should
be
a
middle
beginning
and
end
adapted
to
one
another
and
to
the
whole
phaedrus
certainly
socrates
can
this
be
said
of
the
discourse
of
lysias
see
whether
you
can
find
any
more
connexion
in
his
words
than
in
the
epitaph
which
is
said
by
some
to
have
been
inscribed
on
the
grave
of
midas
the
phrygian
phaedrus
what
is
there
remarkable
in
the
epitaph
socrates
it
is
as
follows
am
a
maiden
of
bronze
and
lie
on
the
tomb
of
midas
so
long
as
water
flows
and
tall
trees
grow
so
long
here
on
this
spot
by
his
sad
tomb
abiding
i
shall
declare
to
that
midas
sleeps
below
now
in
this
rhyme
whether
a
line
comes
first
or
comes
last
as
you
will
perceive
makes
no
difference
phaedrus
you
are
making
fun
of
that
oration
of
ours
socrates
well
i
will
say
no
more
about
your
friend
speech
lest
i
should
give
offence
to
you
although
i
think
that
it
might
furnish
many
other
examples
of
what
a
man
ought
rather
to
avoid
but
i
will
proceed
to
the
other
speech
which
as
i
think
is
also
suggestive
to
students
of
rhetoric
phaedrus
in
what
way
socrates
the
two
speeches
as
you
may
remember
were
unlike
the
one
argued
that
the
lover
and
the
other
that
the
ought
to
be
accepted
phaedrus
and
right
manfully
socrates
you
should
rather
say
and
madness
was
the
argument
of
them
for
as
i
said
is
a
madness
phaedrus
yes
socrates
and
of
madness
there
were
two
kinds
one
produced
by
human
infirmity
the
other
was
a
divine
release
of
the
soul
from
the
yoke
of
custom
and
convention
phaedrus
true
socrates
the
divine
madness
was
subdivided
into
four
kinds
prophetic
initiatory
poetic
erotic
having
four
gods
presiding
over
them
the
first
was
the
inspiration
of
apollo
the
second
that
of
dionysus
the
third
that
of
the
muses
the
fourth
that
of
aphrodite
and
eros
in
the
description
of
the
last
kind
of
madness
which
was
also
said
to
be
the
best
we
spoke
of
the
affection
of
love
in
a
figure
into
which
we
introduced
a
tolerably
credible
and
possibly
true
though
partly
erring
myth
which
was
also
a
hymn
in
honour
of
love
who
is
your
lord
and
also
mine
phaedrus
and
the
guardian
of
fair
children
and
to
him
we
sung
the
hymn
in
measured
and
solemn
strain
phaedrus
i
know
that
i
had
great
pleasure
in
listening
to
you
socrates
let
us
take
this
instance
and
note
how
the
transition
was
made
from
blame
to
praise
phaedrus
what
do
you
mean
socrates
i
mean
to
say
that
the
composition
was
mostly
playful
yet
in
these
chance
fancies
of
the
hour
were
involved
two
principles
of
which
we
should
be
too
glad
to
have
a
clearer
description
if
art
could
give
us
one
phaedrus
what
are
they
socrates
first
the
comprehension
of
scattered
particulars
in
one
idea
as
in
our
definition
of
love
which
whether
true
or
false
certainly
gave
clearness
and
consistency
to
the
discourse
the
speaker
should
define
his
several
notions
and
so
make
his
meaning
clear
phaedrus
what
is
the
other
principle
socrates
socrates
the
second
principle
is
that
of
division
into
species
according
to
the
natural
formation
where
the
joint
is
not
breaking
any
part
as
a
bad
carver
might
just
as
our
two
discourses
alike
assumed
first
of
all
a
single
form
of
unreason
and
then
as
the
body
which
from
being
one
becomes
double
and
may
be
divided
into
a
left
side
and
right
side
each
having
parts
right
and
left
of
the
same
name
after
this
manner
the
speaker
proceeded
to
divide
the
parts
of
the
left
side
and
did
not
desist
until
he
found
in
them
an
evil
or
love
which
he
justly
reviled
and
the
other
discourse
leading
us
to
the
madness
which
lay
on
the
right
side
found
another
love
also
having
the
same
name
but
divine
which
the
speaker
held
up
before
us
and
applauded
and
affirmed
to
be
the
author
of
the
greatest
benefits
phaedrus
most
true
socrates
i
am
myself
a
great
lover
of
these
processes
of
division
and
generalization
they
help
me
to
speak
and
to
think
and
if
i
find
any
man
who
is
able
to
see
one
and
many
in
nature
him
i
follow
and
in
his
footsteps
as
if
he
were
a
god
and
those
who
have
this
art
i
have
hitherto
been
in
the
habit
of
calling
dialecticians
but
god
knows
whether
the
name
is
right
or
not
and
i
should
like
to
know
what
name
you
would
give
to
your
or
to
lysias
disciples
and
whether
this
may
not
be
that
famous
art
of
rhetoric
which
thrasymachus
and
others
teach
and
practise
skilful
speakers
they
are
and
impart
their
skill
to
any
who
is
willing
to
make
kings
of
them
and
to
bring
gifts
to
them
phaedrus
yes
they
are
royal
men
but
their
art
is
not
the
same
with
the
art
of
those
whom
you
call
and
rightly
in
my
opinion
dialecticians
still
we
are
in
the
dark
about
rhetoric
socrates
what
do
you
mean
the
remains
of
it
if
there
be
anything
remaining
which
can
be
brought
under
rules
of
art
must
be
a
fine
thing
and
at
any
rate
is
not
to
be
despised
by
you
and
me
but
how
much
is
left
phaedrus
there
is
a
great
deal
surely
to
be
found
in
books
of
rhetoric
socrates
yes
thank
you
for
reminding
me
there
is
the
exordium
showing
how
the
speech
should
begin
if
i
remember
rightly
that
is
what
you
mean
the
niceties
of
the
art
phaedrus
yes
socrates
then
follows
the
statement
of
facts
and
upon
that
witnesses
thirdly
proofs
fourthly
probabilities
are
to
come
the
great
byzantian
also
speaks
if
i
am
not
mistaken
of
confirmation
and
further
confirmation
phaedrus
you
mean
the
excellent
theodorus
socrates
yes
and
he
tells
how
refutation
or
further
refutation
is
to
be
managed
whether
in
accusation
or
defence
i
ought
also
to
mention
the
illustrious
parian
evenus
who
first
invented
insinuations
and
indirect
praises
and
also
indirect
censures
which
according
to
some
he
put
into
verse
to
help
the
memory
but
shall
i
dumb
forgetfulness
consign
tisias
and
gorgias
who
are
not
ignorant
that
probability
is
superior
to
truth
and
who
by
force
of
argument
make
the
little
appear
great
and
the
great
little
disguise
the
new
in
old
fashions
and
the
old
in
new
fashions
and
have
discovered
forms
for
everything
either
short
or
going
on
to
infinity
i
remember
prodicus
laughing
when
i
told
him
of
this
he
said
that
he
had
himself
discovered
the
true
rule
of
art
which
was
to
be
neither
long
nor
short
but
of
a
convenient
length
phaedrus
well
done
prodicus
socrates
then
there
is
hippias
the
elean
stranger
who
probably
agrees
with
him
phaedrus
yes
socrates
and
there
is
also
polus
who
has
treasuries
of
diplasiology
and
gnomology
and
eikonology
and
who
teaches
in
them
the
names
of
which
licymnius
made
him
a
present
they
were
to
give
a
polish
phaedrus
had
not
protagoras
something
of
the
same
sort
socrates
yes
rules
of
correct
diction
and
many
other
fine
precepts
for
the
of
a
poor
old
man
or
any
other
pathetic
case
no
one
is
better
than
the
chalcedonian
giant
he
can
put
a
whole
company
of
people
into
a
passion
and
out
of
one
again
by
his
mighty
magic
and
is
at
inventing
or
disposing
of
any
sort
of
calumny
on
any
grounds
or
none
all
of
them
agree
in
asserting
that
a
speech
should
end
in
a
recapitulation
though
they
do
not
all
agree
to
use
the
same
word
phaedrus
you
mean
that
there
should
be
a
summing
up
of
the
arguments
in
order
to
remind
the
hearers
of
them
socrates
i
have
now
said
all
that
i
have
to
say
of
the
art
of
rhetoric
have
you
anything
to
add
phaedrus
not
much
nothing
very
important
socrates
leave
the
unimportant
and
let
us
bring
the
really
important
question
into
the
light
of
day
which
is
what
power
has
this
art
of
rhetoric
and
when
phaedrus
a
very
great
power
in
public
meetings
socrates
it
has
but
i
should
like
to
know
whether
you
have
the
same
feeling
as
i
have
about
the
rhetoricians
to
me
there
seem
to
be
a
great
many
holes
in
their
web
phaedrus
give
an
example
socrates
i
will
suppose
a
person
to
come
to
your
friend
eryximachus
or
to
his
father
acumenus
and
to
say
to
him
know
how
to
apply
drugs
which
shall
have
either
a
heating
or
a
cooling
effect
and
i
can
give
a
vomit
and
also
a
purge
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
knowing
all
this
as
i
do
i
claim
to
be
a
physician
and
to
make
physicians
by
imparting
this
knowledge
to
others
what
do
you
suppose
that
they
would
say
phaedrus
they
would
be
sure
to
ask
him
whether
he
knew
whom
he
would
give
his
medicines
and
and
much
socrates
and
suppose
that
he
were
to
reply
i
know
nothing
of
all
that
i
expect
the
patient
who
consults
me
to
be
able
to
do
these
things
for
himself
phaedrus
they
would
say
in
reply
that
he
is
a
madman
or
a
pedant
who
fancies
that
he
is
a
physician
because
he
has
read
something
in
a
book
or
has
stumbled
on
a
prescription
or
two
although
he
has
no
real
understanding
of
the
art
of
medicine
socrates
and
suppose
a
person
were
to
come
to
sophocles
or
euripides
and
say
that
he
knows
how
to
make
a
very
long
speech
about
a
small
matter
and
a
short
speech
about
a
great
matter
and
also
a
sorrowful
speech
or
a
terrible
or
threatening
speech
or
any
other
kind
of
speech
and
in
teaching
this
fancies
that
he
is
teaching
the
art
of
tragedy
phaedrus
they
too
would
surely
laugh
at
him
if
he
fancies
that
tragedy
is
anything
but
the
arranging
of
these
elements
in
a
manner
which
will
be
suitable
to
one
another
and
to
the
whole
socrates
but
i
do
not
suppose
that
they
would
be
rude
or
abusive
to
him
would
they
not
treat
him
as
a
musician
a
man
who
thinks
that
he
is
a
harmonist
because
he
knows
how
to
pitch
the
highest
and
lowest
note
happening
to
meet
such
an
one
he
would
not
say
to
him
savagely
you
are
mad
but
like
a
musician
in
a
gentle
and
harmonious
tone
of
voice
he
would
answer
good
friend
he
who
would
be
a
harmonist
must
certainly
know
this
and
yet
he
may
understand
nothing
of
harmony
if
he
has
not
got
beyond
your
stage
of
knowledge
for
you
only
know
the
preliminaries
of
harmony
and
not
harmony
itself
phaedrus
very
true
socrates
and
will
not
sophocles
say
to
the
display
of
the
tragedian
that
this
is
not
tragedy
but
the
preliminaries
of
tragedy
and
will
not
acumenus
say
the
same
of
medicine
to
the
physician
phaedrus
quite
true
socrates
and
if
adrastus
the
mellifluous
or
pericles
heard
of
these
wonderful
arts
brachylogies
and
eikonologies
and
all
the
hard
names
which
we
have
been
endeavouring
to
draw
into
the
light
of
day
what
would
they
say
instead
of
losing
temper
and
applying
uncomplimentary
epithets
as
you
and
i
have
been
doing
to
the
authors
of
such
an
imaginary
art
their
superior
wisdom
would
rather
censure
us
as
well
as
them
a
little
patience
phaedrus
and
socrates
they
would
say
you
should
not
be
in
such
a
passion
with
those
who
from
some
want
of
dialectical
skill
are
unable
to
define
the
nature
of
rhetoric
and
consequently
suppose
that
they
have
found
the
art
in
the
preliminary
conditions
of
it
and
when
these
have
been
taught
by
them
to
others
fancy
that
the
whole
art
of
rhetoric
has
been
taught
by
them
but
as
to
using
the
several
instruments
of
the
art
effectively
or
making
the
composition
a
whole
an
application
of
it
such
as
this
is
they
regard
as
an
easy
thing
which
their
disciples
may
make
for
themselves
phaedrus
i
quite
admit
socrates
that
the
art
of
rhetoric
which
these
men
teach
and
of
which
they
write
is
such
as
you
describe
there
i
agree
with
you
but
i
still
want
to
know
where
and
how
the
true
art
of
rhetoric
and
persuasion
is
to
be
acquired
socrates
the
perfection
which
is
required
of
the
finished
orator
is
or
rather
must
be
like
the
perfection
of
anything
else
partly
given
by
nature
but
may
also
be
assisted
by
art
if
you
have
the
natural
power
and
add
to
it
knowledge
and
practice
you
will
be
a
distinguished
speaker
if
you
fall
short
in
either
of
these
you
will
be
to
that
extent
defective
but
the
art
as
far
as
there
is
an
art
of
rhetoric
does
not
lie
in
the
direction
of
lysias
or
thrasymachus
phaedrus
in
what
direction
then
socrates
i
conceive
pericles
to
have
been
the
most
accomplished
of
rhetoricians
phaedrus
what
of
that
socrates
all
the
great
arts
require
discussion
and
high
speculation
about
the
truths
of
nature
hence
come
loftiness
of
thought
and
completeness
of
execution
and
this
as
i
conceive
was
the
quality
which
in
addition
to
his
natural
gifts
pericles
acquired
from
his
intercourse
with
anaxagoras
whom
he
happened
to
know
he
was
thus
imbued
with
the
higher
philosophy
and
attained
the
knowledge
of
mind
and
the
negative
of
mind
which
were
favourite
themes
of
anaxagoras
and
applied
what
suited
his
purpose
to
the
art
of
speaking
phaedrus
explain
socrates
rhetoric
is
like
medicine
phaedrus
how
so
socrates
why
because
medicine
has
to
define
the
nature
of
the
body
and
rhetoric
of
the
soul
if
we
would
proceed
not
empirically
but
scientifically
in
the
one
case
to
impart
health
and
strength
by
giving
medicine
and
food
in
the
other
to
implant
the
conviction
or
virtue
which
you
desire
by
the
right
application
of
words
and
training
phaedrus
there
socrates
i
suspect
that
you
are
right
socrates
and
do
you
think
that
you
can
know
the
nature
of
the
soul
intelligently
without
knowing
the
nature
of
the
whole
phaedrus
hippocrates
the
asclepiad
says
that
the
nature
even
of
the
body
can
only
be
understood
as
a
whole
compare
charmides
socrates
yes
friend
and
he
was
right
still
we
ought
not
to
be
content
with
the
name
of
hippocrates
but
to
examine
and
see
whether
his
argument
agrees
with
his
conception
of
nature
phaedrus
i
agree
socrates
then
consider
what
truth
as
well
as
hippocrates
says
about
this
or
about
any
other
nature
ought
we
not
to
consider
first
whether
that
which
we
wish
to
learn
and
to
teach
is
a
simple
or
multiform
thing
and
if
simple
then
to
enquire
what
power
it
has
of
acting
or
being
acted
upon
in
relation
to
other
things
and
if
multiform
then
to
number
the
forms
and
see
first
in
the
case
of
one
of
them
and
then
in
the
case
of
all
of
them
what
is
that
power
of
acting
or
being
acted
upon
which
makes
each
and
all
of
them
to
be
what
they
are
phaedrus
you
may
very
likely
be
right
socrates
socrates
the
method
which
proceeds
without
analysis
is
like
the
groping
of
a
blind
man
yet
surely
he
who
is
an
artist
ought
not
to
admit
of
a
comparison
with
the
blind
or
deaf
the
rhetorician
who
teaches
his
pupil
to
speak
scientifically
will
particularly
set
forth
the
nature
of
that
being
to
which
he
addresses
his
speeches
and
this
i
conceive
to
be
the
soul
phaedrus
certainly
socrates
his
whole
effort
is
directed
to
the
soul
for
in
that
he
seeks
to
produce
conviction
phaedrus
yes
socrates
then
clearly
thrasymachus
or
any
one
else
who
teaches
rhetoric
in
earnest
will
give
an
exact
description
of
the
nature
of
the
soul
which
will
enable
us
to
see
whether
she
be
single
and
same
or
like
the
body
multiform
that
is
what
we
should
call
showing
the
nature
of
the
soul
phaedrus
exactly
socrates
he
will
explain
secondly
the
mode
in
which
she
acts
or
is
acted
upon
phaedrus
true
socrates
thirdly
having
classified
men
and
speeches
and
their
kinds
and
affections
and
adapted
them
to
one
another
he
will
tell
the
reasons
of
his
arrangement
and
show
why
one
soul
is
persuaded
by
a
particular
form
of
argument
and
another
not
phaedrus
you
have
hit
upon
a
very
good
way
socrates
yes
that
is
the
true
and
only
way
in
which
any
subject
can
be
set
forth
or
treated
by
rules
of
art
whether
in
speaking
or
writing
but
the
writers
of
the
present
day
at
whose
feet
you
have
sat
craftily
conceal
the
nature
of
the
soul
which
they
know
quite
well
nor
until
they
adopt
our
method
of
reading
and
writing
can
we
admit
that
they
write
by
rules
of
art
phaedrus
what
is
our
method
socrates
i
can
not
give
you
the
exact
details
but
i
should
like
to
tell
you
generally
as
far
as
is
in
my
power
how
a
man
ought
to
proceed
according
to
rules
of
art
phaedrus
let
me
hear
socrates
oratory
is
the
art
of
enchanting
the
soul
and
therefore
he
who
would
be
an
orator
has
to
learn
the
differences
of
human
souls
they
are
so
many
and
of
such
a
nature
and
from
them
come
the
differences
between
man
and
man
having
proceeded
thus
far
in
his
analysis
he
will
next
divide
speeches
into
their
different
classes
and
such
persons
he
will
say
are
affected
by
this
or
that
kind
of
speech
in
this
or
that
way
and
he
will
tell
you
why
the
pupil
must
have
a
good
theoretical
notion
of
them
first
and
then
he
must
have
experience
of
them
in
actual
life
and
be
able
to
follow
them
with
all
his
senses
about
him
or
he
will
never
get
beyond
the
precepts
of
his
masters
but
when
he
understands
what
persons
are
persuaded
by
what
arguments
and
sees
the
person
about
whom
he
was
speaking
in
the
abstract
actually
before
him
and
knows
that
it
is
he
and
can
say
to
himself
is
the
man
or
this
is
the
character
who
ought
to
have
a
certain
argument
applied
to
him
in
order
to
convince
him
of
a
certain
opinion
he
who
knows
all
this
and
knows
also
when
he
should
speak
and
when
he
should
refrain
and
when
he
should
use
pithy
sayings
pathetic
appeals
sensational
effects
and
all
the
other
modes
of
speech
which
he
has
learned
when
i
say
he
knows
the
times
and
seasons
of
all
these
things
then
and
not
till
then
he
is
a
perfect
master
of
his
art
but
if
he
fail
in
any
of
these
points
whether
in
speaking
or
teaching
or
writing
them
and
yet
declares
that
he
speaks
by
rules
of
art
he
who
says
do
believe
you
has
the
better
of
him
well
the
teacher
will
say
is
this
phaedrus
and
socrates
your
account
of
the
art
of
rhetoric
or
am
i
to
look
for
another
phaedrus
he
must
take
this
socrates
for
there
is
no
possibility
of
another
and
yet
the
creation
of
such
an
art
is
not
easy
socrates
very
true
and
therefore
let
us
consider
this
matter
in
every
light
and
see
whether
we
can
not
find
a
shorter
and
easier
road
there
is
no
use
in
taking
a
long
rough
roundabout
way
if
there
be
a
shorter
and
easier
one
and
i
wish
that
you
would
try
and
remember
whether
you
have
heard
from
lysias
or
any
one
else
anything
which
might
be
of
service
to
us
phaedrus
if
trying
would
avail
then
i
might
but
at
the
moment
i
can
think
of
nothing
socrates
suppose
i
tell
you
something
which
somebody
who
knows
told
me
phaedrus
certainly
socrates
may
not
wolf
as
the
proverb
says
a
hearing
phaedrus
do
you
say
what
can
be
said
for
him
socrates
he
will
argue
that
there
is
no
use
in
putting
a
solemn
face
on
these
matters
or
in
going
round
and
round
until
you
arrive
at
first
principles
for
as
i
said
at
first
when
the
question
is
of
justice
and
good
or
is
a
question
in
which
men
are
concerned
who
are
just
and
good
either
by
nature
or
habit
he
who
would
be
a
skilful
rhetorician
has
no
need
of
truth
for
that
in
courts
of
law
men
literally
care
nothing
about
truth
but
only
about
conviction
and
this
is
based
on
probability
to
which
he
who
would
be
a
skilful
orator
should
therefore
give
his
whole
attention
and
they
say
also
that
there
are
cases
in
which
the
actual
facts
if
they
are
improbable
ought
to
be
withheld
and
only
the
probabilities
should
be
told
either
in
accusation
or
defence
and
that
always
in
speaking
the
orator
should
keep
probability
in
view
and
say
to
the
truth
and
the
observance
of
this
principle
throughout
a
speech
furnishes
the
whole
art
phaedrus
that
is
what
the
professors
of
rhetoric
do
actually
say
socrates
i
have
not
forgotten
that
we
have
quite
briefly
touched
upon
this
matter
already
with
them
the
point
is
socrates
i
dare
say
that
you
are
familiar
with
tisias
does
he
not
define
probability
to
be
that
which
the
many
think
phaedrus
certainly
he
does
socrates
i
believe
that
he
has
a
clever
and
ingenious
case
of
this
sort
he
supposes
a
feeble
and
valiant
man
to
have
assaulted
a
strong
and
cowardly
one
and
to
have
robbed
him
of
his
coat
or
of
something
or
other
he
is
brought
into
court
and
then
tisias
says
that
both
parties
should
tell
lies
the
coward
should
say
that
he
was
assaulted
by
more
men
than
one
the
other
should
prove
that
they
were
alone
and
should
argue
thus
could
a
weak
man
like
me
have
assaulted
a
strong
man
like
him
the
complainant
will
not
like
to
confess
his
own
cowardice
and
will
therefore
invent
some
other
lie
which
his
adversary
will
thus
gain
an
opportunity
of
refuting
and
there
are
other
devices
of
the
same
kind
which
have
a
place
in
the
system
am
i
not
right
phaedrus
phaedrus
certainly
socrates
bless
me
what
a
wonderfully
mysterious
art
is
this
which
tisias
or
some
other
gentleman
in
whatever
name
or
country
he
rejoices
has
discovered
shall
we
say
a
word
to
him
or
not
phaedrus
what
shall
we
say
to
him
socrates
let
us
tell
him
that
before
he
appeared
you
and
i
were
saying
that
the
probability
of
which
he
speaks
was
engendered
in
the
minds
of
the
many
by
the
likeness
of
the
truth
and
we
had
just
been
affirming
that
he
who
knew
the
truth
would
always
know
best
how
to
discover
the
resemblances
of
the
truth
if
he
has
anything
else
to
say
about
the
art
of
speaking
we
should
like
to
hear
him
but
if
not
we
are
satisfied
with
our
own
view
that
unless
a
man
estimates
the
various
characters
of
his
hearers
and
is
able
to
divide
all
things
into
classes
and
to
comprehend
them
under
single
ideas
he
will
never
be
a
skilful
rhetorician
even
within
the
limits
of
human
power
and
this
skill
he
will
not
attain
without
a
great
deal
of
trouble
which
a
good
man
ought
to
undergo
not
for
the
sake
of
speaking
and
acting
before
men
but
in
order
that
he
may
be
able
to
say
what
is
acceptable
to
god
and
always
to
act
acceptably
to
him
as
far
as
in
him
lies
for
there
is
a
saying
of
wiser
men
than
ourselves
that
a
man
of
sense
should
not
try
to
please
his
at
least
this
should
not
be
his
first
object
but
his
good
and
noble
masters
and
therefore
if
the
way
is
long
and
circuitous
marvel
not
at
this
for
where
the
end
is
great
there
we
may
take
the
longer
road
but
not
for
lesser
ends
such
as
yours
truly
the
argument
may
say
tisias
that
if
you
do
not
mind
going
so
far
rhetoric
has
a
fair
beginning
here
phaedrus
i
think
socrates
that
this
is
admirable
if
only
practicable
socrates
but
even
to
fail
in
an
honourable
object
is
honourable
phaedrus
true
socrates
enough
appears
to
have
been
said
by
us
of
a
true
and
false
art
of
speaking
phaedrus
certainly
socrates
but
there
is
something
yet
to
be
said
of
propriety
and
impropriety
of
writing
phaedrus
yes
socrates
do
you
know
how
you
can
speak
or
act
about
rhetoric
in
a
manner
which
will
be
acceptable
to
god
phaedrus
no
indeed
do
you
socrates
i
have
heard
a
tradition
of
the
ancients
whether
true
or
not
they
only
know
although
if
we
had
found
the
truth
ourselves
do
you
think
that
we
should
care
much
about
the
opinions
of
men
phaedrus
your
question
needs
no
answer
but
i
wish
that
you
would
tell
me
what
you
say
that
you
have
heard
socrates
at
the
egyptian
city
of
naucratis
there
was
a
famous
old
god
whose
name
was
theuth
the
bird
which
is
called
the
ibis
is
sacred
to
him
and
he
was
the
inventor
of
many
arts
such
as
arithmetic
and
calculation
and
geometry
and
astronomy
and
draughts
and
dice
but
his
great
discovery
was
the
use
of
letters
now
in
those
days
the
god
thamus
was
the
king
of
the
whole
country
of
egypt
and
he
dwelt
in
that
great
city
of
upper
egypt
which
the
hellenes
call
egyptian
thebes
and
the
god
himself
is
called
by
them
ammon
to
him
came
theuth
and
showed
his
inventions
desiring
that
the
other
egyptians
might
be
allowed
to
have
the
benefit
of
them
he
enumerated
them
and
thamus
enquired
about
their
several
uses
and
praised
some
of
them
and
censured
others
as
he
approved
or
disapproved
of
them
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
repeat
all
that
thamus
said
to
theuth
in
praise
or
blame
of
the
various
arts
but
when
they
came
to
letters
this
said
theuth
will
make
the
egyptians
wiser
and
give
them
better
memories
it
is
a
specific
both
for
the
memory
and
for
the
wit
thamus
replied
o
most
ingenious
theuth
the
parent
or
inventor
of
an
art
is
not
always
the
best
judge
of
the
utility
or
inutility
of
his
own
inventions
to
the
users
of
them
and
in
this
instance
you
who
are
the
father
of
letters
from
a
paternal
love
of
your
own
children
have
been
led
to
attribute
to
them
a
quality
which
they
can
not
have
for
this
discovery
of
yours
will
create
forgetfulness
in
the
learners
souls
because
they
will
not
use
their
memories
they
will
trust
to
the
external
written
characters
and
not
remember
of
themselves
the
specific
which
you
have
discovered
is
an
aid
not
to
memory
but
to
reminiscence
and
you
give
your
disciples
not
truth
but
only
the
semblance
of
truth
they
will
be
hearers
of
many
things
and
will
have
learned
nothing
they
will
appear
to
be
omniscient
and
will
generally
know
nothing
they
will
be
tiresome
company
having
the
show
of
wisdom
without
the
reality
phaedrus
yes
socrates
you
can
easily
invent
tales
of
egypt
or
of
any
other
country
socrates
there
was
a
tradition
in
the
temple
of
dodona
that
oaks
first
gave
prophetic
utterances
the
men
of
old
unlike
in
their
simplicity
to
young
philosophy
deemed
that
if
they
heard
the
truth
even
from
or
rock
it
was
enough
for
them
whereas
you
seem
to
consider
not
whether
a
thing
is
or
is
not
true
but
who
the
speaker
is
and
from
what
country
the
tale
comes
phaedrus
i
acknowledge
the
justice
of
your
rebuke
and
i
think
that
the
theban
is
right
in
his
view
about
letters
socrates
he
would
be
a
very
simple
person
and
quite
a
stranger
to
the
oracles
of
thamus
or
ammon
who
should
leave
in
writing
or
receive
in
writing
any
art
under
the
idea
that
the
written
word
would
be
intelligible
or
certain
or
who
deemed
that
writing
was
at
all
better
than
knowledge
and
recollection
of
the
same
matters
phaedrus
that
is
most
true
socrates
i
can
not
help
feeling
phaedrus
that
writing
is
unfortunately
like
painting
for
the
creations
of
the
painter
have
the
attitude
of
life
and
yet
if
you
ask
them
a
question
they
preserve
a
solemn
silence
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
speeches
you
would
imagine
that
they
had
intelligence
but
if
you
want
to
know
anything
and
put
a
question
to
one
of
them
the
speaker
always
gives
one
unvarying
answer
and
when
they
have
been
once
written
down
they
are
tumbled
about
anywhere
among
those
who
may
or
may
not
understand
them
and
know
not
to
whom
they
should
reply
to
whom
not
and
if
they
are
maltreated
or
abused
they
have
no
parent
to
protect
them
and
they
can
not
protect
or
defend
themselves
phaedrus
that
again
is
most
true
socrates
is
there
not
another
kind
of
word
or
speech
far
better
than
this
and
having
far
greater
power
a
son
of
the
same
family
but
lawfully
begotten
phaedrus
whom
do
you
mean
and
what
is
his
origin
socrates
i
mean
an
intelligent
word
graven
in
the
soul
of
the
learner
which
can
defend
itself
and
knows
when
to
speak
and
when
to
be
silent
phaedrus
you
mean
the
living
word
of
knowledge
which
has
a
soul
and
of
which
the
written
word
is
properly
no
more
than
an
image
socrates
yes
of
course
that
is
what
i
mean
and
now
may
i
be
allowed
to
ask
you
a
question
would
a
husbandman
who
is
a
man
of
sense
take
the
seeds
which
he
values
and
which
he
wishes
to
bear
fruit
and
in
sober
seriousness
plant
them
during
the
heat
of
summer
in
some
garden
of
adonis
that
he
may
rejoice
when
he
sees
them
in
eight
days
appearing
in
beauty
at
least
he
would
do
so
if
at
all
only
for
the
sake
of
amusement
and
pastime
but
when
he
is
in
earnest
he
sows
in
fitting
soil
and
practises
husbandry
and
is
satisfied
if
in
eight
months
the
seeds
which
he
has
sown
arrive
at
perfection
phaedrus
yes
socrates
that
will
be
his
way
when
he
is
in
earnest
he
will
do
the
other
as
you
say
only
in
play
socrates
and
can
we
suppose
that
he
who
knows
the
just
and
good
and
honourable
has
less
understanding
than
the
husbandman
about
his
own
seeds
phaedrus
certainly
not
socrates
then
he
will
not
seriously
incline
to
his
thoughts
water
with
pen
and
ink
sowing
words
which
can
neither
speak
for
themselves
nor
teach
the
truth
adequately
to
others
phaedrus
no
that
is
not
likely
socrates
no
that
is
not
likely
in
the
garden
of
letters
he
will
sow
and
plant
but
only
for
the
sake
of
recreation
and
amusement
he
will
write
them
down
as
memorials
to
be
treasured
against
the
forgetfulness
of
old
age
by
himself
or
by
any
other
old
man
who
is
treading
the
same
path
he
will
rejoice
in
beholding
their
tender
growth
and
while
others
are
refreshing
their
souls
with
banqueting
and
the
like
this
will
be
the
pastime
in
which
his
days
are
spent
phaedrus
a
pastime
socrates
as
noble
as
the
other
is
ignoble
the
pastime
of
a
man
who
can
be
amused
by
serious
talk
and
can
discourse
merrily
about
justice
and
the
like
socrates
true
phaedrus
but
nobler
far
is
the
serious
pursuit
of
the
dialectician
who
finding
a
congenial
soul
by
the
help
of
science
sows
and
plants
therein
words
which
are
able
to
help
themselves
and
him
who
planted
them
and
are
not
unfruitful
but
have
in
them
a
seed
which
others
brought
up
in
different
soils
render
immortal
making
the
possessors
of
it
happy
to
the
utmost
extent
of
human
happiness
phaedrus
far
nobler
certainly
socrates
and
now
phaedrus
having
agreed
upon
the
premises
we
may
decide
about
the
conclusion
phaedrus
about
what
conclusion
socrates
about
lysias
whom
we
censured
and
his
art
of
writing
and
his
discourses
and
the
rhetorical
skill
or
want
of
skill
which
was
shown
in
them
these
are
the
questions
which
we
sought
to
determine
and
they
brought
us
to
this
point
and
i
think
that
we
are
now
pretty
well
informed
about
the
nature
of
art
and
its
opposite
phaedrus
yes
i
think
with
you
but
i
wish
that
you
would
repeat
what
was
said
socrates
until
a
man
knows
the
truth
of
the
several
particulars
of
which
he
is
writing
or
speaking
and
is
able
to
define
them
as
they
are
and
having
defined
them
again
to
divide
them
until
they
can
be
no
longer
divided
and
until
in
like
manner
he
is
able
to
discern
the
nature
of
the
soul
and
discover
the
different
modes
of
discourse
which
are
adapted
to
different
natures
and
to
arrange
and
dispose
them
in
such
a
way
that
the
simple
form
of
speech
may
be
addressed
to
the
simpler
nature
and
the
complex
and
composite
to
the
more
complex
nature
until
he
has
accomplished
all
this
he
will
be
unable
to
handle
arguments
according
to
rules
of
art
as
far
as
their
nature
allows
them
to
be
subjected
to
art
either
for
the
purpose
of
teaching
or
persuading
such
is
the
view
which
is
implied
in
the
whole
preceding
argument
phaedrus
yes
that
was
our
view
certainly
socrates
secondly
as
to
the
censure
which
was
passed
on
the
speaking
or
writing
of
discourses
and
how
they
might
be
rightly
or
wrongly
censured
did
not
our
previous
argument
show
phaedrus
show
what
socrates
that
whether
lysias
or
any
other
writer
that
ever
was
or
will
be
whether
private
man
or
statesman
proposes
laws
and
so
becomes
the
author
of
a
political
treatise
fancying
that
there
is
any
great
certainty
and
clearness
in
his
performance
the
fact
of
his
so
writing
is
only
a
disgrace
to
him
whatever
men
may
say
for
not
to
know
the
nature
of
justice
and
injustice
and
good
and
evil
and
not
to
be
able
to
distinguish
the
dream
from
the
reality
can
not
in
truth
be
otherwise
than
disgraceful
to
him
even
though
he
have
the
applause
of
the
whole
world
phaedrus
certainly
socrates
but
he
who
thinks
that
in
the
written
word
there
is
necessarily
much
which
is
not
serious
and
that
neither
poetry
nor
prose
spoken
or
written
is
of
any
great
value
if
like
the
compositions
of
the
rhapsodes
they
are
only
recited
in
order
to
be
believed
and
not
with
any
view
to
criticism
or
instruction
and
who
thinks
that
even
the
best
of
writings
are
but
a
reminiscence
of
what
we
know
and
that
only
in
principles
of
justice
and
goodness
and
nobility
taught
and
communicated
orally
for
the
sake
of
instruction
and
graven
in
the
soul
which
is
the
true
way
of
writing
is
there
clearness
and
perfection
and
seriousness
and
that
such
principles
are
a
man
own
and
his
legitimate
offspring
being
in
the
first
place
the
word
which
he
finds
in
his
own
bosom
secondly
the
brethren
and
descendants
and
relations
of
his
idea
which
have
been
duly
implanted
by
him
in
the
souls
of
others
and
who
cares
for
them
and
no
others
this
is
the
right
sort
of
man
and
you
and
i
phaedrus
would
pray
that
we
may
become
like
him
phaedrus
that
is
most
assuredly
my
desire
and
prayer
socrates
and
now
the
play
is
played
out
and
of
rhetoric
enough
go
and
tell
lysias
that
to
the
fountain
and
school
of
the
nymphs
we
went
down
and
were
bidden
by
them
to
convey
a
message
to
him
and
to
other
composers
of
speeches
to
homer
and
other
writers
of
poems
whether
set
to
music
or
not
and
to
solon
and
others
who
have
composed
writings
in
the
form
of
political
discourses
which
they
would
term
laws
to
all
of
them
we
are
to
say
that
if
their
compositions
are
based
on
knowledge
of
the
truth
and
they
can
defend
or
prove
them
when
they
are
put
to
the
test
by
spoken
arguments
which
leave
their
writings
poor
in
comparison
of
them
then
they
are
to
be
called
not
only
poets
orators
legislators
but
are
worthy
of
a
higher
name
befitting
the
serious
pursuit
of
their
life
phaedrus
what
name
would
you
assign
to
them
socrates
wise
i
may
not
call
them
for
that
is
a
great
name
which
belongs
to
god
alone
lovers
of
wisdom
or
philosophers
is
their
modest
and
befitting
title
phaedrus
very
suitable
socrates
and
he
who
can
not
rise
above
his
own
compilations
and
compositions
which
he
has
been
long
patching
and
piecing
adding
some
and
taking
away
some
may
be
justly
called
poet
or
or
phaedrus
certainly
socrates
now
go
and
tell
this
to
your
companion
phaedrus
but
there
is
also
a
friend
of
yours
who
ought
not
to
be
forgotten
socrates
who
is
he
phaedrus
isocrates
the
fair
what
message
will
you
send
to
him
and
how
shall
we
describe
him
socrates
isocrates
is
still
young
phaedrus
but
i
am
willing
to
hazard
a
prophecy
concerning
him
phaedrus
what
would
you
prophesy
socrates
i
think
that
he
has
a
genius
which
soars
above
the
orations
of
lysias
and
that
his
character
is
cast
in
a
finer
mould
my
impression
of
him
is
that
he
will
marvellously
improve
as
he
grows
older
and
that
all
former
rhetoricians
will
be
as
children
in
comparison
of
him
and
i
believe
that
he
will
not
be
satisfied
with
rhetoric
but
that
there
is
in
him
a
divine
inspiration
which
will
lead
him
to
things
higher
still
for
he
has
an
element
of
philosophy
in
his
nature
this
is
the
message
of
the
gods
dwelling
in
this
place
and
which
i
will
myself
deliver
to
isocrates
who
is
my
delight
and
do
you
give
the
other
to
lysias
who
is
yours
phaedrus
i
will
and
now
as
the
heat
is
abated
let
us
depart
socrates
should
we
not
offer
up
a
prayer
first
of
all
to
the
local
deities
phaedrus
by
all
means
socrates
beloved
pan
and
all
ye
other
gods
who
haunt
this
place
give
me
beauty
in
the
inward
soul
and
may
the
outward
and
inward
man
be
at
one
may
i
reckon
the
wise
to
be
the
wealthy
and
may
i
have
such
a
quantity
of
gold
as
a
temperate
man
and
he
only
can
bear
and
anything
more
the
prayer
i
think
is
enough
for
me
phaedrus
ask
the
same
for
me
for
friends
should
have
all
things
in
common
socrates
let
us
go
