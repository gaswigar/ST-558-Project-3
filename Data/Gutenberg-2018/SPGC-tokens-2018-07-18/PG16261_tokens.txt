think
that
my
best
apology
for
the
insignificant
size
of
this
volume
is
the
very
character
of
the
material
composing
it
in
preparing
the
legends
i
sought
especially
for
and
i
could
not
forget
this
striking
observation
in
sir
walter
scott
essay
on
imitations
of
the
ancient
ballad
the
supernatural
though
appealing
to
certain
powerful
emotions
very
widely
and
deeply
sown
amongst
the
human
race
is
nevertheless
a
which
is
peculiarly
apt
to
lose
its
elasticity
by
being
too
much
pressed
those
desirous
to
familiarize
themselves
with
chinese
literature
as
a
whole
have
had
the
way
made
smooth
for
them
by
the
labors
of
linguists
like
julien

the

the
humbler
traveller
who
follows
wonderingly
after
them
into
the
vast
and
mysterious
of
chinese
fancy
may
surely
be
permitted

at

the
sudden
sibilant
sobbing
in

immense
tone
faints
away
in
broken
whispers
of
silver
as
though
a
woman
should
whisper
even
so
the
great
bell
hath
sounded
every
day
for
five
hundred
years
first
with
stupendous
clang
then
with
immeasurable
moan
of
gold
then
with
silver
murmuring
of
and
there
is
not
a
child
in
all
the
ways
of
the
old
chinese
city
who
does
not
know
the
story
of
the
great
bell
who
can
not
tell
you
why
the
great
bell
says
and
now
this
is
the
story
of
the
great
bell
in
the
sz
as
the
same
is
related
in
the
written
by
the
learned
of
the
city
of
nearly
five
hundred
years
ago
the
celestially
august
the
son
of
heaven
of
the
illustrious
or
ming
dynasty
commanded
the
worthy
official
that
he
should
have
a
bell
made
of
such
size
that
the
sound
thereof
might
be
heard
for
one
hundred
and
he
further
ordained
that
the
voice
of
the
bell
should
be
strengthened
with
brass
and
deepened
with
gold
and
sweetened
with
silver
and
that
the
face
and
the
great
lips
of
it
should
be
graven
with
blessed
sayings
from
the
sacred
books
and
that
it
should
be
suspended
in
the
centre
of
the
imperial
capital
to
sound
through
all
the
ways
of
the
city
of
therefore
the
worthy
mandarin
assembled
the
and
the
renowned
bellsmiths
of
the
empire
and
all
men
of
great
repute
and
cunning
in
foundry
work
and
they
measured
the
materials
for
the
alloy
and
treated
them
skilfully
and
prepared
the
moulds
the
fires
the
instruments
and
the
monstrous
for
fusing
the
metal
and
they
labored
exceedingly
like
giants
neglecting
only
rest
and
sleep
and
the
comforts
of
life
toiling
both
night
and
day
in
obedience
to
and
striving
in
all
things
to
do
the
behest
of
the
son
of
heaven
but
when
the
metal
had
been
cast
and
the
earthen
mould
separated
from
the
glowing
casting
it
was
discovered
that
despite
their
great
labor
and
ceaseless
care
the
result
was
void
of
worth
for
the
metals
had
rebelled
one
against
the
other
the
gold
had
scorned
alliance
with
the
brass
the
silver
would
not
mingle
with
the
molten
iron
therefore
the
moulds
had
to
be
once
more
prepared
and
the
fires
rekindled
and
the
metal
remelted
and
all
the
work
tediously
and
toilsomely
repeated
the
son
of
heaven
heard
and
was
angry
but
spake
nothing
a
second
time
the
bell
was
cast
and
the
result
was
even
worse
still
the
metals
obstinately
refused
to
blend
one
with
the
other
and
there
was
no
uniformity
in
the
bell
and
the
sides
of
it
were
cracked
and
fissured
and
the
lips
of
it
were
slagged
and
split
asunder
so
that
all
the
labor
had
to
be
repeated
even
a
third
time
to
the
great
dismay
of
and
when
the
son
of
heaven
heard
these
things
he
was
angrier
than
before
and
sent
his
messenger
to
with
a
letter
written
upon
silk
and
sealed
with
the
seal
of
the
dragon
containing
these
words
the
mighty
the
sublime
the
celestial
and
august
whose
reign
is
called
to
the
twice
thou
hast
betrayed
the
trust
we
have
deigned
graciously
to
place
in
thee
if
thou
fail
a
third
time
in
fulfilling
our
command
thy
head
shall
be
severed
from
thy
neck
tremble
and
obey
now
had
a
daughter
of
dazzling
loveliness
whose
name
was
ever
in
the
mouths
of
poets
and
whose
heart
was
even
more
beautiful
than
her
face
loved
her
father
with
such
love
that
she
had
refused
a
hundred
worthy
suitors
rather
than
make
his
home
desolate
by
her
absence
and
when
she
had
seen
the
awful
yellow
missive
sealed
with
the
she
fainted
away
with
fear
for
her
sake
and
when
her
senses
and
her
strength
returned
to
her
she
could
not
rest
or
sleep
for
thinking
of
her
parent
danger
until
she
had
secretly
sold
some
of
her
jewels
and
with
the
money
so
obtained
had
hastened
to
an
astrologer
and
paid
him
a
great
price
to
advise
her
by
what
means
her
father
might
be
saved
from
the
peril
impending
over
him
so
the
astrologer
made
observations
of
the
heavens
and
marked
the
aspect
of
the
silver
stream
which
we
call
the
milky
way
and
examined
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
the
or
yellow
road
and
consulted
the
table
of
the
five
or
principles
of
the
universe
and
the
mystical
books
of
the
alchemists
and
after
a
long
silence
he
made
answer
to
her
saying
gold
and
brass
will
never
meet
in
wedlock
silver
and
iron
never
will
embrace
until
the
flesh
of
a
maiden
be
melted
in
the
crucible
until
the
blood
of
a
virgin
be
mixed
with
the
metals
in
their
fusion
so
returned
home
sorrowful
at
heart
but
she
kept
secret
all
that
she
had
heard
and
told
no
one
what
she
had
done
at
last
came
the
awful
day
when
the
third
and
last
effort
to
cast
the
great
bell
was
to
be
made
and
together
with
her
accompanied
her
father
to
the
foundry
and
they
took
their
places
upon
a
platform
overlooking
the
toiling
of
the
moulders
and
the
lava
of
liquefied
metal
all
the
workmen
wrought
their
tasks
in
silence
there
was
no
sound
heard
but
the
muttering
of
the
fires
and
the
muttering
deepened
into
a
roar
like
the
roar
of
typhoons
approaching
and
the
lake
of
metal
slowly
brightened
like
the
vermilion
of
a
sunrise
and
the
vermilion
was
transmuted
into
a
radiant
glow
of
gold
and
the
gold
whitened
blindingly
like
the
silver
face
of
a
full
moon
then
the
workers
ceased
to
feed
the
raving
flame
and
all
fixed
their
eyes
upon
the
eyes
of
and
prepared
to
give
the
signal
to
cast
but
ere
ever
he
lifted
his
finger
a
cry
caused
him
to
turn
his
head
and
all
heard
the
voice
of
sounding
sharply
sweet
as
a
song
above
the
great
thunder
of
the
fires
thy
sake
o
my
father
and
even
as
she
cried
she
leaped
into
the
white
flood
of
metal
and
the
lava
of
the
furnace
roared
to
receive
her
and
spattered
monstrous
flakes
of
flame
to
the
roof
and
burst
over
the
verge
of
the
earthen
crater
and
cast
up
a
whirling
fountain
of
fires
and
subsided
quakingly
with
lightnings
and
with
thunders
and
with
mutterings
then
the
father
of
wild
with
his
grief
would
have
leaped
in
after
her
but
that
strong
men
held
him
back
and
kept
firm
grasp
upon
him
until
he
had
fainted
away
and
they
could
bear
him
like
one
dead
to
his
home
and
the
of
dizzy
and
speechless
for
pain
stood
before
the
furnace
still
holding
in
her
hands
a
shoe
a
tiny
dainty
shoe
with
embroidery
of
pearls
and
flowers
the
shoe
of
her
beautiful
mistress
that
was
for
she
had
sought
to
grasp
by
the
foot
as
she
leaped
but
had
only
been
able
to
clutch
the
shoe
and
the
pretty
shoe
came
off
in
her
hand
and
she
continued
to
stare
at
it
like
one
gone
mad
but
in
spite
of
all
these
things
the
command
of
the
celestial
and
august
had
to
be
obeyed
and
the
work
of
the
moulders
to
be
finished
hopeless
as
the
result
might
be
yet
the
glow
of
the
metal
seemed
purer
and
whiter
than
before
and
there
was
no
sign
of
the
beautiful
body
that
had
been
entombed
therein
so
the
ponderous
casting
was
made
and
lo
when
the
metal
had
become
cool
it
was
found
that
the
bell
was
beautiful
to
look
upon
and
perfect
in
form
and
wonderful
in
color
above
all
other
bells
nor
was
there
any
trace
found
of
the
body
of
for
it
had
been
totally
absorbed
by
the
precious
alloy
and
blended
with
the
brass
and
gold
with
the
intermingling
of
the
silver
and
the
iron
and
when
they
sounded
the
bell
its
tones
were
found
to
be
deeper
and
mellower
and
mightier
than
the
tones
of
any
other
bell
reaching
even
beyond
the
distance
of
one
hundred
like
a
pealing
of
summer
thunder
and
yet
also
like
some
vast
voice
uttering
a
name
a
woman
name
the
name
of
and
still
between
each
mighty
stroke
there
is
a
long
low
moaning
heard
and
ever
the
moaning
ends
with
a
sound
of
sobbing
and
of
complaining
as
though
a
weeping
woman
should
murmur
and
still
when
the
people
hear
that
great
golden
moan
they
keep
silence
but
when
the
sharp
sweet
shuddering
comes
in
the
air
and
the
sobbing
of
then
indeed
all
the
chinese
mothers
in
all
the
ways
of
whisper
to
their
little
ones
that

crying

who

listening
crowds

concerning
her
you
may
also
find
in
the
book
entitled
which
signifies
in
our
tongue
the
marvellous
happenings
of
ancient
and
of
recent
times
and
perhaps
of
all
things
therein
written
the
most
marvellous
is
this
memory
of
five
hundred
years
ago
in
the
reign
of
the
emperor
whose
dynasty
was
there
lived
in
the
city
of
genii
the
city
of
a
man
celebrated
for
his
learning
and
for
his
piety
named
this
had
one
son
a
beautiful
boy
who
for
scholarship
and
for
bodily
grace
and
for
polite
accomplishments
had
no
superior
among
the
youths
of
his
age
and
his
name
was
now
when
the
lad
was
in
his
eighteenth
summer
it
came
to
pass
that
pelou
his
father
was
appointed
inspector
of
public
instruction
at
the
city
of
and
accompanied
his
parents
thither
near
the
city
of
lived
a
rich
man
of
rank
a
high
commissioner
of
the
government
whose
name
was
tchang
and
who
wanted
to
find
a
worthy
teacher
for
his
children
on
hearing
of
the
arrival
of
the
new
inspector
of
public
instruction
the
noble
tchang
visited
him
to
obtain
advice
in
this
matter
and
happening
to
meet
and
converse
with
accomplished
son
immediately
engaged
as
a
private
tutor
for
his
family
now
as
the
house
of
this
lord
tchang
was
situated
several
miles
from
town
it
was
deemed
best
that
should
abide
in
the
house
of
his
employer
accordingly
the
youth
made
ready
all
things
necessary
for
his
new
sojourn
and
his
parents
bidding
him
farewell
counselled
him
wisely
and
cited
to
him
the
words
of
and
of
the
ancient
sages
a
beautiful
face
the
world
is
filled
with
love
but
heaven
may
never
be
deceived
thereby
shouldst
thou
behold
a
woman
coming
from
the
east
look
thou
to
the
west
shouldst
thou
perceive
a
maiden
approaching
from
the
west
turn
thine
eyes
to
the
if
did
not
heed
this
counsel
in
after
days
it
was
only
because
of
his
youth
and
the
thoughtlessness
of
a
naturally
joyous
heart
and
he
departed
to
abide
in
the
house
of
lord
tchang
while
the
autumn
passed
and
the
winter
also
when
the
time
of
the
second
moon
of
spring
was
drawing
near
and
that
happy
day
which
the
chinese
call
or
the
birthday
of
a
hundred
flowers
a
longing
came
upon
to
see
his
parents
and
he
opened
his
heart
to
the
good
tchang
who
not
only
gave
him
the
permission
he
desired
but
also
pressed
into
his
hand
a
silver
gift
of
two
ounces
thinking
that
the
lad
might
wish
to
bring
some
little
memento
to
his
father
and
mother
for
it
is
the
chinese
custom
on
the
feast
of
to
make
presents
to
friends
and
relations
that
day
all
the
air
was
drowsy
with
blossom
perfume
and
vibrant
with
the
droning
of
bees
it
seemed
to
that
the
path
he
followed
had
not
been
trodden
by
any
other
for
many
long
years
the
grass
was
tall
upon
it
vast
trees
on
either
side
interlocked
their
mighty
and
arms
above
him
beshadowing
the
way
but
the
leafy
obscurities
quivered
with
and
the
deep
vistas
of
the
wood
were
glorified
by
vapors
of
gold
and
odorous
with
as
a
temple
with
incense
the
dreamy
joy
of
the
day
entered
into
the
heart
of
and
he
sat
him
down
among
the
young
blossoms
under
the
branches
swaying
against
the
violet
sky
to
drink
in
the
perfume
and
the
light
and
to
enjoy
the
great
sweet
silence
even
while
thus
reposing
a
sound
caused
him
to
turn
his
eyes
toward
a
shady
place
where
wild
were
in
bloom
and
he
beheld
a
young
woman
beautiful
as
the
pinkening
blossoms
themselves
trying
to
hide
among
them
though
he
looked
for
a
moment
only
could
not
avoid
discerning
the
loveliness
of
her
face
the
golden
purity
of
her
complexion
and
the
brightness
of
her
long
eyes
that
sparkled
under
a
pair
of
brows
as
daintily
curved
as
the
wings
of
the
silkworm
butterfly
outspread
at
once
turned
his
gaze
away
and
rising
quickly
proceeded
on
his
journey
but
so
much
embarrassed
did
he
feel
at
the
idea
of
those
charming
eyes
peeping
at
him
through
the
leaves
that
he
suffered
the
money
he
had
been
carrying
in
his
sleeve
to
fall
without
being
aware
of
it
a
few
moments
later
he
heard
the
patter
of
light
feet
running
behind
him
and
a
woman
voice
calling
him
by
name
turning
his
face
in
great
surprise
he
saw
a
comely
who
said
to
him
sir
my
mistress
bade
me
pick
up
and
return
you
this
silver
which
you
dropped
upon
the
road
thanked
the
girl
gracefully
and
requested
her
to
convey
his
compliments
to
her
mistress
then
he
proceeded
on
his
way
through
the
perfumed
silence
athwart
the
shadows
that
dreamed
along
the
forgotten
path
dreaming
himself
also
and
feeling
his
heart
beating
with
strange
quickness
at
the
thought
of
the
beautiful
being
that
he
had
seen
it
was
just
such
another
day
when
returning
by
the
same
path
paused
once
more
at
the
spot
where
the
gracious
figure
had
momentarily
appeared
before
him
but
this
time
he
was
surprised
to
perceive
through
a
long
vista
of
immense
trees
a
dwelling
that
had
previously
escaped
his
notice
a
country
residence
not
large
yet
elegant
to
an
unusual
degree
the
bright
blue
tiles
of
its
curved
and
serrated
double
roof
rising
above
the
foliage
seemed
to
blend
their
color
with
the
luminous
azure
of
the
day
the
designs
of
its
carven
porticos
were
exquisite
artistic
mockeries
of
leaves
and
flowers
bathed
in
sunshine
and
at
the
summit
of
before
it
guarded
by
great
porcelain
tortoises
saw
standing
the
mistress
of
the
mansion
the
idol
of
his
passionate
fancy
accompanied
by
the
same
who
had
borne
to
her
his
message
of
gratitude
while
looked
he
perceived
that
their
eyes
were
upon
him
they
smiled
and
conversed
together
as
if
speaking
about
him
and
shy
though
he
was
the
youth
found
courage
to
salute
the
fair
one
from
a
distance
to
his
astonishment
the
young
servant
beckoned
him
to
approach
and
opening
a
rustic
gate
half
veiled
by
trailing
plants
bearing
crimson
flowers
advanced
along
the
verdant
alley
leading
to
the
terrace
with
mingled
feelings
of
surprise
and
timid
joy
as
he
drew
near
the
beautiful
lady
withdrew
from
sight
but
the
maid
waited
at
the
broad
steps
to
receive
him
and
said
as
he
ascended
sir
my
mistress
understands
you
wish
to
thank
her
for
the
trifling
service
she
recently
bade
me
do
you
and
requests
that
you
will
enter
the
house
as
she
knows
you
already
by
repute
and
desires
to
have
the
pleasure
of
bidding
you
entered
bashfully
his
feet
making
no
sound
upon
a
matting
elastically
soft
as
forest
moss
and
found
himself
in
a
vast
cool
and
fragrant
with
scent
of
blossoms
freshly
gathered
a
delicious
quiet
pervaded
the
mansion
shadows
of
flying
birds
passed
over
the
bands
of
light
that
fell
through
the
of
bamboo
great
butterflies
with
pinions
of
fiery
color
found
their
way
in
to
hover
a
moment
about
the
painted
vases
and
pass
out
again
into
the
mysterious
woods
and
noiselessly
as
they
the
young
mistress
of
the
mansion
entered
by
another
door
and
kindly
greeted
the
boy
who
lifted
his
hands
to
his
breast
and
bowed
low
in
salutation
she
was
taller
than
he
had
deemed
her
and
as
a
beauteous
lily
her
black
hair
was
interwoven
with
the
creamy
blossoms
of
the
her
robes
of
pale
silk
took
shifting
tints
when
she
moved
as
vapors
change
hue
with
the
changing
of
the
light
if
i
be
not
mistaken
she
said
when
both
had
seated
themselves
after
having
exchanged
the
customary
formalities
of
politeness
my
honored
visitor
is
none
other
than
surnamed
educator
of
the
children
of
my
respected
relative
the
high
commissioner
tchang
as
the
family
of
lord
tchang
is
my
family
also
i
can
not
but
consider
the
teacher
of
his
children
as
one
of
my
own
kin
lady
replied
not
a
little
astonished
may
i
dare
to
inquire
the
name
of
your
honored
family
and
to
ask
the
relation
which
you
hold
to
my
noble
patron
the
name
of
my
poor
family
responded
the
comely
lady
is
an
ancient
family
of
the
city
of
i
am
the
daughter
of
a
certain
si√´
of
si√´
is
my
name
likewise
and
i
was
married
to
a
young
man
of
the
ping
family
whose
name
was
khang
by
this
marriage
i
became
related
to
your
excellent
patron
but
my
husband
died
soon
after
our
wedding
and
i
have
chosen
this
solitary
place
to
reside
in
during
the
period
of
my
widowhood
there
was
a
drowsy
music
in
her
voice
as
of
the
melody
of
brooks
the
murmurings
of
spring
and
such
a
strange
grace
in
the
manner
of
her
speech
as
had
never
heard
before
yet
on
learning
that
she
was
a
widow
the
youth
would
not
have
presumed
to
remain
long
in
her
presence
without
a
formal
invitation
and
after
having
sipped
the
cup
of
rich
tea
presented
to
him
he
arose
to
depart
si√´
would
not
suffer
him
to
go
so
quickly
nay
friend
she
said
stay
yet
a
little
while
in
my
house
i
pray
you
for
should
your
honored
patron
ever
learn
that
you
had
been
here
and
that
i
had
not
treated
you
as
a
respected
guest
and
regaled
you
even
as
i
would
him
i
know
that
he
would
be
greatly
angered
remain
at
least
to
supper
so
remained
rejoicing
secretly
in
his
heart
for
si√´
seemed
to
him
the
fairest
and
sweetest
being
he
had
ever
known
and
he
felt
that
he
loved
her
even
more
than
his
father
and
his
mother
and
while
they
talked
the
long
shadows
of
the
evening
slowly
blended
into
one
violet
darkness
the
great
of
the
sunset
faded
out
and
those
starry
beings
that
are
called
the
three
councillors
who
preside
over
life
and
death
and
the
destinies
of
men
opened
their
cold
bright
eyes
in
the
northern
sky
within
the
mansion
of
si√´
the
painted
lanterns
were
lighted
the
table
was
laid
for
the
evening
repast
and
took
his
place
at
it
feeling
little
inclination
to
eat
and
thinking
only
of
the
charming
face
before
him
observing
that
he
scarcely
tasted
the
dainties
laid
upon
his
plate
si√´
pressed
her
young
guest
to
partake
of
wine
and
they
drank
several
cups
together
it
was
a
purple
wine
so
cool
that
the
cup
into
which
it
was
poured
became
covered
with
vapory
dew
yet
it
seemed
to
warm
the
veins
with
strange
fire
to
as
he
drank
all
things
became
more
luminous
as
by
enchantment
the
walls
of
the
chamber
appeared
to
recede
and
the
roof
to
heighten
the
lamps
glowed
like
stars
in
their
chains
and
the
voice
of
si√´
floated
to
the
boy
ears
like
some
far
melody
heard
through
the
spaces
of
a
drowsy
night
his
heart
swelled
his
tongue
loosened
and
words
flitted
from
his
lips
that
he
had
fancied
he
could
never
dare
to
utter
yet
si√´
sought
not
to
restrain
him
her
lips
gave
no
smile
but
her
long
bright
eyes
seemed
to
laugh
with
pleasure
at
his
words
of
praise
and
to
return
his
gaze
of
passionate
admiration
with
affectionate
interest
i
have
heard
she
said
of
your
rare
talent
and
of
your
many
elegant
accomplishments
i
know
how
to
sing
a
little
although
i
can
not
claim
to
possess
any
musical
learning
and
now
that
i
have
the
honor
of
finding
myself
in
the
society
of
a
musical
professor
i
will
venture
to
lay
modesty
aside
and
beg
you
to
sing
a
few
songs
with
me
i
should
deem
it
no
small
gratification
if
you
would
condescend
to
examine
my
musical
compositions
the
honor
and
the
gratification
dear
lady
replied
will
be
mine
and
i
feel
helpless
to
express
the
gratitude
which
the
offer
of
so
rare
a
favor
deserves
the
obedient
to
the
summons
of
a
little
silver
gong
brought
in
the
music
and
retired
took
the
manuscripts
and
began
to
examine
them
with
eager
delight
the
paper
upon
which
they
were
written
had
a
pale
yellow
tint
and
was
light
as
a
fabric
of
gossamer
but
the
characters
were
antiquely
beautiful
as
though
they
had
been
traced
by
the
brush
of
himself
that
divine
genius
of
ink
who
is
no
bigger
than
a
fly
and
the
signatures
attached
to
the
compositions
were
the
signatures
of
and
mighty
poets
and
musicians
of
the
dynasty
of
thang
could
not
repress
a
scream
of
delight
at
the
sight
of
treasures
so
inestimable
and
so
unique
scarcely
could
he
summon
resolution
enough
to
permit
them
to
leave
his
hands
even
for
a
moment
o
lady
he
cried
these
are
veritably
priceless
things
surpassing
in
worth
the
treasures
of
all
kings
this
indeed
is
the
handwriting
of
those
great
masters
who
sang
five
hundred
years
before
our
birth
how
marvellously
it
has
been
preserved
is
not
this
the
wondrous
ink
of
which
it
was
written
centuries
i
remain
firm
as
stone
and
the
letters
that
i
make
like
lacquer
and
how
divine
the
charm
of
this
composition
the
song
of
prince
of
poets
and
governor
of
five
hundred
years
ago
darling
murmured
si√´
with
a
singular
light
in
her
eyes
is
also
my
favorite
dear
let
us
chant
his
verses
together
to
the
melody
of
old
the
music
of
those
grand
years
when
men
were
nobler
and
wiser
than
and
their
voices
rose
through
the
perfumed
night
like
the
voices
of
the
of
the
blending
together
in
liquid
sweetness
yet
a
moment
and
overcome
by
the
witchery
of
his
companion
voice
could
only
listen
in
speechless
ecstasy
while
the
lights
of
the
chamber
swam
dim
before
his
sight
and
tears
of
pleasure
trickled
down
his
cheeks
so
the
ninth
hour
passed
and
they
continued
to
converse
and
to
drink
the
cool
purple
wine
and
to
sing
the
songs
of
the
years
of
thang
until
far
into
the
night
more
than
once
thought
of
departing
but
each
time
si√´
would
begin
in
that
voice
of
hers
so
wondrous
a
story
of
the
great
poets
of
the
past
and
of
the
women
whom
they
loved
that
he
became
as
one
entranced
or
she
would
sing
for
him
a
song
so
strange
that
all
his
senses
seemed
to
die
except
that
of
hearing
and
at
last
as
she
paused
to
pledge
him
in
a
cup
of
wine
could
not
restrain
himself
from
putting
his
arm
about
her
round
neck
and
drawing
her
dainty
head
closer
to
him
and
kissing
the
lips
that
were
so
much
ruddier
and
sweeter
than
the
wine
then
their
lips
separated
no
more
the
night
grew
old
and
they
knew
it
not
the
birds
awakened
the
flowers
opened
their
eyes
to
the
rising
sun
and
found
himself
at
last
compelled
to
bid
his
lovely
enchantress
farewell
si√´
accompanying
him
to
the
terrace
kissed
him
fondly
and
said
dear
boy
come
hither
as
often
as
you
are
able
as
often
as
your
heart
whispers
you
to
come
i
know
that
you
are
not
of
those
without
faith
and
truth
who
betray
secrets
yet
being
so
young
you
might
also
be
sometimes
thoughtless
and
i
pray
you
never
to
forget
that
only
the
stars
have
been
the
witnesses
of
our
love
speak
of
it
to
no
living
person
dearest
and
take
with
you
this
little
souvenir
of
our
happy
night
and
she
presented
him
with
an
exquisite
and
curious
little
thing
a
in
likeness
of
a
couchant
lion
wrought
from
a
yellow
as
that
created
by
a
rainbow
in
honor
of
tenderly
the
boy
kissed
the
gift
and
the
beautiful
hand
that
gave
it
may
the
spirits
punish
me
he
vowed
if
ever
i
knowingly
give
you
cause
to
reproach
me
sweetheart
and
they
separated
with
mutual
vows
that
morning
on
returning
to
the
house
of
lord
tchang
told
the
first
falsehood
which
had
ever
passed
his
lips
he
averred
that
his
mother
had
requested
him
thenceforward
to
pass
his
nights
at
home
now
that
the
weather
had
become
so
pleasant
for
though
the
way
was
somewhat
long
he
was
strong
and
active
and
needed
both
air
and
healthy
exercise
tchang
believed
all
said
and
offered
no
objection
accordingly
the
lad
found
himself
enabled
to
pass
all
his
evenings
at
the
house
of
the
beautiful
si√´
each
night
they
devoted
to
the
same
pleasures
which
had
made
their
first
acquaintance
so
charming
they
sang
and
conversed
by
turns
they
played
at
chess
the
learned
game
invented
by
which
is
an
imitation
of
war
they
composed
pieces
of
eighty
rhymes
upon
the
flowers
the
trees
the
clouds
the
streams
the
birds
the
bees
but
in
all
accomplishments
si√´
far
excelled
her
young
sweetheart
whenever
they
played
at
chess
it
was
always
general
who
was
surrounded
and
vanquished
when
they
composed
verses
si√´
poems
were
ever
superior
to
his
in
harmony
of
in
elegance
of
form
in
classic
loftiness
of
thought
and
the
themes
they
selected
were
always
the
most
difficult
those
of
the
poets
of
the
thang
dynasty
the
songs
they
sang
were
also
the
songs
of
five
hundred
years
before
the
songs
of
of
of
above
all
high
poet
and
ruler
of
the
province
of
so
the
summer
waxed
and
waned
upon
their
love
and
the
luminous
autumn
came
with
its
vapors
of
phantom
gold
its
shadows
of
magical
purple
then
it
unexpectedly
happened
that
the
father
of
meeting
his
son
employer
at
was
asked
by
him
why
must
your
boy
continue
to
travel
every
evening
to
the
city
now
that
the
winter
is
approaching
the
way
is
long
and
when
he
returns
in
the
morning
he
looks
fordone
with
weariness
why
not
permit
him
to
slumber
in
my
house
during
the
season
of
snow
and
the
father
of
greatly
astonished
responded
sir
my
son
has
not
visited
the
city
nor
has
he
been
to
our
house
all
this
summer
i
fear
that
he
must
have
acquired
wicked
habits
and
that
he
passes
his
nights
in
evil
company
perhaps
in
gaming
or
in
drinking
with
the
women
of
the
but
the
high
commissioner
returned
nay
that
is
not
to
be
thought
of
i
have
never
found
any
evil
in
the
boy
and
there
are
no
taverns
nor
nor
any
places
of
dissipation
in
our
neighborhood
no
doubt
has
found
some
amiable
youth
of
his
own
age
with
whom
to
spend
his
evenings
and
only
told
me
an
untruth
for
fear
that
i
would
not
otherwise
permit
him
to
leave
my
residence
i
beg
that
you
will
say
nothing
to
him
until
i
shall
have
sought
to
discover
this
mystery
and
this
very
evening
i
shall
send
my
servant
to
follow
after
him
and
to
watch
whither
he
goes
pelou
readily
assented
to
this
proposal
and
promising
to
visit
tchang
the
following
morning
returned
to
his
home
in
the
evening
when
left
the
house
of
tchang
a
servant
followed
him
unobserved
at
a
distance
but
on
reaching
the
most
obscure
portion
of
the
road
the
boy
disappeared
from
sight
as
suddenly
as
though
the
earth
had
swallowed
him
after
having
long
sought
after
him
in
vain
the
domestic
returned
in
great
bewilderment
to
the
house
and
related
what
had
taken
place
tchang
immediately
sent
a
messenger
to
pelou
in
the
mean
time
entering
the
chamber
of
his
beloved
was
surprised
and
deeply
pained
to
find
her
in
tears
sweetheart
she
sobbed
wreathing
her
arms
around
his
neck
we
are
about
to
be
separated
forever
because
of
reasons
which
i
can
not
tell
you
from
the
very
first
i
knew
this
must
come
to
pass
and
nevertheless
it
seemed
to
me
for
the
moment
so
cruelly
sudden
a
loss
so
unexpected
a
misfortune
that
i
could
not
prevent
myself
from
weeping
after
this
night
we
shall
never
see
each
other
again
beloved
and
i
know
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
forget
me
while
you
live
but
i
know
also
that
you
will
become
a
great
scholar
and
that
honors
and
riches
will
be
showered
upon
you
and
that
some
beautiful
and
loving
woman
will
console
you
for
my
loss
and
now
let
us
speak
no
more
of
grief
but
let
us
pass
this
last
evening
joyously
so
that
your
recollection
of
me
may
not
be
a
painful
one
and
that
you
may
remember
my
laughter
rather
than
my
tears
she
brushed
the
bright
drops
away
and
brought
wine
and
music
and
the
melodious
of
seven
silken
strings
and
would
not
suffer
to
speak
for
one
moment
of
the
coming
separation
and
she
sang
him
an
ancient
song
about
the
calmness
of
summer
lakes
reflecting
the
blue
of
heaven
only
and
the
calmness
of
the
heart
also
before
the
clouds
of
care
and
of
grief
and
of
weariness
darken
its
little
world
soon
they
forgot
their
sorrow
in
the
joy
of
song
and
wine
and
those
last
hours
seemed
to
more
celestial
than
even
the
hours
of
their
first
bliss
but
when
the
yellow
beauty
of
morning
came
their
sadness
returned
and
they
wept
once
more
si√´
accompanied
her
lover
to
the
and
as
she
kissed
him
farewell
she
pressed
into
his
hand
a
parting
gift
a
little
of
agate
wonderfully
chiselled
and
worthy
the
table
of
a
great
poet
and
they
separated
forever
shedding
many
tears
still
could
not
believe
it
was
an
eternal
parting
no
he
thought
i
shall
visit
her
tomorrow
for
i
can
not
now
live
without
her
and
i
feel
assured
that
she
can
not
refuse
to
receive
me
such
were
the
thoughts
that
filled
his
mind
as
he
reached
the
house
of
tchang
to
find
his
father
and
his
patron
standing
on
the
porch
awaiting
him
ere
he
could
speak
a
word
pelou
demanded
son
in
what
place
have
you
been
passing
your
nights
seeing
that
his
falsehood
had
been
discovered
dared
not
make
any
reply
and
remained
abashed
and
silent
with
bowed
head
in
the
presence
of
his
father
then
pelou
striking
the
boy
violently
with
his
staff
commanded
him
to
divulge
the
secret
and
at
last
partly
through
fear
of
his
parent
and
partly
through
fear
of
the
law
which
ordains
that
son
refusing
to
obey
his
father
shall
be
punished
with
one
hundred
blows
of
the
bamboo
faltered
out
the
history
of
his
love
tchang
changed
color
at
the
boy
tale
child
exclaimed
the
high
commissioner
i
have
no
relative
of
the
name
of
ping
i
have
never
heard
of
the
woman
you
describe
i
have
never
heard
even
of
the
house
which
you
speak
of
but
i
know
also
that
you
can
not
dare
to
lie
to
pelou
your
honored
father
there
is
some
strange
delusion
in
all
this
affair
then
produced
the
gifts
that
si√´
had
given
him
the
lion
of
yellow
jade
the
of
carven
agate
also
some
original
compositions
made
by
the
beautiful
lady
herself
the
astonishment
of
tchang
was
now
shared
by
pelou
both
observed
that
the
of
agate
and
the
lion
of
jade
bore
the
appearance
of
objects
that
had
lain
buried
in
the
earth
for
centuries
and
were
of
a
workmanship
beyond
the
power
of
living
man
to
imitate
while
the
compositions
proved
to
be
veritable
of
poetry
written
in
the
style
of
the
poets
of
the
dynasty
of
thang
friend
pelou
cried
the
high
commissioner
let
us
immediately
accompany
the
boy
to
the
place
where
he
obtained
these
miraculous
things
and
apply
the
testimony
of
our
senses
to
this
mystery
the
boy
is
no
doubt
telling
the
truth
yet
his
story
passes
my
understanding
and
all
three
proceeded
toward
the
place
of
the
habitation
of
si√´
but
when
they
had
arrived
at
the
shadiest
part
of
the
road
where
the
perfumes
were
most
sweet
and
the
mosses
were
greenest
and
the
fruits
of
the
wild
peach
flushed
most
pinkly
gazing
through
the
groves
uttered
a
cry
of
dismay
where
the
roof
had
risen
against
the
sky
there
was
now
only
the
blue
emptiness
of
air
where
the
facade
had
been
there
was
visible
only
the
flickering
of
leaves
under
the
aureate
autumn
light
and
where
the
broad
terrace
had
extended
could
be
discerned
only
a
ruin
a
tomb
so
ancient
so
deeply
gnawed
by
moss
that
the
name
graven
upon
it
was
no
longer
decipherable
the
home
of
si√´
had
disappeared
all
suddenly
the
high
commissioner
smote
his
forehead
with
his
hand
and
turning
to
pelou
recited
the
verse
of
the
ancient
poet
the
blossom
over
the
tomb
of
friend
pelou
continued
tchang
the
beauty
who
bewitched
your
son
was
no
other
than
she
whose
tomb
stands
there
in
ruin
before
us
did
she
not
say
she
was
wedded
to
there
is
no
family
of
that
name
but
is
indeed
the
name
of
a
broad
alley
in
the
city
near
there
was
a
dark
riddle
in
all
that
she
said
she
called
herself
si√´
of
there
is
no
person
of
that
name
there
is
no
street
of
that
name
but
the
chinese
characters
and
placed
together
form
the
character
listen
the
alley
situated
in
the
street
kiao
was
the
place
where
dwelt
the
great
courtesans
of
the
dynasty
of
thang
did
she
not
sing
the
songs
of
and
upon
the
and
the
she
gave
your
son
are
there
not
characters

read
object
of
art
belonging
to
kao
of
the
city
of
that
city
no
longer
exists
but
the
memory
of
remains
for
he
was
governor
of
the
province
of
and
a
mighty
poet
and
when
he
dwelt
in
the
land
of
chou
was
not
his
favorite
the
beautiful
wanton
si√´
unmatched
for
grace
among
all
the
women
of
her
day
it
was
he
who
made
her
a
gift
of
those
manuscripts
of
song
it
was
he
who
gave
her
those
objects
of
rare
art
died
not
as

her
limbs
may

crumbled
to

yet
something
of

still

in
this
deep
wood
her
shadow
still
haunts
this
shadowy
place
tchang
ceased
to
speak
a
vague
fear
fell
upon
the
three
the
thin
mists
of
the
morning
made
dim
the
distances
of
green
and
deepened
the
ghostly
beauty
of
the
woods
a
faint
breeze
passed
by
leaving
a
trail
of
a
last
odor
of
dying
flowers
thin
as
that
which
clings
to
the
silk
of
a
forgotten
robe
and
as
it
passed
the
trees
seemed
to
whisper
across
the
silence
fearing
greatly
for
his
son
pelou
sent
the
lad
away
at
once
to
the
city
of
and
there
in
after
years
obtained
high
dignities
and
honors
by
reason
of
his
talents
and
his
learning
and
he
married
the
daughter
of
an
illustrious
house
by
whom
he
became
the
father
of
sons
and
daughters
famous
for
their
virtues
and
their
accomplishments
never
could
he
forget
and
yet
it
is
said
that
he
never
spoke
of
her
not
even
when
his
children
begged
him
to
tell
them
the

old

name
of

has

for

so

the

no

of
any
city
nor
of
any
province
although
even
in
the
relation
of
the
most
ancient
traditions
such
an
omission
is
rare
we
are
only
told
that
the
name
of
the
hero
of
the
legend
was
and
that
he
lived
in
the
years
of
the
great
dynasty
of
han
some
twenty
centuries
ago
mother
had
died
while
he
was
yet
an
infant
and
when
he
became
a
youth
of
nineteen
years
his
father
also
passed
away
leaving
him
utterly
alone
in
the
world
and
without
resources
of
any
sort
for
being
a
very
poor
man
tong
father
had
put
himself
to
great
straits
to
educate
the
lad
and
had
not
been
able
to
lay
by
even
one
copper
coin
of
his
earnings
and
tong
lamented
greatly
to
find
himself
so
destitute
that
he
could
not
honor
the
memory
of
that
good
father
by
having
the
customary
rites
of
burial
performed
and
a
carven
tomb
erected
upon
a
propitious
site
the
poor
only
are
friends
of
the
poor
and
among
all
those
whom
tong
knew
there
was
no
one
able
to
assist
him
in
defraying
the
expenses
of
the
funeral
in
one
way
only
could
the
youth
obtain
money
by
selling
himself
as
a
slave
to
some
rich
cultivator
and
this
he
at
last
decided
to
do
in
vain
his
friends
did
their
utmost
to
dissuade
him
and
to
no
purpose
did
they
attempt
to
delay
the
accomplishment
of
his
sacrifice
by
beguiling
promises
of
future
aid
tong
only
replied
that
he
would
sell
his
freedom
a
hundred
times
if
it
were
possible
rather
than
suffer
his
father
memory
to
remain
unhonored
even
for
a
brief
season
and
furthermore
confiding
in
his
youth
and
strength
he
determined
to
put
a
high
price
upon
his
servitude
a
price
which
would
enable
him
to
build
a
handsome
tomb
but
which
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
ever
to
repay
accordingly
he
repaired
to
the
broad
public
place
where
slaves
and
debtors
were
exposed
for
sale
and
seated
himself
upon
a
bench
of
stone
having
affixed
to
his
shoulders
a
placard
inscribed
with
the
terms
of
his
servitude
and
the
list
of
his
qualifications
as
a
laborer
many
who
read
the
characters
upon
the
placard
smiled
disdainfully
at
the
price
asked
and
passed
on
without
a
word
others
lingered
only
to
question
him
out
of
simple
curiosity
some
commended
him
with
hollow
praise
some
openly
mocked
his
unselfishness
and
laughed
at
his
childish
piety
thus
many
hours
wearily
passed
and
tong
had
almost
despaired
of
finding
a
master
when
there
rode
up
a
high
official
of
the
province
a
grave
and
handsome
man
lord
of
a
thousand
slaves
and
owner
of
vast
estates
reining
in
his
tartar
horse
the
official
halted
to
read
the
placard
and
to
consider
the
value
of
the
slave
he
did
not
smile
or
advise
or
ask
any
questions
but
having
observed
the
price
asked
and
the
fine
strong
limbs
of
the
youth
purchased
him
without
further
ado
merely
ordering
his
attendant
to
pay
the
sum
and
to
see
that
the
necessary
papers
were
made
out
thus
tong
found
himself
enabled
to
fulfil
the
wish
of
his
heart
and
to
have
a
monument
built
which
although
of
small
size
was
destined
to
delight
the
eyes
of
all
who
beheld
it
being
designed
by
cunning
artists
and
executed
by
skilful
sculptors
and
while
it
was
yet
designed
only
the
pious
rites
were
performed
the
silver
coin
was
placed
in
the
mouth
of
the
dead
the
white
lanterns
were
hung
at
the
door
the
holy
prayers
were
recited
and
paper
shapes
of
all
things
the
departed
might
need
in
the
land
of
the
genii
were
consumed
in
consecrated
fire
and
after
the
geomancers
and
the
necromancers
had
chosen
a
which
no
unlucky
star
could
shine
upon
a
place
of
rest
which
no
demon
or
dragon
might
ever
disturb
the
beautiful
was
built
then
was
the
phantom
money
strewn
along
the
way
the
funeral
procession
departed
from
the
dwelling
of
the
dead
and
with
prayers
and
lamentation
the
mortal
remains
of
tong
good
father
were
borne
to
the
tomb
then
tong
entered
as
a
slave
into
the
service
of
his
purchaser
who
allotted
him
a
little
hut
to
dwell
in
and
thither
tong
carried
with
him
those
wooden
tablets
bearing
the
ancestral
names
before
which
filial
piety
must
daily
burn
the
incense
of
prayer
and
perform
the
tender
duties
of
family
worship
thrice
had
spring
perfumed
the
breast
of
the
land
with
flowers
and
thrice
had
been
celebrated
that
festival
of
the
dead
which
is
called
and
thrice
had
tong
swept
and
garnished
his
father
tomb
and
presented
his
fivefold
offering
of
fruits
and
meats
the
period
of
mourning
had
passed
yet
he
had
not
ceased
to
mourn
for
his
parent
the
years
revolved
with
their
moons
bringing
him
no
hour
of
joy
no
day
of
happy
rest
yet
he
never
lamented
his
servitude
or
failed
to
perform
the
rites
of
ancestral
worship
until
at
last
the
fever
of
the
laid
strong
hold
upon
him
and
he
could
not
arise
from
his
couch
and
his
thought
him
destined
to
die
there
was
no
one
to
wait
upon
him
no
one
to
care
for
his
needs
inasmuch
as
slaves
and
servants
were
wholly
busied
with
the
duties
of
the
household
or
the
labor
of
the
fields
all
departing
to
toil
at
sunrise
and
returning
weary
only
after
the
sundown
now
while
the
sick
youth
slumbered
the
fitful
slumber
of
exhaustion
one
sultry
noon
he
dreamed
that
a
strange
and
beautiful
woman
stood
by
him
and
bent
above
him
and
touched
his
forehead
with
the
long
fine
fingers
of
her
shapely
hand
and
at
her
cool
touch
a
weird
sweet
shock
passed
through
him
and
all
his
veins
tingled
as
if
thrilled
by
new
life
opening
his
eyes
in
wonder
he
saw
verily
bending
over
him
the
charming
being
of
whom
he
had
dreamed
and
he
knew
that
her
lithe
hand
really
caressed
his
throbbing
forehead
but
the
flame
of
the
fever
was
gone
a
delicious
coolness
now
penetrated
every
fibre
of
his
body
and
the
thrill
of
which
he
had
dreamed
still
tingled
in
his
blood
like
a
great
joy
even
at
the
same
moment
the
eyes
of
the
gentle
visitor
met
his
own
and
he
saw
they
were
singularly
beautiful
and
shone
like
splendid
black
jewels
under
brows
curved
like
the
wings
of
the
swallow
yet
their
calm
gaze
seemed
to
pass
through
him
as
light
through
crystal
and
a
vague
awe
came
upon
him
so
that
the
question
which
had
risen
to
his
lips
found
no
utterance
then
she
still
caressing
him
smiled
and
said
i
have
come
to
restore
thy
strength
and
to
be
thy
wife
arise
and
worship
with
me
her
clear
voice
had
tones
melodious
as
a
bird
song
but
in
her
gaze
there
was
an
imperious
power
which
tong
felt
he
dare
not
resist
rising
from
his
couch
he
was
astounded
to
find
his
strength
wholly
restored
but
the
cool
slender
hand
which
held
his
own
led
him
away
so
swiftly
that
he
had
little
time
for
amazement
he
would
have
given
years
of
existence
for
courage
to
speak
of
his
misery
to
declare
his
utter
inability
to
maintain
a
wife
but
something
irresistible
in
the
long
dark
eyes
of
his
companion
forbade
him
to
speak
and
as
though
his
inmost
thought
had
been
discerned
by
that
wondrous
gaze
she
said
to
him
in
the
same
clear
voice
will
then
shame
made
him
blush
at
the
thought
of
his
wretched
aspect
and
tattered
apparel
but
he
observed
that
she
also
was
poorly
attired
like
a
woman
of
the
people
wearing
no
ornament
of
any
sort
nor
even
shoes
upon
her
feet
and
before
he
had
yet
spoken
to
her
they
came
before
the
ancestral
tablets
and
there
she
knelt
with
him
and
prayed
and
pledged
him
in
a
cup
of
wine
brought
he
knew
not
from
whence
and
together
they
worshipped
heaven
and
earth
thus
she
became
his
wife
a
mysterious
marriage
it
seemed
for
neither
on
that
day
nor
at
any
future
time
could
tong
venture
to
ask
his
wife
the
name
of
her
family
or
of
the
place
whence
she
came
and
he
could
not
answer
any
of
the
curious
questions
which
his
put
to
him
concerning
her
and
she
moreover
never
uttered
a
word
about
herself
except
to
say
that
her
name
was
tchi
but
although
tong
had
such
awe
of
her
that
while
her
eyes
were
upon
him
he
was
as
one
having
no
will
of
his
own
he
loved
her
unspeakably
and
the
thought
of
his
serfdom
ceased
to
weigh
upon
him
from
the
hour
of
his
marriage
as
through
magic
the
little
dwelling
had
become
transformed
its
misery
was
masked
with
charming
paper
devices
with
dainty
decorations
created
out
of
nothing
by
that
pretty
jugglery
of
which
woman
only
knows
the
secret
each
morning
at
dawn
the
young
husband
found
a
and
ample
repast
awaiting
him
and
each
evening
also
upon
his
return
but
the
wife
all
day
sat
at
her
loom
weaving
silk
after
a
fashion
unlike
anything
which
had
ever
been
seen
before
in
that
province
for
as
she
wove
the
silk
flowed
from
the
loom
like
a
slow
current
of
glossy
gold
bearing
upon
its
undulations
strange
forms
of
violet
and
crimson
and
shapes
of
ghostly
horsemen
riding
upon
horses
and
of
phantom
chariots
and
of
standards
of
trailing
cloud
in
every
dragon
beard
glimmered
the
mystic
pearl
in
every
rider
helmet
sparkled
the
gem
of
rank
and
each
day
tchi
would
weave
a
great
piece
of
such
figured
silk
and
the
fame
of
her
weaving
spread
abroad
from
far
and
near
people
thronged
to
see
the
marvellous
work
and
the
of
great
cities
heard
of
it
and
they
sent
messengers
to
tchi
asking
her
that
she
should
weave
for
them
and
teach
them
her
secret
then
she
wove
for
them
as
they
desired
in
return
for
the
silver
cubes
which
they
brought
her
but
when
they
prayed
her
to
teach
them
she
laughed
and
said
assuredly
i
could
never
teach
you
for
no
one
among
you
has
fingers
like
mine
and
indeed
no
man
could
discern
her
fingers
when
she
wove
any
more
than
he
might
behold
the
wings
of
a
bee
vibrating
in
swift
flight
the
seasons
passed
and
tong
never
knew
want
so
well
did
his
beautiful
wife
fulfil
her
promise
will
and
the
cubes
of
bright
silver
brought
by
the
were
piled
up
higher
and
higher
in
the
great
carven
chest
which
tchi
had
bought
for
the
storage
of
the
household
goods
one
morning
at
last
when
tong
having
finished
his
repast
was
about
to
depart
to
the
fields
tchi
unexpectedly
bade
him
remain
and
opening
the
great
chest
she
took
out
of
it
and
gave
him
a
document
written
in
the
official
characters
called
and
tong
looking
at
it
cried
out
and
leaped
in
his
joy
for
it
was
the
certificate
of
his
manumission
tchi
had
secretly
purchased
her
husband
freedom
with
the
price
of
her
wondrous
silks
thou
shalt
labor
no
more
for
any
master
she
said
but
for
thine
own
sake
only
and
i
have
also
bought
this
dwelling
with
all
which
is
therein
and
the
to
the
south
and
the
mulberry
groves
hard
by
all
of
which
are
thine
then
tong
beside
himself
for
gratefulness
would
have
prostrated
himself
in
worship
before
her
but
that
she
would
not
suffer
it
thus
he
was
made
free
and
prosperity
came
to
him
with
his
freedom
and
whatsoever
he
gave
to
the
sacred
earth
was
returned
to
him
centupled
and
his
servants
loved
him
and
blessed
the
beautiful
tchi
so
silent
and
yet
so
kindly
to
all
about
her
but
the
soon
remained
untouched
for
tchi
gave
birth
to
a
son
a
boy
so
beautiful
that
tong
wept
with
delight
when
he
looked
upon
him
and
thereafter
the
wife
devoted
herself
wholly
to
the
care
of
the
child
now
it
soon
became
manifest
that
the
boy
was
not
less
wonderful
than
his
wonderful
mother
in
the
third
month
of
his
age
he
could
speak
in
the
seventh
month
he
could
repeat
by
heart
the
proverbs
of
the
sages
and
recite
the
holy
prayers
before
the
eleventh
month
he
could
use
the
with
skill
and
copy
in
shapely
characters
the
precepts
of
and
the
priests
of
the
temples
came
to
behold
him
and
to
converse
with
him
and
they
marvelled
at
the
charm
of
the
child
and
the
wisdom
of
what
he
said
and
they
blessed
tong
saying
surely
this
son
of
thine
is
a
gift
from
the
master
of
heaven
a
sign
that
the
immortals
love
thee
may
thine
eyes
behold
a
hundred
happy
summers
it
was
in
the
period
of
the
eleventh
moon
the
flowers
had
passed
away
the
perfume
of
the
summer
had
flown
the
winds
were
growing
chill
and
in
tong
home
the
evening
fires
were
lighted
long
the
husband
and
wife
sat
in
the
mellow
glow
he
speaking
much
of
his
hopes
and
joys
and
of
his
son
that
was
to
be
so
grand
a
man
and
of
many
paternal
projects
while
she
speaking
little
listened
to
his
words
and
often
turned
her
wonderful
eyes
upon
him
with
an
answering
smile
never
had
she
seemed
so
beautiful
before
and
tong
watching
her
face
marked
not
how
the
night
waned
nor
how
the
fire
sank
low
nor
how
the
wind
sang
in
the
leafless
trees
without
all
suddenly
tchi
arose
without
speaking
and
took
his
hand
in
hers
and
led
him
gently
as
on
that
strange
to
the
cradle
where
their
boy
slumbered
faintly
smiling
in
his
dreams
and
in
that
moment
there
came
upon
tong
the
same
strange
fear
that
he
knew
when
tchi
eyes
had
first
met
his
own
the
vague
fear
that
love
and
trust
had
calmed
but
never
wholly
cast
out
like
unto
the
fear
of
the
gods
and
all
unknowingly
like
one
yielding
to
the
pressure
of
mighty
invisible
hands
he
bowed
himself
low
before
her
kneeling
as
to
a
divinity
now
when
he
lifted
his
eyes
again
to
her
face
he
closed
them
forthwith
in
awe
for
she
towered
before
him
taller
than
any
mortal
woman
and
there
was
a
glow
about
her
as
of
sunbeams
and
the
light
of
her
limbs
shone
through
her
garments
but
her
sweet
voice
came
to
him
with
all
the
tenderness
of
other
hours
saying
my
beloved
the
moment
has
come
in
which
i
must
forsake
thee
for
i
was
never
of
mortal
born
and
the
invisible
may
incarnate
themselves
for
a
time
only
yet
i
leave
with
thee
the
pledge
of
our
love
this
fair
son
who
shall
ever
be
to
thee
as
faithful
and
as
fond
as
thou
thyself
hast
been
know
my
beloved
that
i
was
sent
to
thee
even
by
the
master
of
heaven
in
reward
of
thy
filial
piety
and
that
i
must
now
return
to
the
glory
of
his
house
i
am
the
goddess
even
as
she
ceased
to
speak
the
great
glow
faded
and
tong
his
eyes
knew
that
she
had
passed
away
forever
mysteriously
as
pass
the
winds
of
heaven
irrevocably
as
the
light
of
a
flame
blown
out
yet
all
the
doors
were
barred
all
the
windows
unopened
still
the
child
slept
smiling
in
his
sleep
outside
the
darkness
was
breaking
the
sky
was
brightening
swiftly
the
night
was
past
with
splendid
majesty
the
east
threw
open
high
gates
of
gold
for
the
coming
of
the
sun
and
illuminated
by
the
glory
of
his
coming
the
vapors
of
morning
wrought
themselves
into
marvellous
shapes
of
shifting
color
into
forms
weirdly
beautiful
as
the
silken
dreams
woven
in
the
loom
of
illustration
chinese
calligraphy
the
return
of
me
ran
as
a
herald
runneth
the
leader
of
the
moon
and
the
spirit
of
the
wind
followed
after
me
quickening
his
the
return
of
in
the
chapter
of
the
holy
book
wherein
the
recompense
of
immortality
is
considered
may
be
found
the
legend
of
a
thousand
years
have
passed
since
the
passing
of
the
good
for
it
was
in
the
period
of
the
greatness
of
thang
that
he
lived
and
died
now
in
those
days
when
was
supreme
judge
of
one
of
the
six
august
tribunals
one
a
soldier
mighty
for
evil
lifted
the
black
banner
of
revolt
and
drew
after
him
as
a
tide
of
destruction
the
millions
of
the
northern
provinces
and
learning
of
these
things
and
knowing
also
that
was
the
most
ferocious
of
men
who
respected
nothing
on
earth
save
fearlessness
the
son
of
heaven
commanded
that
he
should
visit
and
strive
to
recall
the
rebel
to
duty
and
read
unto
the
people
who
followed
after
him
in
revolt
the
emperor
letter
of
reproof
and
warning
for
was
famed
throughout
the
provinces
for
his
wisdom
his
rectitude
and
his
fearlessness
and
the
son
of
heaven
believed
that
if
would
listen
to
the
words
of
any
living
man
steadfast
in
loyalty
and
virtue
he
would
listen
to
the
words
of
so
arrayed
himself
in
his
robes
of
office
and
set
his
house
in
order
and
having
embraced
his
wife
and
his
children
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
alone
to
the
roaring
camp
of
the
rebels
bearing
the
emperor
letter
in
his
bosom
i
shall
return
fear
not
were
his
last
words
to
the
gray
servant
who
watched
him
from
the
terrace
as
he
rode
and
at
last
descended
from
his
horse
and
entered
into
the
rebel
camp
and
passing
through
that
huge
gathering
of
war
stood
in
the
presence
of
high
sat
the
rebel
among
his
chiefs
encircled
by
the
of
swords
and
the
thunders
of
ten
thousand
gongs
above
him
undulated
the
silken
folds
of
the
black
dragon
while
a
vast
fire
rose
bickering
before
him
also
saw
that
the
tongues
of
that
fire
were
licking
human
bones
and
that
skulls
of
men
lay
blackening
among
the
ashes
yet
he
was
not
afraid
to
look
upon
the
fire
nor
into
the
eyes
of
but
drawing
from
his
bosom
the
roll
of
perfumed
yellow
silk
upon
which
the
words
of
the
emperor
were
written
and
kissing
it
he
made
ready
to
read
while
the
multitude
became
silent
then
in
a
strong
clear
voice
he
began
words
of
the
celestial
and
august
the
son
of
heaven
the
divine
unto
the
rebel
and
those
that
follow
and
a
roar
went
up
like
the
roar
of
the
sea
a
roar
of
rage
and
the
hideous
like
the
moan
of
a
forest
in
storm
and
the
brake
loose
and
the
thunder
of
the
gongs
moved
the
ground
beneath
the
messenger
feet
but
waved
his
gilded
wand
and
again
there
was
silence
nay
spake
the
rebel
chief
let
the
dog
bark
so
spake
on
thou
not
o
most
rash
and
foolish
of
men
that
thou
leadest
the
people
only
into
the
mouth
of
the
dragon
of
destruction
knowest
thou
not
also
that
the
people
of
my
kingdom
are
the
of
the
master
of
heaven
so
it
hath
been
written
that
he
who
doth
needlessly
subject
the
people
to
wounds
and
death
shall
not
be
suffered
by
heaven
to
live
thou
who
wouldst
subvert
those
laws
founded
by
the
wise
those
laws
in
obedience
to
which
may
happiness
and
prosperity
alone
be
found
thou
art
committing
the
greatest
of
all
crimes
the
crime
that
is
never
forgiven
my
people
think
not
that
i
your
emperor
i
your
father
seek
your
destruction
i
desire
only
your
happiness
your
prosperity
your
greatness
let
not
your
folly
provoke
the
severity
of
your
celestial
parent
follow
not
after
madness
and
blind
rage
hearken
rather
to
the
wise
words
of
my
roared
the
people
gathering
fury
till
the
mountains
rolled
back
the
cry
like
the
rolling
of
a
typhoon
and
once
more
the
pealing
of
the
gongs
paralyzed
voice
and
hearing
then
looking
at
saw
that
he
laughed
and
that
the
words
of
the
letter
would
not
again
be
listened
to
therefore
he
read
on
to
the
end
without
looking
about
him
resolved
to
perform
his
mission
in
so
far
as
lay
in
his
power
and
having
read
all
he
would
have
given
the
letter
to
but
would
not
extend
his
hand
to
take
it
therefore
replaced
it
in
his
bosom
and
folding
his
arms
looked
calmly
in
the
face
and
waited
again
waved
his
gilded
wand
and
the
roaring
ceased
and
the
booming
of
the
gongs
until
nothing
save
the
fluttering
of
the
could
be
heard
then
spake
with
an
evil
smile
o
son
of
a
dog
if
thou
dost
not
now
take
the
oath
of
fealty
and
bow
thyself
before
me
and
salute
me
with
the
salutation
of
emperors
even
with
the
the
triple
prostration
into
that
fire
thou
shalt
be
thrown
but
turning
his
back
upon
the
usurper
bowed
himself
a
moment
in
worship
to
heaven
and
earth
and
then
rising
suddenly
ere
any
man
could
lay
hand
upon
him
he
leaped
into
the
towering
flame
and
stood
there
with
folded
arms
like
a
god
then
leaped
to
his
feet
in
amazement
and
shouted
to
his
men
and
they
snatched
from
the
fire
and
wrung
the
flames
from
his
robes
with
their
naked
hands
and
extolled
him
and
praised
him
to
his
face
and
even
himself
descended
from
his
seat
and
spoke
fair
words
to
him
saying
o
i
see
thou
art
indeed
a
brave
man
and
true
and
worthy
of
all
honor
be
seated
among
us
i
pray
thee
and
partake
of
whatever
it
is
in
our
power
to
bestow
but
looking
upon
him
unswervingly
replied
in
a
voice
clear
as
the
voice
of
a
great
bell
never
o
shall
i
accept
aught
from
thy
hand
save
death
so
long
as
thou
shalt
continue
in
the
path
of
wrath
and
folly
and
never
shall
it
be
said
that
sat
him
down
among
rebels
and
traitors
among
murderers
and
robbers
then
in
sudden
fury
smote
him
with
his
sword
and
fell
to
the
earth
and
died
striving
even
in
his
death
to
bow
his
head
toward
the
south
toward
the
place
of
the
emperor
palace
toward
the
presence
of
his
beloved
master
even
at
the
same
hour
the
son
of
heaven
alone
in
the
inner
chamber
of
his
palace
became
aware
of
a
shape
prostrate
before
his
feet
and
when
he
spake
the
shape
arose
and
stood
before
him
and
he
saw
that
it
was
and
the
emperor
would
have
questioned
him
yet
ere
he
could
question
the
familiar
voice
spake
saying
son
of
heaven
the
mission
confided
to
me
i
have
performed
and
thy
command
hath
been
accomplished
to
the
extent
of
thy
humble
feeble
power
but
even
now
must
i
depart
that
i
may
enter
the
service
of
another
master
and
looking
the
emperor
perceived
that
the
golden
tigers
upon
the
wall
were
visible
through
the
form
of
and
a
strange
coldness
like
a
winter
wind
passed
through
the
chamber
and
the
figure
faded
out
then
the
emperor
knew
that
the
master
of
whom
his
faithful
servant
had
spoken
was
none
other
than
the
master
of
heaven
also
at
the
same
hour
the
gray
servant
of
house
beheld
him
passing
through
the
apartments
smiling
as
he
was
wont
to
smile
when
he
saw
that
all
things
were
as
he
desired
is
it
well
with
thee
my
lord
questioned
the
aged
man
and
a
voice
answered
him
it
is
well
but
the
presence
of
had
passed
away
before
the
answer
came
so
the
armies
of
the
son
of
heaven
strove
with
the
rebels
but
the
land
was
soaked
with
blood
and
blackened
with
fire
and
the
corpses
of
whole
populations
were
carried
by
the
rivers
to
feed
the
fishes
of
the
sea
and
still
the
war
prevailed
through
many
a
long
red
year
then
came
to
aid
the
son
of
heaven
the
hordes
that
dwell
in
the
desolations
of
the
west
and
north
horsemen
born
a
nation
of
wild
archers
each
mighty
to
bend
a
bow
until
the
ears
should
meet
and
as
a
whirlwind
they
came
against
rebellion
raining
arrows
in
a
storm
of
death
and
they
prevailed
against
and
his
people
then
those
that
survived
destruction
and
defeat
submitted
and
promised
allegiance
and
once
more
was
the
law
of
righteousness
restored
but
had
been
dead
for
many
summers
and
the
son
of
heaven
sent
word
to
his
victorious
generals
that
they
should
bring
back
with
them
the
bones
of
his
faithful
servant
to
be
laid
with
honor
in
a
mausoleum
erected
by
imperial
decree
so
the
generals
of
the
celestial
and
august
sought
after
the
nameless
grave
and
found
it
and
had
the
earth
taken
up
and
made
ready
to
remove
the
coffin
but
the
coffin
crumbled
into
dust
before
their
eyes
for
the
worms
had
gnawed
it
and
the
hungry
earth
had
devoured
its
substance
leaving
only
a
phantom
shell
that
vanished
at
touch
of
the
light
and
lo
as
it
vanished
all
beheld
lying
there
the
perfect
form
and
features
of
the
good
corruption
had
not
touched
him
nor
had
the
worms
disturbed
his
rest
nor
had
the
bloom
of
life
departed
from
his
face
and
he
seemed
to
dream
only
comely
to
see
as
upon
the
morning
of
his
bridal
and
smiling
as
the
holy
images
smile
with
eyelids
closed
in
the
twilight
of
the
great
pagodas
then
spoke
a
priest
standing
by
the
grave
o
my
children
this
is
indeed
a
sign
from
the
master
of
heaven
in
such
wise
do
the
powers
celestial
preserve
them
that
are
chosen
to
be
numbered
with
the
immortals
death
may
not
prevail
over
them
neither
may
corruption
come
nigh
them
verily
the
blessed
hath
taken
his
place
among
the
divinities
of
heaven
then
they
bore
back
to
his
native
place
and
laid
him
with
highest
honors
in
the
mausoleum
which
the
emperor
had
commanded
and
there
he
sleeps
incorruptible
forever
arrayed
in
his
robes
of
state
upon
his
tomb
are
sculptured
the
emblems
of
his
greatness
and
his
wisdom
and
his
virtue
and
the
signs
of
his
office
and

the

soared
to
the
highest

of
his
contemplation
bringing
his
soul
down
down
reeling
and
fluttering
back
to
the
world
of
illusion
again
the
memory
made
dizzy
his
thought
like
the
perfume
of
some
venomous
flower
yet
he
had
seen
the
bayadere
for
an
instant
only
when
passing
through
kas√≠
upon
his
way
to
china
to
the
vast
empire
of
souls
that
thirsted
after
the
refreshment
of
buddha
law
as
fields
thirst
for
the
rain
when
she
called
him
and
dropped
her
little
gift
into
his
bowl
he
had
indeed
lifted
his
fan
before
his
face
yet
not
quickly
enough
and
the
penally
of
that
fault
had
followed
him
a
thousand
leagues
pursued
after
him
even
into
the
strange
land
to
which
he
had
come
to
hear
the
words
of
the
universal
teacher
accursed
beauty
surely
framed
by
the
tempter
of
tempters
by
mara
himself
for
the
perdition
of
the
just
wisely
had
bhagavat
warned
his
disciples
o
ye
√ßramanas
women
are
not
to
be
looked
upon
and
if
ye
chance
to
meet
women
ye
must
not
suffer
your
eyes
to
dwell
upon
them
but
maintaining
holy
reserve
speak
not
to
them
at
all
then
fail
not
to
whisper
unto
your
own
hearts
we
are
√ßramanas
whose
duty
it
is
to
remain
uncontaminated
by
the
corruptions
of
this
world
even
as
the
lotos
which
suffereth
no
vileness
to
cling
unto
its
leaves
though
it
blossom
amid
the
refuse
of
the
wayside
ditch
then
also
came
to
his
memory
but
with
a
new
and
terrible
meaning
the
words
of
the
of
the
admonitions
of
all
attachments
unto
objects
of
desire
the
strongest
indeed
is
the
attachment
to
form
happily
this
passion
is
unique
for
were
there
any
other
like
unto
it
then
to
enter
the
perfect
way
were
impossible
how
indeed
thus
haunted
by
the
illusion
of
form
was
he
to
fulfil
the
vow
that
he
had
made
to
pass
a
night
and
a
day
in
perfect
and
unbroken
meditation
already
the
night
was
beginning
assuredly
for
sickness
of
the
soul
for
fever
of
the
spirit
there
was
no
physic
save
prayer
the
sunset
was
swiftly
fading
out
he
strove
to
pray
the
jewel
in
the
lotos
even
as
the
tortoise
withdraweth
its
extremities
into
its
shell
let
me
o
blessed
one
withdraw
my
senses
wholly
into
meditation
the
jewel
in
the
lotos
for
even
as
rain
penetrateth
the
broken
roof
of
a
dwelling
long
uninhabited
so
may
passion
enter
the
soul
uninhabited
by
meditation
the
jewel
in
the
lotos
even
as
still
water
that
hath
deposited
all
its
slime
so
let
my
soul
o
tath√¢gata
be
made
pure
give
me
strong
power
to
rise
above
the
world
o
master
even
as
the
wild
bird
rises
from
its
marsh
to
follow
the
pathway
of
the
sun
the
jewel
in
the
lotos
by
day
shineth
the
sun
by
night
shineth
the
moon
shineth
also
the
warrior
in
harness
of
war
shineth
likewise
in
meditations
the
√ßramana
but
the
buddha
at
all
times
by
night
or
by
day
shineth
ever
the
same
illuminating
the
world
the
jewel
in
the
lotos
let
me
cease
o
thou
perfectly
awakened
to
remain
as
an
ape
in
the
forever
ascending
and
descending
in
search
of
the
fruits
of
folly
swift
as
the
twining
of
serpents
vast
as
the
growth
of
lianas
in
a
forest
are
the
growths
of
the
plant
of
desire
the
jewel
in
the
lotos
vain
his
prayer
alas
vain
also
his
invocation
the
mystic
meaning
of
the
holy
text
the
sense
of
the
lotos
the
sense
of
the
jewel
had
evaporated
from
the
words
and
their
monotonous
utterance
now
served
only
to
lend
more
dangerous
definition
to
the
memory
that
tempted
and
tortured
him
the
jewel
in
her
ear
what
more
dainty
than
the
folded
flower
of
flesh
with
its
dripping
of
again
he
saw
it
and
the
curve
of
the
cheek
beyond
luscious
to
look
upon
as
beautiful
brown
fruit
how
true
the
two
hundred
and
verse
of
the
admonitions
so
long
as
a
man
shall
not
have
torn
from
his
heart
even
the
smallest
rootlet
of
that
liana
of
desire
which
draweth
his
thought
toward
women
even
so
long
shall
his
soul
remain
fettered
and
there
came
to
his
mind
also
the
three
hundred
and
verse
of
the
same
blessed
book
regarding
fetters
in
bonds
of
rope
wise
teachers
have
said
there
is
no
strength
nor
in
fetters
of
wood
nor
yet
in
fetters
of
iron
much
stronger
than
any
of
these
is
the
fetter
of
for
the
jewelled
earrings
of
omniscient
gotama
he
cried
tath√¢gata
how
multiform
the
consolation
of
thy
word
how
marvellous
thy
understanding
of
the
human
heart
was
this
also
one
of
thy
temptations
one
of
the
myriad
illusions
marshalled
before
thee
by
mara
in
that
night
when
the
earth
rocked
as
a
chariot
and
the
sacred
trembling
passed
from
sun
to
sun
from
system
to
system
from
universe
to
universe
from
eternity
to
eternity
the
jewel
in
her
ear
the
vision
would
not
go
nay
each
time
it
hovered
before
his
thought
it
seemed
to
take
a
warmer
life
a
fonder
look
a
fairer
form
to
develop
with
his
weakness
to
gain
force
from
his
enervation
he
saw
the
eyes
large
limpid
soft
and
black
as
a
deer
the
pearls
in
the
dark
hair
and
the
pearls
in
the
pink
mouth
the
lips
curling
to
a
kiss
a
and
a
fragrance
seemed
to
float
to
his
senses
sweet
strange
soporific
a
perfume
of
youth
an
odor
of
woman
rising
to
his
feet
with
strong
resolve
he
pronounced
again
the
sacred
invocation
and
he
recited
the
holy
words
of
the
of
gazing
upon
the
heavens
and
upon
the
earth
ye
must
say
are
not
gazing
upon
the
mountains
and
the
rivers
ye
must
say
are
not
gazing
upon
the
forms
and
upon
the
faces
of
exterior
beings
and
beholding
their
growth
and
their
development
ye
must
say
are
not
and
nevertheless
how
sweet
illusion
the
illusion
of
the
great
sun
the
illusion
of
the
hills
the
illusion
of
waters
formless
and
multiform
the
illusion
of
nay
nay
i
what
impious
fancy
accursed
girl
yet
yet
why
should
he
curse
her
had
she
ever
done
aught
to
merit
the
malediction
of
an
ascetic
never
never
only
her
form
the
memory
of
her
the
beautiful
phantom
of
her
the
accursed
phantom
of
her
what
was
she
an
illusion
creating
illusions
a
mockery
a
dream
a
shadow
a
vanity
a
vexation
of
spirit
the
fault
the
sin
was
in
himself
in
his
rebellious
thought
in
his
untamed
memory
though
mobile
as
water
intangible
as
vapor
thought
nevertheless
may
be
tamed
by
the
will
may
be
harnessed
to
the
chariot
of
wisdom
must
be
that
happiness
be
found
and
he
recited
the
blessed
verses
of
the
book
of
the
way
of
the
law
forms
are
only
when
this
great
truth
is
fully
comprehended
by
any
one
then
is
he
delivered
from
all
pain
this
is
the
way
of
purification
forms
are
subject
unto
when
this
great
truth
is
fully
comprehended
by
any
one
then
is
he
delivered
from
all
pain
this
is
the
way
of
purification
forms
are
without
substantial
when
this
great
truth
is
fully
comprehended
by
any
one
then
is
he
delivered
from
all
pain
this
is
the
way
of
form
too
unsubstantial
unreal
an
illusion
only
though
comeliest
of
illusions
she
had
given
him
alms
was
the
merit
of
the
giver
illusive
also
illusive
like
the
grace
of
the
supple
fingers
that
gave
assuredly
there
were
mysteries
in
the
abhidharma
impenetrable
incomprehensible
it
was
a
golden
coin
stamped
with
the
symbol
of
an
elephant
not
more
of
an
illusion
indeed
than
the
gifts
of
kings
to
the
buddha
gold
upon
her
bosom
also
less
fine
than
the
gold
of
her
skin
naked
between
the
silken
sash
and
the
narrow
her
young
waist
curved
glossy
and
pliant
as
a
bow
richer
the
silver
in
her
voice
than
in
the
hollow
that
made
a
moonlight
about
her
ankles
but
her
smile
the
little
teeth
like
in
the
perfumed
blossom
of
her
mouth
o
weakness
o
shame
how
had
the
strong
charioteer
of
resolve
thus
lost
his
control
over
the
wild
team
of
fancy
was
this
languor
of
the
will
a
signal
of
coming
peril
the
peril
of
slumber
so
strangely
vivid
those
fancies
were
so
brightly
definite
as
about
to
take
visible
form
to
move
with
factitious
life
to
play
some
unholy
drama
upon
the
stage
of
dreams
o
thou
fully
awakened
he
cried
aloud
help
now
thy
humble
disciple
to
obtain
the
blessed
wakefulness
of
perfect
contemplation
let
him
find
force
to
fulfil
his
vow
suffer
not
mara
to
prevail
against
him
and
he
recited
the
eternal
verses
of
the
chapter
of
wakefulness
and
eternally
awake
are
the
disciples
of
gotama
unceasingly
by
day
and
night
their
thoughts
are
fixed
upon
the
law
and
eternally
awake
are
the
disciples
of
gotama
unceasingly
by
day
and
night
their
thoughts
are
fixed
upon
the
community
and
eternally
awake
are
the
disciples
of
gotama
unceasingly
by
day
and
night
their
thoughts
are
fixed
upon
the
body
and
eternally
awake
are
the
disciples
of
gotama
unceasingly
by
day
and
night
their
minds
know
the
sweetness
of
perfect
peace
and
eternally
awake
are
the
disciples
of
gotama
unceasingly
by
day
and
night
their
minds
enjoy
the
deep
peace
of
meditation
there
came
a
murmur
to
his
ears
a
murmuring
of
many
voices
smothering
the
utterances
of
his
own
like
a
tumult
of
waters
the
stars
went
out
before
his
sight
the
heavens
darkened
their
infinities
all
things
became
viewless
became
blackness
and
the
great
murmur
deepened
like
the
murmur
of
a
rising
tide
and
the
earth
seemed
to
sink
from
beneath
him
his
feet
no
longer
touched
the
ground
a
sense
of
supernatural
buoyancy
pervaded
every
fibre
of
his
body
he
felt
himself
floating
in
obscurity
then
sinking
softly
slowly
like
a
feather
dropped
from
the
pinnacle
of
a
temple
was
this
death
nay
for
all
suddenly
as
transported
by
the
sixth
supernatural
power
he
stood
again
in
light
a
perfumed
sleepy
light
vapory
beautiful
that
bathed
the
marvellous
streets
of
some
indian
city
now
the
nature
of
the
murmur
became
manifest
to
him
for
he
moved
with
a
mighty
throng
a
people
of
pilgrims
a
nation
of
worshippers
but
these
were
not
of
his
faith
they
bore
upon
their
foreheads
the
smeared
symbols
of
obscene
gods
still
he
could
not
escape
from
their
midst
the
human
torrent
bore
him
irresistibly
with
it
as
a
leaf
is
swept
by
the
waters
of
the
ganges
rajahs
were
there
with
their
trains
and
princes
riding
upon
elephants
and
brahmins
robed
in
their
vestments
and
swarms
of
voluptuous
moving
to
chant
of
and
but
whither
whither
out
of
the
city
into
the
sun
they
passed
between
avenues
of
banyan
down
colonnades
of
palm
but
whither
whither
a
mountain
of
carven
stone
appeared
before
them
the
temple
lifting
to
heaven
its
wilderness
of
chiselled
pinnacles
flinging
to
the
sky
the
golden
spray
of
its
decoration
higher
it
grew
with
approach
the
blue
tones
changed
to
gray
the
outlines
sharpened
in
the
light
then
each
detail
became
visible
the
elephants
of
the
pedestals
standing
upon
tortoises
of
rock
the
great
grim
faces
of
the
capitals
the
serpents
and
monsters
writhing
among
the
friezes
the
gods
of
basalt
in
their
galleries
of
fretted
niches
tier
above
tier
the
pictured
foulnesses
the
painted
lusts
the
divinities
of
abomination
and
yawning
in
the
sloping
precipice
of
sculpture
beneath
a
frenzied
swarming
of
gods
and
gopia
a
beetling
pyramid
of
limbs
and
bodies
interlocked
the
gate
cavernous
and
shadowy
as
the
mouth
of
siva
devoured
the
living
multitude
the
eddy
of
the
throng
whirled
him
with
it
to
the
vastness
of
the
interior
none
seemed
to
note
his
yellow
robe
none
even
to
observe
his
presence
giant
aisles
intercrossed
their
heights
above
him
myriads
of
mighty
pillars
fantastically
carven
filed
away
to
invisibility
behind
the
yellow
illumination
of
strange
images
weirdly
sensuous
loomed
up
through
haze
of
incense
colossal
figures
that
at
a
distance
assumed
the
form
of
elephants
or
changed
aspect
when
approached
and
revealed
as
the
secret
of
their
design
an
interplaiting
of
the
bodies
of
women
while
one
divinity
rode
all
the
monstrous
allegories
one
divinity
or
demon
eternally
the
same
in
the
repetition
of
the
sculptor
universally
visible
as
though
the
huge
pillars
themselves
were
symbols
figures
carnalities
the
orgiastic
spirit
of
that
worship
lived
and
writhed
in
the
contorted
bronze
of
the
lamps
the
twisted
gold
of
the
cups
the
chiselled
marble
of
the
tanks
how
far
had
he
proceeded
he
knew
not
the
journey
among
those
countless
columns
past
those
armies
of
petrified
gods
down
lanes
of
flickering
lights
seemed
longer
than
the
voyage
of
a
caravan
longer
than
his
pilgrimage
to
china
but
suddenly
inexplicably
there
came
a
silence
as
of
cemeteries
the
living
ocean
seemed
to
have
ebbed
away
from
about
him
to
have
been
engulfed
within
abysses
of
subterranean
architecture
he
found
himself
alone
in
some
strange
crypt
before
a
basin
and
shallow
bearing
in
its
centre
a
rounded
column
of
less
than
human
height
whose
smooth
and
spherical
summit
was
wreathed
with
flowers
lamps
similarly
formed
and
fed
with
oil
of
palm
hung
above
it
there
was
no
other
graven
image
no
visible
divinity
flowers
of
countless
varieties
lay
heaped
upon
the
pavement
they
covered
its
surface
like
a
carpet
thick
soft
they
exhaled
their
ghosts
beneath
his
feet
the
perfume
seemed
to
penetrate
his
brain
a
perfume
sensuous
intoxicating
unholy
an
unconquerable
languor
mastered
his
will
and
he
sank
to
rest
upon
the
floral
offerings
the
sound
of
a
tread
light
as
a
whisper
approached
through
the
heavy
stillness
with
a
drowsy
tinkling
of
a
tintinnabulation
of
anklets
all
suddenly
he
felt
glide
about
his
neck
the
tepid
smoothness
of
a
woman
arm
she
his
illusion
his
temptation
but
how
transformed
transfigured
preternatural
in
her
loveliness
incomprehensible
in
her
charm
delicate
as
a
the
cheek
that
touched
his
own
deep
as
night
sweet
as
summer
the
eyes
that
watched
him
her
whispered
how
have
i
sought
for
thee
how
have
i
found
thee
sweets
i
bring
thee
my
beloved
lips
and
bosom
fruit
and
blossom
hast
thirst
drink
from
the
well
of
mine
eyes
wouldst
sacrifice
i
am
thine
altar
wouldst
pray
i
am
thy
god
their
lips
touched
her
kiss
seemed
to
change
the
cells
of
his
blood
to
flame
for
a
moment
illusion
triumphed
mara
prevailed
with
a
shock
of
resolve
the
dreamer
awoke
in
the
night
under
the
stars
of
the
chinese
sky
only
a
mockery
of
sleep
but
the
vow
had
been
violated
the
sacred
purpose
unfulfilled
humiliated
penitent
but
resolved
the
ascetic
drew
from
his
girdle
a
keen
knife
and
with
unfaltering
hands
severed
his
eyelids
from
his
eyes
and
flung
them
from
him
o
thou
perfectly
awakened
he
prayed
thy
disciple
hath
not
been
overcome
save
through
the
feebleness
of
the
body
and
his
vow
hath
been
renewed
here
shall
he
linger
without
food
or
drink
until
the
moment
of
its
fulfilment
and
having
assumed
the
hieratic
posture
seated
himself
with
his
lower
limbs
folded
beneath
him
and
the
palms
of
his
hands
upward
the
right
upon
the
left
the
left
resting
upon
the
sole
of
his
upturned
foot
he
resumed
his
meditation
dawn
blushed
day
brightened
the
sun
shortened
all
the
shadows
of
the
land
and
lengthened
them
again
and
sank
at
last
upon
his
funeral
pyre
of
cloud
night
came
and
glittered
and
passed
but
mara
had
tempted
in
vain
this
time
the
vow
had
been
fulfilled
the
holy
purpose
accomplished
and
again
the
sun
arose
to
fill
the
world
with
laughter
of
light
flowers
opened
their
hearts
to
him
birds
sang
their
morning
hymn
of
fire
worship
the
deep
forest
trembled
with
delight
and
far
upon
the
plain
the
eaves
of
temples
and
the
peaked
caps
of
the
caught
aureate
glory
strong
in
the
holiness
of
his
accomplished
vow
the
indian
pilgrim
arose
in
the
morning
glow
he
started
for
amazement
as
he
lifted
his
hands
to
his
eyes
what
was
everything
a
dream
impossible
yet
now
his
eyes
felt
no
pain
neither
were
they
lidless
not
even
so
much
as
one
of
their
lashes
was
lacking
what
marvel
had
been
wrought
in
vain
he
looked
for
the
severed
lids
that
he
had
flung
upon
the
ground
they
had
mysteriously
vanished
but
lo
there
where
he
had
cast
them
two
wondrous
shrubs
were
growing
with
dainty
leaflets
and
snowy
buds
just
opening
to
the
east
then
by
virtue
of
the
supernatural
power
acquired
in
that
mighty
meditation
it
was
given
the
holy
missionary
to
know
the
secret
of
that
newly
created
plant
the
subtle
virtue
of
its
leaves
and
he
named
it
in
the
language
of
the
nation
to
whom
he
brought
the
lotos
of
the
good
law
and
he
spake
to
it
saying
blessed
be
thou
sweet
plant
beneficent
formed
by
the
spirit
of
virtuous
resolve
lo
the
fame
of
thee
shall
yet
spread
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
the
perfume
of
thy
life
be
borne
unto
the
uttermost
parts
by
all
the
winds
of
heaven
verily
for
all
time
to
come
men
who
drink
of
thy
sap
shall
find
such
refreshment
that
weariness
may
not
overcome
them
nor
languor
seize
upon
them
neither
shall
they
know
the
confusion
of
drowsiness
nor
any
desire
for
slumber
in
the
hour
of
duty
or
of
prayer
blessed
be
thou
and
still
as
a
mist
of
incense
as
a
smoke
of
universal
sacrifice

ascends
to

from

the
tale
of
the
is
written
in
the
that
whenever
the
artist
was
in
doubt
he
would
look
into
the
fire
of
the
great
oven
in
which
his
vases
were
baking
and
question
the
dwelling
in
the
flame
and
the
spirit
of
the
so
aided
him
with
his
counsels
that
the
porcelains
made
by
were
indeed
finer
and
lovelier
to
look
upon
than
all
other
porcelains
and
they
were
baked
in
the
years
of
sacredly
called
jin
the
tale
of
the
who
first
of
men
discovered
the
secret
of
the
of
the
the
bones
and
the
flesh
the
skeleton
and
the

a
man
now
a
god
before
whose
snowy
statues
bow
the
myriad
populations
enrolled
in
the
guilds
of

potteries
but
the
place
of
his
birth
we
know
not
perhaps
the
tradition
of
it
may
have
been
effaced
from
remembrance
by
that
awful
war
which
in
our
own
day
consumed
the
lives
of
twenty
millions
of
the
race

obliterated
from

thousand

ago
taught
men
to
make
good
vessels
of

clay

in

time

had
learned
to
know
the
god

turned
their
wheels
to
the
murmuring
of
prayer

had
been

unto

fathers

ten
hundred

a

matchless
art
that
pu
bequeathed
unto
men
may
indeed
have
been
forgotten
and
lost
forever
the
story
of
the
is
remembered
and
i
doubt
not
that
any
of
the
aged
any
one
of
the
old
blind
men
of
the
great
potteries
who
sit
all
day
grinding
colors
in
the
sun
could
tell
you
pu
was
once
a
humble
chinese
workman
who
grew
to
be
a
great
artist
by
dint
of
tireless
study
and
patience
and
by
the
inspiration
of
heaven
so
famed
he
became
that
some
deemed
him
an
alchemist
who
possessed
the
secret
called
by
which
stones
might
be
turned
into
gold
and
others
thought
him
a
magician
having
the
ghastly
power
of
murdering
men
with
horror
of
nightmare
by
hiding
charmed
effigies
of
them
under
the
tiles
of
their
own
roofs
and
others
again
averred
that
he
was
an
astrologer
who
had
discovered
the
mystery
of
those
five
hing
which
influence
all
things
those
powers
that
move
even
in
the
currents
of
the
in
the
milky
or
river
of
the
sky
thus
at
least
the
ignorant
spoke
of
him
but
even
those
who
stood
about
the
son
of
heaven
those
whose
hearts
had
been
strengthened
by
the
acquisition
of
wisdom
wildly
praised
the
marvels
of
his
handicraft
and
asked
each
other
if
there
might
be
any
imaginable
form
of
beauty
which
pu
could
not
evoke
from
that
beauteous
substance
so
docile
to
the
touch
of
his
cunning
hand
and
one
day
it
came
to
pass
that
pu
sent
a
priceless
gift
to
the
celestial
and
august
a
vase
imitating
the
substance
of
all
aflame
with
pyritic
scintillation
a
shape
of
glittering
splendor
with
chameleons
sprawling
over
it
chameleons
of
porcelain
that
shifted
color
as
often
as
the
beholder
changed
his
position
and
the
emperor
wondering
exceedingly
at
the
splendor
of
the
work
questioned
the
princes
and
the
mandarins
concerning
him
that
made
it
and
the
princes
and
the
mandarins
answered
that
he
was
a
workman
named
pu
and
that
he
was
without
equal
among
potters
knowing
secrets
that
seemed
to
have
been
inspired
either
by
gods
or
by
demons
whereupon
the
son
of
heaven
sent
his
officers
to
pu
with
a
noble
gift
and
summoned
him
unto
his
presence
so
the
humble
artisan
entered
before
the
emperor
and
having
performed
the
supreme
prostration
thrice
kneeling
and
thrice
nine
times
touching
the
ground
with
his
forehead
awaited
the
command
of
the
august
and
the
emperor
spake
to
him
saying
son
thy
gracious
gift
hath
found
high
favor
in
our
sight
and
for
the
charm
of
that
offering
we
have
bestowed
upon
thee
a
reward
of
five
thousand
silver
but
thrice
that
sum
shall
be
awarded
thee
so
soon
as
thou
shalt
have
fulfilled
our
behest
hearken
therefore
o
matchless
artificer
it
is
now
our
will
that
thou
make
for
us
a
vase
having
the
tint
and
the
aspect
of
living
flesh
but
mark
well
our
desire
flesh
made
to
creep
by
the
utterance
of
such
words
as
poets
utter
flesh
moved
by
an
idea
flesh
horripilated
by
a
thought
obey
and
answer
not
we
have
spoken
now
pu
was
the
most
cunning
of
all
the
the
men
who
marry
colors
together
of
all
the
who
draw
the
shapes
of
of
all
the
who
paint
in
enamel
of
all
the
who
brighten
color
of
all
the
who
watch
the
and
the
but
he
went
away
sorrowing
from
the
palace
of
the
son
of
heaven
notwithstanding
the
gift
of
five
thousand
silver
which
had
been
given
to
him
for
he
thought
to
himself
surely
the
mystery
of
the
comeliness
of
flesh
and
the
mystery
of
that
by
which
it
is
moved
are
the
secrets
of
the
supreme
tao
how
shall
man
lend
the
aspect

who

now
pu
had
discovered
those
witchcrafts
of
color
those
surprises
of
grace
that
make
the
art
of
the
ceramist
he
had
found
the
secret
of
the
the
wizard
flush
of
the
rose
of
the
the
delicious
incarnadine
of
the
called
of
the
pale
soft
yellow
termed
and
of
the
which
is
the
blazing
beauty
of
gold
he
had
found
those
those
those
those
those
carminates
and
lilacs
subtle
as
which
our
enamellists
of
the
occident
long
sought
without
success
to
reproduce
but
he
trembled
at
the
task
assigned
him
as
he
returned
to
the
toil
of
his
studio
saying
how
shall
any
miserable
man
render
in
clay
the
quivering
of
flesh
to
an
idea
the
inexplicable
horripilation
of
a
thought
shall
a
man
venture
to
mock
the
magic
of
that
eternal
moulder
by
whose
infinite
power
a
million
suns
are
shapen
more
readily
than
one
small
jar
might
be
rounded
upon
my
wheel
yet
the
command
of
the
celestial
and
august
might
never
be
disobeyed
and
the
patient
workman
strove
with
all
his
power
to
fulfil
the
son
of
heaven
desire
but
vainly
for
days
for
weeks
for
months
for
season
after
season
did
he
strive
vainly
also
he
prayed
unto
the
gods
to
aid
him
vainly
he
besought
the
spirit
of
the
furnace
crying
o
thou
spirit
of
fire
hear
me
heed
me
help
me
how
shall
i
a
miserable
man
unable
to
breathe
into
clay
a
living
soul
how
shall
i
render
in
this
inanimate
substance
the
aspect
of
flesh
made
to
creep
by
the
utterance
of
a
word
sentient
to
the
horripilation
of
a
thought
for
the
spirit
of
the
furnace
made
strange
answer
to
him
with
whispering
of
fire
thy
faith
weird
thy
prayer
has
thought
feet
that
man
may
perceive
the
trace
of
its
passing
canst
thou
measure
me
the
blast
of
the
wind
nevertheless
with
purpose
unmoved
times
did
pu
seek
to
fulfil
the
emperor
command
times
he
strove
to
obey
the
behest
of
the
son
of
heaven
vainly
alas
did
he
consume
his
substance
vainly
did
he
expend
his
strength
vainly
did
he
exhaust
his
knowledge
success
smiled
not
upon
him
and
evil
visited
his
home
and
poverty
sat
in
his
dwelling
and
misery
shivered
at
his
hearth
sometimes
when
the
hour
of
trial
came
it
was
found
that
the
colors
had
become
strangely
transmuted
in
the
firing
or
had
faded
into
ashen
pallor
or
had
darkened
into
the
fuliginous
hue
of
and
pu
beholding
these
misfortunes
made
wail
to
the
spirit
of
the
furnace
praying
o
thou
spirit
of
fire
how
shall
i
render
the
likeness
of
lustrous
flesh
the
warm
glow
of
living
color
unless
thou
aid
me
and
the
spirit
of
the
furnace
mysteriously
answered
him
with
murmuring
of
fire
thou
learn
the
art
of
that
infinite
enameller
who
hath
made
beautiful
the
arch
of
heaven
whose
brush
is
light
whose
paints
are
the
colors
of
the
evening
sometimes
again
even
when
the
tints
had
not
changed
after
the
pricked
and
labored
surface
had
seemed
about
to
quicken
in
the
heat
to
assume
the
vibratility
of
living
skin
even
at
the
last
hour
all
the
labor
of
the
workers
proved
to
have
been
wasted
for
the
fickle
substance
rebelled
against
their
efforts
producing
only
crinklings
grotesque
as
those
upon
the
rind
of
a
withered
fruit
or
granulations
like
those
upon
the
skin
of
a
dead
bird
from
which
the
feathers
have
been
rudely
plucked
and
pu
wept
and
cried
out
unto
the
spirit
of
the
furnace
o
thou
spirit
of
flame
how
shall
i
be
able
to
imitate
the
thrill
of
flesh
touched
by
a
thought
unless
thou
wilt
vouchsafe
to
lend
me
thine
aid
and
the
spirit
of
the
furnace
mysteriously
answered
him
with
muttering
of
fire
thou
give
ghost
unto
a
stone
canst
thou
thrill
with
a
thought
the
entrails
of
the
granite
hills
sometimes
it
was
found
that
all
the
work
indeed
had
not
failed
for
the
color
seemed
good
and
all
faultless
the
matter
of
the
vase
appeared
to
be
having
neither
crack
nor
wrinkling
nor
crinkling
but
the
pliant
softness
of
warm
skin
did
not
meet
the
eye
the
surface
offered
only
the
harsh
aspect
and
hard
glimmer
of
metal
all
their
exquisite
toil
to
mock
the
pulpiness
of
sentient
substance
had
left
no
trace
had
been
brought
to
nought
by
the
breath
of
the
furnace
and
pu
in
his
despair
shrieked
to
the
spirit
of
the
furnace
o
thou
merciless
divinity
o
thou
most
pitiless
god
thou
whom
i
have
worshipped
with
ten
thousand
sacrifices
for
what
fault
hast
thou
abandoned
me
for
what
error
hast
thou
forsaken
me
how
may
i
most
wretched
of
men
ever
render
the
aspect
of
flesh
made
to
creep
with
the
utterance
of
a
word
sentient
to
the
titillation
of
a
thought
if
thou
wilt
not
aid
me
and
the
spirit
of
the
furnace
made
answer
unto
him
with
roaring
of
fire
thou
divide
a
soul
nay
thy
life
for
the
life
of
thy
work
thy
soul
for
the
soul
of
thy
vase
and
hearing
these
words
pu
arose
with
a
terrible
resolve
swelling
at
his
heart
and
made
ready
for
the
last
and
fiftieth
time
to
fashion
his
work
for
the
oven
one
hundred
times
did
he
sift
the
clay
and
the
quartz
the
and
the
one
hundred
times
did
he
purify
them
in
clearest
water
one
hundred
times
with
tireless
hands
did
he
knead
the
creamy
paste
mingling
it
at
last
with
colors
known
only
to
himself
then
was
the
vase
shapen
and
reshapen
and
touched
and
retouched
by
the
hands
of
pu
until
its
blandness
seemed
to
live
until
it
appeared
to
quiver
and
to
palpitate
as
with
vitality
from
within
as
with
the
quiver
of
rounded
muscle
undulating
beneath
the
integument
for
the
hues
of
life
were
upon
it
and
infiltrated
throughout
its
innermost
substance
imitating
the
carnation
of
tissue
and
the
reticulated
purple
of
the
veins
and
over
all
was
laid
the
envelope
of
the
lucid
and
glossy
enamel
half
diaphanous
even
like
the
substance
that
it
counterfeited
the
polished
skin
of
a
woman
never
since
the
making
of
the
world
had
any
work
comparable
to
this
been
wrought
by
the
skill
of
man
then
pu
bade
those
who
aided
him
that
they
should
feed
the
furnace
well
with
wood
of
but
he
told
his
resolve
unto
none
yet
after
the
oven
began
to
glow
and
he
saw
the
work
of
his
hands
blossoming
and
blushing
in
the
heat
he
bowed
himself
before
the
spirit
of
flame
and
murmured
o
thou
spirit
and
master
of
fire
i
know
the
truth
of
thy
words
i
know
that
a
soul
may
never
be
divided
therefore
my
life
for
the
life
of
my
work
my
soul
for
the
soul
of
my
vase
and
for
nine
days
and
for
eight
nights
the
furnaces
were
fed
unceasingly
with
wood
of
for
nine
days
and
for
eight
nights
men
watched
the
wondrous
vase
crystallizing
into
being
by
the
breath
of
the
flame
now
upon
the
coming
of
the
ninth
night
pu
bade
all
his
weary
comrades
retire
to
rest
for
that
the
work
was
done
and
the
success
assured
if
you
find
me
not
here
at
sunrise
he
said
fear
not
to
take
forth
the
vase
for
i
know
that
the
task
will
have
been
accomplished
according
to
the
command
of
the
august
so
they
departed
but
in
that
same
ninth
night
pu
entered
the
flame
and
yielded
up
his
ghost
in
the
embrace
of
the
spirit
of
the
furnace
giving
his
life
for
the
life
of
his
work
his
soul
for
the
soul
of
his
vase
and
when
the
workmen
came
upon
the
tenth
morning
to
take
forth
the
porcelain
marvel
even
the
bones
of
pu
had
ceased
to
be
but
lo
the
vase
lived
as
they
looked
upon
it
seeming
to
be
flesh
moved
by
the
utterance
of
a
word
creeping
to
the
titillation
of
a
thought
and
whenever
tapped
by
the
finger
it
uttered
a
voice
and
a
name
the
voice
of
its
maker
the
name
of
its
creator
pu
and
the
son
of
heaven
hearing
of
these
things
and
viewing
the
miracle
of
the
vase
said
unto
those
about
him
verily
the
impossible
hath
been
wrought
by
the
strength
of
faith
by
the
force
of
obedience
yet
never
was
it
our
desire
that
so
cruel
a
sacrifice
should
have
been
we
sought
only
to
know
whether
the
skill
of
the
matchless
artificer
came
from
the
divinities
or
from
the
demons
from
heaven
or
from
hell
now
indeed
we
discern
that
pu
hath
taken
his
place
among
the
gods
and
the
emperor
mourned
exceedingly
for
his
faithful
servant
but
he
ordained
that
godlike
honors
should
be
paid
unto
the
spirit
of
the
marvellous
artist
and
that
his
memory
should
be
revered
forevermore
and
that
fair
statues
of
him
should
be
set
up
in
all
the
cities
of
the
celestial
empire
and
above
all
the
toiling
of
the
potteries
that
the
multitude
of
workers
might
unceasingly
call
upon
his
name
and
invoke
his
benediction
upon
their
labors

who

obtain
the

to

to

him
a

the
master
of

took
pity
on
him

become
his
wife
she
wove
a
piece
of
silk
for
him
every
day
until
she
was
able
to
buy
his
freedom
after
which
she
gave
him
a
son
and
went
back
to
french
lest
the

should
suppose
however
that
i
have
drawn
wholly
upon

may

is
very
pithily

tradition
of
the
my
authority
for
this
bit
of
folklore
is
the
brief
statement
published
by
bretschneider
in
the
chinese
recorder
for
a
japanese
legend
says
that
about
a
buddhist
priest
came
to
china
and
in
order
to
dedicate
his
soul
entirely
to
god
he
made
a
vow
to
pass
the
day
and
night
in
an
uninterrupted
and
unbroken
meditation
after
many
years
of
this
continual
watching
he
was
at
length
so
tired
that
he
fell
asleep
on
awaking
the
following
morning
he
was
so
sorry
he
had
broken
his
vow
that
he
cut
off
both
his
eyelids
and
threw
them
upon
the
ground
returning
to
the
same
place
the
following
day
he
observed
that
each
eyelid
had
become
a
shrub
this
was
the
unknown
until
that
time
bretschneider
adds
that
the
legend
in
question
seems
not
to
be
known
to
the
chinese
yet
in
view
of
the
fact
that
buddhism
itself
with
all
its
marvellous
legends
was
received
by
the
japanese
from
china
it
is
certainly
probable
this
legend
had
a
chinese
origin
subsequently
disguised
by
japanese
chronology
my
buddhist
texts
were
drawn
from
fernand
h√ª
translation
of
the
dhammapada
and
from
leon
translation
from
the
thibetan
of
the
sutra
in
articles
an
orientalist
who
should
condescend
in
a
rare
to
glance
at
my
work
might
also
discover
that
i
had
borrowed
an
idea
or
two
from
the
sanscrit
poet
tale
of
the
the
good
p√®re
who
first
gave
to
europe
the
secrets
of
chinese
wrote
one
hundred
and
sixty
years
ago
the
emperors
of
china
are
during
their
lifetime
the
most
redoubted
of
divinities
and
they
believe
that
nothing
should
ever
stand
in
the
way
of
their
desires
it
is
related
that
once
upon
a
time
a
certain
emperor
insisted
that
some
porcelains
should
be
made
for
him
according
to
a
model
which
he
gave
it
was
answered
that
the
thing
was
simply
impossible
but
all
such
remonstrances
only
served
to
excite
his
desire
more
and
more
the
officers
charged
by
the
demigod
to
supervise
and
hasten
the
work
treated
the
workmen
with
great
harshness
the
poor
wretches
spent
all
their
money
took
exceeding
pains
and
received
only
blows
in
return
one
of
them
in
a
fit
of
despair
leaped
into
the
blazing
furnace
and
was
instantly
burnt
to
ashes
but
the
porcelain
that
was
being
baked
there
at
the
time
came
out
they
say
perfectly
beautiful
and
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
emperor
from
that
time
the
unfortunate
workman
was
regarded
as
a
hero
and
his
image
was
made
the
idol
which
presides
over
the
manufacture
of
porcelain
it
appears
that
mistook
the
statue
of
god
of
comfort
for
that
of
the
real
as
jacquemart
and
others
observe
this
error
does
not
however
destroy
the
beauty
of
the
myth
and
there
is
no
good
reason
to
doubt
that
related
it
as
it
had
been
told
him
by
some
of
his
chinese
friends
at
the
researches
of
stanislas
julien
and
others
have
only
tended
to
confirm
the
trustworthiness
of
the
catholic
missionary
statements
in
other
respects

length

him
the
highest
praise
as
a
conscientious
investigator
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
learn
remains
the
sole
authority
for
the
myth
but
his
affirmations
in
regard
to
other
matters
have
withstood
the
severe
tests
of
time
astonishingly
well
and
since
the
rebellion
destroyed
and
paralyzed
its
noble
industry
the
value
of
the
french
missionary
documents
and
testimony
has
become
widely
recognized
in
lieu
of
any
other
name
for
the
hero
of
the
