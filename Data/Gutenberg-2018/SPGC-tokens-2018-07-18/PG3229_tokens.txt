of
the
coming
of
paris
to
the
house
of
menelaus
king
of
lacedaemon
and
of
the
tale
paris
told
concerning
his
past
life
i
all
day
within
the
palace
of
the
king
in
lacedaemon
was
there
revelry
since
menelaus
with
the
dawn
did
spring
forth
from
his
carven
couch
and
climbing
high
the
tower
of
outlook
gazed
along
the
dry
white
road
that
runs
to
pylos
through
the
plain
and
mark
thin
clouds
of
dust
against
the
sky
and
gleaming
bronze
and
robes
of
purple
stain
ii
then
cried
he
to
his
serving
men
and
all
obey
him
and
their
labour
did
not
spare
and
women
set
out
tables
through
the
hall
light
polish
tables
with
the
linen
fair
and
water
from
the
well
did
others
bear
and
the
good
busily
brought
forth
meats
from
her
store
and
stinted
not
the
rare
wine
from
ismarian
vineyards
of
the
north
iii
the
men
drave
up
a
heifer
from
the
field
for
sacrifice
and
sheath
her
horns
with
gold
and
strong
boethous
the
axe
did
wield
and
smote
her
on
the
fruitful
earth
she
roll
and
they
her
limbs
divided
fold
on
fold
they
laid
the
fat
and
cast
upon
the
fire
the
barley
grain
such
rites
were
wrought
of
old
when
all
was
order
as
the
gods
desire
iv
and
now
the
chariots
came
beneath
the
trees
hard
by
the
palace
portals
in
the
shade
and
menelaus
knew
king
diocles
of
pherae
sprung
of
an
unhappy
maid
whom
the
great
elian
river
god
in
the
still
watches
of
a
summer
night
when
by
his
deep
green
she
and
lean
to
pluck
his
white
besides
king
diocles
there
sat
a
man
of
all
men
mortal
sure
the
fairest
far
for
his
purple
robe
sidonian
his
yellow
hair
shone
brighter
than
the
star
of
the
long
golden
locks
that
bodeth
war
his
face
was
like
the
sunshine
and
his
blue
glad
eyes
no
sorrow
had
the
spell
to
mar
were
clear
as
skies
the
storm
hath
thunder
through
vi
then
menelaus
spake
unto
his
folk
and
eager
at
his
word
they
ran
amain
and
loosed
the
sweating
horses
from
the
yoke
and
cast
before
them
spelt
and
barley
grain
and
lean
the
polish
car
with
golden
rein
against
the
shining
spaces
of
the
wall
and
called
the
who
follow
fain
within
the
pillar
of
the
hall
vii
the
was
follow
by
a
band
of
men
all
clad
like
rovers
of
the
sea
and
brown
were
they
as
is
the
desert
sand
loud
in
their
mirth
and
of
their
bearing
free
and
gifts
they
bore
from
the
deep
treasury
and
forests
of
some
eastern
lord
vases
of
gold
and
bronze
and
ivory
that
might
the
pythian
fane
have
viii
now
when
the
king
had
greeted
diocles
and
him
that
seem
his
guest
the
twain
were
led
to
the
dim
polish
baths
where
for
their
ease
cool
water
their
lustrous
limbs
was
shed
with
oil
anointed
was
each
goodly
head
by
asteris
and
phylo
fair
of
face
next
like
two
gods
for
loveliness
they
sped
to
menelaus
in
the
ix
there
were
they
seated
at
the
king
right
hand
and
maidens
bare
them
bread
and
meat
and
wine
within
that
fair
hall
of
the
argive
land
whose
doors
and
roof
with
gold
and
silver
shine
as
doth
the
of
zeus
divine
and
helen
came
from
forth
her
fragrant
bower
the
fairest
lady
of
immortal
line
like
morning
when
the
rosy
dawn
doth
flower
adraste
set
for
her
a
shining
chair
of
and
ivory
and
beautiful
alcippe
led
the
fair
the
child
hermione
a
little
maiden
of
long
summers
three
her
head
on
helen
breast
she
laid
and
peep
out
at
the
strangers
wistfully
as
is
the
wont
of
children
half
afraid
xi
now
when
desire
of
meat
and
drink
was
done
and
ended
was
the
joy
of
minstrelsy
queen
helen
spake
beholding
how
the
sun
within
the
heaven
of
bronze
was
riding
high
truly
my
friends
methinks
the
hour
is
nigh
when
men
may
crave
to
know
what
need
doth
bring
to
lacedaemon
wet
ways
and
dry
this
prince
that
bears
the
sceptre
of
a
king
xii
yea
or
perchance
a
god
is
he
for
still
the
great
gods
wander
on
our
mortal
ways
and
watch
their
altars
upon
mead
or
hill
and
taste
our
sacrifice
and
hear
our
lays
and
now
perchance
will
heed
if
any
prays
and
now
will
vex
us
with
unkind
control
but
anywise
must
man
live
out
his
days
for
fate
hath
given
him
an
enduring
soul
xiii
then
tell
us
prithee
all
that
may
be
told
and
if
thou
art
a
mortal
joy
be
thine
and
if
thou
art
a
god
then
rich
with
gold
thine
altar
in
our
palace
court
shall
shine
with
roses
garlanded
and
wet
with
wine
and
we
shall
praise
thee
with
unceasing
breath
ah
then
be
gentle
as
thou
art
divine
and
bring
not
on
us
baneful
love
or
death
xiv
then
spake
the
stranger
as
when
to
a
maid
a
young
man
speaks
his
voice
was
soft
and
low
alas
no
god
am
i
be
not
afraid
for
even
now
the
nodding
daisies
grow
whose
seed
above
my
grassy
cairn
shall
blow
when
i
am
nothing
but
a
drift
of
white
dust
in
a
cruse
of
gold
and
nothing
know
but
darkness
and
immeasurable
night
xv
the
dawn
or
noon
or
twilight
draweth
near
when
one
shall
smite
me
on
the
bridge
of
war
or
with
the
ruthless
sword
or
with
the
spear
or
with
the
bitter
arrow
flying
far
but
as
a
man
heart
so
his
good
days
are
that
zeus
the
lord
of
thunder
giveth
him
wherefore
i
follow
fortune
like
a
star
may
wait
me
in
the
distance
dim
xvi
now
all
men
call
me
paris
priam
son
who
widely
rules
a
peaceful
folk
and
still
nay
though
ye
dwell
afar
off
there
is
none
but
hears
of
ilios
on
the
windy
hill
and
of
the
plain
that
the
two
rivers
fill
with
murmuring
sweet
streams
the
whole
year
long
and
walls
the
gods
have
wrought
with
wondrous
skill
where
cometh
never
man
to
do
us
wrong
xvii
wherefore
i
sail
not
here
for
help
in
war
though
well
the
argives
in
such
need
can
aid
the
force
that
comes
on
me
is
other
far
one
that
on
all
men
comes
i
seek
the
maid
whom
golden
aphrodite
shall
persuade
to
lay
her
hand
in
mine
and
follow
me
to
my
white
halls
within
the
cedar
shade
beyond
the
waters
of
the
barren
sea
xviii
then
at
the
goddess
name
grew
helen
pale
like
golden
stars
that
flicker
in
the
dawn
or
like
a
child
that
hears
a
dreadful
tale
or
like
the
roses
on
a
rich
man
lawn
when
now
the
suns
of
summer
are
withdrawn
and
the
loose
leaves
with
a
sad
wind
are
stirr
till
the
wet
grass
is
strewn
with
petals
wan
so
paled
the
golden
helen
at
his
word
xix
but
swift
the
rose
into
her
cheek
and
for
a
little
moment
like
a
flame
the
perfect
face
of
argive
helen
burn
as
doth
a
woman
when
some
spoken
name
brings
back
to
mind
some
ancient
love
or
shame
but
none
save
paris
mark
the
thing
who
said
my
tale
no
more
must
weary
this
fair
dame
with
telling
why
i
wander
all
unwed
xx
but
helen
bending
on
him
gracious
brows
besought
him
for
the
story
of
his
quest
for
sultry
is
the
summer
that
allows
to
mortal
men
no
sweeter
boon
than
rest
and
surely
such
a
tale
as
thine
is
best
to
make
the
hours
go
by
till
sinks
the
sun
in
darkness
and
the
west
and
soft
stars
lead
the
night
along
the
sky
xxi
then
at
the
word
of
helen
paris
spoke
my
tale
is
shorter
than
a
summer
day
my
mother
ere
i
saw
the
light
awoke
at
dawn
in
ilios
shrieking
in
dismay
who
dream
that
her
feet
there
fell
and
lay
a
flaming
brand
that
utterly
burn
down
to
dust
of
crumbling
ashes
red
and
grey
the
coronal
of
towers
and
all
troy
town
xxii
then
the
interpretation
of
this
dream
my
father
sought
at
many
priestly
hands
where
the
white
temple
doth
in
pytho
gleam
and
at
the
fane
of
ammon
in
the
sands
and
where
the
oak
tree
of
dodona
stands
with
boughs
oracular
against
the
sky
and
with
one
voice
the
gods
from
all
the
lands
cried
out
child
must
die
the
child
must
die
xxiii
then
was
i
born
to
sorrow
and
in
fear
the
dark
priest
took
me
from
my
sire
and
bore
a
wailing
child
through
beech
and
pinewood
drear
up
to
the
knees
of
ida
and
the
hoar
rocks
whence
a
fountain
breaketh
evermore
and
leaps
with
shining
waters
to
the
sea
through
black
and
pools
without
a
shore
and
there
they
deem
they
took
farewell
of
me
xxiv
but
round
my
neck
they
tied
a
golden
ring
that
fell
from
ganymedes
when
he
high
over
ida
on
the
eagle
wing
to
dwell
for
ever
with
the
gods
adored
to
be
the
beside
the
board
of
zeus
and
kneel
at
the
eternal
throne
a
jewel
was
from
old
king
tros
hoard
that
ruled
in
ilios
ages
long
agone
xxv
and
there
they
left
me
in
that
dell
untrod
shepherd
nor
huntsman
ever
wanders
there
for
dread
of
pan
that
is
a
jealous
god
yea
and
the
ladies
of
the
streams
forbear
the
naiad
nymphs
to
weave
their
dances
fair
or
twine
their
yellow
tresses
with
the
shy
fronds
of
and
there
had
the
priests
appointed
me
to
die
xxvi
but
vainly
doth
a
man
contend
with
fate
my
father
had
less
pity
on
his
son
than
wild
things
of
the
woodland
desolate
is
said
that
ere
the
autumn
day
was
done
a
great
that
in
these
rocks
did
wonn
beheld
a
sleeping
babe
she
did
convey
down
to
a
den
beheld
not
of
the
sun
the
cavern
where
her
own
soft
litter
lay
xxvii
and
therein
was
i
nurtured
wondrously
so
rumour
saith
i
know
not
of
these
things
for
mortal
men
are
ever
wont
to
lie
they
speak
of
kings
i
tell
what
i
was
told
for
memory
brings
no
record
of
those
days
that
are
as
deep
lost
as
the
lullaby
a
mother
sings
in
ears
of
children
that
are
fallen
on
sleep
xxviii
men
say
that
now
five
autumn
days
had
pass
when
agelaus
following
a
hurt
deer
trod
soft
on
crackling
acorns
and
the
mast
that
lay
beneath
the
oak
and
sere
in
dread
lest
angry
pan
were
sleeping
near
then
heard
a
cry
from
forth
a
cavern
grey
and
peeping
round
the
fallen
rocks
in
fear
beheld
where
in
the
wild
beast
tracks
i
lay
xxix
so
agelaus
bore
me
from
the
wild
down
to
his
hut
and
with
his
children
i
was
nurtured
being
as
was
deem
the
child
of
hermes
or
some
mountain
deity
for
these
with
the
wild
nymphs
are
wont
to
lie
within
the
holy
caverns
where
the
bee
can
scarcely
find
a
darkling
path
to
fly
through
veils
of
bracken
and
the
xxx
so
with
the
shepherds
on
the
hills
i
stray
and
drave
the
kine
to
feed
where
rivers
run
and
play
upon
the
in
the
shade
and
scarcely
knew
my
manhood
was
begun
the
pleasant
years
still
passing
one
by
one
till
i
was
chiefest
of
the
mountain
men
and
clomb
the
peaks
that
take
the
snow
and
sun
and
braved
the
anger
lion
in
his
den
xxxi
now
in
my
herd
of
kine
was
one
more
dear
by
far
than
all
the
rest
and
fairer
far
a
milkwhite
bull
the
captive
of
my
spear
and
all
the
wondering
shepherds
called
him
and
still
he
led
his
fellows
to
the
war
when
the
lean
wolves
against
the
herds
came
down
then
would
he
charge
and
drive
their
hosts
afar
beyond
the
pastures
to
the
forests
brown
xxxii
now
so
it
chanced
that
on
an
autumn
morn
king
priam
sought
a
goodly
bull
to
slay
in
memory
of
his
child
no
sooner
born
than
midst
the
lonely
mountains
cast
away
to
die
ere
scarce
he
had
beheld
the
day
and
priam
men
came
wandering
afar
to
that
green
pool
where
by
the
flocks
i
lay
and
straight
they
coveted
the
goodly
xxxiii
and
drave
him
no
word
spoken
to
the
town
one
man
mine
arrow
lit
on
and
he
fell
his
comrades
held
me
off
and
down
and
down
through
golden
windings
of
the
autumn
dell
they
spurr
along
the
beast
that
loved
me
well
till
red
were
his
white
sides
i
following
wrath
in
my
heart
their
evil
deeds
to
tell
in
ilios
at
the
footstool
of
the
king
xxxiv
but
ere
they
came
to
the
wall
they
spied
a
meadow
by
the
and
there
the
men
of
troy
were
gathered
all
for
joust
and
play
and
priam
sons
defied
all
other
men
in
all
maeonia
wide
to
strive
with
them
in
boxing
and
in
speed
victorious
with
the
shepherds
had
i
vied
so
boldly
followed
to
that
flowery
mead
xxxv
maeonia
phrygia
troia
there
were
met
and
there
the
king
child
of
laomedon
rich
prizes
for
the
vanquishers
had
set
damsels
and
robes
and
cups
that
like
the
sun
shone
but
the
white
bull
was
the
chiefest
one
and
him
the
victor
in
the
games
should
slay
to
zeus
the
king
of
gods
when
all
was
done
and
so
with
sacrifice
should
crown
the
day
xxxvi
now
it
were
over
long
methinks
to
tell
the
contest
of
the
heady
charioteers
of
them
the
goal
that
turn
and
them
that
fell
but
i
outran
the
young
men
of
my
years
and
with
the
bow
did
i
my
peers
and
wrestling
and
in
boxing
i
strove
with
hector
of
the
ashen
spears
yea
till
the
heralds
bade
us
hold
xxxvii
then
priam
hail
me
winner
of
the
day
mine
were
the
maid
the
cup
and
chiefest
prize
mine
own
fair
milkwhite
bull
was
mine
to
slay
but
then
the
murmurs
wax
to
angry
cries
and
hard
men
set
on
me
in
deadly
wise
my
brethren
though
they
knew
it
not
i
turn
and
fled
unto
the
place
of
sacrifice
where
altars
to
the
god
of
strangers
burn
xxxviii
at
mine
own
funeral
feast
had
i
been
slain
but
fearing
zeus
they
halted
for
a
space
and
lo
apollo
priestess
with
a
train
of
holy
maidens
came
into
that
place
and
far
did
she
outshine
the
rest
in
grace
but
in
her
eyes
such
dread
was
frozen
then
as
glares
eternal
from
the
gorgon
face
wherewith
athene
quells
the
ranks
of
men
xxxix
she
was
old
priam
daughter
long
ago
apollo
loved
her
and
did
not
deny
his
gifts
the
things
that
are
to
be
to
know
the
tongue
of
that
can
not
lie
and
knowledge
gave
he
of
all
birds
that
fly

saith

she
when
her
dark
eyes
fell
on
me
did
stand
at
gaze
a
while
with
wan
lips
murmuring
and
then
came
nigh
to
me
and
took
my
hand
and
led
me
to
the
footstool
of
the
king
and
call
me
and
drew
forth
the
ring
that
men
had
found
upon
me
in
the
wild
for
still
i
bore
it
as
a
precious
thing

token
of
a

she
made
answer

king
thy
fate
that
comes
to
all

come
on
thee

thine

lost

then
the
king
bare
me
to
his
lofty
hall

there
we
feasted
in
much
love
and
mirth

priam
to
the
mountain

for

my
new

grown
a
common

pleasant
years

passing

deep
in
ida
was
i
wandering
the
glare
of
ilios
to
shun
in
summer

the
day
was
wholly
done

i
beheld
a
goodly
prince
the
hair
to
bloom
upon
his
lip

scarce
begun
the
season
when
the
flower
of
youth
is
fair

i
hermes
by
his
golden
wand
wherewith
he
lulls
the
eyes
of

to
sleep

nodding
with
his
brows
he
bade
me
stand
and
spake
thou
hast
a
tryst
to
keep
with
goddesses
within
the
forest
deep

paris
lovely
things

thou
behold
more
fair

within
the
forest

do
aphrodite

meet

hera
who
to
thee
shall
bare
each
limb
each
grace
from
golden
head
to
ivory
feet

thee
fair
shepherd

they
entreat
as
thou
men
art
beauteous

declare
which
queen
of
queens
immortal
is
most
sweet
and
doth
deserve
the
meed
of
the
most
fair
xlvi
late
between
them
rose
a
bitter
strife
in
peleus
halls
upon
his
wedding
day
when
peleus
took
him
an
immortal
wife
and
there
was
bidden
all
the
god
array
save
discord
only
yet
she
brought
dismay
and
cast
an
apple
on
the
bridal
board
with
let
the
fairest
bear
the
prize
away
deep
on
its
golden
rind
and
gleaming
scored

in
the
sudden
night

the
sun
in
tethys
silver
arms
hath
slept
an
hour
shalt
thou
be
had
into
the
forest
dun

brought
unto
a
dark
enchanted
bower

there
of
goddesses
behold
the
flower
with
very
beauty
burning
in
the
night

these
will
offer
wisdom

thou
wise

choose
aright
xlviii
he
spake
and
pass
and
night
without
a
breath
without
a
star
drew
on
and
now
i
heard
the
voice
that
in
the
springtime
wandereth
the
crying
of
dame
hera
shadowy
bird
and
soon
the
silence
of
the
trees
was
stirred
by
the
wise
fowl
of
pallas
and
anigh
more
sweet
than
is
a
girl
first
loving
word
the
doves
of
aphrodite
made
reply
xlix
these
voices
did
i
follow
through
the
trees
threading
the
coppice
a
starless
sky
when
lo
the
very
queen
of
goddesses
in
golden
beauty
gleaming
wondrously
even
she
that
hath
the
heaven
for
canopy
and
in
the
arms
of
mighty
zeus
doth
sleep
and
then
for
dread
methought
that
i
must
die
but
hera
called
me
with
soft
voice
and
deep
give
me
the
prize
and
thou
shalt
reign
many
lordly
peoples
far
and
wide
from
them
that
till
the
black
and
crumbling
plain
where
the
sweet
waters
of
aegyptus
glide
to
those
that
on
the
northern
marches
ride
and
the
ceteians
and
the
blameless
men
that
round
the
of
morn
abide
and
all
the
dwellers
in
the
asian
fen

i
will
love
fair
ilios
as
i
love
argos
and
rich
mycenae
that
doth
hoard
deep
wealth

i
will
make
thee
king
above
a
hundred
peoples
men
shall
call
thee
lord
in
tongues
thou
not
thou
shalt
be
adored
with
sacrifice
as
are
the
gods
divine
if
only
thou
wilt
speak
a
little
word
and
say
the
prize
of
loveliness
is
mine

then
as
i
doubted
like
a
sudden
flame
of
silver
came
athene
and
methought
beholding
her
how
stately
as
she
came
that
dim
wood
to
a
fragrant
fane
was
wrought
so
pure
the
warlike
maiden
seem
that
nought
but
her
own
voice
commanding
made
me
raise
mine
eyes
to
see
her
beauty
who
besought
in
briefest
words
the
guerdon
of
all
praise
liii
she
spake
wealth
nor
crowns
are
in
my
gift
but
wisdom
but
the
eyes
that
glance
afar
but
courage
and
the
spirit
that
is
swift
to
cleave
her
path
through
all
the
waves
of
war
endurance
that
the
fates
can
never
mar
these
and
my
loving
friendship
these
are
thine
and
these
shall
guide
thee
steadfast
as
a
star

thou
hast
eyes
to
know
the
prize
is
mine

last
in
a
lovely
mist
of
rosy
fire
came
aphrodite
through
the
forest
glade
the
queen
of
all
delight
and
all
desire
more
fair
than
when
her
naked
foot
she
laid
on
the
blind
mere
wild
wave
that
sank
dismay
what
time
the
sea
grew
smoother
than
a
lake
i
was
too
happy
to
be
sore
afraid
and
like
a
song
her
voice
was
when
she
spake
lv
paris
what
is
power
tantalus
and
sisyphus
were
kings
long
time
ago
but
now
they
lie
in
the
lake
dolorous
the
hills

noisy
with
their
woe
ay
swift
the
tides
of
empire
ebb
and
flow
and
that
is
quickly
lost
was
hardly
won
as
ilios
herself
did
know
when
high
walls
help
not
king
laomedon
lvi
what
are
strength
and
courage
for
the
child
of
mighty
zeus
the
strong
man
herakles
knew
many
days

evil
ere

piled
the

all

cease

thee
beyond
the
brine

the
currents

the
fairest
woman
in

is
thine
lvii
she
spake
and
touched
the
prize
and
all
grew
dim
i
heard
no
voice
of
anger
deity
but
round
me
did
the
night
air
swoon
and
swim
and
when
i
waken
lo
the
sun
was
high
and
in
that
place
accursed
did
i
lie
where
agelaus
found
the
naked
child
then
with
swift
foot
i
did
arise
and
fly
forth
from
the
deeps
of
that
enchanted
wild
lviii
and
down
i
sped
to
ilios
down
the
dell
where
years
agone
the
white
bull
guided
me
and
through
green
boughs
beheld
where
foam
and
fell
the
merry
waters
of
the
western
sea
of
love
the
sweet
birds
sang
from
sky
and
tree
and
swift
i
reach
the
haven
and
the
shore
and
call
my
mariners
and
follow
free
where
love
might
lead
across
the
waters
hoar
lix
three
days
with
fair
winds
ran
we
then
we
drave
before
the
north
that
made
the
long
waves
swell
round
malea
but
hardly
from
the
wave
we
at
pylos
nestor
citadel
and
there
the
son
of
neleus
loved
us
well
and
brought
us
to
the
high
prince
diocles
who
led
us
hither
and
it
thus
befell
that
here
below
thy
roof
we
sit
at
ease
lx
then
all
men
gave
the
stranger
thanks
and
praise
and
menelaus
for
red
wine
bade
call
and
the
sun
fell
and
dark
were
all
the
ways
then
maidens
set
forth
braziers
in
the
hall
and
heap
them
high
with
lighted
brands
withal
but
helen
pass
as
doth
the
fading
day
pass
from
the
world
and
softly
left
them
all
loud
their
wine
amid
the
twilight
grey
lxi
so
night
drew
on
with
rain
nor
yet
they
ceased
within
the
hall
to
drink
the
gleaming
wine

late
they
pour
the
last
cup
of
the
feast
to
the
messenger
divine
and
last
torches
tall
that
smoke
and
shine
the
maidens
strew
the
beds
with

might
recline
all

beneath
the
echoing
corridor
book
ii
the
spell
of
aphrodite
the
coming
of
aphrodite
and
how
she
told
helen
that
she
must
depart
in
company
with
paris
but
promised
withal
that
helen
having
fallen
into
a
deep
sleep
should
awake
forgetful
of
her
old
life
and
ignorant
of
her
shame
and
blameless
of
those
evil
deeds
that
the
goddess
thrust
upon
her
i
now
in
the
upper
chamber
the
gate
lay
menelaus
on
his
carven
bed
and
swift
and
sudden
as
the
stroke
of
fate
a
deep
sleep
fell
upon
his
weary
head
but
the
god
with
wand
of
lead
came
not
near
helen
wistful
did
she
lie
till
dark
should
change
to
grey
and
grey
to
red
and
golden
throned
morn
sweep
the
sky
ii
slow
pass
the
heavy
night
like
one
who
fears
the
step
of
murder
she
lies
quivering
if
any
cry
of
the
night
bird
she
hears
and
strains
her
eyes
to
mark
some
dreadful
thing
if
but
the
curtains
of
the
window
swing
stirr
by
the
breath
of
night
and
still
she
wept
as
she
were
not
the
daughter
of
a
king
and
no
strong
king
her
lord
beside
her
slept
iii
now
in
that
hour
the
folk
who
watch
the
night
shepherds
and
fishermen
and
they
that
ply
strange
arts
and
seek
their
spells
in
the
beheld
a
marvel
in
the
sea
and
sky
for
all
the
waves
of
all
the
seas
that
sigh
between
the
straits
of
helle
and
the
nile
flush
with
a
flame
of
silver
suddenly
from
soft
cythera
to
the
cyprian
isle
iv
and
hesperus
the
kindest
star
of
heaven
that
bringeth
all
things
good
wax
pale
and
straight
there
fell
a
flash
of
white
malignant
levin
among
the
gleaming
waters
desolate
the
lights
of
sea
and
sky
did
mix
and
mate
and
change
to
rosy
flame
and
thence
did
fly
the
lovely
queen
of
love
that
turns
to
hate
like
summer
lightnings
the
sea
and
sky
and
now
the
bower
of
helen
fill
with
light
and
now
she
knew
the
thing
that
she
did
fear
was
close
upon
her
for
the
black
of
night
doth
burn
like
fire
the
gods
are
near
then
shone
like
flame
each
helm
and
shield
and
spear
that
hung
within
the
chamber
of
the
king
but
he
though
all
the
bower
as
day
was
clear
slept
as
they
sleep
that
know
no
wakening
vi
but
helen
leap
from
her
fair
carven
bed
as
some
tormented
thing
that
fear
makes
bold
and
on
the
ground
she
beat
her
golden
head
and
pray
with
bitter
moanings
manifold
yet
knew
that
she
could
never
move
the
cold
heart
of
the
lovely
goddess
standing
there
her
feet
upon
a
little
cloud
a
fold
of
silver
cloud
about
her
bosom
bare
vii
so
stood
queen
aphrodite
as
she
stands
unmoved
in
her
bright
mansion
when
in
vain
some
naked
maiden
stretches
helpless
hands
and
shifts
the
magic
wheel
and
burns
the
grain
and
can
not
win
her
lover
back
again
nor
her
old
heart
of
quiet
any
more
where
moonlight
floods
the
dim
sicilian
main
and
the
cool
wavelets
break
along
the
shore
viii
then
helen
ceased
from
unavailing
prayer
and
rose
and
faced
the
goddess
steadily
till
even
the
lady
fair
half
shrank
before
the
anger
of
her
eye
and
helen
cried
with
an
exceeding
cry
why
does
zeus
live
if
we
indeed
must
be
no
more
than
sullen
spoils
of
destiny
and
slaves
of
an
adulteress
like
thee
ix
what
wilt
thou
with
me
mistress
of
all
woe
say
wilt
thou
bear
me
to
another
land
where
thou
hast
other
lovers
rise
and
go
where
dark
the
pine
trees
upon
ida
stand
for

did
one
unloose
thy
girdle

seek
the
forest
where

bled

on

yellow
sand

thou
with
me

endure
whose
soul
for
all
thy
craft

behold
my
heart
is
purer
than

plume
upon
the
stainless
pinions
of
the
swan
and
thou
wilt
smirch
and
stain
it
with
the
fume
of
all
thy
hateful
lusts
idalian
my
name
shall
be
a
hissing
that
a
man
shall
smile
to
speak

curse
and
hate

on
my
little
child
shall
come
a
ban
and
all
my
lofty
home
be
desolate
xii
is
it
thy
will
that
like
a
golden
cup
from
lip
to
lip
of
heroes
i
must
go
and
be
but
as
a
banner
lifted
up
to
beckon

winds

may
blow
have
i
not
seen
fair
athens
in
her
woe
and
all

homes
aflame
from

to

my
fierce
brothers
wrought
her
overthrow

carried
me
xiii
me
in
my
bloomless
youth
a
maiden
child
from

pure
altars

her
fane
and
bare
me
with
pirithous
the

a

purify
the
stain

then
helen
ceased
her
passion
like
a
flame
that
slays
the
thing
it
lives
by
blazed
and
fell
as
faint
as
waves
at
dawn

fierce
they
came
by
night
to
storm
some
rocky
citadel

with

the

mar
its
towery
crown
xix
and
of
thine
end
i
speak
not
but
thy
name
thy
name
which
thou
lamentest
that
shall
be
a
song
in
all
men
speech
a
tongue
of
flame
between
the
burning
lips
of
poesy
and
the
nine
daughters
of
mnemosyne
with
prince
apollo
leader
of
the
nine
shall
make
thee
deathless
in
their
minstrelsy
yea
for
thou
shalt
outlive
the
race
divine
xx
the
race
of
gods
for
like
the
sons
of
men
we
gods
have
but
our
season
and
go
by
and
cronos
pass
and
uranus
and
then
shall
zeus
and
all
his
children
utterly
pass
and
new
gods
be
born
and
reign
and
die
but
thee
shall
lovers
worship
evermore
what
gods
usurp
the
changeful
sky
or
flit
to
the
irremeable
shore
xxi
now
sleep
and
dream
not
sleep
the
long
day
through
and
the
brief
watches
of
the
summer
night
and
then
go
forth
amid
the
flowers
and
dew
where
the
red
rose
of
dawn
outburns
the
white
then
shalt
thou
learn
my
mercy
and
my
might
between
the
drowsy
lily
and
the
rose
there
shalt
thou
spell
the
meaning
of
delight
and
know
such
gladness
as
a
goddess
knows
xxii
then
sleep
came
floating
from
the
lemnian
isle
and
over
helen
crush
his
poppy
crown
her
soft
lids
waver
for
a
little
while
then
on
her
carven
bed
she
laid
her
down
and
sleep
the
comforter
of
king
and
clown
kind
sleep
the
sweetest
near
akin
to
death
held
her
as
close
as
death
doth
men
that
drown
so
close
that
none
might
hear
her
inward
breath
xxiii
so
close
no
man
might
tell
she
was
not
dead
and
then
the
goddess
took
her
zone
where
lies
all
her
enchantment
love
and
lustihead
and
the
glad
converse
that
beguiles
the
wise
and
grace
the
very
gods
may
not
despise
and
sweet
desire
that
doth
the
whole
world
move
and
therewith
touch
she
helen
sleeping
eyes
and
made
her
lovely
as
the
queen
of
love
xxiv
then
aphrodite
went
to
far
idalia
over
land
and
sea
and
scarce
the
fragrant
bent
beneath
her
footsteps
faring
daintily
and
in
idalia
the
graces
three
anointed
her
with
oil
ambrosial
so
to
her
house
in
sidon
wended
she
to
mock
the
prayers
of
lovers
when
they
call
xxv
and
all
day
long
the
incense
and
the
smoke
lifted
and
fell
and
soft
and
slowly
roll
and
many
a
hymn
and
musical
awoke
between
the
pillars
of
her
house
of
gold
and
girls
and
fair
boys
did
sacrifice
her
fragrant
courts
within
and
in
dark
chapels
wrought
rites
manifold
the
loving
favour
of
the
queen
to
win
xxvi
but
menelaus
waking
suddenly
beheld
the
dawn
was
white
the
day
was
near
and
rose
and
kiss
fair
helen
no
he
spake
and
never
mark
a
fallen
tear
men
know
not
when
they
part
for
many
a
year
he
grasp
a
lance
in
either
hand
and
merrily
went
forth
to
drive
the
deer
with
paris
through
the
dewy
morning
land
xxvii
so
up
the
steep
sides
of
taygetus
they
fared
and
to
the
windy
hollows
came
while
from
the
streams
of
deep
oceanus
the
sun
arose
and
on
the
fields
did
flame
and
through
wet
glades
the
huntsmen
drave
the
game
and
with
them
paris
sway
an
ashen
spear
heavy
and
long
and
shod
with
bronze
to
tame
the
goats
and
forest
deer
xxviii
now
in
a
copse
a
mighty
boar
there
lay
for
through
the
boughs
the
wet
winds
never
blew
nor
lit
the
bright
sun
on
it
with
his
ray
nor
rain
might
pierce
the
woven
branches
through
but
leaves
had
fallen
deep
the
lair
to
strew
then
questing
of
the
hounds
and
men
aroused
the
boar
and
forth
he
sprang
to
view
with
eyes
that
burn
at
bay
before
them
all
xxix
then
paris
was
the
first
to
rush
on
him
with
spear
aloft
in
his
strong
hand
to
smite
and
through
the
monster
pierced
the
point
and
dim
the
flame
fell
in
his
eyes
and
all
his
might
with
his
last
cry
went
forth
forgetting
fight
forgetting
strength
he
fell
and
gladly
then
they
gather
round
and
dealt
with
him
aright
then
left
his
body
with
the
serving
men
xxx
now
birds
were
long
awake
that
with
their
cry
were
wont
to
waken
helen
and
the
dew
where
fell
the
sun
upon
the
lawn
was
dry
and
all
the
summer
land
was
glad
anew
and
maidens
footsteps
rang
the
palace
through
and
with
their
footsteps
chimed
their
happy
song
and
one
to
other
cried
a
marvel
new
that
sleep
hath
held
the
queen
so
long
xxxi
then
phylo
brought
the
child
hermione
and
close
unto
her
mother
side
she
crept
and
her
beauty
tumbled
she
chiding
her
sweetly
that
so
late
she
slept
and
babbling
still
a
merry
coil
she
kept
but
like
a
woman
stiff
beneath
her
shroud
lay
helen
till
the
young
child
fear
and
wept
and
ran
and
to
her
nurses
cried
aloud
xxxii
then
came
the
women
quickly
and
in
dread
gather
round
helen
but
might
naught
avail
to
wake
her
moveless
as
a
maiden
dead
that
artemis
hath
slain
yet
nowise
pale
she
lay
but
aethra
did
begin
the
wail
and
all
the
women
with
sad
voice
replied
who
deem
her
pass
unto
the
poplar
vale
wherein
doth
dread
persephone
abide
xxxiii
ah
slowly
pass
the
miserable
day
in
the
rich
house
that
late
was
full
of
pride
then
the
sun
fell
and
all
the
paths
were
grey
and
menelaus
from
the
came
and
through
palace
doors
all
open
wide
rang
the
wild
dirge
that
told
him
of
the
thing
that
helen
that
the
queen
had
strangely
died
then
on
his
threshold
fell
he
grovelling
xxxiv
and
cast
the
dust
upon
his
yellow
hair
and
but
that
paris
leap
and
held
his
hand
his
hunter
knife
would
he
have
clutch
and
there
had
slain
himself
to
follow
to
that
land
where
flit
the
ghosts
of
men
a
shadowy
band
that
have
no
more
delight
no
more
desire
when
once
the
flesh
hath
burn
down
like
a
brand
drench
by
the
dark
wine
on
the
funeral
pyre
xxxv
so
on
the
ashen
threshold
lay
the
king
and
all
within
the
house
was
chill
and
drear
the
women
watchers
gather
in
a
ring
about
the
bed
of
helen
and
her
bier
and
much
had
they
to
tell
and
much
to
hear
of
happy
queens
and
fair
untimely
dead
such
joy
they
took
amid
their
evil
cheer
while
the
low
thunder
muttered
overhead
book
iii
the
flight
of
helen
the
flight
of
helen
and
paris
from
lacedaemon
and
of
what
things
befell
them
in
their
voyaging
and
how
they
came
to
troy
i
the
grey
dawn
daughter
rosy
morn
awoke
in
old
tithonus
arms
and
suddenly
let
harness
her
swift
steeds
beneath
the
yoke
and
drave
her
shining
chariot
through
the
sky
then
men
might
see
the
flocks
of
thunder
fly
all
gold
and
rose
the
azure
pastures
through
what
time
the
lark
was
carolling
on
high
above
the
gardens
drench
with
rainy
dew
ii
but
aphrodite
sent
a
slumber
deep
on
all
in
the
king
palace
young
and
old
and
one
by
one
the
women
fell
asleep
their
lamentable
tales
left
half
untold
before
the
dawn
when
folk
wax
weak
and
cold
but
helen
waken
with
the
shining
morn
forgetting
quite
her
sorrows
manifold
and
light
of
heart
as
was
the
day
iii
she
had
no
memory
of
unhappy
things
she
knew
not
of
the
evil
days
to
come
forgotten
were
her
ancient
wanderings
and
as
lethaean
waters
wholly
numb
the
sense
of
spirits
in
elysium
that
no
remembrance
may
their
bliss
alloy
even
so
the
rumour
of
her
days
was
dumb
and
all
her
heart
was
ready
for
new
joy
iv
the
young
day
knows
not
of
an
elder
dawn
joys
of
old
noons
old
sorrows
of
the
night
and
so
from
helen
was
the
past
withdrawn
her
lord
her
child
her
home
forgotten
quite
lost
in
the
marvel
of
a
new
delight
she
was
as
one
who
knows
he
shall
not
die
when
earthly
colours
melt
into
the
bright
pure
splendour
of
his
immortality
then
helen
rose
and
all
her
body
fair
she
bath
in
the
spring
water
pure
and
cold
and
with
her
hand
bound
up
her
shining
hair
and
clothed
her
in
the
raiment
that
of
old
athene
wrought
with
marvels
manifold
a
bridal
gift
from
an
immortal
hand
and
all
the
front
was
clasp
with
clasps
of
gold
and
for
the
girdle
was
a
golden
band
vi
next
from
her
upper
chamber
silently
went
helen
moving
like
a
morning
dream
she
did
not
know
the
golden
roof
the
high
walls
and
the
shields
that
on
the
pillars
gleam
only
she
heard
the
murmur
of
the
stream
that
waters
all
the
garden
wide
expanse
this
song
and
cry
of
singing
birds
did
seem
to
guide
her
feet
as
music
guides
the
dance
vii
the
music
drew
her
on
to
the
glad
air
from
forth
the
chamber
of
enchanted
death
and
lo
the
world
was
waking
everywhere
the
wind
went
by
a
cool
delicious
breath
like
that
which
in
the
gardens
wandereth
the
golden
gardens
of
the
hesperides
and
in
its
song
unheard
of
things
it
saith
the
myriad
marvels
of
the
fairy
seas
viii
so
through
the
courtyard
to
the
garden
close
went
helen
where
she
heard
the
murmuring
of
water
the
lily
and
the
rose
for
thereby
doth
a
double
fountain
spring
to
one
stream
do
the
women
pitchers
bring
by
menelaus
gates
at
close
of
day
the
other
through
the
close
doth
shine
and
sing
then
to
the
swift
eurotas
fleets
away
ix
and
helen
sat
her
down
upon
the
grass
and
pluck
the
little
daisies
white
and
red
and
toss
them
where
the
running
waters
pass
to
watch
them
racing
from
the
and
whirl
about
where
little
streams
dispread
and
still
with
merry
birds
the
garden
rang
and
in
their
song
they
said
or
so
do
maids
interpret
that
they
sang
x
then
stoop
she
down
and
watch
the
crystal
stream
and
fishes
poising
where
the
waters
ran
and
lo
upon
the
glass
a
golden
gleam
and
purple
as
of
robes
sidonian
then
sudden
turning
she
beheld
a
man
that
knelt
beside
her
as
her
own
face
fair
was
his
and
his
shoulders
for
a
span
fell
the
bright
tresses
of
his
yellow
hair
xi
then
either
look
on
other
with
amaze
as
each
had
seen
a
god
for
no
long
while
they
marvell
but
as
in
the
first
of
days
the
first
of
men
and
maids
did
meet
and
smile
and
aphrodite
did
their
hearts
beguile
so
hands
met
hands
lips
lips
with
no
word
said
were
they
enchanted
that
leafy
aisle
and
silently
were
woo
betroth
and
xii
ah
slowly
did
their
silence
wake
to
words
that
scarce
had
more
of
meaning
than
the
song
pour
forth
of
the
innumerable
birds
that
fill
the
palace
gardens
all
day
long
so
innocent
so
ignorant
of
wrong
was
she
so
happy
each
in
other
eyes
thus
wrought
the
mighty
goddess
that
is
strong
even
to
make
naught
the
wisdom
of
the
wise
xiii
now
in
the
midst
of
that
enchanted
place
right
gladly
had
they
linger
all
day
through
and
fed
their
love
upon
each
other
face
but
aphrodite
had
a
counsel
new
and
silently
to
paris
side
she
drew
in
guise
of
aethra
whispering
that
the
day
pass
on
while
his
ship
waited
and
his
crew
impatient
in
the
narrow
gythian
bay
xiv
for
thither
had
she
brought
them
by
her
skill
but
helen
saw
her
not
nay
who
can
see
a
goddess
come
or
go
against
her
will
then
paris
whisper
come
ah
love
with
me
come
to
a
shore
beyond
the
barren
sea
there
doth
the
bridal
crown
await
thy
head
and
there
shall
all
the
land
be
glad
of
thee
then
like
a
child
she
follow
where
he
led
xv
for
like
a
child
her
gentle
heart
was
glad
so
through
the
courtyard
pass
they
to
the
gate
and
even
there
as
aphrodite
bade
the
steeds
of
paris
and
the
chariots
wait
then
to
the
car
he
led
her
straight
and
grasped
the
shining
whip
and
golden
rein
and
swift
they
drave
until
the
day
was
late
by
clear
eurotas
through
the
fruitful
plain
xvi
but
now
within
the
halls
the
magic
sleep
was
broken
and
men
sought
them
everywhere
yet
aphrodite
cast
a
cloud
so
deep
about
their
chariot
none
might
see
them
there
and
strangely
did
they
hear
the
trumpets
blare
and
noise
of
racing
wheels
yet
saw
they
nought
then
died
the
sounds
upon
the
distant
air
and
safe
they
won
the
haven
that
they
sought
xvii
beneath
a
grassy
cliff
beneath
the
down
where
swift
eurotas
mingles
with
the
sea
there
climb
the
grey
walls
of
a
little
town
the
sleepy
waters
wash
it
languidly
for
tempests
in
that
haven
might
not
be
the
isle
across
the
inlet
guarded
all
and
the
shrill
winds
that
roam
the
ocean
free
broke
and
were
broken
on
the
rocky
wall
xviii
then
paris
did
a
point
of
hunting
blow
nor
yet
the
sound
had
died
upon
the
hill
when
round
the
isle
they
spied
a
scarlet
prow
and
oars
that
flash
into
that
haven
still
the
oarsmen
bending
forward
with
a
will
and
swift
their
black
ship
to
the
they
brought
and
steer
her
in
with
goodly
skill
and
bare
on
board
the
strange
achaean
bride
xix
now
while
the
swift
ship
through
the
waters
clave
all
happy
things
that
in
the
waters
dwell
arose
and
gamboll
on
the
glassy
wave
and
nereus
led
them
with
his
sounding
shell
yea
the
their
dances
weaving
well
in
the
green
water
gave
them
greeting
free
ah
long
light
linger
late
the
darkness
fell
that
night
upon
the
isle
of
cranae
xx
and
hymen
shook
his
fragrant
torch
on
high
till
all
its
waves
of
smoke
and
tongues
of
flame
like
clouds
of
rosy
gold
fulfill
the
sky
and
all
the
nereids
from
the
waters
came
each
maiden
with
a
musical
sweet
name
doris
and
doto
and
amphithoe
and
their
shrill
bridal
song
of
love
and
shame
made
music
in
the
silence
of
the
sea
xxi
for
this
was
like
that
night
of
summer
weather
when
mortal
men
and
maidens
without
fear
and
and
together
do
worship
pan
in
the
long
twilight
clear
and
artemis
this
one
night
spares
the
deer
and
every
cave
and
dell
and
every
grove
is
glad
with
singing
soft
and
happy
cheer
with
laughter
and
with
dalliance
and
with
love
xxii
now
when
the
dawn
arose
to
waken
gods
and
mortals
out
of
sleep
queen
aphrodite
sent
the
wind
that
blows
from
fairy
gardens
of
the
western
deep
the
sails
are
spread
the
oars
of
paris
leap
past
many
a
headland
many
a
haunted
fane
and
merrily
all
from
isle
to
isle
they
sweep
the
wet
ways
across
the
barren
plain
xxiii
by
many
an
island
fort
and
many
a
haven
they
sped
and
many
a
crowded
arsenal
they
saw
the
loves
of
gods
and
men
engraven
on
friezes
of
astarte
temple
wall
they
heard
that
ancient
shepherd
proteus
call
his
flock
from
forth
the
green
and
tumbling
lea
and
saw
white
thetis
with
her
maidens
all
sweep
up
to
high
olympus
from
the
sea
xxiv
they
saw
the
vain
and
weary
toil
of
men
the
ships
that
win
the
rich
man
all
he
craves
they
pass
the
barks
egyptian
and
heard
afar
the
moaning
of
the
slaves
pent
in
the
dark
hot
hold
beneath
the
waves
and
scatheless
the
sardanian
fleets
among
they
sail
by
men
that
sow
the
sea
with
graves
bearing
black
fate
to
folk
of
alien
tongue
xxv
then
all
day
long
a
rolling
cloud
of
smoke
would
hang
on
the
faint
and
far
but
through
the
night
the
upbroke
from
some
rich
begirt
with
war
and
all
these
things
could
neither
make
nor
mar
the
joy
of
lovers
wandering
but
they
sped
happily
and
heedless
of
the
star
that
hung
their
glad
haven
far
away
xxvi
the
upon
the
height
watch
them
with
vacant
eyes
and
little
knew
they
bore
the
fate
of
troy
to
him
the
bright
plashed
waters
with
the
silver
shining
through
when
tunny
shoals
came
cruising
in
the
blue
was
more
than
love
that
doth
the
world
unmake
and
listless
gazed
he
as
the
gulls
that
flew
and
shriek
and
chatter
in
the
vessel
wake
xxvii
so
the
wind
drave
them
and
the
waters
bare
across
the
great
green
plain
unharvested
till
through
an
they
knew
the
fair
faint
rose
of
snow
on
distant
ida
head
and
swifter
then
the
joyous
oarsmen
sped
but
night
was
ended
and
the
waves
were
fire
beneath
the
fleet
feet
of
a
dawning
red
or
ere
they
won
the
land
of
their
desire
xxviii
now
when
the
folk
about
the
haven
knew
the
scarlet
prow
of
paris
swift
they
ran
and
the
good
ship
within
the
haven
drew
and
merrily
their
welcoming
began
but
none
the
face
of
helen
dared
to
scan
their
bold
eyes
fell
before
they
had
their
fill
for
all
men
deem
her
that
idalian
who
loved
anchises
on
the
lonely
hill
xxix
but
when
her
sweet
smile
and
her
gentleness
and
her
kind
speech
had
won
them
from
dismay
they
changed
their
minds
and
the
gods
to
bless
who
brought
to
ilios
that
happy
day
and
all
the
folk
fair
helen
must
convey
crown
like
a
bride
and
clad
with
pall
through
the
rich
plain
along
the
right
to
the
great
gates
of
the
ilian
wall
xxx
and
through
the
vines
they
pass
where
old
and
young
had
no
more
heed
of
the
glad
vintaging
but
all
unpluck
the
purple
clusters
hung
nor
more
of
linus
did
the
minstrel
sing
for
he
and
all
the
folk
were
following
and
garlanded
in
merry
bands
like
men
when
dionysus
came
as
king
and
led
his
revel
from
the
lands
xxxi
so
from
afar
the
music
and
the
shout
roll
up
to
ilios
and
the
scaean
gate
and
at
the
sound
the
city
folk
came
out
and
bore
sweet
helen
such
a
fairy
weight
as
none
might
deem
the
burden
of
troy
fate
across
the
threshold
of
the
town
and
all
flock
with
her
where
king
priam
sat
in
state
girt
by
his
elders
on
the
ilian
wall
xxxii
no
man
but
knew
him
by
his
crown
of
gold
and
sceptre
and
his
throne
ay
strong
he
seem
as
those
great
kings
of
old
whose
image
is
eternal
on
the
stone
won
from
the
dust
that
once
was
babylon
but
kind
of
mood
was
he
withal
and
mild
and
when
his
eyes
on
argive
helen
shone
he
loved
her
as
a
father
doth
a

round
him
were
set
his

hardly
grey
scarce
touch
as
yet
with

garrulous
as
are
cicalas

sunny
day

might
they
be

years
had
slipp
away

made
them
for
war
or
joy
content
to
watch
the
leaguer
as
it
lay
beside
the
ships
beneath
the
walls
of
troy
xxxiv
then
paris
had
an
easy
tale
to
tell
which
then
might
win
upon
men
ears
who
deem
that
gods
with
mortals
deign
to
dwell
and
that
the
water
of
the
west
enspheres
the
happy
isles
that
know
not
death
nor
tears
yea
and
though
monsters
do
these
islands
guard
yet
men
within
their
coasts
had
dwelt
for
years
uncounted
with
a
strange
love
for
reward
xxxv
and
there
had
paris
ventured
so
said
he
had
known
the
sirens
song
and
circe
wile
and
in
a
cove
of
that
hesperian
sea
had
found
a
maiden
on
a
lonely
isle
a
sacrifice
if
so
men
might
beguile
the
wrath
of
some
they
worshipp
there
but
paris
the
sea
and
strait
defile
had
slain
the
beast
and
won
the
woman
fair
xxxvi
then
while
the
happy
people
cried
well
done
and
priam
heart
was
melted
by
the
tale
for
paris
was
his
son
came
a
wild
woman
with
wet
eyes
and
pale
sad
face
men
look
on
when
she
cast
her
veil
not
gladly
and
none
mark
the
thing
she
said
yet
must
they
hear
her
long
and
boding
wail
that
follow
still
however
fleet
they
fled
xxxvii
she
was
the
priestess
of
apollo
fane
cassandra
and
the
god
of
prophecy
spurr
her
to
speak
and
rent
her
but
in
vain
she
toss
her
wasted
arms
against
the
sky
and
brake
her
golden
circlet
angrily
and
shriek
that
they
had
brought
within
the
gate
serpent
at
their
hearts
to
hell
of
xxxviii
but
ere
the
god
had
left
her
ere
she
fell
and
foam
among
her
maidens
on
the
ground
the
air
was
ringing
with
a
merry
swell
of
flute
and
pipe
and
every
sweetest
sound
in
aphrodite
fane
and
all
around
were
roses
toss
beneath
the
glimmering
green
of
that
high
roof
and
helen
there
was
the
goddess
of
the
trojans
and
their
queen
book
iv
the
death
of
corythus
how
helen
was
made
an
outcast
by
the
trojan
women
and
how
oenone
the
old
love
of
paris
sent
her
son
corythus
to
him
as
her
messenger
and
how
paris
slew
him
unwittingly
and
of
the
curses
of
oenone
and
the
coming
of
the
argive
host
against
troy
i
for
long
in
troia
was
there
peace
and
mirth
the
pleasant
hours
still
passing
one
by
one
and
helen
joy
at
each
fresh
morning
birth
and
almost
wept
at
setting
of
the
sun
for
sorrow
that
the
happy
day
was
done
nor
dream
of
years
when
she
should
hate
the
light
and
mourn
afresh
for
every
day
begun
nor
fare
abroad
save
shamefully
by
night
ii
and
paris
was
not
one
to
backward
cast
a
fearful
glance
nor
pluck
sour
fruits
of
sin
half
ripe
but
seized
all
pleasures
while
they
last
nor
boded
evil
ere
ill
days
begin
nay
nor
lamented
much
when
caught
therein
in
each
adventure
always
finding
joy
and
hopeful
still
through
waves
of
war
to
win
by
strength
of
hector

the

of

iii
now
as
the
storms
drive
white
afar
within
green
upland
glens
to
seek
for
rest
so
rumours
pale
of
an
approaching
war
were
blown
across

beat

when
the

went
down

said
they
would
show
the
leafy

on

a
sacred
in

for

fell
the
tall
and
brown
to
fashion
them
curved

for

still
the
rumour
grew
for

came
old
men
from

bearing
holy
boughs
demanding
great
atonement
for
the
shame
and
sore
despite

house
but
homeward
soon
they
turn
their
scarlet
prows
and
all
their
weary
voyaging
was
vain
for
troy
had
bound
herself
with
awful
vows
to
cleave
to
helen
till
the
walls
were
vi
and
now
like
swallows
ere
the
winter
weather
the
women
in
shrill
groups
were
gathering
with
eager
tongues
still
communing
together
and
many
a
taunt
at
helen
would
they
fling
ay
through
her
innocence
she
felt
the
sting
and
shamed
was
now
her
gentle
face
and
sweet
for
the
children
evil
songs
would
sing
to
mock
her
as
she
hasted
down
the
street
vii
also
the
men
who
worshipp
her
of
old
as
she
had
been
a
goddess
from
above
gazed
at
her
now
with
lustful
eyes
and
bold
as
she
were
naught
but
paris
and
though
in
truth
they
still
were
proud
enough
of
that
fair
gem
in
their
old
city
set
yet
well
she
knew
that
wanton
word
and
scoff
went
round
the
when
the
warriors
met
viii
there
came
a
certain
holiday
when
troy
was
wont
to
send
her
noble
matrons
all
young
wives
and
old
with
clamour
and
with
joy
to
clothe
athene
in
her
temple
hall
and
robe
her
in
a
stately
broider
pall
but
now
they
drove
fair
helen
from
their
train
better
they
scream
to
cast
her
from
the
wall
than
mock
the
gods
with
offerings
in
vain
ix
one
joy
she
had
that
paris
yet
was
true
ay
fickle
paris
true
unto
the
end
and
in
the
court
of
ilios
were
two
kind
hearts
still
eager
helen
to
defend
and
help
and
comfort
in
all
need
to
lend
the
gentle
hector
with
soft
speech
and
mild
and
the
old
king
that
ever
was
her
friend
and
loved
her
as
a
father
doth
his
child
x
these
though
they
knew
not
all
these
blamed
her
not
but
cast
the
heavy
burden
on
the
god
whose
wrath
they
deem
had
verily
waxed
hot
against
the
painful
race
on
earth
that
trod
and
in
god
hand
was
helen
but
the
rod
to
scourge
a
people
that
in
unknown
wise
had
vex
the
far
olympian
abode
with
secret
sin
or
stinted
sacrifice
xi
the
days
grew
into
months
and
months
to
years
and
still
the
argive
army
did
delay
till
folk
in
troia
half
forgot
their
fears
and
almost
as
of
old
were
glad
and
gay
and
men
and
maids
on
ida
dared
to
stray
but
helen
dwelt
within
her
inmost
room
and
there
from
dawning
to
declining
day
wrought
at
the
patient
marvels
of
her
loom
xii
yet
even
there
in
peace
she
might
not
be
there
was
a
nymph
oenone
in
the
hills
the
daughter
of
a
was
she
of
cebren
that
the
mountain
silence
fills
with
murmur
music
for
the
countless
rills
of
ida
meet
him
dancing
to
the
plain
her
paris
wooed
yet
ignorant
of
ills
among
the
shepherd
huts
nor
wooed
in
vain
xiii
nay
summer
often
found
them
by
the
fold
in
these
glad
days
ere
paris
was
a
king
and
oft
the
autumn
in
his
car
of
gold
had
pass
them
merry
at
the
vintaging
and
scarce
they
felt
the
breath
of
the
white
wing
of
winter
in
the
cave
where
they
would
lie
on
beds
of
heather
by
the
fire
till
spring
should
crown
them
with
her
buds
in
passing
by
xiv
for
their
flowery
bed
was
strown
with
fragrant
leaves
and
with
crush
asphodel
and
sweetly
still
the
made
moan
and
many
a
tale
of
love
they
had
to
tell
how
daphnis
loved
the
strange
shy
maiden
well
and
how
she
loved
him
not
and
how
he
died
and
moan
his
dirge
and
blossoms
fell
like
tears
from
lindens
by
the
xv
but
colder
fleeter
than
the
winter
wing
time
pass
and
paris
changed
and
now
no
more
oenone
heard
him
on
the
mountain
sing
not
now
she
met
him
in
the
forest
hoar
nay
but
she
knew
that
on
an
alien
shore
an
alien
love
he
sought
yet
was
she
strong
to
live
who
deem
that
even
as
of
yore
in
days
to
come
might
paris
love
her
long
xvi
for
dark
oenone
from
her
father
drew
a
power
beyond
all
price
the
gift
to
deal
with
wounded
men
though
now
the
dreadful
dew
of
death
anoint
them
and
the
secret
seal
of
fate
be
set
on
them
these
might
she
heal
and
thus
oenone
trusted
still
to
save
her
lover
at
the
point
of
death
and
steal
his
life
from
helen
and
the
amorous
grave
xvii
and
she
had
borne
though
paris
knew
it
not
a
child
fair
corythus
to
be
her
shame
and
still
she
mused
whenas
her
heart
was
hot
he
hath
no
child
by
that
achaean
dame
but
when
her
boy
unto
his
manhood
came
then
sorer
yet
oenone
did
repine
and
bade
him
fare
to
ilios
and
claim
thy
father
love
and
all
that
should
be
thine
xviii
therewith
a
golden
bodkin
from
her
hair
she
drew
and
from
a
birchen
tree
she
pluck
a
strip
of
smooth
white
bark
and
fair
and
many
signs
and
woful
graved
she
a
message
of
the
evil
things
to
be
then
deftly
closed
the
fold
on
fold
and
bound
the
tokens
well
and
cunningly
three
times
and
four
times
with
a
thread
of
gold
xix
give
these
to
argive
helen
hand
she
cried
and
so
embraced
her
child
and
with
no
fear
beheld
him
leaping
down
the
like
a
king
son
that
goes
to
hunt
the
deer
clad
softly
and
in
either
hand
a
spear
with
two
hounds
that
follow
him
so
leap
he
down
the
grassy
slopes
and
sheer
and
won
the
precinct
of
the
forest
dim
xx
he
trod
that
ancient
path
his
sire
had
trod
far
far
below
he
saw
the
sea
the
town
he
moved
as
light
as
an
immortal
god
for
mansions
in
olympus
gliding
down
he
left
the
shadow
of
the
forest
brown
and
through
the
shallow
waters
did
he
cross
and
stood
ere
twilight
fell
within
the
crown
of
towers
the
sacred
keep
of
ilios
xxi
now
folk
that
mark
him
hasting
deem
that
he
had
come
to
tell
the
host
was
on
its
way
as
one
that
from
the
hills
had
seen
the
sea
beclouded
with
the
danaan
array
so
straight
to
paris
house
with
no
delay
they
led
him
and
did
eagerly
await
within
the
forecourt
in
the
twilight
grey
to
hear
some
certain
message
of
their
fate
xxii
now
paris
was
asleep
upon
his
bed
tired
with
a
listless
day
but
all
along
the
palace
chambers
corythus
was
led
and
still
he
heard
a
music
shrill
and
strong
that
seem
to
clamour
of
an
wrong
and
hearts
a
long
time
broken
last
they
came
to
helen
bower
the
fountain
of
the
song
that
cried
so
loud
against
an
ancient
shame
xxiii
and
helen
fared
before
a
mighty
loom
and
sang
and
cast
her
shuttle
wrought
of
gold
and
forth
unto
the
utmost
secret
room
the
wave
of
her
wild
melody
was
roll
and
still
she
fashion
marvels
manifold
strange
shapes
of
fish
and
serpent
bear
and
swan
the
loves
of
the
immortal
gods
of
old
wherefrom
the
peoples
of
the
world
began
xxiv
now
helen
met
the
stranger
graciously
with
gentle
speech
and
bade
set
forth
a
chair
well
wrought
of
cedar
wood
and
ivory
that
wise
icmalius
had
fashion
fair
but
when
young
corythus
had
drunk
the
rare
wine
of
the
princes
and
had
broken
bread
then
helen
took
the
word
and
bade
declare
his
instant
tidings
and
he
spake
and
said
xxv
lady
and
queen
i
have
a
secret
word
and
bear
a
token
sent
to
none
but
thee
also
i
bring
message
to
my
lord
that
spoken
to
another
may
not
be
then
helen
gave
a
sign
unto
her
three
and
they
went
forth
from
that
place
silent
they
went
and
all
forebodingly
they
left
the
man
and
woman
face
to
face
xxvi
then
from
his
breast
the
birchen
scroll
he
took
and
gave
to
helen
and
she
read
therein
oh
thou
that
on
those
hidden
runes
dost
look
hast
thou
forgotten
quite
thine
ancient
sin
thy
lord
thy
lofty
palace
and
thy
kin
even
as
thy
love
forgets
the
words
he
spoke
the
strong
oath
broken
one
weak
heart
to
win
the
lips
that
kiss
him
and
the
heart
that
broke
xxvii
nay
but
methinks
thou
shalt
not
quite
forget
the
curse
wherewith
i
curse
thee
till
i
die
the
tears
that
on
the
cheeks
are
wet
shall
burn
thy
hateful
beauty
deathlessly
nor
shall
god
raise
up
seed
to
thee
but
i
have
borne
thy
love
this
messenger
my
son
who
yet
shall
make
him
glad
for
time
goes
by
and
soon
shall
thine
enchantments
all
be
done
xxviii
ay
soon
me
and
death
must
be
his
choice
and
little
in
that
hour
will
paris
care
for
thy
sweet
lips
and
for
thy
singing
voice
thine
arms
of
ivory
thy
golden
hair
nay
me
will
he
embrace
and
will
not
spare
but
bid
the
folk
that
hate
thee
have
their
joy
and
give
thee
to
the
mountain
beasts
to
tear
or
burn
thy
body
on
a
tower
of
troy
xxix
even
as
she
read
by
aphrodite
will
the
cloud
roll
back
from
helen
memory
she
saw
the
city
of
the
rifted
hill
fair
lacedaemon
her
mountain
high
she
knew
the
swift
eurotas
running
by
to
mix
his
sacred
waters
with
the
sea
and
from
the
garden
close
she
heard
the
cry
of
her
beloved
child
hermione
xxx
then
instantly
the
horror
of
her
shame
fell
on
her
and
she
saw
the
coming
years
famine
and
fire
and
plague
and
all
men
blame
the
wounds
of
warriors
and
the
women
fears
and
through
her
heart
her
sorrow
smote
like
spears
and
in
her
soul
she
knew
the
utmost
smart
of
wives
left
lonely
sires
bereaved
the
tears
of
maidens
desolate
of
loves
that
part
xxxi
she
drain
the
dregs
out
of
the
cup
of
hate
the
bitterness
of
sorrow
shame
and
scorn
the
tongues
of
mortals
curse
their
fate
she
saw
herself
an
outcast
and
forlorn
and
hating
sore
the
day
that
she
was
born
down
in
the
dust
she
cast
her
golden
head
there
with
rent
raiment
and
fair
tresses
torn
at
feet
of
corythus
she
lay
for
dead
xxxii
but
corythus
beholding
her
sweet
face
and
her
most
lovely
body
lying
low
had
pity
on
her
grief
and
on
her
grace
nor
heeded
now
she
was
his
mother
foe
but
did
what
might
be
done
to
ease
her
woe
while
as
he
thought
with
death
for
life
she
strove
and
loosed
the
necklet
round
her
neck
of
snow
as
who
that
saw
had
deem
with
hands
of
love
xxxiii
and
there
was
one
that
saw
for
paris
woke
and
that
the
van
of
the
great
argive
host
had
scared
the
folk
and
down
the
echoing
corridor
he
ran
to
helen
bower
and
there
beheld
the
man
that
kneel
beside
his
lady
lying
there
no
word
he
spake
but
drove
his
sword
a
span
through
corythus
fair
neck
and
cluster
hair
xxxiv
then
fell
fair
corythus
as
falls
the
tower
an
earthquake
shaketh
from
a
city
crown
or
as
a
tall
white
fragrant
a
child
hath
in
the
garden
trampled
down
or
as
a
in
the
forest
brown
fell
by
the
on
mountain
lands
when
they
to
harry
foreign
folk
are
boune
taking
their
own
lives
in
their
reckless
hands
xxxv
but
still
in
paris
did
his
anger
burn
and
still
his
sword
was
lifted
up
to
slay
when
like
a
lot
leap
forth
of
fate
own
urn
he
mark
the
graven
tokens
where
they
lay
helen
hair
in
golden
disarray
and
looking
on
them
knew
what
he
had
done
knew
what
dire
thing
had
fallen
on
that
day
knew
how
a
father
hand
had
slain
a
son
xxxvi
then
paris
on
his
face
fell
grovelling
and
the
night
gather
and
the
silence
grew
within
the
darkened
chamber
of
the
king
but
helen
rose
and
a
sad
breath
she
drew
and
her
new
woes
came
back
to
her
anew
ah
where
is
he
but
knows
the
bitter
pain
to
wake
from
dreams
and
find
his
sorrow
true
and
his
ill
life
returned
to
him
again
xxxvii
she
needed
none
to
tell
her
whence
it
fell
the
thick
red
rain
upon
the
marble
floor
she
knew
that
in
her
bower
she
might
not
dwell
alone
with
her
own
heart
for
ever
more
no
sacrifice
no
spell
no
priestly
lore
could
banish
quite
the
melancholy
ghost
of
corythus
a
herald
sent
before
them
that
should
die
for
her
a
dreadful
host
xxxviii
but
slowly
paris
raised
him
from
the
earth
and
read
her
face
and
knew
that
she
knew
all
no
more
her
eyes
in
tenderness
or
mirth
should
answer
his
in
bower
or
in
hall
nay
love
had
fallen
when
his
child
did
fall
the
stream
love
can
not
cross
ran
them
red
no
more
was
helen
his
befall
not
though
the
goddess
drove
her
to
his
bed
xxxix
this
word
he
spake
the
fates
are
hard
on
us
then
bade
the
women
do
what
must
be
done
to
the
fair
body
of
dead
corythus
and
then
he
hurl
into
the
night
alone
wailing
unto
the
spirit
of
his
son
that
somewhere
in
dark
mist
and
sighing
wind
must
dwell
nor
yet
to
hades
had
it
won
nor
quite
had
left
the
world
of
men
behind
xl
but
wild
oenone
by
the
saw
not
her
son
returning
to
the
wold
and
now
was
she
in
fear
and
now
in
wrath
she
cried
he
hath
forgot
the
mountain
fold
and
goes
in
ilios
with
a
crown
of
gold
but
even
then
she
heard
men
axes
smite
against
the
beeches
slim
and
old
these
ancient
trees
wherein
she
did
delight
xli
then
she
arose
and
silently
as
sleep
unseen
she
follow
the
wain
beneath
an
ashen
sky
that
to
weep
too
heavy
laden
with
the
latter
rain
and
all
the
folk
of
troy
upon
the
plain
she
found
all
gather
round
a
funeral
pyre
and
thereon
lay
her
son
her
darling
slain
the
goodly
corythus
her
heart
desire
xlii
among
the
spices
and
fair
robes
he
lay
his
arm
beneath
his
head
as
though
he
slept
for
so
the
goddess
wrought
that
no
decay
no
loathly
thing
about
his
body
crept
and
all
the
people
look
on
him
and
wept
and
weeping
paris
lit
the
dry
and
lo
a
rainy
wind
arose
and
swept
the
flame
and
fragrance
far
into
the
sky
xliii
but
when
the
force
of
flame
was
burning
low
then
did
they
drench
the
pyre
with
ruddy
wine
and
the
white
bones
of
corythus
bestow
within
a
gold
cruse
wrought
with
many
a
sign
and
wrapp
the
cruse
about
with
linen
fine
and
bare
it
to
the
tomb
when
lo
the
wild
oenone
sprang
with
burning
eyes
divine
and
shriek
unto
the
slayer
of
her
child
xliv
oh
thou
that
like
a
god
art
sire
and
slayer
that
like
a
god
dost
give
and
take
away
methinks
that
even
now
i
hear
the
prayer
thou
shalt
beseech
me
with
some
later
day
when
all
the
world
to
thy
dim
eyes
grow
grey
and
thou
shalt
crave
thy
healing
at
my
hand
then
gladly
will
i
mock
and
say
thee
nay
and
watch
thine
hours
run
down
like
running
sand
xlv
yea
thou
shalt
die
and
leave
thy
love
behind
and
little
shall
she
love
thy
memory
but
oh
ye
foolish
people
deaf
and
blind
what
death
is
coming
on
you
from
the
sea
then
all
men
turned
and
lo
upon
the
lee
of
tenedos
beneath
the
driving
rain
the
countless
argive
ships
were
racing
free

wind
and
oarsmen
speeding
them

xlvi
then
from
the
barrow
and
the
burial
back
like
a
bursting
torrent
all
men
fled
back
to
the
city
and
the
sacred
wall
but
paris
stood
and
lifted
not
his
head
alone
he
stood
and
brooded
the
dead
as
broods
a
lion
when
a
shaft
hath
flown
and
through
the
strong
heart
of
his
mate
hath
sped
then
will
he
face
the
hunters
all
alone
xlvii
but
soon
the
voice
of
men
on
the
came
round
him
and
he
turned
and
gazed
and
lo
the
argive
ships
were
dashing
on
the
strand
then
stealthily
did
paris
bend
his
bow
and
on
the
string
he
laid
a
shaft
of
woe
and
drew
it
to
the
point
and
aim
it
well
singing
it
sped
and
through
a
shield
did
go
and
from
his
barque
protesilaus
fell
xlviii
half
gladdened
by
the
omen
through

to

he
that

rain
the

not

the
shaft
of

glad
and

and
on
the

his

like

still

fled
he
menelaus
on
a
day
and
there
had
died
but
aphrodite
power
him
in
a
golden
cloud
did
safe
convey
within
the
walls
of
helen
fragrant
bower
but
she
in
longing
for
her
lord
and
home
and
scorn
of
her
wild
lover
did
withdraw
from
all
men
eyes
but
in
the
night
would
roam
till
drowsy
watchmen
of
the
city
saw
a
shadowy
shape
that
chill
the
night
with
awe
treading
the
battlements
and
like
a
ghost
she
stretch
her
lovely
arms
without
a
flaw
in
shame
and
longing
to
the
argive
host
vi
but
all
day
long
within
her
bower
she
wept
still
dreaming
of
the
dames
renown
of
old
whom
hate
or
love
of
the
immortals
swept
within
the
toils
of
ate
manifold
and
most
she
loved
the
ancient
tales
that
told
how
the
great
gods
at
length
to
pity
stirr
changed
niobe
upon
the
mountains
cold
to
a
cold
stone
and
procne
to
a
bird
vii
and
myrrha
to
an
tree
and
ah
she
murmur
that
the
gods
were
kind
and
bade
the
harpies
lay
their
hands
on
me
and
bear
me
with
the
currents
of
the
wind
to
the
dim
end
of
all
things
and
the
blind
land
where
the
ocean
turneth
in
his
bed
then
should
i
leave
mine
evil
days
behind
and
sleep
should
fold
his
wings
above
my
head
viii
and
once
she
heard
a
trojan
woman
bless
the
menelaus
her
good
lord
as
brave
among
brave
men
not
merciless
not
swift
to
slay
the
captives
of
his
sword
nor
wont
was
he
to
win
the
gold
of
them
that
sell
their
captives
over
sea
and
helen
sighed
and
bless
her
for
that
word
yet
will
he
be
merciful
to
me
ix
in
no
wise
found
she
comfort
to
abide
in
ilios
was
to
dwell
with
shame
and
fear
and
if
unto
the
argive
host
she
hied
then
should
she
die
by
him
that
was
most
dear
and
still
the
days
dragg
on
with
bitter
cheer
till
even
the
great
gods
had
little
joy
so
fast
their
children
fell
beneath
the
spear
below
the
windy
battlements
of
troy
x
yet
many
a
prince
of
south
lands
or
of
east
for
dark
cassandra
love
came
trooping
in
and
priam
made
them
merry
at
the
feast
and
all
night
long
they
dream
of
wars
to
win
and
with
the
morning
hurl
into
the
din
and
cried
their
lady
name
for
and
won
no
more
than
this
for
paris
sin
by
diomede
or
aias
hand
to
die
xi
but
for
one
hour
within
the
night
of
woes
the
hope
of
troy
burn
steadfast
as
a
star
when
strife
among
the
argive
lords
arose
and
dread
achilles
held
him
from
the
war
yea
and
apollo
from
his
golden
car
and
silver
bow
his
shafts
of
evil
sped
and
all
the
plain
was
darken
near
and
far
with
smoke
above
the
pyres
of
heroes
dead
xii
and
many
a
time
through
vapour
of
that
smoke
the
shafts
of
troy
fell
fast
and
on
the
plain
all
night
the
trojan
watch
fires
burn
and
broke
like
evil
stars
athwart
a
mist
of
rain
and
through
the
arms
and
blood
and
through
the
slain
like
wolves
among
the
fragments
of
the
fight
crept
spies
to
slay
forgat
his
pain
one
hour
and
fell
on
slumber
in
the
night
xiii
and
once
when
wounded
chiefs
their
tents
did
keep
and
only
aias
might
his
weapons
wield
came
hector
with
his
host
and
smiting
deep
brake
bow
and
spear
brake
axe
and
glaive
and
shield
bulwark
and
battlement
must
rend
and
yield
and
by
the
ships
he
smote
the
foe
and
cast
fire
on
the
ships
and
the
stricken
field
the
trojans
saw
that
flame
arise
at
last
xiv
but
when
achilles
saw
the
soaring
flame
and
knew
the
ships
in
peril
suddenly
a
change
upon
his
wrathful
spirit
came
nor
will
he
that
the
danaans
should
die
but
call
his
myrmidons
and
with
a
cry
they
follow
where
like
foam
on
a
patroclus
crest
was
dancing
white
and
high
above
the
tide
that
back
the
trojans
drave
xv
but
like
a
rock
amid
the
shifting
sands
and
changing
springs
and
tumult
of
the
deep
sarpedon
stood
till
patroclus
hands
smitten
he
fell
then
death
and
gentle
sleep
bare
him
from
forth
the
battle
to
the
steep
where
shines
his
castle
the
lycian
dell
there
hath
he
burial
due
while
all
folk
weep
around
the
kindly
prince
that
loved
them
well
xvi
not
unavenged
he
fell
nor
all
alone
to
hades
did
his
soul
indignant
fly
for
soon
was
keen
patroclus
overthrown
by
hector
and
the
god
of
archery
and
hector
stripp
his
shining
panoply
bright
arms
achilles
lent
ah
naked
then
forgetful
wholly
of
his
chivalry
patroclus
lay
nor
heard
the
strife
of
men
xvii
then
hector
from
the
war
a
little
space
withdrew
and
clad
him
in
achilles
gear
and
braced
the
gleaming
helmet
on
his
face
and
donn
the
corslet
and
that
mighty
spear
he
grasped
the
lance
that
makes
the
boldest
fear
and
home
his
comrades
bare
his
arms
of
gold
those
priam
once
had
worn
his
father
dear
but
in
his
father
arms
he
waxed
not
old
xviii
then
round
patroclus
body
like
a
tide
that
storms
the
swollen
outlet
of
a
stream
when
the
winds
blow
and
the
rains
fall
and
wide
the
river
runs
and
white
the
breakers
gleam
trojans
and
argives
battled
till
the
beam
of
helios
was
sinking
to
the
wave
and
now
they
near
the
ships
yet
few
could
deem
that
arms
of
argos
might
the
body
save
xix
but
even
then
the
tidings
sore
were
borne
to
great
achilles
of
patroclus
dead
and
all
his
goodly
raiment
hath
he
torn
and
cast
the
dust
upon
his
golden
head
and
many
a
tear
and
bitter
did
he
shed
ay
there
by
his
own
sword
had
he
been
slain
but
swift
his
thetis
sped
forth
with
her
lovely
from
the
main
xx
for
as
a
mother
when
her
young
child
calls
hearkens
to
that
and
hath
no
other
care
so
thetis
from
her
green
and
windless
halls
rose
at
the
first
word
of
achilles
prayer
to
comfort
him
and
promise
gifts
of
fair
new
armour
wrought
by
an
immortal
hand
then
like
a
silver
cloud
she
scaled
the
air
where
bright
the
dwellings
of
olympus
stand
xxi
but
as
a
beacon
from
a
town
within
a
isle
leaps
suddenly
a
cloud
by
day
but
when
the
sun
goes
down
the
tongues
of
fire
flash
out
and
soar
on
high
to
summon
warlike
men
that
dwell
thereby
and
bid
them
bring
a
rescue
so
now
athene
sent
a
flame
to
fly
from
brow
and
temples
of
aeacides
xxii
then
all
unarm
he
sped
and
through
the
throng
he
pass
to
the
dyke
edge
beyond
the
wall
nor
leap
the
ranks
of
fighting
men
among
but
shouted
clearer
than
the
clarion
call
when
foes
on
a
beleaguer
city
fall
three
times
he
cried
and
terror
fell
on
these
that
heard
him
and
the
trojans
one
and
all
fled
from
that
shouting
of
aeacides
xxiii
backward
the
trojans
reel
in
headlong
flight
chariots
and
men
and
left
their
bravest
slain
and
the
sun
fell
but
troy
through
all
the
night
watch
by
her
fires
upon
the
ilian
plain
for
hector
did
the
sacred
walls
disdain
of
ilios
nor
knew
that
he
should
stand
ere
night
return
and
burial
crave
in
vain
unarm
forsaken
at
achilles
hand
xxiv
but
all
that
night
within
his
chamber
high
hephaestus
made
his
iron
anvils
ring
and
ere
the
dawn
had
wrought
a
panoply
the
goodliest
ever
worn
by
mortal
king
this
to
the
argive
camp
did
thetis
bring
and
when
her
child
had
proved
it
like
the
star
that
heralds
day
he
went
forth
summoning
the
host
achaean
to
delight
of
war
xxv
and
as
a
mountain
torrent
leaves
its
bed
and
seaward
sweeps
the
toils
of
men
in
spate
or
as
a
that
overhead
burns
in
the
boughs
a
thing
insatiate
so
raged
the
fierce
achilles
in
his
hate
and
xanthus
angry
for
his
trojans
slain
brake
forth
while
fire
and
wind
made
desolate
what
war
and
wave
had
spared
upon
the
plain
xxvi
now
through
the
fume
and
vapour
of
the
smoke
between
the
wind
voice
and
the
water
cry
the
battle
shouting
of
the
trojans
broke
and
reached
the
ilian
walls
confusedly
but
over
soon
the
folk
that
watch
might
spy
thin
broken
bands
that
fled
avoiding
death
yet
many
a
man
beneath
the
spear
must
die
ere
by
the
sacred
gateway
they
drew
breath
xxvii
and
as
when
fire
doth
on
a
forest
fall
and
hot
winds
bear
it
raging
in
its
flight
and
beechen
boughs
and
pines
are
ruin
all
so
raged
achilles
anger
in
that
fight
and
many
an
empty
car
with
none
to
smite
the
madden
horses
the
bridge
of
war
was
wildly
whirled
and
many
a
maid
delight
that
day
to
the
red
wolves
was
dearer
far
xxviii
some
muse
that
loved
not
troy
hath
done
thee
wrong
homer
who
whisper
thee
that
hector
fled
thrice
round
the
sacred
walls
he
kept
so
long
nay
when
he
saw
his
people
vanquished
alone
he
stood
for
troy
alone
he
sped
one
moment
to
the
struggle
of
the
spear
and
by
the
gods
deserted
fell
and
bled
a
warrior
stainless
of
reproach
and
fear
xxix
then
all
the
people
from
the
battlement
beheld
what
dreadful
things
achilles
wrought
for
on
the
body
his
revenge
he
spent
the
anger
of
the
high
gods
heeding
nought
to
whom
was
hector
dearest
while
he
fought
of
all
the
trojan
men
that
were
their
joy
but
now
no
more
their
favour
might
be
bought
by
savour
of
his
hecatombs
in
troy
xxx
so
for
twelve
days
rejoiced
the
argive
host
and
now
patroclus
hath
to
hades
won
but
hector
naked
lay
and
still
his
ghost
must
wail
where
waters
of
cocytus
run
till
priam
did
what
no
man
born
hath
done
who
dared
to
pass
among
the
argive
bands
and
clasp
the
knees
of
him
that
slew
his
son
and
kiss
his
awful
homicidal
hands
xxxi
at
such
a
price
was
hector
body
sent
to
ilios
where
the
women
wail
him
shrill
and
helen
sorrow
brake
into
lament
as
bursts
a
lake
the
barriers
of
a
hill
for
lost
lost
lost
was
that
one
friend
who
still
stood
by
her
with
kind
speech
and
gentle
heart
the
sword
of
war
pure
faith
and
steadfast
will
that
strove
to
keep
all
evil
things
apart
xxxii
and
so
men
buried
hector
but
they
came
the
amazons
from
frozen
fields
afar
a
match
for
heroes
in
the
dreadful
game
of
spears
the
darlings
of
the
god
of
war
whose
coming
was
to
priam
dearer
far
than
light
to
him
that
is
a
long
while
blind
when
leech
hand
hath
taen
away
the
bar
that
vex
him
or
the
healing
god
is
kind
xxxiii
and
troy
was
glad
and
with
the
morning
light
the
amazons
went
forth
to
slay
and
slay
and
wondrously
they
drave
the
foe
in
flight
until
the
sun
had
wander
half
his
way
but
when
he
stoop
to
twilight
and
the
grey
hour
when
men
loose
the
steer
beneath
the
yoke
no
more
achilles
held
him
from
the
fray
but
dreadful
through
the
women
ranks
he
broke
xxxiv
then
comes
eclipse
upon
the
crescent
shield
and
death
on
them
that
bear
it
and
they
fall
one
here
one
there
about
the
stricken
field
as
in
that
art
of
love
memorial
which
moulders
on
the
holy
carian
wall
ay
still
we
see
still
love
still
pity
there
the
so
brave
so
tall
in
time
despite
imperishably
fair
xxxv
but
as
a
dove
that
braves
a
falcon
stood
penthesilea
wrath
outcasting
fear
or
as
a
hind
that
in
the
darkling
wood
withstands
a
lion
for
her
younglings
dear
so
stood
the
girl
before
achilles
spear
in
vain
for
singing
from
his
hand
it
sped
and
crash
through
shield
and
breastplate
till
the
sheer
cold
bronze
drank
blood
and
down
the
queen
fell
dead
xxxvi
then
from
her
locks
the
helm
achilles
tore
and
boasted
the
slain
but
lo
the
face
of
her
thus
lying
in
the
dust
and
gore
seem
lovelier
than
is
the
maiden
grace
of
artemis
when
weary
from
the
chase
she
sleepeth
in
a
haunted
dell
unknown
and
all
the
argives
marvell
for
a
space
but
most
achilles
made
a
heavy
moan
xxxvii
and
in
his
heart
there
came
the
weary
thought
of
all
that
was
and
all
that
might
have
been
of
all
the
sorrow
that
his
sword
had
wrought
of
death
that
now
drew
near
him
of
the
green
vales
of
larissa
where
with
such
a
queen
with
such
a
love
as
now
his
spear
had
slain
he
had
been
happy
who
must
wind
the
skein
of
grievous
wars
and
be
glad
again
xxxviii
yea
now
wax
fate
half
weary
of
her
game
and
had
no
care
but
aye
to
kill
and
kill
and
many
young
kings
to
the
battle
came
and
of
that
joy
they
quickly
had
their
fill
and
last
came
memnon
and
the
trojans
still
took
heart
like
wearied
mariners
that
see
long
toss
on
unknown
waves
at
the
winds
will
through
clouds
the
gleaming
crest
of
helike
xxxix
for
memnon
was
the
child
of
the
bright
dawn
a
goddess
wedded
to
a
mortal
king
who
dwells
for
ever
on
the
shores
withdrawn
that
border
on
the
land
of
and
he
was
nurtured
nigh
the
sacred
spring
that
is
the
hidden
fountain
of
all
seas
by
them
that
in
the
gods
own
garden
sing
the
call
hesperides
xl
but
him
the
child
of
thetis
in
the
fight
met
on
a
windy
winter
day
when
high
the
dust
was
whirled
and
wrapp
them
like
the
night
that
falleth
on
the
mountains
stealthily
when
the
floods
come
and
down
their
courses
dry
the
torrents
roar
and
lightning
flasheth
far
so
rang
so
shone
their
harness
terribly
beneath
the
blinding
of
war
xli
then
the
dawn
shudder
on
her
golden
throne
and
called
unto
the
west
wind
and
he
blew
and
brake
the
cloud
asunder
and
alone
achilles
stood
but
memnon
smitten
through
lay
beautiful
amid
the
dreadful
dew
of
battle
and
a
deathless
heart
was
fain
of
tears
to
gods
impossible
that
drew
from
mortal
hearts
a
little
of
their
pain
xlii
but
now
their
leader
slain
the
trojans
fled
and
fierce
achilles
drove
them
in
his
hate
avenging
still
his
dear
patroclus
dead
nor
knew
the
hour
with
his
own
doom
was
great
nor
trembled
standing
in
the
scaean
gate
where
ancient
prophecy
foretold
his
fall
then
suddenly
there
sped
the
bolt
of
fate
and
smote
achilles
by
the
ilian
wall
xliii
from
paris
bow
it
sped
and
even
there
even
as
he
grasp
the
skirts
of
victory
achilles
fell
nor
any
man
might
dare
from
forth
the
trojan
gateway
to
draw
nigh
but
as
the
woodmen
watch
a
lion
die
pierced
with
the
hunter
arrow
nor
come
near
till
death
hath
veil
his
eyelids
utterly
even
so
the
trojans
held
aloof
in
fear
xliv
but
there
his
fellows
on
his
wondrous
shield
laid
the
fair
body
of
achilles
slain
and
sadly
bare
him
through
the
trampled
field
and
lo
the
deathless
maidens
of
the
main
rose
up
with
thetis
from
the
windy
plain
and
round
the
dead
man
beautiful
they
cried
lamenting
and
with
melancholy
strain
the
muses
mournfully
replied
xlv
yea
muses
and
sang
his
dirge
and
mightily
the
chant
arose
and
shrill
and
wondrous
echoes
answer
from
the
surge
of
the
grey
sea
and
from
the
holy
hill
of
ida
and
the
heavy
clouds
and
chill
were
gathering
like
mourners
sad
and
slow
and
zeus
did
thunder
mightily
and
fill
the
dells
and
glades
of
ida
deep
with
snow
xlvi
now
paris
was
not
sated
with
the
fame
and
rich
reward
troy
gave
his
archery
but
the
wine
he
boasted
that
the
game
that
very
night
he
deem
to
win
or
die
for
scarce
their
watch
the
tempest
will
defy
he
said
and
all
undream
of
might
we
go
and
fall
upon
the
argives
where
they
lie
unseen
unheard
amid
the
silent
snow
xlvii
so
flush
with
wine
and
clad
in
raiment
white
above
their
mail
the
young
men
follow
him
their
guide
a
fading
in
the
night
and
the
sea
moaning
in
the
distance
dim
and
still
with
eddying
snow
the
air
did
swim
and
darkly
did
they
wend
they
knew
not
where
white
in
that
cursed
night
an
army
grim
with
wine
and
blind
with
whirling
air
xlviii
there
was
an
outcast
in
the
argive
host
one
philoctetes
whom
odysseus
wile
for
save
he
help
the
leaguer
all
was
lost
drew
from
his
lair
within
the
lemnian
isle
but
him
the
people
as
a
leper
vile
hated
and
drave
to
a
lone
hut
afar
for
wounded
sore
was
he
and
many
a
while
his
cries
would
wake
the
host
foredone
with
war
xlix
now
philoctetes
was
an
archer
wight
but
in
his
quiver
had
he
little
store
of
arrows
tipp
with
bronze
and
feather
bright
nay
his
were
blue
with
mould
and
fretted
with
many
a
spell
melampus
wrought
of
yore
singing
above
his
task
a
song
of
bane
and
they
were
venom
with
the
centaur
gore
and
tipp
with
bones
of
men
a
long
while
slain
this
wretch
for
very
pain
might
seldom
sleep
and
that
night
slept
not
in
the
moaning
blast
he
deem
the
dead
about
his
hut
did
creep
and
silently
he
rose
and
round
him
cast
his
raiment
foul
and
from
the
door
he
pass
and
peer
into
the
night
and
soothly
heard
a
whisper
voice
then
gripp
his
arrows
fast
and
strung
his
bow
and
cried
a
bitter
word
li
art
thou
a
gibbering
ghost
with
war
outworn
and
thy
faint
life
in
hades
not
begun
art
thou
a
man
that
holdst
my
grief
in
scorn
and
yet
dost
live
and
look
upon
the
sun
if
man
methinks
thy
pleasant
days
are
done
and
thou
shalt
writhe
in
torment
worse
than
mine
if
ghost
new
pain
in
hades
hast
thou
won
and
there
with
double
woe
shalt
surely
pine
lii
he
spake
and
drew
the
string
and
sent
a
shaft
at
venture
through
the
midnight
and
the
snow
a
little
while
he
listen
then
he
within
himself
a
dreadful
laugh
and
low
for
over
well
the
answer
did
he
know
that
midnight
gave
his
message
the
sharp
cry
and
armour
rattling
on
a
fallen
foe
that
now
was
learning
what
it
is
to
die
liii
then
philoctetes
crawl
into
his
den
and
hugg
himself
against
the
bitter
cold
while
round
their
leader
came
the
trojan
men
and
bound
his
wound
and
bare
him
the
wold
back
to
the
lights
of
ilios
but
the
gold
of
dawn
was
breaking
on
the
mountains
white
or
ere
they
won
within
the
guarded
fold
long
in
the
tempest
and
the
night
liv
and
through
the
gate
and
through
the
silent
street
and
houses
where
men
dream
of
war
no
more
the
bearers
wander
with
their
weary
feet
and
paris
to
his
house
they
bore
but
vainly
leeches
on
his
wound
did
pore
and
vain
was
argive
helen
magic
song
ah
vain
her
healing
hands
and
all
her
lore
to
help
the
life
that
wrought
her
endless
wrong
lv
slow
pass
the
fever
hours
until
the
grey
cold
light
was
paling
and
a
sullen
glow
of
livid
yellow
crown
the
dying
day
and
brooded
on
the
wastes
of
mournful
snow
then
paris
whisper
faintly
i
must
go
and
face
that
wild
of
the
hill
for
none
but
she
can
win
from
overthrow
troy
life
and
mine
that
guards
it
if
she
will
lvi
so
through
the
dumb
white
meadows
deep
with
snow
they
bore
him
on
a
pallet
shrouded
white
and
sore
they
dreaded
lest
an
ambush
foe
should
hear
him
moan
or
mark
the
moving
light
that
waved
before
their
footsteps
in
the
night
and
much
they
joy
when
ida
knees
were
won
and
the
pines
upon
an
upland
height
they
watch
the
star
that
heraldeth
the
sun
lvii
for
under
woven
branches
of
the
pine
the
soft
dry
needles
like
a
carpet
spread
and
high
above
the
arching
boughs
did
shine
in
frosty
fret
of
silver
that
the
red
new
dawn
fired
into
overhead
within
that
vale
where
paris
oft
had
been
with
fair
oenone
ere
the
hills
he
fled
to
be
the
sinful
lover
of
a
queen
lviii
not
here
they
found
oenone
nay
not
here
said
paris
faint
and
low
shall
she
be
found
nay
bear
me
up
the
mountain
where
the
drear
winds
walk
for
ever
on
a
haunted
ground
methinks
i
hear
her
sighing
in
their
sound

some
god
calls
me
there
a
dying
man

my
latest
journeying
is
bound
back

the
sorrow
of
my
life
began

they
reach
the

glen

halted
what

should
be

thou
see
what
judgment
mine
old
love
will
pass
on

hide
thee
here
thou
soon
the

will
set
thee
free
from

old
net
they
wove
so
long

ah
there
with

round

like

pall
oenone
crouch
in
sable
robes
as
still
as
winter
brooding
the
summer
fall
or
niobe
upon
her
haunted
hill
a
woman
changed
to
stone
by
grief
where
chill
the
fall
like
tears
and
the
wind
sighs

deem
he
saw
a
deadly
will
unmoved
in
wild
oenone
frozen
eyes

prayer
to
her
were
vain
as
prayer
to

he
murmur
almost
glad
that
it
was
so
like
some
sick
man
that
need
no

wait

his
pain
lulls
as
death
draws
near
his
woe

beckon
to
his

they
bore
him
dying
from
that
fatal
place
and
did
not
turn
again
and
did
not
know
the
soft
repentance
on
oenone
face
lxii
but
paris
spake
to
helen
long
ago
dear
we
were
glad
who
never
more
shall
be
together
where
the
west
winds
fainter
blow
round
that
elysian
island
of
the
sea
where
zeus
from
evil
days
shall
set
thee
free
nay
kiss
me
once
it
is
a
weary
while
ten
weary
years
since
thou
hast
smiled
on
me
but
helen
say
with
thine
old
smile
lxiii
and
as
the
dying
sunset
through
the
rain
will
flush
with
rosy
glow
a
mountain
height
even
so
at
his
last
smile
a
blush
again
pass
over
helen
face
so
changed
and
white
and
through
her
tears
she
smiled
his
last
delight
the
last
of
pleasant
life
he
knew
for
grey
the
veil
of
darkness
gather
and
the
night
closed
his
head
and
paris
pass
away
lxiv
then
for
one
hour
in
helen
heart
awoke
the
fatal
love
that
was
of
old
ere
she
knew
all
and
the
cold
cheeks
outworn
she
kiss
she
kiss
the
hair
of
wasted
gold
the
hands
that
her
body
should
enfold
then
slow
she
follow
where
the
bearers
led
follow
dead
paris
through
the
frozen
wold
back
to
the
town
where
all
men
wish
her
dead
lxv
perchance
it
was
a
sin
i
know
not
this
it
be
she
had
a
woman
heart
and
not
without
a
tear
without
a
kiss
without
some
strange
new
birth
of
the
old
smart
from
her
old
love
of
the
brief
days
could
part
for
ever
though
the
dead
meet
shall
they
meet
and
be
glad
by
aphrodite
art
whose
souls
have
wander
each
its
several
way
lxvi
and
now
was
come
the
day
when
on
a
pyre
men
laid
fair
paris
in
a
broider
pall
and
fragrant
spices
cast
into
the
fire
and
round
the
flame
slew
many
an
argive
thrall
when
like
a
ghost
there
came
among
them
all
a
woman
once
beheld
by
them
of
yore
when
first
through
storm
and
driving
rain
the
tall
black
ships
of
argos
dash
upon
the
shore
lxvii
not
now
in
wrath
oenone
came
but
fair
like
a
young
bride
when
nigh
her
bliss
she
knows
and
in
the
soft
night
of
her
fallen
hair
shone
flowers
like
stars
more
white
than
ida
snows
and
scarce
men
dared
to
look
on
her
of
those
the
pyre
that
guarded
suddenly
she
came
and
sprang
upon
the
pyre
and
shrill
arose
her
song
of
death
like
incense
through
the
flame
lxviii
and
still
the
song
and
still
the
flame
went
up
but
when
the
flame
wax
fierce
the
singing
died
and
soon
with
red
wine
from
a
golden
cup
priests
drench
the
pyre
but
no
man
might
divide
the
ashes
of
the
bridegroom
from
the
bride
nay
they
were
wedded
and
at
rest
again
as
in
those
old
days
on
the
before
the
promise
of
their
youth
was
vain
book
vi
the
sack
of
troy
the
return
of
helen
the
sack
of
troy
and
of
how
menelaus
would
have
let
stone
helen
but
aphrodite
saved
her
and
made
them
at
one
again
and
how
they
came
home
to
lacedaemon
and
of
their
translation
to
elysium
i
there
came
a
day
when
trojan
spies
beheld
how
the
argive
leaguer
all
the
air
was
pure
of
smoke
no
there
swell
nor
any
was
sounding
there
yea
of
the
serried
ships
the
strand
was
bare
and
sea
and
shore
were
still
as
long
ago
when
ilios
knew
not
helen
and
the
fair
sweet
face
that
makes
immortal
all
her
woe
ii
so
for
a
space
the
watchers
on
the
wall
were
silent
what
these
things
might
mean
but
at
the
last
sent
messengers
to
call
priam
and
all
the
elders
and
the
lean
remnant
of
goodly
chiefs
that
once
had
been
the
shield
and
stay
of
ilios
and
her
joy
nor
yet
despair
but
trusted
gods
unseen
and
cast
their
spears
and
shed
their
blood
for
troy
iii
they
came
the
more
part
grey
grown
early
old
in
war
and
plague
but
with
them
was
the
young
coroebus
that
but
late
had
left
the
fold
and
flocks
of
sheep
maeonian
hills
among
and
valiantly
his
lot
with
priam
flung
for
love
of
a
lost
cause
and
a
fair
face
the
eyes
that
once
the
god
of
pytho
sung
that
now
look
darkly
to
the
iv
now
while
the
elders
kept
their
long
debate
coroebus
stole
unheeded
to
his
band
and
led
a
handful
by
a
postern
gate
across
the
plain
across
the
barren
land
where
once
the
happy
vines
were
wont
to
stand
and
the
clusters
once
did
maidens
sing
but
now
the
plain
was
waste
on
every
hand
though
here
and
there
a
flower
would
breathe
of
spring
so
swift
across
the
trampled
unchallenged
still
but
wary
did
they
pass
by
many
a
broken
spear
or
shatter
shield
that
in
fate
hour
appointed
faithless
was
only
the
heron
cried
from
the
morass
by
xanthus
side
and
ravens
and
the
grey
wolves
left
their
feasting
in
the
tangled
grass
grudging
and
loiter
nor
fled
far
away
vi
there
lurk
no
spears
in
the
high
no
ambush
by
the
cairns
of
men
outworn
but
empty
stood
the
huts
in
dismal
ranks
where
men
through
all
these
many
years
had
borne
fierce
summer
and
the
biting
winter
scorn
and
here
a
sword
was
left
and
there
a
bow
but
ruinous
seem
all
things
and
forlorn
as
in
some
camp
forsaken
long
ago
vii
gorged
wolves
crept
round
the
altars
and
did
eat
the
flesh
of
victims
that
the
priests
had
slain
and
wild
dogs
fought
above
the
sacred
meat
late
offer
to
the
deathless
gods
in
vain
by
men
that
for
reward
of
all
their
pain
must
haul
the
ropes
and
weary
at
the
oar
or
drowning
clutch
at
foam
amid
the
main
nor
win
their
haven
on
the
argive
shore
viii
not
long
the
young
men
marvell
at
the
sight
but
grasping
one
a
sword
and
one
the
spear
aias
or
tydeus
son
had
borne
in
fight
they
sped
and
fill
the
town
with
merry
cheer
for
folk
were
quick
the
happy
news
to
hear
and
pour
through
all
the
gates
into
the
plain
rejoicing
as
they
wander
far
and
near
the
long
argive
toils
endured
in
vain
ix
ah
sweet
it
was
without
the
city
walls
to
hear
the
doves
coo
and
the
finches
sing
ah
sweet
to
twine
their
coronals
of
woven
and
each
fragrant
thing
that
blossoms
in
the
footsteps
of
the
spring
and
sweet
to
lie
forgetful
of
their
grief
where
violets
trail
by
waters
wandering
and
the
wild
putteth
forth
his
leaf
x
now
while
they
wander
as
they
would
they
found
a
wondrous
thing
a
marvel
of
man
skill
that
stood
within
a
vale
of
hollow
ground
and
bulk
scarce
smaller
than
the
the
common
barrow
that
the
dead
men
fill
who
died
in
the
long
leaguer
not
of
earth
was
this
new
portent
but
of
tree
and
still
the
trojans
stood
and
marvell
their
mirth
xi
ay
much
they
wonder
what
this
thing
might
be
shaped
like
a
horse
it
was
and
many
a
stain
there
show
upon
the
mighty
beams
of
tree
for
some
with
fire
were
blacken
some
with
rain
were
dank
and
dark
amid
white
planks
of
plane
new
cut
among
the
trees
that
now
were
few
on
wasted
ida
but
men
gazed
in
vain
nor
truth
thereof
for
all
their
searching
knew
xii
at
length
they
deem
it
was
a
sacred
thing
vow
to
poseidon
monarch
of
the
deep
and
that
herewith
the
argives
pray
the
king
of
wind
and
wave
to
lull
the
seas
to
sleep
so
this
they
cried
within
the
sacred
keep
of
troy
must
rest
memorial
of
the
war
and
sturdily
they
haled
it
up
the
steep
and
dragg
the
monster
to
their
walls
afar
xiii
all
day
they
wrought
and
children
crown
with
flowers
laid
light
hands
on
the
ropes
old
men
would
ply
their
feeble
force
so
through
the
merry
hours
they
toil
midst
laughter
and
sweet
minstrelsy
and
late
they
drew
the
great
horse
to
the
high
crest
of
the
hill
and
wide
the
tall
gates
swang
but
thrice
for
all
their
force
it
stood
thereby
unmoved
and
thrice
like
smitten
armour
rang
xiv
natheless
they
wrought
their
will
then
altar
fires
the
trojans
built
and
did
the
gods
implore
to
grant
fulfilment
of
all
glad
desires
but
from
the
cups
the
wine
they
might
not
pour
the
flesh
upon
the
spits
did
writhe
and
roar
the
smoke
grew
red
as
blood
and
many
a
limb
of
victims
leap
upon
the
temple
floor
trembling
and
groans
amid
the
chapels
dim
xv
rang
low
and
from
the
fair
gods
images
and
from
their
eyes
dropp
sweat
and
many
a
tear
the
walls
with
blood
were
dripping
and
on
these
that
sacrificed
came
horror
and
great
fear
the
holy
laurels
to
apollo
dear
beside
his
temple
faded
suddenly
and
wild
wolves
from
the
mountains
drew
anear
and
ravens
through
the
temples
seem
to
fly
xvi
yet
still
the
men
of
troy
were
glad
at
heart
and
strange
meat
they
revell
like
folk
fey
though
each
would
shudder
if
he
glanced
apart
for
round
their
knees
the
mists
were
gather
grey
like
shrouds
on
men
that
take
their
way
but
merrily
withal
they
feasted
thus
and
laugh
with
crooked
lips
and
oft
would
say
some
word
and
ominous
xvii
and
hecuba
among
her
children
spake
let
each
man
choose
the
meat
he
liketh
best
for
bread
no
more
together
shall
we
break
nay
soon
from
all
my
labour
must
i
rest
but
eat
ye
well
and
drink
the
red
wine
lest
ye
blame
my
among
men
dead
and
all
they
took
her
saying
for
a
jest
and
sweetly
did
they
laugh
at
that
she
said
xviii
then
like
a
raven
on
the
of
night
the
wild
cassandra
flitted
far
and
near
still
crying
gather
gather
for
the
fight
and
brace
the
helmet
on
and
grasp
the
spear
for
lo
the
legions
of
the
night
are
here
so
shriek
the
dreadful
prophetess
divine
but
all
men
mock
and
were
of
merry
cheer
safe
as
the
gods
they
deem
them
their
wine
xix
for
now
with
minstrelsy
the
air
was
sweet
the
soft
spring
air
and
thick
with
incense
smoke
and
bands
of
happy
dancers
down
the
street
flew
from
the
doors
and
wheel
and
broke
and
loving
words
the
youths
and
maidens
spoke
for
aphrodite
did
their
hearts
beguile
as
when
beneath
grey
cavern
or
green
oak
the
shepherd
men
and
maidens
meet
and
smile
xx
no
guard
they
set
for
truly
to
them
all
did
love
and
slumber
seem
exceeding
good
there
was
no
watch
by
open
gate
nor
wall
no
sentinel
by
pallas
image
stood
but
silence
grew
as
in
an
autumn
wood
when
tempests
die
and
the
vex
boughs
have
ease
and
wind
and
sunlight
fade
and
soft
the
mood
of
sacred
twilight
falls
upon
the
trees
xxi
then
the
stars
cross
the
zenith
and
there
came
on
troy
that
hour
when
slumber
is
most
deep
but
any
man
that
watch
had
seen
a
flame
spring
from
the
tall
crest
of
the
trojan
keep
while
from
the
belly
of
the
horse
did
leap
men
arm
and
to
the
gates
went
stealthily
while
up
the
rocky
way
to
ilios
creep
the
argives
new
return
across
the
sea
xxii
now
when
the
silence
broke
and
in
that
hour
when
first
the
dawn
of
war
was
blazing
red
there
came
a
light
in
helen
fragrant
bower
as
on
that
evil
night
before
she
fled
from
lacedaemon
and
her
marriage
bed
and
helen
in
great
fear
lay
still
and
cold
for
aphrodite
stood
above
her
head
and
spake
in
that
sweet
voice
she
knew
of
old
xxiii
beloved
one
that
dost
not
love
me
wake
helen
the
night
is
over
the
dawn
is
near
and
safely
shalt
thou
fare
with
me
and
take
thy
way
through
fire
and
blood
and
have
no
fear
a
little
hour
and
ended
is
the
drear
tale
of
thy
sorrow
and
thy
wandering
nay
long
hast
thou
to
live
in
happy
cheer
by
fair
eurotas
with
thy
lord
the
king
xxiv
then
helen
rose
and
in
a
cloud
of
gold
unseen
amid
the
vapour
of
the
fire
did
aphrodite
veil
her
fold
on
fold
and
through
the
darkness
thronged
with
faces
dire
and
men
bodies
fallen
in
a
mire
of
new
spilt
blood
and
wine
the
twain
did
go
where
lust
and
hate
were
mingled
in
desire
and
dreams
and
death
were
blended
in
one
woe
xxv
fire
and
the
foe
were
masters
now
the
sky
flared
like
the
dawn
of
that
last
day
of
all
when
men
for
pity
to
the
sea
shall
cry
and
vainly
on
the
mountain
tops
shall
call
to
fall
and
end
the
horror
in
their
fall
and
through
the
vapour
dreadful
things
saw
they
the
maidens
leaping
from
the
city
wall
the
sleeping
children
murder
where
they
lay
xxvi
yea
cries
like
those
that
make
the
hills
of
hell
ring
and
sounded
through
the
night
the
screams
of
burning
horses
and
the
yell
of
young
men
leaping
naked
into
fight
and
shrill
the
women
shriek
as
in
their
flight
shriek
the
wild
cranes
when
overhead
they
spy
between
the
dusky
and
the
bright
blue
air
an
eagle
stooping
from
the
sky
xxvii
and
now
the
red
glare
of
the
burning
shone
on
deeds
so
dire
the
pure
gods
might
not
bear
save
ares
only
long
to
look
thereon
but
with
a
cloud
they
darken
all
the
air
and
even
then
within
the
temple
fair
of
chaste
athene
did
cassandra
cower
and
cried
aloud
an
unavailing
prayer
for
aias
was
the
master
in
that
hour
xxviii
man
lust
won
what
a
god
love
might
not
win
and
heroes
trembled
and
the
temple
floor
shook
when
one
cry
went
up
into
the
din
and
shamed
the
night
to
silence
then
the
roar
of
war
and
fire
wax
great
as
heretofore
till
each
roof
fell
and
every
palace
gate
was
shatter
and
the
king
blood
shed
nor
more
remain
to
do
for
troy
was
desolate
xxix
then
dawn
drew
near
and
changed
to
clouds
of
rose
the
dreadful
smoke
that
clung
to
ida
head
but
ilios
was
ashes
and
the
foes
had
left
the
embers
and
the
plunder
dead
and
down
the
steep
they
drove
the
prey
and
sped
back
to
the
swift
ships
with
a
captive
train
while
menelaus
slow
with
drooping
head
follow
like
one
lamenting
through
the
plain
xxx
where
death
might
seem
the
surest
by
the
gate
of
priam
where
the
spears
raged
and
the
tall
towers
on
the
foe
were
falling
sought
he
fate
to
look
on
helen
once
and
then
to
fall
nor
see
with
living
eyes
the
end
of
all
what
time
the
host
their
vengeance
should
fulfil
and
cast
her
from
the
cliff
below
the
wall
or
burn
her
body
on
the
windy
hill
xxxi
but
helen
found
he
never
where
the
flame
sprang
to
the
roofs
and
helen
he
found
where
flock
the
wretched
women
in
their
shame
the
helpless
altars
of
the
gods
around
nor
lurk
she
in
deep
chambers
underground
where
the
priests
trembled
their
hidden
gold
nor
where
the
armed
feet
of
foes
resound
in
shrines
to
silence
consecrate
of
old
xxxii
so
wounded
to
his
hut
and
wearily
came
menelaus
and
he
bow
his
head
beneath
the
lintel
neither
fair
nor
high
and
lo
queen
helen
lay
upon
his
bed
flush
like
a
child
in
sleep
and
and
at
his
footstep
did
she
wake
and
smile
and
spake
my
lord
how
hath
thy
hunting
sped
methinks
that
i
have
slept
a
weary
while
xxxiii
for
aphrodite
made
the
past
unknown
to
helen
as
of
old
when
in
the
dew
of
that
fair
dawn
the
net
was
round
her
thrown
nay
now
no
memory
of
troy
brake
through
the
mist
that
veil
from
her
sweet
eyes
and
blue
the
dreadful
days
and
deeds
all
and
gladly
did
she
greet
her
lord
anew
and
gladly
would
her
arms
have
round
him
cast
xxxiv
then
leap
she
up
in
terror
for
he
stood
before
her
like
a
lion
of
the
wild
his
rusted
armour
all
bestain
with
blood
his
mighty
hands
with
blood
of
men
defiled
and
strange
was
all
she
saw
the
spears
the
piled
raw
skins
of
slaughter
beasts
with
many
a
stain
and
low
he
spake
and
bitterly
he
smiled
the
hunt
is
ended
and
the
spoil
is
xxxv
no
more
he
spake
for
certainly
he
that
aphrodite
brought
her
to
that
place
and
that
of
her
loved
archer
helen
dream
of
paris
at
that
thought
the
mood
of
grace
died
in
him
and
he
hated
her
fair
face
and
bound
her
hard
not
slacking
for
her
tears
then
silently
departed
for
a
space
to
seek
the
ruthless
counsel
of
his
peers
xxxvi
now
all
the
kings
were
feasting
in
much
joy
seated
or
couch
upon
the
carpets
fair
that
late
had
strown
the
palace
floors
of
troy
and
lovely
trojan
ladies
served
them
there
and
meat
from
off
the
spits
young
princes
bare
but
menelaus
burst
among
them
all
strange
their
revelry
and
did
not
spare
but
bade
the
kings
a
sudden
council
call
xxxvii
to
mar
their
feast
the
kings
had
little
will
yet
did
they
as
he
bade
in
grudging
wise
and
heralds
call
the
host
unto
the
hill
heap
of
sharp
stones
where
ancient
ilus
lies
and
forth
the
people
flock
as
throng
as
flies
that
buzz
about
the
in
spring
when
life
awakens
under
april
skies
and
birds
from
dawning
into
twilight
sing
xxxviii
then
helen
through
the
camp
was
driven
and
thrust
till
even
the
trojan
women
cried
in
glee
ah
where
is
she
in
whom
thou
thy
trust
the
queen
of
love
and
laughter
where
is
she
behold
the
last
gift
that
she
giveth
thee
thou
of
the
many
loves
to
die
alone
and
round
thy
flesh
for
robes
of
price
to
be
the
cold
raiment
of
sharp
stone
xxxix
ah
slowly
through
that
trodden
field
and
bare
they
pass
where
scarce
the
daffodil
might
spring
for
war
had
wasted
all
but
in
the
air
high
overhead
the
mounting
lark
did
sing
then
all
the
army
gather
in
a
ring
round
helen
round
their
torment
trapp
at
last
and
many
took
up
mighty
stones
to
fling
from
shards
and
flints
on
ilus
barrow
cast
xl
then
menelaus
to
the
people
spoke
and
swift
his
wing
words
came
as
whirling
snow
oh
ye
that
overlong
have
borne
the
yoke
behold
the
very
fountain
of
your
woe
for
her
ye
left
your
dear
homes
long
ago
on
argive
valley
or
boeotian
plain
but
now
the
black
ships
rot
from
stern
to
prow
who
knows
if
ye
shall
see
your
own
again
xli
ay
and
if
home
ye
win
ye
yet
may
find
ye
that
the
winds
waft
and
the
waters
bear
to
argos
ye
are
quite
gone
out
of
mind
your
fathers
dear
and
old
dishonour
there
your
children
deem
you
dead
and
will
not
share
their
lands
with
you
on
mainland
or
on
isle
strange
men
are
wooing
now
the
women
fair
and
love
doth
lightly
woman
heart
beguile
xlii
these
sorrows
hath
this
woman
wrought
alone
so
fall
upon
her
straightway
that
she
die
and
clothe
her
beauty
in
a
cloak
of
stone
he
spake
and
truly
deem
to
hear
her
cry
and
see
the
sharp
flints
straight
and
deadly
fly
but
each
man
stood
and
mused
on
helen
face
and
her
beauty
brought
so
nigh
on
that
bleak
plain
within
that
ruin
place
lxiii
and
as
in
far
off
days
that
were
to
be
the
sense
of
their
own
sin
did
men
constrain
that
they
must
leave
the
sinful
woman
free
who
by
their
law
had
verily
been
slain
so
helen
beauty
made
their
anger
vain
and
one
by
one
his
gather
flints
let
fall
and
like
men
shamed
they
stole
across
the
plain
back
to
the
swift
ships
and
their
festival
xliv
but
menelaus
look
on
her
and
said
hath
no
man
then
condemn
thee
is
there
none
to
shed
thy
blood
for
all
that
thou
hast
shed
to
wreak
on
thee
the
wrongs
that
thou
hast
done
nay
as
mine
own
soul
liveth
there
is
one
that
will
not
set
thy
barren
beauty
free
but
slay
thee
to
poseidon
and
the
sun
before
a
ship
achaian
takes
the
sea
xlv
therewith
he
drew
his
sharp
sword
from
his
thigh
as
one
intent
to
slay
her
but
behold
a
sudden
marvel
shone
across
the
sky
a
cloud
of
rosy
fire
a
flood
of
gold
and
aphrodite
came
from
forth
the
fold
of
wondrous
mist
and
sudden
at
her
feet
lotus
and
crocus
on
the
trampled
wold
brake
and
the
slender
hyacinth
was
sweet
xlvi
then
fell
the
point
that
never
bloodless
fell
when
spear
bit
harness
in
the
battle
din
for
aphrodite
spake
and
like
a
spell
wrought
her
sweet
voice
persuasive
till
within
his
heart
there
lived
no
memory
of
sin
no
thirst
for
vengeance
more
but
all
grew
plain
and
wrath
was
molten
in
desire
to
win
the
golden
heart
of
helen
once
again
xlvii
then
aphrodite
vanish
as
the
day
passes
and
leaves
the
darkling
earth
behind
and
overhead
the
april
sky
was
grey
but
helen
arms
about
her
lord
were
twined
and
his
round
her
as
clingingly
and
kind
as
when
sweet
vines
and
ivy
in
the
spring
join
their
glad
leaves
nor
tempests
may
unbind
the
woven
boughs
so
lovingly
they
cling
xlviii
noon
long
was
but
sacred
night
beheld
them
not
upon
the
ilian
shore

for
about
the
waning
of
the
light
their
swift
ships
wander
on
the
waters
hoar
nor
stay
they
the
olympians
to
adore
so
eagerly
they
left
that
cursed
land

many
a
toil
and
tempests
great
and
sore
befell
them
ere
they
won
the
argive

to
cyprus

came

many
a
ship
and
many
a
man
they
lost
and
perish
many
a
precious
thing
while
bare
before
the
stormy
north
they
ran
and
further
far
than
when
their
quest
began
from
argos
did
they
seem
a
weary
while
becalm
in
sultry
seas
egyptian
a
long
day
voyage
from
the
mouths
of
nile
but
there
the
gods
had
pity
on
them
and
there
the
ancient
proteus
taught
them
how
to
flee
from
that
so
distant
deep
the
fowls
of
air
scarce
in
one
year
can
measure
out
that
sea
yet
first
within
aegyptus
must
they
be
and
hecatombs
must
offer
quickly
then
the
gods
abated
of
their
jealousy
wherewith
they
scourge
the
negligence
of
men
li
and
strong
and
fair
the
south
wind
blew
and
fleet
their
voyaging
so
merrily
they
fled
to
win
that
haven
where
the
waters
sweet
of
clear
eurotas
with
the
brine
are
wed
and
swift
their
chariots
and
their
horses
sped
to
pleasant
lacedaemon
lying
low
grey
in
the
shade
of
sunset
but
the
head
of
tall
taygetus
like
fire
did
glow

what
but
this
is
sweet
at
last

win
the
fields

not

note
in
this
story
in
rhyme
of
the
fortunes
of
helen
the
theory
that
she
was
an
unwilling
victim
of
the
gods
has
been
preferred
many
of
the
descriptions
of
manners
are
versified
from
the
iliad
and
the
odyssey
the
description
of
the
events
after
the
death
of
hector
and
the
account
of
the
sack
of
troy
is
chiefly
borrowed
from
quintus
smyrnaeus
the
character
and
history
of
helen
of
troy
have
been
conceived
of
in
very
different
ways
by
poets
and
mythologists
in
attempting
to
trace
the
chief
current
of
ancient
traditions
about
helen
we
can
not
really
get
further
back
than
the
homeric
poems
the
iliad
and
odyssey
philological
conjecture
may
assure
us
that
helen
like
most
of
the
characters
of
old
romance
is
merely
the
dawn
or
light
or
some
other
bright
being
carried
away
by
paris
who
represents
night
or
winter
or
the
cloud
or
some
other
power
of
darkness
without
discussing
these
ideas
it
may
be
said
that
the
greek
poets
at
all
events
before
allegorical
explanations
of
mythology
came
in
about
five
hundred
years
before
christ
regarded
helen
simply
as
a
woman
of
wonderful
beauty
homer
was
not
thinking
of
the
dawn
or
the
cloud
when
he
described
helen
among
the
elders
on
the
ilian
walls
or
repeated
her
lament
over
the
dead
body
of
hector
the
homeric
poems
are
our
oldest
literary
documents
about
helen
but
it
is
probable
enough
that
the
poet
has
modified
and
purified
more
ancient
traditions
which
still
survive
in
various
fragments
of
greek
legend
in
homer
helen
is
always
the
daughter
of
zeus
isocrates
tells
us
helena
b
that
while
many
of
the
demigods
were
children
of
zeus
he
thought
the
paternity
of
none
of
his
daughters
worth
claiming
save
that
of
helen
only
in
homer
then
helen
is
the
daughter
of
zeus
but
homer
says
nothing
of
the
famous
legend
which
makes
zeus
assume
the
form
of
a
swan
to
woo
the
mother
of
helen
unhomeric
as
this
myth
is
we
may
regard
it
as
extremely
ancient
very
similar
tales
of
pursuit
and
metamorphosis
for
amatory
or
other
purposes
among
the
old
legends
of
wales
and
in
the
arabian
nights
as
well
as
in
the
myths
of
australians
and
red
indians
again
the
belief
that
different
families
of
mankind
descend
from
animals
as
from
the
swan
or
from
gods
in
the
shape
of
animals
is
found
in
every
quarter
of
the
world
and
among
the
rudest
races
many
australian
natives
of
claim
descent
like
the
royal
house
of
sparta
from
the
swan
the
greek
myths
hesitated
as
to
whether
nemesis
or
leda
was
the
bride
of
the
swan
homer
only
mentions
leda
among
the
wives
and
daughters
of
mighty
men
whose
ghosts
odysseus
beheld
in
hades
and
i
saw
leda
the
famous
bedfellow
of
tyndareus
who
bare
to
tyndareus
two
sons
hardy
of
heart
castor
tamer
of
steeds
and
the
boxer
polydeuces
these
heroes
helen
in
the
iliad
iii
describes
as
her
mother
sons
thus
if
homer
has
any
distinct
view
on
the
subject
he
holds
that
leda
is
the
mother
of
helen
by
zeus
of
the
dioscuri
by
tyndareus
greek
ideas
as
to
the
character
of
helen
varied
with
the
various
moods
of
greek
literature
homer
own
ideas
about
his
heroine
are
probably
best
expressed
in
the
words
with
which
priam
greets
her
as
she
appears
among
the
assembled
elders
who
are
watching
the
argive
heroes
from
the
wall
of
troy
in
nowise
dear
child
do
i
blame
thee
nay
the
gods
are
to
blame
who
have
roused
against
me
the
woful
war
of
the
achaeans
homer
like
priam
throws
the
guilt
of
helen
on
the
gods
but
it
is
not
very
easy
to
understand
exactly
what
he
means
by
saying
the
gods
are
to
blame
in
the
first
place
homer
avoids
the
psychological
problems
in
which
modern
poetry
revels
by
attributing
almost
all
changes
of
the
moods
of
men
to
divine
inspiration
thus
when
achilles
in
a
famous
passage
of
the
first
book
of
the
iliad
puts
up
his
sword
in
the
sheath
and
does
not
slay
agamemnon
homer
assigns
his
repentance
to
the
direct
influence
of
athene
again
he
says
in
the
odyssey
about
clytemnestra
that
she
would
none
of
the
foul
deed
that
is
of
the
love
of
aegisthus
till
the
doom
of
the
gods
bound
her
to
her
ruin
so
far
the
same
excuse
is
made
for
the
murderous
clytemnestra
as
for
the
amiable
helen
again
homer
is
in
the
strictest
sense
and
in
strong
contrast
to
the
greek
tragedians
and
to
virgil
a
chivalrous
poet
it
would
probably
be
impossible
to
find
a
passage
in
which
he
speaks
harshly
or
censoriously
of
the
conduct
of
any
fair
and
noble
lady
the
sordid
treachery
of
eriphyle
who
sold
her
lord
for
gold
wins
for
her
the
epithet
hateful
and
achilles
in
a
moment
of
strong
grief
applies
a
term
of
abhorrence
to
helen
but
homer
is
too
chivalrous
to
judge
the
life
of
any
lady
and
only
shows
the
other
side
of
the
chivalrous
character
its
cruelty
to
persons
not
of
noble
birth
in
describing
the
foul
death
of
the
waiting
women
of
penelope
god
forbid
that
i
should
take
these
women
lives
by
a
clean
death
says
telemachus
odyssey
xxii
so
about
all
their
necks
nooses
were
cast
that
they
might
die
by
the
death
most
pitiful
and
they
writhed
with
their
feet
for
a
little
space
but
for
no
long
while
in
trying
to
understand
estimate
of
helen
therefore
we
must
make
allowance
for
his
theory
of
divine
intervention
and
for
his
chivalrous
judgment
of
ladies
but
there
are
two
passages
in
the
iliad
which
may
be
taken
as
indicating
homer
opinion
that
helen
was
literally
a
victim
an
unwilling
victim
of
aphrodite
and
that
she
was
carried
away
by
force
a
captive
from
lacedaemon
these
passages
are
in
the
iliad
ii
in
the
former
text
nestor
says
let
none
be
eager
to
return
home
ere
he
has
couched
with
a
trojan
wife
and
the
longings
and
sorrows
of
greek
text
it
is
thus
that
gladstone
a
notable
champion
of
helen
would
render
this
passage
and
the
same
interpretation
was
favoured
by
the
ancient
separatists
chorizontes
who
wished
to
prove
that
the
iliad
and
odyssey
were
by
different
authors
but
many
authorities
prefer
to
translate
to
avenge
our
labours
and
sorrows
for
helen
sake
to
avenge
all
that
we
have
endured
in
the
attempt
to
win
back
helen
thus
the
evidence
of
this
passage
is
ambiguous
the
fairer
way
to
seek
for
homer
real
view
of
helen
is
to
examine
all
the
passages
in
which
she
occurs
the
result
will
be
something
like
this
homer
sees
in
helen
a
being
of
the
rarest
personal
charm
and
grace
of
character
a
woman
who
imputes
to
herself
guilt
much
greater
than
the
real
measure
of
her
offence
she
is
ever
gentle
except
with
the
goddess
who
betrayed
her
and
the
unworthy
lover
whose
lot
she
is
compelled
to
share
against
them
her
helpless
anger
breaks
out
in
flashes
of
eloquent
scorn
homer
was
apparently
acquainted
with
the
myth
of
helen
capture
by
theseus
a
myth
illustrated
in
the
decorations
of
the
coffer
of
cypselus
but
we
first
see
helen
the
cause
of
the
war
when
menelaus
and
paris
are
about
to
fight
their
duel
for
her
sake
in
the
tenth
year
of
the
leaguer
iliad
iii
iris
is
sent
to
summon
helen
to
the
walls
she
finds
helen
in
her
chamber
weaving
at
a
mighty
loom
and
embroidering
on
tapestry
the
adventures
of
the
siege
the
battles
of
trojans
and
achaeans
the
message
of
iris
renews
in
helen
heart
a
sweet
desire
for
her
lord
and
her
own
city
and
them
that
begat
her
so
draped
in
silvery
white
helen
goes
with
her
three
maidens
to
the
walls
there
above
the
gate
like
some
king
in
the
old
testament
paris
sits
among
his
counsellors
and
they
are
all
amazed
at
helen
beauty
no
marvel
is
it
that
trojans
and
achaeans
suffer
long
and
weary
toils
for
such
a
woman
so
wondrous
like
to
the
immortal
goddesses
then
priam
assuring
helen
that
he
holds
her
blameless
bids
her
name
to
him
her
kinsfolk
and
the
other
achaean
warriors
in
her
reply
helen
displays
that
grace
of
penitence
which
is
certainly
not
often
found
in
ancient
literature
would
that
evil
death
had
been
my
choice
when
i
followed
thy
son
and
left
my
bridal
bower
and
my
kin
and
my
daughter
dear
and
the
maidens
of
like
age
with
me
agamemnon
she
calls
the
brother
of
me
shameless
alas
that
such
an
one
should
be
she
names
many
of
the
warriors
but
misses
her
brothers
castor
and
polydeuces
own
brothers
of
mine
one
mother
bare
us
either
they
followed
not
from
pleasant
lacedaemon
or
hither
they
followed
in
swift
ships
but
now
they
have
no
heart
to
go
down
into
the
battle
for
dread
of
the
shame
and
many
reproaches
that
are
mine
so
spake
she
but
already
the
earth
did
cover
them
there
in
lacedaemon
in
their
own
dear
country
menelaus
and
paris
fought
out
their
duel
the
trojan
was
discomfited
but
was
rescued
from
death
and
carried
to
helen
bower
by
aphrodite
then
the
goddess
came
in
disguise
to
seek
helen
on
the
wall
and
force
her
back
into
the
arms
of
her
defeated
lover
helen
turned
on
the
goddess
with
an
abruptness
and
a
force
of
sarcasm
and
invective
which
seem
quite
foreign
to
her
gentle
nature
wilt
thou
take
me
further
yet
to
some
city
of
phrygia
or
pleasant
maeonia
if
there
any
man
is
dear
to
thee
nay
go
thyself
and
sit
down
by
paris
and
forswear
the
paths
of
the
gods
but
ever
lament
for
him
and
cherish
him
till
he
make
thee
his
wife
yea
or
perchance
his
slave
but
to
him
will
i
never
go
but
this
anger
of
helen
is
soon
overcome
by
fear
when
the
goddess
in
turn
waxes
wrathful
and
helen
is
literally
driven
by
threats
for
the
daughter
of
zeus
was
afraid
into
the
arms
of
paris
yet
even
so
she
taunts
her
lover
with
his
cowardice
a
cowardice
which
she
never
really
condones
in
the
sixth
book
of
the
iliad
she
has
been
urging
him
to
return
to
the
war
she
then
expresses
her
penitence
to
hector
would
that
the
fury
of
the
wind
had
borne
me
afar
to
the
mountains
or
the
wave
of
the
roaring
sea
ere
ever
these
ill
deeds
were
done
in
this
passage
too
she
prophesies
that
her
fortunes
will
be
greek
text
famous
in
the
songs
good
or
evil
of
men
unborn
in
the
last
book
of
the
iliad
we
meet
helen
once
more
as
she
laments
over
the
dead
body
of
hector
in
all
the
twenty
years
since
i
came
hither
have
i
heard
from
thee
one
taunt
or
one
evil
word
nay
but
if
any
other
rebuked
me
in
the
halls
any
one
of
my
husband
brothers
or
of
their
sisters
or
their
wives
or
the
mother
of
my
husband
but
the
king
was
ever
gentle
to
me
as
a
father
then
wouldst
thou
restrain
them
with
thy
loving
kindness
and
thy
gentle
speech
so
spake
she
weeping
in
the
odyssey
helen
is
once
more
in
lacedaemon
the
honoured
but
still
penitent
wife
of
menelaus
how
they
became
reconciled
an
extremely
difficult
point
in
the
story
there
is
nothing
in
homer
to
tell
us
sir
john
lubbock
has
conjectured
that
in
the
morals
of
the
heroic
age
helen
was
not
really
regarded
as
guilty
she
was
lawfully
married
by
capture
to
paris
unfortunately
for
this
theory
there
is
abundant
proof
that
in
the
heroic
age
wives
were
nominally
for
so
many
cattle
or
given
as
a
reward
for
great
services
there
is
no
sign
of
marriage
by
capture
and
again
marriage
by
capture
is
a
savage
institution
which
applies
to
unmarried
women
not
to
women
already
wedded
as
helen
was
to
menelaus
perhaps
the
oldest
evidence
we
have
for
opinion
about
the
later
relations
of
helen
and
menelaus
is
derived
from
pausanias
description
of
the
chest
of
cypselus
this
ancient
coffer
a
work
of
the
seventh
century
was
still
preserved
at
olympia
in
the
time
of
pausanias
on
one
of
the
bands
of
cedar
or
of
ivory
was
represented
pausanias
menelaus
with
a
sword
in
his
hand
rushing
on
to
kill
helen
clearly
at
the
sacking
of
ilios
how
menelaus
passed
from
a
desire
to
kill
helen
to
his
absolute
complacency
in
the
odyssey
homer
does
not
tell
us
according
to
a
statement
attributed
to
stesichorus
the
army
of
the
achaeans
purposed
to
stone
helen
but
was
overawed
and
compelled
to
relent
by
her
extraordinary
beauty
when
they
beheld
her
they
cast
down
their
stones
on
the
ground
it
may
be
conjectured
that
the
reconciliation
followed
this
futile
attempt
at
punishing
a
daughter
of
zeus
homer
then
leaves
us
without
information
about
the
adventures
of
helen
between
the
sack
of
tiny
and
the
reconciliation
with
menelaus
he
hints
that
she
was
married
to
deiphobus
after
the
death
of
paris
and
alludes
to
the
tradition
that
she
mimicked
the
voices
of
the
wives
of
the
heroes
and
so
nearly
tempted
them
to
leave
their
ambush
in
the
wooden
horse
but
in
the
fourth
book
of
the
odyssey
when
telemachus
visits
lacedaemon
he
finds
helen
the
honoured
wife
of
menelaus
rich
in
the
marvellous
gifts
bestowed
on
her
in
her
wanderings
from
troy
by
the
princes
of
egypt
while
yet
he
pondered
these
things
in
his
mind
and
in
his
heart
helen
came
forth
from
her
fragrant
vaulted
chamber
like
artemis
of
the
golden
arrows
and
with
her
came
adraste
and
set
for
her
the
chair
and
alcippe
bare
a
rug
of
soft
wool
and
phylo
bare
a
silver
basket
which
alcandre
gave
her
the
wife
of
polybus
who
dwelt
in
thebes
of
egypt
where
is
the
chiefest
store
of
wealth
in
the
houses
he
gave
two
silver
baths
to
menelaus
and
tripods
twain
and
ten
talents
of
gold
and
besides
all
this
his
wife
bestowed
on
helen
lovely
gifts
a
golden
distaff
did
she
give
and
a
silver
basket
with
wheels
beneath
and
the
rims
thereof
were
finished
with
gold
this
it
was
that
the
handmaid
phylo
bare
and
set
beside
her
filled
with
dressed
yarn
and
across
it
was
laid
a
distaff
charged
with
wool
of
violet
blue
so
helen
sat
her
down
in
the
chair
and
beneath
was
a
footstool
for
the
feet
when
the
host
and
guests
begin
to
weep
the
ready
tears
of
the
heroic
age
over
the
sorrows
of
the
past
and
dread
of
the
dim
future
helen
comforts
them
with
a
magical
potion
then
helen
daughter
of
zeus
turned
to
new
thoughts
presently
she
cast
a
drug
into
the
wine
whereof
they
drank
a
drug
to
lull
all
pain
and
anger
and
bring
forgetfulness
of
every
sorrow
whoso
should
drink
a
draught
thereof
when
it
is
mingled
in
the
bowl
on
that
day
he
would
let
no
tear
fall
down
his
cheeks
not
though
his
mother
and
his
father
died
not
though
men
slew
his
brother
or
dear
son
with
the
sword
before
his
face
and
his
own
eyes
beheld
it
medicines
of
such
virtue
and
so
helpful
had
the
daughter
of
zeus
which
polydamna
the
wife
of
thon
had
given
her
a
woman
of
egypt
where
earth
the
yields
herbs
in
greatest
plenty
many
that
are
healing
in
the
cup
and
many
baneful
so
telemachus
was
kindly
entertained
by
helen
and
menelaus
and
when
he
left
them
it
was
not
without
a
gift
and
helen
stood
by
the
coffers
wherein
were
her
robes
of
curious
needlework
which
she
herself
had
wrought
then
helen
the
fair
lady
lifted
one
and
brought
it
out
the
widest
and
most
beautifully
embroidered
of
all
and
it
shone
like
a
star
and
lay
far
beneath
the
rest
presently
we
read
helen
of
the
fair
face
came
up
with
the
robe
in
her
hands
and
spake
i
too
give
thee
this
gift
dear
child
a
memorial
of
the
hands
of
helen
for
thy
bride
to
wear
upon
the
day
of
thy
desire
even
of
thy
marriage
but
meanwhile
let
it
lie
with
thy
mother
in
her
chamber
and
may
joy
go
with
thee
to
thy
house
and
thine
own
country
helen
last
words
in
homer
are
words
of
good
omen
her
prophecy
to
telemachus
that
odysseus
shall
return
home
after
long
wanderings
and
take
vengeance
on
the
rovers
we
see
helen
no
more
but
homer
does
not
leave
us
in
doubt
as
to
her
later
fortunes
he
quotes
the
prophecy
which
proteus
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
delivered
to
menelaus
but
thou
menelaus
son
of
zeus
art
not
ordained
to
die
and
meet
thy
fate
in
argos
the
of
horses
but
the
deathless
gods
will
convey
thee
to
the
elysian
plain
and
the
world
end
where
is
rhadamanthus
of
the
fair
hair
where
life
is
easiest
for
men
no
snow
is
there
nor
yet
great
storm
nor
any
rain
but
alway
ocean
sendeth
forth
the
breeze
of
the
shrill
west
to
blow
cool
on
men
yea
for
thou
hast
helen
to
wife
and
thereby
they
deem
thee
to
be
son
of
zeus
we
must
believe
with
isocrates
that
helen
was
translated
with
her
lord
to
that
field
of
elysium
where
falls
not
hail
or
rain
or
any
snow
this
version
of
the
end
of
helen
history
we
have
adopted
but
many
other
legends
were
known
in
greece
pausanias
tells
us
that
in
a
battle
between
the
crotoniats
and
the
locrians
one
leonymus
charged
the
empty
space
in
the
locrian
line
which
was
entrusted
to
the
care
of
the
ghost
of
aias
leonymus
was
wounded
by
the
invisible
spear
of
the
hero
and
could
not
be
healed
of
the
hurt
the
delphian
oracle
bade
him
seek
the
isle
of
leuke
in
the
euxine
sea
where
aias
would
appear
to
him
and
heal
him
when
leonymus
returned
from
leuke
he
told
how
achilles
dwelt
there
with
his
ancient
comrades
and
how
he
was
now
wedded
to
helen
of
troy
yet
the
local
tradition
of
lacedaemon
showed
the
sepulchre
of
helen
in
therapnae
according
to
a
rhodian
legend
adopted
by
the
author
of
the
epic
of
hades
helen
was
banished
from
sparta
by
the
sons
of
menelaus
came
wandering
to
rhodes
and
was
there
strangled
by
the
servants
of
the
queen
polyxo
who
thus
avenged
the
death
of
her
husband
at
troy
it
is
certain
as
we
learn
both
from
herodotus
vi
and
from
isocrates
that
helen
was
worshipped
in
therapnae
in
the
days
of
ariston
the
king
a
deformed
child
was
daily
brought
by
her
nurse
to
the
shrine
of
helen
and
it
is
said
that
as
the
nurse
was
leaving
the
shrine
a
woman
appeared
unto
her
and
asked
what
she
bore
in
her
arms
who
said
she
bore
a
child
then
the
woman
said
show
it
to
me
which
the
nurse
refused
for
the
parents
of
the
child
had
forbidden
that
she
should
be
seen
of
any
but
the
woman
straitly
commanding
that
the
child
should
be
shown
and
the
other
beholding
her
eagerness
at
length
the
nurse
showed
the
child
and
the
woman
caressed
its
face
and
said
she
shall
be
the
fairest
woman
in
sparta
and
from
that
day
the
fashion
of
its
countenance
was
changed
and
the
child
became
the
fairest
of
all
the
spartan
women
it
is
a
characteristic
of
greek
literature
that
with
the
rise
of
democracy
the
old
epic
conception
of
the
ancient
heroes
altered
we
can
scarcely
recognize
the
odysseus
of
homer
in
the
odysseus
of
sophocles
the
kings
are
regarded
by
the
tragedians
with
some
of
the
distrust
and
hatred
which
the
unconstitutional
tyrants
of
athens
had
aroused
just
as
the
later
de
of
france
the
poems
written
in
an
age
of
feudal
opposition
to
central
authority
degraded
heroes
like
charles
so
rhetorical
republican
and
sophistical
greece
put
its
quibbles
into
the
lips
of
agamemnon
and
helen
and
slandered
the
stainless
and
fearless
patroclus
and
achilles
the
helen
of
euripides
in
the
troades
is
a
pettifogging
sophist
who
pleads
her
cause
to
menelaus
with
rhetorical
artifice
in
the
helena
again
euripides
quite
deserts
the
homeric
traditions
and
adopts
the
late
myths
which
denied
that
helen
ever
went
to
troy
she
remained
in
egypt
and
achaeans
and
trojans
fought
for
a
mere
shadow
formed
by
the
gods
out
of
clouds
and
wind
in
the
cyclops
of
euripides
a
satirical
drama
the
cynical
giant
is
allowed
to
speak
of
helen
in
a
strain
of
coarse
banter
perhaps
the
essay
of
isocrates
on
helen
may
be
regarded
as
a
kind
of
answer
to
the
attacks
of
several
speakers
in
the
works
of
the
tragedians
isocrates
defends
helen
simply
on
the
plea
of
her
beauty
to
heracles
zeus
gave
strength
to
helen
beauty
which
naturally
rules
over
even
strength
itself
beauty
he
declares
the
gods
themselves
consider
the
noblest
thing
in
the
world
as
the
goddesses
showed
when
they
contended
for
the
prize
of
loveliness
and
so
marvellous
says
isocrates
was
the
beauty
of
helen
that
for
her
glory
zeus
did
not
spare
his
beloved
son
sarpedon
and
thetis
saw
achilles
die
and
the
dawn
bewailed
her
memnon
beauty
has
raised
more
mortals
to
immortality
than
all
the
other
virtues
together
and
that
helen
is
now
a
goddess
isocrates
proves
by
the
fact
that
the
sacrifices
offered
to
her
in
therapnae
are
such
as
are
given
not
to
heroes
but
to
immortal
gods
when
rome
took
up
the
legends
of
greece
she
did
so
in
no
chivalrous
spirit
few
poets
are
less
chivalrous
than
virgil
no
hero
has
less
of
chivalry
than
his
pious
and
tearful
aeneas
in
the
second
book
of
the
aeneid
the
pious
one
finds
helen
hiding
in
the
shrine
of
vesta
and
determines
to
slay
the
common
curse
of
troy
and
of
her
own
country
there
is
no
glory
he
admits
in
murdering

hundreds
of
years
later
helen
found
a
worthier
poet
in
quintus
smyrnaeus
who
in
a
late
age
sang
the
of
greek
epic
minstrelsy
it
is
thus
that
in
the
fourth
century
quintus
describes
helen
as
she
is
led
with
the
captive
women
of
ilios
to
the
ships
of
the
achaeans
now
helen
lamented
not
but
shame
dwelt
in
her
dark
eyes
and
reddened
her
lovely
cheeks
while
around
her
the
people
marvelled
as
they
beheld
the
flawless
grace
and
winsome
beauty
of
the
woman
and
none
dared
upbraid
her
with
secret
taunt
or
open
rebuke
nay
as
she
had
been
a
goddess
they
beheld
her
gladly
for
dear
and
desired
was
she
in
their
sight
and
as
when
their
own
country
appeareth
to
men
long
wandering
on
the
sea
and
they
being
escaped
from
death
and
the
deep
gladly
put
forth
their
hands
to
greet
their
own
native
place
even
so
all
the
danaans
were
glad
at
the
sight
of
her
and
had
no
more
memory
of
all
their
woful
toil
and
the
din
of
war
such
a
spirit
did
cytherea
put
into
their
hearts
out
of
favour
to
fair
helen
and
father
zeus
thus
quintus
makes
amends
for
the
trivial
verses
in
which
coluthus
describes
the
flight
of
a
frivolous
helen
with
an
effeminate
paris
to
follow
the
fortunes
of
helen
through
the
middle
ages
would
demand
much
space
and
considerable
research
the
poets
who
read
dares
phrygius
believed
with
the
scholar
of
faustus
that
helen
of
greece
was
the
admirablest
lady
that
ever
lived
when
english
poetry
first
found
the
secret
of
perfect
music
her
sweetest
numbers
were
offered
by
marlowe
at
the
shrine
of
helen
the
speech
of
faustus
is
almost
too
hackneyed
to
be
quoted
and
altogether
too
beautiful
to
be
omitted
was
this
the
face
that
launched
a
thousand
ships
and
burnt
the
topless
towers
of
ilium
sweet
helen
make
me
immortal
with
a
kiss
her
lips
suck
forth
my
soul
see
where
it
flies
come
helen
come
give
me
my
soul
again
here
will
i
dwell
for
heaven
is
in
those
lips
and
all
is
dross
that
is
not
helena
oh
thou
art
fairer
than
the
evening
air
clad
in
the
beauty
of
a
thousand
stars
the
loves
of
faustus
and
helen
are
readily
allegorized
into
the
passion
of
the
renaissance
for
classical
beauty
the
passion
to
which
all
that
is
not
beauty
seemed
very
dross
this
is
the
idea
of
the
second
part
of
faust
in
which
helen
once
more
became
as
she
prophesied
in
the
iliad
a
song
in
the
mouths
of
later
men
almost
her
latest
apparition
in
english
poetry
is
in
the
hellenics
of
landor
the
sweetness
of
the
character
of
helen
the
tragedy
of
the
death
of
corythus
by
the
hand
of
his
father
paris
and
the
omnipotence
of
beauty
and
charm
which
triumph
over
the
wrath
of
menelaus
are
the
subjects
of
landor
verse
but
helen
as
a
woman
has
hardly
found
a
nobler
praise
in
three
thousand
years
than
helen
as
a
child
has
received
from
swinburne
in
atalanta
in
calydon
meleager
is
the
speaker
even
such
for
sailing
hither
i
saw
far
hence
and
where
eurotas
hollows
his
moist
rock
nigh
sparta
with
a
stream
even
such
i
saw
their
sisters
one
the
little
helen
and
less
fair
than
she
fair
clytemnestra
grave
as
pasturing
fawns
who
feed
and
fear
some
arrow
but
at
whiles
as
one
smitten
with
love
or
wrung
with
joy
she
laughs
and
lightens
with
her
eyes
and
then
weeps
whereat
helen
having
laughed
weeps
too
and
the
other
chides
her
and
she
being
chid
speaks
naught
but
cheeks
and
lips
and
eyelids
kisses
her
laughing
so
fare
they
as
in
their
bloomless
bud
and
full
of
unblown
life
the
blood
of
gods
there
is
all
the
irony
of
fate
in
althaeas
reply
sweet
days
befall
them
and
good
loves
and
lords
tender
and
temperate
honours
of
the
hearths
peace
and
a
perfect
life
and
blameless
bed
