hero
and
leander
by
christopher
marlowe
first
sestiad
on
hellespont
guilty
of
blood
in
view
and
opposite
two
cities
stood
disjoined
by
neptune
might
the
one
abydos
the
other
sestos
hight
at
sestos
hero
dwelt
hero
the
fair
whom
young
apollo
courted
for
her
hair
and
offered
as
a
dower
his
burning
throne
where
she
should
sit
for
men
to
gaze
upon
the
outside
of
her
garments
were
of
lawn
the
lining
purple
silk
with
gilt
stars
drawn
her
wide
sleeves
green
and
bordered
with
a
grove
where
venus
in
her
naked
glory
strove
to
please
the
careless
and
disdainful
eyes
of
proud
adonis
that
before
her
lies
her
kirtle
blue
whereon
was
many
a
stain
made
with
the
blood
of
wretched
lovers
slain
upon
her
head
she
ware
a
myrtle
wreath
from
whence
her
veil
reached
to
the
ground
beneath
her
veil
was
artificial
flowers
and
leaves
whose
workmanship
both
man
and
beast
deceives
many
would
praise
the
sweet
smell
as
she
passed
when
was
the
odour
which
her
breath
forth
cast
and
there
for
honey
bees
have
sought
in
vain
and
beat
from
thence
have
lighted
there
again
about
her
neck
hung
chains
of
pebblestone
which
lightened
by
her
neck
like
diamonds
shone
she
ware
no
gloves
for
neither
sun
nor
wind
would
burn
or
parch
her
hands
but
to
her
mind
or
warm
or
cool
them
for
they
took
delight
to
play
upon
those
hands
they
were
so
white
buskins
of
shells
all
silvered
used
she
and
branched
with
blushing
coral
to
the
knee
where
sparrows
perched
of
hollow
pearl
and
gold
such
as
the
world
would
wonder
to
behold
those
with
sweet
water
oft
her
handmaid
fills
which
as
she
went
would
chirrup
through
the
bills
some
say
for
her
the
fairest
cupid
pined
and
looking
in
her
face
was
strooken
blind
but
this
is
true
so
like
was
one
the
other
as
he
imagined
hero
was
his
mother
and
oftentimes
into
her
bosom
flew
about
her
naked
neck
his
bare
arms
threw
and
laid
his
childish
head
upon
her
breast
and
with
still
panting
rocked
there
took
his
rest
so
lovely
fair
was
hero
venus
nun
as
nature
wept
thinking
she
was
undone
because
she
took
more
from
her
than
she
left
and
of
such
wondrous
beauty
her
bereft
therefore
in
sign
her
treasure
suffered
wrack
since
hero
time
hath
half
the
world
been
black
amorous
leander
beautiful
and
young
whose
tragedy
divine
musaeus
sung
dwelt
at
abydos
since
him
dwelt
there
none
for
whom
succeeding
times
make
greater
moan
his
dangling
tresses
that
were
never
shorn
had
they
been
cut
and
unto
colchos
borne
would
have
allured
the
youth
of
greece
to
hazard
more
than
for
the
golden
fleece
fair
cynthia
wished
his
arms
might
be
her
sphere
grief
makes
her
pale
because
she
moves
not
there
his
body
was
as
straight
as
circe
wand
jove
might
have
sipped
out
nectar
from
his
hand
even
as
delicious
meat
is
to
the
taste
so
was
his
neck
in
touching
and
surpassed
the
white
of
pelop
shoulder
i
could
tell
ye
how
smooth
his
breast
was
and
how
white
his
belly
and
whose
immortal
fingers
did
imprint
that
heavenly
path
with
many
a
curious
dint
that
runs
along
his
back
but
my
rude
pen
can
hardly
blazon
forth
the
loves
of
men
much
less
of
powerful
gods
let
it
suffice
that
my
slack
muse
sings
of
leander
eyes
those
orient
cheeks
and
lips
exceeding
his
that
leaped
into
the
water
for
a
kiss
of
his
own
shadow
and
despising
many
died
ere
he
could
enjoy
the
love
of
any
had
wild
hippolytus
leander
seen
enamoured
of
his
beauty
had
he
been
his
presence
made
the
rudest
peasant
melt
that
in
the
vast
uplandish
country
dwelt
the
barbarous
thracian
soldier
moved
with
nought
was
moved
with
him
and
for
his
favour
sought
some
swore
he
was
a
maid
in
man
attire
for
in
his
looks
were
all
that
men
desire
a
pleasant
smiling
cheek
a
speaking
eye
a
brow
for
love
to
banquet
royally
and
such
as
knew
he
was
a
man
would
say
leander
thou
art
made
for
amorous
play
why
art
thou
not
in
love
and
loved
of
all
though
thou
be
fair
yet
be
not
thine
own
thrall
the
men
of
wealthy
sestos
every
year
for
his
sake
whom
their
goddess
held
so
dear
adonis
kept
a
solemn
feast
thither
resorted
many
a
wandering
guest
to
meet
their
loves
such
as
had
none
at
all
came
lovers
home
from
this
great
festival
for
every
street
like
to
a
firmament
glistered
with
breathing
stars
who
where
they
went
frighted
the
melancholy
earth
which
deemed
eternal
heaven
to
burn
for
so
it
seemed
as
if
another
phaeton
had
got
the
guidance
of
the
sun
rich
chariot
but
far
above
the
loveliest
hero
shined
and
stole
away
th
enchanted
gazer
mind
for
like
sea
nymphs
enveigling
harmony
so
was
her
beauty
to
the
standers
by
nor
that
pale
and
star
when
yawning
dragons
draw
her
thirling
car
from
latmus
mount
up
to
the
gloomy
sky
where
crowned
with
blazing
light
and
majesty
she
proudly
sits
more
overrules
the
flood
than
she
the
hearts
of
those
that
near
her
stood
even
as
when
gaudy
nymphs
pursue
the
chase
wretched
ixion
shaggy
footed
race
incensed
with
savage
heat
gallop
amain
from
steep
mountains
to
the
plain
so
ran
the
people
forth
to
gaze
upon
her
and
all
that
viewed
her
were
enamoured
on
her
and
as
in
fury
of
a
dreadful
fight
their
fellows
being
slain
or
put
to
flight
poor
soldiers
stand
with
fear
of
death
dead
strooken
so
at
her
presence
all
surprised
and
tooken
await
the
sentence
of
her
scornful
eyes
he
whom
she
favours
lives
the
other
dies
there
might
you
see
one
sigh
another
rage
and
some
their
violent
passions
to
assuage
compile
sharp
satires
but
alas
too
late
for
faithful
love
will
never
turn
to
hate
and
many
seeing
great
princes
were
denied
pin
as
they
went
and
thinking
on
her
died
on
this
feast
day
o
cursed
day
and
hour
went
hero
thorough
sestos
from
her
tower
to
venus
temple
where
unhappily
as
after
chanced
they
did
each
other
spy
so
fair
a
church
as
this
had
venus
none
the
walls
were
of
discoloured
jasper
stone
wherein
was
proteus
carved
and
a
lively
vine
of
green
sea
agate
spread
where
by
one
hand
lightheaded
bacchus
hung
and
with
the
other
wine
from
grapes
out
wrung
of
crystal
shining
fair
the
pavement
was
the
town
of
sestos
called
it
venus
glass
there
might
you
see
the
gods
in
sundry
shapes
committing
heady
riots
incest
rapes
for
know
that
underneath
this
radiant
floor
was
danae
statue
in
a
brazen
tower
jove
slyly
stealing
from
his
sister
bed
to
dally
with
idalian
ganymede
and
for
his
love
europa
bellowing
loud
and
tumbling
with
the
rainbow
in
a
cloud
blood
quaffing
mars
heaving
the
iron
net
which
limping
vulcan
and
his
cyclops
set
love
kindling
fire
to
burn
such
towns
as
troy
sylvanus
weeping
for
the
lovely
boy
that
now
is
turned
into
a
cypress
tree
under
whose
shade
the
wood
gods
love
to
be
and
in
the
midst
a
silver
altar
stood
there
hero
sacrificing
turtle
blood
vailed
to
the
ground
vailing
her
eyelids
close
and
modestly
they
opened
as
she
rose
thence
flew
love
arrow
with
the
golden
head
and
thus
leander
was
enamoured
stone
still
he
stood
and
evermore
he
gazed
till
with
the
fire
that
from
his
countenance
blazed
relenting
hero
gentle
heart
was
strook
such
force
and
virtue
hath
an
amorous
look
it
lies
not
in
our
power
to
love
or
hate
for
will
in
us
is
overruled
by
fate
when
two
are
stripped
long
ere
the
course
begin
we
wish
that
one
should
lose
the
other
win
and
one
especially
do
we
affect
of
two
gold
ingots
like
in
each
respect
the
reason
no
man
knows
let
it
suffice
what
we
behold
is
censured
by
our
eyes
where
both
deliberate
the
love
is
slight
who
ever
loved
that
loved
not
at
first
sight
he
kneeled
but
unto
her
devoutly
prayed
chaste
hero
to
herself
thus
softly
said
were
i
the
saint
he
worships
i
would
hear
him
and
as
she
spake
those
words
came
somewhat
near
him
he
started
up
she
blushed
as
one
ashamed
wherewith
leander
much
more
was
inflamed
he
touched
her
hand
in
touching
it
she
trembled
love
deeply
grounded
hardly
is
dissembled
these
lovers
parleyed
by
the
touch
of
hands
true
love
is
mute
and
oft
amazed
stands
thus
while
dumb
signs
their
yielding
hearts
entangled
the
air
with
sparks
of
living
fire
was
spangled
and
night
deep
drenched
in
misty
acheron
heaved
up
her
head
and
half
the
world
upon
breathed
darkness
forth
dark
night
is
cupid
day
and
now
begins
leander
to
display
love
holy
fire
with
words
with
sighs
and
tears
which
like
sweet
music
entered
hero
ears
and
yet
at
every
word
she
turned
aside
and
always
cut
him
off
as
he
replied
at
last
like
to
a
bold
sharp
sophister
with
cheerful
hope
thus
he
accosted
her
fair
creature
let
me
speak
without
offence
i
would
my
rude
words
had
the
influence
to
lead
thy
thoughts
as
thy
fair
looks
do
mine
then
shouldst
thou
be
his
prisoner
who
is
thine
be
not
unkind
and
fair
misshapen
stuff
are
of
behaviour
boisterous
and
rough
o
shun
me
not
but
hear
me
ere
you
go
god
knows
i
can
not
force
love
as
you
do
my
words
shall
be
as
spotless
as
my
youth
full
of
simplicity
and
naked
truth
this
sacrifice
whose
sweet
perfume
descending
from
venus
altar
to
your
footsteps
bending
doth
testify
that
you
exceed
her
far
to
whom
you
offer
and
whose
nun
you
are
why
should
you
worship
her
her
you
surpass
as
much
as
sparkling
diamonds
flaring
glass
a
diamond
set
in
lead
his
worth
retains
a
heavenly
nymph
beloved
of
human
swains
receives
no
blemish
but
ofttimes
more
grace
which
makes
me
hope
although
i
am
but
base
base
in
respect
of
thee
divine
and
pure
dutiful
service
may
thy
love
procure
and
i
in
duty
will
excel
all
other
as
thou
in
beauty
dost
exceed
love
mother
nor
heaven
nor
thou
were
made
to
gaze
upon
as
heaven
preserves
all
things
so
save
thou
one
a
stately
builded
ship
well
rigged
and
tall
the
ocean
maketh
more
majestical
why
vowest
thou
then
to
live
in
sestos
here
who
on
love
seas
more
glorious
wouldst
appear
like
untuned
golden
strings
all
women
are
which
long
time
lie
untouched
will
harshly
jar
vessels
of
brass
oft
handled
brightly
shine
what
difference
betwixt
the
richest
mine
and
basest
mould
but
use
for
both
not
used
are
of
like
worth
then
treasure
is
abused
when
misers
keep
it
being
put
to
loan
in
time
it
will
return
us
two
for
one
rich
robes
themselves
and
others
do
adorn
neither
themselves
nor
others
if
not
worn
who
builds
a
palace
and
rams
up
the
gate
shall
see
it
ruinous
and
desolate
ah
simple
hero
learn
thyself
to
cherish
lone
women
like
to
empty
houses
perish
less
sins
the
poor
rich
man
that
starves
himself
in
heaping
up
a
mass
of
drossy
pelf
than
such
as
you
his
golden
earth
remains
which
after
his
decease
some
other
gains
but
this
fair
gem
sweet
in
the
loss
alone
when
you
fleet
hence
can
be
bequeathed
to
none
or
if
it
could
down
from
sky
all
heaven
would
come
to
claim
this
legacy
and
with
intestine
broils
the
world
destroy
and
quite
confound
nature
sweet
harmony
well
therefore
by
the
gods
decreed
it
is
we
human
creatures
should
enjoy
that
bliss
one
is
no
number
maids
are
nothing
then
without
the
sweet
society
of
men
wilt
thou
live
single
still
one
shalt
thou
be
though
never
singling
hymen
couple
thee
wild
savages
that
drink
of
running
springs

water
far
excels
all
earthly
things
but
they
that
daily
taste
neat
wine
despise
it
virginity
albeit
some
highly
prize
it
compared
with
marriage
had
you
tried
them
both
differs
as
much
as
wine

water
doth
base
bullion
for
the
stamp
sake
we
allow
even
so
for
men
impression
do
we
you
by
which
alone
our
reverend
fathers
say
women
receive
perfection
every
way
this
idol
which
you
term
virginity
is
neither
essence
subject
to
the
eye
no
nor
to
any
one
exterior
sense
nor
hath
it
any

foolishly

what
virtue

it
that

honour

by
the
deeds
we
do

me
hero
honour
is
not
won
until
some
honourable
deed
be
done
seek
you
for
chastity
immortal
fame
and
know
that
some
have
wronged
diana
name
whose
name
is
it
if
she
be
false
or
not
so
she
be
fair
but
some
vile
tongues
will
blot
but
you
are
fair
ay
me
so
wondrous
fair
so
young
so
gentle
and
so
debonair
as
greece
will
think
if
thus
you
live
alone
some
one
or
other
keeps
you
as
his
own
then
hero
hate
me
not
nor
from
me
fly
to
follow
swiftly
blasting
infamy
perhaps
thy
sacred
priesthood
makes
thee
loath
tell
me
to
whom
thou
that
heedless
oath
to
venus
answered
she
and
as
she
spake
forth
from
those
two
tralucent
cisterns
brake
a
stream
of
liquid
pearl
which
down
her
face
made
paths
whereon
the
gods
might
trace
to
jove
high
court
he
thus
replied
the
rites
in
which
love
beauteous
empress
most
delights
are
banquets
doric
music
midnight
revel
plays
masks
and
all
that
stern
age
counteth
evil
thee
as
a
holy
idiot
doth
she
scorn
for
thou
in
vowing
chastity
hast
sworn
to
rob
her
name
and
honour
and
thereby
a
sin
far
worse
than
perjury
even
sacrilege
against
her
deity
through
regular
and
formal
purity
to
expiate
which
sin
kiss
and
shake
hands
such
sacrifice
as
this
venus
demands
thereat
she
smiled
and
did
deny
him
so
as
put
thereby
yet
might
he
hope
for
moe
which
makes
him
quickly
his
speech
and
her
in
humble
manner
thus
beseech
though
neither
gods
nor
men
may
thee
deserve
yet
for
her
sake
whom
you
have
vowed
to
serve
abandon
fruitless
cold
virginity
the
gentle
queen
of
love
sole
enemy
then
shall
you
most
resemble
venus
nun
when
venus
sweet
rites
are
performed
and
done
pallas
joys
in
single
life
but
pallas
and
your
mistress
are
at
strife
love
hero
then
and
be
not
tyrannous
but
heal
the
heart
that
thou
hast
wounded
thus
nor
stain
thy
youthful
years
with
avarice
fair
fools
delight
to
be
accounted
nice
the
richest
corn
dies
if
it
be
not
reaped
beauty
alone
is
lost
too
warily
kept
these
arguments
he
used
and
many
more
wherewith
she
yielded
that
was
won
before
hero
looks
yielded
but
her
words
made
war
women
are
won
when
they
begin
to
jar
thus
having
swallowed
cupid
golden
hook
the
more
she
strived
the
deeper
was
she
strook
yet
evilly
feigning
anger
strove
she
still
and
would
be
thought
to
grant
against
her
will
so
having
paused
a
while
at
last
she
said
who
taught
thee
rhetoric
to
deceive
a
maid
ay
me
such
words
as
these
should
i
abhor
and
yet
i
like
them
for
the
orator
with
that
leander
stooped
to
have
embraced
her
but
from
his
spreading
arms
away
she
cast
her
and
thus
bespake
him
gentle
youth
forbear
to
touch
the
sacred
garments
which
i
wear
upon
a
rock
and
underneath
a
hill
far
from
the
town
where
all
is
whist
and
still
save
that
the
sea
playing
on
yellow
sand
sends
forth
a
rattling
murmur
to
the
land
whose
sound
allures
the
golden
morpheus
in
silence
of
the
night
to
visit
us
my
turret
stands
and
there
god
knows
i
play
with
venus
swans
and
sparrows
all
the
day
a
dwarfish
beldam
bears
me
company
that
hops
about
the
chamber
where
i
lie
and
spends
the
night
that
might
be
better
spent
in
vain
discourse
and
apish
merriment
come
thither
as
she
spake
this
her
tongue
tripped
for
unawares
come
thither
from
her
slipped
and
suddenly
her
former
colour
changed
and
here
and
there
her
eyes
through
anger
ranged
and
like
a
planet
moving
several
ways
at
one
self
instant
she
poor
soul
assays
loving
not
to
love
at
all
and
every
part
strove
to
resist
the
motions
of
her
heart
and
hands
so
pure
so
innocent
nay
such
as
might
have
made
heaven
stoop
to
have
a
touch
did
she
uphold
to
venus
and
again
vowed
spotless
chastity
but
all
in
vain
cupid
beats
down
her
prayers
with
his
wings
her
vows
above
the
empty
air
he
flings
all
deep
enraged
his
sinewy
bow
he
bent
and
shot
a
shaft
that
burning
from
him
went
wherewith
she
strooken
looked
so
dolefully
as
made
love
sigh
to
see
his
tyranny
and
as
she
wept
her
tears
to
pearl
he
turned
and
wound
them
on
his
arm
and
for
her
mourned
then
towards
the
palace
of
the
destinies
laden
with
languishment
and
grief
he
flies
and
to
those
stern
nymphs
humbly
made
request
both
might
enjoy
each
other
and
be
blest
but
with
a
ghastly
dreadful
countenance
threatening
a
thousand
deaths
at
every
glance
they
answered
love
nor
would
vouchsafe
so
much
as
one
poor
word
their
hate
to
him
was
such
hearken
a
while
and
i
will
tell
you
why
heaven
winged
herald
mercury
the
selfsame
day
that
he
asleep
had
laid
enchanted
argus
spied
a
country
maid
whose
careless
hair
instead
of
pearl
it
glistered
with
dew
as
one
that
seemed
to
scorn
it
her
breath
as
fragrant
as
the
morning
rose
her
mind
pure
and
her
tongue
untaught
to
gloze
yet
proud
she
was
for
lofty
pride
that
dwells
in
towered
courts
is
oft
in
shepherds
cells
and
too
too
well
the
fair
vermilion
knew
and
silver
tincture
of
her
cheeks
that
drew
the
love
of
every
swain
on
her
this
god
enamoured
was
and
with
his
snaky
rod
did
charm
her
nimble
feet
and
made
her
stay
the
while
upon
a
hillock
down
he
lay
and
sweetly
on
his
pipe
began
to
play
and
with
smooth
speech
her
fancy
to
assay
till
in
his
twining
arms
he
locked
her
fast
and
then
he
wooed
with
kisses
and
at
last
as
shepherds
do
her
on
the
ground
he
laid
and
tumbling
in
the
grass
he
often
strayed
beyond
the
bounds
of
shame
in
being
bold
to
eye
those
parts
which
no
eye
should
behold
and
like
an
insolent
commanding
lover
boasting
his
parentage
would
needs
discover
the
way
to
new
elysium
but
she
whose
only
dower
was
her
chastity
having
in
vain
was
now
about
to
cry
and
crave
the
help
of
shepherds
that
were
nigh
herewith
he
stayed
his
fury
and
began
to
give
her
leave
to
rise
away
she
ran
after
went
mercury
who
used
such
cunning
as
she
to
hear
his
tale
left
off
her
running
maids
are
not
won
by
brutish
force
and
might
but
speeches
full
of
pleasure
and
delight
and
knowing
hermes
courted
her
was
glad
that
she
such
loveliness
and
beauty
had
as
could
provoke
his
liking
yet
was
mute
and
neither
would
deny
nor
grant
his
suit
still
vowed
he
love
she
wanting
no
excuse
to
feed
him
with
delays
as
women
use
or
thirsting
after
immortality
all
women
are
ambitious
naturally
imposed
upon
her
lover
such
a
task
as
he
ought
not
perform
nor
yet
she
ask
a
draught
of
flowing
nectar
she
requested
wherewith
the
king
of
gods
and
men
is
feasted
he
ready
to
accomplish
what
she
willed
stole
some
from
hebe
hebe
jove
cup
filled
and
gave
it
to
his
simple
rustic
love
which
being
known
as
what
is
hid
from
jove
he
inly
stormed
and
waxed
more
furious
than
for
the
fire
filched
by
prometheus
and
thrusts
him
down
from
heaven
he
wandering
here
in
mournful
terms
with
sad
and
heavy
cheer
complained
to
cupid
cupid
for
his
sake
to
be
revenged
on

did
undertake
and
those
on
whom
heaven
earth
and
hell
relies
i
mean
the
adamantine
destinies
he
wounds
with
love
and
forced
them
equally
to
dote
upon
deceitful
mercury
they
offered
him
the
deadly
fatal
knife
that
shears
the
slender
threads
of
human
life
at
his
fair
feathered
feet
the
engines
laid
which
th
earth
from
ugly
chaos
den
upweighed
these
he
regarded
not
but
did
entreat
that
jove
usurper
of
his
father
seat
might
presently
be
banished
into
hell
and
aged
saturn
in
olympus
dwell
they
granted
what
he
craved
and
once

saturn

began
their
golden
reign
murder

lust
and

but
long
this

continued
not
as
soon
as
he
his

got
he
reckless
of

did
despise

hermes
had
slept
in

with
ignorance
yet
as
a
punishment
they
added
this
that

should
always
kiss

to

seeing
in
their

the

were

the
end
of
the
first
sestiad
second
sestiad
by
this
sad
hero
with
love
unacquainted
viewing
leander
face
fell
down
and
fainted
he
kissed
her
and
breathed
life
into
her
lips
wherewith
as
one
displeased
away
she
trips
yet
as
she
went
full
often
looked
behind
and
many
poor
excuses
did
she
find
to
linger
by
the
way
and
once
she
stayed
and
would
have
turned
again
but
was
afraid
in
offering
parley
to
be
counted
light
so
on
she
goes
and
in
her
idle
flight
her
painted
fan
of
curled
plumes
let
fall
thinking
to
train
leander
therewithal
he
being
a
novice
knew
not
what
she
meant
but
stayed
and
after
her
a
letter
sent
which
joyful
hero
answered
in
such
sort
as
he
had
hope
to
scale
the
beauteous
fort
wherein
the
liberal
graces
locked
their
wealth
and
therefore
to
her
tower
he
got
by
stealth
wide
open
stood
the
door
he
need
not
climb
and
she
herself
before
the
pointed
time
had
spread
the
board
with
roses
strowed
the
room
and
oft
looked
out
and
mused
he
did
not
come
at
last
he
came
o
who
can
tell
the
greeting
these
greedy
lovers
had
at
their
first
meeting
he
asked
she
gave
and
nothing
was
denied
both
to
each
other
quickly
were
affied
look
how
their
hands
so
were
their
hearts
united
and
what
he
did
she
willingly
requited
sweet
are
the
kisses
the
embracements
sweet
when
like
desires
and
affections
meet
for
from
the
earth
to
heaven
is
cupid
raised
where
fancy
is
in
equal
balance
peised
yet
she
this
rashness
suddenly
repented
and
turned
aside
and
to
herself
lamented
as
if
her
name
and
honour
had
been
wronged
by
being
possessed
of
him
for
whom
she
longed
ay
and
she
wished
albeit
not
from
her
heart
that
he
would
leave
her
turret
and
depart
the
mirthful
god
of
amorous
pleasure
smiled
to
see
how
he
this
captive
nymph
beguiled
for
hitherto
he
did
but
fan
the
fire
and
kept
it
down
that
it
might
mount
the
higher
now
waxed
she
jealous
lest
his
love
abated
fearing
her
own
thoughts
made
her
to
be
hated
therefore
unto
him
hastily
she
goes
and
like
light
salmacis
her
body
throws
upon
his
bosom
where
with
yielding
eyes
she
offers
up
herself
a
sacrifice
to
slake
his
anger
if
he
were
displeased
o
what
god
would
not
therewith
be
appeased
like
aesop
cock
this
jewel
he
enjoyed
and
as
a
brother
with
his
sister
toyed
supposing
nothing
else
was
to
be
done
now
he
her
favour
and
good
will
had
won
but
know
you
not
that
creatures
wanting
sense
by
nature
have
a
mutual
appetence
and
wanting
organs
to
advance
a
step
moved
by
love
force
unto
each
other
lep
much
more
in
subjects
having
intellect
some
hidden
influence
breeds
like
effect
albeit
leander
rude
in
love
and
raw
long
dallying
with
hero
nothing
saw
that
might
delight
him
more
yet
he
suspected
some
amorous
rites
or
other
were
neglected
therefore
unto
his
body
hers
he
clung
she
fearing
on
the
rushes
to
be
flung
strived
with
redoubled
strength
the
more
she
strived
the
more
a
gentle
pleasing
heat
revived
which
taught
him
all
that
elder
lovers
know
and
now
the
same
gan
so
to
scorch
and
glow
as
in
plain
terms
yet
cunningly
he
craved
it
love
always
makes
those
eloquent
that
have
it
she
with
a
kind
of
granting
put
him
by
it
and
ever
as
he
thought
himself
most
nigh
it
like
to
the
tree
of
tantalus
she
fled
and
seeming
lavish
saved
her
maidenhead
king
more
sought
to
keep
his
diadem
than
hero
this
inestimable
gem
above
our
life
we
love
a
steadfast
friend
yet
when
a
token
of
great
worth
we
send
we
often
kiss
it
often
look
thereon
and
stay
the
messenger
that
would
be
gone
no
marvel
then
though
hero
would
not
yield
so
soon
to
part
from
that
she
dearly
held
jewels
being
lost
are
found
again
this
never
lost
but
once
and
once
lost
lost
forever
now
had
the
morn
espied
her
lover
steeds
whereat
she
starts
puts
on
her
purple
weeds
and
red
for
anger
that
he
stayed
so
long
all
headlong
throws
herself
the
clouds
among
and
now
leander
fearing
to
be
missed
embraced
her
suddenly
took
leave
and
kissed
long
was
he
taking
leave
and
loath
to
go
and
kissed
again
as
lovers
use
to
do
sad
hero
wrung
him
by
the
hand
and
wept
saying
let
your
vows
and
promises
be
kept
then
standing
at
the
door
she
turned
about
as
loath
to
see
leander
going
out
and
now
the
sun
that
through
th
horizon
peeps
as
pitying
these
lovers
downward
creeps
so
that
in
silence
of
the
cloudy
night
though
it
was
morning
did
he
take
his
flight
but
what
the
secret
trusty
night
concealed
leander
amorous
habit
soon
revealed
with
cupid
myrtle
was
his
bonnet
crowned
about
his
arms
the
purple
riband
wound
wherewith
she
wreathed
her
largely
spreading
hair
nor
could
the
youth
abstain
but
he
must
wear
the
sacred
ring
wherewith
she
was
endowed
when
first
religious
chastity
she
vowed
which
made
his
love
through
sestos
to
be
known
and
thence
unto
abydos
sooner
blown
than
he
could
sail
for
incorporeal
fame
whose
weight
consists
in
nothing
but
her
name
is
swifter
than
the
wind
whose
tardy
plumes
are
reeking
water
and
dull
earthly
fumes
home
when
he
came
he
seemed
not
to
be
there
but
like
exiled
air
thrust
from
his
sphere
set
in
a
foreign
place
and
straight
from
thence
alcides
like
by
mighty
violence
he
would
have
chased
away
the
swelling
main
that
him
from
her
unjustly
did
detain
like
as
the
sun
in
a
diameter
fires
and
inflames
objects
removed
far
and
heateth
kindly
shining
laterally
so
beauty
sweetly
quickens
when
is
nigh
but
being
separated
and
removed
burns
where
it
cherished
murders
where
it
loved
therefore
even
as
an
index
to
a
book
so
to
his
mind
was
young
leander
look
o
none
but
gods
have
power
their
love
to
hide
affection
by
the
countenance
is
descried
the
light
of
hidden
fire
itself
discovers
and
love
that
is
concealed
betrays
poor
lovers
his
secret
flame
apparently
was
seen
leander
father
knew
where
he
had
been
and
for
the
same
mildly
rebuked
his
son
thinking
to
quench
the
sparkles
new
begun
but
love
resisted
once
grows
passionate
and
nothing
more
than
counsel
lovers
hate
for
as
a
hot
proud
horse
highly
disdains
to
have
his
head
controlled
but
breaks
the
reins
spits
forth
the
ringled
bit
and
with
his
hooves
checks
the
submissive
ground
so
he
that
loves
the
more
he
is
restrained
the
worse
he
fares
what
is
it
now
but
mad
leander
dares
o
hero
hero
thus
he
cried
full
oft
and
then
he
got
him
to
a
rock
aloft
where
having
spied
her
tower
long
stared
he
o
and
prayed
the
narrow
toiling
hellespont
to
part
in
twain
that
he
might
come
and
go
but
still
the
rising
billows
answered
no
with
that
he
stripped
him
to
the
ivory
skin
and
crying
love
i
come
leaped
lively
in
whereat
the
sapphire
visaged
god
grew
proud
and
made
his
capering
triton
sound
aloud
imagining
that
ganymede
displeased
had
left
the
heavens
therefore
on
him
he
seized
leander
strived
the
waves
about
him
wound
and
pulled
him
to
the
bottom
where
the
ground
was
strewed
with
pearl
and
in
low
coral
groves
sweet
singing
mermaids
sported
with
their
loves
on
heaps
of
heavy
gold
and
took
great
pleasure
to
spurn
in
careless
sort
the
shipwrack
treasure
for
here
the
stately
azure
palace
stood
where
kingly
neptune
and
his
train
abode
the
lusty
god
embraced
him
called
him
love
and
swore
he
never
should
return
to
jove
but
when
he
knew
it
was
not
ganymede
for
under
water
he
was
almost
dead
he
heaved
him
up
and
looking
on
his
face
beat
down
the
bold
waves
with
his
triple
mace
which
mounted
up
intending
to
have
kissed
him
and
fell
in
drops
like
tears
because
they
missed
him
leander
being
up
began
to
swim
and
looking
back
saw
neptune
follow
him
whereat
aghast
the
poor
soul
to
cry
o
let
me
visit
hero
ere
i
die
the
god
put
helle
bracelet
on
his
arm
and
swore
the
sea
should
never
do
him
harm
he
clapped
his
plump
cheeks
with
his
tresses
played
and
smiling
wantonly
his
love
bewrayed
he
watched
his
arms
and
as
they
opened
wide
at
every
stroke
betwixt
them
would
he
slide
and
steal
a
kiss
and
then
run
out
and
dance
and
as
he
turned
cast
many
a
lustful
glance
and
threw
him
gaudy
toys
to
please
his
eye
and
dive
into
the
water
and
there
pry
upon
his
breast
his
thighs
and
every
limb
and
up
again
and
close
beside
him
swim
and
talk
of
love
leander
made
reply
you
are
deceived
i
am
no
woman
i
thereat
smiled
neptune
and
then
told
a
tale
how
that
a
shepherd
sitting
in
a
vale
played
with
a
boy
so
fair
and
kind
as
for
his
love
both
earth
and
heaven
pined
that
of
the
cooling
river
durst
not
drink
lest
water
nymphs
should
pull
him
from
the
brink
and
when
he
sported
in
the
fragrant
lawns
goat
footed
satyrs
and
upstaring
fauns
would
steal
him
thence
ere
half
this
tale
was
done
ay
me
leander
cried
th
enamoured
sun
that
now
should
shine
on
thetis
glassy
bower
descends
upon
my
radiant
hero
tower
o
that
these
tardy
arms
of
mine
were
wings
and
as
he
spake
upon
the
waves
he
springs
neptune
was
angry
that
he
gave
no
ear
and
in
his
heart
revenging
malice
bare
he
flung
at
him
his
mace
but
as
it
went
he
called
it
in
for
love
made
him
repent
the
mace
returning
back
his
own
hand
hit
as
meaning
to
be
venged
for
darting
it
when
this
fresh
bleeding
wound
leander
viewed
his
colour
went
and
came
as
if
he
rued
the
grief
which
neptune
felt
in
gentle
breasts
relenting
thoughts
remorse
and
pity
rests
and
who
have
hard
hearts
and
obdurate
minds
but
vicious
harebrained
and
illiterate
hinds
the
god
seeing
him
with
pity
to
be
moved
thereon
concluded
that
he
was
beloved
love
is
too
full
of
faith
too
credulous
with
folly
and
false
hope
deluding
us
wherefore
leander
fancy
to
surprise
to
the
rich
ocean
for
gifts
he
flies
is
wisdom
to
give
much
a
gift
prevails
when
deep
persuading
oratory
fails
by
this
leander
being
near
the
land
cast
down
his
weary
feet
and
felt
the
sand
breathless
albeit
he
were
he
rested
not
till
to
the
solitary
tower
he
got
and
knocked
and
called
at
which
celestial
noise
the
longing
heart
of
hero
much
more
joys
than
nymphs
and
shepherds
when
the
timbrel
rings
or
crooked
dolphin
when
the
sailor
sings
she
stayed
not
for
her
robes
but
straight
arose
and
drunk
with
gladness
to
the
door
she
goes
where
seeing
a
naked
man
she
screeched
for
fear
such
sights
as
this
to
tender
maids
are
rare
and
ran
into
the
dark
herself
to
hide
rich
jewels
in
the
dark
are
soonest
spied
unto
her
was
he
led
or
rather
drawn
by
those
white
limbs
which
sparkled
through
the
lawn
the
nearer
that
he
came
the
more
she
fled
and
seeking
refuge
slipped
into
her
bed
whereon
leander
sitting
thus
began
through
numbing
cold
all
feeble
faint
and
wan
if
not
for
love
yet
love
for
pity
sake
me
in
thy
bed
and
maiden
bosom
take
at
least
vouchsafe
these
arms
some
little
room
who
hoping
to
embrace
thee
cheerly
swum
this
head
was
beat
with
many
a
churlish
billow
and
therefore
let
it
rest
upon
thy
pillow
herewith
affrighted
hero
shrunk
away
and
in
her
lukewarm
place
leander
lay
whose
lively
heat
like
fire
from
heaven
fet
would
animate
gross
clay
and
higher
set
the
drooping
thoughts
of
base
declining
souls
than
dreary
mars
carousing
nectar
bowls
his
hands
he
cast
upon
her
like
a
snare
she
overcome
with
shame
and
sallow
fear
like
chaste
diana
when
actaeon
spied
her
being
suddenly
betrayed
dived
down
to
hide
her
and
as
her
silver
body
downward
went
with
both
her
hands
she
made
the
bed
a
tent
and
in
her
own
mind
thought
herself
secure
with
dim
and
darksome
coverture
and
now
she
lets
him
whisper
in
her
ear
flatter
entreat
promise
protest
and
swear
yet
ever
as
he
greedily
assayed
to
touch
those
dainties
she
the
harpy
played
and
every
limb
did
as
a
soldier
stout
defend
the
fort
and
keep
the
foeman
out
for
though
the
rising
ivory
mount
he
scaled
which
is
with
azure
circling
lines
empaled
much
like
a
globe
a
globe
may
i
term
this
by
which
love
sails
to
regions
full
of
bliss
yet
there
with
sisyphus
he
toiled
in
vain
till
gentle
parley
did
the
truce
obtain
wherein
leander
on
her
quivering
breast
breathless
spoke
something
and
sighed
out
the
rest
which
so
prevailed
as
he
with
small
ado
enclosed
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
too
and
every
kiss
to
her
was
as
a
charm
and
to
leander
as
a
fresh
alarm
so
that
the
truce
was
broke
and
she
alas
poor
silly
maiden
at
his
mercy
was
love
is
not
full
of
pity
as
men
say
but
deaf
and
cruel
where
he
means
to
prey
even
as
a
bird
which
in
our
hands
we
wring
forth
plungeth
and
oft
flutters
with
her
wing
she
trembling
strove
this
strife
of
hers
like
that
which
made
the
world
another
world
begat
of
unknown
joy
treason
was
in
her
thought
and
cunningly
to
yield
herself
she
sought
seeming
not
won
yet
won
she
was
at
length
in
such
wars
women
use
but
half
their
strength
leander
now
like
theban
hercules
entered
the
orchard
of
th
hesperides
whose
fruit
none
rightly
can
describe
but
he
that
pulls
or
shakes
it
from
the
golden
tree
and
now
she
wished
this
night
were
never
done
and
sighed
to
think
upon
th
approaching
sun
for
much
it
grieved
her
that
the
bright
daylight
should
know
the
pleasure
of
this
blessed
night
and
them
like
mars
and
erycine
display
both
in
each
other
arms
chained
as
they
lay
again
she
knew
not
how
to
frame
her
look
or
speak
to
him
who
in
a
moment
took
that
which
so
long
so
charily
she
kept
and
fain
by
stealth
away
she
would
have
crept
and
to
some
corner
secretly
have
gone
leaving
leander
in
the
bed
alone
but
as
her
naked
feet
were
whipping
out
he
on
the
sudden
clinged
her
so
about
that
unto
the
floor
she
slid
one
half
appeared
the
other
half
was
hid
thus
near
the
bed
she
blushing
stood
upright
and
from
her
countenance
behold
ye
might
a
kind
of
twilight
break
which
through
the
hair
as
from
an
orient
cloud
glimpsed
here
and
there
and
round
about
the
chamber
this
false
morn
brought
forth
the
day
before
the
day
was
born
so
hero
ruddy
cheek
hero
betrayed
and
her
all
naked
to
his
sight
displayed
whence
his
admiring
eyes
more
pleasure
took
than
dis
on
heaps
of
gold
fixing
his
look
by
this
apollo
golden
harp
began
to
sound
forth
music
to
the
ocean
which
watchful
hesperus
no
sooner
heard
but
he
the
bright
car
prepared
and
ran
before
as
harbinger
of
light
and
with
his
flaring
beams
mocked
ugly
night
till
she
with
anguish
shame
and
rage
danged
down
to
hell
her
loathsome
carriage
the
end
of
the
second
sestiad
