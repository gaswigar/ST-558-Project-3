my
inspiration
preface
one
of
the
motives
that
have
actuated
me
in
recalling
these
simple
annals
of
our
daily
life
has
been
to
give
a
glimpse
to
civilians
of
garrison
and
camp
life
about
which
they
seem
to
have
such
a
very
imperfect
knowledge
this
ignorance
exists
especially
with
reference
to
anything
pertaining
to
the
cavalry
which
is
almost
invariably
stationed
on
the
extreme
frontier
the
isolation
of
the
cavalry
posts
makes
them
quite
inaccessible
to
travellers
and
the
exposure
incident
to
meeting
warlike
indians
does
not
tempt
the
visits
of
friends
or
even
of
the
venturesome
tourist
our
life
therefore
was
often
as
separate
from
the
rest
of
the
world
as
if
we
had
been
living
on
an
island
in
the
ocean
very
little
has
been
written
regarding
the
domestic
life
of
an
army
family
and
yet
i
can
not
believe
that
it
is
without
interest
for
the
innumerable
questions
that
are
asked
about
our
occupations
amusements
and
mode
of
lead
me
to
hope
that
the
actual
answers
to
these
queries
contained
in
this
little
story
will
be
acceptable
this
must
also
be
my
apology
for
entering
in
some
instances
so
minutely
into
trifling
perplexities
and
events
which
went
to
fill
up
the
sum
of
our
existence

change
of
station
general
custer
graduated
at
west
point
just
in
time
to
take
part
in
the
battle
of
bull
run
he
served
with
his
regiment
the
cavalry
for
a
time
but
eventually
was
appointed
to
general
mcclellan
he
came
to
his
sister
s
home
in
my
native
town
monroe
michigan
during
the
winter
of
and
there
i
first
met
him
in
the
spring
he
returned
to
the
army
in
virginia
and
was
promoted
that
summer
at
the
age
of
from
captain
to
during
the
following
autumn
he
came
to
monroe
to
recover
from
a
which
though
not
serious
disabled
him
somewhat
at
that
time
we
became
engaged
when
his
twenty
days
leave
of
absence
had
expired
he
went
back
to
duty
and
did
not
return
until
a
few
days
before
our
marriage
in
february
we
had
no
sooner
reached
washington
on
our
than
telegrams
came
following
one
another
in
quick
succession
asking
him
to
give
up
the
rest
of
his
leave
of
absence
and
hasten
without
an
hour
s
delay
to
the
front
i
begged
so
hard
not
to
be
left
behind
that
i
finally
prevailed
the
result
was
that
i
found
myself
in
a
few
hours
on
the
extreme
wing
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
in
an
isolated
virginia
finishing
my
honeymoon
alone
i
had
so
besought
him
to
allow
me
to
come
that
i
did
not
dare
own
to
myself
the
desolation
and
fright
i
felt
in
the
preparation
for
the
hurried
raid
which
my
husband
had
been
ordered
to
make
he
had
sent
to
cavalry
to
provide
for
my
safety
and
troops
were
in
reality
near
although
i
could
not
see
them
the
general
s
old
colored
servant
eliza
comforted
me
and
the
southern
family
in
the
house
took
pity
upon
my
anxiety
it
was
a
sudden
plunge
into
a
life
of
vicissitude
and
danger
and
i
hardly
remember
the
time
during
the
twelve
years
that
followed
when
i
was
not
in
fear
of
some
immediate
peril
or
in
dread
of
some
danger
that
threatened
after
the
raid
was
ended
we
spent
some
delightful
weeks
together
and
when
the
regular
spring
campaign
began
i
returned
to
washington
where
i
remained
until
the
surrender
and
the
close
of
the
war
after
that
we
went
to
texas
for
a
year
my
husband
still
acting
as
in
command
of
volunteers
in
we
returned
to
michigan
and
the
autumn
of
the
same
year
found
us
in
kansas
where
the
general
assumed
charge
of
the
regular
cavalry
to
which
he
had
been
assigned
with
the
rank
of
in
the
regular
army
we
remained
in
kansas
five
years
during
which
time
i
was
the
only
officer
s
wife
who
always
followed
the
regiment
we
were
then
ordered
with
the
regiment
to
kentucky
after
being
stationed
in
elizabethtown
for
two
years
we
went
to
dakota
in
the
spring
of
when
orders
came
for
the
cavalry
to
go
into
the
field
again
general
custer
was
delighted
the
regiment
was
stationed
in
various
parts
of
the
south
on
the
very
disagreeable
duty
of
breaking
up
illicit
distilleries
and
suppressing
the
fortunately
for
us
being
in
kentucky
we
knew
very
little
of
this
service
it
seemed
an
unsoldierly
life
and
it
was
certainly
uncongenial
for
a
true
cavalryman
feels
that
a
life
in
the
saddle
on
the
free
open
plain
is
his
legitimate
existence
not
an
hour
elapsed
after
the
official
document
announcing
our
change
of
station
had
arrived
before
our
house
was
torn
up
in
the
confusion
i
managed
to
retire
to
a
corner
with
an
atlas
and
surreptitiously
look
up
the
territory
to
which
we
were
going
i
hardly
liked
to
own
that
i
had
forgotten
its
location
when
my
finger
traced
our
route
from
kentucky
almost
up
to
the
border
of
the
british
possessions
it
seemed
as
if
we
were
going
to
lapland
from
the
first
days
of
our
marriage
general
custer
celebrated
every
order
to
move
with
wild
demonstrations
of
joy
his
exuberance
of
spirits
always
found
expression
in
some
boyish
pranks
before
he
could
set
to
work
seriously
to
prepare
for
duty
as
soon
as
the
officer
announcing
the
order
to
move
had
disappeared
all
sorts
of
wild
hilarity
began
i
had
learned
to
take
up
a
safe
position
on
top
of
the
table
that
is
if
i
had
not
already
been
forcibly
placed
there
as
a
spectator
the
most
disastrous
result
of
the
proceedings
was
possibly
a
broken
chair
which
the
master
of
ceremonies
would
crash
and
perhaps
throw
into
the
kitchen
by
way
of
informing
the
cook
that
good
news
had
come
we
had
so
few
household
effects
that
it
was
something
of
a
loss
when
we
chanced
to
be
in
a
country
where
they
could
not
be
replaced
i
can
see
eliza
s
woolly
head
now
as
she
thrust
it
through
the
door
to
reprimand
her
master
and
say
chairs
don
t
grow
on
trees
in
these
yere
parts
gen
as
for
me
i
was
tossed
about
the
room
and
all
sorts
of
jokes
were
played
upon
me
before
the
frolic
was
ended
after
such
participation
in
the
celebration
i
was
almost
too
tired
with
the
laughter
and
fun
to
begin
packing
i
know
that
it
would
surprise
a
mover
to
see
what
short
work
it
was
for
us
to
prepare
for
our
journeys
we
began
by
having
a
supply
of
and
hay
brought
in
from
the
stables
the
saddler
appeared
and
all
our
old
traps
that
had
been
taken
around
with
us
so
many
years
were
once
more
tied
and
sewed
up
the
kitchen
utensils
were
plunged
into
barrels
generally
left
uncovered
in
the
hurry
rolls
of
bedding
encased
in
waterproof
cloth
or
canvas
were
strapped
and
roped
and
the
few
pictures
and
books
were
crowded
into
chests
and
boxes
when
these
possessions
were
loaded
upon
the
wagon
at
the
last
moment
there
always
appeared
the
cook
s
bedding
to
surmount
the
motley
pile
her
property
was
invariably
tied
up
in
a
flaming
quilt
representing
souvenirs
of
her
friends
dresses
she
followed
that
last
instalment
with
anxious
eyes
and
true
to
her
early
training
grasped
her
red
bandanna
containing
a
few
last
things
while
the
satchel
she
scorned
to
use
hung
empty
on
her
arm
in
all
this
confusion
no
one
was
cross
we
rushed
and
gasped
through
the
one
day
given
us
for
preparation
and
i
had
only
time
to
be
glad
with
my
husband
that
he
was
going
back
to
the
life
of
activity
that
he
so
loved
his
enforced
idleness
made
it
seem
to
him
that
he
was
cumbering
the
earth
and
he
rejoiced
to
feel
that
he
was
again
to
have
the
chance
to
live
up
to
his
idea
of
a
soldier
had
i
dared
to
stop
in
that
hurried
day
and
think
of
myself
all
the
courage
would
have
gone
out
of
me
this
removal
to
dakota
meant
to
my
husband
a
reunion
with
his
regiment
and
summer
campaigns
against
indians
to
me
it
meant
months
of
loneliness
anxiety
and
terror
fortunately
there
was
too
much
to
do
to
leave
leisure
for
thought
steamers
were
ready
for
us
at
memphis
and
we
went
thither
by
rail
to
embark
when
the
regiment
was
gathered
together
after
a
separation
of
two
years
there
were
hearty
greetings
and
exchanges
of
troublous
or
droll
experiences
and
thankful
once
more
to
be
reunited
we
entered
again
heart
and
soul
into
the
minutest
detail
of
one
another
s
lives
we
went
into
camp
for
a
few
days
on
the
outskirts
of
memphis
and
exchanged
hospitalities
with
the
citizens
the
bachelors
found
an
elysium
in
the
society
of
many
very
pretty
girls
and
went
on
either
in
luxurious
parlors
or
in
the
open
air
as
they
rode
in
the
warm
spring
weather
to
and
from
our
camp
three
steamers
were
at
last
loaded
and
we
went
on
to
cairo
where
we
found
the
trains
prepared
to
take
us
into
dakota
the
regiment
was
never
up
to
its
maximum
of
twelve
hundred
men
but
there
may
have
been
eight
or
nine
hundred
soldiers
and
as
many
horses
the
property
of
the
companies
saddles
equipments
arms
ammunition
and
forage
together
with
the
personal
luggage
of
the
officers
made
the
trains
very
heavy
and
we
travelled
slowly
we
were
a
week
or
more
on
the
route
our
days
were
varied
by
the
long
stops
necessary
to
water
the
horses
and
occasionally
to
take
them
out
of
the
cars
for
exercise
my
husband
and
i
always
went
on
these
occasions
to
loose
the
dogs
and
have
a
frolic
and
a
little
visit
with
our
own
horses
the
youth
and
gamins
of
the
village
gathered
about
us
as
if
we
had
been
some
travelling
show
while
on
the
journey
one
of
our
family
had
a
birthday
this
was
always
a
day
of
frolic
and
fun
and
even
when
we
were
on
the
extreme
frontier
presents
were
sent
for
into
the
states
and
we
had
a
little
dinner
and
a
birthday
cake
this
birthday
that
came
during
the
journey
though
so
inopportune
did
not
leave
utterly
without
resources
the
minds
of
those
whose
ingenuity
was
quickened
by
affection
the
train
was
delayed
that
day
for
an
unusually
long
time
our
colored
cook
mary
in
despair
because
we
ate
so
little
in
the
places
determined
on
an
impromptu
feast
she
slyly
took
a
basket
and
filled
it
at
the
shops
in
the
village
street
she
had
already
made
friends
with
a
woman
who
had
a
little
cabin
tucked
in
between
the
rails
and
the
embankment
and
there
the
never
absent
eureka
was
produced
and
most
delicious
coffee
dripped
returning
to
the
car
stove
which
she
had
discovered
was
filled
with
a
deep
bed
of
coals
she
broiled
us
a
steak
and
baked
some
potatoes
the
general
and
i
were
made
to
sit
down
opposite
each
other
in
one
of
the
compartments
a
board
was
brought
covered
with
a
clean
towel
and
we
did
to
this
impromptu
table
we
did
not
dare
move
and
scarcely
ventured
to
giggle
for
fear
we
should
overturn
the
laden
board
in
our
laps
for
dessert
a
large
plate
of
macaroons
which
were
an
especial
weakness
of
mine
was
brought
out
as
a
surprise
mary
told
me
with
great
glee
how
she
had
seen
the
general
prowling
in
the
bakers
shops
to
buy
them
and
described
the
train
of
small
boys
who
followed
him
when
he
came
back
with
his
brown
paper
parcel
miss
libbie
she
said
they
thought
a
sure
enough
gen
l
always
went
on
horseback
and
carried
his
sword
in
his
we
were
so
hungry
we
scarcely
realized
that
we
were
anything
but
the
embodiment
of
picturesque
grace
no
one
could
be
otherwise
than
awkward
in
trying
to
cut
food
on
such
an
uncertain
base
while
mary
had
taken
the
last
scrap
of
dignity
away
from
the
general
s
appearance
by
enveloping
him
in
a
kitchen
towel
as
a
substitute
for
a
napkin
with
their
usual
independence
and
indifference
to
ceremony
troops
of
curious
citizens
stalked
through
the
car
to
stare
at
my
husband
we
went
on
eating
calmly
unconscious
that
they
thought
the
picture
hardly
in
keeping
with
their
preconceived
ideas
of
a
commanding
officer
when
we
thanked
mary
for
our
feast
her
face
beamed
and
shone
with
a
combination
of
joy
at
our
delight
and
heat
from
the
stove
when
she
lifted
up
our
frugal
board
and
set
us
free
we
had
a
long
stroll
talking
over
other
birthdays
and
those
yet
to
come
until
the
train
was
ready
to
start
chapter
ii
a
blizzard
after
so
many
days
in
the
car
we
were
glad
to
stop
on
an
open
plain
about
a
mile
from
the
town
of
yankton
where
the
road
ended
the
three
chief
considerations
for
a
camp
are
wood
water
and
good
ground
the
latter
we
had
but
we
were
at
some
distance
from
the
water
and
neither
trees
nor
brushwood
were
in
sight
the
long
trains
were
unloaded
of
their
freight
and
the
plains
about
us
seemed
to
swarm
with
men
and
horses
i
was
helped
down
from
the
pullman
car
where
inlaid
woods
mirrors
and
plush
surrounded
us
to
the
ground
perfectly
bare
of
every
earthly
comfort
the
other
ladies
of
the
regiment
went
on
to
the
hotel
in
the
town
the
general
suggested
that
i
should
go
with
them
but
i
had
been
in
camp
so
many
summers
it
was
not
a
formidable
matter
for
me
to
remain
and
fortunately
for
what
followed
i
did
so
the
household
belongings
were
gathered
together
a
family
of
little
new
puppies
some
dogs
the
cages
of
and
canaries
were
all
corralled
safely
in
a
little
stockade
made
of
chests
and
trunks
and
we
set
ourselves
about
making
a
temporary
home
the
general
and
a
number
of
soldiers
composing
the
detail
were
obliged
to
go
at
once
to
lay
out
the
main
camp
and
assign
the
companies
to
their
places
later
on
when
the
most
important
work
was
done
our
tents
were
to
be
pitched
while
i
sat
on
a
chest
waiting
the
air
grew
suddenly
chilly
the
bright
sun
of
the
morning
disappeared
and
the
rain
began
to
fall
had
we
been
accustomed
to
the
climate
we
would
have
known
that
these
changes
were
the
precursors
of
a
when
we
left
memphis
not
a
fortnight
before
we
wore
muslin
gowns
and
were
then
uncomfortably
warm
it
seemed
impossible
that
even
so
far
north
there
could
be
a
returned
winter
in
the
middle
of
april
we
were
yet
to
realize
what
had
been
told
us
of
the
climate
that
there
were
eight
months
of
winter
and
four
of
very
late
in
the
on
the
bluffs
beyond
us
was
a
but
they
sent
us
no
warning
many
years
of
campaigning
in
the
indian
territory
kansas
colorado
and
nebraska
give
one
an
idea
of
what
the
weather
can
do
but
each
new
country
has
its
peculiarities
and
it
seemed
we
had
reached
one
where
all
the
others
were
outdone
as
the
afternoon
of
that
first
day
advanced
the
wind
blew
colder
and
i
found
myself
eying
with
envy
a
little
cabin
without
an
enclosure
standing
by
itself
years
of
encountering
the
winds
of
kansas
when
our
tents
were
torn
and
blown
down
so
often
had
taught
me
to
appreciate
any
kind
of
a
house
even
though
it
were
built
upon
the
sand
as
this
one
was
a
which
the
tornado
swept
over
but
could
not
harm
was
even
more
of
a
treasure
the
change
of
climate
from
the
extreme
south
to
the
far
north
had
made
a
number
of
the
men
ill
and
even
the
superb
health
of
the
general
had
suffered
he
continued
to
superintend
the
camp
however
though
i
begged
him
from
time
to
time
as
i
saw
him
to
give
up
i
felt
sure
he
needed
a
shelter
and
some
comfort
at
once
so
i
took
courage
to
plan
for
myself
before
this
i
had
always
waited
as
the
general
preferred
to
prepare
everything
for
me
after
he
had
consented
that
we
should
try
for
the
little
house
some
of
the
soldiers
found
the
owner
in
a
distant
cabin
and
he
rented
it
to
us
for
a
few
days
the
place
was
equal
to
a
palace
to
me
there
was
no
plastering
and
the
house
seemed
hardly
weatherproof
it
had
a
floor
however
and
an
upper
story
divided
off
by
beams
over
these
mary
and
i
stretched
blankets
and
shawls
and
so
made
two
rooms
it
did
not
take
long
to
settle
our
few
things
and
when
wood
and
water
were
brought
from
a
distance
we
were
quite
ready
for
except
that
we
lacked
a
stove
and
some
supplies
mary
walked
into
the
town
to
hire
or
buy
a
small
but
she
could
not
induce
the
merchant
to
bring
it
out
that
night
she
was
thoughtful
enough
to
take
along
a
basket
and
brought
with
her
a
little
marketing
before
she
had
come
within
sight
of
our
cabin
on
her
return
the
snow
was
falling
so
fast
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
found
her
way
meanwhile
the
general
had
returned
completely
exhausted
and
very
ill
without
his
knowledge
i
sent
for
the
surgeon
who
like
all
of
his
profession
in
the
army
came
promptly
he
gave
me
some
powerful
medicine
to
administer
every
hour
and
forbade
the
general
to
leave
his
bed
it
was
growing
dark
and
we
were
in
the
midst
of
a
dakota
blizzard
the
snow
was
so
fine
that
it
penetrated
the
smallest
cracks
and
soon
we
found
white
lines
appearing
all
around
us
where
the
roof
joined
the
walls
on
the
windows
and
under
the
doors
outside
the
air
was
so
thick
with
the
whirling
tiny
particles
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
see
one
s
hand
held
out
before
one
the
snow
was
fluffy
and
thick
like
wool
and
fell
so
rapidly
and
seemingly
from
all
directions
that
it
gave
me
a
feeling
of
suffocation
as
i
stood
outside
mary
was
not
easily
discouraged
and
piling
a
few
light
fagots
outside
the
door
she
tried
to
light
a
fire
the
wind
and
the
muffling
snow
put
out
every
little
blaze
that
started
however
and
so
giving
it
up
she
went
into
the
house
and
found
the
we
had
brought
from
the
car
in
which
remained
some
sandwiches
and
these
composed
our
supper
the
night
had
almost
settled
down
upon
us
when
the
adjutant
came
for
orders
knowing
the
scarcity
of
fuel
and
the
danger
to
the
horses
from
exposure
to
the
rigor
of
such
weather
after
their
removal
from
a
warm
climate
the
general
ordered
the
breaking
of
camp
all
the
soldiers
were
directed
to
take
their
horses
and
go
into
yankton
and
ask
the
citizens
to
give
them
shelter
in
their
homes
and
stables
in
a
short
time
the
camp
was
nearly
deserted
only
the
laundresses
two
or
three
officers
and
a
few
dismounted
soldiers
remaining
the
true
to
the
unvarying
western
hospitality
gave
everything
they
could
to
the
use
of
the
regiment
the
officers
found
places
in
the
hotels
the
sounds
of
the
hoofs
of
the
hurrying
horses
flying
by
our
cabin
on
their
way
to
the
town
had
hardly
died
out
before
the
black
night
closed
in
and
left
us
alone
on
that
wide
deserted
plain
the
servants
mary
and
ham
did
what
they
could
to
make
the
room
comfortable
by
stopping
the
cracks
and
barricading
the
frail
door
the
hours
of
our
imprisonment
there
seems
now
a
frightful
nightmare
the
wind
grew
higher
and
higher
and
shrieked
about
the
little
house
dismally
it
was
built
without
a
foundation
and
was
so
rickety
it
seemed
as
it
rocked
in
a
great
gust
of
wind
that
it
surely
would
be
unroofed
or
overturned
the
general
was
too
ill
for
me
to
venture
to
find
my
usual
comfort
from
his
voice
i
dressed
in
my
heaviest
gown
and
jacket
and
remained
under
the
blankets
as
much
as
i
could
to
keep
warm
occasionally
i
crept
out
to
shake
off
the
snow
from
the
counterpane
for
it
sifted
in
between
the
roof
and
clapboards
very
rapidly
i
hardly
dared
take
the
little
phial
in
my
benumbed
fingers
to
drop
the
precious
medicine
for
fear
it
would
fall
i
realized
as
the
night
advanced
that
we
were
as
isolated
from
the
town
and
even
the
camp
not
a
mile
distant
as
if
we
had
been
on
an
island
in
the
river
the
doctor
had
intended
to
return
to
us
but
his
serious
face
and
impressive
injunctions
made
me
certain
that
he
considered
the
life
of
the
general
dependent
on
the
medicine
being
regularly
given
during
the
night
i
was
startled
by
hearing
a
dull
sound
as
of
something
falling
heavily
flying
down
the
stairs
i
found
the
servants
prying
open
the
frozen
and
door
to
admit
a
half
dozen
soldiers
who
becoming
bewildered
by
the
snow
had
been
saved
by
the
faint
light
we
had
placed
in
the
window
after
that
several
came
and
two
were
badly
frozen
we
were
in
despair
of
finding
any
way
of
warming
them
as
there
was
no
bedding
and
of
course
no
fire
until
i
remembered
the
carpets
which
were
sewed
up
in
bundles
and
heaped
in
one
corner
where
the
boxes
were
and
which
we
were
not
to
use
until
the
garrison
was
reached
spreading
them
out
we
had
enough
to
roll
up
each
wanderer
as
he
came
the
frozen
men
were
in
so
exhausted
a
condition
that
they
required
immediate
attention
their
sufferings
were
intense
and
i
could
not
forgive
myself
for
not
having
something
with
which
to
revive
them
the
general
never
tasted
liquor
and
we
were
both
so
well
always
we
did
not
even
keep
it
for
use
in
case
of
sickness
i
saw
symptoms
of
that
deadly
stupor
which
is
the
sure
precursor
of
freezing
when
i
fortunately
remembered
a
bottle
of
alcohol
which
had
been
brought
for
the
mary
objected
to
using
the
only
means
by
which
we
could
make
coffee
for
ourselves
but
the
groans
and
exhausted
and
haggard
faces
of
the
men
won
her
over
and
we
saw
them
revive
under
the
influence
of
the
fiery
liquid
poor
fellows
they
afterwards
lost
their
feet
and
some
of
their
fingers
had
also
to
be
amputated
the
first
soldier
who
had
reached
us
unharmed
except
from
exhaustion
explained
that
they
had
all
attempted
to
find
their
way
to
town
and
the
storm
had
completely
overcome
them
fortunately
one
had
clung
to
a
bag
of
which
was
all
they
had
had
to
eat
at
last
the
day
came
but
so
darkened
by
the
snow
it
seemed
rather
a
twilight
the
drifts
were
on
three
sides
of
us
like
a
wall
the
long
hours
dragged
themselves
away
leaving
the
general
too
weak
to
rise
and
in
great
need
of
hot
nourishing
food
i
grew
more
and
more
terrified
at
our
utterly
desolate
condition
and
his
continued
illness
though
fortunately
he
did
not
suffer
he
was
too
ill
and
i
too
anxious
to
eat
the
fragments
that
remained
in
the
the
snow
continued
to
come
down
in
great
swirling
sheets
while
the
wind
shook
the
loose
and
sometimes
broke
in
the
door
when
night
came
again
and
the
cold
increased
i
believed
that
our
hours
were
numbered
i
missed
the
voice
of
the
courageous
mary
for
she
had
sunk
down
in
a
corner
exhausted
for
want
of
sleep
while
ham
had
been
completely
demoralized
from
the
first
occasionally
i
melted
a
little
place
on
the
frozen
and
saw
that
the
drifts
were
almost
level
with
the
upper
windows
on
either
side
but
that
the
wind
had
swept
a
clear
space
before
the
door
during
the
night
the
sound
of
the
tramping
of
many
feet
rose
above
the
roar
of
the
storm
a
great
drove
of
mules
rushed
up
to
the
sheltered
side
of
the
house
their
brays
had
a
sound
of
terror
as
they
pushed
kicked
and
crowded
themselves
against
our
little
cabin
for
a
time
they
huddled
together
hoping
for
warmth
and
then
despairing
they
made
a
mad
rush
away
and
were
soon
lost
in
the
white
wall
of
snow
beyond
all
night
long
the
neigh
of
a
distressed
horse
almost
human
in
its
appeal
came
to
us
at
intervals
the
door
was
pried
open
once
thinking
it
might
be
some
suffering
in
distress
the
strange
wild
eyes
of
the
horse
peering
in
for
help
haunted
me
long
afterwards
occasionally
a
lost
dog
lifted
up
a
howl
of
distress
under
our
window
but
before
the
door
could
be
opened
to
admit
him
he
had
disappeared
in
the
darkness
when
the
night
was
nearly
spent
i
sprang
again
to
the
window
with
a
new
horror
for
no
one
until
he
hears
it
for
himself
can
realize
what
varied
sounds
animals
make
in
the
excitement
of
peril
a
drove
of
hogs
squealing
and
grunting
were
pushing
against
the
house
and
the
door
which
had
withstood
so
much
had
to
be
held
to
keep
it
from
being
broken
in
it
was
almost
unbearable
to
hear
the
groans
of
the
soldiers
over
their
swollen
and
painful
feet
and
know
that
we
could
do
nothing
to
ease
them
to
be
in
the
midst
of
such
suffering
and
yet
have
no
way
of
ameliorating
it
to
have
shelter
and
yet
to
be
surrounded
by
dumb
beasts
appealing
to
us
for
help
was
simply
terrible
every
minute
seemed
a
day
every
hour
a
year
when
daylight
came
i
dropped
into
an
exhausted
slumber
and
was
awakened
by
mary
standing
over
our
bed
with
a
tray
of
hot
breakfast
i
asked
if
help
had
come
and
finding
it
had
not
of
course
i
could
not
understand
the
smoking
food
she
told
me
that
feeling
the
necessity
of
the
general
s
eating
it
had
come
to
her
in
the
that
she
would
cut
up
the
large
candles
she
had
pilfered
from
the
cars
and
try
if
she
could
cook
over
the
many
short
pieces
placed
close
together
so
as
to
make
a
large
flame
the
result
was
hot
coffee
and
some
bits
of
the
steak
she
had
brought
from
town
fried
with
a
few
slices
of
potatoes
she
could
not
resist
telling
me
how
much
better
she
could
have
done
had
i
not
given
away
the
alcohol
to
the
frozen
men
the
breakfast
revived
the
general
so
much
that
he
began
to
make
light
of
danger
in
order
to
quiet
me
the
snow
had
ceased
to
fall
but
for
all
that
it
still
seemed
that
we
were
castaways
and
forgotten
hidden
under
the
drifts
that
nearly
surrounded
us
help
was
really
near
at
hand
however
at
even
this
darkest
hour
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
cheery
voices
of
men
came
up
to
our
ears
some
citizens
of
yankton
had
at
last
found
their
way
to
our
relief
and
the
officers
who
neither
knew
the
way
nor
how
to
travel
over
such
a
country
had
gladly
followed
they
told
us
that
they
had
made
several
attempts
to
get
out
to
us
but
the
snow
was
so
soft
and
light
that
they
could
make
no
headway
they
floundered
and
sank
down
almost
out
of
sight
even
in
the
streets
of
the
town
of
course
no
horse
could
travel
but
they
told
me
of
their
intense
anxiety
and
said
that
fearing
i
might
be
in
need
of
immediate
help
they
had
dragged
a
cutter
over
the
drifts
which
now
had
a
crust
of
ice
formed
from
the
sleet
and
the
moisture
of
the
damp
night
air
of
course
i
declined
to
go
without
the
general
but
i
was
more
touched
than
i
could
express
by
their
thought
of
me
i
made
some
excuse
to
go
where
with
my
head
buried
in
the
shawl
partition
i
tried
to
smother
the
sobs
that
had
been
suppressed
during
the
terrors
of
our
desolation
here
the
general
found
me
and
though
comforting
me
by
tender
words
he
still
reminded
me
that
he
would
not
like
any
one
to
know
that
i
had
lost
my
pluck
when
all
the
danger
i
had
passed
through
was
really
ended
the
officers
made
their
way
over
to
camp
for
they
were
anxious
and
uncertain
as
to
what
might
have
happened
to
the
few
persons
remaining
there
i
had
been
extremely
troubled
for
each
of
the
soldiers
for
whom
we
had
been
caring
had
with
a
trooper
s
usual
love
of
the
sensational
told
us
of
frozen
men
and
of
the
birth
of
babies
to
the
laundresses
these
stories
had
reached
town
through
stragglers
until
we
imagined
from
the
exaggeration
that
enough
children
might
be
found
to
start
a
small
orphan
asylum
the
officers
soon
returned
with
the
story
reduced
to
one
little
stranger
who
had
come
safely
into
this
world
in
the
stormy
night
sheltered
by
a
tent
only
no
men
were
frozen
fortunately
though
all
had
suffered
the
soldier
detailed
to
take
care
of
the
general
s
horses
found
his
way
back
with
them
and
in
his
solemn
voice
told
us
that
in
spite
of
every
effort
sharing
his
blankets
and
holding
the
little
things
through
the
storm
the
puppies
had
frozen
one
by
one
there
was
one
little
in
camp
which
the
officers
brought
back
accompanied
by
its
owner
an
old
and
somewhat
infirm
officer
in
the
midst
of
all
this
excitement
and
the
reaction
from
the
danger
i
could
not
suppress
my
sense
of
the
ludicrous
when
i
saw
the
daintiest
and
most
exquisite
officer
of
ours
whom
last
i
remembered
careering
on
his
perfectly
equipped
and
prancing
steed
before
the
admiring
eyes
of
the
memphis
belles
now
wound
up
with
scarfs
and
impromptu
leggings
of
flannel
his
hat
tied
down
with
a
woollen
comforter
buffalo
gloves
on
his
hands
and
clasping
a
necessary
for
the
precious
stove
some
of
the
officers
had
brought
out
parcels
containing
food
while
our
brother
colonel
tom
custer
had
struggled
with
a
large
basket
of
supplies
in
a
short
time
another
officer
appeared
at
our
door
with
a
face
full
of
anxiety
about
our
welfare
he
did
not
tell
us
what
we
afterwards
learned
from
others
that
fearing
the
citizens
would
give
up
going
to
us
and
knowing
that
he
could
not
find
the
way
alone
over
a
country
from
which
the
snow
had
obliterated
every
landmark
he
had
started
to
go
the
whole
distance
on
the
railroad
coming
to
a
long
bridge
he
found
the
track
so
covered
with
ice
that
it
was
a
dangerous
footing
the
wind
blew
the
sleet
and
snow
in
his
face
almost
blinding
him
but
nothing
daunted
he
crawled
over
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
continuing
to
use
the
track
as
his
guide
stopped
when
he
thought
he
might
be
opposite
our
cabin
and
ploughed
his
way
with
difficulty
through
the
drifts
when
the
officers
had
returned
to
town
we
made
a
fire
in
the
little
stove
which
had
been
put
as
the
pipe
was
so
short
we
ensconced
our
visitor
to
whom
the
stove
belonged
near
by
he
was
a
capital
fireman
we
divided
our
bedding
with
him
and
put
it
on
the
floor
as
close
as
possible
to
the
fire
the
shawl
and
blanket
partition
separated
our
rooms
but
did
not
seem
to
deaden
sound
and
at
night
i
only
lost
consciousness
of
the
audible
sleeping
of
our
guest
after
i
had
dropped
the
point
of
a
finger
in
my
ear
he
was
the
one
among
us
who
being
the
oldest
of
our
circle
and
having
had
a
varied
experience
was
an
authority
on
many
subjects
he
had
peculiar
and
extreme
ideas
on
some
questions
we
listened
out
of
respect
but
we
all
drew
the
line
at
following
some
of
his
advice
and
over
one
topic
there
was
general
revolt
he
disbelieved
entirely
in
the
external
or
internal
use
of
water
and
living
as
we
did
in
countries
where
the
rivers
were
flowing
mud
and
the
smaller
streams
dried
up
under
the
blazing
sun
his
would
have
been
a
convenient
system
to
say
the
least
unfortunately
our
prejudices
in
favor
of
cleanliness
increased
with
the
scarcity
of
water
bathing
became
one
of
the
luxuries
as
well
as
one
of
the
absolute
necessities
of
life
from
being
compelled
to
do
with
very
little
water
we
had
learned
almost
to
take
a
bath
in
a
thimble
and
to
this
day
i
find
myself
pouring
the
water
out
of
a
pitcher
in
a
most
gingerly
manner
so
strong
is
the
power
of
habit
even
now
with
the
generous
rush
of
the
unstinted
croton
at
my
disposal
the
theory
of
our
venerable
friend
on
the
danger
of
bathing
was
fortified
with
many
an
earnest
argument
and
the
advantages
of
his
improved
system
of
dry
rubbing
set
out
elaborately
in
his
best
rhetoric
nevertheless
taking
a
bath
with
the
palm
of
the
hand
was
combated
to
the
last
by
his
hearers
when
i
had
heard
him
arguing
previously
i
had
rather
believed
it
to
be
the
vagary
of
the
hour
i
had
proof
to
the
contrary
the
next
morning
after
the
storm
for
i
was
awakened
by
a
noise
of
vigorous
friction
and
violent
breathing
as
of
some
one
laboring
diligently
i
suddenly
remembered
the
doctrine
of
our
guest
and
realized
that
he
was
putting
theory
into
practice
as
softly
as
i
awakened
my
husband
and
tried
to
whisper
to
him
he
was
on
nettles
instantly
hearing
the
quiver
of
laughter
in
my
voice
he
feared
i
might
be
heard
and
that
the
feelings
of
the
man
for
whom
he
had
such
regard
might
be
wounded
he
promptly
requested
me
to
smother
my
laughter
in
the
blankets
and
there
i
shook
with
merriment
perhaps
even
greater
because
of
the
relief
i
experienced
in
finding
something
to
counteract
the
gloom
of
the
preceding
hours
and
if
i
owned
to
telling
afterwards
that
the
old
officer
s
theory
and
practice
were
one
it
could
not
be
called
a
great
breach
of
hospitality
for
he
gloried
in
what
he
called
advanced
ideas
and
strove
to
wear
the
martyr
s
crown
that
all
pioneers
in
new
and
extreme
beliefs
crowd
on
their
heads
our
friend
remained
with
us
until
the
camp
was
inhabitable
and
the
regular
order
of
military
duties
was
resumed
paths
and
roads
were
made
through
the
snow
and
it
was
a
great
relief
to
be
again
in
the
scenes
of
busy
life
we
did
not
soon
forget
our
introduction
to
dakota
after
that
we
understood
why
the
frontiersman
builds
his
stable
near
the
house
we
also
comprehended
then
when
they
told
us
that
they
did
not
dare
to
cross
in
a
blizzard
from
the
house
to
the
without
keeping
hold
of
a
rope
tied
fast
to
the
latch
as
a
guide
for
their
safe
return
when
the
stock
was
fed
afterwards
when
even
our
soldiers
lost
their
way
and
wandered
aimlessly
near
their
quarters
and
when
found
were
dazed
in
speech
and
look
the
remembrance
of
that
first
storm
with
the
density
of
the
snow
was
a
solution
to
us
of
their
bewilderment
chapter
iii
western
hospitality
the
citizens
of
yankton
endeavoring
to
make
up
for
the
inhospitable
reception
the
weather
had
given
us
vied
with
one
another
in
trying
to
make
the
regiment
welcome
the
hotel
was
filled
with
the
families
of
the
officers
and
after
the
duties
of
the
day
were
over
in
camp
the
married
men
went
into
town
we
were
called
upon
asked
to
dine
and
finally
tendered
a
ball
it
was
given
in
the
public
hall
of
the
town
which
being
decorated
with
flags
and
ornamented
with
all
the
military
paraphernalia
that
could
be
used
effectively
was
really
very
attractive
we
had
left
gas
far
behind
us
and
we
had
not
the
mellow
becoming
light
of
but
those
western
people
were
generous
about
lamps
as
they
are
about
everything
else
and
the
hall
was
very
bright
the
ladies
had
many
trials
in
endeavoring
to
make
themselves
presentable
we
burrowed
in
the
depths
of
trunks
for
those
bits
of
finery
that
we
had
supposed
would
not
be
needed
again
for
years
we
knew
the
officers
would
do
us
credit
through
all
the
sudden
changes
of
fashion
which
leave
an
army
lady
when
she
goes
into
the
territories
quite
an
antediluvian
in
toilet
after
a
few
months
the
officer
can
be
entirely
serene
he
can
be
conscious
that
he
looks
his
best
in
a
perfectly
fitting
uniform
and
that
he
is
never
out
of
date
the
general
and
i
went
into
the
hotel
and
took
a
room
for
the
night
of
the
ball
such
confusion
and
jolly
preparations
as
we
had
for
the
young
officers
came
to
borrow
the
corner
of
our
glass
to
put
on
the
finishing
touches
carrying
their
neckties
studs
and
gloves
in
their
hands
the
aigret
had
been
taken
from
the
helmet
and
placed
across
their
broad
chests
brightening
still
more
their
shining
new
uniforms
i
remember
with
what
pride
the
plebs
called
our
attention
to
the
double
row
of
buttons
which
the
change
in
the
uniform
now
gave
to
all
without
regard
to
rank
the
lieutenants
had
heretofore
only
been
allowed
one
row
of
buttons
and
they
declared
that
an
apollo
even
could
not
do
justice
to
his
figure
with
a
coat
fastened
in
so
monotonous
and
straight
a
manner
yankton
like
all
new
towns
was
chiefly
settled
with
people
who
ornamented
their
bits
of
front
yards
with
shining
new
perambulators
the
mothers
had
little
afternoon
parades
proud
enough
to
trundle
their
own
babies
if
any
one
s
father
ever
came
from
the
states
to
a
western
town
we
all
felt
at
liberty
to
welcome
his
gray
hairs
there
were
but
few
young
girls
but
that
night
must
have
been
a
memorable
one
for
them
all
the
town
and
even
the
country
people
came
to
the
ball
the
mayor
and
common
council
received
us
and
the
governor
opened
the
festivities
we
crossed
to
the
hotel
to
our
supper
we
were
asked
to
sit
down
to
the
table
and
the
abundance
of
substantials
proved
that
our
hosts
did
not
expect
us
to
nibble
the
general
was
of
course
taken
possession
of
by
the
city
fathers
and
mothers
finding
among
them
a
woman
he
knew
i
would
appreciate
he
placed
me
beside
her
at
supper
i
had
but
little
time
to
eat
for
she
was
not
only
clever
and
brave
but
very
interesting
in
her
description
of
the
dangers
and
hardships
she
had
endured
during
the
ten
years
of
her
pioneering
the
railroad
had
been
completed
but
a
short
time
and
before
that
the
life
was
wild
enough
she
sat
quietly
among
these
people
in
her
simple
stuff
gown
honored
and
looked
up
to
though
not
even
elderly
she
was
still
almost
the
oldest
citizen
and
an
authority
in
the
history
of
the
country
all
classes
and
conditions
came
to
the
ball
for
yankton
was
not
yet
large
enough
to
be
divided
into
cliques
besides
the
rough
and
hazardous
life
these
people
had
shared
endeared
them
to
one
another
the
days
after
this
passed
very
rapidly
the
officers
were
already
getting
the
command
into
condition
to
begin
the
long
march
of
five
hundred
miles
that
lay
before
us
before
we
left
the
general
desiring
to
return
some
of
the
civilities
of
the
citizens
gave
the
governor
and
his
staff
a
review
the
wide
plain
on
which
our
camp
was
located
was
admirably
adapted
to
the
display
of
troops
my
heart
swelled
with
pride
to
see
our
grand
regiment
all
together
once
more
and
in
such
fine
condition
when
the
review
was
closing
and
that
part
came
where
the
officers
leave
their
companies
and
joining
ride
abreast
to
salute
the
commanding
officer
the
general
could
hardly
maintain
the
stereotyped
motionless
quiet
of
the
soldier
the
approach
of
this
fine
body
of
men
made
him
so
proud
of
his
command
all
were
well
mounted
the
two
years
station
in
the
south
had
given
them
rare
opportunities
to
purchase
horses
the
general
being
considered
an
excellent
judge
had
at
the
request
of
the
officers
bought
several
from
the
stables
of
his
kentucky
friends
he
told
me
that
if
a
colt
failed
a
quarter
of
a
second
in
making
certain
time
expected
the
owner
was
disappointed
and
willing
to
sell
him
at
a
merely
nominal
sum
so
it
came
about
that
even
the
lieutenants
with
their
meagre
pay
owned
horses
whose
pedigree
was
unending
there
were
three
officers
belonging
to
each
of
the
twelve
companies
some
were
detailed
on
duty
elsewhere
but
those
remaining
with
the
adjutant
surgeon
quartermaster
and
commissary
made
a
long
line
of
brilliantly
caparisoned
and
magnificently
formed
men
mounted
on
no
wonder
that
the
moment
they
saluted
the
general
he
jumped
from
the
saddle
to
congratulate
them
and
show
them
his
pride
in
their
soldierly
appearance
the
governor
and
his
staff
were
not
chary
in
their
expressions
of
admiration
it
was
a
great
event
in
the
lives
of
the
citizens
and
the
whole
town
was
present
every
sort
of
vehicle
used
on
the
frontier
came
out
filled
to
overflowing
and
many
persons
walked
the
music
of
the
band
the
sun
lighting
up
the
polished
steel
of
the
arms
and
equipments
the
hundreds
of
spirited
horses
going
through
the
variety
of
evolutions
which
belong
to
a
mounted
regiment
made
a
memorable
scene
for
these
isolated
people
besides
they
felt
the
sensation
of
possession
when
they
knew
that
these
troops
had
come
to
open
the
country
and
protect
those
more
adventurous
spirits
who
were
already
finding
that
a
place
into
which
the
railroad
ran
was
too
far
east
for
them
one
day
we
were
all
invited
to
take
luncheon
on
board
the
steamer
that
had
been
chartered
to
take
the
regimental
property
up
the
river
to
bismarck
the
owner
of
the
boat
was
very
hospitable
and
champagne
flowed
freely
as
he
proposed
toasts
the
officers
and
ladies
of
the
regiment
received
with
pleasure
all
this
politeness
and
since
these
occasions
were
rare
in
the
lives
of
those
of
us
who
lived
always
on
the
outskirts
of
civilization
we
were
reluctant
to
go
home
my
horse
had
been
sent
away
by
some
mistake
and
the
general
accepted
the
offer
of
the
host
to
drive
me
out
to
camp
he
riding
for
a
time
beside
the
carriage
and
then
with
his
usual
restlessness
giving
rein
to
his
horse
for
a
brisk
gallop
it
was
not
long
before
i
discovered
that
the
uncertain
swaying
of
the
vehicle
from
side
to
side
and
the
hazardous
manner
in
which
we
skirted
the
deep
gullies
was
due
to
the
fact
that
our
friend
was
overcome
with
hospitality
trying
to
talk
intelligently
and
to
appear
not
to
notice
the
vagaries
of
the
driver
and
at
the
same
time
to
control
my
wandering
eyes
as
they
espied
from
afar
a
dangerous
bit
of
road
i
spent
a
very
uncomfortable
hour
fortunately
the
dear
polly
was
most
demure
in
harness
and
possibly
having
been
left
before
that
to
find
her
own
way
under
similar
circumstances
she
did
not
attempt
to
leap
with
the
carriage
over
ditches
as
her
gay
owner
invited
her
to
do
when
we
came
up
within
shouting
distance
of
the
general
i
cried
out
in
what
i
meant
to
seem
like
playful
menace
but
he
had
taken
in
the
situation
and
seeing
that
polly
was
to
be
trusted
he
mischievously
laughed
back
at
me
and
flew
over
the
country
finally
we
neared
our
little
cabin
and
my
last
fear
came
upon
me
mary
had
spread
the
far
and
wide
it
was
at
the
rear
of
the
house
but
my
escort
saw
no
door
and
polly
soon
wound
us
hopelessly
up
in
the
line
and
two
weeks
washing
while
she
quietly
tried
to
kick
her
way
through
the
and
mary
and
ham
extricated
me
and
started
the
old
nag
on
the
road
homeward
and
i
waved
a
relieved
to
the
retreating
carriage
only
such
impossible
wives
as
one
reads
of
in
books
would
have
lost
the
opportunity
for
a
few
wrathful
words
i
was
not
dangerous
though
and
the
peals
of
laughter
from
my
husband
as
he
described
my
wild
eyes
peering
out
from
the
side
of
the
carriage
soon
put
me
into
a
next
day
i
was
called
to
the
steps
and
found
that
polly
s
owner
had
discovered
that
we
had
a
door
he
said
an
how
d
ye
and
presented
a
adding
my
wife
tells
me
that
i
was
hardly
in
a
condition
to
deliver
a
temperance
lecture
yesterday
as
what
she
says
is
always
true
i
bring
my
ham
carried
in
the
hamper
and
though
i
urged
our
guest
to
remain
he
did
not
seem
quite
at
ease
and
drove
away
while
we
were
at
yankton
something
happened
that
filled
us
with
wonder
the
indians
from
the
reservation
near
brought
in
reports
that
came
through
other
tribes
of
the
modoc
disasters
it
was
a
marvel
to
the
general
to
find
that
at
that
distance
north
news
could
come
to
us
through
indian
runners
in
advance
of
that
we
received
by
the
telegraph
chapter
iv
cavalry
on
the
march
when
the
day
came
for
us
to
begin
our
march
the
sun
shone
and
the
wished
us
with
their
the
length
of
each
day
s
march
varied
according
to
the
streams
on
which
we
relied
for
water
or
the
arrival
of
the
boat
the
steamer
that
carried
the
forage
for
the
horses
and
the
supplies
for
the
command
was
tied
up
to
the
every
night
as
near
to
us
as
was
possible
the
laundresses
and
ladies
of
the
regiment
were
on
board
except
the
general
s
sister
margaret
who
made
her
first
march
with
her
husband
riding
all
the
way
on
horseback
as
usual
i
rode
beside
the
general
our
first
few
days
were
pleasant
and
we
began
at
once
to
enjoy
the
plover
the
land
was
so
covered
with
them
that
the
hunters
shot
them
with
all
sorts
of
arms
we
counted
eighty
birds
in
the
that
three
of
the
soldiers
brought
in
fortunately
there
were
several
in
the
possession
of
our
family
and
the
little
things
therefore
were
not
torn
to
pieces
but
could
be
broiled
over
the
coals
of
the
they
were
so
plump
that
their
legs
were
like
tiny
points
coming
from
beneath
the
rounded
outline
that
swept
the
grass
as
they
walked
no
butter
was
needed
in
cooking
them
for
they
were
very
fat
some
of
the
officers
had
not
left
behind
them
all
of
their
epicurean
tastes
and
preferred
to
have
the
birds
cooked
when
they
were
decidedly
in
this
way
they
secured
the
privilege
of
taking
their
odoriferous
luncheon
quite
apart
from
the
others
the
general
had
invited
two
officers
besides
his
brother
tom
and
his
calhoun
to
mess
with
him
we
had
a
tableful
and
very
merry
we
were
even
in
the
early
morning
to
joke
before
daylight
seems
impossible
but
even
at
breakfast
peals
of
laughter
went
up
from
the
one
of
the
officers
was
envied
and
we
declared
he
got
more
to
eat
than
the
rest
because
he
insisted
upon
carving
the
hash
while
to
cut
meat
for
all
our
hungry
circle
as
the
general
did
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
took
many
precious
moments
one
of
our
number
called
us
the
great
grab
mess
and
some
one
slyly
printed
the
words
in
large
black
letters
on
the
canvas
that
covered
the
which
was
usually
strapped
at
the
back
of
our
how
gladly
we
gathered
about
that
hamper
when
the
command
halted
at
noon
how
good
the
plover
and
sandwiches
tasted
while
we
quenched
our
thirst
with
cold
coffee
or
tea
since
we
were
named
as
we
were
we
all
dared
to
reach
over
and
help
ourselves
and
the
one
most
agile
and
with
the
longest
arms
was
the
best
fed
no
great
ceremony
is
to
be
expected
when
one
rises
before
four
and
takes
a
hurried
breakfast
by
the
light
of
a
the
soldiers
waiting
outside
to
take
down
the
tent
the
servants
hastily
and
suggestively
rattling
the
kettles
and
gridiron
as
they
packed
them
made
it
an
irresistible
temptation
for
one
hungry
to
we
had
a
very
satisfactory
little
it
began
its
career
with
legs
but
the
wind
used
to
lift
it
up
from
the
ground
with
such
violence
it
was
finally
dismembered
and
afterwards
placed
flat
on
the
ground
being
of
it
cooled
quickly
was
very
light
and
could
be
put
in
the
wagon
in
a
few
moments
after
the
morning
meal
was
cooked
when
we
came
out
from
breakfast
the
wagon
stood
near
partly
packed
and
bristling
with
kitchen
utensils
buckets
and
baskets
tied
outside
the
cover
axe
and
spade
lashed
to
the
side
while
the
little
stove
looked
out
from
the
end
the
stood
open
on
the
ground
to
receive
the
dishes
we
had
used
at
a
given
signal
the
went
down
with
all
those
along
the
line
and
they
were
stowed
away
in
the
wagons
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
then
drew
out
and
formed
in
order
at
the
rear
of
the
column
at
the
boots
and
saddles
each
soldier
mounted
and
took
his
place
in
line
all
riding
two
abreast
first
came
the
general
and
his
staff
with
whom
sister
margaret
and
i
were
permitted
to
ride
the
private
orderlies
and
detail
rode
in
our
rear
and
then
came
the
companies
according
to
the
places
assigned
them
for
the
day
finally
the
with
the
we
made
a
long
cavalcade
that
stretched
over
a
great
distance
when
we
reached
some
high
bluff
we
never
tired
of
watching
the
command
advancing
with
the
long
line
of
supply
wagons
with
their
white
covers
winding
around
bends
in
the
road
and
climbing
over
the
hills
every
day
the
breaking
of
camp
went
more
smoothly
and
quickly
until
as
the
days
advanced
the
general
used
to
call
me
to
his
side
to
notice
by
his
watch
how
few
moments
it
took
after
the
tents
were
ordered
down
to
set
the
whole
machinery
for
the
march
in
motion
and
i
remember
the
regiment
grew
so
skilful
in
preparation
that
in
one
campaign
the
hour
for
starting
never
varied
five
minutes
during
the
whole
summer
the
column
was
always
halted
once
during
the
day
s
march
to
water
the
horses
then
the
luncheons
were
brought
forth
they
varied
decidedly
sometimes
an
officer
took
from
his
pocket
a
hard
biscuit
wrapped
in
his
handkerchief
the
faithful
orderly
of
another
took
his
chief
s
sandwiches
from
his
own
haversack
and
brought
them
to
him
wherever
he
was
often
a
provident
officer
as
he
seated
himself
to
his
little
spread
on
the
grass
was
instantly
surrounded
by
interested
visitors
who
heedless
ever
of
any
future
believed
that
the
world
owed
them
a
living
and
they
were
resolved
to
have
it
when
the
stream
was
narrow
and
the
hundreds
of
horses
had
to
be
ranged
along
its
banks
to
be
watered
there
was
time
for
a
nap
i
soon
acquired
the
general
s
habit
of
sleeping
readily
he
would
throw
himself
down
anywhere
and
fall
asleep
instantly
even
with
the
sun
beating
on
his
head
it
only
takes
a
little
training
to
learn
to
sleep
without
a
pillow
on
uneven
ground
and
without
shade
i
learned
the
moment
i
was
helped
out
of
the
saddle
to
drop
upon
the
grass
and
lose
myself
in
a
twinkling
no
one
knows
what
a
privilege
it
is
to
be
stretched
out
after
being
cramped
over
the
horn
of
a
lady
s
saddle
for
hours
until
she
has
experienced
it
i
think
i
never
got
quite
over
wishing
for
the
shade
of
a
tree
but
there
was
often
a
little
strip
of
shadow
on
one
side
of
the
travelling
wagon
which
was
always
near
us
on
the
journey
i
was
not
above
selfishly
appropriating
the
space
under
the
wagon
if
it
had
not
been
taken
by
somebody
else
even
then
i
had
to
dislodge
a
whole
collection
of
dogs
who
soon
find
the
best
places
for
their
comfort
we
had
a
with
us
who
having
been
long
in
the
country
knew
the
streams
and
the
general
and
i
following
his
instructions
often
rode
in
advance
as
we
neared
the
night
s
camp
it
was
always
a
mild
excitement
and
new
pleasure
to
select
camp
the
men
who
carried
the
guidons
for
each
company
were
sent
for
and
places
assigned
them
the
general
delighted
to
unsaddle
his
favorite
horse
dandy
and
turn
him
loose
for
his
attachment
was
so
strong
he
never
grazed
far
from
us
he
was
not
even
tethered
and
after
giving
himself
the
luxury
of
a
roll
in
the
grass
he
ate
his
dinner
of
oats
and
browsed
about
the
tent
as
tame
as
a
kitten
he
whinnied
when
my
husband
patted
his
sleek
neck
and
looked
jealously
at
the
dogs
when
they
all
followed
us
into
the
tent
afterwards
after
tramping
down
the
grass
to
prevent
the
fire
from
spreading
my
husband
would
carry
dry
sticks
and
underbrush
and
place
them
against
a
fallen
tree
that
made
an
admirable
and
in
a
little
while
we
had
a
glorious
fire
the
general
having
a
peculiar
gift
of
starting
a
flame
on
the
wildest
day
the
next
thing
was
to
throw
himself
down
on
the
sod
cover
his
eyes
with
his
white
felt
hat
and
be
sound
asleep
in
no
time
no
matter
if
the
sun
beat
down
in
a
perfect
blaze
it
never
disturbed
him
the
dogs
came
at
once
to
lie
beside
him
i
have
seen
them
stretched
at
his
back
and
curled
around
his
head
while
the
nose
and
paws
of
one
rested
on
his
breast
and
yet
he
was
quite
unconscious
of
their
crowding
they
growled
and
scrambled
for
the
best
place
but
he
slept
placidly
through
it
all
when
the
command
arrived
the
guidons
pointed
out
the
location
for
each
company
the
horses
were
unsaddled
and
picketed
out
the
wagons
unloaded
and
the
tents
pitched
the
hewing
of
wood
and
the
hauling
of
water
came
next
and
after
the
were
lighted
the
air
was
full
of
savory
odors
of
the
soldiers
dinner
sometimes
the
ground
admitted
of
pitching
the
tents
of
the
whole
regiment
in
two
long
lines
facing
each
other
the
wagons
were
drawn
up
at
either
end
and
also
at
the
rear
of
the
two
rows
of
tents
they
were
placed
diagonally
one
end
overlapping
the
other
so
as
to
form
a
barricade
against
the
attack
of
indians
down
the
centre
of
the
company
street
large
ropes
were
stretched
to
which
the
horses
were
tied
at
night
our
tents
were
usually
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
at
one
end
of
the
company
street
and
it
never
grew
to
be
an
old
story
to
watch
the
camp
before
us
after
i
had
changed
my
for
my
one
other
gown
i
came
out
to
join
the
general
under
the
where
he
lay
alternately
watching
the
scene
and
reading
one
of
the
books
that
he
was
never
without
i
always
had
sewing
either
a
bit
of
that
was
destined
to
make
our
garrison
quarters
more
attractive
or
more
often
some
necessary
stitches
to
take
in
our
clothes
as
we
sat
there
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
a
stranger
seeing
us
to
believe
that
it
was
merely
the
home
of
a
day
our
camps
along
the
river
were
much
alike
and
each
day
when
we
entered
the
tent
our
few
things
were
placed
exactly
as
they
were
the
day
before
the
only
articles
of
furniture
we
had
with
us
were
two
a
bed
a
with
bucket
and
tin
dipper
and
a
little
mirror
this
last
fastened
to
the
swayed
to
and
fro
with
the
wind
and
made
it
a
superfluous
luxury
for
we
learned
to
dress
without
it
the
were
a
great
comfort
they
were
made
by
a
soldier
out
of
oak
with
leather
back
seat
and
arms
the
latter
so
arranged
with
straps
and
buckles
that
one
could
recline
or
sit
upright
at
will
i
once
made
a
long
march
and
only
took
a
for
a
seat
i
knew
therefore
what
an
untold
blessing
it
was
to
have
a
chair
in
which
to
lean
after
having
been
sitting
in
the
saddle
for
hours
we
had
tried
many
inventions
for
that
folded
but
nothing
stood
the
wear
and
tear
of
travel
like
the
simple
contrivance
of
two
carpenter
s
horses
placed
at
the
right
distance
apart
with
three
boards
laid
upon
them
such
a
bed
was
most
easily
transported
for
the
supports
could
be
tied
to
the
outside
of
the
wagon
while
the
boards
slipped
inside
before
the
rest
of
the
camp
equipage
was
packed
an
ineffaceable
picture
remains
with
me
even
now
of
those
lovely
camps
as
we
dreamily
watched
them
by
the
fading
light
of
the
afternoon
the
general
and
i
used
to
think
there
was
no
bit
of
color
equal
to
the
delicate
blue
line
of
smoke
which
rose
from
the
where
the
soldiers
suppers
were
being
cooked
the
effect
of
light
and
shade
and
the
varying
tints
of
that
perfect
sky
were
a
great
delight
to
him
the
mellow
air
brought
us
sounds
that
had
become
dear
by
long
and
happy
association
the
low
notes
of
the
bugle
in
the
hands
of
the
musician
practising
the
calls
the
click
of
the
currycomb
as
the
soldiers
groomed
their
horses
the
whistle
or
song
of
a
happy
trooper
and
even
the
irrepressible
accordeon
at
that
distance
made
a
melody
it
used
to
amuse
us
to
find
with
what
persistent
ingenuity
the
soldiers
smuggled
that
melancholy
instrument
no
matter
how
limited
the
transportation
after
a
few
days
march
it
was
brought
out
from
a
roll
of
blankets
or
the
teamster
who
had
been
bribed
to
keep
it
under
the
seat
produced
the
prized
possession
the
bay
of
the
hounds
was
always
music
to
the
general
the
bray
of
the
mules
could
not
be
included
under
that
head
but
it
was
one
of
those
sounds
from
home
to
which
we
had
become
attached
mingling
with
the
melodies
of
the
negro
servants
as
they
swung
the
at
the
rear
of
the
tents
were
the
buoyant
voices
of
the
officers
lying
under
the
smoking
the
consoling
pipe
the
twilight
almost
always
found
many
of
us
gathered
together
some
idling
on
the
grass
in
front
of
the
or
lounging
on
the
buffalo
robes
the
one
with
the
best
voice
sang
while
all
joined
in
the
chorus
we
all
had
much
patience
in
listening
to
what
must
necessarily
be
tales
for
it
would
have
taken
the
author
of
the
arabian
nights
to
supply
fresh
anecdotes
for
people
who
had
been
so
many
years
together
these
stories
usually
varied
somewhat
from
time
to
time
and
the
more
they
became
the
more
attentive
was
the
audience
the
territories
are
settled
by
people
who
live
an
intense
exaggerated
sort
of
existence
and
nothing
tame
attracts
them
in
order
to
compel
a
listener
i
myself
fell
into
the
habit
of
adding
a
cipher
or
two
to
stories
that
had
been
first
told
in
the
states
with
moderate
numbers
if
the
family
overheard
me
their
unquenchable
spirit
of
mischief
invariably
put
a
quietus
on
my
eloquence
in
fact
i
was
soon
cured
of
temptation
to
amplify
by
the
repeated
asides
of
my
deriding
family
oh
i
say
old
lady
won
t
you
come
down
a
hundred
or
two
sometimes
when
we
were
all
gathered
together
at
evening
we
improved
the
privilege
which
belongs
to
friendships
of
keeping
silent
the
men
yielded
to
the
soporific
influence
of
tobacco
in
quiet
content
knowing
that
nothing
was
expected
of
them
if
they
chose
not
to
talk
my
husband
and
i
sometimes
strolled
through
the
camp
at
twilight
and
even
went
among
the
citizen
teamsters
that
are
employed
for
the
march
when
they
were
preparing
their
evening
meal
these
teamsters
mess
together
on
the
march
as
the
officers
do
with
rarely
more
than
four
or
five
in
the
circle
one
of
the
number
buys
the
supplies
takes
charge
of
the
rations
and
keeps
the
accounts
the
sum
of
expenses
is
divided
at
the
end
of
the
month
and
each
pays
his
portion
they
take
turns
in
doing
the
cooking
which
being
necessarily
simple
each
can
bear
a
share
of
the
labor
sometimes
we
found
a
more
ambitious
member
of
the
mess
endeavoring
to
rise
superior
to
the
tiresome
he
had
bared
his
brawny
arms
and
was
mixing
biscuit
on
the
of
the
wagon
let
down
for
the
purpose
he
whistled
away
as
he
moulded
the
dough
with
his
horny
hands
and
it
would
have
seemed
that
he
had
a
delmonico
supper
to
anticipate
we
had
not
left
yankton
far
behind
us
before
we
were
surprised
to
see
one
of
its
most
hospitable
citizens
drive
up
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
missed
us
and
described
the
tameness
of
life
after
the
departure
of
the
cavalry
as
something
quite
past
endurance
we
were
so
stupid
as
not
to
discover
until
after
he
had
said
the
second
that
he
really
wanted
to
join
us
on
the
march
still
had
he
kept
on
i
am
sure
his
endurance
would
have
been
tested
for
while
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
been
discouraged
before
in
all
our
campaigning
i
was
so
during
the
storm
that
followed
the
weather
suddenly
changed
and
we
began
our
march
with
a
dull
gray
morning
and
stinging
cold
the
general
wound
me
up
in
all
the
outside
wraps
i
had
until
i
was
a
shapeless
mass
of
fur
and
wool
as
i
sat
in
the
saddle
we
could
talk
but
little
to
each
other
for
the
wind
cut
our
faces
and
stiffened
the
flesh
until
it
ached
my
hands
became
too
numb
to
hold
my
horse
so
i
gave
him
his
own
way
as
we
rode
along
like
automatons
i
was
keeping
my
spirits
up
with
the
thought
of
the
camp
we
would
make
in
the
underbrush
of
a
sheltered
valley
by
some
stream
and
the
coming
rose
brightly
in
my
imagination
we
went
slowly
as
the
usual
time
a
cavalry
command
makes
is
barely
four
miles
an
hour
it
was
a
discouraging
spot
where
we
finally
halted
it
was
on
a
stream
but
the
ice
was
thick
along
the
edges
and
all
we
could
see
was
the
opposite
bank
about
thirty
feet
high
so
frozen
over
that
it
looked
like
a
wall
of
solid
ice
it
was
difficult
to
pitch
the
tent
for
the
wind
twisted
and
tore
the
canvas
the
ground
was
already
so
frozen
that
it
took
a
long
time
to
drive
in
the
iron
pins
by
which
the
ropes
holding
the
tents
are
secured
all
the
tying
and
pinning
of
the
opening
was
of
little
avail
for
the
wind
twisted
off
the
tapes
and
flung
the
great
brass
pins
i
had
brought
on
purpose
for
canvas
far
and
wide
no
would
burn
of
course
in
such
a
gale
but
i
remembered
thankfully
the
sibley
stove
that
we
always
carried
the
saddler
had
cut
a
hole
in
the
roof
of
the
tent
for
the
pipe
and
fastened
zinc
around
it
to
make
it
safe
from
fire
i
shall
never
think
about
a
sibley
stove
without
gratitude
nor
cease
to
wonder
how
so
simple
an
invention
can
be
the
means
of
such
comfort
it
is
only
a
cone
of
open
at
the
top
and
bottom
the
broader
part
rests
on
the
ground
while
the
little
pipe
fits
on
the
top
the
wood
is
put
through
a
door
cut
in
the
side
only
billets
can
be
used
for
the
aperture
is
of
course
small
it
requires
almost
constant
attention
to
keep
the
insatiable
little
thing
filled
but
it
never
occurs
to
one
where
half
a
dozen
are
huddled
together
to
ask
who
shall
be
the
fireman
and
there
is
equal
division
of
labor
the
stove
is
so
light
that
in
marching
the
pipe
is
removed
and
a
rope
run
through
the
openings
which
enables
it
to
be
tied
underneath
the
wagon
beside
the
bucket
which
is
always
suspended
there
to
be
used
to
water
the
horses
the
general
was
busy
in
the
adjutant
s
tent
so
i
sent
for
the
sergeant
who
was
our
factotum
and
asked
him
to
hunt
up
the
sibley
stove
i
felt
disheartened
when
he
told
me
it
had
been
forgotten
a
i
could
have
gone
to
the
next
tent
where
a
provident
officer
had
put
his
up
but
i
felt
in
too
disagreeable
a
humor
to
inflict
myself
on
any
one
and
so
crept
into
bed
to
keep
warm
it
was
an
unmistakable
fit
of
sulks
and
i
was
in
the
valley
of
humiliation
next
morning
for
i
knew
well
how
difficult
it
is
to
have
ladies
on
the
march
and
how
many
obstacles
the
general
had
surmounted
to
arrange
for
my
coming
my
part
consisted
in
drilling
myself
to
be
as
little
trouble
as
i
could
i
had
really
learned
by
many
a
lesson
never
to
be
too
cold
or
too
hot
and
rarely
allowed
a
thought
of
hunger
if
we
were
where
no
supplies
could
be
had
it
was
a
long
struggle
but
i
finally
learned
never
to
drink
between
meals
as
it
is
always
difficult
to
get
water
on
a
march
i
can
remember
being
even
mortified
at
dropping
my
whip
for
i
wished
to
be
so
little
trouble
that
every
one
would
be
unconscious
of
my
presence
so
far
as
being
an
inconvenience
was
concerned
the
cold
of
dakota
overcame
me
on
that
one
day
but
it
was
the
last
time
i
succumbed
to
it
a
it
was
afterwards
recovered
chapter
camping
among
the
sioux
our
march
took
us
through
the
grounds
set
apart
by
the
government
for
the
use
of
the
sioux
indians
at
peace
with
our
country
we
had
not
made
much
progress
before
we
began
to
see
their
graves
they
do
not
bury
their
dead
but
place
them
on
boards
lashed
to
the
limbs
of
trees
or
on
high
platforms
raised
from
the
ground
by
four
poles
perhaps
twenty
feet
the
body
is
wound
round
and
round
with
clothing
or
blankets
like
a
mummy
and
inside
the
layers
are
placed
tobacco
and
jerked
beef
to
supply
them
on
the
imaginary
journey
to
the
happy
in
the
early
morning
when
it
was
not
quite
light
as
we
filed
by
these
solitary
sepulchres
it
was
uncanny
and
weird
and
the
sun
when
it
came
was
doubly
welcome
our
first
visitor
from
agency
indians
was
a
sioux
chief
he
was
tall
commanding
and
had
really
a
fine
face
when
he
was
ready
to
go
home
he
invited
us
to
come
to
his
village
before
we
left
on
our
next
march
at
twilight
my
husband
and
i
walked
over
the
village
was
a
collection
of
tepees
of
all
sizes
the
largest
being
what
is
called
the
medicine
lodge
where
the
councils
are
held
it
was
formed
of
tanned
sewed
together
with
buckskin
thongs
and
stretched
over
a
collection
of
poles
these
poles
are
of
great
value
to
the
indians
for
in
a
sparsely
timbered
country
like
dakota
it
is
difficult
to
find
suitable
trees
it
is
necessary
to
go
a
great
distance
to
procure
the
kind
of
sapling
that
is
light
and
pliable
and
yet
sufficiently
strong
for
the
purpose
the
poles
are
lashed
together
at
the
tops
and
radiate
in
a
circle
below
the
smoke
was
pouring
out
of
the
opening
above
and
the
only
entrance
to
the
tepee
was
a
round
aperture
near
the
ground
sufficiently
large
to
allow
a
person
to
crawl
in
around
the
lodge
were
poles
from
which
were
suspended
rags
in
these
were
tied
their
medicines
of
roots
and
herbs
supposed
to
be
a
charm
to
keep
off
evil
spirits
the
sound
of
music
came
from
within
i
crept
tremblingly
in
after
the
general
not
entirely
quieted
by
his
keeping
my
hand
in
his
and
whispering
something
to
calm
my
fears
as
i
sat
on
the
buffalo
robe
beside
him
in
the
first
place
i
knew
how
resolute
the
indians
were
in
never
admitting
one
of
their
own
women
to
council
and
their
curious
eyes
and
forbidding
expressions
towards
me
did
not
add
to
my
comfort
the
dust
smoke
and
noise
in
the
fading
light
were
not
arose
from
the
circle
of
what
composed
their
nobility
and
solemnly
shook
hands
with
the
general
those
next
in
rank
followed
his
example
the
pipe
was
then
smoked
and
the
general
had
to
take
a
whiff
when
it
came
his
turn
fortunately
we
escaped
the
speeches
for
we
had
not
brought
an
interpreter
coming
out
of
the
light
into
this
with
the
grotesque
figures
of
the
plebeians
as
they
danced
around
their
chiefs
and
contorted
their
bodies
to
the
sound
of
the
indian
drum
and
minor
notes
of
the
singers
made
it
something
unearthly
in
appearance
their
painted
faces
grunts
and
grins
of
serious
mirth
as
they
wheeled
around
the
tepee
made
me
shiver
how
relieved
i
felt
when
the
final
pipe
was
smoked
and
the
said
the
curious
eyes
of
the
squaws
who
stood
in
the
vicinity
of
the
lodge
followed
us
as
they
watched
me
clinging
to
the
general
s
arm
while
we
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
camp
through
the
thickening
gloom
as
we
went
farther
north
the
twilights
became
longer
and
i
was
greatly
deceived
by
having
so
much
daylight
every
morning
when
the
reveille
sounded
in
attempting
to
obey
its
summons
i
found
myself
actually
mystified
from
excessive
drowsiness
and
i
announced
my
resolve
to
go
to
bed
at
dark
as
was
often
my
custom
on
previous
marches
when
i
was
informed
that
we
had
marched
into
a
land
where
daylight
continues
into
the
night
hours
the
general
who
was
always
looking
at
the
curious
effects
in
the
heavens
delighted
in
the
clearness
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
myriads
of
stars
that
seemed
to
far
outnumber
all
we
had
ever
seen
in
other
skies
all
the
strange
phenomena
of
northern
climes
revealed
themselves
to
us
day
by
day
the
sun
and
moon
dogs
the
lunar
rainbows
and
sometimes
three
perfect
arcs
of
brilliant
color
formed
directly
above
us
in
the
heavens
as
we
made
our
day
s
march
through
spring
showers
the
storms
came
down
in
great
belts
of
rain
sometimes
and
if
the
country
were
level
enough
we
could
look
ahead
on
the
plain
and
see
where
the
storm
was
crossing
this
enabled
us
to
halt
in
time
to
escape
a
perfect
sheet
of
pouring
rain
which
fell
like
a
wall
of
water
directly
before
us
once
we
found
ourselves
in
the
midst
of
it
and
not
knowing
then
the
peculiarities
of
such
storms
we
took
our
drenching
philosophically
and
believed
that
it
was
like
too
many
others
that
had
kept
us
soaked
to
the
skin
for
hours
seeing
the
sun
shining
in
advance
on
the
plain
the
general
and
i
put
spurs
to
our
horses
and
rode
out
of
the
storm
to
perfectly
dry
ground
the
sun
came
down
on
us
so
hotly
that
we
were
soon
enveloped
in
a
halo
of
steam
from
our
drying
clothes
the
history
of
one
day
s
march
was
that
of
many
they
were
varied
by
small
misfortunes
over
which
we
amused
ourselves
but
which
were
very
serious
affairs
to
the
melancholy
ham
he
had
cooked
by
fireplaces
in
kentucky
but
never
having
lived
before
he
gained
his
experience
by
hard
trials
the
little
which
we
considered
such
a
treasure
was
placed
in
the
on
stormy
nights
and
the
bit
of
pipe
put
through
a
hole
in
the
canvas
had
an
elbow
so
that
it
could
be
turned
according
to
the
direction
of
the
wind
one
day
after
camp
was
the
general
saw
the
smoke
pouring
out
of
the
opening
of
the
and
hurried
to
see
what
was
the
matter
it
was
one
of
those
days
when
the
dakota
winds
like
those
of
kansas
blow
in
all
directions
poor
ham
was
barely
visible
in
the
dense
smoke
inside
the
tent
why
don
t
you
turn
the
pipe
the
general
called
above
the
tempest
and
ham
shouted
back
giniril
i
did
see
whar
she
s
p
intin
now
his
master
s
sides
shook
with
laughter
for
sure
enough
the
pipe
would
have
been
right
if
there
had
been
any
uniformity
in
the
course
of
the
wind
the
general
was
hungry
but
he
did
not
stop
to
complain
he
found
a
place
somewhat
sheltered
and
digging
a
hole
in
the
ground
taught
the
discouraged
darkey
how
to
build
a
fire
outside
at
last
we
sat
down
to
a
burned
smoky
meal
and
had
to
go
to
bed
hungry
another
day
when
there
was
a
small
tornado
we
began
to
wonder
why
dinner
was
delayed
we
looked
out
to
find
the
blown
flat
to
the
ground
the
general
ran
to
the
rescue
and
found
ham
interred
as
the
child
stories
buried
their
heroes
in
a
pot
of
he
had
been
thrown
among
skillets
and
kettles
and
the
dinner
was
scattered
over
him
the
general
helped
him
out
and
was
too
much
exhausted
with
laughter
over
the
old
fellow
s
exasperated
remarks
about
such
a
country
to
mind
the
delay
of
the
dinner
indeed
he
soothed
him
by
telling
him
to
wait
and
begin
again
when
the
wind
went
down
as
it
usually
does
when
the
sun
sets
one
day
we
caught
sight
of
our
american
flag
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
floating
over
a
little
group
of
buildings
inside
a
stockade
when
they
told
me
that
it
was
a
military
post
i
could
hardly
believe
it
possible
it
seemed
that
no
spot
could
be
more
utterly
desolate
then
i
remembered
having
met
an
officer
at
yankton
who
had
told
me
that
was
his
station
as
i
looked
at
his
fine
face
and
figure
i
could
not
help
thinking
how
thoroughly
some
woman
would
appreciate
him
thinking
aloud
i
said
that
i
hoped
he
had
improved
each
shining
hour
of
his
leave
of
absence
and
was
already
engaged
he
replied
that
i
would
see
his
post
as
we
went
up
the
river
and
then
might
comprehend
why
he
did
not
dare
ask
any
woman
to
be
his
wife
i
argued
that
if
some
girl
grew
fond
of
him
it
would
little
matter
to
her
where
she
went
if
it
were
only
by
her
husband
s
side
i
confess
however
that
when
i
saw
that
lonely
place
i
thought
that
it
would
require
extraordinary
devotion
to
follow
him
there
it
was
an
infantry
station
and
the
soldiers
barracks
officers
quarters
and
storehouses
were
huddled
together
inside
a
wall
made
of
logs
placed
perpendicularly
and
about
fifteen
feet
high
the
sand
was
so
deep
about
this
spot
that
nothing
could
be
made
to
grow
constant
gusts
of
wind
over
the
unprotected
plain
kept
little
clouds
of
fine
alkaline
dust
whirling
in
the
air
and
filling
the
eyes
and
mouth
not
a
tree
was
near
as
the
missouri
that
most
uncertain
of
rivers
kept
constantly
changing
its
channel
and
the
advancing
water
washed
away
great
hollows
in
the
banks
the
post
would
then
have
to
be
moved
farther
back
for
safety
the
soldiers
would
be
obliged
to
take
up
the
stockade
and
bury
the
logs
as
deep
as
they
could
to
keep
them
from
blowing
over
the
frail
buildings
built
upon
the
sand
rocked
and
swayed
in
the
wind
beside
the
forlorn
situation
of
this
garrison
no
one
could
go
outside
to
ride
or
hunt
without
peril
the
warlike
indians
considered
that
side
of
the
river
theirs
and
roamed
up
and
down
it
at
will
they
came
incessantly
to
the
small
sliding
panel
in
the
gates
of
the
stockade
and
made
demands
which
if
not
consented
to
were
followed
by
howls
of
rage
and
threatening
gestures
all
that
the
handful
of
men
could
do
was
to
conciliate
them
as
best
they
could
the
company
was
not
full
and
possibly
all
told
there
were
but
fifty
white
men
against
hundreds
of
indians
the
only
variety
in
their
lives
was
the
passing
of
an
occasional
steamer
in
the
brief
summer
then
settled
down
the
pitiless
winter
burying
them
in
snow
which
never
left
the
ground
until
late
in
the
spring
the
mail
only
reached
them
at
irregular
intervals
they
were
compelled
to
live
almost
entirely
on
commissary
stores
for
though
living
in
the
midst
of
game
it
was
too
hazardous
to
attempt
to
hunt
when
we
found
that
one
regiment
had
been
seven
years
on
the
river
and
some
of
the
officers
had
never
taken
leave
of
absence
it
seems
strange
that
any
one
stationed
at
such
a
post
had
not
gone
stark
mad
it
makes
me
proud
of
women
when
i
recall
the
fact
that
the
wife
of
an
officer
did
live
in
that
wretched
little
post
afterwards
and
did
not
complain
the
cavalry
turning
to
look
their
last
at
that
garrison
thanked
the
that
had
placed
them
in
a
branch
of
the
service
where
there
was
the
active
duty
of
campaigns
to
vary
a
life
otherwise
so
monotonous
the
dogs
had
almost
as
hard
a
time
to
become
accustomed
to
the
vagaries
of
a
dakota
climate
as
we
did
we
had
to
be
their
nurses
and
surgeons
in
our
large
pack
of
hounds
there
were
many
that
had
marked
individuality
of
character
not
many
days
could
be
passed
in
their
company
before
we
were
noticing
new
peculiarities
not
previously
observed
the
general
had
a
droll
fashion
as
we
rode
along
of
putting
words
into
their
mouths
when
they
got
into
trouble
fought
among
themselves
or
tried
to
lord
it
over
one
another
one
of
them
had
been
given
us
and
had
been
called
by
her
former
owner
lucy
in
vain
did
we
try
out
of
respect
for
the
life
of
the
useful
woman
for
whom
she
was
named
to
rechristen
the
dog
she
would
neither
listen
nor
obey
if
called
anything
else
i
can
see
her
now
sitting
deliberately
down
in
the
road
directly
in
front
of
us
and
holding
up
a
paw
full
of
cactus
thorns
the
general
would
say
there
sits
lucy
stone
and
she
is
saying
if
you
please
sir
since
you
chose
to
bring
me
into
a
land
of
bristling
earth
like
this
will
you
please
get
down
immediately
and
attend
to
my
foot
her
howls
and
upturned
eyes
meant
an
appeal
certainly
and
her
master
would
leap
to
the
ground
sit
down
in
the
road
and
taking
the
old
creature
in
his
arms
begin
the
surgery
he
carried
one
of
those
knives
that
had
many
adjuncts
and
with
the
tweezers
he
worked
tenderly
and
long
to
extract
the
tormenting
cactus
needles
lucy
was
a
complaining
old
dame
and
when
the
general
saw
her
sit
down
like
some
fat
old
woman
he
used
to
say
that
the
old
madam
was
telling
him
that
she
would
like
to
drive
a
bit
if
you
so
it
often
happened
that
my
was
the
hospital
for
an
ill
or
dog
the
general
had
to
stop
very
often
to
attend
to
the
wounded
paws
but
experience
taught
the
dogs
to
make
their
way
very
skilfully
where
the
cactus
grew
a
tripping
the
steps
of
instruction
could
not
have
moved
more
lightly
than
did
they
if
there
were
no
one
near
to
whom
they
could
appeal
in
the
human
way
those
dumb
things
have
they
learned
to
draw
out
the
offending
thorns
with
their
teeth
while
we
were
all
getting
accustomed
to
the
new
climate
it
was
of
no
use
to
try
to
keep
the
dogs
out
of
my
tent
they
stood
around
and
eyed
me
with
such
reproachful
looks
if
i
attempted
to
tie
up
the
entrance
to
the
tent
and
leave
them
out
if
it
were
very
cold
when
i
returned
from
the
i
found
dogs
under
and
on
the
and
so
thickly
scattered
over
the
floor
that
i
had
to
step
carefully
over
them
to
avoid
hurting
feet
or
tails
if
i
secured
a
place
in
the
bed
i
was
fortunate
sometimes
when
it
had
rained
and
all
of
them
were
wet
i
rebelled
the
steam
from
their
shaggy
coats
was
stifling
but
the
general
begged
so
hard
for
them
that
i
taught
myself
to
endure
the
air
at
last
i
never
questioned
the
right
of
the
puppies
to
everything
our
struggles
to
raise
them
and
to
avoid
the
distemper
which
goes
so
much
harder
with
blooded
than
with
cur
dogs
endeared
them
to
us
when
i
let
the
little
ones
in
it
was
really
comical
to
hear
my
husband
s
arguments
and
reasons
why
the
older
dogs
should
follow
a
plea
was
put
up
for
the
hound
that
had
fits
there
was
always
another
that
had
been
hurt
in
hunting
and
so
on
until
the
tent
would
hold
no
more
fortunately
in
pleasant
weather
i
was
let
off
with
only
the
ill
or
injured
ones
for
perpetual
companions
we
were
so
surrounded
with
dogs
when
they
were
resting
after
the
march
and
they
slept
so
soundly
from
fatigue
that
it
was
difficult
to
walk
about
without
stepping
on
them
my
favorite
a
great
was
named
he
never
gave
up
trying
to
be
my
he
was
enormous
and
yet
seemingly
unconscious
of
his
size
he
kept
up
a
perpetual
struggle
and
scramble
on
his
to
get
his
whole
body
up
on
my
lap
if
i
pieced
myself
out
with
a
to
support
him
he
closed
his
eyes
in
a
beatific
state
and
sighed
in
content
while
i
held
him
until
my
foot
went
to
sleep
and
i
was
cramped
with
his
weight
one
thing
that
made
me
so
fond
of
him
was
that
on
one
occasion
when
he
was
put
in
the
kennel
after
an
absence
he
was
almost
torn
to
pieces
by
the
other
dogs
he
was
a
brave
hound
but
he
was
at
fearful
odds
against
so
many
great
slices
of
flesh
were
torn
from
his
sides
and
gaping
wounds
made
by
the
teeth
showed
through
his
shaggy
coat
it
was
many
months
before
they
healed
though
the
is
gentle
with
human
beings
he
is
a
terrible
fighter
they
stand
on
their
and
facing
each
other
claw
and
tear
like
demons
it
was
always
necessary
to
watch
them
closely
when
a
new
dog
or
one
that
they
had
not
seen
for
some
time
was
put
in
their
midst
i
will
anticipate
a
moment
and
speak
of
the
final
fate
of
cardigan
when
i
left
fort
lincoln
i
asked
some
one
to
look
out
for
his
welfare
and
send
him
as
soon
as
possible
to
a
clergyman
who
had
been
my
husband
s
friend
my
request
was
complied
with
and
afterwards
when
the
poor
old
dog
died
his
new
master
honored
him
by
having
his
body
set
up
by
the
taxidermist
and
a
place
was
given
him
in
one
of
the
public
buildings
in
minneapolis
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
he
was
worthy
of
the
tribute
not
only
because
of
the
testimony
thus
given
to
the
friendship
of
the
people
for
his
master
but
because
he
was
the
bravest
and
most
faithful
of
animals
most
of
the
country
passed
over
in
our
route
belonged
to
the
indian
reservations
and
the
government
was
endeavoring
to
teach
the
tribes
settled
there
to
cultivate
the
soil
they
had
hunted
off
most
of
the
game
an
occasional
the
plover
and
a
few
wild
ducks
were
all
that
were
left
i
must
not
forget
the
maddening
curlew
it
was
not
good
eating
but
it
was
always
exciting
to
see
one
there
never
was
a
more
exasperating
bird
to
shoot
time
and
again
a
successful
shot
was
prophesied
and
i
was
called
to
be
a
witness
only
to
see
finally
the
surprise
of
the
general
when
the
wily
bird
soared
calmly
away
i
believe
no
person
was
able
to
bring
one
down
during
the
entire
trip
as
we
approached
an
indian
village
the
chiefs
came
out
to
receive
us
there
were
many
words
of
welcome
translated
by
our
guide
who
having
lived
among
them
many
years
knew
the
different
dialects
the
government
had
built
some
comfortable
for
them
in
many
of
which
i
would
have
lived
gladly
the
indians
did
not
care
for
them
complaining
that
they
had
coughs
if
they
occupied
a
house
a
tepee
was
put
up
alongside
in
which
one
or
two
families
lived
while
little
low
lodges
looking
like
the
soldiers
were
used
for
the
young
men
of
the
circle
to
sleep
in
the
tools
and
stores
given
by
the
government
were
packed
away
in
the
otherwise
empty
houses
chapter
vi
a
visit
to
the
village
of
two
a
sioux
chief
called
two
bears
had
the
most
picturesque
village
that
we
saw
the
lodges
were
placed
in
a
circle
as
this
was
judged
the
most
defensive
position
the
ponies
were
herded
inside
the
enclosure
at
night
this
precaution
was
necessary
for
the
neighboring
tribes
swept
down
on
them
after
dark
and
ran
off
the
stock
if
they
were
not
secured
as
we
dismounted
we
saw
an
old
man
standing
alone
in
the
circle
apparently
unconscious
of
everything
as
he
recounted
some
war
tale
in
loud
monotonous
tones
he
had
no
listeners
all
were
intently
watching
the
approaching
regiment
still
the
venerable
sioux
went
on
as
persistently
as
if
he
were
looking
upon
a
sea
of
upturned
he
was
the
or
oracle
of
the
tribe
or
possibly
the
of
the
village
for
the
guide
told
us
he
sang
of
the
deeds
of
valor
of
his
people
far
back
in
history
just
outside
of
the
village
the
chiefs
sat
in
a
circle
awaiting
us
two
bears
arose
to
welcome
the
general
and
asked
him
to
go
with
him
to
his
lodge
i
was
asked
to
go
also
and
be
presented
to
miss
two
bears
for
she
was
too
royal
in
birth
to
be
permitted
outside
and
it
was
not
in
keeping
with
the
dignity
of
her
rank
to
mingle
with
the
others
the
guide
afterwards
explained
to
us
the
honor
of
going
alone
into
the
tepee
was
one
that
i
could
have
foregone
for
my
courage
was
much
greater
if
i
did
my
indian
surrounded
by
the
regiment
the
general
fearing
their
might
be
offended
if
i
declined
the
invitation
whispered
an
encouraging
word
and
we
dipped
our
heads
and
crept
into
the
tepee
the
chief
was
a
dignified
old
man
wrapped
in
his
blanket
without
the
usual
addition
of
some
portion
of
citizen
s
dress
which
the
indians
believe
adds
to
their
grandeur
his
daughter
also
was
in
complete
squaw
s
costume
her
feet
were
moccasined
her
legs
and
ankles
wound
round
with
beaded
leggings
and
she
had
on
the
one
buckskin
garment
which
never
varies
in
cut
through
all
the
tribes
a
blanket
drawn
over
her
head
was
belted
at
her
waist
to
crown
all
this
however
she
had
an
open
parasol
brought
to
her
doubtless
as
a
present
by
some
indian
returning
from
a
council
at
washington
she
held
it
with
dignity
as
if
it
might
be
to
her
as
much
an
insignia
of
state
as
the
mace
of
the
fortunately
they
did
not
ask
us
to
sit
down
and
partake
of
jerked
beef
or
to
smoke
the
pipe
so
we
soon
got
through
our
compliments
and
returned
to
the
outer
entrance
of
the
village
here
the
tribe
were
assembled
and
evidently
attired
in
in
our
honor
we
were
most
interested
in
the
village
belle
and
the
placid
manner
in
which
she
permitted
us
to
walk
around
her
gazing
and
talking
her
good
points
over
showed
that
she
expected
homage
she
sat
on
a
scarlet
blanket
spread
on
the
ground
and
over
her
stretched
from
poles
was
another
for
an
awning
she
was
loaded
with
ornaments
row
after
row
of
beads
about
her
neck
broad
armlets
and
anklets
of
brass
pinchbeck
rings
and
a
soft
buckskin
dress
and
leggings
heavily
embroidered
her
ears
were
pierced
twice
on
the
side
as
well
as
in
the
lobe
and
from
these
holes
were
suspended
circles
of
gilt
her
bright
eyes
the
satin
smoothness
of
her
hair
and
the
clear
brown
of
the
skin
made
a
pretty
picture
there
was
no
attempt
to
blend
into
the
brown
the
bright
patch
of
carmine
on
each
cheek
only
extreme
youth
and
its
ever
attractive
charms
can
make
one
forget
the
heavy
square
shape
of
indian
faces
and
their
coarse
features
it
was
surprising
to
see
all
the
other
squaws
giving
up
the
field
to
this
one
so
completely
they
crouched
near
with
a
sort
of
look
and
did
not
even
dispute
her
sway
by
making
coy
eyes
as
we
spoke
to
them
there
were
but
few
young
men
their
absence
was
always
excused
by
the
same
reason
they
were
out
hunting
we
knew
how
little
game
there
was
and
surmised
what
we
afterwards
found
to
be
true
that
they
had
joined
the
hostile
tribes
and
only
came
in
to
the
distribution
of
supplies
and
presents
in
the
fall
a
few
rods
from
the
village
a
tripod
of
poles
was
set
in
the
ground
and
lashed
to
it
the
indian
s
shield
made
of
the
hide
of
the
buffalo
where
it
is
thickest
about
the
neck
there
were
rude
paintings
and
indian
hieroglyphics
covering
it
the
shield
is
an
heirloom
with
the
indian
and
the
one
selected
to
hang
out
in
this
manner
has
always
the
greatest
war
record
one
of
their
superstitions
is
that
it
keeps
away
enemies
these
nomads
had
some
idea
of
luxury
for
i
recollect
seeing
some
of
them
reclining
on
a
kind
of
rest
made
of
a
framework
of
pliable
rods
over
which
was
stretched
buckskin
afterwards
i
found
how
comfortable
such
contrivances
were
for
one
was
given
me
the
slope
is
so
gradual
that
you
half
recline
and
can
read
with
great
ease
when
we
had
reached
camp
and
were
taking
our
afternoon
siesta
the
same
day
with
the
tent
walls
raised
for
air
we
were
roused
by
the
sound
of
music
looking
off
over
the
bluffs
we
saw
a
large
body
of
indians
approaching
on
ponies
while
squaws
and
children
ran
beside
them
it
was
the
prompt
response
of
two
bears
to
the
general
s
invitation
to
return
his
call
the
warriors
stopped
near
camp
and
dismounting
advanced
towards
us
the
squaws
unbridled
and
picketed
the
ponies
and
made
themselves
comfortable
by
arranging
impromptu
shades
of
the
bright
blankets
they
staked
down
two
corners
closely
to
the
ground
and
propped
up
the
others
with
poles
stuck
in
the
sod
when
the
indians
came
up
to
us
the
council
was
as
usual
begun
the
pipe
being
smoked
two
bears
gave
us
a
eulogy
of
himself
he
then
demanded
in
behalf
of
the
tribe
payment
for
the
use
of
the
ground
on
which
we
were
encamped
and
also
for
the
grass
consumed
though
it
was
too
short
to
get
more
than
an
occasional
tuft
he
ended
as
they
all
do
with
a
request
for
food
the
general
in
reply
vaguely
referred
them
to
the
great
father
in
payment
for
the
use
of
their
land
but
presented
them
with
a
beef
in
return
for
their
hospitality
only
half
satisfied
they
stalked
away
one
by
one
we
watched
them
at
a
distance
kill
and
divide
the
beef
it
surprised
us
to
see
how
they
despatched
it
and
that
hardly
a
vestige
of
it
was
left
many
of
the
indians
coming
from
reservations
carried
papers
which
they
valued
and
carefully
guarded
after
burrowing
under
robe
and
shirt
something
was
produced
wrapped
in
layers
of
soiled
cotton
cloth
it
was
a
recommendation
of
them
obtained
from
some
officer
or
indian
agent
this
was
presented
on
entering
as
their
letter
of
introduction
most
of
these
papers
read
very
much
the
same
way
giving
the
indian
s
name
it
stated
that
he
had
been
living
on
the
reservation
for
a
certain
length
of
time
that
he
was
friendly
to
the
whites
etc
one
of
our
guests
that
day
carried
something
a
little
different
he
was
called
medicine
lingering
behind
the
rest
he
presented
his
letter
with
perfect
good
faith
and
great
pomposity
some
wag
had
composed
it
and
it
read
something
like
this
medicine
jo
says
he
is
a
good
indian
that
you
can
trust
him
if
he
is
he
is
the
first
i
have
ever
seen
and
in
my
opinion
he
like
all
the
rest
will
bear
it
was
all
the
general
could
do
to
keep
his
face
straight
as
he
handed
back
to
the
unconscious
owner
this
little
libel
on
himself
the
interpreter
kept
constantly
before
us
the
fine
post
that
we
were
approaching
and
the
last
day
before
we
reached
there
it
was
visible
for
a
long
distance
the
atmosphere
of
dakota
was
so
deceptive
that
we
imagined
ourselves
within
a
few
miles
of
the
garrison
when
in
reality
there
was
a
march
of
long
miles
before
us
our
road
led
up
from
the
river
valley
on
the
high
bluffs
and
sometimes
followed
along
the
backbone
of
hills
from
which
on
either
side
we
looked
down
a
great
distance
there
was
barely
room
for
the
occasionally
i
had
been
obliged
to
take
refuge
from
the
cold
for
a
little
while
and
drive
our
were
tiny
little
dots
and
i
soon
discovered
that
they
were
completely
demoralized
at
the
sight
of
an
indian
they
could
see
one
in
advance
long
before
the
driver
could
a
sudden
shying
and
quick
turning
of
these
agile
little
brutes
a
general
tangle
of
themselves
in
the
harness
and
legs
of
the
wheelers
loud
shouts
of
the
driver
and
a
quick
downfall
of
his
foot
on
the
brake
to
keep
us
from
overturning
made
an
exciting
nothing
would
get
them
righted
and
started
again
they
would
have
to
be
unharnessed
and
the
rebellious
pair
tied
to
the
rear
of
the
wagon
until
we
had
gone
far
beyond
the
object
of
terror
part
of
the
day
that
we
were
following
the
wanderings
of
the
road
alongside
hills
and
over
the
narrow
smooth
level
of
the
i
was
compelled
to
drive
and
i
watched
anxiously
the
ears
of
these
wretched
little
beasts
to
see
if
they
expressed
any
sentiment
of
fright
we
came
to
such
steep
descents
the
brake
holding
the
wheels
seemed
of
no
use
looking
down
from
the
wagon
on
to
the
mules
below
us
we
appeared
to
be
in
the
position
of
flies
on
a
wall
as
we
came
to
one
descent
more
awful
than
the
rest
the
general
who
was
always
near
rode
up
to
the
carriage
and
told
me
not
to
be
afraid
for
he
would
order
the
wheels
manned
the
escort
of
over
a
hundred
men
dismounting
attached
ropes
to
the
wheels
and
held
on
with
all
their
strength
while
i
went
down
the
steepest
declivity
i
had
ever
descended
after
that
i
begged
to
get
out
and
the
general
carried
me
to
a
bank
and
set
me
down
where
i
could
watch
the
repairing
of
the
road
he
took
off
his
coat
and
joined
the
soldiers
in
carrying
logs
and
shovelling
earth
for
they
were
obliged
to
fill
up
the
soft
bed
of
the
stream
before
the
command
could
cross
it
took
a
long
time
and
much
patience
but
the
general
enjoyed
it
all
and
often
helped
when
the
crossings
needed
to
be
prepared
when
the
logs
were
all
laid
i
had
to
laugh
at
the
energy
he
showed
in
cracking
a
whip
he
borrowed
from
a
teamster
and
shouting
to
the
mules
to
urge
them
to
pull
through
where
there
was
danger
of
their
stalling
when
the
road
was
completed
i
was
ready
to
mount
my
horse
for
it
seemed
to
me
preferable
to
die
from
accident
surrounded
with
friends
than
to
expire
alone
in
the
the
ascent
was
rendered
so
wet
and
slippery
the
general
feared
my
saddle
would
turn
and
i
was
once
more
shut
in
by
myself
the
soldiers
again
manned
the
wheels
to
prevent
the
carriage
sliding
back
the
mules
scrambled
and
with
the
aid
of
language
prepared
expressly
for
them
we
reached
the
summit
the
driver
had
named
the
bettie
and
jane
and
when
they
were
over
their
tempers
he
petted
and
caressed
them
their
repeated
rebellion
at
last
wore
out
even
his
patience
one
morning
i
noticed
new
leaders
but
the
imperturbable
face
of
the
driver
gave
no
hint
of
his
successful
plotting
mary
told
me
however
that
he
was
worn
out
with
his
struggles
and
had
gone
after
dark
into
the
herd
of
mules
with
bettie
and
jane
and
as
he
expressed
it
lost
he
selected
two
more
from
among
those
belonging
to
the
and
returned
triumphant
over
his
premeditated
exchange
he
carefully
reclipped
their
manes
and
tails
and
disguised
them
still
further
with
blotches
of
black
paint
to
give
them
a
mottled
appearance
when
the
other
teamster
prepared
to
harness
in
the
morning
of
course
he
discovered
the
fraud
perpetrated
on
him
there
was
no
redress
then
and
he
had
to
take
out
his
wrath
in
language
more
forcible
than
elegant
which
the
teamsters
have
adapted
expressly
for
extreme
occasions
our
driver
told
mary
with
a
chuckle
that
with
a
command
of
many
hundred
men
waiting
for
a
teamster
to
harness
he
found
no
time
for
swapping
burkman
the
soldier
who
took
care
of
our
horses
was
a
man
so
deliberate
in
speech
and
slow
in
his
movements
he
seemed
as
incongruous
among
the
spirited
cavalrymen
as
would
be
an
farmer
early
in
the
march
i
had
heard
him
coughing
as
he
groomed
the
horses
when
i
asked
if
he
had
done
anything
for
his
cold
he
replied
bottle
after
bottle
of
stuff
mum
but
it
don
t
do
no
good
so
i
begged
the
surgeon
to
look
more
carefully
into
his
case
he
made
an
examination
and
told
me
as
the
result
that
the
man
must
have
only
light
work
and
nourishing
food
after
that
i
asked
mary
to
save
everything
for
burkman
and
make
his
recovery
her
especial
care
the
officers
made
fun
of
me
as
they
were
rather
incredulous
and
thought
a
bit
of
shamming
was
being
practised
on
me
but
i
knew
better
they
never
failed
to
comment
and
smile
when
they
saw
the
old
defender
of
his
country
coming
out
of
the
his
jaws
working
and
his
mouth
full
while
he
carried
all
the
food
his
hands
would
hold
to
tell
the
truth
he
kept
up
this
prescription
of
nourishing
food
long
after
he
had
quite
recovered
it
became
the
delight
of
my
husband
and
the
officers
to
chaff
me
about
old
nutriment
for
such
was
the
sobriquet
they
gave
him
at
last
even
mary
began
to
narrate
how
he
swept
everything
before
him
with
voracious
convalescing
appetite
why
miss
libbie
she
said
to
me
one
day
i
thought
i
d
try
him
with
a
can
of
raw
tomatoes
and
set
them
before
him
asking
if
he
was
fond
of
them
and
he
just
drawled
out
and
the
tomatoes
were
gone
in
no
his
laconic
answer
passed
into
a
proverb
with
us
all
when
invited
to
partake
of
anything
we
liked
such
a
tender
heart
as
that
old
soldier
had
i
had
noticed
this
first
in
kentucky
my
horse
which
i
prized
above
all
that
i
have
ever
ridden
died
during
my
temporary
absence
from
home
i
was
too
greatly
grieved
to
ask
many
questions
about
him
but
one
day
some
time
afterwards
when
we
were
riding
through
a
charming
bit
of
country
burkman
approached
me
from
the
place
where
he
usually
rode
behind
us
and
said
i
d
like
to
tell
custer
there
s
whar
poor
phil
lies
i
picked
the
purtiest
place
i
could
find
for
and
he
had
indeed
for
the
green
valley
under
trees
would
have
gone
far
to
reconcile
many
a
weary
human
heart
to
be
placed
under
the
sod
we
thought
we
had
made
the
first
step
towards
savage
life
when
burkman
brought
the
mother
of
the
one
baby
of
our
regiment
the
dried
vertebra
of
a
rattlesnake
that
he
killed
because
he
had
heard
that
it
was
the
best
of
anything
on
which
the
infant
could
cut
its
teeth
i
had
made
some
scarlet
flannel
shirts
for
my
husband
s
use
on
the
summer
campaign
and
he
was
as
much
pleased
as
possible
beginning
at
once
to
wear
them
not
many
days
march
proved
to
me
what
an
error
i
had
made
the
bright
red
color
could
be
seen
for
miles
when
the
form
itself
was
almost
lost
on
the
horizon
i
had
to
coax
to
get
them
away
again
and
replace
them
with
the
dark
blue
that
he
usually
wore
though
i
triumphed
i
was
met
with
a
perfect
fusillade
of
teasing
when
i
presented
the
red
shirts
to
burkman
the
officers
of
course
hearing
all
the
discussion
over
the
subject
as
no
trifle
was
too
small
to
interest
us
in
one
another
s
affairs
attacked
me
at
once
if
i
had
been
so
anxious
to
protect
the
general
from
wearing
anything
that
would
attract
the
eye
of
the
vigilant
indian
on
the
coming
campaign
why
should
i
be
so
willing
to
sacrifice
the
life
of
old
nutriment
they
made
no
impression
on
me
however
for
they
knew
as
well
as
i
did
that
the
soldier
though
so
faithful
was
not
made
of
that
stuff
that
seeks
to
lead
a
balaklava
charge
my
husband
and
i
were
so
attached
to
him
and
appreciated
so
deeply
his
fidelity
we
could
not
thank
the
enough
that
gave
us
one
so
loyal
to
our
interests
before
we
reached
the
post
we
were
approaching
the
commandant
sent
out
ice
for
our
use
and
the
despatches
of
the
associated
press
the
general
was
greatly
delighted
to
get
news
of
events
that
had
occurred
all
over
the
world
in
this
far
distant
land
we
found
afterwards
that
the
officers
joined
in
paying
for
the
despatches
the
indians
had
such
a
superstition
about
molesting
the
wires
that
the
lines
ran
through
even
the
most
dangerous
country
i
can
hardly
say
how
good
it
seemed
to
us
to
see
a
again
we
were
not
surprised
after
seeing
the
other
posts
below
on
the
river
that
the
guide
had
praised
fort
sully
it
was
the
of
one
of
the
infantry
regiments
and
the
commanding
officer
had
been
at
the
post
long
enough
to
put
it
in
excellent
order
it
was
situated
on
an
open
plateau
from
which
there
was
an
extensive
view
below
in
the
valley
the
companies
had
gardens
and
they
also
kept
cows
pigs
and
chickens
we
looked
upon
all
this
as
an
el
dorado
and
the
thought
of
remaining
long
enough
at
one
fort
to
get
any
good
out
of
a
garden
was
simply
unknown
in
our
vagrant
existence
our
camp
was
very
near
the
post
on
the
same
open
plain
without
trees
or
shelter
we
were
received
with
genuine
hospitality
and
finally
all
of
us
invited
to
luncheon
the
ladies
came
up
from
the
steamer
and
the
large
house
was
filled
with
happy
people
the
post
band
played
outside
on
the
while
we
lunched
we
had
nine
kinds
of
game
on
the
table
some
of
it
was
new
to
us
the
beaver
tail
for
instance
but
it
was
so
like
pork
and
so
fat
i
could
only
taste
it
we
had
in
addition
antelope
elk
buffalo
tongue
wild
turkey
deer
wild
goose
plover
and
duck
the
goose
was
a
sort
of
fatted
calf
for
us
the
soldiers
had
caught
it
while
young
and
by
constantly
clipping
its
wings
had
kept
it
from
joining
the
flocks
which
its
cries
often
brought
circling
around
the
post
at
last
it
began
to
make
the
life
of
the
chickens
a
burden
to
them
and
we
arrived
in
time
to
enjoy
the
delicious
bird
served
with
jelly
made
from
the
tart
wild
bullberries
that
grew
near
the
river
the
bread
delightful
cake
tender
ham
of
the
garrison
s
own
curing
and
the
sweets
made
with
cream
fresh
butter
and
eggs
three
luxuries
with
us
proved
that
it
is
possible
for
army
people
to
live
in
comfort
if
they
do
not
belong
to
a
mounted
regiment
still
though
they
had
a
band
and
a
good
library
belonging
to
the
regiment
the
thought
of
being
walled
in
with
snow
and
completely
isolated
for
eight
months
of
the
year
made
me
shudder
the
post
was
midway
between
yankton
and
bismarck
each
the
termination
of
a
railroad
and
each
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
away
the
wife
of
the
commanding
officer
was
known
throughout
the
department
for
her
lovely
christian
character
and
the
contented
life
she
led
under
all
circumstances
i
was
much
amused
at
her
account
of
her
repeated
trials
in
trying
to
secure
a
permanent
governess
she
said
all
the
posts
along
the
river
seemed
to
know
intuitively
when
a
new
one
arrived
from
the
east
the
young
officers
found
more
imperative
duties
calling
them
to
fort
sully
than
they
had
dreamed
of
in
a
year
before
long
the
governess
began
to
be
abstracted
and
watch
longingly
for
the
mails
a
ring
would
next
appear
on
the
significant
first
finger
and
be
the
forerunner
of
a
request
to
allow
her
to
resign
her
place
this
had
happened
four
times
when
i
met
our
hostess
and
though
she
was
glad
to
furnish
the
officers
with
wives
she
rather
sighed
for
a
woman
who
though
possessing
every
accomplishment
might
still
be
so
antiquated
and
ugly
that
she
could
be
sure
to
keep
her
for
a
time
at
least
the
commandant
had
some
fine
greyhounds
and
joining
the
general
with
his
packs
of
stag
and
fox
hounds
they
had
several
hunts
in
the
few
days
that
remained
of
course
after
so
bright
a
visit
and
such
a
feast
it
was
hard
to
begin
again
on
the
march
with
biscuit
and
tough
beef
the
cattle
that
supplied
us
with
meat
were
driven
along
on
the
march
and
killed
every
other
day
and
could
not
be
expected
to
be
in
very
good
condition
the
interest
of
our
journey
however
made
us
soon
forget
all
deprivations
grateful
sentiments
towards
those
who
had
been
so
kind
to
us
as
strangers
remained
as
a
memory
chapter
vii
adventures
during
the
last
days
of
the
march
my
husband
and
i
kept
up
our
little
by
ourselves
as
we
neared
the
hour
for
camping
each
day
one
day
one
of
the
officers
accompanied
us
we
left
the
higher
ground
to
go
down
by
the
water
and
have
the
luxury
of
wandering
through
the
that
sometimes
fringed
the
river
for
several
miles
as
usual
we
had
a
number
of
dogs
leaping
and
racing
around
us
two
of
them
started
a
deer
and
the
general
bounded
after
them
encouraging
the
others
with
his
voice
to
follow
he
had
left
his
friend
with
me
and
we
rode
leisurely
along
to
see
that
the
younger
dogs
did
not
get
lost
without
the
least
warning
in
the
dead
stillness
of
that
desolate
spot
we
suddenly
came
upon
a
group
of
young
indian
warriors
seated
in
their
motionless
way
in
the
underbrush
i
became
perfectly
cold
and
numb
with
terror
my
danger
in
connection
with
the
indians
was
twofold
i
was
in
peril
from
death
or
capture
by
the
savages
and
liable
to
be
killed
by
my
own
friends
to
prevent
my
capture
during
the
five
years
i
had
been
with
the
regiment
in
kansas
i
had
marched
many
hundred
miles
sometimes
i
had
to
join
my
husband
going
across
a
dangerous
country
and
the
exposure
from
indians
all
those
years
had
been
constant
i
had
been
a
subject
of
conversation
among
the
officers
being
the
only
woman
who
as
a
rule
followed
the
regiment
and
without
discussing
it
much
in
my
presence
the
universal
understanding
was
that
any
one
having
me
in
charge
in
an
emergency
where
there
was
imminent
danger
of
my
capture
should
shoot
me
instantly
while
i
knew
that
i
was
defended
by
strong
hands
and
brave
hearts
the
thought
of
the
double
danger
always
flashed
into
my
mind
when
we
were
in
jeopardy
if
time
could
have
been
measured
by
sensations
a
cycle
seemed
to
have
passed
in
those
few
seconds
the
indians
snatched
up
their
guns
leaped
upon
their
ponies
and
prepared
for
attack
the
officer
with
me
was
perfectly
calm
spoke
to
them
coolly
without
a
change
of
voice
and
rode
quickly
beside
me
telling
me
to
advance
my
horse
reared
violently
at
first
sight
of
the
indians
and
started
to
run
gladly
would
i
have
put
him
to
his
mettle
then
except
for
the
instinct
of
obedience
which
any
one
following
a
regiment
acquires
in
all
that
pertains
to
military
directions
the
general
was
just
visible
ascending
a
bluff
beyond
to
avoid
showing
fear
when
every
nerve
is
strung
to
its
utmost
and
your
heart
leaps
into
your
throat
requires
effort
i
managed
to
check
my
horse
and
did
not
scream
no
amount
of
telling
over
to
myself
what
i
had
been
told
that
all
the
tribes
on
this
side
were
peaceable
and
that
only
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
were
warlike
could
quell
the
throbbing
of
my
pulses
indians
were
indians
to
me
and
i
knew
well
that
it
was
a
matter
of
no
time
to
cross
and
recross
on
their
little
boats
that
shoot
madly
down
the
tide
what
made
me
sure
that
these
warriors
whom
we
had
just
met
were
from
the
fighting
bands
was
the
recollection
of
some
significant
signs
we
had
come
upon
in
the
road
a
few
days
previous
stakes
had
been
set
in
the
ground
with
bits
of
red
flannel
fastened
on
them
peculiarly
this
the
guide
explained
meant
warnings
from
the
tribes
at
war
to
frighten
us
from
any
further
advance
into
their
country
whether
because
of
the
coolness
of
the
officer
or
because
the
warriors
knew
of
the
size
of
the
advancing
column
we
were
allowed
to
proceed
unharmed
how
interminable
the
distance
seemed
to
where
the
general
awaited
us
unconscious
of
what
we
had
encountered
i
was
lifted
out
of
the
saddle
a
very
limp
and
unconscious
thing
encouraged
by
references
to
other
dangers
i
had
lived
through
without
flinching
i
mounted
again
and
followed
the
leader
closely
he
took
us
through
some
rough
country
where
the
ambitious
horses
finding
that
by
bending
their
heads
they
could
squeeze
through
forgot
to
seek
openings
high
enough
to
admit
those
sitting
in
the
saddle
we
crashed
through
underbrush
and
i
with
habit
torn
and
hands
scratched
was
sometimes
almost
lifted
up
by
the
resisting
branches
often
we
had
no
path
and
the
general
s
horse
vic
would
start
straight
up
steep
banks
after
we
had
forded
streams
it
never
occurred
to
his
rider
until
after
the
ascent
was
made
and
a
faint
voice
arose
from
the
valley
that
all
horses
would
not
do
willingly
what
his
did
he
finally
turned
to
look
back
and
tell
me
how
to
manage
my
horse
i
abandoned
the
bridle
when
we
came
to
those
ascents
and
wound
my
hands
in
the
horse
s
mane
to
keep
from
sliding
entirely
off
while
the
animal
took
his
own
way
all
this
was
such
variety
and
excitement
i
was
delighted
and
forgot
my
terror
of
the
morning
we
found
a
bit
of
lovely
road
which
only
those
who
go
hundreds
of
miles
under
a
blazing
sun
can
appreciate
fully
the
sunshine
came
flickering
down
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
and
covered
the
short
grass
with
checkered
light
and
shade
here
we
dawdled
and
enjoyed
looking
up
at
the
patches
of
blue
sky
through
great
it
was
like
a
bit
of
woods
at
home
where
i
never
thought
to
be
grateful
for
foliage
but
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
my
husband
remembered
my
having
put
some
biscuit
in
the
leather
pocket
on
my
saddle
and
invited
himself
to
luncheon
at
once
we
dismounted
and
threw
ourselves
on
the
ground
to
eat
the
very
frugal
fare
after
resting
we
gave
ourselves
the
privilege
of
a
swift
gallop
over
the
stretch
of
smooth
ground
before
us
we
were
laughing
and
talking
so
busily
i
never
noticed
the
surroundings
until
i
found
we
were
almost
in
the
midst
of
an
indian
village
quite
hidden
under
a
bluff
my
heart
literally
stood
still
i
watched
the
general
furtively
he
was
as
usual
perfectly
unmoved
and
yet
he
well
knew
that
this
was
the
country
where
it
was
hardly
considered
that
the
indian
was
overburdened
with
hospitality
oh
how
i
wished
ourselves
safely
with
the
column
now
so
far
away
there
were
but
few
occupants
of
the
village
but
they
glowered
and
growled
and
i
could
see
the
venomous
glances
they
cast
on
us
as
i
meekly
followed
i
trembled
so
i
could
barely
keep
my
seat
as
we
slowly
advanced
for
the
general
even
slackened
his
speed
to
demonstrate
to
them
i
suppose
that
we
felt
ourselves
perfectly
at
home
he
said
how
of
course
which
was
his
usual
salutation
to
them
an
echoing
how
beside
him
proved
that
i
still
had
power
of
utterance
when
we
came
to
one
indian
who
looked
menacingly
at
us
and
doggedly
stood
in
our
road
the
officer
with
us
declared
that
i
accompanied
my
how
with
a
salaam
so
deep
that
it
bent
my
head
down
to
the
pommel
of
my
saddle
at
all
events
i
meant
if
politeness
would
propitiate
not
to
be
deficient
in
that
quality
at
such
a
critical
moment
in
a
few
moments
which
seemed
however
a
lifetime
we
saw
the
reason
why
the
village
appeared
so
empty
men
women
and
children
had
gone
nearly
to
the
top
of
the
bluff
and
there
with
their
bodies
hidden
were
looking
off
at
a
faint
cloud
of
dust
in
the
distance
my
husband
appreciating
my
terror
quickly
assured
me
it
was
the
cavalry
even
then
what
a
stretch
of
country
it
seemed
between
us
and
that
blessed
veil
of
sand
through
which
we
perceived
dimly
that
succor
was
at
hand
my
horse
was
rather
given
to
snuggling
and
pressed
so
against
the
general
that
he
made
his
leg
very
uncomfortable
sometimes
but
then
in
my
terror
it
seemed
to
me
an
ocean
of
space
was
dividing
us
i
longed
for
the
old
puritan
days
when
a
wife
rode
on
a
pillion
behind
her
liege
as
a
matter
of
course
i
found
courage
to
look
back
at
last
the
bluff
was
crowned
with
little
irregularities
so
still
they
seemed
like
tufts
of
grass
or
stones
they
represented
many
pairs
of
eyes
that
peered
over
the
country
at
the
advancing
troops
the
next
day
the
general
thought
i
might
rather
not
go
with
him
than
run
the
risk
of
such
frights
but
i
well
knew
there
was
something
far
worse
than
fears
for
my
own
personal
safety
it
is
infinitely
worse
to
be
left
behind
a
prey
to
all
the
horrors
of
imagining
what
may
be
happening
to
one
we
love
you
eat
your
heart
slowly
out
with
anxiety
and
to
endure
such
suspense
is
simply
the
hardest
of
all
trials
that
come
to
the
soldier
s
wife
i
gladly
consented
to
be
taken
along
every
day
but
there
never
seemed
a
time
when
it
was
not
necessary
to
get
accustomed
to
some
new
terror
however
it
is
only
the
getting
used
to
it
that
is
so
bad
it
is
the
unexpected
things
that
require
fresh
relays
of
courage
when
a
woman
has
come
out
of
danger
she
is
too
utterly
a
coward
by
nature
not
to
dread
enduring
the
same
thing
again
but
it
is
something
to
know
that
she
is
equal
to
it
though
she
may
tremble
and
grow
faint
in
anticipation
having
once
been
through
it
she
can
count
on
rising
to
the
situation
when
the
hour
actually
comes
the
rattlesnakes
were
so
numerous
on
this
march
that
all
texas
and
kansas
experience
seemed
to
dwarf
in
contrast
my
horse
was
over
sixteen
hands
high
but
i
would
gladly
have
exchanged
him
for
a
camelopard
when
i
rode
suddenly
almost
upon
a
snake
coiled
in
the
grass
and
looked
down
into
the
eyes
of
the
upraised
head
we
counted
those
we
encountered
in
one
day
s
journey
until
we
were
tired
the
men
became
very
expert
and
systematic
in
clearing
the
camp
of
these
reptiles
if
we
halted
at
night
in
the
underbrush
they
cut
and
tore
away
the
reeds
and
grass
and
began
at
once
to
beat
the
ground
and
kill
the
snakes
when
i
say
that
as
many
as
forty
were
killed
in
one
night
some
literal
person
may
ask
if
i
actually
saw
the
bodies
of
all
those
lately
slain
it
is
not
an
exaggerated
story
however
and
one
only
needs
to
see
hundreds
of
men
pounding
and
clearing
such
a
place
to
realize
that
many
snakes
could
be
disposed
of
in
a
short
time
after
that
when
the
ground
was
selected
for
our
camp
in
the
low
part
of
the
valley
i
was
loath
to
lie
down
and
sleep
until
the
soldiers
had
come
up
to
prepare
the
ground
my
husband
used
to
indulge
this
little
prejudice
of
mine
against
making
my
head
a
reproduction
of
medusa
s
and
we
often
sought
the
high
ground
for
a
rest
until
the
command
came
up
the
guide
rode
often
at
the
head
of
the
column
and
we
found
him
full
of
information
about
the
country
we
began
also
to
listen
for
a
new
domestic
disclosure
every
time
we
approached
an
indian
village
he
was
the
most
married
of
any
man
i
ever
saw
for
in
every
tribe
he
had
a
wife
still
this
superfluity
did
not
burden
him
for
the
ceremony
of
tying
a
marital
knot
in
the
far
west
is
simple
and
the
wives
support
themselves
sometimes
he
gave
us
new
points
about
making
ourselves
comfortable
in
camp
one
day
i
was
very
grateful
to
him
we
were
far
in
advance
of
the
containing
the
tents
the
sun
was
scorching
not
a
tree
nor
even
a
clump
of
bushes
was
near
in
a
brief
time
however
the
guide
had
returned
from
the
stream
where
he
had
cut
some
willow
saplings
and
sticking
them
in
the
ground
made
what
he
called
he
wove
the
ends
loosely
together
on
top
and
over
this
oval
cover
he
threw
the
saddle
blankets
there
was
just
room
enough
to
crawl
into
this
place
but
it
was
an
escape
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
i
was
soon
asleep
after
i
emerged
the
general
took
my
place
when
he
had
taken
his
nap
the
dogs
crept
in
so
a
very
grateful
family
thanked
the
guide
for
teaching
us
that
new
device
the
bends
in
the
missouri
river
are
sometimes
so
long
that
the
steamer
with
supplies
would
have
to
make
a
journey
of
sixty
miles
while
we
had
perhaps
only
five
to
march
across
the
peninsula
all
the
soldiers
officers
servants
teamsters
and
other
citizen
employés
took
that
time
to
wash
their
clothes
for
we
were
two
days
in
camp
the
creek
on
which
we
halted
was
lined
with
bending
figures
their
arms
moving
vigorously
back
and
forth
as
they
wrung
out
each
article
later
on
the
camp
looked
like
an
animated
laundry
from
every
and
bush
floated
the
apparel
i
had
only
a
small
valise
for
my
summer
s
outfit
but
mary
had
soon
taken
out
our
few
things
and
around
the
was
suspended
the
family
linen
as
soon
as
this
was
dry
she
folded
and
pressed
it
as
best
she
could
and
laid
it
between
the
mattresses
as
a
substitute
for
ironing
all
the
way
up
the
river
the
guide
was
constantly
interviewed
as
to
the
chances
for
fishing
he
held
out
promises
that
were
to
be
realized
upon
reaching
choteau
creek
we
arrived
there
on
one
of
the
and
camp
was
no
sooner
made
and
food
and
water
brought
than
a
great
exodus
took
place
the
general
called
me
to
the
to
see
the
deserted
camp
and
wondered
how
the
soldiers
could
all
have
disappeared
so
quickly
another
problem
was
where
the
came
from
some
had
brought
rods
even
in
the
restricted
space
allotted
them
but
many
cut
them
from
the
bushes
along
the
river
attaching
hooks
and
lines
while
some
bent
pins
and
tied
them
to
strings
the
soldiers
shared
so
generously
with
one
another
that
one
pole
was
loaned
about
while
the
idle
ones
watched
i
never
cared
for
fishing
but
my
husband
begged
me
to
go
with
him
always
and
carried
my
book
and
work
i
sat
under
a
bush
near
him
which
he
covered
with
a
shawl
to
protect
me
from
the
sun
and
there
we
stayed
for
hours
officers
and
men
competed
alike
for
the
best
places
by
the
quiet
pools
the
general
could
hardly
pay
attention
to
his
line
he
was
so
interested
watching
the
men
and
enjoying
their
pleasure
his
keen
sense
of
the
ludicrous
took
in
the
comical
figures
as
far
as
we
could
see
in
cramped
and
uncomfortable
positions
with
earnest
eyes
fixed
steadily
in
one
place
for
hours
they
nearly
fell
into
the
water
with
excitement
if
they
chanced
to
draw
out
a
tiny
fish
the
other
men
came
from
all
along
the
bank
to
observe
if
any
one
was
successful
one
of
the
men
near
us
was
a
member
of
the
band
he
was
a
perfect
reproduction
of
the
old
prints
of
izaak
walton
the
fixedness
of
his
gaze
his
whole
soul
in
his
eyes
while
he
was
utterly
unconscious
of
any
one
being
near
was
too
much
for
the
general
s
equanimity
he
put
his
head
under
the
canopy
made
by
my
shawl
not
daring
to
laugh
aloud
for
fear
he
might
be
heard
by
the
man
and
said
it
was
more
fun
to
see
that
soldier
fish
than
to
hear
him
play
on
the
violin
no
wonder
the
men
enjoyed
the
sport
for
even
these
little
fairly
gritty
from
the
muddy
water
in
which
they
lived
were
a
great
addition
to
their
pork
and
fare
for
once
the
sun
overcame
me
and
i
knew
the
ignominy
of
being
compelled
to
own
that
i
was
dizzy
and
faint
i
had
not
been
long
in
military
life
before
i
was
as
much
ashamed
of
being
ill
as
if
i
had
been
a
real
soldier
the
troops
pride
themselves
on
being
invulnerable
to
bodily
ailments
i
was
obliged
to
submit
to
being
helped
back
to
camp
and
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
watched
the
return
of
the
fishers
who
were
as
proud
of
the
strings
of
ugly
little
things
they
carried
as
if
they
had
been
pickerel
or
bass
then
the
blue
flame
and
soft
smoke
began
to
ascend
from
the
evening
fires
and
the
odor
from
the
frying
supper
rose
on
the
air
in
my
indolent
weak
condition
i
never
knew
how
i
was
able
to
perform
such
agile
pirouettes
as
i
did
but
hearing
a
peculiar
sound
i
looked
down
and
saw
a
huge
rattlesnake
gliding
towards
me
i
had
long
ago
learned
to
suppress
shrieks
but
i
forgot
all
such
then
how
i
wished
myself
the
indian
baby
we
had
seen
the
day
before
the
veritable
baby
in
the
for
it
was
tied
by
buckskin
thongs
to
a
limb
there
i
thought
i
could
rest
in
peace
the
snake
was
soon
despatched
the
men
had
left
camp
so
hurriedly
in
the
morning
that
the
usual
beating
of
the
ground
was
omitted
and
so
i
had
this
unwelcome
visitor
when
we
camped
near
a
village
the
indians
soon
appeared
groups
of
half
a
dozen
on
ponies
with
children
running
after
would
come
the
ponies
were
most
of
them
dull
and
it
was
no
wonder
for
i
have
seen
four
persons
on
one
pony
an
indian
and
three
boys
no
horse
could
keep
its
shape
loaded
down
as
those
of
the
indians
usually
are
with
game
and
property
these
visitors
grew
to
be
great
trials
for
they
were
inveterate
beggars
one
day
an
old
indian
called
came
riding
in
elaborately
decorated
and
on
a
shapely
pony
he
demanded
to
see
the
chief
the
general
appeared
assisted
him
to
dismount
and
seated
him
in
my
the
savage
leaned
back
in
a
grand
sort
of
manner
and
calmly
surveyed
us
all
i
was
soon
in
agonies
of
anxiety
for
colonel
tom
and
the
young
officers
lounging
near
entered
the
tent
they
bowed
low
took
the
hand
of
the
old
fellow
with
profound
deference
and
smiling
benignly
addressed
him
in
just
as
suave
a
voice
as
if
their
words
had
been
genuine
flattery
they
said
you
confounded
old
galoot
why
are
you
here
begging
and
thieving
when
your
wretched
old
hands
are
hardly
dry
from
some
murder
and
your
miserable
mouth
still
red
from
eating
the
heart
of
your
enemy
each
one
saluted
him
and
each
vied
with
the
other
in
pouring
forth
a
tirade
of
forcible
expletives
to
which
he
bowed
in
acknowledgment
and
shook
hands
my
terror
was
that
he
might
understand
for
we
often
found
these
people
as
cunning
as
foxes
sitting
stolid
and
stupid
pretending
not
to
know
a
word
while
they
understood
the
gist
of
much
that
was
said
the
officers
gave
this
chief
tobacco
perique
i
think
it
is
called
and
so
strong
that
though
i
was
accustomed
to
all
kinds
i
rather
avoided
the
odor
of
it
we
had
no
whiskey
but
if
we
had
kept
it
the
general
obeyed
the
law
of
the
reservation
too
strictly
to
allow
it
to
be
given
away
he
was
called
to
the
a
few
moments
and
in
a
trice
one
of
the
others
had
emptied
the
alcohol
from
the
and
offered
the
cup
to
the
distinguished
guest
putting
the
great
square
of
perique
into
his
mouth
with
a
biscuit
beside
he
washed
it
all
down
with
gulps
of
the
burning
fluid
his
eyes
heretofore
dull
sparkled
at
the
sight
of
the
the
officers
said
how
and
he
replied
this
did
not
surprise
me
for
that
one
word
is
the
indian
toast
and
all
tribes
know
it
but
my
breath
almost
went
out
of
my
body
when
they
asked
him
if
he
would
have
more
and
he
replied
you
i
was
sure
then
that
he
had
understood
all
the
railing
speeches
and
that
he
would
plan
a
revenge
loud
cries
of
laughter
greeted
his
reply
but
matching
their
cunning
against
his
they
eventually
found
that
he
knew
no
more
english
he
had
learned
these
words
without
understanding
their
meaning
at
the
trader
s
store
on
the
reservation
he
waited
around
in
the
tent
hoping
for
more
alcohol
until
i
was
weary
of
the
sight
of
him
but
i
was
too
much
afraid
of
him
limp
as
he
then
was
to
look
bored
finally
he
was
lifted
out
a
tumbled
up
disorganized
heap
of
drooping
feathers
trailing
blanket
and
demoralized
legs
when
once
however
one
drunken
old
foot
was
lifted
over
the
pony
for
him
he
swung
himself
into
the
saddle
and
though
swaying
uncertainly
he
managed
to
ride
away
during
the
last
days
of
our
march
we
came
upon
another
premonitory
warning
from
the
indians
a
pole
was
found
stuck
in
the
trail
before
us
with
a
red
flag
to
which
were
fastened
locks
of
hair
it
was
a
challenge
and
when
interpreted
meant
that
if
we
persisted
in
advancing
the
hostiles
were
ready
to
meet
the
soldiers
and
fight
them
the
officers
paid
little
attention
to
this
but
my
heart
was
like
lead
for
days
afterwards
we
encamped
that
night
near
what
the
indians
call
medicine
rock
my
husband
and
i
walked
out
to
see
it
it
was
a
large
stone
showing
on
the
flat
surface
the
impress
of
hands
and
feet
made
ages
ago
before
the
clay
was
petrified
the
indians
had
tied
bags
of
their
herb
medicine
on
poles
about
the
rock
believing
that
virtue
would
enter
into
articles
left
in
the
vicinity

spirit
tin
cans
spoons
and
forks
that
they
had
bought
at
the
agency
on
account
of
the
brightness
of
the
metal
were
left
there
as
offerings
to
an
unseen
god
everything
pertaining
to
the
indians
was
new
and
interesting
to
me
while
we
were
in
kansas
the
tribes
were
at
war
and
we
had
not
the
opportunity
to
see
their
daily
life
as
we
did
while
passing
through
the
sioux
reservations
on
the
march
i
regretted
each
day
that
brought
us
nearer
to
the
conclusion
of
our
journey
for
though
i
had
been
frightened
by
indians
and
though
we
had
encountered
cold
storms
and
rough
life

pleasures
of
the
trip
the
discomforts
chapter
viii
separation
and
reunion
the
day
at
last
came
for
our
march
of
five
hundred
miles
to
terminate
a
rickety
old
ferryboat
that
took
us
over
the
river
made
a
halt
near
fort
rice
and
there
we
established
ourselves
strange
to
say
the
river
was
no
narrower
there
than
it
was
so
many
hundred
miles
below
where
we
started
muddy
and
full
of
as
it
was
we
began
bravely
to
drink
the
water
when
the
glass
had
been
filled
long
enough
for
the
sediment
partially
to
settle
and
to
take
our
bath
in
what
at
first
seemed
liquid
mud
we
learned
after
a
time
to
settle
the
water
with
alum
and
we
finally
became
accustomed
to
the
taste
the
commandant
at
fort
rice
was
most
hospitable
and
his
wife
charming
the
quarters
were
very
ordinary
frame
buildings
with
no
modern
improvements
they
were
painted
a
funereal
tint
but
one
warranted
to
last
the
interior
showed
the
presence
of
a
tasteful
woman
she
met
us
as
cheerfully
as
if
she
were
in
the
luxurious
home
from
which
we
knew
she
had
gone
as
a
girl
to
follow
a
soldier
s
life
contrast
often
helps
us
to
endure
and
dakota
was
not
so
bad
as
their
last
station
in
arizona
the
dinner
was
excellent
and
our
entertainers
were
the
happy
possessors
of
a
good
cook
rarely
do
army
people
have
two
good
servants
at
the
same
time
on
the
frontier
our
host
and
hostess
made
no
apologies
but
quietly
waited
on
the
table
themselves
and
a
merry
time
we
had
over
the
blunders
of
the
head
of
the
house
who
was
a
distinguished
general
in
his
endeavors
to
find
necessary
dishes
in
the
china
closet
a
steamer
that
arrived
a
day
or
two
after
we
had
reached
fort
rice
brought
the
regimental
property
consisting
of
everything
that
was
not
used
on
the
march
our
household
effects
and
trunks
were
delivered
to
us
in
a
very
sorry
condition
they
had
been
carelessly
stored
on
the
wharf
at
yankton
near
the
government
warehouse
without
any
covering
during
all
the
storms
that
drenched
us
coming
up
the
river
almost
everything
was
mildewed
and
ruined
we
tried
to
dry
our
clothing
in
the
sun
many
a
little
bit
of
silken
finery
that
we
had
cherished
since
our
marriage
days
feeling
sure
that
we
should
never
attain
to
such
grandeur
again
was
suspended
from
the
stained
and
dull
our
sister
s
husband
helped
her
to
unpack
her
clothes
and
his
own
soaked
uniform
he
was
dignified
and
reserved
by
nature
but
on
that
occasion
the
barriers
were
broken
i
heard
him
ask
margaret
to
excuse
him
while
he
went
outside
the
tent
to
make
some
remarks
to
himself
that
he
felt
the
occasion
demanded
there
were
furious
people
on
all
sides
and
savage
speeches
about
the
thoughtlessness
of
those
who
had
left
our
property
exposed
to
snow
and
rain
when
we
were
no
longer
there
to
care
for
it
i
endured
everything
until
my
pretty
was
taken
out
crushed
and
spotted
with
mildew
my
husband
had
great
control
over
himself
in
the
small
annoyances
of
life
and
was
able
to
repeat
again
the
proverb
he
had
adopted
in
his
boyhood
never
cry
for
spilled
how
he
could
submit
so
quietly
when
he
took
out
his
prized
books
and
the
few
pictures
i
knew
that
he
valued
was
a
mystery
all
thought
began
now
to
centre
on
the
coming
events
of
the
summer
it
was
decided
that
the
regiment
was
to
go
out
to
guard
the
engineers
of
the
northern
pacific
railroad
while
they
surveyed
the
route
from
bismarck
to
the
yellowstone
river
the
ladies
necessarily
were
to
be
left
behind
now
began
the
summer
of
my
discontent
i
longed
to
remain
in
dakota
for
i
knew
it
would
take
much
longer
for
our
letters
to
reach
us
if
we
went
east
besides
it
was
far
more
comforting
to
stay
at
a
military
post
where
every
one
was
interested
in
the
expedition
and
talked
about
it
as
the
chief
topic
of
concern
i
remembered
when
i
had
gone
east
before
during
a
summer
when
our
regiment
was
fighting
indians
and
my
idea
was
that
the
whole
country
would
be
almost
as
absorbed
as
we
were
how
shocked
i
was
to
be
asked
when
i
spoke
of
the
regiment
ah
is
there
a
campaign
and
for
what
purpose
has
it
gone
out
i
was
willing
to
live
in
a
tent
alone
at
the
post
but
there
were
not
even
tents
to
be
had
then
we
all
looked
with
envious
eyes
at
the
quarters
at
fort
rice
the
post
was
small
and
there
were
no
vacant
rooms
except
in
the
bachelor
quarters
these
are
so
called
when
the
unmarried
men
take
rooms
in
the
same
house
and
mess
together
no
opportunity
was
given
us
to
wheedle
them
into
offering
us
a
place
our
officers
hinted
to
them
but
they
seemed
to
be
completely
intimidated
regarding
women
they
received
an
honest
and
emphatic
no
when
they
asked
if
the
ladies
of
the
cavalry
quarrelled
even
then
these
wary
men
said
they
did
not
dare
to
offer
to
take
in
any
they
added
that
there
were
but
three
in
the
post
and
no
two
of
them
spoke
to
each
other
they
thought
if
we
were
asked
to
remain
it
might
be
the
history
of
the
kilkenny
cats
repeated
and
they
were
obdurate
there
was
nothing
left
for
us
then
but
to
go
home
it
was
a
sore
disappointment
we
were
put
on
the
steamer
that
was
to
take
us
to
bismarck
a
little
group
i
hated
dakota
the
ugly
river
and
even
my
native
land
we
were
nearly
devoured
with
mosquitoes
at
once
only
the
strongest
ammonia
on
our
faces
and
hands
served
to
alleviate
the
torment
the
journey
was
wretchedness
itself
i
had
thrown
myself
on
the
berth
in
one
of
the
little
suffocating
exhausted
with
weeping
and
too
utterly
overcome
with
the
anguish
of
parting
to
know
much
of
the
surroundings
i
was
roused
by
the
gentle
hand
of
a
woman
who
had
forgotten
her
own
troubles
to
come
to
me
ah
even
now
when
the
tears
rain
down
my
face
at
the
remembrance
of
those
agonizing
which
were
like
death
each
time
and
which
grew
harder
with
each
separation
i
think
of
the
sympathy
shown
me
the
sweet
tender
eyes
of
the
wives
of
officers
come
to
me
now
and
i
feel
the
soft
touch
of
their
hands
as
they
came
to
comfort
me
even
when
their
own
hearts
were
wrung
grief
is
so
selfish
i
wonder
now
that
they
could
have
been
such
ministering
angels
at
last
the
slow
wearisome
journey
was
over
and
we
went
into
the
little
town
of
bismarck
to
take
the
cars
the
department
commander
returning
to
his
had
offered
to
take
charge
of
us
to
paul
and
was
kind
enough
to
share
with
us
the
car
of
the
president
of
the
northern
pacific
railroad
which
had
been
placed
at
his
disposal
there
were
seven
of
us
and
his
own
personal
staff
another
five
hundred
miles
were
before
us
but
in
such
luxury
it
hardly
seemed
that
my
sister
and
i
were
the
same
two
who
had
been
roughing
it
on
the
march
a
few
days
before
the
journey
was
very
quiet
and
over
an
uninteresting
country
but
we
ladies
had
something
to
occupy
our
time
as
we
began
to
prepare
some
of
our
meals
for
the
untidy
on
the
road
were
almost
unendurable
the
staff
of
the
commanding
general
went
out
at
the
stations
and
foraged
for
what
food
they
could
find
to
add
to
our
bill
of
fare
at
paul
we
bade
them
all
and
soon
found
ourselves
welcomed
by
dear
father
and
mother
custer
at
monroe
their
hearts
were
ever
with
the
absent
ones
for
several
slow
irksome
months
i
did
little
else
than
wait
for
the
tardy
mails
and
count
each
day
that
passed
a
gain
i
had
very
interesting
letters
from
my
husband
sometimes
thirty
and
forty
pages
in
length
he
wrote
of
his
delight
at
having
again
his
whole
regiment
with
him
his
interest
in
the
country
his
hunting
exploits
and
the
renewal
of
his
friendship
with
general
rosser
the
cavalry
were
sent
out
to
guard
the
engineers
of
the
northern
pacific
while
they
surveyed
the
route
to
the
yellowstone
this
party
of
citizens
joined
the
command
a
few
days
out
from
fort
rice
the
general
wrote
me
that
he
was
lying
on
the
in
his
tent
resting
after
the
march
when
he
heard
a
voice
outside
asking
the
sentinel
which
was
general
custer
s
tent
the
general
called
out
halloo
old
fellow
i
haven
t
heard
that
voice
in
thirteen
years
but
i
know
it
come
in
and
welcome
general
rosser
walked
in
and
such
a
reunion
as
they
had
these
two
had
been
classmates
and
warm
friends
at
west
point
and
parted
with
sorrow
when
general
rosser
went
into
the
southern
army
afterwards
they
had
fought
each
other
in
the
shenandoah
valley
time
and
time
again
both
of
them
lay
on
the
robe
for
hours
talking
over
the
campaigns
in
virginia
in
the
varying
fortunes
of
war
sometimes
one
had
got
possession
of
the
belonging
to
the
other
i
knew
of
several
occasions
when
they
had
captured
each
other
s
wagons
with
the
private
luggage
if
one
drove
the
other
back
in
retreat
before
he
went
into
camp
he
wrote
a
note
addressing
the
other
as
dear
friend
and
saying
you
may
have
made
me
take
a
few
steps
this
way
but
i
ll
be
even
with
you
please
accept
my
and
this
little
these
notes
and
presents
were
left
at
the
house
of
some
southern
woman
as
they
retreated
out
of
the
village
once
general
custer
took
all
of
his
friend
s
luggage
and
found
in
it
a
new
uniform
coat
of
confederate
gray
he
wrote
a
humorous
letter
that
night
thanking
general
rosser
for
setting
him
up
in
so
many
new
things
but
audaciously
asking
if
he
would
direct
his
tailor
to
make
the
of
his
next
uniform
a
little
shorter
as
there
was
a
difference
in
the
height
of
the
two
men
general
custer
captured
his
herd
of
cattle
at
one
time
but
he
was
so
hotly
pursued
by
general
rosser
that
he
had
to
dismount
cut
a
whip
and
drive
them
himself
until
they
were
secured
to
return
to
the
yellowstone
expedition
the
hour
for
starting
never
varied
more
than
a
few
moments
during
the
summer
and
it
was
so
early
the
civilians
connected
with
the
engineering
party
could
not
become
reconciled
to
it
in
the
afternoon
my
husband
sometimes
walked
out
on
the
outskirts
of
camp
and
threw
himself
down
in
the
grass
to
rest
with
his
dogs
beside
him
it
was
a
source
of
amusement
to
him
if
he
accidentally
overheard
the
grumbling
his
campaigning
dress
was
so
like
that
of
an
enlisted
man
and
his
insignia
of
rank
so
unnoticeable
that
the
tongues
ran
on
indifferent
to
his
presence
sometimes
in
their
growling
the
civilians
accused
him
of
having
something
on
his
conscience
and
declared
that
not
being
able
to
sleep
himself
he
woke
every
one
else
to
an
unearthly
reveille
at
this
he
choked
with
laughter
and
to
their
dismay
they
discovered
who
he
was
i
remember
his
telling
me
of
another
occasion
when
he
unavoidably
heard
a
soldier
exclaim
there
goes
taps
and
before
we
get
a
mouthful
to
eat
reveille
will
sound
and
old
curley
will
hike
us
out
for
the
the
soldier
was
slightly
discomfited
to
find
the
subject
of
his
remarks
was
within
hearing
the
enlisted
men
were
constantly
finding
new
names
for
the
general
which
i
would
never
have
known
thereby
losing
some
amusement
if
mary
had
not
occasionally
told
me
of
them
a
favorite
was
jack
the
letters
on
his
valise
having
served
as
a
suggestion
when
the
expedition
returned
from
the
yellowstone
a
despatch
came
to
me
in
michigan
saying
the
regiment
had
reached
fort
lincoln
in
safety
another
soon
followed
informing
me
that
my
husband
was
on
his
way
home
the
relief
from
constant
anxiety
and
suspense
together
with
all
the
excitement
into
which
i
was
thrown
made
me
almost
unfit
to
make
preparation
to
meet
him
there
was
to
be
an
army
reunion
in
the
city
nearest
us
and
in
my
impatience
i
took
the
first
train
thinking
to
reach
there
in
advance
of
general
custer
as
i
walked
along
the
street
looking
into
i
felt
rather
than
saw
a
sudden
rush
from
a
door
and
i
was
taken
off
my
feet
and
set
dancing
in
air
before
i
could
resent
what
i
thought
was
an
indignity
i
discovered
that
it
was
my
husband
who
seemed
utterly
regardless
of
the
he
was
sunburnt
and
mottled
for
the
flesh
was
quite
fair
where
he
had
cut
his
beard
the
growth
of
the
summer
he
told
me
the
officers
with
whom
he
had
travelled
in
the
pullman
car
had
teased
him
and
declared
that
no
man
would
shave
in
a
car
going
at
forty
miles
an
hour
except
to
prepare
to
meet
his
sweetheart
i
was
deeply
grateful
though
for
i
knew
the
fiery
tint
of
the
beard
and
infinitely
preferred
the
variegated
flesh
tints
of
his
sunburnt
face
chapter
ix
our
new
home
at
fort
lincoln
in
a
few
days
we
were
ready
to
return
to
dakota
and
very
glad
to
go
except
for
leaving
the
old
parents
the
hardest
trial
of
my
husband
s
life
was
parting
with
his
mother
such
partings
were
the
only
occasions
when
i
ever
saw
him
lose
entire
control
of
himself
and
i
always
looked
forward
to
the
hour
of
their
separation
with
dread
for
hours
before
we
started
i
have
seen
him
follow
his
mother
about
whispering
some
comforting
word
to
her
or
opening
the
closed
door
of
her
own
room
where
womanlike
she
fought
out
her
grief
alone
sit
beside
her
as
long
as
he
could
endure
it
she
had
been
an
invalid
for
so
many
years
that
each
parting
seemed
to
her
the
final
one
her
groans
and
sobs
were
she
clung
to
him
every
step
when
he
started
to
go
and
exhausted
at
last
was
led
back
half
fainting
to
her
lounge
the
general
would
rush
out
of
the
house
sobbing
like
a
child
and
then
throw
himself
into
the
carriage
beside
me
completely
unnerved
i
could
only
give
silent
comfort
my
heart
bled
for
him
and
in
the
long
silence
that
followed
as
we
journeyed
on
i
knew
that
his
thoughts
were
with
his
mother
at
our
first
stop
he
was
out
of
the
cars
in
an
instant
buying
fruit
to
send
back
to
her
before
we
were
even
unpacked
in
the
hotel
where
we
made
our
first
stay
of
any
length
he
had
dashed
off
a
letter
i
have
since
seen
those
missives
no
matter
how
hurriedly
he
wrote
they
were
proofs
of
the
tenderest
most
filial
love
and
full
of
the
prophecies
he
never
failed
to
make
of
the
reunion
that
he
felt
would
soon
come
after
long
debates
with
her
parents
we
had
captured
a
young
lady
who
was
to
return
with
us
she
was
a
joy
forever
and
submitted
without
a
word
to
the
rough
part
of
our
journey
after
we
left
paul
the
usual
struggle
for
decent
food
began
some
of
the
officers
returning
from
leave
of
absence
had
joined
us
and
we
made
as
merry
over
our
hardships
as
we
could
when
we
entered
the
one
young
member
of
our
party
whom
we
called
the
butter
fiend
was
made
the
experimenter
if
he
found
the
butter
too
rancid
to
eat
undisguised
he
gave
us
a
hint
by
saying
under
his
breath
this
is
a
that
meant
that
we
must
put
a
layer
of
bread
on
top
of
the
butter
to
smother
the
taste
the
general
was
so
sensitive
when
living
in
civilization
that
the
heartiest
appetite
would
desert
him
if
an
allusion
to
anything
unpleasant
or
a
reference
to
suffering
was
made
at
the
table
but
he
never
seemed
to
be
conscious
of
surroundings
when
roughing
of
course
i
had
learned
to
harden
myself
to
almost
anything
by
this
time
but
i
can
see
the
eyes
of
our
girl
friend
when
she
saw
us
eat
all
around
any
foreign
ingredients
we
found
in
our
food
she
nearly
starved
on
a
diet
consisting
of
the
interior
of
potatoes
and
the
inside
of
soggy
rolls
one
of
the
on
the
road
was
kept
in
a
narrow
little
house
built
on
a
flat
car
two
men
presided
one
cooking
and
the
other
waiting
on
the
table
we
were
laboriously
spearing
our
food
with
two
tined
forks
and
sipping
the
muddy
coffee
with
a
pewter
spoon
when
i
heard
with
surprise
the
general
asking
for
a
napkin
it
seemed
as
foreign
to
the
place
as
a
the
waiter
knew
him
however
and
liked
him
too
well
to
refuse
him
anything
so
he
said
i
have
nothing
but
a
towel
just
the
thing
just
the
thing
repeated
my
husband
in
his
quick
jolly
way
so
the
man
tied
a
long
crash
towel
under
his
chin
and
the
general
ate
on
too
indifferent
to
appearances
to
care
because
the
tableful
of
travellers
smiled
when
we
finally
reached
the
termination
of
the
road
at
bismarck
another
train
was
about
starting
back
to
paul
the
street
was
full
of
people
wildly
expostulating
and
talking
loudly
and
fiercely
it
appeared
that
this
was
the
last
train
of
the
season
as
the
cars
were
not
to
run
during
the
winter
the
passengers
were
mostly
bismarck
citizens
whose
lawless
life
as
gamblers
and
murderers
had
so
outraged
the
sentiments
of
the
few
residents
that
they
had
forced
them
to
depart
we
could
see
these
outlaws
crowding
at
the
door
hanging
out
of
the
windows
swearing
and
menacing
and
finally
firing
on
the
retreating
crowd
as
the
cars
passed
out
of
town
i
was
inclined
to
remain
a
fixture
in
our
car
to
step
down
into
such
a
was
too
much
for
my
courage
the
general
made
allowance
for
my
fears
and
we
were
quietly
slipped
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
depot
hurried
into
the
ambulance
and
driven
to
the
river
the
ice
was
already
thick
enough
to
bear
our
weight
part
way
over
then
came
a
swift
rushing
torrent
of
water
which
had
to
be
crossed
in
a
small
boat
some
of
the
soldiers
rowed
while
one
kept
the
huge
cakes
of
floating
ice
from
our
frail
boat
with
a
long
pole
as
i
stepped
into
the
little
craft
i
dropped
upon
the
bottom
and
hid
my
eyes
and
no
amount
of
reference
to
dangers
i
had
encountered
before
induced
me
to
look
up
the
current
of
the
missouri
is
so
swift
it
is
something
dreadful
to
encounter
we
were
lifted
out
upon
the
ice
again
and
walked
to
the
bank
once
more
on
shore
i
said
to
myself
here
will
i
live
and
die
and
never
go
on
that
river
again
our
brother
colonel
tom
met
us
and
drove
us
to
our
new
home
in
the
dim
light
i
could
see
the
great
post
of
fort
lincoln
where
only
a
few
months
before
we
had
left
a
barren
plain
our
quarters
were
lighted
and
as
we
approached
the
regimental
band
played
home
sweet
home
followed
by
the
general
s
favorite
the
general
had
completely
settled
the
house
before
he
left
for
the
east
but
he
had
kept
this
fact
secret
as
a
surprise
our
friends
had
lighted
it
all
and
built
fires
in
the
fireplaces
the
garrison
had
gathered
to
welcome
us
and
mary
had
a
grand
supper
ready
how
we
chattered
and
gloried
over
the
regiment
having
a
home
at
last
it
seemed
too
good
to
believe
that
the
cavalry
had
a
post
of
its
own
with
room
for
the
half
of
the
regiment
assigned
to
duty
there
in
other
garrisons
when
we
had
come
in
late
in
the
fall
from
campaigns
the
officers
in
order
to
get
places
for
themselves
had
been
obliged
to
turn
some
one
else
out
there
is
a
disagreeable
though
probably
necessary
law
in
the
army
regulations
which
directs
officers
to
take
their
quarters
according
to
rank
fort
lincoln
was
built
with
quarters
for
six
companies
the
barracks
for
the
soldiers
were
on
the
side
of
the
nearest
the
river
while
seven
detached
houses
for
officers
faced
the
river
opposite
on
the
left
of
the
was
the
long
granary
and
the
little
military
prison
called
the
opposite
completing
the
square
were
the
quartermaster
and
commissary
storehouses
for
supplies
and
the
adjutant
s
office
outside
the
garrison
proper
near
the
river
were
the
stables
for
six
hundred
horses
still
farther
beyond
were
the
quarters
for
the
laundresses
easily
traced
by
the
swinging
in
front
and
dubbed
for
this
reason
suds
some
distance
on
from
there
were
the
of
the
indian
scouts
and
their
families
while
on
the
same
side
also
was
the
level
plain
used
for
parades
and
drill
on
the
left
of
the
post
was
the
sutler
s
store
with
a
attached
soon
after
the
general
arrived
he
permitted
a
citizen
to
put
up
a
and
afterwards
another
built
a
little
cabin
of
with
canvas
roof
for
a
photographer
s
establishment
the
post
was
located
in
a
valley
while
just
back
of
us
stretched
a
long
chain
of
bluffs
on
the
summit
of
a
hill
nearly
a
mile
to
the
left
was
a
small
infantry
garrison
which
had
been
established
some
time
and
now
belonged
to
our
post
when
we
went
to
return
the
visits
of
the
infantry
ladies
the
mules
dragged
the
ambulance
up
the
steep
hill
with
difficulty
we
found
living
in
this
bleak
place
in
small
shabbily
built
quarters
such
as
a
would
consider
hardly
good
enough
for
his
family
delicate
women
and
children
who
as
usual
made
no
complaint
about
their
life
afterwards
we
were
much
indebted
to
one
of
the
ladies
who
determined
to
conquer
fate
varied
our
lives
and
gave
us
something
to
look
forward
to
by
organizing
a
that
met
every
week
she
had
sent
to
the
east
before
the
trains
ceased
running
for
the
new
books
this
little
post
had
been
built
before
the
railroad
was
completed
and
the
houses
were
put
together
with
as
few
materials
as
possible
there
was
no
plastering
but
the
ceilings
and
partitions
were
of
thick
paper
made
for
the
purpose
when
narrow
mouldings
of
wood
were
tacked
over
the
joined
places
and
all
of
it
painted
the
effect
was
very
pretty
when
it
was
torn
and
ragged
it
looked
enough
in
one
set
of
quarters
there
chanced
to
be
so
many
children
and
so
little
room
that
the
parents
had
invented
a
bed
where
the
little
ones
could
be
all
stowed
at
night
while
we
were
calling
there
one
day
i
sat
talking
with
the
cheerful
little
mother
and
wondering
how
she
could
be
so
bright
everything
in
garrison
life
was
of
course
new
to
my
girl
friend
and
i
discovered
she
was
trying
to
smother
a
laugh
she
commanded
a
view
of
the
inner
door
one
of
the
children
who
had
been
beating
the
wall
and
crying
to
enter
had
finally
made
preliminary
preparations
she
had
thrust
through
a
hole
in
the
paper
partition
each
article
of
her
little
wardrobe
even
to
her
shoes
and
was
putting
the
first
rosy
foot
through
after
them
when
the
mother
discovered
this
she
laughed
heartily
and
gave
us
thus
an
opportunity
to
join
her
our
own
post
was
somewhat
sheltered
by
the
bluffs
behind
but
though
our
quarters
were
plastered
the
unseasoned
lumber
warped
and
it
was
a
struggle
to
keep
warm
the
wood
with
which
we
were
provided
was
far
from
dry
and
much
of
it
of
that
kind
that
burns
quickly
but
sends
out
little
heat
it
seemed
to
require
the
entire
time
of
one
man
to
keep
up
the
fires
it
was
thus
a
blessed
thing
for
the
poor
fellow
whose
duty
it
was
for
he
had
never
been
able
to
remain
long
with
his
company
at
a
time
he
had
an
uncontrollable
habit
of
drinking
most
of
the
time
he
belonged
to
the
band
of
prisoners
who
are
taken
out
of
the
every
day
under
a
sentinel
to
police
the
garrison
and
cut
the
wood
mary
gave
them
the
coffee
and
whatever
else
was
left
from
the
table
every
day
this
seemingly
worthless
fellow
told
mary
that
he
believed
he
could
keep
straight
if
custer
would
get
the
general
to
remit
his
sentence
and
let
him
come
to
us
to
keep
the
fires
so
he
came
and
was
occasionally
sober
for
some
time
he
learned
to
go
through
the
house
with
his
arms
full
of
wood
when
he
was
quite
drunk
he
really
had
too
much
heart
to
cause
me
trouble
and
used
to
say
mary
i
am
pretty
full
but
don
t
let
custer
know
it
for
i
told
her
i
would
not
do
so
again
and
i
don
t
like
to
make
her
feel
so
mary
spied
out
the
land
before
him
and
opened
his
doors
after
he
had
tried
her
patience
long
she
finally
lost
her
temper
on
finding
that
he
had
swallowed
all
the
worcestershire
sauce
and
her
bottle
of
she
held
out
the
can
of
kerosene
oil
to
him
and
asked
if
he
would
not
add
that
to
his
dram
and
began
such
a
berating
that
he
hurried
off
to
escape
from
the
violence
of
her
tongue
the
soldiers
asked
the
general
s
permission
to
put
up
a
place
in
which
they
could
have
entertainments
and
he
gave
them
every
assistance
he
could
they
prepared
the
lumber
in
the
that
belonged
to
the
post
the
building
was
an
ungainly
looking
structure
but
large
enough
to
hold
them
all
the
unseasoned
warped
even
while
the
house
was
being
built
but
by
patching
and
lining
with
old
torn
tents
they
managed
to
keep
out
the
storm
the
scenery
was
painted
on
condemned
canvas
stretched
on
a
and
was
lifted
on
and
off
as
the
plays
required
the
footlights
in
front
of
the
rude
stage
were
that
smoked
and
sputtered
inside
the
clumsily
cobbled
casing
of
tin
the
seats
were
narrow
benches
without
backs
the
officers
and
ladies
were
always
invited
to
take
the
front
row
at
every
new
performance
and
after
they
entered
the
house
filled
up
with
soldiers
some
of
the
enlisted
men
played
very
well
and
used
great
ingenuity
in
getting
up
their
costumes
the
general
accepted
every
invitation
and
enjoyed
it
all
greatly
the
and
negro
character
songs
between
the
acts
were
excellent
indeed
we
sometimes
had
professionals
who
having
been
stranded
in
the
states
had
enlisted
a
regiment
is
recruited
from
all
classes
and
conditions
of
men
occasionally
accident
revealed
the
secret
that
there
were
fugitives
from
justice
in
the
ranks
if
they
changed
their
names
they
found
no
place
where
they
were
so
hidden
from
every
one
they
ever
knew
as
in
a
regiment
that
is
always
on
duty
in
the
territories
it
came
to
pass
sometimes
that
a
man
of
title
who
had
left
his
country
for
his
country
s
good
wore
the
government
blue
as
a
disguise
and
served
as
a
trooper
for
want
of
anything
better
to
do
among
the
men
who
sent
word
they
would
be
glad
to
help
me
about
the
house
when
we
were
settling
either
as
a
carpenter
a
saddler
to
sew
carpets
or
a
blacksmith
to
put
up
stoves
there
were
several
with
histories
though
they
were
strictly
military
with
the
general
observing
the
rule
of
never
speaking
unless
spoken
to
they
sought
the
first
opportunity
to
tell
me
their
troubles
these
were
invariably
domestic
difficulties
until
i
began
to
think
our
regiment
was
a
city
of
refuge
for
outraged
husbands
it
would
eventually
be
found
out
that
these
men
had
run
away
and
enlisted
under
assumed
names
when
driven
desperate
by
the
scoldings
of
a
turbulent
wife
time
and
the
loneliness
of
a
soldier
s
life
would
soften
their
woes
and
they
began
at
last
to
sigh
even
for
the
voice
of
the
deserted
woman
the
general
felt
as
badly
as
i
did
when
i
carried
their
stories
to
him
begging
him
to
get
them
discharged
he
had
a
little
fashion
however
of
asking
me
to
remember
that
about
this
as
about
every
other
subject
that
we
ever
discussed
there
were
always
two
sides
to
a
my
sympathy
for
the
soldiers
in
trouble
was
of
little
avail
for
the
law
compelling
them
to
serve
the
five
years
out
was
irrevocable
all
i
could
do
was
to
write
letters
at
their
solicitation
revealing
their
identity
and
asking
for
a
reconciliation
my
husband
s
duties
extended
over
a
wide
range
if
the
laundresses
had
a
serious
difficulty
he
was
asked
to
settle
it
they
had
many
pugilists
among
them
and
the
least
infringement
of
their
rights
provoked
a
battle
in
which
wood
and
other
missiles
filled
the
air
bandaged
and
bruised
they
brought
their
wrongs
to
our
house
where
both
sides
had
a
hearing
the
general
had
occasionally
to
listen
and
arbitrate
between
husband
and
wife
when
the
laundress
and
her
soldier
husband
could
not
agree
i
was
banished
from
the
room
while
he
heard
their
story
and
gave
them
counsel
in
the
same
way
he
listened
to
whatever
complaints
the
soldiers
made
some
of
them
came
into
our
quarters
on
one
occasion
with
a
tin
cup
of
coffee
for
the
general
to
taste
and
determine
whether
he
agreed
with
them
that
it
was
too
poor
to
drink
from
that
time
on
after
every
sunday
morning
inspection
the
general
went
with
all
the
officers
to
visit
the
kitchens
as
well
as
the
barracks
of
each
company
and
every
troop
commander
was
called
upon
to
pass
criticisms
on
the
cleanliness
of
the
quarters
and
the
wholesomeness
of
the
food
chapter
x
incidents
of
life
the
companies
each
gave
a
ball
in
turn
during
the
winter
and
the
preparations
were
begun
long
in
advance
there
was
no
place
to
buy
anything
save
the
sutler
s
store
and
the
shops
in
the
little
town
of
bismarck
but
they
were
well
ransacked
for
materials
for
the
supper
the
bunks
where
the
soldiers
slept
were
removed
from
the
barracks
and
flags
festooned
around
the
room
arms
were
stacked
and
guidons
arranged
in
groups
a
few
pictures
of
distinguished
men
were
wreathed
in
imitation
laurel
leaves
cut
out
of
green
paper
chandeliers
and
side
brackets
carved
out
of
boards
into
fantastic
shapes
were
filled
with
candles
while
at
either
end
of
the
long
room
great
logs
in
the
wide
fireplaces
threw
out
a
cheerful
light
the
ball
opened
headed
by
the
after
this
the
officers
and
their
wives
were
invited
to
form
a
set
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
we
danced
several
times
one
of
the
men
whose
voice
was
clear
and
loud
sang
the
calls
he
was
a
comical
genius
and
improvised
new
ways
of
calling
off
when
the
place
came
in
the
quadrille
to
turn
your
partners
his
voice
rose
above
the
music
in
the
notes
of
the
old
song
oh
swing
those
girls
those
pretty
little
girls
those
girls
you
left
behind
you
this
was
such
an
inspiration
to
the
that
the
swinging
usually
ended
in
our
being
whirled
in
the
air
by
the
privileged
members
of
our
family
the
soldiers
were
a
superb
lot
of
men
physically
the
life
had
developed
them
into
perfect
specimens
of
vigorous
manhood
after
the
company
tailor
had
cut
over
their
uniforms
they
were
often
the
perfection
of
good
fitting
the
older
soldiers
wore
on
the
sleeves
of
their
coats
the
rows
of
braid
that
designate
the
number
of
years
in
the
service
some
had
the
army
badges
of
the
corps
in
which
they
fought
during
the
war
while
an
occasional
foreign
decoration
showed
that
they
had
been
brave
soldiers
in
the
fatherland
we
were
escorted
out
to
the
in
the
in
advance
of
the
enlisted
men
the
general
delighted
the
hearts
of
the
sergeant
and
by
sitting
down
to
a
great
dish
of
it
was
always
with
the
onion
as
rare
out
there
and
more
appreciated
than
pomegranates
are
in
new
york
we
ladies
took
cake
of
course
but
sparingly
for
it
was
also
a
great
luxury
when
we
returned
to
watch
the
dancing
the
general
was
on
nettles
for
fear
we
should
be
wanting
in
tact
and
show
our
amusement
by
laughing
at
the
costumes
of
the
women
there
was
but
a
sprinkling
of
them
several
from
bismarck
and
a
few
white
servants
of
the
officers
each
company
was
allowed
but
three
or
four
laundresses
the
soldier
was
obliged
to
ask
permission
to
marry
and
his
engagement
was
a
weary
waiting
sometimes
in
order
to
get
a
vacancy
for
his
sweetheart
he
had
to
await
the
discharge
of
some
other
soldier
from
the
company
whose
wife
held
the
appointment
of
laundress
these
women
were
at
the
ball
in
full
force
and
each
one
brought
her
baby
when
we
removed
our
wraps
in
the
room
of
the
we
usually
found
his
bed
quite
full
of
infants
sleeping
while
the
laundress
mothers
danced
the
toilets
of
these
women
were
something
marvellous
in
construction
in
low
neck
and
short
sleeves
their
round
red
arms
and
figures
wheeled
around
the
barracks
all
night
long
even
the
tall
mexican
laundress
hereafter
specially
mentioned
would
deck
herself
in
pink
tarletan
and
false
curls
and
notwithstanding
her
height
and
colossal
anatomy
she
had
constant
partners
the
little
dutch
woman
who
loved
her
husband
more
devotedly
after
each
beating
and
did
not
dance
with
any
one
else
was
never
absent
from
the
balls
her
tiny
little
figure
was
suspended
between
heaven
and
earth
while
her
tall
soldier
whirled
her
around
the
long
hall
in
the
endless
german
waltz
some
officer
would
whisper
slyly
in
my
ear
as
she
bowed
and
smiled
in
passing
do
you
see
the
of
old
trooble
agin
she
had
long
before
earned
this
sobriquet
when
coming
to
me
for
help
out
of
her
misfortunes
beginning
each
story
of
woe
with
trooble
wherever
we
were
when
the
orders
were
issued
for
a
campaign
she
soon
appeared
claiming
sympathy
no
one
could
feel
at
such
a
time
more
than
i
the
truth
of
her
preface
for
if
we
were
to
be
left
behind
it
was
indeed
trouble
the
pack
of
hounds
were
an
endless
source
of
delight
to
the
general
we
had
about
forty
the
that
run
by
sight
and
are
on
the
whole
the
fleetest
and
most
enduring
dogs
in
the
world
and
the
that
follow
the
trail
with
their
noses
close
to
the
ground
the
first
rarely
bark
but
the
latter
are
very
noisy
the
general
and
i
used
to
listen
with
amusement
to
their
attempts
to
strike
the
of
the
bugler
when
he
sounded
the
calls
summoning
the
men
to
guard
mount
stables
or
retreat
it
rather
destroyed
the
military
effect
to
see
beside
his
soldierly
figure
a
hound
sitting
down
absorbed
in
imitation
with
lifted
head
and
rolling
eyes
there
issued
from
the
broad
mouth
notes
so
doleful
they
would
have
answered
for
a
the
were
of
the
most
use
in
the
winter
for
the
hunting
was
generally
in
the
underbrush
and
timber
along
the
river
i
never
tired
of
watching
the
start
for
the
hunt
the
general
was
a
figure
that
would
have
fixed
attention
anywhere
he
had
marked
individuality
of
appearance
and
a
certain
unstudied
carelessness
in
the
wearing
of
his
costume
that
gave
a
picturesque
effect
not
the
least
out
of
place
on
the
frontier
he
wore
reaching
to
his
knees
buckskin
breeches
fringed
on
the
sides
a
dark
navy
blue
shirt
with
a
broad
collar
a
red
necktie
whose
ends
floated
over
his
shoulder
exactly
as
they
did
when
he
and
his
entire
division
of
cavalry
had
worn
them
during
the
war
on
the
broad
felt
hat
that
was
almost
a
sombrero
was
fastened
a
slight
mark
of
his
rank
he
was
at
this
time
years
of
age
weighed
one
hundred
and
seventy
pounds
and
was
nearly
six
feet
in
height
his
eyes
were
clear
blue
and
deeply
set
his
hair
short
wavy
and
golden
in
tint
his
mustache
was
long
and
tawny
in
color
his
complexion
was
florid
except
where
his
forehead
was
shaded
by
his
hat
for
the
sun
always
burned
his
skin
ruthlessly
he
was
the
most
agile
active
man
i
ever
knew
and
so
very
strong
and
in
such
perfect
physical
condition
that
he
rarely
knew
even
an
hour
s
indisposition
horse
and
man
seemed
one
when
the
general
vaulted
into
the
saddle
his
body
was
so
lightly
poised
and
so
full
of
swinging
undulating
motion
it
almost
seemed
that
the
wind
moved
him
as
it
blew
over
the
plain
yet
every
nerve
was
alert
and
like
finely
tempered
steel
for
the
muscles
and
sinews
that
seemed
so
pliable
were
equal
to
the
curbing
of
the
most
fiery
animal
i
do
not
think
that
he
sat
his
horse
with
more
grace
than
the
other
officers
for
they
rode
superbly
but
it
was
accounted
by
others
almost
an
impossibility
to
dislodge
the
general
from
the
saddle
no
matter
how
vicious
the
horse
might
prove
he
threw
his
feet
out
of
the
stirrups
the
moment
the
animal
began
to
show
his
inclination
for
war
and
with
his
knees
dug
into
the
sides
of
the
plunging
brute
he
fought
and
always
conquered
with
his
own
horses
he
needed
neither
spur
nor
whip
they
were
such
friends
of
his
and
his
voice
seemed
so
attuned
to
their
natures
they
knew
as
well
by
its
inflections
as
by
the
slight
pressure
of
the
bridle
on
their
necks
what
he
wanted
by
the
merest
inclination
on
the
general
s
part
they
either
sped
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
or
adapted
their
spirited
steps
to
the
slow
movement
of
the
march
it
was
a
delight
to
see
them
together
they
were
so
in
unison
and
when
he
talked
to
them
as
though
they
had
been
human
beings
their
intelligent
eyes
seemed
to
reply
as
an
example
of
his
horsemanship
he
had
a
way
of
escaping
from
the
stagnation
of
the
dull
march
when
it
was
not
dangerous
to
do
so
by
riding
a
short
distance
in
advance
of
the
column
over
a
divide
throwing
himself
on
one
side
of
his
horse
so
as
to
be
entirely
out
of
sight
from
the
other
direction
giving
a
signal
that
the
animal
understood
and
tearing
off
at
the
best
speed
that
could
be
made
the
horse
entered
into
the
frolic
with
all
the
zest
of
his
master
and
after
the
race
the
animal
s
beautiful
distended
nostrils
glowed
as
he
tossed
his
head
and
danced
with
delight
in
hunting
the
general
rode
either
vic
or
dandy
the
dogs
were
so
fond
of
the
latter
they
seemed
to
have
little
talks
with
him
the
general
s
favorite
dog
blücher
would
leap
up
to
him
in
the
saddle
and
jump
fairly
over
the
horse
in
starting
the
spirited
horses
mounted
by
officers
who
sat
them
so
well
the
sound
of
the
horn
used
for
the
purpose
of
calling
the
dogs
their
answering
bay
the
glad
voices
and
to
the
hounds
as
the
party
galloped
down
the
valley
are
impressions
ineffaceable
from
my
memory
they
often
started
a
deer
within
sound
of
the
bugle
at
the
post
in
a
few
hours
their
shouts
outside
would
call
me
to
the
window
and
there
drooping
across
the
back
of
one
of
the
orderlies
horses
would
be
a
magnificent
deer
we
had
a
saddle
of
venison
hanging
on
the
almost
constantly
during
the
winter
the
officers
and
even
the
soldiers
tables
had
this
rarity
to
vary
the
monotony
of
the
inevitable
beef
after
these
hunts
the
dogs
had
often
to
be
cared
for
they
would
be
lame
or
cut
in
the
chase
through
the
tangle
of
vines
and
branches
these
were
so
dense
it
was
a
constant
wonder
to
the
general
how
the
deer
could
press
through
with
its
spreading
antlers
the
english
hounds
unacquainted
with
our
game
used
to
begin
with
a
porcupine
sometimes
it
was
pitiful
though
for
a
moment
at
first
sight
amusing
to
see
their
noses
and
lips
looking
like
animated
there
was
nothing
for
us
to
do
after
such
an
encounter
but
to
begin
surgery
at
once
the
general
would
not
take
time
to
get
off
his
nor
go
near
the
fire
until
he
had
called
the
dog
into
his
room
and
extracted
the
painful
quills
with
the
tweezers
from
his
invaluable
knife
i
sat
on
the
dog
and
held
his
paws
but
quivered
even
when
i
kept
my
head
averted
the
quills
being
barbed
can
not
be
withdrawn
but
must
be
pulled
through
in
the
same
direction
in
which
they
entered
the
gums
lips
and
roof
of
the
mouth
were
full
of
little
wounds
but
the
dogs
were
extremely
sagacious
and
held
very
still
when
the
painful
operation
was
over
they
were
very
grateful
licking
the
general
s
hand
as
he
praised
them
for
their
pluck
sometimes
when
the
weather
was
moderate
and
i
rode
after
the
one
of
them
separated
himself
from
the
pack
and
came
shaking
his
great
velvet
ears
and
wagging
his
cumbrous
tail
beside
my
horse
the
general
would
call
my
attention
to
him
and
tell
me
that
it
was
our
latest
surgical
patient
paying
us
his
bill
in
gratitude
which
is
the
exchequer
of
the
among
the
pack
was
an
old
hound
that
had
occasional
fits
when
he
felt
the
symptoms
of
an
attack
he
left
the
kennel
at
the
rear
of
the
house
came
round
to
the
and
barked
or
scratched
to
get
in
my
husband
knew
at
once
that
the
dog
was
going
to
suffer
and
that
instinct
had
taught
him
to
come
to
us
for
help
rover
would
lie
down
beside
the
general
until
his
hour
of
distress
and
then
solicit
the
sympathy
with
his
mournful
eyes
the
general
rubbed
and
cared
for
him
while
the
dog
writhed
and
foamed
at
the
mouth
he
was
always
greatly
touched
to
see
the
old
hound
when
he
began
to
revive
try
to
lift
the
tip
of
his
tail
in
gratitude
with
the
hunting
was
so
bred
in
the
bone
that
they
sometimes
went
off
by
themselves
and
even
the
puppies
followed
i
have
seen
them
returning
from
such
a
hunt
the
one
who
led
the
pack
holding
proudly
in
his
mouth
a
the
wolves
in
their
desperate
hunger
used
to
come
up
on
the
bluffs
almost
within
a
stone
of
our
quarters
it
was
far
from
pleasant
to
look
out
of
the
window
and
see
them
prowling
about
once
when
the
were
let
out
of
the
kennel
for
exercise
they
flew
like
the
winds
over
the
hills
after
a
coyote
the
soldier
who
took
care
of
them
could
only
follow
on
foot
as
the
crust
on
the
snow
would
not
bear
the
weight
of
a
horse
after
a
long
cold
walk
he
found
the
dogs
standing
over
the
wolf
they
had
killed
when
he
had
dragged
it
back
to
our
he
sent
in
to
ask
if
the
general
would
come
and
see
what
the
dogs
had
done
unaided
and
alone
for
he
was
very
proud
of
them
as
the
family
all
stood
talking
over
the
size
of
the
coyote
and
its
fur
i
said
triumphantly
now
i
shall
have
a
robe
it
was
enough
for
them
and
they
made
no
end
of
sport
about
my
planning
a
robe
out
of
one
small
skin
after
we
had
all
gone
into
the
house
the
soldier
who
was
not
accustomed
to
hear
such
badgering
went
in
to
mary
and
indignantly
exclaimed
be
jabers
and
they
ll
not
tease
her
about
that
long
after
that
during
the
winter
he
walked
frequently
over
the
plain
with
the
dogs
and
when
they
had
started
a
trail
and
run
almost
out
of
sight
he
patiently
followed
until
he
readied
the
spot
where
they
had
brought
down
the
game
even
in
that
bitter
weather
he
brought
in
enough
foxes
swifts
and
coyotes
to
make
me
a
large
robe
when
it
was
made
up
i
triumphantly
placed
myself
on
it
and
reminded
my
family
of
their
teasing
and
the
time
so
lately
past
when
i
had
been
an
object
of
jest
to
them
the
weather
seemed
to
grow
colder
and
colder
as
the
winter
advanced
from
to
below
zero
was
ordinary
weather
the
officers
were
energetic
enough
to
get
up
sleighs
even
with
all
the
difficulties
they
had
to
encounter
there
was
no
lumber
at
the
post
except
unseasoned
the
man
who
could
get
a
for
the
body
of
his
sleigh
was
a
crœsus
the
carpenter
cut
and
sawed
the
edges
into
scallops
and
curves
the
rudest
bobs
were
ironed
by
the
company
blacksmith
and
the
huge
tongue
of
an
army
wagon
was
attached
to
the
frail
the
was
painted
black
and
really
the
color
and
shape
reminded
one
of
a
little
baby
hearse
sister
margaret
and
i
disliked
sleighing
even
under
favorable
circumstances
but
that
made
no
sort
of
difference
we
were
expected
to
go
twice
a
day
and
try
in
turn
each
new
sleigh
my
husband
found
a
sketch
in
some
of
the
illustrated
papers
which
he
thought
such
a
fitting
representation
of
us
that
he
added
some
lines
and
drew
some
applicable
features
to
the
picture
and
wrote
underneath
margaret
and
libbie
a
two
wretched
shivering
beings
wrapped
in
furs
sit
with
their
feet
in
a
tub
of
while
a
servant
rings
a
over
their
heads
when
we
were
thus
taken
out
as
a
sacrifice
we
were
enveloped
in
so
many
wraps
we
had
literally
to
be
carried
and
dropped
into
the
sleigh
and
after
hot
bricks
were
adjusted
to
our
feet
we
assumed
the
martyr
look
that
women
understand
how
to
take
on
when
persuaded
against
their
will
and
off
we
flew
it
made
no
impression
if
we
were
speechless
the
dearth
of
women
made
the
men
far
from
critical
sometimes
we
went
to
the
hart
river
which
empties
into
the
missouri
and
which
we
were
not
afraid
to
drive
over
as
it
was
frozen
solid
and
yet
it
should
be
understood
that
we
preferred
to
go
and
be
frozen
rather
than
stay
at
home
and
be
comfortable
for
we
were
a
band
of
friends
sharing
the
same
isolation
and
each
took
comfort
in
contributing
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
rest
one
sort
of
sleighing
we
really
did
enjoy
one
of
the
officers
got
up
a
long
sleigh
using
the
bed
of
an
army
wagon
for
the
box
he
was
his
own
coachman
and
stood
in
front
driving
an
excellent
we
all
placed
ourselves
in
the
straw
and
robes
and
nothing
of
the
whole
party
was
visible
except
two
rows
of
tip
tilted
noses
peeping
out
from
under
fur
caps
and
gay
mufflers
if
any
one
rashly
left
a
seat
to
play
some
prank
it
was
never
regained
the
space
closed
up
instantly
and
it
was
a
choice
of
standing
for
the
rest
of
the
distance
or
uncomfortably
sitting
on
the
spurs
arctics
or
buffalo
of
the
others
another
of
our
number
tried
driving
tandem
and
as
his
horses
were
very
fleet
and
his
sleigh
very
frail
it
was
a
study
from
first
to
last
how
soon
we
should
gather
up
the
fragments
of
our
scattered
selves
from
the
white
plain
over
which
we
flew
at
eagle
speed
when
the
thermometer
went
down
to
below
zero
the
utmost
vigilance
was
exercised
to
prevent
the
men
from
being
frozen
the
general
took
off
all
the
sentinels
but
two
and
those
were
encased
in
buffalo
overcoats
and
shoes
and
required
to
walk
their
beat
but
fifteen
minutes
at
a
time
there
were
no
wells
or
cisterns
and
the
quartermaster
had
no
means
of
supplying
the
post
with
water
except
with
a
that
required
six
mules
to
haul
it
around
the
garrison
the
hole
in
the
river
through
which
the
water
was
drawn
was
cut
through
five
feet
of
ice
it
was
simply
dreadful
on
those
bitter
days
to
see
the
poor
men
whose
duty
it
was
to
distribute
the
supply
my
husband
used
to
turn
away
with
a
shudder
from
the
window
when
they
came
in
sight
and
beg
me
not
to
talk
of
a
matter
that
he
was
powerless
to
remedy
the
two
barrels
at
the
were
all
that
we
could
have
and
on
some
days
the
men
and
wagon
could
not
go
around
at
all
we
husbanded
every
drop
and
borrowed
from
a
neighbor
if
any
neighbor
was
fortunate
enough
not
to
have
used
all
his
supply
chapter
xi
the
burning
of
our
carrying
the
mail
we
had
hardly
finished
arranging
our
quarters
when
one
freezing
night
i
was
awakened
by
a
roaring
sound
in
a
chimney
that
had
been
defective
from
the
first
women
have
such
a
rooted
habit
of
smelling
smoke
and
sending
men
on
needless
investigating
trips
in
the
dead
of
night
that
i
tried
to
keep
still
for
a
few
moments
the
sound
grew
too
loud
to
be
mistaken
and
i
awakened
my
husband
he
ran
and
found
the
room
above
us
on
fire
he
called
to
me
to
bring
him
some
water
believing
he
could
extinguish
it
himself
while
i
hurried
after
the
water
there
came
such
a
crash
and
explosion
that
my
brain
seemed
to
reel
from
fright
i
had
no
thought
but
that
my
husband
was
killed
nothing
can
describe
the
relief
with
which
i
heard
his
voice
calling
back
to
my
agonized
question
as
to
his
safety
his
escape
was
very
narrow
the
chimney
had
burst
the
whole
side
of
the
room
was
blown
out
and
he
was
covered
with
plaster
and
surrounded
with
fallen
bricks
the
gas
from
the
petroleum
paper
put
on
between
the
plastering
and
the
outer
walls
to
keep
out
the
cold
had
exploded
the
roof
had
ignited
at
once
and
was
blown
off
with
a
noise
like
the
report
of
artillery
the
sentinel
at
the
fired
his
carbine
as
an
alarm
the
general
ran
to
one
of
the
lower
windows
and
with
his
powerful
voice
that
he
could
throw
so
far
called
for
the
guard
then
we
hurried
to
the
room
occupied
by
our
the
plastering
falling
on
her
bed
from
the
burning
roof
was
the
first
hint
she
had
of
the
danger
it
was
unsafe
for
her
to
stop
to
gather
her
clothes
and
wrapping
a
blanket
about
her
we
sent
her
to
our
sister
next
door
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
men
were
swarming
about
the
house
the
general
had
buttoned
his
vest
containing
his
watch
and
purse
over
his
long
and
unconscious
of
his
appearance
gave
just
as
cool
orders
to
the
soldiers
as
if
it
were
at
drill
they
also
were
perfectly
cool
and
worked
like
beavers
to
remove
our
things
for
with
no
engine
and
without
water
it
was
useless
to
try
to
save
the
house
the
general
stood
upon
the
upper
landing
and
forbade
them
to
join
him
as
it
was
perilous
the
floors
being
then
on
fire
he
had
insisted
upon
my
going
out
of
the
house
but
i
was
determined
not
to
do
so
until
he
was
safe
when
i
did
leave
i
ran
in
my
over
the
snow
to
our
sister
s
the
house
burned
very
quickly
fortunately
it
was
a
still
cold
night
and
there
was
no
wind
to
spread
the
flames
except
for
this
the
whole
garrison
must
have
been
burned
when
the
morning
came
we
went
to
inspect
the
heap
of
household
belongings
that
had
been
carried
out
on
the
it
was
a
sorry
collection
of
torn
broken
and
marred
effects
most
of
my
clothes
were
gone
our
poor
looked
down
into
her
trunk
empty
except
for
one
tarlatan
party
gown
i
had
lost
silver
and
linen
and
what
laces
and
finery
i
had
the
only
loss
i
mourned
as
it
was
really
irreparable
was
a
collection
of
newspaper
clippings
regarding
my
husband
that
i
had
saved
during
and
since
the
war
besides
these
i
lost
a
little
wig
that
i
had
worn
at
a
ball
made
from
the
golden
rings
of
curly
hair
cut
from
my
husband
s
head
after
the
war
when
he
had
given
up
wearing
long
locks
the
fire
served
one
purpose
after
all
before
it
occurred
i
had
always
been
a
trial
to
mary
because
i
cared
so
little
for
dress
and
really
owned
so
few
ornaments
when
the
servants
gathered
together
after
that
to
boast
of
the
possessions
of
their
several
mistresses
as
is
customary
with
the
colored
people
who
so
love
display
mary
was
armed
with
an
excuse
for
me
i
used
to
hear
of
her
saying
you
jist
orter
seed
what
miss
libbie
had
afo
the
fire
and
then
she
would
describe
in
detail
elegant
apparel
that
i
had
never
even
thought
of
having
long
afterwards
i
heard
of
the
comments
of
one
of
our
number
who
loved
the
loaves
and
fishes
of
this
life
beyond
everything
in
vain
she
accumulated
and
had
the
proud
satisfaction
of
every
one
in
the
number
of
her
dresses
mary
managed
to
slip
into
her
kitchen
on
some
feigned
errand
and
drawing
upon
her
imagination
related
how
much
richer
miss
libbie
s
possessions
were
before
the
fire
i
had
a
hearty
laugh
by
myself
when
i
heard
that
the
miss
flora
mcflimsey
of
our
circle
worn
out
with
the
boasting
of
the
cook
was
heard
to
exclaim
i
wish
i
might
have
seen
for
myself
all
the
gorgeousness
described
i
am
tired
to
death
of
hearing
about
befo
the
the
general
selected
another
set
of
quarters
next
to
his
brother
s
and
thither
removed
the
remnants
of
our
household
goods
he
begged
me
not
to
go
near
the
house
or
attempt
to
settle
until
i
had
recovered
from
the
fright
of
the
fire
and
of
his
imperilled
life
the
night
before
we
were
all
busy
enough
trying
to
fit
our
things
upon
our
little
friend
her
purse
with
abundance
to
buy
a
new
outfit
was
burned
and
it
would
be
weeks
before
she
could
receive
a
remittance
from
home
by
our
slow
mails
next
day
as
she
sat
among
us
in
borrowed
apparel
several
sizes
too
large
she
had
a
surprise
a
huge
was
handed
in
at
the
door
with
a
note
addressed
to
her
begging
her
to
consider
herself
what
the
garrison
had
long
felt
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
the
basket
contained
everything
that
the
generous
hearts
of
friends
could
suggest
not
content
with
this
another
was
sent
on
the
next
day
with
a
further
supply
of
things
bought
in
the
store
at
bismarck
she
objected
to
the
acceptance
and
tears
rose
in
her
eyes
at
the
thoughtfulness
but
there
were
no
names
signed
to
the
note
so
we
would
not
heed
remonstrances
every
one
came
with
needles
and
thimbles
and
the
scissors
flew
i
was
too
much
absorbed
in
this
scheme
to
ask
many
questions
about
the
new
quarters
when
i
did
inquire
the
general
put
me
off
by
saying
that
in
a
few
days
i
should
begin
to
settle
the
second
evening
after
the
fire
he
sent
for
me
and
asked
if
i
would
come
and
consult
with
him
about
some
arrangement
of
the
furniture
as
he
was
too
busy
to
come
after
me
i
started
at
once
but
mary
ever
thoughtful
of
my
appearance
and
deep
in
the
mystery
that
followed
urged
me
to
put
on
my
other
gown
i
was
unwillingly
put
into
it
and
went
to
the
new
house
to
find
both
sets
of
quarters
lighted
throughout
and
the
band
playing
home
sweet
my
husband
meeting
me
led
me
in
and
to
my
utter
surprise
i
found
the
whole
place
completely
settled
a
door
cut
through
into
colonel
tom
s
quarters
and
the
garrison
assembled
at
the
general
s
invitation
for
the
the
pantry
was
full
of
good
things
to
eat
that
mary
had
prepared
for
the
supper
every
one
tried
by
merry
frolic
and
dancing
to
make
me
forget
the
catastrophe
and
the
general
bubbling
over
with
fun
inspired
me
to
join
then
he
told
me
to
what
subterfuges
he
had
resorted
to
get
the
house
ready
and
repeated
to
me
again
that
it
was
never
worth
while
to
cry
over
spilled
the
life
of
the
enlisted
men
was
very
dull
during
the
cold
weather
in
the
summer
they
had
mounted
drill
and
parades
and
an
occasional
scout
to
vary
the
life
they
got
very
little
good
out
of
their
horses
in
the
winter
an
hour
in
the
morning
and
another
in
the
afternoon
were
spent
every
day
in
grooming
them
the
general
took
me
down
to
the
stables
sometimes
to
watch
the
work
each
horse
had
the
name
given
to
him
by
his
rider
printed
in
letters
over
his
stall
some
of
the
men
were
so
careful
of
their
horses
that
they
were
able
to
keep
them
for
service
during
the
five
years
of
their
enlistment
the
daily
intercourse
of
horse
and
rider
quickened
the
instinct
of
the
brute
so
that
he
seemed
half
human
indeed
i
have
seen
an
old
from
whose
back
a
raw
recruit
had
tumbled
go
through
the
rest
of
the
drill
as
correctly
as
if
mounted
by
a
soldier
many
of
the
soldiers
love
and
pet
their
dumb
beasts
and
if
the
supply
of
grain
gives
out
on
a
campaign
they
unhesitatingly
steal
for
them
as
a
mother
would
for
a
starving
child
beside
every
stall
hung
the
saddle
and
equipments
of
the
trooper
and
the
companies
vied
with
one
another
in
keeping
them
in
perfect
condition
some
of
the
horses
coats
shone
like
satin
under
the
busy
currycomb
of
an
attached
master
the
captain
of
a
company
and
his
soon
discovered
the
faults
of
a
horse
when
the
preparations
for
a
campaign
began
it
was
really
laughable
to
hear
the
ingenious
excuses
why
an
apparently
sound
horse
should
be
exchanged
for
another
from
the
fresh
supply
in
the
same
way
a
soldier
who
was
hopelessly
worthless
was
often
transferred
to
another
company
the
officers
who
had
been
the
recipient
of
the
undesirable
soldier
would
come
to
the
general
to
complain
i
could
not
always
keep
a
straight
countenance
when
the
injured
captain
narrated
his
wrongs
one
told
of
what
desperate
need
he
had
been
in
for
a
tailor
he
had
been
proffered
this
man
with
many
eulogies
by
a
brother
officer
and
the
final
recommendation
given
which
insured
the
acceptance
of
this
seemingly
generous
offer
was
he
has
made
clothes
for
not
until
the
transfer
was
effected
and
a
suit
of
clothes
ruined
for
the
captain
was
he
told
by
his
liberal
friend
the
whole
story
which
was
oh
yes
he
made
clothes
for
me
but
forgot
to
i
couldn
t
wear
the
general
sympathized
with
the
impatience
of
the
enlisted
men
in
their
dull
life
which
drove
the
sergeants
to
solicit
as
a
privilege
the
transportation
of
the
mail
for
a
man
of
my
husband
s
temperament
it
was
easy
to
understand
that
danger
was
more
endurable
than
the
dead
calm
of
barrack
life
the
telegraph
lines
were
frequently
down
and
except
for
the
courage
of
the
sergeants
we
should
have
been
completely
isolated
from
the
outside
world
with
four
mules
and
the
covered
body
of
a
government
wagon
on
bobs
they
went
over
a
trackless
waste
of
snow
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
occasionally
there
were
huts
that
had
once
been
stage
stations
where
they
could
stop
but
it
was
deadly
perilous
for
them
to
leave
the
telegraph
line
no
matter
through
what
drifts
they
were
compelled
to
plunge
the
bewilderment
of
a
comes
very
soon
an
officer
lying
in
the
hospital
quite
crazed
from
having
been
lost
in
attempting
to
cross
a
only
large
enough
for
the
regiment
in
line
was
a
fearful
warning
to
these
venturesome
men
if
the
mail
sergeant
did
not
appear
when
he
was
due
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
the
general
could
scarcely
restrain
his
anxiety
he
was
so
concerned
for
the
man
s
safety
that
he
kept
going
to
the
window
and
door
incessantly
he
spoke
to
me
so
often
of
his
fears
for
him
that
i
used
to
imagine
he
would
for
once
express
some
of
his
anxiety
when
the
sergeant
finally
appeared
to
report
but
military
usage
was
too
deeply
bred
in
the
bone
of
both
and
the
report
was
made
and
received
with
the
customary
repressed
dignity
of
manner
however
i
have
seen
my
husband
follow
the
man
to
the
door
and
tell
him
that
he
had
felt
great
concern
about
him
and
renew
his
directions
to
take
every
precaution
for
his
safety
how
thankful
i
used
to
be
that
i
was
not
hedged
in
with
a
soldier
s
discipline
but
that
i
could
follow
the
faithful
old
trooper
and
tell
him
how
the
general
had
worried
about
him
and
how
thankful
we
all
were
for
his
safe
return
it
did
not
take
long
for
the
garrison
to
discover
the
poor
mules
with
their
tired
drooping
heads
and
wilted
ears
dragging
the
into
the
post
every
officer
rushed
to
the
adjutant
s
office
for
his
mail
it
was
a
great
event
and
the
letters
were
hailed
with
joy
an
orphan
and
having
no
brothers
and
sisters
i
must
have
been
the
only
one
who
was
contented
not
to
get
any
for
my
world
was
there
an
officer
s
wife
who
could
hardly
wait
for
news
from
her
lonely
delicate
mother
in
the
east
used
to
say
pathetically
realizing
the
distance
that
intervened
that
no
one
knew
what
it
was
to
be
married
to
a
husband
and
a
mother
at
the
same
time
as
soon
as
the
mail
was
distributed
the
general
buried
himself
with
the
newspapers
for
several
days
after
he
agreed
with
me
that
an
old
engraving
called
my
husband
was
a
faithful
likeness
of
him
at
such
a
time
the
picture
represented
a
man
sitting
in
a
chair
completely
hidden
except
his
crossed
legs
and
his
hands
and
clasping
an
outspread
paper
as
soon
as
the
contents
were
devoured
he
cut
from
the
illustrated
papers
comic
pictures
and
adding
to
them
some
doggerel
sent
them
in
to
our
witty
neighbor
as
illustrating
some
joke
that
had
transpired
against
her
with
other
papers
by
a
little
drawing
he
transposed
the
figures
and
likenesses
of
some
of
the
officers
who
had
been
placed
previously
in
some
ludicrous
position
adding
marginal
comments
he
left
the
pictures
uppermost
where
they
were
sure
to
be
seen
by
the
persons
for
whom
they
were
intended
when
they
came
in
as
usual
to
look
over
the
papers
and
magazines
in
his
room
a
clever
lady
in
a
neighboring
garrison
speaking
of
the
arrival
of
the
mail
described
how
voraciously
she
seized
the
new
reading
matter
and
closeted
herself
for
hours
to
read
up
in
advance
of
the
others
she
felt
that
having
exhausted
every
other
topic
she
must
coach
up
on
something
in
spite
of
the
great
risks
and
dangers
of
the
their
journeys
were
accomplished
without
serious
accident
i
used
to
hear
occasionally
that
the
sergeant
had
levied
such
a
heavy
tax
upon
the
citizens
of
bismarck
when
he
brought
small
parcels
through
for
them
that
he
had
quite
a
little
sum
of
money
for
himself
by

perplexities
and
pleasures
of
domestic
life
the
climate
of
dakota
was
so
fine
that
those
who
had
been
poisoned
by
malaria
in
the
south
became
perfectly
well
after
a
short
residence
there
sickness
was
of
rare
occurrence
and
because
of
its
infrequency
it
drew
forth
lavish
sympathy
in
the
autumn
a
beautiful
little
girl
the
daughter
of
the
sutler
was
brought
into
the
garrison
dying
with
diphtheria
there
was
no
law
like
the
city
ordinance
compelling
a
warning
placard
to
be
placed
on
the
door
and
it
would
have
been
of
no
avail
in
keeping
her
friends
away
when
i
begged
the
mother
to
turn
from
the
last
breath
of
her
idol
it
seemed
to
me
her
lot
was
too
hard
for
human
endurance
every
sorrow
seemed
much
worse
out
there
where
we
were
so
unaccustomed
to
suffering
as
i
looked
at
the
little
waxen
body
prepared
for
burial
lying
so
like
a
pretty
flower
i
did
not
wonder
at
the
mother
s
grief
and
despair
she
was
a
thousand
miles
from
eastern
friends
her
husband
was
absent
on
business
and
she
among
strangers
at
another
time
when
a
young
mother
was
caring
for
her
babe
the
little
toddling
brother
was
unfortunately
exposed
to
the
cold
and
fell
violently
ill
with
pneumonia
every
lady
came
daily
to
help
care
for
him
and
at
last
the
officers
repeatedly
proffered
services
were
accepted
for
night
nursing
i
remember
watching
and
admiring
the
tenderness
of
a
handsome
dashing
young
fellow
as
he
walked
the
floor
with
the
feverish
little
sufferer
or
rocked
him
patiently
until
dawn
and
when
i
saw
him
often
afterwards
gliding
about
in
the
dance
or
riding
beside
some
pretty
girl
i
used
to
think
to
myself
that
i
could
tell
his
sweetheart
something
good
about
him
we
were
all
like
one
family
every
one
was
so
quick
to
sympathize
so
ready
to
act
if
trouble
came
after
the
trains
had
been
taken
off
and
winter
had
fairly
set
in
the
young
mother
whom
we
all
loved
was
in
despair
about
clothing
for
her
little
ones
we
had
reached
a
land
where
there
were
no
seamstresses
no
clothing
and
nothing
suitable
for
children
money
did
no
good
though
our
friend
had
abundance
of
that
but
busy
fingers
were
needed
the
ladies
quietly
arranged
as
a
surprise
a
we
impressed
our
brother
tom
into
our
service
and
taught
him
to
use
the
a
laughing
crowd
dropped
scissors
and
thimbles
at
and
followed
to
the
door
to
watch
him
hurry
on
his
belt
and
sabre
and
take
his
place
the
quintessence
then
of
everything
military
and
manly
a
roomful
of
busy
women
cutting
basting
making
and
joining
together
little
garments
soon
had
a
passable
outfit
for
the
brave
mother
s
little
ones
and
even
a
gown
for
her
own
sweet
self
i
do
not
remember
ever
seeing
anything
quite
so
dutchy
and
cumbersome
however
as
those
little
children
dressed
in
the
woollen
clothes
our
ignorant
fingers
had
fashioned
a
woman
on
the
frontier
is
so
cherished
and
appreciated
because
she
has
the
courage
to
live
out
there
that
there
is
nothing
that
is
not
done
for
her
if
she
be
gracious
and
courteous
in
twenty
little
ways
the
officers
spoiled
us
they
never
allowed
us
to
wait
on
ourselves
to
open
or
shut
a
door
draw
up
our
own
chair
or
to
do
any
little
service
that
they
could
perform
for
us
if
we
ran
to
the
next
house
for
a
chat
with
a
shawl
thrown
over
our
heads
we
rarely
got
a
chance
to
return
alone
but
with
this
undignified
were
formally
brought
back
to
our
door
i
wonder
if
it
will
seem
that
we
were
foolishly
petted
if
i
reveal
that
our
husbands
buttoned
our
shoes
wrapped
us
up
if
we
went
out
warmed
our
clothes
before
the
fire
poured
the
water
for
our
bath
out
of
the
heavy
pitcher
and
studied
to
do
innumerable
little
services
that
a
maid
would
have
done
for
us
in
the
states
i
don
t
think
it
made
us
helpless
however
in
our
turn
we
watched
every
chance
we
could
to
anticipate
their
wants
we
did
a
hundred
things
we
would
not
have
remembered
to
do
had
not
the
quickly
passing
time
brought
nearer
each
day
those
hours
of
separation
when
we
would
have
no
one
to
do
for
i
am
sure
i
never
saw
more
tender
men
than
the
officers
one
learned
to
conceal
the
fact
that
one
was
ailing
or
fatigued
for
it
made
them
so
anxious
the
eyes
of
sister
margaret
s
husband
come
to
me
now
full
of
intense
suffering
for
his
wife
as
she
silently
read
her
home
letters
telling
of
our
mother
custer
s
failing
strength
she
suppressed
her
weeping
until
they
had
retired
and
she
believed
him
asleep
she
found
her
mistake
when
his
gentle
hands
stole
softly
to
her
cheeks
to
feel
if
they
were
moistened
with
tears
so
seldom
did
we
hear
of
an
officer
s
unkindness
to
his
wife
that
a
very
old
legend
used
to
be
revived
if
a
reference
to
anything
of
the
kind
was
needed
before
the
war
some
officer
wished
to
measure
the
distance
of
a
day
s
march
and
having
no
odometer
elected
his
wife
to
that
office
the
length
of
the
revolution
of
a
wheel
was
taken
a
white
handkerchief
tied
to
a
spoke
and
the
madam
was
made
to
count
the
rotations
all
day
long
the
story
seldom
failed
to
fire
the
blood
of
the
officers
when
it
was
told
they
agreed
that
nothing
but
a
long
life
among
indians
and
having
the
treatment
of
the
squaw
before
him
would
cause
a
man
to
act
with
such
brutality
domestic
care
sat
very
lightly
on
me
nothing
seemed
to
annoy
my
husband
more
than
to
find
me
in
the
kitchen
he
determinedly
opposed
it
for
years
and
begged
me
to
make
a
promise
that
i
would
never
go
there
for
more
than
a
moment
we
had
such
excellent
servants
that
my
presence
was
unnecessary
most
of
the
time
but
even
in
the
intervals
when
our
fare
was
wretched
he
submitted
uncomplainingly
rather
than
that
i
should
be
wearied
a
great
portion
of
the
time
my
life
was
so
rough
that
he
knew
it
taxed
me
to
the
utmost
and
i
never
forgot
to
be
grateful
that
i
was
spared
domestic
care
in
garrison
we
had
so
much
company
that
though
i
enjoyed
it
i
sometimes
grew
weary
when
the
winter
came
and
there
was
little
to
do
officially
my
husband
made
every
preparation
for
our
receptions
ordered
the
supplies
planned
the
refreshment
and
directed
the
servants
the
consequence
was
that
i
sometimes
had
as
enjoyable
a
time
as
if
i
had
been
entertained
at
some
one
else
s
house
to
prove
how
much
pleasure
i
had
i
recall
a
speech
that
the
family
kept
among
a
collection
of
my
they
overheard
me
saying
to
some
of
our
guests
don
t
go
home
we
are
having
such
a
good
afterwards
the
tormenting
home
circle
asked
me
if
it
would
not
have
been
in
a
little
better
taste
to
let
the
guests
say
that
we
had
such
a
number
of
my
husband
s
family
in
garrison
that
it
required
an
effort
occasionally
to
prevent
our
being
absorbed
in
one
another
a
younger
brother
came
on
from
michigan
to
visit
us
and
our
sister
margaret
s
husband
had
a
sister
and
brother
at
the
post
sometimes
we
found
that
nine
of
us
were
on
one
side
of
the
room
deeply
interested
in
conversation
something
would
rouse
us
to
a
sense
of
our
selfishness
and
i
was
the
one
sent
off
to
look
out
the
quiet
ones
at
the
hop
who
needed
entertaining
if
i
chanced
to
be
struggling
to
teach
new
steps
in
dancing
to
feet
unaccustomed
to
anything
but
march
or
drill
or
strove
to
animate
the
one
whom
all
pronounced
a
bore
the
family
never
failed
to
note
it
they
played
every
sly
trick
they
could
to
disconcert
and
tease
me
i
did
not
submit
tamely
as
soon
as
i
could
i
made
my
way
to
them
and
by
threats
and
intimidations
scattered
them
to
their
duty
at
the
hops
the
officers
waited
long
and
patiently
for
the
women
to
dance
with
them
sometimes
the
first
waltz
they
could
get
during
the
evening
would
not
come
before
midnight
i
think
it
would
have
been
very
hard
for
me
to
have
kept
a
level
head
with
all
the
attention
and
delightful
flattery
which
the
ordinary
manners
of
officers
convey
if
i
had
not
remembered
how
we
ladies
were
always
in
the
minority
the
question
whether
one
was
old
or
young
pretty
or
plain
never
seemed
to
arise
with
them
i
have
seen
them
solicit
the
honor
of
taking
a
grandmamma
to
drive
and
even
to
ride
as
gallantly
as
if
she
were
young
and
fair
no
men
discover
beauty
and
youth
more
quickly
but
the
deference
they
feel
for
all
women
is
always
apparent
it
seemed
very
strange
to
me
that
with
all
the
value
that
is
set
on
the
presence
of
the
women
of
an
officer
s
family
at
the
frontier
posts
the
book
of
army
regulations
makes
no
provision
for
them
but
in
fact
ignores
them
entirely
it
enters
into
such
minute
detail
in
its
instructions
even
giving
the
number
of
hours
that
should
boil
that
it
would
be
natural
to
suppose
that
a
paragraph
or
two
might
be
wasted
on
an
officer
s
wife
the
servants
and
the
company
laundresses
are
mentioned
as
being
entitled
to
quarters
and
rations
and
to
the
services
of
the
surgeon
if
an
officer
s
wife
falls
ill
she
can
not
the
attention
of
the
doctor
though
it
is
almost
unnecessary
to
say
that
she
has
it
through
his
most
urgent
courtesy
i
have
even
known
a
surgeon
who
from
some
official
difficulty
was
not
on
friendly
terms
with
an
officer
go
personally
and
solicit
the
privilege
of
prescribing
through
the
illness
of
his
wife
whom
he
knew
but
slightly
the
officers
used
sportively
to
look
up
the
rules
in
the
army
regulations
for
camp
followers
and
read
them
out
to
us
as
they
would
the
riot
act
in
the
event
of
any
question
being
raised
regarding
our
privileges
we
women
really
came
under
no
other
head
in
the
book
which
is
the
sole
authority
for
our
army
if
we
put
down
an
emphatic
foot
declaring
that
we
were
going
to
take
some
decisive
step
to
which
they
were
justly
opposed
as
involving
our
safety
perhaps
we
would
be
at
once
reminded
in
a
laughingly
exultant
manner
of
the
provision
of
the
law
the
regulations
provide
that
the
commanding
officer
has
complete
control
over
all
with
power
to
put
them
off
the
reservation
or
detain
them
as
he
chooses
nevertheless
though
army
women
have
no
visible
thrones
or
sceptres
nor
any
acknowledged
rights
according
to
military
law
i
never
knew
such
queens
as
they
or
saw
more
willing
subjects
than
they
govern
chapter
xiii
a
strong
heart
dance
the
indian
scouts
employed
by
our
government
and
living
at
our
post
belonged
to
a
tribe
called
the
arickarees
this
tribe
was
small
and
though
not
strong
enough
in
numbers
to
attack
the
more
powerful
sioux
there
was
implacable
enmity
between
them
and
a
constant
desire
for
revenge
during
the
preceding
summer
a
band
of
sioux
came
to
fort
lincoln
and
drew
the
scouts
belonging
to
the
infantry
garrison
out
of
their
quarters
by
some
cunningly
devised
pretext
no
sooner
did
they
appear
than
they
were
fired
upon
by
the
sioux
they
fought
all
day
and
finally
the
rees
succeeded
in
driving
their
enemies
away
all
this
took
place
right
at
the
post
where
the
firing
could
be
seen
from
the
windows
it
was
not
known
how
many
sioux
were
killed
for
all
tribes
make
extraordinary
exertions
to
carry
their
dead
from
the
field
four
only
were
left
after
some
months
the
sioux
for
some
reason
best
known
to
themselves
sent
word
that
they
were
coming
for
a
treaty
the
rees
prepared
to
receive
them
with
what
they
termed
a
strong
heart
dance
a
message
inviting
the
garrison
was
sent
by
them
through
the
interpreter
and
we
hailed
with
relief
the
variety
in
our
existence
this
spectacle
would
afford
indian
life
was
still
a
novelty
to
us
for
we
had
not
been
with
any
peaceable
tribe
before
coming
into
dakota
we
stowed
ourselves
away
in
long
sleighs
which
took
us
to
the
quarters
of
the
scouts
their
buildings
were
of
logs
and
were
long
and
low
in
construction
around
the
walls
on
the
inside
were
bunks
on
which
were
marks
showing
the
quarters
assigned
to
each
family
when
the
outer
door
closed
upon
us
we
could
scarcely
breathe
the
atmosphere
was
stifling
and
loaded
with
the
odor
of
smoked
meat
tanned
skins
and
killikinick
tobacco
the
place
was
lighted
by
burning
logs
in
a
large
fireplace
and
the
deep
shadows
threw
into
the
figures
that
came
into
the
glare
of
the
fire
and
produced
effects
from
which
doré
might
have
found
material
for
a
most
powerful
work
before
the
ceremonies
began
we
women
went
round
the
place
to
see
the
papooses
in
their
mothers
arms
as
they
sat
in
the
bunks
or
on
the
earthen
floor
each
mother
held
her
baby
up
for
our
inspection
with
as
much
pride
as
if
there
had
never
been
a
little
one
on
earth
before
the
squaws
were
not
permitted
to
come
near
the
charmed
circle
in
front
of
the
fire
where
the
mimic
orchestra
beat
their
drums
they
were
allowed
to
sing
at
a
distance
and
joined
in
the
low
monotone
of
the
musicians
at
regular
intervals
as
if
keeping
time
they
jerked
out
a
nasal
twanging
note
which
was
emphasized
by
the
coarse
voices
of
the
warriors
the
dancers
were
naked
except
for
the
customary
covering
over
their
loins
they
had
attached
to
their
belts
beads
and
metal
ornaments
some
had
so
fastened
to
their
girdles
the
feathers
from
the
tail
of
the
wild
turkey
that
they
stood
up
straight
as
the
savages
bent
over
in
the
evolutions
of
the
dance
one
leg
and
arm
would
be
painted
bright
vermilion
or
blue
and
the
other
a
vivid
green
with
cabalistic
characters
drawn
on
them
in
black
the
faces
were
hideous
being
painted
in
all
colors
a
few
had
necklaces
of
bears
claws
on
which
they
set
great
value
these
hung
over
the
bronze
shoulders
the
claws
pointing
into
the
brown
skin
of
their
chests
one
evidently
poorer
than
the
rest
had
a
rudely
cut
shirt
made
out
of
an
old
on
which
the
and
name
of
the
manufacturing
firm
figured
conspicuously
as
his
sole
decoration
another
equally
poor
wore
only
the
covering
over
his
hips
while
suspended
by
a
cord
from
his
neck
was
a
huge
tin
toy
horse
from
the
of
some
there
was
a
strip
of
cloth
falling
to
the
ground
on
which
silver
disks
made
of
coins
were
fastened
at
close
intervals
in
the
plait
of
hair
falling
to
their
waists
we
saw
sticks
crossed
and
running
through
the
braid
the
interpreter
explained
that
these
represented
our
attention
was
arrested
at
once
by
a
little
boy
who
from
time
to
time
during
the
evening
was
brought
to
the
circle
by
his
mother
and
left
to
make
his
little
whirling
gyrations
around
the
ring
of
the
dancers
it
was
explained
to
us
that
he
had
won
his
right
to
join
in
the
festivities
of
the
tribe
when
the
fight
took
place
the
summer
before
to
settle
which
this
treaty
was
planned
of
the
four
sioux
left
on
the
that
day
one
though
mortally
wounded
was
not
yet
dead
when
the
retreat
took
place
a
ree
squaw
knowing
that
it
would
count
her
child
a
coup
if
he
put
another
wound
in
the
already
dying
man
sent
him
out
and
incited
the
child
to
plunge
a
knife
into
the
wounded
warrior
as
a
reward
he
was
given
the
privilege
of
joining
in
all
celebrations
and
the
right
to
wear
an
eagle
feather
standing
straight
from
the
of
his
tiny
head
we
saw
the
mother
s
eyes
gleam
with
pride
as
she
watched
this
miniature
warrior
admitted
among
the
mature
and
experienced
braves
all
the
dancers
rotated
around
together
for
a
time
their
bodies
always
bent
and
they
howled
as
they
moved
in
the
shadowy
gloom
only
momentarily
made
brilliant
by
the
flashes
of
light
from
the
fire
these
grotesque
crouching
figures
were
wild
enough
for
gnomes
only
occasionally
where
there
was
a
large
mixture
of
white
blood
did
we
see
a
figure
the
legs
and
arms
of
indians
are
almost
invariably
thin
none
of
them
ever
do
any
manual
labor
to
produce
muscle
and
their
bones
are
decidedly
conspicuous
we
were
surprised
to
observe
that
though
dancing
in
so
small
a
space
and
weaving
in
and
out
in
countless
figures
without
an
apparent
effort
to
avoid
collisions
they
never
interfered
or
caught
their
brandished
weapons
in
the
ornaments
of
one
another
s
toggery
when
a
warrior
wished
to
speak
he
made
some
sign
to
the
others
they
then
sat
down
around
him
and
the
music
ceased
he
began
with
a
recital
of
his
achievements
indians
never
fail
to
recapitulate
these
as
a
preface
to
each
speech
sometimes
the
speaker
s
career
was
illustrated
and
a
cotton
sheet
was
unfolded
on
which
were
painted
a
number
of
primitive
figures
he
gradually
grew
more
and
more
earnest
his
dull
eyes
glared
as
he
pointed
to
the
scalps
he
had
taken
which
were
even
then
dangling
from
his
belt
finally
the
warrior
began
to
give
presents
and
to
receive
them
in
return
as
is
the
custom
on
those
occasions
if
he
gave
a
pony
he
declared
it
by
throwing
down
a
stick
on
which
were
cut
notches
that
signified
the
gift
to
the
recipient
after
several
had
told
their
coups
for
so
they
designate
their
deeds
of
prowess
one
bounded
with
great
energy
into
the
circle
he
narrated
with
spirit
how
he
had
revenged
the
death
of
two
of
their
band
by
killing
the
murderer
at
the
last
fight
at
the
post
before
any
one
realized
it
an
old
squaw
pushed
her
way
violently
into
the
open
space
threw
down
a
roll
of
calico
at
his
feet
and
flung
off
her
leggings
and
blanket
as
presents
in
her
gratitude
for
it
was
of
her
husband
and
son
that
he
spoke
as
she
was
about
to
complete
the
gift
by
removing
her
last
garment
the
interpreter
in
consideration
for
us
hurried
her
out
to
her
bunk
in
the
darkness
and
we
saw
her
no
more
last
of
all
an
old
sioux
wrapped
in
a
black
mourning
blanket
tottered
into
the
circle
and
silence
settled
down
on
all
he
spoke
of
his
son
who
had
been
in
the
fight
and
had
fallen
bravely
but
said
that
before
he
was
killed
he
had
made
many
rees
bite
the
dust
as
he
then
figuratively
expressed
it
excited
by
the
story
of
the
courage
of
his
offspring
he
tottered
back
to
his
place
but
his
pride
soon
succumbed
to
his
greater
sorrow
he
buried
his
head
in
his
blanket
when
he
sank
down
to
his
seat
hardly
had
he
ceased
before
a
young
ree
leaped
into
the
midst
of
the
warriors
threw
off
his
blanket
and
with
flashing
eye
plunged
into
a
hurried
enumeration
of
his
achievements
to
prove
his
courage
in
days
past
then
striding
up
to
the
bereaved
father
he
said
in
exultant
imperious
tones
boast
no
longer
of
the
successes
of
your
dead
i
who
stand
here
am
he
who
killed
him
the
father
did
not
even
raise
his
eyes
the
ree
called
out
to
the
listening
warriors
will
he
not
fight
me
i
stand
the
old
warrior
remained
unmoved
even
under
the
insolent
words
of
the
aggressor
many
years
of
an
eventful
life
had
made
him
too
well
versed
in
and
too
subservient
to
the
laws
of
indian
warfare
not
to
know
that
a
strong
heart
dance
bound
all
in
inviolable
honor
not
to
break
the
temporary
peace
but
he
knew
that
once
meeting
each
other
on
the
open
plain
there
were
no
restrictions
when
we
left
the
unearthly
music
the
gloom
and
the
barbaric
sights
and
breathed
pure
air
again
it
seemed
as
if
we
had
escaped
from
pandemonium
one
morning
soon
after
that
we
heard
singing
and
found
that
the
squaws
were
surging
down
from
their
quarters
nearly
a
mile
distant
we
had
not
received
a
hint
of
the
honor
to
be
conferred
and
were
mystified
when
they
all
halted
in
front
of
our
house
they
had
come
to
give
us
a
dance
it
was
an
unusual
occurrence
for
the
women
rarely
take
part
in
any
but
the
most
menial
services
they
were
headed
by
long
back
the
wife
of
the
chief
of
the
scouts
she
was
distinguished
as
the
leader
by
a
tall
that
had
been
the
property
of
some
society
man
when
he
wore
civilian
dress
in
the
states
they
began
going
around
after
each
other
in
a
jogging
lumbering
sort
of
movement
and
singing
a
humdrum
song
in
a
minor
key
much
of
the
finery
we
had
seen
at
the
genuine
was
borrowed
from
the
warriors
for
this
occasion
it
was
festooned
over
the
figures
of
the
women
already
well
covered
with
blankets
and
the
weight
was
not
calculated
to
add
materially
to
their
grace
the
ranking
lady
had
a
sabre
which
her
chief
had
received
as
a
present
and
this
she
waved
over
the
others
in
command
one
woman
carried
her
papoose
on
her
back
and
its
little
lolling
head
rolled
from
side
to
side
as
the
mother
trotted
round
and
round
after
the
others
during
the
dance
one
of
the
officers
colored
servants
rushed
out
and
in
his
excitement
almost
ran
his
head
into
the
charmed
precincts
an
infuriated
squaw
to
whom
all
this
mummery
was
the
gravest
and
most
momentous
of
concerns
flew
at
him
brandishing
a
tomahawk
over
his
head
he
had
no
need
to
cry
o
that
this
too
too
solid
flesh
would
melt
for
his
manner
of
vanishing
was
little
short
of
actual
evaporation
into
air
neither
his
master
nor
any
one
else
saw
him
for
hours
afterwards
when
the
women
stopped
their
circumvolutions
for
want
of
breath
we
appeared
on
the
porch
and
made
signs
of
thanks
they
received
them
with
placid
but
the
more
substantial
recognition
of
the
general
s
thanks
in
the
shape
of
a
beef
they
acknowledged
more
warmly
chapter
xiv
garrison
life
there
were
about
forty
in
our
garrison
circle
and
as
we
were
very
harmonious
we
spent
nearly
every
evening
together
i
think
it
is
the
general
belief
that
the
peace
of
an
army
post
depends
very
much
upon
the
example
set
by
the
commanding
officer
my
husband
in
the
six
years
previous
had
made
it
very
clear
in
a
quiet
way
that
he
would
much
prefer
that
there
should
be
no
conversation
detrimental
to
others
in
his
quarters
it
required
no
effort
for
him
to
refrain
from
talking
about
his
neighbors
but
it
was
a
great
deprivation
to
me
occasionally
once
in
a
while
when
some
one
had
brought
down
wrath
upon
his
or
her
head
by
doing
something
deserving
of
censure
the
whole
garrison
was
voluble
in
its
denunciation
and
if
i
plunged
into
the
subject
also
and
gave
my
opinion
i
soon
noticed
my
husband
grow
silent
and
finally
slip
away
i
was
not
long
in
finding
an
excuse
to
follow
him
and
ask
what
i
had
done
of
course
i
knew
him
too
well
not
to
divine
that
i
had
hurt
him
in
some
manner
then
he
would
make
a
renewed
appeal
to
me
beginning
by
an
unanswerable
plea
if
you
wish
to
please
me
and
imploring
me
not
to
join
in
discussions
concerning
any
one
he
used
to
assure
me
that
in
his
heart
he
believed
me
superior
to
such
things
in
vain
i
disclaimed
being
of
that
exalted
order
of
females
and
declared
that
it
required
great
not
to
join
in
a
gossip
the
discussion
ended
by
his
desiring
me
to
use
as
a
if
i
criticise
others
from
motives
of
policy
alone
if
actuated
by
no
higher
incentive
it
seemed
wise
to
suppress
one
s
ebullitions
of
anger
in
the
states
it
is
possible
to
seek
new
friends
if
the
old
ones
become
tiresome
and
exasperating
but
once
in
a
post
like
ours
so
far
removed
there
is
no
one
else
to
whom
one
can
turn
we
never
went
away
on
leave
of
absence
and
heard
ladies
in
civil
life
say
emphatically
that
they
did
not
like
some
person
they
knew
and
never
would
without
a
start
of
terror
i
forgot
that
their
lives
were
not
confined
to
the
small
precincts
of
a
territorial
post
where
such
avowed
enmity
is
disastrous
i
had
very
little
opportunity
to
know
much
of
official
matters
they
were
not
talked
about
at
home
instinct
guided
me
always
in
detecting
the
general
s
enemies
and
when
i
found
them
out
a
struggle
began
between
us
as
to
my
manner
of
treating
them
my
husband
urged
that
it
would
embarrass
him
if
others
found
out
that
i
had
surmised
anything
regarding
official
affairs
he
wished
social
relations
to
be
kept
distinct
and
he
could
not
endure
to
see
me
show
dislike
to
any
one
who
did
not
like
him
i
argued
in
reply
that
i
felt
myself
dishonest
if
i
even
spoke
to
one
whom
i
hated
the
contest
ended
by
his
appealing
to
my
arguing
that
as
the
wife
of
the
commanding
officer
i
belonged
to
every
one
and
in
our
house
i
should
be
hospitable
upon
principle
as
every
one
visited
us
there
was
no
escape
for
me
but
i
do
not
like
to
think
now
of
having
welcomed
any
one
from
whom
i
inwardly
recoiled
i
was
not
let
off
on
such
occasions
with
any
formal
shake
of
the
hand
my
husband
watched
me
and
if
i
was
not
sufficiently
cordial
he
gave
me
afterwards
in
our
bedroom
a
burlesque
imitation
of
my
manner
i
could
not
help
laughing
even
when
annoyed
to
see
him
caricature
me
by
advancing
coldly
extending
the
tips
of
his
fingers
and
bowing
loftily
to
some
imaginary
guest
his
raillery
added
to
my
wish
to
please
him
had
the
effect
of
making
me
shake
hands
so
vigorously
that
i
came
near
erring
the
other
way
and
being
too
demonstrative
and
thus
giving
the
impression
that
i
was
the
best
friend
of
some
one
i
really
dreaded
as
i
was
in
the
tent
during
so
many
summers
and
almost
constantly
in
my
husband
s
library
in
our
winter
quarters
i
naturally
learned
something
of
what
was
transpiring
i
soon
found
however
that
it
would
do
no
good
if
i
asked
questions
in
the
hope
of
gaining
further
information
as
to
curiosity
ever
being
one
of
my
conspicuous
faults
i
do
not
remember
but
i
do
recollect
most
distinctly
how
completely
i
was
taken
aback
by
an
occurrence
which
took
place
a
short
time
after
we
were
married
i
had
asked
some
idle
question
about
official
matters
and
was
promptly
informed
in
a
grave
manner
though
with
a
mischievous
twinkle
of
the
eye
that
whatever
information
i
wanted
could
be
had
by
application
to
the
this
was
the
stereotyped
form
of
endorsement
on
papers
sent
up
to
the
regimental
adjutant
asking
for
information
one
incident
of
many
comes
to
me
now
proving
how
little
i
knew
of
anything
but
what
pertained
to
our
own
home
circle
the
wife
of
an
officer
once
treated
me
with
marked
coldness
i
was
unaware
of
having
hurt
her
in
any
way
and
at
once
took
my
grievance
to
that
source
where
i
found
sympathy
for
the
smallest
woe
my
husband
pondered
a
moment
and
then
remembered
that
the
husband
of
my
friend
and
he
had
had
some
slight
official
difficulty
and
the
lady
thinking
i
knew
of
it
was
taking
her
revenge
on
me
when
i
first
entered
army
life
i
used
to
wonder
what
it
meant
when
i
heard
officers
say
in
a
perfectly
serious
voice
mrs
commands
her
husband
s
it
was
my
not
to
encounter
any
such
female
grenadiers
a
circumstance
occurred
which
made
me
retire
early
from
any
attempt
to
assume
the
slightest
authority
one
of
the
inexhaustible
jokes
that
the
officers
never
permitted
me
to
forget
was
an
occurrence
that
happened
soon
after
the
general
took
command
of
the
cavalry
a
soldier
had
deserted
and
had
stolen
a
large
sum
of
money
from
one
of
the
lieutenants
my
sympathy
was
so
aroused
for
the
officer
that
i
urged
him
to
lose
no
time
in
pursuing
the
man
to
the
nearest
town
whither
he
was
known
to
have
gone
in
my
interest
and
zeal
i
assured
the
officer
that
i
knew
the
general
would
be
willing
and
he
need
not
wait
to
apply
for
leave
through
the
adjutant
s
office
i
even
hurried
him
away
when
the
general
came
in
i
ran
to
him
with
my
story
expecting
his
sympathy
and
that
he
would
endorse
all
that
i
had
done
on
the
contrary
he
quietly
assured
me
that
he
commanded
the
regiment
and
that
he
would
like
me
to
make
it
known
to
the
lieutenant
that
he
must
apply
through
the
proper
channels
for
leave
of
absence
thereupon
i
ate
a
large
piece
of
humble
pie
but
was
relieved
to
find
that
the
officer
had
shown
more
sense
than
i
and
had
not
accepted
my
proferred
leave
but
had
prudently
waited
to
write
out
his
application
years
afterwards
when
my
husband
told
me
what
a
source
of
pride
it
was
to
him
that
others
had
realized
how
little
i
knew
about
official
affairs
and
assured
me
that
my
curiosity
was
less
than
that
of
any
woman
he
had
ever
known
i
took
little
credit
to
myself
it
would
have
been
strange
after
the
drilling
of
military
life
if
i
had
not
attained
some
progress
the
general
planned
every
military
action
with
so
much
secrecy
that
we
were
left
to
divine
as
best
we
could
what
certain
preliminary
movements
meant
one
morning
when
it
was
too
cold
for
anything
but
important
duty
without
any
explanations
he
started
off
with
a
company
of
cavalry
and
several
wagons
as
they
crossed
the
river
on
the
ice
we
surmised
that
he
was
going
to
bismarck
it
seemed
that
the
general
had
been
suspicious
that
the
granaries
were
being
robbed
and
finally
a
citizen
was
caught
driving
off
a
loaded
wagon
of
oats
from
the
reservation
in
broad
daylight
this
was
about
as
an
instance
of
thieving
as
the
general
had
encountered
and
he
quietly
set
to
work
to
find
out
the
accomplices
in
a
little
while
it
was
ascertained
that
the
robbers
had
concealed
their
plunder
in
a
vacant
store
in
the
principal
street
of
bismarck
the
general
determined
to
go
himself
directly
to
the
town
thinking
that
he
could
do
quickly
and
without
opposition
what
another
might
find
difficult
the
better
class
of
citizens
honored
him
too
highly
to
oppose
his
plan
of
action
even
though
it
was
unprecedented
for
the
military
to
enter
a
town
on
such
an
errand
the
general
knew
the
exact
place
at
which
to
halt
and
drew
the
company
up
in
line
in
front
of
the
door
he
demanded
the
key
and
directed
the
men
to
transfer
the
grain
to
the
wagons
outside
without
a
protest
or
an
exchange
of
words
even
the
troops
marched
out
of
the
town
as
quietly
as
they
had
entered
this
ended
the
grain
thefts
it
was
a
surprise
to
me
that
after
the
life
of
excitement
my
husband
had
led
he
should
grow
more
and
more
domestic
in
his
tastes
his
daily
life
was
very
simple
he
rarely
left
home
except
to
hunt
and
was
scarcely
once
a
year
in
the
sutler
s
store
where
the
officers
congregated
to
play
billiards
and
cards
if
the
days
were
too
stormy
or
too
cold
for
hunting
as
they
often
were
for
a
week
or
more
at
a
time
he
wrote
and
studied
for
hours
every
day
we
had
the
to
have
a
loaned
us
by
the
sutler
and
in
the
upper
room
where
it
was
placed
my
husband
and
i
had
many
a
game
when
he
was
weary
with
writing
the
general
sometimes
sketched
the
outline
of
my
pictures
which
i
was
preparing
to
paint
for
he
drew
better
than
i
did
and
gladly
availed
himself
of
a
chance
to
secure
variety
of
occupation
the
relatives
of
the
two
young
housemaids
whom
we
had
in
our
service
regretted
that
they
were
missing
school
so
the
general
had
the
patience
to
teach
them
the
day
rarely
passed
that
tom
my
husband
and
i
did
not
have
a
game
of
romps
the
grave
orderly
who
sat
by
the
used
to
be
shocked
to
see
the
commanding
officer
in
hot
pursuit
of
us
up
the
steps
the
quick
transformation
which
took
place
when
he
was
called
from
the
frolic
to
receive
the
report
of
the
officer
of
the
day
was
something
very
ridiculous
occasionally
he
joined
those
who
gathered
in
our
parlor
every
evening
he
had
a
very
keen
sense
of
his
social
responsibilities
as
and
believed
that
our
house
should
be
open
at
all
hours
to
the
garrison
his
own
studious
habits
made
it
a
deprivation
if
he
gave
up
much
of
his
time
to
entertaining
i
learned
that
in
no
way
could
i
relieve
him
so
much
as
by
being
always
ready
to
receive
he
grew
to
expect
that
i
would
be
in
the
parlor
at
night
and
plan
whatever
diversions
we
had
i
managed
to
slip
away
several
times
in
the
evening
and
go
to
him
for
a
little
visit
or
possibly
a
waltz
while
the
rest
danced
in
the
other
room
if
i
delayed
going
to
him
while
absorbed
in
the
general
amusement
a
knock
at
the
door
announced
the
orderly
carrying
a
note
for
me
those
missives
always
reminded
me
of
my
forgetfulness
in
some
ingenious
arrangement
of
words
when
i
laughed
outright
over
one
of
these
little
scraps
our
friends
begged
me
to
share
the
fun
with
them
it
was
only
a
line
and
read
do
you
think
i
am
a
confirmed
monk
of
course
they
insisted
laughingly
upon
my
going
at
once
to
the
hermit
we
spent
the
days
together
almost
uninterruptedly
during
the
winter
the
garrison
gave
me
those
hours
and
left
us
alone
my
husband
had
arranged
my
and
next
to
his
desk
and
he
read
to
me
constantly
at
one
time
we
had
read
five
authorities
on
napoleon
whose
military
career
was
a
source
of
interest
to
him
he
studied
so
carefully
that
he
kept
the
atlas
before
him
and
marked
the
course
of
the
two
armies
of
the
french
and
english
with
pencils
of
different
color
one
of
his
favorite
books
was
a
life
of
daniel
webster
given
him
in
the
states
by
a
dear
friend
anything
sad
moved
him
so
that
his
voice
choked
with
emotion
and
i
have
known
him
lay
down
the
book
and
tell
me
he
could
not
go
on
one
of
the
many
passages
in
that
beautifully
written
book
which
my
husband
thought
the
most
utterly
pathetic
of
all
was
the
tribute
an
old
farmer
had
paid
to
the
dead
statesman
looking
down
upon
the
face
of
the
orator
for
the
last
time
the
old
man
says
in
soliloquy
ah
daniel
the
world
will
be
lonesome
now
you
are
gone
i
became
so
accustomed
to
this
quiet
life
in
the
library
with
my
husband
that
i
rarely
went
out
if
i
did
begin
the
rounds
of
our
little
circle
with
our
whom
every
one
besought
to
visit
them
an
orderly
soon
followed
us
up
without
the
glint
of
a
smile
and
in
exactly
the
tone
of
a
man
giving
the
order
for
a
battle
he
said
the
general
presents
his
compliments
and
would
like
to
know
when
he
shall
send
the
trunks
i
recollect
a
message
of
this
sort
being
once
brought
to
us
when
we
were
visiting
an
intimate
friend
by
the
tallest
most
formidable
soldier
in
the
regiment
it
was
a
mystery
to
us
how
he
managed
to
deliver
his
errand
without
moving
a
muscle
of
his
face
he
presented
the
compliments
of
the
commanding
officer
and
added
he
sent
you
we
did
not
trust
ourselves
to
look
up
at
his
lofty
face
but
took
from
his
extended
bands
two
bundles
of
white
muslin
there
was
no
mistaking
the
shape
they
were
our
when
we
hurried
home
and
took
the
general
to
task
for
making
us
face
the
solemn
orderly
he
only
replied
by
asking
if
we
had
intended
to
stay
forever
pointing
to
his
open
watch
and
speaking
of
the
terrors
of
solitary
confinement
it
was
the
custom
at
guard
mount
every
morning
to
select
the
cleanest
most
man
for
duty
as
orderly
for
the
it
was
considered
the
highest
honor
and
really
was
something
of
a
holiday
as
the
man
detailed
for
this
duty
had
but
little
to
do
and
then
had
his
night
in
bed
otherwise
belonging
to
the
guard
and
being
newly
appointed
every
hours
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
break
his
rest
to
go
on
picket
duty
at
intervals
all
night
there
was
great
strife
to
get
this
position
and
it
was
difficult
for
the
adjutant
to
make
the
selection
he
sometimes
carried
his
examination
so
far
as
to
try
and
find
dust
on
the
carbines
with
his
cambric
handkerchief
guard
mount
in
pleasant
weather
with
the
adjutant
and
officer
of
the
day
in
full
uniform
each
soldier
perfect
in
dress
with
the
band
playing
was
a
very
interesting
ceremony
in
dakota
s
severe
cold
it
looked
like
a
parade
of
animals
at
the
zoo
all
were
compelled
to
wear
buffalo
overcoats
and
shoes
fur
caps
and
gloves
when
the
orderly
removed
these
heavy
outside
wraps
however
he
stood
out
as
fine
a
specimen
of
manhood
as
one
ever
sees
his
place
in
our
hall
was
near
the
stove
and
on
the
table
by
his
side
were
papers
and
magazines
many
of
which
were
sent
by
the
young
men
s
christian
association
of
new
york
the
general
had
once
met
the
secretary
of
the
society
and
in
response
to
his
inquiry
about
he
impressed
him
by
a
strong
statement
of
what
a
treasure
anything
of
the
kind
was
at
an
isolated
post
there
was
usually
a
variety
of
but
one
day
the
orderly
stole
out
to
the
cook
with
a
complaint
he
asked
for
the
general
s
field
and
or
wilkes
s
of
the
which
he
was
accustomed
to
find
awaiting
him
and
confessed
that
those
pious
papers
were
too
bagoted
for
him
he
usually
sat
still
all
day
only
taking
an
occasional
message
for
the
general
or
responding
to
a
beckoning
invitation
from
mary
s
brown
finger
at
the
there
he
found
a
little
offering
from
her
of
home
things
to
eat
occasionally
in
the
evening
the
general
forgot
to
dismiss
him
at
taps
after
that
a
warning
cough
issued
from
the
hall
when
this
had
been
repeated
several
times
my
husband
used
to
look
up
so
merrily
and
say
to
me
it
was
remarkable
how
temporary
consumption
increased
after
the
hour
of
bedtime
had
come
when
the
general
had
a
message
to
send
he
opened
his
door
and
rattled
off
his
order
so
fast
that
it
was
almost
impossible
for
one
unacquainted
with
his
voice
to
understand
if
i
saw
the
dazed
eyes
of
a
new
soldier
i
divined
that
probably
he
did
not
catch
a
word
without
the
general
s
noticing
it
i
slipped
through
our
room
into
the
hall
and
translated
the
message
to
him
when
i
returned
and
gave
my
husband
the
best
imitation
i
could
of
the
manner
in
which
he
spoke
when
hurried
and
described
the
orderly
standing
rubbing
his
perplexed
head
over
the
unintelligible
gibberish
he
threw
himself
on
the
lounge
in
peals
of
laughter
while
we
were
in
the
states
sometimes
he
was
invited
to
address
audiences
but
being
unaccustomed
to
public
speaking
and
easily
embarrassed
he
made
very
droll
attempts
he
realized
that
he
had
not
the
gift
of
oratory
and
i
used
to
wish
that
he
would
practise
the
art
i
insisted
that
if
he
continued
to
speak
so
fast
in
public
i
would
be
obliged
to
stand
beside
him
on
the
platform
as
interpreter
for
his
hearers
or
else
take
my
position
in
the
audience
and
send
him
a
sign
of
warning
from
there
i
proposed
to
do
something
so
startling
that
he
could
not
help
checking
his
mad
speed
he
was
so
earnest
about
everything
he
did
i
assured
him
no
ordinary
signal
would
answer
and
we
finished
the
laughing
discussion
by
my
volunteering
to
rise
in
the
audience
the
next
time
he
spoke
and
raise
an
umbrella
as
a
warning
to
slacken
up
chapter
xv
general
custer
s
literary
work
when
my
husband
began
to
write
for
publication
it
opened
to
him
a
world
of
interest
and
afterwards
proved
an
unfailing
source
of
occupation
in
the
long
dakota
winters
i
think
he
had
no
idea
when
it
was
first
suggested
to
him
that
he
could
write
when
we
were
in
new
york
several
years
before
he
told
me
how
perfectly
surprised
he
was
to
have
one
of
the
magazine
editors
seek
him
out
and
ask
him
to
contribute
articles
every
month
and
a
few
days
after
he
said
i
begin
to
think
the
editor
does
not
imagine
that
i
am
hesitating
about
accepting
his
offer
because
i
doubt
my
ability
as
a
writer
but
because
he
said
nothing
about
payment
at
first
for
he
added
not
yet
over
his
surprise
at
what
seemed
to
him
a
large
sum
he
came
again
and
offered
me
a
hundred
dollars
for
each
we
at
once
seemed
to
ourselves
bonanzas
many
times
afterwards
we
enjoyed
intensely
the
little
pleasures
and
luxuries
given
us
by
what
his
pen
added
to
the
family
exchequer
on
the
frontier
where
the
commanding
officer
keeps
open
house
he
has
little
opportunity
to
have
more
than
a
passing
glimpse
of
his
pay
accounts
so
quickly
do
they
go
to
settle
table
expenses
it
made
very
little
difference
to
us
though
our
tastes
became
more
simple
each
year
that
we
lived
so
much
there
was
little
dress
competition
in
garrison
and
in
no
way
could
we
enjoy
the
general
s
salary
more
than
in
entertaining
at
our
first
post
after
the
war
the
idle
tediousness
of
the
life
was
in
such
contrast
to
the
whirl
and
dash
of
the
years
just
passed
that
the
days
seemed
insupportable
to
my
husband
while
there
we
entertained
a
charming
officer
of
the
old
school
his
experience
and
age
made
me
venture
to
speak
to
him
confidentially
of
the
sympathy
i
felt
for
the
aimlessness
of
my
husband
s
life
i
was
in
despair
trying
to
think
of
some
way
in
which
to
vary
the
monotony
for
though
he
said
little
i
could
see
how
he
fretted
and
chafed
under
such
an
existence
the
old
officer
appreciated
what
i
told
him
and
after
thinking
seriously
for
a
time
urged
me
to
try
and
induce
him
to
explore
new
territory
and
write
descriptive
articles
for
publication
when
the
actual
offer
came
afterwards
it
seemed
to
me
i
used
every
persuasive
argument
in
my
power
to
induce
him
to
accept
i
thought
only
of
its
filling
up
the
idle
hours
i
believed
that
he
had
the
gift
of
a
ready
writer
for
though
naturally
reticent
he
could
talk
remarkably
well
when
started
i
had
learned
to
practise
a
little
stratagem
in
order
to
draw
him
out
i
used
to
begin
a
story
and
purposely
bungle
so
that
in
despair
he
would
take
it
up
and
in
rapid
graphic
sentences
place
the
whole
scene
before
us
afterwards
he
was
commended
for
writing
as
he
talked
and
making
his
descriptions
of
plains
life
pen
the
general
said
to
me
that
it
was
with
difficulty
he
suppressed
a
smile
when
his
publisher
remarked
to
him
that
his
writing
showed
the
result
of
great
care
and
painstaking
the
truth
was
he
dashed
off
page
after
page
without
copying
or
correcting
he
had
no
dates
or
journal
to
aid
him
but
trusted
to
his
memory
to
take
him
back
over
a
period
of
sixteen
years
i
sat
beside
him
while
he
wrote
and
sometimes
thought
him
too
intent
on
his
work
to
notice
my
going
away
he
would
follow
shortly
and
declare
that
he
would
not
write
another
line
unless
i
returned
this
was
an
effectual
threat
for
he
was
constantly
behind
and
even
out
there
heard
the
cry
for
copy
which
the
printer
s
devil
is
always
represented
as
making
i
never
had
anything
to
do
with
his
writing
except
to
be
the
prod
which
drove
him
to
begin
he
used
to
tell
me
that
on
some
near
date
he
had
promised
an
article
and
would
ask
me
solemnly
to
declare
to
him
that
i
would
give
him
no
peace
until
he
had
prepared
the
material
in
vain
i
replied
that
to
accept
the
position
of
nag
and
torment
was
far
from
desirable
he
exacted
the
promise
when
he
was
in
the
mood
for
writing
we
used
laughingly
to
refer
to
it
to
each
other
as
genius
at
such
times
we
printed
on
a
card
this
is
my
busy
day
and
hung
it
on
the
door
it
was
my
part
to
go
out
and
propitiate
those
who
objected
to
the
general
shutting
himself
up
to
work
while
my
father
lived
he
used
to
ask
me
if
i
realized
what
an
eventful
life
i
was
leading
and
never
ceased
to
inquire
in
his
letters
if
i
was
keeping
a
journal
when
the
most
interesting
portions
of
our
life
were
passing
each
day
represented
such
a
struggle
on
my
part
to
endure
the
fatigues
and
hardships
that
i
had
no
energy
left
to
write
a
line
when
the
evening
came
my
husband
tried
for
years
to
incite
me
to
write
and
besought
me
to
make
an
attempt
as
i
sat
by
him
while
he
worked
i
greatly
regret
that
i
did
not
for
if
i
had
i
would
not
now
be
entirely
without
notes
or
dates
and
obliged
to
trust
wholly
to
memory
for
events
of
our
life
eleven
years
ago
when
my
husband
returned
from
the
east
in
the
spring
of
he
had
hardly
finished
his
greeting
before
he
said
let
me
get
a
book
that
i
have
been
reading
and
which
i
have
marked
for
while
he
sought
it
in
his
i
brought
one
to
him
telling
him
that
i
had
underlined
much
of
it
for
him
and
though
it
was
a
novel
and
he
rarely
read
novels
he
must
make
this
book
an
exception
what
was
our
surprise
to
find
that
we
had
selected
the
same
story
and
marked
many
of
the
same
passages
one
sentiment
which
the
general
had
enclosed
with
double
brackets
in
pencil
was
a
line
spoken
by
the
hero
who
is
an
author
he
begs
the
heroine
to
write
magazine
articles
assuring
her
she
can
do
far
better
than
he
ever
did
once
when
on
leave
of
absence
the
general
dined
with
an
old
officer
whose
high
character
and
long
experience
made
whatever
he
said
of
real
value
he
congratulated
my
husband
on
his
success
as
a
writer
but
added
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
custer
they
say
that
your
wife
wrote
the
magazine
if
they
say
that
replied
my
husband
they
pay
me
the
highest
compliment
that
i
could
possibly
ah
well
replied
the
generous
friend
whoever
wrote
them
they
certainly
reflect
great
credit
on
the
my
husband
wrote
much
but
was
not
a
voluble
talker
as
i
have
said
most
of
the
entertaining
devolved
upon
me
and
the
fact
that
i
often
spoke
of
the
scenes
in
his
life
on
the
plains
that
we
had
shared
together
must
have
been
the
reason
why
some
persons
listening
to
the
stories
ascribed
the
book
to
me
as
for
my
congratulations
the
very
highest
meed
of
praise
i
could
give
him
was
that
he
had
not
taken
the
opportunity
offered
in
describing
his
life
in
the
book
to
defend
himself
against
the
unjust
charges
of
his
enemies
i
had
found
that
they
expected
and
dreaded
it
for
the
pen
is
mightier
than
the
sword
and
military
people
are
quick
to
realize
it
my
husband
appreciated
my
having
noticed
what
he
studied
to
avoid
though
while
i
commended
i
frankly
owned
i
could
not
have
been
equal
to
the
task
of
resisting
what
could
not
but
be
a
temptation
to
retaliate
chapter

indian
depredations
long
after
the
flowers
were
blooming
in
the
states
the
tardy
spring
began
to
appear
in
the
far
north
the
snow
slowly
melted
and
the
ice
commenced
to
thaw
on
the
river
for
a
moment
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
imagine
the
privilege

again

the
sod
without
peril
of
freezing
the
next
instant
the
dread
of
the
coming
campaign
which
summer
is
almost
certain
to
bring
to
a
cavalry
command
filled
every
thought
and
made
me
wish
that
our
future
life
could
be
spent
where
the
thermometer
not
only
went
down
to
twenty
degrees
below
zero
but
remained
there
when
i
spied
the
first
tiny
blade
of
grass
i
used
to
find
myself
acting
like
a
child
and
grinding
the
innocent
green
with
my
heel
back
from
where
it
sprang
the
first
bunch
of
flowers
that
the
soldiers
brought
me
long
before
the
ground
had
begun
to
take
on
even
a
faint
emerald
tint
were
a
variety
of
anemone
a
bit
of
blue
set
deep
down
in
a
cup
of
outer
petals
of
gray
these
were
so
thick
and
fuzzy
they
looked
like
a
surrounding
of
gray
blanket
and
well
the
flowers
needed
such
protection
on
the
bleak
hills
where
they
grew
they
were
a
great
novelty
and
i
wanted
to
go
and
seek
them
myself
but
my
husband
gave
me
the
strictest
injunction
in
reply
not
to
step
outside
the
garrison
limits
we
had
received
warning
only
a
short
time
before
that
the
indians
had
crawled
out
of
their
winter
tepees
and
we
knew
ourselves
to
be
so
surrounded
that
it
became
necessary
to
station
pickets
on
the
high
ground
at
the
rear
of
the
post
on
the
first
mild
day
my
husband
and
i
rode
over
to
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
which
was
considered
the
safe
side
thinking
ourselves
secure
from
danger
there
we
kept
on
further
than
we
realized
a
magnificent
deer
startled
by
our
voices
and
laughter
and
yet
too
well
hidden
by
the
underbrush
to
see
us
resorted
to
a
device
habitual
with
deer
when
they
wish
to
see
over
an
extent
of
country
he
made
a
leap
straight
into
the
air
his
superb
head
turned
to
us
searchingly
he
seemed
hardly
to
touch
the
earth
as
he
bounded
away
it
was
too
great
a
temptation
to
resist
we
did
not
follow
far
though
for
we
had
neither
dogs
nor
gun
scarcely
any
time
elapsed
before
an
officer
and
a
detachment
of
men
riding
over
the
ground
where
we
had
started
the
deer
but
obliged
to
pursue
their
way
further
up
the
valley
as
they
were
on
duty
came
to
a
horrible
sight
the
body
of
a
white
man
was
staked
out
on
the
ground
and
disembowelled
there
yet
remained
the
embers
of
the
smouldering
fire
that
consumed
him
if
the
indians
are
hurried
for
time
and
can
not
stay
to
witness
the
prolonged
torture
of
their
victim
it
is
their
custom
to
pinion
the
captive
and
place
hot
coals
on
his
vitals
the
horror
and
fright
this
gave
us
women
lasted
for
a
time
and
rendered
unnecessary
the
continued
warnings
of
our
husbands
about
walking
outside
the
line
of
the
pickets
even
with
all
the
admonitions
we
began
to
grow
desperate
and
chafed
under
the
imprisonment
that
confined
us
to
a
little
square
of
earth
month
in
and
month
out
one
day
temptation
came
suddenly
upon
us
as
three
of
us
were
loitering
on
the
outskirts
of
the
post
the
soldier
who
drove
our
the
imperturbable
burkman
came
near
we
cajoled
him
into
letting
us
get
in
and
take
ever
so
short
a
turn
down
the
valley
delighted
to
have
our
freedom
again
we
wheedled
the
man
to
go
a
little
and
a
little
at
last
even
he
amiable
as
he
was
refused
to
be
coaxed
any
longer
and
he
turned
around
we
realized
then
how
far
away
we
were
but
we
were
not
so
far
that
we
could
not
plainly
discover
a
group
of
officers
on
the
veranda
at
our
quarters
they
were
gesticulating
wildly
and
beckoning
to
us
with
all
their
might
as
we
drove
nearer
we
could
almost
see
by
a
certain
movement
of
the
lower
jaw
that
the
word
being
framed
was
one
that
seems
to
be
used
in
all
climates
for
extreme
cases
of
aggravation
they
were
all
provoked
and
caught
us
out
of
the
carriage
and
set
us
down
after
a
little
salute
for
all
the
world
like
mothers
i
have
seen
who
receive
their
children
from
narrow
escapes
with
alternate
shakings
and
hugs
it
seemed
hard
to
tell
whether
anger
or
delight
predominated
in
vain
we
made
excuses
when
order
was
restored
and
we
could
all
speak
articulately
we
were
then
solemnly
sworn
each
one
separately
never
to
do
such
a
foolhardy
thing
again
the
government
had
made
a
special
appropriation
for
rations
to
be
distributed
through
the
officers
to
the
suffering
farmers
throughout
minnesota
and
dakota
whose
crops
had
been
destroyed
by
grasshoppers
as
we
were
on
the
side
of
the
river
with
the
warlike
indians
we
knew
of
but
one
ranch
near
us
it
was
owned
by
an
old
man
who
had
been
several
times
to
the
general
for
assistance
he
was
a
man
of
extraordinary
courage
for
he
had
located
his
claim
too
far
away
from
any
one
to
be
able
to
obtain
assistance
if
he
needed
it
he
never
left
his
home
except
to
bring
into
market
the
skins
that
he
had
trapped
or
his
crops
when
the
season
was
profitable
he
was
so
quaint
and
peculiar
and
so
very
grateful
for
the
help
given
him
that
my
husband
wanted
me
to
hear
him
express
his
thanks
the
next
time
he
came
the
door
into
our
room
was
left
open
in
order
that
i
might
listen
to
what
otherwise
he
would
have
been
too
shy
to
utter
he
blessed
the
general
in
the
most
touching
and
solemn
manner
the
tears
were
in
his
eyes
and
answering
ones
rose
in
my
husband
s
for
no
old
person
failed
to
appeal
to
his
sympathies
and
recall
his
own
aged
parents
referring
to
some
domestic
troubles
that
he
had
previously
confided
to
the
general
he
spoke
of
their
having
driven
him
beyond
the
pale
of
civilization
when
he
was
old
and
feeble
and
compelled
him
to
take
his
dinner
of
herbs
in
a
deserted
spot
at
this
point
in
his
narrative
the
door
was
significantly
shut
and
i
was
thus
made
aware
that
the
gratitude
part
was
all
that
i
was
to
be
permitted
to
hear
my
husband
considered
his
confidence
sacred
we
knew
that
the
old
man
lived
a
hermit
s
life
entirely
alone
the
year
through
in
the
blizzards
he
could
not
leave
his
without
being
in
danger
of
freezing
to
death
some
time
after
this
a
scout
brought
word
that
during
the
spring
he
had
passed
the
ranch
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
of
the
old
man
the
general
suspected
something
wrong
and
took
a
company
himself
to
go
to
the
place
he
found
that
the
indians
had
been
there
had
dismantled
and
robbed
the
house
driven
off
the
cattle
and
horses
and
strewn
the
road
with
plunder
on
the
stable
floor
lay
the
body
of
the
harmless
old
man
his
silvery
hair
lying
in
a
pool
of
blood
where
he
had
been
beaten
to
death
they
were
obliged
to
return
and
leave
his
death
unavenged
for
by
the
time
the
first
news
reached
us
the
murderers
were
far
away
chapter
xvii
a
day
of
anxiety
and
terror
when
the
air
became
milder
it
was
a
delight
after
our
long
housing
to
be
able
to
dawdle
on
the
piazza
the
valley
below
us
was
beginning
to
show
a
tinge
of
verdure
several
hundred
mules
belonging
to
the
train
dotted
the
turf
and
nibbled
as
best
they
could
the
sprouting
grass
half
a
dozen
citizens
lounged
on
the
sod
sleepily
guarding
the
herd
for
these
mules
were
hired
by
the
government
from
a
contractor
one
morning
we
were
walking
back
and
forth
looking
as
we
never
tired
of
doing
down
the
long
level
plain
when
we
were
startled
by
shouts
we
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
piazza
and
saw
the
prisoners
who
had
been
working
outside
the
post
and
the
guard
who
had
them
in
charge
coming
in
at
a
a
hatless
and
breathless
herder
dashed
up
to
the
officer
on
an
unsaddled
mule
with
blanched
face
and
protruding
eyeballs
he
called
out
that
the
indians
were
running
off
the
herd
the
general
came
hastily
out
just
in
time
to
see
a
cloud
of
dust
rising
through
a
gap
in
the
bluffs
marking
the
direction
taken
by
the
stampeded
mules
instantly
he
shouted
with
his
clear
voice
to
the
bugler
to
sound
the
call
boots
and
saddles
and
keep
it
up
until
he
told
him
to
stop
the
first
notes
of
the
trumpet
had
hardly
sounded
before
the
porches
of
the
company
quarters
and
the
parade
were
alive
with
men
every
one
without
stopping
to
question
rushed
from
the
barracks
and
officers
quarters
to
the
stables
the
men
threw
their
saddles
on
their
horses
and
galloped
out
to
the
soldiers
who
were
solely
on
garrison
duty
and
to
whom
no
horse
was
assigned
stole
whatever
ones
they
could
find
even
those
of
the
messengers
tied
to
the
others
vaulted
on
to
mules
barebacked
some
were
in
jackets
others
in
their
flannel
many
were
hatless
and
occasionally
a
head
was
tied
up
with
a
handkerchief
it
was
anything
but
a
crowd
but
every
one
was
ready
for
action
and
such
creatures
it
is
rarely
one
s
lot
to
see
finding
the
reason
for
the
hasty
summons
when
they
all
gathered
together
they
could
hardly
brook
even
a
few
moments
delay
the
general
did
not
tarry
to
give
any
but
brief
directions
he
detailed
an
officer
to
remain
in
charge
of
the
garrison
and
left
him
some
hurried
instructions
he
stopped
to
caution
me
again
not
to
go
outside
the
post
and
with
a
hasty
flung
himself
into
the
saddle
and
was
off
the
command
spurred
their
horses
towards
the
opening
in
the
bluff
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
through
which
the
last
mules
had
passed
in
twenty
minutes
from
the
first
alarm
the
garrison
was
emptied
and
we
women
stood
watching
the
cloud
of
dust
that
the
hoofs
of
the
regimental
horses
had
stirred
as
they
hurled
themselves
through
the
cleft
in
the
hills
we
had
hardly
collected
our
senses
before
we
found
that
we
were
almost
deserted
as
a
rule
there
are
enough
soldiers
on
garrison
duty
who
do
not
go
on
scouts
to
protect
the
post
but
in
the
mad
haste
of
the
morning
and
impelled
by
indignant
fury
at
having
the
herd
swept
away
from
under
their
very
noses
as
it
were
all
this
had
precipitately
left
without
permission
fortunately
for
them
and
his
own
peace
of
mind
regarding
our
safety
the
general
did
not
know
of
this
until
he
returned
besides
the
officers
never
dreamed
the
pursuit
would
last
for
more
than
a
mile
or
so
as
they
had
been
so
quick
in
preparing
to
follow
after
our
gasping
and
wild
had
subsided
a
little
we
realized
that
in
addition
to
our
anxiety
for
those
who
had
just
left
us
we
were
in
peril
ourselves
the
women
with
one
instinct
gathered
together
though
indians
rarely
attack
a
post
directly
the
pickets
that
were
stationed
on
the
low
hills
at
the
rear
of
the
garrison
had
been
fired
upon
previously
we
also
feared
that
the
buildings
would
be
set
on
fire
by
the
wily
creeping
savages
it
was
even
thought
that
the
running
off
of
the
herd
was
but
a
ruse
to
get
the
garrison
out
in
order
to
attack
the
post
of
course
we
knew
that
only
a
portion
of
the
indians
had
produced
the
stampede
and
we
feared
that
the
remainder
were
waiting
to
continue
the
depredations
and
were
aware
of
our
depleted
numbers
huddled
together
in
an
inner
room
we
first
tried
to
devise
schemes
for
secreting
ourselves
the
quarters
had
then
no
cellars
how
we
regretted
that
a
cave
had
not
been
prepared
in
the
hill
back
of
us
for
hiding
the
women
in
emergencies
our
means
of
escape
by
the
river
were
uncertain
as
the
was
in
a
shocking
condition
besides
the
citizens
in
charge
would
very
naturally
detain
the
boat
upon
some
pretext
on
the
safe
side
of
the
river
finally
nervous
and
trembling
over
these
conferences
we
returned
to
the
piazza
and
tried
to
think
that
it
was
time
for
the
return
of
the
regiment
our
house
being
the
last
in
the
line
and
commanding
an
extended
view
of
the
valley
we
kept
our
lookout
there
each
of
us
took
turns
in
mounting
the
porch
railing
and
held
there
in
place
by
the
others
fixed
the
on
the
little
spot
of
earth
through
which
the
command
had
vanished
with
a
plaintive
little
laugh
one
of
our
number
called
out
the
inquiry
that
has
symbolized
all
beleaguered
women
from
time
immemorial
sister
anne
do
you
see
any
one
coming
all
of
us
scanned
the
horizon
unflaggingly
we
knew
the
indian
mode
of
taking
observation
they
pile
a
few
stones
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
after
dark
before
dawn
they
creep
up
stealthily
from
the
farther
side
and
hiding
behind
the
slight
protection
watch
all
day
long
with
unwearying
patience
these
little
picket
posts
of
theirs
were
scattered
all
along
the
bluffs
we
scarcely
allowed
ourselves
to
take
our
eyes
off
them
once
in
a
while
one
of
our
group
on
watch
called
out
that
something
was
moving
behind
the
rocks
chairs
were
brought
out
and
placed
beside
her
in
order
that
a
second
pair
of
eyes
might
confirm
the
statement
this
threw
our
little
shivering
group
into
new
panics
there
was
a
window
in
the
servants
room
at
the
rear
of
the
house
to
and
from
which
we
ascended
and
descended
all
day
long
i
do
not
think
the
actual
fear
of
death
was
thought
of
so
much
as
the
terror
of
capture
our
regiment
had
rescued
some
white
women
from
captivity
in
kansas
and
we
never
forgot
their
stories
one
of
our
number
became
so
convinced
that
their
fate
awaited
us
that
she
called
a
resolute
woman
one
side
to
implore
her
to
promise
that
when
the
indians
came
into
the
post
she
would
put
a
bullet
through
her
heart
before
she
carried
out
her
determination
to
shoot
herself
we
sincerely
discussed
whether
in
extreme
danger
we
could
be
counted
upon
to
load
and
fire
a
carbine
it
would
be
expected
that
army
women
would
know
a
great
deal
about
i
knew
but
few
who
did
i
never
even
went
into
the
corner
of
my
husband
s
library
where
he
kept
his
stand
of
unloaded
arms
if
i
could
help
it
i
am
compelled
to
confess
that
the
holster
of
a
pistol
gave
me
a
shiver
one
of
our
ladies
however
had
a
little
of
the
mollie
pitcher
spirit
she
had
shot
at
a
mark
and
she
promised
to
teach
us
to
put
in
the
cartridges
and
discharge
the
piece
we
were
filled
with
envy
because
she
produced
a
tiny
remington
pistol
that
heretofore
she
had
carried
in
her
pocket
when
travelling
in
the
states
it
was
not
much
larger
than
a
and
we
could
not
help
doubting
its
power
to
damage
she
did
not
insist
that
it
would
kill
but
even
at
such
a
time
we
had
to
laugh
at
the
vehement
manner
in
which
she
declared
that
she
could
disable
the
leg
of
an
enemy
she
seemed
to
think
that
sufficient
pluck
would
be
left
to
finish
him
afterwards
the
officer
who
had
remained
in
command
was
obliged
to
see
that
the
few
troopers
left
were
armed
and
afterwards
he
visited
the
pickets
then
he
came
to
us
and
tried
to
quiet
our
fears
and
from
that
time
his
life
became
a
burden
we
questioned
twenty
times
his
idea
as
to
he
thought
the
command
had
gone
it
would
come
back
and
such
other
aimless
queries
as
only
the
ingenuity
of
frightened
women
can
devise
he
was
driven
almost
desperate
in
assuring
us
that
he
hoped
there
was
no
immediate
danger
he
asked
us
to
remember
that
the
infantry
post
was
near
enough
to
give
assistance
if
we
needed
it
alas
that
post
seemed
miles
away
and
we
believed
the
gulleys
that
intervened
between
the
two
garrisons
would
be
filled
with
indians
after
a
prolonged
season
of
this
experience
the
officer
tried
to
escape
and
go
to
his
quarters
we
were
really
so
anxious
and
alarmed
that
he
had
not
the
heart
to
resist
our
appeals
to
him
to
remain
near
and
so
that
long
day
dragged
away
about
five
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
a
faint
haze
arose
on
the
horizon
we
could
hardly
restrain
our
uneasy
feet
we
wanted
to
run
up
over
the
bluff
to
discover
what
it
meant
we
regretted
that
we
had
given
our
word
of
honor
that
we
would
not
leave
the
limits
of
the
post
soon
after
the
mules
appeared
travelling
wearily
back
through
the
same
opening
in
the
bluffs
through
which
so
many
hours
before
they
had
rushed
headlong
we
were
bitterly
disappointed
to
find
only
a
few
soldiers
driving
them
and
they
gave
but
little
news
when
the
regiment
overtook
the
stock
these
men
had
been
detailed
to
return
with
the
recaptured
animals
to
the
garrison
the
command
had
pushed
on
in
pursuit
of
the
indians
the
night
set
in
and
still
we
were
in
suspense
we
made
a
poor
attempt
to
eat
dinner
we
knew
that
none
of
the
regiment
had
taken
rations
with
them
and
several
of
the
officers
had
not
even
breakfasted
there
was
nothing
for
us
to
do
but
to
remain
together
for
the
night
from
this
miserable
frame
of
mind
we
were
thrown
into
a
new
excitement
but
fortunately
not
of
fear
we
heard
the
sound
of
the
band
ringing
out
on
the
still
evening
air
every
woman
was
instantly
on
the
piazza
from
an
entirely
different
direction
from
that
in
which
they
had
left
the
regiment
appeared
marching
to
the
familiar
notes
of
such
a
welcome
as
met
them
the
relief
from
the
anxiety
of
that
unending
day
was
inexpressible
when
the
regiment
was
nearing
the
post
the
general
had
sent
in
an
orderly
to
bring
the
band
out
to
meet
them
he
cautioned
him
to
secrecy
because
he
wished
us
to
have
a
joyous
release
from
the
suspense
he
knew
we
had
endured
the
regiment
had
ridden
twenty
miles
out
as
hard
as
the
speed
of
the
horses
would
allow
the
general
and
one
other
officer
mounted
like
himself
on
a
kentucky
found
themselves
far
in
advance
and
almost
up
to
some
of
the
indians
they
seeing
themselves
so
closely
pressed
resorted
to
the
cunning
of
their
race
to
escape
they
threw
themselves
from
their
ponies
and
plunged
into
the
underbrush
of
a
deep
ravine
where
no
horse
could
follow
the
ponies
were
captured
but
it
was
useless
to
try
any
further
pursuit
all
the
horses
were
fagged
and
the
officers
and
men
suffering
from
the
want
of
food
and
water
when
the
herders
were
questioned
next
day
it
was
found
that
the
indians
had
started
the
stampede
by
riding
suddenly
up
from
the
river
where
they
had
been
concealed
uttering
the
wildest
yells
they
each
swung
a
buffalo
robe
about
the
ears
of
the
easily
excited
mules
an
astonishing
collection
of
maimed
and
halt
appeared
the
next
morning
neither
men
nor
officers
had
been
in
the
saddle
during
the
winter
this
sudden
ride
of
so
many
miles
without
preparation
had
so
bruised
and
stiffened
their
joints
and
flesh
that
they
could
scarcely
move
naturally
when
they
sat
down
it
was
with
the
groans
of
old
men
when
they
rose
they
declared
they
would
stand
perpetually
until
they
were
again
limber
and
their
injuries
healed
as
to
the
officer
who
had
been
left
behind
he
insisted
that
their
fate
was
infinitely
preferable
to
his
we
heard
that
he
said
to
the
others
in
confidence
that
should
he
ever
be
detailed
to
command
a
garrison
where
agitated
women
were
left
he
would
protest
and
beg
for
active
duty
no
matter
if
his
life
itself
were
in
jeopardy

improvements
at
the
post
and
gardening
the
general
began
as
soon
as
the
snow
was
off
the
ground
to
improve
the
post
young
trees
the
only
variety
that
would
grow
in
that
soil
were
transplanted
from
the
river
bank
they
are
so
full
of
sap
that
i
have
seen
the
leaves
come
out
on
the
logs
that
had
been
cut
some
time
and
were
in
use
as
the
framework
of
our
this
vitality
even
when
the
roots
were
dying
deceived
us
into
building
hopes
that
all
the
trees
we
planted
would
live
we
soon
found
by
experience
however
that
it
was
not
safe
to
regard
a
few
new
leaves
as
a
sure
augury
of
the
long
life
of
these
trees
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
estimate
how
many
barrels
of
water
were
poured
around
their
roots
during
the
summer
a
few
of
them
survived
even
during
the
dry
season
and
we
watched
them
with
great
interest
one
day
my
husband
called
me
to
the
door
with
a
warning
finger
to
come
softly
he
whispered
to
me
to
observe
a
bird
perched
on
a
branch
and
trying
to
get
under
the
shade
of
two
or
three
tiny
leaflets
that
were
struggling
to
live
such
a
harbinger
of
hope
made
us
full
of
bright
anticipations
of
the
day
when
our
trees
would
cast
a
broad
shadow
no
one
who
has
not
experienced
it
can
dream
what
it
is
to
live
so
many
years
in
a
glare
as
we
did
many
of
the
officers
were
almost
blind
from
time
to
time
owing
to
the
reflection
of
the
sand
over
which
they
marched
and
with
which
they
were
surrounded
in
camp
and
garrison
i
once
asked
a
friend
who
had
crossed
the
plains
several
times
what
she
would
prefer
above
everything
else
on
the
march
when
she
replied
a
tree
i
agreed
with
her
that
nothing
else
could
have
been
such
a
blessing
my
husband
felt
that
any
amount
of
care
spent
on
the
poor
little
saplings
would
be
labor
well
bestowed
if
we
were
ordered
away
he
knew
that
others
coming
after
us
stationed
in
that
dreary
waste
would
derive
the
benefit
several
years
afterwards
i
was
assured
that
some
one
was
reaping
his
sowing
for
a
large
leaf
was
enclosed
to
me
in
an
envelope
and
a
word
added
to
explain
that
it
was
from
the
tree
in
front
of
our
quarters
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
missouri
river
except
for
the
scattered
underbrush
along
the
banks
there
was
a
stretch
of
country
for
eighty
miles
eastward
without
a
tree
and
with
hardly
a
bush
the
only
one
i
knew
of
on
our
side
of
the
river
i
could
not
help
calling
a
genuine
ancestral
tree
it
was
a
for
the
indians
we
counted
seventeen
of
them
that
were
lashed
to
boards
and
laid
across
the
main
branches
and
there
securely
fastened
so
that
a
tornado
could
not
dislodge
them
much
as
we
longed
to
enjoy
what
had
become
by
its
rarity
a
novelty
the
sitting
under
the
shade
of
green
trees
and
hearing
the
sound
of
the
wind
through
the
foliage
not
one
of
us
could
be
induced
to
tarry
under
those
sepulchral
boughs
the
struggles
to
make
the
grass
grow
on
the
sandy
were
unceasing
not
only
would
it
have
been
an
improvement
to
the
post
in
its
general
appearance
but
it
would
certainly
have
added
materially
to
our
comfort
how
we
longed
to
escape
from
the
clouds
of
dust
that
the
unceasing
wind
took
up
in
straight
whirling
eddies
and
then
wafted
in
great
sheets
of
murky
yellow
into
our
doors
and
windows
making
our
eyes
smart
and
throats
raw
and
parched
as
alkali
sand
can
do
so
effectually
the
general
sent
east
for
which
with
oats
were
sown
over
and
over
again
our
referee
on
all
agricultural
questions
assured
us
that
the
oats
sprouted
so
soon
the
oncoming
blades
of
grass
would
be
protected
he
was
so
enthusiastically
in
earnest
that
he
seemed
to
be
studying
the
soil
at
all
hours
of
the
day
to
detect
a
verdant
tinge
one
moonlight
night
we
were
attracted
to
the
gallery
by
seeing
him
stalking
slowly
back
and
forth
waving
his
arms
in
apparent
gesticulation
of
speech
as
he
traversed
the
length
of
the
some
said
in
explanation
that
the
moon
was
at
that
stage
when
reason
totters
on
her
throne
most
readily
another
declared
that
having
become
tired
of
the
career
of
a
mars
he
had
resumed
his
old
rôle
as
a
statesman
and
was
practising
addressing
his
imaginary
constituents
all
were
wrong
the
faithful
promoter
of
the
general
good
was
sowing
oats
again
doubtless
hoping
that
the
witchery
of
the
moonlight
would
be
a
potent
spell
to
induce
their
growth
even
after
such
indefatigable
efforts
the
soil
refused
to
encourage
the
sprouting
of
more
than
occasional
patches
of
pallid
green
a
portion
of
ground
near
the
river
was
assigned
the
companies
for
their
gardens
and
there
were
enough
soldiers
looking
forward
to
the
result
who
counted
it
no
hardship
to
plant
dig
and
weed
all
this
tilling
of
the
soil
inspired
our
energies
and
a
corner
of
our
own
yard
was
prepared
a
high
fence
was
put
up
so
that
the
which
make
such
incredible
leaps
could
not
scale
the
enclosure
the
household
even
gathered
about
the
general
to
see
him
drop
the
seed
so
full
of
interest
were
we
all
long
before
it
was
time
to
look
for
sprouting
we
made
daily
pilgrimages
to
the
corner
and
peered
through
the
fence
the
general
colonel
tom
and
i
watered
weeded
and
watched
the
little
bit
of
earth
the
cook
and
took
our
places
and
resumed
our
work
when
we
ceased
never
was
a
patch
of
so
guarded
and
cared
for
at
last
mary
became
impatient
and
even
turned
the
tiny
sprouts
upside
down
putting
the
plants
back
after
examining
the
roots
her
watch
was
more
vigilant
than
ours
and
she
actually
surprised
the
general
one
morning
by
putting
beside
him
a
glass
of
radishes
it
was
really
a
sensation
in
our
lives
to
have
raised
them
ourselves
and
we
could
not
help
recalling
the
pitiful
statement
of
a
dear
friend
who
also
belonged
to
a
mounted
regiment
that
she
had
planted
gardens
for
twelve
successive
springs
but
had
never
been
stationed
long
enough
in
one
place
to
reap
the
benefit
of
a
single
attempt
of
course
being
naturally
so
sanguine
as
a
family
we
began
in
imagination
almost
to
taste
the
oncoming
beets
turnips
etc
we
reckoned
too
hastily
however
for
a
perfect
army
of
grasshoppers
appeared
one
day
they
came
in
swarms
and
when
we
looked
up
at
the
sun
we
seemed
to
be
gazing
through
clouded
air
absorbed
in
this
curious
sight
we
forgot
our
precious
garden
but
colonel
tom
remembered
and
insisted
upon
trying
an
experiment
recommended
in
print
by
a
minnesota
farmer
seizing
some
tins
from
the
kitchen
and
followed
by
the
servants
and
their
mistress
all
armed
in
the
same
manner
we
adopted
the
advice
of
the
newspaper
paragraph
and
beat
the
metal
with
perfectly
deafening
noise
around
the
small
enclosure
had
grasshoppers
been
sensitive
to
sound
it
would
have
ended
in
our
triumph
as
it
was
they
went
on
peacefully
and
stubbornly
eating
every
twig
in
our
sight
having
finished
everything
they
soared
away
carrying
on
their
departing
wings
our
dreams
of
radishes
and
young
beets
the
company
gardens
were
demolished
in
the
same
manner
and
every
one
returned
for
another
year
to
the
tiresome
diet
of
canned
vegetables
i
remember
the
look
of
amazement
that
came
into
the
face
of
a
luxurious
citizen
when
i
told
him
that
we
gave
a
dinner
at
once
if
we
had
the
to
get
anything
rare
and
pray
what
did
you
call
a
rarity
he
responded
i
was
obliged
to
own
that
over
a
plebeian
cabbage
we
have
had
a
real
feast
once
in
a
great
while
one
was
reluctantly
sold
us
in
bismarck
for
a
dollar
and
a
half
we
used
condensed
milk
and
as
for
eggs
they
were
the
greatest
of
luxuries
in
the
autumn
we
brought
from
paul
several
cases
but
five
hundred
miles
of
jostling
made
great
havoc
with
them
the
were
exasperating
they
invariably
called
for
cream
and
fresh
eggs
and
made
the
cook
furious
it
seemed
to
me
that
some
officer
s
servant
on
the
frontier
must
have
given
the
receipt
for
waffles
for
it
bears
the
indefinite
tone
of
the
darky
eggs
just
as
you
haz
em
honey
a
sprinklin
of
flour
as
you
can
hold
in
your
hand
milk
well
cordin
to
what
you
the
crystallized
eggs
put
up
in
cans
and
being
airtight
kept
a
long
time
and
were
of
more
use
to
us
than
any
invention
of
the
day
in
drying
the
egg
the
yolks
and
whites
were
mixed
together
and
nothing
could
be
made
of
this
preparation
when
the
two
parts
were
required
to
be
used
separately
it
made
very
good
however
and
at
first
it
seemed
that
we
could
never
get
enough
in
the
spring
when
it
was
no
longer
safe
to
hunt
we
had
to
return
to
beef
as
we
had
no
other
kind
of
meat
my
husband
never
seemed
to
tire
of
it
however
and
suggested
to
one
of
our
friends
who
had
the
hackneyed
motto
in
his
that
she
change
it
to
give
us
this
day
our
daily
once
only
in
all
those
years
of
frontier
life
i
had
strawberries
they
were
brought
to
me
as
a
present
from
paul
the
day
they
came
there
were
as
usual
a
number
of
our
friends
on
the
piazza
i
carefully
counted
noses
first
and
hastily
went
in
before
any
one
else
should
come
to
divide
the
small
supply
into
infinitesimal
portions
i
sent
the
tray
out
by
the
maid
and
was
delayed
a
moment
before
following
her
my
husband
stepped
inside
his
face
as
pleased
as
a
child
over
the
surprise
but
at
the
same
time
his
eyes
hastily
scanning
the
buttery
shelves
for
more
berries
when
i
found
that
in
that
brief
delay
another
officer
had
come
upon
the
porch
and
that
the
general
had
given
him
his
dish
i
was
greatly
disappointed
in
vain
my
husband
assured
me
in
response
to
my
unanswerable
appeal
asking
him
why
he
had
not
kept
them
himself
that
it
was
hardly
his
idea
of
hospitality
i
was
only
conscious
of
the
fact
that
having
been
denied
them
all
these
years
he
had
after
all
lost
his
only
strawberry
feast
this
doubtless
seems
like
a
very
trifling
circumstance
to
chronicle
and
much
less
to
have
grieved
over
but
there
are
those
who
having
ventured
eight
miles
from
a
lemon
have
gained
some
faint
idea
what
temporary
deprivations
are
when
such
a
life
goes
on
year
after
year
and
one
forgets
even
the
taste
of
fruit
and
fresh
vegetables
it
becomes
an
event
when
they
appear
chapter

general
custer
s
library
the
order
came
early
in
the
season
to
rebuild
our
burned
quarters
and
the
suggestion
was
made
that
the
general
should
plan
the
interior
he
was
wholly
taken
up
with
the
arrangement
of
the
rooms
in
order
that
they
might
be
suitable
for
the
entertainment
of
the
garrison
though
he
did
not
enter
into
all
the
post
gayety
he
realized
that
ours
would
be
the
only
house
large
enough
for
the
accommodation
of
all
the
garrison
and
that
it
should
belong
to
every
one
it
was
a
pleasure
to
watch
the
progress
of
the
building
and
when
the
quartermaster
gave
the
order
for
a
to
please
me
i
was
really
grateful
the
window
not
only
broke
the
long
line
of
the
parlor
wall
but
varied
the
severe
outlines
of
the
usual
type
of
army
quarters
on

side
of
the
hall
was
the
general
s

our
room
and
the
parlor
was
opposite
and
was
feet
in
length
it
opened
with
into
the
and
still
beyond
was
the
kitchen
there
was
a
long
room
for
the
and
we
had
and
besides
to
our
delight
we
could
find
a
place
for
everybody
space
was
about
all
we
had
however
there
was
not
a
modern
improvement
the
walls
were
unpapered
and
not
even
tinted
the
windows
went
up
with
a
struggle
and
were
held
open
by
wooden
props
each
room
had
an
such
as
our
grandfathers
gathered
round
in
country
we
had
no
well
or
cistern
and
not
even
a
drain
while
the
sun
poured
in
unchecked
by
a
blind
of
even
primitive
shape
it
was
a
palace
however
compared
with
what
we
had
been
accustomed
to
in
other
stations
and
i
know
we
were
too
contented
to
give
much
thought
to
what
the
house
lacked
my
husband
was
enchanted
to
have
a
room
entirely
for
his
own
use
our
quarters
had
heretofore
been
too
small
for
him
to
have
any
privacy
in
his
work
he
was
like
a
rook
in
the
sly
manner
in
which
he
made
raids
on
the
furniture
scattered
through
the
rooms
and
carried
off
the
best
of
everything
to
enrich
his
corner
of
the
house
he
filled
it
with
the
trophies
of
the
chase
over
the
mantel
a
buffalo
s
head
plunged
seemingly
out
of
the
wall
buffaloes
were
rare
in
dakota
but
this
was
one
the
general
had
killed
from
the
only
herd
he
had
seen
on
the
campaign
the
head
of
the
first
grisly
that
he
had
shot
with
its
open
jaws
and
great
teeth
looked
fiercely
down
on
the
pretty
on
the
mantel
my
husband
greatly
valued
the
bear
s
head
and
in
writing
to
me
of
his
hunting
had
said
of
it
i
have
reached
the
height
of
a
hunter
s
fame
i
have
killed
a
several
antelope
heads
were
also
on
the
walls
one
had
a
mark
in
the
throat
where
the
general
had
shot
him
at
a
distance
of
six
hundred
yards
the
head
of
a
beautiful
deer
was
another
souvenir
of
a
hunt
the
general
had
made
with
bloody
knife
the
favorite
indian
scout
when
they
sighted
the
deer
they
agreed
to
fire
together
the
indian
selecting
the
head
the
general
taking
the
heart
they
fired
simultaneously
and
the
deer
fell
the
bullets
entering
head
and
heart
the
scout
could
not
repress
a
grunt
of
approval
as
the
indian
considers
the
white
man
greatly
his
inferior
as
a
hunter
or
a
marksman
a
crane
which
is
very
hard
to
bring
down
stood
on
a
pedestal
by
itself
a
mountain
eagle
a
yellow
fox
and
a
tiny
fox
with
a
brush
called
out
there
a
swift
were
disposed
of
in
different
corners
over
his
desk
claiming
a
perch
by
itself
on
a
pair
of
was
a
great
white
owl
on
the
floor
before
the
fireplace
where
he
carried
his
love
for
building
fires
so
far
as
to
put
on
the
logs
himself
was
spread
the
immense
skin
of
a
grisly
bear
on
a
wide
lounge
at
one
side
of
the
room
my
husband
used
to
throw
himself
down
on
the
cover
of
a
mexican
blanket
often
with
a
dog
for
his
pillow
the
had
the
skins
of
beavers
and
american
lions
thrown
over
them
a
stand
for
arms
in
one
corner
held
a
collection
of
pistols
winchester
and
springfield
rifles
and
carbines
and
even
an
old
musket
as
a
variety
from
antlers
above
hung
sabres
spurs
gloves
and
caps
the
and
the
great
compass
used
on
marches
one
of
the
sabres
was
remarkably
large
and
when
it
was
given
to
the
general
during
the
war
it
was
accompanied
by
the
remark
that
there
was
doubtless
no
other
arm
in
the
service
that
could
wield
it
my
husband
was
next
to
the
strongest
man
while
at
west
point
and
his
life
after
that
had
only
increased
his
power
the
sabre
was
a
damascus
blade
and
made
of
such
steel
that
it
could
be
bent
nearly
double
it
had
been
captured
during
the
war
and
looked
as
if
it
might
have
been
handed
down
from
some
spanish
ancestor
on
the
blade
was
engraved
a
motto
in
that
language
which
ran
do
not
draw
me
without
cause
do
not
sheathe
me
without
large
photographs
of
the
men
my
husband
loved
kept
him
company
on
the
walls
they
were
of
general
mcclellan
general
sheridan
and
lawrence
barrett
over
his
desk
was
a
picture
of
his
wife
in
bridal
dress
comparatively
modern
art
was
represented
by
two
of
the
rogers
statuettes
that
we
had
carried
about
with
us
for
years
transportation
for
necessary
household
articles
was
often
so
limited
it
was
sometimes
a
question
whether
anything
that
was
not
absolutely
needed
for
the
preservation
of
life
should
be
taken
with
us
but
our
attachment
for
those
little
figures
and
the
associations
connected
with
them
made
us
study
out
a
way
always
to
carry
them
at
the
end
of
each
journey
we
unboxed
them
ourselves
and
sifted
the
sawdust
through
our
fingers
carefully
for
the
figures
were
invariably
dismembered
my
husband
s
first
occupation
was
to
hang
the
few
pictures
and
mend
the
statuettes
he
glued
on
the
broken
portions
and
moulded
putty
in
the
crevices
where
the
biscuit
had
crumbled
sometimes
he
had
to
replace
a
bit
that
was
lost
and
as
he
was
very
fond
of
modelling
i
rather
imagined
that
he
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
practise
on
our
broken
statuettes
my
husband
like
many
other
men
who
achieve
success
in
the
graver
walks
of
life
could
go
on
and
accomplish
his
ends
without
being
dependent
on
the
immediate
voice
of
approval
in
all
the
smaller
more
trifling
acts
of
daily
life
he
asked
for
a
prompt
acknowledgment
it
amused
me
greatly
it
was
so
like
a
woman
who
can
scarcely
exist
without
encouragement
when
he
had
reset
an
arm
or
modelled
a
cap
i
could
quite
honestly
praise
his
work
on
one
occasion
we
found
the
head
of
a
figure
entirely
severed
from
the
trunk
nothing
daunted
he
fell
to
patching
it
up
again
i
had
not
the
conscience
to
promise
him
the
future
of
a
thorwaldsen
this
time
the
distorted
throat
made
of
unwieldy
putty
gave
the
formerly
erect
soldierly
neck
a
decided
appearance
of
goitre
my
laughter
discouraged
the
impromptu
artist
who
for
one
moment
felt
that
a
restoration
is
not
quite
equal
to
the
original
he
declared
that
he
would
put
a
coat
of
gray
paint
over
all
so
that
in
a
dim
corner
they
might
pass
for
new
i
insisted
that
it
should
be
a
very
dark
corner
both
of
the
statuettes
represented
scenes
from
the
war
one
was
called
wounded
to
the
rear
the
other
letter
the
latter
was
the
figure
of
a
soldier
sitting
in
a
cramped
bent
position
holding
an
inkstand
in
one
hand
and
scratching
his
head
for
thoughts
with
the
pen
the
inane
poise
of
his
chin
as
he
looked
up
into
the
uninspiring
air
and
the
hopeless
expression
of
his
eyes
as
he
searched
for
ideas
showed
how
unusual
to
him
were
all
efforts
at
composition
we
had
a
witty
friend
who
had
served
with
my
husband
during
the
war
many
an
evening
in
front
of
our
open
fire
they
fought
over
their
old
battles
together
he
used
to
look
at
the
statuette
quizzically
as
he
seated
himself
near
the
hearth
and
once
told
us
that
he
never
saw
it
without
being
reminded
of
his
own
struggles
during
the
war
to
write
to
his
wife
she
was
southern
in
sympathies
as
well
as
in
birth
but
too
absolutely
devoted
to
her
husband
to
remain
at
her
southern
home
when
he
wrote
to
her
at
the
north
where
she
was
staying
it
was
quite
to
be
understood
that
there
was
a
limit
to
topics
between
them
as
they
kept
strictly
to
subjects
that
were
foreign
to
the
vexed
question
to
the
army
in
the
field
the
thought
was
of
the
actual
occurrences
of
the
day
the
past
was
for
the
time
blotted
out
the
future
had
no
personal
plans
in
the
hearts
of
men
who
fought
as
our
heroes
did
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
the
letters
between
the
two
with
such
diversity
of
sentiment
regarding
the
contest
were
apt
to
be
short
and
solely
personal
how
the
eyes
of
that
bright
man
twinkled
when
he
said
i
used
to
look
just
like
that
man
in
the
rogers
statuette
when
i
was
racking
my
brains
to
fill
up
the
sheet
of
paper
my
orders
carried
me
constantly
through
the
country
where
my
wife
s
kin
lived
why
custer
old
man
i
could
not
write
to
her
and
say
i
have
cut
the
canal
in
the
shenandoah
valley
and
ruined
your
mother
s
plantation
or
yesterday
i
drove
off
all
your
brother
s
stock
to
feed
our
of
course
one
can
t
talk
sentiment
on
line
and
so
i
sometimes
sent
off
a
mighty
short
we
often
lounged
about
my
husband
s
room
at
dusk
without
a
lamp
the
firelight
reflected
the
large
glittering
eyes
of
the
animals
heads
and
except
that
we
were
such
a
jolly
family
the
surroundings
would
have
suggested
arenas
and
martyrs
i
used
to
think
that
a
man
on
the
brink
of
a
thrust
suddenly
into
such
a
place
in
the
dim
flickering
light
would
be
hurried
to
his
doom
by
fright
we
loved
the
place
dearly
the
great
difficulty
was
that
the
general
would
bury
himself
too
much
in
the
delight
of
having
a
castle
as
securely
barred
as
if
the
entrance
were
by
a
portcullis
when
he
had
worked
too
long
and
steadily
i
opened
the
doors
determined
that
his
room
should
not
resemble
that
of
walter
scott
an
old
engraving
represents
a
room
in
which
but
one
chair
is
significantly
placed
in
our
plans
for
a
home
in
our
old
age
we
included
a
den
for
my
husband
at
the
top
of
the
house
we
had
read
somewhere
of
one
like
that
ascribed
to
victor
hugo
the
room
was
said
not
even
to
have
a
staircase
but
was
entered
by
a
ladder
which
the
owner
could
draw
up
the
aperture
after
him
chapter
xx
the
summer
of
the
black
hills
expedition
i
used
to
be
thankful
that
ours
was
a
mounted
regiment
on
one
account
if
we
had
belonged
to
the
infantry
the
regiment
would
have
been
sent
out
much
sooner
the
horses
were
too
valuable
to
have
their
lives
endangered
by
encountering
a
blizzard
while
it
was
believed
that
an
enlisted
man
had
enough
pluck
and
endurance
to
bring
him
out
of
a
storm
in
one
way
or
another
tardy
as
the
spring
was
up
there
the
grass
began
at
last
to
be
suitable
for
grazing
and
preparations
for
an
expedition
to
the
black
hills
were
being
carried
on
i
had
found
accidentally
that
my
husband
was
fitting
up
an
ambulance
for
travelling
and
as
he
never
rode
in
one
himself
nor
arranged
to
take
one
for
his
own
comfort
i
decided
at
once
that
he
was
planning
to
take
me
with
him
mary
and
i
had
lived
in
such
close
quarters
that
she
counted
on
going
also
and
went
to
the
general
to
petition
to
keep
her
from
knowing
that
he
intended
to
take
us
he
argued
that
we
could
not
get
along
with
so
little
room
that
there
was
only
to
be
allowed
half
a
wagon
for
the
camp
outfit
of
the
mess
you
dun
know
better
n
that
giniral
she
replied
me
and
miss
libbie
could
keep
house
in
a
at
the
very
last
news
came
through
indian
scouts
that
the
summer
might
be
full
of
danger
and
my
heart
was
almost
broken
at
finding
that
the
general
did
not
dare
to
take
me
with
him
whatever
peril
might
be
awaiting
me
on
the
expedition
nothing
could
be
equal
to
the
suffering
of
suspense
at
home
the
black
hour
came
again
and
with
it
the
terrible
parting
which
seemed
a
foreshadowing
of
the
most
intense
anguish
that
our
heavenly
father
can
send
to
his
children
when
i
resumed
my
life
and
tried
to
portion
off
the
day
with
occupations
in
order
that
the
time
should
fly
faster
i
found
that
the
one
silver
thread
running
through
the
dark
woof
of
the
dragging
hours
was
the
hope
of
the
letters
we
were
promised
scouts
were
to
be
sent
back
four
times
during
the
absence
of
the
regiment
the
infantry
came
to
garrison
our
post
in
the
event
of
attack
my
husband
left
a
gatling
gun
on
the
hills
at
the
rear
of
the
camp
it
is
a
small
cannon
which
is
discharged
by
turning
a
crank
that
scatters
the
shot
in
all
directions
and
is
especially
serviceable
at
short
range
a
detachment
of
soldiers
was
stationed
on
the
bluff
back
of
us
that
commanded
the
most
extended
view
of
the
country
the
voice
of
the
sentinel
calling
at
regular
intervals
during
the
night
all
s
well
often
closed
our
anxious
eyes
out
there
one
slept
lightly
and
any
unusual
noise
was
attributed
to
an
attack
on
our
pickets
and
caused
us
many
a
wakeful
hour
with
what
relief
we
looked
up
daily
to
the
little
group
of
tents
when
we
finally
realized
that
we
were
alone
the
officer
who
commanded
this
little
station
was
an
old
bachelor
who
did
not
believe
in
marriage
in
the
army
not
knowing
this
we
told
him
with
some
enthusiasm
how
safe
and
thankful
we
felt
in
having
him
for
our
defender
he
quite
checked
our
enthusiasm
by
replying
briefly
that
in
case
of
attack
was
to
protect
government
the
defence
of
came
this
was
the
first
instance
i
had
ever
known
of
an
officer
who
did
not
believe
a
woman
was
god
s
best
gift
to
man
we
were
not
effectually
suppressed
for
the
only
safe
place
in
which
we
could
walk
was
along
the
beat
of
the
sentry
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
near
the
tent
of
this
zoological
specimen
here
we
resorted
every
evening
at
twilight
to
try
and
get
cool
for
the
sun
burns
fiercely
during
the
short
northern
summer
with
the
hot
weather
the
mosquito
war
began
fort
lincoln
was
celebrated
as
the
worst
place
in
the
united
states
for
these
pests
the
inundations
recurring
each
spring
opposite
us
brought
later
in
the
year
myriads
of
the
insects
those
i
had
known
on
the
red
river
of
the
south
were
nothing
in
comparison
if
the
wind
was
in
a
certain
direction
they
tormented
us
all
day
long
i
can
see
now
how
we
women
looked
taking
our
evening
stroll
a
little
procession
of
fluttering
females
with
scarfs
and
drawn
over
our
heads
whisking
handkerchiefs
and
beating
the
air
with
fans
it
required
constant
activity
to
keep
off
the
swarms
of
those
wretched
little
insects
that
annoyed
us
every
moment
during
our
airing
in
the
evening
we
became
almost
desperate
it
seemed
very
hard
after
our
long
winter
s
imprisonment
to
miss
a
single
hour
during
the
short
summer
we
had
petitioned
that
in
the
rebuilding
of
our
house
the
piazza
around
it
should
be
made
wide
like
those
we
enjoyed
in
the
south
on
this
delightful
gallery
we
assembled
every
evening
we
were
obliged
to
make
special
toilets
for
our
protection
and
they
were
far
from
picturesque
or
becoming
some
one
discovered
that
wrapping
newspapers
around
our
ankles
and
feet
and
drawing
the
stocking
over
would
protect
down
to
the
slipper
then
after
tucking
our
skirts
closely
around
us
we
fixed
ourselves
in
a
chair
not
daring
to
move
one
night
a
strange
officer
came
to
see
us
and
taking
his
place
among
the
group
of
women
he
tried
not
to
smile
i
discovered
him
taking
in
my
however
and
realized
myself
what
an
incongruity
i
was
on
that
lovely
gallery
and
in
the
broad
moonlight
i
had
adopted
a
they
are
little
tarlatan
bags
gathered
at
one
end
and
just
large
enough
to
slip
over
the
head
rattans
are
run
round
these
to
prevent
their
touching
the
face
they
look
like
dolls
crinolines
and
would
make
a
seraph
seem
ugly
in
desperation
i
had
added
a
waterproof
cloak
buckskin
gauntlets
and
forgot
to
hide
under
my
gown
the
tips
of
the
general
s
tucked
up
like
a
mummy
i
was
something
at
which
no
one
could
resist
laughing
the
stranger
beat
off
the
mosquitoes
until
there
lay
on
the
floor
before
him
a
black
of
those
he
had
slain
he
acknowledged
later
that
all
vanity
regarding
personal
appearance
would
be
apt
to
disappear
before
the
attacks
to
which
we
were
subjected
we
fought
in
succession
five
varieties
of
mosquitoes
the
last
that
came
were
the
most
vicious
they
were
so
small
they
slid
easily
through
the
ordinary
bar
and
we
had
to
put
an
inside
layer
of
tarlatan
on
doors
and
windows
we
did
not
venture
to
light
a
lamp
in
the
evening
and
at
five
o
clock
the
netting
was
let
down
over
the
beds
and
doors
and
windows
closed
when
it
came
time
to
retire
we
removed
our
garments
in
another
room
and
grew
skilful
in
making
sudden
sallies
into
the
and
quick
plunges
under
the
bar
the
cattle
and
horses
suffered
pitiably
during
the
reign
of
the
mosquitoes
they
used
to
push
their
way
into
the
underbrush
to
try
if
a
thicket
would
afford
them
protection
if
a
fire
were
lighted
for
their
relief
they
huddled
together
on
the
side
towards
which
the
wind
blew
the
smoke
as
it
was
down
by
the
river
they
were
worse
off
than
ever
the
cattle
grew
thin
for
there
were
days
when
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
graze
we
knew
of
their
being
driven
mad
and
dying
of
exhaustion
after
a
long
season
of
torment
the
poor
dogs
dug
deep
holes
in
the
side
of
the
hills
where
they
half
smothered
in
their
attempt
to
escape
the
missouri
river
at
the
point
where
we
had
to
cross
sometimes
represented
a
lifetime
of
terror
to
me
we
were
occasionally
compelled
to
go
to
the
town
of
bismarck
four
miles
back
on
the
other
side
i
could
not
escape
the
journey
for
it
was
the
termination
of
the
railroad
and
officers
and
their
families
coming
from
the
east
were
often
detained
there
while
waiting
for
the
steamer
to
take
them
to
their
posts
they
were
compelled
to
stay
in
the
untidy
uncomfortable
little
hotel
if
i
sent
for
them
they
declined
to
come
to
us
fearing
they
might
make
extra
trouble
if
i
went
for
them
in
the
post
ambulance
i
rarely
made
a
fruitless
errand
even
when
elated
with
the
prospect
of
a
little
outing
at
paul
i
so
dreaded
that
terrible
river
that
we
must
cross
going
and
coming
it
almost
destroyed
my
pleasure
for
a
time
the
current
was
so
swift
that
it
was
almost
impossible
for
the
strongest
swimmer
to
save
himself
if
once
he
fell
in
the
mud
settled
on
him
instantly
clogged
his
movements
and
bore
him
under
some
of
the
soldiers
had
been
drowned
in
attempting
to
cross
in
frail
insecure
skiffs
to
the
opposite
as
i
looked
into
this
roaring
torrent
whose
current
rushes
on
at
the
rate
of
six
miles
an
hour
i
rarely
failed
to
picture
to
myself
the
upturned
faces
of
these
lost
men
the
river
is
very
crooked
and
full
of
the
channel
changing
every
year
the
banks
are
so
honeycombed
by
the
force
of
the
water
that
great
portions
are
constantly
caving
in
they
used
to
fall
with
a
loud
thud
into
the
river
seeming
to
unsettle
the
very
foundations
of
the
earth
in
consequence
it
was
hard
work
for
the
to
make
a
landing
and
more
difficult
to
keep
tied
up
when
once
there
the
boat
we
were
obliged
to
use
was
owned
by
some
citizens
who
had
contracted
with
the
government
to
do
the
work
at
that
point
in
honor
of
its
new
duty
they
renamed
it
the
western
word
described
it
it
was
too
large
and
unwieldy
for
the
purpose
and
it
had
been
condemned
as
unsafe
farther
down
the
river
where
citizens
value
life
more
highly
the
wheezing
and
groaning
of
the
old
machinery
told
plainly
how
great
an
effort
it
was
to
propel
the
boat
at
all
the
road
down
to
the
plank
was
so
steep
cut
deep
into
the
bank
as
it
was
that
even
with
the
brakes
on
the
ambulance
seemed
to
be
turning
a
somersault
over
the
four
mules
they
kicked
and
struggled
and
opposed
going
on
the
boat
at
all
we
struck
suddenly
at
the
foot
of
the
incline
with
a
thump
that
threw
us
off
the
seat
of
the
ambulance
the
of
the
driver
the
creak
of
the
iron
brake
and
the
expressive
remarks
of
the
boatman
in
malediction
upon
the
mules
made
it
all
seem
like
a
descent
into
hades
and
the
river
styx
an
enviable
river
in
contrast
the
ambulance
was
placed
on
deck
where
we
could
see
the
patched
boiler
and
through
the
chinks
and
seams
of
the
furnaces
we
watched
the
fire
expecting
an
explosion
momentarily
after
we
were
once
out
in
the
channel
the
real
trouble
began
i
never
knew
when
i
started
for
bismarck
whether
we
would
not
land
at
yankton
five
hundred
miles
below
the
wheel
often
refused
to
revolve
more
than
the
boat
would
turn
about
and
we
would
shoot
down
the
river
at
a
mad
rate
i
used
to
receive
elaborate
nautical
explanations
from
the
confused
old
captain
why
that
happened
my
intellect
was
slow
to
take
in
any
other
thought
than
the
terrifying
one
that
he
had
lost
control
of
the
boat
i
never
felt
tranquil
even
when
the
difficulty
was
righted
until
i
set
my
foot
on
the
shore
though
the
ground
itself
was
insecure
from
being
honeycombed
by
the
current
the
captain
doubtless
heard
my
pæan
of
thanks
when
i
turned
my
back
on
his
old
craft
for
once
afterwards
i
received
from
him
a
crumpled
soiled
letter
with
curious
spelling
and
cramped
hand
in
which
he
addressed
me
as
highly
honored
lady
and
in
terms
proceeded
to
praise
his
boat
assuring
me
that
if
i
would
deign
to
confer
on
him
the
honor
of
my
presence
he
would
prove
it
to
be
quite
safe
and
as
peert
a
steamer
as
sailed
with
a
great
flourish
he
ended
for
must
and
shall
be
preserved
and
signed
himself
my
most
humble
admirer
we
were
told
when
the
expedition
started
that
we
might
expect
our
first
letters
in
two
weeks
the
mail
was
delayed
unfortunately
and
each
day
after
the
fortnight
had
expired
seemed
a
month
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
to
be
busy
there
was
little
heart
in
any
occupation
the
women
met
together
every
day
and
read
aloud
in
turn
every
one
set
to
work
to
make
a
present
for
the
absent
ones
with
which
to
surprise
them
on
their
return
we
played
croquet
this
was
tame
sport
however
for
no
one
dared
to
vary
the
humdrum
diversion
by
a
brisk
little
quarrel
which
is
the
usual
accompaniment
of
that
game
we
feared
to
disagree
even
over
trifles
for
if
we
did
it
might
end
in
our
losing
our
only
companionship
we
knew
that
we
could
not
expect
in
that
climate
that
the
freshness
of
summer
would
last
for
more
than
a
short
time
after
the
sun
had
come
to
its
supremest
in
the
way
of
heat
the
drouth
was
unbroken
the
dews
were
hardly
perceptible
that
year
even
our
brief
enjoyment
of
the
verdure
was
cut
short
a
sirocco
came
up
suddenly
the
sky
became
and
the
air
murky
and
stifling
the
slightest
touch
of
metal
or
even
the
almost
blistered
the
fingers
the
strong
wind
that
blew
seemed
to
shrivel
the
skin
as
it
touched
us
the
grass
was
burned
down
into
the
roots
and
we
had
no
more
of
it
that
season
this
wind
lasted
for
two
hours
and
we
could
not
keep
back
apprehensions
at
the
strange
occurrence
after
that
during
the
summer
as
we
walked
over
the
little
space
allowed
us
our
shoes
were
cut
by
the
crisp
brown
stubble
and
the
sod
was
dry
and
unyielding
under
our
feet
as
far
as
we
could
see
the
scorched
earth
sent
up
over
its
surface
floating
waves
of
heated
atmosphere
no
green
thing
was
left
the
only
flowers
that
had
not
been
scorched
out
of
existence
were
the
soap
plants
which
have
a
stalk
out
of
which
grow
the
thick
creamy
petals
of
its
flower
the
roots
that
extend
for
many
feet
in
all
directions
near
the
surface
of
the
soil
enable
it
to
secure
moisture
sufficient
to
keep
it
alive
the
only
other
flower
was
the
which
dotted
a
hill
where
we
were
accustomed
to
climb
in
order
to
command
a
better
view
of
the
country
in
our
efforts
to
discover
the
scouts
with
the
mail
one
can
scarcely
imagine
how
hungrily
we
gazed
at
those
little
blossoms
they
swung
lightly
on
their
cunningly
fashioned
stems
that
swayed
and
tossed
the
tiny
azure
cups
but
withstood
the
strongest
wind
i
can
not
see
even
a
sketch
of
that
flower
now
without
thinking
how
grateful
we
were
for
them
out
there
in
that
stripped
and
almost
land
when
we
threw
ourselves
on
the
turf
among
them
the
little
bells
almost
seemed
to
us
to
ring
out
a
tiny
sound
as
if
they
were
saying
in
flowery
cadence
the
hand
that
made
us
is
some
of
our
eyes
seemed
to
be
perpetually
strained
watching
the
horizon
for
the
scouts
at
dawn
one
morning
which
is
at
three
o
clock
in
summer
in
dakota
i
was
awakened
by
strange
sounds
at
the
door
when
i
drew
the
curtain
there
were
the
ree
scouts
and
on
their
ponies
the
marked
by
some
facetious
hand
black
hills
it
took
but
a
second
to
fling
on
a
wrapper
and
fairly
tumble
down
the
steps
the
indians
made
the
sign
of
long
hair
and
called
ouches
which
is
the
word
denoting
that
in
their
language
the
general
had
borne
this
name
with
them
for
some
time
i
was
too
impatient
to
wait
their
tardy
movements
and
tried
to
loosen
the
the
indian
always
pompous
and
important
if
he
carries
despatches
wafted
me
away
i
understood
enough
to
be
sure
that
no
one
would
receive
the
mail
but
the
officer
in
command
as
the
scouts
slowly
moved
down
the
line
towards
his
quarters
other
impatient
female
figures
with
flying
hair
came
dancing
restlessly
out
on
the
porches
every
woman
soon
knew
that
news
had
come
even
the
cooks
scantily
attired
ran
out
to
stand
beside
their
mistresses
and
wave
their
fat
arms
to
the
indians
to
hurry
them
on
our
faithful
soldier
keevan
whom
my
husband
had
left
to
care
for
us
hearing
the
commotion
came
to
ask
what
he
could
do
i
sent
him
to
bring
back
the
letters
he
in
his
turn
thinking
only
to
serve
me
made
an
effort
to
open
the
but
the
watchful
indian
suppressed
him
quickly
the
old
fellow
s
face
beamed
with
delight
when
he
placed
the
great
official
envelope
crowded
with
pages
in
my
hand
how
soon
they
were
devoured
though
and
what
a
blank
there
seemed
in
the
day
when
we
knew
that
we
had
nothing
more
to
expect
three
times
after
that
we
had
letters
they
were
most
interesting
with
descriptions
of
the
charm
of
travelling
over
ground
no
white
feet
had
ever
before
touched
my
family
could
not
avoid
even
at
that
distance
studying
up
little
plans
to
tease
me
after
describing
their
discovery
and
entrance
into
a
large
and
almost
hidden
cave
my
husband
said
that
colonel
tom
and
he
had
come
upon
the
bones
of
a
white
man
doubtless
the
only
one
who
had
ever
set
foot
in
that
portion
of
the
world
beside
him
lay
a
tin
cup
some
buttons
from
his
coat
and
a
rusty
ancient
musket
all
were
marked
with
his
initials
they
were
the
same
as
those
of
one
of
the
friends
whom
i
had
known
when
a
little
romping
girl
of
seventeen
this
they
said
in
the
language
of
a
dime
novel
explains
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
your
old
love
rather
than
meet
such
a
fate
as
awaited
him
in
marrying
you
old
lady
he
has
chosen
to
seek
out
solitude
in
a
cavern
and
there
of
course
i
thought
even
the
story
of
the
finding
of
the
cave
a
fabrication
for
my
benefit
i
enjoyed
it
hugely
and
thought
what
ingenuity
they
had
employed
to
invent
such
a
tale
when
they
came
back
at
the
end
of
the
summer
and
brought
the
musket
and
other
mementos
with
the
very
initials
rusting
in
the
metal
and
declared
on
honor
that
they
had
found
the
skeleton
i
was
compelled
to
believe
them
not
that
the
remains
of
the
unfortunate
man
were
those
of
my
early
friend
who
was
soon
afterwards
accounted
for
but
that
some
unhappy
man
had
actually
wandered
into
that
dismal
place
and
died
a
tragic
death
alone
when
the
day
of
their
return
came
i
was
simply
wild
with
joy
i
hid
behind
the
door
as
the
command
rode
into
garrison
ashamed
to
be
seen
crying
and
laughing
and
dancing
up
and
down
with
excitement
i
tried
to
remain
there
and
receive
the
general
screened
from
the
eyes
of
outsiders
it
was
impossible
i
was
down
the
steps
and
beside
my
husband
without
being
conscious
of
how
i
got
there
i
was
recalled
to
my
senses
and
overwhelmed
with
confusion
by
a
great
cheer
from
the
soldiers
who
i
had
forgotten
were
regular
soldiers
rarely
cheer
and
the
unusual
sound
together
with
the
embarrassment
into
which
i
had
unconsciously
plunged
myself
made
the
few
steps
back
to
the
house
seem
a
mile
when
we
could
take
time
to
look
every
one
over
they
were
all
amusing
enough
some
wives
did
not
know
their
husbands
and
looked
indignant
enough
when
caught
in
an
embrace
by
an
apparent
stranger
many
like
the
general
had
grown
heavy
beards
all
were
their
hair
faded
and
their
clothes
so
patched
that
the
original
blue
of
the
uniform
was
scarcely
visible
of
course
there
had
been
nothing
on
the
expedition
save
pieces
of
white
canvas
with
which
to
reinforce
the
put
new
elbows
on
sleeves
and
replace
the
worn
knees
the
boots
were
out
at
the
toes
and
the
clothing
of
some
were
so
beyond
repairing
that
the
officers
wanted
to
escape
observation
by
slipping
with
their
tattered
rags
into
the
the
instruments
of
the
band
were
jammed
and
tarnished
but
they
still
produced
enough
music
for
us
to
recognize
the
old
tune
of
garryowen
to
which
the
regiment
always
returned
the
long
appeared
many
of
the
covers
had
elk
horns
strapped
to
them
until
they
looked
like
strange
bristling
animals
as
they
drew
near
some
of
the
antlers
were
brought
to
us
as
presents
besides
them
we
had
skins
specimens
of
gold
and
mica
and
petrified
shells
of
iridescent
colors
snake
rattles
pressed
flowers
and
petrified
wood
my
husband
brought
me
a
keg
of
the
most
delicious
water
from
a
it
was
almost
my
only
look
at
clear
water
for
years
as
most
of
the
streams
west
of
the
missouri
are
muddy
as
soon
as
the
column
appeared
in
sight
the
old
soldier
who
had
served
me
with
such
fidelity
all
summer
went
to
mary
to
tell
her
the
news
he
also
said
that
as
long
as
the
general
had
put
custer
in
his
charge
he
knew
how
to
behave
now
being
no
longer
on
honor
he
added
i
intend
to
celebrate
their
return
by
going
on
a
tremendous
how
any
one
could
get
drunk
in
so
short
a
time
was
a
mystery
the
general
had
hardly
removed
his
before
the
old
fellow
stumbled
up
the
steps
and
nearly
fell
in
the
door
with
his
arms
full
of
puppies
that
had
arrived
during
the
summer
the
rejoicing
was
too
general
for
misdemeanors
to
be
noticed
the
man
was
thanked
for
his
watchful
care
over
me
during
the
months
past
and
advised
to
find
a
place
to
go
to
sleep
in
as
soon
as
possible
chapter
xxi
domestic
trials
from
the
clouds
and
gloom
of
those
summer
days
i
walked
again
into
the
broad
blaze
of
sunshine
which
my
husband
s
blithe
spirit
made
i
did
everything
i
could
to
put
out
of
my
mind
the
long
anxious
lonely
months
it
was
still
pleasant
enough
to
ride
and
occasionally
we
went
out
in
parties
large
enough
to
be
safe
and
had
a
or
wolf
chase
in
the
autumn
we
went
into
the
states
on
a
short
leave
of
absence
much
to
our
regret
we
had
to
take
our
prized
home
her
family
begged
for
her
return
the
last
to
us
was
an
appeal
from
the
young
officers
to
bring
back
another
and
we
did
so
for
while
we
were
east
we
had
the
to
persuade
another
father
and
mother
to
part
with
their
daughter
an
incident
of
our
journey
was
an
amusing
illustration
of
the
vicissitudes
of
western
life
in
passing
through
fargo
on
the
northern
pacific
railroad
an
old
townsman
of
ours
always
came
to
see
us
but
invariably
after
dark
he
had
taken
a
claim
in
the
very
heart
of
the
town
which
was
disputed
by
an
energetic
widow
if
he
left
his
place
in
the
daytime
for
a
few
hours
he
invariably
returned
to
find
his
cabin
occupied
by
the
goods
and
chattels
of
the
widow
and
his
own
effects
reposing
on
the
snow
outside
his
door
then
ensued
the
ejection
of
the
interloper
by
one
of
the
town
authorities
and
our
friend
would
himself
after
these
raids
were
repeated
a
few
times
he
learned
to
keep
guard
during
the
day
and
steal
out
after
dark
in
vain
outsiders
advised
him
to
settle
the
difficulty
by
asking
a
clergyman
to
unite
the
claims
his
eyes
turned
from
the
widow
to
a
young
girl
in
his
native
state
who
now
presides
unmolested
over
the
disputed
domicile
while
the
widow
has
forsaken
war
for
the
peace
of
another
hearthstone
the
question
of
servants
was
a
very
serious
one
to
those
living
on
the
borders
of
civilization
as
we
did
there
was
never
a
station
equal
to
those
regions
should
servants
go
out
there
in
the
fall
they
were
almost
certain
to
become
engaged
to
the
soldiers
and
marry
after
the
trains
were
taken
off
and
no
new
ones
could
reach
us
it
often
happened
that
delicate
ladies
had
to
do
all
kinds
of
menial
service
for
a
time
except
for
a
soldier
now
and
then
who
was
too
devoted
to
the
wife
of
his
company
officer
to
see
her
do
everything
i
hardly
know
how
army
ladies
would
have
endured
their
occasional
domestic
trials
the
soldiers
were
especially
fond
of
children
and
knew
how
to
amuse
them
indeed
a
willing
heart
made
them
quick
to
learn
all
kinds
of
domestic
work
i
think
they
even
regretted
that
they
could
not
sew
when
they
saw
an
overtaxed
lady
wearily
moving
her
needle
we
had
no
trouble
fortunately
our
colored
cook
not
only
commanded
us
and
as
much
of
the
post
as
she
could
but
she
tyrannized
over
her
two
sisters
whom
she
had
brought
from
kentucky
for
us
these
were
thought
excellent
servants
but
mary
invested
with
a
little
brief
authority
ruled
like
a
despot
the
youngest
having
been
born
after
the
emancipation
proclamation
was
looked
down
upon
by
her
elder
sister
who
had
been
a
slave
in
her
moments
of
rage
the
most
deadly
insult
was
to
call
the
younger
one
you
worthless
free
nigger
you
i
think
with
deep
gratitude
of
their
devotion
to
us
as
they
were
colored
people
they
had
not
even
the
excitement
of
beaux
among
the
enlisted
men
sometimes
they
sighed
and
longed
for
home
at
such
times
mary
used
to
say
to
me
miss
libbie
you
has
the
giniral
and
you
don
mind
whar
you
is
so
long
as
you
has
him
but
you
can
t
tell
what
it
is
for
us
to
live
in
a
country
wha
there
s
no
festibuls
meetin
or
when
we
reached
paul
on
our
return
from
leave
of
absence
we
were
generally
met
with
telegrams
from
our
friends
at
fort
lincoln
imploring
us
to
bring
them
cooks
the
railroad
officials
were
good
enough
to
give
us
passes
so
we
could
always
take
them
without
much
trouble
the
first
time
after
advertising
only
the
young
and
pretty
ones
were
selected
from
those
who
came
to
us
at
the
hotel
their
almost
instantaneous
capitulation
to
the
devotion
of
the
soldiers
taught
us
a
lesson
after
that
we
only
took
the
and
plain
when
we
were
fairly
started
on
our
journey
the
general
would
look
them
over
chuckle
to
himself
and
jog
my
elbow
for
me
to
see
the
ancients
as
tourists
he
would
add
under
his
breath
that
evidently
we
had
settled
the
question
that
time
for
no
soldier
would
look
at
such
antediluvians
he
reckoned
too
soon
he
hardly
took
into
consideration
that
after
hundreds
of
soldiers
had
lived
for
months
without
seeing
so
much
as
the
distant
flutter
of
a
woman
s
drapery
they
ceased
to
be
fastidious
or
critical
without
an
exception
these
antique
women
in
a
few
weeks
after
we
had
delivered
them
over
to
their
mistresses
began
to
metamorphose
they
bought
tawdry
ornaments
at
the
sutler
s
store
and
hurried
after
dinner
to
adorn
themselves
to
meet
the
enlisted
men
who
even
under
adverse
circumstances
will
i
remember
well
the
disheartened
eyes
of
one
of
our
pretty
young
friends
when
she
told
me
it
was
of
no
manner
of
use
to
try
and
keep
a
white
servant
even
the
ugly
old
female
that
we
had
brought
her
and
that
cooked
so
well
was
already
beginning
to
primp
and
powder
by
this
time
our
dearly
loved
neighbor
had
become
exhausted
by
the
almost
constant
care
of
her
two
children
and
with
only
inefficient
servants
to
help
her
through
our
sympathy
for
the
hard
life
she
led
out
in
that
wilderness
we
had
fallen
into
the
way
of
calling
her
poor
miss
annie
having
known
her
as
a
girl
in
the
states
she
would
have
been
rich
miss
with
a
brave
handsome
husband
a
distinguished
father
an
abundant
income
and
bright
healthful
children
she
rich
it
would
not
have
been
strange
if
the
clouds
had
obscured
these
blessings
living
the
taxing
wearying
life
she
did
on
the
frontier
in
vain
the
devoted
husband
sought
to
share
her
cares
the
very
climax
of
her
troubles
seemed
to
have
arrived
when
she
confided
to
me
that
she
would
soon
need
an
experienced
nurse
to
care
for
her
through
her
coming
peril
the
trains
had
ceased
running
so
that
one
could
not
be
sent
on
from
paul
there
was
no
neighborly
help
to
be
expected
even
for
all
of
our
ladies
were
young
and
inexperienced
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
to
whom
we
could
look
for
aid
instead
of
rejoicing
as
we
would
have
done
in
the
states
over
the
sweet
privilege
of
coming
maternity
we
cried
and
were
almost
disconsolate
there
were
no
soft
dainty
clothes
to
receive
the
little
stranger
no
one
to
take
care
of
it
when
it
did
come
the
young
surgeon
was
wholly
inexperienced
in
such
duty
and
the
future
looked
gloomy
enough
fortunately
i
remembered
at
last
one
of
the
camp
women
who
had
long
followed
the
regiment
as
laundress
and
had
led
a
quiet
orderly
life
poor
miss
annie
shuddered
when
i
spoke
of
her
for
the
woman
was
a
mexican
and
like
the
rest
of
that
hairy
tribe
she
had
so
coarse
and
stubborn
a
beard
that
her
chin
had
a
blue
look
after
shaving
in
marked
contrast
to
her
swarthy
face
she
was
tall
angular
awkward
and
seemingly
coarse
but
i
knew
her
to
be
in
days
gone
by
i
had
found
when
she
told
me
her
troubles
that
they
had
softened
her
nature
when
she
first
came
to
our
regiment
she
was
married
to
a
trooper
who
to
all
appearances
was
good
to
her
my
first
knowledge
of
her
was
in
kentucky
she
was
our
laundress
and
when
she
brought
the
linen
home
it
was
fluted
and
frilled
so
daintily
that
i
considered
her
a
treasure
she
always
came
at
night
and
when
i
went
out
to
pay
her
she
was
very
shy
and
kept
a
veil
pinned
about
the
lower
part
of
her
face
the
cook
told
me
one
day
that
she
was
sick
and
in
trouble
and
i
went
to
see
her
it
seemed
the
poor
thing
had
accumulated
several
hundred
dollars
by
washing
baking
pies
for
the
soldiers
and
sewing
the
clothes
for
them
that
had
been
refitted
by
the
tailor
her
husband
had
obtained
possession
of
the
money
and
had
deserted
she
told
me
that
she
had
lived
a
rough
life
before
coming
to
the
even
dressing
as
a
man
in
order
to
support
herself
by
driving
the
over
the
plains
to
new
mexico
the
railroads
had
replaced
that
mode
of
transporting
freight
and
she
was
thrown
out
of
employment
finding
the
life
as
a
laundress
easier
she
had
resumed
her
woman
s
dress
and
entered
the
army
and
thinking
to
make
her
place
more
secure
had
accepted
the
hand
of
the
man
whose
desertion
she
was
now
mourning
it
was
not
long
after
this
however
before
old
nash
for
through
everything
she
kept
her
first
husband
s
name
consoled
herself
without
going
through
the
ceremony
or
expense
of
a
divorce
she
married
another
soldier
and
had
come
with
us
out
to
dakota
of
course
her
husband
was
obliged
to
march
with
his
company
it
was
a
hard
life
for
her
camping
out
with
the
other
laundresses
as
they
are
limited
for
room
and
several
are
obliged
to
share
a
tent
together
in
the
daytime
they
ride
in
an
army
wagon
huddled
in
with
children
and
baggage
after
all
the
rough
summer
it
was
a
great
boon
to
her
to
get
a
little
cabin
in
laundress
row
at
our
post
another
trouble
came
to
her
however
her
new
husband
succeeded
in
stealing
her
savings
and
deserting
like
the
first
old
nash
mourned
her
money
a
short
time
but
soon
found
solace
in
going
to
the
soldiers
balls
dressed
in
gauzy
gowns
notwithstanding
her
architectural
build
and
massive
features
she
had
no
sooner
accumulated
another
bank
account
than
her
hand
was
solicited
for
the
third
time
again
ignoring
the
law
and
thinking
divorce
a
superfluous
luxury
she
captured
the
handsomest
soldier
in
his
company
he
was
colonel
tom
s
own
man
and
when
we
were
riding
we
often
admired
the
admirably
fitting
uniform
his
wife
had
made
over
and
which
displayed
to
advantage
his
figure
it
was
certainly
a
de
fortunes
are
comparative
a
few
hundred
dollars
out
there
was
quite
equal
to
many
thousands
in
new
york
the
trooper
thought
he
had
done
a
very
good
thing
for
himself
for
notwithstanding
his
wife
was
no
longer
young
and
was
undeniably
homely
she
could
cook
well
and
spared
him
from
eating
with
his
company
and
she
was
a
good
investment
for
she
earned
so
much
by
her
industry
in
addition
to
all
these
traits
she
was
already
that
most
desirable
creature
in
all
walks
of
life
a
woman
of
the
bride
and
groom
returned
from
the
ceremony
performed
by
the
bismarck
clergyman
and
began
in
the
little
quarters
old
nash
had
refurbished
for
the
occasion
when
miss
annie
and
i
went
down
to
see
her
and
make
our
petitions
we
found
the
little
place
shining
the
bed
was
hung
with
pink
cambric
and
on
some
shelves
she
showed
us
silk
and
woollen
stuffs
for
gowns
bits
of
carpet
were
on
the
floor
and
the
dresser
improvised
out
of
a
shone
with
polished
tins
outside
we
were
presented
to
some
chickens
which
were
riches
indeed
out
there
in
that
nova
zemblian
climate
she
was
very
gentle
with
our
friend
when
we
told
our
errand
and
gave
her
needful
advice
in
her
broken
mexican
tongue
after
listening
to
her
tribute
to
the
goodness
of
her
husband
we
made
such
pitiful
entreaties
that
we
at
last
prevailed
on
her
to
leave
him
she
insisted
upon
the
promise
that
she
might
come
home
every
evening
and
cook
her
manny
manny
s
we
learned
from
her
that
her
own
two
children
had
died
in
mexico
and
that
she
had
learned
midwifery
from
her
mother
and
confirmed
what
i
had
previously
heard
that
she
had
constant
practice
among
the
camp
women
old
nash
appeared
at
the
required
hour
and
was
as
skilful
a
physician
as
she
was
a
nurse
my
friend
used
to
whisper
to
me
that
when
she
watched
her
moving
about
in
the
dim
light
of
the
she
thought
with
a
shiver
sometimes
how
like
a
man
she
seemed
occasionally
she
came
to
the
bed
and
in
her
harsh
voice
asked
are
you
comph
meaning
comfortable
the
gentle
dexterous
manner
in
which
she
lifted
and
cared
for
the
little
woman
quieted
her
dread
of
this
great
giraffe
by
degrees
i
was
promoted
to
the
duty
of
bathing
and
dressing
the
little
the
young
mother
giving
directions
from
the
pillow
when
old
nash
was
no
longer
absolutely
necessary
she
went
back
to
her
husband
a
richer
woman
by
much
gratitude
and
a
great
deal
of
money
her
past
life
of
hardship
and
exposure
told
on
her
in
time
and
she
became
ailing
and
rheumatic
finally
after
we
had
left
dakota
we
heard
that
when
death
approached
she
made
an
appeal
to
the
camp
women
who
surrounded
her
and
had
nursed
her
through
her
illness
she
implored
them
to
put
her
in
her
coffin
just
as
she
was
when
she
died
and
bury
her
at
once
they
thinking
such
a
course
would
not
be
paying
proper
attention
to
the
dead
broke
their
promise
the
mystery
which
the
old
creature
had
guarded
for
so
many
years
through
a
life
always
public
and
conspicuous
was
revealed
old
nash
years
before
becoming
weary
of
the
laborious
life
of
a
man
had
assumed
the
disguise
of
a
woman
and
hoped
to
carry
the
secret
into
the
grave
the
surgeon
s
certificate
stating
the
sex
of
old
nash
together
with
the
simple
record
of
a
laundress
in
the
regiment
for
ten
years
was
all
the
brief
history
ever
known
after
enduring
the
gibes
and
scoffs
of
his
comrades
for
a
few
days
life
became
unbearable
to
the
handsome
soldier
who
had
played
the
part
of
husband
in
order
to
gain
possession
of
his
wife
s
savings
and
vary
the
plain
fare
of
the
soldier
with
good
suppers
he
went
into
one
of
the
company
s
stables
when
no
one
was
there
and
shot
himself
when
our
friend
whom
the
old
creature
had
so
carefully
nursed
read
the
newspaper
paragraph
describing
the
death
her
only
comment
was
a
reference
to
the
mexican
s
question
to
her
poor
old
thing
i
hope
she
is
comph
at
chapter
xxii
capture
and
escape
of
as
the
second
winter
progressed
it
bade
fair
to
be
a
repetition
of
the
first
until
an
event
happened
that
excited
us
all
very
much
i
must
preface
my
account
of
the
occurrence
by
going
back
to
the
summer
of
the
yellowstone
campaign
two
of
the
citizens
attached
to
the
expedition
one
as
the
sutler
the
other
as
the
veterinary
surgeon
were
in
the
habit
of
riding
by
themselves
a
great
deal
not
being
enlisted
men
much
more
liberty
than
soldiers
have
was
allowed
them
many
warnings
were
given
however
and
an
instance
fresh
in
the
minds
of
the
officers
of
the
killing
by
indians
of
two
of
their
comrades
the
year
before
was
repeatedly
told
to
them
one
day
their
last
hour
of
lingering
came
while
they
stopped
to
water
their
horses
some
indians
concealed
in
a
gully
shot
them
within
sight
of
our
regiment
who
were
then
fighting
on
the
hill
and
did
not
find
the
bodies
for
some
time
afterwards
both
of
the
murdered
men
were
favorites
both
left
families
and
regret
and
sympathy
were
general
throughout
the
command
a
year
and
a
half
afterwards
information
came
to
our
post
fort
lincoln
that
an
indian
was
then
at
the
agency
at
standing
rock
drawing
his
rations
blankets
and
ammunition
from
the
government
and
at
the
same
time
boasting
of
the
murder
of
these
two
men
this
intelligence
created
intense
indignation
in
our
garrison
a
detachment
was
quickly
prepared
and
started
out
with
sealed
orders
the
day
was
bitter
and
not
a
still
cold
for
the
wind
blew
and
cut
like
into
the
faces
of
the
troopers
no
one
was
aware
even
what
direction
they
were
to
take
general
custer
knew
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
caution
and
secrecy
should
be
observed
at
the
next
post
twenty
miles
below
there
were
scouts
employed
they
would
not
fail
to
send
out
a
runner
and
warn
the
standing
rock
indians
of
the
coming
of
the
command
and
its
object
if
they
could
learn
what
it
was
when
the
runner
carries
important
news
he
starts
with
an
even
gait
in
the
morning
and
keeps
it
up
all
day
hardly
stopping
to
drink
at
the
streams
he
crosses
such
a
courier
would
outstrip
a
command
of
cavalry
in
the
ordinary
time
it
makes
on
a
march
accordingly
fort
rice
was
left
behind
many
miles
before
the
orders
were
opened
they
contained
directions
to
capture
and
bring
back
an
uncapapa
indian
called
the
avowed
murderer
of
the
sutler
and
the
veterinary
surgeon
the
command
contested
of
two
officers
and
a
hundred
men
the
general
had
selected
his
brother
to
assist
in
this
delicate
transaction
as
he
had
been
wont
to
do
ever
since
they
began
their
life
of
adventure
together
during
the
war
they
arrived
on
the
day
that
the
indians
were
drawing
their
rations
of
beef
there
were
five
hundred
at
the
agency
armed
with
the
latest
rifles
it
was
more
and
more
clear
that
too
much
care
could
not
be
taken
to
prevent
the
object
of
the
visit
being
known
to
the
warriors
an
expedition
had
been
sent
down
once
before
but
news
of
its
intentions
had
reached
the
agency
in
time
for
the
culprit
to
escape
he
could
not
refrain
even
after
this
warning
from
openly
vaunting
his
crime
in
order
then
to
deceive
as
to
the
purport
of
their
appearance
at
the
agency
the
captain
in
command
resorted
to
a
ruse
he
sent
fifty
men
to
the
camp
ten
miles
away
to
make
inquiries
for
three
indians
who
had
murdered
citizens
on
the
red
river
the
year
before
colonel
custer
was
ordered
to
take
five
picked
men
and
go
to
the
trader
s
store
where
the
indians
resort
constantly
this
required
great
coolness
and
extreme
patience
for
they
had
to
lounge
about
seemingly
indifferent
until
they
could
be
certain
the
right
man
was
discovered
the
cold
made
the
indians
draw
their
blankets
around
them
and
over
their
heads
there
is
never
any
individuality
about
their
dress
unless
when
arrayed
for
a
council
or
a
dance
it
was
therefore
almost
impossible
to
tell
one
from
the
other
colonel
tom
had
to
wait
for
hours
only
looking
furtively
when
the
sharp
eyes
of
these
wary
creatures
were
off
guard
at
last
one
of
them
loosened
his
blanket
and
with
the
meagre
description
that
had
been
given
him
colonel
tom
identified
him
as
coming
suddenly
from
behind
he
threw
his
arms
about
him
and
seized
the
winchester
rifle
that
the
savage
attempted
to
cock
he
was
taken
entirely
by
surprise
no
fear
showed
itself
but
from
the
characteristically
stolid
face
hate
and
revenge
flashed
out
for
an
instant
he
drew
himself
up
in
an
independent
manner
to
show
his
brother
warriors
that
he
did
not
dread
death
among
them
he
had
been
considered
brave
beyond
precedent
because
he
had
dared
to
enter
the
agency
store
at
all
and
so
encounter
the
risk
of
arrest
the
soldiers
tied
his
hands
and
mounted
guard
over
him
about
thirty
indians
surrounded
them
instantly
and
one
old
orator
commenced
an
harangue
to
the
others
inciting
them
to
recapture
their
brother
breathless
excitement
prevailed
at
that
moment
the
captain
in
command
appeared
in
their
midst
with
the
same
coolness
he
had
shown
in
the
war
and
during
the
six
years
of
his
indian
campaigns
he
spoke
to
them
through
an
interpreter
with
prudence
and
tact
he
explained
that
they
intended
to
give
the
prisoner
exactly
the
treatment
a
white
man
would
receive
under
like
circumstances
that
nothing
would
induce
them
to
give
him
up
and
the
better
plan
to
save
bloodshed
would
be
for
the
chiefs
to
withdraw
and
take
with
them
their
followers
seeing
that
they
could
accomplish
nothing
by
intimidation
or
by
superior
numbers
they
had
recourse
to
parley
and
proposed
to
compromise
they
offered
as
a
sacrifice
two
indians
of
the
tribe
in
exchange
for
it
was
generosity
like
that
of
artemus
ward
who
offered
his
wife
s
relatives
on
the
altar
of
his
country
for
they
took
care
not
to
offer
for
sacrifice
any
but
indians
of
low
rank
was
a
very
distinguished
warrior
among
them
and
belonged
to
a
family
of
six
brothers
one
of
whom
iron
horse
was
very
influential
the
officers
prevailed
in
the
end
and
the
prisoner
was
taken
to
the
cavalry
camp
during
the
time
that
the
indians
were
opposing
his
removal
the
troopers
had
assembled
around
the
entrance
ready
for
any
emergency
and
prepared
to
escort
the
murderer
away
the
indians
instantly
vanished
all
went
quickly
and
quietly
to
their
camp
ten
miles
distant
later
in
the
day
a
party
of
fifty
mounted
warriors
dashed
through
the
agency
to
the
road
beyond
which
had
to
be
taken
by
our
troopers
on
the
way
home
of
course
our
officers
expected
an
attack
from
that
party
when
they
began
their
homeward
march
to
their
surprise
they
were
unmolested
we
learned
afterwards
that
the
mounted
indians
went
to
the
camp
of
two
bears
to
urge
the
young
braves
there
to
combine
with
them
in
the
recapture
of
two
bears
had
long
been
friendly
to
the
white
man
he
was
too
old
to
fight
and
prevented
his
young
men
from
joining
in
the
contemplated
rescue
after
the
command
had
returned
and
the
officers
had
reported
general
custer
sent
for
he
was
tall
straight
and
young
his
face
was
quite
imperturbable
in
a
subsequent
interview
the
general
locked
himself
in
his
room
with
him
through
an
interpreter
and
with
every
clever
question
and
infinite
patience
he
spent
hours
trying
to
induce
the
indian
to
acknowledge
his
crime
the
culprit
s
face
finally
lost
its
impervious
look
and
he
showed
some
agitation
he
gave
a
brief
account
of
the
murder
and
the
next
day
made
a
full
confession
before
all
the
officers
he
said
neither
of
the
white
men
was
armed
when
attacked
he
had
shot
the
old
man
but
he
did
not
die
instantly
riding
a
short
distance
before
falling
from
his
horse
he
then
went
to
him
and
with
his
stone
mallet
beat
out
the
last
breath
left
before
leaving
him
he
shot
his
body
full
of
arrows
the
younger
man
signalled
to
them
from
among
the
bushes
and
they
knew
that
the
manner
in
which
he
held
up
his
hand
was
an
overture
of
peace
when
he
reached
him
the
white
man
gave
him
his
hat
as
another
and
further
petition
for
mercy
but
he
shot
him
at
once
first
with
his
gun
and
then
with
arrows
one
of
the
latter
entering
his
back
the
dying
man
struggled
to
pull
it
through
neither
man
was
scalped
as
the
elder
was
bald
and
the
younger
had
closely
cropped
hair
this
cruel
story
set
the
blood
of
the
officers
flowing
hotly
they
had
already
heard
from
one
of
the
white
scouts
a
description
of
at
a
when
he
had
betrayed
himself
as
the
murderer
of
the
veterinary
surgeon
by
describing
in
triumph
his
beating
out
the
brains
of
the
old
man
with
his
mallet
after
all
this
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
each
officer
strode
out
of
the
room
with
blazing
eyes
two
indians
one
of
them
iron
horse
had
followed
the
cavalry
up
from
the
agency
and
asked
to
see
their
comrade
the
general
sent
again
for
he
came
into
the
room
with
clanking
chains
and
with
the
guard
at
his
heels
he
was
dressed
in
mourning
his
leggings
were
black
and
his
sable
blanket
was
belted
by
a
band
of
white
beads
one
black
feather
stood
erect
on
his
head
iron
horse
supposed
that
he
was
to
be
hung
at
once
and
that
this
would
be
the
final
interview
the
elder
brother
believing
there
was
no
hope
was
very
solemn
he
removed
his
and
embroidered
buffalo
robe
and
replaced
it
with
the
plain
one
that
wore
he
exchanged
pipes
also
giving
him
his
one
that
he
might
afterwards
present
it
to
the
general
these
pipes
are
valuable
as
the
material
of
which
the
bowls
are
made
has
to
be
brought
from
kansas
then
finding
that
there
was
a
prospect
of
having
his
trial
in
washington
he
took
off
the
medal
that
had
been
given
to
his
father
by
a
former
president
whose
likeness
was
in
the
medallion
and
placed
it
over
the
neck
of
his
brother
that
it
might
be
a
silent
argument
in
his
favor
when
he
confronted
the
great
it
was
an
impressive
and
melancholy
scene
iron
horse
charged
his
brother
not
to
attempt
to
escape
saying
that
if
he
did
get
back
to
the
reservation
he
would
surely
be
recaptured
he
believed
that
he
would
be
kindly
treated
while
a
captive
and
perhaps
the
white
chief
would
intercede
for
him
to
obtain
his
pardon
after
asking
him
not
to
lose
courage
they
smoked
again
and
silently
withdrew
in
about
ten
days
iron
horse
returned
bringing
a
portion
of
his
tribe
with
him
the
valley
of
the
missouri
is
wide
and
slopes
gradually
back
to
the
bluffs
beyond
are
the
plains
rolling
away
for
hundreds
of
miles
to
another
river
there
was
a
level
stretch
of
three
miles
below
our
post
down
the
river
from
this
direction
we
were
accustomed
to
watch
the
approach
of
the
bands
of
indians
coming
from
the
reservation
we
could
see
their
arms
glistening
far
down
the
valley
long
before
we
could
distinguish
who
they
were
except
with
a
powerful
as
they
came
nearer
the
sun
caught
a
bit
of
gaudy
scarlet
or
touched
for
a
moment
one
of
the
feathers
in
a
a
new
york
charity
ball
could
bring
out
no
more
antique
heirlooms
nor
take
more
time
in
preparations
than
the
costumes
of
indians
prepared
for
council
the
shields
and
necklaces
of
bear
s
claws
are
all
handed
down
from
grandfathers
and
only
aired
on
grand
occasions
every
available
bit
of
metal
that
could
catch
the
light
reflected
and
shone
in
the
morning
sun
the
belts
were
covered
with
brass
nails
shining
with
many
an
hour
s
polishing
they
had
many
weapons
all
kept
in
a
brilliant
and
glistening
state
the
tomahawk
is
one
of
the
heirlooms
of
the
collection
of
arms
it
is
not
like
the
ones
i
used
to
see
at
mackinac
as
a
child
it
looks
more
like
a
large
the
knife
pistol
and
henry
rifle
are
very
modern
and
are
always
kept
in
the
most
perfect
condition
lo
is
the
venus
who
prepares
mars
for
war
and
many
a
long
weary
hour
she
spends
in
polishing
the
weapon
and
adorning
the
warrior
the
indians
with
iron
horse
came
directly
to
and
asked
for
a
council
as
many
as
could
get
into
the
general
s
room
entered
there
was
time
while
they
were
preparing
to
send
for
the
ladies
and
a
few
of
us
were
tucked
away
on
the
lounge
with
injunctions
not
to
move
or
whisper
for
my
husband
treated
these
indians
with
as
much
consideration
as
if
they
had
been
crowned
heads
the
indians
turned
a
surprised
rather
scornful
glance
into
the
ladies
gallery
for
their
women
are
always
kept
in
the
background
in
return
for
this
we
did
not
hesitate
to
criticise
their
toilets
they
were
gorgeous
in
full
dress
iron
horse
wore
an
elaborately
beaded
and
painted
buckskin
shirt
with
masses
of
solid
embroidery
of
porcupine
quills
the
sleeves
and
shoulders
were
ornamented
with
a
fringe
of
some
of
the
hair
we
saw
with
a
shudder
was
light
and
waving
i
could
not
but
picture
the
little
head
sunning
over
with
curls
from
which
it
had
been
taken
for
all
the
indian
locks
i
have
ever
seen
were
straight
and
black
the
chief
wore
on
his
shoulders
a
sort
of
cape
trimmed
with
a
fringe
of
snowy
ermine
his
leggings
and
moccasins
were
a
mass
of
he
wore
a
cap
of
otter
without
a
crown
though
for
it
is
their
custom
to
leave
the
top
of
the
head
uncovered
his
hair
was
wound
round
and
round
with
strips
of
otter
that
hung
down
his
back
the
was
also
tightly
wound
three
eagle
feathers
that
denote
the
number
of
warriors
killed
were
so
fastened
to
the
lock
that
they
stood
erect
there
were
several
perforations
in
each
ear
from
which
depended
bead
he
had
armlets
of
burnished
brass
thrown
around
him
was
a
beaded
blanket
the
red
clay
pipe
had
the
wooden
stem
inlaid
with
silver
and
was
embellished
with
the
breast
feathers
of
brilliantly
plumaged
birds
the
about
two
feet
long
had
not
an
inch
that
was
not
decorated
the
costume
was
simply
superb
the
next
in
rank
had
an
immense
buffalo
robe
as
the
distinguishing
feature
of
his
dress
the
inside
was
tanned
almost
white
and
his
history
was
painted
on
the
surface
whoever
ran
might
read
for
it
represented
only
two
scenes
oft
repeated
the
killing
and
scalping
of
warriors
and
the
capture
of
ponies
the
general
s
patience
with
indians
always
surprised
me
he
was
of
such
an
active
temperament
and
despatched
his
own
work
so
rapidly
that
i
have
often
wondered
how
he
contained
himself
waiting
an
hour
or
more
for
them
to
get
at
the
object
of
their
visit
they
took
their
places
according
to
rank
in
a
semicircle
about
the
general
the
pipe
was
filled
and
a
match
lighted
by
one
of
their
number
of
inferior
grade
and
then
handed
to
iron
horse
who
took
a
few
leisurely
whiffs
though
we
were
so
shut
in
the
smoke
was
not
oppressive
their
tobacco
is
killikinick
prepared
by
drying
the
bark
of
the
ozier
and
mixing
it
with
sumach
they
inhale
the
smoke
and
exhale
it
from
their
nostrils
after
all
in
the
first
circle
had
smoked
a
little
the
general
included
they
observed
the
indian
etiquette
and
passed
the
pipe
back
through
each
warrior
s
hand
to
the
chief
it
was
then
relighted
and
he
began
again
it
seemed
to
us
that
it
went
back
and
forth
an
endless
number
of
times
no
matter
how
pressing
the
emergency
every
council
begins
in
this
manner
iron
horse
tired
us
out
but
he
was
collecting
himself
and
rehearsing
his
speech
we
found
afterwards
that
it
was
prepared
in
advance
for
during
its
recital
he
forgot
and
was
prompted
by
one
of
the
indians
in
the
outer
circle
when
the
pipe
was
finally
put
away
they
asked
to
have
present
he
came
into
the
room
trying
to
hide
his
pleasure
at
seeing
his
friends
and
his
grief
at
his
imprisonment
in
an
instant
the
imperturbable
expression
settled
down
on
his
face
like
a
curtain
the
officers
present
could
scarcely
believe
their
eyes
when
they
saw
his
brother
approach
and
kiss
him
only
once
before
among
all
the
tribes
they
had
been
with
had
they
seen
such
an
occurrence
the
indian
kiss
is
not
demonstrative
the
lips
are
laid
softly
on
the
cheek
and
no
sound
is
heard
or
motion
made
it
was
only
this
grave
occasion
that
induced
the
chief
to
show
such
feeling
several
of
the
ranking
indians
followed
his
example
then
an
old
man
among
them
stepped
in
front
of
lifted
his
hands
and
raising
his
eyes
reverentially
said
a
few
words
of
prayer
to
the
great
spirit
in
behalf
of
their
unfortunate
brother
the
prisoner
dropped
his
head
to
hide
the
look
in
his
eyes
that
he
thought
ill
became
a
warrior
as
brave
as
he
really
was
the
bitter
revengeful
thoughts
with
which
i
had
entered
the
room
were
for
a
moment
forgotten
and
i
almost
wished
that
he
might
be
pardoned
the
vision
of
the
he
had
desolated
came
back
to
me
directly
and
i
could
not
forget
iron
horse
began
his
speech
in
the
usual
unchangeable
key
he
thanked
the
general
for
his
care
of
his
brother
and
the
whole
tenor
of
the
rest
was
repeated
petitions
to
ask
the
great
father
in
washington
to
spare
his
life
he
then
slowly
took
off
his
elaborate
buckskin
shirt
and
presented
it
to
my
husband
he
ended
by
making
a
singular
request
which
was
worthy
of

of
the

permission
through
their
chief
to
share
the
captivity
of
i
could
not
help
recalling
what
some
one
had
told
me
in
the
east
that
women
sometimes
go
to
the
state
prison
at
sing
sing
and
importune
to
be
allowed
to
share
the
imprisonment
of
their
husbands
or
brothers
but
no
instance
is
found
in
the
history
of
that
great
institution
where
a
man
has
asked
to
divide
with
a
friend
or
relative
the
sufferings
of
his
sentence
consent
was
given
to
the
comrades
to
return
to
the
but
they
were
required
to
remain
in
confinement
as
he
did
until
they
were
ready
to
return
to
the
reservation
after
all
the
ranking
indians
had
followed
iron
horse
in
speeches
with
long
maundering
sentences
each
like
the
other
the
pipe
was
again
produced
when
it
was
smoked
the
whole
band
filed
out
to
eat
the
presents
of
food
the
general
had
given
them
and
soon
afterwards
disappeared
down
the
valley
on
their
way
home
after
his
two
friends
had
left
him
occupied
a
part
of
the
with
a
citizen
who
had
been
caught
stealing
grain
from
the
storehouse
for
several
months
they
had
been
chained
together
and
used
to
walk
in
front
of
the
little
prison
for
exercise
and
air
the
was
a
insecure
wooden
building
after
a
time
the
sentinels
became
less
vigilant
and
the
citizen
with
help
from
his
friends
outside
who
were
working
in
the
same
way
cut
a
hole
in
the
wall
at
night
and
escaped
he
broke
the
chain
attaching
him
to
the
indian
who
was
left
free
to
follow
we
found
afterwards
that
did
not
dare
to
return
to
the
reservation
but
made
his
way
to
the
hostile
camp
in
the
spring
of
he
sent
word
from
there
by
an
agency
indian
that
he
had
joined
sitting
bull
and
was
awaiting
his
revenge
for
his
imprisonment
as
will
be
seen
further
on
the
stained
waters
of
the
little
big
horn
on
june
told
how
deadly
and
fatal
that
was
the
vengeance
of
that
incarnate
fiend
was
concentrated
on
the
man
who
had
effected
his
capture
it
was
found
on
the
that
he
had
cut
out

brave
heart
of
that
gallant
loyal
and
lovable
man

garrison
amusements
the
second
winter
at
fort
lincoln
was
very
much
the
same
as
the
first
we
had
rented
a
piano
at
paul
in
the
autumn
it
hardly
had
a
respite
from
morning
until
late
at
night
every
day
and
evening
the
sound
of
happy
voices
went
through
the
house
old
college
choruses
and
negro
melodies
that
every
one
knew
were
sung
and
on
sunday
our
only
most
of
the
time
was
to
meet
together
and
sing
hymns
in
our
little
circle
of
forty
many
denominations
were
represented
but
all
knew
the
hymns
the
moody
and
sankey
book
had
soon
found
its
way
out
there
and
incited
every
one
that
could
raise
a
note
to
make
the
attempt
we
had
forgotten
to
bring
a
tuner
for
the
piano
but
the
blacksmith
made
a
very
good
one
one
of
the
band
who
had
been
in
a
before
enlisting
kept
the
instrument
in
order
we
had
hard
work
to
keep
it
in
tune
for
not
only
did
the
extreme
cold
affect
the
sound
but
it
had
to
endure
the
constant
drumming
of
untaught
fingers
even
my
husband
who
was
not
nervous
used
sometimes
to
beg
colonel
tom
to
stop
feeling
about
for
that
tune
the
general
loved
music
and
had
so
correct
an
ear
that
he
often
sang
or
whistled
the
airs
of
an
opera
after
hearing
them
once
music
so
charmed
him
that
when
we
have
been
in
the
states
listening
to
an
oratorio
the
thomas
orchestra
or
a
recital
of
any
kind
he
has
begged
me
not
to
be
hurt
if
he
did
not
speak
during
the
rendering
there
was
a
swiss
soldier
in
our
regiment
who
had
contrived
to
bring
his
zither
with
him
my
husband
would
lie
on
the
rug
in
front
of
the
fire
and
listen
with
delight
as
long
as
he
ventured
to
tax
the
man
he
played
the
native
tyrolese
airs
which
seemed
to
have
caught
in
them
the
sound
of
the
alpine
horn
the
melody
of
the
cascade
and
the
echo
of
the
mountain
passes
the
general
often
regretted
that
he
had
not
had
the
opportunity
to
learn
music
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
a
great
solace
and
diversion
to
officers
if
they
knew
some
musical
instrument
well
enough
to
enjoy
practice
they
certainly
gave
great
pleasure
to
those
around
them
if
the
ladies
had
any
accomplishment
that
gave
gratification
to
others
it
was
never
allowed
to
grow
rusty
of
course
where
there
was
so
little
to
interest
whatever
they
did
was
overrated
sometimes
we
heard
of
one
of
the
officers
of
the
matching
the
perfections
of
our
ladies
against
those
of
another
regiment
which
he
might
happen
to
be
visiting
his
de
carried
him
so
far
that
he
would
insist
that
no
women
sang
played
danced
painted
or
rode
as
we
did
we
could
only
hope
that
we
would
never
see
the
people
to
whom
he
had
boasted
and
so
awaken
them
from
his
overdrawn
story
to
the
reality
i
used
to
pity
the
officers
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
because
of
the
tameness
and
dead
calm
of
their
lives
in
winter
each
year
s
service
with
them
made
me
wonder
more
and
more
how
they
could
come
through
the
test
of
so
much
unemployed
time
the
really
fine
men
they
were
watts
spoke
lines
that
will
do
for
all
time
when
he
told
us
who
it
was
that
found
mischief
for
idle
hands
we
had
no
good
company
libraries
like
the
infantry
because
we
had
so
long
been
without
a
place
to
call
our
own
every
officer
coming
from
leave
brought
what
books
he
could
and
they
went
the
rounds
until
the
worn
leaves
would
hardly
hold
together
we
women
had
many
a
simple
occupation
that
interested
us
but
the
men
could
not
content
themselves
with
trifles
if
the
young
ladies
and
i
stole
away
to
try
to
take
a
nap
or
change
our
dress
we
were
almost
invariably
called
back
by
the
lonely
men
who
wished
to
be
amused
they
were
certainly
so
grateful
for
the
slightest
kindness
it
was
no
tax
besides
people
can
not
go
up
and
down
the
face
of
the
earth
together
for
nine
years
of
hardships
trials
and
deprivation
without
being
as
nearly
like
one
family
as
is
possible
i
used
to
dread
the
arrival
of
the
young
officers
who
came
to
the
regiment
from
west
point
fearing
that
the
sameness
and
inactivity
of
the
garrison
life
would
be
a
test
to
which
their
character
would
succumb
when
they
came
to
pay
the
first
ceremonious
call
in
full
uniform
we
spoke
of
commonplace
topics
i
kept
up
a
running
line
of
comments
to
myself
usually
on
one
subject
i
wonder
if
you
are
likely
to
go
to
the
bad
under
temptation
i
am
sorry
for
your
mother
having
to
give
you
up
and
be
anxious
for
your
habits
at
the
same
time
i
hope
you
don
t
drink
i
pray
that
you
may
have
stamina
enough
to
resist
our
sister
knew
that
i
believed
so
in
matrimony
as
a
savior
of
young
officers
that
she
used
to
teasingly
accuse
me
of
greeting
all
of
them
when
they
arrived
with
the
same
welcome
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
i
hope
that
you
are
i
hardly
remember
being
quite
so
abrupt
as
that
in
speaking
but
i
never
failed
to
wish
it
to
myself
their
frequent
difficulty
was
that
they
desired
to
do
everything
that
the
old
officers
did
i
have
known
them
rub
and
try
to
mar
their
shining
new
uniforms
to
have
them
look
as
if
they
had
seen
service
one
especially
youthful
in
appearance
wondered
how
i
came
to
divine
that
the
reason
he
wore
his
grandfather
s
fob
and
seal
and
carried
the
cane
when
off
duty
was
that
he
wished
to
look
old
and
experienced
i
could
not
help
praising
them
when
they
went
through
the
first
few
telling
years
of
service
and
came
off
conquerors
i
was
sure
that
had
i
had
the
misfortune
to
be
a
man
i
could
not
have
borne
the
tests
to
which
i
knew
they
were
subjected
i
am
sure
that
we
could
not
have
been
so
contented
as
we
were
under
such
circumstances
had
there
not
been
such
perfect
health
among
us
all
it
was
a
pleasure
to
live
among
so
many
hundred
people
and
scarcely
see
any
one
who
was
not
perfectly
well
another
relief
in
that
life
was
that
we
never
saw
crippled
or
maimed
people
and
there
were
no
suffering
poor
we
found
our
new
quarters
admirable
for
the
garrison
gayety
on
friday
nights
we
all
gathered
together
to
dance
or
have
private
theatricals
or
games
during
the
early
part
of
the
winter
while
the
supply
of
eggs
we
had
brought
from
paul
lasted
mary
used
to
give
us
cake
frozen
custard
or
some
luxury
of
which
these
formed
a
part
this
in
addition
to
the
usual
coffee
and
venison
made
our
refreshments
as
winter
advanced
and
the
supplies
began
to
give
out
we
had
to
be
content
with
crullers
coffee
and
sandwiches
there
was
very
little
spirit
of
criticism
and
in
that
climate
one
is
always
hungry
of
course
every
one
relied
on
cards
as
the
unfailing
amusement
almost
without
exception
they
played
well
and
with
great
enthusiasm
every
one
struggled
over
me
and
i
really
worked
faithfully
to
become
an
adept
for
though
i
did
not
enjoy
it
ever
it
seemed
very
ungracious
in
me
not
to
be
able
to
take
a
hand
when
i
was
needed
there
must
have
been
something
lacking
in
my
mental
organization
for
i
could
not
learn
i
had
one
friend
who
was
equally
stupid
he
certainly
was
a
comfort
to
me
we
became
perfectly
hardened
to
the
gibes
of
our
friends
when
they
called
to
him
come
smith
and
try
this
new
game
it
is
easy
why
even
custer
learned
it
i
labored
on
until
at
the
end
of
twelve
years
of
effort
i
trumped
my
partner
s
ace
and
was
formally
excused
from
ever
trying
again
a
party
was
always
amusing
out
there
for
it
was
necessary
to
exercise
great
ingenuity
in
getting
up
costumes
we
were
masked
carefully
and
often
the
dress
was
such
a
complete
disguise
that
a
husband
and
wife
were
kept
in
ignorance
of
each
other
until
the
signal
for
unmasking
was
given
at
supper
it
was
impossible
to
conceal
our
eccentricities
living
in
such
close
daily
association
as
there
was
continual
chaffing
and
innumerable
practical
jokes
it
was
difficult
to
know
at
what
moment
one
s
peculiarities
were
to
be
served
up
for
the
amusement
of
others
at
all
events
when
one
s
personal
traits
and
singularities
were
openly
joked
about
it
was
something
of
a
consolation
to
know
that
the
worst
to
be
said
was
directed
to
the
face
and
not
behind
the
back
as
is
the
general
rule
there
was
one
of
our
number
towards
whom
we
could
not
fire
the
shot
and
shell
of
ridicule
he
was
far
older
than
any
one
at
the
post
and
there
was
too
much
reverence
for
his
hoary
head
to
permit
extreme
raillery
i
confess
to
laughing
over
some
of
his
strange
aberrations
when
his
young
lieutenant
gave
us
an
imitation
of
their
company
drill
the
old
officer
mounted
on
a
horse
as
toned
down
as
himself
stood
in
front
of
his
troops
and
addressed
them
as
he
would
have
done
his
supporters
in
the
old
political
days
they
appreciated
the
stump
eloquence
but
more
keenly
the
fact
that
while
he
talked
they
would
escape
the
tedious
evolutions
of
their
work
sometimes
while
going
through
the
directions
of
the
tactics
the
captain
lost
his
suavity
and
called
a
halt
then
with
all
the
inflections
and
emphasis
placed
as
carefully
as
if
he
were
flinging
the
constitution
at
a
crowd
of
citizens
on
the
of
july
he
harangued
in
slightly
heated
tones
men
do
you
suppose
you
are
men
if
so
act
like
men
if
you
are
geese
act
like
this
would
finish
the
of
even
the
oldest
soldier
and
a
great
guffaw
would
burst
out
for
nothing
can
be
more
ridiculous
than
a
regular
officer
pausing
to
address
his
men
in
such
a
place
the
drill
is
conducted
usually
without
another
word
than
a
repetition
of
the
exact
language
of
the
book
of
tactics
the
young
lieutenant
in
his
position
at
the
rear
would
nearly
choke
with
laughter
he
told
us
how
he
rode
along
the
line
and
prodded
the
soldiers
in
the
back
without
the
captain
seeing
him
to
try
and
make
them
more
deferential
his
short
burlesque
repetitions
of
the
aphorisms
philosophy
and
theories
on
all
subjects
that
the
old
captain
delivered
daily
on
the
were
convulsing
if
the
speeches
themselves
were
half
as
funny
as
the
imitations
the
men
would
have
been
stolidity
itself
if
they
had
not
forgotten
their
discipline
and
laughed
my
husband
was
truly
attached
to
this
officer
and
spared
him
from
hardships
and
trying
campaigns
when
he
could
in
a
measure
he
felt
himself
responsible
for
the
incongruous
position
the
elderly
man
occupied
in
a
cavalry
regiment
full
of
young
active
men
after
the
war
when
the
old
officer
was
mustered
out
of
the
volunteer
service
he
found
that
in
his
native
state
the
waves
had
closed
over
him
and
his
place
was
lost
in
public
life
the
general
went
personally
to
the
war
department
and
solicited
an
appointment
for
him
in
the
regular
army
some
time
after
he
was
surprised
to
find
him
assigned
to
his
own
regiment
doubtless
because
a
personal
application
gave
the
impression
that
it
would
be
a
special
favor
to
place
him
there
had
he
only
asked
for
an
infantry
appointment
for
the
already
tired
out
man
it
would
have
been
a
far
easier
life
for
him
but
it
had
not
occurred
to
the
general
many
of
us
had
been
laughingly
rechristened
and
called
a
name
that
was
in
some
way
suggested
by
trifling
incidents
in
our
history
the
names
were
absurd
one
of
the
most
delicate
and
refined
of
our
women
was
a
superb
rider
and
had
shot
buffalo
so
her
intimates
spoke
of
her
when
trying
to
provoke
repartee
as
buffalo
my
sobriquet
of
the
old
lady
dated
back
to
the
first
days
of
my
married
life
when
the
general
and
his
merry
young
staff
returned
from
a
raid
in
the
shenandoah
valley
they
descried
an
old
dutchman
who
did
not
care
which
side
in
the
war
succeeded
so
long
as
he
and
his
property
were
left
alone
his
house
had
been
their
in
a
former
raid
and
they
all
rode
up
there
to
halt
again
the
old
hans
stood
on
his
steps
as
they
approached
and
wafted
them
away
at
the
same
time
reiterating
by
way
of
emphasis
gentlemens
i
have
no
objections
to
your
coming
in
but
the
old
lady
she
kicks
agin
after
that
i
could
not
raise
the
mildest
protest
against
any
plan
but
that
those
mischievous
brothers
would
exclaim
pathetically
and
in
a
most
tormenting
tone
what
a
good
time
we
might
have
if
the
old
lady
didn
t
kick
agin
sometimes
the
mildest
and
quietest
one
of
us
all
would
be
called
by
some
appellation
so
suggestive
of
ruffianism
and
bloodshed
that
it
was
the
extreme
of
the
ridiculous
to
associate
the
person
and
the
name
together
for
instance
the
best
regulated
and
least
sensational
one
would
find
himself
addressed
as
shacknasty
bill
or
the
sinewy
slayer
of
the
ghostly
another
always
inclined
to
gloom
was
given
a
rousing
slap
on
the
back
as
his
and
a
hearty
how
are
you
old
skull
and
no
one
escaped
i
used
to
think
the
joking
was
carried
too
far
sometimes
but
it
was
easy
to
go
to
extremes
when
the
resources
were
so
limited
for
a
variety
in
our
life
my
own
blood
rose
to
lava
heat
when
i
found
people
twitting
one
another
on
unpleasant
facts
and
a
smile
of
ridicule
circulating
it
was
too
great
a
triumph
for
the
teaser
to
stir
up
wrath
though
and
the
life
was
a
lesson
of
constant
certainly
it
was
excellent
discipline
and
calculated
to
keep
one
s
within
bounds
it
was
the
same
sort
of
training
that
members
of
a
large
family
have
and
they
profit
by
the
friction
for
they
are
rarely
so
selfish
and
exacting
as
only
children
usually
are
chapter
xxiv
an
indian
council
the
indians
came
several
times
from
the
reservations
for
counsel
but
the
occasion
that
made
the
greatest
impression
upon
me
was
towards
the
spring
they
came
to
implore
the
general
for
food
in
the
fall
the
steamer
bringing
them
supplies
was
detained
in
starting
it
had
hardly
accomplished
half
the
required
distance
before
the
ice
impeded
its
progress
and
it
lay
out
in
the
channel
frozen
in
all
winter
the
suffering
among
the
indians
was
very
great
they
were
compelled
to
eat
their
dogs
and
ponies
to
keep
from
starving
believing
a
personal
appeal
would
be
effectual
they
asked
to
come
to
our
post
for
a
council
the
indian
band
brought
their
great
orator
running
antelope
he
was
intensely
dignified
and
his
face
when
he
spoke
was
expressive
and
animated
contrary
to
all
the
precedents
of
indian
oratory
we
had
become
familiar
with
as
he
stood
among
them
all
in
the
general
s
room
he
made
an
indelible
impression
on
my
memory
the
indians
feet
are
usually
small
sometimes
their
vanity
induces
them
to
put
on
women
s
shoes
the
hands
are
slender
and
marvellously
soft
considering
their
life
of
exposure
their
speech
is
full
of
gesture
and
the
flexible
wrist
makes
their
movements
expressive
a
distinguished
scholar
speaking
of
the
aid
the
hand
is
to
an
orator
calls
it
the
second
it
certainly
was
so
with
running
antelope
he
described
the
distressing
condition
of
the
tribe
with
real
eloquence
while
he
spoke
lifting
his
graceful
hands
towards
heaven
in
appeal
one
of
my
husband
s
birds
that
was
uncaged
floated
down
and
alighted
on
the
venerable
warrior
s
head
it
had
been
so
petted
no
ordinary
movement
startled
the
little
thing
it
maintained
its
poise
spreading
its
wings
to
keep
its
balance
as
the
indian
moved
his
head
in
gesture
the
orator
saw
that
the
faces
of
the
indians
showed
signs
of
humor
but
he
was
ignorant
of
what
amused
them
his
inquiring
eyes
saw
no
solution
in
the
general
s
for
fearing
to
disconcert
him
general
custer
controlled
every
muscle
in
his
face
finally
the
bird
whirled
up
to
his
favorite
on
the
horn
of
the
buffalo
head
and
the
warrior
understood
the
unusual
sight
of
a
smile
from
his
people
his
whole
appeal
was
most
impressive
and
touched
the
quick
sympathies
of
my
husband
he
was
a
sincere
friend
of
the
reservation
indian
the
storehouses
at
our
post
were
filled
with
supplies
and
he
promised
to
telegraph
to
the
great
father
for
permission
to
give
them
rations
until
spring
meantime
he
promised
them
all
they
could
eat
while
they
awaited
at
the
post
the
answer
to
the
despatch
not
content
with
a
complaint
of
their
present
wrongs
running
antelope
went
off
into
an
earliest
denunciation
of
the
agents
calling
them
dishonest
one
of
the
indians
during
the
previous
summer
with
cunning
had
lain
out
on
the
dock
all
day
apparently
sleeping
while
he
watched
the
steamer
unloading
supplies
intended
for
them
a
mental
estimate
was
carefully
made
of
what
came
off
the
boat
and
compared
as
carefully
afterwards
with
what
was
distributed
there
was
an
undeniable
deficit
a
portion
that
should
have
been
theirs
was
detained
and
they
accused
the
agent
of
keeping
it
the
general
interrupted
and
asked
the
interpreter
to
say
that
the
great
father
selected
the
agents
from
among
good
men
before
sending
them
out
from
washington
running
antelope
quickly
responded
they
may
be
good
men
when
they
leave
the
great
father
but
they
get
to
be
desperate
cheats
by
the
time
they
reach
i
shall
have
to
ask
whoever
reads
to
substitute
another
more
forcible
adjective
such
as
an
angry
man
would
use
in
place
of
the
indian
language
is
not
deficient
in
abusive
terms
and
epithets
when
the
council
was
ended
and
the
indians
were
preparing
to
leave
my
husband
asked
me
to
have
mary
put
everything
we
had
ready
to
eat
on
the
table
the
manner
in
which
running
antelope
folded
his
robe
around
him
and
strode
in
a
stately
way
down
the
long
parlor
was
worthy
of
a
roman
emperor
i
had
been
so
impressed
by
his
oratory
and
lordly
mien
that
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
when
i
saw
him
at
table
and
descend
from
the
lofty
state
of
mind
into
which
he
had
taken
me
to
realize
what
he
was
doing
after
gorging
himself
he
emptied
the
plates
and
swept
all
the
remains
from
before
the
places
of
the
other
chiefs
into
the
capacious
folds
of
his
robe
this
he
rebelted
at
the
waist
so
that
it
formed
a
very
good
temporary
haversack
with
an
air
signifying
to
the
victor
belong
the
spoils
he
swept
majestically
out
of
the
house
the
answer
came
next
day
from
the
secretary
of
war
that
the
department
of
the
interior
which
had
the
indians
in
charge
refused
to
allow
any
army
supplies
to
be
distributed
they
gave
as
a
reason
that
it
would
involve
complexities
in
their
relations
with
other
departments
it
was
a
very
difficult
thing
for
the
general
to
explain
to
the
indians
they
knew
that
both
army
and
indians
were
fed
from
the
same
source
and
they
could
not
comprehend
what
difference
it
could
make
when
a
question
of
starvation
was
pending
they
could
not
be
told
what
we
all
knew
that
had
the
war
department
made
good
the
deficiencies
it
would
have
reflected
discredit
on
the
management
of
the
department
of
the
interior
the
chiefs
were
compelled
to
return
to
their
reservations
where
long
ago
all
the
game
had
been
shot
and
their
famishing
tribe
were
many
of
them
driven
to
join
the
hostiles
we
were
not
surprised
that
the
warriors
were
discouraged
and
desperate
and
that
the
depredations
of
sitting
bull
on
the
settlements
increased
with
the
new
accessions
to
his
numbers
chapter
xxv
breaking
up
of
the
missouri
the
day
of
the
final
breaking
up
of
the
ice
in
the
missouri
was
one
of
great
excitement
to
us
the
roar
and
crash
of
the
could
be
heard
a
great
distance
the
sound
of
the
tremendous
report
was
the
signal
for
the
whole
garrison
to
go
out
on
the
hill
near
the
infantry
post
and
watch
the
grand
sight
just
above
us
was
a
bend
in
the
river
and
around
this
curve
great
floes
of
ice
rushed
heaping
up
in
huge
masses
as
they
swept
down
the
furious
current
all
the
lowlands
that
lay
between
bismarck
and
the
river
were
inundated
and
the
shore
far
in
covered
with
blocks
of
ice
that
the
force
of
the
water
had
thrown
there
just
across
the
river
from
us
was
a
wretched
little
collection
of
huts
occupied
by
outlaws
into
which
the
soldiers
were
decoyed
to
drink
and
gamble
the
law
forbidding
liquor
to
be
sold
on
the
reservation
was
so
strict
that
whiskey
venders
did
not
dare
set
foot
on
the
government
land
the
reservation
was
too
large
to
permit
them
to
place
themselves
on
its
other
boundaries
they
would
have
been
at
such
a
distance
from
the
post
that
it
would
not
have
been
worth
while
just
on
the
water
s
edge
opposite
these
human
fiends
had
perched
to
watch
and
entice
the
enlisted
men
over
their
rude
cabins
they
had
painted
elaborate
and
romantically
expressed
signs
in
the
midst
of
bleak
surroundings
rose
an
untidy
cabin
called
my
lady
s
bower
or
over
the
door
of
a
rough
was
a
sign
of
the
dew
drop
inn
do
drop
in
these
shanties
were
placed
on
a
little
rise
of
ground
with
a
precautionary
thought
of
the
usual
spring
floods
the
day
of
the
first
we
saw
the
water
rise
to
such
a
height
that
cabin
after
cabin
was
abandoned
the
occupants
dragged
their
property
as
best
they
could
to
the
little
rise
where
one
or
two
more
cautious
than
the
rest
had
built
on
this
narrow
neck
of
land
huddled
together
the
whole
of
the
group
in
desperate
peril
no
one
on
our
side
of
the
river
could
help
them
for
the
water
was
the
maddest
of
whirlpools
while
on
the
other
side
the
overflow
had
made
a
great
lake
cutting
them
off
from
bismarck
as
we
watched
them
scrambling
on
the
little
knoll
like
drowning
men
clinging
to
the
upturned
keel
of
a
boat
we
suffered
real
distress
at
our
powerlessness
to
help
them
the
company
commanders
remembering
how
they
had
been
the
cause
of
the
demoralization
of
some
of
their
best
soldiers
openly
avowed
at
first
their
relief
that
the
whole
wretched
lot
were
about
to
drown
but
as
the
peril
increased
not
one
of
the
officers
hearts
remained
unsoftened
they
forgot
what
an
utterly
abandoned
lawless
company
it
was
and
wished
that
some
means
might
be
found
by
which
they
could
be
saved
we
women
had
discovered
through
the
a
few
of
our
own
sex
among
them
and
were
alarmed
at
their
danger
for
no
matter
what
they
were
the
helplessness
of
women
at
such
a
time
makes
one
forget
everything
save
that
their
lives
hang
in
the
balance
at
last
one
of
them
stepped
into
the
only
small
boat
they
had
been
able
to
retain
and
standing
bravely
at
the
side
of
the
one
man
at
the
bow
they
were
swept
down
the
river
out
of
sight
among
the
gorge
of
and
never
again
heard
from
it
was
too
exhausting
watching
these
imperilled
beings
knowing
how
incapable
we
were
of
helping
them
and
we
went
back
to
our
quarters
to
spend
hours
of
suspense
we
could
not
set
ourselves
about
doing
anything
while
the
lives
of
human
beings
so
near
us
were
in
jeopardy
as
day
began
to
close
word
came
for
our
relief
that
the
water
was
subsiding
not
alas
until
some
of
them
had
been
borne
to
their
last
home
those
that
were
left
waded
back
to
their
huts
and
unheeding
the
warning
of
that
fearful
day
began
again
their
same
miserable
existence
of
all
our
happy
days
the
happiest
had
now
come
to
us
at
fort
lincoln
i
never
knew
more
united
married
people
than
those
of
our
regiment
it
will
be
easily
understood
that
in
the
close
companionship
involved
in
the
intimate
relationships
of
that
life
either
uncontrollable
hatred
or
increasing
affection
must
ensue
if
a
desperate
attack
of
incompatibility
set
in
out
there
the
climate
fine
as
it
was
simply
had
to
disagree
with
the
wife
for
it
was
next
to
madness
for
both
of
them
if
they
did
not
escape
from
a
life
where
almost
every
hour
is
spent
with
each
other
the
wife
had
the
privilege
of
becoming
the
comrade
of
her
husband
in
that
isolated
existence
and
the
officers
seemed
to
feel
that
every
amusement
was
heightened
if
shared
by
the
other
sex
that
perpetual
intimacy
was
a
crucial
test
of
the
genuineness
of
the
affection
my
husband
used
to
quote
a
line
or
two
from
one
of
stowe
s
books
that
we
had
read
together
the
new
husband
is
asked
why
he
knows
that
he
loves
his
wife
because
she
never
tires
me
she
never
makes
me
he
believed
that
if
husbands
and
wives
bore
that
proof
successfully
as
time
advanced
they
might
count
on
a
happy
future
life
grew
more
enjoyable
every
day
as
we
realized
the
blessings
of
our
home
when
the
winter
was
finally
gone
there
was
not
an
hour
that
we
would
not
have
recalled
i
have
seen
my
husband
with
all
the
abandon
of
a
boy
throw
himself
on
a
rug
in
front
of
the
fire
and
enumerate
his
blessings
with
real
gratitude
speaking
of
his
regiment
first
his
district
for
he
then
had
five
posts
under
his
command
the
hunting
his
dogs
and
horses
and
his
own
room
which
was
an
unceasing
delight
he
used
to
declare
to
me
that
he
would
not
exchange
places
with
any
one
not
even
a
friend
in
civil
life
who
stood
at
the
head
of
his
profession
as
a
journalist
who
had
wealth
and
youth
and
who
lived
in
almost
princely
luxury
my
husband
used
to
tell
me
that
he
believed
he
was
the
happiest
man
on
earth
and
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
he
was
for
with
all
the
vicissitudes
of
those
twelve
eventful
years
i
never
knew
him
to
have
an
hour
s
depression
the
presence
of
so
many
of
his
family
about
him
was
an
unceasing
pleasure
there
was
an
abiding
fondness
between
his
brother
colonel
tom
and
himself
this
brother
was
scarcely
more
than
a
lad
when
he
joined
us
the
general
said
to
some
eastern
friends
when
he
was
in
the
states
the
last
time
to
prove
to
you
how
i
value
and
admire
my
brother
as
a
soldier
i
think
that
he
should
be
the
general
and
i
the
colonel
tom
always
lived
with
us
and
the
brothers
played
incessant
jokes
on
each
other
both
of
them
honored
and
liked
women
extremely
colonel
tom
used
to
pay
visits
of
an
unconscionable
length
to
ladies
of
the
garrison
and
no
amount
of
teasing
on
his
brother
s
part
would
induce
him
to
shorten
them
he
never
knew
when
he
started
to
go
home
from
these
visits
but
that
he
would
find
on
the
young
lady
s
his
trunk
portmanteau
and
satchel
this
as
a
little
hint
from
the
general
that
he
was
overtaxing
the
lady
s
patience
i
used
to
think
my
husband
too
severe
with
his
brother
for
in
his
anxiety
not
to
show
favoritism
he
noticed
the
smallest
misdemeanor
if
in
visiting
with
the
young
ladies
in
our
parlor
he
overstayed
the
hour
he
was
due
at
the
stables
or
drill
the
general
s
eye
noticed
it
and
perhaps
overlooked
others
in
the
room
who
were
erring
in
the
same
manner
i
knew
that
a
reprimand
would
be
sent
from
the
adjutant
s
office
in
the
morning
if
i
did
not
invent
some
way
to
warn
the
offender
so
i
learned
the
for
stables
and
hovering
around
colonel
tom
hummed
it
in
his
ear
which
the
voice
of
the
charmer
had
dulled
to
the
when
the
sound
penetrated
he
would
make
a
plunge
for
his
hat
and
belt
and
tear
out
of
the
house
thus
escaping
reproof
when
spring
came
again
it
is
impossible
to
express
the
joy
i
felt
that
there
was
to
be
no
summer
campaign
and
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
i
saw
the
grass
grow
without
a
shudder
the
general
began
the
improvement
of
the
post
with
fresh
energy
and
from
the
came
the
click
of
the
horses
hoofs
and
the
note
of
the
bugles
repeating
the
commands
of
the
officers
as
soon
as
it
was
warm
enough
several
charming
girls
came
out
from
the
states
to
our
garrison
to
visit
us
they
gave
every
one
pleasure
and
effectually
turned
the
heads
of
the
young
officers
we
had
supposed
that
when
travelling
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
almost
to
the
border
of
the
british
possessions
we
could
safely
call
ourselves
west
but
we
found
that
there
was
a
post
fifteen
hundred
miles
beyond
us
on
the
missouri
river
the
steamers
were
constantly
taking
officers
and
their
families
from
bismarck
into
montana
sometimes
the
delay
of
the
boats
in
starting
gave
us
the
privilege
of
entertaining
them
i
remember
going
down
to
bid
to
a
family
who
had
gone
on
board
a
steamer
at
our
landing
the
officer
was
returning
from
an
infantry
recruiting
detail
in
the
states
he
had
eight
children
and
a
dog
these
with
a
lieutenant
s
pay
constituted
his
riches
he
disappeared
into
a
and
brought
out
the
new
baby
exhibiting
it
with
as
much
pride
as
if
it
had
been
the
they
told
me
afterwards
that
during
all
that
slow
wearisome
journey
of
fifteen
hundred
miles
on
a
boat
that
needs
be
seen
to
be
appreciated
the
mother
was
placid
and
happy
there
were
no
guards
around
the
deck
so
she
tied
the
children
separately
to
the
different
articles
of
stationary
furniture
and
let
them
play
out
to
the
limits
of
their
tethers
almost
our
only
exercise
on
summer
evenings
was
walking
on
the
outskirts
of
the
garrison
surrounded
by
the
dogs
it
was
dangerous
to
go
far
but
we
could
walk
with
safety
in
the
direction
of
the
huts
of
the
indian
scouts
their
life
always
interested
us
and
by
degrees
they
became
so
accustomed
to
our
presence
that
they
went
on
with
all
their
occupations
without
heeding
us
there
was
a
variety
of
articles
among
the
litter
tossed
down
in
front
of
these
indian
quarters
lariats
saddles
and
robes
were
heaped
about
an
arrangement
for
conveying
their
property
from
place
to
place
the
construction
was
simple
and
rendered
wheels
unnecessary
about
midway
on
two
long
saplings
placed
a
short
distance
apart
is
a
foundation
of
leather
thongs
upon
this
the
effects
belonging
to
an
indian
family
are
lashed
two
pole
ends
are
attached
to
either
side
of
a
rude
harness
on
the
pony
while
the
other
two
drag
on
the
ground
in
following
an
indian
trail
the
indentation
made
by
the
poles
as
they
are
pulled
over
the
ground
traces
the
course
of
travel
unmistakably
some
of
their
boats
lay
upturned
about
the
door
they
were
perfectly
round
like
a
great
bowl
and
composed
of
a
wicker
frame
over
which
buffalo
hide
was
tightly
drawn
the
primitive
shape
and
construction
dates
back
to
the
ancient
egyptians
and
these
boats
were
called
coracles
in
olden
times
they
seemed
barely
large
enough
to
hold
two
indians
who
were
obliged
to
crouch
down
as
they
paddled
their
way
with
short
awkward
oars
through
the
rapid
current
of
the
missouri
bloody
knife
was
naturally
mournful
his
face
still
looked
sad
when
he
put
on
the
presents
given
him
he
was
a
perfect
child
about
gifts
and
the
general
studied
to
bring
him
something
from
the
east
that
no
other
indian
had
he
had
proved
himself
such
an
invaluable
scout
to
the
general
that
they
often
had
long
interviews
seated
on
the
grass
the
dogs
lying
about
them
they
talked
over
portions
of
the
country
that
the
general
had
never
seen
the
scout
drawing
excellent
maps
in
the
sand
with
a
pointed
stick
he
was
sometimes
petulant
often
moody
and
it
required
the
utmost
patience
on
my
husband
s
part
to
submit
to
his
humors
but
his
fidelity
and
cleverness
made
it
worth
while
to
yield
to
his
tempers
i
was
always
interested
in
the
one
pretty
squaw
among
them
called
which
means
medicine
mother
her
husband
was
young
and
she
was
devoted
to
him
i
have
seen
him
lounging
on
the
floor
of
the
hut
while
she
made
his
toilet
combing
and
plaiting
his
hair
cutting
and
oiling
the
bangs
which
were
trimmed
to
cover
his
forehead
and
plucking
the
few
scattered
hairs
from
his
chin
for
they
do
not
consider
it
an
honor
to
have
a
suspicion
of
a
beard
she
strapped
on
his
leggings
buckled
his
belt
and
finally
lighted
his
pipe
once
the
war
bonnet
of
her
lord
had
to
be
rearranged
he
deigned
to
put
it
on
her
head
readjusted
the
eagle
feathers
and
then
gave
it
to
her
to
fasten
them
in
securely
the
faithful
slave
even
used
to
accompany
him
to
his
bath
indians
do
bathe
at
long
intervals
i
was
not
ambitious
to
know
if
she
actually
performed
the
ablutions
however
i
have
seen
him
at
a
distance
running
along
the
river
bank
on
his
return
his
wife
waving
a
blanket
behind
him
to
keep
off
the
mosquitoes
if
the
indians
kill
any
game
they
return
home
order
the
squaws
to
take
the
ponies
and
bring
back
what
they
have
killed
and
then
throw
themselves
down
to
sleep
among
the
sprawling
indian
babies
tailless
dogs
and
general
filth
the
squaws
do
all
the
labor
and
every
skin
is
tanned
by
their
busy
fingers
i
never
knew
but
one
indian
who
worked
he
was
an
object
of
interest
to
me
though
he
kept
himself
within
the
gloom
of
the
cabin
and
skulked
around
the
fire
when
he
cooked
this
was
the
occupation
forced
upon
him
by
the
others
he
had
lacked
the
courage
to
endure
the
torture
of
the
for
when
strips
of
flexible
wood
had
been
drawn
through
the
gashes
in
his
back
and
he
was
hung
up
by
these
the
poor
creature
had
fainted
on
reviving
he
begged
to
be
cut
down
and
ever
after
was
an
object
of
scorn
he
was
condemned
to
wear
squaw
s
clothing
from
that
time
on
they
mocked
and
taunted
him
and
he
led
as
separate
an
existence
as
if
he
were
in
a
desert
alone
the
squaws
disdained
to
notice
him
except
to
heap
work
upon
his
already
burdened
shoulders
once
my
husband
and
i
in
walking
came
suddenly
upon
a
queer
little
mound
that
we
concluded
we
would
observe
at
a
distance
an
indian
was
seen
carrying
buckets
and
creeping
with
difficulty
into
the
small
aperture
it
was
about
six
feet
in
diameter
and
proved
to
be
a
kind
of
which
they
consider
great
medicine
a
hole
is
first
dug
in
the
ground
and
filled
with
stones
a
fire
is
kindled
upon
them
long
before
and
they
are
heated
the
round
framework
of
saplings
over
these
is
covered
with
layer
upon
layer
of
blankets
and
robes
so
that
no
air
can
penetrate
the
indians
almost
stripped
of
their
clothing
crouch
round
them
while
the
one
acting
as
servant
brings
water
to
pour
on
the
heated
rocks
the
steam
has
no
escape
and
the
indians
are
thoroughly
roasted
while
we
were
looking
at
this
curious
a
small
indian
boy
crept
out
from
under
the
edges
of
the
blankets
and
ashamed
to
have
given
in
before
the
rest
drew
his
almost
parboiled
little
body
into
a
ever
ambitious
like
small
boys
of
all
nationalities
he
had
at
first
believed
experience
better
than
hearsay
we
went
one
day
into
a
tepee
that
was
placed
by
itself
to
see
an
indian
who
was
only
slightly
his
father
and
friends
were
talking
to
him
of
his
death
as
a
certainty
and
making
all
the
plans
in
advance
they
even
took
his
measure
for
a
coffin
assuring
him
that
they
would
honor
him
by
putting
him
in
a
box
in
imitation
of
the
white
man
the
general
used
to
listen
wonderingly
when
they
referred
to
their
dead
in
the
speeches
in
council
it
was
always
in
some
roundabout
way
never
directly
the
indians
all
seemed
a
melancholy
people
they
sometimes
ask
embarrassing
questions
perhaps
when
some
young
girl
accompanied
us
they
spoke
to
my
husband
in
the
sign
language
in
which
he
was
versed
once
they
inquired
if
the
young
lady
was
his
other
wife
the
blush
of
the
girl
so
amused
us
that
our
laugh
rang
out
among
them
and
seemed
to
be
a
sound
they
knew
nothing
of
they
sat
on
the
ground
for
hours
gambling
for
iron
brass
and
silver
rings
but
always
glum
and
taciturn
the
tallest
indian
of
them
all
long
soldier
grew
to
be
very
cunning
when
he
learned
what
a
curiosity
he
was
he
would
crouch
down
at
our
approach
and
only
at
the
sight
of
a
coin
as
a
tip
would
he
draw
up
his
seven
feet
of
height
the
ree
scouts
entertained
their
chief
during
the
summer
we
were
all
asked
to
the
feast
and
all
formally
presented
to
the
distinguished
stranger
who
could
not
comprehend
why
he
was
expected
to
shake
hands
with
women
after
going
through
what
he
found
was
courtesy
among
the
whites
he
offered
us
a
place
around
the
circle
taking
a
bone
from
the
meat
broiling
before
the
fire
he
offered
it
to
the
general
my
husband
after
getting
some
salt
had
the
courage
to
eat
it
it
was
want
of
tact
on
my
part
to
decline
but
my
heart
failed
me
when
i
recognized
the
master
of
ceremonies
for
the
evening
as
he
proffered
me
some
meat
i
found
him
to
be
the
savage
who
had
killed
his
enemy
from
another
tribe
and
eaten
his
heart

chapter
xxvi
curious
characters
and
excursionists
among
us
i
wish
that
i
could
recall
more
about
the
curious
characters
among
us
most
of
them
had
some
strange
history
in
the
states
that
had
been
the
cause
of
their
seeking
the
wild
life
of
the
frontier
the
one
whose
past
we
would
have
liked
best
to
know
was
a
man
most
valued
by
my
husband
all
the
important
scoutings
and
most
difficult
missions
where
secrecy
was
required
were
intrusted
to
him
we
had
no
certain
knowledge
whether
or
not
he
had
any
family
or
friends
elsewhere
for
he
never
spoke
of
them
he
acknowledged
once
in
a
brief
moment
of
confidence
that
he
was
a
gentleman
by
birth
startled
perhaps
by
the
look
of
curiosity
that
even
a
friend
s
face
showed
he
turned
the
conversation
and
said
oh
but
what
s
the
use
to
refer
to
it
now
we
did
not
even
know
whether
charley
reynolds
was
his
real
name
or
one
that
he
had
assumed
soon
after
we
reached
dakota
the
general
began
to
employ
him
as
a
scout
he
remained
with
him
much
of
the
time
until
he
fell
in
the
battle
of
the
little
big
horn
my
husband
had
such
genuine
admiration
for
him
that
i
soon
learned
to
listen
to
everything
pertaining
to
his
life
with
marked
interest
he
was
so
shy
that
he
hardly
raised
his
eyes
when
i
extended
my
hand
at
the
general
s
introduction
he
did
not
assume
the
picturesque
dress
long
hair
and
belt
full
of
weapons
that
are
characteristic
of
the
scout
his
manner
was
perfectly
simple
and
straightforward
and
he
could
not
be
induced
to
talk
of
himself
he
had
large
eyes
and
a
frank
face
year
after
year
he
braved
the
awful
winters
of
dakota
alone
i
have
known
him
start
out
from
fort
lincoln
when
even
our
officers
accustomed
as
they
were
to
hardships
were
forbidden
to
go
he
had
been
the
best
shot
and
most
successful
hunter
in
the
territory
for
fifteen
years
when
i
watched
the
scouts
starting
off
on
their
missions
i
invariably
thanked
heaven
that
i
was
born
a
woman
and
consequently
no
deed
of
valor
would
ever
be
expected
from
me
i
felt
though
that
were
i
compelled
to
be
brave
i
would
far
rather
go
into
battle
with
the
inspiration
of
the
and
the
clash
of
arms
than
go
off
alone
and
take
my
life
in
my
hands
as
did
the
scouts
the
year
that
the
regiment
explored
the
black
hills
charley
reynolds
undertook
to
carry
despatches
through
to
fort
laramie
over
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
distant
he
had
only
his
compass
to
guide
him
for
there
was
not
even
a
trail
the
country
was
infested
with
indians
and
he
could
only
travel
at
night
during
the
day
he
hid
his
horse
as
well
as
he
could
in
the
underbrush
and
lay
down
in
the
long
grass
in
spite
of
these
precautions
he
was
sometimes
so
exposed
that
he
could
hear
the
voices
of
indians
passing
near
he
often
crossed
indian
trails
on
his
journey
the
last
nights
of
his
march
he
was
compelled
to
walk
as
his
horse
was
exhausted
and
he
found
no
water
for
hours
the
frontiersmen
frequently
dig
in
the
beds
of
streams
and
find
water
but
this
resource
failed
his
lips
became
so
parched
and
his
throat
so
swollen
that
he
could
not
close
his
mouth
in
this
condition
he
reached
fort
laramie
and
delivered
his
despatches
it
was
from
the
people
of
that
post
that
the
general
heard
of
his
narrow
escape
he
came
quietly
back
to
his
post
at
fort
lincoln
and
only
confessed
to
his
dangers
when
closely
questioned
by
the
general
long
afterwards
when
i
think
how
gloriously
he
fell
fighting
for
his
country
with
all
the
valor
and
fidelity
of
one
of
her
officers
my
eyes
fill
with
tears
for
he
lies
there
on
that
unwept
unhonored
and
unsung
had
he
worn
all
the
insignia
of
the
high
rank
and
the
decorations
of
an
adoring
country
he
could
not
have
led
a
braver
life
or
died
a
more
heroic
death
and
yet
he
is
chronicled
as
only
a
we
were
inundated
with
excursionists
during
the
summer
in
order
to
induce
immigration
the
railroads
had
reduced
the
rates
one
of
the
incidents
of
the
trip
was
to
cross
from
bismarck
to
fort
lincoln
sometimes
i
had
assistance
in
entertaining
but
oftener
i
was
left
to
perform
this
duty
alone
i
have
been
sitting
with
the
general
and
four
of
his
family
when
we
would
see
the
unloading
at
the
door
in
an
instant
i
would
find
myself
standing
alone
in
the
room
the
vanishing
forms
of
all
the
family
disappearing
through
the
doors
and
even
out
of
the
windows
opening
upon
the
piazza
in
vain
i
entreated
them
to
return
a
smothered
laugh
at
my
indignation
was
all
the
response
it
was
sometimes
tiresome
to
receive
large
groups
of
people
who
wanted
to
know
impossible
things
about
the
country
and
if
it
was
a
good
soil
for
wheat
i
only
remember
one
party
who
taxed
my
patience
to
the
uttermost
they
cared
nothing
about
dakota
as
an
agricultural
territory
but
had
come
on
purpose
to
see
the
general
to
satisfy
them
i
sent
the
servants
and
orderly
to
find
him
but
all
returned
with
the
same
answer
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
walked
about
the
garrison
with
them
explaining
our
post
as
best
i
could
the
band
came
to
play
for
them
and
finally
as
a
last
resort
i
opened
the
general
s
room
to
show
them
his
hunting
mementos
it
was
all
of
no
avail
one
very
decided
woman
said
this
is
all
very
interesting
but
we
to
see
general
custer
and
we
do
not
intend
to
leave
until
we
finally
i
said
in
desperation
he
is
much
interested
in
improvements
for
the
post
and
spends
much
time
very
well
said
the
chief
spokesman
we
will
go
all
around
the
garrison
and
try
to
find
as
soon
as
i
had
bowed
them
away
i
ran
out
to
mary
to
ask
where
the
general
really
was
i
had
known
from
the
first
by
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
that
she
was
helping
him
to
escape
law
miss
libbie
the
giniral
most
got
sunstroke
hidin
in
the
the
coop
was
still
unroofed
and
my
husband
had
been
superintending
the
building
of
a
double
wall
to
keep
out
the
cold
in
winter
and
there
i
found
him
really
ill
having
beaten
his
hasty
retreat
without
a
hat
and
remained
in
the
broiling
sun
rather
than
submit
to
the
odious
ordeal
of
being
on
exhibition
our
house
was
so
full
of
company
and
we
had
so
little
time
for
each
other
that
in
order
to
visit
together
we
were
obliged
to
take
our
horses
and
ride
up
and
down
the
valley
as
far
as
it
was
safe
to
go
even
then
my
husband
s
eyes
scanned
the
horizon
so
searchingly
hardly
turning
his
face
away
from
where
the
indians
were
wont
to
dash
that
it
intimidated
me
to
see
such
watchfulness
if
we
went
even
a
few
paces
beyond
our
usual
beat
which
was
bounded
by
the
grazing
stock
and
the
guard
and
the
busy
chatter
at
his
side
ceased
my
husband
would
look
quickly
to
see
the
cause
of
the
unusual
silence
my
lip
quivered
with
fear
and
i
was
wont
to
wink
busily
and
swallow
to
keep
back
a
tear
of
terror
of
which
i
was
always
ashamed
and
against
which
i
made
constant
battle
the
moment
our
horses
heads
were
turned
towards
home
the
endless
flow
of
laughter
and
talk
began
again
when
we
could
not
ride
we
went
out
on
the
bluffs
just
on
the
edge
of
the
garrison
for
an
uninterrupted
hour
we
were
often
out
for
hours
my
husband
shooting
at
a
mark
while
i
was
equally
busy
taking
accurate
aim
at
the
mosquito
our
constant
companion
in
all
our
good
times
as
the
soldiers
and
citizens
all
knew
the
general
s
love
of
pets
we
had
constant
presents
many
of
them
i
would
have
gladly
declined
but
notwithstanding
a
badger
porcupine
raccoon
and
all
served
their
brief
time
as
members
of
our
family
they
were
comparatively
harmless
and
i
had
only
the
inconvenience
to
encounter
when
a
ferocious
was
brought
in
with
a
triumphant
air
by
the
donor
and
presented
with
a
great
flourish
i
was
inclined
to
mutiny
my
husband
made
allowance
for
my
dread
of
the
untamed
creature
and
decided
to
send
him
into
the
states
as
a
present
to
one
of
the
zoological
gardens
for
in
its
way
it
was
a
treasure
while
it
remained
with
us
it
was
kept
in
the
cellar
mary
used
to
make
many
retreats
tumbling
up
the
stairs
when
the
cat
flew
at
her
the
length
of
its
chain
she
was
startled
so
often
that
at
last
she
joined
with
me
in
requesting
its
removal
as
soon
as
convenient
the
general
regretted
giving
it
up
but
keevan
was
called
to
chloroform
and
box
it
for
the
journey
colonel
tom
printed
some
facetious
words
on
the
slats
of
the
cover
something
like
do
not
they
were
somewhat
superfluous
for
no
one
could
approach
the
box
after
the
effects
of
the
chloroform
had
passed
away
without
encountering
the
eyes
and
such
scratchings
and
spittings
and
mad
plunges
as
suggested
the
propriety
of
keeping
one
s
distance
some
detention
kept
the
at
a
station
over
sunday
the
box
with
the
was
put
in
the
the
violence
of
the
animal
as
it
leaped
and
tore
at
the
cover
loosened
the
slats
and
it
escaped
into
the
room
the
freight
agent
spent
a
wretched
day
chloroform
was
again
resorted
to
and
it
was
deemed
a
good
riddance
when
the
animal
was
sent
off
when
we
received
a
letter
of
thanks
from
the
scientific
board
for
so
splendid
a
specimen
i
was
relieved
to
know
that
the
was
at
last
where
it
could
no
longer
create
a
reign
of
terror
at
one
time
the
general
tamed
a
tiny
and
kept
it
in
a
large
empty
inkstand
on
his
desk
it
grew
very
fond
of
him
and
ran
over
his
head
and
shoulders
and
even
through
his
hair
women
are
not
responsible
for
their
fear
of
mice
they
are
born
so
i
had
fortunately
only
to
keep
away
from
the
desk
when
the
little
creature
was
free
for
it
was
contented
to
consider
that
its
domain
the
general
thinking
at
last
that
it
was
cruel
to
detain
the
little
thing
when
it
belonged
by
nature
to
the
fields
took
it
out
and
left
it
on
the
plain
the
kindness
was
of
no
earthly
use
like
the
prisoner
of
the
bastile
it
was
back
again
at
the
steps
in
no
time
and
preferred
captivity
to
freedom
chapter
xxvii
religious
leave
of
absence
we
had
clergymen
and
missionaries
of
different
denominations
as
our
guests
during
the
summer
months
among
them
was
a
man
from
the
east
who
was
full
of
zeal
and
indifferent
to
the
opinion
of
others
as
long
as
he
felt
that
he
was
right
he
began
to
brave
public
opinion
on
his
way
to
fort
lincoln
the
cars
had
stopped
for
some
time
at
a
station
where
there
was
a
town
the
missionary
wishing
to
improve
every
opportunity
for
doing
good
went
out
on
the
platform
and
began
a
sermon
before
long
he
had
a
crowd
of
people
around
him
listening
with
curiosity
there
were
laughter
and
sneers
when
the
quavering
voice
of
the
old
man
started
a
hymn
that
was
familiar
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
no
one
joined
our
brother
tom
and
a
friend
sitting
in
the
car
but
knowing
nothing
of
the
mission
of
the
man
realized
his
unsupported
position
and
quickly
went
to
him
standing
on
either
side
of
him
they
joined
their
fresh
young
voices
in
the
hymn
before
long
one
after
the
other
of
the
crowd
joined
in
the
music
inspired
by
the
independence
of
the
example
the
missionary
returned
then
with
the
officers
and
came
to
our
house
where
my
husband
asked
him
to
remain
indefinitely
we
found
him
almost
a
monomaniac
on
the
subject
of
converting
the
indians
and
had
not
the
general
prevented
him
from
risking
his
life
he
would
have
gone
out
alone
among
the
warlike
tribes
while
he
was
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
go
farther
west
he
begged
to
begin
meetings
among
the
soldiers
and
said
that
in
order
to
do
more
good
and
get
at
the
hearts
of
those
he
would
help
he
must
live
among
them
for
this
purpose
he
left
us
and
went
down
to
share
the
rations
of
the
enlisted
men
the
general
had
a
room
in
a
vacant
barrack
put
in
order
and
there
the
old
man
began
his
work
every
night
the
garrison
echoed
with
the
voices
of
hundreds
of
soldiers
singing
hymns
the
simple
unaffected
goodness
of
the
missionary
caused
them
to
believe
in
him
and
he
found
his
way
to
many
a
heart
that
beat
under
the
army
blue
my
husband
felt
thankful
to
have
some
work
go
on
among
the
enlisted
men
we
often
talked
of
their
condition
and
he
felt
that
some
of
the
energies
of
good
people
in
behalf
of
foreign
missions
might
well
be
expended
upon
our
army
on
the
frontier
among
his
plans
was
the
building
of
an
at
the
post
especially
for
the
soldiers
a
place
where
they
could
have
their
own
entertainments
and
where
the
papers
magazines
and
general
library
might
be
kept
he
regretted
constantly
that
there
was
no
regular
place
where
there
could
be
services
for
the
men
when
the
itinerant
clergyman
came
the
service
was
usually
held
in
our
parlor
but
it
was
only
large
enough
for
the
officers
and
their
families
in
the
following
letter
he
touches
upon
the
subject
of
bettering
the
condition
of
the
enlisted
men
and
bears
tribute
to
the
good
man
who
forgot
himself
in
his
love
for
mankind
fort
lincoln
dakota
dear
sir
i
take
the
liberty
of
addressing
you
a
few
lines
in
regard
to
the
christian
work
in
which
matchett
has
been
engaged
at
this
post
he
came
here
under
the
auspices
of
the
indian
bureau
intending
to
labor
among
the
tribes
of
the
upper
missouri
river
but
owing
to
some
obstacles
encountered
at
points
above
this
on
the
river
he
returned
here
some
weeks
ago
to
await
further
instructions
from
those
under
whom
he
is
acting
in
the
mean
time
he
has
devoted
himself
to
missionary
work
among
the
soldiers
a
class
whose
moral
welfare
at
least
on
the
frontier
is
as
sadly
neglected
as
that
of
any
of
our
aboriginal
tribes
matchett
enters
into
his
work
with
great
earnestness
and
zeal
he
has
impressed
all
with
whom
he
has
been
associated
with
his
unselfishness
his
honesty
of
purpose
and
his
great
desire
to
do
good
it
is
but
due
to
him
and
the
holy
cause
he
represents
and
a
pleasure
to
me
to
testify
to
the
success
which
has
crowned
his
labors
particularly
among
the
soldiers
of
this
command
if
our
large
posts
on
the
remote
frontier
which
are
situated
far
from
church
and
church
influences
had
chaplains
who
were
as
faithful
christians
as
i
believe
matchett
to
be
and
who
like
him
are
willing
to
labor
faithfully
among
the
enlisted
men
the
moral
standard
now
necessarily
so
low
among
that
neglected
class
would
be
elevated
far
above
its
present
level
and
great
results
would
follow
hoping
you
will
receive
these
lines
in
the
spirit
which
prompts
me
to
send
them
i
am
truly
yours
g
custer
brevet
in
the
autumn
we
went
into
the
states
and
spent
most
of
the
winter
delightfully
in
new
york
we
went
out
a
great
deal
of
course
we
were
compelled
to
dress
very
plainly
and
my
husband
made
great
sport
of
his
only
citizen
overcoat
an
ulster
he
declared
that
it
belonged
so
to
the
past
that
he
was
the
only
man
beside
the
that
wore
one
it
did
not
disturb
him
in
the
least
neither
did
going
in
the
to
receptions
and
dinners
he
used
laughingly
to
say
our
coachman
wears
our
livery
libbie
when
the
had
on
an
army
overcoat
no
one
so
perfectly
independent
as
he
was
could
fail
to
enjoy
everything
colonel
tom
and
one
of
the
oldest
friends
we
had
in
the
were
with
us
part
of
the
time
and
we
had
many
enjoyable
hours
together
the
theatre
was
our
unfailing
delight
they
were
all
desirous
that
i
should
see
the
military
play
of
ours
which
was
then
so
admirably
put
on
the
stage
at
wallack
s
but
dreaded
the
effect
it
would
have
on
me
at
last
one
of
them
said
that
it
was
too
finely
represented
for
me
to
miss
and
i
heard
them
say
to
each
other
we
must
take
the
old
lady
though
it
will
break
her
heart
and
she
will
it
ended
in
my
going
when
we
reached
the
part
in
the
play
where
the
farewell
comes
and
the
sword
is
buckled
on
the
warrior
by
the
trembling
hands
of
the
wife
i
could
not
endure
it
too
often
had
the
reality
of
such
suffering
been
my
own
the
three
men
were
crying
like
children
and
only
too
willing
to
take
me
out
into
the
fresh
air
my
husband
spent
many
hours
with
barrett
in
his
at
the
theatre
during
the
long
wait
of
in
the
play
of
julius
there
were
forty
nights
that
these
friends
sat
side
by
side
until
the
summoned
the
actor
to
the
footlights
the
general
listened
every
evening
with
unflagging
interest
to
the
acting
of
his
friend
every
one
seemed
to
vie
with
every
one
else
in
showing
appreciation
of
my
husband
during
that
winter
he
dined
often
with
men
who
learned
to
draw
him
out
in
talk
of
his
plains
life
while
in
the
midst
of
some
story
the
butler
would
pass
him
a
dish
that
he
especially
liked
the
host
at
once
directed
the
man
to
pass
on
and
told
my
husband
that
he
could
not
spare
time
for
him
to
take
a
second
helping
while
they
were
impatient
for
the
rest
of
the
tale
after
going
hungry
once
or
twice
the
general
learned
to
dine
with
me
before
he
left
the
hotel
so
that
he
might
be
free
to
give
himself
up
to
others
he
repeated
a
story
to
me
about
ole
bull
who
was
asked
to
dinner
and
requested
to
bring
his
violin
he
accepted
for
himself
but
sent
word
that
his
violin
did
not
dine
my
husband
made
a
personal
application
of
the
story
and
threatened
playfully
to
send
word
that
his
indian
stories
did
not
dine
hoping
thereby
to
secure
to
himself
the
privilege
of
satisfying
his
hunger
unmolested
at
the
century
club
he
received
from
distinguished
men
the
most
cordial
congratulations
on
his
essay
into
the
literary
field
they
urged
him
with
many
an
encouraging
word
to
continue
the
work
some
of
the
authors
he
met
there
were
double
his
age
and
he
received
each
word
they
said
with
deep
gratitude
my
husband
knew
how
i
valued
every
expression
of
appreciation
of
him
and
he
used
to
awaken
me
when
he
returned
to
tell
me
what
was
said
he
never
failed
to
preface
every
such
hesitating
and
reluctant
repetition
by
exacting
promises
of
secrecy
he
feared
that
in
my
wifely
pride
i
might
repeat
what
he
told
me
and
it
would
look
like
conceit
on
his
part
i
knew
that
he
did
not
tell
me
the
half
for
when
the
tears
of
delight
dropped
from
my
eyes
at
the
acknowledgment
and
commendation
of
others
his
voice
ceased
i
felt
that
nine
years
was
a
long
time
out
of
a
young
life
to
live
in
the
wilderness
away
from
the
sound
of
approving
voices
and
the
association
of
men
whose
very
presence
incites
to
new
effort
in
february
we
had
to
say
to
all
this
pleasurable
life
our
friends
asked
us
why
we
went
so
soon
in
army
life
it
is
perfectly
natural
to
speak
of
one
s
financial
condition
and
it
did
not
occur
to
us
that
civilians
do
not
do
the
same
i
do
not
wonder
now
that
they
opened
their
eyes
with
astonishment
when
we
said
we
were
obliged
to
go
because
we
had
used
all
the
money
we
had
saved
for
leave
of
absence
chapter
xxviii
a
winter
s
journey
across
the
plains
when
we
reached
paul
the
prospect
before
us
was
dismal
as
the
trains
were
not
to
begin
running
until
april
at
the
soonest
the
railroad
officials
mindful
of
what
the
general
had
done
for
them
in
protecting
their
advance
workers
in
the
building
of
the
road
came
and
offered
to
open
the
route
sending
us
through
on
a
special
train
was
a
great
undertaking
and
we
had
to
wait
some
time
for
the
preparations
to
be
completed
one
of
the
officers
of
the
road
took
an
engine
out
some
distance
to
investigate
and
it
looked
discouraging
enough
when
he
sprang
down
from
the
cab
on
his
return
in
a
complete
coating
of
ice
the
train
on
which
we
finally
started
was
an
immense
one
and
certainly
a
curiosity
there
were
two
and
three
enormous
engines
with
coal
supplies
and
baggage
several
with
stock
belonging
to
the
black
hills
miners
who
filled
the
there
was
an
looming
up
above
everything
built
on
a
flat
car
in
this
car
the
forty
employés
of
the
road
who
were
taken
to
shovel
snow
were
fed
there
were
several
with
army
recruits
and
a
few
passengers
and
last
of
all
the
paymaster
s
car
which
my
husband
and
i
occupied
this
had
a
kitchen
and
a
at
first
everything
went
smoothly
the
cook
on
our
car
gave
us
excellent
things
to
eat
and
we
slept
soundly
it
was
intensely
cold
but
the
little
stove
in
the
was
kept
filled
constantly
sometimes
we
came
to
drifts
and
the
train
would
stop
with
a
violent
jerk
start
again
and
once
more
come
to
a
with
such
force
that
the
dishes
would
fall
from
the
table
the
were
ordered
out
and
after
energetic
work
by
the
stalwart
arms
the
track
was
again
clear
and
we
went
on
one
day
we
seemed
to
be
creeping
the
engines
whistled
and
we
shot
on
finely
the
speed
was
checked
so
suddenly
that
the
little
stove
fairly
danced
and
our
belongings
flew
through
the
car
from
end
to
end
after
this
there
was
an
exodus
from
the
cars
every
one
went
to
inquire
as
to
the
ominous
stop
before
our
train
there
seemed
to
be
a
perfect
wall
of
ice
we
had
come
to
a
gully
which
was
almost
filled
with
drifts
the
cars
were
all
backed
down
some
distance
and
detached
the
and
engines
having
thus
full
sweep
all
the
steam
possible
was
put
on
and
they
began
what
they
called
bucking
the
this
did
a
little
good
at
first
and
we
made
some
progress
through
the
gully
after
one
tremendous
dash
however
the
ploughs
and
one
engine
were
so
deeply
embedded
that
they
could
not
be
withdrawn
the
employés
dug
and
shovelled
until
they
were
exhausted
the
black
hills
miners
relieved
them
as
long
as
they
could
endure
it
then
the
officers
and
recruits
worked
until
they
could
do
no
more
the
impenetrable
bank
of
snow
was
the
accumulation
of
the
whole
winter
first
snowing
then
freezing
until
there
were
successive
layers
of
ice
and
snow
it
was
the
most
dispiriting
and
forlorn
situation
night
was
descending
and
my
husband
after
restlessly
going
in
and
out
to
the
next
car
showed
me
that
he
had
some
perplexity
on
his
mind
he
described
to
me
the
discomfort
of
the
officers
and
bismarck
citizens
in
the
other
coach
in
not
having
any
place
to
sleep
his
meaning
penetrated
at
last
and
i
said
you
are
waiting
for
me
to
invite
them
all
to
room
with
us
his
exactly
assured
me
it
was
precisely
what
he
intended
me
to
do
so
he
hurried
out
to
give
them
my
compliments
and
the
invitation
the
officers
are
generally
prepared
for
emergencies
and
they
brought
in
their
blankets
the
citizens
left
themselves
to
the
general
s
planning
in
order
to
make
the
go
further
he
made
two
of
the
into
one
broad
one
two
little
berths
on
each
side
and
rolls
of
bedding
on
the
floor
left
only
room
for
the
stove
always
heated
to
the
last
degree
i
was
invited
to
take
the
farthest
place
towards
the
wall
in
the
large
bed
then
came
my
husband
after
that
i
burrowed
my
head
in
my
pillow
and
the
servant
blew
out
some
of
the
candles
and
brought
in
our
guests
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
say
that
i
did
not
see
the
order
in
which
they
appeared
the
audible
sleeping
in
our
bed
however
through
the
long
nights
that
followed
convinced
me
that
the
general
had
assigned
those
places
to
the
oldest
fattest
and
ranking
civilians
every
morning
i
awoke
to
find
the
room
empty
and
all
the
beds
folded
away
the
general
brought
me
a
tin
basin
with
and
helped
me
to
make
a
quick
toilet
our
eleven
visitors
waited
in
the
other
coach
to
return
to
breakfast
with
us
in
the
same
room
every
one
made
the
best
of
the
situation
and
my
husband
was
as
rollicking
as
ever
though
i
tried
to
conceal
it
i
soon
lost
heart
entirely
and
it
cost
me
great
effort
to
join
with
the
rest
in
conversation
the
days
seemed
to
stretch
on
endlessly
the
snow
was
heaped
up
about
us
and
falling
steadily
all
we
could
see
was
the
trackless
waste
of
white
on
every
side
the
wind
whistled
and
moaned
around
the
cars
and
great
gusts
rocked
our
frail
little
refuge
from
side
to
side
the
snow
that
had
begun
to
fall
with
a
few
scattered
flakes
now
came
down
more
thickly
i
made
the
best
effort
i
could
to
be
brave
and
deceived
them
as
to
my
real
terrors
i
had
no
other
idea
than
that
we
must
die
there
we
tried
to
be
merry
at
our
meals
and
made
light
of
the
deficiencies
that
occurred
each
time
we
sat
down
the
increase
at
the
table
quickly
diminished
our
stores
and
i
knew
by
the
careful
manner
in
which
the
wood
was
husbanded
that
it
was
nearly
exhausted
the
general
always
cool
and
never
daunted
by
anything
was
even
more
blithe
to
keep
me
from
knowing
that
there
was
anything
alarming
in
the
situation
if
i
could
have
worked
as
the
men
did
even
though
it
was
at
the
hopeless
the
time
would
not
have
seemed
so
long
of
course
i
had
but
at
such
a
time
any
industry
that
admits
of
thinking
is
of
little
use
as
a
distraction
during
those
anxious
days
it
used
to
seem
strange
to
hear
a
through
the
air
muffled
with
snow
for
an
instant
i
was
deluded
into
the
thought
that
by
some
strange
necromancy
we
had
been
spirited
on
to
a
station
and
that
this
was
the
clang
of
the
bell
it
was
only
the
call
from
the
car
where
the
employés
were
fed
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
and
howling
of
our
dogs
in
the
forward
cars
were
the
only
other
sounds
we
heard
finally
the
situation
became
desperate
and
with
all
their
efforts
the
officers
could
no
longer
conceal
from
me
their
concern
for
our
safety
search
was
made
throughout
all
the
train
to
find
if
there
was
a
man
who
understood
anything
about
telegraphy
for
among
the
fittings
stowed
away
in
the
car
a
tiny
battery
had
been
found
with
a
a
man
was
finally
discovered
who
knew
something
of
operating
and
it
was
decided
to
cut
the
main
wire
then
the
wires
of
the
were
carried
out
of
our
car
and
fastened
to
either
end
of
the
cut
wire
outside
so
making
an
unbroken
circuit
between
us
and
our
lincoln
friends
besides
uniting
us
with
fargo
station
in
a
little
while
the
general
had
an
answer
from
colonel
tom
most
characteristic
shall
i
come
out
for
you
you
say
nothing
about
the
old
lady
is
she
with
you
the
old
lady
begged
the
privilege
of
framing
the
reply
i
regretted
that
the
telegram
could
not
be
underscored
a
woman
s
only
way
of
emphasizing
for
i
emphatically
forbade
him
to
come
on
this
occasion
i
dared
to
assume
a
show
of
authority
the
stories
of
the
risk
and
suffering
of
our
during
the
two
previous
winters
were
too
fresh
in
my
memory
for
me
to
consent
that
colonel
tom
should
encounter
so
much
for
our
sake
after
that
we
kept
the
wires
busy
talking
with
our
friends
and
devising
plans
for
our
relief
we
only
succeeded
in
suppressing
our
headlong
brother
temporarily
against
our
direct
refusal
he
made
all
his
preparations
and
only
telegraphed
when
it
was
too
late
to
receive
an
answer
that
he
was
leaving
garrison
then
our
situation
was
forgotten
in
our
solicitude
about
him
the
time
seemed
to
move
on
leaden
wings
and
yet
it
was
in
reality
not
long
he
went
to
bismarck
and
looked
up
the
best
in
all
the
territory
and
hired
him
this
driver
was
cool
intrepid
and
inured
to
every
peril
at
an
old
along
the
route
he
found
relays
of
mules
that
belonged
to
the
at
last
a
great
whoop
and
yell
such
as
was
peculiar
to
the
custers
was
answered
by
the
general
and
made
me
aware
for
the
first
time
that
colonel
tom
was
outside
i
scolded
him
for
coming
before
i
thanked
him
but
he
made
light
of
the
danger
and
hurried
us
to
get
ready
fearing
a
coming
blizzard
his
arms
were
full
of
wraps
and
his
pockets
crowded
with
mufflers
and
wraps
the
ladies
had
sent
out
to
me
we
did
ourselves
up
in
everything
we
had
while
the
three
hounds
were
being
placed
in
the
sleigh
the
drifts
were
too
deep
to
drive
near
the
cars
so
my
husband
carried
me
over
the
snow
and
deposited
me
in
the
straw
with
the
dogs
they
were
such
strangers
they
growled
at
being
crowded
then
the
two
brothers
followed
and
thus
packed
in
we
began
that
terrible
ride
amid
the
cheers
of
those
we
were
leaving
it
was
understood
that
we
were
to
send
back
help
to
those
we
left
the
suspense
and
alarm
in
the
car
had
been
great
but
that
journey
through
the
drifts
was
simply
terrible
i
tried
to
be
courageous
and
did
manage
to
keep
still
but
every
time
we
plunged
into
what
appeared
to
be
a
bottomless
white
abyss
i
believed
that
we
were
to
be
buried
there
and
so
we
would
have
been
i
firmly
believe
had
it
not
been
for
the
experience
and
tenacity
of
will
shown
by
the
old
driver
he
had
a
peculiar
yell
that
he
reserved
for
supreme
moments
and
that
always
incited
the
floundering
mules
to
new
efforts
the
sleigh
was
covered
but
i
could
look
out
in
front
and
see
the
plucky
creatures
scrambling
up
a
bank
after
they
had
extricated
us
from
the
great
drift
at
the
bottom
of
the
gully
if
there
had
been
a
tree
to
guide
us
or
had
it
been
daytime
it
would
not
have
seemed
so
hopeless
a
journey
the
moon
was
waning
and
the
clouds
obscured
it
entirely
from
time
to
time
there
was
nothing
to
serve
as
except
the
sometimes
we
had
to
leave
them
to
find
a
road
where
the
sleigh
could
be
pulled
through
and
i
believed
we
never
would
reach
them
again
divide
after
divide
stretched
before
us
like
the
illimitable
waves
of
a
great
white
sea
the
snow
never
ceased
falling
and
i
knew
too
much
of
the
dakota
blizzard
not
to
fear
hourly
that
it
would
settle
into
that
driving
blinding
whirling
atmosphere
through
which
no
eyes
can
penetrate
and
no
foot
progress
it
is
fortunate
that
such
hours
of
suspense
come
to
an
end
before
one
is
driven
distracted
when
at
last
i
saw
the
light
shining
out
of
our
door
at
fort
lincoln
i
could
not
speak
for
joy
and
gratitude
at
our
release
from
such
peril
our
friends
gathered
about
us
around
the
great
in
the
general
s
room
no
light
ever
seemed
so
bright
no
haven
ever
so
blessed
as
our
own
fireside
the
train
remained
in
the
spot
where
we
had
left
it
until
the
sun
of
the
next
spring
melted
down
the
great
ice
banks
and
set
free
the
buried
engines
all
the
help
that
bismarck
could
give
was
sent
out
at
once
and
even
the
few
cattle
that
survived
were
at
last
driven
over
that
long
distance
and
shelter
found
for
them
in
the
town
hardly
had
we
arrived
before
a
despatch
came
recalling
the
general
to
the
east
i
had
no
thought
but
that
i
would
be
allowed
to
accompany
him
and
went
at
once
to
repack
my
things
my
husband
found
me
thus
employed
and
took
my
breath
away
by
telling
me
he
could
not
endure
the
anxiety
of
having
me
go
through
such
peril
again
in
vain
i
pleaded
and
asked
him
to
remember
that
i
had
summoned
sufficient
not
to
utter
a
word
about
my
fears
i
promised
more
courage
the
next
time
it
was
of
no
avail
i
had
to
submit
not
the
shadow
of
an
anxiety
nor
the
faintest
sign
of
dread
of
the
coming
journey
over
the
snow
again
came
into
his
face
he
left
me
with
the
same
words
with
which
he
always
comforted
me
be
sure
libbie
it
s
all
for
the
best
you
know
we
always
find
it
so
in
the
with
these
farewell
words
he
stepped
into
the
sleigh
which
he
knew
well
might
be
his
tomb
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
speak
in
detail
of
the
days
that
followed
life
seemed
insupportable
until
i
received
a
despatch
saying
that
my
husband
had
again
passed
safely
over
that
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
of
country
where
every
hour
life
is
in
jeopardy
chapter
xxix
our
life
s
last
chapter
our
women
s
hearts
fell
when
the
fiat
went
forth
that
there
was
to
be
a
summer
campaign
with
probably
actual
fighting
with
indians
sitting
bull
refused
to
make
a
treaty
with
the
government
and
would
not
come
in
to
live
on
a
reservation
besides
his
constant
attacks
on
the
white
settlers
driving
back
even
the
most
adventurous
he
was
incessantly
invading
and
stealing
from
the
land
assigned
to
the
peaceable
crows
they
appealed
for
help
to
the
government
that
had
promised
to
shield
them
the
preparations
for
the
expedition
were
completed
before
my
husband
returned
from
the
east
whither
he
had
been
ordered
the
troops
had
been
sent
out
of
barracks
into
a
camp
that
was
established
a
short
distance
down
the
valley
as
soon
as
the
general
returned
we
left
home
and
went
into
camp
the
morning
for
the
start
came
only
too
soon
my
husband
was
to
take
sister
margaret
and
me
out
for
the
first
day
s
march
so
i
rode
beside
him
out
of
camp
the
column
that
followed
seemed
unending
the
grass
was
not
then
suitable
for
grazing
and
as
the
route
of
travel
was
through
a
barren
country
immense
quantities
of
forage
had
to
be
transported
the
wagons
themselves
seemed
to
stretch
out
interminably
there
were
the
ponies
already
laden
and
cavalry
artillery
and
infantry
followed
the
cavalry
being
in
advance
of
all
the
number
of
men
citizens
employés
indian
scouts
and
soldiers
was
about
twelve
hundred
there
were
nearly
seventeen
hundred
animals
in
all
as
we
rode
at
the
head
of
the
column
we
were
the
first
to
enter
the
confines
of
the
garrison
about
the
indian
quarters
which
we
were
obliged
to
pass
stood
the
squaws
the
old
men
and
the
children
singing
or
rather
moaning
a
minor
tune
that
has
been
uttered
on
the
going
out
of
indian
warriors
since
time
immemorial
some
of
the
squaws
crouched
on
the
ground
too
burdened
with
their
trouble
to
hold
up
their
heads
others
restrained
the
restless
children
who
discerning
their
fathers
sought
to
follow
them
the
indian
scouts
themselves
beat
their
drums
and
kept
up
their
peculiar
monotonous
tune
which
is
weird
and
melancholy
beyond
description
their
is
misnamed
when
called
music
it
is
more
of
a
lament
or
a
dirge
than
an
inspiration
to
activity
this
intoning
they
kept
up
for
miles
along
the
road
after
we
had
passed
the
indian
quarters
we
came
near
laundress
row
and
there
my
heart
entirely
failed
me
the
wives
and
children
of
the
soldiers
lined
the
road
mothers
with
streaming
eyes
held
their
little
ones
out
at
arm
for
one
last
look
at
the
departing
father
the
toddlers
among
the
children
unnoticed
by
their
elders
had
made
a
mimic
column
of
their
own
with
their
handkerchiefs
tied
to
sticks
in
lieu
of
flags
and
beating
old
tin
pans
for
drums
they
strode
lustily
back
and
forth
in
imitation
of
the
advancing
soldiers
they
were
fortunately
too
young
to
realize
why
the
mothers
wailed
out
their
farewells
unfettered
by
conventional
restrictions
and
indifferent
to
the
opinion
of
others
the
grief
of
these
women
was
audible
and
was
accompanied
by
desponding
gestures
dictated
by
their
bursting
hearts
and
expressions
of
their
abandoned
grief
it
was
a
relief
to
escape
from
them
and
enter
the
garrison
and
yet
when
our
band
struck
up
the
girl
i
left
behind
me
the
most
despairing
hour
seemed
to
have
come
all
the
wives
of
the
officers
who
had
forced
themselves
to
their
doors
to
try
and
wave
a
courageous
farewell
and
smile
bravely
to
keep
the
ones
they
loved
from
knowing
the
anguish
of
their
breaking
hearts
gave
up
the
struggle
at
the
sound
of
the
music
the
first
notes
made
them
disappear
to
fight
out
alone
their
trouble
and
seek
to
place
their
hands
in
that
of
their
heavenly
father
who
at
such
supreme
hours
was
their
solace
from
the
hour
of
breaking
camp
before
the
sun
was
up
a
mist
had
enveloped
everything
soon
the
bright
sun
began
to
penetrate
this
veil
and
dispel
the
haze
and
a
scene
of
wonder
and
beauty
appeared
the
cavalry
and
infantry
in
the
order
named
the
scouts
and
artillery
and
behind
all
the
long
line
of
wagons
made
a
column
altogether
some
two
miles
in
length
as
the
sun
broke
through
the
mist
a
mirage
appeared
which
took
up
about
half
of
the
line
of
cavalry
and
thenceforth
for
a
little
distance
it
marched
equally
plain
to
the
sight
on
the
earth
and
in
the
sky
the
future
of
the
heroic
band
whose
days
were
even
then
numbered
seemed
to
be
revealed
and
already
there
seemed
a
premonition
in
the
supernatural
translation
as
their
forms
were
reflected
from
the
opaque
mist
of
the
early
dawn
the
sun
mounting
higher
and
higher
as
we
advanced
took
every
little
bit
of
burnished
steel
on
the
arms
and
equipments
along
the
line
of
horsemen
and
turned
them
into
glittering
flashes
of
radiating
light
the
yellow
indicative
of
cavalry
outlined
the
accoutrements
the
trappings
of
the
saddle
and
sometimes
a
narrow
thread
of
that
effective
tint
followed
the
outlines
even
up
to
the
of
the
bridle
at
every
bend
of
the
road
as
the
column
wound
its
way
round
and
round
the
low
hills
my
husband
glanced
back
to
admire
his
men
and
could
not
refrain
from
constantly
calling
my
attention
to
their
grand
appearance
the
soldiers
inured
to
many
years
of
hardship
were
the
perfection
of
physical
manhood
their
brawny
limbs
and
lithe
bodies
gave
proof
of
the
training
their
life
had
given
their
resolute
faces
brave
and
confident
inspired
one
with
a
feeling
that
they
were
going
out
aware
of
the
momentous
hours
awaiting
them
but
inwardly
assured
of
their
capability
to
meet
them
the
general
could
scarcely
restrain
his
recurring
joy
at
being
again
with
his
regiment
from
which
he
had
feared
he
might
be
separated
by
being
detained
on
other
duty
his
buoyant
spirits
at
the
prospect
of
the
activity
and
that
he
so
loved
made
him
like
a
boy
he
had
made
every
plan
to
have
me
join
him
later
on
when
they
should
have
reached
the
yellowstone
the
steamers
with
supplies
would
be
obliged
to
leave
our
post
and
follow
the
missouri
up
to
the
mouth
of
the
yellowstone
and
from
thence
on
to
the
point
on
that
river
where
the
regiment
was
to
make
its
first
halt
to
renew
the
rations
and
forage
he
was
sanguine
that
but
a
few
weeks
would
elapse
before
we
would
be
reunited
and
used
this
argument
to
animate
me
with
courage
to
meet
our
separation
as
usual
we
rode
a
little
in
advance
and
selected
camp
and
watched
the
approach
of
the
regiment
with
real
pride
they
were
so
accustomed
to
the
march
the
line
hardly
diverged
from
the
trail
there
was
a
unity
of
movement
about
them
that
made
the
column
at
a
distance
seem
like
a
broad
dark
ribbon
stretched
smoothly
over
the
plains
we
made
our
camp
the
first
night
on
a
small
river
a
few
miles
beyond
the
post
there
the
paymaster
made
his
disbursements
in
order
that
the
debts
of
the
soldiers
might
be
liquidated
with
the
sutler
in
the
morning
the
farewell
was
said
and
the
paymaster
took
sister
and
me
back
to
the
post
with
my
husband
s
departure
my
last
happy
days
in
garrison
were
ended
as
a
premonition
of
disaster
that
i
had
never
known
before
weighed
me
down
i
could
not
shake
off
the
baleful
influence
of
depressing
thoughts
this
presentiment
and
suspense
such
as
i
had
never
known
made
me
selfish
and
i
shut
into
my
heart
the
most
uncontrollable
anxiety
and
could
lighten
no
one
else
s
burden
the
occupations
of
other
summers
could
not
even
give
temporary
interest
we
heard
constantly
at
the
fort
of
the
disaffection
of
the
young
indians
of
the
reservation
and
of
their
joining
the
hostiles
we
knew
for
we
had
seen
for
ourselves
how
admirably
they
were
equipped
we
even
saw
on
a
steamer
touching
at
our
landing
its
freight
of
springfield
rifles
piled
up
on
the
decks
for
the
indians
up
the
river
there
was
unquestionable
proof
that
they
came
into
the
far
above
us
and
bought
them
while
our
own
brave
cavalry
troopers
were
sent
out
with
only
the
carbines
that
grew
foul
after
the
second
firing
while
we
waited
in
untold
suspense
for
some
hopeful
news
the
garrison
was
suddenly
thrown
into
a
state
of
excitement
by
important
despatches
that
were
sent
from
division
in
the
east
we
women
knew
that
eventful
news
had
come
and
could
hardly
restrain
our
curiosity
for
it
was
of
vital
import
to
us
indian
scouts
were
fitted
out
at
the
fort
with
the
greatest
despatch
and
given
instructions
to
make
the
utmost
speed
they
could
in
reaching
the
expedition
on
the
yellowstone
after
their
departure
when
there
was
no
longer
any
need
for
secrecy
we
were
told
that
the
expedition
which
had
started
from
the
department
of
the
platte
and
encountered
the
hostile
indians
on
the
of
the
rosebud
had
been
compelled
to
retreat
all
those
victorious
indians
had
gone
to
join
sitting
bull
and
it
was
to
warn
our
regiment
that
this
news
was
sent
to
our
post
which
was
the
extreme
telegraphic
communication
in
the
and
the
orders
given
to
transmit
the
information
that
precautions
might
be
taken
against
encountering
so
large
a
number
of
the
enemy
the
news
of
the
failure
of
the
campaign
in
the
other
department
was
a
to
our
hopes
we
felt
that
we
had
nothing
to
expect
but
that
our
troops
would
be
overwhelmed
with
numbers
for
it
seemed
to
us
an
impossibility
as
it
really
proved
to
be
that
our
indian
scouts
should
cross
that
vast
extent
of
country
in
time
to
make
the
warning
of
use
the
first
steamer
that
returned
from
the
yellowstone
brought
letters
from
my
husband
with
the
permission
for
which
i
had
longed
unutterably
to
join
him
by
the
next
boat
the
indians
had
fired
into
the
steamer
when
it
had
passed
under
the
high
bluffs
in
the
gorges
of
the
river
i
counted
the
hours
until
the
second
steamer
was
ready
they
were
obliged
after
loading
to
cover
the
and
other
vulnerable
portions
of
the
upper
deck
with
to
repel
attacks
then
were
placed
around
the
guards
as
protection
and
other
precautions
taken
for
the
safety
of
those
on
board
all
these
delays
and
preparations
made
me
inexpressibly
impatient
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
time
would
never
come
for
the
steamer
to
depart
meanwhile
our
own
post
was
constantly
surrounded
by
hostiles
and
the
outer
pickets
were
continually
subjected
to
attacks
it
was
no
unusual
sound
to
hear
the
calling
out
the
infantry
before
dawn
to
defend
the
garrison
we
saw
the
faces
of
the
officers
blanch
brave
as
they
were
when
the
savages
grew
so
bold
as
to
make
a
daytime
sortie
upon
our
outer
guards
a
picture
of
one
day
of
our
life
in
those
disconsolate
times
is
fixed
indelibly
in
my
memory
on
sunday
afternoon
the
of
june
our
little
group
of
saddened
women
borne
down
with
one
common
weight
of
anxiety
sought
solace
in
gathering
together
in
our
house
we
tried
to
find
some
slight
surcease
from
trouble
in
the
old
hymns
some
of
them
dated
back
to
our
childhood
s
days
when
our
mothers
rocked
us
to
sleep
to
their
soothing
strains
i
remember
the
grief
with
which
one
fair
young
wife
threw
herself
on
the
carpet
and
pillowed
her
head
in
the
lap
of
a
tender
friend
another
sat
dejected
at
the
piano
and
struck
soft
chords
that
melted
into
the
notes
of
the
voices
all
were
absorbed
in
the
same
thoughts
and
their
eyes
were
filled
with
visions
and
longings
indescribable
yearning
for
the
absent
and
untold
terror
for
their
safety
engrossed
each
heart
the
words
of
the
hymn
e
en
though
a
cross
it
be
nearer
my
god
to
thee
came
forth
with
almost
a
sob
from
every
throat
at
that
very
hour
the
fears
that
our
tortured
minds
had
portrayed
in
imagination
were
realities
and
the
souls
of
those
we
thought
upon
were
ascending
to
meet
their
maker
on
the
of
july
for
it
took
that
time
for
the
news
to
come
the
sun
rose
on
a
beautiful
world
but
with
its
earliest
beams
came
the
first
knell
of
disaster
a
steamer
came
down
the
river
bearing
the
wounded
from
the
battle
of
the
little
big
horn
of
sunday
june
this
battle
wrecked
the
lives
of
women
at
fort
lincoln
and
orphaned
children
of
officers
and
soldiers
joined
their
cry
to
that
of
their
bereaved
mothers
from
that
time
the
life
went
out
of
the
hearts
of
the
women
who
weep
and
god
asked
them
to
walk
on
alone
and
in
the
shadow
custer
very
naturally
ends
her
work
with
the
coming
of
the
news
that
put
so
many
women
s
lives
in
shadow
she
has
attempted
no
account
of
the
little
big
horn
expedition
and
none
seems
necessary
here
but
it
is
deemed
best
to
add
the
following
very
brief
outline
by
way
of
explanation
to
any
reader
whose
memory
may
need
refreshing
the
expedition
during
the
summer
of
which
ended
so
fatally
with
the
battle
of
the
little
big
horn
was
under
general
terry
the
ranking
officer
general
custer
commanded
under
him
the
cavalry
as
it
marched
the
force
struck
a
fresh
indian
trail
and
scouts
were
sent
to
follow
it
up
and
ascertain
the
number
of
warriors
in
the
band
this
can
be
done
with
great
accuracy
the
number
of
indians
can
be
estimated
by
following
the
trail
far
enough
to
get
its
average
width
and
the
size
of
the
circle
grazed
over
at
night
by
the
ponies
on
which
the
warriors
ride
in
this
case
the
scouts
followed
the
trail
far
enough
to
ascertain
that
twelve
hundred
indians
were
in
the
band
but
did
not
learn
the
location
of
the
village
where
they
were
encamped
upon
their
return
general
terry
and
general
custer
consulted
together
it
was
well
known
to
them
that
the
vigilance
of
the
indian
keeps
outposts
and
on
every
thus
making
it
an
impossibility
to
approach
one
of
their
villages
unobserved
neither
could
it
be
kept
from
their
quick
eyes
what
the
strength
of
the
approaching
force
was
to
await
an
attack
or
to
advance
with
superior
numbers
was
to
give
the
indians
a
chance
to
escape
and
their
wariness
was
known
to
all
accordingly
it
was
determined
that
general
custer
should
take
such
force
as
he
thought
the
indians
seeing
him
approach
would
stand
against
awaiting
its
attack
he
was
convinced
that
the
cavalry
was
as
large
a
body
as
could
be
taken
with
safety
and
was
a
match
for
twelve
hundred
indians
he
knew
his
men
and
knew
what
he
was
doing
it
was
suggested
that
he
should
take
a
piece
of
artillery
but
the
scouts
had
described
the
bad
lands
over
which
they
must
march
and
general
custer
knew
that
artillery
would
hamper
his
movements
besides
increasing
the
apparent
size
of
the
command
he
started
with
only
his
regiment
and
the
rest
of
the
expedition
halted
to
await
the
result
the
officers
and
men
went
out
feeling
certain
that
a
fight
awaited
them
if
there
had
been
but
twelve
hundred
warriors
as
there
was
every
reason
to
suppose
the
affair
would
have
ended
well
but
indian
reinforcements
covering
a
trail
half
a
mile
wide
as
was
learned
after
the
battle
had
come
from
the
north
and
in
an
opposite
direction
to
that
in
which
the
indians
were
going
instead
therefore
of
a
thousand
the
gallant
cavalry
encountered
about
five
thousand
indians
who
were
emboldened
by
success
in
their
battle
in
another
department
and
made
even
more
venturesome
by
their
increase
of
numbers
general
custer
called
a
halt
as
he
approached
the
village
and
summoning
his
officers
explained
to
them
his
plan
of
attack
which
was
the
same
that
had
proved
so
successful
in
the
battle
of
the
washita
in
the
previous
history
of
the
regiment
he
offered
the
lead
to
that
officer
who
should
first
report
his
company
ready
for
battle
in
a
few
seconds
one
of
the
highest
in
rank
received
this
desired
honor
dividing
the
command
into
three
detachments
general
custer
led
the
body
of
his
regiment
in
that
final
charge
in
which
afterwards
the
line
of
battle
of
a
portion
could
be
traced
by
the
dead
men
and
horses
as
they
fell
at
the
post
of
duty
and
from
which
no
man
escaped
appendix
the
yellowstone
expedition
of
from
letters
written
by
general
custer
to
his
wife
during
the
expedition
to
the
yellowstone
in
many
of
the
letters
from
which
the
following
extracts
are
taken
are
very
long
but
so
much
of
them
is
of
a
personal
nature
that
i
have
sought
here
to
give
only
those
portions
that
convey
an
idea
of
the
and
daily
experiences
of
a
campaign
on
the
frontier
i
regret
that
i
have
not
the
letters
giving
an
account
of
the
indian
fights
i
have
substituted
a
copy
of
general
custer
s
official
report
to
complete
the
story
of
the
summer
of
e
camp
on
heart
river
june
when
i
may
have
an
opportunity
to
send
this
or
when
it
may
reach
you
i
can
not
tell
but
i
will
have
it
ready
and
when
the
first
courier
leaves
he
shall
carry
these
tidings
to
you
this
is
our
sixth
day
out
from
fort
rice
we
reached
this
river
yesterday
about
noon
and
are
remaining
in
camp
as
it
is
somewhere
in
this
locality
that
we
expect
to
find
the
railroad
engineers
and
lieut
d
and
four
companies
of
infantry
that
left
fort
rice
before
you
did
our
march
has
been
perfectly
delightful
thus
far
we
have
encountered
no
indians
although
yesterday
we
saw
the
fresh
tracks
of
about
fifteen
ponies
showing
that
they
are
in
our
vicinity
i
never
saw
such
fine
hunting
as
we
have
constantly
had
since
we
left
fort
rice
i
have
done
some
of
the
best
shooting
i
ever
did
and
as
you
are
always
so
interested
i
want
to
tell
you
about
it
i
take
picked
men
with
me
and
generally
have
several
officers
in
the
party
besides
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
out
of
sight
of
the
column
as
the
game
is
so
abundant
we
can
even
eclipse
your
story
about
antelope
running
into
the
men
s
arms
they
actually
ran
through
our
and
one
was
run
over
by
a
wagon
and
caught
tom
b
immediately
remarked
well
by
george
we
can
beat
libbie
s
story
now
b
the
general
s
brother
the
first
day
out
the
dogs
caught
an
antelope
and
i
shot
one
since
when
i
have
brought
in
from
two
to
four
daily
day
before
yesterday
the
members
of
our
mess
killed
eight
antelope
but
i
must
tell
you
of
some
of
my
recent
shots
with
my
new
springfield
rifle
three
days
ago
f
and
i
with
a
party
were
out
in
sight
of
the
column
when
an
antelope
started
up
fully
two
hundred
yards
distant
and
ran
rapidly
parallel
to
us
i
fired
five
times
at
it
while
running
at
this
distance
it
then
stopped
and
i
got
about
paces
nearer
when
i
fired
aiming
directly
at
the
head
it
fell
and
i
measured
the
distance
which
proved
to
be
one
hundred
and
seventy
yards
and
the
antelope
was
found
to
be
shot
through
the
head
of
the
five
shots
which
i
had
fired
at
it
while
running
at
a
distance
of
two
hundred
yards
four
had
struck
the
antelope
one
breaking
its
thigh
and
two
going
through
its
body
yesterday
a
fine
large
buck
came
bounding
over
the
hill
across
our
path
he
was
so
far
that
no
one
seemed
to
think
it
worth
while
to
aim
at
him
but
i
thought
i
would
try
jumping
off
my
vic
in
an
instant
i
had
my
rifle
at
my
shoulder
and
levelled
at
the
buck
which
was
running
at
full
speed
i
pressed
the
trigger
and
waiting
an
instant
to
give
the
bullet
time
to
reach
its
mark
the
buck
was
seen
to
fall
lifeless
in
the
grass
to
be
accurate
in
the
distance
i
requested
f
to
measure
it
he
did
so
and
found
it
to
be
two
hundred
and
eighty
yards
galloping
to
where
the
antelope
had
fallen
i
found
him
shot
directly
through
the
centre
of
the
neck
about
one
foot
from
the
head
the
neck
being
broken
by
the
shot
i
put
him
entire
on
the
orderly
trumpeter
s
horse
and
sent
him
to
the
wagons
to
be
carried
to
camp
where
i
butchered
him
he
was
the
fattest
antelope
i
ever
saw
i
sent
h
and
m
s
messes
each
a
quarter
i
have
not
only
been
fortunate
enough
to
keep
our
own
mess
supplied
with
game
every
meal
since
we
left
fort
rice
but
have
had
quantities
to
send
to
the
infantry
officers
to
the
band
and
to
many
of
our
own
officers
poor
fred
and
tom
they
have
accompanied
me
frequently
fred
always
along
and
yet
neither
of
them
has
been
able
thus
far
to
kill
a
single
antelope
i
tease
them
a
great
deal
for
they
use
the
winchester
rifle
it
is
remarkably
accurate
up
to
one
hundred
yards
and
not
so
beyond
that
distance
you
know
when
tom
takes
a
notion
to
get
anything
of
mine
how
very
persistent
he
is
well
his
latest
dodge
is
to
obtain
possession
of
my
springfield
rifle
which
i
allow
my
orderly
tuttle
to
carry
night
before
last
he
carried
it
off
to
his
tent
without
saying
anything
about
it
but
tuttle
slipped
down
while
tom
was
at
breakfast
and
recaptured
the
rifle
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
one
of
our
coming
into
camp
a
few
days
ago
after
a
hunt
of
not
more
than
four
hours
in
sight
of
the
column
all
the
time
my
orderlies
and
i
had
four
antelope
strapped
to
our
saddles
then
came
captain
f
with
a
fine
large
buck
strapped
behind
him
and
a
saddle
in
his
front
while
his
orderly
was
similarly
loaded
then
mcd
and
his
orderly
each
with
a
splendid
antelope
on
his
saddle
while
others
of
the
men
who
had
accompanied
me
were
well
provided
with
game
except
poor
h
he
and
the
four
men
of
his
company
who
went
with
us
had
equal
chances
with
the
rest
but
they
had
nothing
the
officers
give
h
no
rest
now
on
the
subject
of
antelope
the
last
advice
given
him
was
that
his
only
chance
now
is
to
spread
his
which
the
officers
ridicule
him
for
bringing
into
such
a
country
as
this
and
catch
the
antelope
in
that
way
tuttle
killed
two
antelope
at
one
shot
with
my
springfield
at
pretty
long
range
yesterday
fred
and
i
had
an
exciting
time
with
an
elk
that
swam
the
river
twice
near
us
but
we
only
succeeded
in
wounding
him
before
he
got
away
to
the
bluffs
beyond
sight
of
the
command
where
we
did
not
deem
it
prudent
to
follow
him
i
am
glad
that
i
posted
myself
with
regard
to
taxidermy
for
yesterday
after
reaching
camp
i
devoted
all
the
afternoon
to
preparing
the
head
of
the
antelope
i
killed
for
preservation
the
antlers
the
officers
think
the
finest
they
ever
saw
i
have
prepared
the
entire
head
and
the
skin
of
about
one
foot
of
the
neck
i
also
have
a
beautiful
set
of
elk
antlers
that
i
hope
to
get
through
safely
i
carry
them
strapped
on
top
of
the
ambulance
of
mary
our
cook
i
do
not
think
we
are
going
to
have
any
serious
difficulty
with
the
indians
at
least
this
is
general
rosser
s
opinion
he
thinks
this
expedition
is
too
large
and
unwieldy
to
perform
the
desired
work
promptly
and
i
agree
with
him
there
is
an
officer
temporarily
detailed
with
the
command
who
inspires
my
respect
because
he
regards
the
wishes
of
his
mother
so
highly
he
has
some
fine
rifles
at
home
but
did
not
bring
any
with
him
merely
to
please
his
mother
who
feared
that
if
he
brought
his
guns
along
he
would
be
tempted
to
wander
off
alone
hunting
it
is
four
days
since
i
began
this
letter
but
we
have
been
moving
in
the
mean
while
so
that
but
little
opportunity
for
writing
has
been
allowed
with
the
ten
companies
of
the
i
started
to
join
the
engineers
leaving
the
infantry
and
train
to
follow
us
i
marched
thirty
miles
over
a
bad
country
besides
building
a
bridge
over
a
stream
thirty
feet
wide
and
ten
feet
deep
i
superintended
and
planned
it
and
about
one
hundred
and
eighty
men
worked
to
complete
it
about
twenty
men
had
to
cross
the
stream
before
the
bridge
could
be
begun
an
officer
must
go
with
them
so
i
detailed
mcd
and
twenty
of
his
men
they
had
to
strip
off
and
swim
across
you
ought
to
have
heard
the
young
officers
on
the
bank
hooting
at
mcd
when
he
was
preparing
to
lead
the
light
brigade
across
the
water
i
built
a
bridge
in
about
two
hours
over
which
the
whole
command
and
passed
the
officers
have
a
good
joke
on
lieut
h
nearly
all
of
them
have
killed
antelope
so
h
concluded
he
must
kill
his
he
went
out
yesterday
near
the
column
and
soon
espied
an
antelope
quietly
lying
in
the
grass
about
one
hundred
yards
distant
quickly
dismounting
from
his
horse
he
crawled
on
the
ground
until
near
enough
as
he
thought
to
kill
it
taking
deliberate
aim
he
fired
but
the
ball
fell
short
a
few
feet
yet
the
antelope
was
not
disturbed
this
is
not
unusual
again
he
took
aim
this
time
with
great
care
fired
and
to
his
joy
he
saw
the
fur
fly
from
the
antelope
never
doubting
but
that
he
had
given
him
a
mortal
wound
h
leaped
into
his
saddle
and
galloped
up
to
the
antelope
to
cut
its
throat
imagine
his
disgust
to
find
that
the
antelope
had
been
dead
several
days
and
had
already
been
taken
possession
of
by
the
flies
the
officers
will
never
let
him
hear
the
last
of
it
well
i
have
joined
the
engineers
and
am
having
such
pleasant
visits
with
general
rosser
we
talk
over
our
west
point
times
and
discuss
the
battles
of
the
war
i
stretch
the
under
the
fly
of
the
tent
and
there
in
the
moonlight
he
and
i
lying
at
full
length
listen
to
each
other
s
accounts
of
battles
in
which
both
had
borne
a
part
it
seemed
like
the
time
when
we
were
cadets
together
huddled
on
one
blanket
and
discussing
dreams
of
the
future
rosser
said
the
worst
whipping
he
had
during
the
war
was
the
one
i
gave
him
the
of
october
when
i
captured
everything
he
had
including
the
uniform
now
at
home
in
monroe
he
said
that
on
the
morning
of
that
fight
just
as
the
battle
was
commencing
he
was
on
a
hill
on
our
front
which
i
well
remember
watching
us
advance
he
was
looking
at
us
through
his
and
saw
and
recognized
me
as
plainly
as
if
i
had
been
by
his
side
i
was
at
the
head
of
my
troops
all
of
which
i
remember
and
advancing
to
the
attack
rosser
said
as
soon
as
he
recognized
me
he
sent
for
his
brigade
commanders
and
pointed
me
out
to
them
saying
do
you
see
that
man
in
front
with
long
hair
well
that
s
custer
and
we
must
bust
him
up
and
so
general
rosser
continued
we
would
have
done
had
you
attacked
us
as
we
thought
you
intended
to
but
instead
of
that
you
slipped
another
column
away
around
us
and
my
men
soon
began
calling
out
we
re
flanked
we
re
flanked
then
broke
and
ran
and
nothing
could
stop
rosser
wanted
to
meet
you
at
the
crossing
but
failed
and
wrote
to
his
wife
to
try
and
see
you
in
paul
but
you
had
already
gone
through
he
too
asked
if
you
did
not
accompany
me
almost
everywhere
so
you
see
what
an
extended
reputation
for
campaigning
you
have
and
do
you
know
he
tells
me
he
thinks
i
am
anxious
to
get
back
to
you
but
i
did
not
tell
him
that
i
was
already
counting
the
days
i
killed
another
antelope
yesterday
two
the
day
before
and
two
the
day
before
that
mary
made
us
a
delicious
out
of
two
curlew
i
shot
whenever
the
subject
of
comes
up
calhoun
tom
and
i
at
once
begin
talking
of
the
place
where
we
got
the
best
we
ever
tasted
one
will
say
i
ll
tell
you
where
you
can
get
the
very
nicest
you
ever
put
in
your
mouth
and
before
he
can
go
any
further
the
other
two
will
call
out
at
mother
i
saw
the
most
beautiful
yesterday
i
ever
have
seen
it
was
a
new
species
to
me
of
the
deepest
red
as
red
as
the
reddest
cow
you
ever
saw
i
was
too
far
away
to
get
a
shot
all
the
officers
were
up
at
my
tent
last
night
at
twilight
sitting
under
the
awning
in
front
all
jolly
all
full
of
their
jokes
and
prouder
than
ever
of
the
as
they
compared
the
regiment
with
the
infantry
this
letter
of
pages
would
make
a
article
so
far
as
its
length
goes
suppose
you
send
me
a
check
for
it
as
the
people
do
for
theirs
you
must
read
a
good
deal
of
it
to
mother
or
tell
her
of
its
contents
and
say
that
this
time
this
letter
must
do
for
the
family
i
hope
your
going
home
will
be
a
comfort
to
her
and
improve
her
health
tell
d
if
she
is
going
to
come
into
the
custer
family
she
must
be
prepared
to
receive
little
something
the
size
of
this
volume
tom
says
tell
libbie
i
intended
writing
but
when
i
saw
the
length
of
this
letter
i
knew
that
there
was
nothing
left
to
tell
her
yellowstone
river
july
well
here
we
are
encamped
on
the
banks
of
the
and
to
you
far
distant
yellowstone
how
i
have
longed
to
have
you
see
during
our
progress
what
seems
to
me
almost
like
another
world
truly
can
this
interesting
region
be
termed
the
when
the
command
arrived
at
what
was
supposed
to
be
a
distance
of
about
fifteen
miles
from
the
river
it
became
necessary
and
important
to
ascertain
where
the
steamboat
with
supplies
that
had
come
by
river
was
located
i
volunteered
to
go
on
a
steamboat
hunt
as
i
had
hunted
almost
every
other
species
of
game
so
taking
two
troops
and
leaving
our
tents
and
wagons
i
started
on
a
search
for
the
several
of
the
officers
applied
to
go
and
general
rosser
who
is
always
ready
for
a
trip
of
this
kind
accepted
my
invitation
to
accompany
us
no
artist
not
even
a
church
or
a
bierstadt
could
fairly
represent
the
wonderful
country
we
passed
over
while
each
step
of
our
progress
was
like
each
successive
shifting
of
the
kaleidoscope
presenting
to
our
wondering
gaze
views
which
almost
appalled
us
by
their
sublimity
we
passed
over
a
region
so
full
of
cañons
and
precipices
much
of
our
journey
was
necessarily
made
on
foot
our
horses
being
led
in
single
file
except
my
own
noble
he
seemed
to
realize
the
difficulties
of
the
route
and
although
permitted
to
run
untethered
he
followed
me
as
closely
and
carefully
as
a
dog
sometimes
we
found
ourselves
on
the
summit
of
a
high
peak
to
ascend
which
we
had
to
risk
both
life
and
limb
and
particularly
imperil
the
safety
of
our
horses
once
we
came
to
a
steep
declivity
which
neither
man
nor
horse
could
descend
it
was
impossible
to
retrace
our
steps
as
the
sides
of
the
peak
were
so
steep
our
horses
could
not
turn
about
without
great
danger
of
tumbling
hundreds
of
feet
asking
the
rest
to
wait
a
moment
i
looked
about
and
discovered
a
possible
way
out
to
our
left
provided
a
huge
rock
which
lay
in
the
path
could
be
removed
bidding
tuttle
look
out
and
uttering
a
few
words
of
caution
to
dandy
who
seemed
to
comprehend
our
situation
and
say
all
right
don
t
mind
me
i
left
him
clinging
to
the
soft
and
yielding
soil
of
the
mountain
i
succeeded
in
dislodging
the
rock
after
some
work
and
sent
it
leaping
down
the
rocky
side
leading
to
the
valley
sometimes
taking
hundreds
of
feet
at
one
plunge
the
way
being
clear
a
simple
come
on
dandy
and
we
took
the
advance
followed
by
the
rest
we
were
well
repaid
for
our
risk
and
trouble
by
the
grandeur
of
the
scenery
that
lay
spread
out
beneath
us
i
am
making
a
rare
collection
of
the
fossils
that
the
country
is
rich
in
vegetable
and
mineral
specimens
i
hope
you
will
approve
of
my
plan
of
disposal
of
them
i
intend
to
give
them
to
the
college
at
ann
arbor
what
would
you
think
to
pass
through
thousands
of
acres
of
petrified
trees
some
of
which
are
twelve
feet
in
diameter
with
trunks
and
branches
perfect
the
fallen
trunks
of
some
as
they
lie
on
the
ground
are
so
natural
in
grain
and
color
the
officers
are
sometimes
deceived
and
sit
down
thinking
them
but
lately
felled
to
return
to
my
search
for
the
steamboat
after
struggling
through
the
beds
of
deep
cañons
and
climbing
almost
inaccessible
peaks
we
finally
emerged
into
the
valley
of
the
yellowstone
we
were
still
obliged
in
crossing
swales
to
struggle
on
by
walking
leading
climbing
and
stumbling
and
after
a
ride
of
ten
miles
we
came
to
where
the
boat
was
moored
every
one
is
congratulating
f
on
getting
the
place
i
applied
to
rosser
for
as
a
member
of
the
party
of
engineers
he
will
get
a
month
and
a
prospect
later
of
advancement
and
higher
salary
it
is
such
a
pleasure
when
i
can
help
young
men
who
evince
a
disposition
to
help
themselves
i
never
forget
those
who
gave
me
my
first
encouragement
in
life
how
i
have
wished
that
some
of
our
home
boys
who
possess
talent
and
education
but
lack
means
and
opportunity
would
cast
themselves
loose
from
home
and
try
their
fortunes
in
this
great
enterprising
western
country
where
the
virtues
of
real
manhood
come
quickly
to
the
surface
and
their
possessor
finds
himself
transformed
from
a
mere
boy
to
a
man
almost
before
he
realizes
his
quick
advancement
it
is
such
a
comfort
to
me
to
feel
independent
much
as
i
dote
on
my
profession
and
earnestly
as
i
am
devoted
to
it
yet
should
accident
cast
me
adrift
and
i
be
thrown
upon
my
own
resources
i
have
not
a
fear
but
that
energy
and
a
willingness
to
put
my
shoulder
to
the
wheel
would
carry
me
through
and
with
reasonable
success
in
this
country
no
man
particularly
if
moderately
educated
need
fail
in
life
if
determined
to
succeed
so
many
and
varied
are
the
avenues
to
honorable
employment
which
open
on
all
hands
before
him
the
climate
is
perfect
out
here
not
five
men
are
sick
out
of
the
whole
ten
troops
and
one
poor
fellow
who
was
about
to
be
discharged
before
we
left
for
disability
as
he
was
thought
to
be
in
consumption
is
now
well
and
does
not
desire
his
discharge
though
it
is
july
we
sleep
under
blankets
constantly
regarding
the
dogs
i
find
myself
more
warmly
attached
to
tuck
than
to
any
other
i
have
ever
owned
did
i
tell
you
of
her
catching
a
and
pulling
him
down
after
a
run
of
over
a
mile
in
which
she
left
the
other
dogs
far
behind
she
comes
to
me
almost
every
evening
when
i
am
sitting
in
my
large
listening
to
the
band
or
joining
with
the
officers
in
conversation
first
she
lays
her
head
on
my
knee
as
if
to
ask
if
i
am
too
much
engaged
to
notice
her
a
pat
of
encouragement
and
her
are
thrown
lightly
across
my
lap
a
few
moments
in
this
posture
and
she
lifts
her
from
the
ground
and
great
dog
that
she
is
quietly
and
gently
disposes
of
herself
on
my
lap
and
at
times
will
cuddle
down
and
sleep
there
for
an
hour
at
a
time
until
i
become
so
tired
of
my
charge
that
i
am
compelled
to
transfer
her
to
mother
earth
and
even
then
she
resembles
a
for
and
child
who
can
never
be
induced
to
retire
until
it
has
been
fondled
to
sleep
in
its
mother
s
arms
tuck
will
sleep
so
soundly
in
my
lap
that
i
can
transfer
her
gently
to
the
ground
and
she
will
continue
her
slumber
like
a
little
baby
carefully
deposited
in
its
crib
as
i
write
she
is
lying
at
my
feet
she
makes
up
with
no
other
person
i
have
just
told
tom
if
he
expects
letters
from
you
he
must
write
first
he
answers
that
he
would
like
to
know
what
he
can
find
to
write
after
she
receives
that
from
and
one
might
think
that
the
eighty
pages
of
this
letter
had
exhausted
every
subject
but
there
is
much
i
must
leave
untold
i
am
prouder
and
prouder
of
the
libbie
not
an
officer
or
man
of
my
command
has
been
seen
intoxicated
since
the
expedition
left
fort
rice
h
and
i
have
our
periodical
official
tussles
as
usual
but
i
see
a
great
deal
of
him
and
like
him
better
than
ever
we
have
just
parted
with
a
member
of
the
expedition
who
is
not
a
loss
to
us
for
he
is
a
gossip
but
not
viciously
inclined
rather
the
contrary
he
peddles
tiresome
tales
without
meaning
harm
everybody
in
the
cavalry
camp
is
content
to
attend
to
his
own
business
and
not
meddle
with
other
people
s
affairs
you
will
scarcely
credit
what
i
am
about
to
tell
you
but
it
is
an
undeniable
fact
here
we
have
been
encamped
for
several
days
with
pickets
and
guards
surrounding
our
camp
for
its
protection
our
march
here
was
over
a
stretch
of
wild
almost
unknown
country
supposed
to
be
infested
with
hostile
indians
small
parties
were
not
deemed
safe
beyond
sight
of
our
column
and
yet
imagine
our
surprise
to
see
a
plain
white
covered
drawn
by
two
mules
and
accompanied
by
a
single
individual
approach
our
camp
from
the
direction
we
came
more
than
one
week
ago
it
proved
to
be
the
of
an
humble
priest
who
leaving
fort
rice
seven
days
ago
traversed
alone
and
unguided
except
by
our
trail
through
more
than
two
hundred
miles
of
hostile
and
dangerous
country
fording
rivers
winding
through
deep
and
almost
impassable
cañons
toiling
over
mountains
at
each
step
liable
to
be
massacred
by
hostile
indians
the
country
was
entirely
new
to
him
he
never
having
been
west
of
fort
rice
before
he
came
believing
he
could
be
of
spiritual
benefit
to
many
who
would
otherwise
be
wholly
deprived
of
such
comfort
he
carried
no
arms
adopted
no
special
precautions
for
his
safety
but
with
a
simple
and
unpretentious
cross
reverently
erected
and
borne
above
his
he
took
his
life
in
his
hand
and
boldly
plunged
into
the
wilds
of
this
almost
unknown
region
evidently
relying
upon
him
who
ruleth
over
all
to
guide
and
protect
him
in
his
perilous
journey
this
to
me
is
an
act
of
christian
heroism
and
physical
courage
which
entitles
this
humble
priest
to
immeasurable
honor
and
praise

within
an
hour
we
expected
to
have
an
opportunity
to
write

as
the

five

a

it
is
important
to
discharge

as
soon
as
practicable
the

is
not
in

yet
i
took
a

and
started
ahead
to
find

road
you
have
no
idea
what
difficulty
we
have
looking
out
a
route
through
this
country
over
which
it
is
possible
to
move
a

yesterday
i
took
two
companies
and
travelled
about
forty
miles
we
reached

we
have
been
sleeping
since
and
it
is
now
under
the
large
trees
standing
on

have
just
received

are

i
am
sorry
i
am
compelled
to
write
under
such
hurried
circumstances
i
am
lying
on

using
my
for
a

montana
assistant
yellowstone
sir
acting
under
the
instructions
of
the
commanding
i
proceeded
at
five
o
clock
on
the
morning
of
the
instant
with
one
squadron
of
my
command
numbering
about
ninety
men
to
explore
a
route
over
which
the
main
column
could
move
having
reached
a
point
on
the
yellowstone
river
near
the
mouth
of
tongue
river
and
several
miles
in
advance
and
while
waiting
the
arrival
of
the
forces
of
the
expedition
six
mounted
sioux
dashed
boldly
into
the
skirt
of
timber
within
which
my
command
had
halted
and
unsaddled
and
attempted
to
stampede
our
horses
fortunately
our
vedettes
discovered
the
approach
of
the
indians
in
time
to
give
the
alarm
a
few
shots
soon
drove
the
indians
to
a
safe
distance
where
they
kept
up
a
series
of
yells
occasionally
firing
a
few
shots
as
soon
as
the
squadron
could
mount
i
directed
captain
moylan
to
move
out
in
pursuit
at
the
same
time
i
moved
with
the
troops
in
advance
commanded
by
first
lieutenant
custer
following
the
indians
at
a
brisk
gait
my
suspicions
became
excited
by
the
confident
bearing
exhibited
by
the
six
sioux
in
our
front
whose
course
seemed
to
lead
us
near
a
heavy
growth
of
timber
which
stood
along
the
river
bank
above
us
when
almost
within
rifle
range
of
this
timber
i
directed
the
squadron
to
halt
while
i
with
two
orderlies
all
being
well
mounted
continued
after
the
sioux
in
order
to
develop
their
intentions
proceeding
a
few
hundred
yards
in
advance
of
the
squadron
and
keeping
a
watchful
eye
on
the
timber
to
my
left
i
halted
the
six
indians
in
my
front
also
halted
as
if
to
tempt
farther
pursuit
finding
all
efforts
in
this
direction
unavailing
their
plans
and
intentions
were
quickly
made
evident
as
no
sooner
was
it
seen
that
we
intended
to
advance
no
farther
than
with
their
characteristic
howls
and
yells
over
three
hundred
warriors
dashed
in
perfect
line
from
the
edge
of
the
timber
and
charged
down
upon
captain
moylan
s
squadron
at
the
same
time
endeavoring
to
intercept
the
small
party
with
me
as
soon
as
the
speed
of
the
on
which
i
was
mounted
brought
me
within
hailing
distance
of
lieutenant
custer
s
troop
i
directed
that
officer
to
quickly
throw
forward
a
dismounted
line
of
troopers
and
endeavor
to
empty
a
few
indian
saddles
the
order
was
obeyed
with
the
greatest
alacrity
and
as
the
sioux
came
dashing
forward
expecting
to
ride
down
the
squadron
a
line
of
dismounted
cavalrymen
rose
from
the
grass
and
delivered
almost
in
the
faces
of
the
warriors
a
volley
of
carbine
bullets
which
broke
and
scattered
their
ranks
in
all
directions
and
sent
more
than
one
sioux
reeling
from
his
saddle
this
check
gave
us
time
to
make
our
dispositions
to
resist
the
succeeding
attacks
which
we
knew
our
enemies
would
soon
make
upon
us
the
great
superiority
of
our
enemies
in
numbers
the
long
distance
separating
us
from
the
main
command
and
the
belief
afterwards
verified
that
the
woods
above
us
still
concealed
a
portion
of
the
savage
forces
induced
me
to
confine
my
movements
at
first
strictly
to
the
defensive
the
entire
squadron
except
the
was
dismounted
and
ordered
to
fight
on
foot
the
indians
outnumbering
us
almost
five
to
one
were
enabled
to
envelop
us
completely
between
their
lines
formed
in
a
semicircle
and
the
river
which
flowed
at
our
backs
the
little
belt
of
timber
in
which
we
had
been
first
attacked
formed
a
very
good
cover
for
our
while
the
crest
of
a
second
conveniently
located
from
the
timber
gave
us
an
excellent
line
of
defence
the
length
of
our
line
and
the
numbers
of
the
enemy
prevented
us
from
having
any
force
in
reserve
every
available
officer
and
man
was
on
the
which
was
in
reality
our
line
of
battle
even
the
number
of
men
holding
horses
had
to
be
reduced
so
that
each
held
eight
horses
until
the
indians
were
made
to
taste
quite
freely
of
our
lead
they
displayed
unusual
boldness
frequently
charging
up
to
our
line
and
firing
with
great
deliberation
and
accuracy

the

who
acted
as

and

soon
after
private
charles
miller
of
a
troop
cavalry
succeeded
in
sending
a
carbine
bullet
directly
through
the
body
of
a
chief
who
had
been
conspicuous
throughout
the
engagement
at
the
same
time
it
was
known
that
our
firing
had
disabled
many
of
their
ponies
while
owing
to
our
sheltered
position
the
only
damage
thus
far
inflicted
upon
us
was
one
man
and
two
horses
wounded
one
of
the
latter
shot
in
three
places
finding
their
efforts
to
force
back
our
line
unavailing
the
indians
now
resorted
to
another
expedient
by
an
evidently
preconcerted
plan
they
set
fire
in
several
places
to
the
tall
grass
which
covered
the
ground
in
our
front
hoping
by
this
means
to
force
us
back
to
the
rear
and
thus
finish
us
at
their
pleasure
fortunately
for
us
there
was
no
wind
prevailing
at
the
time
while
the
grass
was
scarcely
dry
enough
to
burn
rapidly
taking
advantage
of
the
dense
curtain
of
smoke
which
rose
from
the
burning
grass
the
indians
by
following
the
course
of
the
flame
could
often
contrive
to
obtain
a
shot
at
us
at
comparatively
close
range
but
my
men
observing
that
there
was
no
danger
to
be
apprehended
from
the
slowly
advancing
flames
could
frequently
catch
an
opportunity
to
send
a
shot
through
a
break
in
the
curtain
of
smoke
and
in
this
way
surprised
the
indian
by
the
adoption
of
his
own
device
the
fight
began
at
and
was
waged
without
cessation
until
near
three
o
clock
all
efforts
of
the
indians
to
dislodge
us
proving
unsuccessful
the
indians
had
become
extremely
weary
and
had
almost
discontinued
their
offensive
movements
when
my
ammunition
ran
low
i
decided
to
mount
the
squadron
and
charge
the
indians
with
the
intention
of
driving
them
from
the
field
captain
moylan
promptly
had
his
men
in
the
saddle
and
throwing
forward
twenty
mounted
skirmishers
under
lieutenant
varnum
the
entire
squadron
moved
forward
at
a
trot
no
sooner
did
the
indians
discern
our
intentions
than
despite
their
superiority
in
numbers
they
cowardly
prepared
for
flight
in
which
preparation
they
were
greatly
hastened
when
captain
moylan
s
squadron
charged
them
and
drove
them
for
three
miles
five
ponies
killed
or
badly
wounded
were
left
on
the
or
along
the
line
of
their
flight
so
rapidly
were
they
forced
to
flee
that
they
abandoned
and
threw
away
arms
saddle
equipments
clothing
robes
lariats
and
other
articles
comprised
in
an
indian
outfit
among
the
indians
who
fought
us
on
this
occasion
were
some
of
the
identical
warriors
who
committed
the
massacre
at
fort
phil
kearney
and
they
no
doubt
intended
a
similar
programme
when
they
sent
the
six
warriors
to
dash
up
and
attempt
to
decoy
us
into
a
pursuit
past
the
timber
in
which
the
savages
hoped
to
ambush
us
had
we
pursued
the
six
warriors
half
a
mile
farther
instead
of
halting
the
entire
band
of
warriors
would
have
been
in
our
rear
and
all
the
advantage
of
position
and
numbers
would
have
been
with
them
so
far
as
the
troops
attacked
were
concerned
the
indians
to
offset
their
own
heavy
losses
had
been
able
to
do
us
no
damage
except
to
wound
one
man
and
two
horses
but
unfortunately
two
veterinary

cavalry
and
baliran
of
memphis
in
endeavoring
to
come
from
the
main
column
to
join
the
squadron
in
advance
were
discovered
by
the
indians
during
the
attack
and
being
unarmed
were
overtaken
and
killed
almost
within
view
of
the
fortunately
the
indians
were
so
pressed
as
not
to
be
able
to
scalp
or
otherwise
mutilate
the
remains
on
the
instant
we
discovered
the
trail
of
a
large
village
evidently
that
to
which
the
party
that
attacked
us
on
the
belonged
the
course
of
the
trail
led
up
the
yellowstone
and
apparently
was
not
more
than
two
days
old
acting
under
the
authority
of
the
commanding
i
ordered
my
command
consisting
of
four
squadrons
of
the
cavalry
in
readiness
to
begin
the
pursuit
that
night
the
also
directed
the
detachment
of
guides
and
indian
scouts
under
lieutenant
daniel
brush
infantry
to
report
to
me
for
temporary
service
leaving
all
tents
and
wagons
behind
and
taking
with
us
rations
for
seven
days
we
started
in
pursuit
at
ten
o
clock
on
the
night
of
the
instant
having
waited
until
that
hour
until
the
moon
should
enable
us
to
follow
the
trail
following
the
trail
as
rapidly
as
the
rough
character
of
the
country
would
permit
daylight
next
morning
found
us
nearly
thirty
miles
from
our
concealing
horses
and
men
in
a
ravine
a
halt
of
three
hours
was
ordered
to
enable
the
horses
to
graze
and
the
men
to
obtain
refreshments
renewing
the
march
at
eight
o
clock
the
pursuit
was
continued
without
halting
until
noon
when
to
avoid
discovery
as
well
as
to
obtain
needed
rest
for
men
and
animals
it
was
decided
to
conceal
ourselves
in
the
timber
and
await
the
cover
of
night
to
continue
the
pursuit
starting
out
at
the
trail
was
followed
rapidly
for
six
miles
when
to
our
disappointment
we
discovered
that
the
indians
had
taken
to
the
river
and
crossed
to
the
east
side
in
following
their
trail
to
this
point
it
was
evident
that
the
movement
of
the
indians
was
one
of
precipitate
flight
the
result
of
the
engagement
on
the
all
along
their
trail
and
in
their
were
to
be
found
large
quantities
of
what
constitutes
an
indian
s
equipments
such
as
robes
saddle
equipments
arms
and
cooking
utensils
in
a
hastily
abandoned
nearly
two
hundred
axes
besides
a
great
many
and
cups
were
found
my
entire
command
was
disappointed
when
the
trail
showed
that
the
indians
had
crossed
to
the
other
side
particularly
as
our
rapid
marching
had
carried
us
to
the
point
of
crossing
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
the
last
of
the
indians
had
crossed
over
so
that
one
more
march
would
have
enabled
us
to
overhaul
them
bivouacking
in
a
belt
of
timber
on
the
river
bank
we
waited
until
daylight
to
begin
an
attempt
to
cross
the
command
over
the
river
which
at
this
point
is
about
six
hundred
yards
wide
at
early
dawn
the
entire
command
forded
the
river
to
an
island
located
about
the
middle
of
the
channel
but
our
difficulties
in
the
way
of
crossing
here
began
as
the
volume
of
water
and
the
entire
force
of
the
current
were
to
be
encountered
between
the
island
and
the
opposite
bank
the
current
here
rushes
by
at
a
velocity
of
about
seven
miles
an
hour
while
the
depth
of
the
water
was
such
that
a
horse
attempting
to
cross
would
be
forced
to
swim
several
hundred
yards
still
as
we
knew
the
indians
had
not
discovered
our
pursuit
and
were
probably
located
within
easy
striking
distance
of
the
river
it
was
most
desirable
that
a
crossing
should
be
effected
to
accomplish
this
lieutenant
weston
cavalry
with
three
accomplished
swimmers
from
the
command
attempted
to
cross
on
a
carrying
with
them
a
cable
made
of
lariats
the
current
was
so
strong
that
lieutenant
weston
s
party
were
unable
to
effect
a
landing
but
were
swept
down
the
river
nearly
two
miles
and
then
forced
to
abandon
the
raft
and
swim
to
shore
lieutenant
weston
with
characteristic
perseverance
and
energy
made
repeated
attempts
afterwards
to
carry
the
cable
over
but
although
succeeding
in
reaching
the
opposite
bank
in
person
was
unable
to
connect
the
cable
with
the
shore
almost
the
entire
day
was
spent
in
these
unsuccessful
efforts
until
finally
a
crossing
in
this
manner
had
to
be
abandoned
i
then
caused
some
cattle
to
be
killed
and
by
stretching
the
hides
over
a
kind
of
prepared
by
the
crow
guide
made
what
are
known
among
the
indians
as
with
these
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
connect
a
cable
with
the
opposite
bank
at
daylight
next
morning
but
just
at
sunset
a
small
party
of
indians
were
seen
to
ride
down
to
the
bank
opposite
us
and
water
their
ponies
they
discovered
our
presence
and
at
once
hastened
away
of
course
it
was
useless
now
to
attempt
a
surprise
and
the
intention
to
cross
the
river
the
following
morning
was
abandoned
at
early
dawn
the
next
day
the
instant
the
indians
appeared
in
strong
force
on
the
river
bank
opposite
us
and
opened
a
brisk
fire
upon
us
from
their
rifles
no
attention
was
paid
to
them
until
encouraged
by
this
they
had
collected
at
several
points
in
full
view
and
within
range
of
our
rifles
when
about
thirty
of
our
best
marksmen
having
posted
themselves
along
the
bank
opened
a
fire
upon
the
indians
and
drove
them
back
to
cover
in
the
mean
time
strong
parties
of
indians
were
reported
by
our
pickets
to
be
crossing
the
river
below
and
above
us
their
ponies
and
themselves
being
so
accustomed
to
the
river
as
to
render
this
operation
quite
practicable
for
them
captain
french
commanding
the
right
wing
was
directed
to
watch
the
parties
crossing
below
while
colonel
hart
commanding
the
left
wing
posted
a
force
to
discharge
this
duty
with
regard
to
parties
crossing
above
it
would
have
been
possible
perhaps
for
us
to
have
prevented
the
indians
from
effecting
a
crossing
at
least
when
they
did
but
i
was
not
only
willing
but
anxious
that
as
many
of
them
should
come
over
as
were
so
disposed
they
were
soon
reported
as
moving
to
the
bluffs
immediately
in
rear
of
us
from
the
river
lieutenant
brush
was
directed
to
employ
his
scouts
in
watching
and
reporting
their
movements
a
duty
which
they
discharged
in
a
thorough
manner
while
this
was
transpiring
i
had
mounted
my
command
and
formed
it
in
line
close
under
the
bluffs
facing
from
the
river
where
we
quietly
waited
the
attack
of
the
indians
in
our
front
the
across
the
river
still
continued
the
indians
having
collected
some
of
their
best
shots
apparently
armed
with
rifles
and
were
attempting
to
drive
our
men
back
from
the
water
s
edge
it
was
at
this
time
that
my
standing
orderly
private
tuttle
of
e
troop
cavalry
one
of
the
best
marksmen
in
my
command
took
a
sporting
springfield
rifle
and
posted
himself
with
two
other
men
behind
cover
on
the
river
bank
and
began
picking
off
the
indians
as
they
exposed
themselves
on
the
opposite
bank
he
had
obtained
the
range
of
the
enemy
s
position
early
in
the
morning
and
was
able
to
place
his
shots
wherever
desired
it
was
while
so
engaged
that
he
observed
an
indian
in
full
view
near
the
river
calling
the
attention
of
his
comrade
to
the
fact
he
asked
him
to
watch
him
drop
that
indian
a
feat
which
he
succeeded
in
performing
several
other
indians
rushed
to
the
assistance
of
their
fallen
comrade
when
private
tuttle
by
a
skilful
and
rapid
use
of
his
springfield
succeeded
in
killing
two
other
warriors
the
indians
enraged
no
doubt
at
this
rough
handling
directed
their
aim
at
private
tuttle
who
fell
pierced
through
the
head
by
a
he
was
one
of
the
most
useful
and
daring
soldiers
who
ever
served
under
my
command
about
this
time
captain
french
who
was
engaged
with
the
indians
who
were
attacking
us
from
below
succeeded
in
shooting
a
warrior
from
his
saddle
while
several
ponies
were
known
to
be
wounded
or
disabled
the
indians
now
began
to
display
a
strong
force
in
our
front
on
the
bluffs
colonel
hart
was
ordered
to
push
a
line
of
dismounted
men
to
the
crest
and
prevent
the
further
advance
of
the
enemy
towards
the
river
this
duty
was
handsomely
performed
by
a
portion
of
captain
yates
s
squadron
colonel
hart
had
posted
lieutenant
charles
braden
and
twenty
men
on
a
small
knoll
which
commanded
our
left
against
this
party
the
indians
made
their
first
onslaught
a
mounted
party
of
warriors
numbering
nearly
two
hundred
rode
boldly
to
within
thirty
yards
of
lieutenant
braden
s
position
when
the
latter
and
his
command
delivered
such
a
fire
that
the
indians
were
driven
rapidly
from
that
part
of
the
field
after
having
evidently
suffered
considerable
loss
unfortunately
lieutenant
braden
received
a
through
the
upper
part
of
the
thigh
passing
directly
through
the
bone
but
he
maintained
his
position
with
great
gallantry
and
coolness
until
he
had
repulsed
the
enemy
hundreds
of
indians
were
now
to
be
seen
galloping
up
and
down
along
our
front
each
moment
becoming
bolder
owing
to
the
smallness
of
our
force
which
was
then
visible
believing
the
proper
time
had
arrived
to
assume
the
offensive
orders
to
this
effect
were
accordingly
sent
to
colonel
hart
and
captain
french
the
two
wing
commanders
lieutenant
weston
was
directed
to
move
his
troop
l
up
a
deep
ravine
on
our
left
which
would
convey
him
to
the
enemy
s
position
and
as
soon
as
an
opportunity
occurred
he
was
to
charge
them
and
pursue
the
indians
with
all
the
vigor
practicable
immediately
after
captain
owen
hale
was
directed
to
move
his
squadron
consisting
of
e
and
k
troops
in
conjunction
with
l
troop
and
the
three
to
charge
simultaneously
similar
dispositions
were
ordered
in
the
centre
and
right
lieutenant
custer
commanding
b
troop
was
ordered
to
advance
and
charge
the
indians
in
front
of
our
centre
while
captains
yates
and
moylan
moved
rapidly
forward
in
the
same
direction
before
this
movement
began
it
became
necessary
to
dislodge
a
large
party
of
indians
posted
in
a
ravine
and
behind
rocks
in
our
front
who
were
engaged
in
keeping
up
a
heavy
fire
upon
our
troops
while
the
latter
were
forming
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
horse
of
lieutenant
hiram
ketchum
of
the
expedition
was
shot
under
him
my
own
horse
was
also
shot
under
me
within
a
few
paces
of
the
latter
the
duty
of
driving
the
indians
engaged
in
was
intrusted
to
lieutenant
charles
varnum
cavalry
with
a
detachment
of
a
troop
cavalry
who
soon
forced
the
indians
back
from
their
cover
everything
being
in
readiness
for
a
general
advance
the
charge
was
ordered
and
the
squadrons
took
the
gallop
to
the
tune
of
garryowen
the
band
being
posted
immediately
in
rear
of
the
skirmish
line
the
indians
had
evidently
come
out
prepared
to
do
their
best
and
with
no
misgivings
as
to
their
success
as
the
mounds
and
high
bluffs
beyond
the
river
were
covered
with
groups
of
old
men
squaws
and
children
who
had
collected
there
to
witness
our
destruction
in
this
instance
the
proverbial
power
of
music
to
soothe
the
savage
breast
utterly
failed
for
no
sooner
did
the
band
strike
up
the
cheery
notes
of
garryowen
and
the
squadrons
advance
to
the
charge
than
the
indians
exhibited
unmistakable
signs
of
commotion
and
their
resistance
became
more
feeble
until
finally
satisfied
of
the
earnestness
of
our
attack
they
turned
their
ponies
heads
and
began
a
disorderly
flight
the
cavalry
put
spurs
to
their
horses
and
dashed
forward
in
pursuit
the
various
troop
and
squadron
commanders
vying
with
one
another
as
to
who
should
head
the
advance
the
appearance
of
the
main
command
in
sight
down
the
valley
at
this
moment
enabled
me
to
relieve
captain
french
s
command
below
us
and
he
was
ordered
to
join
in
the
pursuit
lieutenant
mcintosh
commanding
g
troop
moved
his
command
up
the
valley
at
a
gallop
and
prevented
many
of
the
indians
from
crossing
the
chase
was
continued
with
the
utmost
vigor
until
the
indians
were
completely
dispersed
and
driven
a
distance
of
nine
miles
from
where
the
engagement
took
place
and
they
were
here
forced
back
across
the
yellowstone
the
last
pony
killed
in
the
fight
being
shot
fully
eight
miles
from
the
point
of
attack
the
number
of
indians
opposed
to
us
has
been
estimated
by
the
various
officers
engaged
as
from
eight
hundred
to
a
thousand
my
command
numbered
four
hundred
and
fifty
including
officers
and
men
the
indians
were
made
up
of
different
bands
of
sioux
principally
unepapas
the
whole
under
command
of
sitting
bull
who
participated
in
the
second
day
s
fight
and
who
for
once
has
been
taught
a
lesson
he
will
not
soon
forget
a
large
number
of
indians
who
fought
us
were
fresh
from
their
reservations
on
the
missouri
river
many
of
the
warriors
engaged
in
the
fight
on
both
days
were
dressed
in
complete
suits
of
the
clothes
issued
at
the
agencies
to
indians
the
arms
with
which
they
fought
us
several
of
which
were
captured
in
the
fight
were
of
the
latest
improved
patterns
of
repeating
rifles
and
their
supply
of
metallic
seemed
unlimited
as
they
were
anything
but
sparing
in
their
use
so
amply
have
they
been
supplied
with
rifles
and
ammunition
that
neither
bows
nor
arrows
were
employed
against
us
as
an
evidence
that
these
indians
at
least
many
of
them
were
recently
from
the
missouri
river
agencies
we
found
provisions
such
as
coffee
in
their
abandoned
camps
and
cooking
and
other
domestic
utensils
such
as
only
reservation
indians
are
supplied
with
besides
our
scouts
conversed
with
them
across
the
river
for
nearly
an
hour
before
the
fight
became
general
and
satisfied
themselves
as
to
the
identity
of
their
foes
i
only
regret
that
it
was
impossible
for
my
command
to
effect
a
crossing
of
the
river
before
our
presence
was
discovered
and
while
the
hostile
village
was
located
near
at
hand
as
i
am
confident
that
we
could
have
largely
reduced
the
necessity
for
appropriation
for
indian
supplies
the
coming
winter
the
losses
of
the
indians
in
ponies
were
particularly
heavy
while
we
know
their
losses
in
killed
and
wounded
were
beyond
all
proportion
to
that
which
they
were
enabled
to
inflict
upon
us
our
losses
being
one
officer
badly
wounded
four
men
killed
and
three
wounded
four
horses
killed
and
four
wounded
careful
investigation
justifies
the
statement
that
including
both
days
battles
the
indians
losses
will
number
forty
warriors
while
their
wounded
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
may
increase
this
number
respectfully
submitted
signed
custer
cavalry
commanding
stockade
on
the
yellowstone
september
i
know
you
will
rejoice
when
your
eyes
fall
upon
the
date
and
heading
of
this
letter
and
you
learn
that
we
are
thus
far
on
our
homeward
journey
all
safe
and
well
this
letter
is
to
be
a
short
one
after
having
finished
the
letter
i
underscore
the
word
as
it
has
only
been
decided
a
few
hours
ago
to
despatch
three
of
our
indian
scouts
from
here
to
fort
buford
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
distant
by
river
only
eighty
by
land
with
mail
and
to
bring
back
what
awaits
us
in
return
as
there
are
many
official
matters
for
me
to
attend
to
between
now
and
morning
the
time
of
the
departure
of
the
scouts
i
do
not
hope
to
give
you
but
the
main
points
of
a
letter
the
details
to
be
filled
up
by
word
of
mouth
i
am
here
with
six
companies
of
cavalry
having
separated
from
the
main
expedition
several
days
ago
on
the
mussel
shell
river
and
marched
to
this
point
direct
a
distance
of
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
the
mules
of
the
large
trains
began
giving
out
forage
was
almost
exhausted
the
horses
being
allowed
only
about
three
pounds
per
day
fourteen
pounds
being
regular
allowance
the
country
was
entirely
unknown
no
guides
knew
anything
of
the
route
before
us
general
did
not
think
it
wise
to
venture
into
the
unknown
and
uninviting
region
with
his
command
but
i
did
not
feel
inclined
to
yield
to
obstacles
and
made
an
application
to
take
the
main
portion
of
the
cavalry
and
strike
through
for
the
stockade
direct
instead
of
turning
back
i
asked
that
the
railroad
engineers
be
allowed
to
continue
with
me
consent
was
given
and
we
started
at
it
was
not
believed
that
i
would
get
through
so
strong
was
this
impression
that
in
the
official
order
issued
for
my
movement
there
was
a
clause
authorizing
me
to
burn
or
abandon
all
my
wagons
or
other
public
property
if
in
my
opinion
such
steps
were
necessary
to
preserve
life
i
could
not
help
but
smile
to
myself
as
i
read
that
portion
of
the
order
i
had
no
idea
of
burning
or
abandoning
a
wagon
after
we
had
separated
from
the
main
column
the
chief
of
the
engineers
remarked
to
the
officers
how
positively
sanguine
the
general
is
that
he
will
make
this
trip
and
so
i
was
i
assured
him
from
the
first
and
from
day
to
day
that
the
cavalry
would
bring
them
through
all
right
we
had
the
to
strike
across
and
encounter
instead
of
serious
obstacles
the
most
favorable
country
yet
met
by
us
for
marching
hitherto
we
had
made
about
fifteen
miles
per
day
when
we
started
on
this
trip
we
marched
miles
one
day
and
the
next
and
so
on
and
brought
in
every
wagon
with
which
we
started
reaching
here
about
seven
o
clock
the
morning
of
the
sixth
day
from
our
separation
the
main
command
headed
back
towards
the
yellowstone
and
expects
to
be
twelve
or
thirteen
days
in
making
the
trip
i
am
going
to
send
an
officer
with
his
squadron
in
charge
of
fourteen
wagons
loaded
with
forage
to
the
relief
of
the
rest
of
the
command
our
location
for
next
winter
is
settled
we
shall
be
at
fort
lincoln
and
the
decision
is
satisfactory
to
me
i
presume
you
wish
you
were
here
to
give
the
of
the
battalion
c
a
little
advice
as
to
what
companies
shall
be
designated
for
each
station
so
far
as
this
reason
alone
is
concerned
i
am
glad
that
you
are
not
here
as
i
not
only
would
not
wish
you
to
attempt
to
influence
such
a
decision
but
that
no
person
or
persons
might
have
just
ground
for
imagining
that
you
had
done
so
the
officers
are
hinting
strongly
in
the
endeavor
to
ascertain
who
goes
where
but
thus
far
none
are
any
the
wiser
for
the
simple
reason
that
i
have
not
decided
the
matter
yet
in
the
case
of
a
single
troop
c
this
reference
is
to
himself
it
is
a
delicate
and
in
some
respects
an
undesirable
task
as
all
so
far
as
i
know
desire
to
go
to
fort
lincoln
if
no
accident
occurs
we
shall
reach
there
before
october
less
than
a
month
from
this
date
and
probably
less
than
ten
days
from
the
time
you
receive
this
so
that
all
your
anxiety
about
me
will
be
at
an
end
i
do
not
intend
to
relax
my
caution
on
the
march
between
here
and
lincoln
as
i
do
not
forget
that
the
two
officers
killed
last
year
met
their
deaths
near
the
close
of
the
expedition
i
think
i
told
you
in
my
letter
of
eighty
pages
about
my
chasing
elk
four
miles
and
killing
three
since
then
i
have
had
the
to
kill
a
fine
large
taller
than
dandy
d
weighing
cleaned
eight
hundred
pounds
and
with
the
handsomest
pair
of
antlers
i
ever
saw
and
such
a
beautiful
coat
i
killed
him
only
a
mile
and
a
half
from
camp
sent
for
a
wagon
and
carried
him
entire
back
with
us
when
the
officers
and
men
and
even
those
belonging
to
the
scientific
party
flocked
to
the
grassy
plot
in
front
of
my
tent
to
see
him
d
his
favorite
the
photographer
who
accompanied
the
scientists
hitched
up
his
and
drove
over
to
take
a
picture
of
what
they
called
the
king
of
the
all
the
officers
and
the
photographer
insisted
that
not
only
the
game
but
the
hunter
should
appear
in
the
picture
so
i
sat
down
dressed
as
i
was
in
my
buckskins
resting
one
hand
on
an
antler
and
you
may
judge
of
the
immense
size
of
the
elk
when
i
tell
you
that
as
i
sat
there
my
head
only
reached
to
about
half
the
height
of
the
antlers
the
picture
is
to
form
one
of
the
series
now
being
collected
on
the
expedition
under
the
auspices
of
the
smithsonian
institute
since
the
expedition
started
i
have
become
acquainted
with
the
gentlemen
of
the
scientific
corps
particularly
with
the
zoologist
and
the
taxidermist
the
latter
has
been
kind
enough
to
make
me
a
pupil
of
his
and
i
can
now
preserve
animals
for
all
practical
purposes
i
have
been
able
to
supply
the
gentlemen
referred
to
with
many
specimens
of
animals
and
in
return
they
have
not
only
taught
me
but
supplied
me
with
all
the
means
necessary
to
preserve
prepared
animals
you
should
see
how
very
devoted
i
am
to
this
to
me
very
pleasant
and
interesting
pastime
often
after
marching
all
day
a
light
may
be
seen
in
my
tent
long
after
the
entire
camp
is
asleep
and
a
might
see
me
with
sleeves
rolled
above
the
elbow
busily
engaged
preparing
the
head
of
some
animal
killed
in
the
chase
assisting
me
might
be
seen
the
orderly
and
hughes
both
from
their
sleepy
looks
seeming
to
say
how
much
longer
are
we
to
be
kept
out
of
our
beds
i
have
succeeded
so
well
in
taxidermy
that
i
can
take
the
head
and
neck
of
an
antelope
fresh
from
the
body
and
in
two
hours
have
it
fully
ready
for
preservation
i
have
prepared
a
most
beautiful
head
and
neck
for
tom
he
intends
it
for
his
sweetheart
and
will
send
it
by
express
from
bismarck
i
have
just
finished
heads
for
two
officers
which
they
intend
as
presents
for
their
wives
and
one
i
shall
give
to
the
audubon
club
then
i
have
the
heads
of
two
deer
of
a
buck
and
doe
antelope
for
and
the
head
and
skin
with
claws
of
a
the
latter
is
not
thoroughly
cured
owing
to
our
constant
marching
and
the
immense
amount
of
fat
contained
in
the
neck
and
hide
the
plus
of
all
is
the
king
of
the
i
have
succeeded
in
preserving
him
entire
antlers
head
neck
body
legs
and
hoofs
in
fine
condition
so
that
he
can
be
mounted
and
look
as
in
to
prevent
the
hair
being
rubbed
i
have
caused
the
head
to
be
well
covered
with
and
this
with
the
entire
skin
to
be
sewed
up
securely
in
canvas
the
scientists
informed
me
that
there
were
but
few
specimens
on
this
continent
of
elk
preserved
entire
and
none
so
fine
as
mine
when
i
first
began
work
on
it
i
only
intended
to
save
the
head
neck
and
antlers
but
finding
that
i
was
able
to
save
the
whole
i
decided
upon
the
latter
course
had
i
kept
the
head
and
neck
only
it
was
intended
for
you
but
having
it
complete
alters
my
intention
as
it
would
require
a
room
to
contain
it
so
i
have
concluded
with
your
approval
to
present
it
to
the
audubon
club
in
detroit
e
e
it
is
now
in
detroit
i
have
a
fine
buffalo
head
for
you
beautifully
haired
and
with
symmetrical
horns
a
pair
of
a
pair
of
curlew
and
a
complete
my
present
collection
one
day
i
shot
three
antelope
without
changing
my
position
the
nearest
of
the
three
being
three
hundred
and
twenty
yards
from
me
our
mess
continues
to
be
successful
nearly
every
day
we
have
something
nice
to
send
to
lieutenant
braden
f
only
think
of
him
with
his
shattered
thigh
having
to
trail
over
a
rough
country
for
three
hundred
miles
he
is
not
transported
in
an
ambulance
but
a
long
stretcher
arranged
on
wheels
about
thirty
feet
apart
pulled
and
pushed
by
men
on
foot
they
carry
him
much
more
steadily
than
would
horses
or
mules
it
requires
a
full
company
of
men
each
day
to
transport
braden
in
this
way
he
is
with
the
main
command
but
was
doing
well
when
we
left
the
day
the
command
divided
i
had
the
band
take
a
position
near
the
route
where
the
rest
of
the
expedition
would
pass
and
when
he
and
his
escort
approached
they
struck
up
he
acknowledged
the
attention
as
well
as
he
could
f
lieutenant
braden
was
wounded
in
the
battle
described
in
the
official
report
which
accompanies
this
letter
upon
our
arrival
here
what
was
our
joy
to
find
quite
a
large
mail
awaiting
us
it
had
been
forwarded
from
rice
and
lincoln
to
fort
buford
and
from
there
came
here
by
scouts
i
received
four
letters
from
you
do
you
know
on
the
of
august
the
very
day
you
were
writing
me
one
of
the
letters
i
received
i
was
fighting
probably
at
the
same
time
after
i
received
my
four
letters
i
threw
myself
down
on
the
bed
to
read
them
when
any
one
poked
his
head
inside
my
large
and
comfortable
tent
and
ventured
a
question
you
can
probably
imagine
the
brevity
and
abruptness
of
a
certain
man
s
replies
my
communication
was
strictly
biblical
being
either
yea
yea
or
nay
east
bank
of
the
yellowstone
september
when
i
began
my
letter
a
few
days
ago
announcing
our
safe
return
to
the
stockade
i
said
you
must
only
expect
a
few
lines
but
those
few
lines
stretched
out
until
they
covered
five
sheets
of
i
could
now
cover
five
times
five
and
then
only
have
begun
my
letter
but
where
the
time
is
to
be
found
i
can
not
tell
we
are
just
taking
the
men
across
the
river
on
the
which
arrived
yesterday
my
and
about
half
the
troops
are
over
the
rest
will
have
followed
by
night
as
sheldon
publishers
of
the
say
i
am
going
to
boil
down
this
letter
to
as
many
brief
allusions
as
possible
instead
of
waiting
here
for
the
rest
of
the
command
to
move
will
find
us
on
our
way
to
lincoln
i
take
six
troops
of
the
two
companies
of
infantry
and
with
the
engineers
set
out
on
our
return
we
rely
confidently
on
reaching
lincoln
before
october
the
reports
brought
by
those
who
came
on
the
boat
place
everything
in
a
bright
light
regarding
our
new
quarters
at
lincoln
i
think
we
will
have
a
charming
garrison
this
winter
i
wish
we
had
some
one
competent
to
give
us
lessons
in
private
theatricals
i
learn
by
the
boat
that
department
have
telegraphed
to
lincoln
that
it
is
possible
i
may
wish
to
take
a
long
leave
they
almost
take
it
for
granted
i
will
go
but
i
shall
not
do
you
remember
on
my
return
from
the
washita
campaign
i
was
offered
a
leave
in
a
similar
manner
i
have
no
desire
to
be
absent
from
my
post
now
i
have
enjoyed
a
few
very
great
luxuries
at
dinner
on
the
for
the
first
time
this
season
september
i
tasted
new
potatoes
and
cucumbers
but
these
were
not
the
greatest
what
do
you
imagine
was
a
greater
luxury
raw
onions
g
even
at
this
great
distance
i
almost
tremble
when
i
inform
you
that
i
not
only
had
onions
for
dinner
but
the
captain
of
the
boat
gave
me
a
whole
bushel
of
fine
large
ones
i
supped
on
raw
onions
i
will
probably
breakfast
lunch
and
dine
on
them
and
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
libitum
ad
until
not
time
but
onions
shall
be
no
more
as
one
by
one
i
dispose
of
each
fragment
of
a
huge
onion
i
remark
go
it
old
fellow
make
the
most
of
your
liberties
you
are
on
the
now
and
school
soon
commences
in
other
words
if
you
intend
to
eat
raw
onions
now
is
your
only
time
for
missus
is
comin
g
i
have
copied
the
words
as
he
printed
them
i
would
be
glad
to
have
every
one
of
the
officers
now
with
me
stationed
at
my
post
my
relations
with
them
personal
and
official
are
extremely
agreeable
they
are
all
counting
on
going
to
lincoln
but
i
know
some
of
them
will
have
to
be
disappointed
the
steamer
will
probably
leave
for
lincoln
or
next
day
and
should
reach
there
in
four
or
five
days
so
that
you
should
receive
this
letter
in
about
one
week
the
steamer
brought
me
two
splendid
letters
from
you
one
dated
the
another
the
of
august
i
received
them
on
the
which
is
pretty
quick
considering
my
collection
of
geological
specimens
for
the
michigan
university
is
growing
satisfactorily
the
indian
battles
hindered
the
work
of
collecting
while
in
that
immediate
region
it
was
unsafe
to
go
far
from
the
command
i
am
sitting
in
my
large
comfortable
tent
writing
before
breakfast
and
now
i
must
refer
to
a
matter
which
thrusts
itself
upon
my
attention
almost
daily
yes
hourly
and
that
is
the
great
degree
of
comfort
which
i
have
enjoyed
throughout
this
long
and
march
and
it
is
all
due
to
your
thoughtfulness
and
foresight
and
the
manner
in
which
you
fitted
me
up
surpasses
all
my
comrades
no
mess
has
compared
with
mine
in
its
appointments
and
outfit
i
have
the
best
cook
and
certainly
no
bed
can
equal
mine
whenever
i
look
around
me
i
see
the
evidences
of
your
handiwork
and
care
for
my
welfare
you
never
knew
people
more
enthusiastic
over
the
than
the
engineers
connected
with
the
railroad
party
well
i
must
terminate
this
letter
as
i
see
no
likelihood
of
my
being
able
to
tell
you
of
what
i
have
to
say
however
we
will
have
all
winter
in
our
brand
spankin
new
house
to
talk
it
over
and
over
here
i
have
reached
my
page
of
this
large
paper
i
only
thought
of
writing
three
or
four
and
have
boiled
down
as
hard
as
i
could
fort
lincoln
september
where
are
the
numerous
bridges
now
which
you
have
been
crossing
and
recrossing
in
regard
to
our
return
being
delayed
until
late
in
october
perhaps
until
the
first
of
november
well
here
we
are
not
only
as
good
as
new
but
if
anything
heartier
healthier
and
more
robust
than
ever
i
have
not
drawn
a
single
unhealthy
breath
since
we
started
on
the
expedition
and
if
ever
a
lot
of
hardy
strong
and
athletic
young
fellows
were
assembled
in
one
party
it
is
to
be
seen
in
a
group
of
the
officers
of
the
what
a
history
and
reputation
this
cavalry
has
achieved
for
itself
although
a
new
and
young
regiment
it
has
left
all
the
older
fellows
in
the
lurch
until
it
is
the
best
and
most
widely
known
of
any
in
the
service
i
am
provoked
to
think
i
wrote
you
a
long
letter
on
the
yellowstone
also
a
telegram
and
intrusted
them
to
an
officer
who
was
to
take
passage
in
the
steamer
and
leave
about
the
time
we
did
it
should
have
reached
here
several
days
before
we
arrived
but
i
took
six
troops
of
cavalry
and
the
engineers
crossed
the
yellowstone
to
this
side
and
reached
fort
lincoln
in
eight
days
we
took
everybody
by
surprise
and
beat
the
steamer
here
so
that
your
letter
and
telegram
are
still
on
the
boat
somewhere
between
this
point
and
the
stockade
you
may
rely
upon
it
that
no
grass
grew
under
our
feet
on
our
return
march
i
knew
that
my
family
consisting
of
one
was
in
advance
somewhere
and
as
the
saying
is
i
just
lit
h
i
am
so
comfortably
fixed
in
my
large
heavy
canvas
railroad
tent
that
was
given
me
on
the
expedition
i
am
sure
that
you
and
i
could
live
comfortably
in
it
all
winter
h
here
follows
a
description
of
fort
lincoln
his
sanguine
temperament
made
it
seem
little
short
of
an
earthly
paradise
he
did
not
seem
to
realize
that
the
prosaic
and
plain
government
buildings
were
placed
on
a
treeless
and
barren
plain
in
a
carefully
prepared
plan
of
our
house
which
he
had
drawn
he
gave
the
dimensions
and
description
of
each
room
and
over
the
door
of
his
library
a
triple
underlining
of
his
words
my
room
and
the
motto
who
enters
here
leaves
hope
he
thus
began
before
we
had
even
occupied
the
house
playfully
to
threaten
any
one
who
disturbed
his
writing
or
studies
i
am
much
pleased
with
the
appearance
of
the
citizens
who
have
come
across
the
river
from
bismarck
to
pay
their
respects
and
offer
congratulations
on
the
summer
s
campaign
some
of
the
yankton
gentlemen
are
here
attending
court
and
they
also
came
over
to
see
me
i
have
just
had
a
telegram
from
general
sheridan
welcome
fort
lincoln
september
when
you
find
that
i
have
just
sent
the
cavalry
band
to
serenade
on
his
departure
you
will
say
to
yourself
he
has
been
too
forgiving
well
perhaps
i
have
i
often
think
of
the
beautiful
expression
uttered
by
president
lincoln
at
the
consecration
of
the
gettysburg
monument
and
feel
how
nearly
it
expresses
my
belief
with
malice
toward
none
with
charity
for
all
and
i
hope
this
will
ever
be
mine
to
say
i
i
the
officer
to
whom
reference
is
made
had
been
a
persistent
and
exasperating
enemy
of
my
husband
during
the
summer
and
i
could
not
forget
or
forgive
even
after
apologies
were
offered
especially
as
they
were
not
offered
in
the
presence
of
others
adopting
your
wise
and
deserved
suggestion
i
have
at
last
written
my
long
delayed
letter
to
ford
and
among
other
things
told
him
i
would
send
him
per
express
the
skins
of
two
young
elk
that
i
killed
to
have
them
tanned
and
a
pair
of
shoes
made
for
each
of
us
so
you
see
i
did
as
i
generally
do
obeyed
my
other
half
who
nine
times
out
of
ten
is
right
and
generally
the
time
during
a
halt
of
two
days
just
before
we
started
for
home
i
wrote
a
long
article
and
shall
mail
it
with
this
not
only
did
i
do
that
instead
of
resting
because
of
the
appeals
of
the
magazine
editors
but
it
behooved
me
to
get
off
my
contributions
with
some
regularity
for
if
i
stop
now
those
who
attribute
them
to
you
would
say
all
the
more
it
was
because
you
were
not
along
to
do
the
work
for
me
if
people
only
knew
the
amusement
they
have
afforded
us
by
laying
the
responsibility
of
these
articles
on
your
shoulders
i
must
not
forget
to
tell
you
that
during
the
expedition
i
killed
with
my
rifle
and
brought
into
camp
antelope
four
buffalo
four
elk
seven
deer
four
of
them
two
white
wolves
and
one
red
fox
geese
ducks
and
without
number
completed
my
summer
s
record
no
one
assisted
me
in
killing
the
antelope
deer
or
elk
except
one
of
the
latter
one
porcupine
and
a
wildcat
i
brought
in
alive
both
of
these
amiable
creatures
i
intend
to
send
to
central
park
letters
from
the
black
hills
following
extracts
are
taken
from
letters
sent
from
the
expedition
to
the
black
hills
referred
to
in
chapter
thirteen
miles
from
fort
lincoln
july
yesterday
was
a
hard
day
on
the
trains
the
recent
rains
had
so
softened
the
ground
that
the
wagons
sunk
to
the
hubs
and
instead
of
getting
in
camp
by
noon
as
we
expected
one
battalion
did
not
get
in
until
after
dark
but
we
had
a
good
dinner
and
every
one
is
feeling
well
this
morning
i
am
making
a
late
start
in
order
to
give
the
mules
a
chance
to
graze
i
send
you
by
bearer
a
young
curlew
as
a
playmate
to
the
should
it
live
its
wings
had
better
be
clipped
grasshoppers
are
its
principal
diet
our
mess
is
a
great
success
last
night
notwithstanding
the
late
hour
at
which
we
reached
camp
johnson
our
new
colored
cook
had
hot
biscuit
and
this
morning
hot
cakes
and
biscuit
we
will
not
be
over
twenty
or
miles
from
the
post
the
men
are
standing
around
waiting
to
take
down
the
tents
so
i
must
say
prospect
valley
dakota
twelve
miles
from
the
montana
line
july
we
are
making
a
halt
of
one
day
at
this
charming
spot
in
order
to
rest
the
animals
and
give
the
men
an
opportunity
to
wash
their
clothes
i
will
begin
by
saying
everything
is
and
has
been
perfectly
satisfactory
every
one
officers
men
and
citizens
are
in
the
best
of
health
and
spirits
we
have
marched
through
an
exceedingly
interesting
country
we
are
now
in
the
most
beautiful
valley
we
have
seen
thus
far
and
encamped
on
a
small
tributary
of
the
little
missouri
and
about
five
miles
from
the
latter
so
beautiful
did
this
place
seem
to
us
when
we
first
came
in
sight
of
it
i
directed
the
who
is
making
a
map
of
the
country
to
call
it
prospect
valley
three
days
ago
we
reached
the
cave
referred
to
before
we
started
by
the
indian
called
it
was
found
to
be
about
four
hundred
feet
long
and
just
as
he
described
the
walls
and
top
covered
with
inscriptions
and
drawings
the
prints
of
hands
and
feet
are
also
in
the
rocks
i
think
this
was
all
the
work
of
indians
at
an
early
day
although
i
can
not
satisfactorily
account
for
the
drawings
of
ships
found
there
bos
j
though
this
is
his
first
expedition
takes
to
life
on
the
plains
as
naturally
as
if
bred
to
it
one
of
the
officers
says
he
thinks
it
must
run
in
the
he
has
to
go
through
the
usual
experience
that
falls
to
all
every
one
practises
jokes
on
him
but
he
has
such
a
good
disposition
it
does
not
even
i
know
that
you
would
espouse
his
cause
against
us
if
you
had
seen
him
take
some
bits
of
rocks
out
of
his
pocket
every
night
after
we
had
reached
camp
and
put
them
to
soak
in
his
they
were
given
to
him
by
tom
who
assured
him
that
they
were
sponge
stone
a
variety
that
softened
by
keeping
them
in
water
for
a
certain
length
of
time
after
a
few
nights
of
faithful
practice
it
dawned
upon
him
that
he
was
again
the
victim
of
a
practical
joke
and
he
quietly
dropped
them
by
the
way
without
saying
a
word
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
to
take
up
arms
in
his
defence
for
he
gets
even
with
us
in
the
j
our
younger
brother
he
has
been
so
pleased
with
his
mule
from
the
first
and
has
praised
him
to
me
repeatedly
he
a
good
animal
for
a
but
endurance
in
his
constitution
rather
triumphs
over
speed
i
could
not
resist
taking
advantage
of
the
country
to
play
a
trick
on
bos
one
day
the
land
was
undulating
and
you
know
how
it
always
seems
as
if
one
could
surely
see
for
miles
beyond
when
the
top
of
each
divide
is
reached
and
how
one
can
go
on
all
day
over
the
constant
rise
and
fall
of
the
earth
thinking
the
next
divide
will
reveal
a
vast
stretch
of
country
bos
rode
beside
me
and
i
invented
an
excuse
to
go
in
advance
i
made
vic
gallop
slowly
over
the
divide
and
when
out
of
sight
on
the
other
side
i
put
spurs
to
him
and
dashed
through
the
low
ground
when
bos
came
in
sight
i
was
slowly
ambling
up
the
next
divide
and
calling
to
him
to
come
on
he
spurred
his
mule
shouted
to
him
and
waved
his
arms
and
legs
to
incite
him
to
a
faster
gait
when
he
neared
me
i
disappeared
over
another
divide
and
giving
vic
the
rein
only
slackened
speed
when
it
became
time
for
bos
to
appear
then
when
i
had
brought
my
horse
down
to
a
walk
i
called
out
why
on
earth
don
t
you
come
on
believing
that
the
gait
he
saw
me
take
had
been
unvarying
he
could
not
understand
why
i
lengthened
the
distance
between
us
so
rapidly
i
kept
this
up
until
he
discovered
my
joke
and
i
was
obliged
to
ride
back
to
join
him
and
suit
vic
s
steps
to
those
of
his
exhausted
mule
no
indians
or
signs
of
indians
were
seen
from
the
time
we
left
lincoln
until
the
day
before
yesterday
when
about
twenty
were
discovered
near
the
column
they
scampered
off
as
soon
as
observed
yesterday
we
came
where
they
had
slept
the
officer
on
duty
saw
about
following
our
trail
signal
smokes
were
sent
up
all
around
us
yesterday
afternoon
by
the
indians
and
some
were
seen
watching
us
after
we
reached
camp
but
no
hostile
demonstrations
have
been
made
our
indian
guides
say
the
signals
may
be
intended
to
let
the
village
know
where
we
are
so
that
they
may
keep
out
of
our
way
we
expect
to
reach
the
base
of
the
black
hills
in
about
three
days
professor
winchell
and
grinnell
discovered
yesterday
the
fossil
remains
of
an
animal
belonging
to
some
extinct
race
which
in
life
exceeded
in
size
the
largest
elephant
i
am
gradually
forming
my
annual
menagerie
i
have
one
live
rattlesnake
for
agnes
k
two
half
grown
one
eagle
and
four
owls
i
had
also
two
fine
badgers
full
grown
but
they
were
accidentally
smothered
k
this
was
our
young
visitor
whose
horror
of
snakes
general
custer
well
knew
these
are
the
first
lines
i
have
written
since
my
last
letter
to
you
nearly
a
fortnight
since
and
you
can
not
imagine
how
tired
my
hand
and
arm
have
become
already
i
have
made
no
attempt
to
write
on
the
march
the
short
time
i
have
after
reaching
camp
every
day
is
devoted
to
rest
and
sleep
general
sandy
is
delighted
with
the
cavalry
he
says
no
regiment
compares
with
it
except
perhaps
the
there
has
not
been
a
single
nor
a
drunken
officer
since
we
left
lincoln
our
mess
is
a
decided
and
gratifying
success
johnson
is
not
only
an
excellent
cook
but
very
prompt
we
breakfast
at
four
o
clock
every
morning
every
day
i
invite
some
officer
to
dine
with
us
i
remember
your
wishes
and
ride
at
the
head
of
the
column
keeping
inside
our
lines
all
the
time
although
it
is
a
great
deprivation
to
me
not
to
go
outside
and
hunt
i
feel
exactly
like
some
young
lady
extremely
fond
of
dancing
who
having
a
cold
has
been
forbidden
by
her
anxious
mamma
to
do
more
than
look
on
at
some
elegant
party
i
received
my
orders
from
my
commanding
officer
before
starting
and
i
am
going
to
try
and
render
strict
obedience
l
l
this
reference
to
commanding
officer
meant
his
wife
whose
authority
only
extended
to
precautionary
instructions
as
to
his
safety
and
health
the
reiterated
petition
was
that
he
should
never
leave
the
column
alone
in
looking
for
a
road
i
sometimes
get
a
mile
or
perhaps
two
ahead
of
the
command
but
i
always
have
seventy
or
eighty
men
with
me
and
after
i
mean
to
take
in
addition
two
more
companies
i
have
no
intention
of
getting
beyond
sight
and
hearing
of
the
main
column
there
is
an
always
and
the
indian
scouts
at
the
front
and
on
the
flanks
i
have
killed
six
antelope
at
the
head
of
the
command
only
think
of
the
time
expired
day
before
yesterday
and
by
the
time
this
reaches
you
of
our
time
of
separation
will
have
passed
we
will
not
be
delayed
in
our
return
later
than
i
expected
when
we
left
fort
lincoln
as
i
write
the
dogs
surround
me
cardigan
is
sleeping
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
tuck
at
the
head
and
blücher
near
by
i
am
not
certain
whether
i
will
be
able
to
send
back
more
scouts
or
not
this
mail
is
to
be
carried
by
two
rees
bull
bear
and
skunk
s
head
bloody
knife
is
doing
splendidly
on
this
trip
there
is
not
a
single
man
on
the
in
this
entire
command
a
fact
which
the
medical
officer
regards
as
unprecedented
we
will
move
into
the
valley
of
the
little
missouri
and
probably
follow
that
stream
to
the
black
hills
you
may
judge
of
the
fine
country
we
have
passed
over
by
the
fact
that
our
mules
and
have
actually
improved
since
we
left
lincoln
we
have
travelled
two
hundred
and
and
a
half
miles
and
in
a
straight
line
we
are
one
hundred
and
seventy
miles
from
lincoln
i
must
stop
now
and
write
my
official
report
camp
near
harney
s
peak
august
i
wish
you
could
see
me
at
this
moment
as
i
am
prepared
to
write
to
you
first
i
must
tell
you
that
i
can
not
send
a
very
long
letter
not
that
i
have
not
volumes
to
say
to
you
but
for
reasons
which
i
will
briefly
explain
in
the
evening
after
reaching
camp
i
am
too
much
occupied
and
have
too
much
hard
work
to
find
time
to
write
after
dinner
i
usually
take
an
escort
and
search
out
a
few
miles
of
road
for
the
following
day
when
i
return
i
am
ready
to
hasten
to
my
comfortable
bed
m
m
nothing
but
excessive
fatigue
and
a
determination
to
make
the
best
of
everything
could
have
prompted
him
to
describe
it
as
comfortable
on
the
first
day
s
march
out
from
garrison
a
careless
soldier
forgot
the
three
boards
that
were
intended
to
keep
the
bedding
from
absorbing
the
dampness
in
case
of
rain
during
the
entire
summer
owing
to
this
piece
of
forgetfulness
the
mattress
was
laid
down
every
night
on
ground
that
was
always
uneven
and
sometimes
wet
we
have
regularly
at
a
quarter
before
three
so
that
it
behooves
one
to
get
to
bed
as
early
as
possible
has
been
charlie
reynolds
leaves
in
the
morning
with
the
mail
for
fort
laramie
i
am
going
to
explore
some
or
thirty
miles
in
that
direction
and
reynolds
will
go
with
me
i
take
five
companies
two
others
started
off
in
another
direction
this
morning
to
be
absent
three
days
so
you
see
they
are
kept
moving
i
will
be
gone
three
days
the
next
day
after
that
we
turn
our
faces
northward
and
begin
our
homeward
march
i
must
not
forget
to
explain
the
other
reason
why
i
can
not
send
you
a
letter
of
thirty
pages
or
so
this
time
one
of
those
that
tom
calls
my
little
notes
to
you
i
was
busy
with
the
office
duties
until
ten
and
then
i
began
my
official
report
i
had
so
many
interruptions
i
was
at
last
driven
to
print
engaged
on
a
placard
and
pin
it
on
the
front
of
my
tent
i
tied
up
the
flaps
shutting
myself
in
until
the
pages
of
my
report
were
written
it
is
now
a
quarter
to
one
breakfast
is
at
four
and
boots
and
saddles
will
sound
at
five
i
wish
i
could
go
more
into
detail
in
describing
the
expedition
which
has
exceeded
all
previous
ones
and
in
success
has
surpassed
my
most
sanguine
expectations
i
did
not
hope
to
have
my
with
me
and
here
it
has
followed
me
everywhere
we
have
discovered
a
rich
and
beautiful
country
we
have
had
no
indian
fights
and
will
have
none
we
have
discovered
gold
without
a
doubt
and
probably
other
valuable
metals
all
are
well
and
have
been
the
entire
trip
my
report
which
you
will
see
will
contain
much
that
i
would
have
sent
you
in
a
letter
august
we
have
marched
miles
in
a
southerly
direction
from
harney
s
peak
and
are
now
encamped
on
the
south
fork
of
the
cheyenne
river
about
ninety
miles
from
fort
laramie
reynolds
n
leaves
us
here
we
are
now
all
seated
or
lying
around
a
writing
the
closing
words
to
our
letters
n
the
scout
mentioned
in
chapter
xxvi
it
was
on
this
trip
to
fort
laramie
carrying
the
despatches
and
mail
that
he
suffered
such
hardships
and
peril
i
must
say
a
few
days
more
and
we
shall
be
at
home
for
we
start
north
at
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
bear
butte
dakota
august
though
we
shall
so
soon
be
at
home
i
must
send
a
few
lines
by
the
scout
who
takes
the
official
despatches
i
can
not
tell
you
how
busy
i
have
been
and
how
hard
and
constantly
i
have
worked
to
try
and
make
the
expedition
successful
i
have
attempted
to
be
several
other
things
besides
commanding
officer
particularly
guide
since
the
expedition
started
now
that
we
have
been
in
and
through
the
black
hills
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
the
whole
undertaking
has
proved
a
success
exceeding
the
expectations
of
the
most
sanguine
i
think
that
my
superior
officers
will
be
surprised
and
gratified
at
the
extent
and
thoroughness
of
our
explorations
the
photographer
who
accompanied
us
has
obtained
a
complete
set
of
magnificent
stereoscopic
views
of
black
hills
scenery
so
i
will
not
attempt
to
allude
to
this
lovely
country
until
i
can
review
it
with
you
by
aid
of
the
photographs
i
send
you
one
that
will
show
you
that
at
last
i
have
killed
a
grisly
after
a
most
exciting
hunt
and
contest
colonel
ludlow
bloody
knife
and
private
noonan
are
with
me
in
the
group
as
we
constituted
the
the
bear
measured
eight
feet
i
have
his
claws
the
scouts
are
on
their
ponies
waiting
for
the
mail
and
i
must
hasten
it
would
have
been
such
a
treat
to
have
had
you
see
all
that
we
have
seen
this
summer
and
shared
the
enjoyment
of
this
beautiful
land
but
never
mind
you
shall
come
next
summer
for
we
all
hope
to
return
again
no
indians
have
been
seen
lately
but
i
intend
to
be
careful
until
the
end
of
the
trip
letters
from
the
yellowstone
from
letters
written
on
the
second
expedition
to
the
yellowstone
during
the
summer
of
miles
from
fort
lincoln
may
it
has
just
been
decided
to
send
scouts
back
to
lincoln
they
leave
here
at
daylight
and
will
remain
there
hours
returning
to
us
with
despatches
and
mail
we
are
having
the
parrot
s
time
with
the
expedition
it
is
raining
now
and
has
been
since
we
started
the
roads
are
fearfully
bad
here
we
are
on
the
little
muddy
after
marching
four
days
and
only
miles
from
home
everybody
is
more
or
less
disgusted
except
me
and
i
feel
the
relief
of
not
having
to
bear
the
responsibility
of
the
delays
the
elements
seem
against
us
but
a
wet
season
and
bad
roads
can
be
looked
for
always
in
this
region
in
the
months
of
may
and
june
we
have
not
seen
any
signs
of
indians
thus
far
and
hardly
look
for
any
for
a
few
days
yet
i
have
been
extremely
prudent
sufficiently
so
to
satisfy
you
i
go
nowhere
without
taking
an
escort
with
me
i
act
as
if
indians
were
near
all
the
time
the
mess
prospers
well
tom
and
i
have
fried
onions
at
breakfast
and
dinner
and
raw
onions
for
lunch
o
the
scouts
that
were
left
at
lincoln
joined
us
yesterday
about
with
the
mail
i
wish
that
you
knew
how
good
it
was
to
get
the
letters
you
must
send
me
more
by
the
scouts
we
send
out
since
beginning
this
letter
it
is
decided
that
they
go
at
once
for
i
know
it
is
best
to
get
them
out
of
camp
at
night
so
they
have
been
directed
to
immediately
and
i
must
therefore
cut
this
letter
short
o
they
both
took
advantage
of
their
first
absence
from
home
to
partake
of
their
favorite
vegetable
onions
were
permitted
at
our
table
but
after
indulging
in
them
they
found
themselves
severely
let
alone
and
that
they
did
not
enjoy
i
said
this
evening
that
if
i
was
sure
this
expedition
would
go
no
farther
the
next
four
days
than
it
has
those
just
past
i
would
be
glad
to
take
despatches
to
lincoln
and
return
just
for
the
sake
of
getting
home
again
for
a
few
hours
on
little
missouri
may
i
am
determined
to
sit
up
even
though
it
is
ten
o
clock
and
write
to
you
notwithstanding
i
have
had
a
tremendous
day
s
work
i
breakfasted
at
four
o
clock
was
in
the
saddle
at
five
and
between
that
hour
and
i
rode
fifty
miles
over
a
rough
country
unknown
to
everybody
and
only
myself
for
a
guide
we
had
halted
here
for
one
day
in
order
to
determine
the
truth
of
the
many
rumors
which
you
and
all
of
us
have
heard
so
long
and
often
to
the
effect
that
the
hostile
indians
were
gathered
on
the
little
missouri
river
with
the
intention
of
fighting
us
here
i
suggested
to
general
terry
to
send
out
a
strong
up
the
river
to
find
out
all
that
could
be
ascertained
he
left
the
matter
to
me
and
i
took
four
companies
of
cavalry
and
a
part
of
the
scouts
and
at
five
o
clock
we
were
off
the
valley
of
the
river
averages
about
one
mile
in
width
hemmed
in
on
both
sides
by
impassable
bad
lands
the
river
is
crooked
beyond
description
to
shorten
the
story
we
marched
the
fifty
miles
and
got
back
before
dark
having
settled
the
question
beyond
a
doubt
that
all
stories
about
large
bodies
of
indians
being
here
are
the
merest
bosh
none
have
been
here
for
six
months
not
even
a
small
we
took
with
us
to
carry
feed
for
the
horses
when
we
lunched
all
the
officers
got
together
and
we
had
a
jolly
time
only
think
we
found
the
little
missouri
river
so
crooked
and
the
bad
lands
so
impassable
that
in
marching
fifty
miles
we
forded
the
river
times
the
bottom
is
quicksand
many
of
the
horses
went
down
frequently
tumbling
their
riders
into
the
water
but
all
were
in
good
spirits
and
every
one
laughed
at
every
one
else
s
mishaps
general
terry
just
left
my
tent
a
few
moments
since
and
when
i
asked
him
not
to
be
in
a
hurry
he
said
oh
i
ll
leave
you
for
you
must
be
tired
and
want
to
go
to
i
did
not
tell
him
that
i
was
going
to
write
to
you
before
i
slept
bloody
knife
looks
on
in
wonder
at
me
because
i
never
get
tired
and
says
no
other
man
could
ride
all
night
and
never
sleep
i
know
i
shall
sleep
soundly
when
i
do
lie
down
but
actually
i
feel
no
more
fatigued
now
than
i
did
before
mounting
my
horse
this
morning
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
is
for
you
alone
but
came
to
me
the
other
day
and
asked
me
to
arrange
that
he
should
be
stationed
at
our
post
next
winter
he
says
he
wants
to
be
in
a
garrison
where
the
duty
is
strict
and
above
all
he
desires
to
prove
that
he
is
and
desires
to
be
a
man
and
he
believes
that
he
could
do
much
better
than
he
has
if
he
could
serve
under
me
he
says
the
very
atmosphere
of
his
post
seems
filled
with
evil
for
him
i
have
a
scheme
by
which
i
think
i
can
accomplish
his
coming
and
i
believe
that
you
will
approve
p
p
we
had
been
extremely
anxious
about
the
officer
to
whom
my
husband
refers
and
longed
to
save
him
from
himself
since
he
is
gone
i
think
that
i
am
not
betraying
confidence
in
quoting
from
this
letter
the
scouts
reached
here
in
good
time
and
glad
was
i
to
get
my
letters
in
camp
about
ten
miles
west
of
the
little
missouri
may
we
left
camp
about
eight
o
clock
after
marching
a
few
miles
tom
bos
and
i
taking
some
men
started
on
a
near
route
across
the
country
knowing
that
we
would
intercept
the
column
later
on
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
left
the
main
command
and
both
times
they
have
lost
their
way
so
you
see
my
bump
of
locality
is
of
some
use
out
here
we
reached
this
camp
about
of
an
hour
from
the
time
we
left
the
column
but
the
latter
strayed
off
and
while
we
were
here
by
the
rest
did
not
reach
here
until
two
o
clock
when
they
found
they
were
lost
the
officers
all
assembled
at
the
head
of
the
column
to
consult
together
and
try
and
find
the
right
way
while
out
with
tom
and
bos
we
were
riding
through
a
part
of
the
country
filled
with
small
in
which
it
was
easy
to
lose
one
s
self
bos
stopped
a
few
moments
as
we
were
riding
through
a
ravine
and
dismounted
to
take
a
pebble
from
his
pony
s
shoe
i
observed
it
and
said
to
tom
let
s
slip
round
the
hill
behind
bos
where
he
can
t
find
us
and
when
he
starts
we
ll
fire
in
the
air
near
the
moment
we
passed
out
of
sight
our
entire
party
galloped
around
the
hill
behind
him
and
concealed
ourselves
tom
and
i
crawled
to
the
top
of
the
bill
and
peeped
through
the
grass
without
being
seen
sure
enough
bos
thought
he
was
lost
as
we
could
nowhere
be
seen
in
the
direction
he
expected
to
find
us
tom
and
i
were
watching
him
and
just
as
he
seemed
in
a
quandary
as
to
where
we
were
i
fired
my
rifle
so
that
the
bullet
whizzed
over
his
head
i
popped
out
of
sight
for
a
moment
and
when
i
looked
again
bos
was
heading
his
pony
towards
the
command
miles
away
i
fired
another
shot
in
his
direction
and
so
did
tom
and
away
bos
flew
across
the
plains
thinking
no
doubt
the
sioux
were
after
him
tom
and
i
mounted
our
horses
and
soon
overhauled
him
he
will
not
hear
the
last
of
it
for
some
time
charlie
reynolds
killed
two
sheep
and
gave
me
the
finest
of
the
two
heads
i
have
it
in
my
tent
now
and
hope
to
preserve
it
although
i
came
away
without
my
preservative
powders
nearly
all
my
amusement
is
with
bos
and
tom
we
lunch
together
every
day
i
have
about
made
up
my
mind
that
when
i
go
on
expeditions
like
this
you
are
to
go
too
you
could
have
endured
this
as
well
as
not
powder
river
about
twenty
miles
above
its
mouth
june
we
are
now
in
a
country
heretofore
unvisited
by
white
men
reynolds
who
had
been
guiding
the
command
lost
his
way
the
other
day
and
general
terry
did
not
know
what
to
do
about
finding
a
road
from
o
fallon
s
creek
across
to
powder
river
i
told
him
i
thought
i
could
guide
the
column
he
assented
so
tom
bos
and
i
started
ahead
with
company
d
and
the
scouts
as
escort
and
brought
the
command
to
this
point
over
what
seems
to
be
the
only
practicable
route
for
miles
on
either
side
through
the
worst
kind
of
bad
lands
the
general
did
not
believe
it
possible
to
find
a
road
through
when
after
a
hard
day
s
work
we
arrived
at
this
river
by
a
good
easy
road
making
miles
in
one
day
he
was
delighted
and
came
to
congratulate
me
yesterday
i
finished
a
article
which
will
go
in
the
next
mail
so
you
see
i
am
not
entirely
idle
day
before
yesterday
i
rode
nearly
fifty
miles
arose
yesterday
morning
and
went
to
work
at
my
article
determined
to
finish
it
before
night
which
i
did
amidst
constant
interruptions
it
is
now
nearly
midnight
and
i
must
go
to
my
bed
for
comes
at
three
as
a
slight
evidence
that
i
am
not
very
conceited
regarding
my
personal
appearance
i
have
not
looked
in
a
mirror
or
seen
the
reflection
of
my
beautiful
countenance
including
the
fine
growth
of
whiskers
since
i
looked
in
the
glass
at
lincoln
q
q
this
reference
to
the
color
of
his
beard
which
he
only
allowed
to
grow
on
campaigns
was
a
reminder
of
the
fact
upon
which
we
had
long
since
agreed
that
though
titian
might
have
found
beauty
in
that
tint
we
did
not
on
yellowstone
at
mouth
of
powder
river
june
this
morning
we
left
our
camp
on
powder
river
i
acting
again
as
guide
the
expedition
started
to
make
its
way
through
unknown
bad
lands
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
general
terry
felt
great
anxiety
in
regard
to
the
trip
as
he
feared
that
we
could
not
get
through
with
the
wagons
he
had
been
down
the
river
to
its
mouth
with
cavalry
and
he
and
those
with
him
said
that
wagons
could
not
make
the
march
in
a
month
and
the
bad
lands
looked
still
more
impracticable
he
came
to
my
tent
before
daylight
and
asked
me
if
i
would
try
to
find
the
road
he
seems
to
think
i
have
a
gift
in
that
way
and
he
hoped
that
we
might
get
within
ten
miles
of
the
river
s
mouth
what
rendered
our
condition
more
embarrassing
was
that
the
men
had
only
rations
for
one
day
left
i
started
with
one
company
and
the
scouts
and
in
we
plunged
one
company
had
been
sent
out
the
previous
day
to
look
for
a
road
and
their
failure
to
return
the
same
day
increased
the
anxiety
i
thought
likely
they
had
lost
their
way
and
had
slept
in
the
bad
lands
sure
enough
we
found
them
about
after
passing
through
some
perfectly
terrible
country
i
finally
struck
a
beautiful
road
along
a
high
plateau
and
instead
of
guiding
the
command
within
ten
miles
of
here
we
have
all
arrived
and
the
beside
if
you
will
look
on
the
map
near
my
desk
you
will
find
the
mouth
of
powder
river
and
our
present
location
on
the
yellowstone
almost
due
west
from
lincoln
follow
up
the
yellowstone
a
short
distance
and
the
first
stream
you
come
to
is
the
tongue
river
to
which
point
we
will
move
after
resting
three
or
four
days
we
will
there
be
joined
by
the
six
companies
of
the
regiment
now
absent
on
a
scout
and
i
shall
then
select
the
nine
companies
to
go
with
me
the
steamer
leaves
for
port
buford
as
i
was
up
at
three
this
morning
and
have
had
a
hard
day
s
march
and
as
it
is
now
going
on
to
twelve
i
must
hie
to
bed
to
get
a
little
rest
and
slumber
monday
june
before
breakfast
i
rose
early
this
morning
without
waiting
to
be
called
to
breakfast
in
order
that
i
might
write
my
letter
the
yellowstone
is
very
high
steamers
loaded
to
their
utmost
capacity
can
go
up
some
distance
above
the
mouth
of
the
big
horn
i
wanted
to
send
you
a
letter
that
i
wished
you
to
read
and
afterwards
had
i
not
thought
you
might
have
found
an
opportunity
to
come
up
the
river
in
the
the
new
supplies
for
our
mess
of
onions
potatoes
and
dried
apples
have
just
come
from
the
boat
tuck
r
regularly
comes
when
i
am
writing
and
lays
her
head
on
the
desk
rooting
up
my
hand
with
her
long
nose
until
i
consent
to
stop
and
notice
her
she
and
swift
lady
and
kaiser
sleep
in
my
tent
r
she
was
my
husband
s
favorite
dog
you
need
not
be
anxious
about
my
leaving
the
column
with
small
escorts
i
scarcely
hunt
any
s
s
this
letter
was
scorched
and
defaced
but
fortunately
i
could
read
it
all
thanks
to
those
who
sat
up
all
night
to
dry
the
mail
mouth
of
tongue
river
june
i
fear
that
my
last
letter
written
from
the
mouth
of
powder
river
was
not
received
in
very
good
condition
by
you
the
mail
was
sent
in
a
from
the
stockade
to
buford
under
charge
of
a
sergeant
and
three
or
four
men
of
the
infantry
just
as
they
were
pushing
off
from
the
the
boat
capsized
and
mail
and
soldiers
were
thrown
into
the
rapid
current
the
sergeant
sank
and
was
never
seen
again
the
mail
was
recovered
after
being
submerged
for
five
or
ten
minutes
captain
marsh
and
several
others
sat
up
all
night
and
dried
it
by
the
stove
i
was
told
that
my
letter
to
you
went
off
all
right
also
my
article
the
latter
was
recognized
by
a
young
newspaper
reporter
and
telegraph
operator
who
came
up
on
the
train
with
us
from
paul
and
he
took
special
pains
in
drying
it
with
six
companies
of
the
the
gatling
battery
the
scouts
and
the
i
left
the
mouth
of
powder
river
thursday
morning
leaving
all
our
wagons
behind
and
directing
our
march
for
this
point
less
than
forty
miles
distant
general
terry
and
staff
followed
by
steamer
we
marched
here
in
about
one
and
a
quarter
days
the
boat
arrived
yesterday
evening
the
officers
were
ordered
to
leave
their
tents
behind
they
are
now
lying
under
or
in
when
we
leave
here
i
shall
only
take
a
we
are
living
delightfully
this
morning
we
had
a
splendid
dish
of
fried
fish
which
tom
bos
and
i
caught
a
few
steps
from
my
tent
last
evening
the
other
day
on
our
march
from
powder
river
i
shot
an
antelope
that
night
while
sitting
round
the
and
while
hughes
was
making
our
coffee
i
roasted
some
of
the
ribs
indian
fashion
and
i
must
say
they
were
delicious
we
all
slept
in
the
open
air
around
the
fire
tom
and
i
under
a
fly
bos
and
autie
reed
on
the
opposite
side
tom
pelted
bos
with
sticks
and
clods
of
earth
after
we
had
retired
i
don
t
know
what
we
would
do
with
out
bos
to
tease
yesterday
tom
and
i
saw
a
flying
quite
high
in
the
air
we
were
in
the
bushes
and
could
not
see
each
other
neither
knew
that
the
other
intended
to
fire
both
fired
simultaneously
and
down
came
the
goose
killed
don
t
you
think
that
pretty
good
shooting
for
rifles
on
our
march
here
we
passed
through
some
very
extensive
indian
villages
rather
the
remains
of
villages
occupied
by
them
last
winter
i
was
at
the
head
of
the
column
as
we
rode
through
one
and
suddenly
came
upon
a
human
skull
lying
under
the
remains
of
an
extinct
fire
i
halted
to
examine
it
and
lying
near
by
i
found
the
uniform
of
a
soldier
evidently
it
was
a
cavalry
uniform
as
the
buttons
on
the
overcoat
had
c
on
them
and
the
dress
coat
had
the
yellow
cord
of
the
cavalry
uniform
running
through
it
the
skull
was
and
had
evidently
been
there
several
months
all
the
circumstances
went
to
show
that
the
skull
was
that
of
some
poor
mortal
who
had
been
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
the
savages
and
who
doubtless
had
been
tortured
to
death
probably
burned
we
are
expecting
the
to
arrive
in
a
day
or
two
i
hope
that
it
will
bring
me
a
good
long
letter
from
you
otherwise
i
do
not
feel
particularly
interested
in
her
arrival
unless
by
you
should
be
on
board
you
might
just
as
well
be
here
as
not
i
hope
to
begin
another
article
if
the
spirit
is
favorable
mouth
of
rosebud
june
look
on
my
map
and
you
will
find
our
present
location
on
the
yellowstone
about
midway
between
tongue
river
and
the
big
horn
the
has
returned
they
saw
the
trail
and
deserted
camp
of
a
village
of
three
hundred
and
eighty
lodges
the
trail
was
about
one
week
old
the
scouts
reported
that
they
could
have
overtaken
the
village
in
one
day
and
a
half
i
am
now
going
to
take
up
the
trail
where
the
turned
back
i
fear
their
failure
to
follow
up
the
indians
has
imperilled
our
plans
by
giving
the
village
an
intimation
of
our
presence
think
of
the
valuable
time
lost
but
i
feel
hopeful
of
accomplishing
great
results
i
will
move
directly
up
the
valley
of
the
rosebud
general
gibbon
s
command
and
general
terry
with
steamer
will
proceed
up
the
big
horn
as
far
as
the
boat
can
go
i
like
campaigning
with
much
better
than
with
wagons
leaving
out
the
question
of
luxuries
we
take
no
tents
and
desire
none
i
now
have
some
crow
scouts
with
me
as
they
are
familiar
with
the
country
they
are
men
so
much
handsomer
and
more
than
any
we
have
ever
seen
and
so
jolly
and
sportive
nothing
of
the
gloomy
silent
about
them
they
have
formally
given
themselves
to
me
after
the
usual
talk
in
their
speech
they
said
they
had
heard
that
i
never
abandoned
a
trail
that
when
my
food
gave
out
i
ate
mule
that
was
the
kind
of
a
man
they
wanted
to
fight
under
they
were
willing
to
eat
mule
too
i
am
going
to
send
six
ree
scouts
to
powder
river
with
the
mail
from
there
it
will
go
with
other
scouts
to
fort
buford
june
i
have
but
a
few
moments
to
write
as
we
move
at
twelve
and
i
have
my
hands
full
of
preparations
for
the
scout
do
not
be
anxious
about
me
you
would
be
surprised
to
know
how
closely
i
obey
your
instructions
about
keeping
with
the
column
i
hope
to
have
a
good
report
to
send
you
by
the
next
mail
a
success
will
start
us
all
towards
lincoln
i
send
you
an
extract
from
general
terry
s
official
order
knowing
how
keenly
you
appreciate
words
of
commendation
and
confidence
such
as
the
following
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
give
you
any
definite
instructions
in
regard
to
this
movement
and
were
it
not
impossible
to
do
so
the
department
commander
places
too
much
confidence
in
your
zeal
energy
and
ability
to
wish
to
impose
upon
you
precise
orders
which
might
hamper
your
action
when
nearly
in
contact
with

transcriber
