chapter

the
cabin
in
the
valley
the
valley
lay
like
a
ribbon
thrown
into
the
midst
of
the
encompassing
hills
the
grass
which
grew
there
was
soft
and
fine
and
abundant
the
trees
which
sprang
from
its
dark
rich
mould
were
tall
and
great
of
girth
a
bright
stream
flashed
through
it
and
the
sunshine
fell
warm
upon
the
grass
and
changed
the
tassels
of
the
maize
into
golden
plumes
above
the
valley
east
and
north
and
south
rose
the
hills
clad
in
living
green
mantled
with
the
purpling
grape
wreathed
morn
and
eve
with
trailing
mist
to
the
westward
were
the
mountains
and
they
dwelt
apart
in
a
blue
haze
only
in
the
morning
if
the
mist
were
not
there
the
sunrise
struck
upon
their
long
summits
and
in
the
evening
they
stood
out
high
and
black
and
fearful
against
the
splendid
sky
the
child
who
played
beside
the
cabin
door
often
watched
them
as
the
valley
filled
with
shadows
and
thought
of
them
as
a
great
wall
between
her
and
some
land
of
the
fairies
which
must
needs
lie
beyond
that
barrier
beneath
the
splendor
and
the
evening
star
the
indians
called
them
the
endless
mountains
and
the
child
never
doubted
that
they
ran
across
the
world
and
touched
the
floor
of
heaven
in
the
hands
of
the
woman
who
was
spinning
the
thread
broke
and
the
song
died
in
the
white
throat
of
the
girl
who
stood
in
the
doorway
for
a
moment
the
two
gazed
with
widening
eyes
into
the
green
september
world
without
the
cabin
then
the
woman
sprang
to
her
feet
tore
from
the
wall
a
horn
and
running
to
the
door
wound
it
lustily
the
echoes
from
the
hills
had
not
died
when
a
man
and
a
boy
the
one
bearing
a
musket
the
other
an
axe
burst
from
the
shadow
of
the
forest
and
at
a
run
crossed
the
greensward
and
the
field
of
maize
between
them
and
the
women
the
child
let
fall
her
pine
cones
and
pebbles
and
fled
to
her
mother
to
cling
to
her
skirts
and
look
with
brown
frightened
eyes
for
the
wonder
that
should
follow
the
winding
of
the
horn
only
twice
could
she
remember
that
clear
summons
for
her
father
once
when
it
was
winter
and
snow
was
on
the
ground
and
a
great
wolf
gaunt
and
bold
had
fallen
upon
their
sheep
and
once
when
a
drunken
trader
from
germanna
with
a
pamunkey
who
had
tasted
of
the
trader
rum
had
not
waited
for
an
invitation
before
entering
the
cabin
it
was
not
winter
now
and
there
was
no
sign
of
the
trader
or
of
the
dreadful
capering
indian
there
was
only
a
sound
in
the
air
a
strange
noise
coming
to
them
from
the
pass
between
the
hills
over
which
rose
the
sun
the
man
with
the
musket
sent
his
voice
before
him
as
he
approached
the
group
upon
the
doorstep
alce
woman
what
amiss
i
see
naught
wrong
his
wife
stepped
forward
to
meet
him
there
naught
to
see
william
it
to
hear
there
was
a
noise
molly
and
i
heard
it
and
then
we
lost
it
there
it
is
again
fronting
the
cabin
beyond
the
maize
field
and
the
rich
green
grass
and
the
placid
stream
rose
two
hills
steep
and
thickly
wooded
and
between
them
ran
a
narrow
winding
and
rocky
pass
down
this
gorge
to
the
listening
pioneer
now
came
a
confused
and
trampling
sound
it
is
iron
striking
against
the
rocks
he
announced
the
hoofs
of
horses
iron
cried
his
wife
the
horses
in
virginia
go
unshod
and
what
should
a
troop
of
horse
do
here
beyond
the
frontier
where
even
the
rangers
never
come
the
man
shook
his
head
a
frown
of
perplexity
upon
his
bronzed
and
bearded
face
it
is
the
sound
of
the
hoofs
of
horses
he
said
and
they
are
coming
through
the
pass
hark
a
trumpet
blew
and
there
came
a
noise
of
laughter
the
child
pressed
close
to
her
brother
side
oh
robin
maybe
is
the
fairies
out
from
the
gloom
of
the
pass
into
the
sunshine
of
the
valley
splashing
through
the
stream
trampling
the
long
grass
laughing
and
calling
one
rider
to
the
other
burst
a
company
of
fifty
horsemen
the
trumpet
blew
again
and
the
entire
party
drawing
rein
stared
at
the
unexpected
maize
field
the
cabin
and
the
people
about
the
door
between
the
intruders
and
the
lonely
folk
whose
nearest
neighbors
were
twenty
miles
away
was
only
a
strip
of
sunny
grass
dotted
over
with
the
stumps
of
trees
that
had
been
felled
lest
they
afford
cover
for
attacking
savages
a
man
riding
at
the
head
of
the
invading
party
beckoned
somewhat
imperiously
to
the
pioneer
and
the
latter
still
with
his
musket
in
the
hollow
of
his
arm
strode
across
the
greensward
and
finding
himself
in
the
midst
not
of
rude
traders
and
rangers
but
of
easy
smiling
periwigged
gentlemen
handsomely
dressed
and
accoutred
dropped
the
butt
of
his
gun
upon
the
ground
and
took
off
his
cap
you
are
deep
in
the
wilderness
good
fellow
said
the
man
who
had
beckoned
and
who
was
possessed
of
a
stately
figure
a
martial
countenance
and
an
air
of
great
authority
how
far
is
it
to
the
mountains
the
pioneer
stared
at
the
long
blue
range
cloudlike
in
the
distance
i
do
know
he
answered
i
hunt
to
the
eastward
twenty
miles
maybe
you
never
going
to
climb
them
we
are
come
out
expressly
to
do
so
answered
the
other
heartily
having
a
mind
to
drink
the
king
health
with
our
heads
in
the
clouds
we
need
another
axeman
to
clear
away
the
fallen
trees
and
break
the
nets
of
grapevine
wilt
go
along
amongst
our
rangers
yonder
and
earn
a
pistole
and
undying
fame
the
woodsman
looked
from
the
knot
of
gentlemen
to
the
troop
of
hardy
rangers
who
with
a
dozen
ebony
servants
and
four
meherrin
indians
made
up
the
company
under
charge
of
the
slaves
were
a
number
of
packhorses
thrown
across
one
was
a
noble
deer
a
second
bore
a
brace
of
wild
turkeys
and
a
bear
fat
and
tender
a
third
had
a
legion
of
pots
and
pans
for
the
cooking
of
the
woodland
cheer
while
the
burden
of
several
others
promised
heart
content
of
good
liquor
from
the
entire
troop
breathed
a
most
enticing
air
of
gay
daring
and
the
gentlemen
were
young
and
of
cheerful
countenances
the
rangers
in
the
rear
sat
their
horses
and
whistled
to
the
woodpeckers
in
the
the
negroes
grinned
broadly
even
the
indians
appeared
a
shade
less
saturnine
than
usual
the
golden
sunshine
poured
upon
them
all
and
the
blue
mountains
that
no
englishman
had
ever
passed
seemed
for
the
moment
as
soft
and
yielding
as
the
cloud
that
slept
along
their
summits
and
no
man
knew
what
might
be
just
beyond
the
mountains
frenchmen
certainly
and
the
great
lakes
and
the
south
sea
but
besides
these
might
there
not
be
gold
glittering
stones
new
birds
and
beasts
and
plants
strange
secrets
of
the
hills
it
was
only
for
a
week
or
two
with
good
company
and
good
drink
the
woodsman
shifted
from
one
foot
to
the
other
but
his
wife
who
had
now
crossed
the
grass
to
his
side
had
no
doubts
you
not
go
william
she
cried
remember
the
smoke
that
you
saw
yesterday
from
the
hilltop
if
the
northern
indians
are
on
the
warpath
against
the
southern
and
are
passing
between
us
and
the
mountains
there
may
be
straying
bands
i
not
let
you
go
in
her
eagerness
she
clasped
his
arm
with
her
hands
she
was
a
comely
buxom
dame
and
the
circle
on
horseback
being
for
the
most
part
young
and
gallant
and
not
having
seen
a
woman
for
some
days
looked
kindly
upon
her
and
so
you
saw
a
smoke
goodwife
and
are
afraid
of
roving
indians
said
the
gentleman
who
had
spoken
before
that
being
the
case
your
husband
has
our
permission
to
stay
behind
on
my
life
is
a
shame
to
ride
away
and
leave
you
in
danger
of
such
marauders
will
your
excellency
permit
me
to
volunteer
for
guard
duty
demanded
a
young
man
who
had
pressed
his
horse
to
the
leader
side
it
odds
though
that
when
you
return
this
way
you
find
me
turned
papist
swear
your
excellency
never
saw
in
flanders
carved
or
painted
saint
so
worthy
of
your
prayers
as
yonder
breathing
one
the
girl
molly
had
followed
her
parents
and
now
stood
upon
a
little
grassy
knoll
surveying
with
wide
brown
eyes
the
gay
troop
before
her
a
light
wind
was
blowing
and
it
wrapped
her
dress
of
tender
faded
blue
around
her
young
limbs
and
lifted
her
loosened
hair
gilded
by
the
sunshine
into
the
likeness
of
an
aureole
her
face
was
serious
and
wondering
but
fair
as
a
woodland
flower
she
had
placed
her
hand
upon
the
head
of
the
child
who
was
with
her
clinging
to
her
dress
the
green
knoll
formed
a
pedestal
behind
was
the
sky
as
blue
as
that
of
italy
the
two
figures
might
have
been
some
painted
the
sprightly
company
which
had
taken
for
its
motto
sic
juvat
transcendere
montes
looked
and
worshiped
there
was
a
moment
of
silent
devotion
broken
by
one
of
the
gentlemen
demanding
if
were
not
time
for
dinner
another
remarked
that
they
might
go
much
farther
and
fare
much
worse
in
respect
of
a
cool
sweet
spot
in
which
to
rest
during
the
heat
of
the
afternoon
and
a
third
boldly
proposed
that
they
go
no
farther
at
all
that
day
their
leader
settled
the
question
by
announcing
that
mason
suggestion
finding
favor
in
his
sight
they
would
forthwith
dismount
dine
drink
red
wine
and
white
and
wear
out
the
heat
of
the
day
in
this
sylvan
paradise
until
four
of
the
clock
when
the
trumpet
should
sound
for
the
mount
also
that
if
the
goodwife
and
her
daughter
would
do
them
the
honor
to
partake
of
their
rustic
fare
their
healths
should
be
drunk
in
nothing
less
than
burgundy
as
he
spoke
he
swung
himself
from
the
saddle
pulled
out
his
ruffles
and
raised
his
hat
ladies
permit
me
a
wave
of
his
hand
toward
his
escort
who
were
now
also

foot

at
your
service
the
pioneer
standing
behind
his
wife
plucked
her
by
the
sleeve
ecod
alce
is
the
governor
himself
mind
your
manners
alce
who
had
been
a
dairymaid
in
a
great
house
in
england
needed
no
admonition
her
curtsy
was
profound
and
when
the
governor
took
her
by
the
hand
and
kissed
her
still
blooming
cheek
she
curtsied
again
molly
who
had
no
memories
of
fine
gentlemen
and
the
complaisance
which
was
their
due
blushed
at
the
touch
of
his
excellency
lips
forgot
to
curtsy
and
knew
not
where
to
look
when
in
her
confusion
she
turned
her
head
aside
her
eyes
met
those
of
the
young
man
who
had
threatened
to
turn
papist
he
bowed
with
his
hand
upon
his
heart
and
she
blushed
more
deeply
than
before
by
now
every
man
had
dismounted
and
the
valley
was
ringing
with
the
merriment
of
the
jovial
crew
the
negroes
led
the
horses
down
the
stream
lightened
them
of
saddle
and
bridle
and
left
them
tethered
to
saplings
beneath
which
the
grass
grew
long
and
green
the
rangers
gathered
fallen
wood
and
kindled
two
mighty
fires
while
the
gentlemen
of
the
party
threw
themselves
down
beside
the
stream
upon
a
little
grassy
rise
shadowed
by
a
huge
a
mound
of
turf
flanked
by
two
spreading
roots
was
the
governor
chair
of
state
and
alce
and
molly
he
must
needs
seat
beside
him
not
one
of
his
gay
company
but
seemed
an
adept
in
the
compliment
of
the
age
out
of
very
idleness
and
the
mirth
born
of
that
summer
hour
they
followed
his
excellency
lead
and
plied
the
two
simple
women
with
all
the
wordy
ammunition
that
a
tolerable
acquaintance
with
the
mythology
of
the
ancients
and
the
polite
literature
of
the
present
could
furnish
the
mother
and
daughter
did
not
understand
the
fine
speeches
but
liked
them
passing
well
in
their
lonely
lives
a
little
thing
made
conversation
for
many
and
many
a
day
as
for
these
golden
hours
the
jingle
and
clank
and
mellow
laughter
the
ruffles
and
gold
buttons
and
fine
cloth
these
gentlemen
young
and
handsome
the
taste
of
wine
the
taste
of
flattery
the
sunshine
that
surely
was
never
yet
so
bright
ten
years
from
now
they
would
still
be
talking
of
these
things
still
wishing
that
such
a
day
could
come
again
the
negroes
were
now
busy
around
the
fires
and
soon
the
cheerful
odor
of
broiling
meat
rose
and
blended
with
the
fragrance
of
the
forest
the
pioneer
hospitably
minded
beckoned
to
the
four
meherrins
and
hastening
with
them
to
the
patch
of
waving
corn
returned
with
a
goodly
lading
of
plump
green
ears
a
second
foraging
party
under
guidance
of
the
boy
brought
into
the
larder
of
the
gentry
half
a
dozen
noble
melons
golden
within
and
without
the
woman
whispered
to
the
child
and
the
latter
ran
to
the
cabin
filled
her
upgathered
skirts
with
the
loaves
of
her
baking
and
came
back
to
the
group
upon
the
knoll
beneath
the
the
governor
himself
took
the
bread
from
the
little
maid
then
drew
her
toward
him
thanks
my
pretty
one
he
said
with
a
smile
that
for
the
moment
quite
dispelled
the
expression
of
haughtiness
which
marred
an
otherwise
comely
countenance
come
give
me
a
kiss
sweeting
and
tell
me
thy
name
the
child
looked
at
him
gravely
my
name
is
audrey
she
answered
and
if
you
eat
all
of
our
bread
we
have
none
for
supper
the
governor
laughed
and
kissed
the
small
dark
face
i
give
thee
a
gold
moidore
instead
my
maid
odso
as
dark
and
wild
almost
as
was
my
little
queen
of
the
saponies
that
died
last
year
hast
never
been
away
from
the
mountains
child
audrey
shook
her
head
and
thought
the
question
but
a
foolish
one
the
mountains
were
everywhere
had
she
not
been
to
the
top
of
the
hills
and
seen
for
herself
that
they
went
from
one
edge
of
the
world
to
the
other
she
was
glad
to
slip
from
the
governor
encircling
arm
and
from
the
gay
ring
beneath
the
to
take
refuge
with
herself
down
by
the
water
side
and
watch
the
fairy
tale
from
afar
off
the
rangers
with
the
pioneer
and
his
son
for
their
guests
dined
beside
the
kitchen
fire
which
they
had
kindled
at
a
respectful
distance
from
the
group
upon
the
knoll
active
bronzed
and
daring
men
wild
riders
bold
fighters
lovers
of
the
freedom
of
the
woods
they
sprawled
upon
the
dark
earth
beneath
the
laughed
and
joked
and
told
old
tales
of
hunting
or
of
indian
warfare
the
four
meherrins
ate
apart
and
in
stately
silence
but
the
grinning
negroes
must
needs
endure
their
hunger
until
their
masters
should
be
served
one
black
detachment
spread
before
the
gentlemen
of
the
expedition
a
damask
cloth
another
placed
upon
the
snowy
field
platters
of
smoking
venison
and
turkey
flanked
by
rockahominy
and
corn
roasted
indian
fashion
golden
melons
and
a
quantity
of
wild
grapes
gathered
from
the
vines
that
rioted
over
the
hillside
while
a
third
set
down
with
due
solemnity
a
formidable
array
of
bottles
there
being
no
chaplain
in
the
party
the
grace
was
short
the
two
captains
carved
but
every
man
was
his
own
ganymede
the
wines
were
good
and
abundant
there
was
champagne
for
the
king
health
claret
in
which
to
pledge
themselves
gay
stormers
of
the
mountains
burgundy
for
the
oreads
who
were
so
gracious
as
to
sit
beside
them
smile
upon
them
taste
of
their
mortal
fare
sooth
to
say
the
oreads
were
somewhat
dazed
by
the
company
they
were
keeping
and
found
the
wine
a
more
potent
brew
than
the
liquid
crystal
of
their
mountain
streams
red
roses
bloomed
in
molly
cheeks
her
eyes
grew
starry
and
no
longer
sought
the
ground
when
one
of
the
gentlemen
wove
a
chaplet
of
oak
leaves
and
with
it
crowned
her
loosened
hair
she
laughed
and
the
sound
was
so
silvery
and
delightful
that
the
company
laughed
with
her
when
the
viands
were
gone
the
negroes
drew
the
cloth
but
left
the
wine
when
the
wine
was
spent
they
brought
to
their
masters
long
pipes
and
japanned
boxes
filled
with
the
fragrant
smoke
arising
wrapped
the
knoll
in
a
bluish
haze
a
wind
had
arisen
tempering
the
blazing
sunshine
and
making
low
music
up
and
down
the
hillsides
the
maples
blossomed
into
silver
the
restless
poplar
leaves
danced
more
and
more
madly
the
hemlocks
and
great
white
pines
waved
their
broad
dark
banners
above
the
hilltops
the
sky
was
very
blue
and
the
distant
heights
seemed
dream
mountains
and
easy
of
climbing
a
soft
and
pleasing
indolence
born
of
the
afternoon
the
sunlight
and
the
red
wine
came
to
dwell
in
the
valley
one
of
the
company
beneath
the
spreading
laid
his
pipe
upon
the
grass
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
with
his
eyes
on
the
azure
heaven
showing
between
branch
and
leaf
sang
the
song
of
amiens
of
such
another
tree
in
such
another
forest
the
voice
was
manly
strong
and
sweet
the
rangers
quit
their
talk
of
war
and
hunting
to
listen
and
the
negroes
down
by
the
fire
which
they
had
built
for
themselves
laughed
for
very
pleasure
when
the
wine
was
all
drunken
and
the
smoke
of
the
tobacco
quite
blown
away
a
gentleman
who
seemed
of
a
somewhat
saturnine
disposition
and
less
susceptible
than
his
brother
adventurers
to
the
charms
of
the
wood
nymphs
rose
and
declared
that
he
would
go
in
the
dark
crystal
of
the
stream
below
his
servant
brought
him
hook
and
line
while
the
grasshoppers
in
the
tall
grass
served
for
bait
a
rock
jutting
over
the
flood
formed
a
convenient
seat
and
a
lent
a
grateful
shade
the
fish
were
abundant
and
obliging
the
fisherman
was
happy
three
shining
trophies
had
been
landed
and
he
was
in
the
act
of
baiting
the
hook
that
should
capture
the
fourth
when
his
eyes
chanced
to
meet
the
eyes
of
the
child
audrey
who
had
left
her
covert
of
alder
and
now
stood
beside
him
tithonus
green
and
hale
skipped
from
between
his
fingers
and
he
let
fall
his
line
to
put
out
a
hand
and
draw
the
child
down
to
a
seat
upon
the
rock
wouldst
like
to
try
thy
skill
moppet
he
demanded
the
child
shook
her
head
are
you
a
prince
she
asked
and
is
the
grand
gentleman
with
the
long
hair
and
the
purple
coat
the
king
the
fisherman
laughed
no
little
one
i
only
a
poor
ensign
the
gentleman
yonder
being
the
representative
in
virginia
of
my
lord
of
orkney
and
his
majesty
king
george
the
first
may
somewhat
smack
of
royalty
indeed
there
are
good
virginians
who
think
that
were
the
king
himself
amongst
us
he
could
not
more
thoroughly
play
my
lord
absolute
but
he
only
the
governor
of
virginia
after
all
bright
eyes
does
he
live
in
a
palace
like
the
king
my
father
once
saw
the
house
in
a
place
they
call
london
the
gentleman
laughed
again
ay
he
lives
in
a
palace
a
red
brick
palace
sixty
feet
long
and
forty
feet
deep
with
a
bauble
on
top
all
afire
on
there
are
green
gardens
too
with
winding
paths
and
sometimes
pretty
ladies
walk
in
them
wouldst
like
to
see
all
these
fine
things
the
child
nodded
ay
that
i
would
who
is
the
gentleman
that
sang
and
that
now
sits
by
molly
see
with
his
hand
touching
her
hair
is
he
a
governor
too
the
other
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
raised
his
eyebrows
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
returned
to
his
fishing
that
is
marmaduke
haward
he
said
who
having
just
come
into
a
great
estate
goes
abroad
next
month
to
be
taught
the
newest
most
genteel
mode
of
squandering
it
dost
not
like
his
looks
child
half
the
ladies
of
williamsburgh
are
enamored
of
his
audrey
made
no
answer
for
just
then
the
trumpet
blew
for
the
mount
and
the
fisherman
must
needs
draw
in
and
pocket
his
hook
and
line
clear
high
and
sweet
the
triumphant
notes
pierced
the
air
and
were
answered
from
the
hills
by
a
thousand
fairy
horns
the
governor
would
play
the
soldier
in
the
wilderness
his
little
troop
of
gentlemen
and
rangers
and
ebony
servants
had
come
out
well
drilled
for
their
tilt
against
the
mountains
the
echoes
were
still
ringing
when
with
laughter
some
expenditure
of
wit
and
much
cheerful
swearing
the
camp
was
struck
the
packhorses
were
again
laden
the
rangers
swung
themselves
into
their
saddles
and
the
gentlemen
beneath
the
rose
from
the
grass
and
tendered
their
farewells
to
the
oreads
alce
roundly
hoped
that
their
honors
would
pass
that
way
again
upon
their
return
from
the
high
mountains
and
the
deepening
rose
of
molly
cheeks
and
her
wistful
eyes
added
weight
to
her
mother
importunity
the
governor
swore
that
in
no
great
time
they
would
dine
again
in
the
valley
and
his
companions
confirmed
the
oath
his
excellency
turning
to
mount
his
horse
found
the
pioneer
at
the
animal
head
so
honest
fellow
he
exclaimed
you
will
not
with
us
to
grave
your
name
upon
the
mountain
tops
let
me
tell
you
that
you
are
giving
fame
the
to
march
against
the
mountains
and
overcome
them
as
though
they
were
so
many
frenchmen
and
then
to
gaze
into
the
promised
land
beyond
odso
man
we
are
as
great
as
were
cortez
and
pizarro
and
their
crew
we
are
heroes
and
paladins
we
are
the
knights
of
his
horse
impatient
to
be
gone
struck
with
a
ringing
sound
an
hoof
against
a
bit
of
rock
the
knights
of
the
horseshoe
said
the
gentleman
nearest
the
governor
spotswood
uttered
a
delighted
exclamation
haward
you
hit
it
the
first
horseshoes
used
in
virginia
the
number
we
were
forced
to
bring
along
the
sound
of
the
iron
against
the
rocks
the
knights
of
the
horseshoe
i
send
to
london
and
have
little
horseshoes
little
gold
horseshoes
made
and
every
man
of
us
shall
wear
one
the
knights
of
the
golden
horseshoe
it
hath
an
odd
charming
sound
eh
gentlemen
none
of
the
gentlemen
were
prepared
to
deny
that
it
was
a
quaint
and
pleasing
title
instead
out
of
very
lightness
of
heart
and
fantastic
humor
they
must
needs
have
the
burgundy
again
unpacked
that
they
might
pledge
at
once
all
valorous
discoverers
his
excellency
the
governor
of
virginia
and
their
order
and
when
the
wine
was
drunk
the
rangers
were
drawn
up
the
muskets
were
loaded
and
a
volley
was
fired
that
brought
the
echoes
crashing
about
their
heads
the
governor
mounted
the
trumpet
sounded
once
more
and
the
joyous
company
swept
down
the
narrow
valley
toward
the
long
blue
distant
ranges
the
pioneer
his
wife
and
children
watched
them
go
one
of
the
gentlemen
turned
in
his
saddle
and
waved
his
hand
alce
curtsied
but
molly
at
whom
he
had
looked
saw
him
not
because
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
the
company
reached
and
entered
a
cleft
between
the
hills
a
moment
and
men
and
horses
were
lost
to
sight
a
little
longer
and
not
even
a
sound
could
be
heard
it
was
as
though
they
had
taken
the
sunshine
with
them
for
a
cloud
had
come
up
from
the
west
and
the
sun
was
hidden
all
at
once
the
valley
seemed
a
sombre
and
lonely
place
and
the
hills
with
their
whispering
trees
looked
menacingly
down
upon
the
clearing
the
cabin
and
the
five
simple
english
folk
the
glory
of
the
day
was
gone
after
a
little
more
of
idle
staring
the
frontiersman
and
his
son
returned
to
their
work
in
the
forest
while
alce
and
molly
went
indoors
to
their
spinning
and
audrey
sat
down
upon
the
doorstep
to
listen
to
the
hurry
of
voices
in
the
trees
and
to
watch
the
shadow
of
the
cloud
above
the
valley
chapter
ii
the
court
of
the
orphan
an
hour
before
dusk
found
the
company
that
had
dined
in
the
valley
making
their
way
up
the
dry
bed
of
a
stream
through
a
gorge
which
cleft
a
line
of
precipitous
hills
on
either
hand
the
bank
rose
steeply
giving
no
footing
for
man
or
beast
the
road
was
a
difficult
one
for
here
a
tall
rock
left
but
a
narrow
passage
between
itself
and
the
shaggy
hillside
and
there
smooth
and
slippery
ledges
mounting
one
above
the
other
spanned
the
way
in
places
too
the
drought
had
left
pools
of
dark
still
water
difficult
to
avoid
and
not
infrequently
the
entire
party
must
come
to
a
halt
while
the
axemen
cleared
from
the
path
a
fallen
birch
or
hemlock
every
man
was
afoot
none
caring
to
risk
a
fall
upon
the
rocks
or
into
the
black
cold
water
of
the
pools
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
and
the
spurs
of
the
men
clanked
against
the
stones
now
and
then
one
of
the
heavily
laden
packhorses
stumbled
and
was
sworn
at
and
once
a
warning
rattle
issuing
from
a
rank
growth
of
fern
on
the
hillside
caused
a
momentary
commotion
there
was
no
more
laughter
or
whistling
or
calling
from
the
van
to
the
rear
guard
the
way
was
arduous
and
every
man
must
watch
his
footsteps
moreover
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
were
gilding
the
hilltops
above
them
and
the
level
that
should
form
their
must
be
reached
before
the
falling
of
the
night
the
sunlight
had
all
but
faded
from
the
heights
when
one
of
the
company
stumbling
over
a
round
and
mossy
rock
measured
his
length
upon
the
ground
amid
his
own
oaths
at
his
mishap
and
the
exclamations
of
the
man
immediately
in
his
rear
whose
progress
he
had
thus
unceremoniously
blocked
the
horse
of
the
fallen
man
startled
by
the
dragging
at
the
reins
reared
and
plunged
and
in
a
moment
the
entire
column
was
in
disorder
when
the
frightened
animals
were
at
last
quieted
and
the
line
the
governor
called
out
to
know
who
it
was
that
had
fallen
and
whether
any
damage
had
been
suffered
it
was
haward
sir
cried
two
or
three
and
presently
the
injured
gentleman
himself
limping
painfully
and
with
one
side
of
his
fine
green
coat
all
stained
by
reason
of
contact
with
a
bit
of
muddy
ground
appeared
before
his
excellency
i
have
had
a
cursed
mishap
saving
your
presence
sir
he
explained
the
right
ankle
is
i
fear
badly
sprained
the
pain
is
exquisite
and
i
know
not
how
i
am
to
climb
mountains
the
governor
uttered
an
exclamation
of
concern
unfortunate
robinson
must
look
to
the
hurt
at
once
your
excellency
forgets
my
dispute
with
robinson
as
to
the
dose
of
jesuit
bark
for
my
servant
said
the
sufferer
blandly
were
i
i
should
not
apply
to
him
for
relief
i
lay
my
life
that
you
are
not
now
retorted
the
doctor
if
ever
i
saw
a
man
with
a
sprained
ankle
keep
his
color
so
marvelously
or
heard
him
speak
in
so
composed
a
tone
the
pain
must
be
of
a
very
unusual
degree
indeed
it
is
answered
haward
calmly
i
can
not
possibly
go
on
in
this
condition
your
excellency
nor
can
i
dream
of
allowing
my
unlucky
accident
to
delay
this
worshipful
company
in
their
ascent
of
the
mountains
i
will
therefore
take
my
servant
and
ride
slowly
back
to
the
cabin
which
we
left
this
afternoon
doubtless
the
worthy
pioneer
will
give
me
shelter
until
my
foot
is
healed
and
i
will
rejoin
your
excellency
upon
your
return
through
the
valley
as
he
spoke
for
the
greater
ease
of
the
injured
member
he
leaned
against
a
towering
lock
he
was
a
handsome
youth
with
a
trick
of
keeping
an
unmoved
countenance
under
even
such
a
fire
of
laughter
and
exclamation
as
greeted
his
announcement
and
for
this
you
would
lose
the
passing
of
the
appalachian
mountains
cried
spotswood
why
man
from
those
heights
we
may
almost
see
lake
erie
may
find
out
how
near
we
are
to
the
french
how
easily
the
mountains
may
be
traversed
what
promise
of
success
should
his
majesty
determine
to
plant
settlements
beyond
them
or
to
hold
the
mountain
passes
there
is
service
to
be
done
and
honor
to
be
gained
and
you
would
lag
behind
because
of
a
wrenched
ankle
zoons
sir
at
blenheim
i
charged
a
whole
regiment
of
frenchmen
with
a
wound
in
my
breast
into
which
you
might
have
thrust
your
hand
the
younger
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
beggars
may
not
be
choosers
he
said
coolly
the
sunlight
is
fast
fading
and
if
we
would
be
out
of
this
gorge
before
nightfall
we
must
make
no
further
tarrying
i
have
your
excellency
permission
to
depart
one
of
the
gentlemen
made
a
but
audible
remark
to
his
neighbor
and
another
hummed
a
line
from
a
love
song
the
horses
moved
impatiently
amongst
the
loose
stones
and
the
rangers
began
to
mutter
that
night
would
be
upon
them
before
they
reached
a
safer
footing
haward
mr
haward
said
the
governor
sternly
it
is
in
my
mind
that
you
meditate
inflicting
a
greater
harm
than
you
have
received
let
me
tell
you
sir
if
you
think
to
so
repay
a
hospitality
haward
eyes
narrowed
i
own
colonel
spotswood
for
governor
of
virginia
he
said
speaking
slowly
as
was
his
wont
when
he
was
angry
his
office
does
not
i
think
extend
farther
than
that
as
for
these
gentlemen
who
are
not
protected
by
their
rank
i
beg
to
inform
them
that
in
my
fall
my
sword
arm
suffered
no
whit
turning
he
beckoned
to
a
negro
who
had
worked
his
way
from
the
servants
in
the
rear
along
the
line
of
rangers
to
the
outskirts
of
the
group
of
gentlemen
gathered
around
the
governor
and
the
injured
man
juba
he
ordered
draw
your
horse
and
mine
to
one
side
your
excellency
may
i
again
remind
you
that
it
draws
toward
nightfall
and
that
this
road
will
be
no
pleasant
one
to
travel
in
the
dark
what
he
said
was
true
moreover
upon
the
setting
out
of
the
expedition
it
had
been
laughingly
agreed
that
any
gentleman
who
might
find
his
spirits
dashed
by
the
dangers
and
difficulties
of
the
way
should
be
at
liberty
at
any
time
to
turn
his
back
upon
the
mountains
and
his
face
toward
safety
and
the
settlements
the
governor
frowned
bit
his
lips
but
finally
burst
into
unwilling
laughter
you
are
a
very
young
gentleman
marmaduke
haward
he
cried
were
you
a
little
younger
i
know
what
ointment
i
should
prescribe
for
your
hurt
go
your
ways
with
your
broken
ankle
but
if
when
i
come
again
to
the
cabin
in
the
valley
i
find
that
your
own
injury
has
not
contented
you
look
to
it
that
i
do
not
make
you
build
a
bridge
across
the
bay
itself
gentlemen
haward
is
bent
upon
intrusting
his
cure
to
other
and
softer
hands
than
robinson
and
the
expedition
must
go
forward
without
him
we
sorrow
to
lose
him
from
our
number
but
we
know
better
than
to
reason
with
ahem
a
twisted
ankle
gentlemen
haward
pray
have
a
care
of
yourself
i
would
advise
that
the
ankle
be
well
bandaged
and
that
you
stir
not
from
the
chimney
corner
i
thank
your
excellency
for
your
advice
said
haward
imperturbably
and
will
consider
of
taking
it
i
wish
your
excellency
and
these
merry
gentlemen
a
most
complete
victory
over
the
mountains
from
which
conquest
i
will
no
longer
detain
you
he
bowed
as
he
spoke
and
began
to
move
slowly
and
haltingly
across
the
width
of
the
rocky
way
to
where
his
negro
stood
with
the
two
horses
mr
haward
called
the
governor
the
recreant
turned
his
head
your
excellency
it
was
the
right
foot
was
it
not
queried
his
sometime
leader
ah
i
thought
so
then
it
were
best
not
to
limp
with
the
left
homeric
laughter
shook
the
air
but
while
haward
laughed
not
neither
did
he
frown
or
blush
i
will
remember
sir
he
said
simply
and
at
once
began
to
limp
with
the
proper
foot
when
he
reached
the
bank
he
turned
and
standing
with
his
arm
around
his
horse
neck
watched
the
company
which
he
had
so
summarily
deserted
as
it
put
itself
into
motion
and
went
slowly
past
him
up
its
dusky
road
the
laughter
and
bantering
farewells
moved
him
not
he
could
at
will
draw
a
line
around
himself
across
which
few
things
could
step
not
far
away
the
bed
of
the
stream
turned
and
a
hillside
dark
with
hemlock
closed
the
view
he
watched
the
train
pass
him
reach
this
bend
and
disappear
the
axemen
and
the
four
meherrins
the
governor
and
the
gentlemen
of
the
horseshoe
the
rangers
the
negroes
all
were
gone
at
last
with
that
passing
and
with
the
ceasing
of
the
laughter
and
the
trampling
came
the
twilight
a
whippoorwill
began
to
call
and
the
wind
sighed
in
the
trees
juba
the
negro
moved
closer
to
his
master
then
upon
an
impulse
stooped
and
lifting
above
his
head
a
great
rock
threw
it
with
might
into
one
of
the
shallow
pools
the
crashing
sound
broke
the
spell
of
the
loneliness
and
quiet
that
had
fallen
upon
the
place
the
white
man
drew
his
breath
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
his
horse
head
down
the
way
up
which
he
had
so
lately
come
the
cabin
in
the
valley
was
not
three
miles
away
down
this
ravine
to
a
level
place
of
pines
through
the
pines
to
a
strip
of
sassafras
and
a
poisoned
field
past
these
into
a
dark
rich
wood
of
mighty
trees
linked
together
with
the
ripening
grape
then
three
low
hills
then
the
valley
and
the
cabin
and
a
pair
of
starry
eyes
it
was
full
moon
once
out
from
under
the
stifling
walls
of
the
ravine
and
the
silver
would
tremble
through
the
leaves
and
show
the
path
beneath
the
trees
too
that
they
had
blazed
with
white
wood
pointing
to
white
wood
the
backward
way
should
be
easy
the
earth
rising
sheer
in
darkness
on
either
hand
shut
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
in
the
warm
scented
dusk
the
locusts
shrilled
in
the
trees
and
far
up
the
gorge
the
whippoorwill
called
and
called
the
air
was
filled
with
the
gold
of
fireflies
a
maze
of
spangles
now
darkening
now
brightening
restless
and
bewildering
the
small
round
pools
caught
the
light
from
the
yet
faintly
colored
sky
and
gleamed
among
the
rocks
a
star
shone
out
and
a
hot
wind
heavy
with
the
smell
of
the
forest
moved
the
hemlock
boughs
and
rustled
in
the
laurels
the
white
man
and
the
negro
each
leading
his
horse
picked
their
way
with
caution
among
the
pitfalls
of
the
rocky
and
uneven
road
with
the
passing
of
the
governor
and
his
train
a
sudden
cure
had
been
wrought
for
now
haward
step
was
as
firm
and
light
as
it
had
been
before
his
fall
the
negro
looked
at
him
once
or
twice
with
a
puzzled
face
but
made
no
comment
and
received
no
enlightenment
indeed
so
difficult
was
their
way
that
they
were
left
but
scant
leisure
for
speech
moment
by
moment
the
darkness
deepened
and
once
haward
horse
came
to
its
knees
crashing
down
among
the
rocks
and
awakening
every
echo
the
way
if
hard
was
short
the
hills
fell
farther
apart
the
banks
became
low
and
broad
and
fair
in
front
between
two
slender
pines
shone
out
the
great
round
moon
leaving
the
bed
of
the
stream
the
two
men
entered
a
pine
wood
dim
and
fragrant
and
easy
to
thread
the
moon
rose
higher
and
the
light
fell
in
wide
shafts
between
trees
that
stood
well
apart
with
no
vines
to
grapple
one
to
another
or
undergrowth
to
press
about
their
knees
there
needed
no
watchfulness
the
ground
was
smooth
the
light
was
fair
no
motion
save
the
pale
flicker
of
the
fireflies
no
sound
save
the
sigh
of
the
night
wind
in
the
boughs
that
were
so
high
overhead
master
and
man
riding
slowly
and
steadily
onward
through
a
wood
that
seemed
interminably
the
same
came
at
last
to
think
of
other
things
than
the
road
which
they
were
traveling
their
hands
lost
grasp
upon
the
reins
and
their
eyes
ceasing
to
glance
now
here
now
there
gazed
steadfastly
down
the
gray
and
dreamlike
vista
before
them
and
saw
no
longer
hole
and
branch
moonlight
and
the
white
scars
that
the
axe
had
made
for
guidance
the
vision
of
the
slave
was
of
supper
at
the
quarters
of
the
scraping
of
the
fiddle
in
the
red
firelight
of
the
dancing
and
the
singing
the
white
man
saw
at
first
only
a
girl
face
shy
and
innocent
the
face
of
the
woodland
maid
who
had
fired
his
fancy
who
was
drawing
him
through
the
wilderness
back
to
the
cabin
in
the
valley
but
after
a
while
in
the
gray
stillness
he
lost
the
face
and
suddenly
thought
instead
of
the
stone
that
was
to
cover
his
father
grave
the
ship
that
was
to
bring
the
great
dark
carven
slab
should
be
in
by
now
the
day
after
his
return
to
williamsburgh
the
stone
must
be
put
in
place
covering
in
the
green
sod
and
that
which
lay
below
lieth
in
the
hope
of
a
joyful
his
mind
left
the
grave
in
the
churchyard
at
williamsburgh
and
visited
the
great
plantation
of
which
he
was
now
sole
master
there
was
the
house
foursquare
built
of
dark
red
brick
that
glowed
behind
the
veil
of
the
walnuts
and
the
oaks
there
too
were
the
quarters
the
home
quarter
that
at
the
creek
that
on
the
ridge
fifty
white
servants
three
hundred
slaves
and
he
was
the
master
the
honeysuckles
in
the
garden
that
had
been
his
father
pride
the
shining
expanse
of
the
river
the
ship
his
ship
the
golden
rose
that
was
to
take
him
home
to
england
he
forgot
the
night
and
the
forest
and
saw
these
things
quite
plainly
then
he
fell
to
thinking
of
london
and
the
sweets
that
he
meant
to
taste
the
heady
wine
of
youth
and
life
that
he
meant
to
drain
to
the
lees
he
was
young
he
could
spare
the
years
one
day
he
would
come
back
to
virginia
to
the
dim
old
garden
and
quiet
house
his
factor
would
give
account
and
he
would
settle
down
in
the
red
brick
house
with
the
tobacco
to
the
north
and
east
the
corn
to
the
west
and
to
the
south
the
mighty
river
the
river
silvered
by
the
moon
the
river
that
lay
just
beyond
him
gleaming
through
the
trees
startled
by
the
sudden
tightening
of
the
reins
or
by
the
tearing
of
some
frightened
thing
through
the
canes
that
beset
the
low
miry
bank
the
horse
sprang
aside
then
stood
trembling
with
pricked
ears
the
white
man
stared
at
the
stream
turned
in
his
saddle
and
stared
at
the
tree
trunks
the
patches
of
moonlight
and
the
impenetrable
shadow
that
closed
each
vista
the
blazed
trees
he
exclaimed
at
last
how
long
since
we
saw
one
the
slave
shook
his
head
juba
forgot
to
look
he
was
away
by
a
river
that
he
knew
we
have
passed
from
out
the
pines
said
haward
these
are
oaks
but
what
is
that
water
and
how
far
we
are
out
of
our
reckoning
the
lord
only
knows
as
he
spoke
he
pushed
his
horse
through
the
tall
reeds
to
the
bank
of
the
stream
here
in
the
open
away
from
the
shadow
of
the
trees
the
full
moon
had
changed
the
into
a
wonderful
silver
day
narrow
above
and
belows
the
stream
widened
before
him
into
a
fairy
basin
rimmed
with
reeds
unruffled
stiller
than
a
dream
the
trees
that
grew
upon
the
farther
side
were
faint
gray
clouds
in
the
moonlight
and
the
gold
of
the
fireflies
was
very
pale
from
over
the
water
out
of
the
heart
of
the
moonlit
wood
came
the
song
of
a
mockingbird
a
tumultuous
ecstasy
possessing
the
air
and
making
elfin
the
night
haward
backed
his
horse
from
the
reeds
to
the
oak
beneath
which
waited
the
negro
is
plain
that
we
have
lost
our
way
juba
he
said
with
a
laugh
if
you
were
an
indian
we
should
turn
and
straightway
retrace
our
steps
to
the
blazed
trees
being
what
you
are
you
are
more
valuable
in
the
tobacco
fields
than
in
the
forest
perhaps
this
is
the
stream
which
flows
by
the
cabin
in
the
valley
we
follow
it
down
and
so
arrive
at
least
at
a
conclusion
they
dismounted
and
leading
their
horses
followed
the
stream
for
some
distance
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
it
was
not
the
one
beside
which
they
had
dined
that
day
when
they
were
certain
of
this
they
turned
and
made
their
way
back
to
the
line
of
reeds
which
they
had
broken
to
mark
their
by
now
the
moon
was
high
and
the
mockingbird
in
the
wood
across
the
water
was
singing
madly
turning
from
the
still
moonlit
sheet
the
silent
reeds
the
clear
mimicker
in
the
slumbrous
wood
the
two
wayfarers
plunged
into
the
darkness
beneath
the
spreading
branches
of
the
they
could
not
have
ridden
far
from
the
pines
in
a
very
little
while
they
might
reach
and
recognize
the
path
which
they
should
tread
an
hour
later
the
great
trees
oak
and
chestnut
beech
and
poplar
suddenly
gave
way
to
saplings
many
and
overrun
with
grapevines
so
dense
was
the
growth
so
unyielding
the
curtain
of
vines
that
men
and
horses
were
brought
to
a
halt
as
before
a
fortress
wall
again
they
turned
and
skirting
that
stubborn
network
came
upon
a
swamp
where
leafless
trees
white
as
leprosy
stood
up
like
ghosts
from
the
water
that
gleamed
between
the
leaving
the
swamp
they
climbed
a
hill
and
at
the
summit
found
only
the
moon
and
the
stars
and
a
long
plateau
of
sighing
grass
behind
them
were
the
great
mountains
before
them
lesser
heights
wooded
hills
narrow
valleys
each
like
its
fellow
each
indistinct
and
shadowy
with
no
sign
of
human
tenant
haward
gazed
at
the
climbing
moon
and
at
the
wide
and
universal
dimness
of
the
world
beneath
then
turned
to
the
negro
and
pointed
to
a
few
low
trees
growing
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
plateau
fasten
the
horses
there
juba
he
said
we
will
wait
upon
this
hilltop
until
morning
when
the
light
comes
we
may
be
able
to
see
the
clearing
or
the
smoke
from
the
cabin
when
the
horses
had
been
tethered
master
and
man
lay
down
upon
the
grass
it
was
so
still
upon
the
hilltop
and
the
heavens
pressed
so
closely
that
the
slave
grew
restless
and
strove
to
make
talk
failing
in
this
he
began
to
croon
a
savage
mournful
air
and
presently
forgetting
himself
to
sing
outright
be
quiet
ordered
his
master
there
may
be
indians
abroad
the
song
came
to
an
end
as
abruptly
as
it
lad
begun
and
the
singer
having
nothing
better
to
do
went
fast
asleep
his
companion
more
wakeful
lay
with
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
his
eyes
upon
the
splendor
of
the
firmament
lying
so
he
could
not
see
the
valleys
nor
the
looming
mountains
there
were
only
the
dome
of
the
sky
the
grass
and
himself
he
stared
at
the
moon
and
made
pictures
of
her
shadowy
places
then
fell
to
thinking
of
the
morrow
and
of
the
possibility
that
after
all
he
might
never
find
again
the
cabin
in
the
valley
while
he
laughed
at
this
supposition
yet
he
played
with
it
he
was
in
a
mood
to
think
the
loss
of
the
trail
of
the
expedition
no
great
matter
the
woods
were
full
of
game
the
waters
of
fish
he
and
juba
had
only
to
keep
their
faces
to
the
eastward
and
a
fortnight
at
most
would
bring
them
to
the
settlements
but
the
valleys
folded
among
the
hills
were
many
what
if
the
one
he
sought
should
still
elude
him
what
if
the
cabin
the
the
crystal
stream
had
sunk
from
sight
like
the
city
in
one
of
monsieur
fantastic
tales
perhaps
they
had
done
so
the
spot
had
all
the
air
of
a
bit
of
fairyland
and
the
woodland
maid
was
gone
to
walk
with
the
elves
well
perchance
for
her
it
would
be
better
so
and
yet
it
would
be
pleasant
if
she
should
climb
the
hillside
now
and
sit
beside
him
with
her
shy
dark
eyes
and
floating
hair
her
hair
was
long
and
fine
and
the
wind
would
lift
it
her
face
was
fair
and
another
than
the
wind
should
kiss
it
the
night
would
not
then
be
so
slow
in
going
he
turned
upon
his
side
and
looked
along
the
grassy
summit
to
the
woods
upon
the
opposite
slope
and
to
the
distant
mountains
dull
silver
immutable
perpetual
they
reared
themselves
to
meet
the
moonbeams
between
him
and
those
stern
and
changeless
fronts
pallid
as
with
snows
stretched
the
gray
woods
the
moon
shone
very
brightly
and
there
was
no
wind
so
unearthly
was
the
quiet
of
the
night
so
solemn
the
light
so
high
and
still
and
calm
the
universe
around
him
that
awe
fell
upon
his
soul
it
was
well
to
lie
upon
the
hilltop
and
guess
at
the
riddle
of
the
world
now
dimly
to
see
the
meaning
now
to
lose
it
quite
to
wonder
to
think
of
death
the
easy
consciousness
that
for
him
death
was
scores
of
years
away
that
he
should
not
meet
the
spectre
until
the
wine
was
all
drunken
the
garlands
withered
and
he
the
guest
ready
to
depart
made
these
speculations
not
at
all
unpleasing
he
looked
at
his
hand
blanched
by
the
moonlight
lying
beside
him
upon
the
grass
and
thought
how
like
a
dead
hand
it
seemed
and
what
if
he
could
not
move
it
nor
his
body
nor
could
ever
rise
from
the
grass
but
must
lie
there
upon
the
lonely
hilltop
in
the
untrodden
wilderness
until
that
which
had
ridden
and
hunted
and
passed
so
buoyantly
through
life
should
become
but
a
few
dry
bones
a
handful
of
dust
he
was
of
his
time
and
its
laxness
of
principle
and
conduct
if
he
held
within
himself
the
potential
scholar
statesman
and
philosopher
there
were
also
the
skeptic
the
egotist
and
the
libertine
he
followed
the
fashion
and
disbelieved
much
but
he
knew
that
if
he
died
his
soul
would
not
stay
with
his
body
upon
the
hilltop
he
wondered
somewhat
grimly
what
it
would
do
when
so
much
that
had
clothed
it
round
pride
of
life
love
of
pleasure
desire
ambition
should
be
plucked
away
poor
soul
surely
it
would
feel
itself
something
shrunken
stripped
of
warmth
shiveringly
bare
to
all
the
winds
of
heaven
the
radiance
of
the
moon
usurped
the
sky
but
behind
that
veil
of
light
the
invisible
and
multitudinous
stars
were
shining
beyond
those
stars
were
other
stars
beyond
those
yet
others
on
and
on
went
the
stars
wise
men
said
beyond
them
all
what
then
and
where
was
the
place
of
the
soul
what
would
it
do
what
heaven
or
hell
would
it
find
or
make
for
itself
guesswork
all
the
silver
pomp
of
the
night
began
to
be
oppressive
to
him
there
was
beauty
but
it
was
a
beauty
cold
and
distant
infinitely
withdrawn
from
man
and
his
concerns
woods
and
mountains
held
aloof
communing
with
the
stars
they
were
kindred
and
of
one
house
it
was
man
who
was
alien
a
stranger
and
alone
the
hilltop
cared
not
that
he
lay
thereon
the
grass
would
grow
as
greenly
when
he
was
in
his
grave
all
his
tragedies
since
time
began
he
might
reenact
there
below
and
the
mountains
would
not
bend
to
look
he
flung
his
arm
across
his
eyes
to
shut
out
the
moonlight
and
tried
to
sleep
finding
the
attempt
a
vain
one
and
that
the
night
pressed
more
and
more
heavily
upon
him
he
sat
up
with
the
intention
of
shaking
the
negro
awake
and
so
providing
himself
with
other
company
than
his
own
thoughts
his
eyes
had
been
upon
the
mountains
but
now
with
the
sudden
movement
he
faced
the
eastern
horizon
and
a
long
cleft
between
the
hills
far
down
this
opening
something
was
on
fire
burning
fiercely
and
redly
some
one
must
have
put
torch
to
the
forest
and
yet
it
did
not
burn
as
trees
burn
it
was
like
a
bonfire
it
was
a
bonfire
in
a
clearing
there
were
not
woods
about
it
but
a
field
and
the
glint
of
water
the
negro
awakened
by
foot
and
voice
sprang
up
and
stood
bewildered
beside
his
master
it
is
the
valley
that
we
have
been
seeking
juba
said
the
latter
speaking
rapidly
and
low
that
burning
pile
is
the
cabin
and
is
like
that
there
are
indians
between
us
and
it
leave
the
horses
we
shall
go
faster
without
them
look
to
the
priming
of
your
gun
and
make
no
noise
now
rapidly
descending
the
hill
they
threw
themselves
into
the
woods
at
its
base
here
they
could
not
see
the
fire
but
now
and
then
as
they
ran
they
caught
the
glow
far
down
the
lines
of
trees
though
they
went
swiftly
they
went
warily
as
well
keeping
an
eye
and
ear
open
and
muskets
ready
but
there
was
no
sound
other
than
their
own
quick
footfalls
upon
the
floor
of
rotting
leaves
or
the
eager
brushing
of
their
bodies
through
occasional
undergrowth
no
sight
but
the
serried
trees
and
the
checkered
light
and
shade
upon
the
ground
they
came
to
the
shallow
stream
that
flashed
through
the
valley
and
crossing
it
found
themselves
on
cleared
ground
with
only
a
long
strip
of
corn
between
them
and
what
had
been
a
home
for
english
folk
it
was
that
no
longer
for
lack
of
fuel
the
flames
were
dying
down
there
was
only
a
charred
and
smoking
pile
out
of
which
leaped
here
and
there
a
red
tongue
haward
had
expected
to
hear
a
noise
of
savage
triumph
and
to
see
dark
figures
moving
about
their
handiwork
there
was
no
noise
and
the
moonlight
showed
no
living
being
the
night
was
changelessly
still
and
bright
the
tragedy
had
been
played
and
the
mountains
and
the
hills
and
the
running
water
had
not
looked
it
took
but
a
few
minutes
to
break
through
the
rustling
corn
and
reach
the
smouldering
logs
once
before
them
there
seemed
naught
to
do
but
to
stand
and
stare
at
the
ruin
until
a
tongue
of
flame
caught
upon
a
piece
of
uncharred
wood
and
showed
them
the
body
of
the
pioneer
lying
at
a
little
distance
from
the
stone
that
had
formed
his
doorstep
at
a
sign
from
haward
the
negro
went
and
turned
it
over
then
let
it
sink
again
into
the
seared
grass
two
arrows
marse
duke
he
said
coming
back
to
the
other
side
an
they
taken
his
scalp
three
times
haward
made
the
round
of
the
yet
burning
heap
was
it
only
ruined
and
fallen
walls
or
was
it
a
funeral
pyre
as
well
to
know
he
must
wait
for
the
day
and
until
the
fire
had
burned
itself
out
if
the
former
were
the
case
if
the
dead
man
alone
kept
the
valley
then
now
through
the
forest
and
the
moonlight
captives
were
being
haled
to
some
indian
village
and
to
a
fate
more
terrible
than
that
of
the
man
who
lay
there
upon
the
grass
with
an
arrow
through
his
heart
if
the
girl
were
still
alive
yet
was
she
dead
to
him
he
was
no
quixote
to
tilt
with
windmills
had
a
way
to
rescue
her
lain
fair
before
him
he
would
have
risked
his
life
without
a
thought
but
the
woods
were
deep
and
pathless
and
only
an
indian
could
find
and
keep
a
trail
by
night
to
challenge
the
wilderness
to
strike
blindly
at
the
forest
now
here
now
there
to
dare
all
and
know
that
it
was
hopeless
daring
a
madman
might
do
this
for
love
but
it
was
only
haward
fancy
that
had
been
touched
and
if
he
lacked
not
courage
neither
did
he
lack
a
certain
cool
good
sense
which
divided
for
him
the
possible
from
that
which
was
impossible
and
therefore
not
to
be
undertaken
turning
from
the
ruin
he
walked
across
the
trampled
sward
to
the
in
whose
shade
in
the
golden
afternoon
he
had
sung
to
his
companions
and
to
a
simple
girl
idle
and
happy
and
far
from
harm
had
the
valley
seemed
here
shall
he
see
no
enemy
but
winter
and
rough
weather
suddenly
he
found
that
he
was
trembling
and
that
a
sensation
of
faintness
and
of
dull
and
sick
revolt
against
all
things
under
the
stars
was
upon
him
sitting
down
in
the
shadow
of
the
tree
he
rested
his
face
in
his
hands
and
shut
his
eyes
preferring
the
darkness
within
to
that
outer
night
which
hid
not
and
cared
not
which
was
so
coldly
at
peace
he
was
young
and
though
stories
of
such
dismal
things
as
that
before
him
were
part
of
the
stock
in
trade
of
every
ancient
garrulous
man
or
woman
of
his
acquaintance
they
had
been
for
him
but
tales
not
horrible
truths
to
stare
him
in
the
face
he
had
seen
his
father
die
but
he
had
died
in
his
bed
and
like
one
who
went
to
sleep
the
negro
had
followed
him
and
now
stood
with
his
eyes
upon
the
dying
flames
muttering
to
himself
some
heathenish
charm
when
it
was
ended
he
looked
about
him
uneasily
for
a
time
then
bent
and
plucked
his
master
by
the
sleeve
we
cyarn
do
nothin
here
marse
duke
he
whispered
the
wolves
may
get
the
horses
with
a
laugh
and
a
groan
the
young
man
rose
to
his
feet
that
is
true
juba
he
said
it
all
over
here
we
were
too
late
and
it
not
a
pleasant
place
to
lie
awake
in
waiting
for
the
morning
we
go
back
to
the
hilltop
leaving
the
tree
they
struck
across
the
grass
and
entered
the
strip
of
corn
something
low
and
dark
that
had
lain
upon
the
ground
started
up
before
them
and
ran
down
the
narrow
way
between
the
stalks
haward
made
after
it
and
caught
it
child
he
cried
where
are
the
others
the
child
had
struggled
for
a
moment
desperately
if
weakly
but
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
she
lay
still
in
his
grasp
with
her
eyes
upon
his
face
in
the
moonlight
each
could
see
the
other
quite
plainly
raising
her
in
his
arms
haward
bore
her
to
the
brink
of
the
stream
laved
her
face
and
chafed
the
small
cold
hands
now
tell
me
audrey
he
said
at
last
audrey
is
your
name
is
it
cry
if
you
like
child
but
try
to
tell
me
audrey
did
not
cry
she
was
very
very
tired
and
she
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
the
indians
came
she
told
him
in
a
whisper
with
her
head
upon
his
breast
we
all
waked
up
and
father
fired
at
them
through
the
hole
in
the
door
then
they
broke
the
door
down
and
he
went
outside
and
they
killed
him
mother
put
me
under
the
bed
and
told
me
to
stay
there
and
to
make
no
noise
then
the
indians
came
in
at
the
door
and
killed
her
and
molly
and
robin
i
do
remember
anything
after
that
maybe
i
went
to
sleep
when
i
was
awake
again
the
indians
were
gone
but
there
was
fire
and
smoke
everywhere
i
was
afraid
of
the
fire
and
so
i
crept
from
under
the
bed
and
kissed
mother
and
molly
and
robin
and
left
them
lying
in
the
cabin
and
came
away
she
sighed
with
weariness
and
the
hand
with
which
she
put
back
her
dark
hair
that
had
fallen
over
her
face
was
almost
too
heavy
to
lift
i
sat
beside
father
and
watched
the
fire
she
said
and
then
i
heard
you
and
the
black
man
coming
over
the
stones
in
the
stream
i
thought
that
you
were
indians
and
i
went
and
hid
in
the
corn
her
voice
failed
and
her
eyelids
drooped
in
some
anxiety
haward
watched
her
breathing
and
felt
for
the
pulse
in
the
slight
brown
wrist
then
satisfied
he
lifted
the
light
burden
and
nodding
to
the
negro
to
go
before
recommenced
his
progress
to
the
hill
which
he
had
left
an
hour
agone
it
was
not
far
away
he
could
see
the
bare
summit
above
the
treetops
and
in
a
little
while
they
were
upon
its
slope
a
minute
more
and
they
came
to
the
clump
of
trees
and
found
the
horses
in
safety
haward
paused
to
take
from
the
roll
strapped
behind
his
saddle
a
riding
cloak
then
leaving
the
negro
with
the
horses
climbed
to
the
grassy
level
here
he
spread
the
cloak
upon
the
ground
and
laid
the
sleeping
child
upon
it
which
done
he
stood
and
looked
at
his
charge
for
a
moment
then
turning
began
to
pace
up
and
down
upon
the
hilltop
it
was
necessary
to
decide
upon
a
course
of
action
they
had
the
horses
the
two
muskets
powder
and
shot
the
earth
was
dry
and
warm
and
the
skies
were
cloudless
was
it
best
to
push
on
to
germanna
or
was
it
best
to
wait
down
there
in
the
valley
for
the
return
of
the
governor
and
his
party
they
would
come
that
way
that
was
certain
and
would
look
to
find
him
there
if
they
found
only
the
ruined
cabin
they
might
think
him
dead
or
taken
by
the
indians
and
an
attempt
to
seek
him
as
dangerous
perhaps
as
fruitless
might
be
made
he
decided
that
he
would
wait
he
would
take
juba
and
the
horses
and
the
child
and
go
down
into
the
valley
not
back
to
the
and
that
yet
smouldering
pyre
but
to
the
woods
on
this
side
of
the
stream
this
plan
thought
out
he
went
and
took
his
seat
beside
the
child
she
was
moaning
in
her
sleep
and
he
bent
over
and
soothed
her
when
she
was
quiet
he
still
kept
her
hand
in
his
as
he
sat
there
waiting
for
the
dawn
he
gave
the
child
small
thought
together
he
and
juba
must
care
for
her
until
they
could
rejoin
the
expedition
then
the
governor
who
was
so
fond
of
children
might
take
her
in
hand
and
give
her
for
nurse
old
dominick
who
was
as
gentle
as
a
woman
once
at
germanna
perhaps
some
scolding
would
take
her
for
the
sake
of
the
scrubbing
and
lifting
to
be
gotten
out
of
those
small
hands
and
that
slender
frame
if
not
she
must
on
to
williamsburgh
and
the
keeping
of
the
vestry
there
the
next
orphan
court
would
bind
her
to
some
master
or
mistress
who
might
or
might
not
be
kind
to
her
and
so
there
would
be
an
end
to
the
matter
the
day
was
breaking
moon
and
stars
were
gone
and
the
east
was
dull
pink
like
faded
roses
a
ribbon
of
silver
mist
marking
the
course
of
the
stream
below
drew
itself
like
a
serpent
through
the
woods
that
were
changing
from
gray
to
green
the
dank
smell
of
early
morning
rose
from
the
earth
and
in
the
countless
trees
of
the
forest
the
birds
began
to
sing
a
word
or
phrase
which
is
as
common
and
familiar
as
our
hand
may
in
some
one
minute
of
time
take
on
a
significance
and
present
a
face
so
keen
and
strange
that
it
is
as
if
we
had
never
met
it
before
an
orphan
court
again
he
said
the
words
to
himself
and
then
aloud
no
doubt
the
law
did
its
best
for
the
fatherless
and
motherless
for
such
waifs
and
strays
as
that
which
lay
beside
him
when
it
bound
out
children
it
was
most
emphatic
that
they
should
be
fed
and
clothed
and
taught
not
starved
or
beaten
unduly
or
let
to
grow
up
ignorant
as
negroes
sometimes
the
law
was
obeyed
sometimes
not
the
roses
in
the
east
bloomed
again
and
the
pink
of
their
petals
melted
into
the
clear
blue
of
the
upper
skies
because
their
beauty
compelled
him
haward
looked
at
the
heavens
the
court
of
the
orphan
my
father
and
my
mother
forsake
me
the
lord
taketh
me
haward
acknowledged
with
surprise
that
portions
of
the
psalter
did
somehow
stick
in
the
memory
the
face
of
the
child
was
dark
and
thin
but
the
eyes
were
large
and
there
was
promise
in
the
mouth
it
was
a
pity
he
looked
at
her
again
and
suddenly
resolved
that
he
marmaduke
haward
would
provide
for
her
future
when
they
met
once
more
he
should
tell
the
governor
and
his
brother
adventurers
as
much
and
if
they
chose
to
laugh
why
let
them
do
so
he
would
take
the
child
to
williamsburgh
with
him
and
get
some
woman
to
tend
her
until
he
could
find
kind
and
decent
folk
with
whom
to
bestow
her
there
were
the
new
minister
of
fair
view
parish
and
his
wife
they
might
do
he
would
give
them
two
thousand
pounds
of
a
year
for
the
child
maintenance
oh
she
should
be
well
cared
for
he
would
if
he
thought
of
it
send
her
gifts
from
london
and
when
she
was
grown
and
asked
in
marriage
he
would
give
her
for
dowry
a
hundred
acres
of
land
as
the
strengthening
rays
of
the
sun
shining
alike
upon
the
just
and
the
unjust
warmed
his
body
so
his
own
benevolence
warmed
his
heart
he
knew
that
he
was
doing
a
generous
thing
and
his
soul
felt
in
tune
with
the
beamy
light
the
caroling
of
the
birds
the
freshness
and
fragrance
of
the
morning
when
at
last
the
child
awoke
and
the
recollection
of
the
night
coming
full
upon
her
clung
to
him
weeping
and
trembling
he
put
his
arm
around
her
and
comforted
her
with
all
the
pet
names
his
memory
could
conjure
up

in
virginia
there
were
colonel
robert
carter
president
of
the
council
and
governor
the
council
itself
and
mistress
martha
jaquelin
by
virtue
of
her
good
looks
and
sprightliness
the
position
of
her
father
in
the
community
and
the
fact
that
this
of
may
was
one
and
the
same
with
her
sixteenth
birthday
young
mistress
jaquelin
was
may
queen
in
jamestown
and
because
her
father
was
a
worthy
gentleman
and
a
gay
one
with
french
blood
in
his
veins
and
virginia
hospitality
in
his
heart
he
had
made
a
feast
for
divers
of
his
acquaintances
and
moreover
had
provided
in
a
grassy
meadow
down
by
the
water
side
a
noble
and
seasonable
entertainment
for
them
and
for
the
handful
of
townsfolk
and
for
all
chance
comers
meadow
and
woodland
and
marsh
ploughed
earth
and
blossoming
orchards
lay
warm
in
the
sunshine
even
the
ruined
town
fallen
from
her
estate
and
become
but
as
a
handmaid
to
her
younger
sister
put
a
good
face
upon
her
melancholy
fortunes
honeysuckle
and
ivy
embraced
and
hid
crumbling
walls
broken
foundations
mounds
of
brick
and
rubbish
all
the
untouched
memorials
of
the
last
burning
of
the
place
grass
grew
in
the
street
and
the
silent
square
was
strewn
with
the
gold
of
the
buttercups
the
houses
that
yet
stood
and
were
lived
in
might
have
been
counted
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
with
the
thumb
for
the
church
but
in
their
gardens
the
flowers
bloomed
gayly
and
the
sycamores
and
mulberries
in
the
churchyard
were
haunts
of
song
the
dead
below
had
music
and
violets
in
the
blowing
grass
and
the
undertone
of
the
river
perhaps
they
liked
the
peace
of
the
town
that
was
dead
as
they
were
dead
that
like
them
had
seen
of
the
travail
of
life
and
now
with
shut
eyes
and
folded
hands
knew
that
it
was
vanity
but
the
jaquelin
house
was
built
to
the
eastward
of
the
churchyard
and
the
ruins
of
the
town
and
facing
the
sparkling
river
squarely
turned
its
back
upon
the
quiet
desolation
at
the
upper
end
of
the
island
and
upon
the
text
from
ecclesiastes
in
the
level
meadow
around
a
maypole
gay
with
garlands
and
with
fluttering
ribbons
the
grass
had
been
closely
mown
for
there
were
to
be
and
wrestling
bouts
for
the
amusement
of
the
guests
beneath
a
spreading
tree
a
dozen
fiddlers
put
their
instruments
in
tune
while
behind
the
open
windows
of
a
small
ruinous
house
dwelt
in
by
the
sexton
a
rustic
choir
was
trying
over
the
beggar
daughter
of
bednall
green
young
men
and
maidens
of
the
meaner
sort
drawn
from
the
surrounding
country
from
small
plantation
store
and
ordinary
mill
and
ferry
clad
in
their
holiday
best
and
prone
to
laughter
strayed
here
and
there
or
walking
up
and
down
the
river
bank
where
it
commanded
a
view
of
both
the
landing
and
the
road
watched
for
the
coming
of
the
gentlefolk
children
too
were
not
lacking
but
rolled
amidst
the
buttercups
or
caught
at
the
ribbons
flying
from
the
maypole
while
aged
folk
sat
in
the
sun
and
a
procession
of
negroes
carrying
benches
and
chairs
advanced
to
the
shaven
green
and
put
the
seats
in
order
about
the
sylvan
stage
it
was
but
nine
of
the
clock
and
the
shadow
of
the
maypole
was
long
upon
the
grass
along
the
slightly
rising
ground
behind
the
meadow
stretched
an
apple
orchard
in
full
bloom
and
between
that
line
of
rose
and
snow
and
the
lapping
of
the
tide
upon
the
yellow
sands
lay
for
the
length
of
a
spring
day
the
kingdom
of
all
content
the
shadow
of
the
maypole
was
not
much
shrunken
when
the
guests
of
the
house
of
jaquelin
began
to
arrive
first
to
come
and
from
farthest
away
was
richard
ambler
of
yorktown
who
had
ridden
from
that
place
to
williamsburgh
the
afternoon
before
and
had
that
morning
used
the
planter
pace
to
jamestown
his
industry
being
due
to
the
fact
that
he
was
courting
the
may
queen
elder
sister
following
him
came
five
lees
in
a
chariot
then
a
delegation
of
burwells
then
two
digges
in
a
chaise
a
bland
and
a
bassett
and
a
randolph
came
on
horseback
while
a
barge
brought
up
river
a
bevy
of
blooming
carters
a
sloop
from
warwick
landed
a
dozen
carys
great
and
small
and
two
periaguas
filled
with
harrisons

and
cockes
shot
over
from
the
surrey
shore
from
a
stand
at
one
end
of
the
grassy
stage
trumpet
and
drum
proclaimed
that
the
company
had
gathered
beneath
the
sycamores
before
the
house
and
was
about
to
enter
the
meadow
mothers
warned
their
children
from
the
maypole
the
fiddlers
ceased
their
twanging
and
pretty
bessee
her
name
cut
in
twain
died
upon
the
air
the
throng
of
humble
folk
largely
made
up
of
contestants
for
the
prizes
of
the
day
and
of
their
friends
and
kindred
scurried
to
its
appointed
place
and
with
the
issuing
from
the
house
gates
of
the
may
queen
and
her
court
the
festivities
commenced
an
hour
later
in
the
midst
of
a
bout
at
quarterstaff
between
the
jamestown
blacksmith
and
the
miller
from
princess
creek
a
coach
and
four
accompanied
by
a
horseman
crossed
the
neck
rolled
through
the
street
and
entering
the
meadow
drew
up
a
hundred
feet
from
the
ring
of
spectators
the
eyes
of
the
commonalty
still
hung
upon
every
motion
of
the
blacksmith
and
the
miller
but
by
the
people
of
quality
the
cudgelers
were
for
the
moment
quite
forgot
the
head
of
the
house
of
jaquelin
hurried
over
the
grass
to
the
coach
door
ha
colonel
byrd
when
we
heard
that
you
were
staying
overnight
at
green
spring
we
hoped
that
being
so
near
you
would
come
to
our
merrymaking
mistress
evelyn
i
kiss
your
hands
though
we
ca
give
you
the
diversions
of
spring
garden
yet
such
as
we
have
are
at
your
feet
marmaduke
haward
your
servant
sir
virginia
has
missed
you
these
ten
years
and
more
we
were
heartily
glad
to
hear
day
that
the
golden
rose
had
brought
you
home
as
he
spoke
the
worthy
gentleman
strove
to
open
the
coach
door
but
the
horseman
to
whom
the
latter
part
of
his
speech
was
addressed
and
who
had
now
dismounted
was
beforehand
with
him
the
door
swung
open
and
a
young
lady
of
a
delicate
and
pensive
beauty
placed
one
hand
upon
the
deferential
arm
of
marmaduke
haward
and
descended
from
the
painted
coach
to
the
sward
the
women
amongst
the
assembled
guests
fluttered
and
whispered
for
this
was
youth
beauty
wealth
london
and
the
court
all
drawn
in
the
person
of
mistress
evelyn
byrd
bred
since
childhood
in
the
politest
society
of
england
newly
returned
with
her
father
to
his
estate
of
westover
in
virginia
and
from
her
garlanded
gypsy
hat
to
the
point
of
her
silken
shoe
suggestive
of
the
rainbow
world
of
her
father
alert
vivacious
handsome
with
finely
cut
lips
that
were
quick
to
smile
and
dark
eyes
that
smiled
when
the
lips
were
still
followed
her
to
the
earth
shook
out
his
ruffles
and
extended
his
gold
snuffbox
to
his
good
friend
jaquelin
the
gentleman
who
had
ridden
beside
the
coach
threw
the
reins
of
his
horse
to
one
of
the
negroes
who
had
come
running
from
the
jaquelin
stables
and
together
with
their
host
the
three
walked
across
the
strip
of
grass
to
the
row
of
expectant
gentry
down
went
the
lady
until
the
skirt
of
her
gown
lay
in
folds
upon
the
buttercups
down
went
the
ladies
opposite
in
curtsies
as
profound
if
less
exquisitely
graceful
off
came
the
hats
of
the
gentlemen
the
bows
were
of
the
lowest
snuffboxes
were
drawn
out
handkerchiefs
of
fine
holland
flourished
the
welcoming
speeches
were
hearty
and
not
unpolished
it
was
a
society
less
provincial
than
that
of
more
than
one
shire
that
was
nearer
to
london
by
a
thousand
leagues
it
dwelt
upon
the
banks
of
the
chesapeake
and
of
great
rivers
ships
dropped
their
anchors
before
its
very
doors
now
and
again
the
planter
followed
his
tobacco
aboard
the
sands
did
not
then
run
so
swiftly
through
the
hourglass
if
the
voyage
to
england
was
long
why
so
was
life
the
planters
went
sold
their
tobacco
dees
oronoko
cowpen
talked
with
their
agents
visited
their
english
kindred
saw
the
town
the
opera
and
the
play
perhaps
afar
off
the
king
and
returned
to
virginia
and
their
plantations
with
the
last
but
one
novelty
in
ideas
manner
and
dress
of
their
sons
not
a
few
were
educated
in
english
schools
while
their
wives
and
daughters
if
for
the
most
part
they
saw
the
enchanted
ground
only
through
the
eyes
of
husband
father
or
brother
yet
followed
its
fashions
when
learned
with
religious
zeal
in
williamsburgh
where
all
men
went
on
occasion
there
was
polite
enough
living
there
were
the
college
the
capitol
and
the
playhouse
the
palace
was
a
toy
james
the
governors
that
came
and
went
almost
as
proper
gentlemen
fitted
to
rule
over
english
people
as
if
they
had
been
born
in
hanover
and
could
not
speak
their
subjects
tongue
so
it
was
that
the
assembly
which
had
risen
to
greet
jaquelin
latest
guests
besides
being
sufficiently
well
born
was
not
at
all
ill
bred
nor
uninformed
nor
untraveled
but
it
was
not
of
the
gay
world
as
were
the
three
whom
it
welcomed
it
had
spent
only
months
not
years
in
england
it
had
never
kissed
the
king
hand
it
did
not
know
bath
nor
the
wells
it
was
innocent
of
drums
and
routs
and
masquerades
had
not
even
a
speaking
acquaintance
with
great
lords
and
ladies
had
never
supped
with
pope
or
been
grimly
smiled
upon
by
the
dean
of
patrick
or
courted
by
the
earl
of
peterborough
it
had
not
like
the
elder
of
the
two
men
studied
in
the
low
countries
visited
the
court
of
france
and
contracted
friendships
with
men
of
illustrious
names
nor
like
the
younger
had
it
written
a
play
that
ran
for
two
weeks
fought
a
duel
in
the
field
of
forty
footsteps
and
lost
and
won
at
the
cocoa
tree
between
the
lighting
and
snuffing
of
the
candles
three
thousand
pounds
therefore
it
stood
slightly
in
awe
of
the
wit
and
manners
and
fine
feathers
curled
newest
fashion
of
its
sometime
friends
and
neighbors
and
its
welcome
if
warm
at
heart
was
stiff
as
cloth
of
gold
with
ceremony
the
may
queen
tripped
in
her
speech
as
she
besought
mistress
evelyn
to
take
the
great
chair
standing
proudly
forth
from
the
humbler
seats
and
colored
charmingly
at
the
lady
of
fashion
smiling
shake
of
the
head
and
few
graceful
words
of
homage
the
young
men
slyly
noted
the
length
of
the
colonel
periwig
and
the
quality
of
mechlin
while
their
elders
suddenly
lacking
material
for
discourse
made
shift
to
take
a
deal
of
snuff
the
colonel
took
matters
into
his
own
capable
hands
jaquelin
i
wish
that
my
tobacco
at
westover
may
look
as
finely
a
fortnight
hence
as
does
yours
there
promise
to
be
more
frenchmen
in
my
fields
than
germans
at
james
gary
if
i
come
to
denbigh
when
the
peaches
are
ripe
will
you
teach
me
to
make
persico
allen
i
hear
that
you
breed
cocks
as
courageous
as
those
of
tanagra
i
shall
borrow
from
you
for
a
fight
that
i
mean
to
give
ladies
for
how
much
gold
will
you
sell
the
recipe
for
that
balm
of
mecca
you
must
use
there
are
dames
at
court
would
come
barefoot
to
virginia
for
so
dazzling
a
bloom
why
do
you
patch
only
upon
the
whig
side
of
the
face
are
you
all
of
one
camp
and
does
not
one
of
you
grow
a
white
rosebush
against
the
of
may
may
it
please
your
majesty
the
may
queen
i
shall
watch
the
sports
from
this
seat
upon
your
right
hand
egad
the
miller
quits
himself
as
though
he
were
the
fellow
of
sherwood
forest
the
ice
had
thawed
and
by
the
time
the
victorious
miller
had
been
pushed
forward
to
receive
the
smart
cocked
hat
which
was
the
virginia
rendition
of
the
crown
of
wild
olive
it
had
quite
melted
conversation
became
general
and
food
was
found
or
made
for
laughter
when
the
twelve
fiddlers
who
succeeded
the
blacksmith
and
the
miller
came
trooping
upon
the
green
they
played
one
by
one
to
perhaps
as
a
company
as
a
may
day
ever
shone
upon
all
their
tunes
were
gay
and
lively
ones
and
the
younger
men
moved
their
feet
to
the
music
while
a
strephon
at
the
lower
end
of
the
lists
seized
upon
a
blooming
chloe
and
the
two
began
to
dance
as
if
quoth
the
colonel
the
musicians
were
so
many
tarantula
doctors
a
instrument
of
his
calling
went
to
the
player
of
the
sprightliest
air
after
which
awardment
the
fiddlers
each
to
the
tune
of
his
own
choosing
marched
off
the
green
to
make
room
for
pretty
bessee
her
father
the
beggar
and
her
suitors
the
innkeeper
the
merchant
the
gentleman
and
the
knight
the
high
quick
notes
of
the
song
suited
the
sunshiny
weather
the
sheen
of
the
river
the
azure
skies
a
light
wind
brought
from
the
orchard
a
vagrant
troop
of
pink
and
white
petals
to
camp
upon
the
silken
sleeve
of
mistress
evelyn
byrd
the
gentleman
sitting
beside
her
gathered
them
up
and
gave
them
again
to
the
breeze
it
sounds
sweetly
enough
he
said
but
terribly
weigh
not
true
love
by
the
weight
of
the
purse
and
beauty
is
beauty
in
every
degree
that
not
court
doctrine
the
lady
to
whom
he
spoke
rested
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
and
looked
past
the
singers
to
the
blossoming
slope
and
the
sky
above
so
much
the
worse
for
the
court
she
said
so
much
the
better
for
haward
glanced
at
her
for
virginia
he
ended
with
a
smile
do
you
think
that
they
do
not
weigh
love
with
gold
here
in
virginia
evelyn
it
is
really
arcady
so
much
the
better
for
some
place
somewhere
she
answered
quietly
i
did
not
say
virginia
indeed
from
what
travelers
like
yourself
have
told
me
i
think
the
country
lies
not
upon
this
earth
but
the
story
is
at
an
end
and
we
must
applaud
with
the
rest
it
sounded
sweetly
after
all
though
it
was
only
a
lying
song
what
next
her
father
from
his
station
beside
the
may
queen
caught
the
question
and
broke
the
flow
of
his
smiling
compliments
to
answer
it
a
race
between
young
girls
my
love
the
lucky
fair
who
proves
her
descent
from
atalanta
to
find
not
a
golden
apple
but
a
golden
guinea
here
come
from
the
sexton
house
the
pretty
light
o
heels
the
crowd
gentle
and
simple
arose
and
pushed
back
all
benches
stools
and
chairs
so
as
to
enlarge
the
circumference
of
the
ring
and
the
six
girls
who
were
to
run
stepped
out
upon
the
green
the
youngest
son
of
the
house
of
jaquelin
checked
them
off
in
a
shrill
treble
the

the

darden
audrey
a
tall
thin
grave
gentleman
standing
behind

gave
an
impatient
jerk
of
his

and
said
something
beneath
his
breath
haward
looked
over
his
shoulder
ha
mr

i
did
not
know
you

i
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing

will
neither

go
of

the

and

he
paused
for

mistress
evelyn
took
her
eyes
from
the
group
of
those
about
to
run
and
opened
her
fan
a
careless
father
at
least
she
said
if
he
hath
learning
he
should
know
better
than
to
set
his
daughter
there
she
not
his
own
she
an
orphan
bound
to
darden
and
his
wife
i
suppose
there
some
story
or
other
about
her
but
not
being
curious
in
darden
affairs
i
have
never
learned
it
when
i
came
to
virginia
five
years
ago
she
was
a
slip
of
a
girl
of
thirteen
or
so
once
when
i
had
occasion
to
visit
darden
she
waylaid
me
in
the
road
as
i
was
riding
away
and
asked
me
how
far
it
was
to
the
mountains
and
if
there
were
indians
between
them
and
us
did
she
so
asked
haward
and
which
is
audrey
the
dark
one
brown
as
a
gypsy
with
the
dogwood
in
her
hair
and
mark
me
there
be
darden
own
luck
and
she
win
she
fleeter
than
a
greyhound
i
seen
her
running
in
and
out
and
to
and
fro
in
the
forest
like
a
wild
thing
bare
of
foot
and
slender
ankle
bare
of
arm
and
shoulder
with
heaving
bosom
shut
lips
and
steady
eyes
each
of
the
six
runners
awaited
the
trumpet
sound
that
should
send
her
forth
like
an
arrow
to
the
goal
and
to
the
shining
guinea
that
lay
thereby
the
spectators
ceased
to
talk
and
laugh
and
bent
forward
watching
wagers
had
been
laid
and
each
man
kept
his
eyes
upon
his
favorite
measuring
her
chances
the
trumpet
blew
and
the
race
was
on
when
it
was
over
and
won
the
may
queen
rose
from
her
seat
and
crossed
the
grass
to
her
fine
lady
guest
there
are
left
only
the
prizes
for
this
and
for
the
boys
race
and
for
the
best
dancer
will
you
not
give
them
mistress
evelyn
and
so
make
them
of
more
value
more
curtsying
more
complimenting
and
the
gold
was
in
evelyn
white
hand
the
trumpet
blew
the
drum
beat
the
fiddlers
swung
into
a
quick
staccato
air
and
darden
audrey
leaving
the
post
which
she
had
touched
some
seconds
in
advance
of
the
foremost
of
those
with
whom
she
had
raced
came
forward
to
receive
the
guinea
the
straight
short
skirt
of
dull
blue
linen
could
not
hide
the
lines
of
the
young
limbs
beneath
the
thin
white
sleeveless
bodice
showed
the
tint
of
the
flesh
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
bosom
the
bare
feet
trod
the
grass
lightly
and
firmly
the
brown
eyes
looked
from
under
the
dogwood
chaplet
in
a
gaze
that
was
serious
innocent
and
unashamed
to
audrey
they
were
only
people
out
of
a
fairy
tale
all
those
gay
folk
dressed
in
silks
and
with
curled
hair
they
lived
in
great
houses
and
men
and
women
were
born
to
till
their
fields
to
row
their
boats
to
doff
hats
or
curtsy
as
they
passed
they
were
not
real
if
you
pricked
them
they
would
not
bleed
in
the
mountains
that
she
remembered
as
a
dream
there
were
pale
masses
of
bloom
far
up
among
the
cliffs
very
beautiful
but
no
more
to
be
gained
than
the
moon
or
than
rainbow
gold
she
looked
at
the
may
party
before
which
she
had
been
called
much
as
when
a
child
she
had
looked
at
the
gorgeous
distant
bloom
not
without
longing
perhaps
but
indifferent
too
knowing
that
it
was
beyond
her
reach
when
the
gold
piece
was
held
out
to
her
she
took
it
having
earned
it
when
the
little
speech
with
which
the
lady
gave
the
guinea
was
ended
she
was
ready
with
her
curtsy
and
her
thank
you
the
red
came
into
her
cheeks
because
she
was
not
used
to
so
many
eyes
upon
her
but
she
did
not
blush
for
her
bare
feet
nor
for
her
dress
that
had
slipped
low
over
her
shoulder
nor
for
the
fact
that
she
had
run
her
swiftest
five
times
around
the
maypole
all
for
the
love
of
a
golden
guinea
and
for
mere
youth
and
ignorance
and
the
springtime
in
the
pulses
the
gold
piece
lay
within
her
brown
fingers
a
thought
too
lightly
for
as
she
stepped
back
from
the
row
of
gentlefolk
it
slid
from
her
hand
to
the
ground
a
gentleman
sitting
beside
the
lady
who
had
spoken
to
her
stooped
and
picking
up
the
money
gave
it
again
into
her
hand
though
she
curtsied
to
him
she
did
not
look
at
him
but
turned
away
glad
to
be
quit
of
all
the
eyes
and
in
a
moment
had
slipped
into
the
crowd
from
which
she
had
come
it
was
midday
and
old
israel
the
fisherman
who
had
brought
her
and
the
widow
constance
barbara
up
the
river
in
his
boat
would
be
going
back
with
the
tide
she
was
not
loath
to
leave
the
green
meadow
the
gaudy
maypole
and
the
music
were
good
but
the
silence
on
the
river
the
shadow
of
the
brooding
forest
the
darting
of
the
fish
hawk
were
better
in
the
meadow
the
boys
race
and
the
rustic
dance
were
soon
over
the
dinner
at
the
jaquelin
house
to
its
guests
lasted
longer
but
it
too
was
hurried
for
in
the
afternoon
harrison
mare
nelly
was
to
run
against
major
burwell
fearnaught
and
the
stakes
were
heavy
not
all
of
the
company
went
from
the
banquet
back
to
the
meadow
where
the
humbler
folk
having
eaten
their
dinner
of
bread
and
meat
and
ale
were
whiling
away
with
sports
of
their
own
the
hour
before
the
race
colonel
byrd
had
business
at
williamsburgh
and
must
reach
his
lodgings
there
an
hour
before
sunset
his
four
black
horses
brought
to
the
door
the
great
coach
an
ebony
coachman
in
scarlet
cracked
his
whip
at
a
couple
of
negro
urchins
who
had
kept
pace
with
the
vehicle
as
it
lumbered
from
the
stables
and
a
light
brown
footman
flung
open
the
door
and
lowered
the
steps
the
colonel
much
regretting
that
occasion
should
call
him
away
vowed
that
he
had
never
spent
a
pleasanter
may
day
kissed
the
may
queen
hand
and
was
prodigal
of
compliments
like
the
gay
and
gallant
gentleman
that
he
was
his
daughter
made
her
graceful
adieux
in
her
clear
low
and
singularly
sweet
voice
and
together
they
were
swallowed
up
of
the
mammoth
coach
haward
took
snuff
with
jaquelin
then
mounting
his
horse
it
was
supposed
that
he
too
had
business
in
williamsburgh
raised
his
hat
and
bade
farewell
to
the
company
with
one
low
and
comprehensive
bow
the
equipage
made
a
wide
turn
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
upon
the
jaquelin
porch
fluttered
fans
and
handkerchiefs
the
colonel
leaning
from
the
coach
window
waved
his
hand
and
the
horseman
lifted
his
hat
the
second
time
the
very
especial
guests
were
gone
and
though
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
was
as
merry
as
heart
could
wish
yet
a
bouquet
a
flavor
a
tang
of
the
court
and
the
great
world
a
breath
of
air
that
was
not
colonial
had
gone
with
them
for
a
moment
the
women
stood
in
a
brown
study
revolving
in
their
minds
mistress
evelyn
gypsy
hat
and
the
exceeding
thinness
and
fineness
of
her
tucker
while
to
each
of
the
younger
men
came
linked
to
the
memory
of
a
charming
face
a
vision
of
westover
but
the
trumpet
blew
summoning
them
to
the
sport
of
the
afternoon
and
work
stopped
upon
castles
in
spain
when
a
was
on
a
meadow
in
virginia
sufficed
chapter
iv
the
road
to
williamsburgh
april
had
gone
out
in
rain
and
though
the
sun
now
shone
brightly
from
a
cloudless
sky
the
streams
were
swollen
and
the
road
was
heavy
the
ponderous
coach
and
the
four
black
horses
made
slow
progress
the
creeping
pace
the
languid
warmth
of
the
afternoon
the
scent
of
flowering
trees
the
ceaseless
singing
of
redbird
catbird
robin
and
thrush
made
it
drowsy
in
the
forest
in
the
midst
of
an
agreeable
dissertation
upon
may
day
sports
of
more
ancient
times
the
colonel
paused
to
smother
a
yawn
and
when
he
had
done
with
the
clown
the
piper
and
the
he
yawned
again
this
time
outright
what
with
ludwell
burgundy
piquet
and
the
french
peace
we
sat
late
last
night
my
eyes
are
as
heavy
as
the
road
have
you
noticed
my
dear
how
bland
and
dreamy
is
the
air
on
such
an
afternoon
one
is
content
to
be
in
virginia
and
out
of
the
world
it
is
a
very
land
of
the
lotophagi
a
lazy
clime
that
ulysses
touched
at
my
love
the
equipage
slowly
climbed
an
easy
ascent
and
as
slowly
descended
to
the
level
again
the
road
was
narrow
and
now
and
then
a
wild
struck
the
coach
with
a
white
arm
or
a
grapevine
swung
through
the
window
a
fragrant
trailer
the
woods
on
either
hand
were
pale
green
and
silver
gray
save
where
they
were
starred
with
dogwood
or
where
rose
the
pink
mist
of
the
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
road
skirted
a
mantled
pond
choked
with
broad
green
leaves
and
the
trunks
of
fallen
trees
upon
these
logs
basking
in
the
sunlight
lay
small
tortoises
by
the
score
a
snake
glided
across
the
road
in
front
of
the
horses
and
from
a
bit
of
muddy
ground
rose
a
cloud
of
yellow
butterflies
the
colonel
yawned
for
the
third
time
looked
at
his
watch
sighed
lifted
his
finely
arched
brows
with
a
whimsical
smile
for
his
own
somnolence
then
with
an
i
beg
your
pardon
my
love
took
out
a
lace
handkerchief
spread
it
over
his
face
and
head
and
crossing
his
legs
sunk
back
into
the
capacious
corner
of
the
coach
in
three
minutes
the
placid
rise
and
fall
of
his
ruffles
bore
witness
that
he
slept
the
horseman
who
riding
beside
the
lowered
glass
had
at
intervals
conversed
with
the
occupants
of
the
coach
now
glanced
from
the
sleeping
gentleman
to
the
lady
in
whose
dark
eyes
lurked
no
sign
of
drowsiness
the
pond
had
been
passed
and
before
them
between
low
banks
crowned
with
ferns
and
overshadowed
by
lay
a
long
stretch
of
shady
road
haward
drew
rein
dismounted
and
motioned
to
the
coachman
to
check
the
horses
when
the
coach
had
come
to
a
standstill
he
opened
the
door
with
as
little
creaking
as
might
be
and
held
out
a
petitionary
hand
will
you
not
walk
with
me
a
little
way
evelyn
he
asked
speaking
in
a
low
voice
that
he
might
not
wake
the
sleeper
it
is
much
pleasanter
out
here
with
the
birds
and
the
flowers
his
eyes
and
the
smile
upon
his
lips
added
and
with
me
from
what
he
had
been
upon
a
hilltop
one
moonlight
night
eleven
years
before
he
had
become
a
somewhat
silent
handsome
gentleman
composed
in
manner
experienced
not
unkindly
looking
abroad
from
his
apportioned
mountain
crag
and
solitary
fortress
upon
men
and
the
busy
ways
of
men
with
a
tolerant
gaze
that
to
certain
of
his
london
acquaintance
he
was
simply
the
philosopher
and
man
of
letters
that
in
the
minds
of
others
he
was
associated
with
the
peacock
plumage
of
the
world
of
fashion
with
the
flare
of
candles
the
hot
breath
of
gamesters
the
ring
of
gold
upon
the
tables
that
one
clique
had
tales
to
tell
of
a
magnanimous
spirit
and
a
generous
hand
while
yet
another
grew
red
at
mention
of
his
name
and
put
to
his
credit
much
that
was
not
creditable
was
perhaps
not
strange
he
like
his
neighbors
had
many
selves
and
each
in
its
turn
the
scholar
the
man
of
pleasure
the
indolent
kindly
reflective
self
the
self
of
pride
and
cool
assurance
and
stubborn
will
took
its
place
behind
the
mask
and
went
through
its
allotted
part
his
self
of
all
selves
the
quiet
remote
crowned
and
inscrutable
sat
apart
alike
curious
and
indifferent
watched
the
others
and
knew
how
little
worth
the
while
was
the
stir
in
the
but
on
a
may
day
in
the
sunshine
and
the
blossoming
woods
and
the
company
of
mistress
evelyn
byrd
it
seemed
for
the
moment
worth
the
while
at
his
invitation
she
had
taken
his
hand
and
descended
from
the
coach
the
great
painted
thing
moved
slowly
forward
bearing
the
unconscious
colonel
and
the
two
pedestrians
walked
behind
it
he
with
his
reins
over
his
arm
and
his
hat
in
his
hand
she
lifting
her
silken
skirts
from
contact
with
the
ground
and
looking
not
at
her
companion
but
at
the
greening
boughs
and
at
the
sunlight
striking
upon
smooth
pale
beech
trunks
and
the
earth
beneath
out
of
the
woods
came
a
sudden
medley
of
bird
notes
clear
sweet
and
inexpressibly
joyous
that
is
a
mockingbird
said
haward
i
once
heard
one
of
a
moonlight
night
beside
a
still
water
he
broke
off
and
they
listened
in
silence
the
bird
flew
away
and
they
came
to
a
brook
traversing
the
road
and
flowing
in
wide
meanders
through
the
forest
there
were
and
haward
crossing
first
turned
and
held
out
his
hand
to
the
lady
when
she
was
upon
his
side
of
the
streamlet
and
before
he
released
the
slender
fingers
he
bent
and
kissed
them
then
as
there
was
no
answering
smile
or
blush
but
only
a
quiet
withdrawal
of
the
hand
and
a
remark
about
the
crystal
clearness
of
the
brook
looked
at
her
with
interrogation
in
his
smile
what
is
that
crested
bird
upon
yonder
bough
she
asked
the
one
that
gave
the
piercing
cry
a
kingfisher
he
answered
and
cousin
to
the
halcyon
of
the
ancients
if
when
next
you
go
to
sea
you
take
its
feathers
with
you
you
need
have
no
fear
of
storms
a
tree
leafless
but
purplish
pink
with
bloom
leaned
from
the
bank
above
them
he
broke
a
branch
and
gave
it
to
her
it
is
the
he
told
her
iscariot
hanged
himself
thereon
around
the
trunk
of
a
beech
a
lizard
ran
like
a
green
flame
and
they
heard
the
distant
barking
of
a
fox
large
white
butterflies
went
past
them
and
a
hummingbird
whirred
into
the
heart
of
a
wild
honeysuckle
that
had
hasted
to
bloom
how
different
from
the
english
forests
she
said
i
could
love
these
best
what
are
all
those
plants
with
the
white
waxen
flowers
some
call
them
mandrakes
but
they
do
not
rise
shrieking
nor
kill
the
wight
that
plucks
them
will
you
have
me
gather
them
for
you
i
will
not
trouble
you
she
answered
and
presently
turned
aside
to
pull
them
for
herself
he
looked
at
the
graceful
bending
figure
and
lifted
his
brows
then
quickening
his
pace
until
he
was
up
with
the
coach
he
spoke
to
the
negro
upon
the
box
tyre
drive
on
to
that
big
pine
and
wait
there
for
your
mistress
and
me
sidon
to
the
footman
get
down
and
take
my
horse
if
your
master
wakes
tell
him
that
mistress
evelyn
tired
of
the
coach
and
that
i
am
picking
her
a
nosegay
tyre
and
sidon
haward
steed
the
four
black
coach
horses
the
coach
and
the
slumbering
colonel
all
made
a
progress
of
an
hundred
yards
to
the
where
the
cortége
came
to
a
halt
mistress
evelyn
looked
up
from
the
to
find
the
road
bare
before
her
and
haward
sitting
upon
a
log
watching
her
with
something
between
a
smile
and
a
frown
you
think
that
i
also
weigh
true
love
by
the
weight
of
the
purse
he
said
i
do
not
care
overmuch
for
your
gold
evelyn
she
did
not
answer
at
once
but
stood
with
her
head
slightly
bent
fingering
the
waxen
flowers
with
a
delicate
lingering
touch
now
that
there
was
no
longer
the
noise
of
the
wheels
and
the
horses
hoofs
the
forest
stillness
which
is
composed
of
sound
made
itself
felt
the
call
of
birds
the
whir
of
insects
the
murmur
of
the
wind
in
the
treetops
low
grave
incessant
and
eternal
as
the
sound
of
the
sea
joined
themselves
to
the
slow
waves
of
fragrance
the
stretch
of
road
whereon
nothing
moved
the
sunlight
lying
on
the
earth
and
made
a
spacious
quiet
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
for
which
you
care
overmuch
she
said
at
last
not
for
gold
or
the
lack
of
it
not
for
friends
or
for
enemies
not
even
for
yourself
i
have
known
you
for
many
years
he
answered
i
have
watched
you
grow
from
a
child
into
a
gracious
and
beautiful
woman
do
you
not
think
that
i
care
for
you
evelyn
near
where
he
sat
so
many
violets
were
blooming
that
they
made
a
purple
carpet
for
the
ground
going
over
to
them
she
knelt
and
began
to
pluck
them
if
any
danger
threatened
me
she
began
in
her
clear
low
voice
i
believe
that
you
would
step
between
me
and
it
though
at
the
peril
of
your
life
i
believe
that
you
take
some
pleasure
in
what
you
are
pleased
to
style
my
beauty
some
pride
in
a
mind
that
you
have
largely
formed
if
i
died
early
it
would
grieve
you
for
a
little
while
i
call
you
my
friend
i
would
be
called
your
lover
he
said
she
laid
her
fan
upon
the
ground
heaped
it
with
violets
and
turned
again
to
her
reaping
how
might
that
be
she
asked
when
you
do
not
love
me
i
knew
that
you
would
marry
me
what
do
the
french
call
it
de
her
voice
was
even
and
her
head
was
bent
so
that
he
could
not
see
her
face
in
the
pause
that
followed
her
words
treetop
whispered
to
treetop
but
the
sunshine
lay
very
still
and
bright
upon
the
road
and
upon
the
flowers
by
the
wayside
there
are
worse
marriages
haward
said
at
last
rising
from
the
log
he
moved
to
the
side
of
the
kneeling
figure
let
the
violets
rest
evelyn
while
we
reason
together
you
are
too
since
they
offend
you
i
will
drop
the
idle
compliments
the
pretty
phrases
in
which
neither
of
us
believes
what
if
this
tinted
dream
of
love
does
not
exist
for
us
what
if
we
are
only
friends
dear
and
old
friends
he
stooped
and
taking
her
by
the
busy
hands
made
her
stand
up
beside
him
can
not
we
marry
and
still
be
friends
he
demanded
with
something
like
laughter
in
his
eyes
my
dear
i
would
strive
to
make
you
happy
and
happiness
is
as
often
found
in
that
temperate
land
where
we
would
dwell
as
in
love
flaming
climate
he
smiled
and
tried
to
find
her
eyes
downcast
and
hidden
in
the
shadow
of
her
hat
this
is
no
flowery
wooing
such
as
women
love
he
said
but
then
you
are
like
no
other
woman
always
the
truth
was
best
with
you
upon
her
wrenching
her
hands
from
his
and
suddenly
and
proudly
raising
her
head
he
was
amazed
to
find
her
white
to
the
lips
the
truth
she
said
slowly
always
the
truth
was
best
well
then
take
the
truth
and
afterwards
and
forever
and
ever
leave
me
alone
you
have
been
frank
why
should
not
i
who
you
say
am
like
no
other
woman
be
so
too
i
will
not
marry
you
because
because
the
crimson
flowed
over
her
face
and
neck
then
ebbed
leaving
her
whiter
than
before
she
put
her
hands
that
still
held
the
wild
flowers
to
her
breast
and
her
eyes
dark
with
pain
met
his
had
you
loved
me
she
said
proudly
and
quietly
i
had
been
happy
illustration
had
you
loved
me
i
had
been
happy
haward
stepped
backwards
until
there
lay
between
them
a
strip
of
sunny
earth
the
murmur
of
the
wind
went
on
and
the
birds
were
singing
and
yet
the
forest
seemed
more
quiet
than
death
i
could
not
guess
he
said
speaking
slowly
and
with
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
i
have
spoken
like
a
brute
i
beg
your
pardon
you
might
have
known
you
might
have
guessed
she
cried
with
passion
but
you
walk
an
even
way
you
choose
nor
high
nor
low
you
look
deep
into
your
mind
but
your
heart
you
keep
cool
and
vacant
oh
a
very
temperate
land
i
think
that
others
less
wise
than
you
may
also
be
less
blind
never
speak
to
me
of
this
day
let
it
die
as
these
blooms
are
dying
in
this
hot
sunshine
now
let
us
walk
to
the
coach
and
waken
my
father
i
have
gathered
flowers
enough
side
by
side
but
without
speaking
they
moved
from
shadow
to
sunlight
and
from
sunlight
to
shadow
down
the
road
to
the
great
the
white
and
purple
flowers
lay
in
her
hand
and
along
her
bended
arm
from
the
folds
of
her
dress
of
some
rich
and
silken
stuff
in
its
changing
colors
breathed
the
subtle
fragrance
of
the
perfume
then
most
in
fashion
over
the
thin
lawn
that
half
revealed
half
concealed
neck
and
bosom
was
drawn
a
long
and
glossy
curl
carefully
let
to
escape
from
the
waved
and
banded
hair
beneath
the
gypsy
hat
exquisite
from
head
to
foot
the
figure
had
no
place
in
the
unpruned
untrained
savage
and
primeval
beauty
of
those
woods
smooth
sward
with
jets
of
water
and
carven
nymphs
embowered
in
clipped
box
or
yew
should
have
been
its
setting
and
not
this
wild
and
tangled
growth
this
license
of
bird
and
beast
and
growing
things
and
yet
the
incongruous
riot
the
contrast
of
profuse
untended
beauty
enhanced
the
value
of
the
picture
gave
it
piquancy
and
a
completer
charm
when
they
were
within
a
few
feet
of
the
coach
and
horses
and
negroes
all
drowsing
in
the
sunny
road
haward
made
as
if
to
speak
but
she
stopped
him
with
her
lifted
hand
spare
me
she
begged
it
is
bad
enough
as
it
is
but
words
would
make
it
worse
if
ever
a
day
might
come
i
do
not
think
that
i
am
unlovely
i
even
rate
myself
so
highly
as
to
think
that
i
am
worthy
of
your
love
if
ever
the
day
shall
come
when
you
can
say
to
me
i
see
that
love
is
no
tinted
dream
now
i
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
indeed
then
upon
that
day
but
until
then
ask
not
of
me
what
you
asked
back
there
among
the
violets
i
too
am
proud
her
voice
broke
evelyn
he
cried
poor
child
poor
friend
she
turned
her
face
upon
him
do
she
said
and
her
lips
were
smiling
though
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
we
have
forgot
that
it
is
may
day
and
that
we
must
be
light
of
heart
look
how
white
is
that
break
me
a
bough
for
my
at
williamsburgh
he
brought
her
a
branch
of
the
starry
blossoms
did
you
notice
she
asked
that
the
girl
who
ran
audrey
wore
dogwood
in
her
hair
you
could
see
her
heart
beat
with
very
love
of
living
she
was
of
the
woods
like
a
dryad
had
the
prizes
been
of
my
choosing
she
should
have
had
a
gift
more
poetical
than
a
guinea
haward
opened
the
coach
door
and
stood
gravely
aside
while
she
entered
the
vehicle
and
took
her
seat
depositing
her
flowers
upon
the
cushions
beside
her
the
colonel
stirred
uncrossed
his
legs
yawned
pulled
the
handkerchief
from
his
face
and
opened
his
eyes
faith
he
exclaimed
straightening
himself
and
taking
up
his
radiant
humor
where
upon
he
had
let
it
drop
the
way
must
have
suddenly
become
smooth
as
a
road
in
venice
for
i
felt
no
jolting
this
half
hour
flowers
evelyn
and
haward
afoot
you
been
on
a
woodland
saunter
then
while
i
enacted
solomon
sluggard
the
worthy
eyes
began
to
twinkle
what
flowers
did
you
find
they
have
strange
blooms
here
and
yet
i
warrant
that
even
in
these
woods
one
might
come
across
london
pride
and
and
his
daughter
smiled
and
asked
him
some
idle
question
about
the
and
the
the
master
of
westover
was
a
treasure
house
of
sprightly
lore
within
ten
minutes
he
had
visited
palestine
paid
his
compliments
to
the
ancient
herbalists
and
landed
again
in
his
own
coach
to
find
in
his
late
audience
a
somewhat
daughter
and
a
friend
in
a
brown
study
the
coach
was
lumbering
on
toward
williamsburgh
and
haward
with
level
gaze
and
hand
closed
tightly
upon
his
horse
reins
rode
by
the
window
while
the
lady
sitting
in
her
corner
with
downcast
eyes
fingered
the
dogwood
blooms
that
were
not
paler
than
her
face
the
colonel
wits
were
keen
one
glance
a
lift
of
his
arched
brows
the
merest
ghost
of
a
smile
and
dragging
the
younger
man
with
him
he
plunged
into
politics
invective
against
a
refractory
house
of
burgesses
brought
them
a
quarter
of
a
mile
upon
their
way
the
necessity
for
an
act
to
encourage
adventurers
in
iron
works
carried
them
past
a
milldam
and
frauds
in
the
customs
enabled
them
to
reach
a
crossroads
ordinary
where
the
colonel
ordered
a
halt
and
called
for
a
tankard
of
ale
a
slipshod
cherry
brought
it
and
spoke
her
thanks
in
broad
scotch
for
the
shilling
which
the
gay
colonel
flung
tinkling
into
the
measure
that
versatile
and
considerate
gentleman
having
had
his
draught
cried
to
the
coachman
to
go
on
and
was
beginning
upon
the
question
of
the
militia
when
haward
who
had
dismounted
appeared
at
the
coach
door
i
do
not
think
that
i
will
go
on
to
williamsburgh
with
you
sir
he
said
some
troublesome
business
with
my
overseer
that
ought
not
to
wait
if
i
take
this
road
and
the
planter
pace
i
shall
reach
fair
view
by
sunset
you
do
not
return
to
westover
this
week
then
i
shall
see
you
at
williamsburgh
within
a
day
or
two
evelyn
her
hand
lay
upon
the
cushion
nearest
him
he
would
have
taken
it
in
his
own
as
for
years
he
had
done
when
he
bade
her
but
though
she
smiled
and
gave
him
in
her
usual
voice
she
drew
the
hand
away
the
colonel
eyebrows
went
up
another
fraction
of
an
inch
but
he
was
a
discreet
gentleman
who
had
bought
experience
skillfully
unobservant
his
parting
words
were
at
once
cordial
and
few
in
number
and
after
haward
had
mounted
and
had
turned
into
the
side
road
he
put
his
handsome
periwigged
head
out
of
the
coach
window
and
called
to
him
some
advice
about
the
transplanting
of
tobacco
this
done
and
the
horseman
out
of
sight
and
the
coach
once
more
upon
its
leisurely
way
to
williamsburgh
the
model
father
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
a
small
book
and
after
affectionately
advising
his
daughter
to
close
her
eyes
and
sleep
out
the
miles
to
williamsburgh
himself
retired
with
horace
to
the
sabine
farm
chapter
v
the
storekeeper
it
was
now
late
afternoon
the
sun
rays
coming
slantingly
into
the
forest
and
the
warmth
of
the
day
past
and
gone
to
haward
riding
at
a
gallop
down
the
road
that
was
scarce
more
than
a
bridle
path
the
rush
of
the
cool
air
was
grateful
the
sharp
striking
of
protruding
twigs
the
violent
brushing
aside
of
hanging
vines
not
unwelcome
it
was
of
the
man
that
the
uppermost
feeling
in
his
mind
was
one
of
disgust
at
his
late
infelicity
of
speech
and
at
the
blindness
which
had
prompted
it
that
he
had
not
divined
that
he
had
been
so
dull
as
to
assume
that
as
he
felt
or
did
not
feel
so
must
she
annoyed
him
like
the
jar
of
rude
noises
or
like
sand
blowing
into
face
and
eyes
it
was
of
him
too
that
the
annoyance
was
purely
with
himself
for
her
when
at
last
he
came
to
think
of
her
he
found
only
the
old
placid
affection
as
far
removed
from
love
as
from
hate
if
he
knew
himself
it
would
always
be
as
far
removed
from
love
as
from
hate
all
the
days
of
her
youth
he
had
come
and
gone
a
welcome
guest
at
her
father
house
in
london
he
had
grown
to
be
her
friend
watching
the
crescent
beauty
of
face
and
mind
with
something
of
the
pride
and
tenderness
which
a
man
might
feel
for
a
young
and
favorite
sister
and
then
at
last
when
some
turn
of
affairs
sent
them
all
home
to
virginia
to
take
lot
and
part
there
he
had
thought
of
marriage
his
mind
had
turned
not
unwillingly
from
the
town
and
its
apples
of
sodom
to
his
virginia
plantation
that
he
had
not
seen
for
more
than
ten
years
it
was
his
birthplace
and
there
he
had
spent
his
boyhood
sometimes
in
heated
rooms
when
the
candles
in
the
sconces
were
guttering
down
and
the
dawn
looked
palely
in
upon
gaming
tables
and
heaped
gold
and
seamed
faces
haggardly
triumphant
haggardly
despairing
determinedly
indifferent
there
had
come
to
him
visions
of
cool
dawns
upon
the
river
wide
misty
expanses
of
marsh
and
forest
indistinct
and
cold
and
pure
the
lonely
great
house
too
the
house
which
his
father
had
built
with
so
much
love
and
pains
that
his
son
and
his
son
sons
should
have
a
worthy
home
appealed
to
him
and
the
garden
and
the
and
the
old
slaves
in
the
quarters
he
told
himself
that
he
was
glad
to
go
back
had
men
called
him
ambitious
he
would
have
smiled
and
felt
truly
that
they
had
bungled
in
the
word
such
and
such
things
were
simply
his
appurtenances
in
london
the
regard
due
to
a
gentleman
who
to
a
certain
distinction
in
his
manner
of
amusing
himself
added
the
achievement
of
a
successful
comedy
three
lampoons
quoted
at
all
london
and
a
piece
of
whig
invective
so
able
stern
and
sustained
that
many
cried
that
the
dean
had
met
his
match
in
virginia
the
deferential
esteem
of
the
colony
at
large
a
place
in
the
council
and
a
great
estate
an
alliance
with
the
master
of
westover
was
in
itself
a
desirable
thing
advantageous
to
purse
and
to
credit
his
house
must
have
a
mistress
and
that
mistress
must
please
at
every
point
his
fastidious
taste
what
better
to
do
than
to
give
it
for
mistress
evelyn
byrd
evelyn
who
had
had
for
all
her
suitors
only
a
slow
smile
and
shake
of
the
head
evelyn
who
was
older
than
her
years
evelyn
who
was
his
friend
as
he
was
hers
love
he
had
left
that
land
behind
and
she
had
never
touched
its
shores
the
geography
of
the
poets
to
the
contrary
it
did
not
lie
in
the
course
of
all
who
passed
through
life
he
made
his
suit
and
now
he
had
his
answer
if
he
did
not
take
trouble
to
wonder
at
her
confession
or
to
modestly
ask
himself
how
he
had
deserved
her
love
neither
did
he
insult
her
with
pity
or
with
any
lightness
of
thought
nor
was
he
ready
to
believe
that
his
rejection
was
final
apparently
indifferent
as
he
was
it
was
yet
his
way
to
move
steadily
and
relentlessly
if
very
quietly
toward
what
goal
he
desired
to
reach
he
thought
that
fair
view
might
yet
call
evelyn
byrd
its
mistress
since
turning
into
the
crossroad
that
running
south
and
east
would
take
him
back
to
the
banks
of
the
james
and
to
his
own
house
he
had
not
slackened
speed
but
now
as
he
saw
through
the
trees
before
him
a
long
zigzag
of
rail
fence
he
drew
rein
the
road
turned
and
a
gate
barred
his
way
when
he
had
opened
it
and
passed
through
he
was
upon
his
own
land
he
had
ridden
off
his
irritation
and
could
now
calmly
tell
himself
that
the
blunder
was
made
and
over
with
and
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
philosopher
to
remember
it
only
in
so
far
as
it
must
shape
his
future
course
his
house
of
cards
had
toppled
over
but
the
profound
indifferentism
of
his
nature
enabled
him
to
view
the
ruins
with
composure
after
a
while
he
would
build
the
house
again
the
image
of
evelyn
as
she
had
stood
and
pale
with
the
flowers
pressed
to
her
bosom
he
put
from
him
he
knew
her
strength
of
soul
and
with
the
curious
hardness
of
the
strong
toward
the
strong
and
also
not
without
the
delicacy
which
upon
occasion
he
could
both
feel
and
exhibit
he
shut
the
door
upon
that
hour
in
the
forest
he
had
left
the
woods
and
was
now
riding
through
a
field
of
newly
planted
tobacco
it
and
the
tobacco
house
in
the
midst
of
it
were
silent
deserted
bathed
in
the
late
sunshine
the
ground
rose
slightly
and
when
he
had
mounted
with
it
he
saw
below
him
the
huddle
of
cabins
which
formed
the
ridge
quarter
and
winding
down
to
it
a
string
of
negroes
one
turned
his
head
and
saw
the
solitary
horseman
upon
the
summit
of
the
slope
behind
him
another
looked
and
another
until
each
man
in
line
had
his
head
over
his
shoulder
they
knew
that
the
horseman
was
their
master
some
had
been
upon
the
plantation
when
he
was
a
boy
others
were
more
recent
acquisitions
who
knew
not
his
face
but
alike
they
grinned
and
ducked
the
white
man
walking
beside
the
line
took
off
his
hat
and
pulled
a
forelock
haward
raised
his
hand
that
they
might
know
he
saw
and
rode
on
another
piece
of
woods
where
a
great
number
of
felled
trees
cumbered
the
ground
more
tobacco
and
then
in
worn
fields
where
the
tobacco
had
been
wheat
rippling
in
the
evening
breeze
the
wheat
ran
down
to
a
marsh
and
to
a
wide
slow
creek
that
save
in
the
shadow
of
its
reedy
banks
was
blue
as
the
sky
above
haward
riding
slowly
beside
his
green
fields
and
still
waters
noted
with
quiet
pleasure
this
or
that
remembered
feature
of
the
landscape
there
had
been
little
change
here
where
he
remembered
deep
woods
tobacco
was
planted
there
where
the
tobacco
had
been
were
now
fields
of
wheat
or
corn
or
wild
tangles
of
saplings
and
brushwood
but
for
this
it
might
have
been
yesterday
that
he
had
last
ridden
that
way
presently
he
saw
the
river
and
then
the
marshes
with
brown
dots
that
were
his
cattle
straying
over
them
and
beyond
these
the
home
landing
and
the
masts
of
the
golden
rose
the
sun
was
near
its
setting
the
men
had
left
the
fields
over
all
things
were
the
stillness
and
peace
the
encroaching
shadows
the
dwindling
light
so
golden
in
its
quality
of
late
afternoon
when
he
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
creek
the
hollow
sound
that
the
boards
gave
forth
beneath
his
horse
hoofs
had
the
depth
and
resonance
of
drumbeats
and
the
cry
of
a
solitary
heron
in
the
marsh
seemed
louder
than
its
wont
he
passed
the
and
drew
near
to
the
river
riding
again
through
tobacco
these
plants
were
oronoko
the
mild
took
the
higher
ground
along
the
river
bank
grew
a
row
of
tall
and
stately
trees
passing
beneath
them
he
saw
the
shining
water
between
brown
columns
or
through
a
veil
of
slight
unfolding
leaves
soon
the
trees
fell
away
and
he
came
to
a
stretch
of
bank
here
naked
earth
there
clad
in
grass
and
dewberry
vines
near
by
was
a
small
landing
with
several
boats
fastened
to
its
piles
and
at
a
little
distance
beyond
it
shadowed
by
a
a
strongly
built
wooden
house
with
the
earth
around
it
trodden
hard
and
bare
and
with
two
or
three
benches
before
its
open
door
haward
recognized
the
store
which
his
father
after
the
manner
of
his
kind
merchant
and
trader
as
well
as
planter
and
maker
of
laws
had
built
and
which
through
his
agent
in
virginia
he
had
maintained
before
one
of
the
benches
a
man
was
kneeling
with
his
back
to
haward
who
could
only
see
that
his
garb
was
that
of
a
servant
and
that
his
hands
were
busily
moving
certain
small
objects
this
way
and
that
upon
the
board
at
the
edge
of
the
space
of
bare
earth
were
a
and
a
haward
rode
up
to
them
dismounted
and
fastened
his
horse
then
walked
over
to
the
man
at
the
bench
so
intent
was
the
latter
upon
his
employment
that
he
heard
neither
horse
nor
rider
he
had
some
shells
a
few
bits
of
turf
and
a
double
handful
of
sand
and
he
was
arranging
these
trifles
upon
the
rough
unpainted
boards
in
a
curious
and
intricate
pattern
he
was
a
tall
man
with
hair
that
was
more
red
than
brown
and
he
was
dressed
in
a
shirt
of
dowlas
leather
breeches
and
coarse
shoes
and
stockings
what
are
you
doing
asked
haward
after
a
moment
silent
watching
of
the
busy
fingers
and
intent
countenance
there
was
no
start
of
awakened
consciousness
upon
the
other
part
why
he
said
as
if
he
had
asked
the
question
of
himself
with
this
sand
i
have
traced
the
shores
of
this
turf
is
green
ulva
and
this
is
gometra
and
the
shell
is
little
colonsay
with
this
wet
sand
i
have
moulded
ben
grieg
and
this
higher
pile
is
ben
more
if
i
had
but
a
sprig
of
heather
now
or
a
pebble
from
the
shore
of
scridain
the
voice
while
harsh
was
not
disagreeably
so
and
neither
the
words
nor
the
manner
of
using
them
smacked
of
the
rustic
and
where
are
and
ulva
and
scridain
demanded
haward
somewhere
in
north
britain
i
presume
the
second
question
broke
the
spell
the
man
glanced
over
his
shoulder
saw
that
he
was
not
alone
and
with
one
sweep
of
his
hand
blotting
loch
and
island
and
mountain
out
of
existence
rose
to
his
feet
and
opposed
to
haward
gaze
a
tall
muscular
frame
high
features
slightly
pockmarked
and
keen
dark
blue
eyes
i
was
dreaming
and
did
not
hear
you
he
said
civilly
enough
it
not
often
that
any
one
comes
to
the
store
at
this
time
of
day
what
d
ye
lack
as
he
spoke
he
moved
toward
the
doorway
through
which
showed
shelves
and
tables
piled
with
the
extraordinary
variety
of
goods
which
were
deemed
essential
to
the
colonial
trade
are
you
the
storekeeper
asked
haward
keeping
pace
with
the
other
long
stride
it
the
name
they
call
me
by
answered
the
man
curtly
then
as
he
chanced
to
turn
his
eyes
upon
the
landing
his
tone
changed
and
a
smile
irradiated
his
countenance
here
comes
a
customer
he
remarked
make
you
bide
your
turn
a
boat
rowed
by
a
young
boy
and
carrying
a
woman
had
slipped
out
of
the
creek
and
along
the
river
bank
to
the
steps
of
the
landing
when
they
were
reached
the
boy
sat
still
the
oars
resting
across
his
knees
and
his
face
upturned
to
a
palace
beautiful
of
pearl
and
saffron
cloud
but
the
woman
mounted
the
steps
and
crossing
the
boards
came
up
to
the
door
and
the
men
beside
it
her
dress
was
gray
and
unadorned
and
she
was
young
and
of
a
quiet
loveliness
mistress
truelove
taberer
said
the
storekeeper
what
can
you
choose
this
may
day
that
so
fair
as
yourself
a
pair
of
gray
eyes
were
lifted
for
the
sixth
part
of
a
second
and
a
voice
that
bad
learned
of
the
doves
in
the
forest
proceeded
to
rebuke
the
flatterer
thee
is
idle
in
thy
speech
angus
maclean
it
declared
i
am
not
fair
nor
if
i
were
should
thee
tell
me
of
it
also
friend
it
is
idle
and
tendeth
toward
idolatry
to
speak
of
the
first
day
of
the
fifth
month
as
may
day
my
mother
sent
me
for
a
paper
of
needles
and
two
of
manikin
pins
has
thee
them
in
thy
store
of
goods
come
you
in
and
look
for
yourself
said
the
storekeeper
woman
gear
enough
but
it
were
easier
for
me
to
recount
the
names
of
all
the
children
of
than
to
remember
how
you
call
the
things
you
wear
so
saying
he
entered
the
store
the
quakeress
followed
and
haward
tired
of
his
own
thoughts
and
in
the
mood
to
be
amused
by
trifles
trod
in
their
footsteps
door
and
window
faced
the
west
and
the
glow
from
the
sinking
sun
illumined
the
thousand
and
one
features
of
the
place
here
was
the
glint
of
tools
and
weapons
there
pewter
shone
like
silver
and
brass
dazzled
the
eyes
bales
of
red
cotton
blue
linen
flowered
kidderminster
scarlet
serge
gold
and
silver
drugget
all
sorts
of
woven
stuffs
from
lockram
to
brocade
made
bright
the
shelves
pendent
skins
of
buck
and
doe
showed
like
brown
satin
while
upon
the
wall
reflected
green
trees
and
painted
clouds
in
one
dark
corner
lurked
kegs
of
powder
and
of
shot
another
was
the
haunt
of
aqua
vitæ
and
right
jamaica
snuffboxes
and
fringed
gloves
elbowed
a
shelf
of
books
and
a
wig
ogled
a
lady
headdress
of
ribbon
and
malines
knives
and
hatchets
and
duffel
blankets
for
the
indian
trade
were
not
wanting
haward
leaning
against
a
table
laden
with
so
singular
a
miscellany
that
a
fine
saddle
with
crimson
velvet
holsters
took
the
head
of
the
board
while
the
foot
was
set
with
blue
and
white
china
watched
the
sometime
moulder
of
peak
and
islet
draw
out
a
case
filled
with
such
small
and
womanish
articles
as
pins
and
needles
tape
and
thread
and
place
it
before
his
customer
she
made
her
choice
and
the
storekeeper
brought
a
great
book
and
entered
against
the
head
of
the
house
of
taberer
so
many
pounds
of
tobacco
then
as
the
maiden
turned
to
depart
heaved
a
sigh
so
piteous
and
profound
that
no
tender
saint
in
gray
could
do
less
than
pause
half
turn
her
head
and
lift
two
compassionate
eyes
mistress
truelove
i
have
read
the
good
book
that
you
gave
me
and
i
can
not
deny
that
i
am
much
beholden
to
you
and
her
debtor
sighed
like
a
furnace
the
girl
quiet
face
flushed
to
the
pink
of
a
seashell
and
her
eyes
grew
eager
then
does
thee
not
see
the
error
of
thy
ways
angus
maclean
if
it
should
be
given
me
to
pluck
thee
as
a
brand
from
the
burning
thee
will
not
again
brag
of
war
and
revenge
nor
sing
vain
and
ruthless
songs
nor
use
dice
or
cards
nor
will
thee
swear
any
more
the
voice
was
persuasion
own
may
i
be
set
overtide
on
the
lady
rock
or
spare
a
false
campbell
when
i
meet
him
or
throw
up
my
cap
for
the
damned
hogan
mogan
that
sits
in
jamie
place
if
i
am
not
entirely
convert
cried
the
neophyte
oh
the
devil
what
have
i
said
mistress
truelove
truelove
but
truelove
was
gone
not
in
anger
or
in
haste
for
that
would
have
been
unseemly
but
quietly
and
steadily
with
no
looking
back
the
storekeeper
leaping
over
a
keg
of
nails
that
stood
in
the
way
made
for
the
door
and
together
with
haward
who
was
already
there
watched
her
go
the
path
to
the
landing
and
the
boat
was
short
she
had
taken
her
seat
and
the
boy
had
bent
to
the
oars
while
the
unlucky
scot
was
yet
alternately
calling
out
protestations
of
amendment
and
muttering
maledictions
upon
his
unguarded
tongue
the
canoe
slipped
from
the
rosy
unshadowed
water
into
the
darkness
beneath
the
overhanging
trees
reached
the
mouth
of
the
creek
and
in
a
moment
disappeared
from
sight
chapter
vi
master
and
man
the
two
men
left
alone
turned
each
toward
the
interior
of
the
store
and
their
eyes
met
alike
in
gray
eyes
and
in
dark
blue
there
was
laughter
kittle
folk
the
quakers
said
the
storekeeper
with
a
shrug
and
went
to
put
away
his
case
of
pins
and
needles
haward
going
to
the
end
of
the
store
found
a
row
of
dusty
bottles
and
breaking
the
neck
of
one
with
a
report
like
that
of
a
pistol
set
the
madeira
to
his
lips
and
therewith
quenched
his
thirst
the
wine
cellar
abutted
upon
the
library
taking
off
his
riding
glove
he
ran
his
finger
along
the
bindings
and
plucking
forth
the
history
of
a
coy
lady
looked
at
the
first
page
read
the
last
paragraph
and
finally
thrust
the
thin
brown
and
gilt
volume
into
his
pocket
turning
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
storekeeper
i
have
not
the
honor
of
knowing
your
name
sir
remarked
the
latter
dryly
do
you
buy
at
this
store
and
upon
whose
account
haward
shook
his
head
and
applied
himself
again
to
the
madeira
then
you
carry
with
you
coin
of
the
realm
with
which
to
settle
continued
the
other
the
wine
is
two
shillings
the
book
you
may
have
for
here
i
need
not
pay
good
fellow
said
haward
negligently
his
eyes
upon
a
row
of
dangling
objects
fetch
me
down
yonder
cane
is
as
delicately
tapered
and
clouded
as
any
at
the
exchange
pay
me
first
for
the
wine
and
the
book
answered
the
man
composedly
it
a
dirty
business
enough
god
knows
for
a
gentleman
to
put
finger
to
but
since
needs
must
when
the
devil
drives
and
he
has
driven
me
here
why
i
angus
maclean
who
have
no
concerns
of
my
own
must
be
faithful
to
the
concerns
of
another
wherefore
put
down
the
silver
you
owe
the
sassenach
whose
wine
you
have
drunken
and
whose
book
you
have
taken
and
if
i
do
not
choose
to
pay
asked
haward
with
a
smile
then
you
must
choose
to
fight
was
the
cool
reply
and
as
i
observe
that
you
wear
neither
sword
nor
pistols
and
as
jack
boots
and
a
fine
riding
coat
are
not
the
easiest
clothes
to
wrestle
in
it
appears
just
possible
that
i
might
win
the
cause
and
when
you
thrown
me
what
then
oh
i
would
just
draw
a
rope
around
you
and
yonder
cask
of
jamaica
and
leave
you
to
read
your
stolen
book
in
peace
until
saunderson
that
the
overseer
and
he
none
so
bad
if
he
was
born
in
fife
shall
come
you
can
have
it
out
with
him
or
maybe
he
hale
you
before
the
man
that
owns
the
store
i
hear
they
expect
him
home
haward
laughed
and
abstracting
another
bottle
from
the
shelf
broke
its
neck
hand
me
yonder
cup
he
said
easily
and
we
drink
to
his
good
fellow
i
am
marmaduke
haward
and
i
am
glad
to
find
so
honest
a
man
in
a
place
of
no
small
trust
long
absence
and
somewhat
too
complaisant
a
reference
of
all
my
virginian
affairs
to
my
agent
have
kept
me
much
in
ignorance
of
the
economy
of
my
plantation
how
long
have
you
been
my
storekeeper
neither
cup
for
the
wine
nor
answer
to
the
question
being
forthcoming
haward
looked
up
from
his
broken
bottle
the
man
was
standing
with
his
body
bent
forward
and
his
hand
pressed
against
the
wood
of
a
great
cask
behind
him
until
the
showed
white
his
head
was
high
his
face
dark
red
and
angry
his
brows
drawn
down
until
the
gleaming
eyes
beneath
were
like
pin
points
so
sudden
and
so
sinister
was
the
change
that
haward
was
startled
the
hour
was
late
the
place
deserted
as
the
man
had
discovered
he
had
no
weapons
nor
strong
active
and
practiced
as
he
was
did
he
flatter
himself
that
he
could
withstand
the
length
of
brawn
and
sinew
before
him
involuntarily
he
stepped
backward
until
there
was
a
space
between
them
casting
at
the
same
moment
a
glance
toward
the
wall
where
hung
axe
and
knife
and
hatchet
the
man
intercepted
the
look
and
broke
into
a
laugh
the
sound
was
harsh
and
gibing
but
not
menacing
you
need
not
be
afraid
he
said
i
do
not
want
the
feel
of
a
rope
around
my
neck
though
god
knows
why
i
should
care
here
is
no
clansman
of
mine
and
no
cursed
campbell
either
to
see
my
end
i
am
not
afraid
haward
answered
calmly
walking
to
the
shelf
that
held
an
array
of
drinking
vessels
he
took
two
cups
filled
them
with
wine
and
going
back
to
his
former
station
set
one
upon
the
cask
beside
the
storekeeper
the
wine
is
good
he
said
will
you
drink
the
other
loosened
the
clasp
of
his
hand
upon
the
wood
and
drew
himself
upright
i
eat
the
bread
and
drink
the
water
which
you
give
your
servants
he
answered
speaking
with
the
thickness
of
hardly
restrained
passion
the
wine
cup
goes
from
equal
to
equal
as
he
spoke
he
took
up
the
peace
offering
eyed
it
for
a
moment
with
a
bitter
smile
then
flung
it
with
force
over
his
shoulder
the
earthen
floor
drank
the
wine
the
china
shivered
into
a
thousand
fragments
i
have
neither
silver
nor
tobacco
with
which
to
pay
for
my
pleasure
continued
the
still
smiling
storekeeper
when
i
am
come
to
the
end
of
my
term
then
an
it
please
you
i
will
serve
out
the
damage
haward
sat
down
upon
a
keg
of
powder
crossed
his
knees
and
with
his
chin
upon
his
hand
looked
from
between
the
curled
lengths
of
his
periwig
at
the
figure
opposite
i
am
glad
to
find
that
in
virginia
at
least
there
is
honesty
he
said
dryly
i
will
try
to
remember
the
cost
of
the
cup
and
the
wine
against
the
expiry
of
your
indenture
in
the
mean
time
i
am
curious
to
know
why
you
are
angry
with
me
whom
you
have
never
seen
before
with
the
dashing
of
the
wine
to
earth
the
other
passion
had
apparently
spent
itself
the
red
slowly
left
his
face
and
he
leaned
at
ease
against
the
cask
drumming
upon
its
head
with
his
fingers
the
sunlight
shrinking
from
floor
and
wall
had
left
but
a
single
line
of
gold
in
the
half
light
strange
and
sombre
shapes
possessed
the
room
through
the
stillness
beneath
the
sound
of
the
tattoo
upon
the
cask
head
the
river
made
itself
heard
for
ten
years
and
more
you
have
been
my
master
said
the
storekeeper
it
is
a
word
for
which
i
have
an
invincible
distaste
it
is
not
well
having
neither
love
nor
friendship
to
put
in
its
place
to
let
hatred
die
when
i
came
first
to
this
slavery
i
hated
all
campbells
all
whigs
forster
that
betrayed
us
at
preston
and
ewin
mor
mackinnon
but
the
years
have
come
and
the
years
have
gone
and
i
am
older
than
i
was
at
the
campbells
i
can
never
reach
they
walk
secure
overseas
through
lorn
and
argyle
couching
in
the
tall
heather
above
etive
tracking
the
red
deer
in
the
forest
of
dalness
forster
is
dead
ewin
mackinnon
is
dead
i
know
for
five
years
ago
come
martinmas
night
i
saw
his
perjured
soul
on
its
way
to
hell
all
the
world
is
turning
whig
a
man
may
hate
the
world
it
is
true
but
he
needs
a
single
foe
and
in
that
capacity
you
have
adopted
me
demanded
haward
maclean
let
his
gaze
travel
over
the
man
opposite
him
from
the
looped
hat
and
the
face
between
the
waves
of
hair
to
the
gilt
spurs
upon
the
great
boots
then
turned
his
eyes
upon
his
own
hand
and
coarsely
clad
arm
stretched
across
the
cask
i
too
am
a
gentleman
the
brother
of
a
chieftain
he
declared
i
am
not
without
schooling
i
have
seen
something
of
life
and
of
countries
more
polite
than
the
land
where
i
was
born
though
not
so
dear
i
have
been
free
and
have
loved
my
freedom
do
you
find
it
so
strange
that
i
should
hate
you
there
was
a
silence
then
upon
my
soul
i
do
not
know
that
i
do
said
haward
slowly
and
yet
until
this
day
i
did
not
know
of
your
existence
but
i
knew
of
yours
answered
the
storekeeper
your
agent
hath
an
annoying
trick
of
speech
and
the
overseers
have
caught
it
from
him
master
this
and
master
that
in
short
for
ten
years
it
hath
been
you
dog
that
your
master
may
play
well
i
have
worked
it
was
that
or
killing
myself
or
going
mad
i
have
worked
for
you
in
the
fields
in
the
smithy
in
this
close
room
but
when
you
bought
my
body
you
could
not
buy
my
soul
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
i
sent
it
away
i
would
not
let
it
bide
in
these
dull
levels
in
this
cursed
land
of
heat
and
stagnant
waters
at
first
it
went
home
to
its
own
country
to
its
friends
and
its
foes
to
the
torrent
and
the
mountain
and
the
music
of
the
pipes
but
at
last
the
pain
outweighed
the
pleasure
and
i
sent
it
there
no
more
and
then
it
began
to
follow
you
to
follow
me
involuntarily
exclaimed
haward
i
have
been
in
london
went
on
the
other
without
heeding
the
interruption
i
know
the
life
of
men
of
quality
and
where
they
most
resort
i
early
learned
from
your
other
servants
and
from
the
chance
words
of
those
who
had
your
affairs
in
charge
that
you
were
young
a
man
of
pleasure
at
first
when
i
thought
of
you
the
blood
came
into
my
cheek
but
at
last
i
thought
of
you
constantly
and
i
felt
for
you
a
constant
hatred
it
began
when
i
knew
that
ewin
mackinnon
was
dead
i
had
no
need
of
love
i
had
need
of
hate
day
after
day
my
body
slaving
here
my
mind
has
dogged
your
footsteps
up
and
down
to
and
fro
in
business
and
in
pleasure
in
whatever
place
i
have
imagined
you
to
be
there
have
i
been
also
did
you
never
when
there
seemed
none
by
look
over
your
shoulder
feeling
another
presence
than
your
own
he
ceased
to
speak
and
the
hand
upon
the
cask
was
still
the
sunshine
was
clean
gone
from
the
room
and
without
the
door
the
wind
in
the
answered
the
voice
of
the
river
haward
rose
from
his
seat
but
made
no
further
motion
toward
departing
you
have
been
frank
he
said
quietly
had
you
it
in
mind
all
this
while
so
to
speak
to
me
when
we
should
meet
no
answered
the
other
i
thought
not
of
words
but
of
but
of
deeds
haward
finished
for
him
rather
i
imagine
of
one
deed
composed
as
ever
in
voice
and
manner
he
drew
out
his
watch
and
held
it
aslant
that
the
light
might
strike
upon
the
dial
is
after
six
he
remarked
as
he
put
it
away
and
i
am
yet
a
mile
from
the
house
the
wine
that
he
had
poured
for
himself
had
been
standing
untouched
upon
the
keg
beside
him
he
took
it
up
and
drank
it
off
then
wiped
his
lips
with
his
handkerchief
and
passing
the
storekeeper
with
a
slight
inclination
of
his
head
walked
toward
the
door
a
yard
beyond
the
man
who
had
so
coolly
shown
his
side
of
the
shield
was
a
rude
table
on
which
were
displayed
hatchets
and
hunting
knives
haward
passed
the
gleaming
steel
then
a
foot
beyond
it
stood
still
his
face
to
the
open
door
and
his
back
to
the
storekeeper
and
the
table
with
its
sinister
lading
you
do
wrong
to
allow
so
much
dust
and
disorder
he
said
sharply
i
could
write
my
name
in
that
mirror
and
there
is
a
piece
of
brocade
fallen
to
the
floor
look
to
it
that
you
keep
the
place
more
neat
there
was
dead
silence
for
a
moment
then
maclean
spoke
in
an
even
voice
now
a
fool
might
call
you
as
brave
as
hector
for
myself
i
only
give
you
credit
for
some
knowledge
of
men
you
are
right
it
is
not
my
way
to
strike
in
the
back
an
unarmed
man
when
you
are
gone
i
will
wipe
off
the
mirror
and
pick
up
the
brocade
he
followed
haward
outside
it
a
brave
evening
for
riding
he
remarked
and
you
have
a
bonny
bit
of
horseflesh
there
you
get
to
the
house
before
candlelight
beside
one
of
the
benches
haward
made
another
pause
you
are
a
highlander
and
a
jacobite
he
said
from
your
reference
to
forster
i
gather
that
you
were
among
the
prisoners
taken
at
preston
and
transported
to
virginia
in
the
elizabeth
and
anne
of
liverpool
a
bit
of
hell
afloat
the
master
captain
edward
trafford
satan
first
mate
quoth
the
other
grimly
he
stooped
to
the
bench
where
lay
the
débris
of
the
coast
and
mountains
he
had
been
lately
building
and
picked
up
a
small
deep
shell
my
story
is
short
he
began
it
could
be
packed
into
this
i
was
born
in
the
island
of
mull
of
my
father
a
chieftain
and
my
mother
a
lady
some
schooling
i
got
in
aberdeen
some
pleasure
in
edinburgh
and
london
and
some
service
abroad
in
my
year
being
at
home
at
that
time
i
was
asked
to
a
hunting
match
at
braemar
and
went
no
great
while
afterwards
i
was
bidden
to
supper
at
an
edinburgh
tavern
and
again
i
accepted
the
invitation
there
was
a
small
entertainment
to
follow
the
supper
just
the
taking
of
edinburgh
castle
but
the
wine
was
good
and
we
waited
to
powder
our
hair
and
the
entertainment
could
hardly
be
called
a
success
hard
upon
that
convivial
evening
i
with
many
others
was
asked
across
the
border
to
join
a
number
of
gentlemen
who
drank
to
the
king
after
our
fashion
and
had
a
like
fancy
for
oak
boughs
and
white
roses
the
weather
was
pleasant
the
company
of
the
best
the
roads
very
noble
after
our
highland
sheep
tracks
together
with
our
english
friends
and
enlivened
by
much
good
claret
and
by
music
of
bagpipe
and
drum
we
strolled
on
through
a
fine
populous
country
until
we
came
to
a
town
called
preston
where
we
thought
we
would
tarry
for
a
day
or
two
however
circumstances
arose
which
detained
us
somewhat
longer
i
dare
say
you
have
heard
the
story
when
finally
we
took
our
leave
some
of
us
went
to
heaven
some
to
hell
and
some
to
barbadoes
and
virginia
i
was
among
those
dispatched
to
virginia
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
i
died
the
day
i
landed
there
the
shell
is
full
he
tossed
it
from
him
and
going
to
the
loosed
horse
haward
took
the
reins
from
his
hand
it
hath
been
ten
years
and
more
since
virginia
got
her
share
of
the
rebels
taken
at
preston
if
i
remember
aright
their
indentures
were
to
be
made
for
seven
years
why
then
are
you
yet
in
my
service
maclean
laughed
i
ran
away
he
replied
pleasantly
and
when
i
was
caught
i
made
off
a
second
time
i
wonder
that
you
planters
do
not
have
a
society
for
the
encouragement
of
runaways
seeing
that
they
are
nearly
always
retaken
and
that
their
escapades
so
lengthen
their
term
of
service
it
would
surely
be
to
your
advantage
there
are
yet
several
years
in
which
i
am
to
call
you
master
he
laughed
again
but
the
sound
was
mirthless
and
the
eyes
beneath
the
lids
were
harder
than
steel
haward
mounted
his
horse
and
gathered
up
the
reins
i
am
not
responsible
for
the
laws
of
the
realm
he
said
calmly
nor
for
rebellions
and
insurrections
nor
for
the
practice
of
transporting
overseas
those
to
whom
have
been
given
the
ugly
names
of
and
destiny
that
set
you
there
put
me
here
we
are
alike
pawns
what
the
player
means
we
have
no
way
of
telling
curse
fate
and
the
gods
if
you
choose
and
find
that
your
cursing
does
small
good
but
regard
me
with
indifference
as
one
neither
more
nor
less
the
slave
of
circumstances
than
yourself
it
has
been
long
since
i
went
this
way
is
there
yet
the
path
by
the
river
ay
answered
the
other
it
is
your
shortest
road
then
i
will
be
going
said
haward
it
grows
late
and
i
am
not
looked
for
before
as
he
spoke
he
raised
his
hat
and
bowed
to
the
gentleman
from
whom
he
was
parting
that
rebel
to
king
george
gave
a
great
start
then
turned
very
red
and
shot
a
piercing
glance
at
the
man
on
horseback
the
latter
mien
was
composed
as
ever
and
with
his
hat
held
beneath
his
arm
and
his
body
slightly
inclined
he
was
evidently
awaiting
a
like
ceremony
of
on
the
storekeeper
part
maclean
drew
a
long
breath
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
and
bowed
to
his
equal
a
second
and
one
gentleman
rode
off
in
the
direction
of
the
great
house
while
the
other
went
thoughtfully
back
to
the
store
got
a
cloth
and
wiped
the
dust
from
the
mirror
it
was
pleasant
riding
by
the
river
in
the
cool
evening
wind
with
the
colors
of
the
sunset
yet
gay
in
sky
and
water
haward
went
slowly
glancing
now
at
the
great
bright
stream
now
at
the
wide
calm
fields
and
the
rim
of
woodland
dark
and
distant
bounding
his
possessions
the
smell
of
salt
marshes
of
ploughed
ground
of
leagues
of
flowering
forests
was
in
his
nostrils
behind
him
was
the
crescent
moon
before
him
a
terrace
crowned
with
lofty
trees
within
the
ring
of
foliage
was
the
house
even
as
he
looked
a
light
sprang
up
in
a
high
window
and
shone
like
a
star
through
the
gathering
dusk
below
the
hill
the
home
landing
ran
its
gaunt
black
length
far
out
into
the
carmine
of
the
river
upon
the
golden
rose
lights
burned
like
lower
stars
from
a
thicket
to
the
left
of
the
bridle
path
sounded
the
call
of
a
whippoorwill
a
gust
of
wind
blowing
from
the
bay
made
to
waver
the
lanterns
of
the
golden
rose
broke
and
darkened
the
coral
peace
of
the
river
and
pushed
rudely
against
the
master
of
those
parts
haward
laid
his
hand
upon
his
horse
that
he
loved
this
is
better
than
the
ring
is
it
mirza
he
asked
genially
and
the
horse
whinnied
under
his
touch
the
land
was
quite
gray
the
river
and
the
fireflies
beginning
to
sparkle
when
he
rode
through
the
home
gates
in
the
dusk
of
the
world
out
of
the
deeper
shadow
of
the
surrounding
trees
his
house
looked
grimly
upon
him
the
light
had
been
at
the
side
all
the
front
was
stark
and
black
with
shuttered
windows
he
rode
to
the
back
of
the
house
and
hallooed
to
the
slaves
in
the
home
quarter
where
were
lights
and
noisy
laughter
and
one
deep
voice
singing
in
an
unknown
tongue
it
was
but
a
stone
throw
to
the
nearest
cabin
and
haward
call
made
itself
heard
above
the
babel
the
noise
suddenly
lessened
and
two
or
three
negroes
starting
up
from
the
doorstep
hurried
across
the
grass
to
horse
and
rider
quickly
as
they
came
some
one
within
the
house
was
beforehand
with
them
the
door
swung
open
there
was
the
flare
of
a
lighted
candle
and
a
voice
cried
out
to
know
what
was
wanted
wanted
exclaimed
haward
ingress
into
my
own
house
is
wanted
where
is
juba
one
of
the
negroes
pressed
forward
heah
i
is
marse
duke
house
all
ready
for
you
but
you
done
sont
word
i
know
i
know
answered
haward
impatiently
i
changed
my
mind
is
that
you
saunderson
with
the
light
or
is
it
hide
the
candle
moved
to
one
side
and
there
was
disclosed
a
large
white
face
atop
of
a
shambling
figure
dressed
in
some
coarse
dark
stuff
neither
sir
said
an
expressionless
voice
will
it
please
your
honor
to
dismount
haward
swung
himself
out
of
the
saddle
tossed
the
reins
to
a
negro
and
with
juba
at
his
heels
climbed
the
five
low
stone
steps
and
entered
the
wide
hall
running
through
the
house
and
broken
only
by
the
broad
winding
stairway
save
for
the
glimmer
of
the
solitary
candle
all
was
in
darkness
the
bare
floor
the
paneled
walls
echoed
to
his
tread
on
either
hand
squares
of
blackness
proclaimed
the
open
doors
of
large
empty
rooms
and
down
the
stair
came
a
wind
that
bent
the
weak
flame
the
negro
took
the
light
from
the
hand
of
the
man
who
had
opened
the
door
and
pressing
past
his
master
lit
three
candles
in
a
sconce
upon
the
wall

haward
nodded
and
taking
the
candle
began
to
mount
the
stairs
half
way
up
he
found
that
the
man
in
the
raiment
was
following
him
he
raised
his
brows
but
being
in
a
taciturn
humor
and
having
moreover
to
shield
the
flame
from
the
wind
that
drove
down
the
stair
he
said
nothing
going
on
in
silence
to
the
landing
and
to
the
great
room
that
had
been
his
father
and
which
now
he
meant
to
make
his
own
there
were
candles
on
the
table
the
dresser
and
the
mantelshelf
he
lit
them
all
and
the
room
changed
from
a
place
of
shadows
and
monstrous
shapes
to
a
gentleman
bedchamber
somewhat
sparsely
furnished
but
of
a
comfortable
and
cheerful
aspect
a
cloth
lay
upon
the
floor
the
windows
were
curtained
and
the
bed
had
fresh
hangings
of
green
and
white
kidderminster
over
the
mantel
hung
a
painting
of
haward
and
his
mother
done
when
he
was
six
years
old
beneath
the
laughing
child
and
the
smiling
lady
young
and
were
crossed
two
ancient
swords
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
heavy
table
and
pushed
back
as
though
some
one
had
lately
risen
from
it
was
an
armchair
of
russian
leather
books
lay
upon
the
table
one
of
them
open
with
a
horn
snuffbox
keeping
down
the
leaf
haward
seated
himself
in
the
great
chair
and
looked
around
him
with
a
thoughtful
and
melancholy
smile
he
could
not
clearly
remember
his
mother
the
rings
upon
her
fingers
and
her
silvery
laughter
were
all
that
dwelt
in
his
mind
and
now
only
the
sound
of
that
merriment
floated
back
to
him
and
lingered
in
the
room
but
his
father
had
died
upon
that
bed
and
beside
the
dead
man
between
the
candles
at
the
head
and
the
candles
at
the
foot
he
had
sat
the
night
through
the
curtains
were
half
drawn
and
in
their
shadow
his
imagination
laid
again
that
cold
inanimate
form
twelve
years
ago
how
young
he
had
been
that
night
and
how
old
he
had
thought
himself
as
he
watched
beside
the
dead
chilled
by
the
cold
of
the
crossed
hands
awed
by
the
silence
half
frighted
by
the
shadows
on
the
wall
now
filled
with
natural
grief
now
with
surreptitious
and
shamefaced
thoughts
of
his
changed
estate
yesterday
son
and
dependent
heir
and
master
twelve
years
the
sigh
and
the
smile
were
not
for
the
dead
father
but
for
his
own
dead
youth
for
the
unjaded
freshness
of
the
morning
for
the
world
that
had
been
once
upon
a
time
turning
in
his
seat
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
man
who
had
followed
him
and
who
was
now
standing
between
the
table
and
the
door
well
friend
he
demanded
the
man
came
a
step
or
two
nearer
his
hat
was
in
his
hand
and
his
body
was
obsequiously
bent
but
there
was
no
discomposure
in
his
lifeless
voice
and
manner
i
stayed
to
explain
my
presence
in
the
house
sir
he
said
i
am
a
lover
of
reading
and
knowing
my
weakness
your
overseer
who
keeps
the
keys
of
the
house
has
been
so
good
as
to
let
me
from
time
to
time
come
here
to
this
room
to
mingle
in
more
delectable
company
than
i
can
choose
without
these
walls
your
honor
doubtless
remembers
yonder
goodly
assemblage
he
motioned
with
his
hand
toward
a
door
showing
a
closet
lined
with
bookshelves
i
remember
replied
haward
dryly
so
you
come
to
my
room
alone
at
night
and
occupy
yourself
in
reading
and
when
you
are
wearied
you
refresh
yourself
with
my
wine
as
he
spoke
he
clinked
together
the
bottle
and
glass
that
stood
beside
the
books
i
plead
guilty
to
the
wine
answered
the
intruder
as
lifelessly
as
ever
but
it
is
my
only
theft
i
found
the
bottle
below
and
did
not
think
it
would
be
missed
i
trust
that
your
honor
does
not
grudge
it
to
a
poor
devil
who
tastes
burgundy
somewhat
seldomer
than
does
your
worship
and
my
being
in
the
house
is
pure
innocence
your
overseer
knew
that
i
would
neither
make
nor
meddle
with
aught
but
the
books
or
he
would
not
have
given
me
the
key
to
the
little
door
which
i
now
restore
to
your
honor
keeping
he
advanced
and
deposited
upon
the
table
a
large
key
what
is
your
name
demanded
haward
leaning
back
in
his
chair
bartholomew
paris
sir
i
keep
the
school
down
by
the
swamp
where
i
impart
to
fifteen
or
twenty
of
the
youth
of
these
parts
the
rudiments
of
the
ancient
and
modern
tongues
mathematics
geography
fortifications
navigation
philosophy
haward
yawned
and
the
schoolmaster
broke
the
thread
of
his
discourse
i
weary
you
sir
he
said
i
will
with
your
permission
take
my
departure
may
i
make
so
bold
as
to
beg
your
honor
that
you
will
not
mention
to
the
gentlemen
hereabouts
the
small
matter
of
this
bottle
of
wine
i
would
wish
not
to
be
prejudiced
in
the
eyes
of
my
patrons
and
scholars
i
will
think
of
it
haward
replied
come
and
take
your
snuffbox
if
it
be
yours
from
the
book
where
you
have
left
it
it
is
mine
said
the
man
a
present
from
the
godly
minister
of
this
parish
as
he
spoke
he
put
out
his
hand
to
take
the
snuffbox
haward
leaned
forward
seized
the
hand
and
bending
back
the
fingers
exposed
the
palm
to
the
light
of
the
candles
upon
the
table
the
other
if
you
please
he
commanded
for
a
second
no
longer
a
wicked
soul
looked
blackly
out
of
the
face
to
which
he
had
raised
his
eyes
then
the
window
shut
and
the
wall
was
blank
again
without
any
change
in
his
listless
demeanor
the
schoolmaster
laid
his
left
hand
palm
out
beside
his
right
humph
exclaimed
haward
so
you
have
stolen
before
the
marks
are
old
when
were
you
branded
and
where
in
bristol
fifteen
years
ago
answered
the
man
unblushingly
it
was
all
a
mistake
i
was
as
innocent
as
a
newborn
babe
but
unfortunately
could
not
prove
it
interrupted
haward
that
is
of
course
go
on
i
was
transported
to
south
carolina
and
there
served
out
my
term
the
climate
did
not
suit
me
and
i
liked
not
the
society
nor
being
of
a
peaceful
disposition
the
constant
alarms
of
pirates
and
buccaneers
so
when
i
was
once
more
my
own
man
i
traveled
north
to
virginia
with
a
party
of
traders
in
my
youth
i
had
been
an
oxford
servitor
and
schoolmasters
are
in
demand
in
virginia
weighed
in
the
scales
with
a
knowledge
of
the
humanities
and
some
skill
in
imparting
them
what
matters
a
little
mishap
with
hot
irons
my
patrons
are
willing
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
my
school
flourishes
like
a
green
and
the
minister
of
this
parish
will
speak
for
the
probity
and
sobriety
of
my
conduct
now
i
will
go
sir
he
made
an
awkward
but
deep
and
obsequious
reverence
turned
and
went
out
of
the
door
passing
juba
who
was
entering
with
a
salver
laden
with
bread
and
meat
and
a
couple
of
bottles
put
down
the
food
juba
said
haward
and
see
this
gentleman
out
of
the
house
an
hour
later
the
master
dismissed
the
slave
and
sat
down
beside
the
table
to
finish
the
wine
and
compose
himself
for
the
night
the
overseer
had
come
hurrying
to
the
great
house
to
be
sent
home
again
by
a
message
from
the
owner
thereof
that
would
do
for
business
the
negro
women
who
had
been
called
to
make
the
bed
were
gone
the
noises
from
the
quarter
had
long
ceased
and
the
house
was
very
still
in
his
rich
figured
indian
nightgown
and
his
silken
nightcap
haward
sat
and
drank
his
wine
slowly
with
long
pauses
between
the
emptying
and
the
filling
of
the
slender
glass
a
window
was
open
and
the
wind
blowing
in
made
the
candles
to
flicker
with
the
wind
came
a
murmur
of
leaves
and
the
wash
of
the
river
stealthy
and
mournful
sounds
that
sorted
not
with
the
lighted
room
the
cheerful
homeliness
of
the
flowered
hangings
the
gleeful
lady
and
child
above
the
mantelshelf
haward
felt
the
incongruity
a
slow
sea
voyage
and
a
week
in
that
virginia
which
settled
one
hundred
and
twenty
years
before
was
yet
largely
forest
and
stream
had
weaned
him
he
thought
from
sounds
of
the
street
and
yet
he
missed
them
and
would
have
had
the
town
again
when
an
owl
hooted
in
the
outside
his
window
and
in
the
distance
as
far
away
as
the
creek
quarter
a
dog
howled
and
the
silence
closed
in
again
he
rose
and
began
to
walk
to
and
fro
slowly
thinking
of
the
past
and
the
future
the
past
had
its
ghosts
not
many
what
spectres
the
future
might
raise
only
itself
could
tell
so
far
as
mortal
vision
went
it
was
a
future
but
on
such
a
night
of
silence
that
was
not
silence
of
loneliness
that
was
filled
with
still
small
voices
of
heavy
darkness
without
of
lights
burning
in
an
empty
house
it
was
rather
of
ashes
of
roses
that
one
thought
haward
went
to
the
open
window
and
with
one
knee
upon
the
window
seat
looked
out
into
the
windy
starlit
night
this
was
the
eastern
face
of
the
house
and
beyond
the
waving
trees
there
were
visible
both
the
river
and
the
second
and
narrower
creek
which
on
this
side
bounded
the
plantation
the
voice
with
which
the
waters
swept
to
the
sea
came
strongly
to
him
a
large
white
moth
sailed
out
of
the
darkness
to
the
lit
window
but
his
presence
scared
it
away
looking
through
the
walnut
branches
he
could
see
a
light
that
burned
steadily
like
a
candle
set
in
a
window
for
a
moment
he
wondered
whence
it
shone
then
he
remembered
that
the
glebe
lands
lay
in
that
direction
the
parish
was
building
a
house
for
its
new
minister
when
he
left
virginia
those
many
years
ago
suddenly
he
recalled
that
the
minister
who
had
seemed
to
him
a
bluff
downright
honest
fellow
had
told
him
of
a
little
room
looking
out
upon
an
orchard
and
had
said
that
it
should
be
the
child
it
was
possible
that
the
star
which
pierced
the
darkness
might
mark
that
room
he
knit
his
brows
in
an
effort
to
remember
when
before
this
day
he
had
last
thought
of
a
child
whom
he
had
held
in
his
arms
and
comforted
one
splendid
dawn
upon
a
hilltop
in
a
mountainous
region
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
must
have
forgotten
her
quite
six
years
ago
well
she
would
seem
to
have
thriven
under
his
neglect
and
he
saw
again
the
girl
who
had
run
for
the
golden
guinea
it
was
true
that
when
he
had
put
her
there
where
that
light
was
shining
it
was
with
some
shadowy
idea
of
giving
her
gentle
breeding
of
making
a
lady
of
her
but
man
purposes
are
fleeting
and
often
gone
with
the
morrow
he
had
forgotten
his
purpose
and
perhaps
it
was
best
this
way
perhaps
it
was
best
this
way
for
a
little
longer
he
looked
at
the
light
and
listened
to
the
voice
of
the
river
then
he
rose
from
the
window
seat
drew
the
curtains
and
began
thoughtfully
to
prepare
for
bed
chapter
vii
the
return
of
monsieur
jean
hugon
to
the
north
the
glebe
was
bounded
by
a
thick
wood
a
rank
and
dense
second
growth
springing
from
earth
where
had
once
stood
decorously
apart
the
monster
trees
of
the
primeval
forest
a
wild
maze
of
young
trees
saplings
and
underbrush
overrun
from
the
tops
of
the
slender
bending
pines
to
the
bushes
of
dogwood
and
sassafras
and
the
rotting
ancient
stumps
and
fallen
logs
by
the
uncontrollable
vine
it
was
such
a
fantastic
thicket
as
one
might
look
to
find
in
fairyland
thorny
and
impenetrable
here
as
tall
as
a
ten
years
pine
there
sunken
away
to
the
height
of
the
wild
honeysuckles
everywhere
backed
by
blue
sky
heavy
with
odors
filled
with
the
flash
of
wings
and
the
songs
of
birds
to
the
east
the
thicket
fell
away
to
low
and
marshy
grounds
where
tall
cypresses
grew
and
myriads
of
myrtle
bushes
later
in
the
year
women
and
children
would
venture
in
upon
the
unstable
earth
for
the
sake
of
the
myrtle
berries
and
their
yield
of
fragrant
wax
and
once
and
again
an
outlying
slave
had
been
tracked
by
men
and
dogs
to
the
dark
recesses
of
the
place
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
given
over
to
its
immemorial
silence
to
the
south
and
the
west
the
tobacco
fields
of
fair
view
closed
in
upon
the
glebe
taking
the
fertile
river
bank
and
pressing
down
to
the
crooked
deeply
shadowed
creek
upon
whose
farther
bank
stood
the
house
of
the
rev
gideon
darden
a
more
retired
spot
a
completer
sequestration
from
the
world
of
mart
and
highway
it
would
have
been
hard
to
find
in
the
quiet
of
the
early
morning
when
the
shadows
of
the
trees
lay
across
the
dewy
grass
it
was
an
angle
of
the
earth
as
cloistral
and
withdrawn
as
heart
of
scholar
or
of
anchorite
could
wish
on
one
side
of
the
house
lay
a
tiny
orchard
and
the
windows
of
the
living
room
looked
out
upon
a
mist
of
pink
and
white
apple
blooms
the
fragrance
of
the
blossoms
had
been
in
the
room
but
could
not
prevail
against
the
odor
of
tobacco
and
rum
lately
introduced
by
the
master
of
the
house
and
minister
of
the
parish
audrey
sitting
beside
a
table
which
had
been
drawn
in
front
of
the
window
turned
her
face
aside
and
was
away
sense
and
soul
out
of
the
meanly
furnished
room
into
the
midst
of
the
great
bouquets
of
bloom
with
the
blue
between
and
above
darden
walking
up
and
down
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
the
tobacco
smoke
curling
like
an
aureole
around
his
bullet
head
glanced
toward
the
window
when
you
have
written
that
which
i
have
told
you
to
write
say
so
audrey
he
commanded
do
sit
there
staring
at
nothing
audrey
came
back
to
the
present
with
a
start
took
up
a
pen
and
drew
the
standish
nearer
of
gideon
darden

of

parish
in
virginia
to
the
several
queries
contained
in
my
lord

of

circular
letter
to
the
clergy
in

she
read
and
poised
her

in

read
out
the
questions
ordered

write
my
answer
to

going
to
a
side
table
be
mixed
for
himself
in
an
old
battered
silver
cap
a
generous
draught
of
bombo
then
with
the
drink
in
his
hand
walked
heavily
across
the
uncarpeted
floor
to
his
armchair
which
creaked
under
his
weight
as
he
sank
into
its
leathern
lap
he
put
down
the
rum
and
water
with
so
unsteady
a
hand
that
the
liquor
spilled
and
when
he
refilled
his
pipe
half
the
contents
of
his
tobacco
box
showered
down
upon
his
frayed
and
ancient
and
unclean
coat
and
breeches
from
the
pocket
of
the
latter
he
now
drew
forth
a
silver
coin
which
he
balanced
for
a
moment
upon
his
fat
forefinger
and
finally
sent
spinning
across
the
table
to
audrey
is
the
dregs
of
thy
guinea
child
that
paris
and
hugon
and
i
drank
at
the
crossroads
last
night
me
says
i
to
them
that
lass
of
mine
sha
have
a
drop
in
the
cup
and
say
hugon
what
hugon
said
did
not
appear
or
was
confided
to
the
depths
of
the
tankard
which
the
minister
raised
to
his
lips
audrey
looked
at
the
splendid
shilling
gleaming
upon
the
table
beside
her
but
made
no
motion
toward
taking
it
into
closer
possession
a
little
red
had
come
into
the
clear
brown
of
her
cheeks
she
was
a
young
girl
with
her
dreams
and
fancies
and
the
golden
guinea
would
have
made
a
dream
or
two
come
true
the
first
she
read
slowly
long
since
you
went
to
the
plantations
as
missionary
darden
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
his
eyes
uplifted
through
the
smoke
clouds
to
the
ceiling
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
for
the
better
answering
of
his
diocesan
lord
thirteen
years
come
day
he
dictated
gideon
darden
audrey
do
not
forget
thy
capitals
thirteen
years
lord
lord
the
years
how
they
fly
hast
it
down
audrey
audrey
writing
in
a
slow
fair
clerkly
hand
made
her
period
and
turned
to
the
bishop
second
question
you
any
other
church
before
you
came
to
that
which
you
now
possess
my
lord
said
the
minister
to
the
bishop
then
to
the
ceiling
i
came
raw
from
the
devil
to
this
parish
audrey
hast
ever
heard
children
say
that
satan
comes
and
walks
behind
me
when
i
go
through
the
forest
yes
said
audrey
but
their
eyes
are
not
good
you
go
hand
in
hand
darden
paused
in
the
lifting
of
his
tankard
thy
wits
are
brightening
audrey
but
keep
such
observations
to
thyself
it
is
only
the
schoolmaster
with
whom
i
walk
go
on
to
the
next
question
the
bishop
desired
to
know
how
long
the
minister
addressed
had
been
inducted
into
his
living
the
minister
addressed
leaning
forward
laid
it
off
to
his
lordship
how
that
the
vestries
in
virginia
did
not
incline
to
have
ministers
inducted
and
being
very
powerful
kept
the
poor
servants
of
the
church
upon
uneasy
seats
but
that
he
gideon
darden
had
the
love
of
his
flock
rich
and
poor
gentle
and
simple
and
that
in
the
first
year
of
his
ministry
the
gentlemen
of
his
vestry
had
been
pleased
to
present
his
name
to
the
governor
for
induction
which
explanation
made
the
minister
drank
more
rum
and
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
orchard
and
at
his
neighbor
tobacco
you
are
only
a
woman
and
can
hold
no
office
audrey
he
said
but
i
will
impart
to
you
words
of
wisdom
whose
price
is
above
rubies
always
agree
with
your
vestry
go
hat
in
hand
to
each
of
its
members
in
turn
craving
advice
as
to
the
management
of
your
own
affairs
thunder
from
the
pulpit
against
popery
which
does
not
exist
in
this
colony
and
the
pretender
who
is
at
present
in
italy
wrap
a
dozen
black
sheep
of
inferior
breed
in
white
sheets
and
set
them
arow
at
the
church
door
but
make
it
stuff
of
the
conscience
to
see
no
blemish
in
the
wealthier
and
more
honorable
portion
of
your
flock
so
you
will
thrive
and
come
to
be
inducted
into
your
living
whether
in
virginia
or
some
other
quarter
of
the
globe
what
the
worthy
bishop
next
demand
hasten
for
hugon
is
coming
this
morning
and
there
settlement
to
be
made
of
a
small
bet
and
a
hand
at
cards
by
the
circular
letter
and
the
lips
of
audrey
the
bishop
proceeded
to
propound
a
series
of
questions
which
the
minister
answered
with
portentous
glibness
in
the
midst
of
an
estimate
of
the
value
of
a
living
in
a
parish
a
face
looked
in
at
the
window
and
a
dark
and
sinewy
hand
laid
before
audrey
a
bunch
of
scarlet
columbine
the
rock
was
high
said
a
voice
and
the
pool
beneath
was
deep
and
dark
here
are
the
flowers
that
waved
from
the
rock
and
threw
colored
shadows
upon
the
pool
the
girl
shrank
as
from
a
sudden
and
mortal
danger
her
lips
trembled
her
eyes
half
closed
and
with
a
hurried
and
passionate
gesture
she
rose
from
her
chair
thrust
from
her
the
scarlet
blooms
and
with
one
lithe
movement
of
her
body
put
between
her
and
the
window
the
heavy
writing
table
the
minister
laid
by
his
sum
in
arithmetic
ha
hugon
dog
of
a
trader
he
cried
come
in
man
hast
brought
the
skins
there
upon
the
table
and
audrey
will
be
kind
stay
to
dinner
and
tell
us
what
lading
you
brought
down
river
and
of
your
kindred
in
the
forest
and
your
kindred
in
the
man
at
the
window
shrugged
his
shoulders
lifted
his
brows
and
spread
his
hands
so
a
captain
of
mousquetaires
might
have
done
but
the
face
was
the
were
high
the
black
eyes
large
fierce
and
restless
a
great
bushy
peruke
of
an
ancient
fashion
and
a
coarse
cravat
gave
setting
and
lent
a
touch
of
grotesqueness
and
of
terror
to
a
countenance
wherein
the
blood
of
the
red
man
warred
with
that
of
the
white
i
will
not
come
in
now
said
the
voice
again
i
am
going
in
my
boat
to
the
big
creek
to
take
twelve
doeskins
to
an
old
man
named
taberer
i
will
come
back
to
dinner
may
i
not
the
corners
of
the
lips
went
up
and
the
thicket
of
false
hair
swept
the
window
sill
so
low
did
the
white
man
bow
but
the
indian
eyes
were
watchful
audrey
made
no
answer
she
stood
with
her
face
turned
away
and
her
eyes
upon
the
door
measuring
her
chances
if
darden
would
let
her
pass
she
might
reach
the
stairway
and
her
own
room
before
the
trader
could
enter
the
house
there
were
bolts
to
its
heavy
door
and
hugon
might
do
as
he
had
done
before
and
talk
his
heart
out
upon
the
wrong
side
of
the
wood
thanks
be
lying
upon
her
bed
and
pressing
the
pillow
over
her
ears
she
did
not
have
to
hear
at
the
trader
announcement
that
his
present
path
led
past
the
house
she
ceased
her
stealthy
progress
toward
her
own
demesne
and
waited
with
her
back
to
the
window
and
her
eyes
upon
one
long
ray
of
sunshine
that
struck
high
against
the
wall
i
will
come
again
said
the
voice
without
and
the
apparition
was
gone
from
the
window
once
more
blue
sky
and
rosy
bloom
spanned
the
opening
and
the
sunshine
lay
in
a
square
upon
the
floor
the
girl
drew
a
long
breath
and
turning
to
the
table
began
to
arrange
the
papers
upon
it
with
trembling
hands
thousand
pounds
of
at
ten
shillings
the
hundredweight
for
marriage
by
banns
five
shillings
for
the
preaching
of
a
funeral
sermon
forty
shillings
for
christening
began
darden
for
the
bishop
information
audrey
took
her
pen
and
wrote
but
before
the
list
of
the
minister
perquisites
had
come
to
an
end
the
door
flew
open
and
a
woman
with
the
face
of
a
vixen
came
hurriedly
into
the
room
with
her
entered
the
breeze
from
the
river
driving
before
it
the
smoke
wreaths
and
blowing
the
papers
from
the
table
to
the
floor
darden
stamped
his
foot

the
minister
glanced
at
his
wife
then
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
and
nodded
dismissal
to
audrey
his
late
secretary
slipped
from
her
seat
and
left
the
room
not
without
alacrity
well
demanded
darden
when
the
sound
of
the
quick
young
feet
had
died
away
open
your
budget
deborah
there
naught
in

i
swear
but
some
about
your
flowered
gown
or
an
old
woman
black
cat
and
corner
broomstick
mistress
deborah
darden
pressed
her
thin
lips
together
and
eyed
her
lord
and
master
with
scant
measure
of
conjugal
fondness
it
about
some
one
nearer
home
than
your
bishops
and
commissaries
she
said
hide
passed
by
this
morning
going
to
the
river
field
i
was
in
the
garden
and
he
stopped
to
speak
to
me
haward
is
home
from
england
he
came
to
the
great
house
last
night
and
he
ordered
his
horse
for
ten
this
morning
and
asked
the
nearest
way
through
the
fields
to
the
parsonage
darden
whistled
and
put
down
his
drink
untasted
enter
the
most
powerful
gentleman
of
my
vestry
he
exclaimed
he
be
that
in
a
month
time
a
member
of
the
council
too
no
doubt
and
with
the
governor
ear
he
a
scholar
and
fine
gentleman
deborah
clear

this
trash
lay
out
my
books
fetch
a
bottle
of
canary
and
give

my
sunday
coat

on
the
table
and
a
dish
of
bonchrétiens
and
get
on
your
tabby
gown
make
your
curtsy
at
the
door
then
leave
him
to
me
and
audrey
said
his
wife
darden
about
to
rise
sank
back
again
and
sat
still
a
hand
upon
either
arm
of
his
chair
eh
he
said
then
in
a
meditative
tone
that
is
so
there
is
audrey
if
he
has
eyes
he
see
that
for
himself
retorted
mistress
deborah
tartly
to
the
purpose
he
say
is
the
money
that
i
gave
you
for
her
why
it
gone
answered
darden
gone
in
maintenance
gone
in
meat
and
drink
and
raiment
he
did
want
it
buried
pshaw
deborah
he
has
quite
forgot
his
plan
he
forgot
it
years
ago
i
swear
i
send
her
now
on
an
errand
to
the
widow
constance
said
the
mistress
of
the
house
then
before
he
comes
again
i
get
her
a
gown
the
minister
brought
his
hand
down
upon
the
table
you
do
no
such
thing
he
thundered
the
girl
got
to
be
here
when
he
comes
as
for
her
dress
ca
she
borrow
from
you
the
lord
knows
that
though
only
the
wife
of
a
poor
parson
you
might
throw
for
gewgaws
with
a
bona
roba
go
trick
her
out
and
bring
her
here
i
attend
to
the
wine
and
the
books
when
the
door
opened
again
and
audrey
alarmed
and
wondering
slipped
with
the
wind
into
the
room
and
stood
in
the
sunshine
before
the
minister
that
worthy
first
frowned
then
laughed
and
finally
swore
deborah
your
hand
is
out
if
i
had
taken
you
from
service
i
swear
that
you
were
never
inside
a
fine
lady
chamber
what
the
matter
with
the
girl
skirt
she
too
tall
cried
the
sometime
waiting
woman
angrily
as
for
that
great
stain
upon
the
silk
the
wine
made
it
when
you
threw
your
tankard
at
me
last
sunday
but
one
that
manteau
pins
her
arms
to
her
sides
interrupted
the
minister
calmly
and
the
lace
is
dirty
you
hidden
all
her
hair
under
that
mazarine
and
too
many
patches
become
not
a
brown
skin
turn
around
child
while
audrey
slowly
revolved
the
guardian
of
her
fortunes
leaning
back
in
his
chair
bent
his
bushy
brows
and
gazed
not
at
the
circling
figure
in
its
tawdry
apparel
but
into
the
distance
when
she
stood
still
and
looked
at
him
with
a
face
he
brought
his
bleared
eyes
to
bear
upon
her
studied
her
for
a
minute
then
motioned
to
his
wife
she
must
take
off
this
paltry
finery
deborah
he
announced
i
have
none
of
it
go
child
and
don
your
cinderella
gown
what
does
it
all
mean
cried
audrey
with
heaving
bosom
why
did
she
put
these
things
upon
me
and
why
will
she
tell
me
nothing
if
hugon
has
hand
in
it
the
minister
made
a
gesture
of
contempt
hugon
hugon
half
monacan
and
half
frenchman
is
bartering
skins
with
a
quaker
begone
child
and
when
you
are
transformed
return
to
us
when
the
door
had
closed
he
turned
upon
his
wife
the
girl
has
been
cared
for
he
said
she
has
been
fed
if
not
with
cates
and
dainties
then
with
bread
and
meat
she
has
been
clothed
if
not
in
silk
and
lace
then
in
good
blue
linen
and
penistone
she
is
young
and
of
the
springtime
hath
more
learning
than
had
many
a
princess
of
old
times
is
innocent
and
good
to
look
at
thou
and
the
rest
of
thy
sex
are
fools
deborah
but
wise
men
died
not
with
solomon
it
matters
not
about
her
dress
rising
he
went
to
a
shelf
of
battered
books
and
taking
down
an
armful
proceeded
to
strew
the
volumes
upon
the
table
the
red
blooms
of
the
columbine
being
in
the
way
he
took
up
the
bunch
and
tossed
it
out
of
the
window
with
the
light
thud
of
the
mass
upon
the
ground
eyes
of
husband
and
wife
met
hugon
would
marry
the
girl
said
the
latter
twisting
the
hem
of
her
apron
with
restless
fingers
without
change
of
countenance
darden
leaned
forward
seized
her
by
the
shoulder
and
shook
her
violently
you
are
too
given
to
idle
and
meaningless
words
deborah
he
declared
releasing
her
by
the
lord
one
of
these
days
i
break
you
of
the
habit
for
good
and
all
hugon
and
scarlet
flowers
and
who
will
marry
audrey
that
is
yet
but
a
child
and
useful
about
the
house
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
the
matter
in
hand
which
is
simply
to
make
ourselves
and
our
house
presentable
in
the
eyes
of
my
chief
parishioner
a
man
would
think
that
thirteen
years
in
virginia
would
teach
any
fool
the
necessity
of
standing
well
with
a
powerful
gentleman
such
as
this
i
no
coward
damn
sanctimonious
parsons
and
my
lord
bishop
scotch
hireling
if
they
yelp
much
longer
at
my
heels
scandalize
them
in
good
earnest
it
thin
ice
though
it
thin
ice
but
i
like
this
house
and
glebe
and
i
going
to
live
and
die
in
them
and
die
drunk
if
i
choose
commissary
to
the
contrary
it
of
import
deborah
that
my
parishioners
being
easy
folk
willing
to
live
and
let
live
should
like
me
still
and
that
a
majority
of
my
vestry
should
not
be
able
to
get
on
without
me
with
this
in
mind
get
out
the
wine
dust
the
best
chair
and
be
ready
with
thy
curtsy
it
will
be
time
enough
to
cry
audrey
banns
when
she
is
asked
in
marriage
audrey
in
her
brown
dress
with
the
color
yet
in
her
cheeks
entering
at
the
moment
mistress
deborah
attempted
no
response
to
her
adjuration
darden
turned
to
the
girl
i
done
with
the
writing
for
the
nonce
child
he
said
and
need
you
no
longer
i
smoke
a
pipe
and
think
of
my
sermon
you
tired
out
with
you
into
the
sunshine
go
to
the
wood
or
down
by
the
creek
but
not
beyond
call
d
mind
audrey
looked
from
one
to
the
other
but
said
nothing
there
were
many
things
in
the
world
of
other
people
which
she
did
not
understand
one
thing
more
or
less
made
no
great
difference
but
she
did
understand
the
sunlit
roof
the
twilight
halls
the
patterned
floor
of
the
forest
blossoms
drifting
down
fleeing
shadows
voices
of
wind
and
water
and
all
murmurous
elfin
life
spoke
to
her
they
spoke
the
language
of
her
land
when
she
stepped
out
of
the
door
into
the
air
and
faced
the
portals
of
her
world
they
called
to
her
to
come
lithe
and
slight
and
light
of
foot
she
answered
to
their
piping
the
orchard
through
which
she
ran
was
fair
with
its
rosy
trees
like
gayly
dressed
curtsying
dames
the
slow
clear
creek
that
held
the
double
of
the
sky
enticed
but
she
passed
it
by
straight
as
an
arrow
she
pierced
to
the
heart
of
the
wood
that
lay
to
the
north
thorn
and
bramble
branch
of
bloom
and
entangling
vine
stayed
her
not
long
since
she
had
found
or
had
made
for
herself
a
path
to
the
centre
of
the
labyrinth
here
was
a
older
by
many
a
year
than
the
young
wood
a
solitary
tree
spared
by
the
axe
what
time
its
mates
had
fallen
tall
and
the
column
of
the
trunk
rose
to
meet
wide
branches
and
the
green
of
tender
leaves
the
earth
beneath
was
clean
swept
and
carpeted
with
the
leaves
of
last
year
a
wide
dry
pale
brown
enchanted
ring
against
whose
borders
pressed
the
riot
of
the
forest
vine
and
bush
flower
and
fern
could
not
enter
but
audrey
came
and
laid
herself
down
upon
a
cool
and
shady
bed
by
human
measurement
the
house
that
she
had
left
was
hard
by
even
from
under
the
mistress
deborah
thin
call
could
draw
her
back
to
the
walls
which
sheltered
her
which
she
had
been
taught
to
call
her
home
but
it
was
not
her
soul
home
and
now
the
veil
of
the
kindly
woods
withdrew
it
league
on
league
shut
it
out
made
it
as
if
it
had
never
been
from
the
charmed
ring
beneath
the
she
took
possession
of
her
world
for
her
the
wind
murmured
the
birds
sang
insects
hummed
or
shrilled
the
green
saplings
nodded
their
heads
flowers
and
the
bedded
moss
and
the
little
stream
that
leaped
from
a
precipice
of
three
feet
into
the
calm
of
a
pool
spoke
to
her
she
was
happy
gone
was
the
house
and
its
inmates
gone
paris
the
schoolmaster
who
had
taught
her
to
write
and
whose
hand
touching
hers
in
guidance
made
her
sick
and
cold
gone
hugon
the
trader
whom
she
feared
and
hated
here
were
no
toil
no
annoy
no
frightened
flutterings
of
the
heart
she
had
passed
the
frontier
and
was
safe
in
her
own
land
she
pressed
her
cheek
against
the
dead
leaves
and
with
the
smell
of
the
earth
in
her
nostrils
looked
sideways
with
eyes
and
made
a
radiant
mist
of
the
forest
round
about
a
drowsy
warmth
was
in
the
air
the
birds
sang
far
away
through
a
rift
in
the
foliage
a
sunbeam
came
and
rested
beside
her
like
a
gilded
snake
for
a
time
wrapped
in
the
warmth
and
the
green
and
gold
mist
she
lay
as
quiet
as
the
sunbeam
of
the
earth
earthy
in
pact
with
the
mould
beneath
the
leaves
with
the
slowly
crescent
trunks
brown
or
with
moss
and
lichened
rock
and
with
all
life
that
basked
or
crept
or
flew
at
last
however
the
mind
aroused
and
she
opened
her
eyes
saw
and
thought
of
what
she
saw
it
was
pleasant
in
the
forest
she
watched
the
flash
of
a
bird
as
blue
as
the
sky
from
limb
to
limb
she
listened
to
the
elfin
waterfall
she
drew
herself
with
hand
and
arm
across
the
leaves
to
the
edge
of
the
pale
brown
ring
plucked
a
honeysuckle
bough
and
brought
it
back
to
the
silver
column
of
the
beech
and
lastly
glancing
up
from
the
rosy
sprig
within
her
hand
she
saw
a
man
coming
toward
her
down
the
path
that
she
had
thought
hidden
holding
his
arm
before
him
for
shield
against
brier
and
branch
and
looking
curiously
about
him
as
for
a
thing
which
he
had
come
out
to
seek
chapter
viii
under
the
greenwood
tree
in
the
moment
in
which
she
sprang
to
her
feet
she
saw
that
it
was
not
hugon
and
her
heart
grew
calm
again
in
her
torn
gown
with
her
brown
hair
loosed
from
its
fastenings
and
falling
over
her
shoulders
in
heavy
waves
whose
crests
caught
the
sunlight
she
stood
against
the
tree
beneath
which
she
had
lain
gazed
with
eyes
at
the
intruder
and
guessed
from
his
fine
coat
and
the
sparkling
toy
looping
his
hat
that
he
was
a
gentleman
she
knew
gentlemen
when
she
saw
them
on
a
time
one
had
cursed
her
for
scurrying
like
a
partridge
across
the
road
before
his
horse
making
the
beast
come
nigh
to
unseating
him
another
coming
upon
her
and
the
widow
constance
barbara
gathering
fagots
in
the
november
woods
had
tossed
to
each
a
sixpence
a
third
on
vestry
business
with
the
minister
had
touched
her
beneath
the
chin
and
sworn
that
an
she
were
not
so
brown
she
were
fair
a
fourth
lying
hidden
upon
the
bank
of
the
creek
had
caught
her
boat
head
as
she
pushed
it
into
the
reeds
and
had
tried
to
kiss
her
they
had
certain
ways
had
gentlemen
but
she
knew
no
great
harm
of
them
there
was
one
now
but
he
would
be
like
a
prince
when
at
eventide
the
sky
was
piled
with
pale
towering
clouds
and
she
looked
as
she
often
looked
down
the
river
toward
the
bay
and
the
sea
beyond
she
always
saw
this
prince
that
she
had
woven
warp
of
memory
woof
of
dreams
stand
erect
in
the
pearly
light
there
was
a
gentleman
indeed
as
to
the
possessor
of
the
title
now
slowly
and
steadily
making
his
way
toward
her
she
was
in
a
mere
state
of
wonder
it
was
not
possible
that
he
had
lost
his
way
but
if
so
she
was
sorry
that
in
losing
it
he
had
found
the
slender
zigzag
of
her
path
a
trustful
child
save
where
hugon
was
concerned
she
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
and
being
of
a
friendly
mind
looked
at
the
approaching
figure
with
shy
kindliness
and
thought
that
he
must
have
come
from
a
distant
part
of
the
country
she
thought
that
had
she
ever
seen
him
before
she
would
have
remembered
it
upon
the
outskirts
of
the
ring
clear
of
the
close
embrace
of
flowering
bush
and
spreading
vine
haward
paused
and
looked
with
smiling
eyes
at
this
girl
of
the
woods
this
forest
creature
that
springing
from
the
earth
had
set
its
back
against
the
tree
tarry
awhile
he
said
slip
not
yet
within
the
bark
had
i
known
i
should
have
brought
oblation
of
milk
and
honey
this
is
the
thicket
between
fair
view
and
the
glebe
lands
said
audrey
who
knew
not
what
bark
of
tree
and
milk
and
honey
had
to
do
with
the
case
over
yonder
sir
is
the
road
to
the
great
house
this
path
ends
here
you
must
go
back
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
then
turn
to
the
south
i
have
not
lost
my
way
answered
haward
still
smiling
it
is
pleasant
here
in
the
shade
after
the
warmth
of
the
open
may
i
not
sit
down
upon
the
leaves
and
talk
to
you
for
a
while
i
came
out
to
find
you
you
know
as
he
spoke
and
without
waiting
for
the
permission
which
he
asked
he
crossed
the
rustling
leaves
and
threw
himself
down
upon
the
earth
between
two
branching
roots
her
skirt
brushed
his
knee
with
a
movement
quick
and
shy
she
put
more
distance
between
them
then
stood
and
looked
at
him
with
wide
grave
eyes
why
do
you
say
that
you
came
here
to
find
me
she
asked
i
do
not
know
you
haward
laughed
nursing
his
knee
and
looking
about
him
let
that
pass
for
a
moment
you
have
the
prettiest
woodland
parlor
child
tell
me
do
they
treat
you
well
over
there
with
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
toward
the
glebe
house
madam
the
shrew
and
his
reverence
the
bully
are
they
kind
to
you
though
they
let
you
go
like
a
beggar
maid
he
glanced
kindly
enough
at
her
bare
feet
and
torn
gown
yet
they
starve
you
not
nor
beat
you
nor
deny
you
aught
in
reason
audrey
drew
herself
up
she
had
a
proper
pride
and
she
chose
to
forget
for
this
occasion
a
bruise
upon
her
arm
and
the
thrusting
upon
her
of
hugon
company
i
do
not
know
who
you
are
sir
that
ask
me
such
questions
she
said
sedately
i
have
food
and
shelter
and
and
kindness
and
i
go
barefoot
only
of
week
days
it
was
a
brave
beginning
but
of
a
sudden
she
found
it
hard
to
go
on
she
felt
his
eyes
upon
her
and
knew
that
he
was
unconvinced
and
into
her
own
eyes
came
the
large
tears
they
did
not
fall
but
through
them
she
saw
the
forest
swim
in
green
and
gold
i
have
no
father
or
mother
she
said
and
no
brother
or
sister
in
all
the
world
there
is
no
one
that
is
kin
to
me
her
voice
that
was
low
and
full
and
apt
to
fall
into
minor
cadences
died
away
and
she
stood
with
her
face
raised
and
slightly
turned
from
the
gentleman
who
lay
at
her
feet
stretched
out
upon
the
sere
beech
leaves
he
did
not
seem
inclined
to
speech
and
for
a
time
the
little
brook
and
the
birds
and
the
wind
in
the
trees
sang
undisturbed
these
woods
are
very
beautiful
said
haward
at
last
with
his
gaze
upon
her
but
if
the
land
were
less
level
it
were
more
to
my
taste
now
if
this
plain
were
a
little
valley
couched
among
the
hills
if
to
the
westward
rose
dark
blue
mountains
like
a
rampart
if
the
runlet
yonder
were
broad
and
clear
if
this
beech
were
a
he
broke
off
content
to
see
her
eyes
dilate
her
bosom
rise
and
fall
her
hand
go
trembling
for
support
to
the
column
of
the
beech
oh
the
mountains
she
cried
when
the
mist
lifted
when
the
cloud
rested
when
the
sky
was
red
behind
them
oh
the
clear
stream
and
the
and
the
cabin
who
are
you
how
did
you
know
about
these
things
were
you
were
you
there
she
turned
upon
him
with
her
soul
in
her
eyes
as
for
him
lying
at
length
upon
the
ground
he
locked
his
hands
beneath
his
head
and
began
to
sing
though
scarce
above
his
breath
he
sang
the
song
of
amiens
under
the
greenwood
tree
who
loves
to
lie
with
me
when
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
stanza
he
half
rose
and
turned
toward
the
mute
and
breathless
figure
leaning
against
the
for
her
the
years
had
rolled
back
one
moment
she
stood
upon
the
doorstep
of
the
cabin
and
the
air
was
filled
with
the
trampling
of
horses
with
quick
laughter
whistling
singing
and
the
call
of
a
trumpet
the
next
she
ran
in
and
in
terror
between
rows
of
rustling
corn
felt
again
the
clasp
of
her
pursuer
heard
at
her
ear
the
comfort
of
his
voice
a
film
came
between
her
eyes
and
the
man
at
whom
she
stared
and
her
heart
grew
cold
audrey
said
haward
come
here
child
the
blood
returned
to
her
heart
her
vision
cleared
and
her
arm
fell
from
its
clasp
upon
the
tree
the
bark
opened
not
the
hamadryad
had
lost
the
spell
when
at
his
repeated
command
she
crossed
to
him
she
went
as
the
trusting
dumbly
loving
dumbly
grateful
child
whose
life
he
had
saved
and
whose
comforter
protector
and
guardian
he
had
been
when
he
took
her
hands
in
his
she
was
glad
to
feel
them
there
again
and
she
had
no
blushes
ready
when
he
kissed
her
upon
the
forehead
it
was
sweet
to
her
who
hungered
for
affection
who
long
ago
had
set
his
image
up
loving
him
purely
as
a
sovereign
spirit
or
as
a
dear
and
great
elder
brother
to
hear
him
call
her
again
little
maid
tell
her
that
she
had
not
changed
save
in
height
ask
her
if
she
remembered
this
or
that
adventure
what
time
they
had
strayed
in
the
woods
together
remember
when
at
last
beneath
his
admirable
management
the
wonder
and
the
shyness
melted
away
and
she
found
her
tongue
memories
came
in
a
torrent
the
hilltop
the
deep
woods
and
the
giant
trees
the
house
he
had
built
for
her
out
of
stones
and
moss
the
grapes
they
had
gathered
the
fish
they
had
caught
the
thunderstorm
when
he
had
snatched
her
out
of
the
path
of
a
stricken
and
falling
pine
an
alarm
of
indians
an
alarm
of
wolves
finally
the
first
faint
sounds
of
the
returning
expedition
the
distant
trumpet
note
the
nearer
approach
the
bursting
again
into
the
valley
of
the
governor
and
his
party
the
journey
from
that
loved
spot
to
williamsburgh
all
sights
and
sounds
thoughts
and
emotions
of
that
time
fast
held
through
lonely
years
came
at
her
call
and
passed
again
in
procession
before
them
haward
first
amazed
then
touched
reached
at
length
the
conclusion
that
the
years
of
her
residence
beneath
the
minister
roof
could
not
have
been
happy
that
she
must
always
have
put
from
her
with
shuddering
and
horror
the
memory
of
the
night
which
orphaned
her
but
that
she
had
passionately
nursed
cherished
and
loved
all
that
she
had
of
sweet
and
dear
and
that
this
all
was
the
memory
of
her
childhood
in
the
valley
and
of
that
brief
season
when
he
had
been
her
savior
protector
friend
and
playmate
he
learned
also
for
she
was
too
simple
and
too
glad
either
to
withhold
the
information
or
to
know
that
she
had
given
it
that
in
her
girlish
and
innocent
imaginings
she
had
made
of
him
a
fairy
knight
clothing
him
in
a
panoply
of
power
mercy
and
tenderness
and
setting
him
on
high
so
high
that
his
very
heel
was
above
the
heads
of
the
mortals
within
her
ken
keen
enough
in
his
perceptions
he
was
able
to
recognize
that
here
was
a
pure
and
imaginative
spirit
strongly
yearning
after
ideal
strength
beauty
and
goodness
given
such
a
spirit
it
was
not
unnatural
that
turning
from
sordid
or
unhappy
surroundings
as
a
flower
turns
from
shadow
to
the
full
face
of
the
sun
she
should
have
taken
a
memory
of
valiant
deeds
kind
words
and
a
protecting
arm
and
have
created
out
of
these
a
man
after
her
own
heart
endowing
him
with
all
heroic
attributes
at
one
and
the
same
time
sending
him
out
into
the
world
a
without
fear
and
without
reproach
and
keeping
him
by
her
side
the
side
of
a
child
in
her
own
private
wonderland
he
saw
that
she
had
done
this
and
he
was
ashamed
he
did
not
tell
her
that
that
fortnight
was
to
him
but
a
incident
of
a
crowded
life
and
that
to
all
intents
and
purposes
she
herself
had
been
forgotten
for
one
thing
it
would
have
hurt
her
for
another
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
tell
her
upon
occasion
he
could
be
as
ruthless
as
a
stone
if
he
were
so
now
he
knew
it
not
but
in
deceiving
her
deceived
himself
man
of
a
world
that
was
corrupt
enough
he
was
of
course
quietly
assured
that
he
could
bend
this
woodland
creature
half
child
half
dryad
to
the
form
of
his
bidding
to
do
so
was
in
his
power
but
not
his
pleasure
he
meant
to
leave
her
as
she
was
to
accept
the
adoration
of
the
child
but
to
attempt
no
awakening
of
the
woman
the
girl
was
of
the
mountains
and
their
higher
colder
purer
air
though
he
had
brought
her
body
thence
he
would
not
have
her
spirit
leave
the
climbing
earth
the
dreamlike
summits
for
the
hot
and
dusty
plain
the
plain
god
knew
had
dwellers
enough
she
was
a
thing
of
wild
and
sylvan
grace
and
there
was
fulfillment
in
a
dark
beauty
all
her
own
of
the
promise
she
had
given
as
a
child
about
her
was
a
pathos
too
the
pathos
of
the
flower
taken
from
its
proper
soil
and
drooping
in
earth
which
nourished
it
not
haward
looking
at
her
watching
the
sensitive
mobile
lips
reading
in
the
dark
eyes
beneath
the
felicity
of
the
present
a
hint
and
prophecy
of
woe
felt
for
her
a
pity
so
real
and
great
that
for
the
moment
his
heart
ached
as
for
some
sorrow
of
his
own
she
was
only
a
young
girl
poor
and
helpless
born
of
poor
and
helpless
parents
dead
long
ago
there
was
in
her
veins
no
gentle
blood
she
had
none
of
the
world
goods
her
gown
was
torn
her
feet
went
bare
she
had
youth
but
not
its
heritage
of
gladness
beauty
but
none
to
see
it
a
nature
that
reached
toward
light
and
height
and
for
its
home
the
house
which
he
had
lately
left
he
was
a
man
older
by
many
years
than
the
girl
beside
him
knowing
good
and
evil
by
instinct
preferring
the
former
but
at
times
stooping
to
that
degree
of
the
latter
which
a
lax
and
gay
world
held
to
be
not
incompatible
with
a
convention
somewhat
misnamed
the
honor
of
a
gentleman
now
beneath
the
in
the
forest
which
touched
upon
one
side
the
glebe
upon
the
other
his
own
lands
he
chose
at
this
time
the
good
said
to
himself
and
believed
the
thing
he
said
that
in
word
and
in
deed
he
would
prove
himself
her
friend
putting
out
his
hand
he
drew
her
down
upon
the
leaves
and
she
sat
beside
him
still
and
happy
ready
to
answer
him
when
he
asked
her
this
or
that
readier
yet
to
sit
in
blissful
dreamy
silence
she
was
as
pure
as
the
flower
which
she
held
in
her
hand
and
most
innocent
in
her
imaginings
this
was
a
very
perfect
knight
a
great
gentleman
good
and
pitiful
that
had
saved
her
from
the
indians
when
she
was
a
little
girl
and
had
been
kind
to
her
ah
so
kind
in
that
dreadful
night
when
she
had
lost
father
and
mother
and
brother
and
sister
when
in
the
darkness
her
childish
heart
was
a
stone
for
terror
he
had
come
like
god
from
the
mountains
and
straightway
she
was
safe
now
into
her
woods
from
over
the
sea
he
had
come
again
and
at
once
the
load
upon
her
heart
the
dull
longing
and
misery
the
fear
of
hugon
were
lifted
the
chaplet
which
she
laid
at
his
feet
was
not
loosely
woven
of
flowers
but
was
compact
of
austerer
blooms
of
gratitude
reverence
and
that
love
which
is
only
a
longing
to
serve
the
glamour
was
at
hand
the
enchanted
light
which
breaks
not
from
the
east
or
the
west
or
the
north
or
the
south
was
upon
its
way
but
she
knew
it
not
and
she
was
happy
in
her
ignorance
i
am
tired
of
the
city
he
said
now
i
shall
stay
in
virginia
a
longing
for
the
river
and
the
marshes
and
the
house
where
i
was
born
came
upon
me
i
know
she
answered
when
i
shut
my
eyes
i
see
the
cabin
in
the
valley
and
when
i
dream
it
is
of
things
which
happen
in
a
mountainous
country
i
am
alone
in
the
great
house
he
continued
and
the
floors
echo
somewhat
loudly
the
garden
too
beside
myself
there
is
no
one
to
smell
the
roses
or
to
walk
in
the
moonlight
i
had
forgotten
the
isolation
of
these
great
plantations
each
is
a
province
and
a
despotism
if
the
despot
has
neither
kith
nor
kin
has
not
yet
made
friends
and
cares
not
to
draw
company
from
the
quarters
he
is
lonely
they
say
that
there
are
ladies
in
virginia
whose
charms
outweigh
their
dowries
of
and
oronoko
i
will
wed
such
an
one
and
have
laughter
in
my
garden
and
other
footsteps
than
my
own
in
my
house
there
are
beautiful
ladies
in
these
parts
said
audrey
there
is
the
one
that
gave
me
the
guinea
for
my
running
yesterday
she
was
so
very
fair
i
wished
with
all
my
heart
that
i
were
like
her
she
is
my
friend
said
haward
slowly
and
her
mind
is
as
fair
as
her
face
i
will
tell
her
your
story
the
gilded
streak
upon
the
earth
beneath
the
beech
had
crept
away
but
over
the
ferns
and
weeds
and
flowering
bushes
between
the
slight
trees
without
the
ring
the
sunshine
gloated
the
blue
of
the
sky
was
wonderful
and
in
the
silence
haward
and
audrey
heard
the
wind
whisper
in
the
treetops
a
dove
moaned
and
a
hare
ran
past
it
was
i
who
brought
you
from
the
mountains
and
placed
you
here
said
haward
at
last
i
thought
it
for
the
best
and
that
when
i
sailed
away
i
left
you
to
a
safe
and
happy
life
it
seems
that
i
was
mistaken
but
now
that
i
am
at
home
again
child
i
wish
you
to
look
upon
me
who
am
so
much
your
elder
as
your
guardian
and
protector
still
if
there
is
anything
which
you
lack
if
you
are
misused
are
in
need
of
help
why
think
that
your
troubles
are
the
indians
again
little
maid
and
turn
to
me
once
more
for
help
having
spoken
honestly
and
well
and
very
unwisely
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
said
that
it
was
late
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
audrey
did
not
move
and
when
he
looked
down
upon
her
he
saw
that
her
eyes
that
had
been
wet
were
overflowing
he
put
out
his
hand
and
she
took
it
and
touched
it
with
her
lips
then
because
he
said
that
he
had
not
meant
to
set
her
crying
she
smiled
and
with
her
own
hand
dashed
away
the
tears
when
i
ride
this
way
i
shall
always
stop
at
the
minister
house
said
haward
when
if
there
is
aught
which
you
need
or
wish
you
must
tell
me
of
it
think
of
me
as
your
friend
child
he
laid
his
hand
lightly
and
caressingly
upon
her
head
the
ruffles
at
his
wrist
soft
fine
and
perfumed
brushed
her
forehead
and
her
eyes
the
path
through
your
labyrinth
to
its
beechen
heart
was
hard
to
find
he
continued
but
i
can
easily
retrace
it
no
trouble
not
yourself
child
stay
for
a
time
where
you
are
i
wish
to
speak
to
the
minister
alone
his
hand
was
lifted
audrey
felt
rather
than
saw
him
go
only
a
few
feet
and
the
dogwood
stars
the
purple
mist
of
the
the
white
fragrance
of
a
wild
cherry
came
like
a
painted
arras
between
them
for
a
time
she
could
hear
the
movement
of
the
branches
as
he
put
them
aside
but
presently
this
too
ceased
and
the
place
was
left
to
her
and
to
all
the
life
that
called
it
home
it
was
the
same
wood
surely
into
which
she
had
run
two
hours
before
and
yet
and
yet
when
her
tears
were
spent
and
she
stood
up
leaning
with
her
loosened
hair
and
her
gown
that
was
the
color
of
oak
bark
against
the
she
looked
about
her
and
wondered
the
wonder
did
not
last
for
she
found
an
explanation
it
has
been
blessed
said
audrey
with
all
reverence
and
simplicity
and
that
is
why
the
light
is
so
different
chapter

to
the
rescue
saunderson
the
overseer
having
laboriously
written
and
signed
a
pass
laid
down
the
quill
wiped
his
inky
forefinger
upon
his
sleeve
and
gave
the
paper
to
the
storekeeper
who
sat
idly
by
ye
remember
that
the
store
chiefly
lacks
in
broadcloth
of
witney
frieze
and
camlet
and
in
women
shoes
both
silk
and
callimanco
and

for

small
swords
a

and

that
you
have
the
skins
worth
alick
an
awfu
man
to
get
the
upper
hand
of
i
thinking
a
maclean
should
have
small
difficulty
with
a
ker
said
the
storekeeper
dryly
what
i
wanting
to
know
is
why
i
am
saddled
with
the
company
of
monsieur
jean
hugon
he
jerked
his
thumb
toward
the
figure
of
the
trader
standing
within
the
doorway
i
do
not
like
the
gentleman
and
i
rather
trudge
it
to
williamsburgh
alone
ye
ken
not
the
value
of
the
skins
nor
how
to
show
them
off
answered
the
other
wherefore
for
the
consideration
of
a
measure
of
rum
engaged
to
help
you
in
the
trading
as
for
his
being
half
indian
gude
guide
us
it
been
told
me
that
no
so
many
centuries
ago
the
highlandmen
painted
their
bodies
and
went
into
battle
without
taking
advantage
even
of
feathers
and
silk
grass
one
half
of
him
is
of
the
french
nobeelity
he
told
me
as
much
himself
and
the
best
of
ye
sic
as
the
campbells
are
no
better
than
that
he
looked
at
maclean
with
a
caustic
smile
the
latter
shrugged
his
shoulders
so
long
as
you
tie
him
neck
and
heels
with
a
campbell
i
am
content
he
answered
are
you
going
i
just
bar
the
windows
and
lock
the
door
and
then
i
be
off
with
yonder
copper
cadet
of
a
french
house
to
you
i
be
back
ye
better
said
the
overseer
with
another
widening
of
his
thin
lips
for
myself
i
bear
ye
no
for
my
grandmither
rest
her
soul
came
frae
the
north
and
i
aye
thought
a
stewart
better
became
the
throne
than
a
body
frae
hanover
but
if
the
store
is
not
open
the
morn
i
raise
hue
and
cry
and
that
without
wasting
time
been
told
ye
great
huntsmen
in
the
highlands
if
ye
choose
to
turn
red
deer
yourself
i
give
ye
a
chase
trade
ye
down
man
and
track
ye
maclean
half
turned
from
the
window
i
have
hunted
the
red
deer
he
said
in
the
land
where
i
was
born
and
which
i
shall
see
no
more
and
i
have
been
myself
hunted
in
the
land
where
i
shall
die
i
have
run
until
i
have
fallen
and
i
have
felt
the
teeth
of
the
dogs
were
god
to
send
a
miracle
which
he
will
not
do
and
i
were
to
go
back
to
the
glen
and
the
crag
and
the
deep
birch
woods
i
suppose
that
i
would
hunt
again
would
drive
the
stag
to
bay
holloing
to
my
hounds
and
thinking
the
sound
of
the
horns
sweet
music
in
my
ears
it
is
the
way
of
the
earth
hunter
and
hunted
we
make
the
world
and
the
pity
of
it
setting
to
work
again
he
pushed
to
the
heavy
shutters
you
find
them
open
in
the
morning
he
said
and
find
me
selling
selling
clothing
that
i
may
not
wear
wine
that
i
may
not
drink
powder
and
shot
that
i
may
not
spend
swords
that
i
may
not
use
and
giving
giving
pride
manhood
honor
heart
blood
he
broke
off
shot
to
the
bar
across
the
shutters
and
betook
himself
in
silence
to
the
other
window
where
presently
he
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
the
sound
was
harsh
even
to
savagery
go
your
ways
saunderson
he
said
i
tried
the
bars
of
the
cage
they
too
strong
stop
on
your
morning
round
and
i
give
account
of
my
trading
the
overseer
gone
the
windows
barred
and
the
heavy
door
shut
and
locked
behind
him
maclean
paused
upon
the
doorstep
to
look
down
upon
his
appointed
companion
the
trader
half
sitting
half
reclining
upon
a
log
was
striking
at
something
with
the
point
of
his
lightly
delicately
and
often
the
something
was
a
lizard
about
which
as
it
lay
in
the
sunshine
upon
the
log
he
had
wrought
a
pen
of
leafy
twigs
the
creature
darting
for
liberty
this
way
and
that
was
met
at
every
turn
by
the
steel
and
at
every
turn
suffered
a
new
wound
maclean
looked
then
bent
over
and
with
a
heavy
stick
struck
the
thing
out
of
its
pain
there
a
time
to
work
and
a
time
to
play
hugon
he
said
coolly
playtime
over
now
the
sun
is
high
and
isaac
and
the
oxen
must
have
the
skins
to
williamsburgh
up
with
you
hugon
rose
to
his
feet
slid
his
knife
into
its
sheath
and
announced
in
good
enough
english
that
he
was
ready
he
had
youth
the
slender
hardy
perfectly
moulded
figure
of
the
indian
a
coloring
and
a
countenance
that
were
not
of
the
white
and
not
of
the
brown
when
he
went
up
the
river
past
the
thickly
settled
country
past
the
falls
past
the
french
town
which
his
huguenot
father
had
helped
to
build
into
the
deep
woods
and
to
the
indian
village
whence
had
strayed
his
mother
he
wore
the
clothing
that
became
the
woods
beaded
moccasins
fringed
leggings
of
deerskin
cap
of
fur
looked
his
part
and
played
it
well
when
he
came
back
to
an
english
country
to
wharves
and
stores
to
halls
and
porches
of
great
houses
and
parlors
of
lesser
ones
to
the
streets
and
ordinaries
of
williamsburgh
he
pulled
on
jack
boots
shrugged
himself
into
a
coat
with
silver
buttons
stuck
lace
of
a
quality
at
neck
and
wrists
wore
a
cocked
hat
and
a
blenheim
wig
and
became
a
figure
alike
grotesque
and
terrible
two
thirds
of
the
time
his
business
caused
him
to
be
in
the
forests
that
were
far
away
but
when
he
returned
to
civilization
to
stare
it
in
the
face
and
brag
within
himself
i
am
lot
and
part
of
what
i
see
he
dwelt
at
the
crossroads
ordinary
drank
and
gamed
with
paris
the
schoolmaster
and
darden
the
minister
and
dreamed
at
times
of
darden
audrey
the
miles
to
williamsburgh
were
long
and
sunny
with
the
dust
thick
beneath
the
feet
warm
and
heavy
the
scented
spring
possessed
the
land
it
was
a
day
for
drowsing
in
the
shade
for
them
who
must
needs
walk
in
the
sunshine
languor
of
thought
overtook
them
and
sparsity
of
speech
they
walked
rapidly
step
with
step
their
two
lean
and
sinewy
bodies
casting
the
same
length
of
shadow
but
they
kept
their
eyes
upon
the
long
glare
of
white
dust
and
told
not
their
dreams
at
a
point
in
the
road
where
the
storekeeper
saw
only
confused
marks
and
a
powdering
of
dust
upon
the
roadside
bushes
the
announced
that
there
had
been
that
morning
a
scuffle
in
a
gang
of
negroes
that
a
small
man
had
been
thrown
heavily
to
the
earth
and
a
large
man
had
made
off
across
a
low
ditch
into
the
woods
that
the
overseer
had
parted
the
combatants
and
that
some
one
back
had
bled
no
sooner
was
this
piece
of
clairvoyance
aired
than
he
was
vexed
that
he
had
shown
a
of
the
savage
and
hastily
explained
that
life
in
the
woods
such
as
a
trader
must
live
would
teach
any
man
an
englishman
now
as
well
as
a
frenchman
how
to
read
what
was
written
on
the
earth
farther
on
when
they
came
to
a
miniature
glen
between
the
semblance
of
two
hills
down
which
in
mockery
of
a
torrent
brabbled
a
slim
brown
stream
maclean
stood
still
gazed
for
a
minute
then
whistling
caught
up
with
his
companion
and
spoke
at
length
upon
the
subject
of
the
skins
awaiting
them
at
williamsburgh
the
road
had
other
travelers
than
themselves
at
intervals
a
cloud
of
dust
would
meet
or
overtake
them
and
out
of
the
windows
of
coach
or
chariot
or
lighter
chaise
faces
would
glance
at
them
in
the
thick
dust
wheels
and
horses
hoofs
made
no
noise
the
black
coachmen
sat
still
upon
the
boxes
the
faces
were
languid
with
the
springtime
a
moment
and
all
were
gone
oftener
there
passed
a
horseman
if
he
were
riding
the
planter
pace
he
went
by
like
a
whirlwind
troubling
only
to
curse
them
out
of
his
path
if
he
had
more
leisure
he
threw
them
a
or
perhaps
drew
rein
to
ask
this
or
that
of
hugon
the
trader
was
well
known
and
was
an
authority
upon
all
matters
pertaining
to
hunting
or
trapping
the
foot
passengers
were
few
for
in
virginia
no
man
walked
that
could
ride
and
on
a
morn
of
early
may
they
that
walked
were
like
to
be
busy
in
the
fields
an
ancient
seaman
lame
and
vagabond
lurched
beside
them
for
a
while
then
lagged
behind
a
witch
old
and
bowed
and
bleared
of
eye
crossed
their
path
and
a
sapony
hunter
with
three
wolves
heads
slung
across
his
shoulder
slipped
by
them
on
his
way
to
claim
the
reward
decreed
by
the
assembly
at
a
turn
of
the
road
they
came
upon
a
small
ordinary
with
horses
fastened
before
it
and
with
laughter
oaths
and
the
rattling
of
dice
issuing
from
the
open
windows
the
trader
had
money
the
storekeeper
had
none
the
latter
though
he
was
thirsty
would
have
passed
on
but
hugon
twitched
him
by
the
sleeve
and
producing
from
the
depths
of
his
great
flapped
pocket
a
handful
of
crusadoes
écues
and
pieces
of
eight
indicated
with
a
flourish
that
he
was
prepared
to
share
with
his
less
fortunate
companion
they
drank
standing
kissed
the
girl
who
served
them
and
took
to
the
road
again
there
were
no
more
thick
woods
the
road
running
in
a
blaze
of
sunshine
past
clumps
of
cedars
and
wayside
tangles
of
blackberry
sumac
and
elder
presently
beyond
a
group
of
elms
came
into
sight
the
goodly
college
of
william
and
mary
and
dazzling
white
against
the
blue
the
spire
of
bruton
church
within
a
wide
pasture
pertaining
to
the
college
close
to
the
roadside
and
under
the
boughs
of
a
vast
poplar
half
a
score
of
students
were
at
play
their
lithe
young
bodies
were
dark
of
hue
and
were
not
overburdened
with
clothing
their
countenances
remained
unmoved
without
laughter
or
grimacing
and
no
excitement
breathed
in
the
voices
with
which
they
called
one
to
another
in
deep
gravity
they
tossed
a
ball
or
pitched
a
quoit
or
engaged
in
wrestling
a
white
man
with
a
singularly
pure
and
gentle
face
sat
upon
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
watched
the
studious
efforts
of
his
pupils
with
an
approving
smile
wildcats
to
purr
upon
the
hearth
and
indians
to
go
to
school
quoth
maclean
were
you
taught
here
hugon
and
did
you
play
so
sadly
the
trader
his
head
held
very
high
drew
out
a
large
and
bedizened
snuffbox
and
took
snuff
with
ostentation
my
father
was
of
a
great
tribe
i
would
say
a
great
house
in
the
country
called
france
he
explained
with
dignity

of
a
very
great
name

length
in
the
ground
monsieur
le
marquis
calls
me
to
him
says
he
and
his
voice
is
like
the
ice
in
the
stream
you

ten
years
and
your
father
may
bon
pardon
his
sins

left
his
wishes
regarding

the
indian
school
which
the
english

built
near
to
the
great
college
in
their
town
of
williamsburgh

money

your
father
you
shall
be
fitted
out
as
a
trader
go
yes
i
went
to
school
here
but
i
learned
fast
and
did
not
forget
the
things
i
learned
and
i
played
with
the
english
boys
there
being
no
scholars
from
france
on
the
other
side
of
the
pasture
he
waved
his
hand
toward
an
irruption
of
laughing
shouting
figures
from
the
north
wing
of
the
college
the
white
man
under
the
tree
had
been
quietly
observant
of
the
two
wayfarers
and
he
now
rose
to
his
feet
and
came
over
to
the
rail
fence
against
which
they
leaned
ha
jean
hugon
he
said
pleasantly
touching
with
his
thin
white
hand
the
brown
one
of
the
trader
i
thought
it
had
been
my
old
scholar
canst
say
the
belief
and
the
commandments
yet
jean
yonder
great
fellow
with
the
ball
is
meshawa
meshawa
that
was
a
little
little
fellow
when
you
went
away
all
your
other
playmates
are
gone
though
you
did
not
play
much
jean
but
gloomed
and
gloomed
because
you
must
stay
this
side
of
the
meadow
with
your
own
color
will
you
not
cross
the
fence
and
sit
awhile
with
your
old
master
as
he
spoke
he
regarded
with
a
humorous
smile
the
dusty
glories
of
his
sometime
pupil
and
when
he
had
come
to
an
end
he
turned
and
made
as
if
to
beckon
to
the
indian
with
the
ball
but
hugon
drew
his
hand
away
straightened
himself
and
set
his
face
like
a
flint
toward
the
town
i
am
sorry
i
have
no
time
he
said
stiffly
my
friend
and
i
have
business
in
town
with
men
of
my
own
color
my
color
is
white
i
do
not
want
to
see
meshawa
or
the
others
i
have
forgotten
them
he
turned
away
but
a
thought
striking
him
his
face
brightened
and
plunging
his
hand
into
his
pocket
he
again
brought
forth
his
glittering
store
nowadays
i
have
money
he
said
grandly
it
used
to
be
that
indian
braves
brought
meshawa
and
the
others
presents
because
they
were
the
sons
of
their
great
men
i
was
the
son
of
a
great
man
too
but
he
was
not
indian
and
he
was
lying
in
his
grave
and
no
one
brought
me
gifts
now
i
wish
to
give
presents

ten
coins
master

one
to
each
indian
boy
the
largest
to
meshawa
the
indian
teacher
charles
griffin
by
name
looked
with
a
whimsical
face
at
the
silver
pieces
laid
arow
upon
the
top
rail
very
well
jean
he
said
it
is
good
to
give
of
thy
substance
meshawa
and
the
others
will
have
a
feast
yes
i
will
remember
to
tell
them
to
whom
they
owe
it
to
you
both
the
meadow
the
solemnly
playing
indians
and
their
gentle
teacher
were
left
behind
and
the
two
men
passing
the
long
college
all
astare
with
windows
the
indian
school
and
an
expanse
of
grass
starred
with
buttercups
came
into
duke
of
gloucester
street
broad
unpaved
deep
in
dust
shaded
upon
its
ragged
edges
by
mulberries
and
poplars
it
ran
without
shadow
of
turning
from
the
gates
of
william
and
mary
to
the
wide
sweep
before
the
capitol
houses
bordered
it
flush
with
the
street
or
set
back
in
fragrant
gardens
other
and
narrower
ways
opened
from
it
half
way
down
its
length
wide
greens
where
the
buttercups
were
thick
in
the
grass
stretched
north
and
south
beyond
these
greens
were
more
houses
more
mulberries
and
poplars
and
finally
closing
the
vista
the
brick
façade
of
the
capitol
the
two
from
fair
view
plantation
kept
their
forest
gait
for
the
trader
was
in
a
hurry
to
fulfill
his
part
of
the
bargain
which
was
merely
to
exhibit
and
value
the
skins
there
was
an
ordinary
in
nicholson
street
that
was
to
his
liking
sailors
gamed
there
and
other
traders
and
half
a
dozen
younger
sons
of
broken
gentlemen
it
was
as
cleanly
dining
in
its
chief
room
as
in
the
woods
and
the
aqua
vitæ
if
bad
was
cheap
in
good
humor
with
himself
and
by
nature
lavish
with
his
earnings
he
offered
to
make
the
storekeeper
his
guest
for
the
day
the
latter
curtly
declined
the
invitation
he
had
bread
and
meat
in
his
wallet
and
wanted
no
drink
but
water
he
would
dine
beneath
the
trees
on
the
market
green
would
finish
his
business
in
town
and
be
half
way
back
to
the
plantation
while
the
trader
being
his
own
man
with
no
fear
of
hue
and
cry
if
he
were
missed
was
still
at
hazard
this
question
settled
the
two
kept
each
other
company
for
several
hours
longer
at
the
end
of
which
time
they
issued
from
the
store
at
which
the
greater
part
of
their
business
had
been
transacted
and
went
their
several
ways
hugon
to
the
ordinary
in
nicholson
street
and
maclean
to
his
dinner
beneath
the
sycamores
on
the
green
when
the
frugal
meal
had
been
eaten
the
latter
recrossed
the
sward
to
the
street
and
took
up
again
the
round
of
his
commissions
it
was
after
three
by
the
great
clock
in
the
cupola
of
the
capitol
when
he
stood
before
the
door
of
alexander
ker
the
silversmith
and
found
entrance
made
difficult
by
the
serried
shoulders
of
half
a
dozen
young
men
standing
within
the
store
laughing
and
making
bantering
speeches
to
some
one
hidden
from
the
highlander
vision
presently
an
appealing
voice
followed
by
a
low
cry
proclaimed
that
the
some
one
was
a
woman
maclean
had
a
lean
and
wiry
strength
which
had
stood
him
in
good
stead
upon
more
than
one
occasion
in
his
checkered
career
he
now
drove
an
arm
like
a
bar
of
iron
between
two
broadcloth
coats
sent
the
wearers
thereof
to
right
and
left
and
found
himself
one
of
an
inner
ring
and
facing
mistress
truelove
taberer
who
stood
at
bay
against
the
silversmith
long
table
one
arm
was
around
the
boy
who
had
rowed
her
to
the
fair
view
store
a
week
agone
with
the
other
she
was
defending
her
face
from
the
attack
of
a
beribboned
gallant
desirous
of
a
kiss
the
boy
a
slender
delicate
lad
of
fourteen
struggled
to
free
himself
from
his
sister
restraining
arm
his
face
white
with
passion
and
his
breath
coming
in
gasps
let
me
go
truelove
he
commanded
if
i
am
a
friend
i
am
a
man
as
well
thou
fellow
with
the
shoulder
knots
thee
shall
pay
dearly
for
thy
insolence
truelove
tightened
her
hold
ephraim
ephraim
if
a
man
compel
thee
to
go
with
him
a
mile
thee
is
to
go
with
him
twain
if
he
take
thy
cloak
thee
is
to
give
him
thy
coat
also
if
he
ah
she
buried
her
profaned
cheek
in
her
arm
and
began
to
cry
but
very
softly
her
tormentors
flushed
with
wine
and
sworn
to
obtain
each
one
a
kiss
laughed
more
loudly
and
one
young
rake
with
wig
and
ruffles
awry
lurched
forward
to
take
the
place
of
the
coxcomb
who
had
scored
ephraim
wrenched
himself
free
and
making
for
this
gentleman
might
have
given
or
received
bodily
injury
had
not
a
heavy
hand
falling
upon
his
shoulder
stopped
him
in
stand
aside
boy
said
maclean
this
quarrel
mine
by
virtue
of
my
making
it
so
mistress
truelove
you
shall
have
no
further
annoyance
now
you
lowland
cowards
that
can
not
see
a
flower
bloom
but
you
wish
to
trample
it
in
the
mire
come
taste
the
ground
yourself
and
be
taught
that
the
flower
is
out
of
reach
as
he
spoke
he
stepped
before
the
quakeress
weaponless
but
with
his
eyes
like
steel
the
half
dozen
spendthrifts
and
whom
he
faced
paused
but
long
enough
to
see
that
this
newly
arrived
champion
had
only
his
bare
hands
and
was
by
token
of
his
dress
undoubtedly
their
inferior
before
setting
upon
him
with
drunken
laughter
and
the
loudly
avowed
purpose
of
administering
a
drubbing
the
one
that
came
first
he
sent
rolling
to
the
floor
another
for
hector
he
said
coolly
the
silversmith
ensconced
in
safety
behind
the
table
wrung
his
hands
sirs
sirs
take
your
quarrel
into
the
street
i
no
have
fighting
in
my
store
what
did
ye
rin
in
here
for
ye
quaker
baggage
losh
did
ye
ever
see
the
like
of
that
here
boy
ye
can
get
through
the
window
rin
for
the
constable
rin
i
tell
ye
or
there
be
murder
done
a
gentleman
who
had
entered
the
store
unobserved
drew
his
rapier
and
with
it
struck
up
a
heavy
cane
which
was
in
the
act
of
descending
for
the
second
time
upon
the
head
of
the
unlucky
scot
what
is
all
this
he
asked
quietly
five
men
against
one
that
is
hardly
fair
play
ah
i
see
there
were
six
i
had
overlooked
the
gentleman
on
the
floor
who
i
hope
is
only
stunned
five
to
one
the
odds
are
heavy
perhaps
i
can
make
them
less
so
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
he
stepped
backward
a
foot
or
two
until
he
stood
with
the
weaker
side
now
had
it
been
the
constable
who
so
suddenly
appeared
upon
the
scene
the
probabilities
are
that
the
fight
both
sides
having
warmed
to
it
would
despite
the
terrors
of
the
law
have
been
carried
to
a
finish
but
it
was
not
the
constable
it
was
a
gentleman
recently
returned
from
england
and
become
in
the
eyes
of
the
youth
of
williamsburgh
the
glass
of
fashion
and
the
mould
of
form
the
youngster
with
the
shoulder
knots
had
copied
color
and
width
of
ribbon
from
a
suit
which
this
gentleman
had
worn
at
the
palace
the
rake
with
the
wig
awry
who
passed
for
a
wit
had
done
him
the
honor
to
learn
by
heart
portions
of
his
play
and
to
repeat
without
quotation
marks
a
number
of
his
epigrams
while
the
pretty
fellow
whose
cane
he
had
struck
up
practiced
night
and
morning
before
a
mirror
his
bow
and
manner
of
presenting
his
snuffbox
a
fourth
ruffler
desired
office
and
cared
not
to
offend
a
prospective
councilor
there
was
rumor
too
of
a
grand
entertainment
to
be
given
at
fair
view
it
was
good
to
stand
well
with
the
law
but
it
was
imperative
to
do
so
with
marmaduke
haward
their
hands
fell
they
drew
back
a
pace
and
the
wit
made
himself
spokesman
roses
were
rare
so
early
in
the
year
for
him
and
his
companions
they
had
but
wished
to
compliment
those
that
bloomed
in
the
cheeks
of
the
pretty
quakeress
this
servant
fellow
breathing
fire
like
a
dragon
had
taken
it
upon
himself
to
defend
the
roses
which
likely
enough
were
grown
for
him
and
so
had
been
about
to
bring
upon
himself
merited
chastisement
however
since
it
was
marmaduke
haward
who
pleaded
for
him
a
full
stop
a
low
bow
and
a
flourish
will
haward
honor
me
is
right
macouba
and
the
box
if
the
author
of
puppet
show
would
deign
to
accept
it
rather
to
change
with
you
sir
said
the
other
urbanely
and
drew
out
his
own
chased
and
medallioned
box
the
gentleman
upon
the
floor
had
now
gotten
unsteadily
to
his
feet
haward
took
snuff
with
each
of
the
six
asked
after
the
father
of
one
the
brother
of
another
delicately
intimated
his
pleasure
in
finding
the
noble
order
of
mohocks
that
had
lately
died
in
london
resurrected
in
virginia
and
fairly
bowed
the
flattered
youths
out
of
the
store
he
stood
for
a
moment
upon
the
threshold
watching
them
go
triumphantly
if
unsteadily
up
the
street
then
turned
to
the
interior
of
the
store
to
find
maclean
seated
upon
a
stool
with
his
head
against
the
table
submitting
with
a
smile
of
pure
content
to
the
ministrations
of
the
mover
of
the
late
turmoil
who
with
trembling
fingers
was
striving
to
bind
her
kerchief
about
a
great
cut
in
his
forehead
chapter
x
haward
and
evelyn
maclean
put
aside
with
much
gentleness
the
hands
of
his
surgeon
and
rising
to
his
feet
answered
the
question
in
haward
eyes
by
producing
a
slip
of
paper
and
gravely
proffering
it
to
the
man
whom
he
served
haward
took
it
read
it
and
handed
it
back
then
turned
to
the
quaker
maiden
mistress
truelove
taberer
he
said
courteously
are
you
staying
in
town
if
you
will
tell
me
where
you
lodge
i
will
myself
conduct
you
thither
truelove
shook
her
head
and
slipped
her
hand
into
that
of
her
brother
ephraim
i
thank
thee
friend
she
said
with
gentle
dignity
and
thee
too
angus
maclean
though
i
grieve
that
thee
sees
not
that
it
is
not
given
us
to
meet
evil
with
evil
nor
to
withstand
force
with
force
ephraim
and
i
can
now
go
in
peace
i
thank
thee
again
friend
and
thee
she
gave
her
hand
first
to
haward
then
to
maclean
the
former
knowing
the
fashion
of
the
quakers
held
the
small
fingers
a
moment
then
let
them
drop
the
latter
knowing
it
too
raised
them
to
his
lips
and
imprinted
upon
them
an
impassioned
kiss
truelove
blushed
then
frowned
last
of
all
drew
her
hand
away
with
the
final
glimpse
of
her
gray
skirt
the
highlander
came
back
to
the
present
singly
i
could
have
answered
for
them
all
one
after
the
other
he
said
stiffly
together
they
had
the
advantage
i
pay
my
debt
and
give
you
thanks
sir
that
is
an
ugly
cut
across
your
forehead
replied
haward
ker
had
best
bring
you
a
basin
of
water
or
stay
i
am
going
to
my
lodging
come
with
me
and
juba
shall
dress
the
wound
properly
maclean
turned
his
keen
blue
eyes
upon
him
am
i
to
understand
that
you
give
me
a
command
or
that
you
extend
to
me
an
invitation
in
the
latter
case
i
should
prefer
then
take
it
as
a
command
said
haward
imperturbably
i
wish
your
company
ker
i
will
buy
the
piece
of
plate
which
you
showed
me
yesterday
the
two
moved
down
the
room
together
but
at
the
door
maclean
with
his
face
set
like
a
flint
stood
aside
and
haward
passed
out
first
then
waited
for
the
other
to
come
up
with
him
when
i
drink
a
cup
i
drain
it
to
the
dregs
said
the
scot
i
walk
behind
the
man
who
commands
me
the
way
you
see
is
not
broad
enough
for
you
and
me
and
hatred
then
let
hatred
lag
behind
answered
haward
coolly
i
have
negroes
to
walk
at
my
heels
when
i
go
abroad
i
take
you
for
a
gentleman
accept
your
enmity
an
it
please
you
but
protest
against
standing
here
in
the
hot
sunshine
with
a
shrug
maclean
joined
him
as
you
please
he
said
i
have
in
spirit
moved
with
you
through
london
streets
i
never
thought
to
walk
with
you
in
the
flesh
it
was
yet
warm
and
bright
in
the
street
the
dust
thick
the
air
heavy
with
the
odors
of
the
may
haward
and
maclean
walked
in
silence
each
as
to
the
other
one
as
to
the
world
at
large
now
and
again
the
virginian
must
stop
to
bow
profoundly
to
curtsying
ladies
or
to
take
snuff
with
some
portly
councilor
or
less
stately
burgess
who
coming
from
the
capitol
chanced
to
overtake
them
when
he
paused
his
storekeeper
paused
also
but
having
no
notice
taken
of
him
beyond
a
glance
to
discern
his
quality
needed
neither
a
supple
back
nor
a
ready
smile
haward
lodged
upon
palace
street
in
a
square
brick
house
lived
in
by
an
ancient
couple
who
could
remember
puritan
rule
in
virginia
who
had
served
sir
william
berkeley
and
had
witnessed
the
burning
of
jamestown
by
bacon
there
was
a
grassy
yard
to
the
house
and
the
path
to
the
door
lay
through
an
alley
of
lilacs
purple
and
white
the
door
was
open
and
haward
and
maclean
entering
crossed
the
hall
and
going
into
a
large
low
room
into
which
the
late
sunshine
was
streaming
found
the
negro
juba
setting
cakes
and
wine
upon
the
table
this
gentleman
hath
a
broken
head
juba
said
the
master
bring
water
and
linen
and
bind
it
up
for
him
as
he
spoke
he
laid
aside
hat
and
rapier
and
motioned
maclean
to
a
seat
by
the
window
the
latter
obeyed
the
gesture
in
silence
and
in
silence
submitted
to
the
ministrations
of
the
negro
haward
sitting
at
the
table
waited
until
the
wound
had
been
dressed
then
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
dismissed
the
black
you
would
take
nothing
at
my
hands
the
other
day
he
said
to
the
grim
figure
at
the
window
change
your
mind
my
friend
or
my
foe
and
come
sit
and
drink
with
me
maclean
reared
himself
from
his
seat
and
went
stiffly
over
to
the
table
i
have
eaten
and
drunken
with
an
enemy
before
he
said
once
i
met
ewin
mor
mackinnon
upon
a
mountain
side
he
had
oatcake
in
his
sporran
and
i
a
flask
of
usquebaugh
we
couched
in
the
heather
and
ate
and
drank
together
and
then
we
rose
and
fought
i
should
have
slain
him
but
that
a
dozen
mackinnons
came
up
the
glen
and
he
turned
and
fled
to
them
for
cover
here
i
am
in
an
alien
land
a
thousand
fiery
crosses
would
not
bring
one
clansman
to
my
side
i
can
not
fight
my
foe
wherefore
then
should
i
take
favors
at
his
hands
why
should
you
be
my
foe
demanded
haward
look
you
now
there
was
a
time
i
suppose
when
i
was
an
insolent
youngster
like
any
one
of
those
who
lately
set
upon
you
but
now
i
call
myself
a
philosopher
and
man
of
a
world
for
whose
opinions
i
care
not
overmuch
my
coat
is
of
fine
cloth
and
my
shirt
of
holland
your
shirt
is
lockram
and
you
wear
no
coat
at
all
saith
a
world
of
pretty
fellows
we
are
beings
of
separate
planets
the
cloth
is
the
man
is
to
which
doctrine
i
am
at
times
heretic
i
have
some
store
of
yellow
metal
and
spend
my
days
in
ridding
myself
of
it
a
feat
which
you
have
accomplished
a
goodly
number
of
acres
is
also
counted
unto
me
but
in
the
end
my
holding
and
your
holding
will
measure
the
same
i
walk
a
level
road
you
have
met
with
your
precipice
and
bruised
by
the
fall
you
move
along
stony
ways
but
through
the
same
gateway
we
go
at
last
fate
not
i
put
you
here
why
should
you
hate
me
who
am
of
your
order
maclean
left
the
table
and
twice
walked
the
length
of
the
room
slowly
and
with
knitted
brows
if
you
mean
the
order
the
order
of
gentlemen
he
said
coming
to
a
pause
with
the
breadth
of
the
table
between
him
and
haward
we
may
have
that
ground
in
common
the
rest
is
debatable
land
i
do
not
take
you
for
a
sentimentalist
or
a
redresser
of
wrongs
i
am
your
storekeeper
purchased
with
that
same
yellow
metal
of
which
you
so
busily
rid
yourself
and
your
storekeeper
i
shall
remain
until
the
natural
death
of
my
term
two
years
hence
we
are
not
countrymen
we
own
different
kings
i
may
once
have
walked
your
level
road
but
you
have
never
moved
in
the
stony
ways
my
eyes
are
blue
while
yours
are
gray
you
love
your
melting
southern
music
and
i
take
no
joy
save
in
the
pipes
i
dare
swear
you
like
the
smell
of
lilies
which
i
can
not
abide
and
prefer
fair
hair
in
women
where
i
would
choose
the
dark
there
is
no
likeness
between
us
why
then
haward
smiled
and
drawing
two
glasses
toward
him
slowly
filled
them
with
wine
it
is
true
he
said
that
it
is
not
my
intention
to
become
a
petitioner
for
the
pardon
of
a
rebel
to
his
serene
and
german
majesty
the
king
true
also
that
i
like
the
fragrance
of
the
lily
i
have
my
fancies
say
that
i
am
a
man
of
whim
and
that
living
in
a
lonely
house
set
in
a
sahara
of
tobacco
fields
it
is
my
whim
to
desire
the
acquaintance
of
the
only
gentleman
within
some
miles
of
me
say
that
my
fancy
hath
been
caught
by
a
picture
drawn
for
me
a
week
agone
that
being
a
philosopher
i
play
with
the
idea
that
your
spirit
knife
in
hand
walked
at
my
elbow
for
ten
years
and
i
knew
it
not
say
that
the
idea
has
for
me
a
curious
fascination
say
finally
that
i
plume
myself
that
given
the
chance
i
might
break
down
this
airy
hatred
he
set
down
the
bottle
and
pushed
one
of
the
brimming
glasses
across
the
table
i
should
like
to
make
trial
of
my
strength
he
said
with
a
laugh
come
i
did
you
a
service
in
your
turn
do
me
a
pleasure
maclean
dragged
a
chair
to
the
table
and
sat
down
i
will
drink
with
you
he
said
and
forget
for
an
hour
a
man
grows
tired
it
is
burgundy
is
it
not
old
borlum
and
i
emptied
a
bottle
between
us
the
day
he
went
as
hostage
to
wills
since
then
i
have
not
tasted
wine
is
a
pretty
color
haward
lifted
his
glass
i
drink
to
your
future
freedom
better
days
a
stake
in
a
virgin
land
friendship
with
a
sometime
foe
he
bowed
to
his
guest
and
drank
in
my
country
answered
maclean
where
we
would
do
most
honor
we
drink
not
to
life
but
to
death
onarach
like
a
gentleman
may
you
die
he
drank
and
sighed
with
pleasure
the
king
said
haward
there
was
a
china
bowl
filled
with
red
anemones
upon
the
table
maclean
drew
it
toward
him
and
pressing
aside
the
mass
of
bloom
passed
his
glass
over
the
water
in
the
bowl
the
king
with
all
my
heart
he
said
imperturbably
haward
poured
more
wine
i
have
toasted
at
the
many
a
piece
of
brocade
and
lace
less
fair
than
yon
bit
of
quaker
gray
that
cost
you
a
broken
head
shall
we
drink
to
mistress
truelove
taberer
by
now
the
burgundy
had
warmed
the
heart
and
loosened
the
tongue
of
the
man
who
had
not
tasted
wine
since
the
surrender
of
preston
it
is
but
a
mile
from
the
store
to
her
father
house
he
said
sometimes
on
sundays
i
go
up
the
creek
upon
the
fair
view
side
and
when
i
am
over
against
the
house
i
holloa
ephraim
comes
in
his
boat
and
rows
me
across
and
i
stay
for
an
hour
they
are
strange
folk
the
quakers
in
her
sight
and
in
that
of
her
people
i
am
as
good
a
man
as
you
angus
maclean
marmaduke
haward
world
wealth
and
world
rank
quite
beside
the
question
he
drank
and
commended
the
wine
haward
struck
a
silver
bell
and
bade
juba
bring
another
bottle
when
do
you
come
again
to
the
house
at
fair
view
asked
the
storekeeper
very
shortly
it
is
a
lonely
place
where
ghosts
bear
me
company
i
hope
that
now
and
then
when
i
ask
it
and
when
the
duties
of
your
day
are
ended
you
will
come
help
me
exorcise
them
you
shall
find
welcome
and
good
wine
he
spoke
very
courteously
and
if
he
saw
the
humor
of
the
situation
his
smile
betrayed
him
not
maclean
took
a
flower
from
the
bowl
and
plucked
at
its
petals
with
nervous
fingers
do
you
mean
that
he
asked
at
last
haward
leaned
across
the
table
and
their
eyes
met
on
my
word
i
do
said
the
virginian
the
knocker
on
the
house
door
sounded
loudly
and
a
moment
later
a
clear
voice
followed
by
a
man
deeper
tones
was
heard
in
the
hall
more
guests
said
haward
lightly
you
are
a
jacobite
i
drink
my
chocolate
at
james
coffee
house
the
gentleman
approaching
despite
his
friendship
for
orrery
and
for
the
bishop
of
rochester
is
but
a
hanover
tory
but
the
lady
the
lady
wears
only
white
roses
and
every
of
june
makes
a
birthday
feast
the
storekeeper
rose
hastily
to
take
his
leave
but
was
prevented
both
by
haward
restraining
gesture
and
by
the
entrance
of
the
two
visitors
who
were
now
ushered
in
by
the
grinning
juba
haward
stepped
forward
you
are
very
welcome
colonel
evelyn
this
is
kind
your
woman
told
me
this
morning
that
you
were
not
well
else
a
migraine
she
answered
in
her
clear
low
voice
i
am
better
now
and
my
father
desired
me
to
take
the
air
with
him
we
return
to
westover
said
that
sprightly
gentleman
evelyn
is
like
david
of
old
and
pines
for
water
from
the
spring
at
home
it
also
appears
that
the
many
houses
and
thronged
streets
of
this
town
weary
her
who
poor
child
is
used
to
an
arcady
called
london
when
will
you
come
to
us
at
westover
marmaduke
i
can
not
tell
haward
answered
i
must
first
put
my
own
house
in
order
so
that
i
may
in
my
turn
entertain
my
friends
as
he
spoke
he
moved
aside
so
as
to
include
in
the
company
maclean
who
stood
beside
the
table
evelyn
he
said
let
me
make
known
to
you
and
to
you
colonel
a
scots
gentleman
who
hath
broken
his
spear
in
his
tilt
with
fortune
as
hath
been
the
luck
of
many
a
gallant
man
before
him
mistress
evelyn
byrd
colonel
byrd
maclean
who
was
an
officer
in
the
highland
force
taken
at
preston
and
who
has
been
for
some
years
a
prisoner
of
war
in
virginia
the
lady
curtsy
was
low
the
colonel
bowed
as
to
his
friend
friend
if
his
eyebrows
went
up
and
if
a
smile
twitched
the
corners
of
his
lips
the
falling
curls
of
his
periwig
hid
from
view
these
tokens
of
amused
wonder
maclean
bowed
somewhat
stiffly
as
one
grown
rusty
in
such
matters
i
am
in
addition
marmaduke
haward
storekeeper
he
said
succinctly
then
turned
to
the
master
of
fair
view
it
grows
late
he
announced
and
i
must
be
back
at
the
store
have
you
any
message
for
saunderson
none
answered
haward
i
go
myself
to
fair
view
and
then
i
shall
ask
you
to
drink
with
me
again
as
he
spoke
he
held
out
his
hand
maclean
looked
at
it
sighed
then
touched
it
with
his
own
a
gleam
as
of
wintry
laughter
came
into
his
blue
eyes
i
doubt
that
i
shall
have
to
get
me
a
new
foe
he
said
with
regret
in
his
voice
when
he
had
bowed
to
the
lady
and
to
her
father
and
had
gone
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
path
and
through
the
gate
and
when
the
three
at
the
window
had
watched
him
turn
into
duke
of
gloucester
street
the
master
of
westover
looked
at
the
master
of
fair
view
and
burst
out
laughing
ludwell
hath
for
an
overseer
the
scapegrace
younger
son
of
a
baronet
and
there
are
three
brothers
of
an
excellent
name
under
indentures
to
robert
carter
i
have
at
westover
a
gardener
who
annually
makes
the
motto
of
his
house
to
spring
in
pease
and
asparagus
i
have
not
had
him
to
drink
with
me
yet
and
day
i
heard
ludwell
give
to
the
baronet
son
a
hound
rating
i
do
not
drink
with
the
name
said
haward
coolly
i
drink
with
the
man
the
churl
or
coward
may
pass
me
by
but
the
gentleman
though
his
hands
be
empty
i
stop
the
other
laughed
again
then
dismissed
the
question
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
and
pulled
out
a
great
gold
watch
with
cornelian
seals
carter
swears
that
contesse
hath
a
specific
that
is
as
sovereign
for
the
gout
as
is
andrew
cross
for
a
rattlesnake
bite
i
had
twinges
lately
and
the
doctor

hard
by
evelyn
will
you
rest
here
while
i
go
petition

haward
when
i
have
the
recipe
i
will
return
and
impart
it
to
you
against
the
time
when
you
need
it
no
no
child
stay
where
you
are
i
will
be
back
anon
having
waved
aside
his
daughter
faint
protest
the
colonel
departed
a
gallant
figure
of
a
man
with
a
pretty
wit
and
a
heart
that
was
benevolently
gay
as
he
went
down
the
path
he
paused
to
gather
a
sprig
of
lilac
westover
fair
view
he
said
to
himself
and
smiled
and
smelled
the
lilac
then
though
his
ills
were
somewhat
apocryphal
walked
off
at
a
gouty
pace
across
the
green
toward
the
house
of
contesse
haward
and
evelyn
left
alone
kept
silence
for
a
time
in
the
quiet
room
that
was
filled
with
late
sunshine
and
the
fragrance
of
flowers
he
stood
by
the
window
and
she
sat
in
a
great
chair
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
and
her
eyes
upon
them
when
silence
had
become
more
loud
than
speech
she
turned
in
her
seat
and
addressed
herself
to
him
i
have
known
you
do
many
good
deeds
she
said
slowly
that
gentleman
that
was
here
is
your
servant
is
he
not
and
an
exile
and
unhappy
and
you
sent
him
away
comforted
it
was
a
generous
thing
haward
moved
restlessly
a
generous
thing
he
answered
ay
it
was
generous
i
can
do
such
things
at
times
and
why
i
do
them
who
can
tell
not
i
do
you
think
that
i
care
for
that
grim
highlander
who
drinks
my
death
in
place
of
my
health
who
is
of
a
nation
that
i
dislike
and
a
party
that
is
not
mine
she
shook
her
head
i
do
not
know
and
yet
you
helped
him
haward
left
the
window
and
came
and
sat
beside
her
yes
i
helped
him
i
am
not
sure
but
i
think
i
did
it
because
when
first
we
met
he
told
me
that
he
hated
me
and
meant
the
thing
he
said
it
is
my
humor
to
fix
my
own
position
in
men
minds
to
lose
the
thing
i
have
that
i
may
gain
the
thing
i
have
not
to
overcome
and
never
prize
the
victory
to
hunt
down
a
quarry
and
feel
no
ardor
in
the
chase
to
strain
after
a
goal
and
yet
care
not
if
i
never
reach
it
he
took
her
fan
in
his
hand
and
fell
to
counting
the
slender
ivory
sticks
i
tread
the
stage
as
a
fine
gentleman
he
said
it
is
the
part
for
which
i
was
cast
and
i
play
it
well
with
proper
mien
and
gait
i
was
not
asked
if
i
would
like
the
part
but
i
think
that
i
do
like
it
as
much
as
i
like
anything
seeing
that
i
must
play
it
and
that
there
is
that
within
me
which
cries
out
against
slovenliness
i
play
it
as
an
artist
should
magnanimity
goes
with
it
does
it
not
and
generosity
courtesy
care
for
the
thing
which
is
and
not
for
that
which
seems
why
then
with
these
and
other
qualities
i
strive
to
endow
the
character
he
closed
the
fan
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
when
the
lights
are
out
he
said
when
forever
and
a
night
the
actor
bids
the
stage
farewell
when
stripped
of
mask
and
tinsel
he
goes
home
to
that
auditor
who
set
him
his
part
then
perhaps
he
will
be
told
what
manner
of
man
he
is
the
glass
that
now
he
dresses
before
tells
him
not
but
he
thinks
a
truer
glass
would
show
a
shrunken
figure
he
sat
in
silence
for
a
moment
then
laughed
and
gave
her
back
her
fan
am
i
to
come
to
westover
evelyn
he
asked
your
father
presses
and
i
have
not
known
what
answer
to
make
him
you
will
give
us
pleasure
by
your
coming
she
said
gently
and
at
once
my
father
wishes
your
advice
as
to
the
ordering
of
his
library
and
you
know
that
my
pretty
stepmother
likes
you
well
will
it
please
you
to
have
me
come
he
asked
with
his
eyes
upon
her
face
she
met
his
gaze
very
quietly
why
not
she
answered
simply
you
will
help
me
in
my
flower
garden
and
sing
with
me
in
the
evening
as
of
old
evelyn
he
said
if
what
i
am
about
to
say
to
you
distresses
you
lift
your
hand
and
i
will
cease
to
speak
since
a
day
and
an
hour
in
the
woods
yonder
i
have
been
thinking
much
i
wish
to
wipe
that
hour
from
your
memory
as
i
wipe
it
from
mine
and
to
begin
afresh
you
are
the
fairest
woman
that
i
know
and
the
best
i
beg
you
to
accept
my
reverence
homage
love
not
the
boy
love
perhaps
perhaps
not
the
love
that
some
men
have
to
squander
but
love
a
quiet
love
a
lasting
trust
deep
pride
and
pleasure
at
her
gesture
he
broke
off
sat
in
silence
for
a
moment
then
rising
went
to
the
window
and
with
slightly
contracted
brows
stood
looking
out
at
the
sunshine
that
was
slipping
away
presently
he
was
aware
that
she
stood
beside
him
she
was
holding
out
her
hand
it
is
that
of
a
friend
she
said
no
do
not
kiss
it
for
that
is
the
act
of
a
lover
and
you
are
not
my
lover
oh
not
yet
not
yet
a
soft
exquisite
blush
stole
over
her
face
and
neck
but
she
did
not
lower
her
lovely
candid
eyes
perhaps
some
day
some
summer
day
at
westover
it
will
all
be
different
she
breathed
and
turned
away
haward
caught
her
hand
and
bending
pressed
his
lips
upon
it
it
is
different
now
he
cried
next
week
i
shall
come
to
westover
he
led
her
back
to
the
great
chair
and
presently
she
asked
some
question
as
to
the
house
at
fair
view
he
plunged
into
an
account
of
the
cases
of
goods
which
had
followed
him
from
england
by
the
falcon
and
which
now
lay
in
the
rooms
that
were
yet
to
be
swept
and
garnished
then
spoke
lightly
and
whimsically
of
the
solitary
state
in
which
he
must
live
and
of
the
entertainments
which
to
be
in
the
virginia
fashion
he
must
give
while
he
talked
she
sat
and
watched
him
with
the
faint
smile
upon
her
lips
the
sunshine
left
the
floor
and
the
wall
and
a
dankness
from
the
long
grass
and
the
closing
flowers
and
the
heavy
trees
in
the
adjacent
churchyard
stole
into
the
room
with
the
coming
of
the
dusk
conversation
languished
and
the
two
sat
in
silence
until
the
return
of
the
colonel
if
that
gentleman
did
not
light
the
darkness
like
a
star
at
least
his
entrance
into
a
room
invariably
produced
the
effect
of
a
sudden
accession
of
was
lights
very
fine
and
clear
and
bright
he
broke
a
jest
or
two
bade
laughing
farewell
to
the
master
of
fair
view
and
carried
off
his
daughter
upon
his
arm
haward
walked
with
them
to
the
gate
and
came
back
alone
stepping
thoughtfully
between
the
lilac
bushes
it
was
not
until
juba
had
brought
candles
and
he
had
taken
his
seat
at
table
before
the
bottle
of
wine
that
it
came
to
haward
that
he
had
wished
to
tell
evelyn
of
the
brown
girl
who
had
run
for
the
guinea
but
had
forgotten
to
do
so
chapter
xi
audrey
of
the
garden
the
creek
that
ran
between
fairview
and
the
glebe
lands
was
narrow
and
deep
upon
it
moored
to
a
stake
driven
into
a
bit
of
marshy
ground
below
the
orchard
lay
a
crazy
boat
belonging
to
the
minister
to
this
boat
of
an
early
sunny
morning
came
audrey
and
standing
erect
pole
in
hand
pushed
out
from
the
reedy
bank
into
the
stream
it
moved
so
slowly
and
was
so
clear
that
its
depth
seemed
the
blue
depth
of
the
sky
with
now
and
then
a
tranquil
cloud
to
be
glided
over
the
banks
were
low
and
of
the
greenest
grass
save
where
they
sank
still
lower
and
reeds
abounded
or
where
some
colored
bush
heavy
with
bloom
bent
to
meet
its
reflected
image
it
was
so
fair
that
audrey
began
to
sing
as
she
went
down
the
stream
and
without
knowing
why
she
chose
it
she
sang
a
love
song
learned
out
of
one
of
darden
ungodly
books
a
plaintive
and
passionate
lay
addressed
by
some
cavalier
to
his
mistress
of
an
hour
she
sang
not
loudly
but
very
sweetly
carelessly
too
and
as
if
to
herself
now
and
then
repeating
a
line
twice
or
maybe
thrice
pleased
with
the
sweet
melancholy
of
the
notes
but
not
thinking
overmuch
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
they
died
upon
her
lips
when
hugon
rose
from
a
lair
of
reeds
and
called
to
her
to
stop
come
to
the
shore
he
cried
see
i
have
brought
you
a
ribbon
from
the
town
behold
and
he
fluttered
a
crimson
streamer
audrey
caught
her
breath
then
gazed
reassured
at
the
five
yards
of
water
between
her
and
the
bank
had
hugon
stood
there
in
his
hunting
dress
she
would
have
felt
them
no
security
but
he
was
wearing
his
coat
and
breeches
of
fine
cloth
his
ruffled
shirt
and
his
great
black
periwig
a
wetting
would
not
be
to
his
mind
as
she
answered
not
but
went
on
her
way
silent
now
and
with
her
slender
figure
bending
with
the
motion
of
the
pole
he
frowned
and
shrugged
then
took
up
his
pilgrimage
and
with
his
light
and
swinging
stride
kept
alongside
of
the
boat
the
ribbon
lay
across
his
arm
and
he
turned
it
in
the
sunshine
if
you
come
not
and
get
it
he
wheedled
i
will
throw
it
in
the
water
the
angry
tears
sprang
to
audrey
eyes
do
so
and
save
me
the
trouble
she
answered
and
then
was
sorry
that
she
had
spoken
the
red
came
into
the
swarthy
cheeks
of
the
man
upon
the
bank
you
love
me
not
he
said
good
you
have
told
me
so
before
but
here
i
am
then
here
is
a
coward
said
audrey
i
do
not
wish
you
to
walk
there
i
do
not
wish
you
to
speak
to
me
go
back
hugon
teeth
began
to
show
i
go
not
he
answered
with
something
between
a
snarl
and
a
smirk
i
love
you
and
i
follow
on
your
path
like
a
lover
like
an
indian
cried
the
girl
the
arrow
pierced
the
heel
the
face
which
he
turned
upon
her
was
the
face
of
a
savage
made
grotesque
and
horrible
as
and
feathers
could
not
have
made
it
by
the
bushy
black
wig
and
the
lace
cravat
audrey
he
called
morning
light
sunshine
in
the
dark
dancing
water
audrey
that
will
not
be
called
nor
have
the
wooing
of
the
son
of
a
french
chief
then
shall
she
have
the
wooing
of
the
son
of
a
monacan
woman
i
am
a
hunter
i
will
woo
as
they
woo
in
the
woods
audrey
bent
to
her
pole
and
made
faster
progress
down
the
creek
her
heart
was
hot
and
angry
and
yet
she
was
afraid
all
dreadful
things
all
things
that
oppressed
with
horror
all
things
that
turned
one
white
and
cold
so
cold
and
still
that
one
could
not
run
away
were
summed
up
for
her
in
the
word
indian
to
her
the
eyes
of
hugon
were
basilisk
eyes
they
drew
her
and
held
her
and
when
she
looked
into
them
she
saw
flames
rising
and
bodies
of
murdered
kindred
then
the
mountains
loomed
above
her
again
and
it
was
and
she
was
alone
save
for
the
dead
and
mad
with
fear
and
with
the
quiet
the
green
banks
went
by
and
the
creek
began
to
widen
where
are
you
going
called
the
trader
wheresoever
you
go
at
the
end
of
your
path
stand
my
village
and
my
wigwam
you
can
not
stay
all
day
in
that
boat
if
you
come
not
back
at
the
bidden
hour
darden
squaw
will
beat
you
come
over
morning
light
come
over
and
take
me
in
your
boat
and
tie
your
hair
with
my
gift
i
will
not
hurt
you
i
will
tell
you
the
french
love
songs
that
my
father
sang
to
my
mother
i
will
speak
of
land
that
i
have
bought
oh
i
have
prospered
and
of
a
house
that
i
mean
to
build
and
of
a
woman
that
i
wish
to
put
in
the
house
a
sunshine
in
the
dark
to
greet
me
when
i
come
from
my
hunting
in
the
great
forests
beyond
the
falls
from
my
trading
with
the
nation
of
the
tuscaroras
with
the
villages
of
the
monacans
come
over
to
me
morning
light
the
creek
widened
and
widened
then
doubled
a
grassy
cape
all
in
the
shadow
of
a
towering
sycamore
beyond
the
point
crowning
the
low
green
slope
of
the
bank
and
topped
with
a
shaggy
fell
of
honeysuckle
and
ivy
began
a
red
brick
wall
half
way
down
its
length
it
broke
and
six
shallow
steps
led
up
to
an
iron
gate
through
whose
bars
one
looked
into
a
garden
gazing
on
down
the
creek
past
the
farther
stretch
of
the
wall
the
eye
came
upon
the
shining
reaches
of
the
river
audrey
turned
the
boat
head
toward
the
steps
and
the
gate
in
the
wall
the
man
on
the
opposite
shore
let
fall
an
oath
so
you
go
to
fair
view
house
he
called
across
the
stream
there
are
only
negroes
there
unless
he
came
to
a
pause
and
his
face
changed
again
and
out
of
his
eyes
looked
the
spirit
of
some
hot
ancestral
french
lover
cynical
suspicious
and
jealously
watchful
unless
their
master
is
at
home
he
ended
and
laughed
audrey
touched
the
wall
and
over
a
great
iron
hook
projecting
therefrom
threw
a
looped
rope
and
fastened
her
boat
i
stay
here
until
you
come
forth
swore
hugon
from
across
the
creek
and
then
i
follow
you
back
to
where
you
must
moor
the
boat
and
then
i
shall
walk
with
you
to
the
minister
house
until
we
meet
again
audrey
answered
not
but
sped
up
the
steps
to
the
gate
a
sick
fear
lest
it
should
be
locked
possessed
her
but
it
opened
at
her
touch
disclosing
a
long
sunny
path
paved
with
brick
and
shut
between
lines
of
tall
thick
and
smoothly
clipped
box
the
gate
clanged
to
behind
her
ten
steps
and
the
boat
the
creek
and
the
farther
shore
were
hidden
from
her
sight
with
this
comparative
bliss
came
a
faintness
and
a
trembling
that
presently
made
her
slip
down
upon
the
warm
and
sunny
floor
and
lie
there
with
her
face
within
her
arm
and
the
tears
upon
her
cheeks
the
odor
of
the
box
wrapped
her
like
a
mantle
a
lizard
glided
past
her
somewhere
in
open
spaces
birds
were
singing
finally
a
greyhound
came
down
the
path
and
put
its
nose
into
the
hollow
of
her
hand
she
rose
to
her
knees
and
curled
her
arm
around
the
dog
neck
then
with
a
long
sigh
stood
up
and
asked
of
herself
if
this
were
the
way
to
the
house
she
had
never
seen
the
house
at
close
range
had
never
been
in
this
walled
garden
it
was
from
williamsburgh
that
the
minister
had
taken
her
to
his
home
eleven
years
before
sometimes
from
the
river
in
those
years
she
had
seen
rising
above
the
trees
the
steep
roof
and
the
upper
windows
sometimes
upon
the
creek
she
had
gone
past
the
garden
wall
and
had
smelled
the
flowers
upon
the
other
side
in
her
lonely
life
with
the
beauty
of
the
earth
about
her
to
teach
her
that
there
might
be
greater
beauty
that
she
yet
might
see
with
a
daily
round
of
toil
and
sharp
words
to
push
her
to
that
escape
which
lay
in
a
world
of
dreams
she
had
entered
that
world
and
thrived
therein
it
was
a
world
that
was
as
pure
as
a
pearl
and
more
fantastic
than
an
arabian
tale
she
knew
that
when
she
died
she
could
take
nothing
out
of
life
with
her
to
heaven
but
with
this
other
world
it
was
different
and
all
that
she
had
or
dreamed
of
that
was
fair
she
carried
through
its
portals
this
house
was
there
long
closed
walled
in
guarded
by
tall
trees
seen
at
far
intervals
and
from
a
distance
as
through
a
glass
darkly
it
had
become
to
her
an
enchanted
spot
about
which
played
her
quick
fancy
but
where
her
feet
might
never
stray
but
now
the
spell
which
had
held
the
place
in
slumber
was
snapped
and
her
feet
was
set
in
its
pleasant
paths
she
moved
down
the
alley
between
the
lines
of
box
and
the
greyhound
went
with
her
the
branches
of
a
drooped
heavily
across
the
way
when
she
had
passed
them
she
saw
the
house
square
dull
red
bathed
in
sunshine
a
moment
and
the
walk
led
her
between
squat
pillars
of
living
green
into
the
garden
out
of
the
fairy
tale
dim
fragrant
and
old
time
walled
in
here
sunshiny
spaces
there
cool
shadows
of
broken
by
circles
and
squares
of
box
green
with
the
grass
and
the
leaves
red
and
purple
and
gold
and
white
with
the
flowers
with
birds
singing
with
the
great
silver
river
murmuring
by
without
the
wall
at
the
foot
of
the
terrace
with
the
voice
of
a
man
who
sat
beneath
a
reading
aloud
to
himself
such
was
the
garden
that
she
came
upon
a
young
girl
and
heavy
at
heart
she
was
so
near
that
she
could
hear
the
words
of
the
reader
and
she
knew
the
piece
that
he
was
reading
for
you
must
remember
that
she
was
not
untaught
and
that
darden
had
books
from
the
censer
clouds
of
fragrance
roll
and
swelling
organs
lift
the
rising
soul
one
thought
of
thee
puts
all
the
pomp
to
flight
priests
tapers
temples
swim
before
my
sight
the
greyhound
ran
from
audrey
to
the
man
who
was
reading
these
verses
with
taste
and
expression
and
also
with
a
smile
half
sad
and
half
cynical
he
glanced
from
his
page
saw
the
girl
where
she
stood
against
the
dark
pillar
of
the
box
tossed
aside
the
book
and
went
to
her
down
the
grassy
path
between
rows
of
nodding
tulips
why
child
he
said
did
you
come
up
like
a
flower
i
am
glad
to
see
you
in
my
garden
little
maid
are
there
indians
without
at
least
to
audrey
there
were
none
within
she
had
been
angered
sick
at
heart
and
sore
afraid
but
she
was
no
longer
so
in
this
world
that
she
had
entered
it
was
good
to
be
alive
she
knew
that
she
was
safe
and
of
a
sudden
she
felt
that
the
sunshine
was
very
golden
the
music
very
sweet
to
haward
looking
at
her
with
a
smile
she
gave
a
folded
paper
which
she
drew
from
the
bosom
of
her
gown
the
minister
sent
me
with
it
she
explained
and
curtsied
shyly
haward
took
the
paper
opened
it
and
fell
to
poring
over
the
crabbed
characters
with
which
it
was
adorned
ay
gratulateth
himself
that
this
fortunate
parish
hath
at
last
for
vestryman
marmaduke
haward
knoweth
that
seeing
i
am
what
i
am
my
influence
will
be
paramount
with
said
vestry
commendeth
himself
to
my
favor
beggeth
that
i
listen
not
to
charges
made
by
a
factious
member
anent
a
vastly
magnified
occurrence
at
the
french
ordinary
prayeth
that
he
may
shortly
present
himself
at
fair
view
and
explain
away
certain
calumnies
with
which
his
enemies
have
poisoned
the
ears
of
the
commissary
hopeth
that
i
am
in
good
health
and
is
my
very
obedient
servant
to
command
humph
he
let
the
paper
flutter
to
the
ground
and
turned
to
audrey
with
a
kindly
smile
i
am
much
afraid
that
this
man
of
the
church
whom
i
gave
thee
for
guardian
child
is
but
a
rascal
after
all
and
a
wolf
in
sheep
clothing
but
let
him
go
hang
while
i
show
you
my
garden
going
closer
he
glanced
at
her
keenly
then
went
nearer
still
and
touched
her
cheek
with
his
forefinger
you
have
been
crying
he
said
there
indians
then
how
many
and
how
strong
audrey
the
dark
eyes
that
met
his
were
the
eyes
of
the
child
who
in
the
darkness
through
the
corn
had
run
from
him
her
helper
there
was
one
she
whispered
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
haward
drew
her
to
the
seat
beneath
the
and
there
while
he
sat
beside
her
elbow
on
knee
and
chin
on
hand
watching
her
she
told
him
of
hugon
it
was
so
natural
to
tell
him
when
she
had
made
an
end
of
her
halting
broken
sentences
and
he
spoke
to
her
gravely
and
kindly
she
hung
upon
his
words
and
thought
him
wise
and
wonderful
as
a
king
he
told
her
that
he
would
speak
to
darden
and
did
not
despair
of
persuading
that
worthy
to
forbid
the
trader
his
house
also
he
told
her
that
in
this
settled
pleasant
virginia
and
in
the
eighteenth
century
a
maid
however
poor
and
humble
might
not
be
married
against
her
will
if
this
had
threats
to
utter
there
was
always
the
law
of
the
land
a
few
hours
in
the
pillory
or
a
taste
of
the
sheriff
whip
might
not
be
amiss
finally
if
the
trader
made
his
suit
again
audrey
must
let
him
know
and
monsieur
jean
hugon
should
be
taught
that
he
had
another
than
a
helpless
friendless
girl
to
deal
with
audrey
listened
and
was
comforted
but
the
shadow
did
not
quite
leave
her
eyes
he
is
waiting
for
me
now
she
said
fearfully
to
haward
who
had
not
missed
the
shadow
he
followed
me
down
the
creek
and
is
waiting
over
against
the
gate
in
the
wall
when
i
go
back
he
will
follow
me
again
and
at
last
i
will
have
to
cross
to
his
side
and
then
he
will
go
home
with
me
and
make
me
listen
to
him
his
eyes
burn
me
and
when
his
hand
touches
me
i
see
i
see
her
frame
shook
and
she
raised
to
his
gaze
a
countenance
suddenly
changed
into
tragedy
own
i
do
know
why
she
said
in
a
stricken
voice
but
of
them
all
that
i
kissed
that
night
i
now
see
only
molly
i
suppose
she
was
about
as
old
as
i
am
when
they
killed
her
we
were
always
together
i
ca
remember
her
face
very
clearly
only
her
eyes
and
how
red
her
lips
were
and
her
hair
it
came
to
her
knees
and
mine
is
just
as
long
for
a
long
long
time
after
you
went
away
when
i
could
not
sleep
because
it
was
dark
or
when
i
was
frightened
or
mistress
deborah
beat
me
i
saw
them
all
but
now
i
see
only
molly
molly
lying
there
there
was
a
silence
in
the
garden
broken
presently
by
haward
ay
molly
he
said
absently
with
his
hand
covering
his
lips
and
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
he
fell
into
a
brown
study
audrey
sat
very
still
for
fear
that
she
might
disturb
him
who
was
so
kind
to
her
a
passionate
gratitude
filled
her
young
heart
she
would
have
traveled
round
the
world
upon
her
knees
to
serve
him
as
for
him
he
was
not
thinking
of
the
mountain
girl
the
oread
who
in
the
days
when
he
was
younger
and
his
heart
beat
high
had
caught
his
light
fancy
tempting
him
from
his
comrades
back
to
the
cabin
in
the
valley
to
look
again
into
her
eyes
and
touch
the
brown
waves
of
her
hair
she
was
ashes
and
the
memory
of
her
stirred
him
not
at
last
he
looked
up
i
myself
will
take
you
home
child
this
fellow
shall
not
come
near
you
and
cease
to
think
of
these
gruesome
things
that
happened
long
ago
you
are
young
and
fair
you
should
be
happy
i
will
see
to
it
that
he
broke
off
and
again
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
ground
the
book
which
he
had
tossed
aside
was
lying
upon
the
grass
open
at
the
poem
which
he
had
been
reading
he
stooped
and
raised
the
volume
and
closing
it
laid
it
upon
the
bench
beside
her
presently
he
laughed
come
child
he
said
you
have
youth
i
begin
to
think
my
own
not
past
recall
come
and
let
me
show
you
my
dial
that
i
have
just
had
put
up
there
was
no
load
at
audrey
heart
the
vision
of
molly
had
passed
the
fear
of
hugon
was
a
dwindling
cloud
she
was
safe
in
this
old
sunny
garden
with
harm
shut
without
and
as
a
flower
opens
to
the
sunshine
so
because
she
was
happy
she
grew
more
fair
audrey
every
day
audrey
of
the
infrequent
speech
and
the
wide
dark
eyes
the
startled
air
the
shy
fugitive
smiles
that
was
not
audrey
of
the
garden
audrey
of
the
garden
had
shining
eyes
a
wild
elusive
grace
laughter
as
silvery
as
that
which
had
rung
from
her
sister
lips
years
agone
beneath
the
in
the
blue
mountains
quick
gestures
quaint
fancies
which
she
feared
not
to
speak
out
the
charm
of
mingled
humility
and
spirit
enough
in
short
to
make
audrey
of
the
garden
a
name
to
conjure
with
they
came
to
the
and
leaned
thereon
around
its
rim
were
graved
two
lines
from
herrick
and
audrey
traced
the
letters
with
her
finger
the
philosophy
is
sound
remarked
haward
and
the
advice
worth
the
taking
let
us
go
see
if
there
are
any
rosebuds
to
gather
from
the
bushes
yonder
damask
buds
should
look
well
against
your
hair
child
when
they
came
to
the
rosebushes
he
broke
for
her
a
few
buds
and
himself
fastened
them
in
the
coils
of
her
hair
innocent
and
glad
as
she
was
glad
even
that
he
thought
her
fair
she
trembled
beneath
his
touch
and
knew
not
why
she
trembled
when
the
rosebuds
were
in
place
they
went
to
see
the
clove
pinks
and
when
they
had
seen
the
clove
pinks
they
walked
slowly
up
another
alley
of
box
and
across
a
grass
plot
to
a
side
door
of
the
house
for
he
had
said
that
he
must
show
her
in
what
great
lonely
rooms
he
lived
audrey
measured
the
height
and
breadth
of
the
house
with
her
eyes
it
is
a
large
place
for
one
to
live
in
alone
she
said
and
laughed
there
a
book
at
the
widow
constance
barbara
once
showed
it
to
me
it
is
all
about
a
pilgrim
and
there
a
picture
of
a
great
square
house
quite
like
this
that
was
a
giant
castle
giant
despair
good
giant
eat
me
not
child
woman
spirit
of
the
woodland
she
passed
before
him
into
a
dim
cool
room
all
littered
with
books
my
library
said
haward
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
but
the
curtains
and
pictures
are
not
hung
nor
the
books
in
place
hast
any
schooling
little
maid
canst
read
audrey
flushed
with
pride
that
she
could
tell
him
that
she
was
not
ignorant
not
like
barbara
who
could
not
read
the
giant
name
in
the
pilgrim
book
the
crossroads
schoolmaster
taught
me
she
explained
he
has
a
scar
in
each
hand
and
is
a
very
wicked
man
but
he
knows
more
than
the
commissary
himself
the
minister
too
has
a
cupboard
filled
with
books
and
he
buys
the
new
ones
as
the
ships
bring
them
in
when
i
have
time
and
mistress
deborah
will
not
let
me
go
to
the
woods
i
read
and
i
remember
what
i
read
i
could
a
smile
trembled
upon
her
lips
and
her
eyes
grew
brighter
fired
by
the
desire
that
he
should
praise
her
learning
and
in
her
very
innocence
bold
as
a
wortley
or
a
howe
she
began
to
repeat
the
lines
which
he
had
been
reading
beneath
the
from
the
censer
clouds
of
fragrance
roll
the
rhythm
of
the
words
the
passion
of
the
thought
the
pleased
surprise
that
she
thought
she
read
in
his
face
the
gesture
of
his
hand
all
spurred
her
on
from
line
to
line
sentence
to
sentence
and
now
she
was
not
herself
but
that
other
woman
and
she
was
giving
voice
to
all
her
passion
all
her
woe
the
room
became
a
convent
cell
her
ragged
dress
the
penitent
trailing
black
that
audrey
lithe
of
mind
as
of
body
who
in
the
woods
seemed
the
spirit
of
the
woods
in
the
garden
the
spirit
of
the
garden
on
the
water
the
spirit
of
the
water
that
this
audrey
in
using
the
speech
of
the
poet
should
embody
and
become
the
spirit
of
that
speech
was
perhaps
considering
all
things
not
so
strange
at
any
rate
and
however
her
power
came
about
at
that
moment
in
fair
view
house
a
great
actress
was
speaking
blooming
hope
gay
daughter
of
the
skies
and
faith
the
speaker
lost
a
word
hesitated
became
confused
finally
silence
then
the
audrey
of
a
while
before
standing
with
heaving
bosom
shy
as
a
fawn
fearful
that
she
had
not
pleased
him
after
all
for
if
she
had
done
so
surely
he
would
have
told
her
as
much
as
it
was
he
had
said
but
one
word
and
that
beneath
his
breath
it
would
seem
that
her
fear
was
unfounded
for
when
he
did
speak
there
were
god
wot
enough
and
audrey
who
in
her
workaday
world
was
always
blamed
could
not
know
that
the
praise
that
was
so
sweet
was
less
wholesome
than
the
blame
leaving
the
library
they
went
into
the
hall
and
from
the
hall
looked
into
great
echoing
rooms
all
about
lay
many
of
them
open
with
rich
stuffs
streaming
from
them
ornaments
were
huddled
on
tables
mirrors
and
pictures
leaned
their
faces
to
the
walls
everywhere
was
disorder
the
negroes
are
careless
and
i
held
their
hands
said
haward
i
must
get
some
proper
person
to
see
to
this
gear
up
stairs
and
down
they
went
through
the
house
that
seemed
very
large
and
very
still
and
finally
they
came
out
of
the
great
front
door
and
down
the
stone
steps
on
to
the
terrace
below
them
sparkling
in
the
sunshine
lay
the
river
the
opposite
shore
all
in
a
haze
of
light
i
must
go
home
audrey
shyly
reminded
him
whereat
he
smiled
assent
and
they
went
not
through
the
box
alley
to
the
gate
in
the
wall
but
down
the
terrace
and
out
upon
the
hot
brown
boards
of
the
landing
haward
stepping
into
a
boat
handed
her
to
a
seat
in
the
stern
and
himself
took
the
oars
leaving
the
landing
they
came
to
the
creek
and
entered
it
presently
they
were
gliding
beneath
the
red
brick
wall
with
the
honeysuckle
atop
on
the
opposite
grassy
shore
seated
in
a
blaze
of
noon
sunshine
was
hugon
they
in
the
boat
took
no
notice
haward
rowing
spoke
evenly
on
his
theme
himself
and
the
gay
and
lonely
life
he
had
led
these
eleven
years
and
audrey
though
at
first
sight
of
the
waiting
figure
she
had
paled
and
trembled
was
too
safe
too
happy
to
give
to
trouble
any
part
of
this
magic
morning
she
kept
her
eyes
on
haward
face
and
almost
forgot
the
man
who
had
risen
from
the
grass
and
in
silence
was
following
them
now
had
the
trader
in
his
hunting
shirt
and
leggings
his
moccasins
and
fur
cap
been
walking
in
the
great
woods
this
silence
even
with
others
in
company
would
have
been
natural
enough
to
his
indian
blood
but
monsieur
jean
hugon
in
peruke
and
laced
coat
walking
in
a
civilized
country
with
words
and
as
hot
as
in
his
heart
and
none
upon
his
tongue
was
a
figure
strange
and
sinister
he
watched
the
two
in
the
boat
with
an
impassive
face
and
he
walked
like
an
indian
on
an
enemy
trail
so
silently
that
he
scarce
seemed
to
breathe
so
lightly
that
his
heavy
boots
failed
to
crush
the
flowers
or
the
tender
grass
haward
rowed
on
telling
audrey
stories
of
the
town
of
great
men
whose
names
she
knew
and
beautiful
ladies
of
whom
she
had
never
heard
and
she
sat
before
him
with
her
slim
brown
hands
folded
in
her
lap
and
the
rosebuds
withering
in
her
hair
while
through
the
reeds
and
the
grass
and
the
bushes
of
the
bank
over
against
them
strode
hugon
in
his
blenheim
wig
and
his
coat
together
the
three
reached
the
stake
driven
in
among
the
reeds
a
hundred
yards
below
the
minister
house
haward
fastened
the
boat
and
motioning
to
audrey
to
stay
for
the
moment
where
she
was
stepped
out
upon
the
bank
to
confront
the
trader
who
walking
steadily
and
silently
as
ever
was
almost
upon
them
but
it
was
broad
daylight
and
hugon
with
his
forest
instincts
preferred
when
he
wished
to
speak
to
the
point
to
speak
in
the
dark
he
made
no
pause
only
looked
with
his
fierce
black
eyes
at
the
quiet
insouciant
fine
gentleman
standing
with
folded
arms
between
him
and
the
boat
then
passed
on
going
steadily
up
the
creek
toward
the
bend
where
the
water
left
the
open
smiling
fields
and
took
to
the
forest
he
never
looked
back
but
went
like
a
hunter
with
his
prey
before
him
presently
the
shadows
of
the
forest
touched
him
and
audrey
and
haward
were
left
alone
the
latter
laughed
if
his
courage
is
of
the
quality
of
his
lace
what
cowering
child
and
the
tears
in
your
eyes
you
were
braver
when
you
were
not
so
tall
in
those
mountain
days
nay
no
need
to
wet
your
shoe
he
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
set
her
feet
upon
firm
grass
how
long
since
i
carried
you
across
a
stream
and
up
a
dark
hillside
he
said
and
yet
it
seems
but
yesternight
now
little
maid
the
indian
has
run
away
and
the
path
to
the
house
is
clear
in
his
untidy
best
room
darden
sat
at
table
his
drink
beside
him
his
pipe
between
his
fingers
and
open
before
him
a
book
of
jests
propped
by
a
tome
of
divinity
his
wife
coming
in
from
the
kitchen
he
burrowed
in
the
litter
upon
the
table
until
he
found
an
open
letter
which
he
flung
toward
her
the
commissary
threatens
again
damn
him
he
said
between
smoke
puffs
it
seems
that
night
when
i
was
in
my
cups
at
the
tavern
le
neve
and
the
fellow
who
has
ware
creek
parish

good
kind
gentlemen

on
to
williamsburgh
on
a
errand

that
child
never
coming
back
deborah
she
coming
now
answered
his
wife
with
her
eyes
upon
the
letter
i
was
watching
from
the
upper
window
he
rowed
her
up
the
creek
himself
the
door
opened
and
audrey
entered
the
room
darden
turned
heavily
in
his
chair
and
took
the
long
pipe
from
between
his
teeth
well
he
said
you
gave
him
my
letter
audrey
nodded
her
eyes
were
dreamy
the
red
of
the
buds
in
her
hair
had
somehow
stolen
to
her
cheeks
she
could
scarce
keep
her
lips
from
smiling
he
bade
me
tell
you
to
come
to
supper
with
him
on
monday
she
said
and
the
falcon
that
we
saw
come
in
last
week
brought
furnishing
for
the
great
house
oh
mistress
deborah
the
most
beautiful
things
the
rooms
are
all
to
be
made
fine
and
the
negro
women
do
not
the
work
aright
and
he
wants
some
one
to
oversee
them
he
says
that
he
has
learned
that
in
england
mistress
deborah
was
own
woman
to
my
lady
squander
and
so
should
know
about
hangings
and
china
and
the
placing
of
furniture
and
he
asks
that
she
come
to
fair
view
morning
after
morning
until
the
house
is
in
order
he
wishes
me
to
come
too
mistress
deborah
will
much
oblige
him
he
says
and
he
will
not
forget
her
kindness
somewhat
out
of
breath
but
very
happy
she
looked
with
eager
eyes
from
one
guardian
to
the
other
darden
emptied
and
refilled
his
pipe
scattering
the
ashes
upon
the
book
of
jests
very
good
he
said
briefly
into
the
thin
visage
of
the
who
had
been
happier
at
my
lady
squander
than
in
a
virginia
parsonage
there
crept
a
tightened
smile
in
her
way
when
she
was
not
in
a
passion
she
was
fond
of
audrey
but
in
temper
or
out
of
temper
she
was
fonder
of
the
fine
things
which
for
a
few
days
she
might
handle
at
fair
view
house
and
the
gratitude
of
the
master
thereof
might
appear
in
coins
or
in
an
order
on
his
store
for
silk
and
lace
when
in
her
younger
days
at
bath
or
in
town
she
had
served
fine
mistresses
she
had
been
given
many
a
guinea
for
carrying
a
note
or
contriving
an
interview
and
in
changing
her
estate
she
had
not
changed
her
code
of
morals
we
must
oblige
haward
of
course
she
said
complacently
i
warrant
you
that
i
can
give
things
an
air
not
a
parlor
in
this
parish
that
does
not
set
my
teeth
on
edge
now
at
my
lady
squander
she
embarked
upon
reminiscences
of
past
splendor
checked
only
by
her
husband
impatient
demand
for
dinner
audrey
preparing
to
follow
her
into
the
kitchen
was
stopped
as
she
would
have
passed
the
table
by
the
minister
heavy
hand
the
roses
at
fair
view
bloom
early
he
said
turning
her
about
that
he
might
better
see
the
red
cluster
in
her
hair
look
you
audrey
i
wish
you
no
great
harm
child
you
mind
me
at
times
of
one
that
i
knew
many
years
ago
before
ever
i
was
chaplain
to
my
lord
squander
or
husband
to
my
lady
squander
a
hunter
may
use
a
decoy
and
he
may
also
on
the
whole
prefer
to
keep
that
decoy
as
good
as
when
was
made
buy
not
thy
roses
too
dearly
audrey
to
audrey
he
spoke
in
riddles
she
took
from
her
hair
the
loosened
buds
and
looked
at
them
lying
in
her
hand
i
did
not
buy
them
she
said
they
grew
in
the
sun
on
the
south
side
of
the
great
house
and
haward
gave
them
to
me
chapter
xii
the
portrait
of
a
gentleman
june
came
to
virginia
with
long
warm
days
and
with
the
odor
of
many
roses
day
by
day
the
cloudless
sunshine
visited
the
land
night
by
night
the
large
pale
stars
looked
into
its
waters
it
was
a
slumberous
land
of
many
creeks
and
rivers
that
were
wide
slow
and
deep
of
tobacco
fields
and
lofty
solemn
forests
of
vague
marshes
of
white
mists
of
a
haze
of
heat
far
and
near
the
moon
of
blossoms
was
past
and
the
red
men
few
in
number
now
had
returned
from
their
hunting
and
lay
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
in
the
villages
that
the
english
had
left
them
while
the
women
brought
them
fish
from
the
weirs
and
strawberries
from
the
vines
that
carpeted
every
poisoned
field
or
neglected
clearing
the
black
men
toiled
amidst
the
tobacco
and
the
maize
at
noontide
it
was
as
hot
in
the
fields
as
in
the
middle
passage
and
the
voices
of
those
who
sang
over
their
work
fell
to
a
dull
crooning
the
white
men
who
were
bound
served
listlessly
they
that
were
well
were
as
lazy
as
the
weather
they
that
were
newly
come
over
and
ill
with
the
seasoning
fever
tossed
upon
their
pallets
longing
for
the
cooling
waters
of
home
the
white
men
who
were
free
swore
that
the
world
though
fair
was
warm
and
none
walked
if
he
could
ride
the
sunny
dusty
roads
were
left
for
shadowed
bridle
paths
in
a
land
where
most
places
could
be
reached
by
boat
the
water
would
have
been
the
highway
but
that
the
languid
air
would
not
fill
the
sails
it
was
agreed
that
the
heat
was
unnatural
and
that
likely
enough
there
would
be
a
deal
of
fever
during
the
summer
but
there
was
thick
shade
in
the
fair
view
garden
and
when
there
was
air
at
all
it
visited
the
terrace
above
the
river
the
rooms
of
the
house
were
large
and
draw
to
the
shutters
and
they
became
as
cool
as
caverns
around
the
place
the
heat
lay
in
wait
heat
of
wide
shadowless
fields
where
haward
slaves
toiled
from
morn
to
eve
heat
of
the
great
river
unstirred
by
any
wind
hot
and
sleeping
beneath
the
blazing
sun
heat
of
sluggish
creeks
and
of
the
marshes
shadeless
as
the
fields
once
reach
the
mighty
trees
drawn
like
a
cordon
around
house
and
garden
and
there
was
escape
to
and
fro
and
up
and
down
in
the
house
went
the
erst
to
my
lady
squander
carrying
matters
with
a
high
hand
the
negresses
who
worked
under
her
eye
found
her
a
hard
taskmistress
was
a
room
clean
it
was
found
that
there
was
dust
upon
the
polished
floor
finger
marks
on
the
paneled
walls
the
same
furniture
must
be
placed
now
in
this
room
now
in
that
china
slowly
washed
and
bestowed
in
one
closet
transferred
to
another
an
eternity
spent
upon
the
household
linen
another
on
the
sewing
and
resewing
the
hanging
and
rehanging
of
damask
curtains
the
slaves
silent
when
the
greenish
eyes
and
tight
vixenish
face
were
by
chattered
laughed
and
sung
when
they
were
left
alone
if
they
fell
idle
and
little
was
done
of
a
morning
they
went
unrebuked
thoroughness
and
not
haste
appearing
to
be
mistress
deborah
motto
the
master
of
fair
view
found
it
too
noisy
in
his
house
to
sit
therein
and
too
warm
to
ride
abroad
there
were
left
the
seat
built
round
the
in
the
garden
the
long
cool
box
walk
and
the
terrace
with
a
at
either
end
it
was
pleasant
to
read
out
of
doors
pacing
the
box
walk
or
sitting
beneath
the
with
the
ripening
fruit
overhead
if
the
book
was
long
in
reading
if
morning
by
morning
finger
slipped
easily
in
between
the
selfsame
leaves
perhaps
it
was
the
fault
of
poet
or
philosopher
if
audrey
was
the
fault
she
knew
it
not
how
could
she
know
it
who
knew
herself
that
she
was
a
poor
humble
maid
whom
out
of
pure
charity
and
knightly
tenderness
for
weak
and
sorrowful
things
he
long
ago
had
saved
since
then
had
maintained
now
was
kind
to
and
knew
him
that
he
was
learned
and
great
and
good
the
very
perfect
gentle
knight
who
as
he
rode
to
win
the
princess
yet
could
stoop
from
his
saddle
to
raise
and
help
the
herd
girl
she
had
found
of
late
that
she
was
often
wakeful
of
nights
when
this
happened
she
lay
and
looked
out
of
her
window
at
the
stars
and
wondered
about
the
princess
she
was
sure
that
the
princess
and
the
lady
who
had
given
her
the
guinea
were
one
in
the
great
house
she
would
have
worked
her
fingers
to
the
bone
her
strong
young
arms
lifted
heavy
weights
her
quick
feet
ran
up
and
down
stairs
for
this
or
that
she
would
have
taken
the
waxed
cloths
from
the
negroes
and
upon
her
knees
and
with
willing
hands
have
made
to
shine
like
mirrors
the
floors
that
were
to
be
trodden
by
knight
and
princess
but
almost
every
morning
before
she
had
worked
an
hour
haward
would
call
to
her
from
the
box
walk
or
the
seat
beneath
the
and
go
child
would
say
mistress
deborah
looking
up
from
her
task
of
the
moment
the
garden
continued
to
be
the
enchanted
garden
to
gather
its
flowers
red
and
white
to
pace
with
him
cool
paved
walks
between
walls
of
scented
box
to
sit
beside
him
beneath
the
or
upon
the
grassy
terrace
looking
out
upon
the
wide
idle
river
it
was
dreamy
bliss
a
happiness
too
rare
to
last
there
was
no
harm
not
that
she
ever
dreamed
there
could
be
the
house
overlooked
garden
and
terrace
the
slaves
passed
and
repassed
the
open
windows
juba
came
and
went
now
and
then
mistress
deborah
herself
would
sally
forth
to
receive
instructions
concerning
this
or
that
from
the
master
of
the
house
and
every
day
at
noon
the
slaves
drew
to
all
the
shutters
save
those
of
the
master
room
and
the
minister
wife
and
ward
made
their
curtsies
and
went
home
the
latter
like
a
child
counted
the
hours
upon
the
clock
until
the
next
morning
but
then
she
was
not
used
to
happiness
and
the
wine
of
it
made
her
slightly
drunken
the
master
of
fair
view
told
himself
that
there
was
infection
in
this
lotus
air
of
virginia
a
fever
ran
in
his
veins
that
made
him
languid
of
will
somewhat
sluggish
of
thought
willing
to
spend
one
day
like
another
and
all
in
a
long
dream
sometimes
in
the
afternoons
when
he
was
alone
in
the
garden
or
upon
the
terrace
with
the
house
blank
and
silent
behind
him
the
slaves
gone
to
the
quarters
he
tossed
aside
his
book
and
with
his
chin
upon
his
hand
and
his
eyes
upon
the
sweep
of
the
river
first
asked
himself
whither
he
was
going
and
then
finding
no
satisfactory
answer
fell
to
brooding
once
going
into
the
house
he
chanced
to
come
upon
his
reflection
in
a
mirror
newly
hung
and
stopped
short
to
gaze
upon
himself
the
parlor
of
his
lodgings
at
williamsburgh
and
the
last
time
that
he
had
seen
evelyn
came
to
him
conjured
up
by
the
memory
of
certain
words
of
his
own
a
truer
glass
might
show
a
shrunken
figure
he
repeated
and
with
a
quick
and
impatient
sigh
he
looked
at
the
image
in
the
mirror
to
the
eye
at
least
the
figure
was
not
shrunken
it
was
that
of
a
man
still
young
and
of
a
handsome
face
and
much
distinction
of
bearing
the
dress
was
perfect
in
its
quiet
elegance
the
air
of
the
man
composed
a
trifle
sad
a
trifle
mocking
haward
snapped
his
fingers
at
the
reflection
the
portrait
of
a
gentleman
he
said
and
passed
on
that
night
in
his
own
room
he
took
from
an
escritoire
a
picture
of
evelyn
byrd
done
in
miniature
after
a
painting
by
a
pupil
of
kneller
and
carrying
it
over
to
the
light
of
the
myrtle
candles
upon
the
table
sat
down
and
fell
to
studying
it
after
a
while
he
let
it
drop
from
his
hand
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
thinking
the
night
air
rising
slightly
bent
back
the
flame
of
the
candles
around
which
moths
were
fluttering
and
caused
strange
shadows
upon
the
walls
they
were
thick
about
the
curtained
bed
whereon
had
died
the
elder
haward
a
proud
man
choleric
and
hard
to
turn
from
his
purposes
into
the
mind
of
his
son
sitting
staring
at
these
shadows
came
the
fantastic
notion
that
amongst
them
angry
and
struggling
vainly
for
speech
might
be
his
father
shade
the
night
was
feverish
of
a
heat
and
lassitude
to
foster
grotesque
and
idle
fancies
haward
smiled
and
spoke
aloud
to
his
imaginary
ghost
you
need
not
strive
for
speech
he
said
i
know
what
you
would
say
it
for
this
i
built
this
house
bought
land
and
slaves
fair
view
and
westover
westover
and
fair
view
a
lady
that
will
not
wed
thee
because
she
loves
thee
zoons
marmaduke
thou
puttest
me
beside
my
patience
as
for
this
other
set
no
nameless
barefoot
wench
where
sat
thy
mother
king
cophetua
and
the
beggar
maid
indeed
i
warrant
you
cophetua
was
something
under
haward
ceased
to
speak
for
his
father
and
sighed
for
himself
moral
must
be
wiser
in
his
day
and
generation
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
began
to
walk
the
room
if
not
cophetua
what
then
what
then
passing
the
table
he
took
up
the
miniature
again
the
villain
of
the
piece
i
suppose
evelyn
he
asked
the
pure
and
pensive
face
seemed
to
answer
him
he
put
the
picture
hastily
down
and
recommenced
his
pacing
to
and
fro
from
the
garden
below
came
the
heavy
odor
of
lilies
and
the
whisper
of
the
river
tried
the
nerves
haward
went
to
the
window
and
leaning
out
looked
as
now
each
night
he
looked
up
and
across
the
creek
toward
the
minister
house
there
was
no
light
to
mark
it
it
was
late
and
all
the
world
without
his
room
was
in
darkness
he
sat
down
in
the
window
seat
looked
out
upon
the
stars
and
listened
to
the
river
an
hour
had
passed
before
he
turned
back
to
the
room
where
the
candles
had
burned
low
i
will
go
to
westover
he
said
god
knows
i
should
be
a
villain
he
locked
the
picture
of
evelyn
within
his
desk
drank
his
wine
and
water
and
went
to
bed
strongly
resolved
upon
retreat
in
the
morning
he
said
i
will
go
to
westover
this
afternoon
and
in
the
afternoon
he
said
i
will
go
when
the
morrow
came
he
found
that
the
house
lacked
but
one
day
of
being
finished
and
that
there
was
therefore
no
need
for
him
to
go
at
all
mistress
deborah
was
loath
enough
to
take
leave
of
damask
and
mirrors
and
ornaments
of
china
the
latter
fine
enough
and
curious
enough
to
remind
her
of
lady
squander
own
but
the
leaf
of
paper
which
haward
wrote
upon
tore
from
his
and
gave
her
provided
consolation
her
thanks
were
very
glib
her
curtsy
was
very
deep
she
was
his
most
obliged
humble
servant
and
if
she
could
serve
him
again
he
would
make
her
proud
would
he
not
now
some
day
row
up
creek
to
their
poor
house
and
taste
of
her
perry
and
shrewsbury
cakes
audrey
standing
by
raised
her
eyes
and
made
of
the
request
a
royal
invitation
for
a
week
or
more
haward
abode
upon
his
plantation
alone
save
for
his
servants
and
slaves
each
day
he
sent
for
the
overseer
and
listened
gravely
while
that
worthy
expounded
to
him
all
the
details
of
the
condition
and
conduct
of
the
estate
in
the
early
morning
and
the
late
afternoon
he
rode
abroad
through
his
fields
and
forests
mill
and
ferry
and
rolling
house
were
visited
and
the
quarters
made
his
acquaintance
at
the
creek
quarter
and
the
distant
ridge
quarter
were
bestowed
the
newly
bought
the
sullen
and
the
refractory
of
his
chattels
when
after
sunset
and
the
fields
were
silent
he
rode
past
the
cabins
figures
new
from
the
slave
deck
still
seamed
at
wrist
and
ankle
mowed
and
jabbered
at
him
from
over
their
bowls
of
steaming
food
others
who
had
forgotten
the
jungle
and
the
slaver
answered
when
he
spoke
to
them
in
strange
english
others
born
in
virginia
and
remembering
when
he
used
to
ride
that
way
with
his
father
laughed
called
him
marse
duke
and
agreed
with
him
that
the
crop
was
looking
mighty
well
with
the
dark
he
reached
the
great
house
and
negroes
from
the
home
quarter
took
his
horse
while
juba
lighted
him
through
the
echoing
hall
into
the
lonely
rooms
from
the
white
quarter
he
procured
a
facile
lad
who
could
read
and
write
and
who
through
too
much
quickness
of
wit
had
failed
to
prosper
in
england
him
he
installed
as
secretary
and
forthwith
began
a
correspondence
with
friends
in
england
as
well
as
a
long
poem
which
was
to
serve
the
double
purpose
of
giving
pope
a
rival
and
of
occupying
the
mind
of
marmaduke
haward
the
letters
were
witty
and
graceful
the
poem
was
the
same
but
on
the
third
day
the
secretary
pausing
for
the
next
word
that
should
fall
from
his
master
lips
waited
so
long
that
he
dropped
asleep
when
he
awoke
haward
was
slowly
tearing
into
bits
the
work
that
had
been
done
on
the
poem
it
will
have
to
wait
upon
my
mood
he
said
seal
up
the
letter
to
lord
hervey
boy
and
then
begone
to
the
fields
if
i
want
you
again
i
will
send
for
you
the
next
day
he
proposed
to
himself
to
ride
to
williamsburgh
and
see
his
acquaintances
there
but
even
as
he
crossed
the
room
to
strike
the
bell
for
juba
a
distaste
for
the
town
and
its
people
came
upon
him
it
occurred
to
him
that
instead
he
might
take
the
barge
and
be
rowed
up
the
river
to
the
jaquelins
or
to
green
spring
but
in
a
moment
this
plan
also
became
repugnant
finally
he
went
out
upon
the
terrace
and
sat
there
the
morning
through
staring
at
the
river
that
afternoon
he
sent
a
negro
to
the
store
with
a
message
for
the
storekeeper
the
highlander
obeying
the
demand
for
his
company
the
third
or
fourth
since
his
day
at
williamsburgh
came
shortly
before
twilight
to
the
great
house
and
found
the
master
thereof
still
upon
the
terrace
sitting
beneath
an
oak
with
a
small
table
and
a
bottle
of
wine
beside
him
ha
mr
maclean
he
cried
as
the
other
approached
some
days
have
passed
since
last
we
laid
the
ghosts
i
had
meant
to
sooner
improve
our
acquaintance
but
my
house
has
been
in
disorder
and
i
myself
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
face
as
if
to
wipe
away
the
expression
into
which
it
had
been
set
i
myself
have
been
poor
company
there
is
a
witchery
in
the
air
of
this
place
i
am
become
but
a
dreamer
of
dreams
as
he
spoke
he
motioned
his
guest
to
an
empty
chair
and
began
to
pour
wine
for
them
both
his
hand
was
not
quite
steady
and
there
was
about
him
a
restlessness
of
aspect
most
unnatural
to
the
man
the
storekeeper
thought
him
looking
worn
and
as
though
he
had
passed
sleepless
nights
maclean
sat
down
and
drew
his
wineglass
toward
mm
it
is
the
heat
he
said
last
night
in
the
store
i
felt
that
i
was
stifling
and
i
left
it
and
lay
on
the
bare
ground
without
a
star
shot
down
the
sky
and
i
wished
that
a
wind
as
swift
and
strong
would
rise
and
sweep
the
land
out
to
sea
when
the
day
comes
that
i
die
i
wish
to
die
a
fierce
death
it
is
best
to
die
in
battle
for
then
the
mind
is
raised
and
you
taste
all
life
in
the
moment
before
you
go
if
a
man
achieves
not
that
then
struggle
with
earth
or
air
or
the
waves
of
the
sea
is
desirable
driving
sleet
armies
of
the
snow
night
and
trackless
mountains
the
leap
of
the
torrent
swollen
lakes
where
kelpies
lie
in
wait
wind
on
the
sea
with
the
black
reef
and
the
charging
breakers
it
is
well
to
dash
one
force
against
the
force
of
these
and
to
die
after
fighting
but
in
this
cursed
land
of
warmth
and
ease
a
man
dies
like
a
dog
that
is
old
and
hath
lain
winter
and
summer
upon
the
hearthstone
he
drank
his
wine
and
glanced
again
at
haward
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
here
he
said
saunderson
told
me
that
you
were
going
to
westover
i
was
i
am
answered
haward
briefly
presently
he
roused
himself
from
the
brown
study
into
which
he
had
fallen
is
the
heat
as
you
say
it
enervates
for
my
part
i
am
willing
that
your
wind
should
arise
but
it
will
not
blow
there
is
not
a
breath
the
river
is
like
glass
he
raised
the
wine
to
his
lips
and
drank
deeply
come
he
said
laughing
what
did
you
at
the
store
and
does
mistress
truelove
despair
of
your
conversion
to
and
and
peace
with
all
mankind
hast
procured
an
enemy
to
fill
the
place
i
have
vacated
i
trust
he
no
scurvy
foe
i
will
take
your
questions
in
order
answered
the
other
sententiously
this
morning
i
sold
a
deal
of
fine
china
to
a
parcel
of
fine
ladies
who
came
by
water
from
jamestown
and
were
mightily
concerned
to
know
whether
your
worship
was
gone
to
westover
or
had
instead
as
was
reported
shut
yourself
up
in
fair
view
house
and
this
afternoon
came
over
in
a
periagua
from
the
other
side
a
very
young
gentleman
with
money
in
hand
to
buy
a
glove
are
sold
in
pairs
said
i
i
require
but
one
said
he
dick
allen
who
hath
slandered
me
to
mistress
betty
cocke
dareth
to
appear
at
the
merrymaking
at
colonel
harrison
his
cheek
and
this
glove
shall
come
together
you
must
pay
for
both
i
told
him
and
the
upshot
is
that
he
leaves
with
me
a
gold
button
as
earnest
that
he
will
bring
the
remainder
of
the
price
before
the
duel
that
quaker
maiden
of
whom
you
ask
hath
a
soul
like
the
soul
of
of
whom
murdoch
the
harper
of
coll
used
to
sing
she
is
fair
as
a
flower
after
winter
and
as
tender
as
the
rose
flush
in
which
swims
yonder
star
when
i
am
with
her
almost
she
persuades
me
to
think
ill
of
honest
hatred
and
to
pine
no
longer
that
it
was
not
i
that
had
the
killing
of
ewin
mackinnon
he
gave
a
short
laugh
and
stooping
picked
up
an
oak
twig
from
the
ground
and
with
deliberation
broke
it
into
many
small
pieces
almost
but
not
quite
he
said
there
was
in
that
feud
nothing
illusory
or
fantastic
nothing
of
the
quality
that
marked
mayhap
another
feud
of
my
own
making
if
i
have
found
that
in
this
latter
case
i
took
a
wraith
and
dubbed
it
my
enemy
that
thinking
i
followed
a
foe
i
followed
a
friend
instead
he
threw
away
the
bits
of
bark
and
straightened
himself
a
friend
he
said
drawing
his
breath
save
for
this
quaker
family
i
have
had
no
friend
for
many
a
year
and
i
can
not
talk
to
them
of
honor
and
warfare
and
the
wide
world
his
speech
was
sombre
but
in
his
eyes
there
was
an
eagerness
not
without
pathos
the
mood
of
the
gael
chimed
with
the
present
mood
of
the
saxon
as
unlike
in
their
natures
as
their
histories
men
would
have
called
them
and
yet
far
away
in
dim
recesses
of
the
soul
at
long
distances
from
the
flesh
each
recognised
the
other
and
it
was
an
evening
too
in
which
to
take
care
of
other
things
than
the
ways
and
speech
of
every
day
the
heat
the
hush
and
the
stillness
appeared
preternatural
a
sadness
breathed
over
the
earth
all
things
seemed
new
and
yet
old
across
the
spectral
river
the
dim
plains
beneath
the
afterglow
took
the
seeming
of
battlefields
a
friend
said
haward
there
are
many
men
who
call
themselves
my
friends
i
am
melancholy
restless
and
divided
against
myself
i
do
not
know
one
of
my
acquaintance
whom
i
would
have
called
to
be
melancholy
with
me
as
i
have
called
you
he
leaned
across
the
table
and
touched
maclean
hand
that
was
somewhat
hurriedly
fingering
the
wineglass
come
he
said
loneliness
may
haunt
the
level
fields
as
well
as
the
ways
that
are
rugged
and
steep
how
many
times
have
we
held
converse
since
that
day
i
found
you
in
charge
of
my
store
often
enough
i
think
for
each
to
know
the
other
quality
our
lives
have
been
very
different
and
yet
i
believe
that
we
are
akin
for
myself
i
should
be
glad
to
hold
as
my
friend
so
gallant
though
so
unfortunate
a
gentleman
he
smiled
and
made
a
gesture
of
courtesy
of
course
maclean
may
very
justly
not
hold
me
in
a
like
esteem
nor
desire
a
closer
relation
maclean
rose
to
his
feet
and
stood
gazing
across
the
river
at
the
twilight
shore
and
the
clear
skies
presently
he
turned
and
his
eyes
were
wet
he
drew
his
hand
across
them
then
looked
curiously
at
the
dew
upon
it
i
have
not
done
this
he
said
simply
since
a
night
at
preston
when
i
wept
with
rage
in
my
country
we
love
as
we
hate
with
all
the
strength
that
god
has
given
us
the
brother
of
my
spirit
is
to
me
even
as
the
brother
of
my
flesh
i
used
to
dream
that
my
hand
was
at
your
throat
or
my
sword
through
your
heart
and
wake
in
anger
that
it
was
not
so
and
now
i
could
love
you
well
haward
stood
up
and
the
two
men
clasped
hands
it
is
a
pact
then
said
the
englishman
by
my
faith
the
world
looks
not
so
melancholy
gray
as
it
did
awhile
ago
and
here
is
juba
to
say
that
supper
waits
lay
the
table
for
two
juba
maclean
will
bear
me
company
the
storekeeper
stayed
late
the
master
of
fair
view
being
an
accomplished
gentleman
a
very
good
talker
and
an
adept
at
turning
his
house
for
the
nonce
into
the
house
of
his
guest
supper
over
they
went
into
the
library
where
their
wine
was
set
and
where
the
highlander
who
was
no
great
reader
gazed
respectfully
at
the
wit
and
wisdom
arow
before
him
colonel
byrd
hath
more
volumes
at
westover
quoth
haward
but
mine
are
of
the
choicer
quality
juba
brought
a
card
table
and
lit
more
candles
while
his
master
unlocking
a
desk
took
from
it
a
number
of
gold
pieces
these
he
divided
into
two
equal
portions
kept
one
beside
him
upon
the
polished
table
and
with
a
fine
smile
half
humorous
half
deprecating
pushed
the
other
across
to
his
guest
with
an
imperturbable
face
maclean
stacked
the
gold
before
him
and
they
fell
to
piquet
playing
briskly
and
with
occasional
application
to
the
madeira
upon
the
larger
table
until
ten
of
the
clock
the
highlander
then
declaring
that
he
must
be
no
longer
away
from
his
post
swept
his
heap
of
coins
across
to
swell
his
store
and
said
haward
went
with
him
to
the
great
door
and
watched
him
stride
off
through
the
darkness
whistling
the
battle
of
harlaw
that
night
haward
slept
and
the
next
morning
four
negroes
rowed
him
up
the
river
to
jamestown
jaquelin
was
gone
to
norfolk
upon
business
but
his
beautiful
wife
and
sprightly
daughters
found
marmaduke
haward
altogether
charming
was
as
good
as
going
to
court
they
said
to
one
another
when
the
gentleman
after
a
two
hours
visit
bowed
himself
out
of
their
the
object
of
their
encomiums
going
down
river
in
his
barge
felt
his
spirits
lighter
than
they
had
been
for
some
days
he
spoke
cheerfully
to
his
negroes
and
when
the
barge
passed
a
couple
of
he
called
to
the
slim
brown
lads
that
caught
for
the
plantation
to
know
their
luck
at
the
landing
he
found
the
overseer
who
walked
to
the
great
house
with
him
the
night
before
tyburn
will
had
stolen
from
the
white
quarters
and
had
met
a
couple
of
seamen
from
the
temperance
at
the
crossroads
ordinary
which
ordinary
was
going
to
get
into
trouble
for
breaking
the
law
which
forbade
the
harboring
of
sailors
ashore
the
three
had
taken
in
full
lading
of
rum
and
tyburn
will
too
drunk
to
run
any
farther
had
been
caught
by
hide
near
princess
creek
three
hours
agone
what
were
the
master
orders
should
the
rogue
go
to
the
whipping
post
or
should
hide
save
the
trouble
of
taking
him
there
in
either
case
lashes
well
laid
on
the
master
pursed
his
lips
dug
into
the
ground
with
the
ferrule
of
his
cane
and
finally
proposed
to
the
astonished
overseer
that
the
rascal
be
let
off
with
a
warning
is
too
fair
a
day
to
poison
with
ugly
sights
and
sounds
he
said
whimsically
apologetic
for
his
own
weakness
do
no
great
harm
to
be
lenient
for
once
saunderson
and
i
am
in
the
mood
to
be
friends
with
all
men
including
myself
the
overseer
went
away
grumbling
and
haward
entered
the
house
the
room
where
dwelt
his
books
looked
cool
and
inviting
he
walked
the
length
of
the
shelves
took
out
a
volume
here
and
there
for
his
evening
reading
and
upon
the
binding
of
others
laid
an
affectionate
lingering
touch
i
have
had
a
fever
my
friends
he
announced
to
the
books
but
i
am
about
to
find
myself
happily
restored
to
reason
and
serenity
in
short
to
health
some
hours
later
he
raised
his
eyes
from
the
floor
which
he
had
been
studying
for
a
great
while
covered
them
for
a
moment
with
his
hand
then
rose
and
with
the
air
of
a
sleepwalker
went
out
of
the
lit
room
into
a
calm
and
fragrant
night
there
was
no
moon
but
the
stars
were
many
and
it
did
not
seem
dark
when
he
came
to
the
verge
of
the
landing
and
the
river
sighing
in
its
sleep
lay
clear
below
him
mirroring
the
stars
it
was
as
though
he
stood
between
two
firmaments
he
descended
the
steps
and
drew
toward
him
a
small
rowboat
that
was
softly
rubbing
against
the
wet
and
glistening
piles
the
tide
was
out
and
the
night
was
very
quiet
haward
troubled
not
the
midstream
but
rowing
in
the
shadow
of
the
bank
to
the
mouth
of
the
creek
that
slept
beside
his
garden
turned
and
went
up
this
narrow
water
until
he
was
free
of
the
wall
the
odor
of
honeysuckle
and
box
clung
to
the
air
freighting
it
heavily
when
it
was
left
behind
the
reeds
began
to
murmur
and
sigh
though
not
loudly
for
there
was
no
wind
when
he
came
to
a
point
opposite
the
minister
house
rising
fifty
yards
away
from
amidst
low
orchard
trees
he
rested
upon
his
oars
there
was
a
light
in
an
upper
room
and
as
he
looked
audrey
passed
between
the
candle
and
the
open
window
a
moment
later
and
the
light
was
out
but
he
knew
that
she
was
sitting
at
the
window
though
it
was
dark
he
found
that
he
could
call
back
with
precision
the
slender
throat
the
lifted
face
and
the
enshadowing
hair
for
a
while
he
stayed
motionless
in
his
boat
hidden
by
the
reeds
that
whispered
and
sighed
but
at
last
he
rowed
away
softly
through
the
darkness
back
to
the
dim
river
and
the
fair
view
landing
this
was
of
a
friday
all
the
next
day
he
spent
in
the
garden
but
on
sunday
morning
he
sent
word
to
the
stables
to
have
mirza
saddled
he
was
going
to
church
he
told
juba
over
his
chocolate
and
he
would
wear
the
gray
and
silver
chapter
xiii
a
sabbath
day
journey
although
the
house
of
worship
which
boasted
as
its
ornament
the
reverend
gideon
darden
was
not
so
large
and
handsome
as
bruton
church
nor
could
rival
the
painted
glories
of
poplar
spring
it
was
yet
a
building
good
enough
of
brick
with
a
fair
white
spire
and
a
decorous
mantle
of
ivy
the
churchyard
too
was
pleasant
though
somewhat
crowded
with
the
dead
there
were
oaks
for
shade
and
wild
roses
for
fragrance
and
the
grass
between
the
long
gravestones
prone
upon
mortal
dust
grew
very
thick
and
green
outside
the
gates
a
gift
from
the
first
master
of
fair
view
between
the
churchyard
and
the
dusty
highroad
ran
a
long
strip
of
trampled
turf
shaded
by
and
by
one
gigantic
gum
that
became
in
the
autumn
a
pillar
of
fire
haward
arriving
somewhat
after
time
found
drawn
up
upon
this
piece
of
sward
a
coach
two
berlins
a
calash
and
three
chaises
while
tied
to
trees
and
the
fence
were
a
number
of
in
the
shade
of
the
sprawled
half
a
dozen
negro
servants
but
on
the
box
of
the
coach
from
which
the
restless
horses
had
been
taken
there
yet
sat
the
coachman
a
mulatto
of
powerful
build
and
a
sullen
countenance
the
vehicle
stood
in
the
blazing
sunshine
and
it
was
both
cooler
and
merrier
beneath
the
tree
a
fact
apparent
enough
to
the
coachman
but
the
knowledge
of
which
seeing
that
he
was
chained
to
the
box
did
him
small
good
haward
glanced
at
the
figure
indifferently
but
juba
following
his
master
upon
whitefoot
kate
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
larnin
not
to
run
away
sam
road
clear
why
don
you
carry
off
de

haward
dismounted
and
leaving
juba
first
to
fasten
the
horses
and
then
join
his
fellows
beneath
the
walked
into
the
churchyard
the
congregation
had
assembled
and
besides
himself
there
were
none
without
the
church
save
the
negroes
and
the
dead
the
service
had
commenced
through
the
open
door
came
to
him
darden
voice
beloved
haward
waited
leaning
against
a
tomb
deep
graven
with
a
coat
of
arms
and
much
stately
latin
until
the
singing
clave
the
air
when
he
entered
the
building
and
passed
down
the
aisle
to
his
own
pew
the
chiefest
in
the
place
he
was
aware
of
the
flutter
and
whisper
on
either
hand
perhaps
he
did
not
find
it
unpleasing
diogenes
may
have
carried
his
lantern
not
merely
to
find
a
man
but
to
show
one
as
well
and
a
philosopher
in
a
pale
gray
riding
dress
cut
after
the
latest
mode
with
silver
lace
and
a
fall
of
mechlin
may
be
trusted
to
know
the
value
as
well
as
the
vanity
of
sublunary
things
of
the
gathering
which
was
not
large
two
thirds
perhaps
were
people
of
condition
and
in
the
country
where
occasions
for
display
did
not
present
themselves
uncalled
it
was
highly
becoming
to
worship
the
lord
in
fine
clothes
so
there
were
broken
rainbows
in
the
tall
pews
with
a
soft
waving
of
fans
to
and
fro
in
the
essenced
air
and
a
low
rustle
of
silk
the
men
went
as
fine
as
the
women
and
the
june
sunshine
pouring
in
upon
all
this
lustre
and
color
made
a
of
the
assemblage
being
of
the
country
it
was
vastly
better
behaved
than
would
have
been
a
fashionable
london
congregation
but
it
certainly
saw
no
reason
why
marmaduke
haward
should
not
during
the
anthem
turn
his
back
upon
altar
minister
and
clerk
and
employ
himself
in
recognizing
with
a
smile
and
an
inclination
of
his
head
his
friends
and
acquaintances
they
smiled
back
the
gentlemen
bowing
slightly
the
ladies
making
a
sketch
of
a
curtsy
all
were
glad
that
fair
view
house
was
open
once
more
and
were
kindly
disposed
toward
the
master
thereof
the
eyes
of
that
gentleman
were
no
longer
for
the
gay
parterre
between
it
and
the
door
in
uncushioned
pews
or
on
rude
benches
were
to
be
found
the
plainer
sort
of
darden
parishioners
and
in
this
territory
that
was
like
a
border
of
sober
foliage
to
the
in
front
he
discovered
whom
he
sought
her
gaze
had
been
upon
him
since
he
passed
the
minister
pew
where
she
stood
between
my
lady
squander
and
the
branded
schoolmaster
but
now
their
eyes
came
full
together
she
was
dressed
in
some
coarse
dark
stuff
above
which
rose
the
brown
pillar
of
her
throat
and
the
elusive
singular
beauty
of
her
face
there
was
a
flower
in
her
hair
placed
as
he
had
placed
the
rosebuds
a
splendor
leaped
into
her
eyes
but
her
cheek
did
not
redden
it
was
to
his
face
that
the
color
rushed
they
had
but
a
moment
in
which
to
gaze
at
each
other
for
the
singing
which
to
her
at
least
had
seemed
suddenly
to
swell
into
a
great
ascending
tide
of
sound
with
somewhere
far
away
the
silver
calling
of
a
trumpet
now
came
to
an
end
and
with
another
silken
rustle
and
murmur
the
congregation
sat
down
haward
did
not
turn
again
and
the
service
went
drowsily
on
darden
was
bleared
of
eye
and
somewhat
thick
of
voice
the
clerk
whine
was
as
sleepy
a
sound
as
the
buzzing
of
the
bees
in
and
out
of
window
or
the
soft
incessant
stir
of
painted
fans
a
churchwarden
in
the
next
pew
nodded
and
nodded
until
he
nodded
his
peruke
awry
and
a
child
went
fast
asleep
with
its
head
in
its
mother
lap
one
and
all
worshiped
somewhat
languidly
with
frequent
glances
at
the
hourglass
upon
the
pulpit
they
prayed
for
king
george
the
first
not
knowing
that
he
was
dead
and
for
the
prince
not
knowing
that
he
was
king
the
minister
preached
against
quakers
and
witchcraft
and
shook
the
rafters
with
his
fulminations
finally
came
the
benediction
and
a
sigh
of
relief
in
that
country
and
time
there
was
no
unsociable
and
undignified
scurrying
homeward
after
church
decorous
silence
prevailed
until
the
house
was
exchanged
for
the
green
and
shady
churchyard
but
then
tongues
were
loosened
and
the
broken
into
clusters
one
must
greet
neighbors
present
or
be
presented
to
what
company
might
be
staying
at
the
various
great
houses
within
the
parish
talk
laugh
coquet
and
ogle
make
appointments
for
business
or
for
pleasure
speak
of
the
last
the
condition
of
wheat
and
tobacco
and
the
news
brought
in
by
the
valour
that
the
king
was
gone
to
hanover
in
short
for
the
nonce
the
churchyard
became
a
with
the
sun
for
candles
with
no
painted
images
of
the
past
and
gone
upon
the
walls
but
with
the
dead
themselves
beneath
the
floor
the
minister
having
questions
to
settle
with
clerk
and
sexton
tarried
in
the
vestry
room
but
his
wife
with
audrey
and
the
schoolmaster
waited
for
him
outside
in
the
shade
of
an
that
was
just
without
the
pale
of
the
mistress
deborah
in
her
tarnished
amber
satin
and
ribbons
that
had
outworn
their
youth
bit
her
lip
and
tapped
her
foot
upon
the
ground
audrey
watched
her
apprehensively
she
knew
the
signs
and
that
when
they
reached
home
a
storm
might
break
that
would
leave
its
mark
upon
her
shoulders
the
minister
wife
was
not
approved
of
by
the
ladies
of
fair
view
parish
but
had
they
seen
how
wistful
was
the
face
of
the
brown
girl
with
her
they
might
have
turned
aside
spoken
and
let
the
storm
go
by
the
girl
herself
was
scarcely
noticed
few
had
ever
heard
her
story
or
hearing
it
had
remembered
the
careless
many
thought
her
an
orphan
bound
to
darden
and
his
wife
in
effect
their
servant
if
she
had
beauty
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
saw
her
sunday
after
sunday
in
the
minister
pew
had
scarce
discovered
it
she
was
too
dark
too
slim
too
shy
and
strange
of
look
with
her
great
brown
eyes
and
that
startled
turn
of
her
head
their
taste
was
for
lilies
and
roses
and
it
was
not
an
age
that
counted
shyness
a
grace
marmaduke
haward
was
not
likely
to
be
accused
of
diffidence
he
had
come
out
of
church
with
the
churchwarden
who
was
now
wide
awake
and
mightily
concerned
to
know
what
horse
haward
meant
to
enter
for
the
great
race
at
mulberry
island
while
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
he
was
seized
upon
by
another
portly
vestryman
and
borne
off
to
be
presented
to
three
blooming
young
ladies
quick
to
second
their
papa
invitation
home
to
dinner
haward
was
ready
to
curse
his
luck
that
he
was
engaged
elsewhere
but
were
not
these
graces
the
children
to
whom
he
had
used
to
send
from
williamsburgh
years
and
years
ago
he
vowed
that
the
payment
which
he
had
never
received
he
would
take
now
with
usury
and
proceeded
to
salute
the
cheek
of
each
protesting
fair
the
ladies
found
him
vastly
agreeable
old
and
new
friends
crowded
around
him
he
put
forth
his
powers
and
charmed
all
hearts
and
all
the
while
inwardly
cursed
the
length
of
way
to
the
gates
and
the
tardy
progress
thereto
of
his
friends
and
neighbors
but
however
slow
in
ebbing
the
tide
was
really
set
toward
home
and
dinner
darden
coming
out
of
the
vestry
room
found
the
churchyard
almost
cleared
and
the
road
in
a
cloud
of
dust
the
greater
number
of
those
who
came
were
gone
and
there
had
also
departed
both
berlins
the
calash
and
two
chaises
haward
was
handing
the
three
graces
into
the
coach
with
the
chained
coachman
juba
standing
by
holding
his
horse
darden
grew
something
purpler
in
the
face
and
rumbling
oaths
went
over
to
the
three
beneath
the
oak
how
many
spoke
to
you
he
asked
roughly
of
his
wife
did
come
and
speak
no
he
did
cried
mistress
deborah
tartly
and
all
the
gentry
went
by
only
bray
stopped
to
say
that
everybody
knew
of
your
fight
with
bailey
at
the
french
ordinary
and
that
the
commissary
had
sent
for
bailey
and
was
going
to
suspend
him
i
wish
to
heaven
i
knew
why
i
married
you
to
be
looked
down
upon
by
every
jill
when
i
might
have
had
his
lordship
own
man
of
all
the
fools
you
were
not
the
only
one
answered
her
husband
grimly
well
home
there
dinner
yet
what
is
it
audrey
this
in
answer
to
an
inarticulate
sound
from
the
girl
the
schoolmaster
answered
for
her
marmaduke
haward
has
not
gone
with
the
coach
perhaps
he
only
waited
until
the
other
gentlefolk
should
be
gone
here
he
comes
the
sward
without
the
gates
was
bare
of
all
whose
presence
mattered
and
haward
had
indeed
reëntered
the
churchyard
and
was
walking
toward
them
darden
went
to
meet
him
these
be
fine
tales
i
hear
of
you
darden
said
his
parishioner
calmly
i
should
judge
you
were
near
the
end
of
your
rope
there
a
vestry
meeting
thursday
shall
i
put
in
a
good
word
for
your
reverence
egad
you
need
it
i
shall
be
your
honor
most
humble
most
obliged
servant
quoth
the
minister
the
affair
at
the
french
ordinary
was
nothing
i
mean
to
preach
next
sunday
upon
calumny
calumny
that
spareth
none
not
even
such
as
i
you
are
for
home
i
see
and
our
road
for
a
time
is
the
same
will
you
ride
with
us
ay
said
haward
briefly
but
you
must
send
yonder
fellow
with
the
scarred
hands
packing
i
travel
not
with
thieves
he
had
not
troubled
to
lower
his
voice
and
as
he
and
darden
were
now
themselves
within
the
shadow
of
the
oak
the
schoolmaster
overheard
him
and
answered
for
himself
your
honor
need
not
fear
my
company
he
said
in
his
slow
and
lifeless
tones
i
am
walking
and
i
take
the
short
cut
through
the
woods
worthy
gideon
madam
deborah
and
audrey
he
put
his
uncouth
shambling
figure
into
motion
and
indifferent
and
lifeless
in
manner
as
in
voice
was
gone
gliding
like
a
long
black
shadow
through
the
churchyard
and
into
the
woods
across
the
road
i
knew
him
long
ago
in
england
the
minister
explained
to
their
new
companion
he
a
learned
man
and
like
myself
a
calumniated
one
the
gentlemen
of
these
parts
value
him
highly
as
an
instructor
of
youth
no
need
to
send
their
sons
to
college
if
they
been
with
him
for
a
year
or
two
my
good
deborah
haward
will
ride
with
us
toward
fair
view
mistress
deborah
curtsied
then
chided
audrey
for
not
minding
her
manners
but
standing
like
a
stock
or
stone
with
her
thoughts
a
thousand
miles
away
let
her
be
said
haward
we
gave
each
other
in
church
together
the
four
left
the
churchyard
darden
brought
up
two
sorry
horses
lifted
his
wife
and
audrey
upon
one
and
mounted
the
other
haward
swung
himself
into
his
saddle
and
the
company
started
juba
upon
whitefoot
kate
bringing
up
the
rear
the
master
of
fair
view
rode
beside
the
minister
and
only
now
and
then
spoke
to
the
women
the
road
was
here
sunny
there
shady
the
excessive
heat
broken
the
air
pleasant
enough
everywhere
too
was
the
singing
of
birds
while
the
fields
that
they
passed
of
tobacco
and
golden
waving
wheat
were
charming
to
the
sight
the
minister
was
when
sober
a
man
of
parts
with
some
education
and
a
deal
of
mother
wit
in
addition
a
close
and
shrewd
observer
of
the
times
and
people
he
and
haward
talked
of
matters
of
public
moment
and
the
two
women
listened
submissive
and
admiring
it
seemed
that
they
came
very
quickly
to
the
bridge
across
the
creek
and
the
parting
of
their
ways
would
haward
ride
on
to
the
glebe
house
it
appeared
that
haward
would
moreover
when
the
house
was
reached
and
darden
one
slave
came
running
from
a
stable
to
take
the
horses
he
made
no
motion
toward
returning
to
the
bridge
which
led
across
the
creek
to
his
own
plantation
but
instead
dismounted
flung
his
reins
to
juba
and
asked
if
he
might
stay
to
dinner
now
by
the
greatest
good
luck
considered
mistress
deborah
there
chanced
to
be
in
her
larder
a
haunch
of
venison
roasted
most
noble
the
ducklings
and
asparagus
too
cooked
before
church
needed
but
to
be
popped
into
the
oven
and
there
was
also
an
apple
tart
with
cream
with
elation
then
and
eke
with
a
mind
at
rest
she
added
her
shrill
protests
of
delight
to
darden
more
moderate
assurances
and
leaving
audrey
to
set
chairs
in
the
shade
of
a
great
hurried
into
the
house
to
unearth
her
damask
tablecloth
and
silver
spoons
and
to
plan
for
the
morrow
a
visit
to
the
widow
constance
and
a
casual
remark
that
marmaduke
haward
had
dined
with
the
minister
the
day
before
audrey
her
task
done
went
after
her
to
be
met
with
graciousness
most
unusual
i
see
to
the
dinner
child
haward
will
expect
one
of
us
to
sit
without
and
you
had
as
well
go
as
i
if
he
talking
to
darden
you
might
get
some
larkspur
and
gilliflowers
for
the
table
la
the
flowers
that
used
to
wither
beneath
the
candles
at
my
lady
squander
audrey
finding
the
two
men
in
conversation
beneath
the
passed
on
to
the
ragged
garden
where
clumps
of
hardy
flowers
played
with
currant
and
gooseberry
bushes
haward
saw
her
go
and
broke
the
thread
of
his
discourse
darden
looked
up
and
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
met
those
of
the
younger
were
cold
and
steady
a
moment
and
his
glance
had
fallen
to
his
watch
which
he
had
pulled
out
is
early
yet
he
said
coolly
and
i
dare
say
not
quite
your
dinner
time
which
i
beg
that
mistress
deborah
will
not
advance
on
my
account
is
it
not
your
reverence
habit
to
rest
within
doors
after
your
sermon
pray
do
not
let
me
detain
you
i
will
go
talk
awhile
with
audrey
he
put
up
his
watch
and
rose
to
his
feet
darden
cleared
his
throat
i
have
indeed
a
letter
to
write
to
commissary
and
it
may
be
half
an
hour
before
deborah
has
dinner
ready
i
will
send
your
servant
to
fetch
you
in
haward
broke
the
larkspur
and
gilliflowers
and
audrey
gathered
up
her
apron
and
filled
it
with
the
vivid
blooms
the
child
that
had
thus
brought
loaves
of
bread
to
a
governor
table
spread
beneath
a
with
mountains
round
about
had
been
no
purer
of
heart
no
more
innocent
of
rustic
coquetry
when
her
apron
was
filled
she
would
have
returned
to
the
house
but
haward
would
not
have
it
so
they
will
call
when
dinner
is
ready
he
said
i
wish
to
talk
to
you
little
maid
let
us
go
sit
in
the
shade
of
the
willow
yonder
it
was
almost
a
twilight
behind
the
cool
green
rain
of
the
willow
boughs
through
that
verdant
mist
haward
and
audrey
saw
the
outer
world
but
dimly
i
had
a
fearful
dream
last
night
said
audrey
i
think
that
that
must
have
been
why
i
was
to
glad
to
see
you
come
into
church
i
dreamed
that
you
had
never
come
home
again
overseas
in
the
golden
rose
hugon
was
beside
me
in
the
dream
telling
me
that
you
were
dead
in
england
and
suddenly
i
knew
that
i
had
never
really
seen
you
that
there
was
no
garden
no
terrace
no
roses
no
it
was
all
so
cold
and
sad
and
the
sun
kept
growing
smaller
and
smaller
the
woods
too
were
black
and
the
wind
cried
in
them
so
that
i
was
afraid
and
then
i
was
in
house
holding
the
door
there
was
a
wolf
without
and
through
the
window
i
saw
the
mountains
only
they
were
so
high
that
my
heart
ached
to
look
upon
them
and
the
wind
cried
down
the
cleft
in
the
hills
the
wolf
went
away
and
then
somehow
i
was
upon
the
hilltop
there
was
a
dead
man
lying
in
the
grass
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
hugon
came
up
behind
me
stooped
and
lifted
the
hand
upon
the
finger
was
that
ring
you
wear
burning
in
the
moonlight
oh
me
the
remembered
horror
of
her
dream
contending
with
present
bliss
shook
her
spirit
to
its
centre
she
shuddered
violently
then
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
haward
touch
upon
her
hair
haward
voice
in
her
ear
all
the
old
terms
of
endearment
for
a
frightened
child
little
maid
little
coward
why
sweetheart
these
things
are
shadows
they
can
not
hurt
thee
she
controlled
her
tears
and
was
the
happier
for
her
weeping
it
was
sweet
to
sit
there
in
the
lush
grass
veiled
and
shadowed
from
the
world
by
the
willow
drooping
green
and
in
that
soft
and
happy
light
to
listen
to
his
voice
half
laughing
half
chiding
wholly
tender
and
caressing
dreams
were
naught
he
said
had
hugon
troubled
her
waking
hours
he
had
come
once
to
the
house
it
appeared
but
she
had
run
away
and
hidden
in
the
wood
and
the
minister
had
told
him
she
was
gone
to
the
widow
constance
that
was
a
long
time
ago
it
must
have
been
the
day
after
she
and
mistress
deborah
had
last
come
from
fair
view
a
long
time
said
haward
it
was
a
week
ago
has
it
seemed
a
long
time
audrey
yes
oh
yes
i
have
been
busy
i
must
learn
to
be
a
planter
you
know
but
i
have
thought
of
you
little
maid
audrey
was
glad
of
that
but
there
was
yet
a
weight
upon
her
heart
after
that
dream
i
lay
awake
all
night
and
it
came
to
me
how
wrongly
i
had
done
hugon
is
a
wicked
man
an
indian
oh
i
should
never
have
told
you
that
first
day
in
the
garden
that
he
was
waiting
for
me
outside
for
now
because
you
took
care
of
me
and
would
not
let
him
come
near
he
hates
you
he
is
so
wicked
that
he
might
do
you
a
harm
her
eyes
widened
and
the
hand
that
touched
his
was
cold
and
trembling
if
ever
hurt
came
to
you
through
me
i
would
drown
myself
in
the
river
yonder
and
then
i
thought
lying
awake
last
night
that
perhaps
i
had
been
troublesome
to
you
those
days
at
fair
view
and
that
was
why
you
had
not
come
to
see
the
minister
as
you
had
said
you
would
the
dark
eyes
were
pitifully
eager
the
hand
that
went
to
her
heart
trembled
more
and
more
it
is
not
as
it
was
in
the
mountains
she
said
i
am
older
now
and
safe
and
and
happy
and
you
have
many
things
to
do
and
to
think
of
and
many
friends
gentlemen
and
beautiful
ladies
to
go
to
see
i
thought
last
night
that
when
i
saw
you
i
would
ask
your
pardon
for
not
remembering
that
the
mountains
were
years
ago
for
troubling
you
with
my
matters
sir
for
making
too
free
forgetting
my
place
her
voice
sank
the
shamed
red
was
in
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
that
she
had
bravely
kept
upon
his
face
fell
to
the
purple
and
gold
blooms
in
her
lap
haward
rose
from
the
grass
and
with
his
back
to
the
gray
hole
of
the
willow
looked
first
at
the
veil
of
leaf
and
stem
through
which
dimly
showed
house
orchard
and
blue
sky
then
down
upon
the
girl
at
his
feet
her
head
was
bent
and
she
sat
very
still
one
listless
upturned
hand
upon
the
grass
beside
her
the
other
lying
as
quietly
among
her
flowers
audrey
he
said
at
last
you
shame
me
in
your
thoughts
of
me
i
am
not
that
knight
without
fear
and
without
reproach
for
which
you
take
me
being
what
i
am
you
must
believe
that
you
have
not
wearied
me
that
i
think
of
you
and
wish
to
see
you
and
hugon
having
possibly
some
care
for
his
own
neck
will
do
me
no
harm
that
is
a
very
foolish
notion
which
you
must
put
from
you
now
listen
he
knelt
beside
her
and
took
her
hand
in
his
after
a
while
perhaps
when
the
weather
is
cooler
and
i
must
open
my
house
and
entertain
after
the
fashion
of
the
country
when
the
new
governor
comes
in
and
all
this
gay
little
world
of
virginia
flocks
to
williamsburgh
when
i
am
a
councilor
and
must
go
with
the
rest
and
must
think
of
gold
and
place
and
people
why
then
maybe
our
paths
will
again
diverge
and
only
now
and
then
will
i
catch
the
gleam
of
your
skirt
mountain
maid
brown
audrey
but
now
in
these
midsummer
days
it
is
a
sleepy
world
that
cares
not
to
go
bustling
up
and
down
i
am
alone
in
my
house
i
visit
not
nor
am
visited
and
the
days
hang
heavy
let
us
make
believe
for
a
time
that
the
mountains
are
all
around
us
that
it
was
but
yesterday
we
traveled
together
it
is
only
a
little
way
from
fair
view
to
the
glebe
house
from
the
glebe
house
to
fair
view
i
will
see
you
often
little
maid
and
you
must
dream
no
more
as
you
dreamed
last
night
he
paused
his
voice
changed
and
he
went
on
as
to
himself
it
is
a
lonely
land
with
few
to
see
and
none
to
care
i
will
drift
with
the
summer
making
of
it
an
idyl
beautiful
yes
and
innocent
when
autumn
comes
i
will
go
to
westover
of
this
speech
audrey
caught
only
the
last
word
a
wonderful
smile
so
bright
was
it
and
withal
so
sad
came
into
her
face
westover
she
said
to
herself
that
is
where
the
princess
lives
we
will
let
thought
alone
continued
haward
it
suits
not
with
this
charmed
light
this
glamour
of
the
summer
he
made
a
laughing
gesture
hey
presto
little
maid
there
go
the
years
rolling
back
i
swear
i
see
the
mountains
through
the
willow
leaves
there
was
one
like
a
wall
shutting
out
the
sun
when
he
went
down
answered
audrey
it
was
black
and
grim
and
the
light
flared
like
a
fire
behind
it
and
there
was
the
one
above
which
the
moon
rose
it
was
sharp
pointing
like
a
finger
to
heaven
and
i
liked
it
best
do
you
remember
how
large
was
the
moon
pushing
up
behind
the
we
sat
on
the
dark
hillside
watching
it
and
you
told
me
beautiful
stories
while
the
moon
rose
higher
and
higher
and
the
mockingbirds
began
to
sing
haward
remembered
not
but
he
said
that
he
did
so
the
moon
is
full
again
he
continued
and
last
night
i
heard
a
mockingbird
in
the
garden
i
will
come
in
the
barge
evening
and
the
negroes
shall
row
us
up
and
down
the
river
you
and
me
and
mistress
deborah
between
the
sunset
and
the
moonrise
then
it
is
lonely
and
sweet
upon
the
water
the
roses
can
be
smelled
from
the
banks
and
if
you
will
speak
to
the
mockingbirds
we
shall
have
music
dryad
audrey
brown
maid
of
the
woods
audrey
laugh
was
and
sweet
like
that
of
a
forest
nymph
indeed
she
was
quite
happy
again
with
all
her
doubts
and
fears
allayed
they
had
never
been
of
him
only
of
herself
the
two
sat
within
the
green
and
swaying
fountain
of
the
willow
and
time
went
by
on
eagle
wings
too
soon
came
the
slave
to
call
them
to
the
house
the
time
within
though
spent
in
the
company
of
darden
and
his
wife
passed
too
soon
too
soon
came
the
long
shadows
of
the
afternoon
and
haward
call
for
his
horse
audrey
watched
him
ride
away
and
the
love
light
was
in
her
eyes
she
did
not
know
that
it
was
so
that
night
in
her
bare
little
room
when
the
candle
was
out
she
kneeled
by
the
window
and
looked
at
the
stars
there
was
one
very
fair
and
golden
an
empress
of
the
night
that
is
the
princess
said
audrey
and
smiled
upon
the
peerless
star
far
from
that
light
scarce
free
from
the
murk
of
the
horizon
shone
a
little
star
companionless
in
the
night
and
that
is

audrey

at

spinning
in
the
doorway
of
her
father
house
truelove
answered
naught
but
her
hands
went
to
and
fro
and
her
eyes
were
for
her
work
not
for
maclean
sitting
on
the
doorstep
at
her
feet
whether
they
gone
beyond

the
exile
broke
off
and
sighed
heavily
before
the
two
a
little
yard
all
gay
with
hollyhocks
and
roses
sloped
down
to
the
wider
of
the
two
creeks
between
which
stretched
the
fair
view
plantation
it
was
late
of
a
holiday
afternoon
a
storm
was
brewing
darkening
all
the
water
and
erecting
above
the
sweep
of
woods
monstrous
towers
of
gray
cloud
there
must
have
been
an
echo
for
maclean
sigh
came
back
to
him
faintly
as
became
an
echo
is
there
not
peace
here
the
sea
said
truelove
softly
thine
must
be
a
dreadful
country
angus
maclean
the
highlander
looked
at
her
with
kindling
eyes
now
had
i
the
harp
of
old
murdoch
he
said
is
that
land
to
the
east
alba
of
the
lakes
oh
that
i
might
dwell
there
forever
he
turned
upon
the
doorstep
and
taking
between
his
fingers
the
hem
of
truelove
apron
fell
to
plaiting
it
a
woman
named
deirdre
who
lived
before
the
days
of
made
that
song
she
was
not
born
in
that
land
but
it
was
dear
to
her
because
she
dwelt
there
with
the
man
whom
she
loved
they
went
away
and
the
man
was
slain
and
where
he
was
buried
there
deirdre
cast
herself
down
and
died
his
voice
changed
and
all
the
melancholy
of
his
race
deep
wild
and
tender
looked
from
his
eyes
if
you
found
yourself
in
that
loved
land
if
this
parched
grass
were
brown
heather
if
it
stretched
down
to
a
tarn
yonder
if
that
gray
cloud
that
hath
all
the
seeming
of
a
crag
were
crag
indeed
and
eagles
plied
between
the
tarn
and
it
he
touched
her
hand
that
lay
idle
now
upon
her
knee
if
you
came
like
deirdre
lightly
through
the
heather
and
found
me
lying
here
and
found
more
red
than
should
be
in
the
tartan
of
the
macleans
what
would
you
do
truelove
what
would
you
cry
out
truelove
how
heavy
would
be
thy
heart
truelove
truelove
sat
in
silence
with
her
eyes
upon
the
sky
above
the

how
heavy
would
grow
thy
heart

the
boy

in
his
boat
the
quakeress
started
and
the
color
flamed
into
her
gentle
face
she
took
up
the
distaff
that
she
had
dropped
and
fell
to
work
again
thee
must
not
speak
to
me
so
angus
maclean
she
said
i
trust
that
my
heart
is
not
hard
thy
death
would
grieve
me
and
my
father
and
my
mother
and
ephraim
i
care
not
for
thy
father
and
mother
and
ephraim
maclean
began
impetuously
but
you
do
right
to
chide
me
once
i
knew
a
green
glen
where
maidens
were
fain
when
paused
at
their
doors

little
in

work

thy
idle

vaunting

shameless
reverence

all
its
ways
there
is
no
hatred
in
my
heart
for
this
house
which
is
its
altar
nor
for
the
priestess
of
the
altar
ah
now
you
frown
truelove
across
the
clouds
ran
so
fierce
a
line
of
gold
that
truelove
startled
put
her
hand
before
her
eyes
another
dart
of
lightning
a
low
roll
of
thunder
a
bending
apart
of
the
alder
bushes
on
the
far
side
of
the
creek
then
a
woman
voice
calling
to
the
boy
in
the
boat
to
come
ferry
her
over
who
may
that
be
asked
truelove
wonderingly
it
was
only
a
little
way
to
the
bending
alders
ephraim
rowed
across
the
glassy
water
dark
beneath
the
approach
of
the
storm
the
woman
stepped
into
the
boat
and
the
tiny
craft
came
lightly
back
to
its
haven
beneath
the
bank
it
is
darden
audrey
said
the
storekeeper
truelove
shrank
a
little
and
her
eyes
darkened
why
should
she
come
here
i
never
knew
her
it
is
true
that
we
may
not
think
evil
but
but
maclean
moved
restlessly
i
have
seen
the
girl
but
twice
he
said
once
she
was
alone
once
it
is
my
friend
of
whom
i
think
i
know
what
they
say
but
by
kattan
i
hold
him
a
gentleman
too
high
of
mind
too
noble
there
was
a
tale
i
used
to
hear
when
i
was
a
boy
a
long
long
time
ago
a
girl
lived
in
the
shadow
of
the
tower
of
duart
and
the
chief
looked
down
from
his
walls
and
saw
her
afterwards
they
walked
together
by
the
shore
and
through
the
glens
and
he
cried
her
health
when
he
drank
in
his
hall
sitting
amongst
his
tacksmen
then
what
the
men
whispered
the
women
spoke
aloud
and
so
more
quickly
than
the
tarie
is
borne
word
went
to
a
man
of
the
macdonalds
who
loved
the
duart
maiden
not
like
a
lover
to
his
tryst
did
he
come
in
the
handle
of
his
dirk
the
rich
stones
sparkled
as
they
rose
and
fell
with
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
maiden
white
bosom
she
prayed
to
die
in
his
arms
for
it
was
not
duart
that
she
loved
but
him
she
died
and
they
snooded
her
hair
and
buried
her
duart
went
overseas
the
man
of
the
macdonalds
killed
himself
it
was
all
wrought
with
threads
of
gossamer
idle
fancy
shrugs
smiles
whispers
slurring
speech
and
it
was
long
ago
but
there
is
yet
gossamer
to
be
had
for
the
gathering
it
gleams
on
every
hand
these
summer
mornings
by
now
darden
audrey
had
left
the
boat
and
was
close
upon
them
maclean
arose
and
truelove
hastily
pushed
aside
her
wheel
is
thee
seeking
shelter
from
the
storm
she
asked
tremulously
and
with
her
cheeks
as
pink
as
a
seashell
will
thee
sit
here
with
us
the
storm
will
not
break
yet
awhile
audrey
heeded
her
not
her
eyes
being
for
maclean
she
had
been
running
running
more
swiftly
than
for
a
thousand
may
day
guineas
even
now
though
her
breath
came
short
every
line
of
her
slender
figure
was
tense
and
she
was
ready
to
be
off
like
an
arrow
you
are
friend
she
cried
i
have
heard
him
say
that
you
were
so
call
you
a
brave
gentleman
maclean
dark
face
flushed
yes
we
are
friends
i
thank
god
for
it
what
have
you
to
do
with
that
my
lass
i
also
am
his
friend
said
audrey
coming
nearer
her
hands
were
clasped
her
bosom
heaving
listen
i
was
sent
on
an
errand
to
a
house
far
up
this
creek
coming
back
i
took
the
short
way
home
through
the
woods
because
of
the
storm
it
led
me
past
the
schoolhouse
down
by
the
big
swamp
i
thought
that
no
one
was
there
and
i
went
and
sat
down
upon
the
steps
to
rest
a
moment
the
door
behind
me
was
partly
open
then
i
heard
two
voices
the
schoolmaster
and
jean
hugon
were
inside
close
to
me
talking
i
would
have
run
away
but
i
heard
haward
name
her
hand
went
to
her
heart
and
she
drew
a
sobbing
breath
well
cried
maclean
sharply
haward
went
yesterday
to
williamsburgh
alone
without
juba
he
rides
back
alone
to
fair
view
late
this
afternoon
he
is
riding
now
you
know
the
sharp
bend
in
the
road
with
the
steep
bank
above
and
the
pond
below
ay
where
the
road
nears
the
river
well
i
heard
all
that
hugon
and
the
schoolmaster
said
i
hid
behind
a
fallen
tree
and
watched
them
leave
the
schoolhouse
then
i
followed
them
making
no
noise
back
to
the
creek
where
hugon
had
a
boat
they
crossed
the
creek
and
fastened
the
boat
on
this
side
i
could
follow
them
no
farther
the
woods
hid
them
but
they
have
gone
downstream
to
that
bend
in
the
road
hugon
had
his
and
pistols
the
schoolmaster
carried
a
coil
of
rope
she
flung
back
her
head
and
her
hands
went
to
her
throat
as
though
she
were
stifling
the
turn
in
the
road
is
very
sharp
just
past
the
bend
they
will
stretch
the
rope
from
side
to
side
fastening
it
to
two
trees
he
will
be
hurrying
home
before
the
bursting
of
the
storm
he
will
be
riding
the
planter
pace
man
and
horse
will
come
crashing
down
cried
the
storekeeper
with
a
great
oath
and
then
hugon
knife
so
there
will
be
no
noise
they
think
he
has
gold
upon
him
that
is
for
the
schoolmaster
hugon
is
an
indian
and
he
will
hide
their
trail
men
will
think
that
some
outlying
slave
was
in
the
woods
and
set
upon
and
killed
him
her
voice
broke
then
went
on
gathering
strength
it
was
so
late
and
i
knew
that
he
would
ride
fast
because
of
the
storm
i
remembered
this
house
and
thought
that
if
i
called
some
one
might
come
and
ferry
me
over
the
creek
now
i
will
run
through
the
woods
to
the
road
for
i
must
reach
it
before
he
passes
on
his
way
to
where
they
wait
she
turned
her
face
toward
the
pine
wood
beyond
the
house
ay
that
is
best
agreed
the
storekeeper
warned
he
can
take
the
long
way
home
and
hugon
and
this
other
may
be
dealt
with
at
his
leisure
come
my
girl
there
no
time
to
lose
they
left
behind
them
the
creek
the
blooming
dooryard
the
small
white
house
and
the
gentle
quakeress
the
woods
received
them
and
they
came
into
a
world
of
livid
greens
and
grays
dashed
here
and
there
with
ebony
a
world
that
expectant
of
the
storm
had
caught
and
was
holding
its
breath
save
for
the
noise
of
their
feet
upon
dry
leaves
that
rustled
like
paper
the
wood
was
soundless
the
light
that
lay
within
it
fallen
from
skies
of
iron
was
wild
and
sinister
there
was
no
air
and
the
heat
wrapped
them
like
a
mantle
so
motionless
were
all
things
so
fixed
in
quietude
each
branch
and
bough
each
leaf
or
twig
or
slender
needle
of
the
pine
that
they
seemed
to
be
fleeing
through
a
wood
of
stone
jade
and
malachite
emerald
and
agate
they
hurried
on
not
wasting
breath
in
speech
now
and
again
maclean
glanced
aside
at
the
girl
who
kept
beside
him
moving
as
lightly
as
presently
would
move
the
leaves
when
the
wind
arose
he
remembered
certain
scurrilous
words
spoken
in
the
store
a
week
agone
by
a
knot
of
purchasers
but
when
he
looked
at
her
face
he
thought
of
the
highland
maiden
whose
story
he
had
told
as
for
audrey
she
saw
not
the
woods
that
she
loved
heard
not
the
leaves
beneath
her
feet
knew
not
if
the
light
were
gold
or
gray
she
saw
only
a
horse
and
rider
riding
from
williamsburgh
heard
only
the
rapid
hoofbeats
all
there
was
of
her
was
one
dumb
prayer
for
the
rider
safety
her
memory
told
her
that
it
was
no
great
distance
to
the
road
but
her
heart
cried
out
that
it
was
so
far
away
so
far
away
when
the
wood
thinned
and
they
saw
before
them
the
dusty
strip
pallid
and
lonely
beneath
the
storm
clouds
her
heart
leaped
within
her
then
grew
sick
for
fear
that
he
had
gone
by
when
they
stood
in
the
dust
she
looked
first
toward
the
north
and
then
to
the
south
nothing
moved
all
was
barren
hushed
and
lonely
how
can
we
know
how
can
we
know
she
cried
and
wrung
her
hands
maclean
keen
eyes
were
busily
searching
for
any
sign
that
a
horseman
had
lately
passed
that
way
at
a
little
distance
above
them
a
shallow
stream
of
some
width
flowed
across
the
way
and
to
this
the
highlander
hastened
looked
with
attention
at
the
where
it
emerged
from
the
water
then
came
back
to
audrey
with
a
satisfied
air
there
are
no
he
said
no
marks
upon
the
dust
none
can
have
passed
for
some
hours
a
rotted
log
streaked
with
velvet
moss
and
blotched
with
fungi
lay
by
the
wayside
and
the
two
sat
down
upon
it
to
wait
for
the
coming
horseman
overhead
the
thunder
was
rolling
but
there
was
as
yet
no
breath
of
wind
no
splash
of
raindrops
opposite
them
rose
a
gigantic
pine
towering
above
the
forest
trunk
and
ultimate
cone
of
deep
green
foliage
alike
outlined
against
the
dead
gloom
of
the
sky
audrey
shook
back
her
heavy
hair
and
raised
her
face
to
the
roof
of
the
world
her
hands
were
clasped
upon
her
knee
her
bare
feet
slim
and
brown
rested
on
a
carpet
of
moss
she
was
as
still
as
the
forest
of
which
to
the
highlander
she
suddenly
seemed
a
part
when
they
had
kept
silence
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
he
spoke
to
her
with
some
hesitation
you
have
known
haward
but
a
short
while
the
months
are
very
few
since
he
came
from
england
the
name
brought
audrey
down
to
earth
again
did
you
not
know
she
asked
wonderingly
you
also
are
his
friend
you
see
him
often
i
thought
that
at
times
he
would
have
spoken
of
me
for
a
moment
her
face
was
troubled
though
only
for
a
moment
but
i
know
why
he
did
not
so
she
said
softly
to
herself
he
is
not
one
to
speak
of
his
good
deeds
she
turned
toward
maclean
who
was
attentively
watching
her
but
i
may
speak
of
them
she
said
with
pride
i
have
known
haward
for
years
and
years
he
saved
my
life
he
brought
me
here
from
the
indian
country
he
was
he
is
so
kind
to
me
since
the
afternoon
beneath
the
haward
while
encouraging
her
to
speak
of
her
long
past
her
sylvan
childhood
her
dream
memories
had
somewhat
sternly
checked
every
expression
of
gratitude
for
the
part
which
he
himself
had
played
or
was
playing
in
the
drama
of
her
life
walking
in
the
minister
orchard
sitting
in
the
garden
or
upon
the
terrace
of
fair
view
house
drifting
on
the
sunset
river
he
waved
that
aside
and
went
on
to
teach
her
another
lesson
the
teaching
was
exquisite
but
when
the
lesson
for
the
day
was
over
and
he
was
alone
he
sat
with
one
whom
he
despised
the
learning
was
exquisite
it
was
the
sweetest
song
but
she
knew
not
its
name
and
the
words
were
in
a
strange
tongue
she
was
audrey
that
she
knew
and
he
he
was
the
plumed
knight
who
for
the
lack
of
a
better
listener
told
her
gracious
tales
of
love
showed
her
how
warm
and
beautiful
was
this
world
that
she
sometimes
thought
so
sad
sang
to
her
sweet
lines
that
poets
had
made
over
and
through
all
she
thought
she
read
the
name
of
the
princess
she
had
heard
him
say
that
with
the
breaking
of
the
heat
he
should
go
to
westover
and
one
day
early
in
summer
he
had
shown
her
the
miniature
of
evelyn
byrd
because
she
loved
him
blindly
and
because
he
was
wise
in
his
generation
her
trust
in
him
was
steadfast
as
her
native
hills
large
as
her
faith
in
god
now
it
was
sweet
beneath
her
tongue
to
be
able
to
tell
one
that
was
his
friend
how
worthy
of
all
friendship
nay
all
reverence
he
was
she
spoke
simply
but
with
that
strange
power
of
expression
which
nature
had
given
her
gestures
with
her
hands
quick
changes
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
a
countenance
that
gave
ample
utterance
to
the
moment
thought
as
one
morning
in
the
fair
view
library
she
had
brought
into
being
that
long
dead
eloïsa
whose
lines
she
spoke
so
now
her
auditor
of
thought
that
he
saw
the
things
of
which
she
told
she
had
risen
and
was
standing
in
the
wild
light
against
the
background
of
the
forest
that
was
breathless
as
if
it
too
listened
and
so
he
brought
me
safely
to
this
land
she
said
and
so
he
left
me
here
for
ten
years
safe
and
happy
he
thought
he
has
told
me
that
all
that
while
he
thought
of
me
as
safe
and
happy
that
i
was
not
so
why
that
was
not
his
fault
when
he
came
back
i
was
both
i
have
never
seen
the
sunshine
so
bright
or
the
woods
so
fair
as
they
have
been
this
summer
the
people
with
whom
i
live
are
always
kind
to
me
now
that
is
his
doing
and
ah
it
is
because
he
would
not
let
hugon
scare
or
harm
me
that
that
wicked
indian
waits
for
him
now
beyond
the
bend
in
the
road
at
the
thought
of
hugon
she
shuddered
and
her
eyes
began
to
widen
have
we
not
been
here
a
long
time
she
cried
are
you
sure
oh
god
perhaps
he
has
passed
no
no
answered
maclean
with
his
hand
upon
her
arm
there
is
no
sign
that
he
has
done
so
it
is
not
late
it
is
that
heavy
cloud
above
our
heads
that
has
so
darkened
the
air
perhaps
he
has
not
left
williamsburgh
at
all
perhaps
the
storm
threatening
he
waits
until
from
the
cloud
above
came
a
blinding
light
and
a
great
crash
of
thunder
the
one
so
intense
the
other
so
tremendous
that
for
a
minute
the
two
stood
as
if
stunned
then
the
tree
cried
audrey
the
great
pine
blasted
and
afire
uprooted
itself
and
fell
from
them
like
a
reed
that
the
wind
has
snapped
the
thunder
crash
and
the
din
with
which
the
tree
met
its
fellows
of
the
forest
bore
them
down
and
finally
struck
the
earth
from
which
it
came
seemed
an
alarum
to
waken
all
nature
from
its
sleep
the
thunder
became
incessant
and
the
wind
suddenly
arising
the
forest
stretched
itself
and
began
to
speak
with
no
uncertain
voice
maclean
took
his
seat
again
upon
the
log
but
audrey
slipped
into
the
road
and
stood
in
the
whirling
dust
her
arm
raised
above
her
eyes
looking
for
the
horseman
whose
approach
she
could
not
hope
to
hear
through
the
clamor
of
the
storm
the
wind
lifted
her
long
hair
and
the
rising
dust
half
obscured
her
form
bent
against
the
blast
on
the
lonesome
road
in
the
partial
light
she
had
the
seeming
of
an
apparition
a
creature
tossed
like
a
ball
from
the
surging
forest
she
had
made
herself
a
world
and
she
had
become
its
product
in
all
her
ways
to
the
day
of
her
death
there
was
about
her
a
touch
of
mirage
illusion
fantasy
the
highlander
imaginative
like
all
his
race
and
a
believer
in
things
not
of
heaven
nor
of
earth
thought
of
spirits
of
the
glen
and
the
shore
there
was
no
rain
as
yet
only
the
of
the
forest
the
white
dust
cloud
and
the
wild
commotion
overhead
audrey
turned
to
maclean
watching
her
in
silence
he
is
coming
she
cried
there
is
some
one
with
him
now
now
he
is
safe
chapter
xv
hugon
speaks
his
mind
maclean
sprang
up
from
the
log
and
joining
her
saw
indeed
two
horsemen
galloping
toward
them
their
heads
bent
and
riding
cloaks
raised
to
shield
them
from
the
whirlwind
of
dust
dead
leaves
and
broken
twigs
he
knew
haward
powerful
steed
mirza
but
the
other
horse
was
strange
the
two
rode
fast
a
moment
and
they
were
splashing
through
the
stream
another
and
the
horses
startled
by
audrey
cry
and
waving
arms
and
by
the
sudden
and
violent
check
on
the
part
of
their
riders
were
rearing
and
curveting
across
the
road
what
the
devil
cried
one
of
the
horsemen
imp
or
sprite
or
whatever
you
are
look
out
haward
your
horse
will
trample
her
but
audrey
with
her
hand
on
mirza
bridle
had
no
fears
haward
stared
at
her
in
amazement
child
what
are
you
doing
here
angus
you
too
as
the
storekeeper
advanced
what
rendezvous
is
this
mirza
be
quiet
audrey
left
her
warning
to
be
spoken
by
maclean
she
was
at
peace
her
head
against
mirza
neck
her
eyes
upon
haward
face
clear
in
the
flashing
lightning
that
gentleman
heard
the
story
with
his
usual
calmness
his
companion
first
swore
and
then
laughed
illustration
audrey
left
her
warning
to
be
spoken
by
maclean
here
a
canterbury
tale
he
cried
egad
haward
are
we
to
take
this
skipping
rope
vault
it
as
though
we
were
courtiers
of
lilliput
neither
of
us
is
armed
i
conceive
that
the
longest
way
around
will
prove
our
shortest
way
home
my
dear
colonel
i
want
to
speak
with
these
two
gentlemen
but
at
your
leisure
my
friend
at
your
leisure
and
not
in
dying
tones
i
like
not
what
i
hear
of
monsieur
jean
hugon
pistols
flank
an
ambush
do
ride
into
it
colonel
byrd
is
right
said
the
storekeeper
earnestly
ride
back
the
two
of
you
and
take
the
bridle
path
that
will
carry
you
to
fair
view
by
way
of
the
upper
bridge
in
the
mean
time
i
will
run
through
the
woods
to
taberer
house
cross
there
hurry
to
the
quarters
rouse
the
overseer
and
with
a
man
or
two
we
will
recross
the
creek
by
the
lower
bridge
and
coming
upon
these
rogues
unawares
give
them
a
taste
of
their
own
medicine
we
hale
them
to
the
great
house
you
shall
have
speech
of
them
in
your
own
hall
neither
of
the
riders
being
able
to
suggest
a
better
plan
the
storekeeper
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
plunged
into
the
forest
and
was
soon
lost
to
view
amidst
its
serried
trunks
and
waving
branches
haward
stooped
from
his
saddle
audrey
set
her
bare
foot
upon
his
booted
one
and
he
swung
her
up
behind
him
put
thine
arm
around
me
child
he
told
her
we
will
ride
swiftly
through
the
storm
now
colonel
to
turn
our
backs
upon
the
enemy
the
lightning
was
about
them
and
they
raced
to
the
booming
of
the
thunder
heavy
raindrops
began
to
fall
and
the
wind
was
a
power
to
drive
the
riders
on
its
voice
shrilled
above
the
diapason
of
the
thunder
the
forest
swung
to
its
long
cry
when
the
horses
turned
from
the
wide
into
the
narrow
road
they
could
no
longer
go
abreast
mirza
took
the
lead
and
the
bay
fell
a
length
behind
the
branches
now
hid
the
sky
between
the
flashes
there
was
stygian
gloom
but
when
the
lightning
came
it
showed
far
aisles
of
the
forest
there
was
the
smell
of
rain
upon
dusty
earth
there
was
the
wine
of
coolness
after
heat
there
was
the
sense
of
being
borne
upon
the
wind
there
was
the
leaping
of
life
within
the
veins
to
meet
the
awakened
life
without
audrey
closed
her
eyes
and
wished
to
ride
thus
forever
haward
too
traveling
fast
through
mist
and
rain
a
road
whose
end
was
hidden
facing
the
wet
wind
hearing
the
voices
of
earth
and
sky
felt
his
spirit
mount
with
the
mounting
voices
so
to
ride
with
love
to
doom
on
and
on
and
on
left
behind
the
sophist
the
apologist
the
lover
of
the
world
with
his
tinsel
that
was
not
gold
his
pebbles
that
were
not
gems
only
the
man
thundering
on
the
man
and
his
mate
that
was
meant
for
him
since
time
began
he
raised
his
face
to
the
strife
above
he
drew
his
breath
his
hand
closed
over
the
hand
of
the
woman
riding
with
him
at
the
touch
a
thrill
ran
through
them
both
had
the
lightning
with
a
sword
of
flame
cut
the
world
from
beneath
their
feet
they
had
passed
on
immortal
in
their
happiness
but
the
bolts
struck
aimlessly
and
the
moment
fled
haward
was
haward
again
he
recognized
his
old
acquaintance
with
a
smile
the
road
was
no
longer
a
road
that
gleamed
athwart
all
time
and
space
the
wind
had
lost
its
trumpet
tone
love
spoke
not
in
the
thunder
nor
seemed
so
high
a
thing
as
the
lit
heaven
audrey
hand
was
yet
within
his
clasp
but
it
was
flesh
and
blood
that
he
touched
not
spirit
and
he
was
glad
that
it
was
so
for
her
her
cheek
burned
and
she
hid
her
eyes
she
had
looked
unawares
as
by
the
lightning
glare
into
a
world
of
which
she
had
not
dreamed
its
portals
had
shut
she
rode
on
in
the
twilight
again
and
she
could
not
clearly
remember
what
she
had
seen
but
she
was
sure
that
the
air
of
that
country
was
sweet
she
was
faint
with
its
beauty
her
heart
beat
with
violence
to
its
far
echoes
moreover
she
was
dimly
aware
that
in
the
moment
when
she
had
looked
there
had
been
a
baptism
she
had
thought
of
herself
as
a
child
as
a
girl
now
and
for
evermore
she
was
a
woman
they
left
the
forest
behind
and
came
to
open
fields
where
the
tobacco
had
been
beaten
to
earth
the
trees
now
stood
singly
or
in
shivering
copses
above
the
heavens
were
bare
to
their
gaze
and
the
lightning
gave
glimpses
of
pale
castles
overhanging
fathomless
abysses
the
road
widened
and
the
bay
was
pushed
by
its
rider
to
mirza
side
fields
of
corn
where
the
long
blades
wildly
clashed
a
wood
of
dripping
cedars
a
patch
of
oronoko
tobacco
house
in
midst
rising
ground
and
a
vision
of
the
river
then
a
swift
descent
to
the
lower
creek
and
the
bridge
across
which
lay
the
road
that
ran
to
the
minister
house
audrey
spoke
earnestly
to
the
master
of
fair
view
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
drew
rein
we
will
not
cross
colonel
he
declared
my
preserver
will
have
it
that
she
has
troubled
us
long
enough
and
indeed
it
is
no
great
distance
to
the
glebe
house
and
the
rain
has
stopped
have
down
with
thee
then
obstinate
one
audrey
slipped
to
the
earth
and
pushed
back
her
hair
from
her
eyes
colonel
byrd
observed
her
curiously
faith
he
exclaimed
is
the
atalanta
of
last
may
day
well
child
i
believe
thou
hast
saved
our
lives
come
here
are
three
gold
baubles
that
may
pass
for
apples
audrey
put
her
hands
behind
her
i
want
no
money
sir
what
i
did
was
a
gift
it
has
no
price
she
was
only
darden
audrey
but
she
spoke
as
proudly
as
a
princess
might
have
spoken
haward
smiled
to
hear
her
and
seeing
the
smile
she
was
comforted
for
he
understands
she
said
to
herself
he
would
never
hurt
me
so
it
did
not
wound
her
that
he
said
no
word
but
only
lifted
his
hat
when
she
curtsied
to
them
both
there
was
and
he
would
praise
her
then
for
her
quickness
of
wit
and
her
courage
in
following
hugon
whom
she
feared
so
much
the
riders
watched
her
cross
the
bridge
and
turn
into
the
road
that
led
to
the
glebe
house
then
kept
their
own
road
in
silence
until
it
brought
them
to
the
doors
of
fair
view
it
was
an
hour
later
and
drawing
toward
dusk
when
the
colonel
having
changed
his
wet
riding
clothes
for
a
suit
of
his
friend
came
down
the
stairs
and
entered
the
fair
view
haward
in
green
with
rich
lace
at
throat
and
wrist
was
there
before
him
walking
up
and
down
in
the
cheerful
light
of
a
fire
kindled
against
the
dampness
no
sign
of
our
men
he
said
as
the
other
entered
come
to
the
fire
faith
colonel
my
russet
and
gold
becomes
you
mightily
juba
took
you
the
aqua
vitæ
ay
in
one
of
your
great
silver
goblets
with
a
forest
of
mint
atop
ha
this
is
comfort
he
sank
into
an
armchair
stretched
his
legs
before
the
blaze
and
began
to
look
about
him
i
have
ever
said
haward
that
of
all
the
gentlemen
of
my
acquaintance
you
have
the
most
exact
taste
i
told
bubb
dodington
as
much
last
year
at
eastbury
damask
mirrors
paintings
china
cabinets
all
chaste
and
quiet
extremely
elegant
but
without
ostentation
it
hath
an
air
too
i
would
swear
a
woman
had
the
placing
of
yonder
painted
jars
you
are
right
said
haward
smiling
the
wife
of
the
minister
of
this
parish
was
good
enough
to
come
to
my
assistance
ah
said
the
colonel
dryly
did
atalanta
come
as
well
she
is
his
reverence
servant
is
she
not
no
answered
haward
shortly
to
the
last
question
and
leaning
across
stirred
the
fire
the
light
caused
to
sparkle
a
jeweled
pin
worn
in
the
lace
of
his
ruffles
and
the
toy
caught
the
colonel
eye
one
of
spotswood
golden
horseshoes
he
exclaimed
i
had
them
wrought
for
him
in
london
had
they
been
so
many
stars
and
garters
he
could
have
made
no
greater
pother
is
ten
years
since
i
saw
one
haward
detached
the
bauble
from
the
lace
and
laid
it
on
the
other
palm
the
master
of
westover
regarded
it
curiously
and
read
aloud
the
motto
engraved
upon
its
back
juvat
transcendere
montes
a
barren
exploit
but
some
day
i
too
shall
please
myself
and
cross
these
hills
and
so
the
maid
with
the
eyes
is
not
his
servant
what
is
she
haward
took
the
golden
horseshoe
in
his
own
hand
and
fell
to
studying
it
in
the
firelight
i
wore
this
he
said
at
length
with
deliberation
in
order
that
it
might
bring
to
your
mind
that
sprightly
ultramontane
expedition
in
which
my
dear
colonel
had
you
not
been
in
england
you
had
undoubtedly
borne
a
part
you
have
asked
me
a
question
i
will
answer
it
with
a
story
and
so
the
time
may
pass
more
rapidly
until
the
arrival
of
maclean
with
our
friends
who
set
traps
he
turned
the
mimic
horseshoe
this
way
and
that
watching
the
small
gems
that
simulated
nails
flash
in
the
red
light
some
days
to
the
west
of
germanna
he
said
when
about
us
were
the
lesser
mountains
and
before
us
those
that
propped
the
sky
we
came
one
sunny
noon
upon
a
valley
a
little
valley
very
peaceful
below
the
heights
a
stream
shone
through
it
and
there
were
noble
trees
and
beside
the
stream
the
cabin
of
a
frontiersman
on
went
the
story
the
fire
crackled
reflecting
itself
in
mirrors
and
polished
wood
and
many
small
window
panes
outside
the
rain
had
ceased
but
the
wind
and
the
river
murmured
loudly
and
the
shadows
of
the
night
were
gathering
when
the
narrative
was
ended
he
who
had
spoken
and
he
who
had
listened
sat
staring
at
the
fire
a
pretty
story
said
the
colonel
at
last
dick
steele
should
have
had
it
have
looked
vastly
well
over
against
his
inkle
and
yarico
there
the
maid
the
savior
here
the
man
there
perfidy
here
plain
honesty
there
for
the
woman
a
fate
most
tragical
here
here
said
haward
as
the
other
paused
the
master
of
westover
took
out
his
snuffbox
and
here
the
continued
kindness
of
a
young
and
handsome
preserver
he
said
suavely
and
extended
the
box
to
his
host
you
are
mistaken
said
haward
he
rose
and
stood
leaning
against
the
mantel
his
eyes
upon
the
older
man
somewhat
coldly
smiling
countenance
she
is
as
innocent
as
high
of
soul
and
as
pure
of
heart
as
as
evelyn
the
colonel
clicked
to
the
lid
of
his
box
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
leave
my
daughter
name
out
of
the
conversation
as
you
please
haward
answered
with
hauteur
another
silence
broken
by
the
guest
why
did
you
hang
that
of
yourself
behind
the
door
haward
he
asked
amiably
is
too
fine
a
piece
to
be
lost
in
shadow
i
would
advise
a
change
with
yonder
shepherdess
i
do
not
know
why
said
haward
restlessly
a
whim
perhaps
by
nature
i
court
shadows
and
dark
corners
that
is
not
so
byrd
replied
quietly
he
had
turned
in
his
chair
the
better
to
observe
the
distant
portrait
that
was
now
lightened
now
darkened
as
the
flames
rose
and
fell
a
speaking
likeness
he
went
on
glancing
from
it
to
the
original
and
back
again
i
ever
thought
it
one
of
kneller
best
the
portrait
of
a
gentleman
only
you
have
noticed
i
dare
say
how
in
the
firelight
familiar
objects
change
aspect
many
times
only
just
now
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
lost
that
distinction
well
said
haward
as
he
paused
the
colonel
went
on
slowly
lost
that
distinction
and
became
the
portrait
of
well
of
whom
asked
haward
and
with
his
eyes
shaded
by
his
hand
gazed
not
at
the
portrait
but
at
the
connoisseur
in
gold
and
russet
of
a
dirty
tradesman
said
the
master
of
westover
lightly
in
a
word
of
an
own
brother
to
thomas
inkle
a
dead
silence
then
haward
spoke
calmly
i
will
not
take
offense
colonel
byrd
perhaps
i
should
not
take
it
even
were
it
not
as
my
guest
and
in
my
that
you
have
so
spoken
we
will
if
you
please
consign
my
portrait
to
the
obscurity
from
which
it
has
been
dragged
in
good
time
here
comes
juba
to
light
the
candles
and
set
the
shadows
fleeing
leaving
the
fire
he
moved
to
a
window
and
stood
looking
out
upon
the
windy
twilight
from
the
back
of
the
house
came
a
sound
of
voices
and
of
footsteps
the
colonel
put
up
his
snuffbox
and
brushed
a
grain
from
his
ruffles
enter
two
murderers
he
said
briskly
will
you
have
them
here
haward
or
shall
we
go
into
the
hall
light
all
the
candles
juba
ordered
the
master
here
i
think
colonel
where
the
stage
will
set
them
off
juba
go
ask
maclean
and
saunderson
to
bring
their
prisoners
here
as
he
spoke
he
turned
from
the
contemplation
of
the
night
without
to
the
brightly
lit
room
this
is
a
murderous
fellow
this
hugon
he
said
as
he
took
his
seat
in
a
great
chair
drawn
before
a
table
i
have
heard
colonel
byrd
argue
in
favor
of
imitating
john
rolfe
early
experiment
and
marrying
the
white
man
to
the
heathen
we
are
about
to
behold
the
result
of
such
an
union
i
would
not
have
the
practice
universal
said
the
colonel
coolly
but
go
far
toward
remedying
loss
of
scalps
in
this
world
and
of
infidel
souls
hereafter
your
sprightly
lover
is
a
most
prevailing
missionary
but
here
is
our
maclean
very
wet
and
muddy
with
one
hand
wrapped
in
a
rag
came
in
first
we
found
them
hidden
in
the
bushes
at
the
turn
of
the
road
he
said
hastily
the
schoolmaster
was
more
peaceably
inclined
than
any
quaker
but
hugon
fought
like
the
wolf
that
he
is
ca
you
hang
him
out
of
hand
haward
give
me
a
land
where
the
chief
does
justice
while
the
king
looks
the
other
way
he
turned
and
beckoned
bring
them
in
saunderson
there
was
no
discomposure
in
the
schoolmaster
dress
and
as
little
in
his
face
or
manner
he
bowed
to
the
two
gentlemen
then
shambled
across
to
the
fire
and
as
best
he
could
held
out
his
bound
hands
to
the
grateful
blaze
may
i
ask
sir
he
said
in
his
lifeless
voice
why
it
is
that
this
youth
and
i
resting
in
all
peace
and
quietness
beside
a
public
road
should
be
set
upon
by
your
servants
overpowered
bound
and
haled
to
your
house
as
to
a
judgment
bar
haward
to
whom
this
speech
was
addressed
gave
it
no
attention
his
gaze
was
upon
hugon
who
in
his
turn
glared
at
him
alone
haward
had
a
subtle
power
of
forcing
and
fixing
the
attention
of
a
company
in
crowded
rooms
without
undue
utterance
or
moving
from
his
place
he
was
apt
to
achieve
the
centre
of
the
stage
the
head
of
the
table
now
the
by
very
virtue
of
the
passion
which
false
to
his
indian
blood
shook
him
like
a
leaf
of
a
rage
which
overmastered
and
transformed
reached
at
a
bound
the
englishman
plane
of
distinction
his
great
wig
of
a
fashion
years
gone
by
was
pulled
grotesquely
aside
showing
the
high
forehead
and
shaven
crown
beneath
his
laced
coat
and
tawdry
waistcoat
and
ruffled
shirt
were
torn
and
foul
with
mud
and
mould
but
the
man
himself
made
to
be
forgotten
the
absurdity
of
his
trappings
gone
for
him
were
his
captors
his
accomplice
the
spectator
in
gold
and
russet
to
haward
also
sitting
very
cold
very
quiet
with
narrowed
eyes
they
were
gone
he
was
angered
and
in
the
mood
to
give
rein
after
his
own
fashion
to
that
anger
maclean
and
the
master
of
westover
the
overseer
and
the
schoolmaster
were
forgotten
and
he
and
hugon
met
alone
as
they
might
have
met
in
the
forest
between
them
and
without
a
spoken
word
the
two
made
this
fact
to
be
recognized
by
the
other
occupants
of
the
colonel
byrd
who
had
been
standing
with
his
hand
upon
the
table
moved
backward
until
he
joined
maclean
beside
the
closed
door
saunderson
drew
near
to
the
schoolmaster
and
the
centre
of
the
room
was
left
to
the
murderer
and
the
victim
that
had
escaped
him
monsieur
le
monacan
said
haward
hugon
snarled
like
an
angry
wolf
and
strained
at
the
rope
which
bound
his
arms
haward
went
on
evenly
your
tribe
has
smoked
the
peace
pipe
with
the
white
man
i
was
not
told
it
by
singing
birds
but
by
the
great
white
father
at
williamsburgh
they
buried
the
hatchet
very
deep
the
dead
leaves
of
many
moons
of
cohonks
lie
thick
upon
the
place
where
they
buried
it
why
have
you
made
a
warpath
treading
it
alone
of
your
color
diable
cried
hugon
pig
of
an
englishman
i
will
kill
you
for
for
an
handful
of
blue
beads
said
haward
with
a
cold
smile
and
i
dog
of
an
indian
i
will
send
a
nottoway
to
teach
the
monacans
how
to
lay
a
snare
and
hide
a
trail
the
trader
gasping
with
passion
leaned
across
the
table
until
his
eyes
were
within
a
foot
of
haward
unmoved
face
who
showed
you
the
trail
and
told
you
of
the
snare
he
whispered
tell
me
that
you
englishman
tell
me
that
a
storm
bird
said
haward
calmly
okee
is
perhaps
angry
with
his
monacans
and
sent
it
was
it
audrey
haward
laughed
no
it
was
not
audrey
and
so
monacan
you
have
yourself
fallen
into
the
pit
which
you
digged
from
the
fireplace
came
the
schoolmaster
slow
voice
dear
sir
can
you
show
the
pit
why
should
this
youth
desire
to
harm
you
where
is
the
storm
bird
can
you
whistle
it
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
or
into
a
court
room
if
haward
heard
it
did
not
appear
he
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
trader
twitching
face
in
a
cold
and
smiling
regard
well
monacan
he
demanded
the
straightened
himself
and
with
a
mighty
effort
strove
in
vain
for
a
composure
that
should
match
the
other
cold
a
command
which
taunted
and
stung
now
at
this
point
now
at
that
i
am
a
frenchman
he
cried
in
a
voice
that
broke
with
passion
i
am
of
the
noblesse
of
the
land
of
france
which
is
a
country
that
is
much
grander
than
virginia
old
pierre
at
told
me
these
things
my
father
changed
his
name
when
he
came
across
the
sea
so
i
bear
not
the
which
is
a
sign
of
a
great
man
listen
you
englishman
i
trade
i
prosper
i
buy
me
land
i
begin
to
build
me
a
house
there
is
a
girl
that
i
see
every
hour
every
minute
while
i
am
building
it
she
says
she
loves
me
not
but
nevertheless
i
shall
wed
her
now
i
see
her
in
this
room
now
in
that
she
comes
down
the
stair
she
smiles
at
the
window
she
stands
on
the
doorstep
to
welcome
me
when
i
come
home
from
my
hunting
and
trading
in
the
woods
so
far
away
i
bring
her
fine
skins
of
the
otter
the
beaver
and
the
fawn
beadwork
also
from
the
villages
and
bracelets
of
copper
and
pearl
the
flowers
bloom
around
her
and
my
heart
sings
to
see
her
upon
my
doorstep
the
flowers
are
dead
and
you
have
stolen
the
girl
away
there
was
a
stream
and
the
sun
shone
upon
it
and
you
and
she
were
in
a
boat
i
walked
alone
upon
the
bank
and
in
my
heart
i
left
building
my
house
and
fell
to
other
work
you
laughed
one
day
you
will
laugh
no
more
that
was
many
suns
ago
i
have
watched
foam
was
upon
his
lips
and
he
strained
without
ceasing
at
his
bonds
already
pulled
far
awry
his
great
peruke
a
cataract
of
hair
streaming
over
his
shoulders
shading
and
softening
the
swarthy
features
between
its
curled
waves
now
slipped
from
his
head
and
fell
to
the
floor
the
change
which
its
absence
wrought
was
startling
of
the
man
the
moiety
that
was
white
disappeared
the
shaven
head
its
poise
its
features
were
indian
the
soul
was
indian
and
looked
from
indian
eyes
suddenly
for
the
last
transforming
touch
came
a
torrent
of
words
in
a
strange
tongue
the
tongue
of
his
mother
of
what
he
was
speaking
what
he
was
threatening
no
one
of
them
could
tell
he
was
a
savage
giving
voice
to
madness
and
hate
haward
pushed
back
his
chair
from
the
table
and
rising
walked
across
the
room
to
the
window
hugon
followed
him
straining
at
the
rope
about
his
arms
and
speaking
thickly
his
eyes
were
glaring
his
teeth
bared
when
he
was
so
close
that
the
virginian
could
feel
his
hot
breath
the
latter
turned
and
uttering
an
oath
of
disgust
struck
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
lips
with
the
cry
of
an
animal
hugon
bound
as
he
was
threw
himself
bodily
upon
his
foe
who
in
his
turn
flung
the
trader
from
him
with
a
violence
that
sent
him
reeling
against
the
wall
here
saunderson
a
man
of
powerful
build
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
holding
him
fast
maclean
too
hurriedly
crossed
from
the
door
there
was
no
need
for
the
frenzy
was
spent
he
stood
with
glittering
eyes
following
haward
every
motion
but
quite
silent
his
frame
rigid
in
the
overseer
grasp
colonel
byrd
went
up
to
haward
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
best
send
them
at
once
to
williamsburgh
haward
shook
his
head
i
can
not
he
said
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
there
is
no
proof
no
proof
exclaimed
his
guest
sharply
you
mean
the
other
met
his
stare
of
surprise
with
an
imperturbable
countenance
what
i
say
he
answered
quietly
my
servants
find
two
men
lurking
beside
a
road
that
i
am
traveling
being
somewhat
they
take
them
up
upon
suspicion
of
meaning
mischief
and
bring
them
before
me
it
is
all
guesswork
why
they
were
at
the
turn
of
the
road
and
what
they
wanted
there
there
is
no
proof
no
witness
i
see
that
there
is
no
witness
that
you
care
to
call
said
the
colonel
coldly
haward
waved
his
hand
there
is
no
witness
he
said
without
change
of
tone
and
therefore
colonel
i
am
about
to
dismiss
the
case
with
a
slight
bow
to
his
guest
he
left
the
window
and
advanced
to
the
group
in
the
centre
of
the
room
saunderson
he
said
abruptly
take
these
two
men
to
the
quarter
and
cut
their
bonds
give
them
a
start
of
fifty
yards
then
loose
the
dogs
and
hunt
them
from
the
plantation
you
have
men
outside
to
help
you
very
well
go
maclean
will
you
see
this
chase
fairly
started
the
highlander
who
had
become
very
thoughtful
of
aspect
since
entering
the
room
and
who
had
not
shared
saunderson
start
of
surprise
at
the
master
latest
orders
nodded
assent
haward
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
steadily
at
hugon
but
with
no
notice
to
bestow
upon
the
bowing
schoolmaster
then
walked
over
to
the
harpsichord
and
sitting
down
began
to
play
an
old
tune
soft
and
slow
with
pauses
between
the
notes
when
he
came
to
the
final
chord
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
colonel
standing
before
the
mantel
with
his
eyes
upon
the
fire
so
they
have
gone
he
said
good
riddance
a
pretty
brace
of
villains
i
should
be
loath
to
have
monsieur
jean
hugon
for
my
enemy
said
the
colonel
gravely
haward
laughed
i
was
told
at
williamsburgh
that
a
party
of
traders
go
to
the
southern
indians
and
he
with
them
perhaps
a
month
or
two
of
the
woods
will
work
a
cure
he
fell
to
playing
again
a
quiet
plaintive
air
when
it
was
ended
he
rose
and
went
over
to
the
fire
to
keep
his
guest
company
but
finding
him
in
a
mood
for
silence
presently
fell
silent
himself
and
took
to
viewing
structures
of
his
own
building
in
the
red
hollows
between
the
logs
this
mutual
taciturnity
lasted
until
the
announcement
of
supper
and
was
relapsed
into
at
intervals
during
the
meal
but
when
they
had
returned
to
the
the
two
talked
until
it
was
late
and
the
fire
had
sunken
to
ash
and
embers
before
they
parted
for
the
night
it
was
agreed
that
the
master
of
westover
should
remain
with
the
master
of
fair
view
for
a
day
or
so
at
the
end
of
which
time
the
latter
gentleman
would
accompany
the
former
to
westover
for
a
visit
of
indefinite
length

to
the
southern

had
lately
returned
to
his
lair
at
the
crossroads

when
upon
a
sunny
september
morning
audrey
and
mistress
deborah
mounted
upon
the
sorriest
of
darden
sorry
steeds
turned
from
duke
of
gloucester
into
palace
street
they
had
parted
with
the
minister
before
his
favorite
ordinary
and
were
on
their
way
to
the
house
where
they
themselves
were
to
lodge
during
the
three
days
of
town
life
which
darden
had
vouchsafed
to
offer
them
for
a
month
or
more
virginia
had
been
wearing
black
ribbons
for
the
king
who
died
in
june
but
in
the
last
day
or
so
there
had
been
a
reversion
to
bright
colors
this
cheerful
change
had
been
wrought
by
the
arrival
in
the
york
of
the
fortune
of
bristol
with
the
new
governor
on
board
his
excellency
had
landed
at
yorktown
and
after
suitable
entertainment
at
the
hands
of
its
citizens
had
proceeded
under
escort
to
williamsburgh
the
entry
into
the
town
was
triumphal
and
when
at
the
doorway
of
his
palace
the
governor
turned
and
addressed
a
pleasing
oration
to
the
people
whom
he
was
to
rule
in
the
name
of
the
king
and
my
lord
of
orkney
enthusiasm
reached
its
height
at
night
the
town
was
illuminated
and
all
its
ladies
and
gentlemen
visited
the
palace
in
order
to
pay
their
duty
to
its
latest
occupant
it
was
a
people
and
the
arrival
of
a
governor
an
occasion
of
which
the
most
must
be
made
gentlemen
of
consideration
had
come
in
from
every
county
bringing
with
them
wives
and
daughters
in
the
mild
sunshiny
weather
the
crowded
town
overflowed
into
square
and
street
and
garden
everywhere
were
bustle
and
gayety
gayety
none
the
less
for
the
presence
of
thirty
or
more
ministers
of
the
established
church
for
commissary
blair
had
convoked
a
meeting
of
the
clergy
for
the
consideration
of
evils
affecting
that
body
not
alas
from
without
alone
the
governor
arriving
so
opportunely
must
too
be
addressed
upon
the
usual
subjects
of
presentation
induction
and
vestries
it
was
fitting
also
that
the
college
of
william
and
mary
should
have
its
say
upon
the
occasion
and
the
brightest
scholar
thereof
was
even
now
closeted
with
the
latin
master
that
the
copy
of
verses
giving
the
welcome
of
so
many
future
planters
burgesses
and
members
of
council
would
be
choice
in
thought
and
elegant
in
expression
there
could
be
no
reasonable
doubt
the
council
was
to
give
an
entertainment
at
the
capitol
one
day
had
been
set
aside
for
a
muster
of
militia
in
the
meadow
beyond
the
college
another
for
a
great
many
small
parties
were
arranged
and
last
but
not
least
on
the
night
of
the
day
following
darden
appearance
in
town
his
excellency
was
to
give
a
ball
at
the
palace
add
to
all
this
that
two
notorious
pirates
were
standing
their
trial
before
a
with
every
prospect
of
being
hanged
within
the
that
a
deputation
of
nottoways
and
meherrins
having
business
with
the
white
fathers
in
williamsburgh
were
to
be
persuaded
to
dance
their
wildest
whoop
their
loudest
around
a
bonfire
built
in
the
market
square
that
at
the
playhouse
cato
was
to
be
given
with
extraordinary
magnificence
and
one
may
readily
see
that
there
might
have
been
found
in
this
sunny
september
week
places
less
entertaining
than

plodded
along

that
led
to

the
palace
of

was
not

instead
when
they
had
crossed

street
they
drew
up
before
a
particularly
small
white
house
so
hidden
away
behind
lilac
bushes
and
trellised
grapevines
that
it
gave
but
here
and
there
a
pale
hint
of
its
existence
it
was
planted
in
the
shadow
of
a
larger
building
and
a
path
led
around
it
to
what
seemed
a
pleasant
shady
and
extensive

running
from

two
years
ago

i
spent
with

in
the
both
of

and
a
bottle
of
madeira
audrey
fastened
the
horse
against
the
time
that
darden
should
remember
to
send
for
it
and
then
followed
the
and
the
former
queen
of
a
company
of
strollers
up
a
grassy
path
and
through
a
little
green
door
into
a
pleasant
room
where
grape
leaves
wreathed
the
windows
and
cast
their
shadows
upon
a
sanded
floor
at
one
end
of
the
room
stood
a
great
rudely
built
cabinet
and
before
it
a
long
table
strewn
with
an
orderly
litter
of
such
slender
articles
of
apparel
as
silk
and
tissue
scarfs
gauze
hoods
breast
knots
silk
stockings
and
embroidered
gloves
mistress
deborah
must
needs
run
and
examine
these
at
once
and
mistress
mary
stagg
wife
of
the
lessee
manager
and
principal
actor
of
the
williamsburgh
theatre
looked
complacently
over
her
shoulder
the
minister
wife
sighed
again
this
time
with
envy
what
with
the
theatre
and
the
bowling
green
and
tea
in
your
and
dancing
lessons
and
the
sale
of
these
fine
things
you
and
charles
must
turn
a
pretty
penny
the
luck
that
some
folk
have
were
always
fortunate
mary
mistress
stagg
did
not
deny
the
imputation
but
she
was
a
kindly
soul
who
had
not
forgotten
the
gift
of
my
lady
squander
pink
alamode
the
chocolate
stain
had
not
been
so
very
large
i
laid
by
a
pretty
piece
of
sarcenet
of
which
to
make
you
a
capuchin
she
said
promptly
now
here
the
wine
sha
we
go
into
the
garden
and
sip
it
there
peggy
to
the
black
girl
holding
a
salver
put
the
cake
and
wine
on
the
table
in
the
arbor
then
sit
here
by
the
window
and
call
me
if
any
come
my
dear
deborah
i
doubt
if
i
have
so
much
as
a
ribbon
left
by
the
end
of
the
week
the
town
is
that
gay
i
says
to
mirabell
this
morning
says
i
my
dear
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
bath
and
mirabell
says
but
here
the
garden
door
now
is
it
cool
and
pleasant
out
here
audrey
may
gather
us
some
grapes
yes
very
fine
full
bunches
it
has
been
a
bounteous
year
the
grape
arbor
hugged
the
house
but
beyond
it
was
a
pretty
shady
fancifully
laid
out
garden
with
walks
a
grotto
a
and
a
gate
opening
into
nicholson
street
beyond
the
garden
a
glimpse
was
to
be
caught
through
the
trees
of
a
trim
bowling
green
it
had
rained
the
night
before
and
a
delightful
almost
vernal
freshness
breathed
in
the
air
the
bees
made
a
great
buzzing
amongst
the
grapes
and
the
birds
in
the
sang
as
though
it
were
nesting
time
mistress
stagg
and
her
old
acquaintance
sat
at
a
table
placed
in
the
shadow
of
the
vines
and
sipped
their
wine
while
audrey
obediently
gathered
clusters
of
the
purple
fruit
and
thought
the
garden
very
fine
but
oh
not
like
there
could
be
no
garden
in
the
world
so
beautiful
and
so
dear
as
that
and
she
had
not
seen
it
for
so
long
so
long
a
time
she
wondered
if
she
would
ever
see
it
again
when
she
brought
the
fruit
to
the
table
mistress
stagg
made
room
for
her
kindly
enough
and
she
sat
and
drank
her
wine
and
went
to
her
world
of
dreams
while
her
companions
bartered
town
and
country
gossip
it
has
been
said
that
the
small
white
house
adjoined
a
larger
building
a
window
in
this
structure
which
had
much
the
appearance
of
a
barn
was
now
opened
with
the
result
that
a
confused
sound
as
of
several
people
speaking
at
once
made
itself
heard
suddenly
the
noise
gave
place
to
a
single
voice
my
son
here
lay
him
down
my
friends
full
in
my
sight
that
i
may
view
at
leisure
the
bloody
corse
and
count
those
glorious
wounds
a
smile
irradiated
mistress
stagg
faded
countenance
and
she
blew
a
kiss
toward
the
open
window
he
does
cato
so
extremely
well
and
it
a
grave
dull
odd
character
too
but
mirabell
that
charles
you
know
manages
to
put
a
little
life
in
it
a
ne
sais
a
touch
of
sir
harry
wildair
now
now
he
pulling
out
his
laced
handkerchief
to
weep
over
rome
you
should
see
him
after
he
has
fallen
on
his
sword
and
is
brought
on
in
a
chair
all
over
blood
this
is
the
third
rehearsal
the
ordered
for
monday
night
who
is
it
peggy
madam
travis
it
about
the
lace
for
her
damask
petticoat
and
there
no
telling
how
long
she
may
keep
me
my
dear
deborah
when
you
have
finished
your
wine
peggy
shall
show
you
your
room
you
must
make
yourself
quite
at
home
for
says
i
to
mirabell
this
morning
be
it
from
me
to
forget
past
kindnesses
and
in
those
old
bath
days
deborah
was
a
good
friend
to
me
which
was
no
wonder
to
be
sure
seeing
that
when
we
were
little
girls
we
went
to
the
same
dame
school
and
always
learned
our
book
and
worked
our
samplers
together
and
says
mirabell
yes
yes
i
coming
she
disappeared
and
the
black
girl
showed
the
two
guests
through
the
hall
and
up
a
tiny
stairway
into
a
little
whitewashed
room
mistress
deborah
who
still
wore
remnants
of
my
lady
squander
ancient
gifts
of
spoiled
finery
had
likewise
failed
to
discard
the
airs
acquired
during
her
service
she
now
declared
herself
excessively
tired
by
her
morning
ride
and
martyr
besides
to
a
migraine
moreover
it
was
enough
to
give
one
the
spleen
to
hear
mary
stagg
magpie
chatter
and
to
see
how
some
folk
throve
while
others
just
as
good
here
tears
of
vexation
ensued
and
she
must
lie
down
upon
the
bed
and
call
in
a
feeble
voice
for
her
smelling
salts
audrey
hurriedly
searched
in
the
ragged
portmanteau
brought
to
town
the
day
before
in
the
of
an
obliging
parishioner
found
the
flask
and
took
it
to
the
bedside
to
receive
in
exchange
a
sound
box
of
the
ear
for
her
tardiness
the
blow
reddened
her
cheek
but
brought
no
tears
to
her
eyes
it
was
too
small
a
thing
to
weep
for
tears
were
for
blows
upon
the
heart
it
was
a
cool
and
quiet
little
room
and
mistress
deborah
who
had
drunk
two
full
glasses
of
the
madeira
presently
fell
asleep
audrey
sat
very
still
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
and
her
eyes
upon
them
until
their
hostess
voice
announced
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
that
madam
travis
had
taken
her
departure
she
then
slipped
from
the
room
and
was
affably
received
below
and
taken
into
the
apartment
which
they
had
first
entered
here
mistress
became
at
once
extremely
busy
a
fan
was
to
be
mounted
yards
of
silk
gathered
into
furbelows
breast
knots
shoulder
knots
sword
knots
to
be
made
up
her
customers
were
all
people
of
quality
and
unless
she
did
her
part
not
one
of
them
could
go
to
the
ball
audrey
shyly
proffered
her
aid
and
was
set
to
changing
the
ribbons
upon
a
mask
mistress
stagg
tongue
went
as
fast
as
her
needle
and
deborah
is
asleep
poor
soul
she
sadly
changed
from
what
she
was
in
old
england
thirteen
years
ago
as
neat
a
shape
as
you
would
see
in
a
day
journey
with
the
prettiest
color
and
eyes
as
bright
as
those
marcasite
buttons
and
she
saw
the
best
of
company
at
my
lady
squander
no
lack
there
of
kisses
and
guineas
and
fine
gentlemen
you
may
be
sure
there
a
deal
of
change
in
this
mortal
world
and
it
generally
for
the
worse
here
child
you
may
whip
this
lace
on
lightfoot
ruffles
i
think
myself
lucky
i
can
tell
you
that
there
are
so
few
women
in
cato
if
so
i
should
have
to
go
on
myself
for
since
poor
dear
pretty
jane
day
died
of
the
smallpox
and
oriana
jordan
ran
away
with
the
rascally
bridewell
fellow
that
we
bought
to
play
husbands
parts
and
was
never
heard
of
more
but
is
supposed
to
have
gotten
clean
off
to
barbadoes
by
favor
of
the
master
of
the
lady
susan
we
have
been
short
of
actresses
but
in
this
play
there
are
only
marcia
and
lucia
is
extremely
fortunate
my
dear
said
i
to
mirabell
this
very
morning
in
this
play
which
is
the
proper
compliment
to
a
great
gentleman
just
taking
office
addison
should
have
put
no
more
than
two
women
and
mirabell
says
do
put
the
lace
so
full
child
go
round
a
chair
is
stopping
at
the
gate
said
audrey
who
sat
by
the
window
there
a
lady
in
it
the
chair
was
a
very
fine
painted
one
borne
by
two
gayly
dressed
negroes
and
escorted
by
a
trio
of
beribboned
young
gentlemen
prodigal
of
gallant
speeches
amorous
sighs
and
languishing
glances
mistress
stagg
looked
started
up
and
without
waiting
to
raise
from
the
floor
the
armful
of
delicate
silk
which
she
had
dropped
was
presently
curtsying
upon
the
doorstep
the
bearers
set
down
their
load
one
of
the
gentlemen
opened
the
chair
door
with
a
flourish
and
the
divinity
compressing
her
hoop
descended
a
second
cavalier
flung
back
mistress
stagg
gate
and
the
third
with
a
low
bow
proffered
his
hand
to
conduct
the
fair
from
the
gate
to
the
doorstep
the
lady
shook
her
head
a
smiling
word
or
two
a
slight
curtsy
the
wave
of
a
painted
fan
and
her
attendants
found
themselves
dismissed
she
came
up
the
path
alone
slowly
with
her
head
a
little
bent
audrey
watching
her
from
the
window
knew
who
she
was
and
her
heart
beat
fast
if
this
lady
were
in
town
then
so
was
he
he
would
not
have
stayed
behind
at
westover
she
would
have
left
the
room
but
there
was
not
time
the
mistress
of
the
house
smiling
and
obsequious
fluttered
in
and
evelyn
byrd
followed
there
had
been
ordered
for
her
a
hood
of
golden
tissue
with
wide
and
long
streamers
to
be
tied
beneath
the
chin
and
she
was
come
to
try
it
on
mistress
stagg
had
it
all
but
ready
there
was
only
the
least
bit
of
stitchery
would
mistress
evelyn
condescend
to
wait
a
very
few
minutes
she
placed
a
chair
and
the
lady
sank
into
it
finding
the
quiet
of
the
shadowed
room
pleasant
enough
after
the
sunlight
and
talkativeness
of
the
world
without
mistress
stagg
in
her
role
of
milliner
took
the
gauzy
trifle
called
by
courtesy
a
hood
to
the
farthest
window
and
fell
busily
to
work
it
seemed
to
grow
more
and
more
quiet
in
the
room
the
shadow
of
the
leaves
lay
still
upon
the
floor
the
drowsy
humming
of
the
bees
outside
the
windows
the
sound
of
locusts
in
the
trees
the
distant
noises
of
the
town
all
grew
more
remote
then
suddenly
appeared
to
cease
audrey
raised
her
eyes
and
met
the
eyes
of
evelyn
she
knew
that
they
had
been
upon
her
for
a
long
time
in
the
quiet
of
the
room
she
had
sat
breathless
her
head
bowed
over
her
work
that
lay
idly
in
her
lap
but
at
last
she
must
look
the
two
gazed
at
each
other
with
a
sorrowful
steadfastness
in
the
largeness
of
their
several
natures
there
was
no
room
for
it
was
the
soul
of
each
that
gazed
but
in
the
mists
of
earthly
ignorance
they
could
not
read
what
was
written
and
they
erred
in
their
guessing
audrey
went
not
far
wide
this
was
the
princess
and
out
of
the
fullness
of
a
heart
that
ached
with
loss
she
could
have
knelt
and
kissed
the
hem
of
her
robe
and
wished
her
long
and
happy
life
there
was
no
bitterness
in
her
heart
she
never
dreamed
that
she
had
wronged
the
princess
but
evelyn
thought
this
is
the
girl
they
talk
about
god
knows
if
he
had
loved
worthily
i
might
not
so
much
have
minded
from
the
garden
came
a
burst
of
laughter
and
high
voices
mistress
stagg
started
up
is
our
people
mistress
evelyn
coming
from
the
playhouse
we
lodge
them
in
the
house
by
the
bowling
green
but
after
rehearsals
they
apt
to
stop
here
i
send
them
packing
the
hood
is
finished
audrey
will
set
it
upon
your
head
while
i
am
gone
here
child
mind
you
do
crush
it
she
gave
the
hood
into
audrey
hands
and
hurried
from
the
room
evelyn
sat
motionless
her
silken
draperies
flowing
around
her
one
white
arm
bent
the
soft
curve
of
her
cheek
resting
upon
ringed
fingers
her
eyes
yet
dwelt
upon
audrey
standing
as
motionless
the
mist
of
gauze
and
lace
in
her
hands
do
not
trouble
yourself
she
said
in
her
low
clear
voice
i
will
wait
until
mistress
stagg
returns
the
tone
was
very
cold
but
audrey
scarce
noticed
that
it
was
so
if
i
may
i
should
like
to
serve
you
she
said
pleadingly
i
will
be
very
careful
leaving
the
window
she
came
and
knelt
beside
evelyn
but
when
she
would
have
put
the
golden
hood
upon
her
head
the
other
drew
back
with
a
gesture
of
aversion
a
quick
recoil
of
her
entire
frame
the
hood
slipped
to
the
floor
after
a
moment
audrey
rose
and
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
neither
spoke
but
it
was
the
one
who
thought
no
evil
whose
eyes
first
sought
the
floor
her
dark
cheek
paled
and
her
lips
trembled
she
turned
and
going
back
to
her
seat
by
the
window
took
up
her
fallen
work
evelyn
with
a
sharp
catch
of
her
breath
withdrew
her
attention
from
the
other
occupant
of
the
room
and
fixed
it
upon
a
moted
sunbeam
lying
like
a
bar
between
the
two
mistress
stagg
returned
the
hood
was
fitted
and
its
purchaser
prepared
to
leave
audrey
rose
and
made
her
curtsy
timidly
but
with
a
quick
appealing
motion
of
her
hand
was
not
this
the
lady
whom
he
loved
that
people
said
he
was
to
wed
and
had
he
not
told
her
long
ago
that
he
would
speak
of
her
to
mistress
evelyn
byrd
and
that
she
too
would
be
her
friend
last
may
day
when
the
guinea
was
put
into
her
hand
the
smile
was
bright
her
voice
sweet
and
friendly
now
how
changed
in
her
craving
for
a
word
a
look
from
one
so
near
him
one
that
perhaps
had
seen
him
not
an
hour
before
in
her
sad
homage
for
the
object
of
his
love
she
forgot
her
late
repulse
and
grew
bold
when
evelyn
would
have
passed
her
she
put
forth
a
trembling
hand
and
began
to
speak
to
say
she
scarce
knew
what
but
the
words
died
in
her
throat
for
a
moment
evelyn
stood
her
head
averted
an
angry
red
staining
neck
and
bosom
and
beautiful
face
her
eyes
half
closed
the
long
lashes
quivering
against
her
cheek
and
she
smiled
faintly
in
scorn
of
the
girl
and
scorn
of
herself
then
freeing
her
skirt
from
audrey
clasp
she
passed
in
silence
from
the
room
audrey
stood
at
the
window
and
with
wide
pained
eyes
watched
her
go
down
the
path
mistress
stagg
was
with
her
talking
volubly
and
evelyn
seemed
to
listen
with
smiling
patience
one
of
the
bedizened
negroes
opened
the
chair
door
the
lady
entered
and
was
borne
away
before
mistress
stagg
could
reenter
her
house
audrey
had
gone
quietly
up
the
winding
stair
to
the
little
whitewashed
room
where
she
found
the
minister
wife
astir
and
restored
to
good
humor
her
sleep
had
helped
her
she
would
go
down
at
once
and
see
what
mary
was
at
darden
too
was
coming
as
soon
as
the
meeting
at
the
church
had
adjourned
after
dinner
they
would
walk
out
and
see
the
town
until
which
time
audrey
might
do
as
she
pleased
when
she
was
gone
audrey
softly
shut
herself
in
the
little
room
and
lay
down
upon
the
bed
very
still
with
her
face
hidden
in
her
arm
with
twelve
of
the
clock
came
darden
quite
sober
distrait
in
manner
and
uneasy
of
eye
and
presently
interrupted
mistress
stagg
flow
of
conversation
by
a
demand
to
speak
with
his
wife
alone
at
that
time
of
day
the
garden
was
a
solitude
and
thither
the
two
repaired
taking
their
seats
upon
a
bench
built
round
a
well
queried
mistress
deborah
bitterly
i
suppose
commissary
showed
himself
vastly
civil
i
dare
say
you
to
preach
before
the
governor
next
sunday
or
maybe
they
chosen
bailey
he
boasts
that
he
can
drink
you
under
the
table
one
of
these
fine
days
you
drink
and
curse
and
game
yourself
out
of
a
parish
darden
drew
figures
on
the
ground
with
his
heavy
stick
on
such
a
fine
day
as
this
he
said
in
a
suppressed
voice
and
looked
askance
at
the
wife
whom
he
beat
upon
occasion
but
whose
counsel
he
held
in
respect
she
turned
upon
him
what
do
you
mean
they
talk
and
talk
and
cry
shame
and
a
shame
it
is
the
lord
knows
but
it
never
comes
to
anything
it
has
come
to
this
interrupted
darden
with
an
oath
that
this
governor
means
to
sweep
in
the
corners
that
the
commissary
damned
scot
appointed
a
committee
to
inquire
into
the
charges
made
against
me
and
bailey
and
john
worden
that
seven
of
my
vestrymen
are
dead
against
me
and
that
has
suddenly
become
a
very
common
word
seven
of
the
vestry
said
his
wife
after
a
pause
who
are
they
darden
told
her
if
haward
she
began
slowly
her
green
eyes
steady
upon
the
situation
there
not
one
of
that
seven
would
care
to
disoblige
him
i
warrant
you
he
could
make
them
face
about
they
say
he
knew
the
governor
in
england
too
and
there
his
late
gift
to
the
college
the
commissary
would
forget
that
if
haward
would
she
broke
off
and
with
knit
brows
studied
the
problem
more
intently
if
he
would
he
could
darden
finished
for
her
with
his
interest
this
cloud
would
go
by
as
others
have
done
before
i
know
that
deborah
and
that
the
card
i
going
to
play
if
you
had
gone
to
him
hat
in
hand
a
month
ago
he
have
done
you
any
favor
said
his
helpmate
sourly
but
it
is
different
now
he
over
his
fancy
and
besides
he
at
westover
he
in
williamsburgh
at
marot
ordinary
said
the
other
as
for
his
being
over
his
fancy
i
try
that
fancy
or
no
fancy
if
a
woman
asked
him
for
a
fairing
he
would
give
it
her
or
i
do
know
my
gentleman
we
call
his
interest
a
ribbon
or
some
such
toy
and
audrey
shall
ask
him
for
it
audrey
is
a
fool
cried
mistress
deborah
and
you
had
best
be
careful
or
you
prove
yourself
another
there
been
talk
enough
already
audrey
village
innocent
that
she
is
is
the
only
one
that
does
know
it
the
town
not
the
country
if
he
sets
tongues
here
he
wo
said
darden
roughly
he

and
audrey
a
good
girl
go
send
her
here
deborah
bid
her
fetch
me
inkhorn
and
a
pen
and
a
sheet
of
paper
if
he

anything
for
me
it
will
have
to
be
done
quickly
they
in
haste
to
pull
me
out
of
saddle
the
damned
canting
pack
but
i
try
conclusions
with
them
his
wife
departed
muttering
to
herself
and
the
reverend
gideon
pulled
out
of
his
capacious
pocket
a
flask
of
usquebaugh
in
five
minutes
from
the
time
of
his
setting
it
to
his
lips
the
light
in
which
he
viewed
the
situation
turned
from
gray
to
rose
color
by
the
time
he
espied
audrey
coming
toward
him
through
the
garden
he
felt
a
moral
certainty
that
when
he
came
to
die
if
ever
he
died
it
would
be
in
his
bed
in
the
fair
view
glebe
house
chapter
xvii
within
the
playhouse
haward
sitting
at
the
table
in
marot
best
room
wrote
an
answer
to
audrey
letter
and
tore
it
up
wrote
another
and
gave
it
to
juba
to
be
given
to
the
messenger
waiting
below
recalled
the
negro
before
he
could
reach
the
door
destroyed
the
second
note
and
wrote
a
third
the
first
had
been
wise
and
kind
telling
her
that
he
was
much
engaged
lightly
and
skillfully
waving
aside
her
request
the
only
one
she
made
that
she
might
see
him
that
day
the
second
had
been
less
wise
the
last
told
her
that
he
would
come
at
five
to
the
in
mistress
stagg
garden
when
he
was
alone
in
the
room
he
sat
for
some
time
very
still
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
head
thrown
back
against
the
tall
woodwork
of
his
chair
his
face
was
stern
in
repose
a
handsome
even
a
fine
face
with
a
look
of
power
and
reflection
but
somewhat
worn
and
haggard
of
aspect
when
presently
he
roused
himself
and
took
up
the
letter
that
lay
before
him
the
paper
shook
in
his
hand
wine
juba
he
said
to
the
slave
who
now
reëntered
the
room
and
close
the
window
it
is
growing
cold
there
were
but
three
lines
between
the
haward
and
audrey
the
writing
was
stiff
and
clerkly
the
words
very
simple
a
child
asking
of
a
favor
he
guessed
rightly
that
it
was
the
first
letter
of
her
own
that
she
had
ever
written
suddenly
a
wave
of
passionate
tenderness
took
him
he
bowed
his
head
and
kissed
the
paper
for
the
moment
life
and
his
own
complex
nature
alike
straightened
to
a
beautiful
simplicity
he
was
the
lover
merely
life
was
but
the
light
and
shadow
through
which
moved
the
woman
whom
he
loved
he
came
back
to
himself
and
tried
to
think
it
out
but
could
not
finally
with
a
weary
impatience
he
declined
to
think
at
all
he
was
to
dine
at
the
governor
evelyn
would
be
there
only
momentarily
in
those
days
of
early
summer
had
he
wavered
in
his
determination
to
make
this
lady
his
wife
pride
was
at
the
root
of
his
being
pride
and
a
deep
though
because
they
were
so
sunken
and
because
poisonous
roots
can
flower
most
deceivingly
he
neither
called
himself
nor
was
called
of
others
a
proud
and
willful
man
he
wished
evelyn
for
his
wife
nay
more
though
on
may
day
he
had
shown
her
that
he
loved
her
not
though
in
june
he
had
offered
her
a
love
that
was
only
admiring
affection
yet
in
the
past
month
at
westover
he
had
come
almost
to
believe
that
he
loved
her
truly
that
she
was
worthy
of
true
love
he
knew
very
well
with
all
his
strength
of
will
he
had
elected
to
forget
the
summer
that
lay
behind
him
at
fair
view
and
to
live
in
the
summer
that
was
with
him
at
westover
his
success
had
been
gratifying
in
the
flush
of
it
he
persuaded
himself
that
a
chamber
of
the
heart
had
been
locked
forever
and
the
key
thrown
away
and
lo
now
a
touch
the
sudden
sight
of
a
name
and
the
door
had
flown
wide
nay
the
very
walls
were
rived
away
it
was
not
a
glance
over
the
shoulder
it
was
full
presence
in
the
room
so
lately
sealed
he
knew
that
evelyn
loved
him
it
was
understood
of
all
their
acquaintance
that
he
was
her
suitor
months
ago
he
had
formally
craved
her
permission
to
pay
his
addresses
there
were
times
in
those
weeks
at
westover
when
she
had
come
nigh
to
yielding
to
believing
that
he
loved
her
he
was
certain
that
with
time
he
would
have
his
way
but
the
room
the
closed
room
in
which
now
he
sat
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
was
suddenly
back
in
spirit
in
his
garden
at
fair
view
the
cherries
were
ripe
the
birds
were
singing
great
butterflies
went
by
the
sunshine
beat
on
the
dial
on
the
walks
and
the
smell
of
the
roses
was
strong
as
wine
his
senses
swam
with
the
warmth
and
fragrance
the
garden
enlarged
itself
and
blazed
in
beauty
never
was
sunshine
so
golden
as
that
never
were
roses
so
large
never
odors
so
a
spirit
walked
in
the
garden
paths
its
name
was
audrey
no
it
was
speaking
speaking
words
of
passion
and
of
woe
its
name
was
eloïsa
when
he
rose
from
his
chair
he
staggered
slightly
and
put
his
hand
to
his
head
recovering
himself
in
a
moment
he
called
for
his
hat
and
cane
and
leaving
the
ordinary
turned
his
face
toward
the
palace
a
garrulous
fellow
councilor
also
bidden
to
his
excellency
dinner
party
overtook
him
and
falling
into
step
began
to
speak
first
of
the
pirates
trial
and
then
of
the
weather
a
hot
and
feverish
summer
was
said
that
a
good
third
of
the
servants
arriving
in
the
country
since
spring
had
died
of
their
seasoning
the
slaver
lying
in
the
york
had
thrown
thirty
blacks
overboard
in
the
ran
from
barbadoes
some
strange
sickness
or
other
adsbud
he
would
not
buy
from
the
lot
the
master
landed
had
they
been
white
they
had
showed
like
spectres
september
was
the
worst
month
of
the
year
he
did
not
find
haward
in
looks
now
best
consult
contesse
though
indeed
he
himself
had
a
preventive
of
fever
which
never
failed
first
he
bled
then
to
so
much
of
peruvian
bark
haward
declared
that
he
was
very
well
and
turned
the
conversation
piratewards
again
the
dinner
at
the
palace
was
somewhat
hurried
the
gentlemen
rising
with
the
ladies
despite
the
enticements
of
burgundy
and
champagne
it
was
the
afternoon
set
apart
for
the
indian
dance
the
bonfire
in
the
field
behind
the
magazine
had
been
kindled
the
nottoways
and
meherrins
were
waiting
still
as
statues
for
the
gathering
of
their
audience
before
the
dance
the
great
white
father
was
to
speak
to
them
the
peace
pipe
also
was
to
be
smoked
the
town
gay
of
mood
and
snatching
at
enjoyment
emptied
its
people
into
the
sunny
field
only
they
who
could
not
go
stayed
at
home
those
folk
ministers
to
a
age
who
dwelt
in
the
house
by
the
bowling
green
or
in
the
shadow
of
the
theatre
itself
must
go
at
all
rates
marcia
and
lucia
syphax
sempronius
and
the
african
prince
made
off
together
while
the
sons
of
cato
who
chanced
to
be
twin
brothers
followed
with
a
slower
step
their
indentures
would
expire
next
month
and
they
had
thoughts
the
one
of
becoming
an
overseer
the
other
of
moving
up
country
and
joining
a
company
of
rangers
hence
their
somewhat
haughty
bearing
toward
their
fellow
players
who
except
old
syphax
who
acted
for
the
love
of
it
had
not
even
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
freedom
and
stagg
saw
their
minions
depart
and
then
themselves
left
the
little
white
house
in
palace
street
mistress
deborah
was
with
them
but
not
audrey
she
ca
abide
the
sight
of
an
indian
said
the
wife
indifferently
besides
darden
will
be
here
from
the
church
presently
and
he
may
want
her
to
write
for
him
she
and
peggy
can
mind
the
house
the
capitol
clock
was
telling
five
when
haward
entered
the
garden
by
the
nicholson
street
gate
there
had
arisen
a
zephyr
of
the
evening
to
loosen
the
yellow
locust
leaves
and
send
them
down
upon
the
path
to
lay
cool
fingers
upon
his
forehead
that
burned
and
to
whisper
low
at
his
ear
house
and
garden
and
silent
street
seemed
asleep
in
the
late
sunshine
safe
folded
from
the
storm
of
sound
that
raged
in
the
field
on
the
border
of
the
town
distance
muffled
the
indian
drums
and
changed
the
scream
of
the
pipes
into
a
wailing
savage
cries
bursts
of
applause
and
laughter
all
came
softly
blent
like
the
hum
of
the
bees
mellow
like
the
sunlight
there
was
no
one
in
the
haward
walked
on
to
the
grape
arbor
and
found
there
a
black
girl
who
pointed
to
an
open
door
pertaining
not
to
the
small
white
house
but
to
that
portion
of
the
theatre
which
abutted
upon
the
garden
haward
passing
a
window
of
stagg
domicile
was
aware
of
darden
sitting
within
much
engaged
with
a
great
book
and
a
tankard
of
sack
he
made
no
pause
for
the
vision
and
another
moment
found
him
within
the
playhouse
the
sunlight
entered
in
at
the
door
and
at
one
high
window
but
yet
the
place
was
dim
the
gallery
and
the
rude
boxes
were
all
in
shadow
the
sunbeams
from
the
door
struck
into
the
pit
while
those
from
the
high
window
let
fall
a
shaft
of
misty
light
upon
the
stage
itself
set
for
a
hall
in
utica
with
five
cane
chairs
an
ancient
settle
and
a
spanish
table
on
the
settle
in
the
pale
gold
of
the
falling
light
sat
audrey
her
hands
clasped
over
her
knees
her
head
thrown
back
and
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
shadowy
chill
and
soundless
space
before
her
upon
speaking
her
name
she
sighed
and
loosing
her
hands
turned
toward
him
he
came
and
leaned
upon
the
back
of
the
settle
you
sent
for
me
audrey
he
said
and
laid
his
hand
lightly
upon
her
hair
she
shrank
from
his
touch
the
minister
made
me
write
the
letter
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
did
not
wish
to
trouble
you
sir
upon
her
wrist
were
dark
marks
did
darden
do
that
demanded
haward
as
he
took
his
seat
beside
her
audrey
looked
at
the
bruise
indifferently
then
with
her
other
hand
covered
it
from
sight
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
haward
she
said
i
hope
that
after
his
many
kindnesses
he
will
not
refuse
to
do
me
this
greatest
one
if
he
should
grant
my
request
the
gratitude
which
i
must
needs
already
feel
toward
him
will
be
increased
tenfold
the
words
came
precisely
in
an
even
voice
haward
smiled
child
you
have
conned
your
lesson
well
leave
the
words
of
the
book
and
tell
me
in
your
own
language
what
his
reverence
wants
audrey
told
him
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
not
listening
when
she
had
come
to
an
end
of
the
minister
grievances
she
sat
with
downcast
eyes
waiting
for
him
to
speak
wishing
that
he
would
not
look
at
her
so
steadily
she
meant
never
to
show
him
her
heart
never
never
but
beneath
his
gaze
it
was
hard
to
keep
her
cheek
from
burning
her
lip
from
quivering
at
last
he
spoke
would
it
please
you
audrey
if
i
should
save
this
man
from
his
just
deserts
audrey
raised
her
eyes
he
and
mistress
deborah
are
all
my
friends
she
said
the
glebe
house
is
my
home
deep
sadness
spoke
in
voice
and
eye
the
shaft
of
light
moving
had
left
her
in
the
outer
shadow
she
sat
there
with
a
listless
grace
with
a
dignity
too
that
was
not
without
pathos
there
had
been
a
forlorn
child
there
had
been
an
unfriended
girl
there
was
now
a
woman
for
life
to
fondle
or
to
wreak
its
rage
upon
the
change
was
subtle
one
more
a
lover
or
less
a
lover
than
haward
might
not
have
noted
it
i
will
petition
the
commissary
he
said
the
governor
is
your
having
in
friends
so
slight
as
you
say
little
maid
oh
he
could
reach
to
the
quick
she
was
sure
that
he
had
not
meant
to
accuse
her
of
ingratitude
and
pitifully
sure
that
she
must
have
seemed
guilty
of
it
no
no
she
cried
i
have
had
a
friend
her
voice
broke
and
she
started
to
her
feet
her
face
to
the
door
all
her
being
quiveringly
eager
to
be
gone
she
had
asked
that
which
she
was
bidden
to
ask
had
gained
that
which
she
was
bidden
to
gain
for
the
rest
it
was
far
better
that
she
should
go
better
far
for
him
to
think
her
dull
and
thankless
as
a
stone
than
see
than
see
when
haward
caught
her
by
the
hand
she
trembled
and
drew
a
sobbing
breath
have
had
a
friend
audrey
he
asked
why
not
have
a
friend
why
not
thought
audrey
of
course
he
would
think
why
not
well
then
i
have
a
friend
she
said
aloud
have
you
not
been
to
me
the
kindest
friend
the
most
generous
she
faltered
but
presently
went
on
a
strange
courage
coming
to
her
she
had
turned
slightly
toward
him
though
she
looked
not
at
him
but
upward
to
where
the
light
streamed
through
the
high
window
it
fell
now
upon
her
face
it
is
a
great
thing
to
save
life
she
said
to
save
a
soul
alive
how
much
greater
to
have
kept
one
soul
in
the
knowledge
that
there
is
goodness
mercy
tenderness
god
to
have
given
it
bread
to
eat
where
it
sat
among
the
stones
water
to
drink
where
all
the
streams
were
dry
oh
a
king
might
be
proud
of
that
and
that
is
what
you
have
done
for
me
when
you
sailed
away
so
many
years
ago
and
left
me
with
the
minister
and
his
wife
they
were
not
always
kind
but
i
knew
that
you
thought
them
so
and
i
always
said
to
myself
he
knew
he
would
be
sorry
for
me
at
last
i
said
is
sorry
for
me
there
is
the
sea
and
he
can
not
come
but
he
knows
and
is
sorry
it
was
for
you
thought
that
i
was
happy
did
you
not
but
it
helped
me
very
much
i
was
only
a
child
you
know
and
i
was
so
very
lonely
i
could
not
think
of
mother
and
molly
for
when
i
did
i
saw
them
as
as
i
had
seen
them
last
the
dark
scared
me
until
i
found
that
i
could
pretend
that
you
were
holding
my
hand
as
you
used
to
do
when
night
came
in
the
valley
after
a
while
i
had
only
to
put
out
my
hand
and
yours
was
there
waiting
for
it
i
hope
that
you
can
understand
i
want
you
to
know
how
large
is
my
debt
as
i
grew
so
did
the
debt
when
i
was
a
girl
it
was
larger
than
when
i
was
a
child
do
you
know
with
whom
i
have
lived
all
these
years
there
is
the
minister
who
comes
reeling
home
from
the
crossroads
ordinary
who
swears
over
the
dice
who
teaches
cunning
that
he
calls
wisdom
laughs
at
man
and
scarce
believes
in
god
his
hand
is
heavy
this
is
his
mark
she
held
up
her
bruised
wrist
to
the
light
then
let
the
hand
drop
when
she
spoke
of
the
minister
she
made
a
gesture
toward
the
shadows
growing
ever
thicker
and
darker
in
the
body
of
the
house
it
was
as
though
she
saw
him
there
and
was
pointing
him
out
there
is
the
minister
wife
she
said
and
the
motion
of
her
hand
again
accused
the
shadows
oh
their
roof
has
sheltered
me
i
have
eaten
of
their
bread
but
truth
is
truth
there
is
the
schoolmaster
with
the
branded
hands
he
taught
me
you
know
there
is
she
was
looking
with
wide
eyes
into
the
deepest
of
the
shadows
there
is
hugon
her
voice
died
away
haward
did
not
move
or
speak
and
for
a
minute
there
was
silence
in
the
dusky
playhouse
audrey
broke
it
with
a
laugh
soft
light
and
clear
that
came
oddly
upon
the
mood
of
the
hour
presently
she
was
speaking
again
do
you
think
it
strange
that
i
should
laugh
i
laughed
to
think
i
have
escaped
them
all
do
you
know
that
they
call
me
a
dreamer
once
deep
in
the
woods
i
met
the
witch
who
lives
at
the
head
of
the
creek
she
told
me
that
i
was
a
dream
child
and
that
all
my
life
was
a
dream
and
i
must
pray
never
to
awake
but
i
do
not
think
she
knew
for
all
that
she
is
a
witch
they
none
of
them
know
none
none
if
i
had
not
dreamed
as
they
call
it
if
i
had
watched
and
listened
and
laid
to
heart
and
become
like
them
oh
then
i
should
have
died
of
your
look
when
at
last
you
came
but
i
and
in
that
long
dream
you
though
you
were
overseas
you
showed
me
little
by
little
that
the
spirit
is
not
bond
but
free
that
it
can
walk
the
waves
and
climb
to
the
sunset
and
the
stars
and
i
found
that
the
woods
were
fair
that
the
earth
was
fair
and
kind
as
when
i
was
a
little
child
and
i
grew
to
love
and
long
for
goodness
and
day
by
day
i
have
had
a
life
and
a
world
where
flowers
bloomed
and
the
streams
ran
fresh
and
there
was
bread
indeed
to
eat
and
it
was
you
that
showed
me
the
road
that
opened
for
me
the
gates
she
ceased
to
speak
and
turning
fully
toward
him
took
his
hand
and
put
it
to
her
lips
may
you
be
very
happy
she
said
i
thank
you
sir
that
when
you
came
at
last
you
did
not
break
my
dream
the
dream
fell
short
the
smile
upon
her
face
was
very
sweet
very
pure
and
noble
she
would
have
gone
without
another
word
but
haward
caught
her
by
the
sleeve
stay
awhile
he
cried
i
too
am
a
dreamer
though
not
like
you
you
maid
of
dian
dark
saint
cold
vestal
with
your
eyes
forever
on
the
still
white
flame
audrey
audrey
audrey
do
you
know
what
a
pretty
name
you
have
child
or
how
dark
are
your
eyes
or
how
fine
this
hair
that
a
queen
might
envy
westover
has
been
dull
child
audrey
shook
her
head
and
smiled
and
thought
that
he
was
laughing
at
her
a
vision
of
evelyn
as
evelyn
had
looked
that
morning
passed
before
her
she
did
not
believe
that
he
had
found
westover
dull
i
am
coming
to
fair
view
dark
audrey
he
went
on
in
its
garden
there
are
roses
yet
blooming
for
thy
hair
there
are
sweet
verses
calling
to
be
read
there
are
cool
sequestered
walks
to
be
trodden
with
thy
hand
in
mine
thy
hand
in
mine
little
maid
life
is
but
once
we
shall
never
pass
this
way
again
drink
the
cup
wear
the
roses
live
the
verses
of
what
sing
all
the
sweetest
verses
witch
forest
audrey
of
love
said
audrey
simply
she
had
freed
her
hand
from
his
clasp
and
her
face
was
troubled
she
did
not
understand
never
had
she
seen
him
like
this
with
shining
eyes
and
hot
unsteady
touch
there
is
the
ball
at
the
palace
night
he
went
on
i
must
be
there
for
a
fair
lady
and
i
are
to
dance
together
he
smiled
poor
audrey
who
hath
never
been
to
a
ball
who
only
dances
with
the
elves
beneath
the
moon
around
a
beechen
tree
the
next
day
i
will
go
to
fair
view
and
you
will
be
at
the
glebe
house
and
we
will
take
up
the
summer
where
we
left
it
that
weary
month
ago
no
no
said
audrey
hurriedly
and
shook
her
head
a
vague
and
formless
trouble
had
laid
its
cold
touch
upon
her
heart
it
was
as
though
she
saw
a
cloud
coming
up
but
it
was
no
larger
than
a
man
hand
and
she
knew
not
what
it
should
portend
nor
that
it
would
grow
into
a
storm
he
was
strange
that
she
felt
but
then
all
her
day
since
the
coming
of
evelyn
had
been
sad
and
strange
the
shaft
of
sunshine
was
gone
from
the
stage
and
all
the
house
was
in
shadow
audrey
descended
the
two
or
three
steps
leading
into
the
pit
and
haward
followed
her
side
by
side
they
left
the
playhouse
and
found
themselves
in
the
garden
and
also
in
the
presence
of
five
or
six
ladies
and
gentlemen
seated
upon
the
grass
beneath
a
or
engaged
in
rifling
the
grape
arbor
of
its
purple
fruit
the
garden
was
a
public
one
and
this
gay
little
party
having
tired
of
the
indian
spectacle
had
repaired
hither
to
treat
of
its
own
affairs
moreover
it
had
been
there
scattered
upon
the
grass
in
view
of
the
playhouse
door
for
the
better
part
of
an
hour
concerned
with
its
own
wit
and
laughter
it
had
caught
no
sound
of
low
voices
issuing
from
the
theatre
and
for
the
two
who
talked
within
all
outward
noise
had
ranked
as
coming
from
the
distant
crowded
fields
a
young
girl
her
silken
apron
raised
to
catch
the
clusters
which
a
gentleman
mounted
upon
a
chair
threw
down
gave
a
little
scream
and
let
fall
her
purple
hoard
cried
the
gentleman
one
and
another
exclaimed
and
a
withered
beauty
seated
beneath
the
laughed
shrilly
a
moment
an
effort
a
sharp
recall
of
wandering
thoughts
and
haward
had
the
situation
in
hand
an
easy
greeting
to
the
gentlemen
debonair
compliments
for
the
ladies
a
question
or
two
as
to
the
entertainment
they
had
left
then
a
negligent
bringing
forward
of
audrey
a
little
brown
ward
and
ancient
playmate
of
mine
shot
up
in
the
night
to
be
as
tall
as
a
woman
make
thy
curtsy
child
and
go
tell
the
minister
what
i
have
said
on
the
subject
he
wots
of
audrey
curtsied
and
went
away
having
never
raised
her
eyes
to
note
the
stare
of
curiosity
the
suppressed
smile
the
glance
from
eye
to
eye
which
had
trod
upon
her
introduction
to
the
company
haward
remaining
with
his
friends
and
acquaintances
gathered
grapes
for
the
blooming
girl
and
the
withered
beauty
and
for
a
little
smiling
woman
who
was
known
for
as
arrant
a
scandalmonger
as
could
be
found
in
virginia
chapter
xviii
a
question
of
colors
evelyn
seated
at
her
toilette
table
and
in
the
hands
of
timothy
green
hairdresser
in
ordinary
to
williamsburgh
looked
with
unseeing
eyes
at
her
own
fair
reflection
in
the
glass
before
her
chloe
the
black
handmaiden
who
stood
at
the
door
latch
in
hand
had
time
to
grow
tired
of
waiting
before
her
mistress
spoke
you
may
tell
haward
that
i
am
at
home
chloe
bring
him
here
the
hairdresser
drew
a
comb
through
the
rippling
brown
tresses
and
commenced
his
most
elaborate
arrangement
working
with
pursed
lips
and
head
bent
now
to
this
side
now
to
that
he
had
been
a
man
since
sunrise
and
the
lighting
of
the
palace
candles
that
night
might
find
him
yet
employed
by
some
belated
dame
evelyn
was
very
pale
and
shadows
were
beneath
her
eyes
moved
by
a
sudden
impulse
she
took
from
the
table
a
rouge
pot
and
hastily
and
with
trembling
fingers
rubbed
bloom
into
her
cheeks
then
the
patch
box
one
two
three
tory
partisans
now
i
am
less
like
a
ghost
she
said
green
do
i
not
look
well
and
merry
and
as
though
my
sleep
had
been
sound
and
dreamless
in
his
high
cracked
voice
the
hairdresser
was
sure
that
pale
or
glowing
grave
or
gay
mistress
evelyn
byrd
would
be
the
toast
at
the
ball
that
night
the
lady
laughed
for
she
heard
haward
step
upon
the
landing
he
entered
to
the
gay
tinkling
sound
tent
over
the
hand
she
extended
then
laying
aside
hat
and
cane
took
his
seat
beside
the
table
tresses
man
imperial
race
insnare
and
beauty
draws
us
with
a
single

he
quoted
with
a
smile
then
will
you
take
our
hearts
in
blue
evelyn
you
know
that
i
love
you
best
in
blue
she
lifted
her
fan
from
the
table
and
waved
it
lightly
to
and
fro
i
go
in
rose
color
she
said
is
the
gown
i
wore
at
lady
rich
rout
i
dare
say
you
do
not
remember
it
but
my
lord
of
peterborough
said
she
broke
off
and
smiled
to
her
fan
her
voice
was
sweet
and
slightly
drawling
the
languid
turn
of
the
wrist
the
easy
grace
of
attitude
the
beauty
of
bared
neck
and
tinted
face
of
lowered
lids
and
slow
faint
smile
oh
she
was
genuine
fine
lady
if
she
was
not
quite
evelyn
a
breeze
blowing
through
the
open
windows
stirred
their
gay
hangings
of
flowered
cotton
the
black
girl
sat
in
a
corner
and
sewed
the
supple
fingers
of
the
hairdresser
went
in
and
out
of
the
heavy
hair
roses
in
a
deep
blue
bowl
made
the
room
smell
like
a
garden
haward
sighed
so
pleasant
was
it
to
sit
quietly
in
this
cool
chamber
after
the
glare
and
wavering
of
the
world
without
my
lord
of
peterborough
is
magnificent
at
compliments
he
said
kindly
but
be
a
jeweled
speech
indeed
that
outdid
your
deserving
evelyn
come
now
wear
the
blue
i
will
find
you
white
roses
you
shall
wear
them
for
a
breast
knot
and
in
the
minuet
return
me
one
again
evelyn
waved
her
fan
i
dance
the
minuet
with
mr
lee
her
tone
was
still
sweetly
languid
her
manner
most
indifferent
the
thick
and
glossy
tress
that
drawn
forward
was
to
ripple
over
white
neck
and
bosom
was
too
loosely
curled
she
regarded
it
in
the
mirror
with
an
anxious
frown
then
spoke
of
it
to
the
hairdresser
haward
smiling
watched
her
with
eyes
lee
is
a
fortunate
gentleman
he
said
i
may
gain
the
rose
perhaps
in
the
country
dance
that
is
better
remarked
the
lady
surveying
with
satisfaction
the
lock
the
country
dance
for
that
lightfoot
hath
my
promise
it
seems
that
i
am
a
laggard
said
haward
the
knocker
sounded
below
i
am
at
home
chloe
announced
the
mistress
and
the
slave
laying
aside
her
work
slipped
from
the
room
haward
played
with
the
trifles
upon
the
dressing
table
wherein
have
i
offended
evelyn
he
asked
at
last
the
lady
arched
her
brows
and
the
action
made
her
for
the
moment
very
like
her
handsome
father
why
there
is
no
offense
she
cried
an
old
acquaintance
a
family
friend
i
step
a
minuet
with
lee
i
stand
up
for
a
country
dance
with
lightfoot
i
wear
pink
instead
of
blue
and
have
lost
my
liking
for
white
roses
what
is
there
in
all
this
that
needs
such
a
question
ah
you
have
broken
my
silver
chain
i
am
clumsy
he
exclaimed
a
thousand
pardons
he
let
the
broken
toy
slip
from
his
fingers
to
the
polished
surface
of
the
table
and
forgot
that
it
was
there
since
colonel
byrd
i
am
sorry
to
learn
keeps
his
room
with
a
fit
of
the
gout
may
i
an
old
acquaintance
a
family
friend
conduct
you
to
the
palace
the
fan
waved
on
thank
you
but
i
go
in
our
coach
and
need
no
escort
the
lady
yawned
very
delicately
behind
her
slender
fingers
then
dropped
the
fan
and
spoke
with
animation
ah
here
is
lee
in
a
good
hour
sir
i
saw
the
bracelet
that
you
mended
for
mistress
winston
canst
do
as
much
for
my
poor
chain
here
see
it
and
this
silver
heart
have
parted
company
lee
kissed
her
hand
and
took
snuff
with
haward
then
after
an
ardent
speech
crammed
with
references
to
vulcan
and
venus
chains
that
were
not
slight
hearts
that
were
of
softer
substance
sat
down
beside
this
kind
and
dazzling
vision
and
applied
his
clever
fingers
to
the
problem
in
hand
he
was
a
personable
young
gentleman
who
had
studied
at
oxford
and
who
proudly
conscious
that
his
tragedy
of
artaxerxes
then
reposing
in
the
escritoire
at
home
much
outmerited
haward
comedy
felt
no
diffidence
in
the
company
of
the
elder
fine
gentleman
he
rattled
on
of
this
and
that
and
evelyn
listened
kindly
with
only
the
curve
of
her
cheek
visible
to
the
family
friend
the
silver
heart
was
restored
to
its
chain
the
lady
smiled
her
thanks
the
enamored
youth
hitched
his
chair
some
inches
nearer
the
fair
whom
he
had
obliged
and
with
his
hand
upon
his
heart
entered
the
realm
of
speech
the
gay
curtains
waved
the
roses
were
sweet
black
chloe
sewed
and
sewed
the
hairdresser
hands
wove
in
and
out
as
though
he
were
a
wizard
making
passes
haward
rose
to
take
his
leave
evelyn
yielded
him
her
hand
it
was
cold
against
his
lips
she
was
nonchalant
and
smiling
he
was
easy
unoffended
admirably
the
fine
gentleman
for
one
moment
their
eyes
met
i
had
been
wiser
thought
the
man
i
had
been
wiser
to
have
myself
told
her
of
that
brown
witch
that
innocent
sorceress
why
something
held
my
tongue
i
know
not
now
she
hath
read
my
idyl
but
all
darkened
all
awry
the
woman
thought
cruel
and
base
you
knew
that
my
heart
was
yours
to
break
cast
aside
and
forget
out
of
the
house
the
sunlight
beat
and
blinded
houses
of
red
brick
houses
of
white
wood
the
long
wide
dusty
duke
of
gloucester
street
gnarled
against
a
september
sky
deeply
passionately
blue
glimpses
of
wood
and
field
all
seemed
remote
without
distance
still
without
stillness
the
semblance
of
a
dream
and
yet
keen
and
near
to
oppression
it
was
a
town
of
stores
of
ordinaries
and
public
places
from
open
door
and
window
all
along
duke
of
gloucester
street
came
laughter
round
oaths
now
and
then
a
scrap
of
drinking
song
to
haward
giddy
ill
at
ease
sickening
of
a
fever
the
sounds
were
now
as
a
cry
in
his
ear
now
as
the
noise
of
a
distant
sea
the
minister
of
james
city
parish
and
the
minister
of
ware
creek
were
walking
before
him
arm
in
arm
set
full
sail
for
dinner
after
a
stormy
morning
for
lo
the
wicked
prospereth
said
one
and
fair
view
parish
bound
over
to
the
devil
again
plained
the
other
he
firm
in
the
saddle
he
ride
easy
to
the
day
he
drinks
himself
to
death
thanks
to
this
sudden
complaisance
of
governor
and
commissary
thanks
to
cried
the
other
sourly
and
gave
the
thanks
where
they
were
due
haward
heard
the
words
but
even
in
the
act
of
quickening
his
pace
to
lay
a
heavy
hand
upon
the
speaker
shoulder
a
listlessness
came
upon
him
and
he
forbore
the
memory
of
the
slurring
speech
went
from
him
his
thoughts
were
thistledown
blown
hither
and
yon
by
every
vagrant
air
coming
to
marot
ordinary
he
called
for
wine
then
went
up
the
stair
to
his
room
and
sitting
down
at
the
table
presently
fell
asleep
with
his
head
upon
his
arms
after
a
while
the
sounds
from
the
public
room
below
where
men
were
carousing
disturbed
his
slumber
he
stirred
and
awoke
refreshed
it
was
afternoon
but
he
felt
no
hunger
only
thirst
which
he
quenched
with
the
wine
at
hand
his
windows
gave
upon
the
capitol
and
a
green
wood
beyond
the
waving
trees
enticed
while
the
room
was
dull
and
the
noises
of
the
house
distasteful
he
said
to
himself
that
he
would
walk
abroad
would
go
out
under
the
beckoning
trees
and
be
rid
of
the
town
he
remembered
that
the
council
was
to
meet
that
afternoon
well
it
might
sit
without
him
he
was
for
the
woods
where
dwelt
the
cool
winds
and
the
shadows
deep
and
silent
a
few
yards
and
he
was
quit
of
duke
of
gloucester
street
behind
him
porticoed
capitol
gaol
and
tiny
vineclad
debtor
prison
in
the
gaol
yard
the
pirates
sat
upon
a
bench
in
the
sunshine
and
one
smoked
a
long
pipe
and
one
brooded
upon
his
irons
gold
rings
were
in
their
ears
and
their
black
hair
fell
from
beneath
colored
handkerchiefs
twisted
turbanwise
around
their
brows
the
gaoler
watched
them
standing
in
his
doorway
and
his
children
at
play
beneath
a
tree
built
with
sticks
a
mimic
scaffold
and
hanged
thereon
a
broken
puppet
there
was
a
shady
road
leading
through
a
wood
to
queen
creek
and
the
capitol
landing
and
down
this
road
went
haward
his
step
was
light
the
dullness
the
throbbing
pulses
the
oppression
of
the
morning
had
given
way
to
a
restlessness
and
a
strange
exaltation
of
spirit
fancy
was
quickened
imagination
heightened
to
himself
he
seemed
to
see
the
heart
of
all
things
across
his
mind
flitted
fragments
of
verse
now
a
broken
line
just
hinting
beauty
now
the
pure
passion
of
a
lovely
stanza
his
thoughts
went
to
and
fro
mobile
as
the
waves
of
the
sea
but
firm
as
the
reefs
beneath
them
stood
his
knowledge
that
presently
he
was
going
back
to
fair
view
when
the
governor
ball
was
over
when
he
could
decently
get
away
he
would
leave
the
town
he
would
go
to
his
house
in
the
country
late
flowers
bloomed
in
his
garden
the
terrace
was
fair
above
the
river
beneath
the
red
brick
wall
on
the
narrow
little
creek
shining
like
a
silver
highway
lay
a
winged
boat
and
the
highway
ran
past
a
glebe
house
and
in
the
glebe
house
dwelt
a
dryad
whose
tree
had
closed
against
her
audrey
a
fair
name
audrey
audrey
the
birds
were
singing
it
out
of
the
deep
arcadian
shadows
any
moment
it
might
come
clearly
cried
by
satyr
pan
or
shepherd
hark
there
was
song
it
was
but
a
negro
on
the
road
behind
singing
to
himself
as
he
went
about
his
master
business
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
the
race
mellow
deep
and
plaintive
perhaps
the
song
was
of
love
in
a
burning
land
he
passed
the
white
man
and
the
arching
trees
hid
him
but
the
wake
of
music
was
long
in
fading
the
road
leading
through
a
cool
and
shady
dell
haward
left
it
and
took
possession
of
the
mossy
earth
beneath
a
here
lying
on
the
ground
he
could
see
the
road
through
the
intervening
foliage
else
the
place
had
seemed
the
heart
of
an
ancient
wood
it
was
merry
lying
where
were
glimpses
of
blue
sky
where
the
leaves
quivered
and
a
squirrel
chattered
and
a
robin
sang
a
madrigal
youth
the
divine
half
way
down
the
stair
of
misty
yesterdays
turned
upon
his
heel
and
came
back
to
him
he
pillowed
his
head
upon
his
arm
and
was
content
it
was
well
to
be
so
filled
with
fancies
so
iron
of
will
so
headstrong
and
gay
to
be
friends
once
more
with
a
younger
haward
with
the
haward
of
a
mountain
pass
of
mocking
comrades
and
an
irate
excellency
from
the
road
came
a
rumble
of
oaths
sailors
sweating
and
straining
were
rolling
a
very
great
cask
of
tobacco
from
a
neighboring
warehouse
down
to
the
landing
and
some
expectant
sloop
haward
lying
at
ease
smiled
at
their
weary
task
their
grunting
and
swearing
when
they
were
gone
smiled
at
the
blankness
of
the
road
all
things
pleased
there
was
food
for
mirth
in
the
call
of
a
partridge
in
the
inquisitive
gaze
of
a
squirrel
in
the
web
of
a
spider
gaoler
to
a
gilded
fly
there
was
food
for
greater
mirth
in
the
appearance
on
the
road
of
a
solitary
figure
in
a
coat
and
bushy
black
peruke
haward
sat
up
ha
monacan
he
cried
with
a
laugh
and
threw
a
stick
to
attract
the
man
attention
hugon
turned
stood
astare
then
left
the
road
and
came
down
into
the
dell
what
fortune
trader
smiled
haward
did
your
traps
hold
in
the
great
forest
were
your
people
easy
to
fool
giving
twelve
deerskins
for
an
old
there
is
charm
in
a
woodsman
life
come
tell
me
of
your
journeys
dangers
and
escapes
the
looked
down
upon
him
with
a
twitching
face
what
hinders
me
from
killing
you
now
he
demanded
with
a
backward
look
at
the
road
none
may
pass
for
many
minutes
haward
lay
back
upon
the
moss
with
his
hands
locked
beneath
his
head
what
indeed
he
answered
calmly
come
here
is
a
velvet
log
fit
seat
for
an
emperor
or
a
sachem
sit
and
tell
me
of
your
life
in
the
woods
for
peace
pipe
let
me
offer
my
snuffbox
in
his
mad
humor
he
sat
up
again
drew
from
his
pocket
and
presented
with
the
most
approved
flourish
his
box
of
chased
gold
monsieur
le
tabac
pour
le
nez
inonarque
he
said
lazily
hugon
sat
down
upon
the
log
helped
himself
to
the
mixture
with
a
grand
air
and
shook
the
yellow
dust
from
his
ruffles
the
action
meant
to
be
airy
only
achieved
fierceness
from
some
hidden
sheath
he
drew
a
knife
and
began
to
strip
from
the
log
a
piece
of
bark
tell
me
you
he
said
have
you
been
to
france
what
manner
of
land
is
it
a
gay
country
answered
haward
a
land
where
the
men
are
all
white
and
where
at
present
periwigs
are
worn
much
shorter
than
the
one
monsieur
affects
he
is
a
great
brave
a
french
gentleman
always
he
kills
the
man
he
hates
not
always
said
the
other
sometimes
the
man
he
hates
kills
him
by
now
one
end
of
the
piece
of
bark
in
the
trader
hands
was
shredded
to
tinder
he
drew
from
his
pocket
his
flint
and
steel
and
struck
a
spark
into
the
frayed
mass
it
flared
up
and
he
held
first
the
tips
of
his
fingers
then
the
palm
of
his
hand
then
his
bared
forearm
in
the
flame
that
licked
and
scorched
the
flesh
his
face
was
perfectly
unmoved
his
eyes
unchanged
in
their
expression
of
hatred
can
he
do
this
he
asked
perhaps
not
said
haward
lightly
it
is
a
very
foolish
thing
to
do
the
flame
died
out
and
the
trader
tossed
aside
the
charred
bit
of
bark
there
was
old
pierre
at
who
taught
me
to
pray
to
bon
he
told
me
how
grand
and
fine
is
a
french
gentleman
and
that
i
was
the
son
of
many
such
he
called
the
english
great
pigs
with
brains
as
dull
and
muddy
as
the
river
after
many
rains
my
mother
was
the
daughter
of
a
chief
she
had
strings
of
pearl
for
her
neck
and
copper
for
her
arms
and
a
robe
of
white
doeskin
very
soft
and
fine
when
she
was
dead
and
my
father
was
dead
i
came
from
to
your
english
school
over
yonder
i
can
read
and
write
i
am
a
white
man
and
a
frenchman
not
an
indian
when
i
go
to
the
villages
in
the
woods
i
am
given
a
lodge
apart
and
the
men
and
women
gather
to
hear
a
white
man
speak
you
have
done
me
wrong
with
that
girl
that
audrey
that
i
wish
for
wife
we
are
enemies
that
is
as
it
should
be
you
shall
not
have
her
never
never
but
you
despise
me
how
is
that
that
day
upon
the
creek
that
night
in
your
cursed
house
you
laughed
the
haward
of
the
mountain
pass
regarding
the
twitching
face
opposite
him
and
the
hand
clenched
upon
the
handle
of
a
knife
laughed
again
at
the
sound
the
trader
face
ceased
to
twitch
haward
felt
rather
than
saw
the
stealthy
tightening
of
the
frame
the
gathering
of
forces
the
closer
grasp
upon
the
knife
and
flung
out
his
arm
a
hare
scurried
past
making
for
the
deeper
woods
from
the
road
came
the
tramp
of
a
horse
and
a
voice
singing
all
you
ladies
now
on
land
while
an
inquisitive
dog
turned
aside
from
the
road
and
plunged
into
the
dell
the
rider
having
checked
his
horse
and
quit
his
song
in
order
to
call
to
his
dog
looked
through
the
thin
veil
of
foliage
and
saw
the
two
men
beneath
the
ha
jean
hugon
he
cried
is
that
you
where
is
that
packet
of
skins
you
were
to
deliver
at
my
store
come
over
here
man
the
trader
moistened
his
dry
lips
with
his
tongue
and
slipped
the
knife
back
into
its
sheath
had
we
been
a
mile
in
the
woods
he
said
you
would
have
laughed
no
more
haward
watched
him
go
the
argument
with
the
rider
was
a
lengthy
one
he
upon
horseback
would
not
stand
still
in
the
road
to
finish
it
but
put
his
beast
into
motion
the
trader
explaining
and
gesticulating
walked
beside
his
stirrup
the
voices
grew
fainter
and
fainter
were
gone
haward
laughed
to
himself
then
with
his
eyes
raised
to
the
depth
on
depth
of
blue
serene
beyond
the
grating
of
leaves
sent
his
spirit
to
his
red
brick
house
and
silent
sunny
garden
with
the
gate
in
the
ivied
wall
and
the
six
steps
down
to
the
boat
and
the
lapping
water
the
shadows
lengthened
and
a
wind
of
the
evening
entered
the
wood
haward
shook
off
the
lethargy
that
had
kept
him
lying
there
for
the
better
part
of
an
afternoon
rose
to
his
feet
and
left
the
green
dell
for
the
road
all
shadow
now
winding
back
to
the
toy
metropolis
to
marot
ordinary
to
the
ball
at
the
palace
that
night
the
ball
at
the
palace
he
had
forgotten
it
flare
of
lights
wail
of
violins
a
painted
silken
crowd
laughter
whispers
magpie
chattering
wine
and
the
weariness
of
the
dance
when
his
soul
would
long
to
be
with
the
night
outside
with
the
rising
wind
and
the
shining
stars
he
half
determined
not
to
go
what
mattered
the
offense
that
would
be
taken
did
he
go
he
would
repent
wearied
and
ennuyé
watching
evelyn
all
moving
with
another
through
the
minuet
tied
himself
perhaps
to
some
pert
miss
or
cornered
in
a
by
boisterous
gamesters
or
drinking
with
his
peers
called
on
to
toast
the
lady
of
his
dreams
better
the
dull
room
at
marot
ordinary
or
better
still
to
order
mirza
and
ride
off
at
the
planter
pace
through
the
starshine
to
fair
view
on
the
river
bank
before
the
store
maclean
might
be
lying
dreaming
of
a
mighty
wind
and
a
fierce
death
he
would
dismount
and
sit
beside
that
highland
gentleman
jacobite
and
strong
man
and
their
moods
would
chime
as
they
had
chimed
before
then
on
to
the
house
and
to
the
eastern
window
not
but
night
perhaps
would
the
darkness
be
pierced
by
the
calm
pale
star
that
marked
another
window
it
was
all
a
mistake
that
month
at
westover
days
lost
and
wasted
the
running
of
golden
sands
ill
to
spare
from
love
brief
glass
his
mood
had
changed
when
with
the
gathering
dusk
he
entered
his
room
at
marot
ordinary
he
would
go
to
the
palace
that
night
it
would
be
the
act
of
a
boy
to
fling
away
through
the
darkness
shirking
a
duty
his
position
demanded
he
would
go
and
be
merry
watching
evelyn
in
the
gown
that
peterborough
had
praised
when
juba
had
lighted
the
candles
he
sat
and
drank
and
drank
again
of
the
red
wine
upon
the
table
it
put
maggots
in
his
brain
fired
and
flushed
him
to
the
spirit
core
an
idea
came
at
which
he
laughed
he
bade
it
go
but
it
would
not
it
stayed
and
his
fevered
fancy
played
around
it
as
a
moth
around
a
candle
at
first
he
knew
it
for
a
notion
bizarre
and
absurd
which
presently
he
would
dismiss
all
day
strange
thoughts
had
come
and
gone
appearing
disappearing
like
for
which
a
man
upon
a
firm
road
has
no
care
never
fear
that
he
will
follow
them
he
sees
the
marsh
that
it
has
no
footing
so
with
this
conception
it
would
vanish
as
it
came
it
did
not
so
instead
when
he
had
drunken
more
wine
and
had
sat
for
some
time
methodically
measuring
over
and
over
again
with
thumb
and
forefinger
the
distance
from
candle
to
bottle
and
from
bottle
to
glass
the
idea
began
to
lose
its
wildfire
aspect
in
no
great
time
it
appeared
an
inspiration
as
reasonable
as
happy
when
this
point
had
been
reached
he
stamped
upon
the
floor
to
summon
his
servant
from
the
room
below
lay
out
the
white
and
gold
juba
he
ordered
when
the
negro
appeared
and
come
make
me
very
fine
i
am
for
the
palace
i
and
a
brown
lady
that
hath
bewitched
me
the
white
sword
knot
sirrah
and
cock
my
hat
with
the
diamond
brooch
it
was
a
night
that
was
thronged
with
stars
and
visited
by
a
whispering
wind
haward
walking
rapidly
along
the
almost
deserted
nicholson
street
lifted
his
burning
forehead
to
the
cool
air
and
the
fields
of
heaven
coming
to
the
gate
by
which
he
had
entered
the
afternoon
before
he
raised
the
latch
and
passed
into
the
garden
by
now
his
fever
was
full
upon
him
and
it
was
a
man
scarce
to
be
held
responsible
for
his
actions
that
presently
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
long
room
where
at
the
window
opening
upon
palace
street
audrey
sat
with
mistress
stagg
and
watched
the
people
going
to
the
ball
chapter
xix
the
governor
ball
for
an
hour
it
had
been
very
quiet
very
peaceful
in
the
small
white
house
on
palace
street
darden
was
not
there
for
the
commissary
had
sent
for
him
having
certain
inquiries
to
make
and
a
stern
warning
to
deliver
mistress
deborah
had
been
asked
to
spend
the
night
with
an
acquaintance
in
the
town
so
she
also
was
out
and
gone
mistress
stagg
and
audrey
kept
the
lower
rooms
while
overhead
charles
stagg
a
man
that
loved
his
art
walked
up
and
down
and
with
many
wavings
of
a
laced
handkerchief
and
much
resort
to
a
gilt
snuffbox
reasoned
with
plato
of
death
and
the
soul
the
murmur
of
his
voice
came
down
to
the
two
women
and
made
the
only
sound
in
the
house
audrey
sitting
by
the
window
her
chin
upon
her
hand
and
her
dark
hair
shadowing
her
face
looked
out
upon
the
dooryard
and
the
palace
street
beyond
the
street
was
lit
by
torches
and
people
were
going
to
the
ball
in
coaches
and
chariots
on
foot
and
in
painted
chairs
they
went
gayly
light
of
heart
fine
of
person
a
free
and
generous
folk
laughter
floated
over
to
the
silent
watcher
and
the
torchlight
gave
her
glimpses
of
another
land
than
her
own
many
had
been
mistress
stagg
customers
since
morning
and
something
had
she
heard
besides
admiration
of
her
wares
and
exclamation
at
her
prices
now
as
she
sat
with
some
gay
sewing
beneath
her
nimble
fingers
she
glanced
once
and
again
at
the
shadowed
face
opposite
her
if
the
look
was
not
one
of
curiosity
alone
but
had
in
it
an
admixture
of
respect
if
to
mistress
stagg
the
audrey
of
yesterday
unnoted
unwhispered
of
was
a
being
somewhat
lowlier
than
the
audrey
of
it
may
be
remembered
for
her
that
she
was
an
actress
of
the
early
eighteenth
century
and
that
fate
and
an
old
mother
to
support
had
put
her
in
that
station
the
candles
beneath
their
glass
shades
burned
steadily
the
house
grew
very
quiet
the
noises
of
the
street
lessened
and
lessened
for
now
nearly
all
of
the
people
were
gone
to
the
ball
audrey
watched
the
round
of
light
cast
by
the
nearest
torch
for
a
long
time
she
had
watched
it
thinking
that
he
might
perhaps
cross
the
circle
and
she
might
see
him
in
his
splendor
she
was
still
watching
when
he
knocked
at
the
garden
door
mistress
stagg
sitting
in
a
dream
of
her
own
started
violently
la
now
who
may
that
be
she
exclaimed
go
to
the
door
child
if
is
a
stranger
we
shelter
none
such
to
be
taken
up
for
the
harboring
of
runaways
audrey
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
a
moment
pause
a
low
cry
and
she
moved
backward
to
the
wall
where
she
stood
with
her
slender
form
sharply
drawn
against
the
white
plaster
and
with
the
fugitive
elusive
charm
of
her
face
quickened
into
absolute
beauty
imperious
for
attention
haward
thus
ushered
into
the
room
gave
the
face
its
due
his
eyes
bright
and
fixed
were
for
it
alone
mistress
stagg
curtsy
went
unacknowledged
save
by
a
slight
mechanical
motion
of
his
hand
and
her
inquiry
as
to
what
he
lacked
that
she
could
supply
received
no
answer
he
was
a
very
handsome
man
of
a
bearing
both
easy
and
commanding
and
he
was
splendidly
dressed
in
white
satin
with
embroidery
of
gold
to
one
of
the
women
he
seemed
the
king
who
could
do
no
wrong
to
the
other
more
learned
in
the
book
of
the
world
he
was
merely
a
fine
gentleman
whose
way
might
as
well
be
given
him
at
once
since
spite
of
denial
he
would
presently
take
it
haward
sat
down
resting
his
clasped
hands
upon
the
table
gazing
steadfastly
at
the
face
dark
and
beautiful
set
like
a
flower
against
the
wall
come
little
maid
he
said
we
are
going
to
the
ball
together
you
and
hasten
or
we
shall
not
be
in
time
for
the
minuet
audrey
smiled
and
shook
her
head
thinking
that
it
was
his
pleasure
to
laugh
at
her
a
little
mistress
stagg
likewise
showed
her
appreciation
of
the
pleasantry
when
he
repeated
his
command
speaking
in
an
authoritative
tone
and
with
a
glance
at
his
watch
there
was
a
moment
of
dead
silence
then
go
your
ways
sir
and
dance
with
mistress
evelyn
byrd
cried
the
scandalized
the
governor
ball
is
not
for
the
likes
of
audrey
i
will
be
judge
of
that
he
answered
come
let
us
be
off
child
or
stay
hast
no
other
dress
than
that
he
looked
toward
the
mistress
of
the
house
i
warrant
that
mistress
stagg
can
trick
you
out
i
would
have
you
go
fine
audrey
of
the
hair
audrey
of
the
eyes
audrey
of
the
full
brown
throat
dull
gold
have
you
that
now
mistress
in
damask
or
brocade
soft
laces
for
her
bosom
and
a
yellow
bloom
in
her
hair
it
should
be
dogwood
audrey
like
the
coronal
you
wore
on
may
day
do
you
remember
child
the
white
stars
in
your
hair
and
the
maypole
all
aflutter
and
your
feet
upon
the
green
grass
oh
i
was
happy
then
cried
audrey
and
wrung
her
hands
within
a
moment
however
she
was
calm
again
and
could
look
at
him
with
a
smile
i
am
only
audrey
she
said
you
know
that
the
ball
is
not
for
me
why
then
do
you
tell
me
that
i
must
go
it
is
your
kindness
i
know
that
it
is
your
kindness
that
speaks
but
yet
but
yet
she
gazed
at
him
imploringly
then
from
his
steady
smile
caught
a
sudden
encouragement
oh
she
exclaimed
with
a
gesture
of
quick
relief
and
with
tremulous
laughter
in
her
face
and
voice
oh
you
are
mocking
me
you
only
came
to
show
how
a
gentleman
looks
who
goes
to
a
governor
ball
for
the
moment
in
her
relief
at
having
read
his
riddle
there
slipped
from
her
the
fear
of
she
knew
not
what
the
strangeness
and
heaviness
of
heart
that
had
been
her
portion
since
she
came
to
williamsburgh
leaving
the
white
wall
against
which
she
had
leaned
she
came
a
little
forward
and
with
gayety
and
grace
dropped
him
a
curtsy
oh
the
white
satin
like
the
lilies
in
your
garden
she
laughed
and
the
red
heels
to
your
shoes
and
the
sword
knot
and
the
velvet
scabbard
ah
let
me
see
your
sword
how
bright
and
keen
it
is
she
was
audrey
of
the
garden
and
haward
smiling
drew
his
rapier
and
laid
it
in
her
hands
she
looked
at
the
golden
hilt
and
passed
her
brown
fingers
along
the
gleaming
blade
stainless
she
said
and
gave
it
back
to
him
taking
it
he
took
also
the
hand
that
had
proffered
it
i
was
not
laughing
child
he
said
go
to
the
ball
thou
shalt
and
with
me
what
thou
art
young
and
fair
shalt
have
no
pleasure
what
pleasure
in
that
cried
audrey
i
may
not
go
sir
nay
i
will
not
go
she
freed
her
hand
and
stood
with
heaving
bosom
and
eyes
that
very
slowly
filled
with
tears
haward
saw
no
reason
for
her
tears
it
was
true
that
she
was
young
and
fair
true
also
that
she
had
few
pleasures
well
he
would
change
all
that
the
dance
was
it
not
woven
by
those
nymphs
of
old
those
sprites
of
open
spaces
in
the
deep
woods
from
whose
immemorial
company
she
must
have
strayed
into
this
present
time
now
at
the
palace
the
candles
were
burning
for
her
for
her
the
music
was
playing
her
welcome
there
amidst
the
tinsel
people
trust
him
for
that
he
was
what
he
was
and
could
compass
greater
things
than
that
would
be
go
she
should
because
it
pleased
him
to
please
her
and
because
it
was
certainly
necessary
for
him
to
oppose
pride
with
pride
and
before
the
eyes
of
evelyn
demonstrate
his
indifference
to
that
lady
choice
of
lee
for
the
minuet
and
lightfoot
for
the
country
dance
this
last
thought
had
far
to
travel
from
some
unused
quagmire
of
the
heart
but
it
came
for
the
rest
the
image
of
audrey
decked
in
silk
and
lace
turned
by
her
apparel
into
a
dark
court
lady
a
damsel
in
waiting
to
queen
titania
caught
his
fancy
in
both
hands
he
wished
to
see
her
thus
wished
it
so
strongly
that
he
knew
it
would
come
to
pass
he
was
a
gentleman
who
had
acquired
the
habit
of
having
his
own
way
there
had
been
times
when
the
price
of
his
way
had
seemed
too
dear
when
he
had
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
ceased
to
desire
what
he
would
not
buy
he
was
not
able
to
count
the
cost
but
he
knew
he
knew
cruelly
well
how
to
cut
short
this
fruitless
protest
of
a
young
girl
who
thought
him
all
that
was
wise
and
great
and
good
so
you
can
not
say
to
my
asking
little
maid
he
began
quiet
and
smiling
can
not
trust
me
that
i
have
reasons
for
the
asking
well
i
will
not
ask
again
audrey
since
it
is
so
great
a
thing
oh
cried
audrey
you
know
that
i
would
die
for
you
the
tears
welled
over
but
she
brushed
them
away
with
a
trembling
hand
then
stood
with
raised
face
her
eyes
soft
and
dewy
a
strange
smile
upon
her
lips
she
spoke
at
last
as
simply
as
a
child
why
you
want
me
that
am
only
audrey
to
go
with
you
to
the
palace
yonder
i
can
not
tell
but
i
will
go
though
i
am
only
audrey
and
i
have
no
other
dress
than
this
haward
got
unsteadily
to
his
feet
and
lightly
touched
the
dark
head
that
she
bowed
upon
her
hands
why
now
you
are
audrey
again
he
said
approvingly
why
child
i
would
do
you
a
pleasure
he
turned
to
the
player
wife
she
must
not
go
in
this
guise
have
you
no
finery
stowed
away
now
mistress
stagg
though
much
scandalized
and
very
certain
that
all
this
would
never
do
was
in
her
way
an
artist
and
could
see
as
in
a
mirror
what
bare
throat
and
shoulders
rich
hair
drawn
loosely
up
a
touch
of
rouge
a
patch
or
two
a
silken
gown
might
achieve
for
audrey
and
after
all
had
not
deborah
told
her
that
the
girl
was
haward
ward
not
darden
and
that
though
haward
came
and
went
as
he
pleased
and
was
very
kind
to
audrey
so
that
darden
was
sure
of
getting
whatever
the
girl
asked
for
yet
she
was
a
good
girl
and
there
was
no
harm
for
the
talk
that
day
people
were
very
idle
and
given
to
thinking
the
forest
afire
when
there
was
only
the
least
curl
of
smoke
and
in
short
and
finally
it
was
none
of
her
business
but
with
the
aid
of
a
certain
chest
upstairs
she
knew
what
she
could
do
to
the
ball
might
go
a
beauty
would
make
mistress
evelyn
byrd
look
to
her
laurels
there
the
birthday
dress
that
madam
carter
sent
us
only
last
week
she
began
hesitatingly
it
very
beautiful
and
as
good
as
new
and
suit
you
to
a
miracle
but
i
vow
you
must
not
go
audrey
to
be
sure
the
damask
is
just
the
tint
for
you
and
there
are
roses
would
answer
for
your
hair
but
la
sir
you
know
never
do
never
in
this
world
half
an
hour
later
haward
rose
from
his
chair
and
bowed
low
as
to
some
highborn
and
puissant
dame
the
fever
that
was
now
running
high
in
his
veins
flushed
his
cheek
and
made
his
eyes
exceedingly
bright
when
he
went
up
to
audrey
and
in
graceful
mockery
of
her
sudden
coming
into
her
kingdom
took
her
hand
and
bending
kissed
it
the
picture
that
they
made
cried
out
for
some
painter
to
preserve
it
her
hand
dropped
from
his
clasp
and
buried
itself
in
rich
folds
of
flowered
damask
the
quick
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
stirred
soft
yellowing
laces
and
made
to
flash
like
diamonds
some
ornaments
of
marcasite
her
face
was
haunting
in
its
pain
and
bewilderment
and
great
beauty
and
in
the
lie
which
her
eyes
gave
to
the
false
roses
beneath
those
homes
of
sadness
and
longing
she
had
no
word
to
say
she
was
only
audrey
and
she
could
not
understand
but
she
wished
to
do
his
bidding
and
so
when
he
cried
out
upon
her
melancholy
and
asked
her
if
indeed
a
sunday
in
new
england
instead
of
a
saturday
in
virginia
she
smiled
and
strove
to
put
on
the
mind
as
well
as
the
garb
of
a
gay
lady
who
might
justly
go
to
the
governor
ball
half
frightened
at
her
own
success
mistress
stagg
hovered
around
her
giving
this
or
that
final
touch
to
her
costume
but
it
was
haward
himself
who
put
the
roses
in
her
hair
a
little
longer
and
we
will
walk
once
more
in
my
garden
at
fair
view
he
said
june
shall
come
again
for
us
and
we
will
tread
the
quiet
paths
my
sweet
and
all
the
roses
shall
bloom
again
for
us
there
you
are
crowned
hail
queen
audrey
felt
the
touch
of
his
lips
upon
her
forehead
and
shivered
all
her
world
was
going
round
she
could
not
steady
it
could
not
see
aright
knew
not
what
was
happening
the
strangeness
made
her
dizzy
she
hardly
heard
mistress
stagg
last
protest
that
it
would
never
do
never
in
the
world
hardly
knew
when
she
left
the
house
she
was
out
beneath
the
stars
moving
toward
a
lit
palace
whence
came
the
sound
of
violins
haward
arm
was
beneath
her
hand
his
voice
was
in
her
ear
but
it
was
as
the
voice
whose
speech
she
did
not
understand
suddenly
they
were
within
the
palace
garden
with
its
winding
torchlit
walks
and
the
terraces
at
the
side
suddenly
again
they
had
mounted
the
palace
steps
and
the
doors
were
open
and
she
was
confronted
with
lights
and
music
and
shifting
dazzling
figures
she
stood
still
clasped
her
hands
and
gave
haward
a
piteous
look
her
face
for
all
its
beauty
and
its
painted
roses
was
strangely
the
child
face
that
had
lain
upon
his
breast
where
he
knelt
amid
the
corn
in
the
valley
between
the
hills
so
long
ago
he
gave
her
mute
appeal
no
heed
the
governor
guests
passing
from
room
to
room
crossed
and
recrossed
the
wide
hall
and
down
the
stairway
to
meet
a
row
of
gallants
impatient
at
its
foot
came
fair
women
one
after
the
other
the
flower
of
the
colony
clothed
upon
like
the
lilies
of
old
haward
entering
with
audrey
saw
lee
at
the
stairfoot
and
raising
his
eyes
was
aware
of
evelyn
descending
alone
and
somewhat
slowly
all
in
rose
color
and
with
a
smile
upon
her
lips
she
was
esteemed
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
virginia
the
most
graceful
and
accomplished
wit
and
charm
and
fortune
were
hers
and
the
little
gay
world
of
virginia
had
mated
her
with
marmaduke
haward
of
fair
view
therefore
that
portion
of
it
that
chanced
to
be
in
the
hall
of
the
governor
house
withdrew
for
the
moment
its
attention
from
its
own
affairs
and
bestowed
it
upon
those
of
the
lady
descending
the
stairs
and
of
the
gentleman
who
with
a
strange
beauty
at
his
side
stood
directly
in
her
path
it
was
a
very
wise
little
world
and
since
yesterday
afternoon
had
been
fairly
bursting
with
its
own
knowledge
it
knew
all
about
that
gypsy
who
had
come
to
town
from
fair
view
parish
la
my
dear
just
the
servant
of
a
minister
and
knew
to
a
syllable
what
had
passed
in
the
violent
quarrel
to
which
lee
owed
his
good
fortune
illustration
i
do
not
think
i
have
the
honor
of
knowing
that
triumphant
gentleman
now
started
forward
and
with
a
low
bow
extended
his
hand
to
lead
to
the
ballroom
this
paragon
and
cynosure
of
all
eyes
evelyn
smiled
upon
him
and
gave
him
her
scarf
to
hold
but
would
not
be
hurried
must
first
speak
to
her
old
friend
haward
and
tell
him
that
her
father
foot
could
now
bear
the
shoe
and
that
he
might
appear
before
the
ball
was
over
this
done
she
withdrew
her
gaze
from
haward
strangely
animated
vividly
handsome
countenance
and
turned
it
upon
the
figure
at
his
side
pray
present
me
she
said
quickly
i
do
not
think
i
have
the
honor
of
knowing
audrey
raised
her
head
that
had
been
bent
and
looked
again
as
she
had
looked
yesterday
with
all
her
innocent
soul
and
heavy
heart
into
the
eyes
of
the
princess
the
smile
died
from
evelyn
lips
and
a
great
wave
of
indignant
red
surged
over
face
and
neck
and
bosom
the
color
fled
but
not
the
bitter
anger
so
he
could
bring
his
fancy
there
could
clothe
her
that
was
a
servant
wench
in
a
splendid
gown
and
flaunt
her
before
the
world
before
the
world
that
must
know
oh
god
must
know
how
she
herself
loved
him
he
could
do
this
after
that
month
at
westover
she
drew
her
breath
and
met
the
insult
fairly
i
withdraw
my
petition
she
said
clearly
now
that
i
bethink
me
my
acquaintance
is
already
somewhat
too
great
lee
shall
we
not
join
the
company
i
have
yet
to
make
my
curtsy
to
his
excellency
with
head
erect
and
with
no
attention
to
spare
from
the
happy
lee
she
passed
the
sometime
suitor
for
her
hand
and
the
apple
of
discord
which
it
had
pleased
him
to
throw
into
the
assembly
a
whisper
ran
around
the
hall
audrey
heard
suppressed
laughter
and
heard
a
speech
which
she
did
not
understand
but
which
was
uttered
in
an
angry
voice
much
like
mistress
deborah
when
she
chided
a
sudden
terror
of
herself
and
of
haward
world
possessed
her
she
turned
where
she
stood
in
her
borrowed
plumage
and
clung
to
his
hand
and
arm
let
me
go
she
begged
it
is
all
a
mistake
all
wrong
let
me
go
let
me
go
he
laughed
at
her
shaking
his
head
and
looking
into
her
beseeching
face
with
shining
eyes
thou
dear
fool
he
said
the
ball
is
made
for
thee
and
all
these
folk
are
here
to
do
thee
honor
holding
her
by
the
hand
he
moved
with
her
toward
a
wide
doorway
through
which
could
be
seen
a
greater
throng
of
beautifully
dressed
ladies
and
gentlemen
music
came
from
this
room
and
she
saw
that
there
were
dancers
and
that
beyond
them
upon
a
sort
of
dais
and
before
a
great
carved
chair
stood
a
fine
gentleman
who
she
knew
must
be
his
excellency
the
governor
of
virginia
chapter
xx
the
uninvited
guest
mistress
audrey
said
the
governor
graciously
as
the
lady
in
damask
rose
from
her
curtsy
mistress
audrey
whom
haward
you
gave
me
not
the
name
of
the
stock
that
hath
flowered
in
so
beauteous
a
bloom
why
sir
the
bloom
is
all
in
all
answered
haward
what
root
it
springs
from
matters
not
i
trust
that
your
excellency
is
in
good
health
that
you
feel
no
touch
of
our
seasoning
fever
i
asked
the
lady
name
sir
said
the
governor
pointedly
he
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
a
knot
of
gentlemen
members
of
the
council
and
officers
of
the
colony
all
around
the
long
room
seated
in
chairs
arow
against
the
walls
or
gathered
in
laughing
groups
or
moving
about
with
a
rustle
and
gleam
of
silk
were
the
virginians
his
guests
from
the
gallery
where
were
bestowed
the
musicians
out
of
three
parishes
floated
the
pensive
strains
of
a
minuet
and
in
the
centre
of
the
polished
floor
under
the
eyes
of
the
company
several
couples
moved
and
postured
through
that
stately
dance
the
lady
is
my
ward
said
haward
lightly
i
call
her
audrey
child
tell
his
excellency
your
other
name
if
he
thought
at
all
he
thought
that
she
could
do
it
but
such
an
estray
such
a
piece
of
flotsam
was
audrey
that
she
could
not
help
him
out
they
call
me
darden
audrey
she
explained
to
the
governor
if
i
ever
heard
my
father
name
i
have
forgotten
it
her
voice
though
low
reached
all
those
who
had
ceased
from
their
own
concerns
to
stare
at
this
strange
guest
this
shrinking
beauty
so
radiantly
attired
the
whisper
had
preceded
her
from
the
hall
there
had
been
fluttering
and
comment
enough
as
under
the
fire
of
all
those
eyes
she
had
passed
with
haward
to
where
stood
the
governor
receiving
his
guests
but
the
whisper
had
not
reached
his
excellency
ears
in
london
he
had
been
slightly
acquainted
with
marmaduke
haward
and
now
knew
him
for
a
member
of
his
council
and
a
gentleman
of
much
consequence
in
that
virginia
which
he
had
come
to
rule
moreover
he
had
that
very
morning
granted
a
favor
to
haward
and
by
reason
thereof
was
inclined
to
think
amiably
of
the
gentleman
of
the
piece
of
dark
loveliness
whom
the
virginian
had
brought
forward
to
present
who
could
think
otherwise
but
his
excellency
was
a
formal
man
punctilious
and
cautious
of
his
state
the
bow
with
which
he
received
the
strange
lady
curtsy
had
been
profound
in
speaking
to
her
he
had
made
his
tones
while
his
compliment
quite
capped
the
one
just
paid
to
mistress
evelyn
byrd
and
now
it
would
appear
that
the
lady
had
no
name
nay
from
the
looks
that
were
being
exchanged
and
from
the
tittering
that
had
risen
amongst
the
younger
of
his
guests
there
must
be
more
amiss
than
that
his
excellency
frowned
drew
himself
up
and
turned
what
was
meant
to
be
a
searching
and
terrible
eye
upon
the
recreant
in
white
satin
audrey
caught
the
look
for
which
haward
cared
no
whit
oh
she
knew
that
she
had
no
business
there
she
that
only
the
other
day
had
gone
barefoot
on
darden
errands
had
been
kept
waiting
in
hall
or
kitchen
of
these
people
houses
she
knew
that
for
all
her
silken
gown
she
had
no
place
among
them
but
she
thought
that
they
were
not
kind
to
stare
and
whisper
and
laugh
shaming
her
before
one
another
and
before
him
her
heart
swelled
to
the
dreamy
misery
of
the
day
and
evening
was
added
a
passionate
sense
of
hurt
and
wrong
and
injustice
her
pride
awoke
and
in
a
moment
taught
her
many
things
though
among
them
was
no
distrust
of
him
brought
to
bay
she
put
out
her
hand
and
found
a
gate
pushed
it
open
and
entered
upon
her
heritage
of
art
the
change
was
so
sudden
that
those
who
had
stared
at
her
sourly
or
scornfully
or
with
malicious
amusement
or
some
stirrings
of
pity
drew
their
breath
and
gave
ground
a
little
where
was
the
shrinking
frightened
unbidden
guest
of
a
moment
before
with
downcast
eyes
and
burning
cheeks
here
was
a
proud
and
easy
and
radiant
lady
with
witching
eyes
and
a
wonderful
smile
i
am
only
audrey
your
excellency
she
said
and
curtsied
as
she
spoke
my
other
name
lies
buried
in
a
valley
amongst
mountains
she
slightly
turned
and
addressed
herself
to
a
portly
gentleman
of
a
very
authoritative
air
who
arriving
late
had
just
shouldered
himself
into
the
group
about
his
excellency
by
token
she
smiled
of
a
gold
moidore
that
was
paid
for
a
loaf
of
bread
the
new
governor
appealed
to
his
predecessor
what
is
this
colonel
spotswood
what
is
this
he
demanded
somewhat
testily
of
the
gentleman
in
velvet
odso
cried
the
latter
is
the
little
maid
of
the
marmaduke
haward
brown
elf
grown
into
the
queen
of
all
the
fairies
crossing
to
audrey
he
took
her
by
the
hand
my
dear
child
he
said
with
a
benevolence
that
sat
well
upon
him
i
always
meant
to
keep
an
eye
upon
thee
to
see
that
haward
did
by
thee
all
that
he
swore
he
would
do
but
at
first
there
were
cares
of
state
and
now
for
five
years
i
have
lived
at
germanna
half
way
to
thy
mountains
where
echoes
from
the
world
seldom
reach
me
permit
me
my
dear
with
a
somewhat
cumbrous
gallantry
the
innocent
gentleman
who
had
just
come
to
town
and
knew
not
the
gossip
thereof
bent
and
kissed
her
upon
the
cheek
audrey
curtsied
with
a
bright
face
to
her
old
acquaintance
of
the
valley
and
the
long
road
thence
to
the
settled
country
i
have
been
cared
for
sir
she
said
you
see
that
i
am
happy
she
turned
to
haward
and
he
drew
her
hand
within
his
arm
ay
child
he
said
we
are
keeping
others
of
the
company
from
their
duty
to
his
excellency
besides
the
minuet
invites
i
do
not
think
i
have
heard
music
so
sweet
before
your
excellency
most
obedient
servant
gentlemen
allow
us
to
pass
the
crowd
opened
before
them
and
they
found
themselves
in
the
centre
of
the
room
two
couples
were
walking
a
minuet
when
they
were
joined
by
this
dazzling
third
the
ladies
bridled
bit
their
lips
and
shot
parthian
glances
it
was
very
fortunate
thought
audrey
that
the
widow
constance
had
once
long
ago
taught
her
to
dance
and
that
when
they
were
sent
to
gather
nuts
or
myrtle
berries
or
fagots
in
the
woods
she
and
barbara
were
used
to
taking
hands
beneath
the
trees
and
moving
with
the
glancing
sunbeams
and
the
nodding
saplings
and
the
swaying
grapevine
trailers
she
that
had
danced
to
the
wind
in
the
pine
tops
could
move
with
ease
to
the
music
of
this
night
and
since
it
was
so
that
with
a
sore
and
frightened
and
breaking
heart
one
could
yet
in
some
strange
way
become
quite
another
person
any
person
that
one
chose
to
be
these
cruel
folk
should
not
laugh
at
her
again
they
had
not
laughed
since
before
the
governor
yonder
she
had
suddenly
made
believe
that
she
was
a
carefree
great
lady
well
she
would
make
believe
to
them
still
her
eyes
were
as
brilliant
as
haward
that
shone
with
fever
a
smile
stayed
upon
her
lips
she
moved
with
dignity
through
the
stately
dance
scarce
erring
once
graceful
and
fine
in
all
that
she
did
haward
enamored
his
wits
afire
went
mechanically
through
the
measure
and
swore
to
himself
that
he
held
in
his
hand
the
pearl
of
price
the
nonpareil
of
earth
in
this
dance
and
under
cover
of
the
music
they
could
speak
to
each
other
unheard
of
those
about
them
of
all
the
fairies
did
he
call
you
he
asked
that
was
well
said
when
we
are
at
fair
view
again
thou
must
show
me
where
thou
wonnest
with
thy
court
in
what
moonlit
haunt
by
what
cool
stream
i
would
i
were
this
night
at
fair
view
glebe
house
said
audrey
i
would
i
were
at
home
in
the
mountains
her
voice
sunken
with
pain
and
longing
was
for
him
alone
to
the
other
dancers
to
the
crowded
room
at
large
she
seemed
a
brazen
girl
with
beauty
to
make
a
goddess
wit
to
mask
as
a
great
lady
effrontery
to
match
that
of
the
gentleman
who
had
brought
her
here
the
age
was
free
and
in
that
london
which
was
dear
to
the
hearts
of
the
virginians
ladies
of
damaged
reputation
were
not
so
unusual
a
feature
of
fashionable
entertainments
as
to
receive
any
especial
notice
but
williamsburgh
was
not
london
and
the
dancer
yonder
who
held
her
head
so
high
was
no
lady
of
fashion
they
knew
her
now
for
that
dweller
at
fair
view
gates
of
whom
during
the
summer
just
past
there
had
been
whispering
enough
evidently
it
was
not
for
naught
that
marmaduke
haward
had
refused
invitations
given
no
entertainments
shut
himself
up
at
fair
view
slighting
old
friends
and
evincing
no
desire
to
make
new
ones
why
the
girl
was
a
servant
nothing
more
nor
less
she
belonged
to
gideon
darden
the
drunken
minister
she
was
to
have
married
jean
hugon
the
trader
look
how
the
governor
enlightened
at
last
glowered
at
her
and
how
red
was
colonel
spotswood
face
and
how
mistress
evelyn
byrd
sitting
in
the
midst
of
a
little
court
of
her
own
made
witty
talk
smiled
upon
her
circle
of
adorers
and
never
glanced
toward
the
centre
of
the
room
and
the
dancers
there
you
are
so
sweet
and
gay
said
haward
to
audrey
take
your
pleasure
child
for
it
is
a
sad
world
and
the
blight
will
fall
i
love
to
see
you
happy
happy
she
answered
i
am
not
happy
you
are
above
them
all
in
beauty
he
went
on
there
is
not
one
here
that
fit
to
tie
your
shoe
oh
me
cried
audrey
there
is
the
lady
that
you
love
and
that
loves
you
why
did
she
look
at
me
so
in
the
hall
yonder
and
yesterday
when
she
came
to
mistress
stagg
i
might
not
touch
her
or
speak
to
her
you
told
me
that
she
was
kind
and
good
and
pitiful
i
dreamed
that
she
might
let
me
serve
her
when
she
came
to
fair
view
she
will
never
come
to
fair
view
he
said
nor
shall
i
go
again
to
westover
i
am
for
my
own
house
now
you
brown
enchantress
and
my
own
garden
and
the
boat
upon
the
river
do
you
remember
how
sweet
were
our
days
in
june
we
will
live
them
over
again
and
there
shall
come
for
us
besides
a
fuller
summer
it
is
winter
now
said
audrey
with
a
sobbing
breath
and
cold
and
dark
i
do
not
know
myself
and
you
are
strange
i
beg
you
to
let
me
go
away
i
wish
to
wash
off
this
paint
to
put
on
my
own
gown
i
am
no
lady
you
do
wrong
to
keep
me
here
see
all
the
company
are
frowning
at
me
the
minister
will
hear
what
i
have
done
and
be
angry
and
mistress
deborah
will
beat
me
i
care
not
for
that
but
you
oh
you
have
gone
far
away
as
far
as
fair
view
as
far
as
the
mountains
i
am
speaking
to
a
stranger
in
the
dance
their
raised
hands
met
again
you
see
me
you
speak
to
me
at
last
he
said
ardently
that
other
that
cold
brother
of
the
snows
that
paladin
and
dream
knight
that
you
yourself
made
and
dubbed
him
me
he
has
gone
audrey
nay
he
never
was
but
i
myself
i
am
not
abhorrent
to
you
oh
she
answered
it
is
all
dark
i
can
not
see
i
can
not
understand
the
time
allotted
to
minuets
having
elapsed
the
musicians
after
a
short
pause
began
to
play
an
ancient
lively
air
and
a
number
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
young
gayly
dressed
and
light
of
heart
as
of
heels
engaged
in
a
country
dance
when
they
were
joined
by
marmaduke
haward
and
his
shameless
companion
there
arose
a
great
rustling
and
whispering
a
young
girl
in
green
taffeta
was
dancing
alone
wreathing
in
and
out
between
the
silken
gleaming
couples
coquetting
with
the
men
by
means
of
fan
and
eyes
but
taking
hands
and
moving
a
step
or
two
with
each
sister
of
the
dance
when
she
approached
audrey
the
latter
smiled
and
extended
her
hand
because
that
was
the
way
the
lady
nearest
her
had
done
but
the
girl
in
green
stared
coldly
put
her
hand
behind
her
and
with
the
very
faintest
salute
to
marmaduke
haward
danced
on
her
way
for
one
moment
the
smile
died
on
audrey
lips
then
it
came
resolutely
back
and
she
held
her
head
high
the
men
forming
in
two
rows
drew
their
rapiers
with
a
flourish
and
crossing
them
overhead
made
an
arch
of
steel
under
which
the
women
must
pass
haward
blade
touched
that
of
an
old
acquaintance
i
have
been
leaning
upon
the
back
of
a
lady
chair
said
the
latter
gruffly
under
cover
of
the
music
and
the
clashing
steel
a
lady
dressed
in
rose
color
who
as
generous
to
all
save
one
poor
devil
as
she
is
fair
i
promised
her
i
would
take
her
message
the
lord
knows
i
would
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
to
give
her
pleasure
she
says
that
you
are
not
yourself
begs
that
you
will
go
quietly
away
an
exclamation
from
the
man
next
him
and
a
loud
murmur
mixed
with
some
laughter
from
those
in
the
crowded
room
who
were
watching
the
dancers
caused
the
gentleman
to
break
off
in
the
middle
of
his
message
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
then
with
a
shrug
turned
to
his
in
white
satin
now
you
see
that
not
answer
not
in
virginia
the
women
bless
them
have
a
way
of
cutting
gordian
knots
a
score
of
ladies
one
treading
in
the
footsteps
of
another
should
have
passed
beneath
the
flashing
swords
but
there
had
thrust
itself
into
their
company
a
plague
spot
and
the
girl
in
green
taffeta
and
a
matron
in
silver
brocade
between
whom
stood
the
hateful
presence
indignantly
stepped
out
of
line
and
declined
to
dance
the
fear
of
infection
spreading
like
wildfire
the
ranks
refused
to
close
and
the
company
was
thrown
into
confusion
suddenly
the
girl
in
green
by
nature
a
leader
of
her
kind
walked
away
with
a
toss
of
her
head
from
the
huddle
of
those
who
were
uncertain
what
to
do
and
joined
her
friends
among
the
spectators
who
received
her
with
acclaim
the
sound
and
her
example
were
warranty
enough
for
the
cohort
she
had
quitted
a
moment
and
it
was
in
virtuous
retreat
and
the
dance
was
broken
up
the
gentlemen
who
saw
themselves
summarily
deserted
abruptly
lowered
their
swords
one
laughed
another
flown
with
wine
gave
utterance
to
some
coarse
pleasantry
a
third
called
to
the
musicians
to
stop
the
music
darden
audrey
stood
alone
brave
in
her
beautiful
borrowed
dress
and
the
color
that
could
not
leave
her
cheeks
but
her
lips
had
whitened
the
smile
was
gone
and
her
eyes
were
like
those
of
a
hunted
deer
she
looked
mutely
about
her
how
could
she
understand
who
trusted
so
completely
who
lived
in
a
labyrinth
without
a
clue
who
had
built
her
dream
world
so
securely
that
she
had
left
no
way
of
egress
for
herself
these
were
cruel
people
she
was
mad
to
get
away
to
tear
off
this
strange
dress
to
fling
herself
down
in
the
darkness
in
the
woods
hiding
her
face
against
the
earth
but
though
she
was
only
audrey
and
so
poor
a
thing
she
had
for
her
portion
a
dignity
and
fineness
of
nature
that
was
a
stay
to
her
steps
barbara
though
not
so
poor
and
humble
a
maid
might
have
burst
into
tears
and
run
crying
from
the
room
and
the
house
but
to
do
that
audrey
would
have
been
ashamed
it
was
you
corbin
that
laughed
i
think
said
haward
i
shall
send
to
know
the
reason
of
your
mirth
everard
you
will
answer
to
me
for
that
pretty
oath
travis
there
rests
the
lie
that
you
uttered
just
now
stoop
and
take
it
again
he
flung
his
glove
at
travis
feet
a
great
hubbub
and
exclamation
arose
travis
lifted
the
glove
with
the
point
of
his
rapier
and
in
a
loud
voice
repeated
the
assertion
which
had
given
umbrage
to
haward
of
fair
view
that
gentleman
sprang
unsteadily
forward
and
the
blades
of
the
two
crossed
in
dead
earnest
a
moment
and
the
men
were
forced
apart
but
by
this
time
the
whole
room
was
in
commotion
the
musicians
craned
their
necks
over
the
gallery
rail
a
woman
screamed
and
half
a
dozen
gentlemen
of
years
and
authority
started
from
the
crowd
of
witnesses
to
the
affair
and
made
toward
the
centre
of
the
room
with
an
eye
to
preventing
further
trouble
where
much
wine
had
been
drunken
and
twenty
rapiers
were
out
matters
might
go
from
bad
to
worse
another
was
before
them
a
lady
in
rose
color
had
risen
from
her
chair
and
glided
across
the
polished
floor
to
the
spot
where
trouble
was
brewing
gentlemen
for
shame
she
cried
her
voice
was
in
its
clear
sweetness
final
in
its
grave
rebuke
and
its
recall
to
sense
and
decency
she
was
mistress
evelyn
byrd
who
held
sovereignty
in
virginia
and
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
command
of
her
raised
hand
the
clamor
suddenly
ceased
and
the
angry
group
parting
fell
back
as
from
the
presence
of
its
veritable
queen
evelyn
went
up
to
audrey
and
took
her
by
the
hand
i
am
not
tired
of
dancing
as
were
those
ladies
who
have
left
us
she
said
with
a
smile
and
in
a
sweet
and
friendly
voice
see
the
gentlemen
are
waiting
i
let
us
finish
out
this
measure
you
and
me
at
her
gesture
of
command
the
lines
that
had
so
summarily
broken
back
into
the
old
air
swung
the
musicians
up
went
the
swords
crossing
overhead
with
a
ringing
sound
and
beneath
the
long
arch
of
protecting
steel
moved
to
the
music
the
two
women
the
dark
beauty
and
the
fair
the
princess
and
the
herdgirl
evelyn
led
and
audrey
following
knew
that
now
indeed
she
was
walking
in
a
dream
a
very
few
moments
and
the
measure
was
finished
a
smile
a
curtsy
a
wave
of
evelyn
hand
and
the
dancers
disbanding
left
the
floor
corbin
everard
and
travis
each
had
a
word
to
say
to
haward
of
fair
view
as
they
passed
that
gentleman
haward
heard
and
answered
to
the
point
but
when
presently
evelyn
said
let
us
go
into
the
garden
and
he
found
himself
moving
with
her
and
with
audrey
through
the
buzzing
staring
crowd
toward
the
door
of
the
governor
house
he
thought
that
it
was
into
fair
view
garden
they
were
about
to
descend
and
when
they
came
out
upon
the
broad
torchlit
walk
and
he
saw
gay
parties
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
straying
here
and
there
beneath
the
trees
he
thought
it
strange
that
he
had
forgotten
that
he
had
guests
this
night
as
for
the
sound
of
the
river
below
his
terrace
he
had
never
heard
so
loud
a
murmur
it
grew
and
filled
the
night
making
thin
and
far
away
the
voices
of
his
guests
there
was
a
coach
at
the
gates
and
grymes
who
awhile
ago
had
told
him
that
he
had
a
message
to
deliver
was
at
the
coach
door
evelyn
had
her
hand
upon
his
arm
and
her
voice
was
speaking
to
him
from
as
far
away
as
across
the
river
i
am
leaving
the
ball
it
said
and
i
will
take
the
girl
in
my
coach
to
the
place
where
she
is
staying
promise
me
that
you
will
not
go
back
to
the
house
yonder
promise
me
that
you
will
go
away
with
grymes
who
is
also
weary
of
the
ball
oh
said
grymes
lightly
haward
agrees
with
me
that
best
room
cool
and
quiet
a
bottle
of
burgundy
and
a
hand
at
piquet
are
more
alluring
than
the
heat
and
babel
we
have
left
we
are
going
at
once
mistress
evelyn
haward
i
propose
that
on
our
way
to
marot
we
knock
up
contesse
and
make
him
free
of
our
company
as
he
spoke
he
handed
into
the
coach
the
lady
in
flowered
damask
who
had
held
up
her
head
but
said
no
word
and
the
lady
in
brocade
who
through
the
length
of
the
ballroom
and
the
hall
and
the
broad
walk
where
people
passed
and
repassed
had
kept
her
hand
in
audrey
and
had
talked
easily
and
with
smiles
to
the
two
attending
gentlemen
he
shut
to
the
coach
door
and
drew
back
with
a
low
bow
when
haward
deeply
flushed
handsome
face
appeared
for
a
moment
at
the
lowered
glass
art
away
to
westover
evelyn
he
asked
then
is
sweetheart
for
i
shall
not
go
to
westover
again
but
you
have
a
fair
road
to
travel
there
are
violets
by
the
wayside
for
it
is
may
day
you
know
and
the
woods
are
white
with
dogwood
and
purple
with
the
the
violets
are
for
you
but
the
great
white
blossoms
and
the
boughs
of
rosy
mist
and
all
the
trees
that
wave
in
the
wind
are
for
audrey
his
eyes
passed
the
woman
whom
he
would
have
wed
and
rested
upon
her
companion
in
the
coach
thou
fair
dryad
he
said
two
days
hence
we
will
keep
tryst
beneath
the
in
the
woods
beyond
the
glebe
house
the
man
beside
him
put
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
plucked
him
back
nor
would
look
at
evelyn
drawn
and
whitened
face
but
called
to
the
coachman
to
go
on
the
black
horses
put
themselves
into
motion
the
equipage
made
a
wide
turn
and
the
lights
of
the
palace
were
left
behind
evelyn
lodged
in
a
house
upon
the
outskirts
of
the
town
but
from
the
palace
to
mistress
stagg
was
hardly
more
than
a
stone
throw
not
until
the
coach
was
drawing
near
the
small
white
house
did
either
of
the
women
speak
then
audrey
broke
into
an
inarticulate
murmur
and
stooping
would
have
pressed
her
cheek
against
the
hand
that
had
clasped
hers
only
a
little
while
before
but
evelyn
snatched
her
hand
away
and
with
a
gesture
of
passionate
repulsion
shrank
into
her
corner
of
the
coach
oh
how
dare
you
touch
me
she
cried
how
dare
you
look
at
me
you
serpent
that
have
stung
me
so
able
to
endure
no
longer
she
suddenly
gave
way
to
angry
laughter
do
you
think
i
did
it
for
you
put
such
humiliation
upon
myself
for
you
why
you
wanton
i
care
not
if
you
stand
in
white
at
every
church
door
in
virginia
it
was
for
him
for
marmaduke
haward
of
fair
view
for
whose
name
and
fame
if
he
cares
not
for
them
himself
his
friends
have
yet
some
care
the
coach
stopped
and
the
footman
opened
the
door
descend
if
you
please
went
on
evelyn
clearly
and
coldly
you
have
had
your
triumph
i
say
not
there
is
no
excuse
for
him
you
are
very
beautiful
audrey
stood
between
the
lilac
bushes
and
watched
the
coach
turn
from
palace
into
duke
of
gloucester
street
then
went
and
knocked
at
the
green
door
it
was
opened
by
mistress
stagg
in
person
who
drew
her
into
the
parlor
where
the
woman
had
been
sitting
all
alone
and
in
increasing
alarm
as
to
what
might
be
the
outcome
of
this
whim
of
marmaduke
haward
now
she
was
full
of
inquiries
ready
to
admire
and
to
nod
approval
or
to
shake
her
head
and
cry
i
told
you
so
according
to
the
turn
of
the
girl
recital
but
audrey
had
little
to
say
little
to
tell
yes
oh
yes
it
had
been
a
very
grand
sight
yes
haward
was
kind
he
had
always
been
kind
to
her
she
had
come
home
with
mistress
evelyn
byrd
in
her
coach
might
she
go
now
to
her
room
she
would
fold
the
dress
very
carefully
mistress
stagg
let
her
go
for
indeed
there
was
no
purpose
to
be
served
in
keeping
her
seeing
that
the
girl
was
clearly
dazed
spoke
without
knowing
what
she
said
and
stood
astare
like
one
of
salmon
beautiful
was
ladies
she
would
hear
all
about
it
in
the
morning
when
the
child
had
slept
off
her
excitement
they
at
the
palace
could
have
taken
her
presence
much
amiss
or
she
would
never
in
the
world
have
come
home
in
the
westover
coach
chapter
xxi
audrey
awakes
there
had
lately
come
to
virginia
and
to
the
convention
of
its
clergy
at
williamsburgh
one
eliot
a
minister
after
the
heart
of
a
large
number
of
sober
and
godly
men
whose
reputation
as
a
body
suffered
at
the
hands
of
darden
of
fair
view
parish
bailey
of
newport
worden
of
lawn
creek
and
a
few
kindred
spirits
certainly
eliot
was
not
like
these
so
erect
indeed
did
he
hold
himself
in
the
strait
and
narrow
path
that
his
most
admiring
brethren
being
as
became
good
virginians
somewhat
in
their
saintliness
were
inclined
to
think
that
he
leaned
too
far
the
other
way
it
was
commendable
to
hate
sin
and
reprove
the
sinner
but
when
it
came
to
raining
condemnation
upon
dancing
cato
at
the
playhouse
and
like
innocent
diversions
eliot
was
surely
somewhat
out
of
bounds
the
most
part
accounted
for
his
turn
of
mind
by
the
fact
that
ere
he
came
to
virginia
he
had
been
a
sojourner
in
new
england
he
was
mighty
in
the
pulpit
was
eliot
no
droning
reader
of
last
year
sermons
but
a
thunderer
forth
of
speech
that
was
now
acrid
now
fiery
but
that
always
came
from
an
impassioned
nature
vehement
for
the
damnation
of
those
whom
god
so
strangely
spared
when
as
had
perforce
happened
during
the
past
week
he
must
sit
with
his
brethren
in
the
congregation
and
listen
to
lukewarm
nay
to
dead
and
cold
adjurations
and
expoundings
his
very
soul
itched
to
mount
the
pulpit
stairs
thrust
down
the
laodicean
that
chanced
to
occupy
it
and
himself
awaken
as
with
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
this
people
who
slept
upon
the
verge
of
a
precipice
between
hell
that
gaped
below
and
god
who
sat
on
high
serenely
regardful
of
his
creatures
plight
though
so
short
a
time
in
virginia
he
was
already
become
a
man
of
note
the
prophet
not
without
honor
whom
it
was
the
fashion
to
admire
if
not
to
follow
it
was
therefore
natural
enough
that
the
commissary
himself
a
man
of
plain
speech
from
the
pulpit
should
appoint
him
to
preach
in
bruton
church
this
sunday
morning
before
his
excellency
the
governor
the
worshipful
the
council
the
clergy
in
convention
and
as
much
of
williamsburgh
gentle
and
simple
as
could
crowd
into
the
church
eliot
took
the
compliment
as
an
answer
to
prayer
and
chose
for
his
text
daniel
fifth
and
lodging
as
he
did
on
palace
street
the
early
hours
of
the
past
night
which
he
would
have
given
to
prayer
and
meditation
had
been
profaned
by
strains
of
music
from
the
governor
house
by
laughter
and
swearing
and
much
going
to
and
fro
in
the
street
beneath
his
window
these
disturbances
filling
him
with
righteous
wrath
he
came
down
to
his
breakfast
next
morning
prepared
to
give
his
hostess
who
kept
him
company
at
table
line
and
verse
which
should
demonstrate
that
jehovah
shared
his
anger
ay
sir
she
cried
and
if
that
were
all
sir
and
straightway
she
embarked
upon
a
colored
narration
of
the
occurrence
at
the
ball
this
was
followed
by
a
wonderfully
circumstantial
account
of
marmaduke
haward
sins
of
omission
against
old
and
new
acquaintances
who
would
have
entertained
him
at
their
houses
and
been
entertained
in
turn
at
fair
view
and
by
as
detailed
a
description
of
the
toils
that
had
been
laid
for
him
by
that
audacious
piece
who
had
forced
herself
upon
the
company
last
night
eliot
listened
aghast
and
mentally
amended
his
sermon
if
he
knew
virginia
even
so
flagrant
a
case
as
this
might
never
come
before
a
vestry
should
this
woman
go
unreproved
when
in
due
time
he
was
in
the
church
and
the
congregation
was
gathering
he
beckoned
to
him
one
of
the
sidesmen
asked
a
question
and
when
it
was
answered
looked
fixedly
at
a
dark
girl
sitting
far
away
in
a
pew
beneath
the
gallery
it
was
a
fine
sunny
morning
with
a
tang
of
autumn
in
the
air
and
the
concourse
within
the
church
was
very
great
the
clergy
showed
like
a
wedge
of
black
driven
into
the
bright
colors
with
which
nave
and
transept
overflowed
his
excellency
the
governor
sat
in
state
with
the
council
on
either
hand
one
member
of
that
body
was
not
present
all
williamsburgh
knew
by
now
that
marmaduke
haward
lay
at
ordinary
ill
of
a
raging
fever
hooped
petticoat
and
fragrant
bodice
found
reason
for
whispering
to
laced
coat
and
periwig
significant
glances
traveled
from
every
quarter
of
the
building
toward
the
tall
pew
where
collected
but
somewhat
palely
smiling
sat
mistress
evelyn
byrd
beside
her
father
all
this
was
before
the
sermon
when
the
minister
of
the
day
mounted
the
pulpit
and
gaunt
against
the
great
black
gave
out
his
text
in
a
solemn
and
ringing
voice
such
was
the
genuine
power
of
the
man
that
every
face
was
turned
toward
him
and
throughout
the
building
there
fell
a
sudden
hush
audrey
looked
with
the
rest
but
she
could
not
have
said
that
she
listened
not
at
first
she
was
there
because
she
always
went
to
church
on
sunday
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
to
ask
that
she
might
stay
at
home
she
had
come
from
her
room
that
morning
with
the
same
still
face
the
same
strained
and
startled
look
about
the
eyes
that
she
had
carried
to
it
the
night
before
black
peggy
who
found
her
bed
unslept
in
thought
that
she
must
have
sat
the
night
through
beside
the
window
mistress
stagg
meeting
her
at
the
stairfoot
with
the
tidings
just
gathered
from
the
lips
of
a
of
haward
illness
thought
that
the
girl
took
the
news
very
quietly
she
made
no
exclamation
said
nothing
good
or
bad
only
drew
her
hand
across
her
brow
and
eyes
as
though
she
strove
to
thrust
away
a
veil
or
mist
that
troubled
her
this
gesture
she
repeated
now
and
again
during
the
hour
before
church
time
mistress
stagg
heard
no
more
of
the
ball
this
morning
than
she
had
heard
the
night
before
something
ailed
the
girl
she
was
not
sullen
but
she
could
not
or
would
not
talk
perhaps
despite
the
fact
of
the
westover
coach
she
had
not
been
kindly
used
at
the
palace
the
pursed
her
lips
and
confided
to
her
mirabell
that
times
were
not
what
they
once
were
had
she
not
at
bath
been
given
a
ticket
to
the
saturday
ball
by
my
lord
squander
himself
ay
and
she
had
footed
it
too
in
the
country
dance
with
the
best
of
them
with
captains
and
french
counts
and
gentlemen
and
ladies
of
title
ay
and
had
gone
down
the
middle
with
the
very
pattern
of
sir
harry
wildair
to
be
sure
no
one
had
ever
breathed
a
word
against
her
character
but
for
her
part
she
believed
no
great
harm
of
audrey
either
look
at
the
girl
eyes
now
they
were
like
a
child
or
a
saint
mirabell
nodded
and
looked
wise
but
said
nothing
when
the
church
bells
rang
audrey
was
ready
and
she
walked
to
church
with
mistress
stagg
much
as
the
night
before
she
had
walked
between
the
lilacs
to
the
green
door
when
the
westover
coach
had
passed
from
her
sight
now
she
sat
in
the
church
much
as
she
had
sat
at
the
window
the
night
through
she
did
not
know
that
people
were
staring
at
her
nor
had
she
caught
the
venomous
glance
of
mistress
deborah
already
in
the
pew
and
aware
of
more
than
had
come
to
her
friend
ears
audrey
was
not
listening
was
scarcely
thinking
her
hands
were
crossed
in
her
lap
and
now
and
then
she
raised
one
and
made
the
motion
of
pushing
aside
from
her
eyes
something
heavy
that
clung
and
blinded
what
part
of
her
spirit
that
was
not
wholly
darkened
and
folded
within
itself
was
back
in
the
mountains
of
her
childhood
with
those
of
her
own
blood
whom
she
had
loved
and
lost
what
use
to
try
to
understand
with
its
falling
skies
its
bewildered
pondering
over
the
words
that
were
said
to
her
last
night
and
the
morrow
she
must
leave
that
perhaps
when
it
should
dawn
he
would
come
to
her
and
call
her
little
maid
and
laugh
at
her
dreadful
dream
but
now
while
it
was
she
could
not
think
of
him
without
an
agony
of
pain
and
bewilderment
he
was
ill
too
and
suffering
oh
she
must
leave
the
thought
of
him
alone
back
then
to
the
long
yesterdays
she
traveled
and
played
quietly
dreamily
with
robin
on
the
green
grass
beside
the
shining
stream
or
sat
on
the
doorstep
her
head
on
molly
lap
and
watched
the
evening
star
behind
the
endless
mountains
it
was
very
quiet
in
the
church
save
for
that
one
great
voice
speaking
little
by
little
the
voice
impressed
itself
upon
her
consciousness
the
eyes
of
her
mind
were
upon
long
ranges
of
mountains
distinct
against
the
splendor
of
a
sunset
sky
last
seen
in
childhood
viewed
now
through
the
illusion
of
the
years
the
mountains
were
vastly
higher
than
nature
had
planned
them
the
streamers
of
light
shot
to
the
zenith
the
black
forests
were
still
everywhere
a
fixed
glory
a
gigantic
silence
a
holding
of
the
breath
for
things
to
happen
by
degrees
the
voice
in
her
ears
fitted
in
with
the
landscape
became
so
solemn
and
ringing
it
was
like
the
voice
of
the
archangel
of
that
sunset
land
audrey
listened
at
last
and
suddenly
the
mountains
were
gone
and
the
light
from
the
sky
and
her
people
were
dead
and
dust
away
in
that
hidden
valley
and
she
was
sitting
in
the
church
at
williamsburgh
alone
without
a
friend
what
was
the
preacher
saying
what
ball
of
the
night
before
was
he
describing
with
bitter
power
the
while
he
gave
warning
of
handwriting
upon
the
wall
such
as
had
menaced
belshazzar
feast
of
old
of
what
shameless
girl
was
he
telling
what
creature
dressed
in
silks
that
should
have
gone
in
rags
brought
to
that
ball
by
her
paramour
the
gaunt
figure
in
the
pulpit
trembled
like
a
leaf
with
the
passion
of
the
preacher
convictions
and
the
energy
of
his
utterance
on
had
gone
the
stream
of
rhetoric
the
denunciations
the
satire
the
tremendous
assertions
of
god
mind
and
purposes
the
lash
that
was
wielded
was
all
the
vices
of
the
age
irreligion
blasphemy
drunkenness
extravagance
vainglory
loose
living
fell
under
its
sting
the
condemnation
was
general
and
each
man
looked
to
see
his
neighbor
wince
the
occurrence
at
the
ball
last
night
he
was
on
that
for
final
theme
was
he
there
was
a
slight
movement
throughout
the
congregation
some
glanced
to
where
would
have
sat
marmaduke
haward
had
not
the
gentleman
been
at
present
in
his
bed
raving
now
of
a
great
run
of
luck
at
the
cocoa
tree
now
of
an
indian
who
with
his
knee
upon
his
breast
was
throttling
him
to
death
others
looked
over
their
shoulders
to
see
if
that
gypsy
yet
sat
beneath
the
gallery
colonel
byrd
took
out
his
snuffbox
and
studied
the
picture
on
the
lid
while
his
daughter
sat
like
a
carven
lady
with
a
slight
smile
upon
her
lips
on
went
the
word
picture
that
showed
how
vice
could
flaunt
it
in
so
fallen
an
age
the
preacher
spared
not
plain
words
squarely
turned
himself
toward
the
gallery
pointed
out
with
voice
and
hand
the
object
of
his
censure
and
of
god
wrath
had
the
law
pilloried
the
girl
before
them
all
it
had
been
but
little
worse
for
her
she
sat
like
a
statue
staring
with
wide
eyes
at
the
window
above
the
altar
this
then
was
what
the
words
in
the
coach
last
night
had
meant
this
was
what
the
princess
thought
this
was
what
his
world
thought
there
arose
a
commotion
in
the
ranks
of
the
clergy
of
virginia
the
reverend
gideon
darden
quitting
with
an
oath
the
company
of
his
brethren
came
down
the
aisle
and
pushing
past
his
wife
took
his
stand
in
the
pew
beside
the
orphan
who
had
lived
beneath
his
roof
whom
during
many
years
he
had
cursed
upon
occasion
and
sometimes
struck
and
whom
he
had
latterly
made
his
tool
never
mind
him
audrey
my
girl
he
said
and
put
an
unsteady
hand
upon
her
shoulder
you
a
good
child
they
can
not
harm
ye
he
turned
his
great
shambling
body
and
heavy
face
toward
the
preacher
stemmed
in
the
full
tide
of
his
eloquence
by
this
unseemly
interruption
ye
beggarly
scot
he
exclaimed
thickly
ye
saint
from
salem
way
that
know
the
very
lining
of
the
lord
mind
and
yet
walking
through
his
earth
see
but
a
poisonous
weed
in
his
every
harmless
flower
shame
on
you
to
beat
down
the
flower
that
never
did
you
harm
the
as
innocent
a
thing
as
lives
ay
i
had
my
dram
the
more
shame
to
you
that
are
justly
rebuked
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
drunken
man
i
have
done
commissary
addressing
himself
to
that
dignitary
who
had
advanced
to
the
altar
rail
with
his
arm
raised
in
a
command
for
silence
i
no
child
of
my
own
thank
god
but
the
maid
has
grown
up
in
my
house
and
i
not
sit
to
hear
her
belied
i
heard
of
last
night
was
the
mad
whim
of
a
sick
man
the
girl
as
guiltless
of
wrong
as
any
lady
here
i
gideon
darden
vouch
for
it
he
sat
heavily
down
beside
audrey
who
never
stirred
from
her
still
regard
of
that
high
window
there
was
a
moment
of
portentous
silence
then
let
us
pray
said
the
minister
from
the
pulpit
audrey
knelt
with
the
rest
but
she
did
not
pray
and
when
it
was
all
over
and
the
benediction
had
been
given
and
she
found
herself
without
the
church
she
looked
at
the
green
trees
against
the
clear
autumnal
skies
and
at
the
graves
in
the
churchyard
as
though
it
were
a
new
world
into
which
she
had
stepped
she
could
not
have
said
that
she
found
it
fair
her
place
had
been
so
near
the
door
that
all
the
congregation
was
behind
her
streaming
out
of
the
church
eager
to
reach
the
open
air
where
it
might
discuss
the
sermon
the
futile
and
scandalous
interruption
by
the
notorious
darden
and
what
marmaduke
haward
might
have
said
or
done
had
he
been
present
only
mistress
stagg
kept
beside
her
for
mistress
deborah
hung
back
unwilling
to
be
seen
in
her
company
and
darden
from
that
momentary
awakening
of
his
better
nature
had
sunk
to
himself
again
and
thought
not
how
else
he
might
aid
this
wounded
member
of
his
household
but
mary
stagg
was
a
kindly
soul
whose
heart
had
led
her
comfortably
through
life
with
very
little
appeal
to
her
head
the
two
or
three
young
women
oldfields
and
porters
of
the
virginian
stage
who
were
under
indentures
to
her
husband
and
herself
found
her
as
much
their
friend
as
mistress
their
triumphs
in
the
petty
playhouse
of
this
town
of
a
thousand
souls
were
hers
and
what
woes
they
had
came
quickly
to
her
ears
now
she
would
have
slipped
her
hand
into
audrey
and
have
given
garrulous
comfort
as
the
two
passed
alone
through
the
churchyard
gate
and
took
their
way
up
palace
street
toward
the
small
white
house
but
audrey
gave
not
her
hand
did
not
answer
made
no
moan
neither
justified
herself
nor
blamed
another
she
did
not
speak
at
all
but
after
the
first
glance
about
her
moved
like
a
sleepwalker
when
the
house
was
reached
she
went
up
to
the
bedroom
mistress
deborah
entering
stormily
ten
minutes
later
found
herself
face
to
face
with
a
strange
audrey
who
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
raised
her
hand
for
silence
in
a
gesture
so
commanding
that
the
virago
stayed
her
tirade
and
stood
i
wish
to
speak
said
the
new
audrey
i
was
waiting
for
you
there
a
question
i
wish
to
ask
and
i
ask
it
of
you
who
were
never
kind
to
me
never
kind
to
her
cried
the
minister
wife
to
the
four
walls
and
she
been
taught
and
pampered
and
treated
more
like
a
daughter
than
the
beggar
wench
she
is
and
this
is
my
return
to
sit
by
her
in
church
and
have
all
virginia
think
her
belonging
to
me
i
belong
to
no
one
said
audrey
even
god
does
not
want
me
be
quiet
until
i
have
done
she
made
again
the
gesture
of
pushing
aside
from
face
and
eyes
the
mist
that
clung
and
blinded
i
know
now
what
they
say
she
went
on
the
preacher
told
me
awhile
ago
last
night
a
lady
spoke
to
me
now
i
know
what
was
her
meaning
because
haward
who
saved
my
life
who
brought
me
from
the
mountains
who
left
me
when
he
sailed
away
where
he
thought
i
would
be
happy
was
kind
to
me
when
he
came
again
after
so
many
years
because
he
has
often
been
to
the
glebe
house
and
i
to
fair
view
because
last
night
he
would
have
me
go
with
him
to
the
ball
they
think
they
say
out
loud
for
all
the
people
to
hear
that
i
that
i
am
like
joan
who
was
whipped
last
month
at
the
court
house
but
it
is
not
of
the
lies
they
tell
that
i
wish
to
speak
her
hand
went
again
to
her
forehead
then
dropped
at
her
side
a
look
of
fear
and
of
piteous
appeal
came
into
her
face
the
witch
said
that
i
dreamed
and
that
it
was
not
well
for
dreamers
to
awaken
suddenly
the
quiet
of
her
voice
and
bearing
was
broken
with
a
cry
she
hurried
across
the
room
and
kneeling
caught
at
the
other
gown
ah
that
is
no
dream
is
it
no
dream
that
he
is
my
friend
only
my
friend
who
has
always
been
sorry
for
me
has
always
helped
me
he
is
the
noblest
gentleman
the
truest
the
best
he
loves
the
lady
at
westover
they
are
to
be
married
he
never
knew
what
people
were
saying
he
was
not
himself
when
he
spoke
to
me
so
last
night
her
eyes
appealed
to
the
face
above
her
i
could
never
have
dreamed
all
this
she
said
tell
me
that
i
was
awake
the
minister
wife
looked
down
upon
her
with
a
bitter
smile
so
had
your
fool
paradise
well
once
i
had
mine
though
was
not
your
kind
is
a
pretty
country
audrey
but
it
not
long
before
they
turn
you
out
she
laughed
somewhat
drearily
then
in
a
moment
turned
shrew
again
he
never
knew
what
people
were
saying
she
cried
you
little
fool
do
you
suppose
he
cared
was
you
that
played
your
cards
all
wrong
with
your
governor
ball
last
night
setting
up
for
a
lady
forsooth
bringing
all
the
town
about
your
ears
you
might
have
known
that
he
would
never
have
taken
you
there
in
his
senses
at
fair
view
things
went
very
well
he
was
entertained
and
i
meant
to
see
that
no
harm
came
of
it
and
darden
got
his
support
in
the
vestry
for
he
was
bit
there
no
doubt
of
that
though
what
he
ever
saw
in
you
more
than
big
eyes
and
a
brown
skin
the
lord
knows
not
i
only
your
friend
a
fine
gentleman
just
from
london
with
a
whole
canterbury
book
of
stories
about
his
life
there
to
spend
a
summer
on
the
road
between
his
plantation
and
a
wretched
glebe
house
because
he
was
only
your
friend
and
had
saved
you
from
the
indians
when
you
were
a
child
and
wished
to
be
kind
to
you
still
i
tell
you
who
did
wish
to
be
kind
to
you
and
that
was
jean
hugon
the
trader
who
wanted
to
marry
you
audrey
rose
to
her
feet
and
moved
slowly
backward
to
the
wall
mistress
deborah
went
shrilly
on
i
dare
swear
you
believe
that
haward
had
you
in
mind
all
the
years
he
was
gone
from
virginia
well
he
did
he
puts
you
with
darden
and
me
and
he
says
the
strip
of
oronoko
down
by
the
swamp
i
told
my
agent
that
you
to
have
from
it
so
many
pounds
a
year
and
he
sails
away
to
london
and
all
the
fine
things
there
and
never
thinks
of
you
more
until
he
comes
back
to
virginia
and
sees
you
last
may
day
at
jamestown
next
morning
he
comes
riding
to
the
glebe
house
so
he
says
to
darden
so
my
little
maid
that
i
brought
for
trophy
out
of
the
appalachian
mountains
is
a
woman
grown
faith
i
quite
forgot
the
child
but
saunderson
tells
me
that
you
have
not
forgot
to
draw
upon
my
oronoko
that
all
the
remembrance
you
were
held
in
audrey
she
paused
to
take
breath
and
to
look
with
shrewish
triumph
at
the
girl
who
leaned
against
the
wall
i
like
not
waking
up
said
audrey
to
herself
it
were
easier
to
die
perhaps
i
am
dying
and
then
out
he
walks
to
find
and
talk
to
you
and
in
sets
your
pretty
summer
of
all
play
and
no
work
went
on
the
other
in
a
high
voice
oh
there
was
kindness
enough
once
you
had
caught
his
fancy
i
wonder
if
the
lady
at
westover
praised
his
kindness
they
say
she
is
a
proud
young
lady
i
wonder
if
she
liked
your
being
at
the
ball
last
night
when
she
comes
to
fair
view
i
take
my
oath
that
you
walk
no
more
in
its
garden
but
perhaps
she
wo
come
now
though
her
maid
chloe
told
mistress
bray
martha
that
she
certainly
loves
him
i
wish
i
were
dead
said
audrey
i
wish
i
were
dead
like
molly
she
stood
up
straight
against
the
wall
and
pushed
her
heavy
hair
from
her
forehead
be
quiet
now
she
said
you
see
that
i
am
awake
there
is
no
need
for
further
calling
i
shall
not
dream
again
she
looked
at
the
older
woman
doubtfully
would
you
mind
she
suggested
would
you
be
so
very
kind
as
to
leave
me
alone
to
sit
here
awake
for
a
while
i
have
to
get
used
to
it
you
know
when
we
go
back
to
the
glebe
house
i
will
work
the
harder
it
must
be
easy
to
work
when
one
is
awake
dreaming
takes
so
much
time
mistress
deborah
could
hardly
have
told
why
she
did
as
she
was
asked
perhaps
the
very
strangeness
of
the
girl
made
her
uncomfortable
in
her
presence
perhaps
in
her
sour
and
withered
heart
there
was
yet
some
little
soundness
of
pity
and
comprehension
or
perhaps
it
was
only
that
she
had
said
her
say
and
was
anxious
to
get
to
her
friends
below
and
shake
from
her
soul
the
dust
of
any
possible
complicity
with
circumstance
in
moulding
the
destinies
of
darden
audrey
be
that
as
it
may
when
she
had
flung
her
hood
upon
the
bed
and
had
looked
at
herself
in
the
cracked
glass
above
the
dresser
she
went
out
of
the
room
and
closed
the
door
somewhat
softly
behind
her
chapter
xxii
by
the
riverside
yea
i
am
glad
i
and
my
father
and
mother
and
ephraim
that
thee
is
returned
to
fair
view
answered
truelove
and
has
thee
truly
no
shoes
of
plain
and
sober
stuffs
these
be
much
too
gaudy
there
a
pair
of
black
callimanco
said
the
storekeeper
reluctantly
but
these
of
flowered
silk
would
so
become
your
feet
or
this
pair
with
the
buckles
or
this
of
fine
morocco
did
you
think
of
me
every
day
that
i
spent
in
williamsburgh
i
prayed
for
thee
every
day
said
truelove
simply
for
thee
and
for
the
sick
man
who
had
called
thee
to
his
side
let
me
see
thy
callimanco
shoes
thee
knows
that
i
may
not
wear
these
others
the
storekeeper
brought
the
plainest
footgear
that
his
stock
afforded
they
are
of
a
very
small
size
perhaps
too
small
had
you
not
better
try
them
ere
you
buy
i
could
get
a
larger
pair
from
carter
store
truelove
seated
herself
upon
a
convenient
stool
and
lifted
her
gray
skirt
an
inch
above
a
slender
ankle
perchance
they
may
not
be
too
small
she
said
and
in
despite
of
her
training
and
the
whiteness
of
her
soul
two
dimples
made
their
appearance
above
the
corners
of
her
pretty
mouth
maclean
knelt
to
remove
the
worn
shoe
but
found
in
the
shoestrings
an
obstinate
knot
the
two
had
the
store
to
themselves
for
ephraim
waited
for
his
sister
at
the
landing
rocking
in
his
boat
on
the
bosom
of
the
river
watching
a
flight
of
wild
geese
drawn
like
a
snowy
streamer
across
the
dark
blue
sky
it
was
late
autumn
and
the
forest
was
dressed
in
flame
color
thy
fingers
move
so
slowly
that
i
fear
thee
is
not
well
said
truelove
kindly
they
that
have
nursed
men
with
fever
do
often
fall
ill
themselves
will
thee
not
see
a
physician
maclean
sanguine
enough
in
hue
and
no
more
gaunt
of
body
than
usual
worked
languidly
on
i
trust
no
lowland
physician
he
said
in
my
own
country
if
i
had
need
i
would
send
to
the
foot
of
for
black
murdoch
whose
fathers
have
been
physicians
to
the
macleans
of
duart
since
the
days
of
galethus
the
little
man
in
this
parish
his
father
was
a
lawyer
his
grandfather
a
merchant
he
knows
not
what
was
his
there
the
shoe
is
untied
if
i
came
every
day
to
your
father
house
and
if
your
mother
gave
me
to
drink
of
her
wine
and
if
i
might
sit
on
the
sunny
doorstep
and
watch
you
at
your
spinning
i
should
i
think
recover
he
slipped
upon
her
foot
the
shoe
of
black
cloth
truelove
regarded
it
gravely
is
not
too
small
after
all
she
said
and
does
thee
not
think
it
more
comely
than
these
other
with
their
silly
pomp
of
colored
heels
and
blossoms
woven
in
the
silk
she
indicated
with
her
glance
the
vainglorious
row
upon
the
bench
beside
her
then
looked
down
at
the
little
foot
in
its
sombre
covering
and
sighed
i
think
that
thy
foot
would
be
fair
in
the
shoe
of
donald
ross
cried
the
storekeeper
and
kissed
the
member
which
he
praised
truelove
drew
back
her
cheeks
very
pink
and
the
dimples
quite
uncertain
whether
to
go
or
stay
thee
is
idle
in
thy
behavior
she
said
severely
i
do
think
that
thee
is
of
the
generation
that
will
not
learn
i
pray
thee
to
expeditiously
put
back
my
own
shoe
and
to
give
me
in
a
parcel
the
callimanco
pair
maclean
set
himself
to
obey
though
with
the
expedition
of
a
tortoise
crisp
autumn
air
and
vivid
sunshine
pouring
in
at
window
and
door
filled
and
lit
the
store
the
doorway
framed
a
picture
of
blue
sky
water
and
ragged
landing
the
window
gave
upon
crimson
sumac
and
the
gold
of
a
sycamore
truelove
in
her
gray
gown
and
close
white
cap
sat
in
the
midst
of
the
bouquet
of
colors
afforded
by
the
motley
lining
of
the
fair
view
store
and
gazed
through
the
window
at
the
riotous
glory
of
this
world
at
last
she
looked
at
maclean
when
a
year
ago
thee
was
put
to
mind
this
store
and
i
coming
here
to
buy
made
thy
acquaintance
she
said
softly
thee
wore
always
so
stern
and
sorrowful
a
look
that
my
heart
bled
for
thee
i
knew
that
thee
was
unhappy
is
thee
unhappy
still
maclean
tied
the
shoestrings
with
elaborate
care
then
rose
from
his
knees
and
stood
looking
down
from
his
great
height
upon
the
quaker
maiden
his
face
was
softened
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
with
a
gentle
voice
no
he
said
i
am
not
unhappy
as
at
first
i
was
my
king
is
an
exile
and
my
chief
is
forfeited
i
suppose
that
my
father
is
dead
ewin
mackinnon
my
foe
upon
whom
i
swore
revenge
lived
untroubled
by
me
and
died
at
another
hands
my
country
is
closed
against
me
i
shall
never
see
it
more
i
am
named
a
rebel
and
chained
to
this
soil
this
dull
and
sluggish
land
where
from
year
end
to
year
end
the
key
keeps
the
house
and
the
furze
bush
keeps
the
cow
the
best
years
of
my
manhood
years
in
which
i
should
have
acquired
honor
have
gone
from
me
here
there
was
a
man
of
my
name
amongst
those
gentlemen
old
officers
of
dundee
who
in
france
did
not
disdain
to
serve
as
private
sentinels
that
their
maintenance
might
not
burden
a
king
as
unfortunate
as
themselves
that
maclean
fell
in
the
taking
of
an
island
in
the
rhine
which
to
this
day
is
called
the
island
of
the
scots
so
bravely
did
these
gentlemen
bear
themselves
they
made
their
lowly
station
honorable
marshals
and
princes
applauded
their
deeds
the
man
of
my
name
was
unfortunate
but
not
degraded
his
life
was
not
amiss
and
his
death
was
glorious
but
i
angus
maclean
son
and
brother
of
chieftains
i
serve
as
a
slave
giving
obedience
where
in
nature
it
is
not
due
laboring
in
an
alien
land
for
that
which
profiteth
not
looking
to
die
peacefully
in
my
bed
i
should
be
no
less
than
most
unhappy
he
sat
down
upon
the
bench
beside
truelove
and
taking
the
hem
of
her
apron
began
to
plait
it
between
his
fingers
but
he
said
but
the
sky
seems
blue
the
sunshine
bright
why
is
that
truelove
truelove
with
her
eyes
cast
down
and
a
deeper
wild
rose
in
her
cheeks
opined
that
it
was
because
friend
marmaduke
haward
was
well
of
his
fever
and
had
that
day
returned
to
fair
view
friend
lewis
contesse
did
tell
my
father
when
he
was
in
williamsburgh
that
thee
made
a
tenderer
nurse
than
any
woman
and
that
he
did
think
that
marmaduke
haward
owed
his
life
to
thee
i
am
glad
that
thee
has
made
friends
with
him
whom
men
foolishly
call
thy
master
credit
to
that
the
blue
sky
said
the
storekeeper
whimsically
there
is
yet
the
sunshine
to
be
accounted
for
this
room
did
not
look
so
bright
half
an
hour
syne
but
truelove
shook
her
head
and
would
not
reckon
further
instead
heard
ephraim
calling
and
gently
drew
her
apron
from
the
highlander
clasp
there
will
be
a
meeting
of
friends
at
our
house
next
fourth
day
she
said
in
her
most
dovelike
tones
as
she
rose
and
held
out
her
hand
for
her
new
shoes
will
thee
come
angus
thee
will
be
edified
for
friend
sarah
story
who
hath
the
gift
of
prophecy
will
be
there
and
we
do
think
to
hear
of
great
things
thee
will
come
by
kattan
that
will
i
exclaimed
the
storekeeper
with
suspicious
readiness
the
meeting
lasts
not
long
does
it
when
the
friends
are
gone
there
will
be
reward
i
mean
i
may
sit
on
the
doorstep
and
watch
you
and
watch
spin
truelove
dimpled
once
more
took
her
shoes
and
would
have
gone
her
way
sedately
and
alone
but
maclean
must
needs
keep
her
company
to
the
end
of
the
landing
and
the
waiting
ephraim
the
latter
as
he
rowed
away
from
the
fair
view
store
remarked
upon
his
sister
looks
what
makes
thy
cheeks
so
pink
truelove
and
thy
eyes
so
big
and
soft
truelove
did
not
know
thought
that
mayhap
was
the
sunshine
and
the
blowing
wind
the
sun
still
shone
but
the
wind
had
fallen
when
two
hours
later
maclean
pocketed
the
key
of
the
store
betook
himself
again
to
the
edge
and
entering
a
small
boat
first
turned
it
sunwise
for
luck
sake
then
rowed
slowly
downstream
to
the
landing
here
he
found
a
handful
of
negroes
boatmen
and
house
servants
basking
in
the
sunlight
juba
was
of
the
number
and
at
maclean
call
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
came
to
the
head
of
the
steps
no
sah
marse
duke
not
on
de
place
he
order
mirza
an
ride
off
a
pause
an
ride
off
to
de
glebe
house
yes
sah
i
done
tol
him
he
ought
to
rest
goin
to
wait
tel
he
come
back
no
answered
maclean
with
a
darkened
face
tell
him
i
will
come
to
the
great
house
in
effect
the
storekeeper
was
now
upon
fair
view
plantation
master
of
his
own
time
and
person
therefore
when
he
left
the
landing
he
did
not
row
back
to
the
store
but
it
being
pleasant
upon
the
water
kept
on
downstream
gliding
beneath
the
drooping
branches
of
red
and
russet
and
gold
when
he
came
to
the
mouth
of
the
little
creek
that
ran
past
garden
he
rested
upon
his
oars
and
with
a
frowning
face
looked
up
its
silver
reaches
the
sun
was
near
its
setting
and
a
still
and
tranquil
light
lay
upon
the
river
that
was
glassy
smooth
rowing
close
to
the
bank
the
highlander
saw
through
the
gold
fretwork
of
the
leaves
above
him
far
spaces
of
pale
blue
sky
all
was
quiet
windless
listlessly
fair
a
few
birds
were
on
the
wing
and
far
toward
the
opposite
shore
an
idle
sail
seemed
scarce
to
hold
its
way
presently
the
trees
gave
place
to
a
grassy
shore
rimmed
by
a
fiery
vine
that
strove
to
cool
its
leaves
in
the
flood
below
behind
it
was
a
little
rise
of
earth
a
green
hillock
fresh
and
vernal
in
the
midst
of
the
autumn
in
shape
it
was
like
those
hills
in
his
native
land
which
the
highlander
knew
to
be
tenanted
by
the
the
men
of
peace
there
in
glittering
chambers
beneath
the
earth
they
dwelt
a
potent
eerie
gossamer
folk
and
thence
men
and
women
they
issued
at
times
to
deal
balefully
with
the
mortal
race
a
woman
was
seated
upon
the
hillock
quiet
as
a
shadow
her
head
resting
on
her
hand
her
eyes
upon
the
river
slight
of
figure
and
utterly
mournfully
still
sitting
alone
in
the
fading
light
with
the
northern
sky
behind
her
for
the
moment
she
wore
to
the
highlander
an
aspect
not
of
earth
and
he
was
startled
then
he
saw
that
it
was
but
darden
audrey
she
watched
the
water
where
it
gleamed
far
off
and
did
not
see
him
in
his
boat
below
the
scarlet
vines
nor
when
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
fastened
the
boat
to
a
cedar
stump
and
stepped
ashore
did
she
pay
any
heed
it
was
not
until
he
spoke
to
her
standing
where
he
could
have
touched
her
with
his
outstretched
hand
that
she
moved
or
looked
his
way
how
long
since
you
left
the
glebe
house
he
demanded
abruptly
the
sun
was
high
she
answered
in
a
slow
even
voice
with
no
sign
of
surprise
at
finding
herself
no
longer
alone
i
have
been
sitting
here
for
a
long
time
i
thought
that
hugon
might
be
coming
this
afternoon
there
is
no
use
in
hiding
but
i
thought
if
i
stole
down
here
he
might
not
find
me
very
soon
her
voice
died
away
and
she
looked
again
at
the
water
the
storekeeper
sat
down
upon
the
bank
between
the
hillock
and
the
fiery
vine
and
his
keen
eyes
watched
her
closely
the
river
she
said
at
last
i
like
to
watch
it
there
was
a
time
when
i
loved
the
woods
but
now
i
see
that
they
are
ugly
now
when
i
can
steal
away
i
come
to
the
river
always
i
watch
it
and
watch
it
and
think
all
that
you
give
it
is
taken
so
surely
and
hurried
away
and
buried
out
of
sight
forever
a
little
while
ago
i
pulled
a
spray
of
farewell
summer
and
went
down
there
where
the
bank
shelves
and
gave
it
to
the
river
it
was
gone
in
a
moment
for
all
that
the
stream
seems
so
stealthy
and
slow
the
stream
comes
from
afar
said
the
highlander
in
the
west
beneath
the
sun
it
may
be
a
torrent
flashing
through
the
mountains
the
mountains
cried
audrey
ah
they
are
uglier
than
the
woods
black
and
terrible
once
i
loved
them
too
but
that
was
long
ago
she
put
her
chin
upon
her
hand
and
again
studied
the
river
long
ago
she
said
beneath
her
breath
there
was
a
silence
then
haward
is
at
fair
view
again
announced
the
storekeeper
the
girl
face
twitched
he
has
been
nigh
to
death
went
on
her
informant
there
were
days
when
i
looked
for
no
morrow
for
him
one
night
when
i
held
above
his
lips
a
mirror
and
hardly
thought
to
see
the
audrey
laughed
he
can
fool
even
death
can
he
not
the
laugh
was
light
and
mocking
a
tinkling
elvish
sound
which
the
highlander
frowned
to
hear
a
book
worn
and
lay
near
her
on
the
grass
he
took
it
up
and
turned
the
leaves
then
put
it
by
and
glanced
uneasily
at
the
slender
form
seated
upon
the
fairy
mound
that
is
strange
reading
he
said
audrey
looked
at
the
book
listlessly
the
schoolmaster
gave
it
to
me
it
tells
of
things
as
they
are
all
stripped
of
and
shows
how
men
love
only
themselves
and
how
ugly
and
mean
is
the
world
when
we
look
at
it
aright
the
schoolmaster
says
that
to
look
at
it
aright
you
must
not
dream
you
must
stay
awake
she
drew
her
hand
across
her
brow
and
eyes
you
must
stay
awake
i
had
rather
dream
said
maclean
shortly
i
have
no
love
for
your
schoolmaster
he
is
a
wise
man
she
answered
now
that
i
do
not
like
the
woods
i
listen
to
him
when
he
comes
to
the
glebe
house
if
i
remember
all
he
says
maybe
i
shall
grow
wise
also
and
the
pain
will
stop
once
more
she
dropped
her
chin
upon
her
hand
and
fell
to
brooding
her
eyes
upon
the
river
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
to
herself
sometimes
of
nights
i
hear
it
calling
me
last
night
while
i
knelt
by
my
window
it
called
so
loud
that
i
put
my
hands
over
my
ears
but
i
could
not
keep
out
the
sound
the
sound
of
the
river
that
comes
from
the
mountains
that
goes
to
the
sea
and
then
i
saw
that
there
was
a
light
in
fair
view
house
her
voice
ceased
and
the
silence
closed
in
around
them
the
sun
was
setting
and
in
the
west
were
purple
islands
merging
into
a
sea
of
gold
the
river
too
was
colored
and
every
tree
was
like
a
torch
burning
stilly
in
the
quiet
of
the
evening
for
some
time
maclean
watched
the
girl
who
now
again
seemed
unconscious
of
his
presence
but
at
last
he
got
to
his
feet
and
looked
toward
his
boat
i
must
be
going
he
said
then
as
audrey
raised
her
head
and
the
light
struck
upon
her
face
he
continued
more
kindly
than
one
would
think
so
stern
a
seeming
man
could
speak
i
am
sorry
for
you
my
maid
god
knows
that
i
should
know
how
dreadful
are
the
wounds
of
the
spirit
should
you
need
a
friend
audrey
shook
her
head
no
more
friends
she
said
and
laughed
as
she
had
laughed
before
they
belong
in
dreams
when
you
are
awake
that
is
a
different
thing
the
storekeeper
went
his
way
back
to
the
fair
view
store
rowing
slowly
with
a
grim
and
troubled
face
while
darden
audrey
sat
still
upon
the
green
hillock
and
watched
the
darkening
river
behind
her
at
no
great
distance
was
the
glebe
house
more
than
once
she
thought
she
heard
hugon
coming
through
the
bushes
and
calling
her
by
name
the
river
darkened
more
and
more
and
in
the
west
the
sea
of
gold
changed
to
plains
of
amethyst
and
opal
there
was
a
crescent
moon
and
audrey
looking
at
it
with
eyes
that
ached
for
the
tears
that
would
not
gather
knew
that
once
she
would
have
found
it
fair
hugon
was
coming
for
she
heard
the
twigs
upon
the
path
from
the
glebe
house
snap
beneath
his
tread
she
did
not
turn
or
move
she
would
see
him
soon
enough
hear
him
soon
enough
presently
his
black
eyes
would
look
into
hers
it
would
be
bird
and
snake
over
again
and
the
bird
was
tired
of
fluttering
the
bird
was
so
tired
that
when
a
hand
was
laid
on
her
shoulder
she
did
not
writhe
herself
from
under
its
touch
instead
only
shuddered
slightly
and
stared
with
wide
eyes
at
the
flowing
river
but
the
hand
was
white
with
a
gleaming
ring
upon
its
forefinger
and
it
stole
down
to
clasp
her
own
audrey
said
a
voice
that
was
not
hugon
the
girl
flung
back
her
head
saw
haward
face
bending
over
her
and
with
a
loud
cry
sprang
to
her
feet
when
he
would
have
touched
her
again
she
recoiled
putting
between
them
a
space
of
green
grass
i
have
hunted
you
for
an
hour
he
began
at
last
i
struck
this
path
audrey
audrey
hands
went
to
her
ears
step
by
step
she
moved
backward
until
she
stood
against
the
trunk
of
a
oak
when
she
saw
that
haward
followed
her
she
uttered
a
terrified
scream
at
the
sound
and
at
the
sight
of
her
face
he
stopped
short
and
his
outstretched
hand
fell
to
his
side
why
audrey
audrey
he
exclaimed
i
would
not
hurt
you
child
i
am
not
jean
hugon
the
narrow
path
down
which
he
had
come
was
visible
for
some
distance
as
it
wound
through
field
and
copse
and
upon
it
there
now
appeared
another
figure
as
yet
far
off
but
moving
rapidly
through
the
fading
light
toward
the
river
jean
jean
jean
hugon
cried
audrey
the
blood
rushed
to
haward
face
as
bad
as
that
he
said
beneath
his
breath
going
over
to
the
girl
he
took
her
by
the
hands
and
strove
to
make
her
look
at
him
but
her
face
was
like
marble
and
her
eyes
would
not
meet
his
and
in
a
moment
she
had
wrenched
herself
free
of
his
clasp
jean
hugon
help
jean
hugon
she
called
the
in
the
distance
heard
her
voice
and
began
to
run
toward
them
audrey
listen
to
me
cried
haward
how
can
i
speak
to
you
how
explain
how
entreat
when
you
are
like
this
child
child
i
am
no
monster
why
do
you
shrink
from
me
thus
look
at
me
thus
with
frightened
eyes
you
know
that
i
love
you
she
broke
from
him
with
lifted
hands
and
a
wailing
cry
let
me
go
let
me
go
i
am
running
through
the
corn
in
the
darkness
and
i
hope
to
meet
the
indians
i
am
awake
oh
god
i
am
wide
awake
with
another
cry
and
with
her
hands
shutting
out
the
sound
of
his
voice
she
turned
and
fled
toward
the
approaching
trader
haward
after
one
deep
oath
and
an
impetuous
quickly
checked
movement
to
follow
the
flying
figure
stood
beneath
the
oak
and
watched
that
meeting
hugon
in
his
coat
and
blenheim
wig
fierce
inquisitive
bragging
of
what
he
might
do
the
girl
suddenly
listless
silent
set
only
upon
an
immediate
return
through
the
fields
to
the
glebe
house
she
carried
her
point
and
the
two
went
away
without
let
or
hindrance
from
the
master
of
fair
view
who
leaned
against
the
stem
of
the
oak
and
watched
them
go
he
had
been
very
ill
and
the
hour
search
together
with
this
unwonted
beating
of
his
heart
had
made
him
desperately
weary
too
weary
to
do
aught
but
go
slowly
and
without
overmuch
of
thought
to
the
spot
where
he
had
left
his
horse
mount
it
and
ride
as
slowly
homeward
he
told
himself
he
would
manage
differently
at
least
she
should
be
made
to
hear
him
in
the
mean
time
there
was
the
night
to
be
gotten
through
maclean
he
remembered
was
coming
to
the
great
house
what
with
wine
and
cards
thought
might
for
a
time
be
pushed
out
of
doors

a
duel
juba
setting
candles
upon
a
table
in
haward
bedroom
chanced
to
spill
melted
wax
upon
his
master
hand
outstretched
on
the
board
damn
you
cried
haward
moved
by
sudden
and
uncontrollable
irritation
look
what
you
are
doing
sirrah
the
negro
gave
a
start
of
genuine
surprise
haward
could
punish
juba
had
more
than
once
felt
the
weight
of
his
master
cane
but
justice
had
always
been
meted
out
with
an
equable
voice
and
a
fine
impassivity
of
countenance
do
stand
there
staring
at
me
now
ordered
the
master
as
irritably
as
before
go
stir
the
fire
draw
the
curtains
shut
out
the
night
ha
angus
is
that
you
maclean
crossed
the
room
to
the
fire
upon
the
hearth
and
stood
with
his
eyes
upon
the
crackling
logs
you
kindle
too
soon
your
winter
fire
he
said
these
forests
flaming
red
and
yellow
should
warm
the
land
winter
is
at
hand
the
air
strikes
cold
answered
haward
and
rising
began
to
pace
the
room
while
maclean
watched
him
with
compressed
lips
and
gloomy
eyes
finally
he
came
to
a
stand
before
a
card
table
set
full
in
the
ruddy
light
of
the
fire
and
taking
up
the
cards
ran
them
slowly
through
his
fingers
when
the
lotus
was
all
plucked
and
lethe
drained
then
cards
were
born
into
the
world
he
said
sententiously
come
my
friend
let
us
forget
awhile
they
sat
down
and
haward
dealt
i
came
to
the
house
landing
before
sunset
began
the
storekeeper
slowly
i
found
you
gone
ay
said
haward
gathering
up
his
cards
is
yours
to
play
juba
told
me
that
you
had
called
for
mirza
and
had
ridden
away
to
the
glebe
house
true
answered
the
other
and
what
then
there
was
a
note
of
warning
in
his
voice
but
maclean
did
not
choose
to
heed
i
rowed
on
down
the
river
past
the
mouth
of
the
creek
he
continued
with
deliberation
there
was
a
mound
of
grass
and
a
mass
of
colored
vines
and
a
oak
finished
haward
coldly
shall
we
pay
closer
regard
to
what
we
are
doing
i
play
the
king
you
were
there
exclaimed
the
highlander
you
not
jean
hugon
searched
for
and
found
the
poor
maid
the
red
came
into
his
tanned
cheek
now
by
st
andrew
he
began
then
checked
himself
haward
tapped
with
his
finger
the
bit
of
painted
pasteboard
before
him
i
play
the
king
he
repeated
in
an
even
voice
then
struck
a
bell
and
when
juba
appeared
ordered
the
negro
to
bring
wine
and
to
stir
the
fire
the
flames
leaping
up
lent
strange
animation
to
the
face
of
the
lady
above
the
mantelshelf
and
a
pristine
brightness
to
the
swords
crossed
beneath
the
painting
the
slave
moved
about
the
room
drawing
the
curtains
more
closely
arranging
all
for
the
night
while
he
was
present
the
players
gave
their
attention
to
the
game
but
with
the
sound
of
the
closing
door
maclean
laid
down
his
cards
i
must
speak
he
said
abruptly
the
girl
face
haunts
me
you
do
wrong
it
is
not
the
act
of
a
gentleman
the
silence
that
followed
was
broken
by
haward
who
spoke
in
the
smooth
slightly
drawling
tones
which
with
him
spelled
irritation
and
sudden
hardly
controlled
anger
it
is
my
he
said
i
am
tired
and
wish
to
eat
only
of
the
lotus
will
you
take
up
your
cards
again
a
less
impetuous
man
than
maclean
noting
the
signs
of
weakness
fatigue
and
impatience
would
have
waited
and
on
the
morrow
have
been
listened
to
with
equanimity
but
the
highlander
fired
by
his
cause
thought
not
of
delay
to
forget
he
exclaimed
that
is
the
coward
part
i
would
have
you
remember
remember
yourself
who
are
by
nature
a
gentleman
and
generous
remember
how
alone
and
helpless
is
the
girl
remember
to
cease
from
this
pursuit
we
will
leave
the
cards
and
say
said
haward
with
a
strong
effort
for
with
all
my
heart
cried
the
other
hotly
when
you
have
promised
to
lay
no
further
snare
for
that
maid
at
your
gates
whose
name
you
have
blasted
whose
heart
you
have
wrung
whose
nature
you
have
darkened
and
distorted
have
you
done
demanded
haward
once
more
were
wise
to
say
at
once
not
yet
exclaimed
the
storekeeper
stretching
out
an
eager
hand
that
girl
hath
so
haunting
a
face
haward
see
her
not
again
god
wot
i
think
you
have
crushed
the
soul
within
her
and
her
name
is
bandied
from
mouth
to
mouth
were
kind
to
leave
her
to
forget
and
be
forgotten
go
to
westover
wed
the
lady
there
of
whom
you
raved
in
your
fever
you
are
her
declared
suitor
is
said
that
she
loves
you
haward
drew
his
breath
sharply
and
turned
in
his
chair
then
spent
with
fatigue
irritable
from
recent
illness
sore
with
the
memory
of
the
meeting
by
the
river
determined
upon
his
course
and
yet
deeply
perplexed
he
narrowed
his
eyes
and
began
to
give
poisoned
arrow
for
poisoned
arrow
was
it
in
the
service
of
the
pretender
that
you
became
a
squire
of
dames
he
asked
for
a
jacobite
you
are
particular
maclean
started
as
if
struck
and
drew
himself
up
have
a
care
sir
a
maclean
sits
not
to
hear
his
king
or
his
chief
defamed
in
future
pray
remember
it
for
my
part
said
the
other
i
would
have
maclean
remember
the
intonation
carried
his
meaning
maclean
flushing
deeply
rose
from
the
table
that
is
unworthy
of
you
he
said
but
since
before
servants
have
rebuked
masters
i
spare
not
to
tell
you
that
you
do
most
wrongly
is
sad
for
the
girl
she
died
not
in
that
wilderness
where
you
found
her
ads
my
life
cried
haward
leave
my
affairs
alone
both
men
were
upon
their
feet
i
took
you
for
a
gentleman
said
the
highlander
breathing
hard
i
said
to
myself
is
overseas
where
i
can
not
serve
him
i
will
take
this
other
for
my
chief
that
is
for
a
highland
cateran
and
traitor
interrupted
haward
pleased
to
find
another
dart
but
scarcely
aware
of
how
deadly
an
insult
he
was
dealing
in
a
flash
the
blow
was
struck
juba
in
the
next
room
hearing
the
noise
of
the
overturned
table
appeared
at
the
door
set
the
table
to
rights
and
light
the
candles
again
said
his
master
calmly
no
let
the
cards
lie
now
begone
to
the
quarters
was
i
that
stumbled
and
overset
the
table
following
the
slave
to
the
door
he
locked
it
upon
him
then
turned
again
to
the
room
and
to
maclean
standing
waiting
in
the
centre
of
it
under
the
circumstances
we
may
i
think
dispense
with
preliminaries
you
will
give
me
satisfaction
here
and
now
do
you
take
it
at
my
hands
asked
the
other
proudly
just
now
you
reminded
me
that
i
was
your
servant
but
find
me
a
sword
haward
went
to
a
carved
chest
drew
from
it
two
rapiers
measured
the
blades
and
laid
one
upon
the
table
maclean
took
it
up
and
slowly
passed
the
gleaming
steel
between
his
fingers
presently
he
began
to
speak
in
a
low
controlled
monotonous
voice
why
did
you
not
leave
me
as
i
was
six
months
ago
i
was
alone
quiet
dead
a
star
had
set
for
me
as
the
lights
fail
behind
ben
more
it
was
lost
and
gone
you
long
hated
long
looked
for
came
and
the
star
arose
again
you
touched
my
scars
and
suddenly
i
esteemed
them
honorable
you
called
me
friend
and
i
turned
from
my
enmity
and
clasped
your
hand
now
my
soul
goes
back
to
its
realm
of
solitude
and
hate
now
you
are
my
foe
again
he
broke
off
to
bend
the
steel
within
his
hands
almost
to
the
meeting
of
hilt
and
point
a
hated
master
he
ended
with
bitter
mirth
yet
one
that
i
must
thank
for
grace
extended
forty
stripes
is
i
believe
the
proper
penalty
haward
who
had
seated
himself
at
his
escritoire
and
was
writing
turned
his
head
for
my
reference
to
your
imprisonment
in
virginia
i
apologize
i
demand
the
reparation
due
from
one
gentleman
to
another
for
the
indignity
of
a
blow
pardon
me
for
another
moment
when
i
shall
be
at
your
service
he
threw
sand
upon
a
sheet
of
paper
folded
and
superscribed
it
then
took
from
his
breast
a
thicker
document
the

and

who
has
reason
to
oblige
me
this
letter
he
will
carry
you
down
the
coast
to
charleston
where
if
you
change
your
name
and
lurk
for
a
while
you
may
pass
for
a
buccaneer
and
be
safe
enough
for
this
other
paper
he
hesitated
then
spoke
on
with
some
constraint
it
is
your
release
from
servitude
in
virginia
in
effect
your
pardon
i
have
interest
both
here
and
at
home
it
hath
been
many
years
since
preston
the
paper
was
not
hard
to
obtain
i
had
meant
to
give
it
to
you
before
we
parted
i
regret
that
should
you
prove
the
better
swordsman
it
may
be
of
little
service
to
you
he
laid
the
papers
on
the
table
and
began
to
divest
himself
of
his
coat
waistcoat
and
long
curled
periwig
maclean
took
up
the
pardon
and
held
it
to
a
candle
it
caught
but
before
the
flame
could
reach
the
writing
haward
had
dashed
down
the
other
hand
and
beaten
out
the
blaze
angus
what
would
you
do
he
cried
and
taken
unawares
there
was
angry
concern
in
his
voice
why
man
is
liberty
i
may
not
accept
it
said
maclean
with
dry
lips
that
letter
also
is
useless
to
me
i
would
you
were
all
villain
your
scruple
is
fantastic
retorted
the
other
and
as
he
spoke
he
put
both
papers
upon
the
escritoire
weighting
them
with
the
sandbox
you
shall
take
them
hence
when
our
score
is
settled
ay
and
use
them
as
best
you
may
now
sir
are
you
ready
you
are
weak
from
illness
said
maclean
hoarsely
let
the
quarrel
rest
until
you
have
recovered
strength
haward
laughed
i
was
not
strong
yesterday
he
said
but
everard
is
pinked
in
the
side
and
travis
who
would
fight
with
pistols
hath
a
ball
through
his
shoulder
the
storekeeper
started
i
have
heard
of
those
gentlemen
you
fought
them
both
upon
the
day
when
you
left
your
sickroom
assuredly
answered
the
other
with
a
slight
lift
of
his
brows
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
move
the
table
to
one
side
so
on
guard
sir
the
man
who
had
been
ill
unto
death
and
the
man
who
for
many
years
had
worn
no
sword
acquitted
themselves
well
had
the
room
been
a
field
behind
montagu
house
had
there
been
present
seconds
a
physician
gaping
chairmen
the
interest
would
have
been
breathless
as
it
was
the
lady
upon
the
wall
smiled
on
with
her
eyes
forever
upon
the
blossoms
in
her
hand
and
the
river
without
when
it
could
be
heard
through
the
clashing
of
steel
made
but
a
listless
and
dreamy
sound
each
swordsman
knew
that
he
had
provoked
a
friend
to
whom
his
debt
was
great
but
each
according
to
his
godless
creed
must
strive
as
though
that
friend
were
his
dearest
foe
the
englishman
fought
coolly
the
gael
with
fervor
the
latter
had
an
unguarded
moment
haward
blade
leaped
to
meet
it
and
on
the
shirt
appeared
a
bright
red
stain
in
the
moment
that
he
was
touched
the
highlander
let
fall
his
sword
haward
not
understanding
lowered
his
point
and
with
a
gesture
bade
his
antagonist
recover
the
weapon
but
the
storekeeper
folded
his
arms
where
blood
has
been
drawn
there
is
satisfaction
he
said
i
have
given
it
to
you
and
now
by
the
bones
of
i
will
not
fight
you
longer
for
a
minute
or
more
haward
stood
with
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
and
his
hand
yet
closely
clasping
the
rapier
hilt
then
drawing
a
long
breath
he
took
up
the
velvet
scabbard
and
slowly
sheathed
his
blade
i
am
content
he
said
your
wound
i
hope
is
slight
maclean
thrust
a
handkerchief
into
his
bosom
to
stanch
the
bleeding
a
pin
prick
he
said
indifferently
his
late
antagonist
held
out
his
hand
it
is
well
over
come
we
are
not
young
hotheads
but
men
who
have
lived
and
suffered
and
should
know
the
vanity
and
the
pity
of
such
strife
let
us
forget
this
hour
call
each
other
friends
again
tell
me
first
demanded
maclean
his
arm
rigid
at
his
side
tell
me
first
why
you
fought
everard
and
mr
travis
gray
eyes
and
dark
blue
met
i
fought
them
said
haward
because
on
a
time
they
offered
insult
to
the
woman
whom
i
intend
to
make
my
wife
so
quiet
was
it
in
the
room
when
he
had
spoken
that
the
wash
of
the
river
the
tapping
of
walnut
branches
outside
the
window
the
dropping
of
coals
upon
the
hearth
became
loud
and
insistent
sounds
then
audrey
said
maclean
in
a
whisper
not
darden
audrey
but
mine
answered
haward
the
only
woman
i
have
ever
loved
or
shall
love
he
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
darkness
there
is
no
light
he
said
to
himself
beneath
his
breath
by
and
by
we
shall
stand
here
together
listening
to
the
river
marking
the
wind
in
the
trees
as
upon
paper
heat
of
fire
may
cause
to
appear
characters
before
invisible
so
when
he
turned
the
flame
of
a
great
passion
had
brought
all
that
was
highest
in
this
gentleman
nature
into
his
countenance
softening
and
ennobling
it
whatever
my
thoughts
before
he
said
simply
i
have
never
since
i
awoke
from
my
fever
and
remembered
that
night
at
the
palace
meant
other
than
this
coming
back
to
maclean
he
laid
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
who
made
us
knows
we
all
do
need
forgiveness
am
i
no
more
to
you
angus
than
ewin
mor
mackinnon
an
hour
later
those
who
were
to
be
lifetime
friends
went
together
down
the
echoing
stair
and
through
the
empty
house
to
the
outer
door
when
it
was
opened
they
saw
that
upon
the
stone
step
without
in
the
square
of
light
thrown
by
the
candles
behind
them
lay
an
indian
arrow
maclean
picked
it
up
was
placed
athwart
the
door
he
said
doubtingly
is
it
in
the
nature
of
a
challenge
haward
took
the
dart
and
examined
it
curiously
the
trader
grows
troublesome
he
remarked
he
must
back
to
the
woods
and
to
the
foes
of
his
own
class
as
he
spoke
he
broke
the
arrow
in
two
and
flung
the
pieces
from
him
it
was
a
night
of
many
stars
and
a
keen
wind
moved
each
in
his
degree
by
its
beauty
haward
and
maclean
stood
regarding
it
before
they
should
go
the
one
back
to
his
solitary
chamber
the
other
to
the
store
which
was
to
be
his
charge
no
longer
than
the
morrow
i
feel
the
air
that
blows
from
the
hills
said
the
highlander
it
comes
over
the
heather
it
hath
swept
the
lochs
and
i
hear
it
in
the
sound
of
torrents
he
lifted
his
face
to
the
wind
the
breath
of
freedom
i
shall
have
dreams
when
he
was
gone
haward
left
alone
looked
for
a
while
upon
the
heights
of
stars
i
too
shall
dream
he
breathed
to
himself
all
will
be
well
his
gaze
falling
from
the
splendor
of
the
skies
to
the
swaying
trees
gaunt
bare
and
murmuring
of
their
loss
to
the
hurrying
river
sadness
and
vague
fear
took
sudden
possession
of
his
soul
he
spoke
her
name
over
and
over
he
left
the
house
and
went
into
the
garden
it
was
the
garden
of
the
dying
year
and
the
change
that
in
the
morning
he
had
smiled
to
see
now
appalled
him
he
would
have
had
it
june
again
now
when
on
the
morrow
he
and
audrey
should
pass
through
the
garden
it
must
be
down
dank
and
paths
past
yellow
and
broken
stalks
with
here
and
there
wan
ghosts
of
flowers
he
came
to
the
dial
and
bending
pressed
his
lips
against
the
carven
words
that
so
often
as
they
had
stood
there
together
she
had
traced
with
her
finger
love
thou
mighty
alchemist
he
breathed
life
that
may
now
be
gold
now
iron
but
never
again
dull
lead
death
he
paused
then
there
shall
be
no
death
he
said
and
left
the
withered
garden
for
the
lonely
echoing
house
chapter
xxiv
audrey
comes
to
westover
it
was
ten
of
the
clock
upon
this
same
night
when
hugon
left
the
glebe
house
audrey
crouching
in
the
dark
beside
her
window
heard
him
bid
the
minister
as
drunk
as
himself
and
watched
him
go
unsteadily
down
the
path
that
led
to
the
road
once
he
paused
and
made
as
if
to
return
then
went
on
to
his
lair
at
the
crossroads
ordinary
again
audrey
waited
this
time
by
the
door
darden
stumbled
upstairs
to
bed
mistress
deborah
voice
was
raised
in
shrill
reproach
and
the
drunken
minister
answered
her
with
oaths
the
small
house
rang
with
their
quarrel
but
audrey
listened
with
indifference
not
trembling
and
stopping
her
ears
as
once
she
would
have
done
it
was
over
at
last
and
the
place
sunk
in
silence
but
still
the
girl
waited
and
listened
standing
close
to
the
door
at
last
as
it
was
drawing
toward
midnight
she
put
her
hand
upon
the
latch
and
raising
it
very
softly
slipped
outside
heavy
breathing
came
from
the
room
where
slept
her
guardians
it
went
evenly
on
while
she
crept
downstairs
and
unbarred
the
outer
door
sure
and
silent
and
light
of
touch
she
passed
like
a
spirit
from
the
house
that
had
given
her
shelter
nor
once
looked
back
upon
it
the
boat
hidden
in
the
reeds
was
her
destination
she
loosed
it
and
taking
the
oars
rowed
down
the
creek
when
she
came
to
the
garden
wall
she
bent
her
head
and
shut
her
eyes
but
when
she
had
left
the
creek
for
the
great
dim
river
she
looked
at
fair
view
house
as
she
rowed
past
it
on
her
way
to
the
mountains
no
light
the
hour
was
late
and
he
was
asleep
and
that
was
well
it
was
cold
upon
the
river
and
sere
leaves
loosening
their
hold
upon
that
which
had
given
them
life
drifted
down
upon
her
as
she
rowed
beneath
arching
trees
when
she
left
the
dark
bank
for
the
unshadowed
stream
the
wind
struck
her
brow
and
the
glittering
stars
perplexed
her
there
were
so
many
of
them
when
one
shot
she
knew
that
a
soul
had
left
the
earth
another
fell
and
another
it
must
be
a
good
night
for
dying
she
ceased
to
row
and
leaning
over
dipped
her
hand
and
arm
into
the
black
water
the
movement
brought
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
even
with
the
flood
say
that
one
leaned
over
a
little
farther
there
would
fall
another
star
god
gathered
the
stars
in
his
hand
but
he
would
surely
be
angry
with
one
that
came
before
it
was
called
and
the
star
would
sink
past
him
into
a
night
forever
dreadful
the
water
was
cold
and
deep
and
black
great
fish
throve
in
it
and
below
was
a
bed
of
ooze
and
mud
the
girl
awoke
from
her
dream
of
with
a
cry
of
terror
not
the
river
good
lord
not
the
river
not
death
but
life
with
a
second
shuddering
cry
she
lifted
hand
and
arm
from
the
water
and
with
frantic
haste
dried
them
upon
the
skirt
of
her
dress
there
had
been
none
to
hear
her
upon
the
midnight
river
between
the
dim
forests
that
ever
spoke
but
never
listened
she
was
utterly
alone
she
took
the
oars
again
and
went
on
her
way
up
the
river
rowing
swiftly
for
the
mountains
were
far
away
and
she
might
be
pursued
when
she
drew
near
to
jamestown
she
shot
far
out
into
the
river
because
men
might
be
astir
in
the
boats
about
the
town
landing
anchored
in
midstream
was
a
great
ship
a
bristling
with
guns
her
boat
touched
its
shadow
and
the
lookout
called
to
her
she
bent
her
head
put
forth
her
strength
and
left
the
black
hull
behind
her
there
was
another
ship
to
pass
a
slaver
that
had
come
in
the
evening
before
and
would
land
its
cargo
at
sunrise
the
stench
that
arose
from
it
was
intolerable
and
as
the
girl
passed
a
corpse
heavily
weighted
was
thrown
into
the
water
audrey
went
swiftly
by
and
the
river
lay
clean
before
her
the
stars
paled
and
the
dawn
came
but
she
could
not
see
the
shores
for
the
thick
white
mist
a
spectral
boat
with
a
sail
like
a
gray
moth
wing
slipped
past
her
the
shadow
at
the
helm
was
whistling
for
the
wind
and
the
sound
came
strange
and
shrill
through
the
filmy
ashen
morning
the
mist
began
to
lift
a
few
moments
now
and
the
river
would
lie
dazzlingly
bare
between
the
red
and
yellow
forests
she
turned
her
boat
shorewards
and
presently
forced
it
beneath
the
drooping
boughs
of
a
sycamore
here
she
left
the
boat
tying
it
to
the
tree
and
hoping
that
it
was
well
hidden
the
great
fear
at
her
heart
was
that
when
she
was
missed
hugon
would
undertake
to
follow
and
to
find
her
he
had
the
skill
to
do
so
perhaps
after
many
days
when
she
was
in
sight
of
the
mountains
she
might
turn
her
head
and
in
that
lonely
land
see
him
coming
toward
her
the
sun
was
shining
and
the
woods
were
gay
above
her
head
and
gay
beneath
her
feet
when
the
wind
blew
the
colored
leaves
went
before
it
like
flights
of
birds
she
was
hungry
and
as
she
walked
she
ate
a
piece
of
bread
taken
from
the
larder
it
was
her
plan
to
go
rapidly
through
the
settled
country
keeping
as
far
as
possible
to
the
great
spaces
of
woodland
which
the
axe
had
left
untouched
sleeping
in
such
dark
and
hidden
hollows
as
she
could
find
begging
food
only
when
she
must
and
then
from
poor
folk
who
would
not
stay
her
or
be
overcurious
about
her
business
as
she
went
on
the
houses
she
knew
would
be
farther
and
farther
apart
the
time
would
soon
arrive
when
she
might
walk
half
a
day
and
see
never
a
clearing
in
the
deep
woods
then
the
hills
would
rise
about
her
and
far
far
off
she
might
see
the
mountains
fixed
cloudlike
serene
and
still
beyond
the
miles
of
rustling
forest
there
would
be
no
more
great
houses
built
for
ladies
and
gentlemen
but
here
and
there
at
far
distances
rude
cabins
dwelt
in
by
kind
and
simple
folk
at
such
a
home
when
the
mountains
had
taken
on
a
deeper
blue
when
the
streams
were
narrow
and
the
level
land
only
a
memory
she
would
pause
would
ask
if
she
might
stay
what
work
was
wanted
she
would
do
perhaps
there
would
be
children
or
a
young
girl
like
molly
or
a
kind
woman
like
mistress
stagg
and
perhaps
after
a
long
long
while
it
would
grow
to
seem
to
her
like
that
other
cabin
these
were
her
visions
at
other
times
a
terror
took
her
by
the
shoulders
holding
her
until
her
face
whitened
and
her
eyes
grew
wide
and
dark
the
way
was
long
and
the
leaves
were
falling
fast
and
she
thought
that
it
might
be
true
that
in
this
world
into
which
she
had
awakened
there
was
for
her
no
home
the
cold
would
come
and
she
might
have
no
bread
and
for
all
her
wandering
find
none
to
take
her
in
in
those
forests
of
the
west
the
wolves
ran
in
packs
and
the
indians
burned
and
wasted
some
bitter
she
would
die
watching
the
sky
from
fair
view
windows
perhaps
he
might
idly
mark
a
falling
star
all
that
day
she
walked
keeping
as
far
as
was
possible
to
the
woods
but
forced
now
and
again
to
traverse
open
fields
and
long
stretches
of
sunny
road
if
she
saw
any
one
coming
she
hid
in
the
roadside
bushes
or
if
that
could
not
be
done
walked
steadily
onward
with
her
head
bent
and
her
heart
beating
fast
it
must
have
been
a
day
for
minding
one
own
business
for
none
stayed
or
questioned
her
her
dinner
she
begged
from
some
children
whom
she
found
in
a
wood
gathering
nuts
supper
she
had
none
when
night
fell
she
was
glad
to
lay
herself
down
upon
a
bed
of
leaves
that
she
had
raked
together
but
she
slept
little
for
the
wind
moaned
in
the
branches
and
she
could
not
cease
from
counting
the
stars
that
shot
in
the
morning
numbed
and
cold
she
went
slowly
on
until
she
came
to
a
wayside
house
quaker
folk
lived
there
and
they
asked
her
no
question
but
with
kind
words
gave
her
of
what
they
had
and
let
her
rest
and
grow
warm
in
the
sunshine
upon
their
doorstep
she
thanked
them
with
shy
grace
but
presently
when
they
were
not
looking
rose
and
went
her
way
upon
the
second
day
she
kept
to
the
road
it
was
loss
of
time
wandering
in
the
woods
skirting
thicket
and
marsh
forced
ever
and
again
to
return
to
the
beaten
track
she
thought
also
that
she
must
be
safe
so
far
was
she
now
from
fair
view
how
could
they
guess
that
she
was
gone
to
the
mountains
about
midday
two
men
on
horseback
looked
at
her
in
passing
one
spoke
to
the
other
and
turning
their
horses
they
put
after
and
overtook
her
he
who
had
spoken
touched
her
with
the
butt
of
his
whip
ecod
he
exclaimed
it
the
lass
we
saw
run
for
a
guinea
last
may
day
at
jamestown
why
so
far
from
home
light
o
heels
a
wild
leap
of
her
heart
a
singing
in
her
ears
and
audrey
clutched
at
safety
i
be
joan
the
smith
daughter
she
said
stolidly
i
niver
ran
for
a
guinea
i
niver
saw
a
guinea
i
be
going
an
errand
for
feyther
ecod
then
said
the
other
man
you
on
a
wrong
scent
was
no
dolt
that
ran
that
day
the
man
who
had
touched
her
laughed
you
are
right
tom
but
ha
sworn
was
that
brown
girl
go
your
ways
on
your
errand
for
as
he
spoke
being
of
an
amorous
turn
he
stooped
from
his
saddle
and
kissed
her
audrey
since
she
was
at
that
time
not
audrey
at
all
but
joan
the
smith
daughter
took
the
salute
as
stolidly
as
she
had
spoken
the
two
men
rode
away
and
the
second
said
to
the
first
a
williamsburgh
man
told
me
that
the
girl
who
won
the
guinea
could
speak
and
look
like
a
born
lady
did
ye
hear
the
story
of
how
she
went
to
the
governor
ball
all
tricked
out
dancing
and
making
people
think
she
was
some
fine
dame
from
maryland
maybe
and
the
next
day
she
was
scored
in
church
before
all
the
town
i
do
know
as
they
put
a
white
sheet
on
her
but
they
say
was
no
more
than
her
deserts
audrey
left
standing
in
the
sunny
road
retook
her
own
countenance
rubbed
her
cheek
where
the
man
lips
had
touched
it
and
trembled
like
a
leaf
she
was
frightened
both
at
the
encounter
and
because
she
could
make
herself
so
like
joan
joan
who
lived
near
the
crossroads
ordinary
and
who
had
been
whipped
at
the
court
house
late
that
afternoon
she
came
upon
two
or
three
rude
dwellings
clustered
about
a
mill
a
knot
of
men
the
miller
in
the
midst
stood
and
gazed
at
the
they
wore
an
angry
look
and
audrey
passed
them
hastily
by
at
the
farthest
house
she
paused
to
beg
a
piece
of
bread
but
the
woman
who
came
to
the
door
frowned
and
roughly
bade
her
begone
and
a
child
threw
a
stone
at
her
one
witch
is
enough
to
take
the
bread
out
of
poor
folks
mouths
cried
the
woman
be
off
or
i
set
the
dogs
on
ye
the
children
ran
after
her
as
she
hastened
from
the
inhospitable
neighborhood
is
a
young
witch
they
cried
going
to
help
the
old
one
swim
and
a
stone
struck
her
bruising
her
shoulder
she
began
to
run
and
fleet
of
foot
as
she
was
soon
distanced
her
tormentors
when
she
slackened
pace
it
was
sunset
and
she
was
faint
with
hunger
and
desperately
weary
from
the
road
a
bypath
led
to
a
small
clearing
in
a
wood
with
a
slender
spiral
of
smoke
showing
between
the
trees
audrey
went
that
way
and
came
upon
a
crazy
cabin
whose
door
and
window
were
fast
closed
in
the
unkempt
garden
rose
an
with
the
red
apples
shriveling
upon
its
boughs
and
from
the
broken
gate
a
line
of
cedars
black
and
ragged
ran
down
to
a
piece
of
water
here
ghastly
pale
there
streaked
like
the
sky
above
with
angry
crimson
the
place
was
very
still
and
the
air
felt
cold
when
no
answer
came
to
her
first
knocking
audrey
beat
upon
the
door
for
she
was
suddenly
afraid
of
the
road
behind
her
and
of
the
doleful
woods
and
the
coming
night
the
window
shutter
creaked
ever
so
slightly
and
some
one
looked
out
then
the
door
opened
and
a
very
old
and
wrinkled
woman
with
lines
of
cunning
about
her
mouth
laid
her
hand
upon
the
girl
arm
who
be
ye
she
whispered
did
ye
bring
warning
i
do
say
mind
ye
that
i
ca
make
a
stream
go
dry
maybe
i
can
and
maybe
i
ca
but
i
did
put
a
word
on
the
one
yonder
she
threw
up
her
arms
with
a
wailing
cry
but
they
wo
believe
what
a
poor
old
soul
says
are
they
in
an
evil
temper
honey
i
do
know
what
you
mean
said
audrey
i
have
come
a
long
way
and
i
am
hungry
and
tired
give
me
a
piece
of
bread
and
let
me
stay
with
you
the
old
woman
moved
aside
and
the
girl
entering
a
room
that
was
mean
and
poor
enough
sat
down
upon
a
stool
beside
the
fire
if
ye
came
by
the
mill
demanded
her
hostess
with
a
suspicious
eye
why
did
ye
not
stop
there
for
bite
and
sup
the
men
were
all
talking
together
answered
audrey
wearily
they
looked
so
angry
that
i
was
afraid
of
them
i
did
stop
at
one
house
but
the
woman
bade
me
begone
and
the
children
threw
stones
at
me
and
called
me
a
witch
the
crone
stooped
and
stirred
the
fire
then
from
a
cupboard
brought
forth
bread
and
a
little
red
wine
and
set
them
before
the
girl
they
called
you
a
witch
did
they
she
mumbled
as
she
went
to
and
fro
and
the
men
were
talking
and
planning
together
audrey
ate
the
bread
and
drank
the
wine
then
because
she
was
so
tired
leaned
her
head
against
the
table
and
fell
half
asleep
when
she
roused
herself
it
was
to
find
her
withered
hostess
standing
over
her
with
a
sly
and
toothless
smile
i
been
thinking
she
whispered
that
since
you
here
to
mind
the
house
i
just
step
out
to
a
neighbor
about
some
business
i
have
in
hand
you
can
stay
by
the
fire
honey
and
be
warm
and
comfortable
maybe
i
not
come
back
going
to
the
window
she
dropped
a
heavy
bar
across
the
shutter
put
the
chain
across
the
door
when
i
out
she
commanded
there
be
folk
may
want
to
win
in
coming
back
to
the
girl
she
laid
a
skinny
hand
upon
her
arm
whether
with
palsy
or
with
fright
the
hand
shook
like
a
leaf
but
audrey
half
asleep
again
noticed
little
beyond
the
fact
that
the
fire
warmed
her
and
that
here
at
last
was
rest
if
there
should
come
a
knocking
and
a
calling
honey
whispered
the
witch
do
ye
answer
to
it
or
unbar
the
door
ye
save
time
for
me
that
way
but
if
they
win
in
tell
them
i
went
to
the
northward
audrey
looked
at
her
with
glazed
uncomprehending
eyes
while
the
figure
appeared
to
grow
smaller
to
melt
out
of
the
doorway
it
was
a
minute
or
more
before
the
wayfarer
thus
left
alone
in
the
hut
could
remember
that
she
had
been
told
to
bar
the
door
then
her
instinct
of
obedience
sent
her
to
the
threshold
dusk
was
falling
and
the
waters
of
the
pool
lay
pale
and
still
beyond
the
ebony
cedars
through
the
twilit
landscape
moved
the
crone
who
had
housed
her
for
the
night
but
she
went
not
to
the
north
but
southwards
toward
the
river
presently
the
dusk
swallowed
her
up
and
audrey
was
left
with
the
ragged
garden
and
the
broken
fence
and
the
tiny
firelit
hut
reentering
the
room
she
fastened
the
door
as
she
had
been
told
to
do
and
then
went
back
to
the
hearth
the
fire
blazed
and
the
shadows
danced
it
was
far
better
than
last
night
out
in
the
cold
lying
upon
dead
leaves
watching
the
falling
stars
here
it
was
warm
warm
as
june
in
a
walled
garden
the
fire
was
red
like
the
roses
the
roses
that
had
thorns
to
bring
heart
blood
audrey
fell
fast
asleep
and
while
she
was
asleep
and
the
night
was
yet
young
the
miller
whose
mill
stream
had
run
dry
the
keeper
of
a
tippling
house
whose
custom
had
dwindled
the
ferryman
whose
child
had
peaked
and
pined
and
died
came
with
a
score
of
men
to
reckon
with
the
witch
who
had
done
the
mischief
finding
door
and
window
fast
shut
they
knocked
softly
at
first
then
loudly
and
with
threats
one
watched
the
chimney
to
see
that
the
witch
did
not
ride
forth
that
way
and
the
father
of
the
child
wished
to
gather
brush
pile
it
against
the
entrance
and
set
all
afire
the
miller
who
was
a
man
of
strength
ended
the
matter
by
breaking
in
the
door
they
knew
that
the
witch
was
there
because
they
had
heard
her
moving
about
and
when
the
door
gave
a
cry
of
affright
when
however
they
had
laid
hands
upon
her
and
dragged
her
out
under
the
stars
into
the
light
of
the
torches
they
carried
they
found
that
the
witch
who
as
was
well
known
could
slip
her
shape
as
a
snake
slips
its
skin
was
no
longer
old
and
bowed
but
straight
and
young
let
me
go
cried
audrey
how
dare
you
hold
me
i
never
harmed
one
of
you
i
am
a
poor
girl
come
from
a
long
way
off
ay
a
long
way
exclaimed
the
ferryman
more
leagues
i
warrant
than
there
are
miles
in
virginia
we
see
if
ye
can
swim
home
ye
witch
i
no
witch
cried
the
girl
again
i
never
harmed
you
let
me
go
one
of
the
torchbearers
gave
ground
a
little
she
do
look
mortal
young
but
where
be
the
witch
then
audrey
strove
to
shake
herself
free
the
old
woman
left
me
alone
in
the
house
she
went
to
to
the
northward
she
lies
cried
the
ferryman
addressing
himself
to
the
angry
throng
the
torches
flaming
in
the
night
wind
gave
forth
a
streaming
uncertain
and
bewildering
light
to
the
excited
imaginations
of
the
rustic
avengers
the
form
in
the
midst
of
them
was
not
always
that
of
a
young
girl
but
now
and
again
wavered
toward
the
semblance
of
the
hag
who
had
wrought
them
evil
before
the
child
died
he
talked
forever
of
somebody
young
and
fair
that
came
and
stood
by
him
when
he
slept
we
thought
was
his
dead
mother
but
now
now
i
see
who
was
seizing
the
girl
by
the
wrists
he
burst
with
her
through
the
crowd
let
the
water
touch
her
she
turn
witch
again
the
excited
throng
blinded
by
its
own
imagination
took
up
the
cry
the
girl
voice
was
drowned
she
set
her
lips
and
strove
dumbly
with
her
captors
but
they
swept
her
through
the
garden
and
broken
gate
past
the
cedars
that
were
so
ragged
and
black
down
to
the
cold
and
deep
water
she
thought
of
the
night
upon
the
river
and
of
the
falling
stars
and
with
a
sudden
piercing
cry
struggled
fiercely
to
escape
the
bank
was
steep
hands
pushed
her
forward
she
felt
the
ghastly
embrace
of
the
water
and
saw
ere
the
flood
closed
over
her
upturned
face
the
cold
and
quiet
stars
so
loud
was
the
ringing
in
her
ears
that
she
heard
no
access
of
voices
upon
the
bank
and
knew
not
that
a
fresh
commotion
had
arisen
she
was
sinking
for
the
third
time
and
her
mind
had
begun
to
wander
in
the
fair
view
garden
when
an
arm
caught
and
held
her
up
she
was
borne
to
the
shore
there
were
men
on
horseback
some
one
with
a
clear
authoritative
voice
was
now
berating
now
arguing
with
her
late
judges
the
man
who
had
sprung
to
save
her
held
her
up
to
arms
that
reached
down
from
the
bank
above
another
moment
and
she
felt
the
earth
again
beneath
her
feet
but
could
only
think
that
with
half
the
dying
past
these
strangers
had
been
cruel
to
bring
her
back
her
rescuer
shook
himself
like
a
great
dog
i
saved
the
witch
alive
he
panted
may
god
forgive
and
your
honor
reward
me
nay
worthy
constable
you
must
look
to
sathanas
for
reward
cried
the
gentleman
who
had
been
haranguing
the
miller
and
his
company
these
gentry
hardly
convinced
but
not
prepared
to
debate
the
matter
with
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
a
great
man
of
those
parts
began
to
slip
away
the
torchbearers
probably
averse
to
holding
a
light
to
their
own
countenances
had
flung
the
torches
into
the
water
and
now
heavily
shadowed
by
the
cedars
the
place
was
in
deep
darkness
presently
there
were
left
to
berate
only
the
miller
and
the
ferryman
and
at
last
these
also
went
sullenly
away
without
having
troubled
to
mention
the
late
transformation
from
age
to
youth
where
is
the
rescued
fair
one
continued
the
gentleman
who
for
his
own
pleasure
had
led
the
conservers
of
law
and
order
produce
the
sibyl
honest
dogberry
faith
if
the
lady
be
not
an
ingrate
you
henceforth
a
friend
at
court
my
name
is
saunders
dick
saunders
your
honor
quoth
the
constable
for
the
witch
she
lies
quiet
on
the
ground
beneath
the
cedar
yonder
she
wo
speak
cried
another
she
just
lies
there
trembling
with
her
face
in
her
hands
but
she
said
christ
when
we
took
her
from
the
water
put
in
a
third
she
was
nigh
drowned
ended
the
constable
and
i
myself
the
water
was
that
cold
wauns
i
wish
i
were
in
the
chimney
corner
at
the
court
house
ordinary
the
master
of
westover
flung
his
riding
cloak
to
one
of
the
men
wrap
it
around
the
shivering
iniquity
on
the
ground
yonder
and
you
tom
hope
that
brought
warning
of
what
your
neighbors
would
do
mount
and
take
the
witch
behind
you
master
constable
you
will
lodge
hecate
in
the
gaol
and
in
the
morning
bring
her
up
to
the
great
house
we
would
inquire
why
a
lady
so
accomplished
that
she
can
dry
a
mill
stream
to
plague
a
miller
can
not
drain
a
pool
to
save
herself
from
drowning
at
a
crossing
of
the
ways
shortly
before
court
house
gaol
and
ordinary
were
reached
the
adventurous
colonel
gave
a
to
the
constable
and
his
company
and
with
a
negro
servant
at
his
heels
rode
gayly
on
beneath
the
stars
to
his
house
at
westover
hardy
alert
in
love
with
living
he
was
well
amused
by
the
night
proceedings
the
incident
should
figure
in
his
next
letter
to
orrery
or
to
his
cousin
taylor
it
figured
largely
in
the
next
morning
when
the
sprightly
gentleman
sat
at
breakfast
with
his
daughter
and
his
second
wife
a
fair
and
youthful
kinswoman
of
martha
and
teresa
blount
the
gentleman
launched
upon
the
subject
of
witchcraft
handled
it
with
equal
wit
and
learning
the
ladies
thought
that
the
water
must
have
been
very
cold
and
trusted
that
the
old
dame
was
properly
grateful
and
would
after
such
a
lesson
leave
her
evil
practices
as
they
were
rising
from
table
word
was
brought
to
the
master
that
constable
and

she
thought
that
life
had
used
her

unkindly
a
great
tree
growing
close
to
the

sent
leaves
of
dull
gold
adrift
and
they
lay
at

and
upon

spoke

rose
and
turned
her
face
not
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
and
arbiter
of
the
fate
of
witches
but
to
evelyn
standing
above
her
evelyn
slighter
paler
than
she
had
been
at
williamsburgh
but
beautiful
in
her
colored
fragrant
silks
and
the
air
that
was
hers
of
sweet
and
mournful
distinction
now
she
cried
out
sharply
while
that
girl
again
swore
the
colonel
beneath
his
breath
audrey
did
as
she
had
been
told
and
made
her
curtsy
then
while
father
and
daughter
stared
at
her
the
gentleman
very
red
and
biting
his
lip
the
lady
marble
in
her
loveliness
she
tried
to
speak
to
ask
them
to
let
her
go
but
found
no
words
the
face
of
evelyn
at
whom
alone
she
looked
wavered
into
distance
gazing
at
her
coldly
and
mournfully
from
miles
away
she
made
a
faint
gesture
of
weariness
and
despair
then
sank
down
at
evelyn
feet
and
lay
there
in
a
swoon
chapter
xxv
two
women
evelyn
hearing
footsteps
across
the
floor
of
the
attic
room
above
her
own
bedchamber
arose
and
set
wide
the
door
then
went
back
to
her
chair
by
the
window
that
looked
out
upon
green
grass
and
trees
and
long
reaches
of
the
shining
river
come
here
if
you
please
she
called
to
audrey
as
the
latter
slowly
descended
the
stair
from
the
room
where
half
asleep
half
awake
she
had
lain
since
morning
audrey
entered
the
pleasant
chamber
furnished
with
what
luxury
the
age
afforded
and
stood
before
the
sometime
princess
of
her
dreams
will
you
not
sit
down
asked
evelyn
in
a
low
voice
and
pointed
to
a
chair
i
had
rather
stand
answered
audrey
why
did
you
call
me
i
was
on
my
way
the
other
clear
eyes
dwelt
upon
her
whither
were
you
going
out
of
your
house
said
audrey
simply
and
out
of
your
life
evelyn
folded
her
hands
in
her
silken
lap
and
looked
out
upon
river
and
sky
and
ceaseless
drift
of
colored
leaves
you
can
never
go
out
of
my
life
she
said
why
the
power
to
vex
and
ruin
was
given
you
i
do
not
know
but
you
have
used
it
why
did
you
run
away
from
fair
view
that
i
might
never
see
haward
again
answered
audrey
she
held
her
head
up
but
she
felt
the
stab
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
hers
was
the
power
to
vex
and
ruin
apparently
that
belonged
elsewhere
evelyn
turned
from
the
window
and
the
two
women
the
princess
and
the
herdgirl
regarded
each
other
oh
my
god
cried
evelyn
i
did
not
know
that
you
loved
him
so
but
audrey
shook
her
head
and
spoke
with
calmness
once
i
loved
and
knew
it
not
and
once
i
loved
and
knew
it
it
was
all
in
a
dream
and
now
i
have
waked
up
she
passed
her
hand
across
her
brow
and
eyes
and
pushed
back
her
heavy
hair
it
was
a
gesture
that
was
common
to
her
to
evelyn
it
brought
a
sudden
stinging
memory
of
the
ballroom
at
the
palace
of
how
this
girl
had
looked
in
her
splendid
dress
with
the
roses
in
her
hair
of
haward
words
at
the
coach
door
she
had
not
seen
him
since
that
night
i
am
going
a
long
way
continued
audrey
it
will
be
as
though
i
died
i
never
meant
to
harm
you
the
other
gazed
at
her
with
wide
dry
eyes
and
with
an
unwonted
color
in
her
cheeks
she
is
beautiful
thought
audrey
then
wondered
how
long
she
must
stay
in
this
room
and
this
house
without
the
window
the
trees
beckoned
the
light
was
fair
upon
the
river
in
the
south
hung
a
cloud
and
shaped
like
two
mighty
wings
audrey
with
her
eyes
upon
the
cloud
thought
if
the
wings
were
mine
i
would
reach
the
mountains
do
you
remember
last
may
day
asked
evelyn
in
a
voice
scarcely
above
a
whisper
he
and
i
sitting
side
by
side
watched
your
running
and
i
praised
you
to
him
then
we
went
away
and
while
we
gathered
flowers
on
the
road
to
williamsburgh
he
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
i
said
no
for
he
loved
me
not
as
i
wished
to
be
loved
afterward
in
williamsburgh
he
spoke
again
i
said
you
come
to
westover
and
he
kissed
my
hand
and
vowed
that
the
next
week
should
find
him
here
she
turned
once
more
to
the
window
and
with
her
chin
in
her
hand
looked
out
upon
the
beauty
of
the
autumn
day
by
day
and
day
by
day
she
said
in
the
same
hushed
voice
i
sat
at
this
window
and
watched
for
him
to
come
the
weeks
went
by
and
he
came
not
i
began
to
hear
talk
of
you
oh
i
deny
not
that
it
was
bitter
oh
me
oh
me
cried
audrey
i
was
so
happy
and
i
thought
no
harm
he
came
at
last
continued
evelyn
for
a
month
he
stayed
here
paying
me
court
i
was
too
proud
to
speak
of
what
i
had
heard
after
a
while
i
thought
it
must
have
been
an
idle
rumor
her
voice
changed
and
with
a
sudden
gesture
of
passion
and
despair
she
lifted
her
arms
above
her
head
then
clasped
and
wrung
her
hands
oh
for
a
month
he
forgot
you
in
all
the
years
to
come
i
shall
have
that
comfort
for
one
little
month
in
the
company
of
the
woman
whom
because
she
was
of
his
own
rank
because
she
had
wealth
because
others
found
her
fair
and
honored
her
with
heart
as
well
as
lip
he
wished
to
make
his
wife
for
that
short
month
he
forgot
you
the
days
were
sweet
to
me
sweet
sweet
oh
i
dreamed
my
dreams
and
then
we
were
called
to
williamsburgh
to
greet
the
new
governor
and
he
went
with
us
and
again
i
heard
your
name
coupled
with
his
there
was
between
us
no
betrothal
i
had
delayed
to
say
yes
to
his
asking
for
i
wished
to
make
sure
to
make
sure
that
he
loved
me
no
man
can
say
he
broke
troth
with
me
for
that
my
pride
gives
thanks
what
must
i
do
said
audrey
to
herself
pain
is
hard
to
bear
that
night
at
the
ball
continued
evelyn
when
coming
down
the
stair
i
saw
you
standing
beside
him
and
after
that
the
music
and
the
lights
and
you
dancing
with
him
in
your
dark
beauty
with
the
flowers
in
your
hair
and
after
that
you
and
i
in
my
coach
and
his
face
at
the
window
oh
i
can
tell
you
what
he
said
he
said
sweetheart
the
violets
are
for
you
but
the
great
white
blossoms
and
the
boughs
of
rosy
mist
and
all
the
trees
that
wave
in
the
wind
are
for
audrey
for
me
cried
audrey
for
me
an
hour
in
bruton
church
next
morning
a
silence
followed
her
words
evelyn
sitting
in
the
great
chair
rested
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
and
gazed
steadfastly
at
her
guest
of
a
day
the
sunshine
had
stolen
from
the
room
but
dwelt
upon
and
caressed
the
world
without
the
window
faint
tinkling
notes
of
a
harpsichord
floated
up
from
the
parlor
below
followed
by
young
madam
byrd
voice
singing
to
the
perturbed
colonel
love
they
wrong
thee
much
that
say
thy
sweet
is
bitter
when
thy
rich
fruit
is
such
as
nothing
can
be
sweeter
fair
house
of
joy
and
bliss
the
song
came
to
an
end
but
after
a
pause
the
harpsichord
sounded
again
and
the
singer
voice
rang
out
the
greenwood
tree
who
loves
to
lie
with
me
audrey
gave
an
involuntary
cry
then
with
her
lip
between
her
teeth
strove
for
courage
failed
and
with
another
strangled
cry
sank
upon
her
knees
before
a
chair
and
buried
her
face
in
its
cushions
when
a
little
time
had
passed
evelyn
arose
and
went
to
her
fate
has
played
with
us
both
she
said
in
a
voice
that
strove
for
calmness
if
there
was
great
bitterness
in
my
heart
toward
you
then
i
hope
it
is
not
so
now
if
on
that
night
i
spoke
harshly
unkindly
ungenerously
i
i
am
sorry
i
thought
what
others
thought
i
i
cared
not
to
touch
you
but
now
i
am
told
that
was
not
you
that
did
unworthily
haward
has
written
to
me
days
ago
i
had
this
letter
it
was
in
her
hand
and
she
held
it
out
to
the
kneeling
girl
yes
yes
you
must
read
it
concerns
you
her
voice
low
and
broken
was
yet
imperious
audrey
raised
her
head
took
and
read
the
letter
there
were
but
a
few
unsteady
lines
written
from
marot
ordinary
at
williamsburgh
the
writer
was
too
weak
as
yet
for
many
words
few
words
were
best
perhaps
his
was
all
the
blame
for
the
occurrence
at
the
palace
for
all
besides
that
which
upon
his
recovery
he
must
strive
to
teach
his
acquaintance
at
large
he
prayed
evelyn
to
believe
at
once
and
forever
she
whom
against
her
will
and
in
the
madness
of
his
fever
he
had
taken
to
the
governor
house
was
most
innocent
guiltless
of
all
save
a
childlike
affection
for
the
writer
a
misplaced
confidence
born
of
old
days
and
now
shattered
by
his
own
hand
before
that
night
she
had
never
guessed
his
passion
never
known
the
use
that
had
been
made
of
her
name
this
upon
the
honor
of
a
gentleman
for
the
rest
as
soon
as
his
strength
was
regained
he
purposed
traveling
to
westover
there
if
mistress
evelyn
byrd
would
receive
him
for
an
hour
he
might
in
some
measure
explain
excuse
for
much
he
knew
there
was
no
excuse
only
pardon
to
be
asked
the
letter
ended
abruptly
as
though
the
writer
strength
were
exhausted
audrey
read
it
through
then
with
indifference
gave
it
back
to
evelyn
it
is
true
what
he
says
whispered
the
latter
crumpling
the
paper
in
her
hand
audrey
gazed
up
at
her
with
wide
tearless
eyes
yes
it
is
true
there
was
no
need
for
you
to
use
those
words
to
me
in
the
coach
that
night
though
even
then
i
did
not
understand
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
fear
to
touch
me
her
head
sank
upon
her
arm
in
the
parlor
below
the
singing
came
to
an
end
but
the
harpsichord
lightly
fingered
gave
forth
a
haunting
melody
it
was
suited
to
the
afternoon
to
the
golden
light
the
drifting
leaves
the
murmurs
of
wind
and
wave
without
the
window
to
the
shadows
the
stillness
and
the
sorrow
within
the
room
evelyn
turning
slowly
toward
the
kneeling
figure
of
a
sudden
saw
it
through
a
mist
of
tears
her
clasped
hands
parted
she
bent
and
touched
the
bowed
head
audrey
looked
up
and
her
dark
eyes
made
appeal
evelyn
stooped
lower
yet
her
tears
fell
upon
audrey
brow
a
moment
and
the
two
cast
by
life
in
the
selfsame
tragedy
were
in
each
other
arms
you
know
that
i
came
from
the
mountains
whispered
audrey
i
am
going
back
you
must
tell
no
one
in
a
little
while
i
shall
be
forgotten
to
the
mountains
cried
evelyn
no
one
lives
there
you
would
die
of
cold
and
hunger
no
no
we
are
alike
unhappy
you
shall
stay
with
me
here
at
westover
illustration
her
dark
eyes
made
appeal
she
rose
from
her
knees
and
audrey
rose
with
her
they
no
longer
clasped
each
other
that
impulse
was
past
but
their
eyes
met
in
sorrowful
amity
audrey
shook
her
head
that
may
not
be
she
said
simply
i
must
go
away
that
we
may
not
both
be
unhappy
she
lifted
her
face
to
the
cloud
in
the
south
i
almost
died
last
night
when
you
drown
there
is
at
first
fear
and
struggling
but
at
last
it
is
like
dreaming
and
there
is
a
lightness
when
that
came
i
thought
is
the
air
of
the
mountains
i
am
drawing
near
them
will
you
let
me
go
now
i
will
slip
from
the
house
through
the
fields
into
the
woods
and
none
will
know
but
evelyn
caught
her
by
the
wrist
you
are
beside
yourself
i
would
rouse
the
plantation
in
an
hour
you
would
be
found
stay
with
me
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
colonel
secretary
a
pale
and
grave
young
man
bowing
on
the
threshold
he
was
just
come
from
the
attic
room
where
he
had
failed
to
find
the
young
woman
who
had
been
lodged
there
that
morning
the
colonel
supposing
that
by
now
she
was
recovered
from
her
swoon
and
her
fright
of
the
night
before
and
having
certain
questions
to
put
to
her
desired
her
to
descend
to
the
parlor
hearing
voices
in
mistress
evelyn
room
very
well
drew
said
the
lady
you
need
not
wait
i
will
myself
seek
my
father
with
with
our
guest
in
the
parlor
madam
byrd
was
yet
at
the
harpsichord
but
ceased
to
touch
the
keys
when
her
followed
by
darden
audrey
entered
the
room
the
master
of
westover
seated
beside
his
young
wife
looked
quickly
up
arched
his
brows
and
turned
somewhat
red
as
his
daughter
with
her
gliding
step
crossed
the
room
to
greet
him
audrey
obeying
a
motion
of
her
companion
hand
waited
beside
a
window
in
the
shadow
of
its
heavy
curtains
evelyn
quoth
the
colonel
rising
from
his
chair
and
taking
his
daughter
hand
this
is
scarce
befitting
evelyn
stayed
his
further
speech
by
an
appealing
gesture
let
me
speak
with
you
sir
no
no
madam
do
not
go
there
is
naught
the
world
might
not
hear
audrey
waited
in
the
shadow
by
the
window
and
her
mind
was
busy
for
she
had
her
plans
to
lay
sometimes
evelyn
low
voice
sometimes
the
colonel
deeper
tones
pierced
her
understanding
when
this
was
so
she
moved
restlessly
wishing
that
it
were
night
and
she
away
presently
she
began
to
observe
the
room
which
was
richly
furnished
there
were
garlands
upon
the
ceiling
a
table
near
her
was
set
with
many
curious
ornaments
upon
a
tall
cabinet
stood
a
bowl
of
yellow
flowers
the
lady
at
the
harpsichord
wore
a
dress
to
match
the
flowers
while
evelyn
dress
was
white
beyond
them
was
a
pier
glass
finer
than
the
one
at
fair
view
this
glass
reflected
the
doorway
and
thus
she
was
the
first
to
see
the
man
from
whom
she
had
fled
marmaduke
haward
massa
announced
the
servant
who
had
ushered
him
through
the
hall
haward
hat
in
hand
entered
the
room
the
three
beside
the
harpsichord
arose
the
one
at
the
window
slipped
deeper
into
the
shadow
of
the
curtains
and
so
escaped
the
visitor
observation
the
latter
bowed
to
the
master
of
westover
who
ceremoniously
returned
the
salute
and
to
the
two
ladies
who
curtsied
to
him
but
opened
not
their
lips
this
sir
said
colonel
byrd
holding
himself
very
erect
is
an
unexpected
honor
rather
sir
an
intrusion
answered
the
other
i
beg
you
to
believe
that
i
will
trouble
you
for
no
longer
time
than
matters
require
the
colonel
bit
his
lip
there
was
a
time
when
haward
was
most
welcome
to
my
house
if
is
no
longer
thus
haward
made
a
gesture
of
assent
i
know
that
the
time
is
past
i
am
sorry
that
is
so
i
had
thought
sir
to
find
you
alone
am
i
to
speak
before
these
ladies
the
colonel
hesitated
but
evelyn
leaving
madam
byrd
beside
the
harpsichord
came
to
her
father
side
that
gentleman
glanced
at
her
keenly
there
was
no
agitation
to
mar
the
pensive
loveliness
of
her
face
her
eyes
were
steadfast
the
lips
faintly
smiling
if
what
you
have
to
say
concerns
my
daughter
said
the
colonel
she
will
listen
to
you
here
and
now
for
a
few
moments
dead
silence
then
haward
spoke
slowly
weighing
his
words
i
am
on
my
way
colonel
byrd
to
the
country
beyond
the
falls
i
have
entered
upon
a
search
and
i
know
not
when
it
will
be
ended
or
when
i
shall
return
westover
lay
in
my
path
and
there
was
that
which
needed
to
be
said
to
you
sir
and
to
your
daughter
when
it
has
been
said
i
will
take
my
leave
he
paused
then
with
a
quickened
breath
again
took
up
his
task
some
months
ago
sir
i
sought
and
obtained
your
permission
to
make
my
suit
to
your
daughter
for
her
hand
the
lady
worthy
of
a
better
mate
hath
done
well
in
saying
no
to
my
importunity
i
accept
her
decision
withdraw
my
suit
wish
her
all
happiness
he
bowed
again
formally
then
stood
with
lowered
eyes
his
hand
griping
the
edge
of
the
table
i
am
aware
that
my
daughter
has
declined
to
entertain
your
proposals
said
the
colonel
coldly
and
i
approve
her
determination
is
this
all
sir
it
should
perhaps
be
all
answered
haward
and
yet
he
turned
to
evelyn
calm
with
that
faint
smile
upon
her
face
may
i
speak
to
you
he
said
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
she
looked
at
him
with
parting
lips
here
and
now
the
colonel
answered
for
her
be
brief
sir
the
master
of
fair
view
found
it
hard
to
speak
evelyn
he
began
and
paused
biting
his
lip
it
was
very
quiet
in
the
familiar
parlor
quiet
and
dim
and
drawing
toward
eventide
the
lady
at
the
harpsichord
chanced
to
let
fall
her
hand
upon
the
keys
they
gave
forth
a
deep
and
melancholy
sound
that
vibrated
through
the
room
the
chord
was
like
an
odor
in
its
subtle
power
to
bring
crowding
memories
to
haward
and
perhaps
to
evelyn
scenes
long
shifted
long
faded
took
on
fresh
colors
glowed
anew
replaced
the
canvas
of
the
present
for
years
the
two
had
been
friends
later
months
had
seen
him
her
avowed
suitor
in
this
very
room
he
had
bent
over
her
at
the
harpsichord
when
the
song
was
finished
had
sat
beside
her
in
the
deep
window
seat
while
the
stars
brightened
before
the
candles
were
brought
in
now
for
a
moment
he
stood
with
his
hand
over
his
eyes
then
letting
it
fall
he
spoke
with
firmness
evelyn
he
said
if
i
have
wronged
you
forgive
me
our
friendship
that
has
been
i
lay
at
your
feet
forget
it
and
forget
me
you
are
noble
generous
high
of
mind
i
pray
you
to
let
no
remembrance
of
me
trouble
your
life
may
it
be
happy
may
all
good
attend
you
evelyn
he
kneeled
and
lifted
to
his
lips
the
hem
of
her
dress
as
he
rose
and
bowing
low
would
have
taken
formal
leave
of
the
two
beside
her
she
put
out
her
hand
staying
him
by
the
gesture
and
the
look
upon
her
colorless
face
you
spoke
of
a
search
she
said
what
search
haward
raised
his
eyes
to
hers
that
were
quiet
almost
smiling
though
darkly
shadowed
by
past
pain
i
will
tell
you
evelyn
why
should
not
i
tell
you
this
also
four
days
ago
upon
my
return
to
fair
view
i
sought
and
found
the
woman
that
i
love
the
woman
that
by
all
that
is
best
within
me
i
love
worthily
she
shrank
from
me
she
listened
not
she
shut
eye
and
ear
and
fled
and
i
confident
fool
i
thought
i
will
make
her
heed
and
so
let
her
go
when
the
morrow
came
she
was
gone
indeed
he
halted
made
an
involuntary
gesture
of
distress
then
went
on
rapidly
and
with
agitation
there
was
a
boat
missing
she
was
seen
to
pass
jamestown
rowing
steadily
up
the
river
but
for
this
i
should
have
thought
i
should
have
feared
god
knows
what
i
should
not
have
feared
as
it
is
i
have
searchers
out
both
on
this
side
and
on
the
southern
shore
an
indian
and
myself
have
come
up
river
in
his
canoe
we
have
not
found
her
yet
if
it
be
so
that
she
has
passed
unseen
through
the
settled
country
i
will
seek
her
toward
the
mountains
and
when
you
have
found
her
what
then
sir
cried
the
colonel
tapping
his
snuffbox
then
sir
answered
haward
with
hauteur
she
will
become
my
wife
he
turned
again
to
evelyn
but
when
he
spoke
it
was
less
to
her
than
to
himself
it
grows
late
he
said
night
is
coming
on
and
at
the
fall
of
the
leaf
the
nights
are
cold
one
sleeping
in
the
forest
would
suffer
if
she
sleeps
i
have
not
slept
since
she
was
missed
i
must
begone
it
grows
late
indeed
replied
evelyn
with
lifted
face
and
a
voice
low
clear
and
sweet
as
a
silver
bell
so
late
that
there
is
a
rose
flush
in
the
sky
beyond
the
river
look
you
may
see
it
through
yonder
window
she
touched
his
hand
and
made
him
look
to
the
far
window
who
is
it
that
stands
in
the
shadow
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
he
asked
at
last
beneath
his
breath
is
audrey
answered
evelyn
in
the
same
clear
sweet
and
passionless
tones
she
took
her
hand
from
his
and
addressed
herself
to
her
father
dear
sir
she
said
to
my
mind
no
quarrel
exists
between
us
and
this
gentleman
there
is
no
reason
she
drew
herself
up
no
reason
why
we
should
not
extend
to
marmaduke
haward
the
hospitality
of
westover
she
smiled
and
leaned
against
her
father
arm
and
now
let
us
three
you
and
maria
whom
i
protest
you
keep
too
long
at
the
harpsichord
and
i
who
love
this
hour
of
the
evening
let
us
go
walk
in
the
garden
and
see
what
flowers
the
frost
has
spared
chapter
xxvi
sanctuary
child
demanded
haward
why
did
you
frighten
me
so
he
took
her
hands
from
her
face
and
drew
her
from
the
shadow
of
the
curtain
into
the
evening
glow
her
hands
lay
passive
in
his
her
eyes
held
the
despair
of
a
runner
spent
and
fallen
with
the
goal
just
in
sight
would
have
had
me
go
again
to
the
mountains
for
you
little
maid
haward
voice
trembled
with
the
delight
of
his
ended
quest
call
me
not
by
that
name
audrey
said
one
that
is
dead
used
it
i
will
call
you
love
he
answered
my
love
my
dear
love
my
true
love
nor
that
either
she
said
and
caught
her
breath
i
know
not
why
you
should
speak
to
me
so
what
must
i
call
you
then
he
asked
with
the
smile
still
upon
his
lips
a
stranger
and
a
dreamer
she
answered
go
your
ways
and
i
will
go
mine
there
was
silence
in
the
room
broken
by
haward
for
us
two
one
path
he
said
why
audrey
audrey
audrey
suddenly
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
my
love
he
whispered
my
love
audrey
my
wife
audrey
his
kisses
rained
upon
her
face
she
lay
quiet
until
the
storm
had
passed
then
freed
herself
looked
at
him
and
shook
her
head
you
killed
him
she
said
that
one
whom
i
worshiped
it
was
not
well
done
of
you
there
was
a
dream
i
had
last
summer
i
told
it
to
to
the
one
you
killed
now
part
of
the
dream
has
come
true
you
never
were
oh
death
had
been
easy
pain
for
it
had
left
memory
hope
but
you
never
were
you
never
were
i
am
cried
haward
ardently
i
am
your
lover
i
am
he
who
says
to
you
forget
the
past
forget
and
forgive
and
come
with
me
out
of
your
dreaming
come
audrey
come
come
from
the
dim
woods
into
the
sunshine
into
the
sunshine
of
the
garden
the
night
you
went
away
i
was
there
audrey
under
the
stars
the
paths
were
deep
in
leaves
the
flowers
dead
and
blackening
but
the
trees
will
be
green
again
and
the
flowers
bloom
when
we
are
wed
we
will
walk
there
bringing
the
spring
with
us
when
we
are
wed
she
answered
that
will
never
be
it
will
be
this
week
he
said
smiling
dear
dryad
who
have
no
friends
to
make
a
pother
no
dowry
to
lug
with
you
no
gay
wedding
raiment
to
provide
who
have
only
to
curtsy
farewell
to
the
trees
and
put
your
hand
in
mine
she
drew
away
her
hands
that
he
had
caught
in
his
and
pressed
them
above
her
heart
then
looked
restlessly
from
window
to
door
will
you
let
me
pass
sir
she
asked
at
last
i
am
tired
i
have
to
think
what
i
am
to
do
where
i
am
to
go
where
you
are
to
go
he
exclaimed
why
back
to
the
glebe
house
and
i
will
follow
and
the
minister
shall
marry
us
child
child
where
else
should
you
go
what
else
should
you
do
god
knows
cried
the
girl
with
sudden
and
extraordinary
passion
but
not
that
oh
he
is
gone
that
other
who
would
have
understood
haward
let
fall
his
outstretched
hand
drew
back
a
pace
or
two
and
stood
with
knitted
brows
the
room
was
very
quiet
only
audrey
breathed
hurriedly
and
through
the
open
window
came
the
sudden
lonely
cry
of
some
river
bird
the
note
was
repeated
ere
haward
spoke
again
i
will
try
to
understand
he
said
slowly
audrey
is
it
evelyn
that
comes
between
us
audrey
passed
her
hand
over
her
eyes
and
brow
and
pushed
back
her
heavy
hair
oh
i
have
wronged
her
she
cried
i
have
taken
her
portion
if
once
she
was
cruel
to
me
yet
she
kissed
me
her
tears
fell
upon
my
face
that
which
i
have
robbed
her
of
i
want
not
oh
my
heart
my
heart
is
i
not
you
who
have
wronged
this
lady
said
haward
after
a
pause
i
have
i
hope
her
forgiveness
is
this
the
fault
that
keeps
you
from
me
audrey
answered
not
but
leaned
against
the
window
and
looked
at
the
cloud
in
the
south
that
was
now
an
amethyst
island
haward
went
closer
to
her
is
it
he
said
is
it
because
in
my
mind
i
sinned
against
you
audrey
because
i
brought
upon
you
insult
and
calumny
child
child
i
am
of
the
world
that
i
did
all
this
is
true
but
now
i
would
not
purchase
endless
bliss
with
your
least
harm
and
your
name
is
more
to
me
than
my
own
forgive
me
audrey
forgive
the
past
he
bowed
his
head
as
he
stood
before
her
audrey
gazed
at
him
with
wide
dry
eyes
whose
lids
burned
a
hot
color
had
risen
to
her
cheek
at
her
heart
was
a
heavier
aching
a
fuller
knowledge
of
loss
there
is
no
past
she
said
it
was
a
dream
and
a
lie
there
is
only
you
are
a
the
purple
cloud
across
the
river
began
to
darken
there
came
again
the
lonely
cry
of
the
bird
in
the
house
quarter
the
slaves
were
singing
as
they
went
about
their
work
suddenly
audrey
laughed
it
was
sad
laughter
as
mocking
and
elfin
and
mirthless
a
sound
as
was
ever
heard
in
autumn
twilight
a
stranger
she
repeated
i
know
you
by
your
name
and
that
is
all
you
are
marmaduke
haward
of
fair
view
while
i
i
am
audrey
she
curtsied
to
him
so
changed
so
defiant
so
darkly
beautiful
that
he
caught
his
breath
to
behold
her
you
are
all
the
world
to
me
he
cried
audrey
audrey
look
at
me
listen
to
me
he
would
have
approached
her
would
have
seized
her
hand
but
she
waved
him
back
oh
the
world
we
must
think
of
that
what
would
they
say
the
governor
and
the
council
and
the
people
who
go
to
balls
and
all
the
great
folk
you
write
to
in
england
what
would
they
say
if
you
married
me
marmaduke
haward
of
fair
view
the
richest
man
in
virginia
marmaduke
haward
the
man
of
taste
the
scholar
the
fine
gentleman
proud
of
his
name
jealous
of
his
honor
and
darden
audrey
who
hath
gone
barefoot
on
errands
to
most
houses
in
fair
view
parish
darden
audrey
whom
the
preacher
pointed
out
to
the
people
in
bruton
church
they
would
call
you
mad
they
would
give
you
cap
and
bells
they
would
say
he
think
that
he
can
make
her
one
of
us
her
that
we
turned
and
looked
long
upon
in
bruton
church
when
the
preacher
called
her
by
a
right
name
child
for
god
sake
cried
haward
there
is
the
lady
too
the
lady
who
left
us
here
together
we
must
not
forget
to
think
of
her
of
her
whose
picture
you
showed
me
at
fair
view
who
was
to
be
your
wife
who
took
me
by
the
hand
that
night
at
the
palace
there
is
reproach
in
her
eyes
ah
do
you
not
think
the
look
might
grow
might
come
to
haunt
us
and
yourself
oh
sooner
or
later
regret
and
weariness
would
come
to
dwell
at
fair
view
the
lady
who
walks
in
the
garden
here
is
a
fine
lady
and
a
fit
mate
for
a
fine
gentleman
and
i
am
a
beggar
maid
and
no
man
mate
unless
it
be
hugon
hugon
who
has
sworn
to
have
me
in
the
house
he
has
built
hugon
who
would
surely
kill
you
haward
caught
her
by
the
wrists
bruising
them
in
his
grasp
audrey
audrey
let
these
fancies
be
if
we
love
each
other
if
she
echoed
and
pulled
her
hands
away
her
voice
was
strange
her
eyes
were
bright
and
strained
her
face
was
burning
but
if
not
what
then
and
how
should
i
love
you
who
are
a
stranger
to
me
oh
a
generous
stranger
who
where
he
thinks
he
has
done
a
wrong
would
repair
the
damage
her
voice
broke
she
flung
back
her
head
and
pressed
her
hands
against
her
throat
you
have
done
me
no
wrong
she
said
if
you
had
i
would
forgive
you
would
say
to
you
would
go
my
way
as
i
am
going
now
let
me
pass
sir
haward
barred
her
way
a
stranger
he
said
beneath
his
breath
is
there
then
no
tie
between
shadow
and
substance
dream
and
reality
none
answered
audrey
with
defiance
why
did
you
come
to
the
mountains
eleven
years
ago
what
business
was
it
of
yours
whether
i
lived
or
died
oh
god
was
not
kind
to
send
you
there
you
loved
me
once
he
cried
audrey
audrey
have
i
slain
your
love
it
was
never
yours
she
answered
passionately
it
was
that
other
that
other
whom
i
imagined
who
never
lived
outside
my
dream
oh
let
me
pass
let
me
begone
you
are
cruel
to
keep
me
i
i
am
so
tired
white
to
the
lips
haward
moved
backward
a
step
or
two
but
yet
stood
between
her
and
the
door
moments
passed
before
he
spoke
then
will
you
become
my
wife
he
asked
in
a
studiously
quiet

come
in
time
but
give
me
now
the
right
to
be
your
protector
the
power
to
clear
your
name
she
looked
at
him
with
a
strange
smile
a
fine
gesture
of
scorn

you
loving
you
not
that
will
i
never
do
protector
that
is
a
word
i
have
grown
to
dislike
my
name
it
is
a
slight
thing
what
matter
if
folk
look
askance
when
it
is
only
darden
audrey
and
there
are
those
whom
an
ill
fame
does
not
frighten
the
schoolmaster

still
give
me
books
to
read
and
tell
me
what
they
mean
he
will
not
care
nor
the
drunken
minister
nor
hugon

going
back
to
them
to
mistress
deborah
and
the
glebe
house
she
will
beat
me
and
the
minister
will
curse
but
they
will
take
me
in
i
will
work
very
hard
and
never
look
to
fair
view
i
see
now
that
i
could
never
reach
the
mountains
she
began
to
move
toward
the
door
he
kept
with
her
step
for
step
his
eyes
upon
her
face
you
will
come
no
more
to
the
glebe
house
she
said
if
you
do
though
the
mountains
be
far
the
river
is
near
he
put
his
hand
upon
the
latch
of
the
door
you
will
rest
here
he
asked
gently
as
of
a
child
i
will
speak
to
colonel
byrd
he
will
send
some
one
with
you
down
the
river
it
will
be
managed
for
you
and
as
you
wish
you
will
rest
you
go
from
me
now
to
your
room
audrey
yes
she
answered
and
thought
she
spoke
the
truth
i
love
you
love
you
greatly
he
continued
i
will
conquer
conquer
and
atone
but
now
poor
tired
one
i
let
you
go
sleep
audrey
sleep
and
dream
again
he
held
open
the
door
for
her
and
stood
aside
with
bent
head
she
passed
him
then
turned
and
after
a
moment
of
silence
spoke
to
him
with
a
strange
and
sorrowful
stateliness
you
think
sir
she
said
that
i
have
something
to
forgive
much
he
answered
very
much
audrey
and
you
wish
my
forgiveness
ay
audrey
your
forgiveness
and
your
love
the
first
is
mine
to
give
she
said
if
you
wish
it
take
it
i
forgive
you
sir
he
answered
audrey
she
repeated
and
slowly
mounting
the
broad
staircase
passed
from
his
sight
it
was
dark
in
the
upper
hall
but
there
was
a
great
glimmer
of
sky
an
opal
space
to
mark
a
window
that
gave
upon
the
sloping
lawn
and
pallid
river
the
pale
light
seemed
to
beckon
audrey
went
not
on
to
her
attic
room
but
to
the
window
and
in
doing
so
passed
a
small
door
as
she
went
by
she
glanced
through
the
aperture
and
saw
that
there
was
a
narrow
stairway
built
for
the
servants
use
winding
down
to
a
door
in
the
western
face
of
the
house
once
at
the
open
window
she
leaned
forth
and
looked
to
the
east
and
the
west
the
hush
of
the
evening
had
fallen
the
light
was
faint
above
the
last
rose
flush
a
great
star
palely
shone
all
was
quiet
deserted
nothing
stirring
on
the
slope
no
sound
save
the
distant
singing
of
the
slaves
the
river
lay
bare
from
shore
to
shore
save
where
the
westover
landing
stretched
raggedly
into
the
flood
to
its
piles
small
boats
were
tied
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
boatmen
wharf
and
river
appeared
as
barren
of
movement
and
life
as
did
the
long
expanse
of
dusky
lawn
i
will
not
sleep
in
this
house
said
audrey
to
herself
if
i
can
reach
those
boats
unseen
i
will
go
alone
down
the
river
that
will
be
well
i
am
not
wanted
here
when
she
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
narrow
stair
she
slipped
through
the
door
into
a
world
all
dusk
and
quiet
where
was
none
to
observe
her
none
to
stay
her
crouching
by
the
wall
she
crept
to
the
front
of
the
house
stole
around
the
stone
steps
where
that
morning
she
had
sat
in
the
sunshine
and
came
to
the
parlor
windows
close
beneath
one
was
a
block
of
stone
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
stood
upon
this
and
pressing
her
face
against
the
window
pane
looked
her
last
upon
the
room
she
had
so
lately
left
a
low
fire
upon
the
hearth
darkly
illumined
it
he
sat
by
the
table
with
his
arms
outstretched
and
his
head
bowed
upon
them
audrey
dropped
from
the
stone
into
the
ever
growing
shadows
crossed
the
lawn
slipped
below
the
bank
and
took
her
way
along
the
river
edge
to
the
long
landing
when
she
was
half
way
down
its
length
she
saw
that
there
was
a
canoe
which
she
had
not
observed
and
that
it
held
one
man
who
sat
with
his
back
to
the
shore
with
a
quick
breath
of
dismay
she
stood
still
then
setting
her
lips
went
on
for
the
more
she
thought
of
having
to
see
those
two
again
evelyn
and
the
master
of
fair
view
the
stronger
grew
her
determination
to
commence
her
backward
journey
alone
and
at
once
she
had
almost
reached
the
end
of
the
wharf
when
the
man
in
the
boat
stood
up
and
faced
her
it
was
hugon
the
dusk
was
not
so
great
but
that
the
two
the
hunter
and
his
quarry
could
see
each
other
plainly
the
latter
turned
with
the
sob
of
a
stricken
deer
but
the
impulse
to
flight
lasted
not
where
might
she
go
run
blindly
north
or
east
or
west
through
the
fields
of
westover
that
would
shortly
lead
to
cowering
in
some
wood
or
swamp
while
the
feet
of
the
searchers
came
momently
nearer
return
to
the
house
stand
at
bay
once
more
with
all
her
strength
of
soul
she
put
this
course
from
her
the
quick
strife
in
her
mind
ended
in
her
moving
slowly
as
though
drawn
by
an
invisible
hand
to
the
edge
of
the
wharf
above
hugon
and
his
canoe
she
did
not
wonder
to
see
him
there
every
word
that
haward
had
spoken
in
the
westover
parlor
was
burned
upon
her
brain
and
he
had
said
that
he
had
come
up
river
with
an
indian
this
was
the
indian
and
to
hunt
her
down
those
two
had
joined
forces
audrey
whispered
the
trader
staring
as
at
a
spirit
yes
jean
hugon
she
answered
and
looked
down
the
glimmering
reaches
of
the
james
then
at
the
slender
canoe
and
the
deep
and
dark
water
that
flowed
between
the
piles
in
the
slight
craft
with
that
strong
man
the
river
for
ally
she
were
safe
as
in
a
tower
of
brass
i
am
going
home
jean
she
said
will
you
row
me
down
the
river
and
tell
me
as
we
go
your
stories
of
the
woods
and
your
glories
in
france
if
you
speak
of
other
things
i
will
drown
myself
for
i
am
tired
of
hearing
them
in
the
morning
we
will
stop
at
some
landing
for
food
and
then
go
on
again
let
us
hasten
the
trader
moistened
his
lips
and
him
he
demanded
hoarsely
that
englishman
that
marmaduke
haward
of
fair
view
who
came
to
me
and
said
seeing
that
an
indian
and
a
bloodhound
have
gifts
in
common
we
will
take
up
the
quest
together
find
her
though
it
be
to
lose
her
to
me
that
same
hour
and
look
that
in
our
travels
you
try
no
foul
play
for
this
time
i
go
armed
what
of
him
audrey
waved
her
hand
toward
the
house
she
had
left
he
is
there
let
us
make
haste
as
she
spoke
she
descended
the
steps
and
evading
his
eager
hand
stepped
into
the
canoe
he
looked
at
her
doubtfully
half
afraid
so
strange
was
it
to
see
her
sitting
there
so
like
a
spirit
from
the
land
beyond
the
sun
a
out
of
one
of
old
pierre
wild
tales
had
she
come
upon
him
with
quickened
breath
he
loosed
the
canoe
from
its
mooring
and
took
up
the
paddle
a
moment
and
they
were
quit
of
the
westover
landing
and
embarked
upon
a
strange
journey
during
which
hour
after
hour
hugon
made
wild
love
and
hour
after
hour
audrey
opened
not
her
lips
as
the
canoe
went
swiftly
down
the
flood
lights
sprung
up
in
the
house
it
was
leaving
behind
a
man
rising
from
his
chair
with
a
heavy
sigh
walked
to
the
parlor
window
and
looked
out
upon
lawn
and
sky
and
river
but
so
dark
had
it
grown
saw
not
the
canoe
thought
only
how
deserted
how
desolate
and
lonely
was
the
scene
in
williamsburgh
as
at
westover
the
autumn
was
dying
the
winter
was
coming
but
neither
farewell
nor
greeting
perturbed
the
cheerful
town
to
and
fro
through
palace
and
nicholson
and
duke
of
gloucester
streets
were
blown
the
gay
leaves
of
early
mornings
white
frosts
lay
upon
the
earth
like
fairy
snows
but
midday
and
afternoon
were
warm
and
bright
mistress
stagg
garden
lay
to
the
south
and
in
sheltered
corners
bloomed
marigolds
and
asters
while
a
vine
and
made
a
splendid
mantle
for
the
playhouse
wall
within
the
theatre
a
rehearsal
of
tamerlane
was
in
progress
turk
and
tartar
spoke
their
minds
and
arpasia
death
cry
clave
the
air
the
victorious
emperor
passed
final
sentence
upon
bajazet
then
chancing
to
glance
toward
the
wide
door
suddenly
abdicated
his
throne
and
in
the
character
of
charles
stagg
blew
a
kiss
to
his
wife
who
applauding
softly
stood
in
the
opening
that
was
framed
by
the
red
vine
have
you
done
my
dear
she
cried
then
pray
come
with
me
a
moment
the
two
crossed
the
garden
and
entered
the
grape
arbor
where
in
september
mistress
stagg
had
entertained
her
old
friend
my
lady
squander
sometime
now
the
vines
were
bare
of
leaves
and
the
sunshine
streaming
through
lay
in
a
flood
upon
the
earth
mary
stagg
chair
was
set
in
that
golden
warmth
and
upon
the
ground
beside
it
had
fallen
some
bright
sewing
the
silken
stuff
touched
a
coarser
cloth
and
that
was
the
skirt
of
darden
audrey
who
sat
upon
the
ground
asleep
with
her
arm
across
the
chair
and
her
head
upon
her
arm
how
came
she
here
demanded
stagg
at
last
when
he
had
given
a
tragedy
start
folded
his
arms
and
bent
his
brows
she
ran
away
answered
mistress
stagg
in
a
low
voice
drawing
her
spouse
to
a
little
distance
from
the
sleeping
figure
she
ran
away
from
the
glebe
house
and
went
up
the
river
wanting
the
lord
knows
why
to
reach
the
mountains
something
happened
to
bring
her
to
her
senses
and
she
turned
back
and
falling
in
with
that
trader
jean
hugon
he
brought
her
to
jamestown
in
his
canoe
she
walked
from
there
to
the
glebe
house
that
was
yesterday
the
minister
was
away
and
deborah
being
in
one
of
her
passions
would
not
let
her
in
she
that
hard
is
deborah
when
she
angry
harder
than
the
nether
millstone
the
girl
lay
in
the
woods
last
night
i
vow
i
never
speak
again
to
deborah
not
though
there
were
twenty
baths
behind
us
mistress
stagg
voice
began
to
tremble
i
was
sitting
sewing
in
that
chair
now
listening
to
your
voices
in
the
theatre
and
now
harking
back
in
my
mind
to
old
days
when
we
were
prosperous
like
we
are
now
and
at
last
i
got
to
thinking
of
the
babe
charles
and
how
if
she
had
lived
and
grown
up
i
might
ha
sat
there
sewing
a
pretty
gown
for
my
own
child
and
how
happy
i
would
have
made
her
i
tried
to
see
her
standing
beside
me
laughing
pretty
as
a
rose
waiting
for
me
to
take
the
last
stitch
it
got
so
real
that
i
raised
my
head
to
tell
my
dead
child
how
i
was
going
to
knot
her
ribbons
and
there
was
this
girl
looking
at
me
what
millamant
a
tear
my
soul
cried
the
theatric
stagg
millamant
wiped
away
the
tear
i
tell
you
what
she
said
she
just
said
were
kind
to
me
when
i
was
here
before
but
if
you
tell
me
to
go
away
i
go
you
need
not
say
it
loudly
and
then
she
almost
fell
and
i
put
out
my
arm
and
caught
her
and
presently
she
was
on
her
knees
there
beside
me
with
her
head
in
my
lap
and
then
we
talked
together
for
a
while
it
was
mostly
me
she
did
say
much
but
charles
the
girl
done
no
wrong
no
more
than
our
child
that
dead
and
in
bosom
she
was
so
tired
and
worn
i
got
some
milk
and
gave
it
to
her
and
directly
she
went
to
sleep
like
a
baby
with
her
head
on
my
knee
the
two
went
closer
and
looked
down
upon
the
slender
form
and
still
dark
face
the
sleeper
rest
was
deep
a
tress
of
hair
fallen
from
its
fastening
swept
her
cheek
mistress
stagg
stooping
put
it
in
place
behind
the
small
ear
then
straightened
herself
and
pressed
her
arm
well
my
love
quoth
that
gentleman
clearing
his
throat
minds
like
heaven
are
pleased
in
doing
good
my
millamant
declare
your
thoughts
mistress
stagg
twisted
her
apron
hem
between
thumb
and
finger
she
more
than
eighteen
charles
and
anyhow
if
i
understand
it
rightly
she
was
never
really
bound
to
darden
the
law
has
no
hold
on
her
for
neither
vestry
nor
orphan
court
had
anything
to
do
with
placing
her
with
darden
and
deborah
she
free
to
stay
free
to
stay
queried
charles
and
took
a
prodigious
pinch
of
snuff
to
stay
with
us
why
not
asked
his
wife
and
stole
a
persuasive
hand
into
that
of
her
helpmate
oh
charles
my
heart
went
out
to
her
i
made
her
so
beautiful
once
and
i
could
do
it
again
and
all
the
time
do
you
think
her
prettier
than
was
jane
day
and
she
graceful
and
that
quick
to
learn
you
such
a
teacher
charles
and
i
know
she
do
her
best
perhaps
after
all
there
would
be
no
need
to
send
away
to
bristol
for
one
to
take
jane
place
h
said
the
great
man
thoughtfully
and
bit
a
curl
of
tamerlane
vast
periwig
is
true
i
esteem
her
no
dullard
he
at
last
vouchsafed
true
also
that
she
hath
beauty
in
fine
solely
to
give
thee
pleasure
my
millamant
i
will
give
the
girl
a
trial
no
later
than
this
very
afternoon
audrey
stirred
in
her
sleep
spoke
haward
name
and
sank
again
to
rest
stagg
took
a
second
pinch
of
snuff
there
the
scandal
my
love
his
excellency
the
governor
ball
eliot
sermon
marmaduke
illness
and
subsequent
duels
with
everard
and
travis
are
in
no
danger
of
being
forgotten
if
this
girl
ever
comes
to
the
speaking
of
an
epilogue
there
be
in
williamsburgh
a
nine
days
wonder
indeed
the
wonder
would
not
hurt
said
mistress
stagg
simply
far
from
it
my
dear
agreed
stagg
and
closing
his
snuffbox
went
with
a
thoughtful
brow
back
to
the
playhouse
and
the
tartar
camp
chapter
xxvii
the
mission
of
truelove
mistress
truelove
taberer
having
read
in
a
very
clear
and
gentle
voice
the
sermon
on
the
mount
to
those
placid
friends
tobias
and
martha
taberer
closed
the
book
and
went
about
her
household
affairs
with
a
quiet
step
but
a
heart
that
somehow
fluttered
at
every
sound
without
the
door
to
still
it
she
began
to
repeat
to
herself
words
she
had
read
blessed
are
the
peacemakers
for
they
shall
be
called
the
children
of
god
blessed
are
the
peacemakers
winter
sunshine
poured
in
at
the
windows
and
door
truelove
kneeling
to
wipe
a
fleck
of
dust
from
her
wheel
suddenly
with
a
catch
of
her
breath
and
a
lifting
of
her
brown
eyes
saw
in
the
scripture
she
had
been
repeating
a
meaning
and
application
hitherto
unexpected
the
peacemaker
that
is
one
who
makes
peace
in
the
world
between
countries
in
families
yea
in
the
heart
of
one
alone
did
he
not
say
last
time
he
came
that
with
me
he
forgot
this
naughty
world
and
all
its
strife
that
if
i
were
always
with
him
truelove
countenance
became
exalted
her
gaze
fixed
if
it
were
a
call
she
murmured
and
for
a
moment
bowed
her
head
upon
the
wheel
then
rose
from
her
knees
and
went
softly
through
the
morning
tasks
when
they
were
over
she
took
down
from
a
peg
and
put
on
a
long
gray
cloak
and
a
gray
hood
that
most
becomingly
framed
her
face
then
came
and
stood
before
her
father
and
mother
i
am
going
forth
to
walk
by
the
creekside
she
said
in
her
sweet
voice
it
may
be
that
i
will
meet
angus
maclean
if
thee
does
answered
one
tranquil
friend
thee
may
tell
him
that
upon
next
seventh
day
meeting
will
be
held
in
this
house
truly
said
the
other
tranquil
friend
my
heart
is
drawn
toward
that
young
man
his
mind
hath
been
filled
with
anger
and
resistance
and
the
turmoil
of
the
world
it
were
well
if
he
found
peace
at
last
surely
it
were
well
agreed
truelove
sweetly
and
went
out
into
the
crisp
winter
weather
the
holly
the
pine
and
the
cedar
made
green
places
in
the
woods
and
the
multitude
of
leaves
underfoot
were
pleasant
to
tread
clouds
were
in
the
sky
but
the
spaces
between
were
of
serenest
blue
and
in
the
sunshine
the
creek
flashed
diamonds
truelove
stood
upon
the
bank
and
with
her
hand
shading
her
eyes
watched
maclean
rowing
toward
her
up
the
creek
when
he
had
fastened
his
boat
and
taken
her
hand
the
two
walked
soberly
on
beside
the
sparkling
water
until
they
came
to
a
rude
seat
built
beneath
an
to
which
yet
clung
a
number
of
brown
leaves
truelove
sat
down
drawing
her
cloak
about
her
for
though
the
sun
shone
the
air
was
keen
maclean
took
off
his
coat
and
kneeling
put
it
beneath
her
feet
he
laughed
at
her
protest
why
these
winds
are
not
bleak
he
said
this
land
knows
no
true
and
honest
cold
in
my
country
night
after
night
have
i
lain
in
snow
with
only
my
plaid
for
cover
and
heard
the
spirits
call
in
the
icy
wind
the
kelpie
shriek
beneath
the
frozen
loch
i
listened
then
shut
my
eyes
and
dreamed
warm
of
glory
and
true
love
thy
coat
is
new
said
truelove
with
downcast
eyes
the
earth
will
stain
the
good
cloth
maclean
laughed
then
will
i
wear
it
stained
as
is
said
a
courtier
once
wore
his
cloak
there
is
lace
upon
it
said
truelove
timidly
maclean
turned
with
a
smile
and
laid
a
fold
of
her
cloak
against
his
dark
cheek
ah
the
lace
offends
you
offends
thee
truelove
why
is
but
to
mark
me
a
gentleman
again
last
night
at
williamsburgh
i
supped
with
haward
and
some
gentlemen
of
virginia
he
would
have
me
don
this
suit
i
might
not
disoblige
my
friend
thee
loves
it
said
truelove
severely
thee
loves
the
color
and
the
feel
of
the
fine
cloth
and
the
ruffles
at
thy
wrists
the
highlander
laughed
why
suppose
that
i
do
look
truelove
how
brave
and
red
are
those
holly
berries
and
how
green
and
fantastically
twisted
the
leaves
the
sky
is
a
bright
blue
and
the
clouds
are
silver
and
think
what
these
woods
will
be
when
the
winter
is
past
one
might
do
worse
meseems
than
to
be
of
god
taste
in
such
matters
truelove
sighed
and
drew
her
gray
cloak
more
closely
around
her
thee
is
in
spirits
angus
maclean
she
said
and
sighed
once
more
i
am
free
he
answered
the
man
within
me
walks
no
longer
with
a
hanging
head
and
what
will
thee
do
with
thy
freedom
the
highlander
made
no
immediate
reply
but
chin
in
hand
studied
the
drifts
of
leaves
and
the
water
i
am
free
he
said
at
last
i
wear
the
dress
of
a
gentleman
i
could
walk
without
shame
into
a
hall
that
i
know
and
find
there
strangers
standers
in
dead
shoon
brothers
who
want
me
not
who
would
say
behind
their
hands
has
been
twelve
years
a
slave
and
the
world
has
changed
since
he
went
away
i
will
not
trouble
them
his
face
was
as
sombre
as
when
truelove
first
beheld
it
suddenly
and
against
her
will
tears
came
to
her
eyes
i
am
glad
i
and
my
father
and
mother
and
ephraim
that
thee
goes
not
overseas
angus
maclean
said
the
dove
voice
we
would
have
thee
i
and
my
father
and
mother
and
ephraim
we
would
have
thee
stay
in
virginia
i
am
to
stay
he
answered
i
have
felt
no
shame
in
taking
a
loan
from
my
friend
for
i
shall
repay
it
he
hath
lands
up
river
in
a
county
i
am
to
seat
them
for
him
and
there
will
be
my
home
i
will
build
a
house
and
name
it
duart
and
if
there
are
hills
they
shall
be
and
grieg
and
the
sound
of
winter
torrents
shall
be
to
me
as
the
sound
of
the
waters
of
mull
truelove
caught
her
breath
thee
will
be
lonely
in
those
forests
i
am
used
to
loneliness
there
be
indians
on
the
frontier
they
burn
houses
and
carry
away
prisoners
and
there
are
wolves
and
dangerous
beasts
i
am
used
to
danger
truelove
voice
trembled
more
and
more
and
thee
must
dwell
among
negroes
and
rude
men
with
none
to
comfort
thy
soul
none
to
whom
thee
can
speak
in
thy
dark
hours
before
now
i
have
spoken
to
the
tobacco
i
have
planted
the
trees
i
have
felled
the
swords
and
muskets
i
have
sold
but
at
last
thee
came
and
spoke
to
me
ay
he
answered
there
have
been
times
when
you
saved
my
soul
alive
now
in
the
forest
in
my
house
of
logs
when
the
day
work
is
done
and
i
sit
upon
my
doorstep
and
begin
to
hear
the
voices
of
the
past
crying
to
me
like
the
spirits
in
the
valley
of
glensyte
i
will
think
of
you
instead
oh
cried
truelove
speak
to
me
instead
and
i
will
speak
to
thee
sitting
upon
the
doorstep
of
our
house
when
our
day
work
is
done
her
hood
falling
back
showed
her
face
clear
pink
with
dewy
eyes
the
carnation
deepening
from
brow
to
throat
and
the
tears
trembling
upon
her
long
lashes
she
suddenly
hid
her
countenance
in
her
gray
cloak
maclean
on
his
knees
beside
her
drew
away
the
folds
truelove
truelove
do
you
know
what
you
have
said
truelove
put
her
hand
upon
her
heart
oh
i
fear
she
whispered
i
fear
that
i
have
asked
thee
angus
maclean
to
let
me
be
to
let
me
be
thy
wife
the
water
shone
and
the
holly
berries
were
gay
and
a
robin
redbreast
sang
a
cheerful
song
beneath
the
rustling
there
was
ardent
speech
on
the
part
of
maclean
who
found
in
his
mistress
a
listener
sweet
and
shy
and
not
garrulous
of
love
but
her
eyes
dwelt
upon
him
and
her
hand
rested
at
ease
within
his
clasp
and
she
liked
to
hear
him
speak
of
the
home
they
were
to
make
in
the
wilderness
it
was
to
be
thus
and
thus
and
thus
with
impassioned
eloquence
the
gael
adorned
the
shrine
and
advanced
the
merit
of
the
divinity
and
the
divinity
listened
with
a
smile
a
blush
a
tear
and
now
and
then
a
meek
rebuke
when
an
hour
had
passed
the
sun
went
under
a
cloud
and
the
air
grew
colder
the
bird
had
flown
away
but
in
the
rising
wind
the
dead
leaves
rustled
loudly
maclean
and
truelove
leaving
their
future
of
honorable
toil
peace
of
mind
and
enduring
affection
came
back
to
the
present
i
must
away
said
the
highlander
haward
waits
for
me
at
williamsburgh
dearer
to
me
than
deirdre
to
naos
i
will
come
again
hand
in
hand
the
two
walked
slowly
toward
that
haunt
of
peace
quiet
home
and
marmaduke
haward
awaits
thee
at
williamsburgh
said
the
quakeress
last
third
day
he
met
my
father
and
me
on
the
fair
view
road
and
checked
his
horse
and
spoke
to
us
he
is
changed
changed
indeed
quoth
the
highlander
a
fire
burns
him
a
wind
drives
him
and
yet
to
the
world
last
night
he
paused
last
night
said
truelove
he
had
a
large
company
at
marot
ordinary
went
on
the
other
there
were
the
governor
and
his
fellow
councilors
with
others
of
condition
or
fashion
he
was
the
very
fine
gentleman
the
perfect
host
free
smiling
full
of
wit
but
i
had
been
with
him
before
they
came
i
knew
the
fires
beneath
the
two
walked
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
when
maclean
spoke
again
he
drank
to
her
at
the
last
when
this
lady
had
been
toasted
and
that
he
rose
and
drank
to
and
threw
his
wineglass
over
his
shoulder
he
hath
done
what
he
could
the
world
knows
that
he
loves
her
honorably
seeks
her
vainly
in
marriage
something
more
i
know
he
gathered
the
company
together
last
evening
that
as
his
guests
the
highest
officers
the
finest
gentlemen
of
the
colony
should
go
with
him
to
the
theatre
to
see
her
for
the
first
time
as
a
player
being
what
they
were
and
his
guests
and
his
passion
known
he
would
insure
for
her
did
she
well
or
did
she
ill
order
interest
decent
applause
maclean
broke
off
with
a
short
excited
laugh
it
was
not
needed
his
mediation
but
he
could
not
know
that
no
nor
none
of
us
true
stagg
and
his
wife
had
bragged
of
the
powers
of
this
strangely
found
actress
of
theirs
that
they
were
training
to
do
great
things
but
folk
took
it
for
a
trick
of
their
trade
oh
there
was
curiosity
enough
but
was
on
haward
account
well
he
drank
to
her
standing
at
the
head
of
the
table
at
marot
ordinary
and
the
glass
crashed
over
his
shoulder
and
we
all
went
to
the
play
yes
yes
cried
truelove
breathing
quickly
and
quite
forgetting
how
great
a
vanity
was
under
discussion
was
the
play
that
this
traitorous
generation
calls
for
every
of
november
it
seems
that
the
governor
a
whig
as
rank
as
argyle
had
ordered
it
again
for
this
week
is
a
cursed
piece
of
slander
that
pictures
the
prince
of
orange
a
virtuous
emperor
his
late
majesty
of
france
a
hateful
tyrant
but
for
haward
whose
guest
i
was
i
had
not
sat
there
with
closed
lips
i
had
sprung
to
my
feet
and
given
those
flatterers
those
traducers
the
lie
the
thing
taunted
and
angered
until
she
entered
then
i
forgot
and
she
and
audrey
arpasia
was
her
name
in
the
play
she
entered
late
her
death
came
before
the
end
there
was
another
woman
who
had
more
to
do
it
all
mattered
not
i
have
seen
a
great
actress
darden
audrey
said
truelove
in
a
whisper
that
at
the
very
first
not
afterwards
answered
maclean
she
was
dressed
they
say
as
upon
the
night
at
the
palace
that
first
night
of
haward
fever
when
she
came
upon
the
stage
there
was
a
murmur
like
the
wind
in
the
leaves
she
was
most
beautiful
in
hatred
as
the
sultan
in
the
play
called
her
dark
and
wonderful
with
angry
eyes
for
a
little
while
she
must
stand
in
silence
and
in
these
moments
men
and
women
stared
at
her
then
turned
and
looked
at
haward
but
when
she
spoke
we
forgot
that
she
was
darden
audrey
maclean
laughed
again
when
the
play
was
ended
or
rather
when
her
part
in
it
was
done
the
house
did
shake
so
with
applause
that
stagg
had
to
remonstrate
there
naught
talked
of
in
williamsburgh
but
arpasia
and
when
i
came
down
palace
street
this
morning
there
was
a
great
crowd
about
the
playhouse
door
stagg
might
sell
his
tickets
for
at
a
guinea
apiece
preserved
is
the
play
and
marmaduke
haward
what
of
him
asked
truelove
softly
he
is
english
said
maclean
after
a
pause
he
can
make
of
his
face
a
smiling
mask
can
keep
his
voice
as
even
and
as
still
as
the
pool
that
is
a
mile
away
from
the
fierce
torrent
its
parent
it
is
a
gift
they
have
the
english
i
remember
at
preston
he
broke
off
with
a
sigh
there
will
be
an
end
some
day
i
suppose
he
will
win
her
at
last
to
his
way
of
thinking
and
having
gained
her
he
will
be
happy
and
yet
to
my
mind
there
is
something
unfortunate
strange
and
fatal
in
the
aspect
of
this
girl
it
hath
always
been
so
she
is
such
a
one
as
the
lady
in
green
on
a
halloween
night
standing
in
the
twelfth
rig
a
man
might
hear
her
voice
upon
the
wind
i
would
old
murdoch
of
coll
who
hath
the
second
sight
were
here
he
could
tell
the
ending
of
it
all
an
hour
later
found
the
highlander
well
upon
his
way
to
williamsburgh
walking
through
wood
and
field
with
his
long
stride
his
heart
warm
within
him
his
mind
filled
with
the
thought
of
truelove
and
the
home
that
he
would
make
for
her
in
the
rude
upriver
country
since
the
two
had
sat
beneath
the
oak
clouds
had
gathered
obscuring
the
sun
it
was
now
gray
and
cold
in
the
forest
and
presently
snow
began
to
fall
slowly
in
large
flakes
between
the
still
trees
maclean
looked
with
whimsical
anxiety
at
several
white
particles
upon
his
suit
of
fine
cloth
and
and
quickened
his
pace
but
the
snow
was
but
the
lazy
vanguard
of
a
storm
and
so
few
and
harmless
were
the
flakes
that
when
a
mile
from
williamsburgh
and
at
some
little
distance
from
the
road
maclean
beheld
a
ring
of
figures
seated
upon
the
gounod
beneath
a
giant
elm
he
stopped
to
observe
who
and
what
they
were
that
sat
so
still
beneath
the
leafless
tree
in
the
winter
weather
the
group
that
at
first
glimpse
had
seemed
some
conclave
of
beings
uncouth
and
lubberly
and
solely
of
the
forest
resolved
itself
into
the
indian
teacher
and
his
pupils
escaped
for
the
afternoon
from
the
bounds
of
william
and
mary
the
indian
lads
slender
bronze
and
statuesque
sat
in
silence
stolidly
listening
to
the
words
of
the
white
man
who
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
ring
with
his
back
to
the
told
to
his
dusky
charges
a
bible
tale
it
was
the
story
of
joseph
and
his
brethren
the
clear
gentle
tones
of
the
teacher
reached
maclean
ears
where
he
stood
unobserved
behind
a
roadside
growth
of
bay
and
cedar
a
touch
upon
the
shoulder
made
him
turn
to
find
at
his
elbow
that
sometime
pupil
of
charles
griffin
in
whose
company
he
had
once
trudged
from
fair
view
store
to
williamsburgh
i
was
lying
in
the
woods
over
there
said
hugon
sullenly
i
heard
them
coming
and
i
took
my
leave
said
i
old
weak
man
who
preaches
quietness
under
men
injuries
and
the
young
wolf
pack
all
brown
with
indian
names
they
may
have
the
woods
for
me
i
go
back
to
the
town
where
i
belong
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
stood
scowling
at
the
distant
group
maclean
in
his
turn
looked
curiously
at
his
quondam
companion
of
a
sunny
day
in
may
the
assassin
with
whom
he
had
struggled
in
wind
and
rain
beneath
the
thunders
of
an
august
storm
the
trader
wore
his
great
wig
his
ancient
steinkirk
of
tawdry
lace
his
high
boots
of
spanish
leather
cracked
and
stained
between
the
waves
of
coarse
hair
out
of
eyes
looked
the
soul
of
the
fierce
vengeful
ignorant
and
embittered
there
is
meshawa
he
said
meshawa
who
was
a
little
boy
when
i
went
to
school
but
who
used
to
laugh
when
i
talked
of
france
pardieu
one
day
i
found
him
alone
when
it
was
cold
and
there
was
a
fire
in
the
room
next
time
i
talked
he
did
not
laugh
they
are
all
he
swept
his
hand
toward
the
circle
beneath
the
elm
they
are
all
saponies
nottoways
meherrins
their
fathers
are
lovers
of
the
peace
pipe
and
humble
to
the
english
a
monacan
is
a
great
brave
he
laughs
at
the
nottoways
and
says
that
there
are
no
men
in
the
villages
of
the
meherrins
when
do
you
go
again
to
trade
with
your
people
asked
maclean
hugon
glanced
at
him
out
of
the
corners
of
his
black
eyes
they
are
not
my
people
my
people
are
french
i
am
not
going
to
the
woods
any
more
i
am
so
prosperous
diable
shall
not
i
as
well
as
another
stay
at
williamsburgh
dress
fine
dwell
in
an
ordinary
play
high
and
drink
of
the
best
there
is
none
will
prevent
you
said
maclean
coolly
dwell
in
town
take
your
ease
in
your
inn
wear
gold
lace
stake
the
skins
of
all
the
deer
in
virginia
drink
burgundy
and
champagne
but
lay
no
more
arrows
athwart
the
threshold
of
a
gentleman
door
hugon
lips
twitched
into
a
tigerish
grimace
so
he
found
the
arrow
mortdieu
let
him
look
to
it
that
one
day
the
arrow
find
not
him
if
i
were
haward
said
maclean
i
would
have
you
taken
up
the
trader
again
looked
sideways
at
the
speaker
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
waved
his
hand
oh
he
he
despises
me
too
much
for
that
eh
bien
i
love
to
see
him
live
when
there
is
no
wine
in
the
cup
but
only
dregs
that
are
bitter
i
laugh
to
see
it
at
his
lips
she
audrey
that
never
before
could
i
coax
into
my
boat
she
reached
me
her
hand
she
came
with
me
down
the
river
through
the
and
left
him
behind
at
westover
ha
think
you
not
that
was
bitter
that
drink
which
she
gave
him
marmaduke
haward
of
fair
view
since
then
if
i
go
to
that
house
that
garden
at
williamsburgh
she
hides
she
will
not
see
me
the
man
and
his
wife
make
excuse
bad
but
also
he
sees
her
never
he
writes
to
her
she
answers
not
good
let
him
live
with
the
fire
built
around
him
and
the
splinters
in
his
heart
he
laughed
again
and
dismissing
the
subject
with
airiness
somewhat
exaggerated
drew
out
his
huge
gilt
snuffbox
the
snow
was
now
falling
more
thickly
drawing
a
white
and
fleecy
veil
between
the
two
upon
the
road
and
the
and
his
audience
beneath
the
distant
elm
are
you
for
williamsburgh
demanded
the
highlander
when
he
had
somewhat
abruptly
declined
to
take
snuff
with
monsieur
jean
hugon
that
worthy
nodded
pocketing
his
box
and
incidentally
making
a
great
jingling
of
coins
then
quoth
maclean
since
i
prefer
to
travel
alone
twill
wait
here
until
you
have
passed
the
in
the
distance
yonder
to
you
he
seated
himself
upon
the
stump
of
a
tree
and
giving
all
his
attention
to
the
snow
began
to
whistle
a
thoughtful
air
hugon
glanced
at
him
with
fierce
black
eyes
and
twitching
lips
much
desiring
a
quarrel
then
thought
better
of
it
and
before
the
tune
had
come
to
an
end
was
making
with
his
long
and
noiseless
stride
his
lonely
way
to
williamsburgh
and
the
ordinary
in
nicholson
street
chapter
xxviii
the
player
about
this
time
charles
stagg
of
the
williamsburgh
theatre
in
virginia
sent
by
the
horn
of
plenty
bound
for
london
a
long
letter
to
an
ancient
comrade
and
player
of
small
parts
at
drury
lane
a
few
days
later
young
lee
writing
by
the
golden
lucy
to
an
agreeable
rake
of
his
acquaintance
burst
into
a
panegyric
upon
the
arpasia
the
belvidera
the
monimia
who
had
so
marvelously
dawned
upon
the
colonial
horizon
the
recipient
of
this
communication
being
a
frequenter
of
button
and
chancing
one
day
to
crack
a
bottle
there
with
colley
cibber
drew
from
his
pocket
and
read
to
that
gentleman
the
eulogy
of
darden
audrey
with
the
remark
that
the
writer
was
an
oxford
man
and
must
know
whereof
he
wrote
cibber
borrowed
the
letter
and
the
next
day
in
the
company
of
wilks
and
a
bottle
of
burgundy
compared
it
with
that
of
charles
stagg
the
latter
correspondent
having
also
brought
the
matter
to
the
great
notice
she
might
offset
that
pretty
jade
fenton
at
the
fields
eh
bob
said
cibber
they
of
an
age
if
the
town
took
to
her
if
her
belvidera
made
one
pretty
fellow
weep
why
not
another
added
wilks
here
where
he
says
that
when
she
went
out
for
many
moments
the
pit
was
silent
as
the
grave
and
that
then
the
applause
was
deep
not
shrill
and
very
long
if
is
a
barry
come
again
and
we
could
lay
hands
on
her
the
house
would
be
made
gibber
sighed
you
dreaming
bob
he
said
was
but
a
pack
of
virginia
planters
noisy
over
some
with
a
ranting
tongue
men
passions
are
the
same
i
take
it
in
virginia
as
in
london
answered
the
other
if
the
can
move
to
that
manner
of
applause
in
one
spot
of
earth
she
may
do
so
in
another
and
here
again
he
says
dark
beauty
with
a
strange
alluring
air
a
voice
of
melting
sweetness
that
yet
can
so
express
anguish
and
fear
that
the
blood
turns
cold
and
the
heart
is
wrung
to
hear
it
zoons
sir
what
would
it
cost
to
buy
off
this
fellow
stagg
and
to
bring
the
phoenix
overseas
something
more
than
a
lottery
ticket
laughed
the
other
and
beckoned
to
the
drawer
we
wait
bob
until
we
sure
is
a
phoenix
indeed
there
a
gentleman
in
virginia
with
whom
i
some
acquaintance
colonel
william
byrd
that
was
the
colony
agent
here
i
write
to
him
for
a
true
account
there
time
enough
so
thought
honest
cibber
and
wrote
at
leisure
to
his
virginia
acquaintance
it
made
small
difference
whether
he
wrote
or
refrained
from
writing
for
he
had
naught
to
do
with
the
destinies
of
darden
audrey
was
almost
summer
before
there
came
an
answer
to
his
letter
he
showed
it
to
wilks
in
the
greenroom
between
the
acts
of
the
provoked
husband
oldfield
read
it
over
their
shoulders
and
vowed
that
was
a
moving
story
nay
more
in
her
next
scene
there
was
a
moisture
in
lady
eyes
quite
out
of
keeping
with
the
vivacity
of
her
lines
darden
audrey
had
to
do
with
virginia
not
london
with
the
winter
never
more
the
summer
it
is
not
known
how
acceptable
her
monimia
her
belvidera
her
isabella
would
have
been
to
london
playgoers
perhaps
they
would
have
received
them
as
did
the
virginians
perhaps
not
cibber
himself
might
or
might
not
have
drawn
for
us
her
portrait
might
or
might
not
have
dwelt
upon
the
speaking
eye
the
slow
exquisite
smile
with
which
she
made
more
sad
her
saddest
utterances
the
wild
charm
of
her
mirth
her
power
to
make
each
auditor
fear
as
his
own
the
impending
harm
the
tragic
splendor
in
which
when
the
bolt
had
fallen
converged
all
the
pathos
beauty
and
tenderness
of
her
earlier
scenes
a
virginian
of
that
winter
writing
of
her
had
written
thus
but
then
williamsburgh
was
not
london
nor
its
playhouse
drury
lane
perhaps
upon
that
ruder
stage
before
an
audience
less
polite
with
never
a
critic
in
the
pit
or
footman
in
the
gallery
with
no
fops
corner
and
no
great
number
of
fine
ladies
in
the
boxes
the
jewel
shone
with
a
lustre
that
in
a
brighter
light
it
had
not
worn
there
was
in
charles
stagg
company
of
players
no
mate
for
any
gem
this
one
was
set
amongst
pebbles
and
perhaps
by
contrast
alone
did
it
glow
so
deeply
however
this
may
be
in
virginia
in
the
winter
and
the
early
spring
of
that
year
of
grace
darden
audrey
was
known
extravagantly
praised
toasted
applauded
to
the
echo
night
after
night
saw
the
theatre
crowded
gallery
pit
and
boxes
even
the
stage
had
its
row
of
chairs
seats
held
not
too
dear
at
half
a
guinea
stagg
had
visions
of
a
larger
house
a
fuller
company
renown
and
prosperity
undreamed
of
before
that
fortunate
day
when
in
the
grape
arbor
he
and
his
wife
had
stood
and
watched
darden
audrey
asleep
with
her
head
pillowed
upon
her
arm
darden
audrey
the
name
clung
to
her
though
the
minister
had
no
further
lot
or
part
in
her
fate
the
poetasters
called
her
charmante
anwet
chloe
what
not
young
lee
in
many
a
slight
and
pleasing
set
of
verses
addressed
her
as
sylvia
but
to
the
community
at
large
she
was
darden
audrey
and
an
enigma
greater
than
the
sphinx
why
would
she
not
marry
marmaduke
haward
of
fair
view
was
the
girl
looking
for
a
prince
to
come
overseas
for
her
or
did
she
prefer
to
a
dazzling
marriage
the
excitement
of
the
theatre
the
adulation
furious
applause
that
could
hardly
be
for
these
things
seemed
to
frighten
her
at
times
one
could
see
her
shrink
and
grow
pale
at
some
great
clapping
or
loud
again
and
only
upon
the
stage
did
the
town
behold
her
she
rarely
went
abroad
and
at
the
small
white
house
in
palace
street
she
was
denied
to
visitors
true
was
the
way
to
keep
upon
curiosity
the
keenest
edge
to
pique
interest
and
send
the
town
to
the
playhouse
as
the
one
point
of
view
from
which
the
riddle
might
be
studied
but
wisdom
such
as
this
could
scarce
be
expected
of
the
girl
given
then
that
was
not
her
vanity
which
kept
her
darden
audrey
what
was
it
was
not
haward
of
fair
view
rich
handsome
a
very
fine
gentleman
generous
too
for
had
he
not
sworn
as
earnestly
as
though
he
expected
to
be
believed
that
the
girl
was
pure
innocence
his
hand
was
ready
to
his
sword
nor
were
men
anxious
to
incur
his
cold
enmity
so
that
the
assertion
passed
without
open
challenge
he
was
mad
for
her
that
was
plain
enough
and
she
well
she
woman
and
darden
audrey
and
so
doubly
an
enigma
in
the
mean
time
she
plays
monimia
and
her
madness
makes
you
weep
so
sad
it
is
so
hopeless
and
so
piercing
sweet
in
this
new
world
that
was
so
strange
to
her
darden
audrey
bore
herself
as
best
she
might
while
it
was
day
she
kept
within
the
house
where
the
room
that
in
september
she
had
shared
with
mistress
deborah
was
now
for
her
alone
hour
after
hour
she
sat
there
book
in
hand
learning
how
those
other
women
those
women
of
the
past
had
loved
had
suffered
had
fallen
to
dusty
death
other
hours
she
spent
with
charles
stagg
in
the
long
room
downstairs
or
when
mistress
stagg
had
customers
in
the
theatre
itself
as
in
the
branded
schoolmaster
chance
had
given
her
a
teacher
skilled
in
imparting
knowledge
so
in
this
small
and
pompous
man
who
beneath
a
garb
of
fustian
hugged
to
himself
a
genuine
reverence
and
understanding
of
his
art
she
found
an
instructor
more
able
perhaps
than
had
been
a
greater
actor
in
the
chill
and
empty
playhouse
upon
the
narrow
stage
where
sitting
in
the
september
sunshine
she
had
asked
of
haward
her
last
favor
she
now
learned
to
speak
for
those
sisters
of
her
spirit
those
dead
women
who
through
rapture
agony
and
madness
had
sunk
to
their
long
rest
had
given
their
hands
to
death
and
lain
down
in
a
common
inn
to
audrey
they
were
real
she
was
free
of
their
company
the
shadows
were
the
people
who
lived
and
were
happy
who
night
after
night
came
to
watch
a
soul
caught
in
the
toils
to
thunder
applause
when
death
with
rude
and
hasty
hands
broke
the
net
set
free
the
prisoner
the
girl
dreamed
as
she
breathed
wakened
from
a
long
long
fantasy
desolate
and
cold
to
the
heart
in
an
alien
air
she
sought
for
poppy
and
mandragora
and
in
some
sort
finding
them
dreamed
again
though
not
for
herself
not
as
before
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
she
was
unhappy
she
walked
in
a
pageant
of
strange
miseries
and
the
pomp
of
woe
was
hers
to
portray
those
changelings
from
some
fateful
land
those
passionate
pale
women
the
milestones
of
whose
pilgrimage
spelled
love
ruin
despair
and
death
they
were
her
kindred
her
sisters
day
and
night
they
kept
her
company
and
her
own
pain
lessened
grew
at
last
to
a
still
and
dreamy
sorrow
never
absent
never
poignant
of
necessity
importunate
grief
was
drugged
to
sleep
in
the
daylight
hours
she
must
study
must
rehearse
with
her
fellow
players
when
night
came
she
put
on
a
beautiful
dress
and
to
lights
and
music
and
loud
applause
there
entered
monimia
or
belvidera
or
athenais
when
the
play
was
done
and
the
curtain
fallen
the
crowd
of
those
who
would
have
stayed
her
ever
gave
way
daunted
by
her
eyes
her
closed
lips
the
atmosphere
that
yet
wrapped
her
of
passion
woe
and
exaltation
the
very
tragedy
of
the
soul
that
she
had
so
richly
painted
like
the
ghost
of
that
woman
who
had
so
direfully
loved
and
died
she
was
wont
to
slip
from
the
playhouse
through
the
dark
garden
to
the
small
white
house
and
her
quiet
room
there
she
laid
off
her
gorgeous
dress
and
drew
the
ornaments
from
her
dark
hair
that
was
long
as
molly
had
been
that
day
beneath
the
in
the
valley
she
rarely
thought
of
molly
now
or
of
the
mountains
with
her
hair
shadowing
her
face
and
streaming
over
bared
neck
and
bosom
she
sat
before
her
mirror
the
candle
burned
low
the
face
in
the
glass
seemed
not
her
own
dim
pale
at
last
out
of
a
mist
and
from
a
great
distance
the
other
woman
looked
at
her
far
countries
the
burning
noonday
and
utter
love
night
and
woe
and
life
the
broken
toy
flung
with
haste
away
the
mist
thickened
the
face
withdrew
farther
farther
off
the
candle
burned
low
audrey
put
out
the
weak
flame
and
laid
herself
upon
the
bed
sleep
came
soon
and
it
was
still
and
dreamless
sometimes
mary
stagg
light
in
hand
stole
into
the
room
and
stood
above
the
quiet
form
the
girl
hardly
seemed
to
breathe
she
had
a
fashion
of
lying
with
crossed
hands
and
head
drawn
slightly
back
much
as
she
might
be
laid
at
last
in
her
final
bed
mistress
stagg
put
out
a
timid
hand
and
felt
the
flesh
if
it
were
warm
then
bent
and
lightly
kissed
hand
or
arm
or
the
soft
curve
of
the
throat
audrey
stirred
not
and
the
other
went
noiselessly
away
or
audrey
opened
dark
eyes
faintly
smiled
and
raised
herself
to
meet
the
caress
then
sank
to
rest
again
into
mistress
stagg
life
had
struck
a
shaft
of
colored
light
had
come
a
note
of
strange
music
had
flown
a
bird
of
paradise
it
was
and
it
was
not
her
dead
child
come
again
she
knew
that
her
lucy
had
never
been
thus
and
the
love
that
she
gave
audrey
was
hardly
mother
love
it
was
more
nearly
an
homage
which
had
she
tried
she
could
not
have
explained
when
they
were
alone
together
audrey
called
the
older
woman
mother
often
knelt
and
laid
her
head
upon
the
other
lap
or
shoulder
in
all
her
ways
she
was
sweet
and
duteous
grateful
and
eager
to
serve
but
her
spirit
dwelt
in
a
rarer
air
and
there
were
heights
and
depths
where
the
waif
and
her
protectress
might
not
meet
to
this
the
latter
gave
dumb
recognition
and
though
she
could
not
understand
yet
loved
her
protégée
at
night
in
the
playhouse
this
love
was
heightened
into
exultant
worship
at
all
times
there
was
delight
in
the
girl
beauty
pride
in
the
comment
and
wonder
of
the
town
and
the
pleasing
knowledge
that
wisdom
is
vindicated
of
its
children
was
not
all
this
of
her
bringing
about
did
it
not
first
occur
to
her
that
the
child
might
take
jane
day
place
even
charles
who
strutted
and
plumed
himself
and
offered
his
snuffbox
to
every
must
acknowledge
that
mistress
stagg
stopped
her
sewing
to
laugh
triumphantly
then
fell
to
work
more
diligently
than
ever
for
it
was
her
pleasure
to
dress
darden
audrey
richly
in
soft
colors
heavy
silken
stuffs
upon
which
was
lavished
a
wealth
of
delicate
needlework
it
was
chiefly
while
she
sat
and
sewed
upon
these
pretty
things
with
audrey
book
on
knee
close
beside
her
that
her
own
child
seemed
to
breathe
again
audrey
thanked
her
and
kissed
her
and
wore
what
she
was
given
to
wear
nor
thought
how
her
beauty
was
enhanced
if
others
saw
it
if
the
wonder
grew
by
what
it
fed
on
if
she
was
talked
of
written
of
pledged
and
lauded
by
a
frank
and
susceptible
people
she
knew
of
all
this
little
enough
and
for
what
she
knew
cared
not
at
all
her
days
went
dreamily
by
nor
very
sad
nor
happy
full
of
work
yet
vague
and
unmarked
as
desert
sands
what
was
real
was
a
past
that
was
not
hers
and
those
dead
women
to
whom
night
by
night
she
gave
life
and
splendor
there
were
visitors
to
whom
she
was
not
denied
darden
came
at
times
sat
in
mistress
stagg
sunny
parlor
and
talked
to
his
sometime
ward
much
as
he
had
talked
in
the
living
room
discursively
of
men
and
parochial
affairs
and
his
own
unmerited
woes
audrey
sat
and
heard
him
with
her
eyes
upon
the
garden
without
the
window
when
he
lifted
from
the
chair
his
great
shambling
figure
and
took
his
stained
old
hat
and
heavy
cane
audrey
rose
also
curtsied
and
sent
her
duty
to
mistress
deborah
but
she
asked
no
questions
as
to
that
past
home
of
hers
it
seemed
not
to
interest
her
that
the
creek
was
frozen
so
hard
that
one
could
walk
upon
it
to
fair
view
or
that
the
minister
had
bought
a
field
from
his
wealthy
neighbor
and
meant
to
plant
it
with
oronoko
only
when
he
told
her
that
the
little
wood
the
wood
that
she
had
called
her
own
was
being
cleared
and
that
all
day
could
be
heard
the
falling
of
the
trees
did
she
lift
startled
eyes
and
draw
a
breath
like
a
moan
the
minister
looked
at
her
from
under
shaggy
brows
shook
his
head
and
went
his
way
to
his
favorite
ordinary
rum
and
a
hand
at
cards
mistress
deborah
she
beheld
no
more
but
once
the
widow
constance
brought
barbara
to
town
and
the
two
being
very
simple
women
went
to
the
play
to
see
the
old
audrey
and
saw
instead
a
queen
tinseled
clad
in
silk
who
loved
and
triumphed
despaired
and
died
the
rude
theatre
shook
to
the
applause
when
it
was
all
over
the
widow
and
barbara
went
dazed
to
their
lodging
and
lay
awake
through
the
night
talking
of
these
marvels
in
the
morning
they
found
the
small
white
house
and
audrey
came
to
them
in
the
garden
when
she
had
kissed
them
the
three
sat
down
in
the
arbor
for
it
was
a
fine
sunny
morning
and
not
cold
but
the
talk
was
not
easy
barbara
eyes
were
so
round
and
the
widow
kept
mincing
her
words
only
when
they
were
joined
by
mistress
stagg
to
whom
the
widow
became
voluble
the
two
girls
spoke
aside
i
have
a
guinea
barbara
said
audrey
stagg
gave
it
to
me
and
i
need
it
not
i
need
naught
in
the
world
barbara
here
is
for
a
warm
dress
and
a
sunday
hood
oh
audrey
breathed
barbara
they
say
you
might
live
at
fair
view
that
you
might
marry
haward
and
be
a
fine
lady
audrey
laid
her
hand
upon
the
other
lips
hush
see
barbara
you
must
have
the
dress
made
thus
like
mine
but
if
is
so
audrey
persisted
poor
barbara
mother
and
i
talked
of
it
last
night
she
said
you
would
want
a
and
i
thought
oh
audrey
audrey
bit
her
quivering
lip
and
dashed
away
the
tears
i
want
no
barbara
i
naught
but
audrey
that
you
used
to
be
kind
to
let
talk
of
other
things
have
you
missed
me
from
the
woods
all
these
days
it
has
been
long
since
you
were
there
said
barbara
dully
now
i
go
with
joan
at
times
though
mother
frowns
and
says
she
is
not
fit
eh
audrey
if
i
could
have
a
dress
of
red
silk
with
gold
and
bright
stones
like
you
wore
last
night
old
days
i
had
more
than
you
but
all
changed
now
joan
says
the
widow
constance
rising
to
take
leave
it
did
not
appear
what
joan
had
said
the
visitors
from
the
country
went
away
nor
came
again
while
audrey
dwelt
in
williamsburgh
the
schoolmaster
came
and
while
he
waited
for
his
sometime
pupil
to
slowly
descend
the
stairs
talked
learnedly
to
stagg
of
native
genius
of
the
mind
drawn
steadily
through
all
accidents
and
adversities
to
the
end
of
its
own
discovery
and
of
how
time
and
tide
and
all
the
winds
of
heaven
conspire
to
bring
the
fate
assigned
to
make
the
puppet
move
in
the
stated
measure
stagg
nodded
took
out
his
snuffbox
and
asked
what
now
was
the
schoolmaster
opinion
of
the
monimia
last
night
the
last
act
for
instance
good
lord
how
still
the
house
was
and
then
one
long
sigh
the
schoolmaster
fingered
the
scars
in
his
bands
as
was
his
manner
at
times
but
kept
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
when
he
spoke
there
was
in
his
voice
unwonted
life
why
sir
i
could
have
said
with
lear
passio
down
thou
climbing
sorrow
and
i
am
not
a
man
sir
easily
moved
the
girl
is
greatly
gifted
i
knew
that
before
either
you
or
the
town
sir
audrey
such
as
these
from
out
her
old
life
darden
audrey
saw
and
talked
with
others
sought
her
watched
for
her
laid
traps
that
might
achieve
at
least
her
presence
but
largely
in
vain
she
kept
within
the
house
when
the
knocker
sounded
she
went
to
her
own
room
no
flowery
message
compliment
or
appeal
not
even
mary
stagg
kindly
importunity
could
bring
her
from
that
coign
of
vantage
there
were
times
when
mistress
stagg
showroom
was
crowded
with
customers
on
sunny
days
young
men
left
the
bowling
green
to
stroll
in
the
garden
paths
gentlemen
and
ladies
of
quality
passing
up
and
down
palace
street
walked
more
slowly
when
they
came
to
the
small
white
house
and
looked
to
see
if
the
face
of
darden
audrey
showed
at
any
window
thus
the
winter
wore
away
the
springtime
was
at
hand
when
one
day
the
governor
wrought
upon
by
mistress
evelyn
byrd
sent
to
stagg
bidding
him
with
his
wife
and
the
new
player
to
the
palace
the
three
dressed
in
their
best
were
ushered
into
the
where
they
found
his
excellency
at
chess
with
the
a
third
gentleman
seated
somewhat
in
the
shadow
watching
the
game
a
servant
placed
chairs
for
the
people
from
the
theatre
his
excellency
checkmated
his
antagonist
and
leaning
back
in
his
great
chair
looked
at
darden
audrey
but
addressed
his
conversation
to
charles
stagg
the
great
man
was
condescendingly
affable
the
lesser
one
obsequious
while
they
talked
the
gentleman
in
the
shadow
arose
and
drew
his
chair
to
audrey
side
was
colonel
byrd
and
he
spoke
to
the
girl
kindly
and
courteously
asking
after
her
welfare
giving
her
her
meed
of
praise
dwelling
half
humorously
upon
the
astonishment
and
delight
into
which
she
had
surprised
the
town
audrey
listened
with
downcast
eyes
to
the
suave
tones
the
compliments
but
when
she
must
speak
spoke
quietly
and
well
at
last
the
governor
turned
toward
her
and
began
to
ask
questions
and
to
give
pompous
encouragement
to
the
new
player
no
reference
was
made
to
that
other
time
when
she
had
visited
the
palace
a
servant
poured
for
each
of
the
three
a
glass
of
wine
his
excellency
graciously
desired
that
they
shortly
give
again
that
being
a
play
which
as
a
true
whig
and
a
hater
of
all
tyrants
he
much
delighted
in
and
as
graciously
announced
his
intention
of
bestowing
upon
the
company
two
slightly
tarnished
birthday
suits
the
great
man
then
arose
and
the
audience
was
over
outside
the
house
in
the
sunny
walk
leading
to
the
gates
the
three
from
the
theatre
met
full
face
a
lady
and
two
gentlemen
who
had
been
sauntering
up
and
down
in
the
pleasant
weather
the
lady
was
evelyn
byrd
the
gentlemen
were
lee
and
grymes
audrey
moving
slightly
in
advance
of
her
companions
halted
at
the
sight
of
evelyn
and
the
rich
color
surged
to
her
face
but
the
other
pale
and
lovely
kept
her
composure
and
with
a
smile
and
a
few
graceful
words
of
greeting
curtsied
deeply
to
the
player
audrey
with
a
little
catch
of
her
breath
returned
the
curtsy
both
women
were
richly
dressed
both
were
beautiful
it
seemed
a
ceremonious
meeting
of
two
ladies
of
quality
the
gentlemen
also
bowed
profoundly
pressing
their
hats
against
their
hearts
mistress
stagg
to
whom
her
protégée
aversion
to
company
was
no
light
cross
twitched
her
mirabell
by
the
sleeve
and
hanging
upon
his
arm
prevented
his
further
advance
the
action
said
let
the
child
alone
maybe
when
the
ice
is
once
broken
she
see
people
and
not
be
so
shy
and
strange
lee
said
evelyn
sweetly
i
have
dropped
my
glove
perhaps
in
the
on
the
terrace
if
you
will
be
so
good
grymes
will
you
desire
stagg
yonder
to
shortly
visit
me
at
my
lodging
i
wish
to
bespeak
a
play
and
would
confer
with
him
on
the
matter
the
gentlemen
bowed
and
hasted
upon
their
several
errands
leaving
audrey
and
evelyn
standing
face
to
face
in
the
sunny
path
you
are
well
i
hope
said
the
latter
in
her
low
clear
voice
and
happy
i
am
well
mistress
evelyn
answered
audrey
i
think
that
i
am
not
unhappy
the
other
gazed
at
her
in
silence
then
we
have
all
been
blind
she
said
is
not
a
year
since
may
day
and
the
jaquelins
merrymaking
it
seems
much
longer
you
won
the
race
do
you
remember
and
took
the
prize
from
my
hand
and
neither
of
us
thought
of
all
that
should
follow
did
we
or
guessed
at
other
days
i
saw
you
last
night
at
the
theatre
and
you
made
my
heart
like
to
burst
for
pity
and
sorrow
you
were
only
playing
at
woe
you
are
not
unhappy
not
like
that
audrey
shook
her
head
no
not
like
that
there
was
a
pause
broken
by
evelyn
haward
is
in
town
she
said
in
a
low
but
unfaltering
voice
he
was
at
the
playhouse
last
night
i
watched
him
sitting
in
a
box
in
the
shadow
you
also
saw
him
yes
said
audrey
he
had
not
been
there
for
a
long
long
time
at
first
he
came
night
after
night
i
wrote
to
him
at
last
and
told
him
how
he
troubled
me
made
me
forget
my
lines
and
then
he
came
no
more
there
was
in
her
tone
a
strange
wistfulness
evelyn
drew
her
breath
sharply
glanced
swiftly
at
the
dark
face
and
liquid
eyes
grymes
yet
held
the
manager
and
his
wife
in
conversation
but
lee
a
small
glove
in
hand
was
hurrying
toward
them
from
the
you
think
that
you
do
not
love
mr
haward
said
evelyn
in
a
low
voice
i
loved
one
that
never
lived
said
audrey
simply
it
was
all
in
a
dream
from
which
i
have
waked
i
told
him
that
at
westover
and
afterwards
here
in
williamsburgh
i
grew
so
tired
at
last
it
hurt
me
so
to
tell
him
and
then
i
wrote
the
letter
he
has
been
at
fair
view
this
long
time
has
he
not
yes
said
evelyn
quietly
he
has
been
alone
at
fair
view
the
rose
in
her
cheeks
had
faded
she
put
her
lace
handkerchief
to
her
lips
and
shut
her
hand
so
closely
that
the
nails
bit
into
the
palm
in
a
moment
however
she
was
smiling
a
faint
inscrutable
smile
and
presently
she
came
a
little
nearer
and
took
audrey
hand
in
her
own
the
soft
hot
lingering
touch
thrilled
the
girl
she
began
to
speak
hurriedly
not
knowing
why
she
spoke
nor
what
she
wished
to
say
mistress
evelyn
yes
audrey
said
evelyn
and
laid
a
fluttering
touch
upon
the
lips
then
in
a
moment
spoke
herself
you
are
to
remember
always
though
you
love
him
not
audrey
that
he
never
was
true
lover
of
mine
that
now
and
forever
and
though
you
died
he
is
to
me
but
an
old
acquaintance
marmaduke
haward
of
fair
view
remember
also
that
it
was
not
your
fault
nor
his
perhaps
nor
mine
and
that
with
all
my
heart
i
wish
his
happiness
ah
lee
you
found
it
my
thanks
sir
lee
having
restored
the
glove
with
all
the
pretty
froth
of
words
which
the
occasion
merited
and
seen
mistress
evelyn
turn
aside
to
speak
with
stagg
found
himself
mightily
inclined
to
improve
the
golden
opportunity
and
at
once
lay
siege
to
this
paragon
from
the
playhouse
two
low
bows
a
compliment
a
quotation
from
his
to
sylvia
upon
her
leaving
the
theatre
and
the
young
gentleman
thought
his
lines
well
laid
but
sylvia
grew
restless
dealt
in
monosyllables
and
finally
retreated
to
mistress
stagg
side
shall
we
not
go
home
she
whispered
i
i
am
tired
and
i
have
my
part
to
study
the
long
speech
at
the
end
that
i
stumbled
in
last
night
ah
let
us
go
mistress
stagg
sighed
over
the
girl
contumacy
it
was
not
thus
in
bath
when
she
was
young
and
men
of
fashion
flocked
to
compliment
a
handsome
player
now
there
was
naught
to
do
but
to
let
the
child
have
her
way
she
and
audrey
made
their
curtsies
and
charles
stagg
his
bow
which
was
modeled
after
that
of
beau
nash
then
the
three
went
down
the
sunny
path
to
the
palace
gates
and
evelyn
with
the
two
gentlemen
moved
toward
the
house
and
the
company
within
chapter
xxix
amor
vincit
by
now
it
was
early
spring
in
virginia
and
a
time
of
balm
and
pleasantness
the
season
had
not
entered
into
its
complete
heritage
of
gay
hues
sweet
odors
song
and
wealth
of
bliss
its
birthday
robe
was
yet
its
coronal
of
blossoms
yet
folded
buds
its
choristers
not
ready
with
their
fullest
pæans
but
everywhere
was
earnest
of
future
riches
in
the
forest
the
bloodroot
was
in
flower
and
the
bluebird
and
the
redbird
flashed
from
the
maple
that
was
touched
with
fire
to
the
beech
just
lifted
from
a
pale
green
fountain
in
mistress
stagg
garden
daffodils
bloomed
and
dim
blue
hyacinths
made
sweet
places
in
the
grass
the
sun
lay
warm
upon
upturned
earth
blackbirds
rose
in
squadrons
and
darkened
the
yet
leafless
trees
and
every
wind
brought
rumors
of
the
heyday
toward
which
the
earth
was
spinning
the
days
were
long
and
sweet
at
night
a
moon
came
up
and
between
it
and
the
earth
played
soft
and
vernal
airs
then
a
pale
light
flooded
the
garden
the
shells
bordering
its
paths
gleamed
like
threaded
pearls
and
the
house
showed
whiter
than
a
marble
sepulchre
mild
incense
cool
winds
were
there
but
quiet
came
fitfully
between
the
bursts
of
noise
from
the
lit
theatre
on
such
a
night
as
this
audrey
clothed
in
red
silk
with
a
band
of
false
jewels
about
her
shadowy
hair
slipped
through
the
stage
door
into
the
garden
and
moved
across
it
to
the
small
white
house
and
rest
her
part
in
the
play
was
done
for
all
their
storming
she
would
not
stay
silence
and
herself
alone
and
the
mirror
in
her
room
then
sitting
before
the
glass
to
see
in
it
darkly
the
woman
whom
she
had
left
dead
upon
the
boards
yonder
no
not
yonder
but
in
a
far
country
and
a
fair
and
great
city
love
love
and
death
for
love
and
her
own
face
in
the
mirror
gazing
at
her
with
eyes
of
that
greek
it
was
the
exaltation
and
the
dream
mournful
yet
not
without
its
luxury
that
ended
her
every
day
when
the
candle
burned
low
when
the
face
looked
but
dimly
from
the
glass
then
would
she
rise
and
quench
the
flame
and
lay
herself
down
to
sleep
with
the
moonlight
upon
her
crossed
hands
and
quiet
brow
she
passed
through
the
grape
arbor
and
opened
the
door
at
which
haward
had
knocked
that
september
night
of
the
governor
ball
she
was
in
mistress
stagg
long
room
at
that
hour
it
should
have
been
lit
only
by
a
dying
fire
and
a
solitary
candle
now
the
fire
was
low
enough
but
the
room
seemed
aflare
with
myrtle
tapers
audrey
coming
from
the
dimness
without
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
hand
the
heavy
door
shut
to
behind
her
unseeing
still
she
moved
toward
the
fire
but
in
a
moment
let
fall
her
hand
and
began
to
wonder
at
the
unwonted
lights
mistress
stagg
was
yet
in
the
playhouse
who
then
had
lit
these
candles
she
turned
and
saw
haward
standing
with
folded
arms
between
her
and
the
door
the
silence
was
long
he
was
marmaduke
haward
with
all
his
powers
gathered
calm
determined
so
desperate
to
have
done
with
this
thing
to
at
once
and
forever
gain
his
own
and
master
fate
that
his
stillness
was
that
of
deepest
waters
his
cool
equanimity
that
of
the
gamester
who
knows
how
will
fall
the
loaded
dice
dressed
with
his
accustomed
care
very
pale
composed
and
quiet
he
faced
her
whose
spirit
yet
lingered
in
a
far
city
who
in
the
dreamy
exaltation
of
this
midnight
hour
was
ever
half
audrey
of
the
garden
half
that
other
woman
in
a
dress
of
red
silk
with
jewels
in
her
hair
who
love
martyr
had
exulted
given
all
and
died
how
did
you
come
here
she
breathed
at
last
you
said
that
you
would
come
never
again
after
never
again
he
answered
but
now
audrey
this
once
again
this
once
again
gazing
past
him
she
made
a
movement
toward
the
door
he
shook
his
head
this
is
my
hour
audrey
you
may
not
leave
the
room
nor
will
mistress
stagg
enter
it
i
will
not
touch
you
i
will
come
no
nearer
to
you
stand
there
in
silence
if
you
choose
or
cover
the
sight
of
me
from
your
eyes
while
for
my
own
ease
my
own
unhappiness
i
say
farewell
farewell
she
echoed
long
ago
at
westover
that
was
said
between
you
and
me
why
do
you
come
like
a
ghost
to
keep
me
and
peace
apart
he
did
not
answer
and
she
locked
her
hands
across
her
brow
that
burned
beneath
the
heavy
circlet
of
mock
gems
is
it
kind
she
demanded
with
a
sob
in
her
voice
is
it
kind
to
trouble
me
so
to
keep
me
here
was
i
ever
kind
he
asked
since
the
night
when
i
followed
you
a
child
and
caught
you
from
the
ground
when
you
fell
between
the
corn
rows
what
kindness
audrey
none
she
answered
with
sudden
passion
nor
kindness
then
why
went
you
not
some
other
way
shall
i
tell
you
why
i
was
there
that
night
why
i
left
my
companions
and
came
riding
back
to
the
cabin
in
the
valley
she
uncovered
her
eyes
i
thought
i
thought
then
that
you
were
sent
he
looked
at
her
with
strange
compassion
my
own
will
sent
me
when
that
sunny
afternoon
we
spurred
from
the
valley
toward
the
higher
mountains
we
left
behind
us
a
forest
flower
a
young
girl
of
simple
sweetness
with
long
dark
hair
like
yours
audrey
it
was
to
pluck
that
flower
that
i
deserted
the
expedition
that
i
went
back
to
the
valley
between
the
hills
her
eyes
dilated
and
her
hands
very
slowly
rose
to
press
her
temples
to
make
a
shadow
from
which
she
might
face
the
cup
of
trembling
he
was
pouring
for
her
she
said
beneath
her
breath
he
nodded
well
death
had
gathered
the
flower
accident
threw
across
my
path
a
tinier
blossom
a
helpless
child
save
you
then
care
for
you
then
i
must
or
i
had
been
not
man
but
monster
did
i
care
for
you
tenderly
audrey
did
i
make
you
love
me
with
all
your
childish
heart
did
i
become
to
you
father
and
mother
and
sister
and
fairy
prince
then
what
were
you
to
me
in
those
old
days
a
child
fanciful
and
charming
too
fine
in
all
her
moods
not
to
breed
wonder
to
give
the
feeling
that
nature
had
placed
in
that
mountain
cabin
a
changeling
of
her
own
a
child
that
one
must
regard
with
fondness
and
some
pity
what
is
called
a
dear
child
moreover
a
child
whose
life
i
had
saved
and
to
whom
it
pleased
me
to
play
providence
i
was
young
not
hard
of
heart
sedulous
to
fold
back
to
the
uttermost
the
roseleaves
of
every
delicate
and
poetic
emotion
magnificently
generous
also
and
set
to
play
my
life
grand
to
myself
assume
a
responsibility
which
with
all
ease
might
have
been
transferred
to
an
orphan
court
to
put
my
stamp
upon
your
life
to
come
to
watch
you
kneel
and
drink
of
my
fountain
of
generosity
to
open
my
hand
and
with
an
indulgent
smile
shower
down
upon
you
the
coin
of
pleasure
and
advantage
why
what
a
tribute
was
this
to
my
own
sovereignty
what
subtle
flattery
of
what
delicate
taste
of
power
well
i
kissed
you
and
unclasped
your
hands
from
my
neck
chided
you
laughed
at
you
fondled
you
promised
all
manner
of
pretty
things
and
engaged
you
never
to
forget
me
and
sailed
away
upon
the
golden
rose
to
meet
my
crowded
years
with
their
wine
and
roses
upas
shadows
and
apples
of
sodom
how
long
before
i
forgot
you
audrey
a
year
and
a
day
perhaps
i
protest
that
i
can
not
remember
exactly
he
slightly
changed
his
position
but
came
no
nearer
to
her
it
was
growing
quiet
in
the
street
beyond
the
curtained
windows
one
window
was
bare
but
it
gave
only
upon
an
unused
nook
of
the
garden
where
were
merely
the
moonlight
and
some
tall
leafless
bushes
i
came
back
to
virginia
he
said
and
i
looked
for
and
found
you
in
the
heart
of
a
flowering
wood
all
that
you
imagined
me
to
be
audrey
that
was
i
not
paladin
king
among
men
what
irony
child
in
that
strange
dream
and
infatuation
of
thine
i
was
i
am
of
my
time
and
of
myself
and
he
whom
that
day
you
thought
me
had
not
then
nor
afterwards
form
or
being
i
wish
you
to
be
perfect
in
this
lesson
audrey
are
you
so
yes
she
sighed
her
hands
had
fallen
she
was
looking
at
him
with
slowly
parting
lips
and
a
strange
expression
in
her
eyes
he
went
on
quietly
as
before
every
feature
controlled
to
impassivity
and
his
arms
lightly
folded
that
is
well
between
the
day
when
i
found
you
again
and
a
night
in
the
palace
yonder
lies
a
summer
a
summer
to
me
all
the
summers
that
ever
i
had
or
will
have
ten
thousand
summers
now
tell
me
how
i
did
in
this
wonderful
summer
ignobly
she
answered
he
bowed
his
head
gravely
ay
audrey
it
is
a
good
word
with
a
quick
sigh
he
left
his
place
and
walking
to
the
uncurtained
window
stood
there
looking
out
upon
the
strip
of
moonlight
and
the
screen
of
bushes
but
when
he
turned
again
to
the
room
his
face
and
bearing
were
as
impressive
as
before
in
their
fine
still
gravity
their
repose
of
determination
and
that
evening
by
the
river
when
you
fled
from
me
to
hugon
i
had
awaked
she
said
in
a
low
voice
you
were
to
me
a
stranger
and
i
feared
you
and
at
westover
a
stranger
here
in
williamsburgh
when
by
dint
of
much
striving
i
saw
you
when
i
wrote
to
you
when
at
last
you
sent
me
that
letter
that
piteous
and
cruel
letter
audrey
for
one
moment
her
dark
eyes
met
his
then
fell
to
her
clasped
hands
a
stranger
she
said
the
letter
was
many
weeks
ago
i
have
been
alone
with
my
thoughts
at
fair
view
and
audrey
a
stranger
she
would
have
answered
but
her
voice
broke
there
were
shadows
under
her
eyes
her
lifted
face
had
in
it
a
strained
intent
expectancy
as
though
she
saw
or
heard
one
coming
a
stranger
he
acquiesced
a
foreigner
in
your
world
of
dreams
and
shadows
no
prince
audrey
or
great
white
knight
and
hero
only
a
gentleman
of
these
latter
days
compact
like
his
fellows
of
strength
and
weakness
now
very
wise
and
now
the
mere
of
folly
set
to
travel
his
own
path
able
to
hear
above
him
in
the
rarer
air
the
trumpet
call
but
choosing
to
loiter
on
the
lower
slopes
in
addition
a
man
who
loves
at
last
loves
greatly
with
a
passion
that
shall
ennoble
a
stranger
and
your
lover
audrey
come
to
say
farewell
her
voice
came
like
an
echo
plaintive
and
clear
and
from
far
away
farewell
how
steadily
do
i
stand
here
to
say
farewell
he
said
yet
i
am
eaten
of
my
passion
a
fire
burns
me
a
voice
within
me
ever
cries
aloud
i
am
whirled
in
a
resistless
wind
ah
my
love
the
garden
at
fair
view
the
folded
rose
that
will
never
bloom
the
dial
where
linger
the
heavy
hours
the
heavy
heavy
heavy
hours
the
garden
she
whispered
i
smell
the
box
the
path
was
all
in
sunshine
so
quiet
so
hushed
i
went
a
little
farther
and
i
heard
your
voice
where
you
sat
and
read
and
read
of
eloïsa
evelyn
evelyn
the
last
time
the
last
farewell
he
said
when
the
golden
rose
is
far
at
sea
when
the
winds
blow
when
the
stars
drift
below
the
verge
when
the
sea
speaks
then
may
i
forget
you
may
the
vision
of
you
pass
now
at
fair
view
it
passes
not
it
dwells
night
and
day
i
behold
you
the
woman
that
i
love
the
woman
that
i
love
in
vain
the
golden
rose
she
answered
the
sea
alas
her
voice
had
risen
into
a
cry
the
walls
of
the
room
were
gone
the
air
pressed
upon
her
heavily
the
lights
wavered
the
waters
were
passing
over
her
as
they
had
passed
that
night
of
the
witch
hut
how
far
away
the
bank
upon
which
he
stood
he
spoke
to
her
and
his
voice
came
faintly
as
from
that
distant
shore
or
from
the
deck
of
a
swiftly
passing
ship
and
so
it
is
sweetheart
for
why
should
i
stay
in
virginia
ah
if
you
loved
me
audrey
but
since
it
is
not
so
this
time
i
not
forget
you
but
i
will
not
come
again
her
lips
moved
but
there
came
no
words
a
light
had
dawned
upon
her
face
her
hand
was
lifted
as
though
to
stay
a
sound
of
music
suddenly
she
turned
toward
him
swayed
and
would
have
fallen
but
that
his
arm
caught
and
upheld
her
her
head
was
thrown
back
the
soft
masses
of
her
wonderful
hair
brushed
his
cheek
and
shoulder
her
eyes
looked
past
him
and
a
smile
pure
and
exquisite
past
expression
just
redeemed
her
face
from
sadness
love
she
said
clearly
and
sweetly
at
the
sound
of
her
own
words
came
to
her
the
full
realization
and
understanding
of
herself
with
a
cry
she
freed
herself
from
his
supporting
arm
stepped
backward
and
looked
at
him
the
color
surged
over
her
face
and
throat
her
eyelids
drooped
while
her
name
was
yet
upon
his
lips
she
answered
with
a
broken
cry
of
ecstasy
and
abandonment
a
moment
and
she
was
in
his
arms
and
their
lips
had
met
how
quiet
it
was
in
the
long
room
where
the
myrtle
candles
gave
out
their
faint
perfume
and
the
low
fire
leaped
upon
the
hearth
thus
for
a
time
then
growing
faint
with
her
happiness
she
put
up
protesting
hands
he
made
her
sit
in
the
great
chair
and
knelt
before
her
all
youth
and
fire
handsome
ardent
transfigured
by
his
passion
into
such
a
lover
as
a
queen
might
desire
hail
sultana
he
said
smiling
his
eyes
upon
her
diadem
now
you
are
arpasia
again
and
i
am
moneses
and
ready
ah
most
ready
to
die
for
you
she
also
smiled
remember
that
i
am
to
quickly
follow
you
when
shall
we
marry
he
demanded
the
garden
cries
out
for
you
my
love
and
i
wish
to
hear
your
footstep
in
my
house
it
hath
been
a
dreary
house
filled
with
shadows
haunted
by
keen
longings
and
vain
regrets
now
the
windows
shall
be
flung
wide
and
the
sunshine
shall
pour
in
oh
your
voice
singing
through
the
rooms
your
foot
upon
the
stairs
he
took
her
hands
and
put
them
to
his
lips
i
love
as
men
loved
of
old
he
said
i
am
far
from
myself
and
my
times
when
will
you
become
my
wife
she
answered
him
simply
like
the
child
that
at
times
she
seemed
when
you
will
but
i
must
be
arpasia
again
night
the
governor
hath
ordered
the
play
repeated
and
margery
linn
could
not
learn
my
part
in
time
he
laughed
fingering
the
red
silk
of
her
hanging
sleeve
feasting
his
eyes
upon
her
dark
beauty
so
heightened
and
deepened
in
the
year
that
had
passed
then
play
to
them
and
to
me
who
shall
watch
you
well
night
but
after
that
to
them
never
again
only
to
me
audrey
to
me
when
we
walk
in
the
garden
at
home
when
we
sit
in
the
and
the
candles
are
lighted
that
day
in
may
when
first
you
came
into
my
garden
when
first
i
showed
you
my
house
when
first
i
rowed
you
home
with
the
sunshine
on
the
water
and
the
roses
in
your
hair
love
love
do
you
remember
remember
she
answered
in
a
thrilling
voice
when
i
am
dead
i
shall
yet
remember
and
i
will
come
when
you
want
me
after
night
i
will
come
oh
can
not
you
hear
the
river
and
the
walls
of
the
box
will
be
freshly
green
and
the
all
in
bloom
the
white
leaves
drift
down
upon
the
bench
beneath
the
i
will
sit
in
the
grass
at
your
feet
oh
i
love
you
have
loved
you
long
they
had
risen
and
now
with
her
head
upon
his
breast
and
his
arm
about
her
they
stood
in
the
heart
of
the
soft
radiance
of
many
candles
his
face
was
bowed
upon
the
dark
wonder
of
her
hair
when
at
last
he
lifted
his
eyes
they
chanced
to
fall
upon
the
one
uncurtained
window
audrey
feeling
his
slight
quickly
controlled
start
turned
within
his
arm
and
also
saw
the
face
of
jean
hugon
pressed
against
the
glass
staring
in
upon
them
before
haward
could
reach
the
window
the
face
was
gone
a
strip
of
moonlight
some
leafless
bashes
beyond
the
blank
wall
of
the
theatre
that
was
all
raising
the
sash
haward
leaned
forth
until
he
could
see
the
garden
at
large
moonlight
still
and
cold
winding
paths
and
shadows
of
tree
and
shrub
and
vine
but
no
sign
of
living
creature
he
closed
the
window
and
drew
the
curtain
across
then
turned
again
to
audrey
a
phantom
of
the
night
he
said
and
laughed
she
was
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
room
with
her
red
dress
gleaming
in
the
candlelight
her
brow
beneath
its
mock
crown
had
no
lines
of
care
and
her
wonderful
eyes
smiled
upon
him
i
have
no
fear
of
it
she
answered
that
is
strange
is
it
not
when
i
have
feared
it
for
so
long
i
have
no
other
fear
than
that
i
shall

a

the
last
act
before
eight
of
the
clock
stagg
peering
from
behind
the
curtain
noted
with
satisfaction
that
the
house
was
filling
rapidly
upon
the
stroke
of
the
hour
it
was
crowded
to
the
door
without
which
might
be
heard
angry
voices
contending
that
there
must
be
yet
places
for
the
buying
the
musicians
began
to
play
and
more
candles
were
lighted
there
were
laughter
talk
greetings
from
one
part
of
the
house
to
another
as
much
movement
to
and
fro
as
could
be
accomplished
in
so
crowded
a
space
the
manners
of
the
london
playhouses
were
aped
not
unsuccessfully
to
compare
small
things
with
great
it

have
been

lane
upon
a
gala
night
if
the
building
was
rude
yet
it
had
no
rival
in
the
colonies
and
if
the
audience
was
not
so
gay
of
hue
impertinent
of
tongue
or
paramount
in
fashion
as
its
london
counterpart
yet
it
was
composed
of
the
rulers
and
makers
of

to
greatness

sat
his

arrived
in

from

that
day
with

set
upon

while
seated

standing
in
the
pit
or
mingling
with
the
ladies
who
made
gay
the
boxes
were
other
gentlemen
of
consequence
councilors
burgesses
owners
of
vast
tracts
of
land
of
ships
and
many
slaves
of
their
number
some
were
traveled
men
and
some
had
fought
in
england
wars
and
some
had
studied
in
her
universities
many
were
of
gentle
blood
sprung
from
worthy
and
venerable
houses
in
that
green
island
which
with
fondness
they
still
called
home
and
many
had
made
for
themselves
name
and
fortune
hewing
their
way
to
honor
through
a
primeval
forest
of
adversities
lesser
personages
were
not
lacking
but
crowded
the
gallery
and
invaded
the
pit
old
fighters
of
indians
were
present
and
masters
of
ships
trading
from
the
spanish
islands
or
from
the
ports
of

rude
lumbermen
from
norfolk
or
the
borders
of
the
dismal
swamp
stared
about
them
while
here
and
there
showed
the
coat
of
a

or
the

face
of

as

the

everywhere
the
vividness
and
animation
of
a
strangely
compounded
society
where
the

were
deep
and
the
lights
were
high
nor
did
the
conversation
of
so
motley
an
assemblage
lack
a
certain
pictorial
quality
a
somewhat
fantastic
opulence
of
reference
and
allusion
of
what
might
its
members
speak
while
they
waited
for
the
drawing
aside
of
the
piece
of
baize
which
hung
between
them
and
an
oriental
camp
there
was
the
staple
of
their
wealth
a
plant
the
smoke
of
whose
burning
might
have
wrapped
its
native
fields
in
a
perpetual
haze
as
of
indian
summer
and
there
was
the
warfare
bequeathed
from
generation
to
generation
against
the
standing
armies
of
the
forest
that
subtle
foe
that
slept
not
retreated
not
whose
vanguard
ever
falling
ever
showed
unbroken
ranks
beyond
trapper
and
trader
and
ranger
might
tell
of
trails
through
the
wilderness
vast
and
hostile
of
canoes
upon
unknown
waters
of
beasts
of
prey
creatures
screaming
in
the
through
the
ebony
woods
of
indian
villages
also
and
of
red
men
who
in
the
fastnesses
that
were
left
them
took
and
tortured
and
slew
after
strange
fashions
the
white
man
strong
as
the
wind
drove
the
red
man
before
his
face
like
an
autumn
leaf
but
he
beckoned
to
the
black
man
and
the
black
man
came
at
his
call
he
came
in
numbers
from
a
far
country
and
the
manner
of
his
coming
was
in
chains
what
he
had
to
sell
was
valuable
but
the
purchase
price
came
not
into
his
hands
of
him
also
mention
was
made
the
master
of
the
tall
ship
that
had
brought
him
into
the
james
or
the
york
the
dealer
to
whom
he
was
consigned
the
officer
of
the
crown
who
had
cried
him
for
sale
the
planter
who
had
bought
him
the
divine
who
preached
that
he
was
of
a
race
accursed
all
were
there
and
all
had
interest
in
this
merchandise
others
in
the
throng
talked
of
ships
both
great
and
small
and
the
quaintness
of
their
names
the
golden
flowers
and
golden
women
the
swift
birds
and
beasts
the
namesakes
of
fortune
or
of
providence
came
pleasantly
upon
the
ear
the
bermoothes
barbadoes
and
all
the
indies
were
spoken
of
ports
to
the
north
and
ports
to
the
south
pirate
craft
and
sunken
treasure
a
flight
a
fight
a
chase
at
sea
the
men
from
norfolk
talked
of
the
great
dismal
and
its
trees
of
juniper
and
cypress
the
traders
of
trading
the
masters
from
william
and
mary
of
the
humanities
the
greater
men
authoritative
and
easy
owners
of
flesh
and
blood
and
much
land
holders
of
many
offices
and
leaders
of
the
people
paid
their
respects
to
and
cards
and
dice
to
building
planting
the
genteelest
mode
of
living
and
to
public
affairs
both
in
virginia
and
at
home
in
england
old
friends
with
oaths
of
hearty
affection
and
from
opposite
quarters
of
the
house
addressed
each
other
as
tom
or
ned
or
dick
while
old
enemies
finding
themselves
side
by
side
exchanged
extremely
civil
speeches
and
so
put
a
keener
edge
upon
their
mutual
disgust
in
the
boxes
where
glowed
the
women
there
was
comfit
talk
vastly
pretty
speeches
asseverations
denials
windy
sighs
the
politest
oaths
whispering
talk
of
the
play
and
last
but
not
least
of
haward
of
fair
view
and
darden
audrey
haward
entering
the
pit
made
his
way
quietly
to
where
a
servant
was
holding
for
him
a
place
the
fellow
pulled
his
forelock
in
response
to
his
master
nod
then
shouldered
his
way
through
the
press
to
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
upper
gallery
haward
standing
at
his
ease
looked
about
him
recognizing
this
or
that
acquaintance
with
his
slow
fine
smile
and
an
inclination
of
his
head
he
was
much
observed
and
presently
a
lady
leaned
from
her
box
smiled
waved
her
fan
and
slightly
beckoned
to
him
it
was
young
madam
byrd
and
evelyn
sat
beside
her
five
minutes
later
as
haward
entered
the
box
of
the
ladies
of
westover
music
sounded
the
curtain
was
drawn
back
and
the
play
began
upon
the
ruder
sort
in
the
audience
silence
fell
at
once
they
that
followed
the
sea
and
they
that
followed
the
woods
and
all
the
simple
folk
ceased
their
noise
and
gesticulation
and
gazed
spellbound
at
the
pomp
before
them
of
rude
scenery
and
indifferent
actors
but
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
talked
on
attending
to
their
own
business
in
the
face
of
tamerlane
and
his
victorious
force
it
was
the
fashion
to
do
so
and
in
the
play
the
first
act
counted
nothing
for
darden
audrey
had
naught
to
do
with
it
in
the
second
act
when
she
entered
as
arpasia
the
entire
house
would
fall
quiet
staring
and
holding
its
breath
haward
bent
over
madam
byrd
hand
then
as
that
lady
turned
from
him
to
greet
lee
addressed
himself
with
grave
courtesy
to
evelyn
clothed
in
pale
blue
and
more
lovely
even
than
her
wont
for
months
they
had
not
met
she
had
written
him
one
letter
had
written
the
night
of
the
day
upon
which
she
had
encountered
audrey
in
the
palace
walk
and
he
had
answered
it
with
a
broken
line
of
passionate
thanks
for
unmerited
kindness
now
as
he
bent
over
her
she
caught
his
wrist
lightly
with
her
hand
and
her
touch
burned
him
through
the
lace
of
his
ruffles
with
her
other
hand
she
spread
her
fan
lee
shoulder
knot
also
screened
them
while
grymes
had
engaged
its
owner
attention
and
pretty
madam
byrd
was
in
animated
conversation
with
the
occupants
of
a
neighboring
box
is
it
well
asked
evelyn
very
low
haward
answer
was
as
low
and
bravely
spoken
with
his
eyes
meeting
her
clear
gaze
and
her
touch
upon
his
wrist
for
me
evelyn
it
is
very
well
he
said
for
her
may
i
live
to
make
it
well
for
her
forever
and
a
day

for
her
she
is
to
be
my
wife
i
am
glad
said
evelyn
very
glad
you
are
a
noble
lady
he
answered
once
long
ago
i
styled
myself
your
friend
your
equal
now
i
know
better
my
place
and
yours
and
as
from
a
princess
i
take
your
alms
for
your
letter
that
letter
evelyn
which
told
me
what
you
thought
which
showed
me
what
to
do
i
humbly
thank
you
she
let
fall
her
hand
from
her
silken
lap
and
watched
with
unseeing
eyes
the
mimicry
of
life
upon
the
stage
before
them
where
selima
knelt
to
tamerlane
and
moneses
mourned
for
arpasia
presently
she
said
again
i
am
glad
and
then
when
they
had
kept
silence
for
a
while
you
will
live
at
fair
view
ay
he
replied
i
will
make
it
well
for
her
here
in
virginia

must
let
me
help
you
she
said
so
old
a
friend
as
i
may
claim
that
as
a
right
i
may
visit
her
may
i
not
now
we
must
look
at
the
players
when
she
enters
there
is
no
need
to
cry
for
silence
it
comes
of
itself
and
stays
we
watch
her
with
straining
eyes
who
is
that
man
in
a
cloak
staring
at
us
from
the
pit
see
with
the
great
peruke
and
the
scar
haward
bending
looked
over
the
rail
then
drew
back
with
a
smile
a
trader
he
said
by
name
jean
hugon
something
of
a
character
he
looked
strangely
at
us
said
evelyn
with
how
haggard
a
face
my
scarf
lee
thank
you
madam
have
you
the
right
of
the
matter
from
kitty
page
the
conversation
became
general
and
soon
the
act
approaching
its
end
and
other
gentlemen
pressing
into
the
box
which
held
so
beautiful
a
woman
so
great
a
catch
and
so
assured
a
belle
as
mistress
evelyn
byrd
haward
arose
and
took
his
leave
to
others
of
the
brilliant
company
assembled
in
the
playhouse
he
paid
his
respects
speaking
deferentially
to
the
governor
gayly
to
his
fellow
councilors
and
planters
and
bowing
low
to
many
ladies
all
this
was
in
the
interval
between
the
acts
at
the
second
parting
of
the
curtain
he
resumed
his
former
station
in
the
pit
with
intention
he
had
chosen
a
section
of
it
where
were
few
of
his
own
class
from
the
midst
of
the
ruder
sort
he
could
watch
her
more
freely
could
exult
at
his
ease
in
her
beauty
both
of
face
and
mind
the
curtains
parted
and
the
fiddlers
strove
for
warlike
music
tamerlane
surrounded
by
the
tartar
host
received
his
prisoners
and
the
defiant
rant
of
bajazet
shook
the
rafters
all
the
sound
and
fury
of
the
stage
could
not
drown
the
noise
of
the
audience
idle
talk
and
laughter
loud
comment
upon
the
players
went
on
went
on
until
there
entered
audrey
dressed
in
red
silk
with
a
jeweled
circlet
like
a
line
of
flame
about
her
dark
flowing
hair
the
noise
sank
voices
of
men
and
women
died
away
for
a
moment
the
rustle
of
silk
the
flutter
of
fans
continued
then
this
also
ceased
she
stood
before
the
sultan
with
a
smile
of
scorn
upon
her
lips
then
spoke
in
a
voice
low
grave
monotonous
charged
like
a
passing
bell
with
warning
and
with
solemn
woe
the
house
seemed
to
grow
more
still
the
playgoers
box
and
pit
and
gallery
leaned
slightly
forward
whether
she
spoke
or
moved
or
stood
in
silence
darden
audrey
that
had
been
a
thing
of
naught
now
held
every
eye
was
regnant
for
an
hour
in
this
epitome
of
the
world
the
scene
went
on
and
now
it
was
to
moneses
that
she
spoke
all
the
bliss
and
anguish
of
unhappy
love
sounded
in
her
voice
dwelt
in
her
eye
and
most
exquisite
smile
hung
upon
her
every
gesture
the
curtains
closed
from
the
throng
that
had
watched
her
came
a
sound
like
a
sigh
after
which
slowly
tongues
were
loosened
an
interval
of
impatient
waiting
then
the
music
again
and
the
parting
curtains
and
darden
audrey
the
girl
who
could
so
paint
very
love
very
sorrow
very
death
the
girl
who
had
come
strangely
and
by
a
devious
path
from
the
height
and
loneliness
of
the
mountains
to
the
level
of
this
stage
and
the
watching
throng
at
the
close
of
the
fourth
act
of
the
play
haward
left
his
station
in
the
pit
and
quietly
made
his
way
to
the
regions
behind
the
curtain
where
in
the
very
circumscribed
space
that
served
as
greenroom
to
the
williamsburgh
theatre
he
found
tamerlane
bajazet
and
their
satellites
together
with
a
number
of
gentlemen
invaders
from
the
front
of
the
house
mistress
stagg
was
there
and
selima
perched
upon
a
table
was
laughing
with
the
aforesaid
gentlemen
but
no
arpasia
haward
drew
the
elder
woman
aside
i
wish
to
see
her
he
said
in
a
low
voice
kindly
but
imperious
a
moment
only
good
woman
with
her
finger
at
her
lips
mistress
stagg
glanced
about
her
she
hides
from
them
always
she
that
strange
a
child
though
indeed
sir
as
sweet
a
young
lady
as
a
prince
might
wed
this
way
sir
it
dark
make
no
noise
she
led
him
through
a
dim
passageway
and
softly
opened
a
door
there
sir
for
just
five
minutes
i
call
her
in
time
the
door
gave
upon
the
garden
and
audrey
sat
upon
the
step
in
the
moonshine
and
the
stillness
her
hand
propped
her
chin
and
her
eyes
were
raised
to
the
few
silver
stars
that
mock
crown
which
she
wore
sparkled
palely
and
the
light
lay
in
the
folds
of
her
silken
dress
at
the
opening
of
the
door
she
did
not
turn
thinking
that
mistress
stagg
stood
behind
her
how
bright
the
moon
shines
she
said
a
mockingbird
should
be
singing
singing
is
it
time
for
arpasia
as
she
rose
from
the
step
haward
caught
her
in
his
arms
it
is
i
my
love
ah
heart
desire
i
worship
you
who
gleam
in
the
moonlight
with
your
crown
like
an
aureole
audrey
rested
against
him
clasping
her
hands
upon
his
shoulder
there
were
nights
like
this
she
said
dreamily
if
i
were
a
little
child
again
you
could
lift
me
in
your
arms
and
carry
me
home
i
am
tired
i
would
that
i
needed
not
to
go
back
to
the
glare
and
noise
the
moon
shines
so
bright
i
have
been
thinking
he
bent
his
head
and
kissed
her
twice
poor
arpasia
poor
tired
child
soon
we
shall
go
home
audrey
we
two
my
love
we
two
i
have
been
thinking
sitting
here
in
the
moonlight
she
went
on
her
hands
clasped
upon
his
shoulder
and
her
cheek
resting
on
them
i
was
so
ignorant
i
never
dreamed
that
i
could
wrong
her
and
when
i
awoke
it
was
too
late
and
now
i
love
you
not
the
dream
but
you
i
know
not
what
is
right
or
wrong
i
know
only
that
i
love
i
think
she
understands
forgives
i
love
you
so
her
hands
parted
and
she
stood
from
him
with
her
face
raised
to
the
balm
of
the
night
i
love
you
so
she
repeated
and
the
low
cadence
of
her
laugh
broke
the
silver
stillness
of
the
garden
the
moon
up
there
she
knows
it
and
the
stars
not
one
has
fallen
smell
the
flowers
wait
i
will
pluck
you
hyacinths
they
grew
by
the
doorstep
and
she
broke
the
slender
stalks
and
gave
them
into
his
hand
but
when
he
had
kissed
them
he
would
give
them
back
would
fasten
them
himself
in
the
folds
of
silk
that
rose
and
fell
with
her
quickened
breathing
he
fastened
them
with
a
brooch
which
he
took
from
the
mechlin
at
his
throat
it
was
the
golden
horseshoe
the
token
that
he
had
journeyed
to
the
endless
mountains
now
i
must
go
said
audrey
they
are
calling
for
arpasia
follow
me
not
at
once
ah
i
love
you
so
remember
always
that
i
love
you
so
she
was
gone
in
a
few
minutes
he
also
reëntered
the
playhouse
and
went
to
his
former
place
where
with
none
of
his
kind
about
him
he
might
watch
her
undisturbed
as
he
made
his
way
with
some
difficulty
through
the
throng
he
was
aware
that
he
brushed
against
a
man
in
a
great
peruke
who
despite
the
heat
of
the
house
was
wrapped
in
an
old
roquelaure
tawdrily
laced
also
that
the
man
was
keeping
stealthy
pace
with
him
and
that
when
he
at
last
reached
his
station
the
cloaked
figure
fell
into
place
immediately
behind
him
haward
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
would
not
turn
his
head
and
thereby
grant
recognition
to
jean
hugon
the
trader
did
he
so
the
might
break
into
speech
provoke
a
quarrel
make
god
knew
what
assertion
what
disturbance
steps
should
be
taken
ah
the
curtain
the
silence
deepened
and
men
and
women
leaned
forward
holding
their
breath
darden
audrey
robed
and
crowned
as
arpasia
sat
alone
in
the
sultan
tent
staring
before
her
with
wide
dark
eyes
then
slowly
rising
began
to
speak
a
sound
a
sigh
as
of
wonder
ran
from
the
one
to
the
other
of
the
throng
that
watched
her
why
did
she
look
thus
with
contracted
brows
toward
one
quarter
of
the
house
what
inarticulate
words
was
she
uttering
what
gesture
quickly
controlled
did
she
make
of
ghastly
fear
and
warning
and
now
the
familiar
words
came
halting
from
her
lips
is
a
horror
more
than
darkness
brings
that
sits
upon
the
night
with
the
closing
words
of
her
speech
the
audience
burst
into
a
great
storm
of
applause
how
she
acts
but
what
now
why
what
is
this
it
was
quite
in
nature
and
the
mode
for
an
actress
to
pause
in
the
middle
of
a
scene
to
curtsy
thanks
for
generous
applause
to
smile
and
throw
a
mocking
kiss
to
pit
and
boxes
but
darden
audrey
had
hitherto
not
followed
the
fashion
also
it
was
not
uncustomary
for
some
spoiled
favorite
of
a
player
to
trip
down
between
her
scenes
the
step
or
two
from
the
stage
to
the
pit
and
mingle
with
the
gallants
there
laugh
jest
accept
languishing
glances
audacious
comparisons
and
such
weighty
trifles
as
gilt
snuffboxes
and
rings
of
price
but
this
player
had
not
heretofore
honored
the
custom
moreover
at
present
she
was
needed
upon
the
stage
bajazet
must
thunder
and
she
defy
without
her
the
play
could
not
move
and
indeed
the
actors
were
now
staring
with
the
audience
what
was
it
why
had
she
crossed
the
stage
and
slowly
smilingly
beautiful
and
stately
in
her
gleaming
robes
descended
those
few
steps
which
led
to
the
pit
what
had
she
to
do
there
throwing
smiling
glances
to
right
and
left
lightly
waving
the
folk
gentle
and
simple
from
her
path
pressing
steadily
onward
to
some
goal
as
though
held
by
a
spell
they
watched
her
one
and
all
haward
evelyn
the
governor
the
man
in
the
cloak
every
soul
in
that
motley
assemblage
the
wonder
had
not
time
to
dull
for
the
moments
were
few
between
her
final
of
those
boards
which
she
had
trodden
supreme
and
the
crashing
and
terrible
chord
which
was
to
close
the
entertainment
of
this
night
her
face
was
raised
to
the
boxes
and
it
seemed
as
though
her
dark
eyes
sought
one
there
then
suddenly
she
swerved
there
were
men
between
her
and
haward
she
raised
her
hand
and
they
fell
back
making
for
her
a
path
haward
bewildered
started
forward
but
her
cry
was
not
to
him
it
was
to
the
figure
just
behind
him
the
cloaked
figure
whose
hand
grasped
the
which
from
the
stage
as
she
had
looked
to
where
stood
her
lover
she
had
seen
or
divined
jean
jean
hugon
she
cried
involuntarily
the
trader
pushed
toward
her
past
the
man
whom
he
meant
to
stab
to
the
heart
the
action
dragging
his
cloak
aside
showed
the
arm
and
the
gleaming
steel
for
many
minutes
the
knife
had
been
ready
the
play
was
nearly
over
and
she
must
see
this
man
who
had
stolen
her
heart
this
haward
of
fair
view
die
else
jean
vengeance
were
not
complete
for
his
own
safety
the
maddened
had
ceased
to
care
no
warning
cried
from
the
stage
could
have
done
aught
but
precipitate
the
deed
but
now
for
the
moment
amazed
and
doubtful
he
turned
his
back
upon
his
prey
in
that
moment
the
audrey
of
the
woods
a
creature
lithe
and
agile
and
strong
of
wrist
as
of
will
had
thrown
herself
upon
him
clutching
the
hand
that
held
the
knife
he
strove
to
dash
her
from
him
but
in
vain
the
house
was
in
an
uproar
and
now
haward
hands
were
at
his
throat
haward
voice
was
crying
to
that
fair
devil
that
audrey
for
whom
he
had
built
his
house
who
was
balking
him
of
revenge
whose
body
was
between
him
and
his
enemy
suddenly
he
was
all
savage
as
upon
a
night
in
fair
view
house
he
had
cast
off
the
trammels
of
his
white
blood
so
now
an
access
of
furious
strength
came
to
him
he
shook
himself
free
the
knife
gleamed
in
the
air
descended
he
drew
it
from
the
bosom
into
which
he
had
plunged
it
and
as
haward
caught
her
in
his
arms
who
would
else
have
sunk
to
the
floor
the
burst
through
the
throng
brandishing
the
red
blade
and
loudly
speaking
in
the
tongue
of
the
monacans
like
a
whirlwind
he
was
gone
from
the
house
and
for
a
time
none
thought
to
follow
him
illustration
jean
jean
hugon
they
bore
her
into
the
small
white
house
and
up
the
stair
to
her
own
room
and
laid
her
upon
the
bed
contesse
came
and
went
away
and
came
again
there
was
a
crowd
in
palace
street
before
the
theatre
a
man
mounting
the
doorstep
so
that
he
might
be
heard
of
all
said
clearly
she
may
live
until
dawn
no
longer
later
one
came
out
of
the
house
and
asked
that
there
might
be
quiet
the
crowd
melted
away
but
throughout
the
mild
night
filled
with
the
soft
airs
and
thousand
odors
of
the
spring
people
stayed
about
the
place
standing
silent
in
the
street
or
sitting
on
the
garden
benches
in
the
room
upstairs
lay
darden
audrey
with
crossed
hands
and
head
put
slightly
back
she
lay
still
upon
the
edge
of
death
nor
seemed
to
care
that
it
was
so
her
eyes
were
closed
and
at
intervals
one
sitting
at
the
bed
head
laid
touch
upon
her
pulse
or
held
before
her
lips
a
slight
ringlet
of
her
hair
mary
stagg
sat
by
the
window
and
wept
but
haward
kneeling
hid
his
face
in
the
covering
of
the
bed
the
form
upon
it
was
not
more
still
than
he
mistress
stagg
also
stifled
her
sobs
for
it
seemed
not
a
place
for
loud
grief
in
the
room
below
amidst
the
tinsel
frippery
of
small
wares
waited
others
whose
lives
had
touched
the
life
that
was
ebbing
away
now
and
then
one
spoke
in
a
hushed
voice
a
window
was
raised
a
servant
bringing
in
fresh
candles
trod
too
heavily
then
the
quiet
closed
in
again
late
in
the
night
came
through
the
open
windows
a
distant
clamor
and
presently
a
man
ran
down
palace
street
and
as
he
ran
called
aloud
some
tidings
maclean
standing
near
the
door
went
softly
out
when
he
returned
colonel
byrd
sitting
at
the
table
lifted
inquiring
brows
they
took
him
in
the
reeds
near
the
capitol
landing
said
the
highlander
grimly
he
in
the
gaol
now
but
whether
the
people
will
leave
him
there
the
night
wore
on
grew
old
passed
into
the
cold
melancholy
of
its
latest
hour
darden
audrey
sighed
and
stirred
and
a
little
strength
coming
to
her
parting
spirit
she
opened
her
eyes
and
loosed
her
hands
the
physician
held
to
her
lips
the
cordial
and
she
drank
a
very
little
haward
lifted
his
head
and
as
contesse
passed
him
to
set
down
the
cup
caught
him
by
the
sleeve
the
other
looked
pityingly
at
the
man
into
whose
face
had
come
a
flush
of
hope
is
but
the
last
flickering
of
the
flame
he
said
soon
even
the
spark
will
vanish
audrey
began
to
speak
at
first
her
words
were
wild
and
wandering
but
the
mist
lifting
somewhat
she
presently
knew
mistress
stagg
and
liked
to
have
her
take
the
doctor
place
beside
her
at
haward
she
looked
doubtfully
with
wide
eyes
as
scarce
understanding
when
he
called
her
name
she
faintly
shook
her
head
then
turned
it
slightly
from
him
and
veiled
her
eyes
it
came
to
him
with
a
terrible
pang
that
the
memory
of
their
latest
meetings
was
wiped
from
her
brain
and
that
she
was
afraid
of
his
broken
words
and
the
tears
upon
her
hand
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
to
ask
for
the
minister
he
was
below
and
mistress
stagg
went
weeping
down
the
stairs
to
summon
him
he
came
but
would
not
touch
the
girl
only
stood
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
looked
down
upon
her
with
bleared
eyes
and
a
heavy
countenance
i
am
to
die
am
i
not
she
asked
with
her
gaze
upon
him
that
is
as
god
wills
audrey
he
answered
i
am
not
afraid
to
die
you
have
no
need
he
said
and
going
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
made
stagg
pour
for
him
a
glass
of
aqua
vitæ
audrey
closed
her
eyes
and
when
she
opened
them
again
there
seemed
to
be
many
persons
in
the
room
one
was
bending
over
her
whom
at
first
she
thought
was
molly
but
soon
she
saw
more
clearly
and
smiled
at
the
pale
and
sorrowful
face
the
lady
bent
lower
yet
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
audrey
she
said
and
audrey
looking
up
at
her
answered
evelyn
when
the
dawn
came
glimmering
in
the
windows
when
the
mist
was
cold
and
the
birds
were
faintly
heard
they
raised
her
upon
her
pillows
and
wiped
the
death
dew
from
her
forehead
audrey
audrey
audrey
cried
haward
and
caught
at
her
hands
she
looked
at
him
with
a
faint
and
doubtful
smile
remembering
nothing
of
that
hour
in
the
room
below
of
those
minutes
in
the
moonlit
garden
gather
the
rosebuds
while
ye
may
she
said
and
then
the
house
is
large
good
giant
eat
me
not
the
man
upon
his
knees
beside
her
uttered
a
cry
and
began
to
speak
to
her
thickly
rapidly
words
of
agony
entreaty
and
love
and
for
all
life
habit
would
resume
its
sway
and
lost
love
remorse
and
vain
regrets
put
on
a
mask
that
was
cold
and
fine
and
able
to
deceive
there
spoke
the
awakened
heart
with
her
hands
cold
in
his
with
his
agonized
gaze
upon
the
face
from
which
the
light
was
slowly
passing
he
poured
forth
his
passion
and
his
anguish
and
she
listened
not
they
moistened
her
lips
and
one
opened
wide
the
window
that
gave
upon
the
east
it
was
all
a
dream
she
said
and
again
all
a
dream
a
little
later
while
the
sky
flushed
slowly
and
the
light
of
the
candles
grew
pale
she
began
suddenly
and
in
a
stronger
voice
to
speak
as
arpasia
it
be
happiness
alas
to
die
to
lie
forgotten
in
the
silent
grave
forgotten
cried
haward
audrey
audrey
audrey
go
not
from
me
oh
love
love
stay
awhile
the
mountains
said
audrey
clearly
the
sun
upon
them
and
the
lifting
mist
the
mountains
he
cried
ay
we
will
go
to
them
audrey
we
will
go
together
why
you
are
stronger
sweetheart
there
is
strength
in
your
voice
and
your
hands
and
a
light
in
your
eyes
oh
if
you
will
live
audrey
i
will
make
you
happy
you
shall
take
me
to
the
mountains
we
will
go
together
you
and
i
audrey
audrey
but
audrey
was
gone
already
