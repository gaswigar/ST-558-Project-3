chapter
i
among
the
many
fatalities
attending
the
bloom
of
young
desire
that
of
blindly
taking
to
the
confectionery
line
has
not
perhaps
been
sufficiently
considered
how
is
the
son
of
a
british
yeoman
who
has
been
fed
principally
on
salt
pork
and
yeast
dumplings
to
know
that
there
is
satiety
for
the
human
stomach
even
in
a
paradise
of
glass
jars
full
of
sugared
almonds
and
pink
lozenges
and
that
the
tedium
of
life
can
reach
a
pitch
where
at
discretion
cease
to
offer
the
slightest
excitement
or
how
at
the
tender
age
when
a
confectioner
seems
to
him
a
very
prince
whom
all
the
world
must
envy
who
breakfasts
on
macaroons
dines
on
meringues
sups
on
and
fills
up
the
intermediate
hours
with
or
peppermint
how
is
he
to
foresee
the
day
of
sad
wisdom
when
he
will
discern
that
the
confectioner
calling
is
not
socially
influential
or
favourable
to
a
soaring
ambition
i
have
known
a
man
who
turned
out
to
have
a
metaphysical
genius
incautiously
in
the
period
of
youthful
buoyancy
commence
his
career
as
a
and
you
may
imagine
the
use
that
was
made
of
this
initial
mistake
by
opponents
who
felt
themselves
bound
to
warn
the
public
against
his
doctrine
of
the
inconceivable
he
could
not
give
up
his
because
he
made
his
bread
by
them
and
metaphysics
would
not
have
found
him
in
so
much
as
salt
to
his
bread
it
was
really
the
same
with
david
faux
and
the
confectionery
business
his
uncle
the
butler
at
the
great
house
close
by
brigford
had
made
a
pet
of
him
in
his
early
boyhood
and
it
was
on
a
visit
to
this
uncle
that
the
shops
in
that
brilliant
town
had
on
a
single
day
fired
his
tender
imagination
he
carried
home
the
pleasing
illusion
that
a
confectioner
must
be
at
once
the
happiest
and
the
foremost
of
men
since
the
things
he
made
were
not
only
the
most
beautiful
to
behold
but
the
very
best
eating
and
such
as
the
lord
mayor
must
always
order
largely
for
his
private
recreation
so
that
when
his
father
declared
he
must
be
put
to
a
trade
david
chose
his
line
without
a
moment
hesitation
and
with
a
rashness
inspired
by
a
sweet
tooth
wedded
himself
irrevocably
to
confectionery
soon
however
the
tooth
lost
its
relish
and
fell
into
blank
indifference
and
all
the
while
his
mind
expanded
his
ambition
took
new
shapes
which
could
hardly
be
satisfied
within
the
sphere
his
youthful
ardour
had
chosen
but
what
was
he
to
do
he
was
a
young
man
of
much
mental
activity
and
above
all
gifted
with
a
spirit
of
contrivance
but
then
his
faculties
would
not
tell
with
great
effect
in
any
other
medium
than
that
of
candied
sugars
conserves
and
pastry
say
what
you
will
about
the
identity
of
the
reasoning
process
in
all
branches
of
thought
or
about
the
advantage
of
coming
to
subjects
with
a
fresh
mind
the
adjustment
of
butter
to
flour
and
of
heat
to
pastry
is
the
best
preparation
for
the
office
of
prime
minister
besides
in
the
present
state
of
society
there
are
social
barriers
david
could
invent
delightful
things
in
the
way
of
and
he
had
the
widest
views
of
the
sugar
department
but
in
other
directions
he
certainly
felt
hampered
by
the
want
of
knowledge
and
practical
skill
and
the
world
is
so
inconveniently
constituted
that
the
vague
consciousness
of
being
a
fine
fellow
is
no
guarantee
of
success
in
any
line
of
business
this
difficulty
pressed
with
some
severity
on
david
faux
even
before
his
apprenticeship
was
ended
his
soul
swelled
with
an
impatient
sense
that
he
ought
to
become
something
very
remarkable
that
it
was
quite
out
of
the
question
for
him
to
put
up
with
a
narrow
lot
as
other
men
did
he
scorned
the
idea
that
he
could
accept
an
average
he
was
sure
there
was
nothing
average
about
him
even
such
a
person
as
tibbits
the
woman
perceived
it
and
probably
had
a
preference
for
his
linen
at
that
particular
period
he
was
weighing
out
gingerbread
nuts
but
such
an
anomaly
could
not
continue
no
position
could
be
suited
to
david
faux
that
was
not
in
the
highest
degree
easy
to
the
flesh
and
flattering
to
the
spirit
if
he
had
fallen
on
the
present
times
and
enjoyed
the
advantages
of
a
mechanic
institute
he
would
certainly
have
taken
to
literature
and
have
written
reviews
but
his
education
had
not
been
liberal
he
had
read
some
novels
from
the
adjoining
circulating
library
and
had
even
bought
the
story
of
and
which
had
made
him
feel
very
sorry
for
poor
inkle
so
that
his
ideas
might
not
have
been
below
a
certain
mark
of
the
literary
calling
but
his
spelling
and
diction
were
too
unconventional
when
a
man
is
not
adequately
appreciated
or
comfortably
placed
in
his
own
country
his
thoughts
naturally
turn
towards
foreign
climes
and
imagination
circled
round
and
round
the
utmost
limits
of
his
geographical
knowledge
in
search
of
a
country
where
a
young
gentleman
of
pasty
visage
lipless
mouth
and
stumpy
hair
would
be
likely
to
be
received
with
the
hospitable
enthusiasm
which
he
had
a
right
to
expect
having
a
general
idea
of
america
as
a
country
where
the
population
was
chiefly
black
it
appeared
to
him
the
most
propitious
destination
for
an
emigrant
who
to
begin
with
had
the
broad
and
easily
recognizable
merit
of
whiteness
and
this
idea
gradually
took
such
strong
possession
of
him
that
satan
seized
the
opportunity
of
suggesting
to
him
that
he
might
emigrate
under
easier
circumstances
if
he
supplied
himself
with
a
little
money
from
his
master
till
but
that
evil
spirit
whose
understanding
i
am
convinced
has
been
much
overrated
quite
wasted
his
time
on
this
occasion
david
would
certainly
have
liked
well
to
have
some
of
his
master
money
in
his
pocket
if
he
had
been
sure
his
master
would
have
been
the
only
man
to
suffer
for
it
but
he
was
a
cautious
youth
and
quite
determined
to
run
no
risks
on
his
own
account
so
he
stayed
out
his
apprenticeship
and
committed
no
act
of
dishonesty
that
was
at
all
likely
to
be
discovered
reserving
his
plan
of
emigration
for
a
future
opportunity
and
the
circumstances
under
which
he
carried
it
out
were
in
this
wise
having
been
at
home
a
week
or
two
partaking
of
the
family
beans
he
had
used
his
leisure
in
ascertaining
a
fact
which
was
of
considerable
importance
to
him
namely
that
his
mother
had
a
small
sum
in
guineas
painfully
saved
from
her
maiden
perquisites
and
kept
in
the
corner
of
a
drawer
where
her
had
reposed
for
the
last
twenty
years
ever
since
her
son
david
had
taken
to
his
feet
with
a
slight
promise
of
which
had
not
been
altogether
unfulfilled
faux
senior
had
told
his
son
very
frankly
that
he
must
not
look
to
being
set
up
in
business
by
with
seven
sons
and
one
of
them
a
very
healthy
and
idiot
who
consumed
a
dumpling
about
eight
inches
in
diameter
every
day
it
was
pretty
well
if
they
got
a
hundred
apiece
at
his
death
under
these
circumstances
what
was
david
to
do
it
was
certainly
hard
that
he
should
take
his
mother
money
but
he
saw
no
other
ready
means
of
getting
any
and
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
a
young
man
of
his
merit
should
put
up
with
inconveniences
that
could
be
avoided
besides
it
is
not
robbery
to
take
property
belonging
to
your
mother
she
does
prosecute
you
and
david
was
very
well
behaved
to
his
mother
he
comforted
her
by
speaking
highly
of
himself
to
her
and
assuring
her
that
he
never
fell
into
the
vices
he
saw
practised
by
other
youths
of
his
own
age
and
that
he
was
particularly
fond
of
honesty
if
his
mother
would
have
given
him
her
twenty
guineas
as
a
reward
of
this
noble
disposition
he
really
would
not
have
stolen
them
from
her
and
it
would
have
been
more
agreeable
to
his
feelings
nevertheless
to
an
active
mind
like
david
ingenuity
is
not
without
its
pleasures
it
was
rather
an
interesting
occupation
to
become
stealthily
acquainted
with
the
wards
of
his
mother
simple
key
not
in
the
least
like
chubb
patent
and
to
get
one
that
would
do
its
work
equally
well
and
also
to
arrange
a
little
drama
by
which
he
would
escape
suspicion
and
run
no
risk
of
forfeiting
the
prospective
hundred
at
his
father
death
which
would
be
convenient
in
the
improbable
case
of
his
making
a
large
fortune
in
the
indies
first
he
spoke
freely
of
his
intention
to
start
shortly
for
liverpool
and
take
ship
for
america
a
resolution
which
cost
his
good
mother
some
pain
for
after
jacob
the
idiot
there
was
not
one
of
her
sons
to
whom
her
heart
clung
more
than
to
her
david
next
it
appeared
to
him
that
sunday
afternoon
when
everybody
was
gone
to
church
except
jacob
and
the
cowboy
was
so
singularly
favourable
an
opportunity
for
sons
who
wanted
to
appropriate
their
mothers
guineas
that
he
half
thought
it
must
have
been
kindly
intended
by
providence
for
such
purposes
especially
the
third
sunday
in
lent
because
jacob
had
been
out
on
one
of
his
occasional
wanderings
for
the
last
two
days
and
david
being
a
timid
young
man
had
a
considerable
dread
and
hatred
of
jacob
as
of
a
large
personage
who
went
about
habitually
with
a
pitchfork
in
his
hand
nothing
could
be
easier
then
than
for
david
on
this
sunday
afternoon
to
decline
going
to
church
on
the
ground
that
he
was
going
to
tea
at
lunn
whose
pretty
daughter
sally
had
been
an
early
flame
of
his
and
when
the
were
at
a
safe
distance
to
abstract
the
guineas
from
their
wooden
box
and
slip
them
into
a
small
canvas
bag
nothing
easier
than
to
call
to
the
cowboy
that
he
was
going
and
tell
him
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
house
for
fear
of
sunday
tramps
david
thought
it
would
be
easy
too
to
get
to
a
small
thicket
and
bury
his
bag
in
a
hole
he
had
already
made
and
covered
up
under
the
roots
of
an
old
hollow
ash
and
he
had
in
fact
found
the
hole
without
a
moment
difficulty
had
uncovered
it
and
was
about
gently
to
drop
the
bag
into
it
when
the
sound
of
a
large
body
rustling
towards
him
with
something
like
a
bellow
was
such
a
surprise
to
david
who
as
a
gentleman
gifted
with
much
contrivance
was
naturally
only
prepared
for
what
he
expected
that
instead
of
dropping
the
bag
gently
he
let
it
fall
so
as
to
make
it
untwist
and
vomit
forth
the
shining
guineas
in
the
same
moment
he
looked
up
and
saw
his
dear
brother
jacob
close
upon
him
holding
the
pitchfork
so
that
the
bright
smooth
prongs
were
a
yard
in
advance
of
his
own
body
and
about
a
foot
off
david
a
learned
friend
to
whom
i
once
narrated
this
history
observed
that
it
was
david
guilt
which
made
these
prongs
formidable
and
that
the
mens
nil
conscia
sibi
strips
a
pitchfork
of
all
terrors
i
thought
this
idea
so
valuable
that
i
obtained
his
leave
to
use
it
on
condition
of
suppressing
his
name
nevertheless
david
did
not
entirely
lose
his
presence
of
mind
for
in
that
case
he
would
have
sunk
on
the
earth
or
started
backward
whereas
he
kept
his
ground
and
smiled
at
jacob
who
nodded
his
head
up
and
down
and
said
hoich
zavy
in
a
painfully
equivocal
manner
david
heart
was
beating
audibly
and
if
he
had
had
any
lips
they
would
have
been
pale
but
his
mental
activity
instead
of
being
paralysed
was
stimulated
while
he
was
inwardly
praying
he
always
prayed
when
he
was
much
frightened
oh
save
me
this
once
and
i
never
get
into
danger
again
he
was
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
in
search
of
a
box
of
yellow
lozenges
which
he
had
brought
with
him
from
brigford
among
other
delicacies
of
the
same
portable
kind
as
a
means
of
conciliating
proud
beauty
and
more
particularly
the
beauty
of
miss
sarah
lunn
not
one
of
these
delicacies
had
he
ever
offered
to
poor
jacob
for
david
was
not
a
young
man
to
waste
his
jujubes
and
in
giving
pleasure
to
people
from
whom
he
expected
nothing
but
an
idiot
with
equivocal
intentions
and
a
pitchfork
is
as
well
worth
flattering
and
cajoling
as
if
he
were
louis
napoleon
so
david
with
a
promptitude
equal
to
the
occasion
drew
out
his
box
of
yellow
lozenges
lifted
the
lid
and
performed
a
pantomime
with
his
mouth
and
fingers
which
was
meant
to
imply
that
he
was
delighted
to
see
his
dear
brother
jacob
and
seized
the
opportunity
of
making
him
a
small
present
which
he
would
find
particularly
agreeable
to
the
taste
jacob
you
understand
was
not
an
intense
idiot
but
within
a
certain
limited
range
knew
how
to
choose
the
good
and
reject
the
evil
he
took
one
lozenge
by
way
of
test
and
sucked
it
as
if
he
had
been
a
philosopher
then
in
as
great
an
ecstacy
at
its
new
and
complex
savour
as
caliban
at
the
taste
of
trinculo
wine
chuckled
and
stroked
this
suddenly
beneficent
brother
and
held
out
his
hand
for
more
for
except
in
fits
of
anger
jacob
was
not
ferocious
or
needlessly
predatory
courage
half
returned
and
he
left
off
praying
pouring
a
dozen
lozenges
into
jacob
palm
and
trying
to
look
very
fond
of
him
he
congratulated
himself
that
he
had
formed
the
plan
of
going
to
see
miss
sally
lunn
this
afternoon
and
that
as
a
consequence
he
had
brought
with
him
these
propitiatory
delicacies
he
was
certainly
a
lucky
fellow
indeed
it
was
always
likely
providence
should
be
fonder
of
him
than
of
other
apprentices
and
since
he
to
be
interrupted
why
an
idiot
was
preferable
to
any
other
sort
of
witness
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
david
thought
he
saw
the
advantage
of
idiots
as
for
jacob
he
had
thrust
his
pitchfork
into
the
ground
and
had
thrown
himself
down
beside
it
in
thorough
abandonment
to
the
unprecedented
pleasure
of
having
five
lozenges
in
his
mouth
at
once
blinking
meanwhile
and
making
inarticulate
sounds
of
gustative
content
he
had
not
yet
given
any
sign
of
noticing
the
guineas
but
in
seating
himself
he
had
laid
his
broad
right
hand
on
them
and
unconsciously
kept
it
in
that
position
absorbed
in
the
sensations
of
his
palate
if
he
could
only
be
kept
so
occupied
with
the
lozenges
as
not
to
see
the
guineas
before
david
could
manage
to
cover
them
that
was
david
best
hope
of
safety
for
jacob
knew
his
mother
guineas
it
had
been
part
of
their
common
experience
as
boys
to
be
allowed
to
look
at
these
handsome
coins
and
rattle
them
in
their
box
on
high
days
and
holidays
and
among
all
narrow
experiences
as
to
money
this
was
likely
to
be
the
most
memorable
here
jacob
said
david
in
an
insinuating
tone
handing
the
box
to
him
i
give
all
to
you
run
make
haste
else
somebody
come
and
take
david
not
having
studied
the
psychology
of
idiots
was
not
aware
that
they
are
not
to
be
wrought
upon
by
imaginative
fears
jacob
took
the
box
with
his
left
hand
but
saw
no
necessity
for
running
away
was
ever
a
promising
young
man
wishing
to
lay
the
foundation
of
his
fortune
by
appropriating
his
mother
guineas
obstructed
by
such
a
as
this
but
the
moment
must
come
when
jacob
would
move
his
right
hand
to
draw
off
the
lid
of
the
tin
box
and
then
david
would
sweep
the
guineas
into
the
hole
with
the
utmost
address
and
swiftness
and
immediately
seat
himself
upon
them
ah
no
it
of
no
use
to
have
foresight
when
you
are
dealing
with
an
idiot
he
is
not
to
be
calculated
upon
jacob
right
hand
was
given
to
vague
clutching
and
throwing
it
suddenly
clutched
the
guineas
as
if
they
had
been
so
many
pebbles
and
was
raised
in
an
attitude
which
promised
to
scatter
them
like
seed
over
a
distant
bramble
when
from
some
prompting
or
other
probably
of
an
unwonted
sensation
it
paused
descended
to
jacob
knee
and
opened
slowly
under
the
inspection
of
jacob
dull
eyes
david
began
to
pray
again
but
immediately
desisted
another
resource
having
occurred
to
him
mother
zinnies
exclaimed
the
innocent
jacob
then
looking
at
david
he
said
interrogatively
box
hush
hush
said
david
summoning
all
his
ingenuity
in
this
severe
strait
see
jacob
he
took
the
tin
box
from
his
brother
hand
and
emptied
it
of
the
lozenges
returning
half
of
them
to
jacob
but
secretly
keeping
the
rest
in
his
own
hand
then
he
held
out
the
empty
box
and
said
here
the
box
jacob
the
box
for
the
guineas
gently
sweeping
them
from
jacob
palm
into
the
box
this
procedure
was
not
objectionable
to
jacob
on
the
contrary
the
guineas
clinked
so
pleasantly
as
they
fell
that
he
wished
for
a
repetition
of
the
sound
and
seizing
the
box
began
to
rattle
it
very
gleefully
david
seizing
the
opportunity
deposited
his
reserve
of
lozenges
in
the
ground
and
hastily
swept
some
earth
over
them
look
jacob
he
said
at
last
jacob
paused
from
his
clinking
and
looked
into
the
hole
while
david
began
to
scratch
away
the
earth
as
if
in
doubtful
expectation
when
the
lozenges
were
laid
bare
he
took
them
out
one
by
one
and
gave
them
to
jacob
hush
he
said
in
a
loud
whisper
tell
nobody
all
for
jacob
hush
sh
sh
put
guineas
in
the
hole
they
come
out
like
this
to
make
the
lesson
more
complete
he
took
a
guinea
and
lowering
it
into
the
hole
said
put
in
then
as
he
took
the
last
lozenge
out
he
said
come
out
and
put
the
lozenge
into
jacob
hospitable
mouth
jacob
turned
his
head
on
one
side
looked
first
at
his
brother
and
then
at
the
hole
like
a
reflective
monkey
and
finally
laid
the
box
of
guineas
in
the
hole
with
much
decision
david
made
haste
to
add
every
one
of
the
stray
coins
put
on
the
lid
and
covered
it
well
with
earth
saying
in
his
meet
coaxing
tone
take
out
jacob
all
for
jacob
hush
sh
sh
jacob
to
whom
this
once
indifferent
brother
had
all
at
once
become
a
sort
of
fetish
stroked
david
best
coat
with
his
adhesive
fingers
and
then
hugged
him
with
an
accompaniment
of
that
mingled
chuckling
and
gurgling
by
which
he
was
accustomed
to
express
the
milder
passions
but
if
he
had
chosen
to
bite
a
small
morsel
out
of
his
beneficent
brother
cheek
david
would
have
been
obliged
to
bear
it
and
here
i
must
pause
to
point
out
to
you
the
of
human
contrivance
this
ingenious
young
man
david
faux
thought
he
had
achieved
a
triumph
of
cunning
when
he
had
associated
himself
in
his
brother
rudimentary
mind
with
the
flavour
of
yellow
lozenges
but
he
had
yet
to
learn
that
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
make
an
idiot
fond
of
you
when
you
yourself
are
not
of
an
affectionate
disposition
especially
an
idiot
with
a
pitchfork
obviously
a
difficult
friend
to
shake
off
by
rough
usage
it
may
seem
to
you
rather
a
blundering
contrivance
for
a
clever
young
man
to
bury
the
guineas
but
if
everything
had
turned
out
as
david
had
calculated
you
would
have
seen
that
his
plan
was
worthy
of
his
talents
the
guineas
would
have
lain
safely
in
the
earth
while
the
theft
was
discovered
and
david
with
the
calm
of
conscious
innocence
would
have
lingered
at
home
reluctant
to
say
to
his
dear
mother
while
she
was
in
grief
about
her
guineas
till
at
length
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
he
would
have
disinterred
them
in
the
strictest
privacy
and
carried
them
on
his
own
person
without
inconvenience
but
david
you
perceive
had
reckoned
without
his
host
or
to
speak
more
precisely
without
his
idiot
brother
an
item
of
so
uncertain
and
fluctuating
a
character
that
i
doubt
whether
he
would
not
have
puzzled
the
astute
heroes
of
de
balzac
whose
foresight
is
so
remarkably
at
home
in
the
future
it
was
clear
to
david
now
that
he
had
only
one
alternative
before
him
he
must
either
renounce
the
guineas
by
quietly
putting
them
back
in
his
mother
drawer
a
course
not
unattended
with
difficulty
or
he
must
leave
more
than
a
suspicion
behind
him
by
departing
early
the
next
morning
without
giving
notice
and
with
the
guineas
in
his
pocket
for
if
he
gave
notice
that
he
was
going
his
mother
he
knew
would
insist
on
fetching
from
her
box
of
guineas
the
three
she
had
always
promised
him
as
his
share
indeed
in
his
original
plan
he
had
counted
on
this
as
a
means
by
which
the
theft
would
be
discovered
under
circumstances
that
would
themselves
speak
for
his
innocence
but
now
as
i
need
hardly
explain
that
plan
was
completely
frustrated
even
if
david
could
have
bribed
jacob
with
perpetual
lozenges
an
idiot
secrecy
is
itself
betrayal
he
dared
not
even
go
to
tea
at
lunn
for
in
that
case
he
would
have
lost
sight
of
jacob
who
in
his
impatience
for
the
crop
of
lozenges
might
scratch
up
the
box
again
while
he
was
absent
and
carry
it
home
depriving
him
at
once
of
reputation
and
guineas
no
he
must
think
of
nothing
all
the
rest
of
this
day
but
of
coaxing
jacob
and
keeping
him
out
of
mischief
it
was
a
fatiguing
and
anxious
evening
to
david
nevertheless
he
dared
not
go
to
sleep
without
tying
a
piece
of
string
to
his
thumb
and
great
toe
to
secure
his
frequent
waking
for
he
meant
to
be
up
with
the
first
peep
of
dawn
and
be
far
out
of
reach
before
his
father
he
thought
would
certainly
cut
him
off
with
a
shilling
but
what
then
such
a
striking
young
man
as
he
would
be
sure
to
be
well
received
in
the
west
indies
in
foreign
countries
there
are
always
openings
even
for
cats
it
was
probable
that
some
princess
yarico
would
want
him
to
marry
her
and
make
him
presents
of
very
large
jewels
beforehand
after
which
he
need
marry
her
unless
he
liked
david
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
steal
any
more
even
from
people
who
were
fond
of
him
it
was
an
unpleasant
way
of
making
your
fortune
in
a
world
where
you
were
likely
to
surprised
in
the
act
by
brothers
such
alarms
did
not
agree
with
david
constitution
and
he
had
felt
so
much
nausea
this
evening
that
no
doubt
his
liver
was
affected
besides
he
would
have
been
greatly
hurt
not
to
be
thought
well
of
in
the
world
he
always
meant
to
make
a
figure
and
be
thought
worthy
of
the
best
seats
and
the
best
morsels
ruminating
to
this
effect
on
the
brilliant
future
in
reserve
for
him
david
by
the
help
of
his
kept
himself
on
the
alert
to
seize
the
time
of
earliest
dawn
for
his
rising
and
departure
his
brothers
of
course
were
early
risers
but
he
should
anticipate
them
by
at
least
an
hour
and
a
half
and
the
little
room
which
he
had
to
himself
as
only
an
occasional
visitor
had
its
window
over
the
so
that
he
could
slip
out
through
the
window
without
the
least
difficulty
jacob
the
horrible
jacob
had
an
awkward
trick
of
getting
up
before
everybody
else
to
stem
his
hunger
by
emptying
the
that
was
duly
set
for
him
but
of
late
he
had
taken
to
sleeping
in
the
and
if
he
came
into
the
house
it
would
be
on
the
opposite
side
to
that
from
which
david
was
making
his
exit
there
was
no
need
to
think
of
jacob
yet
david
was
liberal
enough
to
bestow
a
curse
on
him
it
was
the
only
thing
he
ever
did
bestow
gratuitously
his
small
bundle
of
clothes
was
ready
packed
and
he
was
soon
treading
lightly
on
the
steps
of
the
soon
walking
at
a
smart
pace
across
the
fields
towards
the
thicket
it
would
take
him
no
more
than
two
minutes
to
get
out
the
box
he
could
make
out
the
tree
it
was
under
by
the
pale
strip
where
the
bark
was
off
although
the
dawning
light
was
rather
dimmer
in
the
thicket
but
what
in
the
name
of
burnt
pastry
was
that
large
body
with
a
staff
planted
beside
it
close
at
the
foot
of
the
david
paused
not
to
make
up
his
mind
as
to
the
nature
of
the
apparition
he
had
not
the
happiness
of
doubting
for
a
moment
that
the
staff
was
jacob
pitchfork
but
to
gather
the
necessary
for
addressing
his
brother
with
a
sufficiently
honeyed
accent
jacob
was
absorbed
in
scratching
up
the
earth
and
had
not
heard
david
approach
i
say
jacob
said
david
in
a
loud
whisper
just
as
the
tin
box
was
lifted
out
of
the
hole
jacob
looked
up
and
discerning
his
brother
nodded
and
grinned
in
the
dim
light
in
a
way
that
made
him
seem
to
david
like
a
triumphant
demon
if
he
had
been
of
an
impetuous
disposition
he
would
have
snatched
the
pitchfork
from
the
ground
and
impaled
this
fraternal
demon
but
david
was
by
no
means
impetuous
he
was
a
young
man
greatly
given
to
calculate
consequences
a
habit
which
has
been
held
to
be
the
foundation
of
virtue
but
somehow
it
had
not
precisely
that
effect
in
david
he
calculated
whether
an
action
would
harm
himself
or
whether
it
would
only
harm
other
people
in
the
former
case
he
was
very
timid
about
satisfying
his
immediate
desires
but
in
the
latter
he
would
risk
the
result
with
much
courage
give
it
me
jacob
he
said
stooping
down
and
patting
his
brother
let
us
see
jacob
finding
the
lid
rather
tight
gave
the
box
to
his
brother
in
perfect
faith
david
raised
the
lids
and
shook
his
head
while
jacob
put
his
finger
in
and
took
out
a
guinea
to
taste
whether
the
metamorphosis
into
lozenges
was
complete
and
satisfactory
no
jacob
too
soon
too
soon
said
david
when
the
guinea
had
been
tasted
give
it
me
we
go
and
bury
it
somewhere
else
we
put
it
in
yonder
he
added
pointing
vaguely
toward
the
distance
david
screwed
on
the
lid
while
jacob
looking
grave
rose
and
grasped
his
pitchfork
then
seeing
david
bundle
he
snatched
it
like
a
too
officious
newfoundland
stuck
his
pitchfork
into
it
and
carried
it
over
his
shoulder
in
triumph
as
he
accompanied
david
and
the
box
out
of
the
thicket
what
on
earth
was
david
to
do
it
would
have
been
easy
to
frown
at
jacob
and
kick
him
and
order
him
to
get
away
but
david
dared
as
soon
have
kicked
the
bull
jacob
was
quiet
as
long
as
he
was
treated
indulgently
but
on
the
slightest
show
of
anger
he
became
unmanageable
and
was
liable
to
fits
of
fury
which
would
have
made
him
formidable
even
without
his
pitchfork
there
was
no
mastery
to
be
obtained
over
him
except
by
kindness
or
guile
david
tried
guile
go
jacob
he
said
when
they
were
out
of
the
thicket
pointing
towards
the
house
as
he
spoke
go
and
fetch
me
a
spade
a
spade
but
give
the
bundle
he
added
trying
to
reach
it
from
the
fork
where
it
hung
high
above
jacob
tall
shoulder
but
jacob
showed
as
much
alacrity
in
obeying
as
a
wasp
shows
in
leaving
a
near
david
he
felt
himself
in
the
vicinity
of
lozenges
he
chuckled
and
rubbed
his
brother
back
brandishing
the
bundle
higher
out
of
reach
david
with
an
inward
groan
changed
his
tactics
and
walked
on
as
fast
as
he
could
it
was
not
safe
to
linger
jacob
would
get
tired
of
following
him
or
at
all
events
could
be
eluded
if
they
could
once
get
to
the
distant
highroad
a
coach
would
overtake
them
david
would
mount
it
having
previously
by
some
ingenious
means
secured
his
bundle
and
then
jacob
might
howl
and
flourish
his
pitchfork
as
much
as
he
liked
meanwhile
he
was
under
the
fatal
necessity
of
being
very
kind
to
this
ogre
and
of
providing
a
large
breakfast
for
him
when
they
stopped
at
a
roadside
inn
it
was
already
three
hours
since
they
had
started
and
david
was
tired
would
no
coach
be
coming
up
soon
he
inquired
no
coach
for
the
next
two
hours
but
there
was
a
cart
to
come
immediately
on
its
way
to
the
next
town
if
he
could
slip
out
even
leaving
his
bundle
behind
and
get
into
the
cart
without
jacob
but
there
was
a
new
obstacle
jacob
had
recently
discovered
a
remnant
of
in
one
of
his
brother
and
since
then
had
cautiously
kept
his
hold
on
that
limb
of
the
garment
perhaps
with
an
expectation
that
there
would
be
a
further
development
of
after
a
longer
or
shorter
interval
now
every
one
who
has
worn
a
coat
will
understand
the
sensibilities
that
must
keep
a
man
from
starting
away
in
a
hurry
when
there
is
a
grasp
on
his
david
looked
forward
to
being
well
received
among
strangers
but
it
might
make
a
difference
if
he
had
only
one
tail
to
his
coat
he
felt
himself
in
a
cold
perspiration
he
could
walk
no
more
he
must
get
into
the
cart
and
let
jacob
get
in
with
him
presently
a
cheering
idea
occurred
to
him
after
so
large
a
breakfast
jacob
would
be
sure
to
go
to
sleep
in
the
cart
you
see
at
once
that
david
meant
to
seize
his
bundle
jump
out
and
be
free
his
expectation
was
partly
fulfilled
jacob
did
go
to
sleep
in
the
cart
but
it
was
in
a
peculiar
attitude
it
was
with
his
arms
tightly
fastened
round
his
dear
brother
body
and
if
ever
david
attempted
to
move
the
grasp
tightened
with
the
force
of
an
affectionate
th
innicent
fond
on
you
observed
the
carrier
thinking
that
david
was
probably
an
amiable
brother
and
wishing
to
pay
him
a
compliment
david
groaned
the
ways
of
thieving
were
not
ways
of
pleasantness
oh
why
had
he
an
idiot
brother
oh
why
in
general
was
the
world
so
constituted
that
a
man
could
not
take
his
mother
guineas
comfortably
david
became
grimly
speculative
copious
dinner
at
noon
for
jacob
but
little
dinner
because
little
appetite
for
david
instead
of
eating
he
plied
jacob
with
beer
for
through
this
liberality
he
descried
a
hope
jacob
fell
into
a
dead
sleep
at
last
without
having
his
arms
round
david
who
paid
the
reckoning
took
his
bundle
and
walked
off
in
another
he
was
on
the
coach
on
his
way
to
liverpool
smiling
the
smile
of
the
triumphant
wicked
he
was
rid
of
jacob
he
was
bound
for
the
indies
where
a
gullible
princess
awaited
him
he
would
never
steal
any
more
but
there
would
be
no
need
he
would
show
himself
so
deserving
that
people
would
make
him
presents
freely
he
must
give
up
the
notion
of
his
legacy
but
it
was
not
likely
he
would
ever
want
that
trifle
and
even
if
he
did
why
it
was
a
compensation
to
think
that
in
being
for
ever
divided
from
his
family
he
was
divided
from
jacob
more
terrible
than
gorgon
or
demogorgon
to
david
timid
green
eyes
thank
heaven
he
should
never
see
jacob
any
more
chapter
ii
it
was
nearly
six
years
after
the
departure
of
david
faux
for
the
west
indies
that
the
vacant
shop
in
the
at
grimworth
was
understood
to
have
been
let
to
the
stranger
with
a
sallow
complexion
and
a
buff
cravat
whose
first
appearance
had
caused
some
excitement
in
the
bar
of
the
woolpack
where
he
had
called
to
wait
for
the
coach
grimworth
to
a
discerning
eye
was
a
good
place
to
set
up
shopkeeping
in
there
was
no
competition
in
it
at
present
the
had
their
own
grocer
and
draper
the
dissenters
had
theirs
and
the
two
or
three
butchers
found
a
ready
market
for
their
joints
without
strict
reference
to
religious
persuasion
except
that
the
rector
wife
had
given
a
general
order
for
the
veal
and
the
mutton
kidneys
while
rodd
the
baptist
minister
had
requested
that
so
far
as
was
compatible
with
the
fair
accommodation
of
other
customers
the
trotters
might
be
reserved
for
him
and
it
was
likely
to
be
a
growing
place
for
the
trustees
of
zephaniah
crypt
charity
under
the
stimulus
of
a
late
visitation
by
commissioners
were
beginning
to
apply
funds
to
the
rebuilding
of
the
yellow
coat
school
which
was
henceforth
to
be
carried
forward
on
a
scale
the
testator
having
left
no
restrictions
concerning
the
curriculum
but
only
concerning
the
coat
the
shopkeepers
at
grimworth
were
by
no
means
unanimous
as
to
the
advantages
promised
by
this
prospect
of
increased
population
and
trading
being
substantial
men
who
liked
doing
a
quiet
business
in
which
they
were
sure
of
their
customers
and
could
calculate
their
returns
to
a
nicety
hitherto
it
had
been
held
a
point
of
honour
by
the
families
in
grimworth
parish
to
buy
their
sugar
and
their
flannel
at
the
shop
where
their
fathers
and
mothers
had
bought
before
them
but
if
newcomers
were
to
bring
in
the
system
of
trading
and
solicit
feminine
eyes
by
laid
in
folds
and
surmounted
by
artificial
flowers
giving
them
a
factitious
charm
for
on
what
human
figure
would
a
gown
sit
like
a
fan
or
what
female
head
was
like
a
bunch
of
or
if
new
grocers
were
to
fill
their
windows
with
mountains
of
currants
and
sugar
made
seductive
by
contrast
and
tickets
what
security
was
there
for
grimworth
that
a
vagrant
spirit
in
shopping
once
introduced
would
not
in
the
end
carry
the
most
important
families
to
the
larger
market
town
of
cattleton
where
business
being
done
on
a
system
of
small
profits
and
quick
returns
the
fashions
were
of
the
freshest
and
goods
of
all
kinds
might
be
bought
at
an
advantage
with
this
view
of
the
times
predominant
among
the
tradespeople
at
grimworth
their
uncertainty
concerning
the
nature
of
the
business
which
the
stranger
was
about
to
set
up
in
the
vacant
shop
naturally
gave
some
additional
strength
to
the
fears
of
the
less
sanguine
if
he
was
going
to
sell
drapery
it
was
probable
that
a
faced
fellow
like
that
would
deal
in
showy
and
inferior
articles
printed
cottons
and
muslins
which
would
leave
their
dye
in
the
jobbed
linen
full
of
knots
and
flannel
that
would
soon
look
like
gauze
if
grocery
then
it
was
to
be
hoped
that
no
mother
of
a
family
would
trust
the
teas
of
an
untried
grocer
such
things
had
been
known
in
some
parishes
as
tradesmen
going
about
canvassing
for
custom
with
cards
in
their
pockets
when
people
came
from
nobody
knew
where
there
was
no
knowing
what
they
might
do
it
was
a
thousand
pities
that
moffat
the
auctioneer
and
broker
had
died
without
leaving
anybody
to
follow
him
in
the
business
and
cleve
trustee
ought
to
have
known
better
than
to
let
a
shop
to
a
stranger
even
the
discovery
that
ovens
were
being
put
up
on
the
premises
and
that
the
shop
was
in
fact
being
fitted
up
for
a
confectioner
and
business
hitherto
unknown
in
grimworth
did
not
quite
suffice
to
turn
the
scale
in
the
favour
though
the
landlady
at
the
woolpack
defended
him
warmly
said
he
seemed
to
be
a
very
clever
young
man
and
from
what
she
could
make
out
came
of
a
very
good
family
indeed
was
most
likely
a
good
many
betters
it
certainly
made
a
blaze
of
light
and
colour
almost
as
if
a
rainbow
had
suddenly
descended
into
the
when
one
fine
morning
the
shutters
were
taken
down
from
the
new
shop
and
the
two
windows
displayed
their
decorations
on
one
side
there
were
the
variegated
tints
of
collared
and
marbled
meats
set
off
by
bright
green
leaves
the
pale
brown
of
glazed
pies
the
rich
tones
of
sauces
and
bottled
fruits
enclosed
in
their
veil
of
glass
altogether
a
sight
to
bring
tears
into
the
eyes
of
a
dutch
painter
and
on
the
other
there
was
a
predominance
of
the
more
delicate
hues
of
pink
and
white
and
yellow
and
buff
in
the
abundant
lozenges
candies
sweet
biscuits
and
icings
which
to
the
eyes
of
a
bilious
person
might
easily
have
been
blended
into
a
faery
landscape
in
turner
latest
style
what
a
sight
to
dawn
upon
the
eyes
of
grimworth
children
they
almost
forgot
to
go
to
their
dinner
that
day
their
appetites
being
preoccupied
with
imaginary
and
i
think
even
punch
setting
up
his
tabernacle
in
the
would
not
have
succeeded
in
drawing
them
away
from
those
where
they
stood
according
to
gradations
of
size
and
strength
the
biggest
and
strongest
being
nearest
the
window
and
the
little
ones
in
the
outermost
rows
lifting
eyes
and
mouths
towards
the
upper
tier
of
jars
like
small
birds
at
the
elder
inhabitants
pished
and
pshawed
a
little
at
the
folly
of
the
new
shopkeeper
in
venturing
on
such
an
outlay
in
goods
that
would
not
keep
to
be
sure
christmas
was
coming
but
what
housewife
in
grimworth
would
not
think
shame
to
furnish
forth
her
table
with
articles
that
were
not
no
no
edward
freely
as
he
called
himself
was
deceived
if
he
thought
grimworth
money
was
to
flow
into
his
pockets
on
such
terms
edward
freely
was
the
name
that
shone
in
gilt
letters
on
a
mazarine
ground
over
the
doorplace
of
the
new
shop
a
name
that
might
have
belonged
to
the
improvident
hero
of
an
old
comedy
who
would
have
delighted
in
raining
sugared
almonds
like
a
new
among
that
small
generation
outside
the
windows
but
edward
freely
was
a
man
whose
impulses
were
kept
in
due
subordination
he
held
that
the
desire
for
sweets
and
pastry
must
only
be
satisfied
in
a
direct
ratio
with
the
power
of
paying
for
them
if
the
smallest
child
in
grimworth
would
go
to
him
with
a
halfpenny
in
its
tiny
fist
he
would
after
ringing
the
halfpenny
deliver
a
just
equivalent
in
rock
he
was
not
a
man
to
cheat
even
the
smallest
child
he
often
said
so
observing
at
the
same
time
that
he
loved
honesty
and
also
that
he
was
very
hearted
though
he
did
show
his
feelings
as
some
people
did
either
in
reward
of
such
virtue
or
according
to
some
more
hidden
law
of
sequence
mr
freely
business
in
spite
of
prejudice
started
under
favourable
auspices
for
chaloner
the
rector
wife
was
among
the
earliest
customers
at
the
shop
thinking
it
only
right
to
encourage
a
new
parishioner
who
had
made
a
decorous
appearance
at
church
and
she
found
mr
freely
a
most
civil
obliging
young
man
and
intelligent
to
a
surprising
degree
for
a
confectioner
too
for
in
giving
her
useful
hints
about
choosing
sugars
he
had
thrown
much
light
on
the
dishonesty
of
other
tradesmen
moreover
he
had
been
in
the
west
indies
and
had
seen
the
very
estate
which
had
been
her
poor
property
and
he
said
the
missionaries
were
the
only
cause
of
the
discontent
an
observing
young
man
evidently
chaloner
ordered
and
olives
and
gave
mr
freely
to
understand
that
she
should
find
his
shop
a
great
convenience
so
did
the
doctor
wife
and
so
did
gate
at
the
large
who
having
high
connexions
frequently
visiting
her
might
be
expected
to
have
a
large
consumption
of
ratafias
and
macaroons
the
less
aristocratic
matrons
of
grimworth
seemed
likely
at
first
to
justify
their
husbands
confidence
that
they
would
never
pay
a
percentage
of
profits
on
instead
of
making
their
own
or
get
up
a
hollow
show
of
liberal
housekeeping
by
purchasing
slices
of
collared
meat
when
a
neighbour
came
in
for
supper
but
it
is
my
task
to
narrate
the
gradual
corruption
of
grimworth
manners
from
their
primitive
simplicity
a
melancholy
task
if
it
were
not
cheered
by
the
prospect
of
the
fine
peripateia
or
downfall
by
which
the
progress
of
the
corruption
was
ultimately
checked
it
was
young
steene
the
veterinary
surgeons
wife
who
first
gave
way
to
temptation
i
fear
she
had
been
rather
for
her
station
in
life
for
she
knew
by
heart
many
passages
in
the
and
the
of
which
had
given
her
a
distaste
for
domestic
occupations
and
caused
her
a
withering
disappointment
at
the
discovery
that
steene
since
his
marriage
had
lost
all
interest
in
the
bulbul
openly
preferred
discussing
the
nature
of
spavin
with
a
coarse
neighbour
and
was
angry
if
the
pudding
turned
out
watery
indeed
was
simply
a
vet
who
came
in
hungry
at
and
not
in
the
least
like
a
nobleman
turned
corsair
out
of
pure
scorn
for
his
race
or
like
a
renegade
with
a
turban
and
crescent
unless
it
were
in
the
irritability
of
his
temper
and
scorn
is
such
a
very
different
thing
in
this
brutal
man
had
invited
a
for
christmas
eve
when
he
would
expect
to
see
on
the
table
steene
had
prepared
her
and
had
devoted
much
butter
fine
flour
and
labour
to
the
making
of
a
batch
of
pies
in
the
morning
but
they
proved
to
be
so
very
heavy
when
they
came
out
of
the
oven
that
she
could
only
think
with
trembling
of
the
moment
when
her
husband
should
catch
sight
of
them
on
the
he
would
storm
at
her
she
was
certain
and
before
all
the
company
and
then
she
should
never
help
crying
it
was
so
dreadful
to
think
she
had
come
to
that
after
the
bulbul
and
everything
suddenly
the
thought
darted
through
her
mind
that
she
might
send
for
a
dish
of
from
freely
she
knew
he
had
some
but
what
was
to
become
of
the
eighteen
heavy
oh
it
was
of
no
use
thinking
about
that
it
was
very
expensive
indeed
making
at
all
was
a
great
expense
when
they
were
not
sure
to
turn
out
well
it
would
be
much
better
to
buy
them
you
paid
a
little
more
for
them
but
there
was
no
risk
of
waste
such
was
the
sophistry
with
which
this
misguided
young
woman
enough
steene
sent
for
the
and
i
am
grieved
to
add
garbled
her
household
accounts
in
order
to
conceal
the
fact
from
her
husband
this
was
the
second
step
in
a
downward
course
all
owing
to
a
young
woman
being
out
of
harmony
with
her
circumstances
yearning
after
renegades
and
bulbuls
and
being
subject
to
claims
from
a
veterinary
surgeon
fond
of
the
third
step
was
to
harden
herself
by
telling
the
fact
of
the
bought
to
her
intimate
friend
mole
who
had
already
guessed
it
and
who
subsequently
encouraged
herself
in
buying
a
mould
of
jelly
instead
of
exerting
her
own
skill
by
the
reflection
that
other
people
did
the
same
sort
of
thing
the
infection
spread
soon
there
was
a
party
or
clique
in
grimworth
on
the
side
of
buying
at
freely
and
many
husbands
kept
for
some
time
in
the
dark
on
this
point
innocently
swallowed
at
two
mouthfuls
a
tart
on
which
they
were
paying
a
profit
of
a
hundred
per
and
as
innocently
encouraged
a
fatal
disingenuousness
in
the
partners
of
their
bosoms
by
praising
the
pastry
others
more
winked
at
the
too
frequent
presentation
on
and
at
impromptu
suppers
of
superior
which
flattered
their
palates
more
than
the
cold
remnants
they
had
formerly
been
contented
with
every
housewife
who
had
once
bought
at
freely
felt
a
secret
joy
when
she
detected
a
similar
perversion
in
her
neighbour
practice
and
soon
only
two
or
three
fashioned
mistresses
of
families
held
out
in
the
protest
against
the
growing
demoralization
saying
to
their
neighbours
who
came
to
sup
with
them
i
ca
offer
you
freely
beef
or
freely
cheesecakes
everything
in
our
house
is
i
afraid
you
hardly
have
any
appetite
for
our
plain
pastry
the
doctor
whose
cook
was
not
satisfactory
the
curate
who
kept
no
cook
and
the
mining
agent
who
was
a
great
even
began
to
rely
on
freely
for
the
greater
part
of
their
dinner
when
they
wished
to
give
an
entertainment
of
some
brilliancy
in
short
the
business
of
manufacturing
the
more
fanciful
viands
was
fast
passing
out
of
the
hinds
of
maids
and
matrons
in
private
families
and
was
becoming
the
work
of
a
special
commercial
organ
i
am
not
ignorant
that
this
sort
of
thing
is
called
the
inevitable
course
of
civilization
division
of
labour
and
so
forth
and
that
the
maids
and
matrons
may
be
said
to
have
had
their
hands
set
free
from
cookery
to
add
to
the
wealth
of
society
in
some
other
way
only
it
happened
at
grimworth
which
to
be
sure
was
a
low
place
that
the
maids
and
matrons
could
do
nothing
with
their
hands
at
all
better
than
cooking
not
even
those
who
had
always
made
heavy
cakes
and
leathery
pastry
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
the
progress
of
civilization
at
grimworth
was
not
otherwise
apparent
than
in
the
impoverishment
of
men
the
gossiping
idleness
of
women
and
the
heightening
prosperity
of
edward
freely
the
yellow
coat
school
was
a
double
source
of
profit
to
the
calculating
confectioner
for
he
opened
an
for
the
superior
workmen
employed
on
the
new
school
and
he
accommodated
the
pupils
at
the
old
school
by
giving
great
attention
to
the
department
when
i
think
of
the
swans
and
other
ingenious
white
shapes
crunched
by
the
small
teeth
of
that
rising
generation
i
am
glad
to
remember
that
a
certain
amount
of
calcareous
food
has
been
held
good
for
young
creatures
whose
bones
are
not
quite
formed
for
i
have
observed
these
delicacies
to
have
an
inorganic
flavour
which
would
have
recommended
them
greatly
to
that
young
lady
of
the
acquaintance
who
habitually
made
her
dessert
on
the
stems
of
as
for
the
confectioner
himself
he
made
his
way
gradually
into
grimworth
homes
as
his
commodities
did
in
spite
of
some
initial
repugnance
somehow
or
other
his
reception
as
a
guest
seemed
a
thing
that
required
justifying
like
the
purchasing
of
his
pastry
in
the
first
place
he
was
a
stranger
and
therefore
open
to
suspicion
secondly
the
confectionery
business
was
so
entirely
new
at
grimworth
that
its
place
in
the
scale
of
rank
had
not
been
distinctly
ascertained
there
was
no
doubt
about
drapers
and
grocers
when
they
came
of
good
old
grimworth
families
like
mr
luff
and
prettyman
they
visited
with
the
palfreys
who
farmed
their
own
land
played
many
a
game
at
whist
with
the
doctor
and
condescended
a
little
towards
the
who
had
lately
taken
to
the
also
and
had
got
new
furniture
but
whether
a
confectioner
should
be
admitted
to
this
higher
level
of
respectability
or
should
be
understood
to
find
his
associates
among
butchers
and
bakers
was
a
new
question
on
which
tradition
threw
no
light
his
being
a
bachelor
was
in
his
favour
and
would
perhaps
have
been
enough
to
turn
the
scale
even
if
edward
freely
other
personal
pretensions
had
been
of
an
entirely
insignificant
cast
but
so
far
from
this
it
very
soon
appeared
that
he
was
a
remarkable
young
man
who
had
been
in
the
west
indies
and
had
seen
many
wonders
by
sea
and
land
so
that
he
could
charm
the
ears
of
grimworth
desdemonas
with
stories
of
strange
fishes
especially
sharks
which
he
had
stabbed
in
the
nick
of
time
by
bravely
plunging
overboard
just
as
the
monster
was
turning
on
his
side
to
devour
the
cook
mate
of
terrible
fevers
which
he
had
undergone
in
a
land
where
the
wind
blows
from
all
quarters
at
once
of
rounds
of
toast
cut
straight
from
the
breadfruit
trees
of
toes
bitten
off
by
crabs
of
large
honours
that
had
been
offered
to
him
as
a
man
who
knew
what
was
what
and
was
therefore
particularly
needed
in
a
tropical
climate
and
of
a
creole
heiress
who
had
wept
bitterly
at
his
departure
such
conversational
talents
as
these
we
know
will
overcome
disadvantages
of
complexion
and
young
towers
whose
cheeks
were
of
the
finest
pink
set
off
by
a
fringe
of
dark
whisker
was
quite
eclipsed
by
the
presence
of
the
sallow
mr
freely
so
exceptional
a
confectioner
elevated
the
business
and
might
well
begin
to
make
disengaged
hearts
flutter
a
little
fathers
and
mothers
were
naturally
more
slow
and
cautious
in
their
recognition
of
the
newcomer
merits
he
an
amusing
fellow
said
prettyman
the
highly
respectable
grocer
prettyman
was
a
miss
fothergill
and
her
sister
had
married
a
london
mercer
he
an
amusing
fellow
and
i
no
objection
to
his
making
one
at
the
oyster
club
but
he
a
bit
too
fond
of
riding
the
high
horse
he
uncommonly
knowing
i
allow
but
how
came
he
to
go
to
the
indies
i
should
like
that
answered
it
unnatural
in
a
confectioner
i
not
fond
of
people
that
have
been
beyond
seas
if
they
ca
give
a
good
account
how
they
happened
to
go
when
folks
go
so
far
off
it
because
they
got
little
credit
nearer
home
that
my
opinion
however
he
got
some
good
rum
but
i
do
want
to
be
hand
and
glove
with
him
for
all
that
it
was
this
kind
of
dim
suspicion
which
beclouded
the
view
of
mr
freely
qualities
in
the
maturer
minds
of
grimworth
through
the
early
months
of
his
residence
there
but
when
the
confectioner
ceased
to
be
a
novelty
the
suspicions
also
ceased
to
be
novel
and
people
got
tired
of
hinting
at
them
especially
as
they
seemed
to
be
refuted
by
his
advancing
prosperity
and
importance
mr
freely
was
becoming
a
person
of
influence
in
the
parish
he
was
found
useful
as
an
overseer
of
the
poor
having
great
firmness
in
enduring
other
people
pain
which
firmness
he
said
was
due
to
his
great
benevolence
he
always
did
what
was
good
for
people
in
the
end
chaloner
had
even
selected
him
as
churchwarden
for
he
was
a
very
handy
man
and
much
more
of
chaloner
opinion
in
everything
about
church
business
than
the
older
parishioners
mr
freely
was
a
very
regular
churchman
but
at
the
oyster
club
he
was
sometimes
a
little
free
in
his
conversation
more
than
hinting
at
a
life
of
sultanic
which
he
had
passed
in
the
west
indies
shaking
his
head
now
and
then
and
smiling
rather
bitterly
as
men
are
wont
to
do
when
they
intimate
that
they
have
become
a
little
too
wise
to
be
instructed
about
a
world
which
has
long
been
flat
and
stale
to
them
for
some
time
he
was
quite
general
in
his
attentions
to
the
fair
sex
combining
the
gallantries
of
a
lady
man
with
a
severity
of
criticism
on
the
person
and
manners
of
absent
belles
which
tended
rather
to
stimulate
in
the
feminine
breast
the
desire
to
conquer
the
approval
of
so
fastidious
a
judge
nothing
short
of
the
very
best
in
the
department
of
female
charms
and
virtues
could
suffice
to
kindle
the
ardour
of
edward
freely
who
had
become
familiar
with
the
most
luxuriant
and
dazzling
beauty
in
the
west
indies
it
may
seem
incredible
that
a
confectioner
should
have
ideas
and
conversation
so
much
resembling
those
to
be
met
with
in
a
higher
walk
of
life
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
had
not
merely
travelled
he
had
also
and
a
sallow
featured
visage
so
that
nature
herself
had
stamped
him
for
a
fastidious
connoisseur
of
the
fair
sex
at
last
however
it
seemed
clear
that
cupid
had
found
a
sharper
arrow
than
usual
and
that
mr
freely
heart
was
pierced
it
was
the
general
talk
among
the
young
people
at
grimworth
but
was
it
really
love
and
not
rather
ambition
miss
fullilove
the
daughter
was
quite
sure
that
if
were
miss
penny
palfrey
she
would
be
cautious
it
was
not
a
good
sign
when
men
looked
so
much
above
themselves
for
a
wife
for
it
was
no
less
a
person
than
miss
penelope
palfrey
second
daughter
of
the
palfrey
who
farmed
his
own
land
that
had
attracted
mr
freely
peculiar
regard
and
conquered
his
fastidiousness
and
no
wonder
for
the
ideal
as
exhibited
in
the
finest
waxwork
was
perhaps
never
so
closely
approached
by
the
real
as
in
the
person
of
the
pretty
penelope
her
yellowish
flaxen
hair
did
not
curl
naturally
i
admit
but
its
bright
crisp
ringlets
were
such
smooth
perfect
miniature
tubes
that
you
would
have
longed
to
pass
your
little
finger
through
them
and
feel
their
soft
elasticity
she
wore
them
in
a
crop
for
in
those
days
when
society
was
in
a
healthier
state
young
ladies
wore
crops
long
after
they
were
twenty
and
penelope
was
not
yet
nineteen
like
the
waxen
ideal
she
had
round
blue
eyes
and
round
nostrils
in
her
little
nose
and
teeth
such
as
the
ideal
would
be
seen
to
have
if
it
ever
showed
them
altogether
she
was
a
small
round
thing
as
neat
as
a
pink
and
white
double
daisy
and
as
guileless
for
i
hope
it
does
not
argue
guile
in
a
pretty
damsel
of
nineteen
to
think
that
she
should
like
to
have
a
beau
and
be
engaged
when
her
elder
sister
had
already
been
in
that
position
a
year
and
a
half
to
be
sure
there
was
young
towers
always
coming
to
the
house
but
penny
felt
convinced
he
only
came
to
see
her
brother
for
he
never
had
anything
to
say
to
her
and
never
offered
her
his
arm
and
was
as
awkward
and
silent
as
possible
it
is
not
unlikely
that
mr
freely
had
early
been
smitten
by
charms
as
brought
under
his
observation
at
church
but
he
had
to
make
his
way
in
society
a
little
before
he
could
come
into
nearer
contact
with
them
and
even
after
he
was
well
received
in
grimworth
families
it
was
a
long
while
before
he
could
converse
with
penny
otherwise
than
in
an
incidental
meeting
at
mr
luff
it
was
not
so
easy
to
get
invited
to
long
meadows
the
residence
of
the
palfreys
for
though
palfrey
had
been
losing
money
of
late
years
not
being
able
quite
to
recover
his
feet
after
the
terrible
murrain
which
forced
him
to
borrow
his
family
were
far
from
considering
themselves
on
the
same
level
even
as
the
tradespeople
with
whom
they
visited
the
greatest
people
even
kings
and
queens
must
visit
with
somebody
and
the
equals
of
the
great
are
scarce
they
were
especially
scarce
at
grimworth
which
as
i
have
before
observed
was
a
low
parish
mentioned
with
the
most
scornful
brevity
in
gazetteers
even
the
great
people
there
were
far
behind
those
of
their
own
standing
in
other
parts
of
this
realm
palfrey
farmyard
doors
had
the
paint
all
worn
off
them
and
the
front
garden
walks
had
long
been
merged
in
a
general
weediness
still
his
father
had
been
called
squire
palfrey
and
had
been
respected
by
the
last
grimworth
generation
as
a
man
who
could
afford
to
drink
too
much
in
his
own
house
pretty
penny
was
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
mr
freely
admired
her
and
she
felt
sure
that
it
was
he
who
had
sent
her
a
beautiful
valentine
but
her
sister
seemed
to
think
so
lightly
of
him
all
young
ladies
think
lightly
of
the
gentlemen
to
whom
they
are
not
engaged
that
penny
never
dared
mention
him
and
trembled
and
blushed
whenever
they
met
him
thinking
of
the
valentine
which
was
very
strong
in
its
expressions
and
which
she
felt
guilty
of
knowing
by
heart
a
man
who
had
been
to
the
indies
and
knew
the
sea
so
well
seemed
to
her
a
sort
of
public
character
almost
like
robinson
crusoe
or
captain
cook
and
penny
had
always
wished
her
husband
to
be
a
remarkable
personage
likely
to
be
put
in
mangnall
questions
with
which
register
of
the
immortals
she
had
become
acquainted
during
her
one
year
at
a
only
it
seemed
strange
that
a
remarkable
man
should
be
a
confectioner
and
cook
and
this
anomaly
quite
disturbed
penny
dreams
her
brothers
she
knew
laughed
at
men
who
could
sit
on
horseback
well
and
called
them
tailors
but
her
brothers
were
very
rough
and
were
quite
without
that
power
of
anecdote
which
made
mr
freely
such
a
delightful
companion
he
was
a
very
good
man
she
thought
for
she
had
heard
him
say
at
mr
luff
one
day
that
he
always
wished
to
do
his
duty
in
whatever
state
of
life
he
might
be
placed
and
he
knew
a
great
deal
of
poetry
for
one
day
he
had
repeated
a
verse
of
a
song
she
wondered
if
he
had
made
the
words
of
the
valentine
it
ended
in
this
way
without
thee
it
is
pain
to
live
but
with
thee
it
were
sweet
to
die
poor
mr
freely
her
father
would
very
likely
object
she
felt
sure
he
would
for
he
always
called
mr
freely
that
fellow
oh
it
was
very
cruel
when
true
love
was
crossed
in
that
way
and
all
because
mr
freely
was
a
confectioner
well
penny
would
be
true
to
him
for
all
that
and
since
his
being
a
confectioner
gave
her
an
opportunity
of
showing
her
faithfulness
she
was
glad
of
it
edward
freely
was
a
pretty
name
much
better
than
john
towers
young
towers
had
offered
her
a
rose
out
of
his
the
other
day
blushing
very
much
but
she
refused
it
and
thought
with
delight
how
much
mr
freely
would
be
comforted
if
he
knew
her
firmness
of
mind
poor
little
penny
the
days
were
so
very
long
among
the
daisies
on
a
grazing
farm
and
thought
is
so
active
how
was
it
possible
that
the
inward
drama
should
not
get
the
start
of
the
outward
i
have
known
young
ladies
much
better
educated
and
with
an
outward
world
diversified
by
instructive
lectures
to
say
nothing
of
literature
and
who
have
spun
a
cocoon
of
visionary
joys
and
sorrows
for
themselves
just
as
penny
did
her
elder
sister
letitia
who
had
a
prouder
style
of
beauty
and
a
more
worldly
ambition
was
engaged
to
a
who
came
all
the
way
from
cattelton
to
see
her
and
everybody
knows
that
a
takes
a
very
high
rank
sometimes
driving
a
gig
letty
notions
got
higher
every
day
and
penny
never
dared
to
speak
of
her
cherished
griefs
to
her
lofty
sister
never
dared
to
propose
that
they
should
call
at
mr
freely
to
buy
liquorice
though
she
had
prepared
for
such
an
incident
by
mentioning
a
slight
sore
throat
so
she
had
to
pass
the
shop
on
the
other
side
of
the
and
reflect
with
a
suppressed
sigh
that
behind
those
pink
and
white
jars
somebody
was
thinking
of
her
tenderly
unconscious
of
the
small
space
that
divided
her
from
him
and
it
was
quite
true
that
when
business
permitted
mr
freely
thought
a
great
deal
of
penny
he
thought
her
prettiness
comparable
to
the
loveliest
things
in
confectionery
he
judged
her
to
be
of
submissive
temper
likely
to
wait
upon
him
as
well
as
if
she
had
been
a
negress
and
to
be
silently
terrified
when
his
liver
made
him
irritable
and
he
considered
the
palfrey
family
quite
the
best
in
the
parish
possessing
marriageable
daughters
on
the
whole
he
thought
her
worthy
to
become
edward
freely
and
all
the
more
so
because
it
would
probably
require
some
ingenuity
to
win
her
palfrey
was
capable
of
a
too
rash
pretender
to
his
daughter
hand
and
moreover
he
had
three
tall
sons
it
was
clear
that
a
suitor
would
be
at
a
disadvantage
with
such
a
family
unless
travel
and
natural
acumen
had
given
him
a
countervailing
power
of
contrivance
and
the
first
idea
that
occurred
to
him
in
the
matter
was
that
palfrey
would
object
less
if
he
knew
that
the
freelys
were
a
much
higher
family
than
his
own
it
had
been
foolish
modesty
in
him
hitherto
to
conceal
the
fact
that
a
branch
of
the
freelys
held
a
manor
in
yorkshire
and
to
shut
up
the
portrait
of
his
great
uncle
the
admiral
instead
of
hanging
it
up
where
a
family
portrait
should
be
hung
over
the
mantelpiece
in
the
parlour
admiral
freely
once
placed
in
this
conspicuous
position
was
seen
to
have
had
one
arm
only
and
one
eye
in
these
points
resembling
the
heroic
nelson
while
a
certain
pallid
insignificance
of
feature
confirmed
the
relationship
between
himself
and
his
next
mr
freely
was
seized
with
an
irrepressible
ambition
to
posses
palfrey
receipt
for
brawn
hers
being
pronounced
on
all
hands
to
be
superior
to
his
own
as
he
informed
her
in
a
very
flattering
letter
carried
by
his
now
palfrey
like
other
geniuses
wrought
by
instinct
rather
than
by
rule
and
possessed
no
receipts
indeed
despised
all
people
who
used
them
observing
that
people
who
pickled
by
book
must
pickle
by
weights
and
measures
and
such
nonsense
as
for
herself
her
weights
and
measures
were
the
tip
of
her
finger
and
the
tip
of
her
tongue
and
if
you
went
nearer
why
of
course
for
dry
goods
like
flour
and
spice
you
went
by
handfuls
and
pinches
and
for
wet
there
was
a
jug
quite
the
best
thing
whether
for
much
or
little
because
you
might
know
how
much
a
teacupful
was
if
got
any
use
of
your
senses
and
you
might
be
sure
it
would
take
five
jugs
to
make
a
gallon
knowledge
of
this
kind
is
like
titian
colouring
difficult
to
communicate
and
as
palfrey
once
remarkably
handsome
had
now
become
rather
stout
and
asthmatical
and
scarcely
ever
left
home
her
oral
teaching
could
hardly
be
given
anywhere
except
at
long
meadows
even
a
matron
is
not
insusceptible
to
flattery
and
the
prospect
of
a
visitor
whose
great
object
would
be
to
listen
to
her
conversation
was
not
without
its
charms
to
palfrey
since
there
was
no
receipt
to
be
sent
in
reply
to
mr
freely
humble
request
she
called
on
her
more
docile
daughter
penny
to
write
a
note
telling
him
that
her
mother
would
be
glad
to
see
him
and
talk
with
him
on
brawn
any
day
that
he
could
call
at
long
meadows
penny
obeyed
with
a
trembling
hand
thinking
how
wonderfully
things
came
about
in
this
world
in
this
way
mr
freely
got
himself
introduced
into
the
home
of
the
palfreys
and
notwithstanding
a
tendency
in
the
male
part
of
the
family
to
jeer
at
him
a
little
as
peaky
and
he
presently
established
his
position
as
an
accepted
and
frequent
guest
young
towers
looked
at
him
with
increasing
disgust
when
they
met
at
the
house
on
a
sunday
and
secretly
longed
to
try
his
ferret
upon
him
as
a
piece
of
vermin
which
that
valuable
animal
would
be
likely
to
tackle
with
unhesitating
vigour
but
so
blind
sometimes
are
parents
neither
nor
palfrey
suspected
that
penny
would
have
anything
to
say
to
a
tradesman
of
questionable
rank
whose
youthful
bloom
was
much
withered
young
towers
they
thought
had
an
eye
to
her
and
was
likely
enough
to
be
a
match
some
day
but
penny
was
a
child
at
present
and
all
the
while
penny
was
imagining
the
circumstances
under
which
mr
freely
would
make
her
an
offer
perhaps
down
by
the
row
of
when
they
were
in
the
garden
before
tea
perhaps
by
letter
in
which
case
how
would
the
letter
begin
dearest
penelope
or
my
dear
miss
penelope
or
straight
off
without
dear
anything
as
seemed
the
most
natural
when
people
were
embarrassed
but
however
he
might
make
the
offer
she
would
not
accept
it
without
her
father
consent
she
would
always
be
true
to
mr
freely
but
she
would
not
disobey
her
father
for
penny
was
a
good
girl
though
some
of
her
female
friends
were
afterwards
of
opinion
that
it
spoke
ill
for
her
not
to
have
felt
an
instinctive
repugnance
to
mr
freely
but
he
was
cautious
and
wished
to
be
quite
sure
of
the
ground
he
trod
on
his
views
on
marriage
were
not
entirely
sentimental
but
were
as
duly
mingled
with
considerations
of
what
would
be
advantageous
to
a
man
in
his
position
as
if
he
had
had
a
very
large
amount
of
money
spent
on
his
education
he
was
not
a
man
to
fall
in
love
in
the
wrong
place
and
so
he
applied
himself
quite
as
much
to
conciliate
the
favour
of
the
parents
as
to
secure
the
attachment
of
penny
palfrey
had
not
been
inaccessible
to
flattery
and
her
husband
being
also
of
mortal
mould
would
not
it
might
be
hoped
be
proof
against
rum
that
very
fine
jamaica
rum
of
which
mr
freely
expected
always
to
have
a
supply
sent
him
from
jamaica
it
was
not
easy
to
get
palfrey
into
the
parlour
behind
the
shop
where
a
mild
light
fell
on
the
features
of
the
heroic
admiral
but
by
getting
hold
of
him
rather
late
one
evening
as
he
was
about
to
return
home
from
grimworth
the
aspiring
lover
succeeded
in
persuading
him
to
sup
on
some
collared
beef
which
after
palfrey
brawn
he
would
find
the
very
best
of
cold
eating
from
that
hour
mr
freely
felt
sure
of
success
being
in
privacy
with
an
estimable
man
old
enough
to
be
his
father
and
being
rather
lonely
in
the
world
it
was
natural
he
should
unbosom
himself
a
little
on
subjects
which
he
could
not
speak
of
in
a
mixed
circle
especially
concerning
his
expectations
from
his
uncle
in
jamaica
who
had
no
children
and
loved
his
nephew
edward
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
though
he
had
been
so
hurt
at
his
leaving
jamaica
that
he
had
threatened
to
cut
him
off
with
a
shilling
however
he
had
since
written
to
state
his
full
forgiveness
and
though
he
was
an
eccentric
old
gentleman
and
could
not
bear
to
give
away
money
during
his
life
edward
freely
could
show
palfrey
the
letter
which
declared
plainly
enough
who
would
be
the
affectionate
uncle
heir
palfrey
actually
saw
the
letter
and
could
not
help
admiring
the
spirit
of
the
nephew
who
declared
that
such
brilliant
hopes
as
these
made
no
difference
to
his
conduct
he
should
work
at
his
humble
business
and
make
his
modest
fortune
at
it
all
the
same
if
the
jamaica
estate
was
to
come
to
him
well
and
good
it
was
nothing
very
surprising
for
one
of
the
freely
family
to
have
an
estate
left
him
considering
the
lands
that
family
had
possessed
in
time
gone
by
nay
still
possessed
in
the
northumberland
branch
would
not
palfrey
take
another
glass
of
rum
and
also
look
at
the
last
balance
of
the
accounts
mr
freely
was
a
man
who
cared
to
possess
personal
virtues
and
did
not
pique
himself
on
his
family
though
some
men
would
we
know
how
easily
the
great
leviathan
may
be
led
when
once
there
is
a
hook
in
his
nose
or
a
bridle
in
his
jaws
palfrey
was
a
large
man
but
like
leviathan
his
bulk
went
against
him
when
once
he
had
taken
a
turning
he
was
not
a
mercurial
man
who
easily
changed
his
point
of
view
enough
before
two
months
were
over
he
had
given
his
consent
to
mr
freely
marriage
with
his
daughter
penny
and
having
hit
on
a
formula
by
which
he
could
justify
it
fenced
off
all
doubts
and
objections
his
own
included
the
formula
was
this
i
not
a
man
to
put
my
head
up
an
entry
before
i
know
where
it
leads
little
penny
was
very
proud
and
fluttering
but
hardly
so
happy
as
she
expected
to
be
in
an
engagement
she
wondered
if
young
towers
cared
much
about
it
for
he
had
not
been
to
the
house
lately
and
her
sister
and
brothers
were
rather
inclined
to
sneer
than
to
sympathize
grimworth
rang
with
the
news
all
men
extolled
mr
freely
good
fortune
while
the
women
with
the
tender
solicitude
characteristic
of
the
sex
wished
the
marriage
might
turn
out
well
while
affairs
were
at
this
triumphant
juncture
mr
freely
one
morning
observed
that
a
who
had
been
breakfasting
in
the
had
left
a
newspaper
behind
it
was
the
and
being
a
county
not
unknown
to
mr
freely
he
felt
some
curiosity
to
glance
over
it
and
especially
over
the
advertisements
a
slight
flush
came
over
his
face
as
he
read
it
was
produced
by
the
following
announcement
if
david
faux
son
of
jonathan
faux
late
of
gilsbrook
will
apply
at
the
office
of
strutt
attorney
of
rodham
he
will
hear
of
something
to
his
advantage
father
dead
exclaimed
mr
freely
involuntarily
can
he
have
left
me
a
legacy
chapter
iii
perhaps
it
was
a
result
quite
different
from
your
expectations
that
david
faux
should
have
returned
from
the
west
indies
only
a
few
years
after
his
arrival
there
and
have
set
up
in
his
old
business
like
any
plain
man
who
has
never
travelled
but
these
cases
do
occur
in
life
since
as
we
know
men
change
their
skies
and
see
new
constellations
without
changing
their
souls
it
will
follow
sometimes
that
they
change
their
business
under
those
novel
circumstances
certainly
this
result
was
contrary
to
david
own
expectations
he
had
looked
forward
you
are
aware
to
a
brilliant
career
among
the
blacks
but
either
because
they
had
already
seen
too
many
white
men
or
for
some
other
reason
they
did
not
at
once
recognize
him
as
a
superior
order
of
human
being
besides
there
were
no
princesses
among
them
nobody
in
jamaica
was
anxious
to
maintain
david
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
his
society
and
those
hidden
merits
of
a
man
which
are
so
well
known
to
himself
were
as
little
recognized
there
as
they
notoriously
are
in
the
effete
society
of
the
old
world
so
that
in
the
dark
hints
that
david
threw
out
at
the
oyster
club
about
that
life
of
sultanic
spent
by
him
in
the
luxurious
indies
i
really
think
he
was
doing
himself
a
wrong
i
believe
he
worked
for
his
bread
and
in
fact
took
to
cooking
as
after
all
the
only
department
in
which
he
could
offer
skilled
labour
he
had
formed
several
ingenious
plans
by
which
he
meant
to
circumvent
people
of
large
fortune
and
small
faculty
but
then
he
never
met
with
exactly
the
right
circumstances
david
devices
for
getting
rich
without
work
had
apparently
no
direct
relation
with
the
world
outside
him
as
his
confectionery
receipts
had
it
is
possible
to
pass
a
great
many
bad
half
pennies
and
bad
but
i
believe
there
has
no
instance
been
known
of
passing
a
halfpenny
or
a
as
a
sovereign
a
sharper
can
drive
a
brisk
trade
in
this
world
it
is
undeniable
that
there
may
be
a
fine
career
for
him
if
he
will
dare
consequences
but
david
was
too
timid
to
be
a
sharper
or
venture
in
any
way
among
the
mantraps
of
the
law
he
dared
rob
nobody
but
his
mother
and
so
he
had
to
fall
back
on
the
genuine
value
there
was
in
him
to
be
content
to
pass
as
a
good
halfpenny
or
to
speak
more
accurately
as
a
good
confectioner
for
in
spite
of
some
additional
reading
and
observation
there
was
nothing
else
he
could
make
so
much
money
by
nay
he
found
in
himself
even
a
capability
of
extending
his
skill
in
this
direction
and
embracing
all
forms
of
cookery
while
in
other
branches
of
human
labour
he
began
to
see
that
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
shine
fate
was
too
strong
for
him
he
had
thought
to
master
her
inclination
and
had
fled
over
the
seas
to
that
end
but
she
caught
him
tied
an
apron
round
him
and
snatching
him
from
all
other
devices
made
him
devise
cakes
and
patties
in
a
kitchen
at
kingstown
he
was
getting
submissive
to
her
since
she
paid
him
with
tolerable
gains
but
fevers
and
prickly
heat
and
other
evils
incidental
to
cooks
in
ardent
climates
made
him
long
for
his
native
land
so
he
took
ship
once
more
carrying
his
six
years
savings
and
seeing
distinctly
this
time
what
were
fate
intentions
as
to
his
career
if
you
question
me
closely
as
to
whether
all
the
money
with
which
he
set
up
at
grimworth
consisted
of
pure
and
simple
earnings
i
am
obliged
to
confess
that
he
got
a
sum
or
two
for
charitably
abstaining
from
mentioning
some
other
people
misdemeanours
altogether
since
no
prospects
were
attached
to
his
family
name
and
since
a
new
christening
seemed
a
suitable
commencement
of
a
new
life
david
faux
thought
it
as
well
to
call
himself
edward
freely
but
lo
now
in
opposition
to
all
calculable
probability
some
benefit
appeared
to
be
attached
to
the
name
of
david
faux
should
he
neglect
it
as
beneath
the
attention
of
a
prosperous
tradesman
it
might
bring
him
into
contact
with
his
family
again
and
he
felt
no
yearnings
in
that
direction
moreover
he
had
small
belief
that
the
something
to
his
advantage
could
be
anything
considerable
on
the
other
hand
even
a
small
gain
is
pleasant
and
the
promise
of
it
in
this
instance
was
so
surprising
that
david
felt
his
curiosity
awakened
the
scale
dipped
at
last
on
the
side
of
writing
to
the
lawyer
and
to
be
brief
the
correspondence
ended
in
an
appointment
for
a
meeting
between
david
and
his
eldest
brother
at
strutt
the
vague
something
having
been
defined
as
a
legacy
from
his
father
of
pounds
three
shillings
david
you
know
had
expected
to
be
disinherited
and
so
he
would
have
been
if
he
had
not
like
some
other
indifferent
sons
come
of
excellent
parents
whose
conscience
made
them
scrupulous
where
much
more
instructed
people
often
feel
themselves
warranted
in
following
the
bent
of
their
indignation
good
faux
could
never
forget
that
she
had
brought
this
son
into
the
world
when
he
was
in
that
entirely
helpless
state
which
excluded
the
smallest
choice
on
his
part
and
somehow
or
other
she
felt
that
his
going
wrong
would
be
his
father
and
mother
fault
if
they
failed
in
one
tittle
of
their
parental
duty
her
notion
of
parental
duty
was
not
of
a
high
and
subtle
kind
but
it
included
giving
him
his
due
share
of
the
family
property
for
when
a
man
had
got
a
little
honest
money
of
his
own
was
he
so
likely
to
steal
to
cut
the
delinquent
son
off
with
a
shilling
was
like
delivering
him
over
to
his
evil
propensities
no
let
the
sum
of
twenty
guineas
which
he
had
stolen
be
deducted
from
his
share
and
then
let
the
sum
of
three
guineas
be
put
back
from
it
seeing
that
his
mother
had
always
considered
three
of
the
twenty
guineas
as
his
and
though
he
had
run
away
and
was
perhaps
gone
across
the
sea
let
the
money
be
left
to
him
all
the
same
and
be
kept
in
reserve
for
his
possible
return
faux
agreed
to
his
wife
views
and
made
a
codicil
to
his
will
accordingly
in
time
to
die
with
a
clear
conscience
but
for
some
time
his
family
thought
it
likely
that
david
would
never
reappear
and
the
eldest
son
who
had
the
charge
of
jacob
on
his
hands
often
thought
it
a
little
hard
that
david
might
perhaps
be
dead
and
yet
for
want
of
certitude
on
that
point
his
legacy
could
not
fall
to
his
legal
heir
but
in
this
state
of
things
the
opposite
certitude
namely
that
david
was
still
alive
and
in
england
seemed
to
be
brought
by
the
testimony
of
a
neighbour
who
having
been
on
a
journey
to
cattelton
was
pretty
sure
he
had
seen
david
in
a
gig
with
a
stout
man
driving
by
his
side
he
could
swear
it
was
david
though
he
could
give
no
account
why
for
he
had
no
marks
on
him
but
no
more
had
a
white
dog
and
that
did
hinder
folks
from
knowing
a
white
dog
it
was
this
incident
which
had
led
to
the
advertisement
the
legacy
was
paid
of
course
after
a
few
preliminary
disclosures
as
to
david
actual
position
he
begged
to
send
his
love
to
his
mother
and
to
say
that
he
hoped
to
pay
her
a
dutiful
visit
by
and
by
but
at
present
his
business
and
near
prospect
of
marriage
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
leave
home
his
brother
replied
with
much
frankness
my
mother
may
do
as
she
likes
about
having
you
to
see
her
but
for
my
part
i
do
want
to
catch
sight
of
you
on
the
premises
again
when
folks
have
taken
a
new
name
they
better
keep
to
their
new
david
pocketed
the
insult
along
with
the
pounds
three
and
travelled
home
again
in
some
triumph
at
the
ease
of
a
transaction
which
had
enriched
him
to
this
extent
he
had
no
intention
of
offending
his
brother
by
further
claims
on
his
fraternal
recognition
and
relapsed
with
full
contentment
into
the
character
of
edward
freely
the
orphan
scion
of
a
great
but
reduced
family
with
an
eccentric
uncle
in
the
west
indies
i
have
already
hinted
that
he
had
some
acquaintance
with
imaginative
literature
and
being
of
a
practical
turn
he
had
you
perceive
applied
even
this
form
of
knowledge
to
practical
purposes
it
was
little
more
than
a
week
after
the
return
from
his
fruitful
journey
that
the
day
of
his
marriage
with
penny
having
been
fixed
it
was
agreed
that
palfrey
should
overcome
her
reluctance
to
move
from
home
and
that
she
and
her
husband
should
bring
their
two
daughters
to
inspect
little
penny
future
abode
and
decide
on
the
new
arrangements
to
be
made
for
the
reception
of
the
bride
mr
freely
meant
her
to
have
a
house
so
pretty
and
comfortable
that
she
need
not
envy
even
a
wife
of
course
the
upper
room
over
the
shop
was
to
be
the
best
but
also
the
parlour
behind
the
shop
was
to
be
made
a
suitable
bower
for
the
lovely
penny
who
would
naturally
wish
to
be
near
her
husband
though
mr
freely
declared
his
resolution
never
to
allow
wife
to
wait
in
the
shop
the
decisions
about
the
parlour
furniture
were
left
till
last
because
the
party
was
to
take
tea
there
and
about
five
they
were
all
seated
there
with
the
best
muffins
and
buttered
buns
before
them
little
penny
blushing
and
smiling
with
her
crop
in
the
best
order
and
a
blue
frock
showing
her
little
white
shoulders
while
her
opinion
was
being
always
asked
and
never
given
she
secretly
wished
to
have
a
particular
sort
of
chimney
ornaments
but
she
could
not
have
brought
herself
to
mention
it
seated
by
the
side
of
her
yellow
and
rather
withered
lover
who
though
he
had
not
reached
his
thirtieth
year
had
already
about
his
eyes
she
was
quite
tremulous
at
the
greatness
of
her
lot
in
being
married
to
a
man
who
had
travelled
so
much
and
before
her
sister
letty
the
handsome
letitia
looked
rather
proud
and
contemptuous
thought
her
nature
an
odious
person
and
was
vexed
with
her
father
and
mother
for
letting
penny
marry
him
dear
little
penny
she
certainly
did
look
like
a
fresh
cherry
going
to
be
bitten
off
the
stem
by
that
lipless
mouth
would
no
deliverer
come
to
make
a
slip
between
that
cherry
and
that
mouth
without
a
lip
quite
a
family
likeness
between
the
admiral
and
you
mr
freely
observed
palfrey
who
was
looking
at
the
family
portrait
for
the
first
time
it
wonderful
and
only
a
do
you
feature
the
rest
of
your
family
as
you
know
of
i
ca
say
said
mr
freely
with
a
sigh
my
family
have
mostly
thought
themselves
too
high
to
take
any
notice
of
me
at
this
moment
an
extraordinary
disturbance
was
heard
in
the
shop
as
of
a
heavy
animal
stamping
about
and
making
angry
noises
and
then
of
a
glass
vessel
falling
in
shivers
while
the
voice
of
the
apprentice
was
heard
calling
master
in
great
alarm
mr
freely
rose
in
anxious
astonishment
and
hastened
into
the
shop
followed
by
the
four
palfreys
who
made
a
group
at
the
transfixed
with
wonder
at
seeing
a
large
man
in
a
with
a
pitchfork
in
his
hand
rush
up
to
mr
freely
and
hug
him
crying
out
zavy
zavy
zavy
it
was
jacob
and
for
some
moments
david
lost
all
presence
of
mind
he
felt
arrested
for
having
stolen
his
mother
guineas
he
turned
cold
and
trembled
in
his
brother
grasp
why
how
this
said
palfrey
advancing
from
the
door
who
is
he
jacob
supplied
the
answer
by
saying
over
and
over
again
zacob
zacob
come
zee
zavy
till
hunger
prompted
him
to
relax
his
grasp
and
to
seize
a
large
raised
pie
which
he
lifted
to
his
mouth
by
this
time
david
power
of
device
had
begun
to
return
but
it
was
a
very
hard
task
for
his
prudence
to
master
his
rage
and
hatred
towards
poor
jacob
i
do
know
who
he
is
he
must
be
drunk
he
said
in
a
low
tone
to
palfrey
but
he
dangerous
with
that
pitchfork
he
never
let
it
go
then
checking
himself
on
the
point
of
betraying
too
great
an
intimacy
with
jacob
habits
he
added
you
watch
him
while
i
run
for
the
constable
and
he
hurried
out
of
the
shop
why
where
do
you
come
from
my
man
said
palfrey
speaking
to
jacob
in
a
conciliatory
tone
jacob
was
eating
his
pie
by
large
mouthfuls
and
looking
round
at
the
other
good
things
in
the
shop
while
he
embraced
his
pitchfork
with
his
left
arm
and
laid
his
left
hand
on
some
bath
buns
he
was
in
the
rare
position
of
a
person
who
recovers
a
long
absent
friend
and
finds
him
richer
than
ever
in
the
characteristics
that
won
his
heart
i
zacob
zacob
home
i
love
zavy
zavy
he
said
as
soon
as
palfrey
had
drawn
his
attention
zavy
come
back
from
indies
got
mother
zinnies
where
zavy
he
added
looking
round
and
then
turning
to
the
others
with
a
questioning
air
puzzled
by
disappearance
it
very
odd
observed
palfrey
to
his
wife
and
daughters
he
seems
to
say
freely
his
brother
come
back
from
th
indies
what
a
pleasant
relation
for
us
said
letitia
sarcastically
i
think
he
a
good
deal
like
mr
freely
he
got
just
the
same
sort
of
nose
and
his
eyes
are
the
same
colour
poor
penny
was
ready
to
cry
but
now
mr
freely
the
shop
without
the
constable
during
his
walk
of
a
few
yards
he
had
had
time
and
calmness
enough
to
widen
his
view
of
consequences
and
he
saw
that
to
get
jacob
taken
to
the
workhouse
or
to
the
house
as
an
offensive
stranger
might
have
awkward
effects
if
his
family
took
the
trouble
of
inquiring
after
him
he
must
resign
himself
to
more
patient
measures
on
second
thoughts
he
said
beckoning
to
palfrey
and
whispering
to
him
while
jacob
back
was
turned
he
a
poor
fellow
perhaps
his
friends
will
come
after
him
i
do
mind
giving
him
something
to
eat
and
letting
him
lie
down
for
the
night
he
got
it
into
his
head
that
he
knows
me
they
do
get
these
fancies
idiots
do
he
perhaps
go
away
again
in
an
hour
or
two
and
make
no
more
ado
a
man
i
should
like
to
have
the
poor
fellow
used
why
he
eat
a
sovereign
worth
in
no
time
said
palfrey
thinking
mr
freely
a
little
too
magnificent
in
his
generosity
eh
zavy
come
back
exclaimed
jacob
giving
his
dear
brother
another
hug
which
crushed
mr
freely
features
inconveniently
against
the
stale
of
the
pitchfork
aye
aye
said
mr
freely
smiling
with
every
capability
of
murder
in
his
mind
except
the
courage
to
commit
it
he
wished
the
bath
buns
might
by
chance
have
arsenic
in
them
mother
zinnies
said
jacob
pointing
to
a
glass
jar
of
yellow
lozenges
that
stood
in
the
window
zive
me
david
dared
not
do
otherwise
than
reach
down
the
glass
jar
and
give
jacob
a
handful
he
received
them
in
his
which
he
held
out
for
more
they
keep
him
quiet
a
bit
at
any
rate
thought
david
and
emptied
the
jar
jacob
grinned
and
mowed
with
delight
you
very
good
to
this
stranger
mr
freely
said
letitia
and
then
spitefully
as
david
joined
the
party
at
the
i
think
you
could
hardly
treat
him
better
if
he
was
really
your
brother
i
always
thought
it
a
duty
to
be
good
to
idiots
said
mr
freely
striving
after
the
most
moral
view
of
the
subject
we
might
have
been
idiots
ourselves
everybody
might
have
been
born
idiots
instead
of
having
their
right
senses
i
do
know
where
there
ha
been
victual
for
us
all
then
observed
palfrey
regarding
the
matter
in
a
housewifely
light
but
let
us
sit
down
again
and
finish
our
tea
said
mr
freely
let
us
leave
the
poor
creature
to
himself
they
walked
into
the
parlour
again
but
jacob
not
apparently
appreciating
the
kindness
of
leaving
him
to
himself
immediately
followed
his
brother
and
seated
himself
pitchfork
grounded
at
the
table
well
said
miss
letitia
rising
i
do
know
whether
mean
to
stay
mother
but
i
shall
go
home
oh
me
too
said
penny
frightened
to
death
at
jacob
who
had
begun
to
nod
and
grin
at
her
well
i
think
we
better
be
going
palfrey
said
the
mother
rising
more
slowly
mr
freely
whose
complexion
had
become
decidedly
yellower
during
the
last
did
not
resist
this
proposition
he
hoped
they
should
meet
again
under
happier
circumstances
it
my
belief
the
man
is
his
brother
said
letitia
when
they
were
all
on
their
way
home
nonsense
said
palfrey
freely
got
no
brother
he
said
so
many
and
many
a
time
he
an
orphan
he
got
nothing
but
uncles
leastwise
one
what
it
matter
what
an
idiot
says
what
call
had
freely
to
tell
lies
letitia
tossed
her
head
and
was
silent
mr
freely
left
alone
with
his
affectionate
brother
jacob
brooded
over
the
possibility
of
luring
him
out
of
the
town
early
the
next
morning
and
getting
him
conveyed
to
gilsbrook
without
further
betrayals
but
the
thing
was
difficult
he
saw
clearly
that
if
he
took
jacob
himself
his
absence
conjoined
with
the
disappearance
of
the
stranger
would
either
cause
the
conviction
that
he
was
really
a
relative
or
would
oblige
him
to
the
dangerous
course
of
inventing
a
story
to
account
for
his
disappearance
and
his
own
absence
at
the
same
time
david
groaned
there
come
occasions
when
falsehood
is
felt
to
be
inconvenient
it
would
perhaps
have
been
a
device
if
he
had
never
told
any
of
those
clever
fibs
about
his
uncles
grand
and
otherwise
for
the
palfreys
were
simple
people
and
shared
the
popular
prejudice
against
lying
even
if
he
could
get
jacob
away
this
time
what
security
was
there
that
he
would
not
come
again
having
once
found
the
way
o
guineas
o
lozenges
what
enviable
people
those
were
who
had
never
robbed
their
mothers
and
had
never
told
fibs
david
spent
a
sleepless
night
while
jacob
was
snoring
close
by
was
this
the
upshot
of
travelling
to
the
indies
and
acquiring
experience
combined
with
anecdote
he
rose
at
break
of
day
as
he
had
once
before
done
when
he
was
in
fear
of
jacob
and
took
all
gentle
means
to
rouse
this
fatal
brother
from
his
deep
sleep
he
dared
not
be
loud
because
his
apprentice
was
in
the
house
and
would
report
everything
but
jacob
was
not
to
be
roused
he
fought
out
with
his
fist
at
the
unknown
cause
of
disturbance
turned
over
and
snored
again
he
must
be
left
to
wake
as
he
would
david
with
a
cold
perspiration
on
his
brow
confessed
to
himself
that
jacob
could
not
be
got
away
that
day
palfrey
came
over
to
grimworth
before
noon
with
a
natural
curiosity
to
see
how
his
future
got
on
with
the
stranger
to
whom
he
was
so
benevolently
inclined
he
found
a
crowd
round
the
shop
all
grimworth
by
this
time
had
heard
how
freely
had
been
fastened
on
by
an
idiot
who
called
him
brother
zavy
and
the
younger
population
seemed
to
find
the
singular
stranger
an
unwearying
source
of
fascination
while
the
householders
dropped
in
one
by
one
to
inquire
into
the
incident
why
do
you
send
him
to
the
workhouse
said
prettyman
have
a
row
with
him
and
the
children
presently
and
he
eat
you
up
the
workhouse
is
the
proper
place
for
him
let
his
kin
claim
him
if
he
got
any
those
may
be
feelings
prettyman
said
david
his
mind
quite
enfeebled
by
the
torture
of
his
position
what
he
your
brother
then
said
prettyman
looking
at
his
neighbour
freely
rather
sharply
all
men
are
our
brothers
and
idiots
particular
so
said
mr
freely
who
like
many
other
travelled
men
was
not
master
of
the
english
language
come
come
if
he
your
brother
tell
the
truth
man
said
prettyman
with
growing
suspicion
do
be
ashamed
of
your
own
flesh
and
blood
palfrey
was
present
and
also
had
his
eye
on
freely
it
is
difficult
for
a
man
to
believe
in
the
advantage
of
a
truth
which
will
disclose
him
to
have
been
a
liar
in
this
critical
moment
david
shrank
from
this
immediate
disgrace
in
the
eyes
of
his
future
prettyman
he
said
i
take
your
observations
as
an
insult
no
reason
to
be
otherwise
than
proud
of
my
own
flesh
and
blood
if
this
poor
man
was
my
brother
more
than
all
men
are
i
should
say
so
a
tall
figure
darkened
the
door
and
david
lifting
his
eyes
in
that
direction
saw
his
eldest
brother
jonathan
on
the
i
stay
wi
zavy
shouted
jacob
as
he
too
caught
sight
of
his
eldest
brother
and
running
behind
the
counter
he
clutched
david
hard
what
he
here
said
jonathan
faux
coming
forward
my
mother
would
have
no
nay
as
he
been
away
so
long
but
i
must
see
after
him
and
it
struck
me
he
was
very
like
come
after
you
because
we
been
talking
of
you
o
late
and
where
you
lived
david
saw
there
was
no
escape
he
smiled
a
ghastly
smile
what
is
this
a
relation
of
yours
sir
said
palfrey
to
jonathan
aye
it
my
innicent
of
a
brother
sure
enough
said
honest
jonathan
a
fine
trouble
and
cost
he
is
to
us
in
th
eating
and
other
things
but
we
must
bear
what
laid
on
us
and
your
name
freely
is
it
said
prettyman
nay
nay
my
name
faux
i
know
nothing
o
freelys
said
jonathan
curtly
come
he
added
turning
to
david
i
must
take
some
news
to
mother
about
jacob
shall
i
take
him
with
me
or
will
you
undertake
to
send
him
back
take
him
if
you
can
make
him
loose
his
hold
of
me
said
david
feebly
is
this
gentleman
here
in
the
confectionery
line
your
brother
then
sir
said
prettyman
feeling
that
it
was
an
occasion
on
which
formal
language
must
be
used
do
want
to
own
him
said
jonathan
unable
to
resist
a
movement
of
indignation
that
had
never
been
allowed
to
satisfy
itself
he
ran
away
from
home
with
good
reasons
in
his
pocket
years
ago
he
did
want
to
be
owned
again
i
reckon
palfrey
left
the
shop
he
felt
his
own
pride
too
severely
wounded
by
the
sense
that
he
had
let
himself
be
fooled
to
feel
curiosity
for
further
details
the
most
pressing
business
was
to
go
home
and
tell
his
daughter
that
freely
was
a
poor
sneak
probably
a
rascal
and
that
her
engagement
was
broken
off
prettyman
stayed
with
some
internal
that
had
never
given
in
to
freely
and
that
chaloner
would
see
now
what
sort
of
fellow
it
was
that
he
had
put
over
the
heads
of
older
parishioners
he
considered
it
due
from
him
prettyman
that
for
the
interests
of
the
parish
he
should
know
all
that
was
to
be
known
about
this
interloper
grimworth
would
have
people
coming
from
botany
bay
to
settle
in
it
if
things
went
on
in
this
way
it
soon
appeared
that
jacob
could
not
be
made
to
quit
his
dear
brother
david
except
by
force
he
understood
with
a
clearness
equal
to
that
of
the
most
intelligent
mind
that
jonathan
would
take
him
back
to
skimmed
milk
broad
beans
and
pork
and
he
had
found
a
paradise
in
his
brother
shop
it
was
a
difficult
matter
to
use
force
with
jacob
for
he
wore
heavy
nailed
boots
and
if
his
pitchfork
had
been
mastered
he
would
have
resorted
without
hesitation
to
kicks
nothing
short
of
using
guile
to
bind
him
hand
and
foot
would
have
made
all
parties
safe
let
him
stay
said
david
with
desperate
resignation
frightened
above
all
things
at
the
idea
of
further
disturbances
in
his
shop
which
would
make
his
exposure
all
the
more
conspicuous
go
away
again
and
morrow
i
can
perhaps
get
him
to
go
to
gilsbrook
with
me
he
follow
me
fast
enough
i
daresay
he
added
with
a
very
well
said
jonathan
gruffly
i
do
see
why
have
some
trouble
and
expense
with
him
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
but
mind
you
bring
him
back
safe
and
soon
else
mother
never
rest
on
this
arrangement
being
concluded
prettyman
begged
jonathan
faux
to
go
and
take
a
snack
with
him
an
invitation
which
was
quite
acceptable
and
as
honest
jonathan
had
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
it
is
probable
that
he
was
very
frank
in
his
communications
to
the
civil
draper
who
pursuing
the
benefit
of
the
parish
hastened
to
make
all
the
information
he
could
gather
about
freely
common
parochial
property
you
may
imagine
that
the
meeting
of
the
club
at
the
woolpack
that
evening
was
unusually
lively
every
member
was
anxious
to
prove
that
he
had
never
liked
freely
as
he
called
himself
faux
was
his
name
was
it
fox
would
have
been
more
suitable
the
majority
expressed
a
desire
to
see
him
hooted
out
of
the
town
mr
freely
did
not
venture
over
his
that
day
for
he
knew
jacob
would
keep
at
his
side
and
there
was
every
probability
that
they
would
have
a
train
of
juvenile
followers
he
sent
to
engage
the
woolpack
gig
for
an
early
hour
the
next
morning
but
this
order
was
not
kept
religiously
a
secret
by
the
landlord
mr
freely
was
informed
that
he
could
not
have
the
gig
till
seven
and
the
grimworth
people
were
early
risers
perhaps
they
were
more
alert
than
usual
on
this
particular
morning
for
when
jacob
with
a
bag
of
sweets
in
his
hand
was
induced
to
mount
the
gig
with
his
brother
david
the
inhabitants
of
the
were
looking
out
of
their
doors
and
windows
and
at
the
turning
of
the
street
there
was
even
a
muster
of
apprentices
and
schoolboys
who
shouted
as
they
passed
in
what
jacob
took
to
be
a
very
merry
and
friendly
way
nodding
and
grinning
in
return
huzzay
david
faux
how
your
uncle
was
their
morning
greeting
like
other
pointed
things
it
was
not
altogether
impromptu
even
this
public
derision
was
not
so
crushing
to
david
as
the
horrible
thought
that
though
he
might
succeed
now
in
getting
jacob
home
again
there
would
never
be
any
security
against
his
coming
back
like
a
wasp
to
the
as
long
as
david
lived
at
grimworth
jacob
return
would
be
hanging
over
him
but
could
he
go
on
living
at
grimworth
an
object
of
ridicule
discarded
by
the
palfreys
after
having
revelled
in
the
consciousness
that
he
was
an
envied
and
prosperous
confectioner
david
liked
to
be
envied
he
minded
less
about
being
loved
his
doubts
on
this
point
were
soon
settled
the
mind
of
grimworth
became
obstinately
set
against
him
and
his
viands
and
the
new
school
being
finished
the
was
closed
if
there
had
been
no
other
reason
sympathy
with
the
palfreys
that
respectable
family
who
had
lived
in
the
parish
time
out
of
mind
would
have
determined
all
people
to
decline
freely
goods
besides
he
had
absconded
with
his
guineas
who
knew
what
else
he
had
done
in
jamaica
or
elsewhere
before
he
came
to
grimworth
worming
himself
into
families
under
false
pretences
females
shuddered
dreadful
suspicions
gathered
round
him
his
green
eyes
his
had
a
criminal
aspect
the
rector
disliked
the
sight
of
a
man
who
had
imposed
upon
him
and
all
boys
who
could
not
afford
to
purchase
hooted
david
faux
as
they
passed
his
shop
certainly
no
man
now
would
pay
anything
for
the
goodwill
of
mr
freely
business
and
he
would
be
obliged
to
quit
it
without
a
peculium
so
desirable
towards
defraying
the
expense
of
moving
in
a
few
months
the
shop
in
the
was
again
to
let
and
david
faux
alias
edward
freely
had
gone
nobody
at
grimworth
knew
whither
in
this
way
the
demoralization
of
grimworth
women
was
checked
young
steene
renewed
her
efforts
to
make
light
and
having
at
last
made
a
batch
so
excellent
that
steene
looked
at
her
with
complacency
as
he
ate
them
and
said
they
were
the
best
he
had
ever
eaten
in
his
life
she
thought
less
of
bulbuls
and
renegades
ever
after
the
secrets
of
the
finer
cookery
were
revived
in
the
breasts
of
matronly
and
daughters
were
again
anxious
to
be
initiated
in
them
you
will
further
i
hope
be
glad
to
hear
that
some
purchases
of
drapery
made
by
pretty
penny
in
preparation
for
her
marriage
with
mr
freely
came
in
quite
as
well
for
her
wedding
with
young
towers
as
if
they
had
been
made
expressly
for
the
latter
occasion
for
penny
complexion
had
not
altered
and
blue
always
became
it
best
here
ends
the
story
of
david
faux
confectioner
and
his
brother
jacob
and
we
see
in
it
i
think
an
admirable
instance
of
the
unexpected
forms
in
which
the
great
nemesis
hides
herself
