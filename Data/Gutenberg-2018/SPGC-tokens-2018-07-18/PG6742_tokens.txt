a
comedy

acts
original
in
introductory
notice
school
for
was
the
first
play
in
the
title
of
which
the
word
school
was
employed
to
imply
that
over
and
above
the
intention
of
amusing
the
author
designed
to
convey
a
special
lesson
to
his
hearers
perhaps
molière
wished
not
only
that
the
general
public
should
be
prepared
to
find
instructions
and
warnings
for
married
men
but
also
that
they
who
were
wont
to
regard
the
theatre
as
injurious
or
at
best
trivial
should
know
that
he
professed
to
educate
as
well
as
to
entertain
we
must
count
the
adoption
of
similar
titles
by
sheridan
and
others
amongst
the
tributes
by
imitation
to
molière
genius
this
comedy
was
played
for
the
first
time
at
paris
on
the
of
june
and
met
with
great
success
on
the
of
july
following
it
was
acted
at
vaux
the
country
seat
of
fouquet
before
the
whole
court
monsieur
the
brother
of
the
king
and
the
queen
of
england
and
by
them
also
was
much
approved
some
commentators
say
that
molière
was
partly
inspired
by
a
comedy
of
lope
de
vega
discreta
the
cunning
sweetheart
also
by
a
remodelling
of
the
same
play
by
moreto
puede
ser
guardar
una
one
can
not
guard
a
woman
but
this
has
lately
been
disproved
it
appears
however
that
he
borrowed
the
primary
idea
of
his
comedy
from
the
of
terence
and
from
a
tale
the
third
of
the
third
day
in
the
decameron
of
boccaccio
where
a
young
woman
uses
her
as
a
for
herself
and
her
lover
in
the
there
are
two
old
men
of
dissimilar
character
who
give
a
different
education
to
the
children
they
bring
up
one
of
them
is
a
dotard
who
after
having
for
sixty
years
been
sullen
grumpy
and
avaricious
becomes
suddenly
lively
polite
and
prodigal
this
molière
had
too
much
common
sense
to
imitate
school
for
marks
a
distinct
departure
in
the
dramatist
literary
progress
as
a
critic
has
well
observed
it
substitutes
for
situations
produced
by
the
mechanism
of
plot
characters
which
give
rise
to
situations
in
accordance
with
the
ordinary
operations
of
human
nature
molière
method
the
simple
and
only
true
one
and
consequently
the
one
which
incontestably
establishes
the
original
talent
of
its
employer
is
this
at
the
beginning
of
a
play
he
introduces
his
principal
personages
sets
them
talking
suffers
them
to
betray
their
characters
as
men
and
women
do
in
life
expecting
from
his
hearers
that
same
discernment
which
he
has
himself
displayed
in
detecting
their
peculiarities
imports
the
germ
of
a
plot
in
some
slight
misunderstanding
or
equivocal
act
and
leaves
all
the
rest
to
be
effected
by
the
action
and
reaction
of
the
characters
which
he
began
by
bringing
out
in
bold
relief
his
plots
are
thus
the
plots
of
nature
and
it
is
impossible
that
they
should
not
be
both
interesting
and
instructive
that
his
comedies
thus
composed
are
besides
amusing
results
from
the
shrewdness
with
which
he
has
selected
and
combined
his
characters
and
the
art
with
which
he
arranges
the
situations
produced
the
of
molière
exhibit
more
than
any
others
the
force
of
his
natural
genius
and
the
comparative
weakness
of
his
artistic
talent
in
the
exhibition
and
the
evolution
of
character
he
is
supreme
in
the
unravelling
of
his
plots
and
the
of
his
situations
he
is
driven
too
willingly
to
the
ex
school
for
was
directed
against
one
of
the
special
and
prominent
defects
of
society
in
the
age
and
country
in
which
molière
lived
domestic
tyranny
was
not
only
rife
but
it
was
manifested
in
one
of
its
coarsest
forms
sganarelle
though
twenty
years
younger
than
ariste
and
not
quite
forty
years
old
could
not
govern
by
moral
force
he
relied
solely
on
bolts
and
bars
physical
restraint
was
the
safeguard
in
which
husbands
and
parents
had
the
greatest
confidence
not
perceiving
that
the
brain
and
the
heart
are
always
able
to
prevail
against
it
this
truth
molière
took
upon
himself
to
preach
and
herein
he
surpasses
all
his
rivals
in
nothing
more
than
in
the
artistic
device
by
which
he
introduces
the
contrast
of
the
wise
and
trustful
ariste
as
he
is
called
in
french
rewarded
in
the
end
by
the
triumph
of
his
more
humane
mode
of
treatment

probably
expresses
his
own
feelings

mouth

of

married
armande
béjart
being
then
about
double
her
age
as
to
sganarelle
in
this
play
he
ceases
to
be
a
mere
buffoon
as
in
some
of
molière
farces
and
becomes
the
personification
of
an
idea
or
of
a
folly
which
has
to
be
ridiculed

to
express

that
it

follow
whatever

further

themselves

i
maintain
that
it
is
wrong
for
whatever
reasons
obstinately
to
eschew
what
every
one
observes
that
it
would
be
better
to
be

among

in

upon

strange
that
you

careful

fling
my

that

should
continually
find
you
blaming
my
dress
as
well
as
my
cheerfulness

would
imagine
that
old
age
ought
to
think
of
nothing
but
death
since
it
is
condemned
to
give
up
all
enjoyment
and
that
it
is
not
attended
by
enough
ugliness
of
its
own

must
needs
be
slovenly

crabbed

i

mistrust
would
have
on
me
though
we

she
is
not
much
of
my

if
your
daily
conduct
produces
any
love
in

indeed
all
these
precautions
are
disgraceful
are
we
in

must
be
shut
up

they
say
they

kept
like

the

are
accursed

our
honour
sir
is
very
weak
indeed
if
it
must
be
perpetually
watched
do
you
think
after
all
that
these
precautions
are
any
bar
to
our
designs

when
we
take
anything
into

the
cleverest

not

a
donkey

that

torments
us
puts
himself
in
extreme
peril
for
our
honour
must
ever
be
its
own
protector
to
take
so
much
trouble
in
preventing
us
is
almost
to
give
us
a
desire
to
sin

i
were
suspected
by
my

should
have
a
very
good

little
freedom

are

by
so
much
austerity
suspicious
precautions

win

would
scarcely
trust
my
honour

in
the
desires

might
assail
her
required
nothing
but
an
opportunity
of
falling
sgan
that
is
all
nonsense
ar
have
it
so
but
still
i
maintain
that
we

instruct

their

great
tenderness

teaches

been
followed

offends
has

understood

of
your

that
your
secret
desires
are
well
known
to
her
and
that
to
try
more
fully
to
explain
a
passion
which
is
contrary
to
the
affection
she
entertains
for
me
is
to
give
yourself
needless
trouble

she
you
say
of
her
own
accord
makes
you
sgan
yes
makes
me
come
to
you
and
give
you
this
frank
and
plain
message
also
that
having
observed
the
violent
love
wherewith
your
soul
is
smitten
she
would
earlier
have
let
you
know
what
she
thinks
about
you
if
perplexed
as
she
was
she
could
have
found
anyone
to
send
this
message
by
but
that
at
length
she
was
painfully
compelled
to
make
use
of
me
in
order
to
assure
you
as
i
have
told
you
that
her
affection
is
denied
to
all
save
me
that
you
have
been
ogling
her
long
enough
and
that
if
you
have
ever
so
little
brains
you
will
carry
your
passion
somewhere
else
farewell
till
our
next
meeting

is
what
i
had
to
tell

is
taken
aback
erg
a
low
tone
to
for
my
part
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
in
it
to
displease
you
that
a
rather
subtle
mystery
is
concealed
under
it
in
short
that
this
message
is
not
sent
by
one
who
desires
to
see
the
love
end
which
she
inspires
in
you
sgan
he
takes
it
as
he
ought
val

low
tone
to
you
think
it
a
mystery

yes
but
he
is
looking
at
us
let
us
get
out
of
his
sight
scene
sganarelle
how
his
face
showed
his
confusion
doubtless
he
did
not
expect
this
message
let
me
call
isabella
she
is
showing
the
fruits
which
education
produces
on
the
mind
virtue
is
all
she
cares
for
and
her
heart
is
so
deeply
steeped
in
it
that
she
is
offended
if
a
man
merely
looks
at
her
scene
isabella
sganarelle
isa
as
she
i
fear
that
my
lover
full
of
his
passion
has
not
understood
my
message
rightly
since
i
am
so
strictly
guarded
i
must
risk
one
which
shall
make
my
meaning
clearer
sgan
here
i
am
returned
again
isa
well
sgan
your
words
wrought
their
full
purpose
i
have
done
his
business
he
wanted
to
deny
that
his
heart
was
touched
but
when
i
told
him
i
came
from
you
he
stood
immediately
dumbfounded
and
confused
i
do
not
believe
he
will
come
here
any
more
isa
ah
what
do
you
tell
me
i
much
fear
the
contrary
and
that
he
will
still
give
us
more
trouble
sgan
and
why
do
you
fear
this
isa
you
had
hardly
left
the
house
when
going
to
the
window
to
take
a
breath
of
air
i
saw
a
young
man
at
yonder
turning
who
first
came
most
unexpectedly
to
wish
me
good
morning
on
the
part
of
this
impertinent
man
and
then
threw
right
into
my
chamber
a
box
enclosing
a
letter
sealed
like
a
footnote
the
original
has
literally
a
chicken
because
were
folded
so
as
to
represent
a
fowl
with
two
wings
this
shape
is
now
called
from
and
though
no
longer
used
to
designate
a
is
often
employed
in
familiar
phraseology
in
speaking
of
a
girl
who
does
not
lead
a
moral
life
i
meant
at
once
to
throw
it
after
him
but
he
had
already
reached
the
end
of
the
street
i
feel
very
much
annoyed
at
it
sgan
just
see
his
trickery
and
rascality
isa
it
is
my
duty
quickly
to
have
this
box
and
letter
sent
back
to
this
detestable
lover
for
that
purpose
i
need
some
one
for
i
dare
not
venture
to
ask
yourself
sgan
on
the
contrary
darling
it
shows
me
all
the
more
your
love
and
faithfulness
my
heart
joyfully
accepts
this
task
you
oblige
me
in
this
more
than
i
can
tell
you
isa
take
it
then
sgan
well
let
us
see
what
he
has
dared
to
say
to
you
isa
heavens
take
care
not
to
open
it
sgan
why
so
isa
will
you
make
him
believe
that
it
is
i
a
respectable
girl
ought
always
to
refuse
to
read
the
letters
a
man
sends
her
the
curiosity
which
she
thus
betrays
shows
a
secret
pleasure
in
listening
to
gallantries
i
think
it
right
that
this
letter
should
be
peremptorily
returned
to
valère
unopened
that
he
may
the
better
learn
this
day
the
great
contempt
which
my
heart
feels
for
him
so
that
his
passion
may
from
this
time
lose
all
hope
and
never
more
attempt
such
a
transgression
sgan
of
a
truth
she
is
right
in
this
well
your
virtue
charms
me
as
well
as
your
discretion
i
see
that
my
lessons
have
borne
fruit
in
your
mind
you
show
yourself
worthy
of
being
my
wife
isa
still
i
do
not
like
to
stand
in
the
way
of
your
wishes
the
letter
is
in
your
hands
and
you
can
open
it
sgan
no
far
from
it
your
reasons
are
too
good
i
go
to
acquit
myself
of
the
task
you
impose
upon
me
i
have
likewise
to
say
a
few
words
quite
near
and
will
then
return
hither
to
set
you
at
rest

see
if

will
no
doubt
surprise
you
both
the
resolution
to
write
to
you
and
the
means
of
conveying
it
to
your
hands
may
be
thought
very
bold
in
me
but
i
am
in
such
a
condition
that
i
can
no
longer
restrain
myself
repugnance
to
a
marriage
with
which
i
am
threatened
in
six
days
makes
me
risk
everything
and
in
the
determination
to
free
myself
from
it
by
whatever
means
i
thought
i
had
rather
choose
you
than
despair
yet
do
not
think
that
you
owe
all
to
my
evil
fate
it
is
not
the
constraint
in
which
i
find
myself
that
has
given
rise
to
the
sentiments
i
entertain
for
you
but
it
hastens
the
avowal
of
them
and
makes
me
transgress
the
decorum
which
the
proprieties
of
my
sex
require
it
depends
on
you
alone
to
make
me
shortly
your

i
wait
only
until
you
have
declared
your
intentions
to
me
before
acquainting
you
with
the
resolution
i
have
taken
but
above
all
remember
that
time
presses
and
that
two
hearts
which
love
each
other
ought
to
understand
even
the
slightest
erg
well
sir
is
not
this
contrivance
original
for
a
young

she
is
not
so
very
ignorant
would
one
have
thought
her
capable
of
these
love
stratagems
val
ah
i
consider
her
altogether
adorable
this
evidence
of
her
wit
and
tenderness
doubles
my
love
for
her
and
strengthens
the
feelings
with
which
her

inspires

flirt
eager
for
an
intrigue
and
melting
before
pretty
speeches
you
see
how
your
presents
are
received
believe
me
you
waste
your
powder
and
shot
isabella
is
a
discreet
girl
she
loves
me
and
your
love
insults
her
aim
at
some
one
else
and
be
off
val
yes
yes
your
merits
to
which
everyone
yields
are
too
great
an
obstacle
sir
though
my
passion
be
sincere
it
is
folly
to
contend
with
you
for
the
love
of
isabella
sgan
it
is
really
folly
val
be
sure
i
should
not
have
yielded
to
the
fascination
of
her
charms
could
i
have
foreseen
that
this
wretched
heart
would
find
a
rival
so
formidable
as
yourself
sgan
i
believe
it
val
now
i
know
better
than
to
hope
i
yield
to
you
sir
and
that
too
without
a
murmur
sgan
you
do
well
val
reason
will
have
it
so
for
you
shine
with
so
many
virtues
that
i
should
be
wrong
to
regard
with
an
angry
eye
the
tender
sentiments
which
isabella
entertains
for
you
sgan
of
course
val
yes
yes
i
yield
to
you
but
at
least
i
pray
you
and
it
is
the
only
favour
sir
begged
by
a
wretched
lover
of
whose
pangs
this
day
you
are
the
sole
cause
i
pray
you
i
say
to
assure
isabella
that
if
my
heart
has
been
burning
with
love
for
her
these
three
months
that
passion
is
spotless
and
has
never
fostered
a
thought
at
which
her
honour
could
be
offended
sgan
ay
val
that
relying
solely
on
my
heart
choice
my
only
design
was
to
obtain
her
for
my
wife
if
destiny
had
not
opposed
an
obstacle
to
this
pure
flame
in
you
who
captivated
her
heart
sgan
very
good
val
that
whatever
happens
she
must
not
think
that
her
charms
can
ever
be
forgotten
that
to
whatever
decrees
of
heaven
i
must
submit
my
fate
is
to
love
her
to
my
last
breath
and
that
if
anything
checks
my
pursuit
it
is
the
just
respect
i
have
for
your
merits
footnote
we
are
of
course
to
read
between
the
lines
if
there
is
anything
which
could
strengthen
my
resolution
to
save
her
it
is
the
natural
detestation
which
i
feel
for
you
sgan
that
is
wisely
spoken
i
shall
go
at
once
to
repeat
these
words
which
will
not
be
disagreeable
to
her
but
if
you
will
listen
to
me
try
to
act
so
as
to
drive
this
passion
from
your
mind
farewell
erg
the
excellent
dupe
scene
sganarelle
i
feel
a
great
pity
for
this
poor
wretch
so
full
of
affection
but
it
is
unfortunate
for
him
to
have
taken
it
into
his
head
to
try
to
storm
a
fortress
which
i
have
captured
knocks
at
his
scene
sganarelle
isabella
sgan
never
did
lover
display
so
much
grief
for
a
returned
unopened
at
last
he
loses
all
hope
and
retires
but
he
earnestly
entreated
me
to
tell
you
that
at
least
in
loving
you
he
never
fostered
a
thought
at
which
your
honour
could
be
offended
and
that
relying
solely
on
his
heart
choice
his
only
desire
was
to
obtain
you
for
a
wife
if
destiny
had
not
opposed
an
obstacle
to
his
pure
flame
through
me
who
captivated
your
heart
that
whatever
happens
you
must
not
think
that
your
charms
can
ever
be
forgotten
by
him
that
to
whatever
decrees
of
heaven
he
must
submit
his
fate
is
to
love
you
to
his
last
breath
and
that
if
anything
checks
his
pursuit
it
is
the
just
respect
he
has
for
my
merits
these
are
his
very
words
and
far
from
blaming
him
i
think
him
a
gentleman
and
i
pity
him
for
loving
you
isa
his
passion
does
not
contradict
my
secret
belief
and
his
looks
have
always
assured
me
of
its
innocence
sgan
what
do
you
say
isa
that
it
is
hard
that
you
should
so
greatly
pity
a
man
whom
i
hate
like
death
and
that
if
you
loved
me
as
much
as
you
say
you
would
feel
how
he
insults
me
by
his
addresses
sgan
but
he
did
not
know
your
inclinations
and
from
the
uprightness
of
his
intentions
his
love
does
not
deserve
isa
is
it
good
intentions
i
ask
to
try
and
carry
people
off
is
it
like
a
man
of
honour
to
form
designs
for
marrying
me
by
force
and
taking
me
out
of
your
hands
as
if
i
were
a
girl
to
live
after
such
a
disgrace
sgan
how
isa
yes
yes
i
have
been
informed
that
this
base
lover
speaks
of
carrying
me
off
by
force
for
my
part
i
can
not
tell
by
what
secret
means
he
has
learned
so
early
that
you
intend
to
marry
me
in
eight
days
footnote
in
the
letter
which
isabella
writes
to
valère
see
page
she
speaks
of
a
marriage
with
which
she
is
threatened
in
six
days
this
is
i
suppose
a
pious
fraud
to
urge
valère
to
make
haste
for
here
she
mentions
eight
days
at
the
latest
since
it
was
only
yesterday
you
told
me
so
but
they
say
that
he
intends
to
be
beforehand
with
you
and
not
let
me
unite
my
lot
to
yours
sgan
that
is
a
bad
case
isa
oh
pardon
me
he
is
eminently
a
gentleman
who
only
feels
towards
me
sgan
he
is
wrong
and
this
is
past
joking
isa
yes
your
good
nature
encourages
his
folly
if
you
had
spoken
sharply
to
him
just
now
he
would
have
feared
your
rage
and
my
resentment
for
even
since
his
letter
was
rejected
he
mentioned
this
design
which
has
shocked
me
as
i
have
been
told
his
love
retains
the
belief
that
it
is
well
received
by
me
that
i
dread
to
marry
you
whatever
people
may
think
and
should
be
rejoiced
to
see
myself
away
from
you
sgan
he
is
mad
isa
before
you
he
knows
how
to
disguise
and
his
plan
is
to
amuse
you
be
sure
the
wretch
makes
sport
of
you
by
these
fair
speeches
i
must
confess
that
i
am
very
unhappy
after
all
my
pains
to
live
honourably
and
to
repel
the
addresses
of
a
vile
seducer
i
must
be
exposed
to
his
vexatious
and
infamous
designs
against
me
sgan
there
fear
nothing
isa
for
my
part
i
tell
you
that
if
you
do
not
strongly
reprove
such
an
impudent
attempt
and
do
not
find
quickly
means
of
ridding
me
of
such
bold
persecutions
i
will
abandon
all
and
not
suffer
any
longer
the
insults
which
i
receive
from
him
sgan
do
not
be
so
troubled
my
little
wife
there
i
am
going
to
find
him
to
give
him
a
good
blowing
up
isa
tell
him
at
least
plainly
so
that
it
may
be
in
vain
for
him
to
gainsay
it
that
i
have
been
told
of
his
intentions
upon
good
authority
that
after
this
message
whatever
he
may
undertake
i
defy
him
to
surprise
me
and
lastly
that
without
wasting
any
more
sighs
or
time
he
must
know
what
are
my
feelings
for
you
that
if
he
wishes
not
to
be
the
cause
of
some
mischief
he
should
not
require
to
have
the
same
thing
told
twice
over
sgan
i
will
tell
him
what
is
right
isa
but
all
this
in
such
a
way
as
to
show
him
that
i
really
speak
seriously

sgan

enough

i

sense
you
have
been

fun

with
your
fine
speeches

secretly
nourish
silly
expectations
look
you

wished
to
treat
you
gently

you
will
end
by
making
me
very
angry

you
not
ashamed

who
you
are

you
do

carry
off

respectable

interrupt

her
whole
happiness
depends
val
who
told
you
this
strange
piece
of
news
sir
sgan
do
not
let
us
dissimulate
i
have
it
from
isabella
who
sends
you
word
by
me
for
the
last
time
that
she
has
plainly
enough
shown
you
what
her
choice
is
that
her
heart
entirely
mine
is
insulted
by
such
a
plan
that
she
would
rather
die
than
suffer
such
an
outrage
and
that
you
will
cause
a
terrible
uproar
unless
you
put
an
end
to
all
this
confusion
val
if
she
really
said
what
i
have
just
heard
i
confess
that
my
passion
has
nothing
more
to
expect
these
expressions
are
plain
enough
to
let
me
see
that
all
is
ended
i
must
respect
the
judgment
she
has
passed
sgan
if
you
doubt
it
then
and
fancy
all
the
complaints
that
i
have
made
to
you
on
her
behalf
are
mere
pretences
do
you
wish
that
she
herself
should
tell
you
her
feelings
to
set
you
right
i
willingly
consent
to
it
follow
me
you
shall
hear
if
i
have
added
anything
and
if
her
young
heart
hesitates
between
us
two
and
knocks
at
his
own
scene
isabella
sganarelle
valère
ergaste
isa
what
you
bring
valère
to
me
what
is
your
design
are
you
taking
his
part
against
me
and
do
you
wish
charmed
by
his
rare
merits
to
compel
me
to
love
him
and
endure
his
visits
sgan
no
my
love
your
affection
is
too
dear
to
me
for
that
but
he
believes
that
my
messages
are
untrue
he
thinks
that
it
is
i
who
speak
and
cunningly
represent
you
as
full
of
hatred
for
him
and
of
tenderness
for
me
i
wish
therefore
from
your
own
mouth
infallibly
to
cure
him
of
a
mistake
which
nourishes
his
love
isa
what
is
not
my
soul
completely
bared
to
your
eyes
and
can
you
still
doubt
whom
i
love
val
yes
all
that
this
gentleman
has
told
me
on
your
behalf
madam
might
well
surprise
a
man
i
confess
i
doubted
it
this
final
sentence
which
decides
the
fate
of
my
great
love
moves
my
feelings
so
much
that
it
can
be
no
offence
if
i
wish
to
have
it
repeated
isa
no
no
such
a
sentence
should
not
surprise
you
sganarelle
told
you
my
very
sentiments
i
consider
them
to
be
sufficiently
founded
on
justice
to
make
their
full
truth
clear
yes
i
desire
it
to
be
known
and
i
ought
to
be
believed
that
fate
here
presents
two
objects
to
my
eyes
who
inspiring
me
with
different
sentiments
agitate
my
heart
one
by
a
just
choice
in
which
my
honour
is
involved
has
all
my
esteem
and
love
and
the
other
in
return
for
his
affection
has
all
my
anger
and
aversion
the
presence
of
the
one
is
pleasing
and
dear
to
me
and
fills
me
with
joy
but
the
sight
of
the
other
inspires
me
with
secret
emotions
of
hatred
and
horror
to
see
myself
the
wife
of
the
one
is
all
my
desire
and
rather
than
belong
to
the
other
i
would
lose
my
life
but
i
have
sufficiently
declared
my
real
sentiments
and
languished
too
long
under
this
severe
torture
he
whom
i
love
must
use
diligence
to
make
him
whom
i
hate
lose
all
hope
and
deliver
me
by
a
happy
marriage
from
a
suffering
more
terrible
than
death
sgan
yes

i
intend
to
gratify
your
wish
isa
it
is
the
only
way
to
make
me
happy
sgan
you
shall
soon
be
so
isa
i
know
it
is
a
shame
for
a
young
woman
so
openly
to
declare
her
love
sgan
no
no
isa
but
seeing
what
my
lot
is
such
liberty
must
be
allowed
me
i
can
without
blushing
make
so
tender
a
confession
to
him
whom
i
already
regard
as
a
husband
sgan
yes
my
poor
child
darling
of
my
soul

let
him
think
then
how
to
prove
his
passion

my
hand

let
him
without
more
sighing
hasten
a
marriage

borrowed
my
room
in
which
i
have
shut
her
up
sgan
what
isa
could
it
be
believed
she
is
in
love
with
that
suitor
whom
we
have
discarded
sgan
with
valère
isa
desperately
her
passion
is
so
great
that
i
can
compare
it
with
nothing
you
may
judge
of
its
violence
by
her
coming
here
alone
at
this
hour
to
confide
to
me
her
love
and
to
tell
me
positively
that
she
will
die
if
she
does
not
obtain
the
object
of
her
desire
that
for
more
than
a
year
a
secret
intercourse
has
kept
up
the
ardour
of
their
love
and
that
they
had
even
pledged
themselves
to
marry
each
other
when
their
passion
was
new
sgan
oh
the
wretched
girl
isa
that
being
informed
of
the
despair
into
which
i
had
plunged
the
man
whom
she
loves
to
see
she
came
to
beg
me
to
allow
her
to
prevent
a
departure
which
would
break
her
heart
to
meet
this
lover
under
my
name
in
the
little
street
on
which
my
room
looks
where
counterfeiting
my
voice
she
may
utter
certain
tender
feelings
and
thereby
tempt
him
to
stay
in
short
cleverly
to
secure
for
herself
the
regard
which
it
is
known
he
has
for
me
sgan
and
do
you
think
this
isa
i
i
am
enraged
at
it
what
said
i
sister
are
you
mad
do
you
not
blush
to
indulge
in
such
a
love
for
one
of
those
people
who
change
every
day
to
forget
your
sex
and
betray
the
trust
put
in
you
by
the
man
whom
heaven
has
destined
you
to
marry
sgan
he
deserves
it
richly
i
am
delighted
by
it
isa
finally
my
vexation
employed
a
hundred
arguments
to
reprove
such
baseness
in
her
and
enable
me
to
refuse
her
request
for
but
she
became
so
importunate
shed
so
many
tears
heaved
so
many
sighs
said
so
often
that
i
was
driving
her
to
despair
if
i
refused
to
gratify
her
passion
that
my
heart
was
brought
to
consent
in
spite
of
me
and
to
justify
this
night
intrigue
to
which
affection
for
my
own
sister
made
me
assent
i
was
about
to
bring
lucretia
to
sleep
with
me
whose
virtues
you
extol
to
me
daily
but
you
surprised
me
by
your
speedy
return
sgan
no
no
i
will
not
have
all
this
mystery
at
my
house
as
for
my
brother
i
might
agree
to
it
but
they
may
be
seen
by
some
one
in
the
street
and
she
whom
i
am
to
honour
with
my
body
must
not
only
be
modest
and
she
must
not
even
be
suspected
let
us
send
the
miserable
girl
away
and
let
her
passion
isa
ah
you
would
overwhelm
her
with
confusion
and
she
might
justly
complain
of
my
want
of
discretion
since
i
must
not
countenance
her
design
at
least
wait
till
i
send
her
away
sgan
well
do
so
isa
but
above
all
conceal
yourself
i
beg
of
you
and
be
content
to
see
her
depart
without
speaking
one
word
to
her
sgan
yes
for
your
sake
i
will
restrain
my
anger
but
as
soon
as
she
is
gone
i
will
go

find
my

be
delighted

if
you
will
not
make

the
riddle
is

that
she

your
léonor
in

that
they
had
pledged
each
other
before

of
running

this
story
is
so
very
improbable

he
will
not
believe
it
even
when
he
sees
it

getting
angry
upon
my
word

not

mean
nothing
upon

only
follow
me
your
mind
shall
be
satisfied
directly
you
shall
see
whether
i
am
deceiving
you
and
whether
they
have
not
pledged
their
troth
for
more
than
a

is
it

could
thus
have
agreed

in
everything
from
her
infancy
ever
displayed
towards
her

would
never

vastly
preferred
to
see
myself
in
another
hands
val
for
me
i
esteem
it
my
greatest
glory
and
happiness
to
receive
her
sir
from
your
hands
ar
brother
you
must
take
this
matter
quietly
your
own
conduct
is
the
cause
of
this
i
can
see
it
is
your
unhappy
lot
that
no
one
will
pity
you
though
they
know
you
have
been
made
a
fool
of
lis
upon
my
word
i
am
glad
of
this
this
reward
of
his
mistrust
is
a
striking
retribution
leo
i
do
not
know
whether
the
trick
ought
to
be
commended
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
at
least
can
not
blame
it
erg
his
star
condemns
him
to
be
a
cuckold
it
is
lucky
for
him
he
is
only
a
retrospective
one
sgan
from
the
stupor
into
which
he
had
been
no
i
can
not
get
the
better
of
my
astonishment
this
faithlessness
perplexes
my
understanding
i
think
that
satan
in
person
could
be
no
worse
than
such
a
jade
i
could
have
sworn
it
was
not
in
her
unhappy
he
who
trusts
a
woman
after
this
the
best
of
them
are
always
full
of
mischief
they
were
made
to
damn
the
whole
world
i
renounce
the
treacherous
sex
for
ever
and
give
them
to
the
devil
with
all
my
heart
erg
well
said
ar
let
us
all
go
to
my
house
come
valère
tomorrow
we
will
try
to
appease
his
wrath
lis
the
as
for
you
if
you
know
any
churlish
husbands
by
all
means
send
them
to
school
with
us

is
the
last

for
the
first
