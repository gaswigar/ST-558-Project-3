introductory
note
bacon
literary
executor
rowley
published
the
new
atlantis
in
the
year
after
the
author
death
it
seems
to
have
been
written
about
during
that
period
of
literary
activity
which
followed
bacon
political
fall
none
of
bacon
writings
gives
in
short
apace
so
vivid
a
picture
of
his
tastes
and
aspirations
as
this
fragment
of
the
plan
of
an
ideal
commonwealth
the
generosity
and
enlightenment
the
dignity
and
splendor
the
piety
and
public
spirit
of
the
inhabitants
of
bensalem
represent
the
ideal
qualities
which
bacon
the
statesman
desired
rather
than
hoped
to
see
characteristic
of
his
own
country
and
in
solomon
house
we
have
bacon
the
scientist
indulging
without
restriction
his
prophetic
vision
of
the
future
of
human
knowledge
no
reader
acquainted
in
any
degree
with
the
processes
and
results
of
modern
scientific
inquiry
can
fail
to
be
struck
by
the
numerous
approximations
made
by
bacon
imagination
to
the
actual
achievements
of
modern
times
the
plan
and
organization
of
his
great
college
lay
down
the
main
lines
of
the
modern
research
university
and
both
in
pure
and
applied
science
he
anticipates
a
strikingly
large
number
of
recent
inventions
and
discoveries
in
still
another
way
is
the
new
atlantis
typical
of
bacon
attitude
in
spite
of
the
enthusiastic
and
schemes
he
laid
down
for
the
pursuit
of
truth
bacon
always
had
an
eye
to
utility
the
advancement
of
science
which
he
sought
was
conceived
by
him
as
a
means
to
a
practical
end
the
increase
of
man
control
over
nature
and
the
comfort
and
convenience
of
humanity
for
pure
metaphysics
or
any
form
of
abstract
thinking
that
yielded
no
fruit
he
had
little
interest
and
this
leaning
to
the
useful
is
shown
in
the
practical
applications
of
the
discoveries
made
by
the
scholars
of
solomon
house
nor
does
the
interest
of
the
work
stop
here
it
contains
much
both
in
its
political
and
in
its
scientific
ideals
that
we
have
as
yet
by
no
means
achieved
but
which
contain
valuable
elements
of
suggestion
and
stimulus
for
the
future
the
new
atlantis
we
sailed
from
peru
where
we
had
continued
for
the
space
of
one
whole
year
for
china
and
japan
by
the
south
sea
taking
with
us
victuals
for
twelve
months
and
had
good
winds
from
the
east
though
soft
and
weak
for
five
months
space
and
more
but
the
wind
came
about
and
settled
in
the
west
for
many
days
so
as
we
could
make
little
or
no
way
and
were
sometime
in
purpose
to
turn
back
but
then
again
there
arose
strong
and
great
winds
from
the
south
with
a
point
east
which
carried
us
up
for
all
that
we
could
do
towards
the
north
by
which
time
our
victuals
failed
us
though
we
had
made
good
spare
of
them
so
that
finding
ourselves
in
the
midst
of
the
greatest
wilderness
of
waters
in
the
world
without
victuals
we
gave
ourselves
for
lost
men
and
prepared
for
death
yet
we
did
lift
up
our
hearts
and
voices
to
god
above
who
showeth
his
wonders
in
the
deep
beseeching
him
of
his
mercy
that
as
in
the
beginning
he
discovered
the
face
of
the
deep
and
brought
forth
dry
land
so
he
would
now
discover
land
to
us
that
we
might
not
perish
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
next
day
about
evening
we
saw
within
a
kenning
before
us
towards
the
north
as
it
were
thick
clouds
which
did
put
us
in
some
hope
of
land
knowing
how
that
part
of
the
south
sea
was
utterly
unknown
and
might
have
islands
or
continents
that
hitherto
were
not
come
to
light
wherefore
we
bent
our
course
thither
where
we
saw
the
appearance
of
land
all
that
night
and
in
the
dawning
of
the
next
day
we
might
plainly
discern
that
it
was
a
land
flat
to
our
sight
and
full
of
boscage
which
made
it
show
the
more
dark
and
after
an
hour
and
a
half
sailing
we
entered
into
a
good
haven
being
the
port
of
a
fair
city
not
great
indeed
but
well
built
and
that
gave
a
pleasant
view
from
the
sea
and
we
thinking
every
minute
long
till
we
were
on
land
came
close
to
the
shore
and
offered
to
land
but
straightways
we
saw
divers
of
the
people
with
bastons
in
their
hands
as
it
were
forbidding
us
to
land
yet
without
any
cries
of
fierceness
but
only
as
warning
us
off
by
signs
that
they
made
whereupon
being
not
a
little
discomforted
we
were
advising
with
ourselves
what
we
should
do
during
which
time
there
made
forth
to
us
a
small
boat
with
about
eight
persons
in
it
whereof
one
of
them
had
in
his
hand
a
tipstaff
of
a
yellow
cane
tipped
at
both
ends
with
blue
who
came
aboard
our
ship
without
any
show
of
distrust
at
all
and
when
he
saw
one
of
our
number
present
himself
somewhat
before
the
rest
he
drew
forth
a
little
scroll
of
parchment
somewhat
yellower
than
our
parchment
and
shining
like
the
leaves
of
writing
tables
but
otherwise
soft
and
flexible
and
delivered
it
to
our
foremost
man
in
which
scroll
were
written
in
ancient
hebrew
and
in
ancient
greek
and
in
good
latin
of
the
school
and
in
spanish
these
words
land
ye
not
none
of
you
and
provide
to
be
gone
from
this
coast
within
sixteen
days
except
you
have
further
time
given
you
meanwhile
if
you
want
fresh
water
or
victuals
or
help
for
your
sick
or
that
your
ship
needeth
repairs
write
down
your
wants
and
you
shall
have
that
which
belongeth
to
mercy
this
scroll
was
signed
with
a
stamp
of
cherubim
wings
not
spread
but
hanging
downwards
and
by
them
a
cross
this
being
delivered
the
officer
returned
and
left
only
a
servant
with
us
to
receive
our
answer
consulting
hereupon
amongst
ourselves
we
were
much
perplexed
the
denial
of
landing
and
hasty
warning
us
away
troubled
us
much
on
the
other
side
to
find
that
the
people
had
languages
and
were
so
full
of
humanity
did
comfort
us
not
a
little
and
above
all
the
sign
of
the
cross
to
that
instrument
was
to
us
a
great
rejoicing
and
as
it
were
a
certain
presage
of
good
our
answer
was
in
the
spanish
tongue
that
for
our
ship
it
was
well
for
we
had
rather
met
with
calms
and
contrary
winds
than
any
tempests
for
our
sick
they
were
many
and
in
very
ill
case
so
that
if
they
were
not
permitted
to
land
they
ran
danger
of
their
lives
our
other
wants
we
set
down
in
particular
adding
that
we
had
some
little
store
of
merchandise
which
if
it
pleased
them
to
deal
for
it
might
supply
our
wants
without
being
chargeable
unto
them
we
offered
some
reward
in
pistolets
unto
the
servant
and
a
piece
of
crimson
velvet
to
be
presented
to
the
officer
but
the
servant
took
them
not
nor
would
scarce
look
upon
them
and
so
left
us
and
went
back
in
another
little
boat
which
was
sent
for
him
about
three
hours
after
we
had
dispatched
our
answer
there
came
towards
us
a
person
as
it
seemed
of
place
he
had
on
him
a
gown
with
wide
sleeves
of
a
kind
of
water
chamolet
of
an
excellent
azure
colour
fair
more
glossy
than
ours
his
under
apparel
was
green
and
so
was
his
hat
being
in
the
form
of
a
turban
daintily
made
and
not
so
huge
as
the
turkish
turbans
and
the
locks
of
his
hair
came
down
below
the
brims
of
it
a
reverend
man
was
he
to
behold
he
came
in
a
boat
gilt
in
some
part
of
it
with
four
persons
more
only
in
that
boat
and
was
followed
by
another
boat
wherein
were
some
twenty
when
he
was
come
within
a
flightshot
of
our
ship
signs
were
made
to
us
that
we
should
send
forth
some
to
meet
him
upon
the
water
which
we
presently
did
in
our
sending
the
principal
man
amongst
us
save
one
and
four
of
our
number
with
him
when
we
were
come
within
six
yards
of
their
boat
they
called
to
us
to
stay
and
not
to
approach
farther
which
we
did
and
thereupon
the
man
whom
i
before
described
stood
up
and
with
a
loud
voice
in
spanish
asked
are
ye
christians
we
answered
we
were
fearing
the
less
because
of
the
cross
we
had
seen
in
the
subscription
at
which
answer
the
said
person
lifted
up
his
right
hand
towards
heaven
and
drew
it
softly
to
his
mouth
which
is
the
gesture
they
use
when
they
thank
god
and
then
said
if
ye
will
swear
all
of
you
by
the
merits
of
the
saviour
that
ye
are
no
pirates
nor
have
shed
blood
lawfully
nor
unlawfully
within
forty
days
past
you
may
have
licence
to
come
on
land
we
said
we
were
all
ready
to
take
that
oath
whereupon
one
of
those
that
were
with
him
being
as
it
seemed
a
notary
made
an
entry
of
this
act
which
done
another
of
the
attendants
of
the
great
person
which
was
with
him
in
the
same
boat
after
his
lord
had
spoken
a
little
to
him
said
aloud
my
lord
would
have
you
know
that
it
is
not
of
pride
or
greatness
that
he
cometh
not
aboard
your
ship
but
for
that
in
your
answer
you
declare
that
you
have
many
sick
amongst
you
he
was
warned
by
the
conservator
of
health
of
the
city
that
he
should
keep
a
distance
we
bowed
ourselves
towards
him
and
answered
we
were
his
humble
servants
and
accounted
for
great
honour
and
singular
humanity
towards
us
that
which
was
already
done
but
hoped
well
that
the
nature
of
the
sickness
of
our
men
was
not
infectious
so
he
returned
and
a
while
after
came
the
notary
to
us
aboard
our
ship
holding
in
his
hand
a
fruit
of
that
country
like
an
orange
but
of
color
between
and
scarlet
which
cast
a
most
excellent
odour
he
used
it
as
it
seemeth
for
a
preservative
against
infection
he
gave
us
our
oath
by
the
name
of
jesus
and
his
merits
and
after
told
us
that
the
next
day
by
six
of
the
clock
in
the
morning
we
should
be
sent
to
and
brought
to
the
strangers
house
so
he
called
it
where
we
should
be
accommodated
of
things
both
for
our
whole
and
for
our
sick
so
he
left
us
and
when
we
offered
him
some
pistolets
he
smiling
said
he
must
not
be
twice
paid
for
one
labour
meaning
as
i
take
it
that
he
had
salary
sufficient
of
the
state
for
his
service
for
as
i
after
learned
they
call
an
officer
that
taketh
rewards
twice
paid
the
next
morning
early
there
came
to
us
the
same
officer
that
came
to
us
at
first
with
his
cane
and
told
us
he
came
to
conduct
us
to
the
strangers
house
and
that
he
had
prevented
the
hour
because
we
might
have
the
whole
day
before
us
for
our
business
for
said
he
if
you
will
follow
my
advice
there
shall
first
go
with
me
some
few
of
you
and
see
the
place
and
how
it
may
be
made
convenient
for
you
and
then
you
may
send
for
your
sick
and
the
rest
of
your
number
which
ye
will
bring
on
land
we
thanked
him
and
said
that
this
care
which
he
took
of
desolate
strangers
god
would
reward
and
so
six
of
us
went
on
land
with
him
and
when
we
were
on
land
he
went
before
us
and
turned
to
us
and
said
he
was
but
our
servant
and
our
guide
he
led
us
through
three
fair
streets
and
all
the
way
we
went
there
were
gathered
some
people
on
both
sides
standing
in
a
row
but
in
so
civil
a
fashion
as
if
it
had
been
not
to
wonder
at
us
but
to
welcome
us
and
divers
of
them
as
we
passed
by
them
put
their
arms
a
little
abroad
which
is
their
gesture
when
they
did
bid
any
welcome
the
strangers
house
is
a
fair
and
spacious
house
built
of
brick
of
somewhat
a
bluer
colour
than
our
brick
and
with
handsome
windows
some
of
glass
some
of
a
kind
of
cambric
oiled
he
brought
us
first
into
a
fair
parlour
above
stairs
and
then
asked
us
what
number
of
persons
we
were
and
how
many
sick
we
answered
we
were
in
all
sick
and
whole
one
and
fifty
persons
whereof
our
sick
were
seventeen
he
desired
us
to
have
patience
a
little
and
to
stay
till
he
came
back
to
us
which
was
about
an
hour
after
and
then
he
led
us
to
see
the
chambers
which
were
provided
for
us
being
in
number
nineteen
they
having
cast
it
as
it
seemeth
that
four
of
those
chambers
which
were
better
than
the
rest
might
receive
four
of
the
principal
men
of
our
company
and
lodge
them
alone
by
themselves
and
the
other
fifteen
chambers
were
to
lodge
us
two
and
two
together
the
chambers
were
handsome
and
cheerful
chambers
and
furnished
civilly
then
he
led
us
to
a
long
gallery
like
a
dorture
where
he
showed
us
all
along
the
one
side
for
the
other
side
was
but
wall
and
window
seventeen
cells
very
neat
ones
having
partitions
of
cedar
wood
which
gallery
and
cells
being
in
all
forty
many
more
than
we
needed
were
instituted
as
an
infirmary
for
sick
persons
and
he
told
us
withal
that
as
any
of
our
sick
waxed
well
he
might
be
removed
from
his
cell
to
a
chamber
for
which
purpose
there
were
set
forth
ten
spare
chambers
besides
the
number
we
spake
of
before
this
done
he
brought
us
back
to
the
parlour
and
lifting
up
his
cane
a
little
as
they
do
when
they
give
any
charge
or
command
said
to
us
ye
are
to
know
that
the
custom
of
the
land
requireth
that
after
this
day
and
which
we
give
you
for
removing
of
your
people
from
your
ship
you
are
to
keep
within
doors
for
three
days
but
let
it
not
trouble
you
nor
do
not
think
yourselves
restrained
but
rather
left
to
your
rest
and
ease
you
shall
want
nothing
and
there
are
six
of
our
people
appointed
to
attend
you
for
any
business
you
may
have
abroad
we
gave
him
thanks
with
all
affection
and
respect
and
said
god
surely
is
manifested
in
this
land
we
offered
him
also
twenty
pistolets
but
he
smiled
and
only
said
what
twice
paid
and
so
he
left
us
soon
after
our
dinner
was
served
in
which
was
right
good
viands
both
for
bread
and
treat
better
than
any
collegiate
diet
that
i
have
known
in
europe
we
had
also
drink
of
three
sorts
all
wholesome
and
good
wine
of
the
grape
a
drink
of
grain
such
as
is
with
us
our
ale
but
more
clear
and
a
kind
of
cider
made
of
a
fruit
of
that
country
a
wonderful
pleasing
and
refreshing
drink
besides
there
were
brought
in
to
us
great
store
of
those
scarlet
oranges
for
our
sick
which
they
said
were
an
assured
remedy
for
sickness
taken
at
sea
there
was
given
us
also
a
box
of
small
gray
or
whitish
pills
which
they
wished
our
sick
should
take
one
of
the
pills
every
night
before
sleep
which
they
said
would
hasten
their
recovery
the
next
day
after
that
our
trouble
of
carriage
and
removing
of
our
men
and
goods
out
of
our
ship
was
somewhat
settled
and
quiet
i
thought
good
to
call
our
company
together
and
when
they
were
assembled
said
unto
them
my
dear
friends
let
us
know
ourselves
and
how
it
standeth
with
us
we
are
men
cast
on
land
as
jonas
was
out
of
the
whale
belly
when
we
were
as
buried
in
the
deep
and
now
we
are
on
land
we
are
but
between
death
and
life
for
we
are
beyond
both
the
old
world
and
the
new
and
whether
ever
we
shall
see
europe
god
only
knoweth
it
is
a
kind
of
miracle
bath
brought
us
hither
and
it
must
be
little
less
that
shall
bring
us
hence
therefore
in
regard
of
our
deliverance
past
and
our
danger
present
and
to
come
let
us
look
up
to
god
and
every
man
reform
his
own
ways
besides
we
are
come
here
amongst
a
christian
people
full
of
piety
and
humanity
let
us
not
bring
that
confusion
of
face
upon
ourselves
as
to
show
our
vices
or
unworthiness
before
them
yet
there
is
more
for
they
have
by
commandment
though
in
form
of
courtesy
cloistered
us
within
these
wall
for
three
days
who
knoweth
whether
it
be
not
to
take
some
taste
of
our
manners
and
conditions
and
if
they
find
them
bad
to
banish
us
straightways
if
good
to
give
us
further
time
for
these
men
that
they
have
given
us
for
attendance
may
withal
have
an
eye
upon
us
therefore
for
god
love
and
as
we
love
the
weal
of
our
souls
and
bodies
let
us
so
behave
ourselves
as
we
may
be
at
peace
with
god
and
may
find
grace
in
the
eyes
of
this
people
our
company
with
one
voice
thanked
me
for
my
good
admonition
and
promised
me
to
live
soberly
and
civilly
and
without
giving
any
the
least
occasion
of
offence
so
we
spent
our
three
days
joyfully
and
without
care
in
expectation
what
would
be
done
with
us
when
they
were
expired
during
which
time
we
had
every
hour
joy
of
the
amendment
of
our
sick
who
thought
themselves
cast
into
some
divine
pool
of
healing
they
mended
so
kindly
and
so
fast
the
morrow
after
our
three
days
were
past
there
came
to
us
a
new
man
that
we
had
not
seen
before
clothed
in
blue
as
the
former
was
save
that
his
turban
was
white
with
a
small
red
cross
on
the
top
he
had
also
a
tippet
of
fine
linen
at
his
coming
in
he
did
bend
to
us
a
little
and
put
his
arms
abroad
we
of
our
parts
saluted
him
in
a
very
lowly
and
submissive
manner
as
looking
that
from
him
we
should
receive
sentence
of
life
or
death
he
desired
to
speak
with
some
few
of
us
whereupon
six
of
us
only
staid
and
the
rest
avoided
the
room
he
said
i
am
by
office
governor
of
this
house
of
strangers
and
by
vocation
i
am
a
christian
priest
and
therefore
am
come
to
you
to
offer
you
my
service
both
as
strangers
and
chiefly
as
christians
some
things
i
may
tell
you
which
i
think
you
will
not
be
unwilling
to
hear
the
state
hath
given
you
license
to
stay
on
land
for
the
space
of
six
weeks
and
let
it
not
trouble
you
if
your
occasions
ask
further
time
for
the
law
in
this
point
is
not
precise
and
i
do
not
doubt
but
my
self
shall
be
able
to
obtain
for
you
such
further
time
as
may
be
convenient
ye
shall
also
understand
that
the
strangers
house
is
at
this
time
rich
and
much
aforehand
for
it
hath
laid
up
revenue
these
years
for
so
long
it
is
since
any
stranger
arrived
in
this
part
and
therefore
take
ye
no
care
the
state
will
defray
you
all
the
time
you
stay
neither
shall
you
stay
one
day
the
less
for
that
as
for
any
merchandise
ye
have
brought
ye
shall
be
well
used
and
have
your
return
either
in
merchandise
or
in
gold
and
silver
for
to
us
it
is
all
one
and
if
you
have
any
other
request
to
make
hide
it
not
for
ye
shall
find
we
will
not
make
your
countenance
to
fall
by
the
answer
ye
shall
receive
only
this
i
must
tell
you
that
none
of
you
must
go
above
a
karan
that
is
with
them
a
mile
and
an
half
from
the
walls
of
the
city
without
especial
leave
we
answered
after
we
had
looked
awhile
one
upon
another
admiring
this
gracious
and
usage
that
we
could
not
tell
what
to
say
for
we
wanted
words
to
express
our
thanks
and
his
noble
free
offers
left
us
nothing
to
ask
it
seemed
to
us
that
we
had
before
us
a
picture
of
our
salvation
in
heaven
for
we
that
were
a
while
since
in
the
jaws
of
death
were
now
brought
into
a
place
where
we
found
nothing
but
consolations
for
the
commandment
laid
upon
us
we
would
not
fail
to
obey
it
though
it
was
impossible
but
our
hearts
should
be
enflamed
to
tread
further
upon
this
happy
and
holy
ground
we
added
that
our
tongues
should
first
cleave
to
the
roofs
of
our
mouths
ere
we
should
forget
either
his
reverend
person
or
this
whole
nation
in
our
prayers
we
also
most
humbly
besought
him
to
accept
of
us
as
his
true
servants
by
as
just
a
right
as
ever
men
on
earth
were
bounden
laying
and
presenting
both
our
persons
and
all
we
had
at
his
feet
he
said
he
was
a
priest
and
looked
for
a
priest
reward
which
was
our
brotherly
love
and
the
good
of
our
souls
and
bodies
so
he
went
from
us
not
without
tears
of
tenderness
in
his
eyes
and
left
us
also
confused
with
joy
and
kindness
saying
amongst
ourselves
that
we
were
come
into
a
land
of
angels
which
did
appear
to
us
daily
and
prevent
us
with
comforts
which
we
thought
not
of
much
less
expected
the
next
day
about
ten
of
the
clock
the
governor
came
to
us
again
and
after
salutations
said
familiarly
that
he
was
come
to
visit
us
and
called
for
a
chair
and
sat
him
down
and
we
being
some
ten
of
us
the
rest
were
of
the
meaner
sort
or
else
gone
abroad
sat
down
with
him
and
when
we
were
set
he
began
thus
we
of
this
island
of
bensalem
for
so
they
call
it
in
their
language
have
this
that
by
means
of
our
solitary
situation
and
of
the
laws
of
secrecy
which
we
have
for
our
travellers
and
our
rare
admission
of
strangers
we
know
well
most
part
of
the
habitable
world
and
are
ourselves
unknown
therefore
because
he
that
knoweth
least
is
fittest
to
ask
questions
it
is
more
reason
for
the
entertainment
of
the
time
that
ye
ask
me
questions
than
that
i
ask
you
we
answered
that
we
humbly
thanked
him
that
he
would
give
us
leave
so
to
do
and
that
we
conceived
by
the
taste
we
had
already
that
there
was
no
worldly
thing
on
earth
more
worthy
to
be
known
than
the
state
of
that
happy
land
but
above
all
we
said
since
that
we
were
met
from
the
several
ends
of
the
world
and
hoped
assuredly
that
we
should
meet
one
day
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
for
that
we
were
both
parts
christians
we
desired
to
know
in
respect
that
land
was
so
remote
and
so
divided
by
vast
and
unknown
seas
from
the
land
where
our
saviour
walked
on
earth
who
was
the
apostle
of
that
nation
and
how
it
was
converted
to
the
faith
it
appeared
in
his
face
that
he
took
great
contentment
in
this
our
question
he
said
ye
knit
my
heart
to
you
by
asking
this
question
in
the
first
place
for
it
sheweth
that
you
first
seek
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
i
shall
gladly
and
briefly
satisfy
your
demand
about
twenty
years
after
the
ascension
of
our
saviour
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
seen
by
the
people
of
renfusa
a
city
upon
the
eastern
coast
of
our
island
within
night
the
night
was
cloudy
and
calm
as
it
might
be
some
mile
into
the
sea
a
great
pillar
of
light
not
sharp
but
in
form
of
a
column
or
cylinder
rising
from
the
sea
a
great
way
up
towards
heaven
and
on
the
top
of
it
was
seen
a
large
cross
of
light
more
bright
and
resplendent
than
the
body
of
the
pillar
upon
which
so
strange
a
spectacle
the
people
of
the
city
gathered
apace
together
upon
the
sands
to
wonder
and
so
after
put
themselves
into
a
number
of
small
boats
to
go
nearer
to
this
marvellous
sight
but
when
the
boats
were
come
within
about
sixty
yards
of
the
pillar
they
found
themselves
all
bound
and
could
go
no
further
yet
so
as
they
might
move
to
go
about
but
might
not
approach
nearer
so
as
the
boats
stood
all
as
in
a
theatre
beholding
this
light
as
an
heavenly
sign
it
so
fell
out
that
there
was
in
one
of
the
boats
one
of
the
wise
men
of
the
society
of
salomon
house
which
house
or
college
my
good
brethren
is
the
very
eye
of
this
kingdom
who
having
awhile
attentively
and
devoutly
viewed
and
contemplated
this
pillar
and
cross
fell
down
upon
his
face
and
then
raised
himself
upon
his
knees
and
lifting
up
his
hands
to
heaven
made
his
prayers
in
this
manner
god
of
heaven
and
earth
thou
hast
vouchsafed
of
thy
grace
to
those
of
our
order
to
know
thy
works
of
creation
and
the
secrets
of
them
and
to
discern
as
far
as
appertaineth
to
the
generations
of
men
between
divine
miracles
works
of
nature
works
of
art
and
impostures
and
illusions
of
all
sorts
i
do
here
acknowledge
and
testify
before
this
people
that
the
thing
which
we
now
see
before
our
eyes
is
thy
finger
and
a
true
miracle
and
forasmuch
as
we
learn
in
our
books
that
thou
never
workest
miracles
but
to
divine
and
excellent
end
for
the
laws
of
nature
are
thine
own
laws
and
thou
exceedest
them
not
but
upon
great
cause
we
most
humbly
beseech
thee
to
prosper
this
great
sign
and
to
give
us
the
interpretation
and
use
of
it
in
mercy
which
thou
dost
in
some
part
secretly
promise
by
sending
it
unto
us
when
he
had
made
his
prayer
he
presently
found
the
boat
he
was
in
moveable
and
unbound
whereas
all
the
rest
remained
still
fast
and
taking
that
for
an
assurance
of
leave
to
approach
he
caused
the
boat
to
be
softly
and
with
silence
rowed
towards
the
pillar
but
ere
he
came
near
it
the
pillar
and
cross
of
light
brake
up
and
cast
itself
abroad
as
it
were
into
a
firmament
of
many
stars
which
also
vanished
soon
after
and
there
was
nothing
left
to
be
seen
but
a
small
ark
or
chest
of
cedar
dry
and
not
wet
at
all
with
water
though
it
swam
and
in
the
of
it
which
was
towards
him
grew
a
small
green
branch
of
palm
and
when
the
wise
man
had
taken
it
with
all
reverence
into
his
boat
it
opened
of
itself
and
there
were
found
in
it
a
book
and
a
letter
both
written
in
fine
parchment
and
wrapped
in
sindons
of
linen
the
book
contained
all
the
canonical
books
of
the
old
and
new
testament
according
as
you
have
them
for
we
know
well
what
the
churches
with
you
receive
and
the
apocalypse
itself
and
some
other
books
of
the
new
testament
which
were
not
at
that
time
written
were
nevertheless
in
the
book
and
for
the
letter
it
was
in
these
words
bartholomew
a
servant
of
the
highest
and
apostle
of
jesus
christ
was
warned
by
an
angel
that
appeareth
to
me
in
a
vision
of
glory
that
i
should
commit
this
ark
to
the
floods
of
the
sea
therefore
i
do
testify
and
declare
unto
that
people
where
god
shall
ordain
this
ark
to
come
to
land
that
in
the
same
day
is
come
unto
them
salvation
and
peace
and
from
the
father
and
from
the
lord
jesus
there
was
also
in
both
these
writings
as
well
the
book
as
the
letter
wrought
a
great
miracle
conform
to
that
of
the
apostles
in
the
original
gift
of
tongues
for
there
being
at
that
time
in
this
land
hebrews
persians
and
indians
besides
the
natives
every
one
read
upon
the
book
and
letter
as
if
they
had
been
written
in
his
own
language
and
thus
was
this
land
saved
from
infidelity
as
the
remainder
of
the
old
world
was
from
water
by
an
ark
through
the
apostolical
and
miraculous
evangelism
of
saint
bartholomew
and
here
he
paused
and
a
messenger
came
and
called
him
from
us
so
this
was
all
that
passed
in
that
conference
the
next
day
the
same
governor
came
again
to
us
immediately
after
dinner
and
excused
himself
saying
that
the
day
before
he
was
called
from
us
somewhat
abruptly
but
now
he
would
make
us
amends
and
spend
time
with
us
if
we
held
his
company
and
conference
agreeable
we
answered
that
we
held
it
so
agreeable
and
pleasing
to
us
as
we
forgot
both
dangers
past
and
fears
to
come
for
the
time
we
hear
him
speak
and
that
we
thought
an
hour
spent
with
him
was
worth
years
of
our
former
life
he
bowed
himself
a
little
to
us
and
after
we
were
set
again
he
said
well
the
questions
are
on
your
part
one
of
our
number
said
after
a
little
pause
that
there
was
a
matter
we
were
no
less
desirous
to
know
than
fearful
to
ask
lest
we
might
presume
too
far
but
encouraged
by
his
rare
humanity
towards
us
that
could
scarce
think
ourselves
strangers
being
his
vowed
and
professed
servants
we
would
take
the
hardiness
to
propound
it
humbly
beseeching
him
if
he
thought
it
not
fit
to
be
answered
that
he
would
pardon
it
though
he
rejected
it
we
said
we
well
observed
those
his
words
which
he
formerly
spake
that
this
happy
island
where
we
now
stood
was
known
to
few
and
yet
knew
most
of
the
nations
of
the
world
which
we
found
to
be
true
considering
they
had
the
languages
of
europe
and
knew
much
of
our
state
and
business
and
yet
we
in
europe
notwithstanding
all
the
remote
discoveries
and
navigations
of
this
last
age
never
heard
of
the
least
inkling
or
glimpse
of
this
island
this
we
found
wonderful
strange
for
that
all
nations
have
one
of
another
either
by
voyage
into
foreign
parts
or
by
strangers
that
come
to
them
and
though
the
traveller
into
a
foreign
country
doth
commonly
know
more
by
the
eye
than
he
that
stayeth
at
home
can
by
relation
of
the
traveller
yet
both
ways
suffice
to
make
a
mutual
knowledge
in
some
degree
on
both
parts
but
for
this
island
we
never
heard
tell
of
any
ship
of
theirs
that
had
been
seen
to
arrive
upon
any
shore
of
europe
nor
of
either
the
east
or
west
indies
nor
yet
of
any
ship
of
any
other
part
of
the
world
that
had
made
return
from
them
and
yet
the
marvel
rested
not
in
this
for
the
situation
of
it
as
his
lordship
said
in
the
secret
conclave
of
such
a
vast
sea
might
cause
it
but
then
that
they
should
have
knowledge
of
the
languages
books
affairs
of
those
that
lie
such
a
distance
from
them
it
was
a
thing
we
could
not
tell
what
to
make
of
for
that
it
seemed
to
us
a
conditioner
and
propriety
of
divine
powers
and
beings
to
be
hidden
and
unseen
to
others
and
yet
to
have
others
open
and
as
in
a
light
to
them
at
this
speech
the
governor
gave
a
gracious
smile
and
said
that
we
did
well
to
ask
pardon
for
this
question
we
now
asked
for
that
it
imported
as
if
we
thought
this
land
a
land
of
magicians
that
sent
forth
spirits
of
the
air
into
all
parts
to
bring
them
news
and
intelligence
of
other
countries
it
was
answered
by
us
all
in
all
possible
humbleness
but
yet
with
a
countenance
taking
knowledge
that
we
knew
that
he
spake
it
but
merrily
that
we
were
apt
enough
to
think
there
was
somewhat
supernatural
in
this
island
but
yet
rather
as
angelical
than
magical
but
to
let
his
lordship
know
truly
what
it
was
that
made
us
tender
and
doubtful
to
ask
this
question
it
was
not
any
such
conceit
but
because
we
remembered
he
had
given
a
touch
in
his
former
speech
that
this
land
had
laws
of
secrecy
touching
strangers
to
this
he
said
you
remember
it
aright
and
therefore
in
that
i
shall
say
to
you
i
must
reserve
some
particulars
which
it
is
not
lawful
for
me
to
reveal
but
there
will
be
enough
left
to
give
you
satisfaction
you
shall
understand
that
which
perhaps
you
will
scarce
think
credible
that
about
three
thousand
years
ago
or
somewhat
more
the
navigation
of
the
world
especially
for
remote
voyages
was
greater
than
at
this
day
do
not
think
with
yourselves
that
i
know
not
how
much
it
is
increased
with
you
within
these
years
i
know
it
well
and
yet
i
say
greater
then
than
now
whether
it
was
that
the
example
of
the
ark
that
saved
the
remnant
of
men
from
the
universal
deluge
gave
men
confidence
to
adventure
upon
the
waters
or
what
it
was
but
such
is
the
truth
the
phoenicians
and
especially
the
tyrians
had
great
fleets
so
had
the
carthaginians
their
colony
which
is
yet
further
west
toward
the
east
the
shipping
of
egypt
and
of
palestine
was
likewise
great
china
also
and
the
great
atlantis
that
you
call
america
which
have
now
but
junks
and
canoes
abounded
then
in
tall
ships
this
island
as
appeareth
by
faithful
registers
of
those
times
had
then
fifteen
hundred
strong
ships
of
great
content
of
all
this
there
is
with
you
sparing
memory
or
none
but
we
have
large
knowledge
thereof
at
that
time
this
land
was
known
and
frequented
by
the
ships
and
vessels
of
all
the
nations
before
named
and
as
it
cometh
to
pass
they
had
many
times
men
of
other
countries
that
were
no
sailors
that
came
with
them
as
persians
chaldeans
arabians
so
as
almost
all
nations
of
might
and
fame
resorted
hither
of
whom
we
have
some
stirps
and
little
tribes
with
us
at
this
day
and
for
our
own
ships
they
went
sundry
voyages
as
well
to
your
straits
which
you
call
the
pillars
of
hercules
as
to
other
parts
in
the
atlantic
and
mediterrane
seas
as
to
paguin
which
is
the
same
with
cambaline
and
quinzy
upon
the
oriental
seas
as
far
as
to
the
borders
of
the
east
tartary
at
the
same
time
and
an
age
after
or
more
the
inhabitants
of
the
great
atlantis
did
flourish
for
though
the
narration
and
description
which
is
made
by
a
great
man
with
you
that
the
descendants
of
neptune
planted
there
and
of
the
magnificent
temple
palace
city
and
hill
and
the
manifold
streams
of
goodly
navigable
rivers
which
as
so
many
chains
environed
the
same
site
and
temple
and
the
several
degrees
of
ascent
whereby
men
did
climb
up
to
the
same
as
if
it
had
been
a
scala
coeli
be
all
poetical
and
fabulous
yet
so
much
is
true
that
the
said
country
of
atlantis
as
well
that
of
peru
then
called
coya
as
that
of
mexico
then
named
tyrambel
were
mighty
and
proud
kingdoms
in
arms
shipping
and
riches
so
mighty
as
at
one
time
or
at
least
within
the
space
of
ten
years
they
both
made
two
great
expeditions
they
of
tyrambel
through
the
atlantic
to
the
mediterrane
sea
and
they
of
coya
through
the
south
sea
upon
this
our
island
and
for
the
former
of
these
which
was
into
europe
the
same
author
amongst
you
as
it
seemeth
had
some
relation
from
the
egyptian
priest
whom
he
cited
for
assuredly
such
a
thing
there
was
but
whether
it
were
the
ancient
athenians
that
had
the
glory
of
the
repulse
and
resistance
of
those
forces
i
can
say
nothing
but
certain
it
is
there
never
came
back
either
ship
or
man
from
that
voyage
neither
had
the
other
voyage
of
those
of
coya
upon
us
had
better
fortune
if
they
had
not
met
with
enemies
of
greater
clemency
for
the
king
of
this
island
by
name
altabin
a
wise
man
and
a
great
warrior
knowing
well
both
his
own
strength
and
that
of
his
enemies
handled
the
matter
so
as
he
cut
off
their
from
their
ships
and
entoiled
both
their
navy
and
their
tamp
with
a
greater
power
than
theirs
both
by
sea
and
land
arid
compelled
them
to
render
themselves
without
striking
stroke
and
after
they
were
at
his
mercy
contenting
himself
only
with
their
oath
that
they
should
no
more
bear
arms
against
him
dismissed
them
all
in
safety
but
the
divine
revenge
overtook
not
long
after
those
proud
enterprises
for
within
less
than
the
space
of
one
hundred
years
the
great
atlantis
was
utterly
lost
and
destroyed
not
by
a
great
earthquake
as
your
man
saith
for
that
whole
tract
is
little
subject
to
earthquakes
but
by
a
particular
deluge
or
inundation
those
countries
having
at
this
day
far
greater
rivers
and
far
higher
mountains
to
pour
down
waters
than
any
part
of
the
old
world
but
it
is
true
that
the
same
inundation
was
not
deep
not
past
forty
foot
in
most
places
from
the
ground
so
that
although
it
destroyed
man
and
beast
generally
yet
some
few
wild
inhabitants
of
the
wood
escaped
birds
also
were
saved
by
flying
to
the
high
trees
and
woods
for
as
for
men
although
they
had
buildings
in
many
places
higher
than
the
depth
of
the
water
yet
that
inundation
though
it
were
shallow
had
a
long
continuance
whereby
they
of
the
vale
that
were
not
drowned
perished
for
want
of
food
and
other
things
necessary
so
as
marvel
you
not
at
the
thin
population
of
america
nor
at
the
rudeness
and
ignorance
of
the
people
for
you
must
account
your
inhabitants
of
america
as
a
young
people
younger
a
thousand
years
at
the
least
than
the
rest
of
the
world
for
that
there
was
so
much
time
between
the
universal
flood
and
their
particular
inundation
for
the
poor
remnant
of
human
seed
which
remained
in
their
mountains
peopled
the
country
again
slowly
by
little
and
little
and
being
simple
and
savage
people
not
like
noah
and
his
sons
which
was
the
chief
family
of
the
earth
they
were
not
able
to
leave
letters
arts
and
civility
to
their
posterity
and
having
likewise
in
their
mountainous
habitations
been
used
in
respect
of
the
extreme
cold
of
those
regions
to
clothe
themselves
with
the
skins
of
tigers
bears
and
great
hairy
goats
that
they
have
in
those
parts
when
after
they
came
down
into
the
valley
and
found
the
intolerable
heats
which
are
there
and
knew
no
means
of
lighter
apparel
they
were
forced
to
begin
the
custom
of
going
naked
which
continueth
at
this
day
only
they
take
great
pride
and
delight
in
the
feathers
of
birds
and
this
also
they
took
from
those
their
ancestors
of
the
mountains
who
were
invited
unto
it
by
the
infinite
flights
of
birds
that
came
up
to
the
high
grounds
while
the
waters
stood
below
so
you
see
by
this
main
accident
of
time
we
lost
our
traffic
with
the
americans
with
whom
of
all
others
in
regard
they
lay
nearest
to
us
we
had
most
commerce
as
for
the
other
parts
of
the
world
it
is
most
manifest
that
in
the
ages
following
whether
it
were
in
respect
of
wars
or
by
a
natural
revolution
of
time
navigation
did
every
where
greatly
decay
and
specially
far
voyages
the
rather
by
the
use
of
galleys
and
such
vessels
as
could
hardly
brook
the
ocean
were
altogether
left
and
omitted
so
then
that
part
of
intercourse
which
could
be
from
other
nations
to
sail
to
us
you
see
how
it
hath
long
since
ceased
except
it
were
by
some
rare
accident
as
this
of
yours
but
now
of
the
cessation
of
that
other
part
of
intercourse
which
might
be
by
our
sailing
to
other
nations
i
must
yield
you
some
other
cause
for
i
can
not
say
if
i
shall
say
truly
but
our
shipping
for
number
strength
mariners
pilots
and
all
things
that
appertain
to
navigation
is
as
great
as
ever
and
therefore
why
we
should
sit
at
home
i
shall
now
give
you
an
account
by
itself
and
it
will
draw
nearer
to
give
you
satisfaction
to
your
principal
question
there
reigned
in
this
land
about
nineteen
hundred
years
ago
a
king
whose
memory
of
all
others
we
most
adore
not
superstitiously
but
as
a
divine
instrument
though
a
mortal
man
his
name
was
solamona
and
we
esteem
him
as
the
lawgiver
of
our
nation
this
king
had
a
large
heart
inscrutable
for
good
and
was
wholly
bent
to
make
his
kingdom
and
people
happy
he
therefore
taking
into
consideration
how
sufficient
and
substantive
this
land
was
to
maintain
itself
without
any
aid
at
all
of
the
foreigner
being
five
thousand
six
hundred
miles
in
circuit
and
of
rare
fertility
of
soil
in
the
greatest
part
thereof
and
finding
also
the
shipping
of
this
country
might
be
plentifully
set
on
work
both
by
fishing
and
by
transportations
from
port
to
port
and
likewise
by
sailing
unto
some
small
islands
that
are
not
far
from
us
and
are
under
the
crown
and
laws
of
this
state
and
recalling
into
his
memory
the
happy
and
flourishing
estate
wherein
this
land
then
was
so
as
it
might
be
a
thousand
ways
altered
to
the
worse
but
scarce
any
one
way
to
the
better
thought
nothing
wanted
to
his
noble
and
heroical
intentions
but
only
as
far
as
human
foresight
might
reach
to
give
perpetuity
to
that
which
was
in
his
time
so
happily
established
therefore
amongst
his
other
fundamental
laws
of
this
kingdom
he
did
ordain
the
interdicts
and
prohibitions
which
we
have
touching
entrance
of
strangers
which
at
that
time
though
it
was
after
the
calamity
of
america
was
frequent
doubting
novelties
and
commixture
of
manners
it
is
true
the
like
law
against
the
admission
of
strangers
without
licence
is
an
ancient
law
in
the
kingdom
of
china
and
yet
continued
in
use
but
there
it
is
a
poor
thing
and
hath
made
them
a
curious
ignorant
fearful
foolish
nation
but
our
lawgiver
made
his
law
of
another
temper
for
first
he
hath
preserved
all
points
of
humanity
in
taking
order
and
making
provision
for
the
relief
of
strangers
distressed
whereof
you
have
tasted
at
which
speech
as
reason
was
we
all
rose
up
and
bowed
ourselves
he
went
on
that
king
also
still
desiring
to
join
humanity
and
policy
together
and
thinking
it
against
humanity
to
detain
strangers
here
against
their
wills
and
against
policy
that
they
should
return
and
discover
their
knowledge
of
this
estate
he
took
this
course
he
did
ordain
that
of
the
strangers
that
should
be
permitted
to
land
as
many
at
all
times
might
depart
as
would
but
as
many
as
would
stay
should
have
very
good
conditions
and
means
to
live
from
the
state
wherein
he
saw
so
far
that
now
in
so
many
ages
since
the
prohibition
we
have
memory
not
of
one
ship
that
ever
returned
and
but
of
thirteen
persons
only
at
several
times
that
chose
to
return
in
our
bottoms
what
those
few
that
returned
may
have
reported
abroad
i
know
not
but
you
must
think
whatsoever
they
have
said
could
be
taken
where
they
came
but
for
a
dream
now
for
our
travelling
from
henna
into
parts
abroad
our
lawgiver
thought
fit
altogether
to
restrain
it
so
is
it
not
in
china
for
the
chinese
sail
where
they
will
or
can
which
sheweth
that
their
law
of
keeping
out
strangers
is
a
law
of
pusillanimity
and
fear
but
this
restraint
of
ours
hath
one
only
exception
which
is
admirable
preserving
the
good
which
cometh
by
communicating
with
strangers
and
avoiding
the
hurt
and
i
will
now
open
it
to
you
and
here
i
shall
seem
a
little
to
digress
but
you
will
by
and
by
find
it
pertinent
ye
shall
understand
my
dear
friends
that
amongst
the
excellent
acts
of
that
king
one
above
all
hath
the
it
was
the
erection
and
institution
of
an
order
or
society
which
we
call
salomon
house
the
noblest
foundation
as
we
think
that
ever
was
upon
the
earth
and
the
lanthorn
of
this
kingdom
it
is
dedicated
to
the
study
of
the
works
and
creatures
of
god
some
think
it
beareth
the
founder
name
a
little
corrupted
as
if
it
should
be
solamona
house
but
the
records
write
it
as
it
is
spoken
so
as
i
take
it
to
be
denominate
of
the
king
of
the
hebrews
which
is
famous
with
you
and
no
stranger
to
us
for
we
have
some
parts
of
his
works
which
with
you
are
lost
namely
that
natural
history
which
he
wrote
of
all
plants
from
the
cedar
of
libanus
to
the
moss
that
groweth
out
of
the
wall
and
of
all
things
that
have
life
and
motion
this
maketh
me
think
that
our
king
finding
himself
to
symbolize
in
many
things
with
that
king
of
the
hebrews
which
lived
many
years
before
him
honored
him
with
the
title
of
this
foundation
and
i
am
rather
induced
to
be
of
this
opinion
for
that
i
find
in
ancient
records
this
order
or
society
is
sometimes
called
salomon
house
and
sometimes
the
college
of
the
six
days
works
whereby
i
am
satisfied
that
our
excellent
king
had
learned
from
the
hebrews
that
god
had
created
the
world
and
all
that
therein
is
within
six
days
and
therefore
he
instituting
that
house
for
the
finding
out
of
the
true
nature
of
all
things
whereby
god
might
have
the
more
glory
in
the
workmanship
of
them
and
insert
the
more
fruit
in
the
use
of
them
did
give
it
also
that
second
name
but
now
to
come
to
our
present
purpose
when
the
king
had
forbidden
to
all
his
people
navigation
into
any
part
that
was
not
under
his
crown
he
made
nevertheless
this
ordinance
that
every
twelve
years
there
should
be
set
forth
out
of
this
kingdom
two
ships
appointed
to
several
voyages
that
in
either
of
these
ships
there
should
be
a
mission
of
three
of
the
fellows
or
brethren
of
salomon
house
whose
errand
was
only
to
give
us
knowledge
of
the
affairs
and
state
of
those
countries
to
which
they
were
designed
and
especially
of
the
sciences
arts
manufactures
and
inventions
of
all
the
world
and
withal
to
bring
unto
us
books
instruments
and
patterns
in
every
kind
that
the
ships
after
they
had
landed
the
brethren
should
return
and
that
the
brethren
should
stay
abroad
till
the
new
mission
these
ships
are
not
otherwise
fraught
than
with
store
of
victuals
and
good
quantity
of
treasure
to
remain
with
the
brethren
for
the
buying
of
such
things
and
rewarding
of
such
persons
as
they
should
think
fit
now
for
me
to
tell
you
how
the
vulgar
sort
of
mariners
are
contained
from
being
discovered
at
land
and
how
they
that
must
be
put
on
shore
for
any
time
color
themselves
under
the
names
of
other
nations
and
to
what
places
these
voyages
have
been
designed
and
what
places
of
rendezvous
are
appointed
for
the
new
missions
and
the
like
circumstances
of
the
practique
i
may
not
do
it
neither
is
it
much
to
your
desire
but
thus
you
see
we
maintain
a
trade
not
for
gold
silver
or
jewels
nor
for
silks
nor
for
spices
nor
any
other
commodity
of
matter
but
only
for
god
first
creature
which
was
light
to
have
light
i
say
of
the
growth
of
all
parts
of
the
world
and
when
he
had
said
this
he
was
silent
and
so
were
we
all
for
indeed
we
were
all
astonished
to
hear
so
strange
things
so
probably
told
and
he
perceiving
that
we
were
willing
to
say
somewhat
but
had
it
not
ready
in
great
courtesy
took
us
off
and
descended
to
ask
us
questions
of
our
voyage
and
fortunes
and
in
the
end
concluded
that
we
might
do
well
to
think
with
ourselves
what
time
of
stay
we
would
demand
of
the
state
and
bade
us
not
to
scant
ourselves
for
he
would
procure
such
time
as
we
desired
whereupon
we
all
rose
up
and
presented
ourselves
to
kiss
the
skirt
of
his
tippet
but
he
would
not
suffer
us
and
so
took
his
leave
but
when
it
came
once
amongst
our
people
that
the
state
used
to
offer
conditions
to
strangers
that
would
stay
we
had
work
enough
to
get
any
of
our
men
to
look
to
our
ship
and
to
keep
them
from
going
presently
to
the
governor
to
crave
conditions
but
with
much
ado
we
refrained
them
till
we
might
agree
what
course
to
take
we
took
ourselves
now
for
free
men
seeing
there
was
no
danger
of
our
utter
perdition
and
lived
most
joyfully
going
abroad
and
seeing
what
was
to
be
seen
in
the
city
and
places
adjacent
within
our
tedder
and
obtaining
acquaintance
with
many
of
the
city
not
of
the
meanest
quality
at
whose
hands
we
found
such
humanity
and
such
a
freedom
and
desire
to
take
strangers
as
it
were
into
their
bosom
as
was
enough
to
make
us
forget
all
that
was
dear
to
us
in
our
own
countries
and
continually
we
met
with
many
things
right
worthy
of
observation
and
relation
as
indeed
if
there
be
a
mirror
in
the
world
worthy
to
hold
men
eyes
it
is
that
country
one
day
there
were
two
of
our
company
bidden
to
a
feast
of
the
family
as
they
call
it
a
most
natural
pious
and
reverend
custom
it
is
shewing
that
nation
to
be
compounded
of
all
goodness
this
is
the
manner
of
it
it
is
granted
to
any
man
that
shall
live
to
see
thirty
persons
descended
of
his
body
alive
together
and
all
above
three
years
old
to
make
this
feast
which
is
done
at
the
cost
of
the
state
the
father
of
the
family
whom
they
call
the
tirsan
two
days
before
the
feast
taketh
to
him
three
of
such
friends
as
he
liketh
to
choose
and
is
assisted
also
by
the
governor
of
the
city
or
place
where
the
feast
is
celebrated
and
all
the
persons
of
the
family
of
both
sexes
are
summoned
to
attend
him
these
two
days
the
tirsan
sitteth
in
consultation
concerning
the
good
estate
of
the
family
there
if
there
be
any
discord
or
suits
between
any
of
the
family
they
are
compounded
and
appeased
there
if
any
of
the
family
be
distressed
or
decayed
order
is
taken
for
their
relief
and
competent
means
to
live
there
if
any
be
subject
to
vice
or
take
ill
courses
they
are
reproved
and
censured
so
likewise
direction
is
given
touching
marriages
and
the
courses
of
life
which
any
of
them
should
take
with
divers
other
the
like
orders
and
advices
the
governor
assisteth
to
the
end
to
put
in
execution
by
his
public
authority
the
decrees
and
orders
of
the
tirsan
if
they
should
be
disobeyed
though
that
seldom
needeth
such
reverence
and
obedience
they
give
to
the
order
of
nature
the
tirsan
doth
also
then
ever
choose
one
man
from
among
his
sons
to
live
in
house
with
him
who
is
called
ever
after
the
son
of
the
vine
the
reason
will
hereafter
appear
on
the
feast
day
the
father
or
tirsan
cometh
forth
after
divine
service
into
a
large
room
where
the
feast
is
celebrated
which
room
hath
an
at
the
upper
end
against
the
wall
in
the
middle
of
the
is
a
chair
placed
for
him
with
a
table
and
carpet
before
it
over
the
chair
is
a
state
made
round
or
oval
and
it
is
of
ivy
an
ivy
somewhat
whiter
than
ours
like
the
leaf
of
a
silver
asp
but
more
shining
for
it
is
green
all
winter
and
the
state
is
curiously
wrought
with
silver
and
silk
of
divers
colors
broiding
or
binding
in
the
ivy
and
is
ever
of
the
work
of
some
of
the
daughters
of
the
family
and
veiled
over
at
the
top
with
a
fine
net
of
silk
and
silver
but
the
substance
of
it
is
true
ivy
whereof
after
it
is
taken
down
the
friends
of
the
family
are
desirous
to
have
some
leaf
or
sprig
to
keep
the
tirsan
cometh
forth
with
all
his
generation
or
linage
the
males
before
him
and
the
females
following
him
and
if
there
be
a
mother
from
whose
body
the
whole
linage
is
descended
there
is
a
traverse
placed
in
a
loft
above
on
the
right
hand
of
the
chair
with
a
privy
door
and
a
carved
window
of
glass
leaded
with
gold
and
blue
where
she
sitteth
but
is
not
seen
when
the
tirsan
is
come
forth
he
sitteth
down
in
the
chair
and
all
the
linage
place
themselves
against
the
wall
both
at
his
back
and
upon
the
return
of
the
in
order
of
their
years
without
difference
of
sex
and
stand
upon
their
feet
when
he
is
set
the
room
being
always
full
of
company
but
well
kept
and
without
disorder
after
some
pause
there
cometh
in
from
the
lower
end
of
the
room
a
taratan
which
is
as
much
as
an
herald
and
on
either
side
of
him
two
young
lads
whereof
one
carrieth
a
scroll
of
their
shining
yellow
parchment
and
the
other
a
cluster
of
grapes
of
gold
with
a
long
foot
or
stalk
the
herald
and
children
are
clothed
with
mantles
of
green
satin
but
the
herald
mantle
is
streamed
with
gold
and
hath
a
train
then
the
herald
with
three
curtesies
or
rather
inclinations
cometh
up
as
far
as
the
and
there
first
taketh
into
his
hand
the
scroll
this
scroll
is
the
king
charter
containing
gifts
of
revenew
and
many
privileges
exemptions
and
points
of
honour
granted
to
the
father
of
the
family
and
is
ever
styled
and
directed
to
such
do
one
our
well
beloved
friend
and
creditor
which
is
a
title
proper
only
to
this
case
for
they
say
the
king
is
debtor
to
no
man
but
for
propagation
of
his
subjects
the
seal
set
to
the
king
charter
is
the
king
image
imbossed
or
moulded
in
gold
and
though
such
charters
be
expedited
of
course
and
as
of
right
yet
they
are
varied
by
discretion
according
to
the
number
and
dignity
of
the
family
this
charter
the
herald
readeth
aloud
and
while
it
is
read
the
father
or
tirsan
standeth
up
supported
by
two
of
his
sons
such
as
he
chooseth
then
the
herald
mounteth
the
and
delivereth
the
charter
into
his
hand
and
with
that
there
is
an
acclamation
by
all
that
are
present
in
their
language
which
is
thus
much
happy
are
the
people
of
bensalem
then
the
herald
taketh
into
his
hand
from
the
other
child
the
cluster
of
grapes
which
is
of
gold
both
the
stalk
and
the
grapes
but
the
grapes
are
daintily
enamelled
and
if
the
males
of
the
family
be
the
greater
number
the
grapes
are
enamelled
purple
with
a
little
sun
set
on
the
top
if
the
females
then
they
are
enamelled
into
a
greenish
yellow
with
a
crescent
on
the
top
the
grapes
are
in
number
as
many
as
there
are
descendants
of
the
family
this
golden
cluster
the
herald
delivereth
also
to
the
tirsan
who
presently
delivereth
it
over
to
that
son
that
he
had
formerly
chosen
to
be
in
house
with
him
who
beareth
it
before
his
father
as
an
ensign
of
honour
when
he
goeth
in
public
ever
after
and
is
thereupon
called
the
son
of
the
vine
after
the
ceremony
endeth
the
father
or
tirsan
retireth
and
after
some
time
cometh
forth
again
to
dinner
where
he
sitteth
alone
under
the
state
as
before
and
none
of
his
descendants
sit
with
him
of
what
degree
or
dignity
soever
except
he
hap
to
be
of
salomon
house
he
is
served
only
by
his
own
children
such
as
are
male
who
perform
unto
him
all
service
of
the
table
upon
the
knee
and
the
women
only
stand
about
him
leaning
against
the
wall
the
room
below
the
hath
tables
on
the
sides
for
the
guests
that
are
bidden
who
are
served
with
great
and
comely
order
and
towards
the
end
of
dinner
which
in
the
greatest
feasts
with
them
lasteth
never
above
an
hour
and
an
half
there
is
an
hymn
sung
varied
according
to
the
invention
of
him
that
composeth
it
for
they
have
excellent
posy
but
the
subject
of
it
is
always
the
praises
of
adam
and
noah
and
abraham
whereof
the
former
two
peopled
the
world
and
the
last
was
the
father
of
the
faithful
concluding
ever
with
a
thanksgiving
for
the
nativity
of
our
saviour
in
whose
birth
the
births
of
all
are
only
blessed
dinner
being
done
the
tirsan
retireth
again
and
having
withdrawn
himself
alone
into
a
place
where
he
makes
some
private
prayers
he
cometh
forth
the
third
time
to
give
the
blessing
with
all
his
descendants
who
stand
about
him
as
at
the
first
then
he
calleth
them
forth
by
one
and
by
one
by
name
as
he
pleaseth
though
seldom
the
order
of
age
be
inverted
the
person
that
is
called
the
table
being
before
removed
kneeleth
down
before
the
chair
and
the
father
layeth
his
hand
upon
his
head
or
her
head
and
giveth
the
blessing
in
these
words
son
of
bensalem
or
daughter
of
bensalem
thy
father
with
it
the
man
by
whom
thou
hast
breath
and
life
speaketh
the
word
the
blessing
of
the
everlasting
father
the
prince
of
peace
and
the
holy
dove
be
upon
thee
and
make
the
days
of
thy
pilgrimage
good
and
many
this
he
saith
to
every
of
them
and
that
done
if
there
be
any
of
his
sons
of
eminent
merit
and
virtue
so
they
be
not
above
two
he
calleth
for
them
again
and
saith
laying
his
arm
over
their
shoulders
they
standing
sons
it
is
well
ye
are
born
give
god
the
praise
and
persevere
to
the
end
and
withall
delivereth
to
either
of
them
a
jewel
made
in
the
figure
of
an
ear
of
wheat
which
they
ever
after
wear
in
the
front
of
their
turban
or
hat
this
done
they
fall
to
music
and
dances
and
other
recreations
after
their
manner
for
the
rest
of
the
day
this
is
the
full
order
of
that
feast
by
that
time
six
or
seven
days
were
spent
i
was
fallen
into
straight
acquaintance
with
a
merchant
of
that
city
whose
name
was
joabin
he
was
a
jew
and
circumcised
for
they
have
some
few
stirps
of
jews
yet
remaining
among
them
whom
they
leave
to
their
own
religion
which
they
may
the
better
do
because
they
are
of
a
far
differing
disposition
from
the
jews
in
other
parts
for
whereas
they
hate
the
name
of
christ
and
have
a
secret
inbred
rancour
against
the
people
among
whom
they
live
these
contrariwise
give
unto
our
saviour
many
high
attributes
and
love
the
nation
of
bensalem
extremely
surely
this
man
of
whom
i
speak
would
ever
acknowledge
that
christ
was
born
of
a
virgin
and
that
he
was
more
than
a
man
and
he
would
tell
how
god
made
him
ruler
of
the
seraphims
which
guard
his
throne
and
they
call
him
also
the
milken
way
and
the
eliah
of
the
messiah
and
many
other
high
names
which
though
they
be
inferior
to
his
divine
majesty
yet
they
are
far
from
the
language
of
other
jews
and
for
the
country
of
bensalem
this
man
would
make
no
end
of
commending
it
being
desirous
by
tradition
among
the
jews
there
to
have
it
believed
that
the
people
thereof
were
of
the
generations
of
abraham
by
another
son
whom
they
call
nachoran
and
that
moses
by
a
secret
cabala
ordained
the
laws
of
bensalem
which
they
now
use
and
that
when
the
messiah
should
come
and
sit
in
his
throne
at
hierusalem
the
king
of
bensalem
should
sit
at
his
feet
whereas
other
kings
should
keep
a
great
distance
but
yet
setting
aside
these
jewish
dreams
the
man
was
a
wise
man
and
learned
and
of
great
policy
and
excellently
seen
in
the
laws
and
customs
of
that
nation
amongst
other
discourses
one
day
i
told
him
i
was
much
affected
with
the
relation
i
had
from
some
of
the
company
of
their
custom
in
holding
the
feast
of
the
family
for
that
methought
i
had
never
heard
of
a
solemnity
wherein
nature
did
so
much
preside
and
because
propagation
of
families
proceedeth
from
the
nuptial
copulation
i
desired
to
know
of
him
what
laws
and
customs
they
had
concerning
marriage
and
whether
they
kept
marriage
well
and
whether
they
were
tied
to
one
wife
for
that
where
population
is
so
much
affected
and
such
as
with
them
it
seemed
to
be
there
is
commonly
permission
of
plurality
of
wives
to
this
he
said
you
have
reason
for
to
commend
that
excellent
institution
of
the
feast
of
the
family
and
indeed
we
have
experience
that
those
families
that
are
partakers
of
the
blessing
of
that
feast
do
flourish
and
prosper
ever
after
in
an
extraordinary
manner
but
hear
me
now
and
i
will
tell
you
what
i
know
you
shall
understand
that
there
is
not
under
the
heavens
so
chaste
a
nation
as
this
of
bensalem
nor
so
free
from
all
pollution
or
foulness
it
is
the
virgin
of
the
world
i
remember
i
have
read
in
one
of
your
european
books
of
an
holy
hermit
amongst
you
that
desired
to
see
the
spirit
of
fornication
and
there
appeared
to
him
a
little
foul
ugly
aethiop
but
if
he
had
desired
to
see
the
spirit
of
chastity
of
bensalem
it
would
have
appeared
to
him
in
the
likeness
of
a
fair
beautiful
cherubim
for
there
is
nothing
amongst
mortal
men
more
fair
and
admirable
than
the
chaste
minds
of
this
people
know
therefore
that
with
them
there
are
no
stews
no
dissolute
houses
no
courtesans
nor
anything
of
that
kind
nay
they
wonder
with
detestation
at
you
in
europe
which
permit
such
things
they
say
ye
have
put
marriage
out
of
office
for
marriage
is
ordained
a
remedy
for
unlawful
concupiscence
and
natural
concupiscence
seemeth
as
a
spar
to
marriage
but
when
men
have
at
hand
a
remedy
more
agreeable
to
their
corrupt
will
marriage
is
almost
expulsed
and
therefore
there
are
with
you
seen
infinite
men
that
marry
not
but
chose
rather
a
libertine
and
impure
single
life
than
to
be
yoked
in
marriage
and
many
that
do
marry
marry
late
when
the
prime
and
strength
of
their
years
is
past
and
when
they
do
marry
what
is
marriage
to
them
but
a
very
bargain
wherein
is
sought
alliance
or
portion
or
reputation
with
some
desire
almost
indifferent
of
issue
and
not
the
faithful
nuptial
union
of
man
and
wife
that
was
first
instituted
neither
is
it
possible
that
those
that
have
cast
away
so
basely
so
much
of
their
strength
should
greatly
esteem
children
being
of
the
same
matter
as
chaste
men
do
so
likewise
during
marriage
is
the
case
much
amended
as
it
ought
to
be
if
those
things
were
tolerated
only
for
necessity
no
but
they
remain
still
as
a
very
affront
to
marriage
the
haunting
of
those
dissolute
places
or
resort
to
courtesans
are
no
more
punished
in
married
men
than
in
bachelors
and
the
depraved
custom
of
change
and
the
delight
in
meretricious
embracements
where
sin
is
turned
into
art
maketh
marriage
a
dull
thing
and
a
kind
of
imposition
or
tax
they
hear
you
defend
these
things
as
done
to
avoid
greater
evils
as
advoutries
deflowering
of
virgins
unnatural
lust
and
the
like
but
they
say
this
is
a
preposterous
wisdom
and
they
call
it
lot
offer
who
to
save
his
guests
from
abusing
offered
his
daughters
nay
they
say
farther
that
there
is
little
gained
in
this
for
that
the
same
vices
and
appetites
do
still
remain
and
abound
unlawful
lust
being
like
a
furnace
that
if
you
stop
the
flames
altogether
it
will
quench
but
if
you
give
it
any
vent
it
will
rage
as
for
masculine
love
they
have
no
touch
of
it
and
yet
there
are
not
so
faithful
and
inviolate
friendships
in
the
world
again
as
are
there
and
to
speak
generally
as
i
said
before
i
have
not
read
of
any
such
chastity
in
any
people
as
theirs
and
their
usual
saying
is
that
whosoever
is
unchaste
can
not
reverence
himself
and
they
say
that
the
reverence
of
a
man
self
is
next
to
religion
the
chiefest
bridle
of
all
vices
and
when
he
had
said
this
the
good
jew
paused
a
little
whereupon
i
far
more
willing
to
hear
him
speak
on
than
to
speak
myself
yet
thinking
it
decent
that
upon
his
pause
of
speech
i
should
not
be
altogether
silent
said
only
this
that
i
would
say
to
him
as
the
widow
of
sarepta
said
to
elias
that
he
was
come
to
bring
to
memory
our
sins
and
that
i
confess
the
righteousness
of
bensalem
was
greater
than
the
righteousness
of
europe
at
which
speech
he
bowed
his
head
and
went
on
in
this
manner
they
have
also
many
wise
and
excellent
laws
touching
marriage
they
allow
no
polygamy
they
have
ordained
that
none
do
intermarry
or
contract
until
a
month
be
past
from
their
first
interview
marriage
without
consent
of
parents
they
do
not
make
void
but
they
mulct
it
in
the
inheritors
for
the
children
of
such
marriages
are
not
admitted
to
inherit
above
a
third
part
of
their
parents
inheritance
i
have
read
in
a
book
of
one
of
your
men
of
a
feigned
commonwealth
where
the
married
couple
are
permitted
before
they
contract
to
see
one
another
naked
this
they
dislike
for
they
think
it
a
scorn
to
give
a
refusal
after
so
familiar
knowledge
but
because
of
many
hidden
defects
in
men
and
women
bodies
they
have
a
more
civil
way
for
they
have
near
every
town
a
couple
of
pools
which
they
call
adam
and
eve
pools
where
it
is
permitted
to
one
of
the
friends
of
the
men
and
another
of
the
friends
of
the
woman
to
see
them
severally
bathe
naked
and
as
we
were
thus
in
conference
there
came
one
that
seemed
to
be
a
messenger
in
a
rich
huke
that
spake
with
the
jew
whereupon
he
turned
to
me
and
said
you
will
pardon
me
for
i
am
commanded
away
in
haste
the
next
morning
he
came
to
me
again
joyful
as
it
seemed
and
said
there
is
word
come
to
the
governor
of
the
city
that
one
of
the
fathers
of
salomon
house
will
be
here
this
day
we
have
seen
none
of
them
this
dozen
years
his
coming
is
in
state
but
the
cause
of
his
coming
is
secret
i
will
provide
you
and
your
fellows
of
a
good
standing
to
see
his
entry
i
thanked
him
and
told
him
i
was
most
glad
of
the
news
the
day
being
come
he
made
his
entry
he
was
a
man
of
middle
stature
and
age
comely
of
person
and
had
an
aspect
as
if
he
pitied
men
he
was
clothed
in
a
robe
of
fine
black
cloth
with
wide
sleeves
and
a
cape
his
under
garment
was
of
excellent
white
linen
down
to
the
foot
girt
with
a
girdle
of
the
same
and
a
sindon
or
tippet
of
the
same
about
his
neck
he
had
gloves
that
were
curious
and
set
with
stone
and
shoes
of
velvet
his
neck
was
bare
to
the
shoulders
his
hat
was
like
a
helmet
or
spanish
montera
and
his
locks
curled
below
it
decently
they
were
of
colour
brown
his
beard
was
cut
round
and
of
the
same
colour
with
his
hair
somewhat
lighter
he
was
carried
in
a
rich
chariot
without
wheels
with
two
horses
at
either
end
richly
trapped
in
blue
velvet
embroidered
and
two
footmen
on
each
side
in
the
like
attire
the
chariot
was
all
of
cedar
gilt
and
adorned
with
crystal
save
that
the
had
panels
of
sapphires
set
in
borders
of
gold
and
the
the
like
of
emeralds
of
the
peru
colour
there
was
also
a
sun
of
gold
radiant
upon
the
top
in
the
midst
and
on
the
top
before
a
small
cherub
of
gold
with
wings
displayed
the
chariot
was
covered
with
cloth
of
gold
tissued
upon
blue
he
had
before
him
fifty
attendants
young
men
all
in
white
satin
loose
coats
to
the
mid
leg
and
stockings
of
white
silk
and
shoes
of
blue
velvet
and
hats
of
blue
velvet
with
fine
plumes
of
diverse
colours
set
round
like
next
before
the
chariot
went
two
men
in
linen
garments
down
the
foot
girt
and
shoes
of
blue
velvet
who
carried
the
one
a
crosier
the
other
a
pastoral
staff
like
a
neither
of
them
of
metal
but
the
crosier
of
the
pastoral
staff
of
cedar
horsemen
he
had
none
neither
before
nor
behind
his
chariot
as
it
seemeth
to
avoid
all
tumult
and
trouble
behind
his
chariot
went
all
the
officers
and
principals
of
the
companies
of
the
city
he
sat
alone
upon
cushions
of
a
kind
of
excellent
plush
blue
and
under
his
foot
curious
carpets
of
silk
of
diverse
colours
like
the
persian
but
far
finer
he
held
up
his
bare
hand
as
he
went
as
blessing
the
people
but
in
silence
the
street
was
wonderfully
well
kept
so
that
there
was
never
any
army
had
their
men
stand
in
better
than
the
people
stood
the
windows
likewise
were
not
crowded
but
every
one
stood
in
them
as
if
they
had
been
placed
when
the
shew
was
past
the
jew
said
to
me
i
shall
not
be
able
to
attend
you
as
i
would
in
regard
of
some
charge
the
city
hath
laid
upon
me
for
the
entertaining
of
this
great
person
three
days
after
the
jew
came
to
me
again
and
said
ye
are
happy
men
for
the
father
of
salomon
house
taketh
knowledge
of
your
being
here
and
commanded
me
to
tell
you
that
he
will
admit
all
your
company
to
his
presence
and
have
private
conference
with
one
of
you
that
ye
shall
choose
and
for
this
hath
appointed
the
next
day
after
and
because
he
meaneth
to
give
you
his
blessing
he
hath
appointed
it
in
the
forenoon
we
came
at
our
day
and
hour
and
i
was
chosen
by
my
fellows
for
the
private
access
we
found
him
in
a
fair
chamber
richly
hanged
and
carpeted
under
foot
without
any
degrees
to
the
state
he
was
set
upon
a
low
throne
richly
adorned
and
a
rich
cloth
of
state
over
his
head
of
blue
satin
embroidered
he
was
alone
save
that
he
had
two
pages
of
honour
on
either
hand
one
finely
attired
in
white
his
under
garments
were
the
like
that
we
saw
him
wear
in
the
chariot
but
instead
of
his
gown
he
had
on
him
a
mantle
with
a
cape
of
the
same
fine
black
fastened
about
him
when
we
came
in
as
we
were
taught
we
bowed
low
at
our
first
entrance
and
when
we
were
come
near
his
chair
he
stood
up
holding
forth
his
hand
ungloved
and
in
posture
of
blessing
and
we
every
one
of
us
stooped
down
and
kissed
the
hem
of
his
tippet
that
done
the
rest
departed
and
i
remained
then
he
warned
the
pages
forth
of
the
room
and
caused
me
to
sit
down
beside
him
and
spake
to
me
thus
in
the
spanish
tongue
god
bless
thee
my
son
i
will
give
thee
the
greatest
jewel
i
have
for
i
will
impart
unto
thee
for
the
love
of
god
and
men
a
relation
of
the
true
state
of
salomon
house
son
to
make
you
know
the
true
state
of
salomon
house
i
will
keep
this
order
first
i
will
set
forth
unto
you
the
end
of
our
foundation
secondly
the
preparations
and
instruments
we
have
for
our
works
thirdly
the
several
employments
and
functions
whereto
our
fellows
are
assigned
and
fourthly
the
ordinances
and
rites
which
we
observe
the
end
of
our
foundation
is
the
knowledge
of
causes
and
secret
motions
of
things
and
the
enlarging
of
the
bounds
of
human
empire
to
the
effecting
of
all
things
possible
the
preparations
and
instruments
are
these
we
have
large
and
deep
caves
of
several
depths
the
deepest
are
sunk
six
hundred
fathom
and
some
of
them
are
digged
and
made
under
great
hills
and
mountains
so
that
if
you
reckon
together
the
depth
of
the
hill
and
the
depth
of
the
cave
they
are
some
of
them
above
three
miles
deep
for
we
find
that
the
depth
of
a
hill
and
the
depth
of
a
cave
from
the
flat
is
the
same
thing
both
remote
alike
from
the
sun
and
heaven
beams
and
from
the
open
air
these
caves
we
call
the
lower
region
and
we
use
them
for
all
coagulations
indurations
refrigerations
and
conservations
of
bodies
we
use
them
likewise
for
the
imitation
of
natural
mines
and
the
producing
also
of
new
artificial
metals
by
compositions
and
materials
which
we
use
and
lay
there
for
many
years
we
use
them
also
sometimes
which
may
seem
strange
for
curing
of
some
diseases
and
for
prolongation
of
life
in
some
hermits
that
choose
to
live
there
well
accommodated
of
all
things
necessary
and
indeed
live
very
long
by
whom
also
we
learn
many
things
we
have
burials
in
several
earths
where
we
put
diverse
cements
as
the
chineses
do
their
porcellain
but
we
have
them
in
greater
variety
and
some
of
them
more
fine
we
have
also
great
variety
of
composts
and
soils
for
the
making
of
the
earth
fruitful
we
have
high
towers
the
highest
about
half
a
mile
in
height
and
some
of
them
likewise
set
upon
high
mountains
so
that
the
vantage
of
the
hill
with
the
tower
is
in
the
highest
of
them
three
miles
at
least
and
these
places
we
call
the
upper
region
accounting
the
air
between
the
high
places
and
the
low
as
a
middle
region
we
use
these
towers
according
to
their
several
heights
and
situations
for
insolation
refrigeration
conservation
and
for
the
view
of
divers
meteors
as
winds
rain
snow
hail
and
some
of
the
fiery
meteors
also
and
upon
them
in
some
places
are
dwellings
of
hermits
whom
we
visit
sometimes
and
instruct
what
to
observe
we
have
great
lakes
both
salt
and
fresh
whereof
we
have
use
for
the
fish
and
fowl
we
use
them
also
for
burials
of
some
natural
bodies
for
we
find
a
difference
in
things
buried
in
earth
or
in
air
below
the
earth
and
things
buried
in
water
we
have
also
pools
of
which
some
do
strain
fresh
water
out
of
salt
and
others
by
art
do
turn
fresh
water
into
salt
we
have
also
some
rocks
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
and
some
bays
upon
the
shore
for
some
works
wherein
is
required
the
air
and
vapor
of
the
sea
we
have
likewise
violent
streams
and
cataracts
which
serve
us
for
many
motions
and
likewise
engines
for
multiplying
and
enforcing
of
winds
to
set
also
on
going
diverse
motions
we
have
also
a
number
of
artificial
wells
and
fountains
made
in
imitation
of
the
natural
sources
and
baths
as
tincted
upon
vitriol
sulphur
steel
brass
lead
nitre
and
other
minerals
and
again
we
have
little
wells
for
infusions
of
many
things
where
the
waters
take
the
virtue
quicker
and
better
than
in
vessels
or
basins
and
amongst
them
we
have
a
water
which
we
call
water
of
paradise
being
by
that
we
do
to
it
made
very
sovereign
for
health
and
prolongation
of
life
we
have
also
great
and
spacious
houses
where
we
imitate
and
demonstrate
meteors
as
snow
hail
rain
some
artificial
rains
of
bodies
and
not
of
water
thunders
lightnings
also
generations
of
bodies
in
air
as
frogs
flies
and
divers
others
we
have
also
certain
chambers
which
we
call
chambers
of
health
where
we
qualify
the
air
as
we
think
good
and
proper
for
the
cure
of
divers
diseases
and
preservation
of
health
we
have
also
fair
and
large
baths
of
several
mixtures
for
the
cure
of
diseases
and
the
restoring
of
man
body
from
arefaction
and
others
for
the
confirming
of
it
in
strength
of
sinewes
vital
parts
and
the
very
juice
and
substance
of
the
body
we
have
also
large
and
various
orchards
and
gardens
wherein
we
do
not
so
much
respect
beauty
as
variety
of
ground
and
soil
proper
for
divers
trees
and
herbs
and
some
very
spacious
where
trees
and
berries
are
set
whereof
we
make
divers
kinds
of
drinks
besides
the
vineyards
in
these
we
practise
likewise
all
conclusions
of
grafting
and
inoculating
as
well
of
as
which
produceth
many
effects
and
we
make
by
art
in
the
same
orchards
and
gardens
trees
and
flowers
to
come
earlier
or
later
than
their
seasons
and
to
come
up
and
bear
more
speedily
than
by
their
natural
course
they
do
we
make
them
also
by
art
greater
much
than
their
nature
and
their
fruit
greater
and
sweeter
and
of
differing
taste
smell
colour
and
figure
from
their
nature
and
many
of
them
we
so
order
as
they
become
of
medicinal
use
we
have
also
means
to
make
divers
plants
rise
by
mixtures
of
earths
without
seeds
and
likewise
to
make
divers
new
plants
differing
from
the
vulgar
and
to
make
one
tree
or
plant
turn
into
another
we
have
also
parks
and
enclosures
of
all
sorts
of
beasts
and
birds
which
we
use
not
only
for
view
or
rareness
but
likewise
for
dissections
and
trials
that
thereby
we
may
take
light
what
may
be
wrought
upon
the
body
of
man
wherein
we
find
many
strange
effects
as
continuing
life
in
them
though
divers
parts
which
you
account
vital
be
perished
and
taken
forth
resuscitating
of
some
that
seem
dead
in
appearance
and
the
like
we
try
also
all
poisons
and
other
medicines
upon
them
as
well
of
chirurgery
as
physic
by
art
likewise
we
make
them
greater
or
taller
than
their
kind
is
and
contrariwise
dwarf
them
and
stay
their
growth
we
make
them
more
fruitful
and
bearing
than
their
kind
is
and
contrariwise
barren
and
not
generative
also
we
make
them
differ
in
colour
shape
activity
many
ways
we
find
means
to
make
commixtures
and
copulations
of
different
kinds
which
have
produced
many
new
kinds
and
them
not
barren
as
the
general
opinion
is
we
make
a
number
of
kinds
of
serpents
worms
flies
fishes
of
putrefaction
whereof
some
are
advanced
in
effect
to
be
perfect
creatures
like
bests
or
birds
and
have
sexes
and
do
propagate
neither
do
we
this
by
chance
but
we
know
beforehand
of
what
matter
and
commixture
what
kind
of
those
creatures
will
arise
we
have
also
particular
pools
where
we
make
trials
upon
fishes
as
we
have
said
before
of
beasts
and
birds
we
have
also
places
for
breed
and
generation
of
those
kinds
of
worms
and
flies
which
are
of
special
use
such
as
are
with
you
your
and
bees
i
will
not
hold
you
long
with
recounting
of
our
brewhouses
and
kitchens
where
are
made
divers
drinks
breads
and
meats
rare
and
of
special
effects
wines
we
have
of
grapes
and
drinks
of
other
juice
of
fruits
of
grains
and
of
roots
and
of
mixtures
with
honey
sugar
manna
and
fruits
dried
and
decocted
also
of
the
tears
or
woundings
of
trees
and
of
the
pulp
of
canes
and
these
drinks
are
of
several
ages
some
to
the
age
or
last
of
forty
years
we
have
drinks
also
brewed
with
several
herbs
and
roots
and
spices
yea
with
several
fleshes
and
whereof
some
of
the
drinks
are
such
as
they
are
in
effect
meat
and
drink
both
so
that
divers
especially
in
age
do
desire
to
live
with
them
with
little
or
no
meat
or
bread
and
above
all
we
strive
to
have
drink
of
extreme
thin
parts
to
insinuate
into
the
body
and
yet
without
all
biting
sharpness
or
fretting
insomuch
as
some
of
them
put
upon
the
back
of
your
hand
will
with
a
little
stay
pass
through
to
the
palm
and
yet
taste
mild
to
the
mouth
we
have
also
waters
which
we
ripen
in
that
fashion
as
they
become
nourishing
so
that
they
are
indeed
excellent
drink
and
many
will
use
no
other
breads
we
have
of
several
grains
roots
and
kernels
yea
and
some
of
flesh
and
fish
dried
with
divers
kinds
of
leavenings
and
seasonings
so
that
some
do
extremely
move
appetites
some
do
nourish
so
as
divers
do
live
of
them
without
any
other
meat
who
live
very
long
so
for
meats
we
have
some
of
them
so
beaten
and
made
tender
and
mortified
yet
without
all
corrupting
as
a
weak
heat
of
the
stomach
will
turn
them
into
good
chylus
as
well
as
a
strong
heat
would
meat
otherwise
prepared
we
have
some
meats
also
and
breads
and
drinks
which
taken
by
men
enable
them
to
fast
long
after
and
some
other
that
used
make
the
very
flesh
of
men
bodies
more
hard
and
tough
and
their
strength
far
greater
than
otherwise
it
would
be
we
have
dispensatories
or
shops
of
medicines
wherein
you
may
easily
think
if
we
have
such
variety
of
plants
and
living
creatures
more
than
you
have
in
europe
for
we
know
what
you
have
the
simples
drugs
and
ingredients
of
medicines
must
likewise
be
in
so
much
the
greater
variety
we
have
them
likewise
of
divers
ages
and
long
fermentations
and
for
their
preparations
we
have
not
only
all
manner
of
exquisite
distillations
and
separations
and
especially
by
gentle
heats
and
percolations
through
divers
strainers
yea
and
substances
but
also
exact
forms
of
composition
whereby
they
incorporate
almost
as
they
were
natural
simples
we
have
also
divers
mechanical
arts
which
you
have
not
and
stuffs
made
by
them
as
papers
linen
silks
tissues
dainty
works
of
feathers
of
wonderful
lustre
excellent
dies
and
many
others
and
shops
likewise
as
well
for
such
as
are
not
brought
into
vulgar
use
amongst
us
as
for
those
that
are
for
you
must
know
that
of
the
things
before
recited
many
of
them
are
grown
into
use
throughout
the
kingdom
but
yet
if
they
did
flow
from
our
invention
we
have
of
them
also
for
patterns
and
principals
we
have
also
furnaces
of
great
diversities
and
that
keep
great
diversity
of
heats
fierce
and
quick
strong
and
constant
soft
and
mild
blown
quiet
dry
moist
and
the
like
but
above
all
we
have
heats
in
imitation
of
the
sun
and
heavenly
bodies
heats
that
pass
divers
inequalities
and
as
it
were
orbs
progresses
and
returns
whereby
we
produce
admirable
effects
besides
we
have
heats
of
dungs
and
of
bellies
and
maws
of
living
creatures
and
of
their
bloods
and
bodies
and
of
hays
and
herbs
laid
up
moist
of
lime
unquenched
and
such
like
instruments
also
which
generate
heat
only
by
motion
and
farther
places
for
strong
insulations
and
again
places
under
the
earth
which
by
nature
or
art
yield
heat
these
divers
heats
we
use
as
the
nature
of
the
operation
which
we
intend
requireth
we
have
also
where
we
make
demonstrations
of
all
lights
and
radiations
and
of
all
colours
and
out
of
things
uncoloured
and
transparent
we
can
represent
unto
you
all
several
colours
not
in
as
it
is
in
gems
and
prisms
but
of
themselves
single
we
represent
also
all
multiplications
of
light
which
we
carry
to
great
distance
and
make
so
sharp
as
to
discern
small
points
and
lines
also
all
colourations
of
light
all
delusions
and
deceits
of
the
sight
in
figures
magnitudes
motions
colours
all
demonstrations
of
shadows
we
find
also
divers
means
yet
unknown
to
you
of
producing
of
light
originally
from
divers
bodies
we
procure
means
of
seeing
objects
afar
off
as
in
the
heaven
and
remote
places
and
represent
things
near
as
afar
off
and
things
afar
off
as
near
making
feigned
distances
we
have
also
helps
for
the
sight
far
above
spectacles
and
glasses
in
use
we
have
also
glasses
and
means
to
see
small
and
minute
bodies
perfectly
and
distinctly
as
the
shapes
and
colours
of
small
flies
and
worms
grains
and
flaws
in
gems
which
can
not
otherwise
be
seen
observations
in
urine
and
blood
not
otherwise
to
be
seen
we
make
artificial
halo
and
circles
about
light
we
represent
also
all
manner
of
reflexions
refractions
and
multiplications
of
visual
beams
of
objects
we
have
also
precious
stones
of
all
kinds
many
of
them
of
great
beauty
and
to
you
unknown
crystals
likewise
and
glasses
of
divers
kinds
and
amongst
them
some
of
metals
vitrificated
and
other
materials
besides
those
of
which
you
make
glass
also
a
number
of
fossils
and
imperfect
minerals
which
you
have
not
likewise
loadstones
of
prodigious
virtue
and
other

artificial
we
have
also
where
we
practise
and
demonstrate
all
sounds
and
their
generation
we
have
harmonies

you
have
not
of
and
lesser
slides
of
sounds
divers
instruments
of

to
you
unknown
some
sweeter
than
any
you
have
together
with
bells
and
rings
that
are
dainty
and
sweet
we
represent
small
sounds
as
great
and
deep

sounds
extenuate
and
sharp
we
make
divers
tremblings
and
warblings
of
sounds
which
in
their
original
are
entire
we
represent
and
imitate
all
articulate
sounds
and
letters
and
the
voices
and
notes
of
beasts
and
birds
we
have
certain
helps
which
set
to
the
ear
do
further
the
hearing
greatly
we
have
also
divers
strange
and
artificial
echoes
reflecting
the
voice
many
times
and
as
it
were
tossing
it
and
some
that
give
back
the
voice
louder
than
it
came
some
shriller
and
some
deeper
yea
some
rendering
the
voice
differing
in
the
letters
or
articulate
sound
from
that
they
receive
we
have
also
means
to
convey
sounds
in
trunks
and
pipes
in
strange
lines
and
distances
we
have
also
wherewith
we
join
also
practices
of
taste
we
multiply
smells
which
may
seem
strange
we
imitate
smells
making
all
smells
to
breathe
outs
of
other
mixtures
than
those
that
give
them
we
make
divers
imitations
of
taste
likewise
so
that
they
will
deceive
any
man
taste
and
in
this
house
we
contain
also
a
where
we
make
all
dry
and
moist
and
divers
pleasant
wines
milks
broths
and
sallets
in
far
greater
variety
than
you
have
we
have
also
where
are
prepared
engines
and
instruments
for
all
sorts
of
motions
there
we
imitate
and
practise
to
make
swifter
motions
than
any
you
have
either
out
of
your
muskets
or
any
engine
that
you
have
and
to
make
them
and
multiply
them
more
easily
and
with
small
force
by
wheels
and
other
means
and
to
make
them
stronger
and
more
violent
than
yours
are
exceeding
your
greatest
cannons
and
basilisks
we
represent
also
ordnance
and
instruments
of
war
and
engines
of
all
kinds
and
likewise
new
mixtures
and
compositions
of
burning
in
water
and
unquenchable
also
fireworks
of
all

also
and
supporters
we

images
of
men
beasts
birds
fishes
and
serpents
we
have
also
a
great
number
of
other
various
motions
strange
for
equality
fineness
and
subtilty
we
have
also
a
mathematical
house
where
are
represented
all
instruments
as
well
of
geometry
as
astronomy
exquisitely
made
we
have
also
houses
of
deceits
of
the
senses
where
we
represent
all
manner
of
feats
of
juggling
false
apparitions
impostures
and
illusions
and
their
fallacies
and
surely
you
will
easily
believe
that
we
that
have
so
many
things
truly
natural
which
induce
admiration
could
in
a
world
of
particulars
deceive
the
senses
if
we
would
disguise
those
things
and
labour
to
make
them
seem
more
miraculous
but
we
do
hate
all
impostures
and
lies
insomuch
as
we
have
severely
forbidden
it
to
all
our
fellows
under
pain
of
ignominy
and
fines
that
they
do
not
show
any
natural
work
or
thing
adorned
or
swelling
but
only
pure
as
it
is
and
without
all
affectation
of
strangeness
these
are
my
son
the
riches
of
salomon
house
for
the
several
employments
and
offices
of
our
fellows
we
have
twelve
that
sail
into
foreign
countries
under
the
names
of
other
nations
for
our
own
we
conceal
who
bring
us
the
books
and
abstracts
and
patterns
of
experiments
of
all
other
parts
these
we
call
merchants
of
light
we
have
three
that
collect
the
experiments
which
are
in
all
books
these
we
call
depredators
we
have
three
that
collect
the
experiments
of
all
mechanical
arts
and
also
of
liberal
sciences
and
also
of
practices
which
are
not
brought
into
arts
these
we
call
we
have
three
that
try
new
experiments
such
as
themselves
think
good
these
we
call
pioneers
or
miners
we
have
three
that
draw
the
experiments
of
the
former
four
into
titles
and
tables
to
give
the
better
light
for
the
drawing
of
observations
and
axioms
out
of
them
these
we
call
compilers
we
have
three
that
bend
themselves
looking
into
the
experiments
of
their
fellows
and
cast
about
how
to
draw
out
of
them
things
of
use
and
practise
for
man
life
and
knowledge
as
well
for
works
as
for
plain
demonstration
of
causes
means
of
natural
divinations
and
the
easy
and
clear
discovery
of
the
virtues
and
parts
of
bodies
these
we
call
or
benefactors
then
after
divers
meetings
and
consults
of
our
whole
number
to
consider
of
the
former
labours
and
collections
we
have
three
that
take
care
out
of
them
to
direct
new
experiments
of
a
higher
light
more
penetrating
into
nature
than
the
former
these
we
call
lamps
we
have
three
others
that
do
execute
the
experiments
so
directed
and
report
them
these
we
call
inoculators
lastly
we
have
three
that
raise
the
former
discoveries
by
experiments
into
greater
observations
axioms
and
aphorisms
these
we
call
interpreters
of
nature
we
have
also
as
you
must
think
novices
and
apprentices
that
the
succession
of
the
former
employed
men
do
not
fail
besides
a
great
number
of
servants
and
attendants
men
and
women
and
this
we
do
also
we
have
consultations
which
of
the
inventions
and
experiences
which
we
have
discovered
shall
be
published
and
which
not
and
take
all
an
oath
of
secrecy
for
the
concealing
of
those
which
we
think
fit
to
keep
secret
though
some
of
those
we
do
reveal
sometimes
to
the
state
and
some
not
for
our
ordinances
and
rites
we
have
two
very
long
and
fair
galleries
in
one
of
these
we
place
patterns
and
samples
of
all
manner
of
the
more
rare
and
excellent
inventions
in
the
other
we
place
the
statues
of
all
principal
inventors
there
we
have
the
statue
of
your
columbus
that
discovered
the
west
indies
also
the
inventor
of
ships
your
monk
that
was
the
inventor
of
ordnance
and
of
gunpowder
the
inventor
of
music
the
inventor
of
letters
the
inventor
of
printing
the
inventor
of
observations
of
astronomy
the
inventor
of
works
in
metal
the
inventor
of
glass
the
inventor
of
silk
of
the
worm
the
inventor
of
wine
the
inventor
of
corn
and
bread
the
inventor
of
sugars
and
all
these
by
more
certain
tradition
than
you
have
then
have
we
divers
inventors
of
our
own
of
excellent
works
which
since
you
have
not
seen
it
were
too
long
to
make
descriptions
of
them
and
besides
in
the
right
understanding
of
those
descriptions
you
might
easily
err
for
upon
every
invention
of
value
we
erect
a
statue
to
the
inventor
and
give
him
a
liberal
and
honourable
reward
these
statues
are
some
of
brass
some
of
marble
and
some
of
cedar
and
other
special
woods
gilt
and
adorned
some
of
iron
some
of
silver
some
of
gold
we
have
certain
hymns
and
services
which
we
say
daily
of
lord
and
thanks
to
god
for
his
marvellous
works
and
forms
of
prayers
imploring
his
aid
and
blessing
for
the
illumination
of
our
labours
and
the
turning
of
them
into
good
and
holy
uses
lastly
we
have
circuits
or
visits
of
divers
principal
cities
of
the
kingdom
where
as
it
cometh
to
pass
we
do
publish
such
new
profitable
inventions
as
we
think
good
and
we
do
also
declare
natural
divinations
of
diseases
plagues
hurtful
creatures
scarcity
tempests
earthquakes
great
inundations
comets
temperature
of
the
year
and
divers
other
things
and
we
give
counsel
thereupon
what
the
people
shall
do
for
the
prevention
and
remedy
of
them
and
when
he
had
said
this
he
stood
up
and
i
as
i
had
been
taught
kneeled
down
and
he
laid
his
right
hand
upon
my
head
and
said
god
bless
thee
my
son
and
god
bless
this
relation
which
i
have
made
i
give
thee
leave
to
publish
it
for
the
good
of
other
nations
for
we
here
are
in
god
bosom
a
land
unknown
and
so
he
left
me
having
assigned
a
value
of
about
two
thousand
ducats
for
a
bounty
to
me
and
my
fellows
for
they
give
great
largesses
where
they
come
upon
all
occasions
the
rest
was
not
perfected
