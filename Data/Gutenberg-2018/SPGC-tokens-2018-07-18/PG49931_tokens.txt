came
the
dark
they
lay
on
their
sides
facing
each
other
in
the
of
the
cave
he
could
see
the
sheen
of
her
eyes
the
slow
curve
of
her
waist
so
we
wait
she
said
and
we
have
to
be
very
careful
he
answered
he
likes
the
night
he
even
likes
us
right
now
waiting
for
us
to
come
out
to
give
him
the
pleasure
of
killing
us
killing
that
really
his
only
pleasure
she
rolled
onto
her
back
her
voice
was
soft
we
going
to
make
it
she
said
we
got
the
money
and
we
get
the
car
and
then
buenos
aires
paris
and
they
were
quiet
for
a
while
until
suddenly
he
heard
her
breath
begin
to
quicken
she
turned
toward
him
and
he
pulled
her
close
there
was
time
one
a
steady
april
rain
was
soaking
the
earth
it
had
been
bad
to
drive
through
until
dusk
came
in
the
it
was
hard
to
see
the
road
the
rain
was
heavy
enough
to
reflect
my
headlights
back
against
the
my
mileage
on
the
speedometer
told
me
i
could
be
very
far
from
hillston
when
i
saw
the
motel
sign
ahead
on
the
right
i
slowed
down
it
looked
fairly
new
i
turned
in
the
parking
area
was
paved
with
those
round
brown
pebbles
that
crunch
under
the
tires
i
parked
as
close
to
the
office
as
i
could
get
and
ran
from
the
car
into
the
office
a
woman
with
the
bright
cold
eyes
and
thin
sharp
movements
of
a
water
bird
rented
me
a
room
far
back
from
the
highway
sound
she
said
the
place
was
just
four
miles
from
the
hillston
city
limits
once
i
saw
the
room
i
decided
that
it
would
do
it
would
be
a
good
place
to
stay
while
i
did
what
had
to
be
done
in
hillston
i
stretched
out
on
the
bed
and
wondered
if
i
had
been
smart
to
use
my
right
name
on
the
motel
register
but
if
i
could
find
the
money
there
would
be
no
one
to
say
that
i
was
the
one
who
had
taken
it
and
using
my
right
name
would
make
any
difference
at
all
when
at
last
the
rain
eased
up
i
went
and
found
a
small
roadside
restaurant
the
girl
behind
the
counter
told
me
where
i
could
buy
a
bottle
of
liquor
she
seemed
open
to
any
invitation
to
help
me
drink
it
up
but
though
she
was
reasonably
pretty
i
was
not
interested
i
had
this
other
thing
on
my
mind
and
i
wanted
to
go
back
alone
and
have
some
drinks
and
think
about
it
and
wonder
how
i
could
do
it
maybe
you
saw
pictures
of
us
the
ones
who
were
really
bad
off
when
the
prisoners
were
exchanged
i
was
one
of
the
litter
cases
my
stomach
had
stopped
digesting
the
slop
they
fed
us
and
i
was
down
to
pounds
one
more
week
and
i
would
have
been
buried
up
there
beyond
the
river
like
so
many
others
were
i
was
in
bad
shape
not
only
physically
but
mentally
i
was
too
sick
to
be
flown
back
memory
was
all
shot
i
went
right
into
hospital
and
they
started
feeding
me
through
a
tube
it
was
during
the
months
in
the
military
hospital
back
in
this
country
that
i
began
to
sort
things
out
and
began
to
remember
more
of
the
details
about
timmy
warden
of
hillston
when
the
intelligence
people
had
interrogated
me
i
had
told
them
how
timmy
died
but
nothing
more
than
that
i
did
tell
them
any
of
the
stuff
timmy
had
told
me
we
were
both
captured
at
the
same
time
in
that
action
near
the
reservoir
i
known
him
casually
he
was
in
a
different
platoon
we
were
together
most
of
the
time
after
we
were
captured
enough
has
already
been
written
about
how
it
was
it
was
good
that
prison
camp
experience
can
change
your
attitude
toward
life
and
toward
yourself
it
did
that
to
timmy
warden
his
one
thought
was
to
survive
it
was
that
way
with
all
of
us
but
timmy
seemed
more
of
a
fanatic
than
anybody
else
he
had
to
get
back
he
told
me
about
it
one
night
that
was
after
he
gotten
pretty
weak
i
was
still
in
fair
shape
he
told
me
about
it
in
the
dark
whispering
to
me
i
could
see
his
face
tal
i
got
to
get
back
and
straighten
something
out
i
got
to
every
time
i
think
about
it
i
ashamed
i
thought
i
was
being
smart
i
thought
i
was
getting
what
i
wanted
maybe
i
grown
up
now
i
got
to
get
it
straightened
out
what
was
it
you
wanted
i
wanted
it
and
i
got
it
but
i
ca
use
it
now
i
wanted
her
too
and
had
her
but
she
no
good
to
me
now
i
not
following
this
so
good
timmy
he
told
me
the
story
then
he
had
been
in
business
with
his
brother
george
warden
george
was
older
by
six
years
george
took
him
in
as
a
partner
george
had
a
flair
for
salesmanship
and
promotion
timmy
was
good
on
the
books
as
he
had
a
natural
knack
for
figure
work
they
had
a
building
supply
business
a
retail
hardware
outlet
a
lumberyard
and
several
concrete
trucks
and
george
had
a
lush
petulant
amoral
discontented
young
wife
named
eloise
i
did
make
any
play
for
her
tal
it
just
seemed
to
happen
she
was
my
brother
wife
and
i
knew
it
was
bad
but
i
could
stop
we
had
to
sneak
around
behind
his
back
hillston
is
a
very
big
city
we
had
to
be
very
careful
i
guess
i
knew
all
the
time
what
she
was
but
george
thought
she
was
the
best
thing
that
ever
walked
she
was
the
one
who
talked
me
into
running
away
with
her
tal
she
was
the
one
who
said
we
have
to
have
money
so
i
started
to
steal
he
told
me
how
he
did
it
a
lot
of
the
gimmicks
did
make
much
sense
to
me
he
did
all
the
ordering
handled
the
bank
accounts
and
deposits
it
was
a
big
and
profitable
operation
he
took
a
little
bit
here
a
little
bit
there
always
in
cash
all
the
time
he
was
doing
it
he
was
carrying
on
the
affair
with
eloise
he
said
it
took
nearly
two
years
to
squirrel
away
almost
sixty
thousand
dollars
the
auditors
did
catch
it
i
could
open
a
bank
account
with
the
money
and
i
knew
better
than
to
put
it
in
a
box
i
put
the
money
in
those
jars
the
kind
with
the
red
rubber
washer
and
the
wire
that
clamps
the
top
on
i
fill
them
and
bury
them
george
kept
worrying
about
why
we
were
making
more
money
i
kept
lying
to
him
eloise
was
getting
more
restless
all
the
time
and
more
careless
i
was
afraid
george
would
find
out
and
i
did
know
what
he
do
she
had
me
sort
of
hypnotized
we
finally
set
the
date
when
we
were
going
to
run
away
everything
was
planned
and
then
they
called
me
up
i
was
reserve
there
was
a
damn
thing
i
could
do
about
it
i
told
eloise
that
when
i
got
out
we
go
through
with
it
the
way
we
planned
but
now
i
stuck
here
and
now
i
do
want
to
go
through
with
it
i
want
to
get
back
there
and
give
the
money
back
to
george
and
tell
him
the
whole
thing
i
had
too
much
chance
to
think
it
over
how
do
you
know
she
has
taken
the
money
and
left
i
did
tell
her
where
i
put
it
it
still
there
nobody
can
find
it
his
story
gave
me
a
lot
to
think
about
timmy
warden
sank
lower
and
lower
by
that
time
those
of
us
who
were
left
alive
had
become
expert
on
how
long
the
dying
would
last
and
i
knew
that
timmy
was
one
of
the
dying
i
knew
he
never
leave
there
alive
i
tried
to
find
out
where
the
money
was
buried
but
i
waited
a
little
too
long
he
was
out
of
his
head
i
listened
to
him
rave
i
listened
to
every
word
he
said
but
in
his
raving
he
never
gave
away
the
hiding
place
it
was
in
a
moment
of
relative
lucidity
that
he
told
me
it
was
afternoon
and
he
caught
my
wrist
with
his
wasted
hand
i
not
going
to
make
it
tal
you
make
it
no
you
go
back
there
and
straighten
it
out
you
can
do
that
tell
george
give
him
the
money
tell
him
everything
sure
where
is
the
money
tell
him
everything
where
the
money
hidden
cindy
would
know
he
said
suddenly
breathless
with
weak
crazy
laughter
cindy
would
know
and
that
all
i
could
get
out
of
him
i
was
still
strong
enough
then
to
use
a
shovel
i
helped
dig
the
hole
for
timmy
warden
that
night
back
in
the
stateside
hospital
i
thought
about
that
sixty
thousand
dollars
i
could
see
those
fruit
jars
with
the
tight
rolls
of
bills
inside
the
glass
i
would
dig
them
out
and
rub
the
dirt
off
and
see
the
green
gleam
of
the
money
it
helped
pass
the
time
in
the
hospital
finally
they
let
me
out
the
thought
of
the
money
was
no
longer
on
the
surface
of
my
mind
it
was
hidden
down
underneath
i
would
think
about
it
but
not
very
often
i
went
back
to
my
job
it
seemed
pretty
tasteless
to
me
i
felt
restless
and
out
of
place
i
used
up
a
lot
of
emotional
energy
in
order
to
stay
alive
and
come
back
to
this
back
to
my
job
and
back
to
charlotte
the
girl
i
had
planned
to
marry
now
that
i
was
back
neither
job
nor
girl
seemed
enough
two
weeks
ago
they
let
me
go
i
do
blame
them
i
been
doing
my
job
in
a
listless
way
i
told
charlotte
i
was
going
away
for
a
while
her
tears
left
me
completely
untouched
she
was
just
a
girl
crying
a
stranger
i
told
her
i
did
know
where
i
was
going
but
i
knew
i
was
going
to
hillston
the
money
was
there
and
somebody
named
cindy
who
would
know
how
to
find
it
i
had
started
the
long
trip
with
an
entirely
unrealistic
anticipation
of
success
now
i
was
not
so
confident
it
seemed
that
i
was
searching
for
more
than
the
sixty
thousand
dollars
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
looking
for
some
meaning
or
significance
to
my
life
i
had
a
thousand
dollars
in
traveler
checks
and
everything
i
owned
with
me
everything
i
owned
filled
two
suitcases
charlotte
had
wept
and
it
had
touched
me
i
had
accepted
being
fired
without
any
special
interest
ever
since
the
repatriation
since
the
hospital
i
had
felt
like
half
a
man
it
was
as
though
the
other
half
of
me
had
been
buried
and
i
was
coming
to
look
for
it
here
in
hillston
a
small
city
i
had
never
seen
somehow
i
had
to
begin
to
live
again
i
had
stopped
living
in
a
prison
camp
and
never
come
completely
to
life
again
i
drank
in
the
motel
room
until
my
lips
felt
numb
there
was
a
pay
phone
in
the
motel
office
the
bird
woman
looked
at
me
with
obvious
disapproval
but
condescended
to
change
three
ones
into
change
for
the
phone
i
had
forgotten
the
time
difference
charlotte
was
having
dinner
with
her
people
her
mother
answered
the
phone
i
heard
the
coldness
in
her
mother
voice
she
called
charlotte
tal
tal
where
are
you
a
place
called
hillston
are
you
all
right
you
sound
so
strange
i
okay
what
are
you
doing
are
you
looking
for
a
job
not
yet
she
lowered
her
voice
so
i
could
barely
hear
her
do
you
want
me
to
come
there
i
would
you
know
if
you
want
me
and
no
no
strings
tal
darling
no
i
just
called
so
you
know
i
all
right
thank
you
for
calling
darling
well
please
write
to
me
i
promised
and
hung
up
and
went
back
to
my
room
i
wanted
things
to
be
the
way
they
had
once
been
between
us
i
did
not
want
to
hurt
her
i
did
not
want
to
hurt
myself
but
i
felt
as
if
a
whole
area
in
my
mind
was
dead
and
numb
the
part
where
she
had
once
been
she
had
been
loyal
while
i
had
been
gone
she
was
the
one
who
had
the
faith
i
would
return
she
did
not
deserve
this
on
the
following
morning
thursday
morning
hillston
lay
clean
and
washed
by
the
night
rains
bright
and
glowing
in
the
april
sunshine
timmy
had
often
talked
about
the
city
it
more
town
than
city
there
is
much
of
a
transient
population
everybody
seems
to
know
everybody
it
a
pretty
good
place
tal
it
lay
amid
gentle
hills
and
the
town
stretched
following
the
line
of
harts
river
i
drove
up
the
main
street
delaware
street
traffic
had
outgrown
the
narrowness
of
the
street
standardization
had
given
most
of
our
small
cities
the
same
look
plastic
and
glass
brick
store
fronts
woolworth
and
penney
and
liggett
and
timely
and
the
chain
grocery
the
essential
character
of
hillston
had
been
watered
down
by
this
standardization
and
yet
there
was
more
individuality
left
than
in
many
other
cities
here
was
a
flavor
of
leisure
of
mild
manners
and
quiet
pleasures
no
major
highway
touched
the
city
it
was
in
an
eddy
apart
from
the
great
current
doubtless
there
were
many
who
complained
acidly
about
the
town
being
dead
on
its
feet
about
the
young
people
leaving
for
greater
opportunities
but
such
human
irritants
did
not
change
the
rather
smug
complacency
of
the
city
the
population
was
thousand
and
timmy
had
told
me
that
it
had
not
changed
very
much
in
the
past
twenty
years
there
was
the
pipe
mill
and
a
small
electronics
industry
and
a
plant
that
made
cheap
hand
tools
but
the
money
in
town
was
the
result
of
its
being
a
shopping
center
for
all
the
surrounding
farmland
i
had
crossed
the
country
as
fast
as
i
could
taking
it
out
on
the
car
anxious
to
get
to
this
place
the
car
kept
stalling
as
i
stopped
for
the
lights
on
delaware
street
when
i
spotted
a
repair
garage
i
turned
in
a
man
came
up
to
me
as
i
got
out
of
the
car
i
think
i
need
a
it
keeps
stalling
and
a
grease
job
and
oil
change
he
looked
at
the
wall
clock
about
three
this
afternoon
be
okay
that
be
all
right
california
plates
on
your
way
through
just
on
a
vacation
i
stopped
here
because
i
used
to
know
a
fellow
from
this
town
timmy
warden
he
was
a
gaunt
man
with
prematurely
white
hair
and
bad
teeth
he
picked
a
cigarette
out
of
the
top
pocket
of
his
coveralls
knew
timmy
did
you
the
way
you
say
it
i
guess
you
know
he
dead
yes
i
was
with
him
when
he
died
there
in
the
camp
eh
guess
it
was
pretty
rough
it
was
rough
he
used
to
talk
about
this
place
and
about
his
brother
george
i
thought
i
stop
and
maybe
see
his
brother
and
tell
him
about
how
it
was
with
timmy
the
man
spat
on
the
garage
floor
i
guess
george
knows
how
it
was
i
do
understand
there
another
man
came
here
from
that
camp
matter
of
fact
still
here
came
here
a
year
ago
name
of
fitzmartin
earl
fitzmartin
he
works
for
george
at
the
lumberyard
guess
you
know
him
you
i
know
him
i
said
everybody
who
survived
the
camp
we
were
in
would
know
fitzmartin
been
taken
later
had
come
in
a
month
after
we
did
he
was
a
lean
man
with
tremendously
powerful
hands
and
arms
he
had
pale
colorless
hair
eyes
the
elusive
shade
of
wood
smoke
he
was
a
texan
and
a
marine
i
knew
him
one
cold
night
six
of
us
had
solemnly
pledged
that
if
we
were
ever
liberated
we
would
one
day
hunt
down
fitzmartin
and
kill
him
we
had
believed
then
that
we
would
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
it
all
came
back
fitz
was
not
a
progressive
yet
he
was
a
disrupting
influence
in
the
camp
we
felt
that
if
we
could
maintain
a
united
front
it
would
improve
our
chances
for
survival
we
organized
ourselves
appointed
committees
assigned
responsibilities
there
were
two
retreads
who
had
been
in
jap
camps
in
another
war
who
knew
the
best
organizational
procedures
fitz
huskier
and
quicker
and
craftier
than
anyone
else
in
camp
refused
to
take
any
part
in
it
he
was
a
loner
he
had
an
animal
instinct
for
survival
he
kept
himself
clean
and
fit
he
ate
anything
that
was
organically
sound
he
prowled
by
himself
and
treated
us
with
icy
contempt
and
amusement
he
was
no
closer
to
us
than
to
his
captors
he
was
one
of
the
twelve
quartered
in
the
same
hut
with
timmy
and
me
perhaps
that
does
not
seem
to
constitute
enough
cause
to
swear
to
kill
a
man
it
would
in
a
normal
situation
but
in
captivity
minor
resentments
become
of
major
importance
fitz
was
with
us
so
he
was
against
us
we
needed
him
and
every
day
he
proved
he
did
need
us
at
the
time
of
the
exchange
fitzmartin
was
perhaps
twenty
pounds
lighter
but
he
was
in
good
shape
many
had
died
but
fitz
was
in
fine
shape
i
knew
him
i
like
to
see
him
i
told
the
garage
man
is
the
lumberyard
far
from
here
it
was
north
of
town
i
had
to
take
a
bus
that
crossed
a
bridge
at
the
north
end
of
town
and
walk
a
half
mile
on
the
shoulder
of
the
highway
past
junk
yards
a
cheap
movie
rundown
rental
cabins
i
kept
asking
myself
why
fitz
should
have
come
to
hillston
he
could
know
about
the
money
but
i
could
remember
the
slyness
of
the
man
his
knack
of
moving
without
a
sound
the
lumberyard
was
large
there
was
an
office
near
the
road
there
was
a
long
shed
open
on
the
front
where
pieces
were
kept
in
bins
in
covered
storage
i
heard
the
whine
of
a
saw
beyond
the
two
buildings
were
tall
stacks
of
lumber
a
truck
was
being
loaded
back
there
in
the
open
shed
a
clerk
was
helping
a
customer
select
window
frames
an
office
girl
with
thin
face
and
dark
hair
looked
up
from
an
adding
machine
and
told
me
i
could
find
fitzmartin
out
in
the
back
where
they
were
loading
the
truck
i
went
back
and
saw
him
before
he
saw
me
he
was
heavier
but
otherwise
unchanged
he
stood
with
another
man
watching
two
men
loading
a
stake
truck
he
wore
khakis
and
stood
with
his
fists
in
his
hip
pockets
the
man
said
something
and
earl
fitzmartin
laughed
the
sound
startled
me
i
had
never
heard
him
laugh
in
the
camp
he
turned
as
i
approached
him
his
face
changed
the
smoke
eyes
looked
at
me
wary
speculative
i
got
the
name
right
have
i
tal
howard
that
right
there
was
of
course
no
move
toward
shaking
hands
he
turned
to
the
other
man
joe
you
go
right
ahead
here
leave
this
slip
in
the
office
on
your
way
out
fitzmartin
started
walking
back
through
the
lot
between
the
stacked
lumber
i
hesitated
and
followed
him
he
led
the
way
to
a
shed
on
the
back
corner
of
the
lot
an
elderly
ford
coupé
was
parked
by
the
shed
he
opened
the
door
and
gestured
and
i
went
into
the
shed
it
was
spotlessly
clean
there
was
a
bunk
table
chair
shelf
with
hot
plate
and
dishes
he
had
a
supply
of
canned
goods
clean
clothes
hanging
on
hooks
a
pile
of
magazines
and
books
near
the
head
of
the
bunk
there
was
a
large
space
heater
in
the
corner
and
through
an
open
door
i
could
see
into
a
small
bathroom
with
unfinished
walls
there
was
no
invitation
to
sit
down
we
faced
each
other
nice
to
see
any
old
pal
from
north
of
the
river
he
said
i
heard
in
town
you
work
here
you
just
happened
to
be
in
town
and
heard
i
work
here
that
right
maybe
you
going
around
looking
all
the
boys
up
maybe
writing
a
book
it
an
idea
my
experiences
as
a
prisoner
of
war
me
and
dean
i
put
you
in
the
book
fitz
the
big
ego
too
damn
impressed
with
himself
to
try
to
help
anybody
else
help
those
gutless
wonders
you
types
stone
me
you
wanted
to
turn
it
into
a
boys
club
i
watched
a
lot
of
you
die
because
you
did
have
the
guts
or
will
or
imagination
to
survive
with
your
help
maybe
a
couple
more
would
have
come
back
you
sound
like
you
think
that
would
be
a
good
thing
there
was
an
amused
sneer
in
his
tone
that
brought
it
all
vividly
back
that
was
what
we
had
sensed
about
him
he
had
cared
if
we
had
all
been
buried
there
just
so
fitzmartin
got
out
of
it
with
a
whole
skin
i
had
thought
my
anger
and
outrage
had
been
buried
had
thought
i
was
beyond
caring
perhaps
he
too
misjudged
the
extent
of
the
contempt
that
made
me
careless
of
his
physical
power
i
struck
blindly
taking
him
almost
completely
by
surprise
my
right
fist
hitting
his
jaw
solidly
the
impact
jarred
my
arm
and
shoulder
and
back
it
knocked
him
back
a
full
step
i
wanted
him
on
the
floor
i
swung
again
and
hit
a
thick
hard
arm
he
muffled
the
third
blow
and
caught
my
left
wrist
then
grabbed
my
right
wrist
i
tried
to
snap
my
wrists
free
but
he
was
far
too
powerful
i
was
able
to
resist
the
grinding
twisting
force
for
several
seconds
his
face
was
quite
impassive
i
was
slowly
forced
down
onto
my
knees
tears
of
anger
and
humiliation
stinging
my
eyes
he
released
my
wrists
suddenly
and
gave
me
a
casual
slap
across
the
side
of
my
head
that
knocked
me
down
onto
the
bare
floor
i
scrambled
to
the
chair
and
tried
to
pick
it
up
to
use
it
as
a
weapon
he
twisted
it
out
of
my
hands
put
a
foot
against
my
chest
and
shoved
me
back
so
that
i
rolled
toward
the
door
he
put
the
chair
back
in
place
went
over
and
sat
on
the
bunk
and
lighted
a
cigarette
i
got
up
slowly
he
looked
at
me
calmly
out
of
your
system
god
damn
you
he
looked
bored
shut
up
sit
down
do
try
to
be
the
boy
hero
howard
i
mark
you
up
some
if
that
what
you
want
i
sat
in
the
chair
my
knees
were
weak
and
my
wrists
hurt
he
got
up
quickly
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
and
looked
out
closed
it
and
went
back
to
the
bunk
we
talk
about
timmy
warden
howard
what
about
timmy
it
too
damn
late
for
games
information
keeps
you
alive
i
did
a
lot
of
listening
in
that
camp
i
made
a
business
of
it
i
know
that
timmy
stole
sixty
thousand
bucks
from
his
brother
and
stashed
it
away
in
jars
i
know
timmy
told
you
that
i
heard
him
tell
you
so
waste
our
time
trying
to
play
dumb
about
it
i
here
and
you
here
and
that
the
only
way
it
adds
up
i
got
here
first
i
got
here
while
you
were
still
in
the
hospital
i
have
got
the
money
if
i
had
it
i
would
still
be
here
that
obvious
i
figured
timmy
might
have
told
you
where
he
hid
it
i
been
waiting
for
you
what
kept
you
i
do
know
any
more
about
it
than
you
do
i
know
he
hid
it
but
i
do
know
where
he
was
silent
as
he
thought
it
over
maybe
i
wo
buy
that
i
came
here
on
a
long
shot
i
did
have
much
to
go
on
i
wanted
to
be
here
and
all
set
when
you
came
after
it
it
was
a
long
shot
but
one
town
is
the
same
as
another
to
me
i
ca
see
you
coming
here
to
find
the
money
and
not
knowing
any
more
than
i
do
you
a
more
conservative
type
howard
you
know
something
i
want
to
know
that
right
i
said
i
know
exactly
where
it
is
i
can
go
and
dig
it
up
right
now
that
why
i
waited
a
year
before
i
came
here
and
that
why
i
came
here
to
see
you
instead
of
going
and
digging
it
up
why
come
at
all
i
shrugged
i
lost
my
job
i
remembered
the
money
i
thought
i
come
here
and
look
around
i
spent
a
year
looking
around
i
know
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
about
timmy
warden
the
way
he
lived
the
way
his
mind
worked
than
ever
know
and
i
ca
find
it
then
i
wo
be
able
to
either
will
i
then
you
better
take
off
howard
go
back
where
you
came
from
i
think
i
stay
around
he
leaned
forward
then
you
do
have
some
little
clue
that
i
have
maybe
it
is
a
very
good
one
i
do
know
any
more
than
you
do
i
just
have
more
confidence
in
myself
than
i
have
in
you
that
made
him
laugh
the
laughter
stung
my
pride
it
was
a
ludicrous
thought
to
him
that
i
could
do
anything
in
the
world
he
could
do
you
wasted
better
than
a
year
on
it
at
least
i
have
done
that
i
said
hotly
he
shrugged
i
have
to
be
somewhere
it
might
as
well
be
here
wasted
about
it
i
got
a
good
job
let
pool
everything
we
know
and
can
remember
and
if
we
can
locate
it
i
give
you
a
third
no
i
said
too
quickly
he
sat
very
still
and
watched
me
you
have
something
to
work
on
no
i
do
you
can
end
up
with
nothing
instead
of
a
third
or
all
of
it
instead
of
a
third
finding
it
and
taking
it
away
from
here
are
two
different
problems
i
take
that
chance
he
shrugged
well
suit
yourself
go
and
say
hello
to
george
give
him
my
regards
and
eloise
you
wo
be
able
to
do
that
she
took
off
while
we
were
still
behind
the
wire
took
off
with
a
salesman
they
say
maybe
she
took
the
money
with
her
i
do
think
so
but
she
knew
timmy
was
hiding
it
had
hidden
a
big
amount
from
what
he
said
about
her
she
would
leave
without
it
she
did
he
said
smiling
take
my
word
she
left
without
it
two
the
lumberyard
had
looked
reasonably
prosperous
the
retail
hardware
store
was
not
what
i
expected
from
talks
with
timmy
i
had
expected
a
big
place
with
five
or
six
clerks
and
a
stock
that
ranged
from
appliances
and
cocktail
trays
to
pumps
and
pipe
wrenches
it
was
a
narrow
dingy
store
poorly
lighted
there
was
an
air
of
dust
and
defeat
about
it
it
was
on
a
side
street
off
the
less
prosperous
looking
end
of
delaware
street
a
clerk
in
a
soiled
shirt
came
to
help
me
i
said
i
wanted
to
see
mr
warden
the
clerk
pointed
back
toward
a
small
office
in
the
rear
where
through
glass
i
could
see
a
man
hunched
over
a
desk
he
looked
up
as
i
walked
back
to
the
office
the
door
was
open
i
could
see
the
resemblance
to
timmy
but
timmy
just
before
and
for
a
short
time
after
we
were
taken
had
a
look
of
bouncing
vitality
good
spirits
this
man
looked
far
older
than
the
six
years
difference
timmy
had
told
me
about
he
was
a
big
man
as
timmy
had
been
the
wide
high
forehead
was
the
same
and
the
slightly
beaked
nose
and
the
strong
square
jaw
but
george
warden
looked
as
though
he
had
been
sick
for
a
long
time
his
color
was
bad
the
stubble
on
the
unshaven
jaw
was
gray
his
eyes
were
vague
and
troubled
and
there
was
a
raw
smell
of
whisky
in
the
small
office
something
i
can
do
for
you
my
name
is
tal
howard
mr
warden
i
was
a
friend
of
timmy
you
were
a
friend
of
timmy
he
repeated
it
in
an
odd
way
apathetic
and
yet
somehow
cynical
i
was
with
him
when
he
died
so
was
fitz
sit
down
howard
drink
i
said
i
would
have
a
drink
he
pushed
by
my
chair
and
went
out
to
a
sink
i
heard
him
rinsing
out
a
glass
he
came
back
and
picked
a
bottle
off
the
floor
in
the
corner
and
put
a
generous
drink
in
each
glass
here
to
timmy
he
said
to
timmy
fitz
got
out
of
it
you
got
out
of
it
but
timmy
did
make
it
i
almost
did
make
it
what
did
he
actually
die
of
fitz
could
say
i
shrugged
it
hard
to
tell
we
did
have
medical
care
he
lost
a
lot
of
weight
and
his
resistance
was
down
he
had
a
bad
cold
he
ran
a
fever
and
his
legs
got
swollen
he
began
to
have
trouble
breathing
it
hurt
him
to
breathe
a
lot
of
them
went
like
that
nothing
specific
just
a
lot
of
things
there
was
much
you
could
do
he
turned
the
dirty
glass
around
and
around
he
should
have
come
back
he
would
have
known
what
to
do
about
what
i
guess
he
told
you
about
how
we
were
doing
before
he
left
he
said
you
had
a
pretty
good
business
this
store
used
to
be
over
on
delaware
we
moved
about
six
months
ago
sold
the
lease
sold
my
house
too
still
got
the
yard
and
this
the
rest
of
it
is
gone
i
felt
uncomfortable
business
is
bad
i
guess
it
pretty
good
for
some
people
what
business
are
you
in
i
not
working
right
now
he
smiled
at
me
in
a
mirthless
way
and
i
suppose
you
plan
on
sticking
around
awhile
i
thought
of
it
did
fitz
send
for
you
i
do
know
what
you
mean
i
did
know
he
was
here
but
you
talked
to
him
he
phoned
me
and
said
you
probably
be
in
for
a
little
chat
and
that
you
an
old
friend
of
timmy
he
been
working
for
me
for
nearly
a
year
i
do
see
how
i
can
give
you
a
job
there
just
is
enough
coming
in
i
could
swing
it
i
do
want
a
job
mr
warden
he
kept
smiling
his
eyes
were
funny
i
had
the
feeling
that
he
was
either
very
drunk
or
out
of
his
head
maybe
something
nice
out
of
the
store
we
still
have
some
nice
things
i
could
unlock
the
gun
rack
for
you
need
a
nice
over
and
under
with
gold
inlay
french
walnut
stock
on
the
house
no
thanks
i
do
understand
mr
warden
i
knew
timmy
and
i
thought
maybe
it
would
be
the
right
thing
to
do
to
just
stop
in
and
chat
sure
but
you
went
out
to
the
yard
first
yes
i
went
out
there
because
i
put
my
car
in
a
garage
here
and
i
told
the
man
i
known
timmy
in
prison
camp
he
said
there
was
another
man
here
who
been
in
the
same
place
earl
fitzmartin
so
i
went
out
there
and
saw
him
then
i
came
here
i
could
have
come
here
first
and
then
gone
out
there
i
do
know
why
you
think
you
have
to
give
me
a
job
or
a
gun
or
anything
he
looked
at
me
and
then
bent
over
and
picked
up
the
bottle
again
he
put
some
in
both
glasses
okay
he
said
so
it
just
like
that
pay
no
attention
to
me
hardly
anybody
does
any
more
except
fitz
he
a
good
worker
the
yard
makes
a
little
money
that
a
good
thing
it
yes
i
guess
it
is
it
was
anything
like
the
conversation
i
had
expected
he
was
a
strange
man
he
seemed
defeated
and
yet
amused
as
though
amused
at
his
own
defeat
timmy
talked
a
lot
about
hillston
i
said
i
guess
he
did
he
lived
here
most
of
his
life
though
i
did
feel
right
about
it
i
took
the
plunge
we
had
a
lot
of
time
to
talk
they
made
us
go
to
lectures
and
read
propaganda
and
write
reports
on
what
we
read
but
the
rest
of
the
time
we
talked
i
feel
as
though
i
know
hillston
pretty
well
even
know
the
girls
he
used
to
go
with
ruth
stamm
janice
currier
cindy
somebody
sure
he
said
softly
half
smiling
ruthie
stamm
and
it
was
judith
not
janice
currier
those
were
two
of
them
nice
girls
but
the
last
couple
of
years
before
he
went
away
he
stopped
running
around
so
much
stuck
closer
to
the
business
lots
of
nights
he
work
on
the
books
he
was
getting
almost
too
serious
to
suit
me
was
there
one
named
cindy
he
frowned
and
thought
and
shook
his
head
no
cindy
i
know
of
either
of
those
other
two
would
have
made
him
a
good
wife
ruthie
is
still
around
town
still
single
judy
got
married
and
moved
away
el
paso
i
think
either
one
of
them
would
have
made
him
a
better
wife
than
the
one
i
got
stuck
with
eloise
he
talk
about
her
he
mentioned
her
a
few
times
she
gone
i
know
fitz
told
me
lovely
little
eloise
bitch
while
you
around
stop
in
again
any
time
we
have
a
nice
little
chat
i
usually
here
hell
i
used
to
have
a
lot
of
other
things
to
do
zoning
board
chamber
of
commerce
rotary
always
on
the
run
always
busy
now
i
have
a
lot
of
time
all
the
time
in
the
world
i
was
dismissed
i
walked
back
through
the
narrow
store
to
the
street
door
the
clerk
leaned
against
one
of
the
counters
near
the
front
picking
his
teeth
with
a
match
it
felt
good
to
get
back
out
into
the
sunlight
the
cheap
liquor
had
left
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
it
was
too
early
to
go
after
the
car
i
went
into
the
nearest
bar
i
could
find
and
ordered
an
ale
it
was
a
dark
place
full
of
brown
and
violet
shadows
with
deer
antlers
on
the
wall
and
some
dusty
mounted
fish
two
elderly
men
played
checkers
at
a
corner
table
the
bartender
was
a
dwarf
the
floor
was
built
up
behind
the
bar
to
bring
him
up
to
the
right
height
i
sipped
the
ale
and
thought
about
fitz
about
my
own
unexpectedly
violent
reaction
that
had
been
made
ludicrous
by
his
superior
strength
i
had
not
thought
that
i
cared
enough
it
was
a
long
time
since
camp
but
he
had
brought
it
all
back
the
time
with
him
had
not
been
pure
fiasco
however
i
sensed
that
i
had
won
a
very
small
victory
in
the
talk
that
had
followed
the
fight
he
was
not
certain
of
where
i
stood
how
much
i
knew
the
talk
with
george
had
canceled
that
small
victory
george
puzzled
me
there
was
a
curious
in
his
relationship
with
fitz
something
i
could
not
understand
bartenders
are
good
sources
of
information
i
sensed
that
the
little
man
was
watching
me
trying
to
figure
out
who
i
was
i
signaled
for
a
refill
when
he
brought
my
glass
back
from
the
beer
tap
i
said
what
do
people
do
for
excitement
around
this
town
he
had
a
high
thin
voice
stranger
in
town
are
you
it
pretty
quiet
saturday
night
there
things
going
on
here
and
there
not
much
on
a
weekday
there
some
that
drive
all
the
way
to
redding
gambling
there
but
it
crooked
then
it
easier
to
meet
women
there
than
here
you
a
salesman
i
needed
a
quick
answer
and
i
suddenly
remembered
something
that
fitz
had
said
to
give
me
my
gimmick
and
reasonably
plausible
i
working
on
a
book
he
showed
a
quick
interest
writer
are
you
what
there
here
to
write
about
historical
stuff
no
it
a
different
kind
of
a
book
i
was
taken
prisoner
in
korea
some
of
the
boys
died
there
boys
i
knew
this
book
is
a
sort
of
personal
history
of
those
boys
you
know
the
way
they
lived
what
they
did
what
they
would
have
come
back
to
if
they
lived
one
of
them
is
from
this
town
timmy
warden
hell
did
you
know
timmy
my
god
that
was
a
shame
there
was
a
good
kid
i
been
talking
to
his
brother
george
just
down
the
street
the
little
man
clucked
and
shook
his
head
george
has
just
plain
gone
to
hell
the
last
year
or
so
he
and
timmy
had
a
pretty
good
setup
too
couple
of
good
businesses
but
then
george
wife
left
him
then
he
got
word
timmy
was
dead
it
took
the
heart
out
of
him
i
guess
he
got
about
one
tenth
the
business
he
used
to
have
and
he
have
that
long
if
he
keeps
hitting
the
bottle
buck
stamm
girl
has
been
trying
to
straighten
him
out
but
she
wasting
her
time
but
that
ruthie
is
stubborn
i
tell
you
if
timmy
had
made
it
back
and
if
he
waited
until
now
he
have
a
long
uphill
fight
george
has
been
selling
stuff
off
and
piddling
away
the
money
he
gets
lives
in
a
room
at
white
hotel
gets
drunk
enough
to
be
picked
up
every
now
and
then
for
a
while
there
they
just
take
him
home
because
he
used
to
be
an
important
man
in
this
town
now
they
let
him
sober
up
in
the
can
one
of
the
old
men
playing
checkers
said
stump
you
talk
too
damn
much
watch
your
game
stump
said
get
some
kings
let
smart
people
talk
in
peace
willy
he
turned
back
to
me
and
said
how
do
you
figure
on
writing
up
timmy
oh
just
the
way
he
lived
where
he
was
born
interview
his
schoolteachers
talk
to
the
girls
he
dated
stump
glanced
at
the
checker
players
and
then
hunched
himself
over
the
bar
and
spoke
in
a
tone
so
low
they
could
hear
him
stump
wore
a
sly
smirk
as
he
talked
now
i
would
stand
back
of
this
and
it
anything
you
could
put
in
your
book
but
i
heard
it
from
a
pretty
good
source
that
before
timmy
took
off
into
the
army
he
and
that
eloise
warden
were
a
little
better
than
just
plain
friends
know
what
i
mean
she
was
a
piece
and
you
can
hardly
blame
the
kid
if
she
was
right
there
asking
for
it
she
was
no
good
anyway
she
took
off
with
a
salesman
and
nobody
seen
or
heard
from
her
since
he
backed
away
and
gave
me
a
conspiratorial
smile
of
course
george
would
know
anything
about
it
like
they
say
he
be
the
last
to
know
are
there
any
other
relatives
in
town
beside
george
not
a
one
their
daddy
died
six
or
seven
years
ago
george
got
married
right
after
that
then
the
three
of
them
george
timmy
and
eloise
stayed
right
on
in
the
old
warden
place
george
sold
that
this
year
man
named
syler
bought
it
he
chopped
it
up
into
apartments
i
hear
i
talked
with
him
for
another
half
hour
but
he
did
have
very
much
to
add
he
asked
me
to
stop
around
again
i
liked
the
atmosphere
of
his
bar
but
i
did
like
him
he
was
a
little
too
eager
to
prove
he
knew
everything
particularly
the
unsavory
details
when
i
got
back
to
the
garage
a
little
after
three
my
car
was
ready
i
paid
for
the
work
it
ran
smoothly
on
the
way
back
to
the
motel
south
of
town
once
i
was
in
my
room
with
the
door
shut
i
reviewed
everything
that
had
happened
though
i
had
told
my
lie
about
writing
up
timmy
on
impulse
i
could
see
how
it
could
hurt
anything
in
fact
it
might
make
things
a
good
deal
easier
i
decided
that
i
better
buy
some
kind
of
pocket
notebook
and
write
things
down
so
that
my
story
would
stand
up
a
little
better
there
was
no
reason
why
timmy
and
the
others
like
him
should
be
written
up
i
remembered
that
a
magazine
had
done
the
same
sort
of
thing
with
the
progressives
who
refused
repatriation
so
why
not
the
dead
they
would
be
more
interesting
than
the
turncoats
who
almost
without
exception
fell
into
two
groups
they
were
either
ignorant
and
very
nearly
or
they
were
neurotic
with
a
lifelong
feeling
of
having
been
rejected
the
dead
were
more
interesting
my
one
abortive
attempt
to
find
cindy
had
failed
using
the
cover
story
of
writing
up
timmy
i
should
be
able
to
find
her
from
what
timmy
had
said
she
was
a
girl
who
would
know
of
a
special
hiding
place
and
the
money
was
there
unless
eloise
had
taken
it
i
was
puzzled
by
fitz
insistence
that
she
had
taken
it
when
i
went
back
into
town
for
dinner
i
bought
a
notebook
in
a
drugstore
at
dinner
i
filled
three
pages
with
notes
i
could
have
filled
more
timmy
had
talked
a
lot
there
had
been
much
else
to
do
i
went
to
a
movie
but
i
could
keep
my
mind
on
it
the
next
person
to
talk
to
was
ruth
stamm
i
could
see
her
the
next
morning
but
back
in
the
motel
room
i
took
another
look
at
ruth
stamm
i
took
her
picture
out
of
the
back
of
my
wallet
tomorrow
friday
i
would
see
her
for
the
first
time
in
the
flesh
i
had
looked
at
this
picture
a
thousand
times
timmy
had
showed
it
to
me
in
camp
i
remembered
the
day
we
sat
with
our
backs
against
a
wall
in
watery
sunshine
and
he
took
the
picture
out
and
showed
it
to
me
that
the
one
tal
i
did
have
sense
enough
to
stay
with
her
that
the
good
one
tal
ruthie
stamm
they
had
taken
my
papers
away
from
me
including
the
shots
of
charlotte
i
held
the
picture
of
ruthie
stamm
turning
it
toward
the
pale
sunshine
it
was
cracked
but
none
of
the
cracks
touched
her
face
it
was
in
color
and
the
colors
had
faded
and
changed
she
sat
on
her
heels
and
scratched
the
joyous
belly
of
a
blond
cocker
while
she
laughed
up
into
the
camera
eye
she
wore
yellow
shorts
and
a
halter
top
and
her
laughter
was
fresh
and
good
and
shared
in
some
crazy
way
it
became
our
picture
timmy
and
mine
i
took
it
off
his
body
after
he
died
and
it
became
mine
it
represented
an
alien
world
of
sanity
and
kindness
and
strength
i
looked
at
it
often
now
i
took
it
out
again
and
lay
on
the
motel
bed
and
looked
at
it
in
the
lamplight
and
felt
a
tingle
of
anticipation
for
the
first
time
i
permitted
myself
to
wonder
if
this
pilgrimage
to
hillston
was
in
part
due
to
the
picture
of
a
girl
i
had
never
seen
and
to
wonder
if
this
picture
had
something
to
do
with
the
death
of
love
for
charlotte
i
put
the
picture
away
it
took
a
long
time
to
get
to
sleep
but
the
sleep
that
came
was
deep
and
good
three
on
friday
morning
it
was
not
until
i
opened
the
bureau
drawer
to
take
out
a
clean
shirt
that
i
knew
somebody
had
been
in
the
room
i
had
stacked
the
clean
shirts
neatly
in
one
corner
of
the
big
middle
drawer
they
were
scattered
all
over
the
drawer
as
if
stirred
by
a
hasty
hand
i
went
over
all
my
things
and
saw
more
and
more
evidence
of
quick
careless
search
there
was
nothing
for
anyone
to
find
i
had
written
down
nothing
about
the
elusive
cindy
it
did
not
seem
probable
that
the
maid
or
the
woman
who
had
rented
me
the
room
had
done
this
nor
did
it
seem
probable
that
it
had
occurred
on
the
previous
day
while
i
was
out
i
checked
the
door
i
distinctly
remembered
locking
it
it
was
unlocked
that
meant
someone
had
come
in
while
i
had
slept
fortunately
from
long
habit
i
had
put
my
wallet
inside
the
pillowcase
my
money
was
safe
some
cool
morning
air
came
through
the
door
chilling
my
face
and
chest
and
i
realized
i
was
sweating
lightly
i
remembered
how
fitz
could
move
so
quietly
at
night
i
did
not
like
the
thought
of
his
being
in
the
room
being
able
to
unlock
the
door
i
did
not
see
how
it
could
have
been
anyone
else
i
wondered
how
he
had
found
the
motel
so
easily
i
had
given
the
address
to
no
one
yet
it
could
not
have
taken
too
long
on
the
phone
maybe
an
hour
or
an
hour
and
a
half
to
find
where
i
was
registered
it
would
take
patience
but
fitzmartin
had
waited
over
a
year
i
had
breakfast
looked
up
an
address
and
drove
off
to
see
the
girl
of
the
cracked
treasured
picture
the
girl
who
unknown
to
herself
had
eased
great
loneliness
and
strengthened
frail
courage
buck
stamm
was
a
veterinary
his
home
and
place
of
business
was
just
east
of
town
a
pleasant
old
frame
house
with
the
animal
hospital
close
by
dogs
made
a
vast
clamor
when
i
drove
up
they
were
in
individual
runways
beside
the
kennels
there
were
horses
in
a
corral
beyond
the
house
stamm
came
out
into
the
when
the
bell
on
the
door
rang
he
was
an
enormous
man
with
bushy
red
hair
that
was
turning
gray
he
had
a
heavy
baritone
voice
and
an
impressive
frown
we
not
open
around
here
yet
unless
it
an
emergency
young
man
no
emergency
i
wanted
to
see
your
daughter
for
a
minute
what
about
it
a
personal
matter
i
was
a
friend
of
timmy
warden
he
did
not
look
pleased
i
guess
i
ca
stop
you
from
seeing
her
she
at
the
house
wasting
time
over
coffee
go
on
up
there
tell
her
al
has
showed
up
yet
and
i
need
help
with
the
feeding
tell
her
butch
died
in
the
night
and
she
have
to
phone
the
bronsons
got
that
i
can
remember
it
and
do
keep
her
too
long
i
need
help
down
here
go
around
to
the
back
door
she
in
the
kitchen
i
went
across
the
lawn
to
the
house
and
up
the
back
steps
it
was
a
warm
morning
and
the
door
was
open
the
screens
were
on
yet
the
girl
came
to
the
back
door
she
was
medium
tall
her
hair
was
dark
red
a
red
like
you
can
see
in
old
furniture
made
of
cherry
wood
oiled
and
polished
so
the
sun
glints
fire
streaks
in
it
she
wore
dungarees
and
a
pale
blue
blouse
her
eyes
were
tilted
gray
her
mouth
a
bit
heavy
and
quite
wide
she
had
good
golden
skin
tones
instead
of
the
blotched
pasty
white
of
most
redheads
her
figure
was
lovely
she
was
or
perhaps
there
are
many
women
in
the
world
as
attractive
as
ruth
stamm
but
the
expression
they
wear
for
the
world
betrays
them
their
faces
are
arrogant
or
petulant
or
sensuous
that
is
all
right
because
their
desirability
makes
up
for
it
and
you
know
they
will
be
good
for
a
little
time
and
when
you
have
grown
accustomed
to
the
beauty
there
will
be
just
the
arrogance
or
the
petulance
left
but
ruth
wore
her
own
face
for
the
world
wore
an
expression
of
strength
and
humility
and
goodness
should
you
become
accustomed
to
her
loveliness
there
would
still
be
all
that
left
this
was
a
girl
she
could
be
any
other
way
because
all
the
usual
poses
and
artifices
were
left
out
of
her
this
was
a
girl
you
could
hurt
a
girl
who
would
demand
and
deserve
utter
loyalty
i
guess
i
staring
i
said
she
smiled
you
certainly
are
she
tried
to
make
smile
and
words
casual
but
in
those
few
moments
as
it
happens
so
very
rarely
a
sharp
awareness
had
been
born
an
intense
and
personal
curiosity
i
took
the
picture
out
of
my
pocket
and
handed
it
to
her
she
looked
at
it
and
then
looked
sharply
at
me
eyes
narrowed
where
did
you
get
this
timmy
warden
had
it
timmy
i
did
know
he
had
this
were
you
at
that
place
in
the
camp
with
him
yes
wait
a
minute
your
father
gave
me
some
messages
for
you
he
says
al
has
showed
up
and
he
needs
help
with
the
feeding
and
you
to
phone
the
bronsons
that
butch
died
during
the
night
her
face
showed
immediate
concern
that
too
bad
who
was
butch
a
nice
big
red
setter
some
kid
in
a
jalopy
hit
him
and
did
even
stop
i
should
phone
right
away
i
would
like
to
talk
to
you
when
you
have
more
time
could
i
take
you
to
lunch
today
what
do
you
want
to
talk
to
me
about
the
lie
was
useful
again
i
doing
a
book
on
the
ones
who
did
come
back
i
thought
you
might
help
fill
me
in
on
timmy
he
mentioned
you
many
times
we
used
to
go
together
i
yes
i
help
all
i
can
can
you
pick
me
up
at
here
i
be
glad
to
and
may
i
have
the
picture
back
she
hesitated
and
then
handed
it
to
me
the
girl
in
this
picture
was
eighteen
that
a
long
time
ago
she
frowned
you
did
tell
me
your
name
yet
howard
tal
howard
our
glances
met
for
a
few
seconds
again
there
was
that
strong
awareness
and
interest
i
believe
it
startled
her
as
much
as
it
did
me
the
figure
in
the
picture
was
a
girl
this
was
a
woman
a
fulfillment
of
all
the
promises
in
the
picture
a
mature
and
lovely
woman
and
we
were
shyly
awkward
with
each
other
she
said
and
went
into
the
house
i
drove
back
into
town
for
a
long
time
i
had
carried
the
picture
in
the
photograph
in
my
mind
now
reality
was
superimposed
on
that
faded
picture
i
had
imagined
that
i
had
idealized
the
photo
image
given
it
qualities
it
did
not
possess
now
at
last
i
knew
that
the
reality
was
stronger
more
persuasive
than
the
dreaming
i
found
the
old
warden
house
and
chatted
for
a
time
with
the
amiable
syler
who
had
purchased
it
from
george
warden
it
was
a
big
frame
house
and
he
had
cut
it
into
four
apartments
syler
needed
no
encouragement
to
talk
in
fact
it
was
difficult
to
get
away
from
him
he
complained
of
the
condition
of
the
inside
of
the
house
when
he
took
it
over
that
george
warden
lived
here
alone
for
a
while
and
that
man
must
have
lived
like
a
darn
bear
in
addition
he
complained
about
the
yard
when
i
took
it
over
i
expect
much
grass
but
the
whole
darn
place
had
been
spaded
up
like
somebody
was
going
to
plant
every
inch
of
it
and
then
just
left
it
alone
that
was
a
clue
to
some
of
fitzmartin
activities
he
was
a
man
who
would
do
a
good
job
of
searching
and
the
isolation
of
the
house
behind
high
plantings
would
give
him
an
uninterrupted
opportunity
to
dig
i
drove
back
out
through
april
warmth
and
picked
up
ruth
stamm
at
the
time
she
suggested
she
had
changed
to
a
white
sweater
and
a
dark
green
skirt
she
seemed
more
reserved
as
if
she
had
begun
to
doubt
the
wisdom
of
coming
along
with
me
as
we
got
into
the
car
i
said
how
did
the
bronsons
take
it
very
hard
i
thought
they
would
but
i
talked
them
into
getting
another
dog
right
away
that
the
best
way
not
the
same
breed
but
a
new
pup
young
enough
to
need
and
demand
attention
where
should
we
have
lunch
where
we
can
talk
the
coffee
shop
at
the
hillston
inn
is
nice
i
remembered
seeing
it
i
was
able
to
park
almost
in
front
she
led
the
way
back
through
a
bleak
lobby
and
down
a
half
flight
of
stairs
to
the
coffee
shop
it
had
big
dark
oak
booths
upholstered
in
red
quilted
plastic
they
were
doing
a
good
business
the
girls
were
brisk
starched
there
was
a
good
smell
of
steaks
and
chops
she
accepted
the
offer
of
a
drink
before
lunch
and
said
she
like
an
so
i
ordered
two
of
them
there
was
an
exceptionally
fresh
clean
look
about
her
she
handled
herself
casually
and
well
how
well
did
you
know
timmy
she
asked
me
pretty
well
in
a
deal
like
that
you
get
to
know
people
well
whatever
they
are
it
shows
you
knew
him
well
too
i
guess
we
went
steady
it
started
seven
years
ago
somehow
it
seems
like
longer
than
seven
years
we
were
seniors
in
high
school
when
it
started
he
been
going
with
a
friend
of
mine
judy
currier
they
had
a
sort
of
spat
and
they
were
mad
at
each
other
i
was
mad
at
the
boy
i
been
going
with
when
he
wanted
to
take
me
out
i
went
and
we
went
together
from
then
on
when
we
graduated
we
both
went
up
to
state
college
at
redding
he
only
went
two
years
and
then
came
back
to
help
george
when
he
quit
i
quit
too
we
came
back
here
and
everybody
thought
we
were
going
to
get
married
she
smiled
a
small
wry
smile
i
guess
i
did
too
but
then
things
changed
i
guess
he
lost
interest
he
worked
very
hard
we
drifted
apart
were
you
in
love
with
him
she
gave
me
a
slightly
startled
glance
i
thought
i
was
of
course
otherwise
we
would
have
been
as
close
but
i
do
know
as
i
can
explain
it
you
see
timmy
was
very
popular
in
high
school
he
was
a
good
athlete
and
everybody
liked
him
he
was
president
of
the
senior
class
i
was
popular
too
i
was
queen
of
the
senior
pageant
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
we
both
liked
to
dance
and
we
were
good
at
it
it
was
as
if
people
us
to
go
together
it
seemed
right
to
other
people
and
that
sort
of
infected
us
i
guess
maybe
we
fell
in
love
with
the
way
we
looked
together
and
felt
the
responsibility
of
what
other
people
wanted
us
to
be
we
made
a
good
team
do
you
understand
that
of
course
when
it
finally
ended
it
did
hurt
as
badly
as
i
would
have
thought
it
would
if
it
had
ended
we
would
have
gone
on
and
gotten
married
and
i
guess
it
would
have
been
all
right
she
looked
puzzled
what
kind
of
a
guy
was
he
ruth
i
told
you
popular
and
nice
and
underneath
i
do
want
to
feel
disloyal
or
anything
another
drink
no
we
better
order
thanks
after
we
had
given
the
order
she
frowned
beyond
me
and
said
there
was
something
weak
about
timmy
things
had
come
too
easily
his
mind
was
good
and
his
body
was
good
and
he
made
friends
without
trying
he
never
been
tested
i
had
the
feeling
that
he
thought
that
things
would
always
be
that
easy
all
his
life
that
he
could
always
get
whatever
he
wanted
it
worried
me
because
i
learned
the
world
is
like
that
it
was
as
though
nothing
had
ever
happened
to
him
to
make
him
grow
up
and
i
used
to
wonder
what
would
happen
when
things
started
to
go
wrong
i
knew
he
either
turn
into
a
man
or
he
start
to
whine
and
complain
he
turned
into
a
man
ruth
there
was
a
sudden
look
of
tears
in
her
eyes
i
glad
to
hear
that
i
very
glad
to
hear
that
i
wish
he
come
back
i
think
you
would
have
seen
that
i
right
after
he
stopped
going
with
you
who
did
he
go
with
before
he
went
into
the
army
her
eyes
were
evasive
no
one
i
lowered
my
voice
he
told
me
about
eloise
her
face
became
more
pale
so
it
was
true
then
i
could
be
completely
certain
but
i
suspected
it
it
made
me
sick
to
think
that
could
be
going
on
and
it
was
part
of
the
pattern
everything
came
so
easily
i
do
think
he
even
realized
what
he
was
doing
to
himself
and
to
george
she
was
trash
everybody
was
sorry
and
shocked
when
george
married
her
timmy
told
me
about
eloise
and
he
told
me
he
was
sorry
about
it
he
wanted
to
come
back
so
he
could
make
things
right
i
guess
he
knew
he
could
turn
the
clock
back
and
make
things
like
they
were
before
but
he
wanted
to
be
able
to
make
amends
of
some
sort
i
do
think
george
has
ever
suspected
but
even
if
he
knew
now
it
could
hurt
too
much
he
knows
what
she
is
now
what
was
she
like
quite
pretty
in
a
sort
of
way
a
tawny
blonde
with
a
kind
of
face
i
do
know
where
she
got
those
features
they
not
like
the
other
people
in
her
family
she
was
a
year
ahead
of
me
in
school
at
first
and
then
in
the
same
year
and
then
a
year
behind
me
she
never
did
graduate
from
high
school
she
was
dumb
as
a
post
as
far
as
schoolwork
is
concerned
but
smart
in
other
ways
very
smart
she
was
sloppy
you
know
soiled
collars
bare
dirty
ankles
she
always
soaked
herself
in
perfume
she
had
a
very
sexy
walk
full
hips
and
a
tiny
waist
and
nice
legs
she
had
a
lot
of
little
provocative
mannerisms
boys
used
to
follow
her
around
like
stupid
dogs
their
eyes
glazed
and
their
tongues
out
we
used
to
make
fun
of
her
but
we
hated
her
and
in
some
funny
way
we
were
jealous
of
her
she
did
as
she
pleased
she
always
seemed
to
be
mocking
everybody
it
was
a
very
good
marriage
for
her
to
marry
george
then
the
three
of
them
were
living
in
that
house
i
guess
she
got
bored
being
right
there
in
the
house
once
she
got
bored
timmy
had
as
much
chance
as
hamburger
in
a
panther
cage
i
guess
they
were
careful
but
in
a
place
this
size
people
get
to
know
things
quite
a
few
people
were
talking
by
the
time
timmy
went
away
i
had
had
a
date
with
timmy
for
over
two
years
when
he
went
away
then
eloise
went
off
with
a
salesman
that
was
so
stupid
of
her
she
had
everything
she
wanted
george
believed
in
her
the
man
name
was
fulton
he
was
a
big
man
who
drove
a
gray
studebaker
and
came
to
hillston
about
once
every
six
months
eloise
ran
off
almost
no
it
over
two
years
ago
george
had
to
be
out
of
town
on
business
people
saw
eloise
and
fulton
right
here
in
this
place
having
dinner
one
night
bold
as
can
be
they
must
have
left
that
night
when
george
came
back
they
were
gone
did
he
try
to
trace
her
he
did
want
to
he
was
too
badly
hurt
she
packed
her
prettiest
things
and
taken
the
house
money
and
gone
without
even
leaving
a
note
i
bet
that
some
day
she
going
to
come
crawling
back
here
would
george
take
her
back
i
do
know
i
do
know
what
he
do
i
been
trying
to
help
george
she
blushed
dad
always
teases
me
about
the
way
i
keep
bringing
kittens
and
homeless
dogs
back
to
the
place
he
says
my
wards
eat
up
all
the
profits
it
sort
of
the
same
with
george
he
got
anyone
now
not
a
soul
not
anyone
in
the
world
he
drinking
all
the
time
and
he
lost
most
of
his
business
i
do
what
little
i
can
cook
for
him
sometimes
get
his
room
cleaned
up
get
his
clothes
in
shape
but
i
ca
seem
to
make
him
wake
up
he
just
keeps
going
down
and
down
it
makes
me
sick
i
saw
him
at
the
store
he
was
in
very
good
shape
he
acted
strange
the
store
is
doing
almost
no
business
at
all
the
lumberyard
looks
all
right
i
was
out
there
to
talk
to
fitzmartin
he
was
in
the
same
camp
i
know
he
told
me
that
i
is
he
a
good
friend
of
yours
no
i
do
like
him
tal
he
a
strange
man
i
do
know
why
george
hired
him
it
almost
as
if
he
had
some
hold
over
george
and
i
have
the
feeling
he
keeps
pushing
george
downhill
i
do
know
how
or
why
he
should
he
kept
bothering
me
he
kept
coming
to
see
me
to
talk
about
timmy
it
seemed
very
strange
what
did
he
want
to
talk
about
it
did
make
much
sense
he
wanted
to
know
where
timmy
and
i
used
to
go
on
picnics
when
we
were
in
high
school
he
wanted
to
know
if
we
ever
went
on
hikes
together
and
he
acted
so
sly
about
it
so
sort
of
insinuating
that
the
last
time
he
came
it
made
me
mad
and
i
told
him
i
would
talk
to
him
any
more
it
seemed
like
such
a
queer
thing
for
him
to
keep
doing
he
creepy
you
know
his
eyes
are
so
strange
and
colorless
has
he
stayed
away
oh
yes
i
got
very
positive
about
it
he
had
such
an
unhealthy
kind
of
interest
in
timmy
i
wondered
if
it
was
the
same
sort
of
thing
with
you
but
if
you
going
to
write
about
him
i
can
understand
your
wanting
to
know
things
the
honesty
in
her
level
eyes
made
me
feel
ashamed
there
was
an
awkward
pause
in
our
conversation
she
fiddled
with
her
coffee
spoon
and
then
not
looking
up
said
timmy
told
you
about
eloise
did
he
tell
you
about
me
she
was
blushing
again
he
mentioned
you
he
did
say
much
i
could
make
something
up
to
make
you
feel
better
but
i
do
want
to
do
that
she
raised
her
head
to
look
directly
at
me
still
blushing
this
is
anything
to
go
in
your
book
but
it
nothing
i
ashamed
of
and
maybe
you
can
understand
him
better
or
me
better
if
i
tell
you
we
went
steady
during
our
senior
year
here
a
lot
of
the
kids
a
lot
of
our
friends
who
went
steady
taking
it
for
granted
that
they
were
going
to
get
married
as
soon
as
they
could
they
slept
together
it
was
almost
taken
for
granted
but
timmy
and
i
did
then
we
both
went
up
to
redding
we
were
both
away
from
home
we
were
lonely
and
in
a
new
environment
it
just
happened
it
got
pretty
intense
for
a
few
months
but
we
began
to
realize
that
it
was
helping
anything
we
stopped
oh
we
had
a
few
lapses
accidents
times
it
was
meant
to
happen
but
we
stopped
and
felt
very
proud
of
our
character
and
so
on
you
know
i
sometimes
wonder
if
that
is
what
spoiled
things
for
us
it
a
pretty
victorian
attitude
to
think
that
way
but
you
ca
help
wondering
sometimes
i
felt
ill
at
ease
with
her
i
had
never
come
across
this
particular
brand
of
honesty
she
had
freely
given
me
an
uncomfortable
truth
about
herself
and
i
felt
bound
to
reciprocate
i
said
too
quickly
i
know
what
you
mean
i
know
what
it
is
to
feel
guilty
from
the
man
point
of
view
when
they
tapped
my
shoulder
i
had
thirty
days
grace
before
i
had
to
report
i
had
a
girl
charlotte
and
a
pretty
good
job
we
wondered
if
we
ought
to
get
married
before
i
left
we
did
but
i
took
advantage
of
all
the
corny
melodrama
man
going
to
the
wars
and
so
on
i
twisted
it
so
she
believed
it
was
actually
her
duty
to
take
full
care
of
the
departing
warrior
it
was
a
pretty
frantic
thirty
days
so
off
i
went
smug
about
the
whole
thing
what
soft
words
had
been
able
to
accomplish
the
north
koreans
had
done
she
a
good
kid
but
you
back
and
you
not
married
no
i
came
back
in
pretty
bad
shape
my
digestive
system
is
back
to
par
yet
i
spent
quite
a
while
in
an
army
hospital
i
got
out
and
went
back
to
my
job
i
could
enjoy
it
i
used
to
enjoy
it
i
could
do
well
at
it
and
charlotte
seemed
like
a
stranger
at
least
i
had
enough
integrity
not
to
go
back
to
bed
with
her
she
was
willing
in
the
hopes
it
would
cure
the
mopes
i
was
listless
and
restless
i
could
figure
out
what
was
wrong
with
me
finally
they
got
tired
of
the
way
i
was
goofing
off
and
fired
me
so
i
left
i
started
this
project
i
feel
guilty
as
hell
about
charlotte
she
was
loyal
all
the
time
i
was
gone
she
thought
marriage
would
be
automatic
when
i
got
back
she
understand
all
this
and
neither
do
i
only
know
that
i
feel
guilty
and
i
still
feel
restless
what
is
she
like
tal
charlotte
she
quite
pretty
very
nice
eyes
she
a
tiny
girl
just
over
five
feet
and
maybe
a
hundred
pounds
sopping
wet
she
make
a
good
wife
she
quick
and
clean
and
capable
she
has
pretty
good
taste
and
her
daddy
has
yea
bucks
stashed
maybe
you
should
feel
guilty
i
frowned
at
her
what
do
you
mean
ruth
you
said
she
seems
like
a
stranger
maybe
she
is
a
stranger
tal
maybe
the
who
went
away
would
be
a
stranger
to
you
too
you
said
timmy
changed
you
could
have
changed
too
you
could
have
grown
up
in
ways
you
do
realize
maybe
the
charlotte
who
was
ample
for
that
other
tal
howard
just
is
enough
of
a
challenge
to
this
one
so
i
break
her
heart
maybe
better
to
break
her
heart
this
way
than
marry
her
and
break
it
slowly
and
more
thoroughly
i
can
explain
better
by
talking
about
timmy
and
me
i
do
understand
when
timmy
lost
interest
the
blow
was
less
than
i
thought
it
would
be
i
did
know
why
now
after
all
this
time
i
know
why
timmy
was
a
less
complicated
person
than
i
am
his
interests
were
narrower
he
lived
more
on
a
physical
level
than
i
do
things
stir
me
i
more
imaginative
than
he
was
just
as
you
are
more
imaginative
than
he
was
suppose
i
married
him
it
would
have
been
fine
for
a
time
but
inevitably
i
would
have
begun
to
feel
stifled
now
do
get
the
idea
that
i
sort
of
a
female
but
i
do
like
books
and
i
do
like
good
talk
and
i
do
like
all
manner
of
things
and
timmy
with
his
beer
and
bowling
and
sports
page
attitude
would
have
been
able
to
share
so
i
would
have
begun
to
feel
like
sticking
pins
in
him
do
you
understand
maybe
not
i
the
beer
bowling
and
sports
page
type
myself
she
watched
me
gravely
are
you
tal
it
was
an
uncomfortable
question
i
remembered
the
first
few
weeks
back
with
charlotte
when
i
tried
to
fit
back
into
the
pattern
of
the
life
i
had
known
before
our
friends
had
seemed
vapid
and
their
conversation
had
bored
me
charlotte
with
her
endless
yak
about
building
lots
and
what
color
draperies
and
television
epics
and
are
these
darling
shoes
for
only
four
and
what
color
do
you
like
me
best
in
and
yellow
kitchens
always
look
so
cheerful
charlotte
had
bored
me
too
my
charlotte
curled
like
a
kitten
against
me
in
the
movie
and
entranced
at
the
monster
images
on
the
screen
who
traded
platitudes
had
bored
me
i
began
to
sense
where
it
had
started
it
had
started
in
the
camp
boredom
was
the
enemy
and
all
my
traditional
defenses
against
boredom
had
withered
too
rapidly
the
improvised
game
of
checkers
was
but
another
form
of
boredom
i
was
used
to
being
with
a
certain
type
of
man
he
had
amused
and
entertained
me
and
i
him
but
in
the
camp
he
became
empty
he
with
his
talk
of
sexual
exploits
boyhood
victories
and
gargantuan
drunks
he
had
made
me
weary
just
to
listen
the
flight
from
boredom
had
stretched
my
mind
i
spent
more
and
more
time
in
the
company
of
the
characters
the
ones
who
before
capture
would
have
made
me
feel
queer
and
uncomfortable
the
ones
i
would
have
made
fun
of
behind
their
backs
there
was
a
frail
headquarters
type
with
a
mind
stuffed
full
of
things
i
had
never
heard
of
they
seemed
like
nonsense
at
first
and
soon
became
magical
there
was
a
corporal
muscled
like
a
tarzan
who
argued
with
a
mighty
ferocity
with
a
young
intense
mustachioed
marine
private
about
the
philosophy
and
ethics
of
art
while
i
sat
and
listened
and
felt
unknown
doors
open
in
my
mind
ruth
quiet
question
gave
me
the
first
valid
clue
to
my
own
discontent
could
i
shrink
myself
back
to
my
previous
dimensions
i
could
once
again
fit
into
the
world
of
job
and
charlotte
and
blue
draperies
and
a
yellow
kitchen
and
the
saturday
night
mixed
poker
game
with
our
crowd
if
i
could
not
shrink
myself
i
would
never
fit
there
again
and
i
did
not
wish
to
shrink
i
wished
to
stay
what
i
had
become
because
many
odd
things
had
become
meaningful
to
me
are
you
tal
she
asked
again
maybe
not
as
much
as
i
thought
i
was
you
hunting
for
something
she
said
the
strange
truth
of
that
statement
jolted
me
you
trying
to
do
a
book
that
just
an
indication
of
restlessness
you
hunting
for
what
you
should
be
or
for
what
you
really
are
she
grinned
suddenly
a
wide
grin
and
i
saw
that
one
white
tooth
was
entrancingly
crooked
dad
says
i
try
to
be
a
world
mother
pay
no
attention
to
me
i
always
diagnosing
and
prescribing
and
meddling
she
looked
at
her
watch
wow
he
be
stomping
and
thundering
i
got
to
go
right
now
i
paid
the
check
and
we
went
out
to
the
car
on
the
way
back
i
steered
the
conversation
to
the
point
where
i
could
say
and
i
remember
him
talking
about
a
girl
named
cindy
who
was
she
ruth
frowned
cindy
i
can
remember
some
no
there
was
any
girl
named
cindy
in
this
town
not
that
timmy
would
go
out
with
i
sure
he
never
knew
a
pretty
one
and
for
timmy
a
girl
had
to
be
pretty
are
you
certain
that
the
right
name
i
positive
of
it
but
what
did
he
say
about
her
he
just
mentioned
her
casually
a
few
times
but
in
a
way
that
sounded
as
though
he
knew
her
pretty
well
i
ca
remember
exactly
what
he
said
but
i
got
the
impression
he
knew
her
quite
well
it
defeats
me
ruth
said
i
turned
into
the
driveway
and
stopped
in
front
of
the
animal
hospital
and
got
out
as
she
did
we
had
been
at
ease
and
now
we
were
awkward
again
i
wanted
to
find
some
way
of
seeing
her
again
and
i
did
know
exactly
how
to
go
about
it
i
hoped
her
air
of
restraint
was
because
she
was
hoping
i
would
find
a
way
there
had
been
too
many
little
signs
and
hints
of
a
surprising
and
unexpected
closeness
between
us
she
could
not
help
but
be
aware
of
it
i
want
to
thank
you
ruth
i
said
and
put
my
hand
out
she
put
her
hand
in
mine
warm
and
firm
and
her
eyes
met
mine
and
slid
away
and
i
thought
she
flushed
a
bit
i
could
not
be
certain
i
glad
to
help
you
tal
you
could
let
me
know
if
you
think
of
more
questions
the
opening
was
there
but
it
was
too
easy
i
felt
a
compulsion
to
let
her
know
how
i
felt
i
like
to
be
with
you
again
even
if
it
not
about
the
book
she
pulled
her
hand
away
gently
and
faced
me
squarely
chin
up
i
think
i
like
that
too
she
grinned
again
see
a
complete
lack
of
traditional
female
technique
i
like
that
i
like
it
that
way
we
better
not
start
sounding
too
intense
tal
intense
i
do
know
i
carried
your
picture
a
long
time
it
meant
something
now
there
a
transition
you
mean
something
do
you
say
things
like
that
just
so
you
can
listen
to
yourself
saying
them
not
this
time
call
me
she
said
she
whirled
and
was
gone
just
before
she
went
in
the
door
i
remembered
what
i
meant
to
ask
her
i
called
to
her
and
she
stopped
and
i
went
up
to
her
who
should
i
talk
to
next
about
timmy
she
looked
slightly
disappointed
oh
try
leach
head
of
the
math
department
at
the
high
school
he
took
quite
an
interest
in
timmy
and
he
a
nice
guy
very
sweet
i
drove
back
into
town
full
of
the
look
of
her
full
of
the
impact
of
her
it
was
an
impact
that
made
the
day
the
trees
the
city
all
look
more
vivid
her
face
was
special
and
clear
in
my
mind
the
wide
mouth
the
one
crooked
tooth
the
gray
slant
of
her
eyes
her
figure
was
good
shoulders
just
a
bit
too
wide
hips
just
a
shade
too
narrow
to
be
classic
her
legs
were
long
with
clean
lines
her
flat
back
and
the
inswept
lines
of
her
waist
were
lovely
her
breasts
were
high
and
wide
spaced
with
a
flavor
of
impertinence
almost
arrogance
it
was
the
coloring
of
her
though
that
pleased
me
most
dark
red
of
the
hair
gray
of
the
eyes
golden
skin
tones
it
was
nearly
three
when
i
left
her
place
i
tried
to
put
her
out
of
my
mind
and
think
of
the
interview
with
leach
leach
might
be
the
link
with
cindy
i
must
have
been
a
half
mile
from
the
stamm
place
when
i
began
to
wonder
if
the
ford
coupé
behind
me
was
the
one
i
had
seen
beside
shed
i
made
two
turns
at
random
and
it
stayed
behind
me
there
was
no
attempt
at
the
traditional
nuances
of
shadowing
someone
he
tagged
along
a
hundred
feet
behind
me
i
pulled
over
onto
the
shoulder
and
got
out
i
saw
that
it
was
fitz
in
the
car
he
pulled
beyond
me
and
got
out
too
i
marched
up
to
him
and
said
what
the
hell
was
the
idea
of
going
through
my
room
he
leaned
on
his
car
you
have
a
nice
gentle
snore
howard
soothing
i
could
tell
the
police
sure
tell
them
all
he
squinted
in
the
afternoon
sunlight
he
looked
lazy
and
amused
what
good
does
it
do
you
to
follow
me
i
do
know
yet
have
a
nice
lunch
with
ruthie
she
a
nice
little
item
all
the
proper
equipment
she
did
go
for
me
at
all
maybe
she
likes
the
more
helpless
type
maybe
if
you
work
it
right
you
get
a
chance
to
take
her
to
he
stopped
abruptly
and
his
face
changed
he
looked
beyond
me
i
turned
just
in
time
to
see
a
dark
blue
sedan
approaching
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
it
sped
by
us
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
heavy
balding
man
with
a
hard
face
behind
the
wheel
alone
in
the
car
the
car
had
plates
but
it
was
gone
before
i
could
read
the
state
i
turned
back
to
fitz
there
no
point
in
following
me
around
i
told
you
i
do
know
any
more
i
stopped
because
there
was
no
point
in
going
on
he
looked
as
though
i
had
become
invisible
and
inaudible
he
brushed
by
me
and
got
into
his
car
and
drove
on
i
watched
it
recede
down
the
road
i
got
into
my
own
car
the
episode
made
no
sense
to
me
i
shrugged
it
off
my
mind
and
began
to
think
about
leach
again
four
though
the
kids
had
gone
the
doors
were
unlocked
and
a
janitor
sweeping
green
compound
down
the
tiles
of
the
corridor
told
me
i
could
probably
find
leach
in
his
office
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
old
building
the
two
buildings
new
and
old
were
connected
fire
doors
separated
the
frame
building
from
the
steel
and
concrete
one
my
steps
echoed
in
the
empty
corridor
with
a
metallic
ring
a
demure
little
girl
came
out
of
a
classroom
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
she
had
a
heavy
armload
of
books
she
looked
as
shy
and
gentle
and
timid
as
a
puppy
in
a
strange
yard
she
looked
at
me
quickly
and
hurried
on
down
the
corridor
ahead
of
me
moccasin
soles
slapping
meager
horsetail
bobbing
shoulders
hunched
i
found
the
right
door
and
tapped
on
it
a
tired
voice
told
me
to
come
in
leach
was
a
smallish
man
with
a
harsh
face
jet
eyebrows
a
gray
brushcut
he
sat
at
a
table
marking
papers
his
desk
behind
him
was
stacked
with
books
and
more
papers
something
i
can
do
for
you
my
name
is
tal
howard
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
a
student
you
used
to
have
he
shook
hands
without
enthusiasm
an
who
is
in
trouble
no
it
i
refreshed
not
in
trouble
fancy
that
the
faculty
has
many
callers
federal
narcotics
people
parole
people
prison
officials
county
police
lawyers
sometimes
it
seems
that
we
turn
out
nothing
but
criminals
of
all
dimensions
i
interrupted
you
i
do
want
to
impose
on
you
i
can
see
how
busy
you
are
gathering
material
about
timmy
warden
ruth
stamm
suggested
i
talk
to
you
he
leaned
back
and
rubbed
his
eyes
timmy
warden
gathering
material
that
has
the
sound
of
a
book
was
he
allowed
to
live
long
enough
to
give
you
enough
material
timmy
and
some
others
they
all
died
there
in
the
camp
i
was
there
too
i
almost
died
but
not
quite
sit
down
i
perfectly
willing
to
talk
about
him
i
take
it
not
a
professional
no
sir
then
this
as
a
labor
of
love
should
be
treated
with
all
respect
ruth
knows
as
much
about
timmy
as
any
person
alive
i
should
say
she
told
me
a
lot
and
i
got
a
lot
from
timmy
but
i
need
more
she
said
you
were
interested
in
him
i
was
howard
you
have
probably
heard
of
cretins
who
can
multiply
two
five
digit
numbers
mentally
and
give
the
answer
almost
instantaneously
yes
but
i
know
i
know
timmy
was
no
cretin
he
was
a
very
normal
young
man
almost
abnormally
normal
if
you
sense
what
i
mean
yet
he
had
a
spark
creative
mathematics
he
could
sense
the
the
rhythm
behind
numbers
he
devised
unique
short
cuts
in
the
solution
of
traditional
class
problems
he
had
that
rare
talent
the
ability
to
grasp
intricate
relationships
and
see
them
in
pure
simple
form
but
there
was
no
drive
no
dedication
without
dedication
howard
such
ability
is
merely
facility
an
empty
cleverness
i
hoped
to
be
a
mathematician
i
teach
mathematics
in
a
high
school
merely
because
i
did
not
have
enough
of
what
timmy
warden
was
born
with
i
hoped
that
one
day
he
would
acquire
the
dedication
but
he
never
had
time
i
guess
he
did
even
if
he
had
the
time
i
doubt
if
he
would
have
gone
any
further
he
was
a
very
good
decent
young
man
everything
was
too
easy
for
him
it
was
easy
at
the
end
i
do
imagine
it
was
nor
easy
for
hundreds
of
millions
of
his
contemporaries
anywhere
in
the
world
this
is
a
bad
century
howard
bad
for
the
young
bad
for
most
of
us
what
do
you
think
would
have
become
of
him
if
he
lived
mr
leach
the
man
shrugged
nothing
exceptional
marriage
work
children
and
death
no
contribution
his
name
gone
as
if
it
never
existed
one
of
the
faceless
ones
like
us
mr
howard
he
rubbed
his
eyes
again
then
smiled
wanly
i
not
usually
so
depressing
howard
this
has
been
a
bad
week
this
is
one
of
the
weeks
that
add
to
my
conviction
that
something
is
eating
our
young
this
week
the
children
have
seemed
more
sullen
dangerous
dispirited
inane
vicious
foolish
and
impossible
than
usual
this
week
a
young
sophomore
in
one
of
my
classes
went
into
the
hospital
with
septicemia
as
the
result
of
a
abortion
and
a
rather
pleasant
boy
was
slashed
and
last
monday
two
seniors
died
in
a
collision
while
on
their
way
back
from
redding
full
of
liquor
the
man
in
the
other
car
is
not
expected
to
recover
when
timmy
was
here
in
school
i
was
crying
doom
but
it
was
not
like
it
is
now
by
comparison
those
were
the
good
old
days
recent
as
they
are
was
timmy
a
disciplinary
problem
no
he
was
lazy
sometimes
he
created
disturbances
on
the
whole
he
was
i
used
to
hope
ruth
would
be
the
one
to
wake
him
up
she
a
solid
person
too
good
for
him
perhaps
i
guess
he
was
pretty
popular
with
the
girls
very
as
with
nearly
everything
else
things
were
too
easy
for
him
he
mentioned
some
of
them
in
camp
judy
ruth
cindy
i
could
be
expected
to
identify
them
if
i
remember
correctly
i
once
had
eight
judys
in
one
class
now
that
name
thank
god
is
beginning
to
die
out
a
little
there
have
never
been
too
many
cindys
yet
there
has
been
a
small
constant
supply
i
want
to
have
a
chance
to
talk
to
the
girls
he
mentioned
i
talked
to
ruth
judy
has
moved
away
i
ca
remember
cindy
last
name
i
wonder
if
there
is
any
way
i
could
get
a
look
at
the
list
of
students
in
hopes
of
identifying
her
i
guess
you
could
he
said
the
administration
office
will
be
empty
by
now
you
could
ask
them
monday
let
me
see
timmy
graduated
in
i
keep
old
yearbooks
here
they
over
there
on
that
bottom
shelf
you
could
take
the
ones
for
that
year
and
the
next
two
years
and
look
them
over
there
by
the
window
if
you
like
i
have
to
get
on
with
these
papers
and
i
really
ca
tell
you
much
more
about
timmy
i
liked
him
and
had
hopes
for
him
but
he
lacked
motivation
that
seems
to
be
the
trouble
with
too
many
of
the
children
lately
no
motivation
they
see
no
goal
worth
working
for
they
no
longer
have
any
dreams
they
are
content
with
the
manufactured
dreams
of
and
columbia
i
sat
by
the
windows
and
went
through
the
yearbooks
there
was
no
cindy
in
the
yearbook
for
there
was
one
in
the
yearbook
i
knew
when
i
saw
her
picture
that
she
could
not
be
the
one
she
was
a
great
fat
girl
with
small
pinched
discontented
features
sullen
rebellious
little
eyes
there
was
a
cindy
in
the
yearbook
she
had
a
narrow
face
protruding
teeth
weak
eyes
behind
heavy
lenses
an
expression
of
overwhelming
stupidity
yet
i
marked
down
their
names
it
would
be
worth
a
try
i
thought
i
went
back
to
the
yearbook
and
went
through
page
after
page
of
graduates
more
thoroughly
i
came
to
a
girl
named
cynthia
cooper
she
was
a
reasonably
attractive
blonde
i
wondered
if
timmy
could
possibly
have
said
cynthy
it
would
be
an
awkward
nickname
for
cynthia
and
even
though
his
voice
by
that
time
had
been
weak
and
blurred
i
was
certain
he
had
said
cindy
he
had
repeated
the
name
but
i
wrote
her
down
too
ruth
stamm
yearbook
picture
was
not
very
good
but
the
promise
of
her
the
clear
hint
of
what
she
would
become
was
there
in
her
face
her
activities
listed
under
the
picture
made
a
long
list
it
was
the
same
with
timmy
he
grinned
into
the
camera
leach
looked
up
at
me
when
i
stood
near
his
table
any
luck
i
took
down
some
names
they
might
help
i
thanked
him
for
his
help
he
was
bent
over
his
papers
again
before
i
got
to
the
door
odd
little
guy
with
his
own
strange
brand
of
dedication
and
concern
pompous
little
man
but
with
an
of
kindness
i
got
to
the
hillston
inn
at
a
little
after
five
i
got
some
dimes
from
the
cashier
and
went
over
to
where
four
phone
booths
stood
flanked
against
the
lobby
wall
i
looked
up
the
last
name
of
the
fat
girl
cindy
waskowitz
there
were
two
waskowitzes
in
the
book
john
and
i
tried
john
first
a
woman
with
a
nasal
voice
answered
the
phone
i
trying
to
locate
a
girl
named
cindy
waskowitz
who
graduated
from
hillston
high
in
nineteen
is
this
her
home
hold
it
a
minute
the
woman
said
i
could
hear
her
talking
to
someone
else
in
the
room
i
could
make
out
what
she
was
saying
she
came
back
on
the
line
you
want
to
know
about
cindy
that
right
please
this
was
her
home
but
i
can
tell
you
about
her
i
her
aunt
you
want
to
know
about
her
please
it
was
the
glands
i
could
remember
the
word
my
daughter
just
told
me
the
glands
when
she
got
out
from
high
school
she
weighed
two
hundred
from
there
she
went
up
like
balloons
two
hundred
two
fifty
three
hundred
when
she
died
in
the
hospital
she
was
nearly
four
hundred
she
been
over
four
hundred
once
just
before
she
went
in
the
hospital
glands
it
was
i
remembered
the
rebellious
eyes
girl
trapped
inside
the
prison
of
white
soft
flesh
a
dancing
girl
a
lithe
girl
forever
lost
inside
that
slow
inevitable
encroachment
stilled
finally
and
buried
inside
her
suet
prison
is
your
daughter
about
the
same
age
cindy
would
have
been
a
year
older
she
married
and
three
kids
already
the
woman
chuckled
warmly
could
i
talk
to
your
daughter
sure
just
a
minute
the
daughter
voice
was
colder
edged
with
thin
suspicion
what
goes
on
anyhow
why
do
you
want
to
know
about
cindy
i
was
wondering
if
she
was
ever
friendly
in
high
school
with
a
boy
named
timmy
warden
timmy
is
dead
it
was
in
the
papers
i
know
that
were
they
friendly
timmy
and
cindy
geez
that
a
tasty
combination
he
would
have
known
who
she
was
on
account
of
her
being
such
a
tub
but
i
do
think
he
ever
spoke
to
her
why
should
he
he
had
all
the
glamour
items
hanging
around
his
neck
why
are
you
asking
all
this
i
was
in
the
camp
with
him
before
he
died
he
gave
me
a
message
to
deliver
to
a
girl
named
cindy
i
wondered
if
cindy
was
the
one
not
a
chance
sorry
you
just
got
the
wrong
one
was
there
another
cindy
in
the
class
in
one
of
the
lower
classes
a
one
that
the
only
one
i
can
remember
all
teeth
glasses
a
sandy
sort
of
girl
i
remember
her
last
name
though
cindy
kirschner
that
the
name
gosh
i
do
know
where
you
find
her
i
think
i
saw
her
downtown
once
a
year
ago
maybe
it
in
the
book
but
i
think
she
fit
any
better
than
my
cousin
i
mean
timmy
warden
ran
around
with
his
own
group
kind
of
big
shots
in
the
school
that
kirschner
was
in
that
class
any
more
than
my
cousin
or
me
the
bitterness
was
implicit
in
her
tone
i
thanked
her
again
she
hung
up
i
tried
kirschner
there
was
only
one
in
the
book
ralph
j
a
woman
answered
the
phone
i
trying
to
locate
a
cindy
kirschner
who
graduated
from
hillston
high
in
nineteen
that
my
daughter
who
is
this
calling
please
could
you
tell
me
how
i
could
locate
her
she
married
but
she
does
have
a
phone
they
have
to
use
the
one
at
the
corner
store
she
does
like
to
have
people
call
her
there
because
it
a
nuisance
to
the
people
at
the
store
and
she
has
small
children
she
does
like
to
leave
to
go
down
there
and
answer
the
phone

you
want
to
see
her
you
could
go
out

of
butternut

little
blue
house

repeated
the
directions
and
said

much
kirschner

appreciate
your
help
i
hung
up
i
was
tempted
to
try
cynthia
cooper
but
decided
i
had
better
take
one
at
a
time
eliminate
one
before
starting
the
next
i
stepped
out
of
the
booth
earl
fitzmartin
stepped
out
of
the
adjoining
booth
he
smiled
at
me
almost
genially
so
it
got
something
to
do
with
somebody
named
cindy
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
was
in
camp
with
timmy
before
he
died
he
gave
me
a
message
to
deliver
to
a
girl
named
cindy
so
you
try
two
cindy
in
a
row
and
you
know
when
they
graduated
busy
are
you
go
to
hell
fitz
he
stood
with
his
big
hard
fists
on
his
hips
rocking
back
and
forth
from
heel
to
toe
smiling
placidly
at
me
you
busy
tal
nice
little
lunch
with
ruth
trip
to
the
high
school
tracking
down
cindy
does
she
know
where
the
loot
is
he
was
wearing
a
dark
suit
well
cut
it
looked
expensive
his
shoes
were
shined
his
shirt
crisp
i
wished
i
been
more
alert
it
no
great
trick
to
stand
in
one
phone
booth
and
listen
to
the
conversation
in
the
adjoining
one
i
had
even
thought
of
secrecy
of
making
certain
i
could
be
overheard
now
he
had
almost
as
much
as
i
did
how
did
you
get
along
with
george
howard
i
got
along
fine
strange
guy
is
he
he
a
little
odd
and
he
damn
near
broke
that
a
shame
is
it
it
too
bad
the
stamm
girl
comes
around
and
holds
his
hand
maybe
it
makes
him
feel
better
poor
guy
you
know
he
even
had
to
sell
the
cabin
did
timmy
ever
talk
about
the
cabin
he
had
talked
about
it
when
we
were
first
imprisoned
i
forgotten
about
it
until
that
moment
i
remembered
timmy
saying
that
it
was
on
a
small
lake
a
rustic
cabin
their
father
had
built
he
and
george
had
gone
there
to
fish
many
times
he
mentioned
it
i
said
i
heard
about
it
after
i
got
here
it
seemed
like
a
good
place
so
i
went
up
there
with
my
little
shovel
no
dice
tal
i
dug
up
most
of
the
lake
shore
i
dug
a
hundred
holes
see
how
nice
i
am
to
you
that
one
more
place
where
it
is
later
on
george
let
me
use
it
for
a
while
before
he
sold
it
it
nice
up
there
you
like
it
but
it
clean
thanks
for
the
information
i
keeping
an
eye
on
you
tal
i
interested
in
your
progress
keep
in
touch
you
do
that
blackman
runs
east
off
delaware
it
starts
three
blocks
north
of
here
butternut
must
be
about
fourteen
blocks
over
it
not
hard
to
find
thanks
i
turned
on
my
heel
and
left
him
it
was
dusk
when
i
headed
out
blackman
i
found
butternut
without
difficulty
i
found
the
blue
house
and
parked
in
front
as
i
went
up
the
walk
toward
the
front
door
the
first
light
went
on
inside
the
house
i
pushed
the
bell
and
she
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
at
me
the
light
behind
her
child
in
her
arms
mrs
rorick
i
rorick
she
said
her
voice
was
soft
and
warm
and
pleasant
you
were
cindy
kirschner
then
i
was
a
friend
of
timmy
warden
in
prison
camp
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
said
wo
you
come
in
a
minute
when
i
was
inside
and
she
had
turned
toward
the
light
i
could
see
her
better
the
teeth
had
been
fixed
her
face
was
fuller
she
was
still
a
colorless
woman
with
heavy
glasses
but
now
there
was
a
pride
about
her
a
confidence
that
had
been
lacking
in
the
picture
i
had
seen
another
child
sat
on
a
small
tricycle
and
gave
me
a
stare
both
children
looked
very
much
like
her
rorick
did
not
ask
me
to
sit
down
how
well
did
you
know
timmy
mrs
rorick
i
do
think
he
ever
knew
i
was
alive
in
camp
before
he
died
he
mentioned
a
cindy
could
you
have
been
the
one
i
certainly
doubt
that
it
confused
me
i
said
when
i
mentioned
him
you
asked
me
to
come
in
i
thought
she
smiled
i
guess
i
have
to
tell
you
i
had
the
most
fantastic
and
awful
crush
on
him
for
years
and
years
it
was
pathetic
whenever
we
were
in
the
same
class
i
used
to
stare
at
him
all
the
time
i
wrote
letters
to
him
and
tore
them
up
i
sent
him
unsigned
cards
at
easter
and
valentine
day
and
christmas
and
on
his
birthday
i
knew
when
his
birthday
was
because
once
a
girl
i
knew
went
to
a
party
at
his
house
it
was
really
awful
it
gave
me
a
lot
of
miserable
years
now
it
seems
funny
but
it
was
funny
then
it
started
in
the
sixth
or
seventh
grade
he
was
two
grades
ahead
it
lasted
until
he
graduated
from
high
school
he
had
a
red
knit
cap
he
wore
in
winter
i
stole
it
from
the
cloakroom
i
slept
with
it
under
my
pillow
for
months
and
months
that
ridiculous
she
was
very
pleasant
i
smiled
back
at
her
you
got
over
it
oh
yes
at
last
and
then
i
met
pat
i
sorry
about
timmy
that
was
a
terrible
thing
no
if
he
mentioned
any
cindy
it
was
me
maybe
he
would
know
me
by
sight
but
i
do
think
he
know
my
name
could
he
have
meant
some
other
cindy
it
would
have
to
be
some
other
cindy
but
i
ca
think
who
there
was
a
girl
named
cindy
waskowitz
but
it
could
have
been
her
either
she
dead
now
can
you
think
of
who
it
could
be
she
frowned
and
shook
her
head
slowly
n
no
i
ca
something
in
the
back
of
my
mind
though
from
a
long
time
ago
something
i
heard
or
saw
i
do
know
i
should
even
try
to
guess
it
so
vague
no
i
ca
help
you
but
the
name
cindy
means
something
for
a
moment
i
thought
it
did
it
gone
now
i
sorry
if
you
remember
could
you
get
in
touch
with
me
she
smiled
broadly
you
have
told
me
who
you
are
i
sorry
my
name
is
howard
tal
howard
i
staying
at
the
sunset
motel
you
could
leave
a
message
there
for
me
why
are
you
so
interested
in
finding
this
cindy
i
could
at
least
be
consistent
i
writing
a
book
i
need
all
the
information
about
timmy
that
i
can
get
put
in
the
book
that
he
was
kind
put
that
in
in
what
way
mrs
rorick
she
shifted
uneasily
i
used
to
have
dreadful
buck
teeth
my
people
could
never
afford
to
have
them
fixed
one
day
that
when
i
was
in
john
davis
school
that
the
grade
school
where
timmy
went
too
and
it
was
before
they
built
the
junior
high
i
was
in
the
sixth
grade
and
timmy
was
in
the
eighth
a
boy
came
with
some
funny
teeth
that
stuck
way
out
like
mine
he
put
them
in
his
mouth
in
assembly
and
he
was
making
faces
at
me
i
was
trying
not
to
cry
a
lot
of
them
were
laughing
timmy
took
the
teeth
away
from
the
boy
and
dropped
them
on
the
floor
and
smashed
them
under
his
heel
i
never
forgot
that
i
started
working
while
i
was
in
high
school
and
saving
money
i
had
enough
after
i
was
out
to
go
to
get
my
teeth
straightened
but
it
was
too
late
to
straighten
them
then
so
i
had
them
taken
out
i
wanted
marriage
and
i
wanted
children
and
the
way
i
was
no
man
would
even
take
me
out
she
straightened
her
shoulders
a
little
i
guess
it
worked
she
said
i
guess
it
did
so
put
that
in
the
book
it
belongs
in
the
book
i
will
and
if
i
can
remember
that
other
i
phone
you
mr
howard
i
thanked
her
and
left
i
drove
back
toward
the
center
of
town
i
began
to
think
of
fitz
again
ruth
was
right
when
she
used
the
word
creepy
but
it
was
more
than
that
you
sensed
that
fitz
was
a
man
who
would
not
be
restrained
by
the
things
that
restrain
the
rest
of
us
he
had
proved
in
the
camp
that
he
did
give
a
damn
what
people
thought
of
him
he
depended
on
himself
to
an
almost
psychopathic
extent
it
made
you
feel
helpless
in
trying
to
deal
with
him
you
could
think
of
no
appeal
that
would
work
he
could
be
scared
or
reasoned
with
he
was
as
primitive
and
functional
as
the
design
of
an
ax
he
could
not
even
be
anticipated
because
his
logic
was
not
of
normal
pattern
and
then
too
there
was
the
startling
physical
strength
in
camp
i
had
seen
several
minor
exhibitions
of
that
power
but
only
one
that
showed
the
true
extent
of
it
those
of
us
who
saw
it
talked
about
it
a
long
time
the
guards
who
saw
it
treated
fitz
with
uneasy
respect
after
that
one
of
the
supply
trucks
became
mired
inside
the
compound
rear
duals
down
to
the
hubs
they
broke
a
towline
trying
to
snake
it
out
then
they
rounded
up
a
bunch
of
us
to
unload
the
supply
truck
the
cases
aboard
had
obviously
been
loaded
on
with
a
winch
we
got
all
the
stuff
off
except
one
big
wooden
packing
case
we
never
did
learn
what
was
in
it
we
only
knew
it
was
heavy
we
were
trying
to
get
a
crude
dolly
under
it
but
when
we
tilted
it
we
could
get
the
dolly
far
enough
back
every
guard
was
yelling
incomprehensible
orders
i
imagine
fitz
lost
patience
he
jumped
up
into
the
bed
of
the
truck
put
his
back
against
the
case
squatted
and
got
his
fingers
under
the
edge
then
he
came
up
with
it
his
face
a
mask
of
effort
cords
standing
out
on
his
throat
he
lifted
it
high
enough
so
the
dolly
could
be
put
under
it
he
lowered
it
again
and
jumped
down
off
the
truck
oddly
pale
and
perspiring
heavily
once
it
was
rolled
to
the
tail
gate
on
the
dolly
enough
men
could
get
hold
of
it
to
ease
it
down
when
it
was
on
the
ground
one
of
the
biggest
of
the
guards
swaggered
up
grinning
at
his
friends
and
tried
to
do
what
fitz
had
done
he
could
budge
it
he
and
one
of
his
friends
got
it
up
a
few
inches
but
not
as
high
as
fitz
had
they
were
humiliated
and
they
took
it
out
on
the
rest
of
us
but
not
on
fitz
he
was
left
alone
back
in
town
i
decided
i
would
have
a
drink
at
the
inn
and
a
solitary
meal
and
try
to
think
of
what
the
next
step
should
be
i
was
picked
up
in
front
of
the
inn
ten
steps
from
my
car
five
there
were
two
of
them
one
was
a
thin
sandy
man
in
uniform
and
the
other
was
a
massive
man
in
a
gray
suit
with
a
pouched
florid
face
your
name
howard
yes
it
is
police
come
on
along
what
for
lieutenant
wants
to
talk
to
you
i
went
along
they
put
me
in
a
police
sedan
and
drove
about
eight
blocks
and
turned
into
an
enclosed
courtyard
through
a
gray
stone
arch
other
cars
were
parked
there
they
took
me
through
a
door
that
was
one
of
several
opening
onto
the
courtyard
we
went
up
wide
wooden
stairs
that
were
badly
worn
to
the
second
floor
it
was
an
old
building
with
an
institutional
smell
of
dust
carbolic
and
urine
we
went
by
open
doors
one
door
opened
onto
a
big
file
room
with
fluorescent
lights
and
gray
steel
filing
cases
some
men
played
cards
in
another
room
i
could
hear
the
metallic
gabbling
voice
of
some
sort
of
communication
system
we
turned
into
a
small
office
where
a
thin
bald
man
sat
behind
a
desk
that
faced
the
door
his
face
was
young
with
a
swarthy
indian
harshness
about
it
black
brows
his
hands
were
large
he
looked
tall
a
small
wooden
sign
on
his
desk
said
stephen
the
office
had
cracked
buff
plaster
walls
books
and
pamphlets
were
piled
in
disorder
in
a
bookcase
a
smallish
man
with
white
hair
and
a
red
whisky
face
sat
half
behind
lieutenant
prine
on
the
small
gilded
radiator
in
front
of
the
single
window
one
of
the
men
behind
me
gave
me
an
unnecessary
push
that
made
me
thump
my
knee
against
the
front
of
the
desk
and
almost
lose
my
balance
prine
looked
at
me
with
complete
coldness
this
is
that
howard
one
of
the
men
behind
me
said
okay
the
door
behind
me
closed
i
glanced
back
and
saw
that
the
man
in
uniform
had
left
the
big
man
in
the
gray
suit
leaned
against
the
closed
door
empty
your
pockets
onto
the
desk
prine
said
everything
but
empty
your
pockets
there
was
no
threat
in
the
words
cold
bored
command
i
put
everything
on
the
desk
wallet
change
pen
and
pencil
notebook
cigarettes
lighter
penknife
folder
of
traveler
checks
prine
reached
a
big
hand
over
and
separated
the
items
into
two
piles
notebook
wallet
and
checks
in
one
pile
that
he
pulled
toward
him
put
the
rest
of
that
stuff
back
in
your
pockets
could
i
ask
why
shut
up
i
stood
in
uncomfortable
silence
while
he
went
through
my
wallet
he
looked
carefully
at
every
card
and
piece
of
paper
at
the
photograph
of
charlotte
at
the
reduced
photostat
of
my
discharge
laminated
in
plastic
he
went
through
the
notebook
and
then
examined
the
checks
now
answer
some
questions
he
opened
a
desk
drawer
flipped
a
switch
and
said

of
those
student
riots
disturbing
the
peace
and
resisting
an
officer
were
you
booked
and
mugged
and
fingerprinted

then
you
have
a
criminal
record
how
long
have
you
been
in
hillston
i
arrived
here
wednesday
night
two
days
what
is
your
local
address
the
sunset
motel
on
this
vehicle
registration
do
you
own
the

yes

have
a
little
over
a
thousand
dollars
where
did
you
get
it
i
earned
it
i
saved
it
i
getting
a
little
sick
of
all
this
beginning
to
make
me
sore
why
did
you
come
to
hillston
do
i
have
to
have
a
reason
yes
you
need
a
reason
i
knew
timmy
warden
in
prison
camp
and
i
knew
others
there
that
did
come
back
i
going
to
write
a
book
about
them
there
my
notes
you
have
them
there
why
did
you
tell
george
warden
that
i
did
know
how
he
take
it
you
did
tell
fitzmartin
either
he
has
no
reason
to
know
my
business
but
you
went
out
there
to
see
him
and
you
were
both
in
the
same
camp
with
timmy
warden
it
would
seem
natural
to
tell
him
i
do
care
how
it
seems
i
did
tell
him
if
a
man
came
to
town
with
a
story
about
writing
a
book
it
would
give
him
a
chance
to
nose
around
would
it
i
guess
it
would
what
else
have
you
written
nothing
else
are
you
familiar
with
the
state
laws
and
local
ordinances
covering
private
investigators
i
stared
at
him
blankly
no
are
you
licensed
in
any
state
no
i
do
know
what
if
you
were
licensed
it
would
be
necessary
for
you
to
find
out
whether
this
state
has
any
reciprocal
agreement
if
so
you
would
merely
have
to
make
a
courtesy
call
and
announce
your
presence
in
this
county
and
give
the
name
of
your
employer
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
do
you
know
a
woman
named
rose
fulton
no
i
never
heard
of
her
were
you
employed
by
rose
fulton
to
come
to
hillston
no
i
told
you
i
never
heard
of
her
we
were
advised
a
month
ago
that
rose
fulton
had
hired
an
investigator
to
come
here
on
an
undercover
assignment
we
been
looking
for
the
man
he
would
be
the
third
one
she
sent
here
the
first
two
made
a
botch
of
their
job
there
was
no
job
here
for
them
in
the
first
place
rose
fulton
is
a
persistent
and
misguided
woman
the
case
if
there
was
any
case
was
completely
investigated
by
this
department
part
of
our
job
is
to
keep
citizens
of
hillston
from
being
annoyed
and
persecuted
by
people
who
have
no
business
here
is
that
clear
to
you
i
do
understand
what
you
talking
about
i
really
do
he
looked
at
me
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
then
he
said
end
of
interrogation
witnessed
by
brubaker
and
sparkman
copies
for
file
prine
he
clicked
the
switch
and
closed
the
desk
drawer
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
yawned
then
pushed
my
wallet
checks
and
notebook
toward
me
it
just
this
howard
we
get
damned
tired
of
characters
nosing
around
here
the
implication
is
that
we
did
do
our
job
the
hell
we
did
this
rose
fulton
is
the
wife
of
the
guy
who
ran
off
with
george
warden
wife
eloise
that
name
fulton
sounded
familiar
but
i
did
know
why
it
happened
nearly
two
years
ago
the
first
inquiry
came
from
the
company
fulton
worked
for
we
did
some
hard
work
on
it
fulton
was
in
town
for
three
days
he
was
registered
at
the
hillston
inn
he
stayed
there
every
time
he
was
in
town
on
the
last
night
he
was
here
friday
night
he
had
dinner
at
the
hotel
with
eloise
warden
she
waited
in
the
lobby
and
he
checked
out
they
got
in
his
car
they
drove
to
the
warden
house
eloise
went
in
fulton
waited
out
in
the
car
it
was
the
evening
of
the
eleventh
of
april
a
neighbor
saw
him
waiting
and
saw
her
come
out
to
the
car
with
a
big
suitcase
they
drove
off
george
warden
had
reported
it
to
us
he
knew
what
the
score
was
when
he
got
back
to
town
and
saw
the
things
she
taken
it
was
an
open
and
shut
situation
it
happens
all
the
time
but
rose
fulton
ca
bring
herself
to
believe
that
her
dear
husband
would
take
off
with
another
woman
so
she
keeps
sicking
these
investigators
on
us
you
could
be
the
third
i
do
think
so
no
proof
just
a
hunch
she
thinks
something
happened
to
him
here
we
know
nothing
happened
to
him
here
i
lost
patience
so
this
time
we
making
it
tough
you
can
go
if
i
happen
to
be
wrong
if
you
happen
to
be
hired
by
that
crazy
dame
you
better
keep
right
on
going
friend
we
got
a
small
force
here
but
we
know
our
business
the
big
man
moved
away
from
the
door
to
let
me
out
there
was
no
offer
of
a
ride
back
to
where
they
had
picked
me
up
i
walked
the
walk
was
long
enough
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
inn
i
was
still
sore
at
prine
and
company
i
could
grudgingly
admit
that
maybe
he
thought
he
had
cause
to
swing
his
weight
around
but
i
did
like
being
picked
up
like
that
and
it
had
irritated
me
to
have
to
tell
them
i
had
no
job
no
permanent
residence
i
was
certain
what
legal
right
they
had
to
take
that
sort
of
a
statement
from
me
i
had
a
drink
at
the
dark
bar
at
the
end
of
the
cocktail
lounge
at
the
inn
business
was
light
i
nursed
my
drink
and
wondered
how
they
had
picked
me
up
so
quickly
i
guessed
it
was
from
the
motel
register
had
to
write
down
the
make
of
my
car
and
the
license
number
known
who
i
talked
to
and
what
had
been
said
it
was
a
small
city
and
they
acted
like
men
who
made
a
business
of
knowing
what
was
going
on
just
as
i
ordered
the
second
drink
i
saw
a
big
man
come
in
and
stand
at
the
other
end
of
the
bar
he
looked
like
the
man
i
had
seen
in
the
blue
sedan
but
i
could
be
certain
i
had
forgotten
him
and
the
effect
he
had
had
on
fitzmartin
he
became
aware
of
my
interest
he
turned
and
gave
me
a
long
look
and
turned
back
to
the
drink
the
bartender
put
in
front
of
him
he
had
moved
his
head
slowly
when
he
turned
to
look
at
me
his
eyes
were
in
shadow
i
had
a
sudden
instinctive
premonition
of
danger
fitz
was
danger
but
a
known
quantity
i
did
not
know
this
man
or
where
he
fitted
in
i
did
not
want
to
attempt
to
ask
him
he
finished
his
drink
quickly
and
left
i
looked
down
into
my
drink
and
saw
myself
lying
dead
sprawled
cold
it
was
a
fantasy
that
had
been
with
me
in
the
prison
camp
and
later
you
think
of
your
own
death
you
try
to
imagine
how
it
will
be
to
just
cease
abruptly
eternally
it
is
a
chilling
thought
and
once
you
have
started
it
it
is
difficult
to
shake
off
the
depression
stayed
with
me
the
rest
of
the
evening
thoughts
of
ruth
of
the
new
emphasis
she
had
brought
into
my
life
did
little
to
relieve
the
blackness
and
the
hint
of
fear
my
mission
in
hillston
seemed
pointless
it
was
part
of
running
away
from
myself
there
was
no
chance
of
finding
the
money
and
even
if
there
was
and
i
did
find
it
i
could
imagine
it
changing
anything
somehow
i
had
become
a
misfit
in
my
world
in
my
time
i
had
been
jolted
out
of
one
comfortable
rut
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
place
where
i
could
fit
other
than
charlotte
and
too
optimistically
ruth
i
could
think
of
no
one
who
gave
a
special
damn
whether
i
lived
or
died
after
the
light
was
out
i
lay
in
darkness
and
surrendered
myself
to
the
great
waves
of
bathos
and
i
wondered
what
would
become
of
me
i
wondered
how
soon
i
would
be
dead
i
wondered
how
many
other
lonely
beds
there
would
be
and
where
they
would
be
finally
i
fell
asleep
six
saturday
morning
was
dreary
with
damp
winds
low
scudding
clouds
lights
on
in
the
stores
i
could
get
a
better
line
on
the
cooper
girl
until
the
administration
office
at
the
high
school
opened
on
monday
the
few
leads
had
faded
away
into
nothing
i
wondered
what
i
would
do
with
the
day
after
buying
some
blades
and
some
tooth
paste
i
drove
around
for
a
while
and
finally
faced
the
fact
that
i
was
trying
to
think
of
a
good
excuse
to
see
ruth
stamm
i
went
without
an
excuse
she
was
in
the
reception
office
at
the
animal
hospital
she
gave
me
a
quick
warm
smile
as
i
walked
in
a
woman
sat
holding
a
small
shivering
dog
waiting
her
turn
there
was
a
boy
with
a
siamese
cat
on
a
leash
the
cat
dainty
and
arrogant
purposefully
ignored
the
shivering
dog
ruth
smiling
asked
in
a
low
voice
more
questions
no
questions
just
general
depression
wrong
kind
of
hospital
tal
but
the
right
kind
of
personnel
need
some
kind
of
therapy
something
like
that
she
looked
at
her
watch
come
back
at
twelve
we
close
at
noon
on
saturday
i
feed
you
and
we
cook
up
something
to
do
the
day
was
not
as
dreary
when
i
drove
away
i
returned
at
twelve
i
went
up
to
the
house
with
her
and
the
three
of
us
ate
in
the
big
kitchen
buck
stamm
was
a
skilled
storyteller
apparently
every
misfortune
that
could
happen
to
a
veterinary
had
happened
to
him
he
reviled
his
profession
and
his
own
stupidity
in
getting
into
it
in
the
first
place
after
a
cigar
he
went
off
to
make
farm
calls
i
helped
ruth
with
a
few
dishes
how
about
a
plain
old
tour
of
the
surrounding
country
she
suggested
there
are
parts
that
are
very
nice
then
dinner
tonight
and
a
movie
or
something
sold
it
saturday
night
she
changed
to
slacks
and
a
tweed
jacket
over
a
yellow
sweater
and
we
took
my
car
she
gave
me
the
directions
we
took
small
back
roads
it
was
pretty
country
with
rolling
hills
and
spines
of
rock
that
stuck
out
of
the
hills
in
the
city
the
day
had
been
gloomy
out
in
the
country
it
was
no
better
but
the
breeze
seemed
moist
with
spring
the
new
leaves
were
a
pale
green
she
sat
slouched
in
the
seat
with
one
knee
up
against
the
glove
compartment
and
pointed
out
the
farms
told
me
about
the
people
told
me
about
the
history
of
the
area
at
her
suggestion
i
took
a
back
road
that
led
to
a
place
called
highland
lake
she
told
me
when
to
slow
down
when
we
came
to
a
dirt
road
we
turned
right
a
mile
down
the
slippery
muddy
road
was
a
sign
that
said
i
went
cautiously
down
an
overgrown
drive
through
the
woods
until
we
came
to
a
small
cabin
with
a
big
porch
overlooking
a
small
lake
less
than
a
mile
long
and
half
as
wide
i
could
see
other
cabins
in
the
trees
along
the
lake
shore
we
went
onto
the
cabin
porch
and
sat
on
the
railing
and
smoked
and
talked
and
watched
the
quick
winds
furrow
the
lake
surface
we
do
get
up
here
as
much
as
we
used
to
when
mother
was
alive
dad
talks
about
selling
it
but
i
do
think
he
will
he
hunts
up
here
in
the
fall
it
only
eighteen
miles
from
town
the
shortest
way
pretty
primitive
but
you
know
tal
this
would
be
a
good
place
to
write
i
felt
again
a
quick
sharp
pang
of
guilt
her
enthusiasm
grew
nobody
is
using
it
there
no
electricity
but
there
are
oil
lamps
and
a
coleman
lantern
there
plenty
of
wood
in
the
shed
and
one
of
those
little
gasoline
stoves
the
bunks
are
comfortable
and
there
lots
of
blankets
it
would
save
paying
rent
i
know
dad
would
mind
a
bit
thanks
ruth
but
really
i
could
why
not
it
only
a
half
hour
to
town
i
do
think
i
be
here
long
enough
to
make
it
worth
while
moving
in
well
then
she
said
okay
and
i
thought
i
detected
some
disappointment
in
her
tone
i
like
you
to
see
it
anyhow
the
key
was
hidden
on
one
of
the
roof
supports
near
the
door
we
went
inside
it
was
bare
but
it
looked
clean
and
comfortable
there
were
fish
rods
on
a
wall
rack
and
a
big
stone
fireplace
it
nice
i
said
i
always
loved
it
i
make
a
wild
row
if
dad
ever
tried
to
sell
it
the
first
time
i
came
up
here
they
had
to
bring
play
pen
and
high
chair
i
learned
to
swim
here
i
broke
my
collarbone
falling
out
of
one
of
those
top
bunks
in
there
she
smiled
at
me
we
were
standing
quite
close
together
there
was
something
both
warm
and
wistful
about
her
smile
there
was
a
long
silence
in
the
room
i
could
hear
birds
and
a
drone
of
an
outboard
motor
our
eyes
locked
once
more
and
her
smile
faded
as
her
mouth
softened
there
was
a
heaviness
about
her
eyes
a
look
almost
of
drowsiness
we
took
a
half
step
toward
each
other
and
she
came
neatly
graciously
into
my
arms
as
though
it
were
an
act
we
had
performed
many
times
the
kiss
was
gentle
at
first
and
then
fierce
and
hungry
as
she
strained
upward
against
me
my
hands
felt
the
long
smoothness
of
her
back
and
her
arm
was
crooked
hard
around
my
neck
we
wavered
in
dizzy
balance
and
i
quickly
to
catch
our
balance
and
we
parted
awkwardly
shy
as
children
tal
she
said
tal
i
her
voice
was
throaty
and
unfocused
i
know
i
said
i
know
she
turned
away
abruptly
and
walked
slowly
to
the
window
and
looked
out
across
the
lake
i
followed
her
and
put
my
hands
lightly
on
her
shoulders
i
felt
shamed
by
all
this
shamed
by
my
lies
and
afraid
of
what
would
happen
when
she
found
out
about
me
i
felt
new
tension
in
her
body
and
she
leaned
closer
to
the
window
and
seemed
to
peer
more
intently
what
the
matter
look
is
that
some
kind
of
animal
over
there
directly
across
that
was
the
warden
camp
before
george
sold
it
the
one
with
the
green
roof
now
look
just
to
the
right
of
the
porch
i
looked
and
saw
something
bulky
partially
screened
by
brush
it
looked
as
if
it
could
be
a
bear
she
brushed
by
me
and
came
back
with
a
pair
of
binoculars
she
focused
them
and
said
it
a
man
here
you
look
i
adjusted
them
to
my
eyes
the
man
was
getting
to
his
feet
he
was
a
big
man
in
a
brown
suit
he
was
hatless
and
his
hair
was
thin
on
top
and
he
had
a
wide
face
it
was
the
man
who
had
driven
by
fitz
and
me
in
the
blue
sedan
the
man
who
had
come
into
the
bar
at
the
inn
he
brushed
the
knees
of
his
brown
suit
and
dusted
his
hands
together
he
bent
over
and
picked
up
what
looked
to
be
a
long
dowel
or
a
piece
of
reinforcing
rod
let
me
look
she
said
and
took
the
binoculars
again
i
know
the
people
who
bought
the
camp
from
george
that
is
the
man
maybe
he
a
service
man
of
some
kind
i
do
think
so
i
know
most
of
them
now
he
going
up
on
the
porch
he
trying
the
door
hey
he
broke
a
window
right
next
to
the
door
now
he
getting
it
up
now
he
stepping
in
over
the
sill
she
turned
to
me
her
eyes
wide
how
about
that
tal
he
a
thief
we
better
go
over
there
anything
you
say
but
how
about
the
law
wait
a
minute
she
hurried
into
the
bedroom
she
came
back
with
a
target
pistol
and
a
box
of
shells
it
was
a
automatic
she
thumbed
the
clip
out
and
loaded
it
expertly
snapped
the
clip
back
in
and
handed
me
the
gun
you
be
more
impressive
with
it
than
i
would
come
on
there
was
no
road
that
led
directly
around
the
lake
we
had
to
go
about
four
miles
out
of
our
way
to
get
to
the
road
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
a
dark
blue
sedan
was
parked
at
the
head
of
the
driveway
facing
out
there
was
room
to
drive
by
i
parked
and
we
went
down
the
trail
toward
the
camp
i
turned
and
motioned
her
to
stay
back
i
went
ahead
but
i
heard
her
right
behind
me
the
man
came
walking
around
the
corner
of
the
camp
frowning
he
stopped
short
when
he
saw
me
his
eyes
flicking
toward
the
gun
and
then
toward
ruth
why
did
you
break
into
that
camp
ruth
demanded
angrily
take
it
easy
lady
put
the
gun
away
friend
answer
the
question
i
said
keeping
the
gun
on
him
he
acted
so
unimpressed
that
i
felt
ridiculous
holding
the
gun
i
a
licensed
private
investigator
friend
do
put
any
hole
in
me
while
i
getting
my
wallet
i
show
you
he
took
the
wallet
out
he
took
out
a
card
encased
in
plastic
and
nipped
it
toward
us
ruth
picked
it
up
it
had
his
picture
and
a
thumb
print
and
two
official
looking
countersignatures
and
it
said
he
was
licensed
by
the
state
of
illinois
his
name
was
milton
grassman
the
card
said
he
was
years
old
six
foot
one
and
weighed
two
hundred
and
five
but
what
are
you
investigating
ruth
asked
he
smiled
just
investigating
and
who
are
you
lady
maybe
trespassing
his
smile
was
half
good
humor
half
contempt
you
working
for
rose
fulton
are
you
i
asked
the
smile
was
gone
instantly
he
did
seem
to
move
or
breathe
i
had
the
impression
that
a
very
good
mind
behind
that
flat
tough
face
was
working
rapidly
i
afraid
i
do
know
the
name
he
said
but
he
had
waited
too
long
who
are
you
friend
we
going
to
report
this
to
the
police
ruth
said
go
ahead
lady
be
a
good
citizen
give
them
the
word
come
on
tal
she
said
we
went
back
up
the
trail
when
we
got
into
the
car
i
looked
back
and
saw
him
standing
by
his
car
watching
us
he
did
take
his
eyes
off
us
while
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
shook
the
match
out
ruth
was
oddly
silent
as
i
drove
back
toward
the
stamm
camp
finally
i
said
what
the
matter
i
do
know
at
first
i
thought
you
lied
to
me
then
i
believed
you
now
i
do
know
how
come
you
know
what
i
thinking
you
asked
him
about
a
rose
fulton
it
shocked
him
when
you
asked
him
that
anybody
could
see
that
eloise
warden
ran
away
with
a
man
named
fulton
what
would
make
you
think
to
ask
that
grassman
that
question
she
turned
to
face
me
what
are
you
doing
in
hillston
tal
if
that
your
name
i
told
you
what
i
doing
why
did
you
ask
that
man
that
question
the
police
picked
me
up
last
night
they
had
word
that
rose
fulton
had
hired
another
man
to
come
here
this
will
be
the
third
they
thought
i
was
that
man
they
interrogated
me
and
then
they
let
me
go
so
i
guessed
that
maybe
he
was
the
man
we
got
out
of
the
car
she
was
still
looking
at
me
oddly
tal
if
you
here
to
write
up
timmy
i
think
you
would
have
told
me
that
before
now
it
a
cute
and
interesting
little
story
if
you
were
here
just
to
write
up
timmy
and
i
ca
believe
that
you
could
have
forgotten
it
i
just
did
think
of
telling
it
that
no
good
tal
i
know
it
is
what
wrong
is
it
something
you
ca
tell
me
look
ruth
i
there
is
another
reason
why
i
came
i
lied
to
you
i
do
want
to
tell
you
why
i
came
here
i
rather
not
but
it
has
something
to
do
with
timmy
that
right
he
is
dead
is
he
he
dead
but
how
can
i
know
when
you
lying
and
when
you
not
i
guess
you
ca
i
said
helplessly
she
locked
the
camp
and
on
the
way
back
told
me
which
turns
to
take
she
had
nothing
else
to
say
i
drove
into
her
place
she
opened
the
door
quickly
to
get
out
wait
a
minute
ruth
her
right
foot
was
on
the
ground
she
sat
on
the
corner
of
the
seat
and
turned
and
looked
back
at
me
yes
i
sorry
about
this
you
made
me
feel
like
a
fool
i
talked
a
lot
to
you
i
believed
you
and
so
i
told
you
things
i
never
told
anybody
just
to
help
you
when
you
had
no
intention
of
writing
up
timmy
i
tell
you
i
sorry
that
does
do
very
much
good
but
i
give
you
this
much
benefit
of
the
doubt
tal
look
right
at
me
and
tell
me
that
you
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
why
you
came
here
i
looked
into
the
gray
eyes
and
like
grassman
i
hesitated
too
long
she
slammed
the
car
door
and
went
to
the
house
without
looking
back
saturday
night
was
no
longer
a
nice
thing
to
think
about
somehow
through
impulsiveness
and
through
awkwardness
i
had
trapped
myself
i
felt
as
if
i
had
lost
a
great
deal
more
than
a
saturday
night
date
she
was
not
a
girl
you
could
lie
to
she
was
not
a
girl
you
would
want
to
lie
to
my
little
cover
story
now
seemed
soiled
and
dingy
i
drove
into
town
i
started
my
drinking
at
the
hillston
inn
before
i
left
the
inn
i
cashed
two
traveler
checks
i
hit
a
great
many
bars
it
was
saturday
night
the
city
seemed
alive
i
can
remember
seeing
the
dwarf
bartender
there
was
a
woman
i
bought
drinks
for
at
one
time
i
was
in
a
men
room
and
four
of
us
were
singing
the
door
was
locked
and
somebody
was
pounding
on
it
we
were
making
fine
music
i
was
sick
in
a
hedge
and
i
could
find
my
car
i
wandered
a
long
time
before
i
found
it
i
do
know
what
time
it
was
it
was
late
i
had
to
keep
one
eye
closed
as
i
drove
cautiously
out
to
the
motel
otherwise
the
center
line
was
double
i
parked
the
car
in
front
of
my
motel
room
and
went
unwashed
to
bed
sunday
was
a
replica
a
sodden
day
in
town
a
drunken
day
it
was
eleven
when
i
got
up
on
monday
morning
a
half
dozen
glasses
of
water
made
me
feel
bloated
but
did
quench
my
thirst
my
head
pounded
in
a
dull
ragged
rhythm
i
shaved
slowly
painfully
the
shower
made
me
feel
a
little
better
i
decided
that
it
was
time
to
go
time
to
leave
this
place
i
did
know
where
i
would
head
for
any
place
any
kind
of
a
job
some
kind
of
manual
labor
get
too
bushed
to
think
i
packed
my
two
bags
i
left
them
inside
the
door
and
went
out
to
unlock
the
trunk
all
the
transient
cars
were
gone
a
big
dog
stood
with
his
feet
against
the
side
of
my
car
looking
in
the
side
window
the
cold
thin
birdlike
woman
was
carrying
sheets
and
towels
out
of
one
of
the
other
rooms
and
dumping
them
into
a
hamper
on
wheels
the
dog
jumped
back
as
i
walked
out
he
stood
twenty
feet
away
and
whined
in
a
funny
way
i
made
as
though
to
throw
gravel
at
him
and
he
went
farther
back
i
did
know
what
attracted
him
to
my
car
i
happened
to
glance
inside
as
i
was
heading
to
unlock
the
trunk
i
stopped
and
looked
for
a
long
time
it
seemed
an
effort
to
take
my
eyes
away
a
big
body
was
on
the
floor
in
the
back
legs
bent
head
tilted
sideways
it
was
milton
grassman
he
still
wore
the
brown
suit
the
knees
showed
traces
of
pale
dried
mud
the
forehead
in
the
area
where
the
thin
hairline
had
started
was
broken
jelly
an
ugly
sickening
depression
no
man
could
have
lived
more
than
a
moment
with
a
wound
like
that
i
realized
the
woman
was
calling
to
me
in
her
thin
voice
i
turned
and
said
what
i
said
are
you
staying
another
day
yes
yes
i
staying
another
day
she
went
into
another
room
she
was
working
her
way
toward
mine
i
hurried
back
in
i
put
one
bag
in
the
closet
opened
the
other
one
put
my
toilet
articles
back
in
the
bathroom
i
slammed
the
door
and
went
out
the
dog
was
standing
by
the
car
again
whining
i
got
behind
the
wheel
and
drove
out
of
there
i
drove
away
from
town
i
did
want
to
be
stopped
by
a
traffic
light
where
anybody
could
look
down
into
the
back
of
the
car
i
remembered
an
old
tarp
in
the
back
i
pulled
off
onto
the
shoulder
and
got
the
tarp
i
waited
while
traffic
went
by
and
then
spread
the
tarp
over
grassman
i
tried
not
to
look
at
him
while
i
did
it
but
i
could
help
seeing
his
face
the
slackness
of
death
had
ironed
everything
out
of
it
all
expression
i
drove
on
aimlessly
and
then
stormed
again
on
the
shoulder
of
the
highway
i
wanted
to
be
able
to
think
i
could
feel
the
dreadful
presence
of
the
body
behind
me
my
brain
felt
frozen
numbed
useless
it
did
no
good
to
wonder
when
the
body
had
been
put
there
i
even
remember
the
places
where
i
had
parked
why
had
it
been
put
in
my
car
somebody
wanted
to
get
rid
of
it
somebody
wanted
to
divert
suspicion
from
himself
from
the
look
of
the
wound
murder
had
been
violent
and
unplanned
one
tremendous
blow
it
was
inevitable
that
i
should
begin
to
think
of
fitz
of
the
people
i
knew
in
hillston
he
was
the
one
capable
of
murder
and
both
quick
and
brutal
enough
to
have
killed
a
man
like
grassman
from
what
i
had
seen
of
him
grassman
looked
tough
and
capable
but
why
would
fitz
want
to
implicate
me
the
answer
was
quick
and
chilling
it
meant
that
he
had
traced
the
right
cindy
the
cindy
who
would
know
where
timmy
had
buried
the
money
he
might
already
have
the
money
the
immediate
problem
was
to
get
rid
of
the
body
it
should
be
a
place
where
there
would
be
no
witness
no
one
to
remember
having
seen
my
car
i
could
go
to
the
police
i
was
here
before
unemployed
no
permanent
address
a
criminal
record
according
to
your
definition
it
so
happens
i
have
a
body
in
my
car
it
got
in
there
somehow
last
night
was
i
drunk
brother
you
can
find
a
dozen
witnesses
to
how
drunk
i
was
i
was
a
slobbering
mess
the
worst
i
ever
been
in
my
life
worse
even
than
the
night
before
there
would
be
no
glimmer
of
understanding
in
the
cold
official
eyes
of
lieutenant
prine
a
state
road
patrol
car
passed
me
going
slowly
the
trooper
behind
the
wheel
stared
curiously
at
me
as
i
sat
there
he
stopped
and
backed
up
maybe
they
were
already
looking
for
me
he
leaned
across
the
empty
seat
and
said
what
the
trouble
nothing
i
mean
i
was
overheating
i
thought
i
let
it
cool
off
is
it
far
to
a
gas
station
mile
or
so
it
cool
off
quicker
if
you
open
the
hood
will
it
thanks
and
get
it
a
little
farther
off
the
road
doc
he
went
on
i
moved
the
car
farther
off
the
road
i
opened
the
hood
i
wondered
if
he
would
be
bothered
by
the
way
i
had
acted
and
come
back
to
check
my
license
and
look
the
car
over
i
wondered
if
i
should
make
a
and
get
as
far
away
from
him
as
i
could
but
it
made
some
sense
to
risk
the
outside
chance
of
his
coming
back
and
stay
right
there
until
i
could
plan
what
to
do
with
the
body
the
noon
sun
was
warm
there
was
a
subtle
sour
odor
in
the
car
that
sickened
me
a
tractor
moved
back
and
forth
across
a
distant
hillside
drainage
water
bubbled
in
the
ditch
beside
the
shoulder
a
truck
went
by
at
high
speed
the
blast
of
its
passage
shaking
my
car
i
found
that
a
drunk
gives
your
mind
a
flavor
of
unreliability
memory
is
shaky
and
dreams
become
mixed
with
reality
i
began
to
wonder
if
i
had
imagined
the
body
when
there
was
no
traffic
i
looked
into
the
back
seat
again
the
tarp
was
there
the
body
was
covered
it
was
not
covered
very
well
i
saw
a
thick
ankle
a
dark
green
sock
a
brown
scuffed
shoe
cracked
across
the
instep
with
laces
tied
in
a
double
knot
the
way
my
mother
used
to
tie
my
shoelaces
when
i
was
very
small
to
keep
them
from
coming
untied
it
made
grassman
more
believable
as
a
person
as
the
person
who
had
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
bed
and
tied
those
laces
and
then
had
gone
out
and
become
a
body
and
the
laces
would
eventually
be
untied
by
somebody
else
somebody
with
a
professional
coolness
and
an
unthinking
competence
i
whirled
around
when
i
heard
traffic
coming
when
the
road
was
clear
again
i
pulled
the
tarp
to
cover
the
ankle
and
shoe
but
it
pulled
clear
of
his
head
and
my
stomach
spasmed
and
i
could
not
look
at
him
after
a
while
i
fixed
the
tarp
properly
i
got
out
of
the
car
i
did
not
want
to
look
in
again
but
i
found
myself
staring
in
at
the
side
window
i
had
to
get
rid
of
it
somewhere
i
had
to
get
rid
of
it
soon
the
very
nearness
of
the
body
kept
me
from
thinking
clearly
the
lake
i
could
find
it
again
but
i
could
be
seen
there
as
readily
as
ruth
saw
grassman
i
could
hunt
for
obscure
roads
at
random
and
dump
the
body
out
when
i
came
to
what
seemed
to
be
a
good
place
but
the
body
was
going
to
be
found
and
it
was
going
to
be
identified
and
it
was
going
to
be
in
the
paper
with
the
right
name
and
ruth
was
going
to
remember
the
odd
question
i
had
asked
the
man
and
remember
his
telltale
response
to
that
question
the
minutes
were
ticking
by
and
i
was
getting
nowhere
trap
was
wide
and
deep
lined
with
sharp
stakes
i
wished
i
could
put
the
body
back
on
his
doorstep
give
it
right
back
to
him
let
him
sweat
at
first
glance
the
idea
seemed
absurd
but
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
better
it
seemed
i
would
be
seen
driving
into
the
yard
but
if
questioned
i
could
say
that
i
was
going
to
see
fitzmartin
and
i
would
see
fitzmartin
i
would
leave
the
body
in
the
yard
somewhere
between
the
piles
of
stacked
lumber
no
that
would
do
no
good
no
man
would
be
so
stupid
as
to
kill
another
man
and
leave
the
body
at
the
place
where
he
worked
yet
if
some
attempt
was
made
to
conceal
the
body
perhaps
then
they
would
assume
it
was
a
temporary
hiding
place
until
fitzmartin
could
think
of
another
on
the
other
hand
would
any
man
be
so
stupid
as
to
kill
another
man
and
then
drive
the
body
to
the
police
station
in
his
car
and
claim
he
did
do
it
maybe
that
was
my
best
out
maybe
that
was
the
best
innocent
reaction
my
hands
were
icy
cold
and
sweaty
they
left
wet
marks
where
i
touched
the
steering
wheel
i
was
trying
to
think
of
every
alternative
every
possible
plan
of
action
i
could
go
back
and
check
out
and
head
west
and
try
to
leave
the
body
where
it
would
never
be
found
buy
a
shovel
dig
a
desert
grave
i
could
put
the
body
in
the
seat
beside
me
and
run
into
something
my
ideas
were
getting
worse
instead
of
better
the
very
presence
of
the
body
made
thinking
as
laborious
as
trying
to
run
through
water
i
did
not
want
to
panic
but
i
knew
i
had
to
get
rid
of
it
as
soon
as
possible
and
i
could
not
see
myself
going
to
prine
for
tender
mercy
there
had
been
a
reason
why
grassman
had
been
killed
hiding
the
body
would
give
me
a
grace
period
i
would
have
to
assume
it
would
be
traced
to
me
eventually
by
the
time
they
caught
up
with
me
i
would
have
to
know
why
he
had
been
killed
knowing
why
would
mean
knowing
who
i
knew
it
was
fitz
why
did
fitz
kill
grassman
i
shut
the
hood
and
started
the
car
and
drove
i
was
five
miles
from
the
court
and
about
nine
miles
from
town
when
i
found
a
promising
looking
road
that
turned
left
it
was
potholed
asphalt
ravaged
by
winter
torn
by
tractor
lugs
it
climbed
mild
hills
and
dipped
into
forgotten
valleys
it
came
out
of
a
heavy
wooded
area
and
ahead
on
the
left
set
well
back
from
the
road
i
saw
a
tall
stone
chimney
where
a
house
had
burned
long
ago
the
weathered
gray
barn
had
half
collapsed
it
looked
like
a
great
gray
animal
with
a
broken
back
its
hind
legs
dragging
the
road
was
empty
i
turned
in
where
the
farm
road
had
once
been
small
trees
bent
over
under
my
front
bumper
dragged
along
the
underside
of
the
car
and
half
rose
again
behind
me
i
circled
the
foundation
of
the
house
and
parked
behind
the
barn
near
a
wild
tangle
of
berry
bushes
i
could
not
be
seen
from
the
road
i
had
to
risk
being
seen
from
distant
hillsides
it
seemed
very
quiet
with
the
motor
off
a
crow
went
over
hoarse
and
derisive
i
opened
the
rear
door
of
the
car
i
made
myself
grasp
his
heavy
ankles
rigor
had
begun
to
set
in
it
took
all
my
strength
to
pull
the
bulky
body
free
of
the
cramped
space
between
the
back
seat
and
the
back
of
the
front
seat
it
came
free
suddenly
thudding
to
the
ground
i
released
the
ankles
and
staggered
back
there
had
been
something
under
the
body
friction
had
pulled
it
toward
me
it
rested
on
the
car
floor
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
car
a
short
bright
length
of
galvanized
pipe
with
a
dark
brown
smear
at
one
end
i
left
the
body
there
and
went
to
see
where
i
would
put
it
there
was
a
great
splintered
hole
in
the
back
of
the
barn
i
stepped
up
and
through
the
hole
the
floor
felt
solid
daylight
came
brightly
through
the
holes
in
the
roof
i
went
back
to
the
body
again
it
was
not
hard
to
drag
it
to
the
hole
but
getting
it
inside
the
barn
was
difficult
i
had
to
lift
it
about
three
feet
i
puzzled
over
how
to
do
it
finally
i
turned
him
around
and
propped
him
up
in
a
sitting
position
his
back
to
the
hole
i
climbed
up
over
him
then
reached
down
and
got
his
wrists
i
pulled
him
up
over
the
edge
and
then
dragged
him
back
into
the
darkness
there
was
some
hay
on
the
floor
musty
and
matted
i
covered
the
body
with
it
i
went
out
and
got
the
piece
of
pipe
using
a
dry
leaf
to
pick
it
up
i
dropped
it
into
the
hay
that
covered
the
body
i
went
back
out
into
the
sunlight
i
wondered
about
grassman
i
wondered
what
compulsion
had
made
him
choose
his
line
of
work
dirty
monotonous
and
sometimes
dangerous
work
from
the
look
of
the
man
as
he
talked
to
us
up
at
the
lake
i
guessed
that
he
had
no
idea
it
would
end
like
this
he
had
looked
tough
and
confident
this
body
under
the
straw
was
a
far
cry
from
the
fictional
private
eyes
the
smart
ones
and
the
suave
ones
and
the
gamy
ones
his
story
had
ended
he
would
not
sit
up
brush
the
straw
out
of
his
eyes
and
reach
for
either
blonde
or
bottle
leaving
him
there
had
about
it
the
faint
flavor
of
burial
as
though
solemn
words
should
be
said
i
inspected
the
car
the
floor
rug
was
stained
and
spotted
in
four
places
i
could
see
any
on
the
seat
or
on
the
insides
of
the
doors
i
took
the
floor
rug
out
and
rolled
it
up
i
put
it
beside
me
in
the
front
seat
i
sat
and
listened
to
the
quietness
straining
to
hear
any
sound
of
car
motor
laboring
on
the
hills
i
heard
only
the
birds
and
the
sound
of
wind
i
drove
back
out
and
i
did
not
head
back
the
way
i
had
come
a
car
seen
going
and
returning
was
more
likely
to
be
remembered
on
a
country
road
than
a
car
that
went
on
through
in
about
three
miles
i
came
to
a
crossroads
i
turned
north
i
thought
the
road
was
paralleling
the
main
highway
but
in
five
miles
it
joined
the
main
highway
coming
into
it
at
a
shallow
angle
i
took
the
next
secondary
road
that
turned
right
i
was
closer
to
the
city
soon
as
i
had
hoped
and
expected
i
came
to
a
place
where
a
lot
of
trash
had
been
dumped
i
put
the
rolled
rug
in
with
the
bed
springs
and
broken
scooters
and
kicked
some
cans
over
it
by
the
time
i
passed
the
motel
heading
toward
the
city
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
only
quarter
after
one
i
ate
at
a
small
restaurant
on
delaware
street
when
i
left
i
met
pat
rorick
on
the
sidewalk
she
had
an
armful
of
bundles
she
smiled
and
said
hello
mr
howard
did
you
remember
anything
mrs
rorick
i
do
know
if
this
is
any
use
to
you
but
i
did
remember
one
little
thing
it
was
a
skit
the
eighth
grade
did
and
timmy
was
in
it
it
was
based
on
cinderella
i
ca
remember
the
girl
who
played
the
part
but
i
remember
how
funny
it
sounded
the
way
it
was
written
with
timmy
calling
the
girl
cindy
it
probably
does
mean
anything
it
might
thanks
i
glad
i
met
you
i
was
wondering
whether
to
call
you
about
anything
that
sounds
so
stupid
i
got
to
run
there
comes
my
bus
i
drive
you
home
no
do
bother
i
convinced
her
i
had
nothing
to
do
we
got
into
the
car
she
had
her
packages
piled
on
her
lap
i
wondered
how
she
feel
if
she
known
about
my
last
passenger
how
should
i
go
about
finding
out
who
that
girl
was
gee
i
do
know
it
was
a
long
time
ago
i
do
know
if
anybody
would
remember
the
teacher
was
miss
major
i
had
her
too
later
she
was
real
cute
i
think
she
wrote
that
skit
they
did
i
do
know
what
happened
to
her
i
think
she
got
married
and
moved
away
they
might
know
at
the
school
it
john
davis
school
on
holly
street
near
the
bridge
seven
the
john
davis
school
was
an
ancient
building
with
an
iron
picket
fence
enclosing
the
schoolyard
as
i
went
up
the
steps
to
the
door
i
could
hear
a
class
of
small
voices
chanting
something
in
unison
it
was
a
sleepy
nostalgic
afternoon
sound
in
the
wide
wooden
hallway
there
were
drinking
fountains
which
looked
absurdly
low
a
small
boy
came
down
the
hall
tapping
himself
gently
and
wistfully
on
the
head
with
a
ruler
he
gave
me
an
opaque
stare
and
continued
on
his
way
there
was
a
nervous
young
woman
in
the
outer
office
of
the
office
she
was
typing
and
chewing
her
lip
and
when
she
looked
up
at
me
she
was
obviously
irritated
by
the
interruption
i
trying
to
find
a
miss
major
who
used
to
teach
here
she
taught
subjects
i
believe
we
only
go
through
the
sixth
then
the
children
go
to
the
junior
high
i
know
that
but
you
used
to
have
the
seventh
and
eighth
here
not
for
a
long
time
not
since
i
been
here
are
there
any
records

there
any
place
you
could
look
i
would
know
where
to
look
i
would
know
anything
like
that
are
there
any
teachers
here
who
would
have
been
here
when
miss
major
was
here
i
guess
there
probably
are
i
guess
there
would
be
some
how
long
ago
was
she
here
about
twelve
years
ago
stearns
has
been
teaching
here
years
third
grade
room
sixteen
that
on
this
floor
just
around
the
corner
i
would
want
to
interrupt
a
class
any
minute
now
they
all
be
going
home
then
you
could
ask
her
i
would
know
anything
like
that
i
would
know
where
to
look
or
anything
i
waited
outside
room
sixteen
there
was
a
lull
and
then
somebody
started
a
record
player
sousa
filled
the
halls
with
brass
at
peak
volume
there
was
a
great
scurrying
in
all
the
rooms
the
doors
opened
all
the
small
denizens
marched
into
the
hall
and
stood
in
impatient
ragged
double
lines
stomping
their
feet
in
time
to
the
music
the
floor
shook
weary
teachers
kept
a
cautious
eye
on
the
lines
the
upstairs
rooms
marched
down
the
stairs
and
out
the
double
doors
then
the
main
floor
marched
out
yelling
as
soon
as
they
hit
the
sunlight
the
school
was
emptied
sousa
blared
on
for
a
few
moments
and
died
in
the
middle
of
a
bar
mrs
stearns
yes
i
mrs
stearns
she
was
a
round
pale
woman
with
hair
like
steel
wool
and
small
sharp
bright
dark
eyes
my
name
is
howard
talbert
howard
did
you
know
a
miss
major
who
used
to
teach
here
of
course
i
knew
katherine
very
well
that
reminds
me
i
should
stop
by
and
see
how
she
getting
along
these
days
she
in
town
oh
yes
the
poor
thing
is
she
ill
oh
i
thought
you
knew
katherine
went
blind
quite
suddenly
about
ten
years
ago
it
was
a
shock
to
all
of
us
i
feel
guilty
that
i
do
call
on
her
more
often
but
after
a
full
day
of
the
children
i
do
feel
like
calling
on
anyone
i
do
seem
to
have
the
energy
any
more
could
you
tell
me
where
she
lives
not
off
hand
but
it
in
the
phone
book
she
on
finch
avenue
in
an
apartment
i
know
the
house
but
i
ca
remember
the
number
she
lives
alone
she
very
proud
you
know
and
she
really
gets
along
remarkably
well
considering
it
was
a
small
apartment
in
the
rear
of
an
old
house
music
was
playing
loudly
in
the
apartment
it
was
a
symphony
i
recognize
the
music
stopped
moments
after
i
knocked
at
the
door
miss
major
opened
the
door
she
wore
a
blue
dress
her
hair
was
white
and
worn
in
a
long
page
boy
her
features
were
strong
she
could
have
once
been
a
beautiful
woman
she
was
still
handsome
when
i
spoke
to
her
she
seemed
to
focus
on
my
face
it
was
hard
to
believe
those
eyes
were
sightless
i
told
her
my
name
and
said
i
wanted
to
ask
her
about
a
student
she
had
had
in
the
eighth
grade
please
come
in
howard
sit
there
in
the
red
chair
i
was
having
tea
would
you
care
for
some
no
thank
you
then
one
of
these
cookies
a
friend
of
mine
bakes
them
they
very
good
she
held
the
plate
in
precisely
the
right
spot
i
took
one
and
thanked
her
she
put
the
plate
back
on
the
table
and
sat
facing
me
she
found
her
teacup
and
lifted
it
to
her
lips
now
what
student
was
it
do
you
remember
timmy
warden
of
course
i
remember
him
he
was
a
charmer
i
was
told
how
he
died
i
was
dreadfully
sorry
to
hear
it
a
man
came
to
see
me
six
or
seven
months
ago
he
said
he
been
in
that
prison
camp
with
timmy
i
never
could
quite
understand
why
he
came
to
see
me
his
name
was
fitzmartin
and
he
asked
all
sorts
of
odd
questions
i
could
feel
at
ease
with
him
he
did
seem
quite
right
if
you
know
what
i
mean
when
you
lose
one
sense
you
seem
to
become
more
aware
of
nuances
i
was
in
that
camp
too
miss
major
oh
i
so
sorry
probably
fitzmartin
is
a
friend
of
yours
no
he
not
that
a
relief
now
do
tell
me
you
came
here
to
ask
odd
questions
too
mr
howard
fairly
odd
i
guess
in
camp
timmy
spoke
about
a
girl
named
cindy
i
been
trying
to
track
her
down
for
personal
reasons
one
of
your
other
students
cindy
kirschner
told
me
that
you
wrote
a
skit
based
on
cinderella
for
the
eighth
grade
when
you
had
timmy
in
the
class
timmy
was
very
well
when
he
mentioned
this
cindy
i
wondering
if
he
could
have
meant
the
girl
who
played
the
part
in
the
play
whatever
has
happened
to
cindy
kirschner
howard
such
a
shy
sweet
child
and
those
dreadful
teeth
the
teeth
have
been
fixed
she
married
to
a
man
named
pat
rorick
and
she
has
a
couple
of
kids
that
good
to
hear
the
other
children
used
to
be
horrible
to
her
they
can
be
little
animals
at
times
do
you
remember
who
played
the
part
of
cindy
in
the
skit
of
course
i
remember
i
remember
because
it
was
sort
of
an
experiment
her
name
was
antoinette
rasi
wait
a
moment
i
show
you
something
she
went
into
the
other
room
she
was
gone
nearly
five
minutes
she
came
back
with
a
glossy
photograph
i
had
a
friend
help
me
sort
these
out
after
i
learned
braille
marked
them
all
so
i
know
this
is
the
right
one
it
a
graduation
picture
i
kept
the
graduation
pictures
of
all
my
classes
though
what
use
i
have
for
pictures
i
never
know
she
handed
it
to
me
and
said
i
believe
antoinette
is
in
the
back
row
toward
the
left
look
for
a
girl
with
a
great
mass
of
black
hair
and
a
pretty
rather
sullen
face
i
do
imagine
she
was
smiling
i
think
i
found
her
antoinette
was
a
problem
she
was
a
little
older
than
the
others
half
french
and
half
italian
she
resented
discipline
she
was
a
rowdy
a
troublemaker
but
i
liked
the
child
and
i
thought
i
understood
her
her
people
were
very
poor
and
i
do
think
she
got
much
attention
at
home
she
had
an
older
brother
who
had
been
in
trouble
with
the
police
and
i
believe
an
older
sister
she
came
to
school
inadequately
dressed
when
the
weather
was
cold
she
had
a
lot
of
spirit
she
was
a
very
alive
person
i
think
she
was
sensitive
but
she
hid
it
very
carefully
i
ca
help
but
wonder
sometimes
what
has
happened
to
the
child
the
rasis
lived
north
of
the
city
where
the
river
widens
out
i
believe
that
rasi
had
a
boat
and
bait
business
in
the
summer
and
did
odd
jobs
in
the
wintertime
their
house
was
a
shack
i
went
out
there
once
after
antoinette
had
missed
a
whole
week
of
school
i
found
she
had
come
because
she
had
a
black
eye
her
brother
gave
it
to
her
i
gave
her
the
part
of
cinderella
in
an
attempt
to
get
her
to
take
more
interest
in
class
activities
i
afraid
it
was
a
mistake
i
believe
she
thought
it
was
a
reflection
on
the
way
she
lived
was
timmy
friendly
with
her
quite
friendly
i
sometimes
wondered
if
that
was
a
good
thing
she
seemed
quite
precocious
in
some
departments
and
timmy
was
a
very
sweet
boy
he
could
have
called
her
cindy
because
of
the
skit
i
imagine
so
children
dote
on
nicknames
i
remember
one
poor
little
boy
with
a
sinus
condition
the
other
children
made
him
unhappy
by
calling
him
rumblehead
i
want
to
thank
you
for
your
help
miss
major
i
hope
the
information
is
of
some
use
to
you
when
you
find
antoinette
tell
her
i
asked
about
her
i
do
that
she
went
with
me
to
the
door
she
said
they
bringing
me
a
new
braille
student
at
four
he
seems
to
be
a
little
late
howard
are
you
in
some
kind
of
trouble
the
abrupt
startled
me
trouble
yes
i
in
trouble
bad
trouble
i
wo
give
you
any
lecture
howard
i
been
given
too
much
of
that
myself
i
was
just
checking
my
own
reactions
i
sensed
trouble
an
aura
of
worry
as
with
that
fitzmartin
i
detected
an
aura
of
directed
evil
when
i
got
out
in
front
a
woman
was
helping
a
young
boy
out
of
a
car
the
boy
wore
dark
glasses
his
mouth
had
an
look
and
i
heard
the
whine
in
his
voice
as
he
complained
about
something
to
her
i
felt
that
i
had
discovered
cindy
there
had
been
a
hint
as
to
what
she
was
like
in
the
very
tone
of
timmy
voice
weak
as
he
was
there
had
been
a
note
of
fond
appreciation
the
echo
of
lust
cindy
would
know
the
phrasing
was
odd
not
would
it
would
be
a
place
known
to
her
i
sat
in
my
car
for
a
few
moments
i
did
not
know
how
long
my
period
of
grace
would
last
i
did
not
know
whether
i
should
continue
in
search
of
the
elusive
cindy
or
try
to
make
sense
of
the
relationship
between
fitz
and
grassman
it
came
to
me
that
i
had
been
a
fool
not
to
search
the
body
there
might
have
been
notes
papers
letters
reports
something
to
indicate
why
he
had
been
slain
yet
i
knew
i
could
not
risk
going
back
there
and
it
was
doubtful
that
the
murderer
would
have
been
so
clumsy
as
to
leave
anything
indirectly
incriminating
on
the
body
itself
i
did
not
know
where
to
start
i
did
think
anything
could
be
gained
by
going
to
fitzmartin
facing
him
he
certainly
would
answer
no
questions
why
had
it
been
necessary
to
kill
grassman
either
it
was
related
to
grassman
job
or
it
was
something
apart
from
it
grassman
job
had
apparently
been
due
to
rose
fulton
conviction
that
her
husband
had
come
to
some
harm
here
in
hillston
prine
investigation
had
evidently
been
thorough
he
was
satisfied
that
fulton
and
eloise
warden
had
run
off
together
he
had
a
witness
to
the
actual
departure
yet
grassman
had
been
poking
around
the
cabin
the
wardens
used
to
own
i
could
not
imagine
what
he
hoped
to
gain
i
could
not
help
but
believe
that
grassman
death
was
in
some
way
related
to
the
sixty
thousand
dollars
i
wondered
if
grassman
had
somehow
acquired
the
information
that
a
sizable
sum
had
disappeared
from
the
warden
business
ventures
over
a
period
of
time
and
had
added
two
and
two
together
or
if
in
looking
for
fulton
body
he
had
stumbled
across
the
money
maybe
at
the
same
time
fitz
was
looking
for
it
many
murders
have
been
committed
for
one
tenth
that
amount
there
was
only
one
starting
place
with
grassman
that
was
rose
fulton
maybe
grassman
had
sent
her
reports
she
was
probably
a
resident
of
illinois
i
wondered
who
would
know
her
address
it
would
have
to
be
someone
whose
suspicions
would
not
be
aroused
i
wondered
if
there
was
any
way
of
finding
out
without
asking
anyone
if
the
police
investigation
had
been
reported
in
the
local
paper
fulton
home
town
would
probably
have
been
given
but
not
his
street
address
i
realized
that
i
did
not
dare
make
any
effort
to
get
hold
of
fulton
it
would
link
me
too
closely
to
grassman
antoinette
rasi
then
i
would
look
for
her
the
shack
was
on
the
riverbank
it
had
a
sagging
porch
auto
parts
stamped
into
the
mud
of
the
yard
dingy
monday
washing
flapping
on
a
knotted
line
a
disconsolate
tire
hanging
from
a
tree
limb
and
a
shiny
new
television
aerial
a
thin
dark
boy
of
about
twelve
was
carefully
painting
an
overturned
boat
doing
a
good
job
of
it
a
little
girl
was
trying
to
harness
a
fat
humble
dog
to
a
broken
cart
a
toddler
in
diapers
watched
her
some
chickens
were
scratching
the
loose
dirt
under
the
porch
the
children
looked
at
me
as
i
got
out
of
the
car
a
heavy
woman
came
to
the
door
she
bulged
with
pregnancy
her
eyes
and
expression
were
unfriendly
the
small
girl
began
to
cry
i
heard
her
brother
hiss
at
her
to
shut
up
the
woman
in
the
doorway
could
have
once
been
quite
pretty
she
was
any
more
it
was
hard
to
guess
how
old
she
might
be
is
your
name
rasi
i
asked
it
was
once
now
it
doyle
what
do
you
want
i
trying
to
locate
antoinette
rasi
for
god
sake
shut
up
sniveling
jeanie
this
man
is
come
to
take
the
teevee
she
smiled
apologetically
at
me
they
took
it
away
once
and
to
jeanie
any
stranger
comes
after
the
same
thing
every
night
the
kids
watch
it
no
homework
no
nothing
just
sit
and
look
it
drives
me
nuts
what
do
you
want
antoinette
for
i
got
a
message
for
her
from
a
friend
the
woman
sniffed
she
makes
a
lot
of
friends
i
guess
she
hang
around
here
any
more
she
up
in
redding
i
do
hear
from
her
any
more
she
never
gets
down
god
knows
i
never
get
up
there
the
old
man
is
dead
and
jack
is
in
the
federal
can
in
atlanta
and
doyle
stand
the
sight
of
her
so
why
should
she
bother
coming
down
here
hell
i
only
her
only
sister
she
sends
money
for
the
kids
but
no
messages
no
nothing
what
does
she
do
she
gave
me
a
wise
wet
smile
she
goes
around
making
friends
i
guess
how
do
i
get
in
touch
with
her
cruise
around
try
the
aztec
and
the
cub
room
and
try
the
doubloon
too
i
heard
her
mention
that
you
can
probably
find
her
it
was
sixty
miles
to
redding
and
dark
when
i
got
there
it
was
twice
the
size
of
hillston
it
was
a
town
with
a
lot
of
neon
lime
and
pink
dark
inviting
blue
lots
of
uniforms
on
the
night
streets
lots
of
girls
on
the
dark
streets
lots
of
cars
going
nowhere
too
fast
horns
blowing
bermuda
bells
ringing
tires
wailing
i
asked
where
the
aztec
and
the
cub
room
and
the
doubloon
were
i
was
directed
to
a
wide
highway
on
the
west
edge
of
town
called
inevitably
the
strip
there
the
neon
really
blossomed
there
was
as
much
sidewalk
traffic
but
for
a
monday
night
there
were
enough
cars
in
the
lots
enough
rough
music
in
the
air
enough
places
to
lose
your
money
or
spend
it
or
have
it
taken
away
from
you
i
went
to
the
aztec
and
i
went
to
the
cub
room
and
i
went
to
the
doubloon
in
each
place
i
asked
a
bartender
about
antoinette
rasi
on
each
occasion
i
received
a
blank
stare
and
a
shrug
and
a
never
heard
of
her
girl
that
unusual
sorry
buster
the
cadence
of
the
evening
was
beginning
to
quicken
all
three
places
were
glamorous
they
were
like
the
lounges
of
the
hotels
along
collins
avenue
on
miami
beach
and
like
the
bistros
of
beverly
hills
the
lighting
was
carefully
contrived
there
was
a
las
vegas
tension
in
those
three
places
a
smell
of
money
here
the
games
were
hidden
but
not
hard
to
find
the
way
doyle
had
spoken
of
her
sister
gave
me
reason
to
believe
i
could
get
assistance
from
the
police
they
were
in
a
brand
new
building
the
sergeant
looked
uncomfortable
behind
a
long
curve
of
stainless
steel
i
told
him
what
doyle
had
said
about
how
to
find
her
there
ought
to
be
something
on
her
let
me
check
it
out
wait
a
couple
minutes
he
got
on
the
phone
he

but
she
had
been
in
i
had
a
steak
sandwich
in
the
doubloon
a
girl
alone
at
the
bar
made
a
determined
effort
to
pick
me
up
she
dug
through
her
purse
looking
for
matches
unlit
cigarette
in
her
mouth
she
started
a
conversation
a
shade
too
loudly
with
the
bartender
and
tried
to
drag
me
into
it
she
was
a
lean
brunette
with
shiny
eyes
and
trembling
hands
i
ordered
a
refill
for
her
and
moved
onto
the
bar
stool
next
to
her
we
exchanged
inanities
until
she
pointed
up
at
the
ceiling
with
her
thumb
and
said
going
to
try
your
luck
tonight
i
always
lucky
you
know
there
some
fellas
i
know
they
would
dare
try
the
crap
table
without

give
me
some
chips
to
get
in
the
game
i
do
want
to
gamble

i
get
tired
of
it
too
i
mean
when
you
just
seem
to
get
any
action
out
of
your
money
do
you
know
a
girl
around
town
named
toni
raselle
she
stopped
smiling
what
about
her

looking
for
her

larch
that

this
place
guys
like
eddie
they
really

a
yen
for
her
a
deal
like
that
you
can
fall
into
everything
laid
on
apartment
car
clothes
they
set
you
up
you
know
then
all
you
got
to
do
is
be
nice
and
take
it
easy
not
toni
she
strictly
wants
something
going
on
all
the
time
she
wants
to
lone
wolf
it
and
she
keeps
getting
in
jams
that
way
my
christ
you
think
she
liked
people
or
something
if
i
looked
like
her
i
parlay
that
right
into
stocks
and
bonds
believe
you
me
but
that
toni
she
does
as
she
damn
pleases
she
do
like
you
you
dead
so
you
can
have
bills
out
to
here

she
would
spit
if
your
hair
was
on
fire
how
she
crazy
man
i
think
i
see
what
you
mean
donna
sensed
she
made
some
sort
of
tactical
error
she
smiled
broadly
and
said
do
take
me
serious
that
about
parlaying
it
into
stocks
and
bonds
i
not
that
type
girl
i
like
a
few
laughs
i
like
to
get
around
my
boy
friend
is
away
and
i
got
lonesome
tonight
so
i
thought
i
take
a
look
around
see
what
going
on
you
know
how
it
is
lonesome
sure
you
would
want
to
see
if
you
lucky
i
guess
not
she
pursed
her
lips
and
studied
her
glass
she
tried
the
next
gambit
you
know
at
a
buck
a
drink
they
must
make
a
hell
of
a
lot
out
of
a
bottle
if
a
person
was
smart
they
do
their
drinking
at
home
it
would
be
a
lot
cheaper
it
certainly
would
you
know
if
we
could
get
a
bottle
i
got
glasses
and
ice
at
my
place
we
could
take
our
hair
down
and
put
our
feet
up
and
watch
the
teevee
and
have
a
ball
what
do
you
say
i
do
think
so
my
boy
friend
wo
be
back
in
town
until
next
weekend
i
got
my
own
place
no
thanks
donna

she
called
to
the
bartender
what
kind
of
place

running
you
got
a
dead
customer
sitting
here
he
giving
me
the
creepers
she
moved
over
two
stools
and
would
look
at
me
within
fifteen
minutes
two
heavy
smiling
men
came
in
soon
she
was
in
conversation
with
them
the
three
of
them
went
upstairs
together
to
try
the
tables
i
hoped
her
luck
was
good
after
she
was
gone
the
bartender
came
over
and
said
in
a
low
voice
the
boss
gives
me
the
word
to
keep
her
out
of
here
she
used
to
be
a
lot
better
looking
now
she
gets
drunk
and
nasty
but
when
he
around
i
let
her
stay
what
the
hell
it
old
times
like
they
say
you
know
how
it
is
sure
she
can
sure
get
nasty
and
she
wo
make
any
time
with
that
pair
did
you
dig
those
threads
a
small
beer
says
they
have
sixteen
bucks
between
the
pair
of
them
she
losing
her
touch
last
year
this
time
she
have
cut
off
their
water
before
they
said
word
one
old
donna
on
the
skids
what
will
she
do
he
shrugged
i
do
know
where
they
go
she
can
always
sign
for
a
tour
he
winked
see
the
world
see
all
the
ports
in
i
know
where
they
go
i
wandered
back
to
the
aztec
my
bartending
friend
told
me
that
toni
raselle
was
out
in
the
casino
in
back
escorted
by
a
general
he
said
she
was
wearing
a
white
blouse
and
skirt
and
had
an
evening
scarf
that
matched
her
skirt
i
tipped
him
and
went
out
into
the
casino
i
bought
chips
through
the
wicket
just
inside
the
door
the
large
room
was
crowded
it
was
brightly
whitely
lighted
like
an
operating
amphitheater
the
light
made
the
faces
of
the
people
look
sick
the
cards
the
chips
the
dice
the
wheels
were
all
in
pitiless
illumination
i
spotted
the
uniform
across
the
room
the
general
was
he
held
his
face
as
though
he
thought
he
resembled
macarthur
he
did
a
little
but
not
enough
he
had
three
rows
of
discreetly
faded
ribbons
antoinette
rasi
stood
beside
him
and
laughed
up
at
him
it
was
the
face
of
the
picture
matured
not
as
sullen
her
tumbled
hair
was
like
raw
silk
she
held
her
folded
over
her
arm
her
brown
shoulders
were
bare
she
was
warm
within
her
skin
moving
like
molten
honey
teeth
white
in
laughter
against
her
tan
face
wide
across
the
cheekbones
eyes
deep
set
nose
broad
at
the
bridge
feral
look
gypsy
look
a
mature
woman
so
alive
she
made
the
others
in
the
room
look
two
dimensional
as
though
they
had
been
carefully
placed
there
to
provide
their
drab
contrast
to
toni
look
of
greedy
life
they
were
at
the
roulette
table
i
stood
across
the
table
the
general
was
solemnly
playing
the
black
when
he
lost
toni
laughed
at
him
he
did
particularly
like
it
but
there
was
much
he
could
do
about
it
i
had
twenty
chips
i
began
playing
and
watching
her
instead
of
the
wheel
i
won
dollars
on
the
fourth
spin
i
began
to
play
the
red
and
kept
winning
toni
became
aware
of
my
interest
in
her
so
did
the
general
he
gave
me
a
mental
command
to
throw
myself
on
my
sword
toni
gave
me
a
few
irritated
glances
finally
the
general
had
to
go
back
to
the
window
to
buy
more
chips
they
did
sell
them
at
the
table
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
i
said
antoinette
she
looked
at
me
carefully
do
i
know
you
no
i
want
a
chance
to
talk
to
you
how
do
you
know
my
name
antoinette
rasi
through
timmy
warden
remember
him
of
course
i
ca
talk
now
phone
me
tomorrow
at
noon
eight
three
eight
nine
one
can
you
remember
that
eight
three
eight
nine
one
i
remember
the
general
came
back
staring
at
me
with
bitter
suspicion
i
went
away
taking
with
me
the
memory
of
her
dark
eyes
and
her
low
hoarse
husky
voice
i
drove
back
through
the
night
to
hillston
it
was
well
after
midnight
when
i
got
there
i
wondered
if
they
would
be
waiting
for
me
at
the
motel
but
the
sign
was
lighted
and
my
room
was
dark
i
went
to
bed
and
went
to
sleep
at
once
an
hour
later
i
awakened
abruptly
from
a
nightmare
i
was
drenched
with
sweat
i
had
dreamed
that
grassman
rode
my
back
his
legs
clamped
around
my
waist
his
heavy
arms
around
my
throat
i
walked
down
a
busy
street
with
him
there
asking
begging
for
help
but
they
would
scream
and
cover
their
eyes
and
shrink
away
from
me
and
i
knew
that
grassman
face
was
more
horrible
than
i
had
remembered
no
one
would
help
me
then
it
was
not
grassman
any
more
it
was
timmy
who
rode
there
i
could
smell
the
earth
we
had
buried
him
in
i
woke
up
in
panic
and
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
quiet
down
again
eight
i
called
her
at
noon
and
she
answered
on
the
tenth
ring
just
as
i
was
about
to
give
up
her
voice
was
blurred
with
sleep
whozit
tal
howard
who
i
spoke
to
you
last
night
at
the
aztec
about
timmy
warden
you
said
to
phone
i
could
hear
the
soft
yowl
of
her
complete
yawn
oh
sure
you
go
have
some
coffee
or
something
and
then
stop
around
here
i
live
at
a
place
called
the
glendon
arms
give
me
about
forty
minutes
to
wake
up
i
wasted
a
half
hour
over
coffee
and
a
newspaper
and
then
found
the
glendon
arms
without
difficulty
it
was
as
pretentious
as
its
name
with
striped
canopy
solid
glass
doors
mosaic
tile
lobby
floor
desk
clerk
with
dreary
sneer
he
phoned
and
told
me
i
could
go
right
up
to
miss
raselle
apartment
third
floor
the
elevator
was
the
hallway
was
wide
i
pushed
the
button
beside
her
door
she
opened
the
door
and
smiled
as
she
let
me
in
she
wore
a
white
angora
sleeveless
blouse
slacks
of
corduroy
in
a
green
plaid
i
had
expected
her
to
be
puffy
blurred
by
dissipation
full
of
a
morning
surliness
but
she
looked
fresh
golden
shining
and
clean
the
great
mop
of
black
hair
was
pulled
sleekly
back
and
fastened
into
an
intricate
rosette
hi
tal
howard
can
you
stand
more
coffee
come
along
there
was
a
small
breakfast
terrace
with
sliding
doors
that
opened
onto
it
from
the
bedroom
and
the
kitchen
the
sun
was
warm
on
the
terrace
we
had
coffee
and
rolls
and
butter
on
a
table
last
night
was
a
waste
she
said
he
was
a
friend
of
a
friend
a
stuffed
uniform
until
drink
number
ten
and
then
what
he
goes
with
his
hands
like
so
zoom
dadadadadada
gun
noises
fighter
planes
i
too
old
for
toys
he
had
a
lot
of
ribbons
he
told
me
what
they
were
for
several
times
how
did
you
track
me
down
tal
howard
through
your
sister
dear
god
anita
has
turned
into
a
real
slob
it
that
doyle
doyle
allows
that
the
sun
rises
and
sets
on
doyle
the
kids
are
nice
though
i
do
know
how
they
made
it
but
they
are
what
with
timmy
he
was
my
first
love
how
is
that
cutie
he
dead
toni
her
face
lost
its
life
you
certainly
did
waste
any
time
working
up
to
that
how
he
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
chinese
in
korea
so
was
i
we
were
in
the
same
hut
he
got
sick
and
died
there
and
we
buried
him
there
what
a
stinking
way
for
timmy
to
go
he
was
a
nice
guy
we
got
along
fine
right
up
into
the
second
year
of
high
school
and
then
he
started
considering
his
social
position
and
brushed
me
off
i
do
blame
him
he
was
too
young
to
know
any
better
he
left
me
to
take
a
big
hack
at
the
set
my
reputation
was
exactly
solid
gold
she
grinned
nor
is
it
yet
he
mentioned
you
while
we
were
in
camp
did
he
he
called
you
cindy
for
a
long
moment
she
looked
puzzled
and
then
her
face
cleared
oh
that
you
know
i
just
about
forgotten
that
it
was
sort
of
a
gag
in
that
eighth
grade
we
had
a
teacher
who
was
all
hopped
up
about
class
activities
i
was
the
rebel
she
stuck
me
in
a
play
as
cinderella
timmy
was
the
prince
he
called
me
cindy
for
quite
a
while
after
that
a
year
maybe
a
pretty
good
year
too
i
was
a
wild
kid
i
did
know
what
i
wanted
i
knew
that
what
i
had
i
did
want
but
i
did
know
how
to
make
a
change
i
was
too
young
gee
i
sorry
about
timmy
that
depressing
it
makes
me
feel
old
tal
i
do
like
to
feel
old
i
came
back
and
tried
to
find
a
cindy
i
did
know
your
right
name
i
found
a
couple
cindy
waskowitz
a
great
fat
pig
but
nothing
jolly
about
her
brother
she
was
as
nasty
as
they
come
she
dead
too
glandular
trouble
of
some
kind
could
you
go
around
wearing
a
wreath
or
singing
hymns
like
crossing
the
bar
i
sorry
then
there
was
cindy
kirschner
kirschner
wait
a
minute
a
younger
kid
teeth
like
this
that
right
but
she
had
them
fixed
now
she
has
a
husband
and
a
couple
of
kids
good
for
her
she
was
the
one
who
remembered
the
class
play
or
skit
or
whatever
it
was
and
the
name
of
the
teacher
miss
major
she
remember
who
played
cinderella
so
i
found
miss
major
she
went
blind
quite
a
while
ago
and
for
god
sake
tal
i
mean
really
i
sorry
anyway
she
identified
you
i
went
out
and
saw
your
sister
i
came
here
hunting
for
antoinette
rasi
the
way
your
sister
spoke
about
you
when
i
could
find
you
i
tried
the
police
they
told
me
the
name
you
use
then
it
was
easy
she
looked
at
me
coldly
and
dubiously
police
eh
they
give
you
all
the
bawdy
details
they
told
me
a
few
things
not
much
but
enough
enough
so
that
when
you
walked
in
here
you
had
to
act
like
a
little
kid
inspecting
a
leper
colony
what
the
hell
did
you
expect
to
find
a
room
all
mirrors
a
turnstile
do
get
sore
you
look
stuffy
to
me
tal
howard
stuffy
people
bore
me
so
what
the
hell
was
this
a
sentimental
journey
all
the
way
from
prison
camp
to
dig
up
poor
little
me
not
exactly
and
i
not
stuffy
and
i
do
give
a
damn
what
you
are
or
what
you
do
the
glare
faded
she
shrugged
and
said
skip
it
i
do
know
why
i
should
all
of
a
sudden
get
sensitive
i
living
the
way
i
want
to
live
i
guess
it
just
from
talking
about
timmy
that
was
a
tender
spot
from
thinking
about
the
way
i
was
at
thirteen
i
wanted
to
lick
the
world
with
my
bare
hands
now
i
do
i
look
it
no
you
really
do
she
rested
her
cheek
on
her
fist
she
looked
thoughtful
you
know
tal
howard
another
reason
why
i
think
i
jumped
on
you
i
think
beginning
to
get
bored
i
think
i
due
for
some
kind
of
a
change
like
what
more
than
a
new
town
i
do
know
just
restless
skip
that
you
said
this
was
exactly
a
sentimental
journey
what
is
it
there
something
else
involved
mystery
hey
what
with
you
how
do
you
mean
what
do
you
do
you
married
i
not
doing
anything
right
now
i
not
married
i
came
here
from
the
west
coast
i
have
got
any
permanent
address
you
not
the
type
how
do
you
mean
that
that
information
does
fit
you
somehow
so
it
just
a
temporary
thing
with
you
you
between
lives
are
you
and
maybe
as
restless
as
i
am
i
could
be
she
winked
at
me
and
i
think
you
been
taking
yourself
too
seriously
lately
have
you
noticed
that
i
guess
i
have
now
what
the
mystery
i
looking
for
something
timmy
hid
something
before
he
left
i
know
what
it
is
i
do
know
where
it
is
before
he
died
not
very
many
hours
before
he
died
timmy
said
would
know
that
why
here
here
from
the
west
coast
looking
for
cindy
he
hid
something
nice
then
like
some
nice
money
if
you
can
help
me
i
give
you
some
money
how
much
it
depends
on
how
much
he
hid
maybe
you
admitted
too
fast
that
it
was
money
tal
i
am
noted
for
my
fondness
for
money
it
pleases
me
i
like
the
feel
of
it
and
the
smell
of
it
and
the
look
of
it
i
nuts
about
it
i
like
all
i
can
get
maybe
because
i
spent
so
much
time
without
any
of
it
a
psychiatrist
friend
told
me
it
was
my
basic
drive
i
ca
ever
have
too
much
if
that
was
really
your
basic
drive
you
would
say
it
like
that
i
do
think
it
just
the
way
you
like
to
think
you
are
she
was
angry
again
why
does
every
type
you
meet
try
to
tell
you
what
you
really
are
it
a
popular
hobby
so
all
right
he
hid
something
now
i
got
a
big
fat
disappointment
for
you
i
would
have
any
idea
where
he
hid
something
i
do
know
what
he
means
are
you
sure
do
look
at
me
like
that
i
know
what
you
thinking
thinking
i
know
and
i
wo
tell
you
because
i
want
it
all
honestly
tal
i
do
know
i
ca
think
what
he
could
have
meant
i
believed
her
this
sun
is
actually
getting
too
hot
let
go
inside
she
said
i
helped
carry
the
things
in
she
rinsed
the
dishes
having
seen
her
the
previous
evening
i
would
not
have
thought
she
had
the
sort
of
figure
to
wear
slacks
successfully
they
were
beautifully
tailored
and
she
looked
well
in
them
we
went
into
the
it
was
slightly
overfurnished
the
lamps
were
in
bad
taste
but
it
was
clean
and
comfortable
she
sat
on
the
couch
and
pulled
one
leg
up
and
locked
her
hands
around
her
knee
want
to
hear
about
timmy
and
me
the
sad
story
not
sad
i
guess
if
you
want
to
tell
it
i
never
told
anybody
maybe
it
time
i
turned
fifteen
before
i
got
out
of
the
eighth
grade
i
was
older
than
the
other
kids
timmy
was
fourteen
he
was
the
biggest
boy
in
class
we
never
had
anything
to
do
with
each
other
until
that
skit
we
practiced
a
couple
of
times
we
got
to
be
friends
it
was
a
thing
more
like
a
couple
of
boys
i
was
the
most
feminine
creature
in
the
world
believe
me
i
could
run
like
the
wind
and
i
could
fight
with
my
fists
i
did
want
timmy
to
come
out
to
the
house
i
was
ashamed
of
where
i
lived
i
never
wanted
any
of
the
kids
to
see
how
and
where
i
lived
my
god
we
lived
like
animals
it
was
so
bad
until
my
mother
died
but
from
then
on
it
was
pretty
bad
you
saw
the
place
i
saw
it
the
old
man
kept
pretty
well
soaked
in
his
my
brother
was
completely
no
good
my
sister
slept
with
anybody
who
took
the
trouble
to
ask
her
we
lived
in
filth
we
were
on
the
county
relief
rolls
the
brought
us
food
and
clothing
at
thanksgiving
and
christmas
i
was
proud
as
hell
inside
i
could
see
any
way
out
the
best
i
could
do
was
try
to
keep
myself
clean
as
a
button
and
not
let
any
of
the
kids
come
out
there
she
came
over
and
took
one
of
my
cigarettes
bent
over
for
me
to
light
it
timmy
came
out
there
it
nearly
killed
me
then
i
saw
that
it
was
all
right
he
did
pay
any
attention
to
the
way
things
were
i
mean
it
did
seem
to
mean
much
to
him
that
the
way
they
were
so
the
way
they
were
he
was
my
friend
after
that
i
was
able
to
talk
to
him
he
understood
he
had
his
dreams
too
we
talked
over
our
dreams
when
school
was
out
that
summer
he
came
out
a
lot
he
used
to
cut
lawns
and
make
money
and
we
go
to
the
movies
we
used
to
swim
in
the
river
he
come
out
on
his
bike
he
got
hold
of
a
bike
for
me
he
fixed
it
up
and
i
painted
it
then
we
could
get
around
better
the
relief
people
gave
the
old
man
a
hard
ride
for
buying
me
a
bike
i
had
to
explain
how
i
got
it
and
prove
i
did
steal
it
i
can
still
remember
the
sneaky
eyes
on
that
cop
when
it
happened
to
us
it
was
sudden
it
was
in
late
august
gotten
a
job
in
the
dime
store
by
lying
about
my
age
and
filling
out
the
forms
wrong
i
was
squirreling
the
money
away
i
spent
sundays
with
timmy
his
brother
and
his
father
did
like
him
to
see
me
but
he
managed
it
he
had
a
basket
on
the
front
of
his
bike
and
we
went
off
on
a
sunday
picnic
we
went
a
long
way
into
the
country
fifteen
miles
i
guess
we
walked
the
bikes
up
a
trail
we
found
a
place
under
trees
where
it
was
like
a
park
it
was
far
away
from
anybody
we
could
have
been
alone
in
the
world
maybe
we
were
we
ate
and
then
we
stretched
out
and
talked
about
how
high
school
would
be
when
it
started
in
september
it
was
hot
we
were
in
the
shade
he
went
to
sleep
i
watched
him
while
he
was
sleeping
the
way
his
eyelashes
were
and
the
way
he
looked
like
a
little
kid
when
he
slept
i
felt
a
big
warmth
inside
me
it
was
a
new
way
to
feel
toward
him
when
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
i
slipped
my
arm
under
his
neck
and
half
lay
across
him
and
kissed
him
he
woke
up
with
me
kissing
him
he
was
funny
and
kind
of
half
scared
and
sort
of
half
eager
at
the
same
time
i
had
a
pretty
liberal
education
as
you
can
well
imagine
i
guess
it
was
pretty
sad
two
kids
being
as
awkward
and
fumbling
as
you
can
possibly
imagine
there
on
that
hill
in
the
shade
but
awkward
as
we
were
it
happened
we
hardly
talked
at
all
on
the
way
back
i
knew
enough
to
be
damn
scared
but
fortunately
nothing
happened
from
then
on
we
were
different
with
each
other
it
got
to
be
something
we
did
whenever
we
had
a
chance
it
got
better
and
better
for
us
but
we
were
friends
the
way
we
were
before
sometimes
we
seemed
almost
to
be
enemies
we
tried
to
hurt
each
other
it
was
a
strong
hunger
we
found
good
places
to
go
it
lasted
for
a
year
and
a
half
we
never
talked
about
marriage
or
things
like
that
we
lived
for
now
there
was
one
place
we
would
go
we
take
one
of
the
boats
and
she
stopped
abruptly
we
looked
into
each
other
eyes
now
you
know
where
he
meant
i
asked
her
softly
i
think
i
do
where
i
do
think
we
can
handle
it
that
way
do
you
how
do
you
mean
i
think
we
better
go
there
together
do
you
there
nothing
to
keep
you
from
going
there
by
yourself
antoinette
i
know
that
what
would
it
mean
if
i
told
you
i
wo
in
spite
of
the
money
hunger
i
would
be
honest
with
a
thing
like
this
i
would
believe
me
have
known
nothing
about
it
how
much
is
there
i
waited
several
moments
measuring
her
and
the
situation
i
get
to
it
without
her
nearly
sixty
thousand
he
said
she
sat
down
abruptly
saying
a
soundless
how
how
would
timmy
get
hold
of
money
like
that
he
did
all
the
book
work
for
the
four
companies
he
and
his
brother
owned
he
took
over
two
years
milking
that
much
in
cash
out
of
the
four
companies
why
would
he
do
that
to
george
it
does
sound
like
timmy
he
planned
to
run
off
with
eloise
that
thing
george
married
that
pig
i
knew
her
where
is
she
she
went
off
with
another
man
two
years
ago
maybe
she
took
the
money
with
her
timmy
said
she
did
know
where
he
buried
it
and
she
hardly
be
able
to
find
it
i
can
guarantee
that
so
this
is
george
money
then
is
it
i
waited
a
moment
yes
it
is
but
it
was
already
stolen
that
right
and
nobody
knows
about
it
george
does
suspect
nobody
knows
about
it
but
you
and
me
tal
there
another
one
who
knows
about
it
a
man
named
earl
fitzmartin
he
was
in
the
camp
too
he
did
know
about
the
name
cindy
now
he
does
he
smart
he
may
be
able
to
trace
the
name
to
you
what
he
like
he
smart
and
he
vicious
so
are
a
lot
of
my
friends
i
do
think
they
like
fitz
i
do
think
you
could
go
with
fitz
and
find
it
and
come
back
from
wherever
you
went
to
find
it
that
is
if
it
was
a
quiet
place
and
he
could
put
you
where
he
dug
up
the
money
like
that
i
think
so
i
think
there
something
wrong
in
his
head
i
do
think
he
very
much
like
other
people
can
you
and
i
can
we
trust
each
other
tal
i
think
we
can
we
shook
hands
with
formal
ceremony
she
looked
at
me
quizzically
how
about
you
tal
why
are
you
after
the
money
like
they
say
about
climbing
mountains
because
it
there
what
will
it
mean
to
you
i
do
know
i
have
to
find
it
first
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
going
to
be
some
kind
of
an
answer
to
everything
maybe
what
fouled
you
up
tal
what
broke
your
wagon
i
do
know
i
can
place
most
people
i
ca
quite
place
you
you
look
like
one
type
you
know
played
ball
in
school
sells
bonds
or
something
working
up
to
a
house
a
brooks
wardrobe
and
some
day
winter
vacations
in
bermuda
after
the
kids
are
in
college
you
look
like
that
all
except
the
eyes
and
the
eyes
do
look
like
that
at
all
what
do
they
look
like
the
eyes
on
the
horse
that
knows
they
going
to
shoot
him
because
he
was
clumsy
and
busted
his
leg
when
do
we
go
after
the
money
she
stepped
to
the
kitchen
door
and
looked
at
the
clock
you
feel
better
if
we
stayed
together
until
we
get
it
would
you
i
guess
i
would
but
it
is
essential
your
faith
is
touching
did
the
police
give
you
the
word
they
said
something
about
a
cute
variation
of
the
badger
game
it
was
very
cute
they
could
convict
and
it
was
very
dishonest
tal
but
it
was
a
case
of
fleecing
the
innocent
it
was
pulled
on
some
citizens
who
were
trying
to
make
a
dishonest
buck
like
this
i
tell
them
my
boy
friend
is
on
one
of
the
wheels
at
the
aztec
i
tell
the
sucker
the
wheel
is
gimmicked
my
boy
friend
is
sore
at
the
house
the
sucker
has
to
have
two
or
three
thousand
he
wants
trebled
i
say
i
ca
go
in
with
him
i
give
him
a
password
to
tell
the
boy
friend
so
they
let
him
win
six
or
seven
thousand
he
comes
here
with
the
money
the
boy
friend
is
to
show
up
later
but
when
the
boy
friend
shows
up
he
is
with
a
very
citizen
who
holds
a
gun
on
him
gun
has
silencer
evil
type
shoots
boy

with
a
blank
boy
friend
groans
and

or

time

does
want
to

mixed
up
in
any
murder
house
money
goes
back
to
house
i
get
a
cut
of
the
take
i
love
acting
you
should
see
me
tremble
and
faint
suppose
he
does
come
back
here
with
the
money
they
always
have
they
like
to
win
the
money
and
the
girl
too
they
think
it
like
the
movies
now
will
you
trust
me
out
of
your
sight
i
have
to
wo
i
i
guess
that
it
you
have
to
she
smiled
lazily
i
have
some
errands
you
can
wait
here
i
going
places
where
you
ca
go
you
can
wait
here
or
you
can
meet
me
here
it
going
to
take
three
or
four
hours
by
then
it
going
to
be
too
late
to
get
to
the
money
today
we
can
go
after
it
tomorrow
morning
how
are
we
going
to
divide
it
up
should
we
count
it
first
but
after
we
count
it
she
came
toward
me
and
put
her
hands
on
my
shoulders
maybe
we
divide
it
up
tal
maybe
we
wo
squirrel
it
away
it
free
money
maybe
we
just
put
it
in
the
pot
and
spend
it
as
we
need
it
until
it
all
gone
maybe
we
see
how
far
we
can
distribute
it
we
could
spread
it
from
acapulco
to
paris
then
maybe
we
wo
be
restless
any
more
it
would
buy
some
drinks
to
timmy
in
some
nice
places
i
felt
uneasy
i
said
i
not
that
attractive
to
you
i
know
you
not
i
like
men
she
took
her
hands
away
maybe
to
you
i
like
they
used
to
say
in
the
books
damaged
goods
not
visibly
she
shook
her
head
you
kill
me
it
was
just
an
idea
you
seem
nice
and
quiet
not
demanding
let
say
restful
you
said
you
do
know
what
you
do
with
the
money
i
said
maybe
i
know
when
i
get
it
and
if
you
do
then
we
talk
some
more
you
wait
here
i
meet
you
here
at
she
said
she
had
to
change
i
left
i
wondered
if
i
was
being
a
fool
i
had
lunch
i
did
have
much
appetite
i
went
to
a
movie
i
follow
the
movie
i
was
worrying
too
much
i
began
to
be
convinced
i
had
been
a
fool
she
was
the
sort
of
woman
to
trust
i
wondered
by
what
magic
she
had
hypnotized
me
into
trusting
her
i
could
imagine
her
digging
up
the
money
once
she
had
it
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
i
wondered
if
my
trust
had
been
based
on
some
inner
unwillingness
to
actually
take
the
money
maybe
subconsciously
i
wanted
the
moral
problem
off
my
hands
she
was
back
at
i
waited
in
the
lobby
i
was
sweating
she
came
in
at
quarter
to
six
she
looked
pale
and
upset
we
rode
up
in
the
elevator
together
she
gave
me
the
key
to
open
her
door
her
fingers
were
cold
she
kept
biting
her
lip
once
we
were
inside
she
began
to
pace
what
the
matter
shut
up
and
let
me
think
go
make
some
drinks
that
thing
there
is
a
bar
scotch
on
the
rocks
for
me
i
made
the
drinks
after
hers
was
gone
she
seemed
a
little
quieter
more
thoughtful
sorry
for
being
bitchy
tal
i
upset
my
errands
did
work
out
the
way
i
expected
some
people
seem
to
have
the
idea
that
just
because
i
was
in
on
the
festivities
i
belong
to
the
house
you
do
need
details
i
have
some
funds
around
here
and
there
i
got
to
the
bank
in
time
that
was
fine
but
it
was
so
good
on
the
funds
that
are
in
shall
we
say
safekeeping
i
got
some
of
them
not
all
that
coming
to
me
not
by
a
hell
of
a
lot
i
not
supposed
to
be
able
to
take
off
i
made
the
mistake
of
saying
i
was
thinking
about
it
they
gave
me
some
strong
arguments
i
made
like
changing
my
mind
still
i
was
tailed
back
how
do
you
like
that
the
hell
with
them
they
might
even
be
thinking
of
a
hijack
job
now
i
know
i
got
to
get
out
of
here
i
think
i
got
it
worked
out
will
you
help
i
guess
so
i
leaving
for
good
i
ca
make
it
tomorrow
maybe
tomorrow
i
can
pick
up
a
little
more
of
what
due
me
you
drive
over
here
thursday
morning
there
a
back
way
out
of
here
through
the
cellar
i
can
grease
the
superintendent
park
on
the
parallel
street
back
of
here
be
there
at
ten
sharp
ten
in
the
morning
i
come
out
the
back
way
and
away
we
go
but
damn
it
i
hate
to
leave
so
much
stuff
behind
a
whole
wardrobe
is
it
dangerous
i
do
know
how
rough
they
might
get
i
just
do
like
the
sound
of
it
i
do
like
being
patted
on
the
shoulder
and
being
given
a
big
toothy
grin
and
being
told
there
little
toni
you
do
want
to
leave
town
we
all
love
you
too
much
i
said
i
could
stay
until
after
dark
and
you
could
pack
things
and
i
could
take
them
out
maybe
a
couple
of
suitcases
you
sure
you
want
to
i
willing
to
if
somebody
followed
you
they
do
know
i
here
now
you
could
leave
before
i
do
they
follow
you
then
i
can
take
the
stuff
out
to
my
car
that
should
work
all
right
gosh
it
would
really
help
i
put
a
lot
of
money
in
clothes
i
think
it
would
be
better
than
trying
to
get
the
stuff
out
in
the
morning
even
with
your
help
i
want
it
to
move
fast
and
smoothly
stay
away
from
the
windows
she
spent
a
lot
of
time
packing
it
was
dark
when
she
finished
she
filled
two
big
suitcases
they
bulged
and
they
were
heavy
leave
them
wherever
you
staying
when
you
come
back
for
me
it
a
motel
get
me
a
room
too
please
she
seemed
to
relax
then
i
think
it
going
to
work
out
tal
they
sort
of
scared
me
i
know
a
lot
i
do
plan
to
do
any
talking
that
what
worries
them
i
think
you
do
know
how
much
i
appreciate
this
i
make
it
up
to
you
she
wanted
to
be
kissed
and
i
kissed
her
there
was
an
eagerness
and
warmth
and
sensuality
about
her
that
made
it
a
shock
to
touch
her
and
hold
her
we
rocked
off
balance
as
we
kissed
caught
ourselves
smiled
a
little
sheepishly
for
now
she
said
i
took
the
suitcases
into
the
hall
she
went
on
down
i
waited
there
for
fifteen
minutes
and
then
i
went
down
the
clerk
was
very
dubious
about
my
leaving
with
suitcases
he
seemed
about
to
speak
but
quite
know
what
to
say
i
was
gone
before
he
had
phrased
the
objection
i
put
the
suitcases
in
the
back
seat
and
drove
to
hillston
i
ate
at
a
on
the
edge
of
town
i
took
the
suitcases
back
to
my
motel
room
they
were
an
alien
presence
there
almost
as
vivid
as
if
she
were
there
with
me
i
stowed
them
in
the
closet
nine
wednesday
was
a
gray
day
i
had
hidden
grassman
body
on
monday
it
seemed
longer
ago
than
monday
the
memory
was
very
vivid
but
it
seemed
to
be
something
that
had
happened
a
long
time
ago
i
saw
the
suitcases
when
i
opened
my
closet
to
get
at
my
own
clothes
i
was
curious
about
what
she
had
packed
i
felt
guilty
about
opening
them
then
i
decided
that
i
had
earned
the
right
to
look
i
put
the
larger
one
on
the
bed
and
tried
the
latches
it
locked
it
popped
open
there
were
furs
on
top
silky
and
lustrous
she
had
packed
neatly
underneath
the
furs
were
suits
dresses
skirts
blouses
the
bottom
layer
was
underclothing
slips
panties
with
frothy
lace
and
intricate
embroidery
in
shades
from
purest
white
through
all
of
the
spectrum
to
black
the
other
suitcase
was
much
the
same
the
clothing
was
fresh
and
fragrant
with
perfume
it
was
perfume
that
was
not
musky
it
had
a
clean
flower
scent
i
could
understand
how
this
was
important
to
her
i
remembered
her
speaking
of
the
charity
gifts
of
clothing
of
the
dirt
in
which
she
had
grown
up
she
would
want
clothing
a
great
deal
of
it
and
all
fresh
and
clean
i
found
the
black
leather
box
in
the
bottom
of
the
second
suitcase
i
opened
it
jewelry
lay
against
a
black
velvet
partition
bracelets
rings
clips
i
could
not
tell
if
the
white
and
green
and
red
stones
were
real
they
were
lustrous
they
caught
fire
in
the
light
but
i
could
not
tell
i
lifted
the
partition
there
was
money
under
it
money
in
fifties
and
twenties
and
hundreds
a
sizable
stack
of
bills
i
counted
it
there
was
six
thousand
and
forty
dollars
when
i
replaced
the
partition
the
stones
looked
more
real
after
the
suitcases
were
back
in
the
closet
i
wondered
what
her
thinking
had
been
when
she
had
packed
the
money
in
there
perhaps
she
assumed
i
would
search
the
bags
i
had
intended
to
maybe
she
thought
that
even
if
i
did
search
them
and
did
find
the
money
it
would
be
safer
with
me
than
it
would
in
the
apartment
she
could
have
been
right
it
was
safe
with
me
even
had
i
been
the
sort
of
person
to
take
it
and
leave
that
sort
of
person
would
have
waited
for
the
chance
of
acquiring
much
more
a
chance
only
antoinette
could
provide
i
found
the
bird
woman
cleaning
one
of
the
rooms
i
paid
her
another
two
nights
in
advance
for
myself
and
asked
her
to
save
the
room
next
to
mine
for
a
friend
who
would
check
in
on
thursday
i
gave
her
one
night
rental
on
the
second
room
as
i
drove
toward
town
i
found
myself
wondering
if
what
antoinette
had
proposed
might
be
the
best
solution
for
me
it
was
tempting
i
thought
of
the
ripeness
of
her
the
pungency
of
her
personality
the
very
startling
impact
of
her
lips
there
would
be
no
illusions
between
us
she
would
make
it
easy
to
forget
a
lot
of
things
we
would
have
no
claims
on
each
other
and
would
be
wedded
only
by
the
money
and
divorced
when
it
was
gone
after
i
ate
i
went
to
the
hardware
store
i
parked
a
half
block
from
it
i
wanted
to
talk
to
george
again
i
wanted
to
see
if
i
could
steer
the
conversation
toward
eloise
and
fulton
i
wanted
to
see
if
he
would
say
anything
that
would
make
more
sense
out
of
the
grassman
death
obviously
fitz
had
contacted
antoinette
and
she
seemed
confident
that
no
one
else
could
find
the
money
so
it
began
to
appear
less
logical
that
grassman
death
had
anything
to
do
with
the
sixty
thousand
then
why
had
grassman
been
killed
he
could
have
gotten
into
some
kind
of
argument
with
fitz
we
had
seen
grassman
at
the
lake
on
saturday
somehow
i
had
spoiled
things
with
ruth
and
so
i
had
gotten
drunk
on
saturday
and
again
on
sunday
fitz
could
have
killed
him
on
sunday
not
meaning
to
do
so
he
could
have
loaded
the
body
in
his
car
and
gone
looking
for
some
place
to
put
it
and
spotted
my
car
the
california
plates
would
be
easy
to
spot
but
by
putting
the
body
in
my
car
he
would
be
eliminating
any
chance
of
my
leading
him
to
the
money
timmy
had
buried
but
maybe
fitz
was
convinced
that
with
the
clue
in
his
possession
with
the
name
cindy
he
could
accomplish
as
much
or
more
than
i
could
he
was
a
man
of
great
confidence
in
himself
and
not
i
had
begun
to
believe
entirely
sane
if
grassman
had
contacted
fitz
perhaps
george
could
provide
me
with
some
meaningful
clue
as
to
why
but
there
was
a
sign
on
the
door
the
store
was
closed
the
sign
gave
no
additional
information
it
was
crudely
printed
on
paper
to
the
inside
of
the
door
i
cupped
my
hands
on
the
glass
and
looked
inside
the
stock
did
not
seem
to
be
disturbed
it
could
not
mean
closed
for
good
it
took
me
several
minutes
to
remember
where
george
lived
i
remember
who
had
told
me
white
hotel
i
found
it
three
blocks
away
it
was
a
frame
building
it
was
seedy
looking
depressing
it
had
once
been
painted
yellow
and
white
i
went
into
the
lobby
old
men
sat
in
scuffed
leather
chairs
and
smoked
and
read
the
papers
two
pimpled
boys
stood
by
the
desk
making
intense
work
out
of
selecting
the
right
holes
to
punch
on
a
punchboard
while
the
desk
man
watched
them
his
eyes
bored
his
heavy
face
slack
smoke
curling
up
from
the
cigarette
between
his
lips
i
want
to
see
george
warden
second
floor
the
stairs
are
over
there
a
girl
just
went
on
up
to
see
him
a
minute
ago
i
hesitated
and
he
said
go
ahead
on
up
room
she
takes
care
of
him
when
he
gets
in
rough
shape
okay
george
got
taken
drunk
the
last
couple
of
days
she
tried
to
phone
him
and
he
would
answer
the
room
phone
so
she
came
on
down
just
now
got
here
i
guessed
it
was
ruth
i
wanted
to
see
her
i
did
know
how
react
to
me
i
did
want
to
talk
to
george
with
her
there
though
i
went
up
the
stairs
slowly
when
my
eyes
were
above
the
level
of
the
second
floor
i
saw
ruth
running
down
the
gloomy
hall
toward
me
i
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
just
as
she
got
there
her
eyes
were
wide
and
unfocused
her
mouth
was
working
her
face
was
like
wet
paper
i
called
her
name
and
she
focused
on
me
hesitated
and
then
came
into
my
arms
she
was
trembling
all
over
she
ground
her
forehead
against
my
chin
rocking
her
head
from
side
to
side
making
an
odd
chattering
moaning
sound
after
a
few
moments
she
regained
enough
control
to
speak
it
george
in
the
room
on
the
bed
wait
right
here
n
no
i
got
to
telephone
police
her
high
heels
chattered
down
the
wooden
stairs
i
went
back
to
room
the
door
was
open
george
lay
across
the
bed
naked
there
was
a
rifle
on
the
floor
a
towel
was
loosely
wrapped
around
the
muzzle
it
was
scorched
where
the
slug
had
gone
through
it
i
moved
uneasily
around
to
where
i
could
see
his
head
the
back
of
his
head
was
blown
off
i
knew
that
before
i
saw
his
head
because
i
had
seen
the
smeared
wall
in
the
instant
of
death
all
body
functions
had
shared
the
smeared
explosion
the
room
stank
his
body
had
a
gray
withered
look
i
moved
backward
to
the
door
i
backed
through
it
into
the
hall
i
mopped
my
forehead
it
was
a
hell
of
a
thing
for
ruth
to
have
walked
in
on
they
could
just
as
well
move
the
sign
to
this
door
to
this
life
closed
closed
for
good
i
stood
there
in
the
hall
and
heard
the
sirens
the
desk
clerk
came
lumbering
down
the
hall
old
men
from
the
lobby
followed
him
they
crowded
by
me
and
filled
the
doorway
and
stared
in
good
christ
the
desk
clerk
said
my
oh
my
oh
my
said
one
of
the
old
men
some
of
the
faces
were
familiar
i
knew
hillis
and
i
knew
brubaker
and
i
knew
prine
prine
was
not
on
top
this
time
he
was
taking
orders
from
a
captain
marion
captain
marion
was
a
mild
sandy
man
who
wanted
everything
cozy
and
neighborly
he
had
a
wide
face
full
of
smile
wrinkles
and
a
soft
buzzing
voice
and
little
blue
eyes
sunk
back
beyond
the
thick
crisp
blond
curl
of
his
eyebrows
rather
than
individual
questioning
he
made
it
a
seminar
i
could
tell
from
prine
bleak
look
that
he
did
not
approve
at
all
they
got
us
all
down
into
a
room
in
police
headquarters
there
was
a
stenotype
operator
present
captain
marion
apologized
for
inconveniencing
anybody
he
apologized
several
times
he
shifted
papers
and
cleared
his
throat
and
coughed
well
now
as
i
finish
with
you
people
i
tell
you
whether
you
can
take
off
or
not
nothing
particularly
official
about
this
it
a
sort
of
investigation
get
the
facts
in
front
of
us
let
see
what
we
got
here
first
let
me
say
a
couple
of
words
about
george
i
knew
his
daddy
well
and
i
knew
george
well
and
i
knew
timmy
george
could
have
been
a
big
man
in
this
town
he
was
on
his
way
in
that
direction
but
he
lost
his
grip
lots
of
men
never
seem
to
get
back
on
the
ball
after
bad
wife
trouble
but
i
had
hopes
george
would
pull
out
of
it
seems
to
me
like
he
did
and
that
too
bad
it
quite
a
waste
george
was
a
bright
man
i
saw
prine
shift
his
weight
restlessly
i
got
it
right
here
on
this
paper
that
the
body
was
discovered
at
twenty
minutes
after
ten
this
morning
by
ruth
stamm
now
ruthie
what
in
the
wide
world
were
you
doing
down
there
at
that
white
hotel
henr
i
mean
captain
marion
george
did
have
anybody
to
look
after
him
every
once
in
a
while
i
sort
of
help
him
get
straightened
out
you
used
to
go
with
timmy
did
you
yes
i
did
i
was
trying
to
help
george
did
buck
approve
of
that
i
do
think
so
i
mean
i
know
he
did
i
see
ruthie
what
took
you
down
there
this
morning
i
went
by
the
store
yesterday
afternoon
and
there
was
a
closed
sign
on
it
it
worried
me
after
i
got
home
i
phoned
white
hotel
herman
watkins
was
on
the
desk
he
told
me
george
was
drinking
this
morning
i
phoned
the
store
and
there
was
no
answer
then
i
tried
the
hotel
george
would
answer
the
room
phone
he
does
that
sometimes
i
mean
he
used
to
do
that
i
have
a
key
so
i
drove
down
and
went
up
to
the
room
the
door
was
even
locked
i
opened
it
and
i
saw
him
what
were
you
planning
to
do
get
him
some
coffee
get
him
cleaned
up
give
him
a
good
talking
to
i
guess
as
i
done
before
ruthie
you
can
stay
or
go
just
as
you
please
now
then
i
got
this
other
name
here
talbert
howard
you
came
along
right
after
ruthie
what
were
you
doing
there
i
saw
ruth
stamm
start
to
get
up
and
then
sit
back
down
i
wanted
to
talk
to
george
i
saw
that
the
store
was
closed
so
i
went
to
the
hotel
what
did
you
want
to
talk
about
prine
answered
for
me
we
had
this
man
in
last
week
captain
we
thought
he
was
another
one
of
those
people
rose
fulton
keeps
sending
down
here
this
man
claims
he
writing
a
book
about
men
who
died
in
the
prison
camp
where
timmy
warden
died
this
man
claims
he
was
there
too
he
never
written
a
book
he
unemployed
has
no
permanent
address
and
has
a
record
of
one
conviction
for
what
i
answered
for
myself
for
taking
part
in
a
student
riot
when
i
was
in
school
disturbing
the
peace
and
resisting
an
officer
the
officer
broke
my
collarbone
with
a
nightstick
that
was
called
resisting
an
officer
captain
marion
looked
at
prine
steve
you
make
everything
sound
so
damn
serious
maybe
this
boy
wants
to
write
a
book
maybe
he
trying
i
happen
to
doubt
it
captain
prine
said
what
did
you
want
to
talk
to
george
about
son
i
wanted
more
information
about
timmy
i
glanced
at
ruth
she
was
looking
at
me
with
contempt
she
looked
away
what
happened
when
you
got
there
the
desk
clerk
told
me
a
girl
had
just
gone
up
i
met
miss
stamm
when
i
got
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
she
was
too
upset
to
talk
i
got
a
look
in
that
room
myself
hardly
blame
her
terrible
looking
sight
all
right
son
you
can
go
if
you
want
to
i
prefer
him
to
stay
if
you
do
mind
captain
marion
sighed
all
right
steve
stick
around
howard
now
herman
we
get
to
you
the
doc
says
he
can
fix
the
time
of
death
about
midnight
last
night
he
may
be
able
to
get
it
a
little
closer
but
he
says
that
a
pretty
good
guess
did
you
see
george
come
in
no
sir
i
did
see
him
it
was
a
pretty
noisy
night
last
night
there
were
a
lot
of
people
coming
and
going
i
heard
george
was
doing
his
drinking
at
stump
until
stump
would
serve
him
any
more
he
left
there
about
ten
frankly
captain
i
was
playing
a
little
poker
in
the
room
behind
where
the
desk
is
i
ca
see
the
desk
from
there
but
i
can
hear
the
bell
on
the
desk
and
hear
the
switchboard
if
any
calls
come
in
that
why
i
brought
caswell
along
with
me
i
caswell
a
little
old
man
said
he
had
a
thin
high
voice
and
an
excited
manner
bartholomew
boris
caswell
retired
eleven
years
ago
i
was
a
conductor
on
the
erie
and
western
railroad
i
not
what
you
call
a
drinking
man
and
i
see
george
warden
come
in
i
was
behind
him
maybe
half
a
block
i
just
happened
to
look
at
my
watch
because
i
wondered
what
time
i
was
getting
in
watch
said
eleven
lose
a
minute
a
month
see
it
one
of
the
best
ever
made
right
now
it
eleven
minutes
of
two
and
that
clock
on
the
wall
over
your
head
captain
is
running
two
minutes
slow
are
you
sure
it
was
george
sure
as
i
know
my
own
name
man
alive
he
was
drunk
wagging
his
arms
staggering
all
over
if
it
was
for
his
friend
he
never
have
made
it
home
who
was
his
friend
do
know
him
and
did
get
a
look
at
him
man
though
stiff
in
one
leg
like
a
limp
he
horsepowered
george
right
into
the
hotel
time
i
came
in
they
were
gone
upstairs
the
lobby
was
empty
i
could
hear
some
of
the
boys
hooting
and
hollering
and
carrying
on
up
on
the
second
floor
so
i
went
there
they
were
back
in
lester
room
he
had
himself
two
gallons
of
red
wine
at
least
he
started
with
two
gallons
i
had
myself
a
little
out
of
my
own
glass
that
i
got
from
my
room
it
did
set
so
good
on
what
i
had
been
drinking
did
set
good
at
all
it
like
to
come
up
on
me
so
i
went
on
down
to
bed
got
into
my
room
at
three
after
midnight
right
then
i
heard
a
funny
noise
just
when
i
was
closing
my
door
it
sounded
a
little
like
somebody
dropped
a
book
or
maybe
tipped
over
in
a
chair
and
thumped
his
head
i
listened
and
i
did
hear
anything
else
so
i
went
right
to
bed
it
turns
out
that
must
have
been
when
george
shot
himself
that
would
fit
what
the
doctor
says
herman
could
you
find
anybody
else
who
heard
anything
i
could
find
anybody
else
at
all
you
do
need
anybody
else
caswell
said
i
told
you
all
got
to
know
have
i
thanks
caswell
you
can
go
along
if
you
want
to
i
stay
and
see
what
happens
thank
you
captain
marion
studied
the
papers
in
front
of
him
and
then
muttered
to
himself
for
a
while
at
last
he
looked
up
it
not
up
to
me
to
make
any
decision
that
be
up
to
the
inquest
but
i
think
we
can
figure
that
george
was
pretty
beat
down
lost
his
wife
lost
his
brother
lost
most
of
his
business
drinking
heavy
it
certainly
looks
to
me
that
if
any
man
had
reasons
for
suicide
george
did
steve
you
look
uneasy
what
on
your
mind
captain
i
do
think
it
that
easy
i
seen
some
suicides
read
up
on
them
a
towel
was
used
as
a
crude
silencer
i
never
heard
of
that
being
used
a
suicide
does
care
about
the
noise
he
wants
people
to
come
running
he
wants
it
to
be
dramatic
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
was
in
his
mouth
when
it
went
off
the
gun
was
new
a
rifle
right
out
of
stock
with
the
tag
still
wired
to
the
trigger
guard
there
were
nice
clean
prints
on
the
side
of
the
action
too
clean
they
were
george
of
course
there
were
no
prints
on
the
inside
doorknob
it
was
wiped
but
it
had
been
smeared
that
could
have
been
accidental
or
purposeful
many
suicides
are
naked
more
than
half
that
fits
buttons
had
been
ripped
off
his
shirt
maybe
he
was
in
a
hurry
maybe
somebody
undressed
him
in
a
hurry
there
was
a
bottle
on
the
floor
under
the
bed
half
full
of
liquor
george
left
very
clear
prints
on
that
i
interested
in
the
man
what
do
you
mean
steve
i
think
somebody
met
george
after
he
left
stump
i
talked
to
stump
george
was
nearly
helpless
he
carried
a
key
to
the
store
i
think
somebody
went
to
the
store
with
him
and
took
a
rifle
out
of
stock
i
think
he
slid
it
down
his
pant
leg
that
gave
him
a
walk
he
took
george
up
to
his
room
he
fed
him
more
liquor
when
he
passed
out
he
undressed
him
sat
him
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
wrapped
the
muzzle
opened
his
mouth
put
it
between
his
teeth
and
pulled
the
trigger
he
put
prints
on
the
gun
and
bottle
smeared
the
knob
and
left
steve
dammit
you
always
make
things
harder
strange
things
are
going
on
i
got
a
report
from
the
county
office
today
a
man
named
grassman
left
his
stuff
in
a
cabin
and
did
come
back
for
it
that
was
last
sunday
he
been
staying
there
a
couple
of
weeks
milton
grassman
from
chicago
the
county
police
found
stuff
in
the
cabin
to
indicate
he
worked
for
a
chicago
firm
of
investigators
and
was
down
here
on
that
fulton
thing
he
stayed
twenty
miles
north
of
town
on
the
redding
road
yesterday
a
car
was
towed
in
parking
a
routine
deal
blue
sedan
late
model
illinois
plates
just
before
i
came
here
i
found
out
the
registration
on
the
steering
post
is
to
this
grassman
all
right
now
grassman
has
disappeared
leaving
his
clothes
and
his
car
george
warden
dies
all
of
a
sudden
grassman
was
down
here
looking
into
the
disappearance
of
a
fulton
who
took
off
with
george
warden
wife
it
ties
up
somehow
i
want
to
know
how
if
we
can
tie
it
up
we
can
find
out
for
sure
if
it
was
suicide
or
murder
i
vote
for
murder
it
was
a
bold
way
to
do
it
and
a
dangerous
way
to
do
it
the
man
who
did
it
took
chances
but
i
think
he
did
it
was
it
grassman
was
it
that
man
over
there
who
claims
to
be
writing
a
book
who
was
it
and
why
was
it
done
marion
sighed
heavily
steve
i
could
never
get
it
through
my
head
why
you
take
off
so
ugly
on
those
men
who
came
down
to
poke
around
that
poor
fulton
woman
if
she
wants
to
spend
her
money
why
do
you
let
her
it
no
skin
off
us
i
do
want
my
judgment
or
the
result
of
any
investigation
of
mine
questioned
we
the
law
and
order
here
i
do
want
amateur
competition
sometimes
those
fellas
can
help
steve
i
have
yet
to
see
the
day
what
did
those
chicago
people
say
did
you
get
in
touch
no
well
you
phone
them
steve
or
teletype
chicago
and
let
them
handle
it
with
the
agency
those
fellows
may
want
to
send
somebody
else
down
why
for
god
sake
demanded
prine
losing
control
why
to
look
for
grassman
marion
said
mildly
missing
is
he
i
managed
to
walk
out
beside
ruth
she
was
cool
almost
to
the
point
of
complete
indifference
ruth
i
want
to
be
able
to
explain
some
time
i
do
think
it
worth
bothering
about
really
the
day
had
begun
to
clear
and
we
stood
in
frail
sunlight
i
do
know
why
i
should
worry
so
much
about
your
good
opinion
i
said
trying
to
strike
a
light
note
if
i
were
you
i
would
even
think
about
it
i
usually
frank
with
people
too
frank
as
you
will
remember
i
expect
others
to
be
the
same
i
usually
expect
too
much
i
usually
disappointed
i
getting
used
to
it
i
found
myself
becoming
annoyed
at
her
attitude
it
would
be
nice
for
you
to
get
used
to
it
it
would
make
it
easier
to
be
the
only
perfect
person
surrounded
by
all
the
rest
of
us
what
do
you
think
you
i
think
you
sounded
pretty
stuffy
that
all
you
make
a
lot
of
virtuous
noise
and
you
condemn
me
without
knowing
the
score
you
do
seem
exactly
eager
to
tell
me
the
score
we
stood
glaring
at
each
other
it
suddenly
tickled
her
sense
of
the
ridiculous
i
saw
her
struggle
to
keep
from
smiling
just
then
a
man
came
up
to
us
he
was
young
with
a
thin
face
and
heavy
glasses
hello
allan
ruth
said
allan
this
is
tal
howard
allan
peary
we
shook
hands
and
he
said
ruthie
i
just
heard
they
going
to
appoint
me
to
straighten
out
george
estate
what
there
is
left
of
it
do
you
happen
to
know
what
happened
to
the
household
effects
when
he
sold
to
syler
he
sold
everything
allan
allan
peary
shook
his
head
i
do
know
where
the
money
went
been
in
touch
with
the
bank
there
only
three
accounts
open
the
lumberyard
and
the
store
and
his
personal
account
and
damn
little
money
in
any
of
them
you
about
the
only
one
of
his
old
friends
who
saw
much
of
him
ruth
where
did
it
all
go
he
liquidated
an
awful
lot
of
stuff
in
the
past
year
what
the
hell
was
he
doing
playing
the
market
gambling
women
drugs
he
was
drinking
it
up
i
guess
oh
sure
allan
said
i
know
what
syler
paid
for
the
house
i
know
what
he
got
when
he
sold
the
lease
on
delaware
street
i
know
what
he
got
for
the
cement
trucks
if
he
did
touch
anything
but
napoleon
brandy
at
bucks
a
bottle
he
have
to
drink
a
thousand
bucks
a
week
worth
to
go
through
that
money
maybe
it
in
some
other
account
allan
i
doubt
it
he
looked
at
me
uneasily
and
said
i
do
want
to
talk
out
of
school
but
he
had
a
big
tab
at
stump
he
was
behind
on
the
room
at
the
hotel
and
i
heard
last
week
that
sid
forrester
had
a
exclusive
listing
on
the
lumberyard
and
had
an
interested
customer
lined
up
that
was
the
only
thing
george
had
left
that
was
making
any
money
maybe
when
you
go
over
his
accounts
you
can
find
what
he
wrote
checks
for
allan
that
is
going
to
work
either
he
wrote
checks
for
cash
and
cashed
them
at
the
bank
amounts
ranging
from
five
hundred
to
two
thousand
ruth
frowned
he
did
seem
worried
about
money
i
tried
to
talk
to
him
a
few
times
he
did
seem
worried
about
anything
he
did
seem
to
give
a
damn
about
anything
he
almost
seemed
to
be
enjoying
some
big
joke
on
himself
and
right
at
that
moment
something
became
very
clear
to
me
something
i
should
have
seen
before
i
wondered
why
i
had
been
so
dense
once
you
made
the
proper
assumption
a
lot
of
things
fell
into
their
proper
place
ten
i
realized
they
were
still
talking
but
i
was
no
longer
listening
to
what
they
said
then
i
realized
that
ruth
had
spoken
to
me
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
i
have
to
be
running
along
wait
a
minute
please
can
we
talk
for
a
minute
you
too
mr
peary
i
saw
that
she
was
holding
her
shoulders
as
if
she
were
chilled
the
sun
had
gone
under
again
and
a
raw
april
wind
was
blowing
we
could
sit
in
my
car
a
minute
i
want
to
make
a
guess
as
to
what
george
was
doing
with
the
money
they
looked
at
me
oddly
peary
shrugged
and
said
sure
we
crossed
the
street
and
got
into
my
car
ruth
in
the
middle
it
just
a
guess
you
know
that
rose
fulton
has
never
been
satisfied
with
her
husband
disappearance
prine
investigated
and
satisfied
george
was
out
of
town
when
eloise
ran
off
with
fulton
a
neighbor
saw
eloise
carry
a
bag
out
to
the
car
now
suppose
that
eloise
was
running
away
permanently
imagine
that
she
was
just
going
to
stay
the
night
with
fulton
she
did
want
to
stay
at
the
house
in
case
george
should
come
home
and
there
were
the
neighbors
to
consider
she
would
want
to
go
to
a
motel
or
hotel
in
the
area
she
was
too
well
known
so
she
planned
to
go
up
to
the
lake
with
fulton
she
took
just
the
things
she
need
for
overnight
was
it
the
time
of
year
when
there
would
be
people
up
at
the
lake
it
was
this
time
of
year
ruth
said
now
suppose
george
came
home
and
found
she
was
home
he
started
hunting
for
her
and
went
to
the
lake
or
imagine
that
for
some
reason
driving
back
from
his
trip
out
of
town
he
stopped
at
the
lake
and
found
them
there
together
what
would
he
have
done
i
see
where
this
is
heading
ruth
said
it
gives
me
a
strange
feeling
george
loved
eloise
and
trusted
her
i
guess
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
see
what
she
was
if
george
walked
in
on
the
two
of
them
i
think
he
would
have
gone
temporarily
insane
i
think
he
would
have
killed
them
he
used
to
be
a
powerful
man
tal
so
he
killed
them
up
there
at
the
lake
he
got
rid
of
the
bodies
he
could
have
wired
weights
to
the
bodies
and
sunk
them
in
the
lake
but
i
more
inclined
to
think
he
buried
them
maybe
he
buried
them
on
his
own
land
there
he
was
lucky
in
that
she
had
been
seen
at
the
inn
with
fulton
and
she
was
seen
leaving
with
fulton
he
had
no
way
to
know
it
would
work
out
so
well
he
killed
them
in
anger
and
buried
the
bodies
in
panic
for
a
long
time
he
was
safe
he
tried
to
go
on
as
though
nothing
had
happened
he
played
the
part
of
the
abandoned
husband
and
then
somebody
found
the
bodies
they
did
report
it
to
the
police
they
went
to
george
peary
said
eagerly
and
put
the
bite
on
him
they
demanded
money
and
kept
demanding
money
he
had
to
start
selling
things
when
nearly
everything
was
gone
he
killed
himself
he
could
face
exposure
and
trial
and
conviction
so
we
have
to
look
for
somebody
who
has
gotten
rich
all
of
a
sudden
or
somebody
smart
enough
to
just
put
it
away
and
not
attract
attention
by
spending
it
i
said
he
seemed
so
strange
sometimes
ruth
said
softly
he
said
queer
things
i
did
understand
he
was
like
one
of
those
bad
movies
where
people
laugh
at
the
wrong
places
it
would
be
quite
a
thing
to
have
on
your
mind
peary
said
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
logical
it
seems
howard
i
think
hit
it
right
on
the
head
the
next
step
is
to
prove
it
and
that
means
looking
for
the
bodies
i
i
like
to
hear
what
fulton
has
to
say
though
she
been
annoying
prine
by
sending
people
here
i
like
to
know
why
she
so
convinced
that
she
willing
to
spend
money
we
could
phone
her
i
said
if
you
could
get
her
address
he
got
out
of
the
car
i
think
i
can
get
it
i
be
back
in
a
minute
we
placed
the
call
from
peary
office
peary
talked
to
her
from
the
inner
office
ruth
and
i
listened
on
the
extension
her
ear
close
to
mine
the
woman
had
a
harsh
voice
how
do
you
come
into
this
i
do
really
george
warden
committed
suicide
last
night
it
gives
us
a
lead
to
what
might
have
happened
to
your
husband
he
was
killed
and
he
was
killed
down
there
maybe
that
woman
did
it
i
do
know
now
i
hear
that
man
grassman
is
missing
i
talked
to
him
before
he
went
down
there
when
are
you
people
going
to
wake
up
down
there
what
kind
of
a
place
is
that
anyhow
what
makes
you
think
your
husband
is
dead
henry
was
no
damn
good
he
chase
anything
in
a
skirt
i
knew
it
that
was
the
way
he
was
he
always
come
crawling
back
he
even
liked
crawling
i
think
this
business
with
that
warden
woman
was
more
of
the
same
it
would
last
any
two
years
he
had
fourteen
hundred
dollars
in
his
personal
checking
account
that
all
tied
up
never
drawn
on
it
he
owed
payments
on
the
car
the
finance
company
has
never
been
able
to
find
the
car
we
got
two
kids
in
high
school
i
say
this
for
him
he
loved
the
kids
he
could
go
two
years
without
seeing
them
not
henry
personally
believe
me
i
convinced
i
never
see
him
again
and
i
do
care
but
he
had
a
couple
of
big
insurance
policies
i
insisted
on
that
to
protect
me
and
the
kids
what
protection
have
i
got
the
companies
wo
pay
off
it
has
to
be
six
years
from
the
time
he
dropped
off
the
face
of
the
earth
four
more
years
i
have
to
get
along
what
about
college
for
the
kids
i
tell
you
you
people
better
wake
up
down
there
and
find
out
what
happened
to
henry
there
was
more
but
she
merely
repeated
herself
the
conversation
ended
i
hung
up
and
looked
at
ruth
her
smile
was
wan
and
she
shivered
a
little
that
was
pretty
convincing
tal
she
said
very
peary
came
into
the
outer
office
he
looked
thoughtful
suppose
i
was
the
blackmailer
i
find
the
bodies
i
came
across
them
by
accident
or
maybe
i
was
smart
enough
to
look
for
them
okay
what
do
i
do
i
make
damn
well
certain
that
nobody
else
finds
them
and
spoils
the
game
i
want
to
do
a
better
job
of
hiding
them
than
george
did
but
i
want
to
completely
dispose
of
the
bodies
i
want
them
where
they
can
be
a
threat
i
want
them
where
they
can
be
dug
up
ruth
said
that
man
grassman
we
saw
him
out
at
the
lake
tal
and
i
did
and
now
he
disappeared
that
could
mean
that
he
found
the
bodies
and
found
the
blackmailer
too
peary
said
i
found
myself
remembering
the
odd
conversation
with
george
when
he
had
said
he
could
give
me
a
job
and
had
offered
me
a
gun
out
of
stock
he
had
known
i
had
come
from
fitz
he
had
thought
i
was
a
friend
of
fitz
cutting
myself
in
on
the
take
it
was
obvious
that
fitz
was
the
blackmailer
i
remembered
the
expensive
look
of
the
suit
he
was
wearing
when
i
had
seen
him
at
the
inn
he
had
come
to
hillston
with
the
idea
of
finding
the
money
timmy
had
hidden
he
had
stayed
in
the
cabin
out
at
the
lake
he
made
a
point
of
telling
me
that
the
money
was
hidden
out
at
the
lake
he
had
looked
there
and
found
something
profitable
and
horrible
but
what
was
most
convincing
was
fitz
telling
me
that
he
was
certain
eloise
had
taken
the
money
with
her
he
must
have
appreciated
his
own
joke
eloise
had
never
meant
to
leave
permanently
she
would
have
been
a
fool
to
leave
as
long
as
there
was
a
chance
of
timmy
coming
back
she
knew
about
the
money
yet
timmy
had
been
shrewd
enough
not
to
trust
her
with
information
about
the
hiding
place
i
thought
of
that
first
conversation
that
must
have
taken
place
between
fitz
and
george
after
fitz
found
the
bodies
what
should
we
do
ruth
asked
should
we
talk
to
captain
marion
at
that
gray
wednesday
i
stood
on
the
lake
shore
with
ruth
and
allan
peary
sergeant
brubaker
and
lieutenant
prine
we
were
in
front
of
the
place
that
had
belonged
to
george
warden
before
he
had
sold
it
the
narrow
dock
had
been
hauled
out
onto
the
shore
for
the
winter
and
had
been
replaced
the
wind
had
died
and
the
lake
was
like
a
gray
steel
plate
voices
had
an
odd
resonance
in
the
stillness
captain
marion
came
out
of
the
cabin
with
a
husky
young
patrolman
the
patrolman
had
changed
to
swimming
trunks
he
wore
an
aqualung
with
the
face
mask
shoved
up
onto
his
forehead
he
walked
gingerly
on
the
rough
path
in
his
bare
feet
he
looked
serious
and
chilled
captain
marion
said
try
to
stay
on
this
line
right
here
the
water
looks
kind
of
murky
how
the
light
the
patrolman
clicked
the
watertight
flashlight
on
it
looks
bright
enough
prine
said
in
a
low
voice
so
captain
marion
could
overhear
this
is
nonsense
no
one
answered
him
brubaker
moved
away
from
us
i
glanced
down
at
ruth
face
her
lips
were
compressed
she
watched
the
patrolman
wade
out
into
the
water
it
shelved
off
abruptly
he
thrashed
and
caught
his
balance
the
water
up
to
his
chest
he
adjusted
the
face
mask
bit
down
on
the
mouthpiece
he
glanced
toward
us
then
moved
forward
and
was
gone
leaving
a
swirl
of
turbulence
on
the
surface
the
ripples
spread
out
died
away
prine
lit
a
cigarette
threw
the
match
aside
with
a
quick
impatient
gesture
he
had
looked
tall
when
i
had
seen
him
behind
his
desk
standing
beside
me
he
was
not
tall
at
all
his
trunk
was
very
long
but
his
legs
were
short
and
heavy
the
long
minutes
passed
we
made
idle
talk
but
we
kept
our
voices
low
the
pines
on
far
hills
looked
black
the
man
came
abruptly
to
the
surface
about
forty
feet
off
shore
he
swam
to
the
shore
and
waded
out
of
the
water
dripping
he
pushed
the
face
mask
up
onto
his
forehead
he
was
shivering
man
it
cold
down
there
he
said
we
moved
toward
him
well
marion
demanded
here
sir
he
handed
marion
something
we
looked
at
it
as
it
lay
on
marion
hand
it
was
the
dash
lighter
out
of
an
automobile
corroded
and
stained
i
came
right
up
from
where
it
is
it
in
about
fifty
feet
of
water
half
on
its
side
gray
studebaker
illinois
plates
the
number
is
empty
rock
bottom
it
on
a
pretty
steep
slope
i
think
it
can
be
hauled
out
all
right
that
number
checks
out
prine
said
in
a
reluctant
voice
damn
it
how
can
you
figure
a
thing
like
that
steve
marion
said
i
guess
maybe
we
goofed
on
this
one
i
guess
maybe
that
rose
fulton
was
right
ruth
had
gone
back
to
town
with
peary
in
his
car
she
had
seemed
subdued
thoughtful
as
peary
had
credited
me
with
making
the
guess
that
led
to
the
discovery
of
the
car
i
was
in
marion
good
graces
i
had
not
told
them
the
second
installment
of
the
guess
no
longer
a
guess
actually
that
fitzmartin
was
the
blackmailer
the
tow
truck
had
arrived
it
stood
heading
away
from
the
water
brakes
locked
and
wheels
blocked
the
taut
cable
stretched
down
into
the
water
at
dusk
they
had
turned
on
the
big
spotlights
on
the
tow
truck
about
twenty
people
watched
from
a
place
just
down
the
lake
shore
captain
marion
had
herded
them
down
there
out
of
the
way
more
men
had
come
out
from
town
they
had
been
searching
the
area
prodding
into
the
soft
earth
with
long
steel
rods
the
tired
patrolman
surfaced
again
and
came
to
shore
it
ought
to
do
it
this
time
he
said
i
got
the
hook
around
the
rear
axle
and
fastened
back
on
the
cable
he
stood
in
the
light
he
had
scratched
his
arm
on
a
rock
there
was
a
sheen
of
blood
on
his
forearm
try
her
again
marion
called
the
winch
began
to
whine
again
the
cable
tightened
visibly
i
watched
the
drum
the
cable
began
to
come
in
a
few
feet
at
a
time
the
progress
was
uneven
at
last
like
some
surfacing
sea
monster
the
gray
back
of
the
car
emerged
from
the
water
the
car
was
resting
on
its
wheels
it
came
backward
out
of
the
water
streaming
bright
metal
showed
where
it
had
been
dragged
against
rocks
the
big
truck
moved
forward
until
the
car
was
entirely
on
dry
land
water
ran
out
of
the
car
runneling
back
into
the
lake
there
was
a
smell
of
dampness
and
weed
get
yourself
dried
off
ben
marion
said
quietly
george
open
up
that
back
end
with
a
pry
bar
the
cold
weary
underwater
swimmer
went
up
to
the
cabin
a
stocky
man
in
uniform
opened
the
trunk
expertly
the
county
police
who
had
arrived
moved
closer
i
could
hear
the
spectators
talking
excitedly
to
each
other
the
floodlights
illuminated
the
interior
of
the
trunk
compartment
brightly
there
was
drenched
luggage
in
there
sodden
clothing
water
was
still
running
out
of
the
trunk
marion
said
well
that
one
place
they
ai
did
expect
them
to
be
tight
fit
for
two
of
them
but
you
can
see
how
it
was
those
shirts
and
socks
that
stuff
would
jump
out
of
the
suitcase
he
found
them
after
he
killed
them
he
just
dumped
their
stuff
in
the
back
end
loose
like
then
he
aimed
the
car
at
the
slope
and
started
it
up
it
would
be
night
and
he
would
have
the
car
lights
on
because
that
would
attract
attention
she
got
going
pretty
good
he
knew
it
was
deep
right
off
here
hitting
the
water
probably
slowed
it
a
lot
but
once
on
the
bottom
it
would
keep
right
on
going
down
the
underwater
slope
until
it
wedged
in
those
rocks
where
ben
found
it
i
could
see
a
woman
red
plastic
purse
in
the
back
end
the
red
had
stayed
bright
it
looked
new
enough
to
have
been
carried
by
eloise
yesterday
captain
marion
reached
in
and
took
it
out
he
unsnapped
it
and
poured
the
water
out
of
it
a
corroded
lipstick
fell
to
the
ground
marion
grunted
as
he
bent
over
and
picked
it
up
there
was
a
wallet
in
the
purse
he
took
it
out
and
shook
the
water
off
it
and
opened
it
he
studied
the
soaked
cards
mrs
warden
all
right
al
can
you
tow
the
car
on
into
town
all
right
sure
captain
well
when
you
get
there
spread
all
this
stuff
out
in
the
back
end
of
the
garage
where
it
get
a
chance
to
dry
off
in
ten
minutes
the
car
had
been
lashed
securely
and
towed
off
i
heard
the
tow
truck
motor
labor
as
it
went
up
the
hill
toward
the
road
captain
prine
said
shall
i
have
the
men
keep
looking
it
getting
too
dark
to
do
much
good
they
have
had
any
luck
might
as
well
save
it
until
morning
tom
can
you
detail
some
of
your
boys
to
help
out
in
the
morning
i
can
send
a
couple
around
the
spectators
had
gone
most
of
them
a
wiry
little
man
came
over
to
where
we
stood
the
swimmer
back
in
uniform
had
come
down
from
the
cabin
i
could
smell
a
strong
reek
of
liquor
on
his
breath
somebody
had
evidently
found
a
cold
preventative
for
him
prine
said
to
the
elderly
little
man
i
told
you
people
to
stay
back
there
do
you
bark
and
show
your
teeth
at
me
boy
i
want
to
talk
to
you
fellows
maybe
you
might
learn
something
get
off
the
hold
it
steve
captain
marion
said
in
a
mild
voice
what
your
name
finister
bert
finister
looking
for
bodies
somebody
said
what
you
doing
you
could
listen
to
me
i
live
off
back
there
other
side
of
the
road
i
do
chores
around
here
most
of
the
camps
everybody
knows
me
carpentry
work
plumbing
masonry
put
the
docks
in
take
out
in
the
fall
i
know
these
camps
so
you
know
the
camps
if
you
were
hunting
for
bodies
finister
where
would
you
look
i
getting
to
that
i
know
the
camps
i
know
the
people
that
come
stay
in
them
knew
george
and
timmy
warden
and
their
pa
knew
that
eloise
too
knew
when
timmy
used
to
come
up
and
swim
all
the
way
across
to
see
ruthie
stamm
showing
off
i
guess
then
last
year
there
was
a
fellow
named
fitzmartin
up
here
guess
he
rented
this
place
from
george
first
time
it
was
ever
rented
and
now
it
been
sold
but
that
beside
the
point
you
know
there
all
this
stuff
these
days
takes
the
bread
out
of
a
man
mouth
takes
honest
work
away
from
him
people
do
things
theirself
they
botch
it
all
up
me
i
take
it
like
an
insult
that
fitzmartin
he
was
digging
around
did
know
what
he
was
doing
i
figured
whatever
he
was
doing
it
was
something
he
could
hire
me
to
do
then
by
god
he
trucks
in
cement
and
he
knocks
together
some
forms
and
i
be
damned
if
he
does
cement
the
garage
floor
pretty
fair
job
for
an
amateur
but
it
was
taking
bread
out
of
my
mouth
so
i
remember
it
he
put
that
floor
in
last
may
if
i
was
looking
for
any
bodies
i
look
under
that
floor
because
that
fitzmartin
he
a
man
i
come
around
to
help
and
he
chases
me
clean
off
the
place
walks
me
all
the
way
up
to
the
road
with
my
arm
twist
up
behind
me
and
calls
me
a
trespasser
nobody
ever
called
me
that
before
folks
are
friendly
up
here
that
man
he
just
did
fit
in
at
all
and
i
glad
he
was
the
one
who
bought
it
the
folks
who
bought
it
people
from
redding
they
seem
nice
got
two
little
kids
i
let
them
know
when
they
want
anything
done
they
get
hold
of
bert
finister
we
stood
in
the
glow
of
car
lights
captain
marion
looked
at
prine
fitzmartin
runs
the
lumberyard
for
george
shall
i
go
get
him
we
better
look
first
steve
that
cement
floor
fooled
me
i
went
over
it
carefully
it
had
been
dug
up
and
patched
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
the
whole
floor
had
been
i
saw
a
pickax
in
the
shed
captain
marion
said
maybe
you
better
swing
it
yourself
steve
maybe
you
need
the
workout
yes
sir
said
a
subdued
lieutenant
prine
they
parked
the
cars
so
that
the
headlights
made
the
inside
of
the
garage
as
bright
as
a
stage
prine
swung
and
grunted
and
sweated
until
captain
marion
decided
the
punishment
was
enough
finister
came
back
out
of
the
darkness
with
another
pick
and
a
massive
crowbar
the
work
began
to
go
faster
a
big
slab
was
loosened
they
pried
it
up
heaved
it
over
out
of
the
way
exposing
black
dirt
the
men
worked
silently
for
a
long
time
it
did
appear
that
they
would
get
anywhere
i
was
out
in
the
darkness
having
a
cigarette
when
i
heard
someone
say
sharply
hold
it
i
started
toward
the
garage
and
then
thought
of
what
they
might
find
and
stopped
where
i
was
the
one
called
ben
came
out
into
the
night
he
bent
forward
from
the
waist
and
gagged
dryly
he
stood
up
and
coughed
find
them
i
asked
they
found
them
prine
says
it
her
he
remembers
the
color
of
her
hair
i
rode
back
in
with
captain
marion
prine
had
gone
on
ahead
to
pick
up
fitzmartin
captain
marion
felt
talkative
it
is
going
to
be
too
easy
with
this
fitzmartin
what
can
we
prove
that
will
stand
up
blackmail
we
have
to
have
the
money
and
testimony
concealing
the
evidence
of
a
crime
he
can
say
george
told
him
to
put
a
cement
floor
in
the
garage
he
can
say
he
did
have
any
idea
what
was
under
it
no
it
is
going
to
be
as
easy
as
steve
thinks
it
is
sometimes
steve
worries
me
he
gets
so
damn
set
in
his
mind
he
is
flexible
enough
but
you
think
it
was
fitzmartin
it
has
to
be
he
milked
george
clean
dry
george
did
have
much
choice
i
guess
pay
up
or
be
exposed
if
he
was
exposed
my
guess
is
he
would
have
gotten
life
a
good
defense
attorney
could
have
brought
out
some
things
about
eloise
that
would
sound
very
pretty
to
a
jury
george
could
have
figured
that
when
he
ran
out
of
money
fitzmartin
might
probably
would
take
off
without
saying
a
word
that
would
leave
him
free
to
walk
around
broke
better
than
not
walking
around
at
all
what
i
ca
figure
is
how
fitzmartin
got
it
in
his
head
to
look
for
those
bodies
he
was
in
this
town
when
george
killed
the
pair
of
them
i
understand
he
was
in
prison
camp
with
timmy
but
how
would
timmy
have
any
idea
about
a
thing
like
that
there
some
angles
to
this
we
wo
know
unless
that
fitzmartin
wants
to
talk
i
could
sense
the
way
his
mind
was
turning
he
glanced
at
me
a
couple
of
times
you
gave
us
some
help
howard
i
grant
that
but
i
do
feel
right
about
the
way
you
fit
in
either
what
do
you
mean
captain
are
you
just
a
little
too
damn
convenient
you
hit
town
and
everything
starts
to
pop
open
why
is
that
coincidence
i
guess
you
knew
timmy
and
you
know
fitzmartin
maybe
before
you
came
here
you
knew
fitzmartin
was
milking
george
maybe
that
why
you
came
here
howard
i
did
know
anything
about
it
i
not
through
with
you
son
do
take
yourself
any
notion
to
disappear
i
want
you
where
we
can
talk
some
more
you
just
too
damn
convenient
in
this
whole
thing
at
that
moment
about
a
mile
from
the
hillston
city
limits
a
call
came
over
the
radio
marion
answered
it
i
could
barely
decipher
donald
duck
voice
over
the
small
speaker
he
gone
captain
fitzmartin
is
gone
i
put
out
a
description
of
him
and
his
car
he
was
living
in
a
shed
at
the
rear
of
the
lumberyard
all
his
personal
stuff
is
gone
i
felt
the
space
heater
there
was
a
little
warmth
left
he
did
leave
too
long
ago
how
about
road
blocks
damn
it
steve
i
told
you
before
road
blocks
are
worth
a
damn
around
here
there
too
many
roads
there
just
are
enough
men
and
vehicles
in
this
area
to
close
all
those
roads
that
stove
could
have
been
turned
off
three
hours
ago
you
have
to
have
your
blocks
set
up
right
now
this
minute
on
every
road
within
a
hundred
miles
at
least
what
do
you
suggest
sir
prine
said
more
humbly
wait
and
see
if
somebody
picks
him
up
marion
broke
the
connection
okay
howard
you
seem
to
know
fitzmartin
pretty
well
where
does
he
come
from
originally
from
texas
i
think
what
his
line
of
work
i
think
he
worked
in
oil
fields
ever
say
anything
about
his
relatives
he
never
talked
very
much
that
not
much
help
i
guess
where
can
we
drop
you
off
my
car
parked
across
the
street
from
peary
office
want
to
tell
you
that
i
appreciate
you
making
a
pretty
good
guess
about
this
whole
thing
howard
i
ca
help
telling
you
i
wonder
just
how
much
of
it
was
guessing
and
i
wonder
why
you
came
here
i
like
it
if
you
play
the
cards
face
up
i
had
thought
him
amiable
mild
ineffectual
hour
by
hour
i
had
revised
my
opinion
i
had
thought
prine
was
the
dangerous
one
prine
was
the
fool
captain
marion
was
something
else
entirely
i
not
hiding
anything
captain
we
got
george
dead
and
that
grassman
missing
and
we
got
those
two
bodies
and
now
fitzmartin
on
the
run
it
has
to
get
tied
together
a
little
better
before
i
feel
right
about
it
i
sorry
i
ca
help
you
i
sorry
you
wo
help
son
good
night
they
drove
away
it
was
after
ten
and
i
was
famished
in
twelve
hours
i
would
be
picking
antoinette
up
with
luck
in
hours
i
would
be
gone
either
with
her
or
alone
i
did
know
which
it
would
be
call
it
a
form
of
monomania
i
had
thought
about
the
money
for
too
long
i
had
aimed
toward
it
for
too
long
tomorrow
i
would
have
it
once
i
had
it
maybe
i
could
begin
to
think
clearly
again
i
found
a
place
to
eat
i
was
just
finishing
when
brubaker
came
in
he
sat
beside
me
at
the
counter
and
gloomily
flipped
the
menu
open
a
hell
of
a
long
day
he
said
it
has
been
and
not
over
yet
at
least
they
giving
me
time
to
eat
and
then
back
on
the
job
until
god
knows
when
nobody
will
get
any
sleep
tonight
i
thought
captain
marion
said
he
just
wait
and
hope
fitzmartin
gets
picked
up
that
right
i
mean
about
the
girl
i
suddenly
felt
very
cold
what
girl
i
thought
you
knew
about
that
the
stamm
girl
peary
brought
her
back
to
town
he
left
her
off
at
her
car
they
found
her
car
parked
on
north
delaware
and
nobody
seen
her
since
her
old
man
is
fit
to
be
tied
everybody
is
running
around
in
circles
i
could
finish
the
little
bit
of
food
that
was
left
i
drink
the
rest
of
my
coffee
it
was
as
though
my
throat
had
closed
i
wondered
how
soon
they
add
two
and
two
ruth
had
been
subdued
and
thoughtful
when
she
left
the
lake
she
would
remember
that
fitzmartin
had
acted
strangely
she
was
the
sort
of
person
to
do
her
own
investigating
she
was
the
sort
of
person
who
would
go
and
talk
to
fitzmartin
she
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
he
was
a
killer
she
would
underestimate
his
cleverness
it
would
take
him
long
to
learn
that
the
car
had
been
found
to
learn
that
they
were
searching
the
area
of
the
lake
cabin
it
was
time
to
go
the
string
was
running
out
i
could
guess
how
it
had
happened
with
grassman
grassman
as
a
result
of
his
quiet
investigation
had
made
some
sound
guesses
as
to
what
had
happened
he
had
paid
a
call
on
fitzmartin
maybe
grassman
had
wanted
to
cut
himself
in
maybe
he
had
made
a
search
of
the
place
where
fitzmartin
lived
while
he
was
out
he
could
have
found
the
large
sum
of
money
fitz
had
extorted
from
george
warden
fitz
could
have
found
him
there
and
killed
him
driven
the
body
into
town
and
put
it
in
my
car
from
the
violence
of
the
blow
that
had
killed
grassman
it
could
be
assumed
that
it
was
an
unpremeditated
killing
in
the
moment
he
killed
grassman
fitz
became
more
deeply
involved
he
waited
expecting
me
to
be
jailed
for
the
grassman
murder
when
i
was
he
would
know
that
i
had
successfully
gotten
rid
of
the
body
no
one
had
spotted
it
in
my
car
thus
when
it
was
found
it
could
as
readily
be
traced
back
to
him
as
to
me
assuming
he
could
be
questioned
about
grassman
then
george
became
the
weak
link
george
by
talking
could
disclose
fitz
motive
for
the
grassman
murder
and
so
george
had
to
die
fitz
had
killed
him
boldly
taking
his
risk
and
getting
away
with
it
prine
had
been
right
about
the
towel
just
when
he
thinks
everything
has
been
taken
care
of
ruth
stamm
arrives
he
ca
leave
without
her
immediately
spreading
the
alarm
he
needs
a
grace
period
time
enough
to
get
far
away
before
someone
else
makes
the
same
guess
she
has
made
that
left
him
with
a
choice
he
could
tie
her
up
and
leave
her
there
but
that
would
be
too
clear
an
admission
of
guilt
he
could
take
her
with
him
that
would
be
awkward
and
risky
or
he
could
kill
her
one
more
death
would
make
any
difference
in
the
final
penalty
you
doing
a
lot
of
sweating
brubaker
said
it
is
that
hot
in
here
i
managed
a
feeble
smile
i
said
i
would
see
him
around
i
paid
and
left
it
was
too
easy
to
visualize
her
dead
with
raw
new
lumber
stacked
over
her
body
her
dark
red
hair
against
the
damp
ground
in
the
coolness
of
the
night
what
shocked
me
was
the
stunning
sense
of
loss
it
taught
me
that
i
had
underestimated
what
she
meant
to
me
i
could
not
understand
how
she
had
come
to
mean
so
much
in
so
short
a
time
more
than
charlotte
had
ever
meant
eleven
i
went
directly
to
police
headquarters
i
demanded
to
see
captain
marion
after
fifteen
minutes
they
let
me
see
him
i
told
him
that
i
thought
ruth
disappearance
had
something
to
do
with
fitzmartin
he
looked
older
and
tireder
he
nodded
without
surprise
he
said
she
knew
george
pretty
well
maybe
she
remembered
something
george
said
about
fitzmartin
so
she
tried
to
check
it
out
herself
maybe
he
think
she
was
the
only
one
who
guess
i
thought
of
that
howard
i
do
like
it
i
got
a
crew
out
there
searching
the
yard
i
thought
of
something
else
too
maybe
grassman
guessed
maybe
that
why
something
happened
to
him
thanks
for
coming
in
howard
i
added
it
up
about
a
half
hour
ago
i
do
like
the
total
can
i
help
in
any
way
you
look
like
hell
you
better
try
to
get
some
sleep
i
do
think
i
be
able
to
sleep
i
drove
back
out
to
the
motel
it
no
longer
seemed
important
about
meeting
antoinette
in
the
morning
it
did
matter
any
more
i
had
come
here
to
hillston
to
find
treasure
i
had
thought
i
would
find
it
buried
in
the
ground
i
had
found
it
walking
around
with
dark
red
hair
with
gray
eyes
with
a
look
of
pride
and
i
had
recognized
it
i
had
acted
like
a
fool
i
had
tried
to
play
the
role
of
thief
but
it
did
fit
it
never
would
fit
the
money
meant
nothing
ruth
meant
everything
i
had
had
a
chance
and
i
had
lost
it
they
do
give
you
two
chances
i
parked
in
front
of
my
motel
room
the
office
was
dark
the
sign
lighted
cars
sat
in
the
light
of
an
uneasy
moon
and
the
travelers
slept
i
unlocked
the
door
with
my
key
and
stepped
inside
reaching
for
the
light
switch
something
came
out
of
the
darkness
and
slammed
against
my
jaw
pain
blossomed
red
behind
my
eyes
a
skyrocket
roaring
was
in
my
ears
and
i
felt
myself
fall
into
nothingness
i
came
to
in
a
brightly
lighted
place
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
nothing
but
the
white
glare
and
closed
them
quickly
the
white
glare
hurt
my
hands
were
behind
me
fastened
there
somehow
i
was
in
an
awkward
position
something
soft
filled
my
mouth
holding
it
open
i
opened
my
eyes
again
squinting
i
saw
that
i
was
in
the
small
tile
bathroom
of
the
motel
the
door
was
closed
i
lay
on
my
side
on
the
floor
earl
fitzmartin
sat
on
the
side
of
the
tub
he
wore
khakis
he
looked
at
me
with
those
eyes
like
smoke
his
pale
colorless
hair
was
tousled
i
could
sense
at
once
that
he
had
gone
beyond
the
vague
borderline
of
sanity
it
was
like
being
in
a
cage
with
an
animal
he
stood
up
closed
the
lid
on
the
toilet
bent
over
me
picked
me
up
with
disconcerting
ease
and
sat
me
on
the
closed
lid
holding
me
for
a
moment
until
he
was
certain
i
would
topple
over
he
sat
on
the
rim
of
the
tub
again
facing
me
we
are
going
to
talk
over
a
whisper
tal
we
are
going
to
make
any
sudden
noises
if
we
make
any
sudden
noises
i
going
to
snap
your
neck
with
my
hands
it
would
be
hard
to
do
nod
your
head
if
going
to
be
quiet
i
nodded
he
took
a
knife
out
of
his
pocket
opened
the
blade
and
leaned
toward
me
he
put
the
cold
steel
against
my
cheek
holding
it
there
smiling
in
an
odd
way
then
yanked
it
toward
him
cutting
the
strip
of
sheeting
that
held
the
dry
washcloth
in
my
mouth
i
pushed
the
washcloth
out
with
my
tongue
and
it
fell
to
the
floor
at
my
feet
where
ruth
that
was
just
a
little
bit
too
loud
not
much
too
loud
just
a
little
bit
so
soften
it
up
tal
ruth
is
all
right
thank
god
not
god
me
i
had
the
idea
not
god
she
was
on
the
ground
on
her
face
out
like
a
light
i
took
hold
of
that
wonderful
hair
in
my
left
hand
and
i
pulled
her
head
up
i
held
this
little
knife
against
her
throat
it
sharp
enough
to
shave
with
i
was
about
to
pull
it
through
her
throat
when
i
suddenly
began
to
wonder
if
she
might
be
worth
something
so
i
did
do
it
she
all
right
do
thank
god
thank
earl
fitzmartin
she
is
comfortable
she
is
happy
but
still
alive
tal
where
is
she
not
over
a
half
mile
from
here
but
you
do
know
what
direction
it
across
country
i
was
trained
to
fight
at
night
i
move
well
at
night
tal
i
good
at
night
you
know
how
i
used
to
get
around
the
camp
you
remember
that
she
well
tied
tal
she
ca
even
wiggle
she
ca
make
a
sound
you
really
worried
about
her
are
you
she
came
to
the
yard
for
a
little
talk
did
they
find
the
bodies
tal
they
tore
up
the
garage
floor
now
they
can
ask
george
all
about
it
but
george
wo
have
a
word
to
say
george
is
talking
george
did
have
much
more
left
just
a
little
equity
in
the
lumberyard
a
little
stock
in
the
store
not
enough
left
to
stay
around
for
he
was
good
for
thousand
seven
hundred
dollars
it
should
have
been
more
he
did
have
to
give
up
he
could
have
gotten
on
the
ball
and
started
making
more
he
could
have
tried
to
fatten
up
the
kitty
but
he
was
selfish
he
would
have
lived
longer
you
killed
him
that
was
a
shade
too
loud
tal
just
a
bit
too
loud
how
are
you
coming
with
cindy
tal
find
her
you
took
an
awful
chance
killing
george
he
smiled
again
you
wo
believe
this
but
i
did
kill
him
he
started
to
come
to
while
i
was
stripping
him
but
i
poured
more
liquor
into
him
i
read
that
people
drown
themselves
and
shoot
themselves
and
cut
their
wrists
naked
did
you
know
that
very
interesting
i
got
him
propped
on
the
side
of
the
bed
i
got
the
muzzle
with
the
towel
around
it
between
his
teeth
the
gun
was
about
the
only
thing
holding
him
up
i
wanted
the
angle
to
be
right
and
i
wanted
to
do
it
when
there
was
a
lot
of
noise
on
the
floor
but
i
wanted
to
do
it
tal
you
know
you
plan
a
thing
and
work
it
out
just
right
you
want
to
do
it
but
he
opened
his
eyes
he
looked
right
at
me
he
looked
ridiculous
with
the
gun
in
his
mouth
he
looked
right
at
me
and
put
his
big
toe
against
the
trigger
before
i
could
stop
him
i
do
know
if
it
was
an
accident
what
do
you
think
i
think
he
did
it
on
purpose
so
do
i
so
do
i
it
makes
me
feel
a
little
strange
he
maybe
did
it
like
a
joke
he
did
that
well
he
did
do
much
else
well
he
do
well
marrying
that
woman
or
burying
her
either
i
thought
i
hit
the
sixty
thousand
when
i
dug
under
the
pines
but
it
turned
out
to
be
the
woman
and
the
salesman
it
disappointed
me
tal
but
it
turned
out
to
be
just
like
finding
money
did
it
they
all
after
you
now
do
you
think
that
worries
me
now
hear
this
it
does
worry
me
a
bit
maybe
you
ought
to
be
worried
where
is
grassman
i
did
think
you
could
get
out
of
that
you
surprised
me
a
little
tal
i
thought
it
would
give
you
the
jumps
what
did
you
do
with
it
i
hid
the
body
in
a
barn
an
abandoned
barn
and
i
bet
you
did
some
sweating
grassman
was
smart
he
was
in
my
league
tal
not
yours
he
added
things
up
he
was
a
pro
he
added
things
up
and
came
after
the
money
he
knew
i
had
to
have
it
around
somewhere
he
knew
i
was
too
smart
to
spend
it
i
caught
him
looking
for
it
we
had
a
little
talk
he
got
rough
i
got
mad
and
hit
him
too
hard
that
made
it
awkward
i
put
him
in
the
back
end
of
my
car
i
did
know
where
to
dump
him
i
was
thinking
of
an
alley
so
think
he
been
mugged
but
i
found
your
car
by
accident
it
saved
me
a
lot
of
time
after
i
killed
grassman
i
knew
i
had
to
get
george
out
of
the
way
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
tie
me
to
grassman
it
took
some
planning
and
some
luck
i
wo
have
time
to
work
on
the
cindy
angle
how
are
you
coming
i
could
see
the
shape
of
it
george
could
tie
him
to
grassman
and
george
was
dead
i
could
tie
him
to
both
of
them
it
was
only
through
his
greed
that
i
could
buy
time
buy
my
life
i
found
her
he
waited
ten
seconds
he
said
a
hundred
and
seven
thousand
sounds
better
than
i
think
i
better
have
that
much
before
i
take
off
tal
they
going
to
get
you
i
do
think
so
i
do
figure
it
that
way
they
might
have
got
me
if
i
cut
her
throat
i
wanted
to
but
i
did
let
myself
they
would
have
hunted
me
too
hard
now
you
can
trade
information
for
her
tal
if
she
does
mean
anything
to
you
too
bad
i
can
kill
you
right
here
and
go
and
kill
her
and
be
on
my
way
and
be
careful
and
take
my
chances
i
could
leave
you
here
telling
them
about
george
and
grassman
and
then
finding
my
sixty
thousand
i
rather
nobody
found
it
somebody
is
going
to
find
it
anyway
the
girl
is
going
to
find
it
she
knows
where
it
is
where
is
it
tal
she
would
tell
me
i
told
her
too
much
i
could
find
out
any
other
way
she
more
in
your
league
fitz
i
picking
her
up
tomorrow
morning
in
redding
at
ten
she
going
to
go
with
me
to
where
the
money
is
hidden
he
smiled
in
that
wild
unpleasant
way
you
kidding
the
troops
boy
you
stalling
i
scared
you
and
you
making
things
up
just
smart
enough
to
know
that
if
you
are
going
to
get
it
tomorrow
and
yet
you
do
know
where
it
is
i
got
to
leave
you
alive
that
smart
and
that
why
you
made
it
up
it
the
truth
i
do
think
it
the
truth
at
all
i
think
maybe
you
have
gotten
any
place
i
think
i
stalled
around
here
too
long
i
think
i
like
to
hear
your
neck
snap
i
can
do
it
so
quick
you
hardly
know
it
happened
maybe
you
wo
know
it
at
all
wait
a
minute
look
in
the
closet
in
the
bedroom
her
luggage
is
there
for
the
first
time
he
looked
uncertain
he
turned
out
the
bathroom
light
and
went
into
the
next
room
he
came
back
with
the
two
suitcases
he
shut
the
door
turned
the
light
on
again
he
opened
them
and
looked
at
the
clothing
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
this
belongs
to
her
what
it
doing
here
we
were
going
to
get
the
money
and
go
off
together
i
could
see
him
appraise
that
and
half
accept
it
but
i
do
like
the
idea
of
letting
you
go
and
get
it
i
ca
keep
an
eye
on
you
fitz
listen
to
me
i
do
give
a
damn
about
the
money
you
can
have
every
cent
of
it
after
i
get
it
i
trade
all
of
it
for
ruth
stamm
then
see
how
it
will
be
you
have
the
hundred
and
seven
thousand
they
think
george
was
a
suicide
maybe
they
never
find
grassman
i
covered
the
body
with
hay
the
barn
is
about
to
fall
down
nobody
ever
goes
in
there
they
wo
look
as
hard
for
you
you
be
a
lot
safer
you
lying
this
is
a
stall
it
not
i
prove
we
were
going
to
go
away
together
when
we
got
the
money
look
for
the
small
black
box
in
the
bottom
of
the
smaller
suitcase
under
all
the
clothes
yes
that
it
look
under
the
partition
he
took
the
money
out
he
riffled
through
it
he
folded
it
once
and
put
it
in
his
shirt
pocket
he
looked
at
me
for
long
moments
his
eyes
dubious
i
do
not
like
to
think
about
the
next
half
hour
he
put
the
gag
back
in
my
mouth
he
had
his
strong
hands
and
he
had
the
small
sharp
knife
and
he
had
a
sadistic
knowledge
of
the
nerve
ends
from
time
to
time
he
would
stop
and
wait
until
i
quieted
down
then
loosen
the
gag
and
question
me
the
pain
and
humiliation
made
me
weep
like
a
child
once
i
fainted
finally
he
was
satisfied
he
had
learned
how
much
i
thought
of
ruth
he
had
learned
that
i
knew
that
we
had
to
go
where
the
money
was
hidden
by
boat
he
knew
that
i
had
guessed
we
would
start
from
the
rasi
house
north
of
town
and
he
knew
that
i
knew
no
more
than
that
after
that
he
cut
my
hands
loose
he
was
perfectly
safe
in
so
doing
i
was
too
enfeebled
by
pain
to
be
any
threat
to
him
you
get
the
money
you
dig
it
up
you
come
back
here
with
it
no
he
took
a
quick
half
step
toward
me
i
could
help
flinching
memory
of
what
he
could
do
was
too
clear
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
i
do
trust
you
to
do
what
you
promise
fitz
i
got
to
know
ruth
will
be
all
right
i
got
to
know
she
be
safe
or
you
do
get
the
money
i
broke
you
this
far
you
want
to
be
broken
the
rest
of
the
way
i
do
think
you
can
do
it
after
a
long
time
he
gave
a
shrug
of
disgust
maybe
not
how
do
you
want
it
worked
i
want
to
see
her
i
want
to
see
that
she
alive
before
i
give
you
the
money
it
could
be
by
the
river
then
if
you
try
to
cross
me
throw
the
money
in
the
river
i
swear
i
do
that
you
would
would
you
you
making
it
rough
i
ca
risk
being
seen
i
see
that
we
start
off
by
boat
at
one
i
do
know
how
far
we
have
to
go
or
how
long
it
will
take
you
could
bring
her
to
the
rasi
house
at
two
it
a
risk
it
isolated
there
no
phone
there
at
least
i
do
think
they
have
a
phone
i
give
you
the
money
and
i
see
that
you
get
a
fair
start
that
the
most
i
can
do
i
wo
try
to
make
it
any
safer
for
you
but
you
promise
a
fair
start
i
promise
that
he
snapped
out
the
bathroom
light
i
heard
the
door
open
and
then
heard
the
outer
door
open
and
close
i
walked
unsteadily
through
the
dark
room
to
the
front
door
i
opened
it
the
moon
was
gone
a
wind
sighed
across
the
flats
on
the
far
side
of
the
road
there
was
no
sign
that
fitzmartin
had
ever
been
there
the
night
was
still
he
was
very
good
in
the
night
i
remembered
that
there
was
a
kit
in
the
trunk
compartment
of
my
car
i
got
it
the
small
cuts
had
not
bled
very
much
i
cleaned
myself
up
and
bandaged
the
cuts
i
ached
all
over
i
felt
sick
and
weak
as
though
i
were
recovering
from
a
long
illness
i
kept
seeing
his
eyes
his
powerful
hands
had
punished
nerves
and
muscles
even
my
bones
felt
bruised
and
tender
i
went
to
bed
i
was
certain
that
ruth
was
still
alive
i
hoped
his
greed
would
be
stronger
than
his
wish
to
kill
i
hoped
his
greed
would
last
through
the
night
but
there
was
something
erratic
about
his
thought
patterns
there
was
an
incoherency
about
the
way
he
had
talked
jumping
from
one
subject
to
the
next
he
had
a
vast
confidence
in
his
own
powers
i
wondered
where
he
had
ruth
a
half
mile
away
across
country
maybe
she
was
in
his
car
and
it
was
parked
well
off
a
secondary
road
maybe
he
had
found
a
deserted
shed
as
i
lay
awake
trying
to
find
some
position
in
which
i
could
be
comfortable
i
heard
it
begin
to
rain
the
rain
was
light
at
first
a
mere
whisper
of
rain
and
then
it
began
to
come
down
it
thundered
on
the
roof
it
made
a
drench
of
the
world
bouncing
off
the
painted
metal
of
the
cars
coming
down
as
though
all
the
gates
of
the
skies
had
been
opened
twelve
i
awoke
at
dawn
it
was
still
raining
it
seemed
to
be
raining
harder
than
before
i
was
surprised
that
i
had
been
able
to
go
to
sleep
i
took
a
hot
shower
to
work
the
stiffness
out
of
my
muscles
the
small
cuts
stung
my
face
in
the
mirror
looked
like
the
face
of
a
stranger
with
sunken
eyes
and
flat
taut
cheeks
i
prayed
that
ruth
was
still
alive
i
prayed
that
she
had
lived
through
the
night
i
knew
what
would
have
happened
the
previous
night
had
i
not
found
cindy
i
would
be
lying
dead
on
the
tile
floor
they
would
find
me
there
i
shaved
and
dressed
and
left
the
motel
i
got
uncomfortably
wet
in
the
ten
feet
from
the
motel
door
to
the
car
door
i
drove
slowly
into
town
the
lights
on
peering
ahead
through
the
heavy
rain
curtain
i
drove
through
town
and
found
a
gas
station
open
on
the
far
side
i
had
the
car
gassed
up
farther
along
i
found
an
bean
wagon
a
disc
jockey
in
redding
was
giving
the
news
the
plastic
radio
was
behind
the
counter
as
yet
on
the
disappearance
of
ruth
stamm
only
daughter
of
doctor
buxton

is
believed
that

a
newcomer
to
hillston
george
warden
committed
suicide
this
week
but
certain
peculiarities
about
the
circumstances
of
warden
suicide
have
led
hillston
police
to
believe
that
it
may
have
been
murder
yesterday
the
hillston
police
assisted
by
gordon
county
police
officers
searched
a
summer

discovery
of
the
bodies
and
of
the
fulton
car
which
had
been
driven
into
the
lake
into
deep
water
has
led

to
believe
that
george
warden
killed
both
of
them
after
finding
them
together
at
the
summer
cottage
an
intensive
search

being
made
for

and
miss
stamm
full
details
of

it
is
believed
that
there
is
some
connection
between
fitzmartin
and
the
bodies

yesterday
at
the
summer

is
expected
that
federal
authorities

be
called

description

once

again
at
eight
to
wred
for
complete
local
news
the
disc
jockey
stopped
and
whistled
softly
how
about
that
folks
they
give
me
this
stuff
to
read
and
sometimes
i
read
it
and
do
even
listen
but
that
a
hot
one
that
one
can
grab
you
bodies
under
concrete
cars
in
lakes
suicides
that
are
suicides
a
gal
and
an
man
that
a
crazy
deal
they
got
down
there
in
hillston
that
got
all
the
makings
of
a
national
type
crime
well
back
to
the
mines
got
to
spin
some
of
this
stuff
but
before
i
do
let
me
tell
you
a
little
something
you
ought
to
know
you
good
folks
out
there
about
the
atlas
laundry
and
dry
cleaning
people
right
here
in
redding
over
on
downey
street
if
you
got
clothes
you
really
proud
of
and
i
guess
we
all
got
one
set
of
those
good
threads
at
least
then
you
the
fat
young
girl
behind
the
counter
turned
off
the
radio
that
character
she
said
amiably
to
me
ten
minutes
of
commercials
between
every
number
drive
you
nuts
i
just
turn
him
on
for
the
news
if
you
want
i
can
turn
him
back
on
or
find
something
else
no
thanks
how
about
that
stamm
girl
i
met
her
once
we
had
this
dog
see
got
him
when
he
was
a
puppy
but
this
highway
it
bad
to
try
to
have
a
dog
when
you
live
on
the
highway
he
got
himself
hit
and
we
took
him
to
stamm
the
girl
was
real
nice
pretty
sort
of
girl
but
blackie
was
too
far
gone
busted
his
back
so
they
had
to
give
him
a
shot
honest
i
cried
and
you
know
what
i
think
i
think
it
a
big
deal
for
those
two
i
think
she
maybe
ran
off
with
that
marine
you
can
figure
she
was
getting
any
younger
she
hear
about
all
the
mess
causing
and
she
get
in
touch
that
just
what
will
happen
could
be
i
said
of
course
it
could
be
you
want
more
coffee
maybe
sometimes
i
think
i
run
off
with
anybody
asked
me
just
to
get
out
of
this
rat
race
that
on
my
bad
days
is
this
day
a
stinker
though
it
keeps
coming
down
like
this
every
creek
in
the
county
will
be
flooded
it
gives
me
the
creeps
to
think
about
those
two
buried
under
a
garage
floor
all
that
time
i
never
knew
her
but
my
sister
knew
her
she
was
in
the
high
school
with
her
before
my
time
my
sister
says
she
did
a
lot
of
running
around
the
way
i
see
it
mister
if
a
husband
catches
his
wife
and
another
man
he
got
a
right
to
kill
the
two
of
them
it
like
what
they
say
the
unwritten
law
when
i
get
married
not
going
to
do
any
cheating
i
guess
it
is
so
bad
if
a
man
does
a
little
cheating
they
all
alike
beg
your
pardon
but
no
woman
with
a
home
and
husband
and
everything
has
any
right
to
jump
the
fence
do
you
think
so
he
made
his
big
mistake
burying
the
two
of
them
like
he
did
he
should
have
just
got
on
the
phone
and
said
to
the
police
boys
come
out
here
and
see
what
i
did
and
why
then
it
would
have
been
just
what
they
say
formalities
the
way
i
look
at
it
i
was
saved
by
two
truck
drivers
who
came
in
from
the
big
red
combo
that
had
just
parked
in
front
of
the
place
after
she
served
them
she
came
back
but
i
had
finished
as
she
gave
me
my
change
she
said
you
remember
what
i
told
you
now
that
girl
and
that
marine
ran
off
some
place
drive
carefully
i
drove
on
through
the
rain
the
cars
i
met
were
proceeding
with
great
care
it
should
have
been
full
daylight
but
it
had
gotten
appreciably
lighter
since
first
dawn
it
was
almost
nine
before
i
got
to
redding
i
parked
near
a
drugstore
and
phoned
her
number
from
a
booth
in
the
back
of
the
store
she
answered
the
phone
at
once
hello
this
is
tal
i
sorry
i
afraid
you
have
the
wrong
number
i
be
there
at
ten
like
you
said
that
perfectly
all
right
she
hung
up
her
last
comment
had
been
the
somebody
was
there
with
her
she
had
answered
as
though
i
had
apologized
i
wondered
if
it
would
be
all
set
for
ten
i
wondered
if
i
dared
try
again
i
went
to
the
drugstore
counter
and
had
coffee
the
counter
was
emptying
rapidly
as
people
went
to
work
i
bought
a
redding
paper
the
discovery
of
the
bodies
had
been
given
a
big
play
the
article
filled
in
a
little
more
background
than
the
radio
item
but
essentially
it
was
the
same
at
i
tried
again
she
answered
on
the
second
ring
hello
this
is
tal
again
yes
is
this
deal
off
or
on
what
goes
on
should
i
be
there
at
ten
this
coming
saturday
no
i
very
sorry
i
have
a
date
i
at
a
pay
phone
the
number
is
i
wait
right
here
until
you
can
call
me
back
no
i
so
sorry
maybe
some
other
time
give
me
a
ring
phone
as
soon
as
you
can
thank
you
i
took
a
booth
near
the
phone
booths
i
went
and
got
my
paper
and
ordered
more
coffee
i
waited
two
people
used
the
booth
at
five
minutes
to
ten
the
call
came
hello
is
that
you
tal
i
could
talk
before
i
glad
you
phoned
make
it
what
does
your
watch
say
exactly
four
minutes
of
do
park
out
back
park
a
block
away
start
up
at
exactly
and
go
slow
when
you
see
me
coming
unlatch
the
door
do
waste
time
getting
away
from
there
i
began
to
be
more
nervous
i
had
no
way
of
knowing
what
she
was
mixed
up
in
i
knew
her
playmates
would
be
hard
people
i
did
know
how
closely
they
would
be
watching
her
the
rain
had
begun
to
let
up
a
little
i
parked
a
block
away
from
her
apartment
house
i
could
see
it
i
kept
the
motor
running
i
kept
an
eye
on
my
watch
at
exactly
ten
fifteen
i
started
up
i
drove
slowly
i
saw
a
man
in
a
trench
coat
across
the
street
from
the
apartment
house
leaning
against
a
phone
pole
as
i
drew
even
with
the
apartment
house
slowing
down
she
came
running
i
swung
the
door
open
i
did
stop
she
piled
into
the
car
she
wore
a
dark
coat
a
black
hat
with
a
veil
and
carried
a
brown
case
like
a
dispatch
case
hurry
she
ordered
her
voice
was
shrill
frightened
i
speeded
up
she
was
looking
back
i
heard
a
hoarse
shout
keep
going
she
ordered
he
running
for
his
car
it
headed
the
wrong
way
they
posted
a
man
out
in
back
i
did
know
it
until
yesterday
afternoon
a
light
ahead
turned
red
there
was
cross
traffic
i
ran
the
light
tires
yelped
and
horns
blatted
with
indignation
i
barely
made
the
next
light
she
kept
watching
back
over
her
shoulder
it
took
fifteen
minutes
to
get
to
the
southbound
highway
the
road
to
hillston
once
we
were
out
on
the
highway
and
i
was
able
to
open
it
up
a
little
she
turned
around
i
glanced
at
her
her
left
eye
was
badly
puffed
and
discolored
her
left
cheek
was
bruised
i
remembered
the
story
of
the
small
girl
who
had
stayed
home
from
school
because
her
brother
had
blacked
her
eye
what
happened
to
your
face
i
got
bounced
around
a
little
people
got
annoyed
at
me
what
the
hell
have
you
been
mixed
up
in
do
worry
about
it
i
like
to
know
how
much
chance
i
was
taking
you
were
taking
it
i
was
taking
it
they
did
want
me
to
leave
anybody
leaves
they
get
the
idea
there
a
subpoena
in
the
background
and
a
committee
and
an
investigation
they
were
careless
i
learned
too
much
so
they
had
a
problem
do
they
kill
me
or
watch
me
they
watched
me
i
stupid
i
guess
i
was
having
a
big
time
i
thought
i
could
pull
out
any
time
i
did
know
they
played
so
rough
if
i
guessed
it
could
be
that
rough
i
would
have
gotten
that
far
in
you
ca
go
back
then
i
ca
ever
go
back
do
make
jokes
just
drive
as
fast
as
you
can
she
had
changed
in
the
short
time
since
i
seen
her
there
had
been
a
lot
of
arrogance
about
her
confidence
and
arrogance
and
a
flavor
of
enjoyment
that
was
gone
she
was
bitter
and
and
sullen
i
drove
the
rain
finally
stopped
the
sky
had
a
yellow
look
tires
made
a
wet
sound
on
the
road
the
ditches
were
full
we
went
through
a
village
children
romped
in
the
schoolyard
under
the
yellow
sky
i
did
not
like
what
i
was
going
to
have
to
do
to
her
she
had
given
me
a
certain
measure
of
trust
she
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
the
stakes
had
changed
she
could
not
know
i
was
willing
to
betray
her
that
i
had
to
betray
her
i
knew
i
could
not
risk
taking
her
to
the
motel
she
would
want
her
luggage
first
of
all
she
would
want
to
check
on
the
money
it
was
gone
she
would
want
an
explanation
and
there
was
no
explanation
i
could
give
her
i
would
betray
her
but
it
was
the
money
balanced
against
ruth
life
it
seemed
fantastic
that
i
could
have
seriously
considered
going
away
with
this
woman
who
sat
so
silently
beside
me
fists
clenched
nervously
against
the
dark
fabric
of
her
skirt
it
seemed
fantastic
that
i
could
have
gotten
wound
up
in
the
whole
thing
charlotte
was
several
lifetimes
in
the
past
when
i
had
come
home
i
had
felt
half
alive
now
i
was
entirely
alive
i
knew
what
i
wanted
and
why
and
knew
that
i
would
go
to
any
lengths
to
get
what
i
wanted
are
you
serious
in
thinking
they
would
kill
you
i
asked
she
laughed
a
single
short
flat
sound
i
know
where
the
body
is
buried
ever
hear
that
expression
it
was
a
party
i
did
want
to
go
on
in
the
first
place
i
knew
it
would
be
a
brawl
it
was
a
man
got
himself
killed
he
got
too
excited
not
a
bad
guy
young
guy
rich
family
got
a
big
whomp
out
of
running
around
with
the
rougher
element
you
know
liked
to
know
people
by
their
first
name
the
ones
who
had
been
in
jail
liked
to
be
able
to
get
his
parking
tickets
fixed
he
got
suddenly
taken
dead
sort
of
an
accident
a
very
important
fellow
shot
him
in
the
head
i
was
the
only
outsider
i
know
where
they
put
him
the
family
has
spent
a
fortune
in
the
last
five
years
looking
for
their
kid
they
still
looking
it
could
be
very
bad
it
was
very
bad
at
the
time
i
never
seen
anything
like
that
before
they
would
kill
you
if
they
think
i
talk
if
they
were
sure
of
it
and
had
a
chance
there
would
be
much
heat
over
me
not
over
this
pair
of
round
heels
the
kid
they
killed
is
real
heat
the
man
with
the
gun
was
drunk
i
was
with
the
man
with
the
gun
the
kid
thought
he
was
too
drunk
to
know
or
care
he
had
his
arms
around
me
when
he
was
shot
in
the
head
when
the
bullet
hit
his
head
he
grabbed
onto
me
so
hard
i
could
breathe
for
a
week
without
it
hurting
then
he
let
go
and
fell
down
and
tried
to
get
up
and
went
down
for
good
it
was
at
a
farm
they
put
him
in
an
old
cistern
and
filled
it
with
big
rocks
they
had
his
car
repainted
and
sold
through
channels
if
nothing
happens
in
six
months
or
so
they
stop
worrying
about
me
and
maybe
they
stop
looking
but
i
know
what
i
going
to
do
blond
dye
job
maybe
glasses
i
feel
better
if
i
do
look
like
myself
i
was
wondering
how
i
could
keep
her
away
from
the
motel
and
still
stall
long
enough
to
get
to
the
rasi
place
at
one
she
helped
out
by
saying
suddenly
what
been
going
on
down
in
hillston
anyhow
eloise
and
her
boy
friend
under
the
cement
that
stamm
girl
missing
george
knocking
himself
off
sounds
like
it
has
been
pretty
wild
down
there
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
that
i
sensed
a
new
wariness
about
her
just
what
do
you
mean
i
new
in
town
there
been
a
lot
going
on
i
have
had
anything
to
do
with
it
i
mean
i
been
in
on
it
as
a
bystander
but
all
but
the
police
like
to
keep
busy
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
we
did
go
on
back
through
town
to
the
motel
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
we
went
after
the
money
first
you
could
be
picked
up
i
might
be
but
what
for
i
do
like
this
if
they
pick
you
up
they
pick
me
up
and
word
would
get
back
to
redding
too
damn
fast
i
sorry
but
that
the
way
it
is
i
do
like
it
i
ca
help
that
i
think
we
ought
to
go
after
the
money
when
we
get
it
we
can
circle
around
town
and
get
to
the
motel
from
the
south
then
we
can
pick
up
our
luggage
and
be
on
our
way
then
that
means
spending
too
much
time
in
the
area
with
the
money
on
us
why
do
we
circle
around
and
get
the
baggage
first
then
when
we
get
the
money
we
on
our
way
they
know
where
i
staying
suppose
they
waiting
there
to
pick
us
up
damn
it
how
did
you
manage
to
mess
this
up
tal
howard
i
did
mess
it
up
it
is
a
big
city
i
a
stranger
after
a
man
named
fitzmartin
i
remember
that
name
you
said
he
knows
about
the
money
too
he
does
know
where
it
is
you
the
only
one
who
knows
where
it
is
why
are
they
after
him
on
account
of
the
girl
they
think
he
took
her
and
they
think
he
was
blackmailing
george
because
he
found
out
about
eloise
and
her
boy
friend
being
dead
and
they
think
he
killed
george
and
maybe
a
private
detective
named
grassman
busy
little
man
is
he
that
puts
me
in
the
picture
because
the
three
of
us
fitz
timmy
and
i
were
in
the
same
prison
camp
i
knew
this
was
going
to
be
a
mess
i
knew
it
do
be
such
a
pessimist
why
the
hell
did
you
bring
all
the
stuff
along
right
in
the
car
why
did
you
check
out
if
i
checked
out
they
be
looking
already
i
suppose
so
but
you
could
have
brought
my
stuff
anyway
i
did
think
of
that
you
do
seem
to
think
of
much
of
anything
do
you
do
get
nasty
it
is
going
to
help
everything
gets
messed
up
i
was
all
right
now
i
out
on
a
limb
i
should
be
laughing
i
think
we
ought
to
get
the
money
first
i
ca
go
like
this
i
do
want
to
ruin
these
clothes
ruin
your
clothes
where
are
we
going
never
mind
that
you
have
got
anything
but
good
clothes
in
i
stopped
too
suddenly
so
you
had
to
poke
around
she
said
vibrating
with
anger
did
you
have
a
good
time
did
you
like
what
you
saw
it
nice
stuff
i
know
it
nice
sometimes
it
was
so
nice
earning
it
but
i
know
it
nice
i
have
good
taste
did
you
count
the
money
attractive
color
do
you
think
green
i
counted
it
it
better
all
be
there
and
the
jewelry
better
all
be
there
every
damn
stone
the
jewelry
more
than
the
money
a
lot
of
people
thought
it
was
junk
jewelry
it
is
it
worth
three
or
four
times
the
money
it
all
there
it
safe
it
better
be
i
ca
go
in
these
clothes
we
have
to
go
somewhere
where
i
can
pick
up
some
jeans
i
thought
i
could
buy
them
in
hillston
now
you
ca
go
into
hillston
so
where
do
we
go
you
know
the
area
better
than
i
do
let
me
think
a
minute
she
told
me
where
to
turn
we
made
a
left
heading
east
twenty
miles
north
of
hillston
it
was
a
narrow
busy
road
ten
miles
from
the
turn
was
the
town
of
westonville
a
small
grubby
town
with
a
narrow
main
street
i
circled
a
block
until
i
found
an
empty
meter
i
watched
her
walk
away
from
the
car
men
turned
to
look
at
her
men
would
always
turn
to
look
at
that
walk
i
went
into
a
drugstore
and
came
back
with
cigarettes
she
was
back
in
about
ten
minutes
with
a
brown
parcel
all
right
she
said
let
go
i
got
what
i
need
we
headed
back
toward
the
redding
road
she
said
find
a
place
where
you
can
get
off
the
road
i
want
to
change
into
this
stuff
how
about
ahead
there
on
the
left
that
little
road
i
turned
up
the
little
road
she
pointed
out
we
passed
two
dreary
farmhouses
the
road
entered
a
patch
of
woods
i
turned
onto
an
old
lumber
road
the
clay
was
greasy
under
the
wheels
after
we
went
around
a
bend
i
stopped
she
opened
the
door
on
her
side
and
got
out
she
bent
over
the
seat
and
undid
the
parcel
she
took
out
a
pair
of
slacks
some
cheap
sneakers
and
a
wooly
yellow
sweat
shirt
she
took
the
black
suit
jacket
off
and
folded
it
and
put
it
on
the
back
seat
the
odd
light
of
the
yellow
sky
came
down
through
the
trees
the
leaves
dripped
she
undid
her
skirt
at
the
side
and
stepped
out
of
it
carefully
there
was
no
coyness
about
her
not
the
slightest
flavor
of
modesty
she
did
not
care
whether
i
stared
at
her
or
averted
my
eyes
she
folded
the
skirt
and
put
it
with
the
jacket
she
took
her
blouse
off
and
put
it
carefully
on
the
back
seat
she
stood
there
in
the
woodland
in
black
hat
with
veil
black
shoes
skimpy
bra
and
panties
looking
both
provocative
and
ridiculous
the
hat
was
last
she
gave
me
a
wry
look
and
said
strip
tease
alfresco
are
you
supposed
to
stamp
your
feet
or
something
are
you
cold
i
a
thing
she
put
the
wooly
baggy
sweat
shirt
on
then
stepped
into
the
slacks
and
pulled
them
up
around
her
full
hips
and
fastened
them
with
zipper
and
buttons
she
sat
on
the
car
seat
and
took
off
her
black
shoes
and
put
them
in
back
and
put
on
the
sneakers
and
laced
them
up
good
god
i
have
had
clothes
like
this
in
years
how
do
i
look
tal
i
could
tell
her
how
she
looked
it
was
a
return
to
the
girl
who
had
gone
on
the
bike
trips
with
timmy
i
would
have
guessed
it
would
have
made
her
look
younger
and
fresher
but
it
did
her
body
was
too
ripe
her
eyes
and
mouth
too
knowing
the
years
had
taken
her
beyond
the
point
where
she
could
wear
such
clothes
and
look
young
she
read
the
look
in
my
eyes
not
so
good
i
guess
not
good
at
all
you
do
have
to
say
it
you
look
fine
do
be
a
damned
fool
wait
a
minute
while
i
use
the
facilities
and
then
we
get
out
of
here
she
went
off
into
the
woods
out
of
sight
of
the
car
she
was
back
in
a
few
minutes
i
backed
out
i
looked
at
my
watch
the
time
problem
had
been
nearly
solved
it
was
a
little
past
i
pulled
into
the
yard
of
the
doyle
place
the
rasi
place
where
she
had
been
born
i
saw
that
the
boy
had
finished
painting
the
boat
it
looks
even
worse
than
i
remember
she
said
she
got
out
of
the
car
and
went
toward
the
porch
the
chickens
were
under
the
porch
the
dog
lay
on
the
porch
he
thumped
his
tail
antoinette
leaned
over
and
scratched
him
behind
the
ear
he
thudded
the
tail
with
more
energy
her
sister
came
to
the
doorway
dirty
towel
in
her
hand
hello
anita
antoinette
said
calmly
what
are
you
doing
here
doyle
do
want
you
coming
around
here
you
know
that
doyle
antoinette
said
do
use
that
kind
of
language
with
kids
in
the
house
i
warning
you
the
girl
who
had
cried
came
up
behind
her
mother
and
stared
at
us
you
so
damn
cautious
about
the
kids
antoinette
said
with
contempt
hi
there
sandy
hi
the
girl
said
in
a
muted
voice
you
give
the
kids
such
a
nice
home
and
all
anita
i
do
what
i
can
do
i
do
the
best
i
can
look
at
the
way
she
dressed
i
sent
money
why
do
you
spend
some
of
it
on
clothes
or
does
doyle
drink
it
there
no
reason
for
her
to
wear
her
good
stuff
around
the
house
what
do
you
want
here
anyway
what
did
you
come
around
here
for
she
gestured
toward
me
with
her
head
he
was
here
asking
about
you
i
told
him
where
to
look
i
guess
he
found
you
there
all
right
in
the
big
sinful
city
good
god
anita
come
off
it
it
eats
on
you
that
you
never
figured
it
out
right
you
never
worked
it
so
you
got
up
there
now
you
got
doyle
and
look
at
you
you
fat
and
you
ugly
and
you
dirty
the
child
began
to
cry
again
anita
turned
and
slapped
her
across
the
face
and
sent
her
back
into
the
house
she
turned
back
to
antoinette
her
face
pale
you
ca
come
in
my
house
i
would
put
my
foot
in
that
shack
anita
are
the
oars
in
the
shed
what
do
you
want
with
oars
i
taking
that
boat
there
something
i
want
to
show
my
friend
what
do
you
mean
you
ca
use
any
of
the
boats
maybe
you
want
to
try
and
stop
me
i
using
a
boat
i
taking
a
boat
you
go
out
on
the
river
today
you
drownd
yourself
look
at
it
take
a
good
look
at
it
we
turned
and
looked
at
the
river
the
gray
water
raced
by
it
had
a
soapy
look
the
boil
of
the
current
looked
vicious
i
been
out
in
worse
than
that
and
you
know
it
is
the
shed
locked
no
anita
said
sullenly
come
on
tal
antoinette
said
i
followed
her
to
the
shed
she
selected
a
pair
of
oars
measured
them
to
make
certain
she
had
mates
we
went
to
the
overturned
boat
we
righted
it
it
was
heavy
she
tried
the
oars
in
the
locks
to
be
certain
they
would
fit
she
got
on
one
side
and
i
got
on
the
other
and
we
slid
the
boat
stern
first
down
the
muddy
bank
to
the
water
we
put
it
half
in
the
water
the
current
caught
at
it
boiling
around
the
stern
antoinette
straightened
up
and
looked
at
the
river
anita
was
watching
us
from
the
porch
the
pale
face
of
the
little
girl
watched
us
from
a
cracked
window
it
pretty
damn
rough
antoinette
said
we
wo
have
much
trouble
getting
down
to
the
island
island
right
down
there
see
it
that
where
we
going
the
island
was
about
three
hundred
yards
downstream
it
was
perhaps
three
hundred
feet
long
and
half
as
wide
it
was
rocky
and
wooded
it
split
the
river
into
two
narrow
areas
of
roaring
turbulence
i
do
think
we
can
make
it
back
to
here
we
can
walk
the
boat
down
the
shore
and
land
further
down
when
we
leave
then
walk
back
up
to
the
car
and
tell
them
where
the
boat
is
they
can
get
it
when
the
river
quiets
down
the
worst
part
is
going
to
be
right
at
the
start
get
it
parallel
to
the
shore
tal
we
struggled
with
the
boat
she
slipped
on
the
muddy
bank
and
sat
down
hard
and
cursed
i
held
the
stern
the
bow
was
pointed
downstream
shall
i
row
i
asked
over
the
sound
of
the
water
i
used
to
it
wait
until
i
get
set
when
i
say
go
you
get
into
the
stern
she
got
in
and
put
the
oars
in
the
locks
held
them
poised
she
nodded
to
me
i
got
in
the
current
caught
us
it
threatened
to
spin
the
boat
but
she
got
it
quickly
under
control
it
was
necessary
to
row
she
watched
over
her
shoulder
and
guided
us
by
fast
alternate
dips
of
the
oars
she
was
quick
and
competent
as
we
neared
the
island
the
fast
current
split
she
dipped
both
oars
and
gave
a
single
hard
pull
that
sent
us
directly
at
the
island
the
boat
ran
ashore
the
bow
wedging
in
the
branches
and
rubble
that
had
caught
there
on
the
shelving
shore
brought
downriver
by
the
hard
rains
she
was
out
quickly
and
pulled
the
boat
up
farther
i
jumped
out
onto
the
shore
and
stood
beside
her
her
eyes
were
wide
and
sad
and
thoughtful
we
used
to
come
here
a
lot
come
on
i
followed
her
we
pushed
through
thickets
and
came
to
a
steep
path
they
had
come
to
the
island
often
and
so
had
a
lot
of
other
people
leaving
behind
them
empty
rusting
beer
cans
broken
bottles
sodden
paper
plates
waxed
paper
tinfoil
empty
cigarette
packs
the
path
climbed
between
rocks
she
walked
quickly
she
stopped
at
a
high
point
i
came
up
beside
her
it
was
the
highest
point
of
the
rocky
island
perhaps
sixty
feet
above
the
level
of
the
river
we
stood
behind
a
natural
wall
of
rock
it
came
to
waist
level
i
could
see
the
shack
see
anita
in
the
distance
walking
heavily
across
the
littered
yard
see
the
gleam
of
my
car
through
the
leaves
look
antoinette
said
sharply
i
looked
where
she
pointed
a
boat
was
coming
down
the
river
it
was
caught
in
the
current
and
it
spun
the
man
kneeling
in
the
stern
using
a
single
oar
as
a
rudder
brought
it
under
control
a
dingy
red
boat
under
a
yellow
sky
on
a
soapy
gray
river
and
the
man
in
the
boat
had
pale
hair
he
came
closer
and
i
saw
his
face
he
looked
up
and
saw
us
to
him
we
were
outlined
against
the
yellow
sky
then
the
dwarf
trees
screened
him
he
landed
on
the
island
antoinette
said
i
knew
he
had
landed
i
knew
he
had
watched
us
i
guessed
that
he
had
gotten
hold
of
a
boat
and
waited
on
the
opposite
shore
fitzmartin
would
not
take
the
chance
of
trusting
me
maybe
he
could
maybe
ruth
was
dead
that
fitzmartin
i
said
she
stared
at
me
her
eyes
were
hard
you
arranged
this
no
honestly
i
did
arrange
it
what
does
he
know
why
did
he
follow
us
i
think
he
guessed
we
after
the
money
she
leaned
calmly
against
the
rock
and
folded
her
arms
all
right
tal
this
is
the
end
of
it
you
and
your
friend
can
hunt
for
it
have
fun
i
be
damned
if
i
tell
you
where
it
is
i
took
her
by
the
shoulders
and
shook
her
do
be
a
damn
fool
that
man
is
insane
i
mean
that
he
killed
two
people
maybe
three
you
ca
just
wait
for
him
and
say
you
wo
tell
him
do
you
think
just
ask
you
politely
after
he
gets
his
hands
on
you
you
tell
him
she
pushed
my
hands
away
i
saw
the
doubt
in
her
expression
i
tried
to
explain
what
fitzmartin
was
she
looked
down
the
path
the
way
we
had
come
she
bit
her
lip
come
on
then
she
said
can
we
circle
around
and
get
to
the
boat
this
is
better
she
said
i
followed
her
thirteen
i
thought
i
heard
him
call
the
sound
mingling
with
the
noise
of
the
river
i
followed
antoinette
she
led
the
way
down
a
curving
path
toward
the
south
end
of
the
island
the
path
dipped
into
a
flat
place
rock
walls
were
high
on
either
side
of
us
it
was
a
hollow
where
people
had
built
fires
she
paused
uncertainly
it
so
overgrown
she
said
what
are
you
looking
for
she
moved
to
one
side
and
looked
at
the
sloping
wall
she
nodded
to
herself
and
went
up
nimble
as
a
cat
using
the
tough
vines
to
pull
herself
up
she
stopped
and
spread
the
vines
she
was
above
a
ledge
she
turned
and
motioned
to
me
my
leather
soles
gave
me
trouble
i
slipped
and
scrambled
but
i
made
it
to
the
ledge
beside
her
she
pushed
tough
weeds
and
vines
aside
she
sat
down
and
put
her
feet
in
the
dark
hole
and
wormed
her
way
forward
when
she
was
in
up
to
her
hips
she
lay
back
and
using
her
hands
on
the
upper
edge
of
the
small
slit
in
the
rocks
pulled
herself
in
the
rest
of
the
way
i
made
hard
work
of
it
it
was
narrow
she
pulled
at
my
ankles
finally
i
was
inside
she
leaned
across
me
her
weight
on
me
and
pulled
the
weeds
and
vines
back
to
cover
the
hole
at
first
i
could
not
see
and
then
my
eyes
became
used
to
the
light
daylight
came
weakly
through
the
hole
the
hole
itself
the
slit
in
the
rocks
was
not
over
thirty
inches
long
and
fourteen
inches
high
at
its
widest
point
inside
it
widened
out
to
about
five
feet
and
the
ceiling
was
about
three
feet
high
it
was
perhaps
seven
feet
deep
she
said
in
a
low
voice
timmy
found
it
he
was
climbing
on
the
rocks
one
day
and
he
found
it
it
always
dry
and
clean
in
here
see
the
sand
is
dry
and
feel
how
fine
it
is
it
became
our
place
it
became
my
favorite
place
in
the
whole
world
i
used
to
come
here
alone
too
when
things
got
too
rugged
we
used
to
keep
things
here
a
box
with
candles
and
cigarettes
and
things
nobody
in
the
world
could
ever
find
us
here
we
kept
blankets
here
and
pillows
we
called
it
our
house
kid
stuff
i
guess
but
it
was
nice
i
never
thought
i
come
back
here
then
this
is
the
place
he
meant
let
look
it
was
easy
to
dig
in
the
sand
she
found
the
first
one
she
gave
a
little
gasp
of
pleasure
when
she
found
it
she
dug
it
out
of
the
soft
sand
we
held
it
close
to
the
weak
daylight
and
opened
it
the
wire
clamp
slid
off
easily
the
rubber
ring
was
stuck
to
the
glass
i
pulled
the
top
off
the
bills
were
tightly
packed
i
pulled
some
of
them
out
two
tens
and
a
twenty
we
both
dug
in
the
place
where
she
had
found
it
we
found
three
more
jars
that
was
all
we
lined
them
up
against
the
wall
i
could
see
the
money
through
the
glass
i
looked
at
the
money
i
remembered
how
i
had
thought
it
would
be
i
had
thought
it
would
be
an
answer
but
i
had
found
the
answer
before
i
found
the
money
now
it
meant
only
that
perhaps
it
could
still
be
traded
for
a
life
now
he
coming
this
way
she
whispered
i
heard
him
when
he
called
again
howard
tal
howard
we
lay
prone
propped
up
on
our
elbows
our
heads
near
the
small
entrance
her
cheek
inches
from
mine
tal
howard
he
called
alarmingly
close
he
was
passing
just
below
us
his
head
about
six
or
seven
feet
below
the
ledge
he
called
again
at
a
greater
distance
and
then
all
we
could
hear
was
the
sound
of
the
river
what
will
we
do
she
whispered
all
we
can
do
is
outwait
him
we
ca
deal
with
him
he
wo
make
any
deals
he
way
beyond
that
we
have
to
wait
until
night
i
do
think
he
leave
we
have
to
try
to
get
to
the
water
at
night
can
you
swim
of
course
we
can
make
it
to
shore
then
with
the
money
there
was
no
point
in
telling
her
the
deal
i
had
planned
there
was
no
chance
of
making
the
deal
i
was
certain
that
if
he
found
us
he
kill
both
of
us
when
he
had
talked
to
me
i
had
sensed
the
pleasure
he
took
in
killing
the
way
he
had
talked
of
george
and
the
way
he
had
talked
about
holding
the
knife
at
ruth
throat
that
can
happen
to
a
man
there
are
men
who
hunt
who
do
not
take
their
greatest
pleasure
in
the
skill
of
the
hunt
but
rather
in
the
moment
of
seeing
the
deer
stumble
and
fall
or
the
ragged
bird
come
rocketing
down
from
animal
to
man
is
a
difference
in
degree
not
in
kind
the
lust
to
kill
is
in
some
men
it
has
sexual
overtones
i
had
sensed
that
in
fitzmartin
i
could
even
sense
it
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
as
he
had
called
to
me
when
he
had
passed
the
cave
a
warm
almost
jocular
tone
he
knew
we
were
on
the
island
he
knew
he
would
find
us
he
felt
warm
toward
us
because
we
would
give
him
pleasure
out
and
be
killed
tal
a
warm
and
confident
voice
it
was
not
so
much
as
though
he
had
stepped
beyond
sanity
but
as
though
he
had
stepped
outside
the
race
had
become
another
creature
it
was
the
same
way
we
all
might
one
day
be
hunted
down
by
the
alien
creatures
of
some
far
planet
when
the
day
comes
how
do
we
bargain
for
life
what
can
the
rabbit
say
to
the
barrel
of
a
gun
i
lay
on
my
side
she
lay
facing
me
i
saw
the
sheen
of
her
eyes
and
the
whiteness
of
her
teeth
in
the
half
light
of
the
cave
i
could
sense
the
soft
tempo
of
her
breathing
so
we
wait
she
said
and
we
have
to
be
very
careful
he
likes
the
night
we
be
careful
it
worth
being
careful
you
know
tal
i
thought
all
along
this
would
get
messed
up
now
i
do
think
so
any
more
is
that
strange
now
that
it
is
as
bad
as
it
can
get
i
think
going
to
make
it
i
hope
so
she
rolled
onto
her
back
her
voice
was
soft
we
going
to
make
it
we
get
to
the
car
there
enough
money
here
it
is
worth
the
risk
of
going
back
after
my
things
we
drive
through
the
night
tal
we
drive
all
night
we
take
turns
i
a
good
driver
i
know
just
how
it
going
to
be
we
go
to
new
orleans
we
can
be
there
late
tomorrow
i
know
a
man
there
he
help
us
we
sell
the
car
there
we
catch
our
plane
there
we
have
everything
new
all
new
clothes
mexico
city
first
i
think
then
over
to
havana
i
was
in
havana
once
with
a
friend
no
not
havana
where
will
we
go
from
there
tal
rio
buenos
aires
then
paris
paris
of
course
it
funny
i
always
been
looking
like
that
game
where
you
come
into
the
room
and
they
named
something
but
you
do
know
what
it
is
and
you
have
to
find
out
i
been
looking
for
something
i
do
know
the
name
of
ever
feel
like
that
yes
you
do
know
what
it
is
but
you
want
it
you
look
in
a
lot
of
places
for
it
you
try
a
lot
of
things
but
they
are
it
this
time
i
know
i
going
to
find
it
we
were
quiet
for
a
long
time
she
turned
toward
me
again
i
put
my
hand
on
the
curve
of
her
waist
let
it
rest
there
and
felt
the
quickening
tempo
of
her
breathing
i
do
not
try
to
excuse
it
until
then
she
had
had
no
special
appeal
to
me
i
can
try
to
explain
it
it
is
an
urgency
that
comes
at
times
of
danger
it
is
something
deep
in
the
blood
that
urgency
it
is
a
message
from
the
blood
you
may
die
live
this
once
more
this
last
time
or
it
may
be
more
complicated
there
may
be
defiance
in
it
your
answer
to
the
blackness
that
wants
to
swallow
you
to
leave
this
one
thing
behind
you
to
perform
this
act
which
may
leave
a
life
behind
you
the
only
possible
guarantee
of
immortality
in
any
form
when
catastrophe
strikes
cities
people
learn
of
this
basal
urge
men
and
women
in
war
know
it
it
is
present
in
great
intensity
in
many
kinds
of
sickness
men
and
women
are
triggered
by
danger
and
they
lie
together
in
a
hungry
quickness
in
the
cellars
of
bombed
houses
behind
the
brush
of
mountain
trails
in
lifeboats
on
forgotten
beaches
on
the
grounds
of
sanitariums
by
the
time
it
happened
i
knew
that
i
was
hopelessly
in
love
with
ruth
stamm
and
i
knew
this
woman
in
the
cave
with
me
was
hard
as
stone
but
she
was
there
i
took
from
her
the
stubborn
slacks
and
the
bulky
sweat
shirt
and
the
satin
white
bra
her
flesh
gleamed
dusky
in
the
cave
light
we
did
not
speak
it
was
very
complete
for
us
it
was
enough
that
she
was
woman
but
with
her
first
words
she
turned
back
into
antoinette
rasi
and
destroyed
any
possible
emotional
overtones
well
are
we
the
ones
she
said
her
voice
a
bit
nasal
she
bumped
her
head
on
the
roof
as
she
was
getting
her
shirt
back
on
and
commented
on
it
with
a
very
basic
vocabulary
i
turned
so
that
i
did
not
have
to
look
at
her
i
lay
and
looked
out
the
entrance
through
the
gaps
between
the
vines
and
leaves
i
could
see
the
rock
wall
on
the
other
side
of
the
hollow
thirty
feet
away
by
lowering
my
head
and
looking
up
i
could
see
a
wedge
of
yellow
sky
above
the
rock
as
i
watched
i
saw
fitzmartin
head
and
then
his
shoulders
above
the
rock
wall
behind
me
antoinette
started
to
say
something
in
a
complaining
voice
i
reached
back
quickly
and
caught
her
arm
and
grasped
it
warningly
she
stopped
talking
immediately
she
moved
forward
and
leaned
her
warm
weight
against
the
back
of
my
left
shoulder
so
that
she
too
could
see
it
was
instinctive
to
want
to
pull
back
into
the
cave
but
i
knew
he
could
not
see
my
face
or
hers
behind
the
dense
screen
he
stood
on
the
rock
against
the
sky
feet
spread
balancing
easily
he
held
a
gun
in
his
hand
his
big
hand
masked
the
gun
but
it
looked
like
a
luger
the
strange
sky
made
a
dull
glint
on
the
barrel
when
he
moved
his
head
he
moved
it
quickly
as
an
animal
does
his
mouth
was
slack
lips
parted
his
khaki
pants
were
soaked
to
the
knees
he
studied
the
rock
wall
where
the
cave
was
foot
by
foot
i
flinched
involuntarily
when
his
gaze
moved
across
the
cave
mouth
he
turned
and
moved
out
of
sight
she
put
her
lips
close
to
my
ear
my
god
i
can
see
what
you
mean
dear
jesus
i
glad
i
did
wait
to
have
a
chat
with
he
a
damn
monster
how
come
he
was
running
around
loose
he
looked
all
right
before
it
was
on
the
inside
now
it
showing
frankly
he
scares
the
hell
out
of
me
i
tell
you
they
ought
to
shoot
him
on
sight
like
a
crazy
dog
he
getting
worse
you
ca
get
any
worse
than
that
what
was
he
looking
over
here
for
i
think
he
eliminating
places
where
we
could
be
one
by
one
got
a
lot
of
daylight
i
hope
he
eliminated
this
place
you
ca
see
much
from
over
there
just
a
sort
of
shadow
and
the
hole
looks
too
little
even
if
it
did
have
the
stuff
in
front
of
it
i
hope
you
right
he
gives
me
the
creeps
i
kept
a
careful
watch
the
next
time
i
saw
him
he
was
climbing
down
the
wall
on
the
far
side
antoinette
saw
him
too
her
hand
tightened
on
my
shoulder
her
breath
was
warm
against
my
ear
what
he
doing
down
there
she
whispered
i
think
he
trying
to
track
us
i
do
know
how
good
he
is
at
it
if
he
good
he
find
that
our
tracks
end
somewhere
in
the
hollow
the
ground
was
soft
she
whispered
dear
god
i
hope
he
does
know
how
he
was
out
of
sight
we
heard
one
rock
clatter
against
another
audible
above
the
soft
roar
of
the
river
we
moved
as
far
back
in
the
little
cave
as
we
could
get
nothing
happened
for
a
long
time
we
gradually
relaxed
again
moved
up
to
where
we
could
watch
it
must
have
been
a
full
half
hour
later
when
i
saw
him
on
the
far
side
clambering
up
he
sat
on
the
rim
at
the
top
he
aimed
carefully
somewhere
off
to
our
right
and
pulled
the
trigger
the
sound
was
flat
torn
away
by
the
wind
he
aimed
and
fired
again
this
time
closer
i
realized
too
late
what
he
was
doing
i
tried
to
scramble
back
he
fired
again
antoinette
gave
a
great
raw
scream
of
agony
blood
burst
from
her
face
the
slug
had
furrowed
down
her
face
smashed
her
teeth
and
her
jaw
striking
at
an
angle
just
under
her
cheekbone
she
screamed
again
the
ruined
mouth
hanging
open
i
saw
the
next
shot
take
her
just
above
the
left
collarbone
angling
down
through
her
body
she
dug
her
fingers
down
into
the
sand
arched
her
body
then
settled
into
death
as
the
next
bullet
slapped
damply
into
her
flesh
i
was
pressed
hard
against
the
rocks
at
the
side
he
shot
twice
more
into
her
body
and
then
there
was
silence
i
tried
to
compress
myself
into
the
smallest
possible
target
when
he
fired
again
it
was
from
a
different
angle
the
slug
hammered
off
rock
ricocheting
inside
the
small
cave
hitting
two
walls
so
quickly
the
sound
was
almost
simultaneous
before
it
buried
itself
in
the
sand
the
next
one
ricocheted
and
from
the
sharp
pain
in
my
face
i
thought
it
had
hit
me
but
it
had
filled
my
right
cheek
with
sharp
rock
fragments
i
could
move
no
farther
to
the
side
if
he
found
the
proper
angle
he
would
hit
me
directly
if
he
did
not
a
ricochet
could
kill
me
i
grasped
her
body
and
pulled
it
over
me
he
fired
several
more
shots
one
broke
one
of
the
jars
another
hit
her
body
my
hands
were
sticky
with
her
blood
i
shielded
my
head
against
her
heavy
breast
my
legs
pulled
up
i
tried
to
adjust
the
body
so
it
would
give
me
maximum
cover
a
ricocheting
slug
rapped
the
heel
of
my
shoe
with
such
force
that
it
numbed
my
foot
i
gave
a
harsh
loud
cry
of
pain
the
shooting
stopped
after
a
few
minutes
he
spoke
in
an
almost
conversational
tone
he
was
close
under
the
cave
howard
howard
come
on
out
of
there
i
did
not
answer
he
had
thought
of
caves
had
fired
into
the
shadowy
places
had
hit
the
right
one
i
hoped
he
would
believe
us
both
dead
it
was
my
only
chance
that
he
should
believe
us
both
dead
i
wormed
my
way
out
from
under
her
body
there
was
no
loose
stone
in
the
cave
there
were
only
the
jars
of
money
i
took
one
jar
and
crouched
off
to
the
left
of
the
entrance
i
heard
the
rattle
of
the
rocks
and
knew
he
was
climbing
i
saw
the
vines
tremble
i
was
poised
and
ready
to
hurl
the
jar
at
his
face
but
his
face
did
not
appear
his
strong
hand
appeared
moving
slowly
into
the
cave
inviting
me
to
try
to
grasp
it
it
was
a
clever
move
i
knew
that
he
was
probably
braced
there
gun
in
the
other
hand
waiting
for
such
a
try
more
of
his
arm
came
into
the
cave
i
could
see
his
shoulder
blocking
off
the
light
but
i
could
not
see
his
head
his
brown
hand
crept
across
the
sand
it
touched
antoinette
dark
hair
paused
for
a
moment
felt
its
way
to
her
face
touched
lightly
her
dead
eyes
she
lay
curled
where
i
had
pushed
the
body
in
crawling
out
from
under
it
the
hand
moved
across
the
sand
again
it
came
to
her
flexed
knee
touched
the
knee
felt
the
material
of
the
jeans
in
that
moment
i
realized
that
he
thought
it
was
my
knee
he
had
only
seen
her
from
the
waist
up
when
he
had
approached
the
island
in
the
boat
she
was
curled
in
such
a
way
he
did
not
relate
the
knee
to
the
face
he
had
touched
his
powerful
fingers
bit
through
the
blue
jean
material
caught
the
flesh
underneath
and
twisted
it
cruelly
i
heard
his
soft
grunt
of
satisfaction
i
readied
myself
he
put
both
arms
in
and
wormed
his
way
in
head
first
i
knew
he
would
not
be
able
to
see
immediately
the
gun
was
in
his
hand
as
soon
as
his
head
appeared
in
the
opening
inside
the
vines
i
smashed
the
glass
jar
full
into
his
face
the
jar
smashed
cutting
my
hand
i
tried
to
snatch
at
the
gun
but
i
was
too
slow
he
was
gone
i
heard
the
thud
as
he
fell
i
knew
that
i
could
not
afford
to
give
him
time
to
recover
i
scraped
myself
badly
as
i
slid
through
the
entrance
i
grasped
the
vines
and
stood
up
teetering
on
the
ledge
i
saw
him
below
me
he
was
on
his
hands
and
knees
gun
still
in
his
hand
shaking
his
head
in
a
slow
heavy
way
it
was
a
twelve
foot
drop
perhaps
a
little
more
i
dropped
onto
him
i
landed
on
the
small
of
his
back
heels
together
legs
stiff
my
weight
smashed
him
to
the
ground
the
fall
jolted
me
i
rolled
to
my
feet
with
agonizing
slowness
and
turned
to
face
the
expected
shot
he
lay
quite
still
his
finger
tips
touched
the
gun
i
picked
it
up
and
moved
back
away
from
him
and
watched
him
by
watching
closely
i
could
see
the
movement
of
his
back
as
he
breathed
i
aimed
at
his
head
but
i
could
not
make
myself
fire
then
i
saw
that
the
breathing
had
stopped
i
wondered
if
it
was
a
trick
i
picked
up
a
stone
and
threw
it
at
him
it
hit
his
back
and
bounded
away
finally
i
approached
him
and
rolled
him
over
and
i
knew
that
he
was
dead
he
died
in
a
curious
way
he
had
fallen
back
off
the
narrow
ledge
fallen
with
the
broken
pieces
of
the
heavy
glass
jar
stunned
he
had
gotten
to
his
hands
and
knees
he
was
trying
to
clear
his
head
when
i
had
smashed
him
back
to
the
ground
a
large
piece
of
the
broken
jar
had
been
under
his
throat
as
i
had
watched
him
his
blood
had
soaked
into
the
sandy
soil
his
blood
had
soaked
a
thick
wad
of
the
money
that
had
been
in
the
jar
a
wind
blew
through
the
hollow
there
were
some
loose
bills
the
wind
swirled
them
around
one
blew
toward
me
i
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
it
stupidly
it
was
a
bill
i
went
up
to
the
cave
again
i
think
i
had
the
idea
of
carrying
her
down
i
knew
i
could
not
make
it
i
looked
at
her
paris
was
out
it
was
done
i
looked
at
her
and
wondered
if
this
after
all
had
been
what
she
was
looking
for
it
could
have
been
it
could
have
been
the
nameless
thing
she
sought
but
i
guessed
that
had
she
been
given
her
choice
she
would
have
wanted
it
in
a
different
form
not
so
ugly
not
with
ruined
face
and
cheap
clothes
i
climbed
back
down
i
was
exhausted
a
few
feet
from
the
bottom
i
slipped
and
fell
again
i
gathered
up
all
the
money
i
put
it
in
the
cave
with
her
they
could
come
and
find
it
there
when
i
told
them
where
it
was
i
went
back
to
where
we
had
left
the
boat
the
river
seemed
a
little
quieter
i
took
the
line
and
walked
the
boat
down
to
the
south
end
of
the
island
the
current
tugged
at
it
below
the
island
the
river
was
quieter
i
got
into
the
boat
just
as
i
started
to
row
toward
the
shore
it
began
to
rain
again
rain
that
fell
out
of
a
yellow
sky
the
rain
whispered
on
the
gray
river
it
diluted
the
blood
on
my
hands
the
rain
was
on
my
face
like
tears
the
banks
were
high
i
found
a
place
to
beach
the
boat
about
a
thousand
yards
below
the
rasi
place
i
walked
through
wet
grass
to
the
road
i
walked
to
the
rasi
place
anita
came
out
i
asked
if
she
had
a
phone
i
could
use
we
got
no
phone
where
the
boat
what
did
you
do
with
the
boat
where
antoinette
what
all
the
blood
on
your
clothes
happened
she
was
still
screaming
questions
at
me
when
i
fitted
the
key
into
the
ignition
started
the
car
and
drove
away
heavy
clouds
had
darkened
the
afternoon
i
had
never
seen
it
rain
as
hard
traffic
crept
through
the
charcoal
streets
of
hillston
their
lights
yellow
and
feeble
in
the
rain
i
turned
through
the
arch
and
parked
beside
the
police
cars
in
the
courtyard
of
the
station
a
man
yelled
at
me
from
a
doorway
telling
me
i
could
park
there
i
paid
no
attention
to
him
i
found
prine
captain
marion
was
in
he
gone
home
to
sleep
prine
stared
at
me
in
a
funny
way
he
took
my
arm
when
he
led
me
to
a
chair
are

drunk

not
drunk

of

near
the
river

she
alive

do
know
where
to
look

would
be
far
from
where

the
chief
of
police

sent
people
out
to
look
in
the
rain

of
people
searched
i
rode
with
prine
in
the
end
it
was
a
contingent
of
boy
scouts
who
found
her
they
found
the
black
coupé
the
trunk
compartment
was
open
a
half
inch
we
sped
through
the
rain
when
word
came
over
the
radio
but
the
ambulance
got
there
first
they
were
loading
her
onto
the
ambulance
when
we
arrived
they
closed
the
doors
and
drove
away
before
i
could
get
to
the
ambulance
the
car
was
parked
behind
a
roadside
sign
it
had
been
covered
with
roofing
paper
some
of
the
paper
had
shifted
in
the
wind
one
of
the
scouts
had
seen
the
gleam
of
metal
two
policemen
in
black
rubber
capes
were
there
what
shape
was
she
in
prine
demanded
one
of
the
men
spat
i
do
think
she
make
it
i
think
she
was
about
gone
she
looked
about
gone
to
me
you
know
the
way
they
all
look
just
about
breathing
color
of
putty
pretty
banged
up
prine
whirled
toward
me
all
right
we
got
her
now
how
about
fitzmartin
start
talking
he
dead
how
do
you
know
he
dead
i
killed
him
i
tell
you
the
rest
later
i
want
to
go
to
the
hospital
fourteen
i
sat
on
a
bench
in
a
in
the
hospital
water
from
my
sodden
clothing
dripped
onto
the
floor
captain
marion
sat
beside
me
prine
leaned
against
the
wall
a
man
i
did
know
sat
on
the
other
side
of
me
i
looked
at
the
pattern
of
the
tiles
in
the
floor
as
i
talked
from
time
to
time
they
would
ask
questions
in
a
quiet
voice
i
told
the
complete
truth
i
lied
about
one
thing
only
i
told
them
that
fitzmartin
had
told
me
that
he
had
hidden
grassman
body
in
a
barn
eight
or
ten
miles
south
of
the
city
on
a
side
road
in
a
ruined
barn
near
a
burned
house
marion
nodded
to
prine
he
went
out
to
send
men
out
to
hunt
for
the
barn
he
had
gone
out
once
before
to
send
men
to
the
island
i
had
told
how
to
find
the
cave
and
told
them
what
they
would
find
in
the
cave
i
told
them
they
would
find
the
gun
in
my
car
i
lied
about
grassman
and
i
left
out
what
i
knew
about
antoinette
it
would
do
them
no
good
to
know
about
her
they
would
learn
enough
from
the
redding
police
they
did
not
have
to
know
more
than
that
i
told
them
all
the
rest
why
i
had
come
to
hillston
everything
i
had
seen
and
guessed
everything
fitzmartin
had
said
timmy
dying
statements
all
of
it
the
whole
stinking
mess
it
felt
good
to
tell
about
it
let
me
get
this
straight
howard
marion
said
you
made
a
deal
with
fitzmartin
you
were
going
to
have
the
girl
find
the
money
then
you
were
going
to
turn
it
over
to
fitzmartin
in
return
for
ruth
safety
you
made
that
deal
yourself
you
thought
you
could
handle
it
better
than
we
could
is
that
it
i
thought
that
was
the
only
way
it
could
be
handled
but
he
crossed
me
up
he
followed
us
we
could
have
grabbed
him
when
he
got
to
the
river
we
have
gotten
to
ruth
earlier
if
she
dies
you
going
to
be
responsible
i
looked
at
him
for
the
first
time
in
over
an
hour
i
do
see
it
that
way
did
he
say
how
he
killed
grassman
you
told
us
why
he
did
it
he
hit
him
on
the
head
with
a
piece
of
pipe
what
do
you
think
the
rasi
girl
was
going
to
do
when
you
turned
the
money
over
to
fitzmartin
assuming
that
it
went
the
way
you
thought
it
would
go
i
guess
she
would
have
liked
it
why
did
she
come
and
get
the
money
herself
once
she
knew
where
it
probably
was
i
have
any
idea
i
think
she
felt
she
needed
help
i
think
she
decided
i
could
help
her
i
think
she
planned
to
get
away
with
all
of
it
somehow
after
we
were
both
well
away
from
here
when
i
was
sleeping
something
like
that
i
think
she
thought
she
could
handle
me
pretty
easily
how
many
shots
did
he
fire
into
the
cave
i
was
counting
maybe
twenty
a
doctor
came
into
the
room
marion
stood
up
what
the
score
dan
the
doctor
looked
at
us
disapprovingly
it
was
as
though
we
were
responsible
for
what
had
happened
to
ruth
i
think
i
can
say
that
physically
she
be
all
right
she
young
and
she
has
a
good
body
she
might
mend
quite
rapidly
it
hard
to
say
it
will
depend
on
her
mental
condition
i
ca
answer
for
that
i
seldom
seen
anyone
handled
more
brutally
i
can
give
you
a
list
dislocated
thumb
broken
shoulder
two
cracked
ribs
a
cracked
pelvis
she
was
criminally
attacked
two
broken
toes
we
nearly
missed
those
she
was
beaten
about
the
face
that
would
have
killed
her
it
was
the
shock
and
exposure
that
nearly
did
it
came
awfully
close
to
doing
it
she
been
treated
for
shock
she
out
of
her
head
she
know
where
she
is
we
just
put
her
to
sleep
i
say
i
ca
estimate
mental
damage
i
stood
up
where
is
she
the
doctor
stared
at
me
i
ca
let
you
see
her
there
no
point
in
seeing
her
i
moved
closer
to
him
i
want
to
see
her
he
stared
at
me
and
then
took
my
wrist
put
his
finger
tips
on
my
pulse
he
took
a
pencil
flashlight
out
of
his
pocket
and
shone
it
directly
into
my
eye
from
a
few
inches
away
he
turned
to
the
captain
this
man
should
be
in
bed
marion
sighed
have
you
got
a
bed
yes
okay
i
have
to
put
a
guard
on
the
door
this
man
is
under
arrest
but
look
just
let
him
look
in
the
door
at
ruth
maybe
he
earned
that
much
i
do
know
they
let
me
look
she
was
in
a
private
room
her
father
sat
near
the
bed
he
did
look
toward
the
doorway
he
watched
her
face
she
was
no
one
i
would
have
ever
recognized
she
was
puffy
discolored
she
breathed
heavily
through
her
open
mouth
there
was
an
odor
of
sickness
in
the
room
i
looked
at
her
and
i
thought
of
the
movie
heroines
they
go
through
terror
and
capture
and
violence
yet
four
minutes
after
rescue
they
melt
with
glossy
hair
and
limpid
eyes
and
gown
by
dior
into
the
arms
of
lancaster
or
gable
or
brando
this
was
reality
the
pain
and
ugliness
and
sickness
of
reality
they
took
me
away
the
formalities
were
complicated
i
had
to
appear
and
be
questioned
at
the
joint
inquest
i
told
all
i
knew
of
the
deaths
of
antoinette
christina
rasi
and
earl
david
fitzmartin
i
signed
six
copies
of
my
detailed
statement
the
final
verdict
was
justifiable
homicide
i
had
killed
in
defense
of
my
life
both
the
money
found
in
fitzmartin
car
and
the
money
in
the
cave
became
a
part
of
george
warden
estate
a
second
cousin
and
his
wife
flew
in
from
houston
to
protect
their
claim
to
the
money
and
whatever
else
there
was
they
arrived
on
sunday
george
and
eloise
warden
were
buried
in
the
warden
family
plot
fulton
identified
through
his
dental
work
was
sent
to
chicago
for
his
third
burial
no
relative
of
fitzmartin
could
be
found
the
county
buried
him
grassman
body
was
found
his
brother
flew
down
from
chicago
and
took
the
body
back
on
the
train
i
had
told
them
about
antoinette
clothes
and
jewelry
and
the
money
the
precise
amount
that
fitzmartin
had
taken
the
court
appointed
an
executor
for
antoinette
rasi
estate
and
directed
that
the
clothing
and
furs
and
jewels
be
sold
and
made
an
informal
suggestion
to
the
executor
that
the
funds
be
used
for
the
doyle
children
when
something
is
dropped
and
broken
the
pieces
have
to
be
picked
up
the
mess
has
to
be
cleaned
up
they
were
through
with
me
on
tuesday
captain
marion
walked
down
the
steps
of
the
courthouse
with
me
we
stood
on
the
sidewalk
in
the
sunshine
you
through
here
howard
we
through
with
you
there
are
some
charges
we
could
have
made
stick
but
we
did
you
can
be
damn
glad
we
do
want
you
here
we
do
want
to
see
you
back
here
i
not
leaving
he
stared
at
me
his
eyes
were
cold
i
do
think
that
very
bright
i
going
to
stay
i
think
i
know
what
on
your
mind
but
it
wo
work
you
spent
all
the
time
you
could
with
her
it
has
worked
has
it
it
work
for
you
not
with
her
i
want
to
stay
and
try
i
made
my
peace
with
her
father
he
understands
i
ca
say
he
approves
but
he
understands
enough
so
he
is
trying
to
drive
me
off
you
beating
your
head
against
a
wall
maybe
prine
wants
to
run
you
out
of
town
do
you
actually
his
face
flushed
stay
then
dammit
stay
it
will
do
you
no
good
i
went
back
to
the
hospital
because
of
her
private
room
visiting
hours
were
less
restricted
i
waited
while
the
nurse
went
to
her
the
nurse
came
back
each
time
i
was
afraid
the
nurse
would
say
i
see
her
she
see
you
in
five
minutes
mr
howard
thank
you
i
waited
they
told
me
when
it
was
time
i
went
to
her
room
as
before
and
pulled
the
chair
up
to
the
bed
her
face
was
not
as
swollen
but
it
was
still
badly
discolored
as
before
she
turned
her
face
toward
the
wall
she
had
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
without
expression
before
turning
away
she
had
not
yet
spoken
to
me
but
i
had
spoken
to
her
i
had
talked
to
her
for
hours
i
had
told
her
everything
i
had
told
her
what
she
meant
to
me
and
had
received
no
response
at
all
it
was
like
talking
to
a
wall
the
only
encouragement
was
her
letting
me
see
her
at
all
the
doctor
had
told
me
she
would
recover
more
quickly
if
she
could
recover
from
her
listlessness
her
depression
as
on
other
days
i
talked
i
could
not
tell
if
she
was
listening
i
had
told
her
all
there
was
to
tell
about
the
things
that
had
happened
there
was
no
point
in
repeating
it
no
point
in
begging
for
understanding
or
forgiveness
so
i
talked
of
other
things
and
other
days
places
i
had
been
i
told
her
about
tokyo
about
pusan
about
the
hospital
i
told
her
about
the
work
i
used
to
do
i
conjectured
out
loud
about
what
i
could
find
to
do
in
hillston
i
still
had
seven
hundred
dollars
left
i
was
careful
not
to
ask
questions
i
did
not
want
it
to
seem
to
her
as
though
i
were
angling
for
a
response
she
lay
with
her
face
turned
toward
the
wall
for
all
i
knew
she
could
be
asleep
and
then
suddenly
surprisingly
her
hand
came
timidly
from
the
cover
of
the
hospital
blanket
it
reached
blindly
toward
me
and
i
took
her
hand
in
both
of
mine
she
squeezed
my
hand
hard
once
and
then
let
her
hand
lie
in
mine
that
was
the
sign
that
was
enough
the
rest
of
it
would
come
now
it
was
just
a
matter
of
time
there
would
be
a
day
when
there
would
be
laughter
when
she
would
walk
again
in
that
proud
way
of
hers
all
this
would
fade
and
it
would
be
right
for
her
and
for
me
we
both
had
a
lot
of
forgetting
to
do
and
we
could
do
it
better
together
this
was
the
woman
i
wanted
i
could
never
be
driven
away
this
was
treasure
a
bullet
for
cinderella
her
veneer
was
big
city
but
one
look
and
you
knew
that
toni
raselle
instincts
were
straight
out
of
the
river
shack
she
came
from
i
watched
her
as
she
toyed
with
the
man
laughing
her
tumbled
hair
like
raw
silk
her
brown
shoulders
bare
eyes
a
girl
with
a
gypsy
look
so
this
was
the
girl
i
had
risked
my
life
to
find
this
was
the
girl
who
was
going
to
lead
me
to
a
buried
fortune
