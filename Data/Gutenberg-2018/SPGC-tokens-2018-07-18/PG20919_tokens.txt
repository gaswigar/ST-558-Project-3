chapter
one
his
return
to
consciousness
was
a
slow
and
painful
process
it
was
a
journey
in
which
he
traversed
all
time
he
dreamed
he
rose
through
thick
layers
of
sleep
out
of
the
imaginary
beginnings
of
all
things
he
lifted
a
pseudopod
from
primordial
ooze
and
the
pseudopod
was
he
became
an
amoeba
which
contained
essence
then
a
fish
marked
with
his
own
peculiar
individuality
then
an
ape
unlike
all
other
apes
and
finally
he
became
a
man
what
kind
of
man
dimly
he
saw
himself
faceless
a
beamer
gripped
tight
on
one
hand
a
corpse
at
his
feet
kind
of
man
he
awoke
rubbed
his
eyes
and
waited
for
further
memories
to
come
no
memories
came
not
even
his
name
he
sat
up
hastily
and
willed
memory
to
return
when
it
did
he
looked
around
seeking
in
his
surroundings
some
clue
to
his
identity
he
was
sitting
on
a
bed
in
a
small
gray
room
there
was
a
closed
door
on
one
side
on
the
other
through
a
curtained
alcove
he
could
see
a
tiny
lavatory
light
came
into
the
room
from
some
hidden
source
perhaps
from
the
ceiling
itself
the
room
had
a
bed
and
a
single
chair
and
nothing
else
he
held
his
chin
in
his
hand
and
closed
his
eyes
he
tried
to
catalogue
all
his
knowledge
and
the
implications
of
that
knowledge
he
knew
that
he
was
a
man
species
homo
sapiens
an
inhabitant
of
the
planet
earth
he
spoke
a
language
which
he
knew
was
english
did
that
mean
that
there
were
other
languages
he
knew
the
commonplace
names
for
things
room
light
chair
he
possessed
in
addition
a
limited
amount
of
general
knowledge
he
knew
that
there
were
many
important
things
which
he
did
not
know
which
he
once
had
known
must
have
happened
to
that
something
could
have
been
worse
if
it
had
gone
a
little
further
he
might
have
been
left
a
mindless
creature
without
a
language
unaware
of
being
human
of
being
a
man
of
being
of
earth
a
certain
amount
had
been
left
to
him
but
when
he
tried
to
think
beyond
the
basic
facts
in
his
possession
he
came
to
a
dark
and
area
not
exploration
into
his
own
mind
was
as
dangerous
as
a
journey
to
what
he
could
find
an
analogue
though
he
suspected
that
many
existed
must
have
been
that
was
the
only
reasonable
explanation
he
was
a
man
with
the
recollection
of
memories
he
must
at
one
time
have
had
that
priceless
wealth
of
recall
which
now
he
could
only
deduce
from
the
limited
evidence
at
his
disposal
at
one
time
he
must
have
had
specific
memories
of
birds
trees
friends
family
status
a
wife
perhaps
now
he
could
only
theorize
about
them
once
he
had
been
able
to
say
this
is
like
or
that
reminds
me
of
now
nothing
reminded
him
of
anything
and
things
were
only
like
themselves
he
had
lost
his
powers
of
contrast
and
comparison
he
could
no
longer
analyze
the
present
in
terms
of
the
experienced
past
must
be
a
of
course
he
was
being
cared
for
in
this
place
kindly
doctors
were
working
to
restore
his
memory
to
replace
his
identity
to
restore
his
judgment
apparatus
to
tell
him
who
and
what
he
was
it
was
very
good
of
them
he
felt
tears
of
gratitude
start
in
his
eyes
he
stood
up
and
walked
slowly
around
his
small
room
he
went
to
the
door
and
found
it
locked
that
locked
door
gave
him
a
moment
of
panic
which
he
sternly
controlled
perhaps
he
had
been
violent
well
he
would
be
violent
any
more
they
see
they
would
award
him
all
possible
patient
privileges
he
would
speak
about
that
with
the
doctor
he
waited
after
a
long
time
he
heard
footsteps
coming
down
the
corridor
outside
his
door
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
cot
and
listened
trying
to
control
his
excitement
the
footsteps
stopped
beside
his
door
a
panel
slid
open
and
a
face
peered
in
how
are
you
feeling
the
man
asked
he
walked
up
to
the
panel
and
saw
that
the
man
who
questioned
him
was
dressed
in
a
brown
uniform
he
had
an
object
on
his
waist
which
could
be
identified
after
a
moment
as
a
weapon
this
man
was
undoubtedly
a
guard
he
had
a
blunt
unreadable
face
could
you
tell
me
my
name
he
asked
the
guard
call
yourself
the
guard
said
that
your
cell
number
he
did
like
it
but
was
better
than
nothing
at
all
he
asked
the
guard
have
i
been
sick
for
long
am
i
getting
better
yes
the
guard
said
in
a
voice
that
carried
no
conviction
the
important
thing
is
stay
quiet
obey
the
rules
that
the
best
way
certainly
said
but
why
ca
i
remember
anything
well
that
the
way
it
goes
the
guard
said
he
started
to
walk
away
called
after
him
wait
you
ca
just
leave
me
like
this
you
have
to
tell
me
something
what
happened
to
me
why
am
i
in
this
hospital
hospital
the
guard
said
he
turned
toward
and
grinned
what
gave
you
the
idea
this
was
a
hospital
i
assumed
it
said
you
assumed
wrong
this
is
a
prison
remembered
his
dream
of
the
murdered
man
dream
or
memory
desperately
he
called
after
the
guard
what
was
my
offense
what
did
i
do
you
find
out
the
guard
said
when
after
we
land
the
guard
said
now
get
ready
for
assembly
he
walked
away
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
tried
to
think
he
had
learned
a
few
things
he
was
in
a
prison
and
the
prison
was
going
to
land
what
did
that
mean
why
did
a
prison
have
to
land
and
what
was
an
assembly
had
only
a
confused
idea
of
what
happened
next
an
unmeasurable
amount
of
time
passed
he
was
sitting
on
his
bed
trying
to
piece
together
facts
about
himself
he
had
an
impression
of
bells
ringing
and
then
the
door
of
his
cell
flew
open
why
was
that
what
did
it
mean
walked
to
the
door
and
peered
into
the
corridor
he
was
very
excited
but
he
did
want
to
leave
the
security
of
his
cell
he
waited
and
the
guard
came
up
all
right
now
the
guard
said
no
one
going
to
hurt
you
go
straight
down
the
corridor
the
guard
pushed
him
gently
walked
down
the
corridor
he
saw
other
cell
doors
opening
other
men
coming
into
the
corridor
it
was
a
thin
stream
at
first
but
as
he
continued
walking
more
and
more
men
crowded
into
the
passageway
most
of
them
looked
bewildered
and
none
of
them
talked
the
only
words
were
from
the
guards
move
along
now
keep
on
moving
straight
ahead
they
were
headed
into
a
large
circular
auditorium
looking
around
saw
that
a
balcony
ran
around
the
room
and
armed
guards
were
stationed
every
few
yards
along
it
their
presence
seemed
unnecessary
these
cowed
and
bewildered
men
were
going
to
stage
a
revolt
still
he
supposed
the
guards
had
a
symbolic
value
they
reminded
the
newly
awakened
men
of
the
most
important
fact
of
their
lives
that
they
were
prisoners
after
a
few
minutes
a
man
in
a
somber
uniform
stepped
out
on
the
balcony
he
held
up
his
hand
for
attention
although
the
prisoners
were
already
watching
him
fixedly
then
though
he
had
no
visible
means
of
amplification
his
voice
boomed
hollowly
through
the
auditorium
this
is
an
indoctrination
talk
he
said
listen
carefully
and
try
to
absorb
what
i
am
about
to
tell
you
these
facts
will
be
very
important
for
your
existence
the
prisoners
watched
him
the
speaker
said
all
of
you
have
within
the
last
hour
awakened
in
your
cells
you
have
discovered
that
you
can
not
remember
your
former
lives
not
even
your
names
all
you
possess
is
a
meager
store
of
generalized
knowledge
enough
to
keep
you
in
touch
with
reality
i
will
not
add
to
your
knowledge
all
of
you
back
on
earth
were
vicious
and
depraved
criminals
you
were
people
of
the
worst
sort
men
who
had
forfeited
any
right
to
consideration
by
the
state
in
a
less
enlightened
age
you
would
have
been
executed
in
our
age
you
have
been
deported
the
speaker
held
out
his
hands
to
quiet
the
murmur
that
ran
through
the
auditorium
he
said
all
of
you
are
criminals
and
all
of
you
have
one
thing
in
common
an
inability
to
obey
the
basic
obligatory
rules
of
human
society
those
rules
are
necessary
for
civilization
to
function
by
disobeying
them
you
have
committed
crimes
against
all
mankind
therefore
mankind
rejects
you
you
are
grit
in
the
machinery
of
civilization
and
you
have
been
sent
to
a
world
where
your
own
sort
is
king
here
you
can
make
your
own
rules
and
die
by
them
here
is
the
freedom
you
lusted
for
the
uncontained
and
freedom
of
a
cancerous
growth
the
speaker
wiped
his
forehead
and
glared
earnestly
at
the
prisoners
but
perhaps
he
said
a
rehabilitation
is
possible
for
some
of
you
omega
the
planet
to
which
we
are
going
is
planet
a
place
ruled
entirely
by
prisoners
it
is
a
world
where
you
could
begin
again
with
no
prejudices
against
you
with
a
clean
record
your
past
lives
are
forgotten
do
try
to
remember
them
such
memories
would
serve
only
to
restimulate
your
criminal
tendencies
consider
yourselves
born
afresh
as
of
the
moment
of
awakening
in
your
cells
the
speaker
slow
measured
words
had
a
certain
hypnotic
quality
listened
his
eyes
slightly
unfocused
and
fixed
upon
the
speaker
pale
forehead
a
new
world
the
speaker
was
saying
you
are
reborn
but
with
the
necessary
consciousness
of
sin
without
it
you
would
be
unable
to
combat
the
evil
inherent
in
your
personalities
remember
that
remember
that
there
is
no
escape
and
no
return
guardships
armed
with
the
latest
beam
weapons
patrol
the
skies
of
omega
day
and
night
these
ships
are
designed
to
obliterate
anything
that
rises
more
than
five
hundred
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
planet
an
invincible
barrier
through
which
no
prisoner
can
ever
pass
accommodate
yourselves
to
these
facts
they
constitute
the
rules
which
must
govern
your
lives
think
about
what
i
said
and
now
stand
by
for
landing
the
speaker
left
the
balcony
for
a
while
the
prisoners
simply
stared
at
the
spot
where
he
had
been
then
tentatively
a
murmur
of
conversation
began
after
a
while
it
died
away
there
was
nothing
to
talk
about
the
prisoners
without
memory
of
the
past
had
nothing
upon
which
to
base
a
speculation
of
the
future
personalities
could
not
be
exchanged
for
those
personalities
were
newly
emerged
and
still
undefined
they
sat
in
silence
uncommunicative
men
who
had
been
too
long
in
solitary
confinement
the
guards
on
the
balcony
stood
like
statues
remote
and
impersonal
and
then
the
faintest
tremor
ran
through
the
floor
of
the
auditorium
the
tremor
came
again
then
it
changed
into
a
definite
vibration
felt
heavier
as
though
an
invisible
weight
were
pressing
against
his
head
and
shoulders
a
loudspeaker
voice
called
out
attention
the
ship
is
now
landing
on
omega
we
will
disembark
shortly
the
last
vibration
died
away
and
the
floor
beneath
them
gave
a
slight
lurch
the
prisoners
still
silent
and
dazed
were
formed
into
a
long
line
and
marched
out
of
the
auditorium
flanked
by
guards
they
went
down
a
corridor
which
stretched
on
interminably
from
it
began
to
get
some
idea
of
the
size
of
the
ship
far
ahead
he
could
see
a
patch
of
sunlight
which
shone
brightly
against
the
pale
illumination
of
the
corridor
his
section
of
the
long
shuffling
line
reached
the
sunlight
and
saw
that
it
came
from
an
open
hatchway
through
which
the
prisoners
were
passing
in
his
turn
went
through
the
hatchway
climbed
down
a
long
stairway
and
found
himself
on
solid
ground
he
was
standing
in
an
open
sunlit
square
guards
were
forming
the
disembarked
prisoners
into
files
on
all
sides
could
see
a
crowd
of
spectators
watching
a
loudspeaker
voice
boomed
answer
when
your
number
is
called
your
identity
will
now
be
revealed
to
you
answer
promptly
when
your
number
is
called
felt
weak
and
very
tired
not
even
his
identity
could
interest
him
now
all
he
wanted
to
do
was
lie
down
to
sleep
to
have
a
chance
to
think
about
his
situation
he
looked
around
and
took
casual
note
of
the
huge
starcraft
behind
him
of
the
guards
the
spectators
overhead
he
saw
black
dots
moving
against
a
blue
sky
at
first
he
thought
they
were
birds
then
looking
closer
he
saw
they
were
guardships
he
particularly
interested
in
them
number
speak
out
here
a
voice
answered
number
your
name

southholder
age

type
index
guilty
of

when
the
voice
had
finished
a
loud
cheer
came
up
from
the
crowd
they
were
applauding
the
prisoner
traitorous
actions
and
welcoming
him
to
omega
the
names
were
read
down
the
list
and
drowsy
in
the
sunshine
dozed
on
his
feet
and
listened
to
the
crimes
of
murder
credit
theft
deviationalism
and
mutantism
at
last
his
number
was
called
number
here
number
your

age

type

guilty

the
crowd
cheered
but
scarcely
heard
them
he
was
trying
to
accustom
himself
to
the
idea
of
having
a
name
a
real
name
instead
of
a
number
will
barrent
he
hoped
he
would
forget
it
he
repeated
the
name
to
himself
over
and
over
again
and
almost
missed
the
last
announcement
from
the
ship
loudspeaker
the
new
men
are
now
released
upon
omega
you
will
be
given
temporary
housing

be
cautious
and
circumspect
in
your

and
learn
the
law
requires
me
to
tell
you
that
the
average
life
expectancy
on
omega
is
approximately
three
earth
years
it
took
a
while
for
those
last
words
to
take
effect
on
barrent
he
was
still
contemplating
the
novelty
of
having
a
name
he
had
considered
any
of
the
implications
of
being
a
murderer
on
an
underworld
planet
chapter
two
the
new
prisoners
were
led
to
a
row
of
barracks
at
square
there
were
nearly
five
hundred
of
them
they
were
not
yet
men
they
were
entities
whose
true
memories
extended
barely
an
hour
in
time
sitting
on
their
bunks
the
newborns
looked
curiously
at
their
bodies
examined
with
sharp
interest
their
hands
and
feet
they
stared
at
each
other
and
saw
their
formlessness
mirrored
in
each
other
eyes
they
were
not
yet
men
but
they
were
not
children
either
certain
abstractions
remained
and
the
ghosts
of
memories
maturation
came
quickly
born
of
old
habit
patterns
and
personality
traits
retained
in
the
broken
threads
of
their
former
lives
on
earth
the
new
men
clung
to
the
vague
recollections
of
concepts
ideas
rules
within
a
few
hours
their
phlegmatic
blandness
had
begun
to
pass
they
were
becoming
men
now
individuals
out
of
a
dazed
and
superficial
conformity
sharp
differences
began
to
emerge
character
reasserted
itself
and
the
five
hundred
began
to
discover
what
they
were
will
barrent
stood
in
line
for
a
look
at
himself
in
the
barracks
mirror
when
his
turn
came
he
saw
the
reflection
of
a
young
man
with
straight
brown
hair
the
young
man
had
a
resolute
honest
unexceptional
face
unmarked
by
any
strong
passion
barrent
turned
away
disappointed
it
was
the
face
of
a
stranger
later
examining
himself
more
closely
he
could
find
no
scars
or
anything
else
to
distinguish
his
body
from
a
thousand
other
bodies
his
hands
were
uncallused
he
was
wiry
rather
than
muscular
he
wondered
what
sort
of
work
he
had
done
on
earth
murder
he
frowned
he
was
ready
to
accept
that
a
man
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
how
you
feeling
barrent
turned
and
saw
a
large
man
standing
beside
him
pretty
good
barrent
said
you
were
in
line
behind
me
were
you
that
right
number
name
danis
foeren
barrent
introduced
himself
your
crime
foeren
asked
murder
foeren
nodded
looking
impressed
me
i
a
forger
would
think
it
to
look
at
my
hands
he
held
out
two
massive
paws
covered
with
sparse
red
hair
but
the
skill
there
my
hands
remembered
before
any
other
part
of
me
on
the
ship
i
sat
in
my
cell
and
looked
at
my
hands
they
itched
they
wanted
to
be
off
and
doing
things
but
the
rest
of
me
could
remember
what
what
did
you
do
barrent
asked
i
closed
my
eyes
and
let
my
hands
take
over
foeren
said
first
thing
i
knew
they
were
up
and
picking
the
lock
of
the
cell
he
held
up
his
huge
hands
and
looked
at
them
admiringly
clever
little
devils
picking
the
lock
barrent
asked
but
i
thought
you
were
a
forger
well
now
foeren
said
forgery
was
my
main
line
but
a
pair
of
skilled
hands
can
do
almost
anything
i
suspect
that
i
was
only
for
forgery
but
i
might
also
have
been
a
safeman
my
hands
know
too
much
for
just
a
forger
you
found
out
more
about
yourself
than
i
have
barrent
said
all
i
have
to
start
with
is
a
dream
well
that
a
start
foeren
said
there
must
be
ways
of
finding
out
more
the
important
thing
is
we
on
omega
agreed
barrent
said
sourly
nothing
wrong
with
that
foeren
said
did
you
hear
what
the
man
said
this
is
our
planet
with
an
average
life
expectancy
of
three
earth
years
barrent
reminded
him
that
probably
just
scare
talk
foeren
said
i
would
believe
stuff
like
that
from
a
guard
the
big
thing
is
we
have
our
own
planet
you
heard
what
they
said
rejects
us
nova
earth
who
needs
her
we
our
own
planet
here
a
whole
planet
barrent
we
free
another
man
said
that
right
friend
he
was
small
and
ingratiatingly
friendly
my
name
is
joe
he
told
them
actually
the
name
is
joao
but
i
prefer
the
archaic
form
with
its
flavor
of
more
gracious
times
gentlemen
i
could
help
overhearing
your
conversation
and
i
agree
most
heartily
with
our
friend
consider
the
possibilities
earth
has
cast
us
aside
excellent
we
are
better
off
without
her
we
are
all
equal
here
free
men
in
a
free
society
no
uniforms
no
guards
no
soldiers
just
repentant
former
criminals
who
want
to
live
in
peace
what
did
they
get
you
for
barrent
asked
they
said
i
was
a
credit
thief
joe
said
i
ashamed
to
admit
that
i
ca
remember
what
a
credit
thief
is
but
perhaps
it
come
back
to
me
maybe
the
authorities
have
some
sort
of
memory
retraining
system
foeren
said
authorities
joe
said
indignantly
what
do
you
mean
authorities
this
is
planet
we
all
equal
here
by
definition
there
be
any
authorities
no
friends
we
left
all
that
nonsense
behind
on
earth
here
we
he
stopped
abruptly
the
barracks
door
had
opened
and
a
man
walked
in
he
was
evidently
an
older
resident
of
omega
since
he
lacked
the
gray
prison
uniform
he
was
fat
and
dressed
in
garish
yellow
and
blue
clothing
on
a
belt
around
his
ample
waist
he
carried
a
holstered
pistol
and
a
knife
he
stood
just
inside
the
doorway
his
hands
on
his
hips
glaring
at
the
new
arrivals
well
he
said
do
you
new
men
recognize
a
quaestor
stand
up
none
of
the
men
moved
the
quaestor
face
went
scarlet
i
guess
i
have
to
teach
you
a
little
respect
even
before
he
had
taken
his
weapon
from
its
holster
the
new
arrivals
had
scrambled
to
their
feet
the
quaestor
looked
at
them
with
a
faintly
regretful
air
and
pushed
the
weapon
back
in
its
holster
the
first
thing
you
men
better
learn
the
quaestor
said
is
your
status
on
omega
your
status
is
you
peons
and
that
means
you
he
waited
a
moment
and
then
said
now
pay
attention
peons
you
are
about
to
be
instructed
in
your
duties
chapter
three
the
first
thing
you
new
men
should
understand
the
quaestor
said
is
just
exactly
what
you
are
that
very
important
and
i
tell
you
what
you
are
you
you
the
lowest
of
the
low
there
nothing
lower
except
mutants
and
they
really
human
any
questions
the
quaestor
waited
when
there
were
no
questions
he
said
defined
what
are
from
that
we
proceed
to
a
basic
understanding
of
what
everybody
else
on
omega
is
first
of
all
is
more
important
than
you
but
some
are
more
important
than
others
next
above
you
in
rank
is
the
resident
who
hardly
counts
for
more
than
any
of
you
and
then
there
the
free
citizen
he
wears
a
gray
finger
ring
of
status
and
his
clothes
are
black
he
is
important
either
but
he
much
more
important
than
you
with
luck
some
of
you
may
become
free
citizens
next
are
the
privileged
classes
all
distinguished
by
various
recognition
symbols
according
to
rank
such
as
the
golden
earrings
for
example
of
the
hadji
class
eventually
you
learn
all
the
marks
and
prerogatives
of
the
various
ranks
and
degrees
i
might
also
mention
the
priests
even
though
they
not
of
privileged
rank
they
granted
certain
immunities
and
rights
have
i
made
myself
clear
everyone
in
the
barracks
mumbled
assent
the
quaestor
continued
now
we
come
to
the
subject
of
deportment
when
meeting
anyone
of
superior
rank
as
peons
you
are
obliged
to
greet
a
free
citizen
by
his
full
title
in
a
respectful
manner
with
privileged
ranks
such
as
hadjis
you
speak
only
when
spoken
to
and
then
you
stand
with
eyes
downcast
and
hands
clasped
in
front
of
you
you
do
not
leave
the
presence
of
a
privileged
citizen
until
permission
has
been
granted
you
do
not
sit
in
his
company
under
any
circumstances
understood
there
is
much
more
to
be
learned
my
office
of
quaestor
for
example
comes
under
the
classification
of
free
citizen
but
carries
certain
of
the
prerogatives
of
privilege
the
quaestor
glared
at
the
men
to
make
sure
they
understood
this
barracks
is
your
temporary
home
i
have
drawn
up
a
chart
to
show
which
men
sweep
which
wash
and
so
forth
you
may
question
me
at
anytime
but
foolish
or
impertinent
questions
can
be
punished
by
mutilation
or
death
just
remember
that
you
are
the
lowest
of
the
low
if
you
bear
that
in
mind
you
might
be
able
to
stay
alive
the
quaestor
stood
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
then
he
said
over
the
next
few
days
you
all
be
given
various
assignments
some
of
you
will
go
to
the
germanium
mines
some
to
the
fishing
fleet
some
will
be
apprenticed
to
various
trades
in
the
meantime
you
free
to
look
around
tetrahyde
when
the
men
looked
blank
the
quaestor
explained
tetrahyde
is
the
name
of
the
city
you
in
it
the
largest
city
on
omega
he
thought
for
a
moment
in
fact
it
the
only
city
on
omega
what
does
the
name
tetrahyde
mean
joe
asked
how
should
i
know
the
quaestor
said
scowling
i
suppose
it
one
of
those
old
earth
names
the
skrenners
are
always
coming
up
with
anyhow
just
watch
your
step
when
you
enter
it
why
barrent
asked
the
quaestor
grinned
that
peon
is
something
you
have
to
find
out
for
yourself
he
turned
and
strode
from
the
barracks
when
he
had
gone
barrent
went
to
the
window
from
it
he
could
see
a
deserted
square
and
beyond
the
streets
of
tetrahyde
you
thinking
of
going
out
there
joe
asked
certainly
i
am
barrent
said
coming
with
me
the
little
credit
thief
shook
his
head
i
do
think
it
safe
foeren
how
about
you
i
do
like
it
either
foeren
said
might
be
better
to
stay
around
the
barracks
for
a
while
that
ridiculous
barrent
said
it
city
now
is
anyone
coming
with
me
looking
uncomfortable
foeren
hunched
his
big
shoulders
and
shook
his
head
joe
shrugged
and
lay
back
on
his
cot
the
rest
of
the
new
men
did
even
look
up
very
well
barrent
said
i
give
you
a
full
report
later
he
waited
a
moment
longer
in
case
someone
changed
his
mind
then
went
out
the
door
the
city
of
tetrahyde
was
a
collection
of
buildings
sprawled
along
a
narrow
peninsula
which
jutted
into
a
sluggish
gray
sea
the
landward
side
was
contained
by
a
high
stone
wall
pierced
with
gates
and
guarded
by
sentries
its
largest
building
was
the
arena
used
once
a
year
for
the
games
near
the
arena
was
a
small
cluster
of
government
buildings
barrent
walked
along
the
narrow
streets
staring
around
him
trying
to
get
some
idea
of
what
his
new
home
was
like
the
winding
unpaved
roads
and
dark
weatherbeaten
houses
stirred
an
elusive
of
memory
in
him
he
had
seen
a
place
like
this
on
earth
but
he
could
remember
anything
about
it
the
recollection
was
as
tantalizing
as
an
itch
but
he
could
locate
its
source
past
the
arena
he
came
into
the
main
business
district
of
tetrahyde
fascinated
he
read
the
store
signs
unlicensed
doctor
abortions
performed
further
on
disbarred
lawyer
political
pull
this
seemed
vaguely
wrong
to
barrent
he
walked
further
past
stores
advertising
stolen
goods
past
a
little
shop
that
announced
mind
reading
full
staff
of
skrenning
mutants
your
past
on
earth
revealed
barrent
was
tempted
to
go
in
but
he
remembered
that
he
had
any
money
and
omega
seemed
like
the
sort
of
place
that
put
a
high
value
on
money
he
turned
down
a
side
street
walked
by
several
restaurants
and
came
to
a
large
building
called
the
poison
institute
terms
up
to
years
to
pay
satisfaction
guaranteed
or
your
money
next
door
to
it
was
the
assassin
guild
on
the
basis
of
the
indoctrination
talk
on
the
prison
ship
barrent
had
expected
omega
to
be
dedicated
to
the
rehabilitation
of
criminals
to
judge
by
the
store
signs
this
simply
was
so
or
if
it
was
rehabilitation
took
some
very
strange
forms
he
walked
on
more
slowly
deep
in
thought
then
he
noticed
that
people
were
moving
out
of
his
way
they
glanced
at
him
and
ducked
in
doorways
and
stores
an
elderly
woman
took
one
look
at
him
and
ran
what
was
wrong
could
it
be
his
prison
uniform
no
the
people
of
omega
had
seen
many
of
those
what
was
it
then
the
street
was
almost
deserted
a
shopkeeper
near
him
was
hurriedly
swinging
steel
shutters
over
his
display
of
fencing
equipment
what
the
matter
barrent
asked
him
what
going
on
are
you
out
of
your
head
the
shopkeeper
said
it
landing
day
i
beg
your
pardon
landing
day
the
shopkeeper
said
the
day
the
prison
ship
landed
get
back
to
your
barracks
you
idiot
he
slammed
the
last
steel
shutter
into
place
and
locked
it
barrent
felt
a
sudden
cold
touch
of
fear
something
was
very
wrong
he
had
better
get
back
in
a
hurry
it
had
been
stupid
of
him
not
to
find
out
more
about
omegan
customs
before
three
men
were
walking
down
the
street
toward
him
they
were
well
dressed
and
each
wore
the
small
golden
hadji
earring
in
his
left
ear
all
three
men
carried
sidearms
barrent
started
to
walk
away
from
them
one
of
the
men
shouted
stop
peon
barrent
saw
that
the
man
hand
was
dangling
near
his
gun
he
stopped
and
said
what
the
matter
it
landing
day
the
man
said
he
looked
at
his
friends
well
who
gets
him
first
we
choose
here
a
coin
no
a
show
of
fingers
ready
one
two
three
he
mine
said
the
hadji
on
the
left
his
friends
moved
back
as
he
drew
his
sidearm
wait
barrent
called
out
what
are
you
doing
i
going
to
shoot
you
the
man
said
but
why
the
man
smiled
because
it
a
hadji
privilege
on
every
landing
day
we
have
the
right
to
shoot
down
any
new
peon
who
leaves
his
barracks
area
but
i
was
told
of
course
not
the
man
said
if
you
new
men
were
told
none
of
you
would
leave
your
barracks
on
landing
day
and
that
would
spoil
all
the
fun
he
took
aim
barrent
reacted
instantaneously
he
threw
himself
to
the
ground
as
the
hadji
fired
heard
a
hiss
and
saw
a
jagged
heatburn
score
the
brick
building
next
to
which
he
had
been
standing
my
turn
now
one
of
the
men
said
sorry
old
man
i
believe
it
mine
seniority
dear
friend
has
its
privileges
stand
clear
before
the
next
man
could
take
aim
barrent
was
on
his
feet
and
running
the
sharply
winding
street
protected
him
for
the
moment
but
he
could
hear
the
sounds
of
his
pursuers
behind
him
they
were
running
at
an
easy
stride
almost
a
fast
walk
as
if
they
were
completely
sure
of
their
prey
barrent
put
on
a
burst
of
speed
turned
down
a
side
street
and
knew
immediately
he
had
made
a
mistake
he
was
facing
a
dead
end
the
hadjis
moving
at
an
easy
pace
were
coming
up
behind
him
barrent
looked
wildly
around
store
fronts
here
were
all
locked
and
shuttered
there
was
nowhere
he
could
climb
to
no
place
to
hide
and
then
he
saw
an
open
door
halfway
down
the
block
in
the
direction
of
his
pursuers
he
had
run
right
by
it
a
sign
protruding
from
the
building
above
the
doorway
said
the
victim
protective
society
for
me
barrent
thought
he
sprinted
for
it
running
almost
under
the
noses
of
the
startled
hadjis
a
single
gun
blast
scorched
the
ground
under
his
heels
then
he
had
reached
the
doorway
and
flung
himself
inside
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
his
pursuers
had
not
followed
him
he
could
still
hear
their
voices
in
the
street
amiably
arguing
questions
of
precedence
barrent
realized
he
had
entered
some
sort
of
sanctuary
he
was
in
a
large
brightly
lighted
room
several
ragged
men
were
sitting
on
a
bench
near
the
door
laughing
at
a
private
joke
a
little
further
down
a
girl
sat
and
watched
barrent
with
wide
unblinking
green
eyes
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
was
a
desk
with
a
man
sitting
behind
it
the
man
beckoned
to
barrent
he
walked
up
to
the
desk
the
man
behind
it
was
short
and
bespectacled
he
smiled
encouragingly
waiting
for
barrent
to
speak
this
is
the
victim
protective
society
barrent
asked
quite
correct
sir
the
man
said
i
am
rondolp
frendlyer
president
of
this
nonprofit
organization
could
i
be
of
service
you
certainly
could
barrent
said
i
practically
a
victim
i
knew
that
just
by
looking
at
you
frendlyer
said
smiling
warmly
you
have
a
certain
look
a
mixture
of
fear
and
uncertainty
with
just
a
suggestion
of
vulnerability
thrown
in
it
quite
unmistakable
that
very
interesting
barrent
said
glancing
toward
the
door
and
wondering
how
long
his
sanctuary
would
be
respected
frendlyer
not
a
member
of
your
organization
that
does
matter
frendlyer
said
membership
in
our
group
is
necessarily
spontaneous
one
joins
when
the
occasion
arises
our
intention
is
to
protect
the
inalienable
rights
of
all
victims
yes
sir
well
there
are
three
men
outside
trying
to
kill
me
i
see
frendlyer
said
he
opened
a
drawer
and
took
out
a
large
book
he
flipped
through
it
quickly
and
found
the
reference
he
wanted
tell
me
did
you
ascertain
the
status
of
these
men
i
believe
they
were
hadjis
barrent
said
each
of
them
had
a
little
gold
earring
in
his
left
ear
quite
right
frendlyer
said
and
today
is
landing
day
you
came
off
the
ship
that
landed
today
and
have
been
classified
a
peon
is
that
correct
yes
it
is
barrent
said
then
i
happy
to
say
that
everything
is
in
order
the
landing
day
hunt
ends
at
sundown
you
can
leave
here
with
knowledge
that
everything
is
correct
and
that
your
rights
are
in
no
way
being
violated
leave
here
after
sundown
you
mean
frendlyer
shook
his
head
and
smiled
sadly
i
afraid
not
according
to
the
law
you
must
leave
here
at
once
but
they
kill
me
that
very
true
frendlyer
said
unfortunately
it
ca
be
helped
a
victim
by
definition
is
one
who
is
to
be
killed
i
thought
this
was
a
protective
organization
it
is
but
we
protect
not
victims
your
rights
are
not
being
violated
the
hadjis
have
the
privilege
of
killing
you
on
landing
day
at
any
time
before
sundown
if
you
are
not
in
your
barracks
area
you
i
might
add
have
the
right
to
kill
anyone
who
tries
to
kill
you
i
do
have
a
weapon
barrent
said
victims
never
do
frendlyer
said
it
makes
all
the
difference
does
it
but
weapon
or
not
i
afraid
you
have
to
leave
now
barrent
could
still
hear
the
hadjis
lazy
voices
in
the
street
he
asked
have
you
a
rear
door
sorry
then
i
simply
not
leave
still
smiling
frendlyer
opened
a
drawer
and
took
out
a
gun
he
pointed
it
at
barrent
and
said
you
really
must
leave
you
can
take
your
chances
with
the
hadjis
or
you
can
die
right
here
with
no
chance
at
all
lend
me
your
gun
barrent
said
it
is
allowed
frendlyer
told
him
ca
have
victims
running
around
with
weapons
you
know
it
would
upset
things
he
clicked
off
the
safety
are
you
leaving
barrent
calculated
his
chances
of
diving
across
the
desk
for
the
gun
and
decided
he
would
never
make
it
he
turned
and
walked
slowly
to
the
door
the
ragged
men
were
still
laughing
together
the
girl
had
risen
from
the
bench
and
was
standing
near
the
doorway
as
he
came
close
to
her
barrent
noticed
that
she
was
very
lovely
he
wondered
what
crime
had
dictated
her
expulsion
from
earth
as
he
passed
her
he
felt
something
hard
pressed
into
his
ribs
he
reached
for
it
and
found
he
was
holding
a
small
gun
luck
the
girl
said
i
hope
you
know
how
to
use
it
barrent
nodded
his
thanks
he
was
sure
he
knew
how
but
he
was
going
to
find
out
chapter
four
the
street
was
deserted
except
for
the
three
hadjis
who
stood
about
twenty
yards
away
conversing
quietly
as
barrent
came
through
the
doorway
two
of
the
men
moved
back
the
third
his
sidearm
negligently
lowered
stepped
forward
when
he
saw
that
barrent
was
armed
he
quickly
brought
his
gun
into
firing
position
barrent
flung
himself
to
the
ground
and
pressed
the
trigger
of
his
unfamiliar
weapon
he
felt
it
vibrate
in
his
hand
and
saw
the
head
and
shoulders
turn
black
and
begin
to
crumble
before
he
could
take
aim
at
the
other
men
barrent
gun
was
wrenched
violently
from
his
hand
the
hadji
dying
shot
had
creased
the
end
of
the
muzzle
desperately
barrent
dived
for
the
gun
knowing
he
could
never
reach
it
in
time
his
skin
pricked
in
expectation
of
the
killing
shot
he
rolled
to
his
gun
still
miraculously
alive
and
took
aim
at
the
nearest
hadji
just
in
time
he
checked
himself
from
firing
the
hadjis
had
holstered
their
weapons
one
of
them
was
saying
poor
old
draken
he
simply
could
not
learn
to
take
quick
aim
lack
of
practice
the
other
man
said
draken
never
spent
much
time
on
the
firing
range
well
if
you
ask
me
it
a
very
good
object
lesson
one
must
get
out
of
practice
and
the
other
man
said
one
must
underestimate
even
a
peon
he
looked
at
barrent
nice
shooting
fellow
yes
very
nice
indeed
the
other
man
said
it
difficult
to
fire
a
handgun
accurately
while
in
motion
barrent
got
to
his
feet
shakily
still
holding
the
girl
weapon
prepared
to
fire
at
the
first
suspicious
movement
from
the
hadjis
but
they
were
moving
suspiciously
they
seemed
to
regard
the
entire
incident
as
closed
what
happens
now
barrent
asked
nothing
one
of
the
hadjis
said
on
landing
day
one
kill
is
all
that
any
man
or
hunting
party
is
allowed
after
that
you
out
of
the
hunt
it
really
a
very
unimportant
holiday
the
other
man
said
not
like
the
games
or
the
lottery
all
that
remains
for
you
to
do
the
first
man
said
is
to
go
to
the
registration
office
and
collect
your
inheritance
my
your
inheritance
the
hadji
said
patiently
you
entitled
to
the
entire
estate
of
your
victim
in
draken
case
i
sorry
to
say
it
does
amount
to
very
much
he
never
was
a
good
businessman
the
other
said
sadly
still
give
you
a
little
something
to
start
life
with
and
since
you
made
an
authorized
kill
even
though
a
highly
unusual
one
you
move
upward
in
status
you
become
a
free
citizen
people
had
come
back
into
the
streets
and
shopkeepers
were
unlocking
their
steel
shutters
a
truck
marked
body
disposal
unit
drove
up
and
four
uniformed
men
took
away
draken
body
the
normal
life
of
tetrahyde
had
begun
again
this
more
than
any
assurances
from
the
hadjis
told
barrent
that
the
moment
for
murder
was
over
he
put
the
girl
weapon
in
his
pocket
the
registration
office
is
over
this
way
one
of
the
hadjis
told
him
we
act
as
your
witnesses
barrent
still
had
only
a
limited
understanding
of
the
situation
but
since
things
were
suddenly
going
his
way
he
decided
to
accept
whatever
happened
without
question
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
later
to
find
out
where
he
stood
accompanied
by
the
hadjis
he
went
to
the
registration
office
on
gunpoint
square
there
a
bored
clerk
heard
the
entire
story
produced
draken
business
papers
and
pasted
barrent
name
over
draken
barrent
noticed
that
several
other
names
had
been
pasted
over
there
seemed
to
be
a
fast
turnover
of
businesses
in
tetrahyde
he
found
that
he
was
now
the
owner
of
an
antidote
shop
at
blazer
boulevard
the
business
papers
also
officially
recognized
barrent
new
rank
as
a
free
citizen
the
clerk
gave
him
a
ring
of
status
made
of
gunmetal
and
advised
him
to
change
into
citizen
clothing
as
soon
as
possible
if
he
wished
to
avoid
unpleasant
incidents
outside
the
hadjis
wished
him
luck
barrent
decided
to
see
what
his
new
business
was
like
blazer
boulevard
was
a
short
alley
running
between
two
streets
near
the
middle
of
it
was
a
store
front
with
a
sign
which
read
antidote
shop
beneath
that
it
read
for
every
poison
whether
animal
vegetable
or
mineral
carry
our
handy
do
it
yourself
survival
kit
antidotes
in
one
container
barrent
opened
the
door
and
went
in
behind
a
low
counter
he
saw
shelves
stocked
with
labeled
bottles
cans
and
cartons
and
square
glass
jars
containing
odd
bits
of
leaves
twigs
and
fungus
in
back
of
the
counter
was
a
small
shelf
of
books
with
titles
like
diagnosis
in
acute
poisoning
arsenic
and
permutations
of
it
was
quite
obvious
that
poisoning
played
a
large
part
in
the
daily
life
of
omega
here
was
a
store
and
presumably
there
were
others
whose
sole
purpose
was
to
dispense
antidotes
barrent
thought
about
this
and
decided
that
he
had
inherited
a
strange
but
honorable
business
he
would
study
the
books
and
find
out
how
an
antidote
shop
was
run
the
store
had
a
back
apartment
with
a
living
room
bedroom
and
kitchen
in
one
of
the
closets
barrent
found
a
badly
made
suit
of
citizen
black
into
which
he
changed
he
took
the
girl
weapon
from
the
pocket
of
his
prison
ship
uniform
weighed
it
in
his
hand
for
a
moment
then
put
it
into
a
pocket
of
his
new
suit
he
left
the
store
and
found
his
way
back
to
the
victim
protective
society
the
door
was
still
open
and
the
three
ragged
men
were
still
sitting
on
the
bench
they
were
laughing
now
their
long
wait
seemed
to
have
tired
them
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
frendlyer
was
seated
behind
his
desk
reading
through
a
thick
pile
of
papers
there
was
no
sign
of
the
girl
barrent
walked
to
the
desk
and
frendlyer
stood
up
to
greet
him
my
congratulations
frendlyer
said
dear
fellow
my
very
warmest
congratulations
that
was
a
splendid
bit
of
shooting
and
in
motion
too
thank
you
barrent
said
the
reason
i
came
back
here
i
know
why
frendlyer
said
you
wished
to
be
advised
of
your
rights
and
obligations
as
a
free
citizen
what
could
be
more
natural
if
you
take
a
seat
on
that
bench
i
be
with
you
in
i
did
come
here
for
that
barrent
said
i
want
to
find
out
about
my
rights
and
obligations
of
course
but
right
now
i
want
to
find
that
girl
girl
she
was
sitting
on
the
bench
when
i
came
in
she
was
the
one
who
gave
me
the
gun
frendlyer
looked
astonished
citizen
you
must
be
laboring
under
a
misapprehension
there
has
been
no
woman
in
this
office
all
day
she
was
sitting
on
the
bench
near
those
three
men
a
very
attractive
girl
you
must
have
noticed
her
i
would
certainly
have
noticed
her
if
she
had
been
here
frendlyer
said
winking
but
as
i
said
before
no
woman
has
entered
these
premises
today
barrent
glared
at
him
and
pulled
the
gun
out
of
his
pocket
in
that
case
how
did
i
get
this
i
lent
it
to
you
frendlyer
said
i
glad
you
were
able
to
use
it
successfully
but
now
i
would
appreciate
its
return
you
lying
barrent
said
taking
a
firm
grip
on
the
weapon
ask
those
men
he
walked
over
to
the
bench
with
frendlyer
close
behind
him
he
caught
the
attention
of
the
man
who
had
been
sitting
nearest
the
girl
and
asked
him
where
did
the
girl
go
the
man
lifted
a
sullen
unshaven
face
and
said
what
girl
you
talking
about
citizen
the
one
who
was
sitting
right
here
i
did
notice
nobody
rafeel
you
see
a
female
on
this
bench
not
me
rafeel
said
and
i
been
sitting
here
continuous
since
ten
this
morning
i
did
see
her
neither
the
third
man
said
and
i
got
sharp
eyes
barrent
turned
back
to
frendlyer
why
are
you
lying
to
me
i
told
you
the
simple
truth
frendlyer
said
there
has
been
no
girl
in
here
all
day
i
lent
you
the
gun
as
is
my
privilege
as
president
of
the
victim
protective
society
i
would
now
appreciate
its
return
no
barrent
said
i
keeping
the
gun
until
i
find
the
girl
that
might
not
be
wise
frendlyer
said
he
hastily
added
thievery
i
mean
is
not
condoned
under
these
circumstances
i
take
my
chances
on
that
barrent
said
he
turned
and
left
the
victim
protective
society
chapter
five
barrent
needed
time
to
recuperate
from
his
violent
entry
into
omegan
life
starting
from
the
helpless
state
of
a
newborn
he
had
moved
through
murder
to
the
ownership
of
an
antidote
shop
from
a
forgotten
past
on
a
planet
called
earth
he
had
been
catapulted
into
a
dubious
present
in
a
world
full
of
criminals
he
had
gotten
a
glimpse
of
a
complex
class
structure
and
a
hint
of
an
institutionalized
program
of
murder
he
had
discovered
in
himself
a
certain
measure
of
and
a
surprising
quickness
with
a
gun
he
knew
there
was
a
great
deal
more
to
find
out
about
omega
earth
and
himself
he
hoped
he
would
live
long
enough
to
make
the
necessary
discoveries
first
things
first
he
had
to
earn
a
living
to
do
so
he
had
to
find
out
about
poisons
and
antidotes
he
moved
into
the
apartment
in
back
of
his
store
and
began
reading
the
books
left
by
the
late
hadji
draken
the
literature
on
poisons
was
fascinating
there
were
the
vegetable
poisons
known
on
earth
such
as
hellebore
setterwort
deadly
nightshade
and
the
yew
tree
he
learned
about
the
action
of
hemlock
its
preliminary
intoxication
and
its
final
convulsions
there
was
prussic
acid
poisoning
from
almonds
and
digitalin
poisoning
from
purple
foxglove
there
was
the
awesome
efficiency
of
wolfsbane
with
its
deadly
store
of
aconite
there
were
the
fungi
such
as
the
amanita
toadstools
and
fly
agaric
not
to
mention
the
purely
omegan
vegetable
poisons
like
redcup
flowering
lily
and
amortalis
but
the
vegetable
poisons
although
dismayingly
numerous
were
only
one
part
of
his
studies
he
had
to
consider
the
animals
of
earth
sea
and
air
the
several
species
of
deadly
spiders
the
snakes
scorpions
and
giant
wasps
there
was
an
imposing
array
of
metallic
poisons
such
as
arsenic
mercury
and
bismuth
there
were
the
commoner
corrosives
nitric
hydrochloric
phosphoric
and
sulphuric
acid
and
there
were
the
poisons
distilled
or
extracted
from
various
sources
among
which
were
strychnine
formic
acid
hyoscyamine
and
belladonna
each
of
the
poisons
had
one
or
more
antidotes
listed
but
those
complicated
cautiously
worded
formulas
barrent
suspected
were
frequently
unsuccessful
to
make
matters
more
difficult
the
efficacy
of
an
antidote
seemed
to
depend
upon
a
correct
diagnosis
of
the
poisoning
agent
and
too
often
the
symptoms
produced
by
one
poison
resembled
those
of
another
barrent
pondered
these
problems
while
he
studied
his
books
in
the
meantime
with
considerable
nervousness
he
served
his
first
customers
he
found
that
many
of
his
fears
were
ungrounded
in
spite
of
the
dozens
of
lethal
substances
recommended
by
the
poison
institute
most
poisoners
stuck
to
arsenic
or
strychnine
they
were
cheap
sure
and
very
painful
prussic
acid
had
a
readily
discernible
odor
mercury
was
difficult
to
introduce
into
the
system
and
the
corrosives
although
gratifyingly
spectacular
were
dangerous
to
the
user
wolfsbane
and
fly
agaric
were
excellent
of
course
deadly
nightshade
could
not
be
discounted
and
the
amanita
toadstool
had
its
own
macabre
charm
but
these
were
the
poisons
of
an
older
more
leisurely
age
the
impatient
younger
generation
and
especially
the
women
who
made
up
nearly
per
cent
of
the
poisoners
on
omega
were
satisfied
with
plain
arsenic
or
strychnine
as
the
occasion
and
opportunity
demanded
omegan
women
were
conservatives
they
simply
were
interested
in
the
refinements
of
the
poisoner
art
means
did
interest
them
only
ends
as
quickly
and
as
cheaply
as
possible
omegan
women
were
noted
for
their
common
sense
although
the
eager
theoreticians
at
the
poison
institute
tried
to
sell
dubious
mixtures
of
contact
poison
or
three
day
mold
and
worked
hard
to
put
across
complex
haywire
schemes
involving
wasps
concealed
needles
and
double
glasses
they
found
few
takers
among
women
simple
arsenic
and
strychnine
continued
to
be
the
mainstays
of
the
poison
trade
this
quite
naturally
simplified
barrent
work
his
remedies
immediate
regurgitation
lavage
neutralizing
agent
were
easy
enough
to
master
he
encountered
some
difficulty
with
men
who
refused
to
believe
they
had
been
poisoned
by
anything
so
commonplace
as
arsenic
or
strychnine
for
those
cases
barrent
prescribed
a
variety
of
roots
herbs
twigs
leaves
and
a
minute
homeopathic
dose
of
poison
but
he
invariably
preceded
these
with
regurgitation
lavage
and
neutralizing
agent
after
he
was
settled
barrent
received
a
visit
from
danis
foeren
and
joe
foeren
had
a
temporary
job
on
the
docks
unloading
fishing
boats
joe
had
organized
a
nightly
pokra
game
among
the
government
workers
of
tetrahyde
neither
man
had
moved
much
in
status
with
no
kills
to
their
credit
they
had
progressed
only
as
far
as
second
class
resident
they
were
nervous
about
meeting
socially
with
a
free
citizen
but
barrent
put
them
at
ease
they
were
the
only
friends
he
had
on
omega
and
he
had
no
intention
of
losing
them
over
a
question
of
social
position
barrent
was
unable
to
learn
very
much
from
them
about
the
laws
and
customs
of
tetrahyde
even
joe
had
been
able
to
find
out
anything
definite
from
his
friends
in
government
service
on
omega
the
law
was
kept
secret
older
residents
used
their
knowledge
of
the
law
to
enforce
their
rule
over
the
newcomers
this
system
was
condoned
and
reinforced
by
the
doctrine
of
the
inequality
of
all
men
which
lay
at
the
heart
of
the
omegan
legal
system
through
planned
inequality
and
enforced
ignorance
power
and
status
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
older
residents
of
course
all
social
movement
upward
could
be
stopped
but
it
could
be
retarded
discouraged
and
made
exceedingly
dangerous
the
way
one
encountered
the
laws
and
customs
of
omega
was
through
a
risky
process
of
trial
and
error
although
the
antidote
shop
took
up
most
of
his
time
barrent
persisted
in
his
efforts
to
locate
the
girl
he
was
unable
to
find
a
hint
that
she
even
existed
he
became
friendly
with
the
shopkeepers
on
either
side
of
him
one
of
them
demond
harrisbourg
was
a
jaunty
moustached
young
man
who
operated
a
food
store
it
was
a
mundane
and
slightly
ridiculous
line
of
work
but
as
harrisbourg
explained
even
criminals
must
eat
and
this
necessitated
farmers
processors
packagers
and
food
stores
harrisbourg
contended
that
his
business
was
in
no
way
inferior
to
the
more
indigenous
omegan
industries
centered
around
violent
death
besides
harrisbourg
wife
uncle
was
a
minister
of
public
works
through
him
harrisbourg
expected
to
receive
a
murder
certificate
with
this
document
he
could
make
his
kill
and
move
upward
to
the
status
of
privileged
citizen
barrent
nodded
his
agreement
but
he
wondered
if
harrisbourg
wife
a
thin
restless
woman
would
decide
to
poison
him
first
she
appeared
to
be
dissatisfied
with
her
husband
and
divorce
was
forbidden
on
omega
his
other
neighbor
tem
rend
was
a
lanky
cheerful
man
in
his
early
forties
he
had
a
heat
scar
which
ran
from
just
beneath
his
left
ear
down
almost
to
the
corner
of
his
mouth
a
souvenir
given
him
by
a
hopeful
the
hopeful
had
picked
on
the
wrong
man
tem
rend
owned
a
weapon
shop
practiced
constantly
and
always
carried
the
articles
of
his
trade
with
him
according
to
witnesses
he
had
performed
the
counterkill
in
exemplary
fashion
tem
dream
was
to
become
a
member
of
the
assassin
guild
his
application
was
on
file
with
that
ancient
and
austere
organization
and
he
had
a
chance
of
being
accepted
within
the
month
barrent
bought
a
sidearm
from
him
on
rend
advice
he
chose
a
needlebeam
it
was
faster
and
more
accurate
than
any
projectile
weapon
and
it
transmitted
the
same
as
a
heavy
caliber
bullet
to
be
sure
it
had
the
spread
of
heat
weapons
such
as
the
hadjis
used
which
could
kill
within
six
inches
of
their
target
but
beamers
encouraged
inaccuracy
they
were
messy
careless
weapons
which
reinforced
careless
traits
anyone
could
fire
a
heat
gun
but
to
use
a
needlebeam
effectively
you
had
to
practice
constantly
and
practice
paid
off
a
good
needlebeam
man
was
more
than
a
match
for
any
two
widebeam
gunmen
barrent
took
this
advice
to
heart
coming
as
it
did
from
an
apprentice
assassin
and
the
owner
of
a
weapon
shop
he
put
in
long
hours
on
cellar
firing
range
sharpening
his
reflexes
getting
used
to
the
holster
there
was
a
lot
to
do
and
a
tremendous
amount
to
learn
just
in
order
to
survive
barrent
did
mind
hard
work
as
long
as
it
was
for
a
worthwhile
goal
he
hoped
things
would
stay
quiet
for
a
while
so
he
could
catch
up
to
the
older
inhabitants
but
things
never
stayed
quiet
in
omega
one
day
late
in
the
afternoon
as
he
was
closing
up
barrent
received
an
caller
he
was
a
man
in
his
fifties
with
a
stern
swarthy
face
he
wore
a
red
robe
and
sandals
around
his
waist
was
a
rawhide
belt
from
which
dangled
a
small
black
book
and
a
dagger
there
was
an
air
of
unusual
force
and
authority
about
him
barrent
was
unable
to
tell
his
status
barrent
said
i
was
just
closing
up
sir
but
if
there
anything
you
wish
to
buy
i
did
not
come
here
to
buy
the
caller
said
he
permitted
himself
a
faint
smile
i
came
here
to
sell
sell
i
am
a
priest
the
man
said
you
are
a
newcomer
to
my
district
i
have
noticed
you
at
services
i
had
known
anything
about
the
priest
held
up
his
hand
under
both
the
sacred
and
the
profane
law
ignorance
is
no
excuse
for
nonperformance
of
one
duties
indeed
ignorance
can
be
punished
as
an
act
of
willful
neglect
based
upon
the
total
personal
responsibility
act
of
to
say
nothing
of
the
lesser
codicil
he
smiled
again
however
there
is
no
question
of
chastisement
for
you
as
yet
i
glad
to
hear
that
sir
barrent
said
is
the
proper
form
of
address
the
priest
said
i
am
uncle
ingemar
and
i
have
come
to
tell
you
about
the
orthodox
religion
of
omega
which
is
the
worship
of
that
pure
and
transcendent
spirit
of
evil
which
is
our
inspiration
and
our
comfort
barrent
said
i
be
very
happy
to
hear
about
the
religion
of
evil
uncle
shall
we
go
into
the
living
room
by
all
means
nephew
the
priest
said
and
followed
barrent
to
the
apartment
in
back
of
the
store
chapter
six
evil
the
priest
said
after
he
had
settled
comfortably
into
best
chair
is
that
force
within
us
which
inspires
men
to
acts
of
strength
and
endurance
the
worship
of
evil
is
essentially
the
worship
of
oneself
and
therefore
the
only
true
worship
the
self
which
one
worships
is
the
ideal
social
being
the
man
content
in
his
niche
in
society
yet
ready
to
grasp
any
opportunity
for
advancement
the
man
who
meets
death
with
dignity
who
kills
without
the
demeaning
vice
of
pity
evil
is
cruel
since
it
is
a
true
reflection
of
the
uncaring
and
insensate
universe
evil
is
eternal
and
unchanging
although
it
comes
to
us
in
the
many
forms
of
protean
life
would
you
care
for
a
little
wine
uncle
barrent
asked
thank
you
that
very
thoughtful
uncle
ingemar
said
how
is
business
fair
a
little
slow
this
week
people
do
take
the
same
interest
in
poisoning
the
priest
said
moodily
sipping
his
drink
not
like
when
i
was
a
boy
newly
unfrocked
and
shipped
out
from
earth
however
i
was
speaking
to
you
about
evil
yes
uncle
we
worship
evil
uncle
ingemar
said
in
the
incarnate
form
of
the
black
one
that
horned
and
horrid
specter
of
our
days
and
nights
in
the
black
one
we
find
the
seven
cardinal
sins
the
forty
felonies
and
the
hundred
and
one
misdemeanors
there
is
no
crime
that
the
black
one
has
not
performed
faultlessly
as
befits
his
nature
therefore
we
imperfect
beings
model
ourselves
upon
his
perfections
and
sometimes
the
black
one
rewards
us
by
appearing
before
us
in
the
awful
beauty
of
his
fiery
flesh
yes
nephew
i
have
actually
been
privileged
to
see
him
two
years
ago
he
appeared
at
the
conclusion
of
the
games
and
he
also
appeared
the
year
before
that
the
priest
brooded
for
a
moment
over
the
divine
appearance
then
he
said
since
we
recognize
in
the
state
man
highest
potential
for
evil
we
also
worship
the
state
as
a
suprahuman
though
less
than
divine
creation
barrent
nodded
he
was
having
a
difficult
time
staying
awake
uncle
ingemar
low
monotonous
voice
lecturing
about
so
commonplace
a
thing
as
evil
had
a
soporific
effect
on
him
he
struggled
to
keep
his
eyes
open
one
might
well
ask
uncle
ingemar
droned
on
if
evil
is
the
highest
attainment
of
the
nature
of
man
why
then
did
the
black
one
allow
any
good
to
exist
in
the
universe
the
problem
of
good
has
bothered
the
unenlightened
for
ages
i
will
now
answer
it
for
you
yes
uncle
barrent
said
surreptitiously
pinching
himself
on
the
inside
of
the
thigh
in
an
effort
to
stay
awake
but
first
uncle
ingemar
said
let
us
define
our
terms
let
us
examine
the
nature
of
good
let
us
boldly
and
fearlessly
stare
our
great
opponent
in
the
face
and
discover
the
true
lineaments
of
his
features
yes
barrent
said
wondering
if
he
should
open
a
window
his
eyes
felt
incredibly
heavy
he
rubbed
them
hard
and
tried
to
pay
attention
good
is
a
state
of
illusion
said
uncle
ingemar
in
his
even
monotonous
voice
which
ascribes
to
man
the
nonexistent
attributes
of
altruism
humility
and
piety
how
can
we
recognize
good
as
being
an
illusion
because
there
is
only
man
and
the
black
one
in
the
universe
and
to
worship
the
black
one
is
to
worship
the
ultimate
expression
of
oneself
thus
since
we
have
proven
good
to
be
an
illusion
we
necessarily
recognize
its
attributes
as
nonexistent
understood
barrent
did
answer
do
you
understand
the
priest
asked
more
sharply
eh
barrent
said
he
had
been
dozing
with
his
eyes
open
he
forced
himself
awake
and
managed
to
say
yes
uncle
i
understand
excellent
understanding
that
we
ask
why
did
the
black
one
allow
even
the
illusion
of
good
to
exist
in
an
evil
universe
and
the
answer
is
found
in
the
law
of
necessary
opposites
for
evil
could
not
be
recognized
as
such
without
something
to
contrast
it
with
the
best
contrast
is
an
opposite
and
the
opposite
of
evil
is
good
the
priest
smiled
triumphantly
it
so
simple
and
is
it
it
certainly
is
uncle
barrent
said
would
you
like
a
little
more
wine
just
the
tiniest
drop
the
priest
said
he
talked
to
barrent
for
another
ten
minutes
about
the
natural
and
charming
evil
inherent
in
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
forest
and
counseled
barrent
to
pattern
his
behavior
on
those
creatures
at
last
he
rose
to
leave
i
very
glad
we
could
have
this
little
chat
the
priest
said
warmly
shaking
barrent
hand
can
i
count
on
your
appearance
at
our
monday
night
services
services
of
course
uncle
ingemar
said
every
monday
night
at
midnight
we
hold
black
mass
at
the
wee
coven
on
kirkwood
drive
after
services
the
ladies
auxiliary
usually
puts
out
a
snack
and
we
have
community
dancing
and
choir
singing
it
all
very
jolly
he
smiled
broadly
you
see
the
worship
of
evil
be
fun
i
sure
it
can
barrent
said
i
be
there
uncle
he
showed
the
priest
to
the
door
after
locking
up
he
thought
carefully
about
what
uncle
ingemar
had
said
no
doubt
about
it
attendance
at
services
was
necessary
compulsory
in
fact
he
just
hoped
that
the
black
mass
would
be
as
infernally
dull
as
ingemar
exposition
of
evil
that
was
friday
barrent
was
kept
busy
over
the
next
two
days
he
received
a
shipment
of
homeopathic
herbs
and
roots
from
his
agent
in
the
bloodpit
district
it
took
the
better
part
of
a
day
to
sort
and
classify
them
and
another
day
to
store
them
in
the
proper
jars
on
monday
returning
to
his
shop
after
lunch
barrent
thought
he
saw
the
girl
he
hurried
after
her
but
lost
her
in
the
crowd
when
he
got
back
to
his
store
barrent
found
that
a
letter
had
been
slipped
under
his
door
it
was
an
invitation
from
his
neighborhood
dream
shop
the
letter
read
dear
citizen
we
take
this
opportunity
of
welcoming
you
into
the
neighborhood
and
extending
to
you
the
services
of
what
we
believe
to
be
the
finest
dream
on
omega
all
manner
and
type
of
dreams
are
available
to
you
and
at
a
surprisingly
low
cost
we
specialize
in
dreams
of
earth
you
can
be
assured
that
your
neighborhood
dream
shop
offers
you
only
the
finest
in
vicarious
living
as
a
free
citizen
you
will
surely
wish
to
avail
yourself
of
these
services
may
we
hope
that
you
do
so
within
the
week
the
proprietors
barrent
put
down
the
letter
he
had
no
idea
what
a
dream
shop
was
or
how
the
dreams
were
produced
he
would
have
to
find
out
even
though
the
invitation
was
graciously
worded
it
had
a
peremptory
tone
to
it
past
a
doubt
a
visit
to
a
dream
shop
was
one
of
the
obligations
of
a
free
citizen
but
of
course
an
obligation
could
be
a
pleasure
too
the
dream
shop
sounded
interesting
and
a
genuine
dream
of
earth
would
be
worth
almost
any
price
the
proprietors
wished
to
ask
but
that
would
have
to
wait
tonight
was
black
mass
and
his
attendance
there
was
definitely
required
barrent
left
his
store
at
eleven
in
the
evening
he
wanted
time
for
a
stroll
around
tetrahyde
before
going
to
the
service
which
began
at
midnight
he
started
his
walk
with
a
definite
sense
of
and
yet
because
of
the
irrational
and
unexpecting
nature
of
omega
he
almost
died
before
reaching
the
wee
coven
on
kirkwood
drive
chapter
seven
it
had
turned
into
a
hot
almost
suffocatingly
humid
night
when
barrent
began
his
walk
not
the
faintest
breath
of
air
stirred
along
the
darkened
streets
although
he
was
wearing
only
a
black
mesh
shirt
shorts
gunbelt
and
sandals
barrent
felt
as
if
he
were
wrapped
in
a
thick
blanket
most
of
the
people
of
tetrahyde
except
for
those
already
at
the
covens
had
retired
to
the
coolness
of
their
cellars
the
dark
streets
were
nearly
deserted
barrent
walked
on
more
slowly
the
few
people
he
met
were
running
to
their
homes
there
was
a
sense
of
panic
in
that
silent
dogged
sprint
through
heat
which
made
walking
difficult
barrent
tried
to
find
out
what
the
matter
was
but
no
one
would
stop
one
old
man
shouted
over
his
shoulder
get
off
the
street
idiot
why
barrent
asked
him
the
old
man
snarled
something
unintelligible
and
hurried
on
barrent
kept
on
walking
nervously
fingering
the
butt
of
his
needlebeam
something
was
certainly
wrong
but
he
had
no
idea
what
it
was
his
nearest
shelter
now
was
the
wee
coven
about
half
a
mile
away
it
seemed
best
to
keep
on
moving
in
that
direction
staying
alert
waiting
to
see
what
was
wrong
in
a
few
minutes
barrent
was
alone
in
a
tightly
shuttered
city
he
moved
into
the
center
of
the
street
loosened
the
needlebeam
in
its
holster
and
prepared
for
attack
from
any
side
perhaps
this
was
some
special
holiday
like
landing
day
perhaps
free
citizens
were
fair
game
tonight
anything
seemed
possible
on
a
planet
like
omega
he
thought
he
was
ready
for
any
possibility
but
when
the
attack
came
it
was
from
an
unexpected
quarter
a
faint
breeze
stirred
the
stagnant
air
it
faded
and
returned
stronger
this
time
perceptibly
cooling
the
hot
streets
wind
rolled
off
the
mountains
of
the
interior
and
swept
through
the
streets
of
tetrahyde
and
barrent
could
feel
the
perspiration
on
his
chest
and
back
begin
to
dry
for
a
few
minutes
the
climate
of
tetrahyde
was
as
pleasant
as
anything
he
could
imagine
then
the
temperature
continued
to
fall
it
dropped
rapidly
frigid
air
swept
in
from
the
distant
mountain
slopes
and
the
temperature
fell
through
the
seventies
into
the
sixties
this
is
ridiculous
barrent
thought
to
himself
i
better
get
to
the
coven
he
walked
more
rapidly
while
the
temperature
plummeted
it
passed
through
the
forties
into
the
low
thirties
the
first
glittering
signs
of
frost
appeared
on
the
streets
it
ca
go
much
lower
barrent
thought
but
it
could
an
angry
winter
wind
blew
through
the
streets
and
the
temperature
dropped
into
the
twenties
moisture
in
the
air
began
forming
into
sleet
chilled
to
the
bone
barrent
ran
down
the
empty
streets
and
the
wind
rising
to
gale
force
pulled
and
tugged
at
him
the
streets
glittered
with
ice
making
the
footing
dangerous
he
skidded
and
fell
and
had
to
run
at
a
slower
pace
to
keep
his
footing
and
still
the
temperature
dropped
and
the
wind
growled
and
snapped
like
an
angry
beast
he
saw
light
through
a
heavily
shuttered
window
he
stopped
and
pounded
at
the
shutters
but
no
sound
came
from
inside
he
realized
that
the
people
of
tetrahyde
never
helped
anyone
the
more
who
died
the
more
chance
there
was
for
the
survivors
so
barrent
continued
running
on
feet
that
felt
like
chunks
of
wood
the
wind
shrieked
in
his
ear
and
hailstones
the
size
of
his
fist
pelted
the
ground
he
was
getting
too
tired
to
run
all
he
could
do
now
was
walk
through
a
frozen
white
world
and
hope
he
would
reach
the
wee
coven
he
walked
for
hours
or
for
years
at
one
corner
he
passed
the
bodies
of
two
men
huddled
against
a
wall
and
covered
with
frost
they
had
stopped
running
and
had
frozen
to
death
barrent
forced
himself
to
run
again
a
stitch
in
his
side
felt
like
a
knife
wound
and
the
cold
was
creeping
up
his
arms
and
down
his
legs
soon
the
cold
would
reach
his
chest
and
that
would
be
the
end
a
flurry
of
hailstones
stunned
him
without
conscious
transition
he
found
that
he
was
lying
on
the
icy
ground
and
a
monstrous
wind
was
whirling
away
the
tiny
warmth
his
body
was
able
to
generate
at
the
far
end
of
the
block
he
could
see
the
tiny
red
light
of
the
coven
he
crept
toward
it
on
hands
and
knees
moving
mechanically
not
really
expecting
to
get
there
he
crawled
forever
and
the
beckoning
red
light
always
remained
the
same
distance
from
him
but
he
kept
on
crawling
and
at
last
he
reached
the
door
of
the
coven
he
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
and
turned
the
doorknob
the
door
was
locked
he
pounded
feebly
on
the
door
after
a
moment
a
panel
slid
back
he
saw
a
man
staring
at
him
then
the
panel
slid
shut
he
waited
for
the
door
to
open
it
did
open
minutes
passed
and
still
it
did
open
what
were
they
waiting
for
inside
what
was
wrong
barrent
tried
to
pound
on
the
door
again
lost
his
balance
and
fell
to
the
ground
he
rolled
over
and
looked
despairingly
at
the
locked
door
then
he
lost
consciousness
when
he
came
to
barrent
found
himself
lying
on
a
couch
two
men
were
massaging
his
arms
and
legs
and
beneath
him
he
could
feel
the
warmth
of
heating
pads
peering
anxiously
at
him
was
the
broad
swarthy
face
of
uncle
ingemar
feeling
better
now
uncle
ingemar
asked
i
think
so
barrent
said
why
did
you
take
so
long
opening
the
door
we
almost
did
open
it
at
all
the
priest
told
him
it
against
the
law
to
aid
strangers
in
distress
since
you
had
as
yet
joined
the
coven
you
were
technically
still
a
stranger
then
why
did
you
let
me
in
my
assistant
noticed
that
we
had
an
even
number
of
worshipers
we
require
an
odd
number
preferably
ending
in
three
where
the
sacred
and
the
profane
laws
are
in
conflict
the
profane
must
yield
so
we
let
you
in
despite
the
government
ruling
it
a
ridiculous
ruling
barrent
said
not
really
like
most
of
the
laws
of
omega
it
is
designed
to
keep
the
population
down
omega
is
an
extremely
barren
planet
you
know
the
constant
arrival
of
new
prisoners
keeps
swelling
the
population
to
the
enormous
disadvantage
of
the
older
inhabitants
ways
and
means
must
be
sought
to
dispose
of
the
excess
newcomers
it
is
fair
barrent
said
you
change
your
mind
when
you
become
an
older
inhabitant
ingemar
said
and
by
your
tenacity
i
sure
you
become
one
maybe
barrent
said
but
what
happened
the
temperature
must
have
dropped
nearly
a
hundred
degrees
in
fifteen
minutes
a
hundred
and
eight
degrees
to
be
exact
uncle
ingemar
said
really
very
simple
omega
is
a
planet
which
revolves
eccentrically
around
a
double
star
system
further
instability
i
told
comes
from
the
planet
peculiar
physical
the
placement
of
mountains
and
seas
the
result
is
a
uniformly
and
dramatically
bad
climate
characterized
by
sudden
violent
temperature
changes
the
assistant
a
small
fellow
said
it
has
been
calculated
that
omega
is
at
the
outer
limits
of
the
planets
which
can
support
human
life
without
gross
artificial
aids
if
the
fluctuations
between
hot
and
cold
were
any
more
violent
all
human
life
here
would
be
wiped
out
it
the
perfect
punitive
world
uncle
ingemar
said
proudly
experienced
residents
sense
when
a
temperature
change
is
about
to
take
place
and
get
indoors
it
hellish
barrent
said
at
a
loss
for
words
that
describes
it
perfectly
the
priest
said
it
hellish
and
therefore
perfect
for
the
worship
of
the
black
one
if
you
feeling
better
now
citizen
barrent
shall
we
proceed
with
services
except
for
a
touch
of
frostbite
on
his
toes
and
fingers
barrent
was
all
right
he
nodded
and
followed
the
priest
and
the
worshipers
into
the
main
part
of
the
coven
after
what
he
had
been
through
the
black
mass
was
necessarily
an
anticlimax
in
his
warmly
heated
pew
barrent
drowsed
through
uncle
ingemar
sermon
on
the
necessary
performance
of
everyday
evil
the
worship
of
evil
uncle
ingemar
said
should
not
be
reserved
solely
for
monday
nights
on
the
contrary
the
knowledge
and
performance
of
evil
should
suffuse
one
daily
life
it
was
not
given
to
everyone
to
be
a
great
sinner
but
no
one
should
be
discouraged
by
that
little
acts
of
badness
performed
over
a
lifetime
accumulated
into
a
sinful
whole
most
pleasing
to
the
black
one
no
one
should
forget
that
some
of
the
greatest
sinners
even
the
demoniac
saints
themselves
often
had
humble
beginnings
did
not
thrastus
start
as
a
humble
shopkeeper
cheating
his
customers
of
a
portion
of
rice
who
would
have
expected
that
simple
man
to
develop
into
the
red
slayer
of
thorndyke
lane
and
who
could
have
imagined
that
louen
son
of
a
dockhand
would
one
day
become
the
world
foremost
authority
on
the
practical
applications
of
torture
perseverance
and
piety
had
allowed
those
men
to
rise
above
their
natural
handicaps
to
a
position
at
the
right
hand
of
the
black
one
and
it
proved
uncle
ingemar
said
that
evil
was
the
business
of
the
poor
as
well
as
the
rich
that
ended
the
sermon
barrent
awoke
momentarily
when
the
sacred
symbols
were
brought
out
and
displayed
to
the
reverent
congregation
a
dagger
and
a
plaster
toad
then
he
dozed
again
through
the
slow
inscribing
of
the
magical
pentagon
at
last
the
ceremony
neared
its
end
the
names
of
the
interceding
evil
demons
were
read
bael
forcas
buer
marchocias
astaroth
and
behemoth
a
prayer
was
read
to
ward
off
the
effects
of
good
and
uncle
ingemar
apologized
for
not
having
a
virgin
to
sacrifice
on
the
red
altar
our
funds
were
not
sufficient
he
said
for
the
purchase
of
a
peon
virgin
however
i
am
sure
we
will
be
able
to
perform
the
full
ceremony
next
monday
my
assistant
will
now
pass
among
you
the
assistant
carried
around
the
collection
plate
like
the
other
worshipers
barrent
contributed
generously
it
seemed
wise
to
do
so
uncle
ingemar
was
clearly
annoyed
at
not
having
a
virgin
to
sacrifice
if
he
became
a
little
angrier
he
might
take
it
into
his
head
to
sacrifice
one
of
the
congregation
virgin
or
not
barrent
did
stay
for
the
choir
singing
or
the
community
dancing
when
the
evening
worship
was
finished
he
poked
his
head
cautiously
out
the
door
the
temperature
had
gone
up
to
the
seventies
and
the
frost
was
already
melted
from
the
ground
barrent
shook
hands
with
the
priest
and
hurried
home
chapter
eight
barrent
had
had
enough
of
omega
shocks
and
surprises
he
stayed
close
to
his
store
worked
at
his
business
and
kept
alert
for
trouble
he
was
beginning
to
develop
the
omegan
look
a
narrow
suspicious
squint
a
hand
always
near
gun
butt
feet
ready
to
sprint
like
the
older
inhabitants
he
was
acquiring
a
sixth
sense
for
danger
at
night
after
the
doors
and
windows
were
barred
and
the
triplex
alarm
system
had
been
set
barrent
would
lie
on
his
bed
and
try
to
remember
earth
probing
into
the
misty
recesses
of
his
memory
he
found
tantalizing
hints
and
traces
and
fragments
of
pictures
here
was
a
great
highway
curving
toward
the
sun
a
fragment
of
a
huge
city
a
closeup
view
of
a
starship
curving
hull
but
the
pictures
were
not
continuous
they
existed
for
the
barest
fraction
of
a
second
then
vanished
on
saturday
barrent
spent
the
evening
with
joe
danis
foeren
and
his
neighbor
tem
rend
joe
pokra
had
prospered
and
he
had
been
able
to
bribe
his
way
to
the
status
of
free
citizen
foeren
was
too
blunt
and
straightforward
for
that
he
had
remained
at
the
residency
level
but
tem
rend
promised
to
take
the
big
forger
as
an
assistant
if
the
assassin
guild
accepted
his
application
the
evening
started
pleasantly
enough
but
it
ended
as
usual
with
an
argument
about
earth
now
look
joe
said
we
all
know
what
earth
is
like
it
a
complex
of
gigantic
floating
cities
they
built
on
artificial
islands
in
the
various
oceans
no
the
cities
are
on
land
barrent
said
on
water
joe
said
the
people
of
earth
have
returned
to
the
sea
everyone
has
special
oxygen
adaptors
for
breathing
salt
water
the
land
areas
are
even
used
any
more
the
sea
provides
everything
that
it
is
like
that
barrent
said
i
remember
huge
cities
but
they
were
all
on
land
foeren
said
you
both
wrong
what
would
earth
want
with
cities
she
gave
them
up
centuries
ago
earth
is
a
landscaped
park
now
everyone
has
his
own
home
and
several
acres
of
land
all
the
forests
and
jungles
have
been
allowed
to
grow
back
people
live
nature
instead
of
trying
to
conquer
it
is
that
right
tem
almost
but
not
quite
tem
rend
said
there
are
still
cities
but
they
underground
tremendous
underground
factories
and
production
areas
the
rest
is
like
foeren
said
there
are
any
more
factories
foeren
insisted
stubbornly
no
need
of
them
any
goods
which
a
man
requires
can
be
produced
by
i
telling
you
joe
said
i
can
remember
the
floating
cities
i
used
to
live
in
the
nimui
sector
on
the
island
of
pasiphae
you
think
that
proves
anything
rend
asked
i
remember
that
i
worked
on
the
eighteenth
underground
level
of
nueva
chicaga
my
work
quota
was
twenty
days
a
year
the
rest
of
the
time
i
spent
outdoors
in
the
forests
foeren
said
that
wrong
tem
there
are
any
underground
levels
i
can
remember
distinctly
that
my
father
was
a
controller
third
class
our
family
used
to
trek
several
hundred
miles
every
year
when
we
needed
something
my
father
would
it
and
there
it
be
he
promised
to
teach
me
how
but
i
guess
he
never
did
barrent
said
well
a
couple
of
us
are
certainly
having
false
recall
that
certain
joe
said
but
the
question
is
which
of
us
is
right
we
never
find
out
rend
said
unless
we
can
return
to
earth
that
ended
the
discussion
toward
the
end
of
the
week
barrent
received
another
invitation
from
the
dream
shop
more
strongly
worded
than
the
first
he
decided
to
discharge
the
obligation
that
evening
he
checked
the
temperature
and
found
that
it
had
risen
into
the
high
nineties
wiser
now
in
omegan
ways
he
packed
a
small
satchel
full
of
clothing
and
started
out
the
dream
shop
was
located
in
the
exclusive
death
row
section
barrent
went
in
and
found
himself
in
a
small
sumptuously
furnished
waiting
room
a
sleek
young
man
behind
a
polished
desk
gave
him
an
artificial
smile
could
i
be
of
service
the
young
man
asked
my
name
is
nomis
arkdragen
assistant
manager
in
charge
of
nightside
dreams
i
like
to
know
something
about
what
happens
barrent
said
how
one
gets
dreams
what
kind
of
dreams
all
that
sort
of
thing
of
course
arkdragen
said
our
service
is
easily
explained
citizen
barrent
will
barrent
arkdragen
nodded
and
checked
a
name
from
a
list
in
front
of
him
he
looked
up
and
said
our
dreams
are
produced
by
the
action
of
drugs
upon
the
brain
and
the
central
nervous
system
there
are
many
drugs
which
produce
the
desired
effect
among
the
most
useful
are
heroin
morphine
opium
coca
hemp
and
peyote
all
those
are
earth
products
found
only
on
omega
are
black
slipper
nace
manicee
djedalas
and
the
various
products
of
the
carmoid
group
any
and
all
of
these
are
i
see
barrent
said
then
you
sell
drugs
not
at
all
arkdragen
said
nothing
so
simple
nothing
so
crude
in
ancient
times
on
earth
men
administered
drugs
to
themselves
the
dreams
which
resulted
were
necessarily
random
in
nature
you
never
knew
what
you
would
dream
about
or
for
how
long
you
never
knew
if
you
would
have
a
dream
or
a
nightmare
a
horror
or
a
delight
this
uncertainty
has
been
removed
from
the
modern
dream
shop
nowadays
our
drugs
are
carefully
measured
mixed
and
metered
for
each
individual
there
is
an
absolute
precision
in
ranging
from
the
calm
of
black
slipper
through
the
multicolored
hallucinations
of
peyotl
and
to
the
sexual
fantasies
induced
by
nace
and
morphine
and
at
last
to
the
dreams
of
the
carmoid
group
it
the
dreams
i
interested
in
barrent
said
arkdragen
frowned
i
would
recommend
it
for
a
first
visit
why
not
dreams
of
earth
are
apt
to
be
more
unsettling
than
any
imaginary
productions
it
usually
advisable
to
build
up
a
tolerance
for
them
i
would
advise
a
nice
little
sexual
fantasy
for
your
first
visit
we
have
a
special
sale
on
sexual
fantasies
this
week
barrent
shook
his
head
i
think
i
prefer
the
real
thing
you
would
the
assistant
manager
said
with
a
knowing
smile
believe
me
once
one
becomes
accustomed
to
vicarious
sex
experiences
the
real
thing
is
pallid
by
comparison
not
interested
barrent
said
what
i
want
is
a
dream
about
earth
but
you
have
built
up
a
tolerance
arkdragen
said
you
are
even
addicted
is
addiction
necessary
it
important
arkdragen
told
him
as
well
as
being
inescapable
all
our
drugs
are
as
the
law
requires
you
see
to
really
appreciate
a
drug
you
must
build
up
a
need
for
it
it
heightens
pleasure
enormously
to
say
nothing
of
the
increase
in
toleration
that
why
i
suggest
that
you
begin
with
i
want
a
dream
about
earth
barrent
said
very
well
arkdragen
said
grudgingly
but
we
will
not
be
responsible
for
any
traumas
which
accrue
he
led
barrent
into
a
long
passageway
it
was
lined
with
doors
and
behind
some
of
them
barrent
could
hear
dull
moans
and
gasps
of
pleasure
experiencers
arkdragen
said
without
further
explanation
he
took
barrent
to
an
open
room
near
the
end
of
the
corridor
within
sat
a
bearded
man
in
a
white
coat
reading
a
book
good
evening
doctor
wayn
arkdragen
said
this
is
citizen
barrent
first
visit
he
insists
upon
an
earth
dream
arkdragen
turned
and
left
well
the
doctor
said
i
guess
we
can
manage
that
he
put
down
his
book
just
lie
down
over
there
citizen
barrent
in
the
center
of
the
room
was
a
long
adjustable
table
above
it
hung
a
instrument
at
the
end
of
the
room
were
cabinets
filled
with
square
jars
they
reminded
barrent
of
his
antidotes
he
lay
down
doctor
wayn
put
him
through
a
general
examination
then
a
specific
check
for
suggestibility
hypnotic
index
reactions
to
the
eleven
basic
drug
groups
and
susceptibility
to
tetanic
and
epileptic
seizures
he
jotted
down
his
results
on
a
pad
checked
his
figures
went
to
a
cabinet
and
began
mixing
drugs
is
this
likely
to
be
dangerous
barrent
asked
it
should
be
doctor
wayn
said
you
appear
healthy
enough
quite
healthy
in
fact
and
with
a
low
suggestibility
rating
of
course
epileptic
fits
occur
probably
because
of
cumulative
allergic
reactions
ca
help
that
sort
of
thing
and
then
there
are
the
traumas
which
sometimes
result
in
insanity
and
death
they
form
an
interesting
study
in
themselves
and
some
people
get
stuck
in
their
dreams
and
are
unable
to
be
extricated
i
suppose
that
could
be
classified
as
a
form
of
insanity
although
actually
it
is
the
doctor
had
finished
mixing
his
drugs
he
was
loading
a
hypodermic
with
the
mixture
barrent
was
having
serious
doubts
about
the
advisability
of
the
whole
thing
perhaps
i
should
postpone
this
visit
he
said
i
not
sure
that
i
do
worry
about
a
thing
the
doctor
said
this
is
the
finest
dream
shop
on
omega
try
to
relax
tight
muscles
can
result
in
tetanic
convulsions
i
think
arkdragen
was
right
barrent
said
maybe
i
should
have
a
dream
about
earth
for
my
first
visit
he
said
it
was
dangerous
well
after
all
the
doctor
said
what
life
without
a
little
risk
besides
the
most
common
damage
is
brain
lesions
and
burst
blood
vessels
and
we
have
full
facilities
for
taking
care
of
that
sort
of
thing
he
poised
the
hypodermic
over
barrent
left
arm
i
changed
my
mind
barrent
said
and
started
to
get
off
the
bed
doctor
wayn
deftly
slid
the
needle
into
barrent
arm
one
does
not
change
one
mind
he
told
barrent
inside
a
dream
shop
try
to
relax
barrent
relaxed
he
lay
back
on
the
bed
and
heard
a
shrill
singing
in
his
ears
he
tried
to
focus
on
the
doctor
face
but
the
face
had
changed
the
face
was
old
round
and
fleshy
ridges
of
fat
stood
out
on
the
chin
and
neck
the
face
was
perspiring
friendly
worried
it
was
barrent
term
advisor
now
will
the
advisor
said
you
must
be
careful
you
must
learn
to
restrain
that
temper
of
yours
will
you
i
know
sir
barrent
said
it
just
that
i
get
so
mad
at
that
will
all
right
barrent
said
i
watch
myself
he
left
the
university
office
and
walked
into
the
city
it
was
a
fantastic
city
of
skyscrapers
and
streets
a
brilliant
city
of
silver
and
diamond
hues
an
ambitious
city
which
administered
a
network
of
countries
and
planets
barrent
walked
along
the
third
pedestrian
level
still
angry
thinking
about
andrew
therkaler
because
of
therkaler
and
his
ridiculous
jealousy
barrent
application
for
the
space
exploration
corps
had
been
turned
down
there
was
nothing
his
advisor
could
do
about
the
matter
therkaler
had
too
much
influence
on
the
selection
board
it
would
be
a
full
three
years
before
barrent
could
apply
again
in
the
meantime
he
was
and
unemployable
all
his
studies
had
been
for
extraterrestrial
exploration
there
was
no
place
for
him
on
earth
and
now
he
was
barred
from
space
therkaler
barrent
left
the
pedestrian
level
and
took
the
highspeed
ramp
into
the
sante
district
as
the
ramp
moved
he
fingered
the
small
weapon
in
his
pocket
handguns
were
illegal
on
earth
he
had
procured
his
through
untraceable
means
he
was
determined
to
kill
therkaler
there
was
a
wash
of
grotesque
faces
the
dream
blurred
when
it
cleared
barrent
found
himself
aiming
his
handgun
at
a
thin
fellow
whose
scream
for
mercy
was
abruptly
cut
short
the
informer
and
stern
noted
the
crime
and
informed
the
police
the
police
in
uniforms
of
gray
took
him
into
custody
and
brought
him
before
the
judge
the
judge
with
his
vague
parchment
face
sentenced
him
to
perpetual
servitude
upon
the
planet
omega
and
handed
down
the
obligatory
decree
that
barrent
be
cleansed
of
memory
then
the
dream
turned
into
a
kaleidoscope
of
horror
barrent
was
climbing
a
slippery
pole
a
sheer
mountainside
a
well
behind
him
gaining
on
him
was
therkaler
corpse
with
its
chest
ripped
open
supporting
the
corpse
on
either
side
were
the
informer
and
the
judge
barrent
ran
down
a
hill
a
street
a
rooftop
his
pursuers
were
close
behind
him
he
entered
a
dim
yellow
room
closed
and
locked
the
door
when
he
turned
around
he
saw
that
he
had
locked
himself
in
with
therkaler
corpse
fungus
was
blossoming
in
the
open
wound
in
the
chest
and
the
scarred
head
was
crowned
with
red
and
purple
mold
the
corpse
advanced
reached
for
him
and
barrent
dived
headfirst
through
the
window
out
of
it
barrent
you
overdoing
it
come
out
of
the
barrent
had
no
time
to
listen
the
window
turned
into
a
chute
and
he
slid
down
its
polished
sides
into
an
amphitheatre
there
across
gray
sand
the
corpse
crept
toward
him
on
the
stubs
of
arms
and
legs
the
enormous
grandstand
was
empty
except
for
the
judge
and
the
informer
who
sat
side
by
side
watching
well
i
warned
him
out
of
the
dream
barrent
this
is
doctor
wayn
you
on
omega
in
the
dream
shop
come
out
of
the
dream
there
still
time
if
you
pull
yourself
out
omega
dream
there
was
no
time
to
think
about
it
barrent
was
swimming
across
a
dark
lake
the
judge
and
the
informer
were
swimming
just
behind
him
flanking
the
corpse
whose
skin
was
slowly
peeling
away
and
now
the
lake
was
turning
into
a
thick
jelly
which
clung
to
his
arms
and
legs
and
filled
his
mouth
while
the
judge
and
the
informer
barrent
opened
his
eyes
and
found
himself
on
the
adjustable
bed
in
the
dream
shop
doctor
wayn
looking
somewhat
shaken
was
standing
over
him
a
nurse
was
near
by
with
a
tray
of
hypodermics
and
an
oxygen
mask
behind
her
was
arkdragen
wiping
perspiration
from
his
forehead
i
did
think
you
were
going
to
make
it
doctor
wayn
said
i
really
did
he
pulled
out
just
in
time
the
nurse
said
i
warned
him
arkdragen
said
and
left
the
room
barrent
sat
up
what
happened
he
asked
doctor
wayn
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
hard
to
tell
perhaps
you
were
prone
to
circular
reaction
and
sometimes
the
drugs
are
absolutely
pure
but
these
things
usually
do
happen
more
than
once
believe
me
citizen
barrent
the
drug
experience
is
very
pleasant
i
sure
enjoy
it
the
second
time
still
shaken
by
his
experience
barrent
was
certain
there
would
be
no
second
time
for
him
whatever
the
cost
he
was
not
going
to
risk
a
repetition
of
that
nightmare
am
i
addicted
now
he
asked
oh
no
doctor
wayn
said
addiction
occurs
with
the
third
or
fourth
visit
barrent
thanked
him
and
left
he
passed
arkdragen
desk
and
asked
how
much
he
owed
nothing
arkdragen
said
the
first
visit
is
always
on
the
house
he
gave
barrent
a
knowing
smile
barrent
left
the
dream
shop
and
hurried
home
to
his
apartment
he
had
a
lot
to
think
about
now
for
the
first
time
he
had
proof
that
he
was
a
willful
and
premeditated
murderer
chapter
nine
being
accused
of
a
murder
you
ca
remember
is
one
thing
remembering
a
murder
you
have
been
accused
of
is
another
thing
entirely
such
evidence
is
hard
to
disbelieve
barrent
tried
to
sort
out
his
feelings
on
the
matter
before
his
visit
to
the
dream
shop
he
had
never
felt
himself
a
murderer
no
matter
what
the
earth
authorities
had
accused
him
of
at
worst
he
had
thought
that
he
might
have
killed
a
man
in
a
sudden
uncontrollable
fit
of
rage
but
to
plan
and
perform
a
murder
in
cold
blood
why
had
he
done
it
had
his
lust
for
revenge
been
so
great
as
to
throw
off
all
the
restraint
of
earth
civilization
apparently
so
he
had
killed
and
someone
had
informed
on
him
and
a
judge
had
sentenced
him
to
omega
he
was
a
murderer
on
a
criminal
planet
to
live
here
successfully
he
simply
had
to
follow
his
natural
bias
toward
murder
and
yet
barrent
found
this
extremely
difficult
to
do
he
had
surprisingly
little
taste
for
bloodshed
on
free
citizen
day
although
he
went
into
the
streets
with
his
needlebeam
he
could
bring
himself
to
slaughter
any
of
the
lower
classes
he
did
want
to
kill
it
was
a
ridiculous
prejudice
considering
where
and
what
he
was
but
there
it
was
no
matter
how
often
tem
rend
or
joe
lectured
him
on
his
citizen
duties
barrent
still
found
murder
quite
distasteful
he
sought
the
aid
of
a
psychiatrist
who
told
him
that
his
rejection
of
murder
had
its
roots
in
an
unhappy
childhood
the
phobia
had
been
further
complicated
by
the
traumatic
qualities
of
his
experience
in
the
dream
shop
because
of
this
murder
the
highest
social
good
had
become
repugnant
to
him
this
antimurder
neurosis
in
a
man
eminently
suited
for
the
art
of
killing
would
the
psychiatrist
said
inevitably
lead
to
barrent
destruction
the
only
solution
was
to
displace
the
neurosis
the
psychiatrist
suggested
immediate
treatment
in
a
sanitarium
for
the
criminally
barrent
visited
a
sanitarium
and
heard
the
mad
inmates
screaming
about
goodness
fair
play
the
sanctity
of
life
and
other
obscenities
he
had
no
intention
of
joining
them
perhaps
he
was
sick
but
he
was
sick
his
friends
told
him
that
his
uncooperative
attitude
was
bound
to
get
him
into
trouble
barrent
agreed
but
he
hoped
by
killing
only
when
it
became
necessary
that
he
would
escape
the
observation
of
the
highly
placed
individuals
who
administered
the
law
for
several
weeks
his
plan
seemed
to
work
he
ignored
the
increasingly
peremptory
notes
from
the
dream
shop
and
did
not
return
to
services
at
the
wee
coven
business
prospered
and
barrent
spent
his
spare
time
studying
the
effects
of
the
rarer
poisons
and
practicing
with
his
needlebeam
he
often
thought
about
the
girl
he
still
had
the
gun
she
had
lent
him
he
wondered
if
he
would
ever
see
her
again
and
he
thought
about
earth
since
his
visit
to
the
dream
shop
he
had
occasional
flashes
of
recall
isolated
pictures
of
a
weathered
stone
building
a
stand
of
live
oaks
the
curve
of
a
river
seen
through
willows
this
earth
filled
him
with
an
almost
unbearable
longing
like
most
of
the
citizens
of
omega
his
only
real
wish
was
to
go
home
and
that
was
impossible
the
days
passed
and
when
trouble
came
it
came
unexpectedly
one
night
there
was
a
heavy
knocking
at
his
door
half
asleep
barrent
answered
it
four
uniformed
men
pushed
their
way
inside
and
told
him
he
was
under
arrest
what
for
barrent
asked
addiction
one
of
the
men
told
him
you
have
three
minutes
to
dress
what
the
penalty
you
find
out
in
court
the
man
said
he
winked
at
the
other
guards
and
added
but
the
only
way
to
cure
a
nonaddict
is
to
kill
him
eh
barrent
dressed
he
was
taken
to
a
room
in
the
sprawling
department
of
justice
the
room
was
called
the
kangaroo
court
in
honor
of
ancient
judicial
proceeding
across
the
hall
from
it
also
of
antique
derivation
was
the
star
chamber
just
past
that
was
the
court
of
last
appeal
the
kangaroo
court
was
divided
in
half
by
a
high
wooden
screen
for
it
was
fundamental
to
omegan
justice
that
the
accused
should
not
see
his
judge
nor
any
of
the
witnesses
against
him
let
the
prisoner
rise
a
voice
said
from
behind
the
screen
the
voice
thin
flat
and
emotionless
came
through
a
small
amplifier
barrent
could
barely
understand
the
words
tone
and
inflection
were
lost
as
had
been
planned
for
even
in
speaking
the
judge
remained
anonymous
will
barrent
the
judge
said
you
have
been
brought
before
this
court
on
a
major
charge
of
addiction
and
a
minor
charge
of
religious
impiety
on
the
minor
count
we
have
the
sworn
statement
of
a
priest
on
the
major
count
we
have
the
testimony
of
the
dream
shop
can
you
refute
either
of
these
charges
barrent
thought
for
a
moment
then
answered
no
sir
i
ca
for
the
present
the
judge
said
your
religious
impiety
can
be
waived
since
it
is
a
first
offense
but
addiction
is
a
major
crime
against
the
state
of
omega
the
uninterrupted
use
of
drugs
is
an
enforced
privilege
of
every
citizen
it
is
well
known
that
privileges
must
be
exercised
otherwise
they
will
be
lost
to
lose
our
privileges
would
be
to
lose
the
very
cornerstone
of
our
liberty
therefore
to
reject
or
otherwise
fail
to
perform
a
privilege
is
tantamount
to
high
treason
there
was
a
pause
the
guards
shuffled
their
feet
restlessly
barrent
who
considered
his
situation
hopeless
stood
at
attention
and
waited
drugs
serve
many
purposes
the
hidden
judge
went
on
i
need
not
enumerate
their
desirable
qualities
for
the
user
but
speaking
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
state
i
will
tell
you
that
an
addicted
populace
is
a
loyal
populace
that
drugs
are
a
major
source
of
tax
revenue
that
drugs
exemplify
our
entire
way
of
life
furthermore
i
say
to
you
that
the
nonaddicted
minorities
have
invariably
proven
hostile
to
native
omegan
institutions
i
give
you
this
lengthy
explanation
will
barrent
in
order
that
you
may
better
understand
the
sentence
which
is
to
be
passed
upon
you
sir
barrent
said
i
was
wrong
in
avoiding
addiction
i
wo
plead
ignorance
because
i
know
the
law
does
recognize
that
excuse
but
i
will
ask
you
most
humbly
for
another
chance
i
ask
you
to
remember
sir
that
addiction
and
rehabilitation
are
still
possible
for
me
the
court
recognizes
that
the
judge
said
for
that
reason
the
court
is
pleased
to
exercise
its
fullest
powers
of
judicial
mercy
instead
of
summary
execution
you
may
choose
between
two
lesser
decrees
the
first
is
punitive
that
you
shall
suffer
the
loss
of
your
right
hand
and
left
leg
in
atonement
for
your
crime
against
the
state
but
that
you
shall
not
lose
your
life
barrent
gulped
and
asked
what
is
the
other
decree
sir
the
other
decree
which
is
nonpunitive
is
that
you
shall
undergo
a
trial
by
ordeal
and
that
if
you
survive
such
a
trial
you
shall
be
returned
to
appropriate
rank
and
position
in
society
i
take
the
trial
by
ordeal
barrent
said
very
well
said
the
judge
let
the
case
proceed
barrent
was
led
from
the
room
behind
him
he
heard
a
quickly
concealed
laugh
from
one
of
the
guards
had
he
chosen
wrong
he
wondered
could
a
trial
by
ordeal
be
worse
than
outright
mutilation
chapter
ten
on
omega
so
the
saying
went
you
could
fit
a
knife
blade
between
the
trial
and
the
execution
of
the
sentence
barrent
was
taken
at
once
to
a
large
circular
stone
room
in
the
basement
of
the
department
of
justice
white
arc
lights
glared
down
at
him
from
a
high
arched
ceiling
below
one
section
of
wall
had
been
cut
away
to
provide
a
reviewing
stand
for
spectators
the
stands
were
almost
filled
when
barrent
arrived
and
hawkers
were
selling
copies
of
the
day
legal
calendar
for
a
few
moments
barrent
was
alone
on
the
stone
floor
then
a
panel
slid
away
in
one
curved
wall
and
a
small
machine
rolled
out
a
loudspeaker
set
high
in
the
reviewing
stand
announced
ladies
and
gentlemen
your
attention
please
you
are
about
to
witness
trial
by
ordeal
between
citizen
will
barrent
and
gme
take
your
seats
please
the
contest
will
begin
in
a
few
minutes
barrent
looked
over
his
opponent
it
was
a
glistening
black
machine
shaped
like
a
standing
almost
four
feet
high
it
rolled
restlessly
back
and
forth
on
small
wheels
a
pattern
of
red
green
and
amber
lights
from
recessed
glass
bulbs
flashed
across
its
smooth
metal
hide
it
stirred
in
barrent
a
vague
memory
of
some
creature
from
oceans
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
visiting
our
gallery
for
the
first
time
the
loudspeaker
said
a
word
of
explanation
is
in
order
the
prisoner
will
barrent
has
freely
chosen
the
trial
by
ordeal
the
instrument
of
justice
which
in
this
instance
is
gme
is
an
example
of
the
finest
creative
engineering
which
omega
has
produced
the
machine
or
max
as
its
many
friends
and
admirers
call
it
is
a
murder
weapon
of
exemplary
efficiency
able
to
utilize
no
less
than
killing
modes
many
of
them
extremely
painful
for
trial
purposes
it
is
set
to
operate
upon
a
random
principle
this
means
that
max
has
no
choice
over
the
way
in
which
it
kills
the
modes
are
selected
and
abandoned
by
a
random
arrangement
of
numbers
linked
to
an
equally
random
of
one
to
six
seconds
max
suddenly
moved
toward
the
center
of
the
room
and
barrent
backed
away
from
it
it
is
within
the
prisoner
power
the
loudspeaker
voice
continued
to
disable
the
machine
in
which
case
the
prisoner
wins
the
contest
and
is
set
free
with
full
rights
and
privileges
of
his
station
the
method
of
disabling
varies
from
machine
to
machine
it
is
always
theoretically
possible
for
a
prisoner
to
win
practically
speaking
this
has
happened
on
an
average
of
times
out
of
a
hundred
barrent
looked
up
at
the
gallery
of
spectators
to
judge
by
their
dress
they
were
all
men
and
women
of
status
high
in
the
ranks
of
the
privileged
classes
then
he
saw
sitting
in
a
front
row
seat
the
girl
who
had
lent
him
her
gun
on
his
first
day
in
tetrahyde
she
was
as
beautiful
as
he
had
remembered
her
but
no
hint
of
emotion
touched
her
pale
oval
face
she
stared
at
him
with
the
frank
and
detached
interest
of
someone
watching
an
unusual
bug
under
a
jar
let
the
contest
begin
the
loudspeaker
announced
barrent
had
no
more
time
to
think
about
the
girl
for
the
machine
was
rolling
toward
him
he
circled
warily
away
from
it
max
extruded
a
single
slender
tentacle
with
a
white
light
winking
in
the
end
of
it
the
machine
rolled
toward
barrent
backing
him
toward
a
wall
abruptly
it
stopped
barrent
heard
the
clank
of
gears
the
tentacle
was
withdrawn
and
in
its
place
appeared
a
jointed
metal
arm
which
ended
in
a
moving
more
quickly
now
the
machine
cornered
him
against
the
wall
the
arm
flickered
out
but
barrent
managed
to
dodge
it
he
heard
the
scrape
against
stone
when
the
arm
withdrew
barrent
had
a
chance
to
move
again
into
the
center
of
the
room
he
knew
that
his
only
chance
to
disable
the
machine
was
during
the
pause
when
its
selector
changed
it
from
one
killing
mode
to
another
but
how
do
you
disable
a
machine
max
came
at
him
again
and
now
its
metal
hide
glistened
with
a
dull
green
substance
which
barrent
immediately
recognized
as
contact
poison
he
broke
into
a
spring
circling
the
room
trying
to
avoid
the
fatal
touch
the
machine
stopped
neutralizer
washed
over
its
surface
clearing
away
the
poison
then
the
machine
was
coming
toward
him
again
this
time
with
no
weapons
visible
apparently
intending
to
ram
barrent
was
badly
winded
he
dodged
and
the
machine
dodged
with
him
he
was
standing
against
the
wall
helpless
as
the
machine
picked
up
speed
it
stopped
inches
from
him
its
selector
clicked
max
was
extruding
some
sort
of
a
club
this
barrent
thought
was
an
exercise
in
applied
sadism
if
it
went
on
much
longer
the
machine
would
run
him
off
his
feet
and
kill
him
at
its
leisure
whatever
he
was
going
to
do
he
had
better
do
it
at
once
while
he
still
had
the
strength
even
as
he
thought
that
the
machine
swung
a
clubbed
metal
arm
barrent
could
avoid
the
blow
completely
the
club
struck
his
left
shoulder
and
he
felt
his
arm
go
numb
max
was
selecting
again
barrent
threw
himself
on
its
smooth
rounded
back
at
the
very
top
he
saw
two
tiny
holes
praying
that
they
were
air
intake
openings
barrent
plugged
them
with
his
fingers
the
machine
stopped
dead
and
the
audience
roared
barrent
clung
to
the
smooth
surface
with
his
numbed
arm
trying
to
keep
his
fingers
in
the
holes
the
pattern
of
lights
on
max
surface
changed
from
green
through
amber
to
red
its
buzz
became
a
dull
hum
and
then
the
machine
extruded
tubes
as
alternative
intake
holes
barrent
tried
to
cover
them
with
his
body
but
the
machine
roaring
into
sudden
life
swiveled
rapidly
and
threw
him
off
barrent
rolled
to
his
feet
and
moved
back
to
the
center
of
the
arena
the
contest
had
lasted
no
more
than
five
minutes
but
barrent
was
exhausted
he
forced
himself
to
retreat
from
the
machine
which
was
coming
at
him
now
with
a
broad
gleaming
hatchet
as
the
swung
barrent
threw
himself
it
instead
of
away
he
caught
the
arm
in
both
hands
and
bent
it
back
metal
creaked
and
barrent
thought
he
could
hear
the
joint
beginning
to
give
way
if
he
could
break
off
the
metal
arm
he
might
disable
the
machine
at
the
very
least
the
arm
would
be
a
weapon
max
suddenly
went
into
reverse
barrent
tried
to
keep
his
grip
on
the
arm
but
it
was
yanked
away
he
fell
on
his
face
the
hatchet
swung
gouging
his
shoulder
barrent
rolled
over
and
looked
at
the
gallery
he
was
finished
he
might
as
well
accept
the
machine
next
attempt
gracefully
and
have
it
over
with
the
spectators
were
cheering
watching
max
begin
its
transformation
into
another
killing
mode
and
the
girl
was
motioning
to
him
barrent
stared
trying
to
make
some
sense
out
of
it
she
gestured
at
him
to
turn
something
over
turn
it
over
and
destroy
he
had
no
more
time
to
watch
dizzy
from
loss
of
blood
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
watched
the
machine
charge
he
did
bother
to
see
what
weapon
it
had
extruded
his
entire
attention
was
concentrated
on
its
wheels
as
it
came
at
him
barrent
threw
himself
under
the
wheels
the
machine
tried
to
brake
and
swerve
but
not
in
time
the
wheels
rolled
onto
barrent
body
tilting
the
machine
sharply
upward
barrent
grunted
under
the
impact
with
his
back
under
the
machine
he
put
his
remaining
strength
in
an
attempt
to
stand
up
for
a
moment
the
machine
teetered
its
wheels
spinning
wildly
then
it
flipped
over
on
its
back
barrent
collapsed
beside
it
when
he
could
see
again
the
machine
was
still
on
its
back
it
was
extruding
a
set
of
arms
to
turn
itself
over
barrent
threw
himself
on
the
machine
flat
belly
and
hammered
with
his
fists
nothing
happened
he
tried
to
pull
off
one
of
the
wheels
and
could
max
was
propping
itself
up
preparing
to
turn
over
and
resume
the
contest
the
girl
motions
caught
barrent
eye
she
was
making
a
plucking
motion
repeatedly
insistently
only
then
barrent
saw
a
small
fuse
box
near
one
of
the
wheels
he
yanked
off
the
cover
losing
most
of
a
fingernail
in
the
process
and
removed
the
fuse
the
machine
expired
gracefully
barrent
fainted
chapter
eleven
on
omega
the
law
is
supreme
hidden
and
revealed
sacred
and
profane
the
law
governs
the
actions
of
all
citizens
from
the
lowest
of
the
low
to
the
highest
of
the
high
without
the
law
there
could
be
no
privileges
for
those
who
made
the
law
therefore
the
law
was
absolutely
necessary
without
the
law
and
its
stern
enforcement
omega
would
be
an
unthinkable
chaos
in
which
a
man
rights
could
extend
only
as
far
and
as
long
as
he
personally
could
enforce
them
this
anarchy
would
mean
the
end
of
omegan
society
and
particularly
it
would
mean
the
end
of
those
senior
citizens
of
the
ruling
class
who
had
grown
high
in
status
but
whose
skill
with
a
gun
had
long
passed
its
peak
therefore
the
law
was
necessary
but
omega
was
also
a
criminal
society
composed
entirely
of
individuals
who
had
broken
the
laws
of
earth
it
was
a
society
which
in
the
final
analysis
stressed
individual
endeavor
it
was
a
society
in
which
the
lawbreaker
was
king
a
society
in
which
crimes
were
not
only
condoned
but
were
admired
and
even
rewarded
a
society
in
which
deviation
from
the
rules
was
judged
solely
on
its
degree
of
success
and
this
resulted
in
the
paradox
of
a
criminal
society
with
absolute
laws
which
were
meant
to
be
broken
the
judge
still
hidden
behind
his
screen
explained
all
this
to
barrent
several
hours
had
passed
since
the
end
of
the
trial
by
ordeal
barrent
had
been
taken
to
the
infirmary
where
his
injuries
were
patched
up
they
were
minor
for
the
most
part
two
cracked
ribs
a
deep
gouge
in
his
left
shoulder
and
various
cuts
and
bruises
accordingly
the
judge
went
on
the
law
must
simultaneously
be
broken
and
not
broken
those
who
never
break
a
law
never
rise
in
status
they
are
usually
killed
off
in
one
way
or
another
since
they
lack
the
necessary
initiative
to
survive
for
those
who
like
yourself
break
laws
the
situation
is
somewhat
different
the
law
punishes
them
with
absolute
severity
they
can
get
away
with
the
judge
paused
in
a
thoughtful
voice
he
continued
the
highest
type
of
man
on
omega
is
the
individual
who
understands
the
laws
appreciates
their
necessity
knows
the
penalties
for
infraction
then
breaks
them
and
succeeds
that
sir
is
your
ideal
criminal
and
your
ideal
omegan
and
that
is
what
you
have
succeeded
in
doing
will
barrent
by
winning
the
trial
by
ordeal
thank
you
sir
barrent
said
i
wish
you
to
understand
the
judge
continued
that
success
in
breaking
the
law
once
does
not
imply
that
you
will
succeed
a
second
time
the
odds
are
increasingly
against
you
each
time
you
try
just
as
the
rewards
are
increasingly
greater
if
you
succeed
therefore
i
counsel
you
not
to
act
rashly
upon
your
new
acquisition
of
knowledge
i
wo
sir
barrent
said
very
well
you
are
hereby
elevated
to
the
status
of
privileged
citizen
with
all
the
rights
and
obligations
which
that
entails
you
are
allowed
to
keep
your
business
as
before
furthermore
you
are
granted
a
free
vacation
in
the
lake
of
clouds
region
and
you
may
go
on
that
vacation
with
any
female
of
your
choice
i
beg
pardon
barrent
said
what
was
that
last
a
week
vacation
the
hidden
judge
repeated
with
any
female
of
your
choice
it
is
a
high
reward
since
men
outnumber
women
on
omega
by
six
to
one
you
may
pick
any
unmarried
woman
willing
or
unwilling
i
will
grant
you
three
days
in
which
to
make
a
choice
i
do
need
three
days
barrent
said
i
want
the
girl
who
was
sitting
in
the
front
row
of
the
spectators
gallery
the
girl
with
black
hair
and
green
eyes
do
you
know
which
one
i
mean
yes
the
judge
said
slowly
i
know
which
one
you
mean
her
name
is
moera
ermais
i
suggest
that
you
choose
someone
else
is
there
any
reason
no
but
you
would
be
much
better
advised
if
you
selected
someone
else
my
clerk
will
be
pleased
to
furnish
you
with
a
list
of
suitable
young
ladies
all
of
them
have
affidavits
of
good
performance
several
are
graduates
of
the
women
institute
which
as
you
perhaps
know
gives
a
rigorous
course
in
the
geishan
arts
and
sciences
i
can
personally
recommend
your
attention
to
moera
is
the
one
i
want
barrent
said
young
man
you
err
in
your
judgment
i
have
to
take
that
chance
very
well
the
judge
said
your
vacation
starts
at
nine
tomorrow
morning
i
sincerely
wish
you
good
fortune
guards
escorted
barrent
from
the
judge
chambers
and
he
was
taken
back
to
his
shop
his
friends
who
had
been
waiting
for
the
death
announcement
came
to
congratulate
him
they
were
eager
to
hear
the
complete
details
of
the
trial
by
ordeal
but
barrent
had
learned
now
that
secret
knowledge
was
the
road
to
power
he
gave
them
only
the
sketchiest
outline
there
was
another
cause
for
celebration
that
night
tem
application
had
finally
been
accepted
by
the
assassin
guild
as
he
had
promised
he
was
taking
foeren
on
as
his
assistant
the
following
morning
barrent
opened
his
shop
and
saw
a
vehicle
in
front
of
his
door
it
had
been
provided
for
his
vacation
by
the
department
of
justice
sitting
in
the
back
looking
beautiful
and
very
annoyed
was
moera
she
said
are
you
out
of
your
mind
barrent
do
you
think
i
have
time
for
this
sort
of
thing
why
did
you
pick
me
you
saved
my
life
barrent
said
and
i
suppose
you
think
that
means
i
interested
in
you
well
not
if
you
have
any
gratitude
you
tell
the
driver
that
changed
your
mind
you
can
still
choose
another
girl
barrent
shook
his
head
you
the
only
girl
i
interested
in
then
you
wo
reconsider
not
a
chance
moera
sighed
and
leaned
back
are
you
interested
in
me
much
more
than
interested
barrent
said
well
moera
said
if
you
wo
change
your
mind
i
suppose
i
just
have
to
put
up
with
you
she
turned
away
but
before
she
did
barrent
caught
the
faintest
suggestion
of
a
smile
chapter

the

was
omega
finest
vacation
resort
upon
entering
the
district
all
weapons
had
to
be
checked
at
the
main
gate
no
duels
were
allowed
under
any
circumstances
quarrels
were
arbitrarily
decided
by
the
nearest
barman
and
murder
was
punished
by
immediate
loss
of
all
status
every
amusement
was
available
at
the

there
were
the
exhibitions
such
as
fencing
bouts
bull
fighting
and

baiting
there
were
sports
like
swimming

climbing
and
skiing
in
the
evenings
there
was
dancing
in
the
main
ballroom
behind
glass
walls
which
separated
residents
from
citizens
and
citizens
from
the
elite
there
was
a

containing
anything
the
fashionable
addict
could
desire
as
well
as
a

he
might
wish

in

beneath

but
most
important
of
all
there
were
gently
rolling
hills
and
shadowy
woods
to
walk
in
free
from
the
tensions
of
the
daily
struggle
for
existence
in
tetrahyde
barrent
and
moera
had
adjoining
rooms
and
the
door
between
them
was
unlocked
but
on
the
first
night
barrent
did
not
go
through
the
door
moera
had
given
no
sign
of
wanting
him
to
do
so
and
on
a
planet
where
women
have
easy
and
continual
access
to
poisons
a
man
had
to
think
twice
before
inflicting
his
company
where
it
was
not
wanted
even
the
owner
of
an
antidote
shop
had
to
consider
the
possibility
of
not
being
able
to
recognize
his
own
symptoms
in
time
on
their
second
day
they
climbed
high
into
the
hills
they
ate
a
basket
lunch
on
a
grassy
incline
which
sloped
away
to
the
gray
sea
after
they
had
eaten
barrent
asked
moera
why
she
had
saved
his
life
you
wo
like
the
answer
she
told
him
i
still
like
to
hear
it
well
you
looked
so
ridiculously
vulnerable
that
day
in
the
society
i
would
have
helped
anyone
who
looked
that
way
barrent
nodded
uncomfortably
what
about
the
second
time
by
then
i
suppose
i
had
an
interest
in
you
not
a
romantic
interest
you
understand
i
not
at
all
romantic
what
kind
of
an
interest
barrent
asked
i
thought
you
might
be
good
recruitment
material
i
like
to
hear
more
about
it
barrent
said
moera
was
silent
for
a
while
watching
him
with
unblinking
green
eyes
she
said
there
not
much
i
can
tell
you
i
a
member
of
an
organization
we
always
on
the
lookout
for
good
prospects
usually
we
screen
directly
from
the
prison
ships
after
that
recruiters
like
me
go
out
in
search
of
people
we
can
use
what
type
of
people
do
you
look
for
not
your
type
will
i
sorry
why
not
me
at
first
i
thought
seriously
about
recruiting
you
moera
said
you
seemed
like
just
the
sort
of
person
we
needed
then
i
checked
into
your
record
and
we
do
recruit
murderers
sometimes
we
employ
them
for
specific
jobs
but
we
do
take
them
into
the
organization
there
are
certain
extenuating
circumstances
which
we
recognize
for
example
but
aside
from
that
we
feel
that
a
man
who
has
committed
premeditated
murder
on
earth
is
the
wrong
man
for
us
i
see
barrent
said
would
it
help
any
if
i
told
you
i
do
have
the
usual
omegan
attitude
toward
murder
i
know
you
do
moera
said
if
it
were
up
to
me
i
take
you
into
the
organization
but
it
not
my
choice
will
are
you
sure
you
a
murderer
i
believe
i
am
barrent
said
i
probably
am
too
bad
moera
said
still
the
organization
needs
types
no
matter
what
they
did
on
earth
i
ca
promise
anything
but
i
see
what
i
can
do
it
would
help
if
you
could
find
out
more
about
why
you
committed
murder
perhaps
there
were
extenuating
circumstances
perhaps
barrent
said
doubtfully
i
try
to
find
out
that
evening
just
before
he
went
to
sleep
moera
opened
the
adjoining
door
and
came
into
his
room
slim
and
warm
she
slipped
into
his
bed
when
he
started
to
speak
she
put
a
hand
over
his
mouth
and
barrent
who
had
learned
not
to
question
good
fortune
kept
quiet
the
rest
of
the
vacation
passed
much
too
quickly
the
subject
of
the
organization
did
not
come
up
again
but
perhaps
as
compensation
the
adjoining
door
was
not
closed
at
last
late
on
the
seventh
day
barrent
and
moera
returned
to
tetrahyde
when
can
i
see
you
again
barrent
asked
i
get
in
touch
with
you
that
not
a
very
satisfactory
arrangement
it
the
best
i
can
do
moera
said
i
sorry
will
i
see
what
i
can
do
about
the
organization
barrent
had
to
be
satisfied
with
that
when
the
vehicle
dropped
him
at
his
store
he
still
did
know
where
she
lived
or
what
kind
of
an
organization
she
represented
back
in
his
apartment
he
considered
carefully
the
details
of
his
dream
in
the
dream
shop
it
was
all
there
his
anger
at
therkaler
the
illicit
weapon
the
encounter
the
corpse
and
then
the
informer
and
the
judge
only
one
thing
was
missing
he
had
no
recollection
of
the
actual
murder
no
memory
of
aiming
the
weapon
and
activating
it
the
dream
stopped
when
he
met
therkaler
and
started
again
after
he
was
dead
perhaps
he
had
blocked
the
moment
of
actual
murder
out
of
his
mind
but
perhaps
there
had
been
some
provocation
some
satisfactory
reason
why
he
had
killed
the
man
he
would
have
to
find
out
there
were
only
two
ways
of
getting
information
about
earth
one
lay
through
the
visions
of
the
dream
shop
and
he
was
determined
not
to
go
there
again
the
other
way
was
through
the
services
of
a
skrenning
mutant
barrent
had
the
usual
distaste
for
mutants
they
were
another
race
entirely
and
their
status
of
untouchability
was
no
mere
prejudice
it
was
well
known
that
mutants
often
carried
strange
and
incurable
diseases
they
were
shunned
and
they
had
reacted
to
exclusion
by
exclusiveness
they
lived
in
the
mutant
quarter
which
was
almost
a
city
within
tetrahyde
citizens
with
good
sense
stayed
away
from
the
quarter
especially
after
dark
everyone
knew
that
mutants
could
be
vindictive
but
only
mutants
had
the
skrenning
ability
in
their
misshapen
bodies
were
unusual
powers
and
talents
odd
and
abnormal
abilities
which
the
normal
man
shunned
by
day
but
secretly
courted
by
night
mutants
were
said
to
be
in
the
particular
favor
of
the
black
one
some
people
felt
that
the
great
art
of
black
magic
about
which
the
priests
boasted
could
only
be
performed
by
a
mutant
but
one
never
said
so
in
the
presence
of
a
priest
mutants
because
of
their
strange
talents
were
reputed
to
remember
much
more
of
earth
than
was
possible
for
normal
men
and
women
not
only
could
they
remember
earth
in
general
but
in
particular
they
could
skren
the
of
a
man
backward
through
space
and
time
pierce
the
wall
of
forgetfulness
and
tell
what
really
had
happened
to
him
other
people
believed
that
mutants
had
no
unusual
abilities
at
all
they
considered
them
clever
rogues
who
lived
off
people
credulity
barrent
decided
to
find
out
for
himself
late
one
night
suitably
cloaked
and
armed
he
left
his
apartment
and
went
to
the
mutant
quarter
chapter
thirteen
barrent
walked
through
the
narrow
twisting
streets
of
the
quarter
one
hand
never
far
from
his
weapon
he
walked
among
the
lame
and
the
blind
past
hydrocephaloid
and
microcephalous
idiots
past
a
juggler
who
kept
twelve
flaming
torches
in
the
air
with
the
aid
of
a
rudimentary
third
hand
growing
out
of
his
chest
there
were
vendors
selling
clothing
charms
and
jewelry
there
were
carts
loaded
with
pungent
and
food
he
walked
past
a
row
of
brightly
painted
brothels
girls
crowded
the
windows
and
shrieked
at
him
and
a
woman
told
him
he
was
just
in
time
for
the
delphian
rites
barrent
turned
away
from
her
and
almost
ran
into
a
monstrously
fat
woman
who
pulled
open
her
blouse
to
reveal
eight
shrunken
breasts
he
ducked
around
her
moving
quickly
past
four
linked
siamese
quadruplets
who
stared
at
him
with
huge
mournful
eyes
barrent
turned
a
corner
and
stopped
a
tall
ragged
old
man
with
a
cane
was
blocking
his
way
the
man
was
the
skin
had
grown
smooth
and
hairless
over
the
socket
where
his
left
eye
should
have
been
but
his
right
eye
was
sharp
and
fierce
under
a
white
eyebrow
you
wish
the
services
of
a
genuine
skrenner
the
old
man
asked
barrent
nodded
follow
me
the
mutant
said
he
turned
into
an
alley
and
barrent
came
after
him
gripping
the
butt
of
his
needlebeam
tightly
mutants
were
forbidden
by
law
to
carry
arms
but
like
this
old
man
most
of
them
had
heavy
walking
sticks
at
close
quarters
no
one
could
ask
for
a
better
weapon
the
old
man
opened
a
door
and
motioned
barrent
inside
barrent
paused
thinking
about
the
stories
he
had
heard
of
gullible
citizens
falling
into
mutant
hands
then
he
his
needlebeam
and
went
inside
at
the
end
of
a
long
passageway
the
old
man
opened
a
door
and
led
barrent
into
a
small
dimly
lighted
room
as
his
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
dark
barrent
could
make
out
the
shapes
of
two
women
sitting
in
front
of
a
plain
wooden
table
there
was
a
pan
of
water
on
the
table
and
in
the
pan
was
a
piece
of
glass
cut
into
many
facets
one
of
the
women
was
very
old
and
completely
hairless
the
other
was
young
and
beautiful
as
barrent
moved
closer
to
the
table
he
saw
with
a
sense
of
shock
that
her
legs
were
joined
below
the
knee
by
a
membrane
of
scaly
skin
and
her
feet
were
of
a
rudimentary
shape
what
do
you
wish
us
to
skren
for
you
citizen
barrent
the
young
woman
asked
how
did
you
know
my
name
barrent
asked
when
he
got
no
answer
he
said
all
right
i
want
to
find
out
about
a
murder
i
committed
on
earth
why
do
you
want
to
find
out
about
it
the
young
woman
asked
the
authorities
credit
it
to
your
record
they
credit
it
but
i
want
to
find
out
why
i
did
it
maybe
there
were
extenuating
circumstances
maybe
i
did
it
in
is
it
really
important
the
young
woman
asked
i
think
so
barrent
said
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
took
the
plunge
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
have
a
neurotic
prejudice
against
murder
i
would
rather
kill
so
i
want
to
find
out
why
i
committed
murder
on
earth
the
mutants
looked
at
each
other
then
the
old
man
grinned
and
said
citizen
we
help
you
all
we
can
we
mutants
also
have
a
prejudice
against
killing
since
it
always
someone
else
killing
us
we
all
in
favor
of
citizens
with
a
neurosis
against
murder
then
you
skren
my
past
it
not
as
easy
as
that
the
young
woman
said
the
skrenning
ability
which
is
one
of
a
cluster
of
psi
talents
is
difficult
to
use
it
does
always
function
and
when
it
does
function
it
often
reveal
what
it
supposed
to
i
thought
all
mutants
could
look
into
the
past
whenever
they
wanted
to
barrent
said
no
the
old
man
told
him
that
is
true
for
one
thing
not
all
of
us
who
are
classified
mutants
are
true
mutants
almost
any
deformity
or
abnormality
these
days
is
called
mutantism
it
a
handy
term
to
cover
anyone
who
does
conform
to
the
terran
standard
of
appearance
but
some
of
you
are
true
mutants
certainly
but
even
then
there
are
different
types
of
mutantism
some
just
show
radiation
abnormalities
giantism
microcephaly
and
the
like
only
a
few
of
us
possess
the
slightest
psi
abilities
although
all
mutants
claim
them
are
you
able
to
skren
barrent
asked
him
no
but
myla
can
he
said
pointing
to
the
young
woman
sometimes
she
can
the
young
woman
was
staring
into
the
pan
of
water
into
the
faceted
glass
her
pale
eyes
were
open
very
wide
showing
almost
all
pupil
and
her
body
was
rigidly
upright
supported
by
the
old
woman
she
beginning
to
see
something
the
man
said
the
water
and
the
glass
are
just
devices
to
focus
her
attention
myla
good
at
skrenning
though
sometimes
she
gets
the
future
confused
with
the
past
that
sort
of
thing
is
embarrassing
and
it
gives
skrenning
a
bad
name
it
ca
be
helped
though
every
once
in
a
while
the
future
is
there
in
the
water
and
myla
has
to
tell
what
she
sees
last
week
she
told
a
hadji
he
was
going
to
die
in
four
days
the
old
man
chuckled
you
should
have
seen
the
expression
on
his
face
did
she
see
how
he
would
die
barrent
asked
yes
by
a
the
poor
man
stayed
in
his
house
for
the
entire
four
days
was
he
killed
of
course
his
wife
killed
him
she
was
a
woman
told
barrent
hoped
that
myla
would
skren
any
future
for
him
life
was
difficult
enough
without
a
mutant
predictions
to
make
it
worse
she
was
looking
up
from
the
faceted
glass
now
shaking
her
head
sadly
there
very
little
i
can
tell
you
i
was
not
able
to
see
the
murder
performed
but
i
skrenned
a
graveyard
and
in
it
i
saw
your
tombstone
it
was
an
old
tombstone
perhaps
twenty
years
old
the
graveyard
was
on
the
outskirts
of
a
place
on
earth
called
youngerstun
barrent
reflected
a
moment
but
the
name
meant
nothing
to
him
also
myla
said
i
skrenned
a
man
who
knows
about
the
murder
he
can
tell
you
about
it
if
he
will
this
man
saw
the
murder
yes
is
he
the
man
who
informed
on
me
i
do
know
myla
said
i
skrenned
the
corpse
whose
name
was
therkaler
and
there
was
a
man
standing
near
it
that
man
name
was
illiardi
is
he
here
on
omega
yes
you
can
find
him
right
now
in
the
euphoriatorium
on
little
axe
street
do
you
know
where
that
is
i
can
find
it
barrent
said
he
thanked
the
girl
and
offered
payment
which
she
refused
to
take
she
looked
very
unhappy
as
barrent
was
leaving
she
called
out
be
careful
barrent
stopped
at
the
door
and
felt
an
icy
chill
settle
across
his
chest
did
you
skren
my
future
he
asked
only
a
little
myla
said
only
a
few
months
ahead
what
did
you
see
i
ca
explain
it
she
said
what
i
saw
is
impossible
tell
me
what
it
was
i
saw
you
dead
and
yet
you
were
dead
at
all
you
were
looking
at
a
corpse
which
was
shattered
into
shiny
fragments
but
the
corpse
was
also
you
what
does
it
mean
i
do
know
myla
said
the
euphoriatorium
was
a
large
garish
place
which
specialized
in
drugs
and
aphrodisiacs
it
catered
mostly
to
a
peon
and
resident
clientele
barrent
felt
out
of
status
as
he
shouldered
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
asked
a
waiter
where
he
could
find
a
man
named
illiardi
the
waiter
pointed
in
a
corner
booth
barrent
saw
a
bald
man
sitting
over
a
tiny
glass
of
thanapiquita
barrent
went
over
and
introduced
himself
pleased
to
meet
you
sir
illiardi
said
showing
the
obligatory
respect
of
a
second
class
resident
for
a
privileged
citizen
how
can
i
be
of
service
i
want
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
about
earth
barrent
said
i
ca
remember
much
about
the
place
illiardi
said
but
welcome
to
anything
i
know
do
you
remember
a
man
named
therkaler
certainly
illiardi
said
thin
fellow
as
mean
a
man
as
you
could
find
were
you
present
when
he
was
killed
i
was
there
it
was
the
first
thing
i
remembered
when
i
got
off
the
ship
did
you
see
who
killed
him
illiardi
looked
puzzled
i
did
have
to
see
killed
him
barrent
forced
himself
to
speak
in
a
calm
steady
voice
are
you
sure
of
that
are
you
absolutely
certain
of
course
i
sure
illiardi
said
and
i
fight
any
man
who
tries
to
take
credit
for
it
i
killed
therkaler
and
he
deserved
worse
than
that
when
you
killed
him
barrent
asked
did
you
see
anywhere
around
illiardi
looked
at
him
carefully
then
shook
his
head
no
i
think
i
saw
you
but
i
ca
be
sure
right
after
i
killed
therkaler
everything
goes
sort
of
blank
thank
you
barrent
said
he
left
the
euphoriatorium
chapter
fourteen
barrent
had
much
to
think
about
but
the
more
he
thought
the
more
he
became
confused
if
illiardi
had
killed
therkaler
why
had
barrent
been
deported
to
omega
if
an
honest
mistake
had
been
made
why
had
he
been
released
when
the
true
murderer
was
discovered
why
had
someone
on
earth
accused
him
of
a
crime
he
had
committed
and
why
had
a
false
memory
of
that
crime
been
superimposed
on
his
mind
just
beneath
the
conscious
level
barrent
had
no
answers
for
his
questions
but
he
knew
that
he
had
never
felt
like
a
murderer
now
he
had
proof
of
sorts
that
he
was
a
murderer
the
sensation
of
innocence
changed
everything
for
him
he
had
less
tolerance
for
omegan
ways
and
no
interest
at
all
in
conforming
to
a
criminal
mode
of
life
the
only
thing
he
wanted
was
to
escape
from
omega
and
return
to
his
rightful
heritage
on
earth
but
that
was
impossible
day
and
night
the
guardships
circled
overhead
even
if
there
had
been
some
way
of
evading
them
escape
would
still
have
been
impossible
omegan
technology
had
progressed
only
as
far
as
the
internal
combustion
engine
the
only
starships
were
commanded
by
earth
forces
barrent
continued
to
work
in
the
antidote
shop
but
his
lack
of
public
spirit
was
growing
apparent
he
ignored
invitations
from
the
dream
shop
and
never
attended
any
of
the
popular
public
executions
when
roving
mobs
were
formed
to
have
a
little
fun
in
the
mutant
quarter
barrent
usually
pleaded
a
headache
he
never
joined
the
landing
day
hunts
and
he
was
rude
to
an
accredited
salesman
from
the
torture
of
the
month
club
not
even
visits
from
uncle
ingemar
could
make
him
change
his
antireligious
ways
he
knew
he
was
asking
for
trouble
he
expected
trouble
and
the
knowledge
was
strangely
exhilarating
after
all
there
was
nothing
wrong
in
breaking
the
law
on
omega
as
long
as
you
could
get
away
with
it
within
a
month
he
had
a
chance
to
test
his
decision
walking
to
his
shop
one
day
a
man
shoved
against
him
in
a
crowd
barrent
moved
away
and
the
man
grabbed
him
by
a
shoulder
and
pulled
him
around
who
do
you
think
you
pushing
the
man
asked
he
was
short
and
stocky
his
clothes
indicated
privileged
citizen
rank
five
silver
stars
on
his
gunbelt
showed
his
number
of
authorized
kills
i
did
push
you
barrent
said
you
lie
you
the
crowd
became
silent
when
they
heard
the
deadly
insult
barrent
backed
away
waiting
the
man
went
for
his
sidearm
in
a
quick
artistic
draw
but
barrent
needlebeam
was
out
a
full
before
the
man
weapon
had
cleared
his
holster
he
drilled
the
man
neatly
between
the
eyes
then
sensing
movement
behind
him
he
swung
around
two
privileged
citizens
were
drawing
heat
guns
barrent
fired
aiming
automatically
dodging
behind
the
protection
of
a
shop
front
the
men
crumpled
the
wooden
front
buckled
under
the
impact
of
a
projectile
weapon
and
splinters
slashed
his
hand
barrent
saw
a
fourth
man
firing
at
him
from
an
alley
he
brought
the
man
down
with
two
shots
and
that
was
that
in
the
space
of
a
few
seconds
he
had
killed
four
men
although
he
did
think
of
himself
as
having
a
murderer
mentality
barrent
was
pleased
and
elated
he
had
fired
only
in
he
had
given
the
something
to
think
about
they
would
be
so
quick
to
gun
for
him
next
time
quite
possibly
they
would
concentrate
on
easier
targets
and
leave
him
alone
when
he
returned
to
his
shop
he
found
joe
waiting
for
him
the
little
credit
thief
had
a
sour
look
on
his
face
he
said
i
saw
your
fancy
today
very
pretty
thank
you
barrent
said
do
you
think
that
sort
of
thing
will
help
you
do
you
think
you
can
just
go
on
breaking
the
law
i
getting
away
with
it
barrent
said
sure
but
how
long
do
you
think
you
can
keep
it
up
as
long
as
i
have
to
not
a
chance
joe
said
keeps
on
breaking
the
law
and
getting
away
with
it
only
suckers
believe
that
they
better
send
some
good
men
after
me
barrent
said
reloading
his
needlebeam
that
not
how
it
happen
joe
said
believe
me
will
there
no
counting
the
ways
they
have
of
getting
you
once
the
law
decides
to
move
there
be
nothing
you
can
do
to
stop
it
and
do
expect
any
help
from
that
girl
friend
of
yours
either
do
you
know
her
barrent
asked
i
know
everybody
joe
said
moodily
i
got
friends
in
the
government
i
know
that
people
have
had
about
enough
of
you
listen
to
me
will
do
you
want
to
end
up
dead
barrent
shook
his
head
joe
can
you
visit
moera
do
you
know
how
to
reach
her
maybe
joe
said
what
for
i
want
you
to
tell
her
something
barrent
said
i
want
you
to
tell
her
that
i
did
commit
the
murder
i
was
accused
of
on
earth
joe
stared
at
him
are
you
out
of
your
mind
no
i
found
the
man
who
actually
did
it
he
a
second
class
resident
named
illiardi
why
spread
it
around
joe
asked
no
sense
in
losing
credit
for
the
kill
i
did
murder
the
man
barrent
said
i
want
you
to
tell
moera
will
you
i
tell
her
joe
said
if
i
can
locate
her
look
will
you
remember
what
i
said
maybe
you
still
have
time
to
do
something
about
it
go
to
black
mass
or
something
it
might
help
maybe
i
do
that
barrent
said
you
be
sure
to
tell
her
i
tell
her
joe
said
he
left
the
antidote
shop
shaking
his
head
sadly
chapter
fifteen
three
days
later
barrent
received
a
visit
from
a
tall
dignified
man
who
stood
as
rigidly
erect
as
the
ceremonial
sword
that
hung
by
his
side
the
old
man
wore
a
coat
black
pants
and
gleaming
black
boots
from
his
clothing
barrent
knew
he
was
a
high
government
official
the
government
of
omega
sends
you
greetings
said
the
official
i
am
norins
jay
of
games
i
am
here
as
required
by
law
to
inform
you
personally
of
your
good
fortune
barrent
nodded
warily
and
invited
the
old
man
into
his
apartment
but
jay
erect
and
proper
preferred
to
stay
in
the
store
the
yearly
lottery
drawing
was
held
last
night
jay
said
you
citizen
barrent
are
one
of
the
prize
winners
i
congratulate
you
what
is
the
prize
barrent
asked
he
had
heard
of
the
yearly
lottery
but
had
only
a
vague
idea
of
its
significance
the
prize
jay
said
is
honor
and
fame
your
name
inscribed
on
the
civic
rolls
your
record
of
kills
preserved
for
posterity
more
concretely
you
will
receive
a
new
needlebeam
and
afterwards
you
will
be
awarded
posthumously
the
silver
sunburst
decoration
posthumously
of
course
jay
said
the
silver
sunburst
is
always
awarded
after
death
it
is
no
less
an
honor
for
that
i
sure
it
is
barrent
said
is
there
anything
else
just
one
other
thing
jay
said
as
a
lottery
winner
you
will
take
part
in
the
symbolic
ceremony
of
the
hunt
which
marks
the
beginning
of
the
yearly
games
the
hunt
as
you
may
know
personifies
our
omegan
way
of
life
in
the
hunt
we
see
all
the
complex
factors
of
the
dramatic
rise
and
fall
from
grace
combined
with
the
thrill
of
the
duel
and
the
excitement
of
the
chase
even
peons
are
allowed
to
participate
in
the
hunt
for
this
is
the
one
holiday
open
to
all
and
the
one
holiday
that
symbolizes
the
common
man
ability
to
rise
above
the
restraints
of
his
status
if
i
understand
correctly
barrent
said
i
one
of
the
people
who
have
been
chosen
to
be
hunted
yes
jay
said
but
you
said
the
ceremony
is
symbolic
does
that
mean
no
one
gets
killed
not
at
all
jay
said
on
omega
the
symbol
and
the
thing
symbolized
are
usually
one
and
the
same
when
we
say
a
hunt
we
mean
a
true
hunt
otherwise
the
thing
would
be
mere
pageantry
barrent
stopped
a
moment
to
consider
the
situation
it
was
not
a
pleasing
prospect
in
a
duel
he
had
an
excellent
chance
of
survival
but
the
yearly
hunt
in
which
the
entire
population
of
tetrahyde
took
part
gave
him
no
chance
at
all
he
should
have
been
ready
for
a
possibility
like
this
how
was
i
picked
he
asked
by
random
selection
said
norins
jay
no
other
method
would
be
fair
to
the
hunteds
who
give
up
their
lives
for
omega
greater
glory
i
ca
believe
i
was
picked
purely
by
chance
the
selection
was
random
jay
said
it
was
made
of
course
from
a
list
of
suitable
victims
not
everyone
can
be
a
quarry
in
a
hunt
a
man
must
have
demonstrated
a
considerable
degree
of
tenacity
and
skill
before
the
games
committee
would
think
of
considering
him
for
selection
being
hunted
is
an
honor
it
is
not
one
which
we
confer
lightly
i
do
believe
it
barrent
said
you
people
in
the
government
were
out
to
get
me
now
it
seems
you
succeeded
it
as
simple
as
that
not
at
all
i
can
assure
you
that
none
of
us
in
the
government
bear
you
the
slightest
ill
will
you
may
have
heard
foolish
stories
about
vindictive
officials
but
they
simply
are
true
you
have
broken
the
law
but
that
is
no
longer
the
government
concern
now
it
is
entirely
a
matter
between
you
and
the
law
jay
frosty
blue
eyes
flashed
when
he
spoke
of
the
law
his
back
stiffened
and
his
mouth
grew
firm
the
law
he
said
is
above
the
criminal
and
the
judge
and
rules
them
both
the
law
is
inescapable
for
an
action
is
either
lawful
or
unlawful
the
law
indeed
may
be
said
to
have
a
life
of
its
own
an
existence
quite
apart
from
the
finite
lives
of
the
beings
who
administer
it
the
law
governs
every
aspect
of
human
behavior
therefore
to
the
same
extent
that
humans
are
lawful
beings
the
law
is
human
and
being
human
the
law
has
its
idiosyncrasies
just
as
a
man
has
his
for
a
citizen
who
abides
by
the
law
the
law
is
distant
and
difficult
to
find
for
those
who
reject
and
violate
it
the
law
emerges
from
its
musty
sepulchers
and
goes
in
search
of
the
transgressor
and
that
barrent
said
is
why
i
was
chosen
for
the
hunt
of
course
jay
said
if
you
had
not
been
chosen
in
that
way
the
zealous
and
law
would
have
selected
another
means
using
whatever
instruments
were
at
its
disposal
thanks
for
telling
me
barrent
said
how
long
do
i
have
before
the
hunt
begins
until
dawn
the
hunt
begins
then
and
ends
at
dawn
of
the
following
day
what
happens
if
i
not
killed
norins
jay
smiled
faintly
that
does
happen
often
citizen
barrent
i
sure
it
need
not
worry
you
it
happens
does
it
yes
those
who
survive
the
hunt
are
automatically
enrolled
in
the
games
and
if
i
survive
the
games
forget
it
jay
said
in
a
friendly
manner
but
what
if
i
do
believe
me
citizen
you
wo
i
still
would
like
to
know
what
happens
if
i
do
those
who
live
through
the
games
are
beyond
the
law
that
sounds
promising
barrent
said
it
is
the
law
even
at
its
most
threatening
is
still
your
guardian
your
rights
may
be
few
but
the
law
guarantees
their
observance
it
is
because
of
the
law
that
i
do
not
kill
you
here
and
now
jay
opened
his
hand
and
barrent
saw
a
tiny
weapon
the
law
sets
limits
and
acts
as
a
modifier
upon
the
behavior
of
the
lawbreaker
and
the
law
enforcer
to
be
sure
the
law
now
states
that
you
must
die
but
all
men
must
die
the
law
by
its
ponderous
and
introspective
nature
gives
you
time
in
which
to
die
you
have
a
day
at
least
and
without
the
law
you
would
have
no
time
at
all
what
happens
barrent
asked
if
i
survive
the
games
and
pass
beyond
the
law
there
is
only
one
thing
beyond
the
law
norins
jay
said
reflectively
and
that
is
the
black
one
himself
those
who
pass
beyond
the
law
belong
to
him
but
it
would
be
better
to
die
a
thousand
times
than
to
fall
living
into
the
hands
of
the
black
one
barrent
had
long
ago
dismissed
the
religion
of
the
black
one
as
superstitious
nonsense
but
now
listening
to
jay
earnest
voice
he
began
to
wonder
there
might
be
a
difference
between
the
commonplace
worship
of
evil
and
the
actual
presence
of
evil
itself
but
if
you
have
any
luck
jay
said
you
will
be
killed
early
now
i
will
end
the
interview
with
your
final
instructions
still
holding
the
tiny
weapon
jay
reached
into
a
pocket
with
his
free
hand
and
withdrew
a
red
pencil
in
a
quick
practiced
motion
he
drew
the
pencil
over
barrent
cheeks
and
forehead
he
was
finished
before
barrent
had
time
to
recoil
that
marks
you
as
one
of
the
hunted
jay
said
the
are
indelible
here
is
your
needlebeam
he
drew
a
weapon
from
his
pocket
and
put
it
on
the
table
the
hunt
as
i
told
you
begins
at
first
light
of
dawn
anyone
may
kill
you
then
except
another
hunted
man
you
may
kill
in
return
but
i
suggest
that
you
do
so
with
the
utmost
circumspection
the
sound
and
flash
of
needlebeams
have
given
many
hunteds
away
if
you
try
concealment
be
sure
you
have
an
exit
remember
that
others
know
tetrahyde
better
than
you
skilled
hunters
have
explored
all
the
possible
hiding
places
over
the
years
many
of
the
hunted
are
trapped
during
the
first
hours
of
the
holiday
good
luck
citizen
barrent
jay
walked
to
the
door
he
opened
it
and
turned
to
barrent
again
there
is
i
might
add
one
barely
possible
way
of
preserving
both
life
and
liberty
during
the
hunt
but
since
it
is
forbidden
i
can
not
tell
you
what
it
is
norins
jay
bowed
and
went
out
barrent
found
after
repeated
washings
that
the
crimson
on
his
face
were
indeed
indelible
during
the
evening
he
disassembled
the
needlebeam
and
inspected
its
parts
as
he
had
suspected
the
weapon
was
defective
he
discarded
it
in
favor
of
his
own
he
made
his
preparations
for
the
hunt
putting
food
water
a
coil
of
rope
a
knife
extra
ammunition
and
a
spare
needlebeam
into
a
small
knapsack
then
he
waited
hoping
against
all
reason
that
moera
and
her
organization
would
bring
him
a
reprieve
but
no
reprieve
came
an
hour
before
dawn
barrent
shouldered
his
knapsack
and
left
the
antidote
shop
he
had
no
idea
what
the
other
hunteds
were
doing
but
he
had
already
decided
on
a
place
that
might
be
secure
from
the
hunters
chapter
sixteen
authorities
on
omega
agree
that
a
hunted
man
experiences
a
change
of
character
if
he
were
able
to
look
upon
the
hunt
as
an
abstract
problem
he
might
arrive
at
certain
more
or
less
valid
conclusions
but
the
typical
hunted
no
matter
how
great
his
intelligence
can
not
divorce
emotion
from
reasoning
after
all
is
being
hunted
he
becomes
safety
seems
to
lie
in
distance
and
depth
he
goes
as
far
from
home
as
possible
he
goes
deep
into
the
ground
along
the
subterranean
maze
of
sewers
and
conduits
he
chooses
darkness
instead
of
light
empty
places
in
preference
to
crowded
ones
this
behavior
is
well
known
to
experienced
hunters
quite
naturally
they
look
first
in
the
dark
empty
places
in
the
underground
passageways
in
deserted
stores
and
buildings
here
they
find
and
flush
the
hunted
with
inexorable
precision
barrent
had
thought
about
this
he
had
discarded
his
first
instinct
which
was
to
hide
in
the
intricate
tetrahyde
cloaca
instead
an
hour
before
dawn
he
went
directly
to
the
large
brightly
lighted
building
that
housed
the
ministry
of
games
when
the
corridors
seemed
to
be
deserted
he
entered
quickly
read
the
directory
and
climbed
the
stairs
to
the
third
floor
he
passed
a
dozen
office
doors
and
finally
stopped
at
the
one
marked
norins
jay
of
games
he
listened
for
a
moment
then
opened
the
door
and
stepped
in
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
old
jay
reflexes
before
barrent
was
through
the
doorway
the
old
man
had
spotted
the
crimson
on
his
face
jay
opened
a
drawer
and
reached
into
it
barrent
had
no
desire
to
kill
the
old
man
he
flung
the
needlebeam
at
jay
and
caught
him
full
on
the
forehead
jay
staggered
back
against
the
wall
then
collapsed
to
the
floor
bending
over
him
barrent
found
that
his
pulse
was
strong
he
bound
and
gagged
the
and
pushed
him
out
of
sight
under
his
desk
hunting
through
the
drawers
he
found
a
conference
do
not
disturb
sign
he
hung
this
outside
the
door
and
locked
it
with
his
own
needlebeam
drawn
he
sat
down
behind
the
desk
and
awaited
events
dawn
came
and
a
watery
sun
rose
over
omega
from
the
window
barrent
could
see
the
streets
filled
with
people
there
was
a
hectic
carnival
atmosphere
in
the
city
and
the
noise
of
the
holiday
celebration
was
punctuated
by
the
occasional
hiss
of
a
beamer
or
the
flat
explosion
of
a
projectile
weapon
by
noon
barrent
was
still
undetected
he
looked
through
windows
and
found
that
he
had
access
to
the
roof
he
was
glad
to
have
an
exit
just
as
jay
had
suggested
by
jay
had
recovered
consciousness
after
struggling
with
his
bonds
for
a
while
he
lay
quietly
under
the
desk
just
before
evening
someone
knocked
at
the
door
minister
jay
may
i
come
in
not
at
the
moment
barrent
said
in
what
he
hoped
was
a
fair
imitation
of
jay
voice
i
thought
you
be
interested
in
the
statistics
of
the
hunt
the
man
said
so
far
citizens
have
killed
hunteds
with
eighteen
left
to
go
that
quite
an
improvement
over
last
year
yes
it
is
barrent
said
the
percentage
who
hid
in
the
sewer
system
was
larger
this
year
a
few
tried
to
bluff
it
out
by
staying
in
their
homes
we
tracking
down
the
rest
in
the
usual
places
excellent
said
barrent
none
have
made
the
break
so
far
the
man
said
strange
that
hunteds
rarely
think
of
it
but
of
course
it
saves
us
from
having
to
use
the
machines
barrent
wondered
what
the
man
was
talking
about
the
break
where
was
there
to
break
to
and
how
would
machines
be
used
we
already
selecting
alternates
for
the
games
the
man
added
like
to
have
your
approval
of
the
list
use
your
own
judgment
barrent
said
yes
sir
the
man
said
in
a
moment
barrent
heard
his
footsteps
moving
down
the
hall
he
decided
that
the
man
had
become
suspicious
the
conversation
had
lasted
too
long
he
should
have
broken
it
off
earlier
perhaps
he
should
move
to
a
different
office
before
he
could
do
anything
there
was
a
heavy
pounding
at
the
door
yes
citizen
search
committee
a
bass
voice
answered
kindly
open
the
door
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
a
hunted
is
hiding
in
there
nonsense
barrent
said
you
ca
come
in
this
is
a
government
office
we
can
the
bass
voice
said
no
room
office
or
building
is
closed
to
a
citizen
on
hunt
day
are
you
opening
up
barrent
had
already
moved
to
the
window
he
opened
it
and
heard
behind
him
the
sound
of
men
hammering
at
the
door
he
fired
through
the
door
twice
to
give
them
something
to
think
about
then
he
climbed
out
through
the
window
the
rooftops
of
tetrahyde
barrent
saw
at
once
looked
like
a
perfect
place
for
a
hunted
therefore
they
were
the
last
place
a
hunted
should
be
the
maze
of
closely
connected
roofs
chimneys
and
spires
seemed
made
to
order
for
a
chase
but
men
were
already
on
the
roofs
they
shouted
when
they
saw
him
barrent
broke
into
a
sprint
hunters
were
behind
him
and
others
were
closing
in
from
the
sides
he
leaped
a
gap
between
buildings
managed
to
hold
his
balance
on
a
steeply
pitched
roof
and
scrambled
around
the
side
panic
gave
him
speed
he
was
leaving
the
hunters
behind
if
he
could
keep
up
the
pace
for
another
ten
minutes
he
would
have
a
substantial
lead
he
might
be
able
to
leave
the
roofs
and
find
a
better
place
for
concealment
another
gap
between
buildings
came
up
barrent
leaped
it
without
hesitation
he
landed
well
but
his
right
foot
went
completely
through
rotted
shingles
burying
itself
to
the
hip
he
braced
himself
and
pulled
trying
to
extricate
his
leg
but
he
could
get
a
purchase
on
the
steep
crumbling
roof
there
he
is
barrent
wrenched
at
the
shingles
with
both
hands
the
hunters
were
almost
within
needlebeam
distance
by
the
time
he
got
his
leg
out
he
would
be
an
easy
target
he
had
ripped
a
hole
in
the
roof
by
the
time
the
hunters
appeared
on
the
next
building
barrent
pulled
his
leg
free
then
seeing
no
alternative
he
jumped
into
the
hole
for
a
second
he
was
in
the
air
then
he
landed
on
a
table
which
collapsed
under
him
spilling
him
to
the
floor
he
got
up
and
saw
that
he
was
in
a
living
room
an
old
woman
sat
in
a
rocking
chair
less
than
three
feet
away
her
jaw
was
slack
with
terror
she
kept
on
rocking
automatically
barrent
heard
the
hunters
crossing
to
the
roof
he
went
through
the
kitchen
and
out
the
back
door
under
a
tangle
of
clotheslines
and
through
a
small
hedge
someone
fired
at
him
from
a
window
looking
up
he
saw
a
young
boy
trying
to
aim
a
heavy
heat
beamer
his
father
had
probably
forbidden
him
to
hunt
in
the
streets
barrent
turned
into
a
street
and
sprinted
until
he
reached
an
alley
it
looked
familiar
he
realized
that
he
was
in
the
mutant
quarter
not
far
from
myla
house
he
could
hear
the
cries
of
the
hunters
behind
him
he
reached
house
and
found
the
door
unlocked
they
were
all
together
the
man
the
bald
old
woman
and
myla
they
showed
no
surprise
at
his
entrance
so
they
picked
you
in
the
lottery
the
old
man
said
well
it
what
we
expected
barrent
asked
did
myla
skren
it
in
the
water
there
was
no
need
to
the
old
man
said
it
was
quite
predictable
considering
the
sort
of
person
you
are
bold
but
not
ruthless
your
trouble
barrent
the
old
man
had
dropped
the
obligatory
form
of
address
for
a
privileged
citizen
and
that
under
the
circumstances
was
predictable
too
i
seen
it
happen
year
after
year
the
old
man
said
you
be
surprised
how
many
promising
young
men
like
yourself
end
up
in
this
room
out
of
breath
holding
a
needlebeam
as
though
it
weighed
a
ton
with
hunters
three
minutes
behind
them
they
expect
us
to
help
them
but
mutants
like
to
stay
out
of
trouble
shut
up
dem
the
old
woman
said
i
guess
we
have
to
help
you
dem
said
myla
decided
on
it
for
reasons
of
her
own
he
grinned
sardonically
her
mother
and
i
told
her
she
was
wrong
but
she
insisted
and
since
she
the
only
one
of
us
who
can
skren
we
must
let
her
have
her
own
way
myla
said
even
with
us
helping
you
there
very
little
chance
that
you
live
through
the
hunt
if
i
killed
barrent
said
how
will
your
prediction
come
true
remember
you
saw
me
looking
at
my
own
corpse
and
it
was
in
shiny
fragments
i
remember
myla
said
but
your
death
wo
affect
the
prediction
if
it
does
happen
to
you
in
this
lifetime
it
will
simply
catch
up
to
you
in
a
different
incarnation
barrent
was
not
comforted
he
asked
what
should
i
do
the
old
man
handed
him
an
armful
of
rags
put
these
on
and
i
go
to
work
on
your
face
you
my
friend
are
going
to
become
a
mutant
in
a
short
time
barrent
was
back
on
the
street
he
was
dressed
in
rags
beneath
them
he
was
holding
his
needlebeam
and
in
his
free
hand
was
a
begging
cup
the
old
man
had
worked
lavishly
with
a
plastic
barrent
face
was
now
monstrously
swollen
at
the
forehead
and
his
nose
was
flat
and
spread
out
almost
to
the
cheekbones
the
shape
of
his
face
had
been
altered
and
the
livid
were
hidden
a
detachment
of
hunters
raced
past
barely
giving
him
a
glance
barrent
began
to
feel
more
hopeful
he
had
gained
valuable
time
the
last
light
of
omega
watery
sun
was
disappearing
below
the
horizon
night
would
give
him
additional
opportunities
and
with
any
luck
he
could
elude
the
hunters
until
dawn
after
that
were
the
games
of
course
but
barrent
was
planning
on
taking
part
in
them
if
his
disguise
was
good
enough
to
protect
him
from
an
entire
hunting
city
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
be
captured
for
the
games
perhaps
after
the
holiday
was
over
he
could
appear
again
in
omegan
society
quite
possibly
if
he
managed
to
survive
the
hunt
and
altogether
escape
the
games
he
would
be
especially
rewarded
such
a
presumptuous
and
successful
breaking
of
the
law
would
have
to
be
rewarded
he
saw
another
group
of
hunters
coming
toward
him
there
were
five
in
the
group
and
with
them
was
tem
rend
looking
somber
and
proud
in
his
new
assassin
uniform
you
one
of
the
hunters
shouted
have
you
seen
a
quarry
pass
this
way
no
citizen
barrent
said
bowing
his
head
respectfully
his
needlebeam
ready
under
his
rags
do
believe
him
a
man
said
these
damned
mutants
never
tell
us
a
thing
come
on
we
find
him
another
man
said
the
group
moved
away
but
tem
rend
stayed
behind
you
sure
you
have
seen
one
of
the
hunted
go
by
here
rend
asked
positive
citizen
barrent
said
wondering
if
rend
had
recognized
him
he
did
want
to
kill
him
in
fact
he
was
sure
he
could
for
reflexes
were
uncannily
fast
right
now
rend
needlebeam
was
hanging
loosely
from
his
hand
while
barrent
was
already
aimed
that
advantage
might
cancel
out
rend
superior
speed
and
accuracy
but
if
it
came
to
conclusions
barrent
thought
it
would
probably
be
a
tie
in
which
case
they
would
more
than
likely
kill
each
other
well
rend
said
if
you
see
any
of
the
hunted
tell
them
not
to
disguise
themselves
as
mutants
why
not
that
trick
never
works
for
long
rend
said
evenly
it
gives
a
man
about
an
hour
grace
then
the
informers
spot
him
now
if
were
being
hunted
i
might
use
mutant
disguise
but
i
would
just
sit
on
a
curbstone
with
it
i
make
a
break
out
of
tetrahyde
you
would
most
certainly
a
few
hunteds
every
year
escape
into
the
mountains
the
officials
wo
talk
about
it
of
course
and
most
citizens
do
know
but
the
assassin
guild
keeps
complete
records
of
every
trick
device
and
escape
ever
used
it
part
of
our
business
that
very
interesting
barrent
said
he
knew
that
rend
had
seen
through
his
disguise
tem
was
being
a
good
neighbor
though
a
bad
assassin
of
course
rend
said
it
is
easy
to
get
out
of
the
city
and
once
a
man
out
that
does
mean
he
clear
there
are
hunter
patrols
to
watch
out
for
and
even
worse
than
that
rend
stopped
abruptly
a
group
of
hunters
were
coming
toward
them
rend
nodded
pleasantly
and
walked
off
after
the
hunters
had
passed
barrent
got
up
and
started
walking
rend
had
given
him
good
advice
of
course
some
men
would
escape
from
the
city
life
in
omega
barren
mountains
would
be
extremely
difficult
but
any
difficulty
was
better
than
death
if
he
were
able
to
get
by
the
city
gate
he
would
have
to
watch
for
the
hunting
patrols
and
tem
had
mentioned
something
worse
barrent
wondered
what
that
was
special
hunters
perhaps
omega
unstable
climate
deadly
flora
and
fauna
he
wished
rend
had
been
able
to
finish
the
sentence
by
nightfall
he
had
reached
the
south
gate
bent
painfully
over
he
hobbled
toward
the
guard
detachment
that
blocked
his
way
out
chapter
seventeen
there
was
no
trouble
with
the
guards
whole
families
of
mutants
were
streaming
out
of
the
city
seeking
the
protection
of
the
mountains
until
the
frenzy
of
the
hunt
was
over
barrent
attached
himself
to
one
of
these
groups
and
soon
he
found
himself
a
mile
past
tetrahyde
in
the
low
foothills
that
curled
in
a
semicircle
around
the
city
the
mutants
stopped
here
and
made
their
camp
barrent
went
on
and
by
midnight
he
was
starting
up
the
rocky
windswept
slope
of
one
of
the
higher
mountains
he
was
hungry
but
the
cool
clear
air
was
exhilarating
he
began
to
believe
that
he
really
would
live
through
the
hunt
he
heard
a
noisy
group
of
hunters
making
a
sweep
around
the
mountain
he
avoided
them
easily
in
the
darkness
and
continued
climbing
soon
there
was
no
sound
except
the
steady
rush
of
wind
across
the
cliffs
it
was
perhaps
two
in
the
morning
only
three
more
hours
until
dawn
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
it
began
to
rain
lightly
at
first
then
in
a
cold
torrent
this
was
predictable
weather
for
omega
predictable
also
were
the
towering
thunderheads
that
formed
over
the
mountains
the
rolling
thunder
and
the
vivid
yellow
flashes
of
lightning
barrent
found
shelter
in
a
shallow
cave
and
counted
himself
lucky
that
the
temperature
had
not
yet
plunged
he
sat
in
the
cave
the
remnants
of
his
makeup
running
down
his
face
keeping
a
sleepy
watch
over
the
slope
of
the
mountain
below
him
then
in
the
brilliant
illumination
of
a
lightning
flash
he
saw
something
moving
up
the
slope
heading
directly
toward
his
cave
he
stood
up
the
needlebeam
ready
and
waited
for
another
lightning
flash
it
came
and
now
he
could
see
the
cold
wet
gleam
of
metal
a
flashing
of
red
and
green
lights
a
pair
of
metal
tentacles
taking
grips
on
the
rocks
and
small
shrubs
of
the
mountainside
it
was
a
machine
similar
to
the
one
barrent
had
fought
in
the
cellars
of
the
department
of
justice
now
he
knew
what
rend
had
wanted
to
warn
him
about
and
he
could
see
why
few
of
the
hunted
escaped
even
if
they
got
beyond
the
city
itself
this
time
max
would
not
be
operating
at
random
to
make
a
more
equal
contest
out
of
it
and
there
would
be
no
exposed
fuse
box
as
max
came
within
range
barrent
fired
the
blast
bounced
harmlessly
off
the
machine
armored
hide
barrent
left
the
shelter
of
his
cave
and
began
to
climb
the
machine
came
steadily
behind
him
up
the
treacherous
wet
face
of
the
mountain
barrent
tried
to
lose
it
on
a
plateau
of
jagged
boulders
but
max
could
be
shaken
barrent
realized
that
the
machine
must
be
following
a
scent
of
some
kind
probably
it
was
keyed
to
follow
the
indelible
paint
on
barrent
face
on
a
steep
face
of
the
mountain
barrent
rolled
boulders
onto
the
machine
hoping
he
could
start
an
avalanche
max
dodged
most
of
the
flying
rocks
and
let
the
rest
bounce
off
him
with
no
visible
effect
at
last
barrent
was
backed
into
a
narrow
angle
of
cliff
he
was
unable
to
climb
any
higher
he
waited
when
the
machine
loomed
over
him
he
held
the
needlebeam
against
its
metal
hide
and
held
down
the
trigger
max
shuddered
for
a
moment
under
the
impact
of
the
needlebeam
full
charge
then
it
brushed
the
weapon
away
and
wrapped
a
tentacle
around
barrent
neck
the
metal
coils
tightened
barrent
felt
himself
losing
consciousness
he
had
time
to
wonder
whether
the
coils
would
strangle
him
or
break
his
neck
suddenly
the
pressure
was
gone
the
machine
had
backed
away
a
few
feet
past
it
barrent
could
see
the
first
gray
light
of
dawn
he
had
lived
through
the
hunt
the
machine
was
not
programmed
to
kill
him
after
dawn
but
it
would
let
him
go
it
kept
him
captive
in
the
narrow
angle
of
the
cliff
until
the
hunters
came
they
brought
barrent
back
to
tetrahyde
where
a
wildly
applauding
crowd
gave
him
a
hero
welcome
after
a
procession
barrent
and
four
other
survivors
were
taken
to
the
office
of
the
awards
committee
the
chairman
made
a
short
and
moving
speech
about
the
skill
and
courage
each
had
shown
in
surviving
the
hunt
he
gave
each
of
them
the
rank
of
hadji
and
presented
them
with
the
tiny
golden
earrings
which
showed
their
status
at
the
end
of
the
ceremony
the
chairman
wished
each
of
the
new
hadjis
an
easy
death
in
the
games
chapter
eighteen
guards
led
barrent
from
the
office
of
the
awards
committee
he
was
brought
past
a
row
of
dungeons
under
the
arena
and
locked
into
a
cell
the
guards
told
him
to
be
patient
the
games
had
already
begun
and
his
turn
would
come
soon
there
were
nine
men
crammed
into
a
cell
which
had
been
built
to
hold
three
most
of
them
sat
or
sprawled
in
complete
and
silent
apathy
already
resigned
to
their
deaths
but
one
of
them
was
definitely
not
resigned
he
pushed
his
way
to
the
front
of
the
cell
as
barrent
entered
joe
the
little
credit
thief
grinned
at
him
a
sad
place
to
meet
will
what
happened
to
you
politics
joe
said
it
a
dangerous
business
on
omega
especially
during
the
time
of
the
games
i
thought
i
was
safe
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
was
selected
for
the
games
this
morning
is
there
any
chance
of
getting
out
of
it
there
a
chance
joe
said
i
told
your
girl
about
you
so
perhaps
her
friends
can
do
something
as
for
me
i
expecting
a
reprieve
is
that
possible
barrent
asked
anything
is
possible
it
better
not
to
hope
for
it
though
what
are
the
games
like
barrent
asked
they
the
sort
of
thing
you
expect
joe
said
combats
battles
against
various
types
of
omegan
flora
and
fauna
needlebeam
and
heatgun
duels
it
all
copied
from
an
old
earth
festival
i
told
and
if
anyone
survives
barrent
said
they
beyond
the
law
that
right
but
what
does
it
mean
to
be
beyond
the
law
i
do
know
joe
said
nobody
seems
to
know
much
about
that
all
i
could
find
out
is
survivors
of
the
games
are
taken
by
the
black
one
it
not
supposed
to
be
pleasant
i
can
understand
that
very
little
on
omega
pleasant
it
is
a
bad
place
joe
said
you
just
have
the
proper
spirit
of
he
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
a
detachment
of
guards
it
was
time
for
the
occupants
of
barrent
cell
to
enter
the
arena
no
reprieve
barrent
said
well
that
how
it
goes
joe
said
they
were
marched
out
under
heavy
guard
and
lined
up
at
the
iron
door
that
separated
the
cell
block
from
the
main
arena
just
before
the
captain
of
the
guards
opened
the
door
a
fat
man
came
hurrying
down
a
side
corridor
waving
a
paper
what
this
the
captain
of
the
guards
asked
a
writ
of
recognizance
the
fat
man
said
handing
his
paper
to
the
captain
on
the
other
side
you
find
a
order
he
pulled
more
papers
out
of
his
pockets
and
here
is
a
notice
a
chattel
mortgage
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
a
salary
attachment
the
captain
pushed
back
his
helmet
and
scratched
his
narrow
forehead
i
can
never
understand
what
you
lawyers
are
talking
about
what
does
it
mean
it
releases
him
the
fat
man
said
pointing
to
joe
the
captain
took
the
papers
gave
them
a
single
puzzled
glance
and
handed
them
to
an
aide
all
right
he
said
take
him
with
you
but
it
was
like
this
in
the
old
days
stopped
the
orderly
progression
of
the
games
grinning
triumphantly
joe
stepped
through
the
ranks
of
guards
and
joined
the
fat
lawyer
he
asked
him
do
you
have
any
papers
for
will
barrent
none
the
lawyer
said
his
case
is
in
different
hands
i
afraid
it
might
not
be
completely
processed
until
after
the
games
are
over
but
i
probably
be
dead
then
barrent
said
that
i
can
assure
you
wo
stop
the
papers
from
being
properly
served
the
fat
lawyer
said
proudly
dead
or
alive
you
will
retain
all
your
rights
the
captain
of
the
guards
said
all
right
let
go
luck
joe
called
out
and
then
the
line
of
prisoners
had
passed
through
the
iron
door
into
the
glaring
light
of
the
arena
barrent
lived
through
the
duels
in
which
a
quarter
of
the
prisoners
were
killed
after
that
men
armed
with
swords
were
matched
against
the
deadlier
omegan
fauna
the
beasts
they
fought
included
the
hintolyte
and
the
hintosced
heavily
armored
monsters
whose
natural
habitat
was
the
desert
region
far
to
the
south
of
tetrahyde
fifteen
men
later
these
beasts
were
dead
barrent
was
matched
with
a
saunus
a
flying
black
reptile
from
the
western
mountains
for
a
while
he
was
by
this
ugly
creature
but
in
time
he
figured
out
a
solution
he
stopped
trying
to
jab
the
leathery
hide
and
concentrated
on
severing
its
broad
fan
of
tailfeathers
when
he
had
succeeded
the
saunus
flying
balance
was
thrown
badly
off
the
reptile
crashed
into
the
high
wall
that
separated
the
combatants
from
the
spectators
and
it
was
relatively
easy
to
administer
the
final
stroke
through
the
saunus
single
huge
eye
the
vast
and
enthusiastic
crowd
in
the
stadium
gave
barrent
a
lengthy
round
of
applause
he
moved
back
to
the
reserve
pen
and
watched
other
men
struggle
against
the
trichomotreds
incredibly
fast
little
creatures
the
size
of
rats
with
the
dispositions
of
rabid
wolverines
it
took
five
teams
of
prisoners
after
a
brief
interlude
of
duelling
the
arena
was
cleared
again
now
the
criatin
amphibians
lumbered
in
although
sluggish
in
disposition
the
criatins
were
completely
protected
beneath
several
inches
of
shell
their
narrow
whiplash
tails
which
also
served
them
as
antennae
were
invariably
fatal
to
any
man
who
approached
them
barrent
had
to
fight
one
of
these
after
it
had
dispatched
four
of
his
fellow
prisoners
he
had
watched
the
earlier
combats
carefully
and
had
detected
the
one
place
where
the
criatin
antennae
could
not
reach
barrent
waited
for
his
chance
and
jumped
for
the
center
of
the
criatin
broad
back
when
the
shell
split
into
a
gigantic
mouth
for
this
was
the
criatin
method
of
feeding
barrent
jammed
his
sword
into
the
opening
the
criatin
expired
with
gratifying
promptness
and
the
crowd
signified
its
approval
by
showering
the
arena
with
cushions
the
victory
left
barrent
standing
alone
on
the
sand
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
were
either
dead
or
too
badly
maimed
to
fight
barrent
waited
wondering
what
beast
the
games
committee
had
chosen
next
a
single
tendril
shot
up
through
the
sand
and
then
another
within
seconds
a
short
thick
tree
was
growing
in
the
arena
sending
out
more
roots
and
tendrils
and
pulling
all
flesh
living
or
dead
into
five
small
which
circled
the
base
of
the
trunk
this
was
the
carrion
tree
indigenous
to
the
northeastern
swamps
and
imported
with
great
difficulty
it
was
said
to
be
highly
vulnerable
to
fire
but
barrent
had
no
fire
available
using
his
sword
barrent
lopped
off
vines
others
grew
in
their
place
he
worked
with
frantic
speed
to
keep
the
vines
from
surrounding
him
his
arms
were
becoming
tired
and
the
tree
regenerated
faster
than
he
could
cut
it
down
there
seemed
no
way
of
destroying
it
his
only
hope
lay
in
the
tree
slow
movements
these
were
fast
enough
but
nothing
compared
with
human
musculature
barrent
ducked
out
of
a
corner
in
which
the
creeping
vines
were
trapping
him
another
sword
was
lying
twenty
yards
away
in
the
sand
barrent
reached
it
and
heard
warning
shouts
from
the
crowd
he
felt
a
vine
close
around
his
ankles
he
hacked
at
it
and
other
vines
coiled
around
his
waist
he
dug
his
heels
into
the
sand
and
clashed
the
swords
together
trying
to
produce
a
spark
on
his
first
try
the
sword
in
his
right
hand
broke
in
half
barrent
picked
up
the
halves
and
kept
on
trying
as
the
vines
dragged
him
closer
to
the
feeding
mouths
a
shower
of
sparks
flew
from
the
clanging
steel
one
of
them
touched
a
vine
with
incredible
suddenness
the
vine
burst
into
flame
the
flame
spurted
down
the
length
of
the
vine
to
the
main
tree
system
the
five
mouths
moaned
as
the
fire
leaped
toward
them
if
matters
had
been
left
to
continue
barrent
would
have
been
burned
to
death
for
the
arena
was
nearly
filled
with
the
highly
combustible
vines
but
the
flames
were
endangering
the
wooden
walls
of
the
arena
the
tetrahyde
guard
detachment
put
the
fire
out
in
time
to
save
both
barrent
and
the
spectators
swaying
with
exhaustion
barrent
stood
in
the
center
of
the
arena
wondering
what
would
be
used
next
against
him
but
nothing
happened
after
a
moment
a
signal
was
made
from
the
president
box
and
the
crowd
roared
in
applause
the
games
were
over
barrent
had
survived
still
no
one
left
his
seat
the
audience
was
waiting
to
see
the
final
disposition
of
barrent
who
had
passed
beyond
the
law
he
heard
a
low
reverent
gasp
from
the
crowd
turning
quickly
barrent
saw
a
fiery
dot
of
light
appear
in
it
swelled
threw
out
streamers
of
light
and
gathered
them
in
again
it
grew
rapidly
too
brilliant
to
look
upon
and
barrent
remembered
uncle
ingemar
saying
to
him
sometimes
the
black
one
rewards
us
by
appearing
in
the
awful
beauty
of
his
fiery
flesh
yes
nephew
i
have
actually
been
privileged
to
see
him
two
years
ago
he
appeared
at
the
games
and
he
also
appeared
the
year
before
that
the
dot
became
a
red
and
yellow
globe
about
twenty
feet
in
diameter
its
lowest
curve
not
quite
touching
the
ground
it
grew
again
the
center
of
the
globe
became
thinner
a
waist
appeared
and
above
the
waist
the
globe
turned
an
impenetrable
black
it
was
two
globes
now
one
brilliant
one
dark
joined
by
a
narrow
waist
as
barrent
watched
the
dark
globe
lengthened
and
changed
into
the
unforgettable
shape
of
the
dark
one
barrent
tried
to
run
but
the
huge
figure
swept
forward
and
engulfed
him
he
was
trapped
in
a
blinding
swirl
of
radiance
with
darkness
above
it
the
light
bored
into
his
head
and
he
tried
to
scream
then
he
passed
out
chapter
nineteen
barrent
recovered
consciousness
in
a
dim
room
he
was
lying
on
a
bed
two
people
were
standing
near
by
they
seemed
to
be
arguing
there
simply
is
any
more
time
to
wait
a
man
was
saying
you
fail
to
appreciate
the
urgency
of
the
situation
the
doctor
said
he
needs
at
least
another
three
days
of
rest
it
was
a
woman
voice
after
a
moment
barrent
realized
that
moera
was
speaking
he
can
have
three
days
and
he
needs
time
for
indoctrination
you
told
me
he
was
bright
the
indoctrination
should
take
long
it
might
take
weeks
impossible
the
ship
lands
in
six
days
eylan
moera
said
you
trying
to
move
too
fast
we
ca
do
it
this
time
on
the
next
landing
day
we
will
be
much
better
prepared
the
situation
will
be
out
of
hand
by
then
the
man
said
i
sorry
moera
we
have
to
use
barrent
immediately
or
not
use
him
at
all
barrent
said
use
me
for
what
where
am
i
who
are
you
the
man
turned
to
the
bed
in
the
faint
light
barrent
saw
a
very
tall
thin
stooped
old
man
with
a
wispy
moustache
i
glad
you
awake
he
said
my
name
is
swen
eylan
i
in
command
of
group
two
what
group
two
barrent
asked
how
did
you
get
me
out
of
the
arena
are
you
agents
of
the
black
one
eylan
grinned
not
exactly
agents
we
explain
everything
to
you
shortly
first
i
think
you
better
have
something
to
eat
and
drink
a
nurse
brought
in
a
tray
while
barrent
ate
eylan
pulled
up
a
chair
and
told
barrent
about
the
black
one
our
group
eylan
said
ca
claim
to
have
started
the
religion
of
evil
that
appears
to
have
sprung
up
spontaneously
on
omega
but
since
it
was
there
we
have
made
occasional
use
of
it
the
priests
have
been
remarkably
cooperative
after
all
the
worshipers
of
evil
set
a
high
positive
value
upon
corruption
therefore
in
the
eyes
of
an
omegan
priest
the
appearance
of
a
fraudulent
black
one
is
not
anathema
quite
the
contrary
for
in
the
orthodox
worship
of
evil
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
is
put
upon
false
images
especially
if
they
are
big
fiery
impressive
images
like
the
one
which
rescued
you
from
the
arena
how
did
you
produce
that
barrent
asked
it
has
to
do
with
friction
surfaces
and
planes
of
force
eylan
said
you
have
to
ask
our
engineers
for
more
details
why
did
you
rescue
me
barrent
asked
eylan
glanced
at
moera
who
shrugged
her
shoulders
looking
uncomfortable
eylan
said
we
like
to
use
you
for
an
important
job
but
before
i
tell
you
about
it
i
think
you
should
know
something
about
our
organization
certainly
you
must
have
some
curiosity
about
us
a
great
deal
barrent
said
are
you
some
kind
of
criminal
elite
we
an
elite
eylan
said
but
we
do
consider
ourselves
criminal
two
entirely
different
types
of
people
have
been
sent
to
omega
there
are
the
true
criminals
guilty
of
murder
arson
armed
robbery
and
the
like
those
are
the
people
you
lived
among
and
there
are
the
people
guilty
of
deviational
crimes
such
as
political
unreliability
scientific
unorthodoxy
and
irreligious
attitudes
these
people
compose
our
organization
which
for
the
purposes
of
identification
we
call
group
two
as
far
as
we
can
remember
and
reconstruct
our
crimes
were
largely
a
matter
of
holding
different
opinions
from
those
which
prevailed
upon
earth
we
were
nonconformists
we
probably
constituted
an
unstable
element
and
a
threat
to
the
entrenched
powers
therefore
we
were
deported
to
omega
and
you
separated
yourselves
from
the
other
deportees
barrent
said
yes
necessarily
for
one
thing
the
true
criminals
of
group
one
are
not
readily
controllable
we
could
lead
them
nor
could
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
led
by
them
but
more
important
than
that
we
had
a
job
to
do
that
could
only
be
performed
in
secrecy
we
had
no
idea
what
devices
the
guardships
employed
to
watch
the
surface
of
omega
to
keep
our
security
intact
we
went
underground
literally
the
room
you
in
now
is
about
two
hundred
feet
below
the
surface
we
stay
out
of
sight
except
for
special
agents
like
moera
who
separate
the
political
and
social
prisoners
who
belong
in
group
two
from
the
others
you
did
separate
me
barrent
said
of
course
not
you
were
allegedly
guilty
of
murder
which
put
you
in
group
one
however
your
behavior
was
not
typical
of
group
one
you
seemed
like
good
potential
material
for
us
so
we
helped
you
from
time
to
time
but
we
had
to
be
sure
of
you
before
taking
you
into
the
group
your
repudiation
of
the
murder
charge
was
strongly
in
your
favor
also
we
questioned
illiardi
after
you
had
located
him
there
seemed
no
reason
to
doubt
that
he
performed
the
murder
you
were
charged
with
even
more
strongly
in
your
favor
were
your
high
survival
qualities
which
had
their
ultimate
test
in
the
hunt
and
the
games
we
were
badly
in
need
of
a
man
of
your
abilities
just
what
is
your
work
barrent
asked
what
do
you
want
to
accomplish
we
want
to
go
back
to
earth
eylan
said
but
that
impossible
we
do
think
so
eylan
said
we
given
the
matter
considerable
study
in
spite
of
the
guardships
we
think
it
possible
to
return
to
earth
we
find
out
for
certain
in
six
days
when
the
breakout
must
be
made
moera
said
it
would
be
better
to
wait
another
six
months
impossible
a
six
months
delay
would
be
ruinous
every
society
has
a
purpose
and
the
criminal
population
of
omega
is
bent
upon
its
own
barrent
you
look
surprised
could
you
see
that
i
never
thought
about
it
barrent
said
after
all
i
was
part
of
it
it
eylan
said
consider
the
institutions
all
centered
around
legalized
murder
the
holidays
are
excuses
for
mass
murders
even
the
law
which
governs
the
rate
of
murder
is
beginning
to
break
down
the
population
lives
near
the
edge
of
chaos
and
rightfully
so
there
no
longer
any
security
the
only
way
to
live
is
to
kill
the
only
way
to
rise
in
status
is
to
kill
the
only
safe
thing
is
to
kill
more
and
more
faster
and
faster
you
exaggerate
moera
said
i
do
think
so
i
realize
that
there
seems
to
be
a
certain
permanence
to
omegan
institutions
a
certain
inherent
conservatism
even
to
murder
but
it
an
illusion
i
have
no
doubt
that
all
dying
societies
projected
their
illusion
of
permanence
right
up
to
the
end
well
the
end
of
omegan
society
is
rapidly
approaching
how
soon
barrent
asked
an
explosion
point
will
be
reached
in
about
four
months
eylan
said
the
only
way
to
change
that
would
be
to
give
the
population
a
new
direction
a
different
cause
earth
barrent
said
exactly
that
why
the
attempt
must
be
made
immediately
well
i
do
know
much
about
it
barrent
said
but
i
go
along
with
you
i
gladly
be
a
part
of
any
expedition
eylan
looked
uncomfortable
again
i
suppose
i
have
made
myself
clear
he
said
are
going
to
be
the
expedition
barrent
you
and
only
you
forgive
me
if
i
startled
you
chapter
twenty
according
to
eylan
group
two
had
at
least
one
serious
flaw
the
men
who
composed
it
were
for
the
most
part
past
their
physical
prime
there
were
some
younger
members
of
course
but
they
had
had
little
contact
with
violence
and
little
chance
to
develop
traits
of
secure
in
the
underground
most
of
them
had
never
fired
a
beamer
in
anger
had
never
been
forced
to
run
for
their
lives
had
never
encountered
the
situations
through
which
barrent
had
lived
they
were
brave
but
unproven
they
would
willingly
undertake
the
expedition
to
earth
but
they
would
have
little
chance
of
success
and
you
think
i
would
have
a
chance
barrent
asked
i
think
so
you
young
and
strong
reasonably
intelligent
and
extremely
resourceful
you
have
a
high
survival
quotient
if
any
man
could
succeed
i
believe
you
could
why
one
man
because
there
no
sense
in
sending
a
group
the
chance
of
detection
would
simply
be
increased
by
using
one
man
we
get
maximum
security
and
opportunity
if
you
succeed
we
will
receive
valuable
information
about
the
nature
of
the
enemy
if
you
do
succeed
if
you
are
captured
your
attempt
will
be
considered
the
action
of
an
individual
rather
than
a
group
we
will
still
be
free
to
start
a
general
uprising
from
omega
how
am
i
supposed
to
get
back
to
earth
barrent
asked
do
you
have
a
starship
hidden
away
somewhere
i
afraid
not
we
plan
to
transport
you
to
earth
aboard
the
next
prison
ship
that
impossible
not
at
all
we
studied
the
landings
they
follow
a
pattern
the
prisoners
are
marched
out
accompanied
by
the
guards
while
assembled
in
the
square
the
ship
itself
is
undefended
although
loosely
surrounded
by
a
cordon
of
guards
to
get
you
aboard
we
will
start
a
disturbance
it
should
take
away
the
guards
attention
long
enough
for
you
to
get
on
board
even
if
i
succeed
i
be
captured
as
soon
as
the
guards
return
you
should
be
eylan
said
the
prison
ship
is
an
immense
structure
with
many
hiding
places
for
a
stowaway
and
the
element
of
surprise
will
be
in
your
favor
this
may
be
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
omega
that
an
escape
has
been
attempted
and
when
the
ship
reaches
earth
you
will
be
disguised
as
a
member
of
the
ship
personnel
eylan
said
remember
the
inevitable
inefficiency
of
a
huge
bureaucracy
will
be
working
for
you
i
hope
so
barrent
said
let
suppose
i
reach
earth
safely
and
get
the
information
you
want
how
do
i
send
it
back
you
send
it
back
on
the
next
prison
ship
eylan
said
we
plan
to
capture
that
one
barrent
rubbed
his
forehead
wearily
what
makes
you
think
that
any
of
this
my
expedition
or
your
uprising
can
succeed
against
an
organization
as
powerful
as
earth
we
have
to
take
the
chance
eylan
said
take
it
or
go
down
in
a
bloody
shambles
with
the
rest
of
omega
i
agree
that
the
odds
are
weighted
against
us
but
our
choice
is
either
to
make
the
attempt
or
to
die
without
making
any
attempt
at
all
moera
nodded
at
this
also
the
situation
has
other
possibilities
the
government
of
earth
is
obviously
repressive
that
argues
the
existence
of
underground
resistance
groups
on
earth
itself
you
may
be
able
to
contact
those
groups
a
revolt
both
here
on
earth
would
give
the
government
something
to
think
about
maybe
barrent
said
we
have
to
hope
for
the
best
eylan
said
are
you
with
us
certainly
barrent
said
i
rather
die
on
earth
than
on
omega
the
prison
ship
lands
in
six
days
eylan
said
during
that
time
we
will
give
you
the
information
we
have
about
earth
part
of
it
is
memory
reconstruction
part
has
been
skrenned
by
the
mutants
and
the
rest
is
logical
constructs
it
all
we
have
and
i
think
it
gives
a
reasonably
accurate
picture
of
current
conditions
on
earth
how
soon
do
we
start
barrent
asked
right
now
eylan
said
barrent
received
a
general
briefing
on
the
physical
of
earth
its
climate
and
major
population
centers
then
he
was
sent
to
colonel
bray
formerly
of
the
earth
deep
space
establishment
bray
talked
to
him
about
the
probable
military
strength
of
earth
as
represented
by
the
number
of
guardships
around
omega
and
their
apparent
level
of
scientific
development
he
gave
estimates
of
the
size
of
the
earth
forces
their
probable
divisions
into
land
sea
and
space
groups
their
assumed
level
of
efficiency
an
aide
captain
carell
lectured
on
special
weapons
their
probable
types
and
ranges
their
availability
to
the
general
earth
population
another
aide
lieutenant
daoud
talked
about
detection
devices
their
probable
locations
and
how
to
avoid
them
then
barrent
was
turned
back
to
eylan
for
political
indoctrination
from
him
barrent
learned
that
earth
was
believed
to
be
a
dictatorship
he
learned
the
methods
of
a
dictatorship
its
peculiar
strengths
and
weaknesses
the
role
of
the
secret
police
the
use
of
terror
the
problem
of
informers
when
eylan
was
finished
with
him
barrent
went
to
a
small
man
who
lectured
on
earth
system
using
the
premise
that
was
regularly
employed
to
render
opposition
ineffective
the
man
went
on
to
construct
the
probable
nature
of
an
underground
movement
on
earth
given
those
circumstances
and
how
barrent
might
contact
them
and
what
the
underground
capabilities
might
be
finally
he
was
given
the
full
details
of
group
two
plan
for
getting
him
on
board
the
ship
when
landing
day
came
barrent
felt
a
definite
sense
of
relief
he
was
heartily
sick
of
day
and
night
cramming
any
sort
of
action
would
seem
an
improvement
chapter
barrent
watched
the
huge
prison
ship
maneuver
into
position
and
sink
noiselessly
to
the
ground
it
gleamed
dully
in
the
afternoon
sun
tangible
proof
of
earth
long
reach
and
powerful
grasp
a
hatch
opened
and
a
landing
stage
was
let
down
the
prisoners
flanked
by
guards
marched
down
and
assembled
in
the
square
as
usual
most
of
the
population
of
tetrahyde
had
gathered
to
watch
and
cheer
the
disembarkation
ceremony
barrent
moved
through
the
crowd
and
stationed
himself
behind
the
ranks
of
prisoners
and
guards
he
touched
his
pocket
to
make
sure
the
needlebeam
was
still
there
it
had
been
made
for
him
by
group
two
fabricators
completely
of
plastic
to
escape
any
metals
detector
the
rest
of
his
pockets
were
stuffed
with
equipment
he
hoped
he
would
have
to
use
any
of
it
the
loudspeaker
voice
began
to
read
off
the
prisoners
numbers
as
it
had
when
barrent
had
disembarked
he
listened
knees
slightly
bent
waiting
for
the
beginning
of
the
diversion
the
loudspeaker
voice
was
coming
to
the
end
of
the
prisoner
list
there
were
only
ten
left
barrent
edged
forward
the
voice
droned
on
four
prisoners
left
three
as
the
number
of
the
last
prisoner
was
announced
the
diversion
began
a
black
cloud
of
smoke
darkened
the
pale
sky
and
barrent
knew
that
the
group
had
set
fire
to
the
empty
barracks
in
square
he
waited
then
it
came
there
was
a
stupendous
explosion
blasting
through
two
rows
of
empty
buildings
the
shock
wave
was
staggering
even
before
debris
began
to
fall
barrent
was
running
toward
the
ship
the
second
and
third
explosions
went
off
as
he
came
into
the
shadow
quickly
he
stripped
off
his
omegan
outer
garments
under
them
he
wore
a
facsimile
of
guard
uniform
now
he
ran
toward
the
landing
stage
the
loudspeaker
voice
was
calling
loudly
for
order
the
guards
were
still
bewildered
the
fourth
explosion
threw
barrent
to
the
ground
he
got
to
his
feet
instantly
and
sprinted
up
the
landing
stage
he
was
inside
the
ship
outside
he
could
hear
the
guard
captain
shouting
orders
the
guards
were
beginning
to
form
into
ranks
their
weapons
ready
to
use
against
the
restive
crowd
they
were
retreating
to
the
ship
in
good
order
barrent
had
no
more
time
to
listen
he
was
standing
in
a
long
narrow
corridor
he
turned
to
the
right
and
raced
toward
the
bow
of
the
ship
far
behind
him
he
could
hear
the
heavy
marching
tread
of
the
guards
now
he
thought
the
information
he
had
been
given
about
the
ship
had
better
be
right
or
the
expedition
was
finished
before
it
began
he
sprinted
past
rows
of
empty
cells
and
came
to
a
door
marked
guard
assembly
room
a
lighted
green
bulb
above
the
door
showed
that
the
air
system
was
on
he
went
by
it
and
came
to
another
door
barrent
tried
it
now
and
found
it
unlocked
within
was
a
room
stacked
high
with
spare
engine
parts
he
entered
and
closed
the
door
the
guards
marched
down
the
corridor
barrent
could
hear
them
talking
as
they
entered
the
assembly
room
what
do
you
think
started
those
explosions
who
knows
those
prisoners
are
crazy
anyhow
they
blow
up
the
whole
planet
if
they
could
good
riddance
well
it
did
cause
any
damage
there
was
an
explosion
like
that
about
fifteen
years
ago
remember
i
was
here
then
well
it
was
worse
than
this
two
guards
were
killed
and
maybe
a
hundred
prisoners
what
started
it
do
know
these
omegans
just
enjoy
blowing
things
up
next
thing
you
know
they
be
trying
to
blow
up
not
a
chance
not
with
the
guardships
up
there
you
think
so
well
i
be
glad
to
get
back
to
the
checkpoint
you
said
it
be
good
to
get
off
this
ship
and
live
a
little
it
is
a
bad
life
at
the
checkpoint
but
i
rather
go
back
to
earth
well
you
ca
have
everything
the
last
of
the
guards
entered
the
assembly
room
and
dogged
the
door
shut
barrent
waited
after
a
while
he
felt
the
ship
vibrate
it
was
beginning
its
departure
he
had
learned
some
valuable
information
apparently
all
or
most
of
the
guards
got
off
at
the
checkpoint
did
that
mean
that
another
detachment
of
guards
got
on
probably
and
a
checkpoint
implied
that
the
ship
was
searched
for
escaped
prisoners
it
was
probably
only
a
perfunctory
search
since
no
prisoner
had
escaped
in
the
history
of
omega
still
he
would
have
to
figure
out
a
way
of
avoiding
it
but
he
would
face
that
when
the
time
came
now
he
felt
the
vibration
cease
and
he
knew
that
the
ship
had
left
the
surface
of
omega
he
was
aboard
unobserved
and
the
ship
was
on
its
way
to
earth
so
far
everything
had
gone
according
to
plan
for
the
next
few
hours
barrent
stayed
in
the
storage
room
he
was
feeling
very
tired
and
his
joints
had
begun
to
ache
the
air
in
the
small
room
had
a
sour
exhausted
smell
forcing
himself
to
his
feet
barrent
walked
to
the
air
vent
and
put
his
hand
over
it
no
air
was
coming
through
he
took
a
small
gauge
out
of
his
pocket
the
oxygen
content
of
the
room
was
falling
rapidly
cautiously
he
opened
the
storeroom
door
and
peered
out
although
he
was
dressed
in
a
perfect
replica
of
guard
uniform
he
knew
he
pass
among
men
who
knew
each
other
so
well
he
had
to
stay
in
hiding
and
he
had
to
have
air
the
corridors
were
deserted
he
passed
the
guard
assembly
room
and
heard
faint
murmurs
of
conversation
inside
the
green
light
glowed
brightly
over
the
door
barrent
walked
on
beginning
to
feel
the
first
signs
of
dizziness
his
gauge
showed
him
that
the
oxygen
content
in
the
corridor
was
starting
to
fall
the
group
had
assumed
that
the
air
system
would
be
used
throughout
the
ship
now
barrent
could
see
that
with
only
guards
and
crew
aboard
there
was
no
need
to
supply
air
for
the
entire
ship
there
would
be
air
in
the
little
islands
of
the
guardroom
and
the
section
and
nowhere
else
barrent
hurried
down
the
dim
silent
corridors
gasping
for
breath
the
air
was
rapidly
growing
bad
perhaps
it
was
being
used
in
the
assembly
room
before
the
ship
main
air
supply
was
touched
he
passed
unlocked
doors
but
the
green
bulbs
above
them
were
unlighted
he
had
a
pounding
headache
and
his
legs
felt
as
if
they
were
turning
to
jelly
he
tried
to
figure
out
a
course
of
action
the
crew
section
seemed
to
offer
him
the
best
chance
ship
personnel
might
not
be
armed
even
if
they
were
they
would
be
less
ready
for
trouble
than
the
guards
perhaps
he
could
hold
one
of
the
officers
at
gunpoint
perhaps
he
could
take
over
the
ship
it
was
worth
trying
it
had
to
be
tried
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
he
came
to
a
staircase
he
climbed
past
a
dozen
deserted
levels
and
came
at
last
to
a
stenciled
sign
on
one
of
the
walls
it
read
control
section
and
an
arrow
pointed
the
way
barrent
took
the
plastic
needlebeam
out
of
his
pocket
and
staggered
down
the
corridor
he
was
beginning
to
lose
consciousness
black
shadows
formed
and
dissipated
on
the
edges
of
his
vision
he
was
experiencing
vague
hallucinations
flashes
of
horror
in
which
he
felt
the
corridor
walls
falling
in
on
him
he
found
that
he
was
on
his
hands
and
knees
crawling
toward
a
door
marked
control
room
admittance
except
to
ship
the
corridor
seemed
to
be
filled
with
gray
fog
it
cleared
momentarily
and
barrent
realized
that
his
eyes
were
not
focusing
properly
he
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
and
turned
the
door
handle
it
began
to
open
he
took
a
firm
grip
on
the
needlebeam
and
tried
to
prepare
himself
for
action
but
as
the
door
opened
darkness
closed
irrevocably
around
him
he
thought
he
could
see
startled
faces
hear
a
voice
shouting
watch
out
he
armed
and
then
the
blackness
closed
in
completely
and
he
fell
endlessly
forward
chapter
barrent
return
to
consciousness
was
sudden
and
complete
he
sat
up
and
saw
that
he
had
fallen
inside
the
control
room
the
metal
door
was
closed
behind
him
and
he
was
breathing
without
difficulty
he
could
see
no
sign
of
the
crew
they
must
have
gone
after
the
guards
assuming
he
would
stay
unconscious
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
instinctively
picking
up
his
needlebeam
he
examined
the
weapon
closely
then
frowned
and
put
it
away
why
he
wondered
would
the
crew
leave
him
alone
in
the
control
room
the
most
important
part
of
the
ship
why
would
they
leave
him
armed
he
tried
to
remember
the
faces
he
had
seen
just
before
he
collapsed
they
were
indistinct
memories
vague
and
unfocused
figures
with
hollow
dreamlike
voices
had
there
really
been
people
in
here
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
certain
he
was
that
he
had
conjured
those
people
out
of
his
fading
consciousness
there
had
been
no
one
here
he
was
alone
in
the
ship
nerve
center
he
approached
the
main
control
board
it
was
divided
into
ten
stations
each
section
had
its
rows
of
dials
whose
slender
indicators
pointed
to
incomprehensible
readings
each
had
its
switches
wheels
rheostats
and
levers
barrent
walked
slowly
past
the
stations
watching
the
patterns
of
flashing
lights
that
ran
to
the
ceiling
and
rippled
along
the
walls
the
last
station
seemed
to
be
some
kind
of
overall
control
for
the
rest
a
small
screen
was
marked
the
part
was
lighted
there
were
similar
screens
for
navigation
lookout
collision
control
subspace
entry
and
exit
normal
space
entry
and
exit
and
landing
all
were
automatic
further
on
he
found
the
programming
screen
which
clicked
off
the
progress
of
the
flight
in
hours
minutes
and
seconds
time
to
checkpoint
one
was
now
hours
minutes
seconds
time
three
hours
time
from
checkpoint
to
earth
hours
the
control
board
flashed
and
hummed
to
itself
serene
and
barrent
could
help
feeling
that
the
presence
of
a
human
in
this
temple
of
the
machine
was
sacrilege
he
checked
the
air
ducts
they
were
set
for
automatic
feed
giving
just
enough
air
to
support
the
room
present
human
population
of
one
but
where
was
the
crew
barrent
could
understand
the
necessity
of
operating
a
starship
largely
on
an
automatic
programming
system
a
structure
as
huge
and
complex
as
this
had
to
be
but
men
had
built
it
and
men
had
punched
out
the
programs
why
were
men
present
to
monitor
the
switchboards
to
modify
the
program
when
necessary
suppose
the
guards
had
needed
more
time
on
omega
suppose
it
became
necessary
to
the
checkpoint
and
return
directly
to
earth
suppose
it
was
imperative
to
change
destination
altogether
who
reset
the
programs
who
gave
the
ship
its
orders
who
possessed
the
guiding
intelligence
that
directed
the
entire
operation
barrent
looked
around
the
control
room
he
found
a
storage
bin
filled
with
oxygen
respirators
he
put
one
on
tested
it
and
went
into
the
corridor
after
a
long
walk
he
reached
a
door
marked
crew
quarters
inside
the
room
was
neat
and
bare
the
beds
stood
in
neat
rows
without
sheets
or
blankets
there
were
no
clothes
in
the
closets
no
personal
possessions
of
any
kind
barrent
left
and
inspected
the
officers
and
quarters
he
found
no
sign
of
recent
human
habitation
he
returned
to
the
control
room
it
was
apparent
now
that
the
ship
had
no
crew
perhaps
the
authorities
on
earth
felt
so
certain
of
their
schedules
and
of
the
reliability
of
their
ship
that
they
had
decided
a
crew
was
superfluous
perhaps
but
it
seemed
to
barrent
a
reckless
way
of
doing
things
there
was
something
very
strange
about
an
earth
that
allowed
starships
to
run
without
human
supervision
he
decided
to
suspend
further
judgment
until
he
had
acquired
more
facts
for
the
time
being
he
had
to
think
about
the
problems
of
his
own
survival
there
was
concentrated
food
in
his
pockets
but
he
had
been
able
to
carry
much
water
would
the
crewless
ship
have
supplies
he
had
to
remember
the
detachment
of
guards
down
below
in
their
assembly
room
and
he
had
to
think
about
what
was
going
to
happen
at
the
checkpoint
and
what
he
would
do
about
it
barrent
found
that
he
did
not
have
to
use
his
own
food
supplies
in
the
officers
mess
machines
still
dispensed
food
and
drink
at
the
push
of
a
button
barrent
did
know
if
these
were
natural
or
chemically
reconstituted
foods
they
tasted
fine
and
seemed
to
nourish
him
so
he
really
did
care
he
explored
part
of
the
ship
upper
levels
after
becoming
lost
several
times
he
decided
not
to
take
any
more
unnecessary
risks
the
of
the
ship
was
its
control
room
and
barrent
spent
most
of
his
time
there
he
found
a
viewport
activating
the
switch
that
opened
the
shutters
barrent
was
able
to
look
out
on
the
vast
spectacle
of
stars
glowing
in
the
blackness
of
space
stars
without
end
stretched
past
the
furthest
limits
of
his
imagination
looking
at
this
barrent
felt
a
strong
surge
of
pride
this
was
where
he
belonged
and
those
unknown
stars
were
his
heritage
the
time
to
the
checkpoint
dwindled
to
six
hours
barrent
watched
new
portions
of
the
control
board
come
to
life
checking
and
altering
the
forces
governing
the
ship
preparing
for
a
landing
three
and
a
half
hours
before
landing
barrent
made
an
interesting
discovery
he
found
the
central
communication
system
for
the
entire
ship
by
turning
on
the
receiving
end
he
could
overhear
conversations
in
the
guardroom
he
did
learn
much
that
was
useful
to
him
either
through
caution
or
lack
of
concern
the
guards
did
discuss
politics
their
lives
were
spent
on
the
checkpoint
except
for
periods
of
service
on
the
prison
ship
some
of
the
things
they
said
barrent
found
incomprehensible
but
he
continued
to
listen
fascinated
by
anything
these
men
of
earth
had
to
say
you
ever
go
swimming
in
florida
i
never
liked
salt
water
the
year
before
i
was
called
to
the
guards
i
won
third
prize
at
the
dayton
orchid
fair
i
buying
a
retirement
villa
in
antarctica
how
much
longer
for
you
eighteen
years
well
someone
got
to
do
it
but
why
me
and
why
no
earth
leaves
you
watched
the
tapes
you
know
why
crime
is
a
disease
infectious
so
what
so
if
you
work
around
criminals
you
run
the
danger
of
infection
you
might
contaminate
someone
on
earth
it
is
fair
ca
be
helped
those
scientists
know
what
they
talking
about
besides
checkpoint
not
so
bad
if
you
like
everything
artificial
air
flowers
food
well
you
ca
have
everything
your
family
there
they
want
to
get
back
earthside
after
five
years
on
the
checkpoint
they
say
you
ca
take
earth
the
gravity
gets
you
i
take
gravity
any
time
from
these
conversations
barrent
learned
that
the
guards
were
human
beings
just
like
the
prisoners
on
omega
most
of
the
guards
did
seem
to
like
the
work
they
were
doing
like
omegans
they
longed
for
a
return
to
earth
he
stored
the
information
away
the
ship
had
reached
the
checkpoint
and
the
giant
switchboard
flashed
and
rippled
making
its
final
adjustments
for
the
intricacies
of
docking
at
last
the
maneuver
was
completed
and
the
engines
shut
down
to
through
the
communications
system
barrent
heard
the
guards
leave
their
assembly
room
he
followed
them
down
the
corridors
to
the
landing
stage
he
heard
the
last
of
them
as
he
left
the
ship
say
here
comes
the
check
squad
whatcha
say
boys
there
was
no
answer
the
guards
were
gone
and
there
was
a
new
sound
in
the
corridors
the
heavy
marching
feet
of
what
the
guard
called
the
check
squad
there
seemed
to
be
a
lot
of
them
their
inspection
began
in
the
engine
rooms
and
moved
methodically
upward
from
the
sounds
they
seemed
to
be
opening
every
door
on
the
ship
and
searching
every
room
and
closet
barrent
held
the
needlebeam
in
his
perspiring
hand
and
wondered
where
in
all
the
territory
of
the
ship
he
could
hide
he
would
have
to
assume
that
they
were
going
to
look
everywhere
in
that
case
his
best
chance
lay
in
evading
them
and
hiding
in
a
section
of
the
ship
already
searched
he
slipped
a
respirator
over
his
head
and
moved
into
the
corridor
chapter
half
an
hour
later
barrent
still
had
figured
out
a
way
of
getting
past
the
check
squad
they
had
finished
inspecting
the
lower
levels
and
were
moving
up
to
the
control
room
deck
barrent
could
hear
them
marching
down
the
hallways
he
kept
on
walking
a
hundred
yards
in
front
trying
to
find
some
way
of
hiding
there
should
be
a
staircase
at
the
end
of
this
passageway
he
could
take
it
down
to
a
different
level
a
part
of
the
ship
which
had
already
been
searched
he
hurried
on
wondering
if
he
were
wrong
about
the
location
of
the
staircase
he
still
had
only
the
haziest
idea
of
the
layout
of
the
ship
if
he
were
wrong
he
would
be
trapped
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
the
staircase
was
there
the
footsteps
behind
him
sounded
closer
he
started
down
peering
backwards
over
his
shoulder
and
ran
headfirst
into
a
man
huge
chest
barrent
flung
himself
back
bringing
his
plastic
gun
to
bear
on
the
enormous
figure
but
he
stopped
himself
from
firing
the
thing
that
stood
in
front
of
him
was
not
human
it
stood
nearly
seven
feet
high
dressed
in
a
black
uniform
with
inspection
team
android
stenciled
on
its
front
its
face
was
a
stylization
of
a
human
cleverly
sculptured
out
of
plastic
its
eyes
glowed
a
deep
impossible
red
it
swayed
on
two
legs
balancing
carefully
looking
at
barrent
moving
slowly
toward
him
barrent
backed
away
wondering
if
a
needlebeam
could
stop
it
he
never
had
a
chance
to
find
out
for
the
android
walked
past
him
and
continued
up
the
stairs
stenciled
on
the
back
of
its
uniform
were
the
words
rodent
control
division
this
particular
android
barrent
realized
was
programmed
only
to
look
for
rats
and
mice
the
presence
of
a
stowaway
had
made
no
impression
on
it
presumably
the
other
androids
were
similarly
specialized
he
stayed
in
an
empty
storage
room
on
a
lower
level
until
he
heard
the
sounds
of
the
androids
leaving
then
he
hurried
back
to
the
control
room
no
guards
came
aboard
exactly
on
schedule
the
big
ship
left
the
checkpoint
destination
earth
the
rest
of
the
journey
was
uneventful
barrent
slept
and
ate
and
before
the
craft
entered
subspace
watched
the
endless
spectacle
of
the
stars
through
the
viewport
he
tried
to
visualize
the
planet
he
was
coming
to
but
no
pictures
formed
in
his
mind
what
sort
of
a
people
built
huge
starships
but
failed
to
equip
them
with
a
crew
why
did
they
send
out
inspection
teams
then
give
those
teams
the
narrowest
and
most
specialized
sort
of
vision
why
did
they
have
to
deport
a
sizable
portion
of
their
population
and
then
fail
to
control
the
conditions
under
which
the
deportees
lived
and
died
why
was
it
necessary
for
them
to
wipe
the
prisoners
minds
clean
of
all
memory
of
earth
barrent
could
think
of
any
answers
the
control
room
clocks
moved
steadily
on
counting
off
the
minutes
and
hours
of
the
trip
the
ship
entered
then
emerged
from
subspace
and
went
into
deceleration
orbit
around
a
blue
and
green
world
which
barrent
observed
with
mixed
emotions
he
found
it
hard
to
realize
that
he
was
returning
at
last
to
earth
chapter
the
starship
landed
at
noon
on
a
brilliant
sunlit
day
somewhere
on
earth
north
american
continent
barrent
had
planned
on
waiting
for
darkness
before
leaving
but
the
control
room
screens
flashed
an
ancient
and
ironic
warning
passengers
and
crew
must
disembark
at
once
ship
rigged
for
full
decontamination
procedure
twenty
he
did
know
what
was
meant
by
full
decontamination
procedure
but
since
the
crew
was
emphatically
ordered
to
leave
a
respirator
might
not
provide
much
safety
of
the
two
dangers
leaving
the
ship
seemed
the
lesser
the
members
of
group
two
had
given
a
good
deal
of
thought
to
the
clothing
barrent
would
wear
upon
debarkation
those
first
minutes
on
earth
might
be
crucial
no
cunning
could
help
him
if
his
clothing
was
obviously
strange
outlandish
alien
typical
earth
clothing
was
the
answer
but
the
group
was
sure
what
the
citizens
of
earth
wore
one
part
of
the
group
had
wanted
barrent
to
dress
in
their
reconstructed
approximation
of
civilian
dress
another
part
felt
that
the
uniform
he
had
worn
on
board
would
see
him
through
his
arrival
on
earth
as
well
barrent
himself
had
agreed
with
a
third
opinion
which
felt
that
a
mechanic
coverall
would
be
least
noticeable
around
a
spacefield
and
suffer
the
least
change
of
style
over
the
years
in
the
towns
and
cities
this
disguise
might
put
him
at
a
disadvantage
but
he
had
to
meet
one
problem
at
a
time
he
quickly
stripped
off
his
guard
uniform
underneath
he
wore
the
lightweight
coveralls
his
needlebeam
concealed
a
collapsible
lunchbox
in
his
hand
barrent
walked
down
the
corridor
to
the
landing
stage
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
wondering
if
he
should
leave
the
weapon
on
the
ship
he
decided
not
to
part
with
it
an
inspection
would
reveal
him
anyhow
with
the
needlebeam
he
would
have
a
chance
of
breaking
away
from
police
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
marched
out
of
the
ship
and
down
the
landing
stage
there
were
no
guards
no
inspection
party
no
police
no
army
units
and
no
customs
officials
there
was
no
one
at
all
far
to
one
side
of
the
wide
field
he
could
see
rows
of
starcraft
glistening
in
the
sun
straight
ahead
of
him
was
a
fence
and
in
it
was
an
open
gate
barrent
walked
across
the
field
quickly
but
without
obvious
haste
he
had
no
idea
why
it
was
all
so
simple
perhaps
the
secret
police
on
earth
had
more
subtle
means
of
checking
on
passengers
from
starships
he
reached
the
gate
there
was
no
one
there
except
a
bald
man
and
a
boy
of
perhaps
ten
they
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
him
barrent
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
these
were
government
officials
still
who
knew
the
ways
of
earth
he
passed
through
the
gate
the
bald
man
holding
the
boy
by
the
hand
walked
over
to
him
i
beg
your
pardon
the
man
said
yes
i
saw
you
come
from
the
starship
would
you
mind
if
i
ask
you
a
few
questions
not
at
all
barrent
said
his
hand
near
the
coverall
zipper
beneath
which
lay
his
needlebeam
he
was
certain
now
that
the
bald
man
was
a
police
agent
the
only
thing
that
did
make
sense
was
the
presence
of
the
child
unless
the
boy
was
an
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
man
said
my
boy
ronny
here
is
doing
a
thesis
for
his
tenth
grade
master
degree
on
starships
so
i
wanted
to
see
one
ronny
said
he
was
an
undersized
child
with
a
pinched
intelligent
face
he
wanted
to
see
one
the
man
explained
i
told
him
it
necessary
since
all
the
facts
and
pictures
are
in
the
encyclopedia
but
he
wanted
to
see
one
it
gives
me
a
good
opening
paragraph
ronny
said
of
course
barrent
said
nodding
vigorously
he
was
beginning
to
wonder
about
the
man
for
a
member
of
the
secret
police
he
was
certainly
taking
a
devious
route
you
work
on
the
ships
ronny
asked
that
right
how
fast
do
they
go
in
real
or
subspace
barrent
asked
this
question
seemed
to
throw
ronny
off
his
stride
he
pushed
out
his
lower
lip
and
said
gee
i
did
know
they
went
in
subspace
he
thought
for
a
moment
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
think
i
know
what
subspace
is
barrent
and
the
boy
father
smiled
understandingly
well
ronny
said
how
fast
do
they
go
in
real
space
a
hundred
thousand
miles
an
hour
barrent
said
naming
the
first
figure
that
came
into
his
head
the
boy
nodded
and
his
father
nodded
very
fast
the
father
said
and
much
faster
in
subspace
of
course
barrent
said
of
course
the
man
said
starships
are
very
fast
indeed
they
have
to
be
quite
long
distances
involved
is
that
right
sir
very
long
distances
barrent
said
how
is
the
ship
powered
ronny
asked
in
the
usual
way
barrent
told
him
we
had
triplex
boosters
installed
last
year
but
that
comes
more
under
the
classification
of
auxiliary
power
i
heard
about
those
triplex
boosters
the
man
said
tremendous
things
they
adequate
barrent
said
judiciously
he
was
certain
now
that
this
man
was
just
what
he
purported
to
be
a
citizen
with
no
particular
knowledge
of
spacecraft
simply
bringing
his
son
to
the
starport
how
do
you
get
enough
air
ronny
asked
we
generate
our
own
barrent
said
but
air
is
any
trouble
the
big
problem
water
is
compressible
you
know
it
hard
to
store
in
sufficient
quantities
and
then
there
the
navigation
problem
when
the
ship
emerges
from
subspace
what
subspace
ronny
asked
in
effect
barrent
said
it
simply
a
different
level
of
real
space
but
you
can
find
all
that
in
your
encyclopedia
of
course
you
can
ronny
the
boy
father
said
we
must
keep
the
pilot
standing
here
i
sure
he
has
many
important
things
to
do
i
rather
rushed
barrent
said
look
around
all
you
want
good
luck
on
your
thesis
ronny
barrent
walked
for
fifty
yards
his
spine
tingling
expecting
momentarily
to
feel
the
blow
of
a
needlebeam
or
a
shotgun
but
when
he
looked
back
the
father
and
son
were
turned
away
from
him
earnestly
studying
the
great
vessel
barrent
hesitated
a
moment
deeply
bothered
so
far
the
whole
thing
had
been
entirely
too
easy
suspiciously
easy
but
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
but
go
on
the
road
from
the
starport
led
past
a
row
of
storage
sheds
to
a
section
of
woods
barrent
walked
until
he
was
out
of
sight
then
he
left
the
road
and
went
into
the
woods
he
had
had
enough
contact
with
people
for
his
first
day
on
earth
he
did
want
to
stretch
his
luck
he
wanted
to
think
things
over
sleep
in
the
woods
for
the
night
and
then
in
the
morning
go
to
a
city
or
town
he
pushed
his
way
past
dense
underbrush
into
the
forest
proper
here
he
walked
through
shaded
groves
of
giant
oaks
all
around
him
was
the
chirp
and
bustle
of
unseen
bird
and
animal
life
far
in
front
of
him
was
a
large
white
sign
nailed
to
a
tree
barrent
reached
it
and
read
forestdale
national
park
picnickers
and
campers
welcome
barrent
was
a
little
disappointed
even
though
he
realized
that
there
would
be
no
virgin
wilderness
so
near
a
starport
in
fact
on
a
planet
as
old
and
as
highly
developed
as
earth
there
was
probably
no
virgin
land
at
all
except
what
had
been
preserved
in
national
forests
the
sun
was
low
on
the
horizon
and
there
was
a
chill
in
the
long
shadows
thrown
across
the
forest
floor
barrent
found
a
comfortable
spot
under
a
gigantic
oak
arranged
leaves
for
a
bed
and
lay
down
he
had
a
great
deal
to
think
about
why
for
example
had
guards
been
posted
at
earth
most
important
contact
point
an
interstellar
terminus
did
security
measures
start
later
at
the
towns
and
cities
or
was
he
already
under
some
sort
of
surveillance
some
infinitely
subtle
spy
system
that
followed
his
every
movement
and
apprehended
him
only
when
ready
or
was
that
too
fanciful
could
it
be
that
good
evening
a
voice
said
close
to
his
right
ear
barrent
flung
himself
away
from
the
voice
in
a
spasm
of
nervous
reaction
his
hand
diving
for
his
needlebeam
and
a
very
pleasant
evening
it
is
the
voice
continued
here

your
friendly

i
like
to
welcome
all
of
you
old
and
new
to
your
friendly
national
forest
sitting
upright
in
the
gathering
darkness
barrent
peered
around
wondering
what
kind
of
a
trick
this
was
the
voice
really
did
seem
to
come
from
the
giant
oak
tree
the
enjoyment
of
nature
said
oaky
is
now
easy
and
convenient
for
everyone
you
can
enjoy
complete
seclusion
and
still
be
no
more
than
a
walk
from
public
transportation
for
those
who
do
not
desire
seclusion
we
have
guided
tours
at
nominal
cost
through
these
ancient
glades
remember
to
tell
your
friends
about
your
friendly
national
park
the
full
facilities
of
this
park
are
waiting
for
all
lovers
of
the
great
outdoors
a
panel
in
the
tree
opened
out
slid
a
bedroll
a
thermos
bottle
and
a
box
supper
i
wish
you
a
pleasant
evening
said
oaky
amid
the
wild
splendor
of
nature
wonderland
and
now
the

this

friendly
oak
tree
signing
off
music
emanated
from
several
hidden
speakers
barrent
scratched
his
head
then
deciding
to
take
matters
as
they
came
he
ate
the
food
drank
coffee
from
the
thermos
unrolled
the
bedroll
and
lay
down
sleepily
he
contemplated
the
notion
of
a
forest
wired
for
sound
equipped
with
food
and
drink
and
none
of
it
more
than
ten
minutes
from
public
transportation
earth
certainly
did
a
lot
for
her
citizens
presumably
they
liked
this
sort
of
thing
or
did
they
could
this
be
some
huge
and
subtle
trap
which
the
authorities
had
set
for
him
he
tossed
and
turned
for
a
while
trying
to
get
used
to
the
music
after
a
while
it
blended
into
the
background
of
windblown
leaves
and
creaking
branches
barrent
went
to
sleep
chapter
in
the
morning
the
friendly
oak
tree
dispensed
breakfast
and
shaving
equipment
barrent
ate
washed
and
shaved
and
set
out
for
the
nearest
town
he
had
his
objectives
firmly
in
mind
he
had
to
establish
some
sort
of
foolproof
disguise
and
he
had
to
make
contact
with
underground
when
this
was
accomplished
he
had
to
find
out
as
much
as
he
could
about
earth
secret
police
military
dispositions
and
the
like
group
two
had
worked
out
a
procedure
for
accomplishing
these
objectives
as
barrent
came
to
the
outskirts
of
a
town
he
hoped
that
the
methods
would
work
so
far
the
earth
he
was
on
had
very
little
resemblance
to
the
earth
which
the
group
had
reconstructed
he
walked
down
interminable
streets
lined
with
small
white
cottages
at
first
he
thought
every
house
looked
the
same
then
he
realized
that
each
had
one
or
two
small
architectural
differences
but
instead
of
distinguishing
the
houses
these
niggling
differences
simply
served
to
point
up
the
monotonous
similarities
there
were
hundreds
of
these
cottages
stretching
as
far
as
he
could
see
each
of
them
set
upon
a
little
plot
of
carefully
tended
grass
their
genteel
sameness
depressed
him
unexpectedly
he
missed
the
ridiculous
clumsy
individuality
of
omegan
buildings
he
reached
a
shopping
center
the
stores
repeated
the
pattern
set
by
the
houses
they
were
low
discreet
and
very
similar
only
a
close
inspection
of
window
displays
revealed
differences
between
a
food
store
and
a
sports
shop
he
passed
a
small
building
with
a
sign
that
read
robot
confessional
hours
a
it
seemed
to
be
some
sort
of
church
the
procedure
set
by
group
two
for
locating
the
underground
on
earth
was
simple
and
straightforward
revolutionaries
he
had
been
told
are
found
in
greatest
quantity
among
a
civilization
most
depressed
elements
poverty
breeds
dissatisfaction
the
want
to
take
from
those
who
have
therefore
the
logical
place
to
look
for
subversion
is
in
the
slums
it
was
a
good
theory
the
trouble
was
barrent
could
find
any
slums
he
walked
for
hours
past
neat
stores
and
pleasant
little
homes
playgrounds
and
parks
scrupulously
tended
farms
and
then
past
more
houses
and
stores
nothing
looked
much
better
or
worse
than
anything
else
by
evening
he
was
tired
and
footsore
as
far
as
he
could
tell
he
had
discovered
nothing
of
significance
before
he
could
penetrate
any
deeper
into
the
complexities
of
earth
he
would
have
to
question
the
local
citizens
it
was
a
dangerous
step
but
one
which
he
could
not
avoid
he
stood
near
a
clothing
store
in
the
gathering
dusk
and
decided
upon
a
course
of
action
he
would
pose
as
a
foreigner
a
man
newly
arrived
in
north
america
from
asia
or
europe
in
that
way
he
should
be
able
to
ask
questions
with
a
measure
of
safety
a
man
was
walking
toward
him
a
plump
fellow
in
a
brown
business
tunic
barrent
stopped
him
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
a
stranger
here
just
arrived
from
rome
really
the
man
said
yes
i
afraid
i
do
understand
things
over
here
very
well
barrent
said
with
an
apologetic
little
laugh
i
ca
seem
to
find
any
cheap
hotels
if
you
could
direct
me
citizen
do
you
feel
all
right
the
man
asked
his
face
hardening
as
i
said
i
a
foreigner
and
i
looking
now
look
the
man
said
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
there
any
outlanders
any
more
there
are
of
course
not
i
in
rome
it
just
like
here
in
wilmington
same
sort
of
houses
and
stores
no
one
an
outlander
any
more
barrent
could
think
of
anything
to
say
he
smiled
nervously
furthermore
the
man
said
there
are
no
cheap
lodgings
anywhere
on
earth
why
should
there
be
who
would
stay
in
them
who
indeed
barrent
said
i
guess
i
had
a
little
too
much
to
drink
no
one
drinks
any
more
the
man
said
i
do
understand
what
sort
of
a
game
is
this
what
sort
of
a
game
do
you
it
is
barrent
asked
falling
back
on
a
technique
which
the
group
had
recommended
the
man
stared
at
him
frowning
i
think
i
get
it
he
said
you
must
be
an
opinioner
mmm
barrent
said
noncommittally
sure
that
it
the
man
said
you
one
of
those
citizens
goes
around
asking
people
opinions
for
surveys
and
that
sort
of
thing
right
you
made
a
very
intelligent
guess
barrent
said
well
i
do
suppose
it
was
too
hard
opinioners
are
always
walking
around
trying
to
get
people
attitudes
on
things
i
would
have
spotted
you
right
away
if
you
been
wearing
opinioners
clothing
the
man
started
to
frown
again
how
come
you
are
dressed
like
an
opinioner
i
just
graduated
barrent
said
have
had
a
chance
to
get
the
clothes
oh
well
you
should
get
the
proper
wear
the
man
said
sententiously
how
can
a
citizen
tell
your
status
just
a
test
sampling
barrent
said
thank
you
for
your
cooperation
sir
perhaps
i
have
a
chance
to
interview
you
again
in
the
near
future
any
time
the
man
said
he
nodded
politely
and
walked
off
barrent
thought
about
it
and
decided
that
the
occupation
of
opinioner
was
perfect
for
him
it
would
give
him
the
right
to
ask
questions
to
meet
people
to
find
out
how
earth
lived
he
would
have
to
be
careful
of
course
not
to
reveal
his
ignorance
but
working
with
circumspection
he
should
have
a
general
knowledge
of
this
civilization
in
a
few
days
first
he
would
have
to
buy
opinioners
clothing
that
seemed
to
be
important
the
trouble
was
he
had
no
money
with
which
to
pay
for
it
the
group
had
been
unable
to
duplicate
earth
money
they
could
even
remember
what
it
looked
like
but
they
had
provided
him
with
a
means
of
overcoming
even
that
obstacle
barrent
turned
and
went
into
the
nearest
costumer
the
proprietor
was
a
short
man
with
eyes
and
a
ready
smile
he
welcomed
barrent
and
asked
how
he
could
be
of
service
i
need
opinioners
clothing
barrent
told
him
i
just
graduated
of
course
sir
the
owner
said
and
you
come
to
the
right
place
for
it
most
of
the
smaller
stores
do
carry
the
clothing
for
anything
but
the
more
ah
common
professions
but
here
at
jules
wonderson
we
have
for
all
of
the
five
hundred
and
twenty
major
professions
listed
in
the
civil
status
almanac
i
am
jules
wonderson
a
pleasure
barrent
said
have
you
a
in
my
size
i
sure
i
have
wonderson
said
would
you
care
for
a
regular
or
a
special
a
regular
will
do
nicely
most
new
opinioners
prefer
the
special
wonderson
said
the
little
extra
simulated
handmade
touches
increase
the
public
respect
in
that
case
i
take
the
special
yes
sir
though
if
you
could
wait
a
day
or
two
we
will
be
having
in
a
new
fabric
a
simulated
home
loom
complete
with
natural
weaving
mistakes
for
the
man
of
status
discrimination
a
real
prestige
item
perhaps
i
come
back
for
that
barrent
said
right
now
i
need
a
of
course
sir
wonderson
said
disappointed
but
hiding
it
bravely
if
you
wait
just
one
little
minute
after
several
fittings
barrent
found
himself
wearing
a
black
business
suit
with
a
thin
edge
of
white
piping
around
the
lapels
to
his
inexperienced
eye
it
looked
almost
exactly
like
the
other
suits
wonderson
had
on
display
for
bankers
stock
brokers
grocers
accountants
and
the
like
but
for
wonderson
who
talked
about
the
banker
lapel
and
the
insurance
agent
drape
the
differences
were
as
clear
as
the
gross
of
omega
barrent
decided
it
was
just
a
question
of
training
there
sir
wonderson
said
a
perfect
fit
and
a
fabric
guaranteed
for
a
lifetime
all
for
excellent
barrent
said
now
about
the
money
yes
sir
barrent
took
the
plunge
i
have
any
you
have
sir
that
quite
unusual
yes
it
is
barrent
said
however
i
have
certain
articles
of
value
from
his
pocket
he
took
three
diamond
rings
with
which
the
group
on
omega
had
supplied
him
these
stones
are
genuine
diamonds
as
any
jeweler
will
be
glad
to
attest
if
you
would
take
one
of
them
until
i
have
the
money
for
payment
but
sir
wonderson
said
diamonds
and
such
have
no
intrinsic
value
they
have
since
when
von
blon
wrote
the
definitive
work
destroying
the
concept
of
scarcity
value
of
course
barrent
said
at
a
loss
for
words
wonderson
looked
at
the
rings
i
suppose
these
have
a
sentimental
value
though
certainly
we
had
them
in
the
family
for
generations
in
that
case
wonderson
said
i
would
want
to
deprive
you
of
them
please
no
arguments
sir
sentiment
is
the
most
priceless
of
emotions
i
could
sleep
nights
if
i
took
even
one
of
these
family
heirlooms
from
you
but
there
the
matter
of
payment
pay
me
at
your
leisure
you
mean
you
trust
me
even
though
you
do
know
me
most
certainly
wonderson
said
he
smiled
archly
trying
out
your
opinioner
methods
are
you
well
even
a
child
knows
that
our
civilization
is
based
upon
trust
not
collateral
it
is
axiomatic
that
even
a
stranger
is
to
be
trusted
until
he
has
conclusively
and
unmistakably
proven
otherwise
have
you
ever
been
cheated
of
course
not
crime
is
nonexistent
these
days
in
that
case
barrent
asked
what
about
omega
i
beg
your
pardon
omega
the
prison
planet
you
must
have
heard
of
it
i
think
i
have
wonderson
said
cautiously
well
i
should
have
said
that
crime
is
nonexistent
i
suppose
there
will
always
be
a
few
congenital
criminal
types
easily
recognizable
as
such
but
told
they
do
amount
to
more
than
ten
or
twelve
individuals
a
year
out
of
a
population
of
nearly
two
billion
he
smiled
broadly
my
chances
of
meeting
one
are
exceedingly
rare
barrent
thought
about
the
prison
ships
constantly
shuttling
back
and
forth
between
earth
and
omega
dumping
their
human
cargo
and
returning
for
more
he
wondered
where
wonderson
got
his
statistics
for
that
matter
he
wondered
where
the
police
were
he
had
seen
no
military
uniform
since
leaving
the
starship
he
would
have
liked
to
ask
about
it
but
it
seemed
wiser
to
discontinue
that
line
of
questioning
thank
you
very
much
for
the
credit
barrent
said
i
be
back
with
the
payment
as
soon
as
possible
of
course
you
will
wonderson
said
warmly
shaking
barrent
hand
take
your
time
sir
no
rush
at
all
barrent
thanked
him
again
and
left
the
store
he
had
a
profession
now
and
if
other
people
believed
as
wonderson
did
he
had
unlimited
credit
he
was
on
a
planet
that
seemed
at
first
glance
to
be
a
utopia
the
utopia
presented
certain
contradictions
of
course
he
hoped
to
find
out
more
about
them
over
the
next
few
days
down
the
block
barrent
found
a
hotel
called
the
he
engaged
a
room
for
the
week
on
credit
chapter
in
the
morning
barrent
asked
directions
to
the
nearest
branch
of
the
public
library
he
decided
that
he
needed
as
much
background
out
of
books
as
he
could
get
with
a
knowledge
of
the
history
and
development
of
earth
civilization
he
would
have
a
better
idea
of
what
to
expect
and
what
to
watch
out
for
his
opinioner
clothing
allowed
him
access
to
the
closed
shelves
where
the
history
books
were
kept
but
the
books
themselves
were
disappointing
most
of
them
were
earth
ancient
history
from
earliest
beginnings
to
the
dawn
of
atomic
power
barrent
skimmed
through
them
as
he
read
some
memories
of
prior
reading
returned
to
him
he
was
able
to
jump
quickly
from
periclean
greece
to
imperial
rome
to
charlemagne
and
the
dark
ages
from
the
norman
conquest
to
the
thirty
years
war
and
then
to
a
rapid
survey
of
the
napoleonic
era
he
read
with
more
care
about
the
world
wars
the
book
ended
with
the
explosion
of
the
first
atom
bombs
the
other
books
on
the
shelf
were
simply
amplifications
of
various
stages
of
history
he
had
found
in
the
first
book
after
a
great
deal
of
searching
barrent
found
a
small
work
entitled
the
postwar
dilemma
volume
by
arthur
whittler
it
began
where
the
other
histories
had
left
off
with
the
atomic
bombs
exploding
over
hiroshima
and
nagasaki
barrent
sat
down
and
began
to
read
carefully
he
learned
about
the
cold
war
of
the
when
several
nations
were
in
possession
of
atomic
and
hydrogen
weapons
already
the
author
stated
the
seeds
of
a
massive
and
stultifying
conformity
were
present
in
the
nations
of
the
world
in
america
there
was
the
frenzied
resistance
to
communism
in
russia
and
china
there
was
the
frenzied
resistance
to
capitalism
one
by
one
all
the
nations
of
the
world
were
drawn
into
one
camp
or
the
other
for
purposes
of
internal
security
all
countries
relied
upon
the
newest
propaganda
and
indoctrination
techniques
all
countries
felt
they
needed
for
survival
sake
a
rigid
adherence
to
doctrines
the
pressure
upon
the
individual
to
conform
became
both
stronger
and
subtler
the
dangers
of
war
passed
the
many
societies
of
earth
began
to
merge
into
a
single
superstate
but
the
pressure
to
conform
instead
of
lessening
grew
more
intense
the
need
was
dictated
by
the
continued
explosive
increase
in
population
and
the
many
problems
of
unification
across
national
and
ethnic
lines
differences
in
opinion
could
be
deadly
too
many
groups
now
had
access

supremely
deadly
hydrogen

under

behavior
could

unification
was
finally
completed
the
conquest
of
space
went
on
from

ship
to

ship
to

ship
but
earth
became
increasingly
rigid
in
its
institutions
a
civilization
more
inflexible
than
anything
produced
by
medieval
europe
punished
any
opposition
to
existing
customs
habits
beliefs
these
breaches
of
the
social
contract
were
considered
major
crimes
as
serious
as
murder
or
arson
they
were
punished
similarly
the
antique
institutions
of
secret
police
political
police
informers
all
were
used
every
possible
device
was
brought
to
bear
toward
the
goal
of
conformity
for
the
nonconformists
there
was
omega
capital
punishment
had
been
banished
long
before
but
there
was
neither
room
nor
resources
to
take
the
growing
number
of
criminals
who
crammed
prisons
everywhere
the
world
leaders
finally
decided
to
transport
these
criminals
to
a
separate
prison
world
copying
a
system
which
the
french
had
used
in
guiana
and
new
caledonia
and
the
british
had
used
in
australia
and
early
north
america
since
it
was
impossible
to
rule
omega
from
earth
the
authorities
did
try
they
simply
made
sure
that
none
of
the
prisoners
escaped
that
was
the
end
of
volume
one
a
note
at
the
end
said
that
volume
two
was
to
be
a
study
of
contemporary
earth
it
was
entitled
status
the
second
volume
was
not
on
the
shelves
barrent
asked
the
librarian
and
was
told
that
it
had
been
destroyed
in
the
interests
of
public
safety
barrent
left
the
library
and
went
to
a
little
park
he
sat
and
stared
at
the
ground
and
tried
to
think
he
had
expected
to
find
an
earth
similar
to
the
one
described
in
whittler
book
he
had
been
prepared
for
a
police
state
tight
security
controls
a
repressed
populace
and
a
growing
air
of
unrest
but
that
apparently
was
the
past
so
far
he
had
even
seen
a
policeman
he
had
observed
no
security
controls
and
the
people
he
had
met
did
not
seem
harshly
repressed
quite
the
contrary
this
seemed
like
a
completely
different
world
except
that
year
after
year
the
ships
came
to
omega
with
their
cargoes
of
brainwashed
prisoners
who
arrested
them
who
judged
them
what
sort
of
a
society
produced
them
he
would
have
to
find
out
the
answers
himself
chapter
early
the
next
morning
barrent
began
his
exploration
his
technique
was
simple
he
rang
doorbells
and
asked
questions
he
warned
all
his
subjects
that
his
real
questions
might
be
interspersed
with
tricks
or
nonsense
questions
whose
purpose
was
to
test
the
general
awareness
level
in
that
way
barrent
found
he
could
ask
anything
at
all
about
earth
could
explore
controversial
or
even
nonexistent
areas
and
do
so
without
revealing
his
own
ignorance
there
was
still
the
danger
that
some
official
would
ask
for
his
credentials
or
that
the
police
would
mysteriously
spring
up
when
least
expected
but
he
had
to
take
those
risks
starting
at
the
beginning
of
orange
esplanade
barrent
worked
his
way
northward
calling
at
each
house
as
he
went
his
results
were
uneven
as
a
selective
sampling
of
his

imperious
but
polite
with
a
air
about
you
want
to
ask
me
about
class
and
status
is
that
it
yes
you
opinioners
are
asking
about
class
and
status
one
would
think
you
know
all
about
it
by
now
but
very
well
today
since
everyone
is
equal
there
is
only
one
class
the
class
the
only
question
then
is
to
what
portion
of
the
middle
class
does
one
belong
high
low
or
middle
and
how
is
that
determined
why
by
all
sorts
of
things
the
way
a
person
speaks
eats
dresses
the
way
he
acts
in
public
his
manners
his
clothing
you
can
always
tell
your
upper
middle
class
man
by
his
clothes
it
quite
unmistakable
i
see
and
the
lower
middle
classes
well
for
one
thing
they
lack
creative
energy
they
wear
clothing
for
example
without
taking
the
trouble
to
improve
upon
it
the
same
goes
for
their
homes
mere
uninspired
adornment
wo
do
let
me
add
that
simply
the
mark
of
the
upper
middle
class
one
does
receive
such
persons
in
the
home
thank
you
citizen
gotthreid
and
where
would
you
classify
yourself
statuswise
with
the
very
faintest
hesitation
oh
i
never
thought
much
about
it

a

for

yes
sir
myra
and
i
have
three
children
of
school
age
all
boys
could
you
give
me
some
idea
what
their
education
consists
of
they
learn
how
to
read
and
write
and
how
to
become
good
citizens
they
already
starting
to
learn
their
trades
the
oldest
is
going
into
the
family
business
shoes
the
other
two
are
taking
apprenticeship
courses
in
groceries
and
retail
marketing
that
my
wife
business
they
also
learn
how
to
retain
status
and
how
to
utilize
standard
techniques
for
moving
upward
that
about
what
goes
on
in
the
open
classes
are
there
other
school
classes
which
are
not
open
well
naturally
there
are
the
closed
classes
every
child
attends
them
and
what
do
they
learn
in
the
closed
classes
i
do
know
they
closed
as
i
said
do
the
children
ever
speak
about
those
classes
no
they
talk
about
everything
under
the
sun
but
not
about
that
have
you
any
idea
what
goes
on
in
the
closed
classes
sorry
i
do
at
a
guess
and
it
only
a
guess
mind
you
i
say
it
probably
something
religious
but
you
have
to
ask
a
teacher
for
that
thank
you
sir
and
how
do
you
classify
yourself
statuswise
middle
middle

not
much

about

for

i
beg
your
pardon
sir
the
closed
classes
you
have
discussed
those
i
afraid
i
ca
why
not
citizen
morgan
is
this
a
trick
question
everyone
knows
that
teachers
are
allowed
in
the
closed
classes
who
allowed
in
the
children
of
course
but
who
teaches
them
the
government
is
in
charge
of
that
of
course
but
who
specifically
does
the
teaching
in
the
closed
classes
i
have
no
idea
sir
it
none
of
my
business
the
closed
classes
are
an
ancient
and
respected
institution
what
goes
on
in
them
is
quite
possibly
of
a
religious
nature
but
that
only
a
guess
whatever
it
is
it
none
of

is
it

please
what
was
that
question
again
about
the
armed
forces
specifically
i
asked
i
remember
now
yes
young
man
i
was
a
colonel
in
the
north
american
spaceborne
commando
which
was
a
regular
unit
of
the
earth
defense
corps
and
did
you
retire
from
the
service
no
the
service
retired
from
me
i
beg
pardon
sir
you
heard
me
correctly
young
man
it
happened
just
years
ago
the
earth
armed
forces
were
demobilized
except
for
the
police
whom
i
can
not
count
but
all
regular
units
were
demobilized
why
was
that
done
sir
there
was
anyone
to
fight
was
even
anyone
to
guard
against
or
so
i
was
told
damned
foolish
business
i
say
why
sir
because
an
old
soldier
knows
that
you
can
never
tell
when
an
enemy
might
spring
up
it
could
happen
now
and
then
where
would
we
be
could
the
armies
be
formed
again
certainly
but
the
present
generation
has
no
concept
of
serving
under
arms
there
are
no
leaders
left
outside
of
a
few
useless
old
fools
like
me
it
would
take
years
for
an
effective
force
effectively
led
to
be
formed
and
in
the
meantime
earth
is
completely
open
to
invasion
from
the
outside
yes
except
for
the
police
units
and
i
seriously
doubt
their
reliability
under
fire
could
you
tell
me
about
the
police
there
is
nothing
i
know
about
them
i
have
never
bothered
my
head
about
matters
but
it
is
conceivable
that
the
police
have
now
taken
over
the
functions
of
the
army
is
it
that
the
police
constitute
a
sizable
and
disciplined
paramilitary
force
it
is

certainly
not
these
are

incompetent

for

delectation

in

you

are

from
the
works
of
various
popular
writers
of

the
people
who
do

merely
substitute
adjectives

occasionally
i
told
a
more
daring
hack
will
substitute
a
verb
or
even
a

that
is
rare
the

frown

you

absolutely

would
you
mind
telling
me
what
that
means
citizen

i
be
happy
to
my
own
particular
field
of
endeavor
lies
in
the
works
of
joseph
conrad
an
author
who
lived
in
the
era
how
do
you
go
about
those
works
sir
well
at
present
i
am
engaged
in
my
fifth
of
to
do
it
i
steep
myself
as
thoroughly
as
possible
in
the
original
work
then
i
set
about
rewriting
it
as
conrad
would
have
written
it
if
he
had
lived
today
it
is
a
labor
which
calls
for
extreme
diligence
and
for
the
utmost
in
artistic
integrity
a
single
slip
could
mar
the
as
you
can
see
it
calls
for
a
preliminary
mastery
of
conrad
vocabulary
themes
plots
characters
mood
approach
and
so
on
all
this
goes
in
and
yet
the
book
can
not
be
a
slavish
it
must
have
something
new
to
say
just
as
conrad
would
have
said
it
and
have
you
succeeded
the
critics
have
been
generous
and
my
publisher
gives
me
every
encouragement
when
you
have
finished
your

no

now
then
would
you
mind
telling

what
you
do

i
do
mind
what
happens
then
i
do

we
all
go

and
we
come

two
hours
later

that
all

i

they
ca
remember

no

if
we
were

when
i
was

kid
i
worked
up
an
improved
seeder
harvester
designed
to
be
approximately
three
times
as
efficient
as
the
present
models
and
would
you
believe
it
i
really
thought
i
had
a
chance
of
selling
it
did
you
sell
it
of
course
not
at
that
time
i
did
realize
that
the
patent
office
was
closed
permanently
except
for
the
games
section
were
you
angry
about
that
a
little
angry
at
the
time
but
i
soon
realized
that
the
models
we
have
are
plenty
good
enough
there
no
need
for
more
efficient
or
more
ingenious
inventions
folks
today
are
satisfied
with
what
they
got
besides
new
inventions
would
be
of
no
service
to
mankind
earth
birth
and
death
rate
are
stable
and
there
enough
for
everyone
to
produce
a
new
invention
you
have
to
retool
an
entire
factory
that
would
be
almost
impossible
since
all
the
factories
today
are
automatic
and
that
why
there
a
moratorium
on
invention
except
in
the
novelty
game
field
how
do
you
feel
about
it
what
there
to
feel
that
how

are
would
you
like

it
true
from

it
all
completely

even

minimal
what
happens
if

breaks
down
it
gets
fixed
by

and
if
they
break
down
the

are
all
i
can

is
stand

fill

why
do
you

they
were
not
programmed
they
be
paralyzed
at
least
temporarily
i
think
they
have
an
selector
which
is
supposed
to
take
over
unstructured
situations
but
it
never
been
tried
out
at
best
it
would
react
sluggishly
at
worst
it
would
work
at
all
and
that
would
be
fine
by
me
do
you
really
mean
that
i
certainly
do
i
sick
of
standing
around
watching
a
machine
do
the
same
thing
day
after
day
most
of
the
professional
men
i
know
feel
the
same
way
we
want
to
do
something
anything
did
you
know
that
a
hundred
years
ago
starships
were
exploring
the
planets
of
other
solar
systems
yes
well
that
what
we
should
be
doing
now
moving
outward
exploring
advancing
that
what
we
need
i
agree
but
do
you
think
you
saying
rather
dangerous
things
i
know
i
am
but
frankly
i
just
do
care
any
longer
let
them
ship
me
to
omega
if
they
want
to
i
doing
no
good
here
then
you
heard
about
omega
anyone
connected
with
starships
knows
about
omega
round
trips
between
omega
and
earth
that
all
our
ships
do
it
a
terrible
world
personally
i
put
the
blame
on
the
clergy
the
clergy
absolutely
those
sanctimonious
fools
with
their
endless
drivel
about
the
church
of
the
spirit
of
mankind
incarnate
it
enough
to
make
a
man
wish
for
a
little
evil
father
boeren
age
occupation
clergyman
a
stately
man
wearing
a
saffron
robe
and
white
that
right
my
son
i
am
the
abbot
of
the
local
branch
of
the
church
of
the
spirit
of
mankind
incarnate
our
church
is
the
official
and
exclusive
religious
expression
of
the
government
of
earth
our
religion
speaks
for
all
the
peoples
of
earth
it
is
a
composite
of
the
best
elements
of
all
the
former
religions
both
major
and
minor
skillfully
blended
into
a
single
faith
citizen
abbot
are
there
bound
to
be
contradictions
in
doctrine
among
the
various
religions
which
make
up
your
faith
there
but
the
forgers
of
our
present
church
threw
out
all
controversial
matter
we
wanted
agreement
not
dissension
we
preserve
only
certain
colorful
facets
of
those
early
great
religions
facets
with
which
people
can
identify
there
have
never
been
any
schisms
in
our
religion
because
we
are
one
may
believe
anything
one
wishes
as
long
as
it
preserves
the
holy
spirit
of
mankind
incarnate
for
our
worship
you
see
is
the
true
worship
of
man
and
the
spirit
we
recognize
is
the
spirit
of
the
divine
and
holy
good
would
you
define
good
for
me
citizen
abbot
certainly
good
is
that
force
within
us
which
inspires
men
to
acts
of
conformity
and
subservience
the
worship
of
good
is
essentially
the
worship
of
oneself
and
therefore
the
only
true
worship
the
self
which
one
worships
is
the
ideal
social
being
the
man
content
in
his
niche
in
society
yet
ready
to
creatively
advance
his
status
good
is
gentle
since
it
is
a
true
reflection
of
the
loving
and
pitying
universe
good
is
continually
changing
in
its
aspects
although
it
comes
to
us
in
the
you
have
a
strange
look
on
your
face
young
man
i
sorry
citizen
abbot
i
believe
i
heard
that
sermon
or
one
very
much
like
it
it
is
true
wherever
one
hears
it
of
course
one
more
question
sir
could
you
tell
me
about
the
religious
instruction
of
children
that
duty
is
performed
for
us
by
the
yes
the
notion
came
to
us
from
the
ancient
of
transcendental
freudianism
the
instructs
children
and
adults
alike
it
hears
their
problems
within
the
social
matrix
it
is
their
constant
friend
their
social
mentor
their
religious
instructor
being
robotic
the
confessors
are
able
to
give
exact
and
unvarying
answers
to
any
question
this
aids
the
great
work
of
conformity
i
can
see
that
it
does
what
do
the
human
priests
do
they
watch
over
the
are
these
present
in
the
closed
classrooms
i
am
not
competent
to
answer
that
they
are
are
they
i
truly
do
not
know
the
closed
classrooms
are
closed
to
abbots
as
well
as
other
adults
by
whose
order
by
order
of
the
chief
of
the
secret
police
i
see
thank

sir

through
there
just
make
yourself
comfortable
chapter
dravivian
led
him
into
a
large
room
paneled
in
walnut
the
furniture
was
of
a
heavy
black
wood
intricately
carved
and
varnished
the
desk
high
and
straight
seemed
to
be
an
antique
a
heavy
tapestry
covered
one
entire
wall
it
depicted
in
fading
colors
a
medieval
hunting
scene
do
you
like
it
dravivian
asked
my
family
did
the
furnishing
my
wife
copied
the
tapestry
from
an
original
in
the
metropolitan
museum
my
two
sons
collaborated
on
the
furniture
they
wanted
something
ancient
and
spanish
in
feeling
but
with
more
comfort
than
antiques
usually
give
a
slight
modification
of
the
lines
accomplished
that
my
own
contributions
are
not
visible
music
of
the
baroque
period
is
my
specialty
aside
from
policework
barrent
said
yes
aside
from
that
dravivian
turned
away
from
barrent
and
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
tapestry
we
will
come
to
the
matter
of
the
police
in
due
course
tell
me
first
what
do
you
think
of
this
room
it
very
beautiful
barrent
said
yes
and
well
i
no
judge
you
judge
dravivian
said
in
this
room
you
can
see
civilization
in
miniature
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
it
feels
lifeless
barrent
said
dravivian
turned
to
barrent
and
smiled
yes
that
a
good
word
for
it
might
perhaps
be
better
this
is
a
room
barrent
a
great
deal
of
creativity
has
gone
into
the
artistic
improvement
of
ancient
archetypes
my
family
has
a
bit
of
the
spanish
past
as
others
have
bits
of
the
mayan
early
american
or
oceanic
past
and
yet
the
essential
hollowness
is
obvious
our
automatized
factories
produce
the
same
goods
for
us
year
in
and
year
out
since
everyone
has
these
same
goods
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
change
the
factory
product
to
improve
and
embroider
it
to
express
ourselves
through
it
to
rank
ourselves
by
it
that
how
earth
is
barrent
our
energy
and
skills
are
channeled
into
essentially
decadent
pursuits
we
old
furniture
worry
about
rank
and
status
and
in
the
meantime
the
frontier
of
the
distant
planets
remains
unexplored
and
unconquered
we
ceased
long
ago
to
expand
stability
brought
the
danger
of
stagnation
to
which
we
succumbed
we
became
so
highly
socialized
that
individuality
had
to
be
diverted
to
the
most
harmless
of
pursuits
turned
inward
kept
from
any
meaningful
expression
i
think
you
have
seen
a
fair
amount
of
that
in
your
time
on
earth
i
have
but
i
never
expected
to
hear
the
chief
of
the
secret
police
say
it
i
an
unusual
man
dravivian
said
with
a
mocking
smile
and
the
secret
police
is
an
unusual
institution
it
must
be
very
efficient
how
did
you
find
out
about
me
that
was
really
quite
simple
most
of
the
people
of
earth
are
from
childhood
it
part
of
our
heritage
you
know
nearly
all
the
people
you
met
were
able
to
tell
that
there
was
something
very
wrong
about
you
you
were
as
obviously
out
of
place
as
a
wolf
among
sheep
people
noticed
and
reported
directly
to
me
all
right
barrent
said
now
what
first
i
would
like
you
to
tell
me
about
omega
barrent
told
the
police
chief
about
his
life
on
the
prison
planet
dravivian
nodded
a
faint
smile
on
his
lips
yes
it
very
much
as
i
expected
he
said
the
same
sort
of
thing
has
happened
on
omega
as
happened
in
early
america
and
australia
there
are
differences
of
course
you
have
been
shut
off
more
completely
from
the
mother
country
but
the
same
fierce
energy
and
drive
is
there
and
the
same
ruthlessness
what
are
you
going
to
do
barrent
asked
dravivian
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
really
does
matter
i
suppose
i
could
kill
you
but
that
would
stop
your
group
on
omega
from
sending
out
other
spies
or
from
seizing
one
of
the
prison
ships
as
soon
as
the
omegans
begin
to
move
in
force
they
discover
the
truth
anyhow
what
truth
by
now
it
must
be
obvious
to
you
dravivian
said
earth
has
fought
a
war
for
nearly
eight
hundred
years
we
would
know
how
the
organization
of
guardships
around
omega
is
pure
façade
the
ships
are
completely
automatized
built
to
meet
conditions
of
several
hundreds
years
ago
a
determined
attack
will
capture
a
ship
and
when
you
have
one
the
rest
will
fall
after
that
there
nothing
to
stop
the
omegans
from
coming
back
to
earth
and
there
nothing
on
earth
to
fight
them
with
this
you
must
realize
is
the
reason
why
all
prisoners
leaving
earth
are
divorced
from
their
memories
if
they
vulnerability
would
be
painfully
apparent
if
you
knew
all
this
barrent
asked
why
did
your
leaders
do
something
about
it
that
was
our
original
intention
but
there
was
no
real
drive
behind
the
intention
we
preferred
not
to
think
about
it
we
assumed
the
status
quo
would
remain
indefinitely
we
did
want
to
think
about
the
day
when
the
omegans
returned
to
earth
what
are
you
and
your
police
going
to
do
about
it
barrent
asked
i
am
façade
too
dravivian
told
him
i
have
no
police
the
position
of
chief
is
entirely
honorary
there
has
been
no
need
of
a
police
force
on
earth
for
close
to
a
century
you
going
to
need
one
when
the
omegans
come
home
barrent
said
yes
there
going
to
be
crime
again
and
serious
trouble
but
i
think
the
final
amalgamation
will
be
successful
you
on
omega
have
the
drive
the
ambition
to
reach
the
stars
i
believe
you
need
a
certain
stability
and
creativeness
which
earth
can
provide
whatever
the
results
the
union
is
inevitable
we
lived
in
a
dream
here
for
too
long
going
to
take
violent
measures
to
awaken
us
dravivian
rose
to
his
feet
and
now
he
said
since
the
fate
of
earth
and
omega
seem
to
be
decided
could
i
offer
you
some
refreshment
chapter
with
the
help
of
the
chief
of
police
barrent
put
a
message
aboard
the
next
ship
to
leave
for
omega
the
message
told
about
conditions
on
earth
and
urged
immediate
action
when
that
was
finished
barrent
was
ready
for
his
final
job
to
find
the
judge
who
had
sentenced
him
for
a
crime
he
had
committed
and
the
lying
informer
who
had
turned
him
in
to
the
judge
when
he
found
those
two
barrent
knew
he
would
regain
the
missing
portions
of
his
memory
he
took
the
night
expressway
to
youngerstun
his
suspicions
sharply
keyed
from
life
on
omega
would
not
let
him
rest
there
had
to
be
a
catch
to
all
this
splendid
simplicity
perhaps
he
would
find
it
in
youngerstun
by
early
morning
he
was
there
superficially
the
neat
rows
of
houses
looked
the
same
as
in
any
other
town
but
for
barrent
they
were
different
and
achingly
familiar
he
this
town
and
the
monotonous
houses
had
individuality
and
meaning
for
him
he
had
been
born
and
raised
in
this
town
there
was
grothmeir
store
and
across
the
street
was
the
home
of
havening
the
local
interior
decorating
champion
here
was
billy
havelock
house
billy
had
been
his
best
friend
they
had
planned
on
being
starmen
together
and
had
remained
good
friends
after
school
until
barrent
had
been
sentenced
to
omega
here
was
andrew
therkaler
house
and
down
the
block
was
the
school
he
had
attended
he
could
remember
the
classes
he
could
remember
how
every
day
they
had
gone
through
the
door
that
led
to
the
closed
class
but
he
still
could
not
remember
what
he
had
learned
there
right
here
near
two
huge
elms
the
murder
had
taken
place
barrent
walked
to
the
spot
and
remembered
how
it
had
happened
he
had
been
on
his
way
home
from
somewhere
down
the
street
he
had
heard
a
scream
he
had
turned
and
a
man
illiardi
had
run
down
the
street
and
thrown
something
at
him
barrent
had
caught
it
instinctively
and
found
himself
holding
an
illegal
handgun
a
few
steps
further
he
had
looked
into
the
twisted
dead
face
of
andrew
therkaler
and
what
had
happened
next
confusion
panic
a
sensation
of
someone
watching
as
he
stood
weapon
in
hand
over
the
corpse
there
at
the
end
of
the
street
was
the
refuge
to
which
he
had
gone
he
walked
up
to
it
and
recognized
it
as
a
booth
barrent
entered
the
booth
it
was
small
and
there
was
a
faint
odor
of
incense
in
the
air
the
room
contained
a
single
chair
facing
it
was
a
complex
brilliantly
lighted
panel
good
morning
will
the
panel
said
to
him
barrent
had
a
sudden
sense
of
helplessness
when
he
heard
that
soft
mechanical
voice
he
remembered
it
now
the
passionless
voice
knew
all
understood
all
and
forgave
nothing
that
artfully
manufactured
voice
had
spoken
to
him
had
listened
and
then
had
judged
in
his
dream
he
had
personified
the
into
the
figure
of
a
human
judge
you
remember
me
barrent
asked
of
course
said
the
you
were
one
of
my
parishioners
before
you
went
to
omega
you
sent
me
there
for
the
crime
of
murder
but
i
did
commit
the
crime
barrent
said
i
did
do
it
and
you
must
have
known
it
of
course
i
knew
it
the
said
but
my
powers
and
duties
are
strictly
defined
i
sentence
according
to
evidence
not
intuition
by
law
the
must
weigh
only
the
concrete
evidence
which
is
put
before
them
they
must
when
in
doubt
sentence
in
fact
the
mere
presence
of
a
man
before
me
charged
with
murder
must
be
taken
as
a
strong
presumption
of
his
guilt
was
there
evidence
against
me
yes
who
gave
it
i
can
not
reveal
his
name
you
must
barrent
said
times
are
changing
on
earth
the
prisoners
are
coming
back
did
you
know
that
i
expected
it
the
said
i
must
have
the
informer
name
barrent
said
he
took
the
needlebeam
out
of
his
pocket
and
advanced
toward
the
panel
a
machine
can
not
be
coerced
the
told
him
give
me
the
name
barrent
shouted
i
should
not
for
your
own
good
the
danger
would
be
too
great
believe
me
will
the
name
very
well
you
will
find
the
informer
at
maple
street
but
i
earnestly
advise
you
not
to
go
there
you
will
be
killed
you
simply
do
not
know
barrent
pressed
the
trigger
and
the
narrow
beam
scythed
through
the
panel
lights
flashed
and
faded
as
he
cut
through
the
intricate
wiring
at
last
all
the
lights
were
dead
and
a
faint
gray
smoke
came
from
the
panel
barrent
left
the
booth
he
put
the
needlebeam
back
in
his
pocket
and
walked
to
maple
street
he
had
been
here
before
he
knew
this
street
set
upon
a
hill
rising
steeply
between
oak
and
maple
trees
those
lampposts
were
old
friends
that
crack
in
the
pavement
was
an
ancient
landmark
here
were
the
houses
heavy
with
familiarity
they
seemed
to
lean
expectantly
toward
him
like
spectators
waiting
for
the
final
act
of
an
almost
forgotten
drama
he
stood
in
front
of
maple
street
the
silence
which
surrounded
that
plain
house
struck
him
as
ominous
he
took
the
needlebeam
out
of
his
pocket
looking
for
a
reassurance
he
knew
he
could
not
find
then
he
walked
up
the
neat
flagstones
and
tried
the
front
door
it
opened
he
stepped
inside
he
made
out
the
dim
shades
of
lamps
and
furniture
the
dull
gleam
of
a
painting
on
the
wall
a
piece
of
statuary
on
an
ebony
pedestal
needlebeam
in
hand
he
stepped
into
the
next
room
and
came
face
to
face
with
the
informer
staring
at
the
informer
face
barrent
remembered
in
an
overpowering
flood
of
memory
he
saw
himself
a
little
boy
entering
the
closed
classroom
he
heard
again
the
soothing
hum
of
machinery
watched
the
pretty
lights
blink
and
flash
heard
the
insinuating
machine
voice
whisper
in
his
ear
at
first
the
voice
filled
him
with
horror
what
it
suggested
was
unthinkable
then
slowly
he
became
accustomed
to
it
and
accustomed
to
all
the
strange
things
that
happened
in
the
closed
classroom
he
the
machines
taught
on
deep
unconscious
levels
the
machines
intertwined
their
lessons
with
the
basic
drives
weaving
a
pattern
of
learned
behavior
with
the
life
instinct
they
taught
then
blocked
off
conscious
knowledge
of
the
lessons
sealed
it
and
fused
it
what
had
he
been
taught
the
social
good
you
must
be
your
own
policeman
and
witness
you
must
assume
responsibility
for
any
crime
which
might
conceivably
be
the
face
of
the
informer
stared
impassively
at
him
it
was
barrent
own
face
reflected
back
from
a
mirror
on
the
wall
he
had
informed
on
himself
standing
with
the
gun
in
his
hand
that
day
looking
down
at
the
murdered
man
learned
unconscious
processes
had
taken
over
the
presumption
of
guilt
had
been
too
great
for
him
to
resist
the
similarity
to
guilt
had
turned
into
guilt
itself
he
had
walked
to
the
booth
and
there
he
had
given
complete
and
damning
evidence
against
himself
had
indicted
himself
on
the
basis
of
probability
the
had
passed
the
obligatory
sentence
and
barrent
had
left
the
booth
in
the
lessons
of
the
classroom
he
had
taken
himself
into
custody
had
gone
to
the
nearest
center
in
trenton
already
a
partial
amnesia
had
taken
place
keyed
to
and
triggered
by
the
lessons
of
the
closed
classroom
the
skilled
android
technicians
in
the
center
had
labored
hard
to
complete
this
amnesia
to
obliterate
any
remnants
of
memory
as
a
standard
safeguard
against
any
possible
recovering
of
his
memory
they
had
implanted
a
logical
construct
of
his
crime
beneath
the
conscious
level
as
the
regulations
required
this
construct
contained
an
implication
of
the
power
of
earth
when
the
job
was
completed
an
automatized
barrent
had
marched
out
of
the
center
taken
a
special
expressway
to
the
prison
ship
depot
boarded
the
prison
ship
entered
his
cell
and
closed
the
door
and
left
earth
behind
him
then
he
had
slept
until
the
checkpoint
had
been
passed
after
which
the
newly
arrived
guards
awakened
the
prisoners
for
disembarkation
on
omega
now
staring
at
his
own
face
in
the
mirror
the
last
of
the
conscious
lessons
of
the
classroom
became
conscious
lessons
of
the
closed
classroom
must
never
be
consciously
known
by
the
individual
if
they
become
conscious
the
human
organism
must
perform
an
immediate
act
of
now
he
saw
why
his
conquest
of
earth
had
been
so
easy
it
was
because
he
had
conquered
nothing
earth
needed
no
security
forces
for
the
policeman
and
the
executioner
were
implanted
in
every
man
mind
beneath
the
surface
of
earth
mild
and
pleasant
culture
was
a
robot
civilization
an
awareness
of
that
civilization
was
punishable
by
death
and
here
at
this
moment
the
real
struggle
for
earth
began
learned
behavior
patterns
intertwined
with
basic
life
drives
forced
barrent
to
raise
the
needlebeam
to
point
it
toward
his
head
this
was
what
the
had
tried
to
warn
him
about
and
what
the
mutant
girl
had
skrenned
the
younger
barrent
conditioned
to
absolute
and
mindless
conformity
had
to
kill
himself
the
older
barrent
who
had
spent
time
on
omega
fought
that
blind
urge
a
schizophrenic
barrent
fought
himself
the
two
parts
of
him
battled
for
possession
of
the
weapon
for
control
of
the
body
for
ownership
of
the
mind
the
needlebeam
movement
stopped
inches
from
his
head
the
muzzle
wavered
then
slowly
the
new
omegan
barrent
forced
the
weapon
away
his
victory
was
for
now
the
lessons
of
the
closed
classroom
took
over
forcing
into
a
contrasurvival
struggle
with
the
implacable
and
chapter
thirty
conditioning
took
over
and
flung
the
fighting
barrents
backward
through
subjective
time
to
those
stress
points
in
the
past
where
death
had
been
near
where
the
temporal
life
fabric
had
been
weakened
where
a
predisposition
toward
death
had
already
been
established
conditioning
forced
to
those
moments
but
this
time
the
danger
was
augmented
by
the
full
force
of
the
malignant
half
of
his
personality
by
the
murderous
informer
stood
under
glaring
lights
on
the
sands
of
the
arena
a
sword
in
his
hand
it
was
the
time
of
the
omegan
games
coming
at
him
was
the
saunus
a
heavily
armored
reptile
with
the
leering
face
of
severed
the
creature
tail
and
it
changed
into
three
trichomotreds
with
the
dispositions
of
rabid
wolverines
he
killed
two
and
the
third
grinned
and
bit
his
left
hand
to
the
bone
he
killed
it
and
watched
blood
leak
into
the
soggy
sand
three
ragged
men
sat
laughing
on
a
bench
and
a
girl
handed
him
a
small
gun
luck
she
said
i
hope
you
know
how
to
use
this
barrent
nodded
his
thanks
before
he
noticed
that
the
girl
was
not
moera
she
was
the
skrenning
mutant
who
had
predicted
his
death
still
he
moved
into
the
street
and
faced
the
three
hadjis
two
of
the
men
were
strangers
the
third
stepped
forward
and
quickly
brought
his
gun
into
firing
position
flung
himself
to
the
ground
and
pressed
the
trigger
of
his
unfamiliar
weapon
he
felt
it
vibrate
in
his
hand
and
saw
hadji
barrent
head
and
shoulders
turn
black
and
begin
to
crumble
before
he
could
take
aim
again
his
gun
was
wrenched
violently
from
his
hand
dying
shot
had
creased
the
end
of
the
muzzle
desperately
he
dived
for
the
weapon
and
as
he
rolled
toward
it
he
saw
the
second
man
now
wearing
the
face
take
careful
aim
felt
pain
flash
through
his
arm
already
torn
by
the
trichomotred
teeth
he
managed
to
shoot
this
and
through
a
haze
of
pain
faced
the
third
man
now
also
his
arm
was
stiffening
rapidly
but
he
forced
himself
to
press
the
trigger
playing
their
told
himself
the
will
wear
you
down
will
kill
you
must
see
through
it
get
past
it
it
is
really
happening
it
in
your
but
there
was
no
time
to
think
he
was
in
a
large
circular
room
of
stone
in
the
cellars
of
the
department
of
justice
it
was
the
trial
by
ordeal
rolling
across
the
floor
toward
him
was
a
glistening
black
machine
shaped
like
a
standing
almost
four
feet
high
it
came
at
him
and
in
the
pattern
of
red
green
and
amber
lights
he
could
see
the
hated
face
of
now
his
enemy
was
in
its
ultimate
form
the
invariant
robot
consciousness
as
false
and
stylized
as
the
conditioned
dreams
of
earth
the
machine
extruded
a
single
slender
tentacle
with
a
white
light
winking
at
the
end
of
it
as
it
approached
the
tentacle
withdrew
and
in
its
place
appeared
a
jointed
metal
arm
ending
in
a
dodged
and
heard
the
knife
scrape
against
the
stone
is
what
you
think
it
told
himself
is
a
machine
and
you
are
not
back
on
omega
this
is
only
half
of
yourself
you
are
fighting
this
is
nothing
but
a
deadly
but
he
could
believe
it
the
barrent
machine
was
coming
at
him
again
its
metal
hide
glistening
with
a
foul
green
substance
which
recognized
immediately
as
contact
poison
he
broke
into
a
sprint
trying
to
stay
away
from
the
fatal
touch
is
he
told
himself
neutralizer
washed
over
the
metal
surface
clearing
away
the
poison
the
machine
tried
to
ram
him
barrent
tried
to
push
it
aside
it
crashed
into
him
with
stunning
force
and
he
could
feel
ribs
splintering
is
real
you
letting
a
conditioned
reflex
talk
you
to
death
you
are
on
omega
you
on
earth
in
your
own
home
staring
into
a
mirror
but
the
pain
was
real
and
the
clubbed
metal
arm
felt
real
as
it
crashed
against
his
shoulder
barrent
staggered
away
he
felt
horror
not
at
dying
but
at
dying
too
soon
before
he
could
warn
the
omegans
of
this
ultimate
danger
planted
deep
in
their
own
minds
there
was
no
one
else
to
warn
of
the
catastrophe
that
would
strike
each
man
as
he
recovered
his
own
specific
memories
of
earth
to
his
best
knowledge
no
one
had
experienced
this
and
lived
if
could
live
through
it
countermeasures
could
be
taken
counterconditioning
could
be
set
up
he
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
coached
since
childhood
in
social
responsibility
he
thought
of
it
now
he
could
allow
himself
to
die
when
his
knowledge
was
vital
to
omega
is
not
a
real
he
repeated
it
to
himself
as
the
barrent
machine
revved
up
picked
up
speed
and
hurtled
toward
him
from
the
far
side
of
the
room
he
forced
himself
to
see
beyond
the
machine
to
see
the
patient
droning
lessons
of
the
classroom
which
had
created
this
monster
in
his
mind
is
not
a
real
he
believed
it
and
swung
his
fist
into
the
hated
face
reflected
in
the
metal
there
was
a
moment
of
dazzling
pain
and
then
he
lost
consciousness
when
he
came
to
he
was
alone
in
his
own
home
on
earth
his
arm
and
shoulder
ached
and
several
of
his
ribs
seemed
to
be
broken
on
his
left
hand
he
bore
the
stigmata
of
the
trichomotred
bite
but
with
his
cut
and
bleeding
right
hand
he
had
smashed
the

he
had
shattered
