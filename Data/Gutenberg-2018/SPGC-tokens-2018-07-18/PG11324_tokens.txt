this
is
the
end
by
stella
benson
this
is
the
end
for
the
moment
of
all
my
thinking
this
is
my
unfinal
conclusion
there
is
no
reason
in
tangible
things
and
no
system
in
the
ordinary
ways
of
the
world
hands
were
made
to
grope
and
feet
to
stumble
and
the
only
things
you
may
count
on
are
the
unaccountable
things
system
is
a
fairy
and
a
dream
you
never
find
system
where
or
when
you
expect
it
there
are
no
reasons
except
reasons
you
and
i
do
know
i
should
not
be
really
surprised
if
the
policeman
across
the
way
grew
wings
or
if
the
deep
sea
rose
and
washed
out
the
chaos
of
the
land
i
should
not
raise
my
eyebrows
if
the
daily
press
became
the
little
sunbeam
of
the
home
or
if
cabinet
ministers
struck
for
a
decrease
of
wages
i
feel
no
security
in
facts
precedent
seems
no
protection
to
me
the
wisdom
you
can
find
in
an
encyclopedia
or
in
selfridge
information
bureau
seems
to
me
just
a
transitory
adaptation
to
quicksand
circumstances
but
if
the
things
which
i
know
in
spite
of
my
education
were
false
if
the
eyes
of
the
sea
forgot
their
secret
or
if
the
accent
of
the
steep
woods
became
vulgar
if
the
fairy
adventures
that
happen
in
my
heart
fell
flat
if
the
good
friends
my
eyes
have
never
seen
failed
me
then
indeed
should
i
know
emptiness
and
an
astonishment
that
would
kill
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
jay
a
and
an
idealist
she
is
not
the
heroine
but
the
most
constantly
apparent
woman
in
this
book
i
can
not
introduce
you
to
a
heroine
because
i
have
never
met
one
she
was
a
person
who
took
nothing
in
the
world
for
granted
but
as
she
had
only
a
slight
connection
with
the
world
that
is
not
saying
very
much
her
answer
to
everything
was
why
the
fundamental
facts
that
you
and
i
accept
from
our
youth
upwards
like
be
good
and
you
will
be
happy
or
change
your
boots
when
you
come
in
out
of
the
wet
or
respect
your
elders
or
love
your
neighbour
or
never
cross
your
legs
above
the
knee
did
not
impress
jay
i
never
knew
her
as
a
baby
but
i
am
sure
she
must
have
been
born
a
propounder
of
questions
and
a
smiler
at
the
answers
she
received
i
daresay
she
used
to
ask
questions
without
result
long
before
she
could
talk
but
i
am
quite
sure
she
was
not
embittered
by
the
lack
of
result
nothing
ever
embittered
jay
not
even
her
own
pessimism
there
is
a
finality
about
bitterness
and
jay
was
never
final
her
last
word
was
always
on
a
questioning
note
her
mind
was
always
open
waiting
for
more
oh
no
she
would
tell
her
pillow
at
night
there
must
be
a
better
answer
than
that
perhaps
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
she
had
quarrelled
with
her
family
and
run
away
from
home
her
family
knew
neither
what
she
was
doing
nor
where
she
was
doing
it
families
are
incurably
conceited
and
this
one
supposed
that
having
broken
away
from
it
jay
was
going
to
the
bad
on
the
contrary
she
was
a
but
i
only
tell
you
this
in
confidence
i
repeat
the
family
did
not
know
it
and
does
not
know
it
yet
the
family
sometimes
said
that
jay
was
an
idealist
but
it
did
not
really
think
so
the
family
sometimes
said
that
she
was
rather
mad
but
it
did
not
know
how
mad
she
was
or
it
would
have
sent
her
away
to
live
in
a
doctor
establishment
at
margate
it
never
realised
that
it
had
only
come
in
contact
with
about
of
its
young
relation
and
that
the
other
were
shut
away
from
it
shut
away
in
a
shining
bubble
world
with
only
room
in
it
for
one
for
one
and
a
shining
bubble
story
i
do
not
know
how
universal
an
experience
a
secret
story
and
a
secret
friend
may
be
perhaps
this
wonder
is
a
commonplace
to
you
only
you
are
more
reticent
about
it
than
jay
or
i
but
to
me
even
after
twenty
intimacy
with
what
i
can
only
describe
as
a
supplementary
life
that
i
can
not
describe
it
still
seems
so
very
wonderful
that
i
can
not
believe
i
share
it
with
every
man
and
woman
in
the
street
the
great
advantage
of
a
secret
story
over
other
stories
is
that
you
can
not
put
it
into
print
so
i
can
only
show
you
the
initial
letter
and
you
may
if
you
choose
look
upon
it
as
an
imaginary
hieroglyphic
or
you
may
not
just
this
that
a
bubble
world
can
contain
a
round
and
russet
horizon
of
high
woods
which
you
can
attain
and
from
the
horizon
a
long
view
of
an
unending
sea
you
can
run
down
across
the
dappled
fields
you
can
run
down
into
the
cove
and
stroke
the
sea
and
hear
the
intimate
minor
singing
of
it
and
when
you
feel
as
strong
as
the
morning
you
can
shout
and
run
against
the
wind
against
the
flying
sand
that
never
blows
above
your
knees
and
when
you
feel
as
tired
as
the
night
you
can
climb
slowly
up
the
cliff
path
and
go
into
the
house
the
house
you
know
much
better
than
any
house
your
ordinary
eyes
have
seen
and
there
you
will
find
your
secret
friends
the
best
part
about
secret
friends
is
that
they
will
never
weary
you
by
knowing
you
you
share
their
house
your
passing
hand
helps
to
polish
the
base
of
that
wooden
figure
that
ends
the
banisters
you
know
the
childish
delight
of
that
wide
short
chimney
in
the
big
turret
room
a
chimney
so
wide
and
so
short
that
you
can
stand
inside
the
great
crooked
fireplace
and
whisper
to
the
birds
that
look
down
from
the
edge
of
the
chimney
only
a
yard
or
two
above
you
you
know
how
comfy
those
big
beds
are
you
sit
at
the
long
clothless
table
in
the
brown
with
all
these
things
you
are
intimate
and
yet
you
pass
through
the
place
as
a
ghost
your
bubble
enchantment
encloses
you
your
secret
friends
have
no
knowledge
of
you
their
story
runs
without
you
your
unnecessary
identity
is
tactfully
ignored
and
you
know
the
heaven
of
being
dispassionate
and
detached
among
things
you
love
all
these
things
can
a
bubble
world
contain
you
have
to
get
inside
things
to
find
out
how
limitless
they
are
and
i
think
if
you
believe
it
all
it
is
none
the
less
true
for
that
because
in
that
case
you
are
the
sort
of
person
who
believes
a
thing
less
the
truer
it
is
if
jay
family
did
not
know
she
was
a
and
did
not
know
she
was
a
what
did
it
know
about
her
it
knew
she
disliked
the
smell
of
bananas
and
that
she
had
not
taken
advantage
of
an
expensive
education
and
that
she
was
stock
size
small
ladies
and
that
she
was
christened
jane
elizabeth
and
that
she
took
after
her
father
to
an
excessive
extent
and
that
she
was
rather
too
apt
to
swallow
this
socialist
nonsense
as
families
go
it
was
fairly
well
informed
about
her
the
family
was
a
rather
promiscuous
one
it
had
more
tortuous
relationships
than
most
families
have
although
there
were
only
four
in
it
not
counting
russell
i
might
as
well
introduce
you
to
the
family
before
i
settle
down
to
the
story
from
careful
study
of
the
press
reviews
i
gather
that
a
story
is
considered
a
necessary
thing
in
a
novel
so
this
time
i
am
going
to
try
and
include
one
you
may
if
you
please
meet
the
family
after
breakfast
at
house
in
kensington
about
three
months
after
jay
had
run
away
there
were
four
people
in
the
room
they
were
cousin
gustus
gustus
kew
and
russell
it
behoves
me
to
try
and
tell
you
very
simply
about
gustus
because
she
prided
herself
on
simplicity
spelt
with
a
capital
s
it
constituted
her
deity
her
heaven
was
a
severe
and
shadowless
eternity
and
plain
words
were
the
flowers
that
grew
in
her
elysian
fields
she
had
simplified
her
life
and
her
looks
even
her
smile
was
shorn
of
all
accessories
like
dimples
or
twinkles
her
hair
which
was
not
abundant
was
the
colour
of
corn
straight
and
shining
her
eyes
were
a
cold
dark
grey
now
to
be
simple
is
all
very
well
but
turn
it
into
an
active
verb
and
you
spoil
the
whole
idea
to
simplify
seems
forced
and
i
think
gustus
struck
harder
on
the
note
of
simplification
than
that
of
simplicity
i
should
not
dare
to
criticise
her
however
and
cousin
gustus
was
satisfied
so
criticism
in
any
case
would
be
intrusive
it
is
just
possible
that
he
occasionally
wished
that
she
would
dress
herself
in
a
more
human
way
patronise
in
winter
the
humble
viyella
stripe
for
instance
or
in
summer
the
flippant
sprig
but
a
large
proportion
of
gustus
faith
was
founded
on
simple
strong
colours
in
wide
expanses
introduced
as
it
were
one
to
another
by
judicious
black
anybody
but
gustus
would
have
been
drowned
in
her
clothes
but
she
was
conceived
on
a
generous
scale
she
was
almost
gorgeous
she
barely
missed
exaggeration
in
her
manner
i
think
she
did
not
miss
it
she
had
therefore
the
gift
of
coping
with
colour
it
remains
for
me
to
add
that
her
age
was
and
that
she
was
a
novelist
the
recording
angel
had
probably
noted
the
fact
of
her
novelism
among
her
virtues
but
she
had
an
imperceptible
earthly
public
she
wrote
laborious
books
full
of
short
peevish
sentences
of
such
very
pure
construction
that
they
were
extremely
difficult
to
understand
she
wore
spectacles
with
aggressive
rims
she
said
i
am
i
am
obliged
to
wear
spectacles
why
should
i
try
to
conceal
the
fact
i
will
not
have
a
pair
of
rimless
ghosts
haunting
my
face
i
will
wear
spectacles
without
shame
but
the
real
truth
was
that
the
rims
were
more
becoming
to
her
gustus
was
known
to
her
husband
family
as
anonyma
the
origin
of
this
habit
was
an
old
joke
and
i
have
forgotten
the
point
of
it
cousin
gustus
was
second
cousin
once
removed
to
kew
and
kew
sister
jay
and
had
kindly
brought
them
up
from
childhood
he
was
now
at
the
further
end
of
the
sixties
and
embittered
by
many
things
an
unsuitable
marriage
the
approach
of
the
psalmist
incurably
modern
surroundings
an
internal
complaint
and
a
haunting
wish
to
relieve
the
government
of
the
management
of
the
war
these
drawbacks
were
to
a
certain
extent
linked
they
accounted
for
each
other
the
complaint
hindered
him
from
offering
his
services
as
secretary
of
state
it
made
of
him
a
slave
so
he
could
not
pretend
to
be
a
master
he
cherished
his
slavery
for
it
happened
to
be
painless
and
supplied
him
with
a
certain
dignity
which
would
otherwise
have
been
difficult
to
secure
during
the
summer
the
complaint
hibernated
and
ceased
to
interest
either
doctors
or
relations
which
was
naturally
hard
to
bear
to
these
trials
you
may
add
the
disgraceful
behaviour
of
his
young
cousin
jay
and
admit
that
cousin
gustus
had
every
excuse
for
encouraging
pessimism
of
the
most
pronounced
type
jay
brother
kew
was
and
from
this
it
follows
that
he
had
already
drunk
the
surprising
beverage
of
war
his
military
history
included
a
little
splinter
of
hate
in
the
left
shoulder
followed
by
a
depressing
period
almost
entirely
spent
in
the
society
of
medical
boards
three
months
of
light
duty
consisting
of
weary
instruction
of
fools
in
an
east
coast
town
and
now
an
interval
of
leave
at
the
end
of
which
the
battalion
to
which
he
had
lately
been
attached
hoped
to
go
to
france
in
one
way
it
was
a
pity
he
ever
joined
the
army
for
khaki
clashed
badly
with
most
of
gustus
colour
theories
but
he
had
never
noticed
that
his
eye
and
his
ear
and
his
mind
were
all
equally
slow
to
appreciate
clashings
of
any
kind
he
was
rather
aloof
from
comparison
and
criticism
but
not
on
principle
he
had
no
principles
at
least
no
original
ones
just
the
ordinary
stuffy
old
principles
of
decency
and
all
that
he
never
turned
his
eyes
inward
as
far
as
the
could
see
he
lived
a
breezy
life
outside
himself
he
never
tried
to
make
a
fine
kew
of
himself
he
never
propounded
riddles
to
his
creator
which
is
the
way
most
of
us
make
our
reputations
russell
the
host
and
adopted
member
of
the
family
was
he
did
not
know
jay
having
only
lately
been
culled
by
gustus
that
assiduous
collector
and
placed
in
the
bosom
of
the
family
she
had
found
him
blossoming
unloved
in
the
wilderness
of
a
war
work
committee
he
was
well
informed
yet
a
good
listener
perhaps
he
possessed
both
these
virtues
to
excess
at
any
rate
gustus
had
decided
that
he
was
worthy
of
family
friendship
and
being
naturally
extravagant
she
conferred
it
upon
him
with
both
hands
russell
was
married
to
a
woman
who
had
not
properly
realised
the
fact
that
she
was
russell
she
spent
her
life
in
distant
lands
helping
the
world
to
become
better
at
present
she
was
understood
to
be
propagating
peace
in
the
united
states
and
was
never
mentioned
by
or
to
her
husband
my
first
impression
of
russell
was
that
he
was
rather
fat
but
i
never
could
trace
this
impression
to
its
origin
he
had
not
exactly
a
double
chin
but
rather
a
chin
and
a
half
and
the
rest
of
him
followed
this
moderate
example
his
grey
hair
retired
in
a
pronounced
estuary
over
each
temple
leaving
a
beautifully
brushed
peninsula
between
he
had
no
sense
of
humour
but
hid
this
deformity
skillfully
hardly
anybody
knew
that
he
was
a
poet
except
presumably
his
dog
he
often
talked
to
his
dog
he
told
it
every
speakable
thought
that
he
had
this
was
his
only
bad
habit
occasionally
his
dog
was
heard
to
reply
in
a
small
curious
voice
proceeding
also
from
russell
these
four
people
looked
out
at
kensington
gardens
which
were
rejoicing
in
the
very
babyhood
of
the
year
the
naked
trees
were
like
pillars
in
the
mist
the
grass
was
grey
and
whitened
to
the
distance
the
world
had
mislaid
its
horizon
and
one
eye
slid
up
without
check
between
the
trees
to
where
the
last
word
of
a
daylight
moon
whispered
in
the
sky
i
glory
in
a
view
that
dispenses
with
colour
said
gustus
severely
she
always
spoke
as
though
she
were
sure
of
the
whole
of
what
she
intended
to
say
when
she
did
hesitate
it
only
meant
that
she
was
seeking
for
the
simplest
word
and
she
would
cap
her
pause
with
a
monosyllable
as
curt
as
an
explosion
but
glory
is
the
right
word
i
think
for
london
in
some
moods
do
you
know
the
feeling
of
a
heart
beating
too
high
when
you
see
the
great
cliffs
of
london
under
rain
or
vague
sunshine
or
rising
out
of
yellow
air
do
you
ever
want
as
i
do
to
stand
with
arms
out
against
the
london
wind
and
shout
your
own
unmade
poetry
on
the
top
of
a
with
this
sort
of
grotesque
glorying
does
london
inspire
me
so
that
i
spend
whole
days
together
feeling
that
the
essential
is
too
big
for
what
encloses
it
anonyma
never
felt
like
this
she
often
spoke
the
right
word
but
she
nearly
always
spoke
it
coldly
this
morning
said
kew
when
i
looked
out
i
felt
the
futility
of
bed
so
i
made
an
assignation
with
the
hound
when
i
met
it
trooping
along
with
russ
in
single
file
to
the
bathroom
why
does
your
hound
always
accompany
you
there
russ
dogs
must
think
us
awfully
irrational
beasts
and
yet
does
that
hound
really
think
you
could
elope
for
ever
and
be
no
more
seen
with
nothing
on
but
pyjamas
and
a
towel
i
suppose
he
thinks
ca
be
too
careful
it
makes
one
humble
to
live
with
a
dog
i
always
blush
when
i
see
a
dog
dreaming
because
i
afraid
they
give
us
an
undignified
place
in
their
dreams
your
hound
russ
dreams
of
you
plunging
into
the
serpentine
after
a
canadian
goose
with
your
topper
floating
behind
you
or
anonyma
with
her
tongue
hanging
out
scratching
at
a
little
mousehole
in
piccadilly
it
is
humiliating
is
it
anyway
before
breakfast
russ
hound
and
i
went
and
jumped
over
things
in
the
gardens
the
mistook
us
for
young
lambs
russell
hound
was
called
so
by
courtesy
in
order
to
lend
him
a
dignity
which
he
lacked
he
may
have
been
twelve
inches
high
at
the
shoulder
and
he
thought
that
he
was
exactly
like
a
lion
except
for
a
trifling
difference
in
size
dignity
is
not
of
course
incompatible
with
small
stature
but
i
think
it
was
the
twinkling
gait
of
russell
hound
that
robbed
him
of
moral
weight
and
prevented
you
from
attaching
great
importance
to
his
views
young
lambs
exclaimed
gustus
really
my
good
kew
had
you
nothing
better
to
do
not
at
that
time
replied
kew
you
were
up
and
he
sang
to
drown
her
sigh
kew
was
the
only
person
i
ever
knew
who
really
sang
to
the
tune
of
his
moods
he
sang
albert
hall
sort
of
music
very
loudly
when
he
was
happy
and
when
he
was
extremely
happy
he
roared
so
that
his
voice
broke
out
of
tune
when
he
was
silent
it
was
almost
always
because
he
was
asleep
or
because
some
other
member
of
the
family
was
talking
when
by
some
accident
the
whole
family
was
simultaneously
silent
you
could
not
help
noticing
what
an
oppressively
still
place
london
was
the
sound
of
russell
hound
sneezing
in
the
hall
was
like
a
bomb
but
at
the
present
moment
kew
only
sang
a
few
bars
of
beethoven
in
a
small
voice
he
was
rather
sad
because
of
jay
he
had
not
realised
till
he
came
home
how
very
thoroughly
jay
had
disappeared
he
led
the
conversation
to
jay
it
often
happened
that
kew
led
conversations
because
conversations
like
the
public
generally
follow
the
loudest
voice
why
so
sudden
asked
kew
apparently
of
the
round
pond
so
loud
was
his
voice
that
what
i
ca
make
out
she
used
to
be
such
a
human
sort
and
anybody
with
half
an
ear
could
hear
the
decisions
bubbling
about
under
the
lid
for
weeks
before
they
boiled
over
everybody
even
cousin
gustus
knew
that
he
was
talking
of
jay
kew
said
so
much
that
he
might
be
excused
for
forgetting
occasionally
what
he
had
not
said
besides
he
had
talked
of
little
else
but
jay
since
he
rejoined
his
family
two
days
before
she
used
to
be
a
good
girl
sighed
cousin
gustus
so
few
girls
are
good
cousin
gustus
is
an
expert
pessimist
vice
accidents
and
terrible
ends
are
his
speciality
all
virtue
is
to
him
an
exception
and
by
him
is
immediately
forgotten
in
sudden
deaths
you
can
not
catch
him
out
if
you
were
tossed
from
the
horns
of
a
bull
into
the
jaws
of
a
crocodile
and
died
of
pneumonia
contracted
during
the
flight
you
would
not
surprise
cousin
gustus
he
is
never
at
a
loss
for
a
precedent
the
only
way
you
could
really
astonish
him
would
be
by
living
a
blameless
life
without
adventure
and
dying
of
old
age
in
your
bed
there
were
warnings
said
anonyma
little
disagreements
with
gustus
she
wanted
to
bring
vermin
into
the
house
mourned
cousin
gustus
kew
suggested
white
mice
not
vermin
unattended
anonyma
explained
she
wanted
to
adopt
brown
borough
babies
she
had
been
working
desultorily
in
the
brown
borough
since
war
broke
out
that
might
explain
the
peculiar
and
remark
in
her
letter
to
you
that
she
would
settle
in
no
home
except
the
perfect
home
i
hate
things
in
capital
letters
why
did
she
get
married
grumbled
cousin
gustus
she
was
engaged
for
nearly
three
weeks
to
young
william
morgan
a
most
respectable
young
man
so
few
young
men
she
wrote
to
me
that
she
could
keep
up
that
engagement
said
kew
not
even
by
looking
upon
it
as
war
work
she
called
him
a
young
man
and
that
again
seemed
unlike
her
she
use
to
mind
surfaceness
the
war
seems
to
have
turned
her
upside
down
but
then
of
course
the
war
has
turned
us
all
upside
down
and
in
that
position
you
generally
get
a
rush
of
brains
to
the
head
we
all
feverish
that
what
the
matter
with
us
when
i
was
in
hospital
i
lived
for
three
weeks
on
the
top
of
a
high
temperature
laughing
i
want
to
laugh
now
it
a
damn
funny
world
i
once
knew
a
man
who
died
of
apoplexy
while
swearing
sniffed
cousin
gustus
you
have
been
damned
unlucky
in
your
friends
cousin
gustus
said
kew
he
paused
and
then
added
besides
i
hardly
ever
say
damn
without
saying
to
myself
afterwards
it
seems
a
pity
to
waste
a
precious
word
on
an
inadequate
cause
and
i
always
retrieve
it
if
i
can
before
you
came
down
to
breakfast
this
morning
kew
said
anonyma
we
had
an
idea
only
one
between
you
in
all
that
time
said
kew
i
was
half
an
hour
late
now
kew
be
an
angel
and
agree
with
the
idea
i
set
my
heart
on
it
said
gustus
when
gustus
talked
in
a
womanly
way
like
this
the
change
was
always
unmistakable
she
was
naturally
an
unnatural
talker
and
when
she
mentioned
such
natural
things
as
angels
you
knew
she
was
resorting
deliberately
to
womanly
charm
in
order
to
attain
her
end
there
was
something
very
about
anonyma
womanly
charm
good
lord
said
kew
i
wish
angels
had
never
been
invented
i
never
am
one
only
people
always
tell
me
to
be
one
i
never
get
officially
recognised
in
heaven
what
is
the
plan
there
is
russell
car
doing
nothing
began
gustus
do
you
mean
christina
interrupted
kew
shocked
at
such
formality
do
call
her
russell
car
it
sounds
so
cold
there
is
russell
christina
doing
nothing
compromised
anonyma
and
petrol
is
so
bad
as
it
will
be
and
it
a
beautiful
time
of
year
and
you
are
not
strong
yet
really
and
we
want
jay
back
a
procession
of
facts
does
make
a
plan
objected
kew
it
may
lead
to
one
eventually
said
gustus
oh
kew
i
want
to
go
out
into
the
country
i
want
to
thread
the
pale
spring
air
and
hear
the
lambs
cry
i
want
to
brush
my
face
against
the
grass
and
wade
in
a
wave
of
bluebells
i
want
to
forget
blood
and
belgians
and
kiss
nature
take
a
and
kiss
hampstead
heath
suggested
kew
the
spring
has
got
there
all
right
anonyma
behind
the
was
jotting
down
in
a
notebook
the
salient
points
in
her
outburst
she
always
placed
her
literary
calling
first
and
anyway
i
should
be
rather
proud
if
i
could
talk
like
that
about
the
spring
without
any
preparation
the
idea
originally
began
russell
tentatively
was
not
only
formed
to
allow
gustus
to
enjoy
the
spring
but
also
to
make
you
quite
strong
before
you
go
back
to
work
and
again
not
only
that
but
also
to
try
and
trace
your
sister
jay
will
you
please
imagine
that
continual
intercourse
with
very
talkative
people
had
made
russell
an
adept
at
vocal
compression
he
had
now
almost
lost
the
use
of
his
vowels
and
if
i
wrote
as
he
spoke
the
effect
would
be
like
an
advertisement
for
a
housemaid
during
the
shortage
of
i
spare
you
this
there
are
three
objections
to
the
plan
said
kew
first
that
anonyma
does
really
want
to
kiss
the
spring
second
that
i
really
want
convalescent
treatment
third
that
jay
does
really
want
to
be
traced
when
gustus
did
not
know
the
answer
to
an
objection
she
left
it
unanswered
this
is
of
course
the
simplest
way
she
snapped
her
notebook
oh
kew
she
said
you
promised
you
be
an
angel
the
double
row
of
buttons
down
her
breast
trembled
with
eagerness
angeller
and
angeller
sighed
kew
i
never
committed
myself
so
far
i
have
a
clue
with
which
to
trace
jay
said
gustus
i
had
a
letter
from
her
this
morning
kew
was
a
satisfactory
person
to
surprise
he
is
never
supercilious
you
heard
from
jay
he
said
in
a
voice
as
high
as
his
eyebrows
the
letter
which
gustus
showed
to
kew
may
be
quoted
here
this
place
has
stood
since
the
year
twelve
something
and
its
windows
look
down
without
even
the
interruption
of
a
sill
at
the
coming
and
going
of
the
tides
it
has
hardly
any
garden
and
immediately
to
the
right
and
the
left
of
it
the
green
down
brims
over
the
top
of
the
cliff
like
the
froth
of
ale
over
a
silver
goblet
the
tide
is
low
the
sea
is
golden
where
the
shallow
waves
break
upon
the
sand
and
ghostly
green
in
the
distance
when
the
tide
is
high
the
sound
and
the
sight
of
it
seem
to
meet
and
make
one
thing
the
waves
press
up
the
cliff
then
and
fall
back
on
each
other
do
you
know
the
lines
that
are
written
on
the
face
of
a
disappointed
wave
the
clouds
are
like
castles
built
on
the
plain
of
the
sea
there
is
an
aeroplane
at
this
moment
dim
as
a
little
thought
coming
between
two
turrets
of
cloud
i
suppose
it
is
that
i
can
hear
but
it
sounds
like
the
distant
singing
of
the
moon
i
have
come
here
to
count
up
my
theories
to
count
them
and
pile
them
up
like
money
in
heaps
according
to
their
value
theories
are
such
beautiful
things
there
must
be
some
use
in
them
or
perhaps
they
are
like
money
from
a
distant
country
and
not
in
currency
here
yet
just
as
sheer
metal
they
must
have
some
value
it
is
wonderful
that
such
happiness
should
come
to
me
and
that
it
should
last
i
have
the
sea
and
a
friend
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
i
lack
and
nothing
that
i
regret
what
better
clue
could
you
want
asked
gustus
we
will
take
christina
round
the
looking
for
silver
cliffs
and
a
golden
sea
sighed
kew
i
do
know
if
i
have
mentioned
or
conveyed
to
you
that
gustus
was
a
determined
woman
at
any
rate
she
was
and
it
would
therefore
be
waste
of
time
to
describe
the
gradual
defeat
of
kew
the
final
stage
was
the
despatch
of
kew
to
call
on
nana
in
the
brown
borough
jay
letter
had
the
brown
borough
postmark
so
it
had
apparently
been
sent
to
nana
to
post
nana
might
be
described
as
the
second
clue
in
the
pursuit
of
jay
she
was
the
family
only
link
with
jay
the
one
drawback
of
nana
as
a
clue
was
that
she
was
never
to
be
found
gustus
had
called
six
times
but
had
been
repulsed
on
each
occasion
by
a
totally
dumb
front
door
but
then
nana
never
had
liked
anonyma
nana
was
simple
herself
in
an
amateurish
unconscious
sort
of
way
and
i
expect
she
disliked
anonyma
professional
rivalry
in
the
matter
of
simplicity
but
kew
was
always
a
favourite
the
roared
up
the
canyons
of
the
city
and
its
voice
accompanied
kew
in
his
tuneful
meditations
a
is
not
really
well
adapted
for
meditation
on
my
feet
i
can
stride
across
unseen
miles
musing
on
love
in
a
taxi
i
can
think
about
dinner
but
on
a
my
thoughts
will
go
no
further
than
my
eyes
can
see
so
kew
although
he
thought
he
was
thinking
of
jay
was
really
considering
the
words
in
front
of
him
to
stop
strike
bell
at
rear
footnote
he
must
have
changed
at
the
bank
into
a
tilling
he
deduced
from
this
that
it
was
an
irish
and
supposed
that
this
accounted
for
its
rather
behaviour
he
spent
some
moments
in
imagining
the
macbus
child
of
a
sterner
race
which
would
run
gutturally
without
skids
and
wear
a
different
cut
of
bonnet
he
dismounted
into
a
faint
yellow
fog
diluted
with
a
faint
twilight
in
the
brown
borough
the
air
was
vague
making
it
not
so
much
an
impossibility
to
decipher
the
features
of
people
approaching
as
a
surprise
to
find
it
possible
a
few
rather
premature
bar
adapted
scripture
to
modern
conditions
by
hiding
their
light
under
tin
substitutes
for
bushels
in
the
hope
of
protecting
such
valuables
as
cat
meat
and
bananas
from
aerial
outrage
kew
pranced
over
prostrate
children
and
curved
about
the
pavement
to
avoid
artificially
vivacious
who
emerged
from
the
nana
lived
in
a
little
alley
which
was
like
a
fiord
of
peace
running
in
from
the
shrill
storm
of
the
brown
borough
here
little
cottages
shrank
together
passive
resisters
of
the
twentieth
century
low
crooked
windows
blinked
through
a
mask
of
dirty
creepers
each
little
front
garden
contained
a
shrub
and
was
guarded
by
a
low
railing
although
there
would
have
been
no
room
for
a
trespasser
in
addition
to
the
shrub
house
at
the
end
of
the
alley
looked
along
it
to
the
far
turmoil
of
the
kew
insulted
the
gate
as
usual
by
stepping
over
it
and
knocked
at
the
door
he
held
his
breath
so
that
he
might
more
keenly
hear
the
first
whisperings
of
the
floor
upstairs
which
would
show
that
nana
was
astir
a
gardenful
of
cats
came
and
told
him
that
his
hopes
were
vain
cats
only
exist
i
think
for
the
chastening
of
man
they
never
come
to
me
except
to
tell
me
the
worst
and
to
crush
me
with
quiet
sarcasm
should
my
optimism
survive
their
warning
but
before
the
cats
had
finished
speaking
there
was
a
most
sound
of
bounding
within
and
jay
appeared
she
threw
herself
out
of
the
darkness
of
the
door
on
to
the
twilit
kew
the
cats
were
ashamed
to
be
seen
watching
this
almost
canine
display
and
went
away
i
did
know
you
were
in
france
said
jay
to
kew
i
did
know
you
were
in
heaven
said
kew
to
jay
what
all
this
about
golden
seas
and
aeroplanes
snarling
around
oh
snarling
that
just
what
they
do
said
jay
let
pretend
i
said
that
it
seemed
as
if
childhood
turned
its
face
to
them
again
after
a
thousand
years
these
roaring
months
of
war
run
like
a
sea
between
us
and
our
peaceful
beginnings
so
that
a
catchword
flashed
across
out
of
our
past
is
as
beautiful
and
as
incredible
as
the
light
in
a
dream
when
they
were
little
they
used
to
bargain
for
expressive
words
their
childhood
was
full
of
such
as
if
you
tell
how
we
said
to
the
milkman
you
must
let
me
have
the
old
lady
who
had
a
palpitation
and
puffocated
running
after
the
they
were
not
spontaneous
people
they
were
born
with
too
great
a
love
of
words
a
passion
for
drama
at
the
expense
of
truth
and
a
habit
of
overweighting
common
life
with
romance
it
was
perhaps
good
for
them
to
have
acquired
such
a
very
simple
relation
by
marriage
as
anonyma
about
the
sea
said
jay
i
tell
you
later
well
tell
me
first
why
you
found
home
so
suddenly
unbearable
stood
it
for
eighteen
years
i
been
a
child
all
through
those
eighteen
years
and
to
a
child
just
the
fact
of
is
so
admirable
i
wonder
why
but
under
the
fierce
light
that
beats
from
the
eye
of
a
woman
suddenly
and
violently
grown
old
cousin
gustus
and
anonyma
do
well
kew
do
they
the
dusk
filled
the
room
as
water
fills
a
cup
and
to
look
up
at
the
light
of
an
outside
lamp
on
the
ceiling
was
like
looking
up
through
water
at
the
surface
jay
wore
a
dress
of
the
same
colour
of
the
dusk
and
her
round
face
faint
as
a
bubble
seemed
to
float
on
its
background
unsupported
did
you
think
about
adopting
a
baby
suggested
kew
that
evidently
put
cousin
gustus
back
up
i
did
put
cousin
gustus
back
up
so
high
as
he
put
mine
answered
jay
oh
kew
what
are
the
old
that
they
should
check
us
what
the
use
of
this
war
of
one
generation
against
another
old
people
and
young
people
reach
a
deadlock
that
as
bad
as
marriage
without
the
possibility
of
divorce
is
all
forced
fidelity
wrong
what
did
you
do
tell
me
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
oh
well
i
felt
something
like
frost
in
the
air
and
i
could
define
it
really
it
was
work
waiting
to
be
done
not
work
for
the
poor
but
work
with
the
poor
at
home
i
talked
about
work
and
anonyma
wrote
about
it
and
cousin
gustus
shuddered
at
it
you
were
doing
it
all
right
but
where
was
i
three
days
a
week
with
soldiers
wives
my
brow
never
sweated
a
drop
i
thought
there
must
be
something
better
than
a
view
of
work
so
i
took
a
job
at
a
bolster
place
oh
well
it
does
matter
now
i
earned
ten
shillings
a
week
and
paid
for
a
little
basement
back
on
saturdays
i
got
my
sunday
clothes
out
of
pawn
and
came
to
tea
with
nana
do
you
remember
the
scones
and
the
welsh
rarebit
that
nana
used
to
make
i
believe
those
things
were
worth
the
terror
of
the
pawnshop
oh
kew
those
pawnshops
those
little
secret
stalls
that
put
shame
into
you
where
none
was
before
the
pawn
man
why
is
it
that
when
you
already
frightened
is
the
moment
that
men
choose
to
frighten
you
because
weakness
is
the
worst
crime
that
i
have
proved
my
work
was
putting
fluff
into
bolsters
there
was
a
big
bright
grocers
calendar
the
death
of
nelson
and
if
i
could
see
it
through
the
fog
of
fluff
i
felt
that
was
a
lucky
day
i
had
to
eat
my
lunch
there
raspberry
jam
sandwiches
not
fruit
jam
you
know
but
raspberry
flavour
it
was
nice
and
it
used
to
get
fluffy
in
that
air
the
others
sat
round
and
munched
and
picked
their
teeth
and
read
jew
newspapers
have
you
ever
noticed
that
whichever
way
up
you
look
at
a
jew
newspaper
you
always
feel
as
if
you
could
read
it
better
if
you
were
standing
on
your
head
my
governor
was
a
jew
too
he
was
bad
but
he
looked
wet
and
his
hair
was
a
horror
to
me
his
voice
was
tired
of
dealing
with
fluff
though
he
did
deal
with
it
so
intimately
as
we
did
and
it
only
allowed
him
to
whisper
the
forewoman
was
always
cross
but
always
as
if
she
would
rather
not
be
so
as
if
she
were
being
cross
for
a
bet
and
as
if
some
one
were
watching
her
to
see
she
was
not
kind
by
mistake
she
looked
terribly
ill
because
she
had
worked
there
for
three
months
which
was
a
record
i
stood
it
five
weeks
and
then
i
had
a
hemorrhage
only
from
the
throat
the
doctor
said
i
wanted
to
go
to
bed
but
you
ca
because
the
panel
doctors
in
these
parts
will
not
come
to
you
my
doctor
was
half
an
enormous
mile
away
and
it
seemed
he
only
existed
between
seven
and
nine
in
the
evenings
so
i
stayed
up
so
as
not
to
get
too
weak
to
walk
i
went
and
asked
the
governor
for
my
stamps
i
had
only
five
stamps
due
to
me
only
five
valuable
threepences
had
been
stopped
out
of
my
wages
but
i
had
a
silly
conviction
at
that
time
that
the
insurance
act
was
invented
to
help
working
people
what
an
absurd
idea
of
mine
i
went
to
the
jew
for
my
card
he
said
mine
was
a
hard
case
but
i
was
not
entitled
to
a
card
nobody
under
thirty
he
said
was
allowed
by
law
to
have
a
card
so
i
said
it
was
only
fair
to
tell
him
i
was
going
to
the
factory
and
insurance
inspectors
about
him
i
told
him
lots
of
things
and
i
was
so
angry
that
i
cried
he
was
very
angry
too
and
made
me
feel
sick
by
splashing
his
wet
hair
about
he
said
it
was
unfair
for
ladies
to
interfere
in
things
they
knew
nothing
about
i
said
i
interfered
because
i
knew
nothing
about
it
but
that
now
i
knew
i
said
that
ladies
and
women
had
exactly
the
same
kind
of
inside
and
it
was
a
kind
that
never
thrived
on
fluff
instead
of
food
i
told
him
how
i
spent
my
ten
shillings
he
could
interrupt
really
because
he
had
no
voice
then
i
fainted
and
a
friend
i
have
there
called
love
came
in
she
had
been
listening
at
the
door
she
was
very
good
to
me
then
when
i
was
well
again
i
found
another
job
but
i
sha
tell
you
what
it
is
as
for
the
inspectors
i
complained
but
what
the
use
so
long
as
you
must
put
fluff
of
that
pernicious
kind
into
bolsters
just
so
long
will
you
kill
the
strength
and
the
beauty
of
women
it
looked
so
like
a
deadlock
that
it
frightened
me
and
now
in
this
wonderful
life
i
lead
my
friend
wo
let
me
think
of
it
a
deadlock
is
a
dreadful
accident
is
it
because
in
theory
it
does
exist
i
am
working
for
a
new
end
now
is
it
splendid
that
there
is
really
no
place
called
stop
there
is
always
an
end
beyond
the
end
always
something
to
love
and
look
forward
to
life
is
a
luxury
is
it
there
no
use
in
it
but
how
delightful
you
have
told
me
about
the
sea
yet
said
kew
because
i
do
think
you
believe
me
we
were
always
liars
we
that
because
we
romantic
or
if
it
not
romance
the
symptoms
of
the
disease
are
very
like
why
ca
we
get
rid
of
it
all
as
anonyma
does
she
has
no
gift
except
the
gift
of
being
able
to
get
rid
of
superfluous
romance
she
takes
that
great
ease
impersonally
her
pose
is
a
gift
from
heaven
and
an
infernal
bore
but
i
never
get
nearer
to
joy
than
i
do
in
this
secret
world
of
mine
and
with
my
secret
friend
but
what
is
it
what
is
he
like
i
should
be
guilty
of
the
murder
of
a
secret
if
i
told
you
he
particularly
romantic
i
have
seen
him
in
a
poor
light
i
have
watched
him
in
a
most
undignified
temper
i
have
known
him
when
he
wanted
a
shave
i
do
exist
in
this
world
of
mine
i
am
just
a
column
of
thin
air
watching
with
my
soul
then
you
really
telling
lies
to
anonyma
when
you
write
about
it
all
i
not
reproaching
you
of
course
i
only
want
to
get
my
mind
clear
i
suppose
they
lies
assented
jay
ruefully
though
it
seems
sacrilege
to
say
so
for
i
know
these
things
better
than
i
know
myself
but
truth
or
untruth
what
the
use
of
words
like
that
when
miracles
are
in
question
oh
damn
this
what
the
use
trick
said
kew
i
suppose
you
picked
that
up
in
this
private
heaven
of
yours
the
whole
absolutely
my
dear
little
jay
am
i
offending
you
yes
said
jay
kew
sighed
chloris
sighed
too
chloris
had
played
the
thankless
part
of
third
in
this
interview
she
was
jay
friend
a
terrier
with
a
black
eye
she
shared
jay
burning
desire
to
be
of
use
and
like
most
embryo
reformers
she
had
a
poor
taste
in
dress
she
wore
her
tail
at
an
aimless
angle
without
chic
her
markings
were
all
lopsided
but
her
soul
was
ardent
and
her
life
was
always
directed
by
some
rather
inscrutable
theory
or
other
as
a
puppy
she
had
been
an
inspired
optimist
with
legs
like
strips
of
elastic
clumsily
attached
to
a
winged
spirit
later
she
had
adopted
a
vigorous
anarchist
policy
and
had
inaugurated
what
was
probably
known
in
her
set
as
the
bite
at
sight
campaign
cured
of
this
she
had
become
a
gentle
socialist
and
embraced
the
belief
that
all
property
especially
edible
property
should
be
shared
appetites
she
argued
were
meant
to
be
appeased
and
the
preservation
of
game
or
anything
else
in
the
larder
was
an
offence
against
the
community
now
at
the
age
of
five
or
so
she
affected
cynicism
pretended
temporarily
that
life
had
left
a
bitter
taste
in
her
mouth
and
sighed
frequently
kew
said
jay
presently
will
you
promise
not
to
tell
the
family
you
saw
me
i
do
want
it
to
know
about
me
after
all
theories
are
driving
me
and
theories
do
concern
that
family
of
ours
what
the
use
of
a
family
i
saying
this
just
to
exasperate
you
a
family
just
a
little
knot
of
not
necessarily
congenial
people
with
fate
rubbing
their
heads
together
so
as
to
strike
sparks
of
love
love
what
the
use
of
love
i
like
to
catch
that
love
and
box
his
ears
making
such
a
fool
of
the
world
what
the
use
god
knows
said
kew
cheer
up
my
friend
i
promise
i
wo
tell
the
family
i
seen
you
or
anything
about
you
at
the
same
moment
he
remembered
the
motor
tour
promise
faithfully
faithfully
it
a
lovely
word
faithful
is
it
she
said
wriggling
in
her
chair
yours
faithfully
is
a
most
beautiful
ending
to
a
letter
why
is
it
that
faith
with
a
little
f
is
such
a
perfect
thing
and
yet
faith
faith
in
church
is
so
tiring
perhaps
one
is
overworked
and
the
other
is
suggested
kew
as
he
went
out
into
the
darkness
the
noise
of
london
sprang
into
his
ears
and
the
remote
brown
room
where
he
had
left
jay
seemed
to
become
divided
from
him
by
great
distances
the
town
was
like
a
garden
and
he
an
insect
pressed
through
its
undergrowth
the
rare
lamps
and
the
stars
flowered
above
him
my
yesterday
has
gone
has
gone
and
left
me
tired
and
now
comes
and
beats
upon
the
door
so
i
have
built
the
day
that
i
desired
lest
joy
come
not
again
lest
peace
return
no
more
lest
comfort
come
no
more
so
i
have
built
a
proud
and
perfect
day
and
i
have
built
the
towers
of
cliffs
upon
the
sands
the
foxgloves
and
the
gorse
i
planted
on
my
way
the
thyme
the
velvet
thyme
grew
up
beneath
my
hands
grew
pink
beneath
my
hands
so
i
have
built
more
precious
than
a
dream
and
i
have
painted
peace
upon
the
sky
above
and
i
have
made
immense
and
misty
seas
that
seem
more
kind
to
me
than
life
more
fair
to
me
than
love
more
beautiful
than
love
and
i
have
built
a
house
a
house
upon
the
brink
of
high
and
twisted
cliffs
the
sea
low
singing
fills
it
and
there
my
secret
friend
abides
and
there
i
think
i
hide
my
heart
away
before
kills
it
a
cold
kills
it
yes
i
have
built
a
wall
against
so
let
knock
i
shall
not
be
afraid
for
none
shall
give
me
death
and
none
shall
give
me
sorrow
and
none
shall
spoil
this
darling
day
that
i
have
made
no
storm
shall
stir
my
sea
no
night
but
mine
shall
shade
this
day
that
i
have
made
we
will
start
on
our
quest
said
anonyma
i
must
work
nobody
in
anonyma
circle
was
ever
allowed
to
forget
that
she
spent
four
hours
a
week
in
the
service
of
her
country
you
would
never
guess
how
much
insight
into
the
souls
of
the
poor
four
hours
a
week
can
give
to
a
person
like
anonyma
she
had
written
two
books
about
the
brown
borough
since
the
outbreak
of
war
the
provincial
press
had
been
much
impressed
by
their
vivid
picture
of
slum
realities
anonyma
poor
were
always
yearning
yearning
to
be
understood
and
loved
by
a
ministering
upper
class
yearning
for
light
for
art
for
for
novels
by
ladies
the
atmosphere
of
anonyma
fiction
was
thick
with
yearning
anonyma
always
came
home
from
her
work
with
what
she
called
in
her
notebook
she
gave
her
family
the
benefit
of
these
during
the
rest
of
the
week
besides
fitting
them
into
her
books
so
that
although
cousin
gustus
always
conscientiously
bought
a
dozen
copies
of
each
novel
as
it
came
out
he
really
wasted
his
money
for
he
was
obliged
to
know
all
his
wife
copy
by
heart
before
it
got
into
print
by
speaking
each
thought
as
well
as
writing
it
anonyma
rather
unfairly
won
a
reputation
twice
over
with
the
same
material
anonyma
produced
a
vignette
now
in
order
to
show
how
necessary
it
was
that
she
should
hurry
to
her
yearning
flock
i
came
into
the
room
of
one
of
my
sailors
wives
last
week
and
i
found
her
with
a
baby
sobbing
on
her
breast
and
an
empty
hearth
at
her
feet
i
thought
of
the
eternal
tragedy
of
womanhood
i
said
my
love
help
my
dear
there
was
a
pause
and
cousin
gustus
sighed
what
did
she
say
asked
kew
without
expecting
an
answer
from
the
artist
after
all
a
is
not
intended
to
have
a
sequel
it
is
supposed
to
fall
complete
with
a
little
splash
into
your
silent
understanding
i
must
say
kew
was
rather
tiresome
in
refusing
to
be
content
with
the
splash
so
few
women
really
understand
how
to
stop
a
child
crying
said
cousin
gustus
speaking
from
bitter
and
universal
experience
that
the
point
said
kew
the
child
had
probably
swallowed
a
pin
it
generally
breaks
my
heart
to
hear
a
story
spoilt
but
with
i
did
not
mind
because
they
were
told
as
true
and
yet
they
did
not
ring
true
i
must
tell
you
that
anonyma
had
married
into
a
family
of
accomplished
white
liars
and
to
them
the
ring
of
truth
was
as
unmistakable
as
the
few
people
could
lie
successfully
to
kew
or
jay
they
knew
that
art
from
the
inside
white
lies
are
easily
justified
but
almost
any
lie
can
be
whitewashed
apart
from
the
mutual
attitude
of
kew
and
jay
who
possessed
something
between
them
that
might
be
called
good
faith
there
was
hardly
any
trust
included
in
that
family
relationship
cousin
gustus
distrusted
youth
he
thought
young
people
were
always
either
lying
to
him
or
laughing
at
him
and
indeed
they
often
were
only
not
so
often
as
he
thought
he
was
no
prop
on
which
to
repose
confidence
and
it
was
very
easy
both
to
tell
him
lies
and
not
to
tell
him
facts
gustus
had
no
gift
of
intimacy
she
was
reserved
about
everything
except
herself
or
what
she
believed
to
be
herself
the
self
that
she
shared
so
generously
with
others
was
however
not
founded
on
fact
but
modelled
on
the
heroine
of
all
her
books
she
killed
her
heroine
whenever
possible
i
think
she
only
once
married
her
yet
still
the
creature
remained
immortal
in
gustus
public
personality
she
concealed
or
transformed
everything
that
did
not
seem
artistic
her
notebook
was
a
tangle
of
the
rest
of
the
family
knew
this
they
never
pretended
to
believe
her
kew
and
jay
were
skilled
romancers
fact
was
clay
in
their
hands
nobody
had
ever
taught
them
such
a
dull
lesson
as
exact
truthfulness
if
they
built
the
bare
bones
of
their
structures
fairly
accurately
they
placed
the
whole
in
an
artificial
light
altering
in
some
effective
way
the
spirit
of
the
facts
education
had
impressed
the
importance
of
technical
truthfulness
on
kew
but
he
was
a
quick
talker
and
in
order
to
keep
him
in
line
with
his
tongue
nature
had
made
him
quick
of
wit
quick
in
argument
and
unconsciously
quick
in
making
and
seeing
loopholes
for
escape
he
was
at
present
perfectly
comfortable
in
his
anomalous
position
regarding
a
search
round
the
for
a
jay
he
knew
to
be
in
the
brown
borough
if
i
am
going
to
work
i
must
go
said
anonyma
russ
and
i
will
go
together
as
far
as
the
underground
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
the
scarlet
bird
in
her
hat
had
an
arresting
expression
as
she
was
putting
on
her
gloves
she
said
sorry
kew
about
your
disappointment
not
finding
nana
at
home
last
night
but
i
told
you
so
she
had
no
fear
of
this
phrase
never
mind
said
kew
mildly
we
put
christina
on
the
track
russell
said
a
polite
to
his
hound
and
accompanied
his
friend
anonyma
to
the
underground
that
was
a
fateful
little
journey
for
him
as
he
turned
from
anonyma
side
at
the
bookstall
he
noticed
a
positively
beckoning
to
him
it
had
a
lady
conductor
and
she
was
poised
expectantly
one
hand
on
the
bell
and
the
other
beckoning
to
russell
his
nature
was
docile
and
the
was
bound
for
chancery
lane
his
destination
he
mounted
the
i
need
hardly
tell
you
that
a
that
makes
deliberate
advances
to
the
public
is
the
rarest
sight
in
london
the
looks
upon
the
public
as
dust
beneath
its
tyres
even
a
with
red
tabs
on
his
way
to
whitehall
looks
pathetically
humble
waggling
his
cane
at
a
all
have
a
kingly
look
it
comes
from
their
proud
position
the
rest
of
the
world
is
only
worthy
to
communicate
with
that
noble
race
by
means
of
nods
and
becks
and
wreathed
smiles
chancery
lane
please
said
russell
but
why
did
you
stop
specially
for
me
i
thought
your
wife
hailed
me
sir
lied
the
any
allusion
to
his
wife
mildly
annoyed
russell
not
my
wife
he
said
merely
a
friend
oh
i
your
pardon
sir
said
the
and
underlined
the
beg
with
the
ting
of
her
she
was
rather
a
darling
because
she
was
also
jay
she
had
a
short
though
not
a
fat
face
soft
eyes
and
very
soft
hair
cut
short
to
just
below
the
lobes
of
her
ears
a
gentleman
with
dingy
but
elaborate
hailed
and
mounted
the
shufftesbury
uvvenue
he
asked
he
said
it
that
way
of
course
because
he
was
a
shakespearian
actor
the
gave
him
his
ticket
and
then
took
her
stand
upon
her
platform
more
or
less
unaware
that
russell
and
the
actor
both
next
to
the
door
and
opposite
to
each
other
were
looking
at
her
with
a
pleased
look
russell
thought
for
some
time
and
then
he
said
a
day
that
what
it
is
replied
the
i
wonder
if
it
wrong
to
enjoy
being
a
i
should
think
so
said
russell
cautiously
why
the
waved
her
hand
towards
a
state
hint
that
shouted
in
letters
six
foot
high
from
an
opposite
wall
do
use
a
motor
car
for
pleasure
russell
read
it
very
carefully
and
said
nothing
this
is
a
motor
car
observed
the
glancing
at
her
inaccessible
chauffeur
and
as
for
pleasure
the
high
houses
rose
out
of
the
earth
like
alps
and
the
roar
in
the
morning
was
like
large
music
she
knew
she
had
been
an
olympian
in
a
recent
life
because
she
found
herself
familiar
with
greater
and
more
gorgeous
speed
than
any
attains
and
with
the
divine
discords
that
high
mountains
and
high
cities
sing
i
hope
it
not
wrong
because
i
going
on
a
motor
tour
said
russell
on
business
of
a
sort
and
yet
also
on
pleasure
on
a
search
as
a
matter
of
fact
oh
any
search
is
pleasure
said
the
especially
if
an
abstract
search
is
said
russell
a
search
for
a
person
the
looked
at
the
sky
and
are
anonyma
and
kew
going
too
she
thought
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
she
had
deliberately
plucked
him
from
the
side
of
anonyma
perhaps
any
pleasure
is
wrong
in
these
days
she
said
come
come
said
the
actor
whut
wrung
with
these
days
a
german
ship
sunk
yesterday
thut
pleasurable
enough
the
turned
a
cold
eye
upon
him
i
can
cheer
but
not
laugh
over
such
news
as
that
she
said
pompously
does
even
a
german
find
the
sea
bitter
to
drown
in
an
english
woman
or
a
german
butcher
is
it
all
the
same
when
it
comes
to
a
me
with
a
throat
full
of
water
has
a
german
got
a
me
the
actor
looked
at
his
russell
thought
shufftesbury
uvvenue
arrived
soon
and
the
actor
alighted
with
some
relief
when
the
started
again
the
said
do
you
think
the
only
way
you
can
get
pleasure
out
of
it
all
is
by
treating
life
as
a
bead
upon
a
string
that
a
sufficient
way
surely
said
russell
if
you
can
truly
reach
it
in
the
strand
he
asked
may
i
come
in
this
again
this
is
a
public
observed
the
this
is
monday
said
russell
may
i
gather
that
during
this
week
your
will
be
passing
kensington
church
at
eleven
every
morning
the
did
not
answer
she
went
to
the
top
of
the
to
say
fezz
plizz
russell
thought
so
furiously
that
he
was
only
roused
by
the
sound
of
paul
striking
apparently
several
dozen
in
his
immediate
vicinity
this
is
ludgate
hill
i
only
paid
you
as
far
as
chancery
lane
i
owe
you
another
halfpenny
said
russell
a
penny
said
the
as
he
disappeared
she
thought
there
is
something
remarkable
about
that
man
i
wish
i
had
been
so
prosy
i
wonder
where
and
why
anonyma
picked
him
up
when
russell
came
home
that
evening
he
said
i
met
is
it
wonderful
the
people
and
the
things
one
meets
said
gustus
i
met
a
child
with
nothing
but
one
garment
on
rolling
like
a
sparrow
in
the
dust
the
one
garment
i
thought
was
the
only
drawback
in
the
scene
why
ca
we
get
back
to
simplicity
russell
on
second
thoughts
was
glad
he
had
been
interrupted
he
did
not
feel
discouraged
only
he
decided
not
to
try
again
his
hound
jumped
on
to
his
knee
and
put
a
paw
into
his
hand
i
also
persuaded
a
woman
to
give
up
drink
continued
gustus
i
put
it
to
her
on
the
ground
of
simplicity
she
was
in
bed
having
been
drunk
the
night
before
and
i
sat
on
her
bed
with
my
hand
on
hers
i
said
there
are
no
essentials
in
life
but
bread
and
water
and
love
everything
else
is
a
sort
of
which
has
appeared
on
the
surface
of
nature
a
disease
which
we
call
civilization
she
cried
bitterly
and
i
gathered
that
she
was
lacking
in
all
three
essentials
i
went
and
bought
her
four
loaves
of
bread
on
condition
she
would
promise
never
to
touch
intoxicants
again
i
said
i
would
not
go
away
until
she
promised
she
promised
i
left
her
still
crying
cousin
gustus
sighed
he
never
went
about
himself
and
only
saw
the
world
through
his
wife
eyes
this
did
not
tend
to
cure
his
pessimism
it
is
wonderful
how
one
can
reach
the
of
life
in
two
hours
among
the
poor
and
simple
said
gustus
by
the
way
i
only
put
in
two
hours
because
i
think
i
can
do
better
work
in
two
hours
twice
a
week
than
in
four
hours
once
so
i
shall
come
up
for
the
afternoon
one
day
this
week
from
wherever
we
are
by
then
and
leave
you
three
men
prostrate
on
some
shore
with
your
ears
to
nature
like
a
child
ear
to
a
shell
she
groped
for
her
notebook
i
must
come
up
now
and
then
too
said
russell
and
poked
his
hound
secretly
in
the
ribs
i
ca
tell
you
what
countless
miles
away
his
was
by
now
a
certain
fraction
of
her
to
be
sure
was
sitting
in
the
dark
room
at
number
eighteen
mabel
place
brown
borough
with
fierce
hands
pinching
the
and
a
hot
forehead
on
the
table
all
day
long
the
thirst
for
a
secret
journey
had
been
in
her
throat
all
day
long
the
elaborate
tangle
of
london
had
made
difficult
her
way
but
she
had
kicked
aside
the
snare
now
and
her
free
feet
were
on
the
step
of
the
house
by
the
sea
no
voices
met
her
at
the
door
the
hall
was
empty
the
firelight
pencilled
in
gold
the
edges
of
the
wooden
figure
that
presided
over
the
stairs
i
think
i
told
you
about
that
figure
i
never
knew
whose
it
was
a
saint
i
think
but
her
virtuous
expression
was
marred
by
her
broken
nose
and
the
finger
with
which
she
had
once
pointed
to
heaven
was
also
broken
her
figure
was
rather
stiff
and
so
were
her
draperies
which
fell
in
straight
folds
to
her
blocklike
feet
her
right
hand
was
raised
high
and
her
left
was
held
alertly
away
from
her
side
and
had
unseparated
fingers
she
had
seen
a
great
procession
of
generations
pass
her
pedestal
but
she
never
saw
jay
of
course
not
for
jay
was
not
there
only
a
column
of
thin
watching
air
haunted
the
house
there
are
many
ghosts
that
haunt
the
house
by
the
sea
jay
is
of
course
one
of
them
and
for
this
reason
she
knows
more
about
ghosts
than
any
one
i
know
fragments
of
untold
stories
are
familiar
to
her
she
knows
how
you
may
hear
in
the
dark
a
movement
by
your
bed
and
fling
out
your
hand
and
feel
it
grasped
and
then
feel
the
grasp
slide
up
from
your
hand
to
your
shoulder
from
your
shoulder
to
your
throat
from
your
throat
to
your
heart
she
knows
how
you
may
go
between
trees
in
the
moonlight
to
meet
your
friend
and
find
suddenly
that
some
one
is
keeping
pace
with
you
and
how
you
mistaking
this
companion
for
your
friend
may
say
some
silly
greeting
that
only
your
friend
understands
and
how
your
heart
drops
as
you
hear
the
first
breath
of
the
reply
she
knows
how
walking
in
the
streets
of
london
you
may
cross
the
path
of
some
great
one
who
had
a
prior
right
by
many
thousand
years
to
walk
beside
the
thames
these
are
the
ghost
stories
that
never
get
told
few
people
can
read
them
between
the
lines
of
press
accounts
of
inquests
or
in
the
dignified
announcements
of
the
failure
of
hearts
on
the
front
page
of
the
but
jay
knows
because
of
her
intimacy
with
the
house
by
the
sea
there
she
meets
her
the
house
as
i
told
you
has
hardly
any
garden
having
the
sea
it
does
need
one
but
there
is
a
little
formal
place
about
twenty
paces
across
set
as
it
were
in
the
heart
of
the
house
a
small
prim
square
bounded
on
the
north
south
and
east
by
the
house
itself
and
on
the
west
by
the
cliff
and
the
sea
there
is
a
stone
balustrade
to
divide
the
garden
from
space
in
the
middle
of
the
square
is
a
stone
basin
with
becalmed
and
of
course
goldfish
round
the
basin
the
orderly
ranks
of
little
clipped
box
hedges
manoeuvre
the
untamed
elements
in
the
garden
are
the
climbing
things
they
sing
in
gold
and
yellow
and
orange
and
red
from
the
walls
the
only
official
way
into
the
garden
is
a
door
from
the
house
a
bald
door
without
eyebrows
so
to
speak
like
all
the
doors
and
windows
in
the
house
but
there
is
an
unofficial
way
into
the
garden
and
jay
found
her
secret
friend
there
this
is
the
short
cut
to
the
sea
in
other
words
it
is
a
wriggly
ladder
one
end
of
which
you
attach
to
a
hook
in
the
wall
and
the
other
you
throw
over
the
balustrade
down
the
cliff
to
the
sea
it
is
a
long
way
to
walk
round
the
house
and
along
the
cliff
and
down
to
the
sea
by
the
path
and
just
as
the
always
want
to
be
one
minute
and
a
half
from
the
church
and
the
so
we
in
the
secret
house
can
not
afford
to
be
more
than
a
minute
and
a
half
from
the
sea
the
secret
friend
was
there
and
he
was
gazing
so
earnestly
down
the
cliff
that
his
hair
was
hanging
forward
most
unbeautifully
and
he
was
rather
red
in
the
face
he
was
looking
at
a
little
boat
which
was
on
its
way
towards
the
foot
of
the
wriggly
ladder
a
schooner
with
the
low
sun
climbing
down
her
rigging
breathed
on
the
breathing
sea
not
far
away
the
tide
was
high
the
oars
of
the
little
boat
suddenly
wavered
and
were
paralysed
one
of
the
rowers
made
a
quick
movement
with
his
hand
it
the
law
said
the
secret
friend
and
he
tried
spasmodically
to
extinguish
the
sun
with
his
hand
it
the
law
the
man
with
the
tall
and
dewy
brow
the
law
in
a
fat
boat
came
sneaking
round
the
near
point
of
the
cliff
the
air
was
so
still
and
the
sea
so
calm
that
you
could
hear
the
sides
of
the
boat
grate
against
the
cliff
and
the
air
was
so
clear
that
you
could
see
the
tall
and
dewy
brow
of
the
law
as
he
stood
up
and
discovered
the
wriggly
ladder
to
have
a
face
like
that
said
the
secret
friend
is
to
challenge
fate
it
makes
me
sick
what
is
this
asked
the
law
although
there
seemed
little
doubt
that
the
thing
was
a
wriggly
ladder
no
one
answered
so
the
law
rowed
to
the
foot
of
the
thing
in
question
the
secret
friend
jerked
it
up
about
six
feet
and
secured
it
so
the
law
cleared
its
throat
and
looked
nervously
at
the
schooner
and
at
the
sun
and
at
the
other
boat
and
at
the
secret
friend
the
law
likes
to
be
argued
with
take
away
words
and
where
is
the
law
silence
always
annoys
it
yet
there
was
no
silence
in
the
secret
world
i
remember
how
the
roses
sang
and
how
the
sea
mourned
over
the
confusion
of
its
gentle
dreams
the
knocking
of
the
slow
sea
upon
the
cliff
seemed
like
the
ticking
of
the
great
clock
that
is
our
world
it
was
a
night
when
every
horizon
had
heaven
calling
from
the
other
side
the
story
went
on
it
was
chloris
who
brought
jay
back
to
number
eighteen
mabel
place
brown
borough
chloris
gave
an
unromantic
snort
and
sat
with
unnecessary
clumsiness
upon
jay
toe
so
jay
returned
falling
suddenly
out
of
the
music
of
the
sea
into
the
music
of
distant
boy
scouts
on
the
march
number
eighteen
mabel
place
is
not
as
a
rule
a
hopeful
place
to
return
to
jay
and
i
know
quite
well
what
satan
felt
like
when
he
was
expelled
from
heaven
so
jay
whose
refuge
from
most
ills
was
talk
went
to
see
a
friend
she
had
many
friends
in
the
brown
borough
and
most
of
them
were
what
gustus
would
call
undeserving
gustus
has
a
very
high
mind
she
and
the
are
dreadfully
institutions
i
think
they
forget
what
it
feels
like
to
have
a
good
rampageous
kick
against
the
pricks
nearly
everybody
in
the
brown
borough
enjoys
a
kick
once
a
week
on
and
some
of
us
go
on
kicking
all
our
lives
at
any
rate
the
brown
borough
is
peopled
with
babies
young
and
old
and
high
minds
and
institutions
are
apt
to
look
over
heads
jay
had
a
low
mind
and
walked
about
on
the
brown
borough
level
i
have
got
neuralgia
said
jay
to
chloris
my
hat
feels
too
tight
my
head
feels
like
de
veau
i
shall
go
and
talk
to
edwards
and
so
she
did
and
found
that
edwards
had
been
wanting
to
see
her
to
tell
her
that
the
war
would
be
over
in
june
and
that
the
edwards
nephew
knew
on
the
best
authority
that
the
kaser
could
get
no
kipper
to
his
breakfast
any
more
because
preserdink
wilson
was
of
them
up
upon
the
high
seas
and
that
jimmy
wragge
was
wanted
for
helping
himself
and
that
young
dusty
morgan
the
lodger
had
gone
for
a
soldier
and
his
wife
had
taken
his
job
as
driver
of
a
van
there
only
two
jobs
now
said
edwards
wot
you
never
see
a
woman
doin
and
one
a
burglar
an
the
other
a
scarecrow
jay
said
the
lady
burglars
would
be
so
clever
they
never
get
into
the
papers
and
the
lady
scarecrows
would
be
so
attractive
that
fascinate
the
birds
and
then
edwards
considered
what
she
would
say
to
an
if
she
had
him
here
and
jay
was
called
upon
to
provide
replies
in
the
lingo
her
german
was
so
patriotically
rusty
that
she
could
think
of
no
better
retorts
than
nicht
hinauslehnen
or
bitte
nicht
zu
rauchen
or
heisses
wasser
bitte
or
wacht
am
rhein
or
streng
verboten
yet
the
dramatic
effect
of
the
interview
was
very
good
indeed
and
edwards
arguments
were
unanswerable
in
any
tongue
and
then
they
thought
they
would
make
a
surprise
for
young
mrs
dusty
morgan
the
lodger
against
she
come
back
from
work
because
she
was
that
so
they
went
and
bought
some
ribbon
to
tie
up
the
curtains
and
some
flowers
for
the
table
and
put
the
chairs
in
happy
and
new
attitudes
of
expectancy
and
cleaned
the
windows
putting
a
piece
of
white
paper
on
the
broken
pane
instead
of
the
rag
which
was
rather
weary
of
its
job
and
then
edwards
confided
to
jay
that
young
mrs
dusty
wanted
very
much
to
find
the
picture
of
a
real
soldier
so
that
she
might
look
at
it
and
remember
how
this
business
was
going
to
make
a
man
of
young
dusty
and
jay
went
all
the
way
to
the
city
and
could
find
no
picture
of
a
soldier
and
then
she
came
back
to
the
brown
borough
and
because
of
the
intervention
of
providence
found
albrecht
dürer
george
in
a
and
they
hung
it
up
over
the
mantelpiece
and
decided
that
it
was
rather
like
dusty
if
it
for
the
uniform
and
the
general
effect
was
so
superb
that
jay
nearly
spoilt
it
all
by
jumping
a
hole
in
the
floor
so
as
to
jog
time
elbow
and
bring
mrs
dusty
home
quickly
to
see
it
all
it
was
a
very
delicate
floor
jay
always
jumped
when
she
was
impatient
she
did
everything
with
double
fervour
and
where
you
or
i
would
have
stamped
one
foot
she
stamped
two
at
once
mrs
dusty
morgan
came
back
a
little
bit
drunk
when
she
saw
the
saint
over
the
mantelpiece
she
cried
and
blasted
the
war
that
made
it
necessary
to
wear
them
respirators
all
over
the
saint
is
in
armour
and
when
she
saw
the
flowers
she
laughed
and
said
it
seemed
like
to
have
dusty
away
oh
bend
your
eyes
nor
send
your
glance
about
oh
watch
your
feet
nor
stray
beyond
the
kerb
oh
bind
your
heart
lest
it
find
secrets
out
for
thus
no
punishment
of
magic
shall
disturb
your
very
great
content
oh
shut
your
lips
to
words
that
are
forbidden
oh
throw
away
your
sword
nor
think
to
fight
seek
not
the
best
the
best
is
better
hidden
thus
need
you
have
no
fear
no
terrible
delight
shall
cross
your
path
my
dear
call
no
man
foe
but
never
love
a
stranger
build
up
no
plan
nor
any
star
pursue
go
forth
with
crowds
in
loneliness
is
danger
thus
nothing
fate
can
send
and
nothing
fate
can
do
shall
pierce
your
peace
my
friend
christina
the
motor
car
started
next
morning
she
set
her
tyres
on
the
road
to
the
secret
world
for
all
the
clues
that
jay
provided
pointed
to
that
region
here
is
another
letter
from
jay
said
gustus
as
they
started
bristling
with
clues
odd
under
the
circumstances
that
she
writes
to
me
so
often
and
so
freely
i
will
read
you
some
of
it
but
not
all
until
i
have
thought
my
suspicions
over
she
writes
a
collision
with
the
law
under
a
great
sunset
it
would
have
been
rather
silly
by
common
daylight
but
under
a
yellow
sky
with
stars
in
it
i
think
nothing
can
live
but
romance
the
tide
was
coming
up
and
the
law
a
man
with
a
tall
and
dewy
brow
rowed
up
to
the
foot
of
our
little
ladder
that
leads
to
the
sea
you
know
those
round
stone
balls
that
sit
on
the
balustrades
of
formal
gardens
such
as
this
we
only
meant
to
frighten
the
law
a
splash
was
all
that
we
intended
but
the
sun
was
in
my
friend
eyes
as
he
dropped
the
ball
it
struck
the
bow
of
the
boat
which
went
under
like
a
frightened
porpoise
there
were
two
men
in
it
besides
the
law
itself
and
they
all
came
up
spitting
and
spouting
and
stood
up
to
their
necks
in
water
oaths
bubbled
up
to
us
the
boat
came
up
badly
perforated
and
i
expect
we
shall
get
into
trouble
it
was
funny
but
the
war
has
rather
pacified
us
belligerents
and
made
people
like
me
unused
to
collisions
with
authority
i
felt
very
nervous
but
it
was
all
right
because
i
will
read
you
no
more
but
in
that
much
there
should
be
several
clues
we
must
keep
the
western
sun
in
our
eyes
to
begin
with
we
must
look
out
for
a
householder
of
irregular
not
to
say
murderous
habits
said
cousin
gustus
juggling
with
stone
balls
is
a
trick
that
is
frequently
fatal
nobody
but
jay
would
encourage
it
we
must
comb
out
all
western
seaside
resorts
for
local
police
with
tall
and
dewy
brows
said
kew
but
russell
who
preferred
not
to
speak
and
drive
christina
at
the
same
time
drew
up
to
the
kerb
and
removed
his
gloves
preparatory
to
saying
something
of
importance
russell
was
at
his
best
in
a
car
or
to
put
it
another
way
he
was
at
his
worst
everywhere
else
when
he
and
christina
went
out
together
they
were
only
one
entity
they
were
a
centaur
on
wheels
russell
could
feel
the
rushing
of
the
road
beneath
his
tyres
and
i
think
if
you
had
stuck
a
pin
into
the
back
seat
russell
would
have
known
it
you
could
feel
now
the
puzzled
growl
of
christina
engines
as
russell
pondered
but
i
remember
said
russell
now
did
i
see
it
in
the
paper
i
remember
half
a
minute
it
is
coming
back
here
paper
said
kew
who
was
getting
a
little
confused
you
will
feel
the
same
when
you
set
out
to
follow
the
western
sun
in
search
of
something
you
know
you
have
left
behind
you
russell
and
christina
lingered
beside
the
kerb
for
quite
a
minute
and
then
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
started
again
so
the
family
set
their
faces
towards
the
secret
world
with
russell
as
their
guide
and
the
morning
sun
behind
them
london
is
a
friend
whom
i
can
leave
knowing
without
doubt
that
she
will
be
the
same
to
me
when
i
return
or
forty
years
hence
and
that
if
i
do
not
return
she
will
sing
the
same
song
to
inheritors
of
my
happy
lot
in
future
generations
always
whether
sleeping
or
waking
i
shall
know
that
in
spring
the
sun
rides
over
the
silver
streets
of
kensington
and
that
in
the
gardens
the
shorn
sheep
find
very
green
pasture
always
the
plaited
threads
of
traffic
will
wind
about
the
reel
of
london
always
as
you
go
up
regent
street
from
pall
mall
and
look
back
westminster
will
rise
with
you
like
a
dim
sun
over
the
horizon
of
whitehall
that
dive
down
fleet
street
and
up
to
the
black
and
white
cliffs
of
paul
will
for
ever
bring
to
mind
some
rumour
of
romance
there
is
always
a
romance
that
we
leave
behind
in
london
and
always
london
enlocks
that
flower
for
us
and
keeps
it
fresh
so
that
when
we
come
back
we
have
our
romance
again
russell
was
a
lover
of
london
and
that
is
why
he
liked
his
he
was
an
uncalculating
sort
of
man
and
he
only
thought
that
he
had
found
a
flower
in
london
a
very
london
flower
and
he
hoped
that
london
would
show
it
to
him
again
he
had
no
instinct
either
for
the
past
or
the
future
he
never
looked
back
over
the
road
he
had
trod
unless
he
was
obliged
to
and
he
never
tried
to
look
forward
to
the
end
of
the
road
he
was
treading
gustus
with
an
iron
expression
about
her
chin
kept
time
to
the
beat
of
christina
engine
with
the
throbbing
of
disagreeable
thoughts
there
was
one
thing
very
plain
to
her
in
the
matter
of
jay
that
jay
was
living
a
life
that
in
a
novel
is
called
free
but
in
a
family
well
you
know
what
gustus
knew
all
about
these
friends
with
capital
f
friends
with
hair
flopping
over
their
foreheads
friends
who
might
drop
stone
balls
on
the
law
and
still
retain
their
capital
f
she
had
in
fact
written
about
them
with
much
daring
and
freedom
but
one
young
relations
may
never
share
the
privileges
of
one
heroines
sympathy
with
such
goings
on
must
be
confined
to
the
printed
page
i
will
keep
these
things
from
the
others
thought
gustus
they
have
no
suspicions
and
if
we
can
find
jay
i
may
be
able
to
save
her
reputation
yet
really
she
was
thinking
as
much
of
her
own
good
name
as
of
jay
for
there
was
a
most
irritating
similarity
between
jay
present
apparent
practices
and
gustus
own
theories
the
beauty
of
a
free
life
of
simplicity
had
filled
pages
of
anonyma
notebooks
and
also
to
the
annoyance
of
cousin
gustus
had
overflowed
into
her
conversation
cousin
gustus
memory
had
been
constantly
busy
extracting
from
the
past
moral
tales
concerning
the
disasters
attendant
on
excessive
simplicity
in
human
relationships
for
a
time
it
had
seemed
as
if
cousin
gustus
lot
had
been
cast
entirely
with
the
matrimonially
unorthodox
and
now
gustus
for
one
impatient
minute
wished
that
the
children
would
pay
more
attention
to
their
elderly
and
experienced
guardian
it
was
too
much
to
ask
her
a
professional
to
adapt
her
theories
to
the
young
and
literal
that
was
the
worst
of
jay
she
was
so
literal
so
unimaginative
so
lacking
in
the
simple
unpractical
quality
of
poetry
however
not
a
word
to
the
others
jay
reputation
and
anonyma
dignity
might
yet
be
saved
i
do
know
where
we
are
going
said
anonyma
presently
i
have
no
bump
of
locality
she
always
spoke
proudly
of
her
failings
as
though
there
were
a
rapt
press
interviewer
at
her
elbow
anxious
to
make
a
about
her
russell
was
thinking
and
kew
was
singing
so
between
them
they
forgot
to
shape
the
course
of
christina
due
west
when
they
got
outside
london
they
found
themselves
going
south
to
go
out
of
london
was
like
going
out
of
doors
the
beauty
of
london
is
a
dim
beauty
and
while
you
are
in
the
middle
of
it
you
forget
what
it
is
like
to
see
things
clearly
in
london
every
hour
is
a
hill
of
adventure
and
in
the
country
every
hour
is
a
dimple
in
a
quiet
expanse
of
time
the
family
went
out
over
the
hills
of
surrey
and
between
roadside
trees
they
saw
the
crowned
heads
of
the
seaward
downs
the
horizon
sank
lower
around
them
the
fields
and
woods
circled
and
squared
the
ribs
of
the
land
before
sunset
they
had
reached
the
little
town
that
guards
the
gate
in
the
wall
of
the
sussex
downs
they
were
welcomed
by
a
thunderstorm
and
by
passionate
rain
that
drove
them
to
the
inn
christina
torn
between
her
pride
of
soul
and
her
pride
of
paint
was
obliged
to
edge
herself
into
a
shed
which
was
already
occupied
by
two
cows
and
a
red
and
blue
waggon
when
the
pursuers
of
jay
set
their
feet
on
the
uneven
floor
of
the
inn
they
recognised
the
place
immediately
as
ideal
its
windows
squinted
its
floor
made
you
feel
as
though
you
were
drunk
its
banisters
reeled
its
flights
of
stairs
looked
frequently
round
in
an
angular
way
at
their
own
beginnings
how
arcadian
said
gustus
as
she
splashed
her
signature
into
the
visitor
book
one
could
be
content
to
vegetate
for
ever
here
is
it
pathetic
how
one
spends
one
life
collecting
heart
desires
until
one
suddenly
discovers
that
in
having
nothing
and
in
desiring
nothing
lies
happiness
but
when
they
had
been
shown
their
and
had
ordered
their
supper
lamb
and
early
peas
and
gooseberry
tart
with
of
cream
gustus
saw
the
ring
that
great
green
breast
of
the
country
against
the
broken
evening
sky
and
said
now
i
see
heights
and
i
shall
never
be
happy
or
hungry
till
i
have
climbed
them
the
lord
made
me
so
that
i
am
never
content
until
i
am
as
near
the
sky
as
possible
silly
no
doubt
but
what
a
sky
and
pale
pink
what
a
unique
chord
of
colour
same
chord
as
the
livery
of
the
bank
or
england
said
kew
who
was
hungry
and
had
an
aching
shoulder
he
hated
beauty
talked
just
as
he
hated
poetry
forced
into
print
apropos
of
nothing
even
to
hear
the
psalms
read
aloud
used
to
make
him
blush
before
his
honest
orthodoxy
hardened
him
gustus
asked
the
lamb
and
gooseberry
tart
to
delay
their
coming
she
placed
cousin
gustus
in
an
first
wrapping
him
up
because
he
felt
cold
and
then
unwrapping
him
again
because
he
felt
hot
she
kissed
him
we
sha
be
more
than
an
hour
she
said
when
gustus
said
an
hour
she
meant
two
if
she
had
meant
an
hour
she
would
have
said
twenty
minutes
you
must
watch
for
us
to
appear
on
the
highest
point
of
the
ring
do
watch
but
pray
murmured
kew
there
that
thunderstorm
just
working
up
to
another
display
and
so
it
was
but
when
they
reached
the
ridge
of
down
that
led
to
the
ring
they
were
glad
they
had
come
they
were
and
and
but
there
is
a
reward
to
every
effort
there
was
an
enormous
sky
and
the
sunlight
spilled
between
the
clouds
to
fall
in
pools
upon
the
world
there
was
a
chord
made
by
many
larks
in
the
sky
the
valleys
held
joy
as
a
cup
holds
water
from
the
down
the
took
great
bites
the
crinolined
trees
curtseyed
down
the
slopes
the
sea
cut
the
world
in
half
the
sight
of
a
distant
town
at
the
corner
of
the
river
and
the
coast
made
one
laugh
for
pleasure
there
was
a
boat
with
sunlit
sails
creeping
across
the
sea
i
never
see
a
boat
on
an
utterly
lonely
sea
without
thinking
of
the
secret
stories
that
it
carries
of
the
sun
moving
round
that
private
world
of
the
shadows
upon
the
deck
that
i
can
not
see
of
the
song
of
passing
seas
that
i
can
not
hear
of
the
night
coming
across
a
great
horizon
to
devour
it
when
i
shall
have
forgotten
it
further
off
and
more
suggestive
than
a
star
it
seems
to
me
a
gust
of
sunlight
struck
the
watchers
and
passed
they
each
ran
a
few
steps
towards
the
sight
that
pleased
them
most
and
then
they
stood
so
long
that
russell
hound
had
time
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
every
smell
within
twenty
yards
he
turned
over
a
snail
that
sat
round
and
striped
like
a
peppermint
on
the
short
grass
he
patted
a
little
beetle
that
pushed
its
way
across
a
world
of
disproportionate
size
and
then
by
peevishly
pulling
the
end
of
his
whip
which
hung
from
russell
pensive
hand
he
suggested
that
the
pursuit
should
continue
so
they
walked
to
the
crest
of
wood
that
stands
at
the
top
of
the
ring
a
compressed
tabloid
forest
fifty
yards
from
side
to
side
as
round
as
a
florin
piece
the
slopes
rushed
away
from
every
side
of
it
there
was
a
dark
secret
beneath
those
trees
there
was
a
hint
of
very
ancient
love
and
still
more
ancient
hatred
you
could
feel
things
beyond
understanding
you
left
fact
outside
under
the
sky
and
went
in
with
a
naked
soul
they
walked
across
it
in
silence
well
apart
from
each
other
when
they
came
out
the
other
side
gustus
said
we
must
stay
for
a
little
while
within
reach
of
this
it
has
something
russell
swallowed
something
that
he
had
thought
of
saying
and
instead
drew
his
hound
attention
to
a
yellow
square
of
which
made
brilliant
the
distance
kew
said
nothing
but
he
felt
choked
with
a
lost
remembrance
of
a
very
old
childhood
he
seemed
to
taste
the
quiet
taste
of
youth
here
there
was
even
a
feeling
of
going
home
through
a
damp
evening
to
a
nursery
tea
it
was
the
nursery
of
all
secret
worlds
gods
had
been
born
there
no
surprise
could
live
there
now
no
wonder
no
protest
the
years
like
minutes
fled
between
those
trees
dynasties
might
fall
during
the
singing
of
a
bird
i
think
the
thing
that
haunted
the
wood
was
a
thing
exactly
as
old
and
as
romantic
as
the
first
child
that
tracked
its
secret
friend
across
the
floor
of
a
forest
oh
friend
of
childlike
mind
what
is
it
that
these
two
years
have
taken
from
us
what
is
it
that
we
have
lost
oh
friend
besides
contentment
all
the
way
home
kew
sang
very
loudly
the
first
tune
he
ever
knew
when
the
family
including
russell
got
back
to
the
inn
the
lamb
and
the
gooseberry
tart
and
cousin
gustus
were
all
waiting
for
them
but
they
were
delayed
in
the
hall
a
stout
young
woman
with
a
pleasant
face
of
small
vocabulary
turned
from
the
visitors
book
and
stopped
gustus
are
you
the
augustus
martin
she
asked
i
am
she
replied
anonyma
her
grammar
in
moments
of
emergency
always
impressed
kew
i
can
not
say
that
gustus
seemed
surprised
she
was
the
sort
of
person
to
hide
even
from
herself
the
fact
that
this
thing
had
never
happened
before
she
remained
perfectly
calm
as
if
repeating
a
hackneyed
experience
kew
was
astonished
russell
shared
this
feeling
having
a
certain
personal
admiration
for
gustus
he
had
tried
on
more
than
one
occasion
to
find
pleasure
in
her
books
but
without
success
the
stout
young
lady
said
nothing
more
than
oh
for
the
moment
but
she
breathed
it
in
such
a
manner
that
gustus
saw
at
once
the
duty
of
asking
her
to
dine
with
the
family
when
the
admirer
was
introduced
to
cousin
gustus
she
said
oh
so
this
is
your
husband
and
gazed
on
that
melancholy
man
with
eagerness
when
she
saw
russell
hound
she
said
and
this
is
your
dog
and
was
about
to
crown
him
with
a
corresponding
halo
when
gustus
disclaimed
the
connection
it
is
wonderful
to
meet
you
of
all
people
in
this
romantic
place
said
the
admirer
as
she
pursued
her
peas
do
you
know
whenever
i
finish
one
of
your
books
i
feel
so
romantic
i
want
to
kiss
everybody
i
meet
oh
those
courtly
heroes
of
yours
a
heavy
silence
fell
for
a
moment
and
your
descriptions
of
nature
continued
the
admirer
that
sunset
seen
from
the
west
coast
of
ireland
that
you
describe
in
courtship
of
hartley
you
must
know
ireland
very
well
i
have
never
been
there
said
gustus
i
evolve
my
scenery
after
all
nature
lives
in
the
heart
of
each
one
of
us
i
think
we
all
have
a
sort
of
secret
world
of
our
own
out
of
which
all
that
is
best
in
us
comes
one
does
not
need
to
see
with
one
outward
eyes
oh
goodness
me
how
true
that
is
said
the
admirer
but
you
must
write
a
book
about
the
downs
wo
you
do
you
take
notes
on
your
travels
my
notebook
is
never
out
of
my
hand
answered
gustus
i
jot
down
whatever
occurs
to
me
wherever
i
may
be
i
write
by
moonlight
in
the
night
i
have
had
to
pause
in
the
middle
of
my
prayers
in
church
i
have
stood
transfixed
in
the
full
flow
of
a
london
street
i
always
hope
that
people
will
think
i
am
suddenly
remembering
that
i
forgot
to
order
dinner
but
really
she
knew
that
no
one
could
ever
be
deceived
in
the
purpose
of
the
notebook
oh
must
it
be
wonderful
breathed
the
admirer
and
cousin
gustus
who
was
always
properly
impressed
by
his
wife
when
the
example
was
set
by
strangers
nodded
with
a
proprietary
smile
and
are
you
writing
now
she
continued
i
am
always
writing
said
gustus
who
had
seldom
enjoyed
herself
so
much
my
pen
never
rests
a
lifetime
is
too
short
to
allow
of
rest
but
i
am
not
here
primarily
for
inspiration
we
are
on
a
quest
oh
how
romantic
moaned
the
admirer
it
is
a
quest
with
a
certain
amount
of
romance
in
it
agreed
anonyma
we
are
seeking
a
house
by
the
sea
we
know
very
little
about
it
except
that
it
exists
we
know
that
its
windows
look
west
and
that
the
sun
sets
over
the
sea
we
know
that
it
stands
ungardened
on
the
cliff
and
has
a
great
view
we
know
that
it
is
seven
hundred
years
old
and
full
of
inspiration
we
know
continued
kew
that
you
can
and
often
do
drop
a
out
of
the
window
into
the
sea
when
you
are
tired
of
playing
the
goldfish
in
the
we
know
that
the
owner
of
the
house
is
a
rotten
shot
and
that
the
stone
balls
from
the
balustrade
are
not
at
this
moment
where
they
ought
to
be
we
know
that
aeroplanes
as
well
as
seagulls
nest
in
those
cliffs
we
know
began
russell
but
this
was
too
much
for
gustus
after
all
the
lady
was
her
admirer
what
all
this
said
gustus
what
do
you
people
know
about
it
i
just
thought
i
would
talk
a
little
now
said
kew
i
get
quickly
tired
of
hearing
other
people
giving
information
without
help
from
me
at
any
rate
russ
continued
gustus
you
ca
know
anything
whatever
about
the
matter
you
have
hardly
listened
when
i
read
jay
letters
i
told
you
that
i
remembered
said
russell
i
do
know
how
i
remember
sitting
on
a
high
cliff
and
seeing
three
black
birds
swim
in
a
row
and
dive
in
a
row
and
in
a
row
come
up
again
after
i
had
counted
hundreds
nonsense
said
gustus
trying
not
to
appear
cross
before
the
visitor
you
thinking
of
something
else
you
can
see
such
a
sight
as
that
at
the
zoo
any
day
you
all
seem
to
know
quite
a
lot
about
the
place
said
the
admirer
yet
not
much
of
a
very
practical
nature
if
i
may
say
so
everything
practical
is
unromantic
said
gustus
there
is
nothing
true
or
beautiful
in
the
world
but
poetry
if
we
seek
in
real
simplicity
of
mind
we
shall
find
what
we
seek
for
simplicity
is
poetry
and
poetry
is
truth
also
of
course
england
has
only
one
west
coast
added
kew
and
if
we
do
find
the
place
we
shall
have
found
a
good
many
other
things
by
the
time
we
have
finished
it
may
be
in
ireland
suggested
the
admirer
no
because
she
answers
our
letters
so
quickly
she
my
young
cousin
the
object
of
our
search
did
she
run
away
asked
the
admirer
in
a
voice
strangled
with
excitement
to
admit
that
a
young
relation
of
anonyma
should
run
away
from
her
would
be
undignified
you
must
take
us
too
seriously
said
gustus
lightly
it
a
case
of
an
elopement
or
anything
like
that
just
an
excuse
for
a
tour
and
a
rest
from
wearisome
war
work
a
chase
nothing
but
fun
in
it
wild
goose
is
a
good
description
of
jay
said
cousin
gustus
it
was
rather
next
morning
the
admirer
twittering
with
excitement
came
in
upon
the
family
while
it
was
having
its
breakfast
oh
i
had
such
an
idea
in
the
night
she
said
i
could
sleep
of
course
after
such
an
exciting
day
i
believe
i
have
been
fated
to
help
you
in
your
quest
i
know
of
a
house
near
here
and
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
sure
i
feel
that
it
is
the
place
you
want
who
lives
there
a
young
man
with
his
mother
i
forget
the
name
place
we
want
west
objected
russell
you
never
can
tell
said
anonyma
this
place
may
stand
on
a
salient
facing
west
our
search
must
be
thorough
it
such
a
lovely
walk
said
the
admirer
i
should
be
so
much
honoured
if
you
would
let
me
show
you
the
way
oh
i
say
do
you
think
me
very
presumptuous
her
took
the
form
of
a
constant
repentance
in
the
night
she
would
go
over
her
day
and
probe
it
for
tender
points
oh
that
was
a
dreadful
thing
to
say
was
a
refrain
that
would
keep
her
awake
for
hours
wriggling
and
giggling
in
her
bed
over
the
dreadfulness
of
it
she
had
too
little
egoism
the
lack
gave
her
face
a
look
of
littleness
a
lack
of
altruism
has
the
same
outward
effect
a
complete
face
should
be
full
of
something
of
gentleness
of
vigour
of
humour
of
wickedness
the
admirer
face
was
only
half
full
of
anything
all
the
same
there
was
charm
about
her
the
fact
that
she
was
an
admirer
was
charming
gustus
reassured
her
we
shall
be
most
grateful
for
a
guide
we
should
be
even
more
grateful
for
an
excuse
to
call
on
this
inoffensive
young
man
and
his
mother
at
eleven
in
the
morning
objected
kew
he
ought
to
be
at
the
front
was
the
excuse
provided
by
cousin
gustus
so
ought
i
sighed
kew
oh
but
you
a
wounded
are
you
asked
the
admirer
there
were
signs
of
a
possible
transfer
of
admiration
and
gustus
interposed
with
presence
of
mind
we
start
she
said
do
let
be
hampered
in
the
beginning
of
our
quest
by
social
littleness
she
was
conscious
that
she
looked
handsome
enough
for
any
breach
of
convention
she
wore
an
unusual
shaped
dress
the
colour
of
vanilla
ice
instead
of
doing
her
hair
as
usual
in
one
severe
penny
bun
at
the
back
she
had
constructed
a
halfpenny
bun
so
to
speak
over
each
ear
this
is
a
very
literary
way
of
doing
the
hair
and
the
remembrance
of
the
admirer
haunting
anonyma
waking
thoughts
had
inspired
the
change
their
way
lay
through
the
beechwood
that
embroiders
the
hem
of
the
cloak
there
are
only
two
colours
in
a
beechwood
after
rain
lilac
and
green
a
bank
of
violets
is
not
more
pure
in
colour
than
a
beech
trunk
shining
in
the
sun
the
two
colours
answered
one
another
fainter
and
fainter
away
and
away
to
the
end
of
one
sight
and
there
were
two
cuckoos
hidden
in
the
dream
mocking
each
other
in
velvet
voices
the
view
between
the
trees
was
made
up
of
horizons
that
tilted
one
chin
the
bracken
very
young
on
an
opposite
slope
was
like
a
cloud
of
green
wings
alighting
but
the
look
of
their
destination
disappointed
them
this
house
faces
south
said
kew
i
feel
sure
began
russell
but
gustus
said
as
we
are
here
we
might
ask
to
be
sure
the
cliff
is
rather
tame
but
there
is
an
aeroplane
persisted
the
admirer
now
pause
anonyma
kew
warned
her
pause
and
consider
what
you
are
going
to
say
consideration
only
unearths
difficulties
laughed
anonyma
best
go
forward
in
faith
and
fearlessness
she
was
under
the
impression
that
she
constantly
laughed
in
a
nicely
naughty
way
at
kew
excessive
conventionality
as
they
drew
nearer
to
the
cliff
it
grew
tamer
and
tamer
the
house
too
became
dangerously
like
a
villa
a
to
be
sure
and
not
in
its
first
offensive
youth
but
still
closely
connected
with
the
villa
tribe
its
complexion
was
a
bilious
yellow
and
it
had
windows
it
was
close
to
the
sea
however
and
its
windows
with
their
blinds
drawn
down
against
the
sun
looked
like
eyes
downcast
towards
the
beach
there
was
no
lodge
and
the
family
walked
in
silence
through
the
gate
russell
hound
went
first
with
a
defiant
expression
about
his
tail
that
expression
cost
him
dear
inside
the
gate
there
stood
a
large
vulgar
dog
without
a
tail
to
speak
of
its
parting
was
crooked
its
hair
was
in
its
eyes
all
these
personal
disadvantages
the
family
had
time
to
note
while
the
dog
gazed
incredulously
at
russell
hound
a
pekinese
dog
never
wears
country
clothes
it
always
looks
as
if
it
had
its
silk
hat
and
spats
on
if
i
were
a
country
dog
who
had
never
even
smelt
a
piccadilly
smell
i
should
certainly
bite
all
dogs
of
the
type
of
russell
hound
i
could
hardly
describe
what
followed
as
a
fight
although
i
have
always
loved
stories
of
from
david
downwards
and
should
much
like
to
write
one
i
can
not
in
this
case
pretend
that
russell
hound
did
anything
but
call
for
help
anonyma
umbrella
kew
cane
and
russell
stick
did
all
they
could
towards
making
peace
but
the
big
dog
seemed
to
have
set
itself
the
unkind
task
of
mopping
up
a
puddle
with
russell
hound
the
process
took
a
considerable
time
and
it
was
never
finished
for
the
mistress
of
the
house
interrupted
it
she
was
rather
a
fat
person
apparently
possessing
the
gift
of
authority
for
the
sound
of
her
call
reached
her
dog
through
the
noise
of
battle
he
saw
that
his
aim
was
not
one
to
achieve
in
the
presence
of
an
audience
he
disengaged
his
teeth
from
the
mane
of
russell
hound
is
your
dog
much
hurt
asked
the
mistress
of
the
house
and
handed
anonyma
a
slate
anonyma
scanned
this
unexpected
gift
nervously
she
was
much
more
used
to
taking
other
people
aback
than
to
being
taken
aback
herself
but
kew
was
more
ready
he
dived
for
the
pencil
and
wrote
only
a
bit
punctured
on
the
slate
you
better
bring
it
in
and
bathe
it
suggested
the
lady
when
she
had
studied
this
they
followed
her
in
silent
single
file
anonyma
noticed
that
her
hair
was
apparently
done
in
imitation
of
a
pigeon
nest
also
that
many
hooks
at
the
back
of
her
dress
had
lost
their
grip
of
the
situation
the
bathroom
whither
russell
hound
was
carried
was
suggestive
of
another
presence
in
the
house
a
boat
called
mary
was
navigating
the
bath
there
were
some
prostrate
soldiers
and
chessmen
in
a
little
heap
on
the
ledge
apparently
waiting
for
a
passage
i
getting
out
my
son
things
because
he
is
coming
home
said
the
lady
russell
was
bathing
his
bleeding
hound
in
the
basin
and
anonyma
was
at
the
window
ostentatiously
drinking
in
the
view
kew
took
the
slate
and
wrote
politely
on
it
from
school
from
the
war
said
the
lady
kew
donned
a
pleased
and
interested
expression
it
seemed
to
him
better
to
do
this
than
to
write
really
on
the
slate
he
wrote
about
a
fortnight
ago
the
lady
harsh
voice
continued
to
say
he
would
come
he
said
he
was
sick
of
being
he
told
me
to
get
out
the
soldiers
and
the
he
wants
to
launch
them
on
the
pond
again
kew
nodded
i
have
felt
like
that
he
murmured
and
the
lady
seemed
to
see
the
sense
of
his
words
i
should
think
you
are
six
years
older
than
murray
she
said
and
very
different
come
out
into
the
garden
and
i
show
you
kew
followed
her
and
anonyma
after
a
moment
hesitation
went
too
but
russell
who
had
finished
his
work
of
mercy
seemed
to
think
it
better
to
linger
in
the
bathroom
explaining
to
his
hound
the
subject
of
a
biblical
picture
which
hung
over
the
bath
you
might
think
i
was
rather
too
old
to
play
things
well
the
mother
said
to
kew
but
you
should
see
me
with
murray
even
my
deafness
never
hindered
me
with
him
i
could
always
see
what
he
said
look
we
made
this
road
for
the
soldiers
coming
down
to
the
wharf
do
you
see
the
way
we
helped
nature
by
tampering
with
the
roots
of
the
beech
it
is
a
perfect
wharf
this
little
flat
bit
it
is
just
level
with
the
deck
of
the
boat
at
high
tide
the
lower
wharf
is
for
low
tide
but
of
course
we
have
to
pretend
the
tides
that
round
place
is
the
bandstand
and
there
the
pipers
play
when
there
is
a
starting
sometimes
only
the
favourite
piper
plays
striding
up
and
down
the
little
at
the
top
here
but
not
often
because
the
work
of
keeping
him
going
interferes
with
the
disembarkation
we
never
let
the
highlanders
go
abroad
because
murray
loves
them
so
he
is
afraid
lest
something
should
happen
to
them
were
the
highlanders
your
favourites
kew
wrote
on
the
slate
no
the
egyptian
camel
corps
the
lady
nodded
we
loved
them
too
but
of
course
they
lived
on
the
other
side
of
the
pond
and
sometimes
they
and
the
sepoys
and
the
soudanese
had
to
insurrect
somebody
had
to
you
know
but
we
regretted
the
egyptian
camel
corps
awfully
i
hope
you
do
think
us
silly
murray
was
always
a
childish
person
i
hope
i
am
too
the
gave
us
a
lot
of
trouble
to
make
it
is
nice
and
flat
is
it
we
trim
it
with
it
was
a
good
about
twelve
inches
by
six
there
were
some
marbles
on
it
it
has
historical
associations
said
the
mother
of
murray
it
was
here
that
drake
played
when
the
armada
was
sighted
of
course
that
was
before
our
time
but
sometimes
on
a
moonlit
summer
night
we
used
to
lie
down
on
our
fronts
and
see
his
little
ghost
haunting
the
green
we
used
to
bring
our
young
sailors
here
and
inspire
them
with
stories
about
drake
the
sailors
used
to
stand
on
the
green
and
we
put
up
railings
made
of
matches
all
round
and
civilians
used
to
stand
in
great
breathless
crowds
outside
the
railings
watching
chessmen
of
course
murray
used
to
make
the
civilians
arrive
in
motors
so
as
to
make
ruts
in
the
road
somehow
it
was
always
rather
splendid
and
real
to
have
ruts
in
the
road
there
was
a
long
pause
later
on
of
course
things
got
more
the
last
time
we
played
before
the
war
when
war
was
already
in
sight
we
shipped
an
unprecedented
mass
of
troops
to
that
peninsula
and
had
a
wonderful
battle
you
can
still
see
the
trenches
and
gun
emplacements
i
cleared
them
out
yesterday
murray
joined
the
army
in
that
first
august
and
whenever
he
came
home
after
that
he
was
somehow
ashamed
of
these
things
i
quite
understood
that
when
i
am
having
tea
with
the
vicar
wife
or
cutting
out
shirts
for
the
soldiers
i
sometimes
blush
a
little
to
think
how
old
i
am
and
to
think
of
the
things
i
do
at
home
with
murray
i
am
sure
he
felt
just
the
same
when
he
was
with
other
men
but
his
last
letter
was
young
again
he
wrote
that
the
war
should
cease
the
moment
he
set
foot
inside
this
gate
and
we
would
have
a
civilian
game
an
alpine
expedition
up
the
mountains
you
see
the
mountains
there
is
the
cave
where
we
put
up
for
the
night
there
is
a
wonderful
view
from
bumpy
peak
over
the
sea
and
right
away
to
lands
murray
thought
that
when
the
expedition
had
caught
a
chamois
it
might
turn
into
engineers
prospecting
for
the
building
of
a
road
up
to
bumpy
peak
so
that
the
soldiers
might
march
up
and
look
out
over
the
sea
and
see
very
far
off
the
fringes
of
the
east
that
they
had
conquered
when
they
were
young
and
not
tired
of
war
she
broke
off
and
looked
at
kew
anonyma
stood
a
few
paces
away
gazing
at
her
reflection
in
the
pond
i
dare
say
you
think
us
silly
said
the
lady
i
dare
say
you
would
think
murray
a
rotter
if
you
met
him
it
does
matter
much
it
matter
at
all
nothing
matters
because
he
will
come
home
kew
fidgeted
a
moment
and
then
took
the
slate
and
wrote
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
all
leave
from
abroad
has
been
stopped
this
week
yes
i
know
said
the
mother
i
have
been
unhappy
about
that
for
some
days
but
it
does
make
any
difference
to
murray
now
you
see
i
heard
last
night
that
he
was
killed
on
tuesday
that
why
i
know
he
will
come
and
i
shall
be
waiting
here
ca
you
imagine
them
shouting
as
they
get
through
as
they
get
through
with
being
shouting
to
each
other
as
they
run
back
to
their
childhood
and
their
old
pretences
after
a
moment
she
added
that
is
the
only
sound
that
i
shall
ever
hear
now
the
shouting
of
murray
to
me
as
he
runs
home
it
was
in
a
sort
of
dream
that
kew
watched
anonyma
go
forward
and
take
both
the
hands
of
the
mother
i
suppose
he
knew
that
all
that
was
superfluous
and
that
murray
would
come
home
anonyma
said
i
am
so
sorry
i
am
so
sorry
that
we
intruded
you
must
forgive
us
the
mother
of
murray
did
not
hear
but
she
saw
that
sympathy
was
intended
and
she
nodded
awkwardly
and
a
little
severely
i
do
think
she
had
known
that
anonyma
was
there
kew
was
not
sorry
that
he
had
intruded
at
sunset
when
the
high
sea
span
about
the
rocks
a
web
of
foam
i
saw
the
ghost
of
a
cornishman
come
home
i
saw
the
ghost
of
a
cornishman
run
from
the
weariness
of
war
i
heard
him
laughing
as
he
ran
across
his
unforgotten
shore
the
great
cliff
gilded
by
the
west
received
him
as
an
honoured
guest
the
green
sea
shining
in
the
bay
did
drown
his
dreadful
yesterday
come
home
come
home
you
million
ghosts
the
honest
years
shall
make
amends
the
sun
and
moon
shall
be
your
hosts
the
everlasting
hills
your
friends
and
some
shall
seek
their
mothers
faces
and
some
shall
run
to
and
some
to
towns
and
others
yet
shall
find
great
forests
in
their
debt
oh
i
would
siege
the
golden
coasts
of
space
and
climb
high
heaven
dome
so
i
might
see
those
million
ghosts
come
home
next
day
all
the
family
including
russell
and
excepting
cousin
gustus
came
to
breakfast
with
the
intention
of
announcing
that
he
or
she
must
go
up
to
london
by
the
next
train
gustus
as
ever
spoke
first
my
conscience
is
pricking
me
my
work
is
calling
me
i
must
go
up
and
see
my
old
darlings
in
the
brown
borough
there
is
i
see
a
train
at
ten
i
was
just
going
to
say
something
quite
different
to
the
same
effect
said
kew
i
want
to
go
up
and
whisper
some
secrets
into
the
ear
of
cox
i
want
to
have
my
hair
cut
i
want
to
buy
this
week
i
want
some
brown
bootlaces
life
is
empty
for
me
unless
i
go
up
to
town
this
morning
russell
although
he
had
tried
the
effect
of
all
his
excuses
on
his
hound
while
dressing
was
silent
gustus
was
never
less
than
half
an
hour
too
early
for
trains
this
might
account
for
the
excellence
of
her
general
information
she
had
spent
a
large
portion
of
her
life
at
railway
stations
which
are
i
think
the
centre
of
much
wisdom
she
and
kew
started
for
the
station
with
mouths
burnt
by
hurried
coffee
and
still
unbrushed
on
their
waistcoats
forty
minutes
before
the
train
was
due
the
protests
of
kew
could
be
heard
almost
as
far
as
the
station
which
was
reached
by
a
walk
of
five
minutes
cousin
gustus
russell
and
the
convalescent
hound
went
to
lie
upon
the
downs
which
climbed
up
straight
from
the
back
doorstep
of
the
inn
they
were
accompanied
by
a
rug
a
scarf
a
sunshade
an
overcoat
the
blessings
of
the
landlady
and
cousin
gustus
diary
nobody
ever
knew
what
sort
of
matter
filled
cousin
gustus
diary
nobody
ever
wanted
to
know
it
gave
him
grounds
for
claiming
literary
tastes
and
his
literary
tastes
presumably
made
him
marry
a
literary
wife
so
the
diary
had
a
certain
importance
they
spread
out
the
rug
in
a
little
hollow
like
a
giant
footprint
in
the
downs
and
sheep
and
various
small
flowers
looked
over
their
shoulders
for
the
first
ten
minutes
russell
lay
on
his
back
listening
to
the
busy
sound
of
the
bees
filling
their
honeybags
and
the
sheep
filling
themselves
and
cousin
gustus
filling
his
diary
he
watched
the
rooks
travel
across
the
varied
country
of
the
sky
he
watched
a
little
black
and
white
bird
that
danced
in
the
air
to
the
tune
of
its
own
very
high
and
flippant
song
he
watched
the
sun
ford
a
deep
and
foaming
cloud
and
all
the
time
he
remembered
many
reasons
why
it
would
have
been
nice
to
go
up
to
london
oddly
enough
a
seemed
to
stand
quite
apart
from
these
reasons
in
the
back
of
his
mind
for
several
minutes
one
would
hardly
have
believed
that
a
could
have
held
her
own
so
long
in
the
mind
of
a
person
like
russell
and
providence
finally
ordained
that
he
should
feel
in
his
cigarette
case
and
find
it
empty
no
cigarettes
said
russell
after
pondering
for
a
moment
on
this
disappointment
you
smoke
too
much
said
cousin
gustus
i
once
knew
a
man
who
all
his
life
and
when
he
got
a
bullet
in
his
lung
in
the
zulu
war
he
died
simply
as
the
result
of
his
foolishness
no
recuperative
power
they
said
his
lungs
were
simply
leather
should
have
thought
that
would
been
a
protection
said
russell
the
train
is
not
even
signalled
yet
said
cousin
gustus
you
would
have
time
to
go
to
the
station
and
tell
kew
to
get
you
some
cigarettes
but
this
was
not
providence
intention
as
interpreted
by
russell
know
i
half
believe
i
go
up
too
he
said
would
you
be
lonely
not
in
the
least
said
cousin
gustus
pathetically
i
used
to
being
left
alone
as
the
signals
dropped
russell
sprang
to
his
feet
and
ran
down
the
slope
he
had
country
clothes
on
and
some
thistledown
and
a
sprig
or
two
of
clover
were
sticking
to
them
he
reached
the
station
in
time
and
fell
over
a
crate
of
hens
the
hens
were
furious
about
it
and
said
so
russell
said
nothing
but
he
felt
hurt
when
the
porter
who
opened
the
door
for
him
asked
if
the
hens
were
his
after
the
train
had
started
he
wished
he
had
had
time
to
tell
the
porter
how
impossible
it
was
that
a
man
who
owned
a
crate
full
of
hens
should
fall
over
it
and
then
he
thought
that
would
have
been
neither
witty
nor
convincing
he
was
one
of
those
lucky
people
who
say
so
little
that
they
rarely
have
need
to
regret
what
they
have
said
the
business
that
dragged
him
so
precipitately
from
the
country
must
i
suppose
have
been
very
urgent
it
chanced
that
it
lay
at
ludgate
circus
and
it
also
chanced
not
in
the
least
unnaturally
that
at
eleven
he
was
standing
at
kensington
church
waiting
to
be
beckoned
to
once
more
by
a
the
only
unnatural
thing
was
that
several
bound
for
ludgate
circus
passed
without
winning
the
patronage
of
russell
the
conductor
came
russell
saw
her
round
face
and
squared
hair
appear
out
of
the
confusion
of
the
street
he
noticed
with
surprise
that
he
had
not
borne
in
mind
the
pleasing
way
in
which
the
strap
of
her
hat
tilted
her
already
tilted
chin
jay
had
been
thinking
a
little
about
russell
not
much
she
had
been
wondering
who
he
was
the
family
friends
and
relations
were
always
much
talked
of
in
the
family
and
much
invited
and
much
met
russell
had
not
been
among
them
when
jay
had
last
known
the
family
an
idea
was
in
her
mind
that
he
might
be
a
private
detective
engaged
by
the
family
to
seek
out
their
fugitive
young
relation
russell
had
plainly
alluded
to
a
search
jay
had
no
experience
of
private
detectives
but
she
thought
it
quite
possible
that
they
might
disguise
themselves
with
rather
low
foreheads
and
rather
frowning
eyes
and
shut
thin
mouths
and
shut
thin
expressions
she
hoped
that
she
would
see
him
an
hour
ago
a
young
man
with
a
spotty
complexion
and
bulging
eyes
like
a
rabbit
had
handed
her
a
note
with
his
threepence
asking
for
a
in
a
lovelorn
voice
she
handed
him
back
his
halfpenny
and
his
unopened
note
at
once
saying
your
change
sir
in
a
kind
voice
i
am
afraid
an
incident
like
this
is
always
a
little
exciting
though
i
admit
it
ought
to
be
insulting
that
suggestive
fare
made
jay
hope
more
and
more
that
she
would
meet
russell
i
do
exactly
know
why
except
that
sentimentality
is
an
infectious
complaint
russell
got
happily
into
the
he
made
the
worst
entrance
possible
his
hat
slipped
crooked
he
left
one
leg
behind
on
the
road
and
only
retrieved
it
with
the
help
of
the
conductor
jay
welcomed
him
with
a
nod
that
was
almost
a
bow
a
remnant
of
her
unprofessional
past
told
you
i
come
in
this
again
said
russell
sitting
down
in
the
seat
next
to
the
door
i
really
do
know
what
would
have
happened
if
that
seat
had
been
occupied
i
suppose
russell
would
have
sat
upon
the
occupier
a
good
many
people
like
this
service
said
jay
it
is
considered
very
convenient
how
is
your
search
going
it
has
begun
yet
said
russell
we
have
got
within
three
hundred
miles
of
the
house
we
looking
for
you
know
more
or
less
where
it
is
then
asked
jay
who
sometimes
wanted
to
know
this
herself
i
do
know
but
i
do
know
how
i
know
nor
what
i
know
how
funny
that
you
an
older
and
wiser
man
should
feel
that
sort
of
knowledge
said
jay
as
an
afterthought
she
called
him
sir
the
grew
fuller
and
only
jay
bell
punctured
the
silence
that
followed
a
lady
asked
jay
to
set
her
down
at
charing
cross
post
office
the
stops
there
automatically
madam
said
jay
and
the
lady
told
her
not
to
be
impertinent
jay
seemed
a
little
subdued
after
this
and
it
was
only
after
she
had
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
on
her
platform
in
silence
that
she
said
to
russell
london
seems
dead
does
it
not
even
fog
only
a
lifeless
light
what
the
use
of
daylight
in
london
you
know
i
do
live
in
london
no
said
russell
where
do
you
live
london
replied
jay
i
mean
my
heart
does
live
in
london
mostly
i
think
it
lives
very
far
away
in
the
same
sort
of
place
as
the
place
you
know
without
knowing
how
you
know
it
the
happy
shore
of
god
knows
where
must
have
a
great
population
of
hearts
i
hate
london
so
that
i
could
tear
it
into
pieces
like
a
rag
you
ought
to
start
your
on
the
search
for
the
happy
shore
said
russell
you
find
the
track
of
my
tyres
before
you
i
you
find
the
place
well
that
would
be
the
only
perfect
service
said
jay
but
i
believe
the
public
would
use
the
route
much
i
would
go
on
and
on
and
leave
all
old
ruts
behind
i
would
stop
for
no
fares
even
the
sea
should
not
stop
me
i
would
go
on
to
the
horizon
to
see
if
that
secret
look
just
after
sunset
really
means
that
the
stars
are
just
over
the
brink
why
do
people
end
themselves
on
a
note
of
despair
i
would
choose
that
way
of
perpetuating
my
perfect
day
the
police
would
see
the
top
seats
of
the
sticking
out
at
low
tide
and
the
verdict
would
be
while
of
even
more
than
usually
unsound
mind
a
has
an
unromantic
voice
the
bass
is
a
snarl
and
the
treble
is
made
up
of
a
shrill
rattle
it
was
curious
how
this
managed
to
retain
withal
its
fantastic
atmosphere
russell
asked
presently
why
are
you
a
to
get
some
money
replied
the
conductor
baldly
i
want
to
find
out
what
is
the
attraction
of
money
besides
if
one
talks
such
a
lot
as
i
do
to
do
anything
however
small
saves
one
from
being
utterly
futile
when
i
get
to
heaven
the
angels
wo
be
able
to
say
tush
you
lived
on
the
charity
of
god
that
what
unearned
money
is
is
it
and
what
the
use
of
charity
do
you
ever
get
a
day
off
asked
russell
occasionally
will
you
meet
me
on
the
steps
of
paul
next
sunday
at
ten
no
because
i
shall
be
at
work
next
sunday
will
you
meet
me
the
sunday
after
that
yes
said
jay
the
family
theories
on
the
bringing
up
of
girls
had
evidently
been
wasted
on
her
what
the
use
of
looking
for
this
girl
she
asked
after
a
round
of
duty
why
not
leave
her
on
her
happy
shore
do
you
know
sir
i
sympathise
enormously
with
that
girl
i
do
expect
you
would
if
you
knew
her
said
russell
she
must
be
quite
different
from
you
by
what
i
hear
from
her
relations
i
think
she
must
be
an
aggressive
suffragetty
sort
of
girl
girls
nowadays
seem
to
find
running
away
from
home
a
sufficient
profession
you
say
that
because
you
are
so
dreadfully
much
older
and
wiser
said
jay
why
are
you
looking
for
her
then
i
not
said
russell
she
is
just
a
trespasser
i
looking
for
the
place
because
i
know
i
know
it
i
hope
you
never
find
it
said
jay
crossly
she
announced
ludgate
circus
in
a
startling
voice
and
ended
the
conversation
she
was
tired
because
she
had
been
up
all
night
among
distressed
friends
in
the
brown
borough
there
had
been
a
fight
in
tann
street
had
broken
the
face
of
little
love
love
had
never
fought
before
her
fists
were
like
lamb
cutlets
and
she
had
had
a
good
mother
with
principles
all
these
things
are
drawbacks
in
a
brown
borough
argument
but
love
was
a
friend
of
jay
and
i
do
think
she
had
found
that
a
drawback
feverish
discussions
with
dreadfully
impartial
policemen
feverish
drying
of
feverish
tears
feverish
extracting
of
medicaments
from
closed
chemists
and
finally
a
feverish
triumph
of
words
with
which
jay
capped
triumph
of
fists
were
the
items
in
the
sum
of
a
feverish
night
so
jay
was
tired
russell
was
too
early
for
his
business
and
he
went
into
and
sat
on
a
seat
far
back
paul
was
an
i
think
who
very
badly
needed
to
get
married
and
be
answered
back
now
and
then
i
believe
it
is
possible
that
he
was
unworthy
of
that
great
house
called
by
his
name
the
gospel
of
a
very
splendid
detachment
speaks
within
its
walls
its
windows
turn
inward
its
music
sings
to
itself
tossed
city
sinners
go
in
and
out
and
pass
and
penetrate
but
still
the
music
dreams
and
still
the
dim
gold
blinks
above
their
heads
a
muffled
god
walks
the
aisles
and
you
in
the
bristling
wilderness
of
chairs
can
clutch
at
his
skirts
and
never
see
his
eyes
nothing
comes
forward
from
that
altar
to
meet
you
it
is
as
if
he
walked
talking
to
himself
and
as
if
even
his
speech
were
lost
in
those
devouring
spaces
russell
sat
near
the
door
and
found
only
his
thoughts
and
the
shuffle
of
seeking
feet
to
keep
him
company
an
older
and
wiser
man
he
thought
god
forgive
me
for
letting
it
pass
if
he
had
thought
it
worth
while
to
profess
an
ism
at
all
he
would
have
been
a
fatalist
he
was
the
victim
of
an
unwitty
cynicism
and
of
a
heavy
irresponsibility
he
applied
either
it
is
worth
while
or
it
does
matter
to
everything
he
never
expressed
his
thoughts
to
himself
it
was
not
worth
while
but
i
think
he
knew
within
himself
that
life
was
made
of
paper
and
thrown
together
in
a
crackling
chaos
there
was
no
depth
in
anything
and
a
mere
thought
could
slay
the
highest
thing
in
the
world
the
only
thing
that
ever
made
his
heart
laugh
was
the
idea
of
fineness
finding
place
in
himself
a
dream
of
himself
in
a
heroic
light
sometimes
made
him
poke
himself
in
the
ribs
and
mock
the
farce
of
human
vanity
he
was
like
a
man
in
a
world
that
lacked
mirrors
a
man
who
sees
his
dark
deformed
shadow
on
the
sands
and
thinks
it
represents
him
fairly
he
was
without
knowing
that
he
was
not
worth
his
own
recognition
at
home
he
often
recited
little
confused
poems
of
his
own
composition
to
his
hound
and
never
noticed
the
surprise
of
the
servants
he
never
knew
that
in
the
company
of
and
gustus
and
kew
he
was
hardly
allowed
to
utter
three
consecutive
words
although
when
he
was
away
from
them
and
especially
when
he
was
with
the
he
felt
a
delightful
lack
of
restraint
as
he
sat
down
and
looked
at
the
far
unanswering
altar
he
had
two
dim
thoughts
one
was
that
a
man
might
get
older
and
wiser
without
getting
old
enough
or
wise
enough
to
choose
his
road
the
other
was
a
question
as
to
whether
it
is
ever
really
worth
while
to
read
what
the
signpost
says
from
the
moment
when
russell
left
her
jay
became
stupefied
by
an
invasion
of
the
secret
world
she
gave
the
tickets
and
change
with
accuracy
she
kept
count
of
the
stream
of
climbers
on
to
the
top
of
the
she
stilled
the
angry
whirlpool
of
people
on
the
pavement
for
whom
there
was
no
room
she
dislodged
passengers
at
the
corners
of
their
own
streets
even
that
gentleman
almost
always
to
be
found
in
an
obscure
corner
of
an
who
had
sunk
into
a
sudden
and
pathetic
sleep
just
when
his
pennyworth
of
ride
was
coming
to
an
end
she
received
an
unexpected
inspector
with
the
smile
that
comes
of
knowing
every
passenger
to
be
properly
ticketed
she
even
laughed
at
his
joke
she
weeded
out
the
whitechapel
jewesses
at
the
bank
and
introduced
them
to
the
mile
end
she
handed
out
to
them
their
sombre
and
babies
and
when
one
mother
thanked
her
profusely
in
yiddish
she
replied
bitte
bitte
yet
all
the
while
the
wind
blew
to
her
old
remembrances
of
the
low
chimneys
and
the
bending
roofs
of
the
house
by
the
sea
and
the
smell
of
the
high
curving
fields
and
the
shouting
of
the
sea
and
all
the
while
her
hands
must
grope
for
the
handle
of
the
heavy
door
and
her
eyes
must
fill
with
blindness
because
of
the
wonderful
promise
of
distant
cliffs
with
the
sun
on
them
and
because
the
sea
was
so
shining
and
all
the
while
her
ears
must
strain
to
hear
a
voice
within
the
house
it
is
a
very
great
honour
to
be
given
two
lives
to
live
the
monotonous
journeys
trod
on
each
other
heels
slowly
the
day
consumed
itself
it
grew
dimmer
and
dimmer
for
jay
though
i
have
no
doubt
that
habit
protected
her
and
that
she
behaved
herself
throughout
with
commonplace
correctness
she
found
presently
that
the
great
weight
of
copper
money
was
gone
from
her
shoulder
and
that
it
was
evening
and
that
chloris
was
coming
down
mabel
place
to
meet
her
chloris
was
wagging
her
whole
person
from
the
backwards
she
never
found
adequate
the
tail
that
had
originally
been
provided
for
that
purpose
jay
stumbled
up
the
step
of
eighteen
mabel
place
and
found
at
last
the
path
she
wanted
the
path
was
one
that
had
never
been
touched
by
a
professional
pathmaker
feet
not
hands
had
made
it
the
rocks
impatiently
thrust
it
aside
every
little
way
and
here
and
there
were
steps
up
and
down
for
no
reason
except
that
the
rock
would
have
it
so
the
path
chose
its
way
so
that
you
might
see
the
sea
from
every
inch
of
it
the
thundering
headlands
sprang
from
jay
left
hand
and
she
could
see
the
cliffs
written
over
with
strange
lines
and
the
shadow
that
they
cast
upon
deep
water
it
was
the
colour
of
a
great
passion
and
against
that
colour
pink
foxgloves
bowed
dramatically
upon
the
fringe
of
space
the
white
gulls
were
in
the
valleys
of
the
sea
i
wish
colour
could
be
built
by
words
i
wish
i
could
speak
colour
to
myself
in
the
dark
i
can
never
fill
my
eyes
full
enough
of
the
colour
of
the
sea
nor
my
ears
of
the
crying
of
the
seagulls
i
am
most
greedy
of
these
things
and
take
no
thought
for
the
morrow
so
that
if
my
morrow
dawns
darkly
i
have
nothing
stored
away
to
comfort
me
the
path
joins
the
more
civilised
road
almost
at
the
door
of
the
house
by
the
sea
you
tumble
over
a
great
round
rock
that
still
bears
the
marks
of
the
sea
fingers
and
you
are
at
the
door
the
house
was
full
of
sunlight
great
panels
of
sunlight
lay
across
the
air
the
fingers
of
the
honeysuckle
in
the
rough
painted
bowl
by
the
window
caught
and
held
sunlight
in
every
room
of
the
house
you
can
always
hear
the
eternal
march
of
the
sea
up
and
down
the
shore
nothing
ever
drowns
that
measured
confusion
sometimes
the
voices
of
friends
thread
in
and
out
of
it
sometimes
the
dogs
bark
or
a
coming
meal
clinks
in
the
stone
passage
or
you
can
catch
the
squealing
of
the
children
in
their
baths
sometimes
your
heart
stops
beating
to
listen
to
the
speech
of
the
ghosts
that
haunt
the
house
but
no
sound
ever
usurps
the
throne
of
the
sea
they
were
all
on
the
stairs
the
secret
friend
and
the
children
they
all
wore
untidy
clothes
and
eggs
bulged
from
their
pockets
the
secret
friend
has
red
hair
you
might
call
its
colour
vulgar
but
jay
likes
it
very
much
he
hardly
ever
sits
still
you
can
never
see
him
think
he
has
a
way
of
answering
you
almost
before
you
have
finished
speaking
his
mind
always
seems
to
be
exploring
among
words
and
sometimes
you
can
hear
him
telling
himself
splendid
sentences
without
meaning
for
this
reason
everything
connected
with
him
has
a
name
from
his
dog
which
is
called
trelawney
to
the
last
cigarette
he
smokes
at
night
which
is
called
isobel
this
trick
jay
has
imported
into
her
own
establishment
she
has
an
umbrella
called
macdonald
and
a
little
occasional
pleurisy
pain
under
one
rib
which
she
introduces
to
the
family
as
julia
the
children
in
the
house
were
just
those
very
children
that
every
woman
hopes
or
has
hoped
to
have
for
her
own
they
were
just
starting
for
a
walk
and
the
secret
friend
was
finishing
a
story
how
can
you
remember
things
that
happened
i
suppose
squillions
of
years
ago
said
the
eldest
child
you
tell
them
as
if
they
happened
yesterday
does
it
seem
as
if
all
the
happiest
things
happened
yesterday
to
me
it
seems
that
they
will
happen
said
the
secret
friend
but
then
there
is
so
little
difference
between
yesterday
and
how
can
you
tell
which
is
which
only
clocks
and
calendars
are
silly
enough
to
tread
on
the
tail
of
a
little
space
between
sunrise
and
sunset
and
call
it
how
do
you
know
which
way
up
time
is
happening
because
yesterday
the
sun
set
and
we
went
to
bed
said
the
youngest
child
i
think
is
a
little
person
in
dark
clothes
watching
and
listening
said
the
eldest
child
and
is
cinderella
all
shiny
and
beautiful
until
twelve
strikes
all
yesterdays
and
all
are
in
this
house
listening
said
the
secret
friend
this
is
the
place
where
time
is
without
a
name
here
the
beginning
comes
after
the
end
we
shall
be
born
yesterday
we
died
was
just
a
little
passage
built
of
odd
hours
and
now
we
will
sing
the
loud
song
they
were
on
the
rocky
path
now
and
they
sang
the
loud
song
both
that
path
and
that
song
go
on
for
ever
and
the
words
of
the
song
are
like
this
there
is
no
house
like
our
house
even
in
heaven
there
is
no
family
like
our
family
even
in
heaven
there
is
no
country
like
our
country
even
in
heaven
there
is
no
sea
like
our
sea
even
in
heaven
most
families
sing
this
song
more
or
less
but
few
could
sing
it
so
loudly
as
this
family
did
the
dog
trelawney
ran
after
the
shadows
of
the
seagulls
there
is
the
track
my
feet
have
worn
by
which
my
fate
may
find
me
from
that
dim
place
where
i
was
born
those
footprints
run
behind
me
uncertain
was
the
trail
i
left
for
oh
the
way
was
stormy
but
now
this
splendid
sea
has
cleft
my
journey
from
before
me
three
things
the
sea
shall
never
end
three
things
shall
mock
its
power
my
singing
soul
my
secret
friend
and
this
my
perfect
hour
and
you
shall
seek
me
till
you
reach
the
tangled
tide
advancing
and
you
shall
find
upon
the
beach
the
traces
of
my
dancing
and
in
the
air
the
happy
speech
of
secret
friends
romancing
for
some
minutes
some
one
had
been
knocking
on
the
door
the
sound
was
like
an
intruder
in
the
secret
world
beckoning
insistently
to
jay
but
she
took
no
notice
of
it
until
a
loud
voice
said
you
need
not
think
you
are
paddling
in
golden
seas
and
inaccessible
to
your
relations
because
you
are
here
and
i
can
see
you
through
the
window
after
a
moment
confusion
jay
found
that
this
was
so
and
she
got
up
and
let
kew
in
i
will
just
ask
you
how
you
are
he
said
hurriedly
and
how
things
are
going
in
the
other
world
and
all
that
but
you
need
answer
because
i
have
much
time
and
i
want
very
badly
to
talk
about
myself
i
never
get
a
chance
when
anonyma
is
there
and
when
i
return
to
france
which
is
likely
to
happen
soon
i
sha
find
much
chance
to
talk
there
i
am
so
glad
i
am
going
back
i
am
so
sick
of
hearing
other
people
talk
about
things
that
are
not
worth
mentioning
poor
dear
anonyma
she
meant
all
this
recent
gaiety
as
a
reward
to
me
for
war
work
dutifully
done
but
if
this
be
jam
give
me
my
next
pill
unadorned
a
motor
tour
combined
with
anonyma
is
tiring
if
i
were
alone
with
russ
i
might
enjoy
it
who
is
russ
the
owner
of
christina
and
christina
is
the
vehicle
which
contains
us
during
the
search
for
you
he
became
aware
of
the
velvet
face
of
chloris
gazing
at
him
from
between
his
knees
what
does
chloris
do
while
you
are
in
heaven
do
you
take
her
with
you
there
is
already
a
dog
there
called
trelawney
by
jove
that
would
make
a
nice
little
clue
for
anonyma
there
can
be
only
one
dog
on
the
called
trelawney
we
could
stop
and
ask
every
dog
we
met
what
its
name
was
besides
the
name
suggests
cornwall
what
breed
is
the
dog
look
here
will
you
write
the
family
a
letter
giving
it
a
few
neat
clues
for
anonyma
after
all
we
ought
to
give
her
all
the
pleasure
we
can
i
sometimes
think
we
are
a
disappointing
family
for
her
to
have
married
we
lie
to
her
she
lies
to
us
her
enthusiasms
make
us
smile
behind
our
hands
ours
make
her
yawn
behind
her
notebook
send
us
a
good
encouraging
letter
addressed
to
the
house
in
kensington
we
always
wire
our
address
there
as
we
move
give
us
details
about
trelawney
and
if
possible
the
name
of
the
nearest
post
town
if
we
must
lie
let
us
give
all
the
pleasure
we
can
by
doing
so
poor
old
anonyma
it
getting
dark
i
must
go
back
to
the
family
i
am
as
a
babe
in
the
hands
of
anonyma
and
like
a
babe
i
promised
her
i
would
be
back
before
dark
do
you
remember
how
we
used
to
long
to
be
lost
after
nightfall
just
for
the
dramatic
effect
yet
we
were
awfully
frightened
of
the
dark
do
you
remember
how
we
used
to
dare
each
other
to
get
out
of
bed
and
run
three
times
round
the
night
nursery
i
have
never
felt
so
brave
since
as
i
used
to
feel
as
i
jumped
into
bed
conscious
of
an
ordeal
creditably
over
why
is
bed
such
a
safe
place
i
am
not
half
so
brave
as
i
used
to
be
i
remember
at
the
age
of
ten
doing
a
thing
that
i
have
never
dared
to
do
since
i
sat
in
the
bath
with
my
back
to
the
taps
do
you
suppose
the
innocent
designer
of
baths
meant
everybody
to
sit
like
that
with
a
tap
looking
over
each
shoulder
taps
are
known
to
be
savage
brutes
and
it
is
everybody
instinct
to
sit
the
other
way
round
and
keep
an
eye
on
the
danger
if
i
were
as
brave
now
as
i
was
at
ten
i
could
probably
win
the
war
oh
jay
i
ca
stop
talking
i
am
so
pleased
to
be
nearly
out
of
the
clutches
of
my
relations
are
you
sure
you
wo
be
killed
asked
jay
suddenly
i
ca
be
said
kew
how
could
i
be
i
me
i
not
brave
and
i
do
go
to
france
with
one
eye
on
duty
and
the
other
on
the
possibility
of
never
coming
back
i
go
because
the
crowd
goes
and
the
crowd
a
rather
shrunken
crowd
will
come
back
safe
i
too
average
a
man
to
get
killed
do
you
think
all
those
million
ghosts
are
thinking
business
had
death
to
choose
me
suggested
jay
no
said
kew
i
sure
they
know
after
a
few
seconds
pause
he
said
by
jove
are
you
in
fancy
dress
no
why
why
indeed
why
a
kilt
and
yards
of
gaiters
why
a
hat
like
a
colonial
horse
marine
oh
this
is
the
uniform
of
a
replied
jay
kew
scanned
it
with
distaste
presently
he
said
do
you
think
you
better
give
it
up
buy
a
new
hat
with
a
day
earnings
and
get
the
sack
i
ca
quarrel
with
my
bread
and
butter
said
jay
surely
this
is
only
jam
said
kew
you
got
plenty
of
money
of
your
own
for
bread
and
butter
i
have
now
answered
jay
i
gave
up
having
money
when
the
war
started
perhaps
i
chucked
it
into
the
serpentine
perhaps
not
i
forget
kew
got
up
slowly
well
he
said
sure
you
all
right
i
must
be
going
i
do
know
when
the
last
train
goes
in
london
it
is
impossible
to
ignore
the
fact
that
you
are
late
the
hands
of
clocks
point
out
your
guilt
whichever
way
you
look
your
eye
and
your
ear
are
accused
on
every
side
you
long
for
the
courteous
clocklessness
of
the
country
there
mercifully
the
sun
neither
ticks
nor
strikes
nor
cavils
at
the
minutes
there
was
a
crowd
of
at
brown
borough
church
and
each
as
it
arrived
was
like
the
angel
troubling
the
waters
of
bethesda
there
was
no
hope
for
the
old
or
timid
kew
was
an
expert
in
the
small
sciences
of
london
he
knew
not
only
how
to
mount
a
while
others
of
his
like
were
trying
four
abreast
to
do
the
same
but
also
how
to
stand
on
a
space
exactly
half
the
size
of
his
boot
soles
without
holding
on
this
is
done
as
you
probably
know
too
by
not
looking
out
of
the
window
kew
had
given
up
taxis
and
cigars
in
it
was
his
pretence
never
to
do
anything
on
principle
so
he
would
have
blushed
if
anybody
had
commented
on
this
ingenuous
economy
the
fact
that
he
had
joined
the
army
the
first
day
of
the
war
was
also
i
think
a
tender
spot
in
the
conscience
of
kew
a
victoria
cross
would
have
been
practically
unbearable
and
even
to
be
mentioned
in
despatches
would
have
been
a
most
upsetting
contradiction
of
that
commonplace
and
unprincipled
past
of
which
he
boasted
he
thought
he
was
such
a
simple
soul
that
he
had
no
motives
or
principles
in
anything
that
he
did
but
really
he
was
simpler
than
that
he
was
so
simple
that
he
did
his
best
without
thinking
about
it
it
certainly
sounds
rather
a
curious
way
to
live
in
the
twentieth
century
you
seven
standin
inside
said
the
gentleman
conductor
when
after
long
sojourn
in
upper
regions
he
came
down
to
his
basement
floor
five
standin
is
all
i
supposed
to
an
five
standin
is
all
i
allow
why
should
i
get
myself
into
trouble
for
five
standin
if
five
standin
is
all
i
allowed
to
in
spite
of
a
chorus
of
nervous
assent
from
all
his
flock
and
the
blushing
disappearance
of
the
two
superfluous
standers
the
continued
his
lament
in
this
strain
to
the
man
with
a
small
but
loud
grievance
sympathy
is
a
fatal
offering
the
had
a
round
red
nose
and
very
defective
teeth
kew
studied
him
in
a
new
light
for
this
was
jay
somehow
it
seemed
very
regrettable
i
wish
i
had
promised
not
to
tell
the
family
he
thought
he
and
jay
never
broke
their
promises
to
each
other
and
there
was
a
tacit
agreement
that
when
they
found
it
necessary
to
lie
to
each
other
they
always
gave
each
other
warning
where
the
rest
of
the
world
was
concerned
i
am
afraid
they
used
their
discretion
in
this
matter
it
ought
to
be
stopped
the
tactful
foot
of
family
authority
ought
to
step
on
it
he
presented
his
penny
angrily
to
the
i
expect
this
sort
of
man
asks
jay
to
walk
out
with
him
he
thought
and
with
a
cold
glance
took
the
ticket
offered
to
him
lucky
i
so
utterly
selfish
he
thought
or
i
should
be
devilish
worried
his
train
was
one
which
boasted
a
restaurant
car
and
kew
patronised
this
institution
but
when
he
was
in
the
middle
of
cold
meat
he
thought
she
is
probably
trying
to
live
on
a
week
continual
tripe
and
onions
so
he
refused
pudding
the
pudding
persistent
as
only
a
railway
pudding
can
be
came
back
incredulously
three
times
but
kew
pushed
it
away
if
i
could
get
anybody
outside
the
family
to
use
their
influence
i
should
be
within
the
letter
of
the
law
but
i
mostly
know
subalterns
and
nobody
below
a
brigadier
would
be
likely
to
have
much
influence
with
jay
she
probably
talk
down
even
a
it
seems
curious
that
he
should
deplore
the
fact
that
jay
had
turned
into
a
more
deeply
than
he
had
deplored
her
experiments
in
sweated
employment
i
think
that
a
uniformed
sister
or
wife
is
almost
unbearable
to
most
men
except
perhaps
one
in
the
nurse
uniform
of
which
even
paul
might
have
approved
the
gaiters
of
the
had
shaken
kew
to
his
foundations
the
thought
of
the
skirt
still
brought
his
heart
into
his
mouth
he
was
so
lacking
in
the
modern
mind
that
he
still
considered
himself
a
gentleman
no
socialist
speaking
between
clenched
teeth
in
a
strangled
voice
of
largely
groundless
protest
had
ever
gained
the
ear
of
kew
he
had
never
joined
a
society
of
any
sort
he
had
never
attended
a
public
meeting
since
he
gave
up
being
a
salvationist
at
the
age
of
ten
it
must
be
stopped
he
said
as
he
got
out
of
the
train
i
think
of
a
way
in
my
bath
this
was
always
the
moment
he
looked
forward
to
for
inspirations
anonyma
was
observable
as
he
walked
from
the
station
to
the
inn
craning
extravagantly
from
the
window
she
came
downstairs
and
met
him
at
the
door
such
a
disaster
she
said
and
handed
him
a
telegram
kew
stood
aghast
as
she
meant
him
to
no
disaster
is
ever
so
great
as
it
is
before
you
know
what
it
is
but
kew
ought
to
have
known
disasters
by
experience
russ
wife
has
appeared
why
should
she
be
introduced
as
a
disaster
asked
kew
with
a
sigh
of
relief
is
she
a
maniac
or
a
suffragette
or
a
mormon
or
just
some
one
who
has
never
read
any
of
your
books
he
opened
the
telegram
it
called
upon
him
to
rejoin
his
battalion
next
day
at
noon
russ
went
to
his
house
to
fetch
something
this
morning
and
found
his
wife
there
he
looks
quite
she
insisted
on
coming
here
with
him
and
now
she
wishes
to
go
on
the
tour
with
us
as
i
hear
the
car
is
hers
we
can
hardly
refuse
i
do
pretend
to
understand
the
subtleties
of
this
disaster
said
kew
but
as
you
evidently
do
intend
me
to
i
will
not
try
notice
however
that
i
am
keeping
my
head
i
have
always
wondered
how
i
should
behave
in
a
disaster
wait
till
you
meet
her
said
anonyma
kew
heard
russell
melodramatic
laughter
as
he
approached
the
door
and
he
trembled
she
laughed
in
a
concise
way
and
the
sound
was
constant
that
is
her
ready
sense
of
fun
that
you
can
hear
said
anonyma
bitterly
she
is
teaching
gustus
to
see
the
humorous
side
they
entered
to
find
poor
cousin
gustus
bending
like
a
reed
before
a
perfect
gale
of
russell
was
so
much
interested
in
what
she
was
saying
that
she
left
kew
on
her
leeward
side
for
the
moment
hardly
looking
at
him
as
she
shook
hands
it
enough
to
make
the
gods
laugh
on
olympus
she
said
but
it
did
not
make
cousin
gustus
laugh
noticing
this
russell
turned
to
kew
i
was
telling
your
cousin
about
my
pacificist
efforts
in
the
states
she
said
yes
i
can
see
your
eye
twinkling
i
know
a
pacifist
is
a
funny
thing
to
be
but
i
not
one
of
the
what
i
call
ones
i
do
it
all
joyously
i
was
telling
your
cousin
how
very
small
was
the
chance
that
robbed
us
of
success
in
ohio
what
sort
of
success
asked
kew
peace
said
russell
but
is
ohio
at
war
russell
laughed
heartily
her
unnecessarily
frank
laughter
showed
her
gums
as
well
as
her
teeth
and
made
one
wish
that
her
sense
of
humour
were
not
quite
so
keen
i
see
you
are
one
of
us
she
said
what
i
call
one
of
the
jolly
fraternity
no
ohio
is
still
enjoying
peace
but
if
you
follow
me
from
the
states
peace
will
come
there
we
must
fix
our
hopes
if
we
can
get
those
millions
of
brothers
and
sisters
of
ours
the
as
i
call
it
to
see
its
urgency
peace
must
come
for
brothers
and
sisters
they
are
you
know
patriotism
will
come
in
time
to
be
considered
a
vice
how
can
one
soul
if
you
take
my
meaning
be
affected
by
the
latitude
and
longitude
in
which
one
body
was
born
from
the
states
the
truth
shall
come
salvation
shall
dawn
in
the
west
listen
to
me
trying
to
be
poetic
it
makes
me
laugh
one
noticed
that
it
did
war
is
so
reasonless
as
to
be
funny
she
said
but
you
have
told
me
yet
about
the
little
chance
that
you
thought
would
tickle
olympus
said
kew
you
laughing
at
me
said
russell
but
i
do
mind
for
i
laugh
at
myself
i
like
you
shake
kew
immediately
thought
her
a
nice
woman
though
peculiar
russell
looked
in
and
saw
the
shake
in
progress
he
murmured
something
and
withdrew
hurriedly
for
a
moment
they
could
hear
his
agitated
voice
in
the
passage
reciting
milton
to
his
hound
do
listen
to
my
husband
never
silent
said
russell
did
you
ever
see
a
man
like
him
there
is
no
real
answer
to
this
sort
of
question
so
kew
said
yo
which
is
always
safe
then
he
added
do
tell
me
about
the
little
chance
this
was
the
little
chance
smiled
russell
we
ought
to
have
had
a
tremendously
successful
in
a
certain
town
in
ohio
we
had
every
reason
to
expect
three
thousand
people
and
we
thought
of
proposing
the
of
the
town
calling
it
peace
but
the
little
chance
was
a
printer
error
the
advertisement
gave
the
date
wrong
a
crowd
turned
up
at
the
empty
hall
and
two
days
later
when
we
arrived
they
were
so
tired
of
us
that
they
booed
our
demonstration
just
the
stupidity
of
an
inky
printer
between
us
and
success
do
you
mean
to
say
that
but
for
that
we
should
have
had
peace
by
now
asked
kew
in
a
reverent
voice
you
never
know
said
russell
that
meeting
might
have
been
the
match
to
light
the
flame
of
peace
all
over
the
world
it
bitterly
and
satirically
funny
is
it
what
fate
will
do
cousin
gustus
laughed
hysterically
in
chorus
and
then
said
that
his
head
ached
and
that
he
thought
he
would
go
to
bed
early
anonyma
led
him
away
please
do
make
peace
for
a
week
or
two
yet
begged
kew
let
me
see
what
i
can
do
first
i
am
going
how
foolish
of
you
said
russell
if
you
like
i
believe
i
have
enough
influence
to
get
you
to
america
instead
i
think
i
like
france
best
said
kew
i
do
feel
as
if
i
could
be
content
anywhere
short
of
france
just
now
surely
you
wo
be
content
anywhere
murdering
your
said
russell
you
wo
mind
my
incurable
flippancy
will
you
i
help
treating
things
lightly
not
at
all
replied
kew
but
i
am
often
content
in
the
intervals
of
murdering
my
i
play
the
penny
whistle
in
my
now
tell
me
said
russell
what
are
you
all
doing
here
what
mischief
are
you
leading
my
herbert
into
when
kew
had
recovered
from
a
foolish
astonishment
at
hearing
that
russell
was
known
to
others
as
herbert
he
said
we
looking
not
very
seriously
for
my
sister
who
seems
to
have
eloped
by
herself
to
the
west
coast
without
leaving
us
her
address
i
know
herbert
told
me
that
much
a
place
on
the
is
it
but
you
know
i
feel
a
certain
responsibility
for
herbert
i
have
neglected
him
so
long
i
can
not
bear
that
he
should
waste
his
time
in
what
i
call
these
stirring
days
you
must
think
because
i
treat
life
as
one
huge
joke
that
i
can
never
be
serious
one
can
wear
a
gay
mask
but
you
understand
me
do
you
you
are
one
of
us
there
was
a
pause
and
then
she
said
does
it
seem
funny
we
only
known
each
other
an
hour
and
here
we
are
intimate
kew
obediently
allowed
himself
for
a
moment
to
see
the
humorous
side
and
then
said
what
are
your
plans
then
yours
and
mr
russell
i
have
neglected
him
too
long
poor
old
thing
said
russell
i
must
stay
with
him
now
and
cheer
him
up
a
cheery
heart
can
bridge
any
gulf
do
you
think
you
know
i
was
just
what
i
call
a
jolly
girl
when
i
married
him
and
afterwards
i
forgot
to
grow
up
i
think
perhaps
my
treatment
of
him
has
been
rather
irresponsible
i
must
try
and
make
up
what
i
call
and
be
friends
like
two
jolly
little
kiddies
then
why
not
join
the
motor
tour
i
would
rather
take
herbert
back
to
our
little
nest
in
london
no
place
like
home
as
i
always
say
from
there
we
might
work
together
for
the
great
cause
of
peace
what
i
call
grail
she
had
crimped
hair
and
a
long
nose
the
tip
of
which
moved
when
she
spoke
you
would
never
have
given
her
credit
for
such
influence
as
she
claimed
in
the
world
affairs
only
her
homeric
laughter
and
a
pair
of
lorgnettes
reminded
you
of
her
greatness
when
kew
finally
disentangled
himself
from
the
company
of
this
jolly
creature
it
was
very
late
but
the
voice
of
anonyma
arrested
him
on
his
way
to
bed
her
face
with
a
plait
on
each
side
of
it
looked
at
him
cautiously
from
a
dark
doorway
kew
said
anonyma
i
wo
stand
it
we
must
be
rescued
nobody
can
remove
her
now
without
also
removing
russ
and
christina
said
kew
the
reconciliation
has
gone
too
far
then
russ
must
be
sacrificed
and
even
the
car
said
anonyma
firmly
gustus
and
i
can
hire
if
we
must
that
woman
must
be
removed
the
jealous
cat
kew
began
to
see
light
i
rescue
you
then
he
replied
i
think
of
a
way
in
my
bath
next
morning
a
great
noise
centring
in
the
bathroom
overflowed
through
the
inn
it
was
the
noise
of
kew
singing
joyful
extracts
from
do
you
remember
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
the
hall
of
the
mountain
king

goes

way
in
which
kew
rendered
this
passage
notoriously
a
difficult
one
for
a
solo
voice
would
have
conveyed
to
any
one
who
knew
him
that
he
had
solved
both
his
problems
anonyma
knocked
on
the
bathroom
door
and
said
cousin
gustus
headache
is
still
bad
kew
therefore
broke
into
anitra
dance
which
is
more
subdued
before
breakfast
he
and
russell
and
the
hound
walked
to
the
downs
the
motor
tour
seemed
to
have
come
to
a
standstill
cousin
headache
could
be
felt
all
over
the
house
the
moment
russell
and
kew
were
out
of
earshot
of
the
inn
kew
made
such
a
violent
resolve
to
speak
that
he
nearly
broke
a
tooth
russ
he
said
i
want
to
get
off
my
chest
for
your
benefit
something
that
has
been
worrying
me
awfully
russell
made
no
answer
he
had
got
out
of
the
habit
of
answering
it
about
jay
continued
kew
i
must
break
to
you
first
that
on
the
with
all
its
accessories
gulls
ghosts
turrets
aeroplanes
and
friends
is
one
large
and
elaborate
lie
she
and
i
are
very
much
alike
the
only
difference
between
us
used
to
be
her
skirt
and
now
she
has
gone
a
good
way
towards
discarding
that
she
is
nowhere
near
the
sea
she
is
in
london
now
you
russ
are
what
she
and
i
used
to
call
an
and
wiser
russell
jumped
violently
but
uttered
nothing
except
a
little
curse
to
his
dog
which
was
almost
under
his
and
you
are
about
the
only
person
i
could
trust
in
my
absence
to
get
jay
out
of
an
uncommonly
silly
position
i
ca
bear
her
present
pose
it
must
stop
at
once
and
if
i
had
time
i
would
stop
it
myself
i
have
unfortunately
sworn
not
to
give
her
away
to
the
family
so
i
come
to
you
she
is
a
russell
refrained
from
jumping
i
believe
he
had
expected
it
but
he
said
it
would
be
too
funny
kew
looked
at
him
nervously
fearing
for
a
moment
lest
sense
of
humour
had
proved
infectious
russell
was
thinking
how
funny
it
would
be
if
the
finger
of
desirable
coincidence
had
touched
his
life
how
funny
if
a
nice
piece
of
fiction
should
have
taken
upon
itself
to
make
of
him
its
hero
too
funny
to
be
true
but
you
i
hope
will
remember
that
the
coincidence
was
not
so
funny
as
he
thought
since
jay
had
beckoned
to
it
with
her
eyes
open
now
i
have
a
prejudice
against
said
kew
why
asked
russell
rather
indignantly
i
ca
explain
it
if
i
could
it
would
be
a
prejudice
it
would
be
an
opinion
but
well
just
think
the
trousered
probably
ask
her
to
walk
out
with
them
in
victoria
park
on
sundays
i
see
your
point
said
russell
you
are
about
double
as
old
as
she
is
if
i
may
say
so
and
you
are
not
one
of
the
family
two
great
advantages
you
know
jay
has
suffered
from
not
meeting
enough
older
and
wiser
people
she
has
had
to
worry
out
things
too
much
by
herself
she
has
never
been
talked
to
by
whom
she
could
respect
anonyma
never
talked
with
us
though
she
occasionally
a
good
talk
she
never
played
but
sometimes
suggested
a
good
game
it
different
somehow
you
older
and
wiser
without
being
too
old
or
too
wise
might
impress
jay
a
lot
i
think
because
you
do
say
overmuch
and
i
want
you
to
tell
her
something
of
what
i
feel
about
it
too
i
never
realised
before
that
from
your
point
of
view
there
was
any
advantage
in
being
older
and
wiser
said
russell
you
do
mind
my
saying
all
this
said
kew
it
was
an
assumption
rather
than
a
question
not
at
all
but
i
do
understand
exactly
what
you
want
me
to
do
to
give
up
this
idiotic
motor
tour
said
kew
and
go
back
to
london
and
talk
jay
out
of
her
i
want
her
to
leave
it
off
and
let
the
family
discover
her
romantically
enjoying
some
passable
imitation
of
her
secret
world
i
want
the
family
never
to
know
of
all
that
lay
between
i
do
want
it
all
to
come
right
i
going
off
and
i
may
not
see
her
again
and
i
know
hardly
any
trustable
person
but
you
right
said
russell
he
thought
it
too
funny
to
be
true
but
if
it
is
true
i
shall
be
surprised
kew
enlarged
to
him
on
the
details
of
his
mission
on
the
breakfast
table
when
they
returned
they
found
a
letter
from
jay
evidently
written
for
private
circulation
in
the
family
dear
kew
i
have
just
come
in
from
a
walk
almost
as
exciting
as
it
was
beautiful
we
walked
through
our
village
which
clings
to
both
sides
of
a
harbour
that
might
just
contain
a
carefully
navigated
the
village
is
grey
and
white
all
its
walls
are
whitewashed
all
its
roofs
are
slate
with
cushions
of
clinging
to
them
grow
outside
its
doors
seagulls
are
its
only
birds
the
slope
on
which
it
stands
is
so
steep
that
the
main
road
is
on
a
level
with
the
roofs
on
one
side
and
if
you
were
absentminded
you
might
walk
on
to
a
roof
and
fall
down
a
chimney
before
you
became
aware
that
you
had
strayed
from
the
street
but
we
were
not
we
sang
loud
songs
all
the
way
we
ran
across
the
grass
after
the
shadows
of
the
round
clouds
that
bowled
across
the
sky
in
single
file
we
followed
the
dog
trelawney
after
the
seagulls
everything
was
so
clear
that
we
could
see
the
little
rare
island
that
keeps
itself
to
itself
on
our
horizon
i
do
know
its
name
they
say
it
bears
a
town
and
a
and
a
parson
but
i
do
think
this
is
true
i
think
that
island
is
an
intermittent
dream
of
ours
when
you
get
beyond
the
village
the
cliff
leaves
off
indulging
in
coves
and
harbours
and
such
frivolities
and
decides
to
look
upon
itself
seriously
as
a
giant
wall
against
a
giant
sea
only
it
occasionally
defeats
its
own
object
because
it
stands
up
so
straight
that
the
sea
finds
it
easier
to
knock
down
on
a
point
of
cliff
there
was
a
lorelei
seagull
standing
with
its
eye
on
trelawney
it
had
pale
eyes
and
a
red
drop
on
its
beak
and
trelawney
being
a
did
what
the
seagull
meant
him
to
do
he
ran
for
it
he
ran
too
far
and
fell
over
the
edge
well
this
is
not
a
tragic
incident
only
an
exciting
one
trelawney
fell
on
to
a
ledge
about
ten
foot
below
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
sat
there
in
perfect
safety
shrieking
for
help
my
friend
said
this
is
a
case
of
my
teeth
and
go
it
is
a
saying
in
this
family
dating
from
the
spartan
childhood
of
my
friend
that
everything
is
possible
to
one
who
bites
his
teeth
and
goes
the
less
you
like
it
the
harder
you
bite
your
teeth
and
it
certainly
helps
my
friend
said
if
we
never
meet
again
remember
to
catch
and
hang
that
seagull
for
wilful
murder
it
would
look
rather
nice
stuffed
in
the
hall
the
cliff
overhangs
rather
just
there
and
when
he
got
over
the
edge
not
being
a
fly
or
used
to
walking
upside
down
he
missed
his
footing
we
heard
a
yelp
from
trelawney
but
the
seagull
conscience
is
still
free
of
murder
my
friend
only
fell
on
to
trelawney
ledge
so
it
was
all
right
and
we
ate
our
eggs
on
the
scene
of
the
incident
i
remember
said
russell
that
letter
said
anonyma
ought
to
help
us
a
bit
she
was
quite
bright
because
kew
had
conveyed
to
her
the
hope
that
the
plot
for
the
rescue
of
the
family
was
doing
well
cousin
gustus
also
with
no
traces
of
a
headache
except
a
faint
smell
of
had
come
down
hopefully
to
breakfast
obviously
the
north
coast
of
cornwall
said
russell
the
village
might
be
boscastle
and
the
island
is
surely
lundy
such
an
intensely
funny
name
lundy
is
it
for
some
reason
it
amuses
me
more
and
more
every
time
i
hear
it
it
reminds
me
of
learning
geography
with
the
taste
of
ink
and
bitten
pen
in
my
mouth
i
used
to
catch
my
eye
just
as
i
catching
yours
now
and
laugh
ever
so
much
over
lundy
i
used
to
be
a
terror
to
my
governesses
i
very
much
afraid
that
i
ca
spare
much
more
time
for
the
motor
tour
said
russell
and
anonyma
was
so
anxious
for
the
first
signs
of
rescue
that
she
actually
let
him
speak
business
in
london
i
dare
say
i
could
get
you
to
cornwall
within
the
next
few
days
but
some
time
this
week
i
must
get
back
to
town
i
come
with
you
said
his
wife
you
ca
shake
me
off
so
easily
my
dear
it
too
rainy
to
start
said
cousin
gustus
i
have
known
people
drowned
by
swollen
rivers
and
such
while
trying
to
travel
in
just
such
a
deluge
as
this
we
will
start
wet
or
fine
added
anonyma
the
fact
remains
said
kew
that
i
must
leave
you
by
the
ten
something
i
must
leave
you
to
sniff
without
my
help
like
bloodhounds
along
the
trail
of
the
elusive
jay
but
i
wo
bid
any
one
a
fervent
because
i
daresay
i
shall
be
back
again
on
leave
for
lack
of
anything
else
to
do
in
three
weeks
time
if
we
ca
get
across
the
channel
in
that
case
i
meet
you
one
day
next
month
say
at
land
end
or
the
firth
of
forth
otherwise
say
forty
years
hence
in
heaven
it
is
very
wrong
to
joke
about
death
said
cousin
gustus
i
once
knew
a
man
who
died
with
just
such
a
joke
on
his
lips
i
hope
it
was
a
better
joke
than
that
said
kew
it
ca
be
wrong
to
laugh
at
death
death
is
such
a
silly
cynical
thing
that
a
little
wholesome
by
an
impartial
observer
ought
to
do
it
good
russell
was
heard
asking
his
hound
in
a
low
voice
for
the
truth
about
death
and
immortality
so
kew
went
away
and
left
the
family
gazing
at
the
rain
russell
was
conducting
a
mysterious
process
known
as
writing
up
notes
it
was
hardly
possible
by
the
way
that
anonyma
could
have
loved
the
possessor
of
a
rival
notebook
it
rained
very
earnestly
there
was
no
hole
in
the
sky
for
hope
to
look
through
the
puddles
in
the
village
street
jumped
into
the
air
with
the
force
of
the
rain
you
will
without
difficulty
remember
that
it
rained
several
times
in
the
spring
of
but
this
day
was
a
most
perfect
example
of
its
kind
cousin
gustus
was
both
depressed
and
depressing
i
am
afraid
i
have
not
given
you
a
very
flattering
portrait
of
cousin
gustus
i
ought
to
have
told
you
that
he
was
very
well
provided
with
human
affections
and
that
he
loved
kew
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
i
might
say
that
the
departure
of
kew
let
loose
cousin
gustus
intense
grievance
against
the
germans
except
that
i
could
hardly
describe
a
grievance
as
let
loose
that
had
never
been
pent
up
cousin
gustus
was
always
angry
with
the
germans
whatever
they
did
but
the
thing
that
made
him
more
angry
than
ever
was
to
read
in
his
paper
some
report
admitting
courageous
or
gracious
behaviour
in
a
german
the
partings
and
the
troubles
that
these
germans
have
caused
ought
to
hang
like
round
their
necks
for
ever
said
cousin
gustus
talk
about
iron
crosses
pish
i
should
like
to
have
a
german
here
for
ten
minutes
i
should
say
to
him
kew
was
a
good
boy
i
would
almost
say
a
clever
boy
doing
well
in
his
profession
no
more
thought
than
that
dog
has
of
being
a
soldier
till
war
broke
out
does
that
look
as
if
we
were
prepared
for
war
i
should
say
that
show
where
the
blame
lies
what
could
he
answer
russell
and
his
hound
were
apparently
listening
but
they
could
offer
no
suggestions
kew
going
has
upset
me
so
that
my
headache
has
returned
and
i
can
not
get
any
aspirin
here
continued
cousin
gustus
i
know
a
man
who
was
very
much
addicted
to
these
neuralgic
headaches
who
committed
suicide
by
throwing
himself
from
the
bathroom
window
solely
owing
to
neuralgia
and
the
rain
does
nothing
towards
improving
matters
they
say
the
german
guns
bring
on
the
rain
i
tell
you
there
is
no
limit
to
their
guilt
look
at
this
morning
paper
enemy
bombarded
this
section
of
our
front
with
increasing
intensity
during
the
day
i
ask
you
is
that
war
yes
said
russell
absently
nonsense
said
cousin
gustus
what
we
ought
to
do
is
to
shoot
every
german
we
can
catch
shooting
too
good
for
them
hang
them
that
would
teach
them
any
government
but
ours
would
have
thought
of
it
long
ago
iron
crosses
indeed
pish
cousin
gustus
finds
the
iron
cross
very
useful
for
the
filling
up
of
crannies
in
his
edifice
of
wrath
anonyma
said
when
i
think
of
those
old
german
songs
i
feel
as
if
i
had
lost
a
bit
of
my
heart
and
shall
never
find
it
again
that
is
what
i
regret
most
about
this
war
it
is
bad
art
art
indeed
said
cousin
gustus
why
every
time
they
steal
a
picture
they
get
an
iron
cross
i
know
a
man
who
saw
a
german
wearing
a
perfect
rosary
of
iron
crosses
the
fellow
was
boasting
of
having
bayoneted
more
babies
than
any
other
man
in
the
regiment
listen
to
this
enemy
attacked
the
outskirts
of
the
village
of
what
and
engaged
our
troops
in
fighting
think
of
it
and
we
used
to
say
they
were
a
civilised
race
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
it
says
it
atrocious
enemy
were
finally
repulsed
at
the
point
of
the
bay
oh
well
of
course
that
may
be
different
i
do
pretend
to
be
a
military
expert
i
hate
the
germans
said
anonyma
because
they
have
spoilt
my
own
idea
of
them
i
hate
having
a
mistake
brought
home
to
me
i
hate
the
germans
began
russell
because
i
going
for
a
walk
said
anonyma
i
am
sick
of
sitting
here
and
hearing
you
two
old
fogies
argue
about
the
war
if
war
is
bad
art
it
is
vulgar
to
refer
to
it
i
know
exactly
what
russell
was
going
to
say
he
had
a
vague
culinary
metaphor
in
his
mind
i
hate
the
germans
because
they
are
underdone
they
are
red
meat
their
vices
and
their
virtues
and
their
music
and
their
greed
and
their
fairyism
and
their
militarism
all
seem
to
have
been
roasted
in
a
hurry
and
to
contain
like
red
meat
the
natural
juices
to
an
extent
that
seems
to
us
excessive
the
reason
why
some
of
us
dislike
red
meat
is
that
it
reminds
us
too
much
of
what
our
food
originally
was
as
we
ourselves
possibly
are
rather
overcooked
by
the
fire
of
civilisation
this
vulgar
deficiency
in
our
enemy
is
very
apparent
to
us
this
is
an
elaborate
but
not
a
pleasing
analogy
and
it
was
fortunate
that
russell
was
interrupted
otherwise
i
think
he
might
have
been
trying
to
this
day
to
explain
it
to
an
exasperated
cousin
gustus
he
spoke
of
it
to
his
hound
and
the
idea
interested
that
animal
very
much
russell
unfortunately
had
a
cold
and
was
therefore
unable
on
such
a
wet
day
to
leave
the
house
or
cousin
gustus
but
anonyma
went
out
in
a
mackintosh
that
gave
her
the
silhouette
of
a
cossack
and
a
beautiful
little
tarpaulin
and
high
boots
and
a
skirt
short
enough
to
give
the
boots
every
chance
of
advertisement
the
notebook
was
safe
in
a
pocket
she
covered
with
great
speed
and
enthusiasm
the
few
miles
to
the
sea
she
reached
it
at
a
point
where
the
cliff
dwindled
into
flatness
where
the
gentle
tide
rattled
on
pebbles
instead
of
on
sand
where
the
tall
breakwaters
contradicted
the
line
of
the
shore
the
furthest
breakwater
had
seaweed
like
hair
waving
on
the
water
at
intervals
it
would
seem
to
be
thrust
up
between
two
glassy
waves
like
a
victim
beckoning
for
deliverance
from
the
grip
of
some
monster
and
then
the
sea
lips
would
close
on
it
again
the
sea
was
freckled
by
the
rain
the
waves
were
beaten
into
submission
the
tide
was
rather
low
and
not
very
far
away
a
great
company
of
porpoises
bowed
each
other
through
the
mazes
of
a
slow
quadrille
there
were
a
few
rocks
spotted
like
leopards
and
on
one
of
these
a
young
brown
seagull
rested
and
allowed
itself
occasionally
to
be
washed
gracefully
away
lazy
nature
said
anonyma
reprovingly
to
sketch
such
a
scheme
in
a
few
careless
lines
for
the
whole
world
was
there
was
no
horizon
to
the
sea
the
downs
were
blotted
out
the
wet
shingle
reflected
its
surroundings
the
waves
broke
unmarked
by
foam
or
shadow
there
was
nothing
but
the
porpoises
and
the
breakwaters
and
the
rocks
and
a
little
bald
sand
dune
sketched
on
the
canvas
of
that
pale
day
anonyma
perpetuated
in
her
notebook
her
opinion
of
nature
as
an
artist
on
the
whole
it
was
a
flattering
opinion
then
she
sat
on
the
breakwater
and
thought
how
fortunate
she
was
to
be
able
to
think
such
interesting
thoughts
about
what
she
saw
how
fortunate
to
enjoy
thought
and
to
cause
thought
how
fortunate
to
feel
oneself
a
member
of
the
comforting
fellowship
of
intelligence
it
is
much
more
delightful
anonyma
informed
the
sea
to
be
intelligent
than
to
be
beautiful
why
do
we
all
try
to
make
our
outsides
beautiful
there
is
competition
in
beauty
but
there
is
brotherhood
in
intelligence
to
be
clever
is
to
share
a
secret
and
a
smile
with
all
clever
people
a
vision
of
the
coast
of
the
united
kingdom
encircled
by
a
ring
of
consciously
clever
anonymas
sitting
on
breakwaters
sharing
each
with
all
a
secret
and
a
smile
came
vaguely
to
her
she
put
all
that
she
could
of
her
soliloquy
into
her
notebook
and
then
she
noticed
the
face
of
a
man
with
its
eyes
upon
her
appearing
stealthily
over
a
breakwater
the
face
wore
the
grin
that
some
people
wear
when
they
are
doing
anything
with
great
caution
this
gave
it
a
very
empty
bright
expression
like
the
mask
that
represents
comedy
in
a
theatre
decoration
the
face
dropped
down
behind
the
breakwater
after
meeting
anonyma
surprised
eye
for
a
second
or
two
anonyma
kept
her
head
first
she
thought
it
was
the
face
of
a
bather
the
path
to
whose
clothes
she
was
unwittingly
barring
then
she
thought
it
was
the
face
of
a
picnicker
resentful
of
her
intrusion
then
she
thought
it
was
the
face
of
a
german
spy
the
first
two
of
these
three
thoughts
she
rejected
because
the
weather
reduced
their
possibility
to
a
minimum
the
third
she
instinctively
adopted
as
a
certainty
the
face
at
once
became
obviously
german
in
her
eyes
it
was
broader
about
the
chin
than
about
the
forehead
it
was
pink
the
architecture
of
the
nose
was
painfully
she
scanned
the
sea
for
the
periscope
of
a
submarine
anonyma
remembered
that
she
had
written
in
her
notebook
a
day
or
two
before
an
intimate
description
of
the
coast
as
seen
from
the
ring
she
also
remembered
distinctly
seeing
in
the
bar
of
the
inn
a
notice
warning
her
to
the
effect
that
walls
and
probably
breakwaters
have
ears
and
eyes
in
these
days
and
that
the
german
government
has
a
persistent
wish
to
possess
itself
of
private
diaries
and
notebooks
i
am
having
an
adventure
said
gustus
i
must
keep
cool
she
got
up
from
her
breakwater
holding
her
notebook
very
tightly
and
began
to
walk
away
when
she
looked
back
she
saw
the
top
of
the
head
moving
behind
the
breakwater
in
a
parallel
direction
to
her
own
course
when
he
reached
the
point
where
the
breakwater
ended
and
denied
him
cover
he
wavered
for
a
moment
and
then
with
an
expression
of
elaborate
indifference
followed
her
i
must
keep
even
cooler
than
this
thought
anonyma
i
must
try
and
catch
the
spy
she
walked
across
some
waste
land
sown
with
memories
of
picnics
and
reached
the
main
road
the
man
crossed
the
waste
land
behind
her
he
tried
in
a
futile
way
to
look
as
if
he
were
not
doing
so
on
the
main
road
anonyma
turned
and
waited
for
him
it
seemed
useless
in
that
empty
landscape
to
sustain
the
pretence
that
they
were
unaware
of
each
other
did
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
she
asked
as
well
as
she
could
for
the
great
lump
of
excitement
that
beat
in
her
throat
before
her
eyes
visions
of
headlines
danced
lady
novelist
plucky
capture
of
a
spy
the
man
became
dark
red
as
she
spoke
yes
he
said
i
wanted
to
ask
you
what
you
were
writing
in
that
notebook
anonyma
paused
for
a
moment
as
she
decided
what
she
ought
to
do
then
she
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
i
have
detailed
military
information
about
this
coast
for
twenty
miles
round
in
my
notebook
with
accurate
reports
as
to
the
depth
of
the
water
if
you
come
to
my
lodgings
in
d
i
can
show
you
a
map
that
i
have
made
a
tremor
ran
through
the
stranger
a
map
he
repeated
yes
a
map
said
anonyma
and
then
as
he
did
not
move
she
added
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
also
a
design
for
a
new
kind
of
bomb
which
i
bought
from
a
man
in
london
a
bomb
he
said
anonyma
thought
that
he
was
evidently
a
foreigner
though
his
accent
was
english
he
seemed
to
find
english
rather
difficult
to
understand
why
do
you
tell
me
all
this
he
asked
finally
because
i
recognise
your
face
as
that
of
a
sp
i
mean
a
in
the
great
brotherhood
of
espionage
said
anonyma
come
on
then
said
the
man
so
they
walked
off
together
why
did
you
take
up
this
calling
asked
the
man
presently
are
you
a
german
well
more
or
less
said
anonyma
at
least
i
have
never
been
a
christian
i
believe
that
one
must
take
either
war
or
christianity
seriously
hardly
both
it
was
a
good
opportunity
for
a
monologue
obviously
the
stranger
was
not
one
who
would
resent
a
monopoly
of
the
conversation
after
all
men
are
only
minor
gods
said
anonyma
and
war
is
what
gods
were
born
for
germany
knows
that
that
why
under
the
present
circumstances
i
rather
take
german
money
than
english
are
we
anywhere
near
d
yet
anonyma
hoped
that
he
still
had
no
suspicions
his
voice
was
distinctly
nervous
to
reassure
him
she
said
why
did
you
take
up
espionage
yourself
why
indeed
said
the
stranger
in
an
ardent
voice
of
course
the
pay
was
enormous
twenty
thousand
francs
if
i
could
get
an
exact
chart
of
the
south
coast
why
francs
asked
anonyma
not
francs
i
find
these
various
currencies
so
confusing
do
you
of
course
i
mean
pfennigs
twenty
thousand
pfennigs
said
anonyma
look
here
are
you
trying
to
be
funny
far
from
it
said
the
man
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
awfully
nervous
of
me
yes
no
i
mean
of
discovery
you
do
seem
to
be
absolutely
cut
out
for
your
job
said
anonyma
they
walked
in
silence
for
a
while
anonyma
sought
through
her
mind
to
find
something
she
could
say
in
keeping
with
her
part
she
decided
finally
on
a
rather
ambiguous
though
imposing
attitude
the
germans
have
discovered
the
truth
that
anything
good
is
belligerent
love
included
you
ca
fight
properly
with
any
weapon
but
your
life
death
is
not
the
only
thing
that
passes
by
the
he
remains
alive
but
he
also
remains
ignorant
all
are
really
women
in
disguise
and
all
women
are
utterly
superfluous
we
only
know
men
people
who
disapprove
of
war
shall
have
no
part
in
peace
the
peace
shall
be
ours
who
suffered
for
it
and
only
we
have
earned
it
the
only
decent
thing
left
for
the
americans
and
quakers
to
do
now
is
to
hold
their
tongues
when
peace
comes
they
have
earned
the
right
to
rejoice
i
am
a
quaker
said
the
stranger
i
did
know
the
germans
allowed
quakers
at
large
i
am
not
a
german
said
the
stranger
then
what
has
happened
asked
anonyma
standing
suddenly
still
at
the
top
of
the
main
street
of
d
why
did
you
want
my
notebook
because
i
could
plainly
see
you
taking
notes
in
it
you
thought
me
a
spy
you
do
leave
me
much
room
for
doubt
they
guided
each
other
to
the
gate
of
the
there
they
stopped
again
this
is
where
i
was
bringing
you
said
anonyma
as
their
eyes
fell
simultaneously
on
the
label
over
the
door
sussex
county
police
it
seems
to
me
that
honours
are
easy
she
added
after
a
pause
you
see
what
has
happened
the
stranger
thought
for
a
moment
with
a
look
of
dawning
relief
on
his
pink
face
but
you
could
have
made
up
all
those
dreadful
opinions
he
said
i
did
said
anonyma
i
meant
them
all
as
applied
to
england
do
you
think
we
better
take
each
other
in
to
make
sure
suggested
her
companion
the
inspector
quite
a
good
sort
i
know
him
well
you
may
read
my
notebook
if
you
like
to
make
quite
sure
said
anonyma
i
almost
sure
the
inspector
would
have
either
too
much
or
too
little
sense
of
humour
for
the
situation
she
was
conscious
of
a
certain
disappointment
her
adventure
had
fallen
flat
she
felt
no
pleasure
in
the
idea
of
painting
a
vivid
for
the
people
at
home
even
her
notebook
must
never
hear
of
this
morning
work
how
foolish
of
you
she
said
irritably
do
i
look
like
a
spy
do
i
she
felt
impelled
to
be
angry
with
him
and
seized
upon
another
pretext
you
are
a
conscientious
objector
i
suppose
and
what
business
has
a
conscientious
objector
to
be
do
i
understand
that
you
will
only
help
your
country
when
you
can
do
it
vicariously
through
the
police
with
no
risk
to
yourself
it
is
very
dignified
a
spy
is
outside
every
pale
said
the
stranger
my
conscience
objects
to
the
shedding
of
blood
yet
it
is
an
english
conscience
all
the
same
english
said
anonyma
if
you
wo
die
for
england
england
yours
to
love
you
shall
not
have
that
honour
if
dying
for
england
is
the
test
of
a
patriot
said
the
pink
quaker
what
about
you
i
would
die
for
england
i
work
for
england
said
anonyma
four
hours
a
week
she
went
on
i
have
told
you
already
that
women
in
either
sex
are
superfluous
but
after
all
real
women
were
born
to
their
burden
women
were
born
to
put
up
with
second
bests
and
also
posterity
is
mostly
a
woman
job
but
you
were
born
a
man
with
a
great
heritage
of
honour
you
have
kicked
that
honour
away
you
have
sold
your
birthright
the
quaker
was
the
sort
of
man
in
whose
face
and
mind
one
could
see
exactly
what
his
mother
was
like
some
men
are
like
that
and
others
one
would
say
could
never
have
been
so
intimate
with
a
woman
as
to
be
born
of
her
my
soul
is
greater
than
i
am
said
the
stranger
there
is
no
command
that
drowns
the
command
of
the
soul
i
can
not
possibly
be
wrong
you
could
not
possibly
be
right
said
anonyma
anonyma
on
her
return
to
the
inn
was
very
generous
with
dealing
with
nature
her
family
during
supper
was
not
left
in
ignorance
as
to
the
peace
and
meaning
of
the
sea
and
the
parallel
between
waves
and
generations
and
the
miracles
of
the
mist
and
the
tranquil
musing
of
the
beaches
and
the
unseen
imminence
of
the
downs
it
would
make
a
wonderful
background
to
a
short
story
said
anonyma
and
then
she
stopped
rather
abruptly
her
silence
after
that
might
have
struck
the
family
as
strange
had
it
not
coincided
with
the
arrival
of
the
evening
paper
which
turned
the
listeners
thoughts
to
less
beautiful
matters
air
raid
said
cousin
gustus
i
prophesied
quite
a
long
time
ago
that
we
should
have
another
raid
but
nobody
ever
listens
to
what
i
say
two
horses
killed
somewhere
in
the
eastern
counties
i
thought
somewhere
was
a
town
in
france
said
russell
was
london
attacked
asked
russell
i
rather
anxious
about
paul
anonyma
rose
to
the
surface
again
i
had
such
a
wonderful
talk
with
a
once
about
his
experiences
during
a
raid
such
an
intelligent
man
i
dearly
love
conductors
such
an
interesting
and
vivacious
class
i
should
feel
it
an
honour
to
be
intimate
with
one
he
told
me
in
the
most
vivid
terms
how
a
bomb
fell
in
the
street
in
front
of
his
blowing
the
preceding
to
atoms
he
told
me
how
his
driver
turned
the
in
what
he
called
spice
of
a
crown
and
plunged
into
a
side
street
he
said
that
he
could
see
the
zeppelin
balanced
on
its
searchlights
like
sausage
on
stilts
and
when
it
was
directly
above
them
the
top
of
his
was
suddenly
cleared
of
people
as
if
by
magic
except
for
one
man
who
put
up
an
umbrella
and
tight
i
pitied
the
conductor
it
must
have
been
a
terrible
experience
his
eyes
were
starting
from
his
head
bulging
like
a
rabbit
he
said
he
had
a
wife
and
baby
up
leyton
way
and
that
he
was
so
worried
about
them
that
he
frequently
called
out
his
list
of
destinations
the
wrong
way
round
look
here
said
russell
i
think
i
better
go
up
and
see
about
nonsense
said
his
wife
i
refuse
to
go
to
london
until
the
moon
is
there
to
protect
me
as
it
were
so
comic
to
look
upon
a
heavenly
body
as
a
practical
protection
i
will
not
allow
you
to
run
needlessly
into
danger
only
this
morning
you
were
making
plans
to
go
to
cornwall
naughty
boy
no
but
darling
i
insist
said
russell
cornwall
it
is
for
the
present
if
you
say
another
word
i
shall
smack
you
and
put
you
in
the
corner
cornwall
it
was
the
family
drew
near
to
its
destination
on
a
misty
day
the
sun
shone
not
at
all
but
occasionally
showed
its
bare
pale
outline
through
a
veil
of
cloud
the
road
in
front
of
christina
was
so
dim
that
russell
could
people
it
for
himself
with
imaginations
now
a
knight
in
armour
stood
at
the
next
corner
now
a
phantom
sea
gleamed
over
the
curve
of
the
road
now
he
saw
great
slim
ghosts
beckoning
him
on
there
were
real
sheep
every
few
hundred
yards
for
a
sheep
fair
was
taking
place
somewhere
near
by
the
sheep
came
out
of
the
mist
like
armies
of
giants
and
shrank
as
they
grew
clearer
the
roads
were
rippled
with
the
footprints
of
many
sheep
even
when
there
were
no
sheep
in
sight
the
mist
filled
their
places
with
ghostly
flocks
each
sheep
as
it
passed
examined
the
wheels
of
christina
as
long
as
the
dogs
allowed
it
to
do
so
each
flock
was
followed
by
two
men
and
sometimes
a
child
in
clothes
on
a
pony
and
sometimes
a
woman
with
a
shawl
over
her
head
anonyma
notebook
became
very
restless
and
finally
russell
was
obliged
to
drive
the
family
to
the
point
whither
the
sheep
were
bound
so
they
went
to
the
little
town
through
which
the
excitement
of
the
fair
thrilled
like
the
blast
from
a
trumpet
bewildered
sheep
looked
in
at
its
shop
windows
farmers
in
shouted
affectionate
remarks
to
each
other
across
its
village
green
and
introduced
dear
friends
at
a
great
distance
to
other
dear
friends
with
much
formality
dogs
argued
in
a
professional
way
about
the
merits
of
their
sheep
russell
hound
who
had
never
before
heard
the
suggestion
that
dogs
were
intended
for
any
purpose
but
ornament
looked
on
breathless
with
surprise
his
morals
were
affected
for
life
by
the
revolutionary
sight
of
a
dog
biting
the
tail
of
a
disobedient
sheep
i
try
it
in
kensington
gardens
thought
russell
hound
as
he
looked
nervously
at
his
master
christina
the
found
her
way
to
the
centre
of
this
activity
there
the
sheep
bleated
in
tight
confinement
and
to
each
pen
was
attached
the
appropriate
dog
looking
very
dogs
who
had
come
from
great
distances
to
buy
sheep
were
anxiously
sniffing
up
the
smell
of
their
purchases
so
that
no
mistake
might
be
made
on
the
way
home
over
the
line
of
pens
a
viaduct
ran
and
it
was
bent
continually
by
the
weight
of
large
shepherds
balancing
their
way
along
to
take
a
view
of
possible
bargains
a
facetious
auctioneer
with
the
village
policeman
arm
round
his
neck
was
sitting
on
the
wall
at
the
end
of
the
field
addressing
everybody
very
frequently
as
gentlemen
sheep
arrived
and
sheep
departed
constantly
is
it
terribly
slavish
somehow
said
anonyma
the
sheep
never
being
consulted
at
all
bought
and
sold
and
smelt
and
spat
upon
as
if
they
had
no
heart
beating
beneath
that
wool
no
as
jay
used
to
say
russell
heard
and
remembered
there
were
few
doubts
left
in
him
as
to
the
truth
of
his
miracle
he
had
a
little
tune
the
scaffolding
of
a
poem
in
his
head
and
to
the
sound
of
it
he
lived
that
day
although
i
do
expect
he
ever
got
the
poem
into
words
if
you
start
your
idea
along
an
uncertain
course
you
have
to
stop
and
start
afresh
to
get
it
straight
you
can
never
finish
it
when
once
it
has
a
crooked
swing
i
gather
that
motor
cyclists
occasionally
have
much
the
same
experience
with
their
machines
but
russell
with
a
mind
steering
a
tangled
course
asked
for
nothing
better
he
was
very
nearly
sure
of
romance
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
i
hope
that
the
feeling
of
making
poetry
is
not
confined
to
the
people
who
write
it
down
there
is
no
luxury
like
it
and
i
hope
we
all
share
it
i
think
perhaps
the
same
thrill
that
goes
through
russell
and
me
when
the
ghost
of
a
completed
thing
begins
to
be
seen
also
delights
the
khaki
coster
who
writes
his
first
and
very
likely
last
from
france
and
the
little
old
country
mother
who
lies
awake
composing
the
in
memoriam
of
her
son
for
a
local
paper
and
the
burglar
down
who
takes
off
his
cap
as
a
child
funeral
goes
by
the
feeling
is
this
is
a
thing
out
of
my
heart
that
i
am
showing
this
is
my
best
confession
and
nobody
knew
there
was
this
within
me
i
am
sure
that
that
great
glory
of
poetry
in
one
heart
does
not
wait
on
achievement
if
it
did
what
centuries
would
die
unglorified
it
is
just
perfection
appearing
to
your
equal
pride
and
shame
a
perfection
that
never
taunts
you
with
your
limitations
russell
and
christina
knew
well
their
road
through
the
mist
that
afternoon
there
was
no
difficulty
in
the
world
and
no
need
to
see
or
to
think
the
all
spoke
the
names
of
fated
places
it
was
useless
for
anonyma
to
study
the
map
she
found
no
mention
there
of
the
enchanted
way
on
which
their
course
was
set
we
will
not
go
through
launceston
said
anonyma
there
must
be
a
quicker
way
to
the
sea
than
that
russell
cared
not
for
her
and
cared
not
for
launceston
the
spell
was
cast
upon
christina
wheels
there
was
no
escaping
the
appointed
way
launceston
reached
out
its
net
and
caught
them
almost
as
far
as
the
post
office
anonyma
was
protesting
we
will
not
go
through
launceston
launceston
was
determined
to
get
us
laughed
russell
is
it
humorous
the
way
things
happen
the
sun
was
setting
as
they
first
saw
the
cornish
sea
the
sky
was
swept
suddenly
clear
of
mist
the
seagulls
against
the
sky
were
like
little
crucified
angels
the
road
ran
to
the
shore
the
sun
had
little
delicate
clouds
across
its
face
like
the
islands
in
a
japanese
painting
the
wet
rocks
that
lay
in
the
sun
path
were
plated
with
gold
and
the
tall
waves
with
shadowed
faces
made
of
that
path
a
ladder
the
fields
of
foam
on
the
sea
looked
very
blue
in
the
pale
light
the
sun
was
like
an
angel
with
a
flaming
sword
the
angel
dipped
his
feet
into
the
sea
the
sun
was
like
a
flaming
stage
for
the
comedies
of
gods
a
ship
passed
dramatically
across
it
one
dazzled
eyes
saw
great
phantom
ships
all
over
the
sea
the
sun
was
like
a
monster
with
horns
of
fire
that
pierced
one
two
eyes
and
gradually
it
sank
the
sun
was
like
a
word
written
between
the
sea
and
the
sky
a
word
that
was
swallowed
up
by
the
sea
before
any
man
had
time
to
read
it
there
was
suddenly
no
sun
the
little
forsaken
clouds
were
like
flames
for
a
moment
and
then
they
were
blown
out
russell
waved
his
right
hand
towards
great
cliffs
like
the
towers
of
kings
behind
the
village
this
is
the
place
he
said
if
i
have
dared
to
surrender
some
imitation
of
splendour
something
i
knew
that
was
tender
something
i
loved
that
was
brave
if
in
my
singing
i
shewed
songs
that
i
heard
on
my
road
were
they
not
debts
that
i
owed
rather
than
gifts
that
i
gave
if
certain
hours
on
their
climb
up
the
long
ladder
of
time
turned
my
confusion
to
rhyme
drove
me
to
dare
an
attempt
if
by
fair
chance
i
might
seem
sometimes
abreast
of
my
theme
was
i
translating
a
dream
was
it
a
dream
that
you
dreamt
high
and
miraculous
skies
bless
and
astonish
my
eyes
all
my
dead
secrets
arise
all
my
dead
stories
come
true
here
is
the
gate
to
the
sea
once
you
unlocked
it
for
me
now
since
you
gave
me
the
key
shall
i
unlock
it
for
you
man
ought
to
feel
humble
when
he
reflects
upon
the
fact
that
he
can
survive
and
even
thrive
on
any
distress
except
distress
of
the
body
god
can
wither
his
soul
and
still
he
lives
grief
can
swallow
his
heart
and
still
he
lives
but
his
stomach
can
kill
him
all
is
apparently
over
between
me
and
peace
thought
jay
but
there
must
be
something
to
take
the
place
of
peace
there
is
only
one
thing
that
can
adequately
usurp
the
place
of
peace
but
its
name
did
not
occur
to
jay
she
did
not
know
what
had
happened
to
her
she
felt
constantly
a
little
mad
irresponsible
wants
clamoured
in
her
breast
from
morning
till
night
and
all
night
the
company
of
her
secret
friend
was
more
glorious
than
ever
she
ran
to
her
world
as
you
perhaps
run
to
church
yet
even
there
she
felt
expectant
when
a
tall
tough
thundercloud
bends
across
the
sky
i
watch
for
the
first
flash
and
listen
for
the
first
roar
and
in
my
heart
stillness
seems
impossible
and
at
the
same
time
imperative
so
jay
waited
feeling
all
the
time
that
she
could
not
wait
another
minute
you
shall
not
hear
whence
comes
my
fear
you
shall
not
know
the
name
of
it
but
out
of
strife
it
came
to
life
and
only
striving
came
of
it
though
for
its
sake
my
heart
may
break
yet
worse
would
i
endure
for
it
this
thing
shall
be
a
god
to
me
i
will
not
seek
a
cure
for
it
she
thought
a
good
deal
about
russell
i
am
sure
that
he
would
have
laughed
painfully
could
he
have
seen
the
picture
of
himself
that
remained
with
the
the
picture
made
him
thinner
and
his
eyes
more
intelligent
and
the
line
of
his
mouth
happier
but
it
did
not
make
him
look
younger
because
jay
liked
him
to
be
older
and
wiser
he
never
came
into
the
secret
world
several
times
she
tried
to
drag
him
thither
but
always
at
the
critical
moment
he
got
left
outside
yet
i
can
not
say
that
in
her
secret
world
she
missed
him
the
point
of
the
bubble
enchantment
is
that
there
is
nothing
lacking
in
it
is
a
profession
that
does
not
engross
the
mind
unduly
the
eye
and
the
ear
and
the
hand
work
by
themselves
charing
cross
whispered
in
a
conductor
ear
at
the
bank
produces
a
white
ticket
from
her
hand
without
any
calculation
on
her
part
she
becomes
a
machine
with
her
human
brain
free
for
other
matters
she
grows
a
great
hatred
for
all
fares
above
fourpence
because
they
need
special
thought
jay
filled
her
day
with
unsatisfactory
thinking
she
found
to
her
surprise
that
one
may
love
life
and
yet
also
think
lovingly
of
death
to
live
is
most
interesting
in
an
uneasy
way
but
to
die
is
to
forget
at
once
all
these
trivial
turbulences
to
forget
equally
the
people
you
have
loved
and
the
people
you
have
hated
to
forget
everything
you
ever
knew
to
be
alone
and
to
be
no
longer
disturbed
by
unceasing
voices
at
this
time
i
think
jay
felt
more
hatred
of
everybody
than
love
of
any
one
person
but
then
of
course
she
had
vowed
to
chloris
after
the
affair
with
young
william
morgan
that
she
would
never
fall
in
love
again
she
said
i
have
been
through
love
it
is
not
a
sea
as
people
say
it
is
only
a
river
and
i
have
waded
through
it
yet
there
is
certainly
something
very
remarkable
about
that
man
she
thought
i
do
believe
i
like
him
much
i
do
want
to
know
him
better
though
i
should
like
him
to
know
me
i
believe
he
is
my
real
next
of
kin
i
believe
he
has
a
secret
world
too
she
was
on
her
last
homeward
journey
and
it
was
one
of
her
early
days
the
hours
of
a
conductor
move
up
and
down
the
day
sometimes
jay
punctured
her
first
ticket
at
a
time
when
you
and
i
are
asleep
and
when
the
waving
with
ferns
and
fuchsias
move
up
the
strand
like
birnam
wood
moving
to
dunsinane
on
those
days
she
was
due
home
at
four
or
so
on
other
days
she
was
able
to
have
a
late
breakfast
and
to
darn
her
stockings
after
it
but
that
meant
that
she
did
not
get
home
till
very
late
some
i
gather
are
called
single
but
in
this
case
the
word
does
not
imply
celibacy
alone
the
single
is
occupied
by
one
conductor
all
day
jong
for
a
fortnight
the
double
is
shared
by
two
conductors
one
presiding
in
the
morning
and
the
other
in
the
afternoon
the
double
state
also
lasts
a
fortnight
it
is
arranged
as
an
opportunity
for
lady
to
recuperate
after
the
rigours
the
more
remunerative
rigours
of
service
on
a
single
these
statements
of
mine
are
open
to
extensive
correction
jay
hours
always
struck
me
as
so
very
confusing
that
it
is
unlikely
i
should
be
able
to
retail
the
information
correctly
however
it
does
matter
very
much
this
was
one
of
the
early
days
on
a
double
and
jay
was
on
her
last
journey
with
several
restless
waking
hours
between
her
and
possible
sleep
her
was
full
but
not
pressed
down
and
running
over
for
the
moment
everybody
in
it
was
provided
with
a
ticket
jay
was
laboriously
thinking
small
thoughts
because
she
was
tired
of
thinking
of
love
and
life
and
other
things
with
capital
letters
she
thought
of
the
various
indignities
to
which
the
public
submits
its
some
people
use
the
ticket
as
a
toothpick
some
put
spectacles
on
and
read
it
without
understanding
some
decorate
outstanding
features
of
the
with
it
but
i
myself
tear
it
gradually
into
small
strips
and
grind
the
strips
by
means
of
massage
into
fine
powder
if
the
inspector
comes
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
pour
the
powder
into
his
hand
and
yet
he
often
seems
annoyed
jay
reviewed
the
perspective
of
faces
that
lined
her
they
were
all
ugly
and
not
one
of
them
was
eager
the
british
public
as
a
whole
considers
a
deaf
dumb
and
blind
expression
the
only
decent
one
to
wear
in
a
public
conveyance
we
roar
through
a
wonderful
and
exciting
world
and
all
the
while
we
sit
with
glazed
eyes
and
in
our
ears
and
think
about
ourselves
they
were
mostly
men
in
jay
at
that
moment
they
were
almost
all
alike
and
all
insignificant
but
not
one
of
them
knew
it
such
a
lot
of
men
could
never
be
loved
by
women
only
found
expedient
but
there
was
a
sailor
a
simple
sitting
by
the
door
sailors
are
a
race
apart
they
have
twisty
faces
their
boots
and
gloves
look
curiously
accidental
in
london
they
are
rarely
seen
without
a
or
a
in
their
grasp
there
is
something
about
a
sailor
that
conduces
to
sentiment
in
every
and
jay
who
was
fleeing
from
that
very
feeling
looked
hastily
at
some
one
else
her
seeking
eye
lit
on
a
lady
who
had
a
complete
skunk
climbing
up
the
nape
of
her
neck
and
a
hat
of
the
approximate
size
of
a
piece
worn
over
her
right
eyebrow
she
looked
such
a
fool
that
jay
concluded
that
the
look
was
intentional
and
indeed
i
suppose
it
must
be
for
the
worst
insult
you
can
offer
to
young
ladies
of
this
type
is
to
suggest
that
they
have
brains
jay
pondered
on
this
and
then
turned
elsewhere
for
inspiration
all
roads
of
thought
at
that
time
led
to
one
destination
so
she
only
allowed
herself
to
go
a
little
way
along
each
road
and
presently
she
reached
the
end
of
her
journey
she
walked
home
and
chloris
was
as
usual
waiting
for
her
just
outside
the
factory
at
the
corner
jay
as
she
passed
that
factory
every
day
watched
with
interest
the
progress
of
the
grey
ghost
eyeless
maneless
and
tailless
as
they
ripened
hourly
into
a
form
more
like
that
of
the
friend
of
youth
she
smelt
the
little
smell
that
is
always
astray
in
mabel
place
she
heard
outside
in
the
damp
afternoon
two
rival
howling
a
cry
that
sounded
like
one
pound
a
neighbour
in
the
garden
was
exchanging
repartee
with
a
gentleman
caller
biby
siy
naughty
man
biby
tell
what
a
caution
is
but
there
seemed
little
hope
that
the
baby
would
these
sounds
were
provided
with
the
constant
brown
borough
background
of
shouts
and
quarrels
and
laughter
and
children
crying
and
innumerable
noises
of
work
something
has
happened
said
jay
to
chloris
as
they
went
in
i
feel
as
if
i
had
no
friends
not
even
a
secret
friend
chloris
lay
on
her
lap
in
her
usual
attitude
bent
into
a
circle
like
a
tinned
tongue
chloris
knew
it
was
no
use
worrying
about
these
things
funny
thought
jay
king
david
was
a
healthy
man
of
ruddy
countenance
and
presumably
he
never
lived
in
the
brown
borough
yet
he
knew
very
well
what
it
feels
like
to
have
a
temperature
and
a
sore
heart
and
to
be
alone
in
lodgings
whenever
i
am
very
tired
it
is
funny
how
my
heart
quotes
those
tired
psalms
of
his
without
my
brain
remembering
the
words
i
wonder
how
david
knew
the
little
house
was
empty
but
for
her
i
ought
perhaps
to
have
told
you
before
that
nana
had
been
taken
ill
a
month
or
so
ago
and
had
gone
away
at
jay
expense
to
a
south
coast
home
i
go
round
and
see
edwards
said
jay
when
she
had
changed
into
mufti
neither
chloris
nor
david
is
adequate
to
the
moment
the
back
room
of
edwards
was
crowded
the
chap
from
the
top
floor
was
there
and
mrs
dusty
morgan
and
little
love
from
tann
street
and
edwards
daughter
queenie
and
several
people
children
conversation
never
wavered
as
jay
knocked
and
came
in
when
you
find
that
your
entrance
no
longer
fills
a
brown
borough
room
with
sudden
silence
you
may
be
glad
and
know
that
you
have
ceased
to
be
a
lidy
or
a
toff
the
chap
from
the
top
floor
was
talking
and
everybody
else
was
there
to
hear
him
do
it
except
edwards
who
could
hardly
bear
it
because
she
only
liked
listening
to
herself
jay
sat
modestly
in
a
corner
and
listened
like
the
other
representatives
of
her
generation
the
chap
from
the
top
floor
was
an
older
and
wiser
man
his
wife
could
not
live
with
him
but
he
was
very
kind
and
fatherly
to
every
one
else
and
jay
was
rather
fond
of
him
he
was
about
fifty
and
anything
but
beautiful
also
the
would
not
have
admired
him
but
i
believe
he
did
a
good
deal
of
thinking
inside
that
bristly
head
of
his
ow
my
dear
said
edwards
laying
a
fat
hand
on
jay
knee
we
all
so
dusty
wrote
to
siy
got
the
sack
from
the
army
becos
of
rheumatics
we
a
bit
of
a
beano
becos
of
it
everybody
smiled
at
jay
and
her
heart
grew
warmer
some
one
handed
her
a
cup
of
tea
sweetened
with
half
an
inch
of
sugar
at
the
bottom
of
the
cup
the
spoon
had
been
plunged
to
its
hilt
in
condensed
milk
what
vulgar
tastes
she
had
you
can
never
mike
a
pal
of
a
woman
said
the
chap
from
the
top
floor
continuing
an
argument
for
the
benefit
of
an
audience
of
women
one
feller
an
another
well
a
pal
a
pal
but
women
are
all
either
wives
or
there
ai
no
manner
of
palliness
in
them
gentlemanly
to
talk
so
elbert
said
edwards
yore
mother
was
a
woman
an
from
comes
all
you
know
i
thinkin
all
you
are
women
is
pals
with
women
an
men
is
pals
with
men
only
when
men
an
women
gets
that
palliness
drops
out
an
wives
can
be
pals
said
mrs
dusty
me
an
dusty
useter
a
drop
an
a
jaw
together
every
night
for
three
months
after
we
married
never
a
thought
apart
we
did
if
i
dusty
said
the
top
floor
chap
i
do
know
but
what
would
tell
a
different
tile
you
can
talk
an
you
a
suffragette
said
mrs
dusty
ai
bein
a
pal
just
as
much
a
woman
job
as
a
man
what
is
bein
a
pal
asked
love
bitterly
some
one
drinks
wiv
you
until
she
sick
and
then
blacks
your
eye
for
you
there
ai
no
pals
men
or
women
i
think
they
rare
said
jay
is
being
a
pal
just
refusing
to
admit
a
limit
some
people
draw
the
line
at
a
murderer
and
some
at
a
suffragette
and
some
at
a
vegetarian
and
some
at
a
lady
who
wears
the
same
dress
sundays
and
but
a
real
pal
draws
no
line
women
and
dogs
as
well
as
men
can
be
faithful
beyond
limit
i
think
but
it
very
rare
in
anybody
do
know
nothink
said
the
chap
from
the
top
floor
in
a
loud
belligerent
voice
illuminated
by
an
amiable
smile
i
orfen
look
at
an
think
devils
they
do
know
of
life
not
even
a
quarter
they
only
meets
the
harisocracy
wot
pennies
to
frow
about
they
never
passes
the
time
of

with
a
plain
feller
like

devils
elbert
your
jaw
said
the
tactful
edwards
nervous
lest
jay
should
resent
this
insult
to
her
calling
let
all
go
roun
to
the
beetle
an
see
whether
that
wo
stop
noise
after
all
it
dusty
birfdiy
said
mrs
dusty
with
alacrity
the
day
was
evidently
growing
in
importance
every
minute
you
come
along
too
said
little
love
suddenly
putting
her
hand
in
jay
no
treatin
nowadiys
said
the
top
floor
chap
amiably
but
i
mind
around
the
price
of
a
drink
before
we
start
he
only
extended
generosity
to
jay
because
she
was
after
all
a
and
to
that
extent
a
nob
she
shook
her
head
and
laughed
when
he
held
out
to
her
the
coin
edwards
only
really
found
scope
for
her
voice
out
of
doors
no
sooner
was
she
in
the
street
than
she
seized
the
arm
of
the
chap
from
the
top
floor
and
shouted
him
down
as
she
led
him
towards
the
beetle
mrs
dusty
and
young
queenie
walked
arm
in
arm
behind
them
and
whenever
they
saw
a
soldier
they
squeaked
loudly
and
addressed
him
invariably
as
colonel
mawmajuke
jay
and
little
love
both
rather
confused
and
unhappy
people
walked
hand
in
hand
a
little
way
behind
we
need
go
as
fur
as
the
beetle
if
we
do
like
said
love
they
never
notice
if
we
it
i
do
want
to
it
said
jay
i
want
to
keep
very
busy
listening
to
noisy
people
i
do
want
to
hear
myself
think
you
mopey
eh
asked
love
gently
i
cold
said
jay
i
believe
i
lost
something
i
believe
i
lost
a
friend
of
mine
friends
is
always
gettin
lost
said
love
i
told
you
so
go
an
a
look
at
the
pictures
they
got
the
of
a
crook
on
up
the
street
fairly
mike
yer
curl
i
want
noise
said
jay
a
much
louder
noise
than
that
old
piano
the
pictures
are
so
horribly
quiet
just
an
underfed
man
turning
a
handle
and
an
underfed
woman
hitting
an
underfed
piano
at
a
play
you
can
at
least
pretend
that
the
actors
are
having
a
little
fun
too
but
the
pictures
there
only
two
sad
people
without
smiles
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
i
wo
go
to
the
pictures
i
go
and
get
drunk
come
on
then
said
love
you
wo
find
no
lost
friends
there
but
come
on
i
be
yer
pal
for
you
been
a
pal
to
me
before
now
we
pals
right
enough
there
ai
no
permanent
kind
you
wo
find
no
shivers
straying
around
in
the
ole
beetle
let
an
get
drunk
and
keep
in
all
the
time
wot
pals
oughter
do
jay
suddenly
saw
the
whole
world
as
a
thing
running
away
from
its
thoughts
the
crowd
that
filled
the
pavement
was
fugitive
and
every
man
felt
the
hot
breath
of
fear
on
the
back
of
his
neck
one
only
used
voice
for
the
drowning
of
one
thoughts
one
only
used
one
feet
for
running
away
the
whole
world
was
in
flight
along
the
endless
streets
and
the
lucky
ones
were
in
trams
and
donkey
carts
that
they
might
flee
the
faster
hurry
hurry
said
jay
and
she
and
little
love
ran
hand
in
hand
the
chap
from
the
top
floor
and
edwards
were
already
leading
society
in
the
beetle
when
jay
and
love
reached
it
the
barman
knew
edwards
too
well
to
think
that
she
was
drunk
already
but
you
or
i
transported
suddenly
thither
would
have
supposed
that
her
beano
was
over
instead
of
yet
to
come
said
edwards
yo
an
yo
an
internal
alien
thet
what
the
metter
with
you
i
wonder
i
blacked
yer
eye
for
you
many
a
time
and
oft
there
was
almost
enough
noise
even
for
jay
and
she
and
love
each
armed
with
a
generously
topped
glass
sat
in
the
background
on
the
shiny
seat
that
lined
the
wall
to
jay
this
evening
was
an
experiment
an
experiment
born
of
weariness
of
a
road
she
watched
love
blow
some
of
the
superfluous
froth
on
to
the
floor
and
did
likewise
directly
she
had
put
her
lips
to
the
thick
brim
of
her
glass
she
knew
that
here
was
the
stuff
of
which
certain
dreams
are
made
she
had
i
suppose
the
weakest
head
in
the
world
and
in
three
minutes
she
was
giddy
and
much
comforted
the
noise
seemed
to
clothe
itself
in
a
veil
of
music
there
was
hope
in
the
shining
brightness
that
shone
from
the
bar
the
placards
that
looked
like
texts
and
were
advertisements
of
various
drinks
seemed
like
jokes
to
jay
there
are
only
dreams
she
thought
very
lucidly
to
keep
our
souls
alive
we
are
lucky
if
we
get
good
dreams
we
never
get
anything
better
through
the
glass
between
the
patriotic
posters
that
darkened
the
windows
she
could
see
the
morbid
colour
of
london
air
apart
from
dreams
thought
this
busconducting
omar
khayyám
there
is
nothing
but
disappointment
we
expected
too
much
we
expected
satisfaction
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
but
second
bests
but
dreams
are
an
excellent
second
best
our
last
attitude
must
be
interesting
but
how
very
far
from
what
i
wanted
the
speed
of
time
and
the
hurry
of
life
suddenly
rushed
upon
her
again
i
must
hurry
she
said
or
i
sha
have
lived
before
i
die
i
must
hurry
no
jine
said
love
let
keep
in
the
light
for
a
bit
is
this
the
only
light
left
us
after
a
deluge
of
war
thought
jay
it
does
matter
because
of
course
war
is
hurrying
too
rushing
over
our
heads
like
the
sea
over
drowned
sailors
but
it
will
be
over
in
a
minute
this
new
kind
of
death
must
be
a
temporary
death
for
temporary
soldiers
what
do
fifty
years
without
friends
matter
you
can
hardly
breathe
before
they
done
she
was
dazzled
and
deafened
she
had
emptied
her
glass
and
she
did
not
know
what
steps
she
took
to
fill
it
again
only
she
found
it
was
suddenly
full
and
in
a
minute
she
was
on
the
path
to
the
house
by
the
sea
she
had
come
by
a
new
way
there
was
less
colour
than
usual
about
the
sea
a
certain
air
of
guilt
seemed
to
haunt
the
path
and
it
was
extraordinarily
lonely
there
seemed
to
be
no
promise
of
a
friend
waiting
at
the
other
end
of
the
path
she
sang
the
loud
song
to
encourage
herself
but
she
did
not
sing
it
very
loudly
there
is
no
dream
like
my
dream
even
in
heaven
there
is
no
friend
like
my
friend
even
in
heaven
there
is
no
life
like
my
life
even
in
heaven
a
voice
said
for
sike
jine
do
begin
to
sing
jay
laughed
treating
me
as
if
i
were
drunk
she
thought
she
did
not
feel
giddy
any
more
she
could
see
the
familiar
outline
of
the
house
against
an
unpretentious
sky
and
that
calm
shape
steadied
her
no
breath
of
sound
came
from
the
house
the
sky
was
grey
the
sea
was
grey
there
was
no
hint
of
sunlight
as
jay
came
to
the
door
she
noticed
that
the
honeysuckle
in
the
bowl
at
the
hall
window
was
still
there
but
dead
the
wind
had
strewn
the
doorstep
with
leaves
and
straws
and
twigs
little
refugees
of
the
air
in
the
hall
there
was
an
old
woman
dressed
in
a
black
dress
patterned
with
big
red
flowers
she
was
knitting
her
stiff
skirts
spread
out
in
angular
folds
round
her
jay
knew
she
was
a
because
their
eyes
met
jay
felt
swallowed
up
by
the
silence
she
could
not
speak
even
to
think
she
felt
would
be
too
noisy
the
stiff
skirt
of
the
old
lady
made
no
rustle
the
knitting
needles
made
no
click
but
jay
could
see
that
she
was
counting
the
house
seemed
to
be
full
of
unmoving
time
outside
the
rain
began
to
fall
and
that
grey
sound
enclosed
the
silence
of
the
house
after
a
very
long
time
jay
spoke
where
is
my
friend
she
asked
gone
to
the
war
answered
the
old
woman
there
is
no
war
in
this
world
said
jay
on
the
contrary
the
replied
war
is
even
here
where
time
is
not
war
is
like
air
in
every
house
in
every
land
on
every
sea
for
ever
between
her
sentences
she
counted
unpausing
numbers
moved
her
lips
on
these
shores
she
said
time
and
life
and
the
sea
go
up
and
down
eternity
has
no
logic
there
are
no
reasons
there
is
no
explanation
but
there
is
always
war
there
are
fighting
sea
men
in
the
caves
on
the
beach
have
you
seen
them
the
dark
sea
people
have
you
heard
their
high
voices
that
were
tuned
to
cut
through
the
voice
of
the
sea
have
you
found
their
very
wide
footprints
in
the
sand
have
you
walked
blind
through
this
world
no
said
jay
i
remember
the
women
decorate
their
hair
with
seaweed
pink
and
green
i
have
watched
them
catch
fish
with
their
hands
i
have
watched
them
put
their
babies
to
play
in
the
pools
among
the
rocks
on
the
cliffs
said
the
men
clad
in
armour
share
the
camps
of
the
englishmen
who
fought
at
cressy
and
at
waterloo
and
at
the
marne
on
these
seas
the
most
ancient
pirates
sing
and
laugh
in
chorus
with
nelson
drowned
sailors
and
with
men
from
the
north
sea
men
whose
mothers
still
cry
in
the
night
for
them
did
you
think
there
was
any
seniority
in
eternity
but
i
do
understand
said
jay
time
seems
to
leave
itself
behind
so
quickly
there
is
nothing
to
understand
said
the
old
woman
there
is
no
explanation
time
does
not
move
men
move
the
noise
of
the
rain
seemed
to
wash
out
everything
but
remembrance
and
there
was
no
feeling
in
jay
but
a
terrible
longing
to
have
her
secret
friend
with
her
again
and
that
long
secret
childhood
of
theirs
and
to
wipe
out
half
her
days
and
all
her
knowledge
and
to
hear
once
more
those
songs
upon
the
sands
of
the
cove
and
to
feel
the
tingling
ground
of
the
sunny
hills
my
friend
has
never
forsaken
me
before
she
said
she
felt
a
hand
press
her
hand
and
she
met
the
eyes
of
little
love
yo
a
mousey
sort
of
kid
said
love
sittin
there
as
if
you
was
in
church
shall
we
go
the
rine
gettin
worse
an
worse
it
no
good
wytin
i
see
you
when
jay
very
wet
and
dazed
reached
eighteen
mabel
place
she
found
a
card
pushed
under
the
door
the
name
on
it
was
herbert
russell
and
there
was
a
suggestion
in
a
beautiful
little
handwriting
on
the
back
of
it
that
she
should
ring
him
up
next
morning
and
tell
him
when
to
come
and
see
her
as
he
had
a
message
from
her
brother
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
could
possibly
happen
in
real
life
said
jay
i
must
be
drunk
after
all
on
no
doorstep
except
could
one
find
a
message
so
romantic
she
was
instinctively
disobedient
to
older
and
wiser
people
she
never
entertained
the
idea
of
telephoning
she
could
imagine
russell
answering
the
telephone
in
a
prosaic
voice
like
a
double
bass
she
wrote
the
following
letter
dear
sir
do
you
remember
i
was
to
meet
you
anyway
on
the
steps
of
paul
at
ten
next
sunday
i
will
wait
till
then
for
the
yours
faithfully
jane
elizabeth
martin
that
letter
ought
to
put
two
and
two
together
for
him
she
thought
if
he
has
done
it
already
it
a
complicated
little
sum
and
the
result
is
what
she
felt
hot
and
feverish
when
she
wrote
the
letter
and
directly
she
had
posted
it
she
regretted
having
done
so
i
forget
what
i
wrote
she
said
it
is
dangerous
to
post
letters
to
older
and
wiser
men
when
drunk
all
that
night
she
lay
awake
and
mourned
the
desertion
of
her
secret
friend
you
promised
war
and
thunder
and
romance
you
promised
true
but
we
were
very
blind
and
very
young
and
in
our
ignorance
we
never
called
to
mind
that
truth
is
seldom
kind
you
promised
love
immortal
as
a
star
you
promised
true
yet
how
the
truth
can
lie
for
now
we
grope
for
hands
where
no
hands
are
and
deathless
still
we
cry
nor
hope
for
a
reply
you
promised
harvest
and
a
perfect
yield
you
promised
true
for
on
the
harvest
morn
behold
a
reaper
strode
across
the
field
and
man
of
woman
born
was
gathered
in
as
corn
you
promised
honour
and
ordeal
by
flame
you
promised
true
in
joy
we
trembled
lest
we
should
be
found
unworthy
when
it
came
but
oh
we
never
guessed
the
fury
of
the
test
you
promised
friends
and
songs
and
festivals
you
promised
true
our
friends
who
still
are
young
assemble
for
their
feasting
in
those
halls
where
speaks
no
human
tongue
and
thus
our
songs
are
sung
i
have
very
rarely
found
sunday
in
london
a
successful
day
i
hate
idleness
without
peace
and
festivity
without
beauty
and
noise
without
music
i
hate
to
see
london
people
in
unnatural
clothes
i
hate
to
see
a
city
holding
its
breath
jay
waited
ten
minutes
on
the
steps
of
paul
for
russell
this
was
not
because
he
was
late
but
because
she
was
early
and
this
again
was
not
because
she
was
indecently
eager
but
because
she
had
hit
on
an
unexpectedly
she
felt
a
fool
for
ten
minutes
and
when
you
have
waited
ten
minutes
on
those
enormous
steps
under
the
eye
of
the
pigeons
you
will
know
why
she
felt
a
fool
russell
arrived
in
christina
the
motor
car
and
simultaneously
a
shower
fell
from
the
first
moment
jay
felt
unsuccess
in
the
air
of
that
day
she
was
introduced
to
christina
and
said
but
we
ca
take
that
thing
into
the
cathedral
we
do
want
to
said
russell
although
as
he
was
a
born
driver
the
challenge
made
him
instinctively
measure
with
his
eye
the
depth
of
the
steps
and
the
width
of
the
doorway
from
christina
point
of
view
we
do
want
to
pray
we
want
to
talk
anonyma
would
have
been
astonished
to
hear
him
say
this
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
jay
i
brought
chloris
for
the
same
reason
chloris
was
eating
the
bread
which
a
kind
but
old
lady
believed
herself
to
be
giving
to
the
pigeons
russell
had
hardly
been
able
to
imagine
his
in
any
dress
but
that
of
her
calling
now
that
he
saw
her
in
unambitious
things
he
was
glad
to
notice
that
her
clothes
were
not
sunday
clothes
but
the
sort
that
you
forget
about
directly
you
look
away
from
them
this
was
the
sort
of
day
that
breaks
up
delusions
and
as
christina
the
motor
car
started
away
jay
discovered
that
her
hat
was
not
adequately
attached
to
her
head
there
are
few
discoveries
more
depressing
than
this
at
the
beginning
of
a
day
of
movement
the
bells
of
paul
began
to
sing
little
fairy
bells
dodged
behind
and
about
the
great
notes
but
christina
soon
swept
the
sound
into
the
forgotten
air
behind
her
i
got
a
lot
to
talk
to
you
about
said
russell
as
he
headed
christina
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
taking
his
miracle
curiously
for
granted
i
do
think
he
really
believed
in
it
yet
for
russell
all
truth
was
haunted
by
the
ghost
of
a
clanking
lie
he
discerned
deceit
on
the
part
of
providence
where
no
deceit
was
give
you
your
brother
message
first
because
it
interests
me
personally
least
he
is
gone
there
was
a
sudden
move
across
the
channel
last
week
and
he
went
i
suppose
ten
days
ago
now
the
message
he
had
time
to
give
you
was
an
appeal
to
give
up
he
had
an
absurd
idea
that
you
walked
out
with
in
victoria
park
not
at
all
absurd
said
jay
not
half
so
absurd
as
the
idea
of
driving
out
with
a
casual
fare
i
know
some
delightful
conductors
and
drivers
we
joke
together
when
the
traffic
sticks
there
is
one
perfect
darling
called
edward
his
only
fault
is
that
he
drives
a
mere
steamer
but
we
always
bow
and
once
when
a
horse
fell
down
and
we
got
hung
up
for
twenty
minutes
in
the
strand
he
sang
me
a
little
song
about
a
star
russell
listened
to
all
this
very
attentively
and
then
continued
your
brother
wants
you
to
go
back
to
your
family
his
last
words
to
me
about
it
were
that
if
you
could
manage
to
be
ladylike
for
three
years
or
the
duration
of
war
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
and
you
would
go
and
live
by
your
two
selves
in
new
zealand
and
if
you
liked
you
need
wear
no
skirts
at
all
there
but
riding
breeches
all
the
time
ladylike
snorted
jay
what
the
use
of
ladyliquity
even
for
five
minutes
so
kew
sent
you
as
an
antidote
i
suppose
he
did
know
you
were
one
of
my
fares
a
fare
said
russell
sententiously
may
i
suppose
be
a
wonderful
revelation
because
you
only
see
your
fare
eyes
for
a
second
and
the
things
you
may
see
have
no
limit
and
you
never
know
the
silly
little
truth
about
him
yet
even
so
there
is
more
than
a
ticket
and
a
look
between
you
and
me
and
you
know
it
possibly
there
is
a
secret
world
between
you
and
me
said
jay
but
that
a
pretty
big
thing
to
divide
us
supposing
it
does
divide
us
said
russell
looking
fiercely
at
the
road
in
front
of
him
supposing
it
showed
me
how
much
i
love
you
how
disappointing
said
jay
in
the
worst
of
possible
taste
she
was
like
that
you
ceasing
to
be
an
older
and
wiser
and
trying
to
become
an
ordinary
nearah
and
dearah
oh
curse
she
thought
in
brackets
i
shall
kick
myself
that
a
horrid
thing
to
say
said
russell
but
still
i
do
love
you
it
sounds
very
victorian
and
nice
said
jay
wondering
if
he
could
still
see
her
through
her
veil
of
bad
temper
but
you
know
in
spite
of
secret
worlds
and
secret
souls
and
centuries
of
secret
knowledge
we
still
have
to
keep
up
this
farce
and
leave
something
of
ourselves
in
sensible
london
how
do
i
know
you
not
married
russell
thought
for
a
very
long
time
indeed
and
then
said
i
am
jay
was
not
very
well
brought
up
she
did
not
stop
the
car
and
step
out
with
dignity
into
respectable
hackney
she
was
just
silent
for
a
long
time
as
you
were
she
said
to
herself
when
she
found
herself
able
to
think
again
this
is
a
bad
day
but
it
will
be
over
in
something
less
than
a
hundred
years
you
drive
well
she
said
presently
looking
with
relief
from
russell
face
to
his
hands
christina
the
motor
car
and
two
were
just
then
indulging
in
a
figure
like
the
opening
steps
of
the
grand
chain
you
drive
as
though
driving
were
poetry
and
every
mile
a
verse
after
all
she
told
herself
the
man
loves
me
and
i
must
at
least
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
him
are
you
a
poet
she
added
nobody
had
ever
asked
russell
this
question
before
and
not
knowing
the
answer
to
it
he
did
not
answer
i
have
never
written
a
line
of
poetry
said
jay
or
rather
i
have
several
times
written
a
line
but
never
another
line
to
fit
it
yet
because
i
have
a
friend
i
know
in
what
curious
and
extended
order
the
verses
come
and
how
the
tunes
come
first
and
the
various
voices
next
and
the
words
last
and
how
a
good
rhyme
warms
you
like
a
fire
and
how
the
tunes
fall
away
when
the
thing
is
finished
and
how
it
all
is
really
and
yet
how
tired
you
feel
to
russell
it
all
seemed
true
and
part
of
the
miracle
he
had
nothing
to
add
and
therefore
added
nothing
obviously
you
are
a
poet
said
jay
you
have
a
poetic
look
what
look
is
that
asked
russell
much
pleased
it
was
twenty
years
since
he
had
even
remembered
that
he
possessed
a
look
of
his
own
a
silly
sullen
look
said
jay
presently
she
added
but
it
must
have
been
disappointing
to
find
yourself
a
poet
in
victorian
times
i
always
think
of
you
olders
and
wisers
as
coming
out
of
your
stuffy
nineteenth
century
into
our
nice
new
age
with
a
sigh
of
relief
oh
no
said
russell
you
must
remember
that
when
we
were
born
into
it
it
became
our
nice
new
age
and
therefore
to
us
there
is
no
age
like
it
it
seems
incredible
said
jay
did
older
and
wiser
people
ever
live
violently
ever
work
work
hard
until
their
brains
were
blind
and
they
cried
because
they
were
so
tired
did
they
ever
get
drowned
in
seas
full
of
foaming
ambitions
did
they
ever
fight
without
dignity
but
with
joy
for
a
cause
did
they
ever
shout
and
jump
with
joy
in
their
pyjamas
in
the
moonlight
did
they
ever
feel
just
drunk
with
being
young
and
in
at
the
start
and
were
older
and
wiser
people
jokes
ever
funny
we
were
fools
often
said
russell
once
when
i
was
fifteen
i
bit
my
hand
and
here
is
the
scar
because
i
thought
i
had
found
a
new
thing
in
life
and
i
thought
i
was
the
first
discoverer
but
as
to
jokes
you
are
on
very
dangerous
ground
there
one
sense
of
humour
is
a
more
tender
point
than
one
heart
especially
an
older
and
wiser
sense
of
humour
you
know
we
think
the
jokes
of
your
nice
new
age
not
half
so
funny
as
ours
but
as
neither
you
nor
i
make
jokes
that
obstacle
need
not
come
between
us
oh
i
think
difference
of
date
is
never
in
itself
an
obstacle
said
jay
time
is
not
important
enough
to
be
an
obstacle
you
and
i
know
that
said
russell
a
little
unnoticed
knot
of
salvationists
surprised
jay
at
a
distance
by
singing
the
tune
of
a
sentimental
song
popular
five
years
ago
and
then
they
surprised
her
again
as
she
passed
them
and
heard
the
words
to
which
the
tune
was
being
sung
brimstone
had
usurped
the
place
of
the
roses
in
that
song
and
the
love
left
in
it
was
not
apparently
the
kind
of
love
that
hackney
understands
why
do
they
sing
the
old
hymn
tunes
asked
jay
or
tunes
like
with
me
not
very
old
or
very
good
but
worn
down
with
devotion
like
the
steps
of
an
old
church
why
do
they
take
the
drama
out
of
it
all
chloris
at
that
moment
introduced
drama
into
the
drive
by
jumping
out
of
the
back
seat
of
christina
i
must
i
suppose
admit
that
chloris
was
not
really
quite
a
lady
on
the
contrary
motor
were
the
only
motors
she
knew
she
mistook
the
estimable
christina
for
a
deformed
motor
and
when
she
smelt
victoria
park
she
jumped
out
even
for
chloris
this
was
an
unsuccessful
day
a
flash
of
yelping
lightning
caught
the
tail
of
jay
eye
and
she
looked
round
to
see
her
dignified
dog
upside
down
skid
violently
down
a
steep
place
into
the
gutter
and
there
disappear
beneath
the
skirt
of
a
female
stranger
who
was
poised
upon
the
kerb
unhurt
but
probably
blushing
furiously
beneath
her
fur
over
her
own
vulgarity
chloris
was
retrieved
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
drive
in
wiping
all
traces
of
the
accident
off
her
ribs
on
to
the
cushions
of
christina
i
am
glad
that
russell
hound
was
not
there
to
witness
poor
chloris
unsophisticated
confession
of
caste
where
are
we
going
asked
jay
when
she
was
calm
again
god
knows
where
said
russell
i
always
coming
across
districts
of
that
name
said
jay
severely
i
often
direct
my
enquiring
fares
to
the
region
of
god
knows
where
it
is
most
unsatisfying
where
are
we
going
on
for
ever
said
russell
out
of
the
world
to
the
house
by
the
sea
then
will
you
please
set
me
down
at
baker
arms
said
jay
do
you
know
by
the
way
that
anonyma
always
says
to
a
if
she
remembers
in
time
not
to
say
stop
like
a
common
person
she
was
talking
desperately
against
failure
but
it
seemed
a
doomed
day
and
nothing
she
could
think
of
seemed
worth
saying
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
your
house
by
the
sea
said
russell
you
know
i
found
it
do
tell
me
any
facts
implored
jay
do
tell
me
you
pressed
half
a
crown
into
the
palm
of
the
oldest
and
wisest
inhabitant
and
found
out
facts
about
some
nasty
young
man
who
was
born
in
seventeen
something
and
lived
in
a
place
called
atlantic
view
and
wore
curls
and
a
choky
stock
and
fought
at
waterloo
and
lies
in
the
village
church
under
a
stone
monstrosity
do
tell
me
facts
because
i
know
they
will
bar
me
for
ever
out
of
my
house
by
the
sea
facts
are
contraband
there
there
is
no
house
by
that
sea
now
said
russell
a
slate
quarry
has
devoured
the
headland
on
which
it
used
to
stand
where
the
house
used
to
be
there
is
air
now
i
daresay
the
ghosts
you
knew
still
trace
out
the
shape
of
the
house
in
the
air
the
ghosts
i
know
corrected
jay
do
put
it
in
the
past
it
all
in
the
past
said
russell
it
all
a
dream
and
an
echo
and
the
ghost
of
the
day
before
yesterday
how
do
you
know
asked
jay
how
can
you
tell
it
not
the
ghost
she
had
been
taught
by
her
friend
to
take
very
few
things
for
granted
and
time
least
of
all
i
asked
you
to
tell
me
no
facts
she
added
i
only
tell
you
two
persisted
russell
one
is
that
they
have
in
the
church
near
the
quarry
a
dark
wooden
figure
of
a
saint
with
the
raised
arm
broken
and
straight
draperies
i
saw
it
and
they
told
me
what
i
knew
already
that
it
came
out
of
the
hall
of
a
house
that
was
drowned
in
the
sea
the
other
fact
is
a
story
that
the
tobacconist
told
me
about
a
wriggly
ladder
and
stone
balls
and
the
law
in
the
tobacconist
childhood
they
found
the
stone
balls
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
in
the
sand
that
story
too
i
knew
already
quite
apart
from
your
letters
you
little
secret
friend
i
knew
the
face
of
that
sea
directly
i
saw
it
but
how
did
you
know
how
dared
you
know
oh
well
said
russell
you
asked
me
to
tell
you
no
facts
russell
was
not
observant
he
was
not
sufficiently
alive
to
be
observant
he
was
much
occupied
in
remembering
phantom
yesterdays
and
i
do
not
think
he
listened
very
much
to
what
the
said
he
only
enjoyed
the
sound
of
her
voice
which
he
remembered
so
he
did
not
know
that
she
was
unhappy
they
came
presently
to
a
separate
part
of
the
forest
which
is
impaled
upon
a
straight
white
road
the
earth
beneath
the
trees
was
caught
in
a
mesh
of
shadows
the
trees
are
high
and
vaulted
there
but
the
forest
is
very
reticent
the
detail
of
its
making
is
so
small
that
you
can
only
see
it
if
you
lie
down
on
your
face
do
this
and
you
can
see
the
green
threads
of
the
earth
material
woven
across
the
skeletons
of
last
leaves
you
can
see
the
little
lawns
of
moss
and
weeds
too
small
to
name
that
make
the
way
brilliant
for
the
ants
you
can
watch
the
heroic
armoured
beetles
defying
their
world
you
can
cover
with
a
leaf
the
great
public
of
things
you
can
see
the
spiders
at
work
on
their
silver
cranes
you
can
watch
the
bold
elevated
activities
of
the
caterpillars
you
can
feel
the
scattered
grasses
stroke
your
eyelids
you
can
hear
the
low
songs
of
fairies
among
the
roots
of
the
trees
all
these
things
you
may
enjoy
if
you
lie
down
but
the
forest
does
not
show
them
to
you
the
forest
pays
you
the
great
compliment
of
ignoring
you
and
it
does
not
care
whether
you
see
its
intimate
possessions
or
not
i
think
perhaps
no
day
is
really
unsuccessful
that
gives
you
forest
earth
against
your
forehead
and
forest
grass
between
your
fingers
and
high
forest
trees
to
stand
between
you
and
the
ultimate
confession
of
failure
jay
and
russell
boarded
out
christina
the
motor
car
for
the
day
at
an
inn
and
then
they
sat
and
gradually
introduced
themselves
to
the
forest
showers
fell
on
their
hatless
heads
and
they
did
not
notice
a
mole
rose
like
a
submarine
from
the
waves
of
the
forest
earth
and
they
did
not
notice
the
butterflies
danced
like
little
tunes
in
the
sunlit
clearing
and
they
did
not
notice
and
from
a
long
way
off
near
the
swings
holiday
shrieks
trailed
along
the
wind
and
they
did
not
notice
jay
told
russell
one
by
one
small
unmattering
things
that
she
remembered
out
of
her
secret
world
and
each
time
when
she
had
told
him
he
wondered
with
regret
why
he
had
not
remembered
it
by
himself
he
had
never
thought
it
worth
while
to
remember
before
his
imagination
was
crippled
and
needed
crutches
he
had
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
think
much
about
the
time
when
he
was
young
the
time
when
his
past
had
been
as
big
and
shining
as
his
future
the
longer
we
live
it
seems
the
less
we
remember
and
no
men
and
few
women
normally
possess
a
secret
story
after
thirty
it
would
not
matter
so
much
if
you
only
lost
your
story
a
worse
fate
than
loss
befalls
it
you
laugh
at
it
it
is
curious
how
the
world
draws
in
as
one
gets
older
and
wiser
the
past
catches
one
up
the
future
burns
away
like
a
candle
i
used
to
think
that
growing
up
was
like
walking
from
one
end
of
a
meadow
to
the
other
i
thought
that
the
meadow
would
remain
and
one
had
only
to
turn
one
head
to
see
it
all
again
but
now
i
know
that
growing
up
is
like
going
through
a
door
into
a
little
room
and
the
door
shuts
behind
one
i
think
russell
point
of
difference
from
most
older
and
wiser
people
was
that
he
had
not
forgotten
the
excitement
of
writing
down
snatches
of
his
secret
story
as
it
came
to
him
and
the
passion
of
tearing
up
the
thing
that
he
wrote
and
the
delight
of
finding
that
he
could
not
tear
it
out
of
his
heart
he
was
a
silent
person
and
a
rather
neglected
person
and
unbusinesslike
and
unsuccessful
and
uncultured
and
unsociable
and
unbeautiful
so
there
was
nothing
worse
than
emptiness
where
his
secret
story
used
to
be
he
had
not
found
it
worth
while
to
fill
the
space
he
had
not
found
it
worth
while
to
shut
the
door
do
you
remember
that
christmas
said
jay
when
there
was
a
blizzard
and
a
great
sea
and
the
foam
blinded
the
western
windows
of
the
house
and
the
children
went
out
to
sing
and
joy
come
to
you
those
are
real
words
any
more
now
are
they
only
pretty
caricatures
and
when
the
children
came
in
with
snow
and
foam
plastered
up
their
windward
sides
do
you
remember
that
one
of
them
said
this
what
lot
wife
felt
like
i
can
just
remember
love
and
joy
mixed
up
with
the
wind
at
the
window
said
russell
but
always
best
of
all
i
can
remember
the
way
you
looked
on
me
said
jay
i
was
there
oh
yes
you
were
and
that
what
you
forget
you
were
there
always
and
when
i
was
looking
for
the
house
i
believe
it
was
always
you
i
was
expecting
to
find
there
me
me
with
this
same
old
face
gasped
jay
oh
excuse
me
but
you
lie
you
never
recognised
me
in
my
i
knew
without
knowing
i
knew
i
remembered
without
remembering
that
i
remembered
we
have
made
a
psychical
discovery
jay
we
have
done
nothing
to
write
a
book
about
only
you
remember
so
well
that
you
have
reminded
me
i
do
believe
that
can
be
true
said
jay
i
know
i
was
there
why
ca
you
see
the
truth
of
it
asked
russell
sighing
for
so
many
words
wasted
in
that
house
by
the
sea
who
was
your
secret
friend
my
friend
said
jay
is
young
and
very
full
of
youth
he
is
like
a
baby
who
knows
life
and
yet
finds
it
very
amusing
and
very
new
he
is
without
the
gift
of
rest
but
then
he
does
not
need
it
the
world
in
which
he
lives
is
not
so
tired
and
not
so
muddling
as
our
world
in
him
my
only
belief
and
my
only
colour
and
my
last
dregs
of
romance
and
certainly
my
youth
survive
we
never
bother
about
reserve
and
we
never
mind
being
sentimental
in
my
secret
world
we
just
live
and
we
are
never
tortured
by
the
futility
of
knowledge
well
said
russell
i
had
a
secret
friend
in
my
house
and
she
was
wonderful
because
she
was
so
young
that
she
knew
nothing
she
never
asked
questions
but
she
thought
questions
she
knew
nothing
she
was
waiting
to
grow
up
she
had
little
colour
only
peace
and
promise
i
knew
she
would
grow
up
but
i
also
knew
she
would
never
grow
old
i
knew
she
would
learn
much
but
i
also
knew
she
would
never
become
complete
and
ask
no
more
questions
that
voice
of
hers
would
always
end
on
a
questioning
note
you
see
i
have
found
my
secret
friend
grown
old
enough
to
enjoy
and
understand
a
new
and
more
vital
youth
shall
i
find
my
friend
asked
jay
yes
said
russell
in
a
very
low
voice
you
can
find
him
if
you
look
you
can
find
him
grown
very
old
and
ugly
and
tired
there
are
different
ways
of
growing
up
and
your
secret
friend
was
rash
in
using
up
too
great
a
share
of
his
sum
of
life
in
the
house
by
the
sea
then
jay
was
suddenly
enormously
happy
and
the
veil
of
failure
fell
away
from
the
day
and
from
her
life
she
held
in
her
hand
incredible
coincidences
the
angle
of
the
forest
the
upright
trees
upon
the
sloping
earth
the
bend
of
the
sky
the
round
bubble
shapes
of
the
clouds
upon
their
appointed
way
the
agreement
of
the
young
leaves
one
with
another
the
unfailing
pulse
of
the
spring
all
these
things
seemed
to
her
a
chance
an
unlikely
and
perfect
consummation
that
had
been
reached
only
by
the
extraordinary
cleverness
of
god
all
love
and
all
success
were
pressed
into
a
and
yet
the
target
was
never
missed
you
shall
go
down
to
the
house
by
the
sea
said
jay
you
shall
go
when
the
moon
is
next
full
over
the
sea
that
drowned
our
house
you
shall
come
from
the
east
along
the
rocky
path
as
you
used
to
come
between
the
foxgloves
you
shall
play
at
being
a
god
coming
between
the
stars
and
the
sea
and
i
will
play
at
being
a
goddess
as
i
used
to
play
at
being
a
ghost
and
i
will
run
to
meet
you
from
the
west
and
the
high
grasses
and
the
ferns
shall
whip
my
knees
and
the
thistles
shall
bow
to
me
and
the
sea
shall
be
very
calm
and
say
no
word
and
there
shall
be
no
ship
in
sight
and
we
will
go
down
the
steep
path
to
the
shore
and
we
will
stand
where
the
sand
is
wet
and
look
up
to
where
our
drowned
house
used
to
be
and
there
shall
be
no
facts
any
more
only
the
ghosts
and
the
dreams
oh
surely
it
has
never
happened
before
this
meeting
of
secret
friends
and
surely
no
friend
ever
loved
her
friend
as
i
love
you
and
surely
there
never
was
so
little
room
for
sin
and
disappointment
in
any
love
as
there
is
in
ours
surely
there
are
no
tears
in
the
world
any
more
and
no
brown
borough
and
no
war
i
do
care
if
i
go
hungry
every
day
till
we
meet
i
do
care
if
i
have
nothing
but
hated
clothes
to
wear
in
my
secret
world
i
do
care
if
there
are
six
changes
on
the
journey
to
the
sea
and
at
every
change
i
miss
my
connection
i
care
if
the
end
lasts
only
a
minute
because
the
minute
will
last
for
ever
there
are
no
facts
any
more
because
of
you
the
little
bothers
of
the
world
are
gone
and
the
big
bothers
never
did
exist
because
of
you
oh
i
can
say
what
i
mean
at
last
and
if
it
nonsense
i
do
care
because
of
you
presently
she
said
and
now
i
wonder
if
i
am
very
proud
or
very
much
ashamed
of
having
spoken
you
said
once
russell
reminded
her
that
life
was
just
a
bead
upon
a
string
well
does
it
much
matter
whether
one
bead
is
the
colour
of
pride
or
the
colour
of
shame
does
one
successful
bead
more
or
less
matter
my
dear
i
think
it
all
a
succession
of
explanations
more
or
less
lucid
and
all
different
and
all
confusing
a
string
of
beads
more
or
less
beautiful
and
all
unvalued
we
do
know
that
any
of
the
explanations
are
true
we
do
know
that
any
of
the
beads
have
any
worth
we
only
know
that
they
are
ours
i
do
care
if
i
trample
my
beads
in
the
mud
said
jay
now
let
go
home
and
think
when
she
and
chloris
got
home
that
evening
to
eighteen
mabel
place
chloris
barked
at
a
man
who
was
waiting
outside
the
door
he
was
a
young
man
in
khaki
with
one
star
he
looked
very
white
and
was
reading
something
from
his
great
scott
bill
said
jay
i
thought
you
were
busy
sapping
in
france
were
you
anywhere
near
kew
i
do
not
know
if
you
will
remember
the
name
of
young
william
morgan
i
think
i
have
only
mentioned
him
once
or
twice
i
got
back
on
leave
two
hours
ago
said
morgan
i
have
been
waiting
here
minutes
i
saw
kew
every
day
last
week
and
i
was
with
him
when
he
died
three
hours
before
i
came
away
yesterday
jay
was
silent
she
opened
the
door
and
in
the
she
placed
very
carefully
two
chairs
looking
at
each
other
across
the
table
jay
said
william
morgan
i
am
deadly
afraid
of
doing
this
badly
kew
and
i
talked
a
good
deal
before
it
happened
and
there
was
a
good
deal
he
wanted
me
to
tell
you
all
the
way
back
in
the
train
and
on
the
boat
i
have
been
writing
notes
to
remind
me
what
i
had
to
say
to
you
i
hope
you
do
mind
i
hope
you
do
think
it
callous
no
said
jay
he
was
very
anxious
you
should
know
the
truth
about
it
because
he
said
he
had
never
lied
to
you
he
was
always
sure
that
if
he
were
shot
it
would
be
in
the
back
while
he
was
lacing
his
boots
or
at
some
other
unromantic
moment
and
in
that
case
he
said
he
could
lie
to
anonyma
and
your
cousin
vicariously
through
the
war
office
which
would
write
to
them
about
glory
and
duty
and
thanks
due
but
he
wanted
me
to
write
to
you
and
tell
you
how
it
happened
and
tell
you
that
death
was
just
an
ordinary
old
thing
no
more
romantic
than
anything
else
without
a
capital
letter
and
that
one
died
as
one
had
lived
in
a
little
ordinary
way
and
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
glory
between
people
who
lie
to
each
other
i
am
telling
you
all
this
from
my
notes
i
should
never
have
thought
of
any
of
it
for
myself
as
you
know
i
hope
you
do
mind
no
said
jay
she
heard
what
he
said
yet
she
was
not
listening
her
mind
was
listening
to
things
heard
a
very
long
time
ago
she
heard
herself
and
kew
in
confidential
chorus
saying
those
laboriously
simple
prayers
that
anonyma
used
to
teach
them
she
heard
again
the
swishing
that
their
feet
used
to
make
in
the
leaves
of
kensington
gardens
was
the
louder
swish
by
right
she
thought
of
him
as
an
admirable
big
brother
of
eight
with
a
round
face
and
blunt
feet
and
very
hard
hands
she
heard
the
comfortable
roar
of
the
nursery
fire
and
the
comfortable
sound
of
autumn
rain
baffled
by
the
window
she
saw
the
early
winter
breakfast
by
lamplight
and
the
red
nursery
carpet
that
had
an
oblong
track
worn
away
round
the
table
by
the
frequent
game
of
little
men
jumping
she
heard
the
voice
of
kew
clamouring
against
the
voice
of
nana
because
he
would
not
eat
his
on
those
days
there
was
a
horrid
resurrection
at
luncheon
of
the
uneaten
at
breakfast
as
it
happened
continued
morgan
no
longer
white
but
very
red
he
was
killed
in
an
advance
or
anything
grand
he
told
me
to
tell
you
so
i
am
telling
you
he
was
killed
by
a
sniper
while
he
was
setting
a
trap
of
his
own
invention
to
catch
the
rats
as
they
came
over
the
parapet
he
was
shot
in
the
chest
very
early
yesterday
morning
and
he
lived
about
four
hours
he
was
not
in
much
pain
he
even
laughed
a
little
once
or
twice
to
think
he
should
have
lived
and
died
so
consistently
he
told
me
that
he
had
never
seen
a
moment
real
romantic
fighting
he
had
never
once
felt
patriotic
or
dramatic
or
dutiful
he
said
he
wandered
a
little
i
think
because
he
seemed
worried
about
the
rats
that
might
be
caught
in
the
trap
he
had
set
he
seemed
to
mix
up
the
rats
and
the
boches
he
said
that
these
creatures
did
know
they
were
vermin
they
just
thought
they
were
honest
average
animals
doing
their
bit
and
then
suddenly
killed
by
a
malignant
chaos
my
notes
are
very
hurried
i
am
afraid
i
am
repeating
myself
jay
remembered
the
mouse
they
once
caught
and
kept
in
a
bottle
for
a
day
and
the
palace
they
made
for
it
out
of
stones
and
mud
and
moss
and
the
of
patted
mud
they
made
by
the
door
of
the
palace
but
the
mouse
when
it
was
installed
flashed
straight
out
of
the
front
door
and
jumped
the
and
knocked
down
a
daisy
and
was
never
seen
again
but
jay
and
kew
used
to
believe
that
on
moonlit
nights
it
came
back
to
the
palace
and
brought
its
wife
and
children
and
was
grateful
to
the
palace
builders
a
few
days
before
he
was
killed
said
morgan
he
told
me
that
he
had
lied
so
successfully
all
his
life
that
quite
a
lot
of
people
thought
him
a
most
admirable
young
man
he
said
anonyma
once
brought
him
into
a
book
and
when
he
read
that
book
he
saw
how
lying
paid
as
long
as
one
did
lie
to
absolutely
everybody
he
said
if
he
died
anonyma
would
write
something
very
nice
upon
his
memorial
brass
about
a
pure
heart
or
everlasting
life
and
he
thought
you
would
smile
a
little
at
that
he
said
that
he
remembered
going
home
with
you
in
a
and
seeing
on
the
window
of
the
a
text
that
promised
everlasting
life
on
certain
conditions
he
said
the
remembrance
of
that
text
tired
him
still
he
said
he
had
had
too
much
of
himself
he
had
known
himself
too
well
and
when
death
came
he
wanted
it
to
be
an
honest
little
death
with
no
frills
and
after
that
an
everlasting
sleep
with
no
dreams
i
am
putting
it
all
in
the
wrong
order
i
shall
make
you
despise
me
you
talk
so
well
yourself
jay
was
remembering
the
coos
they
used
to
have
in
the
big
armchair
in
the
nursery
when
they
found
that
they
suddenly
loved
each
other
unbearably
they
had
a
coo
they
tied
themselves
up
in
a
little
tangle
together
and
sang
coo
in
soft
voices
and
then
they
felt
relieved
jay
remembered
the
last
coo
it
happened
when
kew
voice
was
breaking
ten
years
ago
and
he
found
that
he
could
no
longer
coo
except
in
a
funny
falsetto
so
rather
than
become
farcical
the
coos
ceased
i
do
know
quite
why
kew
wanted
me
to
tell
you
all
this
said
morgan
except
that
he
said
you
knew
so
much
about
him
that
you
might
as
well
get
as
near
as
possible
to
knowing
everything
he
never
thought
he
would
be
killed
in
fact
i
gave
him
a
lot
of
messages
of
my
own
to
give
to
my
mother
in
case
i
went
but
at
the
last
when
he
knew
he
was
dying
he
was
desperately
anxious
you
should
know
that
he
did
not
die
a
death
as
he
said
he
thought
any
hint
of
drama
about
his
death
would
spoil
your
friendship
he
said
you
knew
more
than
most
people
about
friends
and
he
thought
that
in
this
way
you
could
find
for
him
a
certain
immortality
which
would
make
the
soil
of
france
comfier
for
him
to
sleep
in
and
then
he
said
i
too
poetic
like
a
swan
do
report
me
too
accurately
he
seemed
to
go
to
sleep
for
some
time
after
that
and
every
now
and
then
he
laughed
very
faintly
in
his
sleep
i
had
to
leave
him
for
a
bit
and
when
i
came
back
he
was
still
asleep
the
only
thing
he
said
after
that
was
is
awfully
exciting
he
said
that
about
ten
minutes
before
he
died
i
hope
i
not
making
it
too
painful
for
you
dear
little
jay
no
said
jay
quite
irrelevantly
she
had
found
her
secret
friend
she
found
a
little
dark
wood
burnt
and
broken
by
fire
in
a
grey
light
and
there
was
a
wet
ditch
that
skirted
the
edge
of
it
she
saw
the
hopeless
and
regretful
sky
there
was
neither
night
nor
morning
in
it
there
was
neither
sun
nor
moon
these
things
she
noticed
but
more
than
all
she
saw
her
secret
friend
lying
crouched
upon
his
side
close
to
the
ditch
with
his
arms
about
his
face
she
saw
the
slow
leaves
fall
upon
him
from
the
ruined
trees
she
saw
the
damp
air
settle
in
beads
upon
his
clothes
his
feet
were
in
the
undergrowth
and
above
them
the
dripping
net
of
the
spider
was
flung
she
had
never
seen
her
friend
quite
still
before
all
her
life
her
secret
friend
and
her
secret
sea
had
kept
her
soul
awake
with
movement
but
her
friend
was
dead
and
there
was
no
more
sea
the
very
fine
rain
blew
across
her
secret
world
and
blotted
it
out
the
very
distant
sound
of
guns
which
was
not
so
much
a
sound
as
an
indescribable
vacuum
of
sound
shattered
the
walls
of
her
bubble
enchantment
oh
darling
jay
said
william
morgan
i
wish
i
could
help
you
i
ca
go
away
and
leave
you
like
this
i
wish
i
could
help
you
she
found
she
had
her
forehead
on
the
table
and
her
hands
were
knotted
in
her
lap
and
where
once
the
gate
to
the
house
had
been
there
was
only
london
now
no
more
would
the
drum
of
the
sea
beat
in
her
heart
there
was
nothing
left
but
the
throbbing
of
distant
trams
so
it
all
lies
she
said
quietly
there
really
is
a
thing
called
death
after
all
people
die
jay
darling
do
sobbed
morgan
for
god
sake
marry
me
and
i
comfort
you
i
wo
die
i
swear
i
wo
and
after
all
spring
there
no
real
death
in
the
spring
kew
ca
have
died
oh
what
the
use
of
these
eternal
seasons
said
jay
there
is
a
thing
called
death
and
death
has
no
romance
and
no
reason
the
rats
died
and
kew
died
and
the
secret
world
died
and
there
is
nothing
left
it
was
young
david
lord
of
sheep
and
cattle
pursued
his
fate
the
april
fields
among
singing
a
song
of
solitary
battle
a
loud
mad
song
for
he
was
very
young
vivid
the
air
and
something
more
than
vivid
tall
clouds
were
in
the
sky
and
something
more
the
light
horizon
of
the
spring
was
livid
with
a
steel
smile
that
showed
the
teeth
of
war
it
was
young
david
mocked
the
philistine
it
was
young
david
laughed
beside
the
river
there
came
his
mother
his
and
yours
and
mine
with
five
smooth
stones
and
dropped
them
in
his
quiver
you
never
saw
so
a
fairy
you
never
saw
such
very
april
eyes
she
sang
him
sorrow
song
to
make
him
wary
she
gave
him
five
smooth
stones
to
make
him
wise
the
first
stone
is
love
and
that
shall
fail
you
the
second
stone
is
hate
and
that
shall
fail
you
the
third
stone
is
knowledge
and
that
shall
fail
you
the
fourth
stone
is
prayer
and
that
shall
fail
you
the
fifth
stone
shall
not
fail
you
for
what
is
love
o
lovers
of
my
tribe
and
what
is
love
o
women
of
my
day
love
is
a
farthing
piece
a
bloody
bribe
pressed
in
the
palm
of
god
and
thrown
away
and
what
is
hate
o
fierce
and
unforgiving
and
what
shall
hate
achieve
when
all
is
said
a
silly
joke
that
can
not
reach
the
living
a
spitting
in
the
faces
of
the
dead
and
what
is
knowledge
o
young
men
who
tasted
the
reddest
fruit
on
that
forbidden
tree
knowledge
is
but
a
painful
effort
wasted
a
bitter
drowning
in
a
bitter
sea
and
what
is
prayer
o
waiters
for
the
answer
and
what
is
prayer
o
seekers
of
the
cause
prayer
is
the
weary
soul
of
herod
dancer
dancing
before
blind
kings
without
applause
the
fifth
stone
is
a
magic
stone
my
david
made
up
of
fear
and
failure
lies
and
loss
its
heart
is
lead
and
on
its
face
is
graved
a
crooked
cross
my
son
a
crooked
cross
it
has
no
dignity
to
lend
it
value
no
purity
alas
it
bears
a
stain
you
shall
not
give
it
gratitude
nor
shall
you
recall
it
all
your
days
except
with
pain
oh
bless
your
blindness
glory
in
your
groping
mock
at
your
betters
with
an
upward
chin
and
when
the
moment
has
gone
by
for
hoping
sling
your
fifth
stone
o
son
of
mine
and
win
grief
do
i
give
you
grief
and
dreadful
laughter
sackcloth
for
banner
ashes
in
your
wine
go
forth
go
forth
nor
ask
me
what
comes
after
the
fifth
stone
shall
not
fail
you
son
of
mine
go
forth
go
forth
and
slay
the
philistine
there
were
a
few
very
warm
days
and
nights
in
the
west
last
spring
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
full
moon
there
were
so
few
clouds
in
the
sky
that
when
the
sun
went
down
it
found
no
canvas
on
which
to
paint
its
picture
so
it
went
down
unpictured
into
a
bank
of
grey
heat
that
hid
the
horizon
of
the
sea
and
no
one
thought
it
worth
watching
except
a
man
coming
alone
along
the
cliff
from
the
northeast
the
moon
came
up
and
filled
the
quarry
with
ghosts
and
with
confused
and
blinded
memories
the
sea
advanced
in
armies
of
great
smooth
waves
but
under
the
moon
the
wind
went
down
and
the
waves
went
down
and
there
was
less
and
less
sound
in
the
air
one
man
watched
the
dwindling
waves
troop
into
the
cove
near
the
quarry
there
was
only
one
pair
of
eyes
in
the
whole
world
that
tried
that
night
to
trace
in
the
air
the
shape
of
a
drowned
house
there
was
only
one
shadow
by
the
quarry
for
the
moon
to
cast
upon
the
thyme
there
was
no
voice
but
the
voice
of
the
sea
no
passing
but
the
peaceful
passing
of
the
lambs
disturbed
the
thistles
and
the
foxgloves
the
sea
rose
like
a
wall
across
the
night
a
wall
that
shut
half
of
life
away
the
sky
fell
like
a
curtain
on
the
land
but
there
was
no
piece
to
be
played
so
the
curtain
was
never
raised
one
man
waited
all
the
night
through
like
a
child
waiting
for
the
fairies
the
sea
grew
calmer
and
calmer
the
tide
went
down
and
the
cove
spread
out
its
long
sands
like
fingers
into
the
sea
there
was
a
shadow
on
the
sands
below
the
quarry
and
it
may
have
been
the
shadow
of
a
house
and
perhaps
when
the
tide
came
up
at
dawn
it
devoured
old
footprints
upon
the
shore
the
prints
of
feet
that
will
never
come
back
i
think
that
when
the
moon
fled
away
into
oblivion
it
was
not
only
the
moon
that
fled
but
also
a
bubble
world
full
of
dead
secrets
how
foolish
to
wait
for
the
culmination
of
a
secret
story
how
foolish
of
a
man
to
wait
all
night
for
the
redemption
of
an
old
promise
for
the
resurrection
of
a
forgotten
romance
there
are
no
secret
stories
there
is
no
secret
world
there
are
no
secret
friends
the
house
by
the
sea
has
been
drowned
and
even
its
ghosts
have
forgotten
it
after
all
there
was
nothing
to
remember
the
gate
to
the
house
is
barred
not
by
a
lock
but
by
a
laugh
reality
and
not
adversity
has
blown
the
bubble
away
i
remember
the
moment
when
jay
found
of
her
life
proved
false
i
remember
that
she
besieged
the
world
with
tears
i
remember
that
she
bruised
her
hands
against
the
iron
gate
how
foolish
to
bruise
hands
against
nothingness
it
is
well
sighed
anonyma
that
our
little
jay
has
at
last
found
romance
since
first
she
came
to
my
arms
a
toddling
sceptic
of
four
i
have
seen
what
she
lacked
i
have
prayed
that
i
who
possessed
it
might
perhaps
be
inspired
to
give
her
the
clue
yet
to
young
bill
morgan
it
was
given
to
show
her
the
way
to
unlock
the
door
oh
russ
we
grow
older
and
wiser
and
are
left
behind
the
young
reap
where
we
have
sown
is
this
always
to
be
the
end
of
our
youth
russell
laughed
a
little
yes
he
said
this
is
the
end
the
finest
fruit
god
ever
made
hangs
from
the
tree
of
heaven
blue
it
hangs
above
the
steel
sea
blade
that
cuts
the
world
great
globe
in
two
the
keenest
eye
that
ever
saw
stares
out
of
heaven
into
mine
spins
out
my
heart
and
seems
to
draw
my
soul
elastic
very
fine
the
greatest
beacon
ever
fired
stands
up
on
heaven
hill
to
show
the
limit
of
the
thing
desired
beyond
which
man
may
never
go
at
midnight
when
the
night
did
dance
along
the
hours
that
led
to
morning
i
saw
a
little
boat
advance
towards
the
great
moon
beacon
warning
the
moon
god
slave
who
lights
the
torch
lest
men
should
slip
between
the
bars
and
run
aground
on
and
scorch
to
death
upon
a
bank
of
stars
the
little
boat
on
leaning
keel
sang
up
the
mountains
of
the
sea
bearing
a
man
who
hoped
to
steal
god
slave
from
out
eternity
my
love
i
see
you
through
my
tears
no
pity
in
your
face
i
see
i
have
sailed
far
across
the
years
stretch
out
stretch
out
your
arms
to
me
my
love
i
have
an
island
seen
so
shadowed
god
most
piercing
star
shall
never
see
where
we
have
been
shall
never
whisper
where
we
are
there
we
will
wander
you
and
i
down
guilty
and
delightful
ways
while
plait
their
fingers
high
against
your
god
enormous
gaze
for
oh
the
joy
of
two
and
two
your
paradise
shall
never
see
the
ecstasy
of
me
and
you
the
white
delight
of
you
and
me
i
know
the
penalty
the
clutch
of
god
great
rocks
upon
my
keel
drowned
in
the
ocean
of
too
much
so
ends
your
thief
yet
let
me
steal
the
slave
of
god
she
froze
her
face
the
slave
of
god
she
paid
no
heed
and
down
high
heaven
space
loud
angels
mocked
the
sailor
greed
the
diamond
sun
arose
and
tossed
a
billion
gems
across
the
sea
the
slave
of
god
is
lost
is
lost
the
slave
of
god
is
lost
to
me
he
grounded
on
the
common
beach
he
trod
the
little
towns
of
men
and
god
removed
from
his
reach
the
cup
of
heaven
passion
then
and
gave
him
vulgar
love
and
speech
and
gave
him
threescore
years
and
ten
