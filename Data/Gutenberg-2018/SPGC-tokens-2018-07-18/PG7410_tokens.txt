i
on
their
way
back
to
the
where
they
were
boarding
wife
reproached
him
for
what
she
called
his
recklessness
you
had
no
right
she
said
to
give
the
poor
boy
false
hopes
you
ought
to
have
discouraged
him
that
would
have
been
the
most
merciful
way
if
you
knew
the
poetry
was
bad
now
he
will
go
on
building
all
sorts
of
castles
in
the
air
on
your
praise
and
sooner
or
later
they
will
come
tumbling
about
his
ears
just
to
gratify
your
passion
for
saying
pleasant
things
to
i
wish
you
had
a
passion
for
saying
pleasant
things
to
me
my
dear
suggested
her
husband
evasively
oh
a
nice
time
i
should
have
i
do
know
about
nice
time
but
i
feel
pretty
certain
of
my
own
how
do
you
know
oh
get
up
you
implacable
cripple
he
broke
off
to
the
lame
mare
he
was
driving
and
pulled
at
the
reins
do
saw
her
mouth
cried
sewell
well
let
her
get
up
then
and
i
wo
i
do
like
to
saw
her
mouth
but
i
have
to
do
something
when
you
come
down
on
me
with
your
interminable
consequences
i
dare
say
the
boy
will
never
think
of
my
praise
again
and
besides
as
i
was
saying
when
this
animal
interrupted
me
with
her
attempts
at
grazing
how
do
you
know
that
i
knew
the
poetry
was
bad
how
by
the
sound
of
your
voice
i
could
tell
you
were
dishonest
in
the
dark
perhaps
the
boy
knew
that
i
was
dishonest
too
suggested
sewell
oh
no
he
did
i
could
see
that
he
pinned
his
faith
to
every
he
used
a
quantity
of
pins
then
for
i
was
particularly
profuse
of
syllables
i
find
that
it
requires
no
end
of
them
to
make
the
worse
appear
the
better
reason
to
a
poet
who
reads
his
own
verses
to
you
but
come
now
lucy
let
me
off
a
syllable
or
two
i
i
have
a
conscience
you
know
well
enough
and
if
i
thought
but
pshaw
i
merely
cheered
a
lonely
hour
for
the
boy
and
he
go
back
to
hoeing
potatoes
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
i
that
will
be
the
end
of
it
said
sewell
with
the
darkling
reserve
of
ladies
intimate
with
the
designs
of
providence
well
argued
her
husband
who
was
trying
to
keep
the
matter
from
being
serious
perhaps
he
may
turn
out
a
poet
yet
you
never
can
tell
where
the
lightning
is
going
to
strike
he
has
some
idea
of
rhyme
and
some
perception
of
reason
and
yes
some
of
the
lines
musical
his
general
attitude
reminded
me
of
piers
plowman
did
he
recall
piers
plowman
to
you
i
glad
you
can
console
yourself
in
that
way
david
said
his
wife
relentlessly
the
mare
stopped
again
and
sewell
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
house
now
black
in
the
twilight
on
the
crest
of
the
low
hill
across
the
hollow
behind
them
i
declare
he
said
the
loneliness
of
that
place
almost
broke
my
heart
there
he
added
as
the
faint
sickle
gleamed
in
the
sky
above
the
roof
i
got
the
new
moon
right
over
my
left
shoulder
for
my
pains
that
what
comes
of
having
a
sympathetic
the
boy
was
looking
at
the
new
moon
across
the
broken
gate
which
stopped
the
largest
gap
in
the
tumbled
stone
wall
he
still
gripped
in
his
hand
the
manuscript
which
he
had
been
reading
to
the
minister
there
lem
called
his
mother
voice
from
the
house
i
guess
seen
the
last
of
for
one
while
i
you
take
cold
out
there
the
dew
come
in
the
boy
obeyed
i
was
looking
at
the
new
moon
mother
i
saw
it
over
my
right
shoulder
did
you
hear
hear
him
he
asked
in
a
broken
and
husky
voice
hear
how
he
praised
my
poetry
mother
oh
make
her
get
up
david
cried
sewell
these
mosquitoes
are
eating
me
alive
i
will
saw
her
mouth
all
to
the
finest
sort
of
if
she
does
get
up
this
very
instant
said
sewell
jerking
the
reins
so
wildly
that
the
mare
leaped
into
a
galvanic
canter
and
continued
without
further
urging
for
twenty
paces
of
course
lucy
he
resumed
profiting
by
the
opportunity
for
conversation
which
the
mare
temporary
activity
afforded
i
should
feel
myself
greatly
to
blame
if
i
thought
i
had
gone
beyond
mere
kindness
in
my
treatment
of
the
poor
fellow
but
at
first
i
could
realise
that
the
stuff
was
so
bad
their
saying
that
he
read
all
the
books
he
could
get
and
was
writing
every
spare
moment
gave
me
the
idea
that
he
be
some
sort
of
literary
genius
in
the
germ
and
i
listened
on
and
on
expecting
every
moment
that
he
was
coming
to
some
passage
with
a
little
lift
or
life
in
it
and
when
he
got
to
the
end
and
had
come
to
it
i
could
quite
pull
myself
together
to
say
so
i
had
gone
there
so
full
of
the
wish
to
recognise
and
encourage
that
i
could
turn
about
for
the
other
thing
well
i
shall
know
another
time
how
to
value
a
rural
neighbourhood
report
of
the
existence
of
a
local
poet
usually
there
is
some
hardheaded
cynic
in
the
community
with
native
perception
enough
to
enlighten
the
rest
as
to
the
true
value
of
the
phenomenon
but
there
seems
to
have
been
none
here
i
ought
to
have
come
sooner
to
see
him
and
then
i
could
have
had
a
chance
to
go
again
and
talk
soberly
and
kindly
with
him
and
show
him
gently
how
much
he
had
mistaken
himself
oh
up
by
this
time
the
mare
had
lapsed
again
into
her
habitual
and
was
limping
along
the
dark
road
with
a
tendency
to
come
to
a
full
stop
from
step
to
step
the
remorse
in
the
minister
soul
was
so
keen
that
he
could
not
use
her
with
the
cruelty
necessary
to
rouse
her
flagging
energies
as
he
held
the
reins
he
flapped
his
elbows
up
toward
his
face
as
if
they
were
wings
and
contrived
to
beat
away
a
few
of
the
mosquitoes
with
them
sewell
in
silent
exasperation
fought
them
from
her
with
the
bough
which
she
had
torn
from
an
overhanging
in
the
morning
they
returned
to
boston
and
sewell
parish
duties
began
again
he
was
rather
faithfuller
and
busier
in
these
than
he
might
have
been
if
he
had
not
laid
so
much
stress
upon
duties
of
all
sorts
and
so
little
upon
beliefs
he
declared
that
he
envied
the
ministers
of
the
good
old
times
who
had
only
to
teach
their
people
that
they
would
be
lost
if
they
did
not
do
right
it
was
much
simpler
than
to
make
them
understand
that
they
were
often
to
be
good
for
reasons
not
immediately
connected
with
their
present
or
future
comfort
and
that
they
could
not
confidently
expect
to
be
lost
for
any
given
transgression
or
even
to
be
lost
at
all
he
found
it
necessary
to
do
his
work
largely
in
a
personal
way
by
meeting
and
talking
with
people
and
this
took
up
a
great
deal
of
his
time
especially
after
the
summer
vacation
when
he
had
to
get
into
relations
with
them
anew
and
to
help
them
recover
themselves
from
the
moral
lassitude
into
which
people
fall
during
that
season
of
physical
recuperation
he
was
occupied
with
these
matters
one
morning
late
in
october
when
a
letter
came
addressed
in
a
handwriting
of
copybook
carefulness
but
showing
in
every
painstaking
stroke
the
writer
want
of
training
which
when
he
read
it
filled
sewell
with
dismay
it
was
a
letter
from
lemuel
barker
whom
sewell
remembered
with
a
pang
of
as
the
poor
fellow
he
had
visited
with
his
wife
the
evening
before
they
left
willoughby
pastures
and
it
enclosed
passages
of
a
long
poem
which
barker
said
he
had
written
since
he
got
the
fall
work
done
the
passages
were
not
submitted
for
sewell
criticism
but
were
offered
as
examples
of
the
character
of
the
whole
poem
for
which
the
author
wished
to
find
a
publisher
they
were
not
without
ideas
of
a
didactic
and
satirical
sort
but
they
seemed
so
wanting
in
literary
art
beyond
a
mechanical
facility
of
versification
that
sewell
wondered
how
the
writer
should
have
mastered
the
notion
of
anything
so
literary
as
publication
till
he
came
to
that
part
of
the
letter
in
which
barker
spoke
of
their
having
had
so
much
sickness
in
the
family
that
he
thought
he
would
try
to
do
something
to
help
along
the
avowal
of
this
meritorious
ambition
inflicted
another
wound
upon
sewell
guilty
consciousness
but
what
made
his
blood
run
cold
was
barker
proposal
to
come
down
to
boston
if
sewell
advised
and
find
a
publisher
with
sewell
assistance
this
would
never
do
and
the
minister
went
to
his
desk
with
the
intention
of
despatching
a
note
of
prompt
and
total
discouragement
but
in
crossing
the
room
from
the
chair
into
which
he
had
sunk
with
a
cheerful
curiosity
to
read
the
letter
he
could
not
help
some
natural
rebellion
against
the
punishment
visited
upon
him
he
could
not
deny
that
he
deserved
punishment
but
he
thought
that
this
to
say
the
least
was
very
he
had
often
warned
other
sinners
who
came
to
him
in
like
resentment
that
it
was
this
very
quality
of
inopportuneness
that
was
perhaps
the
most
sanative
and
divine
property
of
retribution
the
eternal
justice
fell
upon
us
he
said
at
the
very
moment
when
we
were
least
able
to
bear
it
or
thought
ourselves
so
but
now
in
his
own
case
the
prophet
cried
out
and
revolted
in
his
heart
it
was
saturday
morning
when
every
minute
was
precious
to
him
for
his
sermon
and
it
would
take
him
fully
an
hour
to
write
that
letter
it
must
be
done
with
the
greatest
sympathy
he
had
seen
that
this
poor
foolish
boy
was
very
sensitive
and
yet
it
must
be
done
with
such
thoroughness
as
to
cut
off
all
hope
of
anything
like
literary
achievement
for
him
at
the
moment
sewell
reached
his
desk
with
a
spirit
disciplined
to
the
sacrifice
required
of
it
he
heard
his
wife
step
outside
his
study
door
and
he
had
just
time
to
pull
open
a
drawer
throw
the
letter
into
it
and
shut
it
again
before
she
entered
he
did
not
mean
finally
to
conceal
it
from
her
but
he
was
willing
to
give
himself
breath
before
he
faced
her
with
the
fact
that
he
had
received
such
a
letter
nothing
in
its
way
was
more
terrible
to
this
good
man
than
the
righteousness
of
that
good
woman
in
their
case
as
in
that
of
most
other
couples
who
cherish
an
ideal
of
dutiful
living
she
was
the
custodian
of
their
potential
virtue
and
he
was
the
instrument
often
faltering
and
imperfect
of
its
application
to
circumstances
and
without
wishing
to
spare
himself
too
much
he
was
sometimes
aware
that
she
did
not
spare
him
enough
she
worked
his
moral
forces
as
mercilessly
as
a
woman
uses
the
physical
strength
of
a
man
when
it
is
placed
at
her
direction
what
is
the
matter
david
she
asked
with
a
keen
glance
at
the
face
he
turned
upon
her
over
his
shoulder
nothing
that
i
wish
to
talk
of
at
present
my
dear
answered
sewell
with
a
boldness
that
he
knew
would
not
avail
him
if
she
persisted
in
knowing
well
there
would
be
no
time
if
you
did
said
his
wife
dreadfully
sorry
for
you
david
but
it
really
a
case
you
refuse
their
own
minister
is
taken
sick
and
it
appointed
for
this
afternoon
at
two
and
the
poor
thing
has
set
her
heart
upon
having
you
and
you
must
go
in
fact
i
promised
you
would
i
see
that
you
not
disturbed
this
morning
so
that
you
have
the
whole
forenoon
to
yourself
but
i
thought
i
better
tell
you
at
once
only
a
child
a
little
boy
you
wo
have
to
say
oh
of
course
i
must
go
answered
sewell
with
impatient
resignation
and
when
his
wife
left
the
room
which
she
did
after
praising
him
and
pitying
him
in
a
way
that
was
always
very
sweet
to
him
he
saw
that
he
must
begin
his
sermon
at
once
if
he
meant
to
get
through
with
it
in
time
and
must
put
off
all
hope
of
replying
to
lemuel
barker
till
monday
at
least
but
he
chose
quite
a
different
theme
from
that
on
which
he
had
intended
to
preach
by
an
immediate
inspiration
he
wrote
a
sermon
on
the
text
the
tender
mercies
of
the
wicked
are
cruel
in
which
he
taught
how
great
harm
could
be
done
by
the
habit
of
saying
what
are
called
kind
things
he
showed
that
this
habit
arose
not
from
goodness
of
heart
or
from
the
desire
to
make
others
happy
but
from
the
wish
to
spare
the
troublesome
duty
of
formulating
the
truth
so
that
it
would
perform
its
heavenly
office
without
wounding
those
whom
it
was
intended
to
heal
he
warned
his
hearers
that
the
kind
things
spoken
from
this
motive
were
so
many
sins
committed
against
the
soul
of
the
flatterer
and
the
soul
of
him
they
were
intended
to
flatter
they
were
deceits
lies
and
he
besought
all
within
the
sound
of
his
voice
to
try
to
practise
with
one
another
an
affectionate
sincerity
which
was
compatible
not
only
with
the
brotherliness
of
christianity
but
the
politeness
of
the
world
he
enforced
his
points
with
many
apt
illustrations
and
he
treated
the
whole
subject
with
so
much
fulness
and
fervour
that
he
fell
into
the
error
of
the
literary
temperament
and
almost
felt
that
he
had
atoned
for
his
wrongdoing
by
the
force
with
which
he
had
portrayed
it
sewell
who
did
not
always
go
to
her
husband
sermons
was
at
church
that
day
and
joined
him
when
some
ladies
who
had
lingered
to
thank
him
for
the
excellent
lesson
he
had
given
them
at
last
left
him
to
her
really
david
she
said
i
wondered
your
congregation
could
keep
their
countenances
while
you
were
going
on
did
you
think
of
that
poor
boy
up
at
willoughby
pastures
when
you
were
writing
that
sermon
yes
my
dear
replied
sewell
gravely
he
was
in
my
mind
the
whole
well
you
were
rather
hard
upon
yourself
and
i
think
i
was
rather
too
hard
upon
you
that
time
though
i
was
so
vexed
with
you
but
nothing
has
come
of
it
and
i
suppose
there
are
cases
where
people
are
so
lost
to
common
sense
that
you
ca
do
anything
for
them
by
telling
them
the
but
you
better
tell
it
all
the
same
said
sewell
still
in
a
glow
of
righteous
warmth
from
his
atonement
and
now
a
sudden
temptation
to
play
with
fire
seized
him
you
would
have
excused
me
if
any
trouble
had
come
of
no
i
certainly
should
said
his
wife
but
i
do
regret
it
altogether
if
it
made
you
see
what
danger
you
run
from
that
tendency
of
yours
what
in
the
world
made
you
think
of
it
oh
it
came
into
my
said
sewell
he
did
not
find
time
to
write
to
barker
the
next
day
and
on
recurring
to
his
letter
he
saw
that
there
was
no
danger
of
his
taking
another
step
without
his
advice
and
he
began
to
postpone
it
when
he
had
time
he
was
not
in
the
mood
he
waited
for
the
time
and
the
mood
to
come
together
and
he
also
waited
for
the
most
favourable
moment
to
tell
his
wife
that
he
had
got
that
letter
from
barker
and
to
ask
her
advice
about
answering
it
if
it
had
been
really
a
serious
matter
he
would
have
told
her
at
once
but
being
the
thing
it
was
he
did
not
know
just
how
to
approach
it
after
his
first
concealment
he
knew
that
to
begin
with
he
would
have
to
account
for
his
mistake
in
attempting
to
keep
it
from
her
and
would
have
to
bear
some
just
upbraiding
for
this
unmanly
course
and
would
then
be
miserably
led
to
the
distasteful
contemplation
of
the
folly
by
which
he
had
brought
this
trouble
upon
himself
sewell
smiled
to
think
how
much
easier
it
was
to
make
one
peace
with
one
god
than
with
one
wife
and
before
he
had
brought
himself
to
the
point
of
answering
barker
letter
there
came
a
busy
season
in
which
he
forgot
him
altogether
ii
one
day
in
the
midst
of
this
sewell
was
called
from
his
study
to
see
some
one
who
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
but
who
sent
in
no
name
by
the
housemaid
i
do
know
as
you
remember
me
the
visitor
said
rising
awkwardly
as
sewell
came
forward
with
a
smile
of
inquiry
my
name
barker
said
the
minister
with
a
cold
thrill
of
instant
recognition
but
playing
with
a
factitious
uncertainty
till
he
could
catch
his
breath
in
the
presence
of
the
calamity
oh
yes
how
do
you
do
he
said
and
then
planting
himself
adventurously
upon
the
commandment
to
love
neighbour
as
he
added
i
very
glad
to
see
you
in
token
of
his
content
he
gave
barker
his
hand
and
asked
him
to
be
seated
the
young
man
complied
and
while
sewell
waited
for
him
to
present
himself
in
some
shape
that
he
could
grapple
with
morally
he
made
an
involuntary
study
of
his
personal
appearance
that
morning
before
starting
from
home
by
the
that
left
willoughby
pastures
at
barker
had
given
his
sunday
boots
a
coat
of
blacking
which
he
had
eked
out
with
and
he
had
put
on
his
best
pantaloons
which
he
had
outgrown
and
which
having
been
made
very
tight
a
season
after
tight
pantaloons
had
gone
out
of
fashion
in
boston
caught
on
the
tops
of
his
boots
and
stuck
there
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
kick
them
loose
as
he
stood
up
and
his
secret
attempts
to
smooth
them
down
when
he
had
reseated
himself
he
wore
a
coat
of
cheap
broadcloth
fastened
across
his
chest
with
a
carnelian
of
his
father
such
as
country
youth
wore
thirty
years
ago
and
a
belated
summer
scarf
of
gingham
tied
in
a
breadth
of
knot
long
since
abandoned
by
polite
society
sewell
had
never
thought
his
wife
very
splendidly
appointed
but
barker
must
have
been
oppressed
by
it
for
he
sat
in
absolute
silence
after
resuming
his
chair
and
made
no
sign
of
intending
to
open
the
matter
upon
which
he
came
in
the
kindness
of
his
heart
sewell
could
not
refrain
from
helping
him
on
when
did
you
come
to
boston
he
asked
with
a
cheeriness
which
he
was
far
from
feeling
this
morning
said
barker
briefly
but
without
the
tremor
in
his
voice
which
sewell
expected
you
never
been
here
before
i
suppose
suggested
sewell
with
the
vague
intention
of
generalising
or
particularising
the
conversation
as
the
case
might
be
barker
abruptly
rejected
the
overture
whatever
it
was
i
do
know
as
you
got
a
letter
from
me
a
spell
back
he
said
yes
i
did
confessed
sewell
i
did
receive
that
letter
he
repeated
and
i
ought
to
have
answered
it
long
ago
but
the
fact
is
he
corrected
himself
when
it
came
to
his
saying
this
and
said
i
mean
that
i
put
it
by
intending
to
answer
it
when
i
could
do
so
in
the
proper
way
until
i
very
sorry
to
say
i
forgot
it
altogether
yes
i
forgot
it
and
i
certainly
ask
your
pardon
for
my
neglect
but
i
say
that
as
it
turned
out
i
altogether
regret
it
i
can
talk
with
you
a
great
deal
better
than
i
could
write
to
you
in
regard
to
your
sewell
hesitated
between
the
words
poems
and
verses
and
finally
said
work
i
have
blamed
myself
a
great
deal
he
continued
wincing
under
the
hurt
which
he
felt
that
he
must
be
inflicting
on
the
young
man
as
well
as
himself
for
not
being
more
frank
with
you
when
i
saw
you
at
home
in
september
i
hope
your
mother
is
well
she
middling
said
barker
but
my
married
sister
that
came
to
live
with
us
since
you
was
there
has
had
a
good
deal
of
sickness
in
her
family
her
husband
laid
up
with
the
rheumatism
most
of
the
oh
murmured
sewell
sympathetically
well
i
ought
to
have
told
you
at
that
time
that
i
could
not
see
much
hope
of
your
doing
acceptable
work
in
a
literary
way
and
if
i
had
supposed
that
you
ever
expected
to
exercise
your
faculty
of
versifying
to
any
serious
purpose
for
anything
but
your
own
pleasure
and
entertainment
i
should
certainly
have
done
so
and
i
tell
you
now
that
the
specimens
of
the
long
poem
you
have
sent
me
give
me
even
less
reason
to
encourage
you
than
the
things
you
read
me
at
sewell
expected
the
audible
crash
of
barker
to
break
the
silence
which
the
young
man
suffered
to
follow
upon
these
words
but
nothing
of
the
kind
happened
and
for
all
that
he
could
see
barker
remained
wholly
unaffected
by
what
he
had
said
it
nettled
sewell
a
little
to
see
him
apparently
so
besotted
in
his
own
conceit
and
he
added
but
i
think
i
had
better
not
ask
you
to
rely
altogether
upon
my
opinion
in
the
matter
and
i
will
go
with
you
to
a
publisher
and
you
can
get
a
professional
judgment
excuse
me
a
he
left
the
room
and
went
slowly
upstairs
to
his
wife
it
appeared
to
him
a
very
short
journey
to
the
third
story
where
he
knew
she
was
decking
the
for
the
visit
of
a
friend
whom
they
expected
that
evening
he
imagined
himself
saying
to
her
when
his
trial
was
well
over
that
he
did
not
see
why
she
complained
of
those
stairs
that
he
thought
they
were
nothing
at
all
but
this
sense
of
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
which
played
upon
the
surface
of
his
distress
flickered
and
fled
at
sight
of
his
wife
bustling
cheerfully
about
and
he
was
tempted
to
go
down
and
get
barker
out
of
the
house
and
out
of
boston
if
possible
without
letting
her
know
anything
of
his
presence
well
said
sewell
meeting
his
face
of
perplexity
with
a
penetrating
glance
what
is
it
david
nothing
that
is
everything
lemuel
barker
is
here
lemuel
barker
who
is
lemuel
barker
she
stood
with
the
in
her
hand
which
she
was
just
about
to
fasten
on
the
pillow
and
sewell
involuntarily
took
note
of
the
fashion
in
which
it
was
ironed
why
surely
you
remember
that
simpleton
at
willoughby
if
his
wife
had
dropped
the
and
sunk
into
a
chair
beside
the
bed
fixing
him
with
eyes
of
speechless
reproach
if
she
had
done
anything
dramatic
or
said
anything
tragic
no
matter
how
unjust
or
exaggerated
sewell
could
have
borne
it
but
she
only
went
on
tying
the
sham
on
the
pillow
without
a
word
the
fact
is
he
wrote
to
me
some
weeks
ago
and
sent
me
some
specimens
of
a
long
just
before
you
preached
that
sermon
on
the
tender
mercies
of
the
wicked
yes
faltered
sewell
i
had
been
waiting
to
show
you
the
you
waited
a
good
while
i
know
i
know
said
sewell
miserably
i
was
waiting
waiting
he
stopped
and
then
added
with
a
burst
i
was
waiting
till
i
could
put
it
to
you
in
some
favourable
i
glad
you
honest
about
it
at
last
my
dear
yes
and
while
i
was
waiting
i
forgot
barker
letter
altogether
i
put
it
away
somewhere
i
ca
recollect
just
where
at
the
moment
but
that
makes
no
difference
he
here
with
the
whole
poem
in
his
pocket
sewell
gained
a
little
courage
from
his
wife
forbearance
she
knew
that
she
could
trust
him
in
all
great
matters
and
perhaps
she
thought
that
for
this
little
sin
she
would
not
add
to
his
punishment
and
what
i
propose
to
do
is
to
make
a
complete
thing
of
it
this
time
of
course
he
went
on
convicting
himself
i
see
that
i
shall
inflict
twice
the
pain
that
i
should
have
done
if
i
had
spoken
frankly
to
him
at
first
and
of
course
there
will
be
the
added
disappointment
and
the
expense
of
his
coming
to
boston
but
he
added
brightly
we
can
save
him
any
expense
while
he
here
and
perhaps
i
can
contrive
to
get
him
to
go
home
this
he
would
let
you
pay
for
his
dinner
out
of
the
house
anywhere
said
sewell
you
must
ask
him
to
dinner
well
said
sewell
with
resignation
and
suspecting
that
his
wife
was
too
much
piqued
or
hurt
by
his
former
concealment
to
ask
what
he
now
meant
to
do
about
barker
he
added
i
going
to
take
him
round
to
a
publisher
and
let
him
convince
himself
that
there
no
hope
for
him
in
a
literary
david
cried
his
wife
and
now
she
left
off
adjusting
the
shams
and
erecting
herself
looked
at
him
across
the
bed
you
do
intend
to
do
anything
so
cruel
yes
why
should
you
go
and
waste
any
publisher
time
by
getting
him
to
look
at
such
rubbish
why
should
you
expose
the
poor
fellow
to
the
mortification
of
a
perfectly
needless
refusal
do
you
want
to
shirk
the
responsibility
to
put
it
on
some
one
else
no
you
know
i
well
then
tell
him
yourself
that
it
wo
i
have
told
what
does
he
say
he
does
say
anything
i
ca
make
out
whether
he
believes
me
or
very
well
then
you
done
your
duty
at
any
sewell
could
not
forbear
saying
also
if
you
done
it
at
first
david
there
would
have
been
any
of
this
that
true
owned
her
husband
so
very
humbly
that
her
heart
smote
her
well
go
down
and
tell
him
he
must
stay
to
dinner
and
then
try
to
get
rid
of
him
the
best
way
you
can
your
time
is
really
too
precious
david
to
be
wasted
in
this
way
you
get
rid
of
him
sewell
went
back
to
his
guest
in
the
who
seemed
to
have
remained
as
immovably
in
his
chair
as
if
he
had
been
a
sitting
statue
of
himself
he
did
not
move
when
sewell
entered
on
second
thoughts
said
the
minister
i
believe
i
will
not
ask
you
to
go
to
a
publisher
with
me
as
i
had
intended
it
would
expose
you
to
unnecessary
mortification
and
it
would
be
from
my
point
of
view
an
unjustifiable
intrusion
upon
very
busy
people
i
must
ask
you
to
take
my
word
for
it
that
no
publisher
would
bring
out
your
poem
and
it
never
would
pay
you
a
cent
if
he
the
boy
remained
silent
as
before
and
sewell
had
no
means
of
knowing
whether
it
was
from
silent
conviction
or
from
mulish
obstinacy
mrs
sewell
will
be
down
presently
she
wished
me
to
ask
you
to
stay
to
dinner
we
have
an
early
dinner
and
there
will
be
time
enough
after
that
for
you
to
look
about
the
i
should
like
to
put
you
out
said
barker
oh
not
at
all
returned
sewell
grateful
for
this
sign
of
animation
and
not
exigent
of
a
more
formal
acceptance
of
his
invitation
you
know
he
said
that
literature
is
a
trade
like
every
other
vocation
and
that
you
must
serve
an
apprenticeship
if
you
expect
to
excel
but
first
of
all
you
must
have
some
natural
aptitude
for
the
business
you
undertake
you
understand
asked
sewell
for
he
had
begun
to
doubt
whether
barker
understood
anything
he
seemed
so
much
more
stupid
than
he
had
at
home
his
faculties
were
apparently
sealed
up
and
he
had
lost
all
the
personal
picturesqueness
which
he
had
when
he
came
in
out
of
the
barn
at
his
mother
call
to
receive
sewell
yes
said
the
boy
i
do
mean
continued
sewell
that
i
would
have
you
continue
to
make
verses
whenever
you
have
the
leisure
for
it
i
think
on
the
contrary
that
it
will
give
a
grace
to
your
life
which
it
might
otherwise
lack
we
are
all
in
daily
danger
of
being
barbarised
by
the
sordid
details
of
life
the
constantly
recurring
little
duties
which
must
be
done
but
which
we
must
not
allow
to
become
the
whole
of
sewell
was
so
much
pleased
with
this
thought
when
it
had
taken
form
in
words
that
he
made
a
mental
note
of
it
for
future
use
we
must
put
a
border
of
pinks
around
the
as
emerson
would
say
or
else
the
is
no
better
than
a
field
of
perhaps
because
the
logic
of
this
figure
rang
a
little
false
sewell
hastened
to
add
but
there
are
many
ways
in
which
we
can
prevent
the
encroachment
of
those
little
duties
without
being
tempted
to
neglect
them
which
would
be
still
worse
i
have
thought
a
good
deal
about
the
condition
of
our
young
men
in
the
country
and
i
have
sympathised
with
them
in
what
seems
their
want
of
opportunity
their
lack
of
room
for
expansion
i
have
often
wished
that
i
could
do
something
for
them
help
them
in
their
doubts
and
misgivings
and
perhaps
find
some
way
out
of
the
trouble
for
them
i
regret
this
tendency
to
the
cities
of
the
young
men
from
the
country
i
am
sure
that
if
we
could
give
them
some
sort
of
social
and
intellectual
life
at
home
they
would
not
be
so
restless
and
sewell
felt
as
if
he
had
been
preaching
to
a
dead
wall
but
now
the
wall
opened
and
a
voice
came
out
of
it
saying
you
mean
something
to
occupy
their
minds
exactly
so
cried
sewell
something
to
occupy
their
minds
now
he
continued
with
a
hope
of
getting
into
some
sort
of
human
relations
with
his
guest
which
he
had
not
felt
before
why
should
a
young
man
on
a
farm
take
up
some
scientific
study
like
geology
for
instance
which
makes
every
inch
of
earth
vocal
every
rock
historic
and
the
waste
places
social
barker
looked
so
blankly
at
him
that
he
asked
again
you
understand
yes
said
barker
but
having
answered
sewell
personal
question
he
seemed
to
feel
himself
in
no
wise
concerned
with
the
general
inquiry
which
sewell
had
made
and
he
let
it
lie
where
sewell
had
let
it
drop
but
the
minister
was
so
well
pleased
with
the
fact
that
barker
had
understood
anything
of
what
he
had
said
that
he
was
content
to
let
the
notion
he
had
thrown
out
take
its
chance
of
future
effect
and
rising
said
briskly
come
upstairs
with
me
into
my
study
and
i
will
show
you
a
picture
of
agassiz
it
a
very
good
he
led
the
way
out
of
the
and
tripped
lightly
in
his
slippered
feet
up
the
steps
against
which
barker
knocked
the
toes
of
his
clumsy
boots
he
was
not
large
nor
naturally
loutish
but
the
heaviness
of
the
country
was
in
every
touch
and
movement
he
dropped
the
photograph
twice
in
his
endeavour
to
hold
it
between
his
stiff
thumb
and
finger
sewell
picked
it
up
each
time
for
him
and
restored
it
to
his
faltering
hold
when
he
had
securely
lodged
it
there
he
asked
sweetly
did
you
ever
hear
what
agassiz
said
when
a
scheme
was
once
proposed
to
him
by
which
he
could
make
a
great
deal
of
money
i
do
know
as
i
did
replied
barker
gentlemen
no
time
to
make
barker
received
the
anecdote
in
absolute
silence
standing
helplessly
with
the
photograph
in
his
hand
and
sewell
with
a
hasty
sigh
forbore
to
make
the
application
to
the
ordinary
american
ambition
to
be
rich
that
he
had
intended
that
a
photograph
of
the
singer
nilsson
he
said
cataloguing
the
other
objects
on
the
she
was
a
peasant
you
know
a
country
girl
in
norway
that
grévy
the
president
of
the
french
republic
his
father
was
a
peasant
lincoln
of
course
sforza
throwing
his
hoe
into
the
oak
he
said
explaining
the
picture
that
had
caught
barker
eye
on
the
wall
above
the
mantel
he
was
working
in
the
field
when
a
band
of
adventurers
came
by
and
he
tossed
his
hoe
at
the
tree
if
it
fell
to
the
ground
he
would
keep
on
hoeing
if
it
caught
in
the
branches
and
hung
there
he
would
follow
the
adventurers
it
caught
and
he
went
with
the
soldiers
and
became
duke
of
milan
i
like
to
keep
the
pictures
of
these
great
originals
about
me
said
sewell
because
in
our
time
when
we
refer
so
constantly
to
law
we
are
apt
to
forget
that
god
is
creative
as
well
as
he
used
these
phrases
involuntarily
they
slipped
from
his
tongue
because
he
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
this
about
these
pictures
and
he
made
no
effort
to
adapt
them
to
barker
comprehension
because
he
could
not
see
that
the
idea
would
be
of
any
use
to
him
he
went
on
pointing
out
the
different
objects
in
the
quiet
room
and
he
took
down
several
books
from
the
shelves
that
covered
the
whole
wall
and
showed
them
to
barker
who
however
made
no
effort
to
look
at
them
for
himself
and
did
not
say
anything
about
them
he
did
what
sewell
bade
him
do
in
admiring
this
thing
or
that
but
if
he
had
been
an
indian
he
could
not
have
regarded
them
with
a
greater
reticence
sewell
made
him
sit
down
from
time
to
time
but
in
a
sitting
posture
barker
silence
became
so
deathlike
that
sewell
hastened
to
get
him
on
his
legs
again
and
to
walk
him
about
from
one
point
to
another
as
if
to
keep
life
in
him
at
the
end
of
one
of
these
otherwise
aimless
excursions
sewell
appeared
and
infused
a
gleam
of
hope
into
her
husband
breast
apparently
she
brought
none
to
barker
or
perhaps
he
did
not
conceive
it
polite
to
show
any
sort
of
liveliness
before
a
lady
he
did
what
he
could
with
the
hand
she
gave
him
to
shake
and
answered
the
brief
questions
she
put
to
him
about
his
family
to
precisely
the
same
effect
as
he
had
already
reported
its
condition
to
sewell
dinner
ready
now
said
sewell
for
all
comment
she
left
the
expansiveness
of
sympathy
and
gratulation
to
her
husband
on
most
occasions
and
on
this
she
felt
that
she
had
less
than
the
usual
obligation
to
make
polite
conversation
her
two
children
came
downstairs
after
her
and
as
she
unfolded
her
napkin
across
her
lap
after
grace
she
said
this
is
my
son
alfred
barker
and
this
is
barker
took
the
acquaintance
offered
in
silence
the
young
sewells
smiled
with
the
wise
kindliness
of
children
taught
to
be
good
to
all
manner
of
strange
guests
and
the
girl
cumbered
the
helpless
country
boy
with
offers
of
different
dishes
sewell
as
he
cut
at
the
roast
beef
lengthwise
being
denied
by
his
wife
a
pantomimic
prayer
to
be
allowed
to
cut
it
crosswise
tried
to
make
talk
with
barker
about
the
weather
at
willoughby
pastures
it
had
been
a
very
dry
summer
and
he
asked
if
the
fall
rains
had
filled
up
the
springs
he
said
he
really
forgot
whether
it
was
an
apple
year
he
also
said
that
he
supposed
they
had
dug
all
their
turnips
by
this
time
he
had
meant
to
say
potatoes
when
he
began
but
he
remembered
that
he
had
seen
the
farmers
digging
their
potatoes
before
he
came
back
to
town
and
so
he
substituted
turnips
afterwards
it
seemed
to
him
that
dig
was
not
just
the
word
to
use
in
regard
to
the
harvesting
of
turnips
he
wished
he
had
said
got
your
turnips
in
but
it
appeared
to
make
no
difference
to
barker
who
answered
yes
sir
and
no
sir
and
yes
sir
and
let
each
subject
drop
with
that
iii
the
silence
grew
so
deep
that
the
young
sewells
talked
together
in
murmurs
and
the
clicking
of
the
knives
on
the
plates
became
painful
sewell
kept
himself
from
looking
at
barker
whom
he
nevertheless
knew
to
be
changing
his
knife
and
fork
from
one
hand
to
the
other
as
doubt
after
doubt
took
him
as
to
their
conventional
use
and
to
be
getting
very
little
good
of
his
dinner
in
the
process
of
settling
these
questions
the
rang
and
the
sound
of
a
whispered
conference
between
the
visitor
and
the
servant
at
the
threshold
penetrated
to
the
some
one
softly
entered
and
then
sewell
called
out
yes
yes
come
in
come
in
miss
vane
she
jumped
from
her
chair
and
ran
out
into
the
hall
where
she
was
heard
to
kiss
her
visitor
she
reappeared
still
holding
her
by
the
hand
and
then
miss
vane
shook
hands
with
sewell
saying
in
a
tone
of
cordial
liking
d
do
and
to
each
of
the
young
people
as
she
shook
hands
in
turn
with
them
how
d
dear
she
was
no
longer
so
pretty
as
she
must
have
once
been
but
an
air
of
distinction
and
a
delicate
charm
of
manner
remained
to
her
from
her
fascinating
youth
young
sewell
pushed
her
a
chair
to
the
table
and
she
dropped
softly
into
it
after
acknowledging
barker
presentation
by
sewell
with
a
kindly
glance
that
probably
divined
him
you
must
dine
with
us
said
sewell
you
can
call
it
no
i
ca
sewell
said
miss
vane
i
could
once
and
should
have
said
with
great
pleasure
when
i
went
away
that
i
had
been
lunching
at
the
sewells
but
i
ca
now
i
reformed
what
have
you
got
for
dinner
roast
beef
said
sewell
nothing
i
dislike
more
replied
miss
vane
what
else
she
put
on
her
glasses
and
peered
critically
about
the
table
stewed
tomatoes
baked
sweet
potatoes
how
unimaginative
what
are
you
going
to
have
afterwards
cottage
the
very
climax
of
the
commonplace
well
miss
vane
began
to
pull
off
her
gloves
and
threw
her
veil
back
over
her
shoulder
i
will
dine
with
you
but
when
i
say
dine
and
people
ask
me
to
explain
i
shall
have
to
say
the
sewells
still
dine
at
one
you
know
and
laugh
over
your
habits
with
them
i
should
like
to
do
differently
and
to
respect
the
sacredness
of
broken
bread
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
trying
to
practise
with
every
one
an
affectionate
sincerity
which
is
perfectly
compatible
not
only
with
the
brotherliness
of
christianity
but
the
politeness
of
the
miss
vane
looked
demurely
at
sewell
i
ca
make
any
the
ladies
both
broke
into
a
mocking
laugh
in
which
sewell
joined
with
sheepish
reluctance
after
all
one
does
not
like
to
be
derided
even
by
one
dearest
friends
as
soon
as
i
hear
my
other
little
sins
denounced
from
the
pulpit
going
to
stop
using
profane
language
and
carrying
away
people
spoons
in
my
the
ladies
seemed
to
think
this
also
a
very
good
joke
and
his
children
laughed
in
sympathy
but
sewell
hung
his
head
barker
sat
bolt
upright
behind
his
plate
and
stared
at
miss
vane
i
never
have
been
all
but
named
in
church
before
she
concluded
and
i
heard
others
say
the
why
did
you
come
to
complain
sooner
asked
sewell
well
i
have
been
away
ever
since
that
occasion
i
went
down
the
next
day
to
newport
and
i
been
there
ever
since
admiring
the
on
the
lawns
or
on
the
ladies
asked
sewell
both
and
sowing
broadcast
the
seeds
of
plain
speaking
i
do
know
what
newport
will
be
in
another
year
if
they
all
take
i
dare
say
it
will
be
different
said
sewell
i
not
sure
it
will
be
he
plucked
up
a
little
spirit
and
added
now
you
see
of
how
little
importance
you
really
are
in
the
community
you
have
been
gone
these
three
weeks
and
your
own
pastor
did
know
you
were
out
of
yes
you
did
david
interposed
his
wife
i
told
you
miss
vane
was
away
two
weeks
did
you
well
i
forgot
it
immediately
the
fact
was
of
no
consequence
one
way
or
the
other
how
do
you
like
that
as
a
bit
of
affectionate
sincerity
i
like
it
immensely
said
miss
vane
it
delicious
i
only
wish
i
could
believe
you
were
she
leaned
back
and
laughed
into
her
handkerchief
while
sewell
regarded
her
with
a
face
in
which
his
mortification
at
being
laughed
at
was
giving
way
to
a
natural
pleasure
at
seeing
miss
vane
enjoy
herself
what
do
you
think
she
asked
since
you
in
this
mood
of
exasperated
veracity
or
pretend
to
be
of
the
flower
charity
do
you
mean
by
the
barrel
or
the
single
sack
the
graham
or
the
best
haxall
or
the
asked
sewell
miss
vane
lost
her
power
of
answering
in
another
peal
of
laughter
sobering
off
and
breaking
down
again
before
she
could
say
i
mean
cut
flowers
for
patients
and
oh
that
kind
i
do
think
a
single
pansy
would
have
an
appreciable
effect
upon
a
burglar
perhaps
a
bunch
of
might
or
a
few
lilies
of
the
valley
carelessly
arranged
as
to
the
influence
of
a
graceful
little
in
cases
of
rheumatism
or
cholera
morbus
it
might
be
efficacious
but
i
ca
really
how
perfectly
cynical
cried
miss
vane
do
you
know
how
much
good
the
flower
mission
has
accomplished
among
the
deserving
poor
hundreds
of
bouquets
are
distributed
every
day
they
prevent
that
shows
how
susceptible
the
deserving
poor
are
i
do
find
that
a
bowl
of
the
most
expensive
and
delicate
roses
in
the
centre
of
a
tempers
the
asperity
of
the
conversation
when
it
turns
upon
the
absent
but
perhaps
it
ought
to
do
i
do
know
about
that
said
miss
vane
but
if
you
had
an
impulsive
niece
to
supply
with
food
for
the
imagination
you
would
be
very
glad
of
anything
that
seemed
to
combine
practical
piety
and
picturesque
oh
if
you
mean
that
began
sewell
more
soberly
and
his
wife
leaned
forward
with
an
interest
in
the
question
which
she
had
not
felt
while
the
mere
joking
went
on
yes
when
sibyl
came
in
this
morning
with
an
imperative
demand
to
be
allowed
to
go
off
and
do
good
with
flowers
in
the
homes
of
virtuous
poverty
as
well
as
the
hospitals
and
prisons
i
certainly
felt
as
if
there
had
been
an
interposition
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
miss
vane
still
had
her
joking
air
but
a
note
of
anxiety
had
crept
into
her
voice
i
do
think
it
will
do
the
sick
and
poor
any
harm
said
sewell
and
it
may
do
sibyl
some
he
smiled
a
little
in
adding
it
may
afford
her
varied
energies
a
little
miss
vane
shook
her
head
and
some
lines
of
age
came
into
her
face
which
had
not
shown
themselves
there
before
and
you
would
advise
letting
her
go
into
it
she
asked
by
all
means
replied
sewell
but
if
she
going
to
engage
actively
in
the
missionary
work
i
think
you
better
go
with
her
on
her
errands
of
oh
of
course
she
going
to
do
good
in
person
what
she
wants
is
the
sensation
of
doing
good
of
seeing
and
hearing
the
results
of
her
beneficence
she
care
very
little
about
it
if
she
oh
i
do
know
that
you
can
say
that
replied
sewell
in
deprecation
of
this
extreme
view
i
do
believe
he
continued
that
she
would
object
to
doing
good
for
its
own
of
course
she
would
david
who
in
the
world
supposed
she
would
demanded
his
wife
bringing
him
up
roundly
at
this
sign
of
wandering
and
miss
vane
laughed
wildly
and
is
this
what
your
doctrine
of
sincerity
comes
to
this
fulsomeness
you
very
little
better
than
one
of
the
wicked
it
seems
to
me
well
i
that
you
would
approve
of
my
letting
sibyl
take
this
thing
up
but
such
encouragement
oh
i
do
wish
to
flatter
said
sewell
in
the
spirit
of
her
raillery
it
will
be
very
well
for
her
to
go
round
with
flowers
but
do
let
her
he
continued
seriously
do
let
her
imagine
it
more
than
an
innocent
amusement
it
would
be
a
sort
of
hideous
mockery
of
the
good
we
ought
to
do
one
another
if
there
were
supposed
to
be
anything
more
than
a
kindly
thoughtfulness
expressed
in
such
a
oh
if
sibyl
does
feel
that
it
real
for
the
time
being
she
care
anything
about
it
she
likes
to
lose
herself
in
the
illusion
she
well
said
sewell
with
a
slight
shrug
then
we
must
let
her
get
what
good
she
can
out
of
it
as
an
exercise
of
the
o
my
dear
exclaimed
his
wife
you
mean
anything
so
abominable
as
that
i
heard
you
say
that
the
worst
thing
about
fiction
and
the
theatre
was
that
they
brought
emotions
into
play
that
ought
to
be
sacred
to
real
did
i
say
that
well
i
must
have
been
right
i
barker
made
a
scuffling
sound
with
his
boots
under
the
table
and
rose
to
his
feet
i
guess
he
said
i
shall
have
to
be
they
had
all
forgotten
him
and
sewell
felt
as
if
he
had
neglected
this
helpless
guest
why
no
you
must
go
i
was
in
hopes
we
might
do
something
to
make
the
day
pleasant
to
you
i
intended
proposing
yes
his
wife
interrupted
believing
that
he
meant
to
give
up
one
of
his
precious
afternoons
to
barker
and
hastening
to
prevent
the
sacrifice
my
son
will
show
you
the
public
garden
and
the
common
and
go
about
the
town
with
she
rose
too
and
young
sewell
accustomed
to
suffer
silently
acquiesced
if
your
train
is
to
start
very
soon
i
guess
i
better
be
going
said
barker
and
sewell
now
gave
her
husband
a
look
conveying
her
belief
that
barker
would
be
happier
if
they
let
him
go
at
the
same
time
she
frowned
upon
the
monstrous
thought
of
asking
him
to
stay
the
night
with
them
which
she
detected
in
face
she
allowed
him
to
say
nothing
but
i
sorry
but
if
you
really
must
i
guess
i
better
persisted
barker
he
got
himself
somehow
to
the
door
where
he
paused
a
moment
and
contrived
to
pant
well
good
day
and
without
effort
at
more
cordial
passed
out
sewell
followed
him
and
helped
him
find
his
hat
and
made
him
shake
hands
he
went
with
him
to
the
door
and
beginning
to
suffer
afresh
at
the
wrong
he
had
done
barker
he
detained
him
at
the
threshold
if
you
still
wish
to
see
a
publisher
barker
i
will
gladly
go
with
oh
not
at
all
not
at
all
i
guess
i
do
want
to
see
any
publisher
this
afternoon
well
good
afternoon
he
turned
away
from
remorseful
pursuit
and
clumsily
hurrying
down
the
steps
he
walked
up
the
street
and
round
the
next
corner
sewell
stood
watching
him
in
rueful
perplexity
shading
his
eyes
from
the
mild
october
sun
with
his
hand
and
some
moments
after
barker
had
disappeared
he
remained
looking
after
him
when
he
rejoined
the
ladies
in
the
they
fell
into
a
conscious
silence
have
you
been
telling
lucy
he
asked
yes
i
been
telling
david
it
was
the
only
way
did
you
offer
to
go
with
him
to
a
publisher
again
yes
i
did
it
was
the
only
way
said
sewell
miss
vane
and
his
wife
both
broke
into
a
cry
of
laughter
the
former
got
her
breath
first
so
was
the
origin
of
the
famous
sermon
that
turned
all
our
heads
grey
with
good
sewell
assented
with
a
sickly
grin
what
in
the
world
you
encourage
him
my
goodness
of
heart
which
i
did
take
the
precaution
of
mixing
with
goodness
of
head
before
i
used
everything
was
food
for
miss
vane
laugh
even
this
confession
but
what
is
the
natural
history
of
the
boy
how
came
he
to
write
poetry
what
do
you
suppose
he
means
by
it
that
is
so
easy
to
say
as
to
his
natural
history
he
lives
with
his
mother
in
a
tumbledown
unpainted
wooden
house
in
the
deepest
fastness
of
willoughby
pastures
lucy
and
i
used
to
drive
by
it
and
wonder
what
kind
of
people
inhabited
that
solitude
there
were
scattered
round
the
and
the
monday
we
were
there
a
wash
flapped
across
it
the
thought
of
the
place
preyed
upon
me
till
one
day
i
asked
about
it
at
the
and
the
postmistress
told
me
that
the
boy
was
quite
a
literary
character
and
read
everything
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
and
up
nights
writing
poetry
it
seemed
to
me
a
very
clear
case
of
genius
and
the
postmistress
facts
rankled
in
my
mind
till
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
then
i
went
to
see
him
i
suppose
lucy
has
told
you
the
rest
yes
sewell
has
told
me
the
rest
but
still
i
do
see
how
he
came
to
write
poetry
i
believe
it
does
pay
even
in
extreme
cases
of
ah
but
that
just
what
this
poor
fellow
did
know
he
must
have
read
somewhere
in
some
deleterious
newspaper
about
the
sale
of
some
large
edition
of
a
poem
and
have
had
his
own
wild
hopes
about
it
i
do
say
his
work
did
show
sense
it
even
showed
some
rude
strength
of
a
didactic
satirical
sort
but
it
certainly
did
show
poetry
he
might
have
taken
up
painting
by
a
little
different
chance
and
when
it
was
once
known
about
the
neighbourhood
that
he
wrote
poetry
his
vanity
was
flattered
yes
i
see
but
was
there
any
kind
soul
to
tell
him
that
he
was
throwing
his
time
away
it
appears
and
even
the
kind
soul
from
boston
who
visited
him
suggested
sewell
go
on
visited
him
in
spite
of
his
wife
omniscience
even
the
kind
soul
from
boston
paltered
with
this
plain
duty
even
he
to
spare
himself
the
pain
of
hurting
the
boy
feelings
tried
to
find
some
of
the
lines
better
than
others
and
left
him
with
the
impression
that
he
had
praised
well
that
was
pretty
bad
said
miss
vane
you
had
to
tell
him
i
suppose
that
there
was
no
hope
for
him
yes
i
had
to
tell
him
at
last
after
letting
him
waste
his
time
and
money
in
writing
more
stuff
and
coming
to
boston
with
it
i
put
him
to
needless
shame
and
i
inflicted
suffering
upon
him
that
i
lighten
in
the
least
by
no
that
the
most
discouraging
thing
about
pitying
people
it
does
them
no
manner
of
good
said
miss
vane
and
just
hurts
you
you
think
that
in
an
advanced
civilisation
we
shall
cease
to
feel
compassion
why
do
you
preach
against
common
pity
as
you
did
against
common
politeness
well
it
is
quite
such
a
crying
sin
yet
but
really
really
exclaimed
sewell
the
world
seems
so
put
together
that
i
believe
we
ought
to
think
twice
before
doing
a
good
david
said
his
wife
warningly
oh
let
him
go
on
cried
miss
vane
with
a
laugh
i
proof
against
his
monstrous
doctrines
go
on
what
i
mean
is
sewell
pushed
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
then
stopped
is
what
prompted
both
the
ladies
why
suppose
the
boy
really
had
some
literary
faculty
should
i
have
had
any
right
to
encourage
it
he
was
very
well
where
he
was
he
fed
the
cows
and
milked
them
and
carried
the
milk
to
the
crossroads
where
the
dealer
collected
it
and
took
it
to
the
train
that
was
his
life
with
the
incidental
facts
of
cutting
the
hay
and
fodder
and
bedding
the
cattle
and
his
experience
never
went
beyond
it
i
doubt
if
his
fancy
ever
did
except
in
some
wild
mistaken
excursion
why
should
he
have
been
left
to
this
condition
he
ate
he
slept
he
fulfilled
his
use
which
of
us
does
more
how
would
you
like
to
have
been
in
his
place
asked
his
wife
i
could
myself
in
his
place
and
therefore
i
ought
to
have
done
anything
to
take
him
out
of
it
answered
sewell
it
seems
to
me
that
very
said
miss
vane
i
thought
we
had
prospered
up
to
the
present
point
by
taking
people
out
of
their
yes
we
have
replied
the
minister
and
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
the
result
is
hideous
i
do
mind
people
taking
themselves
out
of
their
places
but
if
the
particles
of
this
mighty
cosmos
have
been
adjusted
by
the
divine
wisdom
what
are
we
to
say
of
the
temerity
that
disturbs
the
least
of
them
i
sure
i
do
know
said
miss
vane
rising
i
almost
afraid
to
stir
in
view
of
the
possible
consequences
but
i
ca
sit
here
all
day
and
if
sewell
will
excuse
me
i
go
at
once
yes
guess
i
better
be
going
as
your
particle
barker
says
let
us
hope
he
get
safely
back
to
his
infinitesimal
little
crevice
in
the
cosmos
he
a
very
pretty
particle
do
you
think
that
thick
coarse
wavy
black
hair
growing
in
a
natural
bang
over
his
forehead
would
make
his
fortune
if
he
were
a
certain
kind
of
young
they
followed
her
to
the
door
chatting
and
sewell
looked
quickly
out
when
he
opened
it
for
her
as
she
shook
his
hand
she
broke
into
another
laugh
really
you
looked
as
if
you
were
afraid
of
finding
him
on
the
steps
if
i
could
only
have
got
near
the
poor
boy
said
sewell
to
his
wife
as
they
returned
withindoors
if
i
could
only
have
reached
him
where
he
lives
as
our
slang
says
but
do
what
i
would
i
could
find
any
common
ground
where
we
could
stand
together
we
were
as
unlike
as
if
we
were
of
two
different
species
i
saw
that
everything
i
said
bewildered
him
more
and
more
he
could
understand
me
our
education
is
unchristian
our
civilisation
is
pagan
they
both
ought
to
bring
us
in
closer
relations
with
our
and
they
both
only
put
us
more
widely
apart
every
one
of
us
dwells
in
an
impenetrable
solitude
we
understand
each
other
a
little
if
our
circumstances
are
similar
but
if
they
are
different
all
our
words
leave
us
dumb
and
iv
barker
walked
away
from
the
minister
door
without
knowing
where
he
was
going
and
with
a
heart
full
of
hot
pain
he
burned
with
a
confused
sense
of
shame
and
disappointment
and
anger
it
had
turned
out
just
as
his
mother
had
said
sewell
would
be
mighty
different
in
boston
from
what
he
was
that
day
at
willoughby
pastures
there
he
made
barker
think
everything
of
his
poetry
and
now
he
pretended
to
tell
him
that
it
was
not
worth
anything
and
he
kept
hinting
round
that
barker
had
better
go
back
home
and
stay
there
did
he
think
he
would
have
left
home
if
there
had
been
anything
for
him
to
do
there
had
not
he
as
much
as
told
him
that
he
was
obliged
to
find
something
to
make
a
living
by
and
help
the
rest
what
was
he
afraid
of
was
he
afraid
that
barker
wanted
to
come
and
live
off
he
could
show
him
that
there
was
no
great
danger
if
he
had
known
how
he
would
have
refused
even
to
stay
to
dinner
what
made
him
keep
the
pictures
of
these
people
who
had
got
along
if
he
thought
no
one
else
ought
to
try
barker
guessed
to
himself
that
if
that
agassiz
had
had
to
get
a
living
off
the
farm
at
willoughby
pastures
he
would
have
time
to
make
money
what
did
sewell
mean
by
speaking
of
that
nilsson
lady
by
her
surname
without
any
miss
or
was
that
the
way
people
talked
in
boston
sewell
had
talked
to
him
as
if
he
were
a
baby
and
did
not
know
anything
and
barker
was
mad
at
himself
for
having
stayed
half
a
minute
after
the
minister
had
owned
up
that
he
had
got
the
letter
he
wrote
him
he
wished
he
had
said
well
that
all
i
want
of
sir
and
walked
right
out
but
he
had
not
known
how
to
do
it
did
they
think
it
was
very
polite
to
go
on
talking
with
that
woman
who
laughed
so
much
and
forget
all
about
him
pretty
poor
sort
of
manners
to
eat
with
her
bonnet
on
and
tell
them
she
hated
their
victuals
barker
tried
to
rage
against
them
in
these
thoughts
but
at
the
bottom
of
all
was
a
simple
grief
that
he
should
have
lost
the
friend
whom
he
thought
he
had
in
the
minister
the
friend
he
had
talked
of
and
dreamed
of
ever
since
he
had
seen
and
heard
him
speak
those
cordial
words
the
friend
he
had
trusted
through
all
and
had
come
down
to
boston
counting
upon
so
much
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
as
he
stumbled
and
scuffled
along
the
brick
pavements
with
his
uncouth
country
walk
he
was
walking
up
a
straight
long
street
with
houses
just
alike
on
both
sides
and
bits
of
grass
before
them
that
sometimes
were
gay
with
late
autumn
flowers
a
track
ran
up
the
middle
and
the
cars
seemed
to
be
tinkling
by
all
the
time
and
people
getting
on
and
off
they
were
mostly
ladies
and
children
and
they
were
very
well
dressed
sometimes
they
stared
at
barker
as
they
crossed
his
way
in
entering
or
issuing
from
the
houses
but
generally
no
one
appeared
to
notice
him
in
some
of
the
windows
there
were
flowers
in
painted
pots
and
in
others
little
marble
images
on
stands
there
were
more
images
in
the
garden
that
barker
came
to
presently
an
image
of
washington
on
horseback
and
some
orator
speaking
with
his
hand
up
and
on
top
of
a
monument
a
kind
of
turk
holding
up
a
man
that
looked
sick
the
man
was
almost
naked
but
he
was
not
so
bad
as
the
image
of
a
woman
in
a
granite
basin
it
seemed
to
barker
that
it
ought
not
to
be
allowed
there
a
great
many
people
of
all
kinds
were
passing
through
the
garden
and
after
some
hesitation
he
went
in
too
and
walked
over
the
bridge
that
crossed
the
pond
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
where
there
were
rowboats
and
boats
with
images
of
swans
on
them
barker
made
a
sarcastic
reflection
that
boston
seemed
to
be
a
great
place
for
images
and
passed
rather
hurriedly
through
the
garden
on
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
there
were
beds
of
all
kinds
of
flowers
scattered
about
and
they
were
hardly
touched
by
the
cold
yet
if
he
had
been
in
better
heart
he
would
have
liked
to
look
round
a
little
but
he
felt
strange
being
there
all
alone
and
he
felt
very
he
wondered
if
this
were
the
public
garden
that
sewell
had
spoken
of
and
if
that
kind
of
grove
across
the
street
were
the
common
he
felt
much
more
at
home
in
it
as
he
wandered
up
and
down
the
walks
and
finally
sat
down
on
one
of
the
iron
benches
beside
the
path
at
first
he
obscurely
doubted
whether
he
had
any
right
to
do
so
unless
he
had
a
lady
with
him
most
of
the
seats
were
occupied
by
couples
who
seemed
to
be
courting
but
he
ventured
finally
to
take
one
nobody
disturbed
him
and
so
he
remained
it
was
a
beautiful
october
afternoon
the
wind
warm
and
dry
caught
the
yellow
leaves
from
the
trees
overhead
in
little
whiffs
and
blew
them
about
the
grass
which
the
fall
rains
had
made
as
green
as
may
and
a
pensive
golden
light
streamed
through
the
long
loose
boughs
and
struck
across
the
slopes
of
the
common
slight
buggies
flashed
by
on
the
street
near
which
he
sat
and
glistening
carriages
with
drivers
dressed
out
in
uniform
like
soldiers
rumbled
down
its
slope
while
he
sat
looking
now
at
the
street
and
now
at
the
people
sauntering
and
hurrying
to
and
fro
in
the
common
he
tried
to
decide
a
question
that
had
mixed
itself
up
with
the
formless
resentment
he
had
felt
ever
since
sewell
played
him
false
it
had
got
out
in
the
neighbourhood
that
he
was
going
to
boston
before
he
left
home
his
mother
must
have
told
it
and
people
would
think
he
was
to
be
gone
a
long
time
he
had
warned
his
mother
that
he
did
not
know
when
he
should
be
back
before
he
started
in
the
morning
and
he
knew
that
she
would
repeat
his
words
to
everybody
who
stopped
to
ask
about
him
during
the
day
with
what
she
had
said
to
him
in
reply
you
better
come
home
lem
and
i
have
ye
a
good
hot
supper
waitin
for
the
question
was
whether
he
should
go
back
on
the
five
train
which
would
reach
willoughby
centre
after
dark
and
house
himself
from
public
ignominy
for
one
night
at
least
or
whether
did
not
demand
that
he
should
stay
in
boston
for
hours
at
any
rate
and
see
if
something
would
not
happen
he
had
now
no
distinct
hope
of
anything
but
his
pride
and
shame
were
holding
him
fast
while
the
tugged
at
his
heart
and
made
him
almost
forget
the
poverty
that
had
spurred
him
to
the
adventure
of
coming
to
boston
he
could
see
the
cows
coming
home
through
the
swampy
meadow
as
plain
as
if
they
were
coming
across
the
common
his
mother
was
calling
them
she
and
his
sister
were
going
to
milk
in
his
absence
and
he
could
see
her
now
how
she
looked
going
out
to
call
the
cows
in
her
bare
grey
head
gaunt
of
neck
and
cheek
in
the
ugly
bloomer
dress
in
which
she
was
not
grotesque
to
his
eyes
though
it
usually
affected
strangers
with
stupefaction
or
alarm
but
it
all
seemed
far
away
as
far
as
if
it
were
in
another
planet
that
he
had
dropped
out
of
he
was
divided
from
it
by
his
failure
and
disgrace
he
thought
he
must
stay
and
try
for
something
he
did
not
know
what
but
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
throw
away
his
money
for
nothing
at
the
hotel
down
by
the
depot
where
he
had
left
his
bag
they
were
going
to
make
him
pay
fifty
cents
for
just
a
room
alone
any
them
beats
here
been
trying
to
come
their
games
on
at
first
barker
could
not
believe
himself
accosted
though
the
young
man
who
spoke
stood
directly
in
front
of
him
and
seemed
to
be
speaking
to
him
he
looked
up
and
the
young
man
added
heigh

do
know
what
you
mean

barker
confidence
sharps
young
feller
they
everywheres
and
you
forget
it
move
up
a
little
barker
was
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
bench
and
at
this
he
pushed
away
from
the
young
man
who
had
dropped
himself
sociably
beside
him
he
wore
a
pair
of
black
pantaloons
very
tight
in
the
legs
and
widening
at
the
foot
so
as
almost
to
cover
his
boots
his
coat
was
deeply
braided
and
his
waistcoat
was
cut
low
so
that
his
hung
out
from
the
which
it
would
have
done
well
to
cover

the
young

he
say

but

cheque

forty
dollars
and
the
other
feller
say

have
his
money

he
kind
of
insinuate
it
was
all
a
job
about

cheque
for
forty
dollars
anyway
and
that
make
the
first
feller
mad
and
he
take
out
the
check
and
ask
him
what
he
thought
o
that
and
the
other
feller
say
well
it
was
a
good
cheque
but

and
he
wanted
money
and
then
the
first
feller
say

along
to
the
bank
and
get
your
money
and
the
other
say

shut
then

other
feller

minute
he

corner
and
you

up
and
up
and
in
about
a
half
an
hour
or
may
be
less
time
you
begin
to
smell
a
rat
and
you
go
for
a
policeman
and
the
next
morning
you
find
your
name
in
the
papers
more
unfortunate
you
look
out
for
young
feller
wish
i
let
that
one
go
on
till
he
done
something
so
i
could
handed
him
over
to
the
cops
it
a
shame
they
allowed
to
go
when
the
cops
knows
hello
there
my
mate
the
young
man
spoke
as
if
they
had
been
talking
of
his
mate
and
expecting
him
and
another
young
man
his
counterpart
in
dress
but
of
a
sullen
and
heavy
demeanour
very
unlike
his
own
brisk
excitement
approached
flapping
a
in
his
hand
i
just
been
tellin
this
young
feller
about
that
beat
you
oh
he
all
right
said
the
mate
just
seen
him
down
on
tremont
street
between
two
cops
must
ha
caught
him
in
the
you
do
say
so
well
that
good
anyway
why
did
you
get
it
changed
demanded
the
young
man
with
painful
surprise
as
his
mate
handed
him
the
no
i
did
i
been
to
twenty
places
and
there
ai
no
small
bills
nowhere
the
last
place
i
offered
cents
if
change
why
did
you
offer
fifty
i
give
fifty
and
glad
to
do
it
why
i
to
have
this
bill
well
i
sorry
for
you
said
the
mate
with
ironical
sympathy
because
i
do
see
how
you
goin
to
git
it
done
wo
you
move
up
a
little
bit
young
feller
he
sat
down
on
the
other
side
of
barker
i
about
tired
he
took
his
head
between
his
hands
in
sign
of
extreme
fatigue
and
drooped
forward
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
lemuel
heart
beat
fifty
cents
would
pay
for
his
lodging
and
he
could
stay
till
the
next
day
and
prolong
the
chance
of
something
turning
up
without
too
sinful
a
waste
of
money
how
much
is
the
bill
he
asked
ten
dollars
said
the
young
man
despondently
and
will
you
give
me
fifty
cents
if
i
change
it
well
i
said
i
give
fifty
cents
replied
the
young
man
gloomily
and
i
it
a
bargain
said
lemuel
promptly
and
he
took
from
his
pocket
the
two
notes
that
formed
his
store
and
gave
them
to
the
young
man
he
looked
at
them
critically
how
do
i
know
they
good
he
asked
you
a
stranger
to
me
young
feller
and
how
do
i
know
you
tryin
to
beat
me
he
looked
sternly
at
lemuel
but
here
the
mate
interposed
how
does
know
that
you
ai
tryin
to
beat
he
asked
contemptuously
i
never
saw
such
a
feller
as
you
are
here
you
make
me
run
half
over
town
to
change
that
bill
and
now
when
a
gentleman
offers
to
break
it
for
you
you
have
to
go
and
accuse
him
of
tryin
to
put
off
counterfeit
money
on
you
if
i
was
him
i
see
you
oh
well
i
do
want
any
words
about
it
here
take
your
money
said
the
young
man
as
long
as
i
said
i
do
it
i
do
it
here
your
half
a
he
put
it
with
the
into
lemuel
hand
and
rose
briskly
you
stay
here
jimmy
till
i
come
back
i
wo
be
gone
a
he
walked
down
the
mall
and
went
out
of
the
gate
on
tremont
street
then
the
mate
came
to
himself
why
i
him
go
off
with
both
them
bills
now
and
he
owes
me
one
of
with
that
he
rose
from
lemuel
side
and
hurried
after
his
vanishing
comrade
before
he
was
out
of
sight
he
had
broken
into
a
run
lemuel
sat
looking
after
them
his
satisfaction
in
the
affair
alloyed
by
dislike
of
the
haste
with
which
it
had
been
transacted
his
rustic
mind
worked
slowly
it
was
not
wholly
content
even
with
a
result
in
its
own
favour
where
the
process
had
been
so
rapid
he
was
scarcely
able
to
fix
the
point
at
which
the
talk
ceased
to
be
a
warning
against
beats
and
became
his
opportunity
for
speculation
he
did
not
feel
quite
right
at
having
taken
the
fellow
and
yet
a
bargain
was
a
bargain
nevertheless
if
the
fellow
wanted
to
rue
it
lemuel
would
give
him
fifteen
minutes
to
come
back
and
get
his
money
and
he
sat
for
that
space
of
time
where
the
others
had
left
him
he
was
not
going
to
be
mean
and
he
might
have
waited
a
little
longer
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
behaviour
of
two
girls
who
came
up
and
sat
down
on
the
same
bench
with
him
they
could
not
have
been
above
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
old
and
lemuel
thought
they
were
very
pretty
but
they
talked
so
and
laughed
so
loud
and
scuffled
with
each
other
for
the
paper
of
chocolate
which
one
of
them
took
out
of
her
pocket
that
lemuel
after
first
being
abashed
by
the
fact
that
they
were
city
girls
became
disgusted
with
them
he
was
a
stickler
for
propriety
of
behaviour
among
girls
his
mother
had
taught
him
to
despise
anything
like
among
them
and
at
twenty
he
was
as
severely
virginal
in
his
morality
as
if
he
had
been
twelve
people
looked
back
at
these
tomboys
when
they
had
got
by
and
some
shabby
young
fellows
exchanged
saucy
speeches
with
them
when
lemuel
got
up
and
walked
away
in
reproving
dignity
one
of
the
hoydens
bounced
into
his
place
and
they
both
sent
a
cry
of
derision
after
him
but
lemuel
would
not
give
them
the
satisfaction
of
letting
them
know
that
he
heard
them
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
not
going
to
let
them
suppose
that
they
had
driven
him
away
he
went
very
slowly
down
to
the
street
where
a
great
many
were
passing
to
and
fro
and
waited
for
one
marked
fitchburg
lowell
and
eastern
he
was
not
going
to
take
it
but
he
meant
to
follow
it
on
its
way
to
those
stations
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
was
the
hotel
where
he
had
left
his
he
had
told
them
that
he
might
take
a
room
there
or
he
might
not
now
since
he
had
this
extra
he
thought
that
he
would
stay
for
the
night
it
probably
would
not
be
any
cheaper
at
the
other
hotels
he
ran
against
a
good
many
people
in
trying
to
keep
the
car
in
sight
but
by
leaving
the
sidewalk
from
time
to
time
where
it
was
most
crowded
he
managed
not
to
fall
very
much
behind
the
worst
was
that
the
track
went
crooking
and
turning
about
so
much
in
different
streets
that
he
began
to
lose
faith
in
its
direction
and
to
be
afraid
in
spite
of
the
sign
on
its
side
that
the
car
was
not
going
to
the
depots
after
all
but
it
came
in
sight
of
them
at
last
and
then
lemuel
blown
with
the
chase
but
secure
of
his
ground
stopped
and
rested
himself
against
the
side
of
a
wall
to
get
his
breath
the
pursuit
had
been
very
exhausting
and
at
times
it
had
been
mortifying
for
here
and
there
people
who
saw
him
running
after
the
car
had
supposed
he
wished
to
board
it
and
in
their
had
hailed
and
stopped
it
after
this
had
happened
twice
or
thrice
lemuel
perceived
that
he
was
an
object
of
contempt
to
the
passengers
in
the
car
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
about
it
he
was
not
going
to
pay
six
cents
to
ride
when
he
could
just
as
well
walk
and
on
the
other
hand
he
dared
not
lose
sight
of
the
car
for
he
had
no
other
means
of
finding
his
way
back
to
his
hotel
but
he
was
all
right
now
as
he
leaned
against
the
panting
and
mopping
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
he
saw
his
hotel
a
little
way
down
the
street
and
he
did
not
feel
anxious
about
it
gave
you
the
slip
after
all
said
a
passer
who
had
apparently
been
interested
in
lemuel
adventure
oh
i
did
want
to
catch
it
said
lemuel
ah
merely
fond
of
exercise
said
the
stranger
well
it
a
very
good
thing
if
you
do
overdo
he
walked
by
and
then
after
a
glance
at
lemuel
over
his
shoulder
he
returned
to
him
may
i
ask
why
you
wanted
to
chase
the
car
if
you
did
want
to
catch
it
lemuel
hesitated
he
did
not
like
to
confide
in
a
total
stranger
this
gentleman
looked
kind
and
friendly
but
he
was
all
the
more
likely
on
that
account
to
be
a
beat
the
expression
was
probably
such
as
a
beat
would
put
on
in
approaching
his
intended
prey
oh
nothing
said
lemuel
evasively
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
stranger
and
he
walked
away
with
what
lemuel
could
only
conjecture
was
the
air
of
a
baffled
beat
he
waited
till
he
was
safely
out
of
sight
and
then
followed
on
down
the
street
towards
his
hotel
when
he
reached
it
he
walked
boldly
up
to
the
clerk
desk
and
said
that
he
guessed
he
would
take
a
room
for
the
night
and
gave
him
the
check
for
his
bag
that
he
had
received
in
leaving
it
there
the
clerk
wrote
the
number
of
a
room
against
lemuel
name
in
the
register
and
then
glanced
at
the
bag
it
was
a
large
bag
of
oilcloth
a
kind
of
bag
which
is
by
nature
lank
and
hollow
and
must
be
made
almost
insupportably
heavy
before
it
shows
any
signs
of
repletion
the
shirt
and
pair
of
everyday
pantaloons
which
lemuel
had
dropped
that
morning
into
its
voracious
maw
made
no
apparent
effect
there
as
the
clerk
held
it
up
and
twirled
it
on
the
crook
of
his
thumb
i
guess
i
shall
have
to
get
the
money
for
that
room
in
advance
he
said
regarding
the
bag
very
critically
however
he
might
have
been
wounded
by
the
doubt
of
his
honesty
or
his
solvency
implied
in
this
speech
lemuel
said
nothing
but
took
out
his
note
and
handed
it
to
the
clerk
the
latter
said
apologetically
it
one
of
our
rules
where
there
is
baggage
and
then
glancing
at
the
note
he
flung
it
quickly
across
the
counter
to
lemuel
that
wo
do
wo
do
repeated
lemuel
taking
up
the
bill
counterfeit
said
the
clerk
lemuel
stretched
the
note
between
his
hands
and
pored
so
long
upon
it
that
the
clerk
began
to
tap
impatiently
with
his
on
the
register
it
wo
go
faltered
the
boy
looking
up
at
the
sharp
face
it
wo
go
here
replied
the
clerk
got
anything
else
lemuel
head
whirled
the
air
seemed
to
darken
around
him
as
he
pored
again
upon
the
note
and
turned
it
over
and
over
two
tears
scalded
their
way
down
his
cheeks
and
his
lips
twitched
when
the
clerk
added
some
beats
been
workin
you
but
he
made
no
answer
his
heart
was
hot
with
shame
and
rage
and
heavy
with
despair
he
put
the
note
in
his
pocket
and
took
his
bag
and
walked
out
of
the
hotel
he
had
not
money
enough
to
get
home
with
now
and
besides
he
could
not
bear
to
go
back
in
the
disgrace
of
such
calamity
it
would
be
all
over
the
neighbourhood
as
soon
as
his
mother
could
tell
it
she
might
wish
to
keep
it
to
herself
for
his
sake
but
she
could
not
help
telling
it
to
the
first
person
and
every
person
she
saw
she
would
have
to
go
over
to
the
neighbours
to
tell
it
in
a
dreary
homesick
longing
he
saw
her
crossing
the
familiar
meadows
that
lay
between
the
houses
bareheaded
in
her
apron
her
face
set
and
rigid
with
wonder
at
what
had
happened
to
her
lem
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
he
would
rather
die
he
would
rather
go
to
sea
this
idea
flashed
into
his
mind
as
he
lifted
his
eyes
aimlessly
and
caught
sight
of
the
tall
masts
of
the
lying
at
the
railroad
wharves
and
he
walked
quickly
in
the
direction
of
them
so
as
not
to
give
himself
time
to
think
about
it
so
as
to
do
it
now
quick
right
off
but
he
found
his
way
impeded
by
all
sorts
of
obstacles
a
gate
closed
across
the
street
to
let
some
trains
draw
in
and
out
of
a
station
then
a
lot
of
string
teams
and
slow
trucks
got
before
him
with
a
turmoil
of
express
wagons
herdics
and
hacks
in
which
he
was
near
being
run
over
and
was
yelled
at
sworn
at
and
laughed
at
as
he
stood
bewildered
with
his
lank
bag
in
his
hand
he
turned
and
walked
back
past
the
hotel
again
he
felt
it
an
escape
after
all
not
to
have
gone
to
sea
and
now
a
hopeful
thought
struck
him
he
would
go
back
to
the
common
and
watch
for
those
fellows
who
fooled
him
and
set
the
police
on
them
and
get
his
money
from
them
they
might
come
prowling
round
again
to
fool
somebody
else
he
looked
out
for
a
car
marked
like
the
one
he
had
followed
down
from
the
common
and
began
to
follow
it
on
its
return
he
got
ahead
of
the
car
whenever
it
stopped
so
as
to
be
spared
the
shame
of
being
seen
to
chase
it
and
he
managed
to
keep
it
in
sight
till
he
reached
the
common
there
he
walked
about
looking
for
those
scamps
and
getting
pushed
and
hustled
by
the
people
who
now
thronged
the
paths
at
last
he
was
tired
out
and
on
the
beacon
street
mall
where
he
had
first
seen
those
fellows
he
found
the
very
seat
where
they
had
all
sat
together
and
sank
into
it
the
seats
were
mostly
vacant
now
a
few
persons
sat
there
reading
their
evening
papers
as
the
light
began
to
wane
they
folded
up
their
papers
and
walked
away
and
their
places
were
filled
by
young
men
who
at
once
put
their
arms
round
the
young
women
with
them
and
seemed
to
be
courting
they
did
not
say
much
if
anything
they
just
sat
there
it
made
lemuel
ashamed
to
look
at
them
he
thought
they
ought
to
have
more
sense
he
looked
away
but
he
could
not
look
away
from
them
all
there
were
so
many
of
them
he
was
all
the
time
very
hungry
but
he
thought
he
ought
not
to
break
into
his
as
long
as
he
could
help
it
or
till
there
was
no
chance
left
of
catching
those
fellows
the
night
came
on
the
were
lighted
and
some
lights
higher
up
like
moonlight
off
on
the
other
paths
projected
long
glares
into
the
night
and
made
the
gas
look
sickly
and
yellow
sitting
still
there
while
it
grew
later
he
did
not
feel
quite
so
hungry
but
he
felt
more
tired
than
ever
there
were
not
so
many
people
around
now
and
he
did
not
see
why
he
should
not
lie
down
on
that
seat
and
rest
himself
a
little
he
made
feints
of
reclining
on
his
arm
at
first
to
see
if
he
were
noticed
then
he
stretched
himself
out
with
his
bag
under
his
head
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
clutching
the
money
which
he
meant
to
make
those
fellows
take
back
he
got
a
in
range
to
keep
him
awake
and
lay
squinting
his
eyes
to
meet
the
path
of
rays
running
down
from
it
to
him
then
he
shivered
and
rose
up
with
a
sudden
start
the
dull
rich
dawn
was
hanging
under
the
trees
around
him
while
the
electric
lamps
like
paler
moons
now
still
burned
among
their
tops
the
sparrows
bickered
on
the
grass
and
the
gravel
of
the
path
around
him
he
could
not
tell
where
he
was
at
first
but
presently
he
remembered
and
looked
for
his
bag
it
was
gone
and
the
money
was
gone
out
of
both
his
pockets
he
dropped
back
upon
the
seat
and
leaning
his
head
against
the
back
he
began
to
cry
for
utter
despair
he
had
hardly
ever
cried
since
he
was
a
baby
and
he
would
not
have
done
it
now
but
there
was
no
one
there
to
see
him
when
he
had
his
cry
out
he
felt
a
little
better
and
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
pond
in
the
hollow
and
washed
his
hands
and
face
and
wiped
them
on
the
handkerchief
his
mother
had
ironed
for
him
to
use
at
the
minister
it
was
still
in
the
folds
she
had
given
it
as
he
shook
it
out
rising
up
he
saw
that
people
were
asleep
on
all
the
benches
round
the
pond
he
looked
hopelessly
at
them
to
see
if
any
of
them
were
those
fellows
but
he
could
not
find
them
he
seemed
to
be
the
only
person
awake
on
the
common
and
wandered
out
of
it
and
down
through
the
empty
streets
filled
at
times
with
the
moony
light
of
the
waning
electrics
and
at
times
merely
with
the
grey
dawn
a
man
came
along
putting
out
the
gas
and
some
rattled
over
the
pavement
by
and
by
a
with
the
leaves
and
roots
of
cabbages
sticking
out
from
the
edges
of
the
canvas
that
covered
it
came
by
and
lemuel
followed
it
he
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
and
it
went
so
slow
that
he
could
keep
up
though
the
famine
that
gnawed
within
him
was
so
sharp
sometimes
that
he
felt
as
if
he
must
fall
down
he
was
going
to
drop
into
a
doorway
and
rest
but
when
he
came
to
it
he
found
on
an
upper
step
a
man
folded
forward
like
a
limp
bundle
snoring
in
a
fetid
sodden
sleep
and
shocked
into
new
strength
he
hurried
on
at
last
the
wagon
came
to
a
place
that
he
saw
was
a
market
there
were
no
buyers
yet
but
men
were
flitting
round
under
the
long
arcades
of
the
with
lanterns
under
their
arms
among
boxes
and
barrels
of
melons
apples
potatoes
onions
beans
carrots
and
other
vegetables
which
the
country
carts
as
they
arrived
continually
unloaded
the
smell
of
peaches
and
cantaloupes
filled
the
air
and
made
lemuel
giddy
as
he
stood
and
looked
at
the
abundance
the
men
were
not
saying
much
now
and
then
one
of
them
priced
something
the
owner
pretended
to
figure
on
it
and
then
they
fell
into
a
playful
scuffle
but
all
silently
a
black
cat
lay
luxuriously
asleep
on
the
canvas
top
of
a
barrel
of
melons
and
the
man
who
priced
the
melons
asked
if
the
owner
would
throw
the
cat
in
there
was
a
butcher
cart
laden
with
carcasses
of
sheep
and
one
of
the
men
asked
the
butcher
if
he
called
that
stuff
mutton
no
imitation
said
the
butcher
they
all
seemed
to
be
very
lemuel
thought
he
would
ask
for
an
apple
but
he
could
not
the
neighbouring
restaurants
began
to
send
forth
the
smell
of
breakfast
and
he
dragged
up
and
down
till
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
then
went
into
one
of
them
meaning
to
ask
for
some
job
by
which
he
could
pay
for
a
meal
but
his
shame
again
would
not
let
him
he
looked
at
the
fat
boy
drawing
coffee
hot
from
a
huge
urn
and
serving
a
countryman
with
a
beefsteak
it
was
close
and
sultry
in
there
the
open
was
black
with
flies
and
a
scent
of
decaying
meat
came
from
the
next
cellar
like
some
nice
fresh
said
the
boy
to
lemuel
he
did
not
answer
he
looked
around
as
if
he
had
come
in
search
of
some
one
then
he
went
out
and
straying
away
from
the
market
he
found
himself
after
a
while
in
a
street
that
opened
upon
the
common
he
was
glad
to
sit
down
and
he
said
to
himself
that
now
he
would
stay
there
and
keep
a
good
lookout
for
the
chaps
that
had
robbed
him
but
again
he
fell
asleep
and
he
did
not
wake
now
till
the
sun
was
high
and
the
paths
of
the
common
were
filled
with
hurrying
people
he
sat
where
he
had
slept
for
he
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
or
where
to
go
sometimes
he
thought
he
would
go
to
sewell
and
ask
him
for
money
enough
to
get
home
but
he
could
not
do
it
he
could
more
easily
starve
after
an
hour
or
two
he
went
to
get
a
drink
at
a
fountain
he
saw
a
little
way
off
and
when
he
came
back
some
people
had
got
his
seat
he
started
to
look
for
another
and
on
his
way
he
found
a
cent
in
the
path
and
he
bought
an
apple
with
it
a
small
one
that
the
dealer
especially
picked
out
for
cheapness
it
seemed
pretty
queer
to
lemuel
that
a
person
should
want
anything
for
one
apple
the
apple
when
he
ate
it
made
him
sick
his
head
began
to
ache
and
it
ached
all
day
late
in
the
afternoon
he
caught
sight
of
one
of
those
fellows
at
a
distance
but
there
was
no
policeman
near
lemuel
called
out
stop
there
you
but
the
fellow
began
to
run
when
he
recognised
lemuel
and
the
boy
was
too
weak
and
faint
to
run
after
him
the
day
wore
away
and
the
evening
came
again
and
he
had
been
hours
houseless
and
without
food
he
must
do
something
he
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
there
was
no
sense
in
it
he
had
read
in
the
newspapers
how
they
gave
soup
at
the
in
boston
in
the
winter
perhaps
they
gave
something
in
summer
he
mustered
up
courage
to
ask
a
gentleman
who
passed
where
the
nearest
station
was
and
then
started
in
search
of
it
if
the
city
gave
it
then
there
was
no
disgrace
in
it
and
lemuel
had
as
much
right
to
anything
that
was
going
as
other
people
that
was
the
way
he
silenced
his
pride
but
he
missed
the
place
he
must
have
gone
down
the
wrong
street
from
tremont
to
washington
the
gentleman
had
said
the
street
that
ran
along
the
common
was
tremont
and
the
next
was
washington
the
that
lemuel
got
into
was
filled
with
people
going
and
coming
and
lounging
about
there
were
girls
going
along
two
or
three
together
with
books
under
their
arms
and
other
girls
talking
with
young
fellows
who
hung
about
the
doors
of
brightly
lighted
shops
and
flirting
with
them
one
of
the
girls
whom
he
had
seen
the
day
before
in
the
common
turned
upon
lemuel
as
he
passed
and
said
there
goes
my
young
man
good
evening
johnny
it
made
lemuel
cheek
burn
he
would
have
liked
to
box
her
ears
for
her
the
fellows
all
set
up
a
laugh
towards
the
end
of
the
street
the
crowd
thickened
and
there
the
mixture
of
gas
and
the
white
moony
lights
that
glared
higher
up
and
winked
and
hissed
shone
upon
the
faces
of
a
throng
that
had
gathered
about
the
doors
and
windows
of
a
store
a
little
way
down
the
other
street
lemuel
joined
them
and
for
pure
listlessness
waited
round
to
see
what
they
were
looking
at
by
and
by
he
was
worked
inward
by
the
shifting
and
changing
of
the
crowd
and
found
himself
looking
in
at
the
door
of
a
room
splendidly
fitted
up
with
mirrors
and
marble
everywhere
and
coloured
glass
and
carved
mahogany
there
was
a
long
counter
with
three
men
behind
it
and
over
their
heads
was
a
large
painting
of
a
woman
worse
than
that
image
in
the
garden
the
men
were
serving
out
liquor
to
the
people
that
stood
around
drinking
and
smoking
and
battening
on
this
picture
lemuel
could
not
help
looking
either
what
place
is
this
he
asked
of
the
boy
next
him
why
do
you
know
said
the
boy
it
jimmy
baker
just
oh
said
lemuel
he
was
not
going
to
let
the
boy
see
that
he
did
not
know
who
jimmy
baker
was
just
then
something
caught
his
eye
that
had
a
more
powerful
charm
for
him
than
that
painting
it
was
a
large
bowl
at
the
end
of
the
counter
which
had
broken
crackers
in
it
and
near
it
were
two
plates
one
with
cheese
and
one
with
bits
of
dried
fish
and
smoked
meat
the
sight
made
the
water
come
into
his
mouth
he
watched
like
a
hungry
dog
with
a
sympathetic
working
of
the
jaws
the
men
who
took
a
bit
of
fish
or
meat
or
cheese
and
a
cracker
or
all
four
of
them
before
or
after
they
drank
presently
one
of
the
crowd
near
him
walked
in
and
took
some
fish
and
cracker
without
drinking
at
all
he
merely
winked
at
one
of
the
bartenders
who
winked
at
him
in
return
a
tremendous
tide
of
daring
rose
in
lemuel
breast
he
was
just
going
to
go
in
and
risk
the
same
thing
himself
when
a
voice
in
the
crowd
behind
him
said
hai
you
had
enough
young
feller
some
the
rest
of
us
would
like
a
chance
to
see
lemuel
knew
the
voice
and
turning
quickly
he
knew
the
impudent
face
it
belonged
to
he
did
not
mind
the
laugh
raised
at
his
expense
but
launched
himself
across
the
intervening
spectators
and
tried
to
seize
the
scamp
who
had
got
his
money
from
him
the
scamp
had
recognised
lemuel
too
and
he
fell
back
beyond
his
grasp
and
then
lunged
through
the
crowd
and
tore
round
the
corner
and
up
the
street
lemuel
followed
as
fast
as
he
could
in
spite
of
the
weakness
he
had
felt
before
wrath
and
the
sense
of
wrong
lent
him
speed
and
he
was
gaining
in
the
chase
when
he
heard
a
girl
voice
there
goes
one
of
them
now
and
then
a
man
seemed
to
be
calling
after
him
stop
there
he
turned
round
and
a
policeman
looking
gigantic
in
his
belted
blue
flannel
blouse
and
his
straw
helmet
bore
down
upon
the
country
boy
with
his
club
drawn
and
seized
him
by
the
collar
you
come
along
he
said
i
have
done
anything
said
lemuel
submitting
as
he
must
and
in
his
surprise
and
terror
losing
the
strength
his
wrath
had
given
him
he
could
scarcely
drag
his
feet
over
the
pavement
and
the
policeman
had
almost
to
carry
him
at
arm
length
a
crowd
had
gathered
about
them
and
was
following
lemuel
and
his
captor
but
they
fell
back
when
they
reached
the
steps
of
the
and
lemuel
was
pulled
up
alone
and
pushed
in
at
the
door
he
was
pushed
through
another
door
and
found
himself
in
a
kind
of
office
a
stout
man
in
his
was
sitting
behind
a
desk
within
a
railing
and
a
large
book
lay
open
on
the
desk
this
man
whose
blue
waistcoat
with
brass
buttons
marked
him
for
some
sort
of
officer
looked
impersonally
at
lemuel
and
then
at
the
officer
while
he
chewed
a
quill
toothpick
rolling
it
in
his
lips
what
have
you
got
there
he
asked
assaulting
a
girl
down
here
and
grabbing
her
satchel
said
the
officer
who
had
arrested
lemuel
releasing
his
collar
and
going
to
the
door
whence
he
called
you
come
in
here
lady
and
a
young
girl
her
face
red
with
weeping
and
her
hair
disordered
came
back
with
him
she
held
a
crumpled
straw
hat
with
the
brim
torn
loose
and
in
spite
of
her
disordered
looks
she
was
very
pretty
with
blue
eyes
flung
very
wide
open
and
rough
brown
hair
wavy
and
cut
short
almost
like
a
boy
this
lemuel
saw
in
the
frightened
glance
they
exchanged
this
the
fellow
that
assaulted
you
asked
the
man
at
the
desk
nodding
his
head
toward
lemuel
who
tried
to
speak
but
it
was
like
a
nightmare
he
could
not
make
any
sound
there
were
three
of
them
said
the
girl
with
hysterical
volubility
one
of
them
pulled
my
hat
down
over
my
eyes
and
tore
it
and
one
of
them
held
me
by
the
elbows
behind
and
they
grabbed
my
satchel
away
that
had
a
book
in
it
that
i
had
just
got
out
of
the
library
i
had
got
it
more
than
what
name
asked
the
man
at
the
desk
a
young
man
darling
said
the
girl
after
a
bashful
hesitation
lemuel
had
read
that
book
just
before
he
left
home
he
had
not
thought
it
was
much
of
a
book
the
captain
wants
to
know
your
name
said
the
officer
in
charge
of
lemuel
oh
said
the
girl
with
mortification
statira
what
age
asked
the
captain
nineteen
last
june
replied
the
girl
with
eager
promptness
that
must
have
come
from
shame
from
the
blunder
she
had
made
lemuel
was
twenty
the
of
july
weight
pursued
the
captain
well
i
hai
been
weighed
very
answered
the
girl
with
increasing
interest
i
do
know
as
i
been
weighed
since
i
left
the
captain
looked
at
her
judicially
that
so
well
you
look
pretty
solid
guess
i
put
you
down
at
a
hundred
and
well
i
guess
it
full
as
as
that
said
the
girl
with
a
flattered
laugh
dunno
how
high
you
are
suggested
the
captain
glancing
at
her
again
well
yes
i
i
am
just
five
feet
two
inches
and
a
you
do
look
it
said
the
captain
critically
well
i
insisted
the
girl
with
a
returning
gaiety
the
captain
apparently
checked
himself
and
put
on
a
professional
severity
what
business
occupation
said
the
girl
residence
no
pleasant
the
captain
leaned
back
in
his
and
turned
his
toothpick
between
his
lips
as
he
stared
hard
at
the
girl
well
now
he
said
after
a
moment
you
know
you
got
to
come
into
court
and
testify
yes
said
the
girl
rather
falteringly
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
lemuel
you
got
to
promise
to
do
it
or
else
it
will
be
my
duty
to
have
you
locked
up
have
me
locked
up
gasped
the
girl
her
wide
blue
eyes
filling
with
astonishment
detain
you
as
a
witness
the
captain
explained
of
course
we
should
put
you
in
a
cell
we
should
give
you
a
good
room
and
if
you
ai
sure
you
appear
in
the
morning
the
girl
was
not
of
the
sort
whose
tongues
are
paralysed
by
terror
oh
i
be
to
appear
captain
indeed
i
will
captain
you
lock
me
up
captain
lock
me
she
broke
off
indignantly
it
would
be
a
idea
if
i
was
first
to
be
robbed
of
my
satchel
and
then
put
in
prison
for
it
overnight
a
great
kind
of
law
would
be
why
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
i
think
it
a
perfect
shame
i
want
to
know
if
that
the
way
you
do
with
poor
things
that
you
do
know
about
that
about
the
size
of
it
said
the
captain
permitting
himself
a
smile
in
which
the
officer
joined
well
it
a
shame
cried
the
girl
now
carried
far
beyond
her
personal
interest
in
the
matter
the
captain
laughed
outright
it
pretty
rough
but
what
you
going
to
do
do
why
i
but
here
she
stopped
for
want
of
science
and
added
from
emotion
i
do
before
i
do
well
said
the
captain
then
i
understand
you
come
round
to
the
police
court
and
give
your
testimony
in
the
morning
yes
said
the
girl
with
a
vague
compassionate
glance
at
lemuel
who
had
stood
there
dumb
throughout
the
colloquy
if
you
do
i
shall
have
to
send
for
you
said
the
captain
oh
i
replied
the
girl
in
a
sort
of
disgust
and
her
eyes
still
dwelt
upon
lemuel
that
all
returned
the
captain
and
the
girl
accepting
her
dismissal
went
out
now
that
it
was
too
late
lemuel
could
break
from
his
nightmare
oh
do
let
her
go
i
ai
the
one
i
was
running
after
a
fellow
that
passed
off
a
counterfeit
bill
on
me
in
the
common
yesterday
i
never
touched
her
satchel
i
never
saw
her
before
what
that
demanded
the
captain
sharply
you
got
the
wrong
one
cried
lemuel
i
never
did
anything
to
the
why
you
fool
retorted
the
captain
angrily
why
did
you
say
that
when
she
was
here
instead
of
standing
there
like
a
dumb
animal
heigh
lemuel
sudden
flow
of
speech
was
stopped
at
its
source
again
his
lips
were
locked
he
could
not
answer
a
word
the
captain
went
on
angrily
if
you
spoke
up
in
time
may
be
i
might
let
you
go
i
do
want
to
do
a
man
any
harm
if
i
ca
do
him
some
good
next
time
if
you
got
a
tongue
in
your
head
use
it
i
ca
do
anything
for
you
now
i
got
to
commit
he
paused
between
his
sentences
as
if
to
let
lemuel
speak
but
the
boy
said
nothing
the
captain
pulled
his
book
impatiently
toward
him
and
took
up
his
pen
what
your
name
lemuel
i
thought
may
be
there
was
a
mistake
all
the
while
said
the
captain
to
the
officer
while
he
wrote
down
lemuel
name
but
if
a
man
got
sense
enough
to
speak
for
himself
i
ca
put
the
words
in
his
mouth
age
he
demanded
savagely
of
lemuel
weight
a
hundred
and
i
could
see
with
half
an
eye
that
the
girl
wa
very
sanguine
about
it
but
what
the
use
i
could
tell
her
she
was
mistaken
height
five
feet
occupation
i
help
mother
carry
on
the
just
as
i
expected
cried
the
captain
slow
as
a
yoke
of
oxen
residence
willoughby
the
captain
could
not
contain
himself
well
willoughby
pastures
or
whatever
your
name
is
you
get
yourself
into
the
papers
time
and
i
must
say
it
serves
you
right
if
you
ca
speak
for
yourself
who
going
to
speak
for
you
do
you
suppose
might
send
round
to
the
girl
house
no
she
would
be
there
ten
to
one
you
got
to
go
through
now
next
time
do
be
such
an
infernal
the
captain
blotted
his
book
and
shut
it
we
have
to
lock
him
up
here
he
said
to
the
policeman
last
batch
has
gone
round
better
go
through
but
lemuel
had
been
gone
through
before
and
the
officer
search
of
his
pockets
only
revealed
their
emptiness
the
captain
struck
a
bell
on
his
desk
if
it
ai
all
right
you
can
make
it
right
with
the
judge
in
the
morning
he
added
to
lemuel
lemuel
looked
up
at
the
policeman
who
had
arrested
him
he
was
an
elderly
man
with
a
kindly
face
squarely
fringed
with
a
the
boy
tried
to
speak
but
he
could
only
repeat
i
never
saw
her
before
i
never
touched
the
policeman
looked
at
him
and
then
at
the
captain
too
late
now
said
the
latter
got
to
go
through
the
mill
this
time
but
if
it
ai
right
you
can
make
it
another
officer
had
answered
the
bell
and
the
captain
indicated
with
a
comprehensive
roll
of
his
head
that
he
was
to
take
lemuel
away
and
lock
him
up
oh
my
moaned
the
boy
as
they
passed
the
door
of
a
small
room
opening
on
an
inner
corridor
a
smell
of
coffee
gushed
out
of
it
the
officer
stopped
and
lemuel
caught
sight
of
two
gentlemen
in
the
room
with
a
policeman
who
was
saying
get
a
cup
of
coffee
here
when
we
want
it
try
one
he
suggested
hospitably
no
thank
you
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
with
the
bland
respectfulness
of
people
being
shown
about
an
institution
how
many
of
you
are
attached
to
this
station
said
the
officer
largest
station
in
town
gang
goes
on
at
one
in
the
morning
and
another
at
eight
and
another
at
six
he
looked
inquiringly
at
the
officer
in
charge
of
lemuel
any
matches
asked
this
officer
everything
but
money
said
the
other
taking
some
matches
out
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
lemuel
officer
went
ahead
lighting
the
gas
along
the
corridor
and
the
boy
followed
while
the
other
officer
brought
up
the
rear
with
the
visitor
whom
he
was
lecturing
they
passed
some
neat
rooms
each
with
two
beds
in
it
and
he
answered
some
question
tramps
not
much
give
a
when
they
drunk
send
round
to
the
lodge
when
they
sober
these
officers
lemuel
followed
his
officer
downstairs
into
a
basement
where
on
either
side
of
a
brilliantly
lighted
specklessly
clean
corridor
there
were
numbers
of
cells
very
clean
and
smelling
of
fresh
whitewash
each
had
a
broad
low
shelf
in
it
and
a
bench
opposite
a
little
wider
than
a
man
body
lemuel
suddenly
felt
himself
pushed
into
one
of
them
and
then
a
railed
door
of
iron
was
locked
upon
him
he
stood
motionless
in
the
breadth
of
light
and
lines
of
shade
which
the
cast
upon
him
through
the
door
and
knew
the
gentlemen
were
looking
at
him
as
their
guide
talked
well
fill
up
pretty
well
sunday
nights
most
the
arrests
for
drunkenness
but
all
the
arrests
before
seven
sent
to
the
city
prison
only
keep
them
that
come
in
one
of
the
gentlemen
looked
into
the
cell
opposite
lemuel
there
seems
to
be
only
one
bunk
do
you
ever
put
more
into
a
cell
well
hardly
ever
if
they
men
lot
o
women
brought
in
always
ask
to
be
locked
up
together
for
i
do
see
where
they
sleep
said
the
visitor
do
they
lie
on
the
floor
the
officer
laughed
sleep
do
want
to
sleep
what
they
want
to
do
is
to
set
up
all
night
and
talk
it
both
of
the
visitors
laughed
some
of
the
cells
resumed
the
officer
have
two
bunks
but
we
hardly
ever
put
more
than
one
in
a
the
visitors
noticed
that
a
section
of
the
rail
was
removed
in
each
door
near
the
floor
that
to
put
a
dipper
of
water
through
or
anything
explained
the
officer
there
he
continued
showing
them
lemuel
door
see
how
the
rails
are
bent
there
you
would
think
a
man
could
squeeze
through
there
but
we
found
a
fellow
half
out
o
that
one
night
backwards
captain
came
down
with
a
rattan
and
made
it
hot
for
the
visitors
laughed
and
lemuel
in
his
cell
shuddered
i
never
saw
anything
so
astonishingly
clean
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
and
do
you
keep
the
gas
burning
here
all
night
yes
calculate
to
give
plenty
of
light
said
the
officer
with
comfortable
satisfaction
in
the
visitor
complimentary
tone
and
the
sanitary
arrangements
seem
to
be
perfect
doctor
said
the
other
visitor
oh
yes
said
the
officer
we
do
the
best
we
can
for
the
visitors
made
a
murmur
of
approbation
their
steps
moved
away
lemuel
heard
the
guide
saying
dunno
what
that
fellow
in
for
find
out
in
the
captain
he
did
look
like
a
very
abandoned
ruffian
said
one
of
the
visitors
with
both
pity
and
amusement
in
his
voice
vi
lemuel
stood
and
leaned
his
head
against
the
wall
of
his
cell
the
tears
that
had
come
to
his
relief
in
the
morning
when
he
found
that
he
was
robbed
would
not
come
now
he
was
trembling
with
famine
and
weakness
but
he
could
not
lie
down
it
would
be
like
accepting
his
fate
and
every
fibre
of
his
body
joined
his
soul
in
rebellion
against
that
the
hunger
gnawed
him
incessantly
mixed
with
an
awful
sickness
after
a
long
time
a
policeman
passed
his
door
with
another
prisoner
a
drunken
woman
whom
he
locked
into
a
cell
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
when
he
came
back
lemuel
could
endure
it
no
longer
say
he
called
huskily
through
his
door
wo
you
give
me
a
cup
of
that
coffee
upstairs
i
have
had
anything
but
an
apple
to
eat
for
nearly
two
days
i
do
want
you
to
me
the
coffee
you
can
take
my
clasp
button
the
officer
went
by
a
few
steps
then
he
came
back
and
peered
in
through
the
door
at
lemuel
face
oh
that
you
he
said
he
was
the
officer
who
had
arrested
lemuel
yes
please
get
me
the
coffee
i
afraid
i
shall
have
a
fit
of
sickness
if
i
go
much
well
said
the
officer
i
guess
i
can
get
you
he
went
away
and
came
back
after
lemuel
had
given
up
the
hope
of
his
return
with
a
saucerless
cup
of
coffee
and
a
slice
of
buttered
bread
laid
on
the
top
of
it
he
passed
it
in
through
the
opening
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
oh
my
gasped
the
starving
boy
he
thought
he
should
drop
the
cup
his
hand
shook
so
when
he
took
it
he
gulped
the
coffee
and
swallowed
the
bread
in
a
frenzy
here
here
the
button
he
said
as
he
passed
the
empty
cup
out
to
the
officer
i
do
want
your
button
answered
the
policeman
he
hesitated
a
moment
i
shall
be
round
at
the
court
in
the
morning
and
i
guess
if
it
ai
right
we
can
make
it
thank
you
sir
said
lemuel
humbly
grateful
you
lay
down
now
said
the
officer
we
sha
put
anybody
in
on
you
i
guess
i
better
said
lemuel
he
crept
in
upon
the
lower
shelf
and
stretched
himself
out
in
his
clothes
with
his
arm
under
his
head
for
a
pillow
the
drunken
woman
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
was
clamouring
to
get
out
she
wished
to
get
out
just
half
a
minute
she
said
and
settle
with
that
hussy
then
she
would
come
back
willingly
sometimes
she
sang
sometimes
she
swore
but
with
the
coffee
still
sensibly
hot
in
his
stomach
and
the
comfort
of
it
in
every
vein
her
uproar
turned
into
an
agreeable
fantastic
medley
for
lemuel
and
he
thought
it
was
the
folks
singing
in
church
at
willoughby
pastures
and
they
were
all
asking
him
who
the
new
girl
in
the
choir
was
and
he
was
saying
statira
dudley
and
then
it
all
slipped
off
into
a
smooth
yellow
nothingness
and
he
heard
some
one
calling
him
to
get
up
when
he
woke
in
the
morning
he
started
up
so
suddenly
that
he
struck
his
head
against
the
shelf
above
him
and
lay
staring
stupidly
at
the
of
his
door
he
heard
the
order
to
turn
out
repeated
at
other
cells
along
the
corridor
and
he
crept
out
of
his
shelf
and
then
sat
down
upon
it
waiting
for
his
door
to
be
unlocked
he
was
very
hungry
again
and
he
trembled
with
faintness
he
wondered
how
he
should
get
his
breakfast
and
he
dreaded
the
trial
in
court
less
than
the
thought
of
going
through
another
day
with
nothing
to
eat
he
heard
the
stir
of
the
other
prisoners
in
the
cells
along
the
corridors
the
low
groans
and
sighs
with
which
people
pull
themselves
together
after
a
bad
night
and
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
drunken
woman
now
sober
poured
out
in
voluble
remorse
and
in
voluble
promise
of
amendment
for
the
future
to
every
one
who
passed
if
they
would
let
her
off
easy
she
said
aisy
of
course
and
it
was
in
her
native
accent
that
she
bewailed
the
fate
of
the
little
ones
whom
her
arrest
had
left
motherless
at
home
no
one
seemed
to
answer
her
but
presently
she
broke
into
a
cry
of
joy
and
blessing
and
from
her
cell
at
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
came
the
clink
of
crockery
steps
approached
with
several
pauses
and
at
last
they
paused
at
lemuel
door
and
a
man
outside
stooped
and
pushed
in
through
the
opening
at
the
bottom
a
big
bowl
of
baked
beans
a
quarter
of
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
tin
cup
full
of
coffee
coffee
extra
he
said
jocosely
comes
from
the
officers
you
in
luck
young
i
got
anything
to
pay
for
it
with
faltered
lemuel
guess
they
trust
you
said
the
man
i
got
orders
to
leave
he
passed
on
and
lemuel
gathered
up
his
breakfast
and
arranged
it
on
the
shelf
where
he
had
slept
then
he
knelt
down
before
it
and
ate
an
hour
later
an
officer
came
and
unbolted
his
door
from
the
outside
hurry
up
he
said
maria
maria
repeated
lemuel
innocently
yes
returned
the
officer
other
name
black
she
do
like
to
wait
come
out
of
lemuel
found
himself
in
the
corridor
with
four
or
five
other
prisoners
whom
some
officers
took
in
charge
and
conducted
upstairs
to
the
door
of
the
station
he
saw
no
woman
but
a
sort
of
omnibus
without
windows
was
drawn
up
at
the
curbstone
i
thought
he
said
to
an
officer
that
there
was
a
lady
waiting
to
see
me
maria
black
he
added
seeing
that
the
officer
did
not
understand
the
policeman
roared
and
could
not
help
putting
his
head
in
at
the
office
door
to
tell
the
joke
well
you
must
introduce
him
called
a
voice
from
within
guess
you
got
the
name
exactly
straight
young
man
said
the
policeman
to
lemuel
as
he
guarded
him
down
the
steps
it
black
maria
you
looking
for
there
she
is
he
continued
pointing
to
the
omnibus
and
do
you
forget
it
she
particular
to
have
folks
recognise
her
she
blacker
she
the
omnibus
was
in
fact
a
sort
of
aesthetic
drab
relieved
with
salmon
as
lemuel
had
time
to
notice
before
he
was
hustled
into
it
with
the
other
prisoners
and
locked
in
there
were
already
several
there
and
as
lemuel
eyes
accustomed
themselves
to
the
light
that
came
in
through
the
little
panes
at
the
sides
of
the
roof
he
could
see
that
they
were
women
and
by
and
by
he
saw
that
two
of
them
were
the
saucy
girls
who
had
driven
him
from
his
seat
in
the
common
that
day
and
laughed
so
at
him
they
knew
him
too
and
one
of
them
set
up
a
shrill
laugh
hello
johnny
that
you
you
do
say
so
what
you
up
for
time
going
down
to
the
island
well
give
us
a
call
there
do
be
sociable
ward
the
the
other
one
laughed
and
then
swore
at
the
first
for
trying
to
push
her
off
the
seat
lemuel
broke
out
involuntarily
in
all
the
severity
that
was
native
to
him
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
this
convulsed
the
bold
things
with
laughter
when
they
could
get
their
breath
one
of
them
said
pshaw
i
know
what
he
up
for
preaching
on
the
common
say
young
feller
do
you
want
to
hold
a
here
they
burst
into
another
shriek
of
laughter
so
wild
and
shrill
that
the
driver
rapped
on
the
roof
and
called
down
dry
up
in
there
oh
you
mind
your
horses
and
we
look
after
the
passengers
go
and
set
on
his
knee

and
cheer
him
up
a
lemuel
sat
in
a
quiver
of
abhorrence
the
girl
appealed
to
remained
giggling
beside
her
companion
i
i
pity
ye
said
lemuel
the
irishwoman
had
not
stopped
bewailing
herself
and
imploring
right
and
left
an
easy
doom
she
now
addressed
herself
wholly
to
lemuel
whose
personal
dignity
seemed
to
clothe
him
with
authority
in
her
eyes
she
told
him
about
her
children
left
alone
with
no
one
to
look
after
them
the
two
little
girls
the
boy
only
three
years
old
when
the
van
stopped
at
a
station
to
take
in
more
passengers
she
tried
to
get
out
to
tell
the
gentlemen
at
the
office
about
it
she
said
after
several
of
these
halts
they
stopped
at
the
basement
of
a
large
stone
building
that
had
a
wide
flight
of
steps
in
front
and
columns
like
the
church
at
willoughby
pastures
only
the
church
steps
were
wood
and
the
columns
painted
pine
here
more
officers
took
charge
of
them
and
put
them
in
a
room
where
there
were
already
or
thirty
other
prisoners
the
harvest
of
the
night
before
and
presently
another
was
brought
in
there
were
many
women
among
them
but
here
there
was
no
laughing
or
joking
as
there
had
been
in
the
van
scarcely
any
one
spoke
except
the
irishwoman
who
crept
up
to
an
officer
at
the
door
from
time
to
time
and
begged
him
to
tell
the
judge
to
let
her
have
it
easy
this
time
lemuel
could
not
help
seeing
that
she
and
most
of
the
others
were
familiar
with
the
place
those
two
saucy
jades
who
had
mocked
him
were
silent
and
had
lost
their
bold
looks
after
waiting
what
seemed
a
long
time
the
door
was
opened
and
they
were
driven
up
a
flight
of
stairs
into
a
railed
enclosure
at
the
corner
of
a
large
room
where
they
remained
huddled
together
while
a
man
at
a
long
desk
rattled
over
something
that
ended
with
god
bless
the
commonwealth
of
on
a
platform
behind
the
speaker
sat
a
man
in
spectacles
and
lemuel
knew
that
he
was
in
the
and
that
this
must
be
the
judge
he
could
not
see
much
of
the
room
over
the
top
of
the
railing
but
there
was
a
buzz
of
voices
and
a
stir
of
feet
beyond
that
made
him
think
the
place
was
full
but
full
or
empty
it
was
the
same
to
him
his
shame
could
not
be
greater
or
less
he
waited
apathetically
while
the
clerk
read
off
the
charges
against
the
vastly
greater
number
of
his
arrested
for
drunkenness
when
these
were
disposed
of
he
read
from
the
back
of
a
paper
which
he
took
from
a
fresh
pile
bridget
gallagher
complained
of
for
habitual
drunkenness
guilty
or
not
guilty
not
guilty
your
honour
answered
the
irishwoman
who
had
come
from
lemuel
station
but
make
it
aisy
for
me
this
time
judge
and
never
catch
me
in
it
again
i
three
helpless
childer
at
home
your
honour
starvin
and
cryin
for
their
mother
holy
mary
make
it
aisy
judge
a
laugh
went
round
the
room
which
a
stern
voice
checked
with
silence
there
but
which
renewed
itself
when
the
old
woman
took
the
stand
at
the
end
of
the
clerk
long
desk
while
a
policeman
mounted
a
similar
platform
outside
the
rail
and
gave
his
testimony
against
her
it
was
very
conclusive
and
it
was
not
affected
by
the
denials
with
which
the
poor
woman
gave
herself
away
more
and
more
she
had
nothing
to
say
when
invited
to
do
so
except
to
beg
for
mercy
the
judge
made
a
few
inquiries
apparently
casual
of
the
policeman
then
after
a
silence
in
which
he
sat
rubbing
his
chin
he
leaned
forward
and
said
quietly
to
the
clerk
give
her
three
the
woman
gave
a
wild
irish
cry
o
my
poor
childer
and
amidst
the
amusement
of
the
spectators
which
the
constables
could
not
check
at
once
was
led
wailing
below
before
lemuel
could
get
his
breath
those
bold
girls
one
after
the
other
were
put
upon
the
stand
the
charge
against
them
was
not
made
the
subject
of
public
investigation
the
judge
and
some
other
elderly
gentleman
talked
it
over
together
and
the
girls
who
had
each
wept
in
pleading
guilty
were
put
on
probation
as
lemuel
understood
it
and
weeping
still
and
bridling
a
little
were
left
in
charge
of
this
elderly
gentleman
and
lemuel
saw
them
no
more
one
case
followed
another
and
lemuel
listened
with
the
fascination
of
terror
the
sentences
seemed
terribly
severe
and
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
offences
suddenly
his
own
name
was
called
his
name
had
been
called
in
public
places
before
at
the
school
exhibitions
where
he
had
taken
prizes
in
elocution
and
composition
in
church
once
when
the
minister
had
mentioned
him
for
peculiar
efficiency
and
zeal
among
other
teachers
it
was
sacred
to
him
for
his
father
sake
who
fell
in
the
war
and
who
was
recorded
in
it
on
the
ugly
pathetic
monument
on
the
village
green
and
hitherto
he
had
made
it
respected
and
even
honoured
and
had
tried
all
the
harder
to
keep
it
so
because
his
family
was
poor
and
his
mother
had
such
queer
ways
and
dressed
so
he
dragged
himself
to
the
stand
which
he
knew
he
must
mount
and
stole
from
under
his
eyelashes
a
glance
at
the
which
took
it
all
in
there
were
some
people
whom
he
did
not
know
for
reporters
busy
with
their
pencils
next
the
railings
and
there
was
a
semicircular
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
at
which
a
large
number
of
policemen
sat
and
they
had
their
straw
helmets
piled
upon
it
with
the
hats
of
the
lawyers
who
sat
among
them
beyond
the
seats
which
covered
the
floor
were
filled
with
the
sodden
loafers
whom
the
law
offers
every
morning
the
best
dramatic
amusement
in
the
city
presently
among
the
stupid
eyes
fixed
upon
him
lemuel
was
aware
of
the
eyes
of
that
fellow
who
had
passed
the
counterfeit
money
on
him
and
when
this
scamp
got
up
and
coolly
sauntered
out
of
the
room
lemuel
was
held
in
such
a
spell
that
he
did
not
hear
the
charge
read
against
him
or
the
clerk
repeated
demand
guilty
or
not
guilty
he
was
recalled
to
himself
by
the
voice
of
the
judge
young
man
do
you
understand
are
you
guilty
of
assaulting
this
lady
and
taking
her
satchel
or
not
not
guilty
said
lemuel
huskily
and
he
looked
not
at
the
judge
but
at
the
pretty
girl
who
confronted
him
from
a
stand
at
the
other
end
of
the
clerk
desk
blushing
to
find
herself
there
up
to
her
blue
eyes
lemuel
blushed
too
and
dropped
his
eyes
and
it
seemed
to
him
in
a
crazy
kind
of
way
that
it
was
impolite
to
have
pleaded
not
guilty
against
her
accusation
he
stood
waiting
for
the
testimony
which
the
judge
had
to
prompt
her
to
offer
state
the
facts
in
regard
to
the
assault
he
said
gravely
i
do
know
as
i
can
do
it
very
well
began
the
girl
we
shall
be
satisfied
if
you
do
your
best
said
the
judge
with
the
glimmer
of
a
smile
which
spread
to
a
laugh
among
the
spectators
unrebuked
by
the
constables
since
the
judge
had
invited
it
in
this
atmosphere
of
sympathy
the
girl
found
her
tongue
and
with
a
confiding
twist
of
her
pretty
head
began
again
well
now
i
tell
you
just
how
it
was
i
just
got
my
book
out
of
the
public
library
and
i
was
going
down
neponset
street
on
my
way
home
hurrying
along
because
i
see
it
was
beginning
to
be
pretty
late
and
the
first
thing
i
know
somebody
pulled
my
hat
down
over
my
eyes
and
tore
the
brim
half
off
so
i
do
suppose
i
can
ever
wear
it
again
it
such
a
lookin
thing
any
rate
it
ai
the
one
i
got
on
though
it
some
like
it
and
then
the
next
thing
somebody
grabbed
away
the
satchel
i
got
on
my
arm
and
as
soon
as
i
could
get
my
eyes
clear
again
i
see
two
fellows
chasin
up
the
street
and
i
told
the
officer
somebody
got
my
book
and
i
knew
it
was
one
of
those
fellows
runnin
away
and
i
said
they
go
now
and
the
officer
caught
the
hind
one
and
i
guess
the
other
one
got
away
and
the
officer
told
me
to
follow
along
to
the
and
when
we
got
there
they
took
my
name
and
where
i
roomed
and
my
age
do
you
recognise
this
young
man
as
one
of
the
persons
who
robbed
you
interrupted
the
judge
nodding
his
head
toward
lemuel
who
now
lifted
his
head
and
looked
his
accuser
fearlessly
in
her
pretty
eyes
why
no
she
promptly
replied
the
first
thing
i
knew
he
pulled
my
hat
over
my
but
you
recognise
him
as
one
of
those
you
saw
running
away
oh
yes
he
one
of
said
the
girl
what
made
you
think
he
had
robbed
you
why
because
my
satchel
was
gone
returned
the
girl
with
logic
that
apparently
amused
the
gentlemen
of
the
bar
but
why
did
you
think
had
taken
it
because
i
see
him
running
you
could
swear
that
he
was
the
one
who
took
your
satchel
why
of
course
not
i
did
him
till
i
saw
him
running
and
i
do
know
as
he
was
the
one
now
added
the
girl
in
a
sudden
burst
of
generosity
and
if
it
was
to
do
over
again
i
should
say
as
much
to
the
officers
at
the
station
but
i
got
confused
when
they
commenced
askin
me
who
i
was
and
how
much
i
weighed
and
what
my
height
was
and
did
say
anything
and
i
got
to
thinkin
may
be
it
and
when
they
told
me
that
if
i
did
promise
to
appear
at
court
in
the
morning
they
have
to
lock
me
up
i
was
only
too
glad
to
get
away
by
this
time
all
the
blackguard
audience
were
sharing
unchecked
the
amusement
of
the
bar
the
judge
put
up
his
hand
to
hide
a
laugh
then
he
said
to
lemuel
do
you
wish
to
question
the
plaintiff
the
two
young
things
looked
at
each
other
and
both
blushed
no
said
lemuel
the
girl
looked
at
the
judge
for
permission
and
at
a
nod
from
him
left
the
stand
and
sat
down
the
officer
who
had
arrested
lemuel
took
the
stand
on
the
other
side
of
the
rail
from
him
and
corroborated
the
girl
story
but
he
had
not
seen
the
assault
or
robbery
and
could
not
swear
to
either
then
lemuel
was
invited
to
speak
and
told
his
story
with
the
sort
of
nervous
courage
that
came
to
him
in
extremity
he
told
it
from
the
beginning
and
his
adventure
with
the
two
beats
in
the
common
made
the
audience
laugh
again
even
then
lemuel
could
not
see
the
fun
of
it
he
stopped
and
the
stout
ushers
in
blue
flannel
sacks
commanded
silence
then
lemuel
related
how
he
had
twice
seen
one
of
the
beats
since
that
time
but
he
was
ashamed
to
say
how
he
had
let
him
escape
out
of
that
very
room
half
an
hour
before
he
told
how
he
had
found
the
beat
in
the
crowd
before
the
saloon
and
how
he
was
chasing
him
up
the
street
when
he
heard
the
young
lady
hollo
out
there
they
go
now
and
then
the
officer
arrested
him
the
judge
sat
a
moment
in
thought
then
said
quietly
the
charge
is
dismissed
and
before
lemuel
well
knew
what
it
meant
a
gate
was
opened
at
the
stand
and
he
was
invited
to
pass
out
he
was
free
the
officer
who
had
arrested
him
shook
his
hand
in
congratulation
and
excuse
and
the
lawyers
and
the
other
policemen
gave
him
a
friendly
glance
the
loafers
and
beats
of
the
audience
did
not
seem
to
notice
him
they
were
already
intent
upon
a
case
of
coloured
assault
and
battery
which
had
been
called
and
which
opened
with
the
promise
of
uncommon
richness
both
of
the
parties
being
women
lemuel
saw
that
girl
who
had
accused
him
passing
down
the
aisle
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
she
was
with
another
girl
who
looked
older
lemuel
walked
fast
to
get
out
of
their
way
he
did
not
know
why
but
he
did
not
want
to
speak
to
the
girl
they
walked
fast
too
and
when
he
got
down
the
stairs
on
to
the
ground
floor
of
the
courthouse
they
overtook
him
say
said
the
older
girl
i
want
to
speak
to
i
think
it
a
down
shame
the
way
that
you
been
treated
and
statira
she
feels
jus
i
do
about
it
and
i
tell
her
she
got
to
say

the
least

do
i
tell
her
after
what
she
got
you
for
my
grier
i
room
i
come
her
this
mornin
t
help
keep
her
up
i
know
was
goin
to
be
a
as
the
young
woman
rattled
on
she
grew
more
and
more
glib
she
was
what
they
call
and
spoke
a
language
almost
purely
consonantal
cutting
and
clipping
her
words
with
a
rapid
play
of
her
till
there
was
nothing
but
the
bare
bones
left
of
them
statira
was
crying
and
lemuel
could
not
bear
to
see
her
cry
he
tried
to
say
something
to
comfort
her
but
all
he
could
think
of
was
i
hope
you
get
your
book
back
and
grier
answered
for
her
oh
i
guess
ai
the
book
she
cares
for
s
far
forth
the
book
goes
i
guess
she
can
afford
to
buy
another
book
well
enough
i
tell
her
she
done
awful
thing
and
a
thing
she
carry
to
her
grave
her
she
remember
to
her
dyin
day
that
what
tell
she
got
any
call
to
feel
bad
about
it
said
lemuel
clumsily
it
was
just
a
then
not
knowing
what
more
to
say
he
said
being
come
to
the
outer
door
by
this
time
well
i
wish
you
good
well
good
morning
said
grier
and
she
thrust
her
elbow
sharply
into
statira
dudley
side
so
that
she
also
said
faintly
well
good
morning
she
was
fluent
enough
on
the
and
in
the
police
station
but
now
she
could
not
find
a
word
to
say
the
three
stood
together
on
the
threshold
of
the
not
knowing
how
to
get
away
from
one
another
grier
put
out
her
hand
to
lemuel
he
took
it
and
well
good
morning
he
said
again
well
good
morning
repeated
grier
then
statira
put
out
her
hand
and
she
and
lemuel
shook
hands
and
said
together
well
good
morning
and
on
these
terms
of
high
civility
they
parted
he
went
one
way
and
they
another
he
did
not
look
back
but
the
two
girls
marching
off
with
locked
arms
and
flying
tongues
when
they
came
to
the
corner
turned
to
look
back
they
both
turned
inward
and
so
bumped
their
heads
together
why
you
coot
cried
grier
and
they
broke
out
laughing
lemuel
heard
their
laugh
and
he
knew
they
were
laughing
at
him
but
he
did
not
care
he
wandered
on
he
did
not
know
whither
and
presently
he
came
to
the
only
place
he
could
remember
vii
the
place
was
the
common
where
his
trouble
had
begun
he
looked
back
to
the
beginning
and
could
see
that
it
was
his
own
fault
to
be
sure
you
might
say
that
if
a
fellow
came
along
and
offered
to
pay
you
fifty
cents
for
changing
a
bill
you
had
a
right
to
take
it
but
there
was
a
voice
in
lemuel
heart
which
warned
him
that
greed
to
hurt
was
sin
and
that
if
you
took
too
much
for
a
thing
from
a
necessitous
person
you
oppressed
and
robbed
him
you
could
make
it
appear
otherwise
but
you
could
not
really
change
the
nature
of
the
act
he
owned
this
with
a
sigh
and
he
owned
himself
justly
punished
he
was
still
on
those
terms
of
personal
understanding
with
the
eternal
spirit
of
right
which
most
of
us
lose
later
in
life
when
we
have
so
often
seemed
to
see
the
effect
fail
to
follow
the
cause
both
in
the
case
of
our
own
misdeeds
and
the
misdeeds
of
others
he
sat
down
on
a
bench
and
he
sat
there
all
day
except
when
he
went
to
drink
from
the
tin
cup
dangling
by
the
chain
from
the
nearest
fountain
his
good
breakfast
kept
him
from
being
hungry
for
a
while
but
he
was
as
aimless
and
as
hopeless
as
ever
and
as
destitute
he
would
have
gone
home
now
if
he
had
had
the
money
he
was
afraid
they
would
be
getting
anxious
about
him
there
though
he
had
not
made
any
particular
promises
about
the
time
of
returning
he
had
dropped
a
postal
card
into
a
box
as
soon
as
he
reached
boston
to
tell
of
his
safe
arrival
and
they
would
not
expect
him
to
write
again
there
were
only
two
ways
for
him
to
get
home
to
turn
tramp
and
walk
back
or
to
go
to
that
sewell
and
borrow
the
money
to
pay
his
passage
to
walk
home
would
add
intolerably
to
the
public
shame
he
must
suffer
and
the
thought
of
going
to
sewell
was
even
in
the
secret
which
it
would
remain
between
him
and
the
minister
a
pang
so
cruel
to
his
pride
that
he
recoiled
from
it
instantly
he
said
to
himself
he
would
stand
it
one
day
more
something
might
happen
and
if
nothing
happened
he
should
think
of
it
again
in
the
meantime
he
thought
of
other
things
of
that
girl
among
the
rest
and
how
she
looked
at
the
different
times
as
nearly
as
he
could
make
out
she
seemed
to
be
a
very
fashionable
girl
at
any
rate
she
was
dressed
fashionably
and
she
was
he
did
not
know
whether
she
had
behaved
very
sensibly
but
he
presumed
she
was
some
excited
toward
dark
when
lemuel
was
reconciling
himself
to
another
sleep
in
the
open
air
a
policeman
sauntered
along
the
mall
and
as
he
drew
nearer
the
boy
recognised
his
friendly
captor
he
dropped
his
head
but
it
was
too
late
the
officer
knew
him
and
stopped
before
him
well
he
said
hard
at
it
i
lemuel
made
no
answer
but
he
was
aware
of
a
friendly
look
in
the
officer
face
mixed
with
fatherly
severity
i
was
in
hopes
you
had
started
back
to
willoughby
pastures
before
this
you
do
want
to
get
into
the
habit
of
settin
round
on
the
common
much
first
thing
you
know
you
ca
quit
it
where
you
goin
to
put
up
i
do
know
murmured
lemuel
got
no
friends
in
town
you
can
go
to
well
now
look
here
do
you
think
you
could
find
your
way
back
to
the
station
i
guess
so
said
lemuel
looking
up
at
the
officer
questioningly
well
when
you
get
tired
of
this
you
come
round
and
we
provide
a
bed
for
you
and
you
get
back
home
quick
as
you
thank
you
said
lemuel
he
was
helpless
against
the
advice
and
its
unjust
implication
but
he
could
not
say
anything
get
out
o
boston
anyway
wherever
you
go
or
do
go
continued
the
officer
it
a
bad
he
walked
on
and
left
lemuel
to
himself
again
he
thought
bitterly
that
no
one
knew
better
than
himself
how
luridly
wicked
boston
was
and
that
there
was
probably
not
a
soul
in
it
more
helplessly
anxious
to
get
out
of
it
he
thought
it
hard
to
be
talked
to
as
if
it
were
his
fault
as
if
he
wished
to
become
a
vagrant
and
a
beggar
he
sat
there
an
hour
or
two
longer
and
then
he
took
the
officer
advice
so
far
as
concerned
his
going
to
the
station
for
a
bed
swallowing
his
pride
as
he
must
he
must
do
that
or
he
must
go
to
sewell
it
was
easier
to
accept
humiliation
at
the
hands
of
strangers
he
found
his
way
there
with
some
difficulty
and
slinking
in
at
the
front
door
he
waited
at
the
threshold
of
the
captain
room
while
he
and
two
or
three
officers
disposed
of
a
respectably
dressed
man
whom
a
policeman
was
holding
up
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
they
were
searching
his
pockets
and
taking
away
his
money
his
keys
and
his
pencil
and
penknife
which
the
captain
sealed
up
in
a
large
envelope
and
put
into
his
desk
there
take
him
and
lock
him
up
he
pretty
well
loaded
said
the
captain
then
he
looked
up
and
saw
lemuel
hello
ca
keep
away
eh
he
demanded
jocosely
well
we
heard
about
you
i
told
you
the
judge
would
make
it
all
right
what
wanted
bed
well
here
the
captain
filled
up
a
blank
which
he
took
from
a
and
gave
it
to
lemuel
i
guess
that
fix
you
out
for
the
night
and
tomorrow
you
put
back
to
willoughby
pastures
tight
as
you
can
get
there
you
on
the
wrong
track
now
first
thing
you
know
you
be
a
professional
tramp
and
then
you
wo
be
worth
the
powder
to
blow
you
i
use
plain
talk
with
you
because
you
a
beginner
i
would
waste
my
breath
on
that
fellow
behind
lemuel
looked
round
and
almost
touched
with
his
a
face
that
shone
fiery
red
through
the
rusty
growth
of
a
week
beard
and
recoiled
from
a
figure
that
was
fouler
as
to
shirt
and
coat
and
trousers
than
anything
the
boy
had
seen
though
the
tramps
used
to
swarm
through
willoughby
pastures
before
the
selectmen
began
to
lock
them
up
in
the
town
poorhouse
and
set
them
to
breaking
stone
there
was
no
ferocity
in
the
loathsome
face
it
was
a
vagrant
swine
that
looked
from
it
no
worse
in
its
present
mood
than
greedy
and
sleepy
bed
demanded
the
captain
writing
another
blank
never
been
here
before
i
suppose
he
continued
with
irony
i
do
seem
to
remember
the
captain
laughed
and
the
tramp
returned
a
husky
thank
you
sir
and
took
himself
off
into
the
street
then
the
captain
came
to
lemuel
help
you
follow
him
he
said
and
you
come
to
a
bed
by
and
he
went
out
and
since
he
could
do
no
better
did
as
he
was
bid
he
had
hardly
ever
seen
a
drunken
man
at
willoughby
pastures
where
the
prohibition
law
was
strictly
enforced
there
was
no
such
person
as
a
thief
in
the
whole
community
and
the
tramps
were
gone
long
ago
yet
here
was
he
famed
at
home
for
the
rectitude
of
his
life
and
the
loftiness
of
his
aims
consorting
with
drunkards
and
thieves
and
tramps
and
warned
against
what
he
was
doing
by
a
policeman
as
if
he
was
doing
it
of
his
own
will
it
was
very
strange
business
if
it
was
all
a
punishment
for
taking
that
fellow
it
was
pretty
heavy
punishment
he
was
not
going
to
say
that
it
was
unjust
but
he
would
say
it
was
hard
his
spirit
was
now
so
bruised
and
broken
that
he
hardly
knew
what
to
think
he
followed
the
tramp
as
far
off
as
he
could
and
still
keep
him
in
sight
and
he
sometimes
thought
he
had
lost
him
in
the
streets
that
climbed
and
crooked
beyond
the
common
towards
the
quarter
whither
they
were
going
but
he
reappeared
slouching
and
shambling
rapidly
on
in
the
glare
of
some
electric
lights
that
stamped
the
ground
with
shadows
thick
and
black
as
if
cut
in
velvet
or
burnt
into
the
surface
here
and
there
some
girl
brushed
against
the
boy
and
gave
him
a
joking
or
jeering
word
her
face
flashed
into
light
for
a
moment
and
then
vanished
in
the
darkness
she
passed
into
it
was
that
hot
october
and
the
night
was
close
and
still
on
the
steps
of
some
of
the
houses
groups
of
fat
weary
women
were
sitting
and
children
were
playing
on
the
sidewalks
using
the
for
goal
or
tag
the
tramp
ahead
of
lemuel
issued
upon
a
brilliantly
lighted
little
square
with
a
great
many
coming
and
going
in
it
a
church
with
stores
on
the
ground
floor
and
fronting
it
on
one
side
a
row
of
handsome
old
stone
houses
with
iron
fences
and
on
another
a
great
hotel
with
a
portico
where
men
sat
talking
and
smoking
people
were
waiting
on
the
sidewalk
to
take
the
cars
a
window
threw
its
mellow
lights
into
the
street
from
open
cellarways
came
the
sound
of
banjos
and
violins
at
one
of
these
cellar
doors
his
guide
lingered
so
long
that
lemuel
thought
he
should
have
to
find
the
way
beyond
for
himself
but
the
tramp
suddenly
commanded
himself
from
the
music
the
light
and
the
smell
of
strong
drink
which
lemuel
caught
a
whiff
of
as
he
followed
and
turning
a
corner
led
the
way
to
the
side
of
a
lofty
building
in
a
dark
street
where
they
met
other
like
shapes
tending
toward
it
from
different
directions
viii
lemuel
entered
a
lighted
doorway
from
a
bricked
courtyard
and
found
himself
with
twenty
or
thirty
houseless
comrades
in
a
large
square
room
with
benching
against
the
wall
for
them
to
sit
on
they
were
all
silent
and
except
a
young
fellow
whom
lemuel
sat
down
beside
and
who
ascertaining
that
he
was
a
seemed
disposed
to
do
the
honours
of
the
place
he
was
not
daunted
by
the
reserve
native
to
lemuel
or
by
that
distrust
of
strangers
which
experience
had
so
soon
taught
him
he
addressed
him
promptly
as
mate
and
told
him
that
the
high
narrow
tabling
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
where
they
would
get
their
breakfast
if
they
lived
and
i
guess
i
shall
live
he
said
i
notice
i
always
live
till
whatever
else
i
do
or
i
do
do
but
sometimes
it
do
seem
as
if
i
saw
my
way
through
that
quarter
of
a
cord
of
at
a
glance
of
inquiry
which
lemuel
could
not
forbear
he
continued
what
i
mean
by
a
quarter
of
a
cord
of
wood
is
that
they
let
you
exercise
that
much
free
in
the
morning
before
they
give
you
your
breakfast
it
the
doctor
orders
this
used
to
be
a
but
it
in
better
business
now
they
got
a
kitchen
under
here
that
beats
the
parker
house
you
smell
it
pretty
soon
no
whacking
on
the
knuckles
here
any
more
all
serene
i
tell
you
you
see
i
do
know
how
i
should
got
along
without
this
institution
and
i
tell
the
manager
so
every
time
i
see
him
that
him
hollering
out
of
that
room
there
it
a
name
he
gives
all
of
us
he
knows
it
a
name
we
answer
to
do
you
forget
it
when
it
comes
your
he
was
younger
than
lemuel
apparently
but
his
swarthy
droll
eyed
face
affirmed
the
experience
of
a
sage
he
wore
a
blue
flannel
shirt
with
loose
trousers
belted
round
his
waist
and
he
crushed
a
soft
felt
hat
between
his
hands
his
hair
was
clipped
close
to
his
skull
and
as
he
rubbed
it
now
and
then
it
gave
out
a
pleasant
rasping
sound
the
tramps
disappeared
in
the
order
of
their
vicinity
to
the
door
and
it
came
in
time
to
this
boy
and
lemuel
you
come
along
with
me
he
said
and
do
as
i
when
they
entered
the
presence
of
the
manager
who
sat
at
a
desk
lemuel
guide
nodded
to
him
and
handed
over
his
order
for
a
bed
ever
been
here
before
asked
the
manager
as
if
going
through
the
form
for
a
joke
he
took
a
numbered
card
which
the
manager
gave
him
and
stood
aside
to
wait
for
lemuel
who
made
the
same
answer
to
the
same
question
and
received
his
numbered
card
now
said
the
young
fellow
as
they
passed
out
of
another
door
we
ai
either
of
us
any
more
i
and
forty
and
do
you
forget
it
all
right
boss
he
called
back
to
the
manager
i
take
care
of
him
this
way
he
said
to
lemuel
the
reason
why
i
said
i
never
been
here
before
he
explained
on
the
way
down
was
because
you
got
to
say
something
when
he
asks
you
most
of
says
last
fall
or
last
year
but
i
say
never
because
it
just
as
true
and
he
seems
to
like
it
better
we
going
down
to
the
now
and
then
we
going
to
take
a
bath
do
you
know
why
no
said
lemuel
because
we
ca
help
it
it
the
doctor
orders
he
thinks
it
the
best
thing
you
can
do
just
before
you
go
to
the
basement
was
brightly
lighted
with
gas
everywhere
and
a
savoury
odour
of
broth
diffused
itself
through
the
whole
place
smell
it
you
might
think
that
was
supper
but
it
ai
breakfast
you
got
a
bath
and
a
night
rest
as
well
as
the
quarter
of
a
cord
of
wood
between
you
and
that
stew
hungry
not
very
said
lemuel
faintly
because
if
you
say
you
are
they
give
you
all
the
bread
and
water
you
can
hold
now
but
i
ruther
i
guess
i
do
want
anything
said
lemuel
shrinking
from
the
act
of
beggary
well
i
guess
you
wo
lose
anything
in
the
long
run
said
the
other
you
make
it
up
at
they
turned
into
a
room
where
eight
or
ten
tramps
were
undressing
some
of
them
were
old
men
quite
sodden
and
stupefied
with
a
life
of
vagrancy
and
privation
others
were
of
a
dull
or
cunning
two
or
three
were
as
young
as
lemuel
and
his
partner
and
looked
as
if
they
might
be
poor
fellows
who
had
found
themselves
in
a
strange
city
without
money
or
work
but
it
was
against
them
that
they
had
known
where
to
come
for
a
night
shelter
lemuel
felt
there
were
large
iron
hooks
hanging
from
the
walls
and
ceiling
and
his
friend
found
the
numbers
on
two
of
them
corresponding
to
those
given
lemuel
and
himself
and
brass
checks
which
they
hung
around
their
necks
you
got
to
hang
your
things
on
that
hook
all
but
your
shoes
and
stockings
and
you
got
to
hang
on
to
yourself
forty
your
number
and
forty
your
hook
and
they
give
you
the
clothes
it
in
the
he
led
the
way
through
the
corridor
into
a
large
room
where
a
row
of
flanked
the
wall
half
of
them
filled
with
bathers
who
chatted
in
tones
of
subdued
cheerfulness
under
the
pleasant
excitement
of
unlimited
hot
and
cold
water
as
each
appeared
a
black
boy
perched
on
a
windowsill
jumped
down
and
dashed
his
head
from
a
large
bottle
which
he
carried
free
shampoo
explained
lemuel
mate
doctor
orders
only
you
have
to
do
the
rubbing
yourself
i
do
suppose
need
it
but
some
the
pardners
here
could
sleep
without
it
he
continued
as
lemuel
shrank
a
little
from
the
bottle
and
then
submitted
it
a
regular
the
tramps
recognised
the
humour
of
the
explanation
by
a
laugh
intended
to
be
respectful
to
the
establishment
in
its
control
which
spread
along
their
line
and
the
black
boy
grinned
there
ai
anything
mean
about
the
wayfarer
hotel
said
the
mate
and
they
all
laughed
again
a
little
louder
each
man
having
dried
himself
from
his
bath
was
given
a
coarse
linen
sometimes
it
was
not
quite
whole
but
it
was
always
clean
and
then
he
gathered
up
his
shoes
and
stockings
and
went
out
hold
on
a
minute
said
the
mate
to
lemuel
when
they
left
the
you
ought
to
see
the
kitchen
and
in
his
with
his
shoes
in
his
hand
he
led
lemuel
to
the
open
door
which
that
delicious
smell
of
broth
came
from
a
vast
boiler
was
bubbling
within
and
trying
to
get
its
lid
off

by
the
women
at
the

street
home
oh
i
tell
you
we
do
things
in
style
a
man
who
sat
reading
a
newspaper
in
the
corner
looked
up
sharply
hello
there
what
wanted
just
dropped
in
to
wish
you
good
night
jimmy
said
lemuel
mate
you
clear
out
said
the
man
as
if
to
an
old
acquaintance
who
must
not
be
allowed
to
presume
upon
his
familiarity
all
right
jimmy
said
the
boy
he
set
his
left
hand
horizontally
on
its
wrist
at
his
left
shoulder
and
cut
the
air
with
it
in
playful
menace
as
the
man
dropped
his
eyes
again
to
his
paper
they
all
just
so
in
this
house
he
explained
to
lemuel
no
nonsense
but
all
right
they
know
he
mounted
two
flights
of
stairs
in
front
of
lemuel
to
a
corridor
where
an
attendant
stood
examining
the
numbers
on
the
brass
checks
hung
around
tramps
necks
as
they
came
up
with
their
shoes
in
their
hands
he
instructed
them
that
the
numbers
corresponded
to
the
cots
they
were
to
occupy
as
well
as
the
hooks
where
their
clothes
hung
some
of
them
seemed
hardly
able
to
master
the
facts
they
looked
wistfully
like
cowed
animals
into
his
face
as
he
made
the
case
clear
two
vast
rooms
exquisitely
clean
like
the
whole
house
opened
on
the
right
and
left
of
the
corridor
and
presented
long
phalanxes
of
cots
each
furnished
with
two
coarse
blankets
a
quilt
and
a
thin
pillow
used
to
be
said
lemuel
mate
in
a
low
tone
cots
and
forty
said
the
attendant
looking
at
their
checks
right
over
there
in
the
come
along
said
the
mate
leading
the
way
with
the
satisfaction
of
an
best
berth
in
the
room
and
about
the
last
they
reach
in
the
morning
you
see
they
got
to
take
us
as
we
come
when
they
call
us
and
the
last
feller
in
at
night
the
first
feller
out
in
the
morning
because
his
bed
the
nearest
the
he
did
not
pull
down
the
blankets
of
his
cot
at
once
but
stretched
himself
out
in
the
quilt
that
covered
them
cool
off
a
little
first
he
explained
well
this
is
what
i
call
comfort
mate
heigh
lemuel
did
not
answer
he
was
watching
the
attendant
with
a
group
of
tramps
who
could
not
find
their
cots
ca
read
i
suppose
said
the
mate
a
little
disdainfully
well
look
at
that
old
chap
will
you
a
poor
fellow
was
fumbling
with
his
blankets
as
if
he
did
not
know
quite
how
to
manage
them
the
attendant
had
to
come
to
his
help
and
tuck
him
in
well
there
exclaimed
the
mate
lifting
himself
on
his
elbow
to
admire
the
scene
i
do
suppose
he
ever
been
in
a
decent
bed
before
hayloft
style
or
a
he
sank
down
again
and
went
on
well
you
do
see
all
kinds
of
folks
here
that
a
fact
sorry
there
ai
more
in
so
to
give
you
a
specimen
you
ought
to
be
here
in
the
winter
well
it
ai
so
lonesome
now
in
summer
as
it
used
to
be
sometimes
i
used
to
have
nearly
the
whole
place
to
myself
summer
nights
before
they
got
to
passin
these
laws
against
tramps
in
the
country
and
lockin
up
when
they
ketched
that
drives
into
the
city
summers
now
because
they
always
sure
of
a
night
rest
and
a
day
board
here
if
they
ask
for
it
but
winter
the
time
you
see
all
these
cots
full
then
they
let
on
the
and
it
comfortable
and
it
always
airy
and
the
vast
room
was
in
fact
perfectly
ventilated
and
the
poor
who
housed
themselves
that
night
and
many
sojourners
in
hotels
had
reason
to
envy
the
vagrants
their
free
lodging
the
mate
now
got
under
his
quilt
and
turned
his
face
toward
lemuel
with
one
hand
under
his
cheek
they
do
let
into
this
room
i
was
tellin
ye
this
room
is
for
the
you
know
sometimes
a
drunk
will
get
in
though
in
spite
of
everything
why
seen
a
drunk
at
the
when
i
been
gettin
my
order
for
a
bed
stiffen
up
so
the
captain
himself
thought
he
was
sober
and
then
i
followed
him
round
here
wobblin
and
corkscrewin
all
over
the
sidewalk
and
then
i
seen
him
stiffen
up
in
the
office
again
and
go
through
his
bath
like
a
little
man
and
get
into
bed
as
drunk
as
a
fish
and
may
be
wake
up
in
the
night
with
the
man
with
the
poker
after
him
and
make
things
hum
well
sir
one
night
there
was
a
drunk
in
here
that
thought
the
man
with
the
poker
was
after
him
and
he
just
up
and
jumped
out
of
this
window
behind
you
three
stories
from
the
lemuel
could
not
help
lifting
himself
in
bed
to
look
at
it
did
it
kill
him
he
asked
kill
him
you
ca
kill
a
one
night
there
was
a
drunk
got
loose
here
and
he
run
downstairs
into
the
and
he
got
hold
of
an
axe
down
there
and
it
took
five
men
to
get
that
axe
away
from
that
drunk
he
was
goin
for
the
the
snakes
repeated
lemuel
are
there
snakes
in
the
the
other
gave
a
laugh
so
loud
that
the
attendant
called
out
less
noise
over
there
i
tell
you
about
the
snakes
in
the
morning
said
the
mate
and
he
turned
his
face
away
from
lemuel
the
stories
of
the
drunks
had
made
lemuel
a
little
anxious
but
he
thought
that
attendant
would
keep
a
sharp
lookout
so
that
there
would
not
really
be
much
danger
he
was
very
drowsy
from
his
bath
in
spite
of
the
hunger
that
tormented
him
but
he
tried
to
keep
awake
and
think
what
he
should
do
after
breakfast
ix
come
turn
out
said
a
voice
in
his
ear
and
he
started
up
to
see
the
great
dormitory
where
he
had
fallen
asleep
empty
of
all
but
himself
and
his
friend
make
out
a
night
rest
asked
the
latter
did
i
tell
you
be
the
last
up
come
along
he
preceded
lemuel
still
drowsy
down
the
stairs
into
the
room
where
they
had
undressed
and
where
the
tramps
were
taking
each
his
clothes
from
their
hook
and
hustling
them
on
what
time
is
it
johnny
asked
lemuel
mate
of
the
attendant
i
left
my
watch
under
my
five
said
the
man
helping
the
poor
old
fellow
who
had
not
known
how
to
get
into
bed
to
put
on
his
clothes
well
that
a
pretty
good
start
said
the
other
he
finished
his
toilet
by
belting
himself
around
the
waist
and
come
along
mate
he
said
to
lemuel
i
show
you
the
way
to
the
he
led
him
through
the
corridor
into
a
chamber
of
the
basement
where
there
were
bright
rows
of
and
ranks
of
with
heaps
of
the
latter
in
different
stages
of
construction
house
as
far
as
it
can
we
do
want
to
be
beholden
to
anybody
if
we
can
help
it
we
make
our
own
horses
here
but
we
make
our
saws
or
we
would
ever
had
much
practice
with
the
woodsaw
no
said
lemuel
with
a
throb
of
that
brought
back
the
hacked
log
behind
the
house
and
the
axe
resting
against
it
we
always
chopped
our
yes
that
the
way
in
the
country
well
now
said
the
other
show
you
how
to
choose
a
saw
do
you
be
took
in
by
no
new
saw
because
it
bright
and
looks
pretty
you
want
to
take
a
saw
that
been
filed
and
filed
away
till
it
ai
more
an
inch
and
a
half
deep
and
then
you
want
to
tune
it
up
just
so
like
a
banjo
not
too
tight
and
not
too
slack
and
then
it
slip
through
a
stick
o
wood
like
he
selected
a
saw
and
put
it
in
order
for
lemuel
there
he
picked
out
another
here
old
he
took
up
a
at
random
to
indicate
that
one
need
not
be
critical
in
that
and
led
through
the
open
door
into
the
where
a
score
or
two
of
saws
were
already
shrilling
and
wheezing
through
the
wood
it
was
a
wide
and
lofty
shed
with
piles
of
and
slabs
at
either
end
and
walled
on
the
farther
side
with
kindling
sawed
split
and
piled
up
with
admirable
neatness
the
place
gave
out
the
sweet
smell
of
the
woods
from
the
bark
of
the
logs
and
from
the
fresh
section
of
their
grain
a
double
rank
of
occupied
the
middle
space
and
beside
each
horse
lay
a
quarter
of
a
cord
of
wood
at
which
the
men
were
toiling
in
sullen
silence
for
the
most
part
only
exchanging
a
grunt
or
snarl
of
dissatisfaction
with
one
another
morning
mates
said
lemuel
friend
cheerfully
as
he
entered
the
shed
and
put
his
horse
down
beside
one
of
the
piles
thought
we
look
in
and
see
how
you
was
gettin
along
just
stepped
round
from
the
parker
house
while
our
breakfast
was
hope
you
all
rested
well
the
men
paused
with
their
saws
at
different
slopes
in
the
wood
and
looked
round
the
night
before
in
the
nakedness
in
which
lemuel
had
first
seen
them
the
worst
of
them
had
the
inalienable
comeliness
of
nature
and
their
faces
softened
by
their
relation
to
their
bodies
were
not
so
bad
they
were
not
so
bad
looking
from
their
white
nightgowns
but
now
clad
in
their
filthy
rags
and
caricatured
out
of
all
native
dignity
by
their
motley
and
misshapen
attire
they
were
a
hideous
gang
and
all
the
more
hideous
for
the
grin
that
overspread
their
stubbly
muzzles
at
the
boy
persiflage
do
let
me
interrupt
you
fellows
he
said
flinging
a
log
upon
his
horse
and
dashing
his
saw
gaily
into
it
do
mind
i
know
you
hate
to
lose
a
minute
of
this
fun
i
understand
just
how
you
feel
about
it
and
i
do
want
you
to
stand
upon
ceremony
with
treat
me
just
like
one
of
yourselves
gents
this
beechwood
is
the
regular
nova
scotia
thing
ai
it
tough
and
knotty
i
ca
bear
any
of
your
cheap
stuff
from
around
here
what
i
want
is
nova
scotia
wood
every
time
then
i
feel
that
i
gettin
the
worth
of
my
his
log
dropped
apart
on
each
side
of
his
horse
and
he
put
on
another
well
mates
he
rattled
on
this
is
lovely
ai
it
i
would
give
up
my
little
quarter
of
a
cord
of
green
nova
scotia
before
breakfast
for
anything
i
got
into
the
way
of
it
and
i
ca
live
without
the
tramps
chuckled
at
these
ironies
and
the
attendant
who
looked
into
the
yard
now
and
then
did
not
interfere
with
them
the
mate
went
through
his
stint
as
rapidly
as
he
talked
and
he
had
nearly
finished
before
lemuel
had
half
done
he
did
not
offer
to
help
him
but
he
delayed
the
remnant
of
his
work
and
waited
for
him
to
catch
up
talking
all
the
while
with
gay
volubility
joking
this
one
and
that
and
keeping
the
whole
company
as
cheerful
as
it
was
in
their
dull
sodden
nature
to
be
he
had
a
floating
eye
that
harmonised
with
his
queer
mobile
face
and
played
round
on
the
different
figures
but
mostly
upon
lemuel
dogged
rustic
industry
as
if
it
really
amused
him
what
your
lay
after
breakfast
he
asked
as
they
came
to
the
last
log
together
lay
repeated
lemuel
what
you
goin
to
do
i
do
know
i
ca
tell
you
know
said
the
other
you
can
come
back
here
and
get
your
dinner
if
you
want
to
saw
wood
for
it
from
ten
till
twelve
and
you
get
your
supper
if
you
saw
from
five
to
are
you
going
to
do
that
asked
lemuel
cautiously
no

said
the
other
i
ca

the
time
i
goin
to
fill
up
for
all
day
at
breakfast
and
then
i
goin
up
to
lay
round
on
the
common
till
it
time
to
go
to
the
police
court
and
when
that
over
i
goin
back
to
the
common
and
lay
round
the
rest
of
the
day
i
hai
got
any
leisure
for
no
such
nonsense
as
i
do
mind
the
work
but
i
hate
to
waste
the
time
it
the
way
with
most
o
the
pardners
unless
it
the
green
hands
that
so
pards
some
of
them
had
already
gone
in
to
breakfast
the
smell
of
the
stew
came
out
to
the
through
the
open
door
lemuel
and
his
friend
finished
their
last
stick
at
the
same
time
and
went
in
together
and
found
places
side
by
side
at
the
table
in
the
the
attendant
within
its
oblong
was
serving
the
men
with
heavy
quart
bowls
of
the
steaming
broth
he
brought
half
a
loaf
of
light
elastic
bread
with
each
and
there
were
platters
of
set
along
the
board
which
every
one
helped
himself
from
freely
and
broke
into
his
broth
morning
jimmy
said
the
mate
as
the
man
brought
him
and
lemuel
their
portions
i
hate
to
have
the
chairs
off
a
paintin
when
there
so
much
style
about
everything
else
and
i
got
a
visitor
with
me
but
i
tell
him
he
have
to
take
us
as
he
finds
us
and
stand
it
this
he
wasted
no
more
words
on
his
joke
but
plunging
his
large
tin
spoon
into
his
bowl
kept
his
breath
to
cool
his
broth
blowing
upon
it
with
easy
grace
and
swallowing
it
at
a
tremendous
rate
though
lemuel
after
following
his
example
still
found
it
so
hot
that
it
brought
the
tears
into
his
eyes
it
was
delicious
and
he
was
ravenous
from
his
hours
fast
but
his
companion
was
scraping
the
bottom
of
his
bowl
before
lemuel
had
got
down
and
he
finished
his
second
as
lemuel
finished
his
first
just
oncet
more
for
both
of
us
jimmy
he
said
pushing
his
bowl
across
the
board
and
when
the
man
brought
them
back
he
said
now
goin
to
take
it
easy
and
enjoy
myself
i
ca
never
seem
to
get
the
good
of
it
till
about

third
or
fourth

bowls
gasped
lemuel
in
astonishment
they

you

barrels

replied
the
other
proudly
and
some
the
mates
pretty

general
rule

i
think
it
a
kind
of
a
hole
of
a
place
well
what
i
started
to
say
was
that
when
i
turn
up
in
boston

most
generally

the
worth
o
your

up
said
the
attendant
he
wiped
the
table
impatiently
with
his
towel
and
stood
waiting
for
lemuel
and
the
other
to
finish
all
the
rest
had
gone
do
you
be
too
fresh
pard
said
the
mate
with
the
effect
of
standing
upon
his
rights
guess
if
you
was
on
your
third
bowl
you
would
the
attendant
smiled
do
you
want
to
lend
us
a

with
the
dishes
he
asked
who

the

his
turn

day
the
boy
shook
his
head
no
i
could
if
it
was
a
case
of
sickness
of
course
i
do
it
but
i
could
spare
the
time
i
could
really
why
i
ought
to

on
the

listened
with
a
face
of
interest

asked
the
attendant
yes
i
do
said
lemuel
eagerly
know
how
to
wash
dishes
yes
answered
the
boy
not
ashamed
of
his
knowledge
as
the
boy
of
another
civilisation
might
have
been
nothing
more
distinctly
marks
the
rustic
new
england
civilisation
than
the
taming
of
its
men
to
the
performance
of
certain
domestic
offices
elsewhere
held
dishonourably
womanish
the
boy

not
only
to

and
to
keep

clean
but
to
churn
to
wash

and
to
cook
come
around
here
then
said
the
attendant
and
lemuel
promptly
obeyed
well
now
said
his
mate
that
right
i
do
it
myself
if
i
had
the
he
pulled
his
soft
wool
hat
out
of
his
hip
pocket
well
good
morning
pards
i
do
know
as
i
shall
see
you
again
much
before
lemuel
was
lifting
a
large
tray
heavy
with
empty
what
did
you
say
it
was
jimmy
seven
well
i
just
got
time
to
get
there
said
the
other
putting
on
his
hat
and
pushing
out
of
the
door
at
the
moment
lemuel
was
lifting
his
tray
of
empty
sewell
was
waking
for
the
early
breakfast
which
he
thought
it
right
to
make
not
perhaps
as
an
example
to
his
parishioners
most
of
whom
had
the
leisure
to
lie
later
but
as
a
sacrifice
not
too
definite
to
the
lingering
ideal
of
suffering
he
could
not
work
before
breakfast
his
delicate
digestion
forbade
that
or
he
would
have
risen
still
earlier
and
he
employed
the
twenty
minutes
he
had
between
his
bath
and
his
breakfast
in
skimming
the
morning
paper
just
at
present
sewell
was
taking
two
morning
papers
the
which
he
had
always
taken
and
a
cheap
little
paper
which
had
just
been
started
and
which
he
had
subscribed
for
experimentally
with
the
vague
impression
that
he
ought
to
encourage
the
young
men
who
had
established
it
he
did
not
like
it
very
well
it
was
made
up
somewhat
upon
the
western
ideal
and
dealt
with
local
matters
in
a
manner
that
was
at
once
a
little
more
lively
and
a
little
more
intimate
than
he
had
been
used
to
but
before
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
to
stop
it
his
wife
had
come
to
like
it
on
that
very
account
she
said
it
was
interesting
on
this
point
she
used
her
conscience
a
little
less
actively
than
usual
and
he
had
to
make
her
observe
that
to
be
interesting
was
not
the
whole
duty
of
journalism
it
had
become
a
matter
of
personal
pride
with
them
respectively
to
attack
and
defend
as
i
shall
call
the
little
sheet
though
that
was
not
the
name
and
sewell
had
lately
made
some
gain
through
the
character
of
the
police
reports
which
had
been
developing
into
a
feature
it
was
not
that
offensive
matters
were
introduced
the
worst
cases
were
in
fact
rather
blinked
but
sewell
insisted
that
the
tone
of
flippant
gaiety
with
which
many
facts
so
serious
so
tragic
for
their
perpetrators
and
victims
were
treated
was
odious
he
objected
to
the
court
being
called
a
mill
and
prisoners
grists
and
the
procedure
grinding
he
objected
to
the
familiar
name
of
uncle
for
the
worthy
gentleman
to
whose
care
certain
offenders
were
confided
on
probation
he
now
read
that
department
of
the
first
thing
every
morning
in
the
hope
of
finding
something
with
which
to
put
sewell
hopelessly
in
the
wrong
but
this
morning
a
heading
in
the
foreign
news
of
the
caught
his
eye
and
he
laid
aside
to
read
at
the
his
wife
came
down
in
a
cotton
dress
as
a
tribute
to
the
continued
warmth
of
the
weather
and
said
that
she
had
not
called
the
children
because
it
was
saturday
and
they
might
as
well
have
their
sleep
out
he
liked
to
see
her
in
that
dress
it
had
a
leafy
rustling
that
was
pleasant
to
his
ear
and
as
she
looked
into
the
library
he
gaily
put
out
his
hand
which
she
took
and
suffered
herself
to
be
drawn
toward
him
then
she
gave
him
a
kiss
somewhat
less
and
preoccupied
than
usual
well
you
got
lemuel
barker
off
your
mind
at
last
she
divined
in
recognition
of
her
husband
cheerfulness
yes
he
off
admitted
sewell
i
hope
he
stay
in
willoughby
pastures
after
this
of
course
it
puts
an
end
to
our
going
there
next
oh
i
do
know
sewell
feebly
demurred
do
said
his
wife
but
not
despising
his
insincerity
enough
to
insist
that
he
did
also
the
mellow
note
of
an
apostle
bell
the
gift
of
an
aesthetic
parishioner
came
from
below
and
she
said
well
there
breakfast
david
and
went
before
him
down
the
stairs
he
brought
his
papers
with
him
it
would
have
been
her
idea
of
heightened
cosiness
at
this
breakfast
which
they
had
once
a
week
alone
together
not
to
have
the
newspapers
but
she
saw
that
he
felt
differently
and
after
a
number
of
years
of
married
life
a
woman
learns
to
let
her
husband
have
his
own
way
in
some
unimportant
matters
it
was
so
much
his
nature
to
have
some
sort
of
reading
always
in
hand
that
he
was
certainly
more
himself
and
perhaps
more
companionable
with
his
papers
than
without
them
she
merely
said
let
me
take
the
when
she
had
poured
out
his
coffee
and
he
had
helped
her
to
cantaloupe
and
steak
and
spread
his
beside
his
plate
he
had
the
in
his
lap
no
you
may
have
the
he
said
handing
it
over
the
table
to
her
i
was
down
first
and
i
got
both
the
papers
i
not
really
obliged
to
make
any
division
but
i
seen
the
and
willing
to
behave
unselfishly
if
you
very
impatient
for
the
police
report
in
the
i
read
it
aloud
for
you
i
think
that
will
be
a
very
good
test
of
its
quality
do
you
he
opened
the
little
sheet
and
smiled
teasingly
at
his
wife
who
said
yes
read
it
aloud
i
not
at
all
ashamed
of
she
put
the
in
her
lap
and
leaned
defiantly
forward
while
she
stirred
her
coffee
and
sewell
unfolded
the
little
sheet
and
glanced
up
and
down
its
columns
go
on
if
you
ca
find
it
i
never
mind
here
it
is
said
sewell
and
he
began
to
read
mill
opened
yesterday
morning
with
a
smaller
number
of
grists
than
usual
but
they
made
up
in
quality
what
they
lacked
in
quantity
our
friend
metaphor
seems
to
have
weakened
under
him
a
little
commented
sewell
and
then
he
pursued
reasonable
supply
of
drunks
were
despatched
come
now
lucy
you
admit
that
this
is
horrible
he
broke
off
no
said
his
wife
i
will
admit
nothing
of
the
kind
it
flippant
i
allow
go
on
i
ca
said
sewell
but
he
obeyed
reasonable
supply
of
drunks
were
despatched
and
an
habitual
drunk
in
the
person
of
a
burly
dame
from
tipperary
who
pleaded
not
guilty
and
then
urged
the
poor
childer
in
extenuation
was
sent
down
the
harbour
for
three
months
uncle
cook
had
been
put
in
charge
of
a
couple
of
young
frailties
whose
hind
name
was
woman
how
do
you
like
that
my
dear
asked
sewell
exultantly
sewell
looked
grave
and
then
burst
into
a
shocked
laugh
you
must
stop
that
paper
david
i
ca
have
it
about
for
the
children
to
get
hold
of
but
it
funny
is
it
that
will
do
no
i
think
you
better
have
it
all
now
there
ca
be
anything
worse
it
funny
yes
with
that
truly
infernal
drollery
which
the
newspaper
wits
seem
to
have
the
art
he
read
on
a
case
was
called
that
brought
the
breath
of
clover
blossoms
and
into
the
sultry
and
warmed
the
cockles
of
the
habitués
toughened
pericardiums
with
a
touch
of
real
poetry
this
was
a
case
of
assault
with
intent
to
rob
in
which
a
lithe
young
blonde
answering
to
the
good
old
puritanic
name
of
statira
dudley
was
the
complainant
and
the
defendant
an
bucolic
youth
yclept
sewell
stopped
and
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
what
is
it
david
demanded
his
wife
why
do
you
go
on
is
it
too
scandalous
no
no
murmured
the
minister
well
i
ca
go
on
but
you
must
read
it
lucy
he
said
in
quite
a
passion
of
humility
and
you
must
try
to
be
merciful
that
poor
boy
that
he
handed
the
paper
to
his
wife
and
made
no
attempt
to
escape
from
judgment
but
sat
submissive
while
she
read
the
report
of
trial
the
story
was
told
throughout
in
the
spirit
of
the
opening
sentences
the
reporter
had
felt
the
simple
charm
of
the
affair
only
to
be
ashamed
of
it
and
the
more
offensive
about
it
when
she
had
finished
sewell
did
not
say
anything
she
merely
looked
at
her
husband
who
looked
really
sick
at
last
he
said
making
an
effort
to
rise
from
his
chair
i
must
go
and
see
him
i
yes
if
you
can
find
him
responded
his
wife
with
a
sigh
find
him
echoed
sewell
yes
goodness
knows
what
more
trouble
the
wretched
creature
got
into
by
this
time
you
saw
that
he
was
acquitted
did
you
she
demanded
in
answer
to
her
husband
stare
no
i
did
i
supposed
he
was
convicted
of
well
you
see
it
is
so
bad
as
it
might
be
she
said
using
a
pity
which
she
did
not
perhaps
altogether
feel
eat
your
breakfast
now
david
and
then
go
and
try
to
look
him
oh
i
do
want
any
breakfast
pleaded
the
minister
he
offered
to
rise
again
but
she
motioned
him
down
in
his
chair
david
you
shall
i
not
going
to
have
you
going
about
all
day
with
a
headache
eat
and
then
when
you
finished
your
breakfast
go
and
find
out
which
station
that
officer
baker
belongs
to
and
he
can
tell
you
something
about
the
boy
if
any
one
sewell
made
what
shift
he
could
to
grasp
these
practical
ideas
and
he
obediently
ate
of
whatever
his
wife
bade
him
she
would
not
let
him
hurry
his
breakfast
in
the
least
and
when
he
had
at
last
finished
she
said
now
you
can
go
david
and
when
you
found
the
boy
do
you
let
him
out
of
your
sight
again
till
you
put
him
aboard
the
train
for
willoughby
pastures
and
seen
the
train
start
out
of
the
depot
with
him
never
mind
your
sermon
i
will
be
setting
down
the
heads
of
a
sermon
while
you
gone
that
will
do
good
if
you
write
it
out
whether
it
helps
any
one
else
or
sewell
was
not
so
sure
of
that
he
had
no
doubt
that
his
wife
would
set
down
the
heads
of
a
powerful
sermon
but
he
questioned
whether
any
discourse
however
potent
would
have
force
to
benefit
such
an
abandoned
criminal
as
he
felt
himself
in
walking
down
his
steps
and
up
the
long
brick
sidewalk
of
bolingbroke
street
toward
the
public
garden
the
beds
of
geraniums
and
the
clumps
of
salvia
in
the
little
before
the
houses
which
commonly
flattered
his
eye
with
their
colour
had
a
suggestion
of
penal
fires
in
them
now
that
needed
no
lingering
superstition
in
his
nerves
to
realise
something
very
like
perdition
for
his
troubled
soul
it
was
not
wickedness
he
had
been
guilty
of
but
he
had
allowed
a
good
man
to
be
made
the
agency
of
suffering
and
he
was
sorely
to
blame
for
he
had
sinned
against
himself
this
was
what
his
conscience
said
and
though
his
reason
protested
against
his
state
of
mind
as
a
phase
of
the
religious
insanity
which
we
have
all
inherited
in
some
measure
from
puritan
times
it
could
not
help
him
he
went
along
involuntarily
framing
a
vow
that
if
providence
would
mercifully
permit
him
to
repair
the
wrong
he
had
done
he
would
not
stop
at
any
sacrifice
to
get
that
unhappy
boy
back
to
his
home
but
would
gladly
take
any
open
shame
or
obloquy
upon
himself
in
order
to
accomplish
this
he
met
a
policeman
on
the
bridge
of
the
public
garden
and
made
bold
to
ask
him
at
once
if
he
knew
an
officer
named
baker
and
which
station
he
could
be
found
at
the
policeman
was
in
the
acquaintance
of
two
officers
of
the
name
of
baker
and
he
put
his
hand
on
shoulder
in
the
paternal
manner
of
policemen
when
they
will
be
friendly
and
advised
him
to
go
first
to
the
neponset
street
station
to
which
one
of
these
bakers
was
attached
and
inquire
there
first
anyway
that
what
i
should
do
in
your
sewell
was
fulsomely
grateful
as
we
all
are
in
the
like
case
and
at
the
station
he
used
an
urbanity
with
the
captain
which
was
perhaps
not
thrown
away
upon
him
but
which
was
certainly
disproportioned
to
the
trouble
he
was
asking
him
to
take
in
saying
whether
he
knew
where
he
could
find
officer
baker
yes
i
do
said
the
captain
you
can
find
him
in
bed
upstairs
but
i
rather
you
would
wake
a
man
off
duty
if
you
do
have
to
especially
if
you
do
know
he
the
one
what
wanted
sewell
stopped
to
say
that
the
captain
was
quite
right
and
then
he
explained
why
he
wished
to
see
officer
baker
the
captain
listened
with
nods
of
his
head
at
the
names
and
facts
given
guess
you
wo
have
to
get
baker
up
for
that
i
can
tell
you
what
there
is
to
tell
i
do
know
where
your
young
man
is
now
but
i
gave
him
an
order
for
a
bed
at
the
wayfarer
lodge
last
night
and
i
guess
he
slept
there
you
a
friend
of
his
yes
said
sewell
much
questioning
inwardly
whether
he
could
be
truly
described
as
such
i
wish
to
befriend
him
he
added
savingly
i
knew
him
at
home
and
i
am
sure
of
his
oh
i
guess
he
enough
said
the
captain
well
now
i
tell
you
what
you
do
if
you
want
to
befriend
him
you
get
him
home
quick
as
you
yes
said
sewell
helpless
to
resent
the
officer
authoritative
and
patronising
tone
that
what
i
wish
to
do
do
you
suppose
he
at
the
wayfarer
lodge
now
asked
sewell
ca
say
said
the
captain
tilting
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
putting
his
quill
toothpick
between
his
lips
like
a
cigarette
the
only
way
is
to
go
and
thank
you
very
much
said
the
minister
accepting
his
dismissal
meekly
as
a
man
vowed
to
ignominy
should
but
feeling
keenly
that
he
was
dismissed
and
dismissed
in
disgrace
at
the
lodge
he
was
received
less
curtly
the
manager
was
there
with
a
long
morning
leisure
before
him
and
disposed
to
friendliness
that
sewell
found
absurdly
soothing
he
turned
over
the
orders
for
beds
delivered
by
the
vagrants
the
night
before
and
yes
he
said
coming
to
lemuel
name
he
slept
here
but
nobody
knows
where
he
is
by
this
time
wait
a
bit
sir
he
added
to
sewell
fallen
countenance
there
was
one
of
the
young
fellows
stayed
to
help
us
through
with
the
dishes
this
morning
i
have
him
up
or
may
be
you
like
to
go
down
and
take
a
look
at
our
kitchen
you
find
him
there
if
it
the
one
here
our
card
we
can
supply
you
with
all
sorts
of
firewood
at
less
cost
than
the
dealers
and
you
be
helping
the
poor
fellows
to
earn
an
honest
bed
and
breakfast
this
way
sir
sewell
promised
to
buy
his
wood
there
put
the
card
respectfully
into
his
pocket
and
followed
the
manager
downstairs
and
through
the
basement
to
the
kitchen
he
arrived
just
as
lemuel
was
about
to
lift
a
trayful
of
clean
to
carry
it
upstairs
after
a
glance
at
the
minister
he
stood
still
with
dropped
eyes
sewell
did
not
know
in
what
form
to
greet
the
boy
on
whom
he
had
unwillingly
brought
so
much
evil
and
he
found
the
greater
difficulty
in
deciding
as
he
saw
lemuel
face
hardening
against
him
barker
he
said
at
last
i
very
glad
to
find
you
i
have
been
very
anxious
to
find
lemuel
made
no
sign
of
sympathy
but
stood
still
in
his
long
check
apron
with
his
sleeves
rolled
up
to
his
elbow
and
the
minister
was
obliged
to
humble
himself
still
further
to
this
figure
of
lowly
obstinacy
i
should
like
to
speak
with
you
can
i
speak
with
you
a
few
moments
the
manager
politely
stepped
into
the
storeroom
and
affected
to
employ
himself
there
leaving
lemuel
and
the
minister
alone
together
sewell
lost
no
time
i
want
you
to
go
home
barker
i
feel
that
i
am
wholly
to
blame
and
greatly
to
blame
for
your
coming
to
boston
with
the
expectation
that
brought
you
and
that
i
am
indirectly
responsible
for
all
the
trouble
that
has
befallen
you
since
you
came
i
want
to
be
the
means
of
your
getting
home
in
any
way
you
can
let
this
was
a
very
different
way
of
talking
from
the
smooth
superiority
of
address
which
the
minister
had
used
with
him
the
other
day
at
his
own
house
lemuel
was
not
insensible
to
the
atonement
offered
him
and
it
was
not
from
sulky
stubbornness
that
he
continued
silent
and
left
the
minister
to
explore
the
causes
of
his
reticence
unaided
i
will
go
home
you
if
you
like
pursued
the
minister
though
his
mind
misgave
him
that
this
was
an
extreme
which
sewell
would
not
have
justified
him
in
i
will
go
with
you
and
explain
all
the
circumstances
to
your
friends
in
case
there
should
be
any
misunderstanding
though
in
that
event
i
should
have
to
ask
you
to
be
my
guest
till
here
the
unhappy
man
laid
hold
of
the
sheep
which
could
not
bring
him
greater
condemnation
than
the
lamb
i
guess
they
wo
know
anything
about
it
said
lemuel
with
whatever
intention
it
seemed
hardened
indifference
to
the
minister
and
he
felt
it
his
disagreeable
duty
to
say
i
am
afraid
they
will
i
read
of
it
in
the
newspaper
this
morning
and
i
afraid
that
an
exaggerated
report
of
your
misfortunes
will
reach
willoughby
pastures
and
alarm
your
a
faint
pallor
came
over
the
boy
face
and
he
stood
again
in
his
impenetrable
rustic
silence
the
voice
that
finally
spoke
from
it
said
i
guess
i
do
want
to
go
home
you
go
home
said
the
minister
with
more
of
imploring
than
imperiousness
in
his
command
what
will
they
make
of
your
prolonged
absence
i
sent
a
postal
to
mother
this
morning
they
lent
me
but
what
will
you
do
here
without
work
and
without
means
i
wish
you
to
go
home
with
me
i
feel
responsible
for
you
and
remain
with
me
till
you
can
hear
from
your
mother
i
sorry
you
came
to
boston
it
no
place
for
you
as
you
must
know
by
this
time
and
i
am
sure
your
mother
will
agree
with
me
in
desiring
your
i
guess
i
do
want
to
go
home
said
lemuel
are
you
afraid
that
an
uncharitable
construction
will
be
placed
upon
what
has
happened
to
you
by
your
neighbours
lemuel
did
not
answer
i
assure
you
that
all
that
can
be
arranged
i
will
write
to
your
pastor
and
explain
it
fully
but
in
any
event
continued
sewell
it
is
your
duty
to
yourself
and
your
friends
to
go
home
and
live
it
down
it
would
be
your
duty
to
do
so
even
if
you
had
been
guilty
of
wrong
instead
of
the
victim
of
i
do
know
said
lemuel
as
i
want
to
go
home
and
be
the
against
this
point
sewell
felt
himself
helpless
he
could
not
pretend
that
the
boy
would
not
be
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
his
friends
and
all
the
more
ridiculous
because
so
wholly
innocent
he
could
only
say
that
is
a
thing
you
must
bear
and
then
it
occurred
to
him
to
ask
do
you
feel
that
it
is
right
to
let
your
family
meet
the
ridicule
alone
i
guess
nobody
will
speak
to
mother
about
it
more
than
once
said
lemuel
with
a
just
pride
in
his
mother
powers
of
retort
a
woman
who
unaided
and
alone
had
worn
the
bloomer
costume
for
twenty
years
in
the
heart
of
a
commentative
community
like
willoughby
pastures
was
not
likely
to
be
without
a
cutting
tongue
for
her
defence
but
your
sister
urged
sewell
your
he
feebly
added
i
guess
they
will
have
to
stand
it
replied
lemuel
the
minister
heaved
a
sigh
of
hopeless
perplexity
what
do
you
propose
to
do
then
you
ca
remain
here
without
means
do
you
expect
to
sell
your
poetry
he
asked
goaded
to
the
question
by
a
conscience
peculiarly
sore
on
that
point
it
made
lemuel
blush
no
i
do
expect
to
sell
it
now
they
took
it
out
of
my
pocket
on
the
i
am
glad
of
that
said
the
minister
as
simply
and
i
feel
bound
to
warn
you
solemnly
that
there
is
absolutely
hope
for
you
in
that
lemuel
said
nothing
the
minister
stood
baffled
again
after
a
bad
moment
he
asked
have
you
anything
particular
in
view
i
do
know
as
i
how
long
can
you
remain
here
i
do
know
sewell
turned
and
followed
the
manager
into
the
refrigerator
room
where
he
had
remained
patiently
whistling
throughout
this
interview
when
he
came
back
lemuel
had
carried
one
trayful
of
bowls
upstairs
and
returned
for
another
load
which
he
was
piling
carefully
up
for
safe
transportation
the
manager
tells
me
said
sewell
that
practically
you
can
stay
here
as
long
as
you
like
if
you
work
but
he
does
think
it
desirable
you
should
remain
nor
do
i
but
i
wish
to
find
you
here
again
when
i
come
back
i
have
something
in
view
for
this
seemed
to
be
a
question
and
lemuel
said
all
right
and
went
on
piling
up
his
bowls
he
added
i
should
want
you
to
take
a
great
deal
of
oh
it
no
trouble
groaned
the
minister
then
i
may
depend
upon
seeing
you
here
any
time
during
the
day
i
do
know
as
i
going
away
lemuel
admitted
well
then
for
the
present
said
sewell
and
after
speaking
again
to
the
manager
and
gratefully
ordering
some
kindling
which
he
did
not
presently
need
he
went
out
and
took
his
way
homeward
but
he
stopped
half
a
block
short
of
his
own
door
and
rang
at
miss
vane
to
his
perturbed
and
eager
spirit
it
seemed
nothing
short
of
a
divine
mercy
that
she
should
be
at
home
if
he
had
not
been
a
man
bent
on
repairing
his
wrong
at
any
cost
to
others
he
would
hardly
have
taken
the
step
he
now
contemplated
without
first
advising
with
his
wife
who
he
felt
sure
would
have
advised
against
it
his
face
did
not
brighten
at
all
when
miss
vane
came
briskly
in
with
the
d
do
which
he
commonly
found
so
cheering
she
pulled
up
the
blind
and
saw
his
knotted
brow
what
is
the
matter
you
look
as
if
you
had
got
lemuel
barker
back
on
your
i
have
said
the
minister
briefly
miss
vane
gave
a
wild
laugh
of
delight
you
mean
it
she
sputtered
sitting
down
before
him
and
peering
into
his
face
what
you
mean
sewell
was
obliged
to
possess
miss
vane
entire
ignorance
of
all
the
facts
in
detail
from
point
to
point
he
paused
he
began
really
to
be
afraid
she
would
do
herself
an
injury
with
her
laughing
she
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
bowed
her
head
forward
with
her
face
buried
in
her
handkerchief
what
what
do
you
they
did
with
the
they
stole
from
him
well
one
thing
i
sure
they
do
said
sewell
bitterly
they
did
miss
vane
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
and
then
plucked
it
away
and
shrieked
again
she
stopped
with
the
sudden
calm
that
succeeds
such
a
paroxysm
and
does
sewell
know
all
about
this
she
panted
she
knows
everything
except
my
finding
him
in
the
department
of
the
wayfarer
lodge
said
sewell
gloomily
and
my
coming
to
why
do
you
come
to
me
asked
miss
vane
her
face
twitching
and
her
eyes
brimming
because
answered
sewell
i
rather
not
go
to
her
till
i
have
done
miss
vane
gave
way
again
and
sewell
sat
regarding
her
ruefully
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
she
looked
at
him
over
her
handkerchief
which
she
kept
pressed
against
her
mouth
i
have
the
least
idea
what
i
expected
you
to
do
i
expected
you
to
tell
me
you
have
an
inventive
miss
vane
shook
her
head
her
eyes
grew
serious
and
after
a
moment
she
said
i
afraid
i
not
equal
to
lemuel
barker
besides
she
added
with
a
tinge
of
trouble
i
have
problem
yes
said
the
minister
sympathetically
how
has
the
flower
charity
turned
out
she
went
yesterday
with
one
of
the
ladies
and
carried
flowers
to
the
city
hospital
but
she
was
at
all
satisfied
with
the
result
she
said
the
patients
were
mostly
disgusting
old
men
that
had
been
shaved
i
think
that
now
she
wants
to
try
her
flowers
on
criminals
she
says
she
wishes
to
visit
the
sewell
brightened
forlornly
why
not
let
her
reform
barker
this
sent
miss
vane
off
again
poor
boy
she
sighed
when
she
had
come
to
herself
no
there
nothing
that
i
can
do
for
him
except
to
order
some
firewood
from
his
i
did
that
said
sewell
but
i
do
see
how
it
to
help
barker
i
would
gladly
join
in
a
public
subscription
to
send
him
home
but
you
say
he
wo
home
he
wo
go
home
sighed
the
minister
he
determined
to
stay
i
suspect
he
would
accept
employment
if
it
were
offered
him
in
the
right
miss
vane
shook
her
head
there
nothing
i
can
think
of
except
shovelling
snow
and
as
yet
it
rather
warm
october
there
certainly
no
snow
to
shovel
admitted
sewell
he
rose
disconsolately
well
there
nothing
for
it
i
suppose
but
to
put
him
down
at
the
christian
union
and
explain
his
checkered
career
to
everybody
who
proposes
to
employ
miss
vane
could
not
keep
the
laughter
out
of
her
eyes
she
nervously
tapped
her
lips
with
her
handkerchief
to
keep
it
from
them
suddenly
she
halted
sewell
in
his
dejected
progress
toward
the
door
i
might
give
him
my
furnace
furnace
echoed
sewell
yes
jackson
has
for
twelve
dollars
a
month
and
at
present
there
is
a
i
believe
that
what
it
called
and
i
had
determined
not
to
yield
as
long
as
the
fine
weather
lasted
i
knew
i
should
give
in
at
the
first
frost
i
will
take
barker
now
if
you
think
he
can
manage
the
i
no
doubt
he
can
has
jackson
really
struck
miss
vane
nodded
he
has
said
anything
to
me
about
he
probably
intends
to
make
special
terms
to
the
clergy
but
he
told
me
he
was
putting
up
the
rates
on
all
his
this
if
he
puts
them
up
on
me
i
will
take
barker
too
said
the
minister
boldly
if
he
will
come
he
added
with
less
courage
well
i
will
go
round
to
the
lodge
and
see
what
he
thinks
of
it
of
course
he
ca
live
upon
ten
dollars
a
month
and
i
must
look
him
up
something
that
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
at
present
said
miss
vane
oh
you
indefinitely
good
to
think
of
so
much
said
sewell
you
must
excuse
me
if
my
reception
of
your
kindness
has
been
qualified
by
the
reticence
with
which
barker
received
mine
this
oh
do
tell
me
about
it
cried
miss
vane
sometime
i
will
but
i
can
assure
you
it
was
such
as
to
make
me
shrink
from
another
interview
i
do
know
but
barker
may
fling
your
proffered
furnace
in
my
teeth
but
i
sure
we
both
mean
well
and
i
thank
you
all
the
same
poor
sewell
said
miss
vane
following
him
to
the
door
may
i
run
down
and
tell
sewell
not
yet
said
the
minister
sadly
he
was
too
insecure
of
reception
to
be
able
to
enjoy
the
joke
when
he
got
back
to
the
wayfarer
lodge
whither
he
made
himself
walk
in
penance
he
found
lemuel
with
a
book
in
his
hand
reading
while
the
cook
stirred
about
the
kitchen
and
the
broth
which
he
had
well
under
way
for
the
meal
lifted
the
lid
of
its
boiler
from
time
to
time
and
sent
out
a
joyous
whiff
of
steam
the
place
had
really
a
cosiness
of
its
own
and
sewell
began
to
fear
that
his
victim
had
been
so
far
corrupted
by
its
comfort
as
to
be
unwilling
to
leave
the
refuge
he
had
often
seen
the
subtly
disastrous
effect
of
bounty
and
it
was
one
of
the
things
he
trembled
for
in
considering
the
question
of
public
aid
to
the
poor
before
he
addressed
barker
he
saw
him
entered
upon
the
dire
life
of
idleness
and
dependence
partial
or
entire
which
he
had
known
so
many
americans
even
willing
to
lead
since
the
first
great
hard
times
began
and
he
spoke
to
him
with
the
asperity
of
anticipative
censure
barker
he
said
and
lemuel
lifted
his
head
from
the
book
he
was
reading
i
have
found
something
for
you
to
do
i
still
prefer
you
should
go
home
and
i
advise
you
to
do
so
but
he
added
at
the
look
that
came
into
lemuel
face
if
you
are
determined
to
stay
this
is
the
best
i
can
do
for
you
it
is
a
full
support
but
it
something
and
you
must
look
about
for
yourself
and
not
rest
till
you
found
full
work
and
something
better
fitted
for
you
do
you
think
you
can
take
care
of
a
furnace
hot
air
asked
lemuel
i
guess
so
i
took
care
of
the
church
furnace
last
i
did
know
you
had
one
said
the
minister
brightening
in
the
ray
of
hope
would
you
be
willing
to
take
care
of
a
domestic
furnace
a
furnace
in
a
private
house
lemuel
pondered
the
proposal
in
silence
whatever
objections
there
were
to
it
in
its
difference
from
the
aims
of
his
ambition
in
coming
to
the
city
of
boston
he
kept
to
himself
and
his
ignorance
of
city
prejudices
and
sophistications
probably
suggested
nothing
against
the
honest
work
to
his
pride
i
guess
i
should
he
said
at
last
well
then
come
with
sewell
judged
it
best
not
to
tell
him
whose
furnace
he
was
to
take
care
of
he
had
an
impression
that
miss
vane
was
included
in
the
resentment
which
lemuel
seemed
to
cherish
toward
him
but
when
he
had
him
at
her
door
it
the
lady
whom
you
saw
at
my
house
the
other
day
he
explained
it
was
then
too
late
for
lemuel
to
rebel
if
he
had
wished
and
they
went
in
if
there
was
any
such
unkindness
in
lemuel
breast
toward
her
it
yielded
promptly
to
her
tact
she
treated
him
at
once
not
like
a
servant
but
like
a
young
person
and
yet
she
used
a
sort
of
respect
for
his
independence
which
was
soothing
to
his
rustic
pride
she
put
it
on
the
money
basis
at
once
she
told
him
that
she
should
give
him
ten
dollars
a
month
for
taking
care
of
the
furnace
keeping
the
sidewalk
clear
of
snow
shovelling
the
paths
in
the
backyard
for
the
women
to
get
at
their
carrying
up
and
down
coal
and
ashes
for
the
grates
and
doing
errands
she
said
that
this
was
what
she
had
always
paid
and
asked
him
if
he
understood
and
were
satisfied
lemuel
answered
with
one
yes
to
both
her
questions
and
then
miss
vane
said
that
of
course
till
the
weather
changed
they
should
want
no
fire
in
the
furnace
but
that
it
might
change
any
day
and
they
should
begin
at
once
and
count
october
as
a
full
month
she
thought
he
had
better
go
down
and
look
at
the
furnace
and
see
if
it
was
in
order
she
had
had
the
pipes
cleaned
but
perhaps
it
needed
blacking
the
cook
would
show
him
how
it
worked
she
went
with
him
to
the
head
of
the
basement
stairs
and
calling
down
jane
here
is
lemuel
come
to
look
after
the
furnace
left
him
and
jane
to
complete
the
acquaintance
upon
coming
in
sight
of
each
other
and
went
back
to
the
minister
he
had
risen
to
go
and
she
gave
him
her
hand
while
a
smile
rippled
into
laughter
on
her
lips
do
you
think
she
asked
struggling
with
her
mirth
to
keep
unheard
of
those
below
that
it
is
quite
the
work
for
a
literary
man
if
he
is
a
man
said
sewell
courageously
the
work
wo
keep
him
from
being
miss
vane
laughed
at
his
sudden
recovery
of
spirit
as
she
had
laughed
at
his
dejection
but
he
did
not
care
he
hurried
home
with
a
sermon
kindling
in
his
mind
so
obviously
that
his
wife
did
not
detain
him
beyond
a
few
vital
questions
and
let
him
escape
from
having
foisted
his
burden
upon
miss
vane
with
the
simple
comment
well
we
shall
see
how
that
will
as
once
before
sewell
tacitly
took
a
hint
from
his
own
experience
and
enlarging
to
more
serious
facts
from
it
preached
effort
in
the
erring
he
denounced
mere
remorse
better
not
feel
that
at
all
he
taught
and
he
declared
that
what
is
ordinarily
distinguished
from
remorse
as
repentance
was
equally
a
mere
corrosion
of
the
spirit
unless
some
attempt
at
reparation
went
with
it
he
maintained
that
though
some
mischiefs
perhaps
most
mischiefs
were
irreparable
so
far
as
restoring
the
original
status
was
concerned
yet
every
mischief
was
reparable
in
the
and
the
good
deed
of
its
perpetrator
do
what
you
could
to
retrieve
yourself
from
error
and
then
not
leave
the
rest
to
providence
but
keep
doing
the
good
however
small
must
grow
if
tended
and
nurtured
like
a
useful
plant
as
the
evil
would
certainly
grow
like
a
wild
and
poisonous
weed
if
left
to
itself
sin
he
said
was
a
terrible
mystery
one
scarcely
knew
how
to
deal
with
it
or
to
attempt
to
determine
its
nature
but
perhaps
he
threw
out
the
thought
while
warning
those
who
heard
him
of
its
danger
in
some
aspects
sin
was
not
wholly
an
evil
we
were
so
apt
in
this
world
of
struggle
and
ambition
to
become
centred
solely
in
ourselves
that
possibly
the
wrong
done
to
another
the
wrong
that
turned
our
thoughts
from
ourselves
and
kept
them
bent
in
agony
and
despair
upon
the
suffering
we
had
caused
another
and
knew
not
how
to
mitigate
possibly
this
wrong
nay
certainly
this
wrong
was
good
in
disguise
but
returning
to
his
original
point
we
were
to
beware
how
we
rested
in
this
despair
in
the
very
extremity
of
our
anguish
our
fear
our
shame
we
were
to
gird
ourselves
up
to
reparation
strive
to
do
good
he
preached
strive
most
of
all
to
do
good
to
those
you
have
done
harm
to
his
text
was
cease
to
do
he
finished
his
sermon
during
the
afternoon
and
in
the
evening
his
wife
said
they
would
run
up
to
miss
vane
sewell
shrank
from
this
a
little
with
the
obscure
dread
that
lemuel
might
have
turned
his
back
upon
good
fortune
and
abandoned
the
place
offered
him
in
which
case
sewell
would
have
to
give
a
wholly
different
turn
to
his
sermon
but
he
consented
as
indeed
he
must
he
was
as
curious
as
his
wife
to
know
how
the
experiment
had
resulted
miss
vane
did
not
wait
to
let
them
ask
my
dear
she
said
kissing
sewell
and
giving
her
hand
to
the
minister
in
one
he
is
a
pearl
and
i
kept
him
from
mixing
his
native
lustre
with
rising
sun
stove
polish
by
becoming
his
creditor
in
the
price
of
a
pair
of
overalls
i
had
no
idea
they
were
so
cheap
and
you
can
see
that
they
will
fade
with
a
few
washings
to
a
perfect
millet
blue
they
were
quite
his
own
idea
when
he
found
the
furnace
needed
blacking
and
he
wanted
to
use
the
fifty
cents
he
earned
this
morning
toward
the
purchase
but
i
insisted
upon
advancing
the
entire
dollar
myself
neatness
deference
he
is
each
and
every
one
of
them
in
sewell
could
not
forbear
a
glance
of
triumph
at
his
wife
you
leave
us
very
little
to
ask
said
that
injured
woman
but
i
left
myself
a
great
deal
to
tell
my
dear
retorted
miss
vane
and
i
propose
to
keep
the
floor
though
i
do
really
know
where
to
i
thought
you
had
got
past
the
necessity
of
beginning
said
sewell
we
know
that
the
new
pearl
sweeps
clean
miss
vane
applauded
his
mixed
metaphor
and
now
you
might
go
on
from
that
well
you
may
think
i
rash
said
miss
vane
but
i
thoroughly
made
up
my
mind
to
keep
dear
miss
vane
cried
the
minister
mrs
sewell
thinks
rash
but
i
do
what
do
you
mean
by
keeping
him
keeping
him
as
a
fixture
a
permanency
a
oh
a
continuosity
i
know
what
that
is
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
term
but
i
not
sure
that
i
follow
your
meaning
why
it
simply
this
said
miss
vane
i
have
long
secretly
wanted
the
protection
of
what
jane
calls
a
in
the
house
and
when
i
saw
how
lemuel
had
blacked
the
furnace
i
knew
i
should
feel
as
safe
with
him
as
with
a
whole
body
of
well
sighed
the
minister
you
have
not
been
rash
perhaps
but
you
allow
that
you
been
no
said
miss
vane
i
wo
allow
that
i
have
simply
been
intuitive
nothing
more
his
functions
are
not
decided
yet
but
it
is
decided
that
he
is
to
stay
he
to
sleep
in
the
little
room
over
the
l
and
in
my
tranquillised
consciousness
he
been
there
years
and
has
sibyl
undertaken
barker
reformation
asked
sewell
do
interrupt
do
anticipate
i
admit
nothing
till
i
come
to
it
but
after
i
had
arranged
with
lemuel
i
began
to
think
of
that
was
like
some
ladies
i
have
known
of
said
sewell
you
women
commit
yourselves
to
a
scheme
in
order
to
show
your
skill
in
reconciling
circumstances
to
the
irretrievable
well
interrupt
david
cried
his
wife
oh
let
him
go
on
said
miss
vane
it
all
very
well
taking
people
into
your
house
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
in
obedience
to
a
generous
impulse
but
when
you
reflect
that
the
object
of
your
good
intentions
slept
in
the
wayfarer
lodge
the
night
before
and
in
the
the
night
before
that
and
enjoys
a
newspaper
celebrity
in
connection
with
a
case
of
assault
and
battery
with
intent
to
rob
why
then
you
reflect
yes
said
sewell
that
is
just
the
point
where
i
should
i
thought
continued
miss
vane
i
had
better
tell
sibyl
all
about
it
so
if
by
any
chance
the
neighbours
kitchens
should
have
heard
of
the
case
they
read
the
police
reports
very
carefully
in
the
kitchens
they
do
in
some
interrupted
sewell
it
well
for
you
they
do
david
said
his
wife
your
would
have
been
in
your
refuge
still
if
they
i
see
cried
the
minister
i
shall
have
to
take
the
another
miss
vane
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
sympathetic
ignorance
but
they
did
not
explain
and
she
went
on
and
if
they
should
hear
lemuel
name
and
put
two
and
two
together
and
the
talk
should
get
to
sibyl
well
i
thought
it
all
over
until
the
whole
thing
became
perfectly
lurid
and
i
wished
lemuel
barker
was
back
in
the
depths
of
willoughby
pastures
i
understand
said
sewell
go
on
miss
vane
did
so
after
stopping
to
laugh
it
seemed
to
me
i
wait
for
sibyl
to
get
home
she
spent
the
night
in
brookline
and
come
till
five
to
tell
her
i
began
before
she
had
got
her
hat
or
gloves
off
and
she
sat
down
with
them
on
and
listened
like
a
child
to
the
ancient
mariner
but
she
lost
no
time
when
she
understood
the
facts
she
went
out
immediately
and
stripped
the
nasturtium
bed
if
you
could
have
seen
it
when
you
came
in
hardly
a
blossom
left
she
took
the
decorations
of
lemuel
room
into
her
own
hands
at
once
and
if
there
is
any
saving
power
in
nasturtiums
he
will
be
a
changed
person
she
says
that
now
the
great
object
is
to
keep
him
from
feeling
that
he
has
been
an
outcast
and
needs
to
be
reclaimed
she
says
nothing
could
be
worse
for
him
i
do
know
how
she
barker
might
feel
that
he
was
disgraced
said
the
minister
but
i
do
believe
that
a
whole
system
of
ethics
would
make
him
suspect
that
he
needed
to
be
he
makes
me
suspect
that
need
to
be
reclaimed
said
miss
vane
when
he
looks
at
me
with
those
beautiful
honest
eyes
of
sewell
asked
has
he
seen
the
decorations
yet
not
at
all
they
are
to
steal
upon
him
when
he
comes
in
the
gas
is
to
be
turned
very
low
and
he
is
to
notice
everything
gradually
so
as
not
to
get
the
impression
that
things
have
been
done
with
a
design
upon
she
laughed
in
reporting
these
ideas
which
were
plainly
those
of
the
young
girl
sh
she
whispered
at
the
end
a
tall
girl
with
a
slim
vase
in
her
hand
drifted
in
upon
their
group
like
an
apparition
she
had
heavy
black
eyebrows
with
beautiful
blue
eyes
under
them
full
of
an
intensity
unrelieved
by
humour
aunty
she
said
severely
have
you
been
telling
only
and
sewell
sibyl
said
miss
vane
knowing
wo
hurt
he
never
know
if
he
hears
you
laughing
he
know
it
about
him
he
in
the
kitchen
now
he
come
in
the
back
way
do
be
she
had
given
her
hand
without
other
greeting
in
her
preoccupation
to
each
of
the
sewells
in
turn
and
now
she
passed
out
of
the
room
xi
what
makes
lemuel
such
a
gift
said
miss
vane
in
a
talk
which
she
had
with
sewell
a
month
later
is
that
he
is
so
do
you
mean
just
in
the
supplementary
sense
of
the
term
well
not
in
the
sense
i
mean
that
he
supplements
us
all
and
singular
if
you
will
excuse
the
legal
oh
certainly
said
sewell
i
should
like
even
more
yes
but
before
i
particularise
i
must
express
my
general
satisfaction
in
him
as
a
i
had
no
idea
that
man
bodies
in
a
house
were
so
perfectly
i
sometimes
feared
that
we
were
not
fully
appreciated
said
sewell
well
the
house
is
another
thing
with
a
in
it
i
often
gone
without
little
things
i
wanted
simply
because
i
hated
to
make
sarah
bring
them
and
because
i
hated
still
worse
to
go
after
them
knowing
we
were
both
weakly
and
tired
now
i
deny
myself
nothing
i
make
lemuel
fetch
and
carry
without
remorse
from
morning
till
night
i
never
knew
it
before
but
the
seems
never
to
be
tired
or
ill
or
yes
said
sewell
that
is
often
the
idea
of
the
i
not
sure
that
it
oh
attack
it
implored
miss
vane
you
do
what
a
blessing
it
is
then
the
never
complains
and
i
ca
see
that
he
expects
anything
more
in
an
order
than
the
clear
understanding
of
it
he
does
expect
it
to
be
accounted
for
in
any
way
the
fact
that
you
say
you
want
a
thing
is
enough
it
is
very
strange
then
the
moral
support
of
the
presence
of
a
is
enormous
i
now
know
that
i
have
never
slept
soundly
since
i
have
kept
house
alone
that
i
have
never
passed
a
night
without
hearing
burglars
or
smelling
and
now
and
now
i
should
mind
a
legion
of
burglars
in
the
house
i
mind
being
burned
in
my
bed
every
night
i
feel
that
lemuel
is
in
charge
and
that
nothing
can
is
he
really
so
satisfactory
asked
sewell
exhaling
a
deep
relief
he
is
indeed
said
miss
vane
i
could
exaggerate
well
well
do
try
we
are
finite
after
all
you
know
do
you
think
it
can
last
i
have
thought
of
that
answered
miss
vane
i
do
see
why
it
should
last
i
have
tried
to
believe
that
i
did
a
foolish
thing
in
coming
to
your
rescue
but
i
ca
see
that
i
did
i
do
see
why
it
should
last
as
long
as
lemuel
chooses
and
he
seems
perfectly
contented
with
his
lot
he
does
seem
to
regard
it
as
domestic
service
but
as
domestication
and
he
patronises
our
inefficiency
while
he
spares
it
his
is
extraordinary
it
exemplary
it
almost
makes
one
wish
to
have
they
had
now
got
pretty
far
from
the
original
proposition
and
sewell
returned
to
it
with
the
question
well
and
how
does
he
supplement
you
singularly
oh
oh
yes
said
miss
vane
i
could
hardly
tell
you
without
going
into
too
deep
a
study
of
i
rather
fond
of
that
suggested
the
minister
yes
and
i
no
doubt
we
should
all
work
very
nicely
into
a
sermon
as
illustrations
but
i
ca
more
than
indicate
the
different
cases
in
the
first
place
jane
forgetfulness
seems
to
be
growing
upon
her
and
since
lemuel
came
she
abandoned
herself
to
ecstasies
of
yes
yes
she
quite
given
over
remembering
because
she
knows
that
he
will
remember
i
see
and
you
well
you
have
sometimes
thought
i
was
a
little
a
little
did
i
think
it
was
a
little
well
a
good
deal
but
it
was
all
nothing
to
what
i
been
since
lemuel
came
i
used
to
keep
some
slight
check
upon
myself
for
sake
but
i
do
now
i
know
that
lemuel
is
there
to
temper
to
delay
to
modify
the
effect
of
every
impulse
and
so
i
am
all
impulse
now
and
i
quite
ceased
to
rule
my
temper
i
know
that
lemuel
has
enough
for
all
the
tempers
in
the
house
and
so
i
feel
perfectly
calm
in
my
wildest
transports
of
i
understand
said
sewell
and
does
sibyl
permit
herself
a
similar
excess
in
her
fancies
and
ambitions
quite
said
miss
vane
i
do
know
that
she
consciously
relies
upon
lemuel
to
supplement
her
any
more
than
jane
does
but
she
must
be
unconsciously
aware
that
no
extravagance
of
hers
can
be
dangerous
while
lemuel
is
in
the
unconsciously
aware
is
good
she
has
got
tired
of
reforming
him
yet
i
do
know
i
sometimes
think
she
wishes
he
had
gone
a
little
farther
in
crime
then
his
reformation
would
be
more
yes
i
can
appreciate
that
does
she
still
look
after
his
art
and
literature
that
phase
has
changed
a
little
she
thinks
now
that
he
ought
to
be
stimulated
if
anything
that
he
ought
to
read
george
eliot
she
put
and
on
his
shelf
she
says
that
he
looks
like
tito
sewell
rose
well
i
do
see
but
what
your
supplement
is
a
very
demoralising
element
i
shall
never
dare
to
tell
sewell
what
oh
she
knows
it
cried
miss
vane
we
agreed
that
you
will
counteract
any
temptation
that
lemuel
may
feel
to
abuse
his
advantages
by
the
ferociously
sermons
you
preach
at
him
every
do
i
preach
at
him
do
you
notice
it
asked
sewell
nervously
notice
it
laughed
miss
vane
i
should
think
your
whole
congregation
would
notice
it
you
seem
to
look
at
nobody
i
know
it
since
he
began
to
come
i
ca
keep
my
eyes
off
him
i
do
deliver
my
sermons
at
him
i
believe
i
write
them
at
him
he
has
an
eye
of
terrible
and
exacting
truth
i
feel
myself
on
trial
before
him
he
holds
me
up
to
a
standard
of
sincerity
that
is
killing
me
sewell
was
bad
enough
i
was
reasonably
bad
myself
but
this
could
you
keep
him
away
do
you
think
it
exactly
decorous
to
let
your
occupy
a
seat
in
your
family
pew
how
do
you
suppose
it
looks
to
the
supreme
being
miss
vane
was
convulsed
i
had
precisely
those
misgivings
but
lemuel
had
he
asked
me
what
the
number
of
our
pew
was
and
i
had
the
heart
or
else
i
had
the
face
to
tell
him
he
must
sit
in
it
how
could
i
do
you
think
it
so
very
scandalous
i
do
know
said
sewell
it
may
lead
to
great
abuses
if
we
tacitly
confess
ourselves
equal
in
the
sight
of
god
how
much
better
are
we
than
the
roman
catholics
miss
vane
could
not
suffer
these
ironies
to
go
on
he
approves
of
your
preaching
he
has
talked
your
sermons
over
with
me
you
ought
to
oh
i
do
do
you
think
he
really
softening
a
little
toward
me
not
personally
that
i
know
said
miss
vane
but
he
seems
to
regard
you
as
a
channel
of
the
i
ought
to
be
glad
of
so
much
said
sewell
i
confess
that
i
supposed
he
was
at
all
of
our
way
of
thinking
they
preached
a
very
appreciable
orthodoxy
at
willoughby
i
do
know
about
that
said
miss
vane
i
only
know
that
he
approves
your
theology
or
your
ethics
i
hope
i
sure
after
a
thoughtful
moment
the
minister
asked
have
you
observed
that
they
have
softened
him
socially
at
all
broken
up
that
terrible
rigidity
of
attitude
that
dismaying
retentiveness
of
speech
i
know
what
you
mean
cried
miss
vane
delightedly
i
believe
lemuel
a
little
more
supple
a
little
like
a
granite
boulder
in
one
of
his
meadows
but
i
ca
say
that
he
glib
yet
he
is
apparently
going
to
say
more
than
he
i
hope
he
thinks
more
than
he
says
sighed
the
minister
my
interviews
with
lemuel
have
left
me
not
only
exhausted
but
bruised
as
if
i
had
been
hurling
myself
against
a
dead
wall
yes
i
manage
him
better
from
the
pulpit
and
i
certainly
ought
to
complain
i
expect
him
to
make
any
response
and
i
perceive
that
i
am
not
so
sore
as
after
meeting
him
in
private
that
evening
lemuel
was
helping
to
throng
the
platform
of
an
overcrowded
it
was
saturday
night
and
he
was
going
to
the
provision
man
up
toward
the
south
end
whom
miss
vane
was
dealing
with
for
the
time
being
in
an
economical
recoil
from
her
expensive
back
bay
provision
man
to
order
a
forgotten
essential
of
the
sunday
supplies
he
had
already
been
at
the
grocer
and
was
carrying
home
three
or
four
packages
to
save
the
cart
from
going
a
third
time
that
day
to
bolingbroke
street
and
he
stepped
down
into
the
road
when
two
girls
came
squeezing
their
way
out
of
the
car
well
i
glad
said
one
of
them
in
a
voice
lemuel
knew
at
once
there
one
man
got
the
politeness
to
make
a
grain
o
room
for
you
thank
you
sir
she
added
with
more
scorn
for
the
others
than
gratitude
for
lemuel
a
gentleman
the
hardened
offenders
on
the
platform
laughed
but
lemuel
said
simply
you
quite
why
land
sakes
shouted
the
girl
well
if
you
she
exclaimed
to
her
companion
in
utter
admiration
then
she
added
to
lemuel
why
i
did
but
what
you
a
back
home
long
ago
well
i
glad
in
boston
ever
since
well
i
want
to
know
the
conductor
had
halted
his
car
for
the
girls
to
get
off
but
as
he
remarked
with
a
vicious
jerk
at
his
he
could
not
keep
his
car
standing
there
while
a
woman
was
asking
about
the
folks
and
the
horses
started
up
and
left
lemuel
behind
well
there
said
grier
i
hai
made
you
lose
your
car
i
never
see
folks
like
some
them
oh
i
guess
i
can
walk
the
rest
of
the
way
said
lemuel
his
face
bright
with
a
pleasure
visible
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
that
brought
out
statira
dudley
smiles
and
the
forward
thrust
of
as
they
turned
toward
the
pavement
together
well
i
guess
i
spoke
about
you
once
i
have
a
hundred
times
in
the
last
six
weeks
i
always
told
you
sure
to
turn
up
this
you
in
boston
all
the
time
i
guessed
got
a
disgust
for
the
place
you
would
want
to
see
it
again
for
statira
did
not
say
anything
she
walked
on
the
other
side
of
grier
who
thrust
her
in
the
side
from
time
to
time
with
a
lift
of
her
elbow
in
demand
of
sympathy
and
corroboration
but
though
she
only
spoke
to
answer
yes
or
no
lemuel
could
see
that
she
was
always
smiling
or
else
biting
her
lip
to
keep
herself
from
it
he
thought
she
looked
about
as
pretty
as
anybody
could
and
that
she
was
again
very
fashionably
dressed
she
had
on
a
short
dolman
and
a
pretty
hat
that
shaded
her
forehead
but
fitted
close
round
and
she
wore
long
gloves
that
came
up
on
her
sleeves
she
had
a
book
from
the
library
she
walked
with
a
little
bridling
movement
that
he
found
very
ladylike
grier
tilted
along
between
them
and
her
tongue
ran
and
ran
so
that
lemuel
when
they
came
to
miss
vane
provision
man
could
hardly
get
in
a
word
to
say
that
he
guessed
he
must
stop
there
statira
drifted
on
a
few
paces
but
grier
halted
abruptly
with
him
well
you
ever
up
our
way
we
sh
be
much
pleased
to
have
you
call
barker
she
said
formally
i
should
be
much
pleased
to
do
so
said
lemuel
with
equal
state
but
just
a
little
ways
round
here
on
the
avenue
she
added
lemuel
answered
i
guess
i
know
where
it
he
did
not
mean
it
for
anything
of
a
joke
but
both
the
girls
laughed
and
though
she
had
been
so
silent
before
statira
laughed
the
most
he
could
not
help
laughing
either
when
grier
said
i
guess
if
you
was
likely
to
forget
the
number
you
could
go
round
to
the
station
and
inquire
they
got
your
address
grier
you
be
still
said
statira
said
that
the
way
she
knew
you
was
from
willoughby
pastures
her
folks
is
from
up
that
way
themselves
she
says
the
minute
she
heard
the
name
she
knew
it
could
you
whoever
it
was
done
grier
cried
statira
again
i
tell
her
she
do
believe
any
harm
can
come
out
the
town
willoughby
cried
statira
lemuel
was
pleased
but
he
could
not
say
a
word
he
could
not
look
at
statira
well
good
evening
said
amanda
grier
well
good
evening
said
lemuel
well
good
evening
said
statira
well
good
evening
said
lemuel
again
the
next
moment
they
were
gone
round
the
corner
and
he
was
left
standing
before
the
provision
man
with
his
packages
in
his
hand
it
did
not
come
to
him
till
he
had
transacted
his
business
within
and
was
on
his
way
home
that
he
had
been
very
impolite
not
to
ask
if
he
might
not
see
them
home
he
did
not
know
but
he
ought
to
go
back
and
try
to
find
them
and
apologise
for
his
rudeness
and
yet
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
do
that
either
he
had
no
excuse
for
it
he
was
afraid
it
would
seem
queer
and
make
them
laugh
besides
he
had
those
things
for
miss
vane
and
the
cook
wanted
some
of
them
at
once
he
could
hardly
get
to
sleep
that
night
for
thinking
of
his
blunder
and
at
times
he
cowered
under
the
bedclothes
for
shame
he
decided
that
the
only
way
for
him
to
do
was
to
keep
out
of
their
way
after
this
and
if
he
ever
met
them
anywhere
to
pretend
not
to
see
them
the
next
morning
he
went
to
hear
sewell
preach
as
usual
but
he
found
himself
wandering
far
from
the
sermon
and
asking
or
answering
this
or
that
in
a
talk
with
those
girls
that
kept
going
on
in
his
mind
the
minister
himself
seemed
to
wander
and
at
times
when
lemuel
forced
a
return
to
him
he
thought
he
was
boggling
strangely
for
the
first
time
sewell
sermon
in
his
opinion
did
not
come
to
much
while
his
place
in
miss
vane
household
was
indefinitely
ascertained
he
had
the
whole
of
sunday
and
he
always
wrote
home
in
the
afternoon
or
brought
up
the
arrears
of
the
journal
he
had
begun
keeping
but
the
sunday
afternoon
that
followed
he
was
too
excited
to
stay
in
and
write
he
thought
he
would
go
and
take
a
walk
and
get
away
from
the
things
that
pestered
him
he
did
not
watch
where
he
was
going
and
after
a
while
he
turned
a
corner
and
suddenly
found
himself
in
a
long
street
planted
with
and
looking
and
fallen
from
a
former
dignity
he
perceived
that
it
could
never
have
been
fashionable
like
bolingbroke
street
or
beacon
the
houses
were
narrow
and
their
doors
opened
from
little
cavernous
arches
let
into
the
brick
fronts
and
they
stood
flush
upon
the
pavement
the
sidewalks
were
full
of
people
mostly
girls
walking
up
and
down
at
the
corners
young
fellows
lounged
and
there
were
groups
before
the
cigar
stores
and
the
fruit
stalls
which
were
open
it
was
not
very
cold
yet
and
the
children
who
swarmed
upon
the
low
were
bareheaded
and
often
the
street
was
not
nearly
so
well
kept
as
the
streets
on
the
back
bay
that
lemuel
was
more
used
to
but
he
could
see
that
it
was
not
a
rowdy
street
either
he
looked
up
at
a
lamp
on
the
first
corner
he
came
to
and
read
pleasant
avenue
on
it
then
he
said
that
the
witch
was
in
it
he
dramatised
a
scene
of
meeting
those
girls
and
was
very
glib
in
it
and
they
were
rather
shy
and
miss
dudley
kept
behind
amanda
grier
who
nudged
her
with
her
elbow
when
lemuel
said
he
had
come
round
to
see
if
anybody
had
robbed
them
of
their
books
on
the
way
home
after
he
left
them
last
night
but
all
the
time
as
he
hurried
along
to
the
next
corner
he
looked
fearfully
to
the
right
and
left
presently
he
began
to
steal
guilty
glances
at
the
numbers
of
the
houses
he
said
to
himself
that
he
would
see
what
kind
of
a
looking
house
they
did
live
in
any
way
it
was
only
no
odd
when
he
began
and
he
could
turn
off
if
he
wished
long
before
he
reached
as
he
drew
nearer
he
said
he
would
just
give
a
look
at
it
and
then
rush
by
but
was
a
house
so
much
larger
and
nicer
than
he
had
expected
that
he
stopped
to
collect
his
slow
rustic
thoughts
and
decide
whether
she
really
lived
there
or
whether
she
had
just
given
that
number
for
a
blind
he
did
not
know
why
he
should
think
that
though
she
was
dressed
well
enough
to
come
out
of
any
house
while
he
lingered
before
the
house
an
old
man
with
a
cane
in
his
hand
and
his
mouth
hanging
open
stopped
and
peered
through
his
spectacles
whose
glare
he
fixed
upon
lemuel
till
he
began
to
feel
himself
a
suspicious
character
the
old
man
did
not
say
anything
but
stood
faltering
upon
his
stick
and
now
and
then
gathering
up
his
lower
lip
as
if
he
were
going
to
speak
but
not
speaking
lemuel
cleared
his
throat
hmmn
is
this
a
i
do
know
crowed
the
old
man
in
a
high
senile
note
you
want
table
board
or
rooms
i
do
want
board
at
all
began
lemuel
again
what
crowed
the
old
man
and
he
put
up
his
hand
to
his
ear
people
were
beginning
to
put
their
heads
out
of
the
neighbouring
windows
and
to
walk
slowly
as
they
went
by
so
as
to
hear
what
he
and
the
old
man
were
saying
he
could
not
run
away
now
and
he
went
boldly
up
to
the
door
of
the
large
house
and
rang
a
girl
came
and
he
asked
her
with
a
flushed
face
if
miss
amanda
grier
boarded
there
somehow
he
could
not
bear
to
ask
for
miss
dudley
well
the
girl
said
she
here
as
if
that
might
be
a
different
thing
to
lemuel
altogether
oh
he
said
is
she
in
well
you
can
walk
in
said
the
girl
and
i
she
came
back
to
ask
who
shall
i
say
called
mr
barker
said
lemuel
and
then
glowed
with
shame
because
he
had
called
himself
mister
the
girl
did
not
come
back
but
she
hardly
seemed
gone
before
grier
came
into
the
room
he
did
not
know
whether
she
would
speak
to
him
but
she
was
as
pleasant
as
could
be
and
said
he
must
come
right
up
to
her
and
room
it
was
pretty
high
up
but
he
did
not
notice
the
stairs
grier
kept
talking
so
and
when
he
got
to
it
and
grier
dashed
the
door
open
and
told
him
to
walk
right
in
he
would
not
have
known
but
he
was
in
somebody
a
curtained
alcove
hid
the
bed
and
the
room
was
heated
by
a
cheerful
little
kerosene
stove
there
were
bright
folding
and
the
lid
of
the
washstand
had
a
cloth
on
it
that
came
down
to
the
floor
and
there
were
plants
in
the
window
there
was
a
mirror
on
the
wall
framed
in
black
walnut
with
gilt
moulding
inside
and
a
photograph
in
the
same
kind
of
frame
and
two
chromes
and
a
clock
on
a
bracket
statira
seemed
surprised
to
see
him
the
room
was
pretty
warm
and
her
face
was
flushed
he
said
it
was
quite
mild
out
and
she
said
was
it
then
she
ran
and
flung
up
the
window
and
said
why
so
it
was
and
that
she
had
been
in
the
house
all
day
and
had
not
noticed
the
weather
she
excused
herself
and
the
room
for
being
in
such
a
state
she
said
she
was
ashamed
to
be
caught
in
such
a
looking
dress
but
they
were
not
expecting
company
and
she
did
suppose
grier
would
have
given
her
time
to
put
the
room
to
rights
a
little
he
could
not
understand
why
she
said
all
this
for
the
whole
room
was
clean
and
statira
herself
was
beautifully
dressed
in
the
same
dress
that
she
had
worn
the
night
before
or
one
just
like
it
and
after
she
had
put
up
the
window
grier
said
dudley
do
you
want
to
kill
yourself
and
ran
and
pulled
aside
the
curtain
in
the
corner
and
took
down
the
dolman
from
among
other
clothes
that
hung
there
and
threw
it
on
shoulders
who
looked
as
pretty
as
a
pink
in
it
but
she
pretended
to
be
too
hot
and
wanted
to
shrug
it
off
and
grier
called
out
mr
barker
you
make
her
keep
it
on
and
lemuel
sat
dumb
and
motionless
but
filled
through
with
a
sweet
pleasure
he
tried
several
times
to
ask
them
if
they
had
been
robbed
on
the
way
home
last
night
as
he
had
done
in
the
scene
he
had
dramatised
but
he
could
not
get
out
a
word
except
that
it
had
been
pretty
warm
all
day
statira
said
i
think
it
been
a
very
warm
fall
and
grier
said
i
think
the
summer
goin
to
spend
the
winter
with
us
and
they
all
three
laughed
what
speeches
you
do
make
grier
said
statira
well
anything
better
than
quaker
meetin
say
retorted
grier
and
then
they
were
all
three
silent
and
lemuel
thought
of
his
clothes
and
how
fashionably
both
of
the
girls
were
dressed
i
guess
said
statira
it
be
a
pretty
sickly
winter
if
it
keeps
along
this
way
they
say
a
green
christmas
makes
a
fat
i
guess
you
see
the
snow
fly
long
before
christmas
said
grier
or
thanksgiving
i
guess
so
too
said
lemuel
though
he
did
not
like
to
seem
to
take
sides
against
statira
she
laughed
as
if
it
were
a
good
joke
and
said
but
about
a
fortnight
now
till
thanksgiving
if
it
comes
a
good
fall
of
snow
before
thanksgivin
wo
you
come
round
and
give
us
a
barker
asked
grier
they
all
laughed
at
her
audacity
and
lemuel
said
yes
he
would
and
she
said
we
give
you
a
piece
of
real
willoughby
centre
if
you
they
all
laughed
again
grier
said
statira
in
protest
her
folks
sent
her
half
a
dozen
last
thanksgivin
persisted
grier
pleaded
statira
grier
sprang
up
and
got
lemuel
a
you
ai
a
bit
comfortable
in
that
stiff
old
thing
lemuel
declared
that
he
was
perfectly
comfortable
but
she
would
not
be
contented
till
he
had
changed
and
then
she
said
why
do
you
look
after
your
company
dudley
i
should
think
you
be
lemuel
face
burned
with
happy
shame
and
statira
who
was
as
red
as
he
was
stole
a
look
at
him
that
seemed
to
say
that
there
was
no
use
trying
to
stop
grier
but
when
she
went
on
i
do
know
but
it
the
fashion
to
willoughby
centre
they
both
gave
way
again
and
laughed
more
than
ever
and
statira
said
grier
what
do
you
barker
think
she
tried
to
be
sober
but
the
wild
girl
set
her
and
lemuel
off
laughing
when
she
retorted
guess
he
think
what
he
did
when
he
was
brought
up
in
court
for
highway
grier
sat
upright
in
her
chair
and
acted
as
if
she
had
merely
spoken
about
the
weather
he
knew
that
she
was
talking
that
way
just
to
break
the
ice
and
though
he
would
have
given
anything
to
be
able
to
second
her
he
could
not
how
you
do
carry
on
grier
said
statira
as
helpless
as
he
was
guess
i
got
a
pretty
good
load
to
carry
said
grier
they
all
now
began
to
find
their
tongues
a
little
and
statira
told
how
one
season
when
her
mother
took
boarders
she
had
gone
over
to
the
pastures
with
a
party
of
on
a
and
picked
blueberries
she
said
she
never
saw
the
berries
as
thick
as
they
were
there
lemuel
said
he
guessed
he
knew
where
the
place
was
but
the
fire
had
got
into
it
last
year
and
there
had
not
been
a
berry
there
this
summer
statira
said
what
a
shame
she
said
there
were
some
barkers
over
east
willoughby
way
and
she
confessed
that
when
he
said
his
name
was
barker
and
he
was
from
willoughby
pastures
that
night
in
the
station
she
thought
she
should
have
gone
through
the
floor
then
they
talked
a
little
about
how
they
had
both
felt
but
not
very
much
and
they
each
took
all
the
blame
and
would
not
allow
that
the
other
was
the
least
to
blame
statira
said
she
had
behaved
like
a
perfect
coot
all
the
way
through
and
lemuel
said
that
he
guessed
he
had
been
the
coot
if
there
was
any
i
guess
there
was
a
pair
of
you
said
grier
and
at
this
association
of
them
in
grier
condemnation
he
could
see
that
statira
was
blushing
though
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
for
her
ears
were
all
red
he
now
rose
and
said
he
guessed
he
would
have
to
be
going
but
when
grier
interposed
and
asked
why
what
your
hurry
he
said
he
guessed
he
had
not
had
any
and
statira
laughed
at
the
wit
of
this
till
it
seemed
to
him
she
would
perish
well
then
you
set
right
straight
down
again
said
grier
with
mock
severity
as
if
he
were
an
obstinate
little
boy
and
he
obeyed
though
he
wished
that
statira
had
asked
him
to
stay
too
why
the
land
sakes
exclaimed
grier
have
you
been
him
keep
his
hat
all
this
while
dudley
you
take
it
right
away
from
him
and
statira
rose
all
smiling
and
blushing
and
said
will
you
let
me
take
your
hat
barker
as
if
he
had
just
come
in
and
made
him
feel
as
if
she
had
pressed
him
to
stay
she
took
it
and
went
and
laid
it
on
a
stand
across
the
room
and
lemuel
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
much
more
graceful
person
she
wore
a
full
breton
skirt
which
was
gathered
thickly
at
the
hips
and
swung
loose
and
free
as
she
stepped
when
she
came
back
and
sat
down
letting
the
back
of
one
pretty
hand
fall
into
the
palm
of
the
other
in
her
lap
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
that
such
an
elegant
young
lady
should
be
tolerating
a
person
dressed
as
he
was
there
began
grier
guess
barker
wo
object
a
great
deal
to
our
going
on
if
it
sunday
kind
of
a
sunday
game
anyways
you
to
games
on
sunday
i
do
know
as
i
am
said
lemuel
now
grier
do
you
pleaded
statira
shall
too
persisted
i
guess
if
there
any
harm
in
the
key
there
ai
any
harm
in
the
bible
and
so
it
comes
out
even
ever
try
your
fate
with
a
key
and
a
bible
she
asked
lemuel
i
do
know
as
i
did
he
answered
well
it
fun
its
curious
how
it
comes
out
well
do
there
anything
it
but
it
i
guess
we
had
better
said
statira
i
do
believe
barker
care
for
lemuel
said
he
would
like
to
see
how
it
was
done
anyway
grier
took
the
key
out
of
the
door
and
looked
at
it
that
key
cut
the
leaves
all
to
ca
you
find
some
other
suggested
statira
i
do
know
but
may
be
i
could
said
grier
you
just
wait
a
half
a
before
lemuel
knew
what
she
was
doing
she
flew
out
of
the
door
and
he
could
hear
her
flying
down
the
stairs
well
i
say
said
statira
and
then
neither
she
nor
lemuel
said
anything
for
a
little
while
at
last
she
asked
that
window
trouble
you
any
lemuel
said
not
at
all
and
he
added
perhaps
it
too
cold
for
you
oh
no
said
the
girl
i
ca
seem
to
get
anything
too
cold
for
me
i
the
greatest
person
for
cold
weather
i
glad
it
winter
we
had
the
greatest
last
winter
continued
statira
with
those
english
sparrows
used
to
feed
crumbs
there
on
the
and
it
seemed
as
if
they
got
to
know
we
girls
and
hop
right
inside
if
you
let
used
to
make
me
feel
kind
of
creepy
to
have
they
say
it
a
sign
of
death
to
have
a
bird
come
into
your
room
and
i
was
always
for
drivin
out
but
she
said
she
guessed
the
lord
did
take
the
trouble
to
send
birds
round
to
every
one
and
if
the
rule
did
work
one
way
it
did
work
the
other
you
believe
in
signs
i
do
know
as
i
do
much
mother
likes
to
see
the
new
moon
over
her
right
shoulder
pretty
well
said
lemuel
well
i
declare
said
statira
that
just
the
way
with
aunt
now
you
up
here
she
said
springing
suddenly
to
her
feet
i
want
you
should
see
what
a
nice
view
we
got
from
our
lemuel
had
it
on
his
tongue
to
say
that
he
hoped
it
was
not
going
to
be
his
last
chance
he
believed
he
would
have
said
it
if
grier
had
been
there
but
now
he
only
joined
statira
at
the
window
and
looked
out
they
had
to
stoop
over
and
get
pretty
close
together
to
see
the
things
she
wished
to
show
him
and
she
kept
shrugging
her
sack
on
and
once
she
touched
him
with
her
shoulder
he
said
yes
to
everything
she
asked
him
about
the
view
but
he
saw
very
little
of
it
he
saw
that
her
hair
had
a
shade
of
gold
in
its
brown
and
that
it
curled
in
tight
little
rings
where
it
was
cut
on
her
neck
and
that
her
skin
was
very
white
under
it
when
she
touched
him
that
time
it
made
him
feel
very
strange
and
when
she
glanced
at
him
out
of
her
blue
eyes
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
he
did
not
laugh
as
he
did
when
grier
was
there
statira
said
oh
excuse
me
when
she
touched
him
and
he
answered
perfectly
excusable
but
he
said
hardly
anything
else
he
liked
to
hear
her
talk
and
he
watched
the
play
of
her
lips
as
she
spoke
once
her
breath
came
across
his
cheek
when
she
turned
quickly
to
see
if
he
was
looking
where
she
was
pointing
they
sat
down
and
talked
and
all
at
once
statira
exclaimed
i
should
think
grier
was
that
key
now
whatever
happened
lemuel
was
bound
to
say
i
do
think
been
gone
very
well
you
pretty
patient
i
say
said
statira
and
he
did
not
know
whether
she
was
making
fun
of
him
or
not
he
tried
to
think
of
something
to
say
but
could
not
i
hope
she
fetch
a
lamp
too
when
she
comes
statira
went
on
and
now
he
saw
that
it
was
beginning
to
be
a
little
darker
perhaps
that
about
the
lamp
was
a
hint
for
him
to
go
but
he
did
not
see
exactly
how
he
could
go
till
grier
came
back
he
felt
that
it
would
not
be
polite
well
there
said
statira
as
if
she
divined
his
feeling
i
shall
give
grier
a
i
awfully
afraid
we
keeping
you
not
at
all
said
lemuel
i
afraid
i
keeping
oh
not
at
all
said
statira
she
became
rather
quieter
till
grier
came
back
grier
burst
into
the
room
with
a
key
in
one
hand
and
a
lamp
in
the
other
well
i
knew
you
two
be
holdin
quaker
we
hai
at
all
how
know
we
have
have
we
barker
returned
statira
in
simultaneous
admission
and
denial
well
if
you
want
to
know
i
listened
outside
the
door
said
grier
and
you
sayin
a
word
either
of
you
i
guess
i
got
a
key
now
that
do
she
added
setting
down
her
lamp
and
i
borrowed
an
old
bible
i
guess
to
hurt
a
great
i
do
know
as
i
want
to
play
it
much
said
statira
well
i
guess
you
got
to
now
said
grier
after
all
my
trouble
hai
she
barker
it
flattered
lemuel
through
and
through
to
be
appealed
to
but
he
could
not
say
anything
well
said
statira
if
i
got
to
i
got
to
but
you
got
to
hold
the
you
got
to
put
the
key
in
cried
grier
she
sat
holding
the
bible
open
toward
statira
she
offered
to
put
the
key
in
and
then
she
stopped
well
i
great
who
are
we
going
to
find
it
for
first
oh
company
first
said
grier
you
company
barker
asked
statira
looking
at
lemuel
over
her
shoulder
i
hope
not
said
lemuel
gallantly
at
last
well
i
declare
said
statira
quite
one
the
family
said
grier
and
that
made
statira
say
and
lemuel
blush
to
his
hair
well
anyway
continued
grier
you
company
enough
to
have
your
fate
found
first
put
in
the
key
no
i
do
well
shall
then
she
took
the
key
from
statira
and
shut
the
book
upon
it
at
the
song
of
solomon
and
bound
it
tightly
in
with
a
ribbon
lemuel
watched
breathlessly
he
was
not
sure
that
he
knew
what
kind
of
fate
she
meant
but
he
thought
he
knew
and
it
made
his
heart
beat
quick
grier
had
passed
the
ribbon
through
the
ring
of
the
key
which
was
left
outside
of
the
leaves
and
now
she
took
hold
of
the
key
with
her
two
forefingers
you
got
to
be
careful
not
to
touch
the
bible
with
your
fingers
she
explained
or
the
charm
wo
work
now
i
say
over
two
verses
where
the
key
put
in
and
barker
you
got
to
repeat
the
alphabet
at
the
same
time
and
when
it
comes
to
the
first
letter
of
the
right
name
the
bible
will
drop
out
of
my
fingers
all
i
can
do
now
then
me
as
a
seal
on
thine
a
b
c
began
lemuel
pshaw
now
grier
you
stop
pleaded
statira
you
be
still
go
on
mr
barker
a
seal
upon
thine
arm
for
love
is
as
strong
as
do
say
the
letters
so
fast
as
cruel
as
the
do
look
at
look
at
me
coals
thereof
are
coals
of
you
sayin
it
too
slow
now
hath
a
most
vehement
i
declare
dudley
if
you
joggle
me
waters
can
not
quench
love
neither
can
the
floods
drown
you
must
put
just
so
much
time
between
every
letter
if
you
stop
on
every
particular
one
it
ai
fair
a
man
would
give
all
the
substance
of
his
house
for
you
stop
laughin
you
two
would
be
utterly
well
there
now
we
got
to
go
it
all
over
again
and
my
most
broke
i
do
believe
barker
wants
to
do
it
again
said
statira
looking
demurely
at
him
but
lemuel
protested
that
he
did
and
the
game
began
again
this
time
the
bible
began
to
shake
at
the
letter
d
and
statira
cried
out
now
grier
you
making
it
and
grier
laughed
so
that
she
could
scarcely
hold
the
book
lemuel
laughed
too
but
he
kept
on
repeating
the
letters
at
s
the
book
fell
to
the
floor
and
statira
caught
it
up
and
softly
beat
grier
on
the
back
with
it
oh
you
mean
thing
she
cried
out
you
did
it
on
grier
was
almost
choked
with
laughing
do
you
know
anybody
of
the
name
of
sarah
barker
she
gasped
and
then
they
all
laughed
together
till
statira
said
well
i
shall
surely
die
now
grier
it
your
turn
and
you
see
if
i
do
pay
you
i
guess
i
ai
afraid
any
retorted
grier
the
book
do
what
it
pleases
in
spite
of
they
began
again
statira
holding
the
book
this
time
and
lemuel
repeating
as
before
and
he
went
quite
through
the
alphabet
without
anything
happening
well
i
declare
said
statira
looking
grave
let
try
it
over
you
may
try
and
you
may
try
and
you
may
try
said
grier
it
wo
do
you
any
good
i
hai
got
any
fate
in
that
well
that
what
we
goin
to
find
out
said
statira
but
again
the
verses
and
alphabet
were
repeated
without
effect
now
you
satisfied
asked
grier
no
not
yet
begin
again
barker
he
did
so
and
at
the
second
letter
the
book
dropped
statira
jumped
up
and
grier
began
to
chase
her
round
the
room
to
box
her
ears
for
her
she
said
lemuel
sat
looking
on
he
did
not
feel
at
all
severe
toward
them
as
he
usually
did
toward
girls

while

said
statira
and
she
hastened
to
add
the
name
i
mean
and
at
this
they
all
laughed
till
statira
said
i
shall

she
suddenly
recovered
herself
those
girls
seemed
to
do
everything
like
lightning
lemuel
observed
and
said
no
i
ai
goin
to
have
mine
told
at
all
i
like
it
seems
kind
of
wicked
i
ruther

i
never
make
it
just
right
to

so
with
the
lemuel
was
pleased
at
that
statira
seemed
prettier
than
ever
in
this
mood
of
reverence
well
do
talk
too
much
when
i
gone
said
grier
and
before
anybody
could
stop
her
she
ran
out
of
the
room
but
she
put
her
head
in
again
to
say
i
be
back
as
soon
i
can
take
this
key
lemuel
did
not
know
what
to
do
the
thought
of
being
alone
with
statira
again
was
full
of
rapture
and
terror
he
was
glad
when
she
seized
the
door
and
tried
to
keep
grier
i
i
guess
i
better
be
going
he
said
you
go
till
i
get
back
anyway
said
grier
hospitably
you
keep
him
she
gave
statira
a
little
push
and
ran
down
the
stairs
statira
tottered
against
lemuel
with
that
round
soft
shoulder
which
had
touched
him
before
he
put
out
his
arms
to
save
her
from
falling
and
they
seemed
to
close
round
her
of
themselves
she
threw
up
her
face
and
in
a
moment
he
had
kissed
her
he
released
her
and
fell
back
from
her
aghast
she
looked
at
him
i
i
did
mean
to
he
panted
his
heart
was
thundering
in
his
ears
she
put
up
her
hands
to
her
face
and
began
to
cry
oh
my
goodness
he
gasped
he
wavered
a
moment
then
he
ran
out
of
the
room
on
the
stairs
he
met
grier
coming
up
now
barker
real
mean
to
go
she
pouted
i
guess
i
better
be
going
lemuel
called
back
in
a
voice
so
husky
that
he
hardly
knew
it
for
his
own
xii
lemuel
let
himself
into
miss
vane
house
with
his
key
to
the
back
gate
and
sat
down
still
throbbing
in
his
room
over
the
l
and
tried
to
get
the
nature
of
his
deed
or
misdeed
before
his
mind
he
had
grown
up
to
manhood
in
an
austere
reverence
for
himself
as
regarded
the
other
sex
and
in
a
secret
fear
as
exacting
for
them
as
it
was
worshipful
of
women
his
mother
had
held
all
show
of
between
young
people
in
scorn
she
said
they
were
silly
things
when
she
saw
them
soft
upon
one
another
and
lemuel
had
imbibed
from
her
a
sense
of
unlawfulness
of
shame
in
the
he
had
seen
around
him
all
his
life
these
things
are
very
open
in
the
country
even
in
large
villages
they
have
at
the
children
parties
in
the
church
vestries
and
refectories
and
as
a
little
boy
lemuel
had
taken
part
in
such
games
but
as
he
grew
older
his
reverence
and
his
fear
would
not
let
him
touch
a
girl
once
a
big
girl
much
older
than
he
came
up
behind
him
in
the
and
kissed
him
he
rubbed
the
kiss
off
with
his
hand
and
scoured
the
place
with
sand
and
gravel
one
winter
all
the
big
boys
and
girls
at
school
began
courting
whenever
the
teacher
was
out
of
sight
a
moment
at
the
some
of
them
sat
with
their
arms
round
one
another
lemuel
wandered
off
by
himself
in
the
snows
of
the
deep
woods
the
sight
of
such
things
the
thought
of
them
put
him
to
shame
for
those
fools
as
he
tacitly
called
them
and
now
what
had
he
done
himself
he
could
not
tell
at
times
he
was
even
proud
and
glad
of
it
and
then
he
did
not
know
what
would
become
of
him
but
mostly
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
guilty
of
an
enormity
that
nothing
could
ever
excuse
he
must
have
been
crazy
to
do
such
a
thing
to
a
young
lady
like
that
her
face
looked
her
wonder
at
him
still
by
this
time
she
had
told
grier
all
about
it
and
he
dared
not
think
what
their
thoughts
of
him
must
be
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
ought
to
put
such
a
monster
as
he
was
out
of
the
world
but
all
the
time
there
was
a
sweetness
a
joy
in
his
heart
that
made
him
half
frantic
with
fear
of
himself
lemuel
he
started
up
at
the
sound
of
sibyl
vane
voice
calling
to
him
from
the
which
opened
into
the
yes
he
answered
tremulously
going
to
his
door
miss
vane
had
been
obliged
to
instruct
him
to
say
to
her
niece
whom
he
had
at
first
spoken
of
by
her
christian
name
was
that
you
came
in
a
little
while
ago
yes
i
came
oh
and
have
you
had
your
supper
i
i
guess
i
do
want
any
do
want
any
supper
you
will
be
why
do
you
i
do
know
as
i
feel
just
like
eating
well
it
wo
do
will
you
see
please
if
jane
is
in
the
kitchen
lemuel
came
forward
full
of
his
unfitness
for
the
sight
of
men
but
gathering
a
little
courage
when
he
found
the
so
dark
he
descended
to
the
basement
and
opened
the
door
of
the
kitchen
looked
in
and
shut
it
again
yes
she
oh
sibyl
seemed
to
hesitate
then
she
said
light
the
gas
down
there
had
you
better
i
do
know
but
i
had
lemuel
assented
but
before
he
could
obey
and
lemuel
she
called
down
again
come
and
light
it
up
here
too
i
will
as
soon
as
i
lit
it
here
said
lemuel
an
imperious
order
came
back
you
will
light
it
here
all
right
assented
lemuel
when
he
appeared
in
the
upper
entry
and
flashed
the
gas
up
he
saw
sibyl
standing
at
the
door
with
her
finger
closed
into
a
book
which
she
had
been
reading
you
not
to
say
that
you
will
do
one
thing
when
you
told
to
do
lemuel
whitened
a
little
round
the
lips
i
not
to
do
two
things
at
once
either
i
sibyl
ignored
this
reply
please
go
and
get
your
supper
and
when
you
had
it
come
up
here
again
i
some
things
for
you
to
i
do
them
now
said
lemuel
fiercely
i
do
want
any
supper
and
i
eat
why
lemuel
what
is
the
matter
with
you
asked
the
girl
in
the
sudden
effect
of
motherly
solicitude
you
look
very
strange
you
seem
so
i
not
hungry
that
all
said
the
boy
doggedly
what
is
it
you
want
done
wo
you
please
go
up
to
the
third
floor
said
sibyl
in
a
phase
of
timorous
dependence
and
see
if
everything
is
right
there
i
thought
i
heard
a
noise
see
if
the
windows
are
fast
wo
you
lemuel
turned
and
she
followed
with
her
finger
in
her
book
and
her
book
pressed
to
her
heart
talking
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
heard
steps
and
voices
it
very
mysterious
i
suppose
any
one
could
plant
a
ladder
on
the
roof
of
the
l
part
and
get
into
the
windows
if
they
were
not
have
to
be
a
pretty
long
ladder
grumbled
lemuel
yes
sibyl
assented
it
would
and
it
did
sound
exactly
like
she
followed
him
up
the
second
flight
of
stairs
and
stood
there
while
he
explored
the
third
story
throughout
there
ai
anything
there
he
reported
without
looking
at
her
and
was
about
to
pass
her
on
the
stairs
in
going
down
oh
thank
you
very
much
lemuel
she
said
with
fervent
gratitude
in
her
voice
she
fetched
a
tremulous
sigh
i
suppose
it
was
nothing
yes
she
added
hoarsely
it
must
have
been
nothing
oh
let
go
down
first
she
cried
putting
out
her
hand
to
stop
him
from
passing
her
she
resumed
when
they
reached
the
ground
floor
again
aunty
has
gone
out
and
jane
was
in
the
kitchen
and
it
began
to
grow
dark
while
i
sat
reading
in
the
and
all
at
once
i
heard
the
strangest
her
voice
dropped
deeply
on
the
last
word
yes
it
was
very
strange
indeed
thank
you
lemuel
she
concluded
quite
welcome
said
lemuel
dryly
pushing
on
towards
the
basement
stairs
oh
and
lemuel
will
you
let
jane
give
you
your
supper
in
the
so
that
you
could
be
here
if
i
heard
anything
else
i
do
want
any
supper
said
lemuel
the
girl
scrutinised
him
with
an
expression
of
misgiving
then
with
a
little
sigh
as
of
one
who
will
not
explore
a
painful
mystery
she
asked
would
you
mind
sitting
in
the
then
till
aunty
gets
back
i
just
as
lives
sit
there
said
lemuel
walking
into
the
dark
and
sitting
down
oh
thank
you
very
much
aunty
will
be
back
very
soon
i
suppose
just
gone
to
the
sewells
to
she
followed
him
to
the
threshold
you
must
i
must
light
the
gas
in
here
for
guess
i
can
light
the
gas
said
lemuel
getting
up
to
intercept
her
in
this
service
she
had
run
into
the
for
a
match
and
she
would
not
suffer
him
to
prevent
her
no
no
i
insist
and
lemuel
she
said
turning
upon
him
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
my
speaking
harshly
to
you
i
was
perfectly
excusable
said
lemuel
i
am
afraid
said
the
girl
fixing
him
with
her
eyes
that
you
are
not
oh
yes
i
well
i
pretty
tired
that
have
you
been
walking
far
yes
not
the
walking
ought
to
do
you
good
said
sibyl
with
serious
thoughtfulness
i
think
she
continued
you
had
better
have
some
bryonia
do
you
think
you
had
no
no
i
do
want
anything
protested
lemuel
she
looked
at
him
with
a
feeling
of
baffled
anxiety
painted
on
her
face
and
as
she
turned
away
she
beamed
with
a
fresh
inspiration
i
will
get
you
a
she
flew
into
the
and
back
again
but
she
only
had
the
book
that
she
had
herself
been
reading
perhaps
you
would
like
to
read
this
i
finished
it
i
was
just
looking
back
through
thank
you
i
guess
i
do
want
to
read
any
just
she
leaned
against
the
side
of
the
beyond
which
lemuel
sat
and
searched
his
fallen
countenance
with
a
glance
contrived
to
be
at
once
piercing
and
reproachful
i
see
she
said
you
have
not
forgiven
forgiven
you
repeated
lemuel
blankly
yes
for
giving
way
to
my
agitation
in
speaking
to
i
do
know
said
lemuel
with
a
sigh
of
deep
inward
trouble
as
i
noticed
i
told
you
to
light
the
gas
in
the
basement
suggested
sibyl
and
then
i
told
you
to
light
it
up
here
and
then
i
scolded
oh
yes
admitted
lemuel
he
dropped
his
head
again
sibyl
sank
upon
the
edge
of
a
chair
lemuel
you
have
something
on
your
mind
the
boy
looked
up
with
a
startled
face
yes
i
can
see
that
you
have
pursued
sibyl
what
have
you
been
doing
she
demanded
sternly
lemuel
was
so
full
of
the
truth
that
it
came
first
to
his
lips
in
all
cases
he
could
scarcely
force
it
aside
now
with
the
evasion
that
availed
him
nothing
i
do
know
as
i
been
doing
anything
in
i
see
that
you
do
wish
to
tell
me
cried
the
girl
but
you
might
have
trusted
me
i
would
have
defended
you
no
matter
what
you
had
done
the
worse
the
lemuel
hung
his
head
without
answering
after
a
while
she
continued
if
i
had
been
that
girl
who
had
you
arrested
and
i
had
been
the
cause
of
so
much
suffering
to
an
innocent
person
i
should
never
have
forgiven
myself
i
should
have
devoted
my
life
to
expiation
i
should
have
spent
my
life
in
going
about
the
prisons
and
finding
out
persons
who
were
unjustly
accused
i
should
have
done
it
as
a
penance
yes
even
if
he
had
been
guilty
lemuel
remained
insensible
to
this
extreme
of
and
she
went
on
this
book
it
is
a
story
is
all
one
picture
of
such
a
nature
there
is
a
girl
who
been
brought
up
as
the
ward
of
a
young
man
he
educates
her
and
she
expects
to
be
his
wife
and
he
turns
out
to
be
perfectly
false
and
unworthy
in
every
way
but
she
marries
him
all
the
same
although
she
likes
some
one
else
because
she
feels
that
she
ought
to
punish
herself
for
thinking
of
another
and
because
she
hopes
that
she
will
die
soon
and
when
her
guardian
finds
out
what
she
done
for
him
it
will
reform
him
it
perfectly
sublime
it
ennobling
if
every
one
could
read
this
book
they
would
be
very
i
do
see
much
sense
in
it
said
lemuel
goaded
to
this
comment
you
would
if
you
read
it
when
she
dies
she
is
killed
by
a
fall
from
her
horse
in
hunting
and
has
just
time
to
join
the
hands
of
her
husband
and
the
man
she
liked
first
and
tell
them
everything
it
is
wrought
up
so
that
you
hold
your
breath
i
suppose
it
was
reading
that
that
made
me
think
there
were
burglars
getting
in
but
perhaps
you
right
not
to
read
it
now
if
you
excited
already
i
get
you
something
she
whirled
out
of
the
room
and
back
in
a
series
of
those
swift
nervous
movements
peculiar
to
her
there
that
will
amuse
you
i
she
put
the
book
down
on
the
table
before
lemuel
who
silently
submitted
to
have
it
left
there
it
will
distract
your
thoughts
if
anything
will
and
i
shall
ask
you
to
let
me
sit
just
here
in
the
so
that
i
can
call
you
if
i
feel
all
right
said
lemuel
lapsing
absently
to
his
own
troubled
thoughts
thank
you
very
much
said
sibyl
she
went
away
and
came
back
directly
do
you
think
she
asked
that
it
very
strange
you
should
never
have
seen
or
heard
anything
of
her
heard
of
who
he
asked
dragging
himself
painfully
up
from
the
depths
of
his
thoughts
that
heartless
girl
who
had
you
she
heartless
retorted
lemuel
indignantly
you
think
so
because
you
are
generous
and
ca
imagine
such
heartlessness
perhaps
added
sibyl
with
the
air
of
being
illumined
by
a
happy
thought
she
is
dead
that
would
account
for
everything
she
may
have
died
of
remorse
it
probably
preyed
upon
her
till
she
bear
it
any
longer
and
then
she
killed
lemuel
began
to
grow
red
at
the
first
apprehension
of
her
meaning
as
she
went
on
he
changed
colour
more
and
more
she
is
alive
cried
sibyl
she
alive
and
you
have
seen
her
you
need
deny
it
you
seen
her
lemuel
rose
in
clumsy
indignation
i
do
know
as
anybody
got
any
right
to
say
what
done
or
have
o
lemuel
cried
sibyl
do
you
think
anyone
in
this
house
would
intrude
in
your
affairs
but
if
you
need
a
friend
a
sister
i
do
need
any
sister
i
want
you
should
let
me
at
these
words
so
little
appreciative
of
her
condescension
her
romantic
beneficence
her
unselfish
interest
sibyl
suddenly
rebounded
to
her
former
level
which
she
was
sensible
was
far
above
that
of
this
unworthy
object
of
her
kindness
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
pursued
if
you
need
a
friend
a
sister
i
sure
that
you
can
safely
confide
in
the
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
broke
into
a
malicious
laugh
very
unlike
that
of
a
social
reformer
which
rang
shriller
at
the
bovine
fury
which
mounted
to
lemuel
eyes
the
rattle
of
a
made
itself
heard
in
the
outer
door
sibyl
voice
began
to
break
as
it
rose
i
never
expected
to
be
treated
in
my
own
aunt
house
with
such
perfect
ingratitude
and
impudence
yes
impudence
by
one
of
her
servants
she
swept
out
of
the
room
and
her
aunt
who
entered
it
after
calling
to
her
in
vain
stood
with
lemuel
and
heard
her
mount
the
stairs
sobbing
to
her
own
room
and
lock
herself
in
what
is
the
matter
lemuel
asked
miss
vane
breathing
quickly
she
looked
at
him
with
the
air
of
a
judge
who
would
not
condemn
him
unheard
but
would
certainly
do
so
after
hearing
him
whether
it
was
perception
of
this
that
kept
him
silent
or
his
confusion
of
spirit
from
all
the
late
rapidly
successive
events
or
a
wish
not
to
inculpate
the
girl
who
had
insulted
him
he
remained
silent
answer
me
said
miss
vane
sharply
lemuel
cleared
his
throat
i
do
know
as
i
got
anything
to
say
he
answered
finally
but
i
insist
upon
your
saying
something
said
miss
vane
what
is
this
there
has
been
any
impudence
replied
lemuel
hanging
his
head
very
well
then
you
can
tell
me
what
sibyl
means
persisted
miss
vane
lemuel
seemed
to
reflect
upon
it
no
i
ca
tell
you
he
said
at
last
slowly
and
gently
you
refuse
to
make
any
explanation
whatever
miss
vane
rose
from
the
chair
which
she
had
mechanically
sunk
into
while
waiting
for
him
to
speak
and
ceased
to
be
the
kindly
generous
soul
she
was
in
asserting
herself
as
a
gentlewoman
who
had
a
contumacious
servant
to
treat
with
you
will
wait
here
a
moment
all
right
said
lemuel
she
had
asked
him
not
to
receive
instructions
from
her
with
that
particular
answer
but
he
could
not
always
remember
she
went
upstairs
and
returned
with
some
banknotes
that
rustled
in
her
trembling
hand
it
is
two
months
since
you
came
and
i
paid
you
one
month
she
said
and
she
set
her
lips
and
tried
to
govern
her
head
which
nevertheless
shook
with
the
vehemence
she
was
struggling
to
repress
she
laid
two
notes
upon
the
table
and
then
added
a
five
a
little
apart
this
second
month
was
to
be
twenty
instead
of
ten
i
shall
not
want
you
any
longer
and
should
be
glad
to
have
you
go
now
at
once
but
i
had
intended
to
offer
you
a
little
present
at
christmas
and
i
will
give
it
you
lemuel
took
up
the
two
notes
without
saying
anything
and
then
after
a
moment
laid
one
of
them
down
it
only
half
a
month
he
said
i
do
want
to
be
paid
for
any
more
than
i
lemuel
cried
miss
vane
i
insist
upon
your
taking
it
i
employed
you
by
the
it
do
make
any
difference
about
that
i
only
been
here
a
month
and
a
he
folded
the
notes
and
turned
to
go
out
of
the
room
miss
vane
caught
the
note
from
the
table
and
intercepted
him
with
it
well
then
you
shall
take
it
as
a
i
do
want
any
present
said
lemuel
patiently
waiting
her
pleasure
to
release
him
but
keeping
his
hands
in
his
pockets
you
would
have
taken
it
at
christmas
said
miss
vane
you
shall
take
it
i
should
take
a
present
any
time
returned
lemuel
steadily
you
are
a
foolish
boy
cried
miss
vane
you
need
it
and
i
tell
you
to
take
he
made
no
reply
whatever
you
are
behaving
very
stubbornly
ungratefully
said
miss
vane
lemuel
lifted
his
head
his
lip
quivered
a
little
i
do
think
got
any
right
to
say
i
i
do
mean
ungrateful
said
miss
vane
i
mean
unkind
very
silly
indeed
and
i
wish
you
to
take
this
money
you
are
behaving
resentfully
wickedly
i
am
much
older
than
you
and
i
tell
you
that
you
are
not
behaving
rightly
why
do
you
do
what
i
wish
i
do
want
any
money
i
have
i
do
mean
the
money
why
do
you
tell
me
the
meaning
of
what
i
heard
my
niece
said
you
had
been
impudent
to
her
perhaps
she
she
looked
wistfully
into
the
boy
face
after
a
long
time
he
said
i
do
know
as
i
got
anything
to
say
about
very
well
then
you
may
go
said
miss
vane
with
all
her
well
good
evening
said
lemuel
passively
but
the
eyes
that
he
looked
at
her
with
were
moist
and
conveyed
a
pathetic
reproach
to
her
unmeasured
astonishment
he
offered
her
his
hand
her
amaze
was
even
greater
infinite
as
she
afterwards
told
sewell
when
she
found
herself
shaking
it
he
went
out
of
the
room
and
she
heard
him
walking
about
his
room
in
the
l
putting
together
his
few
belongings
then
she
heard
him
go
down
and
open
the
furnace
door
and
she
knew
he
was
giving
a
final
conscientious
look
at
the
fire
he
closed
it
and
she
heard
him
close
the
basement
door
behind
him
and
knew
that
he
was
gone
she
explored
the
l
and
then
she
descended
to
the
basement
and
mechanically
looked
it
over
everything
that
could
be
counted
hers
by
the
most
fastidious
sense
of
property
had
been
left
behind
him
in
the
utmost
neatness
on
their
accustomed
nail
just
inside
the
hung
the
blue
overalls
they
looked
like
a
suicidal
lemuel
hanging
there
miss
vane
went
upstairs
slowly
with
a
heavy
heart
under
the
hall
light
stood
sibyl
picturesque
in
the
deep
shadow
it
flung
upon
her
face
aunt
hope
she
began
in
a
tragic
voice
do
to
me
you
wicked
girl
cried
her
aunt
venting
her
upon
this
victim
it
is
sibyl
turned
with
the
meekness
of
an
ostentatious
unjustly
bearing
the
sins
of
her
tribe
and
went
upstairs
into
the
wilderness
of
her
own
thoughts
again
xiii
the
sense
of
outrage
with
which
lemuel
was
boiling
when
miss
vane
came
in
upon
sibyl
and
himself
had
wholly
passed
away
and
he
now
saw
his
dismissal
unjust
as
between
that
girl
and
him
unimpeachably
righteous
as
between
him
and
the
moral
frame
of
things
if
he
had
been
punished
for
being
ready
to
take
advantage
of
that
fellow
necessity
and
charge
him
fifty
cents
for
changing
ten
dollars
he
must
now
be
no
less
obviously
suffering
for
having
abused
that
young
lady
trust
and
defencelessness
only
he
was
not
suffering
as
much
when
he
recurred
to
that
wrong
in
fact
and
tried
to
feel
sorry
for
it
and
ashamed
his
heart
thrilled
in
a
curious
way
he
found
himself
smiling
and
exulting
and
miss
vane
and
her
niece
went
out
of
his
mind
and
he
could
not
think
of
anything
but
of
being
with
that
girl
of
hearing
her
talk
and
laugh
of
touching
her
he
sighed
he
did
not
know
what
his
mother
would
say
if
she
knew
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
going
it
seemed
a
hundred
years
since
the
beginning
of
the
afternoon
a
came
by
and
lemuel
stopped
it
he
set
his
bag
down
on
the
platform
and
stood
there
near
the
conductor
without
trying
to
go
inside
for
the
bag
was
pretty
large
and
he
did
not
believe
the
conductor
would
let
him
take
it
in
the
conductor
said
politely
after
a
while
see
i
get
your
fare
no
said
lemuel
he
paid
and
the
conductor
went
inside
and
collected
the
other
fares
when
he
came
back
he
took
advantage
of
lemuel
continued
presence
to
have
a
little
chat
he
was
a
short
plump
man
and
he
looked
strong
and
well
but
he
said
with
an
introductory
sigh
well
sir
i
get
sore
all
over
at
this
business
there
ai
a
bone
in
me
that
hai
got
an
ache
in
it
sometimes
i
ca
tell
but
what
it
the
ache
got
a
bone
in
it
ache
seems
the
why
what
makes
it
asked
lemuel
absently
oh
it
this
standin
it
the
hours
and
changin
the
hours
so
much
you
hai
got
a
chance
to
get
used
to
one
set
o
hours
before
they
get
all
shifted
round
again
last
week
i
was
on
from
eight
to
eight
this
week
it
from
twelve
to
twelve
lord
knows
what
it
going
to
be
next
week
and
this
is
one
o
the
best
lines
in
town
i
presume
they
pay
you
pretty
well
said
lemuel
with
awakening
interest
well
they
pay
a
dollar
half
a
day
said
the
conductor
why
it
more
than
forty
dollars
a
month
said
lemuel
well
it
is
said
the
conductor
scornfully
if
you
work
every
day
in
the
week
but
i
ca
stand
it
more
than
six
days
out
o
seven
and
if
you
miss
a
day
or
if
you
miss
a
trip
they
dock
you
no
sir
about
the
meanest
business
ever
struck
if
i
a
married
man
if
i
did
like
to
be
regular
about
my
meals
and
get
at
home
my
wife
i
would
stand
it
a
minute
but
that
where
it
is
a
lady
from
within
signalled
the
conductor
he
stopped
the
car
and
the
lady
who
had
risen
with
her
escort
remained
chatting
with
a
friend
before
she
got
out
the
conductor
snapped
his
bell
for
starting
with
a
look
of
patient
sarcasm
see
that
he
asked
lemuel
some
these
women
act
as
if
the
cars
was
their
private
carriage
and
got
to
act
so
or
the
lady
complains
of
you
and
the
company
bounces
you
in
a
minute
stock
owned
along
the
line
and
they
think
they
own
too
you
ca
get
to
set
more
than
ten
on
a
side
they
leave
the
car
first
i
like
to
catch
on
some
the
south
end
or
cambridge
cars
i
show
how
to
pack
live
stock
once
anyway
yes
sir
these
ladies
that
ride
on
this
line
think
they
can
keep
the
car
standin
while
they
talk
about
the
opera
but
you
ought
to
see
how
they
all
look
if
a
woman
tries
their
little
game
oh
i
tell
you
rich
people
are
lemuel
reflected
upon
the
generalisation
he
regarded
miss
vane
as
a
rich
person
but
though
she
had
blamed
him
unjustly
and
had
used
him
impatiently
even
cruelly
in
this
last
affair
he
remembered
other
things
and
he
said
well
i
do
know
as
i
should
say
all
of
them
were
well
may
be
not
admitted
the
conductor
but
i
do
envy
the
way
i
look
at
it
and
the
way
i
tell
my
wife
i
would
want
their
money
i
had
to
have
the
rest
of
it
ai
any
of
happy
i
saw
that
when
i
lived
out
no
sir
what
me
and
my
wife
want
to
do
is
to
find
us
a
nice
little
place
in
the
at
the
words
a
vision
of
willoughby
pastures
rose
upon
lemuel
and
a
lump
of
came
into
his
throat
he
saw
the
old
house
crouching
black
within
its
walls
under
the
cold
november
stars
if
his
mother
had
not
gone
to
bed
yet
she
was
sitting
beside
the
in
the
kitchen
and
perhaps
his
sister
was
brewing
something
on
it
potion
or
lotion
for
her
husband
rheumatism
miss
vane
had
talked
to
him
about
his
mother
she
had
said
he
might
have
her
down
to
visit
him
if
everything
went
on
right
but
of
course
he
knew
that
miss
vane
did
not
understand
that
his
mother
wore
bloomers
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
her
invitation
was
never
to
be
accepted
at
the
same
time
he
had
determined
to
ask
miss
vane
to
let
him
go
up
and
see
his
mother
some
sunday
fur
we
go
said
the
conductor
you
goin
on
you
want
to
take
another
car
i
guess
i
go
back
with
you
a
little
ways
said
lemuel
i
want
to
ask
you
guess
we
have
to
take
a
back
seat
then
said
the
conductor
leading
the
way
through
the
car
to
the
other
platform
or
a
standee
he
added
snapping
the
bell
what
is
it
you
want
to
ask
oh
nothing
how
do
you
fellows
learn
to
be
conductors
how
long
does
it
take
you
till
other
passengers
should
come
the
conductor
lounged
against
the
guard
of
the
platform
in
a
conversational
posture
well
generally
it
takes
you
four
or
five
days
you
got
to
learn
all
the
cross
streets
and
the
principal
places
on
all
the
yes
it
did
take
me
two
boston
yes
said
lemuel
with
a
fine
discouragement
i
presume
the
conductors
are
mostly
from
they
from
everywhere
and
some
of
are
pretty
streaked
i
can
tell
you
and
then
the
rest
of
us
has
got
to
suffer
throws
suspicion
on
all
of
us
one
fellow
gets
to
stealin
fares
and
then
everybody
got
to
wear
a
i
never
hear
mine
go
without
thinkin
it
says
thief
makes
me
sick
i
can
tell
after
a
while
lemuel
asked
how
do
you
get
such
a
position
the
conductor
seemed
to
be
thinking
about
some
thing
else
it
a
pretty
queer
kind
of
a
world
anyway
the
way
everybody
mixed
up
with
everybody
else
what
the
reason
if
a
man
wants
to
steal
he
steal
and
suffer
for
it
himself
without
throwin
the
shame
and
the
blame
on
a
lot
more
people
that
never
thought
o
stealin
i
notice
much
when
a
fellow
sets
out
to
do
right
that
folks
think
everybody
else
is
on
the
square
no
sir
they
do
seem
to
consider
that
kind
of
complaint
so
catching
now
you
take
another
thing
a
woman
goes
round
with
the
scarlet
fever
in
her
clothes
and
a
whole
carful
of
people
take
it
home
to
their
children
but
let
a
nice
young
girl
get
in
fresh
as
an
apple
and
a
perfect
daisy
for
wholesomeness
every
way
and
she
do
give
it
to
a
single
soul
on
board
no
sir
it
a
world
i
ca
see
through
nor
begin
i
never
thought
of
it
that
way
said
lemuel
darkened
by
this
black
pessimism
of
the
conductor
he
had
not
practically
found
the
world
so
unjust
as
the
conductor
implied
but
he
could
not
controvert
his
argument
he
only
said
may
be
the
right
thing
makes
us
feel
good
in
some
way
we
do
know
well
i
do
want
to
feel
good
in
some
way
i
do
know
of
myself
said
the
conductor
very
scornfully
no
that
so
lemuel
admitted
he
remained
silent
with
a
vague
wonder
flitting
through
his
mind
whether
sewell
could
make
anything
better
of
the
case
and
then
settled
back
to
his
thoughts
of
statira
pierced
and
confused
as
they
were
now
with
his
pain
from
that
trouble
with
miss
vane
what
was
that
you
asked
me
just
now
said
the
conductor
that
i
asked
you
lemuel
echoed
oh
yes
i
asked
you
how
you
got
your
place
on
the
well
sir
you
have
to
have
recommendations
they
wo
touch
you
without
and
then
you
have
to
have
about
dollars
capital
to
start
with
you
got
to
get
your
coat
and
your
cap
and
your
badge
and
you
got
to
have
about
twenty
dollars
of
your
own
to
make
change
with
first
off
company
do
start
you
with
a
lemuel
made
no
reply
after
a
while
he
asked
do
you
know
any
good
hotel
around
here
where
i
could
go
for
the
night
well
there
the
brunswick
and
there
the
said
the
conductor
they
both
pretty
fair
lemuel
looked
round
at
the
mention
of
the
aristocratic
hostelries
to
see
if
the
conductor
was
joking
he
owned
to
something
of
the
kind
by
adding
there
a
little
hotel
if
you
want
something
quieter
that
ai
a
great
ways
from
he
gave
the
name
of
the
hotel
and
told
lemuel
how
to
find
it
thank
you
said
lemuel
i
guess
i
get
off
here
then
well
good
guess
i
have
to
get
another
nickel
from
you
said
the
conductor
snapping
his
bell
new
trip
he
explained
oh
said
lemuel
paying
it
seemed
to
him
a
short
ride
for
five
cents
he
got
off
and
as
the
conductor
started
up
the
car
he
called
forward
through
it
to
the
driver
wanted
to
try
for
conductor
i
guess
but
i
guess
the
dollars
capital
settled
that
little
point
for
lemuel
heard
the
voice
but
not
the
words
he
felt
his
bag
heavy
in
his
hand
as
he
walked
away
in
the
direction
the
conductor
had
given
him
and
he
did
not
set
it
down
when
he
stood
hesitating
in
front
of
the
hotel
it
looked
like
too
expensive
a
place
for
him
with
its
door
and
its
bulk
hoisted
high
into
the
air
he
walked
by
the
hotel
and
then
he
came
back
to
it
and
mustered
courage
to
go
in
his
bag
if
not
superb
looked
a
great
deal
more
like
baggage
than
the
lank
sack
which
he
had
come
to
boston
with
he
had
bought
it
only
a
few
days
before
in
hopes
of
going
home
before
long
he
set
it
down
with
some
confidence
on
the
tesselated
floor
of
cheap
marble
and
when
a
young
man
came
out
of
a
little
room
or
booth
near
the
door
where
there
was
a
desk
and
a
row
of
bells
and
a
board
with
keys
hanging
from
the
wall
above
it
lemuel
said
quite
boldly
that
he
would
like
a
room
the
man
said
well
they
did
not
much
expect
transients
it
was
more
of
a
like
but
he
guessed
they
had
a
vacancy
and
they
could
put
him
up
he
brushed
his
shirt
sleeves
down
with
his
hands
and
looked
apologetically
at
some
ashes
on
his
trousers
and
said
well
it
was
not
much
use
trying
to
put
on
style
anyway
when
you
were
taking
care
of
a
furnace
and
had
to
run
the
elevator
yourself
and
look
after
the
whole
concern
he
said
his
aunt
mostly
looked
after
letting
the
rooms
but
she
was
at
church
and
he
guessed
he
should
have
to
see
about
it
himself
he
bade
lemuel
just
get
right
into
the
elevator
and
he
put
his
bag
into
a
cage
that
hung
in
one
corner
of
the
hallway
and
pulled
at
the
wire
rope
and
they
mounted
together
on
the
way
up
he
had
time
to
explain
that
the
clerk
who
usually
ran
the
elevator
when
they
had
no
had
kicked
and
they
were
just
between
hay
and
grass
as
you
might
say
he
showed
lemuel
into
a
grandiose
parlour
or
enormously
draped
and
upholstered
and
furnished
in
a
composite
application
of
yellow
jute
and
red
plush
to
the
ashen
and
sofa
a
in
the
figure
of
a
chiffonier
attempted
to
occupy
the
whole
side
of
the
wall
and
failed
i
afraid
it
more
than
i
can
pay
said
lemuel
i
guess
i
better
see
some
other
but
the
man
said
the
room
belonged
to
a
boarder
that
had
just
gone
and
he
guessed
they
would
not
charge
him
very
much
for
it
he
guessed
lemuel
had
better
stay
he
pulled
the
bed
down
and
showed
him
how
it
worked
and
he
lighted
two
bulbous
contrived
to
burn
the
gas
at
such
a
low
pressure
that
they
were
like
two
unsnuffed
candles
for
brilliancy
he
backed
round
over
the
spacious
floor
and
looked
about
him
with
an
unfamiliar
marauding
air
which
had
a
certain
boldness
but
failed
to
impart
courage
to
lemuel
who
trembled
for
fear
of
the
unknown
expense
but
he
was
ashamed
to
go
away
and
when
the
man
left
him
he
went
to
bed
after
some
suspicious
investigation
of
the
machine
he
was
to
sleep
in
he
found
its
comfort
unmistakable
he
was
tired
out
with
what
had
been
happening
and
the
events
of
the
day
recurred
in
a
turmoil
that
helped
rather
than
hindered
slumber
none
evolved
itself
distinctly
enough
from
the
mass
to
pursue
him
what
he
was
mainly
aware
of
was
the
daring
question
whether
he
could
not
get
the
place
of
that
clerk
who
had
kicked
in
the
morning
he
saw
the
landlady
who
was
called
harmon
and
who
took
the
pay
for
his
lodging
and
said
he
might
leave
his
bag
a
while
there
in
the
office
she
was
a
large
smooth
tranquil
person
who
seemed
ready
for
any
sort
of
consent
she
entered
into
an
easy
conversation
with
lemuel
and
was
so
sympathetic
in
regard
to
the
difficulties
of
getting
along
in
the
city
that
he
had
proposed
himself
as
clerk
and
been
accepted
almost
before
he
believed
the
thing
had
happened
he
was
getting
a
little
used
to
the
rapidity
of
urban
transactions
but
his
mind
had
still
a
rustic
difficulty
in
keeping
up
with
his
experiences
i
suppose
said
harmon
it
ai
very
usual
to
take
anybody
without
a
reference
i
never
do
it
but
so
long
as
you
have
been
a
great
while
in
the
city
you
ever
had
a
place
in
boston
before
well
not
exactly
what
you
may
call
a
place
said
lemuel
with
a
conscience
against
describing
in
that
way
his
position
at
miss
vane
it
was
only
part
he
added
i
was
there
but
a
little
know
anybody
in
the
city
yes
said
lemuel
reluctantly
i
know
rev
david
sewell
oh
all
right
said
harmon
with
eager
satisfaction
i
have
to
be
pretty
particular
who
i
have
in
the
house
the
boarders
are
all
and
i
have
to
have
all
the
departments
accordingly
see
sewell
about
you
as
soon
as
i
get
time
and
i
guess
you
can
take
right
hold
now
if
you
want
harmon
showed
him
in
half
a
minute
how
to
manage
the
elevator
and
then
left
him
with
general
instructions
to
tell
everybody
who
came
upon
any
errand
he
did
not
understand
that
she
would
be
back
in
a
very
short
time
he
found
pen
and
paper
in
the
office
and
she
said
he
might
write
the
letter
that
he
asked
leave
to
send
his
mother
when
he
mentioned
his
mother
she
said
yes
indeed
with
a
burst
of
maternal
sympathy
which
was
imagined
in
her
case
for
she
had
already
told
lemuel
that
if
she
had
ever
had
any
children
she
would
not
have
gone
into
the
hotel
business
which
she
believed
unfriendly
to
their
right
nurture
she
said
she
never
liked
to
take
ladies
with
children
he
enclosed
some
money
to
his
mother
which
he
had
intended
to
send
but
which
before
the
occurrence
of
the
good
fortune
that
now
seemed
opening
upon
him
he
thought
he
must
withhold
he
made
as
little
as
he
could
of
his
parting
with
miss
vane
whom
he
had
celebrated
in
earlier
letters
to
his
mother
he
did
not
wish
to
afflict
her
on
his
own
account
or
incense
her
against
miss
vane
who
he
felt
could
not
help
her
part
in
it
but
his
heart
burned
anew
against
miss
sibyl
while
he
wrote
he
dwelt
upon
his
good
luck
in
getting
this
new
position
at
once
and
he
let
his
mother
see
that
he
considered
it
a
rise
in
life
he
said
he
was
going
to
try
to
get
harmon
to
let
him
go
home
for
thanksgiving
though
he
presumed
he
might
have
to
come
back
the
same
night
his
letter
was
short
but
he
was
several
times
interrupted
by
the
lady
boarders
many
of
whom
stopped
to
ask
harmon
something
on
their
way
to
their
rooms
from
breakfast
they
did
not
really
want
anything
in
most
cases
but
they
were
strict
with
lemuel
in
wanting
to
know
just
when
they
could
see
harmon
and
they
delayed
somewhat
to
satisfy
a
natural
curiosity
in
regard
to
him
they
made
talk
with
him
as
he
took
them
up
in
the
elevator
and
did
what
they
could
to
find
out
about
him
most
of
them
had
their
in
their
hands
and
dangled
them
by
the
triangular
pieces
of
brass
which
the
keys
were
chained
to
they
affected
some
sort
of
breakfast
costume
and
lemuel
thought
them
very
fashionable
they
nearly
all
snuffled
and
whined
as
they
spoke
some
had
a
soft
lazy
nasal
others
broke
abruptly
from
silence
to
silence
in
voices
of
nervous
sharpness
like
the
cry
or
the
bleat
of
an
animal
one
young
girl
who
was
quite
pretty
had
a
high
hoarse
voice
like
a
gander
lemuel
did
not
mind
all
this
he
talked
through
his
nose
too
and
he
accepted
harmon
smooth
characterisation
of
her
guests
as
she
called
them
which
she
delivered
in
a
slow
unimpassioned
voice
i
never
have
any
but
the
highest
class
people
in
my
house
the
very
nicest
and
i
never
have
any
jangling
going
on
in
the
first
place
i
never
allow
anybody
to
have
anything
to
complain
of
and
then
if
they
do
complain
i
right
up
and
down
with
them
i
tell
them
their
rooms
are
wanted
and
they
understand
what
i
mean
and
i
never
allow
any
trouble
among
the
servants
i
tell
them
if
they
are
not
suited
that
i
want
them
to
stay
and
if
they
get
to
quarrelling
among
themselves
i
send
them
all
away
and
get
a
new
lot
i
pay
the
highest
wages
and
i
can
always
do
it
if
you
want
to
keep
up
with
the
times
at
all
you
have
got
to
set
a
good
table
and
i
mean
to
set
just
as
good
a
table
as
any
in
boston
i
do
intend
to
let
any
one
complain
of
my
house
on
that
score
well
it
as
broad
as
it
long
if
you
set
a
good
table
you
can
ask
a
good
price
and
if
you
do
you
ca
that
all
pay
as
you
go
is
my
harmon
sat
talking
in
the
little
den
beside
the
door
which
she
called
the
office
when
she
returned
from
that
absence
which
she
had
asked
him
to
say
would
not
be
more
than
fifteen
minutes
at
the
outside
it
had
been
something
more
than
two
hours
and
it
had
ended
almost
clandestinely
but
knowledge
of
her
return
had
somehow
spread
through
the
house
and
several
ladies
came
in
while
she
was
talking
to
ask
when
their
were
to
be
put
up
or
to
say
that
they
knew
their
must
be
out
of
order
or
that
there
were
mice
in
their
closets
for
they
had
heard
them
gnawing
or
that
they
were
sure
their
smelt
and
that
the
traps
were
not
working
harmon
was
prompt
in
every
exigency
she
showed
the
greatest
surprise
that
those
shades
had
not
gone
up
yet
she
said
she
was
going
to
send
round
for
the
gasfitter
to
look
at
the
fixtures
all
over
the
house
and
that
she
would
get
some
potash
to
pour
down
the
bowls
for
she
knew
the
drainage
was
perfect
it
was
just
the
pipes
down
the
traps
that
smelt
she
advised
a
cat
for
the
mice
and
said
she
would
get
one
she
used
the
greatest
sympathy
with
the
ladies
recognising
a
real
sufferer
in
each
and
not
attempting
to
deny
anything
from
the
came
at
times
the
sound
of
voices
which
blended
in
a
discord
loud
above
the
clatter
of
crockery
but
harmon
seemed
not
to
hear
them
an
excited
foreigner
of
some
sort
finally
rushed
from
this
quarter
and
thrust
his
head
into
the
booth
where
lemuel
and
harmon
sat
long
enough
to
explode
some
formula
of
renunciation
upon
her
which
left
her
serenity
unruffled
she
received
with
the
same
patience
the
sarcasm
of
a
boarder
who
appeared
at
the
with
a
bag
in
his
hand
and
said
he
would
send
an
for
his
trunk
he
threw
down
the
money
for
his
receipted
bill
and
when
she
said
she
was
sorry
he
was
going
he
replied
that
he
could
not
stand
the
table
any
longer
and
that
he
believed
that
french
cook
of
hers
had
died
on
the
way
over
he
was
tired
of
the
nova
scotia
temporary
who
had
become
permanent
a
gentleman
waited
for
the
parting
guest
to
be
gone
and
then
said
to
the
tranquil
harmon
so
mellen
has
kicked
has
he
yes
evans
said
harmon
mr
mellen
has
and
do
you
want
to
abuse
him
a
little
you
can
to
me
you
know
suggested
the
gentleman
he
had
a
full
beard
parted
at
the
chin
it
was
almost
white
and
looked
older
than
the
rest
of
his
face
his
eyes
were
at
once
sad
and
whimsical
lemuel
tried
to
think
where
he
had
seen
him
before
thank
you
i
do
know
as
it
would
do
any
good
evans
but
if
he
could
have
waited
one
week
longer
i
should
have
had
that
yes
that
is
what
i
firmly
believe
do
you
feel
too
much
broken
up
to
accept
a
ticket
to
the
wednesday
matinée
at
the
museum
no
i
do
said
harmon
but
i
should
want
to
deprive
evans
of
oh
she
would
go
said
evans
with
a
slight
sigh
you
had
better
take
it
jefferson
going
to
do
is
that
so
asked
harmon
placidly
taking
the
ticket
well
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
evans
evans
barker
our
new
clerk
she
said
introducing
them
lemuel
rose
with
rustic
awkwardness
and
shook
hands
with
evans
who
looked
at
him
with
a
friendly
smile
but
said
nothing
now
barker
is
here
i
guess
i
can
get
the
evans
said
well
he
was
glad
she
could
and
went
out
of
the
street
door
he
just
one
of
the
nicest
gentlemen
i
got
continued
harmon
following
him
with
her
eye
as
far
as
she
conveniently
could
without
turning
her
head
him
and
his
wife
both
ever
heard
of
the
i
do
know
as
i
have
said
lemuel
well
he
one
of
the
editors
it
a
kind
of
a
sunday
paper
i
guess
for
all
it
do
come
out
that
day
i
presume
he
could
go
every
night
in
the
week
to
every
theatre
in
town
if
he
wanted
to
i
do
know
how
many
tickets
he
give
me
some
of
the
ladies
seem
to
think
he
always
makin
fun
of
them
but
i
ca
ever
feel
that
way
he
used
to
board
with
a
great
friend
of
mine
him
and
his
wife
they
been
with
me
now
ever
since
hewitt
died
she
was
the
one
they
boarded
with
before
they
say
he
used
to
be
dreadful
easygoing
his
wife
was
all
saved
him
but
i
guess
he
different
now
well
i
must
go
out
and
see
after
the
lunch
you
watch
the
office
and
say
just
what
i
told
you
xiv
sewell
chanced
to
open
his
door
to
go
out
just
as
miss
vane
put
her
hand
on
the
the
morning
after
she
had
dismissed
lemuel
the
cheer
of
his
monday
face
died
out
at
the
unsmiling
severity
of
hers
but
he
contrived
to
ask
her
in
and
said
he
would
call
sewell
if
she
would
sit
down
in
the
a
moment
i
do
know
she
said
with
a
certain
look
of
inquiry
not
unmixed
with
compassion
it
about
the
minister
fetched
a
deep
sigh
yes
i
know
it
but
she
will
have
to
know
it
sooner
or
he
went
to
the
stairway
and
called
her
name
and
then
returned
to
miss
vane
in
the
has
lemuel
been
here
she
asked
you
said
you
knew
it
was
about
him
it
was
my
bad
conscience
i
suppose
and
your
face
that
told
miss
vane
waited
for
sewell
presence
before
she
unpacked
her
heart
then
she
left
nothing
in
it
she
ended
by
saying
i
have
examined
and
sibyl
but
it
like
a
chameleon
she
changed
colour
with
every
new
light
she
was
put
here
miss
vane
had
got
sorrowfully
back
to
something
more
of
her
wonted
humour
and
laughed
poor
sibyl
said
sewell
poor
retorted
miss
vane
not
at
all
i
could
get
nothing
out
of
either
of
them
but
i
feel
perfectly
sure
that
lemuel
was
not
to
it
very
possible
suggested
sewell
that
he
did
say
something
in
his
awkward
way
that
she
misconstrued
into
miss
vane
did
not
seem
to
believe
this
if
lemuel
had
given
me
the
slightest
satisfaction
she
began
in
but
no
she
broke
off
it
had
to
be
she
rose
i
thought
i
had
better
come
and
tell
you
at
once
sewell
i
suppose
you
will
want
to
look
him
up
and
do
something
more
for
him
i
wish
if
you
find
him
you
would
make
him
take
this
she
gave
the
minister
a
bill
i
tried
to
do
so
but
he
would
not
have
it
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
without
him
he
is
the
best
and
most
faithful
creature
in
the
world
even
in
this
little
time
i
had
got
to
relying
implicitly
upon
his
sense
his
judgment
his
goodness
his
well
good
morning
she
ran
out
of
the
door
and
left
sewell
confronted
with
his
wife
he
did
not
know
whether
she
had
left
him
to
hope
or
to
despair
and
he
waited
for
his
wife
to
interpret
his
emotion
but
sewell
tacitly
refused
to
do
this
after
a
dreary
interval
he
plucked
a
random
cheerfulness
out
of
space
and
said
well
if
miss
vane
feels
in
that
way
about
it
i
do
see
why
the
whole
affair
ca
be
arranged
and
barker
david
returned
his
wife
not
vehemently
at
all
when
you
come
out
with
those
mannish
ideas
i
do
know
what
to
well
my
dear
said
the
minister
i
should
be
glad
to
come
out
with
some
womanish
ideas
if
i
had
them
i
dare
say
they
would
be
better
but
i
do
my
poor
best
under
the
circumstances
what
is
the
trouble
with
my
ideas
except
that
the
sex
is
wrong
you
think
you
men
replied
sewell
that
a
thing
like
that
can
be
mended
up
and
smoothed
over
and
made
just
the
same
as
ever
you
think
that
because
miss
vane
is
sorry
she
sent
barker
away
and
wants
him
back
she
can
take
him
i
do
see
why
she
ca
i
sometimes
supposed
that
the
very
highest
purpose
of
christianity
was
mutual
forgiveness
forbearance
with
one
another
that
all
very
well
said
sewell
but
you
know
that
whenever
i
have
taken
a
cook
back
after
she
had
shown
temper
it
been
an
entire
failure
and
this
is
a
far
worse
case
because
there
is
disappointed
mixed
up
with
it
i
do
suppose
barker
is
at
all
to
blame
whatever
has
happened
you
may
be
perfectly
sure
that
it
has
been
partly
a
bit
of
in
sibyl
and
partly
a
mischievous
desire
to
use
her
power
over
him
i
foresaw
that
she
would
soon
be
tired
of
reforming
him
but
whatever
it
is
it
something
that
you
ca
repair
suppose
barker
went
back
to
them
could
they
ignore
what
happened
of
course
not
sewell
admitted
well
and
should
he
ask
her
pardon
or
she
his
the
socratic
method
is
irresistible
said
the
minister
sadly
you
have
proved
that
nothing
can
be
done
for
barker
with
the
vanes
and
now
the
question
is
what
be
done
for
him
that
something
i
must
leave
to
you
david
said
his
wife
dispiritedly
she
arose
and
as
she
passed
out
of
the
room
she
added
you
will
have
to
find
him
in
the
place
and
you
had
better
go
round
to
the
police
stations
and
the
tramps
and
begin
sewell
sighed
heavily
under
the
sarcastic
advice
but
acted
upon
it
and
set
forth
upon
the
useless
quest
because
he
did
not
know
in
the
least
what
else
to
do
all
that
week
barker
lay
a
lurking
discomfort
in
his
soul
though
as
the
days
passed
the
burden
grew
undeniably
lighter
sewell
had
a
great
many
things
besides
barker
to
think
of
but
when
sunday
came
and
he
rose
in
his
pulpit
he
could
not
help
casting
a
glance
of
guilty
fear
toward
miss
vane
pew
and
drawing
a
long
breath
of
guilty
relief
not
to
see
lemuel
in
it
we
are
so
made
that
in
the
reaction
the
minister
was
able
to
throw
himself
into
the
matter
of
his
discourse
with
uncommon
fervour
it
was
really
very
good
matter
and
he
felt
the
literary
joy
in
it
which
flatters
the
author
even
of
a
happily
worded
supplication
to
the
deity
he
let
his
eyes
freed
from
their
bondage
to
attentive
face
roam
at
large
in
liberal
ease
over
his
whole
congregation
and
when
toward
the
close
of
his
sermon
one
visage
began
to
grow
out
upon
him
from
the
two
or
three
hundred
others
and
to
concentrate
in
itself
the
facial
expression
of
all
the
rest
and
become
the
only
countenance
there
it
was
a
perceptible
moment
before
he
identified
it
as
that
of
his
inalienable
charge
then
he
began
to
preach
at
it
as
usual
but
defiantly
and
with
yet
a
haste
to
be
through
and
to
get
speech
with
it
that
he
felt
was
ludicrous
and
must
appear
unaccountable
to
his
hearers
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
not
bring
his
sermon
to
a
close
he
ended
it
in
a
cloudy
burst
of
rhetoric
which
he
feared
would
please
the
nervous
elderly
ladies
who
sometimes
blamed
him
for
a
want
of
emotionality
and
knew
must
grieve
the
judicious
while
the
choir
was
singing
the
closing
hymn
he
contrived
to
beckon
the
sexton
to
the
pulpit
and
described
and
located
lemuel
to
him
as
well
as
he
could
without
actually
pointing
him
out
he
said
that
he
wished
to
see
that
young
man
after
church
and
asked
the
sexton
to
bring
him
to
his
room
the
sexton
did
so
to
the
best
of
his
ability
but
the
young
man
whom
he
brought
was
not
lemuel
and
had
to
be
got
rid
of
with
apologies
on
three
or
four
successive
sundays
lemuel
face
dawned
upon
the
minister
from
the
congregation
and
tasked
his
powers
of
impersonal
appeal
and
mental
concentration
to
the
utmost
it
never
appeared
twice
in
the
same
place
and
when
at
last
sewell
had
tutored
the
sexton
carefully
in
lemuel
dress
he
was
driven
to
despair
one
morning
when
he
saw
the
boy
sliding
along
between
the
seats
in
the
gallery
and
sitting
down
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
in
an
entirely
new
suit
of
clothes
after
this
defeat
the
sexton
said
with
humorous
sympathy
well
there
ai
anything
for
it
now
sewell
but
a
detective
or
else
an
advertisement
in
the
sewell
laughed
with
him
at
his
joke
and
took
what
comfort
he
could
from
the
evidence
of
prosperity
which
lemuel
new
clothes
offered
he
argued
that
if
barker
could
afford
to
buy
them
he
could
not
be
in
immediate
need
and
for
some
final
encounter
with
him
he
trusted
in
providence
and
was
not
too
much
cast
down
when
his
wife
made
him
recognise
that
he
was
trusting
in
luck
it
was
an
ordeal
to
look
forward
to
finding
lemuel
sooner
or
later
among
his
hearers
every
sunday
but
having
prepared
his
nerves
for
the
shock
as
men
adjust
their
sensibilities
to
the
recurrent
pain
of
a
disease
he
came
to
bear
it
with
fortitude
especially
as
he
continually
reminded
himself
that
he
had
his
fixed
purpose
to
get
at
lemuel
at
last
and
befriend
him
in
any
and
every
possible
way
he
tried
hard
to
keep
from
getting
a
grudge
against
him
at
the
hotel
lemuel
remained
in
much
of
his
original
belief
in
the
fashion
and
social
grandeur
of
the
ladies
who
formed
the
majority
of
harmon
guests
our
womankind
are
prone
to
a
sort
of
helpless
intimacy
with
those
who
serve
them
the
ladies
had
an
instinctive
perception
of
lemuel
trustiness
and
readily
gave
him
their
confidence
and
much
of
their
history
he
came
to
know
them
without
being
at
all
able
to
classify
them
with
reference
to
society
at
large
as
of
that
large
tribe
among
us
who
have
revolted
from
domestic
care
and
have
skilfully
unseated
the
black
rider
who
remains
mounted
behind
the
husband
of
the
average
some
of
them
had
never
kept
house
being
young
and
newly
married
though
of
this
sort
there
were
those
who
had
tried
it
in
flats
and
had
reverted
to
their
natural
condition
of
boarding
they
advised
lemuel
not
to
take
a
flat
whatever
he
did
unless
he
wanted
to
perish
at
once
other
lady
boarders
had
broken
up
housekeeping
during
the
first
years
of
the
war
and
had
been
boarding
round
ever
since
going
from
hotels
in
the
city
to
hotels
in
the
country
and
back
again
with
the
change
of
the
seasons
these
mostly
had
husbands
who
had
horses
and
they
talked
with
equal
tenderness
of
the
husbands
and
the
horses
so
that
you
could
not
always
tell
which
jim
or
bob
was
usually
they
had
no
children
but
occasionally
they
had
a
married
daughter
or
a
son
who
lived
west
there
were
several
single
ladies
one
who
seemed
to
have
nothing
in
this
world
to
do
but
to
come
down
to
her
meals
and
another
a
physician
who
had
not
been
able
in
embracing
the
medical
profession
to
deny
herself
the
girlish
pleasure
of
her
pet
name
and
was
lettered
in
the
list
of
guests
in
the
entry
as
cissie
bluff
in
the
attic
which
had
a
favourable
to
their
work
were
two
girls
who
were
studying
art
at
the
museum
one
of
them
looked
delicate
at
first
sight
and
afterwards
seemed
merely
very
gentle
with
a
pallor
which
was
not
unhealth
a
student
in
the
law
school
sat
at
the
table
with
these
girls
and
seemed
sometimes
to
go
with
them
to
concerts
and
lectures
from
his
talk
which
was
almost
the
only
talk
that
made
itself
heard
in
the
it
appeared
that
he
was
from
wyoming
territory
he
treated
the
young
ladies
as
representative
of
boston
and
its
prejudices
though
apparently
they
were
not
bostonians
there
were
several
serious
and
retiring
couples
of
whom
one
or
other
was
an
invalid
and
several
who
were
poor
and
preferred
the
plated
gentility
of
harmon
hotel
it
was
called
the
albans
harmon
liked
the
name
to
the
genuine
poverty
of
such
housekeeping
as
they
could
have
set
up
about
each
of
these
women
a
home
might
have
clung
with
all
its
loves
and
cares
they
were
naturally
like
other
women
but
here
they
were
ignoble
particles
without
attraction
for
one
another
or
apparently
joy
for
themselves
impermanent
idle
listless
they
had
got
rid
of
the
trouble
of
housekeeping
and
of
its
dignity
and
usefulness
there
were
a
few
children
in
the
house
not
at
all
noisy
the
boys
played
on
the
sidewalk
and
the
little
girls
stayed
in
their
rooms
with
their
mothers
and
rarely
took
the
air
oftener
than
they
they
came
down
rather
later
to
breakfast
and
they
seemed
not
to
go
to
school
some
of
them
had
piano
lessons
in
their
rooms
their
mothers
did
not
go
out
much
sometimes
they
went
to
church
or
the
theatre
and
they
went
shopping
but
they
had
apparently
no
more
social
than
domestic
life
now
and
then
they
had
a
friend
to
lunch
or
dinner
if
a
lady
was
absent
it
was
known
to
harmon
and
through
her
to
the
other
ladies
that
she
was
spending
the
day
with
a
friend
of
hers
at
an
hotel
in
newton
or
lexington
or
woburn
in
a
city
full
of
receptions
of
and
harmon
guests
led
the
lives
of
cloistered
nuns
so
far
as
such
pleasures
were
concerned
occasionally
a
transient
had
rooms
for
a
week
or
two
and
was
continually
going
and
receiving
visits
she
became
the
object
of
a
certain
unenvious
curiosity
with
the
other
ladies
who
had
not
much
sociability
among
themselves
they
waited
a
good
while
before
paying
visits
at
one
another
rooms
and
then
were
very
punctilious
not
to
go
again
until
their
calls
had
been
returned
they
were
all
doctoring
themselves
they
did
not
talk
gossip
or
scandal
much
they
talked
of
their
diseases
and
physicians
and
their
married
daughters
and
of
harmon
whom
they
censured
for
being
too
easygoing
certain
of
them
devoured
novels
which
they
carried
about
clasped
to
their
breasts
with
their
fingers
in
them
at
the
place
where
they
were
reading
they
did
not
often
speak
of
them
and
apparently
took
them
as
people
take
opium
the
men
were
the
husbands
or
fathers
of
the
women
and
were
wholly
without
the
domestic
weight
or
consequence
that
belongs
to
men
living
in
their
own
houses
there
were
certain
old
bachelors
among
whom
were
two
or
three
decayed
branches
of
good
boston
families
spendthrifts
or
invalided
bankrupts
evans
was
practically
among
the
single
gentlemen
for
his
wife
never
appeared
in
the
parlour
or
and
was
seen
only
when
she
went
in
or
out
heavily
veiled
for
a
walk
lemuel
heard
very
soon
that
she
had
suffered
a
shock
from
the
death
of
her
son
on
the
cars
the
other
ladies
made
much
of
her
inability
to
get
over
it
and
said
nothing
would
induce
them
to
have
a
son
of
theirs
go
in
and
out
on
the
cars
among
these
people
such
as
they
were
and
far
as
they
might
be
from
a
final
civilisation
lemuel
began
to
feel
an
ambition
to
move
more
lightly
and
quickly
than
he
had
yet
known
how
to
do
to
speak
promptly
and
to
appear
well
our
schooling
does
not
train
us
to
graceful
or
even
correct
speech
even
our
colleges
often
leave
that
uncouth
many
of
harmon
boarders
spoke
bad
grammar
through
their
noses
but
the
ladies
dressed
stylishly
and
the
men
were
good
arithmeticians
lemuel
obeyed
a
native
impulse
rather
than
a
good
example
in
cultivating
a
better
address
but
the
incentive
to
thrift
and
fashion
was
all
about
him
he
had
not
been
ignorant
that
his
clothes
were
queer
in
cut
and
out
of
date
and
during
his
stay
at
miss
vane
he
had
taken
much
council
with
himself
as
to
whether
he
ought
not
to
get
a
new
suit
with
his
first
money
instead
of
sending
it
home
now
he
had
solved
the
question
after
sending
the
money
home
by
the
discovery
of
a
place
on
a
degenerate
street
in
a
neighbourhood
of
chinese
laundries
with
the
polite
name
of
misfit
parlours
where
they
professed
to
sell
the
failures
of
the
leading
tailors
of
boston
new
york
and
chicago
after
long
study
of
the
window
of
the
parlours
lemuel
ventured
within
one
day
and
was
told
when
he
said
he
could
not
afford
the
suit
he
fancied
that
he
might
pay
for
it
on
the
instalment
plan
which
the
proprietor
explained
to
him
in
the
mirror
he
was
almost
startled
at
the
stylishness
of
his
own
image
the
proprietor
of
the
parlours
complimented
him
you
see
you
got
a
good
figure
for
a
suit
of
clothes
what
i
call
a
ready
made
figure
can
go
into
a
clothing
store
anywheres
and
fit
he
took
the
first
instalment
of
the
price
with
lemuel
name
and
address
and
said
he
would
send
the
clothes
round
but
in
the
evening
he
brought
them
himself
and
no
doubt
verified
lemuel
statement
by
this
device
it
was
a
saturday
night
and
the
next
morning
lemuel
rose
early
to
put
them
on
he
meant
to
go
to
church
in
them
and
in
the
afternoon
he
did
not
know
just
what
he
should
do
he
had
hoped
that
some
chance
might
bring
them
together
again
and
then
he
could
see
from
the
way
miss
dudley
and
grier
behaved
just
what
they
thought
he
had
many
minds
about
the
matter
himself
and
had
gone
from
an
extreme
of
to
one
of
and
between
these
he
had
halted
at
every
gradation
of
blame
and
exculpation
but
perhaps
what
chiefly
kept
him
away
was
the
uncertainty
of
his
future
till
he
could
give
some
shape
to
that
he
had
no
courage
to
face
the
past
sometimes
he
wished
never
to
see
either
of
those
girls
again
but
at
other
times
he
had
a
longing
to
go
and
explain
to
justify
himself
or
to
give
himself
up
to
justice
the
new
clothes
gave
him
more
heart
than
he
had
yet
had
but
the
most
he
could
bring
himself
to
do
was
to
walk
towards
pleasant
avenue
the
next
sunday
afternoon
which
harmon
especially
gave
him
and
to
think
about
walking
up
and
down
before
the
house
it
ended
in
his
walking
up
and
down
the
block
first
on
one
side
of
the
street
and
then
on
the
other
he
knew
the
girls
window
miss
dudley
had
shown
him
it
was
the
middle
window
of
the
top
story
when
they
were
looking
out
of
it
and
he
glanced
up
at
it
then
he
hurried
away
but
he
could
not
leave
the
street
without
stopping
at
the
corner
to
cast
a
last
look
back
at
the
house
there
was
an
apothecary
at
that
corner
and
while
he
stood
wistfully
staring
and
going
round
the
corner
a
little
way
and
coming
back
to
look
at
the
things
in
the
apothecary
window
he
saw
grier
come
swiftly
towards
him
he
wanted
to
run
away
now
but
he
could
not
he
felt
nailed
to
the
spot
and
he
felt
the
colour
go
out
of
his
face
she
pretended
not
to
see
him
at
first
but
with
a
second
glance
she
abandoned
the
pretence
and
at
his
saying
faintly
good
afternoon
she
said
with
freezing
surprise
oh
good
afternoon
barker
and
passed
into
the
apothecary
he
could
not
go
now
since
he
had
spoken
and
leave
all
so
inconclusive
again
and
yet
grier
had
been
so
repellent
so
cutting
in
her
tone
and
manner
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
face
her
another
time
when
she
came
out
he
faltered
i
hope
there
is
anybody
sick
at
your
house
miss
oh
nobody
that
you
care
about
barker
she
answered
airily
and
began
to
tilt
rapidly
away
with
her
chin
thrust
out
before
her
he
made
a
few
paces
after
her
and
then
stopped
she
seemed
to
stop
too
and
he
caught
up
with
her
i
hope
he
gasped
there
ai
anything
the
matter
with
miss
dudley
oh
nothing
care
about
said
grier
and
she
added
with
terrible
irony
you
round
to
inquire
so
much
that
you
hai
allowed
time
for
any
has
she
been
sick
long
faltered
lemuel
i
did
dare
to
come
he
cried
out
i
been
wanting
to
come
but
i
did
suppose
you
would
speak
to
me
any
of
now
his
tongue
was
unlocked
he
ran
on
i
do
know
as
it
any
excuse
there
any
excuse
for
such
a
thing
i
know
she
must
perfectly
despise
me
and
that
i
not
fit
for
her
to
look
at
but
i
give
anything
if
i
could
take
it
all
back
and
be
just
where
i
was
before
you
tell
her
wo
you
how
i
feel
grier
who
had
listened
with
a
killingly
averted
face
turned
sharply
upon
him
you
mean
about
stayin
away
so
long
i
do
know
as
she
cared
a
great
deal
but
it
a
pretty
queer
way
of
showin
you
cared
for
i
did
mean
that
retorted
lemuel
and
he
added
by
an
immense
effort
i
meant
the
way
i
behaved
when
i
was
there
i
meant
oh
said
grier
turning
her
face
away
again
she
turned
it
so
far
away
that
the
back
of
her
head
was
all
that
lemuel
could
see
i
guess
you
better
speak
to
statira
about
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
door
of
the
and
grier
let
herself
in
with
her
wo
you
walk
in
barker
she
said
in
formal
tones
of
invitation
is
she
well
enough
to
see
company
murmured
lemuel
i
should
want
to
disturb
i
do
believe
but
what
she
can
see
you
said
grier
for
the
first
time
relentingly
all
right
said
lemuel
gulping
the
lump
in
his
throat
and
he
followed
grier
up
the
flights
of
stairs
to
the
door
of
the
room
which
she
flung
open
without
knocking
she
said
here
barker
and
lemuel
from
the
dark
landing
where
he
lurked
a
moment
could
see
statira
sitting
in
the
in
a
pretty
blue
after
a
first
flush
she
looked
pale
and
now
and
then
put
up
her
hand
to
hide
a
hoarse
little
cough
xv
walk
right
in
barker
cried
grier
and
lemuel
entered
more
awkward
and
sheepish
in
his
new
suit
from
the
misfit
parlours
than
he
had
been
before
in
his
willoughby
pastures
best
clothes
statira
merely
said
why
barker
and
stood
at
her
chair
where
she
rose
you
quite
a
stranger
wo
you
sit
down
lemuel
sat
down
and
grier
said
politely
wo
you
let
me
take
your
hat
barker
and
they
both
treated
him
with
so
much
ceremony
and
deference
that
it
seemed
impossible
he
could
ever
have
done
such
a
monstrous
thing
as
kiss
a
young
lady
like
miss
dudley
and
he
felt
that
he
never
could
approach
the
subject
even
to
accept
a
just
doom
at
her
hands
they
all
talked
about
the
weather
for
a
minute
and
then
grier
said
well
i
guess
i
shall
have
to
go
down
and
set
this
boneset
to
steep
and
as
he
rose
and
stood
to
let
her
pass
she
caught
his
arm
and
gave
it
a
clutch
he
did
not
know
whether
she
did
it
on
purpose
or
why
she
did
it
but
somehow
it
said
to
him
that
she
was
his
friend
and
he
did
not
feel
so
much
afraid
when
she
was
gone
however
he
returned
to
the
weather
for
conversation
but
when
statira
said
it
was
lucky
for
her
that
the
winter
held
off
so
he
made
out
to
inquire
about
her
sickness
and
she
told
him
that
she
had
caught
a
heavy
cold
at
first
it
seemed
just
to
be
a
but
afterwards
it
seemed
to
settle
on
the
lungs
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
never
throw
it
off
they
had
had
the
doctor
twice
but
now
she
was
better
and
the
cough
was
nearly
gone
i
guess
i
took
the
cold
that
day
from
havin
the
window
open
she
concluded
and
she
passed
her
hand
across
her
lap
and
looked
down
demurely
and
then
up
at
the
ceiling
and
her
head
twitched
a
little
and
trembled
lemuel
knew
that
his
hour
had
come
if
ever
it
were
to
come
and
he
said
hoarsely
i
guess
if
i
made
you
take
cold
that
day
it
was
all
i
did
i
guess
i
did
worse
than
she
did
not
look
at
him
and
pretend
ignorance
as
grier
would
have
done
but
lifting
her
moist
eyes
and
then
dropping
them
she
said
why
barker
what
can
you
mean
you
know
what
i
mean
he
retorted
with
courage
astonishing
to
him
it
was
because
i
liked
you
so
he
could
not
say
loved
it
seemed
too
bold
there
nothing
else
can
excuse
it
and
i
do
know
as
she
put
up
her
hands
to
her
eyes
and
began
to
cry
and
he
rose
and
went
to
her
and
said
oh
do
cry
do
cry
and
somehow
he
took
hold
of
her
hands
and
then
her
arms
went
round
his
neck
and
she
was
crying
on
his
breast
you
think
i
rather
of
a
silly
person
crying
so
much
about
nothing
she
said
when
she
lifted
her
head
from
his
shoulder
to
wipe
her
eyes
but
i
ca
seem
to
help
it
and
she
broke
down
again
i
presume
it
because
i
been
sick
and
i
kind
of
weak
yet
i
know
you
would
have
done
that
that
day
if
you
had
have
cared
for
me
and
i
was
mad
a
bit
not
half
as
mad
as
i
ought
to
have
been
but
when
you
stayed
away
so
long
and
never
seemed
to
come
near
any
more
i
did
know
what
think
but
now
i
can
understand
just
how
you
felt
and
i
do
blame
you
one
bit
i
should
have
done
just
so
myself
if
been
a
man
i
suppose
and
now
it
all
come
right
i
do
mind
being
sick
or
anything
only
when
thanksgiving
came
we
felt
sure
you
call
and
we
got
the
pies
nicely
warmed
oh
dear
she
gave
way
again
and
then
pressed
her
cheek
tight
against
his
to
revive
herself
said
she
knew
it
was
just
because
you
was
kind
of
ashamed
and
i
was
too
sick
to
eat
any
of
the
pies
anyway
and
so
it
all
turned
out
for
the
best
and
i
do
want
you
to
believe
that
i
one
to
cry
over
spilt
milk
especially
when
it
all
gathered
up
again
her
happy
tongue
ran
on
revealing
divining
everything
and
he
sat
down
with
her
in
his
arms
hardly
speaking
a
word
till
her
heart
was
quite
poured
out
grier
left
them
a
long
time
together
and
before
she
came
back
he
had
told
statira
all
about
himself
since
their
last
meeting
she
was
very
angry
at
the
way
that
girl
had
behaved
at
miss
vane
but
she
was
glad
he
had
found
such
a
good
place
now
without
being
beholden
to
any
one
for
it
and
she
showed
that
she
felt
a
due
pride
in
his
being
an
hotel
clerk
he
described
the
hotel
and
told
what
he
had
to
do
there
and
about
harmon
and
the
fashionableness
of
all
the
guests
but
he
said
he
did
not
think
any
of
the
ladies
went
ahead
of
her
in
dress
if
they
came
up
to
her
and
statira
pressed
her
lips
gratefully
against
his
cheek
and
then
lifting
her
head
held
herself
a
little
away
to
see
him
again
and
said
splendidly
dressed
i
noticed
it
the
first
thing
when
you
came
in
you
look
just
as
if
you
had
always
lived
in
is
that
so
asked
lemuel
and
he
felt
his
heart
suffused
with
tender
pride
and
joy
he
told
her
of
the
misfit
parlours
and
the
instalment
plan
and
she
said
well
it
was
just
splendid
and
she
asked
him
if
he
knew
she
was
in
the
store
any
more
and
no
she
added
delightedly
upon
his
confession
of
ignorance
i
going
to
work
in
the
after
this
where
grier
works
it
better
pay
and
you
have
more
control
of
your
hours
and
you
can
set
down
while
you
work
if
a
mind
to
i
think
it
going
to
be
splendid
what
should
you
say
if
grier
and
me
took
some
rooms
and
went
to
housekeepin
i
do
know
said
lemuel
but
in
his
soul
he
felt
jealous
of
her
keeping
house
with
grier
well
i
do
know
as
we
shall
do
it
said
statira
as
if
feeling
his
tacit
reluctance
grier
came
in
just
then
and
cast
a
glance
of
friendly
satire
at
them
well
i
declare
she
said
for
all
recognition
of
the
situation
lemuel
made
an
offer
to
rise
but
statira
would
not
let
him
i
guess
grier
wo
mind
it
i
guess
i
can
stand
it
if
you
can
said
grier
and
this
seemed
such
a
witty
speech
that
they
all
laughed
till
as
statira
said
she
thought
she
should
die
they
laughed
the
more
when
grier
added
dryly
i
presume
you
wo
want
your
boneset
she
set
the
vessel
she
had
brought
it
up
in
on
the
stove
and
covered
it
with
a
saucer
i
do
know
as
should
if
i
was
in
your
place
it
kind
o
curious
i
should
bring
remedies
home
with
me
at
at
this
they
all
laughed
a
third
time
till
grier
said
do
you
want
to
raise
the
roof
she
began
to
bustle
about
and
to
set
out
a
little
table
and
cover
it
with
a
napkin
and
as
she
worked
she
talked
on
i
guess
if
you
want
any
boneset
tea
a
little
of
the
other
kind
wo
hurt
any
of
us
and
i
kinder
want
a
cup
she
set
it
to
steep
on
the
stove
and
it
went
through
lemuel
mind
that
she
might
have
steeped
the
boneset
there
too
if
she
had
thought
of
it
but
he
did
not
say
anything
though
it
seemed
a
pretty
good
joke
on
grier
she
ran
on
in
that
way
of
hers
so
that
you
never
could
tell
whether
she
really
meant
a
thing
or
not
i
guess
if
i
have
to
manage
many
more
cases
like
yours
dudley
i
shall
want
to
lay
in
a
whole
chest
of
it
what
do
you
think
barker
barker
repeated
statira
well
i
afraid
to
say
lemuel
any
more
for
fear
he
fly
off
the
handle
and
never
come
again
what
do
you
think
barker
of
to
set
at
that
window
every
sunday
for
the
last
three
weeks
and
keep
watch
of
both
sidewalks
till
you
get
such
a
crick
in
your
neck
and
your
eyes
so
set
in
your
head
you
could
move
either
of
now
grier
said
statira
from
lemuel
shoulder
well
i
do
say
i
had
to
do
it
and
i
do
say
who
the
young
man
was
that
i
was
put
to
look
out
for
but
i
say
it
pretty
hard
to
wait
on
a
sick
person
one
side
the
room
and
keep
watch
for
a
young
man
the
other
side
both
at
grier
you
bad
pouted
statira
do
you
believe
a
word
she
says
mr
barker
repeated
grier
well
i
do
care
said
statira
i
know
who
i
do
said
grier
and
i
did
know
who
you
meant
this
afternoon
when
you
was
standin
watch
the
window
and
says
you
there
he
is
and
i
had
to
run
so
quick
with
the
dipper
of
water
i
had
in
my
hand
to
water
the
plants
that
i
poured
it
all
over
the
front
of
my
you
believe
her
asked
statira
and
i
did
know
who
you
meant
proceeded
grier
busy
with
the
cups
and
saucers
when
you
kept
hurryin
me
up
to
change
it
quick
quick
how
long
you
are
i
know
he
get
away
i
he
will
and
i
had
to
just
on
a
shawl
and
rush
out
after
this
there
now
that
she
makin
it
all
up
cried
statira
she
put
on
a
sack
and
i
helped
her
on
with
it
myself
so
there
well
if
it
a
sack
and
after
all
the
young
man
was
gone
when
i
got
down
int
the
street
concluded
grier
solemnly
lemuel
had
thought
she
was
talking
about
him
but
now
a
pang
of
jealousy
went
through
him
and
showed
at
the
eyes
he
fixed
on
her
i
do
know
what
i
sh
done
she
resumed
demurely
if
i
have
found
barker
at
the
apothecary
and
got
to
come
home
me
but
of
course
the
same
as
if
it
was
the
young
man
lemuel
arm
fell
from
statira
waist
in
his
torment
why
lemuel
she
said
in
tender
reproach
why
you
coot
cried
grier
in
utter
amazement
at
his
and
burst
into
a
scream
of
laughter
she
took
the
teapot
from
the
stove
and
set
it
on
the
table
there
young
man
if
you
the
young
man
you
better
pull
up
to
the
table
and
have
something
to
start
your
ideas
let
him
come
and
lemuel
blushing
for
shame
at
his
stupidity
did
as
he
was
bid
i
got
the
greatest
mind
in
the
world
to
set
next
to
myself
said
grier
for
fear
she
should
miss
that
young
man
and
now
they
both
laughed
together
at
lemuel
but
the
girls
let
him
sit
between
them
and
statira
let
him
keep
one
of
her
hands
under
the
table
as
much
as
she
could
i
never
saw
such
a
jealous
piece
why
i
shall
begin
to
be
afraid
for
myself
what
should
you
think
of
going
to
housekeeping
with
me
i
do
believe
he
likes
the
idea
one
bit
statira
answered
for
him
oh
yes
i
do
lemuel
protested
you
tell
him
grier
demanded
of
her
she
nodded
with
saucy
defiance
well
you
got
along
and
about
the
statira
nodded
again
with
a
look
of
joyous
intelligence
at
lemuel
well
what
you
told
i
wonder
grier
added
seriously
to
lemuel
i
think
it
be
about
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
i
see
for
the
last
six
months
she
been
killin
herself
in
that
store
she
ca
ever
get
a
chance
to
set
down
a
minute
and
she
on
her
feet
from
mornin
till
night
and
i
think
it
more
half
that
that
made
her
sick
i
do
what
the
other
was
now
grier
stop
well
that
over
with
now
and
now
we
want
to
keep
you
out
that
store
i
been
lookin
out
for
this
place
for
a
good
while
she
can
go
onto
the
small
boxes
if
she
wants
to
and
she
can
set
down
all
the
time
and
she
have
a
whole
hour
for
her
dinner
and
she
can
work
by
the
piece
and
do
as
much
or
as
little
as
she
a
mind
to
but
if
a
mind
to
work
she
can
make
her
five
and
six
dollars
a
week
easy
stevens
nice
and
kind
and
he
looks
out
for
the
girls
that
ai
exactly
strong
not
but
what
as
strong
as
anybody
when
she
well
and
he
do
put
on
the
green
paper
work
because
got
arsenic
in
it
and
it
makes
your
head
ache
and
you
liable
to
blood
poisonin
one
the
girls
fainted
and
had
spasms
and
as
soon
as
he
found
it
out
he
took
her
right
off
and
he
just
like
clockwork
to
pay
i
think
it
do
everything
for
to
be
along
me
there
where
i
can
look
after
lemuel
said
he
thought
so
too
he
did
not
really
think
at
all
he
was
so
flattered
at
being
advised
with
about
statira
as
if
she
were
in
his
keeping
and
it
was
for
him
to
say
what
was
best
for
her
and
when
she
seemed
uncertain
about
his
real
opinion
and
said
she
was
not
going
to
do
anything
he
did
not
approve
of
he
could
scarcely
speak
for
rapture
but
he
protested
that
he
did
approve
of
the
scheme
entirely
but
you
should
want
we
girls
to
set
up
housekeeping
in
rooms
she
suggested
and
he
said
that
he
should
and
that
he
thought
it
would
be
more
independent
and
we
half
doin
it
now
said
grier
and
i
know
some
rooms
two
of
where
we
could
get
along
first
rate
and
not
cost
us
much
more
half
what
it
does
after
she
cleared
up
the
she
made
another
errand
downstairs
and
lemuel
and
statira
went
back
to
their
it
still
amazed
him
that
she
seemed
not
even
to
make
it
a
favour
to
him
she
seemed
to
think
it
was
favour
to
her
what
was
stranger
yet
was
that
he
could
not
feel
that
there
was
anything
wrong
or
foolish
about
it
he
thought
of
his
mother
severity
about
young
folks
sickishness
as
she
called
it
and
he
could
not
understand
it
he
knew
that
he
had
never
had
such
right
and
noble
thoughts
about
girls
before
perhaps
statira
was
better
than
other
girls
she
must
be
she
was
just
like
a
child
and
he
must
be
very
good
himself
to
be
anyways
fit
for
her
if
she
cared
so
much
for
him
it
must
be
a
sign
that
he
was
not
so
bad
as
he
had
sometimes
thought
a
great
many
things
went
through
his
mind
the
silent
comment
and
suggestion
of
their
talk
and
all
the
time
while
he
was
saying
something
or
listening
to
her
he
was
aware
of
the
overwhelming
wonder
of
her
being
so
frank
with
him
and
not
too
proud
or
ashamed
to
have
him
know
how
anxious
she
had
been
ever
since
they
first
met
for
fear
he
did
not
care
for
her
she
had
always
appeared
so
stylish
and
reserved
and
now
she
was
not
proud
at
all
he
tried
to
tell
her
how
it
had
been
with
him
the
last
three
weeks
all
that
he
could
say
was
that
he
had
been
afraid
to
come
she
laughed
and
said
the
idea
of
his
being
afraid
of
she
said
that
she
was
glad
of
everything
she
had
gone
through
at
times
she
lifted
herself
from
his
shoulder
and
coughed
but
that
was
when
she
had
been
laughing
or
crying
a
little
they
told
each
other
about
their
families
statira
said
she
had
not
really
any
folks
of
her
own
she
was
just
brought
up
by
her
aunt
and
lemuel
had
to
tell
her
that
his
mother
wore
bloomers
statira
said
she
guessed
she
should
not
care
much
for
the
bloomers
and
in
everything
she
tried
to
make
out
that
he
was
much
better
than
she
was
and
just
exactly
right
she
already
spoke
of
his
sister
by
her
first
name
and
she
entered
into
his
whole
life
as
if
she
had
always
known
him
he
said
she
must
come
with
him
to
hear
sewell
preach
sometime
but
she
declared
that
she
did
not
think
much
of
a
minister
who
could
behave
the
way
he
had
done
to
lemuel
he
defended
sewell
and
maintained
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
he
might
not
have
come
to
boston
and
so
might
never
have
seen
her
but
she
held
out
that
she
could
not
bear
sewell
and
that
she
knew
he
was
and
everything
lemuel
said
well
he
did
not
know
that
he
should
ever
have
anything
more
to
do
with
him
but
he
liked
to
hear
him
preach
and
he
guessed
he
tried
to
do
what
was
about
right
statira
made
him
promise
that
if
ever
he
met
sewell
again
he
would
not
make
up
to
him
any
way
and
she
would
not
tolerate
the
thought
of
miss
vane
what
you
two
about
demanded
grier
coming
suddenly
into
the
room
and
that
turned
their
retrospective
griefs
into
joy
again
i
scoldin
him
because
he
do
think
enough
of
himself
cried
statira
well
he
seems
to
take
it
pretty
meekly
said
grier
i
guess
you
did
scold
very
hard
now
young
man
she
added
to
lemuel
i
guess
you
better
be
goin
it
five
and
if
you
should
be
out
after
dark
and
the
bears
should
get
you
i
do
know
what
would
five
yet
pleaded
statira
that
old
watch
of
yours
is
always
tryin
to
beat
the
town
well
it
the
clock
that
ahead
this
time
said
grier
my
watch
says
quarter
of
come
now
you
let
him
go
or
he
come
back
any
they
had
a
parting
that
lemuel
mother
would
have
called
sickish
without
question
but
it
all
seemed
heavenly
sweet
and
right
statira
said
now
he
had
got
to
kiss
grier
too
and
when
he
insisted
her
chin
knocked
against
his
and
saved
her
lips
and
she
gave
him
a
good
box
on
the
ear
there
i
guess
that
do
for
one
while
she
said
arranging
her
tumbled
hair
but
there
more
kisses
where
that
came
from
for
both
of
you
if
you
want
coots
once
when
lemuel
was
little
he
had
a
fever
and
he
was
always
seeming
to
glide
down
the
stairs
without
touching
the
steps
with
his
feet
he
remembered
this
dream
now
when
he
reached
the
street
he
felt
as
if
he
had
floated
down
on
the
air
and
presently
he
was
back
in
his
little
den
at
the
hotel
he
did
not
know
how
he
ran
the
elevator
up
and
down
for
the
ladies
who
called
him
from
the
different
floors
and
he
took
note
of
the
sunday
difference
in
their
toilet
as
they
passed
in
to
tea
but
in
the
same
dreamy
way
after
the
boarders
had
supped
he
went
in
as
usual
with
nephew
less
cindery
than
on
from
the
cellar
and
harmon
silken
smooth
for
her
evening
worship
at
the
shrine
of
a
popular
preacher
from
new
york
the
sunday
evening
before
she
had
heard
an
agnostic
lecture
in
the
boston
theatre
and
she
said
she
wished
to
compare
notes
her
tranquillity
was
unruffled
by
the
fact
that
the
had
left
just
before
tea
she
presumed
they
could
get
along
just
as
well
without
her
as
with
her
the
boarders
had
spoiled
her
anyway
she
looked
round
at
lemuel
face
which
beamed
with
his
happiness
and
said
she
guessed
she
should
have
to
get
him
to
open
the
doors
and
seat
the
transients
the
next
few
days
till
she
could
get
another
it
did
not
seem
to
be
so
much
a
request
as
a
resolution
but
lemuel
willingly
assented
harmon
nephew
said
that
so
long
as
they
did
not
want
him
to
do
it
he
did
not
care
who
did
it
and
if
a
few
of
them
had
his
furnace
to
look
after
they
would
not
be
so
anxious
to
kick
xvi
lemuel
had
to
be
up
early
in
the
morning
to
get
the
bills
of
fare
which
harmon
called
the
meanyous
written
in
time
for
the
seven
breakfasters
and
after
opening
the
doors
with
fit
ceremony
he
had
to
run
backward
and
forward
to
answer
the
rings
at
the
elevator
and
to
pull
out
the
chairs
for
the
ladies
at
the
table
and
slip
them
back
under
them
as
they
sat
down
the
ladies
at
the
albans
expected
to
get
their
money
worth
but
their
exactions
in
most
things
were
of
use
to
lemuel
he
grew
constantly
nimbler
of
hand
and
foot
under
them
and
he
grew
he
ceased
to
hulk
in
mind
and
body
he
did
not
employ
this
new
mental
agility
in
devising
excuses
and
delays
he
left
that
to
harmon
whose
conscience
was
easy
in
it
but
from
seven
in
the
morning
till
eleven
at
night
when
the
ladies
came
in
from
the
theatre
he
was
so
promptly
so
comfortingly
at
their
service
that
they
all
said
they
did
not
see
how
they
had
ever
got
along
without
him
his
activities
took
the
form
of
interruptions
rather
than
constant
occupation
and
he
found
a
good
deal
of
time
on
his
hands
which
he
passed
in
reading
and
in
reveries
of
statira
at
the
hours
when
the
elevator
was
mostly
in
use
he
kept
a
book
in
it
with
him
and
at
other
times
he
had
it
in
the
office
as
harmon
called
his
little
booth
he
remained
there
reading
every
night
after
the
house
quieted
down
after
dinner
until
it
was
time
to
lock
up
for
the
night
and
several
times
evans
stopped
and
looked
in
at
him
where
he
sat
in
the
bad
combustion
of
the
gas
that
was
taking
the
country
tan
out
of
his
cheeks
one
night
when
he
came
in
late
and
lemuel
put
his
book
down
to
take
him
up
in
the
elevator
he
said
do
disturb
yourself
i
going
to
walk
up
but
he
lingered
at
the
door
looking
in
with
the
queer
smile
that
always
roused
the
ladies
fears
of
tacit
ridicule
i
suppose
you
do
find
it
necessary
he
said
finally
to
chase
a
now
when
you
want
to
find
your
way
to
a
given
point
lemuel
reddened
and
dropped
his
head
he
had
already
recognised
in
evans
the
gentleman
from
whose
kindly
curiosity
he
had
turned
that
first
day
in
the
suspicion
that
he
might
be
a
beat
no
he
said
i
guess
i
can
go
pretty
near
everywhere
in
boston
well
said
evans
it
was
an
ingenious
system
how
do
you
like
boston
i
like
it
but
i
not
seen
many
other
places
answered
lemuel
cautiously
well
if
you
live
here
long
enough
you
wo
care
to
see
any
other
places
you
know
they
not
worth
lemuel
looked
up
as
if
he
did
not
understand
exactly
and
evans
stepped
in
and
lifted
the
book
he
had
been
reading
it
was
one
he
had
bought
at
second
hand
while
he
was
with
miss
vane
a
tough
little
epitome
of
the
philosophies
in
all
times
the
crabbed
english
version
of
a
dry
german
original
evans
turned
its
leaves
over
do
you
find
it
a
very
exciting
story
he
asked
why
it
is
a
story
said
lemuel
in
simple
surprise
no
asked
evans
i
thought
it
must
be
most
of
the
young
gentlemen
who
run
the
elevators
i
travel
in
read
stories
do
you
like
this
kind
of
reading
lemuel
reflected
and
then
he
said
he
thought
you
ought
to
find
out
about
such
things
if
you
got
a
chance
yes
said
the
editor
musingly
i
suppose
one
ought
to
throw
any
sort
of
chance
away
but
you
sure
you
do
prefer
the
novels
excuse
my
asking
you
oh
perfectly
excusable
said
lemuel
he
added
that
he
liked
a
good
novel
too
when
he
could
get
hold
of
it
you
must
come
to
my
room
some
day
and
see
if
you
ca
get
hold
of
one
there
or
if
you
prefer
metaphysics
i
got
shelves
full
that
welcome
to
i
suppose
he
added
you
had
been
in
boston
a
great
while
when
i
met
you
that
day
no
said
lemuel
dropping
his
head
again
i
had
just
as
if
he
saw
that
something
painful
lurked
under
the
remembrance
of
the
time
for
lemuel
the
editor
desisted
the
next
morning
he
stopped
on
his
way
to
breakfast
with
some
books
which
he
handed
to
lemuel
do
feel
at
all
obliged
to
read
them
he
said
because
i
lend
them
to
you
they
wo
be
of
the
least
use
to
you
if
you
do
i
guess
that
anything
you
like
will
be
worth
reading
said
lemuel
flattered
by
the
trouble
so
chief
a
boarder
as
evans
had
taken
with
him
not
if
they
supplied
a
want
you
did
feel
you
seem
to
be
fond
of
books
and
after
a
while
you
be
wanting
to
lend
them
yourself
give
you
a
little
hint
that
i
too
old
to
profit
by
remember
that
you
can
lend
a
person
more
books
in
a
day
than
he
can
read
in
a
his
laugh
kept
lemuel
shy
of
him
still
in
spite
of
a
willingness
that
the
editor
showed
for
their
better
acquaintance
he
seemed
to
wish
to
know
about
lemuel
particularly
since
he
had
recognised
the
pursuer
of
the
in
him
and
this
made
lemuel
close
up
the
more
he
would
have
liked
to
talk
with
him
about
the
books
evans
had
lent
him
but
when
the
editor
stopped
at
the
office
door
where
lemuel
sat
reading
one
of
them
and
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
it
the
boy
felt
that
somehow
it
was
not
exactly
his
opinion
that
evans
was
getting
at
and
this
sense
of
being
inspected
and
arranged
in
another
mind
though
he
could
not
formulate
the
operation
in
his
own
somehow
wounded
and
repelled
him
it
was
not
that
the
editor
ever
said
anything
that
was
not
kind
and
friendly
he
was
always
doing
kind
and
friendly
things
and
he
appeared
to
take
a
real
interest
in
lemuel
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
after
lemuel
had
added
the
head
waitership
to
his
other
duties
evans
stopped
in
going
out
of
the
and
put
a
dollar
in
his
hand
what
is
it
for
asked
lemuel
for
really
i
do
know
it
must
be
said
the
editor
in
surprise
but
with
a
rising
curiosity
i
never
know
what
it
lemuel
turned
red
and
handed
it
back
i
do
know
as
i
want
any
money
i
have
that
night
after
dinner
when
evans
was
passing
the
office
door
on
his
way
out
of
the
hotel
lemuel
stopped
him
and
said
with
embarrassment
mr
evans
i
do
want
you
should
think
i
did
appreciate
your
kindness
this
ah
i
not
sure
it
was
kindness
said
evans
with
immediate
interest
why
did
you
take
the
money
well
i
told
you
why
said
lemuel
overcoming
the
obscure
reluctance
he
felt
at
evans
manner
as
best
he
could
i
been
thinking
it
over
and
i
guess
i
was
right
but
i
did
know
whether
i
had
expressed
it
the
best
the
way
could
be
improved
but
why
did
you
think
you
had
earned
my
dollar
i
do
do
anything
but
open
the
doors
and
show
people
to
their
places
i
do
call
that
but
if
you
were
a
waiter
and
served
at
table
i
would
one
said
lemuel
with
a
touch
of
indignation
and
i
should
take
presents
evans
leaned
against
the
have
you
heard
of
the
college
students
who
wait
at
the
mountain
hotels
in
vacation
they
all
take
fees
do
you
think
yourself
better
than
they
are
yes
i
do
cried
lemuel
well
i
do
know
but
you
are
said
the
editor
thoughtfully
but
i
think
i
should
distinguish
perhaps
there
no
shame
in
waiting
at
table
but
there
is
in
taking
yes
that
what
i
meant
said
lemuel
a
little
sorry
for
his
heat
i
should
be
ashamed
to
do
any
kind
of
work
and
to
take
my
pay
for
it
but
i
should
want
to
have
folks
giving
me
money
over
and
above
as
if
i
was
a
the
editor
stood
looking
him
absently
in
the
face
after
a
moment
he
asked
what
part
of
new
england
did
you
come
from
barker
i
came
from
the
middle
part
of
the
state
from
willoughby
do
those
ideas
those
principles
of
yours
prevail
there
i
do
know
whether
they
do
or
not
said
lemuel
if
you
were
sure
they
did
i
should
like
to
engage
board
there
for
next
summer
said
the
editor
going
out
it
was
monday
night
a
leisure
time
with
him
and
he
was
going
out
to
see
a
friend
a
minister
with
whom
monday
night
was
also
leisure
time
after
he
was
gone
some
of
the
other
boarders
began
to
drop
in
from
the
lectures
and
concerts
which
they
frequented
in
the
evening
the
ladies
had
all
some
favour
to
ask
of
lemuel
some
real
or
fancied
need
of
his
help
in
return
for
his
promise
or
performance
they
each
gave
him
advice
what
they
expressed
collectively
was
that
they
should
think
that
he
would
put
his
eyes
out
reading
by
that
gas
and
that
he
had
better
look
out
or
he
would
ruin
his
health
anyway
reading
so
much
they
asked
him
how
much
time
he
got
for
sleep
and
they
said
that
from
twelve
till
six
was
not
enough
and
that
he
was
just
killing
himself
they
had
all
offered
to
lend
him
books
the
least
literary
among
them
had
a
sort
of
house
pride
in
his
fondness
for
books
their
sympathy
with
this
taste
of
his
amused
their
husbands
who
tolerated
it
but
in
their
hearts
regarded
it
as
a
womanish
weakness
indicating
a
want
of
fibre
in
lemuel
harmon
as
a
business
woman
and
therefore
occupying
a
middle
ground
between
the
sexes
did
not
exactly
know
herself
what
to
make
of
her
clerk
studiousness
all
that
she
could
say
was
that
he
kept
up
with
his
work
she
assumed
that
before
lemuel
coming
she
had
been
the
sole
motive
power
of
the
house
but
it
was
really
a
sort
of
democracy
and
was
managed
by
the
majority
of
its
inmates
an
element
of
demagoguery
tampered
with
the
irish
vote
in
the
person
of
jerry
nominally
porter
but
actually
factotum
who
had
hitherto
pending
the
strikes
of
the
different
functionaries
filled
the
offices
now
united
in
lemuel
he
had
never
been
clerk
because
his
literature
went
no
further
than
the
ability
to
write
his
name
and
to
read
a
passage
of
the
constitution
in
qualifying
for
the
suffrage
he
did
not
like
the
new
order
of
things
but
he
was
without
a
party
and
helpless
to
do
more
than
neglect
the
when
he
had
reason
to
think
lemuel
had
sounded
it
about
eleven
the
came
in
with
the
two
girl
fresh
from
the
outside
air
and
gay
from
the
opera
they
had
been
hearing
the
young
man
told
lemuel
he
ought
to
go
to
see
it
after
the
girls
had
opened
their
door
one
of
them
came
running
back
to
the
elevator
and
called
down
to
lemuel
that
there
was
no
and
would
he
please
send
some
up
lemuel
brought
it
up
himself
and
when
he
knocked
at
the
door
the
same
girl
opened
it
and
made
a
pretty
outcry
over
the
trouble
she
had
given
him
i
supposed
of
course
jerry
would
bring
it
she
said
contritely
and
as
if
for
some
atonement
she
added
wo
you
come
in
barker
and
see
my
picture
lemuel
stood
in
the
gush
of
the
hesitating
and
the
called
out
to
him
jollily
come
in
barker
and
help
me
play
he
was
standing
before
the
picture
with
his
overcoat
on
and
his
hat
in
his
hand
first
appearance
on
any
stage
he
added
and
as
lemuel
entered
if
i
were
you
he
said
i
fire
that
porter
out
of
the
hotel
he
outlived
his
it
a
shame
your
having
to
bring
the
water
said
miss
swan
she
was
the
girl
who
had
spoken
before
the
other
one
came
forward
and
said
wo
you
sit
down
she
spoke
to
lemuel
the
answered
thank
you
i
do
care
if
i
lemuel
did
not
know
whether
to
stay
nor
what
to
say
of
miss
picture
and
he
thanked
the
young
lady
and
remained
standing
o
jessie
jessie
cried
miss
swan
the
other
went
to
her
tranquilly
as
if
used
to
such
vehement
appeals
just
how
my
poor
cow
looks
since
i
painted
out
that
grass
she
has
got
a
leg
to
stand
on
the
did
nothing
but
make
jokes
about
the
picture
i
think
she
looks
pretty
well
for
a
cow
that
you
must
have
had
to
study
from
a
nearest
you
could
come
to
a
cow
in
miss
carver
the
other
young
lady
ignored
his
joking
and
after
some
criticisms
on
the
picture
left
him
and
miss
swan
to
talk
it
over
she
talked
to
lemuel
and
asked
him
if
he
had
read
a
book
he
glanced
at
on
the
table
and
seemed
willing
to
make
him
feel
at
ease
but
she
did
not
he
thought
she
was
very
proud
and
he
believed
she
wanted
him
to
go
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
go
her
eyes
were
so
still
and
pure
but
they
dwelt
very
coldly
upon
him
her
voice
was
like
that
look
put
into
sound
it
was
rather
but
very
sweet
and
pure
and
cold
he
hardly
knew
what
he
said
he
felt
hot
and
he
waited
for
some
chance
to
get
away
at
last
he
heard
miss
swan
saying
you
go
berry
so
and
saw
her
giving
the
student
her
hand
with
a
bow
of
burlesque
desolation
lemuel
prepared
to
go
too
all
his
rusticity
came
back
upon
him
and
he
said
well
i
wish
you
good
it
seemed
to
him
that
miss
carver
still
eyes
looked
a
sort
of
starry
scorn
after
him
he
found
that
he
had
brought
away
the
book
they
had
been
talking
about
and
he
was
a
long
time
in
question
whether
he
had
better
take
it
back
at
once
or
give
it
to
her
when
she
came
to
breakfast
he
went
to
bed
in
the
same
trouble
of
mind
every
night
he
had
fallen
asleep
with
statira
in
his
thoughts
but
now
it
was
miss
carver
that
he
thought
of
and
more
and
more
uncomfortably
he
asked
himself
what
she
would
say
if
she
saw
his
mother
in
the
bloomers
she
was
herself
not
dressed
so
fashionably
as
statira
but
very
nicely
xvii
at
sewell
house
the
maid
told
evans
to
walk
up
into
the
study
without
seating
him
first
in
the
as
if
that
were
needless
with
so
intimate
a
friend
of
the
family
he
found
sewell
at
his
desk
and
he
began
at
once
without
the
forms
of
greeting
if
you
do
like
that
other
subject
i
got
a
new
one
for
you
and
you
could
write
a
sermon
on
it
that
would
make
you
look
at
it
from
the
newspaper
point
of
view
returned
sewell
in
the
same
humour
i
not
an
and
i
do
want
to
make
talk
in
your
sense
i
do
know
that
i
want
to
make
talk
at
all
i
should
prefer
to
make
thought
to
make
well
said
the
editor
this
would
do
all
would
you
come
to
hear
me
if
i
wrote
the
sermon
ah
that
asking
a
good
why
do
you
develop
your
idea
in
an
article
you
always
bragging
that
you
preach
to
a
larger
congregation
than
i
propose
to
let
you
preach
to
my
congregation
too
if
you
write
this
sermon
i
talked
to
you
before
about
reporting
your
sermons
in
they
would
be
a
feature
and
if
we
could
open
with
this
one
and
have
a
good
editorial
on
it
disputing
some
of
your
positions
and
treating
certain
others
with
a
little
satire
at
the
same
time
maintaining
a
very
respectful
attitude
towards
you
on
the
whole
and
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
strong
and
increasing
interest
in
your
which
we
were
the
first
to
recognise
it
would
be
a
card
we
might
agree
beforehand
on
the
points
the
editorial
was
to
touch
and
so
make
one
hand
wash
another
see
i
see
that
journalism
has
eaten
into
your
soul
what
is
your
subject
well
in
general
terms
and
in
a
single
word
do
you
think
that
would
be
rather
taking
sewell
in
his
striking
sermon
on
complicity
and
so
forth
it
would
be
a
great
hit
and
it
would
stand
a
chance
of
sticking
like
emerson
delightful
the
most
amusing
part
is
that
you
really
a
grain
of
business
in
your
bushel
of
sewell
wheeled
about
in
his
and
sat
facing
his
guest
deeply
sunken
in
the
low
easy
seat
he
always
took
when
did
this
famous
idea
occur
to
you
he
pursued
swinging
his
glasses
by
their
cord
about
three
weeks
ago
at
the
theatre
there
was
one
of
those
pieces
on
that
make
you
despair
of
the
stage
and
ashamed
of
writing
a
play
even
to
be
rejected
by
it
a
farrago
of
indecently
amusing
innuendoes
and
laughably
vile
situations
such
as
if
they
were
put
into
a
book
would
prevent
its
being
sent
through
the
mail
the
theatre
apparently
can
still
be
as
filthy
in
suggestion
as
it
was
at
the
restoration
and
not
shock
its
audiences
there
were
all
sorts
of
people
there
that
night
young
girls
who
had
come
with
young
men
for
an
evening
polite
amusement
families
husbands
and
wives
single
women
and
average
bachelors
i
do
think
the
ordinary
theatrical
audience
is
of
a
high
grade
intellectually
it
third
or
fourth
rate
but
morally
it
seems
quite
as
good
as
other
public
assemblages
all
the
people
were
nicely
dressed
and
they
sat
there
before
that
nasty
mess
it
was
an
english
comedy
where
all
the
jokes
turn
upon
the
belief
of
the
characters
that
their
wives
and
husbands
are
the
parents
of
illegitimate
offspring
and
listened
with
as
smooth
as
if
they
were
not
responsible
for
it
but
all
at
once
it
occurred
to
me
that
they
responsible
every
one
of
them
as
responsible
as
the
players
as
the
author
did
you
come
out
of
the
theatre
at
that
point
asked
sewell
oh
i
was
responsible
too
but
i
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
ashamed
of
my
share
in
the
if
you
were
the
only
one
conscious
of
it
your
merit
was
very
great
suggested
the
minister
well
i
should
like
the
others
to
be
conscious
of
it
too
that
why
i
want
you
to
preach
my
sermon
i
want
you
to
tell
your
people
and
my
people
that
the
one
who
buys
sin
or
shame
or
corruption
of
any
sort
is
as
guilty
as
the
one
who
sells
it
is
a
new
theory
said
sewell
still
refusing
to
give
up
his
ironical
tone
it
was
discovered
some
time
ago
that
this
was
so
before
well
i
just
discovered
that
it
ought
to
be
so
before
man
said
evans
still
you
not
the
first
said
sewell
yes
said
the
editor
i
think
i
am
from
my
peculiar
standpoint
the
other
day
a
friend
of
mine
an
upright
just
worthy
man
no
one
more
so
was
telling
me
of
a
shocking
instance
of
our
national
corruption
he
had
just
got
home
from
europe
and
he
had
brought
a
lot
of
dutiable
things
that
a
customs
inspector
passed
for
a
trifling
sum
that
was
all
very
well
but
the
inspector
afterwards
came
round
with
a
confidential
claim
for
a
hundred
dollars
and
the
figures
to
show
that
the
legal
duties
would
have
been
eight
or
ten
times
as
much
my
friend
was
glad
to
pay
the
hundred
dollars
but
he
defied
me
to
name
any
country
in
europe
where
such
a
piece
of
official
rascality
was
possible
he
said
it
made
him
ashamed
of
america
evans
leaned
his
head
back
against
his
chair
and
laughed
yes
said
sewell
with
a
sigh
and
no
longer
feigning
lightness
that
well
now
said
evans
do
you
think
it
your
duty
to
help
people
realise
that
they
ca
regard
such
transactions
haut
en
if
they
happen
to
have
taken
part
in
them
i
have
heard
of
the
shameful
condition
of
things
down
in
maine
where
i
told
the
french
canadians
who
come
in
regularly
expect
to
sell
their
votes
to
the
highest
bidder
at
every
election
since
my
new
system
of
ethics
occurred
to
me
i
fancied
that
there
must
have
always
been
a
shameful
state
of
things
there
if
americans
could
grow
up
in
the
willingness
to
buy
votes
i
want
to
have
people
recognise
that
there
is
no
superiority
for
them
in
such
an
affair
that
there
nothing
but
inferiority
that
the
man
who
has
the
money
and
the
wit
to
corrupt
is
a
far
baser
rascal
than
the
man
who
has
the
ignorance
and
the
poverty
to
be
corrupted
i
would
make
this
principle
seek
out
every
weak
spot
every
sore
spot
in
the
whole
social
constitution
i
sick
to
death
of
the
frauds
that
we
practise
upon
ourselves
in
order
to
be
able
to
injure
others
just
consider
the
infernal
ease
of
mind
in
which
men
remain
concerning
men
share
in
the
social
evil
ah
my
dear
friend
you
ca
expect
me
to
consider
in
my
pulpit
cried
the
minister
no
i
could
consider
it
in
my
paper
i
suppose
we
must
leave
that
where
it
is
unless
we
can
affect
it
by
analogy
and
show
that
there
is
infamy
for
both
parties
to
any
sin
committed
in
common
you
must
select
your
instances
in
other
directions
but
you
can
find
plenty
of
them
enough
and
to
spare
it
would
give
the
series
a
tremendous
said
evans
relapsing
into
his
habitual
tone
if
you
would
tackle
this
subject
in
your
first
sermon
for
publication
there
would
be
money
in
it
the
thing
would
make
a
success
in
the
paper
and
you
could
get
somebody
to
reprint
it
in
pamphlet
form
come
what
do
you
say
i
should
say
that
you
had
just
been
doing
something
you
were
ashamed
of
answered
sewell
people
do
have
these
tremendous
moral
awakenings
for
and
you
do
think
my
present
state
of
mind
is
a
gradual
outgrowth
of
my
first
consciousness
of
the
common
responsibility
of
actors
and
audience
in
the
representation
of
a
shameless
comedy
no
i
should
think
it
was
said
the
minister
securely
well
you
evans
twisted
himself
about
in
his
chair
and
hung
his
legs
over
one
of
the
arms
the
real
reason
why
i
wish
you
to
preach
this
sermon
is
because
i
have
just
been
offering
a
fee
to
the
at
our
and
you
feel
degraded
with
him
by
his
acceptance
for
it
a
no
that
the
strangest
thing
about
it
i
have
a
monopoly
of
the
degradation
for
he
did
take
my
ah
then
a
sermon
wo
help
why
would
he
take
it
he
said
he
did
know
as
he
wanted
any
money
he
had
earned
said
evans
with
a
touch
of
mimicry
the
minister
started
up
from
his
lounging
attitude
is
his
name
barker
he
asked
with
unerring
prescience
yes
said
evans
with
a
little
surprise
do
you
know
him
yes
returned
the
minister
falling
back
in
his
chair
helplessly
not
luxuriously
so
well
that
i
knew
it
was
he
almost
as
soon
as
you
came
into
the
room
what
harm
have
you
been
doing
him
demanded
the
editor
in
parody
of
the
minister
acuteness
in
guessing
the
guilty
operation
of
his
own
mind
the
greatest
i
the
cause
of
his
being
in
this
is
very
interesting
said
evans
we
are
companions
in
crime
pals
it
a
great
honour
but
what
strikes
me
as
being
so
interesting
is
that
we
appear
to
feel
remorse
for
our
misdeeds
and
i
was
almost
persuaded
the
other
day
by
an
observer
of
our
species
that
remorse
had
gone
out
or
rather
had
never
existed
except
in
the
fancy
of
innocent
people
that
real
criminals
like
ourselves
were
afraid
of
being
found
out
but
were
in
the
least
sorry
perhaps
if
we
are
sorry
it
proves
that
we
need
be
let
judge
each
other
i
told
you
what
my
sin
against
barker
is
and
i
know
yours
in
general
terms
it
a
fearful
thing
to
be
the
cause
of
a
human
soul
presence
in
boston
but
what
did
you
do
to
bring
it
about
who
is
barker
where
did
he
come
from
what
was
his
previous
condition
of
servitude
he
puzzles
me
a
good
oh
i
tell
you
said
sewell
and
he
gave
his
personal
chapter
in
lemuel
history
evans
interrupted
him
at
one
point
and
what
became
of
the
poem
he
brought
down
with
him
it
was
stolen
out
of
his
pocket
one
night
when
he
slept
in
the
ah
then
he
ca
offer
it
to
me
and
he
seems
very
far
from
writing
any
more
i
can
still
keep
his
acquaintance
go
sewell
told
in
amusing
detail
of
the
wayfarer
lodge
where
he
had
found
barker
after
supposing
he
had
gone
home
evans
seemed
more
interested
in
the
place
than
in
the
minister
meeting
with
lemuel
there
which
sewell
fancied
he
had
painted
rather
well
describing
lemuel
severity
and
his
own
anxiety
there
said
the
editor
there
you
have
it
a
practical
illustration
our
civilisation
has
had
to
come
to
it
come
to
what
sewell
made
an
impatient
gesture
do
sacrifice
the
consideration
of
a
great
principle
cried
evans
to
the
petty
effect
of
a
good
story
on
an
appreciative
listener
i
realise
your
predicament
but
do
you
see
that
in
establishing
and
regulating
a
place
like
that
the
city
of
boston
has
instinctively
sanctioned
my
idea
you
may
say
that
it
is
aiding
and
abetting
the
by
giving
vagrants
food
and
shelter
but
other
philosophers
will
contend
that
it
is
blindly
perhaps
fulfilling
the
destiny
of
the
future
state
which
will
at
once
employ
and
support
all
its
citizens
that
it
is
prophetically
recognising
my
new
principle
of
complicity
your
new
principle
cried
sewell
you
have
merely
given
a
new
name
to
one
of
the
oldest
principles
in
the
moral
and
that
is
a
good
deal
to
do
i
can
tell
you
said
evans
all
the
principles
are
pretty
old
now
but
do
give
way
to
an
ignoble
resentment
of
my
interruption
go
on
about
after
some
feints
that
there
was
nothing
more
important
to
tell
sewell
went
on
to
the
end
and
when
he
had
come
to
it
evans
shook
his
head
it
looks
pretty
black
for
you
but
it
a
beautifully
perfect
case
of
complicity
what
do
you
propose
to
do
now
you
rediscovered
him
oh
i
do
know
i
hope
no
more
mischief
if
i
could
only
get
him
back
on
his
farm
yes
i
suppose
that
would
be
the
best
thing
but
i
dare
say
he
go
back
that
been
my
experience
with
they
talked
this
aspect
of
the
case
over
more
fully
and
evans
said
well
i
would
go
back
to
such
a
place
myself
after
i
once
had
a
glimpse
of
boston
but
i
suppose
it
right
to
wish
that
barker
would
i
hope
his
mother
will
come
to
visit
him
while
he
in
the
hotel
i
would
give
a
good
deal
to
see
her
fancy
her
coming
down
in
her
bloomers
and
the
poor
fellow
being
ashamed
of
her
it
would
be
a
very
good
subject
for
a
play
does
she
wear
a
hat
or
a
bonnet
what
sort
of
goes
with
that
odalisque
style
of
dress
a
turban
i
mrs
barker
said
the
minister
unable
to
deny
himself
the
fleeting
comfort
of
the
editor
humorous
view
of
the
situation
is
as
far
from
a
odalisque
as
any
lady
i
ever
seen
in
spite
of
her
oriental
costume
if
i
remember
her
was
not
gathered
at
the
ankles
but
hung
loose
like
occidental
trousers
and
the
day
we
met
she
wore
simply
her
own
hair
there
was
not
much
of
it
on
top
and
she
had
it
cut
short
in
the
neck
she
was
rather
a
terrible
figure
her
having
ever
been
married
would
have
been
inconceivable
except
for
her
i
should
like
to
have
seen
her
said
evans
laughing
back
in
his
chair
she
was
worth
seeing
as
a
survival
of
the
superficial
fermentation
of
the
period
of
our
social
history
when
it
was
believed
that
women
could
be
like
men
if
they
chose
and
ought
to
be
if
they
ever
meant
to
show
their
natural
superiority
but
she
was
not
the
son
very
handsome
i
can
see
that
the
lady
boarders
think
him
do
you
find
him
at
all
remarkable
otherwise
what
dismayed
me
more
than
his
poetry
even
was
that
when
he
gave
that
up
he
seemed
to
have
no
particular
oh
he
reads
a
good
deal
and
pretty
serious
books
and
he
goes
to
hear
all
the
sermons
and
lectures
in
i
thought
he
came
to
mine
only
sighed
the
minister
with
a
retrospective
suffering
well
what
can
be
done
for
him
now
i
feel
my
complicity
with
barker
as
poignantly
as
you
could
ah
you
see
how
the
principle
applies
everywhere
cried
the
editor
joyously
he
added
but
i
really
think
that
for
the
present
you
do
better
than
let
barker
alone
he
getting
on
very
well
at
harmon
and
although
the
conditions
at
the
albans
are
more
transitory
than
most
sublunary
things
barker
appears
to
be
a
fixture
our
little
system
has
begun
to
revolve
round
him
unconsciously
he
keeps
us
well
said
sewell
consenting
to
be
a
little
comforted
he
was
about
to
go
more
particularly
into
the
facts
but
sewell
came
in
just
then
and
he
obviously
left
the
subject
evans
did
not
sit
down
again
after
rising
to
greet
her
and
presently
he
said
good
night
she
turned
to
her
husband
what
were
you
talking
about
when
i
came
in
when
you
came
in
yes
you
both
had
that
look
i
can
always
tell
it
of
having
suddenly
oh
said
sewell
pretending
to
arrange
the
things
on
his
desk
evans
had
been
suggesting
the
subject
for
a
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
he
continued
hardily
and
he
been
telling
me
about
barker
turned
up
of
course
said
sewell
what
happened
to
him
now
nothing
apparently
but
some
repeated
strokes
of
prosperity
he
has
become
clerk
and
at
the
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
him
evans
advises
me
to
do
well
that
sensible
at
any
rate
said
sewell
i
really
think
you
done
quite
enough
david
and
now
he
can
be
left
to
manage
for
himself
especially
as
he
seems
to
be
doing
oh
he
doing
as
well
as
i
could
hope
and
better
but
i
not
sure
that
i
should
have
personally
preferred
a
continued
course
of
calamity
for
him
i
shall
never
be
quite
at
peace
about
him
till
i
get
him
back
on
his
farm
at
willoughby
well
that
you
will
never
do
and
you
may
as
well
rest
easy
about
i
do
know
as
to
never
doing
it
said
sewell
all
prosperity
especially
the
prosperity
connected
with
harmon
hotel
is
transitory
and
i
may
succeed
does
everything
go
on
there
in
the
old
way
does
evans
say
sewell
did
not
refer
to
any
former
knowledge
of
the
albans
but
to
a
remote
acquaintance
with
the
character
and
methods
of
harmon
with
whom
the
sewells
had
once
boarded
she
was
then
freshly
widowed
by
the
loss
of
her
first
husband
and
had
launched
her
earliest
on
that
sea
of
disaster
where
she
had
buoyantly
outridden
every
storm
and
had
floated
triumphantly
on
the
top
of
every
ingulfing
wave
they
recalled
the
difficult
navigation
of
that
primitive
craft
in
which
each
of
the
boarders
had
taken
a
hand
at
the
helm
and
their
reminiscences
of
her
financial
embarrassments
were
mixed
with
those
of
the
unfailing
serenity
that
seemed
not
to
know
defeat
and
with
fond
memories
of
her
goodness
of
heart
and
her
ideal
devotion
in
any
case
of
sickness
or
trouble
i
should
think
the
prosperity
of
harmon
would
convince
the
most
negative
of
agnostics
that
there
was
an
overruling
providence
if
nothing
else
did
said
sewell
it
so
defiant
of
all
law
so
delightfully
independent
of
well
let
barker
alone
with
her
then
said
his
wife
rising
to
leave
him
to
the
hours
of
late
reading
which
she
had
never
been
able
to
break
up
xviii
after
agreeing
with
his
wife
that
he
had
better
leave
barker
alone
sewell
did
not
feel
easy
in
doing
so
he
had
that
note
which
miss
vane
had
given
him
and
though
he
did
not
believe
since
evans
had
reported
barker
refusal
of
his
fee
that
the
boy
would
take
it
he
was
still
constrained
to
do
something
with
it
before
giving
it
back
to
her
he
decided
at
least
to
see
barker
and
learn
about
his
prospects
and
expectations
he
might
find
some
way
of
making
himself
useful
to
him
in
a
state
of
independence
he
found
lemuel
much
more
accessible
than
formerly
and
their
interview
was
more
nearly
amicable
sewell
said
that
he
had
been
delighted
to
hear
of
lemuel
whereabouts
from
his
old
friend
evans
and
to
know
that
they
were
housed
together
he
said
that
he
used
to
know
harmon
long
ago
and
that
she
was
a
woman
though
without
much
forecast
he
even
assented
to
lemuel
hasty
generalisation
of
her
as
a
perfect
lady
though
they
both
felt
a
certain
inaccuracy
in
this
and
sewell
repeated
that
she
was
a
woman
of
excellent
heart
and
turned
to
a
more
intimate
inquest
of
lemuel
life
he
tried
to
find
out
how
he
employed
his
leisure
time
saying
that
he
always
sympathised
with
young
men
away
from
home
and
suggesting
the
and
the
frequent
lectures
at
the
young
men
christian
union
for
his
odd
moments
he
learned
that
lemuel
had
not
many
of
these
during
the
week
and
that
on
sundays
he
spent
all
the
time
he
could
get
in
hearing
the
different
noted
ministers
for
the
rest
he
learned
that
lemuel
was
very
much
interested
in
the
city
and
appeared
to
be
rapidly
absorbing
both
its
present
civilisation
and
its
past
history
he
was
unsmilingly
amused
at
the
comments
of
mixed
shrewdness
and
crudity
which
lemuel
was
betrayed
into
at
times
beyond
certain
limits
of
diffidence
that
he
had
apparently
set
himself
at
his
blunders
and
misconceptions
at
the
truth
divined
by
the
very
innocence
of
his
youth
and
inexperience
he
found
out
that
lemuel
had
not
been
at
home
since
he
came
to
boston
he
had
expected
to
go
at
thanksgiving
but
it
came
so
soon
after
he
had
got
his
place
that
he
hated
to
ask
the
folks
were
all
well
and
he
would
send
the
kind
remembrances
which
the
minister
asked
him
to
give
his
mother
sewell
tried
to
find
out
in
saying
that
sewell
and
himself
would
always
be
glad
to
see
him
whether
lemuel
had
any
social
life
outside
of
the
albans
but
here
he
was
sensible
that
a
door
was
shut
against
him
and
finally
he
had
not
the
courage
to
do
more
about
that
money
from
miss
vane
than
to
say
that
from
time
to
time
he
had
sums
intrusted
him
and
that
if
lemuel
had
any
pressing
need
of
money
he
must
borrow
of
him
he
fancied
he
had
managed
that
rather
delicately
for
lemuel
thanked
him
without
severity
and
said
he
should
get
along
now
he
guessed
but
he
was
much
obliged
neither
of
them
mentioned
miss
vane
and
upon
the
whole
the
minister
was
not
sure
that
he
had
got
much
nearer
the
boy
after
all
certainly
he
formed
no
adequate
idea
of
the
avidity
and
thoroughness
with
which
lemuel
was
learning
his
boston
it
was
wholly
a
public
boston
which
unfolded
itself
during
the
winter
to
his
eager
curiosity
and
he
knew
nothing
of
the
social
intricacies
of
which
it
seems
solely
to
consist
for
so
many
of
us
to
him
boston
society
was
represented
by
the
coteries
of
homeless
sojourners
in
the
albans
boston
life
was
transacted
by
the
ministers
the
lecturers
the
public
meetings
the
concerts
the
the
policemen
the
the
newspapers
the
theatres
the
ships
at
the
docks
the
historical
landmarks
the
charity
apparatus
the
effect
was
a
ferment
in
his
mind
in
which
there
was
nothing
clear
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
to
change
his
opinions
every
day
he
was
whirled
round
and
round
he
never
saw
the
same
object
twice
the
same
he
did
not
know
whether
he
learned
or
unlearned
most
with
the
pride
that
comes
to
youth
from
the
mere
novelty
of
its
experiences
was
mixed
a
shame
for
his
former
ignorance
an
exasperation
at
his
inability
to
grasp
their
whole
meaning
his
activities
in
acquainting
himself
with
boston
interested
evans
who
tried
to
learn
just
what
his
impression
was
but
this
was
the
last
thing
that
lemuel
could
have
distinctly
imparted
well
upon
the
whole
he
asked
one
day
what
do
you
think
from
what
you
seen
of
it
which
is
the
better
place
boston
or
willoughby
pastures
if
you
were
friendless
and
homeless
would
you
rather
be
cast
away
in
the
city
or
in
the
country
lemuel
did
not
hesitate
about
this
in
the
city
they
have
got
any
idea
in
the
country
what
done
to
help
folks
along
in
the
city
is
that
so
asked
evans
it
against
tradition
he
suggested
yes
i
know
that
lemuel
assented
and
in
the
country
they
think
the
city
is
a
place
where
nobody
cares
for
you
and
everybody
is
against
you
and
wants
to
impose
upon
you
well
when
i
first
came
to
boston
he
continued
with
a
consciousness
of
things
that
evans
did
not
betray
his
own
knowledge
of
i
thought
so
too
and
i
had
a
pretty
hard
time
for
a
while
it
do
seem
as
if
people
care
for
you
except
to
make
something
out
of
you
but
if
any
one
happens
to
find
out
that
you
in
trouble
there
ten
times
as
much
done
for
you
in
the
city
as
there
is
in
the
perhaps
that
because
there
are
ten
times
as
many
to
do
it
said
evans
in
the
hope
of
provoking
this
impartial
spirit
further
no
it
is
that
altogether
it
because
they
seen
ten
times
as
much
trouble
and
know
how
to
take
hold
of
it
better
i
think
our
folks
in
the
country
have
been
flattered
up
too
much
if
some
of
them
could
come
down
here
and
see
how
things
are
carried
on
they
would
be
surprised
they
would
believe
it
if
you
told
i
did
know
we
were
so
exemplary
said
evans
oh
city
folks
have
their
faults
too
said
lemuel
smiling
in
recognition
of
the
irony
no
what
lemuel
seemed
uncertain
whether
to
say
it
well
they
too
evans
enjoyed
this
frank
simplicity
he
professed
not
to
understand
and
begged
lemuel
to
explain
well
at
home
in
the
country
they
might
want
to
do
so
much
for
you
or
be
so
polite
about
it
but
they
would
feel
themselves
so
much
above
you
they
more
on
an
equality
if
i
needed
help
i
rather
be
in
town
but
if
i
could
help
myself
i
just
as
soon
be
in
the
country
only
he
added
there
are
more
chances
yes
there
more
chances
and
do
you
think
it
better
not
to
be
quite
so
kind
and
to
be
more
on
an
equality
why
do
you
demanded
lemuel
well
i
do
know
said
evans
with
a
whimsical
affection
of
seriousness
should
you
like
an
aristocracy
if
you
could
be
one
of
the
aristocrats
do
you
think
you
opposed
to
aristocracy
because
you
do
want
to
be
under
i
have
spoken
to
be
a
duke
when
we
get
an
order
of
nobility
and
i
find
that
it
a
great
relief
i
do
feel
obliged
to
go
in
for
equality
nearly
as
much
as
i
lemuel
shyly
dropped
the
subject
not
feeling
himself
able
to
cope
with
his
elder
in
these
railleries
he
always
felt
his
heaviness
and
clumsiness
in
talking
with
the
editor
who
fascinated
him
he
did
not
know
but
he
had
said
too
much
about
city
people
being
aristocratic
it
was
not
quite
what
he
meant
he
had
really
been
thinking
of
miss
carver
and
how
proud
she
was
when
he
said
it
lately
he
had
seemed
to
see
a
difference
between
himself
and
other
people
and
he
had
begun
to
look
for
it
everywhere
though
when
he
spoke
to
evans
he
was
not
aware
how
strongly
the
poison
was
working
in
him
it
was
as
if
the
girl
had
made
that
difference
she
made
it
again
whatever
it
was
between
herself
and
the
black
man
who
once
brought
her
a
note
and
a
bunch
of
flowers
from
one
of
her
young
lady
pupils
she
was
very
polite
to
him
trying
to
put
him
at
ease
just
as
she
had
been
with
lemuel
that
night
if
he
came
into
the
to
seat
a
transient
when
miss
carver
was
there
he
knew
that
she
was
mentally
making
a
difference
between
him
and
the
boarders
the
ladies
all
had
the
custom
of
bidding
him
good
morning
when
they
came
in
to
breakfast
and
they
all
smiled
upon
him
except
miss
carver
she
seemed
every
morning
as
if
more
surprised
to
see
him
standing
there
at
the
door
and
showing
people
to
their
places
she
looked
puzzled
and
sometimes
she
blushed
as
if
she
were
ashamed
for
him
he
had
discovered
in
fine
that
there
were
sorts
of
honest
work
in
the
world
which
one
must
not
do
if
he
would
keep
his
through
the
consideration
of
others
once
all
work
had
been
work
but
now
he
had
found
that
there
was
work
which
was
service
and
that
service
was
dishonour
he
had
learned
that
the
people
who
did
this
work
were
as
a
class
apart
and
were
spoken
of
as
servants
with
slight
that
was
unconscious
or
conscious
but
never
absent
some
of
the
ladies
at
the
albans
had
tried
to
argue
with
lemuel
about
his
not
taking
the
fees
he
refused
and
he
knew
that
they
talked
him
over
one
day
when
he
was
showing
a
room
to
a
transient
he
heard
one
of
them
say
to
another
in
the
next
apartment
well
i
did
hate
to
offer
it
to
him
just
as
if
he
was
a
common
servant
and
the
other
said
well
i
do
see
what
he
can
expect
if
he
puts
himself
in
the
place
of
a
and
then
they
debated
together
whether
his
quality
of
clerk
was
sufficient
to
redeem
him
from
the
reproach
of
servitude
they
did
not
call
his
running
the
elevator
anything
because
a
clerk
might
do
that
in
a
casual
way
without
loss
of
dignity
they
alleged
other
cases
of
the
kind
his
inner
life
became
a
turmoil
of
suspicions
that
attached
themselves
to
every
word
spoken
to
him
by
those
who
must
think
themselves
above
him
he
could
see
now
how
far
behind
in
everything
willoughby
pastures
was
and
how
the
summer
folks
could
not
help
despising
the
people
that
took
them
to
board
and
waited
on
them
like
servants
in
cities
he
esteemed
the
boarders
at
the
albans
in
the
degree
that
he
thought
them
enlightened
enough
to
contemn
him
for
his
station
and
he
had
his
own
ideas
of
how
such
a
person
as
evans
really
felt
toward
him
he
felt
toward
him
and
was
interested
in
his
reading
as
a
person
might
feel
toward
and
be
interested
in
the
attainments
of
some
anomalous
animal
a
learned
pig
or
something
of
that
kind
he
could
look
back
now
on
his
life
at
miss
vane
and
see
that
he
was
treated
as
a
servant
there
a
petted
servant
but
still
a
servant
and
that
was
what
made
that
girl
behave
so
to
him
he
always
thought
of
sibyl
as
that
girl
he
would
have
thrown
up
his
place
at
once
though
he
knew
of
nothing
else
he
could
do
he
would
have
risked
starving
rather
than
keep
it
but
he
felt
that
it
was
of
no
use
that
the
stain
of
servitude
was
indelible
that
if
he
were
lifted
to
the
highest
station
it
would
not
redeem
him
in
miss
carver
eyes
all
this
time
he
had
scarcely
more
than
spoken
with
her
to
return
her
good
mornings
at
the
door
or
to
exchange
greetings
with
her
on
the
stairs
or
to
receive
some
charge
from
her
in
going
out
or
to
answer
some
question
of
hers
in
coming
in
as
to
whether
any
of
the
pupils
who
had
lessons
of
her
had
been
there
in
her
absence
he
made
these
interviews
as
brief
as
possible
he
was
as
stiff
and
cold
as
she
the
whose
full
name
was
alonzo
berry
had
one
joking
manner
for
all
manner
of
men
and
women
and
lemuel
suspicion
could
not
find
any
offensive
distinction
in
it
toward
himself
but
he
disabled
berry
own
gentility
for
that
reason
and
easily
learning
much
of
the
wild
past
in
the
west
from
so
eager
an
autobiographer
he
could
not
comfort
himself
with
his
friendship
while
the
student
poured
out
his
autobiography
without
stint
upon
lemuel
his
shyness
only
deepened
upon
the
boy
there
were
things
in
his
life
for
which
he
was
in
equal
fear
of
discovery
his
arrest
and
trial
in
the
police
court
his
mother
queerness
and
his
servile
condition
at
miss
vane
the
thought
that
sewell
knew
about
them
all
made
him
sometimes
hate
the
minister
till
he
reflected
that
he
had
evidently
told
no
one
of
them
but
he
was
always
trembling
lest
they
should
somehow
become
known
at
the
albans
and
when
berry
was
going
on
about
himself
his
exploits
his
escapes
his
loves
chiefly
his
loves
lemuel
soul
was
sealed
within
him
a
vision
of
his
disgraces
filled
him
with
horror
but
in
the
delight
of
talking
about
himself
berry
was
apparently
unaware
that
lemuel
had
not
reciprocated
his
confidences
he
celebrated
his
familiarity
with
miss
swan
and
her
friend
though
no
doubt
he
had
the
greater
share
of
the
acquaintance
that
was
apt
to
be
the
case
with
him
and
from
time
to
time
he
urged
lemuel
to
come
up
and
call
on
them
with
him
i
guess
they
do
want
to
call
said
lemuel
with
feeble
bitterness
at
last
one
evening
after
an
elaborate
argument
from
berry
to
prove
that
lemuel
had
the
time
and
that
he
just
knew
they
would
be
glad
to
see
him
why
demanded
berry
and
he
tried
to
get
lemuel
reason
but
when
lemuel
had
stated
that
belief
he
could
not
have
given
the
reason
for
it
on
his
berry
gave
the
conundrum
up
for
the
time
but
he
did
not
give
lemuel
up
he
had
an
increasing
need
of
him
as
he
advanced
in
a
passion
for
miss
swan
which
as
he
frankly
prophesied
was
bound
to
bring
him
to
the
sooner
or
later
he
debated
with
himself
in
lemuel
presence
all
the
best
form
of
popping
and
he
said
that
it
was
simply
worth
a
ranch
to
be
able
to
sing
to
him
she
a
darling
she
a
daisy
she
a
dumpling
she
a
lamb
and
to
feel
that
he
knew
who
was
he
usually
sang
this
refrain
to
lemuel
when
he
came
in
late
at
night
after
a
little
supper
with
some
of
the
fellows
that
had
left
traces
of
its
cheer
on
his
bated
breath
once
he
came
downstairs
alone
in
the
elevator
in
his
and
for
the
purpose
of
singing
it
after
lemuel
had
thought
him
in
bed
every
sunday
afternoon
during
the
winter
lemuel
went
to
see
statira
and
sometimes
in
the
evening
he
took
her
to
church
but
she
could
not
understand
why
he
always
wanted
to
go
to
a
different
church
she
did
not
see
why
he
should
not
pick
out
one
church
and
stick
to
it
the
ministers
seemed
to
be
all
alike
and
she
guessed
one
was
pretty
near
as
good
as
another
grier
said
she
guessed
they
were
all
lemuel
to
her
and
statira
said
well
she
guessed
that
was
pretty
much
so
she
no
longer
pretended
that
he
was
not
the
whole
world
to
her
either
with
him
or
with
grier
she
was
so
happy
from
morning
till
night
day
in
and
day
out
that
grier
said
if
she
were
in
her
place
she
should
be
afraid
something
would
happen
statira
worked
in
the
now
she
liked
it
a
great
deal
better
than
the
store
and
declared
that
she
was
ever
so
much
stronger
the
cough
lingered
still
but
none
of
them
noticed
it
much
she
called
it
a
cold
and
said
she
kept
catching
more
grier
told
her
that
she
could
throw
it
off
soon
enough
if
she
would
buy
a
few
clothes
for
warmth
and
not
so
many
for
looks
but
they
did
not
talk
this
over
before
lemuel
before
he
came
statira
took
a
soothing
mixture
that
she
got
of
the
apothecary
and
then
they
were
all
as
bright
and
gay
as
could
be
and
she
looked
so
pretty
that
he
said
he
could
not
get
used
to
it
the
housekeeping
experiment
was
a
great
success
she
and
grier
had
two
rooms
now
and
they
lived
better
than
ever
they
had
for
less
money
of
course
statira
said
it
was
not
up
to
the
albans
which
lemuel
had
told
them
of
at
first
a
little
braggingly
in
fact
she
liked
to
have
him
brag
of
it
and
of
the
splendours
of
his
position
and
surroundings
she
was
very
curious
but
not
envious
of
anything
and
it
became
a
joke
with
her
and
grier
who
pretended
to
despise
the
whole
affair
at
first
it
flattered
lemuel
to
have
her
admire
his
rise
in
life
so
simply
and
ardently
but
after
a
while
it
became
embarrassing
in
proportion
as
it
no
longer
seemed
so
superb
to
him
she
was
always
wanting
him
to
talk
of
it
after
a
few
sundays
with
the
long
hours
they
had
passed
in
telling
each
other
all
they
could
think
of
about
themselves
they
had
not
much
else
to
talk
of
now
that
she
had
him
to
employ
her
fancy
statira
no
longer
fed
it
on
the
novels
she
used
to
devour
he
brought
her
books
but
she
did
not
read
them
she
said
that
she
had
been
so
busy
with
her
sewing
she
had
no
time
to
read
and
every
week
she
showed
him
some
pretty
new
thing
she
had
been
making
and
tried
it
on
for
him
to
see
how
she
looked
in
it
often
she
seemed
to
care
more
to
rest
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
not
talk
at
all
and
for
a
while
this
was
enough
for
him
too
though
sometimes
he
was
disappointed
that
she
did
not
even
let
him
read
to
her
out
of
the
books
she
neglected
she
would
not
talk
over
the
sermons
they
heard
together
but
once
when
evans
offered
him
tickets
for
the
theatre
and
lemuel
had
got
the
night
off
and
taken
statira
it
seemed
as
if
she
would
be
willing
to
sit
up
till
morning
and
talk
the
play
over
nothing
else
ever
interested
her
so
much
except
what
one
of
the
girls
in
the
had
told
her
about
going
down
to
the
beach
summers
and
waiting
on
table
this
girl
had
been
at
old
orchard
where
they
had
splendid
times
with
one
veranda
all
to
themselves
and
the
and
in
the
afternoon
the
girls
got
together
on
the
beach
or
the
grass
right
in
front
of
the
hotel
and
sewed
they
got
nearly
as
much
as
they
did
in
the
and
then
the
boarders
all
gave
you
something
extra
some
of
them
gave
as
much
as
a
dollar
a
week
apiece
the
was
a
college
student
and
a
perfect
gentleman
he
was
always
dressed
up
in
a
and
a
white
silk
statira
said
that
next
summer
she
wanted
they
should
go
off
somewhere
she
and
grier
and
wait
on
table
together
and
she
knew
lemuel
could
easily
get
the
place
after
the
albans
she
should
not
want
he
should
be
clerk
because
then
they
could
not
have
such
good
times
for
they
would
be
more
separated
lemuel
heard
her
restively
through
and
then
broke
out
fiercely
and
told
her
that
he
had
seen
enough
of
waiting
on
table
at
the
albans
for
him
never
to
want
her
to
do
it
and
that
the
boarders
who
gave
money
to
the
waiters
despised
them
for
taking
it
he
said
that
he
did
not
consider
just
helping
harmon
out
the
same
as
being
and
that
he
would
not
be
a
regular
waiter
for
any
money
he
would
rather
starve
statira
did
not
understand
she
asked
him
meekly
if
he
were
mad
at
her
he
seemed
so
and
he
had
to
do
what
he
could
to
cheer
her
up
grier
took
statira
part
pretty
sharply
she
said
it
was
one
thing
to
live
out
in
a
private
family
that
a
disgrace
if
you
could
keep
the
breath
of
life
in
you
any
other
way
and
it
was
quite
another
to
wait
in
an
hotel
and
she
did
not
want
to
have
any
one
hint
round
that
she
would
let
statira
demean
herself
lemuel
was
offended
by
her
manner
and
her
assumption
of
owning
statira
she
defended
him
but
he
could
not
tell
her
how
he
had
changed
the
influences
were
perhaps
too
obscure
for
him
to
have
traced
them
all
himself
after
the
first
time
he
had
hardly
mentioned
the
girls
to
her
there
were
a
great
many
things
that
statira
could
not
understand
she
had
been
much
longer
in
the
city
than
lemuel
but
she
did
not
seem
to
appreciate
the
difference
between
that
and
the
country
she
dressed
very
stylishly
no
one
went
beyond
her
in
that
but
in
many
things
he
could
see
that
she
remained
countrified
once
on
a
very
mild
april
evening
when
they
were
passing
through
the
public
garden
she
wished
him
to
sit
on
a
vacant
seat
they
came
to
all
the
others
were
occupied
by
young
couples
who
sat
with
their
arms
around
each
other
no
no
shuddered
lemuel
i
do
want
people
should
take
you
for
one
of
these
why
lem
how
proud
you
getting
she
cried
with
easy
acquiescence
you
awfully
stuck
up
well
then
you
got
to
take
a
i
ca
walk
any
xix
lemuel
had
found
out
about
the
from
berry
he
said
they
were
no
relation
to
each
other
and
had
not
even
been
acquainted
before
they
met
at
the
he
had
first
met
them
at
the
albans
miss
swan
was
from
the
western
part
of
the
state
and
miss
carver
from
down
plymouth
way
the
latter
took
pupils
and
sometimes
gave
lessons
at
their
houses
she
was
to
berry
thinking
not
half
the
genius
and
not
half
the
duck
that
miss
swan
was
though
she
was
a
duck
in
her
way
too
miss
swan
as
nearly
as
he
could
explain
was
studying
art
for
the
fun
of
it
or
the
excitement
for
she
was
well
enough
off
her
father
was
a
lawyer
out
there
and
berry
believed
that
a
rising
in
his
own
profession
would
be
just
the
thing
for
the
old
man
declining
years
he
said
he
should
not
be
very
particular
about
settling
down
to
practice
at
once
if
his
wife
wanted
to
go
to
europe
a
while
and
kind
of
tender
foot
it
round
for
a
year
or
two
in
the
over
there
he
would
let
the
old
man
run
the
business
a
little
longer
sometimes
it
did
an
old
man
good
there
was
no
hurry
berry
own
father
was
not
excited
about
his
going
to
work
right
away
he
had
the
money
to
run
berry
and
a
wife
too
if
it
came
to
that
miss
swan
understood
that
he
had
not
told
her
so
in
just
so
many
words
but
he
had
let
her
know
that
alonzo
berry
senior
was
not
borrowing
money
at
two
per
cent
a
month
any
more
he
said
he
did
not
care
to
make
much
of
a
blow
about
that
part
of
it
till
he
was
ready
to
act
and
he
was
not
going
to
act
till
he
had
a
thing
of
it
he
was
having
a
very
good
time
as
it
went
along
and
he
guessed
miss
swan
was
too
no
use
to
hurry
a
girl
when
she
was
on
the
right
track
berry
invented
these
axioms
apparently
to
put
himself
in
heart
in
the
abstract
he
was
already
courageous
enough
he
said
that
these
eastern
girls
were
not
used
to
having
any
sort
of
attention
that
there
was
only
about
a
tenth
or
fifteenth
of
a
fellow
to
every
girl
and
that
it
tickled
one
of
them
to
death
to
have
a
whole
man
around
he
was
not
meanly
exultant
at
their
destitution
he
said
he
just
wished
one
of
these
pretty
boston
girls
nice
well
dressed
cultured
and
brought
up
to
be
snubbed
and
neglected
by
the
tenths
and
fifteenths
of
men
they
had
at
home
could
be
let
loose
in
the
west
and
have
a
regular
of
fellows
or
no
he
would
like
to
have
about
five
thousand
fellows
from
out
there
that
never
expected
a
woman
to
look
at
them
unloaded
in
boston
and
see
them
open
their
eyes
would
one
of
get
home
alive
if
kindness
could
kill
i
never
saw
such
a
place
i
ca
get
used
to
it
it
makes
me
tired
sort
of
fellow
could
get
married
in
boston
berry
made
no
attempt
to
reconcile
his
uncertainty
as
to
his
own
chances
with
this
general
theory
but
he
urged
it
to
prove
that
miss
swan
and
miss
carver
would
like
to
have
lemuel
call
he
said
they
had
both
said
they
wished
they
could
paint
him
he
had
himself
sustained
various
characters
in
costume
for
them
and
one
night
he
pretended
that
they
had
sent
him
down
for
lemuel
to
help
out
with
a
certain
group
but
they
received
him
with
a
sort
of
blankness
which
convinced
him
that
berry
had
exceeded
his
authority
there
was
a
helplessness
at
first
and
then
an
indignant
determination
to
save
him
from
a
false
position
even
at
their
own
cost
which
lemuel
felt
rather
than
saw
miss
carver
was
foremost
in
his
rescue
she
devoted
herself
to
this
and
left
miss
swan
to
punish
berry
who
conveyed
from
time
to
time
his
sense
that
he
was
getting
it
by
a
wink
to
lemuel
an
observer
with
more
social
light
might
have
been
more
puzzled
to
account
for
berry
toleration
by
these
girls
who
apparently
associated
with
him
on
equal
terms
since
he
was
not
a
servant
he
their
equal
in
lemuel
eyes
perhaps
his
acceptance
might
otherwise
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
he
was
very
amusing
chivalrously
harmless
and
extremely
and
useful
to
them
one
must
not
leave
out
of
the
reckoning
his
open
devotion
for
miss
swan
which
in
itself
would
do
much
to
approve
him
to
her
and
commend
him
to
miss
carver
if
she
were
a
generous
girl
and
very
fond
of
her
friend
it
is
certain
that
they
did
tolerate
berry
who
made
them
laugh
even
that
night
in
spite
of
themselves
till
miss
swan
said
well
what
the
use
and
stopped
trying
to
discipline
him
after
that
they
had
a
very
sociable
evening
though
lemuel
kept
his
distance
and
would
not
let
them
include
him
knowing
what
the
two
girls
really
thought
of
him
he
would
not
take
part
in
berry
buffooneries
but
talked
soberly
and
rather
austerely
with
miss
carver
and
to
show
that
he
did
not
feel
himself
an
inferior
whatever
she
might
think
he
was
very
sarcastic
about
some
of
the
city
ways
and
customs
they
spoke
of
there
were
a
good
many
books
about
novels
mostly
but
not
the
kind
statira
used
to
read
and
poems
miss
carver
said
she
liked
to
take
them
up
when
she
was
nervous
from
her
work
and
if
the
weather
was
bad
and
she
could
not
get
out
for
a
walk
a
book
seemed
to
do
her
almost
as
much
good
nearly
all
the
pictures
about
in
the
room
seemed
to
be
miss
swan
in
fact
when
lemuel
asked
about
them
and
tried
to
praise
them
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
show
his
ignorance
miss
carver
said
she
did
very
little
in
colour
her
lessons
were
all
in
black
and
white
he
would
not
let
her
see
that
he
did
not
know
what
this
was
but
he
was
ashamed
and
he
determined
to
find
out
he
determined
to
get
a
and
learn
something
about
it
himself
to
his
thinking
the
room
was
pretty
there
were
shawls
hung
upon
the
walls
and
rugs
and
pieces
of
cloth
which
sometimes
had
paintings
fastened
to
them
there
were
paintings
standing
round
the
room
on
the
floor
sometimes
right
side
out
and
sometimes
faced
to
the
walls
there
were
two
or
three
fleeces
and
scattered
about
instead
of
a
carpet
and
there
were
two
easels
and
stands
with
paints
all
twisted
up
in
lead
tubes
on
them
he
compared
the
room
with
statira
and
did
not
think
much
of
it
at
first
afterwards
it
did
not
seem
so
bad
he
began
to
feel
its
picturesqueness
for
he
went
there
again
and
let
the
girls
sketch
him
when
miss
swan
asked
him
that
night
if
he
would
let
them
he
wished
to
refuse
but
she
seemed
so
modest
about
it
and
made
it
such
a
great
favour
on
his
part
that
he
consented
she
said
she
merely
wished
to
make
a
little
sketch
in
colour
and
miss
carver
a
little
study
of
his
head
in
black
and
white
and
he
imagined
it
a
trifling
affair
that
could
be
despatched
in
a
single
night
they
decided
to
treat
his
head
as
a
young
roman
head
and
at
the
end
of
a
long
sitting
beguiled
with
talk
and
with
thoughtful
voluntaries
from
berry
on
his
banjo
he
found
that
miss
carver
had
rubbed
her
study
nearly
all
out
with
a
piece
of
bread
and
miss
swan
said
she
should
want
to
try
a
perfectly
new
sketch
with
the
shoulders
draped
the
coat
had
confused
her
she
would
not
let
any
one
see
what
she
had
done
though
berry
tried
to
make
her
let
him
lemuel
looked
a
little
blank
when
she
asked
him
for
another
sitting
but
berry
said
oh
you
have
to
come
barker
penalty
of
greatness
you
know
have
you
in
williams
everett
window
notices
in
all
the
papers
exquisite
studies
by
miss
swan
and
miss
carver
of
the
head
of
the
gentlemanly
and
accommodating
clerk
of
the
albans
as
a
roman
youth
chromoed
as
a
christmas
card
by
prang
and
photograph
copies
everywhere
you
all
right
one
night
miss
swan
said
in
rapture
with
some
momentary
success
oh
i
perfectly
in
love
with
this
head
berry
looked
up
from
his
banjo
which
he
ceased
to
strum
hello
hello
then
the
two
broke
into
a
laugh
in
which
lemuel
helplessly
joined
what
what
is
it
asked
miss
carver
looking
up
absently
from
her
work
nothing
just
a
little
outburst
of
passion
from
our
young
friend
here
said
berry
nodding
his
head
toward
miss
swan
what
does
it
mean
mad
asked
miss
carver
in
the
same
dreamy
way
continuing
her
work
yes
madeline
said
berry
explain
mr
berry
cried
miss
swan
warningly
that
me
alonzo
go
on
you
forget
yourself
said
the
girl
with
imperfect
severity
well
you
forgot
me
first
said
berry
with
affected
injury
ai
it
hard
enough
to
sit
here
night
after
night
strumming
on
the
old
banjo
while
another
fellow
is
going
down
to
posterity
as
a
roman
youth
with
a
red
shawl
round
his
neck
without
having
to
hear
people
say
they
in
love
with
that
head
of
his
miss
carver
now
stopped
her
work
and
looked
from
her
friend
with
her
head
bowed
in
laughter
on
the
back
of
her
hand
to
that
of
berry
bent
in
burlesque
reproach
upon
her
and
then
at
lemuel
who
was
trying
to
control
himself
but
i
can
tell
you
what
miss
swan
you
spoke
too
late
as
the
man
said
when
he
swallowed
the
chicken
in
the
fresh
egg
barker
has
a
previous
engagement
that
so
barker
lemuel
turned
and
looked
round
at
miss
carver
who
met
his
glance
with
her
clear
gaze
she
turned
presently
to
make
some
comment
on
miss
swan
sketch
and
then
after
working
a
little
while
longer
she
said
she
was
tired
and
was
going
to
make
some
tea
the
girls
both
pressed
lemuel
to
stay
for
a
cup
but
he
would
not
and
berry
followed
him
downstairs
to
explain
and
apologise
it
all
right
said
lemuel
what
difference
would
it
make
to
them
whether
i
was
engaged
or
not
well
i
suppose
as
a
general
rule
a
girl
would
rather
a
fellow
was
philosophised
berry
he
whistled
ruefully
and
lemuel
drawing
a
book
toward
him
in
continued
silence
he
rose
from
the
seat
he
had
taken
on
the
desk
in
the
little
office
and
said
well
i
guess
it
all
come
out
right
come
to
think
of
it
do
know
anything
about
your
affairs
and
i
can
tell
oh
it
do
he
had
pulled
the
book
toward
him
as
if
he
were
going
to
read
but
he
could
not
read
his
head
was
in
a
whirl
after
a
first
frenzy
of
resentment
against
berry
he
was
now
angry
at
himself
for
having
been
so
embarrassed
he
thought
of
a
retort
that
would
have
passed
it
all
off
lightly
then
he
reflected
again
that
it
was
of
no
consequence
to
these
young
ladies
whether
he
was
engaged
or
not
and
at
any
rate
it
was
nobody
business
but
his
own
of
course
he
was
engaged
to
statira
but
he
had
hardly
thought
of
it
in
that
way
grier
had
joked
about
the
time
when
she
supposed
she
should
have
to
keep
old
maid
hall
alone
when
she
first
did
this
lemuel
thought
it
delightful
but
afterwards
he
did
not
like
it
so
much
it
began
to
annoy
him
that
grier
should
mix
herself
up
so
much
with
statira
and
himself
he
believed
that
statira
would
be
different
would
be
more
like
other
ladies
he
generalised
it
in
this
way
but
he
meant
miss
swan
and
miss
carver
if
she
had
not
grier
there
all
the
time
to
keep
her
back
he
convinced
himself
that
if
it
were
not
for
grier
he
should
have
had
no
trouble
in
telling
statira
that
the
were
sketching
him
and
that
he
had
not
done
so
yet
because
he
hated
to
have
ask
her
so
much
about
them
and
call
them
that
swan
girl
and
that
carver
girl
as
she
would
be
sure
to
do
and
clip
away
the
whole
evening
with
her
questions
and
her
guesses
it
was
now
nearly
a
fortnight
since
the
sketching
began
and
he
had
let
one
sunday
night
pass
without
mentioning
it
he
could
not
let
another
pass
and
he
knew
grier
would
say
they
were
a
good
while
about
it
and
would
show
her
ignorance
and
put
statira
up
to
asking
all
sorts
of
things
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
it
and
he
let
the
next
sunday
night
pass
without
saying
anything
to
statira
the
sittings
continued
but
before
the
third
sunday
came
miss
swan
said
she
did
not
see
how
she
could
do
anything
more
to
her
sketch
and
miss
carver
had
already
completed
her
study
they
criticised
each
other
work
with
freedom
and
good
humour
and
agreed
that
the
next
thing
was
to
paint
it
out
and
rub
it
out
no
said
berry
what
you
want
is
a
fresh
eye
on
it
i
worried
over
it
as
much
as
you
have
suffered
more
i
believe
and
barker
tell
whether
he
looks
like
a
roman
youth
or
not
why
do
you
have
up
old
evans
miss
swan
took
no
apparent
notice
of
this
suggestion
and
miss
carver
who
left
berry
snubbing
entirely
to
her
said
nothing
after
a
minute
study
of
the
pictures
miss
swan
suggested
if
barker
had
any
friends
he
would
like
to
show
them
to
oh
no
thank
you
returned
lemuel
hastily
there
is
anybody
and
again
he
found
himself
turning
very
red
well
i
do
know
how
we
can
thank
you
enough
for
your
patience
barker
said
the
girl
oh
do
mention
it
i
i
enjoyed
it
said
lemuel
game
every
time
said
berry
and
their
evening
broke
up
with
a
laugh
the
next
morning
lemuel
stopped
miss
swan
at
the
door
of
the
breakfast
room
and
said
i
been
thinking
over
what
you
said
last
night
and
i
like
to
bring
some
one
a
lady
friend
of
mine
to
see
the
why
certainly
barker
any
time
some
evening
she
suggested
should
you
mind
it
if
i
came
night
he
asked
and
he
thought
it
right
to
remind
her
it
sunday
oh
not
at
all
night
by
all
means
we
shall
both
be
at
home
and
very
glad
to
see
she
hurried
after
miss
carver
loitering
on
her
way
to
their
table
and
lemuel
saw
them
put
their
heads
together
as
if
they
were
whispering
he
knew
they
were
whispering
about
him
but
they
did
not
laugh
probably
they
kept
themselves
from
laughing
in
coming
out
from
breakfast
miss
swan
said
i
hope
your
friend
is
critical
barker
and
he
answered
confusedly
oh
not
at
all
thank
but
he
said
to
himself
that
he
did
not
care
whether
she
was
trying
to
make
fun
of
him
or
not
he
knew
what
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
do
statira
did
not
seem
to
care
much
about
going
to
see
the
pictures
when
he
proposed
it
to
her
the
next
evening
she
asked
why
he
had
been
keeping
it
such
a
great
secret
and
he
could
not
pretend
as
he
had
once
thought
he
could
that
he
was
keeping
it
as
a
surprise
for
her
should
like
to
see
she
asked
with
languid
indifference
i
d
know
as
i
care
much
about
lem
picture
we
got
around
grier
whipped
out
but
i
like
t
see
those
celebrated
girls
we
heard
s
much
well
said
statira
carelessly
and
they
went
into
the
next
room
to
put
on
their
wraps
lemuel
vexed
to
have
grier
made
one
of
the
party
and
helpless
to
prevent
her
going
walked
up
and
down
wondering
what
he
should
say
when
he
arrived
with
this
unexpected
guest
but
miss
swan
received
both
of
the
girls
very
politely
and
chatted
with
grier
whose
conversation
in
defiance
of
any
sense
of
superiority
that
the
swan
girl
or
the
carver
girl
might
feel
was
a
succession
of
laconic
snaps
sometimes
witty
but
mostly
rude
and
contradictory
miss
carver
made
tea
and
served
it
in
some
pretty
cups
which
lemuel
hoped
statira
might
admire
but
she
took
it
without
noticing
and
in
talking
with
miss
carver
she
drawled
and
said
and
i
do
know
as
i
and
well
i
should
think
as
with
a
prolongation
of
all
the
final
syllables
in
her
sentences
which
he
had
not
observed
in
her
before
and
which
she
must
have
borrowed
for
the
occasion
for
the
gentility
of
the
effect
she
tried
to
refer
everything
to
him
and
she
and
grier
talked
together
as
much
as
they
could
and
when
the
others
spoke
of
him
as
barker
they
called
him
lem
they
did
not
look
at
anything
or
do
anything
to
betray
that
they
found
the
studio
on
which
lemuel
had
once
expatiated
to
them
different
from
other
rooms
at
last
miss
swan
abruptly
brought
out
the
studies
of
lemuel
head
and
put
them
in
a
good
light
grier
and
statira
got
into
the
wrong
place
to
see
them
blurted
out
well
he
looks
if
he
had
a
fit
of
sickness
in
one
and
perhaps
in
fact
miss
carver
had
refined
too
much
upon
a
delicate
ideal
of
lemuel
looks
so
he
drawled
statira
and
how
funny
he
looks
with
that
red
thing
miss
swan
explained
that
she
had
thrown
that
in
for
the
colour
and
that
they
had
been
fancying
him
in
the
character
of
a
young
roman
you
think
he
got
a
roman
asked
statira
through
her
own
i
think
lem
got
a
kind
of
a
pug
said
grier
well
grier
said
statira
lemuel
could
not
look
at
miss
carver
whom
he
knew
to
be
gazing
at
the
two
girls
from
the
little
distance
to
which
she
had
withdrawn
miss
swan
was
biting
her
lip
so
that
the
celebrated
albans
is
it
said
grier
when
they
got
in
the
street
do
know
i
really
ever
expected
to
see
the
inside
it
you
notice
the
kind
of
oilcloth
they
had
on
that
upper
entry
they
did
not
mention
lemuel
pictures
or
the
artists
and
he
scarcely
spoke
on
the
way
home
when
they
parted
statira
broke
out
crying
and
would
not
let
him
kiss
her
xx
i
afraid
your
little
friend
at
the
albans
is
altogether
happy
of
late
said
evans
toward
the
end
of
what
he
called
one
of
his
powwows
with
sewell
their
talk
had
taken
a
vaster
range
than
usual
and
they
both
felt
the
need
that
people
know
in
dealing
with
abstractions
of
finally
getting
the
ground
beneath
their
feet
again
ah
asked
sewell
with
a
twinge
that
allayed
his
satisfaction
in
this
what
the
matter
with
him
oh
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
i
i
hope
there
nothing
wrong
said
sewell
anxiously
oh
no
i
used
the
phrase
because
it
came
easily
just
what
i
mean
is
that
i
afraid
his
view
of
our
social
inequalities
is
widening
and
deepening
and
that
he
experiences
the
dissatisfaction
of
people
who
do
command
that
prospect
from
the
summit
i
told
you
of
his
censure
of
our
aristocratic
constitution
yes
said
sewell
with
a
smile
well
i
afraid
he
feels
it
more
and
more
if
i
can
judge
from
the
occasional
distance
and
with
which
he
treats
me
he
is
humiliated
by
it
nothing
makes
a
man
so
proud
as
humiliation
you
that
true
there
are
a
couple
of
pretty
girls
at
the
albans
who
have
been
painting
barker
so
i
learn
from
a
reformed
of
the
plains
who
is
with
us
as
a
and
is
about
with
one
of
the
young
ladies
a
good
deal
they
rather
nice
girls
quite
nice
in
fact
and
there
no
harm
in
the
and
a
good
deal
of
fun
but
if
barker
had
conceived
of
being
painted
as
a
social
inferior
and
had
been
made
to
feel
that
he
was
merely
a
model
and
if
he
had
become
at
all
aware
that
one
of
the
girls
was
rather
pretty
they
both
are
i
see
i
do
say
it
so
but
he
seems
why
do
you
come
round
and
cheer
him
up
get
into
his
confidence
get
into
the
centre
of
the
earth
cried
sewell
i
never
saw
such
an
inapproachable
creature
evans
laughed
he
rather
remote
the
genuine
american
youth
is
apt
to
be
so
especially
if
he
thinks
you
mean
him
a
kindness
but
there
ought
to
be
some
way
of
convincing
him
that
he
need
not
feel
any
ignominy
in
his
employment
after
so
many
centuries
of
christianity
and
generations
of
democracy
it
ought
to
be
very
simple
to
convince
him
that
there
is
nothing
disgraceful
in
showing
people
to
their
places
at
it
is
said
the
minister
soberly
no
it
is
said
evans
i
wonder
he
added
thoughtfully
why
we
despise
certain
occupations
we
do
despise
a
man
who
hammers
stone
or
saws
boards
why
should
we
despise
a
barber
is
the
care
of
the
human
head
intrinsically
less
honourable
than
the
shaping
of
such
rude
material
why
do
we
still
condemn
the
tailor
who
clothes
us
and
honour
the
painter
who
portrays
us
in
the
same
clothes
why
do
we
despise
waiters
i
tried
to
make
barker
believe
that
i
respected
all
kinds
of
honest
work
but
i
lied
i
despised
him
for
having
waited
on
table
why
have
all
manner
of
domestics
fallen
under
our
scorn
and
come
to
be
stigmatised
in
a
lump
as
servants
ah
i
do
know
said
the
minister
there
something
in
personal
attendance
upon
us
that
dishonours
but
the
reasons
of
it
are
very
obscure
could
give
them
perhaps
it
because
it
work
that
in
a
simpler
state
of
things
each
of
us
would
do
for
himself
and
in
this
state
is
too
proud
to
that
does
cover
the
whole
ground
said
evans
and
you
think
that
poor
boy
is
troubled
is
really
suffering
from
a
sense
of
inferiority
to
the
other
young
people
oh
i
do
say
certainly
perhaps
not
but
if
he
were
what
should
you
say
was
the
best
thing
for
him
to
do
remain
a
servant
cast
his
lot
with
these
outcasts
or
try
to
separate
and
distinguish
himself
from
them
as
we
all
do
come
we
live
in
the
world
which
is
so
bad
though
it
pretty
stupid
he
could
change
it
now
what
ought
he
to
do
sewell
mused
a
while
without
answering
anything
then
he
said
with
a
smile
it
very
much
simpler
to
fit
people
for
the
other
world
than
for
this
do
you
think
yes
it
is
it
was
a
cold
day
for
the
clergy
when
it
was
imagined
that
they
ought
to
do
well
said
sewell
rising
to
follow
his
friend
to
the
door
i
will
come
to
see
barker
and
try
to
talk
with
him
he
a
very
complicated
problem
i
supposed
that
i
had
merely
his
material
prosperity
to
provide
for
after
getting
him
down
here
but
if
i
have
to
reconcile
him
to
the
constitution
of
society
yes
said
evans
i
wish
you
let
me
know
the
result
of
your
labours
i
think
i
could
make
a
very
incisive
article
on
the
subject
the
topic
is
always
an
attractive
one
there
is
nobody
who
does
feel
that
somebody
else
is
taking
on
airs
with
him
and
ought
to
have
his
comb
cut
or
if
you
should
happen
to
prove
to
barker
that
his
ignominy
is
in
accordance
with
the
development
theory
and
is
a
necessary
survival
or
something
of
that
sort
do
you
see
what
a
card
it
would
be
for
us
with
the
better
classes
they
went
downstairs
together
and
at
the
street
door
evans
stopped
again
or
i
tell
you
what
make
it
a
simple
study
of
mind
a
sort
of
psychological
interview
and
then
with
what
i
been
able
to
get
from
him
we
can
present
the
impression
that
boston
makes
upon
a
young
fresh
shrewd
mind
that
would
be
something
rather
new
would
it
come
the
would
make
it
worth
your
while
and
then
you
could
work
it
into
a
sermon
you
shameless
reprobate
said
sewell
laying
his
hand
affectionately
on
his
friend
arm
there
was
nothing
in
lemuel
case
that
seemed
to
him
urgent
and
he
did
not
go
to
see
him
at
once
in
the
meantime
fast
day
came
and
lemuel
got
away
at
last
to
pay
his
first
visit
home
seems
to
me
ye
ai
lookin
over
and
above
well
lem
was
the
first
thing
his
mother
said
to
him
even
before
she
noticed
how
well
he
was
dressed
his
new
spring
overcoat
another
prize
from
the
misfit
parlours
and
his
new
shoes
and
derby
hat
with
the
suit
of
clothes
he
had
kept
so
carefully
all
through
the
winter
were
not
the
complete
disguise
he
had
fancied
they
might
be
at
willoughby
pastures
the
had
known
him
as
soon
as
he
got
out
of
the
cars
and
ignored
his
splendour
in
recognising
him
he
said
hello
lem
and
had
not
time
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
boy
changed
appearance
before
lemuel
hurried
away
with
the
bag
he
had
bought
so
long
before
for
the
visit
he
met
several
people
on
his
way
home
from
the
depot
two
of
them
were
women
and
one
of
these
said
she
knew
as
soon
as
she
looked
at
him
who
it
was
and
the
other
said
she
should
have
known
it
was
lem
barker
as
far
as
she
could
see
him
she
asked
him
if
he
was
home
for
good
now
his
mother
pushed
back
his
thick
hair
with
her
hard
old
hand
as
she
spoke
to
him
and
then
she
pressed
his
head
down
upon
her
neck
which
was
mostly
but
lemuel
could
hear
her
heart
beat
and
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
oh
i
all
right
mother
he
said
huskily
though
he
tried
to
say
it
cheerfully
he
let
her
hold
his
head
there
the
longer
because
mixed
with
his
tenderness
for
her
was
a
horror
of
her
bloomers
which
he
was
not
at
once
able
to
overcome
when
he
gained
courage
to
look
he
saw
that
she
had
them
on
but
now
he
had
the
strength
to
bear
it
ye
had
any
breakfast
she
asked
and
when
he
said
that
he
had
got
a
cup
of
coffee
at
fitchburg
she
said
well
she
must
get
him
something
and
she
drew
him
a
cup
of
japan
tea
and
made
him
some
milk
toast
and
talking
all
the
time
and
telling
him
how
his
sister
and
her
husband
had
gone
to
the
village
to
have
one
of
her
teeth
drawn
they
had
got
along
through
the
winter
pretty
well
but
she
guessed
that
they
would
have
had
more
to
complain
of
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
this
was
her
way
of
acknowledging
the
help
lemuel
had
given
them
every
week
and
it
was
casually
sandwiched
between
an
account
of
an
indian
spirit
treatment
which
reuben
had
tried
for
his
rheumatism
and
a
question
whether
lemuel
had
seen
anything
of
that
mind
cure
down
to
boston
but
when
he
looked
about
the
room
and
saw
here
and
there
the
simple
comforts
and
necessaries
which
his
money
had
bought
the
sick
man
and
the
two
helpless
women
his
heart
swelled
with
joy
and
pride
and
he
realised
the
pleasure
we
all
feel
in
being
a
good
genius
at
times
it
had
come
pretty
hard
to
send
the
greater
part
of
his
week
wages
home
but
now
he
was
glad
he
had
done
it
the
poor
coarse
food
which
his
mother
had
served
him
as
a
treat
the
low
cracked
ceilings
the
waving
floor
covered
with
rag
carpet
the
sagging
doors
and
the
trim
of
the
windows
were
all
very
different
from
the
luxurious
abundance
the
tesselated
pavement
and
the
tapestry
brussels
the
lofty
studding
and
the
black
walnut
mouldings
of
the
albans
and
lemuel
felt
the
difference
with
a
curious
mixture
of
pride
and
remorse
in
his
own
escape
from
the
meanness
of
his
home
he
felt
the
to
which
the
man
who
rises
without
raising
with
him
all
those
dear
to
him
is
destined
in
some
measure
all
his
life
his
interests
and
associations
are
separated
from
theirs
but
if
he
is
not
an
ignoble
spirit
the
ties
of
affection
remain
unweakened
he
cares
for
them
with
a
kind
of
indignant
tenderness
and
calls
himself
to
account
before
them
in
the
midst
of
pleasures
which
they
can
not
share
or
even
imagine
lemuel
mother
did
not
ask
him
much
about
his
life
in
boston
she
had
not
the
materials
for
curiosity
about
it
but
he
told
her
everything
that
he
thought
she
could
understand
she
recurred
to
his
hopes
when
he
left
home
and
their
disappointment
in
sewell
and
she
asked
if
lemuel
ever
saw
him
nowadays
she
could
not
reconcile
herself
to
his
reconciliation
with
sewell
whom
she
still
held
to
have
behaved
treacherously
then
she
went
back
to
lemuel
looks
and
asked
him
if
he
kept
pretty
well
and
when
he
answered
that
he
did
she
smoothed
with
her
hand
the
knot
between
her
eyes
and
did
not
question
him
further
he
had
the
whole
forenoon
with
his
mother
and
he
helped
her
to
get
the
dinner
as
he
used
to
do
pulling
the
out
of
the
that
still
embedded
part
of
the
though
the
snow
was
all
gone
around
boston
it
was
thawing
under
the
dull
soft
april
sky
and
he
saw
the
first
bluebird
perched
on
the
when
he
went
out
for
the
wood
his
mother
said
there
had
been
lots
of
them
he
walked
about
the
place
and
into
the
barn
taking
in
the
forlornness
and
shabbiness
and
then
he
went
up
into
the
room
over
the
shed
where
he
used
to
study
and
write
his
heart
ached
with
he
realised
as
he
had
not
done
at
a
distance
how
dependent
this
wretched
home
was
upon
him
and
after
meaning
the
whole
morning
to
tell
his
mother
about
statira
he
decided
that
he
was
keeping
it
from
her
not
merely
because
he
was
ashamed
to
tell
her
that
he
was
engaged
but
because
it
seemed
such
a
crazy
thing
for
a
person
in
his
circumstances
if
it
was
really
an
engagement
he
had
not
seen
statira
since
that
night
when
he
brought
her
to
look
at
the
pictures
the
had
made
of
him
he
felt
that
he
had
not
parted
with
her
kindly
and
he
went
to
see
her
the
night
before
he
started
home
though
it
was
not
sunday
but
he
had
found
her
door
locked
and
this
made
him
angry
with
her
he
could
not
have
said
just
why
if
he
told
his
mother
about
statira
now
what
should
he
tell
her
he
compromised
by
telling
her
about
the
two
girls
that
had
painted
his
likeness
his
mother
seemed
not
to
care
a
great
deal
about
the
pictures
she
said
i
do
want
you
should
let
any
girl
make
a
fool
of
you
oh
no
he
answered
and
went
and
looked
out
of
the
window
i
do
say
but
what
they
nice
girls
enough
but
in
your
place
you
no
need
to
throw
yourself
lemuel
thought
of
the
awe
of
miss
carver
in
which
he
lived
and
the
difference
between
them
and
he
could
have
laughed
at
his
ignorant
pride
what
would
she
say
if
she
knew
that
he
was
engaged
to
a
girl
that
worked
in
a
but
probably
she
would
not
think
that
studying
art
and
teaching
it
was
any
better
she
evidently
believed
that
his
position
in
the
albans
was
superior
to
that
of
miss
carver
his
sister
and
her
husband
came
home
before
they
had
finished
dinner
his
sister
had
her
face
all
tied
up
to
keep
from
taking
cold
after
having
her
tooth
drawn
and
lemuel
had
to
go
out
and
help
his
rheumatic
put
up
the
horse
when
they
came
in
his
did
not
wash
his
hands
before
going
to
the
table
and
lemuel
could
not
keep
his
eyes
off
his
black
and
broken
fingernails
his
mother
and
sister
nails
were
black
too
it
must
have
been
so
when
he
lived
at
home
his
sister
could
not
eat
she
took
some
tea
and
went
to
bed
his
pulled
off
his
boots
after
dinner
and
put
up
his
on
the
to
warm
them
there
was
no
longer
any
chance
to
talk
with
his
mother
indoors
and
he
asked
her
if
she
would
not
like
to
come
out
it
was
very
mild
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
they
strolled
down
the
road
all
the
time
lemuel
had
to
keep
from
looking
at
her
bloomers
when
they
met
any
one
driving
he
had
to
keep
himself
from
trying
to
look
as
if
he
were
not
with
her
but
was
just
out
walking
alone
the
day
wore
heavily
away
his
rheumatism
came
on
toward
evening
and
his
sister
face
had
swollen
so
that
it
would
not
do
for
her
to
go
out
lemuel
put
on
some
old
clothes
he
found
in
his
room
and
milked
the
cows
himself
like
old
times
lem
said
his
mother
when
he
came
in
yes
he
assented
quietly
he
and
his
mother
had
tea
together
but
pretty
soon
afterwards
she
seemed
to
get
sleepy
and
lemuel
said
he
had
been
up
early
and
he
guessed
he
would
go
to
bed
his
mother
said
she
guessed
she
would
go
too
after
he
had
blown
out
his
light
she
came
in
to
see
if
he
were
comfortable
i
presume
it
seems
a
pretty
poor
place
to
you
lem
she
said
holding
her
lamp
up
and
looking
round
i
guess
if
it
good
enough
for
you
it
is
for
me
he
answered
evasively
no
it
ai
she
said
i
always
used
to
it
and
i
can
see
from
your
talk
that
you
got
used
to
something
different
already
well
it
right
lem
you
a
good
boy
and
i
want
you
should
get
the
good
of
boston
all
you
can
we
do
any
of
us
begrutch
it
to
ye
and
what
i
came
up
to
say
now
was
do
you
scrimp
yourself
down
there
to
send
home
to
us
we
got
a
roof
over
our
heads
and
we
can
keep
soul
and
body
together
somehow
we
always
have
and
we
do
need
a
great
deal
but
i
want
you
should
keep
yourself
nicely
dressed
down
to
boston
so
you
can
go
with
the
best
i
do
want
you
should
feel
anyways
meechin
on
account
of
your
clothes
you
got
a
good
figure
lem
you
take
after
your
father
sometimes
i
wish
you
was
a
little
bigger
but
and
he
had
a
big
spirit
he
afraid
of
anything
and
they
said
if
come
out
o
that
battle
where
he
was
killed
he
a
captain
he
was
a
good
she
had
hardly
ever
spoken
so
much
of
his
father
before
he
knew
now
by
the
sound
of
her
voice
in
the
dim
room
that
the
tears
must
be
in
her
eyes
but
she
governed
herself
and
went
on
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
do
you
keep
sendin
so
much
o
your
money
home
child
it
yours
and
i
want
you
should
have
it
most
of
it
goes
for
patent
medicines
anyway
when
it
gets
here
we
ca
keep
reuben
from
buying
and
he
always
changin
doctors
and
i
want
you
should
hold
yourself
high
lem
you
as
good
as
anybody
and
do
you
go
with
any
girls
especially
that
ai
of
the
best
you
gettin
to
that
time
o
life
when
you
begin
to
think
about
but
do
you
go
and
fall
in
love
with
the
first
little
poppet
you
see
because
she
got
pretty
eyes
and
curly
it
seemed
to
lemuel
as
if
she
must
know
about
statira
but
of
course
she
did
not
he
lay
still
and
she
went
on
do
you
go
and
get
engaged
or
any
such
foolishness
in
a
hurry
lem
them
girls
you
was
tellin
about
i
presume
they
all
right
enough
but
you
wait
a
while
young
men
think
it
a
kind
of
miracle
if
a
girl
likes
and
they
ready
to
go
crazy
over
it
but
it
the
most
natural
thing
she
can
do
you
just
wait
a
while
when
you
get
along
a
little
further
you
can
pick
and
choose
for
yourself
i
do
know
as
i
should
want
you
should
marry
for
money
but
do
you
go
and
take
up
with
the
first
thing
comes
along
because
you
afraid
to
look
higher
what
become
o
that
nasty
thing
that
talked
so
to
you
at
that
miss
vane
lemuel
said
that
he
had
never
seen
sibyl
or
miss
vane
since
but
he
did
not
make
any
direct
response
to
the
anxieties
his
mother
had
hinted
at
her
pride
in
him
so
ignorant
of
all
the
reality
of
his
life
in
the
city
crushed
him
more
than
the
sight
and
renewed
sense
of
the
mean
conditions
from
which
he
had
sprung
what
if
he
should
tell
her
that
miss
carver
whom
she
did
not
want
him
to
marry
in
a
hurry
regarded
him
as
a
servant
and
treated
him
as
she
would
treat
a
black
man
what
if
she
knew
that
he
was
as
good
as
engaged
to
marry
a
girl
that
could
no
more
meet
miss
carver
on
the
same
level
than
she
could
fly
he
could
only
tell
his
mother
not
to
feel
troubled
about
him
that
he
was
not
going
to
get
married
in
any
great
hurry
and
pretend
to
be
sleepy
and
turn
his
head
away
she
pulled
the
covering
up
round
his
neck
and
tucked
it
in
with
her
strong
rough
old
hand
whose
very
tenderness
hurt
he
had
expected
to
stay
the
greater
part
of
the
next
day
but
he
took
an
earlier
train
his
sister
was
still
laid
up
she
thought
she
must
have
taken
cold
in
her
jaw
her
husband
rumpled
unshaven
with
a
shawl
over
his
shoulders
cowered
about
the
for
the
heat
he
began
to
hate
this
poverty
and
suffering
to
long
for
escape
from
it
to
the
life
which
at
that
distance
seemed
so
rich
and
easy
and
pleasant
he
trembled
lest
something
might
have
happened
in
his
absence
to
have
thrown
him
out
of
his
place
all
the
way
to
boston
he
was
under
the
misery
of
the
home
that
he
was
leaving
his
mother
pride
added
to
the
burden
of
it
but
when
the
train
drew
in
sight
of
the
city
and
he
saw
the
steeples
and
chimneys
and
the
thin
masts
of
the
ships
printed
together
against
the
horizon
his
heart
rose
he
felt
equal
to
it
to
anything
in
it
he
arrived
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
he
saw
no
one
at
the
hotel
except
the
harmons
till
toward
then
the
ladies
coming
in
from
shopping
had
a
word
of
welcome
for
him
some
of
them
stopped
and
shook
hands
at
the
office
and
when
they
began
to
come
down
to
dinner
they
spoke
to
him
and
there
again
some
of
them
offered
their
hands
they
said
it
seemed
an
age
since
he
had
gone
the
came
down
with
berry
who
shook
hands
so
cordially
with
him
that
perhaps
they
could
not
help
it
miss
carver
seemed
to
hesitate
but
she
gave
him
her
hand
too
and
she
asked
as
the
others
had
done
whether
he
had
found
his
family
well
he
did
not
know
what
to
think
sometimes
he
felt
as
if
people
were
trying
to
make
a
fool
of
him
almost
he
remained
blushing
and
smiling
to
himself
after
the
last
of
them
had
gone
in
to
dinner
he
did
not
know
what
miss
carver
meant
but
her
eyes
seemed
to
have
lost
that
cold
distance
and
to
have
come
nearer
to
him
late
at
night
berry
came
to
him
where
he
sat
at
his
desk
well
barker
i
glad
you
back
again
old
man
feels
as
if
you
been
gone
a
month
of
sundays
did
know
whether
we
should
have
you
with
us
this
lemuel
grew
hot
with
consciousness
and
did
not
make
it
better
for
himself
by
saying
i
do
know
what
you
well
i
do
suppose
i
should
in
your
returned
berry
human
nature
it
all
right
what
did
the
ladies
think
of
the
youth
the
other
night
the
distinguished
artists
were
sure
exactly
and
i
thought
i
could
make
capital
with
one
of
if
i
could
find
out
yes
that
my
little
game
barker
that
what
i
dropped
in
for
bismarck
style
of
diplomacy
i
tell
you
why
they
want
to
know
if
you
wo
give
me
away
miss
swan
wanted
to
give
her
of
colour
what
she
calls
it
to
one
of
the
young
ladies
but
she
afraid
she
did
like
i
guess
they
liked
it
well
enough
said
lemuel
thinking
with
shame
that
statira
had
not
had
the
grace
to
say
a
word
of
either
of
the
pictures
he
attributed
this
to
grier
influence
well
that
good
so
far
as
it
goes
said
berry
but
now
to
come
down
to
particulars
what
did
they
that
what
miss
swan
will
ask
i
do
remember
just
what
they
said
faltered
lemuel
well
they
must
have
said
something
insisted
berry
jocosely
give
a
fellow
some
little
clue
and
i
can
piece
it
out
for
myself
what
did
say
i
do
ask
which
she
but
i
have
my
suspicions
all
i
want
to
know
is
what
she
anything
like
beautiful
middle
distance
or
splendid
chiaroscuro
or
fine
perspective
or
exquisite
modelling
come
now
try
to
think
he
gave
lemuel
time
but
to
no
purpose
well
he
resumed
with
affected
dejection
i
have
to
try
to
imagine
it
i
guess
i
can
i
have
worked
my
imagination
much
since
i
took
up
the
law
but
look
here
barker
he
continued
more
briskly
now
you
open
up
a
little
here
i
been
giving
you
my
confidence
ever
since
i
saw
you
forcing
it
on
you
and
you
know
just
how
far
i
gone
on
miss
swan
to
a
hundredth
part
of
an
inch
but
i
do
know
enough
of
your
affections
to
swear
that
you
got
any
now
which
one
is
it
do
be
mean
about
it
i
wo
give
you
away
honest
injun
lemuel
was
goaded
to
desperation
his
face
burned
and
the
perspiration
began
to
break
out
on
his
forehead
he
did
not
know
how
to
escape
from
this
pursuit
which
is
it
barker
repeated
his
tormentor
i
know
it
human
nature
to
deny
it
though
i
never
could
understand
why
if
i
was
engaged
the
sunday
papers
should
have
it
about
as
quick
i
engaged
cried
lemuel
you
ai
yelled
berry
no
give
me
your
hand
neither
am
i
he
shook
lemuel
helpless
hand
with
mock
heroic
fervour
we
are
brothers
from
this
time
forth
barker
you
ca
imagine
how
closely
this
tie
binds
you
to
me
barker
barker
we
are
one
with
no
particular
prospect
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
of
ever
being
he
offered
to
dramatise
a
burst
of
tears
on
lemuel
shoulder
but
lemuel
escaped
from
him
stop
quit
your
fooling
what
if
somebody
should
come
in
they
wo
said
berry
desisting
and
stretching
himself
at
ease
in
the
only
chair
besides
lemuel
with
which
the
office
was
equipped
it
too
late
for
now
the
world
nature
seems
and
wicked
dreams
abuse
the
curtained
we
are
safe
here
from
all
intrusion
and
i
can
lay
bare
my
inmost
thoughts
to
you
barker
if
i
happen
to
have
any
barker
i
awfully
glad
you
not
engaged
to
either
of
those
girls
or
both
and
it
not
altogether
because
i
enjoy
the
boon
companionship
of
another
unengaged
man
but
it
partly
because
i
do
think
shall
i
say
it
say
what
asked
lemuel
not
without
some
prescience
well
you
can
forgive
the
brotherly
frankness
if
you
do
like
it
i
do
think
they
quite
up
to
lemuel
gave
a
sort
of
start
which
berry
interpreted
in
his
own
way
now
hold
on
i
know
just
how
you
feel
been
there
myself
i
have
seen
the
time
too
when
i
thought
any
sort
of
girl
was
too
good
for
alonzo
jr
but
i
do
now
i
think
is
good
enough
for
the
best
i
may
be
mistaken
i
was
the
other
time
but
we
all
begin
that
way
and
the
great
object
is
not
to
keep
on
that
way
see
now
i
suppose
in
love
puppy
love
with
that
little
thing
probably
the
first
girl
you
got
acquainted
with
after
you
came
to
boston
or
may
be
a
sweet
survival
of
the
willoughby
pastures
period
all
right
perfectly
natural
in
either
case
but
do
you
let
it
go
any
further
my
dear
boy
old
man
do
you
let
it
go
any
further
pause
reflect
consider
love
wisely
but
not
too
well
take
the
unsolicited
advice
of
a
pride
joy
shame
remorse
mixed
in
lemuel
heart
which
eased
itself
in
an
involuntary
laugh
at
berry
nonsense
now
what
i
want
you
to
do
dear
boy
or
old
man
as
the
case
may
be
is
to
regard
yourself
in
a
new
light
regard
yourself
for
the
sake
of
the
experiment
as
too
good
for
any
girl
in
boston
no
ca
fetch
it
try
again
lemuel
could
only
laugh
foolishly
well
now
that
singular
pursued
berry
i
supposed
you
could
have
done
it
without
the
least
trouble
well
let
try
something
a
little
less
difficult
look
me
in
the
eye
and
regard
yourself
as
too
good
for
example
for
miss
carver
ha
an
angry
flush
spread
over
lemuel
embarrassed
face
i
wish
behave
yourself
he
stammered
in
any
other
cause
i
would
said
berry
solemnly
but
i
must
be
cruel
to
be
kind
seriously
old
man
if
you
ca
think
yourself
too
good
for
miss
carver
i
wish
you
think
yourself
good
enough
now
i
not
saying
anything
against
the
willoughby
episode
mind
that
has
its
place
in
the
wise
economy
of
nature
just
like
anything
else
but
there
any
outcome
in
it
for
you
you
got
a
future
before
you
barker
and
you
do
want
to
go
and
load
up
with
a
love
affair
that
you
keep
trying
to
unload
as
long
as
you
live
no
sir
look
at
me
i
know
not
an
example
in
some
things
but
in
this
little
business
of
correctly
placed
affections
i
could
give
points
to
solomon
why
am
i
in
love
with
swan
because
i
ca
help
it
for
one
thing
and
because
for
another
thing
she
can
do
more
to
develop
the
hidden
worth
and
unsuspected
powers
of
than
any
other
woman
in
the
world
she
may
never
feel
that
it
her
mission
but
she
ca
shake
my
conviction
that
way
and
i
shall
stay
undeveloped
to
prove
that
i
was
right
well
now
what
you
want
my
friend
is
development
and
you
ca
get
it
where
you
been
going
she
hai
got
it
on
hand
and
what
you
want
to
do
is
not
to
take
something
else
in
its
place
tender
heart
steadfast
affections
loyalty
they
got
at
every
shop
in
town
they
a
drug
in
the
market
you
got
to
say
development
heigh
well
i
just
look
round
a
while
and
if
i
ca
find
it
at
some
of
the
other
stores
come
back
and
take
some
of
that
steadfast
affection
you
say
it
come
off
or
run
in
washing
see
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
said
lemuel
trying
to
summon
an
indignant
feeling
and
laughing
with
a
strange
pleasure
at
heart
you
got
no
right
to
talk
to
me
that
way
i
want
you
should
leave
me
alone
well
since
you
so
pressing
i
will
go
said
berry
easily
but
if
i
find
you
at
our
next
interview
sitting
under
the
shade
of
the
whose
little
seed
i
have
just
dropped
i
shall
feel
that
i
have
not
laboured
in
vain
a
darling
she
a
daisy
she
a
dumpling
she
a
lamb
i
refer
to
miss
swan
of
course
but
on
other
lips
the
terms
are
equally
applicable
to
miss
carver
and
do
you
forget
it
he
swung
out
of
the
office
with
a
mazurka
step
his
silk
hat
gaily
tilted
on
the
side
of
his
head
struck
against
the
and
fell
rolling
across
the
entry
floor
lemuel
laughed
wildly
at
twenty
these
things
are
droll
xxi
a
week
passed
and
lemuel
had
not
tried
to
see
statira
again
he
said
to
himself
that
even
when
he
had
tried
to
do
what
was
right
and
to
show
those
young
ladies
how
much
he
thought
of
her
by
bringing
her
to
see
their
pictures
she
had
acted
very
ungratefully
and
had
as
good
as
tried
to
quarrel
with
him
then
when
he
went
to
see
her
before
his
visit
home
she
was
out
she
had
never
been
out
before
when
he
called
now
he
had
told
berry
that
they
were
not
engaged
at
first
this
shocked
him
as
if
it
were
a
lie
then
he
said
to
himself
that
he
had
a
right
to
make
that
answer
because
berry
had
no
right
to
ask
the
questions
that
led
to
it
then
he
asked
himself
if
he
really
were
engaged
to
statira
he
had
told
her
that
he
liked
her
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
and
she
had
said
as
much
to
him
but
he
pretended
that
he
did
not
know
whether
it
could
be
called
an
engagement
there
was
no
one
who
could
solve
the
question
for
him
and
it
kept
asking
itself
that
whole
week
and
especially
when
he
was
with
miss
carver
as
happened
two
or
three
times
through
berry
connivance
once
he
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
an
evening
in
the
studio
where
he
talked
nearly
all
the
time
with
miss
carver
and
he
found
out
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
an
old
ship
captain
at
corbitant
her
mother
was
dead
and
her
aunt
had
kept
house
for
her
father
it
was
an
old
square
house
that
her
grandfather
built
in
the
days
when
corbitant
had
direct
trade
with
france
she
described
it
minutely
and
told
how
a
french
gentleman
had
died
there
in
exile
at
the
time
of
the
french
revolution
and
who
was
said
to
haunt
the
house
but
miss
carver
had
never
seen
any
ghosts
in
it
they
all
began
to
talk
of
ghosts
and
weird
experiences
even
berry
had
had
some
strange
things
happen
to
him
in
the
west
then
the
talk
broke
in
two
again
and
lemuel
sat
apart
with
miss
carver
who
told
at
length
the
plot
of
a
story
she
had
been
reading
it
was
a
story
called
and
she
said
she
would
lend
it
to
lemuel
she
said
she
did
not
see
how
any
one
could
bear
to
be
the
least
selfish
or
untrue
after
reading
it
that
made
lemuel
feel
cold
but
he
could
not
break
away
from
her
charm
she
sat
where
the
shaded
lamp
threw
its
soft
light
on
one
side
of
her
face
it
looked
almost
like
the
face
of
a
spirit
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
a
heavenly
gentleness
lemuel
asked
himself
how
he
could
ever
have
thought
them
proud
eyes
he
asked
himself
at
the
same
time
and
perpetually
whether
he
was
really
engaged
to
statira
or
not
he
thought
how
different
this
evening
was
from
those
he
spent
with
her
she
could
not
talk
about
anything
but
him
and
her
dress
and
grier
could
not
do
anything
but
say
saucy
things
which
she
thought
were
smart
miss
swan
was
really
witty
it
was
as
good
as
the
theatre
to
hear
her
and
berry
going
on
together
berry
was
pretty
bright
there
was
no
denying
it
he
sang
to
his
banjo
that
night
one
of
the
songs
was
spanish
he
had
learned
it
in
new
mexico
lemuel
began
to
understand
better
how
such
nice
young
ladies
could
go
with
berry
at
first
after
berry
talked
so
to
him
that
night
in
the
office
against
statira
he
determined
that
he
would
keep
away
from
him
but
berry
was
so
sociable
and
that
he
could
not
the
first
thing
he
knew
lemuel
was
laughing
at
something
berry
said
and
then
he
could
not
help
himself
berry
was
coming
now
every
chance
he
had
to
talk
about
the
he
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
lemuel
was
as
much
interested
in
miss
carver
as
he
was
himself
in
miss
swan
and
lemuel
did
begin
to
speak
of
her
in
a
shy
way
berry
asked
him
if
he
had
noticed
that
she
looked
like
that
spanish
picture
of
the
virgin
that
miss
swan
had
pinned
up
next
to
the
door
and
lemuel
admitted
that
there
was
some
resemblance
notice
those
eyes
of
hers
so
deep
and
sorry
for
everybody
in
general
if
it
was
anybody
in
particular
fellow
would
be
in
luck
oh
she
a
dumpling
there
no
mistake
about
it
in
thy
orisons
be
all
my
sins
remembered
that
miss
carver
style
she
looks
as
if
she
just
to
forgive
somebody
something
i
afraid
you
ai
wicked
enough
barker
look
here
what
the
reason
we
ca
make
up
a
little
party
for
the
easter
service
at
the
catholic
cathedral
sunday
night
the
girls
would
like
to
go
i
no
no
i
ca
i
must
said
lemuel
and
he
remained
steadfast
in
his
refusal
it
would
be
the
second
sunday
night
that
he
had
not
seen
statira
and
he
felt
that
he
must
not
let
it
pass
so
berry
went
off
to
the
cathedral
with
the
and
he
kept
out
of
the
way
till
they
were
gone
he
said
to
himself
that
he
would
go
a
little
later
than
usual
to
see
statira
to
let
her
know
that
he
was
not
so
very
anxious
but
when
he
found
her
alone
and
she
cried
on
his
neck
and
owned
that
she
had
not
behaved
as
she
should
that
night
when
she
went
to
see
the
pictures
and
that
she
had
been
afraid
he
hated
her
and
was
not
coming
any
more
he
had
stayed
away
so
long
his
heart
was
melted
and
he
did
everything
to
soothe
and
comfort
her
and
they
were
more
loving
together
than
they
had
been
since
the
first
time
grier
came
in
and
said
through
her
nose
like
an
old
falling
out
of
faithful
friends
renewing
is
of
love
and
statira
exclaimed
in
the
old
way
that
he
had
once
thought
so
cunning
and
rested
there
in
his
arms
with
her
cheek
tight
pressed
against
his
she
did
not
talk
except
when
she
was
greatly
excited
about
something
she
rarely
had
anything
to
say
she
had
certain
little
tricks
poutings
bridlings
starts
outcries
which
had
seemed
the
most
bewitching
things
in
the
world
to
lemuel
she
tried
all
these
now
unaffectedly
enough
in
listening
to
his
account
of
his
visit
home
and
so
far
as
she
could
she
vividly
sympathised
with
him
he
came
away
heavy
and
unhappy
somehow
these
things
no
longer
sufficed
for
him
he
compared
this
evening
with
the
last
he
had
spent
with
the
which
had
left
his
brain
in
a
glow
and
kept
him
awake
for
hours
with
luminous
thoughts
but
he
had
got
over
that
unkindness
to
statira
and
he
was
glad
of
that
he
pitied
her
now
and
he
said
to
himself
that
if
he
could
get
her
away
from
grier
and
under
the
influence
of
such
girls
as
miss
swan
and
miss
carver
it
would
be
much
better
for
her
he
did
not
relent
toward
grier
he
disliked
her
more
than
ever
and
in
the
friendship
which
he
dramatised
between
statira
and
miss
carver
he
saw
her
cast
adrift
without
remorse
sewell
had
told
him
that
he
was
always
at
leisure
monday
night
and
the
next
evening
lemuel
went
to
pay
his
first
visit
to
the
minister
since
his
first
day
in
boston
it
was
early
and
evans
who
usually
came
that
evening
had
not
arrived
yet
but
sewell
had
him
in
his
thought
when
he
hurried
forward
to
meet
his
visitor
oh
is
it
you
barker
he
asked
in
a
note
of
surprise
i
am
glad
to
see
you
i
had
been
intending
to
come
and
look
you
up
again
will
you
sit
down
evans
was
here
the
other
night
and
we
were
talking
of
you
i
hope
you
are
all
well
very
well
thank
you
said
lemuel
taking
the
hand
the
minister
offered
and
then
taking
the
chair
he
indicated
sewell
did
not
know
exactly
whether
to
like
the
greater
ease
which
lemuel
showed
in
his
presence
but
there
was
nothing
presumptuous
in
it
and
he
could
not
help
seeing
the
increased
refinement
of
the
young
man
beauty
the
knot
between
his
eyes
gave
him
interest
while
it
inflicted
a
vague
pang
upon
the
minister
i
have
been
at
home
since
i
saw
lemuel
looked
down
at
his
neat
shoes
to
see
if
they
were
in
fit
state
for
the
and
sewell
eye
sympathetically
following
wandered
to
the
various
details
of
lemuel
simple
and
becoming
dress
the
light
spring
suit
which
he
had
indulged
himself
in
at
the
misfit
parlours
since
his
mother
had
bidden
him
keep
his
money
for
himself
and
not
send
so
much
of
it
home
ah
have
you
cried
the
minister
i
hope
you
found
your
people
all
well
how
is
the
place
looking
i
suppose
the
season
is
quite
so
advanced
as
it
is
with
there
some
snow
in
the
woods
yet
said
lemuel
laying
the
stick
he
carried
across
the
on
his
knees
mother
was
well
but
my
sister
and
her
husband
have
had
a
good
deal
of
oh
i
sorry
for
that
said
sewell
with
the
general
sympathy
which
evans
accused
him
of
keeping
on
tap
professionally
well
how
did
you
like
the
looks
of
willoughby
pastures
compared
with
boston
rather
quieter
i
yes
it
was
quieter
answered
lemuel
but
the
first
touch
of
spring
must
be
very
lovely
there
i
find
myself
very
impatient
with
these
sweet
early
days
in
town
i
envy
you
your
escape
to
such
a
lemuel
opposed
a
cold
silence
to
the
lurking
didacticism
of
these
sentences
and
sewell
hastened
to
add
and
i
wish
i
could
have
had
your
experience
in
contrasting
the
country
and
the
town
after
your
long
sojourn
here
on
your
first
return
home
such
a
chance
can
come
but
once
in
a
lifetime
and
to
very
there
are
some
pleasant
things
about
the
country
lemuel
began
oh
i
am
sure
of
it
cried
sewell
with
cheerful
aimlessness
the
stillness
was
a
kind
of
rest
after
the
noise
here
i
think
any
one
might
be
glad
to
get
back
to
such
a
place
i
was
sure
you
would
interrupted
sewell
if
he
was
discouraged
or
broken
down
any
way
lemuel
calmly
added
oh
said
sewell
you
mean
that
you
found
more
sympathy
among
your
old
friends
and
neighbours
than
you
do
here
no
said
lemuel
bluntly
that
what
city
people
think
but
it
all
a
mistake
there
is
half
the
sympathy
in
the
country
that
there
is
in
the
city
folks
pry
into
each
other
business
more
but
they
really
care
so
much
what
i
mean
is
that
you
could
live
cheaper
and
the
fight
is
so
hard
you
might
have
to
use
your
hands
more
but
you
would
have
to
use
your
head
hardly
at
all
there
is
so
much
opposition
oh
said
sewell
a
second
time
but
this
competition
this
struggle
in
which
one
or
the
other
must
go
to
the
wall
is
that
painful
i
do
know
as
it
is
answered
lemuel
as
long
as
you
young
and
strong
and
it
do
always
follow
that
one
must
go
to
the
wall
seen
some
things
where
both
got
on
sewell
succumbed
to
this
worldly
wisdom
he
was
frequently
at
the
disadvantage
men
of
cloistered
lives
must
be
in
having
his
theories
in
advance
of
his
facts
he
now
left
this
point
and
covertly
touched
another
that
had
come
up
in
his
last
talk
with
evans
about
barker
but
you
find
in
the
country
do
you
a
greater
equality
of
social
condition
people
are
more
on
a
level
and
have
fewer
artificial
yes
there
that
admitted
lemuel
i
worried
a
good
deal
about
that
for
i
had
to
take
a
servant
place
in
a
good
many
things
and
i
thought
folks
looked
down
on
me
for
it
even
when
they
did
seem
to
intend
to
do
it
but
i
guess
it
is
so
bad
as
i
thought
when
i
first
began
to
notice
it
do
you
suppose
it
is
his
voice
was
suddenly
tense
with
personal
interest
in
the
question
which
had
ceased
to
be
abstract
oh
certainly
not
said
the
minister
with
an
ease
which
he
did
not
feel
i
presume
i
had
what
you
may
call
a
servant
place
at
miss
vane
pursued
lemuel
unflinchingly
and
i
been
what
you
may
call
head
waiter
at
the
albans
since
i
been
there
if
a
person
heard
afterwards
when
i
had
made
out
something
if
i
ever
did
that
i
had
been
a
servant
would
they
they
despise
me
for
it
not
unless
they
were
very
silly
people
said
sewell
cordially
i
can
assure
but
if
they
had
ever
seen
me
doing
a
servant
work
would
they
always
remember
it
no
matter
what
i
was
afterwards
sewell
hesitated
and
lemuel
hurried
to
add
i
ask
because
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
be
anything
but
clerk
after
sewell
pitied
the
simple
shame
the
simple
pride
that
is
the
question
for
you
to
ask
my
dear
boy
he
answered
gently
and
with
an
affection
which
he
had
never
felt
for
his
charge
before
another
question
more
important
and
one
which
you
must
ask
yourself
i
care
if
they
did
after
all
the
matter
in
your
own
hands
your
soul
always
your
own
till
you
do
something
yes
i
understand
lemuel
sat
silently
thoughtful
fingering
his
it
seemed
to
sewell
that
he
wished
to
ask
something
else
and
was
mustering
his
courage
but
if
this
was
so
it
exhaled
in
a
sigh
and
he
remained
silent
i
should
be
sorry
pursued
the
minister
to
have
you
dwell
upon
such
things
there
are
certain
ignoble
facts
in
life
which
we
can
best
combat
by
ignoring
them
a
slight
of
almost
any
sort
ceases
to
be
when
you
cease
to
consider
this
did
not
strike
sewell
as
wholly
true
when
he
had
said
it
and
he
was
formulating
some
modification
of
it
in
his
mind
when
lemuel
said
i
presume
a
person
can
help
himself
some
by
being
ashamed
of
caring
for
such
things
and
that
what
i
tried
to
yes
that
what
i
meant
i
guess
i
exaggerated
the
whole
thing
some
but
if
a
thing
is
so
thinking
it
ai
wo
unmake
no
admitted
sewell
reluctantly
but
i
should
be
sorry
all
the
same
if
you
let
it
annoy
grieve
you
what
has
pleased
me
in
what
i
been
able
to
observe
in
you
has
been
your
willingness
to
take
hold
of
any
kind
of
honest
work
i
liked
finding
you
with
your
coat
off
washing
dishes
that
morning
at
the
wayfarer
lodge
and
i
liked
your
going
at
once
to
miss
vane
in
a
as
you
did
of
course
lemuel
interrupted
i
could
do
it
before
i
knew
how
it
was
looked
at
and
could
you
do
it
now
not
if
there
was
anything
ah
that
the
great
curse
of
it
that
what
i
deplore
sewell
broke
out
in
our
young
people
coming
from
the
country
to
the
city
they
must
all
have
some
genteel
occupation
i
do
blame
them
but
i
would
gladly
have
saved
you
this
experience
this
knowledge
if
i
could
i
felt
that
i
had
done
you
a
kind
of
wrong
in
being
the
means
however
indirectly
and
innocently
of
your
coming
to
boston
and
i
would
willingly
have
done
anything
to
have
you
go
back
to
the
country
but
you
seemed
to
distrust
me
to
find
something
hostile
in
me
and
i
did
not
know
how
to
influence
yes
i
understand
that
said
lemuel
i
could
help
it
at
first
but
i
got
to
see
it
all
in
a
different
light
since
then
i
know
that
you
meant
the
best
by
me
i
know
now
that
what
i
wrote
was
worth
anything
and
just
how
you
must
have
looked
at
it
i
did
know
some
things
then
that
i
do
now
and
since
i
have
got
to
know
a
little
more
i
have
understood
better
what
you
meant
by
all
you
i
am
very
glad
said
sewell
with
sincere
humility
that
you
have
kept
no
hard
feeling
against
oh
not
at
all
it
all
right
now
i
could
explain
very
well
that
i
had
come
to
the
city
just
to
be
in
the
city
but
because
i
had
to
do
something
to
help
along
at
home
you
did
seem
to
understand
that
there
anything
there
for
me
to
take
hold
no
i
afraid
i
did
or
would
quite
understand
that
i
was
talking
and
acting
i
afraid
from
a
preconceived
lemuel
made
no
reply
not
having
learned
yet
to
utter
the
pleasant
generalities
with
which
city
people
left
a
subject
and
after
a
while
sewell
added
i
am
glad
to
have
seen
your
face
so
often
at
church
you
have
been
a
great
deal
in
my
mind
and
i
have
wished
to
do
something
to
make
your
life
happy
and
useful
to
you
in
the
best
way
here
but
i
have
quite
known
at
this
point
sewell
realised
that
it
was
nearly
eight
months
since
lemuel
had
come
to
boston
and
he
said
contritely
i
have
not
made
the
proper
effort
i
afraid
but
i
did
not
know
exactly
how
to
approach
you
you
were
rather
a
difficult
subject
he
continued
with
a
smile
in
which
lemuel
consented
to
join
but
now
that
we
come
to
a
clearer
understanding
he
broke
off
and
asked
have
you
many
acquaintances
in
boston
lemuel
hesitated
and
cleared
his
throat
not
something
in
his
manner
prompted
the
minister
to
say
that
is
such
a
very
important
thing
for
young
men
in
a
strange
place
i
wish
you
would
come
oftener
to
see
us
hereafter
young
men
in
the
want
of
companionship
often
form
disadvantageous
acquaintances
which
they
ca
shake
off
afterwards
when
they
might
wish
to
do
so
i
do
mean
evil
acquaintance
i
certainly
could
mean
that
in
your
case
but
frivolous
ones
from
which
nothing
high
or
noble
can
come
nothing
of
improvement
or
lemuel
started
at
the
word
and
blushed
it
was
berry
word
sewell
put
his
own
construction
on
the
start
and
the
blush
especially
he
went
on
i
should
wish
any
young
man
whom
i
was
interested
in
to
know
refined
and
noble
he
felt
that
this
was
perhaps
in
lemuel
case
too
much
like
prescribing
port
wine
and
carriage
exercise
to
an
indigent
patient
and
he
added
if
you
can
not
know
such
women
it
is
better
to
know
none
at
all
it
is
not
what
women
say
or
do
so
much
as
the
art
they
have
of
inspiring
a
man
to
make
the
best
of
himself
the
accidental
acquaintances
that
young
people
are
so
apt
to
form
are
in
most
cases
very
detrimental
there
is
no
harm
in
them
of
themselves
perhaps
but
all
irregularity
in
the
life
of
the
young
is
to
be
do
you
mean
asked
lemuel
with
that
concreteness
which
had
alarmed
sewell
before
that
they
ought
to
be
regularly
introduced
i
mean
that
a
young
girl
who
allowed
a
young
man
to
make
her
acquaintance
outside
of
the
the
social
sanctions
would
be
apt
to
be
a
silly
or
romantic
person
at
the
best
of
course
there
are
exceptions
but
i
should
be
very
sorry
if
any
young
man
i
knew
no
why
should
i
say
at
once
should
involve
himself
in
any
such
way
one
thing
leads
to
another
especially
with
the
young
and
the
very
fact
of
irregularity
of
romance
of
strangeness
in
an
acquaintance
throws
a
false
glamour
over
the
relation
and
appeals
to
the
sentiments
in
an
unwarranted
yes
that
is
so
said
lemuel
the
admission
stimulated
sewell
in
the
belief
that
he
had
a
clue
in
his
hand
which
it
was
his
duty
to
follow
up
the
whole
affair
loses
proportion
and
balance
the
fancy
becomes
excited
and
some
of
the
most
important
interests
the
very
most
important
interests
of
life
are
committed
to
lemuel
remained
silent
and
it
seemed
the
silence
of
conviction
a
young
man
is
better
for
knowing
women
older
than
himself
more
cultivated
devoted
to
higher
things
of
course
young
people
must
see
each
other
must
fall
in
love
and
get
married
but
there
need
be
no
haste
about
such
things
if
there
is
haste
if
there
is
rashness
thoughtlessness
there
is
sure
to
be
unhappiness
men
are
apt
to
outgrow
their
wives
intellectually
if
their
wives
minds
are
set
on
home
and
children
as
they
should
be
and
allowance
for
this
ought
to
be
made
if
possible
i
would
rather
that
in
the
beginning
the
wife
should
be
the
mental
superior
i
hope
it
will
be
several
years
yet
before
you
think
seriously
of
such
things
but
when
the
time
comes
i
hope
you
will
have
seen
some
young
girl
there
are
such
for
every
one
of
us
whom
it
is
civilisation
and
enlightenment
refinement
and
elevation
simply
to
know
on
the
other
hand
a
silly
girl
influence
is
degrading
and
ruinous
she
either
drags
those
attached
to
her
down
to
her
own
level
or
she
remains
a
weight
and
a
clog
upon
the
life
of
a
man
who
loves
yes
said
lemuel
with
a
sigh
which
sewell
interpreted
as
that
of
relief
from
danger
recognised
in
time
he
pursued
eagerly
i
could
not
warn
any
one
too
earnestly
against
such
an
lemuel
rose
and
looked
about
with
a
troubled
glance
sewell
continued
any
such
marriage
a
marriage
upon
any
such
conditions
is
sure
to
be
calamitous
and
if
the
conditions
are
recognised
beforehand
it
is
sure
to
be
iniquitous
so
far
from
urging
the
fulfilment
of
even
a
promise
in
such
a
case
i
would
have
every
such
engagement
broken
in
the
interest
of
humanity
of
morality
sewell
came
into
the
room
and
gave
a
little
start
of
surprise
apparently
not
mixed
with
pleasure
at
seeing
lemuel
she
had
never
been
able
to
share
her
husband
interest
in
him
while
insisting
upon
his
responsibility
she
disliked
him
not
logically
but
naturally
for
the
wrong
and
folly
which
he
had
been
the
means
of
her
husband
involving
himself
in
miss
vane
kindliness
toward
lemuel
which
still
survived
and
which
expressed
itself
in
questions
about
him
whenever
she
met
the
minister
was
something
that
sewell
could
not
understand
she
now
said
oh
barker
and
coldly
gave
him
her
hand
have
you
been
well
must
you
go
yes
thank
you
i
have
got
to
be
getting
back
well
good
he
bowed
to
the
sewells
you
must
come
again
to
see
me
said
the
minister
and
looked
at
his
wife
yes
it
has
been
a
very
long
time
since
you
were
here
sewell
added
i
have
had
a
great
deal
of
time
to
myself
said
lemuel
and
he
contrived
to
get
himself
out
of
the
room
sewell
followed
him
down
to
the
door
in
the
endeavour
to
say
something
more
on
the
subject
his
wife
had
interrupted
but
he
only
contrived
to
utter
some
feeble
repetitions
he
came
back
in
vexation
which
he
visited
upon
lemuel
silly
fellow
he
exclaimed
what
has
he
been
doing
now
asked
sewell
with
reproachful
discouragement
oh
do
know
i
suspect
that
he
been
involving
himself
in
some
ridiculous
love
affair
sewell
looked
a
silent
inculpation
largely
conjecture
on
my
part
of
course
he
about
as
confiding
as
an
oyster
but
i
fancy
i
have
said
some
things
in
a
conditional
way
that
will
give
him
pause
i
suspect
from
his
manner
that
he
has
entangled
himself
with
some
other
young
simpleton
and
that
he
ashamed
of
it
or
tired
of
it
already
if
that
the
case
i
have
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
i
told
him
that
a
foolish
rash
engagement
was
better
broken
than
kept
the
foolish
marriages
that
people
rush
into
are
the
greatest
bane
of
life
and
would
you
really
have
advised
him
david
asked
his
wife
to
break
off
an
engagement
if
he
had
made
one
of
course
i
should
i
then
i
am
glad
i
came
in
in
time
to
prevent
your
doing
anything
so
wicked
sewell
turned
from
his
desk
where
he
was
about
to
sit
down
in
astonishment
yes
do
you
think
that
nobody
else
is
to
be
considered
in
such
a
thing
what
about
the
poor
silly
girl
if
he
breaks
off
with
her
oh
you
men
are
all
alike
even
the
best
you
think
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
for
a
young
man
to
be
burdened
with
a
foolish
love
affair
at
the
beginning
of
his
career
but
you
never
think
of
the
girl
whose
whole
career
is
spoiled
perhaps
if
the
affair
is
broken
off
has
she
any
right
to
be
considered
i
should
think
said
sewell
distinctly
daunted
that
they
were
equally
fortunate
if
it
were
broken
o
my
dear
you
know
you
do
think
anything
of
the
kind
if
he
has
more
mind
than
she
has
and
is
capable
of
doing
something
in
the
world
he
goes
on
and
forgets
her
but
she
remembers
him
perhaps
it
her
one
chance
in
life
to
get
married
to
have
a
home
you
know
very
well
that
in
a
case
of
that
kind
a
rash
engagement
as
you
call
it
both
are
to
blame
and
shall
one
do
all
the
suffering
very
probably
his
fancy
was
taken
first
and
he
followed
her
up
and
flattered
her
into
liking
him
and
now
shall
he
leave
her
because
he
tired
of
her
yes
said
sewell
recovering
from
the
first
confusion
which
his
unexpected
difference
of
opinion
had
thrown
him
into
i
should
think
that
was
the
very
best
reason
in
the
world
why
he
should
leave
her
would
his
marrying
make
matters
worse
or
better
if
he
were
tired
of
her
as
for
wickedness
i
should
feel
myself
guilty
if
i
did
not
do
my
utmost
to
prevent
marriages
between
people
when
one
or
other
wished
to
break
their
engagement
and
had
not
the
moral
courage
to
do
so
there
is
no
more
pernicious
delusion
than
that
one
word
ought
to
be
kept
in
such
an
affair
after
the
heart
has
gone
out
of
it
simply
because
it
been
david
but
sewell
was
not
to
be
restrained
i
am
right
about
this
lucy
and
you
know
it
half
the
miserable
marriages
in
the
world
could
be
prevented
if
there
were
only
some
frank
and
fearless
adviser
at
hand
to
say
to
the
foolish
things
that
if
they
no
longer
fully
and
freely
love
each
other
they
can
commit
no
treason
so
deadly
as
being
true
to
their
word
i
wish
he
now
added
that
i
could
be
the
means
of
breaking
off
every
marriage
that
the
slightest
element
of
doubt
enters
into
beforehand
i
should
leave
much
less
work
for
the
divorce
courts
the
trouble
comes
from
that
crazy
and
mischievous
principle
of
false
that
i
always
crying
out
against
if
a
man
has
ceased
to
love
the
woman
he
has
promised
to
marry
or
the
best
possible
thing
they
can
do
the
only
righteous
thing
is
not
to
sewell
could
not
deny
this
she
directed
an
oblique
attack
from
another
quarter
as
women
do
while
affecting
not
to
have
changed
her
ground
at
all
very
well
then
david
i
wish
you
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
crazy
and
mischievous
principle
yourself
i
wish
you
would
let
this
ridiculous
barker
of
yours
alone
from
this
time
forth
he
has
found
a
good
place
where
he
is
of
use
and
where
he
is
doing
very
well
now
i
think
your
responsibility
is
fairly
ended
i
hope
you
wo
meddle
with
his
love
affairs
if
he
has
any
for
if
you
do
you
will
probably
have
your
hands
full
he
is
very
good
looking
and
all
sorts
of
silly
little
geese
will
be
falling
in
love
with
well
so
far
his
love
troubles
are
purely
conjectural
said
sewell
with
a
laugh
i
bound
to
say
that
barker
himself
did
say
a
word
to
justify
the
conjecture
that
he
was
either
in
love
or
wished
to
be
out
of
it
however
i
given
him
some
wholesome
advice
which
he
be
all
the
better
for
taking
merely
as
a
prophylactic
if
nothing
i
am
tired
of
him
sighed
sewell
is
he
going
to
keep
perpetually
turning
up
in
this
way
i
hope
you
were
not
very
pressing
with
him
in
your
invitations
to
him
to
call
again
sewell
smiled
you
were
not
my
you
let
him
take
too
much
of
your
time
i
was
so
provoked
when
i
heard
you
going
on
with
him
that
i
came
down
to
put
an
end
to
well
you
succeeded
said
sewell
easily
do
you
think
he
greatly
improved
in
the
short
time
he
been
in
the
city
he
very
well
dressed
i
hope
he
is
he
not
only
well
dressed
but
he
beginning
to
be
well
spoken
i
believe
he
beginning
to
observe
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
not
talking
through
the
nose
he
still
says
do
know
as
but
most
of
the
men
they
turn
out
of
harvard
say
that
i
heard
some
of
the
professors
say
sewell
was
not
apparently
interested
in
this
xxii
that
night
lemuel
told
harmon
that
she
must
not
expect
him
to
do
anything
thenceforward
but
look
after
the
accounts
and
the
general
management
she
must
get
a
and
a
boy
to
run
the
elevator
she
consented
to
this
as
she
would
have
consented
to
almost
anything
else
that
he
proposed
he
had
become
necessary
to
the
management
of
the
albans
in
every
department
and
if
the
lady
boarders
felt
that
they
could
not
now
get
on
without
him
harmon
was
even
more
dependent
with
her
still
nominally
at
the
head
of
affairs
and
controlling
the
expenses
as
a
whole
no
radical
reform
could
be
effected
but
there
were
details
of
the
outlay
in
which
lemuel
was
of
use
and
he
had
brought
greater
comfort
into
the
house
for
less
money
he
rejected
her
old
and
simple
device
of
postponing
the
payment
of
debt
as
an
economical
measure
and
substituted
cash
dealings
with
new
purveyors
he
gradually
but
inevitably
took
charge
of
the
storeroom
and
stopped
the
waste
there
early
in
his
administration
he
had
observed
the
gross
and
foolish
prodigality
with
which
the
portions
were
sent
from
the
and
after
replacing
harmon
nephew
there
he
established
a
standard
portion
that
gave
all
the
needed
variety
and
still
kept
the
quantity
within
bounds
it
came
to
his
taking
charge
of
this
department
entirely
and
as
steward
he
carved
the
meats
and
saw
that
nothing
was
in
a
way
to
become
cold
before
he
opened
the
doors
as
his
activities
promoted
the
leisure
which
harmon
had
always
enjoyed
and
which
her
increasing
bulk
fitted
her
to
adorn
her
nephew
willingly
relinquished
the
dignity
of
steward
he
said
that
his
furnaces
were
as
much
as
he
wanted
to
take
care
of
especially
as
in
former
years
when
it
had
begun
to
come
spring
he
had
experienced
a
stress
of
mind
in
keeping
the
heat
just
right
when
the
ladies
were
all
calling
down
the
tubes
for
more
of
it
or
less
of
it
which
he
should
now
be
very
glad
not
to
have
complicated
with
other
cares
he
said
that
now
he
could
look
forward
to
the
month
of
may
with
some
pleasure
the
guests
sensibly
or
insensibly
according
to
their
several
temperaments
shared
the
increased
ease
that
came
from
management
the
service
was
better
in
every
way
their
beds
were
promptly
made
their
rooms
were
periodically
swept
every
night
when
they
came
up
from
dinner
they
found
their
pitchers
of
at
their
doors
this
change
was
not
accomplished
without
much
of
that
rebellion
and
renunciation
which
was
known
at
the
albans
as
kicking
chambermaids
and
kicked
but
they
were
replaced
by
lemuel
who
went
himself
to
the
intelligence
office
and
pledged
the
new
ones
to
his
rule
beforehand
there
was
even
some
kicking
among
the
guests
who
objected
to
the
new
portions
and
to
having
a
second
bill
sent
them
if
the
first
remained
unpaid
for
a
week
but
the
general
sense
of
the
hotel
was
in
lemuel
favour
he
had
no
great
pleasure
in
the
reform
he
had
effected
his
heart
was
not
in
it
except
as
waste
and
disorder
and
carelessness
were
painful
to
him
he
suffered
to
promote
a
better
state
of
things
as
many
a
woman
whose
love
is
for
books
or
pictures
or
society
suffers
for
the
perfection
of
her
housekeeping
and
sacrifices
her
taste
to
achieve
it
he
would
have
liked
better
to
read
to
go
to
lectures
to
hear
sermons
with
the
knowledge
of
evans
life
as
an
editor
and
the
incentive
of
a
writer
near
him
he
would
have
liked
to
try
again
if
he
could
not
write
something
though
the
shame
of
his
failure
in
sewell
eyes
had
burned
so
deep
above
all
since
he
had
begun
to
see
how
city
people
regarded
the
kind
of
work
he
had
been
doing
he
would
have
liked
to
get
out
of
the
hotel
business
altogether
if
he
could
have
been
sure
of
any
other
as
the
spring
advanced
his
cares
grew
lighter
most
of
the
regular
boarders
went
away
to
country
hotels
and
became
regular
boarders
there
their
places
were
only
partially
filled
by
transients
from
the
south
and
west
who
came
and
went
and
left
lemuel
large
spaces
of
leisure
in
which
he
read
or
deputed
harmon
nephew
to
the
care
of
the
office
and
pursued
his
studies
of
boston
sometimes
with
evans
whose
newspaper
kept
him
in
town
and
who
liked
to
prowl
about
with
him
and
to
frequent
the
odd
summer
entertainments
but
mostly
alone
they
became
friends
after
a
fashion
and
were
in
each
other
confidence
as
regarded
their
opinions
and
ideas
rather
than
their
history
now
and
then
evans
dropped
a
word
about
the
boy
he
had
lost
or
his
health
but
lemuel
kept
his
past
locked
fast
in
his
breast
the
had
gone
early
in
the
summer
and
berry
had
left
boston
for
wyoming
at
the
end
of
the
spring
term
of
the
he
had
not
been
able
to
make
up
his
mind
to
pop
before
miss
swan
departed
but
he
thought
he
should
fetch
it
by
another
winter
and
he
had
got
leave
to
write
to
her
on
condition
he
said
that
he
should
conduct
the
whole
correspondence
himself
miss
carver
had
left
lemuel
dreaming
of
her
as
an
ideal
yet
true
with
a
slow
rustic
constancy
to
statira
for
all
that
had
been
said
and
done
he
had
not
swerved
explicitly
from
her
there
was
no
talk
of
marriage
between
them
and
could
not
be
but
they
were
lovers
still
and
when
miss
carver
was
gone
and
the
finer
charm
of
her
society
was
unfelt
he
went
back
to
much
of
the
old
pleasure
he
had
felt
in
statira
love
the
resentment
of
her
the
shame
for
her
ignorance
passed
the
sense
of
her
devotion
remained
grier
wanted
her
to
go
home
with
her
for
part
of
the
summer
but
she
would
not
have
consented
if
lemuel
had
not
insisted
she
wrote
him
back
scrawly
little
letters
in
one
of
which
she
told
him
that
her
cough
was
all
gone
and
she
was
as
well
as
ever
she
took
a
little
more
cold
when
she
returned
to
town
in
the
first
harsh
september
weather
and
her
cough
returned
but
she
said
she
did
not
call
it
anything
now
the
hotel
began
to
fill
up
again
for
the
winter
berry
preceded
the
by
some
nervous
weeks
in
which
he
speculated
upon
what
he
should
do
if
they
did
not
come
at
all
then
they
came
and
the
winter
passed
with
repetitions
of
the
last
winter
events
and
a
store
of
common
memories
that
enriched
the
present
and
insensibly
deepened
the
intimacy
in
which
lemuel
found
himself
he
could
not
tell
whither
the
present
was
carrying
him
he
only
knew
that
he
had
drifted
so
far
from
the
squalor
of
his
past
that
it
seemed
like
the
shadow
of
a
shameful
dream
he
did
not
go
to
see
statira
so
often
as
he
used
and
she
was
patient
with
his
absences
and
defended
him
against
grier
who
did
not
scruple
to
tell
her
that
she
believed
the
fellow
was
fooling
with
her
and
who
could
not
always
keep
down
a
mounting
dislike
of
lemuel
in
his
presence
one
night
towards
spring
when
he
returned
early
from
statira
he
found
berry
in
the
office
at
the
albans
that
you
old
man
he
asked
well
i
glad
you
come
just
going
to
leave
a
little
billy
ducks
for
you
here
but
now
i
need
the
young
ladies
sent
me
down
to
ask
if
you
had
a
copy
of
whittier
poems
they
want
to
find
something
in
it
i
told
longfellow
would
do
just
as
well
but
i
could
seem
to
convince
they
say
he
did
write
the
particular
poem
they
yes
i
got
whittier
poems
here
said
lemuel
unlocking
his
desk
it
belongs
to
evans
i
guess
he
wo
care
if
i
lend
well
now
i
tell
you
what
said
berry
do
you
let
a
borrowed
book
like
that
go
out
of
your
hands
heigh
you
just
bring
it
up
yourself
see
he
winked
the
eye
next
lemuel
with
exaggerated
insinuation
they
respect
you
all
the
more
for
being
so
scrupulous
and
i
guess
they
wo
be
very
much
disappointed
on
general
principles
if
you
come
along
there
lots
of
human
nature
in
girls
the
best
of
tell
i
left
you
lookin
for
it
i
do
mind
a
lie
or
two
in
a
good
cause
but
you
hurry
along
up
he
was
gone
before
lemuel
could
stop
him
he
could
not
do
anything
but
follow
it
appeared
that
it
was
miss
swan
who
wished
to
see
the
poem
she
could
not
remember
the
name
of
it
but
she
was
sure
she
should
know
it
if
she
saw
it
in
the
index
she
mingled
these
statements
with
her
greetings
to
lemuel
and
miss
carver
seemed
as
glad
to
see
him
she
had
a
little
more
colour
than
usual
and
they
were
all
smiling
so
that
he
knew
berry
had
been
getting
off
some
of
his
jokes
but
he
did
not
care
miss
swan
found
the
poem
as
she
had
predicted
and
now
all
keep
still
she
said
and
i
read
but
she
suddenly
added
or
no
you
read
it
barker
wo
you
if
barker
ai
just
in
voice
i
read
it
suggested
berry
but
she
would
not
let
him
make
this
diversion
she
ignored
his
offer
and
insisted
upon
lemuel
reading
jessie
says
you
read
beautifully
that
passage
in
she
reminded
him
but
lemuel
said
it
was
only
a
few
lines
and
tried
to
excuse
himself
at
heart
he
was
proud
of
his
reading
and
he
ended
by
taking
the
book
when
he
had
finished
the
two
girls
sighed
is
it
beautiful
jessie
said
miss
swan
beautiful
answered
her
friend
berry
yawned
well
i
do
see
much
difference
between
that
and
a
poem
of
longfellow
why
would
longfellow
have
done
just
as
well
honestly
now
why
is
one
poem
just
as
good
as
another
for
all
practical
purposes
it
is
for
some
people
said
miss
swan
berry
figured
an
extreme
anguish
by
writhing
in
his
chair
miss
swan
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
and
they
began
to
talk
in
their
usual
banter
which
miss
carver
never
took
part
in
and
which
lemuel
was
quite
incapable
of
sharing
if
it
had
come
to
savage
sarcasm
or
a
logical
encounter
he
could
have
held
his
own
but
he
had
a
natural
weight
and
slowness
that
disabled
him
from
keeping
up
with
berry
light
talk
he
envied
it
because
it
seemed
to
make
everybody
like
him
and
lemuel
would
willingly
have
been
liked
miss
carver
began
to
talk
to
him
about
the
book
and
then
about
evans
she
asked
him
if
he
went
much
to
his
rooms
and
lemuel
said
no
not
at
all
since
the
first
time
evans
had
asked
him
up
he
said
after
a
pause
that
he
did
not
know
whether
he
wanted
him
to
come
i
should
think
he
would
said
miss
carver
it
must
be
very
gloomy
for
him
with
his
wife
such
an
invalid
he
seems
naturally
such
a
gay
yes
that
what
i
think
said
lemuel
i
wonder
said
the
girl
if
it
seems
to
you
harder
for
a
naturally
cheerful
person
to
bear
things
than
for
one
who
has
always
been
rather
melancholy
yes
it
does
he
answered
with
the
pleasure
and
surprise
young
people
have
in
discovering
any
community
of
feeling
they
have
thought
themselves
so
utterly
unlike
each
other
i
wonder
why
it
should
i
do
know
perhaps
it
is
so
but
i
always
pity
the
cheerful
person
the
they
recognised
an
amusing
unreason
in
this
and
laughed
miss
swan
across
the
room
had
caught
the
name
are
you
talking
of
evans
berry
got
his
banjo
down
from
the
wall
where
miss
swan
allowed
him
to
keep
it
as
and
began
to
tune
it
i
do
believe
it
agrees
with
this
banjoseph
being
an
object
of
virtue
he
said
what
shall
it
be
ladies
something
light
and
gay
adapted
to
disperse
gloomy
reflections
he
played
a
fandango
how
do
you
like
that
it
has
a
tinge
of
melancholy
in
it
and
yet
it
lively
too
as
a
friend
of
mine
used
to
say
about
the
dead
was
his
name
berry
asked
miss
swan
not
alonzo
returned
berry
tranquilly
and
he
and
miss
swan
began
to
joke
together
i
know
a
friend
of
evans
said
lemuel
to
miss
carver
mr
sewell
have
you
ever
heard
him
preach
oh
yes
indeed
we
go
nearly
every
sunday
i
nearly
always
go
in
the
evening
now
said
lemuel
do
you
like
him
yes
said
the
girl
there
something
about
him
i
do
know
what
that
does
leave
you
feeling
how
bad
you
are
but
makes
you
want
to
be
better
he
helps
you
so
and
he
so
clear
and
he
shows
that
had
all
the
mean
and
silly
thoughts
that
you
have
i
do
know
it
as
if
he
were
talking
for
each
person
yes
that
is
exactly
the
way
i
feel
lemuel
was
proud
of
the
coincidence
he
said
to
commend
himself
further
to
miss
carver
i
have
just
been
round
to
see
i
should
think
you
would
value
his
acquaintance
beyond
anything
said
the
girl
is
he
just
as
earnest
and
simple
as
he
is
in
the
pulpit
he
just
the
same
every
lemuel
went
a
little
further
i
knew
him
before
i
came
to
boston
he
boarded
one
summer
where
we
as
he
spoke
he
thought
of
the
grey
old
unpainted
house
and
of
his
with
his
on
the
and
his
mother
bloomers
he
thought
of
his
arrest
and
his
night
in
the
his
trial
and
the
wayfarer
lodge
and
he
wondered
that
he
could
think
of
such
things
and
still
look
such
a
girl
in
the
face
but
he
was
not
without
that
strange
joy
in
their
being
unknown
to
her
which
reserved
and
latent
natures
feel
in
mere
reticence
and
which
we
all
experience
in
some
degree
when
we
talk
with
people
and
think
of
our
undiscovered
lives
they
went
on
a
long
time
matching
their
opinions
and
feelings
about
many
things
as
young
people
do
and
fancying
that
much
of
what
they
said
was
new
with
them
when
he
came
away
after
ten
he
thought
of
one
of
the
things
that
sewell
had
said
about
the
society
of
refined
and
noble
women
it
was
not
so
much
what
they
said
or
did
that
helped
it
was
something
in
them
that
made
men
say
and
do
their
best
and
help
themselves
to
be
refined
and
noble
men
to
make
the
most
of
themselves
in
their
presence
he
believed
that
this
was
what
miss
carver
had
done
and
he
thought
how
different
it
was
with
him
when
he
came
away
from
an
evening
with
statira
again
he
experienced
that
compassion
for
her
in
the
midst
of
his
pride
and
exultation
he
asked
himself
what
he
could
do
to
help
her
he
did
not
see
how
she
could
be
changed
berry
followed
him
downstairs
and
wanted
to
talk
the
evening
over
i
do
see
how
i
going
to
stand
it
much
longer
barker
he
said
i
shall
have
to
pop
pretty
soon
or
die
one
of
the
two
and
i
afraid
either
one
kill
me
was
she
lovely
honey
in
the
comb
sugar
in
the
gourd
say
i
wonder
what
it
is
about
popping
anyway
that
makes
it
so
hard
barker
it
simply
a
matter
of
business
if
you
come
to
boil
it
down
you
offer
a
fellow
so
many
cattle
and
let
him
take
or
leave
but
if
the
fellow
happens
to
have
on
a
long
slim
dress
of
some
colour
and
holds
her
head
like
a
whole
floral
tribute
on
a
stem
and
happen
to
be
the
cattle
offering
you
ca
feel
so
independent
about
it
somehow
well
the
use
she
a
daisy
if
ever
there
was
one
ever
notice
what
a
peculiar
blue
her
eyes
are
blue
said
lemuel
they
look
here
old
man
said
berry
compassionately
do
you
think
come
down
here
to
fool
away
my
time
talking
about
miss
carver
take
some
saturday
afternoon
for
that
when
we
have
got
anything
else
to
do
but
it
miss
swan
that
has
the
floor
at
present
what
were
you
two
talking
about
over
there
so
long
i
ca
get
along
with
miss
carver
worth
a
i
hardly
know
what
we
did
talk
about
said
lemuel
dreamily
well
i
got
the
same
complaint
i
could
tell
you
ten
words
that
madeline
said
in
thine
absence
let
me
call
thee
madeline
sweet
but
i
knew
it
was
making
an
immortal
spirit
of
me
right
straight
along
every
time
the
worst
thing
about
an
evening
like
this
is
it
do
seem
to
last
any
time
at
all
why
when
those
girls
began
to
put
up
their
hands
to
hide
their
yawns
i
felt
like
i
was
just
starting
in
for
a
short
call
i
wish
i
could
have
had
a
good
phonograph
around
i
put
it
on
my
sleepless
pillow
and
unwind
its
precious
record
all
through
the
watches
of
the
he
imitated
the
thin
phantasmal
squeak
of
the
instrument
in
repeating
a
number
of
miss
swan
characteristic
phrases
yes
sir
a
pocket
phonograph
is
the
thing
i
i
do
see
how
you
can
talk
the
way
you
do
said
lemuel
shuddering
inwardly
at
berry
audacious
freedom
and
yet
finding
a
certain
comfort
in
it
that
just
the
way
i
felt
myself
at
first
but
you
get
over
it
as
you
go
along
the
nicest
thing
about
their
style
of
angel
is
that
they
perfectly
human
after
all
you
do
believe
it
now
of
course
but
you
it
only
heightened
lemuel
conception
of
miss
carver
character
to
have
berry
talk
so
lightly
and
daringly
of
her
in
her
relation
to
him
he
lay
long
awake
after
he
went
to
bed
and
in
the
turmoil
of
his
thoughts
one
thing
was
clear
so
pure
and
high
a
being
must
never
know
anything
of
his
shameful
past
which
seemed
to
dishonour
her
through
his
mere
vicinity
he
must
go
far
from
her
and
she
must
not
know
why
but
long
afterwards
sewell
would
tell
her
and
then
she
would
understand
he
owed
her
this
all
the
more
because
he
could
see
now
that
she
was
not
one
of
the
silly
persons
as
sewell
called
them
who
would
think
meanly
of
him
for
having
in
his
ignorance
and
inexperience
done
a
servant
work
his
mind
had
changed
about
that
and
he
wondered
that
he
could
ever
have
suspected
her
of
such
a
thing
about
noon
the
next
day
the
street
door
was
opened
hesitatingly
as
if
by
some
one
not
used
to
the
place
and
when
lemuel
looked
up
from
the
menus
he
was
writing
he
saw
the
figure
of
one
of
those
tramps
who
from
time
to
time
presented
themselves
and
pretended
to
want
work
he
scanned
the
vagabond
sharply
as
he
stood
moulding
a
soft
hat
on
his
hands
and
trying
to
superinduce
an
air
of
piteous
appeal
upon
the
natural
gaiety
of
his
swarthy
face
well
what
wanted
a
dawning
conjecture
that
had
flickered
up
in
the
tramp
eyes
flashed
into
full
recognition
why
mate
lemuel
heart
stood
still
what
what
do
you
want
here
why
do
you
know
me
mate
all
his
calamity
confronted
lemuel
no
he
said
but
nothing
in
him
supported
the
lie
he
had
uttered
wayfarer
lodge
suggested
the
other
cheerfully
do
you
remember
no
i
guess
you
do
said
the
mate
easily
anyway
i
remember
lemuel
feeble
defence
gave
way
come
in
here
he
said
and
he
shut
the
door
upon
the
intruder
and
himself
and
submitted
to
his
fate
what
is
it
he
asked
huskily
why
mate
what
the
matter
nobody
goin
to
hurt
you
said
the
other
encouragingly
what
your
lay
here
lay
yes
got
a
job
here
i
the
clerk
said
lemuel
with
the
ghost
of
his
former
pride
of
office
clerk
said
the
tramp
with
incredulity
where
your
diamond
pin
where
your
rings
he
seemed
willing
to
prolong
the
playful
inquiry
where
your
patent
leather
boots
it
not
a
common
hotel
it
a
sort
of
a
family
hotel
and
i
the
clerk
what
do
you
want
the
young
fellow
lounged
back
easily
in
his
chair
why
i
did
drop
in
to
beat
the
house
out
of
a
quarter
if
i
could
or
may
be
ten
cents
thank
you
sir
god
bless
you
he
interrupted
himself
to
burlesque
a
professional
gratitude
that
style
of
thing
you
know
but
i
know
about
it
now
look
here
mate
what
the
reason
you
could
get
me
a
job
here
too
i
been
off
on
a
six
months
cruise
since
i
saw
you
and
i
like
a
job
on
shore
first
rate
could
you
kind
of
ring
me
in
for
something
i
ai
afraid
of
work
although
i
never
did
pretend
to
love
it
but
i
should
like
to
reform
now
and
get
into
something
steady
heigh
there
is
anything
to
do
there
no
place
for
you
lemuel
began
oh
pshaw
now
mate
you
think
pleaded
the
other
i
take
any
sort
of
a
job
i
do
care
what
it
is
i
ai
got
any
o
that
false
modesty
about
me
been
round
too
much
and
i
do
want
to
go
back
to
the
wayfarer
lodge
it
a
good
place
and
i
know
my
welcome
warm
and
waitin
for
me
between
two
hot
plates
but
the
thing
of
it
is
demoralisin
that
what
the
chaplain
said
just
afore
i
left
the
ship
i
promised
him
i
give
work
a
try
anyway
now
you
just
think
up
something
i
ai
in
any
in
proof
he
threw
his
soft
hat
on
the
desk
and
took
up
one
of
the
this
your
bill
of
fare
well
it
ai
bad
vurmiselly

and
coffee
why
mate
lemuel
sat
dumb
and
motionless
he
could
see
no
way
out
of
the
net
that
had
entangled
him
he
began
feebly
to
repeat
there
is
anything
when
some
one
tried
the
door
mr
barker
called
harmon
you
in
there
he
made
it
worse
by
waiting
a
moment
before
he
rose
and
opened
the
door
i
did
know
i
locked
the
lie
came
unbidden
he
groaned
inwardly
to
think
how
he
was
telling
nothing
but
lies
harmon
did
not
come
in
she
glanced
with
a
little
question
at
the
young
fellow
who
had
gathered
his
hat
from
the
table
and
risen
with
gay
politeness
it
was
a
crisis
of
the
old
sort
the
elevator
boy
had
kicked
and
harmon
said
i
just
stopped
to
say
that
i
was
going
out
and
i
could
stop
at
the
intelligence
office
myself
to
get
an
elevator
boy
the
mate
took
the
word
with
a
joyous
laugh
at
the
coincidence
just
what
me
and
barker
was
talking
about
i
from
up
his
way
and
i
just
come
down
to
boston
to
see
if
i
could
look
up
a
job
and
he
was
tellin
me
in
here
about
your
wantin
a
telegraph
i
mean
a
but
he
did
think
it
would
suit
me
but
i
should
like
to
give
it
a
try
anyway
it
pretty
dull
up
our
way
and
i
got
to
do
something
barker
tell
you
who
i
he
winked
at
lemuel
with
the
eye
not
exposed
to
harmon
and
gave
her
a
broad
frank
prepossessing
smile
well
of
course
said
harmon
smoothly
any
friend
of
barker
we
just
been
talkin
over
old
times
in
here
interrupted
the
mate
i
guess
it
was
me
shoved
that
bolt
in
i
did
want
to
have
anybody
see
me
talkin
with
him
till
i
got
some
clothes
that
would
be
a
little
more
of
a
credit
to
well
that
right
said
harmon
appreciatively
i
always
like
to
have
everybody
around
my
house
looking
neat
and
respectable
i
keep
a
house
and
i
do
have
any
but
help
and
i
expect
them
to
dress
accordingly
from
the
highest
to
the
yes
said
the
mate
that
the
way
i
felt
about
it
myself
me
and
barker
both
and
he
was
just
tellin
me
that
if
i
was
a
mind
to
give
the
elevator
a
try
he
lend
me
a
suit
of
his
very
well
then
said
harmon
if
barker
and
you
are
a
mind
to
fix
it
up
between
you
oh
we
are
said
the
mate
there
wo
be
any
trouble
about
i
do
suppose
i
need
to
stop
at
the
intelligence
office
i
presume
barker
will
show
you
how
to
work
the
elevator
he
helped
us
out
with
it
himself
at
yes
that
what
he
said
the
other
chimed
in
but
i
guess
i
better
go
and
change
my
clothes
first
well
mate
he
added
to
lemuel
ready
when
you
lemuel
rose
trembling
from
the
chair
where
he
had
been
chained
as
it
seemed
to
him
while
the
mate
and
harmon
arranged
their
affair
with
his
tacit
connivance
he
had
not
spoken
a
word
he
feared
so
much
to
open
his
lips
lest
another
lie
should
come
out
of
them
that
his
sense
of
that
danger
was
hardly
less
than
his
terror
at
the
captivity
in
which
he
found
himself
yes
said
harmon
i
look
after
the
office
till
you
get
back
barker
show
you
where
you
can
thank
you
said
the
mate
with
gratitude
that
won
upon
her
and
i
glad
she
added
that
it
a
friend
of
barker
going
to
have
the
place
we
think
everything
of
barker
well
you
ca
think
more
of
him
than
what
we
do
up
home
rejoined
the
other
with
generous
enthusiasm
in
lemuel
room
he
was
not
less
appreciative
why
mate
it
does
me
good
to
see
how
you
got
along
i
got
to
write
a
letter
home
at
once
and
tell
the
folks
what
friends
you
got
in
boston
i
do
believe
they
half
understand
he
smiled
joyously
upon
lemuel
who
stood
stock
still
with
such
despair
in
his
face
that
probably
the
wretch
pitied
him
look
here
mate
do
you
be
afraid
now
i
on
the
reform
lay
with
all
my
might
and
i
mean
business
i
ai
to
do
you
any
harm
you
bet
your
life
these
your
things
he
asked
taking
lemuel
winter
suit
from
the
hooks
where
they
hung
and
beginning
to
pull
off
his
coat
he
talked
on
while
he
changed
his
dress
i
was
led
away
and
i
got
my
or
the
other
fellow
comeuppings
for
to
blame
any
and
i
always
said
so
and
i
guess
the
judge
would
say
so
too
if
it
was
to
do
over
a
frightful
thought
stung
lemuel
to
life
the
judge
was
it
a
the
other
stopped
buttoning
lemuel
trousers
round
him
to
slap
himself
on
the
thigh
why
mate
do
you
know
enough
to
know
what
a
is
why
i
been
down
to
the
for
the
last
six
months
hai
you
never
heard
it
called
a
sea
voyage
why
we
come
off
from
a
cruise
when
we
git
back
you
do
mean
to
say
you
never
one
oh
my
goodness
groaned
lemuel
have
have
you
been
in
prison
why
of
oh
what
am
i
going
to
do
whispered
the
miserable
creature
to
himself
the
other
heard
him
why
you
hai
got
to
do
anything
i
on
the
reform
and
you
might
leave
everything
layin
around
loose
and
i
should
touch
it
fact
you
ask
the
ship
he
laughed
in
the
midst
of
his
assertions
of
good
resolutions
but
sobered
to
the
full
extent
probably
of
his
face
and
nature
and
tying
lemuel
cravat
on
at
the
glass
he
said
solemnly
mate
it
all
right
i
on
the
xxiii
lemuel
friend
entered
upon
his
duties
with
what
may
also
be
called
artistic
zeal
he
showed
a
masterly
touch
in
managing
the
elevator
from
the
first
trip
he
was
ready
cheerful
and
obliging
he
lacked
nothing
but
a
little
more
reluctance
and
a
seaside
library
novel
to
be
a
perfect
the
ladies
liked
him
at
once
he
was
so
pleasant
and
talkative
and
so
full
of
pride
in
lemuel
that
they
could
not
help
liking
him
and
several
of
them
promptly
reached
that
stage
of
confidence
where
they
told
him
as
an
old
friend
of
lemuel
they
thought
lemuel
read
too
much
and
was
going
to
kill
himself
if
he
kept
on
a
great
deal
longer
the
mate
said
he
thought
so
too
and
had
noticed
how
bad
lemuel
looked
the
minute
he
set
eyes
on
him
but
he
asked
what
was
the
use
he
had
said
everything
he
could
to
him
about
it
he
was
always
just
so
up
at
home
as
he
found
opportunity
he
did
what
he
could
to
console
lemuel
with
furtive
winks
and
nods
lemuel
dragged
absently
and
haggardly
through
the
day
in
the
evening
he
told
harmon
that
he
had
to
go
round
and
see
sewell
a
moment
it
was
then
nine
and
she
readily
assented
she
guessed
williams
he
had
told
her
his
name
was
williams
could
look
after
the
office
while
he
was
gone
williams
was
generously
glad
to
do
so
behind
harmon
smooth
large
form
he
playfully
threatened
her
with
his
hand
levelled
at
his
shoulder
but
even
this
failed
to
gladden
lemuel
it
was
nine
when
he
reached
the
minister
house
and
the
maid
had
a
visible
reluctance
at
the
door
in
owning
that
sewell
was
at
home
sewell
had
instructed
her
not
to
be
too
eagerly
candid
with
people
who
came
so
late
but
he
was
admitted
and
sewell
came
down
from
his
study
to
see
him
in
the
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
at
once
when
he
caught
sight
of
face
has
anything
gone
wrong
with
you
barker
he
could
not
help
being
moved
by
the
boy
looks
he
had
a
fleeting
wish
that
sewell
were
there
to
see
him
and
be
moved
too
and
he
prepared
himself
as
he
might
to
treat
the
trouble
which
he
now
expected
to
be
poured
out
yes
said
lemuel
i
want
to
tell
you
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
to
when
he
had
put
the
case
fully
before
the
minister
his
listener
was
aware
of
wishing
that
it
had
been
a
such
as
he
foreboded
at
first
he
drew
a
long
and
deep
breath
and
before
he
began
to
speak
he
searched
himself
for
some
comfort
or
encouragement
while
lemuel
anxiously
scanned
his
face
yes
yes
i
see
your
difficulty
he
began
making
the
futile
attempt
to
disown
any
share
in
it
but
perhaps
perhaps
it
is
so
bad
as
it
seems
perhaps
no
harm
will
come
perhaps
he
really
means
to
do
well
and
if
you
are
vigilant
in
in
keeping
him
out
of
temptation
sewell
stopped
sensible
that
he
was
not
coming
to
anything
and
rubbed
his
forehead
do
you
think
asked
lemuel
dry
mouthed
with
misery
that
i
ought
to
have
told
harmon
at
once
why
it
is
always
best
to
be
truthful
and
as
a
principle
said
the
minister
feeling
himself
somehow
dragged
from
his
moorings
then
i
had
better
do
it
yet
yes
said
sewell
and
he
paused
yes
that
is
to
say
as
the
mischief
is
done
perhaps
perhaps
there
is
no
haste
if
you
exercise
vigilance
but
if
he
has
been
in
prison
do
you
know
what
he
was
in
for
no
i
did
know
he
had
been
in
at
all
till
we
got
to
my
room
and
then
i
could
ask
him
i
was
afraid
yes
said
sewell
kindly
if
helplessly
i
was
afraid
if
i
sent
him
off
or
tried
to
that
he
would
tell
about
my
being
in
the
wayfarer
lodge
that
night
and
they
would
think
i
had
been
a
tramp
i
could
have
done
it
but
i
thought
he
might
tell
some
lie
about
me
and
they
might
get
to
know
about
the
trial
i
see
said
sewell
i
hated
to
lie
said
lemuel
piteously
but
i
seemed
to
have
there
was
another
yes
on
the
minister
tongue
he
kept
it
back
but
he
was
aware
of
an
instant
relief
in
the
speculation
the
question
presented
itself
abstractly
as
to
whether
it
was
ever
justifiable
or
excusable
to
lie
were
the
jesuitical
casuists
possibly
right
in
some
slight
shadowy
sort
he
came
back
to
lemuel
groaning
in
spirit
no
no
no
he
sighed
we
must
admit
that
you
to
lie
we
must
never
admit
a
truth
flashed
so
vividly
upon
him
that
it
seemed
almost
escape
what
worse
thing
could
have
come
from
telling
the
truth
than
has
come
from
withholding
it
and
that
would
have
been
some
sort
of
end
and
this
this
is
only
the
miserable
yes
said
lemuel
with
all
desirable
humility
but
i
could
see
it
at
oh
i
do
blame
you
i
do
blame
said
sewell
it
was
a
sore
temptation
i
blame
he
exclaimed
with
more
comprehensiveness
than
lemuel
knew
but
he
limited
his
by
adding
i
ought
to
have
told
harmon
myself
what
i
knew
of
your
history
but
i
refrained
because
i
knew
you
had
never
done
any
harm
and
i
thought
it
cruel
that
you
should
be
dishonoured
by
your
misfortunes
in
a
relation
where
you
were
usefully
and
prosperously
placed
and
so
and
so
i
did
but
perhaps
i
was
wrong
yes
i
was
wrong
i
have
only
allowed
the
burden
to
fall
more
heavily
upon
you
at
it
was
respite
for
lemuel
to
have
some
one
else
accusing
himself
and
he
did
not
refuse
to
enjoy
it
he
left
the
minister
to
wring
all
the
bitterness
he
could
for
himself
out
of
his
final
responsibility
the
drowning
man
strangles
his
rescuer
sewell
looked
up
and
loosened
his
collar
as
if
really
stifling
well
well
we
must
find
some
way
out
of
it
i
will
see
see
what
can
be
done
for
you
lemuel
recognised
his
dismissal
if
you
say
so
sewell
i
will
go
straight
back
and
tell
harmon
all
about
sewell
rose
too
no
no
there
is
no
such
haste
you
had
better
leave
it
to
me
now
i
will
see
to
it
in
the
thank
you
said
lemuel
i
hate
to
give
you
so
much
oh
said
sewell
letting
him
out
at
the
and
putting
probably
less
thought
and
meaning
into
the
polite
words
than
they
had
ever
contained
before
it
no
he
went
upstairs
to
his
study
and
found
sewell
waiting
there
well
what
david
now
what
he
feebly
echoed
yes
what
has
that
wretched
creature
come
for
now
you
may
well
call
him
a
wretched
creature
sighed
sewell
is
he
really
engaged
has
he
come
to
get
you
to
marry
him
i
think
he
rather
have
me
bury
him
at
sewell
sat
down
and
bracing
his
elbow
on
his
desk
rested
his
head
heavily
on
his
hand
well
said
his
wife
with
a
touch
of
compassion
tempering
her
curiosity
he
began
to
tell
her
what
had
happened
and
he
did
not
spare
himself
in
the
statement
of
the
case
there
you
have
the
whole
affair
now
and
a
very
pretty
affair
it
is
but
i
declare
he
concluded
i
ca
see
that
any
one
is
to
blame
for
no
one
david
well
adam
finally
of
course
or
eve
or
the
serpent
replied
the
desperate
man
seeing
him
at
this
reckless
pass
his
wife
forebore
reproach
and
asked
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
am
going
around
there
in
the
morning
to
tell
harmon
all
about
she
will
send
him
away
i
dare
and
what
will
the
poor
thing
do
goodness
i
afraid
badness
knows
it
will
drive
him
to
well
perhaps
not
perhaps
not
sighed
the
minister
at
any
rate
we
must
not
him
be
driven
to
despair
you
must
help
me
of
sewell
was
a
good
woman
and
she
liked
to
make
her
husband
feel
it
keenly
i
knew
that
it
must
come
to
that
she
said
of
course
we
must
not
let
him
be
ruined
if
harmon
insists
upon
his
going
at
once
as
i
no
doubt
she
will
you
must
bring
him
here
and
we
must
keep
him
till
he
can
find
some
other
she
waited
and
added
for
a
final
stroke
of
merciless
beneficence
he
can
have
alfred
room
and
alf
can
take
the
front
sewell
only
sighed
again
he
knew
she
did
not
mean
this
barker
went
back
to
the
albans
and
shrunk
into
as
small
space
in
the
office
as
he
could
he
pulled
a
book
before
him
and
pretended
to
read
hiding
the
side
of
his
face
toward
the
door
with
the
hand
that
supported
his
head
his
hand
was
cold
as
ice
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
his
head
were
in
a
flame
williams
came
and
looked
in
at
him
once
and
then
went
back
to
the
stool
which
he
occupied
just
outside
the
when
not
running
it
he
whistled
softly
between
his
teeth
with
intervals
of
respectful
silence
and
then
went
on
whistling
in
absence
of
any
whom
it
might
offend
suddenly
a
muffled
clamour
made
itself
heard
from
the
depths
of
the
like
that
noise
of
voices
which
is
heard
behind
the
scenes
at
the
theatre
when
an
armed
mob
is
about
to
burst
upon
the
stage
irish
tones
high
windy
and
angry
yells
and
oaths
defined
themselves
and
harmon
came
obesely
hurrying
from
the
toward
the
office
closely
followed
by
jerry
the
porter
when
upon
duty
or
as
some
of
the
boarders
contended
when
in
the
right
humour
he
blacked
the
boots
and
made
the
fires
and
carried
the
trunks
up
and
down
stairs
when
in
the
wrong
humour
he
had
sometimes
been
heard
to
swear
at
harmon
but
she
had
excused
him
in
this
eccentricity
because
she
said
he
had
been
with
her
so
long
those
who
excused
it
with
her
on
these
grounds
conjectured
arrears
of
wages
as
another
reason
for
her
patience
his
outbreaks
of
bad
temper
had
the
celtic
uncertainty
the
most
innocent
touch
excited
them
as
sometimes
the
broadest
snub
failed
to
do
so
and
no
one
could
foretell
what
direction
his
zigzag
fury
would
take
he
had
disliked
lemuel
from
the
first
and
had
chafed
at
the
subordination
into
which
he
had
necessarily
fallen
he
was
now
yelling
after
harmon
to
know
if
she
was
not
satisfied
with
that
she
must
nades
go
and
pick
up
another
and
whether
the
new
wan
was
going
to
be
too
good
to
take
prisints
of
money
for
his
worruk
from
the
boarthers
and
put
all
the
rest
of
the
help
under
the
caumpliment
of
refusin
ut
or
else
demanin
themselves
by
takin
ut
if
this
was
the
case
he
have
her
to
know
that
she
could
kape
anny
other
help
and
the
quicker
she
found
it
out
the
betther
harmon
was
trying
to
appease
him
by
promising
to
see
lemuel
at
once
and
ask
him
about
it
the
porter
raised
his
voice
an
octave
d
ye
think
i
a
loyar
domn
ye
do
ye
think
i
tellin
the
thruth
he
followed
her
to
the
little
office
whither
she
had
retreated
on
a
purely
mechanical
fulfilment
of
her
promise
to
speak
to
lemuel
and
crowded
in
upon
them
there
here
he
is
now
he
roared
in
his
frenzy
he
too
good
to
take
the
money
that
offered
to
he
too
good
to
be
waither
he
wannts
to
play
the
gintleman
he
thinks
too
good
to
do
what
the
other
servants
do
that
been
tin
times
as
lahng
in
the
house
at
the
noise
some
of
the
ladies
came
hurrying
out
of
the
public
parlour
to
see
what
the
trouble
was
the
opened
and
berry
entered
with
the
two
they
involuntarily
joined
the
group
of
terrified
ladies
what
the
row
demanded
berry
is
jerry
on
the
kick
no
one
answered
lemuel
stood
pale
and
silent
fronting
the
porter
who
was
shaking
his
fist
in
his
face
he
had
not
heard
anything
definite
in
the
outrage
that
assailed
him
he
only
conjectured
that
it
was
exposure
of
williams
character
and
the
story
of
his
own
career
in
boston
why
do
you
fire
him
out
of
there
barker
called
the
do
be
afraid
of
him
lemuel
remained
motionless
but
his
glance
sought
the
pitying
eyes
of
the
assembled
women
and
then
dropped
before
the
amaze
that
looked
at
him
from
those
of
miss
carver
the
porter
kept
roaring
out
his
infamies
berry
spoke
again
mrs
harmon
do
you
want
that
fellow
in
there
no
goodness
knows
i
do
all
berry
swung
the
open
with
his
left
hand
and
seemed
with
the
same
gesture
to
lay
his
clutch
upon
the
porter
collar
fire
him
out
myself
he
exclaimed
and
with
a
few
swiftly
successive
jerks
and
bumps
the
burly
shape
of
the
porter
was
shot
into
the
night
i
want
you
to
get
me
an
officer
jerry
he
said
putting
his
head
out
after
him
there
been
a
blackguard
makin
a
row
here
never
mind
your
hat
go
oh
my
good
gracious
berry
gasped
harmon
what
have
you
done
if
it
back
pay
harmon
we
pass
round
the
hat
you
be
troubled
that
fellow
was
fit
to
be
in
a
decent
berry
stopped
a
moment
and
looked
at
lemuel
the
did
not
look
at
him
at
all
they
passed
on
upstairs
with
berry
the
other
ladies
remained
to
question
and
to
comment
nephew
to
whom
the
uproar
seemed
to
have
penetrated
in
his
basement
came
up
and
heard
the
story
from
them
he
was
quite
decided
he
said
that
berry
had
done
right
he
said
that
he
was
tired
of
having
folks
damn
his
aunt
up
hill
and
down
dale
and
that
if
jerry
had
kept
on
a
great
deal
longer
he
would
have
said
something
to
him
himself
about
it
the
ladies
justified
him
in
the
stand
he
took
they
returned
to
the
parlour
to
talk
it
all
over
and
he
went
back
to
his
basement
harmon
in
tears
retired
to
her
room
and
lemuel
was
left
standing
alone
in
his
office
the
mate
stole
softly
to
him
from
the
background
of
the
elevator
where
he
had
kept
himself
in
safety
during
the
outbreak
look
here
mate
this
thing
been
about
your
ringin
me
in
here
oh

lemuel
huskily
entreated
well
that
what
i

i
do

here
and
git

into
no
more

worse
you

well
if
you
say
so
he
went
back
to
his
elevator
and
lemuel
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
dropped
his
face
upon
his
arms
there
toward
eleven
evans
came
in
and
looked
at
him
but
without
speaking
he
must
have
concluded
that
he
was
asleep
he
went
upstairs
but
after
a
while
he
came
down
again
and
stopped
again
at
the
office
door
and
looked
in
on
the
haggard
boy
hesitating
as
if
for
the
best
words
barker
berry
has
been
telling
me
about
your
difficulty
here
i
know
all
about
you
from
lemuel
stared
at
him
and
i
will
stand
your
friend
whatever
people
think
and
i
do
blame
you
for
not
wanting
to
be
beaten
by
that
ruffian
you
could
have
stood
no
chance
against
him
and
if
you
had
thrashed
him
it
would
have
been
a
great
i
wish
he
had
killed
me
said
lemuel
from
his
throat
oh
no
that
foolish
said
the
elder
with
patient
sad
kindness
who
knows
whether
death
is
the
end
of
trouble
we
must
live
things
down
not
die
them
he
put
his
arm
caressingly
across
the
shoulder
i
can
never
live
this
down
said
lemuel
he
added
passionately
i
wish
i
could
die
no
said
evans
you
must
cheer
up
think
of
next
saturday
it
will
soon
be
here
and
then
you
be
astonished
that
you
felt
so
bad
on
he
gave
lemuel
a
parting
pressure
with
his
arm
and
turned
to
go
upstairs
at
the
same
moment
the
figure
of
harmon
nephew
distracted
violent
burst
up
through
the
door
leading
to
the
basement
good
heavens
exclaimed
the
editor
is
harmon
going
to
kick
the
house
is
on
fire
yelled
the
apparition
a
thick
cloud
of
smoke
gushed
out
of
the
and
poured
into
the
hall
which
it
seemed
to
fill
instantly
it
grew
denser
and
in
another
instant
a
wild
hubbub
began
the
people
appeared
from
every
quarter
and
ran
into
the
street
where
some
of
the
ladies
began
calling
up
at
the
windows
to
those
who
were
still
in
their
rooms
a
stout
little
old
lady
came
to
an
open
window
and
paid
out
hand
over
hand
a
small
cable
on
which
she
meant
to
descend
to
the
pavement
she
had
carried
this
rope
about
with
her
many
years
against
the
exigency
to
which
she
was
now
applying
it
within
the
halls
and
the
stairway
became
the
scene
of
frantic
encounter
between
wives
and
husbands
rushing
down
to
save
themselves
and
then
rushing
back
to
save
their
forgotten
friends
many
appeared
in
the
simple
white
in
which
they
had
left
their
beds
with
the
addition
of
such
shawls
or
rugs
as
chance
suggested
a
house
was
opened
to
the
fugitives
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
the
crowd
that
had
collected
could
not
repress
its
applause
when
one
of
them
escaped
from
the
and
shot
across
it
applauded
impartially
men
women
and
children
and
absorbed
in
the
spectacle
no
one
sounded
the
the
department
began
to
be
severely
condemned
among
the
bystanders
before
the
engines
appeared
most
of
the
ladies
in
their
escape
or
their
purpose
of
rescue
tried
each
to
possess
herself
of
lemuel
and
keep
him
solely
in
her
interest
mr
barker
barker
barker
was
called
for
in
various
sopranos
and
contraltos
till
an
outsider
took
up
the
cry
and
shouted
barker
barker
speech
speech
this
made
him
very
popular
with
the
crowd
who
in
their
enjoyment
of
the
fugitives
were
unable
to
regard
the
fire
seriously
a
momentary
diversion
was
caused
by
an
elderly
gentleman
who
came
to
the
completely
dressed
except
that
he
was
in
his
stockings
and
demanded
jerry
the
humourist
who
had
called
for
a
speech
from
lemuel
volunteered
the
statement
that
jerry
had
just
gone
round
the
corner
to
see
a
man
i
want
him
said
the
old
gentleman
savagely
i
want
my
boots
i
ca
go
about
in
my
cries
for
jerry
followed
but
in
fact
the
porter
had
forgotten
all
his
grudges
and
enmities
he
had
reappeared
in
perfect
temper
and
had
joined
lemuel
and
berry
in
helping
to
get
the
women
and
children
out
of
the
burning
house
the
police
had
set
a
guard
at
the
door
in
whom
lemuel
recognised
the
friendly
old
officer
who
had
arrested
him
all
out
asked
the
policeman
the
smoke
which
had
reddened
and
reddened
was
now
a
thin
veil
drawn
over
the
volume
of
flame
that
burned
strongly
and
steadily
up
the
well
of
the
elevator
and
darted
its
tongues
out
to
lick
the
framework
without
the
heat
was
intense
harmon
came
panting
and
weeping
from
the
with
some
unimportant
pieces
of
silver
driven
forward
by
jerry
and
her
nephew
they
met
the
firemen
come
at
last
and
pulling
in
their
hose
who
began
to
play
upon
the
flames
the
steam
filled
the
place
with
a
dense
mist
lemuel
heard
berry
ask
him
through
the
fog
barker
where
old
evans
oh
i
do
know
he
lamented
back
he
must
have
gone
up
to
get
he
made
a
dash
towards
the
stairs
a
fireman
caught
him
and
pulled
him
back
you
ca
go
up
smoke
thick
as
hell
up
but
lemuel
pulled
away
and
shot
up
the
stairs
he
heard
the
firemen
stop
berry
you
ca
go
i
tell
you
who
runnin
this
fire
anyway
i
like
to
know
he
ran
along
the
corridor
which
evans
apartment
opened
upon
there
was
not
much
smoke
there
it
had
drawn
up
the
as
if
in
a
chimney
he
burst
into
the
apartment
and
ran
to
the
inner
room
where
he
had
once
caught
a
glimpse
of
evans
sitting
by
the
window
evans
stood
leaning
against
the
wall
with
his
hand
at
his
breast
he
panted
help
her
help
where
she
where
she
demanded
lemuel
she
came
from
an
alcove
in
the
room
holding
a
handkerchief
drenched
with
cologne
in
her
hand
which
she
passed
to
her
husband
face
are

now
can

me
i
i
all

said
evans
she
turned
to
lemuel
mr
evans
fainted
but
he
is
better
she
took
his
hand
with
a
tender
tranquillity
that
ignored
all
danger
or
even
excitement
and
gently
chafed
it
but
come
come
cried
lemuel
do
you
know
the
house
is
on
fire
yes
i
know
it
she
replied
we
must
get
evans
down
you
must
help
lemuel
had
seldom
seen
her
before
but
he
had
so
long
heard
and
talked
of
her
hopeless
invalidism
that
she
was
like
one
risen
from
the
dead
in
her
sudden
strength
and
courage
and
he
stared
at
the
miracle
of
her
restoration
it
was
she
who
claimed
and
bore
the
greater
share
of
the
burden
in
getting
her
husband
away
he
was
helpless
but
in
the
open
air
he
caught
his
breath
more
fully
and
at
last
could
tremulously
find
his
way
out
of
the
sympathetic
crowd
get
a
carriage
she
said
to
lemuel
and
then
she
added
as
it
drove
up
and
she
gave
an
address
i
can
manage
him
evans
weakly
pressed
lemuel
hand
from
the
seat
to
which
he
had
helped
him
and
the
hack
drove
away
lemuel
looked
crazily
after
it
a
moment
and
then
returned
to
the
burning
house
berry
called
to
him
from
the
top
of
the
outside
steps
barker
have

seen
that
partner
of
yours
lemuel
ran
up
to
him
no

berry

a
lemuel
followed
him
upstairs
to
see
if
he
could
find
williams
the
steam
had
ascended
and
filled
the
upper
halls
little
cascades
of
water
poured
down
the
stairs
falling
from
step
to
step
the
long
strips
of
carpeting
in
the
corridors
swam
in
the
deluge
which
the
hose
had
poured
into
the
building
and
a
rain
of
heavy
drops
burst
through
the
ceilings
most
of
the
stood
open
as
the
people
had
flung
them
wide
in
their
rush
for
life
at
the
door
of
berry
room
a
figure
appeared
which
he
promptly
seized
by
the
throat

hurry

pushed
it
into
the
room

had
no
choice
he
held
williams
by
the
arms
while
berry
went
through
him
as
he
called
the
search
he
found
upon
him
whatever
small
articles
of
value
there
had
been
in
his
room
the
thief
submitted
without
a
struggle
without
a
murmur
berry
turned
scornfully
to
lemuel
this
a
friend
of
yours
barker
still
the
thief
did
not
speak
but
he
looked
at
lemuel
yes
he
dryly
gasped
well
said
berry
staring
fiercely
at
him
for
a
moment
if
it
for
something
old
evans
said
to
me
about
you
a
little
while
ago
hand
you
both
over
to
the
williams
seemed
to
bear
the
threat
with
philosophic
resignation
but
lemuel
shrank
back
in
terror
berry
laughed
why
you
are
his
pal
go
along
i
get
jerry
to
attend
to
lemuel
slunk
downstairs
with
williams
look
here
mate
said
the
rogue
i
guess
i
used
you
just
lemuel
expected
himself
to
cast
the
thief
off
with
bitter
rejection
but
he
heard
himself
saying
hopelessly
go
away
and
try
to
behave
yourself
and
then
he
saw
the
thief
make
the
most
of
the
favour
of
heaven
and
vanish
through
the
crowd
he
would
have
liked
to
steal
away
too
but
he
remained
and
began
mechanically
helping
again
wherever
he
saw
help
needed
by
and
by
berry
came
out
lemuel
thought
that
he
would
tell
some
policeman
to
arrest
him
but
he
went
away
without
speaking
to
any
one
in
an
hour
the
firemen
had
finished
their
share
of
the
havoc
and
had
saved
the
building
they
had
kept
the
fire
to
the
and
the
adjoining
and
but
for
the
water
they
had
poured
into
the
place
the
ladies
might
have
returned
to
their
rooms
which
were
quite
untouched
by
the
flames
as
it
was
lemuel
joined
with
jerry
in
fetching
such
things
to
them
as
their
needs
or
fancies
suggested
the
refugees
across
the
way
were
finally
clothed
by
their
efforts
and
were
able
to
quit
their
covert
indistinguishable
in
dress
from
any
of
the
other
boarders
the
crowd
began
to
go
about
its
business
the
engines
had
disappeared
from
the
little
street
with
exultant
shrieks
in
the
morning
the
insurance
companies
would
send
their
workmen
to
sweep
out
the
extinct
volcano
and
mop
up
the
shrunken
deluge
preparatory
to
ascertaining
the
extent
of
the
damage
done
in
the
meantime
the
police
kept
the
boys
and
loafers
out
of
the
building
and
the
order
that
begins
to
establish
itself
as
soon
as
chaos
is
confessed
took
possession
of
the
ruin
but
it
was
all
the
same
a
ruin
and
a
calamitous
conclusion
for
the
time
being
the
place
that
had
been
in
its
grotesque
and
insufficient
fashion
a
home
for
so
many
homeless
people
was
uninhabitable
even
the
harmons
could
not
go
back
to
it
the
boarders
had
all
scattered
but
harmon
lingered
dwelling
volubly
upon
the
scene
of
disaster
she
did
not
do
much
else
she
was
not
without
a
just
pride
in
it
but
she
was
not
puffed
up
by
all
the
sympathy
and
consolation
that
had
been
offered
her
she
thought
of
others
in
the
midst
of
her
own
troubles
and
she
said
to
lemuel
who
had
remained
working
with
jerry
under
her
direction
in
putting
together
such
things
as
she
felt
she
must
take
away
with
her
well
i
do
know
as
i
feel
much
worse
about
myself
than
i
do
about
poor
evans
why
i
got
the
ticket
in
my
pocket
now
that
he
gave
me
for
the
wednesday
matinee
i
do
wonder
how
he
gettin
along
i
guess
they
got
you
to
thank
if
they
alive
to
tell
the
tale
what
you
do
to
get
that
woman
out
alive
lemuel
looked
blankly
at
her
and
did
not
answer
and
evans
too
you
must
have
had
your
hands
full
and
that
what
i
told
the
reporters
but
i
told
i
guessed
you
be
equal
to
it
if
any
one
would
why
i
do
suppose
evans
has
been
out
of
her
room
for
a
month
or
hardly
stepped
her
foot
to
the
floor
well
i
do
want
to
see
many
people
look
as
he
did
when
you
first
got
him
out
of
the
well
i
do
know
as
i
want
to
see
many
more
fires
where
i
live
said
her
nephew
as
if
with
the
wish
to
be
a
little
more
accurate
jerry
asked
lemuel
to
watch
harmon
goods
while
he
went
for
a
carriage
and
said
sir
to
him
it
seemed
to
lemuel
that
this
respect
and
harmon
unmerited
praises
together
with
the
doom
that
was
secretly
upon
him
would
drive
him
wild
xxiv
the
evening
after
the
fire
sewell
sat
talking
it
over
with
her
husband
in
the
light
of
the
newspaper
reports
which
made
very
much
more
of
lemuel
part
in
it
than
she
liked
the
reporters
had
flattered
the
popular
love
of
the
heroic
in
using
harmon
version
of
his
exploits
and
represented
him
as
having
been
most
efficient
and
daring
throughout
and
especially
so
in
regard
to
the
evanses
well
that
does
differ
materially
from
what
they
told
us
themselves
said
sewell
you
know
very
well
david
retorted
his
wife
that
there
have
been
the
least
danger
at
any
time
and
when
he
helped
her
to
get
evans
downstairs
the
fire
was
nearly
all
very
well
then
he
would
have
saved
their
lives
if
it
had
been
necessary
it
was
a
case
of
potential
heroism
that
contained
all
the
elements
of
sewell
could
not
deny
this
but
she
was
not
satisfied
she
was
silent
a
moment
before
she
asked
what
do
you
suppose
that
wretched
creature
will
do
now
i
think
very
likely
he
will
come
to
me
answered
sewell
i
dare
the
bell
rang
and
i
suppose
that
he
now
they
listened
and
heard
miss
vane
voice
at
the
door
asking
for
them
sewell
ran
down
the
stairs
and
kissed
her
oh
i
glad
you
came
is
it
wonderful
i
just
come
from
them
and
she
taking
the
whole
care
of
him
as
if
he
had
always
been
the
sick
one
and
she
strong
and
what
do
you
mean
lucy
he
is
ill
who
is
what
are
you
talking
about
about
evans
oh
said
miss
vane
with
cold
toleration
she
arrived
at
the
study
door
and
gave
sewell
her
hand
i
scarcely
knew
him
you
know
i
only
met
him
casually
here
i
come
to
see
she
added
nervously
if
you
know
where
lemuel
is
sewell
have
you
seen
anything
of
him
since
the
fire
how
nobly
he
behaved
but
i
never
saw
anything
he
was
equal
to
mrs
sewell
objects
to
his
saving
human
life
said
sewell
not
able
to
deny
himself
i
do
see
how
you
can
take
the
slightest
interest
in
him
began
sewell
saying
a
little
more
than
she
meant
you
would
my
dear
returned
miss
vane
if
you
had
wronged
him
as
i
or
as
i
said
sewell
i
thankful
i
have
then
said
his
wife
it
seems
to
me
that
there
nothing
else
of
him
as
to
his
noble
behaviour
it
possible
you
believe
those
newspaper
accounts
he
did
save
any
life
there
was
no
danger
miss
vane
preoccupied
with
her
own
ideal
of
the
facts
stared
at
her
without
replying
and
then
turned
to
sewell
i
want
to
find
him
and
ask
him
to
stay
with
me
till
he
can
get
something
else
to
sewell
eyebrows
arched
themselves
involuntarily
sibyl
has
gone
to
new
york
for
a
fortnight
i
shall
be
quite
alone
in
the
house
and
i
shall
be
very
glad
of
his
company
she
explained
to
the
eyebrows
while
ignoring
them
her
chin
quivered
a
little
as
she
added
i
shall
be
of
his
company
i
wish
him
to
understand
that
he
is
my
i
suppose
i
shall
see
him
soon
said
sewell
and
i
will
give
him
your
will
you
tell
him
persisted
miss
vane
a
little
hysterically
that
if
he
is
in
any
way
embarrassed
i
insist
upon
his
coming
to
me
immediately
at
sewell
smiled
i
know
that
i
rather
ridiculous
said
miss
vane
smiling
in
sympathy
and
i
do
blame
sewell
for
not
entering
into
my
feelings
nobody
could
who
had
felt
the
peculiar
lemuel
i
do
imagine
he
embarrassed
in
any
way
said
sewell
he
seems
to
have
the
gift
of
lighting
on
his
feet
but
i
tell
him
how
peremptory
you
are
miss
well
upon
my
word
cried
sewell
when
miss
vane
had
taken
leave
of
them
in
an
exaltation
precluding
every
recurrent
attempt
to
enlighten
her
as
to
the
true
proportions
of
lemuel
part
in
the
fire
i
really
believe
people
like
to
be
made
fools
of
why
did
tell
her
david
that
he
had
done
nothing
what
would
have
been
the
use
she
has
her
own
theory
of
the
affair
besides
he
did
do
something
he
did
his
duty
and
my
experience
is
that
it
no
small
thing
to
do
it
was
his
fault
that
he
did
do
he
waited
some
days
for
lemuel
to
come
to
him
and
he
inquired
each
time
he
went
to
see
the
evanses
if
they
knew
where
he
was
but
they
had
not
heard
of
him
since
the
night
of
the
fire
it
his
shyness
said
evans
i
can
understand
how
if
he
thought
he
had
put
me
under
an
obligation
he
would
come
near
me
and
evans
was
to
go
out
of
town
for
a
little
while
the
proprietors
of
the
insisted
upon
his
taking
a
rest
and
they
behaved
handsomely
about
his
salary
he
did
not
want
to
go
but
his
wife
got
him
away
finally
after
he
had
failed
in
two
or
three
attempts
at
writing
lemuel
did
not
appear
to
sewell
till
the
evening
of
the
day
when
the
evanses
left
town
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
waited
till
they
were
gone
so
that
he
could
not
be
urged
to
visit
them
at
first
the
minister
scolded
him
a
little
for
his
neglect
but
lemuel
said
he
had
heard
about
them
and
knew
they
were
getting
along
all
right
he
looked
as
if
he
had
not
been
getting
along
very
well
himself
his
face
was
thin
and
had
an
air
at
once
dogged
and
apprehensive
he
abruptly
left
talking
of
evans
and
said
i
do
know
as
you
heard
what
happened
that
night
before
the
fire
just
after
i
got
back
from
your
house
no
i
lemuel
stopped
then
he
related
briefly
and
cleanly
the
whole
affair
sewell
interrupting
him
from
time
to
time
with
murmurs
of
sympathy
and
tchk
tchk
tchk
and
shocking
shocking
at
the
end
he
said
i
had
hoped
somehow
that
the
general
calamity
had
swallowed
up
your
particular
trouble
in
it
though
i
do
know
that
general
calamities
ever
do
that
with
particular
troubles
he
added
more
to
himself
than
to
lemuel
and
he
put
the
idea
away
for
some
future
sermon
mr
evans
stopped
and
said
something
to
me
that
night
he
said
we
had
to
live
things
down
and
not
die
them
down
he
wanted
i
should
wait
till
saturday
before
i
was
sure
that
i
could
get
through
tuesday
he
said
how
did
we
know
that
death
was
the
end
of
trouble
yes
said
the
minister
with
a
smile
of
fondness
for
his
friend
that
was
like
evans
all
i
forget
those
things
said
lemuel
they
been
in
my
head
ever
since
if
it
had
been
for
them
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
he
stopped
and
after
a
moment
inattention
sewell
perceived
that
he
wished
to
be
asked
something
more
i
hope
he
said
that
nothing
more
has
been
going
wrong
with
you
and
as
he
asked
this
he
laid
his
hand
affectionately
on
the
young
man
shoulder
just
as
evans
had
done
lemuel
eyes
dimmed
and
his
breath
thickened
what
has
become
of
the
person
the
discharged
convict
i
guess
i
had
better
tell
you
he
said
and
he
told
him
of
the
adventure
with
berry
and
williams
sewell
listened
in
silence
and
then
seemed
quite
at
a
loss
what
to
say
but
lemuel
saw
that
he
was
deeply
afflicted
at
last
he
asked
lifting
his
eyes
anxiously
to
sewell
do
you
think
i
did
wrong
to
say
the
thief
was
a
friend
of
mine
and
get
him
off
that
way
that
a
very
difficult
question
sighed
sewell
you
had
a
duty
to
yes
i
thought
of
that
since
if
i
had
been
in
your
place
i
afraid
i
should
be
glad
not
to
have
thought
of
it
in
time
and
i
afraid
i
glad
that
as
it
is
it
too
late
but
does
it
involve
you
with
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
young
man
yes
i
presume
it
does
said
lemuel
i
shall
have
to
go
back
to
willoughby
pastures
asked
sewell
with
not
so
much
faith
in
that
panacea
for
lemuel
troubles
as
he
had
once
had
no
to
some
other
town
do
you
know
of
anything
i
could
get
to
do
in
new
york
oh
no
no
said
the
minister
you
need
let
this
banish
you
we
must
seek
this
young
berry
out
and
explain
the
matter
to
then
you
have
to
tell
him
all
about
me
yes
why
not
lemuel
was
silent
and
looked
down
in
the
meantime
pursued
the
minister
i
have
a
message
for
you
from
miss
vane
she
has
heard
as
we
all
have
of
your
behaviour
during
the
fire
it
was
anything
lemuel
interrupted
there
was
the
least
danger
and
evans
did
it
all
herself
anyway
it
made
me
sick
to
see
how
the
papers
had
it
it
a
shame
sewell
smiled
i
afraid
you
could
make
miss
vane
think
so
but
i
can
understand
what
you
mean
she
has
never
felt
quite
easy
about
the
way
the
terms
on
which
she
parted
with
you
she
has
spoken
to
me
several
times
of
it
and
ah
expressed
her
regret
and
now
knowing
that
you
have
been
interrupted
in
your
life
she
is
anxious
to
have
you
come
to
her
an
angry
flash
lighted
up
lemuel
face
i
could
go
back
there
i
would
do
any
such
work
i
do
mean
that
sewell
hastened
to
say
miss
vane
wished
me
to
ask
you
to
come
as
her
guest
until
you
could
find
something
miss
sibyl
vane
has
gone
to
new
york
i
very
much
obliged
to
her
said
lemuel
but
i
should
want
to
give
her
so
much
trouble
or
any
one
i
i
liked
her
very
much
and
i
should
want
she
should
think
i
did
appreciate
her
i
will
tell
her
said
the
minister
i
had
no
great
hope
you
would
see
your
way
to
accepting
it
but
she
will
be
glad
to
know
that
you
received
he
added
rather
interrogatively
than
affirmatively
in
the
right
oh
yes
said
lemuel
please
to
tell
her
i
thank
you
said
sewell
with
bland
vagueness
i
do
know
that
asked
yet
where
you
are
staying
at
present
i
at
nash
canary
place
harmon
went
there
oh
and
are
you
looking
forward
to
rejoining
her
in
a
new
place
i
do
know
as
i
am
i
do
know
as
i
should
want
to
go
into
an
hotel
sewell
manifested
a
little
embarrassment
well
you
wo
forget
your
promise
to
let
me
be
of
use
to
you
pecuniarily
if
you
should
be
in
need
of
a
small
advance
at
any
oh
no
but
i
got
enough
money
for
a
while
yet
till
i
can
get
something
to
he
rose
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
said
i
do
know
as
i
want
you
should
say
anything
to
that
fellow
about
me
to
berry
i
oh
certainly
not
said
sewell
if
you
do
wish
whatever
it
was
in
that
reticent
and
elusive
soul
which
prompted
his
request
the
minister
now
felt
that
he
could
not
know
but
perhaps
the
pang
that
lemuel
inflicted
on
himself
had
as
much
transport
as
anguish
in
it
he
believed
that
he
had
for
ever
cut
himself
off
from
the
companionship
that
seemed
highest
and
holiest
on
earth
to
him
he
should
never
see
that
girl
again
berry
must
have
told
miss
swan
and
long
before
this
miss
carver
had
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
him
as
the
accomplice
of
a
thief
but
he
proudly
said
to
himself
that
he
must
let
it
all
go
for
if
he
had
not
been
a
thief
he
had
been
a
beggar
and
a
menial
he
had
come
out
of
a
hovel
at
home
and
his
mother
went
about
like
a
scarecrow
and
it
mattered
little
what
kind
of
shame
she
remembered
him
in
he
thought
of
her
perpetually
now
and
in
those
dialogues
which
we
hold
in
reverie
with
the
people
we
think
much
about
he
talked
with
her
all
day
long
at
first
when
he
began
to
do
this
it
seemed
a
wrong
to
statira
but
now
since
the
other
was
lost
to
him
beyond
other
approach
he
gave
himself
freely
up
to
the
mystical
colloquies
he
held
with
her
as
the
devotee
abandons
himself
to
imagined
converse
with
a
saint
besides
if
he
was
in
love
with
statira
he
was
not
in
love
with
jessie
that
he
had
made
clear
to
himself
for
his
feeling
toward
her
was
wholly
different
most
of
the
time
in
these
communings
he
was
with
her
in
her
own
home
down
at
corbitant
where
he
fancied
she
had
gone
after
the
catastrophe
at
the
albans
and
he
sat
there
with
her
on
a
porch
at
the
front
door
which
she
had
once
described
to
him
and
looked
out
under
the
silver
poplars
at
the
vessels
in
the
bay
he
formed
himself
some
image
of
it
all
from
pictures
of
the
seaside
which
he
had
seen
and
there
were
times
when
he
tried
to
go
back
with
her
into
the
life
she
had
led
there
as
a
child
perhaps
his
ardent
guesses
at
this
were
as
near
reality
as
anything
that
could
be
made
to
appear
for
after
her
mother
and
brothers
and
sisters
had
died
out
of
the
wide
old
house
her
existence
there
was
as
lonely
as
if
she
had
been
a
little
ghost
haunting
it
she
had
inherited
her
mother
temperament
with
her
father
constitution
she
was
the
child
born
to
his
last
long
absence
at
sea
and
her
last
solitude
at
home
when
he
returned
he
found
his
wife
dead
and
his
maiden
sister
caring
for
the
child
in
the
desolate
house
this
sister
of
captain
carver
had
been
disappointed
as
the
phrase
is
when
a
young
girl
another
girl
had
won
her
lover
from
her
her
disappointment
had
hardened
her
to
the
perception
of
the
neighbours
and
by
a
strange
perversion
of
the
sympathies
and
faculties
she
had
turned
from
gossip
and
censure
from
religion
and
from
all
the
sources
of
comfort
that
the
bruised
heart
of
corbitant
naturally
turned
to
and
found
such
consolation
as
came
to
her
in
books
that
is
to
say
romances
and
especially
the
romances
that
celebrated
and
deified
such
sorrow
as
her
own
she
had
been
a
pretty
little
thing
when
young
and
jessie
remembered
her
as
pretty
in
her
early
old
age
at
heart
she
must
still
have
been
young
when
her
hair
was
grey
for
she
made
a
friend
and
companion
of
the
child
and
they
fed
upon
her
romances
together
when
the
aunt
died
the
child
who
had
known
no
mother
but
her
was
stricken
with
a
grief
so
deep
and
wild
that
at
first
her
life
and
then
her
mind
was
feared
for
to
get
her
away
from
the
associations
and
influences
of
the
place
her
father
sent
her
to
school
in
the
western
part
of
the
state
where
she
met
madeline
swan
and
formed
one
of
those
friendships
which
are
like
passions
between
young
girls
during
her
long
absence
her
father
married
again
and
she
was
called
home
to
his
deathbed
he
was
dead
when
she
arrived
he
had
left
a
will
that
made
her
dependent
on
her
stepmother
when
madeline
swan
wrote
to
announce
that
she
was
coming
to
boston
to
study
art
jessie
carver
had
no
trouble
in
arranging
with
her
stepmother
by
the
sacrifice
of
her
final
claim
on
her
estate
to
join
her
friend
there
with
a
little
sum
of
money
on
which
she
was
to
live
till
she
should
begin
to
earn
something
her
life
had
been
a
series
of
romantic
episodes
madeline
said
that
if
it
could
be
written
out
it
would
be
fascinating
but
she
went
to
work
very
practically
and
worked
hard
she
had
not
much
feeling
for
colour
but
she
drew
better
than
her
friend
and
what
she
hoped
to
do
was
to
learn
to
illustrate
books
one
evening
after
a
day
of
reveries
of
jessie
lemuel
went
to
see
statira
she
and
grier
were
both
very
gay
and
made
him
very
welcome
they
had
tea
for
him
statira
tried
all
her
little
arts
and
grier
told
some
things
that
had
happened
in
the
he
could
not
help
laughing
at
them
they
were
really
very
funny
but
he
felt
somehow
that
it
was
all
a
preparation
for
something
else
at
last
the
two
girls
made
a
set
at
him
as
grier
called
it
and
tried
to
talk
him
into
their
old
scheme
of
going
to
wait
on
table
at
some
of
the
country
hotels
or
the
seaside
they
urged
that
now
while
he
was
out
of
a
place
it
was
just
the
time
to
look
up
a
chance
he
refused
at
first
kindly
and
at
last
angrily
and
he
would
have
gone
away
in
this
mood
if
statira
had
not
said
that
she
would
never
say
another
word
to
him
about
it
and
hung
upon
his
neck
while
grier
looked
on
in
sullen
resentment
he
came
away
sick
and
heavy
at
heart
he
said
to
himself
that
they
would
be
willing
to
drag
him
into
the
mire
they
had
no
pride
they
had
no
sense
they
did
not
know
anything
and
they
could
not
learn
he
tried
to
get
away
from
them
to
miss
carver
in
his
thoughts
but
the
place
where
he
had
left
her
was
vacant
and
he
could
not
conjure
her
back
out
of
the
void
he
was
haunted
by
a
look
of
grieving
reproach
and
wonder
from
her
eyes
xxv
that
evening
sewell
went
to
see
an
old
parishioner
of
his
who
lived
on
the
hill
and
who
among
his
eccentricities
had
the
habit
of
occupying
his
city
house
all
summer
long
while
his
family
flitted
with
other
people
of
fashion
to
the
seashore
that
year
they
talked
of
taking
a
cottage
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
sold
their
own
cottage
at
nahant
in
a
day
of
narrow
things
now
past
the
ladies
urged
that
he
ought
to
come
with
them
and
not
think
of
staying
in
boston
now
that
he
had
a
trouble
of
the
eyes
which
had
befallen
him
and
boston
would
be
so
dull
if
he
could
not
get
about
freely
and
read
as
usual
he
answered
that
he
would
rather
be
blind
in
boston
than
telescopic
at
beverly
or
any
other
summer
resort
and
that
as
for
the
want
of
proper
care
which
they
urged
he
did
not
think
he
should
lack
in
his
own
house
if
they
left
him
where
he
could
reach
a
bell
his
youngest
daughter
a
lively
little
blonde
laughed
with
a
cousin
of
his
who
was
present
and
his
wife
decorously
despaired
the
discussion
of
the
topic
was
rather
premature
for
they
were
not
thinking
of
going
to
beverly
before
middle
of
may
if
they
took
the
cottage
but
an
accident
had
precipitated
it
and
they
were
having
it
out
as
people
do
each
party
in
the
hope
that
the
other
would
yield
if
kept
at
long
enough
before
the
time
of
final
decision
came
do
you
think
said
the
husband
and
father
who
looked
a
whimsical
tyrant
at
the
worst
but
was
probably
no
easier
to
manage
for
his
whimsicality
that
i
am
going
to
fly
in
the
face
of
prosperity
and
begin
to
do
as
other
people
wish
because
i
pecuniarily
able
to
do
as
i
please
the
little
blonde
rose
decisively
from
the
low
chair
where
she
had
been
sitting
if
papa
has
begun
to
reason
about
it
we
may
as
well
yield
the
point
for
the
present
mamma
come
lily
let
us
leave
him
to
cousin
oh
but
i
say
cried
cousin
charles
if
i
to
stay
and
fight
it
out
with
him
i
got
to
know
which
side
i
you
on
the
right
side
said
the
young
lady
over
her
shoulder
you
always
are
cousin
cousin
charles
in
the
attempt
to
kiss
his
hand
toward
his
flatterer
pulled
his
glasses
off
his
nose
by
their
cord
bromfield
he
said
i
do
see
but
this
commits
me
against
and
then
the
ladies
having
withdrawn
the
two
men
put
on
that
business
air
with
which
our
sex
tries
to
atone
to
itself
for
having
unbent
to
the
lighter
minds
of
the
other
heaven
knows
what
women
do
when
the
men
with
whom
they
have
been
talking
go
away
if
you
should
happen
to
stay
in
town
continued
the
cousin
treacherously
i
shall
be
very
glad
for
i
do
know
but
i
shall
be
here
the
greater
part
of
the
summer
i
shall
stay
said
the
other
but
there
wo
be
anything
casual
about
what
do
you
hear
from
tom
asked
the
cousin
feeling
about
on
the
mantel
for
a
match
he
was
a
handsome
old
fellow
whose
breath
came
in
quick
sighs
with
this
light
exertion
he
had
a
blond
complexion
and
what
was
left
of
his
hair
a
sort
of
ethereal
down
on
the
top
of
his
head
and
some
cherished
fringes
at
the
temples
was
turning
the
yellowish
grey
that
blond
hair
becomes
the
other
gentleman
stretched
at
ease
in
a
deep
chair
with
one
leg
propped
on
a
cricket
had
the
distinction
of
long
forms
which
the
years
had
left
in
their
youthful
gracility
his
moustache
had
been
allowed
to
droop
over
the
handsome
mouth
whose
teeth
were
beginning
to
go
they
on
the
other
side
of
the
clock
he
said
referring
to
the
matches
he
added
with
another
glance
at
his
relative
charles
you
ought
to
bant
it
beginning
to
affect
your
your
memory
going
bromfield
but
they
say
there
a
new
system
that
allows
you
to
eat
everything
i
waiting
for
that
in
the
meantime
i
gone
back
to
my
they
cut
mine
off
sighed
the
other
does
it
affect
your
heart
not
a
bit
but
what
do
you
do
now
you
ca
smoke
and
your
eyes
have
given
out
i
bore
myself
i
had
a
letter
from
tom
yesterday
said
the
sufferer
returning
to
the
question
that
his
cousin
obesity
had
diverted
him
from
he
coming
on
in
the
tom
a
lucky
fellow
said
the
cousin
i
wish
you
had
insisted
on
my
taking
some
of
that
stock
of
his
when
you
bought
yes
you
made
a
great
mistake
said
the
other
with
whimsical
superiority
you
should
have
taken
my
advice
you
would
now
be
rolling
in
riches
as
i
am
with
a
much
better
figure
for
the
cousin
smoked
a
while
do
you
know
i
think
tom
about
the
best
fellow
i
ever
he
a
good
boy
said
the
other
with
the
accent
of
a
father
pride
and
tenderness
going
to
bring
his
pretty
chickens
and
their
dam
asked
the
cousin
parting
his
to
the
genial
influence
of
the
fire
no
it
a
short
visit
they
going
into
the
virginia
mountains
for
the
a
manservant
came
in
and
said
something
in
a
low
voice
heigh
what
why
of
course
certainly
by
all
means
show
him
in
come
in
parson
come
in
called
the
host
to
his
yet
unseen
visitor
and
he
held
out
his
hand
for
sewell
to
take
when
he
appeared
at
the
door
glad
to
see
you
i
ca
get
up
a
little
gouty
but
bellingham
on
foot
difficulty
is
sitting
bellingham
gave
the
minister
a
man
glare
through
his
glasses
and
then
came
eagerly
forward
and
shook
hands
oh
sewell
i
hope
you
come
to
put
up
some
job
on
corey
do
spare
him
with
kanawha
paint
at
the
present
figures
he
merits
any
demand
that
christian
charity
can
make
upon
him
the
man
prosperity
is
i
glad
to
find
you
here
bellingham
said
sewell
sitting
down
oh
is
it
pleaded
bellingham
i
do
know
that
it
a
deadly
weapon
of
any
kind
returned
the
minister
but
if
one
of
you
ca
help
me
perhaps
the
other
well
let
us
know
what
the
job
is
said
corey
we
refuse
to
commit
ourselves
i
shall
have
to
begin
at
the
beginning
said
sewell
warningly
and
the
beginning
is
a
long
way
no
matter
said
bellingham
adventurously
the
further
off
the
better
i
been
dining
with
corey
he
gives
you
a
very
good
dinner
now
corey
does
and
i
just
in
the
mood
for
a
deserving
the
trouble
with
sewell
is
said
corey
that
he
does
always
take
the
trouble
to
have
them
deserving
i
hope
this
is
interesting
at
i
suspect
you
find
it
more
interesting
than
i
shall
said
the
minister
inwardly
preparing
himself
for
the
amusement
which
history
always
created
in
his
hearers
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
began
that
he
was
always
telling
this
story
and
that
his
part
in
the
affair
was
always
becoming
less
and
less
respectable
no
point
was
lost
upon
his
hearers
they
laughed
till
the
ladies
in
the
above
wondered
what
the
joke
could
be
at
any
rate
said
bellingham
the
fellow
behaved
magnificently
at
the
fire
i
read
the
accounts
of
i
think
his
exploits
owe
something
to
the
imagination
of
the
reporters
said
sewell
he
tells
a
different
story
oh
of
course
said
bellingham
well
and
what
else
asked
corey
there
is
any
more
simply
he
out
of
work
and
wants
something
to
do
anything
to
do
anything
that
is
ah
that
a
queer
start
of
his
said
bellingham
thoughtfully
i
do
know
but
i
like
and
do
you
come
to
such
effete
posterity
as
we
are
for
help
in
a
case
like
that
demanded
corey
why
the
boy
an
ancestor
so
he
is
why
so
he
is
so
he
is
said
bellingham
with
delight
in
the
discovery
of
course
he
is
all
you
have
to
do
pursued
corey
is
to
give
him
time
and
found
a
fortune
and
a
family
and
his
children
children
will
be
cutting
ours
in
society
half
of
our
great
people
have
come
up
in
that
way
look
at
the
where
our
nobility
is
enrolled
it
the
apotheosis
of
mechanics
insidemen
and
i
do
know
what
but
in
the
meantime
this
ancestor
is
now
so
remote
that
he
has
nothing
to
do
suggested
sewell
if
you
give
him
time
you
kill
well
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
corey
is
thinking
of
setting
up
a
buttons
but
you
say
this
boy
has
a
soul
above
buttons
and
besides
he
too
look
here
bromfield
said
bellingham
why
do
you
get
to
read
to
you
corey
glanced
from
his
cousin
to
the
minister
whose
face
betrayed
that
this
was
precisely
what
he
had
had
in
his
own
mind
is
that
the
job
asked
corey
sewell
nodded
boldly
he
would
read
through
his
nose
would
he
i
could
stand
that
i
stopped
talking
through
mine
you
why
look
here
bromfield
said
bellingham
for
the
second
time
why
do
you
let
me
manage
this
affair
for
you
i
not
of
much
use
in
the
world
but
from
time
to
time
i
like
to
do
my
poor
best
and
this
is
just
one
of
the
kind
of
things
i
think
i
fitted
for
i
should
like
to
see
this
young
man
when
i
read
in
the
newspapers
of
some
fellow
who
has
done
a
fine
thing
i
always
want
to
see
what
manner
of
man
he
is
and
i
glad
of
any
chance
that
throws
him
in
my
your
foible
notorious
charles
but
i
do
see
why
you
keep
my
cigars
all
to
yourself
said
corey
my
dear
fellow
said
bellingham
making
a
hospitable
offer
of
the
from
the
mantel
you
said
they
cut
you
ah
so
they
have
i
forgot
well
what
your
plan
my
plan
said
bellingham
is
to
have
him
to
breakfast
with
me
and
interview
him
generally
and
get
him
to
read
me
a
few
passages
without
rousing
his
suspicions
heigh
i
do
know
that
i
believe
much
in
your
plan
said
corey
i
should
like
to
hear
what
my
spiritual
adviser
has
to
i
should
know
what
to
advise
exactly
said
sewell
but
i
reject
any
plan
that
gives
my
client
a
is
client
rather
euphuistic
asked
corey
it
is
rather
but
i
got
into
the
habit
of
handling
barker
very
delicately
even
in
thought
i
not
sure
he
come
added
sewell
turning
to
bellingham
oh
yes
he
will
said
bellingham
tell
him
it
business
there
be
anybody
there
will
nine
be
too
late
for
him
i
imagine
he
more
accustomed
to
five
at
home
and
seven
well
we
say
nine
anyway
i
ca
imagine
the
cause
that
would
get
me
up
earlier
here
he
turned
to
the
mantel
and
wrote
an
invitation
upon
his
card
and
handed
it
to
sewell
please
give
him
that
from
me
and
beg
him
to
come
i
really
want
to
see
him
and
if
he
ca
read
well
enough
for
this
fastidious
old
gentleman
we
see
what
else
he
can
do
corey
tells
me
he
expects
tom
on
this
summer
he
concluded
in
dismissal
of
lemuel
as
a
topic
ah
said
sewell
putting
the
card
in
his
pocket
i
very
glad
to
hear
he
had
something
but
not
so
much
of
the
difficulty
in
overcoming
lemuel
reluctance
that
he
had
feared
and
on
the
morning
named
lemuel
presented
himself
at
the
address
on
bellingham
card
exactly
at
nine
he
had
the
card
in
his
hand
and
he
gave
it
to
the
man
who
opened
the
street
door
of
the
bachelors
apartment
house
where
bellingham
lived
the
man
read
it
carefully
over
and
then
said
oh
yes
second
floor
and
handing
it
back
left
lemuel
to
wander
upstairs
alone
he
was
going
to
offer
the
card
again
at
bellingham
door
but
he
had
a
dawning
misgiving
bellingham
had
opened
the
door
himself
and
feigning
to
regard
the
card
as
offered
by
way
of
introduction
he
gave
his
hand
cordially
and
led
him
into
the
cozy
room
where
the
table
was
already
laid
for
breakfast
glad
to
see
you
glad
to
see
you
barker
give
me
your
coat
ah
i
see
you
scorn
the
effeminacy
of
things
put
your
hat
anywhere
the
advantage
of
bachelors
quarters
is
that
you
put
anything
anywhere
we
have
a
woman
on
the
premises
and
you
can
fancy
how
unmolested
we
lemuel
had
caught
sight
of
one
over
the
mantel
who
had
nothing
but
her
on
and
was
called
an
etude
but
he
no
longer
trembled
for
evil
or
for
good
in
such
presences
that
one
of
those
things
said
bellingham
catching
the
direction
of
his
eye
i
forget
the
fellow
name
but
it
is
bad
we
pretty
snug
here
he
added
throwing
open
two
doors
in
succession
to
show
the
extent
of
his
apartment
here
you
have
the
and
and
library
in
one
and
here
my
bedroom
and
here
my
he
pulled
an
up
toward
the
low
fire
for
lemuel
but
perhaps
you
hot
from
walking
sit
wherever
you
lemuel
chose
to
sit
by
the
window
it
very
mild
out
he
said
and
bellingham
did
not
exact
anything
more
of
him
he
talked
at
him
and
left
lemuel
to
make
his
mental
inventory
of
the
dense
turkey
rugs
on
the
slippery
hardwood
floor
the
pictures
on
the
avails
the
deep
seats
the
on
the
mantel
the
tall
coloured
chests
of
drawers
in
two
corners
the
delicate
china
and
quaint
silver
on
the
table
presently
steps
were
heard
outside
and
bellingham
threw
open
the
door
as
he
had
to
lemuel
and
gave
a
hand
to
each
of
the
two
guests
whom
he
met
on
his
threshold
ah
meredith
good
morning
venerable
father
he
drew
them
in
let
me
introduce
you
to
barker
meredith
barker
the
rev
seyton
you
fellows
are
pretty
we
pretty
hungry
said
meredith
i
do
know
that
we
should
have
got
here
if
we
had
leaned
up
against
each
other
as
we
came
along
several
policemen
regarded
us
suspiciously
but
seyton
cloth
protected
it
was
terrible
coming
up
beacon
street
with
an
old
offender
like
meredith
at
what
he
considered
the
dead
hour
of
the
night
said
seyton
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
if
any
one
had
been
awake
to
see
you
shall
have
breakfast
instantly
said
bellingham
touching
an
annunciator
and
awakening
a
distant
electric
titter
somewhere
seyton
came
toward
lemuel
who
took
the
young
ritualist
for
a
catholic
priest
but
was
not
proof
against
the
sweet
friendliness
which
charmed
every
one
with
him
and
was
soon
talking
at
more
ease
than
he
had
felt
from
all
bellingham
cordial
intention
he
was
put
at
his
host
right
hand
when
they
sat
down
and
seyton
was
given
the
foot
so
that
they
continued
their
talk
mr
bellingham
tells
me
you
know
my
friend
sewell
said
the
clergyman
lemuel
face
kindled
oh
yes
do
you
know
him
too
yes
i
known
him
a
long
time
he
a
capital
fellow
sewell
i
think
he
a
great
preacher
ventured
lemuel
ah
well
yes
is
he
i
never
heard
him
lecture
said
seyton
looking
down
at
his
bread
i
swear
seyton
said
meredith
across
the
table
when
you
put
on
that
ecclesiastical
superciliousness
of
yours
i
want
to
cuff
i
no
doubt
he
receive
it
in
a
proper
spirit
said
bellingham
who
was
eating
himself
hot
and
red
from
the
planked
shad
before
him
but
you
must
do
it
of
course
said
seyton
sewell
is
a
very
able
man
and
no
end
of
a
good
fellow
but
you
ca
expect
me
to
admit
he
a
he
smiled
in
sweet
enjoyment
of
his
friend
wrath
lemuel
observed
that
he
spoke
with
an
accent
different
from
the
others
which
he
thought
very
pleasant
but
he
did
not
know
it
for
that
neat
utterance
which
the
anglican
church
bestows
upon
its
servants
he
no
jesuit
growled
meredith
i
bound
to
say
he
not
a
pagan
either
laughed
the
clergyman
these
gentlemen
exchange
these
little
knocks
bellingham
explained
to
lemuel
somewhat
puzzled
look
because
they
were
boys
together
at
school
and
college
and
ca
realise
that
they
grown
up
to
be
lights
of
the
bar
and
the
he
looked
round
at
the
different
plates
have
some
more
shad
no
one
wanted
more
it
seemed
and
bellingham
sent
it
away
by
the
man
who
replaced
it
with
broiled
chicken
before
bellingham
and
lamb
chops
in
front
of
seyton
this
is
all
there
is
the
host
said
it
enough
for
me
said
meredith
if
no
one
else
takes
but
in
fact
there
was
also
an
omelet
and
bread
and
butter
delicious
beyond
anything
that
lemuel
had
tasted
and
there
was
a
bouquet
of
pink
radishes
with
fragments
of
ice
dropped
among
olives
and
other
facts
of
a
polite
breakfast
at
the
close
came
a
dish
of
what
bellingham
called
premature
strawberries
why
they
actually
said
meredith
and
they
as
natural
as
yes
they
all
you
say
said
bellingham
you
can
have
strawberries
any
time
nowadays
after
new
year
if
you
send
far
enough
for
them
but
to
get
them
ripe
and
sound
or
distinguishable
from
small
turnips
in
taste
is
another
lemuel
had
never
imagined
a
breakfast
like
that
he
wondered
at
himself
for
having
respected
the
cuisine
of
the
albans
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
and
the
person
he
had
been
the
the
captive
of
the
police
the
guest
of
the
wayfarer
lodge
the
servant
of
miss
vane
and
the
at
the
hotel
could
not
be
the
same
person
he
fell
into
a
strange
reverie
while
the
talk
in
which
he
had
shared
so
little
took
a
range
far
beyond
him
then
he
looked
up
and
found
all
the
eyes
upon
him
and
heard
bellingham
saying
i
fancy
barker
can
tell
us
something
about
that
and
at
lemuel
mystified
stare
he
added
about
the
amount
of
smoke
at
a
fire
that
a
man
could
fight
through
seyton
was
speaking
of
the
train
that
was
caught
in
the
forest
fires
down
in
maine
the
other
day
how
was
it
with
you
at
the
albans
lemuel
blushed
it
was
clear
that
bellingham
had
been
reading
that
ridiculous
newspaper
version
of
his
exploit
there
was
hardly
any
smoke
at
all
where
i
was
it
did
seem
to
have
got
into
the
upper
entries
that
just
what
i
was
saying
triumphed
bellingham
if
a
man
has
anything
to
do
he
can
get
on
that
the
way
with
the
firemen
it
the
that
paralyses
do
you
remember
your
sensations
at
all
when
you
were
coming
through
the
fire
those
things
are
very
curious
sometimes
bellingham
suggested
there
was
no
fire
where
i
was
said
lemuel
stoutly
but
helpless
to
make
a
more
comprehensive
disclaimer
i
imagine
you
would
notice
that
any
more
than
the
smoke
said
bellingham
with
a
look
of
satisfaction
in
his
hero
for
his
other
guests
it
a
sort
of
ecstasy
do
you
remember
that
fellow
of
bret
harte
in
christmas
came
to
simpson
who
gets
a
shot
in
his
leg
or
something
when
he
riding
to
get
the
sick
boy
a
christmas
present
and
does
know
it
till
he
drops
off
his
horse
in
a
faint
when
he
gets
back
he
jumped
actively
up
from
the
table
and
found
the
book
on
his
shelf
there
he
fumbled
for
his
glasses
without
finding
them
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
read
the
passage
barker
i
think
found
the
page
it
he
sat
down
again
and
the
others
waited
lemuel
read
as
he
needs
must
and
he
did
his
best
ah
that
very
nice
glad
you
did
dramatise
it
the
drama
ought
to
be
in
the
words
not
the
reader
i
like
your
quiet
harte
seems
to
have
been
about
the
last
of
the
to
give
us
the
great
simple
heroes
said
seyton
when
the
others
were
gone
and
lemuel
who
had
been
afraid
to
go
first
rose
to
take
himself
away
bellingham
shook
his
hand
cordially
and
said
i
hope
you
were
bored
the
fact
is
i
rather
promised
myself
a
with
you
and
i
told
sewell
so
but
i
fell
in
with
seyton
and
meredith
yesterday
you
ca
help
falling
in
with
one
when
you
fall
in
with
the
other
they
inseparable
when
seyton
in
town
and
i
could
resist
the
temptation
to
ask
oh
no
i
was
bored
at
all
said
lemuel
i
very
glad
but
sit
down
a
moment
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
a
little
matter
of
business
sewell
was
telling
us
something
of
you
the
other
night
at
my
cousin
bromfield
corey
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
be
willing
to
come
and
read
to
him
his
eyes
seem
to
be
on
the
wane
some
way
and
he
rather
sleepless
he
give
you
a
bed
and
sometimes
you
have
to
read
to
him
in
the
night
you
take
your
meals
where
you
like
how
does
it
strike
you
supposing
the
pittance
can
be
arranged
why
if
you
think
i
can
do
it
began
lemuel
of
course
i
do
you
do
happen
to
read
french
lemuel
shook
his
head
hopelessly
i
studied
latin
some
at
school
ah
well
i
do
think
he
care
for
latin
i
think
we
better
stick
to
english
for
the
bellingham
arranged
for
lemuel
to
go
with
him
that
afternoon
to
his
cousin
and
make
as
he
phrased
it
a
stagger
at
the
job
xxvi
the
stagger
seemed
to
be
sufficiently
satisfactory
corey
could
not
repress
some
twinges
at
certain
characteristics
of
lemuel
accent
but
he
seemed
in
a
critical
way
to
take
a
fancy
to
him
and
he
was
conditionally
installed
for
a
week
corey
was
pleased
from
the
beginning
with
lemuel
good
looks
and
justified
himself
to
his
wife
with
an
italian
proverb
su
cento
chi
è
bello
difuori
ê
buono
di
she
had
heard
that
proverb
before
and
she
had
always
considered
it
shocking
but
he
insisted
that
most
people
married
upon
no
better
grounds
and
that
what
sufficed
in
the
choice
of
a
husband
or
wife
was
enough
for
the
choice
of
an
intellectual
nurse
he
corrected
lemuel
pronunciation
where
he
found
it
faulty
and
amused
himself
with
lemuel
struggles
to
conceal
his
hurt
vanity
and
his
final
good
sense
in
profiting
by
the
correction
but
lemuel
reading
was
really
very
good
it
was
what
even
more
than
his
writing
had
given
him
a
literary
reputation
in
willoughby
pastures
and
the
old
man
made
him
exercise
it
in
widely
different
directions
chiefly
however
it
was
novels
that
he
read
which
indeed
are
the
chief
reading
of
most
people
in
our
time
and
as
they
were
necessarily
the
novels
of
our
language
his
elder
was
not
obliged
to
use
that
care
in
choosing
them
which
he
must
have
exacted
of
himself
in
the
fiction
of
other
tongues
he
liked
to
hear
lemuel
talk
and
he
used
the
art
of
getting
at
the
boy
life
by
being
frank
with
his
own
experience
but
this
was
not
always
successful
and
he
was
interested
to
find
lemuel
keeping
doors
that
sewell
narrative
had
opened
carefully
closed
against
him
he
betrayed
no
consciousness
that
they
existed
and
lemuel
maintained
intact
the
dignity
and
pride
which
come
from
the
sense
of
ignominy
well
hidden
the
week
of
probation
had
passed
without
interrupting
their
relation
and
lemuel
was
regularly
installed
and
began
to
lead
a
life
which
was
so
cut
off
from
his
past
in
most
things
that
it
seemed
to
belie
it
he
found
himself
dropped
in
the
midst
of
luxury
stranger
to
him
than
the
things
they
read
of
in
those
innumerable
novels
the
dull
rich
colours
in
the
walls
and
the
heavily
rugged
floors
and
leathern
seats
of
the
library
where
he
read
to
the
old
man
the
beautiful
forms
of
the
famous
bronzes
and
the
italian
saints
and
martyrs
in
their
baroque
or
gothic
frames
of
dim
gold
the
low
shelves
with
their
ranks
of
luxurious
bindings
and
all
the
seriously
elegant
keeping
of
the
place
flattered
him
out
of
his
strangeness
and
the
footing
on
which
he
was
received
in
this
house
the
respect
with
which
the
treated
him
the
master
light
cordial
frankness
the
distant
graciousness
of
the
mistress
and
the
unembarrassed
unembarrassing
kindliness
of
the
young
ladies
both
so
much
older
than
himself
contributed
to
an
effect
that
afterwards
deepened
more
and
more
and
became
a
vital
part
of
the
struggle
which
he
was
finally
to
hold
with
himself
the
first
two
or
three
days
he
saw
no
one
but
corey
and
but
for
the
women
voices
in
the
other
parts
of
the
house
he
might
have
supposed
himself
in
another
bachelor
apartments
finer
and
grander
than
bellingham
he
was
presented
to
corey
when
she
came
into
the
library
but
he
did
not
see
the
daughters
of
the
house
till
he
was
installed
in
it
after
that
his
acquaintance
with
them
seemed
to
go
no
further
they
were
all
polite
and
kind
when
they
met
him
in
the
library
or
on
the
stairs
but
they
showed
no
curiosity
about
him
and
his
never
meeting
them
at
table
helped
to
keep
him
a
stranger
to
them
under
the
same
roof
he
ate
at
a
in
a
neighbouring
street
but
he
slept
at
the
coreys
after
he
had
read
their
father
asleep
and
then
going
out
to
his
late
breakfast
he
did
not
return
till
corey
had
eaten
his
own
much
later
he
wondered
at
first
that
neither
of
those
young
ladies
read
to
their
father
not
knowing
the
disability
for
mutual
help
that
riches
bring
later
he
saw
how
much
miss
lily
corey
was
engrossed
with
charity
and
art
and
how
constantly
miss
nannie
corey
was
occupied
with
social
cares
and
was
perpetually
going
and
coming
in
their
performance
then
he
saw
that
they
could
not
have
rendered
nor
their
father
have
received
from
his
family
the
duty
which
he
was
paid
to
do
as
they
must
have
done
if
they
had
been
poorer
but
they
were
all
fond
of
one
another
and
the
father
had
a
way
of
joking
with
his
daughters
especially
the
youngest
and
they
talked
with
a
freedom
of
themselves
which
puzzled
lemuel
it
appeared
from
what
they
said
at
different
times
that
they
had
not
always
been
so
rich
or
that
they
had
once
had
money
and
then
less
and
now
much
more
it
appeared
also
that
their
prosperity
was
due
to
a
piece
of
luck
and
that
the
young
corey
whom
they
expected
in
the
summer
had
brought
it
about
his
father
was
very
proud
of
him
and
getting
more
and
more
used
to
lemuel
companionship
he
talked
a
great
deal
about
his
tom
as
he
called
him
and
about
tom
wife
and
his
family
who
were
somehow
lemuel
inferred
not
all
that
his
own
family
could
wish
them
but
very
good
people
once
when
corey
was
talking
of
them
corey
came
in
upon
them
and
seemed
to
be
uneasy
as
if
she
thought
he
was
saying
too
much
but
the
daughters
did
not
seem
to
care
especially
the
youngest
he
found
out
that
corey
used
to
be
a
painter
and
had
lived
a
long
time
in
italy
when
he
was
young
and
he
recalled
with
a
voluptuous
thrill
of
secrecy
that
williams
had
once
been
in
italy
corey
seemed
to
think
better
of
it
than
williams
he
liked
to
talk
of
rome
and
florence
and
of
venice
which
williams
had
said
was
a
kind
of
hole
the
old
man
said
this
or
that
picture
was
of
this
or
that
school
and
vague
lights
of
knowledge
and
senses
of
difference
that
flattered
intellectual
vanity
stole
in
upon
him
he
began
to
feel
that
the
things
corey
had
lived
for
were
the
great
and
high
objects
of
life
he
now
perceived
how
far
from
really
fine
or
fashionable
anything
at
the
albans
had
been
and
that
the
simplicity
of
miss
vane
little
house
which
the
splendour
of
the
hotel
had
eclipsed
in
his
crude
fancy
was
much
more
in
harmony
with
the
richness
of
corey
he
oriented
himself
anew
and
got
another
view
of
the
world
which
he
had
dropped
into
occasionally
he
had
glimpses
of
people
who
came
to
see
the
coreys
and
it
puzzled
him
that
this
family
which
he
knew
so
kind
and
good
took
with
others
the
tone
hard
and
even
cynical
which
seemed
the
prevailing
tone
of
society
when
their
acquaintances
went
away
they
dropped
back
as
if
with
relief
into
their
sincere
and
amiable
fashions
of
speech
lemuel
asked
himself
if
every
one
in
the
world
was
playing
a
part
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
miss
carver
had
been
she
was
always
the
same
and
always
herself
to
be
appeared
to
him
the
best
thing
in
the
world
and
he
longed
for
it
the
more
as
he
felt
that
he
too
was
insensibly
beginning
to
play
a
part
being
so
much
in
this
beautiful
and
luxurious
house
where
every
one
was
so
well
dressed
and
well
mannered
and
well
kept
in
body
and
mind
and
passing
from
his
amazement
at
all
its
appointments
into
the
habit
of
its
comfortable
beauty
he
forgot
more
and
more
the
humility
and
the
humiliations
of
his
past
he
did
not
forget
its
claims
upon
him
he
sent
home
every
week
the
greater
part
of
his
earnings
and
he
wrote
often
to
his
mother
but
now
when
he
could
have
got
the
time
to
go
home
and
see
her
he
did
not
go
in
the
exquisite
taste
of
his
present
environment
he
could
scarcely
believe
in
that
figure
grizzled
leathern
and
gaunt
and
costumed
in
a
grotesque
unlikeness
to
either
sex
sometimes
he
played
with
the
fantastic
supposition
of
some
other
origin
for
himself
romantic
and
involved
like
that
of
some
of
the
heroes
he
was
always
reading
of
which
excluded
her
another
effect
of
this
multifarious
literature
through
which
his
duties
led
him
was
the
awakening
of
the
ambition
to
write
stunned
by
his
first
disastrous
adventures
in
boston
and
dormant
almost
ever
since
except
as
it
had
stirred
under
the
promptings
of
evans
kindly
interest
but
now
it
did
not
take
the
form
of
verse
he
began
to
write
moralistic
essays
never
finished
but
full
of
severe
comment
on
the
folly
of
the
world
as
he
saw
it
sometimes
they
were
examinations
of
himself
and
his
ideas
and
principles
his
doctrines
and
practice
penetrating
quests
such
as
the
theologians
of
an
earlier
day
used
to
address
to
their
consciences
meantime
the
deeply
underlying
mass
of
his
rustic
crudity
and
raw
youth
took
on
a
far
higher
polish
than
it
had
yet
worn
words
dropped
at
random
in
the
talk
he
now
heard
supplied
him
with
motives
and
shaped
his
actions
once
bellingham
came
in
laughing
about
a
sign
which
he
saw
in
a
back
street
of
misfit
parlours
and
lemuel
spent
the
next
salary
for
a
suit
at
a
large
clothing
store
to
replace
the
dress
sewell
had
thought
him
so
well
in
he
began
insensibly
to
ape
the
manners
of
those
about
him
it
drew
near
the
time
when
the
ladies
of
the
corey
family
were
to
leave
town
where
they
had
lingered
much
longer
than
they
meant
in
the
hope
that
corey
might
be
so
much
better
or
so
much
worse
that
he
would
consent
to
go
to
the
shore
with
them
but
his
disabilities
remained
much
the
same
and
his
inveterate
habits
indomitable
by
this
time
that
trust
in
lemuel
which
never
failed
to
grow
up
in
those
near
him
reconciled
the
ladies
to
the
obstinate
resolution
of
the
master
of
the
house
to
stay
in
it
as
usual
they
gave
up
the
notion
of
a
cottage
and
they
were
not
going
far
away
nor
for
long
at
any
one
time
in
fact
one
or
other
of
them
was
always
in
the
house
corey
had
grown
into
the
habit
of
confidence
with
lemuel
concerning
her
husband
whims
and
foibles
and
this
motherly
frankness
from
a
lady
so
stately
and
distant
at
first
was
a
flattery
more
poisonous
to
his
soul
than
any
other
circumstance
of
his
changed
life
it
came
july
and
even
sewell
went
away
then
he
went
with
a
mind
at
rest
concerning
lemuel
material
prospects
and
his
unquestionable
usefulness
and
acceptability
but
something
at
the
bottom
of
his
satisfaction
teased
him
still
a
dumb
fear
that
the
boy
was
extravagant
a
sense
that
he
was
somehow
different
and
not
wholly
for
the
better
from
what
he
had
been
he
had
seen
perhaps
nothing
worse
in
him
than
that
growth
of
manner
which
amused
corey
he
is
putting
us
on
he
said
to
bellingham
one
day
and
making
us
fit
as
well
as
he
can
i
do
think
we
altogether
becoming
but
our
fault
probably
i
ca
help
thinking
that
if
we
were
of
better
cut
and
material
we
should
show
to
better
effect
upon
that
granite
soul
i
wish
tom
were
here
i
an
idea
that
tom
would
fit
him
like
a
glove
charles
why
do
pose
as
a
model
for
barker
i
do
see
why
i
not
a
very
good
model
without
posing
said
bellingham
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
for
him
take
him
to
the
club
barker
very
you
do
take
him
on
the
right
topics
said
corey
not
minding
that
he
had
left
the
point
i
assure
you
that
barker
on
any
serious
question
that
comes
up
in
our
reading
has
a
clear
head
and
an
apt
tongue
of
his
own
it
is
our
manners
alone
that
he
emulates
i
find
that
any
of
us
ever
dropped
an
idea
or
suggestion
of
value
that
barker
did
pick
it
up
and
turn
it
to
much
more
account
than
the
owner
he
as
true
as
a
tuscan
peasant
as
proud
as
an
indian
and
as
quick
as
a
ah
i
you
would
go
abroad
for
that
last
said
bellingham
no
and
it
delightful
seeing
the
great
variety
of
human
nature
there
is
in
every
human
being
here
our
life
is
stratified
perhaps
it
never
will
be
at
any
rate
for
the
present
we
all
in
vertical
sections
but
i
always
go
back
to
my
first
notion
of
barker
ancestral
and
he
makes
me
feel
like
degenerate
posterity
i
had
the
same
sensation
with
tom
but
barker
seems
to
go
a
little
further
back
i
suppose
there
such
a
thing
as
getting
too
far
back
in
these
origin
of
species
days
but
he
is
excessive
in
that
or
in
anything
confoundedly
temperate
in
fact
and
he
reticent
he
does
allow
any
unseemly
intimacy
he
always
turning
me
of
course
but
what
can
we
old
fellows
hope
to
know
of
what
going
on
in
any
young
one
talk
of
strangeness
i
undertake
to
find
more
in
common
with
a
florid
old
fellow
of
fifty
from
the
red
planet
mars
than
with
any
young
bostonian
of
yes
but
it
the
youth
of
my
sires
that
i
find
so
strange
in
barker
only
theoretically
there
no
puritanism
he
a
thorough
believer
in
sewell
i
suspect
he
could
formulate
sewell
theology
a
great
deal
better
than
sewell
xxvii
statira
and
grier
had
given
up
their
plan
of
getting
places
in
a
summer
hotel
when
lemuel
absolutely
refused
to
take
part
in
it
and
were
working
through
the
summer
in
the
lemuel
came
less
regularly
to
see
them
now
for
his
sunday
nights
had
to
be
at
corey
disposition
but
statira
was
always
happy
in
his
coming
and
made
him
more
excuses
than
he
had
thought
of
if
he
had
let
a
longer
interval
than
usual
pass
he
could
not
help
feeling
the
loveliness
of
her
patience
the
sweetness
of
her
constancy
but
he
disliked
grier
more
and
more
and
she
grew
stiffer
and
sharper
with
him
sometimes
the
aimlessness
of
his
relation
to
statira
hung
round
him
like
a
cloud
which
he
could
not
see
beyond
when
he
was
with
her
he
contented
himself
with
the
pleasure
he
felt
in
her
devotion
and
the
tenderness
this
awakened
in
his
own
heart
but
when
he
was
away
from
her
there
was
a
strange
disgust
and
bitterness
in
these
sometimes
when
statira
and
grier
took
a
saturday
afternoon
off
he
went
with
them
into
the
country
on
one
of
the
lines
or
else
to
some
matinee
at
a
in
the
suburbs
statira
liked
the
theatre
better
than
anything
else
and
she
used
to
meet
other
girls
whom
she
knew
there
and
had
a
gay
time
she
introduced
lemuel
to
them
and
after
a
few
moments
of
high
civility
and
distance
they
treated
him
familiarly
as
statira
beau
their
talk
after
that
he
was
now
used
to
was
flat
and
foolish
and
their
pert
ease
incensed
him
he
came
away
bruised
and
burning
and
feeling
himself
unfit
to
breathe
the
refined
and
gentle
air
to
which
he
returned
in
corey
presence
then
he
would
vow
in
his
heart
never
to
expose
himself
to
such
things
again
but
he
could
not
tell
statira
that
he
despised
the
friends
she
was
happy
with
he
could
only
go
with
a
reluctance
it
was
not
easy
to
hide
and
atone
by
greater
tenderness
for
a
manner
that
wounded
her
one
day
toward
the
end
of
august
when
they
were
together
at
a
suburban
theatre
statira
wandered
off
to
a
pond
there
was
in
the
grounds
with
some
other
girls
who
had
asked
him
to
go
and
row
them
and
had
called
him
a
bear
for
refusing
and
told
him
to
look
out
for
barnum
they
left
him
sitting
alone
with
grier
at
a
table
where
they
had
all
been
having
at
his
expense
and
though
it
was
no
longer
any
pleasure
to
be
with
her
it
was
better
than
to
be
with
them
for
she
was
not
a
fool
at
any
rate
statira
turned
round
at
a
little
distance
to
mock
them
with
a
gesture
and
a
laugh
and
the
laugh
ended
in
a
cough
long
and
shattering
so
that
one
of
her
companions
had
to
stop
with
her
and
put
her
arm
round
her
till
she
could
recover
herself
and
go
on
it
sent
a
cold
thrill
through
lemuel
and
then
he
turned
angry
what
is
it
statira
does
to
keep
taking
more
cold
oh
i
guess
cold
said
grier
what
do
you
mean
i
guess
you
cared
a
great
deal
you
noticed
that
cough
hers
before
now
done
it
any
too
much
good
workin
in
that
arsenic
paper
all
summer
grier
talked
with
her
face
turned
away
from
him
it
provoked
him
more
and
more
i
care
he
retorted
eager
to
quarrel
and
you
know
it
who
got
her
into
the
i
should
like
to
know
did
said
grier
turning
sharply
on
him
and
you
her
there
and
between
us
we
killed
how
have
i
kept
her
there
i
should
like
to
know
you
done
she
wanted
you
should
she
might
been
at
some
pleasant
place
in
the
country
the
or
somewhere
she
been
her
cough
by
this
time
but
no
you
was
too
nasty
proud
for
that
lemuel
barker
a
heavy
load
of
guilt
dropped
upon
lemuel
heart
but
he
flung
it
off
and
he
retorted
furiously
you
ought
to
have
been
ashamed
of
yourself
to
ever
want
her
to
take
a
servant
oh
a
servant
place
if
she
been
ashamed
of
a
servant
when
you
came
meechin
round
her
where
you
been
i
sh
like
to
know
and
now
i
wish
she
had
if
she
such
a
little
fool
all
wrapped
in
you
the
way
she
is
i
could
wish
she
never
set
eyes
on
you
again
servant
or
no
servant
but
i
presume
it
too
late
now
and
i
presume
she
got
to
go
on
for
you
and
wonderin
what
done
to
offend
you
when
you
do
come
and
what
she
done
when
you
do
with
your
masterful
airs
and
your
ways
but
do
you
try
to
pretend
to
me
lemuel
barker
you
care
the
least
mite
for
her
any
more
you
ever
did
because
it
wo
go
down
if
such
a
perfect
little
blind
fool
she
could
see
you
did
care
for
her
any
more
than
the
ground
you
walk
on
you
be
glad
enough
if
she
was
under
it
if
you
could
be
rid
of
her
any
other
way
grier
pulled
her
handkerchief
out
and
began
to
cry
into
it
lemuel
was
powerfully
shaken
by
this
attack
he
did
feel
responsible
for
statira
staying
in
town
all
summer
but
the
spectacle
of
grier
publicly
crying
at
his
side
in
a
place
like
that
helped
to
counteract
the
effect
of
her
words
do
cry
he
began
looking
fearfully
round
him
everybody
see
you
i
do
care
let
them
sobbed
the
girl
if
they
knowed
what
i
know
and
could
see
you
cryin
i
guess
they
think
you
looked
worse
than
i
do
you
do
understand
i
can
explain
no
you
ca
explain
barker
said
grier
whipping
down
her
handkerchief
and
fiercely
confronting
him
across
the
table
you
ca
explain
anything
so
to
blind
me
any
longer
i
was
a
big
fool
to
ever
suppose
you
had
any
heart
in
you
but
when
you
came
round
at
first
and
was
so
meek
you
could
say
your
soul
was
your
own
and
was
so
glad
if
spoke
to
you
or
looked
at
you
that
you
was
ready
to
go
crazy
i
suppose
there
was
some
something
to
you
and
yes
i
helped
you
on
all
i
could
and
helped
you
to
fool
that
poor
thing
that
you
ai
worthy
to
kiss
the
ground
she
walks
on
lord
forgive
me
it
but
it
all
changed
now
you
seem
to
think
it
the
greatest
favour
if
you
come
round
once
a
fortnight
and
set
and
let
her
talk
to
you
and
show
you
how
she
dotes
upon
you
the
poor
little
silly
coot
and
if
you
ever
speak
a
word
it
like
the
lord
unto
moses
it
so
grand
but
i
understand
you
got
other
friends
now
after
that
oh
you
can
blush
and
try
to
turn
it
off
i
seen
you
blush
before
and
i
know
you
and
i
know
you
in
love
with
that
girl
and
you
just
waitin
to
break
off
with
but
you
hai
got
the
spirit
to
up
and
do
it
like
a
man
you
want
to
let
it
lag
along
and
along
and
see
something
wo
happen
to
get
you
out
of
it
waitin
for
her
to
well
you
wo
have
to
wait
long
but
if
i
was
a
man
i
spoil
your
beauty
for
you
the
torrent
of
her
words
rolled
him
on
bruising
and
tearing
his
soul
which
their
truth
pierced
like
jagged
points
from
time
to
time
he
opened
his
lips
to
protest
or
deny
but
no
words
came
and
in
his
silence
a
fury
of
scorn
for
the
poor
faithful
scolding
thing
so
just
so
wildly
unjust
gathered
head
in
him
be
still
he
ground
between
his
teeth
be
still
you
he
stopped
for
the
word
and
that
saved
him
from
the
outrage
he
had
meant
to
pay
her
back
with
he
rose
from
the
table
you
can
tell
statira
what
said
to
me
i
going
he
rushed
away
the
anger
was
like
strong
drink
in
his
brain
he
was
like
one
drunk
all
the
way
back
to
the
city
in
the
car
he
could
not
go
to
corey
at
once
he
felt
as
if
physically
besmeared
with
shame
he
could
not
go
to
his
it
would
have
been
as
if
he
had
shown
himself
there
in
a
coat
of
tar
and
feathers
those
insolent
true
degrading
words
hissed
in
his
ears
and
stung
him
incessantly
they
accused
they
condemned
with
pitiless
iteration
and
yet
there
were
instants
when
he
knew
himself
guiltless
of
all
the
wrong
of
which
in
another
sense
he
knew
himself
guilty
in
his
room
he
renewed
the
battle
within
himself
that
he
had
fought
so
long
in
his
wanderings
up
and
down
the
street
and
he
conquered
himself
at
last
into
the
theory
that
statira
had
authorised
or
permitted
grier
to
talk
to
him
in
that
way
this
simplified
the
whole
affair
it
offered
him
the
release
which
he
now
knew
he
had
longed
for
as
he
stretched
himself
in
the
sheets
at
daybreak
he
told
himself
that
he
need
never
see
either
of
them
again
he
was
free
xxviii
lemuel
went
through
the
next
day
in
that
licence
of
revolt
which
every
human
soul
has
experienced
in
some
measure
at
some
time
we
look
back
at
it
afterwards
and
see
it
a
hideous
bondage
but
for
the
moment
lemuel
rejoiced
in
it
and
he
abandoned
himself
boldly
to
thoughts
that
had
hitherto
been
a
furtive
and
trembling
rapture
in
the
afternoon
when
he
was
most
at
leisure
he
walked
down
to
the
public
garden
and
found
a
seat
on
a
bench
near
the
fountain
where
the
venus
had
shocked
his
inexperience
the
first
time
he
saw
her
he
remembered
that
simple
boy
with
a
smile
of
pity
and
then
went
back
into
his
cloud
of
reverie
there
safely
hid
from
trouble
and
wrong
he
told
his
ideal
how
dear
she
was
to
him
and
how
she
had
shaped
and
governed
his
life
and
made
it
better
and
nobler
from
the
first
moment
they
had
met
the
fumes
of
the
romances
which
he
had
read
mixed
with
the
delirium
in
his
brain
he
was
no
longer
low
but
a
hero
of
lofty
line
kept
from
his
rightful
place
by
machinations
that
had
failed
at
last
and
now
he
was
leading
her
his
bride
into
the
ancient
halls
which
were
to
be
their
home
and
the
source
of
beneficence
and
hope
to
all
the
poor
and
around
them
his
eyes
were
so
full
of
this
fantastic
vision
the
soul
of
his
youth
dwelt
so
deeply
within
this
tabernacle
that
it
was
with
a
shock
of
anguish
he
saw
coming
up
the
walk
towards
him
the
young
girl
herself
his
airy
structure
fell
in
ruins
around
him
he
was
again
common
and
immeasurably
beneath
her
she
was
again
in
her
own
world
where
if
she
thought
of
him
at
all
it
must
be
as
a
squalid
vagabond
and
the
accomplice
of
a
thief
if
he
could
have
escaped
he
would
but
he
could
not
move
he
sat
still
and
waited
with
fallen
eyes
for
her
to
pass
him
at
sight
of
him
she
hesitated
and
wavered
then
she
came
towards
him
and
at
a
second
impulse
held
out
her
hand
smiling
with
a
radiant
pleasure
i
did
know
it
was
you
at
first
she
said
it
seems
so
strange
to
see
any
one
that
i
know
i
did
expect
to
see
you
either
he
stammered
out
getting
somehow
upon
his
feet
and
taking
her
hand
while
his
face
burned
and
he
could
not
keep
his
eyes
on
hers
i
did
know
you
were
i
only
been
here
a
few
days
i
drawing
at
the
museum
i
just
got
back
have
you
been
here
all
summer
yes
all
summer
i
hope
you
been
well
i
suppose
you
been
away
yes
i
just
got
back
she
repeated
oh
yes
i
meant
that
she
smiled
at
his
confusion
as
kindly
as
the
ideal
of
his
i
been
spending
the
summer
with
madeline
and
i
spent
most
of
it
sketching
have
you
been
well
yes
not
very
oh
yes
i
well
she
had
begun
to
move
forward
with
the
last
question
and
he
found
himself
walking
with
her
did
she
has
miss
swan
come
back
with
you
he
asked
looking
her
in
the
eyes
with
more
question
than
he
had
put
into
his
words
no
i
do
think
she
come
back
this
winter
said
the
girl
you
know
she
went
on
colouring
a
little
that
she
married
now
no
said
lemuel
yes
to
berry
and
i
have
a
letter
from
him
for
was
he
there
with
you
this
summer
asked
lemuel
ignoring
alike
berry
marriage
and
the
letter
from
him
oh
yes
of
course
and
i
liked
him
better
than
i
used
to
he
is
very
good
and
if
madeline
did
have
to
go
so
far
west
to
live
he
will
know
how
to
appreciate
her
and
there
are
not
many
who
can
do
that
her
father
thinks
he
has
a
great
deal
of
ability
yes
if
madeline
to
get
married
she
talked
as
if
convincing
and
consoling
herself
and
there
was
an
accent
of
loneliness
in
it
all
that
pierced
lemuel
preoccupation
he
had
hardly
noted
how
almost
pathetically
glad
she
was
to
see
him
you
miss
her
here
he
ventured
oh
i
do
dare
to
think
of
it
cried
the
girl
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
when
i
first
saw
you
just
now
it
brought
up
madeline
and
last
winter
so
that
it
seemed
too
much
to
bear
they
had
walked
out
of
the
garden
across
charles
street
and
were
climbing
the
slope
of
beacon
street
mall
in
the
common
i
suppose
she
continued
the
only
way
will
be
to
work
harder
and
try
to
forget
it
they
wanted
me
to
go
out
and
stay
with
them
but
of
course
i
could
i
shall
work
and
i
shall
read
i
shall
not
find
another
madeline
swan
you
must
have
been
reading
a
great
deal
this
summer
barker
she
said
in
turning
upon
him
from
her
bereavement
have
you
seen
any
of
the
old
boarders
or
harmon
i
shall
never
have
another
winter
like
that
at
the
poor
old
albans
lemuel
made
what
answer
he
could
there
was
happiness
enough
in
merely
being
with
her
to
have
counterbalanced
all
the
pain
he
was
suffering
and
when
she
made
him
partner
of
her
interests
and
associations
and
appealed
to
their
common
memories
in
confidence
of
his
sympathy
his
heavy
heart
stirred
with
strange
joy
he
had
supposed
that
berry
must
have
warned
her
against
him
but
she
was
treating
him
as
if
he
had
not
perhaps
he
had
not
and
perhaps
he
had
done
so
and
this
was
her
way
of
showing
that
she
did
not
believe
it
he
tried
to
think
so
he
knew
it
was
a
subterfuge
but
he
lingered
in
it
with
a
fleeting
fearful
pleasure
they
had
crossed
from
the
common
and
were
walking
up
under
the
lindens
of
chestnut
street
and
from
time
to
time
they
stopped
in
the
earnestness
of
their
parley
and
stood
talking
and
then
loitered
on
again
in
the
summer
security
from
oversight
which
they
were
too
rapt
to
recognise
they
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
and
came
to
a
door
where
she
stopped
he
fell
back
a
pace
it
was
eternal
loss
but
it
was
escape
she
smiled
in
timorous
hesitation
wo
you
come
in
and
i
will
get
berry
she
opened
the
door
with
a
and
he
followed
her
within
a
came
up
the
basement
stairs
to
see
who
it
was
and
then
went
down
she
left
him
in
the
dim
parlour
a
moment
while
she
went
to
get
the
letter
when
she
returned
i
have
a
little
room
for
my
work
at
the
top
of
the
house
she
said
but
it
will
never
be
like
the
albans
there
no
one
else
here
yet
and
it
pretty
lonesome
without
she
sank
into
a
chair
but
he
remained
standing
and
seemed
not
to
heed
her
when
she
asked
him
to
sit
down
he
put
berry
letter
into
his
pocket
without
looking
at
it
and
she
rose
again
she
must
have
thought
he
was
going
and
she
said
with
a
smile
of
gentle
trust
it
been
like
having
last
winter
back
again
to
see
you
we
thought
you
must
have
gone
home
right
after
the
fire
we
did
see
anything
of
you
again
we
went
ourselves
in
about
a
then
she
did
not
know
and
he
must
tell
her
himself
did
berry
say
anything
about
me
at
the
fire
that
last
day
he
began
bluntly
no
she
said
looking
at
him
with
surprise
there
was
a
new
sound
in
his
voice
he
had
no
need
to
say
anything
i
wanted
to
tell
you
to
write
and
tell
you
how
much
i
honoured
you
for
it
how
ashamed
i
was
for
misunderstanding
you
just
before
when
he
knew
that
she
meant
when
they
all
pitied
him
for
a
coward
her
voice
trembled
he
could
tell
that
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
he
tried
to
put
the
sweetness
of
her
praise
from
him
oh
it
was
that
that
i
meant
he
groaned
and
he
wrenched
the
words
out
that
fellow
who
said
he
was
a
friend
of
mine
and
got
into
the
house
that
way
was
a
thief
and
berry
caught
him
robbing
his
room
the
day
of
the
fire
and
treated
me
as
if
i
knew
it
and
was
helping
him
on
oh
cried
the
girl
how
cruel
how
could
he
do
that
lemuel
could
not
suffer
himself
to
take
refuge
in
her
generous
faith
now
when
i
first
came
to
boston
i
had
my
money
stolen
and
there
were
two
days
when
i
had
nothing
to
eat
and
then
i
was
arrested
by
mistake
for
stealing
a
girl
satchel
and
when
i
was
acquitted
i
slept
the
next
night
in
the
tramp
and
that
fellow
was
there
and
when
he
came
to
the
albans
i
was
ashamed
to
tell
where
i
had
known
him
and
so
i
let
him
pass
himself
off
for
my
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
hers
but
he
could
not
see
them
change
from
their
pity
of
him
or
light
up
with
a
sense
of
any
squalor
in
his
history
and
i
used
to
think
that
life
had
been
hard
she
cried
oh
how
much
you
have
been
through
and
after
that
he
pursued
mr
sewell
got
me
a
place
a
sort
of
servant
place
and
when
i
lost
that
i
came
to
be
the
work
at
the
in
her
eyes
the
pity
was
changing
to
admiration
his
confession
which
he
had
meant
to
be
so
abject
had
kindled
her
fancy
like
a
boastful
tale
how
little
we
know
about
people
and
what
they
have
suffered
but
i
thank
you
for
telling
me
this
oh
yes
and
i
shall
always
think
of
myself
with
contempt
how
easy
and
pleasant
my
life
has
been
and
you
she
stopped
and
he
stood
helpless
against
her
misconception
he
told
her
about
the
poverty
he
had
left
at
home
and
the
wretched
circumstance
of
his
life
but
she
could
not
see
it
as
anything
but
honourable
to
his
present
endeavour
she
listened
with
breathless
interest
to
it
all
and
well
she
sighed
at
last
it
will
always
be
something
for
you
to
look
back
to
and
be
proud
of
and
that
girl
did
she
never
say
or
do
anything
to
show
that
she
was
sorry
for
that
cruel
mistake
did
you
ever
see
her
afterwards
yes
said
lemuel
sick
at
heart
and
feeling
how
much
more
triumphantly
he
could
have
borne
ignominy
and
rejection
than
this
sweet
sympathy
she
seemed
to
think
he
would
say
something
more
but
he
turned
away
from
her
and
after
a
little
silence
of
expectance
she
let
him
go
with
promises
to
come
again
which
she
seemed
to
win
from
him
for
his
own
sake
in
the
street
he
took
out
berry
letter
and
read
it
dear
old
man
i
been
trying
to
get
off
a
letter
to
you
almost
any
time
the
last
three
months
but
i
been
round
so
much
and
upside
down
so
much
since
i
saw
you
out
to
and
on
my
head
in
western
that
i
not
been
able
to
fetch
it
i
do
know
as
i
could
fetch
it
now
if
it
was
for
the
prospective
standing
over
me
with
a
revolver
and
waiting
to
see
me
do
it
i
just
been
telling
her
about
that
little
interview
of
ours
with
williams
that
day
and
she
thinks
i
ought
to
be
man
enough
to
write
and
say
that
i
guess
i
was
all
wrong
about
you
i
had
a
sneaking
idea
of
the
kind
from
the
start
almost
but
if
a
fellow
proud
at
all
he
proud
of
his
mistakes
and
he
hates
to
give
them
up
i
pretty
badly
balled
up
now
and
i
ca
seem
to
get
the
right
words
about
remorse
and
so
forth
but
you
know
how
it
is
yourself
i
am
sorry
there
no
two
ways
about
that
but
i
kept
my
suspicions
as
well
as
my
regrets
to
myself
and
now
i
do
the
best
thing
i
can
by
way
of
reparation
i
send
this
letter
by
miss
carver
she
has
read
it
and
she
do
know
what
it
all
about
but
i
guess
you
better
tell
her
do
spare
yours
truly
berry
the
letter
did
not
soften
lemuel
at
all
towards
berry
and
he
was
bitterly
proud
that
he
had
spoken
without
this
bidding
though
he
had
seemed
to
speak
to
no
end
that
he
had
expected
after
a
while
he
lost
himself
in
his
again
and
in
the
fantastic
future
which
he
built
up
this
became
a
great
source
of
comfort
to
him
and
to
his
ideal
now
he
parted
with
her
in
sublime
renunciation
and
now
he
triumphed
over
all
the
obstacles
between
them
but
whatever
turn
he
willed
his
fortunes
to
take
she
still
praised
him
and
he
prided
himself
that
he
had
shown
himself
at
his
worst
to
her
of
his
own
free
impulse
sewell
praised
him
for
it
in
his
reverie
corey
and
bellingham
both
made
him
delicate
compliments
upon
his
noble
behaviour
which
he
feigned
had
somehow
become
known
to
them
xxix
at
the
usual
hour
he
was
at
corey
house
where
he
arrived
footsore
and
empty
from
supperless
wanderings
but
not
hungry
and
not
weary
the
at
the
door
met
him
with
the
message
that
corey
had
gone
to
dine
at
his
club
and
would
not
be
at
home
till
late
he
gave
lemuel
a
letter
which
had
all
the
greater
effect
from
being
presented
to
him
on
the
little
silver
tray
employed
to
bring
up
the
cards
and
notes
of
the
visitors
and
correspondents
of
the
family
the
envelope
was
stamped
in
that
ephemeral
taste
which
configured
the
stationery
of
a
few
years
ago
with
the
lines
of
alligator
leather
and
it
exhaled
a
perfume
so
characteristic
that
it
seemed
to
breathe
statira
visibly
before
him
he
knew
this
far
better
than
the
poor
scrawly
uncultivated
handwriting
which
he
had
seen
so
little
he
took
the
letter
and
turning
from
the
door
read
it
by
the
light
of
the
next
street
lamp
dear
lemuel
manda
grier
has
told
me
what
she
said
to
you

ime
about
crazy
about

suppose
i

of
let

if

but
of
course
you
dident
only
do
say
so
i
give
her
a
real
good
goen
over
and
she
says
shes
sory
she
done
it
i
dont
want
any
body

care
for

without
itse
there
free

but
i
shall
alwayes

if
you

but
if

i
want
you
should
come
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
i
can
explane
everything
manda
grier
dident
mean
anything
but
for
the
best
but
sometimes
she
dont
know
what
she
is
sayin
o
lem
you
mussent
be
mad
but
if
you
are
and
you
dont
want

come
ennymore
dont

but
o
i
hope
you
wouldent
let
such
a
thing
set
you
againste
mee
recollect
that
i
never
done
or
said
anything
to
set
you
against
me
a
cruel
disgust
mingled
with
the
remorse
that
this
letter
brought
him
its
illiteracy
made
him
ashamed
and
the
helpless
fondness
it
expressed
was
like
a
millstone
hanged
about
his
neck
he
felt
the
deadly
burden
of
it
drag
him
down
a
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
coughed
slightly
in
the
night
air
and
a
thought
flashed
through
lemuel
from
which
he
cowered
as
if
he
had
found
himself
lifting
his
hand
against
another
life
his
impulse
was
to
turn
and
run
but
there
was
no
escape
on
any
side
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
like
that
prisoner
he
had
read
of
who
saw
the
walls
of
his
cell
slowly
closing
together
upon
him
and
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
till
they
should
crush
him
between
them
the
inexperience
of
youth
denies
it
perspective
in
that
season
of
fleeting
and
unsubstantial
joys
of
feverish
hopes
despair
wholly
darkens
a
world
which
after
years
find
full
of
chances
and
expedients
if
sewell
had
been
in
town
there
might
have
been
some
hope
through
him
or
if
evans
were
there
or
even
if
berry
were
at
hand
it
would
be
some
one
to
advise
with
to
open
his
heart
to
in
his
extremity
he
walked
down
into
bolingbroke
street
knowing
well
that
sewell
was
not
at
home
but
pretending
to
himself
after
the
fashion
of
the
young
that
if
he
should
see
a
light
in
his
house
it
would
be
a
sign
that
all
should
come
out
right
with
him
and
if
not
it
would
come
out
wrong
he
would
not
let
himself
lift
his
eyes
to
the
house
front
till
he
arrived
before
it
when
he
looked
his
heart
stood
still
a
light
streamed
bright
and
strong
from
the
window
he
hurried
across
the
street
and
rang
and
after
some
delay
in
which
the
person
coming
to
the
door
took
time
to
light
the
gas
in
the
hall
sewell
himself
opened
to
him
they
stood
confronted
in
mutual
amazement
and
then
sewell
said
with
a
cordiality
which
he
did
not
keep
free
from
reluctance
oh
barker
come
in
come
in
but
after
they
had
shaken
hands
and
lemuel
had
come
in
he
stood
there
in
the
hall
with
him
and
did
not
offer
to
take
him
up
to
his
study
i
so
glad
to
have
this
glimpse
of
you
how
in
the
world
did
you
happen
to
come
i
was
passing
and
saw
the
light
said
lemuel
sewell
laughed
to
be
sure
we
never
have
any
idea
how
far
our
little
candle
throws
its
beams
i
just
here
for
the
night
on
my
way
from
the
mountains
to
the
sea
i
to
be
the
in
a
friend
pulpit
at
new
bedford
and
i
here
quite
alone
in
the
house
scrambling
a
sermon
together
but
i
glad
to
see
you
you
well
i
hope
looking
a
little
thin
but
that
no
harm
do
you
enjoy
your
life
with
corey
i
was
sure
you
would
when
you
come
to
know
him
you
will
find
him
one
of
the
best
of
men
kindly
thoughtful
and
sympathetic
i
felt
very
comfortable
about
your
being
with
him
whenever
thought
of
you
and
you
may
be
sure
that
i
thought
of
you
often
what
about
our
friends
of
the
albans
do
you
see
harmon
you
knew
the
evanses
had
gone
to
yes
i
got
a
letter
from
him
he
did
pick
up
so
fast
as
they
hoped
and
he
concluded
to
try
the
voyage
i
hear
very
good
accounts
of
him
he
said
he
was
going
to
write
you
well
and
corey
is
well
he
smiled
more
beamingly
upon
lemuel
who
felt
that
he
wished
him
to
go
and
stood
haplessly
trying
to
get
away
in
the
midst
of
his
own
uneasiness
sewell
noted
lemuel
is
there
anything
something
you
wished
to
speak
with
me
about
no
no
not
anything
in
particular
i
just
saw
the
light
and
sewell
took
his
hand
and
wrung
it
with
affection
it
was
so
good
of
you
to
run
in
and
see
me
do
fancy
it
been
any
disturbance
i
got
into
rather
a
dim
place
in
my
work
but
since
i
been
standing
here
with
you
ha
ha
ha
those
things
do
happen
so
curiously
the
whole
thing
has
become
perfectly
luminous
i
delighted
you
getting
on
so
nicely
give
my
love
to
corey
i
shall
see
you
soon
again
we
shall
all
be
back
in
a
little
over
a
fortnight
glad
of
this
moment
with
you
if
it
only
a
moment
he
wrung
lemuel
hand
again
this
time
in
perfect
sincerity
and
eagerly
shut
him
out
into
the
night
the
dim
place
had
not
become
so
luminous
to
him
as
it
had
to
the
minister
a
darkness
which
the
obscurity
of
the
night
faintly
typified
closed
round
him
pierced
by
one
ray
only
and
from
this
he
tried
to
turn
his
face
it
was
the
gleam
that
lights
up
every
labyrinth
where
our
feet
wander
and
stumble
but
it
is
not
always
easy
to
know
it
from
those
false
lights
of
pity
of
of
sick
conscience
which
dance
before
us
to
betray
to
worse
misery
yet
some
sense
of
this
broken
and
faltering
reached
lemuel
where
he
stood
and
tried
to
deal
faithfully
with
his
problem
in
that
one
steadfast
ray
he
saw
that
whatever
he
did
he
must
not
do
it
for
himself
but
what
his
duty
was
he
could
not
make
out
he
knew
now
if
he
had
not
known
before
that
whatever
his
feeling
for
statira
was
he
had
not
released
himself
from
her
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
not
release
himself
by
any
concern
for
his
own
advantage
that
notion
with
which
he
had
so
long
played
her
insufficiency
for
his
life
now
and
for
the
needs
of
his
mind
hereafter
revealed
itself
in
its
real
cruelty
the
things
that
sewell
had
said
that
his
mother
had
said
that
berry
had
said
in
what
seemed
a
fatal
succession
and
all
to
the
same
effect
against
throwing
himself
away
upon
some
one
inadequate
to
him
at
his
best
fell
to
the
ground
like
withered
leaves
and
the
fire
of
that
steadfast
ray
consumed
them
but
whom
to
turn
to
for
counsel
now
the
one
friend
in
whom
he
had
trusted
to
whom
he
had
just
gone
ready
to
fling
down
his
whole
heart
before
him
had
failed
him
failed
him
unwittingly
unwillingly
as
he
had
failed
him
once
before
but
this
time
in
infinitely
greater
stress
he
did
not
blame
him
now
fiercely
proudly
as
he
had
once
blamed
him
but
again
he
wandered
up
and
down
the
city
streets
famished
and
outcast
through
his
defection
it
was
late
when
he
went
home
but
corey
had
not
yet
returned
and
he
had
time
to
sit
down
and
write
the
letter
which
he
had
decided
to
send
to
statira
instead
of
going
to
see
her
it
was
not
easy
to
write
but
after
many
attempts
he
wrote
it
dear
statira
you
must
not
be
troubled
at
what
amanda
said
to
me
i
assure
you
that
although
i
was
angry
at
first
i
am
entirely
willing
to
overlook
it
at
your
request
she
probably
spoke
hastily
and
i
am
now
convinced
that
she
spoke
without
your
authority
you
must
not
think
that
i
am
provoked
at
you
i
received
your
letter
this
evening
and
i
will
come
to
see
you
very
soon
lemuel
the
letter
was
colder
than
he
meant
to
make
it
but
he
felt
that
he
must
above
all
be
honest
and
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
honestly
make
it
less
cold
when
it
came
to
statira
hands
she
read
it
silently
to
herself
over
and
over
again
while
her
tears
dripped
upon
it
grier
was
by
and
she
watched
her
till
she
could
bear
the
sight
no
longer
she
snatched
the
letter
from
the
girl
hands
and
ran
it
through
and
then
she
flung
it
on
the
ground
nasty
shameless
thing
oh
do
do
sobbed
statira
and
she
plunged
her
face
into
the
pillows
of
the
bed
where
she
sat
shameless
nasty
thing
said
grier
varying
her
denunciation
in
the
repetition
and
apparently
getting
fresh
satisfaction
out
of
it
in
that
way
do
dudley
if
you
was
a
woman
if
you
was
a
woman
you
never
speak
to
that
little
o
do

you
talk
so
moaned
statira

not

i
was
provoked
with
you
she
mimicked
lemuel
dignity
of
diction
in
mincing
falsetto
will
come
to
see
you
very
soon
miserable
worthless
conceited
o
you
break
my
heart
if
you
go
on
so
well
then

kill
me
to
give
him
she
had
lifted
herself
from
the
pillow
and
she
began
to
cough
he
kill
you
anyway
cried
grier
in
a
passion
of
pity
and
remorse
she
ran
across
the
room
to
get
the
medicine
which
statira
had
to
take
in
these
paroxysms
there
there
take
it
i
say
anything
more
about
and
do
you
take
it
all
back
gasped
statira
holding
the
proffered
spoon
away
yes
yes
but
do
take
your
you
do
want
to
die
where
you
and
do
you
think
he
come
yes
he
do
you
say
it
just
to
get
me
to
take
the
medicine
no
i
really
do
believe
he
o
statira
took
her
medicine
and
then
wildly
flung
her
arms
round
grier
neck
and
began
to
sob
and
to
cry
there
oh
how
hard
i
am
with
you
manda
i
should
think
if
i
was
as
hard
with
everybody
else
they
perfectly
hate
you
hard
yes
and
that
why
he
hate
me
he
does
hate
me
you
said
he
no
i
did
you
never

hard
to
anybody
and
the
meanest
old
iceberg
in
creation
could
hate
then
you
think
he
does
care
for
me
and
you
know
he
come
soon
yes
xxx
lemuel
had
promised
himself
that
if
he
could
gain
a
little
time
he
should
be
able
better
to
decide
what
it
was
right
for
him
to
do
his
heart
lifted
as
he
dropped
the
letter
into
the
box
and
he
went
through
the
chapters
which
corey
asked
him
to
read
after
he
came
in
with
an
ease
incredible
to
himself
in
the
morning
he
woke
with
a
mind
that
was
almost
cheerful
he
had
been
honest
in
writing
that
letter
and
so
far
he
had
done
right
he
should
keep
his
word
about
going
soon
to
see
statira
and
that
would
be
honest
too
he
did
not
look
beyond
this
decision
and
he
felt
as
we
all
do
more
or
less
vaguely
when
we
have
resolved
to
do
right
that
he
had
the
merit
of
a
good
action
statira
showed
herself
so
glad
to
see
him
that
he
could
not
do
less
than
seem
to
share
her
joy
in
their
as
she
called
it
though
he
insisted
that
there
had
been
no
quarrel
between
them
and
now
there
began
for
him
a
strange
double
life
the
fact
of
which
each
reader
must
reject
or
accept
according
to
the
witness
of
his
own
knowledge
he
renewed
as
far
as
he
could
the
old
warmth
of
his
feeling
for
statira
and
in
his
compunction
experienced
a
tenderness
for
her
that
he
had
not
known
before
the
strange
tenderness
that
some
spirits
feel
for
those
they
injure
he
went
oftener
than
ever
to
see
her
he
was
very
good
to
her
and
cheered
her
with
his
interest
in
all
her
little
interests
he
petted
her
and
comforted
her
but
he
escaped
from
her
as
soon
as
he
could
and
when
he
shut
her
door
behind
him
he
shut
her
within
it
he
made
haste
to
forget
her
and
to
lose
himself
in
thoughts
that
were
never
wholly
absent
even
in
her
presence
sometimes
he
went
directly
from
her
to
jessie
whose
innocent
bohemianism
kept
later
hours
and
who
was
always
glad
to
see
him
whenever
he
came
she
welcomed
him
with
talk
that
they
thought
related
wholly
to
the
books
they
had
been
reading
and
to
the
things
of
deep
psychological
import
which
they
suggested
he
seldom
came
to
her
without
the
excuse
of
a
book
to
be
lent
or
borrowed
and
he
never
quitted
her
without
feeling
inspired
with
the
wish
to
know
more
and
to
be
more
he
seemed
to
be
lifted
to
purer
and
clearer
regions
of
thought
she
received
him
in
the
parlour
but
their
evenings
commonly
ended
in
her
little
studio
whither
some
errand
took
them
or
some
intrusion
of
the
other
boarders
banished
them
there
he
read
to
her
poems
or
long
chapters
out
of
the
essayists
or
romancers
or
else
they
sat
and
talked
about
the
strange
things
they
had
noticed
in
themselves
that
were
like
the
things
they
found
in
their
books
once
when
they
had
talked
a
long
while
in
this
strain
he
told
how
when
he
first
saw
her
he
thought
she
was
very
proud
and
cold
she
laughed
gaily
and
i
used
to
be
afraid
of
you
she
said
you
used
to
be
always
reading
there
in
your
little
office
do
you
think
i
very
proud
now
are
you
very
much
afraid
of
me
now
he
retorted
they
laughed
together
is
it
strange
she
said
how
little
we
really
know
about
people
in
the
world
yes
he
answered
i
wonder
if
it
will
ever
be
different
i
been
wrong
about
nearly
every
one
i
met
since
i
came
to
and
i
have
too
she
cried
with
that
delight
in
the
coincidence
of
experience
which
the
young
feel
so
keenly
he
had
got
the
habit
with
his
growing
ease
in
her
presence
of
walking
up
and
down
the
room
while
she
sat
with
her
arms
lifted
and
clasped
above
her
head
forgetful
of
everything
but
the
things
they
were
saying
and
followed
him
with
her
eyes
as
he
turned
about
in
his
walk
he
saw
how
pretty
she
was
with
her
slender
form
cased
in
the
black
silk
she
wore
and
thrown
into
full
relief
by
the
lifted
arms
he
saw
the
little
hands
knit
above
her
head
and
white
as
flowers
on
her
dark
hair
her
eyes
were
very
bright
and
her
soft
lips
small
and
fine
were
red
he
faltered
and
lost
the
thread
of
his
speech
i
forgot
what
i
was
going
to
say
she
took
down
her
hands
to
clasp
them
over
her
laughing
face
a
moment
and
i
do
remember
what
you
were
saying
they
both
laughed
a
long
time
at
this
it
seemed
incomparably
droll
and
they
became
better
comrades
they
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
laughing
and
joking
i
did
know
you
were
so
fond
of
laughing
he
said
when
he
went
away
and
i
always
supposed
you
were
very
solemn
she
replied
this
again
seemed
the
drollest
thing
in
the
world
well
i
always
was
he
said
and
i
do
know
when
i
laughed
so
much
before
she
stood
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
held
her
lamp
up
for
him
to
find
his
way
down
again
looking
back
he
saw
her
in
the
undefended
grace
that
had
bewildered
him
before
when
he
came
next
they
met
very
seriously
but
before
the
evening
was
past
they
were
laughing
together
and
so
it
happened
now
whenever
he
came
they
both
said
how
strange
it
was
that
laughing
with
any
one
seemed
to
make
you
feel
so
much
better
acquainted
she
told
of
a
girl
at
school
that
she
had
always
disliked
till
one
day
something
made
them
laugh
and
after
that
they
became
the
greatest
friends
he
tried
to
think
of
some
experience
to
match
this
but
he
could
not
he
asked
her
if
she
did
not
think
that
you
always
felt
a
little
gloomy
after
you
had
been
laughing
a
great
deal
she
said
yes
after
that
first
night
when
they
laughed
so
she
felt
so
depressed
that
she
was
sure
she
was
going
to
have
bad
news
from
madeline
then
she
said
she
had
received
a
letter
from
madeline
that
morning
and
she
and
berry
had
both
wished
her
to
give
him
their
regards
if
she
ever
saw
him
this
when
she
had
said
it
seemed
a
very
good
joke
too
and
they
laughed
at
it
a
little
consciously
till
he
boldly
bade
her
tell
them
he
came
so
very
seldom
that
she
did
not
know
when
she
could
deliver
their
message
she
answered
that
she
was
afraid
madeline
would
not
believe
that
and
then
it
came
out
that
he
had
never
replied
to
berry
letter
she
said
oh
is
that
the
way
you
treat
your
correspondents
and
he
was
ashamed
to
confess
that
he
had
not
forgiven
berry
i
will
write
to
him
if
you
say
so
he
answered
hardily
oh
you
must
do
what
you
think
best
she
said
lightly
refusing
the
responsibility
whatever
you
say
will
be
best
he
said
with
a
sudden
passionate
fervour
that
surprised
himself
she
tried
to
escape
from
it
am
i
so
infallible
as
that
you
are
for
me
he
retorted
a
silence
followed
which
she
endeavoured
to
break
but
she
sat
still
across
the
little
table
from
him
where
the
shaded
lamp
spread
its
glow
leaving
the
rest
of
the
room
with
its
red
curtains
and
its
sketches
pinned
about
in
a
warm
luxurious
shadow
her
eyes
fell
and
she
did
not
speak
it
must
sound
very
strange
to
you
i
know
he
went
on
and
strange
to
me
too
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
anything
done
without
my
thinking
whether
you
would
like
me
to
do
she
rose
involuntarily
you
make
me
ashamed
to
think
that
you
so
much
mistaken
about
me
i
know
how
we
all
influence
each
other
i
know
i
always
try
to
be
what
i
think
people
expect
me
to
be
i
ca
be
myself
i
know
what
you
mean
but
you
you
must
be
yourself
and
not
let
she
stopped
in
her
wandering
speech
in
strange
agitation
and
he
rose
too
i
hope
you
not
offended
with
me
offended
why
why
do
you
go
so
soon
i
thought
you
were
going
he
answered
stupidly
why
i
at
they
looked
at
each
other
and
then
they
broke
into
a
happy
laugh
sit
down
again
i
do
know
what
i
got
up
for
it
must
have
been
to
make
some
tea
did
you
know
madeline
had
bequeathed
me
her
the
one
we
had
at
the
albans
she
bustled
about
and
lit
the
under
the
kettle
blow
out
that
match
he
cried
you
set
your
dress
on
fire
he
caught
her
hand
which
she
was
holding
with
the
lighted
match
in
it
at
her
side
after
the
manner
of
women
with
lighted
matches
and
blew
it
out
himself
oh
thank
you
she
said
indifferently
can
you
take
it
without
milk
yes
i
like
it
she
got
out
two
of
the
cups
he
remembered
and
he
said
how
much
like
last
winter
that
seems
and
yes
does
it
she
sighed
the
lamp
purred
and
fretted
under
the
kettle
and
in
the
silence
in
which
they
waited
the
elm
tree
that
rose
from
the
pavement
outside
seemed
to
look
in
consciously
upon
them
when
the
kettle
began
to
sing
she
poured
out
the
two
cups
of
tea
and
in
handing
him
his
their
fingers
touched
and
she
gave
a
little
outcry
oh
madeline
precious
cup
i
thought
it
was
going
to
drop
the
soft
blew
in
through
the
elm
leaves
and
their
rustling
seemed
the
expression
of
a
profound
repose
an
endless
content
xxxi
the
next
night
lemuel
went
to
see
statira
without
promising
himself
what
he
should
say
or
do
but
if
he
were
to
tell
her
everything
he
felt
that
she
would
forgive
him
more
easily
than
grier
he
was
aware
that
always
lay
in
wait
for
him
to
pierce
him
at
every
undefended
hint
of
conscience
since
the
first
break
with
her
there
had
never
been
peace
between
them
and
perhaps
not
kindness
for
long
before
that
whether
or
not
she
felt
responsible
for
having
promoted
affair
with
him
and
therefore
bound
to
guard
her
to
the
utmost
from
suffering
by
it
she
seemed
always
to
be
on
the
alert
to
seize
any
advantage
against
him
sometimes
statira
accused
her
of
trying
to
act
so
hatefully
to
him
that
he
would
never
come
any
more
she
wildly
blamed
her
but
the
faithful
creature
was
none
the
less
constant
and
vigilant
on
that
account
she
took
patiently
the
unjust
reproaches
which
statira
heaped
upon
her
like
a
wayward
child
and
remitted
nothing
of
her
suspicion
or
enmity
towards
lemuel
once
when
she
had
been
very
bitter
with
him
so
bitter
that
it
had
ended
in
an
open
quarrel
between
them
statira
sided
with
him
against
her
and
when
grier
flounced
out
of
the
room
she
offered
him
if
he
wished
to
break
with
her
and
never
to
speak
to
her
again
or
have
anything
more
to
do
with
such
a
person
but
at
this
his
anger
somehow
fell
and
he
said
no
she
must
not
think
of
such
a
thing
that
grier
had
been
her
friend
long
before
he
was
and
that
whatever
she
said
to
him
she
was
always
good
and
true
to
her
then
statira
fell
upon
his
neck
and
cried
and
praised
him
and
said
he
was
a
million
times
more
to
her
than
grier
but
she
would
do
whatever
he
said
and
he
went
away
sick
at
heart
when
he
came
now
with
his
thoughts
clinging
to
jessie
grier
hardly
gave
him
time
for
the
decencies
of
greeting
she
was
in
a
high
nervous
exaltation
and
statira
looked
as
if
she
had
been
crying
what
become
o
them
you
used
to
have
the
albans
she
began
her
twitching
with
excitement
and
her
eyes
glaring
vindictively
upon
lemuel
he
had
sat
down
near
statira
on
the
lounge
but
she
drew
a
little
away
from
him
in
a
provisional
fashion
as
if
she
would
first
see
what
came
of
grier
inquisition
he
repeated
aimlessly
while
he
felt
his
colour
go
yes
she
snapped
them
girls
used
to
be
the
albans
you
thought
so
wonderful
i
did
know
i
thought
they
were
very
wonderful
ca
you
answer
a
civil
question
she
demanded
raising
her
voice
i
have
heard
any
said
lemuel
with
sullen
scorn
oh
well
she
sneered
i
forgot
that
you
used
to
goin
with
such
fine
folks
that
you
ca
bear
to
be
spoken
to
in
plain
began
statira
with
an
incipient
whimper
you
be
still
dudley
barker
said
the
poor
foolish
thing
in
the
mincing
falsetto
which
she
thought
so
cutting
have
you
any
idea
what
become
of
your
young
lady
artist
friends
them
that
took
your
portrait
as
a
roman
youth
you
know
lemuel
made
no
answer
whatever
for
a
time
then
whether
he
judged
it
best
to
do
so
or
was
goaded
to
the
defiance
by
grier
manner
he
replied
miss
swan
and
miss
carver
miss
swan
is
married
and
lives
in
wyoming
territory
before
he
had
reached
the
close
of
the
sentence
he
had
controlled
himself
sufficiently
to
be
speaking
quite
calmly
oh
indeed
barker
and
may
i
ask
where
miss
carver
is
she
merried
and
living
in
wyoming
territory
too
no
said
lemuel
quietly
she
not
married
she
in
indeed
then
it
her
i
see
in
the
garden
she
back
long
barker
about
a
month
i
think
said
lemuel
quite
a
spell
seen
her
barker
yes
quite
i
want
to
know
she
still
paintin
roman
boys
barker
did
seem
to
make
any
great
out
at
it
last
winter
but
practice
makes
perfect
they
say
i
seen
her
in
the
garden
too
i
usually
see
her
at
home
said
lemuel
probably
receive
your
friends
on
the
benches
in
the
garden
but
young
ladies
prefer
to
have
them
call
at
their
he
astonished
himself
by
this
brutality
he
who
was
all
gentleness
with
miss
carver
very
well
barker
that
all
right
that
all
i
wanted
to
know
never
mind
about
where
i
meet
my
friends
wherever
it
is
and
they
ai
generally
goin
with
three
or
four
girls
the
same
no
one
like
you
would
be
enough
retorted
lemuel
statira
sat
cowering
away
from
the
quarrel
and
making
little
ineffectual
starts
as
if
to
stay
it
heretofore
their
enmity
had
been
covert
if
not
tacit
in
her
presence
lemuel
saw
her
wavering
and
the
wish
to
show
his
superior
power
triumphed
over
every
other
interest
and
impulse
in
him
he
got
upon
his
feet
there
is
no
use
in
this
sort
of
thing
going
on
any
longer
i
came
here
because
i
thought
i
was
wanted
if
it
a
mistake
it
easy
enough
to
mend
it
and
it
easy
not
to
make
it
again
i
wish
you
good
statira
sprang
from
the
lounge
and
flung
her
arms
around
his
neck
no
no
you
go
you
must
go
lem
i
know
your
all
right
and
i
wo
have
you
talked
to
so
i
ai
a
bit
jealous
lem
indeed
i
ai
i
know
you
would
fool
with
me
any
more
than
i
would
with
you
and
that
what
i
tell
grier
i
leave
it
to
her
if
i
do
i
do
care
who
you
go
with
and
i
hai
never
since
that
first
time
i
know
you
ai
goin
to
do
anything
underhanded
do
go
lem
oh
go
he
was
pulling
towards
the
door
her
trust
her
fond
generosity
drove
him
more
than
grier
cutting
tongue
that
hurt
his
pride
his
vanity
but
this
pierced
his
soul
he
had
only
a
blind
stupid
will
to
escape
from
it
statira
was
crying
she
began
to
cough
she
released
his
neck
from
her
clasp
and
reeled
backward
to
the
lounge
where
she
would
have
fallen
if
grier
had
not
caught
her
the
paroxysm
grew
more
violent
a
bright
stream
of
blood
sprang
from
her
lips
run
run
for
the
doctor
quick
lemuel
oh
quick
implored
grier
forgetting
all
enmity
in
her
terror
statira
arms
wavered
towards
him
as
if
to
keep
him
but
he
turned
and
ran
from
the
house
cowed
and
by
the
sight
of
that
blood
as
if
he
had
shed
it
he
did
not
expect
to
see
statira
alive
when
he
came
back
with
the
doctor
whom
he
found
at
the
next
apothecary
she
was
lying
on
the
lounge
white
as
death
but
breathing
quietly
and
her
eyes
sought
him
with
an
eagerness
that
turned
to
a
look
of
tender
gratitude
at
the
look
they
found
in
his
the
doctor
bent
over
her
for
her
pulse
and
her
respiration
then
when
he
turned
to
examine
the
crimson
handkerchief
which
grier
showed
him
lemuel
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
her
and
put
his
face
down
to
hers
with
her
lips
against
his
cheek
she
made
do
go
and
he
whispered
no
i
not
leave
you
now
the
doctor
looked
round
with
the
handkerchief
still
in
his
hand
as
if
doubting
whether
to
order
him
away
from
her
then
he
mutely
questioned
grier
with
a
glance
which
her
glance
answered
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
puzzled
sigh
an
expression
of
pity
crossed
his
face
which
he
hardened
into
one
of
purely
professional
interest
and
he
went
on
questioning
grier
in
a
low
tone
statira
had
slipped
her
hand
into
lemuel
and
she
held
it
fast
as
if
in
that
clasp
she
were
holding
on
to
her
chance
of
life
xxxii
sewell
returned
to
town
for
the
last
time
in
the
third
week
of
september
bringing
his
family
with
him
this
was
before
the
greater
part
of
his
oddly
assorted
congregation
had
thought
of
leaving
the
country
either
the
rich
cottagers
whose
family
tradition
or
liberal
opinions
kept
them
in
his
church
or
the
boarding
and
camping
elements
who
were
uniting
a
love
of
cheapness
with
a
love
of
nature
in
their
prolonged
sojourn
among
the
woods
and
fields
certain
families
perhaps
half
of
his
parish
in
all
were
returning
because
the
schools
were
opening
and
they
must
put
their
children
into
them
and
it
was
both
to
minister
to
the
spiritual
needs
of
these
and
to
get
his
own
children
back
to
their
studies
that
the
minister
was
at
home
so
early
it
was
as
i
have
hinted
already
a
difficult
and
laborious
season
with
him
he
himself
was
always
a
little
rusty
in
his
vocation
after
his
summer
outing
and
felt
weakened
rather
than
strengthened
by
his
rest
the
domestic
machine
started
reluctantly
there
was
a
new
cook
to
be
got
in
and
sewell
had
to
fight
a
battle
with
herself
in
which
she
invited
him
to
share
before
she
could
settle
down
for
the
winter
to
the
cares
of
housekeeping
the
wide
skies
the
dim
mountain
slopes
the
long
delicious
drives
the
fresh
mornings
the
sweet
silvery
afternoons
of
their
idle
country
life
haunted
their
nerves
and
enfeebled
their
wills
one
evening
in
the
first
days
of
this
moral
disability
while
sewell
sat
at
his
desk
trying
to
get
himself
together
for
a
sermon
barker
name
was
brought
up
to
him
really
said
his
wife
who
had
transmitted
it
from
the
maid

boston

two
years
now

has
regular
employment

if
there
anything

him

ought
to
prosper
and
improve
without
coming
to
you
every
other
night
what
he
want
now
i
sure
i
do
know
said
the
minister
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
passing
his
hand
wearily
over
his
forehead
then
send
down
and
excuse
yourself
tell
him
you
busy
and
ask
him
to
come
another
time
ah

him
very
he
went
stupidly
back
to
his
writing
without
looking
to
see
whether
his
wife
had
meant
all
she
said
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
descended
in
fulfilment
of
her
promise
or
perhaps
rather
it
was
a
threat
she
met
lemuel
not
unkindly
for
she
was
a
woman
but
she
placed
duty
before
charity
even
and
she
could
not
help
making
him
feel
that
she
was
there
in
the
discharge
of
a
duty
she
explained
that
sewell
was
very
unusually
busy
that
evening
and
had
sent
her
in
his
place
and
hoped
soon
to
see
him
she
bade
lemuel
sit
down
and
he
obeyed
answering
all
the
questions
as
to
the
summer
and
his
occupations
and
health
and
his
mother
health
which
she
put
to
him
in
proof
of
her
interest
in
him
in
further
evidence
of
it
she
gave
him
an
account
of
the
sewell
family
doings
since
they
last
met
he
did
not
stay
long
and
she
returned
slowly
and
pensively
to
her
husband
well
he
asked
without
looking
round
well
it
all
right
she
answered
with
rather
a
deep
breath
he
did
seem
to
have
come
for
anything
in
particular
i
told
him
that
if
he
wished
specially
to
speak
with
you
you
would
come
sewell
went
on
with
his
writing
and
after
a
moment
his
wife
said
but
you
must
go
and
see
him
very
soon
david
you
must
go
why
he
looks
wretchedly
though
he
says
he
very
well
it
made
my
heart
ache
he
looks
perfectly
wan
and
haggard
i
wish
she
burst
out
i
wish
i
had
let
you
go
down
and
see
him
why
why
what
was
the
matter
asked
sewell
turning
about
now
did
you
think
he
had
something
on
his
mind
no
but
he
looked
fairly
sick
oh
i
wish
he
had
never
come
into
our
lives
i
afraid
he
has
got
much
good
from
us
sighed
the
minister
but
i
go
round
and
look
him
up
in
the
morning
his
trouble
will
keep
overnight
if
it
a
real
trouble
there
that
comfort
at
least
and
now
do
go
away
my
dear
and
leave
me
to
my
sewell
looked
at
him
but
turned
and
left
him
apparently
reserving
whatever
sermon
she
might
have
in
her
mind
till
he
should
have
finished
his
the
next
morning
he
went
to
inquire
for
lemuel
at
corey
the
man
was
sending
him
away
from
the
door
with
the
fact
merely
that
lemuel
was
not
then
in
the
house
when
the
voice
of
corey
descending
the
stairs
called
from
within
is
that
you
sewell
do
go
away
come
in
the
old
gentleman
took
him
into
the
library
and
confessed
in
a
bit
of
new
slang
which
he
said
was
delightful
that
he
was
all
balled
up
by
lemuel
leaving
him
and
asked
sewell
what
he
supposed
it
meant
left
you
meant
echoed
sewell
when
they
got
at
each
other
it
was
understood
that
lemuel
the
day
before
had
given
up
his
employment
with
corey
expressing
a
fit
sense
of
all
his
kindness
and
a
fit
regret
at
leaving
him
but
alleging
no
reasons
for
his
course
and
that
this
was
the
first
that
sewell
knew
of
the
affair
it
must
have
been
that
which
he
came
to
see
me
about
last
night
he
said
with
a
sort
of
anticipative
remorse
mrs
sewell
saw
him
i
was
well
get
him
to
come
back
sewell
said
corey
with
his
whimsical
imperiousness
i
ca
get
on
without
him
all
my
moral
and
intellectual
being
has
stopped
like
a
sewell
went
to
the
where
lemuel
took
his
meals
but
found
that
he
no
longer
came
there
and
had
left
no
other
address
he
knew
nowhere
else
to
ask
and
he
went
home
to
a
day
of
latent
trouble
of
mind
which
whenever
it
came
to
the
light
defined
itself
as
helpless
question
and
in
regard
to
barker
that
evening
as
he
sat
at
tea
the
maid
came
with
the
announcement
that
there
was
a
person
in
the
who
would
not
send
in
any
name
but
wished
to
see
sewell
and
would
wait
sewell
threw
down
his
napkin
and
said
i
bring
him
in
to
sewell
did
not
resist
she
bade
the
girl
lay
another
plate
sewell
was
so
sure
of
finding
lemuel
in
the
that
he
recoiled
in
dismay
from
the
girlish
figure
that
turned
timidly
from
the
window
to
meet
him
with
a
face
thickly
veiled
he
was
vexed
too
here
he
knew
from
the
mystery
put
on
was
one
of
those
cases
of
feminine
trouble
real
or
unreal
which
he
most
disliked
to
meddle
with
will
you
sit
down
he
said
as
kindly
as
he
could
and
the
girl
obeyed
i
thought
they
would
let
me
wait
i
did
mean
to
interrupt
you
she
began
in
a
voice
singularly
gentle
and
unaffected
oh
no
matter
cried
sewell
i
very
glad
to
see
i
thought
you
could
help
me
i
in
great
trouble
doubt
the
voice
was
almost
childlike
in
its
appealing
innocence
sewell
sat
down
opposite
the
girl
and
bent
sympathetically
forward
well
she
waited
a
moment
then
i
do
know
how
to
begin
she
said
hoarsely
and
stopped
again
sewell
was
touched
he
forgot
lemuel
he
forgot
everything
but
the
heartache
which
he
divined
before
him
and
his
office
his
holy
privilege
of
helping
any
in
want
of
comfort
or
guidance
perhaps
he
said
in
his
loveliest
way
the
way
that
had
won
his
wife
heart
and
that
still
provoked
her
severest
criticism
for
its
insincerity
it
was
so
purely
impersonal
perhaps
that
necessary
if
you
mean
beginning
at
the
beginning
if
you
any
trouble
that
you
think
i
can
advise
you
in
perhaps
it
better
for
both
of
us
that
i
should
know
very
much
of
yes
murmured
the
girl
questioningly
i
mean
that
if
you
tell
me
much
you
will
go
away
feeling
that
you
have
somehow
parted
with
yourself
that
you
no
longer
in
your
own
keeping
but
in
mine
and
you
know
that
in
everything
our
help
must
really
come
from
within
our
own
free
yes
said
the
girl
again
from
behind
the
veil
which
completely
hid
her
face
she
now
hesitated
a
long
time
she
put
her
handkerchief
under
her
veil
and
at
last
she
said
i
know
what
you
her
voice
quivered
pathetically
she
tried
to
control
it
perhaps
she
whispered
huskily
after
another
interval
i
can
put
it
in
the
form
of
a
that
would
be
best
said
sewell
she
hesitated
the
tears
fell
down
upon
her
hands
behind
her
veil
she
no
longer
wiped
them
it
because
i
often
heard
you
because
i
know
you
will
tell
me
what
true
and
right
your
own
heart
must
do
that
said
the
minister
but
i
will
gladly
help
you
all
i
she
did
not
heed
him
now
but
continued
as
if
rapt
quite
away
from
him
if
there
was
some
one
something
if
there
was
something
that
it
would
be
right
for
you
to
do
to
have
if
there
was
no
one
else
but
if
there
were
some
else
that
had
a
right
first
she
broke
off
and
asked
abruptly
do
you
think
it
is
always
right
to
prefer
another
the
interest
of
another
to
your
own
sewell
could
not
help
smiling
there
is
only
one
thing
for
us
to
do
when
we
are
in
any
doubt
or
perplexity
he
said
cheerily
and
that
is
the
unselfish
yes
she
gasped
she
seemed
to
be
speaking
to
herself
i
saw
it
i
knew
it
even
if
it
kills
us
we
must
do
it
nothing
ought
to
weigh
against
it
oh
i
thank
you
sewell
was
puzzled
he
felt
dimly
that
she
was
thanking
him
for
anguish
and
despair
i
afraid
that
i
do
quite
understand
i
thought
i
told
you
she
answered
with
a
certain
reproach
and
a
fall
of
courage
in
view
of
the
fresh
effort
she
must
make
it
was
some
moments
before
she
could
say
if
you
knew
that
some
one
some
one
who
was
everything
to
you
and
that
you
knew
believed
at
fifty
it
is
hard
to
be
serious
about
these
things
and
it
was
well
for
the
girl
that
she
was
no
longer
conscious
of
sewell
mood
cared
for
you
and
if
you
knew
that
before
he
had
cared
for
you
there
had
been
some
else
some
else
that
he
was
as
much
to
as
he
was
to
you
and
that
could
give
him
up
what
should
you
sewell
fetched
a
long
sigh
of
relief
he
had
been
afraid
of
a
much
darker
problem
than
this
he
almost
smiled
my
dear
child
she
seemed
but
a
child
there
before
the
mature
man
with
her
poor
little
so
intricate
and
hopeless
to
her
so
simple
and
easy
to
him
that
depends
upon
a
great
many
he
could
feel
through
her
veil
the
surprise
with
which
she
turned
to
him
you
said
whenever
we
are
in
doubt
we
must
act
yes
i
said
that
but
you
must
first
be
sure
what
is
really
selfish
i
what
is
selfish
in
this
case
said
the
girl
with
a
sublimity
which
if
foolish
was
still
sublimity
she
is
sick
it
will
kill
her
to
lose
him
you
have
said
what
i
expected
and
i
thank
you
thank
you
you
and
i
will
do
it
oh
do
fear
now
but
i
shall
i
done
it
no
matter
she
went
on
in
her
exaltation
no
matter
how
much
we
care
for
each
other
now
no
said
sewell
decidedly
that
does
follow
i
have
thought
of
such
things
there
was
such
a
case
within
my
experience
once
he
could
not
help
alleging
this
case
in
which
he
had
long
triumphed
and
i
have
always
felt
that
i
did
right
in
advising
against
a
romantic
notion
of
in
such
matters
you
may
commit
a
greater
wrong
in
that
than
in
an
act
of
apparent
you
have
not
put
the
case
fully
before
me
and
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
but
if
you
contemplate
any
rash
sacrifice
i
warn
you
against
you
said
that
we
ought
to
act
yes
but
you
must
beware
of
the
refined
selfishness
which
shrinks
from
righteous
because
it
is
painful
you
must
make
sure
of
your
real
motive
you
must
consider
whether
your
sacrifice
is
not
going
to
do
more
harm
than
good
but
why
do
you
come
to
me
with
your
trouble
why
do
you
go
to
your
father
your
mother
i
have
ah
she
had
risen
and
pushed
by
him
to
the
outer
door
though
he
tried
to
keep
her
do
be
rash
he
urged
i
advise
you
to
take
time
to
think
of
this
she
did
not
answer
she
seemed
now
only
to
wish
to
escape
as
if
in
terror
of
him
she
pulled
open
the
door
and
was
gone
sewell
went
back
to
his
tea
bewildered
confounded
what
the
matter
why
did
he
come
in
to
tea
with
you
asked
his
wife
who
what
barker
david
what
the
matter
sewell
started
from
his
daze
and
glanced
at
his
children
i
tell
you
by
and
by
xxxiii
a
month
passed
and
sewell
heard
nothing
of
lemuel
his
charge
always
elusive
and
evanescent
had
now
completely
vanished
and
he
could
find
no
trace
of
him
corey
suggested
advertising
bellingham
said
why
not
put
it
in
the
hands
of
a
detective
he
said
he
had
never
helped
work
anything
up
with
a
detective
he
rather
thought
he
should
like
to
do
it
sewell
thought
of
writing
to
barker
mother
at
willoughby
pastures
but
he
postponed
it
perhaps
it
would
alarm
her
if
barker
were
not
there
sewell
had
many
other
cares
and
duties
lemuel
became
more
and
more
a
good
intention
of
the
indefinite
future
after
all
he
had
always
shown
the
ability
to
take
care
of
himself
and
except
that
he
had
mysteriously
disappeared
there
was
no
reason
for
anxiety
about
him
one
night
his
name
came
up
at
a
moment
when
sewell
was
least
prepared
by
interest
or
expectation
to
see
him
he
smiled
to
himself
in
running
downstairs
at
the
reflection
that
he
never
seemed
quite
ready
for
barker
but
it
was
a
relief
to
have
him
turn
up
again
there
was
no
question
of
that
and
sewell
showed
him
a
face
of
welcome
that
dropped
at
sight
of
him
he
scarcely
new
the
gaunt
careworn
face
or
the
shabby
figure
before
him
in
place
of
the
handsome
young
fellow
whom
he
had
come
to
greet
there
seemed
a
sort
of
reversion
in
whole
presence
to
the
time
when
sewell
first
found
him
in
that
room
and
in
whatever
trouble
he
now
was
the
effect
was
that
of
his
original
rustic
constraint
trouble
there
was
of
some
kind
sewell
could
see
at
a
glance
and
his
kind
heart
prompted
him
to
take
lemuel
hand
between
both
of
his
why
my
dear
boy
he
began
but
he
stopped
and
made
lemuel
sit
down
waited
for
him
to
speak
without
further
question
or
comment
mr
sewell
the
young
man
said
abruptly
you
told
me
once
you
that
you
sometimes
had
money
put
into
your
hands
that
you
could
yes
replied
sewell
with
eager
cordiality
could
i
borrow
about
dollars
of
you
why
certainly
barker
sewell
had
not
so
much
of
what
he
called
his
fund
by
him
but
he
instantly
resolved
to
advance
the
difference
out
of
his
own
pocket
it
to
get
me
an
outfit
for
conductor
said
lemuel
i
can
have
the
place
if
i
can
get
the
conductor
reverberated
sewell
what
in
the
world
for
it
work
i
can
do
answered
lemuel
briefly
but
not
resentfully
but
there
are
so
many
other
things
better
fitter
more
profitable
why
did
you
leave
corey
i
assure
you
that
you
have
been
a
great
loss
to
him
in
every
way
you
do
know
how
much
he
valued
you
personally
he
will
be
only
too
glad
to
have
you
come
i
ca
go
back
said
lemuel
i
going
to
get
married
cried
sewell
in
consternation
my
the
lady
that
i
going
to
marry
has
been
sick
ever
since
the
first
of
october
and
i
have
had
a
chance
to
look
up
any
kind
of
work
but
she
better
now
and
i
heard
of
this
place
i
can
get
i
do
like
to
trouble
you
but
everything
gone
i
got
my
mother
down
here
helping
take
care
of
her
and
i
must
do
something
i
know
just
when
i
can
pay
you
back
but
i
do
it
oh
i
sure
of
that
said
sewell
from
the
abyss
of
hopeless
conjecture
into
which
these
facts
had
plunged
him
his
wandering
fancy
was
dominated
by
the
presence
of
lemuel
mother
with
her
bloomers
in
boston
i
i
hope
there
nothing
serious
the
trouble
with
your
the
lady
he
said
rubbing
away
with
his
hand
the
smile
that
came
to
his
lips
in
spite
of
him
it
lung
trouble
said
lemuel
quietly
oh
responded
sewell
well
well
he
shook
himself
together
and
wondered
what
had
become
of
the
impulse
he
had
felt
to
scold
barker
for
the
idea
of
getting
married
but
such
a
course
now
seemed
not
only
far
beyond
his
province
he
heard
himself
saying
that
to
sewell
in
when
she
should
censure
him
for
not
doing
it
but
utterly
useless
in
view
of
the
further
complications
well
this
is
great
news
you
tell
me
a
great
surprise
you
you
going
to
take
an
important
step
you
you
of
course
of
course
you
must
have
a
great
many
demands
upon
you
under
the
circumstances
yes
yes
and
i
very
glad
you
came
to
me
if
your
mind
is
quite
made
up
about
yes
i
thought
it
over
said
lemuel
the
lady
has
had
to
work
all
her
life
and
she
she
is
used
to
what
i
thought
what
i
intended
any
other
kind
of
people
and
it
better
for
us
both
that
i
should
get
some
kind
of
work
that
wo
take
me
away
from
her
too
much
he
dropped
his
head
and
sewell
with
a
flash
of
intelligence
felt
a
thrill
of
compassionate
admiration
for
the
poor
foolish
generous
creature
for
so
lemuel
complexly
appeared
to
him
again
he
forbore
question
or
comment
well
well
we
must
look
you
up
sewell
and
i
we
must
come
to
see
your
the
he
found
himself
falling
helplessly
into
lemuel
way
of
describing
her
just
write
me
your
address
here
he
put
a
scrap
of
paper
before
lemuel
on
the
davenport
and
i
go
and
get
you
the
he
brought
it
back
in
an
envelope
which
held
a
very
little
more
than
lemuel
had
asked
for
sewell
had
not
dared
to
add
much
and
lemuel
put
it
in
his
pocket
he
tried
to
say
something
he
could
only
make
a
husky
noise
in
his
throat
good
night
said
sewell
pressing
his
hand
with
both
of
his
again
at
the
door
we
shall
come
very
married
said
sewell
when
he
returned
to
her
and
then
she
suffered
a
silence
to
ensue
in
which
it
seemed
to
sewell
that
his
inculpation
was
visibly
accumulating
mountains
vast
and
high
did
you
nothing
he
answered
almost
gaily
the
case
was
so
far
beyond
despair
what
should
have
said
xxxiv
lemuel
got
a
conductor
overcoat
and
cap
at
from
a
man
who
had
been
discharged
and
put
by
the
money
saved
to
return
to
sewell
when
he
should
come
he
entered
upon
his
duties
the
next
morning
under
the
instruction
of
an
old
conductor
who
said
hai
i
seen
you
before
and
he
worked
all
day
taking
money
and
tickets
registering
fares
helping
ladies
on
and
off
the
car
and
monotonously
journeying
back
and
forth
over
his
route
he
went
on
duty
at
six
in
the
morning
after
an
early
breakfast
that
grier
and
his
mother
got
him
for
statira
was
not
strong
enough
yet
to
do
much
and
he
was
to
be
relieved
at
eight
at
nightfall
after
two
respites
for
dinner
and
tea
he
was
so
tired
that
he
could
scarcely
stand
well
how
do
you
like
it
as
fur
you
gone
asked
the
instructing
conductor
in
whom
lemuel
had
recognised
an
old
acquaintance
sweet
life
ai
it
there
that
switch
hai
worked
again
jump
off
young
man
and
put
your
shoulder
to
the
wheel
the
car
had
failed
to
take
the
turn
where
the
line
divided
it
had
to
be
pushed
back
and
while
the
driver
tugged
and
swore
under
his
breath
at
his
horses
lemuel
set
himself
to
push
the
car
no
use
said
the
driver
finally
i
got
to
hitch
on
at
the
other
end
and
pull
her
he
uncoupled
the
team
from
the
front
of
the
car
and
swung
round
with
it
lemuel
felt
something
strike
him
on
the
leg
and
he
fell
down
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
again
but
his
left
leg
doubled
under
him
it
went
through
his
mind
that
one
of
the
horses
must
have
lashed
out
and
broken
it
then
everything
seemed
to
stop
the
world
began
again
for
him
in
the
apothecary
shop
where
he
had
been
carried
and
from
which
he
was
put
into
an
ambulance
by
a
policeman
it
stopped
again
as
he
whirled
away
it
renewed
itself
in
anguish
and
ceased
in
bliss
as
he
fainted
from
the
pain
or
came
to
they
lifted
him
up
some
steps
at
last
and
carried
him
into
a
high
bright
room
where
there
were
two
or
three
cots
and
a
long
glass
case
full
of
surgical
instruments
they
laid
him
on
a
cot
and
some
one
swiftly
and
skilfully
undressed
him
a
surgeon
had
come
in
and
now
he
examined
lemuel
leg
he
looked
once
or
twice
at
his
face
this
is
a
pretty
bad
job
i
ca
tell
how
bad
till
you
have
had
the
ether
will
you
leave
it
with
me
yes
but
do
the
best
you
can
for
you
may
be
sure
i
lemuel
believed
that
they
meant
to
cut
off
his
leg
he
knew
that
he
had
a
right
to
refuse
and
to
take
the
consequences
but
he
would
not
he
had
no
right
to
choose
death
when
he
had
others
to
live
for
he
woke
deathly
sick
at
first
and
found
himself
lying
in
bed
one
of
the
two
rows
in
a
long
room
where
there
were
some
quiet
women
in
neat
caps
and
seersucker
dresses
going
about
with
bowls
of
food
and
bottles
of
medicine
lemuel
still
felt
his
leg
and
the
pain
in
it
but
he
had
heard
how
mutilated
men
felt
their
lost
limbs
all
their
lives
and
he
was
afraid
to
make
sure
by
the
touch
of
his
hand
a
nurse
who
saw
his
eyes
open
came
to
him
he
turned
them
upon
her
but
he
could
not
speak
she
must
have
understood
the
doctor
thinks
he
can
save
your
leg
for
you
but
it
a
bad
fracture
you
must
be
careful
to
keep
very
he
fell
asleep
and
life
began
again
for
him
in
the
midst
of
suffering
and
death
he
saw
every
day
broken
and
mangled
men
drunk
with
ether
brought
up
as
he
had
been
and
laid
in
beds
he
saw
the
priest
of
the
religion
to
which
most
of
the
poor
and
lowly
still
belong
go
and
come
among
the
cots
and
stand
by
the
pillows
where
the
sick
feebly
followed
him
in
the
mystical
gestures
which
he
made
on
his
brow
and
breast
he
learned
to
know
the
use
of
the
white
linen
screen
which
was
drawn
about
a
bed
to
hide
the
passing
of
a
soul
he
became
familiar
with
the
helpless
sympathy
the
despair
of
the
friends
who
came
to
visit
the
sick
and
dying
he
had
not
lacked
for
more
attention
and
interest
from
his
own
than
the
rules
of
the
hospital
allowed
his
mother
and
grier
came
first
and
then
statira
when
they
would
let
her
she
thought
it
hard
that
she
was
not
suffered
to
do
the
least
thing
for
him
she
wished
to
take
him
away
to
their
own
rooms
where
she
could
nurse
him
twice
as
well
at
first
she
cried
whenever
she
saw
him
and
lamented
over
him
so
that
the
head
nurse
was
obliged
to
explain
to
her
that
she
disturbed
the
patients
and
could
not
come
any
more
unless
she
controlled
herself
she
promised
and
kept
her
word
she
sat
quietly
by
his
pillow
and
held
his
hand
when
she
came
except
when
she
put
up
her
own
to
hide
the
cough
which
she
could
not
always
restrain
the
nurse
told
her
that
of
course
she
was
not
accountable
for
the
cough
but
she
had
better
try
to
check
it
statira
brought
troches
with
her
and
held
them
in
her
mouth
for
this
purpose
lemuel
family
was
taken
care
of
in
this
time
of
disaster
the
newspapers
had
made
his
accident
promptly
known
and
not
only
sewell
but
miss
vane
and
corey
had
come
to
see
if
they
could
be
of
any
use
one
day
a
young
girl
brought
a
bouquet
of
flowers
and
set
it
by
bed
when
he
seemed
asleep
he
suddenly
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
sybil
vane
for
the
first
time
since
their
quarrel
she
put
her
finger
to
her
lip
and
smiled
with
the
air
of
a
lady
benefactress
then
with
a
few
words
of
official
sympathy
she
encouraged
him
to
get
well
and
flitted
to
the
next
bed
where
she
bestowed
a
jacqueminot
rosebud
on
a
chinaman
dying
of
cancer
sewell
came
often
to
see
him
at
first
in
the
teeth
of
his
obvious
hostility
but
with
her
greater
and
greater
relenting
nothing
seemed
gloomier
than
the
outlook
for
lemuel
but
sewell
had
lived
too
long
not
to
know
that
the
gloom
of
an
outlook
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
man
real
future
it
was
impossible
of
course
for
lemuel
to
go
back
to
corey
now
with
a
sick
wife
who
would
need
so
much
of
his
care
besides
he
did
not
think
it
desirable
on
other
accounts
he
recurred
to
what
lemuel
had
said
about
getting
work
that
should
not
take
him
too
far
away
from
the
kind
of
people
his
betrothed
was
used
to
and
he
felt
a
pity
and
respect
for
the
boy
whom
life
had
already
taught
this
wisdom
this
resignation
he
could
see
that
before
his
last
calamity
had
come
upon
him
barker
was
trying
to
adjust
his
ambition
to
his
next
duty
or
rather
to
subordinate
it
and
the
conviction
that
he
was
right
gave
sewell
courage
to
think
that
he
would
yet
somehow
succeed
it
also
gave
him
courage
to
resist
on
barker
behalf
the
generous
importunities
of
some
who
would
have
befriended
him
corey
and
charles
bellingham
drove
up
to
the
hospital
one
day
to
see
lemuel
and
when
sewell
met
them
the
same
evening
they
were
full
of
enthusiasm
corey
said
that
the
effect
of
the
hospital
with
its
wards
branching
from
the
classistic
building
in
the
centre
was
delightfully
italian
it
was
like
peter
on
a
small
scale
and
he
had
no
idea
how
interesting
the
south
end
was
it
was
quite
a
bit
of
foreign
travel
to
go
up
there
bellingham
had
explored
the
hospital
throughout
he
said
he
had
found
it
the
thing
to
do
it
was
a
thing
for
everybody
to
do
he
was
astonished
that
he
had
never
done
it
before
they
united
in
praising
barker
and
they
asked
what
could
be
done
for
him
corey
was
strenuous
for
his
coming
back
to
him
at
any
rate
they
must
find
something
for
him
bellingham
favoured
the
notion
of
doing
something
for
his
education
a
fellow
like
that
could
come
to
almost
anything
sewell
shook
his
head
all
that
impossible
now
with
that
girl
oh
confound
her
cried
bellingham
i
was
rather
disappointed
at
not
seeing
his
mother
said
corey
i
had
counted
a
good
deal
i
find
upon
barker
with
a
girl
like
that
for
his
wife
pursued
sewell
the
conditions
are
all
changed
he
must
cleave
to
her
in
mind
as
well
as
body
and
he
must
seek
the
kind
of
life
that
will
unite
them
more
and
more
not
less
and
less
in
fact
he
was
instinctively
doing
so
when
this
accident
happened
that
what
marriage
oh
not
always
suggested
corey
he
must
go
back
to
willoughby
pastures
sewell
concluded
to
his
oh
come
now
said
bellingham
with
disgust
if
that
sort
of
thing
is
to
go
on
said
corey
what
is
to
become
of
the
ancestry
of
the
future
of
boston
i
counted
upon
barker
to
found
one
of
our
first
families
besides
any
irishman
could
take
his
farm
and
do
better
with
it
the
farm
would
be
meat
to
the
irishman
and
poison
to
barker
now
that
he
once
tasted
yes
i
know
all
that
said
sewell
sadly
i
once
thought
the
greatest
possible
good
i
could
do
barker
after
getting
him
to
boston
was
to
get
him
back
to
willoughby
pastures
but
if
that
was
ever
true
the
time
is
past
now
it
merely
seems
the
only
thing
possible
when
he
gets
well
he
will
still
have
an
invalid
wife
on
his
hands
he
must
provide
her
a
home
she
could
have
helped
him
once
and
would
have
done
so
i
no
doubt
but
now
she
must
be
taken
care
look
here
said
bellingham
what
the
reason
these
things
ca
be
managed
as
they
are
in
the
novels
in
any
romance
that
cough
of
hers
would
run
into
quick
consumption
and
carry
fiancee
off
in
six
weeks
and
then
he
could
resume
his
career
of
usefulness
and
prosperity
here
do
you
know
he
could
marry
some
one
else
and
found
that
family
that
corey
they
all
laughed
sewell
ruefully
as
it
is
said
corey
i
suppose
she
go
on
having
hemorrhages
to
a
good
old
age
and
outlive
him
after
being
a
clog
and
burden
to
him
all
his
life
poor
devil
what
in
the
world
possesses
him
to
want
to
marry
her
but
i
suppose
the
usual
this
gave
sewell
greater
discomfort
than
the
question
of
material
future
he
said
listlessly
oh
i
suppose
so
but
he
was
far
from
thinking
precisely
that
he
had
seen
lemuel
and
the
young
girl
together
a
great
deal
and
a
painful
misgiving
had
grown
up
in
his
mind
it
seemed
to
him
that
while
he
had
seen
no
want
of
patience
and
kindness
towards
her
in
lemuel
he
had
not
seen
the
return
of
her
fondness
which
silly
as
it
was
in
some
of
its
manifestations
he
thought
he
should
be
glad
of
in
him
yet
he
was
not
sure
barker
was
always
so
that
he
might
very
well
feel
more
love
for
her
than
he
showed
and
after
all
sewell
rather
weakly
asked
himself
was
the
love
so
absolutely
necessary
when
he
repeated
this
question
in
his
wife
presence
she
told
him
she
was
astonished
at
him
you
know
that
it
is
necessary
it
all
the
more
necessary
if
he
so
superior
to
her
as
you
say
i
ca
think
what
become
of
your
principles
my
dear
i
do
you
got
them
said
sewell
i
really
believe
i
have
said
his
wife
with
that
full
conviction
of
righteousness
which
her
sex
alone
can
feel
i
have
always
heard
you
say
that
marriage
without
love
was
not
only
sinful
in
itself
but
the
beginning
of
sorrow
why
do
you
think
now
that
it
makes
no
difference
i
suppose
i
was
trying
to
adapt
myself
to
circumstances
answered
sewell
frankly
at
least
let
hope
that
my
facts
are
as
wrong
as
my
conclusions
i
not
sure
of
either
i
suppose
if
i
saw
him
idolising
so
slight
and
light
a
person
as
she
seems
to
be
i
should
be
more
disheartened
about
his
future
than
i
am
now
if
he
overvalued
her
it
would
only
drag
him
lower
oh
his
future
drag
him
down
why
do
you
think
of
her
going
up
there
to
that
dismal
wilderness
to
spend
her
days
in
toil
and
poverty
with
a
and
a
rheumatic
in
such
a
looking
hovel
sewell
did
not
group
these
disadvantages
conventionally
but
they
were
effective
you
have
allowed
your
feelings
about
that
baffling
creature
to
blind
you
to
everything
else
david
why
should
you
care
so
much
for
his
future
and
nothing
for
hers
is
that
so
very
bright
i
do
think
that
either
is
dazzling
sighed
the
minister
yet
barker
grew
a
little
lighter
as
he
familiarised
himself
with
it
or
rather
with
barker
he
found
that
he
had
a
plan
for
getting
a
place
in
the
academy
if
they
reopened
it
at
willoughby
pastures
as
they
talked
of
doing
under
the
impulse
of
such
a
course
in
one
of
the
neighbouring
towns
and
that
he
was
going
home
in
fancy
at
least
with
purposes
of
enlightenment
and
elevation
which
would
go
far
to
console
him
under
such
measure
of
disappointment
as
they
must
bring
sewell
hinted
to
barker
that
he
must
not
be
too
confident
of
remodelling
willoughby
pastures
upon
the
pattern
of
boston
oh
no
i
do
expect
that
said
lemuel
what
i
mean
is
that
i
shall
always
try
to
remember
myself
what
i
learnt
here
from
the
kind
of
men
i
seen
and
the
things
that
i
know
people
are
all
the
time
doing
for
others
i
told
you
once
that
they
have
got
any
idea
of
that
in
the
country
i
do
expect
to
preach
it
into
them
they
would
like
it
if
i
did
and
they
make
fun
of
it
but
if
i
could
try
to
it
yes
said
sewell
touched
by
this
young
enthusiasm
i
do
know
as
i
can
all
the
time
said
lemuel
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
what
i
learnt
here
if
i
learnt
anything
i
think
the
world
a
good
deal
better
than
i
used
do
you
indeed
my
dear
boy
asked
sewell
greatly
interested
it
a
pretty
world
i
hope
it
yes
that
what
i
mean
said
lemuel
i
presume
it
perfect
is
i
should
say
and
sewell
smiled
mr
corey
was
always
correcting
me
on
that
but
if
i
were
to
do
nothing
but
pass
along
the
good
that
been
done
me
since
i
came
here
i
should
be
kept
busy
the
rest
of
my
sewell
knew
that
this
emotion
was
largely
the
physical
optimism
of
convalescence
but
he
could
not
refuse
the
comfort
it
gave
him
to
find
barker
in
such
a
mood
and
he
did
not
conceive
it
his
duty
to
discourage
it
lofty
ideals
if
not
indulged
at
the
expense
of
lowly
realities
he
had
never
found
hurtful
to
any
and
it
was
certainly
better
for
barker
to
think
too
well
than
too
ill
of
boston
if
it
furnished
him
incentives
to
unselfish
living
he
could
think
of
enough
things
in
the
city
to
warrant
a
different
judgment
but
if
barker
lesson
from
his
experience
there
was
this
sewell
was
not
the
person
to
weaken
its
force
with
him
he
said
with
a
smile
of
reserved
comment
well
perhaps
you
be
coming
back
to
us
some
i
do
look
forward
to
that
said
lemuel
soberly
and
then
his
face
took
a
sterner
cast
as
if
from
the
force
of
his
resolution
the
first
thing
i
got
to
do
after
i
made
a
home
for
her
is
to
get
statira
away
from
the
town
where
she
can
have
some
better
air
and
see
if
she
ca
get
her
health
back
it
be
time
enough
to
talk
of
boston
again
when
she
fit
to
live
the
minister
sympathetic
spirit
sank
again
but
his
final
parting
with
barker
was
not
unhopeful
lemuel
consented
to
accept
from
him
a
small
loan
to
the
compass
of
which
he
reduced
the
eager
bounty
of
miss
vane
and
corey
representing
that
more
would
be
a
burden
and
an
offence
to
barker
statira
and
his
mother
came
with
him
to
take
leave
of
the
sewells
they
dismounted
from
the
at
the
minister
door
and
he
saw
with
sensibility
the
two
women
helping
lemuel
off
he
walked
with
a
cane
and
they
went
carefully
on
either
side
of
him
sewell
hastened
to
meet
them
at
the
door
himself
and
he
was
so
much
interested
in
the
spectacle
of
this
mutual
affection
that
he
failed
at
first
to
observe
that
barker
wore
the
skirts
of
occidental
civilisation
instead
of
the
bloomers
which
he
had
identified
her
with
she
she
goin
to
put
on
again
as
soon
as
she
gets
back
to
willoughby
the
younger
woman
explained
to
sewell
in
an
aside
while
the
minister
was
engaged
with
lemuel
and
his
mother
but
i
tell
her
as
long
as
it
ai
the
fashion
in
boston
i
guess
she
better
statira
had
got
on
her
genteel
prolongation
of
her
last
syllables
again
i
guess
i
shall
get
along
with
her
she
kind
of
queer
when
you
first
get
acquainted
but
she
she
was
herself
very
prettily
dressed
and
though
she
looked
thin
and
at
times
gave
a
deep
dismal
cough
she
was
so
bright
and
gay
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
hopeful
about
her
she
became
very
confidential
with
sewell
whom
she
apparently
brevetted
lemuel
best
friend
and
obliged
to
a
greater
show
of
interest
in
him
than
she
had
ever
felt
she
told
her
the
whole
history
of
her
love
affair
and
of
how
much
grier
had
done
to
help
it
on
at
first
and
then
how
she
had
wanted
her
to
break
off
with
lemuel
but
she
concluded
i
think
we
goin
to
get
along
real
nice
together
i
know
as
we
shall
live
all
in
the
same
i
guess
it
be
the
best
thing
for
lem
and
i
if
we
can
board
till
we
get
some
little
of
our
health
back
i
more
scared
for
him
than
what
i
am
for
i
do
presume
but
what
we
shall
both
miss
the
city
some
but
he
might
be
out
of
a
job
all
winter
in
town
i
should
want
he
should
go
back
on
them
most
i
hate
is
leavin
grier
she
is
the
one
that
i
roomed
with
ever
since
i
first
came
to
boston
but
lem
and
her
do
get
on
very
well
they
hai
really
either
of
anything
against
each
other
now
but
they
do
very
and
of
course
i
got
to
have
the
friends
that
he
wants
me
to
have
and
what
grier
says
and
so
it
just
as
well
we
to
be
where
they
wo
she
talked
to
sewell
in
a
low
voice
but
she
kept
her
eyes
upon
lemuel
all
the
time
and
when
sewell
took
him
and
his
mother
the
length
of
the
front
away
she
was
quite
distraught
and
answered
at
random
till
he
came
back
sewell
did
not
know
what
to
think
would
this
dependence
warm
her
betrothed
to
greater
tenderness
than
he
now
showed
or
would
its
excess
disgust
him
he
was
not
afraid
that
lemuel
would
ever
be
unkind
to
her
but
he
knew
that
in
marriage
kindness
was
not
enough
he
looked
at
lemuel
serious
thoughtful
refined
in
his
beauty
by
suffering
and
then
his
eye
wandered
to
statira
delicate
prettiness
so
sweet
so
full
of
amiable
cheerfulness
so
undeniably
light
and
silly
what
chiefly
comforted
him
was
the
fact
of
an
ally
whom
the
young
thing
had
apparently
found
in
lemuel
mother
whether
that
grim
ignorant
pride
in
her
son
had
been
satisfied
with
a
girl
of
style
and
fashion
and
proven
capableness
in
housekeeping
or
whether
some
fancy
for
butterfly
prettiness
lurking
in
the
fastnesses
of
the
old
woman
rugged
nature
had
been
snared
by
the
gay
face
and
dancing
eyes
it
was
apparent
that
she
at
least
was
in
love
with
statira
she
allowed
herself
to
be
poked
about
and
rearranged
as
to
her
shawl
and
the
youthful
hat
which
she
wore
on
the
peak
of
her
skull
and
she
softened
to
something
like
a
smile
at
the
touch
of
statira
quick
hands
they
had
all
come
rather
early
to
make
their
parting
visit
at
the
sewells
for
the
barkers
were
going
to
take
the
two
train
for
willoughby
pastures
while
statira
was
to
remain
in
boston
till
he
could
make
a
home
for
her
lemuel
promised
to
write
as
soon
as
he
should
be
settled
and
tell
sewell
about
his
life
and
his
work
and
sewell
beyond
earshot
of
his
wife
told
him
he
might
certainly
count
upon
seeing
them
at
willoughby
in
the
course
of
the
next
summer
they
all
shook
hands
several
times
lemuel
mother
gave
her
hand
from
under
the
fringe
of
her
shawl
standing
bolt
upright
at
off
and
sewell
said
it
felt
like
a
collection
of
xxxv
well
said
sewell
wife
when
they
were
gone
well
he
responded
and
after
a
moment
he
said
there
this
comfort
about
it
which
we
do
always
have
in
such
cases
there
does
seem
to
be
anybody
else
it
would
be
indefinitely
worse
if
there
why
of
course
what
in
the
world
are
you
thinking
about
about
that
foolish
girl
who
came
to
me
with
her
miserable
i
declare
i
ca
get
rid
of
it
i
feel
morally
certain
that
she
went
away
from
me
and
dismissed
the
poor
fellow
who
was
looking
to
her
love
to
save
at
the
cost
of
some
other
poor
creature
who
trusted
and
believed
in
him
till
his
silly
fancy
changed
i
hope
for
the
credit
of
women
that
she
did
but
you
may
be
morally
certain
she
did
nothing
of
the
kind
girls
do
give
up
all
their
hopes
in
life
so
easily
as
that
she
might
think
she
would
do
it
because
she
had
read
of
such
things
and
thought
it
was
fine
but
when
it
came
to
the
pinch
she
i
hope
not
if
she
did
she
would
commit
a
great
error
a
criminal
well
you
need
be
afraid
look
at
tom
corey
and
that
was
her
own
sister
that
was
different
corey
had
never
thought
of
her
sister
much
less
made
love
to
her
or
promised
to
marry
her
besides
corey
had
her
father
and
mother
to
advise
her
and
support
her
in
behaving
sensibly
and
this
poor
creature
had
nothing
but
her
own
novel
fed
fancies
and
her
crazy
conscience
she
thought
that
because
she
inflicted
suffering
upon
herself
she
was
acting
unselfishly
really
the
fakirs
of
india
and
the
penitentes
of
new
mexico
are
more
harmless
for
they
do
hurt
any
one
else
if
she
has
forced
some
poor
fellow
into
a
marriage
like
this
of
barker
she
committed
a
deadly
sin
she
better
driven
him
to
suicide
than
condemned
him
to
live
a
lie
to
the
end
of
his
days
no
doubt
she
regarded
it
as
a
momentary
act
of
expiation
that
the
way
her
romances
taught
her
to
look
at
loveless
marriage
as
something
spectacular
transitory
instead
of
the
enduring
degrading
squalor
that
it
is
what
in
the
world
are
you
talking
about
david
i
should
think
were
a
novelist
yourself
by
the
wild
way
you
go
on
you
have
no
proof
whatever
that
barker
is
happily
engaged
i
sure
he
got
a
much
better
girl
than
he
deserves
and
one
that
fully
his
equal
she
only
too
fond
of
that
dry
stick
such
a
girl
as
the
one
you
described
like
that
mysterious
visitor
of
yours
what
possible
relation
could
she
have
with
him
she
was
a
lady
yes
yes
of
course
it
absurd
but
everybody
seems
to
be
tangled
up
with
everybody
else
my
dear
will
you
give
me
a
cup
of
tea
i
think
i
go
to
writing
at
before
she
left
her
husband
to
order
his
tea
sewell
asked
and
do
you
think
you
have
got
through
with
him
now
i
have
just
begun
with
him
replied
sewell
his
mind
naturally
enough
in
connection
with
lemuel
was
running
upon
his
friend
evans
and
the
subject
they
had
once
talked
of
in
that
room
it
was
primarily
in
thinking
of
him
that
he
begun
to
write
his
sermon
on
complicity
which
made
a
great
impression
at
the
time
and
had
a
more
lasting
effect
as
enlarged
from
the
newspaper
reports
and
reprinted
in
pamphlet
form
his
evolution
from
the
text
remember
them
that
are
in
bonds
as
bound
with
them
of
a
complete
philosophy
of
life
was
humorously
treated
by
some
of
his
critics
as
a
phase
of
darwinism
but
upon
the
whole
the
sermon
met
with
great
favour
it
not
only
strengthened
sewell
hold
upon
the
affections
of
his
own
congregation
but
carried
his
name
beyond
boston
and
made
him
the
topic
of
editorials
in
the
sunday
editions
of
leading
newspapers
as
far
off
as
chicago
it
struck
one
of
those
popular
moods
of
intelligent
sympathy
when
the
failure
of
a
large
class
of
underpaid
and
worthy
workers
to
assert
their
right
to
a
living
wage
against
a
powerful
monopoly
had
sent
a
thrill
of
respectful
pity
through
every
generous
heart
in
the
country
and
it
was
largely
supposed
that
sewell
sermon
referred
indirectly
to
the
telegraphers
strike
those
who
were
aware
of
his
habit
of
seeking
to
produce
a
personal
rather
than
a
general
effect
of
his
belief
that
you
can
have
a
righteous
public
only
by
the
slow
process
of
having
righteous
men
and
women
knew
that
he
meant
something
much
nearer
home
to
each
of
his
hearers
when
he
preached
the
old
to
them
and
enforced
again
the
lessons
that
no
one
for
good
or
for
evil
for
sorrow
or
joy
for
sickness
or
health
stood
apart
from
his
fellows
but
each
was
bound
to
the
highest
and
the
lowest
by
ties
that
centred
in
the
hand
of
god
no
man
he
said
sinned
or
suffered
to
himself
alone
his
error
and
his
pain
darkened
and
afflicted
men
who
never
heard
of
his
name
if
a
community
was
corrupt
if
an
age
was
immoral
it
was
not
because
of
the
vicious
but
the
virtuous
who
fancied
themselves
indifferent
spectators
it
was
not
the
tyrant
who
oppressed
it
was
the
wickedness
that
had
made
him
possible
the
gospel
christ
god
so
far
as
men
had
imagined
him
was
but
a
lesson
a
type
a
witness
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
of
the
spiritual
unity
of
man
as
we
grew
in
grace
in
humanity
in
civilisation
our
recognition
of
this
truth
would
be
transfigured
from
a
duty
to
a
privilege
a
joy
a
heavenly
rapture
many
men
might
go
through
life
harmlessly
without
realising
this
perhaps
but
sterilely
only
those
who
had
had
the
care
of
others
laid
upon
them
lived
usefully
fruitfully
let
no
one
shrink
from
such
a
burden
or
seek
to
rid
himself
of
it
rather
let
him
bind
it
fast
upon
his
neck
and
rejoice
in
it
the
wretched
the
foolish
the
ignorant
whom
we
found
at
every
turn
were
something
more
they
were
the
messengers
of
god
sent
to
tell
his
secret
to
any
that
would
hear
it
happy
he
in
whose
ears
their
cry
for
help
was
a
perpetual
voice
for
that
man
whatever
his
creed
knew
god
and
could
never
forget
him
in
his
responsibility
for
his
weaker
brethren
he
was
godlike
for
god
was
but
the
impersonation
of
loving
responsibility
of
infinite
and
care
for
us
all
when
sewell
came
down
from
his
pulpit
many
people
came
up
to
speak
to
him
of
his
sermon
some
of
the
women
faces
showed
the
traces
of
tears
and
each
person
had
made
its
application
to
himself
there
were
two
or
three
who
had
heard
between
the
words
old
bromfield
corey
who
was
coming
a
good
deal
more
to
church
since
his
eyes
began
to
fail
him
because
it
was
a
change
and
a
sort
of
relief
from
being
read
to
said
i
did
know
that
they
had
translated
it
barker
in
the
revised
version
well
you
must
let
me
know
how
he
getting
on
sewell
and
give
me
a
chance
at
the
revelation
too
if
he
ever
gets
troublesome
to
you
miss
vane
was
standing
at
the
door
with
his
wife
when
sewell
came
out
she
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
do
you
think
i
threw
away
my
chance
she
demanded
she
had
her
veil
down
and
at
first
sewell
thought
it
was
laughter
that
shook
her
voice
but
it
was
not
that
he
did
not
know
quite
what
to
say
but
he
did
say
he
was
sent
to
as
they
walked
off
alone
his
wife
said
well
david
i
hope
you
have
preached
away
all
your
truth
and
i
know
what
you
mean
my
dear
answered
sewell
humbly
he
added
you
shall
remind
me
if
i
seem
likely
to
but
he
concluded
seriously
if
i
thought
i
could
never
do
anything
more
for
barker
i
should
be
very
unhappy
i
should
take
it
as
a
sign
that
i
had
been
recreant
to
my
xxxvi
the
minister
heard
directly
from
barker
two
or
three
times
during
the
winter
and
as
often
through
statira
who
came
to
see
sewell
barker
had
not
got
the
place
he
had
hoped
for
at
once
but
he
had
got
a
school
in
the
country
a
little
way
off
and
he
was
doing
something
and
he
expected
to
do
better
the
winter
proved
a
very
severe
one
i
guess
it
just
as
well
i
stayed
in
town
said
statira
the
last
time
she
came
with
a
resignation
which
sewell
fond
of
the
ideal
in
others
as
most
ladies
are
did
not
like
grier
says
killed
me
up
there
and
i
d
know
but
what
it
would
i
done
so
well
here
since
the
cold
weather
set
in
that
grier
she
thinks
i
had
better
get
married
right
away
well
not
till
it
comes
summer
anyway
i
tell
her
i
guess
she
do
want
i
should
get
married
at
all
after
all
she
done
to
help
it
along
first
off
her
and
barker
do
seem
to
get
along
very
now
that
statira
felt
a
little
better
acquainted
with
sewell
she
dropped
the
genteel
elongation
of
her
final
syllables
and
used
such
vernacular
forms
of
speech
as
came
first
to
her
the
name
of
grier
seemed
to
come
in
at
every
fourth
word
with
her
and
she
tired
sewell
with
visits
which
she
appeared
unable
to
bring
to
a
close
of
herself
a
long
relief
from
them
ended
in
an
alarm
for
her
health
with
sewell
who
went
to
find
her
she
found
her
still
better
than
before
and
statira
frankly
accounted
for
her
absence
by
saying
that
thought
she
had
better
not
come
any
more
till
sewell
returned
some
of
her
calls
she
laughed
and
then
she
said
i
do
know
as
you
found
me
here
if
you
come
much
later
grier
do
want
i
should
be
here
in
the
east
winds
now
it
coming
spring
so
soon
and
she
heard
of
a
chance
at
a
box
factory
in
philadelphia
she
wants
i
should
go
there
with
her
and
i
do
know
but
what
it
be
about
the
best
sewell
could
not
deny
the
good
sense
of
the
plan
though
she
was
sensible
of
liking
statira
less
and
less
for
it
the
girl
continued
lem
barker
i
say
wants
i
should
come
up
out
the
east
winds
but
grier
she
opposed
to
it
she
thinks
i
ought
to
have
more
of
a
mild
climate
and
he
better
come
down
there
and
get
a
school
if
he
wants
me
too
statira
broke
into
an
impartial
little
titter
i
sure
i
do
know
which
of
win
the
day
sewell
report
of
this
speech
brought
a
radiant
smile
of
relief
to
sewell
face
ah
well
then
that
settles
it
i
feel
perfectly
sure
that
grier
will
win
the
day
that
poor
sick
flimsy
little
statira
is
completely
under
grier
thumb
and
will
do
just
what
she
says
now
that
there
no
direct
appeal
from
her
will
to
barker
they
will
never
be
married
do
you
see
that
it
was
romance
in
the
beginning
and
that
when
she
came
to
distrust
to
dislike
barker
she
came
to
dislike
her
romance
too
to
hate
it
well
do
romance
him
david
said
sewell
only
conditionally
accepting
his
theory
yet
it
may
be
offered
to
the
reader
as
founded
in
probability
and
human
nature
in
fact
he
may
be
assured
here
that
the
marriage
which
eventually
took
place
was
not
that
of
lemuel
with
statira
though
how
the
union
which
was
not
only
happiness
for
those
it
joined
but
whatever
is
worthier
and
better
in
life
than
happiness
came
about
it
is
aside
from
the
purpose
of
this
story
to
tell
and
must
be
left
for
some
future
inquiry
the
end
