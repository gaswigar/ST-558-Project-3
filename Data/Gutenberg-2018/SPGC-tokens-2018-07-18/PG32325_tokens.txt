a

are
used
to
wit
the

the

form

the

the

the

have
not

by

painstakingly
and
with
the
trustworthy
guidance
and
support
of
personal
familiarity
with
these
several
forms
of
speech
i
make
this
explanation
for
the
reason
that
without
it
many
readers
would
suppose
that
all
these
characters
were
trying
to
talk
alike
and
not

the

huckleberry
finn
chapter
i
you
do
know
about
me
without
you
have
read
a
book
by
the
name
of
adventures
of
tom
sawyer
but
that
ai
no
matter
that
book
was
made
by
mark
twain
and
he
told
the
truth
mainly
there
was
things
which
he
stretched
but
mainly
he
told
the
truth
that
is
nothing
i
never
seen
anybody
but
lied
one
time
or
another
without
it
was
aunt
polly
or
the
widow
or
maybe
mary
aunt
polly
tom
aunt
polly
she
is
and
mary
and
the
widow
douglas
is
all
told
about
in
that
book
which
is
mostly
a
true
book
with
some
stretchers
as
i
said
before
now
the
way
that
the
book
winds
up
is
this
tom
and
me
found
the
money
that
the
robbers
hid
in
the
cave
and
it
made
us
rich
we
got
six
thousand
dollars
apiece
all
gold
it
was
an
awful
sight
of
money
when
it
was
piled
up
well
judge
thatcher
he
took
it
and
put
it
out
at
interest
and
it
fetched
us
a
dollar
a
day
apiece
all
the
year
round
more
than
a
body
could
tell
what
to
do
with
the
widow
douglas
she
took
me
for
her
son
and
allowed
she
would
sivilize
me
but
it
was
rough
living
in
the
house
all
the
time
considering
how
dismal
regular
and
decent
the
widow
was
in
all
her
ways
and
so
when
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
i
lit
out
i
got
into
my
old
rags
and
my
again
and
was
free
and
satisfied
but
tom
sawyer
he
hunted
me
up
and
said
he
was
going
to
start
a
band
of
robbers
and
i
might
join
if
i
would
go
back
to
the
widow
and
be
respectable
so
i
went
back
the
widow
she
cried
over
me
and
called
me
a
poor
lost
lamb
and
she
called
me
a
lot
of
other
names
too
but
she
never
meant
no
harm
by
it
she
put
me
in
them
new
clothes
again
and
i
could
do
nothing
but
sweat
and
sweat
and
feel
all
cramped
up
well
then
the
old
thing
commenced
again
the
widow
rung
a
bell
for
supper
and
you
had
to
come
to
time
when
you
got
to
the
table
you
could
go
right
to
eating
but
you
had
to
wait
for
the
widow
to
tuck
down
her
head
and
grumble
a
little
over
the
victuals
though
there
war
really
anything
the
matter
with
them
that
is
nothing
only
everything
was
cooked
by
itself
in
a
barrel
of
odds
and
ends
it
is
different
things
get
mixed
up
and
the
juice
kind
of
swaps
around
and
the
things
go
better
after
supper
she
got
out
her
book
and
learned
me
about
moses
and
the
bulrushers
and
i
was
in
a
sweat
to
find
out
all
about
him
but
by
and
by
she
let
it
out
that
moses
had
been
dead
a
considerable
long
time
so
then
i
did
care
no
more
about
him
because
i
do
take
no
stock
in
dead
people
pretty
soon
i
wanted
to
smoke
and
asked
the
widow
to
let
me
but
she
would
she
said
it
was
a
mean
practice
and
was
clean
and
i
must
try
to
not
do
it
any
more
that
is
just
the
way
with
some
people
they
get
down
on
a
thing
when
they
do
know
nothing
about
it
here
she
was
about
moses
which
was
no
kin
to
her
and
no
use
to
anybody
being
gone
you
see
yet
finding
a
power
of
fault
with
me
for
doing
a
thing
that
had
some
good
in
it
and
she
took
snuff
too
of
course
that
was
all
right
because
she
done
it
herself
her
sister
miss
watson
a
tolerable
slim
old
maid
with
goggles
on
had
just
come
to
live
with
her
and
took
a
set
at
me
now
with
a
she
worked
me
middling
hard
for
about
an
hour
and
then
the
widow
made
her
ease
up
i
could
stood
it
much
longer
then
for
an
hour
it
was
deadly
dull
and
i
was
fidgety
miss
watson
would
say
do
put
your
feet
up
there
huckleberry
and
do
scrunch
up
like
that
huckleberry
set
up
straight
and
pretty
soon
she
would
say
do
gap
and
stretch
like
that
huckleberry
why
do
you
try
to
behave
then
she
told
me
all
about
the
bad
place
and
i
said
i
wished
i
was
there
she
got
mad
then
but
i
did
mean
no
harm
all
i
wanted
was
to
go
somewheres
all
i
wanted
was
a
change
i
particular
she
said
it
was
wicked
to
say
what
i
said
said
she
would
say
it
for
the
whole
world
she
was
going
to
live
so
as
to
go
to
the
good
place
well
i
could
see
no
advantage
in
going
where
she
was
going
so
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
try
for
it
but
i
never
said
so
because
it
would
only
make
trouble
and
would
do
no
good
now
she
had
got
a
start
and
she
went
on
and
told
me
all
about
the
good
place
she
said
all
a
body
would
have
to
do
there
was
to
go
around
all
day
long
with
a
harp
and
sing
forever
and
ever
so
i
did
think
much
of
it
but
i
never
said
so
i
asked
her
if
she
reckoned
tom
sawyer
would
go
there
and
she
said
not
by
a
considerable
sight
i
was
glad
about
that
because
i
wanted
him
and
me
to
be
together
miss
watson
she
kept
pecking
at
me
and
it
got
tiresome
and
lonesome
by
and
by
they
fetched
the
niggers
in
and
had
prayers
and
then
everybody
was
off
to
bed
i
went
up
to
my
room
with
a
piece
of
candle
and
put
it
on
the
table
then
i
set
down
in
a
chair
by
the
window
and
tried
to
think
of
something
cheerful
but
it
war
no
use
i
felt
so
lonesome
i
most
wished
i
was
dead
the
stars
were
shining
and
the
leaves
rustled
in
the
woods
ever
so
mournful
and
i
heard
an
owl
away
off
about
somebody
that
was
dead
and
a
whippowill
and
a
dog
crying
about
somebody
that
was
going
to
die
and
the
wind
was
trying
to
whisper
something
to
me
and
i
could
make
out
what
it
was
and
so
it
made
the
cold
shivers
run
over
me
then
away
out
in
the
woods
i
heard
that
kind
of
a
sound
that
a
ghost
makes
when
it
wants
to
tell
about
something
that
on
its
mind
and
ca
make
itself
understood
and
so
ca
rest
easy
in
its
grave
and
has
to
go
about
that
way
every
night
grieving
i
got
so
downhearted
and
scared
i
did
wish
i
had
some
company
pretty
soon
a
spider
went
crawling
up
my
shoulder
and
i
flipped
it
off
and
it
lit
in
the
candle
and
before
i
could
budge
it
was
all
shriveled
up
i
did
need
anybody
to
tell
me
that
that
was
an
awful
bad
sign
and
would
fetch
me
some
bad
luck
so
i
was
scared
and
most
shook
the
clothes
off
of
me
i
got
up
and
turned
around
in
my
tracks
three
times
and
crossed
my
breast
every
time
and
then
i
tied
up
a
little
lock
of
my
hair
with
a
thread
to
keep
witches
away
but
i
had
no
confidence
you
do
that
when
you
lost
a
horseshoe
that
you
found
instead
of
nailing
it
up
over
the
door
but
i
had
ever
heard
anybody
say
it
was
any
way
to
keep
off
bad
luck
when
you
killed
a
spider
i
set
down
again
all
over
and
got
out
my
pipe
for
a
smoke
for
the
house
was
all
as
still
as
death
now
and
so
the
widow
know
well
after
a
long
time
i
heard
the
clock
away
off
in
the
town
go
boom
boom
boom
twelve
licks
and
all
still
again
stiller
than
ever
pretty
soon
i
heard
a
twig
snap
down
in
the
dark
amongst
the
trees
something
was
i
set
still
and
listened
directly
i
could
just
barely
hear
a
down
there
that
was
good
says
i
as
soft
as
i
could
and
then
i
put
out
the
light
and
scrambled
out
of
the
window
on
to
the
shed
then
i
slipped
down
to
the
ground
and
crawled
in
among
the
trees
and
sure
enough
there
was
tom
sawyer
waiting
for
me
chapter
ii
we
went
tiptoeing
along
a
path
amongst
the
trees
back
toward
the
end
of
the
widow
garden
stooping
down
so
as
the
branches
scrape
our
heads
when
we
was
passing
by
the
kitchen
i
fell
over
a
root
and
made
a
noise
we
scrouched
down
and
laid
still
miss
big
nigger
named
jim
was
setting
in
the
kitchen
door
we
could
see
him
pretty
clear
because
there
was
a
light
behind
him
he
got
up
and
stretched
his
neck
out
about
a
minute
listening
then
he
says
who
dah
he
listened
some
more
then
he
came
tiptoeing
down
and
stood
right
between
us
we
could
touched
him
nearly
well
likely
it
was
minutes
and
minutes
that
there
war
a
sound
and
we
all
there
so
close
together
there
was
a
place
on
my
ankle
that
got
to
itching
but
i
das
scratch
it
and
then
my
ear
begun
to
itch
and
next
my
back
right
between
my
shoulders
seemed
like
i
die
if
i
could
scratch
well
i
noticed
that
thing
plenty
times
since
if
you
are
with
the
quality
or
at
a
funeral
or
trying
to
go
to
sleep
when
you
sleepy
if
you
are
anywheres
where
it
wo
do
for
you
to
scratch
why
you
will
itch
all
over
in
upward
of
a
thousand
places
pretty
soon
jim
says
say
who
is
you
whar
is
you
dog
my
cats
ef
i
didn
hear
well
i
know
what
i
gwyne
to
do
i
gwyne
to
set
down
here
and
listen
tell
i
hears
it
so
he
set
down
on
the
ground
betwixt
me
and
tom
he
leaned
his
back
up
against
a
tree
and
stretched
his
legs
out
till
one
of
them
most
touched
one
of
mine
my
nose
begun
to
itch
it
itched
till
the
tears
come
into
my
eyes
but
i
das
scratch
then
it
begun
to
itch
on
the
inside
next
i
got
to
itching
underneath
i
did
know
how
i
was
going
to
set
still
this
miserableness
went
on
as
much
as
six
or
seven
minutes
but
it
seemed
a
sight
longer
than
that
i
was
itching
in
eleven
different
places
now
i
reckoned
i
could
stand
it
a
minute
longer
but
i
set
my
teeth
hard
and
got
ready
to
try
just
then
jim
begun
to
breathe
heavy
next
he
begun
to
snore
and
then
i
was
pretty
soon
comfortable
again
tom
he
made
a
sign
to
me
kind
of
a
little
noise
with
his
mouth
and
we
went
creeping
away
on
our
hands
and
knees
when
we
was
ten
foot
off
tom
whispered
to
me
and
wanted
to
tie
jim
to
the
tree
for
fun
but
i
said
no
he
might
wake
and
make
a
disturbance
and
then
they
find
out
i
war
in
then
tom
said
he
had
got
candles
enough
and
he
would
slip
in
the
kitchen
and
get
some
more
i
did
want
him
to
try
i
said
jim
might
wake
up
and
come
but
tom
wanted
to
resk
it
so
we
slid
in
there
and
got
three
candles
and
tom
laid
five
cents
on
the
table
for
pay
then
we
got
out
and
i
was
in
a
sweat
to
get
away
but
nothing
would
do
tom
but
he
must
crawl
to
where
jim
was
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
play
something
on
him
i
waited
and
it
seemed
a
good
while
everything
was
so
still
and
lonesome
as
soon
as
tom
was
back
we
cut
along
the
path
around
the
garden
fence
and
by
and
by
fetched
up
on
the
steep
top
of
the
hill
the
other
side
of
the
house
tom
said
he
slipped
jim
hat
off
of
his
head
and
hung
it
on
a
limb
right
over
him
and
jim
stirred
a
little
but
he
did
wake
afterward
jim
said
the
witches
bewitched
him
and
put
him
in
a
trance
and
rode
him
all
over
the
state
and
then
set
him
under
the
trees
again
and
hung
his
hat
on
a
limb
to
show
who
done
it
and
next
time
jim
told
it
he
said
they
rode
him
down
to
new
orleans
and
after
that
every
time
he
told
it
he
spread
it
more
and
more
till
by
and
by
he
said
they
rode
him
all
over
the
world
and
tired
him
most
to
death
and
his
back
was
all
over
jim
was
monstrous
proud
about
it
and
he
got
so
he
would
hardly
notice
the
other
niggers
niggers
would
come
miles
to
hear
jim
tell
about
it
and
he
was
more
looked
up
to
than
any
nigger
in
that
country
strange
niggers
would
stand
with
their
mouths
open
and
look
him
all
over
same
as
if
he
was
a
wonder
niggers
is
always
talking
about
witches
in
the
dark
by
the
kitchen
fire
but
whenever
one
was
talking
and
letting
on
to
know
all
about
such
things
jim
would
happen
in
and
say
hm
what
you
know
witches
and
that
nigger
was
corked
up
and
had
to
take
a
back
seat
jim
always
kept
that
piece
round
his
neck
with
a
string
and
said
it
was
a
charm
the
devil
give
to
him
with
his
own
hands
and
told
him
he
could
cure
anybody
with
it
and
fetch
witches
whenever
he
wanted
to
just
by
saying
something
to
it
but
he
never
told
what
it
was
he
said
to
it
niggers
would
come
from
all
around
there
and
give
jim
anything
they
had
just
for
a
sight
of
that
piece
but
they
would
touch
it
because
the
devil
had
had
his
hands
on
it
jim
was
most
ruined
for
a
servant
because
he
got
stuck
up
on
account
of
having
seen
the
devil
and
been
rode
by
witches
well
when
tom
and
me
got
to
the
edge
of
the
hilltop
we
looked
away
down
into
the
village
and
could
see
three
or
four
lights
twinkling
where
there
was
sick
folks
maybe
and
the
stars
over
us
was
sparkling
ever
so
fine
and
down
by
the
village
was
the
river
a
whole
mile
broad
and
awful
still
and
grand
we
went
down
the
hill
and
found
joe
harper
and
ben
rogers
and
two
or
three
more
of
the
boys
hid
in
the
old
tanyard
so
we
unhitched
a
skiff
and
pulled
down
the
river
two
mile
and
a
half
to
the
big
scar
on
the
hillside
and
went
ashore
we
went
to
a
clump
of
bushes
and
tom
made
everybody
swear
to
keep
the
secret
and
then
showed
them
a
hole
in
the
hill
right
in
the
thickest
part
of
the
bushes
then
we
lit
the
candles
and
crawled
in
on
our
hands
and
knees
we
went
about
two
hundred
yards
and
then
the
cave
opened
up
tom
poked
about
amongst
the
passages
and
pretty
soon
ducked
under
a
wall
where
you
would
noticed
that
there
was
a
hole
we
went
along
a
narrow
place
and
got
into
a
kind
of
room
all
damp
and
sweaty
and
cold
and
there
we
stopped
tom
says
now
we
start
this
band
of
robbers
and
call
it
tom
sawyer
gang
everybody
that
wants
to
join
has
got
to
take
an
oath
and
write
his
name
in
blood
everybody
was
willing
so
tom
got
out
a
sheet
of
paper
that
he
had
wrote
the
oath
on
and
read
it
it
swore
every
boy
to
stick
to
the
band
and
never
tell
any
of
the
secrets
and
if
anybody
done
anything
to
any
boy
in
the
band
whichever
boy
was
ordered
to
kill
that
person
and
his
family
must
do
it
and
he
must
eat
and
he
must
sleep
till
he
had
killed
them
and
hacked
a
cross
in
their
breasts
which
was
the
sign
of
the
band
and
nobody
that
did
belong
to
the
band
could
use
that
mark
and
if
he
did
he
must
be
sued
and
if
he
done
it
again
he
must
be
killed
and
if
anybody
that
belonged
to
the
band
told
the
secrets
he
must
have
his
throat
cut
and
then
have
his
carcass
burnt
up
and
the
ashes
scattered
all
around
and
his
name
blotted
off
the
list
with
blood
and
never
mentioned
again
by
the
gang
but
have
a
curse
put
on
it
and
be
forgot
forever
everybody
said
it
was
a
real
beautiful
oath
and
asked
tom
if
he
got
it
out
of
his
own
head
he
said
some
of
it
but
the
rest
was
out
of
and
and
every
gang
that
was
had
it
some
thought
it
would
be
good
to
kill
the
of
boys
that
told
the
secrets
tom
said
it
was
a
good
idea
so
he
took
a
pencil
and
wrote
it
in
then
ben
rogers
says
here
huck
finn
he
hai
got
no
family
what
you
going
to
do
him
well
hai
he
got
a
father
says
tom
sawyer
yes
he
got
a
father
but
you
ca
never
find
him
these
days
he
used
to
lay
drunk
with
the
hogs
in
the
tanyard
but
he
hai
been
seen
in
these
parts
for
a
year
or
more
they
talked
it
over
and
they
was
going
to
rule
me
out
because
they
said
every
boy
must
have
a
family
or
somebody
to
kill
or
else
it
would
be
fair
and
square
for
the
others
well
nobody
could
think
of
anything
to
do
everybody
was
stumped
and
set
still
i
was
most
ready
to
cry
but
all
at
once
i
thought
of
a
way
and
so
i
offered
them
miss
watson
they
could
kill
her
everybody
said
oh
she
do
that
all
right
huck
can
come
in
then
they
all
stuck
a
pin
in
their
fingers
to
get
blood
to
sign
with
and
i
made
my
mark
on
the
paper
now
says
ben
rogers
what
the
line
of
business
of
this
gang
nothing
only
robbery
and
murder
tom
said
but
who
are
we
going
to
rob
houses
or
cattle
or
stuff
stealing
cattle
and
such
things
ai
robbery
it
burglary
says
tom
sawyer
we
ai
burglars
that
ai
no
sort
of
style
we
are
highwaymen
we
stop
stages
and
carriages
on
the
road
with
masks
on
and
kill
the
people
and
take
their
watches
and
money
must
we
always
kill
the
people
oh
certainly
it
best
some
authorities
think
different
but
mostly
it
considered
best
to
kill
them
except
some
that
you
bring
to
the
cave
here
and
keep
them
till
they
ransomed
ransomed
what
that
i
do
know
but
that
what
they
do
i
seen
it
in
books
and
so
of
course
that
what
we
got
to
do
but
how
can
we
do
it
if
we
do
know
what
it
is
why
blame
it
all
we
to
do
it
do
i
tell
you
it
in
the
books
do
you
want
to
go
to
doing
different
from
what
in
the
books
and
get
things
all
muddled
up
oh
that
all
very
fine
to
tom
sawyer
but
how
in
the
nation
are
these
fellows
going
to
be
ransomed
if
we
do
know
how
to
do
it
to
them
that
the
thing
i
want
to
get
at
now
what
do
you
reckon
it
is
well
i
do
know
but
if
we
keep
them
till
ransomed
it
means
that
we
keep
them
till
they
dead
now
that
something
that
answer
why
could
you
said
that
before
we
keep
them
till
they
ransomed
to
death
and
a
bothersome
lot
they
be
too
eating
up
everything
and
always
trying
to
get
loose
how
you
talk
ben
rogers
how
can
they
get
loose
when
there
a
guard
over
them
ready
to
shoot
them
down
if
they
move
a
peg
a
guard
well
that
good
so
somebody
got
to
set
up
all
night
and
never
get
any
sleep
just
so
as
to
watch
them
i
think
foolishness
why
ca
a
body
take
a
club
and
ransom
them
as
soon
as
they
get
here
because
it
ai
in
the
books
so
that
why
now
ben
rogers
do
you
want
to
do
things
regular
or
do
you
that
the
idea
do
you
reckon
that
the
people
that
made
the
books
knows
what
the
correct
thing
to
do
do
you
reckon
can
learn
anything
not
by
a
good
deal
no
sir
we
just
go
on
and
ransom
them
in
the
regular
way
all
right
i
do
mind
but
i
say
it
a
fool
way
anyhow
say
do
we
kill
the
women
too
well
ben
rogers
if
i
was
as
ignorant
as
you
i
would
let
on
kill
the
women
no
nobody
ever
saw
anything
in
the
books
like
that
you
fetch
them
to
the
cave
and
you
always
as
polite
as
pie
to
them
and
by
and
by
they
fall
in
love
with
you
and
never
want
to
go
home
any
more
well
if
that
the
way
i
agreed
but
i
do
take
no
stock
in
it
mighty
soon
we
have
the
cave
so
cluttered
up
with
women
and
fellows
waiting
to
be
ransomed
that
there
wo
be
no
place
for
the
robbers
but
go
ahead
i
ai
got
nothing
to
say
little
tommy
barnes
was
asleep
now
and
when
they
waked
him
up
he
was
scared
and
cried
and
said
he
wanted
to
go
home
to
his
ma
and
want
to
be
a
robber
any
more
so
they
all
made
fun
of
him
and
called
him
and
that
made
him
mad
and
he
said
he
would
go
straight
and
tell
all
the
secrets
but
tom
give
him
five
cents
to
keep
quiet
and
said
we
would
all
go
home
and
meet
next
week
and
rob
somebody
and
kill
some
people
ben
rogers
said
he
could
get
out
much
only
sundays
and
so
he
wanted
to
begin
next
sunday
but
all
the
boys
said
it
would
be
wicked
to
do
it
on
sunday
and
that
settled
the
thing
they
agreed
to
get
together
and
fix
a
day
as
soon
as
they
could
and
then
we
elected
tom
sawyer
first
captain
and
joe
harper
second
captain
of
the
gang
and
so
started
home
i
clumb
up
the
shed
and
crept
into
my
window
just
before
day
was
breaking
my
new
clothes
was
all
greased
up
and
clayey
and
i
was
chapter
iii
well
i
got
a
good
in
the
morning
from
old
miss
watson
on
account
of
my
clothes
but
the
widow
she
did
scold
but
only
cleaned
off
the
grease
and
clay
and
looked
so
sorry
that
i
thought
i
would
behave
awhile
if
i
could
then
miss
watson
she
took
me
in
the
closet
and
prayed
but
nothing
come
of
it
she
told
me
to
pray
every
day
and
whatever
i
asked
for
i
would
get
it
but
it
war
so
i
tried
it
once
i
got
a
but
no
hooks
it
war
any
good
to
me
without
hooks
i
tried
for
the
hooks
three
or
four
times
but
somehow
i
could
make
it
work
by
and
by
one
day
i
asked
miss
watson
to
try
for
me
but
she
said
i
was
a
fool
she
never
told
me
why
and
i
could
make
it
out
no
way
i
set
down
one
time
back
in
the
woods
and
had
a
long
think
about
it
i
says
to
myself
if
a
body
can
get
anything
they
pray
for
why
deacon
winn
get
back
the
money
he
lost
on
pork
why
ca
the
widow
get
back
her
silver
that
was
stole
why
ca
miss
watson
fat
up
no
says
i
to
myself
there
ai
nothing
in
it
i
went
and
told
the
widow
about
it
and
she
said
the
thing
a
body
could
get
by
praying
for
it
was
spiritual
gifts
this
was
too
many
for
me
but
she
told
me
what
she
meant
i
must
help
other
people
and
do
everything
i
could
for
other
people
and
look
out
for
them
all
the
time
and
never
think
about
myself
this
was
including
miss
watson
as
i
took
it
i
went
out
in
the
woods
and
turned
it
over
in
my
mind
a
long
time
but
i
could
see
no
advantage
about
it
except
for
the
other
people
so
at
last
i
reckoned
i
would
worry
about
it
any
more
but
just
let
it
go
sometimes
the
widow
would
take
me
one
side
and
talk
about
providence
in
a
way
to
make
a
body
mouth
water
but
maybe
next
day
miss
watson
would
take
hold
and
knock
it
all
down
again
i
judged
i
could
see
that
there
was
two
providences
and
a
poor
chap
would
stand
considerable
show
with
the
widow
providence
but
if
miss
watson
got
him
there
war
no
help
for
him
any
more
i
thought
it
all
out
and
reckoned
i
would
belong
to
the
widow
if
he
wanted
me
though
i
could
make
out
how
he
was
to
be
any
better
off
then
than
what
he
was
before
seeing
i
was
so
ignorant
and
so
kind
of
and
ornery
pap
he
had
been
seen
for
more
than
a
year
and
that
was
comfortable
for
me
i
did
want
to
see
him
no
more
he
used
to
always
whale
me
when
he
was
sober
and
could
get
his
hands
on
me
though
i
used
to
take
to
the
woods
most
of
the
time
when
he
was
around
well
about
this
time
he
was
found
in
the
river
drownded
about
twelve
mile
above
town
so
people
said
they
judged
it
was
him
anyway
said
this
drownded
man
was
just
his
size
and
was
ragged
and
had
uncommon
long
hair
which
was
all
like
pap
but
they
could
make
nothing
out
of
the
face
because
it
had
been
in
the
water
so
long
it
war
much
like
a
face
at
all
they
said
he
was
floating
on
his
back
in
the
water
they
took
him
and
buried
him
on
the
bank
but
i
war
comfortable
long
because
i
happened
to
think
of
something
i
knowed
mighty
well
that
a
drownded
man
do
float
on
his
back
but
on
his
face
so
i
knowed
then
that
this
war
pap
but
a
woman
dressed
up
in
a
man
clothes
so
i
was
uncomfortable
again
i
judged
the
old
man
would
turn
up
again
by
and
by
though
i
wished
he
would
we
played
robber
now
and
then
about
a
month
and
then
i
resigned
all
the
boys
did
we
had
robbed
nobody
had
killed
any
people
but
only
just
pretended
we
used
to
hop
out
of
the
woods
and
go
charging
down
on
and
women
in
carts
taking
garden
stuff
to
market
but
we
never
hived
any
of
them
tom
sawyer
called
the
hogs
ingots
and
he
called
the
turnips
and
stuff
julery
and
we
would
go
to
the
cave
and
powwow
over
what
we
had
done
and
how
many
people
we
had
killed
and
marked
but
i
could
see
no
profit
in
it
one
time
tom
sent
a
boy
to
run
about
town
with
a
blazing
stick
which
he
called
a
slogan
which
was
the
sign
for
the
gang
to
get
together
and
then
he
said
he
had
got
secret
news
by
his
spies
that
next
day
a
whole
parcel
of
spanish
merchants
and
rich
was
going
to
camp
in
cave
hollow
with
two
hundred
elephants
and
six
hundred
camels
and
over
a
thousand
sumter
mules
all
loaded
down
with
and
they
did
have
only
a
guard
of
four
hundred
soldiers
and
so
we
would
lay
in
ambuscade
as
he
called
it
and
kill
the
lot
and
scoop
the
things
he
said
we
must
slick
up
our
swords
and
guns
and
get
ready
he
never
could
go
after
even
a
but
he
must
have
the
swords
and
guns
all
scoured
up
for
it
though
they
was
only
lath
and
broomsticks
and
you
might
scour
at
them
till
you
rotted
and
then
they
war
worth
a
mouthful
of
ashes
more
than
what
they
was
before
i
did
believe
we
could
lick
such
a
crowd
of
spaniards
and
but
i
wanted
to
see
the
camels
and
elephants
so
i
was
on
hand
next
day
saturday
in
the
ambuscade
and
when
we
got
the
word
we
rushed
out
of
the
woods
and
down
the
hill
but
there
war
no
spaniards
and
and
there
war
no
camels
nor
no
elephants
it
war
anything
but
a
picnic
and
only
a
primer
class
at
that
we
busted
it
up
and
chased
the
children
up
the
hollow
but
we
never
got
anything
but
some
doughnuts
and
jam
though
ben
rogers
got
a
rag
doll
and
joe
harper
got
a
and
a
tract
and
then
the
teacher
charged
in
and
made
us
drop
everything
and
cut
i
did
see
no
and
i
told
tom
sawyer
so
he
said
there
was
loads
of
them
there
anyway
and
he
said
there
was
there
too
and
elephants
and
things
i
said
why
could
we
see
them
then
he
said
if
i
war
so
ignorant
but
had
read
a
book
called
don
quixote
i
would
know
without
asking
he
said
it
was
all
done
by
enchantment
he
said
there
was
hundreds
of
soldiers
there
and
elephants
and
treasure
and
so
on
but
we
had
enemies
which
he
called
magicians
and
they
had
turned
the
whole
thing
into
an
infant
just
out
of
spite
i
said
all
right
then
the
thing
for
us
to
do
was
to
go
for
the
magicians
tom
sawyer
said
i
was
a
numskull
why
said
he
a
magician
could
call
up
a
lot
of
genies
and
they
would
hash
you
up
like
nothing
before
you
could
say
jack
robinson
they
are
as
tall
as
a
tree
and
as
big
around
as
a
church
well
i
says
we
got
some
genies
to
help
ca
we
lick
the
other
crowd
then
how
you
going
to
get
them
i
do
know
how
do
get
them
why
they
rub
an
old
tin
lamp
or
an
iron
ring
and
then
the
genies
come
tearing
in
with
the
thunder
and
lightning
around
and
the
smoke
and
everything
they
told
to
do
they
up
and
do
it
they
do
think
nothing
of
pulling
a
up
by
the
roots
and
belting
a
superintendent
over
the
head
with
it
or
any
other
man
who
makes
them
tear
around
so
why
whoever
rubs
the
lamp
or
the
ring
they
belong
to
whoever
rubs
the
lamp
or
the
ring
and
they
got
to
do
whatever
he
says
if
he
tells
them
to
build
a
palace
forty
miles
long
out
of
and
fill
it
full
of
or
whatever
you
want
and
fetch
an
emperor
daughter
from
china
for
you
to
marry
they
got
to
do
it
and
they
got
to
do
it
before
next
morning
too
and
more
they
got
to
waltz
that
palace
around
over
the
country
wherever
you
want
it
you
understand
well
says
i
i
think
they
are
a
pack
of
flatheads
for
not
keeping
the
palace
themselves
of
fooling
them
away
like
that
and
what
more
if
i
was
one
of
them
i
would
see
a
man
in
jericho
before
i
would
drop
my
business
and
come
to
him
for
the
rubbing
of
an
old
tin
lamp
how
you
talk
huck
finn
why
you
to
come
when
he
rubbed
it
whether
you
wanted
to
or
not
what
and
i
as
high
as
a
tree
and
as
big
as
a
church
all
right
then
i
come
but
i
lay
i
make
that
man
climb
the
highest
tree
there
was
in
the
country
shucks
it
ai
no
use
to
talk
to
you
huck
finn
you
do
seem
to
know
anything
somehow
perfect
saphead
i
thought
all
this
over
for
two
or
three
days
and
then
i
reckoned
i
would
see
if
there
was
anything
in
it
i
got
an
old
tin
lamp
and
an
iron
ring
and
went
out
in
the
woods
and
rubbed
and
rubbed
till
i
sweat
like
an
injun
calculating
to
build
a
palace
and
sell
it
but
it
war
no
use
none
of
the
genies
come
so
then
i
judged
that
all
that
stuff
was
only
just
one
of
tom
sawyer
lies
i
reckoned
he
believed
in
the
and
the
elephants
but
as
for
me
i
think
different
it
had
all
the
marks
of
a
chapter
iv
well
three
or
four
months
run
along
and
it
was
well
into
the
winter
now
i
had
been
to
school
most
all
the
time
and
could
spell
and
read
and
write
just
a
little
and
could
say
the
multiplication
table
up
to
six
times
seven
is
and
i
do
reckon
i
could
ever
get
any
further
than
that
if
i
was
to
live
forever
i
do
take
no
stock
in
mathematics
anyway
at
first
i
hated
the
school
but
by
and
by
i
got
so
i
could
stand
it
whenever
i
got
uncommon
tired
i
played
hookey
and
the
hiding
i
got
next
day
done
me
good
and
cheered
me
up
so
the
longer
i
went
to
school
the
easier
it
got
to
be
i
was
getting
sort
of
used
to
the
widow
ways
too
and
they
war
so
raspy
on
me
living
in
a
house
and
sleeping
in
a
bed
pulled
on
me
pretty
tight
mostly
but
before
the
cold
weather
i
used
to
slide
out
and
sleep
in
the
woods
sometimes
and
so
that
was
a
rest
to
me
i
liked
the
old
ways
best
but
i
was
getting
so
i
liked
the
new
ones
too
a
little
bit
the
widow
said
i
was
coming
along
slow
but
sure
and
doing
very
satisfactory
she
said
she
war
ashamed
of
me
one
morning
i
happened
to
turn
over
the
at
breakfast
i
reached
for
some
of
it
as
quick
as
i
could
to
throw
over
my
left
shoulder
and
keep
off
the
bad
luck
but
miss
watson
was
in
ahead
of
me
and
crossed
me
off
she
says
take
your
hands
away
huckleberry
what
a
mess
you
are
always
making
the
widow
put
in
a
good
word
for
me
but
that
war
going
to
keep
off
the
bad
luck
i
knowed
that
well
enough
i
started
out
after
breakfast
feeling
worried
and
shaky
and
wondering
where
it
was
going
to
fall
on
me
and
what
it
was
going
to
be
there
is
ways
to
keep
off
some
kinds
of
bad
luck
but
this
one
of
them
kind
so
i
never
tried
to
do
anything
but
just
poked
along
and
on
the
i
went
down
to
the
front
garden
and
clumb
over
the
stile
where
you
go
through
the
high
board
fence
there
was
an
inch
of
new
snow
on
the
ground
and
i
seen
somebody
tracks
they
had
come
up
from
the
quarry
and
stood
around
the
stile
awhile
and
then
went
on
around
the
garden
fence
it
was
funny
they
had
come
in
after
standing
around
so
i
could
make
it
out
it
was
very
curious
somehow
i
was
going
to
follow
around
but
i
stooped
down
to
look
at
the
tracks
first
i
did
notice
anything
at
first
but
next
i
did
there
was
a
cross
in
the
left
made
with
big
nails
to
keep
off
the
devil
i
was
up
in
a
second
and
shinning
down
the
hill
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
every
now
and
then
but
i
did
see
nobody
i
was
at
judge
thatcher
as
quick
as
i
could
get
there
he
said
why
my
boy
you
are
all
out
of
breath
did
you
come
for
your
interest
no
sir
i
says
is
there
some
for
me
oh
yes
a
is
in
last
night
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
quite
a
fortune
for
you
you
had
better
let
me
invest
it
along
with
your
six
thousand
because
if
you
take
it
you
spend
it
no
sir
i
says
i
do
want
to
spend
it
i
do
want
it
at
all
nor
the
six
thousand
nuther
i
want
you
to
take
it
i
want
to
give
it
to
you
the
six
thousand
and
all
he
looked
surprised
he
could
seem
to
make
it
out
he
says
why
what
can
you
mean
my
boy
i
says
do
you
ask
me
no
questions
about
it
please
you
take
it
wo
you
he
says
well
i
puzzled
is
something
the
matter
please
take
it
says
i
and
do
ask
me
nothing
then
i
wo
have
to
tell
no
lies
he
studied
awhile
and
then
he
says
i
think
i
see
you
want
to
all
your
property
to
me
not
give
it
that
the
correct
idea
then
he
wrote
something
on
a
paper
and
read
it
over
and
says
there
you
see
it
says
a
consideration
that
means
i
have
bought
it
of
you
and
paid
you
for
it
here
a
dollar
for
you
now
you
sign
it
so
i
signed
it
and
left
miss
watson
nigger
jim
had
a
as
big
as
your
fist
which
had
been
took
out
of
the
fourth
stomach
of
an
ox
and
he
used
to
do
magic
with
it
he
said
there
was
a
spirit
inside
of
it
and
it
knowed
everything
so
i
went
to
him
that
night
and
told
him
pap
was
here
again
for
i
found
his
tracks
in
the
snow
what
i
wanted
to
know
was
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
was
he
going
to
stay
jim
got
out
his
and
said
something
over
it
and
then
he
held
it
up
and
dropped
it
on
the
floor
it
fell
pretty
solid
and
only
rolled
about
an
inch
jim
tried
it
again
and
then
another
time
and
it
acted
just
the
same
jim
got
down
on
his
knees
and
put
his
ear
against
it
and
listened
but
it
war
no
use
he
said
it
would
talk
he
said
sometimes
it
would
talk
without
money
i
told
him
i
had
an
old
slick
counterfeit
quarter
that
war
no
good
because
the
brass
showed
through
the
silver
a
little
and
it
would
pass
nohow
even
if
the
brass
did
show
because
it
was
so
slick
it
felt
greasy
and
so
that
would
tell
on
it
every
time
i
reckoned
i
would
say
nothing
about
the
dollar
i
got
from
the
judge
i
said
it
was
pretty
bad
money
but
maybe
the
would
take
it
because
maybe
it
would
know
the
difference
jim
smelt
it
and
bit
it
and
rubbed
it
and
said
he
would
manage
so
the
would
think
it
was
good
he
said
he
would
split
open
a
raw
irish
potato
and
stick
the
quarter
in
between
and
keep
it
there
all
night
and
next
morning
you
could
see
no
brass
and
it
would
feel
greasy
no
more
and
so
anybody
in
town
would
take
it
in
a
minute
let
alone
a
well
i
knowed
a
potato
would
do
that
before
but
i
had
forgot
it
jim
put
the
quarter
under
the
and
got
down
and
listened
again
this
time
he
said
the
was
all
right
he
said
it
would
tell
my
whole
fortune
if
i
wanted
it
to
i
says
go
on
so
the
talked
to
jim
and
jim
told
it

me
he

and
went
up
to
my
room
that
night
there
sat
pap
his
own
self
chapter
v
i
had
shut
the
door
to
then
i
turned
around
and
there
he
was
i
used
to
be
scared
of
him
all
the
time
he
tanned
me
so
much
i
reckoned
i
was
scared
now
too
but
in
a
minute
i
see
i
was
mistaken
that
is
after
the
first
jolt
as
you
may
say
when
my
breath
sort
of
hitched
he
being
so
unexpected
but
right
away
after
i
see
i
war
scared
of
him
worth
bothring
about
he
was
most
fifty
and
he
looked
it
his
hair
was
long
and
tangled
and
greasy
and
hung
down
and
you
could
see
his
eyes
shining
through
like
he
was
behind
vines
it
was
all
black
no
gray
so
was
his
long
whiskers
there
war
no
color
in
his
face
where
his
face
showed
it
was
white
not
like
another
man
white
but
a
white
to
make
a
body
sick
a
white
to
make
a
body
flesh
crawl
a
white
a
white
as
for
his
clothes
just
rags
that
was
all
he
had
one
ankle
resting
on
knee
the
boot
on
that
foot
was
busted
and
two
of
his
toes
stuck
through
and
he
worked
them
now
and
then
his
hat
was
laying
on
the
floor
an
old
black
slouch
with
the
top
caved
in
like
a
lid
i
stood
at
him

set
there
at
me

his
chair

my
guardian
but
it
was
a
new
judge
that
had
just
come
and
he
did
know
the
old
man
so
he
said
courts
must
interfere
and
separate
families
if
they
could
help
it
said
he
druther
not
take
a
child
away
from
its
father
so
judge
thatcher
and
the
widow
had
to
quit
on
the
business
that
pleased
the
old
man
till
he
could
rest
he
said
he
cowhide
me
till
i
was
black
and
blue
if
i
did
raise
some
money
for
him
i
borrowed
three
dollars
from
judge
thatcher
and
pap
took
it
and
got
drunk
and
went
around
and
cussing
and
whooping
and
carrying
on
and
he
kept
it
up
all
over
town
with
a
tin
pan
till
most
midnight
then
they
jailed
him
and
next
day
they
had
him
before
court
and
jailed
him
again
for
a
week
but
he
said
was
satisfied
said
he
was
boss
of
his
son
and
he
make
it
warm
for
when
he
got
out
the
new
judge
said
he
was
to
make
a
man
of
him
so
he
took
him
to
his
own
house
and
dressed
him
up
clean
and
nice
and
had
him
to
breakfast
and
dinner
and
supper
with
the
family
and
was
just
old
pie
to
him
so
to
speak
and
after
supper
he
talked
to
him
about
temperance
and
such
things
till
the
old
man
cried
and
said
he
been
a
fool
and
fooled
away
his
life
but
now
he
was
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
be
a
man
nobody
would
be
ashamed
of
and
he
hoped
the
judge
would
help
him
and
not
look
down
on
him
the
judge
said
he
could
hug
him
for
them
words
so
he
cried
and
his
wife
she
cried
again
pap
said
he
been
a
man
that
had
always
been
misunderstood
before
and
the
judge
said
he
believed
it
the
old
man
said
that
what
a
man
wanted
that
was
down
was
sympathy
and
the
judge
said
it
was
so
so
they
cried
again
and
when
it
was
bedtime
the
old
man
rose
up
and
held
out
his
hand
and
says
look
at
it
gentlemen
and
ladies
all
take
of
it
shake
it
there
a
hand
that
was
the
hand
of
a
hog
but
it
ai
so
no
more
it
the
hand
of
a
man
that
started
in
on
a
new
life
and
die
before
he
go
back
you
mark
them
words
do
forget
i
said
them
it
a
clean
hand
now
shake
it
do
be
afeard
so
they
shook
it
one
after
the
other
all
around
and
cried
the
judge
wife
she
kissed
it
then
the
old
man
he
signed
a
pledge
made
his
mark
the
judge
said
it
was
the
holiest
time
on
record
or
something
like
that
then
they
tucked
the
old
man
into
a
beautiful
room
which
was
the
spare
room
and
in
the
night
some
time
he
got
powerful
thirsty
and
clumb
out
on
to
the
and
slid
down
a
stanchion
and
traded
his
new
coat
for
a
jug
of
and
clumb
back
again
and
had
a
good
old
time
and
toward
daylight
he
crawled
out
again
drunk
as
a
fiddler
and
rolled
off
the
porch
and
broke
his
left
arm
in
two
places
and
was
most
froze
to
death
when
somebody
found
him
after
and
when
they
come
to
look
at
that
spare
room
they
had
to
take
soundings
before
they
could
navigate
it
the
judge
he
felt
kind
of
sore
he
said
he
reckoned
a
body
could
reform
the
old
man
with
a
shotgun
maybe
but
he
did
know
no
other
way
chapter
vi
well
pretty
soon
the
old
man
was
up
and
around
again
and
then
he
went
for
judge
thatcher
in
the
courts
to
make
him
give
up
that
money
and
he
went
for
me
too
for
not
stopping
school
he
catched
me
a
couple
of
times
and
thrashed
me
but
i
went
to
school
just
the
same
and
dodged
him
or
outrun
him
most
of
the
time
i
did
want
to
go
to
school
much
before
but
i
reckoned
i
go
now
to
spite
pap
that
law
trial
was
a
slow
business
appeared
like
they
war
ever
going
to
get
started
on
it
so
every
now
and
then
i
borrow
two
or
three
dollars
off
of
the
judge
for
him
to
keep
from
getting
a
cowhiding
every
time
he
got
money
he
got
drunk
and
every
time
he
got
drunk
he
raised
cain
around
town
and
every
time
he
raised
cain
he
got
jailed
he
was
just
suited
this
kind
of
thing
was
right
in
his
line
he
got
to
hanging
around
the
widow
too
much
and
so
she
told
him
at
last
that
if
he
did
quit
using
around
there
she
would
make
trouble
for
him
well
he
mad
he
said
he
would
show
who
was
huck
finn
boss
so
he
watched
out
for
me
one
day
in
the
spring
and
catched
me
and
took
me
up
the
river
about
three
mile
in
a
skiff
and
crossed
over
to
the
illinois
shore
where
it
was
woody
and
there
no
houses
but
an
old
log
hut
in
a
place
where
the
timber
was
so
thick
you
could
find
it
if
you
did
know
where
it
was
he
kept
me
with
him
all
the
time
and
i
never
got
a
chance
to
run
off
we
lived
in
that
old
cabin
and
he
always
locked
the
door
and
put
the
key
under
his
head
nights
he
had
a
gun
which
he
had
stole
i
reckon
and
we
fished
and
hunted
and
that
was
what
we
lived
on
every
little
while
he
locked
me
in
and
went
down
to
the
store
three
miles
to
the
ferry
and
traded
fish
and
game
for
whisky
and
fetched
it
home
and
got
drunk
and
had
a
good
time
and
licked
me
the
widow
she
found
out
where
i
was
by
and
by
and
she
sent
a
man
over
to
try
to
get
hold
of
me
but
pap
drove
him
off
with
the
gun
and
it
war
long
after
that
till
i
was
used
to
being
where
i
was
and
liked
it
all
but
the
cowhide
part
it
was
kind
of
lazy
and
jolly
laying
off
comfortable
all
day
smoking
and
fishing
and
no
books
nor
study
two
months
or
more
run
along
and
my
clothes
got
to
be
all
rags
and
dirt
and
i
did
see
how
i
ever
got
to
like
it
so
well
at
the
widow
where
you
had
to
wash
and
eat
on
a
plate
and
comb
up
and
go
to
bed
and
get
up
regular
and
be
forever
bothering
over
a
book
and
have
old
miss
watson
pecking
at
you
all
the
time
i
did
want
to
go
back
no
more
i
had
stopped
cussing
because
the
widow
did
like
it
but
now
i
took
to
it
again
because
pap
had
no
objections
it
was
pretty
good
times
up
in
the
woods
there
take
it
all
around
but
by
and
by
pap
got
too
handy
with
his
and
i
could
stand
it
i
was
all
over
welts
he
got
to
going
away
so
much
too
and
locking
me
in
once
he
locked
me
in
and
was
gone
three
days
it
was
dreadful
lonesome
i
judged
he
had
got
drownded
and
i
was
ever
going
to
get
out
any
more
i
was
scared
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
fix
up
some
way
to
leave
there
i
had
tried
to
get
out
of
that
cabin
many
a
time
but
i
could
find
no
way
there
war
a
window
to
it
big
enough
for
a
dog
to
get
through
i
could
get
up
the
chimbly
it
was
too
narrow
the
door
was
thick
solid
oak
slabs
pap
was
pretty
careful
not
to
leave
a
knife
or
anything
in
the
cabin
when
he
was
away
i
reckon
i
had
hunted
the
place
over
as
much
as
a
hundred
times
well
i
was
most
all
the
time
at
it
because
it
was
about
the
only
way
to
put
in
the
time
but
this
time
i
found
something
at
last
i
found
an
old
rusty
without
any
handle
it
was
laid
in
between
a
rafter
and
the
clapboards
of
the
roof
i
greased
it
up
and
went
to
work
there
was
an
old
nailed
against
the
logs
at
the
far
end
of
the
cabin
behind
the
table
to
keep
the
wind
from
blowing
through
the
chinks
and
putting
the
candle
out
i
got
under
the
table
and
raised
the
blanket
and
went
to
work
to
saw
a
section
of
the
big
bottom
log
out
big
enough
to
let
me
through
well
it
was
a
good
long
job
but
i
was
getting
toward
the
end
of
it
when
i
heard
pap
gun
in
the
woods
i
got
rid
of
the
signs
of
my
work
and
dropped
the
blanket
and
hid
my
saw
and
pretty
soon
pap
come
in
pap
war
in
a
good
humor
so
he
was
his
natural
self
he
said
he
was
and
everything
was
going
wrong
his
lawyer
said
he
reckoned
he
would
win
his
lawsuit
and
get
the
money
if
they
ever
got
started
on
the
trial
but
then
there
was
ways
to
put
it
off
a
long
time
and
judge
thatcher
knowed
how
to
do
it
and
he
said
people
allowed
be
another
trial
to
get
me
away
from
him
and
give
me
to
the
widow
for
my
guardian
and
they
guessed
it
would
win
this
time
this
shook
me
up
considerable
because
i
did
want
to
go
back
to
the
widow
any
more
and
be
so
cramped
up
and
sivilized
as
they
called
it
then
the
old
man
got
to
cussing
and
cussed
everything
and
everybody
he
could
think
of
and
then
cussed
them
all
over
again
to
make
sure
he
had
skipped
any
and
after
that
he
polished
off
with
a
kind
of
a
general
cuss
all
round
including
a
considerable
parcel
of
people
which
he
did
know
the
names
of
and
so
called
them
when
he
got
to
them
and
went
right
along
with
his
cussing
he
said
he
would
like
to
see
the
widow
get
me
he
said
he
would
watch
out
and
if
they
tried
to
come
any
such
game
on
him
he
knowed
of
a
place
six
or
seven
mile
off
to
stow
me
in
where
they
might
hunt
till
they
dropped
and
they
could
find
me
that
made
me
pretty
uneasy
again
but
only
for
a
minute
i
reckoned
i
would
stay
on
hand
till
he
got
that
chance
the
old
man
made
me
go
to
the
skiff
and
fetch
the
things
he
had
got
there
was
a
sack
of
corn
meal
and
a
side
of
bacon
ammunition
and
a
jug
of
whisky
and
an
old
book
and
two
newspapers
for
wadding
besides
some
tow
i
toted
up
a
load
and
went
back
and
set
down
on
the
bow
of
the
skiff
to
rest
i
thought
it
all
over
and
i
reckoned
i
would
walk
off
with
the
gun
and
some
lines
and
take
to
the
woods
when
i
run
away
i
guessed
i
would
stay
in
one
place
but
just
tramp
right
across
the
country
mostly
and
hunt
and
fish
to
keep
alive
and
so
get
so
far
away
that
the
old
man
nor
the
widow
could
ever
find
me
any
more
i
judged
i
would
saw
out
and
leave
that
night
if
pap
got
drunk
enough
and
i
reckoned
he
would
i
got
so
full
of
it
i
did
notice
how
long
i
was
staying
till
the
old
man
hollered
and
asked
me
whether
i
was
asleep
or
drownded
i
got
the
things
all
up
to
the
cabin
and
then
it
was
about
dark
while
i
was
cooking
supper
the
old
man
took
a
swig
or
two
and
got
sort
of
warmed
up
and
went
to
ripping
again
he
had
been
drunk
over
in
town
and
laid
in
the
gutter
all
night
and
he
was
a
sight
to
look
at
a
body
would
thought
he
was
adam
he
was
just
all
mud
whenever
his
liquor
begun
to
work
he
most
always
went
for
the
govment
this
time
he
says
call
this
a
govment
why
just
look
at
it
and
see
what
it
like
here
the
law
ready
to
take
a
man
son
away
from
him
a
man
own
son
which
he
has
had
all
the
trouble
and
all
the
anxiety
and
all
the
expense
of
raising
yes
just
as
that
man
has
got
that
son
raised
at
last
and
ready
to
go
to
work
and
begin
to
do
suthin
for
and
give
him
a
rest
the
law
up
and
goes
for
him
and
they
call
govment
that
ai
all
nuther
the
law
backs
that
old
judge
thatcher
up
and
helps
him
to
keep
me
out
o
my
property
here
what
the
law
does
the
law
takes
a
man
worth
six
thousand
dollars
and
and
jams
him
into
an
old
trap
of
a
cabin
like
this
and
lets
him
go
round
in
clothes
that
ai
fitten
for
a
hog
they
call
that
govment
a
man
ca
get
his
rights
in
a
govment
like
this
sometimes
i
a
mighty
notion
to
just
leave
the
country

good
and
all

i
so
i
told
old
thatcher

to
his
face
lots
of
heard

and
can
tell
what
i
said
says

for
two
cents

blamed
country
and
never
come

them
the
very
words
i
says
look
at
my
hat
if
you
call
it
a
hat
but
the
lid
raises
up
and
the
rest
of
it
goes
down
till
it
below
my
chin
and
then
it
ai
rightly
a
hat
at
all
but
more
like
my
head
was
shoved
up
through
a
jint
o

me
to

of
the
wealthiest
men
in
this
town

i
could
git
my
rights

as
what
he
had
and
he
had
a
gold
watch
and
chain
and
a
cane
the
awfulest
old
nabob
in
the
state
and
what
do
you
think
they
said
he
was
a
in
a
college
and
could
talk
all
kinds
of
languages
and
knowed
everything
and
that
ai
the
wust
they
said
he
could
when
he
was
at
home
well
that
let
me
out
thinks
i
what
is
the
country
to
it
was
day
and
i
was
just
about
to
go
and
vote
myself
if
i
too
drunk
to
get
there
but
when
they
told
me
there
was
a
state
in
this
country
where
they
let
that
nigger
vote
i
drawed
out
i
says
i
never
vote
them
the
very
words
i
said
they
all
heard
me
and
the
country
may
rot
for
all
me
i
never
vote
as
long
as
i
live
and
to
see
the
cool
way
of
that
nigger
why
he
give
me
the
road
if
i
had
shoved
him
out
o
the
way
i
says
to
the
people
why
ai
this
nigger
put
up
at
auction
and
sold
what
i
want
to
know
and
what
do
you
reckon
they
said
why
they
said
he
could
be
sold
till
he
been
in
the
state
six
months
and
he
had
been
there
that
long
yet
there
now
that
a
specimen
they
call
that
a
govment
that
ca
sell
a
free
nigger
till
he
been
in
the
state
six
months
here
a
govment
that
calls
itself
a
govment
and
lets
on
to
be
a
govment
and
thinks
it
is
a
govment
and
yet
got
to
set
for
six
whole
months
before
it
can
take
of
a
prowling
thieving
infernal
free
nigger
and
pap
was
on
so
he
never
noticed
where
his
old
limber
legs
was
taking
him
to
so
he
went
head
over
heels
over
the
tub
of
salt
pork
and
barked
both
shins
and
the
rest
of
his
speech
was
all
the
hottest
kind
of
language
mostly
hove
at
the
nigger
and
the
govment
though
he
give
the
tub
some
too
all
along
here
and
there
he
hopped
around
the
cabin
considerable
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
holding
first
one
shin
and
then
the
other
one
and
at
last
he
let
out
with
his
left
foot
all
of
a
sudden
and
fetched
the
tub
a
rattling
kick
but
it
war
good
judgment
because
that
was
the
boot
that
had
a
couple
of
his
toes
leaking
out
of
the
front
end
of
it
so
now
he
raised
a
howl
that
fairly
made
a
body
hair
raise
and
down
he
went
in
the
dirt
and
rolled
there
and
held
his
toes
and
the
cussing
he
done
then
laid
over
anything
he
had
ever
done
previous
he
said
so
his
own
self
afterwards
he
had
heard
old
sowberry
hagan
in
his
best
days
and
he
said
it
laid
over
him
too
but
i
reckon
that
was
sort
of
piling
it
on
maybe
after
supper
pap
took
the
jug
and
said
he
had
enough
whisky
there
for
two
drunks
and
one
delirium
tremens
that
was
always
his
word
i
judged
he
would
be
blind
drunk
in
about
an
hour
and
then
i
would
steal
the
key
or
saw
myself
out
one
or
he
drank
and
drank
and
tumbled
down
on
his
blankets
by
and
by
but
luck
did
run
my
way
he
did
go
sound
asleep
but
was
uneasy
he
groaned
and
moaned
and
thrashed
around
this
way
and
that
for
a
long
time
at
last
i
got
so
sleepy
i
could
keep
my
eyes
open
all
i
could
do
and
so
before
i
knowed
what
i
was
about
i
was
sound
asleep
and
the
candle
burning
i
do
know
how
long
i
was
asleep
but
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
an
awful
scream
and
i
was
up
there
was
pap
looking
wild
and
skipping
around
every
which
way
and
yelling
about
snakes
he
said
they
was
crawling
up
his
legs
and
then
he
would
give
a
jump
and
scream
and
say
one
had
bit
him
on
the
cheek
but
i
could
see
no
snakes
he
started
and
run
round
and
round
the
cabin
hollering
take
him
off
take
him
off
he
biting
me
on
the
neck
i
never
see
a
man
look
so
wild
in
the
eyes
pretty
soon
he
was
all
fagged
out
and
fell
down
panting
then
he
rolled
over
and
over
wonderful
fast
kicking
things
every
which
way
and
striking
and
grabbing
at
the
air
with
his
hands
and
screaming
and
saying
there
was
devils
of
him
he
wore
out
by
and
by
and
laid
still
awhile
moaning
then
he
laid
stiller
and
did
make
a
sound
i
could
hear
the
owls
and
the
wolves
away
off
in
the
woods
and
it
seemed
terrible
still
he
was
laying
over
by
the
corner
by
and
by
he
raised
up
part
way
and
listened
with
his
head
to
one
side
he
says
very
low
tramp
tramp
tramp
that
the
dead
tramp
tramp
tramp
coming
after
me
but
i
wo
go
oh
they
here
do
touch
me
do
hands
off
they
cold
let
go
oh
let
a
poor
devil
alone
then
he
went
down
on
all
fours
and
crawled
off
begging
them
to
let
him
alone
and
he
rolled
himself
up
in
his
blanket
and
wallowed
in
under
the
old
pine
table
still
and
then
he
went
to
crying
i
could
hear
him
through
the
blanket
by
and
by
he
rolled
out
and
jumped
up
on
his
feet
looking
wild
and
he
see
me
and
went
for
me
he
chased
me
round
and
round
the
place
with
a
calling
me
the
angel
of
death
and
saying
he
would
kill
me
and
then
i
could
come
for
him
no
more
i
begged
and
told
him
i
was
only
huck
but
he
laughed
a
screechy
laugh
and
roared
and
cussed
and
kept
on
chasing
me
up
once
when
i
turned
short
and
dodged
under
his
arm
he
made
a
grab
and
got
me
by
the
jacket
between
my
shoulders
and
i
thought
i
was
gone
but
i
slid
out
of
the
jacket
quick
as
lightning
and
saved
myself
pretty
soon
he
was
all
tired
out
and
dropped
down
with
his
back
against
the
door
and
said
he
would
rest
a
minute
and
then
kill
me
he
put
his
knife
under
him
and
said
he
would
sleep
and
get
strong
and
then
he
would
see
who
was
who
so
he
dozed
off
pretty
soon
by
and
by
i
got
the
old
chair
and
clumb
up
as
easy
as
i
could
not
to
make
any
noise
and
got
down
the
gun
i
slipped
the
ramrod
down
it
to
make
sure
it
was
loaded
and
then
i
laid
it
across
the
pointing
towards
pap
and
set
down
behind
it
to
wait
for
him
to
stir
and
how
slow
and
still
the
time
did
drag
along
chapter
vii
git
up
what
you
i
opened
my
eyes
and
looked
around
trying
to
make
out
where
i
was
it
was
after
and
i
had
been
sound
asleep
pap
was
standing
over
me
looking
sour
and
sick
too
he
says
what
you
doin
with
this
gun
i
judged
he
did
know
nothing
about
what
he
had
been
doing
so
i
says
somebody
tried
to
get
in
so
i
was
laying
for
him
why
did
you
roust
me
out
well
i
tried
to
but
i
could
i
could
budge
you
well
all
right
do
stand
there
palavering
all
day
but
out
with
you
and
see
if
there
a
fish
on
the
lines
for
breakfast
i
be
along
in
a
minute
he
unlocked
the
door
and
i
cleared
out
up
the
i
noticed
some
pieces
of
limbs
and
such
things
floating
down
and
a
sprinkling
of
bark
so
i
knowed
the
river
had
begun
to
rise
i
reckoned
i
would
have
great
times
now
if
i
was
over
at
the
town
the
june
rise
used
to
be
always
luck
for
me
because
as
soon
as
that
rise
begins
here
comes
cordwood
floating
down
and
pieces
of
log
rafts
sometimes
a
dozen
logs
together
so
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
catch
them
and
sell
them
to
the
woodyards
and
the
sawmill
i
went
along
up
the
bank
with
one
eye
out
for
pap
and
one
out
for
what
the
rise
might
fetch
along
well
all
at
once
here
comes
a
canoe
just
a
beauty
too
about
thirteen
or
fourteen
foot
long
riding
high
like
a
duck
i
shot
off
of
the
bank
like
a
frog
clothes
and
all
on
and
struck
out
for
the
canoe
i
just
expected
there
be
somebody
laying
down
in
it
because
people
often
done
that
to
fool
folks
and
when
a
chap
had
pulled
a
skiff
out
most
to
it
they
raise
up
and
laugh
at
him
but
it
war
so
this
time
it
was
a
sure
enough
and
i
clumb
in
and
paddled
her
ashore
thinks
i
the
old
man
will
be
glad
when
he
sees
this
she
worth
ten
dollars
but
when
i
got
to
shore
pap
was
in
sight
yet
and
as
i
was
running
her
into
a
little
creek
like
a
gully
all
hung
over
with
vines
and
willows
i
struck
another
idea
i
judged
i
hide
her
good
and
then
of
taking
to
the
woods
when
i
run
off
i
go
down
the
river
about
fifty
mile
and
camp
in
one
place
for
good
and
not
have
such
a
rough
time
tramping
on
foot
it
was
pretty
close
to
the
shanty
and
i
thought
i
heard
the
old
man
coming
all
the
time
but
i
got
her
hid
and
then
i
out
and
looked
around
a
bunch
of
willows
and
there
was
the
old
man
down
the
path
a
piece
just
drawing
a
bead
on
a
bird
with
his
gun
so
he
had
seen
anything
when
he
got
along
i
was
hard
at
it
taking
up
a
trot
line
he
abused
me
a
little
for
being
so
slow
but
i
told
him
i
fell
in
the
river
and
that
was
what
made
me
so
long
i
knowed
he
would
see
i
was
wet
and
then
he
would
be
asking
questions
we
got
five
catfish
off
the
lines
and
went
home
while
we
laid
off
after
breakfast
to
sleep
up
both
of
us
being
about
wore
out
i
got
to
thinking
that
if
i
could
fix
up
some
way
to
keep
pap
and
the
widow
from
trying
to
follow
me
it
would
be
a
certainer
thing
than
trusting
to
luck
to
get
far
enough
off
before
they
missed
me
you
see
all
kinds
of
things
might
happen
well
i
did
see
no
way
for
a
while
but
by
and
by
pap
raised
up
a
minute
to
drink
another
barrel
of
water
and
he
says
another
time
a
man
comes
round
here
you
roust
me
out
you
hear
that
man
war
here
for
no
good
i
a
shot
him
next
time
you
roust
me
out
you
hear
then
he
dropped
down
and
went
to
sleep
again
what
he
had
been
saying
give
me
the
very
idea
i
wanted
i
says
to
myself
i
can
fix
it
now
so
nobody
wo
think
of
following
me
about
twelve
we
turned
out
and
went
along
up
the
bank
the
river
was
coming
up
pretty
fast
and
lots
of
driftwood
going
by
on
the
rise
by
and
by
along
comes
part
of
a
log
raft
nine
logs
fast
together
we
went
out
with
the
skiff
and
towed
it
ashore
then
we
had
dinner
anybody
but
pap
would
waited
and
seen
the
day
through
so
as
to
catch
more
stuff
but
that
war
pap
style
nine
logs
was
enough
for
one
time
he
must
shove
right
over
to
town
and
sell
so
he
locked
me
in
and
took
the
skiff
and
started
off
towing
the
raft
about
half
past
three
i
judged
he
would
come
back
that
night
i
waited
till
i
reckoned
he
had
got
a
good
start
then
i
out
with
my
saw
and
went
to
work
on
that
log
again
before
he
was
side
of
the
river
i
was
out
of
the
hole
him
and
his
raft
was
just
a
speck
on
the
water
away
off
yonder
illustration
huckleberry
finn
i
took
the
sack
of
corn
meal
and
took
it
to
where
the
canoe
was
hid
and
shoved
the
vines
and
branches
apart
and
put
it
in
then
i
done
the
same
with
the
side
of
bacon
then
the
i
took
all
the
coffee
and
sugar
there
was
and
all
the
ammunition
i
took
the
wadding
i
took
the
bucket
and
gourd
took
a
dipper
and
a
tin
cup
and
my
old
saw
and
two
blankets
and
the
skillet
and
the
i
took
and
matches
and
other
things
everything
that
was
worth
a
cent
i
cleaned
out
the
place
i
wanted
an
ax
but
there
was
any
only
the
one
out
at
the
woodpile
and
i
knowed
why
i
was
going
to
leave
that
i
fetched
out
the
gun
and
now
i
was
done
i
had
wore
the
ground
a
good
deal
crawling
out
of
the
hole
and
dragging
out
so
many
things
so
i
fixed
that
as
good
as
i
could
from
the
outside
by
scattering
dust
on
the
place
which
covered
up
the
smoothness
and
the
sawdust
then
i
fixed
the
piece
of
log
back
into
its
place
and
put
two
rocks
under
it
and
one
against
it
to
hold
it
there
for
it
was
bent
up
at
that
place
and
did
quite
touch
ground
if
you
stood
four
or
five
foot
away
and
did
know
it
was
sawed
you
would
never
notice
it
and
besides
this
was
the
back
of
the
cabin
and
it
war
likely
anybody
would
go
fooling
around
there
it
was
all
grass
clear
to
the
canoe
so
i
had
left
a
track
i
followed
around
to
see
i
stood
on
the
bank
and
looked
out
over
the
river
all
safe
so
i
took
the
gun
and
went
up
a
piece
into
the
woods
and
was
hunting
around
for
some
birds
when
i
see
a
wild
pig
hogs
soon
went
wild
in
them
bottoms
after
they
had
got
away
from
the
i
shot
this
fellow
and
took
him
into
camp
i
took
the
ax
and
smashed
in
the
door
i
beat
it
and
hacked
it
considerable
it
i
fetched
the
pig
in
and
took
him
back
nearly
to
the
table
and
hacked
into
his
throat
with
the
ax
and
laid
him
down
on
the
ground
to
bleed
i
say
ground
because
it
was
ground
hard
packed
and
no
boards
well
next
i
took
an
old
sack
and
put
a
lot
of
big
rocks
in
it
all
i
could
drag
and
i
started
it
from
the
pig
and
dragged
it
to
the
door
and
through
the
woods
down
to
the
river
and
dumped
it
in
and
down
it
sunk
out
of
sight
you
could
easy
see
that
something
had
been
dragged
over
the
ground
i
did
wish
tom
sawyer
was
there
i
knowed
he
would
take
an
interest
in
this
kind
of
business
and
throw
in
the
fancy
touches
nobody
could
spread
himself
like
tom
sawyer
in
such
a
thing
as
that
well
last
i
pulled
out
some
of
my
hair
and
blooded
the
ax
good
and
stuck
it
on
the
back
side
and
slung
the
ax
in
the
corner
then
i
took
up
the
pig
and
held
him
to
my
breast
with
my
jacket
so
he
drip
till
i
got
a
good
piece
below
the
house
and
then
dumped
him
into
the
river
now
i
thought
of
something
else
so
i
went
and
got
the
bag
of
meal
and
my
old
saw
out
of
the
canoe
and
fetched
them
to
the
house
i
took
the
bag
to
where
it
used
to
stand
and
ripped
a
hole
in
the
bottom
of
it
with
the
saw
for
there
war
no
knives
and
forks
on
the
place
pap
done
everything
with
his
about
the
cooking
then
i
carried
the
sack
about
a
hundred
yards
across
the
grass
and
through
the
willows
east
of
the
house
to
a
shallow
lake
that
was
five
mile
wide
and
full
of
rushes
and
ducks
too
you
might
say
in
the
season
there
was
a
slough
or
a
creek
leading
out
of
it
on
the
other
side
that
went
miles
away
i
do
know
where
but
it
did
go
to
the
river
the
meal
sifted
out
and
made
a
little
track
all
the
way
to
the
lake
i
dropped
pap
whetstone
there
too
so
as
to
look
like
it
had
been
done
by
accident
then
i
tied
up
the
rip
in
the
with
a
string
so
it
would
leak
no
more
and
took
it
and
my
saw
to
the
canoe
again
it
was
about
dark
now
so
i
dropped
the
canoe
down
the
river
under
some
willows
that
hung
over
the
bank
and
waited
for
the
moon
to
rise
i
made
fast
to
a
willow
then
i
took
a
bite
to
eat
and
by
and
by
laid
down
in
the
canoe
to
smoke
a
pipe
and
lay
out
a
plan
i
says
to
myself
they
follow
the
track
of
that
sackful
of
rocks
to
the
shore
and
then
drag
the
river
for
me
and
they
follow
that
meal
track
to
the
lake
and
go
browsing
down
the
creek
that
leads
out
of
it
to
find
the
robbers
that
killed
me
and
took
the
things
they
wo
ever
hunt
the
river
for
anything
but
my
dead
carcass
they
soon
get
tired
of
that
and
wo
bother
no
more
about
me
all
right
i
can
stop
anywhere
i
want
to
jackson
island
is
good
enough
for
me
i
know
that
island
pretty
well
and
nobody
ever
comes
there
and
then
i
can
paddle
over
to
town
nights
and
slink
around
and
pick
up
things
i
want
jackson
island
the
place
i
was
pretty
tired
and
the
first
thing
i
knowed
i
was
asleep
when
i
woke
up
i
did
know
where
i
was
for
a
minute
i
set
up
and
looked
around
a
little
scared
then
i
remembered
the
river
looked
miles
and
miles
across
the
moon
was
so
bright
i
could
counted
the
that
went
along
black
and
still
hundreds
of
yards
out
from
shore
everything
was
dead
quiet
and
it
looked
late
and
late
you
know
what
i
mean
i
do
know
the
words
to
put
it
in
i
took
a
good
gap
and
a
stretch
and
was
just
going
to
unhitch
and
start
when
i
heard
a
sound
away
over
the
water
i
listened
pretty
soon
i
made
it
out
it
was
that
dull
kind
of
a
regular
sound
that
comes
from
oars
working
in
rowlocks
when
it
a
still
night
i
peeped
out
through
the
willow
branches
and
there
it
was
a
skiff
away
across
the
water
i
could
tell
how
many
was
in
it
it
kept
and
when
it
was
abreast
of
me
i
see
there
war
but
one
man
in
it
thinks
i
maybe
it
pap
though
i
war
expecting
him
he
dropped
below
me
with
the
current
and
by
and
by
he
came
up
shore
in
the
easy
water
and
he
went
by
so
close
i
could
reached
out
the
gun
and
touched
him
well
it
pap
sure
enough
and
sober
too
by
the
way
he
laid
his
oars
i
did
lose
no
time
the
next
minute
i
was
soft
but
quick
in
the
shade
of
the
bank
i
made
two
mile
and
a
half
and
then
struck
out
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
more
toward
the
middle
of
the
river
because
pretty
soon
i
would
be
passing
the
and
people
might
see
me
and
hail
me
i
got
out
amongst
the
driftwood
and
then
laid
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
and
let
her
float
i
laid
there
and
had
a
good
rest
and
a
smoke
out
of
my
pipe
looking
away
into
the
sky
not
a
cloud
in
it
the
sky
looks
ever
so
deep
when
you
lay
down
on
your
back
in
the
moonshine
i
never
knowed
it
before
and
how
far
a
body
can
hear
on
the
water
such
nights
i
heard
people
talking
at
the
i
heard
what
they
said
too
every
word
of
it
one
man
said
it
was
getting
towards
the
long
days
and
the
short
nights
now
one
said
war
one
of
the
short
ones
he
reckoned
and
then
they
laughed
and
he
said
it
over
again
and
they
laughed
again
then
they
waked
up
another
fellow
and
told
him
and
laughed
but
he
did
laugh
he
ripped
out
something
brisk
and
said
let
him
alone
the
first
fellow
said
he
to
tell
it
to
his
old
woman
she
would
think
it
was
pretty
good
but
he
said
that
nothing
to
some
things
he
had
said
in
his
time
i
heard
one
man
say
it
was
nearly
three
and
he
hoped
daylight
would
wait
more
than
about
a
week
longer
after
that
the
talk
got
further
and
further
away
and
i
could
make
out
the
words
any
more
but
i
could
hear
the
mumble
and
now
and
then
a
laugh
too
but
it
seemed
a
long
ways
off
i
was
away
below
the
ferry
now
i
rose
up
and
there
was
island
about
two
mile
and
a
half
and
standing
up
out
of
the
middle
of
the
river
big
and
dark
and
solid
like
a
steamboat
without
any
lights
there
war
any
signs
of
the
bar
at
the
head
it
was
all
under
water
now
it
did
take
me
long
to
get
there
i
shot
past
the
head
at
a
ripping
rate
the
current
was
so
swift
and
then
i
got
into
the
dead
water
and
landed
on
the
side
towards
the
illinois
shore
i
run
the
canoe
into
a
deep
dent
in
the
bank
that
i
knowed
about
i
had
to
part
the
willow
branches
to
get
in
and
when
i
made
fast
nobody
could
seen
the
canoe
from
the
outside
i
went
up
and
set
down
on
a
log
at
the
head
of
the
island
and
looked
out
on
the
big
river
and
the
black
driftwood
and
away
over
to
the
town
three
mile
away
where
there
was
three
or
four
lights
twinkling
a
monstrous
big
was
about
a
mile
upstream
coming
along
down
with
a
lantern
in
the
middle
of
it
i
watched
it
come
creeping
down
and
when
it
was
most
abreast
of
where
i
stood
i
heard
a
man
say
stern
oars
there
heave
her
head
to
stabboard
i
heard
that
just
as
plain
as
if
the
man
was
by
my
side
there
was
a
little
gray
in
the
sky
now
so
i
stepped
into
the
woods
and
laid
down
for
a
nap
before
breakfast
chapter
viii
the
sun
was
up
so
high
when
i
waked
that
i
judged
it
was
after
eight
i
laid
there
in
the
grass
and
the
cool
shade
thinking
about
things
and
feeling
rested
and
ruther
comfortable
and
satisfied
i
could
see
the
sun
out
at
one
or
two
holes
but
mostly
it
was
big
trees
all
about
and
gloomy
in
there
amongst
them
there
was
freckled
places
on
the
ground
where
the
light
sifted
down
through
the
leaves
and
the
freckled
places
swapped
about
a
little
showing
there
was
a
little
breeze
up
there
a
couple
of
squirrels
set
on
a
limb
and
jabbered
at
me
very
friendly
i
was
powerful
lazy
and
comfortable
did
want
to
get
up
and
cook
breakfast
well
i
was
dozing
off
again
when
i
thinks
i
hears
a
deep
sound
of
boom
away
up
the
river
i
rouses
up
and
rests
on
my
elbow
and
listens
pretty
soon
i
hears
it
again
i
hopped
up
and
went
and
looked
out
at
a
hole
in
the
leaves
and
i
see
a
bunch
of
smoke
laying
on
the
water
a
long
ways
up
about
abreast
the
ferry
and
there
was
the
ferryboat
full
of
people
floating
along
down
i
knowed
what
was
the
matter
now
boom
i
see
the
white
smoke
squirt
out
of
the
ferryboat
side
you
see
they
was
firing
cannon
over
the
water
trying
to
make
my
carcass
come
to
the
top
i
was
pretty
hungry
but
it
war
going
to
do
for
me
to
start
a
fire
because
they
might
see
the
smoke
so
i
set
there
and
watched
the
and
listened
to
the
boom
the
river
was
a
mile
wide
there
and
it
always
looks
pretty
on
a
summer
morning
so
i
was
having
a
good
enough
time
seeing
them
hunt
for
my
remainders
if
i
only
had
a
bite
to
eat
well
then
i
happened
to
think
how
they
always
put
quicksilver
in
loaves
of
bread
and
float
them
off
because
they
always
go
right
to
the
drownded
carcass
and
stop
there
so
says
i
i
keep
a
lookout
and
if
any
of
them
floating
around
after
me
i
give
them
a
show
i
changed
to
the
illinois
edge
of
the
island
to
see
what
luck
i
could
have
and
i
war
disappointed
a
big
double
loaf
come
along
and
i
most
got
it
with
a
long
stick
but
my
foot
slipped
and
she
floated
out
further
of
course
i
was
where
the
current
set
in
the
closest
to
the
shore
i
knowed
enough
for
that
but
by
and
by
along
comes
another
one
and
this
time
i
won
i
took
out
the
plug
and
shook
out
the
little
dab
of
quicksilver
and
set
my
teeth
in
it
was
baker
bread
what
the
quality
eat
none
of
your
i
got
a
good
place
amongst
the
leaves
and
set
there
on
a
log
munching
the
bread
and
watching
the
and
very
well
satisfied
and
then
something
struck
me
i
says
now
i
reckon
the
widow
or
the
parson
or
somebody
prayed
that
this
bread
would
find
me
and
here
it
has
gone
and
done
it
so
there
ai
no
doubt
but
there
is
something
in
that
thing
that
is
there
something
in
it
when
a
body
like
the
widow
or
the
parson
prays
but
it
do
work
for
me
and
i
reckon
it
do
work
for
only
just
the
right
kind
i
lit
a
pipe
and
had
a
good
long
smoke
and
went
on
watching
the
ferryboat
was
floating
with
the
current
and
i
allowed
i
have
a
chance
to
see
who
was
aboard
when
she
come
along
because
she
would
come
in
close
where
the
bread
did
when
she
got
pretty
well
along
down
towards
me
i
put
out
my
pipe
and
went
to
where
i
fished
out
the
bread
and
laid
down
behind
a
log
on
the
bank
in
a
little
open
place
where
the
log
forked
i
could
peep
through
by
and
by
she
come
along
and
she
drifted
in
so
close
that
they
could
run
out
a
plank
and
walked
ashore
most
everybody
was
on
the
boat
pap
and
judge
thatcher
and
bessie
thatcher
and
joe
harper
and
tom
sawyer
and
his
old
aunt
polly
and
sid
and
mary
and
plenty
more
everybody
was
talking
about
the
murder
but
the
captain
broke
in
and
says
look
sharp
now
the
current
sets
in
the
closest
here
and
maybe
washed
ashore
and
got
tangled
amongst
the
brush
at
the
water
edge
i
hope
so
anyway
i
did
hope
so
they
all
crowded
up
and
leaned
over
the
rails
nearly
in
my
face
and
kept
still
watching
with
all
their
might
i
could
see
them
but
they
could
see
me
then
the
captain
sung
out
stand
away
and
the
cannon
let
off
such
a
blast
right
before
me
that
it
made
me
deef
with
the
noise
and
pretty
near
blind
with
the
smoke
and
i
judged
i
was
gone
if
they
had
some
bullets
in
i
reckon
they
got
the
corpse
they
was
after
well
i
see
i
war
hurt
thanks
to
goodness
the
boat
floated
on
and
went
out
of
sight
around
the
shoulder
of
the
island
i
could
hear
the
booming
now
and
then
further
and
further
off
and
by
and
by
after
an
hour
i
did
hear
it
no
more
the
island
was
three
mile
long
i
judged
they
had
got
to
the
foot
and
was
giving
it
up
but
they
yet
awhile
they
turned
around
the
foot
of
the
island
and
started
up
the
channel
on
the
missouri
side
under
steam
and
booming
once
in
a
while
as
they
went
i
crossed
over
to
that
side
and
watched
them
when
they
got
abreast
the
head
of
the
island
they
quit
shooting
and
dropped
over
to
the
missouri
shore
and
went
home
to
the
town
i
knowed
i
was
all
right
now
nobody
else
would
come
after
me
i
got
my
traps
out
of
the
canoe
and
made
me
a
nice
camp
in
the
thick
woods
i
made
a
kind
of
a
tent
out
of
my
blankets
to
put
my
things
under
so
the
rain
could
get
at
them
i
catched
a
catfish
and
haggled
him
open
with
my
saw
and
towards
sundown
i
started
my
and
had
supper
then
i
set
out
a
line
to
catch
some
fish
for
breakfast
when
it
was
dark
i
set
by
my
smoking
and
feeling
pretty
well
satisfied
but
by
and
by
it
got
sort
of
lonesome
and
so
i
went
and
set
on
the
bank
and
listened
to
the
current
swashing
along
and
counted
the
stars
and
and
rafts
that
come
down
and
then
went
to
bed
there
ai
no
better
way
to
put
in
time
when
you
are
lonesome
you
ca
stay
so
you
soon
get
over
it
and
so
for
three
days
and
nights
no
difference
just
the
same
thing
but
the
next
day
i
went
exploring
around
down
through
the
island
i
was
boss
of
it
it
all
belonged
to
me
so
to
say
and
i
wanted
to
know
all
about
it
but
mainly
i
wanted
to
put
in
the
time
i
found
plenty
strawberries
ripe
and
prime
and
green
summer
grapes
and
green
razberries
and
the
green
blackberries
was
just
beginning
to
show
they
would
all
come
handy
by
and
by
i
judged
well
i
went
fooling
along
in
the
deep
woods
till
i
judged
i
far
from
the
foot
of
the
island
i
had
my
gun
along
but
i
had
shot
nothing
it
was
for
protection
thought
i
would
kill
some
game
nigh
home
about
this
time
i
mighty
near
stepped
on
a
snake
and
it
went
sliding
off
through
the
grass
and
flowers
and
i
after
it
trying
to
get
a
shot
at
it
i
clipped
along
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
bounded
right
on
to
the
ashes
of
a
that
was
still
smoking
my
heart
jumped
up
amongst
my
lungs
i
never
waited
for
to
look
further
but
uncocked
my
gun
and
went
sneaking
back
on
my
tiptoes
as
fast
as
ever
i
could
every
now
and
then
i
stopped
a
second
amongst
the
thick
leaves
and
listened
but
my
breath
come
so
hard
i
hear
nothing
else
i
slunk
along
another
piece
further
then
listened
again
and
so
on
and
so
on
if
i
see
a
stump
i
took
it
for
a
man
if
i
trod
on
a
stick
and
broke
it
it
made
me
feel
like
a
person
had
cut
one
of
my
breaths
in
two
and
i
only
got
half
and
the
short
half
too
when
i
got
to
camp
i
war
feeling
very
brash
there
war
much
sand
in
my
craw
but
i
says
this
ai
no
time
to
be
fooling
around
so
i
got
all
my
traps
into
my
canoe
again
so
as
to
have
them
out
of
sight
and
i
put
out
the
fire
and
scattered
the
ashes
around
to
look
like
an
old
camp
and
then
clumb
a
tree
i
reckon
i
was
up
in
the
tree
two
hours
but
i
did
see
nothing
i
did
hear
nothing
i
only
i
heard
and
seen
as
much
as
a
thousand
things
well
i
could
stay
up
there
forever
so
at
last
i
got
down
but
i
kept
in
the
thick
woods
and
on
the
lookout
all
the
time
all
i
could
get
to
eat
was
berries
and
what
was
left
over
from
breakfast
by
the
time
it
was
night
i
was
pretty
hungry
so
when
it
was
good
and
dark
i
slid
out
from
shore
before
moonrise
and
paddled
over
to
the
illinois
bank
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
i
went
out
in
the
woods
and
cooked
a
supper
and
i
had
about
made
up
my
mind
i
would
stay
there
all
night
when
i
hear
a
and
says
to
myself
horses
coming
and
next
i
hear
people
voices
i
got
everything
into
the
canoe
as
quick
as
i
could
and
then
went
creeping
through
the
woods
to
see
what
i
could
find
out
i
had
got
far
when
i
hear
a
man
say
we
better
camp
here
if
we
can
find
a
good
place
the
horses
is
about
beat
out
let
look
around
i
did
wait
but
shoved
out
and
paddled
away
easy
i
tied
up
in
the
old
place
and
reckoned
i
would
sleep
in
the
canoe
i
did
sleep
much
i
could
somehow
for
thinking
and
every
time
i
waked
up
i
thought
somebody
had
me
by
the
neck
so
the
sleep
do
me
no
good
by
and
by
i
says
to
myself
i
ca
live
this
way
to
find
out
who
it
is
that
here
on
the
island
with
me
find
it
out
or
bust
well
i
felt
better
right
off
so
i
took
my
paddle
and
slid
out
from
shore
just
a
step
or
two
and
then
let
the
canoe
drop
along
down
amongst
the
shadows
the
moon
was
shining
and
outside
of
the
shadows
it
made
it
most
as
light
as
day
i
poked
along
well
on
to
an
hour
everything
still
as
rocks
and
sound
asleep
well
by
this
time
i
was
most
down
to
the
foot
of
the
island
a
little
ripply
cool
breeze
begun
to
blow
and
that
was
as
good
as
saying
the
night
was
about
done
i
give
her
a
turn
with
the
paddle
and
brung
her
nose
to
shore
then
i
got
my
gun
and
slipped
out
and
into
the
edge
of
the
woods
i
sat
down
there
on
a
log
and
looked
out
through
the
leaves
i
see
the
moon
go
off
watch
and
the
darkness
begin
to
blanket
the
river
but
in
a
little
while
i
see
a
pale
streak
over
the
treetops
and
knowed
the
day
was
coming
so
i
took
my
gun
and
slipped
off
towards
where
i
had
run
across
that
stopping
every
minute
or
two
to
listen
but
i
had
no
luck
somehow
i
could
seem
to
find
the
place
but
by
and
by
sure
enough
i
catched
a
glimpse
of
fire
away
through
the
trees
i
went
for
it
cautious
and
slow
by
and
by
i
was
close
enough
to
have
a
look
and
there
laid
a
man
on
the
ground
it
most
give
me
the
fantods
he
had
a
blanket
around
his
head
and
his
head
was
nearly
in
the
fire
i
set
there
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
in
about
six
foot
of
him
and
kept
my
eyes
on
him
steady
it
was
getting
gray
daylight
now
pretty
soon
he
gapped
and
stretched
himself
and
hove
off
the
blanket
and
it
was
miss
watson
jim
i
bet
i
was
glad
to
see
him
i
says
hello
jim
and
skipped
out
he
bounced
up
and
stared
at
me
wild
then
he
drops
down
on
his
knees
and
puts
his
hands
together
and
says

sign
it
was
going
to
rain
he
said
it
was
a

way
when

of

you

because
that
would
bring
bad
luck
the
same
if

he
said
if
a
man
owned
a
beehive

died
the
bees

the
bees

chapter
ix
i
wanted
to
go
and
look
at
a
place
right
about
the
middle
of
the
island
that
i
found
when
i
was
exploring
so
we
started
and
soon
got
to
it
because
the
island
was
only
three
miles
long
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
this
place
was
a
tolerable
long
steep
hill
or
ridge
about
forty
foot
high
we
had
a
rough
time
getting
to
the
top
the
sides
was
so
steep
and
the
bushes
so
thick
we
tramped
and
clumb
around
all
over
it
and
by
and
by
found
a
good
big
cavern
in
the
rock
most
up
to
the
top
on
the
side
towards
illinois
the
cavern
was
as
big
as
two
or
three
rooms
bunched
together
and
jim
could
stand
up
straight
in
it
it
was
cool
in
there
jim
was
for
putting
our
traps
in
there
right
away
but
i
said
we
did
want
to
be
climbing
up
and
down
there
all
the
time
jim
said
if
we
had
the
canoe
hid
in
a
good
place
and
had
all
the
traps
in
the
cavern
we
could
rush
there
if
anybody
was
to
come
to
the
island
and
they
would
never
find
us
without
dogs
and
besides
he
said
them
little
birds
had
said
it
was
going
to
rain
and
did
i
want
the
things
to
get
wet
so
we
went
back
and
got
the
canoe
and
paddled
up
abreast
the
cavern
and
lugged
all
the
traps
up
there
then
we
hunted
up
a
place
close
by
to
hide
the
canoe
in
amongst
the
thick
willows
we
took
some
fish
off
of
the
lines
and
set
them
again
and
begun
to
get
ready
for
dinner
the
door
of
the
cavern
was
big
enough
to
roll
a
hogshead
in
and
on
one
side
of
the
door
the
floor
stuck
out
a
little
bit
and
was
flat
and
a
good
place
to
build
a
fire
on
so
we
built
it
there
and
cooked
dinner
we
spread
the
blankets
inside
for
a
carpet
and
eat
our
dinner
in
there
we
put
all
the
other
things
handy
at
the
back
of
the
cavern
pretty
soon
it
darkened
up
and
begun
to
thunder
and
lighten
so
the
birds
was
right
about
it
directly
it
begun
to
rain
and
it
rained
like
all
fury
too
and
i
never
see
the
wind
blow
so
it
was
one
of
these
regular
summer
storms
it
would
get
so
dark
that
it
looked
all
outside
and
lovely
and
the
rain
would
thrash
along
by
so
thick
that
the
trees
off
a
little
ways
looked
dim
and
and
here
would
come
a
blast
of
wind
that
would
bend
the
trees
down
and
turn
up
the
pale
underside
of
the
leaves
and
then
a
perfect
ripper
of
a
gust
would
follow
along
and
set
the
branches
to
tossing
their
arms
as
if
they
was
just
wild
and
next
when
it
was
just
about
the
bluest
and
blackest
it
was
as
bright
as
glory
and
you
have
a
little
glimpse
of
about
away
off
yonder
in
the
storm
hundreds
of
yards
further
than
you
could
see
before
dark
as
sin
again
in
a
second
and
now
you
hear
the
thunder
let
go
with
an
awful
crash
and
then
go
rumbling
grumbling
tumbling
down
the
sky
towards
the
under
side
of
the
world
like
rolling
empty
barrels
where
it
long
stairs
and
they
bounce
a
good
deal
you
know
jim
this
is
nice
i
says
i
would
want
to
be
nowhere
else
but
here
pass
me
along
another
hunk
of
fish
and
some
hot

chile
the
river
went
on
raising
and
raising
for
ten
or
twelve
days
till
at
last
it
was
over
the
banks
the
water
was
three
or
four
foot
deep
on
the
island
in
the
low
places
and
on
the
illinois
bottom
on
that
side
it
was
a
good
many
miles
wide
but
on
the
missouri
side
it
was
the
same
old
distance
across
a
half
a
mile
because
the
missouri
shore
was
just
a
wall
of
high
bluffs
daytimes
we
paddled
all
over
the
island
in
the
canoe
it
was
mighty
cool
and
shady
in
the
deep
woods
even
if
the
sun
was
blazing
outside
we
went
winding
in
and
out
amongst
the
trees
and
sometimes
the
vines
hung
so
thick
we
had
to
back
away
and
go
some
other
way
well
on
every
old
tree
you
could
see
rabbits
and
snakes
and
such
things
and
when
the
island
had
been
overflowed
a
day
or
two
they
got
so
tame
on
account
of
being
hungry
that
you
could
paddle
right
up
and
put
your
hand
on
them
if
you
wanted
to
but
not
the
snakes
and
turtles
they
would
slide
off
in
the
water
the
ridge
our
cavern
was
in
was
full
of
them
we
could
had
pets
enough
if
we
wanted
them
one
night
we
catched
a
little
section
of
a
nice
pine
planks
it
was
twelve
foot
wide
and
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
foot
long
and
the
top
stood
above
water
six
or
seven
inches
a
solid
level
floor
we
could
see
go
by
in
the
daylight
sometimes
but
we
let
them
go
we
did
show
ourselves
in
daylight
another
night
when
we
was
up
at
the
head
of
the
island
just
before
daylight
here
comes
a
down
on
the
west
side
she
was
a
and
tilted
over
considerable
we
paddled
out
and
got
aboard
clumb
in
at
an
window
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
yet
so
we
made
the
canoe
fast
and
set
in
her
to
wait
for
daylight
the
light
begun
to
come
before
we
got
to
the
foot
of
the
island
then
we
looked
in
at
the
window
we
could
make
out
a
bed
and
a
table
and
two
old
chairs
and
lots
of
things
around
about
on
the
floor
and
there
was
clothes
hanging
against
the
wall
there
was
something
laying
on
the
floor
in
the
far
corner
that
looked
like
a
man
so
jim
says
hello
you
but
it
did
budge
so
i
hollered
again
and
then
jim
says
de
man
ai
asleep
he
dead
you
hold
still
i
go
en
see
he
went
and
bent
down
and
looked
and
says
it
a
dead
man
yes
indeedy
naked
too
he
ben
shot
in
de
back
i
he
ben
dead
two
er
three
days
come
in
huck
but
look
at
his
face
it
too
gashly
i
did
look
at
him
at
all
jim
throwed
some
old
rags
over
him
but
he
need
done
it
i
did
want
to
see
him
there
was
heaps
of
old
greasy
cards
scattered
around
over
the
floor
and
old
and
a
couple
of
masks
made
out
of
black
cloth
and
all
over
the
walls
was
the
ignorantest
kind
of
words
and
pictures
made
with
charcoal
there
was
two
old
dirty
calico
dresses
and
a
and
some
women
underclothes
hanging
against
the
wall
and
some
clothing
too
we
put
the
lot
into
the
canoe
it
might
come
good
there
was
a
boy
old
speckled
straw
hat
on
the
floor
i
took
that
too
and
there
was
a
bottle
that
had
had
milk
in
it
and
it
had
a
rag
stopper
for
a
baby
to
suck
we
would
took
the
bottle
but
it
was
broke
there
was
a
seedy
old
chest
and
an
old
hair
trunk
with
the
hinges
broke
they
stood
open
but
there
war
nothing
left
in
them
that
was
any
account
the
way
things
was
scattered
about
we
reckoned
the
people
left
in
a
hurry
and
war
fixed
so
as
to
carry
off
most
of
their
stuff
we
got
an
old
tin
lantern
and
a
without
any
handle
and
a
barlow
knife
worth
two
bits
in
any
store
and
a
lot
of
tallow
candles
and
a
tin
candlestick
and
a
gourd
and
a
tin
cup
and
a
ratty
old
bedquilt
off
the
bed
and
a
reticule
with
needles
and
pins
and
beeswax
and
buttons
and
thread
and
all
such
truck
in
it
and
a
hatchet
and
some
nails
and
a
as
thick
as
my
little
finger
with
some
monstrous
hooks
on
it
and
a
roll
of
buckskin
and
a
leather
and
a
horseshoe
and
some
vials
of
medicine
that
have
no
label
on
them
and
just
as
we
was
leaving
i
found
a
tolerable
good
currycomb
and
jim
he
found
a
ratty
old
and
a
wooden
leg
the
straps
was
broke
off
of
it
but
barring
that
it
was
a
good
enough
leg
though
it
was
too
long
for
me
and
not
long
enough
for
jim
and
we
could
find
the
other
one
though
we
hunted
all
around
and
so
take
it
all
around
we
made
a
good
haul
when
we
was
ready
to
shove
off
we
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
the
island
and
it
was
pretty
broad
day
so
i
made
jim
lay
down
in
the
canoe
and
cover
up
with
the
quilt
because
if
he
set
up
people
could
tell
he
was
a
nigger
a
good
ways
off
i
paddled
over
to
the
illinois
shore
and
drifted
down
most
a
half
a
mile
doing
it
i
crept
up
the
dead
water
under
the
bank
and
had
no
accidents
and
did
see
nobody
we
got
home
all
safe
chapter
x
after
breakfast
i
wanted
to
talk
about
the
dead
man
and
guess
out
how
he
come
to
be
killed
but
jim
did
want
to
he
said
it
would
fetch
bad
luck
and
besides
he
said
he
might
come
and
us
he
said
a
man
that
war
buried
was
more
likely
to
go
around
than
one
that
was
planted
and
comfortable
that
sounded
pretty
reasonable
so
i
did
say
no
more
but
i
could
keep
from
studying
over
it
and
wishing
i
knowed
who
shot
the
man
and
what
they
done
it
for
we
rummaged
the
clothes
we
got
and
found
eight
dollars
in
silver
sewed
up
in
the
lining
of
an
old
blanket
overcoat
jim
said
he
reckoned
the
people
in
that
house
stole
the
coat
because
if
knowed
the
money
was
there
they
would
left
it
i
said
i
reckoned
they
killed
him
too
but
jim
did
want
to
talk
about
that
i
says
now
you
think
it
bad
luck
but
what
did
you
say
when
i
fetched
in
the
that
i
found
on
the
top
of
the
ridge
day
before
yesterday
you
said
it
was
the
worst
bad
luck
in
the
world
to
touch
a
with
my
hands
well
here
your
bad
luck
we
raked
in
all
this
truck
and
eight
dollars
besides
i
wish
we
could
have
some
bad
luck
like
this
every
day
jim
never
you
mind
honey
never
you
mind
do
you
git
too
peart
mind
i
tell
you
it
it
did
come
too
it
was
a
tuesday
that
we
had
that
talk
well
after
dinner
friday
we
was
laying
around
in
the
grass
at
the
upper
end
of
the
ridge
and
got
out
of
tobacco
i
went
to
the
cavern
to
get
some
and
found
a
rattlesnake
in
there
i
killed
him
and
curled
him
up
on
the
foot
of
jim
blanket
ever
so
natural
thinking
there
be
some
fun
when
jim
found
him
there
well
by
night
i
forgot
all
about
the
snake
and
when
jim
flung
himself
down
on
the
blanket
while
i
struck
a
light
the
snake
mate
was
there
and
bit
him
he
jumped
up
yelling
and
the
first
thing
the
light
showed
was
the
varmint
curled
up
and
ready
for
another
spring
i
laid
him
out
in
a
second
with
a
stick
and
jim
grabbed
pap
and
begun
to
pour
it
down
he
was
barefooted
and
the
snake
bit
him
right
on
the
heel
that
all
comes
of
my
being
such
a
fool
as
to
not
remember
that
wherever
you
leave
a
dead
snake
its
mate
always
comes
there
and
curls
around
it
jim
told
me
to
chop
off
the
snake
head
and
throw
it
away
and
then
skin
the
body
and
roast
a
piece
of
it
i
done
it
and
he
eat
it
and
said
it
would
help
cure
him
he
made
me
take
off
the
rattles
and
tie
them
around
his
wrist
too
he
said
that
that
would
help
then
i
slid
out
quiet
and
throwed
the
snakes
clear
away
amongst
the
bushes
for
i
war
going
to
let
jim
find
out
it
was
all
my
fault
not
if
i
could
help
it
jim
sucked
and
sucked
at
the
jug
and
now
and
then
he
got
out
of
his
head
and
pitched
around
and
yelled
but
every
time
he
come
to
himself
he
went
to
sucking
at
the
jug
again
his
foot
swelled
up
pretty
big
and
so
did
his
leg
but
by
and
by
the
drunk
begun
to
come
and
so
i
judged
he
was
all
right
but
i
druther
been
bit
with
a
snake
than
pap
whisky
jim
was
laid
up
for
four
days
and
nights
then
the
swelling
was
all
gone
and
he
was
around
again
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
ever
take
of
a
again
with
my
hands
now
that
i
see
what
had
come
of
it
jim
said
he
reckoned
i
would
believe
him
next
time
and
he
said
that
handling
a
was
such
awful
bad
luck
that
maybe
we
had
got
to
the
end
of
it
yet
he
said
he
druther
see
the
new
moon
over
his
left
shoulder
as
much
as
a
thousand
times
than
take
up
a
in
his
hand
well
i
was
getting
to
feel
that
way
myself
though
i
always
reckoned
that
looking
at
the
new
moon
over
your
left
shoulder
is
one
of
the
carelessest
and
foolishest
things
a
body
can
do
old
hank
bunker
done
it
once
and
bragged
about
it
and
in
less
than
two
years
he
got
drunk
and
fell
off
of
the
and
spread
himself
out
so
that
he
was
just
a
kind
of
a
layer
as
you
may
say
and
they
slid
him
edgeways
between
two
barn
doors
for
a
coffin
and
buried
him
so
so
they
say
but
i
did
see
it
pap
told
me
but
anyway
it
all
come
of
looking
at
the
moon
that
way
like
a
fool
well
the
days
went
along
and
the
river
went
down
between
its
banks
again
and
about
the
first
thing
we
done
was
to
bait
one
of
the
big
hooks
with
a
skinned
rabbit
and
set
it
and
catch
a
catfish
that
was
as
big
as
a
man
being
six
foot
two
inches
long
and
weighed
over
two
hundred
pounds
we
could
handle
him
of
course
he
would
flung
us
into
illinois
we
just
set
there
and
watched
him
rip
and
tear
around
till
he
drownded
we
found
a
brass
button
in
his
stomach
and
a
round
ball
and
lots
of
rubbage
we
split
the
ball
open
with
the
hatchet
and
there
was
a
spool
in
it
jim
said
he
had
it
there
a
long
time
to
coat
it
over
so
and
make
a
ball
of
it
it
was
as
big
a
fish
as
was
ever
catched
in
the
mississippi
i
reckon
jim
said
he
had
ever
seen
a
bigger
one
he
would
been
worth
a
good
deal
over
at
the
village
they
peddle
out
such
a
fish
as
that
by
the
pound
in
the
there
everybody
buys
some
of
him
his
meat
as
white
as
snow
and
makes
a
good
fry
next
morning
i
said
it
was
getting
slow
and
dull
and
i
wanted
to
get
a
some
way
i
said
i
reckoned
i
would
slip
over
the
river
and
find
out
what
was
going
on
jim
liked
that
notion
but
he
said
i
must
go
in
the
dark
and
look
sharp
then
he
studied
it
over
and
said
could
i
put
on
some
of
them
old
things
and
dress
up
like
a
girl
that
was
a
good
notion
too
so
we
shortened
up
one
of
the
calico
gowns
and
i
turned
up
my
to
my
knees
and
got
into
it
jim
hitched
it
behind
with
the
hooks
and
it
was
a
fair
fit
i
put
on
the
and
tied
it
under
my
chin
and
then
for
a
body
to
look
in
and
see
my
face
was
like
looking
down
a
joint
of
jim
said
nobody
would
know
me
even
in
the
daytime
hardly
i
practised
around
all
day
to
get
the
hang
of
the
things
and
by
and
by
i
could
do
pretty
well
in
them
only
jim
said
i
did
walk
like
a
girl
and
he
said
i
must
quit
pulling
up
my
gown
to
get
at
my
i
took
notice
and
done
better
i
started
up
the
illinois
shore
in
the
canoe
just
after
dark
i
started
across
to
the
town
from
a
little
below
the
and
the
drift
of
the
current
fetched
me
in
at
the
bottom
of
the
town
i
tied
up
and
started
along
the
bank
there
was
a
light
burning
in
a
little
shanty
that
had
been
lived
in
for
a
long
time
and
i
wondered
who
had
took
up
quarters
there
i
slipped
up
and
peeped
in
at
the
window
there
was
a
woman
about
forty
year
old
in
there
knitting
by
a
candle
that
was
on
a
pine
table
i
did
know
her
face
she
was
a
stranger
for
you
could
start
a
face
in
that
town
that
i
know
now
this
was
lucky
because
i
was
weakening
i
was
getting
afraid
i
had
come
people
might
know
my
voice
and
find
me
out
but
if
this
woman
had
been
in
such
a
little
town
two
days
she
could
tell
me
all
i
wanted
to
know
so
i
knocked
at
the
door
and
made
up
my
mind
i
would
forget
i
was
a
girl
chapter
xi
come
in
says
the
woman
and
i
did
she
says
take
a
cheer
i
done
it
she
looked
me
all
over
with
her
little
shiny
eyes
and
says
what
might
your
name
be
sarah
williams
do
you
live
in
this
neighborhood
no
in
hookerville
seven
mile
below
i
walked
all
the
way
and
i
all
tired
out
hungry
too
i
reckon
i
find
you
something
no
i
ai
hungry
i
was
so
hungry
i
had
to
stop
two
miles
below
here
at
a
farm
so
i
ai
hungry
no
more
it
what
makes
me
so
late
my
mother
down
sick
and
out
of
money
and
everything
and
i
come
to
tell
my
uncle
abner
moore
he
lives
at
the
upper
end
of
the
town
she
says
i
hai
ever
been
here
before
do
you
know
him
no
but
i
do
know
everybody
yet
i
have
lived
here
quite
two
weeks
it
a
considerable
ways
to
the
upper
end
of
the
town
you
better
stay
here
all
night
take
off
your
bonnet
no
i
says
i
rest
awhile
i
reckon
and
go
on
i
ai
afeard
of
the
dark
she
said
she
would
let
me
go
by
myself
but
her
husband
would
be
in
by
and
by
maybe
in
a
hour
and
a
half
and
she
send
him
along
with
me
then
she
got
to
talking
about
her
husband
and
about
her
relations
up
the
river
and
her
relations
down
the
river
and
about
how
much
better
off
they
used
to
was
and
how
they
did
know
but
they
made
a
mistake
coming
to
our
town
instead
of
letting
well
alone
and
so
on
and
so
on
till
i
was
afeard
i
had
made
a
mistake
coming
to
her
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
in
the
town
but
by
and
by
she
dropped
on
to
pap
and
the
murder
and
then
i
was
pretty
willing
to
let
her
clatter
right
along
she
told
about
me
and
tom
sawyer
finding
the
twelve
thousand
dollars
only
she
got
it
twenty
and
all
about
pap
and
what
a
hard
lot
he
was
and
what
a
hard
lot
i
was
and
at
last
she
got
down
to
where
i
was
murdered
i
says
who
done
it
we
heard
considerable
about
these
down
in
hookerville
but
we
do
know
who
was
that
killed
huck
finn
well
i
reckon
there
a
right
smart
chance
of
people
that
like
to
know
who
killed
him
some
think
old
finn
done
it
himself
no
is
that
so
most
everybody
thought
it
at
first
he
never
know
how
nigh
he
come
to
getting
lynched
but
before
night
they
changed
around
and
judged
it
was
done
by
a
runaway
nigger
named
jim
why
i
stopped
i
reckoned
i
better
keep
still
she
run
on
and
never
noticed
i
had
put
in
at
all
the
nigger
run
off
the
very
night
huck
finn
was
killed
so
there
a
reward
out
for
him
three
hundred
dollars
and
there
a
reward
out
for
old
finn
too
two
hundred
dollars
you
see
he
come
to
town
the
morning
after
the
murder
and
told
about
it
and
was
out
with
on
the
ferryboat
hunt
and
right
away
after
he
up
and
left
before
night
they
wanted
to
lynch
him
but
he
was
gone
you
see
well
next
day
they
found
out
the
nigger
was
gone
they
found
out
he
had
ben
seen
sence
ten
the
night
the
murder
was
done
so
then
they
put
it
on
him
you
see
and
while
they
was
full
of
it
next
day
back
comes
old
finn
and
went
to
judge
thatcher
to
get
money
to
hunt
for
the
nigger
all
over
illinois
with
the
judge
gave
him
some
and
that
evening
he
got
drunk
and
was
around
till
after
midnight
with
a
couple
of
mighty
strangers
and
then
went
off
with
them
well
he
hai
come
back
sence
and
they
ai
looking
for
him
back
till
this
thing
blows
over
a
little
for
people
thinks
now
that
he
killed
his
boy
and
fixed
things
so
folks
would
think
robbers
done
it
and
then
he
get
huck
money
without
having
to
bother
a
long
time
with
a
lawsuit
people
do
say
he
war
any
too
good
to
do
it
oh
he
sly
i
reckon
if
he
do
come
back
for
a
year
he
be
all
right
you
ca
prove
anything
on
him
you
know
everything
will
be
quieted
down
then
and
he
walk
in
huck
money
as
easy
as
nothing
yes
i
reckon
so
i
do
see
nothing
in
the
way
of
it
has
everybody
quit
thinking
the
nigger
done
it
oh
no
not
everybody
a
good
many
thinks
he
done
it
but
they
get
the
nigger
pretty
soon
now
and
maybe
they
can
scare
it
out
of
him
why
are
they
after
him
yet
well
you
innocent
ai
you
does
three
hundred
dollars
lay
around
every
day
for
people
to
pick
up
some
folks
think
the
nigger
ai
far
from
here
i
one
of
them
but
i
hai
talked
it
around
a
few
days
ago
i
was
talking
with
an
old
couple
that
lives
next
door
in
the
log
shanty
and
they
happened
to
say
hardly
anybody
ever
goes
to
that
island
over
yonder
that
they
call
jackson
island
do
anybody
live
there
says
i
no
nobody
says
they
i
did
say
any
more
but
i
done
some
thinking
i
was
pretty
near
certain
i
seen
smoke
over
there
about
the
head
of
the
island
a
day
or
two
before
that
so
i
says
to
myself
like
as
not
that
nigger
hiding
over
there
anyway
says
i
it
worth
the
trouble
to
give
the
place
a
hunt
i
hai
seen
any
smoke
sence
so
i
reckon
maybe
he
gone
if
it
was
him
but
husband
going
over
to
see
him
and
another
man
he
was
gone
up
the
river
but
he
got
back
and
i
told
him
as
soon
as
he
got
here
two
hours
ago
i
had
got
so
uneasy
i
could
set
still
i
had
to
do
something
with
my
hands
so
i
took
up
a
needle
off
of
the
table
and
went
to
threading
it
my
hands
shook
and
i
was
making
a
bad
job
of
it
when
the
woman
stopped
talking
i
looked
up
and
she
was
looking
at
me
pretty
curious
and
smiling
a
little
i
put
down
the
needle
and
thread
and
let
on
to
be
interested
and
i
was
too
and
says
three
hundred
dollars
is
a
power
of
money
i
wish
my
mother
could
get
it
is
your
husband
going
over
there
oh
yes
he
went
with
the
man
i
was
telling
you
of
to
get
a
boat
and
see
if
they
could
borrow
another
gun
they
go
over
after
midnight
could
they
see
better
if
they
was
to
wait
till
daytime
yes
and
could
the
nigger
see
better
too
after
midnight
likely
be
asleep
and
they
can
slip
around
through
the
woods
and
hunt
up
his
campfire
all
the
better
for
the
dark
if
he
got
one
i
did
think
of
that
the
woman
kept
looking
at
me
pretty
curious
and
i
did
feel
a
bit
comfortable
pretty
soon
she
says
what
did
you
say
your
name
was
honey
m
mary
williams
somehow
it
did
seem
to
me
that
i
said
it
was
mary
before
so
i
did
look
up
seemed
to
me
i
said
it
was
sarah
so
i
felt
sort
of
cornered
and
was
afeard
maybe
i
was
looking
it
too
i
wished
the
woman
would
say
something
more
the
longer
she
set
still
the
uneasier
i
was
but
now
she
says
honey
i
thought
you
said
it
was
sarah
when
you
first
come
in
oh
yes
i
did
sarah
mary
williams
sarah
my
first
name
some
calls
me
sarah
some
calls
me
mary
oh
that
the
way
of
it
yes
i
was
feeling
better
then
but
i
wished
i
was
out
of
there
anyway
i
could
look
up
yet
well
the
woman
fell
to
talking
about
how
hard
times
was
and
how
poor
they
had
to
live
and
how
the
rats
was
as
free
as
if
they
owned
the
place
and
so
forth
and
so
on
and
then
i
got
easy
again
she
was
right
about
the
rats
you
see
one
stick
his
nose
out
of
a
hole
in
the
corner
every
little
while
she
said
she
had
to
have
things
handy
to
throw
at
them
when
she
was
alone
or
they
would
give
her
no
peace
she
showed
me
a
bar
of
lead
twisted
up
into
a
knot
and
said
she
was
a
good
shot
with
it
generly
but
she
wrenched
her
arm
a
day
or
two
ago
and
did
know
whether
she
could
throw
true
now
but
she
watched
for
a
chance
and
directly
banged
away
at
a
rat
but
she
missed
him
wide
and
said
ouch
it
hurt
her
arm
so
then
she
told
me
to
try
for
the
next
one
i
wanted
to
be
getting
away
before
the
old
man
got
back
but
of
course
i
did
let
on
i
got
the
thing
and
the
first
rat
that
showed
his
nose
i
let
drive
and
if
he
stayed
where
he
was
he
been
a
tolerable
sick
rat
she
said
that
was
and
she
reckoned
i
would
hive
the
next
one
she
went
and
got
the
lump
of
lead
and
fetched
it
back
and
brought
along
a
hank
of
yarn
which
she
wanted
me
to
help
her
with
i
held
up
my
two
hands
and
she
put
the
hank
over
them
and
went
on
talking
about
her
and
her
husband
matters
but
she
broke
off
to
say
keep
your
eye
on
the
rats
you
better
have
the
lead
in
your
lap
handy
so
she
dropped
the
lump
into
my
lap
just
at
that
moment
and
i
clapped
my
legs
together
on
it
and
she
went
on
talking
but
only
about
a
minute
then
she
took
off
the
hank
and
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
and
very
pleasant
and
says
come
now
what
your
real
name
mum
what
your
real
name
is
it
bill
or
tom
or
bob
or
what
is
it
i
reckon
i
shook
like
a
leaf
and
i
did
know
hardly
what
to
do
but
i
says
please
to
do
poke
fun
at
a
poor
girl
like
me
mum
if
i
in
the
way
here
i
no
you
wo
set
down
and
stay
where
you
are
i
ai
going
to
hurt
you
and
i
ai
going
to
tell
on
you
nuther
you
just
tell
me
your
secret
and
trust
me
i
keep
it
and
what
more
i
help
you
so
my
old
man
if
you
want
him
to
you
see
you
a
runaway
that
all
it
ai
anything
there
ai
no
harm
in
it
you
been
treated
bad
and
you
made
up
your
mind
to
cut
bless
you
child
i
would
tell
on
you
tell
me
all
about
it
now
that
a
good
boy
so
i
said
it
would
be
no
use
to
try
to
play
it
any
longer
and
i
would
just
make
a
clean
breast
and
tell
her
everything
but
she
must
go
back
on
her
promise
then
i
told
her
my
father
and
mother
was
dead
and
the
law
had
bound
me
out
to
a
mean
old
farmer
in
the
country
thirty
mile
back
from
the
river
and
he
treated
me
so
bad
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
went
away
to
be
gone
a
couple
of
days
and
so
i
took
my
chance
and
stole
some
of
his
daughter
old
clothes
and
cleared
out
and
i
had
been
three
nights
coming
the
thirty
miles
i
traveled
nights
and
hid
daytimes
and
slept
and
the
bag
of
bread
and
meat
i
carried
from
home
lasted
me
all
the
way
and
i
had
i
said
i
believed
my
uncle
abner
moore
would
take
care
of
me
and
so
that
was
why
i
struck
out
for
this
town
of
goshen

ai
goshen
this
is
petersburg
ten
mile
further
up

daybreak
this
morning
just

regular
sleep

me

roads

right
hand

five
mile

the
thread
still
and
fetch
the
needle
up
to
it
hold
the
needle
still
and
poke
the
thread
at
it
that
the
way
a
woman
most
always
does
but
a
man
always
does
way
and
when
you
throw
at
a
rat
or
anything
hitch
yourself
up
and
fetch
your
hand
up
over
your
head
as
awkward
as
you
can
and
miss
your
rat
about
six
or
seven
foot
throw
from
the
shoulder
like
there
was
a
pivot
there
for
it
to
turn
on
like
a
girl
not
from
the
wrist
and
elbow
with
your
arm
out
to
one
side
like
a
boy
and
mind
you
when
a
girl
tries
to
catch
anything
in
her
lap
she
throws
her
knees
apart
she
do
clap
them
together
the
way
you
did
when
you
catched
the
lump
of
lead
why
i
spotted
you
for
a
boy
when
you
was
threading
the
needle
and
i
contrived
the
other
things
just
to
make
certain
now
trot
along
to
your
uncle
sarah
mary
williams
george
elexander
peters
and
if
you
get
into
trouble
you
send
word
to
judith
loftus
which
is
me
and
i
do
what
i
can
to
get
you
out
of
it
keep
the
river
road
all
the
way
and
next
time
you
tramp
take
shoes
and
socks
with
you
the
river
road
a
rocky
one
and
your
feet
be
in
a
condition
when
you
get
to
goshen
i
reckon
i
went
up
the
bank
about
fifty
yards
and
then
i
doubled
on
my
tracks
and
slipped
back
to
where
my
canoe
was
a
good
piece
below
the
house
i
jumped
in
and
was
off
in
a
hurry
i
went
far
enough
to
make
the
head
of
the
island
and
then
started
across
i
took
off
the
for
i
did
want
no
blinders
on
then
when
i
was
about
the
middle
i
heard
the
clock
begin
to
strike
so
i
stops
and
listens
the
sound
come
faint
over
the
water
but
clear
eleven
when
i
struck
the
head
of
the
island
i
never
waited
to
blow
though
i
was
most
winded
but
i
shoved
right
into
the
timber
where
my
old
camp
used
to
be
and
started
a
good
fire
there
on
a
high
and
dry
spot
then
i
jumped
in
the
canoe
and
dug
out
for
our
place
a
mile
and
a
half
below
as
hard
as
i
could
go
i
landed
and
slopped
through
the
timber
and
up
the
ridge
and
into
the
cavern
there
jim
laid
sound
asleep
on
the
ground
i
roused
him
out
and
says
git
up
and
hump
yourself
jim
there
ai
a
minute
to
lose
after
us
jim
never
asked
no
questions
he
never
said
a
word
but
the
way
he
worked
for
the
next
half
an
hour
showed
about
how
he
was
scared
by
that
time
everything
we
had
in
the
world
was
on
our
raft
and
she
was
ready
to
be
shoved
out
from
the
willow
cove
where
she
was
hid
we
put
out
the
at
the
cavern
the
first
thing
and
did
show
a
candle
outside
after
that
i
took
the
canoe
out
from
the
shore
a
little
piece
and
took
a
look
but
if
there
was
a
boat
around
i
could
see
it
for
stars
and
shadows
ai
good
to
see
by
then
we
got
out
the
raft
and
slipped
along
down
in
the
shade
past
the
foot
of
the
island
dead
still
never
saying
a
word
chapter
xii
it
must
been
close
on
to
one
when
we
got
below
the
island
at
last
and
the
raft
did
seem
to
go
mighty
slow
if
a
boat
was
to
come
along
we
was
going
to
take
to
the
canoe
and
break
for
the
illinois
shore
and
it
was
well
a
boat
did
come
for
we
had
ever
thought
to
put
the
gun
in
the
canoe
or
a
or
anything
to
eat
we
was
in
ruther
too
much
of
a
sweat
to
think
of
so
many
things
it
war
good
judgment
to
put
on
the
raft
if
the
men
went
to
the
island
i
just
expect
they
found
the
i
built
and
watched
it
all
night
for
jim
to
come
anyways
they
stayed
away
from
us
and
if
my
building
the
fire
never
fooled
them
it
no
fault
of
mine
i
played
it
as
low
down
on
them
as
i
could
when
the
first
streak
of
day
began
to
show
we
tied
up
to
a
towhead
in
a
big
bend
on
the
illinois
side
and
hacked
off
cottonwood
branches
with
the
hatchet
and
covered
up
the
raft
with
them
so
she
looked
like
there
had
been
a
in
the
bank
there
a
towhead
is
a
that
has
cottonwoods
on
it
as
thick
as
we
had
mountains
on
the
missouri
shore
and
heavy
timber
on
the
illinois
side
and
the
channel
was
down
the
missouri
shore
at
that
place
so
we
war
afraid
of
anybody
running
across
us
we
laid
there
all
day
and
watched
the
rafts
and
steamboats
spin
down
the
missouri
shore
and
steamboats
fight
the
big
river
in
the
middle
i
told
jim
all
about
the
time
i
had
jabbering
with
that
woman
and
jim
said
she
was
a
smart
one
and
if
she
was
to
start
after
us
herself
she
would
set
down
and
watch
a
no
sir
she
fetch
a
dog
well
then
i
said
why
could
she
tell
her
husband
to
fetch
a
dog
jim
said
he
bet
she
did
think
of
it
by
the
time
the
men
was
ready
to
start
and
he
believed
they
must
gone
to
get
a
dog
and
so
they
lost
all
that
time
or
else
we
would
be
here
on
a
towhead
sixteen
or
seventeen
mile
below
the
village
no
indeedy
we
would
be
in
that
same
old
town
again
so
i
said
i
did
care
what
was
the
reason
they
did
get
us
as
long
as
they
did
when
it
was
beginning
to
come
on
dark
we
poked
our
heads
out
of
the
cottonwood
thicket
and
looked
up
and
down
and
across
nothing
in
sight
so
jim
took
up
some
of
the
top
planks
of
the
raft
and
built
a
snug
wigwam
to
get
under
in
blazing
weather
and
rainy
and
to
keep
the
things
dry
jim
made
a
floor
for
the
wigwam
and
raised
it
a
foot
or
more
above
the
level
of
the
raft
so
now
the
blankets
and
all
the
traps
was
out
of
reach
of
steamboat
waves
right
in
the
middle
of
the
wigwam
we
made
a
layer
of
dirt
about
five
or
six
inches
deep
with
a
frame
around
it
for
to
hold
it
to
its
place
this
was
to
build
a
fire
on
in
sloppy
weather
or
chilly
the
wigwam
would
keep
it
from
being
seen
we
made
an
extra
too
because
one
of
the
others
might
get
broke
on
a
snag
or
something
we
fixed
up
a
short
forked
stick
to
hang
the
old
lantern
on
because
we
must
always
light
the
lantern
whenever
we
see
a
steamboat
coming
to
keep
from
getting
run
over
but
we
would
have
to
light
it
for
boats
unless
we
see
we
was
in
what
they
call
a
crossing
for
the
river
was
pretty
high
yet
very
low
banks
being
still
a
little
under
water
so
boats
did
always
run
the
channel
but
hunted
easy
water
this
second
night
we
run
between
seven
and
eight
hours
with
a
current
that
was
making
over
four
mile
an
hour
we
catched
fish
and
talked
and
we
took
a
swim
now
and
then
to
keep
off
sleepiness
it
was
kind
of
solemn
drifting
down
the
big
still
river
laying
on
our
backs
looking
up
at
the
stars
and
we
did
ever
feel
like
talking
loud
and
it
war
often
that
we
laughed
only
a
little
kind
of
a
low
chuckle
we
had
mighty
good
weather
as
a
general
thing
and
nothing
ever
happened
to
us
at
all
that
night
nor
the
next
nor
the
next
every
night
we
passed
towns
some
of
them
away
up
on
black
hillsides
nothing
but
just
a
shiny
bed
of
lights
not
a
house
could
you
see
the
fifth
night
we
passed
louis
and
it
was
like
the
whole
world
lit
up
in
petersburg
they
used
to
say
there
was
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
people
in
louis
but
i
never
believed
it
till
i
see
that
wonderful
spread
of
lights
at
two
that
still
night
there
war
a
sound
there
everybody
was
asleep
every
night
now
i
used
to
slip
ashore
toward
ten
at
some
little
village
and
buy
ten
or
fifteen
cents
worth
of
meal
or
bacon
or
other
stuff
to
eat
and
sometimes
i
lifted
a
chicken
that
roosting
comfortable
and
took
him
along
pap
always
said
take
a
chicken
when
you
get
a
chance
because
if
you
do
want
him
yourself
you
can
easy
find
somebody
that
does
and
a
good
deed
ai
ever
forgot
i
never
see
pap
when
he
did
want
the
chicken
himself
but
that
is
what
he
used
to
say
anyway
mornings
before
daylight
i
slipped
into
and
borrowed
a
watermelon
or
a
mushmelon
or
a
punkin
or
some
new
corn
or
things
of
that
kind
pap
always
said
it
war
no
harm
to
borrow
things
if
you
was
meaning
to
pay
them
back
some
time
but
the
widow
said
it
war
anything
but
a
soft
name
for
stealing
and
no
decent
body
would
do
it
jim
said
he
reckoned
the
widow
was
partly
right
and
pap
was
partly
right
so
the
best
way
would
be
for
us
to
pick
out
two
or
three
things
from
the
list
and
say
we
would
borrow
them
any
more
then
he
reckoned
it
would
be
no
harm
to
borrow
the
others
so
we
talked
it
over
all
one
night
drifting
along
down
the
river
trying
to
make
up
our
minds
whether
to
drop
the
watermelons
or
the
cantelopes
or
the
mushmelons
or
what
but
toward
daylight
we
got
it
all
settled
satisfactory
and
concluded
to
drop
crabapples
and
we
war
feeling
just
right
before
that
but
it
was
all
comfortable
now
i
was
glad
the
way
it
come
out
too
because
crabapples
ai
ever
good
and
the
would
be
ripe
for
two
or
three
months
yet
we
shot
a
now
and
then
that
got
up
too
early
in
the
morning
or
did
go
to
bed
early
enough
in
the
evening
take
it
all
round
we
lived
pretty
high
the
fifth
night
below
louis
we
had
a
big
storm
after
midnight
with
a
power
of
thunder
and
lightning
and
the
rain
poured
down
in
a
solid
sheet
we
stayed
in
the
wigwam
and
let
the
raft
take
care
of
itself
when
the
lightning
glared
out
we
could
see
a
big
straight
river
ahead
and
high
rocky
bluffs
on
both
sides
by
and
by
says
i
jim
looky
yonder
it
was
a
steamboat
that
had
killed
herself
on
a
rock
we
was
drifting
straight
down
for
her
the
lightning
showed
her
very
distinct
she
was
leaning
over
with
part
of
her
upper
deck
above
water
and
you
could
see
every
little
clean
and
clear
and
a
chair
by
the
big
bell
with
an
old
slouch
hat
hanging
on
the
back
of
it
when
the
flashes
come
well
it
being
away
in
the
night
and
stormy
and
all
so
i
felt
just
the
way
any
other
boy
would
felt
when
i
seen
that
wreck
laying
there
so
mournful
and
lonesome
in
the
middle
of
the
river
i
wanted
to
get
aboard
of
her
and
slink
around
a
little
and
see
what
there
was
there
so
i
says
le
land
on
her
jim
but
jim
was
dead
against
it
at
first
he
says
i
doan
want
to
go
er
no
wrack
we
doin
blame
well
en
we
better
let
blame
well
alone
as
de
good
book
says
like
as
not
dey
a
watchman
on
dat
wrack
watchman
your
grandmother
i
says
there
ai
nothing
to
watch
but
the
texas
and
the
and
do
you
reckon
anybody
going
to
resk
his
life
for
a
texas
and
a
such
a
night
as
this
when
it
likely
to
break
up
and
wash
off
down
the
river
any
minute
jim
could
say
nothing
to
that
so
he
did
try
and
besides
i
says
we
might
borrow
something
worth
having
out
of
the
stateroom
seegars
i
bet
you
and
cost
five
cents
apiece
solid
cash
steamboat
captains
is
always
rich
and
get
sixty
dollars
a
month
and
do
care
a
cent
what
a
thing
costs
you
know
long
as
they
want
it
stick
a
candle
in
your
pocket
i
ca
rest
jim
till
we
give
her
a
rummaging
do
you
reckon
tom
sawyer
would
ever
go
by
this
thing
not
for
pie
he
would
he
call
it
an
adventure
what
he
call
it
and
he
land
on
that
wreck
if
it
was
his
last
act
and
would
he
throw
style
into
it
would
he
spread
himself
nor
nothing
why
you
think
it
was
christopher
discovering
kingdom
come
i
wish
tom
sawyer
here
jim
he
grumbled
a
little
but
give
in
he
said
we
must
talk
any
more
than
we
could
help
and
then
talk
mighty
low
the
lightning
showed
us
the
wreck
again
just
in
time
and
we
fetched
the
stabboard
derrick
and
made
fast
there
the
deck
was
high
out
here
we
went
sneaking
down
the
slope
of
it
to
labboard
in
the
dark
towards
the
texas
feeling
our
way
slow
with
our
feet
and
spreading
our
hands
out
to
fend
off
the
guys
for
it
was
so
dark
we
could
see
no
sign
of
them
pretty
soon
we
struck
the
forward
end
of
the
skylight
and
clumb
on
to
it
and
the
next
step
fetched
us
in
front
of
the
captain
door
which
was
open
and
by
jimminy
away
down
through
the
we
see
a
light
and
all
in
the
same
second
we
seem
to
hear
low
voices
in
yonder
jim
whispered
and
said
he
was
feeling
powerful
sick
and
told
me
to
come
along
i
says
all
right
and
was
going
to
start
for
the
raft
but
just
then
i
heard
a
voice
wail
out
and
say
oh
please
do
boys
i
swear
i
wo
ever
tell
another
voice
said
pretty
loud
it
a
lie
jim
turner
you
acted
this
way
before
you
always
want
your
share
of
the
truck
and
you
always
got
it
too
because
you
swore
if
you
did
you
tell
but
this
time
you
said
it
jest
one
time
too
many
you

meanest
treacherousest
hound
in
this
country
by
this
time
jim
was
gone
for
the
raft
i
was
just
with
curiosity
and
i
says
to
myself
tom
sawyer
would
back
out
now
and
so
i
wo
either
i
to
see
what
going
on
here
so
i
dropped
on
my
hands
and
knees
in
the
little
passage
and
crept
aft
in
the
dark
till
there
war
but
one
stateroom
betwixt
me
and
the
of
the
texas
then
in
there
i
see
a
man
stretched
on
the
floor
and
tied
hand
and
foot
and
two
men
standing
over
him
and
one
of
them
had
a
dim
lantern
in
his
hand
and
the
other
one
had
a
pistol
this
one
kept
pointing
the
pistol
at
the
man
head
on
the
floor
and
saying
i
to

i
orter

mean
skunk
the
man
on
the
floor
would
shrivel
up
and
say

every
time

man
with
the
lantern

laugh
and
say

thing

reasons
for
it
bless
yo
heart
for
them
words
jake
packard
i
never
forgit
you
long
i
live
says
the
man
on
the
floor
sort
of
blubbering
packard
did
take
no
notice
of
that
but
hung
up
his
lantern
on
a
nail
and
started
toward
where
i
was
there
in
the
dark
and
motioned
bill
to
come
i
crawfished
as
fast
as
i
could
about
two
yards
but
the
boat
slanted
so
that
i
could
make
very
good
time
so
to
keep
from
getting
run
over
and
catched
i
crawled
into
a
stateroom
on
the
upper
side
the
man
came
along
in
the
dark
and
when
packard
got
to
my
stateroom
he
says
here
come
in
here
and
in
he
come
and
bill
after
him
but
before
they
got
in
i
was
up
in
the
upper
berth
cornered
and
sorry
i
come
then
they
stood
there
with
their
hands
on
the
ledge
of
the
berth
and
talked
i
could
see
them
but
i
could
tell
where
they
was
by
the
whisky
they
been
having
i
was
glad
i
did
drink
whisky
but
it
would
made
much
difference
anyway
because
most
of
the
time
they
could
treed
me
because
i
did
breathe
i
was
too
scared
and
besides
a
body
breathe
and
hear
such
talk
they
talked
low
and
earnest
bill
wanted
to
kill
turner
he
says
he
said
he
tell
and
he
will
if
we
was
to
give
both
our
shares
to
him
it
would
make
no
difference
after
the
row
and
the
way
we
served
him
shore
you
born
he
turn
state
evidence
now
you
hear
i
for
putting
him
out
of
his
troubles
so
i
says
packard
very
quiet
blame
it
i
sorter
begun
to
think
you
was
well
then
all
right
le
go
and
do
it
hold
on
a
minute
i
hai
had
my
say
yit
you
listen
to
me
shooting
good
but
there
quieter
ways
if
the
things
to
be
done
but
what
say
is
this
it
ai
good
sense
to
go
around
after
a
halter
if
you
can
git
at
what
you
up
to
in
some
way
that
jist
as
good
and
at
the
same
time
do
bring
you
into
no
resks
ai
that
so
you
bet
it
is
but
how
you
goin
to
manage
it
this
time
well
my
idea
is
this
we
rustle
around
and
gather
up
whatever
pickin
we
overlooked
in
the
staterooms
and
shove
for
shore
and
hide
the
truck
then
we
wait
now
i
say
it
ai
to
be
two
hours
befo
this
wrack
breaks
up
and
washes
off
down
the
river
see
he
be
drownded
and
wo
have
nobody
to
blame
for
it
but
his
own
self
i
reckon
that
a
considerable
sight
better
killin
of
him
i
unfavorable
to
killin
a
man
as
long
as
you
can
git
aroun
it
it
ai
good
sense
it
ai
good
morals
ai
i
right
yes
i
you
are
but
she
break
up
and
wash
off
well
we
can
wait
the
two
hours
anyway
and
see
ca
we
all
right
then
come
along
so
they
started
and
i
lit
out
all
in
a
cold
sweat
and
scrambled
forward
it
was
dark
as
pitch
there
but
i
said
in
a
kind
of
a
coarse
whisper
jim
and
he
answered
up
right
at
my
elbow
with
a
sort
of
a
moan
and
i
says
quick
jim
it
ai
no
time
for
fooling
around
and
moaning
a
gang
of
murderers
in
yonder
and
if
we
do
hunt
up
their
boat
and
set
her
drifting
down
the
river
so
these
fellows
ca
get
away
from
the
wreck
there
one
of
going
to
be
in
a
bad
fix
but
if
we
find
their
boat
we
can
put
of
in
a
bad
fix
for
the
sheriff
get
quick
hurry
i
hunt
the
labboard
side
you
hunt
the
stabboard
you
start
at
the
raft
and
oh
my
lordy
lordy
dey
ain
no
raf
no
mo
she
done
broke
loose
en
gone
en
here
we
is
chapter
xiii
well
i
catched
my
breath
and
most
fainted
shut
up
on
a
wreck
with
such
a
gang
as
that
but
it
war
no
time
to
be
sentimentering
to
find
that
boat
now
had
to
have
it
for
ourselves
so
we
went
and
shaking
down
the
stabboard
side
and
slow
work
it
was
too
seemed
a
week
before
we
got
to
the
stern
no
sign
of
a
boat
jim
said
he
did
believe
he
could
go
any
farther
so
scared
he
hardly
any
strength
left
he
said
but
i
said
come
on
if
we
get
left
on
this
wreck
we
are
in
a
fix
sure
so
on
we
prowled
again
we
struck
for
the
stern
of
the
texas
and
found
it
and
then
scrabbled
along
forwards
on
the
skylight
hanging
on
from
shutter
to
shutter
for
the
edge
of
the
skylight
was
in
the
water
when
we
got
pretty
close
to
the
door
there
was
the
skiff
sure
enough
i
could
just
barely
see
her
i
felt
ever
so
thankful
in
another
second
i
would
been
aboard
of
her
but
just
then
the
door
opened
one
of
the
men
stuck
his
head
out
only
about
a
couple
of
foot
from
me
and
i
thought
i
was
gone
but
he
jerked
it
in
again
and
says
heave
that
blame
lantern
out
o
sight
bill
he
flung
a
bag
of
something
into
the
boat
and
then
got
in
himself
and
set
down
it
was
packard
then
bill
come
out
and
got
in
packard
says
in
a
low
voice
all
ready
shove
off
i
could
hardly
hang
on
to
the
shutters
i
was
so
weak
but
bill
says
hold
on
you
go
through
him
no
did
you
no
so
he
got
his
share
o
the
cash
yet
well
then
come
along
no
use
to
take
truck
and
leave
money
say
wo
he
suspicion
what
we
up
to
maybe
he
wo
but
we
got
to
have
it
anyway
come
along
so
they
got
out
and
went
in
the
door
slammed
to
because
it
was
on
the
careened
side
and
in
a
half
second
i
was
in
the
boat
and
jim
come
tumbling
after
me
i
out
with
my
knife
and
cut
the
rope
and
away
we
went
we
did
touch
an
oar
and
we
did
speak
nor
whisper
nor
hardly
even
breathe
we
went
gliding
swift
along
dead
silent
past
the
tip
of
the
and
past
the
stern
then
in
a
second
or
two
more
we
was
a
hundred
yards
below
the
wreck
and
the
darkness
soaked
her
up
every
last
sign
of
her
and
we
was
safe
and
knowed
it
when
we
was
three
or
four
hundred
yards
we
see
the
lantern
show
like
a
little
spark
at
the
texas
door
for
a
second
and
we
knowed
by
that
that
the
rascals
had
missed
their
boat
and
was
beginning
to
understand
that
they
was
in
just
as
much
trouble
now
as
jim
turner
was
then
jim
manned
the
oars
and
we
took
out
after
our
raft
now
was
the
first
time
that
i
begun
to
worry
about
the
men
i
reckon
i
had
had
time
to
before
i
begun
to
think
how
dreadful
it
was
even
for
murderers
to
be
in
such
a
fix
i
says
to
myself
there
ai
no
telling
but
i
might
come
to
be
a
murderer
myself
yet
and
then
how
would
i
like
it
so
says
i
to
jim
the
first
light
we
see
we
land
a
hundred
yards
below
it
or
above
it
in
a
place
where
it
a
good
for
you
and
the
skiff
and
then
i
go
and
fix
up
some
kind
of
a
yarn
and
get
somebody
to
go
for
that
gang
and
get
them
out
of
their
scrape
so
they
can
be
hung
when
their
time
comes
but
that
idea
was
a
failure
for
pretty
soon
it
begun
to
storm
again
and
this
time
worse
than
ever
the
rain
poured
down
and
never
a
light
showed
everybody
in
bed
i
reckon
we
boomed
along
down
the
river
watching
for
lights
and
watching
for
our
raft
after
a
long
time
the
rain
let
up
but
the
clouds
stayed
and
the
lightning
kept
whimpering
and
by
and
by
a
flash
showed
us
a
black
thing
ahead
floating
and
we
made
for
it
it
was
the
raft
and
mighty
glad
was
we
to
get
aboard
of
it
again
we
seen
a
light
now
away
down
to
the
right
on
shore
so
i
said
i
would
go
for
it
the
skiff
was
half
full
of
plunder
which
that
gang
had
stole
there
on
the
wreck
we
hustled
it
on
to
the
raft
in
a
pile
and
i
told
jim
to
float
along
down
and
show
a
light
when
he
judged
he
had
gone
about
two
mile
and
keep
it
burning
till
i
come
then
i
manned
my
oars
and
shoved
for
the
light
as
i
got
down
towards
it
three
or
four
more
showed
up
on
a
hillside
it
was
a
village
i
closed
in
above
the
shore
light
and
laid
on
my
oars
and
floated
as
i
went
by
i
see
it
was
a
lantern
hanging
on
the
jackstaff
of
a
ferryboat
i
skimmed
around
for
the
watchman
whereabouts
he
slept
and
by
and
by
i
found
him
roosting
on
the
bitts
forward
with
his
head
down
between
his
knees
i
gave
his
shoulder
two
or
three
little
shoves
and
begun
to
cry
he
stirred
up
in
a
kind
of
a
startlish
way
but
when
he
see
it
was
only
me
he
took
a
good
gap
and
stretch
and
then
he
says
hello
what
up
do
cry
bub
what
the
trouble
i
says
pap
and
mam
and
sis
and
then
i
broke
down

says

troubles
and

and

to
get
people

something
but
they
said
in
such
a
night
and
such
a
current
there
ai
no
sense
in
it
go
for
the
now
if
you

to
and

the
dingnation

miss
hooker
she
tole
me
that
her
uncle
hornback
great
guns
is
her
uncle
looky
here
you
break
for
that
light
over
and
turn
out
west
when
you
git
there
and
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
out
you
come
to
the
tavern
tell
to
dart
you
out
to
jim
hornback
and
he
foot
the
bill
and
do
you
fool
around
any
because
he
want
to
know
the
news
tell
him
i
have
his
niece
all
safe
before
he
can
get
to
town
hump
yourself
now
up
around
the
corner
here
to
roust
out
my
engineer
i
struck
for
the
light
but
as
soon
as
he
turned
the
corner
i
went
back
and
got
into
my
skiff
and
bailed
her
out
and
then
pulled
up
shore
in
the
easy
water
about
six
hundred
yards
and
tucked
myself
in
among
some
for
i
could
rest
easy
till
i
could
see
the
ferryboat
start
but
take
it
all
around
i
was
feeling
ruther
comfortable
on
accounts
of
taking
all
this
trouble
for
that
gang
for
not
many
would
done
it
i
wished
the
widow
knowed
about
it
i
judged
she
would
be
proud
of
me
for
helping
these
rapscallions
because
rapscallions
and
is
the
kind
the
widow
and
good
people
takes
the
most
interest
in
well
before
long
here
comes
the
wreck
dim
and
dusky
sliding
along
down
a
kind
of
cold
shiver
went
through
me
and
then
i
struck
out
for
her
she
was
very
deep
and
i
see
in
a
minute
there
war
much
chance
for
anybody
being
alive
in
her
i
pulled
all
around
her
and
hollered
a
little
but
there
was
any
answer
all
dead
still
i
felt
a
little
bit
about
the
gang
but
not
much
for
i
reckoned
if
they
could
stand
it
i
could
then
here
comes
the
ferryboat
so
i
shoved
for
the
middle
of
the
river
on
a
long
slant
and
when
i
judged
i
was
out
of
i
laid
on
my
oars
and
looked
back
and
see
her
go
and
smell
around
the
wreck
for
miss
hooker
remainders
because
the
captain
would
know
her
uncle
hornback
would
want
them
and
then
pretty
soon
the
ferryboat
give
it
up
and
went
for
the
shore
and
i
laid
into
my
work
and
went
down
the
river
it
did
seem
a
powerful
long
time
before
jim
light
showed
up
and
when
it
did
show
it
looked
like
it
was
a
thousand
mile
off
by
the
time
i
got
there
the
sky
was
beginning
to
get
a
little
gray
in
the
east
so
we
struck
for
an
island
and
hid
the
raft
and
sunk
the
skiff
and
turned
in
and
slept
like
dead
people
chapter
xiv
by
and
by
when
we
got
up
we
turned
over
the
truck
the
gang
had
stole
off
of
the
wreck
and
found
boots
and
blankets
and
clothes
and
all
sorts
of
other
things
and
a
lot
of
books
and
a
and
three
boxes
of
seegars
we
had
ever
been
this
rich
before
in
neither
of
our
lives
the
seegars
was
prime
we
laid
off
all
the
afternoon
in
the
woods
talking
and
me
reading
the
books
and
having
a
general
good
time
i
told
jim
all
about
what
happened
inside
the
wreck
and
at
the
ferryboat
and
i
said
these
kinds
of
things

adventures
but
he
said
he
did
want
no
more
adventures
he
said
that
when
i
went
in
the
texas
and
he
crawled
back
to
get
on
the
raft
and
found
her
gone
he
nearly
died
because
he
judged
it
was
all
up
with
anyway
it
could
be
fixed
for
if
he
did
get
saved
he
would
get
drownded
and
if
he
did
get
saved
whoever
saved
him
would
send
him
back
home
so
as
to
get
the
reward
and
then
miss
watson
would
sell
him
south
sure
well
he
was
right

was
most
always
right
he
had
an
uncommon
level

to

i

a
nigger
to
argue
so
i
quit
chapter
xv
we
judged
that
three
nights
more
would
fetch
us
to
cairo
at
the
bottom
of
illinois
where
the
ohio
river
comes
in
and
that
was
what
we
was
after
we
would
sell
the
raft
and
get
on
a
steamboat
and
go
way
up
the
ohio
amongst
the
free
states
and
then
be
out
of
trouble
well
the
second
night
a
fog
begun
to
come
on
and
we
made
for
a
towhead
to
tie
to
for
it
would
do
to
try
to
run
in
a
fog
but
when
i
paddled
ahead
in
the
canoe
with
the
line
to
make
fast
there
anything
but
little
saplings
to
tie
to
i
passed
the
line
around
one
of
them
right
on
the
edge
of
the
cut
bank
but
there
was
a
stiff
current
and
the
raft
come
booming
down
so
lively
she
tore
it
out
by
the
roots
and
away
she
went
i
see
the
fog
closing
down
and
it
made
me
so
sick
and
scared
i
could
budge
for
most
a
half
a
minute
it
seemed
to
me
and
then
there
war
no
raft
in
sight
you
could
see
twenty
yards
i
jumped
into
the
canoe
and
run
back
to
the
stern
and
grabbed
the
paddle
and
set
her
back
a
stroke
but
she
did
come
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
i
had
untied
her
i
got
up
and
tried
to
untie
her
but
i
was
so
excited
my
hands
shook
so
i
could
hardly
do
anything
with
them
as
soon
as
i
got
started
i
took
out
after
the
raft
hot
and
heavy
right
down
the
towhead
that
was
all
right
as
far
as
it
went
but
the
towhead
war
sixty
yards
long
and
the
minute
i
flew
by
the
foot
of
it
i
shot
out
into
the
solid
white
fog
and
had
no
more
idea
which
way
i
was
going
than
a
dead
man
thinks
i
it
wo
do
to
paddle
first
i
know
i
run
into
the
bank
or
a
towhead
or
something
i
got
to
set
still
and
float
and
yet
mighty
fidgety
business
to
have
to
hold
your
hands
still
at
such
a
time
i
whooped
and
listened
away
down
there
somewheres
i
hears
a
small
whoop
and
up
comes
my
spirits
i
went
tearing
after
it
listening
sharp
to
hear
it
again
the
next
time
it
come
i
see
i
heading
for
it
but
heading
away
to
the
right
of
it
and
the
next
time
i
was
heading
away
to
the
left
of
it
and
not
gaining
on
it
much
either
for
i
was
flying
around
this
way
and
that
and
but
it
was
going
straight
ahead
all
the
time
i
did
wish
the
fool
would
think
to
beat
a
tin
pan
and
beat
it
all
the
time
but
he
never
did
and
it
was
the
still
places
between
the
whoops
that
was
making
the
trouble
for
me
well
i
fought
along
and
directly
i
hears
the
whoop
me
i
was
tangled
good
now
that
was
somebody
else
whoop
or
else
i
was
turned
around
i
throwed
the
paddle
down
i
heard
the
whoop
again
it
was
behind
me
yet
but
in
a
different
place
it
kept
coming
and
kept
changing
its
place
and
i
kept
answering
till
by
and
by
it
was
in
front
of
me
again
and
i
knowed
the
current
had
swung
the
canoe
head
and
i
was
all
right
if
that
was
jim
and
not
some
other
raftsman
hollering
i
could
tell
nothing
about
voices
in
a
fog
for
nothing
do
look
natural
nor
sound
natural
in
a
fog
the
whooping
went
on
and
in
about
a
minute
i
come
down
on
a
cut
bank
with
smoky
ghosts
of
big
trees
on
it
and
the
current
throwed
me
off
to
the
left
and
shot
by
amongst
a
lot
of
snags
that
fairly
roared
the
current
was
tearing
by
them
so
swift
in
another
second
or
two
it
was
solid
white
and
still
again
i
set
perfectly
still
then
listening
to
my
heart
thump
and
i
reckon
i
did
draw
a
breath
while
it
thumped
a
hundred
i
just
give
up
then
i
knowed
what
the
matter
was
that
cut
bank
was
an
island
and
jim
had
gone
down
side
of
it
it
war
no
towhead
that
you
could
float
by
in
ten
minutes
it
had
the
big
timber
of
a
regular
island
it
might
be
five
or
six
miles
long
and
more
than
half
a
mile
wide
i
kept
quiet
with
my
ears
cocked
about
fifteen
minutes
i
reckon
i
was
floating
along
of
course
four
or
five
miles
an
hour
but
you
do
ever
think
of
that
no
you
like
you
are
laying
dead
still
on
the
water
and
if
a
little
glimpse
of
a
snag
slips
by
you
do
think
to
yourself
how
fast
going
but
you
catch
your
breath
and
think
my
how
that
snag
tearing
along
if
you
think
it
ai
dismal
and
lonesome
out
in
a
fog
that
way
by
yourself
in
the
night
you
try
it
once
you
see
next
for
about
a
half
an
hour
i
whoops
now
and
then
at
last
i
hears
the
answer
a
long
ways
off
and
tries
to
follow
it
but
i
could
do
it
and
directly
i
judged
i
got
into
a
nest
of
towheads
for
i
had
little
dim
glimpses
of
them
on
both
sides
of
me
sometimes
just
a
narrow
channel
between
and
some
that
i
could
see
i
knowed
was
there
because
i
hear
the
wash
of
the
current
against
the
old
dead
brush
and
trash
that
hung
over
the
banks
well
i
war
long
loosing
the
whoops
down
amongst
the
towheads
and
i
only
tried
to
chase
them
a
little
while
anyway
because
it
was
worse
than
chasing
a
you
never
knowed
a
sound
dodge
around
so
and
swap
places
so
quick
and
so
much
i
had
to
claw
away
from
the
bank
pretty
lively
four
or
five
times
to
keep
from
knocking
the
islands
out
of
the
river
and
so
i
judged
the
raft
must
be
butting
into
the
bank
every
now
and
then
or
else
it
would
get
further
ahead
and
clear
out
of
hearing
it
was
floating
a
little
faster
than
what
i
was
well
i
seemed
to
be
in
the
open
river
again
by
and
by
but
i
hear
no
sign
of
a
whoop
nowheres
i
reckoned
jim
had
fetched
up
on
a
snag
maybe
and
it
was
all
up
with
him
i
was
good
and
tired
so
i
laid
down
in
the
canoe
and
said
i
would
bother
no
more
i
want
to
go
to
sleep
of
course
but
i
was
so
sleepy
i
could
help
it
so
i
thought
i
would
take
jest
one
little
but
i
reckon
it
was
more
than
a
for
when
i
waked
up
the
stars
was
shining
bright
the
fog
was
all
gone
and
i
was
spinning
down
a
big
bend
stern
first
first
i
did
know
where
i
was
i
thought
i
was
dreaming
and
when
things
began
to
come
back
to
me
they
seemed
to
come
up
dim
out
of
last
week
it
was
a
monstrous
big
river
here
with
the
tallest
and
the
thickest
kind
of
timber
on
both
banks
just
a
solid
wall
as
well
as
i
could
see
by
the
stars
i
looked
away
and
seen
a
black
speck
on
the
water
i
took
after
it
but
when
i
got
to
it
it
war
nothing
but
a
couple
of
made
fast
together
then
i
see
another
speck
and
chased
that
then
another
and
this
time
i
was
right
it
was
the
raft
when
i
got
to
it
jim
was
setting
there
with
his
head
down
between
his
knees
asleep
with
his
right
arm
hanging

about
ten
minutes
ago
and
i

you

drunk
in
that
time
so
of
course
you

dreaming
dad
fetch
it
how

i
gwyne
to
dream
all
dat
in
ten
minutes
well
hang

all
you

did
any
of
it

but

jis
as
plain
to
me
as
it
do
make
no
difference
how
plain
it
is
there
ai
nothing
in
it
i
know
because
i
been
here
all
the
time
jim
did
say
nothing
for
about
five
minutes
but
set
there
studying
over
it
then
he
says
well
den
i
i
did
dream
it
huck
but
dog
my
cats
ef
it
de
powerfulest
dream
i
ever
see
en
i
hai
ever
had
no
dream
dat
tired
me
like
dis
one
oh
well
that
all
right
because
a
dream
does
tire
a
body
like
everything
sometimes
but
this
one
was
a
staving
dream
tell
me
all
about
it
jim
so
jim
went
to
work
and
told
me
the
whole
thing
right
through
just
as
it
happened
only
he
painted
it
up
considerable
then
he
said
he
must
start
in
and
it
because
it
was
sent
for
a
warning
he
said
the
first
towhead
stood
for
a
man
that
would
try
to
do
us
some
good
but
the
current
was
another
man
that
would
get
us
away
from
him
the
whoops
was
warnings
that
would
come
to
us
every
now
and
then
and
if
we
did
try
hard
to
make
out
to
understand
them
they
just
take
us
into
bad
luck
of
keeping
us
out
of
it
the
lot
of
towheads
was
troubles
we
was
going
to
get
into
with
quarrelsome
people
and
all
kinds
of
mean
folks
but
if
we
minded
our
business
and
did
talk
back
and
aggravate
them
we
would
pull
through
and
get
out
of
the
fog
and
into
the
big
clear
river
which
was
the
free
states
and
have
no
more
trouble
it
had
clouded
up
pretty
dark
just
after
i
got
on
to
the
raft
but
it
was
clearing
up
again
now
oh
well
that
all
interpreted
well
enough
as
far
as
it
goes
jim
i
says
but
what
does
things
stand
for
it
was
the
leaves
and
rubbish
on
the
raft
and
the
smashed
oar
you
could
see
them
now
jim
looked
at
the
trash
and
then
looked
at
me
and
back
at
the
trash
again
he
had
got
the
dream
fixed
so
strong
in
his
head
that
he
could
seem
to
shake
it
loose
and
get
the
facts
back
into
its
place
again
right
away
but
when
he
did
get
the
thing
straightened
around
he
looked
at
me
steady
without
ever
smiling
and
says
what
do
dey
stan
for
i
gwyne
to
tell
you
when
i
got
all
wore
out
wid
work
en
wid
de
callin
for

en
went
to
sleep
my
heart
wuz
mos

en
i
didn

me
en

en
when

truck
dah
is
en
trash
is
what
people
is
dat
puts
dirt
on
de
head
er
dey
fren
en
makes
ashamed
then
he
got
up
slow
and
walked
to
the
wigwam
and
went
in
there
without
saying
anything
but
that
but
that
was
enough
it
made
me
feel
so
mean
i
could
almost
kissed
foot
to
get
him
to
take
it
back
it
was
fifteen
minutes
before
i
could
work
myself
up
to
go
and
humble
myself
to
a
nigger
but
i
done
it
and
i
war
ever
sorry
for
it
afterward
neither
i
did
do
him
no
more
mean
tricks
and
i
would
done
that
one
if
i
knowed
it
would
make
him
feel
that
way
chapter
xvi
we
slept
most
all
day
and
started
out
at
night
a
little
ways
behind
a
monstrous
long
raft
that
was
as
long
going
by
as
a
procession
she
had
four
long
sweeps
at
each
end
so
we
judged
she
carried
as
many
as
thirty
men
likely
she
had
five
big
wigwams
aboard
wide
apart
and
an
open
in
the
middle
and
a
tall
at
each
end
there
was
a
power
of
style
about
her
it
to
something
being
a
raftsman
on
such
a
craft
as
that
we
went
drifting
down
into
a
big
bend
and
the
night
clouded
up
and
got
hot
the
river
was
very
wide
and
was
walled
with
solid
timber
on
both
sides
you
could
see
a
break
in
it
hardly
ever
or
a
light
we
talked
about
cairo
and
wondered
whether
we
would
know
it
when
we
got
to
it
i
said
likely
we
would
because
i
had
heard
say
there
but
about
a
dozen
houses
there
and
if
they
did
happen
to
have
them
lit
up
how
was
we
going
to
know
we
was
passing
a
town
jim
said
if
the
two
big
rivers
joined
together
there
that
would
show
but
i
said
maybe
we
might
think
we
was
passing
the
foot
of
an
island
and
coming
into
the
same
old
river
again
that
disturbed
jim
and
me
too
so
the
question
was
what
to
do
i
said
paddle
ashore
the
first
time
a
light
showed
and
tell
them
pap
was
behind
coming
along
with
a
and
was
a
green
hand
at
the
business
and
wanted
to
know
how
far
it
was
to
cairo
jim
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
so
we
took
a
smoke
on
it
and
waited
there
war
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
look
out
sharp
for
the
town
and
not
pass
it
without
seeing
it
he
said
he
be
mighty
sure
to
see
it
because
he
be
a
free
man
the
minute
he
seen
it
but
if
he
missed
it
he
be
in
a
slave
country
again
and
no
more
show
for
freedom
every
little
while
he
jumps
up
and
says
dah
she
is
but
it
war
it
was
or
so
he
set
down
again
and
went
to
watching
same
as
before
jim
said
it
made
him
all
over
trembly
and
feverish
to
be
so
close
to
freedom
well
i
can
tell
you
it
made
me
all
over
trembly
and
feverish
too
to
hear
him
because
i
begun
to
get
it
through
my
head
that
he
most
free
and
who
was
to
blame
for
it
why
i
could
get
that
out
of
my
conscience
no
how
nor
no
way
it
got
to
troubling
me
so
i
rest
i
could
stay
still
in
one
place
it
had
ever
come
home
to
me
before
what
this
thing
was
that
i
was
doing
but
now
it
did
and
it
stayed
with
me
and
scorched
me
more
and
more
i
tried
to
make
out
to
myself
that
war
to
blame
because
did
run
jim
off
from
his
rightful
owner
but
it
war
no
use
conscience
up
and
says
every
time
but
you
knowed
he
was
running
for
his
freedom
and
you
could
paddled
ashore
and
told
somebody
that
was
so
i
get
around
that
no
way
that
was
where
it
pinched
conscience
says
to
me
what
had
poor
miss
watson
done
to
you
that
you
could
see
her
nigger
go
off
right
under
your
eyes
and
never
say
one
single
word
what
did
that
poor
old
woman
do
to
you
that
you
could
treat
her
so
mean
why
she
tried
to
learn
you
your
book
she
tried
to
learn
you
your
manners
she
tried
to
be
good
to
you
every
way
she
knowed
how
what
she
done
i
got
to
feeling
so
mean
and
so
miserable
i
most
wished
i
was
dead
i
fidgeted
up
and
down
the
raft
abusing
myself
to
myself
and
jim
was
fidgeting
up
and
down
past
me
we
neither
of
us
could
keep
still
every
time
he
danced
around
and
says
dah
cairo
it
went
through
me
like
a
shot
and
i
thought
if
it
cairo
i
reckoned
i
would
die
of
miserableness
jim
talked
out
loud
all
the
time
while
i
was
talking
to
myself
he
was
saying
how
the
first
thing
he
would
do
when
he
got
to
a
free
state
he
would
go
to
saving
up
money
and
never
spend
a
single
cent
and
when
he
got
enough
he
would
buy
his
wife
which
was
owned
on
a
farm
close
to
where
miss
watson
lived
and
then
they
would
both
work
to
buy
the
two
children
and
if
their
master
would
sell
them
they
get
an
to
go
and
steal
them
it
most
froze
me
to
hear
such
talk
he
would
ever
dared
to
talk
such
talk
in
his
life
before
just
see
what
a
difference
it
made
in
him
the
minute
he
judged
he
was
about
free
it
was
according
to
the
old
saying
give
a
nigger
an
inch
and
he
take
an
ell
thinks
i
this
is
what
comes
of
my
not
thinking
here
was
this
nigger
which
i
had
as
good
as
helped
to
run
away
coming
right
out
and
saying
he
would
steal
his
children
children
that
belonged
to
a
man
i
did
even
know
a
man
that
had
ever
done
me
no
harm
i
was
sorry
to
hear
jim
say
that
it
was
such
a
lowering
of
him
my
conscience
got
to
stirring
me
up
hotter
than
ever
until
at
last
i
says
to
it
let
up
on
me
it
ai
too
late
yet
i
paddle
ashore
at
the
first
light
and
tell
i
felt
easy
and
happy
and
light
as
a
feather
right
off
all
my
troubles
was
gone
i
went
to
looking
out
sharp
for
a
light
and
sort
of
singing
to
myself
by
and

and

old
coat
in
the
bottom
for
me
to
set

and
give

twenty
miles
and
you
come
to
a
town
on
the
side
of
the
river
it
will
be
long
after
then
and
when
you
ask
for
help
you
tell
them
your
folks
are
all

i
i

runaway
niggers
get
by
me
if
i
can
help
it
they
went
off
and
i
got
aboard
the
raft
feeling
bad
and
low
because
i
knowed
very
well
i
had
done
wrong
and
i
see
it
war
no
use
for
me
to
try
to
learn
to
do
right
a
body
that
do
get
right
when
he
little
ai
got
no
show
when
the
pinch
comes
there
nothing
to
back
him
up
and
keep
him
to
his
work
and
so
he
gets
beat
then
i
thought
a
minute
and
says
to
myself
hold
on
you

right
and
give
jim
up

you

better

i
feel
bad
i
feel
just
the
same
way
i
do
now
well
then
says
i
what
the
use
you
learning
to
do
right
when
troublesome
to
do
right
and
ai
no
trouble
to
do
wrong
and
the
wages
is
just
the
same
i
was
stuck
i
could
answer
that
so
i
reckoned
i
would
bother
no
more
about
it
but
after
this
always
do
whichever
come
handiest
at
the
time
i
went
into
the
wigwam
jim

then
we
talked
about
the
money
it
was
a
pretty
good
raise
twenty
dollars
apiece
jim
said
we
could
take
deck
passage
on
a
steamboat
now
and
the
money
would
last
us
as
far
as
we
wanted
to
go
in
the
free
states
he
said
twenty
mile
more
war
far
for
the
raft
to
go
but
he
wished
we
was
already
there
towards
daybreak
we
tied
up
and
jim
was
mighty
particular
about
hiding
the
raft
good
then
he
worked
all
day
fixing
things
in
bundles
and
getting
all
ready
to
quit
rafting
that
night
about
ten
we
hove
in
sight
of
the
lights
of
a
town
away
down
in
a
bend
i
went
off
in
the
canoe
to
ask
about
it
pretty
soon
i
found
a
man
out
in
the
river
with
a
skiff
setting
a
i
ranged
up
and
says
mister
is
that
town
cairo
cairo
no
you
must
be
a
blame
fool
what
town
is
it
mister
if
you
want
to
know
go
and
find
out
if
you
stay
here
around
me
for
about
a
half
a
minute
longer
you
get
something
you
wo
want
i
paddled
to
the
raft
jim
was
awful
disappointed
but
i
said
never
mind
cairo
would
be
the
next
place
i
reckoned
we
passed
another
town
before
daylight
and
i
was
going
out
again
but
it
was
high
ground
so
i
did
go
no
high
ground
about
cairo
jim
said
i
had
forgot
it
we
laid
up
for
the
day
on
a
towhead
tolerable
close
to
the
bank
i
begun
to
suspicion
something
so
did
jim
i
says
maybe
we
went
by
cairo
in
the
fog
that
night
he
says
doan
le
talk
about
it
huck
po
niggers
ca
have
no
luck
i
awluz
dat
war
done
wid
its
work
i
wish
i
never
seen
that
jim
i
do
wish
i
never
laid
eyes
on
it
it
ai
yo
fault
huck
you
did
know
do
you
blame
it
when
it
was
daylight
here
was
the
clear
ohio
water
inshore
sure
enough
and
outside
was
the
old
regular
muddy
so
it
was
all
up
with
cairo
we
talked
it
all
over
it
would
do
to
take
to
the
shore
we
could
take
the
raft
up
the
stream
of
course
there
war
no
way
but
to
wait
for
dark
and
start
back
in
the
canoe
and
take
the
chances
so
we
slept
all
day
amongst
the
cottonwood
thicket
so
as
to
be
fresh
for
the
work
and
when
we
went
back
to
the
raft
about
dark
the
canoe
was
gone
we
did
say
a
word
for
a
good
while
there
war
anything
to
say
we
both
knowed
well
enough
it
was
some
more
work
of
the
so
what
was
the
use
to
talk
about
it
it
would
only
look
like
we
was
finding
fault
and
that
would
be
bound
to
fetch
more
bad
luck
and
keep
on
fetching
it
too
till
we
knowed
enough
to
keep
still
by
and
by
we
talked
about
what
we
better
do
and
found
there
war
no
way
but
just
to
go
along
down
with
the
raft
till
we
got
a
chance
to
buy
a
canoe
to
go
back
in
we
war
going
to
borrow
it
when
there
war
anybody
around
the
way
pap
would
do
for
that
might
set
people
after
us
so
we
shoved
out
after
dark
on
the
raft
anybody
that
do
believe
yet
that
it
foolishness
to
handle
a
after
all
that
that
done
for
us
will
believe
it
now
if
they
read
on
and
see
what
more
it
done
for
us
the
place
to
buy
canoes
is
off
of
rafts
laying
up
at
shore
but
we
did
see
no
rafts
laying
up
so
we
went
along
during
three
hours
and
more
well
the
night
got
gray
and
ruther
thick
which
is
the
next
meanest
thing
to
fog
you
ca
tell
the
shape
of
the
river
and
you
ca
see
no
distance
it
got
to
be
very
late
and
still
and
then
along
comes
a
steamboat
up
the
river
we
lit
the
lantern
and
judged
she
would
see
it
boats
did
generly
come
close
to
us
they
go
out
and
follow
the
bars
and
hunt
for
easy
water
under
the
reefs
but
nights
like
this
they
bull
right
up
the
channel
against
the
whole
river
we
could
hear
her
pounding
along
but
we
did
see
her
good
till
she
was
close
she
aimed
right
for
us
often
they
do
that
and
try
to
see
how
close
they
can
come
without
touching
sometimes
the
wheel
bites
off
a
sweep
and
then
the
pilot
sticks
his
head
out
and
laughs
and
thinks
he
mighty
smart
well
here
she
comes
and
we
said
she
was
going
to
try
and
shave
us
but
she
did
seem
to
be
sheering
off
a
bit
she
was
a
big
one
and
she
was
coming
in
a
hurry
too
looking
like
a
black
cloud
with
rows
of
around
it
but
all
of
a
sudden
she
bulged
out
big
and
scary
with
a
long
row
of
furnace
doors
shining
like
teeth
and
her
monstrous
bows
and
guards
hanging
right
over
us
there
was
a
yell
at
us
and
a
jingling
of
bells
to
stop
the
engines
a
powwow
of
cussing
and
whistling
of
steam
and
as
jim
went
overboard
on
one
side
and
i
on
the
other
she
come
smashing
straight
through
the
raft
i
dived
and
i
aimed
to
find
the
bottom
too
for
a
wheel
had
got
to
go
over
me
and
i
wanted
it
to
have
plenty
of
room
i
could
always
stay
under
water
a
minute
this
time
i
reckon
i
stayed
under
a
minute
and
a
half
then
i
bounced
for
the
top
in
a
hurry
for
i
was
nearly
busting
i
popped
out
to
my
armpits
and
blowed
the
water
out
of
my
nose
and
puffed
a
bit
of
course
there
was
a
booming
current
and
of
course
that
boat
started
her
engines
again
ten
seconds
after
she
stopped
them
for
they
never
cared
much
for
raftsmen
so
now
she
was
churning
along
up
the
river
out
of
sight
in
the
thick
weather
though
i
could
hear
her
i
sung
out
for
jim
about
a
dozen
times
but
i
did
get
any
answer
so
i
grabbed
a
plank
that
touched
me
while
i
was
treading
water
and
struck
out
for
shore
shoving
it
ahead
of
me
but
i
made
out
to
see
that
the
drift
of
the
current
was
towards
the
shore
which
meant
that
i
was
in
a
crossing
so
i
changed
off
and
went
that
way
it
was
one
of
these
long
slanting
crossings
so
i
was
a
good
long
time
in
getting
over
i
made
a
safe
landing
and
clumb
up
the
bank
i
could
see
but
a
little
ways
but
i
went
poking
along
over
rough
ground
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
more
and
then
i
run
across
a
big
double
log
house
before
i
noticed
it
i
was
going
to
rush
by
and
get
away
but
a
lot
of
dogs
jumped
out
and
went
to
howling
and
barking
at
me
and
i
knowed
better
than
to
move
another
peg
chapter
xvii
in
about
a
minute
somebody
spoke
out
of
a
window

head

i
took
one
slow
step
at
a
time
and
there
war
a
sound
only
i
thought
i
could
hear
my
heart
the
dogs
were
as
still
as
the
humans
but
they
followed
a
little
behind
me
when
i
got
to
the
three
log
doorsteps
i
heard
them
unlocking
and
unbarring
and
unbolting
i
put
my
hand
on
the
door
and
pushed
it
a
little
and
a
little
more
till
somebody
said
there
that
enough
put
your
head
in
i
done
it
but
i
judged
they
would
take
it
off
the
candle
was
on
the
floor
and
there
they
all
was
looking
at
me
and
me
at
them
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
minute
three
big
men
with
guns
pointed
at
me
which
made
me
wince
i
tell
you
the
oldest
gray
and
about
sixty
the
other
two
thirty
or
more
all
of
them
fine
and
handsome
and
the
sweetest
old
lady
and
back
of
her
two
young
women
which
i
could
see
right
well
the
old
gentleman
says
there
i
reckon
it
all
right
come
in
as
soon
as
i
was
in
the
old
gentleman
he
locked
the
door
and
barred
it
and
bolted
it
and
told
the
young
men
to
come
in
with
their
guns
and
they
all
went
in
a
big
parlor
that
had
a
new
rag
carpet
on
the
floor
and
got
together
in
a
corner
that
was
out
of
the
range
of
the
front
windows
there
war
none
on
the
side
they
held
the
candle
and
took
a
good
look
at
me
and
all
said
why
ai
a
shepherdson
no
there
ai
any
shepherdson
about
him
then
the
old
man
said
he
hoped
i
would
mind
being
searched
for
arms
because
he
did
mean
no
harm
by
it
it
was
only
to
make
sure
so
he
did
pry
into
my
pockets
but
only
felt
outside
with
his
hands
and
said
it
was
all
right
he
told
me
to
make
myself
easy
and
at
home
and
tell
all
about
myself
but
the
old
lady
says
why
bless
you
saul
the
poor
thing
as
wet
as
he
can
be
and
you
reckon
it
may
be
he
hungry
true
for
you
rachel
i
forgot
so
the
old
lady
says
betsy
this
was
a
nigger
woman

fly
around
and
get
him
something
to
eat
as
quick
as
you
can
poor

one
of

and
wake

and
tell

buck
take
this
little
stranger
and
get
the
wet
clothes
off
from
him
and
dress
him
up
in
some
of
yours
that
dry
buck
looked
about
as
old
as
me
thirteen
or
fourteen
or
along
there
though
he
was
a
little
bigger
than
me
he
had
on
anything
but
a
shirt
and
he
was
very
he
came
in
gaping
and
digging
one
fist
into
his
eyes
and
he
was
dragging
a
gun
along
with
the
other
one
he
says
ai
they
no
shepherdsons
around
they
said
no
was
a
false
alarm
well
he
says
if
they
ben
some
i
reckon

one
they
all
laughed
and
bob
says

might
have
scalped

so
slow
in
coming
well
nobody

old
man

fret
about

with
you
now
and

as
your
mother

you
when
we
got
to
his
room
he
got
me
a
coarse
shirt
and
a
roundabout
and
pants
of
his
and
i
put
them
on
while
i
was
at
it
he
asked
me
what
my
name
was
but
before
i
could
tell
him
he
started
to
tell
me
about
a
bluejay
and
a
young
rabbit
he
had
catched
in
the
woods
day
before
yesterday
and
he
asked
me
where
moses
was
when
the
candle
went
out
i
said
i
did
know
i
had
heard
about

what
they

that

i

yet
buck
and
his
ma
and
all
of
them

cob
pipes
except

nigger
woman
which

and
the
two
young
women
they

the
young
women
had
quilts
around
them
and
their
hair
down
their
backs
they
all
asked
me
questions
and
i
told
them
how
pap
and
me
and
all
the
family
was
living
on
a
little
farm
down
at
the
bottom
of
arkansaw
and
my
sister
mary
ann
run
off
and
got
married
and
never
was
heard
of
no
more
and
bill
went
to
hunt
them
and
he
war
heard
of
no
more
and
tom
and
mort
died
and
then
there
war
nobody
but
just
me
and
pap
left
and
he
was
just
trimmed
down
to
nothing
on
account
of
his
troubles
so
when
he
died
i
took
what
there
was
left
because
the
farm
did
belong
to
us
and
started
up
the
river
deck
passage
and
fell
overboard
and
that
was
how
i
come
to
be
here
so
they
said
i
could
have
a
home
there
as
long
as
i
wanted
it
then
it
was
most
daylight
and
everybody
went
to
bed
and
i
went
to
bed
with
buck
and
when
i
waked
up
in
the
morning
drat
it
all
i
had
forgot
what
my
name
was
so
i
laid
there
about
an
hour
trying
to
think
and
when
buck
waked
up
i
says
can
you
spell
buck
yes
he
says
i
bet
you
ca
spell
my
name
says
i
i
bet
you
what
you
dare
i
can
says
he
all
right
says
i
go
ahead
there
now
he
says
well
says
i
you
done
it
but
i
did
think
you
could
it
no
slouch
of
a
name
to
spell
right
off
without
studying
i
set
it
down
private
because
somebody
might
want
to
spell
it
next
and
so
i
wanted
to
be
handy
with
it
and
rattle
it
off
like
i
was
used
to
it
it
was
a
mighty
nice
family
and
a
mighty
nice
house
too
i
had
seen
no
house
out
in
the
country
before
that
was
so
nice
and
had
so
much
style
it
did
have
an
iron
latch
on
the
front
door
nor
a
wooden
one
with
a
buckskin
string
but
a
brass
knob
to
turn
the
same
as
houses
in
town
there
war
no
bed
in
the
parlor
nor
a
sign
of
a
bed
but
heaps
of
parlors
in
towns
has
beds
in
them
there
was
a
big
fireplace
that
was
bricked
on
the
bottom
and
the
bricks
was
kept
clean
and
red
by
pouring
water
on
them
and
scrubbing
them
with
another
brick
sometimes
they
wash
them
over
with
red
that
they
call
same
as
they
do
in
town
they
had
big
brass
that
could
hold
up
a
there
was
a
clock
on
the
middle
of
the
mantelpiece
with
a
picture
of
a
town
painted
on
the
bottom
half
of
the
glass
front
and
a
round
place
in
the
middle
of
it
for
the
sun
and
you
could
see
the
pendulum
swinging
behind
it
it
was
beautiful
to
hear
that
clock
tick
and
sometimes
when
one
of
these
peddlers
had
been
along
and
scoured
her
up
and
got
her
in
good
shape
she
would
start
in
and
strike
a
hundred
and
fifty
before
she
got
tuckered
out
they
would
took
any
money
for
her
well
there
was
a
big
outlandish
parrot
on
each
side
of
the
clock
made
out
of
something
like
chalk
and
painted
up
gaudy
by
one
of
the
parrots
was
a
cat
made
of
crockery
and
a
crockery
dog
by
the
other
and
when
you
pressed
down
on
them
they
squeaked
but
did
open
their
mouths
nor
look
different
nor
interested
they
squeaked
through
underneath
there
was
a
couple
of
big
fans
spread
out
behind
those
things
on
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
kind
of
a
lovely
crockery
basket
that
had
apples
and
oranges
and
peaches
and
grapes
piled
up
in
it
which
was
much
redder
and
yellower
and
prettier
than
real
ones
is
but
they
war
real
because
you
could
see
where
pieces
had
got
chipped
off
and
showed
the
white
chalk
or
whatever
it
was
underneath
this
table
had
a
cover
made
out
of
beautiful
oilcloth
with
a
red
and
blue
painted
on
it
and
a
painted
border
all
around
it
come
all
the
way
from
philadelphia
they
said
there
was
some
books
too
piled
up
perfectly
exact
on
each
corner
of
the
table
one
was
a
big
family
bible
full
of
pictures
one
was
pilgrim
progress
about
a
man
that
left
his
family
it
did
say
why
i
read
considerable
in
it
now
and
then
the
statements
was
interesting
but
tough
another
was
friendship
offering
full
of
beautiful
stuff
and
poetry
but
i
did
read
the
poetry
another
was
henry
clay
speeches
and
another
was
gunn
family
medicine
which
told
you
all
about
what
to
do
if
a
body
was
sick
or
dead
there
was
a
and
a
lot
of
other
books
and
there
was
nice
chairs
and
perfectly
sound
too
not
bagged
down
in
the
middle
and
busted
like
an
old
basket
they
had
pictures
hung
on
the
walls
mainly
washingtons
and
lafayettes
and
battles
and
highland
marys
and
one
called
signing
the
declaration
there
was
some
that
they
called
crayons
which
one
of
the
daughters
which
was
dead
made
her
own
self
when
she
was
only
fifteen
years
old
they
was
different
from
any
pictures
i
ever
see
before
blacker
mostly
than
is
common
one
was
a
woman
in
a
slim
black
dress
belted
small
under
the
armpits
with
bulges
like
a
cabbage
in
the
middle
of
the
sleeves
and
a
large
black
bonnet
with
a
black
veil
and
white
slim
ankles
crossed
about
with
black
tape
and
very
wee
black
slippers
like
a
chisel
and
she
was
leaning
pensive
on
a
tombstone
on
her
right
elbow
under
a
weeping
willow
and
her
other
hand
hanging
down
her
side
holding
a
white
handkerchief
and
a
reticule
and
underneath
the
picture
it
said
shall
i
never
see
thee
more
alas
another
one
was
a
young
lady
with
her
hair
all
combed
up
straight
to
the
top
of
her
head
and
knotted
there
in
front
of
a
comb
like
a
and
she
was
crying
into
a
handkerchief
and
had
a
dead
bird
laying
on
its
back
in
her
other
hand
with
its
heels
up
and
underneath
the
picture
it
said
i
shall
never
hear
thy
sweet
chirrup
more
alas
there
was
one
where
a
young
lady
was
at
a
window
looking
up
at
the
moon
and
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
and
she
had
an
open
letter
in
one
hand
with
black
showing
on
one
edge
of
it
and
she
was
mashing
a
locket
with
a
chain
to
it
against
her
mouth
and
underneath
the
picture
it
said
and
art
thou
gone
yes
thou
art
gone
alas
these
was
all
nice
pictures
i
reckon
but
i
did
somehow
seem
to
take
to
them
because
if
ever
i
was
down
a
little
they
always
give
me
the
everybody
was
sorry
she
died
because
she
had
laid
out
a
lot
more
of
these
pictures
to
do
and
a
body
could
see
by
what
she
had
done
what
they
had
lost
but
i
reckoned
that
with
her
disposition
she
was
having
a
better
time
in
the
graveyard
she
was
at
work
on
what
they
said
was
her
greatest
picture
when
she
took
sick
and
every
day
and
every
night
it
was
her
prayer
to
be
allowed
to
live
till
she
got
it
done
but
she
never
got
the
chance
it
was
a
picture
of
a
young
woman
in
a
long
white
gown
standing
on
the
rail
of
a
bridge
all
ready
to
jump
off
with
her
hair
all
down
her
back
and
looking
up
to
the
moon
with
the
tears
running
down
her
face
and
she
had
two
arms
folded
across
her
breast
and
two
arms
stretched
out
in
front
and
two
more
reaching
up
toward
the
moon
and
the
idea
was
to
see
which
pair
would
look
best
and
then
scratch
out
all
the
other
arms
but
as
i
was
saying
she
died
before
she
got
her
mind
made
up
and
now
they
kept
this
picture
over
the
head
of
the
bed
in
her
room
and
every
time
her
birthday
come
they
hung
flowers
on
it
other
times
it
was
hid
with
a
little
curtain
the
young
woman
in
the
picture
had
a
kind
of
a
nice
sweet
face
but
there
was
so
many
arms
it
made
her
look
too
spidery
seemed
to
me
this
young
girl
kept
a
when
she
was
alive
and
used
to
paste
obituaries
and
accidents
and
cases
of
patient
suffering
in
it
out
of
the
presbyterian
observer
and
write
poetry
after
them
out
of
her
own
head
it
was
very
good
poetry
this
is
what
she
wrote
about
a
boy
by
the
name
of
stephen
dowling
bots
that
fell
down
a
well
and
was
drownded
ode
to
stephen
dowling
bots
and
did
young
stephen
sicken
and
did
young
stephen
die
and
did
the
sad
hearts
thicken
and
did
the
mourners
cry
no
such
was
not
the
fate
of
young
stephen
dowling
bots
though
sad
hearts
round
him
thickened
was
not
from
sickness
shots
no
did
rack
his
frame
nor
measles
drear
with
spots
not
these
impaired
the
sacred
name
of
stephen
dowling
bots
despised
love
struck
not
with
woe
that
head
of
curly
knots
nor
stomach
troubles
laid
him
low
young
stephen
dowling
bots
o
no
then
list
with
tearful
eye
whilst
i
his
fate
do
tell
his
soul
did
from
this
cold
world
fly
by
falling
down
a
well
they
got
him
out
and
emptied
him
alas
it
was
too
late
his
spirit
was
gone
for
to
sport
aloft
in
the
realms
of
the
good
and
great
if
emmeline
grangerford
could
make
poetry
like
that
before
she
was
fourteen
there
ai
no
telling
what
she
could
done
by
and
by
buck
said
she
could
rattle
off
poetry
like
nothing
she
did
ever
have
to
stop
to
think
he
said
she
would
slap
down
a
line
and
if
she
could
find
anything
to
rhyme
with
it
would
just
scratch
it
out
and
slap
down
another
one
and
go
ahead
she
war
particular
she
could
write
about
anything
you
choose
to
give
her
to
write
about
just
so
it
was
sadful
every
time
a
man
died
or
a
woman
died
or
a
child
died
she
would
be
on
hand
with
her
tribute
before
he
was
cold
she
called
them
tributes
the
neighbors
said
it
was
the
doctor
first
then
emmeline
then
the
undertaker
the
undertaker
never
got
in
ahead
of
emmeline
but
once
and
then
she
hung
fire
on
a
rhyme
for
the
dead
person
name
which
was
whistler
she
war
ever
the
same
after
that
she
never
complained
but
she
kinder
pined
away
and
did
not
live
long
poor
thing
many
the
time
i
made
myself
go
up
to
the
little
room
that
used
to
be
hers
and
get
out
her
poor
old
and
read
in
it
when
her
pictures
had
been
aggravating
me
and
i
had
soured
on
her
a
little
i
liked
all
that
family
dead
ones
and
all
and
going
to
let
anything
come
between
us
poor
emmeline
made
poetry
about
all
the
dead
people
when
she
was
alive
and
it
did
seem
right
that
there
war
nobody
to
make
some
about
her
now
she
was
gone
so
i
tried
to
sweat
out
a
verse
or
two
myself
but
i
could
seem
to
make
it
go
somehow
they
kept
emmeline
room
trim
and
nice
and
all
the
things
fixed
in
it
just
the
way
she
liked
to
have
them
when
she
was
alive
and
nobody
ever
slept
there
the
old
lady
took
care
of
the
room
herself
though
there
was
plenty
of
niggers
and
she
sewed
there
a
good
deal
and
read
her
bible
there
mostly
well
as
i
was
saying
about
the
parlor
there
was
beautiful
curtains
on
the
windows
white
with
pictures
painted
on
them
of
castles
with
vines
all
down
the
walls
and
cattle
coming
down
to
drink
there
was
a
little
old
piano
too
that
had
tin
pans
in
it
i
reckon
and
nothing
was
ever
so
lovely
as
to
hear
the
young
ladies
sing
the
last
link
is
broken
and
play
the
battle
of
prague
on
it
the
walls
of
all
the
rooms
was
plastered
and
most
had
carpets
on
the
floors
and
the
whole
house
was
whitewashed
on
the
outside
it
was
a
double
house
and
the
big
open
place
betwixt
them
was
roofed
and
floored
and
sometimes
the
table
was
set
there
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
it
was
a
cool
comfortable
place
nothing
could
be
better
and
war
the
cooking
good
and
just
bushels
of
it
too
chapter
xviii
grangerford
was
a
gentleman
you
see
he
was
a
gentleman
all
over
and
so
was
his
family
he
was
well
born
as
the
saying
is
and
that
worth
as
much
in
a
man
as
it
is
in
a
horse
so
the
widow
douglas
said
and
nobody
ever
denied
that
she
was
of
the
first
aristocracy
in
our
town
and
pap
he
always
said
it
too
though
he
war
no
more
quality
than
a
mudcat
himself
grangerford
was
very
tall
and
very
slim
and
had
a
complexion
not
a
sign
of
red
in
it
anywheres
he
was
every
morning
all
over
his
thin
face
and
he
had
the
thinnest
kind
of
lips
and
the
thinnest
kind
of
nostrils
and
a
high
nose
and
heavy
eyebrows
and
the
blackest
kind
of
eyes
sunk
so
deep
back
that
they
seemed
like
they
was
looking
out
of
caverns
at
you
as
you
may
say
his
forehead
was
high
and
his
hair
was
gray
and
straight
and
hung
to
his
shoulders
his
hands
was
long
and
thin
and
every
day
of
his
life
he
put
on
a
clean
shirt
and
a
full
suit
from
head
to
foot
made
out
of
linen
so
white
it
hurt
your
eyes
to
look
at
it
and
on
sundays
he
wore
a
blue
with
brass
buttons
on
it
he
carried
a
mahogany
cane
with
a
silver
head
to
it
there
war
no
frivolishness
about
him
not
a
bit
and
he
war
ever
loud
he
was
as
kind
as
he
could
be
you
could
feel
that
you
know
and
so
you
had
confidence
sometimes
he
smiled
and
it
was
good
to
see
but
when
he
straightened
himself
up
like
a
and
the
lightning
begun
to
flicker
out
from
under
his
eyebrows
you
wanted
to
climb
a
tree
first
and
find
out
what
the
matter
was
afterwards
he
did
ever
have
to
tell
anybody
to
mind
their
manners
everybody
was
always
where
he
was
everybody
loved
to
have
him
around
too
he
was
sunshine
most
always
i
mean
he
made
it
seem
like
good
weather
when
he
turned
into
a
it
was
awful
dark
for
half
a
minute
and
that
was
enough
there
would
nothing
go
wrong
again
for
a
week
when
him
and
the
old
lady
come
down
in
the
morning
all
the
family
got
up
out
of
their
chairs
and
give
them
good
day
and
did
set
down
again
till
they
had
set
down
then
tom
and
bob
went
to
the
sideboard
where
the
decanter
was
and
mixed
a
glass
of
bitters
and
handed
it
to
him
and
he
held
it
in
his
hand
and
waited
till
tom
and
bob
was
mixed
and
then
they
bowed
and
said
our
duty
to
you
sir
and
madam
and
bowed
the
least
bit
in
the
world
and
said
thank
you
and
so
they
drank
all
three
and
bob
and
tom
poured
a
spoonful
of
water
on
the
sugar
and
the
mite
of
whisky
or
in
the
bottom
of
their
tumblers
and
give
it
to
me
and
buck
and
we
drank
to
the
old
people
too
bob
was
the
oldest
and
tom
next
tall
beautiful
men
with
very
broad
shoulders
and
brown
faces
and
long
black
hair
and
black
eyes
they
dressed
in
white
linen
from
head
to
foot
like
the
old
gentleman
and
wore
broad
panama
hats
then
there
was
miss
charlotte
she
was
and
tall
and
proud
and
grand
but
as
good
as
she
could
be
when
she
war
stirred
up
but
when
she
was
she
had
a
look
that
would
make
you
wilt
in
your
tracks
like
her
father
she
was
beautiful
so
was
her
sister
miss
sophia
but
it
was
a
different
kind
she
was
gentle
and
sweet
like
a
dove
and
she
was
only
twenty
each
person
had
their
own
nigger
to
wait
on
them
buck
too
my
nigger
had
a
monstrous
easy
time
because
i
war
used
to
having
anybody
do
anything
for
me
but
buck
was
on
the
jump
most
of
the
time
this
was
all
there
was
of
the
family
now
but
there
used
to
be
more
three
sons
they
got
killed
and
emmeline
that
died
the
old
gentleman
owned
a
lot
of
farms
and
over
a
hundred
niggers
sometimes
a
stack
of
people
would
come
there
horseback
from
ten
or
fifteen
mile
around
and
stay
five
or
six
days
and
have
such
junketings
round
about
and
on
the
river
and
dances
and
picnics
in
the
woods
daytimes
and
balls
at
the
house
nights
these
people
was
mostly
kinfolks
of
the
family
the
men
brought
their
guns
with
them
it
was
a
handsome
lot
of
quality
i
tell
you
there
was
another
clan
of
aristocracy
around
there
five
or
six
families
mostly
of
the
name
of
shepherdson
they
was
as
and
well
born
and
rich
and
grand
as
the
tribe
of
grangerfords
the
shepherdsons
and
grangerfords
used
the
same
which
was
about
two
mile
above
our
house
so
sometimes
when
i
went
up
there
with
a
lot
of
our
folks
i
used
to
see
a
lot
of
the
shepherdsons
there
on
their
fine
horses
one
day
buck
and
me
was
away
out
in
the
woods
hunting
and
heard
a
horse
coming
we
was
crossing
the
road
buck
says
quick
jump
for
the
woods
we
done
it
and
then
peeped
down
the
woods
through
the
leaves
pretty
soon
a
splendid
young
man
came
galloping
down
the
road
setting
his
horse
easy
and
looking
like
a
soldier
he
had
his
gun
across
his
pommel
i
had
seen
him
before
it
was
young
harney
shepherdson
i
heard
buck
gun
go
off
at
my
ear
and
harney
hat
tumbled
off
from
his
head
he
grabbed
his
gun
and
rode
straight
to
the
place
where
we
was
hid
but
we
did
wait
we
started
through
the
woods
on
a
run
the
woods
war
thick
so
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
to
dodge
the
bullet
and
twice
i
seen
harney
cover
buck
with
his
gun
and
then
he
rode
away
the
way
he
come
to
get
his
hat
i
reckon
but
i
see
we
never
stopped
running
till
we
got
home
the
old
eyes
blazed
a
minute
was
pleasure
mainly
i
judged
then
his
face
sort
of
smoothed
down
and
he
says
kind
of
gentle
i
do
like
that
shooting
from
behind
a
bush
why
did
you
step
into
the
road
my
boy
the
shepherdsons
do
father
they
always
take
advantage
miss
charlotte
she
held
her
head
up
like
a
queen
while
buck
was
telling
his
tale
and
her
nostrils
spread
and
her
eyes
snapped
the
two
young
men
looked
dark
but
never
said
nothing
miss
sophia
she
turned
pale
but
the
color
come
back
when
she
found
the
man
hurt
soon
as
i
could
get
buck
down
by
the
under
the
trees
by
ourselves
i
says
did
you
want
to
kill
him
buck
well
i
bet
i
did
what
did
he
do
to
you
him
he
never
done
nothing
to
me
well
then
what
did
you
want
to
kill
him
for
why
nothing
only
it
on
account
of
the
feud
what
a
feud
why
where
was
you
raised
do
you
know
what
a
feud
is
never
heard
of
it
before
tell
me
about
it
well
says
buck
a
feud
is
this
way
a
man
has
a
quarrel
with
another
man
and
kills
him
then
that
other
man
brother
kills
then
the
other
brothers
on
both
sides
goes
for
one
another
then
the
chip
in
and
by
and
by
everybody
killed
off
and
there
ai
no
more
feud
but
it
kind
of
slow
and
takes
a
long
time
has
this
one
been
going
on
long
buck
well
i
should
it
started
thirty
year
ago
or
along
there
there
was
trouble
something
and
then
a
lawsuit
to
settle
it
and
the
suit
went
agin
one
of
the
men
and
so
he
up
and
shot
the
man
that
won
the
suit
which
he
would
naturally
do
of
course
anybody
would
what
was
the
trouble
about
buck
land
i
reckon
maybe
i
do
know
well
who
done
the
shooting
was
it
a
grangerford
shepherdson
laws
how
do
i
know
it
was
so
long
ago
do
anybody
know
oh
yes
pa
knows
i
reckon
and
some
of
the
other
old
people
but
they
do
know
now
what
the
row
was
about
in
the
first
place
has
there
been
many
killed
buck
yes
right
smart
chance
of
funerals
but
they
do
always
kill
got
a
few
buckshot
in
him
but
he
do
mind
it
he
do
weigh
much
anyway
bob
been
carved
up
some
with
a
bowie
and
tom
been
hurt
once
or
twice
has
anybody
been
killed
this
year
buck
yes
we
got
one
and
they
got
one
three
months
ago
my
cousin
bud
fourteen
year
old
was
riding
through
the
woods
on
side
of
the
river
and
did
have
no
weapon
with
him
which
was
foolishness
and
in
a
lonesome
place
he
hears
a
horse
behind
him
and
sees
old
baldy
shepherdson
after
him
with
his
gun
in
his
hand
and
his
white
hair
in
the
wind
and
of
jumping
off
and
taking
to
the
brush
bud
he
could
outrun
him
so
they
had
it
nip
and
tuck
for
five
mile
or
more
the
old
man
all
the
time
so
at
last
bud
seen
it
war
any
use
so
he
stopped
and
faced
around
so
as
to
have
the
in
front
you
know
and
the
old
man
he
rode
up
and
shot
him
down
but
he
did
git
much
chance
to
enjoy
his
luck
for
inside
of
a
week
our
folks
laid
out
i
reckon
that
old
man
was
a
coward
buck
i
reckon
he
a
coward
not
by
a
blame
sight
there
ai
a
coward
amongst
them
shepherdsons
not
a
one
and
there
ai
no
cowards
amongst
the
grangerfords
either
why
that
old
man
kep
up
his
end
in
a
fight
one
day
for
half
an
hour
against
three
grangerfords
and
come
out
winner
they
was
all
he
lit
off
of
his
horse
and
got
behind
a
little
woodpile
and
kep
his
horse
before
him
to
stop
the
bullets
but
the
grangerfords
stayed
on
their
horses
and
capered
around
the
old
man
and
peppered
away
at
him
and
he
peppered
away
at
them
him
and
his
horse
both
went
home
pretty
leaky
and
crippled
but
the
grangerfords
had
to
be
home
and
one
of
was
dead
and
another
died
the
next
day
no
sir
if
a
body
out
hunting
for
cowards
he
do
want
to
fool
away
any
time
amongst
them
shepherdsons
becuz
they
do
breed
any
of
that
next
sunday
we
all
went
to
church
about
three
mile
everybody
the
men
took
their
guns
along
so
did
buck
and
kept
them
between
their
knees
or
stood
them
handy
against
the
wall
the
shepherdsons
done
the
same
it
was
pretty
ornery
preaching
all
about
brotherly
love
and
tiresomeness
but
everybody
said
it
was
a
good
sermon
and
they
all
talked
it
over
going
home
and
had
such
a
powerful
lot
to
say
about
faith
and
good
works
and
free
grace
and
preforeordestination
and
i
do
know
what
all
that
it
did
seem
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
roughest
sundays
i
had
run
across
yet
about
an
hour
after
dinner
everybody
was
dozing
around
some
in
their
chairs
and
some
in
their
rooms
and
it
got
to
be
pretty
dull
buck
and
a
dog
was
stretched
out
on
the
grass
in
the
sun
sound
asleep
i
went
up
to
our
room
and
judged
i
would
take
a
nap
myself
i
found
that
sweet
miss
sophia
standing
in
her
door
which
was
next
to
ours
and
she
took
me
in
her
room
and
shut
the
door
very
soft
and
asked
me
if
i
liked
her
and
i
said
i
did
and
she
asked
me
if
i
would
do
something
for
her
and
not
tell
anybody
and
i
said
i
would
then
she
said
forgot
her
testament
and
left
it
in
the
seat
at
church
between
two
other
books
and
would
i
slip
out
quiet
and
go
there
and
fetch
it
to
her
and
not
say
nothing
to
nobody
i
said
i
would
so
i
slid
out
and
slipped
off
up
the
road
and
there
war
anybody
at
the
church
except
maybe
a
hog
or
two
for
there
war
any
lock
on
the
door
and
hogs
likes
a
puncheon
floor
in
because
it
cool
if
you
notice
most
folks
do
go
to
church
only
when
they
got
to
but
a
hog
is
different
says
i
to
myself
something
up
it
ai
natural
for
a
girl
to
be
in
such
a
sweat
about
a
testament
so
i
give
it
a
shake
and
out
drops
a
little
piece
of
paper
with
past
wrote
on
it
with
a
pencil
i
ransacked
it
but
could
find
anything
else
i
make
anything
out
of
that
so
i
put
the
paper
in
the
book
again
and
when
i
got
home
and
upstairs
there
was
miss
sophia
in
her
door
waiting
for
me
she
pulled
me
in
and
shut
the
door
then
she
looked
in
the
testament
till
she
found
the
paper
and
as
soon
as
she
read
it
she
looked
glad
and
before
a
body
could
think
she
grabbed
me
and
give
me
a
squeeze
and
said
i
was
the
best
boy
in
the
world
and
not
to
tell
anybody
she
was
mighty
red
in
the
face
for
a
minute
and
her
eyes
lighted
up
and
it
made
her
powerful
pretty
i
was
a
good
deal
astonished
but
when
i
got
my
breath
i
asked
her
what
the
paper
was
about
and
she
asked
me
if
i
had
read
it
and
i
said
no
and
she
asked
me
if
i
could
read
writing
and
i
told
her
no
only
and
then
she
said
the
paper
war
anything
but
a
to
keep
her
place
and
i
might
go
and
play
now
i
went
off
down
to
the
river
studying
over
this
thing
and
pretty
soon
i
noticed
that
my
nigger
was
following
along
behind
when
we
was
out
of
sight
of
the
house
he
looked
back
and
around
a
second
and
then
comes
and
says
mars

show

he
oughter
know
a
body
do
love
enough
to
go
around
hunting
for
them
what
is
he
up
to
anyway
so
i
says
all
right
trot
ahead
i
followed
a
half
a
mile
then
he
struck
out
over
the
swamp
and
waded
as
much
as
another
we
come
to
a
little
flat
piece
of
land
which
was
dry
and
very
thick
with
trees
and
bushes
and
vines

him
i
poked
into
the
place
and
come
to
a
little
open
patch

as

as

and
by
i
begin
to
hear
guns
a
good
ways
off
when
i
came
in
sight
of
the
log
store
and
the
woodpile
where
the
steamboats
lands
i
worked
along
under
the
trees
and
brush
till
i
got
to
a
good
place
and
then
i
clumb
up
into
the
forks
of
a
cottonwood
that
was
out
of
reach
and
watched
there
was
a
four
foot
high
a
little
ways
in
front
of
the
tree
and
first
i
was
going
to
hide
behind
that
but
maybe
it
was
luckier
i
did
there
was
four
or
five
men
cavorting
around
on
their
horses
in
the
open
place
before
the
log
store
cussing
and
yelling
and
trying
to
get
at
a
couple
of
young
chaps
that
was
behind
the
alongside
of
the
but
they
could
come
it
every
time
one
of
them
showed
himself
on
the
river
side
of
the
woodpile
he
got
shot
at
the
two
boys
was
squatting
back
to
back
behind
the
pile
so
they
could
watch
both
ways
by
and
by
the
men
stopped
cavorting
around
and
yelling
they
started
riding
towards
the
store
then
up
gets
one
of
the
boys
draws
a
steady
bead
over
the
and
drops
one
of
them
out
of
his
saddle
all
the
men
jumped
off
of
their
horses
and
grabbed
the
hurt
one
and
started
to
carry
him
to
the
store
and
that
minute
the
two
boys
started
on
the
run
they
got
to
the
tree
i
was
in
before
the
men
noticed
then
the
men
see
them
and
jumped
on
their
horses
and
took
out
after
them
they
gained
on
the
boys
but
it
did
do
no
good
the
boys
had
too
good
a
start
they
got
to
the
woodpile
that
was
in
front
of
my
tree
and
slipped
in
behind
it
and
so
they
had
the
bulge
on
the
men
again
one
of
the
boys
was
buck
and
the
other
was
a
slim
young
chap
about
nineteen
years
old
the
men
ripped
around
awhile
and
then
rode
away
as
soon
as
they
was
out
of
sight
i
sung
out
to
buck
and
told
him
he
did
know
what
to
make
of
my
voice
coming
out
of
the
tree
at
first
he
was
awful
surprised
he
told
me
to
watch
out
sharp
and
let
him
know
when
the
men
come
in
sight
again
said
they
was
up
to
some
devilment
or
other
would
be
gone
long
i
wished
i
was
out
of
that
tree
but
i
das
come
down
buck
begun
to
cry
and
rip
and
that
him
and
his
cousin
joe
that
was
the
other
young
chap
would
make
up
for
this
day
yet
he
said
his
father
and
his
two
brothers
was
killed
and
two
or
three
of
the
enemy
said
the
shepherdsons
laid
for
them
in
ambush
buck
said
his
father
and
brothers
ought
to
waited
for
their
relations
the
shepherdsons
was
too
strong
for
them
i
asked
him
what
was
become
of
young
harney
and
miss
sophia
he
said
they
got
across
the
river
and
was
safe
i
was
glad
of
that
but
the
way
buck
did
take
on
because
he
did
manage
to
kill
harney
that
day
he
shot
at
him
i
hai
ever
heard
anything
like
it
all
of
a
sudden
bang
bang
bang
goes
three
or
four
guns
the
men
had
slipped
around
through
the
woods
and
come
in
from
behind
without
their
horses
the
boys
jumped
for
the
river
both
of
them
hurt
and
as
they
swum
down
the
current
the
men
run
along
the
bank
shooting
at
them
and
singing
out
kill
them
kill
them
it
made
me
so
sick
i
most
fell
out
of
the
tree
i
ai
to
tell
that
happened
it
would
make
me
sick
again
if
i
was
to
do
that
i
wished
i
had
ever
come
ashore
that
night
to
see
such
things
i
ai
ever
going
to
get
shut
of
them
lots
of
times
i
dream
about
them
i
stayed
in
the
tree
till
it
begun
to
get
dark
afraid
to
come
down
sometimes
i
heard
guns
away
off
in
the
woods
and
twice
i
seen
little
gangs
of
men
gallop
past
the
log
store
with
guns
so
i
reckoned
the
trouble
was
still
on
i
was
mighty
downhearted
so
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
ever
go
anear
that
house
again
because
i
reckoned
i
was
to
blame
somehow
i
judged
that
that
piece
of
paper
meant
that
miss
sophia
was
to
meet
harney
somewheres
at
half
past
two
and
run
off
and
i
judged
i
ought
to
told
her
father
about
that
paper
and
the
curious
way
she
acted
and
then
maybe
he
would
locked
her
up
and
this
awful
mess
would
ever
happened
when
i
got
down
out
of
the
tree
i
crept
along
down
the
a
piece
and
found
the
two
bodies
laying
in
the
edge
of
the
water
and
tugged
at
them
till
i
got
them
ashore
then
i
covered
up
their
faces
and
got
away
as
quick
as
i
could
i
cried
a
little
when
i
was
covering
up
buck
face
for
he
was
mighty
good
to
me
it
was
just
dark
now
i
never
went
near
the
house
but
struck
through
the
woods
and
made
for
the
swamp
jim
war
on
his
island
so
i
tramped
off
in
a
hurry
for
the
crick
and
crowded
through
the
willows
to
jump
aboard
and
get
out
of
that
awful
country
the
raft
was
gone
my
souls
but
i
was
scared
i
could
get
my
breath
for
most
a
minute
then
i
raised
a
yell
a
voice
not
foot
from
me
says
good
lan
is
dat
you
honey
doan
make
no
noise
it
was
jim
voice
nothing
ever
sounded
so
good
before
i
run
along
the
bank
a
piece
and
got
aboard
and
jim
he
grabbed
me
and
hugged
me
he
was
so
glad
to
see
me
he
says
laws
bless
you
chile
i
right
down
sho
you
dead
been
heah
he
say

jes
dis
minute

down
towards

so
to

and
they

and
floated
down
the
river
there
something
up
there
that
help
them
think
so
so
do
you
lose
no
time
jim
but
just
shove
off
for
the
big
water
as
fast
as
ever
you
can
i
never
felt
easy
till
the
raft
was
two
mile
below
there
and
out
in
the
middle
of
the
mississippi
then
we
hung
up
our
signal
lantern
and
judged
that
we
was
free
and
safe
once
more
i
had
had
a
bite
to
eat
since
yesterday
so
jim
he
got
out
some
and
buttermilk
and
pork
and
cabbage
and
greens
there
ai
nothing
in
the
world
so
good
when
it
cooked
right
and
whilst
i
eat
my
supper
we
talked
and
had
a
good
time
i
was
powerful
glad
to
get
away
from
the
feuds
and
so
was
jim
to
get
away
from
the
swamp
we
said
there
war
no
home
like
a
raft
after
all
other
places
do
seem
so
cramped
up
and
smothery
but
a
raft
do
you
feel
mighty
free
and
easy
and
comfortable
on
a
raft
chapter
xix
two
or
three
days
and
nights
went
by
i
reckon
i
might
say
they
swum
by
they
slid
along
so
quiet
and
smooth
and
lovely
here
is
the
way
we
put
in
the
time
it
was
a
monstrous
big
river
down
there
sometimes
a
mile
and
a
half
wide
we
run
nights
and
laid
up
and
hid
daytimes
soon
as
night
was
most
gone
we
stopped
navigating
and
tied
up
nearly
always
in
the
dead
water
under
a
towhead
and
then
cut
young
cottonwoods
and
willows
and
hid
the
raft
with
them
then
we
set
out
the
lines
next
we
slid
into
the
river
and
had
a
swim
so
as
to
freshen
up
and
cool
off
then
we
set
down
on
the
sandy
bottom
where
the
water
was
about
and
watched
the
daylight
come
not
a
sound
anywheres
perfectly
still
just
like
the
whole
world
was
asleep
only
sometimes
the
bullfrogs
maybe
the
first
thing
to
see
looking
away
over
the
water
was
a
kind
of
dull
line
that
was
the
woods
on
side
you
could
make
nothing
else
out
then
a
pale
place
in
the
sky
then
more
paleness
spreading
around
then
the
river
softened
up
away
off
and
war
black
any
more
but
gray
you
could
see
little
dark
spots
drifting
along
ever
so
far
away
and
such
things
and
long
black
streaks
rafts
sometimes
you
could
hear
a
sweep
screaking
or
voices
it
was
so
still
and
sounds
come
so
far
and
by
and
by
you
could
see
a
streak
on
the
water
which
you
know
by
the
look
of
the
streak
that
there
a
snag
there
in
a
swift
current
which
breaks
on
it
and
makes
that
streak
look
that
way
and
you
see
the
mist
curl
up
off
of
the
water
and
the
east
reddens
up
and
the
river
and
you
make
out
a
log
cabin
in
the
edge
of
the
woods
away
on
the
bank
on
side
of
the
river
being
a
likely
and
piled
by
them
cheats
so
you
can
throw
a
dog
through
it
anywheres
then
the
nice
breeze
springs
up
and
comes
fanning
you
from
over
there
so
cool
and
fresh
and
sweet
to
smell
on
account
of
the
woods
and
the
flowers
but
sometimes
not
that
way
because
they
left
dead
fish
laying
around
gars
and
such
and
they
do
get
pretty
rank
and
next
you
got
the
full
day
and
everything
smiling
in
the
sun
and
the
just
going
it
a
little
smoke
could
be
noticed
now
so
we
would
take
some
fish
off
of
the
lines
and
cook
up
a
hot
breakfast
and
afterwards
we
would
watch
the
lonesomeness
of
the
river
and
kind
of
lazy
along
and
by
and
by
lazy
off
to
sleep
wake
up
by
and
by
and
look
to
see
what
done
it
and
maybe
see
a
steamboat
coughing
along
so
far
off
towards
the
other
side
you
could
tell
nothing
about
her
only
whether
she
was
a
or
then
for
about
an
hour
there
would
be
nothing
to
hear
nor
nothing
to
see
just
solid
lonesomeness
next
you
see
a
raft
sliding
by
away
off
yonder
and
maybe
a
galoot
on
it
chopping
because
they
most
always
doing
it
on
a
raft
you
see
the
ax
flash
and
come
down
you
do
hear
nothing
you
see
that
ax
go
up
again
and
by
the
time
it
above
the
man
head
then
you
hear
the
it
had
took
all
that
time
to
come
over
the
water
so
we
would
put
in
the
day
lazying
around
listening
to
the
stillness
once
there
was
a
thick
fog
and
the
rafts
and
things
that
went
by
was
beating
tin
pans
so
the
steamboats
would
run
over
them
a
scow
or
a
raft
went
by
so
close
we
could
hear
them
talking
and
cussing
and
laughing
heard
them
plain
but
we
could
see
no
sign
of
them
it
made
you
feel
crawly
it
was
like
spirits
carrying
on
that
way
in
the
air
jim
said
he
believed
it
was
spirits
but
i
says
no
spirits
would
say
the
dern
fog
soon
as
it
was
night
out
we
shoved
when
we
got
her
out
to
about
the
middle
we
let
her
alone
and
let
her
float
wherever
the
current
wanted
her
to
then
we
lit
the
pipes
and
dangled
our
legs
in
the
water
and
talked
about
all
kinds
of
things
we
was
always
naked
day
and
night
whenever
the
mosquitoes
would
let
us
the
new
clothes
buck
folks
made
for
me
was
too
good
to
be
comfortable
and
besides
i
did
go
much
on
clothes
nohow
sometimes
we
have
that
whole
river
all
to
ourselves
for
the
longest
time
yonder
was
the
banks
and
the
islands
across
the
water
and
maybe
a
spark
which
was
a
candle
in
a
cabin
window
and
sometimes
on
the
water
you
could
see
a
spark
or
two
on
a
raft
or
a
scow
you
know
and
maybe
you
could
hear
a
fiddle
or
a
song
coming
over
from
one
of
them
crafts
it
lovely
to
live
on
a
raft
we
had
the
sky
up
there
all
speckled
with
stars
and
we
used
to
lay
on
our
backs
and
look
up
at
them
and
discuss
about
whether
they
was
made
or
only
just
happened
jim
he
allowed
they
was
made
but
i
allowed
they
happened
i
judged
it
would
have
took
too
long
to
so
many
jim
said
the
moon
could
them
well
that
looked
kind
of
reasonable
so
i
did
say
nothing
against
it
because
i
seen
a
frog
lay
most
as
many
so
of
course
it
could
be
done
we
used
to
watch
the
stars
that
fell
too
and
see
them
streak
down
jim
allowed
they
got
spoiled
and
was
hove
out
of
the
nest
once
or
twice
of
a
night
we
would
see
a
steamboat
slipping
along
in
the
dark
and
now
and
then
she
would
belch
a
whole
world
of
sparks
up
out
of
her
chimbleys
and
they
would
rain
down
in
the
river
and
look
awful
pretty
then
she
would
turn
a
corner
and
her
lights
would
wink
out
and
her
powwow
shut
off
and
leave
the
river
still
again
and
by
and
by
her
waves
would
get
to
us
a
long
time
after
she
was
gone
and
joggle
the
raft
a
bit
and
after
that
you
would
hear
nothing
for
you
could
tell
how
long
except
maybe
frogs
or
something
after
midnight
the
people
on
shore
went
to
bed
and
then
for
two
or
three
hours
the
shores
was
black
no
more
sparks
in
the
cabin
windows
these
sparks
was
our
clock
the
first
one
that
showed
again
meant
morning
was
coming
so
we
hunted
a
place
to
hide
and
tie
up
right
away
one
morning
about
daybreak
i
found
a
canoe
and
crossed
over
a
chute
to
the
main
shore
it
was
only
two
hundred
yards
and
paddled
about
a
mile
up
a
crick
amongst
the
cypress
woods
to
see
if
i
could
get
some
berries
just
as
i
was
passing
a
place
where
a
kind
of
a
cowpath
crossed
the
crick
here
comes
a
couple
of
men
tearing
up
the
path
as
tight
as
they
could
foot
it
i
thought
i
was
a
goner
for
whenever
anybody
was
after
anybody
i
judged
it
was
or
maybe
jim
i
was
about
to
dig
out
from
there
in
a
hurry
but
they
was
pretty
close
to
me
then
and
sung
out
and
begged
me
to
save
their
lives
said
they
had
been
doing
nothing
and
was
being
chased
for
it
said
there
was
men
and
dogs
they
wanted
to
jump
right
in
but
i
says
do
you
do
it
i
do
hear
the
dogs
and
horses
yet
you
got
time
to
crowd
through
the
brush
and
get
up
the
crick
a
little
ways
then
you
take
to
the
water
and
wade
down
to
me
and
get
in
that
throw
the
dogs
off
the
scent
they
done
it
and
soon
as
they
was
aboard
i
lit
out
for
our
towhead
and
in
about
five
or
ten
minutes
we
heard
the
dogs
and
the
men
away
off
shouting
we
heard
them
come
along
towards
the
crick
but
could
see
them
they
seemed
to
stop
and
fool
around
awhile
then
as
we
got
further
and
further
away
all
the
time
we
could
hardly
hear
them
at
all
by
the
time
we
had
left
a
mile
of
woods
behind
us
and
struck
the
river
everything
was
quiet
and
we
paddled
over
to
the
towhead
and
hid
in
the
cottonwoods
and
was
safe
one
of
these
fellows
was
about
seventy
or
upwards
and
had
a
bald
head
and
very
gray
whiskers
he
had
an
old
slouch
hat
on
and
a
greasy
blue
woolen
shirt
and
ragged
old
blue
jeans
britches
stuffed
into
his
and
galluses
no
he
only
had
one
he
had
an
old
blue
jeans
coat
with
slick
brass
buttons
flung
over
his
arm
and
both
of
them
had
big
fat
the
other
fellow
was
about
thirty
and
dressed
about
as
ornery
after
breakfast
we
all
laid
off
and
talked
and
the
first
thing
that
come
out
was
that
these
chaps
did
know
one
another
what

you
into
trouble

the
baldhead

side
of

and
you
told

i

a

jim
eyes
bugged
out
when

and
i
reckon

too
then
the
baldhead
says
no
you
ca
mean
it
yes
my
eldest
son
of
the
duke
of
bridgewater
fled
to
this
country
about
the
end
of
the
last
century
to
breathe
the
pure
air
of
freedom
married
here
and
died
leaving
a
son
his
own
father
dying
about
the
same
time
the
second
son
of
the
late
duke
seized
the
titles
and
estates
the
infant
real
duke
was
ignored
i
am
the
lineal
descendant
of
that
infant
i
am
the
rightful
duke
of
bridgewater
and
here
am
i
forlorn
torn
from
my
high
estate
hunted
of
men
despised
by
the
cold
world
ragged
worn
heartbroken
and
degraded
to
the
companionship
of
felons
on
a
raft
jim
pitied
him
ever
so
much
and
so
did
i
we
tried
to
comfort
him
but
he
said
it
war
much
use
he
could
be
much
comforted
said
if
we
was
a
mind
to
acknowledge
him
that
would
do
him
more
good
than
most
anything
else
so
we
said
we
would
if
he
would
tell
us
how
he
said
we
ought
to
bow
when
we
spoke
to
him
and
say
your
grace
or
my
lord
or
your
lordship
and
he
would
mind
it
if
we
called
him
plain
bridgewater
which
he
said
was
a
title
anyway
and
not
a
name
and
one
of
us
ought
to
wait
on
him
at
dinner
and
do
any
little
thing
for
him
he
wanted
done
well
that
was
all
easy
so
we
done
it
all
through
dinner
jim
stood
around
and
waited
on
him
and
says
will
yo
grace
have
some
o
dis
or
some
o
dat
and
so
on
and
a
body
could
see
it
was
mighty
pleasing
to
him
but
the
old
man
got
pretty
silent
by
and
by
did
have
much
to
say
and
did
look
pretty
comfortable
over
all
that
petting
that
was
going
on
around
that
duke
he
seemed
to
have
something
on
his
mind
so
along
in
the
afternoon
he
says
looky
here

he
says

says
the
old
man
still
sort
of
sobbing
to
the
bitter
death
he
took
the
old
man
by
the
hand
and
squeezed
it
and
says

secret
of
your
being

i

late

premature

yes
gentlemen
you
see
before
you
in
blue
jeans
and
misery
the
wanderin
exiled
and
sufferin
rightful
king
of
france
well
he
cried
and
took
on
so
that
me
and
jim
did
know
hardly
what
to
do
we
was
so
sorry
and
so
glad
and
proud
we
got
him
with
us
too
so
we
set
in
like
we
done
before
with
the
duke
and
tried
to
comfort
but
he
said
it
war
no
use
nothing
but
to
be
dead
and
done
with
it
all
could
do
him
any
good
though
he
said
it
often
made
him
feel
easier
and
better
for
a
while
if
people
treated
him
according
to
his
rights
and
got
down
on
one
knee
to
speak
to
him
and
always
called
him
your
majesty
and
waited
on
him
first
at
meals
and
did
set
down
in
his
presence
till
he
asked
them
so
jim
and
me
set
to
majestying
him
and
doing
this
and
that
and
for
him
and
standing
up
till
he
told
us
we
might
set
down
this
done
him
heaps
of
good
and
so
he
got
cheerful
and
comfortable
but
the
duke
kind
of
soured
on
him
and
did
look
a
bit
satisfied
with
the
way
things
was
going
still
the
king
acted
real
friendly
towards
him
and
said
the
duke
and
all
the
other
dukes
of
bilgewater
was
a
good
deal
thought
of
by
father
and
was
allowed
to
come
to
the
palace
considerable
but
the
duke
stayed
huffy
a
good
while
till
by
and
by
the
king
says
like
as
not
we
got
to
be
together
a
blamed
long
time
on
this
raft
bilgewater
and
so
what
the
use
o
your
bein
sour
it
only
make
things
oncomfortable
it
ai
my
fault
i
war
born
a
duke
it
ai
your
fault
you
war
born
a
king
so
what
the
use
to
worry
make
the
best
o
things
the
way
you
find
says
i
that
my
motto
this
ai
no
bad
thing
that
we
struck
here
plenty
grub
and
an
easy
life
come
give
us
your
hand
duke
and
le
all
be
friends
the
duke
done
it
and
jim
and
me
was
pretty
glad
to
see
it
it
took
away
all
the
uncomfortableness
and
we
felt
mighty
good
over
it
because
it
would
been
a
miserable
business
to
have
any
unfriendliness
on
the
raft
for
what
you
want
above
all
things
on
a
raft
is
for
everybody
to
be
satisfied
and
feel
right
and
kind
towards
the
others
it
did
take
me
long
to
make
up
my
mind
that
these
liars
war
no
kings
nor
dukes
at
all
but
just
humbugs
and
frauds
but
i
never
said
nothing
never
let
on
kept
it
to
myself
it
the
best
way
then
you
do
have
no
quarrels
and
do
get
into
no
trouble
if
they
wanted
us
to
call
them
kings
and
dukes
i
had
no
objections
as
it
would
keep
peace
in
the
family
and
it
no
use
to
tell
jim
so
i
did
tell
him
if
i
never
learnt
nothing
else
out
of
pap
i
learnt
that
the
best
way
to
get
along
with
his
kind
of
people
is
to
let
them
have
their
own
way
chapter
xx
they
asked
us
considerable
many
questions
wanted
to
know
what
we
covered
up
the
raft
that
way
for
and
laid
by
in
the
daytime
instead
of
running
was
jim
a
runaway
nigger
says
i
goodness
sakes
would
a
runaway
nigger
run
no
they
allowed
he
would
i
had
to
account
for
things
some
way
so
i
says
my
folks
was
living
in
pike
county
in
missouri
where
i
was
born
and
they
all
died
off
but
me
and
pa
and
my
brother
ike
pa
he
he
break
up
and
go
down
and
live
with
uncle
ben
who
got
a
little
place
on
the
river
mile
below
orleans
pa
was
pretty
poor
and
had
some
debts
so
when
he
squared
up
there
nothing
left
but
sixteen
dollars
and
our
nigger
jim
that
enough
to
take
us
fourteen
hundred
mile
deck
passage
nor
no
other
way
well
when
the
river
rose
pa
had
a
streak
of
luck
one
day
he
ketched
this
piece
of
a
raft
so
we
reckoned
we
go
down
to
orleans
on
it
pa
luck
did
hold
out
a
steamboat
run
over
the
forrard
corner
of
the
raft
one
night
and
we
all
went
overboard
and
dove
under
the
wheel
jim
and
me
come
up
all
right
but
pa
was
drunk
and
ike
was
only
four
years
old
so
they
never
come
up
no
more
well
for
the
next
day
or
two
we
had
considerable
trouble
because
people
was
always
coming
out
in
skiffs
and
trying
to
take
jim
away
from
me
saying
they
believed
he
was
a
runaway
nigger
we
do
run
daytimes
no
more
now
nights
they
do
bother
us
the
duke
says
leave
me
alone
to
cipher
out
a
way
so
we
can
run
in
the
daytime
if
we
want
to
i
think
the
thing
over
i
invent
a
plan
that
fix
it
we
let
it
alone
for
because
of
course
we
do
want
to
go
by
that
town
yonder
in
daylight
it
might
be
healthy
towards
night
it
begun
to
darken
up
and
look
like
rain
the
was
squirting
around
low
down
in
the
sky
and
the
leaves
was
beginning
to
shiver
it
was
going
to
be
pretty
ugly
it
was
easy
to
see
that
so
the
duke
and
the
king
went
to
overhauling
our
wigwam
to
see
what
the
beds
was
like
my
bed
was
a
straw
tick
better
than
jim
which
was
a
tick
there
always
cobs
around
about
in
a
shuck
tick
and
they
poke
into
you
and
hurt
and
when
you
roll
over
the
dry
shucks
sound
like
you
was
rolling
over
in
a
pile
of
dead
leaves
it
makes
such
a
rustling
that
you
wake
up
well
the
duke
allowed
he
would
take
my
bed
but
the
king
allowed
he
would
he
says
i
should
reckoned
the
difference
in
rank
would
a
sejested
to
you
that
a
bed
war
just
fitten
for
me
to
sleep
on
your
grace
take
the
shuck
bed
yourself
jim
and
me
was
in
a
sweat
again
for
a
minute
being
afraid
there
was
going
to
be
some
more
trouble
amongst
them
so
we
was
pretty
glad
when
the
duke
says
is
my
fate
to
be
always
ground
into
the
mire
under
the
iron
heel
of
oppression
misfortune
has
broken
my
once
haughty
spirit
i
yield
i
submit
is
my
fate
i
am
alone
in
the
world
let
me
suffer
i
can
bear
it
we
got
away
as
soon
as
it
was
good
and
dark
the
king
told
us
to
stand
well
out
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
and
not
show
a
light
till
we
got
a
long
ways
below
the
town
we
come
in
sight
of
the
little
bunch
of
lights
by
and
by
that
was
the
town
you
know
and
slid
by
about
a
half
a
mile
out
all
right
when
we
was
of
a
mile
below
we
hoisted
up
our
signal
lantern
and
about
ten
it
come
on
to
rain
and
blow
and
thunder
and
lighten
like
everything
so
the
king
told
us
to
both
stay
on
watch
till
the
weather
got
better
then
him
and
the
duke
crawled
into
the
wigwam
and
turned
in
for
the
night
it
was
my
watch
below
till
twelve
but
i
would
turned
in
anyway
if
i
had
a
bed
because
a
body
do
see
such
a
storm
as
that
every
day
in
the
week
not
by
a
long
sight
my
souls
how
the
wind
did
scream
along
and
every
second
or
two
there
come
a
glare
that
lit
up
the
for
a
half
a
mile
around
and
you
see
the
islands
looking
dusty
through
the
rain
and
the
trees
thrashing
around
in
the
wind
then
comes
a
bum
bum
and
the
thunder
would
go
rumbling
and
grumbling
away
and
quit
and
then
comes
another
flash
and
another
the
waves
most
washed
me
off
the
raft
sometimes
but
i
had
any
clothes
on
and
did
mind
we
did
have
no
trouble
about
snags
the
lightning
was
glaring
and
flittering
around
so
constant
that
we
could
see
them
plenty
soon
enough
to
throw
her
head
this
way
or
that
and
miss
them
i
had
the
middle
watch
you
know
but
i
was
pretty
sleepy
by
that
time
so
jim
he
said
he
would
stand
the
first
half
of
it
for
me
he
was
always
mighty
good
that
way
jim
was
i
crawled
into
the
wigwam
but
the
king
and
the
duke
had
their
legs
sprawled
around
so
there
war
no
show
for
me
so
i
laid
outside
i
did
mind
the
rain
because
it
was
warm
and
the
waves
war
running
so
high
now
about
two
they
come
up
again
though
and
jim
was
going
to
call
me
but
he
changed
his
mind
because
he
reckoned
they
war
high
enough
yet
to
do
any
harm
but
he
was
mistaken
about
that
for
pretty
soon
all
of
a
sudden
along
comes
a
regular
ripper
and
washed
me
overboard
it
most
killed
jim
he
was
the
easiest
nigger
to
laugh
that
ever
was
anyway
i
took
the
watch
and
jim
he
laid
down
and
snored
away
and
by
and
by
the
storm
let
up
for
good
and
all
and
the
first
that
showed
i
rousted
him
out
and
we
slid
the
raft
into
for
the
day
the
king
got
out
an
old
ratty
deck
of
cards
after
breakfast
and
him
and
the
duke
played
awhile
five
cents
a
game
then
they
got
tired
of
it
and
allowed
they
would
lay
out
a
campaign
as
they
called
it
the
duke
went
down
into
his
and
fetched
up
a
lot
of
little
printed
bills
and
read
them
out
loud
one
bill
said
the
celebrated
armand
de
montalban
of
paris
would
lecture
on
the
science
of
phrenology
at
such
and
such
a
place
on
the
blank
day
of
blank
at
ten
cents
admission
and
furnish
charts
of
character
at
cents
apiece
the
duke
said
that
was
in
another
bill
he
was
the
shakespearian
tragedian
garrick
the
younger
of
drury
lane
london
in
other
bills
he
had
a
lot
of
other
names
and
done
other
wonderful
things
like
finding
water
and
gold
with
a
dissipating
witch
spells
and
so
on
by
and
by
he
says
but
the
histrionic
muse
is
the
darling
have
you
ever
trod
the
boards
royalty
no
says
the
king
you
shall
then
before
you
three
days
older
fallen
grandeur
says
the
duke
the
first
good
town
we
come
to
we
hire
a
hall
and
do
the
swordfight
in
iii
and
the
balcony
scene
in
and
juliet
how
does
that
strike
you
i
in
up
to
the
hub
for
anything
that
will
pay
bilgewater
but
you
see
i
do
know
nothing
about
and
hai
ever
seen
much
of
it
i
was
too
small
when
pap
used
to
have
at
the
palace
do
you
reckon
you
can
learn
me
easy
all
right
i
jist
for
something
fresh
anyway
commence
right
away
so
the
duke
he
told
him
all
about
who
romeo
was
and
who
juliet
was
and
said
he
was
used
to
being
romeo
so
the
king
could
be
juliet
but
if
juliet
such
a
young
gal
duke
my
peeled
head
and
my
white
whiskers
is
goin
to
look
oncommon
odd
on
her
maybe
no
do
you
worry
these
country
jakes
wo
ever
think
of
that
besides
you
know
you
be
in
costume
and
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
juliet
in
a
balcony
enjoying
the
moonlight
before
she
goes
to
bed
and
she
got
on
her
nightgown
and
her
ruffled
nightcap
here
are
the
costumes
for
the
parts
he
got
out
two
or
three
suits
which
he
said
was
meedyevil
armor
for
richard
iii
and
chap
and
a
long
white
cotton
nightshirt
and
a
ruffled
nightcap
to
match
the
king
was
satisfied
so
the
duke
got
out
his
book
and
read
the
parts
over
in
the
most
splendid
way
prancing
around
and
acting
at
the
same
time
to
show
how
it
had
got
to
be
done
then
he
give
the
book
to
the
king
and
told
him
to
get
his
part
by
heart
there
was
a
little
town
about
three
mile
down
the
bend
and
after
dinner
the
duke
said
he
had
ciphered
out
his
idea
about
how
to
run
in
daylight
without
it
being
dangersome
for
jim
so
he
allowed
he
would
go
down
to
the
town
and
fix
that
thing
the
king
allowed
he
would
go
too
and
see
if
he
could
strike
something
we
was
out
of
coffee
so
jim
said
i
better
go
along
with
them
in
the
canoe
and
get
some
when
we
got
there
there
war
nobody
stirring
streets
empty
and
perfectly
dead
and
still
like
sunday
we
found
a
sick
nigger
sunning
himself
in
a
back
yard
and
he
said
everybody
that
war
too
young
or
too
sick
or
too
old
was
gone
to
about
two
mile
back
in
the
woods
the
king
got
the
directions
and
allowed
he
go
and
work
that
for
all
it
was
worth
and
i
might
go
too
the
duke
said
what
he
was
after
was
a
we
found
it
a
little
bit
of
a
concern
up
over
a
carpenters
and
printers
all
gone
to
the
meeting
and
no
doors
locked
it
was
a
dirty
place
and
had
and
handbills
with
pictures
of
horses
and
runaway
niggers
on
them
all
over
the
walls
the
duke
shed
his
coat
and
said
he
was
all
right
now
so
me
and
the
king
lit
out
for
the
we
got
there
in
about
a
half
an
hour
fairly
dripping
for
it
was
a
most
awful
hot
day
there
was
as
much
as
a
thousand
people
there
from
twenty
mile
around
the
woods
was
full
of
teams
and
wagons
hitched
everywheres
feeding
out
of
the
and
stomping
to
keep
off
the
flies
there
was
sheds
made
out
of
poles
and
roofed
over
with
branches
where
they
had
lemonade
and
gingerbread
to
sell
and
piles
of
watermelons
and
green
corn
and
truck
the
preaching
was
going
on
under
the
same
kinds
of
sheds
only
they
was
bigger
and
held
crowds
of
people
the
benches
was
made
out
of
outside
slabs
of
logs
with
holes
bored
in
the
round
side
to
drive
sticks
into
for
legs
they
did
have
no
backs
the
preachers
had
high
platforms
to
stand
on
at
one
end
of
the
sheds
the
women
had
on
and
some
had
frocks
some
gingham
ones
and
a
few
of
the
young
ones
had
on
calico
some
of
the
young
men
was
barefooted
and
some
of
the
children
did
have
on
any
clothes
but
just
a
shirt
some
of
the
old
women
was
knitting
and
some
of
the
young
folks
was
courting
on
the
sly
the
first
shed
we
come
to
the
preacher
was
lining
out
a
hymn
he
lined
out
two
lines
everybody
sung
it
and
it
was
kind
of
grand
to
hear
it
there
was
so
many
of
them
and
they
done
it
in
such
a
rousing
way
then
he
lined
out
two
more
for
them
to
sing
and
so
on
the
people
woke
up
more
and
more
and
sung
louder
and
louder
and
towards
the
end
some
begun
to
groan
and
some
begun
to
shout
then
the
preacher
begun
to
preach
and
begun
in
earnest
too
and
went
weaving
first
to
one
side
of
the
platform
and
then
the
other
and
then
down
over
the
front
of
it
with
his
arms
and
his
body
going
all
the
time
and
shouting
his
words
out
with
all
his
might
and
every
now
and
then
he
would
hold
up
his
bible
and
spread
it
open
and
kind
of
pass
it
around
this
way
and
that
shouting
it
the
brazen
serpent
in
the
wilderness
look
upon
it
and
live
and
people
would
shout
out
glory
and
so
he
went
on
and
the
people
groaning
and
crying
and
saying
amen
oh
come
to
the
mourners
bench
come
black
with
sin
come
sick
and
sore
come
lame
and
halt
and
blind
come
pore
and
needy
sunk
in
shame
come
all
that
worn
and
soiled
and
suffering
come
with
a
broken
spirit
come
with
a
contrite
heart
come
in
your
rags
and
sin
and
dirt
the
waters
that
cleanse
is
free
the
door
of
heaven
stands
open
oh
enter
in
and
be
at
rest
glory
glory
hallelujah
and
so
on
you
could
make
out
what
the
preacher
said
any
more
on
account
of
the
shouting
and
crying
folks
got
up
everywheres
in
the
crowd
and
worked
their
way
just
by
main
strength
to
the
bench
with
the
tears
running
down
their
faces
and
when
all
the
mourners
had
got
up
there
to
the
front
benches
in
a
crowd
they
sung
and
shouted
and
flung
themselves
down
on
the
straw
just
crazy
and
wild
well
the
first
i
knowed
the
king
got
and
you
could
hear
him
over
everybody
and
next
he
went
up
onto
the
platform
and
the
preacher
he
begged
him
to
speak
to
the
people
and
he
done
it
he
told
them
he
was
a
pirate
been
a
pirate
for
thirty
years
out
in
the
indian
ocean
and
his
crew
was
thinned
out
considerable
last
spring
in
a
fight
and
he
was
home
now
to
take
out
some
fresh
men
and
thanks
to
goodness
he
been
robbed
last
night
and
put
ashore
off
of
a
steamboat
without
a
cent
and
he
was
glad
of
it
it
was
the
blessedest
thing
that
ever
happened
to
him
because
he
was
a
changed
man
now
and
happy
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
poor
as
he
was
he
was
going
to
start
right
off
and
work
his
way
back
to
the
indian
ocean
and
put
in
the
rest
of
his
life
trying
to
turn
the
pirates
into
the
true
path
for
he
could
do
it
better
than
anybody
else
being
acquainted
with
all
pirate
crews
in
that
ocean
and
though
it
would
take
him
a
long
time
to
get
there
without
money
he
would
get
there
anyway
and
every
time
he
convinced
a
pirate
he
would
say
to
him
do
you
thank
me
you
give
me
no
credit
it
all
belongs
to
them
dear
people
in
pokeville
natural
brothers
and
benefactors
of
the
race
and
that
dear
preacher
there
the
truest
friend
a
pirate
ever
had
and
then
he
busted
into
tears
and
so
did
everybody
then
somebody
sings
out
take
up
a
collection
for
him
take
up
a
collection
well
a
half
a
dozen
made
a
jump
to
do
it
but
somebody
sings
out
let
pass
the
hat
around
then
everybody
said
it
the
preacher
too
so
the
king
went
all
through
the
crowd
with
his
hat
swabbing
his
eyes
and
blessing
the
people
and
praising
them
and
thanking
them
for
being
so
good
to
the
poor
pirates
away
off
there
and
every
little
while
the
prettiest
kind
of
girls
with
the
tears
running
down
their
cheeks
would
up
and
ask
him
would
he
let
them
kiss
him
for
to
remember
him
by
and
he
always
done
it
and
some
of
them
he
hugged
and
kissed
as
many
as
five
or
six
times
and
he
was
invited
to
stay
a
week
and
everybody
wanted
him
to
live
in
their
houses
and
said
they
think
it
was
an
honor
but
he
said
as
this
was
the
last
day
of
the
he
could
do
no
good
and
besides
he
was
in
a
sweat
to
get
to
the
indian
ocean
right
off
and
go
to
work
on
the
pirates
when
we
got
back
to
the
raft
and
he
come
to
count
up
he
found
he
had
collected
dollars
and
cents
and
then
he
had
fetched
away
a
jug
of
whisky
too
that
he
found
under
a
wagon
when
he
was
starting
home
through
the
woods
the
king
said
take
it
all
around
it
laid
over
any
day
he
ever
put
in
in
the
missionarying
line
he
said
it
war
no
use
talking
heathens
amount
to
shucks
alongside
of
pirates
to
work
a
with
the
duke
was
thinking
been
doing
pretty
well
till
the
king
come
to
show
up
but
after
that
he
did
think
so
so
much
he
had
set
up
and
printed
off
two
little
jobs
for
farmers
in
that
horse
bills
and
took
the
money
four
dollars
and
he
had
got
in
ten
dollars
worth
of
advertisements
for
the
paper
which
he
said
he
would
put
in
for
four
dollars
if
they
would
pay
in
advance
so
they
done
it
the
price
of
the
paper
was
two
dollars
a
year
but
he
took
in
three
subscriptions
for
half
a
dollar
apiece
on
condition
of
them
paying
him
in
advance
they
were
going
to
pay
in
cordwood
and
onions
as
usual
but
he
said
he
had
just
bought
the
concern
and
knocked
down
the
price
as
low
as
he
could
afford
it
and
was
going
to
run
it
for
cash
he
set
up
a
little
piece
of
poetry
which
he
made
himself
out
of
his
own
head
three
verses
kind
of
sweet
and
saddish
the
name
of
it
was
yes
crush
cold
world
this
breaking
heart
and
he
left
that
all
set
up
and
ready
to
print
in
the
paper
and
did
charge
nothing
for
it
well
he
took
in
nine
dollars
and
a
half
and
said
he
done
a
pretty
square
day
work
for
it
then
he
showed
us
another
little
job
he
printed
and
had
charged
for
because
it
was
for
us
it
had
a
picture
of
a
runaway
nigger
with
a
bundle
on
a
stick
over
his
shoulder
and
reward
under
it
the
reading
was
all
about
jim
and
just
described
him
to
a
dot
it
said
he
run
away
from
jacques
plantation
forty
mile
below
new
orleans
last
winter
and
likely
went
north
and
whoever
would
catch
him
and
send
him
back
he
could
have
the
reward
and
expenses
now
says
the
duke
after
we
can
run
in
the
daytime
if
we
want
to
whenever
we
see
anybody
coming
we
can
tie
jim
hand
and
foot
with
a
rope
and
lay
him
in
the
wigwam
and
show
this
handbill
and
say
we
captured
him
up
the
river
and
were
too
poor
to
travel
on
a
steamboat
so
we
got
this
little
raft
on
credit
from
our
friends
and
are
going
down
to
get
the
reward
handcuffs
and
chains
would
look
still
better
on
jim
but
it
would
go
well
with
the
story
of
us
being
so
poor
too
much
like
jewelry
ropes
are
the
correct
thing
we
must
preserve
the
unities
as
we
say
on
the
boards
we
all
said
the
duke
was
pretty
smart
and
there
could
be
no
trouble
about
running
daytimes
we
judged
we
could
make
miles
enough
that
night
to
get
out
of
the
reach
of
the
powwow
we
reckoned
the
duke
work
in
the
was
going
to
make
in
that
little
town
then
we
could
boom
right
along
if
we
wanted
to
we
laid
low
and
kept
still
and
never
shoved
out
till
nearly
ten
then
we
slid
by
pretty
wide
away
from
the
town
and
hoist
our
lantern
till
we
was
clear
out
of
sight
of
it
when
jim
called
me
to
take
the
watch
at
four
in
the
morning
he
says
huck
does
you
we
gwyne
to
run
acrost
any
mo
kings
on
dis
trip
no
i
says
i
reckon
not
well
says
he
dat
all
right
den
i
doan
mine
one
er
two
kings
but
dat
enough
dis
one
powerful
drunk
en
de
duke
ain
much
better
i
found
jim
had
been
trying
to
get
him
to
talk
french
so
he
could
hear
what
it
was
like
but
he
said
he
had
been
in
this
country
so
long
and
had
so
much
trouble
he
forgot
it
chapter
xxi
it
was
after
now
but
we
went
right
on
and
did
tie
up
the
king
and
the
duke
turned
out
by
and
by
looking
pretty
rusty
but
after
they
jumped
overboard
and
took
a
swim
it
chippered
them
up
a
good
deal
after
breakfast
the
king
he
took
a
seat
on
the
corner
of
the
raft
and
pulled
off
his
boots
and
rolled
up
his
britches
and
let
his
legs
dangle
in
the
water
so
as
to
be
comfortable
and
lit
his
pipe
and
went
to
getting
his
romeo
and
juliet
by
heart
when
he
had
got
it
pretty
good
him
and
the
duke
begun
to
practise
it
together
the
duke
had
to
learn
him
over
and
over
again
how
to
say
every
speech
and
he
made
him
sigh
and
put
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
after
a
while
he
said
he
done
it
pretty
well
only
he
says
you
must
bellow
out
that
way
like
a
bull
you
must
say
it
soft
and
sick
and
languishy
so
that
is
the
idea
for
juliet
a
dear
sweet
mere
child
of
a
girl
you
know
and
she
does
bray
like
a
jackass
well
next
they
got
out
a
couple
of
long
swords
that
the
duke
made
out
of
oak
laths
and
begun
to
practise
the
the
duke
called
himself
richard
iii
and
the
way
they
laid
on
and
pranced
around
the
raft
was
grand
to
see
but
by
and
by
the
king
tripped
and
fell
overboard
and
after
that
they
took
a
rest
and
had
a
talk
about
all
kinds
of
adventures
they
had
in
other
times
along
the
river
after
dinner
the
duke
says
well
capet
we
want
to
make
this
a
show
you
know
so
i
guess
we
add
a
little
more
to
it
we
want
a
little
something
to
answer
encores
with
anyway
what
onkores
bilgewater
the
duke
told
him
and
then
says
i
answer
by
doing
the
highland
fling
or
the
sailor
hornpipe
and
you
well
let
me
see
oh
i
got
it
you
can
do
soliloquy
hamlet
which
hamlet
soliloquy
you
know
the
most
celebrated
thing
in
shakespeare
ah
it
sublime
sublime
always
fetches
the
house
i
have
got
it
in
the
book
i
only
got
one
volume
but
i
reckon
i
can
piece
it
out
from
memory
i
just
walk
up
and
down
a
minute
and
see
if
i
can
call
it
back
from
recollection
vaults
so
he
went
to
marching
up
and
down
thinking
and
frowning
horrible
every
now
and
then
then
he
would
hoist
up
his
eyebrows
next
he
would
squeeze
his
hand
on
his
forehead
and
stagger
back
and
kind
of
moan
next
he
would
sigh
and
next
he
let
on
to
drop
a
tear
it
was
beautiful
to
see
him
by
and
by
he
got
it
he
told
us
to
give
attention
then
he
strikes
a
most
noble
attitude
with
one
leg
shoved
forwards
and
his
arms
stretched
away
up
and
his
head
tilted
back
looking
up
at
the
sky
and
then
he
begins
to
rip
and
rave
and
grit
his
teeth
and
after
that
all
through
his
speech
he
howled
and
spread
around
and
swelled
up
his
chest
and
just
knocked
the
spots
out
of
any
acting
ever
see
before
this
is
the
speech
i
learned
it
easy
enough
while
he
was
learning
it
to
the
king
to
be
or
not
to
be
that
is
the
bare
bodkin
that
makes
calamity
of
so
long
life
for
who
would
fardels
bear
till
birnam
wood
do
come
to
dunsinane
but
that
the
fear
of
something
after
death
murders
the
innocent
sleep
great
nature
second
course
and
makes
us
rather
sling
the
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
of
there
the
respect
must
give
us
pause
wake
duncan
with
thy
knocking
i
would
thou
couldst
for
who
would
bear
the
whips
and
scorns
of
time
the
oppressor
wrong
the
proud
man
contumely
the
law
delay
and
the
quietus
which
his
pangs
might
take
in
the
dead
waste
and
middle
of
the
night
when
churchyards
yawn
in
customary
suits
of
solemn
black
but
that
the
undiscovered
country
from
whose
bourne
no
traveler
returns
breathes
forth
contagion
on
the
world
and
thus
the
native
hue
of
resolution
like
the
poor
cat
i
the
adage
is
sicklied
with
care
and
all
the
clouds
that
lowered
our
housetops
with
this
regard
their
currents
turn
awry
and
lose
the
name
of
action
is
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wished
but
soft
you
the
fair
ophelia
ope
not
thy
ponderous
and
marble
jaws
but
get
thee
to
a
nunnery
go
well
the
old
man
he
liked
that
speech
and
he
mighty
soon
got
it
so
he
could
do
it
first
rate
it
seemed
like
he
was
just
born
for
it
and
when
he
had
his
hand
in
and
was
excited
it
was
perfectly
lovely
the
way
he
would
rip
and
tear
and
rair
up
behind
when
he
was
getting
it
off
the
first
chance
we
got
the
duke
he
had
some
printed
and
after
that
for
two
or
three
days
as
we
floated
along
the
raft
was
a
most
uncommon
lively
place
for
there
war
nothing
but
and
rehearsing
as
the
duke
called
it
going
on
all
the
time
one
morning
when
we
was
pretty
well
down
the
state
of
arkansaw
we
come
in
sight
of
a
little
town
in
a
big
bend
so
we
tied
up
about
of
a
mile
above
it
in
the
mouth
of
a
crick
which
was
shut
in
like
a
tunnel
by
the
cypress
trees
and
all
of
us
but
jim
took
the
canoe
and
went
down
there
to
see
if
there
was
any
chance
in
that
place
for
our
show
we
struck
it
mighty
lucky
there
was
going
to
be
a
circus
there
that
afternoon
and
the
was
already
beginning
to
come
in
in
all
kinds
of
old
shackly
wagons
and
on
horses
the
circus
would
leave
before
night
so
our
show
would
have
a
pretty
good
chance
the
duke
he
hired
the
and
we
went
around
and
stuck
up
our
bills
they
read

then
we
went
loafing
around
town
the
stores
and
houses
was
most
all
old
shackly
frame
concerns
that
had
ever
been
painted
they
was
set
up
three
or
four
foot
above
ground
on
stilts
so
as
to
be
out
of
reach
of
the
water
when
the
river
was
overflowed
the
houses
had
little
gardens
around
them
but
they
did
seem
to
raise
hardly
anything
in
them
but
and
sunflowers
and
and
old
boots
and
shoes
and
pieces
of
bottles
and
rags
and
tinware
the
fences
was
made
of
different
kinds
of
boards
nailed
on
at
different
times
and
they
leaned
every
which
way
and
had
gates
that
did
generly
have
but
one
hinge
a
leather
one
some
of
the
fences
had
been
whitewashed
some
time
or
another
but
the
duke
said
it
was
in
columbus
time
like
enough
there
was
generly
hogs
in
the
garden
and
people
driving
them
out
all
the
stores
was
along
one
street
they
had
white
domestic
awnings
in
front
and
the
hitched
their
horses
to
the
there
was
empty
boxes
under
the
awnings
and
loafers
roosting
on
them
all
day
long
whittling
them
with
their
barlow
knives
and
chawing
tobacco
and
gaping
and
yawning
and
stretching
a
mighty
ornery
lot
they
generly
had
on
yellow
straw
hats
most
as
wide
as
an
umbrella
but
did
wear
no
coats
nor
waistcoats
they
called
one
another
bill
and
buck
and
hank
and
joe
and
andy
and
talked
lazy
and
drawly
and
used
considerable
many
there
was
as
many
as
one
loafer
leaning
up
against
every
and
he
most
always
had
his
hands
in
his
britches
pockets
except
when
he
fetched
them
out
to
lend
a
chaw
of
tobacco
or
scratch
what
a
body
was
hearing
amongst
them
all

of

kinds
of
loafers
never

a
cent
in
the
world
nor
a
chaw
of

natural

twisted
when

generly
cut

off
with
a
knife
but
set
the
plug
in
between
their
teeth
and
gnaw
with
their
teeth
and
tug
at
the
plug
with
their
hands
till
they
get
it
in
two
then
sometimes
the
one
that
owns
the
tobacco
looks
mournful
at
it
when
it
handed
back
and
says
sarcastic
here
gim
me
the
and
you
take
the
illustration
gim
me
a
chaw
all
the
streets
and
lanes
was
just
mud
they
war
nothing
else
mud
mud
as
black
as
tar
and
nigh
about
a
foot
deep
in
some
places
and
two
or
three
inches
deep
in
the
places
the
hogs
loafed
and
grunted
around
everywheres
you
see
a
muddy
sow
and
a
litter
of
pigs
come
lazying
along
the
street
and
whollop
herself
right
down
in
the
way
where
folks
had
to
walk
around
her
and
she
stretch
out
and
shut
her
eyes
and
wave
her
ears
whilst
the
pigs
was
milking
her
and
look
as
happy
as
if
she
was
on
salary
and
pretty
soon
you
hear
a
loafer
sing
out
hi
boy
sick
him
tige
and
away
the
sow
would
go
squealing
most
horrible
with
a
dog
or
two
swinging
to
each
ear
and
three
or
four
dozen
more
and
then
you
would
see
all
the
loafers
get
up
and
watch
the
thing
out
of
sight
and
laugh
at
the
fun
and
look
grateful
for
the
noise
then
they
settle
back
again
till
there
was
a
there
could
anything
wake
them
up
all
over
and
make
them
happy
all
over
like
a
unless
it
might
be
putting
turpentine
on
a
stray
dog
and
setting
fire
to
him
or
tying
a
tin
pan
to
his
tail
and
see
him
run
himself
to
death
on
the
some
of
the
houses
was
sticking
out
over
the
bank
and
they
was
bowed
and
bent
and
about
ready
to
tumble
in
the
people
had
moved
out
of
them
the
bank
was
caved
away
under
one
corner
of
some
others
and
that
corner
was
hanging
over
people
lived
in
them
yet
but
it
was
dangersome
because
sometimes
a
strip
of
land
as
wide
as
a
house
caves
in
at
a
time
sometimes
a
belt
of
land
a
quarter
of
a
mile
deep
will
start
in
and
cave
along
and
cave
along
till
it
all
caves
into
the
river
in
one
summer
such
a
town
as
that
has
to
be
always
moving
back
and
back
and
back
because
the
river
always
gnawing
at
it
the
nearer
it
got
to
noon
that
day
the
thicker
and
thicker
was
the
wagons
and
horses
in
the
streets
and
more
coming
all
the
time
families
fetched
their
dinners
with
them
from
the
country
and
eat
them
in
the
wagons
there
was
considerable
going
on
and
i
seen
three
fights
by
and
by
somebody

out
here

old
boggs

country
for
his
little
old

about

his
saddle

was
over
fifty
year
old
and

a
very
red
face
everybody

and
sassed

and
he
sassed
back
and
said
he
attend
to
them
and
lay
them
out
in
their
regular
turns
but
he
could
wait
now
because
he
come
to

to
kill
old
colonel

and
his
motto

went
on
calling
sherburn
everything
he
could
lay
his
tongue
to
and
the
whole
street
packed
with
people
listening
and
laughing
and
going
on
by
and
by
a
man
about
and
he
was
a
heap
the
man
in
that
town
too
steps
out
of
the
store
and
the
crowd
drops
back
on
each
side
to
let
him
come
he
says
to
boggs
mighty
ca
and
slow
he
says
i
tired
of
this
but
i
endure
it
till
one
till
one
mind
no
longer
if
you
open
your
mouth
against
me
only
once
after
that
time
you
ca
travel
so
far
but
i
will
find
you
then
he
turns
and
goes
in
the
crowd
looked
mighty
sober
nobody
stirred
and
there
war
no
more
laughing
boggs
rode
off
blackguarding
sherburn
as
loud
as
he
could
yell
all
down
the
street
and
pretty
soon
back
he
comes
and
stops
before
the
store
still
keeping
it
up
some
men
crowded
around
him
and
tried
to
get
him
to
shut
up
but
he
would
they
told
him
it
would
be
one
in
about
fifteen
minutes
and
so
he
go
home
he
must
go
right
away
but
it
did
do
no
good
he
cussed
away
with
all
his
might
and
throwed
his
hat
down
in
the
mud
and
rode
over
it
and
pretty
soon
away
he
went
down
the
street
again
with
his
gray
hair
everybody
that
could
get
a
chance
at
him
tried
their
best
to
coax
him
off
of
his
horse
so
they
could
lock
him
up
and
get
him
sober
but
it
war
no
use
up
the
street
he
would
tear
again
and
give
sherburn
another
cussing
by
and
by
somebody
says
go
for
his
daughter
quick
go
for
his
daughter
sometimes
listen
to
her
if
anybody
can
persuade
him
she
can
so
somebody
started
on
a
run
i
walked
down
street
a
ways
and
stopped
in
about
five
or
ten
minutes
here
comes
boggs
again
but
not
on
his
horse
he
was
across
the
street
towards
me
bareheaded
with
a
friend
on
both
sides
of
him
of
his
arms
and
hurrying
him
along
he
was
quiet
and
looked
uneasy
and
he
war
hanging
back
any
but
was
doing
some
of
the
hurrying
himself
somebody
sings
out
boggs
i
looked
over
there
to
see
who
said
it
and
it
was
that
colonel
sherburn
he
was
standing
perfectly
still
in
the
street
and
had
a
pistol
raised
in
his
right
hand
not
aiming
it
but
holding
it
out
with
the
barrel
tilted
up
towards
the
sky
the
same
second
i
see
a
young
girl
coming
on
the
run
and
two
men
with
her
boggs
and
the
men
turned
round
to
see
who
called
him
and
when
they
see
the
pistol
the
men
jumped
to
one
side
and
the
come
down
slow
and
steady
to
a
level
both
barrels
cocked
boggs
throws
up
both
of
his
hands
and
says
o
lord
do
shoot
bang
goes
the
first
shot
and
he
staggers
back
clawing
at
the
air
bang
goes
the
second
one
and
he
tumbles
backwards
onto
the
ground
heavy
and
solid
with
his
arms
spread
out
that
young
girl
screamed
out
and
comes
rushing
and
down
she
throws
herself
on
her
father
crying
and
saying
oh
he
killed
him
he
killed
him
the
crowd
closed
up
around
them
and
shouldered
and
jammed
one
another
with
their
necks
stretched
trying
to
see
and
people
on
the
inside
trying
to
shove
them
back
and
shouting
back
back
give
him
air
give
him
air
colonel
sherburn
he
tossed
his
pistol
onto
the
ground
and
turned
around
on
his
heels
and
walked
off
they
took
boggs
to
a
little
drug
store
the
crowd
pressing
around
just
the
same
and
the
whole
town
following
and
i
rushed
and
got
a
good
place
at
the
window
where
i
was
close
to
him
and
could
see
in
they
laid
him
on
the
floor
and
put
one
large
bible
under
his
head
and
opened
another
one
and
spread
it
on
his
breast
but
they
tore
open
his
shirt
first
and
i
seen
where
one
of
the
bullets
went
in
he
made
about
a
dozen
long
gasps
his
breast
lifting
the
bible
up
when
he
drawed
in
his
breath
and
letting
it
down
again
when
he
breathed
it
out
and
after
that
he
laid
still
he
was
dead
then
they
pulled
his
daughter
away
from
him
screaming
and
crying
and
took
her
off
she
was
about
sixteen
and
very
sweet
and
gentle
looking
but
awful
pale
and
scared
well
pretty
soon
the
whole
town
was
there
squirming
and
scrouging
and
pushing
and
shoving
to
get
at
the
window
and
have
a
look
but
people
that
had
the
places
would
give
them
up
and
folks
behind
them
was
saying
all
the
time
say
now
you
looked
enough
you
fellows
right
and
fair
for
you
to
stay
thar
all
the
time
and
never
give
nobody
a
chance
other
folks
has
their
rights
as
well
as
you
there
was
considerable
jawing
back
so
i
slid
out
thinking
maybe
there
was
going
to
be
trouble
the
streets
was
full
and
everybody
was
excited
everybody
that
seen
the
shooting
was
telling
how
it
happened
and
there
was
a
big
crowd
packed
around
each
one
of
these
fellows
stretching
their
necks
and
listening
one
long
lanky
man
with
long
hair
and
a
big
white
fur
stovepipe
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
a
cane
marked
out
the
places
on
the
ground
where
boggs
stood
and
where
sherburn
stood
and
the
people
following
him
around
from
one
place
to
and
watching
everything
he
done
and
bobbing
their
heads
to
show
they
understood
and
stooping
a
little
and
resting
their
hands
on
their
thighs
to
watch
him
mark
the
places
on
the
ground
with
his
cane
and
then
he
stood
up
straight
and
stiff
where
sherburn
had
stood
frowning
and
having
his
down
over
his
eyes
and
sung
out
boggs
and
then
fetched
his
cane
down
slow
to
a
level
and
says
bang
staggered
backwards
says
bang
again
and
fell
down
flat
on
his
back
the
people
that
had
seen
the
thing
said
he
done
it
perfect
said
it
was
just
exactly
the
way
it
all
happened
then
as
much
as
a
dozen
people
got
out
their
bottles
and
treated
him
well
by
and
by
somebody
said
sherburn
ought
to
be
lynched
in
about
a
minute
everybody
was
saying
it
so
away
they
went
mad
and
yelling
and
snatching
down
every
they
come
to
to
do
the
hanging
with
chapter
xxii
they
swarmed
up
towards
sherburn
house
and
raging
like
injuns
and
everything
had
to
clear
the
way
or
get
run
over
and
tromped
to
mush
and
it
was
awful
to
see
children
was
heeling
it
ahead
of
the
mob
screaming
and
trying
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
every
window
along
the
road
was
full
of
women
heads
and
there
was
nigger
boys
in
every
tree
and
bucks
and
wenches
looking
over
every
fence
and
as
soon
as
the
mob
would
get
nearly
to
them
they
would
break
and
skaddle
back
out
of
reach
lots
of
the
women
and
girls
was
crying
and
taking
on
scared
most
to
death
they
swarmed
up
in
front
of
sherburn
palings
as
thick
as
they
could
jam
together
and
you
could
hear
yourself
think
for
the
noise
it
was
a
little
yard
some
sung
out
tear
down
the
fence
tear
down
the
fence
then
there
was
a
racket
of
ripping
and
tearing
and
smashing
and
down
she
goes
and
the
front
wall
of
the
crowd
begins
to
roll
in
like
a
wave
just
then
sherburn
steps
out
onto
the
roof
of
his
little
front
porch
with
a
gun
in
his
hand
and
takes
his
stand
perfectly
ca
and
deliberate
not
saying
a
word
the
racket
stopped
and
the
wave
sucked
back
sherburn
never
said
a
word
just
stood
there
looking
down
the
stillness
was
awful
creepy
and
uncomfortable
sherburn
run
his
eye
slow
along
the
crowd
and
wherever
it
struck
the
people
tried
a
little
to
outgaze
him
but
they
could
they
dropped
their
eyes
and
looked
sneaky
then
pretty
soon
sherburn
sort
of
laughed
not
the
pleasant
kind
but
the
kind
that
makes
you
feel
like
when
you
are
eating
bread
that
got
sand
in
it
then
he
says
slow
and
scornful
the
idea
of
lynching
anybody
it
amusing
the
idea
of
you
thinking
you
had
pluck
enough
to
lynch
a
because
you
brave
enough
to
tar
and
feather
poor
friendless
women
that
come
along
here
did
that
make
you
think
you
had
grit
enough
to
lay
your
hands
on
a
why
a
safe
in
the
hands
of
ten
thousand
of
your
kind
as
long
as
it
daytime
and
you
not
behind
him
do
i
know
you
i
know
you
clear
through
i
was
born
and
raised
in
the
south
and
i
lived
in
the
north
so
i
know
the
average
all
around
the
average
man
a
coward
in
the
north
he
lets
anybody
walk
over
him
that
wants
to
and
goes
home
and
prays
for
a
humble
spirit
to
bear
it
in
the
south
one
man
all
by
himself
has
stopped
a
stage
full
of
men
in
the
daytime
and
robbed
the
lot
your
newspapers
call
you
a
brave
people
so
much
that
you
think
you
are
braver
than
any
other
people
whereas
you
just
brave
and
no
braver
why
do
your
juries
hang
murderers
because
they
afraid
the
man
friends
will
shoot
them
in
the
back
in
the
dark
and
it
just
what
they
do
so
they
always
acquit
and
then
a
goes
in
the
night
with
a
hundred
masked
cowards
at
his
back
and
lynches
the
rascal
your
mistake
is
that
you
did
bring
a
man
with
you
that
one
mistake
and
the
other
is
that
you
did
come
in
the
dark
and
fetch
your
masks
you
brought
of
a
man
buck
harkness
there
and
if
you
had
had
him
to
start
you
you
taken
it
out
in
blowing
you
did
want
to
come
the
average
man
do
like
trouble
and
danger
do
like
trouble
and
danger
but
if
only
a
man
like
buck
harkness
there
shouts
him
lynch
him
afraid
to
back
down
afraid
you
be
found
out
to
be
what
you
are
and
so
you
raise
a
yell
and
hang
yourselves
onto
that
and
come
raging
up
here
swearing
what
big
things
you
going
to
do
the
pitifulest
thing
out
is
a
mob
what
an
army
is
a
mob
they
do
fight
with
courage
that
born
in
them
but
with
courage
that
borrowed
from
their
mass
and
from
their
officers
but
a
mob
without
any
at
the
head
of
it
is
pitifulness
now
the
thing
for
to
do
is
to
droop
your
tails
and
go
home
and
crawl
in
a
hole
if
any
real
lynching
going
to
be
done
it
will
be
done
in
the
dark
southern
fashion
and
when
they
come
they
bring
their
masks
and
fetch
a
along
now
and
take
your
with
you
tossing
his
gun
up
across
his
left
arm
and
cocking
it
when
he
says
this
the
crowd
washed
back
sudden
and
then
broke
all
apart
and
went
tearing
off
every
which
way
and
buck
harkness
he
heeled
it
after
them
looking
tolerable
cheap
i
could
stayed
if
i
wanted
to
but
i
did
want
to
i
went
to
the
circus
and
loafed
around
the
back
side
till
the
watchman
went
by
and
then
dived
in
under
the
tent
i
had
my
gold
piece
and
some
other
money
but
i
reckoned
i
better
save
it
because
there
ai
no
telling
how
soon
you
are
going
to
need
it
away
from
home
and
amongst
strangers
that
way
you
ca
be
too
careful
i
opposed
to
spending
money
on
circuses
when
there
ai
no
other
way
but
there
ai
no
use
in
it
on
them
it
was
a
real
bully
circus
it
was
the
splendidest
sight
that
ever
was
when
they
all
come
riding
in
two
and
two
and
gentleman
and
lady
side
by
side
the
men
just
in
their
drawers
and
undershirts
and
no
shoes
nor
stirrups
and
resting
their
hands
on
their
thighs
easy
and
comfortable
there
must
been
twenty
of
them
and
every
lady
with
a
lovely
complexion
and
perfectly
beautiful
and
looking
just
like
a
gang
of
real
queens
and
dressed
in
clothes
that
cost
millions
of
dollars
and
just
littered
with
diamonds
it
was
a
powerful
fine
sight
i
never
see
anything
so
lovely
and
then
one
by
one
they
got
up
and
stood
and
went
around
the
ring
so
gentle
and
wavy
and
graceful
the
men
looking
ever
so
tall
and
airy
and
straight
with
their
heads
bobbing
and
skimming
along
away
up
there
under
the
and
every
lady
dress
flapping
soft
and
silky
around
her
hips
and
she
looking
like
the
most
loveliest
parasol
and
then
faster
and
faster
they
went
all
of
them
dancing
first
one
foot
out
in
the
air
and
then
the
other
the
horses
leaning
more
and
more
and
the
ringmaster
going
round
and
round
the
center
pole
cracking
his
whip
and
shouting
hi
hi
and
the
clown
cracking
jokes
behind
him
and
by
and
by
all
hands
dropped
the
reins
and
every
lady
put
her
knuckles
on
her
hips
and
every
gentleman
folded
his
arms
and
then
how
the
horses
did
lean
over
and
hump
themselves
and
so
one
after
the
other
they
all
skipped
off
into
the
ring
and
made
the
sweetest
bow
i
ever
see
and
then
scampered
out
and
everybody
clapped
their
hands
and
went
just
about
wild
well
all
through
the
circus
they
done
the
most
astonishing
things
and
all
the
time
that
clown
carried
on
so
it
most
killed
the
people
the
ringmaster
could
ever
say
a
word
to
him
but
he
was
back
at
him
quick
as
a
wink
with
the
funniest
things
a
body
ever
said
and
how
he
ever
think
of
so
many
of
them
and
so
sudden
and
so
pat
was
what
i
could
no
way
understand
why
i
could
thought
of
them
in
a
year
and
by
and
by
a
drunken
man
tried
to
get
into
the
ring
said
he
wanted
to
ride
said
he
could
ride
as
well
as
anybody
that
ever
was
they
argued
and
tried
to
keep
him
out
but
he
would
listen
and
the
whole
show
come
to
a
standstill
then
the
people
begun
to
holler
at
him
and
make
fun
of
him
and
that
made
him
mad
and
he
begun
to
rip
and
tear
so
that
stirred
up
the
people
and
a
lot
of
men
begun
to
pile
down
off
of
the
benches
and
swarm
toward
the
ring
saying
knock
him
down
throw
him
out
and
one
or
two
women
begun
to
scream
so
then
the
ringmaster
he
made
a
little
speech
and
said
he
hoped
there
would
be
no
disturbance
and
if
the
man
would
promise
he
would
make
no
more
trouble
he
would
let
him
ride
if
he
thought
he
could
stay
on
the
horse
so
everybody
laughed
and
said
all
right
and
the
man
got
on
the
minute
he
was
on
the
horse
begun
to
rip
and
tear
and
jump
and
cavort
around
with
two
circus
men
hanging
on
to
his
bridle
trying
to
hold
him
and
the
drunk
man
hanging
on
to
his
neck
and
his
heels
flying
in
the
air
every
jump
and
the
whole
crowd
of
people
standing
up
shouting
and
laughing
till
tears
rolled
down
and
at
last
sure
enough
all
the
circus
men
could
do
the
horse
broke
loose
and
away
he
went
like
the
very
nation
round
and
round
the
ring
with
that
sot
laying
down
on
him
and
hanging
to
his
neck
with
first
one
leg
hanging
most
to
the
ground
on
one
side
and
then
one
on
side
and
the
people
just
crazy
it
war
funny
to
me
though
i
was
all
of
a
tremble
to
see
his
danger
but
pretty
soon
he
struggled
up
astraddle
and
grabbed
the
bridle
this
way
and
that
and
the
next
minute
he
sprung
up
and
dropped
the
bridle
and
stood
and
the
horse
like
a
house
afire
too
he
just
stood
up
there
around
as
easy
and
comfortable
as
if
he
war
ever
drunk
in
his
life
and
then
he
begun
to
pull
off
his
clothes
and
sling
them
he
shed
them
so
thick
they
kind
of
clogged
up
the
air
and
altogether
he
shed
seventeen
suits
and
then
there
he
was
slim
and
handsome
and
dressed
the
gaudiest
and
prettiest
you
ever
saw
and
he
lit
into
that
horse
with
his
whip
and
made
him
fairly
hum
and
finally
skipped
off
and
made
his
bow
and
danced
off
to
the
and
everybody
just
with
pleasure
and
astonishment
then
the
ringmaster
he
see
how
he
had
been
fooled
and
he
the
sickest
ringmaster
you
ever
see
i
reckon
why
it
was
one
of
his
own
men
he
had
got
up
that
joke
all
out
of
his
own
head
and
never
let
on
to
nobody
well
i
felt
sheepish
enough
to
be
took
in
so
but
i
would
been
in
that
ringmaster
place
not
for
a
thousand
dollars
i
do
know
there
may
be
bullier
circuses
than
what
that
one
was
but
i
never
struck
them
yet
anyways
it
was
plenty
good
enough
for
and
wherever
i
run
across
it
it
can
have
all
of
custom
every
time
well
that
night
we
had
show
but
there
war
only
about
twelve
people
there
just
enough
to
pay
expenses
and
they
laughed
all
the
time
and
that
made
the
duke
mad
and
everybody
left
anyway
before
the
show
was
over
but
one
boy
which
was
asleep
so
the
duke
said
these
arkansaw
lunkheads
could
come
up
to
shakespeare
what
they
wanted
was
low
comedy
and
maybe
something
ruther
worse
than
low
comedy
he
reckoned
he
said
he
could
size
their
style
so
next
morning
he
got
some
big
sheets
of
and
some
black
paint
and
drawed
off
some
handbills
and
stuck
them
up
all
over
the
village
the
bills
said
at
the
court
house
for
nights
only
david
garrick
the
younger
and
edmund
kean
the
elder
of
the
london
and
continental
theatres
in
their
thrilling
tragedy
of
the
king
cameleopard
or
the
royal
nonesuch
then
at
the
bottom
was
the
biggest
line
of
all
which
said
ladies
and
children
not
admitted
there
says
he
if
that
line
do
fetch
them
i
do
know
arkansaw
chapter
xxiii
i
well
all
day
him
and
the
king
was
hard
at
it
rigging
up
a
stage
and
a
curtain
and
a
row
of
candles
for
footlights
and
that
night
the
house
was
jam
full
of
men
in
no
time
when
the
place
could
hold
no
more
the
duke
he
quit
tending
door
and
went
around
the
back
way
and
come
onto
the
stage
and
stood
up
before
the
curtain
and
made
a
little
speech
and
praised
up
this
tragedy
and
said
it
was
the
most
thrillingest
one
that
ever
was
and
so
he
went
on
about
the
tragedy
and
about
edmund
kean
the
elder
which
was
to
play
the
main
principal
part
in
it
and
at
last
when
he
got
expectations
up
high
enough
he
rolled
up
the
curtain
and
the
next
minute
the
king
come
out
on
all
fours
naked
and
he
was
painted
all
over
all
sorts
of
colors
as
splendid
as
a
rainbow
and
but
never
mind
the
rest
of
his
outfit
it
was
just
wild
but
it
was
awful
funny
the
people
most
killed
themselves
laughing
and
when
the
king
got
done
capering
and
capered
off
behind
the
scenes
they
roared
and
clapped
and
stormed
and
till
he
come
back
and
done
it
over
again
and
after
that
they
made
him
do
it
another
time
well
it
would
make
a
cow
laugh
to
see
the
shines
that
old
idiot
cut
then
the
duke
he
lets
the
curtain
down
and
bows
to
the
people
and
says
the
great
tragedy
will
be
performed
only
two
nights
more
on
accounts
of
pressing
london
engagements
where
the
seats
is
all
sold
already
for
it
in
drury
lane
and
then
he
makes
them
another
bow
and
says
if
he
has
succeeded
in
pleasing
them
and
instructing
them
he
will
be
deeply
obleeged
if
they
will
mention
it
to
their
friends
and
get
them
to
come
and
see
it
twenty
people
sings
out
what
is
it
over
is
that
the
duke
says
yes
then
there
was
a
fine
time
everybody
sings
out
sold
and
rose
up
mad
and
was
for
that
stage
and
them
tragedians
but
a
big
man
jumps
up
on
a
bench
and
shouts
hold
on
just
a
word
gentlemen
they
stopped
to
listen
we
are
sold
mighty
badly
sold
but
we
do
want
to
be
the
of
this
whole
town
i
reckon
and
never
hear
the
last
of
this
thing
as
long
as
we
live
what
we
want
is
to
go
out
of
here
quiet
and
talk
this
show
up
and
sell
the
of
the
town
then
we
all
be
in
the
same
boat
ai
that
sensible
you
bet
it
is
the
jedge
is
right
everybody
sings
out
all
right
then
not
a
word
about
any
sell
go
along
home
and
advise
everybody
to
come
and
see
the
tragedy
next
day
you
could
hear
nothing
around
that
town
but
how
splendid
that
show
was
house
was
jammed
again
that
night
and
we
sold
this
crowd
the
same
way
when
me
and
the
king
and
the
duke
got
home
to
the
raft
we
all
had
a
supper
and
by
and
by
about
midnight
they
made
jim
and
me
back
her
out
and
float
her
down
the
middle
of
the
river
and
fetch
her
in
and
hide
her
about
two
mile
below
town
the
third
night
the
house
was
crammed
again
and
they
this
time
but
people
that
was
at
the
show
the
other
two
nights
i
stood
by
the
duke
at
the
door
and
i
see
that
every
man
that
went
in
had
his
pockets
bulging
or
something
muffled
up
under
his
coat
and
i
see
it
war
no
perfumery
neither
not
by
a
long
sight
i
smelt
sickly
eggs
by
the
barrel
and
rotten
cabbages
and
such
things
and
if
i
know
the
signs
of
a
dead
cat
being
around
and
i
bet
i
do
there
was
of
them
went
in
i
shoved
in
there
for
a
minute
but
it
was
too
various
for
me
i
could
stand
it
well
when
the
place
could
hold
no
more
people
the
duke
he
give
a
fellow
a
quarter
and
told
him
to
tend
door
for
him
a
minute
and
then
he
started
around
for
the
stage
door
i
after
him
but
the
minute
we
turned
the
corner
and
was
in
the
dark
he
says
walk
fast
now
till
you
get
away
from
the
houses
and
then
shin
for
the
raft
like
the
dickens
was
after
you
i
done
it
and
he
done
the
same
we
struck
the
raft
at
the
same
time
and
in
less
than
two
seconds
we
was
gliding
all
dark
and
still
and
edging
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
nobody
saying
a
word
i
reckoned
the
poor
king
was
in
for
a
gaudy
time
of
it
with
the
audience
but
nothing
of
the
sort
pretty
soon
he
crawls
out
from
under
the
wigwam
and
says
well
how
the
old
thing
pan
out
this
time
duke
he
had
been
at
all
we
never
showed
a
light
till
we
was
about
ten
mile
below
the
village
then
we
lit
up
and
had
a
supper
and
the
king
and
the
duke
fairly
laughed
their
bones
loose
over
the
way
they
served
them
people
the
duke
says
greenhorns
flatheads
i
knew
the
first
house
would
keep
mum
and
let
the
rest
of
the
town
get
roped
in
and
i
knew
they
lay
for
us
the
third
night
and
consider
it
was
turn
now
well
it
their
turn
and
i
give
something
to
know
how
much
they
take
for
it
i
just
like
to
know
how
they
putting
in
their
opportunity
they
can
turn
it
into
a
picnic
if
they
want
to
they
brought
plenty
provisions
them
rapscallions
took
in
four
hundred
and
dollars
in
that
three
nights
i
never
see
money
hauled
in
by
the
like
that
before
by
and
by
when
they
was
asleep
and
snoring
jim
says
do
it
you
de
way
dem
kings
carries
on
huck
no
i
says
it
do
why
do
it
huck
well
it
do
because
it
in
the
breed
i
reckon
they
all
alike
but
huck
dese
kings
o
ourn
is
reglar
rapscallions
dat
jist
what
dey
is
dey
reglar
rapscallions
well
that
what
i
all
kings
is
mostly
rapscallions
as
fur
as
i
can
make
out
is
dat
so
you
read
about
them
once
you
see
look
at
henry
the
eight
this
a
superintendent
to
and
look
at
charles
second
and
louis
fourteen
and
louis
fifteen
and
james
second
and
edward
second
and
richard
third
and
forty
more
besides
all
them
saxon
heptarchies
that
used
to
rip
around
so
in
old
times
and
raise
cain
my
you
ought
to
seen
old
henry
the
eight
when
he
was
in
bloom
he
a
blossom
he
used
to
marry
a
new
wife
every
day
and
chop
off
her
head
next
morning
and
he
would
do
it
just
as
indifferent
as
if
he
was
ordering
up
eggs
up
nell
gwynn
he
says
they
fetch
her
up
next
morning
off
her
head
and
they
chop
it
off
up
jane
shore
he
says
and
up
she
comes
next
morning
off
her
head
and
they
chop
it
off
up
fair
rosamun
fair
rosamun
answers
the
bell
next
morning
off
her
head
and
he
made
every
one
of
them
tell
him
a
tale
every
night
and
he
kept
that
up
till
he
had
hogged
a
thousand
and
one
tales
that
way
and
then
he
put
them
all
in
a
book
and
called
it
domesday
book
which
was
a
good
name
and
stated
the
case
you
do
know
kings
jim
but
i
know
them
and
this
old
rip
of
ourn
is
one
of
the
cleanest
i
struck
in
history
well
henry
he
takes
a
notion
he
wants
to
get
up
some
trouble
with
this
country
how
does
he
go
at
it
give
notice
give
the
country
a
show
no
all
of
a
sudden
he
heaves
all
the
tea
in
boston
harbor
overboard
and
whacks
out
a
declaration
of
independence
and
dares
them
to
come
on
that
was
style
he
never
give
anybody
a
chance
he
had
suspicions
of
his
father
the
duke
of
wellington
well
what
did
he
do
ask
him
to
show
up
no
drownded
him
in
a
butt
of
mamsey
like
a
cat
people
left
money
laying
around
where
he
was
what
did
he
do
he
collared
it
he
contracted
to
do
a
thing
and
you
paid
him
and
did
set
down
there
and
see
that
he
done
it
what
did
he
do
he
always
done
the
other
thing
he
opened
his
mouth
what
then
if
he
did
shut
it
up
powerful
quick
he
lose
a
lie
every
time
that
the
kind
of
a
bug
henry
was
and
if
we
had
him
along
of
our
kings
he
fooled
that
town
a
heap
worse
than
ourn
done
i
do
say
that
ourn
is
lambs
because
they
ai
when
you
come
right
down
to
the
cold
facts
but
they
nothing
to
old
ram
anyway
all
i
say
is
kings
is
kings
and
you
got
to
make
allowances
take
them
all
around
they
a
mighty
ornery
lot
it
the
way
they
raised
but
dis
one
do
so
like
de
nation
huck
well
they
all
do
jim
we
ca
help
the
way
a
king
smells
history
do
tell
no
way
now
de
duke
he
a
tolerble
likely
man
in
some
ways
yes
a
duke
different
but
not
very
different
this
one
a
middling
hard
lot
for
a
duke
when
he
drunk
there
ai
no
man
could
tell
him
from
a
king
well
anyways
i
doan
hanker
for
no
mo
un
um
huck
dese
is
all
i
kin
stan
it
the
way
i
feel
too
jim
but
we
got
them
on
our
hands
and
we
got
to
remember
what
they
are
and
make
allowances
sometimes
i
wish
we
could
hear
of
a
country
that
out
of
kings
what
was
the
use
to
tell
jim
these
war
real
kings
and
dukes
it
would
done
no
good
and
besides
it
was
just
as
i
said
you
could
tell
them
from
the
real
kind
i
went
to
sleep
and
jim
did
call
me
when
it
was
my
turn
he
often
done
that
when
i
waked
up
just
at
daybreak
he
was
sitting
there
with
his
head
down
betwixt
his
knees
moaning
and
mourning
to
himself
i
did
take
notice
nor
let
on
i
knowed
what
it
was
about
he
was
thinking
about
his
wife
and
his
children
away
up
yonder
and
he
was
low
and
homesick
because
he
had
ever
been
away
from
home
before
in
his
life
and
i
do
believe
he
cared
just
as
much
for
his
people
as
white
folks
does
for
it
do
seem
natural
but
i
reckon
so
he
was
often
moaning
and
mourning
that
way
nights
when
he
judged
i
was
asleep
and
saying
po
little
po

chapter
xxiv
next
day
towards
night
we
laid
up
under
a
little
willow
towhead
out
in
the
middle
where
there
was
a
village
on
each
side
of
the
river
and
the
duke
and
the
king
begun
to
lay
out
a
plan
for
working
them
towns
jim
he
spoke
to
the
duke
and
said
he
hoped
it
would
take
but
a
few
hours
because
it
got
mighty
heavy
and
tiresome
to
him
when
he
had
to
lay
all
day
in
the
wigwam
tied
with
the
rope
you
see
when
we
left
him
all
alone
we
had
to
tie
him
because
if
anybody
happened
on
to
him
all
by
himself
and
not
tied
it
would
look
much
like
he
was
a
runaway
nigger
you
know
so
the
duke
said
it
kind
of
hard
to
have
to
lay
roped
all
day
and
he
cipher
out
some
way
to
get
around
it
he
was
uncommon
bright
the
duke
was
and
he
soon
struck
it
he
dressed
jim
up
in
king
lear
outfit
it
was
a
long
gown
and
a
white
wig
and
whiskers
and
then
he
took
his
theater
paint
and
painted
jim
face
and
hands
and
ears
and
neck
all
over
a
dead
dull
solid
blue
like
a
man
that
been
drownded
nine
days
blamed
if
he
war
the
outrage
i
ever
see
then
the
duke
took
and
wrote
out
a
sign
on
a
shingle
so
arab
but
harmless
when
not
out
of
his
and
he
nailed
that
shingle
to
a
lath
and
stood
the
lath
up
four
or
five
foot
in
front
of
the
wigwam
jim
was
satisfied
he
said
it
was
a
sight
better
than
lying
tied
a
couple
of
years
every
day
and
trembling
all
over
every
time
there
was
a
sound
the
duke
told
him
to
make
himself
free
and
easy
and
if
anybody
ever
come
meddling
around
he
must
hop
out
of
the
wigwam
and
carry
on
a
little
and
fetch
a
howl
or
two
like
a
wild
beast
and
he
reckoned
they
would
light
out
and
leave
him
alone
which
was
sound
enough
judgment
but
you
take
the
average
man
and
he
would
wait
for
him
to
howl
why
he
did
only
look
like
he
was
dead
he
looked
considerable
more
than
that
these
rapscallions
wanted
to
try
the
nonesuch
again
because
there
was
so
much
money
in
it
but
they
judged
it
would
be
safe
because
maybe
the
news
might
worked
along
down
by
this
time
they
hit
no
project
that
suited
exactly
so
at
last
the
duke
said
he
reckoned
he
lay
off
and
work
his
brains
an
hour
or
two
and
see
if
he
could
put
up
something
on
the
arkansaw
village
and
the
king
he
allowed
he
would
drop
over
to
village
without
any
plan
but
just
trust
in
providence
to
lead
him
the
profitable
way
meaning
the
devil
i
reckon
we
had
all
bought
store
clothes
where
we
stopped
last
and
now
the
king
put
on
and
he
told
me
to
put
mine
on
i
done
it
of
course
the
king
duds
was
all
black
and
he
did
look
real
swell
and
starchy
i
never
knowed
how
clothes
could
change
a
body
before
why
before
he
looked
like
the
orneriest
old
rip
that
ever
was
but
now
when
he
take
off
his
new
white
beaver
and
make
a
bow
and
do
a
smile
he
looked
that
grand
and
good
and
pious
that
you
say
he
had
walked
right
out
of
the
ark
and
maybe
was
old
leviticus
himself
jim
cleaned
up
the
canoe
and
i
got
my
paddle
ready
there
was
a
big
steamboat
laying
at
the
shore
away
up
under
the
point
about
three
mile
above
the
town
been
there
a
couple
of
hours
taking
on
freight
says
the
king
seein
how
i
dressed
i
reckon
maybe
i
better
arrive
down
from
louis
or
cincinnati
or
some
other
big
place
go
for
the
steamboat
huckleberry
we
come
down
to
the
village
on
her
i
did
have
to
be
ordered
twice
to
go
and
take
a
steamboat
ride
i
fetched
the
shore
a
half
a
mile
above
the
village
and
then
went
scooting
along
the
bluff
bank
in
the
easy
water
pretty
soon
we
come
to
a
nice
young
country
jake
setting
on
a
log
swabbing
the
sweat
off
of
his
face
for
it
was
powerful
warm
weather
and
he
had
a
couple
of
big
by
him
run
her
nose
inshore
says
the
king
i
done
it
wher
you
bound
for
young
man
for
the
steamboat
going
to
orleans
git
aboard
says
the
king
hold
on
a
minute
my
servant
you
with
them
bags
jump
out
and
the
gentleman
adolphus
meaning
me
i
see
i
done
so
and
then
we
all
three
started
on
again
the
young
chap
was
mighty
thankful
said
it
was
tough
work
toting
his
baggage
such
weather
he
asked
the
king
where
he
was
going
and
the
king
told
him
he
come
down
the
river
and
landed
at
the
other
village
this
morning
and
now
he
was
going
up
a
few
mile
to
see
an
old
friend
on
a
farm
up
there
the
young
fellow
says
when
i
first
see
you
i
says
to
myself
wilks
sure
and
he
come
mighty
near
getting
here
in
time
but
then
i
says
again
i
reckon
it
ai
him
or
else
he
would
be
paddling
up
the
river
you
him
are
you
no
my
name
blodgett
elexander
blodgett
elexander
blodgett
i
i
must
say
as
i
one
o
the
lord
poor
servants
but
still
i
jist
as
able
to
be
sorry
for
wilks
for
not
arriving
in
time
all
the
same
if
he
missed
anything
by
it
which
i
hope
he
has
well
he
do
miss
any
property
by
it
because
he
get
that
all
right
but
he
missed
seeing
his
brother
peter
die
which
he
mind
nobody
can
tell
as
to
that
but
his
brother
would
give
anything
in
this
world
to
see
before
he
died
never
talked
about
nothing
else
all
these
three
weeks
had
seen
him
since
they
was
boys
together
and
had
ever
seen
his
brother
william
at
all
the
deef
and
dumb
one
william
ai
more
than
thirty
or
peter
and
george
were
the
only
ones
that
come
out
here
george
was
the
married
brother
him
and
his
wife
both
died
last
year
harvey
and
william
the
only
ones
that
left
now
and
as
i
was
saying
they
have
got
here
in
time
did
anybody
send
word
oh
yes
a
month
or
two
ago
when
peter
was
first
took
because
peter
said
then
that
he
sorter
felt
like
he
war
going
to
get
well
this
time
you
see
he
was
pretty
old
and
george
was
too
young
to
be
much
company
for
him
except
mary
jane
the
one
and
so
he
was
kinder
lonesome
after
george
and
his
wife
died
and
seem
to
care
much
to
live
he
most
desperately
wanted
to
see
harvey
and
william
too
for
that
matter
because
he
was
one
of
them
kind
that
ca
bear
to
make
a
will
he
left
a
letter
behind
for
harvey
and
said
he
told
in
it
where
his
money
was
hid
and
how
he
wanted
the
rest
of
the
property
divided
up
so
george
would
be
all
right
for
george
did
leave
nothing
and
that
letter
was
all
they
could
get
him
to
put
a
pen
to
why
do
you
reckon
harvey
do
come
wher
does
he
live
oh
he
lives
in
england
sheffield
preaches
there
has
ever
been
in
this
country
he
has
had
any
too
much
time
and
besides
he
might
got
the
letter
at
all
you
know
too
bad
too
bad
he
could
lived
to
see
his
brothers
poor
soul
you
going
to
orleans
you
say
yes
but
that
ai
only
a
part
of
it
i
going
in
a
ship
next
wednesday
for
ryo
janeero
where
my
uncle
lives
it
a
pretty
long
journey
but
it
be
lovely
i
wisht
i
was
is
mary
jane
the
oldest
how
old
is
the
others
mary
jane
nineteen
susan
fifteen
and
joanna
about
fourteen
that
the
one
that
gives
herself
to
good
works
and
has
a
poor
things
to
be
left
alone
in
the
cold
world
so
well
they
could
be
worse
off
old
peter
had
friends
and
they
going
to
let
them
come
to
no
harm
there
hobson
the
preacher
and
deacon
lot
hovey
and
ben
rucker
and
abner
shackleford
and
levi
bell
the
lawyer
and
robinson
and
their
wives
and
the
widow
bartley
and
well
there
a
lot
of
them
but
these
are
the
ones
that
peter
was
thickest
with
and
used
to
write
about
sometimes
when
he
wrote
home
so
harvey
know
where
to
look
for
friends
when
he
gets
here
well
the
old
man
went
on
asking
questions
till
he
just
fairly
emptied
that
young
fellow
blamed
if
he
did
inquire
about
everybody
and
everything
in
that
blessed
town
and
all
about
the
wilkses
and
about
peter
business
which
was
a
tanner
and
about
george
which
was
a
carpenter
and
about
harvey
which
was
a
dissentering
minister
and
so
on
and
so
on
then
he
says
what
did
you
want
to
walk
all
the
way
up
to
the
steamboat
for
because
she
a
big
orleans
boat
and
i
was
afeard
she
might
stop
there
when
they
deep
they
wo
stop
for
a
hail
a
cincinnati
boat
will
but
this
is
a
louis
one
was
peter
wilks
well
off
oh
yes
pretty
well
off
he
had
houses
and
land
and
it
reckoned
he
left
three
or
four
thousand
in
cash
hid
up
when
did
you
say
he
died
i
did
say
but
it
was
last
night
funeral
likely
yes
the
middle
of
the
day
well
it
all
terrible
sad
but
we
all
got
to
go
one
time
or
another
so
what
we
want
to
do
is
to
be
prepared
then
we
all
right
yes
sir
it
the
best
way
ma
used
to
always
say
that
when
we
struck
the
boat
she
was
about
done
loading
and
pretty
soon
she
got
off
the
king
never
said
nothing
about
going
aboard
so
i
lost
my
ride
after
all
when
the
boat
was
gone
the
king
made
me
paddle
up
another
mile
to
a
lonesome
place
and
then
he
got
ashore
and
says
now
hustle
back
right
off
and
fetch
the
duke
up
here
and
the
new
and
if
he
gone
over
to
side
go
over
there
and
git
him
and
tell
him
to
git
himself
up
regardless
shove
along
now
i
see
what
was
up
to
but
i
never
said
nothing
of
course
when
i
got
back
with
the
duke
we
hid
the
canoe
and
then
they
set
down
on
a
log
and
the
king
told
him
everything
just
like
the
young
fellow
had
said
it
every
last
word
of
it
and
all
the
time
he
was
it
he
tried
to
talk
like
an
englishman
and
he
done
it
pretty
well
too
for
a
slouch
i
ca
imitate
him
and
so
i
ai
to
try
to
but
he
really
done
it
pretty
good
then
he
says
how
are
you
on
the
deef
and
dumb
bilgewater
the
duke
said
leave
him
alone
for
that
said
he
had
played
a
deef
and
dumb
person
on
the
histrionic
boards
so
then
they
waited
for
a
steamboat
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
a
couple
of
little
boats
come
along
but
they
did
come
from
high
enough
up
the
river
but
at
last
there
was
a
big
one
and
they
hailed
her
she
sent
out
her
yawl
and
we
went
aboard
and
she
was
from
cincinnati
and
when
they
found
we
only
wanted
to
go
four
or
five
mile
they
was
booming
mad
and
gave
us
a
cussing
and
said
they
would
land
us
but
the
king
was
ca
he
says
if
gentlemen
kin
afford
to
pay
a
dollar
a
mile
apiece
to
be
took
on
and
put
off
in
a
yawl
a
steamboat
kin
afford
to
carry
ca
it
so
they
softened
down
and
said
it
was
all
right
and
when
we
got
to
the
village
they
yawled
us
ashore
about
two
dozen
men
flocked
down
when
they
see
the
yawl
and
when
the
king
says
kin
any
of
you
gentlemen
tell
me
wher
peter
wilks
lives
they
give
a
glance
at
one
another
and
nodded
their
heads
as
much
as
to
say
what
i
tell
you
then
one
of
them
says
kind
of
soft
and
gentle
i
sorry
sir
but
the
best
we
can
do
is
to
tell
you
where
he
live
yesterday
evening
sudden
as
winking
the
ornery
old
cretur
went
all
to
smash
and
fell
up
against
the
man
and
put
his
chin
on
his
shoulder
and
cried
down
his
back
and
says
alas
alas
our
poor
brother
gone
and
we
never
got
to
see
him
oh
it
too
too
hard
then
he
turns
around
blubbering
and
makes
a
lot
of
idiotic
signs
to
the
duke
on
his
hands
and
blamed
if
he
did
drop
a
and
bust
out
if
they
war
the
beatenest
lot
them
two
frauds
that
ever
i
struck
well
the
men
gathered
around
and
sympathized
with
them
and
said
all
sorts
of
kind
things
to
them
and
carried
their
up
the
hill
for
them
and
let
them
lean
on
them
and
cry
and
told
the
king
all
about
his
brother
last
moments
and
the
king
he
told
it
all
over
again
on
his
hands
to
the
duke
and
both
of
them
took
on
about
that
dead
tanner
like
they
lost
the
twelve
disciples
well
if
ever
i
struck
anything
like
it
i
a
nigger
it
was
enough
to
make
a
body
ashamed
of
the
human
race
chapter
xxv
the
news
was
all
over
town
in
two
minutes
and
you
could
see
the
people
tearing
down
on
the
run
from
every
which
way
some
of
them
putting
on
their
coats
as
they
come
pretty
soon
we
was
in
the
middle
of
a
crowd
and
the
noise
of
the
tramping
was
like
a
soldier
march
the
windows
and
dooryards
was
full
and
every
minute
somebody
would
say
over
a
fence
is
it
and
somebody
trotting
along
with
the
gang
would
answer
back
and
say
you
bet
it
is
when
we
got
to
the
house
the
street
in
front
of
it
was
packed
and
the
three
girls
was
standing
in
the
door
mary
jane
but
that
do
make
no
difference
she
was
most
awful
beautiful
and
her
face
and
her
eyes
was
all
lit
up
like
glory
she
was
so
glad
her
uncles
was
come
the
king
he
spread
his
arms
and
mary
jane
she
jumped
for
them
and
the
jumped
for
the
duke
and
there
they
it
everybody
most
leastways
women
cried
for
joy
to
see
them
meet
again
at
last
and
have
such
good
times
then
the
king
he
hunched
the
duke
private
i
see
him
do
it
and
then
he
looked
around
and
see
the
coffin
over
in
the
corner
on
two
chairs
so
then
him
and
the
duke
with
a
hand
across
each
other
shoulder
and
hand
to
their
eyes
walked
slow
and
solemn
over
there
everybody
dropping
back
to
give
them
room
and
all
the
talk
and
noise
stopping
people
saying
and
all
the
men
taking
their
hats
off
and
drooping
their
heads
so
you
could
heard
a
pin
fall
and
when
they
got
there
they
bent
over
and
looked
in
the
coffin
and
took
one
sight
and
then
they
bust
out
so
you
could
heard
them
to
orleans
most
and
then
they
put
their
arms
around
each
other
necks
and
hung
their
chins
over
each
other
shoulders
and
then
for
three
minutes
or
maybe
four
i
never
see
two
men
leak
the
way
they
done
and
mind
you
everybody
was
doing
the
same
and
the
place
was
that
damp
i
never
see
anything
like
it
then
one
of
them
got
on
one
side
of
the
coffin
and
on
side
and
they
kneeled
down
and
rested
their
foreheads
on
the
coffin
and
let
on
to
pray
all
to
themselves
well
when
it
come
to
that
it
worked
the
crowd
like
you
never
see
anything
like
it
and
everybody
broke
down
and
went
to
sobbing
right
out
loud
the
poor
girls
too
and
every
woman
nearly
went
up
to
the
girls
without
saying
a
word
and
kissed
them
solemn
on
the
forehead
and
then
put
their
hand
on
their
head
and
looked
up
towards
the
sky
with
the
tears
running
down
and
then
busted
out
and
went
off
sobbing
and
swabbing
and
give
the
next
woman
a
show
i
never
see
anything
so
disgusting
well
by
and
by
the
king
he
gets
up
and
comes
forward
a
little
and
works
himself
up
and
slobbers
out
a
speech
all
full
of
tears
and
flapdoodle
about
its
being
a
sore
trial
for
him
and
his
poor
brother
to
lose
the
diseased
and
to
miss
seeing
diseased
alive
after
the
long
journey
of
four
thousand
mile
but
a
trial
that
sweetened
and
sanctified
to
us
by
this
dear
sympathy
and
these
holy
tears
and
so
he
thanks
them
out
of
his
heart
and
out
of
his
brother
heart
because
out
of
their
mouths
they
ca
words
being
too
weak
and
cold
and
all
that
kind
of
rot
and
slush
till
it
was
just
sickening
and
then
he
blubbers
out
a
pious
amen
and
turns
himself
loose
and
goes
to
crying
fit
to
bust
and
the
minute
the
words
were
out
of
his
mouth
somebody
over
in
the
crowd
struck
up
the
doxolojer
and
everybody
joined
in
with
all
their
might
and
it
just
warmed
you
up
and
made
you
feel
as
good
as
church
letting
out
music
is
a
good
thing
and
after
all
that
and
hogwash
i
never
see
it
freshen
up
things
so
and
sound
so
honest
and
bully
then
the
king
begins
to
work
his
jaw
again
and
says
how
him
and
his
nieces
would
be
glad
if
a
few
of
the
main
principal
friends
of
the
family
would
take
supper
here
with
them
this
evening
and
help
set
up
with
the
ashes
of
the
diseased
and
says
if
his
poor
brother
laying
yonder
could
speak
he
knows
who
he
would
name
for
they
was
names
that
was
very
dear
to
him
and
mentioned
often
in
his
letters
and
so
he
will
name
the
same
to
wit
as
follows
rev
hobson
and
deacon
lot
hovey
and
ben
rucker
and
abner
shackleford
and
levi
bell
and
robinson
and
their
wives
and
the
widow
bartley
rev
hobson
and
robinson
was
down
to
the
end
of
the
town
together
that
is
i
mean
the
doctor
was
shipping
a
sick
man
to
world
and
the
preacher
was
pinting
him
right
lawyer
bell
was
away
up
to
louisville
on
business
but
the
rest
was
on
hand
and
so
they
all
come
and
shook
hands
with
the
king
and
thanked
him
and
talked
to
him
and
then
they
shook
hands
with
the
duke
and
did
say
nothing
but
just
kept
and
bobbing
their
heads
like
a
passel
of
sapheads
whilst
he
made
all
sorts
of
signs
with
his
hands
and
said
all
the
time
like
a
baby
that
ca
talk
so
the
king
he
blattered
along
and
managed
to
inquire
about
pretty
much
everybody
and
dog
in
town
by
his
name
and
mentioned
all
sorts
of
little
things
that
happened
one
time
or
another
in
the
town
or
to
george
family
or
to
peter
and
he
always
let
on
that
peter
wrote
him
the
things
but
that
was
a
lie
he
got
every
blessed
one
of
them
out
of
that
young
flathead
that
we
canoed
up
to
the
steamboat
then
mary
jane
she
fetched
the
letter
her
father
left
behind
and
the
king
he
read
it
out
loud
and
cried
over
it
it
give
the
and
three
thousand
dollars
gold
to
the
girls
and
it
give
the
tanyard
which
was
doing
a
good
business
along
with
some
other
houses
and
land
worth
about
seven
thousand
and
three
thousand
dollars
in
gold
to
harvey
and
william
and
told
where
the
six
thousand
cash
was
hid
down
cellar
so
these
two
frauds
said
they
go
and
fetch
it
up
and
have
everything
square
and
and
told
me
to
come
with
a
candle
we
shut
the
cellar
door
behind
us
and
when
they
found
the
bag
they
spilt
it
out
on
the
floor
and
it
was
a
lovely
sight
all
them
my
the
way
the
king
eyes
did
shine
he
slaps
the
duke
on
the
shoulder
and
says
oh
ai
bully
nor
oh
no
i
reckon
not
why
biljy
it
beats
the
nonesuch
it
the
duke
allowed
it
did
they
pawed
the
and
sifted
them
through
their
fingers
and
let
them
jingle
down
on
the
floor
and
the
king
says
it
ai
no
use
talkin
bein
brothers
to
a
rich
dead
man
and
representatives
of
furrin
heirs
that
got
left
is
the
line
for
you
and
me
bilge
thish
yer
comes
of
to
providence
it
the
best
way
in
the
long
run
i
tried
all
and
ther
ai
no
better
way
most
everybody
would
been
satisfied
with
the
pile
and
took
it
on
trust
but
no
they
must
count
it
so
they
counts
it
and
it
comes
out
four
hundred
and
fifteen
dollars
short
says
the
king
dern
him
i
wonder
what
he
done
with
that
four
hundred
and
fifteen
dollars
they
worried
over
that
awhile
and
ransacked
all
around
for
it
then
the
duke
says
well
he
was
a
pretty
sick
man
and
likely
he
made
a
mistake
i
reckon
that
the
way
of
it
the
best
way
to
let
it
go
and
keep
still
about
it

pile
twenty
elegant
little
piles
everybody
looked
hungry
at

and
licked
their
chops
then
they
raked

to
make
a
lot
of
signs
to
the
duke
with
his
hands
and
the
duke
he
looks
at
him
stupid
and
awhile
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
seems
to
catch
his
meaning
and
jumps
for
the
king
with
all
his
might
for
joy
and
hugs
him
about
fifteen
times
before

duke
and
then
such
another
hugging
and
kissing
i
never
see

and
everybody
crowded
up
with
the
tears
in
their
eyes
and
most
shook
the
hands
off
of
them
frauds
saying
all
the
time
you
good
souls
how
how
you
well
then
pretty
soon
all
hands
got
to
talking
about
the
diseased
again
and
how
good
he
was
and
what
a
loss
he
was
and
all
that
and
before
long
a
big
man
worked
himself
in
there
from
outside
and
stood
and
looking
and
not
saying
anything
and
nobody
saying
anything
to
him
either
because
the
king
was
talking
and
they
was
all
busy
listening
the
king
was
saying
in
the
middle
of
something
he
started
in
on
they
bein
partickler
friends
o
the
diseased
that
why
invited

evenin
but
tomorrow

for
he
respected
everybody

liked
everybody
and
so
it
fitten
that
his
funeral
orgies

and
so
he
went
on
and
on
liking
to
hear
himself
talk
and
every
little
while
he
fetched
in
his
funeral
orgies
again
till
the
duke
he
could
stand
it
no
more
so
he
writes
on
a
little
scrap
of
paper
you
old
fool
and
folds
it
up
and
goes
to
and
reaching
it
over
people
heads
to
him
the
king
he
reads
it
and
puts
it
in
his
pocket
and
says
poor
william
afflicted
as
he
is
his
aluz
right
asks
me
to
invite
everybody

was
at
then
he
weaves
along
again
perfectly
ca
and
goes
to
dropping
in
his
funeral
orgies
again
every
now
and
then
just
like
he
done
before
and
when
he
done
it
the
third
time
he
says

well
when
they
was
all

the
king
he
asks
mary
jane
how
they

rooms
and
she
said
she

one
spare
room
which

do
for
uncle
william
and
she
give
her
own
room
to
uncle
harvey
which
was
a
little
bigger
and
she
would
turn
into
the
room
with
her
sisters
and
sleep
on
a
cot
and
up
garret
was
a
little
cubby
with
a
pallet
in
it
the
king
said
the
cubby
would
do
for
his
valley
meaning
me
so
mary
jane
took
us
up

she
showed
them
their
rooms
which
was
plain
but

her

the
wall
and
before
them

a
curtain
made
out
of
calico
that
hung
down
to
the
floor
there
was
an
old
hair
trunk
in
one
corner
and
a
in
another
and
all
sorts
of
little
knickknacks
and
jimcracks
around
like
girls
brisken
up
a
room
with
the
king
said
it
was
all
the
more
homely
and
more
pleasanter
for
these
fixings
and
so
do
disturb
them
the
duke
room
was
pretty
small
but
plenty
good
enough
and
so

night
they

a
big
supper

waited
on
the
rest
mary
jane
she
set
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
susan
alongside
of
her
and
said
how
bad
the
biscuits
was
and
how
mean
the
preserves
was
and
how
ornery
and
tough
the
fried
chickens
was
and
all
that
kind
of
rot
the
way
women
always
do
for
to
force
out
compliments
and
the
people
all
knowed
everything
was
tiptop
and
said
so

how

a
girl
as

than
seventeen

i
would

take
a
week
shucks

then
what
does
the
rest

but
mainly
they
do
do
nothing
well
then
what
are
they
why
they
for
do
you
know
nothing
well
i
do
to
know
no
such
foolishness
as
that
how
is
servants
treated
in
england
do
they
treat
better
we
treat
our
niggers
a
servant
ai
nobody
there
they
treat
them
worse
than
dogs
do
they
give
holidays
the
way
we
do
christmas
and
new
week
and
fourth
of
july
oh
just
listen
a
body
could
tell
hai
ever
been
to
england
by
that
why
why
joanna
they
never
see
a
holiday
from
year
end
to
year
end
never
go
to
the
circus
nor
theater
nor
nigger
shows
nor
nowheres
nor
church
nor
church
but
always
went
to
church
well
i
was
gone
up
again
i
forgot
i
was
the
old
man
servant
but
next
minute
i
whirled
in
on
a
kind
of
an
explanation
how
a
valley
was
different
from
a
common
servant
and
to
go
to
church
whether
he
wanted
to
or
not
and
set
with
the
family
on
account
of
its
being
the
law
but
i
did
do
it
pretty
good
and
when
i
got
done
i
see
she
war
satisfied
she
says
honest
injun
now
hai
you
been
telling
me
a
lot
of
lies
honest
injun
says
i
none
of
it
at
all
none
of
it
at
all
not
a
lie
in
it
says
i
lay
your
hand
on
this
book
and
say
it
i
see
it
war
nothing
but
a
dictionary
so
i
laid
my
hand
on
it
and
said
it
so
then
she
looked
a
little
better
satisfied
and
says
well
then
i
believe
some
of
it
but
i
hope
to
gracious
if
believe
the
rest
what
is
it
you
wo
believe
jo
says
mary
jane
stepping
in
with
susan
behind
her
it
ai
right
nor
kind
for
you
to
talk
so
to
him
and
him
a
stranger
and
so
far
from
his
people
how
would
you
like
to
be
treated
so
that
always
your
way
maim
always
sailing
in
to
help
somebody
before
they
hurt
i
hai
done
nothing
to
him
he
told
some
stretchers
i
reckon
and
i
said
i
would
swallow
it
all
and
every
bit
and
grain
i
say
i
reckon
he
can
stand
a
little
thing
like
that
ca
he
i
do
care
whether
was
little
or
whether
was
big
he
here
in
our
house
and
a
stranger
and
it
was
good
of
you
to
say
it
if
you
was
in
his
place
it
would
make
you
feel
ashamed
and
so
you
to
say
a
thing
to
another
person
that
will
make
feel
ashamed
why
maim
he
said
it
do
make
no
difference
what
he
that
ai
the
thing
the
thing
is
for
you
to
treat
him
and
not
be
saying
things
to
make
him
remember
he
ai
in
his
own
country
and
amongst
his
own
folks
i
says
to
myself
is
a
girl
that
i
letting
that
old
reptile
rob
her
of
her
money
then
susan
waltzed
in
and
if
you
believe
me
she
did
give
hark
from
the
tomb
says
i
to
myself
and
this
is
one
that
i
letting
him
rob
her
of
her
money
then
mary
jane
she
took
another
inning
and
went
in
sweet
and
lovely
again
which
was
her
way
but
when
she
got
done
there
war
hardly
anything
left
o
poor
so
she
hollered
all
right
then
says
the
other
girls
you
just
ask
his
pardon
she
done
it
too
and
she
done
it
beautiful
she
done
it
so
beautiful
it
was
good
to
hear
and
i
wished
i
could
tell
her
a
thousand
lies
so
she
could
do
it
again
i
says
to
myself
this
is
one
that
i
letting
him
rob
her
of
her
money
and
when
she
got
through
they
all
jest
laid
theirselves
out
to
make
me
feel
at
home
and
know
i
was
amongst
friends
i
felt
so
ornery
and
low
down
and
mean
that
i
says
to
myself
my
mind
made
up
i
hive
that
money
for
them
or
bust
so
then
i
lit
out
for
bed
i
said
meaning
some
time
or
another
when
i
got
by
myself
i
went
to
thinking
the
thing
over
i
says
to
myself
shall
i
go
to
that
doctor
private
and
blow
on
these
frauds
no
that
wo
do
he
might
tell
who
told
him
then
the
king
and
the
duke
would
make
it
warm
for
me
shall
i
go
private
and
tell
mary
jane
no
i
das
do
it
her
face
would
give
them
a
hint
sure
they
got
the
money
and
they
slide
right
out
and
get
away
with
it
if
she
was
to
fetch
in
help
i
get
mixed
up
in
the
business
before
it
was
done
with
i
judge
no
there
ai
no
good
way
but
one
i
got
to
steal
that
money
somehow
and
i
got
to
steal
it
some
way
that
they
suspicion
that
i
done
it
they
got
a
good
thing
here
and
they
ai
to
leave
till
they
played
this
family
and
this
town
for
all
they
worth
so
i
find
a
chance
time
enough
i
steal
it
and
hide
it
and
by
and
by
when
i
away
down
the
river
write
a
letter
and
tell
mary
jane
where
it
hid
but
i
better
hive
it
if
i
can
because
the
doctor
maybe
has
let
up
as
much
as
he
lets
on
he
has
he
might
scare
them
out
of
here
yet
so
thinks
i
i
go
and
search
them
rooms
upstairs
the
hall
was
dark
but
i
found
the
duke
room
and
started
to
paw
around
it
with
my
hands
but
i
recollected
it
would
be
much
like
the
king
to
let
anybody
else
take
care
of
that
money
but
his
own
self
so
then
i
went
to
his
room
and
begun
to
paw
around
there
but
i
see
i
could
do
nothing
without
a
candle
and
i
das
light
one
of
course
so
i
judged
i
got
to
do
the
other
thing
lay
for
them
and
eavesdrop
about
that
time
i
hears
their
footsteps
coming
and
was
going
to
skip
under
the
bed
i
reached
for
it
but
it
was
where
i
thought
it
would
be
but
i
touched
the
curtain
that
hid
mary
jane
frocks
so
i
jumped
in
behind
that
and
snuggled
in
amongst
the
gowns
and
stood
there
perfectly
still
they
come
in
and
shut
the
door
and
the
first
thing
the
duke
done
was
to
get
down
and
look
under
the
bed
then
i
was
glad
i
had
found
the
bed
when
i
wanted
it
and
yet
you
know
kind
of
natural
to
hide
under
the
bed
when
you
are
up
to
anything
private
they
sets
down
then
and
the
king
says
well
what
is
it
and
cut
it
middlin
short
because
it
better
for
us
to
be
down
there
up
the
mournin
than
up
here
givin
a
chance
to
talk
us
over
well
this
is
it
capet
i
ai
easy
i
ai
comfortable
that
doctor
lays
on
my
mind
i
wanted
to
know
your
plans
i
got
a
notion
and
i
think
it
a
sound
one
what
is
it
duke
that
we
better
glide
out
of
this
before
three
in
the
morning
and
clip
it
down
the
river
with
what
we
got
specially
seeing
we
got
it
so
easy
back
to
us
flung
at
our
heads
as
you
may
say
when
of
course
we
allowed
to
have
to
steal
it
back
i
for
knocking
off
and
lighting
out
that
made
me
feel
pretty
bad
about
an
hour
or
two
ago
it
would
been
a
little
different
but
now
it
made
me
feel
bad
and
disappointed
the
king
rips
out
and
says
what
and
not
sell
out
the
rest
o
the
property
march
off
like
a
passel
of
fools
and
leave
eight
or
nine
dollars
worth
property
layin
around
jest
sufferin
to
be
scooped
in
and
all
good
salable
stuff
too
the
duke
he
grumbled
said
the
bag
of
gold
was
enough
and
he
want
to
go
no
deeper
did
want
to
rob
a
lot
of
orphans
of
they
had
why
how
you
talk
says
the
king
we
rob
of
nothing
at
all
but
jest
this
money
the
people
that
the
property
is
the
because
as
soon
it
found
out
we
did
own
it
which
wo
be
long
after
we
slid
the
sale
wo
be
valid
and
it
all
go
back
to
the
estate
these
yer
orphans
git
their
house
back
and
that
enough
for
they
young
and
spry
and
easy
earn
a
livin
ai
to
suffer
why
jest
think
there
and
that
ai
nigh
so
well
off
bless
you
ai
got
to
complain
of
well
the
king
he
talked
him
blind
so
at
last
he
give
in
and
said
all
right
but
said
he
believed
it
was
blamed
foolishness
to
stay
and
that
doctor
hanging
over
them
but
the
king
says
cuss
the
doctor
what
do
we
for
hai
we
got
all
the
fools
in
town
on
our
side
and
ai
that
a
big
enough
majority
in
any
town
so
they
got
ready
to
go
again
the
duke
says
i
do
think
we
put
that
money
in
a
good
place
that
cheered
me
up
i
begun
to
think
i
war
going
to
get
a
hint
of
no
kind
to
help
me
the
king
says
why
because
mary
jane
be
in
mourning
from
this
out
and
first
you
know
the
nigger
that
does
up
the
rooms
will
get
an
order
to
box
these
duds
up
and
put
away
and
do
you
reckon
a
nigger
can
run
across
money
and
not
borrow
some
of
it
your
head
level
duke
says
the
king
and
he
comes
under
the
curtain
two
or
three
foot
from
where
i
was
i
stuck
tight
to
the
wall
and
kept
mighty
still
though
quivery
and
i
wondered
what
them
fellows
would
say
to
me
if
they
catched
me
and
i
tried
to
think
what
i
better
do
if
they
did
catch
me
but
the
king
he
got
the
bag
before
i
could
think
more
than
about
a
half
a
thought
and
he
never
suspicioned
i
was
around
they
took
and
shoved
the
bag
through
a
rip
in
the
straw
tick
that
was
under
the
and
crammed
it
in
a
foot
or
two
amongst
the
straw
and
said
it
was
all
right
now
because
a
nigger
only
makes
up
the
and
turn
over
the
straw
tick
only
about
twice
a
year
and
so
it
war
in
no
danger
of
getting
stole
now
but
i
knowed
better
i
had
it
out
of
there
before
they
was
i
groped
along
up
to
my
cubby
and
hid
it
there
till
i
could
get
a
chance
to
do
better
i
judged
i
better
hide
it
outside
of
the
house
somewheres
because
if
they
missed
it
they
would
give
the
house
a
good
ransacking
i
knowed
that
very
well
then
i
turned
in
with
my
clothes
all
on
but
i
could
gone
to
sleep
if
i
wanted
to
i
was
in
such
a
sweat
to
get
through
with
the
business
by
and
by
i
heard
the
king
and
the
duke
come
up
so
i
rolled
off
my
pallet
and
laid
with
my
chin
at
the
top
of
my
ladder
and
waited
to
see
if
anything
was
going
to
happen
but
nothing
did
so
i
held
on
till
all
the
late
sounds
had
quit
and
the
early
ones
had
begun
yet
and
then
i
slipped
down
the
ladder
chapter
xxvii
i
crept
to
their
doors
and
listened
they
was
snoring
so
i
tiptoed
along
and
got
downstairs
all
right
there
war
a
sound
anywheres
i
peeped
through
a
crack
of
the
door
and
see
the
men
that
was
watching
the
corpse
all
sound
asleep
on
their
chairs
the
door
was
open
into
the
parlor
where
the
corpse
was
laying
and
there
was
a
candle
in
both
rooms
i
passed
along
and
the
parlor
door
was
open
but
i
see
there
war
nobody
in
there
but
the
remainders
of
peter
so
i
shoved
on
by
but
the
front
door
was
locked
and
the
key
there
just
then
i
heard
somebody
coming
down
the
stairs
back
behind
me
i
run
in
the
parlor
and
took
a
swift
look
around
and
the
only
place
i
see
to
hide
the
bag
was
in
the
coffin
the
lid
was
shoved
along
about
a
foot
showing
the
dead
man
face
down
in
there
with
a
wet
cloth
over
it
and
his
shroud
on
i
tucked
the
in
under
the
lid
just
down
beyond
where
his
hands
was
crossed
which
made
me
creep
they
was
so
cold
and
then
i
run
back
across
the
room
and
in
behind
the
door
the
person
coming
was
mary
jane
she
went
to
the
coffin
very
soft
and
kneeled
down
and
looked
in
then
she
put
up
her
handkerchief
and
i
see
she
begun
to
cry
though
i
could
hear
her
and
her
back
was
to
me
i
slid
out
and
as
i
passed
the
i
thought
i
make
sure
them
watchers
had
seen
me
so
i
looked
through
the
crack
and
everything
was
all
right
they
had
stirred
i
slipped
up
to
bed
feeling
ruther
blue
on
accounts
of
the
thing
playing
out
that
way
after
i
had
took
so
much
trouble
and
run
so
much
resk
about
it
says
i
if
it
could
stay
where
it
is
all
right
because
when
we
get
down
the
river
a
hundred
mile
or
two
i
could
write
back
to
mary
jane
and
she
could
dig
him
up
again
and
get
it
but
that
ai
the
thing
that
going
to
happen
the
thing
that
going
to
happen
is
the
money
be
found
when
they
come
to
screw
on
the
lid
then
the
king
get
it
again
and
it
be
a
long
day
before
he
gives
anybody
another
chance
to
smouch
it
from
him
of
course
i
to
slide
down
and
get
it
out
of
there
but
i
das
try
it
every
minute
it
was
getting
earlier
now
and
pretty
soon
some
of
them
watchers
would
begin
to
stir
and
i
might
get
catched
catched
with
six
thousand
dollars
in
my
hands
that
nobody
had
hired
me
to
take
care
of
i
do
wish
to
be
mixed
up
in
no
such
business
as
that
i
says
to
myself
when
i
got
in
the
morning
the
parlor
was
shut
up
and
the
watchers
was
gone
there
war
nobody
around
but
the
family
and
the
widow
bartley
and
our
tribe
i
watched
their
faces
to
see
if
anything
had
been
happening
but
i
could
tell
towards
the
middle
of
the
day
the
undertaker
come
with
his
man
and
they
set
the
coffin
in
the
middle
of
the
room
on
a
couple
of
chairs
and
then
set
all
our
chairs
in
rows
and
borrowed
more
from
the
neighbors
till
the
hall
and
the
parlor
and
the
was
full
i
see
the
coffin
lid
was
the
way
it
was
before
but
i
das
go
to
look
in
under
it
with
folks
around
then
the
people
begun
to
flock
in
and
the
beats
and
the
girls
took
seats
in
the
front
row
at
the
head
of
the
coffin
and
for
a
half
an
hour
the
people
filed
around
slow
in
single
rank
and
looked
down
at
the
dead
man
face
a
minute
and
some
dropped
in
a
tear
and
it
was
all
very
still
and
solemn
only
the
girls
and
the
beats
holding
handkerchiefs
to
their
eyes
and
keeping
their
heads
bent
and
sobbing
a
little
there
war
no
other
sound
but
the
scraping
of
the
feet
on
the
floor
and
blowing
noses
because
people
always
blows
them
more
at
a
funeral
than
they
do
at
other
places
except
church
when
the
place
was
packed
full
the
undertaker
he
slid
around
in
his
black
gloves
with
his
softy
soothering
ways
putting
on
the
last
touches
and
getting
people
and
things
all
and
comfortable
and
making
no
more
sound
than
a
cat
he
never
spoke
he
moved
people
around
he
squeezed
in
late
ones
he
opened
up
passageways
and
done
it
with
nods
and
signs
with
his
hands
then
he
took
his
place
over
against
the
wall
he
was
the
softest
glidingest
stealthiest
man
i
ever
see
and
there
war
no
more
smile
to
him
than
there
is
to
a
ham
they
had
borrowed
a
melodeum
a
sick
one
and
when
everything
was
ready
a
young
woman
set
down
and
worked
it
and
it
was
pretty
skreeky
and
colicky
and
everybody
joined
in
and
sung
and
peter
was
the
only
one
that
had
a
good
thing
according
to
my
notion
then
the
reverend
hobson
opened
up
slow
and
solemn
and
begun
to
talk
and
straight
off
the
most
outrageous
row
busted
out
in
the
cellar
a
body
ever
heard
it
was
only
one
dog
but
he
made
a
most
powerful
racket
and
he
kept
it
up
right
along
the
parson
he
had
to
stand
there
over
the
coffin
and
wait
you
could
hear
yourself
think
it
was
right
down
awkward
and
nobody
did
seem
to
know
what
to
do
but
pretty
soon
they
see
that
undertaker
make
a
sign
to
the
preacher
as
much
as
to
say
do
you
worry
just
depend
on
me
then
he
stooped
down
and
begun
to
glide
along
the
wall
just
his
shoulders
showing
over
the
heads
so
he
glided
along
and
the
powwow
and
racket
getting
more
and
more
outrageous
all
the
time
and
at
last
when
he
had
gone
around
two
sides
of
the
room
he
disappears
down
cellar
then
in
about
two
seconds
we
heard
a
whack
and
the
dog
he
finished
up
with
a
most
amazing
howl
or
two
and
then
everything
was
dead
still
and
the
parson
begun
his
solemn
talk
where
he
left
off
in
a
minute
or
two
here
comes
this
undertaker
back
and
shoulders
gliding
along
the
wall
again
and
so
he
glided
and
glided
around
three
sides
of
the
room
and
then
rose
up
and
shaded
his
mouth
with
his
hands
and
stretched
his
neck
out
towards
the
preacher
over
the
people
heads
and
says
in
a
kind
of
a
coarse
whisper
had
a
rat
then
he
drooped
down
and
glided
along
the
wall
again
to
his
place
you
could
see
it
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
the
people
because
naturally
they
wanted
to
know
a
little
thing
like
that
do
cost
nothing
and
it
just
the
little
things
that
makes
a
man
to
be
looked
up
to
and
liked
there
war
no
more
popular
man
in
town
than
what
that
undertaker
was
well
the
funeral
sermon
was
very
good
but
pison
long
and
tiresome
and
then
the
king
he
shoved
in
and
got
off
some
of
his
usual
rubbage
and
at
last
the
job
was
through
and
the
undertaker
begun
to
sneak
up
on
the
coffin
with
his
i
was
in
a
sweat
then
and
watched
him
pretty
keen
but
he
never
meddled
at
all
just
slid
the
lid
along
as
soft
as
mush
and
screwed
it
down
tight
and
fast
so
there
i
was
i
did
know
whether
the
money
was
in
there
or
not
so
says
i
somebody
has
hogged
that
bag
on
the
sly
now
how
do
know
whether
to
write
to
mary
jane
or
not
she
dug
him
up
and
did
find
nothing
what
would
she
think
of
me
blame
it
i
says
i
might
get
hunted
up
and
jailed
i
better
lay
low
and
keep
dark
and
not
write
at
all
the
thing
awful
mixed
now
trying
to
better
it
i
worsened
it
a
hundred
times
and
i
wish
to
goodness
i
just
let
it
alone
dad
fetch
the
whole
business
they
buried
him
and
we
come
back
home
and
i
went
to
watching
faces
again
i
could
help
it
and
i
could
rest
easy
but
nothing
come
of
it
the
faces
did
tell
me
nothing
the
king
he
visited
around
in
the
evening
and
sweetened
everybody
up
and
made
himself
ever
so
friendly
and
he
give
out
the
idea
that
his
congregation
over
in
england
would
be
in
a
sweat
about
him
so
he
must
hurry
and
settle
up
the
estate
right
away
and
leave
for
home
he
was
very
sorry
he
was
so
pushed
and
so
was
everybody
they
wished
he
could
stay
longer
but
they
said
they
could
see
it
could
be
done
and
he
said
of
course
him
and
william
would
take
the
girls
home
with
them
and
that
pleased
everybody
too
because
then
the
girls
would
be
well
fixed
and
amongst
their
own
relations
and
it
pleased
the
girls
too
tickled
them
so
they
clean
forgot
they
ever
had
a
trouble
in
the
world
and
told
him
to
sell
out
as
quick
as
he
wanted
to
they
would
be
ready
them
poor
things
was
that
glad
and
happy
it
made
my
heart
ache
to
see
them
getting
fooled
and
lied
to
so
but
i
did
see
no
safe
way
for
me
to
chip
in
and
change
the
general
tune
well
blamed
if
the
king
did
bill
the
house
and
the
niggers
and
all
the
property
for
auction
straight
off
sale
two
days
after
the
funeral
but
anybody
could
buy
private
beforehand
if
they
wanted
to
so
the
next
day
after
the
funeral
along
about
the
joy
got
the
first
jolt
a
couple
of
come
along
and
the
king
sold
them
the
niggers
reasonable
for
drafts
as
they
called
it
and
away
they
went
the
two
sons
up
the
river
to
memphis
and
their
mother
down
the
river
to
orleans
i
thought
them
poor
girls
and
them
niggers
would
break
their
hearts
for
grief
they
cried
around
each
other
and
took
on
so
it
most
made
me
down
sick
to
see
it
the
girls
said
they
had
ever
dreamed
of
seeing
the
family
separated
or
sold
away
from
the
town
i
ca
ever
get
it
out
of
my
memory
the
sight
of
them
poor
miserable
girls
and
niggers
hanging
around
each
other
necks
and
crying
and
i
reckon
i
could
stood
it
all
but
would
had
to
bust
out
and
tell
on
our
gang
if
i
had
knowed
the
sale
war
no
account
and
the
niggers
would
be
back
home
in
a
week
or
two
the
thing
made
a
big
stir
in
the
town
too
and
a
good
many
come
out
flatfooted
and
said
it
was
scandalous
to
separate
the
mother
and
the
children
that
way
it
injured
the
frauds
some
but
the
old
fool
he
bulled
right
along
spite
of
all
the
duke
could
say
or
do
and
i
tell
you
the
duke
was
powerful
uneasy
next
day
was
auction
day
about
broad
day
in
the
morning
the
king
and
the
duke
come
up
in
the
garret
and
woke
me
up
and
i
see
by
their
look
that
there
was
trouble
the
king
says
was
you
in
my
room
night
before
last
no
your
majesty
which
was
the
way
i
always
called
him
when
nobody
but
our
gang
war
around
was
you
in
there
yisterday
er
last
night
no
your
majesty
honor
bright
now
no
lies
honor
bright
your
majesty
i
telling
you
the
truth
i
hai
been
your
room
since
miss
mary
jane
took
you
and
the
duke
and
showed
it
to
you
the
duke
says
have
you
seen
anybody
else
go
in
there
no
your
grace
not
as
i
remember
i
believe
stop
and
think
i
studied
awhile
and
see
my
chance
then
i
says
well
i
see
the
niggers
go
in
there
several
times
both
of
them
gave
a
little
jump
and
looked
like
they
had
ever
expected
it
and
then
like
they
then
the
duke
says
what
of
them
no
leastways
not
all
at
once
that
is
i
do
think
i
ever
see
them
all
come
at
once
but
just
one
time
hello
when
was
that
it
was
the
day
we
had
the
funeral
in
the
morning
it
war
early
because
i
overslept
i
was
just
starting
down
the
ladder
and
i
see
them
well
go
on
on
what
did
they
do
how
they
act
they
did
do
nothing
and
they
did
act
anyway
much
as
fur
as
i
see
they
tiptoed
away
so
i
seen
easy
enough
that
they
shoved
in
there
to
do
up
your
majesty
room
or
something
you
was
up
and
found
you
up
and
so
they
was
hoping
to
slide
out
of
the
way
of
trouble
without
waking
you
up
if
they
had
already
waked
you
up
great
guns
is
a
go
says
the
king
and
both
of
them
looked
pretty
sick
and
tolerable
silly
they
stood
there
and
scratching
their
heads
a
minute
and
the
duke
he
bust
into
a
kind
of
a
little
raspy
chuckle
and
says
it
does
beat
all
how
neat
the
niggers
played
their
hand
they
let
on
to
be
they
was
going
out
of
this
region
and
i
believed
they
sorry
and
so
did
you
and
so
did
everybody
do
ever
tell
any
more
that
a
nigger
ai
got
any
histrionic
talent
why
the
way
they
played
that
thing
it
would
fool
in
my
opinion
there
a
fortune
in
if
i
had
capital
and
a
theater
i
want
a
better
than
that
and
here
we
gone
and
sold
for
a
song
yes
and
ai
privileged
to
sing
the
song
yet
say
where
that
song
that
draft
in
the
bank
for
to
be
collected
where
it
be
well
that
all
right
then
thank
goodness
says
i
kind
of
is
something
gone
wrong
the
king
whirls
on
me
and
rips
out
none
o
your
business
you
keep
your
head
shet
and
mind
own
affairs
if
you
got
any
long
as
you
in
this
town
do
you
forgit
you
hear
then
he
says
to
the
duke
we
got
to
jest
swaller
it
and
say
mum
the
word
for
as
they
was
starting
down
the
ladder
the
duke
he
chuckles
again
and
says
quick
sales
small
profits
it
a
good
business
yes
the
king
snarls
around
on
him
and
says
i
was
trying
to
do
for
the
best
in
sellin
out
so
quick
if
the
profits
has
turned
out
to
be
none
lackin
considable
and
none
to
carry
is
it
my
fault
any
it
yourn
well
be
in
this
house
yet
and
we
if
i
could
got
my
advice
listened
to
the
king
sassed
back
as
much
as
was
safe
for
him
and
then
swapped
around
and
lit
into
again
he
give
me
down
the
banks
for
not
coming
and
him
i
see
the
niggers
come
out
of
his
room
acting
that
way
said
any
fool
would
something
was
up
and
then
waltzed
in
and
cussed
awhile
and
said
it
all
come
of
him
not
laying
late
and
taking
his
natural
rest
that
morning
and
he
be
blamed
if
he
ever
do
it
again
so
they
went
off
and
i
felt
dreadful
glad
i
worked
it
all
off
onto
the
niggers
and
yet
done
the
niggers
no
harm
by
it
chapter
xxviii
by
and
by
it
was
time
so
i
come
down
the
ladder
and
started
for
but
as
i
come
to
the
girls
room
the
door
was
open
and
i
see
mary
jane
setting
by
her
old
hair
trunk
which
was
open
and
she
been
packing
things
in
it
getting
ready
to
go
to
england
but
she
had
stopped
now
with
a
folded
gown
in
her
lap
and
had
her
face
in
her
hands
crying
i
felt
awful
bad
to
see
it
of
course
anybody
would
i
went
in
there
and
says
miss
mary
jane
you
ca
to
see
people
in
trouble
and
ca
most
always
tell
me
about
it
so
she
done
it
and
it
was
the
niggers
i
just
expected
it
she
said
the
beautiful
trip
to
england
was
most
about
spoiled
for
her
she
did
know
she
was
ever
going
to
be
happy
there
knowing
the
mother
and
the
children
war
ever
going
to
see
each
other
no
more
and
then
busted
out
bitterer
than
ever
and
flung
up
her
hands
and
says
oh
dear
dear
to
think
they
ai
going
to
see
each
other
any
more
but
they
and
inside
of
two
weeks
and
i
it
says
i
laws
it
was
out
before
i
could
think
and
before
i
could
budge
she
throws
her
arms
around
my
neck
and
told
me
to
say
it
say
it
say
it
i
see
i
had
spoke
too
sudden
and
said
too
much
and
was
in
a
close
place
i
asked
her
to
let
me
think
a
minute
and
she
set
there
very
impatient
and
excited
and
handsome
but
looking
kind
of
happy
and
like
a
person
that
had
a
tooth
pulled
out
so
i
went
to
studying
it
out
i
says
to
myself
i
reckon
a
body
that
ups
and
tells
the
truth
when
he
is
in
a
tight
place
is
taking
considerable
many
resks
though
i
ai
had
no
experience
and
ca
say
for
certain
but
it
looks
so
to
me
anyway
and
yet
here
a
case
where
i
blest
if
it
do
look
to
me
like
the
truth
is
better
and
actuly
than
a
lie
i
must
lay
it
by
in
my
mind
and
think
it
over
some
time
or
other
it
so
kind
of
strange
and
unregular
i
never
see
nothing
like
it
well
i
says
to
myself
at
last
i
to
chance
it
i
up
and
tell
the
truth
this
time
though
it
does
seem
most
setting
down
on
a
kag
of
powder
and
touching
it
off
just
to
see
where
you
go
to
then
i
says
miss
mary
jane
is
there
any
place
out
of
town
a
little
ways
where
you
could
go
and
stay
three
or
four
days
yes
lothrop
why
never
mind
why
yet
if
i
tell
you
how
i
know
the
niggers
will
see
each
other
again
inside

couple
of
frauds

over
the
worst
of
it
you
can
stand
the
rest
middling
easy
it
jolted
her
up
like
everything
of
course
but
i
was
over
the
shoal
water
now
so
i
went
right
along
her
eyes
higher
and
higher
all
the
time
and
told
her
every
blame
thing
from
where
we
first
struck
that
young
fool
going
up
to
the
steamboat
clear
through
to
where
she
flung
herself
onto
the
king
breast
at
the
front
door
and
he
kissed
her
sixteen
or
seventeen
times
and
then
up
she
jumps
with
her
face
afire
like
sunset
and
says
the
brute
come
do
waste
a
minute
not
a
we
have
them
tarred
and
feathered
and
flung
in
the
river
says
i
but
do
you
mean
you
go
to
lothrop
or
oh
she
says
what
am
i
about
she
says
and
set
right
down
again
do
mind
what
i
said
please
do
you
now
you
laying
her
silky
hand
on
mine
in
that
kind
of
a
way
that
i
said
i
would
die
first
i
never
thought
i
was
so
stirred
up
she
says
now
go
on
and
i
wo
do
so
any
more
you
tell
me
what
to
do
and
whatever
you
say
i
do
it
well
i
says
it
a
rough
gang
them
two
frauds
and
i
fixed
so
i
got
to
travel
with
them
a
while
longer
whether
i
want
to
or
not
i
druther
not
tell
you
why
and
if
you
was
to
blow
on
them
this
town
would
get
me
out
of
their
claws
and
i
be
all
right
but
there
be
another
person
that
you
do
know
about
who
be
in
big
trouble
well
we
got
to
save
hai
we
of
course
well
then
we
blow
on
them
saying
them
words
put
a
good
idea
in
my
head
i
see
how
maybe
i
could
get
me
and
jim
rid
of
the
frauds
get
them
jailed
here
and
then
leave
but
i
did
want
to
run
the
raft
in
the
daytime
without
anybody
aboard
to
answer
questions
but
me
so
i
did
want
the
plan
to
begin
working
till
pretty
late
i
says
miss
mary
jane
i
tell
you
what
we
do
and
you
wo
have
to
stay
at
lothrop
so
long
nuther
how
fur
is
it
a
little
short
of
four
miles
right
out
in
the
country
back
here
well
that
answer
now
you
go
along
out
there
and
lay
low
till
nine
or
half
past
and
then
get
them
to
fetch
you
home
again
tell
them
you
thought
of
something
if
you
get
here
before
eleven
put
a
candle
in
this
window
and
if
i
do
turn
up
wait
eleven
and
if
i
do
turn
up
it
means
i
gone
and
out
of
the
way
and
safe
then
you
come
out
and
spread
the
news
around
and
get
these
beats
jailed
good
she
says
i
do
it
and
if
it
just
happens
so
that
i
do
get
away
but
get
took
up
along
with
them
you
must
up
and
say
i
told
you
the
whole
thing
beforehand
and
you
must
stand
by
me
all
you
can
stand
by
you
indeed
i
will
they
touch
a
hair
of
your
head
she
says
and
i
see
her
nostrils
spread
and
her
eyes
snap
when
she
said
it
too
if
i
get
away
i
be
here
i
says
to
prove
these
rapscallions
ai
your
uncles
and
i
could
do
it
if
i
here
i
could
swear
they
was
beats
and
bummers
that
all
though
worth
something
well
there
others
can
do
that
better
than
what
i
can
and
they
people
that
ai
going
to
be
doubted
as
quick
as
be
i
tell
you
how
to
find
them
gim
me
a
pencil
and
a
piece
of
paper
there
nonesuch
put
it
away
and
lose
it
when
the
court
wants
to
find
out
something
about
these
two
let
them
send
up
to
bricksville
and
say
they
got
the
men
that
played
the
nonesuch
and
ask
for
some
witnesses
why
have
that
entire
town
down
here
before
you
can
hardly
wink
miss
mary
and
they
come
too
i
judged
we

got
everything
fixed
about
right
now
so
i
says
just
let
the
auction
go
right
along
and
do
worry
nobody

to
pay
for
the
things
they
buy
till
a
whole
day
after
the
auction
on
accounts
of
the
short
notice
and
they
ai
going
out
of
this
till
they
get
that
money
and
the
way
we
fixed
it
the
sale
ai
going
to
count
and
they
ai
going
to
get
no
money
it
just
like
the
way
it
was
with
the
niggers
it
war
no
sale
and
the
niggers
will
be
back
before
long
why
they
ca
collect
the
money
for
the
yet
they
in
the
worst
kind
of
a
fix
miss

to
breakfast
now
and
then
i
start
straight
for
mr
lothrop
ai
the
ticket
miss
mary
jane
i

what
did
you
reckon
i
wanted
you
to
go
at
all
for
miss
mary
well
i
never
thought
and
come
to
think
i
do
know
what
was
it
why
it
because
you
ai
one
of
these
people
i
want
no
better
book
than
what
your
face
is
a
body
can
set
down
and
read
it
off
like
coarse
print
do
you
reckon
you
can
go
and
face
your
uncles
when
they
come
to
kiss
you
and
never
there
there
do
yes
i
go
before
breakfast
i
be
glad
to
and
leave
my
sisters
with
them
yes
never
mind
about
them
they
got
to
stand
it
yet
awhile
they
might
suspicion
something
if
all
of
you
was
to
go
i
do
want
you
to
see
them
nor
your
sisters
nor
nobody
in
this
town
if
a
neighbor
was
to
ask
how
is
your
uncles
this
morning
your
face
would
tell
something
no
you
go
right
along
miss
mary
jane
and
i
fix
it
with
all
of
them
i
tell
miss
susan
to
give
your
love
to
your
uncles
and
say
you
went
away
for
a
few
hours
for
to
get
a
little
rest
and
change
or
to
see
a
friend
and
you
be
back
or
early
in
the
morning
gone
to
see
a
friend
is
all
right
but
i
wo
have
my
love
given
to
them
well
then
it
be
it
was
well
enough
to
tell
so
no
harm
in
it
it
was
only
a
little
thing
to
do
and
no
trouble
and
the
little
things
that
smooths
people
roads
the
most
down
here
below
it
would
make
mary
jane
comfortable
and
it
would
cost
nothing
then
i
says
there
one
more
thing
that
bag
of
money
well
they
got
that
and
it
makes
me
feel
pretty
silly
to
think
they
got
it
no
you
out
there
they
hai
got
it
why
who
got
it
i
wish
i
knowed
but
i
do
i
it
because
i
stole
it
from
them
and
i
stole
it
to
give
to
you
and
i
know
where
i
hid
it
but
i
afraid
it
ai
there
no
more
i
awful
sorry
miss
mary
jane
i
just
as
sorry
as
i
can
be
but
i
done
the
best
i
could
i
did
honest
i
come
nigh
getting
caught
and
i
had
to
shove
it
into
the
first
place
i
come
to
and
run
and
it
war
a
good
place
oh
stop
blaming
yourself
it
too
bad
to
do
it
and
i
wo
allow
it
you
could
help
it
it
was
your
fault
where
did
you
hide
it
i
did
want
to
set
her
to
thinking
about
her
troubles
again
and
i
could
seem
to
get
my
mouth
to
tell
her
what
would
make
her
see
that
corpse
laying
in
the
coffin
with
that
bag
of
money
on
his
stomach
so
for
a
minute
i
did
say
nothing
then
i
says
i
ruther
not
you
where
i
put
it
miss
mary
jane
if
you
do
mind
letting
me
off
but
i
write
it
for
you
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
you
can
read
it
along
the
road
to
lothrop
if
you
want
to
do
you
reckon
that
do
oh
yes
so
i
wrote
i
put
it
in
the
coffin
it
was
in
there
when
you
was
crying
there
away
in
the
night
i
was
behind
the
door
and
i
was
mighty
sorry
for
you
miss
mary
jane
it
made
my
eyes
water
a
little
to
remember
her
crying
there
all
by
herself
in
the
night
and
them
devils
laying
there
right
under
her
own
roof
shaming
her
and
robbing
her
and
when
i
folded
it
up
and
give
it
to
her
i
see
the
water
come
into
her
eyes
too
and
she
shook
me
by
the
hand
hard
and
says
i
going
to
do
everything
just
as
you
told
me
and
if
i
do
ever
see
you
again
i
ever
forget
you
and
i
think
of
you
a
many
and
a
many
a
time
and
i
for
you
too
and
she
was
gone
pray
for
me
i
reckoned
if
she
knowed
me
she
take
a
job
that
was
more
nearer
her
size
but
i
bet
she
done
it
just
the
same
she
was
just
that
kind
she
had
the
grit
to
pray
for
judus
if
she
took
the
notion
there
war
no
to
her
i
judge
you
may
say
what
you
want
to
but
in
my
opinion
she
had
more
sand
in
her
than
any
girl
i
ever
see
in
my
opinion
she
was
just
full
of
sand
it
sounds
like
flattery
but
it
ai
no
flattery
and
when
it
comes
to
beauty
and
goodness
too
she
lays
over
them
all
i
hai
ever
seen
her
since
that
time
that
i
see
her
go
out
of
that
door
no
i
hai
ever
seen
her
since
but
i
reckon
i
thought
of
her
a
many
and
a
many
a
million
times
and
of
her
saying
she
would
pray
for
me
and
if
ever
i
thought
it
would
do
any
good
for
me
to
pray
for
blamed
if
i
would
done
it
or
bust
well
mary
jane
she
lit
out
the
back
way
i
reckon
because
nobody
see
her
go
when
i
struck
susan
and
the
i
says
what
the
name
of
them
people
over
on
side
of
the
river
that
you
all
goes
to
see
sometimes
they
says
there
several
but
it
the
proctors
mainly
that
the
name
i
says
i
most
forgot
it
well
miss
mary
jane
she
told
me
to
tell
you
she
gone
over
there
in
a
dreadful
hurry
one
of
them
sick
which
one
i
do
know
leastways
i
kinder
forget
but
i
thinks
it
sakes
alive
i
hope
it
ai
i
sorry
to
say
it
i
says
but
hanner
the
very
one
my
goodness
and
she
so
well
only
last
week
is
she
took
bad
it
ai
no
name
for
it
they
set
up
with
her
all
night
miss
mary
jane
said
and
they
do
think
she
last
many
hours
only
think
of
that
now
what
the
matter
with
her
i
could
think
of
anything
reasonable
right
off
that
way
so
i
says
mumps
mumps
your
granny
they
do
set
up
with
people
that
got
the
mumps
they
do
do
they
you
better
bet
they
do
with
mumps
these
mumps
is
different
it
a
new
kind
miss
mary
jane
said
how
it
a
new
kind
because
it
mixed
up
with
other
things
what
other
things
well
measles
and
and
erysiplas
and
consumption
and
yaller
janders
and
and
i
do
know
what
all
my
land
and
they
call
it
the
that
what
miss
mary
jane
said
well
what
in
the
nation
do
they
call
it
the
for
why
because
it
the
mumps
that
what
it
starts
with
well
ther
ai
no
sense
in
it
a
body
might
stump
his
toe
and
take
pison
and
fall
down
the
well
and
break
his
neck
and
bust
his
brains
out
and
somebody
come
along
and
ask
what
killed
him
and
some
numskull
up
and
say
he
stumped
his
would
ther
be
any
sense
in
that
and
ther
ai
no
sense
in
nuther
is
it
ketching
is
it
why
how
you
talk
is
a
catching
in
the
dark
if
you
do
hitch
on
to
one
tooth
you
bound
to
on
another
ai
you
and
you
ca
get
away
with
that
tooth
without
fetching
the
whole
harrow
along
can
you
well
these
kind
of
mumps
is
a
kind
of
a
harrow
as
you
may
say
and
it
ai
no
slouch
of
a
harrow
nuther
you
come
to
get
it
hitched
on
good
well
it
awful
i
think
says
the
i
go
to
uncle
harvey
and
oh
yes
i
says
i
of
i
would
i
would
lose
no
time
well
why
would
you
just
look
at
it
a
minute
and
maybe
you
can
see
hai
your
uncles
obleeged
to
get
along
home
to
england
as
fast
as
they
can
and
do
you
reckon
they
be
mean
enough
to
go
off
and
leave
you
to
go
all
that
journey
by
yourselves
know
they
wait
for
you
so
fur
so
good
your
uncle
harvey
a
preacher
ai
he
very
well
then
is
a
going
to
deceive
a
steamboat
clerk
is
he
going
to
deceive
a
clerk
so
as
to
get
them
to
let
miss
mary
jane
go
aboard
now
know
he
ai
what
he
do
then
why
he
say
a
great
pity
but
my
church
matters
has
got
to
get
along
the
best
way
they
can
for
my
niece
has
been
exposed
to
the
dreadful
mumps
and
so
it
my
bounden
duty
to
set
down
here
and
wait
the
three
months
it
takes
to
show
on
her
if
she
got
it
but
never
mind
if
you
think
it
best
to
tell
your
uncle
harvey
shucks
and
stay
fooling
around
here
when
we
could
all
be
having
good
times
in
england
whilst
we
was
waiting
to
find
out
whether
mary
got
it
or
not
why
you
talk
like
a
muggins
well
anyway
maybe
you
better
tell
some
of
the
neighbors
listen
at
that
now
you
do
beat
all
for
natural
stupidness
you
that
go
and
tell
ther
ai
no
way
but
just
to
not
tell
anybody
at
well
maybe
you
right
yes
i
judge
you
right
but
i
reckon
we
ought
to
tell
uncle
harvey
she
gone
out
awhile
anyway
so
he
wo
be
uneasy
about
her
yes
miss
mary
jane
she
wanted
you
to
do
that
she
says
them
to
give
uncle
harvey
and
william
my
love
and
a
kiss
and
say
i
run
over
the
river
to
see
what
the
name
of
that
rich
family
your
uncle
peter
used
to
think
so
much
of
i
mean
the
one
that
why
you
must
mean
the
apthorps
ai
it
of
course
bother
them
kind
of
names
a
body
ca
ever
seem
to
remember
them
half
the
time
somehow
yes
she
said
say
she
has
run
over
for
to
ask
the
apthorps
to
be
sure
and
come
to
the
auction
and
buy
this
house
because
she
allowed
her
uncle
peter
would
ruther
they
had
it
than
anybody
else
and
she
going
to
stick
to
them
till
they
say
they
come
and
then
if
she
ai
too
tired
she
coming
home
and
if
she
is
she
be
home
in
the
morning
anyway
she
said
say
nothing
about
the
proctors
but
only
about
the
apthorps
which
be
perfectly
true
because
she
is
going
there
to
speak
about
their
buying
the
house
i
know
it
because
she
told
me
so
herself
all
right
they
said
and
cleared
out
to
lay
for
their
uncles
and
give
them
the
love
and
the
kisses
and
tell
them
the
message
everything
was
all
right
now
the
girls
would
say
nothing
because
they
wanted
to
go
to
england
and
the
king
and
the
duke
would
ruther
mary
jane
was
off
working
for
the
auction
than
around
in
reach
of
doctor
robinson
i
felt
very
good
i
judged
i
had
done
it
pretty
neat
i
reckoned
tom
sawyer
could
done
it
no
neater
himself
of
course
he
would
throwed
more
style
into
it
but
i
ca
do
that
very
handy
not
being
brung
up
to
it
well
they
held
the
auction
in
the
public
square
along
towards
the
end
of
the
afternoon
and
it
strung
along
and
strung
along
and
the
old
man
he
was
on
hand
and
looking
his
level
pisonest
up
there
longside
of
the
auctioneer
and
chipping
in
a
little
scripture
now
and
then
or
a
little
saying
of
some
kind
and
the
duke
he
was
around
for
sympathy
all
he
knowed
how
and
just
spreading
himself
generly
but
by
and
by
the
thing
dragged
through
and
everything
was
sold
everything
but
a
little
old
trifling
lot
in
the
graveyard
so
they
got
to
work
off
i
never
see
such
a
girafft
as
the
king
was
for
wanting
to
swallow
well
whilst
they
was
at
it
a
steamboat
landed
and
in
about
two
minutes
up
comes
a
crowd
and
yelling
and
laughing
and
carrying
on
and
singing
out
your
opposition
line
here
your
two
sets
o
heirs
to
old
peter
wilks
and
you
pays
your
money
and
you
takes
your
choice
chapter
xxix
they
was
fetching
a
very
old
gentleman
along
and
a
younger
one
with
his
right
arm
in
a
sling
and
my
souls
how
the
people
yelled
and
laughed
and
kept
it
up
but
i
see
no
joke
about
it
and
i
judged
it
would
strain
the
duke
and
the
king
some
to
see
any
i
reckoned
they
turn
pale
but
no
nary
a
pale
did
turn
the
duke
he
never
let
on
he
suspicioned
what
was
up
but
just
went
a
around
happy
and
satisfied
like
a
jug
that
googling
out
buttermilk
and
as
for
the
king
he
just
gazed
and
gazed
down
sorrowful
on
them
like
it
give
him
the
in
his
very
heart
to
think
there
could
be
such
frauds
and
rascals
in
the
world
oh
he
done
it
admirable
lots
of
the
principal
people
gethered
around
the
king
to
let
him
see
they
was
on
his
side
that
old
gentleman
that
had
just
come
looked
all
puzzled
to
death
pretty
soon
he
begun
to
speak
and
i
see
straight
off
he
pronounced
an
englishman
not
the
king
way
though
the
king
pretty
good
for
an
imitation
i
ca
give
the
old
gent
words
nor
i
ca
imitate
him
but
he
turned
around
to
the
crowd
and
says
about
like
this
this
is
a
surprise
to
me
which
i
was
looking
for
and
acknowledge
candid
and
frank
i
ai
very
well
fixed
to
meet
it
and
answer
it
for
my
brother
and
me
has
had
misfortunes
he
broke
his
arm
and
our
baggage
got
put
off
at
a
town
above
here
last
night
in
the
night
by
a
mistake
i
am
peter
wilks
brother
harvey
and
this
is
his
brother
william
which
ca
hear
nor
speak
and
ca
even
make
signs
to
amount
to
much
he
only
got
one
hand
to
work
them
with
we
are
who
we
say
we
are
and
in
a
day
or
two
when
i
get
the
baggage
i
can
prove
it
but
up
till
then
i
wo
say
nothing
more
but
go
to
the
hotel
and
wait
so
him
and
the
new
dummy
started
off
and
the
king
he
laughs
and
blethers
out
broke
his
arm
likely
it
and
very
convenient
too
for
a
fraud
that
got
to
make
signs
and
ai
learnt
how
lost
their
baggage
that
good
and
mighty
ingenious
under
the
so
he
laughed
again
and
so
did
everybody
else
except
three
or
four
or
maybe
half
a
dozen
one
of
these
was
that
doctor
another
one
was
a
gentleman
with
a
of
the
kind
made
out
of
that
had
just
come
off
of
the
steamboat
and
was
talking
to
him
in
a
low
voice
and
glancing
towards
the
king
now
and
then
and
nodding
their
heads
it
was
levi
bell
the
lawyer
that
was
gone
up
to
louisville
and
another
one
was
a
big
rough
husky
that
come
along
and
listened
to
all
the
old
gentlemen
said
and
was
listening
to
the
king
now
and
when
the
king
got
done
this
husky
up
and
says
say
looky
here
if
you
are
harvey
wilks
when
you
come
to
this
town
the
day
before
the
funeral
friend
says
the
king
but
what
time
o
day
in
the
evenin
an
hour
er
two
before
sundown
how
you
come
i
come
down
on
the
from
cincinnati
well
then
how
you
come
to
be
up
at
the
pint
in
the
in
a
canoe
i
war
up
at
the
pint
in
the
mornin
it
a
lie
several
of
them
jumped
for
him
and
begged
him
not
to
talk
that
way
to
an
old
man
and
a
preacher
preacher
be
hanged
he
a
fraud
and
a
liar
he
was
up
at
the
pint
that
mornin
i
live
up
there
do
i
well
i
was
up
there
and
he
was
up
there
i
see
him
there
he
come
in
a
canoe
along
with
tim
collins
and
a
boy
the
doctor
he
up
and
says
would
you
know
the
boy
again
if
you
was
to
see
him
hines
i
reckon
i
would
but
i
do
know
why
yonder
he
is
now
i
know
him
perfectly
easy
it
was
me
he
pointed
at
the
doctor
says
neighbors
i
do
know
whether
the
new
couple
is
frauds
or
not
but
if
two
ai
frauds
i
am
an
idiot
that
all
i
think
our
duty
to
see
that
they
do
get
away
from
here
till
we
looked
into
this
thing
come
along
hines
come
along
the
rest
of
you
take
these
fellows
to
the
tavern
and
affront
them
with
couple
and
i
reckon
we
find
out
before
we
get
through
it
was
nuts
for
the
crowd
though
maybe
not
for
the
king
friends
so
we
all
started
it
was
about
sundown
the
doctor
he
led
me
along
by
the
hand
and
was
plenty
kind
enough
but
he
never
let
go
my
hand
we
all
got
in
a
big
room
in
the
hotel
and
lit
up
some
candles
and
fetched
in
the
new
couple
first
the
doctor
says
i
do
wish
to
be
too
hard
on
these
two
men
but
i
think
frauds
and
they
may
have
complices
that
we
do
know
nothing
about
if
they
have
wo
the
complices
get
away
with
that
bag
of
gold
peter
wilks
left
it
ai
unlikely
if
these
men
ai
frauds
they
object
to
sending
for
that
money
and
letting
us
keep
it
till
they
prove
they
all
right
ai
that
so
everybody
agreed
to
that
so
i
judged
they
had
our
gang
in
a
pretty
tight
place
right
at
the
outstart
but
the
king
he
only
looked
sorrowful
and
says
gentlemen
i
wish
the
money
was
there
for
i
ai
got
no
disposition
to
throw
anything
in
the
way
of
a
fair
open
investigation
o
this
misable
business
but
alas
the
money
there
you
send
and
see
if
you
want
to
where
is
it
then
well
when
my
niece
give
it
to
me
to
keep
for
her
i
took
and
hid
it
inside
o
the
straw
tick
o
my
bed
not
wishin
to
bank
it
for
the
few
days
we
be
here
and
considerin
the
bed
a
safe
place
we
not
used
to
niggers
and
honest
like
servants
in
england
the
niggers
stole
it
the
very
next
mornin
after
i
had
went
and
when
i
sold
i
had
missed
the
money
yit
so
they
got
clean
away
with
it
my
servant
here
tell
you
it
gentlemen
the
doctor
and
several
said
shucks
and
i
see
nobody
altogether
believe
him
one
man
asked
me
if
i
see
the
niggers
steal
it
i
said
no
but
i
see
them
sneaking
out
of
the
room
and
hustling
away
and
i
never
thought
nothing
only
i
reckoned
they
was
afraid
they
had
waked
up
my
master
and
was
trying
to
get
away
before
he
made
trouble
with
them
that
was
all
they
asked
me
then
the
doctor
whirls
on
me
and
says
are
english
too
i
says
yes
and
him
and
some
others
laughed
and
said
stuff
well
then
they
sailed
in
on
the
general
investigation
and
there
we
had
it
up
and
down
hour
in
hour
out
and
nobody
never
said
a
word
about
supper
nor
ever
seemed
to
think
about
it
and
so
they
kept
it
up
and
kept
it
up
and
it
the
worst
thing
you
ever
see
they
made
the
king
tell
his
yarn
and
they
made
the
old
gentleman
tell
and
anybody
but
a
lot
of
prejudiced
chuckleheads
would
that
the
old
gentleman
was
spinning
truth
and
one
lies
and
by
and
by
they
had
me
up
to
tell
what
i
knowed
the
king
he
give
me
a
look
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
so
i
knowed
enough
to
talk
on
the
right
side
i
begun
to
tell
about
sheffield
and
how
we
lived
there
and
all
about
the
english
wilkses
and
so
on
but
i
did
get
pretty
fur
till
the
doctor
begun
to
laugh
and
levi
bell
the
lawyer
says
set
down
my
boy
i
would
strain
myself
if
i
was
you
i
reckon
you
ai
used
to
lying
it
do
seem
to
come
handy
what
you
want
is
practice
you
do
it
pretty
awkward
i
did
care
nothing
for
the
compliment
but
i
was
glad
to
be
let
off
anyway
the
doctor
he
started
to
say
something
and
turns
and
says
if
you
been
in
town
at
first
levi
bell
the
king
broke
in
and
reached
out
his
hand
and
says
why
is
this
my
poor
dead
brother
old
friend
that
he
wrote
so
often
about
the
lawyer
and
him
shook
hands
and
the
lawyer
smiled
and
looked
pleased
and
they
talked
right
along
awhile
and
then
got
to
one
side
and
talked
low
and
at
last
the
lawyer
speaks
up
and
says
that
fix
it
i
take
the
order
and
send
it
along
with
your
brother
and
then
they
know
it
all
right
so
they
got
some
paper
and
a
pen
and
the
king
he
set
down
and
twisted
his
head
to
one
side
and
chawed
his
tongue
and
scrawled
off
something
and
then
they
give
the
pen
to
the
duke
and
then
for
the
first
time
the
duke
looked
sick
but
he
took
the
pen
and
wrote
so
then
the
lawyer
turns
to
the
new
old
gentleman
and
says
you
and
your
brother
please
write
a
line
or
two
and
sign
your
names
the
old
gentleman
wrote
but
nobody
could
read
it
the
lawyer
looked
powerful
astonished
and
says
well
it
beats
and
snaked
a
lot
of
old
letters
out
of
his
pocket
and
examined
them
and
then
examined
the
old
man
writing
and
then
again
and
then
says
these
old
letters
is
from
harvey
wilks
and
here
two
handwritings
and
anybody
can
see
did
write
them
the
king
and
the
duke
looked
sold
and
foolish
i
tell
you
to
see
how
the
lawyer
had
took
them
in
and
here
old
gentleman
handwriting
and
anybody
can
tell
easy
enough
did
write
them
fact
is
the
scratches
he
makes
properly
at
all
now
here
some
letters
from
the
new
old
gentleman
says
if
you
please
let
me
explain
nobody
can
read
my
hand
but
my
brother
there
so
he
copies
for
me
it
hand
you
got
there
not
mine
says
the
lawyer
this
a
state
of
things
i
got
some
of
william
letters
too
so
if
you
get
him
to
write
a
line
or
so
we
can
com
he
write
with
his
left
hand
says
the
old
gentleman
if
he
could
use
his
right
hand
you
would
see
that
he
wrote
his
own
letters
and
mine
too
look
at
both
please
they
by
the
same
hand
the
lawyer
done
it
and
says
i
believe
it
so
and
if
it
ai
so
there
a
heap
stronger
resemblance
than
i
noticed
before
anyway
well
well
well
i
thought
we
was
right
on
the
track
of
a
slution
but
it
gone
to
grass
partly
but
anyway
thing
is
proved
two
either
of
wilkses
and
he
wagged
his
head
towards
the
king
and
the
duke
well
what
do
you
think
that
old
fool
would
give
in
indeed
he
would
said
it
war
no
fair
test
said
his
brother
william
was
the
cussedest
joker
in
the
world
and
to
write
see
william
was
going
to
play
one
of
his
jokes
the
minute
he
put
the
pen
to
paper
and
so
he
warmed
up
and
went
warbling
right
along
till
he
was
actuly
beginning
to
believe
what
he
was
saying
but
pretty
soon
the
new
gentleman
broke
in
and
says
i
thought
of
something
is
there
anybody
here
that
helped
to
lay
out
my
br
helped
to
lay
out
the
late
peter
wilks
for
burying
yes
says
somebody
me
and
ab
turner
done
it
we
both
here
then
the
old
man
turns
toward
the
king
and
says
peraps
this
gentleman
can
tell
me
what
was
tattooed
on
his
breast
blamed
if
the
king
did
have
to
brace
up
mighty
quick
or
he
squshed
down
like
a
bluff
bank
that
the
river
has
cut
under
it
took
him
so
sudden
and
mind
you
it
was
a
thing
that
was
calculated
to
make
most
sqush
to
get
fetched
such
a
solid
one
as
that
without
any
notice
because
how
was
going
to
know
what
was
tattooed
on
the
man
he
whitened
a
little
he
could
help
it
and
it
was
mighty
still
in
there
and
everybody
bending
a
little
forwards
and
gazing
at
him
says
i
to
myself
he
throw
up
the
sponge
there
ai
no
more
use
well
did
he
a
body
ca
hardly
believe
it
but
he
did
i
reckon
he
thought
he
keep
the
thing
up
till
he
tired
them
people
out
so
they
thin
out
and
him
and
the
duke
could
break
loose
and
get
away
anyway
he
set
there
and
pretty
soon
he
begun
to
smile
and
says
mf
it
a
tough
question
it
sir
i
tell
you
what
tattooed
on
his
breast
it
jest
a
small
thin
blue
arrow
that
what
it
is
and
if
you
do
look
clost
you
ca
see
it
what
do
you
say
hey
well
never
see
anything
like
that
old
blister
for
clean
cheek
the
new
old
gentleman
turns
brisk
towards
ab
turner
and
his
pard
and
his
eye
lights
up
like
he
judged
he
got
the
king
time
and
says
there
you
heard
what
he
said
was
there
any
such
mark
on
peter
wilks
breast
both
of
them
spoke
up
and
says
we
did
see
no
such
mark
good
says
the
old
gentleman
now
what
you
see
on
his
breast
was
a
small
dim
p
and
a
b
which
is
an
initial
he
dropped
when
he
was
young
and
a
w
and
dashes
between
them
so
p
b
w
and
he
marked
them
that
way
on
a
piece
of
paper
come
ai
that
what
you
saw
both
of
them
spoke
up
again
and
says
no
we
we
never
seen
any
marks
at
all
well
everybody
in
a
state
of
mind
now
and
they
sings
out
the
whole
of
frauds
le
duck
le
drown
le
ride
on
a
rail
and
everybody
was
whooping
at
once
and
there
was
a
rattling
powwow
but
the
lawyer
he
jumps
on
the
table
and
yells
and
says
gentlemen
hear
me
just
a
word
just
a
word
if
you
please
there
one
way
yet
let
go
and
dig
up
the
corpse
and
look
that
took
them
hooray
they
all
shouted
and
was
starting
right
off
but
the
lawyer
and
the
doctor
sung
out
hold
on
hold
on
collar
all
these
four
men
and
the
boy
and
fetch
along
too
we
do
it
they
all
shouted
and
if
we
do
find
them
marks
we
lynch
the
whole
gang
i
scared
now
i
tell
you
but
there
war
no
getting
away
you
know
they
gripped
us
all
and
marched
us
right
along
straight
for
the
graveyard
which
was
a
mile
and
a
half
down
the
river
and
the
whole
town
at
our
heels
for
we
made
noise
enough
and
it
was
only
nine
in
the
evening
as
we
went
by
our
house
i
wished
i
had
sent
mary
jane
out
of
town
because
now
if
i
could
tip
her
the
wink
she
light
out
and
save
me
and
blow
on
our
well
we
swarmed
along
down
the
river
road
just
carrying
on
like
wildcats
and
to
make
it
more
scary
the
sky
was
darking
up
and
the
lightning
beginning
to
wink
and
flitter
and
the
wind
to
shiver
amongst
the
leaves
this
was
the
most
awful
trouble
and
most
dangersome
i
ever
was
in
and
i
was
kinder
stunned
everything
was
going
so
different
from
what
i
had
allowed
for
stead
of
being
fixed
so
i
could
take
my
own
time
if
i
wanted
to
and
see
all
the
fun
and
have
mary
jane
at
my
back
to
save
me
and
set
me
free
when
the
come
here
was
nothing
in
the
world
betwixt
me
and
sudden
death
but
just
them
if
they
did
find
them
i
could
bear
to
think
about
it
and
yet
somehow
i
could
think
about
nothing
else
it
got
darker
and
darker
and
it
was
a
beautiful
time
to
give
the
crowd
the
slip
but
that
big
husky
had
me
by
the
wrist
hines
and
a
body
might
as
well
try
to
give
goliar
the
slip
he
dragged
me
right
along
he
was
so
excited
and
i
had
to
run
to
keep
up
when
they
got
there
they
swarmed
into
the
graveyard
and
washed
over
it
like
an
overflow
and
when
they
got
to
the
grave
they
found
they
had
about
a
hundred
times
as
many
shovels
as
they
wanted
but
nobody
had
thought
to
fetch
a
lantern
but
they
sailed
into
digging
anyway
by
the
flicker
of
the
lightning
and
sent
a
man
to
the
nearest
house
a
half
a
mile
off
to
borrow
one
so
they
dug
and
dug
like
everything
and
it
got
awful
dark
and
the
rain
started
and
the
wind
swished
and
swushed
along
and
the
lightning
come
brisker
and
brisker
and
the
thunder
boomed
but
them
people
never
took
no
notice
of
it
they
was
so
full
of
this
business
and
one
minute
you
could
see
everything
and
every
face
in
that
big
crowd
and
the
shovelfuls
of
dirt
sailing
up
out
of
the
grave
and
the
next
second
the
dark
wiped
it
all
out
and
you
could
see
nothing
at
all
at
last
they
got
out
the
coffin
and
begun
to
unscrew
the
lid
and
then
such
another
crowding
and
shouldering
and
shoving
as
there
was
to
scrouge
in
and
get
a
sight
you
never
see
and
in
the
dark
that
way
it
was
awful
hines
he
hurt
my
wrist
dreadful
pulling
and
tugging
so
and
i
reckon
he
clean
forgot
i
was
in
the
world
he
was
so
excited
and
panting
all
of
a
sudden
the
lightning
let
go
a
perfect
sluice
of
white
glare
and
somebody
sings
out
by
the
living
jingo
here
the
bag
of
gold
on
his
breast
hines
let
out
a
whoop
like
everybody
else
and
dropped
my
wrist
and
give
a
big
surge
to
bust
his
way
in
and
get
a
look
and
the
way
i
lit
out
and
shinned
for
the
road
in
the
dark
there
ai
nobody
can
tell
i
had
the
road
all
to
myself
and
i
fairly
flew
leastways
i
had
it
all
to
myself
except
the
solid
dark
and
the
glares
and
the
buzzing
of
the
rain
and
the
thrashing
of
the
wind
and
the
splitting
of
the
thunder
and
sure
as
you
are
born
i
did
clip
it
along
when
i
struck
the
town
i
see
there
war
nobody
out
in
the
storm
so
i
never
hunted
for
no
back
streets
but
humped
it
straight
through
the
main
one
and
when
i
begun
to
get
towards
our
house
i
aimed
my
eye
and
set
it
no
light
there
the
house
all
dark
which
made
me
feel
sorry
and
disappointed
i
did
know
why
but
at
last
just
as
i
was
sailing
by
comes
the
light
in
mary
jane
window
and
my
heart
swelled
up
sudden
like
to
bust
and
the
same
second
the
house
and
all
was
behind
me
in
the
dark
and
was
ever
going
to
be
before
me
no
more
in
this
world
she
the
best
girl
i
ever
see
and
had
the
most
sand
the
minute
i
was
far
enough
above
the
town
to
see
i
could
make
the
towhead
i
begun
to
look
sharp
for
a
boat
to
borrow
and
the
first
time
the
lightning
showed
me
one
that
was
chained
i
snatched
it
and
shoved
it
was
a
canoe
and
war
fastened
with
nothing
but
a
rope
the
towhead
was
a
rattling
big
distance
off
away
out
there
in
the
middle
of
the
river
but
i
did
lose
no
time
and
when
i
struck
the
raft
at
last
i
was
so
fagged
i
would
just
laid
down
to
blow
and
gasp
if
i
could
afforded
it
but
i
did
as
i
sprung
aboard
i
sung
out
out
with
you
jim
and
set
her
loose
glory
be
to
goodness
shut
of
them
jim
lit
out
and
was
for
me
with
both
arms
spread
he
was
so
full
of
joy
but
when
i
glimpsed
him
in
the
lightning
my
heart
shot
up
in
my
mouth
and
i
went
overboard
backwards
for
i
forgot
he
was
old
king
lear
and
a
drownded
all
in
one
and
it
most
scared
the
livers
and
lights
out
of
me
but
jim
fished
me
out
and
was
going
to
hug
me
and
bless
me
and
so
on
he
was
so
glad
i
was
back
and
we
was
shut
of
the
king
and
the
duke
but
i
says
not
now
have
it
for
breakfast
have
it
for
breakfast
cut
loose
and
let
her
slide
so
in
two
seconds
away
we
went
down
the
river
and
it
seem
so
good
to
be
free
again
and
all
by
ourselves
on
the
big
river
and
nobody
to
bother
us
i
had
to
skip
around
a
bit
and
jump
up
and
crack
my
heels
a
few
times
i
could
help
it
but
about
the
third
crack
i
noticed
a
sound
that
i
knowed
mighty
well
and
held
my
breath
and
listened
and
waited
and
sure
enough
when
the
next
flash
busted
out
over
the
water
here
they
come
and
just
to
their
oars
and
making
their
skiff
hum
it
was
the
king
and
the
duke
so
i
wilted
right
down
onto
the
planks
then
and
give
up
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
from
crying
chapter
xxx
when
they
got
aboard
the
king
went
for
me
and
shook
me
by
the
collar
and
says
tryin
to
give
us
the
slip
was
ye
you
pup
tired
of
our
company
hey
i
says
no
your
majesty
we
war
do
your
majesty
quick
then
and
tell
us
what
your
idea
or
i
shake
the
insides
out
o
you
honest
i
tell
you
everything
just
as
it
happened
your
majesty
the
man
that
had
of
me
was
very
good
to
me
and
kept
saying
he
had
a
boy
about
as
big
as
me
that
died
last
year
and
he
was
sorry
to
see
a
boy
in
such
a
dangerous
fix
and
when
they
was
all
took
by
surprise
by
finding
the
gold
and
made
a
rush
for
the
coffin
he
lets
go
of
me
and
whispers
it
now
or
they
hang
ye
sure
and
i
lit
out
it
did
seem
no
good
for
to
stay
i
could
do
nothing
and
i
did
want
to
be
if
i
could
get
away
so
i
never
stopped
running
till
i
found
the
canoe
and
when
i
got
here
i
told
jim
to
hurry
or
they
catch
me
and
hang
me
yet
and
said
i
was
afeard
you
and
the
duke
was
alive
now
and
i
was
awful
sorry
and
so
was
jim
and
was
awful
glad
when
we
see
you
coming
you
may
ask
jim
if
i
did
jim
said
it
was
so
and
the
king
told
him
to
shut
up
and
said
oh
yes
it
likely
and
shook
me
up
again
and
said
he
reckoned
he
drownd
me
but
the
duke
says
leggo
the
boy
you
old
idiot
would
done
any
different
did
you
inquire
around
for
when
you
got
loose
i
do
remember
it
so
the
king
let
go
of
me
and
begun
to
cuss
that
town
and
everybody
in
it
but
the
duke
says
you
better
a
blame
sight
give
a
good
cussing
for
the
one
that
entitled
to
it
most
you
hai
done
a
thing
from
the
start
that
had
any
sense
in
it
except
coming
out
so
cool
and
cheeky
with
that
imaginary
mark
that
bright
it
was
right
down
bully
and
it
was
the
thing
that
saved
us
for
if
it
had
been
for
that
they
jailed
us
till
them
englishmen
baggage
come
and
then
the
penitentiary
you
bet
but
that
trick
took
to
the
graveyard
and
the
gold
done
us
a
still
bigger
kindness
for
if
the
excited
fools
had
let
go
all
holts
and
made
that
rush
to
get
a
look
we
slept
in
our
cravats
cravats
warranted
to
too
longer
than
need
they
was
still
a
minute
thinking
then
the
king
says
kind
of
like
mf
and
we
reckoned
the
stole
it
that
made
me
squirm
yes
says
the
duke
kinder
slow
and
deliberate
and
sarcastic
did
after
about
a
half
a
minute
the
king
drawls
out
leastways
i
did
the
duke
says
the
same
way
on
the
contrary
did
the
king
kind
of
ruffles
up
and
says
looky
here
bilgewater
you
referrin
to
the
duke
says
pretty
brisk
when
it
comes
to
that
maybe
you
let
me
ask
what
was
referring
to
shucks
says
the
king
very
sarcastic
but
do
know
maybe
you
was
asleep
and
did
know
what
you
was
about
the
duke
bristles
up
now
and
says
oh
let
on
this
cussed
nonsense
do
you
take
me
for
a
fool
do
you
reckon
i
know
who
hid
that
money
in
that
coffin
sir
i
know
you
know
because
you
done
it
yourself
it
a
lie
and
the
duke
went
for
him
the
king
sings
out
take
hands
off
leggo
my
throat
i
take
it
all
back
the
duke
says
well
you
just
own
up
first
that
you
hide
that
money
there
intending
to
give
me
the
slip
one
of
these
days
and
come
back
and
dig
it
up
and
have
it
all
to
yourself
wait
jest
a
minute
duke
answer
me
this
one
question
honest
and
fair
if
you
did
put
the
money
there
say
it
and
i
you
and
take
back
everything
i
said
you
old
scoundrel
i
did
and
you
know
i
did
there
now
well
then
i
you
but
answer
me
only
jest
this
one
more
now
git
mad
did
you
have
it
in
your
mind
to
hook
the
money
and
hide
it
the
duke
never
said
nothing
for
a
little
bit
then
he
says
well
i
do
care
if
i
i
did
it
anyway
but
you
not
only
had
it
in
mind
to
do
it
but
you
it
i
wisht
i
never
die
if
i
done
it
duke
and
that
honest
i
say
i
war
goin
to
do
it
because
i
but
you
i
mean
somebody
got
in
ahead
o
me
it
a
lie
you
done
it
and
you
got
to
you
done
it
or
the
king
began
to
gurgle
and
then
he
gasps
out
i
up
i
was
very
glad
to
hear
him
say
that
it
made
me
feel
much
more
easier
than
what
i
was
feeling
before
so
the
duke
took
his
hands
off
and
says
if
you
ever
deny
it
again
i
drown
you
it
for
you
to
set
there
and
blubber
like
a
baby
it
fitten
for
you
after
the
way
you
acted
i
never
see
such
an
old
ostrich
for
wanting
to
gobble
everything
and
i
you
all
the
time
like
you
was
my
own
father
you
ought
to
been
ashamed
of
yourself
to
stand
by
and
hear
it
saddled
on
to
a
lot
of
poor
niggers
and
you
never
say
a
word
for
it
makes
me
feel
ridiculous
to
think
i
was
soft
enough
to
that
rubbage
cuss
you
i
can
see
now
why
you
was
so
anxious
to
make
up
the
deffisit
you
wanted
to
get
what
money
i
got
out
of
the
and
one
thing
or
another
and
scoop
it
the
king
says
timid
and
still
why
duke
it
was
you
that
said
make
up
the
deffersit
it
war
me
dry
up
i
do
want
to
hear
no
more
out
of
you
says
the
duke
and
you
see
what
you
by
it
they
got
all
their
own
money
back
and
all
of
but
a
shekel
or
two
to
bed
and
do
you
deffersit
no
more
deffersits
long
live
so
the
king
sneaked
into
the
wigwam
and
took
to
his
bottle
for
comfort
and
before
long
the
duke
tackled
bottle
and
so
in
about
a
half
an
hour
they
was
as
thick
as
thieves
again
and
the
tighter
they
got
the
lovinger
they
got
and
went
off
in
each
other
arms
they
both
got
powerful
mellow
but
i
noticed
the
king
did
get
mellow
enough
to
forget
to
remember
to
not
deny
about
hiding
the
again
that
made
me
feel
easy
and
satisfied
of
course
when
they
got
to
snoring
we
had
a
long
gabble
and
i
told
jim
everything
chapter
xxxi
we
das
stop
again
at
any
town
for
days
and
days
kept
right
along
down
the
river
we
was
down
south
in
the
warm
weather
now
and
a
mighty
long
ways
from
home
we
begun
to
come
to
trees
with
spanish
moss
on
them
hanging
down
from
the
limbs
like
long
gray
beards
it
was
the
first
i
ever
see
it
growing
and
it
made
the
woods
look
solemn
and
dismal
so
now
the
frauds
reckoned
they
was
out
of
danger
and
they
begun
to
work
the
villages
again
first
they
done
a
lecture
on
temperance
but
they
did
make
enough
for
them
both
to
get
drunk
on
then
in
another
village
they
started
a
but
they
did
know
no
more
how
to
dance
than
a
kangaroo
does
so
the
first
prance
they
made
the
general
public
jumped
in
and
pranced
them
out
of
town
another
time
they
tried
to
go
at
yellocution
but
they
did
yellocute
long
till
the
audience
got
up
and
give
them
a
solid
good
cussing
and
made
them
skip
out
they
tackled
missionarying
and
mesmerizing
and
doctoring
and
telling
fortunes
and
a
little
of
everything
but
they
could
seem
to
have
no
luck
so
at
last
they
got
just
about
dead
broke
and
laid
around
the
raft
as
she
floated
along
thinking
and
thinking
and
never
saying
nothing
by
the
half
a
day
at
a
time
and
dreadful
blue
and
desperate
and
at
last
they
took
a
change
and
begun
to
lay
their
heads
together
in
the
wigwam
and
talk
low
and
confidential
two
or
three
hours
at
a
time
jim
and
me
got
uneasy
we
did
like
the
look
of
it
we
judged
they
was
studying
up
some
kind
of
worse
deviltry
than
ever
we
turned
it
over
and
over
and
at
last
we
made
up
our
minds
they
was
going
to
break
into
somebody
house
or
store
or
was
going
into
the
business
or
something
so
then
we
was
pretty
scared
and
made
up
an
agreement
that
we
would
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
such
actions
and
if
we
ever
got
the
least
show
we
would
give
them
the
cold
shake
and
clear
out
and
leave
them
behind
well
early
one
morning
we
hid
the
raft
in
a
good
safe
place
about
two
mile
below
a
little
bit
of
a
shabby
village
named
pikesville
and
the
king
he
went
ashore
and
told
us
all
to
stay
hid
whilst
he
went
up
to
town
and
smelt
around
to
see
if
anybody
had
got
any
wind
of
the
royal
nonesuch
there
yet
house
to
rob
you
says
i
to
myself
and
when
you
get
through
robbing
it
you
come
back
here
and
wonder
what
has
become
of
me
and
jim
and
the
raft
and
you
have
to
take
it
out
in
wondering
and
he
said
if
he
war
back
by
midday
the
duke
and
me
would
know
it
was
all
right
and
we
was
to
come
along
so
we
stayed
where
we
was
the
duke
he
fretted
and
sweated
around
and
was
in
a
mighty
sour
way
he
scolded
us
for
everything
and
we
could
seem
to
do
nothing
right
he
found
fault
with
every
little
thing
something
was
sure
i
was
good
and
glad
when
midday
come
and
no
king
we
could
have
a
change
anyway
and
maybe
a
chance
for
chance
on
top
of
it
so
me
and
the
duke
went
up
to
the
village
and
hunted
around
there
for
the
king
and
by
and
by
we
found
him
in
the
back
room
of
a
little
low
doggery
very
tight
and
a
lot
of
loafers
bullyragging
him
for
sport
and
he
and
with
all
his
might
and
so
tight
he
could
walk
and
could
do
nothing
to
them
the
duke
he
begun
to
abuse
him
for
an
old
fool
and
the
king
begun
to
sass
back
and
the
minute
they
was
fairly
at
it
i
lit
out
and
shook
the
reefs
out
of
my
hind
legs
and
spun
down
the
river
road
like
a
deer
for
i
see
our
chance
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
it
would
be
a
long
day
before
they
ever
see
me
and
jim
again
i
got
down
there
all
out
of
breath
but
loaded
up
with
joy
and
sung
out
set
her
loose
jim
we
all
right
now
but
there
war
no
answer
and
nobody
come
out
of
the
wigwam
jim
was
gone
i
set
up
a
shout
and
then
another
and
then
another
one
and
run
this
way
and
that
in
the
woods
whooping
and
screeching
but
it
war
no
use
old
jim
was
gone
then
i
set
down
and
cried
i
help
it
but
i
could
set
still
long
pretty
soon
i
went
out
on
the
road
trying
to
think
what
i
better
do
and
i
run
across
a
boy
walking
and
asked
him
if
he
seen
a
strange
nigger
dressed
so
and
so
and
he
says
yes
whereabouts
says
i
down
to
silas
phelps
place
two
mile
below
here
he
a
runaway
nigger
and
they
got
him
was
you
looking
for
him
you
bet
i
ai
i
run
across
him
in
the
woods
about
an
hour
or
two
ago
and
he
said
if
i
hollered
he
cut
my
livers
out
and
told
me
to
lay
down
and
stay
where
i
was
and
i
done
it
been
there
ever
since
afeard
to
come
out
well
he
says
you
need
be
afeard
no
more
becuz
they
got
him
he
run
off
f
down
south
it
a
good
job
they
got
him
well
i
there
two
hundred
dollars
dollars
reward
on
him
it
like
picking
up
money
the
road
yes
it
is
and
i
could
had
it
if
i
been
big
enough
i
see
him
who
nailed
him
it
was
an
old
fellow
a
stranger
and
he
sold
out
his
chance
in
him
for
forty
dollars
becuz
he
got
to
go
up
the
river
and
ca
wait
think
o
that
now
you
bet
wait
if
it
was
seven
year
that
me
every
time
says
i
but
maybe
his
chance
ai
worth
no
more
than
that
if
he
sell
it
so
cheap
maybe
there
something
ai
straight
about
it
but
it
though
straight
as
a
string
i
see
the
handbill
myself
it
tells
all
about
him
to
a
dot
paints
him
like
a
picture
and
tells
the
plantation
he
frum
below
they
ai
no
trouble
speculation
you
bet
you
say
gim
me
a
chaw
tobacker
wo
ye
i
did
have
none
so
he
left
i
went
to
the
raft
and
set
down
in
the
wigwam
to
think
but
i
could
come
to
nothing
i
thought
till
i
wore
my
head
sore
but
i
could
see
no
way
out
of
the
trouble
after
all
this
long
journey
and
after
all
we
done
for
them
scoundrels
here
it
was
all
come
to
nothing
everything
all
busted
up
and
ruined
because
they
could
have
the
heart
to
serve
jim
such
a
trick
as
that
and
make
him
a
slave
again
all
his
life
and
amongst
strangers
too
for
forty
dirty
dollars
once
i
said
to
myself
it
would
be
a
thousand
times
better
for
jim
to
be
a
slave
at
home
where
his
family
was
as
long
as
he
to
be
a
slave
and
so
i
better
write
a
letter
to
tom
sawyer
and
tell
him
to
tell
miss
watson
where
he
was
but
i
soon
give
up
that
notion
for
two
things
she
be
mad
and
disgusted
at
his
rascality
and
ungratefulness
for
leaving
her
and
so
she
sell
him
straight
down
the
river
again
and
if
she
did
everybody
naturally
despises
an
ungrateful
nigger
and
they
make
jim
feel
it
all
the
time
and
so
he
feel
ornery
and
disgraced
and
then
think
of
it
would
get
all
around
that
huck
finn
helped
a
nigger
to
get
his
freedom
and
if
i
was
ever
to
see
anybody
from
that
town
again
i
be
ready
to
get
down
and
lick
his
boots
for
shame
that
just
the
way
a
person
does
a
thing
and
then
he
do
want
to
take
no
consequences
of
it
thinks
as
long
as
he
can
hide
it
ai
no
disgrace
that
was
my
fix
exactly
the
more
i
studied
about
this
the
more
my
conscience
went
to
grinding
me
and
the
more
wicked
and
and
ornery
i
got
to
feeling
and
at
last
when
it
hit
me
all
of
a
sudden
that
here
was
the
plain
hand
of
providence
slapping
me
in
the
face
and
letting
me
know
my
wickedness
was
being
watched
all
the
time
from
up
there
in
heaven
whilst
i
was
stealing
a
poor
old
woman
nigger
that
had
ever
done
me
no
harm
and
now
was
showing
me
there
one
that
always
on
the
lookout
and
ai
to
allow
no
such
miserable
doings
to
go
only
just
so
fur
and
no
further
i
most
dropped
in
my
tracks
i
was
so
scared
well
i
tried
the
best
i
could
to
kinder
soften
it
up
somehow
for
myself
by
saying
i
was
brung
up
wicked
and
so
i
war
so
much
to
blame
but
something
inside
of
me
kept
saying
there
was
the
you
could
gone
to
it
and
if
you
done
it
they
learnt
you
there
that
people
that
acts
as
i
been
acting
about
that
nigger
goes
to
everlasting
fire
it
made
me
shiver
and
i
about
made
up
my
mind
to
pray
and
see
if
i
could
try
to
quit
being
the
kind
of
a
boy
i
was
and
be
better
so
i
kneeled
down
but
the
words
would
come
why
would
they
it
war
no
use
to
try
and
hide
it
from
him
nor
from
neither
i
knowed
very
well
why
they
would
come
it
was
because
my
heart
war
right
it
was
because
i
war
square
it
was
because
i
was
playing
double
i
was
letting
to
give
up
sin
but
away
inside
of
me
i
was
holding
on
to
the
biggest
one
of
all
i
was
trying
to
make
my
mouth
i
would
do
the
right
thing
and
the
clean
thing
and
go
and
write
to
that
nigger
owner
and
tell
where
he
was
but
deep
down
in
me
i
knowed
it
was
a
lie
and
he
knowed
it
you
ca
pray
a
lie
i
found
that
out
so
i
was
full
of
trouble
full
as
i
could
be
and
did
know
what
to
do
at
last
i
had
an
idea
and
i
says
i
go
and
write
the
letter
and
then
see
if
i
can
pray
why
it
was
astonishing
the
way
i
felt
as
light
as
a
feather
right
straight
off
and
my
troubles
all
gone
so
i
got
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
all
glad
and
excited
and
set
down
and
wrote
miss
watson
your
runaway
nigger
jim
is
down
here
two
mile
below
pikesville
and
phelps
has
got
him
and
he
will
give
him
up
for
the
reward
if
you
send
huck
finn
i
felt
good
and
all
washed
clean
of
sin
for
the
first
time
i
had
ever
felt
so
in
my
life
and
i
knowed
i
could
pray
now
but
i
did
do
it
straight
off
but
laid
the
paper
down
and
set
there
thinking
thinking
how
good
it
was
all
this
happened
so
and
how
near
i
come
to
being
lost
and
going
to
hell
and
went
on
thinking
and
got
to
thinking
over
our
trip
down
the
river
and
i
see
jim
before
me
all
the
time
in
the
day
and
in
the
sometimes
moonlight
sometimes
storms
and
we
along
talking
and
singing
and
laughing
but
somehow
i
could
seem
to
strike
no
places
to
harden
me
against
him
but
only
the
other
kind
i
see
him
standing
my
watch
on
top
of
of
calling
me
so
i
could
go
on
sleeping
and
see
him
how
glad
he
was
when
i
come
back
out
of
the
fog
and
when
i
come
to
him
again
in
the
swamp
up
there
where
the
feud
was
and
times
and
would
always
call
me
honey
and
pet
me
and
do
everything
he
could
think
of
for
me
and
how
good
he
always
was
and
at
last
i
struck
the
time
i
saved
him
by
telling
the
men
we
had
smallpox
aboard
and
he
was
so
grateful
and
said
i
was
the
best
friend
old
jim
ever
had
in
the
world
and
the
one
he
got
now
and
then
i
happened
to
look
around
and
see
that
paper
it
was
a
close
place
i
took
it
up
and
held
it
in
my
hand
i
was
because
i
got
to
decide
forever
betwixt
two
things
and
i
knowed
it
i
studied
a
minute
sort
of
holding
my
breath
and
then
says
to
myself
all
right
then
i
to
hell
and
tore
it
up
it
was
awful
thoughts
and
awful
words
but
they
was
said
and
i
let
them
stay
said
and
never
thought
no
more
about
reforming
i
shoved
the
whole
thing
out
of
my
head
and
said
i
would
take
up
wickedness
again
which
was
in
my
line
being
brung
up
to
it
and
the
other
war
and
for
a
starter
i
would
go
to
work
and
steal
jim
out
of
slavery
again
and
if
i
could
think
up
anything
worse
i
would
do
that
too
because
as
long
as
i
was
in
and
in
for
good
i
might
as
well
go
the
whole
hog
then
i
set
to
thinking
over
how
to
get
at
it
and
turned
over
some
considerable
many
ways
in
my
mind
and
at
last
fixed
up
a
plan
that
suited
me
so
then
i
took
the
bearings
of
a
woody
island
that
was
down
the
river
a
piece
and
as
soon
as
it
was
fairly
dark
i
crept
out
with
my
raft
and
went
for
it
and
hid
it
there
and
then
turned
in
i
slept
the
night
through
and
got
up
before
it
was
light
and
had
my
breakfast
and
put
on
my
store
clothes
and
tied
up
some
others
and
one
thing
or
another
in
a
bundle
and
took
the
canoe
and
cleared
for
shore
i
landed
below
where
i
judged
was
phelps
place
and
hid
my
bundle
in
the
woods
and
then
filled
up
the
canoe
with
water
and
loaded
rocks
into
her
and
sunk
her
where
i
could
find
her
again
when
i
wanted
her
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
a
little
that
was
on
the
bank
then
i
struck
up
the
road
and
when
i
passed
the
mill
i
see
a
sign
on
it
phelps
sawmill
and
when
i
come
to
the
two
or
three
hundred
yards
further
along
i
kept
my
eyes
peeled
but
see
nobody
around
though
it
was
good
daylight
now
but
i
did
mind
because
i
did
want
to
see
nobody
just
yet
i
only
wanted
to
get
the
lay
of
the
land
according
to
my
plan
i
was
going
to
turn
up
there
from
the
village
not
from
below
so
i
just
took
a
look
and
shoved
along
straight
for
town
well
the
very
first
man
i
see
when
i
got
there
was
the
duke
he
was
sticking
up
a
bill
for
the
royal
nonesuch
performance
like
that
other
time
they
had
the
cheek
them
frauds
i
was
right
on
him
before
i
could
shirk
he
looked
astonished
and
says
where
come
from
then
he
says
kind
of
glad
and
eager
where
the
raft
got
her
in
a
good
place
i
says
why
that
just
what
i
was
going
to
ask
your
grace
then
he
did
look
so
joyful
and
says
what
was
your
idea
for
asking
he
says
well
i
says
when
i
see
the
king
in
that
doggery
yesterday
i
says
to
myself
we
ca
get
him
home
for
hours
till
he
soberer
so
i
went
around
town
to
put
in
the
time
and
wait
a
man
up
and
offered
me
ten
cents
to
help
him
pull
a
skiff
over
the
river
and
back
to
fetch
a
sheep
and
so
i
went
along
but
when
we
was
dragging
him
to
the
boat
and
the
man
left
me
of
the
rope
and
went
behind
him
to
shove
him
along
he
was
too
strong
for
me
and
jerked
loose
and
run
and
we
after
him
we
did
have
no
dog
and
so
we
had
to
chase
him
all
over
the
country
till
we
tired
him
out
we
never
got
him
till
dark
then
we
fetched
him
over
and
i
started
down
for
the
raft
when
i
got
there
and
see
it
was
gone
i
says
to
myself
got
into
trouble
and
had
to
leave
and
they
took
my
nigger
which
is
the
only
nigger
i
got
in
the
world
and
now
i
in
a
strange
country
and
ai
got
no
property
no
more
nor
nothing
and
no
way
to
make
my
living
so
i
set
down
and
cried
i
slept
in
the
woods
all
night
but
what
become
of
the
raft
then
and
jim
poor
jim
blamed
if
i
know
that
is
what
become
of
the
raft
that
old
fool
had
made
a
trade
and
got
forty
dollars
and
when
we
found
him
in
the
doggery
the
loafers
had
matched
with
him
and
got
every
cent
but
what
he
spent
for
whisky
and
when
i
got
him
home
late
last
night
and
found
the
raft
gone
we
said
little
rascal
has
stole
our
raft
and
shook
us
and
run
off
down
the
river
i
would
shake
my
would
i
the
only
nigger
i
had
in
the
world
and
the
only
property
we
never
thought
of
that
fact
is
i
reckon
we
come
to
consider
him
nigger
yes
we
did
consider
him
so
goodness
knows
we
had
trouble
enough
for
him
so
when
we
see
the
raft
was
gone
and
we
flat
broke
there
war
anything
for
it
but
to
try
the
another
shake
and
i
pegged
along
ever
since
dry
as
a
where
that
ten
cents
give
it
here
i
had
considerable
money
so
i
give
him
ten
cents
but
begged
him
to
spend
it
for
something
to
eat
and
give
me
some
because
it
was
all
the
money
i
had
and
i
had
had
nothing
to
eat
since
yesterday
he
never
said
nothing
the
next
minute
he
whirls
on
me
and
says
do
you
reckon
that
nigger
would
blow
on
us
we
skin
him
if
he
done
that
how
can
he

hai
he
run
off
no
that
old
fool

him
and
never
divided
with
me
and
the
money

i
says
and
begun
to
cry
why
he
was
nigger
and
that
was
my
money
where
is
he
i
want
my
nigger
well
you
ca

nigger
that
all
so
dry
up
your
blubbering
looky
here
do
you
think
venture
to
blow
on
us
blamed
if
i
think
i
trust
you
why
if
you
to
blow
on
us
he
stopped
but
i
never
see
the
duke
look
so
ugly
out
of
his
eyes
before
i
went
on
and
says
i
do
want
to
blow
on
nobody
and
i
ai
got
no
time
to
blow
nohow
i
got
to
turn
out
and
find
my
nigger
he
looked
kinder
bothered
and
stood
there
with
his
bills
fluttering
on
his
arm
thinking
and
wrinkling
up
his
forehead
at
last
he
says
i
tell
you
something
we
got
to
be
here
three
days
if
promise
you
wo
blow
and
wo
let
the
nigger
blow
i
tell
you
where
to
find
him
so
i
promised
and
he
says
a
farmer
by
the
name
of
silas
ph
and
then
he
stopped
you
see
he
started
to
tell
me
the
truth
but
when
he
stopped
that
way
and
begun
to
study
and
think
again
i
reckoned
he
was
changing
his
mind
and
so
he
was
he
would
trust
me
he
wanted
to
make
sure
of
having
me
out
of
the
way
the
whole
three
days
so
pretty
soon
he
says
the
man
that
bought
him
is
named
abram
foster
abram
foster
and
he
lives
forty
mile
back
here
in
the
country
on
the
road
to
lafayette
all
right
i
says
i
can
walk
it
in
three
days
and
i
start
this
very
afternoon
no
you
wo
you
start
and
do
you
lose
any
time
about
it
neither
nor
do
any
gabbling
by
the
way
just
keep
a
tight
tongue
in
your
head
and
move
right
along
and
then
you
wo
get
into
trouble
with
d
hear
that
was
the
order
i
wanted
and
that
was
the
one
i
played
for
i
wanted
to
be
left
free
to
work
my
plans
so
clear
out
he
says
and
you
can
tell
foster
whatever
you
want
to
maybe
you
can
get
him
to
believe
that
jim
your
nigger
some
idiots
do
require
documents
leastways
i
heard
there
such
down
south
here
and
when
you
tell
him
the
handbill
and
the
reward
bogus
maybe
he
believe
you
when
you
explain
to
him
what
the
idea
was
for
getting
out
go
now
and
tell
him
anything
you
want
to
but
mind
you
do
work
your
jaw
any
here
and
there
so
i
left
and
struck
for
the
back
country
i
did
look
around
but
i
kinder
felt
like
he
was
watching
me
but
i
knowed
i
could
tire
him
out
at
that
i
went
straight
out
in
the
country
as
much
as
a
mile
before
i
stopped
then
i
doubled
back
through
the
woods
towards
phelps
i
reckoned
i
better
start
in
on
my
plan
straight
off
without
fooling
around
because
i
wanted
to
stop
jim
mouth
till
these
fellows
could
get
away
i
did
want
no
trouble
with
their
kind
seen
all
i
wanted
to
of
them
and
wanted
to
get
entirely
shut
of
them
chapter
xxxii
when
i
got
there
it
was
all
still
and
and
hot
and
sunshiny
the
hands
was
gone
to
the
fields
and
there
was
them
kind
of
faint
dronings
of
bugs
and
flies
in
the
air
that
makes
it
seem
so
lonesome
and
like
everybody
dead
and
gone
and
if
a
breeze
fans
along
and
quivers
the
leaves
it
makes
you
feel
mournful
because
you
feel
like
it
spirits
whispering
spirits
that
been
dead
ever
so
many
years
and
you
always
think
they
talking
about
as
a
general
thing
it
makes
a
body
wish
was
dead
too
and
done
with
it
all
phelps
was
one
of
these
little
cotton
plantations
and
they
all
look
alike
a
rail
fence
round
a
yard
a
stile
made
out
of
logs
sawed
off
and
in
steps
like
barrels
of
a
different
length
to
climb
over
the
fence
with
and
for
the
women
to
stand
on
when
they
are
going
to
jump
onto
a
horse
some
sickly
in
the
big
yard
but
mostly
it
was
bare
and
smooth
like
an
old
hat
with
the
nap
rubbed
off
big
double
log
house
for
the
white
folks
hewed
logs
with
the
chinks
stopped
up
with
mud
or
mortar
and
these
been
whitewashed
some
time
or
another
kitchen
with
a
big
broad
open
but
roofed
passage
joining
it
to
the
house
log
smokehouse
back
of
the
kitchen
three
little
nigger
cabins
in
a
row
side
the
smokehouse
one
little
hut
all
by
itself
away
down
against
the
back
fence
and
some
outbuildings
down
a
piece
the
other
side
and
big
kettle
to
bile
soap
in
by
the
little
hut
bench
by
the
kitchen
door
with
bucket
of
water
and
a
gourd
hound
asleep
there
in
the
sun
more
hounds
asleep
round
about
about
three
shade
trees
away
off
in
a
corner
some
currant
bushes
and
gooseberry
bushes
in
one
place
by
the
fence
outside
of
the
fence
a
garden
and
a
watermelon
patch
then
the
begins
and
after
the
fields
the
woods
i
went
around
and
clumb
over
the
back
stile
by
the
and
started
for
the
kitchen
when
i
got
a
little
ways
i
heard
the
dim
hum
of
a
wailing
along
up
and
sinking
along
down
again
and
then
i
knowed
for
certain
i
wished
i
was
dead
for
that
the
lonesomest
sound
in
the
whole
world
i
went
right
along
not
fixing
up
any
particular
plan
but
just
trusting
to
providence
to
put
the
right
words
in
my
mouth
when
the
time
come
for
i
noticed
that
providence
always
did
put
the
right
words
in
my
mouth
if
i
left
it
alone
when
i
got
first
one
hound
and
then
another
got
up
and
went
for
me
and
of
course
i
stopped
and
faced
them
and
kept
still
and
such
another
powwow
as
they
made
in
a
quarter
of
a
minute
i
was
a
kind
of
a
hub
of
a
wheel
as
you
may
say
spokes
made
out
of
dogs
circle
of
fifteen
of
them
packed
together
around
me
with
their
necks
and
noses
stretched
up
towards
me
and
howling
and
more
you
could
see
them
sailing
over
fences
and
around
corners
from
a
nigger
woman
come
tearing
out
of
the
kitchen
with
a
in
her
hand
singing
out
begone
tige
you
spot
begone
sah
and
she
fetched
first
one
and
then
another
of
them
a
clip
and
sent
them
howling
and
then
the
rest
followed
and
the
next
second
half
of
them
come
back
wagging
their
tails
around
me
and
making
friends
with
me
there
ai
no
harm
in
a
hound
nohow
and
behind
the
woman
comes
a
little
nigger
girl
and
two
little
nigger
boys
without
anything
on
but
shirts
and
they
hung
on
to
their
mother
gown
and
peeped
out
from
behind
her
at
me
bashful
the
way
they
always
do
and
here
comes
the
white
woman
running
from
the
house
about
or
fifty
year
old
bareheaded
and
her
in
her
hand
and
behind
her
comes
her
little
white
children
acting
the
same
way
the
little
niggers
was
going
she
was
smiling
all
over
so
she
could
hardly
stand
and
says
it
at
last
it
i
out
with
a
yes
before
i
thought
she
grabbed
me
and
hugged
me
tight
and
then
gripped
me
by
both
hands
and
shook
and
shook
and
the
tears
come
in
her
eyes
and
run
down
over
and
she
could
seem
to
hug
and
shake
enough
and
kept
saying
you
do
look
as
much
like
your
mother
as
i
reckoned
you
would
but
law
sakes
i
do
care
for
that
i
so
glad
to
see
you
dear
dear
it
does
seem
like
i
could
eat
you
up
children
it
your
cousin
tom
tell
him
howdy
but
they
ducked
their
heads
and
put
their
fingers
in
their
mouths
and
hid
behind
her
so
she
run
on
lize
hurry
up
and
get
him
a
hot
breakfast
right
away
or
did
you
get
your
breakfast
on
the
boat
i
said
i
had
got
it
on
the
boat
so
then
she
started
for
the
house
leading
me
by
the
hand
and
the
children
tagging
after
when
we
got
there
she
set
me
down
in
a
chair
and
set
herself
down
on
a
little
low
stool
in
front
of
me
holding
both
of
my
hands
and
says
now
i
can
have
a
look
at
you
and
i
been
hungry
for
it
a
many
and
a
many
a
time
all
these
long
years
and
it
come
at
last
we
been
expecting
you
a
couple
of
days
and
more
what
you
boat
get
aground
yes
she
do
say
yes
say
aunt
sally
where
she
get
aground
i
did
rightly
know
what
to
say
because
i
did
know
whether
the
boat
would
be
coming
up
the
river
or
down
but
i
go
a
good
deal
on
instinct
and
my
instinct
said
she
would
be
coming
up
from
down
towards
orleans
that
did
help
me
much
though
for
i
did
know
the
names
of
bars
down
that
way
i
see
i
got
to
invent
a
bar
or
forget
the
name
of
the
one
we
got
aground
on
or
now
i
struck
an
idea
and
fetched
it
out
it
war
the
grounding
that
did
keep
us
back
but
a
little
we
blowed
out
a
good
gracious
anybody
hurt
no
killed
a
nigger
well
it
lucky
because
sometimes
people
do
get
hurt
two
years
ago
last
christmas
your
uncle
silas
was
coming
up
from
newrleans
on
the
old
lally
rook
and
she
blowed
out
a
and
crippled
a
man
and
i
think
he
died
afterwards
he
was
a
baptist
your
uncle
silas
knowed
a
family
in
baton
rouge
that
knowed
his
people
very
well

i
remember
now
he
die
mortification
set
in
and
they
had
to
amputate
him
but
it
did
save
him
yes
it
was
mortification
that
was
it
he
turned
blue
all
over
and
died
in
the
hope
of
a
glorious
resurrection
they
say
he
was
a
sight
to
look
at
your
uncle

up
to
the
town
every
day
to
fetch
you
and
he

the
old
man
grabbed
me
by
the
hand
and
shook
and
kept
on
shaking
and
all
the
time
how
the
woman
did
dance
around
and
laugh
and
cry
and
then
how
they
both
did
fire
off
questions
about
sid
and
mary
and
the
rest
of
the
tribe
but
if
they
was
joyful
it
war
nothing
to
what
i
was
for
it
was
like
being
born
again
i
was
so
glad
to
find
out
who
i
was
well
they
froze
to
me
for
two
hours
and
at
last
when
my
chin
was
so
tired
it
could
hardly
go
any
more
i
had
told
them
more
about
my
family
i
mean
the
sawyer
family
than
ever
happened
to
any
six
sawyer
families
and
i
explained
all
about
how
we
blowed
out
a
at
the
mouth
of
white
river
and
it
took
us
three
days
to
fix
it
which
was
all
right
and
worked
because
did
know
but
what
it
would
take
three
days
to
fix
it
if
i
called
it
a
bolthead
it
would
done
just
as
well
now
i
was
feeling
pretty
comfortable
all
down
one
side
and
pretty
uncomfortable
all
up
the
other
being
tom
sawyer
was
easy
and
comfortable
and
it
stayed
easy
and
comfortable
till
by
and
by
i
hear
a
steamboat
coughing
along
down
the
river
then
i
says
to
myself
tom
sawyer
comes
down
on
that
boat
and
he
steps
in
here
any
minute
and
sings
out
my
name
before
i
can
throw
him
a
wink
to
keep
quiet
well
i
could
it
that
way
it
would
do
at
all
i
must
go
up
the
road
and
waylay
him
so
i
told
the
folks
i
reckoned
i
would
go
up
to
the
town
and
fetch
down
my
baggage
the
old
gentleman
was
for
going
along
with
me
but
i
said
no
i
could
drive
the
horse
myself
and
i
druther
he
would
take
no
trouble
about
me
chapter
xxxiii
so
i
started
for
town
in
the
wagon
and
when
i
was
i
see
a
wagon
coming
and
sure
enough
it
was
tom
sawyer
and
i
stopped
and
waited
till
he
come
along
i
says
hold
on
and
it
stopped
alongside
and
his
mouth
opened
up
like
a
trunk
and
stayed
so
and
he
swallowed
two
or
three
times
like
a
person
that
got
a
dry
throat
and
then
says
i
hai
ever
done
you
no
harm
you
know
that
so
then
what
you
want
to
come
back
and
for
i
says
i
hai
come
back
i
hai
been
when
he
heard
my
voice
it
righted
him
up
some
but
he
war
quite
satisfied
yet
he
says
do
you
play
nothing
on
me
because
i
would
on
you
honest
injun
you
ai
a
ghost
honest
injun
i
ai
i
says
well
i
i
well
that
ought
to
settle
it
of
course
but
i
somehow
seem
to
understand
it
no
way
looky
here
war
you
ever
murdered
all
no
i
war
ever
murdered
at
all
i
played
it
on
them
you
come
in
here
and
feel
of
me
if
you
do
believe
me
so
he
done
it
and
it
satisfied
him
and
he
was
that
glad
to
see
me
again
he
did
know
what
to
do
and
he
wanted
to
know
all
about
it
right
off
because
it
was
a
grand
adventure
and
mysterious
and
so
it
hit
him
where
he
lived
but
i
said
leave
it
alone
till
by
and
by
and
told
his
driver
to
wait
and
we
drove
off
a
little
piece
and
i
told
him
the
kind
of
a
fix
i
was
in
and
what
did
he
reckon
we
better
do
he
said
let
him
alone
a
minute
and
do
disturb
him
so
he
thought
and
thought
and
pretty
soon
he
says
it
all
right
i
got
it
take
my
trunk
in
your
wagon
and
let
on
it
and
you
turn
back
and
fool
along
slow
so
as
to
get
to
the
house
about
the
time
you
ought
to
and
i
go
towards
town
a
piece
and
take
a
fresh
start
and
get
there
a
quarter
or
a
half
an
hour
after
you
and
you
need
let
on
to
know
me
at
first
i
says
all
right
but
wait
a
minute
there
one
more
thing
a
thing
that
do
know
but
me
and
that
is
there
a
nigger
here
that
i
to
steal
out
of
slavery
and
his
name
is
old
miss
watson
jim
he
says
what
why
jim
is
he
stopped
and
went
to
studying
i
says
know
what
you
say
you
say
it
dirty
business
but
what
if
it
is
low
down
and
i
to
steal
him
and
i
want
you
keep
mum
and
not
let
on
will
you
his
eye
lit
up
and
he
says
i
you
steal
him
well
i
let
go
all
holts
then
like
i
was
shot
it
was
the
most
astonishing
speech
i
ever
heard
and
i
bound
to
say
tom
sawyer
fell
considerable
in
my
estimation
only
i
could
believe
it
tom
sawyer
a
oh
shucks
i
says
you
joking
i
ai
joking
either
well
then
i
says
joking
or
no
joking
if
you
hear
anything
said
about
a
runaway
nigger
do
forget
to
remember
that
do
know
nothing
about
him
and
i
do
know
nothing
about
him
then
he
took
the
trunk
and
put
it
in
my
wagon
and
he
drove
off
his
way
and
i
drove
mine
but
of
course
i
forgot
all
about
driving
slow
on
accounts
of
being
glad
and
full
of
thinking
so
i
got
home
a
heap
too
quick
for
that
length
of
a
trip
the
old
gentleman
was
at
the
door
and
he
says
why
this
is
wonderful
whoever
would
thought
it
was
in
that
mare
to
do
it
i
wish
we
timed
her
and
she
hai
sweated
a
hair
not
a
hair
it
wonderful
why
i
would
take
a
hundred
dollars
for
that
horse
now
i
would
honest
and
yet
i
sold
her
for
fifteen
before
and
thought
was
all
she
was
worth
that
all
he
said
he
was
the
innocentest
best
old
soul
i
ever
see
but
it
war
surprising
because
he
war
only
just
a
farmer
he
was
a
preacher
too
and
had
a
little
log
church
down
back
of
the
plantation
which
he
built
it
himself
at
his
own
expense
for
a
church
and
schoolhouse
and
never
charged
nothing
for
his
preaching
and
it
was
worth
it
too
there
was
plenty
other
like
that
and
done
the
same
way
down
south
in
about
half
an
hour
tom
wagon
drove
up
to
the
front
stile
and
aunt
sally
she
see
it
through
the
window
because
it
was
only
about
fifty
yards
and
says
why
there
somebody
come
i
wonder
who
is
why
i
do
believe
a
stranger
jimmy
that
one
of
the
children
run
and
tell
lize
to
put
on
another
plate
for
dinner
everybody
made
a
rush
for
the
front
door
because
of
course
a
stranger
do
come
year
and
so
he
lays
over
the
for
interest
when
he
does
come
tom
was
over
the
stile
and
starting
for
the
house
the
wagon
was
spinning
up
the
road
for
the
village
and
we
was
all
bunched
in
the
front
door
tom
had
his
store
clothes
on
and
an
audience
and
that
was
always
nuts
for
tom
sawyer
in
them
circumstances
it
war
no
trouble
to
him
to
throw
in
an
amount
of
style
that
was
suitable
he
war
a
boy
to
meeky
along
up
that
yard
like
a
sheep
no
he
come
ca
and
important
like
the
ram
when
he
got
of
us
he
lifts
his
hat
ever
so
gracious
and
dainty
like
it
was
the
lid
of
a
box
that
had
butterflies
asleep
in
it
and
he
did
want
to
disturb
them
and
says
archibald
nichols
i
presume
no
my
boy
says
the
old
gentleman
i
sorry
to
say
your
driver
has
deceived
you
nichols
place
is
down
a
matter
of
three
mile
more
come
in
come
in
tom
he
took
a
look
back
over
his
shoulder
and
says
too
late
out
of
sight
yes

my
son
and
you
must
come
in
and
eat
your
dinner
with
us
and
then
we
hitch
up
and
take
you
down
to
nichols
oh
i
make
you
so
much
trouble
i
could
think
of
it
walk
i
do
mind
the
distance
but
we
wo
you
walk
it
would
be
southern
hospitality
to
do
it
come
right
in
oh
says
aunt
sally
it
ai
a
bit
of
trouble
to
us
not
a
bit
in
the
world
you
must
stay
it
a
long
dusty
three
mile
and
we
ca
let

and
besides
i
already

another
plate
when
i
see
you
coming
so
you
must
disappoint
us
come
right
in
and
make
yourself
at
home
so
tom
he
thanked
them
very
hearty
and
handsome
and
let
himself
be
persuaded
and
come
in
and
when
he
was
in
he
said
he
was
a
stranger
from
hicksville
ohio
and
his
name
was
william
thompson
and
he
made
another
bow
well
he
run
on
and
on
and
on
making
up
stuff
about
hicksville
and
everybody
in
it
he
could
invent
and
i
getting
a
little
nervious
and
wondering
how
this
was
going
to
help
me
out
of
my
scrape
and
at
last
still
talking
along
he
reached
over
and
kissed
aunt
sally
right
on
the
mouth
and
then
settled
back
again
in
his
chair
comfortable
and
was
going
on
talking
but
she
jumped
up
and
wiped
it
off
with
the
back
of
her
hand
and
says
you
owdacious
puppy
he
looked
kind
of
hurt
and
says
i
surprised
at
you

why

do
you
reckon

i
a
good
notion
to
take
and
say
what
do

by
kissing
me
he
looked
kind
of
humble
and
says
i
did
mean
nothing
i
did
mean
no
harm
i
i
thought
you
like
it
why
you
born
fool
she
took
up
the
and
it

like
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
keep
from
giving
him
a
crack
with
it
what

so
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
hold
in
and
her
eyes
snapped
and
her
fingers
worked
like
she
wanted
to
scratch
him
and
she
says
who
out
with
their
names
or
ther
be
an
idiot
short
he
got
up
and
looked
distressed
and
fumbled
his
hat
and
says

and
i
war
expecting
it
they
told
me
to
they
all
told
me
to
they
all
said

and
said
she
like
it
they

before

he
says
it
does
surprise
me
so
i
ca
make
it
out
somehow
they
said
you
would
and
i
thought
you
would
but
he
stopped
and
looked
around
slow
like
he
wished
he
could
run
across
a
friendly
eye
somewheres
and
fetched
up
on
the
old
gentleman
and
says
did
think
she
like
me
to
kiss
her
sir
why
no
i
i
well
no
i
i
did
then
he
looks
on
around
the
same
way
to
me
and
says
tom
did
think
aunt
sally
open
out
her
arms
and
say
sawyer
my
land
she
says
breaking
in
and
jumping
for
him
you
impudent
young
rascal
to
fool
a
body
so
and
was
going
to
hug
him
but
he
fended
her
off
and
says
no
not
till
you
asked
me
first
so
she
did
lose
no
time
but
asked
him
and
hugged
him
and
kissed
him
over
and
over
again
and
then
turned
him
over
to
the
old
man
and
he
took
what
was
left
and
after
they
got
a
little
quiet
again
she
says
why
dear
me
i
never
see
such
a
surprise
we
war
looking
for
at
all
but
only
tom
sis
never
wrote
to
me
about
anybody
coming
but
him
it
because
it
war
for
any
of
us
to
come
but
tom
he
says
but
i
begged
and
begged
and
at
the
last
minute
she
let
me
come
too
so
coming
down
the
river
me
and
tom
thought
it
would
be
a
surprise
for
him
to
come
here
to
the
house
first
and
for
me
to
by
and
by
tag
along
and
drop
in
and
let
on
to
be
a
stranger
but
it
was
a
mistake
aunt
sally
this
ai
no
healthy
place
for
a
stranger
to
come
no
not
impudent
whelps
sid
you
ought
to
had
your
jaws
boxed
i
hai
been
so
put
out
since
i
do
know
when
but
i
do
care
i
do
mind
the
terms
i
be
willing
to
stand
a
thousand
such
jokes
to
have
you
here
well
to
think
of
that
performance
i
do
deny
it
i
was
most
putrified
with
astonishment
when
you
give
me
that
smack
we
had
dinner
out
in
that
broad
open
passage
betwixt
the
house
and
the
kitchen
and
there
was
things
enough
on
that
table
for
seven
families
and
all
hot
too
none
of
your
flabby
tough
meat
laid
in
a
cupboard
in
a
damp
cellar
all
night
and
tastes
like
a
hunk
of
old
cold
cannibal
in
the
morning
uncle
silas
he
asked
a
pretty
long
blessing
over
it
but
it
was
worth
it
and
it
did
cool
it
a
bit
neither
the
way
i
seen
them
kind
of
interruptions
do
lots
of
times
there
was
a
considerable
good
deal
of
talk
all
the
afternoon
and
me
and
tom
was
on
the
lookout
all
the
time
but
it
war
no
use
they
did
happen
to
say
nothing
about
any
runaway
nigger
and
we
was
afraid
to
try
to
work
up
to
it
but
at
supper
at
night
one
of
the
little
boys
says
pa
may
tom
and
sid
and
me
go
to
the
show
no
says
the
old
man
i
reckon
there
ai
going
to
be
any
and
you
could
go
if
there
was
because
the
runaway
nigger
told
burton
and
me
all
about
that
scandalous
show
and
burton
said
he
would
tell
the
people
so
i
reckon
they
drove
the
owdacious
loafers
out
of
town
before
this
time
so
there
it
was
but
could
help
it
tom
and
me
was
to
sleep
in
the
same
room
and
bed
so
being
tired
we
bid
good
night
and
went
up
to
bed
right
after
supper
and
clumb
out
of
the
window
and
down
the
and
shoved
for
the
town
for
i
did
believe
anybody
was
going
to
give
the
king
and
the
duke
a
hint
and
so
if
i
hurry
up
and
give
them
one
they
get
into
trouble
sure
on
the
road
tom
he
told
me
all
about
how
it
was
reckoned
i
was
murdered
and
how
pap
disappeared
pretty
soon
and
did
come
back
no
more
and
what
a
stir
there
was
when
jim
run
away
and
i
told
tom
all
about
our
royal
nonesuch
rapscallions
and
as
much
of
the
raft
voyage
as
i
had
time
to
and
as
we
struck
into
the
town
and
up
through
the
middle
of
it
it
was
as
much
as
half
after
eight
then
here
comes
a
raging
rush
of
people
with
torches
and
an
awful
whooping
and
yelling
and
banging
tin
pans
and
blowing
horns
and
we
jumped
to
one
side
to
let
them
go
by
and
as
they
went
by
i
see
they
had
the
king
and
the
duke
astraddle
of
a
rail
that
is
i
knowed
it
the
king
and
the
duke
though
they
was
all
over
tar
and
feathers
and
look
like
nothing
in
the
world
that
was
human
just
looked
like
a
couple
of
monstrous
big
well
it
made
me
sick
to
see
it
and
i
was
sorry
for
them
poor
pitiful
rascals
it
seemed
like
i
could
ever
feel
any
hardness
against
them
any
more
in
the
world
it
was
a
dreadful
thing
to
see
human
beings
be
awful
cruel
to
one
another
we
see
we
was
too
late
could
do
no
good
we
asked
some
stragglers
about
it
and
they
said
everybody
went
to
the
show
looking
very
innocent
and
laid
low
and
kept
dark
till
the
poor
old
king
was
in
the
middle
of
his
cavortings
on
the
stage
then
somebody
give
a
signal
and
the
house
rose
up
and
went
for
them
so
we
poked
along
back
home
and
i
war
feeling
so
brash
as
i
was
before
but
kind
of
ornery
and
humble
and
to
blame
somehow
though
i
had
done
nothing
but
that
always
the
way
it
do
make
no
difference
whether
you
do
right
or
wrong
a
person
conscience
got
no
sense
and
just
goes
for
him
if
i
had
a
yaller
dog
that
did
know
no
more
than
a
person
conscience
does
i
would
pison
him
it
takes
up
more
room
than
all
the
rest
of
a
person
insides
and
yet
ai
no
good
nohow
tom
sawyer
he
says
the
same
chapter
xxxiv
we
stopped
talking
and
got
to
thinking
by
and
by
tom
says
looky
here
huck
what
fools
we
are
to
not
think
of
it
before
i
bet
i
know
where
jim
is
no
where
in
that
hut
down
by
the
why
looky
here
when
we
was
at
dinner
did
you
see
a
nigger
man
go
in
there
with
some
vittles
yes
what
did
you
think
the
vittles
was
for
for
a
dog
so
i
well
it
was
for
a
dog
why
because
part
of
it
was
watermelon
so
it
was
i
noticed
it
well
it
does
beat
all
that
i
never
thought
about
a
dog
not
eating
watermelon
it
shows
how
a
body
can
see
and
do
see
at
the
same
time
well
the
nigger
unlocked
the
padlock
when
he
went
in
and
he
locked
it
again
when
he
came
out
he
fetched
uncle
a
key
about
the
time
we
got
up
from
table
same
key
i
bet
watermelon
shows
man
lock
shows
prisoner
and
it
ai
likely
there
two
prisoners
on
such
a
little
plantation
and
where
the
people
all
so
kind
and
good
jim
the
prisoner
all
right
i
glad
we
found
it
out
detective
fashion
i
would
give
shucks
for
any
other
way
now
you
work
your
mind
and
study
out
a
plan
to
steal
jim
and
i
will
study
out
one
too
and
we
take
the
one
we
like
the
best
what
a
head
for
just
a
boy
to
have
if
i
had
tom
sawyer
head
i
would
trade
it
off
to
be
a
duke
nor
mate
of
a
steamboat
nor
clown
in
a
circus
nor
nothing
i
can
think
of
i
went
to
thinking
out
a
plan
but
only
just
to
be
doing
something
i
knowed
very
well
where
the
right
plan
was
going
to
come
from
pretty
soon
tom
says
ready
yes
i
says
all
right
bring
it
out
my
plan
is
this
i
says
we
can
easy
find
out
if
it
jim
in
there
then
get
up
my
canoe
night
and
fetch
my
raft
over
from
the
island
then
the
first
dark
night
that
comes
steal
the
key
out
of
the
old
man
britches
after
he
goes
to
bed
and
shove
off
down
the
river
on
the
raft
with
jim
hiding
daytimes
and
running
nights
the
way
me
and
jim
used
to
do
before
would
that
plan
work
why
it
would
work
like
rats
but
too
blame
simple
there
ai
nothing
it
what
the
good
of
a
plan
that
ai
no
more
trouble
than
that
it
as
mild
as
why
huck
it
would
make
no
more
talk
than
breaking
into
a
soap
factory
i
never
said
nothing
because
i
war
expecting
nothing
different
but
i
knowed
mighty
well
that
whenever
he
got
plan
ready
it
would
have
none
of
them
objections
to
it
and
it
did
he
told
me
what
it
was
and
i
see
in
a
minute
it
was
worth
fifteen
of
mine
for
style
and
would
make
jim
just
as
free
a
man
as
mine
would
and
maybe
get
us
all
killed
besides
so
i
was
satisfied
and
said
we
would
waltz
in
on
it
i
need
tell
what
it
was
here
because
i
knowed
it
would
stay
the
way
it
was
i
knowed
he
would
be
changing
it
around
every
which
way
as
we
went
along
and
heaving
in
new
bullinesses
wherever
he
got
a
chance
and
that
is
what
he
done
well
one
thing
was
dead
sure
and
that
was
that
tom
sawyer
was
in
earnest
and
was
actuly
going
to
help
steal
that
nigger
out
of
slavery
that
was
the
thing
that
was
too
many
for
me
here
was
a
boy
that
was
respectable
and
well
brung
up
and
had
a
character
to
lose
and
folks
at
home
that
had
characters
and
he
was
bright
and
not
and
knowing
and
not
ignorant
and
not
mean
but
kind
and
yet
here
he
was
without
any
more
pride
or
rightness
or
feeling
than
to
stoop
to
this
business
and
make
himself
a
shame
and
his
family
a
shame
before
everybody
i
understand
it
no
way
at
all
it
was
outrageous
and
i
knowed
i
ought
to
just
up
and
tell
him
so
and
so
be
his
true
friend
and
let
him
quit
the
thing
right
where
he
was
and
save
himself
and
i
start
to
tell
him
but
he
shut
me
up
and
says
do
you
reckon
i
know
what
i
about
do
i
generly
know
what
i
about
yes
did
i
i
was
going
to
help
steal
the
nigger
yes
well
then
that
all
he
said
and
that
all
i
said
it
war
no
use
to
say
any
more
because
when
he
said
he
do
a
thing
he
always
done
it
but
i
could
make
out
how
he
was
willing
to
go
into
this
thing
so
i
just
let
it
go
and
never
bothered
no
more
about
it
if
he
was
bound
to
have
it
so
i
could
help
it
when
we
got
home
the
house
was
all
dark
and
still
so
we
went
on
down
to
the
hut
by
the
for
to
examine
it
we
went
through
the
yard
so
as
to
see
what
the
hounds
would
do
they
knowed
us
and
make
no
more
noise
than
country
dogs
is
always
doing
when
anything
comes
by
in
the
night
when
we
got
to
the
cabin
we
took
a
look
at
the
front
and
the
two
sides
and
on
the
side
i
war
acquainted
with
which
was
the
north
side
we
found
a
square
up
tolerable
high
with
just
one
stout
board
nailed
across
it
i
says
here
the
ticket
this
hole
big
enough
for
jim
to
get
through
if
we
wrench
off
the
board
tom
says
it
as
simple
as
and
as
easy
as
playing
hooky
i
should
we
can
find
a
way
that
a
little
more
complicated
than
huck
finn
well
then
i
says
how
it
do
to
saw
him
out
the
way
i
done
before
i
was
murdered
that
time
that
more
he
says
it
real
mysterious
and
troublesome
and
good
he
says
but
i
bet
we
can
find
a
way
that
twice
as
long
there
ai
no
hurry
le
keep
on
looking
around
betwixt
the
hut
and
the
fence
on
the
back
side
was
a
that
joined
the
hut
at
the
eaves
and
was
made
out
of
plank
it
was
as
long
as
the
hut
but
narrow
only
about
six
foot
wide
the
door
to
it
was
at
the
south
end
and
was
padlocked
tom
he
went
to
the
and
searched
around
and
fetched
back
the
iron
thing
they
lift
the
lid
with
so
he
took
it
and
prized
out
one
of
the
staples
the
chain
fell
down
and
we
opened
the
door
and
went
in
and
shut
it
and
struck
a
match
and
see
the
shed
was
only
built
against
a
cabin
and
had
no
connection
with
it
and
there
war
no
floor
to
the
shed
nor
nothing
in
it
but
some
old
rusty
hoes
and
spades
and
picks
and
a
crippled
plow
the
match
went
out
and
so
did
we
and
shoved
in
the
staple
again
and
the
door
was
locked
as
good
as
ever
tom
was
joyful
he
says
now
we
all
right
we
him
out
it
take
about
a
week
then
we
started
for
the
house
and
i
went
in
the
back
door
you
only
have
to
pull
a
buckskin
they
do
fasten
the
doors
but
that
war
romantical
enough
for
tom
sawyer
no
way
would
do
him
but
he
must
climb
up
the
but
after
he
got
up
about
three
times
and
missed
fire
and
fell
every
time
and
the
last
time
most
busted
his
brains
out
he
thought
he
got
to
give
it
up
but
after
he
was
rested
he
allowed
he
would
give
her
one
more
turn
for
luck
and
this
time
he
made
the
trip
in
the
morning
we
was
up
at
break
of
day
and
down
to
the
nigger
cabins
to
pet
the
dogs
and
make
friends
with
the
nigger
that
fed
jim
if
it
jim
that
was
being
fed
the
niggers
was
just
getting
through
breakfast
and
starting
for
the
fields
and
jim
nigger
was
piling
up
a
tin
pan
with
bread
and
meat
and
things
and
whilst
the
others
was
leaving
the
key
come
from
the
house
this
nigger
had
a
face
and
his
wool
was
all
tied
up
in
little
bunches
with
thread
that
was
to
keep
witches
off
he
said
the
witches
was
pestering
him
awful
these
nights
and
making
him
see
all
kinds
of
strange
things
and
hear
all
kinds
of
strange
words
and
noises
and
he
did
believe
he
was
ever
witched
so
long
before
in
his
life
he
got
so
worked
up
and
got
to
running
on
so
about
his
troubles
he
forgot
all
about
what
he
been
to
do
so
tom
says
what
the
vittles
for
going
to
feed
the
dogs
the
nigger
kind
of
smiled
around
graduly
over
his
face
like
when
you
heave
a
brickbat
in
a
and
he
says
yes
mars
sid
dog
dog
too
does
you
want
to
go
en
look
at

i
hunched
tom
and
whispers
you
going
right

in
the
daybreak

plan

so
drat
him
we
went
along
but
i
did
like
it
much
when
we
got
in
we
could
hardly
see
anything
it
was
so
dark
but
jim
was
there
sure
enough
and
could
see
us
and
he
sings
out
why
en
good
ain
dat
misto
tom
i
just
knowed
how
it
would
be
i
just
expected
it
i
did

and
if

could

it
because
that
nigger
busted
in
and
says
why
de
gracious
sakes

he
know
you
genlmen
we
could
see
pretty
well
now
tom
he
looked
at
the
nigger
steady
and
kind
of
wondering
and
says

i
do
reckon
he
does
but
what

and
turns
to
me
perfectly
ca
and
says

of
course
there
war
nothing
to
be
said
but
the
one
thing
so
i
says
no
ai
heard
nobody
say
nothing
then
he
turns
to
jim
and
looks
him
over
like
he
never
see
him

and
says

so
tom
turns
to
the
nigger
which
was
looking
wild
and
distressed
and
says
kind
of
severe
what
do
you
reckon
the
matter
with
you
anyway
what
made
you
think

oh

he

dime
and
said
we
would
tell
nobody
and
told
him
to
buy
some
more
thread
to
tie
up
his
wool
with
and
then
looks
at
jim
and
says
i
wonder
if
uncle
silas
is
going
to
hang
this
nigger
if
i
was
to
catch
a
nigger
that
was
ungrateful
enough
to
run
away
i
would
give
him
up
i
hang
him
and
whilst
the
nigger
stepped
to
the
door
to
look
at
the
dime
and
bite
it
to
see
if
it
was
good
he
whispers
to
jim
and
says
do
ever
let
on
to
know
us
and
if
you
hear
any
digging
going
on
nights
it
us
we
going
to
set
you
free
jim
only
had
time
to
grab
us
by
the
hand
and
squeeze
it
then
the
nigger
come
back
and
we
said
we
come
again
some
time
if
the
nigger
wanted
us
to
and
he
said
he
would
more
particular
if
it
was
dark
because
the
witches
went
for
him
mostly
in
the
dark
and
it
was
good
to
have
folks
around
then
chapter
xxxv
it
would
be
most
an
hour
yet
till
breakfast
so
we
left
and
struck
down
into
the
woods
because
tom
said
we
got
to
have
light
to
see
how
to
dig
by
and
a
lantern
makes
too
much
and
might
get
us
into
trouble
what
we
must
have
was
a
lot
of
them
rotten
chunks
called
and
just
makes
a
soft
kind
of
a
glow
when
you
lay
them
in
a
dark
place
we
fetched
an
armful
and
hid
it
in
the
weeds
and
set
down
to
rest
and
tom
says
kind
of
dissatisfied
blame
it
this
whole
thing
is
just
as
easy
and
awkward
as
it
can
be
and
so
it
makes
it
so
rotten
difficult
to
get
up
a
difficult
plan
there
ai
no
watchman
to
be
drugged
now
there
to
be
a
watchman
there
ai
even
a
dog
to
give
a
to
and
there
jim
chained
by
one
leg
with
a
chain
to
the
leg
of
his
bed
why
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
lift
up
the
bedstead
and
slip
off
the
chain
and
uncle
silas
he
trusts
everybody
sends
the
key
to
the
nigger
and
do
send
nobody
to
watch
the
nigger
jim
could
got
out
of
that
before
this
only
there
would
be
no
use
trying
to
travel
with
a
chain
on
his
leg
why
drat
it
huck
it
the
stupidest
arrangement
i
ever
see
you
got
to
invent
the
difficulties
well
we
ca
help
it
we
got
to
do
the
best
we
can
with
the
materials
we
got
anyhow
there
one
thing
there
more
honor
in
getting
him
out
through
a
lot
of
difficulties
and
dangers
where
there
war
one
of
them
furnished
to
you
by
the
people
who
it
was
their
duty
to
furnish
them
and
you
had
to
contrive
them
all
out
of
your
own
head
now
look
at
just
that
one
thing
of
the
lantern
when
you
come
down
to
the
cold
facts
we
simply
got
to
that
a
lantern
resky
why
we
could
work
with
a
torchlight
procession
if
we
wanted
to
believe
now
whilst
i
think
of
it
we
got
to
hunt
up
something
to
make
a
saw
out
of
the
first
chance
we
get
what
do
we
want
of
a
saw
what
do
we
of
a
saw
hai
we
got
to
saw
the
leg
of
jim
bed
off
so
as
to
get
the
chain
loose
why
you
just
said
a
body
could
lift
up
the
bedstead
and
slip
the
chain
off
well
if
that
ai
just
like
you
huck
finn
you
get
up
the
ways
of
going
at
a
thing
why
hai
you
ever
read
any
books
at
all
baron
trenck
nor
casanova
nor
benvenuto
chelleeny
nor
henri
nor
none
of
them
heroes
who
ever
heard
of
getting
a
prisoner
loose
in
such
an
way
as
that
no
the
way
all
the
best
authorities
does
is
to
saw
the
in
two
and
leave
it
just
so
and
swallow
the
sawdust
so
it
ca
be
found
and
put
some
dirt
and
grease
around
the
sawed
place
so
the
very
keenest
seneskal
ca
see
no
sign
of
its
being
sawed
and
thinks
the
is
perfectly
sound
then
the
night
you
ready
fetch
the
leg
a
kick
down
she
goes
slip
off
your
chain
and
there
you
are
nothing
to
do
but
hitch
your
rope
ladder
to
the
battlements
shin
down
it
break
your
leg
in
the
moat
because
a
rope
ladder
is
nineteen
foot
too
short
you
know
and
there
your
horses
and
your
trusty
vassles
and
they
scoop
you
up
and
fling
you
across
a
saddle
and
away
you
go
to
your
native
langudoc
or
navarre
or
wherever
it
is
it
gaudy
huck
i
wish
there
was
a
moat
to
this
cabin
if
we
get
time
the
night
of
the
escape
we
dig
one
i
says
what
do
we
want
of
a
moat
when
we
going
to
snake
him
out
from
under
the
cabin
but
he
never
heard
me
he
had
forgot
me
and
everything
else
he
had
his
chin
in
his
hand
thinking
pretty
soon
he
sighs
and
shakes
his
head
then
sighs
again
and
says
no
it
would
do
there
ai
necessity
enough
for
it
for
what
i
says
why
to
saw
jim
leg
off
he
says
good
land
i
says
why
there
ai
necessity
for
it
and
what
would
you
want
to
saw
his
leg
off
for
anyway
well
some
of
the
best
authorities
has
done
it
they
could
get
the
chain
off
so
they
just
cut
their
hand
off
and
shoved
and
a
leg
would
be
better
still
but
we
got
to
let
that
go
there
ai
necessity
enough
in
this
case
and
besides
jim
a
nigger
and
understand
the
reasons
for
it
and
how
it
the
custom
in
europe
so
we
let
it
go
but
there
one
thing
he
can
have
a
rope
ladder
we
can
tear
up
our
sheets
and
make
him
a
rope
ladder
easy
enough
and
we
can
send
it
to
him
in
a
pie
it
mostly
done
that
way
and
i
et
worse
pies
why
tom
sawyer
how
you
talk
i
says
jim
ai
got
no
use
for
a
rope
ladder
he
got
use
for
it
how
talk
you
better
say
you
know
nothing
about
it
he
to
have
a
rope
ladder
they
all
do
what
in
the
nation
can
he
with
it
with
it
he
can
hide
it
in
his
bed
ca
he
that
what
they
all
do
and
got
to
too
huck
you
do
ever
seem
to
want
to
do
anything
that
regular
you
want
to
be
starting
something
fresh
all
the
time
he
do
nothing
with
it
ai
it
there
in
his
bed
for
a
clue
after
he
gone
and
do
you
reckon
want
clues
of
course
they
will
and
you
would
leave
them
any
that
would
be
a
it
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
well
i
says
if
it
in
the
regulations
and
he
got
to
have
it
all
right
let
him
have
it
because
i
do
wish
to
go
back
on
no
regulations
but
there
one
thing
tom
sawyer
if
we
go
to
tearing
up
our
sheets
to
make
jim
a
rope
ladder
we
going
to
get
into
trouble
with
aunt
sally
just
as
sure
as
you
born
now
the
way
i
look
at
it
a
ladder
do
cost
nothing
and
do
waste
nothing
and
is
just
as
good
to
load
up
a
pie
with
and
hide
in
a
straw
tick
as
any
rag
ladder
you
can
start
and
as
for
jim
he
ai
had
no
experience
and
so
he
do
care
what
kind
of
a
oh
shucks
huck
finn
if
i
was
as
ignorant
as
you
i
keep
still
that
what
i
do
who
ever
heard
of
a
state
prisoner
escaping
by
a
ladder
why
it
perfectly
ridiculous
well
all
right
tom
fix
it
your
own
way
but
if
you
take
my
advice
you
let
me
borrow
a
sheet
off
of
the
he
said
that
would
do
and
that
gave
him
another
idea
and
he
says
borrow
a
shirt
too
what
do
we
want
of
a
shirt
tom
want
it
for
jim
to
keep
a
journal
on
journal
your
granny
ca
write
he
write
he
can
make
marks
on
the
shirt
ca
he
if
we
make
him
a
pen
out
of
an
old
pewter
spoon
or
a
piece
of
an
old
iron
why
tom
we
can
pull
a
feather
out
of
a
goose
and
make
him
a
better
one
and
quicker
too
do
have
geese
running
around
the
to
pull
pens
out
of
you
muggins
they
make
their
pens
out
of
the
hardest
toughest
troublesomest
piece
of
old
brass
candlestick
or
something
like
that
they
can
get
their
hands
on
and
it
takes
them
weeks
and
weeks
and
months
and
months
to
file
it
out
too
because
they
got
to
do
it
by
rubbing
it
on
the
wall
would
use
a
if
they
had
it
it
ai
regular
well
then
what
we
make
him
the
ink
out
of
many
makes
it
out
of
and
tears
but
that
the
common
sort
and
women
the
best
authorities
uses
their
own
blood
jim
can
do
that
and
when
he
wants
to
send
any
little
common
ordinary
mysterious
message
to
let
the
world
know
where
he
captivated
he
can
write
it
on
the
bottom
of
a
tin
plate
with
a
fork
and
throw
it
out
of
the
window
the
iron
mask
always
done
that
and
it
a
blame
good
way
too
jim
ai
got
no
tin
plates
they
feed
him
in
a
pan
that
ai
nothing
we
can
get
him
some
ca
nobody
his
plates
that
ai
got
anything
to
with
it
huck
finn
all
got
to
do
is
to
write
on
the
plate
and
throw
it
out
you
do
to
be
able
to
read
it
why
half
the
time
you
ca
read
anything
a
prisoner
writes
on
a
tin
plate
or
anywhere
else
well
then
what
the
sense
in
wasting
the
plates
why
blame
it
all
it
ai
the
plates
but
it
plates
ai
it
well
it
is
what
does
the
care
whose
he
broke
off
there
because
we
heard
the
blowing
so
we
cleared
out
for
the
house
along
during
the
morning
i
borrowed
a
sheet
and
a
white
shirt
off
of
the
and
i
found
an
old
sack
and
put
them
in
it
and
we
went
down
and
got
the
and
put
that
in
too
i
called
it
borrowing
because
that
was
what
pap
always
called
it
but
tom
said
it
war
borrowing
it
was
stealing
he
said
we
was
representing
prisoners
and
prisoners
do
care
how
they
get
a
thing
so
they
get
it
and
nobody
do
blame
them
for
it
either
it
ai
no
crime
in
a
prisoner
to
steal
the
thing
he
needs
to
get
away
with
tom
said
his
right
and
so
as
long
as
we
was
representing
a
prisoner
we
had
a
perfect
right
to
steal
anything
on
this
place
we
had
the
least
use
for
to
get
ourselves
out
of
prison
with
he
said
if
we
war
prisoners
it
would
be
a
very
different
thing
and
nobody
but
a
mean
ornery
person
would
steal
when
he
war
a
prisoner
so
we
allowed
we
would
steal
everything
there
was
that
come
handy
and
yet
he
made
a
mighty
fuss
one
day
after
that
when
i
stole
a
watermelon
out
of
the
nigger
patch
and
eat
it
and
he
made
me
go
and
give
the
niggers
a
dime
without
telling
them
what
it
was
for
tom
said
that
what
he
meant
was
we
could
steal
anything
we
well
i
says
i
needed
the
watermelon
but
he
said
i
did
need
it
to
get
out
of
prison
with
there
where
the
difference
was
he
said
if
i
wanted
it
to
hide
a
knife
in
and
smuggle
it
to
jim
to
kill
the
seneskal
with
it
would
been
all
right
so
i
let
it
go
at
that
though
i
could
see
no
advantage
in
my
representing
a
prisoner
if
i
got
to
set
down
and
chaw
over
a
lot
of
distinctions
like
that
every
time
i
see
a
chance
to
hog
a
watermelon
well
as
i
was
saying
we
waited
that
morning
till
everybody
was
settled
down
to
business
and
nobody
in
sight
around
the
yard
then
tom
he
carried
the
sack
into
the
whilst
i
stood
off
a
piece
to
keep
watch
by
and
by
he
come
out
and
we
went
and
set
down
on
the
woodpile
to
talk
he
says
everything
all
right
now
except
tools
and
that
easy
fixed
tools
i
says
yes
tools
for
what
why
to
dig
with
we
ai
to
him
out
are
we
ai
them
old
crippled
picks
and
things
in
there
good
enough
to
dig
a
nigger
out
with
i
says
he
turns
on
me
looking
pitying
enough
to
make
a
body
cry
and
says
huck
finn
did
you
hear
of
a
prisoner
having
picks
and
shovels
and
all
the
modern
conveniences
in
his
wardrobe
to
dig
himself
out
with
now
i
want
to
ask
you
if
you
got
any
reasonableness
in
you
at
all
what
kind
of
a
show
would
give
him
to
be
a
hero
why
they
might
as
well
lend
him
the
key
and
done
with
it
picks
and
shovels
why
they
would
furnish
to
a
king
well
then
i
says
if
we
do
want
the
picks
and
shovels
what
do
we
want
a
couple
of
to
dig
the
foundations
out
from
under
that
cabin
with
yes
confound
it
it
foolish
tom
it
do
make
no
difference
how
foolish
it
is
it
the
way
and
it
the
regular
way
and
there
ai
no
way
that
ever
i
heard
of
and
i
read
all
the
books
that
gives
any
information
about
these
things
they
always
dig
out
with
a
and
not
through
dirt
mind
you
generly
it
through
solid
rock
and
it
takes
them
weeks
and
weeks
and
weeks
and
for
ever
and
ever
why
look
at
one
of
them
prisoners
in
the
bottom
dungeon
of
the
castle
deef
in
the
harbor
of
marseilles
that
dug
himself
out
that
way
how
long
was
at
it
you
reckon
i
do
know
well
guess
i
do
know
a
month
and
a
half
and
he
come
out
in
china
the
kind
i
wish
the
bottom
of
fortress
was
solid
rock
do
know
nobody
in
china
what
got
to
do
with
it
neither
did
that
other
fellow
but
you
always
off
on
a
side
issue
why
ca
you
stick
to
the
main
point
all
right
i
do
care
where
he
comes
out
so
he
out
and
jim
do
either
i
reckon
but
there
one
thing
anyway
jim
too
old
to
be
dug
out
with
a
he
wo
last
yes
he
will
too
you
do
reckon
it
going
to
take
years
to
dig
out
through
a
foundation
do
you
how
long
will
it
take
tom
well
we
ca
resk
being
as
long
as
we
ought
to
because
it
take
very
long
for
uncle
silas
to
hear
from
down
there
by
new
orleans
he
hear
jim
ai
from
there
then
his
next
move
will
be
to
advertise
jim
or
something
like
that
so
we
ca
resk
being
as
long
digging
him
out
as
we
ought
to
by
rights
i
reckon
we
ought
to
be
a
couple
of
years
but
we
ca
things
being
so
uncertain
what
i
recommend
is
this
that
we
really
dig
right
in
as
quick
as
we
can
and
after
that
we
can
to
ourselves
that
we
was
at
it
years
then
we
can
snatch
him
out
and
rush
him
away
the
first
time
there
an
alarm
yes
i
reckon
that
be
the
best
way
now
there
in
that
i
says
letting
on
do
cost
nothing
letting
on
ai
no
trouble
and
if
it
any
object
i
mind
letting
on
we
was
at
it
a
hundred
and
fifty
year
it
strain
me
none
after
i
got
my
hand
in
so
i
mosey
along
now
and
smouch
a
couple
of
smouch
three
he
says
we
want
one
to
make
a
saw
out
of
tom
if
it
ai
unregular
and
irreligious
to
sejest
it
i
says
there
an
old
rusty
around
yonder
sticking
under
the
behind
the
smokehouse
he
looked
kind
of
weary
and
and
says
it
ai
no
use
to
try
to
learn
you
nothing
huck
run
along
and
smouch
the
knives
three
of
them
so
i
done
it
chapter
xxxvi
as
soon
as
we
reckoned
everybody
was
asleep
that
night
we
went
down
the
and
shut
ourselves
up
in
the
and
got
out
our
pile
of
and
went
to
work
we
cleared
everything
out
of
the
way
about
four
or
five
foot
along
the
middle
of
the
bottom
log
tom
said
we
was
right
behind
jim
bed
now
and
we
dig
in
under
it
and
when
we
got
through
there
could
nobody
in
the
cabin
ever
know
there
was
any
hole
there
because
jim
counterpin
hung
down
most
to
the
ground
and
you
have
to
raise
it
up
and
look
under
to
see
the
hole
so
we
dug
and
dug
with
the
till
most
midnight
and
then
we
was
and
our
hands
was
blistered
and
yet
you
could
see
we
done
anything
hardly
at
last
i
says
this
ai
no
job
this
is
a
job
tom
sawyer
he
never
said
nothing
but
he
sighed
and
pretty
soon
he
stopped
digging
and
then
for
a
good
little
while
i
knowed
that
he
was
thinking
then
he
says
it
ai
no
use
huck
it
ai
to
work
if
we
was
prisoners
it
would
because
then
we
have
as
many
years
as
we
wanted
and
no
hurry
and
we
would
get
but
a
few
minutes
to
dig
every
day
while
they
was
changing
watches
and
so
our
hands
would
get
blistered
and
we
could
keep
it
up
right
along
year
in
and
year
out
and
do
it
right
and
the
way
it
ought
to
be
done
but
ca
fool
along
we
got
to
rush
we
ai
got
no
time
to
spare
if
we
was
to
put
in
another
night
this
way
we
have
to
knock
off
for
a
week
to
let
our
hands
get
well
could
touch
a
with
them
sooner
well
then
what
we
going
to
do
tom
i
tell
you
it
ai
right
and
it
ai
moral
and
i
like
it
to
get
out
but
there
ai
only
just
the
one
way
we
got
to
dig
him
out
with
the
picks
and
it
you
i
says
your
head
gets
leveler
and
leveler
all
the
time
tom
sawyer
i
says
picks
is
the
thing
moral
or
no
moral
and
as
for
me
i
do
care
shucks
for
the
morality
of
it
nohow
when
i
start
in
to
steal
a
nigger
or
a
watermelon
or
a
book
i
ai
no
ways
particular
how
it
done
so
done
what
i
want
is
my
nigger
or
what
i
want
is
my
watermelon
or
what
i
want
is
my
book
and
if
a
pick
the
handiest
thing
that
the
thing
i
to
dig
that
nigger
or
that
watermelon
or
that
book
out
with
and
i
do
give
a
dead
rat
what
the
authorities
thinks
about
it
nuther
well
he
says
there
excuse
for
picks
and
letting
on
in
a
case
like
this
if
it
war
so
i
would
approve
of
it
nor
i
stand
by
and
see
the
rules
broke
because
right
is
right
and
wrong
is
wrong
and
a
body
ai
got
no
business
doing
wrong
when
he
ignorant
and
knows
better
it
might
answer
for
to
dig
jim
out
with
a
pick
any
letting
on
because
you
do
know
no
better
but
it
would
for
me
because
i
do
know
better
gim
me
a
he
had
his
own
by
him
but
i
handed
him
mine
he
flung
it
down
and
says
gim
me
a
i
did
know
just
what
to
do
but
then
i
thought
i
scratched
around
amongst
the
old
tools
and
got
a
pickax
and
give
it
to
him
and
he
took
it
and
went
to
work
and
never
said
a
word
he
was
always
just
that
particular
full
of
principle
so
then
i
got
a
shovel
and
then
we
picked
and
shoveled
turn
about
and
made
the
fur
fly
we
stuck
to
it
about
a
half
an
hour
which
was
as
long
as
we
could
stand
up
but
we
had
a
good
deal
of
a
hole
to
show
for
it
when
i
got
i
looked
out
at
the
window
and
see
tom
doing
his
level
best
with
the
but
he
could
come
it
his
hands
was
so
sore
at
last
he
says
it
ai
no
use
it
ca
be
done
what
you
reckon
i
better
do
you
think
of
no
way
yes
i
says
but
i
reckon
it
ai
regular
come
up
the
stairs
and
let
on
it
a
so
he
done
it
next
day
tom
stole
a
pewter
spoon
and
a
brass
candlestick
in
the
house
for
to
make
some
pens
for
jim
out
of
and
six
tallow
candles
and
i
hung
around
the
nigger
cabins
and
laid
for
a
chance
and
stole
three
tin
plates
tom
says
it
was
enough
but
i
said
nobody
would
ever
see
the
plates
that
jim
throwed
out
because
they
fall
in
the
and
jimpson
weeds
under
the
then
we
could
tote
them
back
and
he
could
use
them
over
again
so
tom
was
satisfied
then
he
says
now
the
thing
to
study
out
is
how
to
get
the
things
to
jim
take
them
in
through
the
hole
i
says
when
we
get
it
done
he
only
just
looked
scornful
and
said
something
about
nobody
ever
heard
of
such
an
idiotic
idea
and
then
he
went
to
studying
by
and
by
he
said
he
had
ciphered
out
two
or
three
ways
but
there
war
no
need
to
decide
on
any
of
them
yet
said
we
got
to
post
jim
first
that
night
we
went
down
the
a
little
after
ten
and
took
one
of
the
candles
along
and
listened
under
the
and
heard
jim
snoring
so
we
pitched
it
in
and
it
did
wake
him
then
we
whirled
in
with
the
pick
and
shovel
and
in
about
two
hours
and
a
half
the
job
was
done
we
crept
in
under
jim
bed
and
into
the
cabin
and
pawed
around
and
found
the
candle
and
lit
it
and
stood
over
jim
awhile
and
found
him
looking
hearty
and
healthy
and
then
we
woke
him
up
gentle
and
gradual
he
was
so
glad
to
see
us
he
most
cried
and
called
us
honey
and
all
the
pet
names
he
could
think
of
and
was
for
having
us
hunt
up
a
to
cut
the
chain
off
of
his
leg
with
right
away
and
clearing
out
without
losing
any
time
but
tom
he
showed
him
how
unregular
it
would
be
and
set
down
and
told
him
all
about
our
plans
and
how
we
could
alter
them
in
a
minute
any
time
there
was
an
alarm
and
not
to
be
the
least
afraid
because
we
would
see
he
got
away
so
jim
he
said
it
was
all
right
and
we
set
there
and
talked
over
old
times
awhile
and
then
tom
asked
a
lot
of
questions
and
when
jim
told
him
uncle
silas
come
in
every
day
or
two
to
pray
with
him
and
aunt
sally
come
in
to
see
if
he
was
comfortable
and
had
plenty
to
eat
and
both
of
them
was
kind
as
they
could
be
tom
says
i
know
how
to
fix
it
we
send
you
some
things
by
them
i
said
do
do
nothing
of
the
kind
it
one
of
the
most
jackass
ideas
i
ever
struck
but
he
never
paid
no
attention
to
me
went
right
on
it
was
his
way
when
he
got
his
plans
set
so
he
told
jim
how
we
have
to
smuggle
in
the
pie
and
other
large
things
by
nat
the
nigger
that
fed
him
and
he
must
be
on
the
lookout
and
not
be
surprised
and
not
let
nat
see
him
open
them
and
we
would
put
small
things
in
uncle
coat
pockets
and
he
must
steal
them
out
and
we
would
tie
things
to
aunt
or
put
them
in
her
apron
pocket
if
we
got
a
chance
and
told
him
what
they
would
be
and
what
they
was
for
and
told
him
how
to
keep
a
journal
on
the
shirt
with
his
blood
and
all
that
he
told
him
everything
jim
he
could
see
no
sense
in
the
most
of
it
but
he
allowed
we
was
white
folks
and
knowed
better
than
him
so
he
was
satisfied
and
said
he
would
do
it
all
just
as
tom
said
jim
had
plenty
pipes
and
tobacco
so
we
had
a
right
down
good
sociable
time
then
we
crawled
out
through
the
hole
and
so
home
to
bed
with
hands
that
looked
like
they
been
chawed
tom
was
in
high
spirits
he
said
it
was
the
best
fun
he
ever
had
in
his
life
and
the
most
intellectural
and
said
if
he
only
could
see
his
way
to
it
we
would
keep
it
up
all
the
rest
of
our
lives
and
leave
jim
to
our
children
to
get
out
for
he
believed
jim
would
come
to
like
it
better
and
better
the
more
he
got
used
to
it
he
said
that
in
that
way
it
could
be
strung
out
to
as
much
as
eighty
year
and
would
be
the
best
time
on
record
and
he
said
it
would
make
us
all
celebrated
that
had
a
hand
in
it
in
the
morning
we
went
out
to
the
woodpile
and
chopped
up
the
brass
candlestick
into
handy
sizes
and
tom
put
them
and
the
pewter
spoon
in
his
pocket
then
we
went
to
the
nigger
cabins
and
while
i
got
notice
off
tom
shoved
a
piece
of
candlestick
into
the
middle
of
a
that
was
in
jim
pan
and
we
went
along
with
nat
to
see
how
it
would
work
and
it
just
worked
noble
when
jim
bit
into
it
it
most
mashed
all
his
teeth
out
and
there
war
ever
anything
could
worked
better
tom
said
so
himself
jim
he
never
let
on
but
what
it
was
only
just
a
piece
of
rock
or
something
like
that
that
always
getting
into
bread
you
know
but
after
that
he
never
bit
into
nothing
but
what
he
jabbed
his
fork
into
it
in
three
or
four
places
first
and
whilst
we
was
there
in
the
dimmish
light
here
comes
a
couple
of
the
hounds
bulging
in
from
under
jim
bed
and
they
kept
on
piling
in
till
there
was
eleven
of
them
and
there
war
hardly
room
in
there
to
get
your
breath
by
jings
we
forgot
to
fasten
that
door
the
nigger
nat
he
only
just
hollered
witches
once
and
keeled
over
onto
the
floor
amongst
the
dogs
and
begun
to
groan
like
he
was
dying
tom
jerked
the
door
open
and
flung
out
a
slab
of
meat
and
the
dogs
went
for
it
and
in
two
seconds
he
was
out
himself
and
back
again
and
shut
the
door
and
i
knowed
he
fixed
the
other
door
too
then
he
went
to
work
on
the
nigger
coaxing
him
and
petting
him
and
asking
him
if
he
been
imagining
he
saw
something
again
he
raised
up
and
blinked
his
eyes
around
and

chapter
xxxvii
was
all
fixed
so
then
we
went
away
and
went
to
the
in
the
back
yard
where
they
keep
the
old
boots
and
rags
and
pieces
of
bottles
and
tin
things
and
all
such
truck
and
scratched
around
and
found
an
old
tin
washpan
and
stopped
up
the
holes
as
well
as
we
could
to
bake
the
pie
in
and
took
it
down
cellar
and
stole
it
full
of
flour
and
started
for
breakfast
and
found
a
couple
of
that
tom
said
would
be
handy
for
a
prisoner
to
scrabble
his
name
and
sorrows
on
the
dungeon
walls
with
and
dropped
one
of
them
in
aunt
sally
apron
pocket
which
was
hanging
on
a
chair
and
we
stuck
in
the
band
of
uncle
silas
hat
which
was
on
the
bureau
because
we
heard
the
children
say
their
pa
and
ma
was
going
to
the
runaway
nigger
house
this
morning
and
then
went
to
breakfast
and
tom
dropped
the
pewter
spoon
in
uncle
silas
coat
pocket
and
aunt
sally
was
come
yet
so
we
had
to
wait
a
little
while
and
when
she
come
she
was
hot
and
red
and
cross
and
could
hardly
wait
for
the
blessing
and
then
she
went
to
sluicing
out
coffee
with
one
hand
and
cracking
the
handiest
child
head
with
her
thimble
with
the
other
and
says
i
hunted
high
and
i
hunted
low
and
it
does
beat
all
what
become
of
your
other
shirt
my
heart
fell
down
amongst
my
lungs
and
livers
and
things
and
a
hard
piece
of
started
down
my
throat
after
it
and
got
met
on
the
road
with
a
cough
and
was
shot
across
the
table
and
took
one
of
the
children
in
the
eye
and
curled
him
up
like
a
and
let
a
cry
out
of
him
the
size
of
a
and
tom
he
turned
kinder
blue
around
the
gills
and
it
all
amounted
to
a
considerable
state
of
things
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
minute
or
as
much
as
that
and
i
would
sold
out
for
half
price
if
there
was
a
bidder
but
after
that
we
was
all
right
again
it
was
the
sudden
surprise
of
it
that
knocked
us
so
kind
of
cold
uncle
silas
he
says
it
most
uncommon
curious
i
ca
understand
it
i
know
perfectly
well
i
took
it
because
because
you
hai
got
but
one
just
at
the
man
i
know
you
took
it
off
and
know
it
by
a
better
way
than
your
memory
too
because
it
was
on
the
yesterday
i
see
it
there
myself
but
it
gone
that
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
and
you
just
have
to
change
to
a
red
one
till
i
can
get
time
to
make
a
new
one
and
it
be
the
third
i
made
in
two
years
it
just
keeps
a
body
on
the
jump
to
keep
you
in
shirts
and
whatever
you
do
manage
to
with
all
is
i
can
make
out
a
body
think
you
learn
to
take
some
sort
of
care
of
at
your
time
of
life
i
know
it
sally
and
i
do
try
all
i
can
but
it
ought
to
be
altogether
my
fault
because
you
know
i
do
see
them
nor
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
except
when
they
on
me
and
i
do
believe
i
ever
lost
one
of
them
of
me
well
it
ai
fault
if
you
have
silas
you
done
it
if
you
could
i
reckon
and
the
shirt
ai
all
that
gone
nuther
ther
a
spoon
gone
and
ai
all
there
was
ten
and
now
ther
only
nine
the
calf
got
the
shirt
i
reckon
but
the
calf
never
took
the
spoon
certain
why
what
else
is
gone
sally
ther
six
gone
that
what
the
rats
could
got
the
candles
and
i
reckon
they
did
i
wonder
they
do
walk
off
with
the
whole
place
the
way
you
always
going
to
stop
their
holes
and
do
it
and
if
they
war
fools
they
sleep
in
your
hair
silas
never
find
it
out
but
you
ca
lay
the
on
the
rats
and
that
i
well
sally
i
in
fault
and
i
acknowledge
it
i
been
remiss
but
i
wo
let
go
by
without
stopping
up
them
holes
oh
i
would
hurry
next
year
do
matilda
angelina
araminta
whack
comes
the
thimble
and
the
child
snatches
her
claws
out
of
the
without
fooling
around
any
just
then
the
nigger
woman
steps
onto
the
passage
and
says
missus
dey
a
sheet
gone
a
gone
well
for
the
land
sake
i
stop
up
them
holes
says
uncle
silas
looking
sorrowful
oh
shet
up
the
rats
took
the
it
gone
lize
clah
to
goodness
i
hai
no
notion
miss
sally
she
wuz
on
de
yistiddy
but
she
done
gone
she
ain
dah
no
mo
now
i
reckon
the
world
coming
to
an
end
i
see
the
beat
of
it
in
all
my
born
days
a
shirt
and
a
sheet
and
a
spoon
and
six
can
missus
comes
a
young
yaller
wench
dey
a
brass
cannelstick
cler
out
from
here
you
hussy
er
i
take
a
skillet
to
ye
well
she
was
just
i
begun
to
lay
for
a
chance
i
reckoned
i
would
sneak
out
and
go
for
the
woods
till
the
weather
moderated
she
kept
right
along
running
her
insurrection
all
by
herself
and
everybody
else
mighty
meek
and
quiet
and
at
last
uncle
silas
looking
kind
of
foolish
fishes
up
that
spoon
out
of
his
pocket
she
stopped
with
her
mouth
open
and
her
hands
up
and
as
for
me
i
wished
i
was
in
jeruslem
or
somewheres
but
not
long
because
she
says
it
as
i
expected
so
you
had
it
in
your
pocket
all
the
time
and
like
as
not
you
got
the
other
things
there
too
how
it
get
there
i
reely
do
know
sally
he
says
kind
of
apologizing
or
you
know
i
would
tell
i
was
over
my
text
in
acts
seventeen
before
breakfast
and
i
reckon
i
put
it
in
there
not
noticing
meaning
to
put
my
testament
in
and
it
must
be
so
because
my
testament
ai
in
but
i
go
and
see
and
if
the
testament
is
where
i
had
it
i
know
i
did
put
it
in
and
that
will
show
that
i
laid
the
testament
down
and
took
up
the
spoon
and
oh
for
the
land
sake
give
a
body
a
rest
go
now
the
whole
kit
and
biling
of
ye
and
do
come
nigh
me
again
till
i
got
back
my
peace
of
mind
i
heard
her
if
she
said
it
to
herself
let
alone
speaking
it
out
and
i
got
up
and
obeyed
her
if
i
been
dead
as
we
was
passing
through
the
the
old
man
he
took
up
his
hat
and
the
fell
out
on
the
floor
and
he
just
merely
picked
it
up
and
laid
it
on
the
and
never
said
nothing
and
went
out
tom
see
him
do
it
and
remembered
about
the
spoon
and
says
well
it
ai
no
use
to
send
things
by
no
more
he
reliable
then
he
says
but
he
done
us
a
good
turn
with
the
spoon
anyway
without
knowing
it
and
so
we
go
and
do
him
one
without
knowing
it
stop
up
his
there
was
a
noble
good
lot
of
them
down
cellar
and
it
took
us
a
whole
hour
but
we
done
the
job
tight
and
good
and
shipshape
then
we
heard
steps
on
the
stairs
and
blowed
out
our
light
and
hid
and
here
comes
the
old
man
with
a
candle
in
one
hand
and
a
bundle
of
stuff
in
looking
as
as
year
before
last
he
went
around
first
to
one
and
then
another
till
been
to
them
all
then
he
stood
about
five
minutes
picking
off
of
his
candle
and
thinking
then
he
turns
off
slow
and
dreamy
towards
the
stairs
saying
well
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
remember
when
i
done
it
i
could
show
her
now
that
i
war
to
blame
on
account
of
the
rats
but
never
mind
let
it
go
i
reckon
it
would
do
no
good
and
so
he
went
on
and
then
we
left
he
was
a
mighty
nice
old
man
and
always
is
tom
was
a
good
deal
bothered
about
what
to
do
for
a
spoon
but
he
said
we
got
to
have
it
so
he
took
a
think
when
he
had
ciphered
it
out
he
told
me
how
we
was
to
do
then
we
went
and
waited
around
the
till
we
see
aunt
sally
coming
and
then
tom
went
to
counting
the
spoons
and
laying
them
out
to
one
side
and
i
slid
one
of
them
up
my
sleeve
and
tom
says
why
aunt
sally
there
ai
but
nine
spoons
she
says
go
to
your
play
and
do
bother
me
i
know
better
i
counted
myself
well
i
counted
them
twice
aunty
and
ca
make
but
nine
she
looked
out
of
all
patience
but
of
course
she
come
to
count
anybody
would
i
declare
to
gracious
ther
but
nine
she
says
why
what
in
the
world
plague
the
things
i
count
again
so
i
slipped
back
the
one
i
had
and
when
she
got
done
counting
she
says
hang
the
troublesome
rubbage
ther
now
and
she
looked
huffy
and
bothered
both
but
tom
says
why
aunty
i
do
think
there
ten
you
numskull
did
you
see
me
i
know
but
well
i
count
again
so
i
smouched
one
and
they
come
out
nine
same
as
the
other
time
well
she
in
a
tearing
way
just
all
over
she
was
so
mad
but
she
counted
and
counted
till
she
got
that
addled
start
to
count
in
the
basket
for
a
spoon
sometimes
and
so
three
times
they
come
out
right
and
three
times
they
come
out
wrong
then
she
grabbed
up
the
basket
and
slammed
it
across
the
house
and
knocked
the
cat
and
she
said
cler
out
and
let
her
have
some
peace
and
if
we
come
bothering
around
her
again
betwixt
that
and
dinner
she
skin
us
so
we
had
the
odd
spoon
and
dropped
it
in
her
apron
pocket
whilst
she
was
us
our
sailing
orders
and
jim
got
it
all
right
along
with
her
before
noon
we
was
very
well
satisfied
with
this
business
and
tom
allowed
it
was
worth
twice
the
trouble
it
took
because
he
said
she
could
ever
count
them
spoons
twice
alike
again
to
save
her
life
and
believe
she
counted
them
right
if
she
and
said
that
after
she
about
counted
her
head
off
for
the
next
three
days
he
judged
she
give
it
up
and
offer
to
kill
anybody
that
wanted
her
to
ever
count
them
any
more
so
we
put
the
sheet
back
on
the
line
that
night
and
stole
one
out
of
her
closet
and
kept
on
putting
it
back
and
stealing
it
again
for
a
couple
of
days
till
she
did
know
how
many
sheets
she
had
any
more
and
she
did
and
war
to
bullyrag
the
rest
of
her
soul
out
about
it
and
would
count
them
again
not
to
save
her
life
she
druther
die
first
so
we
was
all
right
now
as
to
the
shirt
and
the
sheet
and
the
spoon
and
the
candles
by
the
help
of
the
calf
and
the
rats
and
the
counting
and
as
to
the
candlestick
it
war
no
consequence
it
would
blow
over
by
and
by
but
that
pie
was
a
job
we
had
no
end
of
trouble
with
that
pie
we
fixed
it
up
away
down
in
the
woods
and
cooked
it
there
and
we
got
it
done
at
last
and
very
satisfactory
too
but
not
all
in
one
day
and
we
had
to
use
up
three
full
of
flour
before
we
got
through
and
we
got
burnt
pretty
much
all
over
in
places
and
eyes
put
out
with
the
smoke
because
you
see
we
did
want
nothing
but
a
crust
and
we
could
prop
it
up
right
and
she
would
always
cave
in
but
of
course
we
thought
of
the
right
way
at
last
which
was
to
cook
the
ladder
too
in
the
pie
so
then
we
laid
in
with
jim
the
second
night
and
tore
up
the
sheet
all
in
little
strings
and
twisted
them
together
and
long
before
daylight
we
had
a
lovely
rope
that
you
could
hung
a
person
with
we
let
on
it
took
nine
months
to
make
it
and
in
the
forenoon
we
took
it
down
to
the
woods
but
it
would
go
into
the
pie
being
made
of
a
whole
sheet
that
way
there
was
rope
enough
for
forty
pies
if
we
wanted
them
and
plenty
left
over
for
soup
or
sausage
or
anything
you
choose
we
could
had
a
whole
dinner
but
we
did
need
it
all
we
needed
was
just
enough
for
the
pie
and
so
we
throwed
the
rest
away
we
did
cook
none
of
the
pies
in
the
washpan
afraid
the
solder
would
melt
but
uncle
silas
he
had
a
noble
brass
which
he
thought
considerable
of
because
it
belonged
to
one
of
his
ancesters
with
a
long
wooden
handle
that
come
over
from
england
with
william
the
conqueror
in
the
or
one
of
them
early
ships
and
was
hid
away
up
garret
with
a
lot
of
other
old
pots
and
things
that
was
valuable
not
on
account
of
being
any
account
because
they
war
but
on
account
of
them
being
relicts
you
know
and
we
snaked
her
out
private
and
took
her
down
there
but
she
failed
on
the
first
pies
because
we
did
know
how
but
she
come
up
smiling
on
the
last
one
we
took
and
lined
her
with
dough
and
set
her
in
the
coals
and
loaded
her
up
with
rag
rope
and
put
on
a
dough
roof
and
shut
down
the
lid
and
put
hot
embers
on
top
and
stood
off
five
foot
with
the
long
handle
cool
and
comfortable
and
in
fifteen
minutes
she
turned
out
a
pie
that
was
a
satisfaction
to
look
at
but
the
person
that
et
it
would
want
to
fetch
a
couple
of
kags
of
toothpicks
along
for
if
that
rope
ladder
would
cramp
him
down
to
business
i
do
know
nothing
what
i
talking
about
and
lay
him
in
enough
to
last
him
till
next
time
too
nat
did
look
when
we
put
the
witch
pie
in
jim
pan
and
we
put
the
three
tin
plates
in
the
bottom
of
the
pan
under
the
vittles
and
so
jim
got
everything
all
right
and
as
soon
as
he
was
by
himself
he
busted
into
the
pie
and
hid
the
rope
ladder
inside
of
his
straw
tick
and
scratched
some
marks
on
a
tin
plate
and
throwed
it
out
of
the
chapter
xxxviii
making
them
pens
was
a
distressid
tough
job
and
so
was
the
saw
and
jim
allowed
the
inscription
was
going
to
be
the
toughest
of
all
that
the
one
which
the
prisoner
has
to
scrabble
on
the
wall
but
he
had
to
have
it
tom
said
he
to
there
war
no
case
of
a
state
prisoner
not
scrabbling
his
inscription
to
leave
behind
and
his
coat
of
arms
look
at
lady
jane
grey
he
says
look
at
gilford
dudley
look
at
old
northumberland
why
huck
it
considerble
trouble
what
you
going
to
do
how
you
going
to
get
around
it
to
do
his
inscription
and
coat
of
arms
they
all
do
jim
says
why
mars
tom
i
hai
got
no
coat
o
arm
i
hai
got
nuffn
but
dish
yer
ole
shirt
en
you
knows
i
got
to
keep
de
journal
on
dat
oh
you
do
understand
jim
a
coat
of
arms
is
very
different
well
i
says
jim
right
anyway
when
he
says
he
ai
got
no
coat
of
arms
because
he
hai
i
reckon
i
knowed
that
tom
says
but
you
bet
he
have
one
before
he
goes
out
of
this
because
he
going
out
and
there
going
to
be
no
flaws
in
his
record
so
whilst
me
and
jim
filed
away
at
the
pens
on
a
brickbat
apiece
jim
out
of
the
brass
and
i
making
mine
out
of
the
spoon
tom
set
to
work
to
think
out
the
coat
of
arms
by
and
by
he
said
struck
so
many
good
ones
he
did
hardly
know
which
to
take
but
there
was
one
which
he
reckoned
he
decide
on
he
says
on
the
scutcheon
we
have
a
bend
in
the
dexter
base
a
saltire
in
the
fess
with
a
dog
couchant
for
common
charge
and
under
his
foot
a
chain
embattled
for
slavery
with
a
chevron
in
a
chief
engrailed
and
three
invected
lines
on
a
field
with
the
nombril
points
rampant
on
a
dancette
indented
crest
a
runaway
nigger
with
his
bundle
over
his
shoulder
on
a
bar
sinister
and
a
couple
of
gules
for
supporters
which
is
you
and
me
motto
fretta
minore
got
it
out
of
a
book
means
the
more
haste
the
less
speed
geewhillikins
i
says
but
what
does
the
rest
of
it
mean
we
ai
got
no
time
to
bother
over
that
he
says
we
got
to
dig
in
like
all
well
anyway
i
says
what
of
it
what
a
fess
a
fess
a
fess
is
do
need
to
know
what
a
fess
is
i
show
him
how
to
make
it
when
he
gets
to
it
shucks
tom
i
says
i
think
you
might
tell
a
person
what
a
bar
sinister
oh
i
do
know
but
he
got
to
have
it
all
the
nobility
does
that
was
just
his
way
if
it
did
suit
him
to
explain
a
thing
to
you
he
would
do
it
you
might
pump
at
him
a
week
it
would
make
no
difference
he
got
all
that
business
fixed
so
now
he
started
in
to
finish
up
the
rest
of
that
part
of
the
work
which
was
to
plan
out
a
mournful
inscription
said
jim
got
to
have
one
like
they
all
done
he
made
up
a
lot
and
wrote
them
out
on
a
paper
and
read
them
off
so
here
a
captive
heart
busted
here
a
poor
prisoner
forsook
by
the
world
and
friends
fretted
his
sorrowful
life
here
a
lonely
heart
broke
and
a
worn
spirit
went
to
its
rest
after
years
of
solitary
captivity
here
homeless
and
friendless
after
years
of
bitter
captivity
perished
a
noble
stranger
natural
son
of
louis
tom
voice
trembled
whilst
he
was
reading
them
and
he
most
broke
down
when
he
got
done
he
could
no
way
make
up
his
mind
which
one
for
jim
to
scrabble
onto
the
wall
they
was
all
so
good
but
at
last
he
allowed
he
would
let
him
scrabble
them
all
on
jim
said
it
would
take
him
a
year
to
scrabble
such
a
lot
of
truck
onto
the
logs
with
a
nail
and
he
did
know
how
to
make
letters
besides
but
tom
said
he
would
block
them
out
for
him
and
then
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
but
just
follow
the
lines
then
pretty
soon
he
says
come
to
think
the
logs
ai
to
do
they
do
have
log
walls
in
a
dungeon
we
got
to
dig
the
inscriptions
into
a
rock
fetch
a
rock
jim
said
the
rock
was
worse
than
the
logs
he
said
it
would
take
him
such
a
pison
long
time
to
dig
them
into
a
rock
he
would
ever
get
out
but
tom
said
he
would
let
me
help
him
do
it
then
he
took
a
look
to
see
how
me
and
jim
was
getting
along
with
the
pens
it
was
most
pesky
tedious
hard
work
and
slow
and
did
give
my
hands
no
show
to
get
well
of
the
sores
and
we
did
seem
to
make
no
headway
hardly
so
tom
says
i
know
how
to
fix
it
we
got
to
have
a
rock
for
the
coat
of
arms
and
mournful
inscriptions
and
we
can
kill
two
birds
with
that
same
rock
there
a
gaudy
big
grindstone
down
at
the
mill
and
we
smouch
it
and
carve
the
things
on
it
and
file
out
the
pens
and
the
saw
on
it
too
it
war
no
slouch
of
an
idea
and
it
war
no
slouch
of
a
grindstone
nuther
but
we
allowed
we
tackle
it
it
war
quite
midnight
yet
so
we
cleared
out
for
the
mill
leaving
jim
at
work
we
smouched
the
grindstone
and
set
out
to
roll
her
home
but
it
was
a
most
nation
tough
job
sometimes
do
what
we
could
we
could
keep
her
from
falling
over
and
she
come
mighty
near
mashing
us
every
time
tom
said
she
was
going
to
get
one
of
us
sure
before
we
got
through
we
got
her
halfway
and
then
we
was
plumb
played
out
and
most
drownded
with
sweat
we
see
it
war
no
use
we
got
to
go
and
fetch
jim
so
he
raised
up
his
bed
and
slid
the
chain
off
of
the
and
wrapt
it
round
and
round
his
neck
and
we
crawled
out
through
our
hole
and
down
there
and
jim
and
me
laid
into
that
grindstone
and
walked
her
along
like
nothing
and
tom
superintended
he
could
any
boy
i
ever
see
he
knowed
how
to
do
everything
our
hole
was
pretty
big
but
it
war
big
enough
to
get
the
grindstone
through
but
jim
he
took
the
pick
and
soon
made
it
big
enough
then
tom
marked
out
them
things
on
it
with
the
nail
and
set
jim
to
work
on
them
with
the
nail
for
a
chisel
and
an
iron
bolt
from
the
rubbage
in
the
for
a
hammer
and
told
him
to
work
till
the
rest
of
his
candle
quit
on
him
and
then
he
could
go
to
bed
and
hide
the
grindstone
under
his
straw
tick
and
sleep
on
it
then
we
helped
him
fix
his
chain
back
on
the
and
was
ready
for
bed
ourselves
but
tom
thought
of
something
and
says

last

when

you
see
all

rats
and
the
snakes
and
spiders
and
things
begin
to
feel
worried
about

and
they

in

tom
waited
to
think
it
over
and
see
if
there
was
nothing
else
and
pretty
soon
he
says
oh
there
one
thing
i
forgot
could

do

and

and
do

in

she

my
han
mars
tom
she
sholy
will
kase
i
skasely
ever

so
tom
was
stumped
but
he
studied
it
over
and
then
said
jim
would
have
to
worry
along
the
best
he
could
with
an
onion
he
promised
he
would
go
to
the
nigger
cabins
and
drop
one
private
in
in
the
morning
jim
said
he
would
jis
soon
have
tobacker
in
his
coffee
and
found
so
much
fault
with
it
and
with
the
work
and
bother
of
raising
the
mullen
and
the
rats
and
petting
and
flattering
up
the
snakes
and
spiders
and
things
on
top
of
all
the
other
work
he
had
to
do
on
pens
and
inscriptions
and
journals
and
things
which
made
it
more
trouble
and
worry
and
responsibility
to
be
a
prisoner
than
anything
he
ever
undertook
that
tom
most
lost
all
patience
with
him
and
said
he
was
just
loadened
down
with
more
gaudier
chances
than
a
prisoner
ever
had
in
the
world
to
make
a
name
for
himself
and
yet
he
did
know
enough
to
appreciate
them
and
they
was
just
about
wasted
on
him
so
jim
he
was
sorry
and
said
he
would
behave
so
no
more
and
then
me
and
tom
shoved
for
bed
chapter
xxxix
in
the
morning
we
went
up
to
the
village
and
bought
a
wire
and
fetched
it
down
and
unstopped
the
best
and
in
about
an
hour
we
had
fifteen
of
the
bulliest
kind
of
ones
and
then
we
took
it
and
put
it
in
a
safe
place
under
aunt
sally
bed
but
while
we
was
gone
for
spiders
little
thomas
franklin
benjamin
jefferson
elexander
phelps
found
it
there
and
opened
the
door
of
it
to
see
if
the
rats
would
come
out
and
they
did
and
aunt
sally
she
come
in
and
when
we
got
back
she
was
on
top
of
the
bed
raising
cain
and
the
rats
was
doing
what
they
could
to
keep
off
the
dull
times
for
her
so
she
took
and
dusted
us
both
with
the
hickry
and
we
was
as
much
as
two
hours
catching
another
fifteen
or
sixteen
drat
that
meddlesome
cub
and
they
war
the
likeliest
nuther
because
the
first
haul
was
the
pick
of
the
flock
i
never
see
a
likelier
lot
of
rats
than
what
that
first
haul
was
we
got
a
splendid
stock
of
sorted
spiders
and
bugs
and
frogs
and
caterpillars
and
one
thing
or
another
and
we
like
to
got
a
nest
but
we
did
the
family
was
at
home
we
did
give
it
right
up
but
stayed
with
them
as
long
as
we
could
because
we
allowed
tire
them
out
or
they
got
to
tire
us
out
and
they
done
it
then
we
got
allycumpain
and
rubbed
on
the
places
and
was
pretty
near
all
right
again
but
could
set
down
convenient
and
so
we
went
for
the
snakes
and
grabbed
a
couple
of
dozen
garters
and
and
put
them
in
a
bag
and
put
it
in
our
room
and
by
that
time
it
was
and
a
rattling
good
honest
day
work
and
hungry
oh
no
i
reckon
not
and
there
war
a
blessed
snake
up
there
when
we
went
back
we
did
half
tie
the
sack
and
they
worked
out
somehow
and
left
but
it
did
matter
much
because
they
was
still
on
the
premises
somewheres
so
we
judged
we
could
get
some
of
them
again
no
there
war
no
real
scarcity
of
snakes
about
the
house
for
a
considerable
spell
you
see
them
dripping
from
the
rafters
and
places
every
now
and
then
and
they
generly
landed
in
your
plate
or
down
the
back
of
your
neck
and
most
of
the
time
where
you
did
want
them
well
they
was
handsome
and
striped
and
there
war
no
harm
in
a
million
of
them
but
that
never
made
no
difference
to
aunt
sally
she
despised
snakes
be
the
breed
what
they
might
and
she
stand
them
no
way
you
could
fix
it
and
every
time
one
of
them
flopped
down
on
her
it
did
make
no
difference
what
she
was
doing
she
would
just
lay
that
work
down
and
light
out
i
never
see
such
a
woman
and
you
could
hear
her
whoop
to
jericho
you
could
get
her
to
take
of
one
of
them
with
the
tongs
and
if
she
turned
over
and
found
one
in
bed
she
would
scramble
out
and
lift
a
howl
that
you
would
think
the
house
was
afire
she
disturbed
the
old
man
so
that
he
said
he
could
most
wish
there
had
ever
been
no
snakes
created
why
after
every
last
snake
had
been
gone
clear
out
of
the
house
for
as
much
as
a
week
aunt
sally
war
over
it
yet
she
war
near
over
it
when
she
was
setting
thinking
about
something
you
could
touch
her
on
the
back
of
her
neck
with
a
feather
and
she
would
jump
right
out
of
her
stockings
it
was
very
curious
but
tom
said
all
women
was
just
so
he
said
they
was
made
that
way
for
some
reason
or
other
we
got
a
licking
every
time
one
of
our
snakes
come
in
her
way
and
she
allowed
these
lickings
war
nothing
to
what
she
would
do
if
we
ever
loaded
up
the
place
again
with
them
i
did
mind
the
lickings
because
they
did
amount
to
nothing
but
i
minded
the
trouble
we
had
to
lay
in
another
lot
but
we
got
them
laid
in
and
all
the
other
things
and
you
never
see
a
cabin
as
blithesome
as
jim
was
when
they
all
swarm
out
for
music
and
go
for
him
jim
did
like
the
spiders
and
the
spiders
did
like
jim
and
so
they
lay
for
him
and
make
it
mighty
warm
for
him
and
he
said
that
between
the
rats
and
the
snakes
and
the
grindstone
there
war
no
room
in
bed
for
him
skasely
and
when
there
was
a
body
could
sleep
it
was
so
lively
and
it
was
always
lively
he
said
because
never
all
slept
at
one
time
but
took
turn
about
so
when
the
snakes
was
asleep
the
rats
was
on
deck
and
when
the
rats
turned
in
the
snakes
come
on
watch
so
he
always
had
one
gang
under
him
in
his
way
and
gang
having
a
circus
over
him
and
if
he
got
up
to
hunt
a
new
place
the
spiders
would
take
a
chance
at
him
as
he
crossed
over
he
said
if
he
ever
got
out
this
time
he
would
ever
be
a
prisoner
again
not
for
a
salary
well
by
the
end
of
three
weeks
everything
was
in
pretty
good
shape
the
shirt
was
sent
in
early
in
a
pie
and
every
time
a
rat
bit
jim
he
would
get
up
and
write
a
line
in
his
journal
whilst
the
ink
was
fresh
the
pens
was
made
the
inscriptions
and
so
on
was
all
carved
on
the
grindstone
the
was
sawed
in
two
and
we
had
et
up
the
sawdust
and
it
give
us
a
most
amazing
we
reckoned
we
was
all
going
to
die
but
did
it
was
the
most
undigestible
sawdust
i
ever
see
and
tom
said
the
same
but
as
i
was
saying
we
got
all
the
work
done
now
at
last
and
we
was
all
pretty
much
fagged
out
too
but
mainly
jim
the
old
man
had
wrote
a
couple
of
times
to
the
plantation
below
orleans
to
come
and
get
their
runaway
nigger
but
had
got
no
answer
because
there
war
no
such
plantation
so
he
allowed
he
would
advertise
jim
in
the
louis
and
new
orleans
papers
and
when
he
mentioned
the
louis
ones
it
give
me
the
cold
shivers
and
i
see
we
had
no
time
to
lose
so
tom
said
now
for
the
nonnamous
letters
what
them
i
says
warnings
to
the
people
that
something
is
up
sometimes
it
done
one
way
sometimes
another
but
there
always
somebody
spying
around
that
gives
notice
to
the
governor
of
the
castle
when
louis
xvi
was
going
to
light
out
of
the
tooleries
a
done
it
it
a
very
good
way
and
so
is
the
nonnamous
letters
we
use
them
both
and
usual
for
the
prisoner
mother
to
change
clothes
with
him
and
she
stays
in
and
he
slides
out
in
her
clothes
we
do
that
too
but
looky
here
tom
what
do
we
want
to
anybody
for
that
something
up
let
them
find
it
out
for
themselves
it
their
lookout
yes
i
know
but
you
ca
depend
on
them
it
the
way
they
acted
from
the
very
start
left
us
to
do
they
so
confiding
and
they
do
take
notice
of
nothing
at
all
so
if
we
do
them
notice
there
wo
be
nobody
nor
nothing
to
interfere
with
us
and
so
after
all
our
hard
work
and
trouble
this
escape
go
off
perfectly
flat
wo
amount
to
nothing
wo
be
nothing
it
well
as
for
me
tom
that
the
way
i
like
shucks
he
says
and
looked
disgusted
so
i
says
but
i
ai
going
to
make
no
complaint
any
way
that
suits
you
suits
me
what
you
going
to
do
about
the
you
be
her
you
slide
in
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
hook
that
yaller
girl
frock
why
tom
that
make
trouble
next
morning
because
of
course
she
hai
got
any
but
that
one
i
know
but
you
do
want
it
but
fifteen
minutes
to
carry
the
nonnamous
letter
and
shove
it
under
the
front
door
all
right
then
i
do
it
but
i
could
carry
it
just
as
handy
in
my
own
togs
you
would
look
like
a
would
you
no
but
there
wo
be
nobody
to
see
what
i
look
like
that
ai
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
thing
for
us
to
do
is
just
to
do
our
and
not
worry
about
whether
anybody
us
do
it
or
not
hai
you
got
no
principle
at
all
all
right
i
ai
saying
nothing
i
the
who
mother
i
his
mother
i
hook
a
gown
from
aunt
sally
well
then
you
have
to
stay
in
the
cabin
when
me
and
jim
leaves
not
much
i
stuff
jim
clothes
full
of
straw
and
lay
it
on
his
bed
to
represent
his
mother
in
disguise
and
jim
take
the
nigger
woman
gown
off
of
me
and
wear
it
and
we
all
evade
together
when
a
prisoner
of
style
escapes
it
called
an
evasion
it
always
called
so
when
a
king
escapes
and
the
same
with
a
king
son
it
do
make
no
difference
whether
he
a
natural
one
or
an
unnatural
one
so
tom
he
wrote
the
nonnamous
letter
and
i
smouched
the
yaller
wench
frock
that
night
and
put
it
on
and
shoved
it
under
the
front
door
the
way
tom
told
me
to
it
said
trouble
is
brewing
keep
a
sharp
lookout
unknown
next
night
we
stuck
a
picture
which
tom
drawed
in
blood
of
a
skull
and
crossbones
on
the
front
door
and
next
night
another
one
of
a
coffin
on
the
back
door
i
never
see
a
family
in
such
a
sweat
they
could
been
worse
scared
if
the
place
had
been
full
of
ghosts
laying
for
them
behind
everything
and
under
the
beds
and
shivering
through
the
air
if
a
door
banged
aunt
sally
she
jumped
and
said
ouch
if
anything
fell
she
jumped
and
said
ouch
if
you
happened
to
touch
her
when
she
war
noticing
she
done
the
same
she
could
face
no
way
and
be
satisfied
because
she
allowed
there
was
something
behind
her
every
time
so
she
was
always
around
sudden
and
saying
ouch
and
before
she
got
around
she
whirl
back
again
and
say
it
again
and
she
was
afraid
to
go
to
bed
but
she
das
set
up
so
the
thing
was
working
very
well
tom
said
he
said
he
never
see
a
thing
work
more
satisfactory
he
said
it
showed
it
was
done
right
so
he
said
now
for
the
grand
bulge
so
the
very
next
morning
at
the
streak
of
dawn
we
got
another
letter
ready
and
was
wondering
what
we
better
do
with
it
because
we
heard
them
say
at
supper
they
was
going
to
have
a
nigger
on
watch
at
both
doors
all
night
tom
he
went
down
the
to
spy
around
and
the
nigger
at
the
back
door
was
asleep
and
he
stuck
it
in
the
back
of
his
neck
and
come
back
this
letter
said
betray
me
i
wish
to
be
your
friend
there
is
a
desprate
gang
of
cutthroats
from

in
the
indian
territory
going
to
steal
your
runaway
nigger
and
they
have
been
trying
to
scare
you
so
as
you
will
stay
in
the
house
and
not
bother
them
i
am
one
of
the
gang
but
have
got
religgion
and
wish
to
quit
it
and
lead
an
honest
life
again
and
will
betray
the
helish
design
they
will
sneak
down
from
northards
along
the
fence
at
midnight
exact
with
a
false
key
and
go
in
the
nigger
cabin
to
get
him
i
am
to
be
off
a
piece
and
blow
a
tin
horn
if
i
see
any
danger
but
stead
of
that
i
will
ba
like
a
sheep
soon
as
they
get
in
and
not
blow
at
all
then
whilst
they
are
getting
his
chains

you
slip
there
and
lock
them
in
and

your
leasure

the
way
i

chapter
xl
we
was
feeling
pretty
good
after
breakfast
and
took
my
canoe
and
went
over
the
river
with
a
lunch
and
had
a
good
time
and
took
a
look
at
the
raft
and
found
her
all
right
and
got
home
late
to
supper
and
found
them
in
such
a
sweat
and
worry
they
did
know
which
end
they
was
standing
on
and
made
us
go
right
off
to
bed
the
minute
we
was
done
supper
and
would
tell
us
what
the
trouble
was
and
never
let
on
a
word
about
the
new
letter
but
did
need
to
because
we
knowed
as
much
about
it
as
anybody
did
and
as
soon
as
we
was
half
and
her
back
was
turned
we
slid
for
the
cellar
cubboard
and
loaded
up
a
good
lunch
and
took
it
up
to
our
room
and
went
to
bed
and
got
up
about
half
past
eleven
and
tom
put
on
aunt
sally
dress
that
he
stole
and
was
going
to
start
with
the
lunch
but
says
where
the
butter
i
laid
out
a
hunk
of
it
i
says

a
piece
of
a
well

it
laid
out
then
it
ai
here
we
can
get
along
without
it
i
says
we
can
get
along
it
too
he
says
just
you
slide
down
cellar
and
fetch
it
and
then
mosey
right
down
the
and
come
along
i
go
and
stuff
the
straw
into
jim
clothes
to
represent
his
mother
in
disguise
and
be
ready
to
like
a
sheep
and
shove
soon
as
you
get
there
so
out
he
went
and
down
cellar
went
i
the
hunk
of
butter
big
as
a
person
fist
was
where
i
had
left
it
so
i
took
up
the
slab
of
with
it
on
and
blowed
out
my
light
and
started
very
stealthy
and
got
up
to
the
main
floor
all
right
but
here
comes
aunt
sally
with
a
candle
and
i
clapped
the
truck
in
my
hat
and
clapped
my
hat
on
my
head
and
the
next
second
she
see
me
and
she
says
you

down
cellar
yes
what
you
been
doing
down
there
no
well
then
what
possessed

to
go
down
there
this
time
of
night
i
do
know
you
do
do
answer
me
that
way
tom
i
want
to
know
what
you
been
down
there
i
hai
been
doing
a
single
thing
aunt
sally
i
hope
to
gracious
if
i
have
i
reckoned
she
let
me
go
now
and
as
a
generl
thing
she
would
but
i
there
was
so
many
strange
things
going
on
she
was
just
in
a
sweat
about
every
little
thing
that
war
straight
so
she
says
very
decided
you
just
march
into
that
and
stay
there
till
i
come
you
been
up
to
something
you
no
business
to
and
i
lay
i
find
out
what
it
is
before

so
she
went
away
as
i
opened
the
door
and
walked
into
the
my
but
there
was
a
crowd
there
fifteen
farmers
and
every
one
of
them
had
a
gun
i
was
most
powerful
sick
and
slunk
to
a
chair
and
set
down
they
was
setting
around
some
of
them
talking
a
little
in
a
low
voice
and
all
of
them
fidgety
and
uneasy
but
trying
to
look
like
they
war
but
i
knowed
they
was
because
they
was
always
taking
off
their
hats
and
putting
them
on
and
scratching
their
heads
and
changing
their
seats
and
fumbling
with
their
buttons
i
war
easy
myself
but
i
did
take
my
hat
off
all
the
same
i
did
wish
aunt
sally
would
come
and
get
done
with
me
and
lick
me
if
she
wanted
to
and
let
me
get
away
and
tell
tom
how
we
overdone
this
thing
and
what
a
thundering
hornet
nest
we
got
ourselves
into
so
we
could
stop
fooling
around
straight
off
and
clear
out
with
jim
before
these
rips
got
out
of
patience
and
come
for
us
at
last
she
come
and
begun
to
ask
me
questions
but
i
answer
them
straight
i
did
know
which
end
of
me
was
up
because
these
men
was
in
such
a
fidget
now
that
some
was
wanting
to
start
right
and
lay
for
them
desperadoes
and
saying
it
war
but
a
few
minutes
to
midnight
and
others
was
trying
to
get
them
to
hold
on
and
wait
for
the
and
here
was
aunty
pegging
away
at
the
questions
and
me
all
over
and
ready
to
sink
down
in
my
tracks
i
was
that
scared
and
the
place
getting
hotter
and
hotter
and
the
butter
beginning
to
melt
and
run
down
my
neck
and
behind
my
ears
and
pretty
soon
when
one
of
them
says
for
going
and
getting
in
the
cabin
and
right
and
catching
them
when
they
come
i
most
dropped
and
a
streak
of
butter
come
down
my
forehead
and
aunt
sally
she
see
it
and
turns
white
as
a
sheet
and
says
for
the
land
sake
what
the
matter
with
the
child
he
got
the
as
shore
as
you
born
and
they
oozing
out
and
everybody
runs
to
see
and
she
snatches
off
my
hat
and
out
comes
the
bread
and
what
was
left
of
the
butter
and
she
grabbed
me
and
hugged
me
and
says
oh
what
a
turn
you
did
give
me
and
how
glad
and
grateful
i
am
it
ai
no
worse
for
luck
against
us
and
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
and
when
i
see
that
truck
i
thought
we
lost
you
for
i
knowed
by
the
color
and
all
it
was
just
like
your
brains
would
be
if
dear
dear
you
me
that
was
what
you
been
down
there
for
would
cared
now
cler
out
to
bed
and
do
lem
me
see
no
more
of
you
till
morning
i
was
in
a
second
and
down
the
in
another
one
and
shinning
through
the
dark
for
the
i
could
hardly
get
my
words
out
i
was
so
anxious
but
i
told
tom
as
quick
as
i
could
we
must
jump
for
it
now
and
not
a
minute
to
lose
the
house
full
of
men
yonder
with
guns
his
eyes
just
blazed
and
he
says
no
is
that
so
it
bully
why
huck
if
it
was
to
do
over
again
i
bet
i
could
fetch
two
hundred
if
we
could
put
it
off
till
hurry
i
says
where
jim
right
at
your
elbow
if
you
reach
out
your
arm
you
can
touch
him
he
dressed
and
everything
ready
now
we
slide
out
and
give
the
but
then
we
heard
the
tramp
of
men
coming
to
the
door
and
heard
them
begin
to
fumble
with
the
padlock
and
heard
a
man
say
i
you
we
be
too
soon
they
have
come
the
door
is
locked
here
i
lock
some
of
you
into
the
cabin
and
you
lay
for
in
the
dark
and
kill
when
they
come
and
the
rest
scatter
around
a
piece
and
listen
if
you
can
hear
coming
so
in
they
come
but
could
see
us
in
the
dark
and
most
trod
on
us
whilst
we
was
hustling
to
get
under
the
bed
but
we
got
under
all
right
and
out
through
the
hole
swift
but
soft
jim
first
me
next
and
tom
last
which
was
according
to
tom
orders
now
we
was
in
the
and
heard
trampings
close
by
outside
so
we
crept
to
the
door
and
tom
stopped
us
there
and
put
his
eye
to
the
crack
but
could
make
out
nothing
it
was
so
dark
and
whispered
and
said
he
would
listen
for
the
steps
to
get
further
and
when
he
nudged
us
jim
must
glide
out
first
and
him
last
so
he
set
his
ear
to
the
crack
and
listened
and
listened
and
listened
and
the
steps
around
out
there
all
the
time
and
at
last
he
nudged
us
and
we
slid
out
and
stooped
down
not
breathing
and
not
making
the
least
noise
and
slipped
stealthy
towards
the
fence
in
injun
file
and
got
to
it
all
right
and
me
and
jim
over
it
but
tom
britches
catched
fast
on
a
splinter
on
the
top
rail
and
then
he
hear
the
steps
coming
so
he
had
to
pull
loose
which
snapped
the
splinter
and
made
a
noise
and
as
he
dropped
in
our
tracks
and
started
somebody
sings
out
who
that
answer
or
i
shoot
but
we
did
answer
we
just
unfurled
our
heels
and
shoved
then
there
was
a
rush
and
a
and
the
bullets
fairly
whizzed
around
us
we
heard
them
sing
out
here
they
are
they
broke
for
the
river
after
boys
and
turn
loose
the
dogs
so
here
they
come
full
tilt
we
could
hear
them
because
they
wore
boots
and
yelled
but
we
did
wear
no
boots
and
did
yell
we
was
in
the
path
to
the
mill
and
when
they
got
pretty
close
onto
us
we
dodged
into
the
bush
and
let
them
go
by
and
then
dropped
in
behind
them
they
had
all
the
dogs
shut
up
so
they
would
scare
off
the
robbers
but
by
this
time
somebody
had
let
them
loose
and
here
they
come
making
powwow
enough
for
a
million
but
they
was
our
dogs
so
we
stopped
in
our
tracks
till
they
catched
up
and
when
they
see
it
war
nobody
but
us
and
no
excitement
to
offer
them
they
only
just
said
howdy
and
tore
right
ahead
towards
the
shouting
and
clattering
and
then
we
again
and
whizzed
along
after
them
till
we
was
nearly
to
the
mill
and
then
struck
up
through
the
bush
to
where
my
canoe
was
tied
and
hopped
in
and
pulled
for
dear
life
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
but
did
make
no
more
noise
than
we
was
obleeged
to
then
we
struck
out
easy
and
comfortable
for
the
island
where
my
raft
was
and
we
could
hear
them
yelling
and
barking
at
each
other
all
up
and
down
the
bank
till
we
was
so
far
away
the
sounds
got
dim
and
died
out
and
when
we
stepped
onto
the
raft
i
says

gladdest
of

because
he

a
bullet
in
the
calf
of
his
leg
when
me
and
jim
heard
that
we
did
feel
as
brash
as
what
we
did
before
it
was
hurting
him
considerable
and
bleeding
so
we
laid
him
in
the
wigwam
and

forty
year
i
knowed
he

i
reckoned

what
he
did
say
so
it
was
all
right
now
and
i
told
tom
i
was
for
a
doctor
he
raised
considerable
row
about
it
but
me
and
jim
stuck
to
it
and
would
budge
so
he
was
for
crawling
out
and
setting
the
raft
loose
himself
but
we
would
let
him
then
he
give
us
a
piece
of
his
mind
but
it
did
do
no
good
so
when
he
sees
me
getting
the
canoe
ready
he
says
well
then
if
you
bound
to
go
i
tell
you
the
way
to
do
when
you
get
to
the
village
shut
the
door
and
blindfold
the
doctor
tight
and
fast
and
make
him
swear
to
be
silent
as
the
grave
and
put
a
purse
full
of
gold
in
his
hand
and
then
take
and
lead
him
all
around
the
back
alleys
and
everywheres
in
the
dark
and
then
fetch
him
here
in
the
canoe
in
a
roundabout
way
amongst
the
islands
and
search
him
and
take
his
chalk
away
from
him
and
do
give
it
back
to
him
till
you
get
him
back
to
the
village
or
else
he
will
chalk
this
raft
so
he
can
find
it
again
it
the
way
they
all
do
so
i
said
i
would
and
left
and
jim
was
to
hide
in
the
woods
when
he
see
the
doctor
coming
till
he
was
gone
again
chapter
xli
the
doctor
was
an
old
man

very
nice
old
man
when
i
got
him
up
i
told
him

a
piece
of
a

about
midnight
he
must
kicked
his
gun
in
his
dreams
for
it
went
off
and
shot
him
in
the
leg
and
we
wanted
him
to
go
over
there
and
fix
it
and
not
say
nothing
about
it
nor
let
anybody
know
because
we
wanted
to

the
canoe

did
like
the
look
of

the
three
of

says
but
he
put
his
foot
on
the
gunnel
and
rocked
her
and
shook
his
head
and
said
he
reckoned
he
look
around
for
a
bigger
one
but
they
was
all
locked
and
chained
so
he
took
my
canoe
and
said
for
me
to
wait
till
he
come
back
or
i
could
hunt
around
further
or
maybe
i
better
go
down
home
and
get
them
ready
for
the
surprise
if
i
wanted
to
but
i
said
i
did
so
i
told
him
just
how
to
find
the
raft
and
then
he
started
i
struck
an
idea
pretty
soon
i
says
to
myself
he
ca
fix
that
leg
just
in
three
shakes
of
a
sheep
tail
as
the
saying
is
it
takes
him
three
or
four
days
what
are
we
going
to
do
lay
around
there
till
he
lets
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
no
sir
i
know
what
do
i
wait
and
when
he
comes
back
if
he
says
he
got
to
go
any
more
i
get
down
there
too
if
i
swim
and
we
take
and
tie
him
and
keep
him
and
shove
out
down
the
river
and
when
tom
done
with
him
we
give
him
what
it
worth
or
all
we
got
and
then
let
him
get
ashore
so
then
i
crept
into
a
to
get
some
sleep
and
next
time
i
waked
up
the
sun
was
away
up
over
my
head
i
shot
out
and
went
for
the
doctor
house
but
they
told
me
he
gone
away
in
the
night
some
time
or
other
and
war
back
yet
well
thinks
i
that
looks
powerful
bad
for
tom
and
i
dig
out
for
the
island
right
off
so
away
i
shoved
and
turned
the
corner
and
nearly
rammed
my
head
into
uncle
stomach
he
says
why
where
you
been
all
this
time
you
rascal
hai
been
nowheres
i
says
only
just
hunting

the
runaway

sid
why
where
ever

he
says
your
aunt

says
because
we
was
all
right
we
followed
the
men
and
the
dogs
but
they
outrun
us
and
we
lost
them
but
we
thought
we
heard
them
on
the
water
so
we
got
a
canoe
and
took
out
after
them
and
crossed
over
but
could
find
nothing
of
them
so
we
cruised
along
till
we
got
kind
of
tired
and
beat
out
and
tied
up
the
canoe
and
went
to
sleep
and

about
an
hour

very
why
goodness

you

kind
of
a
fluster

time
midnight
come
last
night
i
hope
to
gracious
if
i
war
afraid
they
steal
some
o
the
family
i
was
just
to
that
pass
i
did
have
no
reasoning
faculties
no
more
it
looks
foolish
enough
in
the
daytime
but
i
says
to
myself
there
my
two
poor
boys
asleep
upstairs
in
that
lonesome
room
and
i
declare
to
goodness
i
was
that
uneasy
i
crep
up
there
and
locked
in
i
and
anybody
would
because
you
know
when
you
get
scared
that
way
and
it
keeps
running
on
and
getting
worse
and
worse
all
the
time
and
your
wits
gets
to
addling
and
you
get
to
doing
all
sorts
o
wild
things
and
by
and
by
you
think
to
yourself
i
was
a
boy
and
was
away
up
there
and
the
door
ai
locked
and
you
she
stopped
looking
kind
of
wondering
and
then
she
turned
her
head
around
slow
and
when
her
eye
lit
on
me
i
got
up
and
took
a
walk
says
i
to
myself
i
can
explain
better
how
we
come
to
not
be
in
that
room
this
morning
if
i
go
out
to
one
side
and
study
over
it
a
little
so
i
done
it
but
i
das
go
fur
or
she
sent
for
me
and
when
it
was
late
in
the
day
the
people
all
went
and
then
i
come
in
and
told
her
the
noise
and
shooting
waked
up
me
and
sid
and
the
door
was
locked
and
we
wanted
to
see
the
fun
so
we
went
down
the
and
both
of
us
got
hurt
a
little
and
we
did
never
want
to
try
no
more
and
then
i
went
on
and
told
her
all
what
i
told
uncle
silas
before
and
then
she
said
she
forgive
us
and
maybe
it
was
all
right
enough
anyway
and
about
what
a
body
might
expect
of
boys
for
all
boys
was
a
pretty
lot
as
fur
as
she
could
see
and
so
as
long
as
no
harm
had
come
of
it
she
judged
she
better
put
in
her
time
being
grateful
we
was
alive
and
well
and
she
had
us
still
stead
of
fretting
over
what
was
past
and
done
so
then
she
kissed
me
and
patted
me
on
the
head
and
dropped
into
a
kind
of
a
and
pretty
soon
jumps
up
and
says
why
lawsamercy
it
most
night
and
sid
not
come
yet
what
become
of
that
boy
i
see
my
chance
so
i
skips
up
and
says
i
run
right
up
to
town
and
get
him
i
says
no
you
wo
she
says
you
stay
right
wher
you
are
enough
to
be
lost
at
a
time
if
he
ai
here
to
supper
your
uncle
go
well
he
war
there
to
supper
so
right
after
supper
uncle
went
he
come
back
about
ten
a
little
bit
uneasy
had
run
across
track
aunt
sally
was
a
good
uneasy
but
uncle
silas
he
said
there
war
no
occasion
to
be
boys
will
be
boys
he
said
and
see
this
one
turn
up
in
the
morning
all
sound
and
right
so
she
had
to
be
satisfied
but
she
said
she
set
up
for
him
awhile
anyway
and
keep
a
light
burning
so
he
could
see
it
and
then
when
i
went
up
to
bed
she
come
up
with
me
and
fetched
her
candle
and
tucked
me
in
and
mothered
me
so
good
i
felt
mean
and
like
i
could
look
her
in
the
face
and
she
set
down
on
the
bed
and
talked
with
me
a
long
time
and
said
what
a
splendid
boy
sid
was
and
did
seem
to
want
to
ever
stop
talking
about
him
and
kept
asking
me
every
now
and
then
if
i
reckoned
he
could
got
lost
or
hurt
or
maybe
drownded
and
might
be
laying
at
this
minute
somewheres
suffering
or
dead
and
she
not
by
him
to
help
him
and
so
the
tears
would
drip
down
silent
and
i
would
tell
her
that
sid
was
all
right
and
would
be
home
in
the
morning
sure
and
she
would
squeeze
my
hand
or
maybe
kiss
me
and
tell
me
to
say
it
again
and
keep
on
saying
it
because
it
done
her
good
and
she
was
in
so
much
trouble
and
when
she
was
going
away
she
looked
down
in
my
eyes
so
steady
and
gentle
and
says
the
door
ai
going
to
be
locked
tom
and
there
the
window
and
the
rod
but
you
be
good
you
and
you
wo
go
for
sake
laws
knows
i
to
go
bad
enough
to
see
about
tom
and
was
all
intending
to
go
but
after
that
i
would
went
not
for
kingdoms
but
she
was
on
my
mind
and
tom
was
on
my
mind
so
i
slept
very
restless
and
twice
i
went
down
the
rod
away
in
the
night
and
slipped
around
front
and
see
her
setting
there
by
her
candle
in
the
window
with
her
eyes
towards
the
road
and
the
tears
in
them
and
i
wished
i
could
do
something
for
her
but
i
could
only
to
swear
that
i
would
never
do
nothing
to
grieve
her
any
more
and
the
third
time
i
waked
up
at
dawn
and
slid
down
and
she
was
there
yet
and
her
candle
was
most
out
and
her
old
gray
head
was
resting
on
her
hand
and
she
was
asleep
chapter
xlii
the
old
man
was
uptown
again
before
breakfast
but
could
get
no
track
of
tom
and
both
of
them
set
at
the
table
thinking
and
not
saying
nothing
and
looking
mournful
and
their
coffee
getting
cold
and
not
eating
anything
and
by
and
by
the
old
man
says
did
i
give
you
the
letter
what
letter
the
one
i
got
yesterday
out
of
the
no
you
did
give
me
no
letter
well
i
must
forgot
it
so
he
rummaged
his
pockets
and
then
went
off
somewheres
where
he
had
laid
it
down
and
fetched
it
and
give
it
to
her
she
says
why
it
from
petersburg
it
from
sis
i
allowed
another
walk
would
do
me
good
but
i
could
stir
but
before
she
could
break
it
open
she
dropped
it
and
run
for
she
see
something
and
so
did
i
it
was
tom
sawyer
on
a
mattress
and
that
old
doctor
and
jim
in
calico
dress
with
his
hands
tied
behind
him
and
a
lot
of
people
i
hid
the
letter
behind
the
first
thing
that
come
handy
and
rushed
she
flung
herself
at
tom
crying
and
says
oh
he
dead
he
dead
i
know
he
dead
and
tom
he
turned
his
head
a
little
and
muttered
something
or
other
which
showed
he
war
in
his
right
mind
then
she
flung
up
her
hands
and
says
he
alive
thank
god
and
that
enough
and
she
snatched
a
kiss
of
him
and
flew
for
the
house
to
get
the
bed
ready
and
scattering
orders
right
and
left
at
the
niggers
and
everybody
else
as
fast
as
her
tongue
could
go
every
jump
of
the
way
i
followed
the
men
to
see
what
they
was
going
to
do
with
jim
and
the
old
doctor
and
uncle
silas
followed
after
tom
into
the
house
the
men
was
very
huffy
and
some
of
them
wanted
to
hang
jim
for
an
example
to
all
the
other
niggers
around
there
so
they
would
be
trying
to
run
away
like
jim
done
and
making
such
a
raft
of
trouble
and
keeping
a
whole
family
scared
most
to
death
for
days
and
nights
but
the
others
said
do
do
it
it
would
answer
at
all
he
ai
our
nigger
and
his
owner
would
turn
up
and
make
us
pay
for
him
sure
so
that
cooled
them
down
a
little
because
the
people
that
always
the
most
anxious
for
to
hang
a
nigger
that
hai
done
just
right
is
always
the
very
ones
that
ai
the
most
anxious
to
pay
for
him
when
they
got
their
satisfaction
out
of
him
they
cussed
jim
considerble
though
and
give
him
a
cuff
or
two
side
the
head
once
in
a
while
but
jim
never
said
nothing
and
he
never
let
on
to
know
me
and
they
took
him
to
the
same
cabin
and
put
his
own
clothes
on
him
and
chained
him
again
and
not
to
no
this
time
but
to
a
big
staple
drove
into
the
bottom
log
and
chained
his
hands
too
and
both
legs
and
said
he
war
to
have
nothing
but
bread
and
water
to
eat
after
this
till
his
owner
come
or
he
was
sold
at
auction
because
he
did
come
in
a
certain
length
of
time
and
filled
up
our
hole
and
said
a
couple
of
farmers
with
guns
must
stand
watch
around
about
the
cabin
every
night
and
a
bulldog
tied
to
the
door
in
the
daytime
and
about
this
time
they
was
through
with
the
job
and
was
tapering
off
with
a
kind
of
generl
cussing
and
then
the
old
doctor
comes
and
takes
a
look
and
says
do
be
no
rougher
on
him
than
you
obleeged
to
because
he
a
bad
nigger
when
i
got
to
where
i
found
the
boy
i
see
i
could
cut
the
bullet
out
without
some
help
and
he
war
in
no
condition
for
me
to
leave
to
go
and
get
help
and
he
got
a
little
worse
and
a
little
worse
and
after
a
long
time
he
went
out
of
his
head
and
would
let
me
come
him
any
more
and
said
if
i
chalked
his
raft
he
kill
me
and
no
end
of
wild
foolishness
like
that
and
i
see
i
could
do
anything
at
all
with
him
so
i
says
i
got
to
have
somehow
and
the
minute
i
says
it
out
crawls
this
nigger
from
somewheres
and
says
he
help
and
he
done
it
too
and
done
it
very
well
of
course
i
judged
he
must
be
a
runaway
nigger
and
there
i
and
there
i
had
to
stick
right
straight
along
all
the
rest
of
the
day
and
all
night
it
was
a
fix
i
tell
you
i
had
a
couple
of
patients
with
the
chills
and
of
course
i
of
liked
to
run
up
to
town
and
see
them
but
i
das
because
the
nigger
might
get
away
and
then
i
be
to
blame
and
yet
never
a
skiff
come
close
enough
for
me
to
hail
so
there
i
had
to
stick
plumb
until
daylight
this
morning
and
i
never
see
a
nigger
that
was
a
better
nuss
or
faithfuler
and
yet
he
was
risking
his
freedom
to
do
it
and
was
all
tired
out
too
and
i
see
plain
enough
he
been
worked
main
hard
lately
i
liked
the
nigger
for
that
i
tell
you
gentlemen
a
nigger
like
that
is
worth
a
thousand
dollars
and
kind
treatment
too
i
had
everything
i
needed
and
the
boy
was
doing
as
well
there
as
he
would
done
at
home
better
maybe
because
it
was
so
quiet
but
there
i
with
both
of
on
my
hands
and
there
i
had
to
stick
till
about
dawn
this
morning
then
some
men
in
a
skiff
come
by
and
as
good
luck
would
have
it
the
nigger
was
setting
by
the
pallet
with
his
head
propped
on
his
knees
sound
asleep
so
i
motioned
them
in
quiet
and
they
slipped
up
on
him
and
grabbed
him
and
tied
him
before
he
knowed
what
he
was
about
and
we
never
had
no
trouble
and
the
boy
being
in
a
kind
of
a
flighty
sleep
too
we
muffled
the
oars
and
hitched
the
raft
on
and
towed
her
over
very
nice
and
quiet
and
the
nigger
never
made
the
least
row
nor
said
a
word
from
the
start
he
ai
no
bad
nigger
gentlemen
that
what
i
think
about
him
somebody
says
well
it
sounds
very
good
doctor
i
obleeged
to
say
then
the
others
softened
up
a
little
too
and
i
was
mighty
thankful
to
that
old
doctor
for
doing
jim
that
good
turn
and
i
was
glad
it
was
according
to
my
judgment
of
him
too
because
i
thought
he
had
a
good
heart
in
him
and
was
a
good
man
the
first
time
i
see
him
then
they
all
agreed
that
jim
had
acted
very
well
and
was
deserving
to
have
some
notice
took
of
it
and
reward
so
every
one
of
them
promised
right
out
and
hearty
that
they
would
cuss
him
no
more
then
they
come
out
and
locked
him
up
i
hoped
they
was
going
to
say
he
could
have
one
or
two
of
the
chains
took
off
because
they
was
rotten
heavy
or
could
have
meat
and
greens
with
his
bread
and
water
but
they
did
think
of
it
and
i
reckoned
it
war
best
for
me
to
mix
in
but
i
judged
i
get
the
doctor
yarn
to
aunt
sally
somehow
or
other
as
soon
as
i
got
through
the
breakers
that
was
laying
just
ahead
of
me
explanations
i
mean
of
how
i
forgot
to
mention
about
sid
being
shot
when
i
was
telling
how
him
and
me
put
in
that
dratted
night
paddling
around
hunting
the
runaway
nigger
but
i
had
plenty
time
aunt
sally
she
stuck
to
the
all
day
and
all
night
and
every
time
i
see
uncle
silas
mooning
around
i
dodged
him
next
morning
i
heard
tom
was
a
good
deal
better
and
they
said
aunt
sally
was
gone
to
get
a
nap
so
i
slips
to
the
and
if
i
found
him
awake
i
reckoned
we
could
put
up
a
yarn
for
the
family
that
would
wash
but
he
was
sleeping
and
sleeping
very
peaceful
too
and
pale
not
the
way
he
was
when
he
come
so
i
set
down
and
laid
for
him
to
wake
in
about
half
an
hour
aunt
sally
comes
gliding
in
and
there
i
was
up
a
stump
again
she
motioned
me
to
be
still
and
set
down
by
me
and
begun
to
whisper
and
said
we
could
all
be
joyful
now
because
all
the
symptoms
was
and
he
been
sleeping
like
that
for
ever
so
long
and
looking
better
and
peacefuler
all
the
time
and
ten
to
one
he
wake
up
in
his
right
mind
so
we
set
there
watching
and
by
and
by
he
stirs
a
bit
and
opened
his
eyes
very
natural
and
takes
a
look
and
says
hello
why
i
at
how
that
where
the
raft
it
all
right
i
says
and
the
same
i
says
but
could
say
it
pretty
brash
but
he
never
noticed
but
says
good
splendid
we
all
right
and
safe
did
you
tell
aunty
i
was
going
to
say
yes
but
she
chipped
in
and
says
about
what
sid
why
about
the
way
the
whole
thing
was
done
what
whole
thing
why
whole
thing
there
ai
but
one
how
we
set
the
runaway
nigger
free
me
and
tom
good
land
set
the
run
what
the
child
talking
about
dear
dear
out
of
his
head
again
i
ai
out
of
my
head
i
know
all
what
i
talking
about
we
set
him
free
me
and
tom
we
laid
out
to
do
it
and
we
it
and
we
done
it
elegant
too
he
got
a
start
and
she
never
checked
him
up
just
set
and
stared
and
stared
and
let
him
clip
along
and
i
see
it
war
no
use
for
to
put
in
why
aunty
it
cost
us
a
power
of
work
weeks
of
it
hours
and
hours
every
night
whilst
you
was
all
asleep
and
we
had
to
steal
candles
and
the
sheet
and
the
shirt
and
your
dress
and
spoons
and
tin
plates
and
and
the
and
the
grindstone
and
flour
and
just
no
end
of
things
and
you
ca
think
what
work
it
was
to
make
the
saws
and
pens
and
inscriptions
and
one
thing
or
another
and
you
ca
think
half
the
fun
it
was
and
we
had
to
make
up
the
pictures
of
coffins
and
things
and
nonnamous
letters
from
the
robbers
and
get
up
and
down
the
and
dig
the
hole
into
the
cabin
and
make
the
rope
ladder
and
send
it
in
cooked
up
in
a
pie
and
send
in
spoons
and
things
to
work
with
in
your
apron
pocket
mercy
sakes
and
load
up
the
cabin
with
rats
and
snake
and
so
on
for
company
for
jim
and
then
you
kept
tom
here
so
long
with
the
butter
in
his
hat
that
you
come
near
spiling
the
whole
business
because
the
men
come
before
we
was
out
of
the
cabin
and
we
had
to
rush
and
they
heard
us
and
let
drive
at
us
and
i
got
my
share
and
we
dodged
out
of
the
path
and
let
them
go
by
and
when
the
dogs
come
they
war
interested
in
us
but
went
for
the
most
noise
and
we
got
our
canoe
and
made
for
the
raft
and
was
all
safe
and
jim
was
a
free
man
and
we
done
it
all
by
ourselves
and
it
bully
aunty
well
i
never
heard
the
likes
of
it
in
all
my
born
days
so
it
was
you
little
rapscallions
that
been
making
all
this
trouble
and
turned
everybody
wits
clean
inside
out
and
scared
us
all
most
to
death
i
as
good
a
notion
as
ever
i
had
in
my
life
to
take
it
out
o
you
this
very
minute
to
think
here
i
been
night
after
night
a
just
get
well
once
you
young
scamp
and
i
lay
i
tan
the
old
harry
out
o
both
o
ye
but
tom
he
so
proud
and
joyful
he
just
hold
in
and
his
tongue
just
it
she
in
and
spitting
fire
all
along
and
both
of
them
going
it
at
once
like
a
cat
convention
and
she
says
you
get
all
the
enjoyment
you
can
out
of
it
for
mind
i
tell
you
if
i
catch
you
meddling
with
him
again
meddling
with
tom
says
dropping
his
smile
and
looking
surprised
with
why
the
runaway
nigger
of
course
who
you
reckon
tom
looks
at
me
very
grave
and
says
tom
did
you
just
tell
me
he
was
all
right
has
he
got
away
says
aunt
sally
the
runaway
nigger
he
has
they
got
him
back
safe
and
sound
and
he
in
that
cabin
again
on
bread
and
water
and
loaded
down
with
chains
till
he
claimed
or
sold
tom
rose
square
up
in
bed
with
his
eye
hot
and
his
nostrils
opening
and
shutting
like
gills
and
sings
out
to
me
they
hai
no
to
shut
him
up
and
do
you
lose
a
minute
turn
him
loose
he
ai
no
slave
he
as
free
as
any
cretur
that
walks
this
earth
what
the
child
mean
i
mean
every
word
i
aunt
sally
and
if
somebody
do
go
go
i
knowed
him
all
his
life
and
so
has
tom
there
old
miss
watson
died
two
months
ago
and
she
was
ashamed
she
ever
was
going
to
sell
him
down
the
river
and
so
and
she
set
him
free
in
her
will
then
what
on
earth
did
want
to
set
him
free
for
seeing
he
was
already
free
well
that
a
question
i
must
say
and
like
women
why
i
wanted
the
of
it
and
i
waded
in
blood
to
goodness
alive
polly
if
she
war
standing
right
there
just
inside
the
door
looking
as
sweet
and
contented
as
an
angel
half
full
of
pie
i
wish
i
may
never
aunt
sally
jumped
for
her
and
most
hugged
the
head
off
of
her
and
cried
over
her
and
i
found
a
good
enough
place
for
me
under
the
bed
for
it
was
getting
pretty
sultry
for
seemed
to
me
and
i
peeped
out
and
in
a
little
while
tom
aunt
polly
shook
herself
loose
and
stood
there
looking
across
at
tom
over
her
spectacles
kind
of
grinding
him
into
the
earth
you
know
and
then
she
says
yes
you
turn
head
away
i
would
if
i
was
you
tom
oh
deary
me
says
aunt
sally
he
changed
so
why
that
it
sid
tom
tom
why
where
is
tom
he
was
here
a
minute
ago
you
mean
where
huck
that
what
you
mean
i
reckon
i
raised
such
a
scamp
as
my
tom
all
these
years
not
to
know
him
when
i
him
that
be
a
pretty
come
out
from
under
that
bed
huck
finn
so
i
done
it
but
not
feeling
brash
aunt
sally
she
was
one
of
the
persons
i
ever
see
except
one
and
that
was
uncle
silas
when
he
come
in
and
they
told
it
all
to
him
it
kind
of
made
him
drunk
as
you
may
say
and
he
did
know
nothing
at
all
the
rest
of
the
day
and
preached
a
sermon
that
night
that
gave
him
a
rattling
ruputation
because
the
oldest
man
in
the
world
could
understood
it
so
tom
aunt
polly
she
told
all
about
who
i
was
and
what
and
i
had
to
up
and
tell
how
i
was
in
such
a
tight
place
that
when
phelps
took
me
for
tom
sawyer
she
chipped
in
and
says
oh
go
on
and
call
me
aunt
sally
i
used
to
it
now
and
no
need
to
change
that
when
aunt
sally
took
me
for
tom
sawyer
i
had
to
stand
it
there
no
other
way
and
i
knowed
he
would
mind
because
it
would
be
nuts
for
him
being
a
mystery
and
he
make
an
adventure
out
of
it
and
be
perfectly
satisfied
and
so
it
turned
out
and
he
let
on
to
be
sid
and
made
things
as
soft
as
he
could
for
me
and
his
aunt
polly
she
said
tom
was
right
about
old
miss
watson
setting
jim
free
in
her
will
and
so
sure
enough
tom
sawyer
had
gone
and
took
all
that
trouble
and
bother
to
set
a
free
nigger
free
and
i
could
ever
understand
before
until
that
minute
and
that
talk
how
he
help
a
body
set
a
nigger
free
with
his
well
aunt
polly
she
said
that
when
aunt
sally
wrote
to
her
that
tom
and
had
come
all
right
and
safe
she
says
to
herself
look
at
that
now
i
might
have
expected
it
letting
him
go
off
that
way
without
anybody
to
watch
him
so
now
i
got
to
go
and
trapse
all
the
way
down
the
river
eleven
hundred
mile
and
find
out
what
that
creetur
up
to
time
as
long
as
i
could
seem
to
get
any
answer
out
of
you
about
it
why
i
never
heard
nothing
from
you
says
aunt
sally
well
i
wonder
why
i
wrote
you
twice
to
ask
you
what
you
could
mean
by
sid
being
here
well
i
never
got
sis
aunt
polly
she
turns
around
slow
and
severe
and
says
you
tom
well
he
says
kind
of
pettish
do
you
what
you
impudent
thing
hand
out
them
letters
what
letters
letters
i
be
bound
if
i
have
to
take
of
you
i
they
in
the
trunk
there
now
and
they
just
the
same
as
they
was
when
i
got
them
out
of
the
office
i
hai
looked
into
them
i
hai
touched
them
but
i
knowed
they
make
trouble
and
i
thought
if
you
war
in
no
hurry
i
well
you
need
skinning
there
ai
no
mistake
about
it
and
i
wrote
another
one
to
tell
you
i
was
coming
and
i
he
no
it
come
yesterday
i
hai
read
it
yet
but
all
right
i
got
that
one
i
wanted
to
offer
to
bet
two
dollars
she
had
but
i
reckoned
maybe
it
was
just
as
safe
to
not
to
so
i
never
said
nothing
chapter
the
last
the
first
time
i
catched
tom
private
i
asked
him
what
was
his
idea
time
of
the
evasion
what
it
was
he
planned
to
do
if
the
evasion
worked
all
right
and
he
managed
to
set
a
nigger
free
that
was
already
free
before
and
he
said
what
he
had
planned
in
his
head
from
the
start
if
we
got
jim
out
all
safe
was
for
us
to
run
him
down
the
river
on
the
raft
and
have
adventures
plumb
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
then
tell
him
about
his
being
free
and
take
him
back
up
home
on
a
steamboat
in
style
and
pay
him
for
his
lost
time
and
write
word
ahead
and
get
out
all
the
niggers
around
and
have
them
waltz
him
into
town
with
a
torchlight
procession
and
a
and
then
he
would
be
a
hero
and
so
would
we
but
i
reckoned
it
was
about
as
well
the
way
it
was
we
had
jim
out
of
the
chains
in
no
time
and
when
aunt
polly
and
uncle
silas
and
aunt
sally
found
out
how
good
he
helped
the
doctor
nurse
tom
they
made
a
heap
of
fuss
over
him
and
fixed
him
up
prime
and
give
him
all
he
wanted
to
eat
and
a
good
time
and
nothing
to
do
and
we
had
him
up
to
the
and
had
a
high
talk
and
tom
give
jim
forty
dollars
for
being
prisoner
for
us
so
patient
and
doing
it
up
so
good
and
jim
was
pleased
most
to
death
and
busted
out
and
