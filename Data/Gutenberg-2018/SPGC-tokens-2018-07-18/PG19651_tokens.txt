leaned
forward
over

to
peer
down
at
a
beach
of
fine

came
in
languidly
and
the

which
ruffled
his

smoothed
about

body
caressed
it
did
not
buffet
on
its
way
inland
to
stir
the
growths
which
the
terran
settlers
called
trees
but
which
possessed
long
lacy
fronds
instead
of
true
branches
hawaika
named
for
the
old
polynesian
paradise
a
world
seemingly
without
flaw
except
the
subtle
one
of
being
too
perfect
too
welcoming
too
wooing
its
long
uneventful
unchanging
days
enticed
forgetfulness
offered
a
life
without
effort
except
for
the
mystery
because
this
world
was
not
the
one
pictured
on
the
tape
which
had
brought
the
terran
settlement
team
here
a
map
a
directing
guide
a
description
all
in
one
that
was
the
ancient
voyage
tape
ross
himself
had
helped
to
loot
a
storehouse
on
an
unknown
planet
for
a
cargo
of
such
tapes
once
they
had
been
the
guides
for
a
race
or
races
who
had
ruled
the
star
lanes
ten
thousand
years
in
his
own
past
a
civilization
which
had
long
since
sunk
again
into
the
dust
of
its
beginning
those
tapes
returned
to
terra
after
their
chance
discovery
were
studied
probed
deciphered
by
the
best
brains
of
his
time
shared
out
by
lot
between
already
suspicious
terran
powers
bringing
into
the
exploration
of
space
bitter
rivalries
and
old
hatreds
such
a
tape
had
landed
their
ship
on
hawaika
a
world
of
shallow
seas
and
archipelagoes
instead
of
true
continents
the
settlement
team
had
had
all
the
knowledge
contained
on
that
tape
crowded
into
them
only
to
discover
that
much
they
had
learned
from
it
was
false
of
course
none
of
them
had
expected
to
discover
here
still
the
cities
the
civilization
the
tape
had
projected
as
existing
in
that
period
but
no
present
island
string
they
had
visited
approximated
those
on
the
maps
they
had
seen
and
so
far
they
had
not
found
any
trace
that
any
intelligent
beings
had
walked
built
lived
on
these
beautiful
slumberous
atolls
so
what
had
happened
to
the
hawaika
of
the
tape
ross
right
hand
rubbed
across
the
ridged
scars
which
disfigured
his
left
one
to
be
carried
for
the
rest
of
his
life
as
a
mark
of
his
meeting
with
the
star
voyagers
in
the
past
of
his
own
world
he
had
deliberately
seared
his
own
flesh
to
break
the
mental
control
they
had
asserted
then
the
battle
had
gone
to
him
but
from
it
he
had
brought
another
scar
the
unease
of
that
old
terror
when
ross
murdock
fighter
rebel
outlaw
by
the
conventions
of
his
own
era
ross
murdock
who
considered
himself
an
exceedingly
tough
individual
that
toughness
steeled
by
the
training
for
time
agent
sorties
had
come
up
against
a
power
he
did
not
understand
instinctively
hated
and
feared
now
he
breathed
deeply
of
the
wind
the
smell
of
the
sea
the
scents
of
the
land
growths
strange
but
pleasant
so
easy
to
relax
to
drop
into
the
soft
lulling
swing
of
this
world
in
which
they
had
found
no
fault
no
danger
no
irritant
yet
once
those
others
had
been
here
the
hairless
ones
he
called
baldies
and
what
had
happened
then
or
afterward
a
black
head
brown
shoulders
slender
body
broke
the
sleepy
slip
of
the
waves
a
shimmering
mask
covered
the
face
catching
in
the
sun
two
hands
freed
a
chin
curved
yet
firmly
set
a
mouth
made
more
for
laughter
than
sternness
wide
dark
eyes
karara
trehern
of
the
alii
the
hawaiian
line
was
an
exceedingly
pretty
girl
but
ross
regarded
her
aloofly
with
a
coldness
which
bordered
on
hostility
as
she
flipped
her
mask
into
its
pocket
on
top
of
the
below
his
rocky
perch
she
came
to
a
halt
her
feet
slightly
apart
in
the
sand
an
impish
twist
to
her
lips
as
she
called
mockingly
why
not
come
in
the
water
fine
perfect
like
all
the
rest
of
this
some
of
his
impatience
came
out
in
the
sour
tone
no
luck
as
usual
as
usual
karara
conceded
if
there
ever
was
a
civilization
here
it
been
gone
so
long
we
probably
never
find
any
traces
why
you
just
pick
out
a
good
place
to
set
up
that
and
try
it
blind
ross
scowled
because
his
patience
was
exaggerated
to
the
point
of
insult
we
have
only
one
once
it
set
we
ca
tear
it
down
easily
for
transport
somewhere
else
so
we
want
to
be
sure
something
to
look
at
beyond
she
began
to
wring
the
water
out
of
her
long
hair
well
as
far
as
we
explored
nothing
come
yourself
next
time
and
taua
are
particular
they
like
company
putting
two
fingers
to
her
mouth
karara
whistled
twin
heads
popped
out
of
the
water
facing
the
shore
and
her
projecting
noses
mouths
with
upturned
corners
so
they
curved
in
a
lasting
pleasant
grin
at
the
mammals
on
the
shore
the
dolphin
pair
mammals
whose
ancestors
had
chosen
the
sea
whistled
back
in
such
close
counterfeit
of
the
signal
that
they
could
be
an
echo
of
her
call
years
earlier
their
species
intelligence
had
surprised
almost
shocked
men
experiments
training
had
developed
a
tie
which
gave
the
race
of
mankind
new
eyes
ears
minds
to
see
evaluate
and
report
concerning
an
element
in
which
the
bipeds
were
not
free
hand
in
hand
with
that
had
gone
other
experiments
just
as
the
clumsy
armored
diving
suits
of
the
early
twentieth
century
had
allowed
man
to
begin
penetration
into
a
weird
new
world
so
had
the
equipment
made
him
still
freer
in
the
sea
and
now
the
which
separated
the
needed
oxygen
from
the
water
made
even
that
lighter
burden
of
tanks
obsolete
but
there
remained
depths
into
which
man
could
not
descend
whose
secrets
were
closed
to
him
there
the
dolphins
operated
in
a
partnership
of
minds
equal
minds
though
that
last
fact
had
been
difficult
for
man
to
accept
ross
irritation
unjustified
as
he
knew
it
to
be
did
not
rest
on
or
taua
he
enjoyed
the
hours
when
he
buckled
on
and
took
to
the
sea
with
those
two
escorts
sharing
the
action
but
karara
karara
presence
was
a
different
matter
altogether
the
agents
teams
had
always
been
strictly
masculine
two
men
partnered
for
an
interlocking
of
abilities
and
temperaments
going
through
training
together
becoming
two
halves
of
a
strong
and
efficient
whole
before
being
summarily
recruited
into
the
project
ross
had
been
a
loner
living
on
the
ragged
edges
of
the
law
an
indigestible
bit
for
the
civilization
which
had
become
too
ordered
and
adjusted
to
absorb
his
kind
but
in
the
project
he
had
discovered
others
like
himself
men
born
out
of
time
too
ruthless
too
individualistic
for
their
own
age
but
able
to
operate
with
ease
in
the
dangerous
paths
of
the
time
agents
and
when
the
time
search
for
the
wrecked
alien
ships
had
succeeded
and
the
first
intact
ship
found
used
duplicated
the
agents
had
come
from
forays
into
the
past
to
be
trained
anew
for
travel
to
the
stars
first
there
had
been
ross
murdock
criminal
then
there
had
been
ross
murdock
and
gordon
ashe
time
agents
now
there
was
still
ross
and
gordon
and
a
quest
as
perilous
as
any
they
had
known
yet
this
time
they
had
to
depend
upon
karara
and
the
dolphins
tomorrow
ross
was
still
not
sorting
out
his
thoughts
truly
aware
of
the
feeling
which
worked
upon
him
as
a
thorn
in
the
finger
i
will
come
good
if
she
recognized
his
hostility
for
what
it
was
that
did
not
bother
her
once
more
she
whistled
to
the
dolphins
waved
a
casual
farewell
with
one
hand
and
headed
up
the
beach
toward
the
base
camp
ross
chose
a
more
rugged
path
over
the
cliff
suppose
they
did
not
find
what
they
sought
near
here
yet
the
old
taped
map
suggested
that
this
was
approximately
the
site
starred
upon
it
marking
a
city
a
star
port
ashe
had
volunteered
for
hawaika
demanded
this
job
after
the
disastrous
topaz
affair
when
the
team
of
apache
volunteers
had
been
sent
out
too
soon
to
counter
what
might
have
been
a
red
sneak
settlement
ross
was
still
unhappy
over
the
ensuing
months
when
only
major
kelgarries
and
maybe
in
a
lesser
part
ross
had
kept
gordon
ashe
in
the
project
at
all
that
topaz
had
been
a
failure
was
accepted
when
the
settlement
ship
did
not
return
and
that
had
added
to
ashe
sense
of
guilt
for
having
recruited
and
partially
trained
the
lost
team
among
those
dispatched
over
ashe
vehement
protests
had
been
travis
fox
who
had
shared
with
ashe
and
ross
the
first
galactic
flight
in
an
derelict
spaceship
travis
fox
the
apache
archaeologist
had
he
ever
reached
topaz
or
would
he
and
his
team
wander
forever
between
worlds
did
they
set
down
on
a
planet
where
some
inimical
form
of
native
life
or
a
red
settlement
had
awaited
them
the
very
uncertainty
of
their
fate
continued
to
ride
ashe
so
he
insisted
on
coming
out
with
the
second
settlement
team
the
volunteers
of
samoan
and
hawaiian
descent
to
carry
on
a
yet
more
exciting
and
hazardous
exploration
just
as
the
project
had
probed
into
the
past
of
terra
so
would
ashe
and
ross
now
attempt
to
discover
what
lay
in
the
past
of
hawaika
to
see
this
world
as
it
had
been
at
the
height
of
the
galactic
civilization
and
so
to
learn
what
they
could
about
their
into
space
and
the
mystery
they
had
dropped
into
upon
landing
added
to
the
necessity
for
that
discovery
or
discoveries
their
probe
if
fortune
favored
them
might
become
a
gate
through
time
the
installation
was
a
vast
improvement
over
these
passage
points
they
had
first
devised
technical
information
had
taken
a
vast
leap
forward
after
terran
engineers
and
scientists
had
had
access
to
the
tapes
of
the
stellar
empire
adaptations
and
shortcuts
developed
so
that
a
new
hybrid
technology
came
into
use
woven
from
the
knowledge
and
experimentation
of
two
civilizations
thousands
of
years
apart
in
time
if
and
when
he
or
ashe
or
karara
and
her
dolphins
discovered
the
proper
site
the
two
agents
could
set
up
their
own
equipment
both
ross
and
ashe
had
had
enough
drill
in
the
process
all
they
needed
was
the
brick
of
discovery
then
they
could
build
their
wall
but
they
must
find
some
remainder
of
the
past
the
smallest
trace
of
ancient
ruin
upon
which
to
center
their
and
since
landing
here
the
long
days
had
flowed
into
weeks
with
no
such
discovery
made
ross
crossed
the
ridge
of
rock
which
formed
a
rise
on
the
island
spine
and
descended
to
the
village
as
they
had
been
trained
the
polynesian
settlers
adapted
native
products
to
their
own
heritage
of
building
and
tools
it
was
necessary
that
they
live
off
the
land
for
their
transport
ship
had
had
storage
space
only
for
a
limited
number
of
supplies
and
tools
after
it
took
off
to
return
home
they
would
be
wholly
on
their
own
for
several
years
their
ship
a
silvery
ball
rested
on
a
rock
ledge
its
pilot
and
crew
having
lingered
to
learn
the
results
of
ashe
search
four
days
more
and
they
would
have
to
lift
for
home
even
if
the
agents
still
had
only
negative
results
to
report
that
disappointment
was
driving
ashe
the
way
that
six
months
earlier
his
outrage
and
guilt
feelings
over
the
topaz
affair
had
driven
him
karara
suggestion
carried
weight
the
longer
ross
thought
about
it
with
more
swimmers
hunting
there
was
just
that
much
increased
chance
of
turning
up
some
clue
so
far
the
dolphins
had
not
reported
any
dangerous
native
sea
life
or
any
perils
except
the
natural
ones
any
diver
always
had
at
his
shoulder
under
the
waves
there
were
extra
and
all
of
the
settlers
were
good
swimmers
an
organized
hunt
ought
to
shake
the
polynesians
out
of
their
present
attitude
as
long
as
they
had
had
definite
work
before
them
the
unloading
of
the
ship
the
building
of
the
village
all
the
labors
incidental
to
the
establishing
of
this
base
they
had
shown
energy
and
enthusiasm
it
was
only
during
the
last
couple
of
weeks
that
the
languor
which
appeared
part
of
the
atmosphere
here
had
crept
up
on
them
so
that
now
they
were
content
to
live
at
a
slower
and
lazier
pace
ross
remembered
ashe
comparison
made
the
evening
before
likening
hawaika
to
a
legendary
terran
island
where
the
inhabitants
lived
a
drugged
existence
feeding
upon
the
seeds
of
a
native
plant
hawaika
was
fast
becoming
a
lotus
land
for
terrans
through
here
then
westward
ashe
hunched
over
the
crate
table
in
the
house
he
did
not
look
up
as
ross
entered
karara
still
damp
head
was
bowed
until
those
black
locks
now
sleeked
to
her
round
skull
almost
touched
the
man
brown
hair
they
were
both
studying
a
map
as
if
they
saw
not
lines
on
paper
but
the
actual
inlets
and
lagoons
which
that
drawing
represented
you
are
sure
gordon
that
this
the
modern
point
to
match
the
site
on
the
tape
the
girl
brushed
back
straying
hair
ashe
shrugged
there
were
tight
brackets
about
his
mouth
which
had
not
been
there
six
months
ago
he
moved
jerkily
not
with
the
fluid
grace
of
those
old
days
when
he
had
faced
the
vast
distance
of
time
travel
with
unruffled
calm
and
a
to
steady
and
support
the
novice
ross
the
general
outline
of
these
two
islands
could
stand
for
the
capes
on
this
he
pulled
a
second
map
this
on
transparent
plastic
to
fit
over
the
first
the
capes
marked
on
the
much
larger
body
of
land
did
slip
over
the
modern
islands
with
a
surprising
fit
the
once
large
island
shattered
and
broken
could
have
produced
the
groups
of
atolls
and
islets
they
now
prospected
how
long
karara
mused
aloud
and
why
ashe
shrugged
ten
thousand
years
five
two
he
shook
his
head
we
have
no
idea
it
apparent
that
there
must
have
been
some
cataclysm
here
to
change
the
contours
of
the
land
masses
so
much
we
may
have
to
wait
on
a
return
space
flight
to
bring
a
or
a
hydroplane
to
explore
farther
his
hand
swept
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
map
to
indicate
the
whole
of
hawaika
a
year
maybe
two
before
we
could
hope
for
that
ross
cut
in
then
we
have
to
depend
on
whether
the
council
believes
this
important
enough
the
contrariness
which
spiked
his
tongue
whenever
karara
was
present
made
him
say
that
without
thinking
then
the
twitch
of
lip
brought
home
ross
error
gordon
needed
reassurance
now
not
a
recitation
of
the
various
ways
their
mission
could
be
doomed
look
here
ross
came
to
the
table
his
hand
sweeping
past
karara
as
he
used
his
forefinger
for
a
pointer
we
know
that
what
we
want
could
be
easily
overlooked
even
with
the
dolphins
helping
us
to
check
this
whole
area
too
big
and
you
know
that
it
is
certain
that
whatever
might
be
down
there
would
be
hidden
with
sea
growths
suppose
ten
of
us
start
out
in
a
from
about
here
and
go
as
far
as
this
point
heading
inland
here
and
here
comb
the
whole
sector
inch
by
inch
if
we
have
to
after
all
we
have
plenty
of
time
and
manpower
karara
laughed
softly
manpower
always
manpower
ross
but
there
is
too
and
we
have
perhaps
even
sharper
sight
but
this
is
a
good
idea
gordon
let
me
see
she
began
to
tell
off
names
on
her
fingers
pakeekee
vaeoha
hori
liliha
taema
ui
they
are
the
best
in
the
water
me
you
gordon
ross
that
makes
ten
with
keen
eyes
to
look
and
always
there
are
and
taua
we
will
take
supplies
and
camp
here
on
this
island
which
looks
so
much
like
a
finger
crooked
to
beckon
yes
somehow
that
beckoning
finger
seems
to
me
to
promise
better
fortune
shall
we
plan
it
so
some
of
the
tight
look
was
gone
from
ashe
face
and
ross
relaxed
this
was
what
gordon
needed
not
to
be
sitting
in
here
going
over
maps
reports
reworking
over
and
over
their
scant
leads
ashe
had
always
been
a
field
man
and
the
settlement
work
had
been
stultifying
a
laborious
chore
for
him
when
karara
had
gone
ross
dropped
down
on
the
bunk
against
the
side
wall
what
happen
here
do
you
think
half
was
real
interest
in
the
mystery
they
had
mulled
over
and
over
since
they
had
landed
on
a
hawaika
which
diverged
so
greatly
from
the
maps
the
other
half
a
desire
to
keep
ashe
thinking
on
a
subject
removed
from
immediate
worries
an
atomic
war
could
be
there
are
old
radiation
traces
but
these
aliens
had
sure
progressed
beyond
atomics
suppose
just
suppose
they
could
tamper
with
the
weather
with
the
balance
of
the
planet
crust
we
do
know
the
extent
of
their
powers
how
they
would
use
them
they
had
a
colony
here
once
or
there
would
have
been
no
guide
tape
and
that
is
all
we
are
sure
of
suppose
ross
rolled
over
on
his
stomach
pillowed
his
head
on
his
arms
we
could
uncover
some
of
that
knowledge
the
twitch
was
back
at
ashe
lips
that
the
risk
we
have
to
run
now
risk
would
you
give
a
child
one
of
those
hand
weapons
we
found
in
the
derelict
naturally
not
ross
snapped
and
then
saw
the
point
you
mean
are
to
be
trusted
the
answer
was
plain
to
read
in
ashe
expression
then
why
this
whole
setup
this
hunt
for
what
might
mean
trouble
the
old
pinch
the
bad
one
what
if
the
reds
discover
something
first
they
drew
some
planets
in
the
tape
lottery
remember
it
a
seesaw
between
us
we
advance
here
they
there
we
have
to
keep
up
the
race
or
lose
it
they
must
be
combing
their
stellar
colonies
for
a
few
answers
just
as
furiously
as
we
are
so
we
go
into
the
past
to
hunt
if
we
have
to
well
i
think
i
could
do
without
answers
such
as
the
baldies
would
know
but
i
will
admit
that
i
would
like
to
know
what
did
happen
here
two
five
ten
thousand
years
ago
ashe
stood
up
and
stretched
for
the
first
time
he
smiled
do
you
know
i
rather
like
the
idea
of
fishing
off
karara
beckoning
finger
maybe
she
right
about
that
changing
our
luck
ross
kept
his
face
carefully
expressionless
as
he
got
up
to
prepare
their
evening
meal
lair
of
just
under
the
surface
of
the
water
the
sea
was
warm
weird
life
showed
colors
ross
could
name
shades
he
could
not
the
corals
the
animals
masquerading
as
plants
the
plants
disguised
as
animals
which
inhabited
the
oceans
of
terra
had
their
counterparts
here
and
the
settlers
had
given
them
the
familiar
names
though
the
crabs
the
fish
the
anemones
and
weeds
of
the
shallow
lagoons
and
reefs
were
not
identical
with
terran
creatures
the
trouble
was
that
there
was
too
much
such
a
wealth
of
life
to
attract
the
eyes
hold
attention
that
it
was
difficult
to
keep
to
the
job
at
hand
the
search
for
what
was
not
natural
for
what
had
no
normal
place
here
as
the
land
seduced
the
senses
and
bewitched
the
so
did
the
sea
have
its
enchantment
to
pull
one
from
duty
ross
resolutely
skimmed
by
a
forest
of
weaving
waving
lace
which
varied
from
a
green
which
was
almost
black
to
a
pale
tint
he
could
not
truly
identify
among
those
waving
fans
lurked
finned
swimmers
transparent
enough
so
that
one
could
sight
through
their
pallid
sides
the
evidences
of
recently
ingested
meals
the
terrans
had
begun
their
a
half
hour
ago
slipping
overboard
from
a
ferry
canoe
heading
in
toward
the
checkpoint
of
the
finger
isle
forming
an
arc
of
expert
divers
men
and
girls
so
at
home
in
the
ocean
that
they
should
be
able
to
make
the
discovery
ashe
needed
if
such
did
exist
mystery
built
upon
mystery
on
hawaika
ross
thought
as
he
used
his
to
push
aside
a
floating
banner
of
weed
in
order
to
peer
below
its
curtain
the
native
life
of
this
world
must
always
have
been
largely
aquatic
the
settlers
had
discovered
only
a
few
small
animals
on
the
islands
the
largest
of
which
was
the
burrower
a
creature
not
unlike
a
miniature
monkey
in
that
it
had
hind
legs
on
which
it
walked
erect
and
forepaws
well
clawed
for
digging
purposes
which
it
used
with
as
much
skill
and
dexterity
as
a
man
used
hands
its
body
was
hairless
and
it
was
able
to
assume
the
color
of
the
soil
and
rocks
where
it
denned
the
head
was
set
directly
on
its
bowed
shoulders
without
vestige
of
neck
and
it
had
round
bubbles
of
eyes
near
the
top
of
its
skull
a
nose
which
was
a
single
vertical
slit
and
a
wide
mouth
fanged
for
crushing
the
shelled
creatures
on
which
it
fed
all
in
all
to
terran
eyes
it
was
a
vaguely
repulsive
creature
but
as
far
as
the
settlers
had
been
able
to
discover
it
was
the
highest
form
of
land
life
the
smaller
rodentlike
things
the
two
species
of
wingless
diving
birds
and
an
odd
assortment
of
reptiles
and
amphibians
sharing
the
island
were
all
the
burrowers
prey
a
world
of
sea
and
islands
what
type
of
native
intelligent
life
had
it
once
supported
or
had
this
been
only
a
galactic
colony
with
no
native
population
before
the
coming
of
the
stellar
explorers
ross
hovered
above
a
dark
pocket
where
the
bottom
had
suddenly
dipped
into
a
depression
the
sea
growth
about
the
rim
rippled
in
the
water
raggedly
but
there
was
something
about
its
general
outline
ross
began
a
circumference
of
that
hollow
allowing
for
the
distortion
of
the
growths
which
had
formed
lumpy
excrescences
or
reached
turrets
toward
the
surface
yes
allowing
for
those
this
was
decidedly
something
out
of
the
ordinary
the
depression
was
too
regular
too
even
ross
was
certain
of
that
with
a
thrill
of
excitement
he
began
a
descent
into
the
cup
striving
to
trace
signs
which
would
prove
his
suspicion
correct
how
many
years
centuries
had
the
slow
coverage
of
the
sea
life
gathered
there
flourished
died
with
other
creatures
to
build
anew
on
the
remains
now
there
was
only
a
hint
that
the
depression
had
other
than
a
natural
beginning
anchoring
with
a
grip
on
a
spike
of
hawaikan
coral
smoother
than
the
terran
species
ross
aimed
the
butt
of
his
at
the
nearest
wall
of
the
saucer
striving
to
reach
into
a
crevice
between
two
lumps
of
growth
and
so
probe
into
what
might
lie
behind
the
spear
rebounded
there
was
no
breaking
that
crust
with
such
a
fragile
tool
but
perhaps
he
would
have
better
luck
lower
down
the
depression
was
deeper
than
he
had
first
judged
now
the
light
which
existed
in
the
shallows
vanished
red
and
yellow
as
colors
went
but
ross
was
aware
of
blues
and
greens
in
shades
and
tints
which
were
not
visible
above
he
switched
on
his
diving
torch
and
color
returned
within
its
beam
a
swirl
of
weed
pink
in
the
light
became
darkly
emerald
beyond
as
if
it
possessed
the
chameleon
ability
of
the
burrowers
he
was
distracted
by
that
phenomenon
and
so
he
transgressed
the
rule
of
never
becoming
so
absorbed
in
surroundings
as
to
forget
caution
just
when
did
ross
become
aware
of
that
shadow
below
was
it
when
a
school
of
burst
unexpectedly
between
weed
growths
and
he
turned
to
follow
them
with
the
torch
then
the
outer
edge
of
his
beam
caught
the
movement
of
a
shape
a
flutter
in
the
water
of
the
gloomy
depths
ross
swung
around
his
back
to
the
wall
of
the
saucer
as
he
aimed
the
torch
down
at
what
was
arising
there
the
light
caught
and
held
for
a
long
moment
of
horror
something
which
might
have
come
out
of
the
nightmares
of
his
own
world
afterward
ross
knew
that
the
monster
was
not
as
large
as
it
seemed
in
that
endless
minute
of
fear
perhaps
no
bigger
than
the
dolphins
he
had
had
training
in
seas
on
terra
been
carefully
briefed
against
the
danger
from
such
hunters
of
the
deep
and
ocean
jungles
but
this
kind
of
thing
had
only
existed
before
in
the
fairy
tales
of
his
race
as
the
dragon
of
old
lore
a
scaled
head
with
wide
eyes
gleaming
in
the
light
beam
with
cold
and
sullen
hate
a
gaping
mouth
a
muzzle
that
long
undulating
neck
and
below
it
the
bulk
of
a
monstrous
body
his
the
knife
at
his
waist
belt
neither
were
protection
against
this
yet
to
turn
his
back
on
that
rising
head
was
more
than
ross
could
do
he
pulled
himself
back
against
the
wall
of
the
saucer
the
thing
before
him
did
not
rush
to
attack
plainly
it
had
seen
him
and
now
it
moved
with
the
leisure
of
a
hunter
having
no
fears
concerning
the
eventual
outcome
of
the
hunt
but
the
light
appeared
to
puzzle
it
and
ross
kept
the
beam
shining
straight
into
those
evil
eyes
the
shock
of
the
encounter
was
wearing
off
now
ross
edged
his
flipper
into
a
crevice
to
hold
him
steady
while
his
hand
went
to
the
at
his
waist
he
tapped
out
a
distress
call
which
the
dolphins
could
relay
to
the
swimmers
the
swaying
dragon
head
paused
held
rigid
on
a
stiff
scaled
column
in
the
center
of
the
saucer
that
sonic
vibration
either
surprised
or
bothered
the
hunter
made
it
wary
ross
tapped
again
the
belief
that
if
he
tried
to
escape
he
was
lost
that
only
while
he
faced
it
so
had
he
any
chance
grew
stronger
the
head
was
only
inches
below
the
level
of
his
flippered
feet
as
he
held
to
the
weeds
again
that
weaving
movement
the
rise
of
head
a
tremor
along
the
serpent
neck
an
agitation
in
the
depths
the
dragon
was
on
the
move
again
ross
aimed
the
light
directly
at
the
head
the
scales
as
far
as
he
could
determine
were
not
horny
plates
but
lapped
silvery
ovals
such
as
a
fish
possessed
and
the
underparts
of
the
monster
might
even
be
vulnerable
to
his
spear
but
knowing
the
way
a
terran
shark
could
absorb
the
darts
of
that
weapon
and
survive
ross
feared
to
attack
except
as
a
last
resort
above
and
to
his
left
there
was
a
small
hollow
where
in
the
past
some
portion
of
the
growths
had
been
ripped
away
if
he
could
fit
himself
into
that
crevice
perhaps
he
could
keep
the
dragon
at
bay
until
help
arrived
ross
moved
with
all
the
skill
he
had
his
hand
closed
upon
the
edge
of
the
niche
and
he
whirled
himself
up
just
making
it
into
that
refuge
as
the
head
lashed
at
him
wickedly
his
suspicion
that
the
dragon
would
attack
anything
on
the
run
was
well
founded
and
he
knew
he
had
no
hope
of
winning
to
the
surface
above
now
he
stood
in
the
crevice
facing
outward
watching
the
head
darting
in
the
water
he
had
switched
off
the
torch
and
the
loss
of
light
appeared
to
bewilder
the
reptile
for
some
precious
seconds
ross
pulled
as
far
back
into
the
niche
as
he
could
until
the
point
of
one
shoulder
touched
a
surface
which
was
sleek
smooth
and
cold
the
shock
of
that
contact
almost
sent
him
hurtling
out
again
gripping
the
spear
before
him
in
his
right
hand
ross
cautiously
felt
behind
him
with
the
left
his
finger
tips
glided
over
a
seamless
surface
where
the
growths
had
been
torn
or
peeled
away
though
he
could
not
or
dared
not
turn
his
head
to
see
he
was
certain
that
this
was
his
proof
that
the
walls
of
the
saucer
had
been
fashioned
and
placed
there
by
some
intelligent
creature
the
dragon
had
risen
hovering
now
in
the
water
directly
before
the
entrance
to
ross
hole
its
neck
curled
back
against
its
bulk
it
had
wide
flippers
moving
like
planes
to
hold
it
poised
the
body
sloping
from
a
massive
round
of
shoulders
to
a
tapering
rear
was
vaguely
familiar
if
one
provided
a
terran
seal
with
a
gorgon
head
and
scales
in
place
of
fur
the
effect
would
be
similar
but
ross
was
assuredly
not
facing
a
seal
at
this
moment
slight
movement
of
the
flippers
kept
it
as
stabilized
as
if
it
sprawled
on
a
supporting
surface
with
the
neck
flattened
against
the
body
the
head
curved
downward
until
the
horn
on
its
snout
pointed
the
tip
straight
at
ross
middle
the
terran
steadied
his
the
dragon
eyes
were
its
most
vulnerable
targets
if
the
creature
launched
the
attack
ross
would
aim
for
them
both
man
and
dragon
were
so
intent
upon
their
duel
that
neither
was
conscious
of
the
sudden
swirl
overhead
a
sleek
dark
shape
struck
down
skimming
across
the
ridge
of
the
dragon
some
of
the
settlers
had
empathy
with
the
dolphins
to
a
high
degree
but
ross
own
powers
of
contact
were
relatively
feeble
only
now
he
was
given
an
assurance
of
aid
and
a
suggestion
to
attack
the
dragon
head
writhed
twisted
as
the
reptile
attempted
to
see
above
and
behind
its
own
length
but
the
dolphin
was
only
a
streak
fast
disappearing
and
that
writhing
changed
the
balance
the
monster
had
maintained
pushing
it
toward
ross
the
terran
fired
too
soon
and
without
proper
aim
so
the
dart
snaked
past
the
head
but
the
harpoon
line
half
hooked
about
the
neck
and
seemed
to
confuse
the
creature
ross
squirmed
as
far
back
as
he
could
into
his
refuge
and
drew
his
knife
against
those
fangs
the
weapon
was
an
almost
useless
toy
but
it
was
all
he
had
again
the
dolphin
dived
in
attack
on
the
reptile
this
time
seizing
in
its
mouth
the
floating
cord
of
the
harpoon
and
giving
it
a
jerk
which
jolted
the
dragon
even
more
off
balance
pulling
it
away
from
niche
and
out
into
the
center
of
the
saucer
there
were
two
dolphins
in
action
now
ross
saw
playing
the
dragon
as
matadors
might
play
a
bull
keeping
the
creature
disturbed
by
their
agile
maneuvers
whatever
prey
came
naturally
to
the
hawaikan
monster
was
not
of
this
type
and
the
creature
was
not
prepared
to
deal
effectively
with
their
teasing
dodging
tactics
neither
had
touched
the
beast
but
they
kept
it
constantly
striving
to
get
at
them
though
it
swam
in
circles
attempting
to
face
its
teasers
the
dragon
did
not
abandon
the
level
before
ross
refuge
and
now
and
then
it
darted
its
head
at
him
unwilling
to
give
up
its
prey
only
one
of
the
dolphins
frisked
and
dodged
above
now
as
the
sonic
on
ross
belt
vibrated
against
his
lower
ribs
with
its
message
warning
to
be
prepared
for
further
action
somewhere
above
his
own
kind
gathered
hurriedly
he
tapped
out
in
code
his
warning
in
return
two
dolphins
busy
again
their
last
dive
over
the
dragon
pushing
the
monster
down
past
ross
niche
toward
the
saucer
depths
then
they
flashed
up
and
away
the
dragon
was
rising
in
turn
but
coming
to
meet
the
hawaikan
creature
was
a
ball
giving
off
light
bringing
sharp
vision
and
color
with
it
ross
arm
swung
up
to
shield
his
eyes
there
was
a
flash
such
answering
vibration
carried
through
the
waves
that
even
his
nerves
far
less
sensitive
than
those
of
the
life
about
him
reacted
he
blinked
behind
his
mask
a
fish
floated
by
spiraling
up
its
belly
exposed
and
about
him
growths
drooped
trailed
lifelessly
through
the
water
while
there
was
a
now
motionless
bulk
sinking
to
the
obscurity
of
the
depression
floor
a
weapon
perfected
on
terra
to
use
against
sharks
and
barracuda
had
worked
here
to
kill
what
could
have
been
more
formidable
prey
the
terran
wriggled
out
of
the
niche
rose
to
meet
another
swimmer
as
ashe
descended
ross
relayed
his
news
via
the
sonic
the
dolphins
were
already
nosing
into
the
depths
in
pursuit
of
their
late
enemy
look
here
ross
guided
ashe
to
the
crevice
which
had
saved
him
aimed
the
torch
beam
into
it
he
had
been
right
there
was
a
long
groove
in
the
covering
built
up
by
the
growths
a
vertical
strip
some
six
feet
long
of
a
uniform
gray
showed
ashe
touched
the
find
and
then
gave
the
alert
via
the
sonic
code
metal
or
an
alloy
we
found
it
but
what
did
they
have
even
after
an
hour
exploration
by
the
full
company
ashe
expert
search
with
his
knowledge
of
artifacts
and
ancient
remains
they
were
still
baffled
it
would
require
labor
and
tools
they
did
not
have
to
clear
the
whole
of
the
saucer
they
could
be
sure
only
of
its
size
and
shape
and
the
fact
that
its
walls
were
of
an
unknown
substance
which
the
sea
could
cloak
but
not
erode
for
the
length
of
gray
surface
showed
not
the
slightest
pitting
or
time
wear
down
at
its
centermost
point
they
found
the
dragon
den
an
arch
coated
with
growth
before
which
sprawled
the
body
of
the
creature
that
was
dragged
aloft
with
the
dolphins
aid
to
be
taken
ashore
for
study
but
the
arch
itself
was
that
part
of
some
old
installation
torches
to
the
fore
they
entered
its
shadow
only
to
remain
baffled
here
and
there
were
patches
of
the
same
gray
showing
in
its
interior
ashe
dug
the
butt
of
his
into
the
sand
on
the
flooring
to
uncover
another
oval
depression
but
what
it
all
signified
or
what
had
been
its
purpose
they
could
not
guess
set
up
the
here
ross
asked
ashe
head
moved
in
a
slow
negative
look
farther
spread
out
the
sonic
clicked
within
a
matter
of
minutes
the
dolphins
reported
new
remains
two
more
saucers
each
larger
than
the
first
set
in
a
line
on
the
ocean
floor
pointing
directly
to
karara
finger
island
cautiously
explored
these
were
discovered
to
be
free
of
any
but
harmless
life
they
stirred
up
no
more
dragons
when
the
terrans
came
ashore
on
finger
island
to
rest
and
eat
their
midday
meal
one
of
the
men
paced
along
the
beached
dragon
ashore
it
lost
none
of
its
frightening
aspect
and
seeing
it
even
beached
and
dead
ross
wondered
at
his
luck
in
surviving
the
encounter
without
a
scratch
i
think
that
this
one
would
be
alone
pakeekee
commented
where
there
is
an
eater
of
this
size
there
is
usually
only
one
the
girl
taema
shivered
as
she
gave
to
this
monster
the
name
of
the
shark
demon
of
her
people
such
a
one
is
truly
king
shark
in
these
waters
but
why
have
we
not
sighted
its
like
before
taua
they
have
not
reported
such
probably
because
as
pakeekee
says
these
things
are
rare
ashe
returned
a
carnivore
of
size
would
have
to
have
a
fairly
wide
hunting
range
yet
there
evidence
that
this
thing
has
laired
in
that
den
for
some
time
which
means
that
it
must
have
a
defined
hunting
territory
allowing
no
trespassing
from
others
of
its
species
karara
nodded
also
it
may
hunt
only
at
intervals
eat
heavily
and
lie
quiet
until
that
meal
is
digested
there
are
large
snakes
on
terra
that
follow
that
pattern
ross
was
in
its
front
yard
when
it
came
after
him
from
now
on
ashe
swallowed
a
quarter
of
fruit
we
know
what
to
watch
for
and
the
weapon
which
will
finish
it
off
do
forget
that
the
delicate
mechanisms
of
their
sonics
had
already
registered
the
vibrations
which
would
warn
of
a
dragon
presence
and
the
depth
globes
would
then
do
the
rest
big
skull
oversize
for
the
body
pakeekee
squatted
on
his
heels
by
the
head
lying
on
the
sand
at
the
end
of
the
now
fully
extended
neck
ross
had
heretofore
been
more
aware
of
the
armament
of
that
head
the
fangs
set
in
the
powerful
jaws
the
horn
on
the
snout
but
comment
drew
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
skull
did
dome
up
above
the
eye
pits
in
a
way
to
suggest
ample
brain
room
had
the
thing
been
intelligent
karara
put
that
into
words
rule
one
she
went
over
to
survey
the
carcass
ross
resented
her
half
question
whether
it
was
addressed
to
him
or
mere
thinking
aloud
on
her
part
rule
one
conserve
native
life
to
the
fullest
extent
humanoid
form
may
not
be
the
only
evidence
of
intelligence
there
were
the
dolphins
to
prove
that
point
right
on
terra
but
did
rule
one
mean
that
you
had
to
let
a
monster
nibble
at
you
because
it
might
just
be
a
high
type
of
alien
intelligence
let
karara
spout
rule
one
while
backed
into
a
crevice
under
water
with
that
horn
stabbing
at
her
rule
one
does
not
mean
to
forego
ashe
commented
mildly
this
thing
is
a
hunter
and
you
ca
stop
to
apply
recognition
techniques
when
you
are
being
regarded
as
legitimate
prey
if
you
are
the
stronger
or
an
equal
yes
stop
and
think
before
becoming
aggressive
but
in
a
situation
like
this
take
no
chances
anyway
from
now
on
karara
pointed
out
it
could
be
possible
to
shock
instead
of
kill
gordon
pakeekee
swung
around
what
have
we
found
here
besides
this
thing
i
ca
even
guess
except
that
those
depressions
were
made
for
a
purpose
and
have
been
there
for
a
long
time
whether
they
were
originally
in
the
water
or
the
land
sank
that
we
do
know
either
but
now
we
have
a
site
to
set
up
the
we
do
that
right
away
ross
wanted
to
know
impatience
bit
at
him
but
ashe
still
had
a
trace
of
frown
he
shook
his
head
have
to
make
sure
of
our
site
very
sure
i
do
want
to
start
any
chain
reaction
on
the
other
side
of
the
time
wall
and
he
was
right
ross
was
forced
to
admit
remembering
what
had
happened
when
the
galactics
had
discovered
the
red
time
gates
and
traced
them
forward
to
their
source
ruthlessly
destroying
each
station
the
original
colonists
of
hawaika
had
been
as
giants
to
terran
pygmies
when
it
came
to
technical
knowledge
to
use
even
a
indiscreetly
near
one
of
their
outposts
might
bring
swift
and
terrible
retribution
the
ancient
mariners
another
map
spread
out
and
this
time
pinned
down
with
small
stones
on
beach
gravel
here
here
and
here
ashe
finger
indicated
the
points
marked
in
a
pattern
which
flared
out
from
three
sides
of
finger
island
each
marked
a
set
of
three
undersea
depressions
in
perfect
alliance
with
the
land
which
according
to
the
galactic
map
had
once
been
a
cape
on
a
much
larger
land
mass
though
the
terrans
had
found
the
ruins
if
those
saucers
in
the
sea
could
be
so
termed
the
remains
had
no
meaning
for
the
explorers
do
we
set
up
here
ross
asked
if
we
could
just
get
a
report
to
send
back
that
might
mean
the
difference
between
awakening
the
of
the
project
policy
makers
so
that
a
flood
of
supplies
and
personnel
would
begin
to
head
their
way
we
set
up
here
ashe
decided
he
had
selected
a
point
between
two
of
the
lines
where
a
reef
would
provide
them
with
a
secure
base
and
once
that
decision
was
made
the
terrans
went
into
action
two
days
to
go
to
install
the
and
take
some
shots
before
the
ship
had
to
clear
with
or
without
their
evidence
together
ross
and
ashe
floated
the
installation
out
to
the
reef
ui
and
karara
helping
to
tow
the
equipment
and
parts
the
dolphins
lending
pushing
noses
on
occasion
the
aquatic
mammals
were
as
interested
as
the
human
beings
they
aided
and
in
water
their
help
was
invaluable
had
dolphins
developed
hands
ross
wondered
fleetingly
would
they
have
long
ago
wrested
control
of
their
native
world
or
at
least
of
its
seas
from
the
human
kind
all
the
human
beings
worked
with
practiced
ease
even
while
masked
and
submerged
to
set
the
probe
in
place
aiming
it
landward
at
the
check
point
of
the
finger
protruding
nail
of
rock
after
ashe
made
the
final
adjustments
tested
each
and
every
part
of
the
assembly
he
gestured
them
in
karara
swift
hand
movement
asked
a
question
and
ashe
sonic
in
reply
at
twilight
yes
dusk
was
the
proper
time
for
using
a
to
see
without
risk
of
being
sighted
in
return
was
their
safeguard
here
ashe
had
no
historical
data
to
guide
him
their
search
for
the
former
inhabitants
might
be
a
long
process
skipping
across
centuries
as
the
machine
was
adjusted
to
terran
time
eras
when
were
they
here
back
on
shore
karara
shook
out
her
hair
spread
it
over
her
shoulders
to
dry
how
many
hundred
years
back
will
the
probe
return
more
likely
thousands
ross
commented
where
will
you
start
gordon
ashe
brushed
sand
from
the
page
of
the
notebook
he
had
steadied
against
one
bent
knee
and
gazed
out
at
the
reef
where
they
had
set
the
probe
ten
thousand
years
why
karara
wanted
to
know
why
that
exact
figure
we
know
that
galactic
ships
crashed
on
terra
then
so
their
commerce
and
empire
if
it
was
an
empire
was
at
that
time
perhaps
they
were
at
the
zenith
of
their
civilization
perhaps
they
were
already
on
the
down
slope
i
do
not
think
they
were
near
the
beginning
so
that
date
is
as
good
a
starting
place
as
any
if
we
do
hit
what
after
then
we
can
move
forward
until
we
do
do
you
think
that
there
ever
was
a
native
population
here
might
have
been
but
without
any
large
land
animals
no
modern
traces
of
any
she
protested
of
people
ashe
shrugged
good
answers
for
both
suppose
there
was
a
epidemic
of
proportions
to
wipe
out
a
species
or
a
war
in
which
they
used
forces
beyond
our
comprehension
to
alter
the
whole
face
of
this
planet
which
did
happen
the
alteration
i
mean
several
things
could
have
removed
intelligent
life
then
such
species
as
the
burrowers
could
have
developed
or
evolved
from
smaller
more
primitive
types
those
we
found
on
the
desert
planet
ross
thought
back
to
their
first
voyage
on
the
homing
derelict
maybe
they
had
once
been
men
and
were
degenerating
and
the
winged
people
they
could
have
been
less
than
men
on
their
way
up
winged
people
karara
interrupted
tell
me
there
was
something
imperious
in
her
demand
but
ross
found
himself
describing
in
detail
their
past
adventures
first
on
the
world
of
sand
and
sealed
structures
where
the
derelict
had
rested
for
a
purpose
its
involuntary
passengers
had
never
understood
and
then
of
the
limited
exploration
of
that
other
planet
which
might
have
been
the
capital
world
of
a
stellar
empire
there
they
had
made
a
pact
with
a
winged
people
living
in
the
huge
buildings
of
a
city
but
you
see
the
polynesian
girl
turned
to
ashe
when
ross
had
finished
you
did
find
them
these
and
the
winged
people
but
here
there
are
only
the
dragons
and
the
burrowers
are
they
the
start
or
the
finish
i
want
to
know
why
ashe
asked
not
just
because
i
am
curious
though
i
am
that
also
but
because
we
too
must
have
a
beginning
and
an
end
did
we
come
up
from
the
seas
rise
to
know
and
feel
and
think
just
to
return
to
such
beginning
at
our
end
if
your
winged
people
were
climbing
and
your
descending
she
shook
her
head
it
would
be
frightening
to
hold
a
cord
of
life
both
ends
in
your
hands
is
it
good
for
us
to
see
such
things
gordon
men
have
asked
that
question
all
their
thinking
lives
karara
there
have
been
those
who
have
said
no
who
have
turned
aside
and
tried
to
halt
the
growth
of
knowledge
here
or
there
attempted
to
make
men
stand
still
on
one
tread
of
a
stairway
only
there
is
that
in
us
which
will
not
stop
as
we
may
be
for
the
climbing
perhaps
we
shall
be
safe
and
untroubled
here
on
hawaika
if
i
do
not
go
out
to
that
reef
tonight
by
that
action
i
may
bring
real
danger
down
on
all
of
us
yet
i
can
not
hold
back
for
that
could
you
no
i
do
not
believe
that
i
could
she
agreed
we
are
here
because
we
are
of
those
who
must
know
volunteers
and
being
of
that
temperament
it
is
in
us
always
to
take
the
next
step
even
if
it
leads
to
a
fall
she
added
in
a
low
tone
ashe
gazed
at
her
though
her
own
eyes
were
on
the
sea
where
a
lace
of
waves
marked
the
reef
her
words
were
ordinary
enough
but
ross
straightened
to
match
ashe
stare
why
had
he
felt
that
odd
instant
of
uneasiness
as
if
his
heart
had
fluttered
instead
of
beating
true
i
know
of
you
time
agents
karara
continued
there
were
plenty
of
stories
about
you
told
while
we
were
in
training
tall
tales
i
can
imagine
most
of
them
ashe
laughed
but
his
amusement
sounded
forced
to
ross
perhaps
though
i
do
not
believe
that
many
could
be
any
taller
than
the
truth
and
so
also
i
have
heard
of
that
strict
rule
you
follow
that
you
must
do
nothing
which
might
alter
the
course
of
history
but
suppose
suppose
here
that
the
course
of
history
could
be
altered
that
whatever
catastrophe
occurred
might
be
averted
if
that
was
done
what
would
happen
to
our
settlement
in
the
here
and
now
i
do
know
that
is
an
experiment
which
we
have
never
dared
to
try
which
we
wo
try
not
even
if
it
would
mean
a
chance
of
life
for
a
whole
native
race
she
persisted
alternate
worlds
then
maybe
ross
imagination
caught
up
that
idea
two
worlds
from
a
change
point
in
history
he
elaborated
noting
her
look
of
puzzlement
one
stemming
from
one
decision
another
from
the
alternate
i
heard
of
that
but
gordon
if
you
could
return
to
the
time
of
decision
here
and
you
had
it
in
your
power
to
say
live
or
die
to
the
alien
natives
what
would
you
do
i
do
know
but
neither
do
i
think
i
shall
ever
be
placed
in
that
position
why
do
you
ask
she
was
twisting
her
still
damp
hair
into
a
pony
tail
and
tying
it
so
with
a
cord
because
because
i
feel
no
i
can
not
really
put
it
into
words
gordon
it
is
that
feeling
one
has
on
the
eve
of
some
important
event
anticipation
fear
excitement
you
let
me
go
with
you
tonight
please
i
want
to
see
it
not
the
hawaika
that
is
but
that
other
world
with
another
name
the
one
they
saw
and
knew
an
instant
protest
was
hot
in
ross
throat
but
he
had
no
time
to
voice
it
for
ashe
was
already
nodding
all
right
but
we
may
have
no
luck
at
all
fishing
in
time
is
a
chancy
thing
so
do
be
disappointed
if
we
do
turn
you
up
that
other
world
now
i
going
to
pamper
these
old
bones
for
an
hour
or
two
amuse
yourselves
children
he
lay
back
and
closed
his
eyes
the
past
two
days
had
wiped
half
the
shadows
from
his
lean
tanned
face
he
had
dropped
two
years
three
ross
thought
thankfully
let
them
be
lucky
tonight
and
ashe
cure
could
be
nearly
complete
what
do
you
think
happened
here
karara
had
moved
so
that
her
back
was
now
to
the
wash
of
waves
her
face
more
in
the
shadow
how
do
i
know
could
be
any
of
ten
different
things
and
will
i
please
shut
up
and
leave
you
alone
she
countered
swiftly
do
you
wish
to
savor
the
excitement
then
explore
a
world
upon
world
or
am
i
saying
it
right
we
have
hawaika
one
which
is
a
new
world
for
us
now
there
is
hawaika
two
which
is
removed
in
time
not
distance
and
to
explore
that
we
wo
be
exploring
it
really
ross
protested
why
did
your
agents
not
spend
days
weeks
even
months
of
time
in
the
past
on
terra
what
is
to
prevent
your
doing
the
same
here
training
we
have
no
way
of
learning
the
drill
what
do
you
mean
well
it
was
as
easy
as
you
seem
to
think
it
was
back
on
terra
he
began
scornfully
we
did
just
stroll
through
one
of
those
gates
and
set
up
business
say
in
nero
rome
or
montezuma
mexico
an
agent
was
physically
and
psychologically
fitted
to
the
era
he
was
to
explore
then
he
trained
and
how
he
trained
ross
remembered
the
weary
hours
spent
learning
how
to
use
a
bronze
sword
the
technique
of
beaker
trading
the
hypnotic
instruction
in
a
language
which
was
already
dead
centuries
before
his
own
country
existed
you
learned
the
language
the
customs
everything
you
could
about
your
time
and
your
cover
you
were
letter
perfect
before
you
took
even
a
trial
run
and
here
you
would
have
no
guides
karara
said
nodding
yes
i
can
see
the
difficulty
then
you
will
just
use
the
probably
oh
maybe
later
on
we
can
scout
through
a
gate
we
have
the
material
to
set
one
up
but
it
would
be
a
strictly
limited
project
allowing
no
chance
of
being
caught
maybe
the
big
brains
back
home
can
take
and
work
out
some
basis
of
infiltration
for
us
from
it
but
that
would
take
years
i
suppose
so
only
you
begin
to
swim
in
the
shallows
do
you
not
by
jumping
off
a
cliff
she
laughed
true
enough
however
even
a
look
into
the
past
might
solve
part
of
the
big
mystery
ross
grunted
and
stretched
out
to
follow
ashe
example
but
behind
his
closed
eyes
his
brain
was
busy
and
he
did
not
cultivate
the
patience
he
needed
were
all
right
but
karara
had
a
point
you
wanted
more
than
a
small
window
into
a
mystery
you
wanted
a
part
in
solving
it
the
setting
of
the
sun
deepened
rose
to
red
made
a
dripping
banner
of
most
of
the
sky
so
that
under
it
they
moved
in
a
crimson
sea
looked
back
at
an
island
where
shadows
were
embers
instead
of
ashes
three
humans
two
dolphins
and
a
machine
mounted
on
a
reef
which
might
not
even
have
existed
in
the
time
they
sought
ashe
made
his
final
adjustments
and
then
his
finger
pressed
a
button
and
they
watched
the
no
larger
than
the
palms
of
two
hands
nothing
a
dull
gray
nothing
something
must
have
gone
wrong
with
their
assembly
work
ross
touched
ashe
shoulder
but
now
there
were
shadows
gathering
on
the
plate
thickening
to
sharpen
into
a
distinct
picture
it
was
still
the
sunset
hour
they
watched
but
somehow
the
colors
were
paler
less
red
and
sullen
than
the
ones
about
them
in
the
here
and
now
and
they
were
not
seeing
the
isle
toward
which
the
probe
had
been
aimed
they
were
looking
at
a
rugged
coastline
where
cliffs
lifted
well
above
the
while
on
those
cliffs
ross
had
not
realized
karara
had
reached
out
to
grasp
his
arm
until
her
nails
bit
into
his
flesh
and
even
then
he
was
hardly
aware
of
the
pain
because
there
was
a
building
on
the
cliff
massive
walls
of
native
rock
reared
in
outward
defenses
culminating
in
towers
and
from
the
high
point
of
one
tower
the
pointed
tail
of
a
banner
cracked
in
the
wind
there
was
a
headland
of
rock
reaching
out
not
toward
them
but
to
the
north
and
rounding
that
war
canoe
karara
exclaimed
but
ross
had
another
identification
longboat
in
reality
the
vessel
was
neither
one
nor
the
other
not
the
double
canoe
of
the
pacific
which
had
transported
warriors
on
raid
from
one
island
to
another
or
the
warship
of
the
vikings
but
the
terrans
were
right
in
its
purpose
that
rakish
ship
had
been
fashioned
for
swift
passage
of
the
seas
for
maneuverability
as
a
weapon
behind
the
first
nosed
another
and
a
third
their
sails
were
dyed
by
the
sun
but
there
were
devices
painted
on
them
and
the
lines
of
those
designs
glittered
as
if
they
had
been
drawn
with
a
metallic
fluid
the
castle
ashe
cry
pulled
their
attention
back
to
land
there
was
movement
along
those
walls
then
came
a
flash
a
splash
in
the
water
close
enough
to
the
lead
ship
to
wet
her
deck
with
spray
they
fighting
karara
shouldered
against
ross
for
a
better
look
the
ships
were
altering
course
swinging
away
from
land
out
to
sea
moving
too
fast
for
sails
alone
and
i
do
see
any
oars
ross
was
puzzled
how
do
you
suppose
the
bombardment
from
the
castle
continued
but
did
not
score
any
hits
already
the
ships
were
out
of
range
the
lead
vessel
off
the
screen
of
the
peep
as
well
then
there
was
just
the
castle
in
the
sunset
ashe
straightened
up
rocks
he
repeated
wonderingly
they
were
throwing
rocks
but
those
ships
they
must
have
had
engines
they
were
just
depending
on
sails
when
they
retreated
ross
added
his
own
cause
for
bewilderment
karara
looked
from
one
to
the
other
there
is
something
here
you
do
not
understand
what
is
wrong
catapults
yes
ashe
said
with
a
nod
those
would
fit
periods
corresponding
from
the
roman
empire
into
the
middle
ages
but
right
ross
those
ships
had
power
of
some
kind
to
take
them
offshore
that
quickly
a
technically
advanced
race
coming
up
against
a
more
backward
one
hazarded
the
younger
man
could
be
let
go
forward
some
the
incoming
tide
was
washing
well
up
on
the
reef
ashe
had
to
don
his
mask
as
he
plunged
head
and
shoulders
under
water
to
make
the
necessary
adjustment
once
more
he
pressed
the
button
and
ross
gasp
was
echoed
by
one
from
the
girl
the
cliff
again
but
there
was
no
castle
dominating
it
only
a
ruin
hardly
more
than
rubble
now
above
the
sites
of
the
saucer
depressions
great
pylons
of
silvery
metal
warmed
into
fire
brilliance
by
the
sunset
raked
into
the
sky
like
gaunt
skeleton
fingers
there
were
no
ships
no
signs
of
any
life
even
the
vegetation
which
had
showed
on
shore
had
vanished
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
stark
abandonment
and
death
which
struck
the
terrans
forcibly
those
pylons
ross
studied
them
something
familiar
in
their
construction
teased
his
memory
that
refuel
planet
where
the
derelict
ship
had
set
down
twice
on
the
voyage
out
and
on
their
return
that
had
been
a
world
of
metal
structures
and
he
believed
he
could
trace
a
kinship
between
his
memory
of
those
and
these
pylons
surely
they
had
no
connection
with
the
earlier
castle
on
the
cliff
once
more
ashe
ducked
to
reset
the
probe
and
in
the
light
they
watched
a
third
and
last
picture
but
now
they
might
have
been
looking
at
the
island
of
the
present
save
that
it
bore
no
vegetation
and
there
was
a
rawness
about
it
a
sharpness
of
rock
outline
now
vanished
those
pylons
were
they
the
key
to
the
change
which
had
come
upon
this
world
what
were
they
who
had
set
them
there
for
the
last
ross
thought
he
had
an
answer
they
were
certainly
the
product
of
the
galactic
empire
and
the
castle
the
ships
natives
settlers
two
widely
different
eras
and
the
mystery
still
lay
between
them
would
they
ever
be
able
to
bring
the
key
to
it
out
of
time
they
swam
for
the
shore
where
ui
had
a
fire
blazing
and
their
supper
prepared
how
many
years
lying
between
those
probes
ross
pulled
broiled
fish
apart
with
his
fingers
that
first
was
ten
thousand
years
ago
the
second
ashe
paused
only
two
hundred
years
later
but
ross
stared
at
his
superior
that
means
that
there
was
a
war
or
some
drastic
form
of
invasion
yes
you
mean
that
the
star
people
arrived
and
just
took
over
this
whole
planet
karara
asked
but
why
and
those
pylons
what
were
they
for
how
much
later
was
that
last
picture
five
hundred
years
the
pylons
were
gone
too
then
ross
commented
but
why
he
echoed
karara
question
ashe
had
taken
up
his
notebook
but
he
did
not
open
it
i
think
there
was
a
sharp
grim
note
in
his
voice
we
had
better
find
out
put
up
a
gate
ashe
broke
all
the
previous
rules
of
their
service
with
his
answer
yes
a
gate
storm
menace
we
have
to
know
ashe
leaned
back
against
the
crate
they
had
just
emptied
something
was
done
here
in
two
hundred
years
and
then
an
empty
world
pandora
box
ross
drew
a
hand
across
his
forehead
smearing
sweat
and
fine
sand
into
a
brand
ashe
nodded
maybe
we
run
that
risk
loosing
all
the
devils
of
the
aliens
but
what
if
the
reds
open
the
box
first
on
one
of
their
settlement
worlds
there
it
was
again
the
old
thorn
which
prodded
them
into
risks
and
recklessness
danger
ahead
on
both
paths
do
risk
trying
to
learn
galactic
secrets
but
do
risk
your
enemy
learning
them
either
you
held
a
iron
in
both
hands
in
this
business
and
ashe
was
right
they
had
stumbled
on
something
here
which
hinted
that
a
whole
world
had
been
altered
to
suit
some
plan
suppose
the
secret
of
that
alteration
was
discovered
by
their
enemies
were
the
ship
and
castle
people
natives
ross
wondered
aloud
just
at
a
guess
they
were
or
at
least
settlers
who
had
been
established
here
so
long
they
had
developed
a
local
form
of
civilization
which
was
about
on
the
level
of
a
feudal
society
you
mean
because
of
the
castle
and
the
rock
bombardment
but
what
about
the
ships
two
separate
phases
of
a
society
at
war
perhaps
a
more
progressive
against
a
less
technically
advanced
american
warships
paying
a
visit
to
the
shogun
japan
for
example
ross
grinned
those
warships
did
seem
to
fancy
their
welcome
they
steered
out
to
sea
fast
enough
when
the
rocks
began
to
fall
yes
but
the
ships
could
exist
in
the
castle
pattern
the
pylons
could
not
which
period
are
you
aiming
for
first
the
castle
or
the
pylons
castle
first
i
think
then
if
we
ca
pick
up
any
hints
we
take
some
jumps
forward
until
we
do
connect
only
we
be
under
severe
handicaps
if
we
could
only
plant
an
analyzer
somewhere
in
the
castle
as
a
beginning
ross
did
not
show
his
surprise
if
ashe
was
talking
on
those
terms
then
he
was
intending
to
do
more
than
just
lurk
around
a
little
beyond
the
gate
he
was
really
planning
to
pick
up
alien
speech
patterns
eventually
assume
an
alien
agent
identity
gordon
karara
appeared
between
two
of
the
lace
trees
she
came
so
hastily
that
the
contents
of
the
two
cups
she
carried
slopped
over
you
must
hear
what
hori
has
to
say
the
tall
samoan
who
trailed
her
spoke
quickly
for
the
first
time
since
ross
had
known
him
he
was
very
serious
a
frown
line
between
his
eyes
there
is
a
bad
storm
coming
our
instruments
register
it
how
long
away
ashe
was
on
his
feet
a
day
maybe
two
ross
could
see
no
change
in
the
sky
islands
or
sea
they
had
had
idyllic
weather
for
the
six
weeks
since
their
planeting
no
sign
of
any
such
trouble
in
the
hawaikan
paradise
it
coming
hori
repeated
the
gate
is
half
up
ashe
thought
aloud
too
much
of
it
set
to
be
dismantled
again
in
a
hurry
if
it
completed
hori
wanted
to
know
would
it
ride
out
a
storm
it
might
behind
that
reef
where
we
have
it
based
to
finish
it
would
be
a
fast
job
hori
flexed
his
hands
we
more
brawn
than
brain
in
these
matters
gordon
but
you
all
our
help
for
what
it
worth
what
about
the
ship
does
it
lift
on
schedule
check
with
rimbault
about
that
this
storm
how
will
it
compare
to
a
pacific
typhoon
the
samoan
shook
his
head
how
do
we
know
we
have
not
yet
had
to
face
the
local
variety
the
islands
are
low
karara
commented
winds
and
water
could
yes
we
better
see
rimbault
about
a
shelter
if
needed
if
the
settlement
had
drowsed
now
its
inhabitants
were
busy
it
was
decided
that
they
could
shelter
in
the
spaceship
should
the
storm
reach
hurricane
proportions
but
before
its
coming
the
gate
must
be
finished
the
final
fitting
was
left
to
ashe
and
ross
and
the
older
agent
fastened
the
last
bolt
when
the
waters
beyond
the
reef
were
already
wind
ruffled
the
sky
darkening
fast
the
dolphins
swam
back
and
forth
in
the
lagoon
and
with
them
karara
though
ashe
had
twice
waved
her
to
the
shore
there
was
no
sunlight
left
and
they
worked
with
torches
ashe
began
his
inspection
of
the
relatively
simple
transfer
the
two
upright
bars
the
slab
of
opaque
material
forming
a
doorstep
between
them
this
was
only
a
skeleton
of
the
gates
ross
had
used
in
the
past
but
continual
experimentation
had
produced
this
more
easily
transported
installation
piled
in
a
net
were
several
supply
containers
ready
for
an
exploring
run
extra
the
analyzer
emergency
rations
a
medical
kit
all
the
basics
was
ashe
going
to
try
now
he
had
activated
the
transfer
the
rods
were
glowing
faintly
the
slab
they
guarded
having
an
eerie
blue
glimmer
he
probably
only
wanted
to
be
sure
it
worked
what
happened
at
that
moment
ross
could
never
find
any
adequate
words
to
describe
nor
was
he
sure
he
could
remember
the
disorientation
of
the
he
had
experienced
before
this
time
he
was
whirled
into
a
vortex
of
feeling
in
which
his
body
his
identity
were
rift
from
him
and
he
lost
touch
with
all
stability
instinctively
he
lashed
out
his
reflexes
more
than
his
conscious
will
keeping
him
above
water
in
the
wild
rage
of
a
sea
the
light
was
gone
here
was
only
dark
and
beating
water
then
a
lightning
flash
ripped
wide
the
heavens
over
ross
as
his
head
broke
the
surface
and
he
saw
with
unbelieving
eyes
that
he
was
being
thrust
shoreward
not
to
the
strand
of
finger
island
but
against
a
cliff
where
water
pounded
an
unyielding
wall
of
rock
ross
comprehended
that
somehow
he
had
been
jerked
through
the
gate
that
he
was
now
fronting
the
land
that
had
been
somewhere
beneath
the
heights
supporting
the
castle
then
he
fought
for
his
life
to
escape
the
hammer
of
the
sea
determined
to
crack
him
against
the
surface
of
the
cliff
a
rough
surface
loomed
up
before
him
and
he
threw
himself
in
that
direction
embracing
a
rock
striving
to
cling
through
the
backwash
of
the
wave
which
had
brought
him
there
his
nails
grated
and
broke
on
the
stone
and
then
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
caught
in
a
hole
and
he
held
with
all
the
strength
in
his
gasping
beaten
body
he
had
had
no
preparation
no
warning
and
only
the
tough
survival
will
which
had
been
trained
and
bred
into
him
saved
his
life
as
the
water
washed
back
ross
strove
to
pull
up
farther
on
his
anchorage
to
be
above
the
strike
of
the
next
wave
somehow
he
gained
a
foot
before
it
came
the
mask
of
the
saved
him
from
being
smothered
in
that
curling
torrent
as
he
clung
stubbornly
resisting
again
the
pull
of
the
retreating
sea
inch
by
inch
between
waves
he
fought
for
footing
and
stable
support
then
he
was
on
the
surface
of
the
rock
out
of
all
but
the
lash
of
spray
he
crouched
there
spent
and
gasping
the
thunder
roar
of
the
surf
and
beyond
it
the
deeper
mutter
of
the
rage
in
the
heavens
was
deafening
dulling
his
sense
as
much
as
the
ordeal
through
which
he
had
passed
he
was
content
to
cling
where
he
was
hardly
conscious
of
his
surroundings
sparks
of
light
along
the
shore
to
the
north
at
last
caught
attention
they
moved
some
clustering
along
the
wave
line
a
few
strung
up
the
cliff
and
they
were
not
part
of
the
storm
fireworks
men
here
why
at
this
moment
another
bolt
of
lightning
showed
him
the
answer
on
the
reef
fringe
which
ran
a
tongue
of
land
into
the
sea
hung
a
ship
two
ships
pounded
by
every
hammer
wave
shipwrecks
and
those
lights
must
mark
castle
dwellers
drawn
to
aid
the
survivors
ross
crawled
across
his
rock
on
his
hands
and
knees
wavered
along
the
cliff
wall
until
he
was
again
faced
with
angry
water
to
drop
into
that
would
be
a
mistake
he
hesitated
and
now
more
than
his
own
predicament
struck
home
to
him
ashe
ashe
had
been
ahead
of
him
at
the
time
gate
if
ross
had
been
jerked
through
to
this
past
then
somewhere
in
the
water
on
the
shore
gordon
was
here
too
but
where
to
find
him
setting
his
back
to
the
cliff
and
holding
to
the
rough
stone
ross
got
to
his
feet
trying
to
see
through
the
welter
of
foam
and
water
not
only
the
sea
poured
here
now
a
torrential
rain
fell
into
the
bargain
streaming
down
about
him
battering
his
head
and
shoulders
a
chill
rain
which
made
him
shiver
he
wore
weighted
belt
with
its
sheathed
tool
and
knife
flippers
and
the
pair
of
swimming
trunks
which
had
been
suitable
for
the
hawaika
he
knew
but
this
was
a
different
world
altogether
dare
he
use
his
torch
to
see
the
way
out
of
here
ross
watched
the
lights
to
the
north
deciding
they
were
not
too
unlike
his
own
beam
and
took
the
chance
now
he
stood
on
a
shelf
of
rock
pitted
with
depressions
all
pools
to
his
left
was
a
drop
into
a
boiling
whirling
caldron
from
which
points
of
stone
fanged
ross
shuddered
at
least
he
had
escaped
being
pulled
into
that
to
his
right
northward
there
was
another
space
of
sea
a
narrow
strip
and
then
a
second
ledge
he
measured
the
distance
between
that
and
the
one
on
which
he
perched
staying
where
he
was
would
not
locate
ashe
ross
stripped
off
his
flippers
made
them
fast
in
his
belt
then
he
leaped
and
landed
painfully
as
his
feet
slipped
and
he
skidded
face
down
on
the
northern
ledge
as
he
sat
up
rubbing
a
bruised
and
scraped
knee
he
saw
lights
advancing
in
his
direction
and
between
them
a
shadow
crawling
from
water
to
shore
ross
stumbled
along
the
ledge
hastening
to
reach
that
figure
who
lay
still
now
just
out
of
the
waves
ashe
ross
limping
pace
became
a
trot
but
he
was
too
late
the
other
lights
two
of
them
had
reached
the
shadow
a
man
or
at
least
a
body
which
was
humanoid
sprawled
face
down
other
men
three
of
them
gathered
over
the
exhausted
swimmer
those
who
held
the
torches
were
still
partially
in
the
dark
but
the
third
stooped
to
roll
over
their
find
ross
caught
the
glint
of
light
on
a
metallic
headcovering
the
glisten
of
wet
armor
of
some
type
on
the
fellow
back
and
shoulders
as
he
made
quick
examination
of
the
victim
then
ross
halted
his
eyes
wide
a
hand
rose
and
fell
with
expert
precision
there
had
been
a
blade
in
that
hand
already
the
three
were
turning
away
from
the
man
so
ruthlessly
dispatched
ashe
or
some
survivor
of
the
wrecked
ships
ross
retreated
to
the
end
of
the
ledge
the
narrow
stream
of
water
dividing
it
from
the
rock
where
he
had
won
ashore
washed
into
a
cave
in
the
cliff
dare
he
try
to
work
his
way
into
that
masked
with
the
he
could
go
under
surface
if
he
were
not
smashed
by
the
waves
against
some
wall
he
glanced
back
the
lights
were
very
close
to
the
end
of
his
ledge
to
withdraw
to
the
second
rock
would
mean
being
caught
in
a
dead
end
for
he
dared
not
enter
the
whirlpool
on
its
far
side
there
was
really
no
choice
stay
and
be
killed
or
try
for
the
cave
ross
fastened
on
his
flippers
and
lowered
his
body
into
the
narrow
stream
the
fact
that
it
was
narrow
and
guarded
on
either
side
by
the
ledges
tamed
the
waves
a
little
and
ross
found
the
tug
against
him
not
so
great
as
he
feared
it
would
be
keeping
on
the
rock
he
worked
along
head
and
shoulders
often
under
the
wash
of
rolling
water
but
winning
steadily
to
the
break
in
the
cliff
wall
then
he
was
through
into
a
space
much
larger
than
the
opening
but
not
with
a
wild
turbulence
of
waves
had
he
been
sighted
ross
kept
a
handhold
to
the
left
of
that
narrow
entrance
his
body
floating
with
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
water
he
could
make
out
the
gleam
of
light
without
it
might
be
that
one
of
those
hunters
had
leaned
out
over
the
runnel
of
the
cave
entrance
was
flashing
his
torch
down
into
the
water
there
behind
mask
plate
ross
lips
writhed
in
the
snarl
of
the
hunted
in
here
he
would
have
the
advantage
let
one
of
them
or
all
three
try
to
follow
through
that
rock
entrance
and
but
if
he
had
been
sighted
at
the
mouth
of
the
lair
none
of
his
trackers
appeared
to
wish
to
press
the
hunt
the
light
disappeared
and
ross
was
left
in
the
dark
he
counted
a
hundred
slowly
and
then
a
second
hundred
before
he
dared
use
his
own
torch
for
all
its
slit
entrance
this
was
a
hideaway
he
had
chanced
upon
and
he
discovered
when
he
ventured
to
release
his
wall
hold
and
swim
out
into
its
middle
the
bottom
arose
in
a
slope
toward
its
rear
moments
later
ross
pulled
out
of
the
water
once
more
to
crouch
shivering
on
a
ledge
only
lapped
now
and
then
by
wavelets
he
had
found
a
temporary
refuge
but
his
good
fortune
did
not
quiet
his
fears
had
that
been
ashe
on
the
shore
and
why
had
the
swimmer
been
so
summarily
executed
by
the
men
who
found
him
the
ships
caught
on
the
reef
the
castle
on
the
cliff
above
his
head
enemies
ships
crews
and
castle
men
but
the
callous
act
of
the
shore
patrol
argued
a
state
of
war
carried
to
fanatic
proportions
perhaps
conflict
he
could
not
hope
to
explore
until
the
storm
was
over
to
plunge
back
into
the
sea
would
not
find
ashe
and
to
be
hunted
along
the
shore
by
an
unknown
enemy
was
simply
asking
to
die
without
achieving
any
good
in
return
no
he
must
remain
where
he
was
for
the
present
ross
unhooked
the
torch
from
his
belt
and
used
it
on
this
higher
portion
of
the
cave
he
was
perched
on
a
ledge
which
protruded
into
the
water
in
the
form
of
a
wedge
at
his
back
the
wall
of
the
cave
was
rough
and
trails
of
weed
were
festooned
on
its
projections
the
smell
of
fishy
decay
was
strong
enough
to
register
as
ross
pulled
off
his
mask
as
far
as
he
could
now
see
there
was
no
exit
except
by
sea
a
movement
in
the
water
brought
his
light
flashing
down
into
the
dark
flood
then
a
sleek
head
arose
in
the
path
of
that
ray
not
a
man
swimming
but
one
of
the
dolphins
ross
exclamation
of
surprise
was
half
gasp
half
cry
the
second
dolphin
showed
for
a
moment
and
between
the
shadow
of
their
bodies
just
under
the
surface
moved
a
third
form
ashe
ross
had
no
idea
how
the
dolphins
had
come
through
the
time
gate
but
that
they
had
guided
to
safety
a
terran
he
did
not
doubt
at
all
ashe
but
it
was
not
ashe
who
came
wading
to
the
ledge
where
ross
waited
with
hand
outstretched
he
had
been
so
sure
of
the
other
identity
that
he
blinked
in
complete
bewilderment
as
his
eyes
met
karara
and
she
half
stumbled
half
reeled
against
him
his
arms
about
her
shoulders
steadied
her
and
her
shivering
body
was
close
to
his
as
she
leaned
her
full
weight
upon
him
her
hands
made
a
feeble
movement
to
her
mask
and
he
pulled
it
off
uncovered
her
face
was
pale
and
drawn
her
eyes
now
closed
and
her
breath
came
in
ragged
tearing
sobs
which
shook
her
even
more
how
did
you
get
here
ross
demanded
even
as
he
pushed
her
down
on
the
ledge
her
head
moved
slowly
in
a
weak
gesture
of
negation
i
do
know
we
were
close
to
the
gate
there
was
a
flash
of
light
then
her
voice
sealed
up
with
a
note
of
hysteria
in
it
then
i
was
here
and
taua
with
me
came
ross
ross
there
was
a
man
swimming
he
got
ashore
he
was
getting
to
his
feet
and
and
they
killed
him
ross
hold
tightened
he
stared
into
her
face
with
fierce
demand
was
it
gordon
she
blinked
brought
her
hand
up
to
her
mouth
and
wiped
it
back
and
forth
across
her
chin
there
was
a
small
red
trickle
growing
between
her
fingers
dripping
down
her
arm
gordon
she
repeated
it
as
if
she
had
never
heard
the
name
before
yes
did
they
kill
gordon
in
his
grasp
she
was
swaying
back
and
forth
then
realizing
he
was
shaking
her
ross
got
himself
under
control
but
a
measure
of
understanding
had
come
into
her
eyes
no
not
gordon
where
is
gordon
you
have
seen
him
ross
persisted
knowing
it
was
useless
not
since
we
were
at
the
gate
her
words
were
less
slurred
you
with
him
no
i
was
alone
ross
where
are
we
better
say
when
are
we
he
replied
we
through
the
gate
and
back
in
time
and
we
have
to
find
gordon
he
did
not
want
to
think
of
what
might
have
happened
out
on
the
shore
time
wrecked
can
we
go
back
karara
was
herself
again
her
voice
crisp
i
do
know
ross
gave
her
the
truth
the
force
which
had
drawn
them
through
the
gate
was
beyond
his
experience
as
far
as
he
knew
there
had
never
been
such
an
involuntary
passage
by
time
gate
and
what
their
trip
might
mean
he
did
not
know
the
main
concern
was
that
ashe
must
have
come
through
too
and
that
he
was
missing
just
let
the
storm
abate
and
with
the
dolphins
aid
ross
chance
for
finding
the
missing
agent
was
immeasurably
better
he
said
so
now
and
karara
nodded
do
you
suppose
there
is
a
war
going
on
here
she
hugged
her
arms
across
her
breast
her
shoulders
heaving
in
the
torch
light
with
shudders
she
could
not
control
the
damp
chill
was
biting
and
ross
realized
that
was
also
danger
could
be
he
got
to
his
feet
switched
the
light
from
the
girl
to
the
walls
that
seaweed
could
it
make
them
some
form
of
protective
covering
hold
this
aim
it
there
he
thrust
the
torch
into
her
hands
and
went
for
one
of
the
loops
of
kelp
ross
reeled
in
lines
of
the
stuff
it
was
but
only
slightly
damp
and
he
piled
it
on
the
ledge
in
a
kind
of
nest
at
least
in
the
hollow
of
that
mound
they
would
be
sheltered
after
a
fashion
karara
crawled
into
the
center
of
the
mass
and
ross
followed
her
the
smell
of
the
stuff
filled
his
nose
was
almost
like
a
visible
cloud
but
he
had
been
right
the
girl
stopped
shivering
and
he
felt
a
measure
of
warmth
in
his
own
shaking
body
ross
snapped
off
the
torch
and
they
lay
together
in
the
dark
the
pile
of
weed
holding
them
he
must
have
slept
ross
guessed
when
he
stirred
raising
his
head
his
body
was
stiff
aching
as
he
braced
himself
up
on
his
hands
and
peered
over
the
edge
of
their
kelp
nest
there
was
light
in
the
cave
a
pale
grayish
wash
which
grew
stronger
toward
the
slit
opening
it
must
be
day
and
that
meant
they
could
move
ross
groped
in
the
weed
his
hand
falling
on
a
curve
of
shoulder
wake
up
his
voice
was
hoarse
and
held
the
snap
of
an
order
there
was
a
startled
gasp
in
answer
and
the
mound
beside
him
heaved
as
the
girl
stirred
day
out
ross
pointed
and
the
storm
she
stood
up
i
think
it
is
over
it
was
true
that
the
level
of
water
within
the
cave
had
fallen
that
wavelets
no
longer
lapped
with
the
same
vigor
morning
the
storm
over
and
somewhere
ashe
ross
was
about
to
snap
his
mask
into
place
when
karara
caught
at
his
arm
be
careful
remember
what
i
saw
last
night
they
were
killing
swimmers
he
shook
her
off
impatiently
i
no
fool
and
with
the
packs
on
we
do
not
have
to
surface
listen
he
had
another
thought
one
which
would
provide
an
excellent
excuse
for
keeping
her
safely
out
of
his
company
reducing
his
responsibility
for
her
you
take
the
dolphins
and
try
to
find
the
gate
we
want
out
as
soon
as
i
locate
ashe
and
if
you
do
not
find
him
soon
ross
hesitated
she
had
not
said
the
rest
what
if
he
could
not
find
gordon
at
all
but
he
would
he
had
to
i
be
back
here
he
checked
his
watch
no
longer
an
accurate
timekeeper
for
hawaikan
days
held
an
hour
more
than
the
terran
but
the
settlers
kept
the
measurement
to
check
on
work
periods
in
say
two
hours
you
should
know
by
then
about
the
gate
and
i
have
some
idea
of
the
situation
along
the
shore
but
listen
ross
caught
her
shoulders
in
a
taut
grip
pulled
her
around
to
face
him
his
eyes
hot
and
almost
angry
as
they
held
hers
do
let
yourself
be
seen
he
repeated
the
cardinal
rule
of
agents
in
new
territory
we
do
dare
risk
discovery
karara
nodded
and
he
could
see
that
she
understood
was
aware
of
the
importance
of
that
warning
do
you
want
or
taua
no
i
going
to
search
along
the
shore
first
ashe
would
have
tried
for
that
last
night
was
probably
driven
in
the
way
we
were
he
go
to
ground
somewhere
and
i
have
this
ross
touched
the
sonic
on
his
belt
i
set
it
on
his
call
you
do
the
same
with
yours
then
if
we
get
within
distance
he
pick
us
up
back
here
in
two
hours
yes
karara
kicked
free
of
the
weed
was
already
wading
down
to
where
the
dolphins
circled
in
the
cave
pool
waiting
for
her
ross
followed
and
the
four
swam
for
the
open
sea
it
could
not
be
much
after
dawn
ross
thought
as
he
clung
by
one
hand
to
a
rock
and
watched
karara
and
the
dolphins
on
their
way
then
he
paddled
along
the
shore
northward
for
his
own
survey
of
the
coast
there
was
a
rose
cast
in
the
sky
warming
the
silver
along
the
far
reaches
of
the
horizon
and
about
him
bobbed
storm
flotsam
so
that
he
had
to
pick
a
careful
way
through
floating
debris
on
the
reef
one
of
the
wrecked
ships
had
vanished
entirely
perhaps
it
had
been
battered
to
death
by
the
waves
ground
to
splinters
against
the
rocks
the
other
still
held
its
prow
well
out
of
the
now
receding
waves
jagged
holes
in
its
sides
through
which
spurts
of
water
cascaded
now
and
then
the
wreck
which
had
been
driven
landward
was
composed
of
planks
boxes
and
containers
rolled
by
the
waves
force
much
of
this
was
already
free
of
the
sea
and
on
the
beach
figures
moved
examining
it
in
spite
of
the
danger
of
chance
discovery
ross
edged
along
rocks
seeking
a
vantage
point
from
which
he
could
watch
that
activity
he
was
flat
against
a
boulder
a
swell
of
floating
weed
draped
about
him
when
the
nearest
of
the
foraging
parties
moved
into
good
view
men
at
least
they
had
the
outward
appearance
of
men
much
like
himself
though
their
skin
was
dark
and
their
limbs
appeared
disproportionately
long
and
thin
there
were
two
groups
of
them
four
wearing
only
a
scanty
loincloth
busy
turning
over
and
hunting
through
the
debris
under
the
direction
of
the
other
two
the
workers
had
thick
growths
of
hair
which
not
only
covered
their
heads
but
down
their
spines
and
the
outer
sides
of
their
thin
arms
and
legs
to
elbow
and
knee
the
hair
was
a
pallid
in
vivid
contrast
to
their
dark
skins
and
their
chins
protruded
sharply
allowing
the
lower
line
of
their
faces
to
take
on
a
vaguely
disturbing
likeness
to
an
animal
muzzle
their
overseers
were
more
fully
clothed
wearing
not
only
helmets
on
their
heads
whose
helms
had
a
protective
visor
over
the
face
but
also
and
molded
to
their
bodies
ross
thought
that
these
could
not
be
solid
metal
since
they
adapted
to
the
movements
of
the
wearers
feet
and
legs
were
covered
with
casing
combinations
of
shoe
and
leggings
colored
dull
red
they
were
armed
with
swords
of
an
odd
pattern
their
points
curved
up
so
that
the
blade
resembled
a
fishhook
unsheathed
the
blades
were
clipped
to
a
waist
belt
by
catches
which
glittered
in
the
weak
morning
light
as
if
gem
set
ross
could
see
little
of
their
faces
for
the
beak
visors
overhung
their
features
but
their
skins
were
as
dusky
as
those
of
the
laborers
and
their
arms
and
legs
of
the
same
unusual
length
men
of
the
same
race
he
deduced
under
the
orders
of
the
armed
overseers
the
laborers
were
reducing
the
beach
to
order
sorting
out
the
flotsam
into
two
piles
once
they
gathered
about
a
find
and
the
sound
of
excited
speech
reached
ross
as
an
agitated
clicking
the
armored
men
came
up
surveyed
the
discovery
one
of
them
shrugged
and
clicked
an
order
ross
caught
only
a
half
glimpse
of
the
thing
two
of
the
workers
dragged
away
a
body
ashe
the
terran
was
about
to
move
closer
when
he
saw
the
green
cloak
dragging
about
the
corpse
no
not
gordon
just
another
victim
from
the
wrecks
the
aliens
were
working
their
way
toward
ross
and
perhaps
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
he
was
pushing
aside
his
curtain
of
weed
when
he
was
startled
by
a
shout
for
a
second
he
thought
he
might
have
been
sighted
until
resulting
action
on
shore
told
him
otherwise
the
furred
workers
shrank
back
against
the
mound
to
which
they
had
just
dragged
the
body
while
the
two
guards
took
up
a
position
before
them
curved
swords
snapped
from
their
belt
hooks
ready
in
their
hands
again
that
shout
was
it
a
warning
or
a
threat
with
the
language
barrier
ross
could
only
wait
to
see
another
party
approached
along
the
beach
from
the
south
in
the
lead
was
a
cloaked
and
hooded
figure
so
muffled
in
its
covering
of
that
ross
had
no
idea
of
the
form
beneath
no
now
that
hue
was
deepening
with
blue
tones
darkening
rapidly
by
the
time
the
cloaked
newcomer
had
passed
the
rock
which
sheltered
the
terran
the
covering
was
a
rich
blue
which
seemed
to
glow
behind
the
leader
were
a
dozen
armed
men
they
wore
the
same
beaked
helmets
the
supple
encasing
and
but
their
leggings
were
gray
they
too
carried
curved
swords
but
the
weapons
were
still
latched
to
their
belts
and
they
made
no
move
to
draw
them
in
spite
of
the
very
patent
hostility
of
the
guards
before
them
blue
cloak
halted
some
three
feet
from
the
guards
the
sea
wind
pulled
at
the
cloak
wrapping
it
about
the
body
beneath
but
even
so
the
wearer
remained
well
hidden
from
under
a
flapping
edge
came
a
hand
the
fingers
long
and
slender
were
curled
about
an
wand
which
ended
in
a
knob
sparks
flashed
from
it
in
a
continuous
flickering
ross
clapped
his
hand
to
his
belt
to
his
complete
amazement
the
sonic
disk
he
wore
was
reacting
to
those
flashes
pricking
sharply
in
perfect
beat
to
their
the
terran
cupped
his
scarred
fingers
over
the
disk
as
he
waited
to
see
what
was
going
to
happen
wondering
if
the
holder
of
that
wand
might
in
return
pick
up
the
broadcast
of
the
code
set
on
ashe
call
the
hand
clasping
the
wand
was
not
but
had
much
of
the
same
ivory
shade
as
the
rod
so
that
to
ross
the
meeting
between
flesh
and
wand
was
hardly
distinguishable
now
by
one
firm
thrust
the
hand
planted
the
rod
into
the
sand
leaving
it
to
stand
sentinel
between
the
two
parties
retreating
a
step
or
two
the
guards
gave
ground
but
they
did
not
reclasp
their
swords
their
attitude
ross
judged
was
that
of
men
in
some
awe
of
their
opponent
but
men
urged
to
defiance
either
by
a
belief
in
the
righteousness
of
their
cause
or
strengthened
by
an
old
hatred
now
the
cloaked
one
began
to
speak
or
was
that
speech
certainly
the
flow
of
sound
had
little
in
common
with
the
clicking
tongue
ross
had
caught
earlier
this
trill
of
notes
possessed
the
rise
and
fall
of
a
chant
or
song
which
could
have
been
a
formula
of
greeting
or
a
warning
and
the
lines
of
warriors
escorting
the
chanter
stood
to
attention
their
weapons
still
undrawn
ross
caught
his
lower
lip
between
his
teeth
and
bit
down
on
it
that
chanting
it
crawled
into
the
mind
set
up
a
pattern
he
shook
his
head
vigorously
and
then
was
shocked
by
that
recklessness
not
that
any
of
those
on
shore
had
glanced
in
his
direction
the
chant
ended
on
a
high
broken
note
it
was
followed
by
a
moment
of
silence
through
which
sounded
only
the
wind
and
the
beat
of
wave
then
one
of
the
laborers
flung
up
his
head
and
clicked
a
word
or
two
he
and
his
fellows
fell
face
down
on
the
beach
cupping
their
hands
to
pour
sand
over
their
unkempt
heads
one
of
the
guards
turned
with
a
sharp
yell
to
boot
the
nearest
of
the
workers
in
the
ribs
but
his
companion
cried
out
the
wand
which
had
stood
so
erect
when
it
was
first
planted
now
inclined
toward
the
working
party
its
sparks
shooting
so
swiftly
and
with
such
slight
break
between
that
they
were
fast
making
a
single
beam
ross
jerked
his
hand
from
contact
with
the
sonic
a
distinct
throb
of
pain
answered
that
stepping
up
of
the
mysterious
broadcast
the
laborers
broke
and
ran
or
rather
crawled
on
their
bellies
until
they
were
well
away
before
they
got
to
their
feet
and
pelted
back
down
the
strand
however
the
guards
were
of
sterner
stuff
they
were
withdrawing
all
right
but
slowly
backing
away
their
swords
held
up
before
them
as
men
might
retreat
before
insurmountable
odds
when
they
were
well
gone
the
robed
one
took
up
the
wand
holding
it
out
beyond
the
cloaked
leader
of
the
second
party
approached
the
two
piles
of
salvage
the
workers
had
heaped
into
rough
order
there
was
a
detailed
inspection
of
both
until
the
robed
one
came
upon
the
body
at
a
trilled
order
two
of
the
warriors
came
up
and
laid
out
the
corpse
when
the
robed
one
nodded
they
stood
well
back
the
rod
moved
the
tip
rather
than
the
knobbed
head
being
pointed
at
the
body
ross
head
snapped
back
that
bolt
of
light
energy
fire
whatever
it
was
issuing
from
the
rod
had
dazzled
him
into
momentary
blindness
and
a
vibration
of
force
through
the
air
was
like
a
blow
when
he
was
able
to
see
once
more
there
was
nothing
at
all
on
the
sand
where
the
corpse
had
lain
nothing
except
a
glassy
trough
from
which
some
spirals
of
vapor
arose
ross
clung
to
his
rock
support
badly
shaken
men
with
swords
and
now
this
some
form
of
controlled
energy
which
argued
of
technical
development
and
science
just
as
the
cliff
castle
had
bombarded
with
rocks
ships
sailing
with
a
speed
which
argued
engine
power
of
an
unknown
type
a
mixture
of
barbaric
and
advanced
knowledge
to
assess
this
he
needed
more
experience
more
knowledge
than
he
possessed
now
ashe
could
ashe
ross
was
jerked
back
to
his
own
quest
the
rod
was
quiet
no
more
sparks
were
flung
from
its
knob
and
under
ross
touch
his
sonic
was
quiet
also
he
snapped
off
the
broadcast
if
that
device
had
picked
up
the
flickering
of
the
rod
the
reverse
could
well
be
true
the
cloaked
one
chose
from
the
pile
of
goods
and
its
escort
gathered
up
the
designated
boxes
a
small
cask
or
two
so
laden
the
party
returned
south
the
way
they
had
come
ross
allowed
his
breath
to
expel
in
a
sigh
of
relief
he
worked
his
way
farther
north
along
the
coast
watching
other
parties
of
the
furred
workers
and
their
guards
lines
of
the
former
climbed
the
cliff
hauling
their
spoil
their
destination
the
castle
but
ross
saw
no
sign
of
ashe
received
no
answer
to
the
sonic
code
he
had
reset
once
the
strangers
were
out
of
distance
and
the
terran
began
to
realize
that
his
present
search
might
well
be
fruitless
though
he
fought
against
accepting
it
when
he
turned
back
to
the
slit
cave
ross
fear
was
ready
to
be
expressed
in
anger
the
anger
of
frustration
over
his
own
helplessness
with
no
chance
of
trying
to
penetrate
the
castle
he
could
not
learn
whether
or
not
ashe
had
been
taken
prisoner
and
until
the
workers
left
the
beach
he
could
not
prowl
there
hunting
the
grimmer
evidence
his
mind
flinched
from
considering
karara
waited
for
him
on
the
inner
ledge
there
was
no
sign
of
the
dolphins
and
as
ross
pulled
out
of
the
water
pushing
aside
his
mask
her
face
in
the
thin
light
of
the
cave
was
deeply
troubled
you
did
not
find
him
she
made
that
a
statement
rather
than
a
question
no
and
i
did
not
find
it
ross
used
a
length
of
weed
from
the
nest
as
a
towel
but
now
he
stood
very
still
the
gate
no
sign
of
it
just
this
she
reached
behind
her
and
brought
up
a
sealed
container
ross
recognized
one
of
the
supply
cans
they
had
had
in
the
cache
by
the
gate
there
are
others
scattered
taua
and
seek
them
now
it
is
as
if
all
that
was
on
the
other
side
was
sucked
through
with
us
you
are
sure
you
found
the
right
place
is
is
this
not
part
of
it
again
the
girl
sought
for
something
on
the
ledge
what
she
held
out
to
him
was
a
length
of
metal
rod
twisted
and
broken
at
one
end
as
if
a
giant
hand
had
wrenched
it
loose
from
the
installation
ross
nodded
dully
yes
his
voice
was
harsh
as
if
the
words
were
pulled
out
of
him
against
his
will
and
against
all
hope
that
part
of
a
side
bar
it
it
must
have
been
totally
wrecked
yet
even
though
he
held
that
broken
length
in
his
hands
ross
could
not
really
believe
the
gate
was
gone
he
swam
out
once
more
heading
for
the
reef
where
the
dolphins
joined
him
as
guides
there
was
a
second
piece
of
broken
tube
the
scattered
containers
of
supplies
that
was
all
the
terrans
were
wrecked
in
time
as
surely
as
those
ships
had
been
wrecked
on
the
sea
reef
the
night
before
ross
headed
once
again
for
the
cave
their
immediate
needs
were
of
major
importance
now
the
containers
must
be
all
gathered
and
taken
into
their
hiding
place
because
upon
their
contents
three
human
lives
could
depend
he
paused
just
at
the
entrance
to
adjust
the
net
of
containers
he
transported
and
it
was
that
slight
chance
which
brought
him
knowledge
of
the
intruder
on
the
ledge
karara
was
heaping
up
the
kelp
of
the
nest
but
to
one
side
and
on
a
level
with
the
girl
head
ross
dared
not
flash
his
torch
thus
betraying
his
presence
leaving
the
net
hitched
to
the
rock
by
its
sling
he
swam
under
water
along
the
side
of
the
cave
by
a
route
which
should
bring
him
out
within
striking
distance
of
that
hunched
figure
perching
above
to
watch
karara
every
move
loketh
the
useless
the
wash
of
waves
covered
ross
advance
until
he
came
up
against
the
wall
not
too
far
from
the
spy
perch
whoever
crouched
there
still
leaned
forward
to
watch
karara
and
ross
eyes
having
adjusted
to
the
gloom
of
the
cavern
made
out
the
outline
of
head
and
shoulders
the
next
two
or
three
minutes
were
the
critical
ones
for
the
terran
he
must
emerge
on
the
ledge
in
the
open
before
he
could
attack
karara
might
almost
have
read
his
mind
and
given
conscious
help
for
now
she
went
out
on
the
point
of
the
ledge
to
whistle
the
dolphins
summons
sleek
head
bobbed
above
water
as
he
answered
the
girl
with
a
bubbling
squeak
karara
knelt
and
the
dolphin
came
to
butt
against
her
hand
ross
heard
a
gasp
from
the
watcher
a
faint
sound
of
movement
karara
began
to
sing
softly
her
voice
rippling
in
one
of
the
liquid
chants
of
her
own
people
the
dolphin
interjecting
a
note
or
two
ross
had
heard
them
at
that
before
and
it
made
perfect
cover
for
his
move
he
sprang
his
grasp
tightened
on
flesh
fingers
closed
about
thin
wrists
there
was
a
yell
of
astonishment
and
fear
from
the
stranger
as
the
terran
jerked
him
from
his
perch
to
the
ledge
ross
had
his
opponent
flattened
under
him
before
he
realized
that
the
other
had
offered
no
struggle
but
lay
still
what
is
it
karara
torch
beam
caught
them
both
ross
looked
down
into
a
thin
brown
face
not
too
different
from
his
own
the
eyes
were
closed
and
the
mouth
gaped
open
though
he
believed
the
hawaikan
unconscious
ross
still
kept
hold
on
those
wrists
as
he
moved
from
the
sprawled
body
with
the
girl
aid
he
used
a
length
of
kelp
to
secure
the
captive
the
stranger
wore
a
garment
of
glistening
skintight
material
which
covered
body
legs
and
feet
but
left
his
lanky
arms
bare
a
belt
about
his
waist
had
loops
for
a
number
of
objects
among
them
a
knife
which
ross
prudently
removed
why
he
is
only
a
boy
karara
said
where
did
he
come
from
ross
the
terran
pointed
to
the
wall
crevice
he
was
up
there
watching
you
her
eyes
were
wide
and
round
why
ross
dragged
his
prisoner
back
against
the
wall
of
the
cave
after
witnessing
the
fate
of
those
who
had
swum
ashore
from
the
wreck
he
did
not
like
to
think
what
motive
might
have
brought
the
hawaikan
here
again
karara
thoughts
must
have
matched
his
for
she
added
but
he
did
not
even
draw
his
knife
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
ross
that
problem
already
occupied
the
terran
the
wisest
move
undoubtedly
was
to
kill
the
native
out
of
hand
but
such
ruthlessness
was
more
than
he
could
stomach
and
if
he
could
learn
anything
from
the
stranger
gain
some
knowledge
of
this
new
world
and
its
ways
he
would
be
twice
winner
why
this
encounter
might
even
lead
to
ashe
ross
his
leg
see
the
girl
pointed
the
tight
fit
of
the
alien
clothing
made
the
defect
clear
the
right
leg
of
the
stranger
was
shrunken
and
twisted
he
was
a
cripple
what
of
it
ross
demanded
sharply
this
was
no
time
for
an
appeal
to
the
sympathies
but
karara
did
not
urge
any
modification
of
the
bonds
as
he
half
feared
she
would
instead
she
sat
back
an
odd
withdrawn
expression
making
her
seem
remote
though
he
could
have
put
out
his
hand
to
touch
her
his
lameness
it
could
be
a
bridge
she
observed
to
mystification
a
bridge
what
do
you
mean
the
girl
shook
her
head
this
is
only
a
feeling
not
a
true
thought
but
also
it
is
important
look
i
think
he
is
waking
the
lids
above
those
large
eyes
were
fluttering
then
with
a
shake
of
the
head
the
hawaikan
blinked
up
at
them
blank
bewilderment
was
all
ross
could
read
in
the
stranger
expression
until
the
alien
saw
karara
then
a
flood
of
clicking
speech
poured
from
his
lips
he
seemed
utterly
astounded
when
they
made
no
answer
and
the
fluency
of
his
first
outburst
took
on
a
pleading
note
while
the
expectancy
of
his
first
greeting
faded
away
karara
spoke
to
ross
he
is
becoming
afraid
very
much
afraid
at
first
i
think
he
was
pleased
happy
but
why
the
girl
shook
her
head
i
do
not
know
i
can
only
feel
wait
her
hand
rose
in
imperious
command
she
did
not
rise
to
her
feet
but
crawled
on
hands
and
knees
to
the
edge
of
the
ledge
both
dolphins
were
there
raising
their
heads
well
out
of
the
water
their
actions
expressing
unusual
excitement
ross
karara
voice
rang
loudly
ross
they
can
understand
him
and
taua
can
understand
him
you
mean
they
understand
this
language
ross
found
that
fantastic
awesome
as
the
abilities
of
the
dolphins
were
no
his
mind
it
his
mind
ross
somehow
he
thinks
in
patterns
they
can
pick
up
and
read
they
do
that
you
know
with
a
few
of
us
but
not
in
the
same
way
this
is
more
direct
clearer
they
so
excited
ross
glanced
at
the
prisoner
the
alien
had
wriggled
about
striving
to
raise
his
head
against
the
wall
as
a
support
his
captor
pulled
the
hawaikan
into
a
sitting
position
but
the
native
accepted
that
aid
almost
as
if
he
were
not
even
aware
of
ross
hands
on
his
body
he
stared
with
a
kind
of
horrified
disbelief
at
the
bobbing
dolphin
heads
he
is
afraid
karara
reported
he
has
never
known
such
communication
before
can
they
ask
him
questions
demanded
ross
if
this
odd
mental
tie
between
terran
dolphin
and
hawaikan
did
exist
then
there
was
a
chance
to
learn
about
this
world
they
can
try
now
he
only
knows
fear
and
they
must
break
through
that
what
followed
was
the
most
unusual
conversation
ross
could
have
ever
imagined
he
put
a
question
to
karara
who
relayed
it
to
the
dolphins
in
turn
they
asked
it
mentally
of
the
hawaikan
and
conveyed
his
answer
back
via
the
same
route
it
took
some
time
to
allay
the
fears
of
the
stranger
but
at
last
the
hawaikan
entered
wholeheartedly
into
the
exchange
he
is
the
son
of
the
lord
ruling
the
castle
above
karara
produced
the
first
rational
and
complete
answer
but
for
some
reason
he
is
not
accepted
by
his
own
kind
perhaps
she
added
on
her
own
it
is
because
he
is
crippled
the
sea
is
his
home
as
he
expresses
it
and
he
believes
me
to
be
some
mythical
being
out
of
it
he
saw
me
swimming
masked
and
with
the
dolphins
and
he
is
sure
i
change
shape
at
will
she
hesitated
ross
i
get
something
odd
here
he
does
know
or
thinks
he
knows
creatures
who
can
appear
and
disappear
at
will
and
he
is
afraid
of
their
powers
gods
and
goddesses
perfectly
natural
karara
shook
her
head
no
this
is
more
concrete
than
a
religious
belief
ross
had
a
sudden
inspiration
hurriedly
he
described
the
cloaked
figure
who
had
driven
the
castle
people
from
the
piles
of
salvage
ask
him
about
that
one
she
relayed
the
question
ross
saw
the
prisoner
head
jerk
around
the
hawaikan
looked
from
karara
to
her
companion
a
shade
of
speculation
in
his
expression
he
wants
to
know
why
you
ask
about
the
foanna
surely
you
must
well
know
what
manner
of
beings
they
are
listen
ross
was
sure
now
that
he
had
made
a
real
discovery
though
its
importance
he
could
not
guess
tell
him
we
come
from
where
there
are
no
foanna
that
we
have
powers
and
must
know
of
their
powers
if
he
could
only
carry
on
this
interrogation
straight
and
not
have
to
depend
upon
a
double
translation
and
could
he
even
be
sure
his
questions
reached
the
alien
undistorted
wearily
ross
sat
back
on
his
heels
then
he
glanced
at
karara
with
a
twinge
of
concern
if
he
was
tired
by
their
roundabout
communication
she
must
be
doubly
so
there
was
a
droop
to
her
shoulders
and
her
last
reply
had
come
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
fatigue
abruptly
he
started
up
that
enough
for
now
which
was
true
he
had
to
have
time
for
evaluation
to
adjust
to
what
they
had
learned
during
the
steady
stream
of
questions
passed
back
and
forth
and
in
that
moment
he
was
conscious
of
his
hunger
just
as
his
voice
was
paper
dry
from
lack
of
drink
the
canister
of
supplies
he
had
left
by
the
cave
entrance
we
need
food
and
drink
he
fumbled
with
his
mask
but
karara
motioned
him
back
from
the
water
taua
brings
wait
the
dolphin
trailed
the
net
of
containers
to
them
ross
unscrewed
one
pulled
out
a
bulb
of
fresh
water
a
second
box
yielded
the
dry
wafers
of
emergency
rations
then
after
a
moment
hesitation
ross
crossed
to
the
prisoner
cut
his
wrist
bonds
and
pressed
both
a
bulb
and
a
wafer
into
his
hold
the
hawaikan
watched
the
terrans
eat
before
he
bit
into
the
wafer
chewing
it
with
vigor
turning
the
bulb
around
in
his
fingers
with
alert
interest
before
he
sucked
at
its
contents
as
ross
chewed
and
swallowed
mechanically
and
certainly
with
no
relish
he
fitted
one
fact
to
another
to
make
a
picture
of
this
hawaikan
time
period
in
which
they
were
now
marooned
of
course
his
picture
was
based
on
facts
they
had
learned
from
their
captive
perhaps
he
had
purposely
misled
them
or
fogged
some
essentials
but
could
he
have
done
that
in
a
mental
contact
ross
would
simply
have
to
accept
everything
with
a
certain
amount
of
cautious
skepticism
anyway
there
were
the
wreckers
of
the
castle
petty
lordlings
setting
up
their
holds
along
the
coasts
preying
upon
the
shipping
which
was
the
lifeblood
of
this
world
the
terrans
had
seen
them
in
action
last
night
and
today
and
if
the
captive
information
was
correct
it
was
not
only
the
storm
fury
which
brought
the
harvest
the
wreckers
had
some
method
of
attracting
ships
to
crack
up
on
their
reefs
some
method
of
attraction
and
that
force
which
had
pulled
the
terrans
through
the
time
gate
could
there
be
a
connection
however
there
remained
the
wreckers
on
the
cliff
and
their
prey
the
seafarers
of
the
ocean
with
an
understandably
deep
enmity
between
them
those
two
parties
ross
could
understand
and
be
prepared
to
deal
with
he
thought
but
there
remained
the
foanna
and
from
their
explanation
the
foanna
were
a
very
different
matter
they
possessed
a
power
which
did
not
depend
upon
swords
or
ships
or
the
natural
tools
and
weapons
of
men
no
they
had
strengths
which
were
unearthly
to
give
them
superiority
in
all
but
one
way
numbers
though
the
foanna
had
their
warriors
and
servants
as
ross
had
seen
on
the
beach
they
themselves
were
of
another
race
a
very
old
and
dying
race
of
which
few
remained
how
many
their
enemies
could
not
say
for
the
foanna
had
no
separate
identities
known
to
the
outer
world
they
appeared
gave
their
orders
levied
their
demands
opposed
or
aided
as
they
wished
always
just
one
or
two
at
a
time
always
so
muffled
in
their
cloaks
that
even
their
physical
appearances
remained
a
mystery
but
there
was
no
mystery
about
their
powers
ross
gathered
that
no
wrecker
lord
no
matter
how
much
a
leader
among
his
own
kind
how
ambitious
had
yet
dared
to
oppose
actively
one
of
the
foanna
though
he
might
make
a
token
protest
against
some
demand
from
them
and
certainly
the
captive
description
of
those
powers
in
action
suggested
a
supernatural
origin
of
foanna
knowledge
or
at
least
for
its
application
but
ross
thought
that
the
answer
might
be
that
they
possessed
the
remnants
of
some
almost
forgotten
technical
the
heritage
of
a
very
old
race
he
had
tried
to
learn
something
of
the
origin
of
the
foanna
themselves
wondering
if
the
robed
ones
could
be
from
the
galactic
empire
but
the
answer
had
come
that
the
foanna
were
older
than
recorded
time
that
they
had
lived
in
the
great
citadel
before
the
race
of
the
terrans
prisoner
had
risen
from
very
primitive
savagery
what
do
we
do
now
karara
broke
in
upon
ross
thoughts
as
she
refastened
the
containers
these
slaves
that
the
wreckers
take
upon
occasion
maybe
ashe
ross
was
catching
at
very
fragile
straws
he
had
to
and
the
stranger
had
said
that
men
who
swam
ashore
relatively
uninjured
were
taken
captive
several
had
been
the
night
before
loketh
ross
and
karara
looked
around
the
prisoner
put
down
the
water
bulb
and
one
of
his
hands
made
a
gesture
they
could
not
mistake
he
pointed
to
himself
and
repeated
that
word
loketh
the
terran
touched
his
own
chest
ross
murdock
perhaps
the
other
was
as
impatient
as
he
with
their
roundabout
method
of
communication
and
had
decided
to
try
and
speed
it
up
the
analyzer
ashe
had
included
the
analyzer
with
the
equipment
by
the
gate
if
ross
could
find
that
why
then
the
major
problem
could
be
behind
them
swiftly
he
explained
to
karara
and
with
a
vigorous
nod
of
assent
she
called
to
taua
ordering
the
rest
of
the
salvage
material
from
the
gate
be
brought
to
them
loketh
ross
pointed
to
the
youth
ross
that
was
himself
karara
he
indicated
the
girl
rosss
the
alien
made
a
clicking
hiss
of
the
first
name
karara
he
did
better
with
the
second
ross
carefully
unpacked
the
box
taua
had
located
he
had
only
slight
knowledge
of
how
the
device
worked
it
was
intended
to
record
a
strange
language
break
it
down
into
symbols
already
familiar
to
the
time
agents
but
could
it
also
be
used
as
a
translator
with
a
totally
alien
tongue
he
could
only
hope
that
the
rough
handling
of
its
journey
through
the
gate
had
not
damaged
it
and
that
the
experiment
might
possibly
work
putting
the
box
between
them
he
explained
what
he
wanted
and
karara
took
up
the
small
speaking
slowly
and
distinctly
the
same
liquid
syllables
she
had
used
in
the
dolphin
song
ross
clicked
the
lever
when
she
was
finished
and
watched
the
small
screen
the
symbols
which
flashed
there
had
meaning
for
him
right
enough
he
could
translate
what
she
had
just
taped
the
machine
still
worked
to
that
extent
now
he
pushed
the
box
into
place
before
loketh
and
made
the
visibly
reluctant
hawaikan
take
the
disk
from
karara
then
through
the
dolphin
link
ross
passed
on
definite
instructions
would
it
work
as
well
to
translate
a
stellar
tongue
as
it
had
with
languages
past
and
present
of
his
own
planet
reluctantly
loketh
began
to
talk
to
the
disk
at
first
in
a
very
rapid
mumble
and
then
as
there
was
no
frightening
response
with
less
speed
and
more
confidence
there
were
symbol
lines
on
the
in
accordance
and
some
of
them
made
sense
ross
was
elated
ask
him
can
one
enter
the
castle
unseen
to
check
on
the
slaves
for
what
reason
ross
was
sure
he
had
read
those
symbols
correctly
tell
him
that
one
of
our
kind
may
be
among
them
loketh
did
not
reply
so
quickly
this
time
his
eyes
grave
and
measuring
studied
ross
then
karara
then
ross
again
there
is
a
way
discovered
by
this
useless
one
ross
did
not
pay
attention
to
the
odd
adjective
loketh
chose
to
describe
himself
he
pressed
to
the
important
matter
can
and
will
he
show
me
that
way
again
that
long
moment
of
appraisal
on
the
part
of
loketh
before
he
answered
ross
found
himself
reading
the
reply
symbols
aloud
if
you
dare
then
i
will
lead
witches
meat
he
might
be
recklessly
endangering
all
of
them
ross
knew
but
if
ashe
was
immured
somewhere
in
that
rock
pile
over
their
heads
then
the
risk
of
trusting
loketh
would
be
worth
it
however
because
ross
was
chancing
his
own
neck
did
not
mean
that
karara
need
be
drawn
into
immediate
peril
too
with
the
dolphins
at
her
command
and
the
supplies
scanty
as
those
were
she
would
have
a
good
chance
to
hide
here
safely
holding
out
for
what
she
asked
quietly
after
ross
elaborated
on
this
subject
thus
bringing
him
to
silence
because
her
question
was
just
with
the
gate
gone
the
terrans
were
committed
to
this
time
just
as
they
had
earlier
been
committed
to
hawaika
when
on
their
home
world
they
had
entered
the
spaceship
for
the
there
was
no
escape
from
the
past
which
had
become
their
present
the
foanna
she
continued
these
wreckers
the
sea
people
all
at
odds
with
one
another
do
we
join
any
then
their
quarrels
must
also
become
ours
taua
nosed
the
ledge
behind
the
girl
squeaked
a
demand
for
attention
karara
looked
around
at
loketh
her
look
was
as
searching
as
the
one
the
native
had
earlier
turned
on
her
and
ross
he
the
girl
nodded
at
the
hawaikan
wishes
to
know
if
you
trust
him
and
he
says
to
tell
you
this
because
the
shades
chose
to
inflict
upon
him
a
twisted
leg
he
is
not
one
with
those
of
the
castle
but
to
them
a
broken
useless
thing
ross
i
gather
he
thinks
we
have
powers
like
the
foanna
and
that
we
may
be
supernatural
but
because
we
did
not
kill
him
out
of
hand
and
have
fed
him
he
considers
himself
bound
to
us
ritual
of
bread
and
salt
could
be
though
it
might
be
folly
to
match
alien
customs
to
terran
ross
thought
of
that
very
ancient
pact
on
his
own
world
eat
a
man
food
become
his
friend
or
at
least
declare
a
truce
between
you
stiff
taboos
and
codes
of
behavior
marked
nations
on
terra
especially
warrior
societies
and
the
same
might
be
true
here
ask
him
ross
told
karara
what
is
the
rule
for
food
and
drink
between
friends
or
enemies
the
more
he
could
learn
of
such
customs
the
better
protection
he
might
be
able
to
weave
for
them
long
moments
for
the
relay
of
that
message
and
then
loketh
spoke
into
the
of
the
analyzer
slowly
with
pauses
as
if
trying
to
make
sure
ross
understood
every
word
to
give
bread
into
the
hands
of
one
you
have
taken
in
battle
makes
him
your
man
not
as
a
slave
to
labor
but
as
one
who
draws
sword
at
your
bidding
when
i
took
your
bread
i
accepted
you
as
between
such
there
is
no
betrayal
for
how
may
a
man
betray
his
lord
i
loketh
am
now
a
sword
in
your
hands
a
man
in
your
service
and
to
me
this
is
doubly
good
for
as
a
useless
one
i
have
never
had
a
lord
nor
one
to
swear
to
also
with
this
sea
maid
and
her
followers
to
listen
to
thoughts
how
could
any
man
speak
with
a
double
tongue
were
he
one
who
consorted
with
the
shadow
and
wore
the
cloak
of
evil
he
right
karara
added
his
mind
is
open
he
could
hide
his
thoughts
from
taua
and
even
if
he
wished
all
right
i
accept
that
ross
glanced
about
the
ledge
they
had
piled
the
containers
at
the
far
end
for
karara
to
move
might
be
safe
he
said
so
move
where
she
asked
flatly
those
men
from
the
castle
are
still
hunting
drift
out
there
i
do
think
anyone
knows
of
this
cave
ross
nodded
to
loketh
he
did
did
he
i
would
want
you
trapped
here
and
i
do
want
to
lose
those
supplies
what
is
in
those
containers
may
be
what
saves
us
all
we
can
sink
those
over
by
the
wall
weight
them
down
in
a
net
then
if
we
have
to
move
they
will
be
ready
do
not
worry
that
is
my
department
she
smiled
at
him
with
a
slightly
mocking
lift
of
lips
ross
subsided
though
he
was
irritated
because
she
was
right
the
management
of
the
dolphin
team
and
sea
matters
were
her
department
and
while
he
resented
her
reminder
of
that
point
he
could
not
deny
the
justice
of
her
retort
in
spite
of
his
crippled
leg
loketh
displayed
an
agility
which
surprised
ross
freed
from
his
ankle
bonds
he
beckoned
the
terran
back
to
the
very
niche
where
he
had
hidden
to
watch
karara
up
he
swung
into
that
and
in
a
second
had
vanished
from
sight
ross
followed
to
discover
it
was
not
a
niche
after
all
but
the
opening
of
a
crevice
leading
upward
as
a
vent
and
it
had
been
used
before
as
a
passage
there
was
no
light
but
the
native
guided
ross
hands
to
the
hollow
climbing
holds
cut
into
the
stone
then
loketh
pushed
past
and
went
up
the
crude
ladder
into
the
dark
it
was
difficult
to
judge
either
time
or
distance
in
this
black
tube
ross
counted
the
holds
for
some
check
his
agent
training
made
one
part
of
his
mind
sharply
aware
of
such
things
the
need
for
memorizing
a
passage
which
led
into
the
enemy
territory
was
apparent
what
the
purpose
of
this
slit
had
originally
been
he
did
not
know
but
strongholds
on
terra
had
had
their
hidden
ways
in
and
out
for
use
in
times
of
siege
and
he
was
beginning
to
believe
that
these
aliens
had
much
in
common
with
his
own
kind
he
had
reached
twenty
in
his
counting
and
his
senses
alerted
by
training
and
instinct
told
him
there
was
an
opening
not
too
far
above
but
the
darkness
remained
so
thick
it
fell
in
tangible
folds
about
his
sweating
body
ross
almost
cried
out
as
fingers
clamped
about
his
wrist
when
he
reached
for
a
new
hold
then
urged
by
that
grasp
he
was
up
and
out
sprawling
into
a
vertical
passage
far
ahead
was
a
gray
of
faint
light
ross
choked
and
then
sneezed
as
dust
puffed
up
from
between
his
scrabbling
hands
the
hold
which
had
been
on
his
wrist
shifted
to
his
shoulder
and
with
a
surprising
strength
loketh
hauled
the
terran
to
his
feet
the
passage
in
which
they
stood
was
a
slit
extending
in
height
well
above
their
heads
but
narrow
not
much
wider
than
ross
shoulders
whether
it
was
a
natural
fault
or
had
been
cut
he
could
not
tell
loketh
was
ahead
again
his
rocking
limp
making
the
outline
of
his
body
a
jerky
shadow
again
his
speed
and
agility
amazed
the
terran
loketh
might
be
lame
but
he
had
learned
to
adapt
to
his
handicap
very
well
the
light
increased
and
ross
marked
slits
in
the
walls
to
his
right
no
wider
than
the
breadth
of
his
two
fingers
he
peered
out
of
one
and
was
looking
into
empty
air
while
below
he
heard
the
murmur
of
the
sea
this
way
must
run
in
the
cliff
face
above
the
beach
a
click
of
impatient
whisper
drew
him
on
to
join
loketh
here
was
a
flight
of
stairs
narrow
of
tread
and
very
steep
loketh
turned
back
and
side
against
these
to
climb
his
outspread
hand
flattened
on
the
stone
as
if
it
possessed
adhesive
qualities
to
steady
him
for
the
first
time
his
twisted
leg
was
a
disadvantage
ross
counted
again
ten
fifteen
of
those
steps
bringing
them
once
more
into
darkness
then
they
emerged
from
a
opening
into
a
circular
room
a
sudden
and
dazzling
flare
of
light
made
the
terran
shade
his
eyes
loketh
set
a
pallid
but
glowing
cone
on
a
wall
shelf
and
the
terran
discovered
that
the
burst
of
light
was
only
relative
to
the
dark
of
the
passage
indeed
it
was
very
weak
illumination
the
hawaikan
braced
his
body
against
the
far
wall
the
strain
of
his
effort
whatever
its
purpose
was
easy
to
read
in
the
contorted
line
of
his
shoulders
then
the
wall
slid
under
loketh
urging
a
slow
move
as
if
the
weight
of
the
slab
he
strove
to
handle
was
almost
too
great
for
his
slender
arms
or
else
the
need
for
caution
was
intensified
here
they
now
fronted
a
narrow
opening
and
the
light
of
the
cone
shone
only
a
few
feet
into
the
space
loketh
beckoned
to
ross
and
they
went
on
here
the
left
wall
was
cut
in
many
places
emitting
patches
of
light
in
a
way
which
bore
no
resemblance
to
conventional
windows
it
was
like
walking
behind
a
pierced
screen
which
followed
no
logical
pattern
in
the
cutaway
portions
ross
gazed
out
and
gasped
he
was
standing
above
the
center
core
of
the
castle
and
the
life
below
and
beyond
drew
his
attention
he
had
seen
drawings
reproducing
the
life
of
a
feudal
castle
this
resembled
them
and
yet
as
ross
studied
the
scene
closer
the
differences
between
the
terran
past
and
this
became
more
distinct
in
the
first
place
there
were
those
animals
or
were
they
animals
being
hooked
up
to
a
cart
they
had
six
limbs
walking
on
four
holding
the
remaining
two
folded
under
their
necks
their
harness
consisted
of
a
network
fitted
over
their
shoulders
anchored
to
the
folded
limbs
their
grotesque
heads
bobbing
and
weaving
on
lengthy
necks
their
bodies
were
sleekly
scaled
ross
was
startled
by
a
resemblance
he
traced
to
the
sea
dragon
he
had
met
in
the
future
of
this
world
but
the
creatures
were
subject
to
the
men
harnessing
them
and
the
activity
in
other
respects
ross
had
to
fight
a
wayward
and
fascinated
interest
in
all
he
could
see
force
himself
to
concentrate
on
learning
what
might
be
pertinent
to
his
own
mission
but
loketh
did
not
allow
him
to
watch
for
long
instead
his
hand
on
the
terran
arm
urged
the
other
down
the
gallery
behind
the
screen
and
once
more
into
the
bulk
of
the
fortress
another
narrow
way
ran
through
the
thickness
of
the
walls
then
a
patch
of
light
not
that
of
outer
day
but
a
reddish
gleam
from
an
opening
waist
high
there
loketh
went
awkwardly
to
his
good
knee
motioning
ross
to
follow
his
example
what
lay
below
was
a
hall
furnished
with
a
barbaric
rawness
of
color
and
glitter
there
were
long
strips
of
brightly
hued
woven
stuff
on
the
walls
touched
here
and
there
with
sparkling
glints
which
were
and
set
at
intervals
among
the
hangings
were
oval
objects
perhaps
ross
height
on
which
were
designs
and
patterns
picked
out
in
paint
and
metal
maybe
the
stylized
representation
of
native
plants
and
animals
the
whole
gave
an
impression
of
clashing
color
just
as
the
garments
of
those
gathered
there
were
garish
in
turn
there
were
three
hawaikans
on
the
dais
all
wore
robes
fitting
tightly
to
the
upper
portion
of
their
bodies
girded
to
their
waists
with
elaborate
belts
then
falling
in
long
points
to
floor
level
the
points
being
finished
off
with
tassels
their
heads
were
covered
with
tight
caps
which
were
a
latticework
of
decorated
strips
glittering
as
they
moved
and
the
mixture
of
colors
in
their
apparel
was
such
as
to
offend
terran
eyes
with
their
harsh
clash
of
shade
against
shade
drawn
up
below
the
dais
were
two
rows
of
guards
but
the
reason
for
the
assembly
baffled
ross
since
he
could
not
understand
the
clicking
speech
there
came
a
hollow
echoing
sound
as
from
a
gong
the
three
on
the
dais
straightened
turned
their
attention
to
the
other
end
of
the
hall
ross
did
not
need
loketh
gesture
to
know
that
something
of
importance
was
about
to
begin
down
the
hall
was
a
somber
note
in
the
splash
of
clashing
color
the
terran
recognized
the
robe
of
the
foanna
there
were
three
of
the
robed
ones
this
time
one
slightly
in
advance
of
the
other
two
they
came
at
a
gliding
pace
as
if
they
swept
along
above
that
paved
flooring
not
by
planting
feet
upon
it
as
they
halted
below
the
dais
the
men
there
rose
ross
could
read
their
reluctance
to
make
that
concession
in
the
slowness
of
their
movements
they
were
plainly
being
compelled
to
render
deference
when
they
longed
to
refuse
it
then
the
middle
one
of
the
castle
lords
spoke
first
zahur
loketh
breathed
in
ross
ear
his
pointed
finger
indicating
the
speaker
ross
longed
vainly
for
the
ability
to
ask
questions
a
chance
to
know
what
was
in
progress
that
the
meeting
of
the
two
hawaikan
factions
was
important
he
did
not
doubt
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
after
the
castle
lord
finished
speaking
to
the
terran
this
spun
on
and
on
and
he
sensed
the
mounting
tension
this
must
be
a
showdown
perhaps
even
a
declaration
of
open
hostilities
between
wreckers
and
the
older
race
or
perhaps
the
pause
was
a
subtle
weapon
of
the
foanna
used
to
throw
a
enemy
off
balance
as
a
judo
fighter
might
use
an
opponent
attack
as
part
of
his
own
defense
when
the
foanna
did
make
answer
it
came
in
the
singsong
of
chanted
words
ross
felt
loketh
shiver
felt
the
crawl
of
chill
along
his
own
spine
the
words
if
those
were
words
and
not
just
sounds
intended
to
play
upon
the
mind
and
emotions
of
a
listener
cut
into
one
ross
wanted
to
close
his
ears
thrust
his
fingers
into
them
to
drown
out
that
sound
yet
he
did
not
have
the
power
to
raise
his
hands
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
men
on
the
dais
were
swaying
now
as
if
the
chant
were
a
rope
leashed
about
them
pulling
them
back
and
forth
there
was
a
clatter
one
of
the
guards
had
fallen
to
the
floor
and
lay
there
rolling
his
hands
to
his
head
a
shout
from
the
dais
the
chanting
reached
a
note
so
high
that
ross
felt
the
torment
in
his
ears
below
the
lines
of
guards
had
broken
a
party
of
them
were
heading
for
the
end
of
the
hall
making
a
wide
detour
around
the
foanna
loketh
gave
a
small
choked
cry
his
fingers
tightened
on
ross
forearm
with
painful
intensity
as
he
whispered
what
was
about
to
happen
meant
something
important
to
loketh
or
to
him
ashe
was
this
concerned
with
ashe
ross
crowded
against
the
opening
tried
to
see
the
direction
in
which
the
guards
had
disappeared
the
wait
made
him
doubly
impatient
one
of
the
men
on
the
dais
had
dropped
on
the
bench
there
his
head
forward
on
his
hands
his
shoulders
quivering
but
the
one
loketh
had
identified
as
zahur
still
fronted
the
foanna
spokesman
and
ross
gave
tribute
to
the
strength
of
will
which
kept
him
there
they
were
returning
the
guards
and
herded
between
their
lines
three
men
two
were
hawaikans
their
bare
dark
bodies
easily
identifiable
but
the
third
ashe
ross
almost
shouted
his
name
aloud
the
terran
stumbled
along
and
there
was
a
bandage
above
his
knee
he
had
been
stripped
to
his
swimming
trunks
all
his
equipment
taken
from
him
there
was
a
dark
bruise
on
his
left
temple
the
angry
weal
of
a
lash
mark
on
neck
and
shoulder
ross
hands
clenched
never
in
his
life
had
he
so
desperately
wanted
a
weapon
as
he
did
at
that
moment
to
spray
the
company
below
with
a
machine
gun
would
have
given
him
great
satisfaction
but
he
had
nothing
but
the
knife
in
his
belt
and
he
was
as
cut
off
from
ashe
as
if
they
were
in
separate
cells
of
some
prison
the
caution
which
had
been
one
of
his
inborn
gifts
and
which
had
been
fostered
by
his
training
clamped
down
on
his
first
wild
desire
for
action
there
was
not
the
slightest
chance
of
his
doing
ashe
any
good
at
the
present
but
he
had
this
much
he
knew
that
gordon
was
alive
and
that
he
was
in
the
aliens
hands
faced
by
those
facts
ross
could
plan
his
own
moves
the
foanna
chant
began
again
and
the
three
prisoners
moved
the
two
hawaikans
turned
set
themselves
on
either
side
of
ashe
and
gave
him
support
their
actions
had
a
mechanical
quality
as
if
they
were
directed
by
a
will
beyond
their
own
ashe
gazed
about
him
at
the
wreckers
and
the
robed
figures
his
awareness
of
them
both
suggested
to
ross
that
if
the
natives
had
come
under
the
control
of
the
foanna
the
terran
resisted
their
influence
but
ashe
did
not
try
to
escape
the
assistance
of
his
two
fellow
prisoners
and
he
limped
with
their
aid
back
down
the
hall
following
the
foanna
ross
deduced
that
the
captives
had
been
transferred
from
the
lord
of
the
castle
to
the
foanna
which
meant
ashe
was
on
his
way
to
another
destination
the
terran
was
on
his
feet
and
headed
back
intent
on
returning
to
the
sea
cave
and
starting
out
after
ashe
as
soon
as
he
could
you
have
found
gordon
karara
read
his
news
from
his
face
the
wreckers
had
him
prisoner
now
they
turned
him
over
to
the
foanna
what
will
do
with
him
the
girl
demanded
of
loketh
his
answer
came
roundabout
as
usual
as
the
native
squatted
by
the
analyzer
and
clicked
his
answer
into
it
they
have
claimed
the
wreck
survivors
for
tribute
your
companion
will
be
witches
meat
witches
meat
repeated
ross
uncomprehending
then
karara
drew
a
gagged
breath
which
was
a
gasp
of
horror
sacrifice
ross
he
must
mean
they
are
going
to
use
gordon
for
a
sacrifice
ross
stiffened
and
then
whirled
to
catch
loketh
by
the
shoulders
the
inability
to
question
the
native
directly
was
an
added
disaster
now
where
are
they
taking
him
where
he
began
that
fiercely
and
then
forced
control
on
himself
karara
eyes
were
half
closed
her
head
back
she
was
manifestly
aiming
that
inquiry
at
the
dolphins
to
be
translated
to
loketh
symbols
burned
on
the
analyzer
screen
the
foanna
have
their
own
fortress
it
can
be
entered
best
by
sea
there
is
a
boat
i
can
show
you
for
it
is
my
own
secret
tell
him
yes
as
soon
as
we
can
ross
broke
out
the
old
feeling
that
time
was
worried
at
him
witches
meat
witches
meat
the
words
were
sharp
as
a
lash
the
free
rovers
twilight
made
a
gray
world
where
one
could
not
trace
the
true
meeting
of
land
and
water
sea
and
sky
surely
the
haze
about
them
was
more
than
just
the
normal
dusk
of
coming
night
ross
balanced
in
the
middle
of
the
skiff
as
it
bobbed
along
the
swell
of
waves
inside
a
barrier
reef
to
his
mind
the
craft
carrying
the
three
of
them
and
their
net
of
supplies
was
too
frail
rode
too
high
but
karara
paddling
in
the
bow
loketh
at
the
stern
seemed
to
be
content
and
ross
could
not
for
pride
sake
question
their
competency
he
comforted
himself
with
the
knowledge
that
no
agent
was
able
to
absorb
every
primitive
skill
and
karara
people
had
explored
the
pacific
in
canoes
hardly
more
stable
than
their
present
vessel
navigating
by
currents
and
stars
smothering
his
feeling
of
helplessness
and
the
slow
anger
that
roused
in
him
the
terran
busied
himself
with
study
of
a
sort
they
had
had
the
longer
part
of
the
day
in
the
cave
before
loketh
would
agree
to
venture
out
of
hiding
and
paddle
south
ross
using
the
analyzer
had
with
loketh
aid
set
about
learning
what
he
could
of
the
native
tongue
now
possessed
of
a
working
vocabulary
of
clicked
words
he
was
able
to
follow
loketh
speech
so
that
translation
through
the
dolphins
was
not
necessary
except
for
complicated
directions
also
he
had
a
more
detailed
briefing
of
the
present
situation
on
hawaika
enough
to
know
that
they
might
be
embarking
on
a
mad
venture
the
citadel
of
the
foanna
was
distinctly
forbidden
ground
not
only
for
loketh
people
but
also
for
the
foanna
hawaikan
followers
who
were
housed
and
labored
in
an
outer
ring
of
those
natives
were
ross
gathered
a
hereditary
corps
of
servants
and
warriors
born
to
that
status
and
not
recruited
from
the
native
population
at
large
as
such
they
were
armored
by
the
magic
of
their
masters
if
the
foanna
are
so
powerful
ross
had
demanded
why
do
you
go
with
us
against
them
to
depend
so
heavily
on
the
native
made
him
uneasy
the
hawaikan
looked
to
karara
one
of
his
hands
raised
his
fingers
sketched
a
sign
toward
the
girl
with
the
sea
maid
and
her
magic
i
do
not
fear
he
paused
before
adding
always
has
it
been
said
of
me
and
to
me
that
i
am
a
useless
one
fit
only
to
do
women
tasks
no
word
weaver
shall
ever
chant
my
battle
deeds
in
the
great
hall
of
zahur
i
who
am
zahur
true
son
can
not
carry
my
sword
in
any
lord
train
but
now
you
offer
me
one
of
the
great
quests
if
i
go
so
may
i
prove
that
i
am
a
man
even
if
i
go
limpingly
there
is
nothing
the
foanna
can
do
to
me
which
is
worse
than
what
the
shadow
has
already
done
choosing
to
follow
you
i
may
stand
up
to
face
zahur
in
his
own
hall
show
him
that
the
blood
of
his
house
has
not
been
drained
from
my
veins
because
i
walk
crookedly
there
was
such
bitter
fire
not
only
in
the
sputtering
rush
of
words
but
in
his
eyes
his
face
the
wry
twist
of
his
lips
that
ross
believed
him
the
terran
no
longer
had
any
doubts
that
the
castle
outcast
was
willing
to
brave
the
unknown
terrors
of
the
foanna
keep
not
just
to
aid
ross
whom
he
considered
himself
bound
to
serve
by
the
customs
of
his
people
but
because
he
saw
in
this
venture
a
chance
to
gain
what
he
had
never
had
a
place
in
his
warrior
culture
shut
off
from
the
normal
life
of
his
people
he
had
early
turned
to
the
sea
his
twisted
leg
had
not
proved
a
handicap
in
the
water
and
he
stated
with
confidence
that
he
was
the
best
swimmer
in
the
castle
not
that
the
men
of
his
father
following
had
taken
greatly
to
the
sea
which
they
looked
upon
merely
as
a
way
of
preying
upon
the
true
sea
rovers
the
reef
on
which
the
ships
had
been
wrecked
was
a
snare
of
sorts
first
by
the
whim
of
nature
when
wind
and
current
piled
up
the
trading
ships
there
then
ross
was
startled
when
loketh
elaborated
on
a
later
development
of
that
trap
so
zahur
returned
from
this
meeting
and
set
up
a
great
magic
among
the
rock
according
to
the
spells
he
was
taught
now
ships
are
drawn
there
so
the
wrecks
have
been
many
and
zahur
becomes
an
even
greater
lord
with
many
men
coming
to
take
sword
oath
under
him
this
magic
asked
ross
of
what
manner
is
it
and
where
did
zahur
obtain
it
it
is
fashioned
so
loketh
sketched
two
straight
lines
in
the
air
not
curved
as
a
sword
and
the
color
of
water
under
a
storm
sky
both
rods
being
as
tall
as
a
man
there
was
much
care
to
set
them
in
place
that
was
done
by
a
man
of
glicmas
a
man
of
glicmas
glicmas
is
now
the
high
lord
of
the
iccio
he
is
blood
kin
to
zahur
yet
zahur
must
take
sword
oath
to
send
to
glicmas
a
fourth
of
all
his
for
a
year
in
payment
for
this
magic
and
glicmas
where
did
he
get
it
from
the
foanna
loketh
made
an
emphatic
denial
of
that
no
the
foanna
have
spoken
out
against
their
use
making
even
greater
ill
feeling
between
the
old
ones
and
the
coast
people
it
is
said
that
glicmas
saw
a
great
wonder
in
the
sky
and
followed
it
to
a
high
place
of
his
own
country
a
mountain
broke
in
twain
and
a
voice
issued
forth
from
the
rent
calling
that
the
lord
of
the
country
come
and
stand
to
hear
it
when
glicmas
did
so
he
was
told
that
the
magic
would
be
his
then
the
mountain
closed
again
and
he
found
many
strange
things
upon
the
ground
as
he
uses
them
they
make
him
akin
to
the
foanna
in
power
some
he
gives
to
those
who
are
his
blood
kin
and
together
they
will
be
great
until
they
close
their
fists
not
only
upon
the
sea
rovers
but
upon
the
foanna
also
this
they
have
come
to
believe
but
you
do
not
karara
asked
then
i
do
not
know
sea
maid
the
time
is
coming
when
perhaps
they
shall
have
their
chance
to
prove
how
strong
is
their
magic
already
the
rovers
gather
in
fleets
as
they
never
did
before
and
it
seems
that
they
too
have
found
a
new
magic
for
their
ships
fly
through
the
water
depending
no
longer
on
sails
or
upon
strong
arms
of
men
at
long
paddles
there
is
a
struggle
before
us
but
that
you
must
know
being
who
and
what
you
are
sea
maid
and
what
do
you
think
i
am
what
do
you
think
ross
is
if
the
foanna
dwell
on
land
and
hold
old
knowledge
and
power
beyond
our
reckoning
in
their
two
hands
he
replied
then
it
is
possible
that
the
same
could
have
roots
in
the
sea
it
is
my
belief
that
you
are
of
the
shades
but
not
the
shadow
and
this
warrior
is
also
of
your
kind
but
perhaps
in
different
degree
putting
into
action
your
desires
and
wishes
thus
if
you
go
up
against
the
foanna
you
shall
be
well
matched
kind
to
kind
nice
to
be
so
certain
of
that
ross
thought
he
did
not
share
confidence
on
that
subject
the
shades
the
shadow
karara
persisted
what
are
these
loketh
an
odd
expression
crossed
the
hawaikan
face
are
those
not
known
to
you
sea
maid
indeed
then
you
are
of
a
breed
different
from
the
men
of
land
the
shades
are
those
of
power
who
may
come
to
the
aid
of
men
should
it
be
their
desire
to
influence
the
future
and
the
shadow
the
shadow
is
that
which
ends
all
man
hope
good
to
which
there
is
no
appeal
and
which
holds
a
vast
and
enduring
hatred
for
that
which
has
life
and
full
substance
so
zahur
has
this
new
magic
is
it
the
gift
of
shades
or
shadow
ross
brought
them
back
to
the
subject
which
had
sparked
in
him
a
small
warning
signal
zahur
prospers
mightily
loketh
answer
was
ambiguous
and
so
the
shadow
could
not
provide
such
magic
the
terran
pushed
but
before
the
hawaikan
had
a
chance
to
answer
karara
added
another
question
but
you
believe
that
it
did
i
do
not
know
only
the
magic
has
made
zahur
a
part
of
glicmas
and
glicmas
is
now
perhaps
a
part
of
that
which
spoke
from
the
mountain
it
is
not
well
to
accept
gifts
which
tie
one
man
to
another
unless
there
is
from
the
first
a
saying
of
how
deep
that
bond
may
run
i
think
you
are
wise
in
that
loketh
karara
said
but
the
uneasiness
had
grown
in
ross
alien
powers
out
of
a
mountain
heart
passed
from
one
lord
to
another
and
on
the
other
hand
the
rovers
sudden
magic
in
turn
lending
their
ships
wings
the
two
facts
balanced
in
an
odd
way
back
on
terra
there
had
been
those
sudden
and
unaccountable
jumps
in
technical
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
jumps
which
had
set
in
action
the
whole
time
travel
service
of
which
he
had
become
a
part
and
these
jumps
had
not
been
the
result
of
normal
research
they
had
come
from
the
looting
of
derelict
spaceships
wrecked
on
his
world
in
the
far
past
could
driblets
of
the
same
stellar
knowledge
have
been
here
deliberately
fed
to
warring
communities
he
asked
loketh
about
the
possibility
of
explorers
but
to
the
hawaikan
that
was
a
totally
foreign
conception
the
stars
for
loketh
were
the
doorways
and
windows
of
the
shades
and
he
treated
the
suggestion
of
space
travel
as
perhaps
natural
to
those
specters
but
certainly
not
for
beings
like
himself
there
was
no
hint
that
hawaika
had
been
openly
visited
by
a
galactic
ship
though
that
did
not
bar
such
landings
the
planet
was
ross
thought
thinly
populated
whole
sections
of
the
interiors
of
the
larger
islands
were
wilderness
and
this
world
must
be
in
the
same
state
of
only
partial
occupation
as
his
own
earth
had
been
in
the
bronze
age
when
tribes
on
the
march
had
fanned
out
into
virgin
wilderness
great
forests
and
steppes
unwalked
by
man
before
their
coming
now
as
he
balanced
in
the
canoe
and
tried
to
keep
his
mind
off
the
queasiness
in
his
middle
and
the
insecurity
of
the
one
thickness
of
hide
stretched
over
a
bone
framework
which
made
up
the
craft
between
his
person
and
the
water
ross
still
mulled
over
what
might
be
true
had
the
galactic
invaders
for
their
own
purposes
begun
to
meddle
here
leaking
weapons
or
tools
to
upset
what
must
be
a
very
delicate
balance
of
power
why
to
bring
on
a
conflict
which
would
occupy
the
native
population
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
or
depopulation
so
they
could
win
a
world
for
their
own
purposes
without
effort
or
risk
on
their
part
such
fishing
in
carefully
troubled
waters
fitted
very
well
with
the
persons
of
the
baldies
as
he
had
known
them
on
terra
and
he
could
not
set
aside
that
memory
of
this
very
coast
as
he
had
seen
it
through
the
peep
the
castle
in
ruins
tall
pylons
reaching
from
the
land
into
the
sea
was
this
the
beginning
of
that
change
which
would
end
in
the
hawaika
of
his
own
time
empty
of
intelligent
life
shattered
into
a
loose
network
of
islands
this
fog
is
strange
karara
words
startled
ross
to
return
to
the
here
and
now
the
haze
he
had
been
only
half
conscious
of
when
they
had
put
out
from
the
tiny
secret
bay
where
loketh
kept
his
boat
was
truly
a
fog
piling
up
in
soft
billows
and
cutting
down
visibility
with
speed
the
foanna
loketh
answer
was
sharp
a
recognition
of
danger
their
magic
they
hide
their
place
so
there
is
trouble
trouble
on
the
move
do
we
land
then
ross
did
not
ascribe
the
present
blotting
out
of
the
landscape
to
any
real
manipulation
of
nature
on
the
part
of
the
foanna
too
many
times
the
reputations
of
medicine
men
had
been
so
enhanced
by
coincidence
but
he
did
doubt
the
wisdom
of
trying
to
bore
ahead
blindly
in
this
murk
taua
and
can
guide
us
karara
reminded
him
throw
out
the
rope
ross
what
is
above
water
will
not
confuse
them
he
moved
cautiously
striving
to
adapt
his
actions
to
the
swing
of
the
boat
the
line
was
ready
coiled
to
hand
and
he
tossed
the
loose
end
overboard
to
feel
the
cord
jerk
taut
as
one
of
the
dolphins
caught
it
up
they
were
being
towed
now
though
both
paddlers
reinforced
the
forward
tug
with
their
efforts
the
curtain
gathering
above
the
surface
of
the
water
did
not
hamper
the
swimmers
beneath
its
surface
and
ross
felt
relief
he
turned
his
head
to
speak
to
loketh
how
near
are
we
the
mist
had
thickened
to
the
point
that
close
as
the
native
was
the
lines
of
his
body
blurred
his
clicking
answer
seemed
distorted
too
almost
as
if
the
fog
had
altered
not
only
his
form
but
his
personality
maybe
very
soon
now
we
must
see
the
sea
gate
before
we
are
sure
and
if
we
are
able
to
see
that
challenged
ross
the
sea
gate
is
above
and
below
the
water
those
who
obey
the
sea
maid
who
are
able
to
speak
thought
to
thought
will
find
it
if
we
can
not
but
they
were
never
to
reach
that
goal
karara
gave
warning
there
are
ships
about
ross
knew
that
the
dolphins
had
told
her
he
demanded
in
turn
what
kind
larger
much
larger
than
this
then
loketh
broke
in
a
rover
raider
three
of
them
ross
frowned
he
was
the
cripple
here
the
other
two
with
their
ability
to
communicate
with
the
dolphins
were
the
sighted
he
the
blind
and
he
resented
his
handicap
in
a
burst
of
bitterness
which
must
have
colored
his
tone
as
he
ordered
head
inshore
now
once
on
land
even
in
the
fog
he
felt
that
they
had
the
advantage
in
any
which
might
ensue
with
this
superior
enemy
force
but
afloat
he
was
helpless
and
vulnerable
a
state
ross
did
not
accept
easily
no
loketh
returned
as
sharply
there
is
no
place
to
land
along
the
cliff
we
are
between
two
of
the
ships
karara
reported
your
paddles
ross
schooled
his
voice
to
a
whisper
hold
them
use
them
let
the
dolphins
take
us
on
in
the
fog
if
we
make
no
sound
we
may
get
by
the
ships
right
karara
agreed
and
he
heard
an
assenting
grunt
from
loketh
they
were
moving
very
slowly
strong
as
the
dolphins
were
they
dared
not
expend
all
their
strength
on
towing
the
skiff
too
fast
ross
thought
furiously
perhaps
the
sea
could
be
their
way
of
escape
if
the
need
arose
he
had
no
idea
why
raiding
ships
were
moving
under
the
cover
of
fog
into
the
vicinity
of
the
foanna
citadel
but
the
terran
knowledge
of
tactics
led
him
to
guess
that
this
impending
visit
was
not
anticipated
by
the
foanna
nor
was
it
a
friendly
one
and
as
veteran
seamen
who
should
normally
be
wary
of
fog
as
thick
as
this
the
rovers
themselves
must
have
a
driving
reason
or
some
safeguard
which
led
them
here
now
but
dared
the
three
spill
out
of
their
boat
trust
to
their
swimming
ability
and
that
of
the
dolphins
and
invade
the
foanna
sea
gate
so
could
they
use
the
coming
rover
attack
as
a
cover
for
their
own
invasion
of
the
hold
ross
considered
that
the
odds
in
their
favor
were
beginning
to
look
better
he
whispered
his
idea
and
began
to
prepare
their
gear
the
boat
was
still
headed
for
the
shore
the
three
could
not
see
but
they
could
hear
sounds
out
of
the
white
cotton
wall
which
told
them
how
completely
they
were
boxed
in
by
the
raiders
creaks
whispers
noises
ross
could
not
readily
identify
carried
across
the
waves
before
leaving
the
cave
and
beginning
this
voyage
they
had
introduced
loketh
to
the
use
of
the
made
him
practice
in
the
depths
of
the
cave
pool
with
one
of
the
extras
drawn
through
the
gate
among
the
supplies
now
all
three
were
equipped
with
the
water
aid
and
they
could
be
gone
in
the
sea
before
the
trap
closed
the
supply
net
ross
warned
karara
a
moment
or
two
later
there
was
a
small
bump
against
the
skiff
at
his
left
hand
he
cautiously
raised
the
collection
of
containers
and
eased
the
burden
into
the
water
knowing
that
one
of
the
dolphins
would
take
charge
of
it
however
he
was
not
prepared
for
what
happened
next
under
him
the
boat
lurched
first
one
way
and
then
the
other
in
sharp
jerks
as
if
the
dolphins
were
trying
to
spill
them
into
the
sea
ross
heard
karara
call
out
her
voice
thin
and
frightened
taua
they
have
gone
mad
they
will
not
listen
the
boat
raced
in
a
zigag
path
loketh
clutched
at
ross
striving
to
steady
him
to
keep
the
boat
on
an
even
keel
the
foanna
just
as
loketh
cried
out
karara
plunged
over
the
prow
of
the
boat
whether
by
design
or
chance
ross
did
not
know
and
then
the
craft
whirled
about
smashed
side
against
side
with
a
dark
bulk
looming
out
of
the
fog
above
ross
heard
cries
knew
that
they
had
crashed
against
one
of
the
raiders
he
fought
to
retain
his
balance
but
he
had
been
knocked
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
against
loketh
and
they
struggled
together
unable
to
move
during
a
precious
second
or
two
out
of
the
air
over
their
heads
dropped
a
mass
of
waving
strands
which
enveloped
both
of
them
the
stuff
was
adhesive
slimy
ross
let
out
a
choked
cry
as
the
lines
tightened
about
his
arms
and
body
pinioning
him
those
tightened
wove
a
net
now
he
was
being
drawn
up
out
of
the
plunging
skiff
a
helpless
captive
his
flailing
legs
still
free
of
the
slimy
cords
struck
against
the
side
of
the
larger
ship
then
he
swung
in
over
the
well
of
the
deck
thudded
down
on
that
surface
with
bruising
force
unable
to
understand
anything
except
that
he
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
a
very
effective
device
loketh
dropped
beside
him
but
karara
was
not
brought
in
and
ross
held
to
that
small
bit
of
hope
had
she
made
it
to
freedom
by
dropping
into
the
water
before
the
rovers
netted
them
he
could
see
men
gathering
about
him
masked
and
distorted
in
the
fog
then
he
was
rolled
across
the
deck
boosted
over
the
edge
of
a
hatch
and
knew
an
instant
of
terror
as
he
fell
into
the
depth
below
how
long
was
he
unconscious
it
could
not
have
been
very
long
ross
decided
as
he
opened
his
eyes
on
dark
heard
the
small
sounds
of
the
ship
he
lay
very
still
trying
to
remember
to
gather
his
wits
before
he
tried
to
flex
his
arms
they
were
held
tight
to
his
sides
by
strands
which
no
longer
seemed
slimy
but
were
wrinkling
as
they
dried
there
was
an
odor
from
them
which
gagged
him
but
there
was
no
loosening
of
those
loops
in
spite
of
his
struggles
which
grew
more
intense
as
his
strength
returned
and
at
last
he
lay
panting
knowing
there
was
no
easy
way
of
escape
from
here
battle
test
babble
of
speech
cries
sounded
muffled
to
ross
made
a
mounting
clamor
on
the
deck
had
the
raiders
ship
been
boarded
was
it
now
under
attack
he
strove
to
hear
and
think
through
the
pain
in
his
head
the
bewilderment
loketh
he
was
certain
that
the
hawaikan
had
been
dumped
into
the
same
hold
the
only
answer
was
a
low
moan
a
mutter
from
the
dark
ross
began
to
inch
his
way
in
that
direction
he
was
no
seaman
but
during
that
progress
he
realized
that
the
ship
itself
had
changed
the
vibration
which
had
carried
through
the
planks
on
which
he
lay
was
stilled
some
engine
shut
off
one
portion
of
his
mind
put
that
into
familiar
terms
now
the
vessel
rocked
with
the
waves
did
not
bore
through
them
ross
brought
up
against
another
body
loketh
ahhhhh
the
fire
the
fire
the
answer
held
no
meaning
for
the
terran
it
burns
in
my
head
the
fire
the
rocking
of
the
ship
rolled
ross
away
from
his
fellow
prisoner
toward
the
opposite
side
of
the
hold
there
was
a
roar
of
voice
bull
strong
above
the
noise
on
deck
then
the
sound
of
feet
back
and
forth
there
the
fire
ahhh
loketh
voice
rose
to
a
scream
ross
was
now
wedged
between
two
abutments
he
could
not
see
and
from
which
his
best
efforts
could
not
free
him
the
pitching
of
the
ship
was
more
pronounced
remembering
the
two
vessels
he
had
seen
pounded
to
bits
on
the
reef
ross
wondered
if
the
same
doom
loomed
for
this
one
but
that
disaster
had
occurred
during
a
storm
and
save
for
the
fog
this
had
been
a
calm
night
the
sea
untroubled
unless
maybe
the
shaking
his
body
had
received
during
the
past
few
moments
had
sharpened
his
thinking
unless
the
foanna
had
their
own
means
of
protection
at
the
sea
gate
and
this
was
the
result
the
dolphins
what
had
made
and
taua
react
as
they
did
and
if
the
rover
ship
was
out
of
control
it
would
be
a
good
time
to
attempt
escape
loketh
ross
dared
to
call
louder
loketh
he
struggled
against
the
drying
strands
which
bound
him
from
shoulder
to
mid
thigh
there
was
no
give
in
them
more
sounds
from
the
upper
deck
now
the
ship
was
answering
to
direction
again
the
terran
heard
sounds
he
could
not
identify
and
the
ship
no
longer
rocked
so
violently
loketh
moaned
as
far
as
ross
could
judge
they
were
heading
out
to
sea
loketh
he
wanted
information
he
must
have
it
to
be
so
ignorant
of
what
was
going
on
was
unbearable
frustration
if
they
were
now
prisoners
in
a
ship
leaving
the
island
behind
the
threat
of
that
was
enough
to
set
ross
struggling
with
his
bonds
until
he
lay
panting
with
exhaustion
rossss
only
a
hawaikan
could
make
that
name
a
hiss
here
loketh
but
of
course
it
was
loketh
i
am
here
the
other
voice
sounded
oddly
weak
as
if
it
issued
from
a
man
drained
by
a
long
illness
what
happened
to
you
ross
demanded
the
fire
the
fire
in
my
head
eating
eating
loketh
reply
came
with
long
pauses
between
the
words
the
terran
was
puzzled
what
fire
loketh
had
certainly
reacted
to
something
beyond
the
unceremonious
handling
they
had
received
as
captives
this
whole
ship
had
reacted
and
the
dolphins
but
what
fire
was
loketh
talking
about
i
did
not
feel
anything
he
stated
to
himself
as
well
as
to
the
hawaikan
nothing
burning
in
your
head
so
you
could
not
think
no
it
must
have
been
the
foanna
magic
fire
eating
so
that
a
man
is
nothing
only
that
which
fire
feeds
upon
karara
ross
thoughts
flashed
back
to
those
few
seconds
when
the
dolphins
had
seemed
to
go
crazy
karara
had
then
called
out
something
about
the
foanna
so
the
dolphins
must
have
felt
this
and
karara
and
loketh
whatever
was
but
why
not
ross
murdock
karara
possessed
an
extra
undefinable
sense
which
gave
her
contact
with
the
dolphins
loketh
had
a
mind
which
those
could
read
in
turn
but
such
communication
was
closed
to
ross
at
first
that
realization
carried
with
it
a
feeling
of
shame
and
loss
that
he
did
not
have
what
these
others
possessed
a
subtle
power
beyond
the
body
a
part
of
mind
was
humbling
just
as
he
had
felt
shut
out
and
crippled
when
he
had
been
forced
to
use
the
analyzer
instead
of
the
sense
the
others
had
so
did
he
suffer
now
then
ross
laughed
shortly
all
right
sometimes
insensitivity
could
be
a
defense
as
it
had
at
the
sea
gate
suppose
his
lack
could
also
be
a
weapon
he
had
not
been
knocked
out
as
the
others
appeared
to
be
but
for
the
bad
luck
of
having
been
captured
before
the
raiders
had
succumbed
ross
could
perhaps
have
been
master
of
this
ship
by
now
he
did
not
laugh
now
he
smiled
sardonically
at
his
own
grandiose
reaction
no
use
thinking
about
what
might
have
been
just
file
this
fact
for
future
reference
a
creaking
overhead
heralded
the
opening
of
the
hatch
light
lanced
down
into
the
cubby
and
a
figure
swung
over
and
down
a
side
ladder
coming
to
stand
over
ross
feet
apart
for
balancing
accommodating
to
the
swing
of
the
vessel
with
the
ease
of
long
practice
thus
ross
came
face
to
face
with
his
first
representative
of
the
third
party
in
the
hawaikan
tangle
of
power
a
rover
the
seaman
was
tall
with
a
heavier
development
of
shoulder
and
upper
arms
than
the
landsmen
like
the
guards
he
wore
supple
armor
but
this
had
been
colored
or
overlaid
with
a
pearly
hue
in
which
other
tints
wove
opaline
lines
his
head
was
bare
except
for
a
broad
scaled
band
running
from
the
nape
of
his
neck
to
the
of
his
forehead
a
band
supporting
a
sharply
serrated
crest
not
unlike
the
erect
fin
of
some
terran
fish
now
as
he
stood
fists
planted
on
hips
the
rover
presented
a
formidable
figure
and
ross
recognized
in
him
the
air
of
command
this
must
be
one
of
the
ship
officers
dark
eyes
surveyed
ross
with
interest
the
light
from
the
deck
focused
directly
across
the
raider
shoulder
to
catch
the
terran
in
its
full
glare
and
ross
fought
the
need
for
squinting
but
he
tried
to
give
back
stare
for
stare
confidence
for
on
terra
in
the
past
more
than
one
adventurer
life
had
been
saved
simply
because
he
had
the
will
and
nerve
enough
to
face
his
captors
without
any
display
of
anxiety
such
bravado
might
not
hold
here
and
now
but
it
was
the
only
weapon
ross
had
to
hand
and
he
used
it
you
the
rover
broke
the
silence
first
you
are
not
of
the
foanna
he
paused
as
if
waiting
an
answer
denial
or
protest
ross
provided
neither
no
not
of
the
foanna
nor
of
the
scum
of
the
coast
either
again
a
pause
so
what
manner
of
fish
has
come
to
the
net
of
torgul
he
called
an
order
aloft
a
rope
here
we
have
this
fish
and
its
fellow
out
loketh
and
ross
were
jerked
up
to
the
outer
deck
dumped
into
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
seamen
the
hawaikan
was
left
to
lie
but
at
a
gesture
from
the
officer
ross
was
set
on
his
feet
he
could
see
the
nature
of
his
bonds
now
a
network
of
dull
gray
strands
shriveled
and
stinking
but
not
giving
in
the
least
when
he
made
another
try
at
moving
his
arms
ho
the
officer
grinned
this
fish
does
not
like
the
net
you
have
teeth
fish
use
them
slash
yourself
free
a
murmur
of
applause
from
the
crew
answered
that
mild
taunt
ross
thought
it
time
for
a
countermove
i
see
you
do
not
come
too
close
to
those
teeth
he
used
the
most
defiant
words
his
limited
hawaikan
vocabulary
offered
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
and
then
the
officer
clapped
his
hands
together
with
a
sharp
explosion
of
sound
you
would
use
your
teeth
fish
he
asked
and
his
tone
could
be
a
warning
this
was
going
it
blind
with
a
vengeance
but
ross
took
the
next
leap
in
the
dark
he
had
the
feeling
which
often
came
to
him
in
tight
quarters
that
he
was
being
supplied
from
some
hard
core
of
endurance
and
determination
far
within
him
with
the
right
words
the
fortunate
guess
on
which
one
of
you
he
drew
his
lips
tight
displaying
those
same
teeth
wondering
for
one
startled
moment
if
he
should
take
the
query
literally
vistur
vistur
more
than
one
voice
called
one
of
the
crew
took
a
step
or
two
forward
like
torgul
he
was
tall
and
heavy
his
arms
well
muscled
there
were
scars
on
his
forearms
the
seam
of
one
up
his
jaw
he
looked
what
he
was
a
very
tough
fighting
man
one
who
was
judged
so
by
peers
as
seasoned
and
dangerous
do
you
choose
to
prove
your
words
on
vistur
fish
again
the
officer
had
a
formal
note
in
his
question
as
if
this
was
all
part
of
some
ceremony
if
he
meets
with
me
as
he
stands
no
other
weapons
ross
flashed
back
now
he
had
another
reaction
from
them
there
were
some
jeers
a
sprinkling
of
threats
as
to
vistur
intentions
but
ross
caught
also
the
fact
that
two
or
three
of
them
had
gone
silent
and
were
eyeing
him
in
a
new
and
more
searching
fashion
and
that
torgul
was
one
of
those
vistur
laughed
well
said
fish
so
shall
it
be
torgul
hand
came
out
palm
up
facing
ross
in
its
hollow
was
a
small
object
the
terran
could
not
see
clearly
a
new
weapon
only
the
officer
made
no
move
to
touch
it
to
ross
the
hand
merely
moved
in
a
series
of
waves
in
then
the
rover
spoke
he
carries
no
unlawful
magic
vistur
nodded
he
no
foanna
and
what
need
have
i
to
fear
the
spells
of
any
coast
crawler
i
am
vistur
again
the
yells
of
his
supporters
arose
in
hearty
answer
the
statement
held
more
complete
and
quiet
confidence
than
any
wordy
boast
and
i
am
ross
murdock
the
terran
matched
the
rover
tone
for
tone
but
does
a
fish
swim
with
its
fins
bound
to
its
sides
or
does
vistur
fear
a
free
fish
too
greatly
to
face
one
his
taunt
brought
the
result
ross
wanted
the
ties
were
cut
from
behind
to
flutter
down
as
withered
useless
strings
ross
flexed
his
arms
tight
as
those
thongs
had
been
they
had
not
constricted
circulation
and
he
was
ready
to
meet
vistur
the
terran
did
not
doubt
that
the
rover
champion
was
a
formidable
fighter
but
he
had
not
had
the
advantage
of
going
through
one
of
the
agent
training
courses
every
trick
of
unarmed
fighting
known
on
his
own
world
had
been
pounded
into
ross
long
ago
his
hands
and
feet
could
be
as
deadly
weapons
as
any
sword
or
gun
provided
he
could
get
close
enough
to
use
them
properly
vistur
stripped
off
his
weapon
belt
put
to
one
side
his
helmet
showing
that
under
it
his
hair
was
plaited
into
a
braid
coiled
about
the
crown
of
his
head
to
provide
what
must
be
an
extra
padding
for
that
strangely
narrowed
helm
then
he
peeled
off
his
armor
peeled
it
literally
indeed
catching
the
lower
edge
of
the
scaled
covering
with
his
hands
and
pulling
it
up
and
over
his
head
and
shoulders
as
one
might
skin
off
a
knitted
garment
now
he
stood
facing
ross
wearing
little
more
than
the
terran
swimming
trunks
ross
had
dropped
his
belt
and
he
moved
into
the
circle
the
crew
had
made
from
above
came
a
strong
light
centering
from
a
point
on
the
mainmast
and
giving
him
good
sight
of
his
opponent
vistur
was
being
urged
to
make
a
quick
end
of
the
reckless
challenger
his
supporters
shouting
directions
and
encouragement
but
if
the
rover
had
confidence
he
also
possessed
the
more
intelligent
and
valuable
trait
of
caution
in
the
face
of
the
unknown
he
outweighed
apparently
outmatched
ross
but
he
did
not
rush
in
rashly
as
his
backers
wished
him
to
they
circled
ross
studying
every
move
of
the
rover
muscles
every
slight
fraction
of
change
in
the
other
balance
there
would
be
something
to
telegraph
an
attack
from
the
other
for
he
intended
to
fight
purely
in
defense
the
charge
came
at
last
as
the
crew
grew
impatient
and
yelled
their
impatience
to
see
the
prisoner
taught
a
lesson
but
ross
did
not
believe
it
was
that
which
sent
vistur
at
him
the
hawaikan
simply
thought
he
knew
the
best
way
to
take
the
terran
ross
ducked
so
that
a
hammer
blow
merely
grazed
him
but
the
stiffened
hand
swept
sidewise
in
a
judo
chop
vistur
gave
a
whooping
cry
and
went
to
his
knees
and
ross
swung
again
sending
the
rover
flat
to
the
deck
it
had
been
quick
but
not
so
vicious
as
it
might
have
been
the
terran
had
no
desire
to
kill
or
even
disable
vistur
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
his
victim
would
carry
a
couple
of
aching
bruises
and
perhaps
a
hearty
respect
for
a
new
mode
of
fighting
from
this
encounter
he
could
have
as
easily
been
dead
had
either
of
those
blows
landed
other
than
where
ross
chose
to
plant
them
ahhhh
the
terran
swung
around
setting
his
back
to
the
foot
of
the
mast
had
he
guessed
wrong
with
their
chosen
champion
down
would
the
crew
now
rush
him
he
had
gambled
on
the
element
of
fair
play
which
existed
in
a
primitive
terran
warrior
society
after
a
challenge
but
he
could
be
wrong
ross
waited
tense
just
let
one
of
them
pull
a
weapon
and
it
could
be
his
end
two
of
them
were
aiding
vistur
to
his
feet
the
rover
breath
whistled
in
and
out
of
him
with
that
same
whooping
and
both
of
his
hands
rose
unsteadily
to
his
chest
the
majority
of
his
fellows
stared
from
him
to
the
slighter
terran
as
if
unable
to
believe
the
evidence
of
their
eyes
torgul
gathered
up
from
the
deck
the
belt
and
ross
had
shed
in
preparation
for
the
fight
he
turned
the
belt
around
over
his
forearm
until
the
empty
knife
sheath
was
uppermost
one
of
the
crew
came
forward
and
slammed
back
into
its
proper
place
the
long
diver
knife
which
had
been
there
when
ross
was
captured
then
the
rover
offered
belt
and
to
ross
the
terran
relaxed
his
gamble
had
paid
off
by
the
present
signs
he
had
won
his
freedom
and
my
swordsman
as
he
buckled
on
the
belt
ross
nodded
at
loketh
still
lying
bound
where
they
had
pushed
him
at
the
beginning
of
the
fight
he
is
sworn
to
you
torgul
asked
he
is
loose
the
coast
rat
then
the
rover
ordered
now
tell
me
stranger
what
manner
of
man
are
you
do
you
come
from
the
foanna
after
all
you
have
a
magic
which
is
not
our
magic
since
the
stone
of
phutka
did
not
reveal
it
on
you
are
you
from
the
shades
his
fingers
moved
in
the
same
sign
loketh
had
once
made
before
karara
ross
gave
his
chosen
explanation
i
am
from
the
sea
captain
as
for
the
foanna
they
are
no
friend
to
me
since
they
hold
captive
in
their
keep
one
who
is
my
torgul
stared
him
up
and
down
you
say
you
are
from
the
sea
i
have
been
a
rover
since
i
was
able
to
stumble
on
my
two
feet
across
a
deck
after
the
manner
and
custom
of
my
people
yet
i
have
never
seen
your
like
before
perhaps
your
coming
means
ill
to
me
and
mine
but
by
the
law
of
battle
you
have
won
your
freedom
on
this
ship
i
swear
to
you
however
stranger
that
if
ill
comes
from
you
then
the
law
will
not
hold
and
you
shall
match
your
magic
against
the
strength
of
phutka
that
you
shall
discover
is
another
thing
altogether
i
will
swear
any
oath
you
desire
of
me
captain
that
i
have
no
ill
toward
you
and
yours
there
is
only
one
wish
i
hold
to
bring
him
whom
i
seek
out
from
the
foanna
hold
before
they
make
him
witches
meat
that
will
be
a
task
worthy
of
any
magic
you
may
be
able
to
summon
stranger
we
have
tasted
this
night
of
the
power
of
the
sea
gate
though
we
went
in
under
the
will
of
phutka
we
were
as
weeds
whirled
about
on
the
waves
who
enters
that
gate
must
have
more
force
than
any
we
now
know
and
you
too
then
have
a
score
to
settle
with
the
foanna
we
have
a
score
against
the
foanna
or
against
their
magic
torgul
admitted
three
ships
one
island
fairing
are
gone
as
if
they
never
were
and
those
who
went
with
them
are
of
our
there
is
the
work
of
the
shadow
stretching
dark
and
heavy
across
the
sea
new
come
into
these
waters
but
there
remains
nothing
we
can
do
this
night
we
have
been
lucky
to
win
to
sea
again
now
stranger
what
shall
we
do
with
you
or
will
you
take
to
the
sea
again
since
you
name
it
as
home
not
here
ross
countered
swiftly
he
must
gain
some
idea
of
where
they
might
be
in
relation
to
the
island
how
far
from
its
shore
karara
and
the
dolphins
what
had
happened
to
them
you
took
no
other
prisoners
ross
had
to
ask
there
were
more
of
you
torgul
countered
yes
no
need
to
say
how
many
ross
decided
we
saw
no
others
you
all
of
you
the
captain
rounded
on
the
crew
get
about
your
work
we
must
raise
kyn
add
by
morning
and
report
to
the
council
he
walked
away
and
ross
determined
to
learn
all
he
could
followed
him
into
the
stern
cabin
here
again
the
terran
was
faced
with
barbaric
splendor
in
carvings
hangings
a
wealth
of
plate
and
furnishing
not
too
different
from
the
display
he
had
seen
in
the
wreckers
castle
as
ross
hesitated
just
within
the
doorway
torgul
glanced
back
at
him
you
have
your
life
and
that
of
your
man
stranger
do
not
ask
more
of
me
unless
you
have
that
within
your
hands
to
enforce
the
asking
i
want
nothing
save
to
be
returned
to
where
you
took
me
captain
torgul
smiled
grimly
you
are
the
sea
you
yourself
said
that
the
sea
is
wide
but
it
is
all
one
through
it
you
must
have
your
own
paths
take
any
you
choose
but
i
do
not
risk
my
ship
again
into
what
lies
in
wait
before
the
gates
of
the
foanna
where
do
you
go
then
captain
to
kyn
add
you
have
your
own
choice
stranger
the
sea
or
our
fairing
there
would
be
no
way
of
changing
the
rover
decision
ross
thought
and
even
with
the
he
could
not
swim
back
to
where
he
had
been
taken
there
were
no
guideposts
in
the
sea
but
a
longer
acquaintance
with
torgul
might
be
helpful
kyn
add
then
captain
he
made
the
next
move
to
prove
equality
and
establish
himself
with
this
rover
seating
himself
at
the
table
as
one
who
had
the
right
to
share
the
captain
quarters
death
at
kyn
add
the
hour
was
close
to
dawn
again
and
a
need
for
sleep
weighted
eyelids
was
a
craving
as
strong
as
hunger
still
restlessness
had
brought
him
on
deck
sent
him
to
pacing
alert
to
this
vessel
and
its
crew
he
had
seen
the
ships
of
the
terran
bronze
age
traders
small
craft
compared
to
those
of
his
own
time
depending
upon
oarsmen
when
the
wind
failed
their
sails
creeping
along
coasts
rather
than
venturing
too
far
into
dangerous
seas
sometimes
even
tying
up
at
the
shore
each
night
there
had
been
other
ships
leaner
hardier
those
had
plunged
into
the
unknown
touching
lands
beyond
the
sea
mists
sailed
and
oared
by
men
plagued
by
the
need
to
learn
what
lay
beyond
the
horizon
and
here
was
such
a
ship
taut
well
kept
larger
than
the
viking
longboats
ross
had
watched
on
the
tapes
of
the
project
collection
yet
most
like
those
terran
craft
the
prow
curved
up
in
a
mighty
bowsprit
where
was
the
carved
likeness
of
the
sea
dragon
ross
had
fought
in
the
hawaika
of
his
own
time
the
eyes
of
that
monster
flashed
with
a
regular
blink
of
light
which
the
terran
did
not
understand
was
it
a
signal
or
merely
a
device
to
threaten
a
possible
enemy
there
were
sails
now
furled
as
this
ship
bored
on
answering
to
the
steady
throb
of
what
could
only
be
an
engine
and
his
puzzlement
held
a
viking
longboat
powered
by
motor
the
mixture
was
incongruous
the
crew
were
uniform
as
to
face
all
of
them
wore
the
flexible
pearly
armor
the
helmets
though
there
were
individual
differences
in
ornaments
and
the
choice
of
weapons
the
majority
of
the
men
did
carry
swords
though
those
were
broader
and
heavier
than
those
the
terran
had
seen
ashore
but
several
had
axes
with
heads
whose
points
curved
so
far
back
that
they
nearly
met
to
form
a
circle
spaced
at
regular
intervals
on
deck
were
boxlike
objects
fronting
what
resembled
gun
ports
and
smaller
ones
of
the
same
type
were
on
the
raised
deck
at
the
stern
and
mounted
in
the
prow
their
muzzles
if
the
square
fronts
might
be
deemed
muzzles
flanking
the
blinking
dragon
head
catapults
of
some
type
ross
wondered
rosss
his
name
was
given
the
hiss
loketh
used
but
it
was
not
the
wrecker
youth
who
joined
him
now
at
the
stern
of
the
ship
ho
that
was
strong
magic
that
fighting
knowledge
of
yours
vistur
rubbed
his
chest
reminiscently
you
have
big
magic
sea
man
but
then
you
serve
the
maid
do
you
not
your
swordsman
has
told
us
that
even
the
great
fish
understand
and
obey
her
some
fish
qualified
ross
such
fish
as
that
perhaps
vistur
pointed
to
the
curling
wake
of
foam
startled
ross
stared
in
that
direction
torgul
command
was
the
centermost
in
a
trio
of
ships
and
those
cruised
in
a
line
leaving
three
trails
of
troubled
wave
behind
them
coming
up
now
to
port
in
the
comparative
calm
between
two
wakes
was
a
dark
object
in
the
limited
light
ross
could
be
sure
of
nothing
save
that
it
trailed
the
ships
appeared
to
rest
on
or
only
lightly
in
the
water
and
that
its
speed
was
less
than
that
of
the
vessels
it
doggedly
pursued
a
fish
that
ross
asked
watch
vistur
ordered
but
the
hawaikan
sight
must
have
been
keener
than
the
terran
had
there
been
a
quick
movement
back
there
ross
could
not
be
sure
what
happened
he
turned
to
vistur
for
enlightenment
as
a
salkar
it
leaps
now
and
then
above
the
surface
but
that
is
no
salkar
unless
ross
you
who
say
you
are
from
the
sea
have
servants
unlike
any
finned
one
we
have
drawn
in
by
net
or
line
before
this
day
the
dolphins
could
or
taua
or
both
be
in
steady
pursuit
of
the
ships
but
karara
ross
leaned
against
the
rail
stared
until
his
eyes
began
to
water
from
the
strain
of
trying
to
make
out
the
nature
of
the
black
blot
no
use
the
distance
was
too
great
he
brought
his
fist
down
against
the
wood
trying
to
control
his
impatience
more
than
half
of
him
wanted
to
burst
into
torgul
quarters
demand
that
the
captain
bring
the
ship
about
to
pick
up
or
contact
that
trailer
or
trailers
yours
again
vistur
asked
ross
had
tight
rein
on
himself
now
i
do
not
know
it
could
well
be
it
could
well
be
also
that
the
smart
thing
would
be
to
encourage
the
rovers
to
believe
that
he
had
a
force
of
sea
dwellers
much
larger
than
the
four
time
castaways
the
leader
of
an
army
or
a
navy
had
more
prestige
in
any
truce
discussion
than
a
member
of
a
lost
scouting
party
but
the
thought
that
the
dolphins
could
be
trailing
held
both
promise
and
worry
promise
of
allies
and
worry
over
what
had
happened
to
karara
had
she
too
disappeared
after
ashe
into
the
hold
of
the
foanna
the
day
did
not
continue
to
lighten
though
there
was
no
cottony
mist
as
had
enclosed
them
the
night
before
there
was
an
odd
muting
of
sea
and
sky
limiting
vision
shortly
ross
was
unable
to
sight
the
follower
or
followers
even
vistur
admitted
he
had
lost
visual
contact
had
the
blot
been
hopelessly
outdistanced
or
was
it
still
dogging
the
wakes
of
the
rover
ships
ross
shared
the
morning
meal
with
captain
torgul
a
round
of
leathery
substance
with
a
salty
meaty
flavor
and
a
thick
mixture
of
what
might
be
native
fruit
reduced
to
a
tart
paste
once
before
he
had
tasted
alien
food
when
in
the
derelict
spaceship
it
had
meant
eat
or
starve
and
this
was
a
like
circumstance
since
their
emergency
ration
supplies
had
been
lost
in
the
net
but
though
he
was
apprehensive
no
ill
effects
followed
torgul
had
been
uncommunicative
earlier
now
he
was
looser
of
tongue
volunteering
that
they
were
almost
to
their
port
the
fairing
of
kyn
add
the
terran
had
no
idea
how
far
he
might
question
the
hawaikan
yet
the
fuller
his
information
the
better
he
discovered
that
torgul
appeared
willing
to
accept
ross
statement
that
he
was
from
a
distant
part
of
the
sea
and
that
local
customs
differed
from
those
he
knew
living
on
and
by
the
sea
the
rovers
were
adaptive
with
a
highly
flexible
if
organization
of
each
of
these
had
control
over
certain
islands
which
served
them
as
fairings
ports
for
refitting
and
anchorage
between
voyages
usually
ruggedly
wooded
where
the
sea
people
could
find
the
raw
material
for
their
ships
colonies
of
clans
took
to
the
sea
not
in
the
slim
swift
cruisers
like
the
ship
ross
was
now
on
but
in
larger
deeper
vessels
providing
living
quarters
and
warehouses
afloat
they
lived
by
trade
and
raiding
spending
only
a
portion
of
the
year
ashore
to
grow
crops
on
their
fairing
islands
and
indulge
in
some
manufacture
of
articles
the
inhabitants
of
the
larger
and
more
heavily
populated
islands
were
not
able
to
duplicate
their
main
article
of
commerce
was
however
a
creature
whose
supple
and
hide
formed
their
defensive
armor
and
served
manifold
other
uses
this
could
only
be
hunted
by
men
trained
and
fearless
enough
to
brave
more
than
one
danger
torgul
did
not
explain
in
detail
and
a
cargo
of
such
skins
brought
enough
in
trade
to
keep
a
for
a
year
there
was
warfare
among
them
rival
clans
tried
to
jump
each
hunting
territories
raid
fairings
but
until
the
immediate
past
ross
gathered
such
encounters
were
relatively
bloodless
affairs
depending
more
upon
craft
and
skillful
planning
to
reduce
the
enemy
to
a
position
of
disadvantage
in
which
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
defeat
rather
than
ruthless
battle
of
no
quarter
the
wrecker
lords
were
always
considered
fair
game
and
there
was
no
finesse
in
rover
raids
upon
them
those
were
conducted
with
a
determination
to
strike
hard
at
a
foe
however
within
the
past
year
there
had
been
several
raids
on
fairings
with
the
same
result
of
a
foray
on
a
wrecker
port
and
since
all
the
denied
the
tactics
which
had
finished
those
rover
holdings
the
seafarers
were
divided
in
their
opinion
as
to
whether
the
murderous
raids
were
the
work
of
wreckers
suddenly
acting
out
of
character
and
taking
to
the
sea
to
bring
war
back
to
their
enemies
or
whether
there
was
a
rogue
fleet
moving
against
their
own
kind
for
some
purpose
no
rover
could
yet
guess
and
you
believe
ross
asked
as
torgul
finished
his
résumé
of
the
new
dangers
besetting
his
people
torgul
hand
its
long
slender
fingers
spidery
to
terran
eyes
rubbed
back
and
forth
across
his
chin
before
he
answered
it
is
very
hard
for
one
who
has
fought
them
long
to
believe
that
suddenly
those
shore
rats
are
entrusting
themselves
to
the
waves
venturing
out
to
stir
us
with
their
swords
one
does
not
descend
into
the
depths
to
kick
a
salkar
in
the
rump
not
if
one
still
has
his
wits
safely
encased
under
his
skull
braid
as
for
a
rogue
fleet
what
would
turn
brother
against
brother
to
the
extent
of
slaying
children
and
women
raiding
for
a
wife
yes
that
is
common
among
our
youth
and
there
have
been
killings
over
such
matters
but
not
the
killing
of
a
woman
never
of
a
child
we
are
a
people
who
have
never
as
many
women
as
there
are
men
who
wish
to
bring
them
into
the
home
cabin
and
no
clan
has
as
many
children
as
they
hope
the
shades
will
send
them
then
who
when
torgul
did
not
answer
at
once
ross
glanced
at
the
captain
and
what
the
terran
thought
he
saw
showing
for
an
instant
in
the
other
eyes
was
a
revelation
of
danger
so
much
so
that
he
blurted
out
you
think
that
i
we
you
have
named
yourself
of
the
sea
stranger
and
you
have
magic
which
is
not
ours
tell
me
this
in
truth
could
you
not
have
killed
vistur
easily
with
those
two
blows
if
you
had
wished
it
ross
took
the
bold
course
yes
but
i
did
not
my
people
kill
no
more
wantonly
than
yours
the
coast
rats
i
know
and
the
foanna
as
well
as
any
man
may
know
their
kind
and
ways
and
my
people
but
you
i
do
not
know
sea
stranger
and
i
say
to
you
as
i
have
said
before
make
me
regret
that
i
suffered
you
to
claim
battle
rights
and
i
shall
speedily
correct
that
mistake
captain
that
cry
had
come
from
the
cabin
door
behind
ross
torgul
was
on
his
feet
with
the
swift
movements
of
a
man
called
many
times
in
the
past
for
an
instant
response
to
emergency
the
terran
was
close
on
the
rover
heels
as
they
reached
the
deck
a
cluster
of
crewmen
gathered
on
the
port
side
near
the
narrow
bow
that
odd
misty
quality
this
day
held
provided
a
murk
hard
to
pierce
but
the
men
were
gesturing
at
a
object
rolling
with
the
waves
that
was
near
enough
for
even
ross
to
be
able
to
distinguish
a
small
boat
akin
to
the
one
in
which
he
karara
and
loketh
had
dared
the
sea
gate
of
the
foanna
torgul
took
up
a
great
curved
shell
hanging
by
a
thong
on
the
mainmast
setting
its
narrow
end
to
his
lips
he
blew
a
weird
booming
note
like
the
coughing
of
a
sea
monster
carried
over
the
waves
but
there
was
no
answer
from
the
drifting
boat
no
sign
it
carried
any
passengers
hou
hou
hou
torgul
signal
was
by
shell
calls
from
the
other
two
cruisers
heave
to
the
captain
ordered
wakti
zimmon
yoana
out
and
bring
that
in
three
of
the
crew
leaped
to
the
railing
poised
there
for
a
moment
and
then
dived
almost
as
one
into
the
water
a
rope
end
was
thrown
caught
by
one
of
them
and
then
they
swam
with
powerful
strokes
toward
the
drifting
boat
once
the
rope
was
made
fast
the
small
craft
was
drawn
toward
torgul
command
the
crewmen
swimming
beside
it
ross
longed
to
know
the
reason
for
the
tense
expectancy
of
the
men
around
him
it
was
apparent
the
skiff
had
some
ominous
meaning
for
them
ross
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
body
huddled
within
the
craft
under
orders
a
sling
was
dropped
to
rise
weighted
with
a
passenger
the
terran
was
shouldered
back
from
the
rail
as
the
limp
body
was
hurried
into
the
captain
cabin
several
crewmen
slid
down
to
make
an
examination
of
the
boat
itself
their
heads
came
up
their
eyes
searched
along
the
rail
and
centered
on
ross
the
hostility
was
so
open
the
terran
braced
himself
to
meet
those
cold
stares
as
he
would
a
rush
from
a
challenger
a
slight
sound
behind
sent
ross
leaping
to
the
right
wanting
to
get
his
back
against
solid
protection
loketh
came
up
his
limp
making
him
awkward
so
that
he
clutched
at
the
rail
for
support
in
his
other
hand
was
one
of
the
hooked
swords
bared
and
ready
get
the
murderers
someone
in
the
back
line
of
the
massing
crew
yipped
that
ross
drew
his
diver
knife
shaken
at
this
sudden
change
in
the
attitude
he
was
warily
on
the
defensive
loketh
was
beside
him
now
and
the
hawaikan
nodded
to
the
sea
better
go
there
he
cried
over
before
they
try
to
gut
you
kill
the
word
shrilled
into
a
roar
from
the
rovers
they
started
up
the
deck
toward
ross
and
loketh
then
someone
leaped
between
and
vistur
fronted
his
own
comrades
stand
away
one
of
the
others
ran
forward
thrusting
at
the
tall
rover
with
a
stiffened
arm
to
fend
him
out
of
their
path
vistur
rolled
a
shoulder
sending
the
fellow
shunting
away
he
went
down
while
two
more
unable
to
halt
thudded
on
him
vistur
stamped
on
an
outstretched
hand
and
sent
a
sword
spinning
what
goes
here
torgul
demand
was
loud
enough
to
be
heard
it
stopped
a
few
of
the
crew
and
two
more
went
down
as
the
captain
struck
out
with
his
fists
then
he
was
facing
ross
and
the
chill
in
his
eyes
was
the
threat
the
others
had
voiced
i
told
you
sea
stranger
that
if
i
found
you
were
a
danger
to
me
or
mine
you
would
meet
the
justice
of
phutka
you
did
ross
returned
and
in
what
way
am
i
now
a
danger
captain
kyn
add
has
been
taken
by
those
who
are
not
wreckers
not
rovers
not
those
who
serve
the
foanna
but
strangers
out
of
the
sea
ross
could
only
stare
back
confused
and
then
the
full
force
of
his
danger
struck
home
who
those
raiding
sea
strangers
could
be
he
had
no
idea
but
that
he
was
now
condemned
out
of
his
own
mouth
was
true
and
he
realized
that
these
men
were
not
going
to
listen
to
any
argument
from
him
in
their
present
state
of
mind
the
growl
of
the
crew
was
that
of
a
hungry
animal
ross
saw
the
wisdom
in
loketh
choice
far
better
chance
the
open
sea
than
the
mob
before
them
but
his
time
for
choice
had
passed
out
of
nowhere
whirled
a
lacy
net
slapping
him
back
against
a
bulkhead
to
glue
him
there
ross
tried
to
twist
loose
got
his
head
around
in
time
to
see
loketh
scramble
to
the
top
of
the
rail
turn
as
if
to
launch
himself
at
the
men
speeding
for
the
now
helpless
terran
but
the
hawaikan
crippled
leg
failed
him
and
he
toppled
back
overside
no
again
torgul
shout
halted
the
crew
he
shall
take
the
black
curse
with
him
when
he
goes
to
meet
the
shadow
and
only
one
can
speak
that
curse
bring
him
helpless
reeling
under
their
blows
dragged
along
ross
was
thrown
into
the
captain
cabin
confronted
by
a
figure
braced
up
by
coverings
and
cushions
in
torgul
own
chair
a
woman
her
face
a
drawn
death
head
of
skin
pulled
tight
upon
bone
yet
a
fiery
inner
strength
holding
her
mind
above
the
suffering
of
her
body
looked
at
the
terran
with
narrowed
eyes
she
nursed
a
bandaged
arm
against
her
and
now
and
then
her
mouth
quivered
as
if
she
could
not
altogether
control
some
emotion
or
physical
pain
yours
is
the
cursing
lady
jazia
make
it
heavy
to
bear
for
him
as
his
kind
has
laid
the
burden
of
pain
and
remembering
on
all
of
us
she
brought
her
good
hand
up
to
her
mouth
wiping
its
back
across
her
lips
as
if
to
temper
their
quiver
and
all
the
time
her
eyes
held
upon
ross
why
do
you
bring
me
this
man
her
voice
was
strained
high
he
is
not
of
those
who
brought
the
shadow
to
kyn
add
what
torgul
began
and
then
schooled
his
voice
to
a
more
normal
tone
those
were
from
the
sea
he
was
gentle
in
his
questioning
they
came
out
of
the
sea
using
weapons
against
which
we
had
no
defense
she
nodded
yes
they
made
very
sure
that
only
the
dead
remained
but
i
had
gone
to
the
shrine
of
phutka
since
it
was
my
day
of
duty
and
phutka
power
threw
its
shade
over
me
so
i
did
not
die
but
i
saw
yes
i
saw
not
those
like
me
ross
dared
to
speak
to
her
directly
no
not
those
like
you
there
were
few
only
so
many
she
spread
out
her
five
fingers
and
they
were
all
of
one
like
as
if
born
in
one
birth
they
had
no
hair
on
their
heads
and
their
bodies
were
of
this
hue
she
plucked
at
one
of
the
coverings
they
had
heaped
around
her
it
was
a
mixture
ross
sucked
in
his
breath
and
torgul
was
fast
to
pounce
upon
the
understanding
he
read
in
the
terran
face
not
your
kind
but
still
you
know
them
i
know
them
ross
agreed
they
are
the
enemy
the
baldies
from
the
ancient
spaceships
that
wholly
alien
race
with
whom
he
had
once
fought
a
desperate
encounter
on
the
edge
of
an
unnamed
sea
in
the
far
past
of
his
own
world
the
galactic
voyagers
were
here
and
in
active
if
secret
conflict
with
the
natives
weapon
from
the
depths
jazia
told
her
story
with
an
attention
to
time
and
detail
which
amazed
ross
and
won
his
admiration
for
her
breed
she
had
witnessed
the
death
and
destruction
of
all
which
was
her
life
and
yet
she
had
the
wit
to
note
and
record
mentally
for
possible
future
use
all
that
she
had
been
able
to
see
of
the
raiders
they
had
come
out
of
the
sea
at
dawn
walking
with
supreme
confidence
and
lack
of
any
fear
axes
flung
when
they
did
not
reply
to
the
sentries
challenges
had
never
touched
them
and
a
bombardment
of
heavier
missiles
had
been
turned
aside
they
proved
invulnerable
to
any
weapon
the
rovers
had
men
who
made
suicidal
rushes
to
use
sword
or
battle
ax
had
fallen
before
they
were
in
striking
distance
under
spraying
tongues
of
fire
from
tubes
the
aliens
carried
rovers
were
not
fearful
or
easily
cowed
but
in
the
end
they
had
fled
from
the
five
invaders
gone
to
ground
in
their
halls
tried
to
reach
their
beached
ships
only
to
die
as
they
ran
and
hid
the
slaughter
had
been
remorseless
and
entire
leaving
jazia
in
the
hill
shrine
as
the
only
survivor
she
had
hidden
for
the
rest
of
the
day
seen
the
killing
of
a
few
fugitives
and
that
night
had
stolen
to
the
shore
launched
one
of
the
ship
boats
which
was
in
a
cove
well
away
from
the
main
harbor
of
the
fairing
heading
out
to
sea
in
hope
of
meeting
the
homing
cruisers
with
her
warning
they
stayed
there
on
the
island
ross
asked
that
point
of
her
story
puzzled
him
if
the
object
of
that
murderous
raid
had
been
only
to
stir
up
trouble
among
the
hawaikan
rovers
perhaps
turning
one
clan
against
the
other
as
he
had
deduced
when
he
had
listened
to
torgul
report
of
similar
happenings
then
the
star
men
should
have
withdrawn
as
soon
as
their
mission
was
complete
leaving
the
dead
to
call
for
vengeance
in
the
wrong
direction
there
would
be
no
reason
to
court
discovery
of
their
true
identity
by
lingering
when
the
boat
was
asea
there
were
still
lights
at
the
fairing
hall
and
they
were
not
our
lights
nor
did
the
dead
carry
them
she
said
slowly
what
have
those
to
fear
they
can
not
be
killed
if
they
are
still
there
that
we
can
put
to
the
test
torgul
replied
grimly
and
a
murmur
from
his
officers
bore
out
his
determination
and
lose
all
the
rest
of
you
ross
retorted
coldly
i
have
met
these
before
they
can
will
a
man
to
obey
them
look
you
he
slammed
his
left
hand
flat
on
the
table
the
ridges
of
scar
tissue
were
plain
against
his
tanned
skin
he
knew
no
better
way
of
driving
home
the
dangers
of
dealing
with
the
star
men
than
providing
this
graphic
example
i
held
my
own
hand
in
fire
so
that
the
hurt
of
it
would
work
against
their
pull
upon
my
thoughts
against
their
willing
that
i
come
and
be
easy
meat
for
their
butchering
jazia
fingers
flickered
out
smoothed
across
his
old
scars
lightly
as
she
gazed
into
his
eyes
this
too
is
true
she
said
slowly
for
it
was
also
pain
of
body
which
kept
me
from
their
last
snare
they
stood
by
the
hall
and
i
saw
prahad
okun
mosaji
come
out
to
them
to
be
killed
as
if
they
were
in
a
hold
net
and
were
drawn
and
there
was
that
which
called
me
also
so
that
i
would
go
to
them
though
i
called
upon
the
power
of
phutka
to
save
and
the
answer
to
that
plea
came
in
a
strange
way
for
i
fell
as
i
went
from
the
shrine
and
cut
my
arm
on
the
rocks
the
pain
of
that
hurt
was
as
a
knife
severing
the
net
then
i
crawled
for
the
wood
and
that
calling
did
not
come
again
if
you
know
so
much
about
them
tell
us
what
weapons
we
may
use
to
pull
them
down
that
demand
came
from
vistur
ross
shook
his
head
i
do
not
know
yet
jazia
mused
all
things
which
live
must
also
die
sooner
or
later
and
it
is
in
my
mind
that
these
have
also
a
fate
they
dread
and
fear
perhaps
we
may
find
and
use
it
they
came
from
the
sea
by
a
ship
then
ross
asked
she
shook
her
head
no
there
was
no
ship
they
came
walking
through
the
breaking
waves
as
if
they
had
followed
some
road
across
the
sea
bottom
a
sub
what
is
that
torgul
demanded
a
type
of
ship
which
goes
under
the
waves
not
through
them
carrying
air
within
its
hull
for
the
breathing
of
the
crew
torgul
eyes
narrowed
one
of
the
other
captains
who
had
been
summoned
from
the
two
companion
cruisers
gave
a
snort
of
disbelief
there
are
no
such
ships
he
began
to
be
silenced
by
a
gesture
from
torgul
we
know
of
no
such
ships
the
other
corrected
but
then
we
know
of
no
such
devices
as
jazia
saw
in
operation
either
how
does
one
war
upon
these
ships
ross
the
terran
hesitated
to
describe
to
men
who
knew
nothing
of
explosives
the
classic
way
of
dealing
with
a
sub
via
depth
charges
was
close
to
impossible
but
he
did
his
best
among
my
people
one
imprisons
in
a
container
a
great
power
then
the
container
is
dropped
near
the
sub
and
and
how
broke
in
the
skeptical
captain
do
you
know
where
such
a
ship
lies
can
you
see
it
through
the
water
in
a
way
not
see
but
hear
there
is
a
machine
which
makes
for
the
captain
of
the
ship
a
picture
of
where
the
sub
lies
or
moves
so
that
he
may
follow
its
course
then
when
he
is
near
enough
he
drops
the
container
and
the
power
breaks
free
to
also
break
apart
the
sub
yet
the
making
of
such
containers
and
the
imprisoning
of
the
power
within
them
torgul
said
this
is
the
result
of
a
knowledge
which
is
greater
than
any
save
the
foanna
may
possess
you
do
not
have
it
his
conclusion
was
half
statement
half
question
no
it
took
many
years
and
the
combined
knowledge
of
many
men
among
my
people
to
make
such
containers
such
a
listening
device
i
do
not
have
it
why
then
think
of
what
we
do
not
have
torgul
return
was
decisive
what
we
have
ross
head
came
up
he
was
listening
not
to
anything
in
that
cabin
but
to
a
sound
which
had
come
through
the
port
just
behind
his
head
there
it
had
come
again
he
was
on
his
feet
what
vistur
hand
hovered
over
the
ax
at
his
belt
ross
saw
their
gaze
centered
on
him
we
may
have
reinforcements
now
the
terran
was
already
on
his
way
to
the
deck
he
hurried
to
the
rail
and
whistled
the
thin
shrill
summons
he
had
practiced
for
weeks
before
he
had
ever
begun
this
fantastic
adventure
a
sleek
dark
body
broke
water
and
the
dolphin
grin
was
exposed
as
answered
his
call
though
ross
communication
powers
with
the
two
finned
scouts
was
very
far
from
karara
he
caught
the
message
in
part
and
swung
around
to
face
the
rovers
who
had
crowded
after
him
we
have
a
way
now
of
learning
more
about
your
enemies
a
boat
it
comes
without
sail
or
oars
one
of
the
crew
pointed
ross
waved
vigorously
but
no
hand
replied
from
the
skiff
though
it
came
steadily
onward
the
three
cruisers
its
apparent
goal
karara
ross
called
then
side
by
side
with
were
two
wet
heads
two
masked
faces
showing
as
the
swimmers
trod
water
karara
and
loketh
drop
ropes
ross
gave
that
order
as
if
he
rather
than
torgul
commanded
and
the
captain
himself
was
one
of
those
who
moved
to
obey
loketh
came
out
of
the
sea
first
and
as
he
scrambled
over
the
rail
he
had
his
sword
ready
looking
from
ross
to
torgul
the
terran
held
up
empty
hands
and
smiled
no
trouble
now
loketh
snapped
up
his
mask
so
the
sea
maid
said
the
finned
ones
reported
yet
before
these
thirsted
for
your
blood
on
their
blades
what
magic
have
you
worked
none
just
the
truth
has
been
discovered
ross
reached
for
hand
as
she
came
nimbly
up
the
rope
swung
her
across
the
rail
to
the
deck
where
she
stood
unmasked
brushing
back
her
hair
and
looking
around
with
a
lively
curiosity
karara
this
is
captain
torgul
ross
introduced
the
rover
commander
who
was
staring
at
the
girl
karara
is
she
who
swims
with
the
finned
ones
and
they
obey
her
ross
gestured
to
it
is
taua
who
brings
the
skiff
he
asked
the
polynesian
she
nodded
we
followed
from
the
gate
then
loketh
came
and
said
that
that
she
paused
and
then
added
but
you
do
not
seem
to
be
in
danger
what
has
happened
much
listen
this
is
important
there
is
trouble
at
an
island
ahead
the
baldies
were
there
they
murdered
the
kin
of
these
men
the
odds
are
they
reached
there
by
some
form
of
sub
send
one
of
the
dolphins
to
see
what
is
happening
and
if
they
are
still
there
karara
asked
no
more
questions
but
whistled
to
the
dolphin
with
a
flip
of
tail
took
off
since
they
could
make
no
concrete
plan
of
action
the
cruiser
captains
agreed
to
wait
for
report
and
to
cruise
well
out
of
sight
of
the
fairing
harbor
until
it
came
this
belief
in
magic
ross
remarked
to
karara
has
one
advantage
the
natives
seem
able
to
take
in
their
stride
the
fact
the
dolphins
will
scout
for
us
they
have
lived
their
lives
on
the
sea
for
it
they
must
have
a
vast
respect
perhaps
they
know
as
did
my
people
that
the
ocean
has
many
secrets
some
of
which
are
never
revealed
except
to
the
forms
of
life
which
claim
their
homes
there
but
even
if
you
discover
this
baldy
sub
what
will
the
rovers
be
able
to
do
about
it
i
do
know
yet
ross
could
not
tell
why
he
clung
to
the
idea
that
they
could
do
anything
to
strike
back
at
the
superior
alien
force
he
only
knew
that
he
was
not
yet
willing
to
relinquish
the
thought
that
in
some
way
they
could
and
ashe
yes
ashe
i
do
know
it
hurt
ross
to
admit
that
back
there
what
really
happened
at
the
gate
he
asked
karara
all
at
once
the
dolphins
seemed
to
go
crazy
i
think
for
a
moment
or
two
they
did
you
felt
nothing
no
it
was
like
a
fire
slashing
through
the
head
some
protective
device
of
the
foanna
i
think
a
mental
defense
to
which
he
was
not
sensitive
which
meant
that
he
might
be
able
to
breach
that
gate
if
none
of
the
others
could
but
he
had
to
be
there
first
suppose
just
suppose
torgul
could
be
persuaded
that
this
attack
on
the
gutted
kyn
add
was
useless
would
the
rover
commander
take
them
back
to
the
foanna
keep
or
with
the
dolphins
and
the
skiff
could
ross
himself
return
to
make
the
try
that
he
could
make
it
on
his
own
ross
doubted
excitement
and
will
power
had
buoyed
him
up
throughout
the
past
hawaikan
day
and
night
now
fatigue
closed
in
past
his
conditioning
and
the
stimulant
of
the
terran
rations
to
enclose
him
in
a
groggy
haze
he
had
been
warned
against
this
reaction
but
that
was
just
another
item
he
had
pushed
out
of
his
conscious
mind
the
last
thing
he
remembered
now
was
seeing
karara
move
through
a
fuzzy
cloud
voices
argued
somewhere
beyond
the
force
of
that
argument
carried
more
by
tone
than
any
words
ross
could
understand
he
was
pulled
sluggishly
out
of
a
slumber
too
deep
for
any
dream
to
trouble
and
lifted
heavy
eyelids
to
see
karara
once
again
there
was
a
prick
in
his
arm
or
was
that
part
of
the
unreality
about
him
four
five
six
she
was
counting
and
ross
found
himself
joining
in
seven
eight
nine
ten
on
reaching
ten
he
was
fully
awake
and
knew
that
she
had
applied
the
emergency
procedure
they
had
been
drilled
in
using
giving
him
a
pep
shot
when
ross
sat
up
on
the
narrow
bunk
there
was
a
light
in
the
cabin
and
no
sign
of
day
outside
the
porthole
torgul
vistur
the
two
other
cruiser
captains
all
there
and
jazia
ross
swung
his
feet
to
the
deck
a
headache
was
already
beginning
but
would
wear
off
soon
there
was
however
a
concentration
of
tension
in
the
cabin
and
something
must
have
driven
karara
to
use
the
drug
what
is
it
karara
fitted
the
medical
kit
into
the
compact
carrying
case
has
returned
there
a
sub
in
the
bay
it
emits
energy
waves
on
a
shoreward
beam
then
they
are
still
there
ross
accepted
the
dolphin
report
without
question
neither
of
the
scouts
would
make
a
mistake
in
those
matters
energy
waves
beamed
shoreward
power
for
some
type
of
unit
the
baldies
were
using
suppose
the
rovers
could
find
a
way
of
cutting
off
the
power
the
sea
maid
has
told
us
that
this
ship
sits
on
the
bottom
of
the
harbor
if
we
could
board
it
began
torgul
yes
vistur
brought
his
fist
down
against
the
end
of
the
bunk
on
which
the
terran
still
sat
jarring
the
dull
pain
in
ross
head
take
it
then
turn
it
against
its
crew
there
was
an
eagerness
in
all
rover
faces
for
that
was
a
game
the
hawaikan
seafarers
understood
take
an
enemy
ship
and
turn
its
armament
against
its
companions
in
a
fleet
but
that
plan
would
not
work
out
ross
had
a
healthy
respect
for
the
technical
knowledge
of
the
galactic
invaders
of
course
he
karara
even
loketh
might
be
able
to
reach
the
sub
whether
they
could
then
board
her
was
an
entirely
different
matter
now
the
polynesian
girl
shook
her
head
the
broadcast
there
rates
it
as
lethal
there
are
dead
fish
floating
in
the
bay
he
had
warning
at
the
reef
entrance
without
a
shield
there
will
be
no
way
of
getting
in
might
as
well
wish
for
a
depth
bomb
ross
began
and
then
stopped
you
have
thought
of
something
a
shield
ross
repeated
her
words
it
was
so
wild
this
thought
of
his
and
one
which
might
have
no
chance
of
working
he
knew
almost
nothing
about
the
resources
of
the
invaders
could
that
broadcast
which
protected
the
sub
and
perhaps
activated
the
weapons
of
the
invaders
ashore
be
destroyed
a
wall
of
fish
sea
life
herded
in
there
as
a
shield
wild
yes
even
so
wild
it
might
work
ross
outlined
the
idea
speaking
more
to
karara
than
to
the
rovers
i
do
not
know
she
said
doubtfully
that
would
need
many
fish
too
many
to
herd
and
drive
not
fish
torgul
cut
in
salkars
salkars
you
have
seen
the
bow
carving
on
this
ship
that
is
a
salkar
such
are
larger
than
a
hundred
fish
salkars
driven
in
they
might
even
wreck
this
undersea
ship
with
their
weight
and
anger
and
you
can
find
these
salkars
ross
began
to
take
fire
that
dragon
which
had
hunted
him
the
bulk
of
the
thing
was
well
above
any
other
sea
life
he
had
seen
here
and
to
its
ferocity
he
could
give
testimony
at
the
spawning
reefs
we
do
not
hunt
at
this
season
which
is
the
time
of
the
taking
of
mates
now
too
they
are
easily
angered
so
they
will
even
attack
a
cruiser
to
slay
them
at
present
is
a
loss
for
their
skins
are
not
good
but
they
would
be
ripe
for
battle
were
they
to
be
disturbed
and
how
would
you
get
them
from
the
spawning
reefs
to
kyn
add
that
is
not
too
difficult
the
reef
lies
here
torgul
drew
lines
with
the
point
of
his
sword
on
the
table
top
and
here
is
kyn
add
salkars
have
a
great
hunger
at
this
time
show
them
bait
and
they
will
follow
especially
will
they
follow
swimming
bait
there
were
a
great
many
holes
in
the
plan
which
had
only
a
halfway
chance
of
working
but
the
rovers
seized
upon
it
with
enthusiasm
and
so
it
was
set
up
perhaps
some
two
hours
later
ross
swam
toward
the
land
mass
of
kyn
add
gleams
of
light
pricked
on
the
shore
well
to
his
left
those
must
mark
the
rover
settlement
and
again
the
terran
wondered
why
the
invaders
had
remained
there
unless
they
knew
that
there
had
been
three
cruisers
out
on
a
raid
and
for
some
reason
they
were
determined
to
make
a
complete
karara
moved
a
little
to
his
right
taua
between
them
the
super
senses
their
guide
and
warning
the
swiftest
of
the
cruisers
had
departed
loketh
on
board
to
communicate
with
in
the
water
since
the
male
dolphin
was
the
best
equipped
to
provide
a
fox
for
salkar
hounds
he
was
the
bait
for
this
weird
fishing
expedition
no
farther
ross
sonic
pricked
a
warning
against
his
body
through
that
he
took
a
jolt
which
sent
him
back
away
from
the
bay
entrance
on
the
reef
karara
tapped
code
drew
him
on
a
new
course
moments
later
they
were
both
out
of
the
water
though
the
wash
of
waves
over
their
flippered
feet
was
constant
the
rocks
among
which
they
crouched
were
a
rough
harborage
from
which
they
could
see
the
shore
as
a
dark
blot
but
they
were
well
away
from
the
break
in
the
reef
through
which
if
their
outlandish
plan
succeeded
the
salkars
would
come
a
chance
ross
commented
as
he
put
up
his
mask
was
not
the
whole
time
agent
project
founded
on
just
such
chances
karara
asked
the
right
question
this
was
ross
kind
of
venture
yes
chances
had
been
pulled
off
by
the
time
agents
why
it
had
been
close
to
those
odds
against
their
ever
finding
what
they
had
first
sought
along
the
back
trails
of
time
the
wrecked
spaceships
just
suppose
this
could
be
a
rehearsal
for
another
attack
if
the
salkars
could
be
made
to
crack
the
guard
of
the
baldies
could
they
also
be
used
against
the
foanna
gate
maybe
but
take
one
fight
at
a
time
they
come
karara
fingers
gripped
ross
shoulder
her
hand
was
hard
bar
rigid
he
could
see
nothing
hear
nothing
that
warning
must
have
come
from
the
dolphins
but
so
far
their
plan
was
working
the
monsters
of
the
hawaikan
sea
were
on
their
way
baldies
ohhhh
karara
clutched
at
ross
her
breath
coming
in
little
gasps
giving
vent
to
her
fear
and
horror
they
had
not
known
what
might
come
from
this
plan
certainly
neither
had
foreseen
the
present
chaos
in
the
lagoon
perhaps
the
broadcast
energy
of
the
enemy
whipped
the
already
salkars
into
this
insane
fury
but
now
the
moonlit
water
was
beaten
into
foam
as
the
creatures
fought
there
attacking
each
other
with
a
ferocity
neither
terran
had
witnessed
before
lights
gleamed
along
the
shore
where
the
alien
invaders
must
have
been
drawn
by
the
clamor
of
the
fighting
marine
reptiles
somewhere
in
the
heights
above
the
beach
of
the
lagoon
a
picked
band
of
rovers
should
now
be
making
their
way
from
the
opposite
side
of
kyn
add
under
strict
orders
not
to
go
into
attack
unless
signaled
whether
the
independent
sea
warriors
would
hold
to
that
command
was
a
question
which
had
worried
ross
from
the
first
and
taua
in
the
waters
to
the
seaward
of
the
reef
the
two
terrans
on
that
barrier
itself
and
between
them
and
the
shore
the
wild
melee
of
maddened
salkars
ross
started
the
sonic
warning
which
had
been
pulsing
steadily
against
his
skin
cut
off
sharply
the
broadcast
in
the
bay
had
been
silenced
this
was
the
time
to
move
but
no
swimmer
could
last
in
the
lagoon
itself
along
the
reef
karara
said
that
would
be
the
long
way
round
ross
knew
but
the
only
one
possible
he
studied
the
cluster
of
lights
ashore
two
or
three
figures
moved
there
seemingly
the
attention
of
the
aliens
was
well
centered
upon
the
battle
still
in
progress
in
the
lagoon
stay
here
he
ordered
the
girl
adjusting
his
mask
ross
dropped
into
the
water
cutting
away
from
the
reef
and
then
turning
to
swim
parallel
with
it
matched
him
as
he
went
guiding
ross
to
a
second
break
in
the
reef
toward
the
shore
some
distance
from
where
the
conflict
of
the
salkars
still
made
a
hideous
din
in
the
night
the
terran
waded
in
the
shallows
stripping
off
his
flippers
and
snapping
them
to
his
belt
letting
his
mask
swing
free
on
his
chest
he
angled
toward
the
beach
where
the
aliens
had
been
at
least
he
was
better
armed
for
this
than
he
had
been
when
he
had
fronted
the
rovers
with
only
a
diver
knife
from
the
time
agent
supplies
he
had
taken
the
single
hand
weapon
he
had
long
ago
found
in
the
armory
of
the
derelict
spaceship
this
could
only
be
used
sparingly
since
they
did
not
know
how
it
could
be
recharged
and
the
secret
of
its
beam
still
remained
secret
as
far
as
terran
technicians
were
concerned
ross
worked
his
way
to
a
curtain
of
underbrush
from
which
he
had
a
free
view
of
the
beach
and
the
aliens
three
of
them
he
counted
and
they
were
baldies
all
right
taller
and
thinner
than
his
own
species
their
bald
heads
the
upper
dome
of
their
skulls
overshadowing
the
features
on
their
pointed
chinned
faces
they
all
wore
the
skintight
suits
of
the
space
voyagers
suits
which
ross
knew
of
old
were
insulated
and
protective
for
their
wearers
as
well
as
a
medium
for
keeping
in
touch
with
one
another
just
as
he
wearing
one
had
once
been
trailed
over
miles
of
wilderness
to
him
all
three
of
the
invaders
looked
enough
alike
to
have
been
stamped
out
from
one
pattern
and
their
movements
suggested
that
they
worked
or
went
into
action
with
drilled
precision
they
all
faced
seaward
holding
tubes
aimed
at
the
lagoon
there
was
no
sound
of
any
explosion
but
green
spears
of
light
struck
at
the
scaled
bodies
plunging
in
the
water
and
where
those
beams
struck
flesh
seared
methodically
the
trio
raked
the
basin
but
ross
noted
those
beams
which
had
been
steady
at
his
first
sighting
were
now
interrupted
by
flickers
one
of
the
baldies
upended
his
tube
rapped
its
butt
against
a
rock
as
if
trying
to
correct
a
jamming
when
the
alien
went
into
action
once
again
his
weapon
flashed
and
failed
within
a
matter
of
moments
the
other
two
were
also
finished
the
lighted
rods
pushed
into
the
sand
giving
a
glow
to
the
scene
darkened
as
a
fire
might
sink
to
embers
power
fading
an
ungainly
shape
floundered
out
of
the
churned
water
lumbered
over
the
shale
of
the
beach
its
supple
neck
outstretched
its
horned
nose
down
for
a
charge
ross
had
not
realized
that
the
salkars
could
operate
out
of
what
he
thought
was
their
natural
element
but
this
dragon
was
plainly
bent
on
reaching
its
tormentors
for
a
moment
or
two
the
baldies
continued
to
front
the
creature
almost
ross
thought
as
if
they
could
not
believe
that
their
weapons
had
failed
them
then
they
broke
and
ran
back
to
the
fairing
which
they
had
taken
with
such
contemptuous
ease
the
salkar
plowed
along
in
their
wake
but
its
movements
grew
more
labored
the
farther
it
advanced
until
at
last
it
lay
with
only
its
head
upraised
darting
it
back
and
forth
its
fanged
jaws
well
agape
voicing
a
coughing
howl
its
plaint
was
answered
from
the
water
as
a
second
of
its
kind
wallowed
ashore
a
terrible
wound
had
torn
skin
and
flesh
just
behind
its
neck
yet
still
it
came
on
hissing
and
bubbling
a
battle
challenge
it
did
not
attack
its
fellow
instead
it
dragged
its
bulk
past
the
first
comer
on
its
way
after
the
baldies
the
salkars
continued
to
come
ashore
two
more
a
third
a
fourth
mangled
and
torn
pulling
themselves
as
far
as
they
could
up
the
beach
to
lie
facing
inland
their
necks
weaving
their
horned
heads
bobbing
their
cries
a
frightful
din
what
had
drawn
them
out
of
their
preoccupation
of
battle
among
themselves
into
this
attempt
to
reach
the
aliens
ross
could
not
determine
unless
the
intelligence
of
the
beasts
was
such
that
they
had
been
able
to
connect
the
searing
beams
which
the
baldies
had
turned
on
them
so
tellingly
with
the
men
on
the
beach
and
had
responded
by
striving
to
reach
a
common
enemy
but
no
desire
could
give
them
the
necessary
energy
to
pull
far
ashore
almost
helplessly
beached
they
continued
to
dig
into
the
yielding
sand
with
their
flippers
in
a
vain
effort
to
pursue
the
aliens
ross
skirted
the
clamoring
barrier
of
salkars
and
headed
for
the
fairing
a
neck
snapped
about
a
head
was
lowered
in
his
direction
he
smelled
the
rank
stench
of
reptile
combined
with
burned
flesh
the
nearest
of
the
brutes
must
have
scented
the
terran
in
turn
as
it
was
now
trying
vainly
to
edge
around
to
cut
across
ross
path
but
it
was
completely
outclassed
on
land
and
the
man
dodged
it
easily
three
baldies
had
fled
this
way
yet
jazia
had
reported
five
had
come
out
of
the
sea
to
take
kyn
add
two
were
missing
where
had
they
remained
in
the
fairing
were
they
now
in
the
sub
and
that
sub
what
had
happened
to
it
the
broadcast
had
been
cut
off
he
had
seen
the
failure
of
the
weapons
and
the
shore
lights
might
the
sub
have
suffered
from
salkar
attack
though
ross
could
hardly
believe
that
the
beasts
could
wreck
it
the
terran
was
traveling
blindly
keeping
well
under
cover
of
such
brush
as
he
could
knowing
only
that
he
must
head
inland
under
his
feet
the
ground
was
rising
and
he
recalled
the
nature
of
this
territory
as
torgul
and
jazia
had
pictured
it
for
him
this
had
to
be
part
of
the
ridge
wall
of
the
valley
in
which
lay
the
buildings
of
the
fairing
in
these
heights
was
the
shrine
of
phutka
where
jazia
had
hidden
out
to
the
west
now
lay
the
rover
village
so
he
had
to
work
his
way
left
downhill
in
order
to
reach
the
hole
where
the
baldies
had
gone
to
ground
ross
made
that
progress
with
the
stealth
of
a
trained
scout
hawaika
moon
triple
in
size
to
terra
companion
was
up
and
the
landscape
was
sharply
clear
with
shadows
well
defined
the
glow
weird
to
terran
eyes
added
to
the
effect
of
being
abroad
in
a
nightmare
and
the
bellowing
of
the
grounded
salkars
continued
a
devils
chorus
when
the
rovers
had
put
up
the
buildings
of
their
fairing
they
had
cleared
a
series
of
small
fields
radiating
outward
from
those
structures
all
of
these
were
now
covered
with
crops
almost
ready
to
harvest
the
grain
if
that
terran
term
could
be
applied
to
this
hawaikan
product
was
housed
in
long
pods
which
dipped
from
bushes
and
the
pods
were
well
equipped
with
horny
projections
which
tore
a
single
try
at
making
his
way
into
one
of
those
fields
convinced
ross
of
the
folly
of
such
an
advance
he
sat
back
to
nurse
his
scratched
hands
and
survey
the
landscape
to
go
down
a
very
tempting
lane
would
be
making
himself
a
clear
target
for
anyone
in
those
buildings
ahead
he
had
seen
the
flamers
of
the
baldies
fail
on
the
beach
but
that
did
not
mean
the
aliens
were
now
weaponless
his
best
chance
ross
decided
was
to
circle
north
come
back
down
along
the
bed
of
a
stream
and
he
was
at
the
edge
of
that
watercourse
when
a
faint
sound
brought
him
to
a
frozen
halt
weapon
ready
rosss
loketh
and
torgul
and
vistur
this
was
the
party
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
island
gone
expertly
to
earth
in
the
moonlight
ross
could
detect
no
sign
of
their
presence
yet
their
voices
sounded
almost
beside
him
they
are
in
there
in
the
great
hall
that
was
torgul
but
no
longer
are
there
any
lights
now
an
urgent
exclamation
drew
their
attention
light
below
but
not
the
glow
of
the
rods
ross
had
seen
on
the
beach
this
was
the
warm
of
honest
fire
bursting
up
the
flames
growing
higher
as
if
being
fed
with
frantic
haste
three
figures
were
moving
down
there
ross
began
to
believe
that
there
were
only
this
trio
ashore
he
could
sight
no
weapons
in
their
hands
which
did
not
necessarily
mean
they
were
unarmed
but
the
stream
ran
close
behind
the
rear
wall
of
one
of
the
buildings
and
ross
thought
its
bed
could
provide
cover
for
a
man
who
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
pointed
out
as
much
to
torgul
and
if
their
magic
works
and
you
are
drawn
out
to
be
killed
the
rover
captain
came
directly
to
the
point
that
is
a
chance
to
be
taken
but
remember
the
magic
of
the
foanna
at
the
sea
gate
did
not
work
against
me
perhaps
this
wo
either
once
earlier
i
won
against
it
have
you
then
another
hand
to
give
to
the
fire
as
your
defense
that
was
vistur
but
no
man
has
the
right
to
order
another
battle
challenge
just
so
returned
ross
sharply
and
this
is
a
thing
i
have
long
been
trained
to
do
he
slid
down
into
the
stream
bed
approaching
from
this
angle
the
structures
of
the
fairing
were
between
him
and
the
fire
so
screened
he
reached
a
log
wall
got
to
his
feet
and
edged
along
it
then
he
witnessed
a
wild
scene
the
fire
raged
in
great
tongues
and
already
the
roof
of
one
of
the
rover
buildings
smoldered
why
the
aliens
had
built
up
such
a
conflagration
ross
could
not
guess
a
signal
designed
to
reach
some
distance
he
did
not
doubt
there
was
some
urgent
purpose
for
the
three
were
dragging
in
fuel
with
almost
frenzied
haste
bringing
out
of
the
rover
buildings
bales
of
cloth
to
be
ripped
apart
and
whirled
into
the
devouring
flames
furniture
everything
movable
which
would
burn
there
was
one
satisfaction
the
baldies
were
so
intent
upon
this
destruction
that
they
kept
no
watch
save
that
now
and
then
one
of
them
would
run
to
the
head
of
the
path
leading
to
the
lagoon
and
listen
as
if
he
expected
a
salkar
to
come
pounding
up
the
slope
they
they
rattled
ross
could
hardly
believe
it
the
baldies
who
had
always
occupied
his
mind
and
memory
as
practically
invincible
supermen
were
acting
like
badly
frightened
primitives
and
when
the
enemy
was
so
off
balance
you
pushed
you
pushed
hard
ross
thumbed
the
button
on
the
grip
of
the
strange
weapon
he
sighted
with
deliberation
and
fired
the
blue
figure
at
the
top
of
the
path
wilted
and
for
a
long
moment
neither
of
his
companions
noted
his
collapse
then
one
of
them
whirled
and
started
for
the
limp
body
his
colleague
running
after
him
ross
allowed
them
to
reach
his
first
victim
before
he
fired
the
second
and
third
time
all
three
lay
quiet
but
still
ross
did
not
venture
forth
until
he
had
counted
off
a
dozen
terran
seconds
then
he
slipped
forward
keeping
to
cover
until
he
came
up
to
the
bodies
the
shoulder
had
a
flaccid
feel
under
his
hand
as
if
the
muscles
could
not
control
the
flesh
about
them
ross
rolled
the
alien
over
looked
down
in
the
bright
light
of
the
fire
into
the
eyes
amazement
the
terran
thought
he
could
read
that
in
the
dead
stare
which
answered
his
intent
gaze
and
then
anger
a
cold
and
deadly
anger
which
chilled
into
ice
kill
ross
slewed
around
still
down
on
one
knee
to
face
the
charge
of
a
rover
in
the
firelight
the
hawaikan
eyes
were
blazing
with
fanatical
hatred
he
had
his
hooked
sword
ready
to
deliver
a
finishing
stroke
the
terran
blocked
with
a
shoulder
to
meet
the
rover
knees
threw
him
back
then
ross
landed
on
top
of
the
fighting
crewman
trying
to
pin
the
fellow
to
earth
and
avoid
that
recklessly
slashing
blade
loketh
vistur
ross
shouted
as
he
struggled
more
of
the
rovers
appeared
from
between
the
buildings
bearing
down
on
the
limp
aliens
and
the
two
fighting
men
ross
recognized
the
limping
gait
of
loketh
using
a
branch
to
aid
him
into
a
running
scuttle
across
the
open
loketh
here
the
hawaikan
covered
the
last
few
feet
in
a
dive
which
carried
him
into
ross
and
the
rover
hold
him
the
terran
ordered
and
had
just
time
enough
to
throw
himself
between
the
baldies
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
there
was
a
snarling
from
the
rovers
and
ross
knowing
their
temper
was
afraid
he
could
not
save
the
captives
which
they
considered
fairly
their
legitimate
prey
he
must
depend
upon
the
hope
that
there
were
one
or
two
cooler
heads
among
them
with
enough
authority
to
restrain
the
avengers
otherwise
he
would
have
to
beam
them
into
helplessness
torgul
he
shouted
there
was
a
break
in
the
line
of
runners
speeding
for
him
the
big
man
lunging
straight
across
could
only
be
vistur
the
other
yelling
orders
was
torgul
it
would
depend
upon
how
much
control
the
captain
had
over
his
men
ross
scrambled
to
his
feet
he
had
clicked
on
the
beamer
to
its
lowest
frequency
it
would
not
kill
but
would
render
its
victim
temporarily
paralyzed
and
how
long
that
state
would
continue
ross
had
no
way
of
knowing
tried
on
terran
laboratory
animals
the
time
had
varied
from
days
to
weeks
vistur
used
the
flat
side
of
his
war
ax
clapping
it
against
the
foremost
runners
setting
his
own
bulk
to
impose
a
barrier
and
now
torgul
orders
appeared
to
be
getting
through
more
and
more
of
the
men
slacked
leaving
a
trio
of
hotheads
two
of
whom
vistur
sent
reeling
with
his
fists
the
captain
came
up
to
ross
they
are
alive
then
he
leaned
over
to
inspect
the
baldy
the
terran
had
rolled
on
his
back
assessing
the
alien
frozen
stare
with
thoughtful
measurement
yes
but
they
can
not
move
well
enough
torgul
nodded
they
shall
meet
the
justice
of
phutka
after
the
law
i
think
they
will
wish
that
they
had
been
left
to
the
boarding
axes
of
angry
men
they
are
worth
more
alive
than
dead
captain
do
you
not
wish
to
know
why
they
have
carried
war
to
your
people
how
many
of
them
there
may
yet
be
to
attack
and
other
things
also
ross
nodded
at
the
fire
now
catching
the
second
building
why
have
they
built
up
that
blaze
is
it
a
signal
to
others
of
their
kind
very
well
said
yes
it
would
be
well
for
us
to
learn
such
things
nor
will
phutka
be
jealous
of
the
time
we
take
to
ask
questions
and
get
answers
many
answers
he
prodded
the
baldy
with
the
toe
of
his
sea
boot
how
long
will
they
remain
so
your
magic
has
a
bite
in
it
ross
smiled
not
my
magic
captain
this
weapon
was
taken
from
one
of
their
own
ships
as
to
how
long
they
will
remain
so
that
i
do
not
know
very
well
we
can
take
precautions
under
torgul
orders
the
aliens
were
draped
with
capture
nets
like
those
ross
and
loketh
had
worn
the
plant
adhered
instantly
wet
strands
knitting
in
perfect
restrainers
as
long
as
it
was
uncut
having
seen
to
that
torgul
ordered
the
excavation
of
kyn
add
as
you
say
he
remarked
to
ross
that
fire
may
well
be
a
signal
to
bring
down
more
of
their
kind
i
think
we
have
had
the
favor
of
phutka
in
this
matter
but
the
prudent
man
stretches
no
favor
of
that
kind
too
far
also
he
looked
about
him
we
have
given
to
phutka
and
the
shades
our
dead
there
is
nothing
for
us
here
now
but
hate
and
sorrow
in
one
day
we
have
been
broken
from
a
clan
of
pride
and
ships
to
a
handful
of
standardless
men
you
will
join
some
other
clan
karara
had
come
with
jazia
to
stand
on
the
stone
ledge
chipped
to
form
a
base
for
a
column
bearing
a
strange
head
looking
seaward
the
rover
woman
was
superintending
the
freeing
of
the
head
from
the
column
at
the
terran
girl
question
the
captain
gazed
down
into
the
dreadful
chaos
of
the
valley
they
could
yet
hear
the
roars
of
the
dying
salkars
the
reptiles
that
had
made
their
way
to
land
had
not
withdrawn
but
still
lay
some
dead
now
some
with
weaving
heads
reaching
inland
and
the
whole
of
the
fairing
was
ablaze
with
fire
we
are
now
men
sea
maid
for
such
there
is
no
clan
there
is
only
the
hunting
and
the
kill
with
the
magic
of
phutka
perhaps
we
shall
have
a
short
hunt
and
a
good
kill
there
now
so
jazia
stepped
back
the
head
which
had
faced
the
sea
was
lowered
carefully
to
a
wide
strip
of
stuff
she
had
brought
from
torgul
ship
with
her
one
usable
hand
the
rover
woman
drew
the
fabric
about
the
carving
muffling
it
except
for
the
eyes
those
were
large
ovals
deeply
carved
and
in
them
ross
saw
a
glitter
jewels
set
there
yet
he
had
a
queer
shivery
feeling
that
something
more
than
gems
occupied
those
sockets
that
he
had
actually
been
regarded
for
an
instant
of
time
assessed
and
dismissed
we
go
now
jazia
waved
and
torgul
sent
men
forward
they
lifted
the
wrapped
carving
to
a
board
carried
between
them
and
started
downslope
karara
cried
out
and
ross
looked
around
the
pillar
which
had
supported
the
head
was
crumbling
away
breaking
into
a
rubble
which
cascaded
across
the
stone
ledge
ross
blinked
this
must
be
an
illusion
but
he
was
too
tired
to
be
more
than
dully
amazed
as
he
became
one
of
the
procession
returning
to
the
ships
the
sea
gate
of
the
foanna
ross
raised
a
shell
cup
to
his
lips
but
hardly
sipped
the
fiery
brew
it
contained
this
was
a
gesture
of
ceremony
but
he
wanted
a
steady
head
and
a
quick
tongue
for
any
coming
argument
torgul
afrukta
ongal
the
three
commanders
of
the
rover
cruisers
jazia
who
represented
the
mysterious
power
of
phutka
vistur
and
some
other
subordinate
officers
karara
himself
with
loketh
hovering
behind
a
council
of
war
but
summoned
against
whom
the
terran
had
come
too
far
afield
from
his
own
purpose
to
reach
ashe
in
the
foanna
keep
and
to
further
his
own
plans
was
a
task
he
doubted
his
ability
to
perform
his
attack
on
the
baldies
had
made
him
too
important
to
the
rovers
for
them
to
allow
him
willingly
to
leave
them
on
a
quest
of
his
own
these
star
men
ross
set
down
the
cup
tried
to
choose
the
most
telling
words
in
his
limited
hawaikan
vocabulary
possess
weapons
and
powers
you
can
not
dream
of
that
you
have
no
defense
against
back
at
kyn
add
we
were
lucky
the
salkars
attacked
their
sub
and
halted
the
broadcast
powering
their
flamers
otherwise
we
could
not
have
taken
them
even
though
we
were
many
against
their
few
now
you
talk
of
hunting
them
in
their
own
territory
on
land
and
in
the
mountains
where
they
have
their
base
that
would
be
folly
akin
to
swimming
barehanded
to
front
a
salkar
so
then
we
must
sit
and
wait
for
them
to
eat
us
up
flared
ongal
i
say
it
is
better
to
die
fighting
with
one
blade
wet
do
you
not
also
wish
to
take
at
least
one
of
the
enemy
with
you
when
you
fight
to
that
finish
ross
countered
these
could
kill
you
before
you
came
in
blade
range
you
had
no
trouble
with
that
weapon
of
yours
afrukta
spoke
up
i
have
told
you
this
weapon
was
stolen
from
them
i
have
only
one
and
i
do
not
know
how
long
it
will
continue
to
serve
me
or
whether
they
have
a
defense
against
it
those
we
took
were
naked
to
any
force
for
their
broadcast
had
failed
them
but
to
smash
blindly
against
their
main
base
would
be
the
act
of
madmen
the
salkars
opened
a
way
for
us
that
was
torgul
but
we
can
not
move
a
pack
of
those
inland
to
the
mountains
vistur
pointed
out
reasonably
ross
studied
the
captain
that
torgul
was
groping
for
a
plan
and
that
it
had
to
be
a
shrewd
one
the
terran
guessed
his
respect
for
the
rover
commander
had
been
growing
steadily
since
their
first
meeting
the
had
always
been
captained
by
the
most
daring
men
of
the
rover
clans
but
ross
was
also
certain
that
a
successful
cruiser
commander
must
possess
a
leaven
of
intelligence
and
be
a
strategist
of
parts
the
hawaikan
force
needed
a
key
which
would
open
the
baldy
base
as
the
salkars
had
opened
the
lagoon
and
all
they
had
to
aid
them
was
a
handful
of
facts
gained
from
their
prisoners
oddly
enough
the
picklock
to
the
captives
minds
had
been
produced
by
the
dolphins
just
as
and
taua
had
formed
a
bridge
of
communication
between
the
terran
and
loketh
so
did
they
read
and
translate
the
thoughts
of
the
galactic
invaders
for
the
baldies
among
their
own
kind
were
telepathic
vocalizing
only
to
give
orders
to
inferiors
their
capture
by
these
primitive
inferiors
had
delivered
the
first
shock
and
the
of
the
dolphins
had
sent
the
supermen
close
to
the
edge
of
sanity
to
accept
an
animal
form
as
an
equal
had
been
shattering
but
the
star
men
thoughts
and
memories
had
been
winnowed
at
last
and
the
result
spread
before
this
impromptu
council
rovers
and
terrans
were
briefed
on
the
invaders
master
plan
for
taking
over
a
world
why
they
desired
to
do
so
even
the
dolphins
had
not
been
able
to
discover
perhaps
they
themselves
had
not
been
told
by
their
superiors
it
was
a
plan
almost
contemptuous
in
its
simplicity
as
if
the
galactic
force
had
no
reason
to
fear
effective
opposition
except
in
one
direction
one
single
direction
ross
fingers
tightened
on
the
shell
cup
had
torgul
reached
that
conclusion
yet
the
belief
that
the
foanna
could
be
their
key
if
so
they
might
be
able
to
achieve
their
separate
purposes
in
one
action
it
would
seem
that
they
are
wary
of
the
foanna
he
suggested
alert
to
any
telltale
response
from
torgul
but
it
was
jazia
who
answered
the
terran
half
question
the
foanna
have
a
powerful
magic
they
can
order
wind
and
wave
man
and
creature
if
so
be
their
will
well
might
these
killers
fear
the
foanna
yet
now
they
move
against
them
ross
pointed
out
still
eyeing
torgul
the
captain
reply
was
a
small
quiet
smile
not
directly
as
you
have
heard
it
is
all
a
part
of
their
plan
to
set
one
of
us
against
the
other
letting
us
fight
many
small
wars
and
so
use
up
our
men
while
they
take
no
risks
they
wait
the
day
when
we
shall
be
exhausted
and
then
they
will
reveal
themselves
to
claim
all
they
wish
so
today
they
stir
up
trouble
between
the
wreckers
and
the
foanna
knowing
that
the
foanna
are
few
also
they
strive
in
turn
to
anger
us
by
raids
allowing
us
to
believe
that
either
the
wreckers
or
foanna
have
attacked
thus
he
held
up
his
left
thumb
made
a
pincers
of
right
thumb
and
forefinger
to
close
upon
it
they
hope
to
catch
the
foanna
between
wreckers
and
rovers
because
the
foanna
are
those
they
reckon
the
most
dangerous
they
move
against
them
now
using
us
and
weakening
our
forces
into
the
bargain
a
plan
which
is
clever
but
the
plan
of
men
who
do
not
like
to
fight
with
their
own
blades
they
are
worse
than
the
coast
scum
these
cowards
ongal
spat
torgul
smiled
again
that
is
what
they
believe
we
will
say
kinsman
and
so
underrate
them
by
our
customs
yes
they
are
cowards
but
what
care
they
for
our
judgments
did
we
think
of
the
salkars
when
we
used
them
to
force
the
lagoon
no
they
were
only
beasts
to
be
our
tools
so
now
it
is
the
same
with
us
except
that
we
know
what
they
intend
and
we
shall
not
be
such
obedient
tools
if
the
foanna
are
our
answer
then
he
paused
gazing
into
his
cup
as
if
he
could
read
some
shadowy
future
there
if
the
foanna
are
the
answer
then
what
ross
pushed
instead
of
fighting
the
foanna
we
must
warm
cherish
try
to
ally
ourselves
with
them
and
do
all
that
while
we
still
have
time
just
how
do
we
do
these
things
demanded
ongal
the
foanna
you
would
warn
cherish
claim
as
allies
are
already
our
enemies
were
we
not
on
the
way
to
force
their
sea
gate
only
days
ago
there
is
no
chance
of
seeking
peace
now
and
have
the
finned
ones
not
learned
from
the
that
already
there
is
an
army
of
wreckers
camped
about
the
citadel
to
which
these
sons
of
the
shadow
plan
to
lend
certain
weapons
do
we
throw
away
three
cruisers
all
we
have
left
in
a
hopeless
fight
such
is
the
council
of
one
struck
by
loss
of
wits
there
is
a
way
my
way
ross
seized
the
opening
in
the
foanna
citadel
is
my
to
whose
service
i
am
vowed
we
were
on
our
way
to
attempt
his
freeing
when
your
ship
picked
us
out
of
the
waves
he
is
learned
beyond
me
in
the
dealing
with
strange
peoples
and
if
the
foanna
are
as
clever
as
you
say
they
will
already
have
discovered
that
he
is
not
just
a
slave
they
claimed
from
lord
zahur
there
it
was
in
the
open
his
own
somewhat
tattered
hope
that
ashe
had
been
able
to
impress
his
captors
with
his
knowledge
and
potential
trained
to
act
as
contact
man
with
other
races
there
was
a
chance
that
gordon
had
saved
himself
from
whatever
fate
had
been
planned
for
the
prisoners
the
foanna
had
claimed
if
that
happened
ashe
could
be
their
opening
wedge
in
the
foanna
stronghold
this
also
i
know
that
which
guards
the
gate
which
turns
your
minds
whirling
and
sent
you
back
from
your
raid
does
not
affect
me
i
may
be
able
to
win
inside
and
find
my
clansman
and
in
that
doing
treat
with
the
foanna
the
baldy
prisoners
had
not
underestimated
the
attack
on
the
foanna
citadel
as
the
rover
cruisers
beat
in
under
the
cover
of
night
the
fires
and
torches
of
both
besieged
and
besiegers
made
a
wild
glow
across
the
sky
only
on
the
sea
side
of
the
fortress
there
was
no
sign
of
involvement
whatever
guarded
the
gate
must
still
be
in
force
ross
stood
with
his
feet
well
apart
to
balance
his
body
against
the
swing
of
the
deck
his
suggestion
had
been
argued
over
protested
but
at
last
carried
with
the
support
of
torgul
and
jazia
and
now
he
was
to
make
his
try
the
sum
of
the
rovers
and
loketh
knowledge
of
the
sea
gate
had
been
added
for
his
benefit
but
he
knew
that
this
venture
must
depend
upon
himself
alone
karara
the
dolphins
the
hawaikans
were
all
too
sensitive
to
the
barrier
torgul
moved
in
the
faint
light
we
are
close
our
power
is
ebbing
if
we
advance
we
shall
be
drifting
soon
it
is
time
then
ross
crossed
to
the
rope
ladder
but
another
was
there
before
him
karara
perched
on
the
rail
he
regarded
her
angrily
you
ca
go
i
know
but
we
are
still
safe
here
just
because
you
are
free
of
one
defense
of
the
gate
ross
do
not
believe
that
makes
it
easy
he
was
stung
by
her
assumption
that
he
could
be
so
i
know
my
business
ross
pushed
past
her
swinging
down
the
rope
ladder
pausing
only
above
water
level
to
snap
on
flippers
make
sure
of
the
set
of
his
weighted
belt
and
slide
his
over
his
face
there
was
a
splash
beside
him
as
the
net
containing
spare
belt
flippers
and
mask
hit
the
water
and
he
caught
at
it
these
could
provide
ashe
escape
from
the
fortress
the
lights
on
the
shore
made
a
wide
arc
of
radiance
across
the
sea
as
ross
headed
toward
the
coast
he
began
to
hear
shouting
and
other
sounds
which
made
him
believe
that
the
besiegers
were
in
the
midst
of
an
assault
yet
those
distant
fires
and
rocketlike
blasts
into
the
sky
had
a
wavery
blur
and
ross
making
his
way
with
the
effortless
water
cleaving
of
the
diver
surfaced
now
and
then
to
spot
film
curling
up
from
the
surface
of
the
sea
between
the
two
standing
rock
pillars
which
marked
the
sea
gate
he
was
startled
by
a
thunderous
crack
rending
the
air
above
the
small
bay
ross
pulled
to
one
of
the
pillars
steadied
himself
with
one
hand
against
it
those
twists
of
film
rising
from
the
surging
surface
were
thickening
more
tendrils
grew
out
from
parent
stems
to
creep
along
above
the
waves
raising
up
sprouts
and
branches
in
turn
a
wall
of
mist
was
building
between
gate
and
shore
again
a
thunderclap
overhead
involuntarily
the
terran
ducked
then
he
turned
his
face
up
to
the
sky
striving
to
see
any
evidence
of
storm
what
hung
there
sped
the
growth
of
the
fog
on
the
water
yet
where
the
fog
was
it
was
a
darkness
spouting
from
the
highest
point
of
the
citadel
ross
could
not
explain
how
he
was
able
to
see
one
shade
of
darkness
against
equal
dusk
but
he
did
or
did
he
only
sense
it
he
shook
his
head
willing
himself
to
look
away
from
the
finger
only
it
was
a
finger
no
longer
now
it
was
a
fist
aimed
at
the
stars
it
was
fast
blotting
out
a
fist
rising
to
the
heavens
before
it
curled
back
descended
to
press
the
fortress
and
its
surroundings
into
rock
and
earth
fog
curled
about
ross
spilled
outward
through
the
sea
gates
he
loosed
his
grip
on
the
pillar
and
dived
swimming
on
through
the
gap
with
the
fortress
of
the
foanna
before
him
there
was
a
jetty
somewhere
ahead
that
much
he
knew
from
description
those
who
served
the
foanna
sometimes
took
sea
roads
and
they
had
slim
fast
cutters
for
such
coastwise
travel
ross
surfaced
cautiously
to
discover
there
was
no
visibility
to
wave
level
here
the
mist
was
thick
a
smothering
cover
so
bewildering
he
was
confused
as
to
direction
he
ducked
below
again
and
flippered
on
was
his
confusion
born
of
the
fog
or
was
it
also
in
his
head
did
he
after
all
have
this
much
reaction
to
the
gate
defense
ross
ducked
that
suspicion
as
he
had
ducked
the
moist
blanket
on
the
surface
he
had
come
from
the
gate
which
meant
that
the
jetty
must
lie
there
a
few
moments
later
ross
had
proof
that
his
sense
of
direction
had
not
altogether
failed
him
when
his
shoulder
grazed
against
a
solid
obstruction
in
the
water
and
his
exploring
touch
told
him
that
he
had
found
one
of
the
jetty
piles
he
surfaced
again
and
this
time
he
heard
not
a
thunder
roll
but
the
singsong
chanting
of
the
foanna
it
was
loud
almost
directly
above
his
head
but
since
the
cotton
mist
held
he
was
not
afraid
of
being
sighted
the
chanter
must
be
on
the
jetty
and
to
ross
right
was
a
dark
bulk
which
he
thought
was
one
of
the
cutters
was
a
sortie
by
the
besieged
being
planned
then
out
of
the
night
came
a
dazzling
beam
well
above
the
level
of
ross
head
where
he
clung
to
the
piling
it
centered
on
the
cutter
slicing
into
the
substance
of
the
vessel
with
the
ease
of
steel
piercing
clay
the
chanting
stopped
on
broken
by
cries
of
surprise
and
alarm
ross
pressing
against
the
pile
received
a
jolt
from
his
belt
sonic
there
must
be
a
baldy
sub
in
the
basin
inside
the
gate
perhaps
the
flame
beam
now
destroying
the
cutter
was
to
be
turned
on
the
walls
of
the
keep
in
turn
foanna
chant
again
low
and
clear
splashes
from
the
water
as
those
on
the
jetty
cast
into
the
sea
objects
ross
could
not
define
the
body
jerked
his
mask
smothered
a
cry
of
pain
about
his
legs
and
middle
immersed
in
the
waves
there
was
cold
so
intense
that
it
seared
fear
goaded
him
to
pull
up
on
one
of
the
under
beams
of
the
pier
he
reached
that
refuge
and
rubbed
his
icy
legs
with
what
vigor
he
could
summon
moments
later
he
crept
along
toward
the
shore
the
energy
ray
had
found
another
target
ross
paused
to
watch
a
second
cutter
sliced
if
the
counter
stroke
of
the
foanna
would
rout
the
invaders
it
had
not
yet
begun
to
work
the
net
holding
the
extra
gear
brought
along
in
hopes
of
ashe
escape
weighed
the
terran
down
but
he
would
not
abandon
it
as
he
felt
his
way
from
one
and
to
the
next
the
waves
below
gave
off
an
icy
exudation
which
made
him
shiver
uncontrollably
and
he
knew
that
as
long
as
that
effect
lasted
he
dared
not
venture
into
the
sea
again
light
along
with
the
cold
there
was
a
phosphorescence
on
the
water
white
patches
floating
dipping
riding
the
waves
some
of
them
gathered
under
the
pier
clustering
about
the
pilings
and
the
fog
thinned
with
their
coming
as
if
those
irregular
blotches
absorbed
and
fed
upon
the
mist
the
terran
could
see
now
he
had
reached
the
land
end
of
the
jetty
he
wedged
his
flippers
into
his
belt
pulled
on
over
his
feet
the
covers
of
torgul
had
provided
save
for
his
belt
his
trunks
and
the
ross
body
was
bare
and
the
cold
caught
at
him
but
slinging
the
carry
net
over
his
shoulder
he
dropped
to
the
damp
sand
and
stood
listening
the
clamor
of
the
attack
which
had
carried
all
the
way
offshore
to
the
rover
cruisers
had
died
away
and
there
were
no
more
claps
of
thunder
instead
there
was
now
a
thick
wash
of
rain
no
more
fire
rays
as
he
faced
seaward
and
the
fog
was
lifting
so
ross
could
distinguish
the
settling
cutters
their
bows
still
moored
to
the
jetty
there
was
no
movement
there
had
those
on
the
pier
fled
dot
dash
dot
ross
did
not
drop
the
net
but
he
crouched
back
in
the
half
protection
of
the
piling
for
a
moment
which
stretched
beyond
terran
time
measure
he
froze
so
waiting
dot
dash
dot
not
the
prickle
induced
by
the
enemy
installations
it
was
a
real
coded
call
picked
up
by
his
sonic
and
one
he
knew
do
rush
he
told
himself
sharply
play
it
safe
by
rights
only
two
people
in
this
time
and
place
would
know
that
call
and
one
would
have
no
reason
to
use
it
but
a
trap
this
could
be
a
trap
awe
of
the
foanna
powers
had
touched
him
a
little
in
spite
of
his
skepticism
he
could
be
lured
now
by
someone
using
ashe
call
ross
stripped
for
action
after
a
fashion
bundling
the
net
and
its
contents
into
a
hollow
he
scooped
behind
a
pile
well
above
water
level
the
alien
hand
weapon
he
had
left
with
karara
not
trusting
it
to
the
sea
but
he
had
his
diver
knife
and
his
two
hands
which
by
training
could
be
and
had
been
deadly
weapons
with
the
sonic
against
the
bare
skin
of
his
middle
where
it
would
register
strongest
knife
in
hand
ross
moved
into
the
open
the
floating
patches
did
not
supply
much
light
but
he
was
certain
the
call
had
come
from
the
jetty
there
was
movement
there
a
flash
or
two
and
the
sonic
ross
had
to
be
sure
very
sure
the
broadcast
was
certainly
stronger
when
he
faced
in
that
direction
dared
he
come
into
the
open
perhaps
in
the
dark
he
could
cut
ashe
away
from
his
captors
so
they
could
swim
for
it
together
ross
clicked
a
code
reply
dot
dot
dot
the
answer
was
quick
imperative
where
surely
no
one
but
ashe
could
have
sent
that
ross
did
not
hesitate
be
ready
escape
no
even
more
imperative
friends
here
had
he
guessed
rightly
had
ashe
established
friendly
relations
with
the
foanna
but
ross
kept
to
the
caution
which
had
been
his
defense
and
armor
so
long
there
was
one
question
he
thought
only
ashe
could
answer
something
out
of
the
past
they
had
shared
when
they
had
made
their
first
journey
into
time
disguised
as
beaker
traders
of
the
bronze
age
deliberately
he
tapped
that
question
what
did
we
kill
in
britain
tensely
he
waited
but
when
the
reply
came
it
did
not
pulse
from
the
sonic
under
his
fingers
instead
a
voice
called
out
of
the
night
a
white
wolf
and
the
words
were
terran
english
ashe
ross
leaped
forward
climbed
toward
the
figure
he
could
only
dimly
see
the
foanna
ross
ashe
hands
gripped
his
shoulders
as
if
never
intending
to
free
him
again
then
you
did
come
through
ross
understood
gordon
ashe
must
have
feared
that
he
was
the
only
one
swept
through
the
time
door
by
that
freak
chance
and
karara
and
the
dolphins
here
now
in
this
black
bowl
of
the
citadel
bay
ashe
was
only
a
shadow
with
voice
and
hands
no
out
with
the
rover
cruisers
ashe
do
you
know
the
baldies
are
on
hawaika
they
organized
this
whole
thing
the
attack
here
trouble
all
over
right
now
they
have
one
of
their
subs
out
there
that
what
cut
those
cutters
to
pieces
five
days
ago
five
of
them
wiped
out
a
whole
rover
fairing
just
five
of
them
gordoon
unlike
the
hissing
speech
of
the
hawaikans
this
new
voice
made
a
singing
lilting
call
of
ashe
name
this
is
your
swordsman
in
truth
another
shadow
drew
near
them
and
ross
saw
the
flutter
of
cloak
edge
this
is
my
friend
there
was
a
tone
of
correction
in
ashe
reply
ross
this
is
the
guardian
of
the
sea
gate
and
you
come
the
foanna
continued
with
those
who
gather
to
feast
at
the
shadow
table
but
your
rovers
will
find
little
loot
to
their
liking
no
ross
hesitated
how
did
one
address
the
foanna
he
had
claimed
equality
with
torgul
but
that
approach
was
not
the
proper
one
here
instinct
told
him
that
he
fell
back
on
the
complete
truth
uttered
simply
we
took
three
of
the
baldy
killers
from
them
we
learned
they
move
to
wipe
out
the
foanna
first
for
you
he
addressed
himself
to
the
cloaked
shape
they
believe
to
be
a
threat
we
heard
that
they
urged
the
wreckers
to
this
attack
and
so
and
so
the
rovers
come
but
not
to
loot
then
they
are
something
new
among
their
kind
the
foanna
reply
was
as
chill
as
the
sea
water
loot
does
not
summon
men
who
want
a
blood
price
for
their
dead
kin
ross
retorted
no
and
the
rovers
are
believers
in
the
balance
of
hurt
against
hurt
the
foanna
conceded
do
they
also
believe
in
the
balance
of
aid
against
aid
now
that
is
a
thought
upon
which
depends
much
gordoon
it
would
seem
that
we
may
not
take
to
our
ships
so
let
us
return
to
council
ashe
hand
was
on
ross
arm
guiding
him
through
the
murk
though
the
fog
which
had
choked
the
bay
had
vanished
thick
darkness
remained
and
ross
noted
that
even
the
fires
and
flares
were
dimmed
and
fewer
then
they
were
in
a
passage
where
a
very
faint
light
clung
to
the
walls
robed
foanna
three
of
them
moved
ahead
with
that
particular
gliding
progress
then
ashe
and
ross
and
bringing
up
the
rear
a
dozen
of
the
mailed
guards
the
passageway
became
a
ramp
ross
glanced
at
ashe
like
the
foanna
the
terran
agent
wore
a
cloak
of
gray
but
his
did
not
shift
color
from
time
to
time
as
did
those
of
the
hawaikan
enigmas
and
now
gordon
shoved
back
its
folds
revealing
supple
body
armor
questions
gathered
in
ross
he
wanted
to
know
needed
desperately
to
know
ashe
standing
with
the
foanna
what
had
happened
to
raise
gordon
from
the
status
of
captive
in
zahur
hold
to
familiar
companionship
with
the
most
dreaded
race
on
this
planet
the
ramp
head
faced
blank
wall
with
a
turn
to
the
right
of
a
narrower
passage
one
of
the
foanna
made
a
slight
sign
to
the
guards
who
turned
with
drilled
precision
to
march
off
along
the
passage
now
the
other
foanna
held
out
their
wands
what
a
moment
earlier
had
been
unbroken
surface
showed
an
opening
the
change
had
been
so
instantaneous
that
ross
had
not
seen
any
movement
at
all
beyond
that
door
they
passed
from
one
world
to
another
ross
senses
already
acutely
alert
to
his
surroundings
could
not
supply
him
with
any
reason
by
sight
sound
or
smell
for
his
firm
conviction
that
this
hold
was
alien
as
neither
the
wrecker
castle
nor
the
rover
ships
had
been
surely
the
foanna
were
not
the
same
race
perhaps
not
even
the
same
species
as
the
other
native
hawaikans
those
robes
which
he
had
seen
both
silver
gray
and
dark
blue
now
faded
pearled
thinned
until
each
of
the
three
still
gliding
before
him
were
opalescent
columns
without
definite
form
ashe
grasp
fell
on
ross
arm
once
more
and
his
whisper
reached
the
younger
man
thinly
they
are
mistresses
of
illusion
be
prepared
not
to
believe
all
that
you
see
mistresses
ross
caught
that
first
women
or
at
least
female
then
illusion
yes
already
he
was
convinced
that
here
his
eyes
could
play
tricks
on
him
he
could
hardly
determine
what
was
robe
what
was
wall
or
if
more
than
shades
of
shades
swept
before
him
another
blank
wall
then
an
opening
and
flowing
through
it
to
touch
him
such
a
wave
of
alienness
that
ross
felt
he
was
buffeted
by
a
storm
wind
yet
as
he
hesitated
before
it
reluctant
in
spite
of
ashe
hold
to
go
ahead
he
also
knew
that
this
did
not
carry
with
it
the
cold
hostility
he
had
known
while
facing
the
baldies
alien
yes
inimical
to
his
kind
no
you
are
right
younger
brother
spoken
those
words
or
forming
in
his
mind
ross
was
in
a
place
which
was
sheer
wonder
under
his
feet
dark
blue
the
blue
of
a
terran
sky
at
dusk
caught
up
in
it
twinkling
points
of
light
as
if
he
strode
not
equal
with
stars
but
above
them
walls
were
there
any
walls
here
or
shifting
swaying
blue
curtains
on
which
silvery
lines
ran
to
form
symbols
and
words
which
some
bemused
part
of
his
brain
almost
understood
but
not
quite
constant
motion
no
quiet
until
he
came
to
a
place
where
those
swaying
curtains
were
stilled
where
he
no
longer
strode
above
the
sky
but
on
soft
surface
a
mat
of
gray
living
sod
where
his
steps
released
a
spicy
fragrance
and
there
he
really
saw
the
foanna
for
the
first
time
where
had
their
cloaks
gone
had
they
tossed
them
away
during
that
walk
or
drift
across
this
amazing
room
or
had
the
substance
which
had
formed
those
coverings
flowed
away
by
itself
as
ross
looked
at
the
three
in
wonder
he
knew
that
he
was
seeing
them
as
not
even
their
servants
and
guards
ever
viewed
them
and
yet
was
he
seeing
them
as
they
really
were
or
as
they
wished
him
to
see
them
as
we
are
younger
brother
as
we
are
again
an
answer
which
ross
was
not
sure
was
thought
or
speech
in
form
they
were
humanoid
and
they
were
undoubtedly
women
the
muffling
cloaks
gone
they
wore
sleeveless
garments
of
silver
which
were
girded
at
the
waist
with
belts
of
blue
gems
only
in
their
hair
and
their
eyes
did
they
betray
alien
blood
for
the
hair
which
flowed
and
wove
about
them
cascading
down
shoulders
rippling
about
their
arms
was
silver
too
and
it
swirled
moved
as
if
it
had
a
separate
life
of
its
own
while
their
eyes
ross
looked
into
those
golden
eyes
and
was
lost
for
seconds
until
panic
awoke
in
him
forcing
him
after
sharp
struggle
to
look
away
laughter
no
he
had
not
heard
laughter
but
a
sense
of
amusement
tinged
with
respect
came
to
him
you
are
very
right
gordoon
this
one
is
also
of
your
kind
he
is
not
witches
meat
ross
caught
the
distaste
the
kind
of
haunting
unhappiness
which
colored
those
words
remnants
of
an
old
hurt
these
are
the
foanna
ashe
voice
broke
more
of
the
spell
the
lady
ynlan
the
lady
yngram
the
lady
ynvalda
the
foanna
these
three
only
she
whom
ashe
had
named
ynlan
whose
eyes
had
entrapped
and
almost
held
what
was
ross
murdock
made
a
small
gesture
with
her
ivory
hand
and
in
that
gesture
as
well
as
in
the
words
witches
meat
the
terran
read
the
unhappiness
which
was
as
much
a
part
of
this
room
as
the
rest
of
its
mystery
the
foanna
are
now
but
three
they
have
been
only
three
for
many
weary
years
oh
man
from
another
world
and
time
and
soon
if
these
enemies
have
their
way
they
will
not
be
three
but
none
but
ross
was
still
startled
he
knew
from
loketh
that
the
wreckers
had
deemed
the
foanna
few
in
number
an
old
and
dying
race
but
that
there
were
only
three
women
left
was
hard
to
believe
the
response
to
his
unspoken
wonder
came
clear
and
determined
we
may
be
but
three
however
our
power
remains
and
sometimes
power
distilled
by
time
becomes
the
stronger
now
it
would
seem
that
time
is
no
longer
our
servant
but
perhaps
among
our
enemies
so
tell
us
this
tale
of
yours
as
to
why
the
rovers
would
make
one
with
the
foanna
tell
us
all
younger
brother
ross
reported
what
he
had
seen
what
and
taua
had
learned
from
the
prisoners
taken
at
kyn
add
and
when
he
had
finished
the
three
foanna
stood
very
still
their
hands
clasped
one
to
the
other
though
they
were
only
an
arm
distance
from
him
ross
had
the
feeling
they
had
withdrawn
from
his
time
and
world
so
complete
was
their
withdrawal
that
he
dared
to
ask
ashe
one
of
the
many
questions
which
had
been
boiling
inside
him
who
are
they
but
ross
knew
he
really
meant
what
are
they
gordon
ashe
shook
his
head
i
do
really
know
the
last
of
a
very
old
race
which
possesses
powers
and
knowledge
different
from
any
we
have
believed
in
for
centuries
we
have
heard
of
witches
in
the
modern
day
we
discount
the
legends
about
them
the
foanna
bring
those
legends
alive
and
i
promise
you
this
if
they
turn
those
powers
loose
he
paused
it
will
be
such
a
war
as
this
world
perhaps
any
world
has
never
seen
that
is
so
the
foanna
had
returned
from
the
place
to
which
they
had
withdrawn
and
this
is
also
the
truth
or
one
face
of
the
truth
the
rovers
are
right
in
their
belief
that
we
have
kept
some
measure
of
balance
between
one
form
of
change
and
another
on
this
world
if
we
were
as
many
as
we
once
were
then
against
us
these
invaders
could
not
move
at
all
but
we
are
three
only
and
also
do
we
have
the
right
to
evoke
disaster
which
will
strike
not
only
the
enemy
but
perhaps
recoil
upon
the
innocent
there
has
been
enough
death
here
already
and
those
who
are
our
servants
shall
no
longer
be
asked
to
face
battle
to
keep
an
empty
shell
inviolate
we
would
see
with
our
own
eyes
these
invaders
probe
what
they
would
do
there
is
ever
change
in
life
and
if
a
pattern
grows
too
set
then
the
race
caught
in
it
may
wither
and
die
maybe
our
pattern
has
been
too
long
in
its
old
design
we
shall
make
no
decision
until
we
see
in
whose
hands
the
future
may
rest
against
such
finality
of
argument
there
was
no
appeal
these
could
not
be
influenced
by
words
gordoon
there
is
much
to
be
done
do
you
take
with
you
this
younger
brother
and
see
to
his
needs
when
all
is
in
readiness
we
shall
come
one
minute
ross
had
been
standing
on
the
carpet
of
living
moss
then
he
was
in
a
more
normal
room
with
four
walls
a
floor
a
ceiling
and
light
which
came
from
rods
set
in
the
corners
he
gasped
stunned
me
too
the
first
time
they
put
me
through
it
he
heard
ashe
say
here
get
some
of
this
inside
you
it
steady
your
head
there
was
a
cup
in
his
hand
a
beautifully
carved
container
shaped
in
the
form
of
a
flower
somehow
ross
brought
it
to
his
lips
with
shaking
hands
gulped
down
a
good
third
of
its
contents
the
liquid
was
a
mixture
of
tart
and
sweet
cooling
his
mouth
and
throat
but
warming
as
it
went
down
and
that
glow
spread
through
him
what
how
did
they
do
that
he
demanded
ashe
shrugged
how
do
they
do
the
hundred
and
one
things
i
have
seen
happen
here
we
been
teleported
how
it
done
i
do
know
any
more
than
i
did
the
first
time
it
happened
simply
a
part
of
foanna
as
far
as
spectators
are
concerned
he
sat
down
on
a
stool
his
long
legs
stretched
out
before
him
other
worlds
other
ways
even
if
they
are
confounded
queer
ones
as
far
as
i
know
there
no
reason
for
their
power
to
work
but
it
does
now
have
you
seen
the
time
gate
is
it
in
working
order
ross
put
down
the
now
empty
cup
and
sat
down
opposite
ashe
as
concisely
as
he
could
he
outlined
the
situation
with
a
quick
résumé
of
all
that
had
happened
to
him
karara
and
the
dolphins
since
they
had
been
sucked
through
the
gate
ashe
asked
no
questions
but
his
expression
was
that
of
the
agent
ross
had
known
evaluating
and
listing
all
the
younger
man
had
to
report
when
the
other
was
through
he
said
only
two
words
no
return
so
much
had
happened
in
so
short
a
time
that
ross
initial
shock
at
the
destruction
of
the
gate
had
faded
been
well
overlaid
by
all
the
demands
made
upon
his
resources
skill
and
strength
even
now
the
fact
ashe
voiced
seemed
of
little
consequence
balanced
against
the
struggle
in
progress
ashe
ross
rubbed
his
hands
up
and
down
his
arms
brushing
away
grains
of
sand
remember
those
pylons
with
the
empty
seacoast
behind
them
does
that
mean
the
baldies
are
going
to
win
i
do
know
no
one
has
ever
tried
to
change
the
course
of
history
maybe
it
is
impossible
even
if
we
dared
to
try
ashe
was
on
his
feet
again
pacing
back
and
forth
try
what
gordoon
ross
jerked
around
ashe
halted
one
of
the
foanna
stood
there
her
hair
playing
about
her
shoulders
as
if
some
breeze
felt
only
by
her
stirred
those
long
strands
dare
to
try
and
change
the
course
of
the
future
ashe
explained
accepting
her
materialization
with
the
calm
of
one
who
had
witnessed
it
before
ah
yes
your
traveling
in
time
and
now
you
think
that
perhaps
this
poor
world
of
ours
has
a
choice
as
to
which
overlords
it
will
welcome
i
do
not
know
either
gordoon
whether
the
future
may
be
altered
nor
if
it
be
wise
to
try
but
also
well
perhaps
we
should
see
our
enemy
before
we
are
set
in
any
path
now
it
is
time
that
we
go
younger
brother
how
did
you
plan
to
leave
this
place
when
you
accomplished
your
mission
by
the
sea
gate
i
have
extra
swimming
equipment
cached
under
the
jetty
and
the
rover
ships
await
you
at
sea
yes
then
we
shall
take
your
way
since
the
cutters
are
sunk
there
is
only
one
extra
and
that
baldy
sub
is
out
there
too
so
then
we
shall
try
another
road
though
it
will
sap
our
power
temporarily
her
head
inclined
slightly
to
the
left
as
if
she
listened
good
our
people
are
now
in
the
passage
which
will
take
them
to
safety
what
those
outside
will
find
here
when
they
break
in
will
be
of
little
aid
to
their
plans
secrets
of
the
foanna
remain
secrets
past
prying
though
they
shall
try
oh
how
they
shall
try
to
solve
them
there
is
knowledge
that
only
certain
types
of
minds
can
hold
and
use
and
to
others
it
remains
for
all
time
unlearnable
now
her
hand
reached
out
flattened
against
ross
forehead
think
of
your
rover
ship
younger
brother
see
it
in
your
mind
and
see
well
and
clearly
for
me
torgul
cruiser
was
there
he
could
picture
with
details
he
had
not
thought
he
knew
or
remembered
the
deck
in
the
dark
of
the
night
with
only
a
shaded
light
at
the
mast
the
deck
ross
gave
a
choked
cry
he
did
not
see
this
in
his
mind
he
saw
it
with
his
eyes
his
hand
swung
out
in
an
involuntary
gesture
of
repudiation
and
struck
painfully
against
wood
he
was
on
the
cruiser
a
startled
exclamation
from
behind
him
then
a
shout
ashe
was
here
and
beyond
him
three
cloaked
figures
the
foanna
they
had
their
own
road
indeed
and
had
taken
it
you
rosss
vistur
fronted
them
his
face
a
mixture
of
bewilderment
and
awe
the
foanna
said
in
a
half
whisper
echoed
by
crewmen
gathering
around
but
not
too
close
gordon
karara
elbowed
her
way
between
two
of
the
hawaikans
and
ran
across
the
deck
she
caught
the
agent
both
hands
as
if
to
assure
herself
that
he
was
alive
and
there
before
her
then
she
turned
to
the
three
foanna
there
was
an
odd
expression
on
the
polynesian
girl
face
first
of
measurement
with
some
fear
and
then
of
dawning
wonder
from
beneath
the
cloak
of
the
middle
foanna
came
the
rod
of
office
with
its
sparking
knob
karara
dropped
ashe
hands
took
a
tentative
step
forward
and
then
another
the
knob
was
directly
before
her
breast
high
she
brought
up
both
hands
cupping
them
about
the
knob
but
not
touching
it
directly
the
sparks
it
emitted
could
have
been
flashing
against
her
flesh
but
karara
displayed
no
awareness
of
that
instead
she
lifted
both
hands
farther
palm
up
and
cupped
as
if
she
carried
some
invisible
bounty
then
flattened
them
loosing
what
she
held
there
was
a
sigh
from
the
crewmen
karara
gesture
had
been
confident
as
if
she
knew
just
what
she
was
doing
and
why
and
ross
heard
ashe
draw
a
deep
breath
also
as
the
terran
girl
turned
allying
herself
with
the
foanna
these
great
ones
stand
in
peace
she
said
it
is
their
will
that
no
harm
comes
to
this
ship
and
those
who
sail
in
her
what
do
the
great
ones
want
of
us
torgul
advanced
but
not
too
near
to
speak
concerning
those
who
are
your
prisoners
so
be
it
the
captain
bowed
the
great
ones
will
is
our
will
let
it
be
as
they
wish
return
to
the
battle
ross
lay
listening
to
the
even
breathing
from
across
the
cabin
he
had
awakened
in
that
quick
transference
from
sleep
to
consciousness
which
was
always
his
when
on
duty
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
move
ashe
was
still
sleeping
ashe
whom
he
thought
or
had
thought
he
knew
as
well
as
one
man
could
ever
know
another
who
had
taken
the
place
of
family
for
ross
murdock
the
loner
years
two
four
of
them
now
since
he
had
made
half
of
that
partnership
his
head
turned
though
he
could
not
see
that
lean
body
that
quiet
controlled
face
ashe
still
looked
the
same
but
ross
sense
of
loss
was
hurt
and
anger
mingled
what
had
they
done
to
gordon
those
three
bewitched
tales
terrans
had
accepted
as
purest
fantasy
for
centuries
came
into
his
mind
could
it
be
that
his
own
world
once
had
its
foanna
ross
scowled
you
could
refute
their
magic
call
it
by
what
scientific
name
you
wished
hypnotism
telaporting
they
got
results
and
the
results
were
impressive
now
he
remembered
the
warning
the
foanna
themselves
had
delivered
hours
earlier
to
the
rovers
there
were
limits
to
their
abilities
because
they
were
forced
to
draw
on
mental
and
physical
energy
they
could
be
exhausted
thus
they
had
barriers
too
again
ross
considered
the
subject
of
barriers
karara
had
been
able
to
meet
the
aliens
if
not
then
in
a
closer
way
even
than
ashe
the
talent
which
tied
her
to
the
dolphins
had
in
turn
been
a
bond
with
the
foanna
ashe
and
karara
could
enter
that
circle
but
not
ross
murdock
along
with
his
new
separation
from
ashe
came
that
feeling
of
inferiority
to
bite
on
and
the
taste
was
sour
this
is
going
to
be
easy
so
ashe
was
awake
what
can
they
do
ross
asked
in
return
i
do
know
i
do
believe
that
they
can
telaport
an
army
into
baldy
headquarters
the
way
torgul
expects
and
it
would
do
such
an
army
much
good
to
get
there
and
then
be
outclassed
by
the
weapons
the
baldies
might
have
ashe
said
ross
had
a
moment
of
warmth
and
comfort
he
knew
that
tone
of
old
ashe
was
studying
the
problem
willing
to
talk
out
difficulties
as
he
always
had
before
no
outright
assault
is
the
answer
we
have
to
know
more
about
the
enemy
one
thing
puzzles
me
why
have
the
baldies
suddenly
stepped
up
their
timing
what
makes
you
think
they
have
well
according
to
the
accounts
i
heard
it
been
about
three
or
four
planet
years
here
since
some
devices
have
been
infiltrating
the
native
civilization
you
mean
such
things
as
those
attractors
set
up
on
the
reef
at
castle
ross
remembered
loketh
story
those
and
other
things
the
refinements
added
to
the
engine
power
on
these
ships
torgul
said
they
spread
from
rover
fleet
to
fleet
no
one
sure
where
they
started
the
baldies
began
slowly
but
they
are
speeding
up
now
those
fairing
attacks
have
all
been
recent
and
this
assault
on
the
foanna
citadel
blew
up
almost
overnight
on
a
flimsy
excuse
why
the
quick
push
after
the
slow
beginning
maybe
they
decided
the
natives
are
easy
pushovers
and
they
no
longer
have
to
worry
about
any
real
opposition
ross
suggested
could
be
becoming
arrogance
when
they
did
uncover
any
opponent
strong
enough
to
matter
or
else
they
may
be
spurred
by
some
need
with
a
time
limit
if
we
knew
the
reason
for
those
pylons
we
might
guess
their
motives
are
you
going
to
try
to
change
the
future
that
sounds
arrogant
too
can
we
if
we
wish
to
we
never
dared
to
try
it
on
terra
and
the
risk
may
be
worse
than
all
our
fears
also
the
choice
is
not
ours
there
one
thing
i
do
understand
ross
said
why
did
the
foanna
walk
out
of
the
citadel
and
leave
it
undefended
for
their
enemies
what
about
their
guards
did
they
just
leave
them
too
he
was
willing
to
make
the
most
of
any
flaw
in
the
aliens
character
most
of
their
people
had
already
escaped
through
underground
ways
the
rest
left
when
they
knew
the
cutters
had
been
sunk
ashe
returned
as
to
why
they
deserted
the
citadel
i
do
know
the
decision
was
theirs
there
up
with
the
barrier
between
them
again
but
ross
refused
to
accept
the
cutoff
this
time
determined
to
pull
ashe
back
into
the
familiar
world
of
the
here
and
now
that
keep
could
be
a
trap
about
the
best
on
this
planet
the
idea
was
more
than
just
a
gambit
to
attract
ashe
attention
it
was
true
a
perfect
trap
to
catch
baldies
do
you
see
ross
sat
up
slapped
his
feet
down
on
the
deck
as
he
leaned
forward
eagerly
do
you
see
if
the
baldies
know
anything
at
all
about
the
foanna
and
i
betting
they
do
and
want
to
learn
all
they
can
they
visit
the
citadel
they
wo
want
to
depend
on
and
reports
of
the
place
especially
ones
delivered
by
primitives
such
as
the
wreckers
they
had
a
sub
there
i
bet
the
crew
are
in
picking
over
the
loot
right
now
if
that
what
they
hunting
there
was
amusement
in
tone
they
wo
find
much
the
foanna
have
better
locks
than
their
enemies
have
keys
you
heard
ynlan
before
we
left
any
secrets
left
will
remain
secrets
but
there
bait
bait
for
a
trap
argued
ross
you
right
to
the
younger
man
joy
ashe
enthusiasm
was
plain
and
if
the
baldies
could
be
led
to
believe
that
what
they
wanted
was
obtainable
with
just
a
little
more
effort
or
the
right
tools
the
trap
could
net
bigger
catch
than
just
underlings
ross
thought
matched
ashe
why
it
might
even
pull
in
the
vip
directing
the
whole
operation
how
can
we
set
it
up
and
do
we
have
time
the
trap
would
have
to
be
of
foanna
setting
our
part
would
come
after
it
was
sprung
ashe
was
thoughtful
again
but
it
is
the
only
move
which
we
can
make
at
present
with
any
hope
of
success
and
it
will
only
work
if
the
foanna
are
willing
have
to
be
done
quickly
ross
pointed
out
yes
i
see
ashe
was
a
dark
figure
against
the
thin
light
of
the
companionway
as
he
slid
back
the
cabin
door
if
ynvalda
agrees
as
he
went
out
ross
was
right
behind
him
the
foanna
had
been
given
by
their
own
choice
quarters
on
the
bow
deck
of
the
cruiser
where
sailcloth
had
been
used
to
form
a
tent
not
that
any
of
the
rovers
would
venture
too
near
them
ashe
reached
for
the
flap
of
the
fabric
and
a
lilting
voice
called
you
seek
us
gordoon
this
is
important
yes
it
is
important
for
the
thought
which
brings
you
both
has
merit
enter
then
brothers
the
flap
was
looped
aside
and
before
them
was
a
swirling
of
mist
light
sheets
of
pale
color
ross
could
not
have
described
what
he
saw
save
if
the
foanna
were
there
he
could
not
distinguish
them
from
the
rippling
of
their
hair
the
melting
film
of
their
robes
so
younger
brother
you
think
that
which
was
our
home
and
our
treasure
box
has
now
become
a
trap
for
the
confounding
of
those
who
believe
we
are
a
threat
to
them
somehow
ross
was
not
surprised
that
they
knew
about
his
idea
before
he
had
said
a
word
before
ashe
had
given
any
explanations
their
omniscience
was
only
a
small
portion
of
their
other
talents
yes
and
why
do
you
believe
so
we
swear
to
you
that
the
coast
folk
can
not
be
driven
into
those
parts
of
the
castle
which
mean
the
most
any
more
than
our
sea
gate
can
be
breached
unless
we
will
it
so
yet
i
swam
through
the
sea
gate
and
the
sub
was
there
also
ross
knew
again
a
flash
of
was
it
pleasure
at
being
able
to
state
this
fact
there
chinks
in
the
foanna
defenses
again
the
truth
you
have
that
within
you
young
brother
which
is
both
a
lack
and
a
shield
true
also
that
this
underseas
ship
entered
after
you
perhaps
it
has
a
shield
as
part
of
it
perhaps
those
from
the
stars
have
their
own
protection
but
they
can
not
reach
the
heart
of
what
they
wish
not
unless
we
open
the
doors
for
them
it
is
your
belief
younger
brother
that
they
still
strive
to
force
such
doors
yes
knowing
there
is
something
to
be
learned
they
will
try
for
it
they
will
not
dare
not
to
ross
was
very
certain
on
that
point
his
encounters
with
the
baldies
had
not
led
to
any
real
understanding
but
the
way
they
had
wiped
out
the
line
of
russian
time
stations
made
him
sure
that
they
dealt
thoroughly
with
any
situation
they
considered
a
threat
from
the
prisoners
taken
at
kyn
add
they
had
learned
the
invaders
believed
the
foanna
their
enemies
here
even
though
the
old
ones
had
not
repulsed
them
or
their
activities
therefore
it
followed
that
having
taken
the
stronghold
the
baldies
would
endeavor
to
rip
open
every
one
of
its
secrets
a
trap
with
good
bait
ross
wondered
which
one
of
the
foanna
said
that
to
see
nothing
but
the
swirls
of
listen
to
disembodied
voices
from
it
was
disconcerting
part
of
the
stage
dressing
he
decided
for
building
their
prestige
with
the
other
races
with
whom
they
dealt
three
women
alone
would
have
to
buttress
their
authority
with
such
trappings
ah
younger
brother
indeed
you
are
beginning
to
understand
us
laughter
soft
but
unmistakable
ross
frowned
he
did
not
feel
the
of
mental
communication
which
the
dolphins
used
but
he
did
not
doubt
that
the
foanna
read
his
thoughts
or
at
least
a
few
of
them
some
of
them
echoed
from
the
mist
not
all
not
as
your
older
brother
or
the
maiden
whose
mind
meets
with
ours
with
you
younger
brother
it
is
a
thought
here
a
thought
there
and
only
our
intuition
to
connect
them
into
a
pattern
but
now
there
is
serious
planning
to
be
done
and
knowing
this
enemy
you
believe
they
will
come
to
search
for
what
they
can
not
find
so
you
would
set
a
trap
but
they
have
weapons
beyond
your
weapons
have
they
not
younger
brother
brave
as
are
these
rover
kind
they
can
not
use
swords
against
flame
their
hands
against
a
killer
who
may
stand
apart
and
slay
what
remains
gordoon
what
remains
in
our
favor
you
have
your
weapons
too
ashe
answered
yes
we
have
our
weapons
but
long
have
they
been
used
only
in
one
pattern
and
they
are
atuned
to
another
race
did
our
defenses
hold
against
you
gordoon
when
you
strove
to
prove
that
you
were
as
you
claimed
to
be
and
did
another
repulse
younger
brother
when
he
dared
the
sea
gate
so
can
we
trust
them
in
turn
against
these
other
strangers
with
different
brains
only
at
the
testing
shall
we
know
and
in
such
learning
perhaps
we
shall
also
be
forced
to
eat
the
sourness
of
defeat
to
risk
all
may
be
to
lose
all
that
may
be
true
ashe
assented
you
mean
the
sight
you
have
had
into
our
future
says
that
this
happens
yes
to
stake
all
and
to
lose
not
only
for
ourselves
but
for
all
others
here
that
is
a
weighty
decision
to
make
gordoon
but
the
trap
promises
let
us
think
on
it
for
a
space
do
you
also
consult
with
the
rovers
if
they
wish
to
take
part
in
what
may
be
desperate
folly
torgul
paced
the
afterdeck
well
away
from
the
tent
which
sheltered
the
foanna
but
with
his
eyes
turning
to
it
as
ross
explained
what
might
be
a
good
attack
those
would
have
no
fear
of
foanna
magic
rather
would
they
come
to
seek
it
out
it
would
be
a
chance
to
catch
leaders
in
a
trap
you
have
heard
what
the
prisoners
said
or
thought
yes
they
would
seek
out
such
knowledge
and
we
would
have
this
chance
to
capture
them
with
what
torgul
demanded
i
am
not
ongal
to
argue
that
it
is
better
to
die
in
pursuit
of
blood
payment
than
to
take
an
enemy
or
enemies
with
me
what
chance
have
we
against
their
powers
ask
that
of
them
ross
nodded
toward
the
still
silent
tent
even
as
he
spoke
the
three
cloaked
foanna
emerged
pacing
down
to
where
torgul
and
his
lieutenants
ross
and
ashe
came
to
meet
them
we
have
thought
on
this
the
lilting
half
chant
which
the
foanna
used
for
ordinary
communication
was
a
song
in
the
dawn
wind
it
was
in
our
minds
to
retreat
to
wait
out
this
troubling
of
the
land
since
we
are
few
and
that
which
we
hold
within
us
is
worth
the
guarding
but
now
what
profit
such
guardianship
when
there
may
be
none
to
whom
we
may
pass
it
after
us
and
if
you
have
seen
the
truth
elder
brother
the
cowled
heads
swung
to
ashe
then
there
may
be
no
future
for
any
of
us
but
still
there
are
our
limitations
rover
now
they
spoke
directly
to
torgul
we
can
not
put
your
men
within
the
citadel
by
desiring
not
without
certain
aids
which
lie
sealed
there
now
no
we
ourselves
must
win
inside
bodily
and
then
then
perhaps
we
can
pull
tight
the
lines
of
our
net
to
run
a
cruiser
through
the
gate
torgul
began
no
not
a
ship
captain
a
handful
of
warriors
in
the
water
can
risk
the
gate
but
not
a
ship
ashe
broke
in
how
many
do
we
have
ross
counted
hurriedly
i
left
one
cached
ashore
but
there
mine
and
karara
and
loketh
also
two
more
to
pass
the
gates
that
was
the
foanna
we
ourselves
shall
not
need
your
underwater
aids
you
ross
said
to
ashe
and
i
with
karara
pack
for
karara
both
the
terrans
looked
around
the
polynesian
girl
stood
close
to
the
foanna
smiling
faintly
this
venture
is
mine
also
she
spoke
with
conviction
as
it
is
and
taua
is
that
not
so
daughters
of
the
alii
of
this
world
yes
sea
maid
there
are
weapons
of
many
sorts
and
not
all
of
them
fit
into
a
warrior
hand
or
can
be
swung
with
the
force
of
a
man
arm
and
shoulder
yes
this
venture
is
yours
also
sister
ross
protests
bubbled
unspoken
he
had
to
accept
the
finality
of
the
foanna
decree
it
seemed
now
that
the
of
their
task
force
depended
upon
the
whims
of
the
three
rather
than
the
experience
of
those
trained
to
such
risks
and
ashe
was
apparently
willing
to
accept
their
leadership
so
it
was
an
odd
company
that
took
to
the
water
just
as
dawn
colored
the
sky
loketh
had
clung
fiercely
to
his
pack
insisted
that
he
be
one
of
the
swimmers
and
the
foanna
accepted
him
as
well
ross
and
ashe
loketh
and
baleku
a
young
of
ongal
accorded
the
best
swimmer
of
the
fleet
karara
and
the
dolphins
and
with
them
those
three
others
shapes
sliding
smoothly
through
the
water
as
difficult
to
define
in
this
new
element
as
they
had
been
in
their
tent
before
them
frisked
the
dolphins
and
taua
played
about
the
foanna
in
an
ecstatic
joy
and
when
all
were
in
the
sea
they
shot
off
shoreward
that
sub
within
the
sea
gate
had
it
unleashed
the
same
lethal
broadcast
as
the
one
at
kyn
add
but
the
dolphins
could
give
warning
if
that
were
so
ross
swam
easily
ashe
next
loketh
on
his
left
baleku
a
little
behind
and
karara
to
the
fore
as
if
in
vain
pursuit
of
the
dolphins
the
foanna
well
to
the
left
a
queer
invasion
party
even
queerer
when
one
totaled
up
the
odds
which
might
lie
ahead
there
was
no
mist
or
storm
this
morning
to
hide
the
headlands
where
the
foanna
citadel
stood
and
the
promontories
of
the
sea
gate
were
starkly
clear
in
the
growing
light
the
same
drive
which
always
was
a
part
of
ross
when
he
was
committed
to
action
sustained
him
now
though
he
was
visited
by
a
small
prick
of
doubt
when
he
thought
that
the
leadership
did
not
lie
with
ashe
but
with
the
foanna
no
warning
of
any
trouble
ahead
as
they
passed
between
the
mighty
bases
of
the
gate
pillars
ross
depended
upon
his
sonic
but
there
was
no
adverse
report
from
the
sensitive
recorder
the
terrible
chill
of
the
water
during
the
night
attack
had
been
dissipated
but
here
and
there
dead
sea
things
floated
being
torn
and
devoured
by
hunters
of
the
waves
they
were
well
past
the
pillars
when
ross
was
aware
that
loketh
had
changed
place
in
the
line
spurting
ahead
after
him
went
baleku
they
caught
up
with
karara
flashed
past
her
ross
looked
to
ashe
on
to
the
foanna
but
saw
nothing
to
explain
the
action
of
the
two
hawaikans
then
his
sonic
beat
out
a
signal
from
ashe
danger
follow
the
foanna
left
karara
had
already
changed
course
to
head
in
that
direction
ahead
of
her
he
could
see
loketh
and
baleku
both
still
bound
for
the
of
the
shore
where
the
jetty
and
the
sunken
cutters
were
ashe
passed
before
him
and
ross
reluctantly
followed
orders
a
shelf
of
rock
reached
out
from
the
cliff
wall
under
it
a
dark
opening
the
foanna
sought
this
without
hesitation
ashe
karara
and
ross
following
moments
later
they
were
out
of
the
water
where
footing
sloped
back
and
up
below
them
and
taua
nosed
the
rise
their
heads
lifting
out
of
the
water
as
they
spoke
and
karara
hastened
to
reply
loketh
baleku
ross
began
when
he
caught
a
mental
stroke
of
anger
so
deadly
that
it
was
a
chill
lance
into
his
brain
he
faced
the
foanna
startled
and
a
little
frightened
they
will
not
come
now
a
wand
stretched
out
in
the
air
pointing
to
the
upper
reaches
of
the
slope
nor
can
any
of
their
blood
unless
we
win
what
is
wrong
ashe
asked
you
were
right
very
right
men
out
of
time
these
invaders
are
not
to
be
lightly
dismissed
they
have
turned
one
of
our
own
defenses
against
us
loketh
baleku
all
of
their
kind
can
be
made
into
tools
for
a
master
they
belong
to
the
enemy
now
and
we
have
failed
so
early
karara
wanted
to
know
again
that
piercing
thrust
of
anger
so
vivid
that
it
was
no
mere
emotion
but
seemed
a
tangible
force
failed
no
not
yet
have
we
even
begun
to
fight
you
were
very
right
this
is
such
an
evil
as
must
be
faced
and
fought
even
if
we
lose
all
in
battle
now
we
must
do
that
which
none
of
our
own
race
has
done
for
generations
we
must
open
three
locks
throw
wide
the
great
door
and
seek
out
the
keeper
of
the
closed
knowledge
light
a
sharp
ray
sighting
from
the
tip
of
the
wand
and
the
foanna
following
that
beam
the
three
terrans
coming
after
into
the
unknown
the
opening
of
the
great
door
it
was
not
the
general
airlessness
of
the
passage
which
wore
on
ross
nerves
made
karara
suddenly
reach
out
and
clasp
fingers
about
the
wrists
of
the
two
men
she
walked
between
it
was
a
crushing
sensation
of
age
of
a
toll
of
years
so
long
so
heavy
as
to
make
time
itself
into
a
turgid
flood
which
tugged
at
their
bodies
mired
their
feet
as
they
trudged
after
the
foanna
this
sense
of
age
of
a
dead
and
heavy
past
was
so
stifling
that
all
three
terrans
breathed
in
gasps
karara
breaths
became
sobs
yet
she
matched
her
pace
to
ashe
and
ross
kept
going
ross
himself
had
little
idea
of
their
surroundings
but
one
small
portion
of
his
brain
asked
answerless
questions
the
foremost
being
why
did
the
past
crush
in
on
him
here
he
had
traveled
time
but
never
before
had
he
been
beaten
with
the
feel
of
countless
dead
and
dying
years
going
back
that
hoarse
whisper
came
from
ashe
and
ross
thought
he
understood
a
time
gate
he
was
eager
to
accept
such
an
explanation
time
gates
he
could
understand
but
that
the
foanna
used
one
not
our
kind
ashe
replied
but
his
words
had
pulled
ross
out
of
a
spell
which
had
been
as
quicksand
about
him
and
he
began
to
fight
back
with
a
determination
not
to
be
sucked
into
what
filled
this
place
in
spite
of
ross
efforts
his
eyes
could
supply
him
with
no
definite
impression
of
where
they
were
the
ramp
had
led
them
out
of
the
sea
but
where
they
walked
now
linked
hand
to
hand
ross
could
not
say
he
could
see
the
glimmer
of
the
foanna
turning
his
head
he
could
see
his
companions
as
shadows
but
all
beyond
that
was
utter
dark
ahhhh
karara
sobs
gave
way
to
a
whisper
which
was
half
moan
this
is
a
way
of
gods
old
gods
gods
who
never
dealt
with
men
it
is
not
well
to
walk
the
road
of
the
gods
her
fear
lapped
to
ross
he
faced
that
emotion
as
he
had
faced
so
many
different
kinds
of
fear
all
his
life
sure
he
felt
that
pressure
on
him
not
the
pressure
of
past
centuries
now
but
a
power
beyond
his
ability
to
describe
not
our
gods
ross
put
his
stubborn
defiance
into
words
more
as
a
shield
against
his
own
wavering
no
power
where
there
is
no
belief
from
what
bit
of
reading
had
he
dredged
that
knowledge
no
being
without
belief
he
repeated
to
his
vast
amazement
he
heard
ashe
laugh
though
the
sound
bordered
on
hysteria
no
belief
no
power
the
older
man
replied
you
speared
the
right
fish
ross
no
gods
of
ours
dwell
here
karara
and
whatever
god
does
has
no
rights
over
us
hold
to
that
girl
hold
tight
ah
ye
forty
thousand
gods
ye
gods
of
sea
of
sky
of
woods
of
mountains
of
valleys
ye
assemblies
of
gods
ye
elder
brothers
of
the
gods
that
are
ye
gods
that
once
were
ye
that
whisper
ye
that
watch
by
night
ye
that
show
your
gleaming
eyes
come
down
awake
stir
walk
this
road
walk
this
road
she
was
singing
first
softly
and
then
more
strongly
the
liquid
words
of
her
own
tongue
repeated
in
english
as
if
what
she
strove
to
call
she
would
share
with
her
companions
now
there
was
triumph
in
her
singing
and
ross
found
himself
echoing
her
walk
this
road
as
a
demand
it
was
still
there
all
of
it
the
crushing
weight
of
the
past
and
that
which
brooded
within
that
past
which
had
reached
out
for
them
to
possess
or
to
alter
only
they
were
free
of
that
reaching
now
and
they
could
see
too
the
fuzzy
darkness
was
lighter
and
there
were
normal
walls
about
them
ross
put
out
his
free
hand
and
rubbed
finger
tips
along
rough
stone
once
more
their
senses
were
assaulted
by
a
stealthy
attack
from
beyond
the
bounds
of
space
and
time
as
the
walls
fell
away
and
they
came
out
into
a
wide
space
whose
boundaries
they
could
not
see
here
that
which
brooded
was
strong
a
mighty
weight
poised
aloft
to
strike
them
down
come
down
awake
stir
karara
pleading
sank
again
to
a
whisper
her
voice
sounded
hoarse
as
if
her
mouth
were
dry
her
words
formed
by
a
shrunken
tongue
issued
from
a
parched
throat
light
spreading
in
channels
along
the
floor
making
a
fiery
pattern
patterns
within
patterns
intricate
designs
within
designs
ross
jerked
his
eyes
away
from
those
patterns
to
study
them
was
danger
he
knew
without
being
warned
karara
nails
bit
into
his
flesh
and
he
welcomed
that
pain
it
kept
him
alert
conscious
of
what
was
ross
murdock
holding
him
safely
apart
from
something
greater
than
he
but
entirely
alien
the
designs
and
patterns
were
lines
on
a
pavement
and
now
the
three
foanna
swaying
as
if
yielding
to
unseen
winds
began
to
follow
those
patterns
with
small
dancing
steps
but
the
terrans
remained
where
they
were
holding
to
one
another
for
the
sustaining
strength
their
contact
offered
back
forth
the
foanna
danced
and
once
more
their
cloaks
vanished
or
were
discarded
so
their
figures
advanced
retreated
weaving
a
way
from
one
arabesque
to
another
first
about
the
outer
rim
and
then
in
by
spirals
and
circles
no
light
except
the
crimson
glowing
rivulets
on
the
floor
the
silver
bodies
of
the
foanna
moving
back
and
forth
in
and
out
then
suddenly
the
three
dancers
halted
huddled
together
in
an
open
space
between
the
designs
and
ross
was
startled
by
the
impression
of
confusion
doubt
almost
despair
wafted
from
them
to
the
terrans
back
across
the
patterned
floor
they
came
their
hands
clasped
even
as
the
terrans
stood
together
and
now
they
fronted
the
three
out
of
time
too
few
we
are
too
few
she
who
was
the
mid
one
of
the
trio
said
we
can
not
open
the
great
door
how
many
do
you
need
karara
voice
was
no
longer
parched
frightened
she
might
have
traveled
through
fear
to
a
new
serenity
why
did
he
think
that
ross
wondered
fleetingly
was
it
because
he
too
had
had
the
same
release
the
polynesian
girl
loosed
her
grip
on
her
companions
hands
taking
a
step
closer
to
the
foanna
three
can
be
four
or
five
ashe
moved
up
beside
her
if
we
suit
your
purpose
was
gordon
ashe
crazy
or
had
he
fallen
victim
to
whatever
filled
this
place
yet
it
was
ashe
voice
sane
serene
as
ross
had
always
heard
it
the
younger
agent
wet
his
lips
it
was
his
turn
to
have
a
dry
mouth
this
was
not
his
game
it
could
not
be
yet
he
summoned
voice
enough
to
add
in
turn
six
when
it
came
the
foanna
answer
was
a
warning
to
aid
us
you
must
cast
aside
your
shields
allow
your
identities
to
become
one
with
our
forces
having
done
so
it
may
be
that
you
shall
never
be
as
you
are
now
but
changed
changed
the
word
echoed
perhaps
not
in
the
place
where
they
stood
but
in
ross
head
this
was
a
risk
such
as
he
had
never
taken
before
his
chances
in
the
past
had
been
matters
of
action
where
his
own
strength
and
wits
were
matched
against
the
problem
here
he
would
open
a
door
to
forces
he
and
his
kind
should
not
meet
expose
himself
to
danger
such
as
did
not
exist
on
the
plane
where
weapons
and
strength
of
arm
could
decide
victory
or
defeat
and
this
was
not
really
his
fight
at
all
what
did
it
matter
to
terrans
ten
thousand
years
or
so
in
the
future
what
happened
to
hawaikans
in
this
past
he
was
a
fool
they
were
all
fools
to
become
embroiled
in
this
the
baldies
and
their
stellar
empire
if
that
ever
had
existed
as
the
terrans
surmised
was
long
gone
before
his
breed
entered
space
if
you
accomplish
this
with
our
aid
said
ashe
will
you
be
able
to
defeat
the
invaders
again
a
lengthening
moment
of
silence
before
the
foanna
replied
we
can
not
tell
we
only
know
that
there
is
a
force
laid
up
here
set
behind
certain
gates
in
the
far
past
upon
which
we
may
call
for
some
supreme
effort
but
this
much
we
also
know
the
evil
of
the
shadow
reaches
out
from
here
now
and
where
that
darkness
falls
men
will
no
longer
be
men
but
things
in
the
guise
of
men
who
obey
and
follow
as
mindless
creatures
as
yet
this
shadow
of
the
shadow
is
a
small
one
but
it
will
spread
for
that
is
the
nature
of
those
who
have
spawned
it
they
have
chanced
upon
and
corrupted
a
thing
we
know
such
power
feeds
upon
the
will
to
power
having
turned
it
to
their
bidding
they
will
not
be
able
to
resist
using
it
for
it
is
so
easy
to
do
and
the
results
exult
the
nature
of
those
who
employ
it
you
have
said
that
you
and
those
like
you
who
travel
the
time
trails
fear
to
change
the
past
here
the
first
steps
have
been
taken
to
alter
the
future
but
unless
we
complete
the
defense
it
will
be
ill
for
all
of
us
and
this
is
your
only
weapon
ashe
asked
once
more
the
only
one
strong
enough
to
stand
against
that
which
is
now
unleashed
in
the
pavement
the
fiery
lines
were
bright
and
glowing
even
when
ross
shut
his
eyes
parts
of
those
designs
were
still
visible
against
his
eyelids
we
do
know
how
he
made
a
last
feeble
protest
on
the
side
of
prudence
we
could
move
as
you
did
apart
no
together
yes
the
silvery
figures
were
once
more
swaying
the
mist
which
was
their
hair
flowing
about
them
karara
hands
went
out
and
the
slender
fingers
of
one
of
the
foanna
lifted
closed
about
firm
brown
terran
flesh
ashe
was
doing
the
same
ross
thought
he
cried
out
but
he
could
not
be
sure
as
he
watched
karara
head
begin
to
sway
in
concert
with
her
foanna
partner
her
black
hair
springing
out
from
her
shoulders
to
rival
the
rippling
strands
of
the
alien
ashe
was
consciously
matching
steps
with
the
companion
who
also
drew
him
along
a
flowing
line
of
fire
in
this
last
instant
ross
realized
the
time
for
retreat
was
past
there
was
no
place
left
to
go
his
hands
went
out
though
he
had
to
force
that
invitation
because
in
him
there
was
a
shrinking
horror
of
this
surrender
but
he
could
not
let
the
others
go
without
him
the
foanna
touch
was
cool
and
yet
it
seemed
that
flesh
met
his
flesh
fingers
as
normal
as
his
met
fingers
in
that
grasp
and
when
that
hold
was
complete
he
gave
a
small
gasp
for
his
horror
was
wiped
away
he
knew
in
its
place
a
burst
of
energy
which
could
be
disciplined
to
use
as
a
weapon
or
a
tool
in
concentrated
and
complicated
action
his
feet
so
and
then
so
did
those
directions
flow
without
words
from
the
foanna
fingers
to
his
and
then
along
his
nerves
to
his
brain
he
only
knew
which
was
the
proper
next
step
and
the
next
and
the
next
as
they
wove
their
way
along
the
pattern
lines
with
their
going
adding
a
necessary
thread
to
a
design
forward
four
steps
backward
one
in
and
out
did
ross
actually
hear
that
sweet
thrumming
akin
to
the
lilting
speech
of
the
foanna
or
was
it
a
throbbing
in
his
blood
in
and
out
what
had
become
of
the
others
he
did
not
know
he
was
aware
only
of
his
own
path
of
the
hand
in
his
of
the
silvery
shape
at
his
side
to
whom
he
was
now
tied
as
if
one
of
the
rover
capture
nets
enclosed
them
both
the
fiery
lines
under
his
feet
were
smoking
tendrils
rising
and
twisting
as
the
hair
of
the
foanna
rippled
and
twisted
and
the
smoke
clung
wreathed
his
body
they
moved
in
a
cocoon
of
smoke
thicker
and
thicker
until
ross
could
not
even
see
the
foanna
who
accompanied
him
was
only
assured
of
her
presence
by
the
hand
which
grasped
his
and
a
small
part
of
him
clung
desperately
to
the
awareness
of
that
clasp
as
an
anchorage
against
what
might
come
a
tie
between
the
world
of
reality
and
the
place
into
which
he
was
passing
how
did
one
find
words
to
describe
this
ross
wondered
with
that
part
of
him
which
remained
stubbornly
ross
murdock
terran
time
agent
he
thought
that
he
did
not
see
with
his
eyes
hear
with
his
ears
but
used
other
senses
his
own
kind
did
not
recognize
nor
acknowledge
space
not
a
room
a
made
by
normal
nature
space
which
held
something
pure
energy
his
terran
mind
strove
to
give
name
to
that
which
was
nameless
perhaps
it
was
that
spark
of
memory
and
consciousness
which
gave
him
that
instant
of
seeing
was
it
a
throne
and
on
it
a
shimmering
figure
he
was
regarded
intently
measured
and
set
aside
there
were
questions
or
a
question
he
could
not
hear
and
perhaps
an
answer
he
would
never
be
able
to
understand
or
had
any
of
this
happened
at
all
ross
crouched
on
a
cold
floor
his
head
hanging
drained
of
energy
of
all
that
feeling
of
power
and
he
had
had
when
they
had
begun
their
dance
across
the
symbols
about
him
those
designs
still
glowed
dully
when
he
looked
at
them
too
intently
his
head
ached
he
could
almost
understand
but
the
struggle
was
so
exhausting
he
winced
at
the
effort
gordon
there
was
no
clasp
on
his
hand
he
was
alone
alone
between
two
glowing
arabesques
that
loneliness
struck
at
him
with
the
sharpness
of
a
blow
his
head
came
up
frantically
he
stared
about
him
in
search
of
his
companions
gordon
his
plea
and
demand
in
one
was
answered
ross
on
his
hands
and
knees
ross
used
the
rags
of
his
strength
to
crawl
in
that
direction
stopping
now
and
then
to
shade
his
eyes
with
his
hands
to
peer
through
the
cracks
between
his
fingers
for
some
sight
of
ashe
there
he
was
sitting
quietly
his
head
up
as
if
he
were
listening
or
striving
to
listen
his
cheeks
were
sunken
he
had
the
drained
worn
look
of
a
man
strained
to
the
limit
of
physical
energy
yet
there
was
a
quiet
peace
in
his
face
ross
crawled
on
put
out
a
hand
to
ashe
arm
as
if
only
by
touching
the
other
could
he
be
sure
he
was
not
an
illusion
and
ashe
fingers
came
up
to
cover
the
younger
man
in
a
grasp
as
tight
as
the
foanna
hold
had
been
we
did
it
together
we
did
it
ashe
said
but
where
why
those
questions
were
not
aimed
at
him
ross
knew
and
at
that
moment
the
younger
man
did
not
care
where
they
had
been
what
they
had
done
it
was
enough
that
his
terrible
loneliness
was
gone
that
ashe
was
here
still
keeping
his
hold
on
ross
ashe
turned
his
head
and
called
into
the
wilderness
of
the
space
about
them
karara
she
came
to
them
not
crawling
not
wrung
almost
dry
of
spirit
and
strength
but
on
her
two
feet
about
her
shoulders
her
dark
hair
waved
and
spun
or
was
it
dark
now
along
those
strands
there
seemed
to
be
threaded
motes
of
light
giving
a
silvery
sheen
which
was
a
faint
echo
of
the
foanna
tresses
and
was
it
only
his
bemused
and
bewildered
sight
ross
mused
or
was
her
skin
fairer
karara
smiled
down
at
them
and
held
out
her
hands
offering
one
to
each
when
they
took
them
ross
knew
again
that
surge
of
energy
he
had
felt
when
he
had
followed
the
foanna
into
the
maze
dance
come
there
is
much
to
do
he
could
not
be
mistaken
her
voice
held
the
singing
lilt
of
the
foanna
somehow
she
had
crossed
some
barrier
to
become
a
paler
perhaps
a
lesser
but
still
a
copy
of
the
three
aliens
was
this
what
they
had
meant
when
they
warned
of
a
change
which
might
come
to
those
who
followed
them
into
the
ritual
of
this
place
ross
looked
from
the
girl
to
ashe
with
searching
intensity
no
he
could
see
no
outward
change
in
gordon
and
he
felt
none
within
himself
come
some
of
karara
old
impetuousness
returned
as
she
tugged
at
them
urging
them
to
their
feet
and
drawing
them
with
her
she
appeared
to
know
where
they
must
go
and
both
men
followed
her
guidance
once
more
they
came
out
of
the
weird
and
alien
into
the
normal
for
here
were
the
rock
walls
of
a
passage
running
up
at
an
angle
which
became
so
steep
they
were
forced
to
pull
along
by
handholds
hollowed
in
the
walls
where
are
we
going
ashe
asked
to
cleanse
karara
answer
was
ambiguous
and
she
sped
along
hardly
touching
the
handholds
but
hurry
they
finished
their
climb
and
were
in
another
corridor
where
patches
of
sunlight
came
through
a
pierced
wall
to
dazzle
their
eyes
this
was
similar
to
the
way
which
had
run
beside
the
courtyard
in
zahur
castle
ross
looked
out
of
the
first
opening
down
into
a
courtyard
but
where
zahur
had
held
the
busy
life
of
a
castle
this
was
silent
silent
but
not
deserted
there
were
men
below
armed
helmed
he
recognized
the
uniform
of
the
wrecker
warriors
saw
one
or
two
who
wore
the
gray
of
the
foanna
servants
they
stood
in
lines
unmoving
without
speech
among
themselves
men
who
might
have
been
frozen
into
immobility
and
arranged
so
for
some
game
in
which
they
were
the
voiceless
pieces
and
their
immobility
was
a
thing
to
arouse
fear
were
they
dead
and
still
standing
come
karara
voice
had
sunk
to
a
whisper
and
her
hand
pulled
at
the
men
what
began
ross
ashe
shook
his
head
those
rows
below
drawn
up
as
if
in
order
to
march
unliving
rows
they
could
not
be
alive
as
the
terrans
knew
life
ross
left
his
vantage
point
ready
to
follow
karara
but
he
could
not
blot
from
his
mind
the
picture
of
those
lines
nor
forget
the
terrible
blankness
which
made
their
faces
more
unhuman
more
frightenly
alien
than
those
of
the
foanna
shades
against
shadow
the
corridor
ended
in
a
narrow
slit
of
room
and
the
wall
before
them
was
not
the
worked
stone
of
the
citadel
but
a
single
slab
of
what
appeared
to
be
glass
curdled
into
creamy
ridges
and
depressions
here
were
the
foanna
their
robes
once
more
cloaking
them
each
held
point
out
one
of
the
rods
they
moved
slowly
but
with
the
precise
gestures
of
those
about
a
demanding
and
very
important
task
as
they
traced
each
depression
in
the
wall
before
them
with
the
wand
points
down
up
around
as
their
feet
had
moved
in
the
dance
pattern
so
now
their
wands
moved
to
cover
each
line
now
the
wands
dropped
points
to
the
floor
the
foanna
moved
equidistant
from
one
another
then
as
one
the
rods
were
lifted
vertically
brought
down
together
with
a
single
loud
tap
on
the
wall
the
blue
lines
they
had
traced
with
such
care
darkened
melted
the
glassy
slab
shivered
shattered
fell
outward
in
a
lace
of
fragments
so
the
narrow
room
became
a
balcony
above
a
large
chamber
below
a
platform
ran
the
full
length
of
that
hall
and
on
it
were
mounted
a
line
of
oval
disks
these
had
been
turned
to
different
angles
and
each
reflected
light
a
ray
beam
directed
at
them
from
a
machine
whose
metallic
casing
projecting
antennae
was
oddly
out
of
place
here
once
more
the
three
staffs
of
the
foanna
raised
as
one
in
the
air
this
time
from
the
knobs
held
out
over
the
hall
blazed
not
the
usual
whirl
of
small
sparks
but
strong
beams
of
light
blue
light
darkening
as
it
pierced
downward
until
it
became
thrusting
lines
of
almost
tangible
substance
when
those
blue
beams
struck
the
nearest
ovals
they
webbed
with
lines
which
cracked
wide
open
shattered
bits
tinkled
down
to
the
platform
there
was
a
stir
at
the
end
of
the
hall
where
the
machine
stood
figures
ran
into
plain
sight
baldies
ross
cried
out
a
warning
as
he
saw
those
star
men
raise
weapon
tubes
aimed
at
the
perch
on
which
the
foanna
stood
fire
crackling
with
the
speed
and
sound
of
lightning
lashed
up
at
the
balcony
the
lances
of
light
met
the
spears
of
dark
and
there
was
a
flash
which
blinded
ross
a
sound
which
split
open
the
whole
world
the
terran
eyes
opened
not
upon
darkness
but
on
dazzling
light
flashes
of
it
which
tore
over
him
in
great
sweeping
arcs
dazed
sick
he
tried
to
press
his
prone
body
into
the
unyielding
surface
on
which
he
lay
but
there
was
no
way
of
burrowing
out
of
this
wild
storm
of
light
and
clashing
sound
now
under
him
the
very
fabric
of
the
floor
rocked
and
quivered
as
if
it
were
being
shaken
apart
into
crumbling
rubble
all
the
will
and
ability
to
move
was
gone
ross
could
only
lie
there
and
endure
what
had
happened
he
did
not
know
save
that
what
raged
about
him
now
was
a
warring
of
inimical
forces
perhaps
both
feeding
on
each
other
even
as
they
strove
for
mastery
the
play
of
rays
resembled
sword
blades
crossing
fencing
ross
threw
his
arm
over
his
eyes
to
shut
out
the
intolerable
brilliance
of
that
thrust
and
counter
his
body
tingled
and
winced
as
the
whirlwind
of
energy
clashed
and
reclashed
he
was
beaten
stupid
as
a
man
pinned
down
too
long
under
a
heavy
shelling
how
did
it
end
in
one
terrific
thunderclap
of
sound
and
blasting
power
and
when
did
it
end
hours
days
later
time
was
a
thing
set
apart
from
this
ross
lay
in
the
quiet
which
his
body
welcomed
thirstily
then
he
was
conscious
of
the
touch
of
wind
on
his
face
wind
carrying
the
hint
of
sea
salt
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
above
him
a
patch
of
clouded
sky
shakily
he
levered
himself
up
on
his
elbows
there
were
no
complete
walls
any
more
just
jagged
points
of
masonry
broken
teeth
set
in
a
skull
jawbone
open
sky
dark
clouds
spattering
rain
gordon
karara
ross
voice
was
a
thin
whisper
he
licked
his
lips
and
tried
again
gordon
had
there
been
an
answering
whimper
ross
crawled
into
a
hollow
between
two
fallen
blocks
a
pool
of
water
no
it
was
the
cloak
of
one
of
the
foanna
spread
out
across
the
flooring
in
this
fragment
of
room
then
ross
saw
that
ashe
was
there
the
cloaked
figure
braced
against
the
terran
shoulder
as
he
half
supported
half
embraced
the
foanna
ynvalda
ashe
called
that
with
an
urgency
which
was
demanding
now
the
foanna
moved
raising
an
arm
in
the
cloak
flowing
sleeve
ross
sat
back
on
his
heels
ross
ashe
he
turned
his
head
karara
stood
here
then
came
forward
planting
her
feet
with
care
her
hands
outstretched
her
eyes
wide
and
unseeing
ross
pulled
himself
up
and
went
to
her
finding
that
the
once
solid
floor
seemed
to
dip
and
sway
under
him
until
he
too
must
balance
and
creep
his
hands
closed
on
her
shoulders
and
he
pulled
her
to
him
in
mutual
support
gordon
over
there
you
all
right
i
think
so
her
voice
was
weak
the
foanna
ynlan
ynvalda
steadying
herself
against
him
she
tried
to
look
around
the
place
which
had
once
been
a
narrow
room
then
a
balcony
was
now
a
perch
above
space
the
hall
of
the
oval
mirrors
was
gone
having
disappeared
into
a
hollow
the
depths
of
which
were
veiled
by
a
vapor
which
boiled
and
bubbled
as
if
far
below
some
huge
caldron
hung
above
a
blazing
fire
karara
cried
out
and
ross
drew
her
back
from
that
drop
he
was
now
and
looked
about
for
some
way
down
from
this
doubtful
perch
of
the
other
two
foanna
there
was
no
sign
had
they
been
sucked
up
and
out
in
the
inferno
they
had
created
with
their
unleashing
of
energy
against
the
baldies
installation
ross
look
karara
cry
her
upflung
arm
directed
his
attention
aloft
under
the
sullen
gathering
of
the
storm
a
sphere
arose
as
a
bubble
might
seek
the
surface
of
a
pool
before
breaking
a
ship
a
baldy
ship
taking
off
from
the
ruined
citadel
so
some
of
the
enemy
had
survived
that
trial
of
strength
the
globe
was
small
a
scout
used
for
exploration
ross
judged
it
arose
first
and
then
moved
inland
fleeing
the
gathering
storm
to
be
out
of
sight
in
moments
inland
where
the
mountain
base
of
the
invaders
was
reputed
to
be
retreating
or
bound
to
gather
reinforcements
baldies
karara
asked
yes
she
wiped
her
hand
across
her
face
smearing
dust
and
grime
on
her
cheeks
as
raindrops
pattered
about
them
ross
drew
the
girl
with
him
into
the
alcove
where
ashe
sheltered
with
the
foanna
the
cowled
alien
was
sitting
up
her
hand
still
gripping
one
of
the
wands
now
a
ruin
ashe
glanced
at
them
as
if
for
the
first
time
he
remembered
they
might
be
there
baldy
ship
just
took
off
inland
ross
told
him
we
did
see
either
of
the
other
foanna
they
have
gone
to
do
what
is
to
be
done
ashe
companion
replied
so
some
of
the
enemy
fled
well
perhaps
they
have
learned
one
lesson
not
to
meddle
with
others
devices
ahh
so
much
gone
which
will
never
come
again
never
again
she
held
up
the
wand
turning
it
back
and
forth
before
her
before
she
cast
it
away
it
flew
out
up
then
dropped
into
the
caldron
of
the
hall
which
had
been
a
gust
of
rain
cold
chilling
the
lightly
clad
terrans
swept
across
them
the
foanna
was
helped
to
her
feet
by
ashe
for
a
moment
she
turned
slowly
giving
a
lingering
look
to
the
ruins
then
she
spoke
broken
stone
holds
no
value
take
hands
my
brothers
my
sister
it
is
time
we
go
hence

in
ross
right
ashe
in
his
left
and
both
linked
to
ynvalda
in
turn
then
they
were
indeed
elsewhere
in
a
courtyard
where
bodies
lay
flaccid
under
the
drenching
downpour
of
the
rain
and
moving
among
those
bodies
were
the
two
other
foanna
bending
to
examine
one
man
after
another
perhaps
over
one
in
three
they
so
inspected
they
held
consultation
before
a
wand
was
used
in
tracing
certain
portions
of
the
body
between
them
when
they
were
finished
that
man
stirred
moaned
showed
signs
of
life
once
more
rosss
from
behind
a
tumbled
wall
crept
a
hawaikan
who
did
not
wear
the
guard
armor
of
the
others
flippers
diver
belt
had
been
stripped
from
him
there
was
a
bleeding
gash
down
the
side
of
his
face
and
he
held
his
left
arm
against
his
body
supported
by
his
right
hand
baleku
the
rover
pulled
himself
up
to
his
feet
and
stood
swaying
ross
reached
him
quickly
to
catch
him
as
he
slumped
forward
loketh
the
terran
asked
the
took
him
somehow
the
rover
got
that
out
as
ross
half
supported
half
led
him
to
where
the
foanna
were
gathering
those
they
had
been
able
to
revive
they
wanted
to
learn
baleku
was
obviously
making
a
great
effort
to
tell
his
story
about
about
where
we
came
from
where
we
got
the
packs
so
now
they
will
know
of
us
or
will
if
they
get
the
story
out
of
loketh
ashe
worked
with
ross
to
splint
the
rover
broken
arm
how
many
of
them
were
here
baleku
the
rover
head
moved
slowly
from
side
to
side
i
do
not
know
in
truth
it
is
was
like
a
dream
i
was
in
the
water
swimming
through
the
sea
gate
then
suddenly
i
was
in
another
place
where
those
from
the
stars
waited
about
me
they
had
our
packs
and
belts
and
these
they
showed
us
demanding
to
know
whereof
these
were
loketh
was
like
one
deep
in
sleep
and
they
left
him
so
when
they
questioned
me
then
there
came
a
great
noise
and
the
floor
under
us
shook
lightning
flashed
through
the
air
two
of
the
ran
from
the
room
and
all
of
them
were
greatly
excited
they
took
up
loketh
and
carried
him
away
with
him
the
packs
and
other
things
and
i
was
left
alone
though
i
could
not
move
as
if
they
had
left
me
in
a
net
i
could
not
see
more
and
more
were
the
flashes
then
one
of
those
slayers
of
women
stood
in
the
doorway
he
raised
his
hand
and
my
feet
were
free
but
i
could
not
move
otherwise
than
to
follow
after
him
we
came
along
a
hall
and
into
this
court
where
men
stood
unstirring
although
stones
fell
from
the
walls
upon
some
of
them
and
the
ground
shook
baleku
voice
grew
shriller
his
words
ran
together
the
one
who
pulled
me
after
him
by
his
will
he
cried
out
and
put
his
hands
to
his
head
back
and
forth
he
ran
bumping
into
the
standing
men
and
once
running
into
a
wall
as
if
he
were
blinded
and
then
he
was
gone
and
i
was
alone
there
was
more
falling
stone
and
one
struck
my
shoulder
so
i
was
thrown
to
the
ground
there
i
lay
until
you
came
so
few
out
of
many
so
few
one
of
the
foanna
stood
beside
them
her
cloak
streaming
with
the
falling
rain
and
for
these
she
faced
the
lines
of
those
they
had
not
revived
there
was
no
chance
they
died
as
helplessly
as
if
they
went
into
a
meeting
of
swords
with
their
arms
bound
to
their
sides
evil
have
we
wrought
here
ashe
shook
his
head
evil
has
been
wrought
here
ynlan
but
not
by
your
seeking
and
those
who
died
here
helplessly
may
be
only
a
small
portion
of
those
yet
to
be
sacrificed
have
you
forgotten
the
slaughter
at
kyn
add
and
those
other
fairings
where
women
and
children
were
also
struck
down
to
serve
some
purpose
we
do
not
even
yet
know
lady
great
one
baleku
struggled
to
sit
up
and
ross
slipped
an
arm
behind
him
in
aid
she
for
whom
i
made
a
was
meat
for
them
at
kyn
add
along
with
many
others
if
these
slayers
are
not
put
to
the
sword
edge
there
will
be
other
fairings
so
used
and
these
shadow
ones
possess
a
magic
to
draw
men
to
them
helplessly
to
be
killed
great
one
you
have
powers
all
men
know
that
wind
and
wave
obey
your
call
do
you
now
use
your
magic
it
is
better
to
fall
with
a
power
we
know
than
answer
such
spells
as
those
killers
have
netted
about
the
men
here
this
is
one
weapon
which
they
shall
not
use
again
ynvalda
rose
from
a
stone
block
where
she
had
been
sitting
and
perhaps
in
its
way
it
was
one
of
the
most
dangerous
but
in
defeating
it
we
have
by
so
much
weakened
ourselves
also
and
the
strong
place
of
these
star
men
lies
not
on
the
coast
but
inland
they
will
be
warned
by
those
who
fled
this
place
wind
and
wave
yes
those
have
served
our
purpose
in
the
past
but
now
perhaps
we
have
found
that
which
our
power
will
not
best
only
for
this
her
gesture
was
for
the
ruins
of
the
citadel
and
the
dead
there
shall
be
a
payment
exacted
to
the
height
of
our
desire
whether
the
foanna
did
have
any
control
over
the
storm
winds
or
not
the
present
deluge
appeared
not
to
accommodate
them
the
dazed
injured
survivors
of
the
courtyard
were
brought
to
shelter
in
some
of
the
underground
passages
there
appeared
to
be
no
other
reminders
of
the
wrecker
force
which
had
earlier
besieged
the
keep
than
those
survivors
but
within
hours
some
of
those
who
had
served
the
foanna
for
generations
returned
and
the
foanna
themselves
opened
the
sea
gates
so
that
the
rover
cruisers
anchored
in
the
small
bay
below
their
ruined
walls
a
small
force
and
one
to
go
up
against
the
baldies
some
five
star
men
bodies
had
been
found
in
the
citadel
but
the
ship
had
gone
off
to
warn
their
base
to
ross
thinking
the
advantage
still
lay
with
the
invaders
but
the
hawaikans
refused
to
accept
the
idea
that
the
odds
were
against
them
as
soon
as
the
storm
blew
out
its
force
ongal
cruiser
headed
northwest
to
other
clan
fairings
where
the
rovers
could
claim
kinship
and
afrukta
sailed
on
the
same
errand
south
while
some
of
the
wreckers
were
released
to
carry
the
warning
to
their
lords
just
how
great
a
force
could
be
gathered
through
such
means
and
how
effective
it
would
be
was
a
question
to
make
the
terrans
uneasy
karara
disappeared
with
the
foanna
into
the
surviving
inner
below
the
citadel
but
ashe
and
ross
remained
with
torgul
and
his
officers
striving
to
bring
organization
out
of
the
chaos
about
them
we
must
know
just
where
their
lair
lies
torgul
stated
the
obvious
the
mountains
you
believe
and
they
can
fly
in
sky
ships
to
and
from
that
point
well
he
spread
out
a
chart
here
are
the
mountains
on
this
island
running
so
an
army
marching
hither
could
be
sighted
from
sky
ships
also
there
are
many
mountains
which
is
the
one
or
ones
we
must
seek
it
may
take
many
tens
of
days
to
find
that
place
while
they
will
always
know
where
we
are
watch
us
from
above
prepare
for
our
coming
again
ross
mentally
paid
tribute
to
the
captain
quick
grasp
of
essentials
you
have
a
solution
captain
ashe
asked
there
is
the
river
here
torgul
said
reflectively
perhaps
i
think
in
terms
of
water
because
i
am
a
sailor
but
here
it
does
run
and
for
this
far
along
it
our
cruisers
may
ascend
he
pointed
with
his
finger
tip
this
lies
however
in
glicmas
land
and
he
is
now
the
mightiest
of
the
wrecker
lords
his
sword
always
drawn
against
us
i
do
not
believe
that
we
could
talk
him
into
glicmas
ross
interrupted
they
both
looked
at
him
inquiringly
and
he
repeated
loketh
story
of
the
wrecker
lord
who
had
had
dealings
with
a
voice
from
the
mountain
and
so
gained
the
wrecking
devices
to
make
him
the
dominant
lord
of
the
district
so
torgul
exclaimed
that
is
the
evil
of
this
shadow
in
the
mountains
no
under
those
circumstances
i
do
not
think
we
shall
talk
glicmas
into
furthering
any
raid
against
those
who
have
made
him
great
over
his
fellows
rather
will
he
turn
against
us
in
their
cause
and
if
we
do
not
use
the
cruisers
up
the
river
ashe
conned
the
map
then
perhaps
a
small
party
or
parties
working
overland
could
strike
the
stream
here
nearer
to
the
uplands
torgul
frowned
at
the
map
i
do
not
think
so
even
small
parties
moving
in
that
direction
would
be
sighted
by
glicmas
people
the
more
so
if
they
headed
inland
he
will
not
wish
to
share
his
secrets
with
others
but
say
a
party
of
foanna
the
captain
glanced
up
swiftly
to
favor
ashe
with
a
keen
regard
then
he
would
not
dare
no
i
am
sure
he
would
not
dare
to
interfere
not
yet
has
he
risen
high
enough
to
turn
the
hook
of
his
sword
against
them
but
would
the
foanna
do
so
if
not
the
foanna
then
others
wearing
like
robes
ashe
said
slowly
others
wearing
like
robes
repeated
torgul
now
his
frown
was
heavy
no
man
would
take
on
the
guise
of
the
foanna
he
would
be
blasted
by
their
power
for
so
doing
if
the
foanna
will
lead
us
in
their
persons
then
we
shall
follow
gladly
knowing
that
their
magic
will
be
with
us
there
is
also
this
ross
broke
in
the
baldies
have
the
they
took
from
baleku
and
loketh
and
they
have
loketh
they
will
want
to
learn
more
about
us
we
hoped
that
the
citadel
would
provide
bait
to
draw
them
and
it
did
that
our
plan
for
a
trap
there
was
spoiled
was
ill
fortune
but
i
am
sure
that
if
the
baldies
believe
we
are
coming
to
them
they
will
hold
off
an
attack
against
our
march
hoping
to
gather
us
in
intact
they
risk
that
ashe
nodded
i
agree
we
are
the
unknown
they
must
solve
now
and
this
much
i
am
sure
of
the
future
of
this
world
and
her
people
balances
on
a
very
narrow
line
of
choice
it
is
my
hope
that
such
a
choice
is
still
to
be
made
torgul
smiled
thinly
we
live
in
perilous
times
when
the
shades
require
our
swords
to
go
up
against
the
shadow
world
in
doubt
the
day
was
dully
overcast
as
all
days
had
been
since
they
had
begun
this
penetration
into
the
mountain
territory
ross
could
not
accept
the
idea
that
the
foanna
might
actually
command
wind
and
wave
storm
and
sun
as
the
hawaikans
firmly
believed
but
the
gloomy
weather
favored
them
so
far
and
now
they
had
reached
the
last
breathing
point
before
they
took
the
plunge
into
the
heart
of
the
enemy
country
about
the
way
in
which
they
were
to
make
that
plunge
ross
had
his
own
plan
one
he
did
not
intend
to
share
with
either
ashe
or
karara
though
he
had
had
to
outline
it
to
the
one
now
waiting
here
with
him
this
is
still
your
mind
younger
brother
he
did
not
turn
his
head
to
look
at
the
cloaked
figure
it
is
still
my
mind
ross
could
be
firm
on
that
point
the
terran
backed
out
of
the
vantage
place
from
which
he
had
been
studying
the
canyonlike
valley
cupping
the
baldy
spaceship
now
he
got
to
his
feet
and
faced
ynlan
his
own
gray
cloak
billowing
out
in
the
wind
to
reveal
the
rover
scale
armor
underneath
you
can
do
it
for
me
he
asked
in
turn
during
the
past
days
the
foanna
had
admitted
that
the
weird
battle
within
the
citadel
had
weakened
and
limited
their
magic
last
night
they
had
detected
a
force
barrier
ahead
and
to
transport
the
whole
party
through
that
by
telaporting
was
impossible
yes
you
alone
then
my
wand
would
be
drained
for
a
space
but
what
can
you
do
within
their
hold
save
be
meat
for
their
taking
there
can
not
be
too
many
of
them
left
there
that
a
small
ship
they
lost
five
at
the
citadel
and
the
rovers
have
three
prisoners
no
sign
of
the
scout
ship
we
know
they
have
so
more
of
them
must
be
gone
in
it
i
wo
be
facing
an
army
and
what
they
have
in
the
way
of
weapons
may
be
powered
by
installations
in
the
ship
a
lot
of
damage
done
there
or
even
if
the
ship
lifted
he
was
not
sure
of
what
he
could
do
this
was
a
venture
depending
largely
on
improvisation
at
the
last
moment
you
propose
to
send
off
the
ship
i
do
know
whether
that
is
possible
no
perhaps
i
can
only
attract
their
attention
break
through
the
force
shield
so
the
rest
may
attack
ross
knew
that
he
must
attempt
this
independent
action
that
in
order
to
remain
the
ross
murdock
he
had
always
been
he
must
be
an
actor
not
a
spectator
the
foanna
did
not
argue
with
him
now
where
her
long
sleeve
rippled
as
she
gestured
to
the
canyon
dull
as
the
skies
were
overhead
there
was
light
here
too
much
of
it
for
his
purpose
as
the
ground
about
the
ship
was
open
to
appear
there
might
be
fatal
ross
was
grasped
by
another
and
much
more
promising
idea
the
foanna
had
transported
them
all
to
the
deck
of
torgul
cruiser
after
asking
him
to
picture
it
for
her
mentally
and
to
all
outward
appearances
the
baldy
ship
before
them
now
was
twin
to
the
one
which
had
taken
him
once
on
a
fantastic
voyage
across
a
stellar
empire
such
a
ship
he
knew
can
you
put
me
in
the
ship
if
you
have
a
good
memory
of
it
yes
but
how
know
you
these
ships
i
was
in
one
once
for
many
days
if
these
are
alike
then
i
know
it
well
and
if
this
is
unlike
to
try
such
may
mean
your
death
he
had
to
accept
her
warning
yet
outwardly
this
ship
was
a
duplicate
and
before
he
had
voyaged
on
the
derelict
he
had
also
explored
a
wrecker
freighter
on
his
own
world
thousands
of
years
before
his
own
race
had
evolved
there
was
one
portion
of
both
ships
which
had
been
identical
save
for
size
and
that
part
was
the
best
for
his
purpose
send
me
here
with
closed
eyes
ross
produced
a
mental
picture
of
the
control
cabin
those
seats
which
were
not
really
seats
but
webbing
support
swinging
before
banks
of
buttons
and
levers
all
the
other
installations
he
had
watched
studied
until
they
were
as
known
to
him
as
the
plate
bulkheads
of
the
cabin
below
in
which
he
had
slept
very
vivid
that
memory
he
felt
the
touch
of
the
foanna
cool
fingers
on
his
forehead
then
it
was
gone
he
opened
his
eyes
no
more
wind
and
gloom
he
stood
directly
behind
the
pilot
facing
a
and
rows
of
controls
just
as
he
had
stood
so
many
times
in
the
derelict
he
had
made
it
this
was
the
control
cabin
of
the
spacer
and
it
was
alive
the
faint
thrumming
in
the
air
the
play
of
lights
on
the
boards
ross
pulled
the
cowl
of
his
foanna
cloak
up
over
his
head
he
had
had
days
to
accustom
himself
to
the
bulk
of
the
robe
but
still
its
swathings
were
sometimes
a
hindrance
rather
than
a
help
slowly
he
turned
there
were
no
baldies
here
but
the
well
door
to
the
lower
levels
was
open
and
from
it
came
small
sounds
echoing
up
the
communication
ladder
the
ship
was
occupied
not
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
started
on
this
venture
ross
wished
for
more
complete
information
doubtless
several
of
those
buttons
or
levers
before
him
controlled
devices
which
could
be
the
greatest
aid
to
him
now
but
which
and
how
he
did
not
know
once
in
just
such
a
cabin
he
had
meddled
and
in
activating
a
long
silent
installation
had
called
the
attention
of
the
baldies
to
their
wrecked
ship
to
the
terrans
looting
it
only
by
the
merest
chance
had
the
vengeance
of
the
stellar
spacemen
fallen
then
on
the
russian
investigators
and
not
on
his
own
people
he
knew
better
than
to
touch
anything
before
the
pilot
station
but
the
banks
of
controls
to
one
side
were
concerned
with
the
inner
of
the
ship
and
they
tempted
him
to
go
it
blind
was
however
more
of
a
risk
than
he
dared
take
there
was
one
future
precaution
for
him
from
a
very
familiar
case
beside
the
pilot
seat
ross
gathered
up
a
collection
of
disks
sorted
through
them
hastily
for
one
which
bore
a
certain
symbol
on
its
covering
there
was
only
one
of
those
slapping
the
rest
back
into
their
container
ross
pressed
a
button
on
the
control
board
again
his
guess
paid
off
another
disk
was
exposed
as
a
small
panel
slid
back
ross
clawed
that
out
of
the
holder
put
in
its
place
the
one
he
had
found
now
if
his
choice
had
been
correct
the
crew
who
took
off
in
this
ship
unless
they
checked
their
route
tape
first
would
find
themselves
heading
to
another
primitive
planet
and
not
returning
to
base
perhaps
exhaustion
of
fuel
might
ground
them
past
hope
of
ever
regaining
their
home
port
again
next
to
damaging
the
ship
which
he
could
not
do
this
was
the
best
thing
to
assure
that
any
enemy
leaving
hawaika
would
not
speedily
return
with
a
second
expeditionary
force
ross
dropped
the
route
disk
he
had
taken
out
into
a
pocket
on
his
belt
to
be
destroyed
when
he
had
the
chance
now
he
catfooted
across
the
deck
to
look
into
the
well
and
listen
the
walls
glowed
with
a
diffused
light
from
here
the
terran
could
count
at
least
four
levels
under
him
with
perhaps
another
the
bottom
two
ought
to
be
supplies
and
general
storage
then
the
engine
room
tech
labs
above
and
next
to
the
control
cabin
the
living
quarters
through
the
fabric
of
the
ship
shivering
up
his
body
from
the
soles
of
his
feet
he
could
feel
the
vibration
of
engines
at
work
one
such
must
control
the
force
field
which
ringed
this
canyon
perhaps
even
powered
the
weapons
the
invaders
could
turn
against
any
assault
ross
whirled
about
his
foanna
cloak
in
a
wide
swing
there
was
one
control
which
he
knew
yes
again
the
board
was
the
same
as
the
one
he
was
familiar
with
his
hand
plunged
out
and
down
raking
the
lever
from
one
measure
point
to
the
very
end
of
the
slit
in
which
it
moved
then
he
planted
himself
with
his
back
to
the
wall
whoever
came
up
the
well
hunting
the
cause
for
the
failure
would
be
facing
the
other
way
ross
crouched
a
little
pushing
the
cape
well
back
on
his
shoulders
to
free
his
arms
there
was
a
feline
suppleness
in
his
stance
just
as
a
jungle
cat
might
wait
coming
of
its
prey
what
he
heard
was
a
shout
below
the
click
of
on
the
rungs
of
the
level
ladder
ross
lips
drew
back
in
a
snarl
which
was
also
feline
he
thought
that
would
do
it
spacemen
were
to
any
failure
in
air
flow
white
head
bare
of
any
hair
thin
shoulders
a
little
hunched
under
the
stuff
of
the
baldies
uniforms
head
turning
now
so
that
the
eyes
could
see
the
necessary
switch
an
exclamation
from
the
alien
and
but
the
baldy
never
had
a
chance
to
complete
that
turn
look
behind
him
ross
sprang
and
struck
with
the
side
of
his
hand
the
hairless
head
snapped
forward
his
hands
already
hooked
in
the
other
armpits
the
terran
heaved
the
alien
up
and
over
onto
the
deck
of
the
control
cabin
it
was
only
when
he
was
about
to
bind
his
captive
that
ross
discovered
the
baldy
was
dead
a
blow
calculated
to
stun
the
alien
had
been
too
severe
breathing
a
little
faster
the
terran
rolled
the
body
back
and
hoisted
it
into
the
navigator
fastening
it
with
the
belts
one
down
how
many
left
he
had
little
time
to
wonder
for
before
he
could
reach
the
well
once
again
there
was
a
call
from
below
sharp
and
demanding
the
terran
searched
his
victim
but
the
baldy
was
unarmed
again
a
shout
then
silence
too
complete
a
silence
how
could
they
have
guessed
trouble
so
quickly
unless
unless
the
baldies
mental
communication
had
been
at
work
they
might
even
now
know
their
fellow
was
dead
but
not
how
he
died
ross
was
prepared
to
grant
the
baldies
abilities
but
he
did
not
see
how
they
could
know
what
had
happened
here
they
could
only
suspect
danger
not
know
the
form
it
had
taken
and
sooner
or
later
one
of
them
must
come
to
adjust
the
switch
this
could
be
a
duel
of
patience
ross
squatted
at
the
edge
of
the
well
trying
to
make
his
ears
supply
him
with
hints
of
what
might
be
happening
below
had
there
been
an
alteration
in
the
volume
of
vibration
he
set
his
palm
flat
to
the
deck
tried
to
deduce
the
truth
but
he
could
not
be
sure
that
there
had
been
some
slight
change
he
was
certain
they
could
not
wait
much
longer
without
making
an
attempt
to
reopen
the
regulator
or
could
they
again
ross
was
hampered
by
lack
of
information
perhaps
the
baldies
did
not
need
the
same
amount
of
oxygen
his
own
kind
depended
upon
and
if
that
were
true
ross
could
be
the
first
to
suffer
in
playing
a
waiting
game
well
air
was
not
the
only
thing
he
could
cut
off
from
here
though
it
had
been
the
first
and
most
important
to
his
mind
ross
hesitated
weapons
cut
in
both
directions
but
he
had
to
force
a
countermove
from
them
he
pulled
another
switch
the
control
cabin
the
whole
of
the
ship
was
plunged
into
darkness
no
sound
from
below
this
time
ross
pictured
the
interior
layout
of
the
ships
he
had
known
two
levels
down
to
reach
the
engine
room
could
he
descend
undetected
there
was
only
one
way
to
test
that
try
it
he
pulled
the
foanna
cloak
about
him
was
several
rungs
down
on
the
ladder
when
the
glow
in
the
walls
came
on
an
emergency
switch
with
a
forward
scramble
ross
swung
into
one
of
the
radiating
side
corridors
the
panels
along
it
were
all
closed
he
could
detect
no
sounds
behind
them
but
the
vibration
in
the
ship
walls
had
returned
to
its
steady
beat
now
the
terran
realized
the
folly
of
his
move
he
was
more
securely
trapped
here
than
he
had
been
in
the
control
cabin
there
was
only
one
way
out
up
or
down
the
ladder
and
the
enemy
could
have
that
under
observation
from
below
all
they
would
need
to
do
was
to
use
a
flamer
or
a
paralyzing
ray
such
as
the
one
he
had
turned
over
to
ashe
several
days
ago
ross
inched
along
to
the
stairwell
a
faint
pad
of
movement
a
shadow
of
sound
from
the
ladder
someone
on
the
way
up
could
they
mentally
detect
him
know
him
for
an
alien
intruder
by
the
broadcast
of
his
thoughts
the
baldies
had
a
certain
respect
for
the
foanna
and
might
desire
to
take
one
alive
he
drew
the
robe
about
him
used
it
to
muffle
his
figure
completely
as
the
true
wearers
did
but
the
figure
pulling
painfully
up
from
rung
to
rung
was
no
baldy
the
lean
hawaikan
arms
the
thin
hawaikan
face
drawn
of
feature
painfully
blank
of
expression
loketh
under
the
same
dread
spell
as
had
held
the
warriors
in
the
citadel
courtyard
could
the
aliens
be
using
this
hawaikan
captive
as
a
defense
shield
moving
up
behind
him
loketh
head
turned
those
blank
eyes
regarded
ross
and
their
depths
were
troubled
recognition
of
a
sort
returning
the
hawaikan
threw
up
one
hand
in
a
beseeching
gesture
and
then
went
to
his
knees
in
the
corridor
great
one
great
one
the
words
came
from
his
lips
in
a
breathy
hiss
as
he
groveled
then
his
body
went
flaccid
and
he
sprawled
face
down
his
twisted
leg
drawn
up
as
if
he
would
run
but
could
not
foanna
the
one
word
came
out
of
the
walls
themselves
or
so
it
seemed
foanna
the
wise
learn
what
lies
before
them
when
they
walk
alone
in
the
dark
the
hawaikan
speech
was
stilted
accented
but
understandable
ross
stood
motionless
had
they
somehow
seen
him
through
loketh
eyes
or
had
they
been
alerted
merely
by
the
hawaikan
call
they
believed
he
was
one
of
the
foanna
well
he
would
play
that
role
foanna
sharper
this
time
demanding
you
lie
in
our
hand
let
us
clasp
the
fingers
tightly
and
you
shall
be
naught
out
of
somewhere
the
words
karara
had
chanted
in
the
foanna
temple
came
to
ross
not
in
her
polynesian
tongue
but
in
the
english
she
had
repeated
and
softening
his
voice
to
his
best
approximation
of
the
foanna
singsong
ross
sang
ye
forty
thousand
gods
ye
gods
of
sea
of
sky
of
stars
he
improvised
ye
elders
of
the
gods
that
are
ye
gods
that
once
were
ye
that
whisper
yet
that
watch
by
night
ye
that
show
your
gleaming
eyes
foanna
the
summons
was
on
the
ragged
edge
of
patience
your
tricks
will
not
move
our
mountains
ye
gods
of
mountains
ross
returned
of
valleys
of
shades
and
not
the
shadow
he
wove
in
the
beliefs
of
this
world
too
walk
now
this
world
between
the
stars
his
confidence
was
growing
and
there
was
no
use
in
remaining
pent
in
this
corridor
he
would
have
to
chance
that
they
were
not
prepared
to
kill
summarily
one
of
the
foanna
ross
went
to
the
well
went
down
the
ladder
slowly
keeping
his
robe
about
him
here
at
the
next
level
there
was
a
wider
space
about
the
opening
and
three
door
panels
behind
one
must
be
those
he
sought
he
was
buoyed
up
by
a
curious
belief
in
himself
almost
as
if
wearing
this
robe
did
give
him
in
part
the
power
attributed
to
the
foanna
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
door
to
his
right
and
sent
it
snapping
back
into
its
frame
stepped
inside
as
if
he
entered
here
by
right
there
were
three
baldies
to
his
terran
eyes
they
were
all
superficially
alike
but
the
one
seated
on
a
control
stool
had
a
cold
arrogance
in
his
expression
a
pitiless
half
smile
which
made
ross
face
him
squarely
the
terran
longed
for
one
of
the
foanna
staffs
and
the
ability
to
use
it
to
spray
that
energy
about
this
cabin
might
reduce
the
baldy
defenses
to
nothing
but
now
two
of
the
paralyzing
tubes
were
trained
on
him
you
have
come
to
us
foanna
what
have
you
to
offer
demanded
the
commander
if
that
was
his
rank
offer
for
the
first
time
ross
spoke
there
is
no
reason
for
the
foanna
to
make
any
offer
slayer
of
women
and
children
you
have
come
from
the
stars
to
take
but
that
does
not
mean
we
choose
to
give
he
felt
it
now
that
inner
pulling
twisting
in
his
mind
the
willing
which
was
their
more
subtle
weapon
once
they
had
almost
bent
him
with
that
willing
because
then
he
had
worn
their
livery
a
spacesuit
taken
from
the
wrecked
freighter
now
he
did
not
have
that
chink
in
his
defense
and
all
that
stubborn
independence
and
determination
to
be
himself
alone
resisted
the
influence
with
a
fierce
inner
fire
we
offer
life
to
you
foanna
freedom
of
the
stars
these
other
dirt
creepers
are
nothing
to
you
why
take
you
weapons
in
their
cause
you
are
not
of
the
same
race
nor
are
you
ross
hands
moved
under
the
envelope
of
the
robe
unloosing
the
two
hidden
clasps
which
held
it
that
bank
of
controls
before
which
the
commander
sat
to
silence
that
would
cause
trouble
and
he
depended
upon
ynlan
the
rovers
should
now
be
massed
at
either
end
of
the
canyon
waiting
for
the
force
field
to
fail
and
let
them
in
ross
steadied
himself
poised
for
action
we
have
something
for
you
star
men
he
tried
to
hold
their
attention
with
words
have
you
not
heard
of
the
power
of
the
foanna
that
they
can
command
wind
and
wave
that
they
can
be
where
they
were
not
in
a
single
movement
of
the
eyelid
and
this
is
so
behold
it
was
the
oldest
trick
in
the
world
perhaps
on
any
planet
but
because
it
was
so
old
maybe
it
had
been
forgotten
by
the
aliens
for
as
ross
pointed
those
heads
did
turn
for
an
instant
he
was
in
the
air
the
robe
gathered
in
his
arms
wide
spread
as
bat
wings
and
then
they
crashed
in
a
tangle
which
bore
them
all
back
against
the
controls
ross
strove
to
enmesh
them
in
the
robe
using
the
pressure
of
his
body
to
slam
them
all
on
the
buttons
and
levers
of
the
board
whether
that
battering
would
accomplish
his
purpose
he
could
not
tell
but
that
he
had
only
these
few
seconds
torn
out
of
time
to
try
he
knew
and
determined
to
use
them
as
best
he
could
one
of
the
baldies
had
slithered
down
to
the
floor
and
another
was
aiming
strangely
ineffectual
blows
at
him
but
the
third
had
wriggled
free
to
bring
up
a
paralyzer
ross
slewed
around
dragging
the
alien
he
held
across
his
body
just
as
the
other
fired
but
though
the
fighter
went
limp
and
heavy
in
ross
hold
the
terran
own
right
arm
fell
to
his
side
his
upper
chest
was
numb
and
his
head
felt
as
if
one
of
the
rover
boarding
axes
had
clipped
it
ross
reeled
back
and
fell
his
left
hand
raking
down
the
controls
as
he
went
then
he
lay
on
the
cabin
floor
and
saw
the
convulsed
face
of
the
commander
above
him
a
paralyzer
aiming
at
his
middle
to
breathe
was
an
effort
ross
found
torture
to
endure
the
red
haze
in
his
head
filled
all
the
world
pain
he
strove
to
flee
the
pain
but
was
held
captive
in
it
and
always
the
pressure
on
him
kept
that
agony
steady
let
be
he
wanted
to
scream
that
perhaps
he
had
but
the
pressure
continued
then
he
forced
his
eyes
open
ashe
ashe
and
one
of
the
foanna
bending
over
him
ashe
hands
on
his
chest
pressing
relaxing
pressing
again
it
is
good
he
knew
ynvalda
voice
her
hand
rested
lightly
on
his
forehead
and
from
that
touch
ross
drew
again
the
quickening
of
body
and
spirit
he
had
felt
on
the
dancing
floor
how
he
began
and
then
changed
to
where
for
this
was
not
the
engine
room
of
the
spacer
he
lay
in
the
open
with
sweet
wind
filling
his
starved
lungs
now
without
ashe
force
aid
it
is
over
ashe
told
him
all
over
for
now
but
not
until
the
sun
reached
the
canyon
hours
later
and
they
sat
in
council
did
ross
learn
all
the
tale
just
as
he
had
made
his
own
plan
for
reaching
the
spacer
so
had
ashe
karara
and
the
dolphins
worked
on
a
similar
attempt
the
river
running
deep
in
those
mountain
gorges
had
provided
a
road
for
the
dolphins
and
they
found
beneath
its
surface
an
entrance
past
the
force
barrier
the
baldies
were
so
sure
of
their
superiority
on
this
primitive
world
they
set
no
guards
save
that
field
ashe
explained
we
slipped
through
five
swimmers
to
reach
the
ship
and
then
the
field
went
down
thanks
to
you
so
i
did
help
that
much
ross
grinned
wryly
what
had
he
proven
by
his
sortie
nothing
much
but
he
was
not
sorry
he
had
made
it
for
the
very
fact
he
had
done
it
on
his
own
had
eased
in
part
that
small
ache
which
was
in
him
now
when
he
looked
at
ashe
and
remembered
how
it
had
once
been
ashe
might
be
always
would
be
his
friend
but
the
old
comradeship
of
the
project
was
behind
them
vanished
like
the
time
gate
and
what
will
you
do
with
them
ross
nodded
toward
the
captives
the
three
from
the
ship
two
more
taken
from
the
small
scouting
globe
which
had
homed
to
find
their
enemies
ready
for
them
we
wait
ynvalda
said
for
those
on
the
rover
ship
to
be
brought
hither
by
our
laws
they
deserve
death
the
rovers
at
that
council
nodded
vigorously
all
save
torgul
and
jazia
the
rover
woman
spoke
first
they
bear
the
curse
of
phutka
heavy
on
them
to
live
under
such
a
curse
is
worse
than
a
clean
quick
dying
listen
it
has
come
upon
me
that
better
this
curse
not
only
eat
them
up
but
be
carried
by
them
to
rot
those
who
sent
them
together
the
foanna
nodded
there
has
been
enough
of
killing
said
ynlan
no
warriors
we
do
not
say
this
because
we
shrink
from
rightful
deaths
but
jazia
speaks
the
truth
in
this
matter
let
these
depart
perhaps
they
will
bear
that
with
them
which
will
convince
their
leaders
that
this
is
not
a
world
they
may
squeeze
in
their
hands
as
one
crushes
a
ripe
quaya
to
eat
its
seeds
you
believe
in
your
cursing
rovers
then
let
the
fruit
of
it
be
made
plain
beyond
the
stars
was
this
the
time
to
speak
of
the
switched
tapes
ross
wondered
no
he
did
not
really
believe
that
the
rover
curse
or
their
treatment
of
the
captives
would
either
one
influence
the
star
leaders
but
if
the
invaders
did
not
return
to
their
base
their
vanishing
might
also
work
to
keep
another
expedition
from
invading
hawaikan
skies
leave
it
to
chance
a
curse
and
time
so
it
was
decided
have
we
won
ross
asked
ashe
later
do
you
mean
have
we
changed
the
future
who
can
answer
that
they
may
return
in
force
this
may
have
been
a
step
which
was
taken
before
those
pylons
may
still
stand
in
the
future
above
a
deserted
sea
and
island
we
shall
probably
never
know
that
was
also
their
own
truth
for
them
also
there
had
been
a
substitution
of
journey
tapes
by
fate
and
this
was

yes
no
either
they
had
found
their
key
to
the
mystery
out
of

but
they
could
not
turn
it
and
there
was
no

to
