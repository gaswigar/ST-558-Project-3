the
white
linen
nurse
by
eleanor
hallowell
abbott
author
of
molly
the
lady
etc
to
maurice
howe
richardson
who
loved
romance
almost
as
much
as
he
loved
surgery
this
little
story
is
affectionately
dedicated
in
token
of
two
persons
unfading
memories
the
white
linen
nurse
chapter
i
the
white
linen
nurse
was
so
tired
that
her
noble
expression
ached
incidentally
her
head
ached
and
her
shoulders
ached
and
her
lungs
ached
and
the
of
both
feet
ached
quite
excruciatingly
but
nothing
of
her
felt
permanently
incapacitated
except
her
noble
expression
like
a
strip
of
lead
suspended
from
her
poor
little
nose
by
two
tugging
wrinkles
her
persistently
conscientious
sickroom
smile
seemed
to
be
whanging
aimlessly
against
her
front
teeth
the
sensation
certainly
was
very
unpleasant
looking
back
thus
on
the
three
years
of
her
hospital
training
it
dawned
on
the
white
linen
nurse
very
suddenly
that
nothing
of
her
ever
had
felt
permanently
incapacitated
except
her
noble
expression
impulsively
she
sprang
for
the
prim
white
mirror
that
capped
her
prim
white
bureau
and
stood
staring
up
into
her
own
entrancing
novia
scotian
reflection
with
tense
and
unwonted
interest
except
for
the
unmistakable
smirk
which
fatigue
had
clawed
into
her
plastic
young
there
was
certainly
nothing
special
the
matter
with
what
she
saw
perfectly
good
face
she
attested
judicially
with
no
more
than
common
courtesy
to
her
progenitors
perfectly
good
and
tidy
looking
face
if
only
if
only
her
breath
caught
a
trifle
if
only
it
did
look
so
disgustingly
noble
and
hygienic
and
dollish
all
along
the
back
of
her
neck
little
sharp
prickly
pains
began
suddenly
to
sting
and
burn
silly
simpering
pink
and
white
puppet
she
scolded
squintingly
i
teach
you
how
to
look
like
a
real
girl
very
threateningly
she
raised
herself
to
her
tiptoes
and
thrust
her
glowing
corporeal
face
right
up
into
the
moulten
elusive
face
in
the
mirror
pink
for
pink
blue
for
blue
gold
for
gold
dollish
smirk
for
dollish
smirk
the
mirror
mocked
her
seething
inner
fretfulness
why
darn
you
she
gasped
why
darn
you
why
you
looked
more
human
than
that
when
you
left
the
annapolis
valley
three
years
ago
there
were
at
least
tears
in
your
face
then
and
cinders
and
your
mother
best
advice
and
the
worry
about
the
mortgage
and
and
the
blush
of
joe
hazeltine
kiss
furtively
with
the
tip
of
her
she
started
to
search
her
imperturbable
pink
cheek
for
the
spot
where
joe
hazeltine
kiss
had
formerly
flamed
my
hands
are
all
right
anyway
she
acknowledged
with
infinite
relief
triumphantly
she
raised
both
strong
exaggeratedly
executive
hands
to
the
level
of
her
childish
blue
eyes
and
stood
surveying
the
mirrored
effect
with
ineffable
satisfaction
why
my
hands
are
dandy
she
gloated
why
they
perfectly
dandy
why
wonderful
why
they
then
suddenly
and
fearfully
she
gave
a
shrill
little
scream
but
they
do
go
with
my
silly
she
cried
why
they
do
they
do
they
go
with
the
senior
scowling
heidelberg
eyes
they
go
with
the
senior
surgeon
grim
gray
jaw
they
go
with
the
oh
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
dizzily
with
her
stubby
prodded
deep
into
every
jaded
facial
muscle
that
she
could
compass
she
staggered
towards
the
air
and
dropping
down
into
the
first
friendly
chair
that
bumped
against
her
knees
sat
staring
blankly
out
across
the
monotonous
city
roofs
that
flanked
her
open
window
trying
very
very
hard
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
to
consider
the
all
around
and
about
her
inexorable
as
anesthesia
horrid
as
the
hush
of
tomb
or
public
library
lurked
the
painfully
unmistakable
sense
of
institutional
restraint
mournfully
to
her
ear
from
some
remote
kitcheny
region
of
pots
and
pans
a
browsing
spoon
tinkled
forth
from
time
to
time
with
resonance
up
and
down
every
clammy
white
corridor
innumerable
young
feet
born
to
prance
and
stamp
were
creeping
stealthily
to
and
fro
in
whispers
along
the
somber
just
below
her
windowsill
like
a
covey
of
snubbed
doves
six
or
eight
of
her
classmates
were
cooing
and
crooning
together
with
excessive
caution
concerning
the
imminent
graduation
exercises
that
were
to
take
place
at
eight
that
very
evening
beyond
her
dreariest
ken
of
muffled
voices
beyond
her
dingiest
vista
of
slate
and
brick
on
a
far
faint
hillside
a
far
faint
streak
of
april
green
went
roaming
jocundly
skyward
altogether
sluggishly
as
though
her
nostrils
were
plugged
with
warm
velvet
the
smell
of
spring
and
ether
and
scorched
filtered
in
and
out
in
and
out
in
and
out
of
her
abnormally
jaded
senses
taken
all
in
all
it
was
not
a
propitious
afternoon
for
any
girl
as
tired
and
as
pretty
as
the
white
linen
nurse
to
be
considering
the
general
phenomenon
of
anything
except
april
in
the
real
country
they
tell
me
where
the
young
spring
runs
wild
and
bare
as
a
nymph
through
every
dull
brown
wood
and
meadow
the
blas√©
will
not
even
lift
his
eyes
from
the
plow
to
watch
the
pinkness
of
her
passing
but
here
in
the
prudish
city
where
the
young
spring
at
her
friskiest
is
nothing
more
audacious
than
a
sweltering
madcap
who
has
impishly
essayed
some
fine
morning
to
tiptoe
down
street
in
her
soft
sloozily
green
feet
the
whole
population
reels
back
aghast
and
agrin
before
the
most
innocent
flash
of
the
rogue
toes
and
then
suddenly
snatching
off
its
own
cumbersome
winter
goes
chasing
madly
after
her
in
its
own
prankish
socks
now
the
white
linen
nurse
socks
were
black
and
cotton
at
that
a
combination
incontestably
sedate
and
the
white
linen
nurse
had
waded
barefoot
through
too
many
posied
country
pastures
to
experience
any
ordinary
city
thrill
over
the
sight
of
a
single
blade
of
grass
pushing
scarily
through
a
crack
in
the
pavement
or
puny
maple
tree
flushing
wanly
to
the
smoky
sky
indeed
for
three
hustling
city
years
the
white
linen
nurse
had
never
even
stopped
to
notice
whether
the
season
was
flavored
with
frost
or
thunder
but
now
unexplainably
just
at
the
end
of
it
all
sitting
innocently
there
at
her
own
prim
little
window
staring
innocently
out
across
indomitable
with
the
crackle
of
glory
and
diplomas
already
ringing
in
her
ears
she
heard
instead
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
the
gaily
voice
of
the
spring
a
hoydenish
challenge
flung
back
at
her
from
the
crest
of
a
hill
hello
white
linen
nurse
screamed
the
saucy
city
spring
hello
white
linen
nurse
take
off
your
homely
starched
collar
or
your
silly
cap
or
any
other
thing
that
feels
maddeningly
artificial
and
come
out
and
be
very
wild
like
a
puppy
dog
cocking
its
head
towards
some
strange
unfamiliar
sound
the
white
linen
nurse
cocked
her
head
towards
the
lure
of
the
hill
still
wrestling
conscientiously
with
the
she
found
her
collar
suddenly
very
tight
the
tiny
cap
inexpressibly
heavy
and
vexatious
timidly
she
removed
the
collar
and
found
that
the
removal
did
not
rest
her
in
the
slightest
equally
timidly
she
removed
the
cap
and
found
that
even
that
removal
did
not
rest
her
in
the
slightest
then
very
very
slowly
but
very
very
permeatingly
and
completely
it
dawned
on
the
white
linen
nurse
that
never
while
eyes
were
blue
and
hair
gold
and
lips
red
would
she
ever
find
rest
again
until
she
had
removed
her
noble
expression
with
a
jerk
that
started
the
pulses
in
her
temples
throbbing
like
two
toothaches
she
straightened
up
in
her
chair
all
along
the
back
of
her
neck
the
little
blonde
curls
began
to
crisp
very
ticklingly
at
their
roots
still
staring
worriedly
out
over
the
old
city
head
to
that
inciting
prance
of
green
across
the
farthest
horizon
she
felt
her
whole
being
kindle
to
an
indescribable
passion
of
revolt
against
all
hushed
places
seething
with
fatigue
smoldering
with
ennui
she
experienced
suddenly
a
wild
almost
incontrollable
impulse
to
sing
to
shout
to
scream
from
the
housetops
to
mock
somebody
to
defy
everybody
to
break
laws
dishes
heads
anything
in
fact
that
would
break
with
a
crash
and
then
at
last
over
the
hills
and
far
away
with
all
the
outraged
world
at
her
heels
to
run
and
run
and
run
and
run
and
run
and
laugh
till
her
feet
raveled
out
and
her
lungs
burst
and
there
was
nothing
more
left
of
her
at
all
ever
ever
any
more
discordantly
into
this
rapturously
pagan
vision
of
pranks
and
posies
broke
one
of
her
all
awhiff
with
ether
awhirr
with
starch
instantly
with
the
first
creak
of
the
the
white
linen
nurse
was
on
her
feet
breathless
resentful
grotesquely
defiant
get
out
of
here
zillah
forsyth
she
cried
furiously
get
out
of
here
quick
and
leave
me
alone
i
want
to
think
perfectly
serenely
the
newcomer
advanced
into
the
room
with
her
pale
cheeks
her
great
limpid
brown
eyes
her
soft
dark
hair
parted
across
her
beautiful
brow
her
whole
face
was
like
some
exquisite
composite
picture
of
all
the
saints
of
history
her
voice
also
was
amazingly
tranquil
oh
fudge
she
drawled
what
eating
you
rae
malgregor
i
either
get
out
it
my
room
just
as
much
as
it
is
yours
and
just
as
much
as
it
is
ours
and
besides
she
added
more
briskly
four
now
and
with
graduation
at
eight
and
the
dance
afterwards
if
we
do
get
our
stuff
packed
up
now
when
in
thunder
shall
we
get
it
done
quite
irrelevantly
she
began
to
laugh
her
laugh
was
perceptibly
shriller
than
her
speaking
voice
say
rae
she
confided
that
minister
i
nursed
through
pneumonia
last
winter
wants
me
to
pose
as
for
a
window
in
his
new
church
is
he
the
softie
shall
you
do
it
quizzed
rae
malgregor
a
trifle
tensely
shall
i
do
it
mocked
the
newcomer
well
you
just
watch
me
four
mornings
a
week
in
june
at
full
week
wages
fresh
easter
lilies
every
day
white
silk
all
the
and
kowtowing
around
me
why
it
would
be
more
fun
than
a
box
of
monkeys
sure
i
do
it
expeditiously
as
she
spoke
the
newcomer
reached
up
for
the
framed
motto
over
her
own
ample
mirror
and
yanking
it
down
with
one
single
tug
began
to
busy
herself
adroitly
with
a
snarl
in
the
like
a
withe
of
willow
yearning
over
a
brook
her
slender
figure
curved
to
the
task
very
scintillatingly
the
afternoon
light
seemed
to
brighten
suddenly
across
her
lap
be
a
long
time
dead
glinted
the
motto
through
its
glass
still
panting
with
excitement
still
bristling
with
resentment
rae
malgregor
stood
surveying
the
intrusion
and
the
intruder
a
dozen
impertinent
speeches
were
rioting
in
her
mind
twice
her
mouth
opened
and
shut
before
she
finally
achieved
the
particular
opprobrium
that
completely
satisfied
her
bah
you
look
like
a
trained
nurse
she
blurted
forth
at
last
with
hysterical
triumph
so
do
you
said
the
newcomer
amiably
with
a
little
gasp
of
dismay
rae
malgregor
sprang
suddenly
forward
her
eyes
were
flooded
with
tears
why
that
just
exactly
what
the
matter
with
me
she
cried
my
face
is
all
worn
out
trying
to
look
like
a
trained
nurse
oh
zillah
how
do
you
know
you
were
meant
to
be
a
trained
nurse
how
does
anybody
know
oh
zillah
save
me
save
me
languorously
zillah
forsyth
looked
up
from
her
work
and
laughed
her
laugh
was
like
the
accidental
tinkle
of
sleighbells
in
vaguely
disquieting
a
shiver
of
frost
across
the
face
of
a
lily
save
you
from
what
you
great
big
overgrown
she
questioned
blandly
for
heaven
sake
the
only
thing
you
need
is
to
go
back
to
whatever
you
came
from
and
get
a
new
head
what
in
creation
the
matter
with
you
lately
anyway
oh
of
course
you
had
rotten
luck
this
past
month
but
what
of
it
that
the
trouble
with
you
country
girls
you
have
got
any
stamina
with
slow
astonishment
rae
malgregor
stepped
out
into
the
center
of
the
room
country
girls
she
repeated
blankly
why
you
a
country
girl
yourself
i
not
snapped
zillah
forsyth
i
have
you
understand
that
there
are
nine
thousand
people
in
the
town
i
come
from
and
not
a
rube
among
them
why
i
tended
soda
fountain
in
the
swellest
there
a
whole
year
before
i
even
thought
of
taking
up
nursing
and
i
was
as
green
when
i
was
six
months
old
as
you
are
now
slowly
with
a
sigh
of
contentment
she
raised
her
slim
white
fingers
to
coax
her
dusky
hair
a
little
looser
a
little
farther
down
a
little
more
across
her
sweet
mild
forehead
then
snatching
out
abruptly
at
a
convenient
began
with
extraordinary
skill
to
apply
its
dangly
lace
sleeves
as
a
protective
bandage
for
the
delicate
motto
still
in
her
lap
placed
the
completed
parcel
with
inordinate
scientific
precision
in
the
exact
corner
of
her
and
then
went
on
very
diligently
very
zealously
to
strip
the
men
photographs
from
the
mirror
on
her
bureau
there
were
photographs
in
all
and
for
each
one
she
had
already
cut
and
prepared
a
small
square
of
perfectly
fresh
perfectly
immaculate
white
tissue
no
one
so
transcendently
fastidious
so
exquisitely
neat
in
all
her
personal
habits
had
ever
trained
in
that
particular
hospital
before
very
soberly
the
girl
stood
watching
the
men
pleasant
paper
countenances
smooth
away
one
by
one
into
their
chaste
white
veilings
until
at
last
quite
without
warning
she
poked
an
accusing
inquisitive
finger
directly
across
zillah
forsyth
shoulder
zillah
she
demanded
peremptorily
all
the
year
i
wanted
to
know
all
the
year
every
other
girl
in
our
class
has
wanted
to
know
where
did
you
ever
get
that
picture
of
the
senior
surgeon
he
never
gave
it
to
you
in
the
world
he
did
he
did
he
not
that
kind
deeply
into
zillah
forsyth
pale
ascetic
cheek
dawned
a
most
amazing
dimple
sort
of
jarred
you
girls
some
did
it
she
queried
to
see
me
strutting
round
with
a
photo
of
the
senior
surgeon
the
little
cleft
in
her
chin
showed
suddenly
with
almost
startling
distinctness
well
seeing
it
you
she
grinned
and
the
year
all
over
and
nobody
left
that
i
can
worry
about
it
any
more
i
do
mind
telling
you
in
the
least
that
i
bought
it
out
of
a
photographer
there
are
you
satisfied
now
with
easy
nonchalance
she
picked
up
the
picture
in
question
and
scrutinized
it
shrewdly
lord
what
a
face
she
attested
nothing
but
granite
hack
him
with
a
knife
and
he
would
bleed
but
just
chip
off
into
pebbles
with
exaggerated
contempt
she
shrugged
her
supple
shoulders
bah
how
i
hate
a
man
like
that
there
no
fun
in
him
a
little
abruptly
she
turned
and
thrust
the
photograph
into
rae
malgregor
hand
you
can
have
it
if
you
want
to
she
said
i
trade
it
to
you
for
that
lace
of
yours
like
water
dripping
through
a
sieve
the
photograph
slid
through
rae
malgregor
frightened
fingers
with
nervous
apology
she
stooped
and
picked
it
up
again
and
held
it
gingerly
by
one
remotest
corner
her
eyes
were
quite
wide
with
horror
oh
of
course
i
like
the
picture
well
enough
she
stammered
but
it
would
seem
exactly
respectful
to
to
trade
it
for
a
oh
very
well
drawled
zillah
forsyth
tear
it
up
then
expeditiously
with
frank
fingers
rae
malgregor
tore
the
tough
cardboard
across
and
again
across
and
once
again
across
and
threw
the
conglomerate
fragments
into
the
and
her
expression
all
the
time
was
no
more
no
less
than
the
expression
of
a
person
who
would
infinitely
rather
execute
his
own
pet
dog
or
cat
than
risk
the
possible
bungling
of
an
outsider
then
like
a
small
child
trotting
with
infinite
relief
to
its
own
she
trotted
over
to
her
bureau
extracted
the
lace
and
came
back
with
it
in
her
hand
to
lean
across
zillah
forsyth
shoulder
again
and
watch
the
men
faces
go
slipping
off
into
oblivion
once
again
abruptly
without
warning
she
halted
the
process
with
a
breathless
exclamation
oh
of
course
this
waist
is
the
only
one
i
got
with
ribbons
in
it
she
asserted
irrelevantly
but
i
perfectly
willing
to
trade
it
for
that
picture
she
pointed
out
with
unmistakably
explicit
chucklingly
zillah
forsyth
withdrew
the
special
photograph
from
its
wrappings
oh
him
she
said
oh
that
a
chap
i
met
on
the
train
last
summer
he
a
brakeman
or
something
he
a
perfectly
unreluctantly
rae
malgregor
dropped
the
fluff
of
lace
and
ribbons
into
zillah
lap
and
reached
out
with
cheerful
voraciousness
to
annex
the
young
man
picture
to
her
somewhat
bleak
possessions
oh
i
do
care
a
rap
who
he
is
she
interrupted
briskly
but
he
sort
of
and
i
got
an
empty
frame
at
home
just
that
odd
size
and
mother
crazy
for
a
new
picture
to
stick
up
over
the
kitchen
mantelpiece
she
gets
so
tired
of
seeing
nothing
but
the
faces
of
people
she
knows
all
about
sharply
zillah
forsyth
turned
and
stared
up
into
the
younger
face
and
found
no
guile
to
whet
her
stare
against
well
of
all
the
ridiculous
unmitigated
greenhorns
she
began
well
is
that
all
you
wanted
him
for
why
i
supposed
you
wanted
to
write
to
him
why
i
supposed
for
the
first
time
an
expression
not
altogether
dollish
darkened
across
rae
malgregor
garishly
juvenile
blondeness
maybe
i
not
quite
as
green
as
you
think
i
am
she
flared
up
stormily
with
this
sharp
every
single
individual
pulse
in
her
body
seemed
to
jerk
itself
suddenly
into
conscious
activity
again
like
the
soft
plushy
of
a
whole
regiment
of
pain
descending
single
file
upon
her
for
her
hysterical
undoing
maybe
i
had
a
good
deal
more
experience
than
you
give
me
credit
for
she
hastened
excitedly
to
explain
i
tell
you
i
tell
you
i
been
engaged
she
blurted
forth
with
a
bitter
sort
of
triumph
with
a
palpable
flicker
of
interest
zillah
forsyth
looked
back
across
her
shoulder
engaged
how
many
times
she
asked
quite
bluntly
as
though
the
whole
monogamous
groundwork
of
civilization
was
threatened
by
the
question
rae
malgregor
hands
went
clutching
at
her
breast
why
once
she
gasped
why
once
convulsively
zillah
forsyth
began
to
rock
herself
to
and
fro
oh
lordy
she
chuckled
oh
lordy
lordy
why
i
been
engaged
four
times
just
this
past
year
in
a
sudden
passion
of
fastidiousness
she
bent
down
over
the
particular
photograph
in
her
hand
and
snatching
at
a
handkerchief
began
to
rub
diligently
at
a
small
smouch
of
dust
in
one
corner
of
the
cardboard
something
in
the
effort
of
rubbing
seemed
to
jerk
her
small
round
chin
into
almost
angular
prominence
and
before
i
through
she
added
at
least
two
notes
below
her
usual
alto
tones
and
before
i
through
i
going
to
get
engaged
to
every
profession
that
there
is
on
the
surface
of
the
globe
quite
helplessly
the
thin
paper
skin
of
the
photograph
peeled
off
in
company
with
the
smouch
of
dust
and
when
i
marry
she
ejaculated
fiercely
and
when
i
marry
i
going
to
marry
a
man
who
will
take
me
to
every
place
that
there
is
on
the
surface
of
the
globe
and
after
that
after
what
interrogated
a
brand
new
voice
from
the
doorway
chapter
ii
it
was
the
other
this
time
the
only
real
aristocrat
in
the
whole
graduating
class
eyes
like
some
young
prophet
mouth
even
yet
faintly
arrogant
with
the
ineradicable
consciousness
of
caste
a
plain
eager
type
of
face
this
was
helene
churchill
there
was
certainly
no
innocuous
bloom
of
country
hills
and
pastures
in
this
girl
face
nor
any
seething
passion
pounding
indiscriminately
at
all
the
doors
of
experience
the
men
and
women
who
had
bred
helene
churchill
had
been
the
breeders
also
of
brick
and
granite
cities
since
the
world
was
new
like
one
infinitely
more
accustomed
to
treading
on
persian
carpets
than
on
painted
floors
she
came
forward
into
the
room
hello
children
she
said
casually
and
began
at
once
without
further
parleying
to
take
down
the
motto
that
graced
her
own
it
was
the
era
when
almost
everybody
in
the
world
had
a
motto
over
his
bureau
helene
churchill
motto
was
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
these
ye
have
done
it
unto
on
a
scroll
of
almost
priceless
parchment
the
text
was
illuminated
with
inimitable
florentine
skill
and
color
a
little
carelessly
after
the
manner
of
people
quite
accustomed
to
priceless
things
she
proceeded
now
to
roll
the
parchment
into
its
smallest
possible
circumference
humming
exclusively
to
herself
all
the
while
an
intricate
little
air
from
an
italian
opera
so
the
three
faces
foiled
each
other
sober
city
girl
pert
town
girl
bucolic
country
girl
a
hundred
fundamental
differences
rampant
between
them
yet
each
fervid
adolescent
young
mouth
tamed
to
the
same
monotonous
drolly
exaggerated
expression
of
complacency
that
characterizes
the
faces
of
all
people
who
in
a
distinctive
uniform
for
a
reasonably
satisfactory
living
wage
make
an
actual
profession
of
righteous
deeds
indeed
among
all
the
thirty
or
more
varieties
of
noble
expression
which
an
indomitable
superintendent
had
finally
succeeded
in
inculcating
into
her
graduating
class
no
other
physiognomies
had
responded
more
plastically
perhaps
than
these
three
to
the
merciless
imprint
of
the
great
which
in
pursuance
of
its
one
repetitive
design
had
coaxed
zillah
forsyth
into
the
semblance
of
a
lady
snubbed
helene
churchill
into
the
substance
of
plain
womanhood
and
still
uncertain
just
what
to
do
with
rae
malgregor
rollicking
rural
immaturity
had
frozen
her
face
temporarily
into
the
smugly
dimpled
likeness
of
a
fancy
french
doll
rigged
out
as
a
nurse
for
some
hospital
fair
with
characteristic
desire
to
keep
up
in
every
way
with
her
more
mature
better
educated
classmates
to
do
everything
in
fact
so
fast
so
well
that
no
one
should
possibly
guess
that
she
had
yet
figured
out
just
why
she
was
doing
it
at
all
rae
malgregor
now
with
quickly
readjusted
cap
and
collar
began
to
hurl
herself
into
the
task
of
her
own
packing
from
her
open
bureau
drawer
with
a
sudden
impish
impulse
towards
worldly
wisdom
she
extracted
first
of
all
the
photograph
of
the
young
brakeman
see
helene
my
new
beau
she
giggled
experimentally
in
surprise
helene
churchill
glanced
up
from
her
work
beau
she
corrected
why
that
zillah
picture
well
it
mine
now
snapped
rae
malgregor
with
unexpected
edginess
it
mine
now
all
right
zillah
said
i
could
have
him
zillah
said
i
could
write
to
him
if
i
wanted
to
she
finished
a
bit
breathlessly
wider
and
wider
helene
churchill
eyes
dilated
write
to
a
man
whom
you
do
know
she
gasped
why
rae
why
it
is
even
very
nice
to
have
a
picture
of
a
man
you
do
know
mockingly
to
the
edge
of
her
strong
white
teeth
rae
malgregor
tongue
crept
out
in
pink
derision
bah
she
taunted
what
the
whole
matter
with
you
helene
churchill
you
never
stop
to
consider
whether
anything
fun
or
not
all
you
care
is
whether
it
excitedly
she
turned
to
meet
the
cheap
little
wink
from
sainted
eyes
bah
what
she
persisted
a
little
lamely
then
suddenly
all
the
pertness
within
her
crumbled
into
nothingness
that
the
whole
trouble
with
you
zillah
forsyth
she
stammered
you
never
give
a
hang
whether
anything
nice
or
not
all
you
care
is
whether
it
fun
quite
helplessly
she
began
to
wring
her
hands
oh
how
do
i
know
which
one
of
you
girls
to
follow
she
demanded
wildly
how
do
i
know
anything
how
does
anybody
know
anything
like
a
smoldering
fuse
the
rambling
query
crept
back
into
the
inner
recesses
of
her
brain
and
fired
once
more
the
one
great
question
that
lay
dormant
there
impetuously
she
ran
forward
and
stared
into
helene
churchill
face
how
do
you
know
you
were
meant
to
be
a
trained
nurse
helene
churchill
she
began
all
over
again
how
does
anybody
know
she
was
really
meant
to
be
one
how
can
anybody
i
mean
be
perfectly
sure
like
a
drowning
man
clutching
out
at
the
proverbial
straw
she
clutched
at
the
parchment
in
helene
churchill
hand
i
mean
where
did
you
get
your
motto
helene
churchill
she
persisted
with
increasing
irritability
if
you
do
tell
me
i
tear
the
whole
thing
to
pieces
with
a
startled
frown
helene
churchill
jerked
back
out
of
reach
the
matter
with
you
rae
she
quizzed
sharply
and
then
turning
round
quite
casually
to
her
began
to
draw
from
the
shelves
one
by
one
her
beloved
marcus
aurelius
wordsworth
robert
browning
oh
i
did
so
want
to
go
to
china
she
confided
irrelevantly
but
my
family
have
just
written
me
that
they
wo
stand
for
it
so
i
suppose
i
have
to
go
into
tenement
work
here
in
the
city
instead
with
a
visible
effort
she
jerked
her
mind
back
again
to
the
feverish
question
in
rae
malgregor
eyes
oh
you
want
to
know
where
i
got
my
motto
she
asked
a
flash
of
intuition
brightened
suddenly
across
her
oh
she
smiled
you
mean
you
want
to
know
just
what
the
incident
was
that
first
made
me
decide
to
devote
my
life
to
to
humanity
yes
snapped
rae
malgregor
a
little
shyly
helene
churchill
picked
up
her
copy
of
marcus
aurelius
and
cuddled
her
cheek
against
its
tender
morocco
cover
really
she
questioned
with
palpable
hesitation
really
you
want
to
know
why
why
it
rather
a
sacred
little
story
to
me
i
would
exactly
want
to
have
anybody
laugh
about
it
i
laugh
if
i
want
to
attested
zillah
forsyth
forcibly
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
like
a
pugnacious
boy
rae
malgregor
fluent
fingers
doubled
up
into
two
firm
fists
i
punch
her
if
she
even
looks
as
though
she
wanted
to
she
signaled
surreptitiously
to
helene
shrewdly
for
an
instant
the
city
girl
narrowing
eyes
challenged
and
appraised
the
country
girl
desperate
sincerity
then
quite
abruptly
she
began
her
little
story
why
it
was
on
an
easter
sunday
oh
ages
and
ages
ago
she
faltered
why
i
could
have
been
more
than
nine
years
old
at
the
time
a
trifle
she
turned
her
face
away
from
zillah
supercilious
smile
and
i
was
coming
home
from
a
sunday
school
festival
in
my
best
white
muslin
dress
with
a
big
pot
of
purple
pansies
in
my
hand
she
hastened
somewhat
nervously
to
explain
and
just
at
the
edge
of
the
gutter
there
was
a
dreadful
drunken
man
lying
in
the
mud
with
a
great
crowd
of
cruel
people
teasing
and
tormenting
him
and
because
because
i
could
think
of
anything
else
to
do
about
it
i
i
walked
right
up
to
the
poor
old
creature
scared
as
i
could
be
and
and
i
presented
him
with
my
pot
of
purple
pansies
and
everybody
of
course
began
to
laugh
to
scream
i
mean
and
shout
with
amusement
and
i
of
course
began
to
cry
and
the
old
drunken
man
straightened
up
very
oddly
for
an
instant
with
his
battered
hat
in
one
hand
and
the
pot
of
pansies
in
the
other
and
he
raised
the
pot
of
pansies
very
high
as
though
it
had
been
a
glass
of
rarest
wine
and
bowed
to
me
as
reverently
as
though
he
had
been
toasting
me
at
my
father
table
at
some
very
grand
dinner
and
he
said
just
that
so
that
how
i
happened
to
go
into
nursing
she
finished
as
abruptly
as
she
had
begun
like
some
wonderful
phosphorescent
manifestation
her
whole
shining
soul
seemed
to
flare
forth
suddenly
through
her
plain
face
with
honest
perplexity
zillah
forsyth
looked
up
from
her
work
so
that
how
you
happened
to
go
into
nursing
she
quizzed
impatiently
her
long
straight
nose
was
all
puckered
tight
with
interrogation
her
eyes
were
fairly
dilated
with
astonishment
you
do
mean
she
gasped
you
do
mean
that
just
for
that
incredulously
she
jumped
to
her
feet
and
stood
staring
blankly
into
the
city
girl
strangely
illuminated
features
well
if
i
were
a
swell
like
you
she
scoffed
it
would
take
a
heap
sight
more
than
a
drunken
man
munching
pansies
and
rum
and
to
to
jolt
me
out
of
my
limousines
and
steam
yachts
and
adirondack
bungalows
quite
against
all
intention
helene
churchill
laughed
she
did
not
often
laugh
just
for
an
instant
her
eyes
and
zillah
forsyth
clashed
together
in
the
irremediable
antagonism
of
caste
the
scornful
impatience
with
the
aristocrat
equaled
only
by
the
aristocrat
condescending
patience
with
the
plebeian
it
was
no
more
than
right
that
the
aristocrat
should
recover
her
first
never
mind
about
your
understanding
zillah
dear
she
said
softly
your
hair
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
along
zillah
forsyth
ivory
cheek
an
incongruous
little
flush
of
red
began
to
show
with
much
more
nonchalance
than
was
really
necessary
she
pointed
towards
her
trunk
it
was
sunday
school
i
was
coming
home
from
when
i
got
my
motto
she
remarked
dryly
with
a
wink
at
no
one
in
particular
and
so
far
as
i
know
she
proceeded
with
increasing
sarcasm
the
man
who
inspired
my
noble
life
was
not
in
any
way
particularly
addicted
to
the
use
of
alcoholic
beverages
as
though
her
collar
was
suddenly
too
tight
she
rammed
her
finger
down
between
her
stiff
white
and
her
soft
white
throat
he
was
a
new
york
doctor
she
hastened
somewhat
airily
to
explain
gee
but
he
was
a
swell
and
he
was
spending
his
summer
holiday
up
in
the
same
maine
town
where
i
was
tending
soda
fountain
and
he
used
to
drop
into
the
nights
after
cigars
and
things
and
he
used
to
tell
me
stories
about
the
drugs
and
things
sitting
up
there
on
the
counter
swinging
his
legs
and
pointing
out
this
and
that
quinine
ipecac
opium
hasheesh
all
the
silly
patent
medicines
every
sloppy
soothing
syrup
lordy
he
knew
as
though
they
were
people
where
they
come
from
where
they
going
to
yarns
about
the
tropics
that
would
kink
the
hair
along
the
nape
of
your
neck
jokes
about
your
own
town
pharmacology
that
would
make
you
yell
for
joy
gee
but
the
things
that
man
had
seen
and
known
gee
but
the
things
that
man
could
make
you
see
and
know
and
he
had
an
automobile
she
confided
proudly
it
was
one
of
those
billion
dollar
french
cars
and
i
lived
just
round
the
corner
from
the
but
we
used
to
ride
home
by
way
of
new
hampshire
almost
imperceptibly
her
breath
began
to
quicken
gee
those
nights
she
muttered
rain
or
shine
moon
or
thunder
tearing
down
those
country
roads
at
forty
miles
an
hour
singing
hollering
whispering
it
was
him
that
taught
me
to
do
my
hair
like
this
instead
of
all
the
cheap
rats
and
pompadours
every
other
kid
in
town
was
wearing
she
asserted
quite
irrelevantly
then
stopped
with
a
quick
furtive
glance
of
suspicion
towards
both
her
listeners
and
mouthed
her
way
delicately
back
to
the
beginning
of
her
sentence
again
it
was
that
taught
me
to
do
my
hair
like
this
she
repeated
with
the
faintest
possible
suggestion
of
hauteur
for
one
reason
or
another
along
the
exquisitely
chaste
curve
of
her
cheek
a
narrow
streak
of
red
began
to
show
again
and
he
went
away
very
sudden
at
the
last
she
finished
hurriedly
it
seems
he
was
married
all
the
time
blandly
she
turned
her
wonderful
face
to
the
caressing
light
and
i
hope
he
goes
to
hell
she
added
perfectly
simply
with
a
little
gasp
of
astonishment
shock
suspicion
distaste
helene
churchill
reached
out
an
immediate
conscientious
hand
to
her
oh
zillah
she
began
oh
poor
zillah
dear
i
so
sorry
i
so
absolutely
serenely
through
a
mask
of
insolence
and
ice
zillah
forsyth
ignored
the
proffered
hand
i
do
know
what
particular
call
you
got
to
be
sorry
for
me
helene
churchill
she
drawled
languidly
i
got
my
character
same
as
you
got
yours
and
just
about
nine
times
as
many
good
looks
and
when
it
comes
to
nursing
like
an
alto
song
pierced
suddenly
by
one
shrill
treble
note
the
girl
immobile
face
sharpened
transiently
with
a
single
jagged
flash
of
emotion
and
when
it
comes
to
nursing
ha
helene
churchill
you
can
lead
your
class
all
you
want
to
with
your
manners
and
your
but
when
genteel
people
like
you
are
moping
round
all
ready
to
fold
your
patients
hands
on
their
breasts
and
murmur
will
be
done
why
that
the
time
that
little
truly
is
just
beginning
to
roll
up
her
sleeves
and
get
to
work
with
real
passion
her
slender
fingers
went
clutching
again
at
her
harsh
linen
collar
it
is
you
helene
churchill
she
taunted
ever
been
to
the
superintendent
on
your
bended
knees
and
begged
for
the
rabies
cases
and
the
gee
you
like
nursing
because
you
think
it
pious
to
like
it
but
i
like
it
i
like
it
from
brow
to
chin
as
though
fairly
stricken
with
sincerity
her
whole
bland
face
furrowed
startlingly
with
crude
expressiveness
the
smell
of
ether
she
stammered
it
like
wine
to
me
the
clang
of
the
ambulance
gong
i
rather
hear
it
than
i
crawl
on
my
hands
and
knees
a
hundred
miles
to
watch
a
major
operation
i
wish
there
was
a
war
i
give
my
life
to
see
a
cholera
epidemic
abruptly
as
it
came
the
passion
faded
from
her
face
leaving
every
feature
tranquil
again
demure
exaggeratedly
innocent
with
saccharine
sweetness
she
turned
to
rae
malgregor
now
little
one
she
mocked
tell
us
the
story
of
your
lovely
life
having
heard
me
coyly
confess
that
i
went
into
nursing
because
i
had
such
a
crush
on
this
world
and
helene
here
brazenly
affirm
that
she
went
into
nursing
because
she
had
such
a
crush
on
the
world
to
come
it
up
to
you
now
to
confide
to
us
just
how
you
happened
to
take
up
so
noble
an
endeavor
had
you
seen
some
of
the
young
house
beautiful
smiling
faces
depicted
in
the
hospital
catalogue
or
was
it
for
the
sake
of
the
senior
surgeon
grim
gray
mug
that
you
jilted
your
poor
lover
way
up
in
the
annapolis
valley
why
zillah
gasped
the
country
girl
why
i
think
you
perfectly
awful
why
zillah
forsyth
do
you
ever
say
a
thing
like
that
again
you
can
joke
all
you
want
to
about
the
flirty
young
internes
nothing
but
fellows
but
it
is
it
is
respectful
for
you
to
talk
like
that
about
the
senior
surgeon
he
too
too
terrifying
she
finished
in
an
utter
panic
of
consternation
oh
now
i
know
it
was
the
senior
surgeon
that
made
you
jilt
your
country
beau
taunted
zillah
forsyth
with
soft
alto
sarcasm
i
did
either
jilt
joe
hazeltine
stormed
rae
malgregor
explosively
backed
up
against
her
bureau
eyes
flaming
breast
heaving
little
cap
all
tossed
askew
over
her
left
ear
she
stood
defying
her
tormentor
i
did
either
jilt
joe
hazeltine
she
reasserted
passionately
it
was
joe
hazeltine
that
jilted
me
and
we
been
going
together
since
we
were
kids
and
now
he
married
the
dominie
daughter
and
they
got
a
kid
of
their
own
most
as
old
as
he
and
i
were
when
we
first
began
courting
each
other
and
it
all
because
i
insisted
on
being
a
trained
nurse
she
finished
shrilly
with
an
expression
of
real
shock
helene
churchill
peered
up
from
her
lowly
seat
on
the
floor
you
mean
she
asked
a
bit
breathlessly
you
mean
that
he
did
want
you
to
be
a
trained
nurse
you
mean
that
he
was
big
enough
fine
enough
to
appreciate
the
nobility
of
the
profession
nobility
nothing
snapped
rae
malgregor
it
was
me
scrubbing
strange
men
with
alcohol
that
he
could
stand
for
and
i
do
know
as
i
exactly
blame
him
she
added
huskily
it
certainly
is
a
good
deal
of
a
liberty
when
you
stop
to
think
about
it
quite
incongruously
her
big
childish
blue
eyes
narrowed
suddenly
into
two
dark
calculating
slits
it
comic
she
mused
how
there
is
a
man
in
the
world
who
would
stand
letting
his
wife
or
daughter
or
sister
have
a
male
nurse
but
look
at
the
jobs
we
girls
get
sent
out
on
very
confusing
with
sincere
appeal
she
turned
to
zillah
forsyth
and
yet
and
yet
she
stammered
and
yet
when
everything
scary
that
in
you
has
once
been
scared
out
of
you
why
there
nothing
left
in
you
to
be
scared
any
more
is
there
what
what
pleaded
helene
churchill
say
it
again
what
that
what
joe
and
i
quarreled
about
my
first
vacation
home
persisted
rae
malgregor
it
was
a
traveling
salesman
thigh
it
was
broken
bad
somebody
had
to
take
care
of
it
so
i
did
joe
thought
it
was
modest
to
be
so
willing
with
a
perplexed
sort
of
defiance
she
raised
her
square
little
chin
but
you
see
i
was
willing
she
said
i
was
perfectly
willing
just
one
single
solitary
year
of
hospital
training
had
made
me
perfectly
willing
and
you
ca
a
willing
even
to
please
your
beau
no
matter
how
hard
you
try
with
a
droll
admixture
of
shyness
and
disdain
she
tossed
her
curly
blonde
head
a
trifle
higher
shucks
she
attested
what
a
traveling
thigh
shucks
yourself
scoffed
zillah
forsyth
what
a
silly
beau
or
two
up
in
nova
scotia
to
a
girl
with
looks
like
you
you
could
have
married
that
typhoid
case
a
dozen
times
last
winter
if
you
crooked
your
little
finger
why
the
fellow
was
crazy
about
you
and
he
was
richer
than
croesus
what
queered
it
she
demanded
bluntly
did
his
mother
hate
you
like
one
fairly
cramped
with
astonishment
rae
malgregor
doubled
up
very
suddenly
at
the
and
thrusting
her
neck
oddly
forward
after
the
manner
of
a
startled
crane
stood
peering
sharply
round
the
corner
of
the
at
zillah
forsyth
did
his
mother
hate
me
she
gasped
did
his
mother
hate
me
well
what
do
you
think
with
me
who
never
even
saw
plumbing
till
i
came
down
here
setting
out
to
explain
to
her
with
twenty
tiled
bathrooms
how
to
be
hygienic
though
rich
did
his
mother
hate
me
well
what
do
you
think
with
her
who
bore
him
her
who
him
mind
you
kept
waiting
down
stairs
in
the
hospital
half
an
hour
every
day
on
the
raw
edge
of
a
rattan
chair
waiting
worrying
all
old
and
gray
and
scared
while
little
young
perky
pink
and
white
is
upstairs
brushing
her
own
son
hair
and
washing
her
own
face
and
altogether
getting
her
own
son
ready
to
see
his
own
mother
and
then
me
obliged
to
turn
her
out
again
in
ten
minutes
flip
as
you
please
for
fear
she
stayed
too
long
while
i
stay
on
the
rest
of
the
night
his
mother
hate
me
stealthily
as
an
assassin
she
crept
around
the
corner
of
the
and
grabbed
zillah
forsyth
by
her
astonished
linen
shoulder
did
his
mother
hate
me
she
persisted
mockingly
did
his
mother
hate
me
well
rather
is
there
any
woman
from
here
to
kamchatka
who
hate
us
is
there
any
woman
from
here
to
kamchatka
who
does
look
upon
a
trained
nurse
as
her
natural
born
enemy
i
do
blame
she
added
chokingly
look
at
the
impudent
jobs
we
get
sent
out
on
quarantined
upstairs
for
weeks
at
a
time
with
their
inflammable
diphtheritic
bridegrooms
while
they
sit
down
stairs
brooding
over
their
wedding
teaspoons
hiked
off
indefinitely
to
atlantic
city
with
their
gouty
bachelor
uncles
hearing
their
own
innocent
little
deathbed
deliriums
snatching
their
own
babies
away
from
their
breasts
and
showing
them
how
to
nurse
them
better
the
impudence
of
it
i
say
the
disgusting
confounded
impudence
doing
things
perfectly
flippantly
for
dollars
a
week
and
washing
that
all
the
achin
love
in
the
world
know
how
to
do
right
just
for
love
furiously
she
began
to
jerk
her
victim
shoulder
i
tell
you
awful
zillah
forsyth
she
insisted
i
tell
you
i
just
wo
stand
it
with
muscles
like
steel
wire
zillah
forsyth
scrambled
to
her
feet
and
pushed
rae
malgregor
back
against
the
bureau
for
heaven
sake
rae
shut
up
she
said
what
in
creation
the
matter
with
you
i
never
saw
you
act
so
before
with
real
concern
she
stared
into
the
girl
turbid
eyes
if
you
feel
like
that
about
it
what
in
thunder
did
you
go
into
nursing
for
she
demanded
not
unkindly
very
slowly
helene
churchill
rose
from
her
lowly
seat
by
her
precious
and
came
round
and
looked
at
rae
malgregor
rather
oddly
yes
faltered
helene
churchill
what
did
you
go
into
nursing
for
the
faintest
possible
taint
of
asperity
was
in
her
voice
quite
dumbly
for
an
instant
rae
malgregor
natural
timidity
stood
battling
the
almost
fanatic
professional
fervor
in
helene
frankly
open
face
the
raw
scientific
passion
of
very
different
caliber
but
no
less
intensity
hidden
so
craftily
behind
zillah
forsyth
plastic
features
then
suddenly
her
own
hands
went
clutching
back
at
the
bureau
for
support
and
all
the
flaming
raging
red
went
ebbing
out
of
her
cheeks
leaving
her
lips
with
hardly
blood
enough
left
to
work
them
i
went
into
nursing
she
mumbled
and
it
god
own
truth
i
went
into
nursing
because
because
i
thought
the
uniforms
were
so
cute
furiously
the
instant
the
words
were
gone
from
her
mouth
she
turned
and
snarled
at
zillah
hooting
laughter
well
i
had
to
do
something
she
attested
the
defense
was
like
a
flat
blade
slapping
the
air
desperately
she
turned
to
helene
churchill
goading
faintly
supercilious
smile
and
her
voice
edged
suddenly
like
a
twisted
sword
well
the
uniforms
cute
she
parried
they
are
they
are
i
bet
you
there
more
than
one
girl
standing
high
in
the
graduating
class
who
never
would
have
stuck
out
her
first
year
bossin
and
slops
and
worry
and
death
if
she
had
to
stick
it
out
in
the
unimportant
looking
clothes
she
came
from
home
in
even
you
helene
churchill
with
all
your
pious
talk
the
day
they
put
your
coachman
son
in
as
new
interne
and
you
got
called
down
from
the
office
for
failing
to
stand
when
young
coachman
came
into
the
room
you
bawled
all
night
you
did
and
swore
you
chuck
your
whole
job
and
go
home
the
next
day
if
it
was
that
you
just
had
a
photo
taken
in
full
nursing
costume
to
send
to
your
brother
chum
at
yale
so
there
with
a
gasp
of
ineffable
satisfaction
she
turned
from
helene
churchill
sure
the
uniforms
are
cute
she
slashed
back
at
zillah
forsyth
that
the
whole
trouble
with
they
so
awfully
masqueradishly
cute
sure
i
could
have
got
engaged
to
the
typhoid
boy
it
would
have
been
as
easy
as
robbing
a
babe
but
lots
of
girls
i
notice
get
engaged
in
their
uniforms
feeding
a
patient
perfectly
scientifically
out
of
his
own
silver
spoon
who
do
seem
to
stay
engaged
so
especially
long
in
their
own
street
clothes
bungling
just
plain
naturally
with
their
own
knives
and
forks
even
you
zillah
forsyth
she
hacked
even
you
who
trot
round
like
the
lord
anointed
in
your
pure
white
togs
you
just
as
dutchy
looking
as
anybody
else
come
to
put
you
in
a
red
hat
and
a
tan
coat
and
a
blue
skirt
mechanically
she
raised
her
hands
to
her
head
as
though
with
some
silly
thought
of
keeping
the
horrid
pain
in
her
temples
from
slipping
to
her
throat
her
breast
her
feet
sure
the
uniforms
are
cute
she
persisted
a
bit
thickly
sure
the
typhoid
boy
was
crazy
about
me
he
called
me
his
chorus
girl
i
heard
him
raving
in
his
sleep
lord
save
us
what
are
we
to
any
man
but
just
that
she
questioned
hotly
with
renewed
venom
parson
actor
young
sinner
old
saint
i
ask
you
frankly
girls
on
your
word
of
honor
was
there
ever
more
than
one
man
in
ten
went
through
your
hands
who
did
turn
out
soft
somewhere
before
you
were
through
with
him
mawking
about
your
eyes
while
you
wrecking
your
optic
nerves
trying
to
decipher
the
dose
on
a
poison
bottle
mooning
over
your
wonderful
likeness
to
the
lovely
young
sister
they
never
had
trying
to
kiss
your
finger
tips
when
you
struggling
to
brush
their
teeth
teasin
you
to
smoke
cigarettes
with
when
they
know
it
would
cost
you
your
job
impishly
without
any
warning
she
crooked
her
knee
and
pointed
at
one
homely
shoe
in
a
mincy
dancing
step
hoydenishly
she
threw
out
her
arms
and
tried
to
gather
helene
and
zillah
both
into
their
compass
oh
you
holy
chorus
girls
she
chuckled
with
maniacal
delight
everybody
all
together
now
kick
your
little
kicks
smile
your
little
smiles
tinkle
your
little
thermometers
steady
there
one
two
three
one
two
three
laughingly
zillah
forsyth
slipped
from
the
grasp
do
you
dare
me
she
threatened
in
real
irritation
helene
released
herself
i
no
chorus
girl
she
said
coldly
with
a
little
shrill
scream
of
pain
rae
malgregor
hands
went
flying
back
to
her
temples
like
a
person
giving
orders
in
a
great
panic
she
turned
authoritatively
to
her
two
her
fingers
all
the
while
boring
frenziedly
into
her
temples
now
girls
she
warned
stand
well
back
if
my
head
bursts
you
know
it
going
to
burst
all
to
slivers
and
splinters
like
a
boiler
rae
you
crazy
hooted
zillah
just
plain
vulgar
looney
faltered
helene
both
girls
reached
out
simultaneously
to
push
her
aside
somewhere
in
the
dusty
indifferent
street
a
bird
note
rang
out
in
one
wild
delirious
ecstasy
of
untrammeled
springtime
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
sound
might
have
been
the
one
final
signal
that
rae
malgregor
jangled
nerves
were
waiting
for
oh
i
crazy
am
i
she
cried
with
a
new
fierce
joy
oh
i
crazy
am
i
well
i
go
ask
the
superintendent
and
see
if
i
am
oh
surely
they
would
try
and
make
me
graduate
if
i
really
was
crazy
madly
she
bolted
for
her
bureau
and
snatching
her
own
motto
down
crumpled
its
face
securely
against
her
skirt
and
started
for
the
door
just
what
the
motto
was
no
one
but
herself
knew
sprawling
in
hieroglyphics
on
a
great
flapping
sheet
of
brown
the
sentiment
whatever
it
was
had
been
nailed
face
down
to
the
wall
for
three
tantalizing
years
no
you
do
cried
zillah
now
as
she
saw
the
mystery
threatening
so
meanly
to
escape
her
no
you
do
cried
helene
you
seen
our
mottoes
and
now
going
to
see
yours
almost
crazed
with
new
terror
rae
malgregor
went
dodging
to
the
right
to
the
left
to
the
right
again
cleared
the
a
scuffle
with
padded
hands
climbed
the
trunk
a
race
with
padded
feet
reached
the
at
last
yanked
the
door
open
and
with
lungs
and
temper
fairly
bursting
with
momentum
shot
down
the
hall
down
some
stairs
down
some
more
hall
down
some
more
stairs
to
the
superintendent
office
where
with
her
precious
motto
still
clutched
securely
in
one
hand
she
broke
upon
that
dignitary
startled
vision
like
a
young
of
linen
and
starch
and
flapping
brown
paper
breathlessly
without
prelude
or
preamble
she
hurled
her
grievance
into
the
older
woman
ears
give
me
back
my
own
face
she
demanded
peremptorily
give
me
back
my
own
face
i
say
and
my
own
hands
i
tell
you
i
want
my
own
hands
helene
and
zillah
say
i
insane
and
i
want
to
go
home
chapter
iii
like
a
animal
elongated
suddenly
to
the
cervical
proportions
of
a
giraffe
the
superintendent
of
nurses
reared
up
from
her
and
stared
forth
in
speechless
astonishment
across
the
top
of
her
spectacles
exuberantly
impertinent
ecstatically
rae
malgregor
repeated
her
demand
to
her
parched
mouth
the
very
taste
of
her
own
babbling
impudence
refreshed
her
like
the
shock
and
prickle
of
cracked
ice
i
tell
you
i
want
my
own
face
again
and
my
own
hands
she
reiterated
glibly
i
mean
the
face
with
the
mortgage
in
it
and
the
cinders
and
the
other
human
expressions
she
explained
and
the
nice
grubby
country
hands
that
go
with
that
sort
of
a
face
very
accusingly
she
raised
her
finger
and
shook
it
at
the
superintendent
perfectly
livid
countenance
oh
of
course
i
know
i
was
very
much
to
look
at
but
at
least
i
matched
what
my
hands
knew
i
mean
my
face
knew
pies
or
plowing
or
what
my
hands
knew
my
face
knew
that
the
way
hands
and
faces
ought
to
work
together
but
you
you
with
all
your
rules
and
your
bossing
and
your
everlasting
sh
s
sh
you
snubbed
all
the
out
of
my
face
and
made
my
hands
nothing
but
two
disconnected
machines
for
somebody
else
to
run
and
i
hate
you
a
monster
you
a
everybody
hates
you
mutely
then
she
shut
her
eyes
bowed
her
head
and
waited
for
the
superintendent
to
smite
her
dead
the
smite
she
felt
quite
sure
would
be
a
noisy
one
first
of
all
she
reasoned
it
would
fracture
her
skull
naturally
then
of
course
it
would
splinter
her
spine
later
in
all
probability
it
would
telescope
her
and
never
indeed
now
that
she
came
to
think
of
it
had
the
arches
of
her
feet
felt
less
capable
of
resisting
so
terrible
an
impact
quite
unconsciously
she
groped
out
a
little
with
one
hand
to
steady
herself
against
the
edge
of
the
desk
but
the
blow
when
it
came
was
nothing
but
a
cool
finger
tapping
her
pulse
there
there
crooned
the
superintendent
voice
with
a
most
amazing
tolerance
but
i
wo
there
snapped
rae
malgregor
her
eyes
were
wide
open
again
now
and
extravagantly
dilated
the
cool
fingers
on
her
pulse
seemed
to
tighten
a
little
s
sh
s
sh
admonished
the
superintendent
mumbling
lips
but
i
wo
sh
s
sh
stormed
rae
malgregor
never
before
in
her
three
years
hospital
training
had
she
seen
her
the
superintendent
so
utterly
disarmed
of
irascible
temper
and
arrogant
dignity
and
the
sight
perplexed
and
maddened
her
at
one
and
the
same
moment
but
i
wo
sh
s
sh
desperately
she
jerked
her
curly
blonde
head
in
the
direction
of
the
clock
on
the
wall
here
it
four
now
she
cried
and
in
less
than
four
hours
you
going
to
try
and
make
me
graduate
and
go
out
into
the
world
god
knows
where
and
charge
innocent
people
dollars
a
week
and
washing
likelier
than
not
mind
you
for
these
hands
she
gestured
that
do
at
all
with
this
face
she
grimaced
but
with
the
face
of
one
of
the
house
doctors
or
the
senior
surgeon
or
even
you
who
may
be
way
off
in
kamchatka
when
i
need
him
most
she
finished
with
a
confused
jumble
of
accusation
and
despair
still
with
unexplainable
amiability
the
superintendent
whirled
back
into
place
in
her
and
with
her
left
hand
which
had
all
this
time
been
rummaging
busily
in
a
lower
desk
drawer
proffered
rae
malgregor
a
small
fold
of
paper
here
my
dear
she
said
here
a
sedative
for
you
take
it
at
once
it
will
quiet
you
perfectly
we
all
know
you
had
very
hard
luck
this
past
month
but
you
must
worry
so
about
the
future
the
slightest
possible
tinge
of
purely
professional
manner
crept
back
into
the
older
woman
voice
certainly
miss
malgregor
with
your
judgment
with
my
judgment
cried
rae
malgregor
the
phrase
was
like
a
red
rag
to
her
with
my
judgment
great
heavens
that
the
whole
trouble
i
have
got
any
judgment
i
never
been
allowed
to
have
any
judgment
all
i
ever
been
allowed
to
have
is
the
judgment
of
some
flirty
young
medical
student
or
the
house
doctor
or
the
senior
surgeon
or
you
her
eyes
were
fairly
piteous
with
terror
do
you
see
that
my
face
does
know
anything
she
faltered
except
just
to
smile
and
smile
and
smile
and
say
sir
no
sir
yes
sir
from
curly
blonde
head
to
commonsense
shoes
her
little
body
began
to
quiver
suddenly
like
the
advent
of
a
chill
oh
what
am
i
going
to
do
she
begged
when
i
way
off
alone
somewhere
in
the
mountains
or
a
tenement
or
a
palace
and
something
happens
and
there
is
any
judgment
round
to
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
do
abruptly
in
the
doorway
as
though
summoned
by
some
purely
casual
flicker
of
the
superintendent
thin
fingers
another
nurse
appeared
yes
i
rang
said
the
superintendent
go
and
ask
the
senior
surgeon
if
he
can
come
to
me
here
a
moment
immediately
the
senior
surgeon
gasped
rae
malgregor
the
senior
surgeon
with
her
hands
clutching
at
her
throat
she
reeled
back
against
the
wall
for
support
like
a
shore
bereft
in
one
second
of
its
tide
like
a
tree
stripped
in
one
second
of
its
leafage
she
stood
there
utterly
stricken
of
temper
or
passion
or
any
animating
human
emotion
whatsoever
oh
now
i
going
to
be
expelled
oh
now
i
know
i
going
to
be
expelled
she
moaned
listlessly
very
vaguely
into
the
farthest
radiation
of
her
vision
she
sensed
the
approach
of
a
man
grayly
dogmatic
as
a
block
of
granite
the
senior
surgeon
loomed
up
at
last
in
the
doorway
i
in
a
hurry
he
growled
what
the
matter
precipitously
rae
malgregor
collapsed
into
the
breach
oh
there
nothing
at
all
the
matter
sir
she
stammered
only
it
only
that
i
just
decided
that
i
do
want
to
be
a
trained
nurse
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
the
superintendent
shrugged
the
absurd
speech
aside
faber
she
said
wo
you
just
please
assure
miss
malgregor
once
more
that
the
little
italian
boy
death
last
week
was
in
no
conceivable
way
her
fault
that
nobody
blames
her
in
the
slightest
or
holds
her
in
any
possible
way
responsible
why
what
nonsense
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
what
and
the
portuguese
woman
the
week
before
that
interrupted
rae
malgregor
dully
stuff
and
nonsense
said
the
senior
surgeon
it
nothing
but
coincidence
pure
coincidence
it
might
have
happened
to
anybody
and
she
has
slept
for
almost
a
fortnight
the
superintendent
confided
nor
touched
a
drop
of
food
or
drink
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
except
just
black
coffee
i
been
expecting
this
for
some
days
rae
malgregor
resumed
with
monotony
brusquely
the
senior
surgeon
stepped
forward
and
taking
the
girl
by
her
shoulders
jerked
her
sharply
round
to
the
light
and
with
firm
authoritative
fingers
rolled
one
of
her
eyelids
deftly
back
from
its
inordinately
dilated
pupil
equally
brusquely
he
turned
away
again
nothing
but
moonshine
he
muttered
nothing
in
the
world
but
too
much
coffee
dope
taken
on
an
empty
stomach
brain
i
better
have
said
when
will
you
girls
ever
learn
any
sense
with
searchlight
shrewdness
his
eyes
flashed
back
for
an
instant
over
the
haggard
gray
lines
that
slashed
along
the
corners
of
her
quivering
childish
mouth
a
bit
temperishly
he
began
to
put
on
his
gloves
next
time
you
set
out
to
have
a
miss
malgregor
he
suggested
satirically
try
to
have
it
about
something
more
sensible
than
imagining
that
anybody
is
trying
to
hold
you
personally
responsible
for
the
existence
of
death
in
the
world
bah
he
ejaculated
fiercely
if
you
are
going
to
fuss
like
this
over
cases
hopelessly
moribund
from
the
start
what
in
thunder
are
you
going
to
do
some
fine
day
when
out
of
a
perfectly
clear
and
clean
sky
security
itself
turns
septic
and
you
lose
the
president
of
the
united
states
or
a
mother
of
nine
children
with
a
but
i
was
fussing
sir
protested
rae
malgregor
with
a
timid
sort
of
dignity
why
it
never
had
occurred
to
me
for
a
moment
that
anybody
blamed
me
for
anything
just
from
sheer
astonishment
her
hands
took
a
new
clutch
into
the
torn
flapping
corner
of
the
motto
that
she
still
clung
desperately
to
even
at
this
moment
for
heaven
sake
stop
crackling
that
brown
paper
stormed
the
senior
surgeon
but
i
was
crackling
the
brown
paper
sir
it
crackling
itself
persisted
rae
malgregor
very
softly
the
great
blue
eyes
that
lifted
to
his
were
brimming
full
of
misery
oh
ca
i
make
you
understand
sir
she
stammered
appealingly
she
turned
to
the
superintendent
oh
ca
i
make
anybody
understand
all
i
was
trying
to
say
all
i
was
trying
to
explain
was
that
i
want
to
be
a
trained
nurse
after
why
not
demanded
the
senior
surgeon
with
a
rather
noisy
click
of
his
glove
fasteners
because
my
face
is
tired
said
the
girl
quite
simply
the
explosive
wrath
on
the
senior
surgeon
countenance
seemed
to
be
directed
suddenly
at
the
superintendent
is
this
an
afternoon
tea
he
asked
tartly
with
six
major
operations
this
morning
and
a
probable
meningitis
diagnosis
ahead
of
me
this
afternoon
i
think
i
might
be
spared
the
babblings
of
an
hysterical
nurse
casually
over
his
shoulder
he
nodded
at
the
girl
you
a
fool
he
said
and
started
for
the
door
just
on
the
threshold
he
turned
abruptly
and
looked
back
his
forehead
was
furrowed
like
a
corduroy
road
and
the
one
rampant
question
in
his
mind
at
the
moment
seemed
to
be
mired
hopelessly
between
his
bushy
eyebrows
lord
he
exclaimed
a
bit
flounderingly
are
the
nurse
that
helped
me
last
week
on
that
fractured
skull
yes
sir
said
rae
malgregor
jerkily
the
senior
surgeon
retraced
his
footsteps
into
the
office
and
stood
facing
her
as
though
with
some
really
terrible
accusation
and
the
freak
abdominal
he
quizzed
sharply
was
it
who
threaded
that
needle
for
me
so
blamed
slowly
and
calmly
and
surely
while
all
the
rest
of
us
were
jumping
up
and
down
and
cursing
you
for
no
brighter
reason
than
that
we
could
have
threaded
it
ourselves
if
we
had
all
eternity
before
us
and
all
creation
bleeding
to
death
sir
said
rae
malgregor
quite
bluntly
the
senior
surgeon
reached
out
and
lifted
one
of
her
hands
to
his
scowling
professional
scrutiny
gad
he
attested
what
a
hand
you
a
wonder
under
proper
direction
you
a
wonder
it
was
like
myself
working
with
twenty
fingers
and
no
thumbs
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
almost
boyishly
the
embarrassed
flush
mounted
to
his
cheeks
as
he
jerked
away
again
excuse
me
for
not
recognizing
you
he
apologized
gruffly
but
you
girls
all
look
so
much
alike
as
though
the
eloquence
of
heaven
itself
had
suddenly
descended
upon
a
person
hitherto
hopelessly
rae
malgregor
lifted
an
utterly
transfigured
face
to
the
senior
surgeon
grimly
astonished
gaze
yes
yes
sir
she
cried
joyously
that
just
exactly
what
the
trouble
is
that
just
exactly
what
i
was
trying
to
express
sir
my
face
is
all
worn
out
trying
to
alike
my
cheeks
are
almost
sprung
with
artificial
smiles
my
eyes
are
fairly
bulging
with
unshed
tears
my
nose
aches
like
a
toothache
trying
never
to
turn
up
at
anything
smothered
with
the
discipline
of
it
i
choked
with
the
affectation
i
tell
you
i
just
ca
breathe
through
a
trained
nurse
face
any
more
i
tell
you
sir
i
sick
to
death
of
being
nothing
but
a
type
i
want
to
look
like
i
want
to
see
what
life
could
do
to
a
silly
face
like
mine
if
it
ever
got
a
chance
when
other
women
are
crying
i
want
the
fun
of
crying
when
other
women
look
scared
to
death
i
want
the
fun
of
looking
scared
to
death
hysterically
again
with
shrewish
emphasis
she
began
to
repeat
i
wo
be
a
nurse
i
tell
you
i
wo
i
pray
what
brought
you
so
suddenly
to
this
remarkable
decision
scoffed
the
senior
surgeon
a
letter
from
my
father
sir
she
confided
more
quietly
a
letter
about
some
dogs
dogs
hooted
the
senior
surgeon
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
a
trifle
speculatively
for
an
instant
she
glanced
at
the
superintendent
face
and
then
back
again
to
the
senior
surgeon
yes
sir
she
repeated
with
increasing
confidence
up
in
nova
scotia
my
father
raises
oh
no
special
fancy
kind
sir
she
hastened
in
all
honesty
to
explain
just
dogs
you
know
just
mixed
dogs
pointers
with
curly
tails
and
hounds
and
brindled
spaniels
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
just
mongrels
you
know
but
very
clever
and
people
sir
come
all
the
way
from
boston
to
buy
dogs
of
him
and
once
a
man
came
way
from
london
to
learn
the
secret
of
his
training
well
what
is
the
secret
of
his
training
quizzed
the
senior
surgeon
with
the
sudden
eager
interest
of
a
sportsman
i
should
think
it
would
be
pretty
hard
he
acknowledged
in
a
mixed
gang
like
that
to
decide
just
which
particular
dog
was
suited
to
what
particular
game
yes
that
just
it
sir
beamed
the
white
linen
nurse
a
dog
of
course
will
chase
anything
that
runs
that
just
dog
but
when
a
dog
really
begins
to
for
what
he
chasing
he
wags
that
hunting
father
does
calculate
he
says
on
training
a
dog
on
anything
he
does
wag
on
yes
but
what
that
got
to
do
with
you
asked
the
senior
surgeon
a
bit
impatiently
with
dismay
the
white
linen
nurse
stood
staring
blankly
at
the
senior
surgeon
gross
stupidity
why
do
you
see
she
faltered
i
been
chasing
this
nursing
job
three
whole
years
now
and
there
no
wag
to
it
oh
hell
said
the
senior
surgeon
if
he
had
said
oh
hell
he
would
have
grinned
and
it
had
been
a
grinning
day
and
he
certainly
did
intend
to
begin
grinning
at
any
such
late
hour
as
that
in
the
afternoon
with
his
dignity
once
reassured
he
relaxed
then
a
trifle
for
heaven
sake
what
you
want
to
be
he
asked
not
unkindly
with
an
abrupt
effort
at
rae
malgregor
jerked
her
head
into
at
least
the
outer
semblance
of
a
person
lost
in
almost
fathomless
thought
why
i
sure
i
do
know
sir
she
acknowledged
worriedly
but
it
would
be
a
great
pity
i
suppose
to
waste
all
the
grand
training
gone
into
my
hands
with
sudden
conviction
her
limp
shoulders
stiffened
a
trifle
my
oldest
sister
she
stammered
bosses
the
laundry
in
one
of
the
big
hotels
in
halifax
and
my
youngest
sister
teaches
school
in
moncton
but
i
so
strong
you
know
and
i
like
to
move
things
round
so
and
everything
maybe
i
could
get
a
position
somewhere
as
general
housework
girl
with
a
roar
of
amusement
as
astonishing
to
himself
as
to
his
listeners
the
senior
surgeon
chin
jerked
suddenly
upward
you
crazy
as
a
loon
he
confided
cordially
great
scott
if
you
can
work
up
a
condition
like
this
on
coffee
what
would
you
do
on
he
hesitated
grimly
malted
milk
as
unheralded
as
his
amusement
gross
irritability
overtook
him
again
will
you
stop
rattling
that
brown
paper
he
thundered
at
her
innocently
as
a
child
she
rebuffed
the
accusation
and
ignored
the
temper
but
i
not
rattling
it
sir
she
protested
i
simply
trying
to
hide
what
on
the
other
side
of
it
what
is
on
the
other
side
of
it
demanded
the
senior
surgeon
bluntly
with
unquestioning
docility
the
girl
turned
the
paper
around
from
behind
her
desk
the
austere
superintendent
twisted
her
neck
most
informally
to
decipher
the
scrawling
hieroglyphics
ever
she
read
forth
jerkily
with
a
questioning
incredulous
sort
of
emphasis
do
ever
be
bumptious
squinted
the
senior
surgeon
perplexedly
through
his
glasses
yes
said
rae
malgregor
very
timidly
it
my
motto
your
motto
sniffed
the
superintendent
your
motto
chuckled
the
senior
surgeon
yes
my
motto
repeated
rae
malgregor
with
the
slightest
perceptible
tinge
of
resentment
and
it
a
perfectly
good
motto
too
only
of
course
it
has
got
any
style
to
it
that
why
i
did
want
the
girls
to
see
it
she
confided
a
bit
drearily
then
palpably
before
their
eyes
they
saw
her
spirit
leap
into
ineffable
pride
my
father
gave
it
to
me
she
announced
briskly
and
my
father
said
that
when
i
came
home
in
june
if
i
could
honestly
say
that
i
never
once
been
bumptious
all
my
three
years
here
he
give
me
a
heifer
and
well
i
guess
you
lost
your
heifer
said
the
senior
surgeon
bluntly
lost
my
heifer
gasped
the
girl
and
incredulous
she
stood
for
an
instant
staring
back
and
forth
from
the
superintendent
face
to
the
senior
surgeon
you
mean
she
stammered
you
mean
that
i
been
bumptious
just
now
you
mean
that
after
all
these
years
of
meachin
meekness
i
lost
plainly
even
to
the
senior
surgeon
and
the
superintendent
the
bones
in
her
knees
weakened
suddenly
like
knots
of
tissue
paper
no
power
on
earth
could
have
made
her
break
discipline
by
taking
a
chair
while
the
senior
surgeon
stood
so
she
sank
limply
down
to
the
floor
instead
with
two
great
solemn
tears
welling
slowly
through
the
fingers
with
which
she
tried
vainly
to
cover
her
face
and
the
heifer
was
brown
with
one
white
ear
it
was
awful
cunning
she
confided
mumblingly
and
it
ate
from
my
hand
all
warm
and
sticky
like
loving
sandpaper
there
was
no
protest
in
her
voice
nor
any
whine
of
complaint
but
merely
the
abject
submission
to
fate
of
one
who
from
earliest
infancy
had
seen
other
crops
blighted
by
other
frosts
then
tremulously
with
the
air
of
one
who
just
as
a
matter
of
spiritual
tidiness
would
purge
her
soul
of
all
sad
secrets
she
lifted
her
entrancing
face
from
her
strong
sturdy
utterly
unemotional
fingers
and
stared
with
amazing
blueness
amazing
blandness
into
the
senior
surgeon
scowling
scrutiny
and
i
named
her
for
you
she
said
i
named
her
patience
for
you
instantly
then
she
scrambled
to
her
knees
to
try
and
assuage
by
some
miraculous
apology
the
horrible
shock
which
she
read
in
the
senior
surgeon
face
oh
of
course
sir
i
know
it
is
scientific
she
pleaded
desperately
oh
of
course
sir
i
know
it
is
scientific
at
all
but
up
where
i
live
you
know
instead
of
praying
for
anybody
we
we
name
a
young
animal
for
the
virtue
that
that
person
seems
to
need
the
most
and
if
you
tend
the
young
animal
carefully
and
train
it
right
why
it
just
a
superstition
of
course
but
oh
sir
she
floundered
hopelessly
the
virtue
you
needed
most
in
your
business
was
what
i
meant
oh
really
sir
i
never
thought
of
criticizing
your
character
gruffly
the
senior
surgeon
laughed
embarrassment
was
in
the
laugh
and
anger
and
a
fierce
fiery
sort
of
resentment
against
both
the
embarrassment
and
the
anger
but
no
possible
trace
of
amusement
impatiently
he
glanced
up
at
the
fast
speeding
clock
good
lord
he
exclaimed
i
an
hour
late
now
scowling
like
a
pirate
he
clicked
the
cover
of
his
watch
open
and
shut
for
an
uncertain
instant
then
suddenly
he
laughed
again
and
there
was
nothing
whatsoever
in
his
laugh
this
time
except
just
amusement
see
here
miss
bossy
tamer
he
said
if
the
superintendent
is
willing
go
get
your
hat
and
coat
and
i
take
you
out
on
that
meningitis
case
with
me
it
a
thirty
mile
run
if
it
a
block
and
i
guess
if
you
sit
on
the
front
seat
it
will
blow
the
cobwebs
out
of
your
brain
if
anything
will
he
finished
not
unkindly
like
a
white
hen
sensing
the
approach
of
some
utterly
unseen
danger
the
superintendent
seemed
to
bristle
suddenly
in
every
direction
it
a
bit
irregular
she
protested
in
her
most
even
tone
bah
so
are
some
of
the
most
useful
of
the
french
verbs
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
in
the
midst
of
authority
his
voice
could
be
inestimably
soft
and
reassuring
but
sometimes
on
the
brink
of
asserting
said
authority
he
had
a
tone
that
was
distinctly
unpleasant
oh
very
well
conceded
the
superintendent
with
some
waspishness
hazily
for
an
instant
rae
malgregor
stood
staring
into
the
superintendent
uncordial
face
i
i
apologize
she
faltered
but
i
do
even
know
what
i
said
it
just
blew
up
perfectly
coldly
and
perfectly
civilly
the
superintendent
received
the
overture
it
was
quite
evident
miss
malgregor
that
you
were
not
altogether
responsible
at
the
moment
she
conceded
in
common
justice
heavily
then
like
a
person
walking
in
her
sleep
the
girl
trailed
out
of
the
room
to
get
her
coat
and
hat
slamming
one
after
another
the
superintendent
drowned
the
sluggish
sound
of
her
retreating
footsteps
there
goes
my
best
nurse
she
said
grimly
my
very
best
nurse
oh
no
not
the
most
brilliant
one
i
did
mean
that
but
the
most
reliable
the
most
nearly
perfect
human
machine
that
it
has
ever
been
my
privilege
to
see
turned
out
the
one
girl
that
week
in
week
out
month
after
month
and
year
after
year
has
always
done
what
she
told
when
she
was
told
and
the
exact
way
she
was
told
without
questioning
anything
without
protesting
anything
without
supplementing
anything
with
some
disastrous
original
conviction
of
her
own
look
at
her
tragically
the
superintendent
rubbed
her
hand
across
her
worried
brow
coffee
you
said
it
was
she
asked
skeptically
are
there
any
special
antidotes
for
coffee
with
a
queer
little
quirk
to
his
mouth
the
gruff
senior
surgeon
jerked
his
glance
back
from
the
open
window
where
with
the
gleam
of
a
slim
ankle
the
frisky
young
spring
went
scurrying
through
the
what
that
you
asked
he
quizzed
sharply
any
antidotes
for
coffee
yes
dozens
of
them
but
none
for
spring
spring
sniffed
the
superintendent
a
little
shiveringly
she
reached
out
and
gathered
a
white
knitted
shawl
around
her
shoulders
spring
i
do
see
what
spring
got
to
do
with
rae
malgregor
or
any
other
young
outlaw
in
my
graduating
class
if
graduation
came
in
november
it
would
be
just
the
same
they
a
set
of
ingrates
every
one
of
them
vehemently
she
turned
aside
to
her
of
names
and
slapped
the
cards
through
one
by
one
without
finding
one
single
soothing
exception
yes
sir
a
set
of
ingrates
she
repeated
accusingly
spend
your
life
trying
to
teach
them
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
cram
ideas
into
those
that
have
got
any
and
yank
ideas
out
of
those
who
have
got
too
many
refine
them
toughen
them
scold
them
coax
them
everlastingly
drill
and
discipline
them
and
then
just
as
you
get
them
to
a
place
where
they
move
like
and
you
actually
believe
you
can
trust
them
then
graduation
day
comes
round
and
they
think
they
all
safe
and
every
single
individual
member
of
the
class
breaks
out
and
runs
with
the
one
deed
she
been
itching
to
do
every
day
the
past
three
years
why
this
very
morning
i
caught
the
president
of
the
senior
class
with
a
breakfast
tray
in
her
hands
stealing
the
cherry
out
of
her
patient
grape
fruit
and
three
of
the
girls
reported
for
duty
as
bold
as
brass
with
their
hair
frizzed
tight
as
a
nigger
doll
and
the
girl
who
going
into
a
convent
next
week
was
trying
on
the
derby
hat
as
i
came
up
from
lunch
and
now
now
the
voice
went
suddenly
a
little
hoarse
and
now
here
miss
malgregor
intriguing
to
get
an
automobile
ride
with
eh
cried
the
senior
surgeon
with
a
jump
what
is
this
an
insane
asylum
is
it
a
nervine
madly
he
started
for
the
door
order
a
ton
of
bromides
he
called
back
over
his
shoulder
order
a
of
them
saturate
the
whole
place
with
them
drown
the
whole
damned
place
half
way
down
the
lower
hall
all
his
nerves
on
edge
all
his
unwonted
boyish
impulsiveness
quenched
noxiously
like
a
candle
flame
he
met
and
passed
rae
malgregor
without
a
sign
of
recognition
god
how
i
hate
women
he
kept
mumbling
to
himself
as
he
struggled
clumsily
all
alone
into
the
torn
sleeve
lining
of
his
thousand
dollar
mink
coat
chapter
iv
like
a
coming
out
of
a
long
smoky
smothery
tunnel
into
the
light
the
white
linen
nurse
came
out
of
the
hospital
into
the
riotous
promise
of
the
young
april
afternoon
the
god
of
hysteria
had
certainly
not
deserted
her
in
all
the
full
effervescent
reaction
of
her
fairly
bubbling
with
dimples
fairly
foaming
with
curls
most
ecstatically
she
tripped
down
into
the
sunshine
as
though
the
great
harsh
granite
steps
that
marked
her
descent
were
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
gigantic
old
hand
passing
her
blithely
out
to
some
deliciously
unknown
lilliputian
adventure
as
she
pranced
across
the
soggy
april
sidewalk
to
what
she
supposed
was
the
senior
surgeon
perfectly
empty
automobile
she
became
conscious
suddenly
that
the
rear
seat
of
the
car
was
already
occupied
out
from
an
unseasonable
snuggle
of
sable
furs
and
flaming
red
hair
a
small
peevish
face
peered
forth
at
her
with
frank
curiosity
why
hello
beamed
the
white
linen
nurse
who
are
you
with
unmistakable
hostility
the
haughty
little
face
retreated
into
its
furs
and
its
red
hair
hush
commanded
a
shrill
childish
voice
hush
i
say
i
a
cripple
and
very
do
speak
to
me
oh
my
glory
gasped
the
white
linen
nurse
oh
my
glory
glory
glory
without
any
warning
whatsoever
she
felt
suddenly
like
rigged
out
in
an
exceedingly
shabby
old
ulster
and
an
excessively
homely
black
slouch
hat
in
a
desperate
attempt
at
tangible
nonchalance
she
tossed
her
head
and
thrust
her
hands
down
deep
into
her
big
ulster
pockets
that
the
bleak
hat
reflected
no
decent
featherish
consciousness
of
being
tossed
that
the
big
threadbare
pockets
had
no
bottoms
to
them
merely
completed
her
startled
sense
of
having
been
in
some
way
blotted
right
out
of
existence
behind
her
back
the
senior
surgeon
huge
approach
dawned
blissfully
like
the
thud
of
a
rescue
party
but
if
the
senior
surgeon
blunt
wholesome
invitation
to
ride
had
been
perfectly
sweet
when
he
prescribed
it
for
her
in
the
office
the
invitation
had
certainly
soured
most
amazingly
in
the
succeeding
ten
minutes
abruptly
now
without
any
greeting
he
reached
out
and
opened
the
rear
door
of
the
car
and
nodded
curtly
for
her
to
enter
there
instantly
across
the
face
of
the
little
crippled
girl
already
ensconced
in
the
tonneau
a
single
flash
of
light
went
crookedly
from
brow
to
chin
and
was
gone
again
hello
fat
father
piped
the
shrill
little
voice
hello
fat
father
yet
so
subtly
was
the
phrase
mouthed
to
save
your
soul
you
could
not
have
proved
just
where
the
greeting
ended
and
the
taunt
began
there
was
nothing
subtle
however
about
the
way
in
which
the
senior
surgeon
hand
shot
out
and
slammed
the
tonneau
door
again
on
its
original
passenger
his
face
was
crimson
with
anger
brusquely
he
pointed
to
the
front
seat
you
may
sit
in
there
with
me
miss
malgregor
he
thundered
yes
sir
crooned
the
white
linen
nurse
meek
as
an
oiled
machine
she
scuttled
to
her
appointed
place
once
more
in
smothered
giggle
and
unprotesting
acquiescence
she
sensed
the
resumption
of
eternal
discipline
already
in
just
this
trice
of
time
she
felt
her
rampant
young
mouth
resettle
tamely
into
lines
of
smug
determinate
serenity
already
across
her
idle
lap
she
felt
her
clasped
fingers
begin
to
frost
and
tingle
again
like
a
cheerfully
bunch
of
live
wires
waiting
the
one
authoritative
signal
to
connect
somebody
anybody
with
this
world
or
the
next
already
the
facile
tip
of
her
tongue
seemed
fairly
loaded
and
cocked
like
a
revolver
with
all
the
approximate
yes
sirs
no
sirs
that
she
thought
she
should
probably
need
but
the
only
immediate
remarks
that
the
senior
surgeon
addressed
to
any
one
were
addressed
distinctly
to
the
crank
of
his
automobile
damn
having
a
chauffeur
who
gets
drunk
the
one
day
of
the
year
when
you
need
him
most
he
muttered
under
his
breath
as
with
the
same
exquisitely
sensitive
fingers
that
could
have
dissected
like
a
caress
the
nervous
system
of
a
humming
bird
or
unbruisingly
the
broken
wing
of
a
butterfly
he
hurled
his
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
of
infuriate
against
the
calm
chronic
mechanical
stubbornness
of
that
auto
crank
damn
he
swore
on
the
upward
pull
damn
he
gasped
on
the
downward
push
damn
he
cursed
and
sputtered
and
spluttered
purple
with
effort
with
strain
reeking
with
sweat
his
frenzied
outburst
would
have
terrorized
the
entire
hospital
staff
with
an
odd
little
twinge
of
homesickness
the
white
linen
nurse
slid
cautiously
out
to
the
edge
of
her
seat
so
that
she
might
watch
the
struggle
better
for
thus
with
dripping
foreheads
and
knotted
and
breaking
backs
and
rankly
tempestuous
language
did
the
untutored
of
her
own
beloved
hurl
their
great
strength
against
bulls
and
boulders
and
refractory
forest
trees
very
startlingly
as
she
watched
a
brand
new
thought
went
through
her
consciousness
was
it
possible
was
it
even
so
much
as
remotely
possible
that
the
great
senior
surgeon
the
great
wonderful
altogether
formidable
altogether
unapproachable
senior
surgeon
was
just
a
was
just
a
stripped
ruthlessly
of
all
his
social
superiority
of
all
his
professional
halo
of
all
his
scientific
achievement
the
senior
surgeon
stood
suddenly
forth
before
her
a
mere
man
just
like
other
men
like
other
men
like
the
sick
like
the
millionaire
baby
like
the
doddering
old
dutch
gaffer
the
very
delicacy
of
such
a
thought
drove
the
blood
from
her
face
it
was
the
indelicacy
of
the
thought
that
brought
the
blood
surging
back
again
to
brow
to
cheeks
to
lips
even
to
the
tips
of
her
ears
glancing
up
casually
from
the
roar
and
rumble
of
his
abruptly
repentant
engine
the
senior
surgeon
swore
once
more
under
his
breath
to
think
that
any
female
sitting
perfectly
idle
and
in
a
seven
thousand
dollar
car
should
have
the
nerve
to
flaunt
such
a
furiously
strenuous
color
bristling
with
resentment
and
mink
furs
he
strode
around
the
fender
and
stumbled
with
increasing
irritation
across
the
white
linen
nurse
knees
to
his
seat
just
for
an
instant
his
famous
fingers
seemed
to
flash
with
apparent
inconsequence
towards
one
bit
of
mechanism
and
another
then
like
a
huge
portentous
pill
floated
on
smoothest
syrup
the
car
slid
down
the
yawning
street
into
the
congested
city
altogether
monotonously
in
terms
of
pain
and
dirt
and
drug
and
disease
the
city
wafted
itself
in
and
out
of
the
white
linen
consciousness
from
every
filthy
street
corner
sodden
age
or
starved
babyhood
reached
out
its
fluttering
pulse
to
her
then
suddenly
sweet
as
a
draught
through
a
room
the
squalid
city
freshened
into
jocund
luxuriant
suburbs
with
rollicking
tennis
courts
and
flaming
yellow
forsythia
blossoms
and
green
velvet
lawns
prematurely
posied
with
pale
exotic
hyacinths
and
great
scarlet
splotches
of
lusty
tulips
beyond
this
hectic
horticultural
outburst
the
leisurely
spring
faded
out
again
into
april
naturally
sallow
colors
glossy
and
black
as
an
endless
typewriter
ribbon
the
narrow
tense
state
road
seemed
to
wind
itself
everlastingly
in
and
in
and
in
on
some
hidden
spool
of
the
car
mysterious
mechanism
faster
than
any
human
mind
could
think
faster
than
any
human
hand
could
finger
hurtling
up
hazardous
hills
of
thought
sliding
down
facile
valleys
of
fancy
roaring
with
emphasis
shrieking
with
punctuation
the
great
car
yielded
itself
perforce
to
fate
dictation
robbed
successively
of
the
city
humanitarian
pang
of
the
esthetic
pleasure
the
white
linen
nurse
found
herself
precipitated
suddenly
into
a
mere
blur
of
sight
a
mere
chaos
of
sound
in
whizzing
speed
and
crashing
breeze
houses
fences
meadows
people
slapped
across
her
eyeballs
like
pictures
on
a
fan
on
and
on
and
on
through
kaleidoscopic
yellows
and
rushing
grays
the
great
car
sped
a
purely
mechanical
factor
in
a
purely
mechanical
landscape
rigid
with
concentration
the
senior
surgeon
stared
like
a
dead
man
into
the
intrepid
road
intermittently
from
her
green
plushy
laprobes
the
little
crippled
girl
struggled
to
her
feet
and
sprawling
clumsily
across
shoulder
suited
her
best
raised
a
brazenly
innocent
voice
deliberately
flatted
in
a
shrill
and
maddeningly
repetitive
chant
of
her
own
making
to
the
effect
that
all
the
birds
were
there
with
yellow
feathers
instead
of
hair
and
bumble
bees
crocheted
in
the
trees
and
bumble
bees
crocheted
in
the
trees
and
all
the
birds
were
there
and
and
intermittently
from
the
front
seat
the
senior
surgeon
wooden
face
relaxed
to
the
extent
of
a
grim
mouth
twisting
distractedly
sideways
in
one
furious
bellow
will
you
stop
your
and
go
back
to
your
seat
nothing
else
happened
at
all
until
at
last
out
of
unbroken
stretches
of
stubble
a
high
formal
hemlock
hedge
and
a
neat
pebbled
driveway
proclaimed
the
senior
surgeon
ultimate
destination
cautiously
now
with
an
almost
tender
skill
the
big
car
circled
a
tiny
venturesome
clump
of
highway
violets
and
crept
through
a
prancing
leaping
fluff
of
yellow
collie
dogs
to
the
door
of
the
big
stone
house
instantly
from
inestimable
resources
a
liveried
serving
man
appeared
to
help
the
surgeon
from
his
car
another
to
take
the
surgeon
coat
another
to
carry
his
bag
lingering
for
an
instant
to
stretch
his
muscles
and
shake
his
great
shoulders
the
senior
surgeon
breathed
into
his
cramped
lungs
a
friendly
impulse
as
well
as
a
scent
of
budding
cherry
trees
you
may
come
in
with
me
if
you
want
to
miss
malgregor
he
conceded
it
an
extraordinary
case
you
will
hardly
see
another
one
like
it
palpably
he
lowered
his
already
almost
indistinguishable
voice
the
boy
is
young
he
confided
about
your
age
i
should
guess
a
college
hero
the
most
superbly
perfect
specimen
of
young
manhood
it
has
ever
been
my
privilege
to
behold
it
will
be
a
long
case
they
have
two
nurses
already
but
would
like
another
the
work
ought
not
to
be
hard
now
if
they
should
happen
to
fancy
you
in
speechless
expressiveness
his
eyes
swept
estimatingly
over
stables
garages
italian
gardens
rapturous
mountain
views
every
last
intimate
detail
of
the
mansion
wonderful
equipment
like
a
drowning
man
feeling
his
last
floating
spar
wrenched
away
from
him
the
white
linen
nurse
dug
her
frantically
into
every
reachable
wrinkle
and
crevice
of
the
heavily
upholstered
seat
oh
but
sir
i
do
want
to
go
in
she
protested
passionately
i
tell
you
sir
i
quite
done
with
all
that
sort
of
thing
it
would
break
my
heart
it
would
oh
sir
this
worrying
about
people
for
whom
you
got
no
affection
it
like
sledding
without
any
snow
it
grits
right
down
on
your
naked
nerves
it
before
the
senior
surgeon
glowering
incredulous
stare
her
heart
began
to
plunge
and
pound
again
but
it
plunged
and
pounded
no
harder
she
realized
suddenly
than
when
in
the
calm
white
hospital
precincts
she
was
obliged
to
pass
his
terrifying
presence
in
the
corridor
and
murmur
an
inaudible
good
morning
or
good
evening
after
all
he
nothing
but
a
man
nothing
but
a
man
nothing
but
a
mere
ordinary
man
she
reasoned
over
and
over
to
herself
with
a
really
desperate
effort
she
smoothed
her
frightened
face
into
an
expression
of
utter
guilelessness
and
peace
and
smiled
unflinchingly
right
into
the
senior
surgeon
rousing
anger
as
she
had
once
seen
an
smile
into
the
snarl
of
a
crouching
tiger
th
ank
you
very
much
she
said
but
i
think
i
wo
go
in
sir
thank
you
my
my
face
is
still
pretty
tired
idiot
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
as
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
started
up
the
steps
from
the
green
plushy
robes
on
the
back
seat
the
white
linen
nurse
could
have
sworn
that
she
heard
a
sharply
ejaculated
maliciously
joyful
ha
piped
out
but
when
both
she
and
the
senior
surgeon
turned
sharply
round
to
make
sure
the
little
crippled
girl
in
apparently
complete
absorption
sat
amiably
extracting
tuft
after
tuft
of
fur
from
the
thumb
of
one
big
sable
glove
to
the
rumbling
monotone
of
he
loves
me
loves
me
not
loves
me
loves
me
not
bristling
with
unutterable
contempt
for
all
femininity
the
senior
surgeon
proceeded
up
the
steps
between
two
lackeys
father
wailed
a
feeble
little
voice
father
there
was
no
shrillness
in
the
tone
now
nor
malice
nor
any
mischievous
thing
just
desolation
the
impulsive
desolation
of
a
little
child
left
suddenly
alone
with
a
stranger
father
the
frightened
voice
ventured
forth
a
tiny
bit
louder
but
the
unheeding
senior
surgeon
had
already
reached
the
piazza
fat
father
screamed
the
little
voice
barbed
now
like
a
the
phrase
ripped
through
the
senior
surgeon
dormant
sensibilities
as
one
fairly
yanked
out
of
his
thoughts
he
whirled
around
in
his
tracks
what
do
you
want
he
thundered
helplessly
the
little
girl
sat
staring
from
a
lackey
grin
to
her
father
smoldering
fury
quite
palpably
she
began
to
swallow
with
considerable
difficulty
then
quick
as
a
flash
a
diminutively
crafty
smile
crooked
across
one
corner
of
her
mouth
father
she
improvised
dulcetly
father
may
may
i
sit
in
the
white
linen
nurse
lap
just
for
an
instant
the
senior
surgeon
narrowing
eyes
probed
mercilessly
into
the
reekingly
false
little
smile
then
altogether
brutally
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
do
care
where
in
blazes
you
sit
he
muttered
and
went
on
into
the
house
with
an
air
of
unalterable
finality
the
massive
oak
door
closed
after
him
in
the
resonant
click
of
its
latch
the
great
lock
seemed
to
smack
its
lips
with
ineffable
satisfaction
wringing
suddenly
round
with
a
whish
of
starched
skirts
the
white
linen
nurse
knelt
up
in
her
seat
and
grinned
at
the
little
crippled
girl
yourself
she
said
against
all
possible
expectancy
the
little
crippled
girl
burst
out
laughing
the
laugh
was
wild
ecstatic
extravagantly
boisterous
yet
awkward
withal
and
indescribably
bumpy
like
the
first
flight
of
a
bird
quite
abruptly
the
white
linen
nurse
sat
down
again
and
commenced
nervously
with
the
wrist
of
her
chamois
glove
to
polish
the
slightly
tarnished
brass
lamp
at
her
elbow
equally
abruptly
after
a
minute
she
stopped
polishing
and
looked
back
at
the
little
crippled
girl
would
you
like
to
sit
in
my
lap
she
queried
conscientiously
insolent
with
astonishment
the
little
girl
parried
the
question
why
in
blazes
should
i
want
to
sit
in
your
lap
she
quizzed
harshly
every
accent
of
her
voice
every
remotest
intonation
was
like
the
senior
surgeon
at
his
worst
the
suddenly
forked
eyebrow
the
snarling
twitch
of
the
upper
lip
turned
the
whole
delicate
little
face
into
a
grotesque
but
desperately
unconscious
caricature
of
the
father
as
though
the
father
himself
had
snubbed
her
for
some
unimaginable
familiarity
the
white
linen
nurse
winced
back
in
hopeless
confusion
just
for
sheer
shock
with
fatigue
a
big
tear
rolled
slowly
down
one
pink
cheek
instantly
to
the
edge
of
her
seat
the
little
girl
jerked
herself
forward
do
cry
pretty
she
whispered
do
cry
it
my
legs
i
got
fat
iron
braces
on
my
legs
and
people
do
like
to
hold
me
half
the
professional
smile
came
flashing
back
to
the
white
linen
nurse
mouth
oh
i
just
adore
holding
people
with
iron
braces
on
their
legs
she
affirmed
and
leaning
over
the
back
of
the
seat
proceeded
with
absolutely
perfect
mechanical
tenderness
to
gather
the
poor
puny
surprised
little
body
into
her
own
strong
shapely
arms
then
dutifully
snuggling
her
shoulder
to
meet
the
stubborn
little
shoulder
that
refused
to
snuggle
to
it
and
dutifully
easing
her
knees
to
suit
the
stubborn
little
knees
that
refused
to
be
eased
she
settled
down
resignedly
in
her
seat
again
to
await
the
return
of
the
senior
surgeon
there
there
there
she
began
quite
instinctively
to
croon
and
pat
do
say
there
wailed
the
little
girl
peevishly
her
body
was
suddenly
stiff
as
a
do
say
there
if
got
to
make
any
noise
at
all
say
here
here
here
droned
the
white
linen
nurse
here
here
here
here
on
and
on
and
interminably
on
here
here
here
here
at
the
end
of
about
the
here
the
little
girl
body
relaxed
and
she
reached
up
two
fragile
fingers
to
close
the
white
linen
nurse
mouth
there
that
will
do
she
sighed
contentedly
i
feel
better
now
father
does
tire
me
so
father
tires
gasped
the
white
linen
nurse
the
giggle
that
followed
the
gasp
was
not
in
the
remotest
degree
professional
father
tires
she
repeated
accusingly
why
you
silly
little
girl
ca
you
see
it
you
that
makes
father
so
everlastingly
tired
impulsively
with
her
one
free
hand
she
turned
the
little
girl
listless
face
to
the
light
what
makes
you
call
your
nice
father
father
she
asked
with
real
curiosity
what
makes
you
he
is
fat
at
all
he
just
big
why
what
ever
possesses
you
to
call
him
father
i
say
ca
you
see
how
mad
it
makes
him
why
of
course
it
made
him
mad
said
the
little
girl
with
plainly
reviving
interest
thrilled
with
astonishment
at
the
white
linen
apparent
stupidity
she
straightened
up
perkily
with
inordinately
sparkling
eyes
why
of
course
it
makes
him
mad
she
explained
briskly
that
why
i
do
it
why
my
parpa
never
even
looks
at
me
unless
i
make
him
mad
s
sh
said
the
white
linen
nurse
why
you
must
ever
say
a
thing
like
that
why
your
marma
would
like
you
to
say
a
thing
like
that
jerking
bumpily
back
against
the
white
linen
nurse
unprepared
shoulder
the
little
girl
prodded
a
pallid
into
the
white
linen
vivid
cheek
silly
pink
and
white
nursie
she
chuckled
do
you
know
there
any
marma
cackling
with
delight
over
her
own
superior
knowledge
she
folded
her
little
arms
and
began
to
rock
herself
convulsively
to
and
fro
why
stop
cried
the
white
linen
nurse
now
you
stop
why
you
wicked
little
creature
laughing
like
that
about
your
poor
dead
mother
why
just
think
how
bad
it
would
make
your
poor
parpa
feel
with
instant
sobriety
the
little
girl
stopped
rocking
and
stared
perplexedly
into
the
white
linen
nurse
shocked
eyes
her
own
little
face
was
all
wrinkled
up
with
earnestness
but
the
parpa
did
like
the
marma
she
explained
painstakingly
the
parpa
liked
the
marma
that
why
he
does
like
me
i
heard
cook
telling
the
ice
man
once
when
i
was
more
than
ten
minutes
old
desperately
with
one
straining
hand
the
white
linen
nurse
stretched
her
fingers
across
the
little
girl
babbling
mouth
equally
desperately
with
the
other
hand
she
sought
to
divert
the
little
girl
mind
by
pushing
the
fur
cap
back
from
her
frizzly
red
hair
and
loosening
her
sumptuous
coat
and
jerking
down
vainly
across
two
painfully
obtrusive
white
ruffles
the
awkwardly
short
hideously
bright
little
purple
dress
i
think
your
cap
is
too
hot
she
began
casually
and
then
proceeded
with
increasing
vivacity
and
conviction
to
the
objects
that
worried
her
most
and
those
those
ruffles
she
protested
they
do
look
a
bit
nice
being
so
long
resentfully
she
rubbed
an
edge
of
the
purple
dress
between
her
fingers
and
a
little
girl
like
you
with
such
bright
red
hair
ought
to
wear
purple
she
admonished
with
real
concern
now
whites
and
blues
and
little
soft
grays
mumblingly
through
her
mouth
the
little
girl
burst
into
explanations
again
oh
but
when
i
wear
gray
she
persisted
the
parpa
never
sees
me
but
when
i
wear
purple
he
cares
he
cares
most
awfully
she
boasted
with
a
bitter
sort
of
triumph
why
when
i
wear
purple
and
frizz
my
hair
hard
enough
no
matter
who
there
or
anything
he
stop
right
off
short
in
the
middle
of
whatever
he
doing
and
rear
right
up
so
perfectly
beautiful
and
mad
and
glorious
and
holler
right
out
heaven
sake
take
that
colored
sunday
supplement
away
your
father
nervous
suggested
the
white
linen
nurse
almost
tenderly
the
little
girl
reached
up
and
drew
the
white
linen
nurse
ear
close
down
to
her
own
snuggling
lips
damned
nervous
she
confided
laconically
quite
against
all
intention
the
white
linen
nurse
giggled
floundering
to
recover
her
dignity
she
plunged
into
a
new
error
poor
little
dev
she
began
yes
sighed
the
little
girl
complacently
that
just
what
the
parpa
calls
me
fervidly
she
clasped
her
little
hands
together
yes
if
i
can
only
make
him
mad
enough
daytimes
she
asserted
then
at
night
when
he
thinks
i
all
asleep
he
comes
and
stands
by
my
like
a
great
black
and
shakes
and
shakes
his
most
beautiful
head
and
says
little
devil
poor
little
devil
oh
if
i
can
only
make
him
mad
enough
daytimes
she
cried
out
ecstatically
why
you
naughty
little
thing
scolded
the
white
linen
nurse
with
an
unmistakable
catch
in
her
voice
why
you
naughty
naughty
little
thing
like
the
brush
of
a
butterfly
wing
the
child
hand
grazed
the
white
linen
nurse
cheek
i
a
lonely
little
thing
she
confided
wistfully
oh
i
an
awfully
lonely
little
thing
with
really
shocking
abruptness
the
old
malicious
smile
came
twittering
back
to
her
mouth
but
i
get
even
with
the
parpa
yet
she
threatened
joyously
reaching
out
with
pliant
fingers
to
count
the
buttons
on
the
white
linen
nurse
dress
oh
i
get
even
with
the
parpa
yet
in
the
midst
of
the
passionate
assertion
her
rigid
little
mouth
relaxed
in
a
most
mild
and
innocent
yawn
oh
of
course
she
yawned
on
wash
days
and
ironing
days
and
every
other
work
day
in
the
week
he
has
to
be
away
cutting
up
people
that
his
lawful
business
but
sundays
when
he
does
really
need
to
at
all
he
goes
off
to
some
kind
of
a
green
grassy
club
all
day
long
and
plays
golf
very
palpably
her
eyelids
began
to
droop
where
was
i
she
asked
sharply
oh
yes
green
grassy
club
well
when
i
die
she
faltered
i
going
to
die
specially
on
some
sunday
when
there
a
big
golf
game
so
he
just
naturally
have
to
give
it
up
and
stay
home
and
amuse
me
and
help
arrange
the
flowers
the
parpa
crazy
about
flowers
so
am
i
she
added
broodingly
i
raised
almost
a
geranium
once
but
the
parpa
threw
it
out
it
was
a
good
geranium
too
all
it
did
was
just
to
drip
the
bit
over
a
book
and
a
writing
and
somebody
brains
in
a
dish
he
threw
it
at
a
cat
it
was
a
good
cat
too
all
it
did
was
to
a
little
jerkily
her
drooping
head
bobbed
forward
and
then
back
again
her
heavy
eyes
were
almost
tight
shut
by
this
time
and
after
a
silence
her
lips
began
moving
dumbly
like
one
at
silent
devotions
making
a
little
poem
now
she
confided
at
last
it
about
you
and
me
it
a
sort
of
a
little
prayer
very
very
softly
she
began
to
repeat
now
i
sit
me
down
to
nap
all
curled
up
in
a
nursie
lap
if
should
die
before
i
wake
abruptly
she
stopped
and
stared
up
suspiciously
into
the
white
linen
nurse
eyes
ha
she
mocked
you
thought
i
was
going
to
say
i
should
die
before
i
wake
did
you
i
it
would
have
been
more
generous
acknowledged
the
white
linen
nurse
very
stiffly
the
little
girl
pursed
her
lips
it
plenty
generous
enough
when
it
all
done
she
said
severely
and
i
thank
you
miss
malgregor
not
to
interrupt
me
again
with
excessive
deliberateness
she
went
back
to
the
first
line
of
her
poem
and
began
all
over
again
now
i
sit
me
down
to
nap
all
curled
up
in
a
nursie
lap
if
should
die
before
i
wake
give
her
give
her
ten
cents
for
jesus
sake
why
that
a
a
cunning
little
prayer
yawned
the
white
linen
nurse
most
certainly
of
course
she
would
have
smiled
if
the
yawn
had
caught
her
first
but
now
in
the
middle
of
the
yawn
it
was
a
great
deal
easier
to
repeat
the
very
cunning
than
to
force
her
lips
into
any
new
expression
very
cunning
very
cunning
she
kept
crooning
conscientiously
modestly
like
some
other
successful
authors
the
little
girl
flapped
her
eyelids
languidly
open
and
shut
for
three
or
four
times
before
she
acknowledged
the
compliment
oh
cunning
as
any
of
she
admitted
only
once
again
did
she
open
either
mouth
or
eyes
and
this
time
it
was
merely
one
eye
and
half
a
mouth
do
my
fat
iron
braces
hurt
you
she
mumbled
drowsily
yes
a
little
conceded
the
white
linen
nurse
ha
they
hurt
me
all
the
time
gibed
the
little
girl
five
minutes
later
the
child
who
did
particularly
care
about
being
held
and
the
girl
who
did
particularly
care
about
holding
her
were
fast
asleep
in
each
other
arms
a
naughty
nagging
restive
little
hornet
all
hushed
up
and
in
the
heart
of
a
pink
stalking
out
of
the
house
in
his
own
due
time
the
senior
surgeon
reared
back
aghast
at
the
sight
well
i
be
hanged
he
muttered
most
everlastingly
hanged
wonder
what
they
think
this
is
a
somnolent
kindergarten
show
talk
about
fiddling
while
rome
burns
awkwardly
on
the
top
step
he
struggled
alone
into
his
cumbersome
coat
every
tingling
nerve
in
his
body
every
shuddering
sensibility
was
racked
to
its
utmost
capacity
over
the
distressing
scenes
he
had
left
behind
him
in
the
big
house
back
in
that
luxuriant
sickroom
youth
incarnate
lay
stripped
root
branch
leaf
bud
blossom
fruit
of
all
its
manhood
promise
back
in
that
erudite
library
culture
personified
robbed
of
all
its
fine
philosophy
sat
babbling
illiterate
into
its
quivering
hands
back
in
that
exquisite
pink
and
gold
boudoir
blonded
fashion
ravished
for
once
of
all
its
artistry
ran
stumbling
round
and
round
in
interminable
circles
like
a
disheveled
hag
in
shrill
crescendos
and
discordant
basses
with
heartpiercing
jaggedness
with
raspishness
each
one
boy
father
mother
meddlesome
relative
competent
or
incompetent
assistant
indiscriminate
servant
filing
his
separate
sorrow
into
the
senior
surgeon
tortured
ears
with
one
of
those
sudden
revulsions
to
materialism
which
is
liable
to
overwhelm
any
man
who
delves
too
long
at
a
time
in
the
brutally
unconventional
issues
of
life
and
death
the
senior
surgeon
stepped
down
into
the
subtle
sunshine
with
every
latent
human
greed
in
his
body
clamoring
for
expression
before
it
too
should
be
hurtled
into
oblivion
eat
you
fool
and
drink
you
fool
and
be
merry
you
fool
for
you
lendicott
faber
may
have
to
brawled
and
through
his
mind
like
a
ribald
phonograph
tune
at
the
edge
of
the
bottom
step
a
precipitous
lilac
branch
that
must
have
budded
and
bloomed
in
a
single
hour
smote
him
stingingly
across
his
cheek
laggard
taunted
the
lilac
branch
with
the
first
crunching
grit
of
gravel
under
his
feet
something
transcendently
naked
and
unashamed
that
was
neither
brazen
sorrow
nor
brazen
pain
thrilled
across
his
startled
consciousness
over
the
rolling
marshy
meadow
beyond
the
succulent
that
hid
the
winding
river
up
from
some
fluent
slim
canoe
out
from
a
chorus
of
virile
young
tenor
voices
a
little
passionate
love
song
divinely
tender
most
incomparably
innocent
came
stealing
palpitantly
forth
into
that
inflammable
spring
world
without
a
single
vestige
of
accompaniment
on
it
kiss
me
sweet
the
spring
is
here
and
love
is
lord
of
you
and
me
there
no
bird
in
brake
or
brere
but
to
his
little
mate
sings
he
kiss
me
sweet
the
spring
is
here
and
love
is
lord
of
you
and
me
wrenched
like
a
sob
out
of
his
own
lost
youth
the
senior
faltering
college
memories
took
up
the
old
refrain
as
i
go
singing
to
my
dear
kiss
me
sweet
the
spring
is
here
and
love
is
lord
of
you
and
me
just
for
an
instant
a
dozen
pictures
lanced
themselves
poignantly
into
his
brain
dingy
uncontrovertible
old
recitation
rooms
where
young
ideas
flashed
bright
and
futile
as
parade
swords
slopes
where
lithe
young
bodies
lolled
on
green
velvet
grasses
to
expound
their
harshest
cynicisms
all
the
paper
passion
of
all
the
paper
poets
swaggering
imperiously
on
boyish
lips
that
would
have
died
a
thousand
bashful
deaths
before
the
threatening
imminence
of
a
real
girl
kiss
magic
days
with
youth
the
one
glittering
positive
treasure
on
the
tree
of
life
and
woman
still
a
mystery
woman
a
mystery
harshly
the
phrase
ripped
through
the
senior
surgeon
brain
croakingly
in
that
instant
all
the
grim
gray
scientific
years
him
swamped
him
strangled
him
woman
a
oh
ye
gods
and
youth
bah
youth
a
mere
tinsel
tinkle
on
a
rotting
christmas
tree
furiously
with
renewed
venom
he
turned
and
threw
his
weight
again
upon
the
stubbornly
resistant
crank
of
his
automobile
vaguely
disturbed
by
the
noise
and
vibration
the
white
linen
nurse
opened
her
big
drowsy
blue
eyes
upon
him
do
jerk
it
so
she
admonished
hazily
you
wake
the
little
girl
well
what
about
my
convenience
i
like
to
know
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
in
some
astonishment
heavily
the
white
linen
nurse
lashes
shadowed
down
again
across
her
cheeks
oh
never
mind
about
that
she
mumbled
oh
for
heaven
sake
wake
up
there
bellowed
the
senior
surgeon
above
the
sudden
roar
of
his
engine
adroitly
for
a
man
of
his
bulk
he
ran
around
the
radiator
and
jumped
into
his
seat
joggled
unmercifully
into
wakefulness
the
little
girl
greeted
his
return
with
a
generous
if
distinctly
demonstration
of
affection
grabbing
the
unwitting
fingers
of
his
momentarily
free
hand
she
tapped
them
proudly
against
the
white
linen
nurse
plump
pink
cheek
see
i
call
her
she
boasted
joyously
with
all
the
triumphant
air
of
one
who
felt
assured
that
mental
discrimination
such
as
this
could
not
possibly
fail
to
impress
even
a
person
so
naturally
obtuse
as
a
father
do
be
foolish
snarled
the
senior
surgeon
who
me
gasped
the
white
linen
nurse
in
a
perfect
agony
of
confusion
yes
you
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
explosively
half
an
hour
later
after
interminable
miles
of
absolute
silence
and
dingy
yellow
and
bare
brown
alder
bushes
truly
out
of
the
ascetic
habit
of
his
daily
life
where
no
rain
was
as
the
bible
would
put
it
it
did
seem
to
him
distinctly
foolish
not
to
say
careless
not
to
say
out
and
out
incendiary
for
any
girl
to
go
blushing
her
way
like
a
through
a
world
so
palpably
populated
by
young
men
whose
heads
were
tow
and
hearts
indisputably
tinder
rather
than
tender
yes
you
he
reasserted
vehemently
at
the
end
of
another
silent
mile
then
plainly
begrudging
this
second
inexcusable
interruption
of
his
most
vital
musings
concerning
spinal
meningitis
he
scowled
his
way
savagely
back
again
into
his
own
grimly
established
trend
of
thought
excited
by
so
much
perfectly
good
silence
that
nobody
seemed
to
be
using
the
little
crippled
girl
ventured
gallantly
forth
once
more
into
the
hazardous
conversational
land
of
father
she
experimented
cautiously
with
most
commendable
discretion
fathoms
deep
in
abstraction
the
senior
surgeon
stared
unheeding
into
the
whizzing
black
road
pulses
and
temperatures
and
were
seething
in
his
mind
and
sharp
sticks
and
jagged
stones
and
the
general
possibilities
of
a
puncture
and
murmurs
of
the
heart
and
r√¢les
of
the
lungs
and
a
most
unaccountable
in
the
engine
and
the
probable
relation
of
disease
and
the
perfectly
positive
symptoms
of
optic
neuritis
and
a
damned
funny
squeak
in
the
steering
gear
father
the
little
girl
persisted
valiantly
to
add
to
his
original
concentration
the
senior
surgeon
linen
collar
began
to
chafe
him
maddeningly
under
his
chin
the
annoyance
added
two
scowls
to
his
already
blackly
furrowed
face
and
at
least
ten
miles
an
hour
to
his
running
time
but
nothing
whatsoever
to
his
conversational
ability
father
the
little
girl
whimpered
with
faltering
courage
then
as
wiser
people
have
been
before
her
over
the
dreadful
spookish
remoteness
of
a
perfectly
normal
human
being
who
refuses
either
to
answer
or
even
to
notice
your
wildest
efforts
at
communication
she
raised
her
waspish
voice
in
its
shrillest
harshest
fat
father
father
she
screeched
out
frenziedly
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
the
agony
of
a
wounded
rabbit
was
in
the
cry
the
last
gurgling
gasp
of
strangulation
under
a
murderer
reeking
fingers
catastrophe
unspeakable
disaster
now
irrevocable
clamping
down
his
brakes
with
a
wrench
that
almost
tore
the
insides
out
of
his
engine
the
senior
surgeon
brought
the
great
car
to
a
staggering
standstill
what
is
it
he
cried
in
real
terror
what
is
it
limply
the
little
girl
stretched
down
from
the
white
linen
nurse
lap
till
she
could
nick
her
toe
against
the
shiniest
woodwork
in
sight
altogether
aimlessly
her
small
chin
began
to
burrow
deeper
and
deeper
into
her
big
fur
collar
for
heaven
sake
what
do
you
want
demanded
the
senior
surgeon
even
yet
along
his
spine
the
little
nerves
crinkled
with
shock
and
apprehension
for
heaven
sake
what
do
you
want
helplessly
the
child
lifted
her
turbid
eyes
to
his
with
unmistakable
appeal
her
tiny
hand
went
clutching
out
at
one
of
the
big
buttons
on
his
coat
desperately
for
an
instant
she
rummaged
through
her
brain
for
some
remotely
adequate
answer
to
this
most
thunderous
question
and
then
retreated
precipitously
as
usual
to
the
sacristy
of
her
own
imagination
all
the
birds
there
father
she
confided
guilelessly
all
the
birds
there
with
yellow
feathers
instead
of
hair
and
bumblebees
crocheted
in
the
trees
and
short
of
complete
annihilation
there
was
no
satisfying
vengeance
whatsoever
that
the
senior
surgeon
exploding
passion
could
wreak
upon
his
offspring
complete
annihilation
being
unfeasible
at
the
moment
he
merely
climbed
laboriously
out
of
the
car
the
engine
climbed
laboriously
back
into
his
place
and
started
on
his
way
once
more
all
the
red
blustering
rage
was
stripped
completely
from
him
startlingly
rigid
startlingly
white
his
face
was
like
the
of
a
pirate
pleasantly
excited
by
the
little
girl
resumed
her
beloved
falsetto
chant
rhythmically
all
the
while
with
her
puny
legs
beating
the
tune
into
the
white
linen
tender
flesh
all
the
birds
were
there
with
yellow
feathers
instead
of
hair
and
bumblebees
crocheted
in
the
trees
and
and
all
the
birds
were
there
with
yellow
feathers
instead
of
hair
and
frenziedly
as
a
runaway
horse
trying
to
escape
from
its
own
pursuing
harness
and
carriage
the
senior
surgeon
poured
increasing
speed
into
both
his
own
pace
and
the
pace
of
his
tormentor
up
hill
down
dale
screeching
through
rocky
echoes
swishing
through
dodging
indomitable
boulders
grazing
lax
treacherous
embankments
the
great
car
scuttled
homeward
huddled
behind
his
steering
wheel
like
a
warrior
behind
his
shield
every
taut
with
strain
every
facial
muscle
diabolically
calm
the
senior
surgeon
met
and
parried
successively
each
fresh
onslaught
of
yard
rod
mile
then
suddenly
in
the
first
precipitous
descent
of
a
mighty
hill
the
whole
earth
seemed
to
drop
out
from
under
the
car
with
incredible
swiftness
and
smoothness
the
great
machine
went
diving
towards
abysmal
space
with
incredible
bumps
and
bouncings
trees
bushes
stonewalls
went
rushing
to
the
sky
gasping
surprisedly
towards
the
senior
surgeon
the
white
linen
nurse
saw
his
grim
mouth
yank
round
abruptly
in
her
direction
as
it
yanked
sometimes
in
the
with
some
sharp
incisive
order
of
life
or
death
instinctively
she
leaned
forward
for
the
message
not
but
strangely
distinct
the
words
slapped
back
into
her
straining
ears
if
it
will
rest
your
face
any
to
look
scared
by
all
means
do
so
i
lost
control
of
the
machine
called
the
senior
surgeon
sardonically
across
the
roar
of
the
wind
the
phrase
excited
the
white
linen
nurse
but
it
did
not
remotely
frighten
her
she
was
not
in
the
habit
of
seeing
the
senior
surgeon
lose
control
of
any
situation
merely
intoxicated
with
speed
delirious
with
ozone
she
snatched
up
the
little
girl
close
to
her
breast
we
flying
she
cried
we
dropping
from
a
parachute
we
swoopingly
like
a
sled
striking
glare
level
ice
the
great
car
swerved
from
the
bottom
of
the
hill
into
a
soft
rolling
meadow
instantly
from
every
conceivable
direction
like
foes
in
ambush
trees
stumps
rocks
reared
up
in
threatening
defiance
tighter
and
tighter
the
white
linen
nurse
crushed
the
little
girl
to
her
breast
louder
and
louder
she
called
in
the
little
girl
ear
scream
she
shouted
there
might
be
a
bump
scream
louder
than
a
bump
scream
scream
scream
in
that
first
terror
of
his
whole
life
as
the
great
car
tilted
up
against
a
stone
plowed
down
into
the
mushy
edge
of
a
marsh
and
skidded
completely
round
into
a
tree
it
was
the
last
sound
that
the
senior
surgeon
heard
the
sound
of
a
woman
and
child
screeching
their
lungs
out
in
diabolical
exultancy
chapter
v
when
the
white
linen
nurse
found
anything
again
she
found
herself
lying
perfectly
flat
on
her
back
in
a
reasonably
comfortable
nest
of
grass
and
leaves
staring
inquisitively
up
into
the
sky
she
thought
she
noticed
a
slight
black
and
blue
discoloration
towards
the
west
but
more
than
that
much
to
her
relief
the
firmament
did
not
seem
to
be
seriously
injured
the
earth
she
feared
had
not
escaped
so
easily
even
way
off
somewhere
near
the
tip
of
her
fingers
the
ground
was
as
sore
as
sore
as
could
be
under
her
touch
impulsively
to
her
dizzy
eyes
the
hot
tears
started
to
think
that
now
tired
as
she
was
she
should
have
to
jump
right
up
in
another
minute
or
two
and
attend
to
the
poor
earth
fortunately
for
any
really
strenuous
emergency
that
might
arise
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
about
her
own
body
that
hurt
at
all
except
a
queer
persistent
little
pain
in
her
cheek
not
until
the
little
crippled
girl
face
intervened
between
her
own
staring
eyes
and
the
sky
did
she
realize
that
the
pain
in
her
cheek
was
a
pinch
wake
up
wake
up
scolded
the
little
crippled
girl
shrilly
naughty
pink
and
white
nursie
i
wanted
to
hear
the
bump
you
screamed
so
loud
i
could
hear
the
bump
with
excessive
caution
the
white
linen
nurse
struggled
up
at
last
to
a
sitting
posture
and
gazed
perplexedly
around
her
it
seemed
to
be
a
perfectly
pleasant
field
acres
and
acres
of
mild
old
grass
tottering
palsiedly
down
to
watch
some
skittish
young
violets
and
bluets
frolic
in
and
out
of
a
giggling
brook
up
the
field
up
the
field
hazily
the
white
linen
nurse
ground
her
knuckles
into
her
incredulous
eyes
up
the
field
just
beyond
them
the
great
empty
automobile
stood
amiably
at
rest
from
the
general
appearance
of
the
at
the
top
of
the
little
grassy
slope
it
was
palpably
evident
that
the
car
had
attempted
certain
vain
acrobatic
feats
before
its
failing
momentum
had
forced
it
into
the
humiliating
ranks
of
the
still
grinding
her
knuckles
into
her
eyes
the
white
linen
nurse
turned
back
to
the
little
girl
under
the
torn
twisted
sable
cap
one
little
eye
was
hidden
completely
but
the
other
eye
loomed
up
rakish
and
bruised
as
a
prizefighter
one
sable
sleeve
was
wrenched
disastrously
from
its
and
along
the
edge
of
the
vivid
little
purple
skirt
the
white
ruffles
seemed
to
have
raveled
out
into
hopeless
yards
and
yards
and
yards
of
hamburg
embroidery
a
trifle
the
little
girl
began
to
gather
herself
together
we
we
seem
to
have
fallen
out
of
something
she
confided
with
the
air
of
one
who
halves
a
most
precious
secret
yes
i
know
said
the
white
linen
nurse
but
what
has
become
of
your
father
worriedly
for
an
instant
the
little
girl
sat
scanning
the
remotest
corners
of
the
field
then
abruptly
with
a
gasp
of
real
relief
she
began
to
explore
with
cautious
fingers
the
geographical
outline
of
her
black
eye
oh
never
mind
about
father
she
asserted
cheerfully
i
guess
i
guess
he
got
mad
and
went
home
yes
i
know
mused
the
white
linen
nurse
but
it
seem
probable
probable
mocked
the
little
girl
most
disagreeably
then
suddenly
her
little
hand
went
shooting
out
towards
the
stranded
automobile
why
there
he
is
she
screamed
under
the
car
oh
look
look
lookey
laboriously
the
white
linen
nurse
scrambled
to
her
knees
desperately
she
tried
to
ram
her
fingers
like
a
clog
into
the
whirling
dizziness
round
her
temples
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
what
the
dose
for
anybody
under
a
car
she
babbled
idiotically
then
with
a
really
herculean
effort
both
mental
and
physical
she
staggered
to
her
feet
and
started
for
the
automobile
but
her
knees
gave
out
and
wilting
down
to
the
grass
she
tried
to
crawl
along
on
till
straining
wrists
sent
her
back
to
her
feet
again
whenever
she
tried
to
walk
the
little
girl
walked
whenever
she
tried
to
crawl
the
little
girl
crawled
is
it
fun
the
shrill
childish
voice
piped
persistently
is
it
just
like
playing
when
they
reached
the
car
both
woman
and
child
were
too
utterly
exhausted
with
breathlessness
to
do
anything
except
just
sit
down
on
the
ground
and
stare
sure
enough
under
that
monstrous
immovable
looking
machine
the
senior
surgeon
body
lay
rammed
deep
deep
into
the
grass
it
was
the
little
girl
who
recovered
her
breath
first
i
think
he
dead
she
volunteered
sagely
his
legs
look
awfully
dead
to
me
only
excitement
was
in
the
statement
it
took
a
second
or
two
for
her
little
mind
to
make
any
particularly
personal
application
of
such
excitement
i
had
exactly
planned
on
having
him
dead
she
began
with
imperious
resentment
a
threat
of
complete
emotional
collapse
suddenly
across
her
face
i
wo
have
him
dead
i
wo
i
she
screamed
out
stormily
in
the
amazing
silence
that
ensued
the
white
linen
nurse
gathered
her
trembling
knees
up
into
the
circle
of
her
arms
and
sat
there
staring
at
the
senior
surgeon
prostrate
body
and
rocking
herself
feebly
to
and
fro
in
a
futile
effort
to
collect
her
scattered
senses
oh
if
some
one
would
only
tell
me
what
to
do
i
know
i
could
do
it
oh
i
know
i
could
do
it
if
some
one
would
only
tell
me
what
to
do
she
kept
repeating
helplessly
cautiously
the
little
girl
crept
forward
on
her
hands
and
knees
to
the
edge
of
the
car
and
peered
speculatively
through
the
great
yellow
father
she
faltered
in
almost
inaudible
gentleness
father
she
pleaded
in
perfectly
impotent
whisper
impetuously
the
white
linen
nurse
scrambled
to
her
own
hands
and
knees
and
jostled
the
little
girl
aside
fat
father
screamed
the
white
linen
nurse
fat
father
fat
father
father
she
gibed
and
taunted
with
the
one
call
she
knew
that
had
never
yet
failed
to
rouse
him
perceptibly
across
the
senior
surgeon
horridly
quiet
shoulders
a
little
twitch
wrinkled
and
was
gone
again
oh
his
heart
gasped
the
white
linen
nurse
i
must
find
his
heart
throwing
herself
prone
upon
the
cool
meadowy
ground
and
frantically
reaching
out
under
the
running
board
of
the
car
to
her
full
arm
length
she
began
to
rummage
awkwardly
hither
and
yon
beneath
the
heavy
weight
of
the
man
in
the
desperate
hope
of
feeling
a
ouch
you
tickle
me
spluttered
the
senior
surgeon
weakly
rolling
back
quickly
with
fright
and
relief
the
white
linen
nurse
burst
forth
into
one
maddening
cackle
of
hysterical
laughter
ha
ha
ha
she
giggled
hi
hi
titter
titter
titter
perplexedly
at
first
but
with
increasing
abandon
the
little
girl
voice
took
up
the
same
idiotic
refrain
she
choked
and
and
titter
titter
titter
with
an
agonizing
jerk
of
his
neck
the
senior
surgeon
rooted
his
mouth
a
half
inch
further
towards
free
and
spontaneous
speech
very
laboriously
very
painstakingly
he
spat
out
one
by
one
two
stones
and
a
wisp
of
ground
pine
and
a
brackish
prickly
tickle
of
stale
blank
he
announced
in
due
time
blank
maybe
when
you
two
imbeciles
have
got
through
your
cackling
you
have
the
decency
to
save
my
my
blank
life
ha
ha
ha
persisted
the
poor
helpless
white
linen
nurse
with
the
tears
streaming
down
her
cheeks
hi
hi
hi
snickered
the
poor
little
girl
through
her
hiccoughs
feeling
hopelessly
crushed
under
two
tons
and
a
half
of
car
the
senior
surgeon
closed
his
eyes
for
death
no
man
of
his
weight
he
felt
quite
sure
could
reasonably
expect
to
survive
many
minutes
longer
the
apoplectic
rage
that
pounded
in
his
through
his
eyelids
very
very
slowly
a
red
glow
seemed
to
permeate
he
thought
it
was
the
fires
of
hell
opening
his
eyes
to
meet
his
fate
like
a
man
he
found
himself
staring
impudently
close
instead
into
the
white
linen
nurse
furiously
flushed
face
that
lay
cuddled
on
one
plump
cheek
staring
impudently
close
at
him
why
why
get
out
gasped
the
senior
surgeon
very
modestly
the
white
linen
nurse
face
retreated
a
little
further
into
its
blushes
yes
i
know
she
protested
but
i
all
through
giggling
now
sorry
i
in
sheer
apprehensiveness
the
senior
surgeon
features
crinkled
wincingly
from
brow
to
chin
as
though
struggling
vainly
to
retreat
from
the
appalling
proximity
of
the
girl
face
your
eyelashes
are
too
long
he
complained
querulously
eh
jerked
the
white
linen
nurse
face
is
it
your
brain
hurt
oh
sir
do
you
think
it
your
brain
that
hurt
it
my
stomach
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
i
tell
you
i
not
hurt
i
just
squashed
i
paralyzed
if
i
ca
get
this
car
off
me
yes
that
just
it
beamed
the
white
linen
nurse
face
that
just
what
i
crawled
in
here
to
find
out
how
to
get
the
car
off
you
just
what
i
want
to
find
out
i
could
run
for
help
of
course
only
i
could
run
my
knees
are
so
wobbly
it
would
take
hours
and
the
car
might
start
or
burn
up
or
something
while
i
was
gone
but
you
do
seem
to
be
caught
anywhere
on
the
machinery
she
added
more
brightly
it
only
seems
to
be
sitting
on
you
so
if
i
could
only
get
the
car
off
you
but
it
so
heavy
i
had
no
idea
it
would
be
so
heavy
could
i
take
it
apart
do
you
think
is
there
any
one
place
where
i
could
begin
at
the
beginning
and
take
it
all
apart
take
it
apart
hell
groaned
the
senior
surgeon
a
little
twitch
of
defiance
flickered
across
the
white
linen
face
all
the
same
she
asserted
stubbornly
if
some
one
would
only
tell
me
what
to
do
i
know
i
could
do
it
horridly
from
some
unlocatable
quarter
of
the
engine
an
alarming
little
tremor
quickened
suddenly
and
was
hushed
again
get
out
of
here
quick
stormed
the
senior
surgeon
ghastly
face
i
wo
said
the
white
linen
nurse
face
until
you
tell
me
what
to
do
brutally
for
an
instant
the
ingenuous
blue
eyes
and
the
cynical
gray
eyes
battled
each
other
you
do
what
you
told
faltered
the
senior
surgeon
oh
yes
said
the
white
linen
nurse
i
mean
can
you
do
exactly
what
you
told
gasped
the
senior
surgeon
can
you
follow
directions
i
mean
can
you
follow
them
explicitly
or
are
you
one
of
those
people
who
listens
only
to
her
own
judgment
oh
but
i
have
got
any
judgment
protested
the
white
linen
nurse
palpably
in
the
senior
surgeon
eyes
the
leisurely
seeming
diagnosis
leaped
to
precipitous
conclusions
then
get
out
of
here
quick
for
god
sake
and
get
to
work
he
ordered
cautiously
the
white
linen
nurse
jerked
herself
back
into
freedom
and
crawled
around
and
stared
at
the
senior
surgeon
through
the
again
like
one
worrying
out
some
intricate
mathematical
problem
his
mental
strain
was
pulsing
visibly
through
his
closed
eyelids
yes
sir
prodded
the
white
linen
nurse
keep
still
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
i
got
to
think
he
said
i
got
to
work
it
out
all
in
a
moment
you
got
to
learn
to
run
the
car
all
in
a
moment
it
awful
oh
i
do
mind
sir
affirmed
the
white
linen
nurse
serenely
frenziedly
the
senior
surgeon
rooted
one
cheek
into
the
mud
again
you
do
he
groaned
you
do
why
you
got
to
learn
everything
everything
from
the
very
beginning
oh
that
all
right
sir
crooned
the
white
linen
nurse
ominously
from
somewhere
a
horrid
sound
creaked
again
the
senior
surgeon
did
not
stop
to
argue
any
further
now
come
here
ordered
the
senior
surgeon
i
going
to
i
going
to
startlingly
his
voice
weakened
trailed
off
into
nothingness
and
rallied
suddenly
with
exaggerated
bruskness
look
here
now
for
heaven
sake
use
your
brains
i
going
to
dictate
to
you
very
slowly
one
thing
at
a
time
just
what
to
do
quite
astonishingly
the
white
linen
nurse
sank
down
on
her
knees
and
began
to
grin
at
him
oh
no
sir
she
said
i
could
do
it
that
way
not
thing
at
a
time
oh
no
indeed
sir
no
absolute
finality
was
in
her
voice
the
inviolable
stubbornness
of
the
perfectly
person
you
do
it
the
way
i
tell
you
to
roared
the
senior
surgeon
struggling
vainly
to
ease
one
shoulder
or
stretch
one
oh
no
sir
beamed
the
white
linen
nurse
not
one
thing
at
a
time
oh
no
i
could
do
it
that
way
oh
no
sir
i
wo
do
it
that
way
one
thing
at
a
time
she
persisted
hurriedly
why
you
might
faint
away
or
something
might
happen
right
in
the
middle
of
it
right
between
one
direction
and
another
and
i
would
know
at
all
what
to
turn
on
or
off
next
and
it
might
take
off
one
of
your
legs
you
know
or
an
arm
oh
no
not
one
thing
at
a
time
then
croaked
the
senior
surgeon
i
as
good
as
dead
now
a
single
shudder
went
through
him
a
last
futile
effort
to
stretch
himself
said
the
white
linen
nurse
i
heaps
rather
have
you
die
perfectly
whole
like
that
of
your
own
accord
than
have
me
run
the
risk
of
starting
the
car
and
chopping
you
up
so
or
dragging
you
off
so
that
you
did
find
it
convenient
to
tell
me
how
to
stop
the
car
you
a
a
a
spluttered
the
senior
surgeon
indistinguishably
went
that
mysterious
horrid
sound
from
somewhere
in
the
machinery
oh
my
god
surrendered
the
senior
surgeon
do
it
your
own
damned
way
only
only
his
voice
cracked
raspingly
steady
steady
there
said
the
white
linen
nurse
except
for
a
sudden
odd
pucker
at
the
end
of
her
nose
her
expression
was
still
perfectly
serene
now
begin
at
the
beginning
she
begged
quick
tell
me
everything
just
the
way
i
must
do
it
quick
quick
quick
twice
the
senior
surgeon
lips
opened
and
shut
with
a
vain
effort
to
comply
with
her
request
but
you
ca
do
it
he
began
all
over
again
it
is
possible
you
have
got
the
mind
maybe
i
have
said
the
white
linen
nurse
but
i
got
the
memory
hurry
creak
said
the
funny
little
something
in
the
machinery
creak
drip
bubble
oh
get
in
there
quick
surrendered
the
senior
surgeon
sit
down
behind
the
wheel
he
shouted
after
her
flying
footsteps
are
you
there
for
god
sake
are
you
there
do
you
see
those
two
little
levers
where
your
right
hand
comes
for
god
sake
do
you
know
what
a
lever
is
quick
now
do
just
what
i
tell
you
a
little
jerkily
then
but
very
clearly
very
concisely
the
senior
surgeon
called
out
to
the
white
linen
nurse
just
how
every
lever
every
pedal
should
be
manipulated
to
start
the
car
absolutely
accurately
absolutely
indelibly
the
white
linen
nurse
visualized
each
separate
detail
in
her
abnormally
retentive
mind
but
you
ca
possibly
remember
it
groaned
the
senior
surgeon
you
ca
possibly
and
probably
the
damn
car
and
start
anyway
and
abruptly
the
speech
ended
in
a
guttural
snarl
of
despair
do
be
a
blight
screamed
the
white
linen
nurse
i
never
forgotten
anything
yet
sir
very
tensely
she
straightened
up
suddenly
in
her
seat
her
expression
was
no
longer
even
remotely
pleasant
along
her
sensitive
fluctuant
nostrils
the
casual
crinkle
of
distaste
and
suspicion
had
deepened
suddenly
into
sheer
dilating
terror
left
foot
press
down
hard
left
pedal
she
began
to
to
herself
no
foot
foot
corrected
the
little
girl
blunderingly
from
somewhere
close
in
the
grass
inside
lever
pull
way
back
persisted
the
white
linen
nurse
resolutely
as
she
switched
on
the
current
no
lever
contradicted
the
little
girl
shut
your
darned
mouth
screeched
the
white
linen
nurse
her
hand
on
the
throttle
as
she
tried
the
self
starter
bruised
as
he
was
wretched
desperately
endangered
there
under
the
car
the
senior
surgeon
could
almost
have
grinned
at
the
girl
terse
unconscious
mimicry
of
his
own
most
venomous
tones
then
with
all
the
lusty
ebullient
years
of
his
life
snatched
from
his
lips
like
an
untasted
cup
and
one
single
noxious
second
urged
forced
crammed
down
his
choking
throat
he
felt
the
great
car
quicken
and
start
god
said
the
senior
surgeon
just
god
the
god
of
mud
he
meant
the
god
of
brackish
grass
the
god
of
a
man
lying
still
hopeful
under
more
than
two
tons
weight
of
unaccountable
mechanism
with
a
novice
in
full
command
up
in
her
crimson
leather
cushions
the
white
linen
nurse
heard
the
smothered
cry
clear
above
the
whirr
of
wheels
the
whizz
of
clogs
the
one
word
sizzled
like
a
poker
across
her
chattering
consciousness
tingling
through
the
grasp
of
her
fingers
on
the
vibrating
wheel
stinging
through
the
sole
of
her
foot
that
hovered
over
the
throbbing
clutch
she
sensed
the
agonized
appeal
short
lever
spark
long
lever
gas
she
persisted
resolutely
it
must
be
right
it
must
jerkily
then
and
blatantly
unskilfully
with
riotous
puffs
and
spinning
of
wheels
the
great
car
started
faltered
balked
a
bit
then
dragged
crushingly
across
the
senior
surgeon
flattened
body
and
with
a
great
wanton
burst
of
speed
tore
down
the
sloping
meadow
into
the
brook
rods
away
clamping
down
the
brakes
with
a
wrench
and
a
racket
like
the
smash
of
a
the
white
linen
nurse
jumped
out
into
the
brook
and
with
one
wild
terrified
glance
behind
her
staggered
back
up
the
long
grassy
slope
to
the
senior
surgeon
mechanically
through
her
lips
she
forced
the
greeting
that
sounded
most
cheerful
to
her
it
not
much
fun
sir
running
an
auto
she
gasped
i
do
believe
i
like
it
half
propped
up
on
one
elbow
still
dizzy
with
mental
chaos
still
paralyzed
with
physical
inertia
the
senior
surgeon
lay
staring
blankly
all
around
him
indifferently
for
an
instant
his
stare
included
the
white
linen
nurse
then
glowering
suddenly
at
something
way
beyond
her
his
face
went
perfectly
livid
good
god
the
the
car
on
fire
he
mumbled
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
why
did
you
know
it
sir
chapter
vi
headlong
the
senior
surgeon
pitched
over
on
the
grass
his
last
vestige
of
stripped
from
him
horror
unspeakable
racking
him
sobbingly
from
head
to
toe
whimperingly
the
little
girl
came
crawling
to
him
and
settling
down
close
at
his
feet
began
with
her
tiny
lace
handkerchief
to
make
futile
dabs
at
the
on
his
gray
silk
stockings
never
mind
father
she
coaxed
we
get
you
clean
sometime
nervously
the
white
linen
nurse
bethought
her
of
the
brook
oh
wait
a
minute
sir
and
i
get
you
a
drink
of
water
she
pleaded
bruskly
the
senior
surgeon
hand
jerked
out
and
grabbed
at
her
skirt
do
leave
me
he
begged
for
god
sake
do
leave
me
weakly
he
struggled
up
again
and
sat
staring
piteously
at
the
blazing
car
his
unrelinquished
clutch
on
the
white
linen
nurse
skirt
brought
her
sinking
softly
down
beside
him
like
a
collapsed
balloon
together
they
sat
and
watched
the
gaseous
yellow
flames
shoot
up
into
the
sky
it
pretty
is
it
piped
the
little
girl
eh
groaned
the
senior
surgeon
father
persisted
the
shrill
little
voice
father
do
people
ever
burn
up
gasped
the
senior
surgeon
brutally
the
harsh
shuddering
sobs
began
to
rack
and
tear
again
through
his
great
chest
there
there
crooned
the
white
linen
nurse
struggling
desperately
to
her
knees
let
me
get
everybody
a
drink
of
water
again
the
senior
surgeon
unrelinquished
clutch
on
her
skirt
jerked
her
back
to
the
place
beside
him
i
said
to
leave
he
snapped
out
as
roughly
as
he
jerked
before
the
affrighted
look
in
the
white
linen
nurse
face
a
sheepish
mirthless
grin
flickered
across
one
corner
of
his
mouth
lord
but
i
shaken
he
apologized
me
of
all
people
painfully
the
red
blood
mounted
to
his
cheeks
me
of
all
people
bluntly
he
forced
the
white
linen
nurse
reluctant
gaze
to
meet
his
own
only
yesterday
he
persisted
i
did
a
laparotomy
on
a
man
who
had
only
one
chance
in
a
hundred
of
pulling
through
and
i
i
scolded
him
for
fighting
off
his
ether
cone
scolded
him
i
tell
you
yes
i
know
soothed
the
white
linen
nurse
but
but
growled
the
senior
surgeon
the
fear
of
death
bah
all
my
life
i
scoffed
at
it
yes
of
course
when
you
have
to
but
with
no
kick
coming
why
i
been
wrecked
in
a
typhoon
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
i
did
care
and
i
lain
for
nine
days
more
dead
than
alive
in
an
asiatic
cholera
camp
and
i
did
care
and
i
been
locked
into
my
office
three
hours
with
a
raving
maniac
and
a
dynamite
bomb
and
i
did
care
and
twice
in
a
pennsylvania
mine
disaster
been
the
first
man
down
the
shaft
and
i
did
care
and
i
been
shot
i
tell
you
and
i
been
and
i
been
and
i
never
cared
but
piteously
all
the
pride
and
vigor
wilted
from
his
great
shoulders
leaving
him
all
huddled
up
like
a
woman
with
his
head
on
his
knees
but
mine
he
acknowledged
brokenly
once
again
the
white
linen
nurse
tried
to
rise
oh
please
sir
let
me
get
you
a
drink
of
water
she
suggested
helplessly
i
said
to
leave
me
jerked
the
senior
surgeon
perplexedly
with
big
staring
eyes
the
little
crippled
girl
glanced
up
at
this
strange
fatherish
person
who
sounded
so
suddenly
small
and
scared
like
herself
jealous
instantly
of
her
own
prerogatives
she
dropped
her
futile
labors
on
the
silk
stockings
and
scrambled
precipitously
for
the
white
linen
nurse
lap
where
she
nestled
down
finally
after
many
gyrations
and
sat
glowering
forth
at
all
possible
interlopers
do
leave
any
of
us
she
ordered
with
a
peremptoriness
not
unmixed
with
supplication
surely
some
one
will
see
the
fire
and
come
and
get
us
conceded
the
senior
surgeon
yes
surely
mused
the
white
linen
nurse
just
at
that
moment
she
was
mostly
concerned
with
adjusting
the
curve
of
her
shoulder
to
the
curve
of
the
little
girl
head
i
could
sit
more
comfortably
she
suggested
to
the
senior
surgeon
if
you
let
go
my
skirt
let
go
of
your
skirt
who
touching
your
skirt
gasped
the
senior
surgeon
incredulously
once
again
the
blood
mounted
darkly
to
his
face
i
think
i
get
up
and
walk
around
a
bit
he
confided
coldly
do
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
ouchily
with
a
tweak
of
pain
through
his
sprained
back
the
senior
surgeon
sat
suddenly
down
again
i
get
up
till
i
good
and
ready
he
attested
i
would
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
very
slowly
very
complacently
all
the
while
she
kept
right
on
renovating
the
little
girl
personal
appearance
smoothing
a
wrinkled
stocking
tucking
up
obstreperous
white
ruffles
tugging
down
parsimonious
purple
hems
loosening
a
pinchy
hook
tightening
a
wobbly
button
very
slowly
very
complacently
the
little
girl
drowsed
off
to
sleep
with
her
weazened
little
legs
stretched
stiffly
out
before
her
poor
little
legs
poor
little
legs
poor
little
legs
crooned
the
white
linen
nurse
i
do
know
as
you
need
to
make
a
song
about
it
winced
the
senior
surgeon
it
just
about
the
crudest
case
of
complete
muscular
atrophy
that
i
ever
seen
blandly
the
white
linen
nurse
lifted
her
big
blue
eyes
to
his
it
was
her
muscular
atrophy
that
i
was
thinking
about
she
said
it
her
panties
that
are
so
unbecoming
eh
jumped
the
senior
surgeon
poor
little
legs
poor
little
legs
poor
little
legs
resumed
the
white
linen
nurse
droningly
very
slowly
very
complacently
all
around
them
april
kept
right
on
being
april
very
slowly
very
complacently
all
around
them
the
grass
kept
on
growing
and
the
trees
kept
right
on
budding
very
slowly
very
complacently
all
around
them
the
blue
sky
kept
right
on
fading
into
its
early
evening
nothing
brisk
nothing
breathless
nothing
even
remotely
hurried
was
there
in
all
the
landscape
except
just
the
brook
and
the
flash
of
a
bird
and
the
blaze
of
the
crackling
automobile
the
white
linen
nurse
nostrils
were
smooth
and
calm
with
the
lovely
sappy
scent
of
maple
bark
and
arbutus
buds
the
white
linen
nurse
mind
was
full
of
sumptuous
succulent
marsh
marigolds
and
fluffy
white
blossoms
the
senior
surgeon
nostrils
were
all
puckered
up
with
the
stench
of
burning
varnish
the
senior
surgeon
mind
was
full
of
the
horrid
thought
that
he
forgotten
to
renew
his
automobile
and
that
he
had
a
sprained
back
and
that
his
rival
colleague
had
told
him
he
did
know
how
to
run
an
auto
anyway
and
that
the
cook
had
given
notice
that
morning
and
that
he
had
a
sprained
back
and
that
the
moths
had
gnawed
the
knees
out
of
his
new
dress
suit
and
that
the
superintendent
of
nurses
had
had
the
audacity
to
send
him
a
bunch
of
pink
roses
for
his
birthday
and
that
the
boiler
in
the
kitchen
leaked
and
that
he
had
to
go
to
philadelphia
the
next
day
to
read
a
paper
on
surgical
methods
at
the
battle
of
waterloo
and
he
even
begun
the
paper
yet
and
that
he
had
a
sprained
back
and
that
the
on
his
library
hung
in
shreds
and
tatters
waiting
for
him
to
decide
between
a
french
fresco
effect
and
an
early
english
paneling
and
that
his
little
daughter
was
growing
up
in
wanton
ugliness
under
the
care
of
coarse
indifferent
hirelings
and
that
the
laundry
robbed
him
weekly
of
at
least
five
socks
and
that
it
would
cost
him
fully
seven
thousand
dollars
to
replace
this
car
and
that
he
had
a
sprained
back
it
restful
is
it
cooed
the
white
linen
nurse
is
restful
glowered
the
senior
surgeon
sitting
down
said
the
white
linen
nurse
contemptuously
the
senior
surgeon
mind
ignored
the
interruption
and
reverted
precipitously
to
its
own
immediate
problem
concerning
the
gloomy
shadowed
entrance
hall
of
his
great
house
and
how
many
yards
of
imported
linoleum
at
a
yard
it
would
take
to
recarpet
the
damned
hole
and
how
it
would
have
seemed
anyway
if
if
he
had
gone
home
as
usual
to
the
horrid
shadows
that
night
but
been
carried
home
instead
feet
first
and
quite
dead
dead
mind
you
with
a
red
necktie
on
and
even
the
cook
was
out
and
they
would
even
know
where
to
lay
him
but
might
put
him
by
mistake
in
that
in
that
in
his
dead
wife
dead
bed
altogether
unconsciously
a
little
fluttering
sigh
of
ineffable
contentment
escaped
the
white
linen
nurse
i
do
care
how
long
we
have
to
sit
here
and
wait
for
help
she
announced
cheerfully
because
of
course
i
have
to
get
up
and
begin
all
over
again
and
go
to
nova
scotia
go
lurched
the
senior
surgeon
i
thank
you
kindly
sir
not
to
jerk
my
skirt
quite
so
hard
said
the
white
linen
nurse
just
a
trifle
stiffly
incredulously
once
more
the
senior
surgeon
withdrew
his
detaining
hand
i
not
even
touching
your
skirt
he
denied
desperately
nothing
but
denial
and
reiterated
denial
seemed
to
ease
his
for
an
instant
why
for
heaven
sake
should
i
want
to
hold
on
to
your
skirt
he
demanded
peremptorily
what
the
deuce
he
began
blusteringly
why
in
then
abruptly
he
stopped
and
shot
an
odd
puzzled
glance
at
the
white
linen
nurse
and
right
there
before
her
startled
eyes
she
saw
every
vestige
of
human
expression
fade
out
of
his
face
as
it
faded
out
sometimes
in
the
when
in
the
midst
of
some
ghastly
unforeseen
emergency
that
left
all
his
assistants
blinking
helplessly
around
them
his
whole
wonderful
scientific
mind
seemed
to
break
up
like
some
chemical
compound
into
all
its
meek
component
parts
only
to
reorganize
itself
suddenly
with
some
amazing
explosive
action
that
fairly
knocked
the
breath
out
of
all
but
was
pretty
apt
to
knock
the
breath
into
the
body
of
the
person
most
concerned
when
the
senior
surgeon
scientific
mind
had
reorganized
itself
to
meet
emergency
he
found
himself
infinitely
more
surprised
at
the
particular
type
of
explosion
that
had
taken
place
than
any
other
person
could
possibly
have
been
miss
malgregor
he
gasped
speaking
of
preferring
service
as
you
call
it
speaking
of
preferring
domestic
service
to
nursing
how
would
you
like
to
consider
to
consider
a
position
of
of
well
call
it
a
a
position
of
general
heartwork
for
a
family
of
two
myself
and
the
little
girl
here
being
the
as
you
understand
he
added
briskly
why
i
think
it
would
be
grand
beamed
the
white
linen
nurse
a
trifle
mockingly
the
senior
surgeon
bowed
his
appreciation
your
frank
and
immediate
enthusiasm
he
murmured
is
more
perhaps
than
i
had
dared
to
expect
but
it
would
be
grand
said
the
white
linen
nurse
before
the
odd
little
smile
in
the
senior
surgeon
eyes
her
white
forehead
puckered
all
up
with
perplexity
then
with
her
mind
still
thoroughly
unawakened
her
heart
began
suddenly
to
pitch
and
lurch
like
a
frightened
horse
whose
rider
has
not
even
remotely
sensed
as
yet
the
approach
of
an
unwonted
footfall
what
did
you
say
she
repeated
worriedly
just
exactly
what
was
it
that
you
said
i
guess
maybe
i
did
understand
just
exactly
what
it
was
that
you
said
the
smile
in
the
senior
surgeon
eyes
deepened
a
little
i
asked
you
he
said
how
you
would
like
to
consider
a
position
of
heartwork
in
a
family
of
two
myself
and
the
little
girl
here
being
the
was
what
i
said
yes
not
housework
faltered
the
white
linen
nurse
heartwork
i
know
what
you
mean
sir
like
two
falling
her
eyelids
fluttered
down
across
her
affrighted
eyes
oh
when
i
shut
my
eyes
sir
and
just
hear
your
voice
i
know
of
course
sir
that
it
some
sort
of
a
joke
but
when
i
look
right
at
you
i
do
know
what
it
is
open
your
eyes
and
keep
them
open
then
till
you
do
find
out
suggested
the
senior
surgeon
bluntly
defiantly
once
again
the
blue
eyes
and
the
gray
eyes
challenged
each
other
was
what
i
said
persisted
the
senior
surgeon
palpably
his
narrowing
eyes
shut
out
all
meaning
but
one
definite
one
the
white
linen
nurse
face
went
almost
as
blanched
as
her
dress
you
you
not
asking
me
to
marry
you
sir
she
stammered
i
suppose
i
am
acknowledged
the
senior
surgeon
not
marry
you
cried
the
white
linen
nurse
distress
was
in
her
voice
distaste
unmitigable
shock
as
though
the
high
gods
themselves
had
fallen
at
her
feet
and
splintered
off
into
mere
candy
fragments
oh
not
you
sir
she
kept
right
on
protesting
not
be
you
mean
oh
not
be
and
everything
well
why
not
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
like
a
smitten
flower
the
girl
whole
body
seemed
to
wilt
down
into
incalculable
weariness
oh
no
no
i
could
she
protested
oh
no
really
appealingly
she
lifted
her
great
blue
eyes
to
his
and
the
blueness
was
all
blurred
with
tears
i
i
been
engaged
once
you
know
she
explained
falteringly
why
i
was
engaged
sir
almost
as
soon
as
i
was
born
and
i
stayed
engaged
till
two
years
ago
that
almost
twenty
years
a
long
time
sir
you
do
get
over
it
easy
very
very
gravely
she
began
to
shake
her
head
oh
no
sir
no
thank
you
very
much
but
i
i
just
simply
could
begin
at
the
beginning
and
go
all
through
it
again
i
have
got
the
heart
for
it
i
have
got
the
spirit
your
initials
on
trees
and
and
gadding
round
to
all
the
sunday
school
picnics
brutally
like
a
boy
the
senior
surgeon
threw
back
his
head
in
one
wild
hoot
of
joy
infinitely
more
cautiously
as
the
agonizing
pang
in
his
shoulder
lulled
down
again
he
proceeded
to
argue
the
matter
but
the
grin
in
his
face
was
even
yet
faintly
traceable
frankly
miss
malgregor
he
affirmed
i
infinitely
more
addicted
to
carving
people
than
to
carving
trees
and
as
to
sunday
school
picnics
well
really
now
i
hardly
believe
that
you
find
my
demands
in
that
direction
excessive
perplexedly
the
white
linen
nurse
tried
to
stare
her
way
through
his
bantering
smile
to
his
real
meaning
furiously
as
she
stared
the
red
blood
came
flushing
back
into
her
face
you
do
mean
for
a
second
that
you
that
you
love
me
she
asked
incredulously
no
i
do
suppose
i
do
acknowledged
the
senior
surgeon
with
equal
bluntness
but
my
little
kiddie
here
loves
you
he
hastened
somewhat
nervously
to
affirm
oh
i
almost
sure
that
my
little
kiddie
here
loves
you
she
needs
you
anyway
let
it
go
at
that
call
it
that
we
both
need
you
what
you
mean
is
corrected
the
white
linen
nurse
that
needing
somebody
very
badly
you
just
suddenly
decided
that
that
somebody
might
as
well
be
me
well
if
you
choose
to
put
it
like
that
said
the
senior
surgeon
a
bit
sulkily
and
if
there
had
been
an
auto
accident
argued
the
white
linen
nurse
just
out
of
sheer
inquisitiveness
if
there
had
been
just
this
particular
kind
of
an
auto
accident
at
this
particular
hour
of
this
particular
day
of
this
particular
month
with
marigolds
and
everything
you
probably
never
would
have
realized
that
you
did
need
anybody
maybe
not
admitted
the
senior
surgeon
u
m
m
said
the
white
linen
nurse
and
if
you
happened
to
take
one
of
the
other
girls
instead
of
me
why
then
i
suppose
have
felt
that
she
was
the
one
you
really
needed
and
if
you
taken
the
superintendent
of
nurses
instead
of
any
of
us
girls
you
might
even
have
felt
that
was
the
one
you
most
needed
with
surprising
agility
for
a
man
with
a
sprained
back
the
senior
surgeon
wrenched
himself
around
until
he
faced
her
quite
squarely
now
see
here
miss
malgregor
he
growled
for
heaven
sake
listen
to
sense
even
if
you
ca
talk
it
here
am
i
a
plain
professional
man
making
you
a
plain
professional
offer
why
in
thunder
should
you
try
to
fuss
me
all
up
because
my
offer
is
couched
in
all
the
foolish
romantic
sort
of
that
you
think
such
an
offer
ought
to
be
couched
in
eh
fuss
you
all
up
sir
protested
the
white
linen
nurse
with
real
anxiety
yes
fuss
me
all
up
snarled
the
senior
surgeon
with
increasing
venom
i
no
i
not
trying
to
make
up
what
might
have
happened
a
year
from
next
february
in
a
chinese
junk
off
the
coast
of
nova
zembla
to
a
methodist
preacher
and
a
and
a
militant
suffragette
what
i
trying
to
size
up
is
just
what
happened
to
you
and
me
for
the
fact
remains
that
it
is
and
it
is
you
and
i
and
there
has
been
an
accident
and
out
of
that
accident
and
everything
gone
with
it
i
have
come
out
thinking
of
something
that
i
never
thought
of
before
and
there
were
marigolds
he
added
with
unexpected
whimsicality
you
see
i
do
deny
even
the
marigolds
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
yes
what
jerked
the
senior
surgeon
softly
the
white
linen
nurse
chin
burrowed
down
a
little
closer
against
the
sleeping
child
tangled
hair
why
yes
thank
you
very
much
but
i
never
shall
love
again
she
said
quite
definitely
love
gasped
the
senior
surgeon
why
i
not
asking
you
to
love
me
his
face
was
suddenly
crimson
why
i
hate
it
if
you
loved
me
why
i
o
h
h
mumbled
the
white
linen
nurse
in
new
embarrassment
then
suddenly
and
surprisingly
her
chin
came
tilting
bravely
up
again
what
do
you
want
she
asked
helplessly
the
senior
surgeon
threw
out
his
hands
my
goodness
he
said
what
do
you
suppose
i
want
want
some
one
to
take
care
of
us
gently
the
white
linen
nurse
shifted
her
shoulder
to
accommodate
the
shifting
little
sleepyhead
on
her
breast
you
can
hire
some
one
for
that
she
suggested
with
real
relief
i
was
trying
to
hire
you
said
the
senior
surgeon
quite
tersely
hire
me
gasped
the
white
linen
nurse
why
why
adroitly
she
slipped
both
hands
under
the
sleeping
child
and
delivered
the
little
heavily
ironed
body
into
the
senior
astonished
arms
i
i
do
want
to
hold
her
he
protested
she
is
mine
argued
the
white
linen
nurse
but
i
ca
talk
while
i
holding
her
insisted
the
senior
surgeon
i
ca
listen
while
i
holding
her
persisted
the
white
linen
nurse
freely
now
though
like
a
turk
she
jerked
herself
forward
on
the
grass
and
sat
probing
up
into
the
senior
surgeon
face
like
an
excited
puppy
trying
to
solve
whether
the
gift
in
your
hand
is
a
lump
of
sugar
or
a
live
coal
you
trying
to
hire
she
prompted
him
nudgingly
with
her
voice
hire
me
for
money
oh
my
lord
no
said
the
senior
surgeon
there
are
plenty
of
people
i
can
hire
for
money
but
they
wo
stay
he
explained
ruefully
hang
it
all
they
wo
stay
above
his
little
girl
white
pinched
face
his
own
ruddy
countenance
furrowed
suddenly
with
unspeakable
anxiety
why
just
this
last
year
he
complained
we
had
nine
different
housekeepers
and
thirteen
nursery
governesses
skilfully
as
a
surgeon
but
awkwardly
as
a
father
he
bent
to
the
weight
of
the
little
iron
but
i
tell
you
no
one
will
stay
with
us
he
finished
hotly
there
something
the
matter
with
us
i
do
seem
to
have
money
enough
in
the
world
to
make
anybody
stay
with
us
very
wryly
very
reluctantly
at
one
corner
of
his
mouth
his
sense
of
humor
ignited
in
a
feeble
grin
so
you
see
what
i
trying
to
do
to
you
miss
malgregor
is
to
hire
you
with
something
that
will
just
naturally
compel
you
to
stay
if
the
grin
round
his
mouth
strengthened
a
trifle
so
did
the
anxiety
in
his
eyes
for
heaven
sake
miss
malgregor
he
pleaded
here
a
man
and
a
house
and
a
child
all
going
to
rack
and
ruin
if
you
really
and
truly
tired
of
nursing
and
are
looking
for
a
new
job
what
the
matter
with
tackling
us
it
would
be
a
job
admitted
the
white
linen
nurse
demurely
why
it
would
be
a
confided
the
senior
surgeon
with
no
demureness
whatsoever
chapter
vii
very
soberly
very
thoughtfully
then
across
the
tangled
snuggling
head
of
his
own
and
another
woman
child
he
urged
the
torments
and
the
comforts
of
his
home
upon
this
second
woman
what
is
there
about
my
offer
that
you
do
like
he
demanded
earnestly
is
it
the
whole
idea
that
offends
you
or
just
the
way
i
put
it
heartwork
for
a
family
of
two
what
is
the
matter
with
that
seems
a
bit
cold
to
you
does
it
for
a
real
marriage
proposal
or
is
it
that
it
just
a
bit
too
ardent
perhaps
for
a
mere
plain
business
proposition
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
yes
what
insisted
the
senior
surgeon
yes
flushed
the
white
linen
nurse
very
meditatively
the
senior
surgeon
reconsidered
his
phrasing
heartwork
for
a
family
of
two
u
m
quite
abruptly
even
the
tenseness
of
his
manner
faded
from
him
leaving
his
face
astonishingly
quiet
astonishingly
gentle
but
how
else
miss
malgregor
he
queried
how
else
should
a
widower
with
a
child
proffer
marriage
to
a
to
a
young
girl
like
yourself
even
under
conditions
directly
antipodal
to
ours
such
a
proposition
can
never
be
a
purely
romantic
one
yet
even
under
conditions
as
cold
and
as
ours
there
got
to
be
some
vestige
of
affection
in
it
some
vestige
at
least
of
the
of
affection
else
what
gain
is
there
for
my
little
girl
and
me
over
the
purely
mercenary
domestic
service
that
has
racked
us
up
to
this
time
with
its
garish
faithlessness
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
but
even
if
i
had
loved
you
miss
malgregor
explained
the
senior
surgeon
gravely
my
offer
of
marriage
to
you
would
not
i
fear
have
been
a
very
great
oratorical
success
materialist
as
i
am
cynic
scientist
any
harsh
thing
you
choose
to
call
me
marriage
in
some
freak
boyish
corner
of
my
mind
still
defines
itself
as
being
the
mutual
sharing
of
a
mutually
original
experience
certainly
whether
a
first
marriage
be
instigated
in
love
or
worldliness
whether
it
eventually
proves
itself
bliss
tragedy
or
mere
sickening
ennui
to
two
people
coming
mutually
virgin
to
the
consummation
of
that
marriage
the
thrill
of
establishing
publicly
a
home
together
is
an
emotion
that
can
not
be
reduplicated
while
life
lasts
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
bleakly
across
the
senior
surgeon
face
something
gray
that
was
not
years
shadowed
suddenly
and
was
gone
again
even
so
miss
malgregor
he
argued
even
so
without
any
glittering
romance
whatsoever
no
woman
i
believe
is
very
grossly
unhappy
in
any
affectional
place
that
she
knows
distinctly
to
be
her
place
it
pretty
much
up
to
a
man
then
i
think
though
it
tear
him
brain
from
heart
to
explain
to
a
second
wife
quite
definitely
just
exactly
what
place
it
is
that
he
is
offering
her
in
his
love
or
his
friendship
or
his
mere
desperate
need
no
woman
can
ever
hope
to
step
successfully
into
a
home
who
does
not
know
from
her
own
lips
the
measure
of
her
predecessor
the
respect
we
owe
the
dead
is
a
selfish
thing
compared
to
the
mercy
we
owe
the
living
in
my
own
case
unconsciously
the
white
linen
nurse
lax
shoulders
quickened
and
the
sudden
upward
tilt
of
her
chin
was
as
frankly
interrogative
as
a
french
inflection
yes
sir
she
said
in
my
own
case
said
the
senior
surgeon
bluntly
in
my
own
case
miss
malgregor
it
is
no
more
than
fair
to
tell
you
that
i
did
not
love
my
wife
and
my
wife
did
not
love
me
only
the
muscular
twitch
in
his
throat
betrayed
the
torture
that
the
confession
cost
him
the
details
of
that
marriage
are
unnecessary
he
continued
with
equal
bluntness
it
is
enough
perhaps
to
say
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
an
eminent
surgeon
with
whom
i
was
exceedingly
anxious
at
that
time
to
be
allied
and
that
our
mating
urged
along
on
both
sides
as
it
was
by
strong
personal
ambitions
was
one
of
those
of
which
almost
invariably
turn
out
to
be
marriages
of
such
dire
inconvenience
to
the
two
people
most
concerned
for
one
year
we
lived
together
in
a
chaos
of
experimental
acquaintanceship
for
two
years
we
lived
together
in
increasing
uncongeniality
and
distaste
for
three
years
we
lived
together
in
open
and
acknowledged
enmity
at
the
last
i
am
thankful
to
remember
that
we
had
one
year
together
again
that
was
at
least
an
armed
truce
darkly
the
gray
shadow
and
the
red
flush
chased
each
other
once
more
across
the
man
haggard
face
i
had
a
theory
he
said
that
possibly
a
child
might
bridge
the
chasm
between
us
my
wife
refuted
the
theory
but
submitted
herself
reluctantly
to
the
fact
and
when
she
in
giving
birth
to
my
theory
the
shock
the
remorse
the
regret
the
merciless
that
i
underwent
at
that
time
almost
convinced
me
that
the
whole
miserable
failure
of
our
marriage
lay
entirely
on
my
own
shoulders
like
the
stress
of
the
tears
of
sweat
started
suddenly
on
his
forehead
but
i
am
a
fair
man
i
hope
even
to
myself
and
the
cooler
judgment
of
the
subsequent
years
has
practically
assured
me
that
for
types
as
diametrically
opposed
as
ours
such
a
thing
as
mutual
happiness
never
could
have
existed
mechanically
he
bent
down
and
smoothed
a
tickly
lock
of
hair
away
from
the
little
girl
eyelids
and
the
child
is
the
living
physical
image
of
her
he
stammered
the
violent
hair
the
skin
the
facile
mouth
the
arrogant
eyes
staring
staring
maddeningly
reproachful
persistently
accusing
my
own
stubborn
will
my
own
hideous
temper
all
my
own
mannerisms
mocked
back
at
me
eternally
in
her
mother
unloved
features
mirthless
as
the
grin
of
a
skull
the
senior
surgeon
mouth
twisted
up
a
little
at
one
corner
maybe
i
could
have
borne
it
better
if
she
been
a
boy
he
acknowledged
grimly
but
to
see
all
your
virile
masculine
vices
come
back
at
you
so
sissified
in
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
with
an
unmistakable
gasp
of
relief
the
senior
surgeon
expanded
his
great
chest
there
that
done
he
said
tersely
so
much
for
the
past
now
for
the
present
look
at
us
pretty
keenly
and
judge
for
yourself
a
man
and
a
very
little
girl
not
guaranteed
not
even
recommended
offered
merely
is
in
the
honest
of
the
day
offered
frankly
in
an
open
package
accepted
frankly
if
at
all
your
own
risk
not
for
an
instant
would
i
try
to
deceive
you
about
us
look
at
us
closely
i
ask
and
decide
for
yourself
i
am
years
old
i
am
inexcusably
very
quick
to
anger
and
not
i
fear
of
great
mercy
i
am
moody
i
am
selfish
i
am
most
distinctly
unsocial
but
i
am
not
i
believe
stingy
nor
ever
intentionally
unfair
my
child
is
a
cripple
and
equally
as
myself
no
one
but
a
mercenary
has
ever
coped
with
her
and
she
shows
it
we
have
lived
alone
for
six
years
all
of
our
clothes
and
most
of
our
ways
need
mending
i
am
not
one
to
mince
matters
miss
malgregor
nor
has
your
training
i
trust
made
you
one
from
whom
truths
must
be
veiled
i
am
a
man
with
all
a
man
needs
mental
moral
physical
my
child
is
a
child
with
all
a
child
needs
mental
moral
physical
our
house
of
life
is
full
of
cobwebs
the
rooms
of
affection
have
long
been
closed
there
will
be
a
great
deal
of
work
to
do
and
it
is
not
my
intention
you
see
that
you
should
misunderstand
in
any
conceivable
way
either
the
exact
nature
or
the
exact
amount
of
work
and
worry
involved
i
should
not
want
you
to
come
to
me
afterwards
with
a
whine
as
other
workers
do
and
say
but
i
did
know
you
would
expect
me
to
do
oh
but
i
had
any
idea
you
would
want
me
to
do
and
i
certainly
do
see
why
you
should
expect
me
to
give
up
my
thursday
afternoon
just
because
you
yourself
happened
to
fall
down
stairs
in
the
morning
and
break
your
back
across
the
senior
surgeon
face
a
real
smile
lightened
suddenly
really
miss
malgregor
he
affirmed
i
afraid
there
is
much
of
anything
that
you
wo
be
expected
to
do
and
as
to
your
out
ha
if
you
have
ever
yet
found
a
way
to
temper
the
wind
of
your
obligations
to
the
shorn
lamb
of
your
pleasures
you
have
discovered
something
that
i
myself
have
never
yet
succeeded
in
discovering
and
as
to
yes
i
want
to
talk
everything
quite
frankly
in
addition
to
my
average
yearly
earnings
which
are
by
no
means
small
i
have
a
reasonably
large
private
fortune
within
normal
limits
there
is
no
luxury
i
think
that
you
can
not
hope
to
have
also
exclusive
of
the
independent
income
which
i
would
like
to
settle
upon
you
i
should
be
very
glad
to
finance
for
you
any
reasonable
dreams
that
you
may
cherish
concerning
your
family
in
nova
scotia
also
though
the
offer
looks
small
and
unimportant
to
you
now
it
is
liable
to
loom
pretty
large
to
you
later
also
i
will
personally
guarantee
to
you
at
some
time
every
year
an
unfettered
perfectly
independent
two
months
holiday
so
the
offer
stands
my
and
fame
if
those
mean
anything
to
you
financial
independence
an
assured
spell
for
at
least
two
months
out
of
twelve
and
at
last
but
not
least
my
eternal
gratitude
heartwork
for
a
family
of
two
have
i
made
the
task
perfectly
clear
to
you
not
everything
to
be
done
all
at
once
you
know
but
immediately
where
necessity
urges
it
gradually
as
confidence
inspires
it
ultimately
if
affection
justifies
it
every
womanish
thing
that
needs
to
be
done
in
a
man
and
a
child
neglected
lives
do
you
understand
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
oh
and
there
one
thing
more
confided
the
senior
surgeon
something
of
course
that
i
ought
to
have
told
you
the
very
first
thing
of
all
nervously
he
glanced
down
at
the
sleeping
child
and
lowered
his
voice
to
a
mumbling
monotone
as
regards
my
actual
morals
you
have
naturally
a
right
to
know
that
i
led
a
pretty
decent
sort
of
life
though
i
probably
do
deserve
any
special
credit
for
that
a
man
who
knows
enough
to
be
a
doctor
is
particularly
apt
to
lead
any
other
kind
frankly
as
women
rate
vices
i
believe
i
have
only
one
what
what
i
trying
to
tell
you
now
is
about
that
one
a
little
defiantly
as
to
chin
a
little
appealingly
as
to
eye
he
emptied
his
heart
of
its
last
tragic
secret
through
all
the
male
line
of
my
family
miss
malgregor
dipsomania
runs
rampant
two
of
my
brothers
my
father
my
grandfather
my
great
grandfather
before
him
have
all
gone
down
as
the
temperance
people
would
say
into
graves
in
my
own
case
i
have
chosen
to
compromise
with
the
evil
such
a
choice
believe
me
has
not
been
made
carelessly
or
impulsively
but
out
of
the
agony
and
humiliation
of
several
less
successful
methods
hard
as
a
rock
his
face
grooved
into
its
furrows
again
naturally
under
these
existing
conditions
he
warned
her
almost
threateningly
i
am
not
peculiarly
susceptible
to
the
mawkishly
ignorant
and
sentimental
protests
of
people
whose
strongest
passions
are
an
appetite
for
chocolate
candy
for
eleven
months
of
the
year
he
hurried
on
a
bit
huskily
for
eleven
months
of
the
year
eleven
months
each
day
reeking
from
dawn
to
dark
with
the
driving
work
that
falls
to
my
profession
i
lead
an
absolutely
abstemious
life
touching
neither
wine
nor
liquor
nor
even
indeed
tea
or
coffee
in
the
twelfth
month
june
always
i
go
way
way
up
into
canada
way
way
off
in
the
woods
to
a
little
log
camp
i
own
there
with
an
indian
who
has
guided
me
thus
for
eighteen
years
and
live
like
a
wild
man
for
four
gorgeous
weeks
it
is
what
your
temperance
friends
would
call
a
to
be
quite
frank
i
suppose
it
is
what
anybody
would
call
a
then
the
first
of
july
three
or
four
days
past
the
first
of
july
perhaps
i
come
out
of
the
woods
quite
tame
again
a
little
emotionally
nervous
perhaps
a
little
temperishly
irritable
a
little
unduly
sensitive
about
being
greeted
as
a
returned
but
most
miraculously
purged
of
all
morbid
craving
for
liquor
and
with
every
digital
muscle
as
coolly
steady
as
yours
and
every
conscious
mental
process
clamoring
cleanly
for
its
own
work
again
furtively
under
his
glowering
brows
he
stopped
and
searched
the
white
linen
nurse
imperturbable
face
it
an
established
custom
you
understand
he
rewarned
her
i
not
advocating
it
you
understand
i
not
defending
it
i
simply
calling
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
is
an
established
custom
if
you
decide
to
come
to
us
i
i
could
you
know
at
begin
all
over
again
to
to
have
some
one
waiting
for
me
on
the
top
step
the
first
of
july
to
tell
me
what
a
low
beast
i
am
till
i
go
down
the
steps
again
the
following
june
no
of
course
not
conceded
the
white
linen
nurse
blandly
she
lifted
her
lovely
eyes
to
his
father
like
that
she
confided
amiably
once
a
year
just
easter
sunday
only
he
always
buys
him
a
brand
new
suit
of
clothes
and
goes
to
church
and
it
does
something
to
him
i
do
know
exactly
what
but
easter
afternoon
he
always
gets
drunk
oh
mad
fighting
drunk
is
what
i
mean
and
goes
out
and
tries
to
tear
up
the
whole
county
worriedly
two
black
thoughts
puckered
between
her
eyebrows
and
always
she
said
he
makes
mother
and
me
go
up
to
halifax
beforehand
to
pick
out
the
suit
for
him
it
pretty
hard
sometimes
she
said
to
find
anything
dressy
enough
for
the
morning
that
serviceable
enough
for
the
afternoon
eh
jerked
the
senior
surgeon
then
suddenly
he
began
to
smile
again
like
a
stormy
sky
from
which
the
last
cloud
has
just
been
cleared
well
it
all
right
then
is
it
you
take
us
he
asked
brightly
oh
no
said
the
white
linen
nurse
oh
no
sir
oh
no
indeed
sir
quite
perceptibly
she
jerked
her
way
backward
a
little
on
the
grass
thank
you
very
much
she
persisted
courteously
it
been
very
interesting
i
thank
you
very
much
for
telling
me
but
but
what
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
but
it
too
quick
said
the
white
linen
nurse
no
man
could
tell
like
that
just
between
one
and
another
what
he
wanted
about
anything
let
alone
marrying
a
perfect
stranger
instantly
the
senior
surgeon
bridled
i
assure
you
my
dear
young
lady
he
retorted
that
i
am
entirely
and
completely
accustomed
to
deciding
between
wink
and
another
just
exactly
what
it
is
that
i
want
indeed
i
assure
you
that
there
are
a
good
many
people
living
who
would
be
living
if
it
had
taken
me
even
as
long
as
a
wink
and
to
make
up
my
mind
yes
i
know
sir
acknowledged
the
white
linen
nurse
yes
of
course
sir
she
acquiesced
with
most
commendable
humility
but
all
the
same
sir
i
could
do
it
she
persisted
with
inflexible
positiveness
why
i
have
enough
education
she
confessed
quite
shamelessly
you
had
enough
i
notice
to
get
into
the
hospital
drawled
the
senior
surgeon
a
bit
grumpily
and
that
quite
as
much
as
most
people
have
i
assure
you
high
school
education
or
its
equivalent
that
is
the
hospital
requirement
i
believe
he
questioned
tartly
high
school
education
or
its
equivocation
is
what
we
girls
call
it
confessed
the
white
linen
nurse
demurely
but
even
so
sir
she
pleaded
it
is
just
my
lack
of
education
it
my
brains
i
tell
you
sir
i
have
got
enough
brains
to
do
what
you
suggest
i
do
mean
at
all
to
belittle
your
brains
grinned
the
senior
surgeon
in
spite
of
himself
oh
not
at
all
miss
malgregor
but
you
see
it
is
especially
brains
that
i
looking
for
really
what
i
need
most
he
acknowledged
frankly
is
an
extra
pair
of
hands
to
go
with
the
brains
i
already
possess
yes
i
know
sir
persisted
the
white
linen
nurse
yes
of
course
sir
she
conceded
yes
of
course
sir
my
hands
work
awfully
well
with
your
face
but
all
the
same
she
kindled
suddenly
all
the
same
sir
i
ca
i
wo
i
tell
you
sir
i
wo
why
i
not
in
your
world
sir
why
i
not
in
your
class
why
my
folks
are
like
your
folks
oh
we
just
as
good
as
you
of
course
but
we
are
as
nice
oh
we
not
nice
at
all
really
and
truly
we
not
desperately
through
her
mind
she
rummaged
up
and
down
for
some
one
conclusive
fact
that
would
close
this
torturing
argument
for
all
time
why
my
father
eats
with
his
knife
she
asserted
triumphantly
would
he
be
apt
to
eat
with
mine
asked
the
senior
surgeon
with
extravagant
gravity
precipitously
the
white
linen
nurse
jumped
to
the
defense
of
her
father
intrinsic
honor
oh
no
she
denied
with
some
vehemence
father
never
cheeky
like
that
father
simple
sometimes
plain
i
mean
or
he
might
be
a
bit
sharp
but
oh
i
sure
he
never
be
cheeky
oh
no
sir
no
oh
very
well
then
grinned
the
senior
surgeon
we
can
consider
everything
all
comfortably
settled
then
i
suppose
no
we
ca
screamed
the
white
linen
nurse
a
little
awkwardly
with
cramped
limbs
she
struggled
partly
upward
from
the
grass
and
knelt
there
defying
the
senior
surgeon
from
her
temporarily
superior
height
no
we
ca
she
reiterated
wildly
i
tell
you
i
ca
sir
i
wo
i
wo
i
been
engaged
once
and
it
enough
i
tell
you
sir
i
all
engaged
out
what
become
of
the
man
you
were
engaged
to
quizzed
the
senior
surgeon
sharply
why
he
married
said
the
white
linen
nurse
and
they
got
a
kid
she
added
tempestuously
good
i
glad
of
it
smiled
the
senior
surgeon
quite
amazingly
now
he
surely
wo
bother
us
any
more
but
i
was
engaged
so
long
protested
the
white
linen
nurse
almost
ever
since
i
was
born
i
said
it
too
long
you
do
get
over
it
he
got
over
it
remarked
the
senior
surgeon
laconically
admitted
the
white
linen
nurse
but
i
tell
you
it
does
seem
decent
not
after
being
engaged
twenty
years
with
a
little
helpless
gesture
of
appeal
she
threw
out
her
hands
oh
ca
i
make
you
understand
sir
why
of
course
i
understand
said
the
senior
surgeon
briskly
you
mean
that
you
and
john
his
name
was
corrected
the
white
linen
nurse
with
astonishing
amiability
the
senior
surgeon
acknowledged
the
correction
you
mean
he
said
you
mean
that
you
and
joe
have
been
cradled
together
so
familiarly
all
your
babyhood
that
on
your
wedding
night
you
could
most
naturally
have
said
me
see
joe
it
two
pillows
that
you
always
have
is
it
and
a
of
blanket
at
the
foot
you
mean
that
you
and
joe
have
been
washed
and
scrubbed
together
so
familiarly
all
your
young
childhood
that
you
could
identify
joe
headless
body
twenty
years
hence
by
the
scar
across
his
back
you
mean
that
you
and
joe
have
played
house
together
so
familiarly
all
your
young
days
that
even
your
rag
dolls
called
joe
you
mean
that
since
your
earliest
memory
until
a
year
or
so
ago
life
has
never
once
been
just
you
and
life
but
always
you
and
life
and
joe
you
and
spring
and
joe
you
and
summer
and
joe
you
and
autumn
and
joe
you
and
winter
and
joe
till
every
conscious
nerve
in
your
body
has
been
so
everlastingly
joed
with
joe
joeness
that
you
do
believe
there
any
experience
left
in
life
powerful
enough
to
eradicate
that
original
impression
eh
yes
sir
flushed
the
white
linen
nurse
good
i
glad
of
it
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
it
does
make
you
seem
quite
so
alarmingly
innocent
and
remote
for
a
widower
to
offer
marriage
to
good
i
say
i
glad
of
it
even
so
i
do
want
to
said
the
white
linen
nurse
thank
you
very
much
sir
but
even
so
i
do
want
to
would
you
marry
joe
now
if
he
were
suddenly
free
and
wanted
you
asked
the
senior
surgeon
bluntly
oh
my
lord
no
said
the
white
linen
nurse
other
men
are
pretty
sure
to
want
you
admonished
the
senior
surgeon
have
you
made
up
your
mind
definitely
that
you
never
marry
anybody
n
o
not
exactly
confessed
the
white
linen
nurse
an
odd
flicker
twitched
across
the
senior
surgeon
face
like
a
sob
in
the
brain
what
your
first
name
miss
malgregor
he
asked
a
bit
huskily
rae
she
told
him
with
some
surprise
the
senior
surgeon
eyes
narrowed
suddenly
again
damn
it
all
rae
he
said
want
you
precipitously
the
white
linen
nurse
scrambled
to
her
feet
if
you
mind
sir
she
cried
i
run
down
to
the
brook
and
get
myself
a
drink
of
water
impishly
like
a
child
muscularly
like
a
man
the
senior
surgeon
clutched
out
at
the
flapping
corner
of
her
coat
no
you
do
he
laughed
till
you
given
me
my
definite
answer
yes
or
no
breathlessly
the
white
linen
nurse
spun
round
in
her
tracks
her
breast
was
heaving
with
sobs
her
eyes
were
blurred
with
tears
you
no
business
to
hurry
me
so
she
protested
passionately
it
is
fair
it
is
kind
sluggishly
in
the
senior
surgeon
jolted
arms
the
little
girl
woke
from
her
feverish
nap
and
peered
up
perplexedly
through
the
gray
dusk
into
her
father
face
where
my
kitty
she
asked
hazily
eh
jerked
the
senior
surgeon
harshly
the
little
iron
clanked
together
in
an
instant
the
white
linen
nurse
was
on
her
knees
in
the
grass
you
do
hold
her
right
sir
she
expostulated
deftly
with
little
soft
darting
touches
interrupted
only
by
rubbing
her
knuckles
into
her
own
tears
she
reached
out
and
eased
successively
the
bruise
of
a
buckle
or
the
dragging
weight
on
a
little
cramped
hip
still
drowsily
still
hazily
with
little
smacking
gasps
and
gulping
swallows
the
child
worried
her
way
back
again
into
consciousness
all
the
birds
there
father
she
droned
forth
feebly
from
her
sweltering
nest
all
the
birds
there
with
yellow
feathers
instead
of
hair
and
bumble
bees
and
bumble
bees
and
bumble
bees
and
bumble
bees
frenziedly
she
began
to
burrow
the
back
of
her
head
into
her
shoulder
and
bumble
bees
and
bumble
bees
oh
for
heaven
sake
in
the
trees
interpolated
the
senior
surgeon
rigidly
from
head
to
foot
the
little
body
in
his
arms
stiffened
suddenly
as
one
who
saw
the
supreme
achievement
of
a
swept
away
by
some
one
careless
joggle
of
an
infinitesimal
part
the
little
girl
stared
up
agonizingly
into
her
father
face
oh
i
think
was
the
word
she
began
convulsively
oh
i
think
startlingly
through
the
twilight
the
senior
surgeon
felt
the
white
linen
nurse
lips
come
smack
against
his
ear
darn
you
ca
you
say
in
the
trees
sobbed
the
white
linen
nurse
grotesquely
for
an
instant
the
senior
surgeon
eyes
and
the
white
linen
nurse
eyes
glared
at
each
other
in
frank
antagonism
then
suddenly
the
senior
surgeon
burst
out
laughing
oh
very
well
he
surrendered
in
the
trees
precipitously
the
white
linen
nurse
sank
back
on
her
heels
and
began
to
clap
her
hands
oh
now
i
will
now
i
will
she
cried
exultantly
will
what
frowned
the
senior
surgeon
abruptly
the
white
linen
nurse
stopped
clapping
her
hands
and
began
to
wring
them
nervously
in
her
lap
instead
why
will
will
she
confessed
demurely
oh
jumped
the
senior
surgeon
then
equally
jerkily
he
began
to
pucker
his
eyebrows
but
for
heaven
sake
what
the
in
the
trees
got
to
do
with
it
he
asked
perplexedly
nothing
much
mused
the
white
linen
nurse
very
softly
with
sudden
alertness
she
turned
her
curly
blonde
head
towards
the
road
somebody
coming
she
said
i
hear
a
team
overcome
by
a
bashfulness
that
tried
to
escape
in
jocosity
the
senior
surgeon
gave
an
odd
little
choking
chuckle
well
i
never
thought
i
should
marry
a
trained
nurse
he
acknowledged
with
somewhat
hectic
blitheness
impulsively
the
white
linen
nurse
reached
for
her
watch
and
lifted
it
close
to
her
eyes
a
sense
of
ineffable
peace
crept
suddenly
over
her
you
wo
sir
she
said
amiably
it
twenty
minutes
of
nine
now
and
the
graduation
was
at
eight
chapter
viii
for
any
real
adventure
except
dying
june
is
certainly
a
most
auspicious
month
indeed
it
was
on
the
very
first
morning
of
june
that
the
white
linen
nurse
sallied
forth
upon
her
extremely
hazardous
adventure
of
marrying
the
senior
surgeon
and
his
naughty
little
crippled
daughter
the
wedding
was
at
noon
in
some
kind
of
a
gray
granite
church
and
the
senior
surgeon
was
there
of
course
and
the
necessary
witnesses
but
the
little
crippled
girl
never
turned
up
at
all
owing
it
proved
later
to
a
more
than
usually
violent
wrangle
with
whomever
dressed
her
concerning
the
general
advisability
of
sporting
stockings
with
her
brightest
little
purple
dress
the
senior
surgeon
stockings
if
you
really
care
to
know
were
gray
and
the
senior
surgeon
suit
was
gray
and
he
looked
altogether
very
huge
and
distinguished
and
no
more
strikingly
unhappy
than
any
bridegroom
looks
in
a
gray
granite
church
and
the
white
linen
nurse
no
longer
now
truly
a
white
linen
nurse
but
just
an
ordinary
lady
of
any
color
she
chose
wore
something
rather
and
grand
and
bluish
and
was
distractingly
pretty
of
course
but
most
essentially
unfamiliar
and
just
a
tiny
bit
awkward
and
looking
as
even
an
admiral
is
apt
to
be
on
his
first
day
out
of
uniform
then
as
soon
as
the
wedding
ceremony
was
over
the
bride
and
groom
went
to
a
wonderful
green
and
gold
caf√©
all
built
of
marble
and
lined
with
music
and
had
a
little
lunch
what
i
really
mean
of
course
is
that
they
had
a
very
large
lunch
but
did
eat
any
of
it
then
in
a
just
exactly
like
any
other
the
white
linen
nurse
drove
home
alone
to
the
senior
surgeon
great
gloomy
house
to
find
her
brand
new
still
screaming
over
the
turquoise
colored
stockings
and
the
senior
surgeon
in
a
train
just
exactly
like
any
other
train
started
off
alone
as
usual
on
his
annual
june
spree
please
do
think
for
a
moment
that
it
was
the
senior
surgeon
who
was
responsible
for
the
general
eccentricities
of
this
amazing
wedding
day
no
indeed
the
senior
surgeon
did
to
be
married
the
first
day
of
june
he
he
did
he
he
did
he
he
did
he
he
did
and
when
he
finished
saying
and
growling
and
snarling
and
swearing
and
looked
up
at
the
white
linen
nurse
for
a
confirmation
of
his
opinion
the
white
linen
nurse
smiled
perfectly
amiably
and
said
yes
sir
then
the
senior
surgeon
gave
a
great
gasp
of
relief
and
announced
resonantly
well
it
all
settled
then
we
be
married
some
time
in
july
after
i
get
home
from
canada
and
when
the
white
linen
nurse
kept
on
smiling
perfectly
amiably
and
said
oh
no
sir
oh
no
thank
you
sir
it
would
seem
exactly
legal
to
me
to
be
married
any
other
month
but
june
then
the
senior
surgeon
went
absolutely
dumb
with
rage
that
this
mere
chit
of
a
girl
and
a
trained
nurse
too
should
dare
to
thwart
his
personal
and
professional
convenience
but
the
white
linen
nurse
just
drooped
her
pretty
blonde
head
and
blushed
and
blushed
and
blushed
and
said
i
was
only
marrying
you
sir
to
accommodate
you
sir
and
if
june
does
accommodate
you
i
rather
go
to
japan
with
that
monoideic
somnambulism
case
it
very
interesting
and
it
sails
june
second
then
oh
hell
with
the
somnambulism
case
the
senior
surgeon
would
protest
really
it
took
the
senior
surgeon
quite
a
long
while
to
work
out
the
three
special
arguments
that
should
best
protect
him
he
thought
from
the
horridly
embarrassing
idea
of
being
married
in
june
but
you
ca
get
ready
so
soon
he
suggested
at
last
with
real
triumph
you
no
idea
how
long
it
takes
a
girl
to
get
ready
to
be
married
there
are
so
many
people
she
has
to
tell
and
everything
there
never
but
two
that
she
got
to
tell
or
bust
conceded
the
white
linen
nurse
with
perfect
candor
just
the
woman
she
loves
the
most
and
the
woman
she
hates
the
worst
i
write
my
mother
but
i
told
the
superintendent
of
nurses
yesterday
the
deuce
you
did
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
almost
caressingly
the
white
linen
nurse
lifted
her
big
blue
eyes
to
his
yes
sir
she
said
and
she
looked
as
sick
as
a
young
undertaker
i
ca
imagine
what
ailed
her
eh
choked
the
senior
surgeon
but
the
house
now
he
hastened
to
contend
the
house
now
needs
a
lot
of
fixing
over
it
all
run
down
it
all
everything
we
never
in
the
world
could
get
it
into
shape
by
the
first
of
june
for
heaven
sake
now
that
we
got
money
enough
to
make
it
right
let
go
slow
and
make
it
perfectly
right
a
little
nervously
the
white
linen
nurse
began
to
fumble
through
the
pages
of
her
memorandum
book
i
always
had
money
enough
to
slow
and
make
things
perfectly
right
she
confided
a
bit
wistfully
never
in
all
my
life
have
i
had
a
pair
of
boots
that
were
guaranteed
or
a
dress
that
would
wash
or
a
hat
that
was
worth
at
least
three
what
i
was
hoping
for
now
sir
was
that
i
was
going
to
have
enough
money
so
that
i
could
go
fast
and
make
things
wrong
if
i
wanted
to
so
that
i
could
afford
to
take
chances
i
mean
here
this
now
tragically
she
pointed
to
some
figuring
in
her
it
got
peacocks
on
it
life
size
in
a
queen
garden
and
i
wanted
it
for
the
maybe
it
would
fade
maybe
we
get
tired
of
it
maybe
it
would
poison
us
slam
it
on
one
week
and
slash
it
off
the
next
i
wanted
it
just
because
i
wanted
it
sir
i
thought
maybe
while
you
were
way
off
in
canada
eagerly
the
senior
surgeon
jerked
his
chair
a
little
nearer
to
his
fianc√©e
now
my
dear
girl
he
said
that
just
what
i
want
to
explain
that
just
what
i
want
to
explain
just
what
i
want
to
explain
to
er
explain
he
continued
a
bit
falteringly
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
very
deliberately
the
senior
surgeon
removed
a
fleck
of
dust
from
one
of
his
cuffs
all
this
talk
of
yours
about
wanting
to
be
married
the
same
day
i
start
off
on
my
canadian
trip
he
contended
why
it
all
damned
nonsense
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
very
conscientiously
the
senior
surgeon
began
to
search
for
a
fleck
of
dust
on
his
other
cuff
why
my
my
dear
girl
he
persisted
it
absurd
it
outrageous
why
people
would
would
hoot
at
us
why
they
think
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
why
my
dear
girl
sweated
the
senior
surgeon
even
though
you
and
i
understand
perfectly
well
the
purely
formal
conditions
of
our
marriage
we
must
at
least
for
sheer
decency
sake
keep
up
a
certain
semblance
of
marital
conventionality
before
the
world
why
if
we
were
married
at
noon
the
first
day
of
june
as
you
suggest
and
i
should
go
right
off
alone
as
usual
on
my
canadian
trip
and
you
should
come
back
alone
to
the
house
why
people
would
think
would
think
that
i
did
care
anything
about
you
but
you
do
said
the
white
linen
nurse
serenely
why
they
think
choked
the
senior
surgeon
they
think
you
were
trying
your
darndest
to
get
rid
of
me
i
am
said
the
white
linen
nurse
complacently
with
a
muttered
ejaculation
the
senior
surgeon
jumped
to
his
feet
and
stood
glaring
down
at
her
quite
ingenuously
the
white
linen
nurse
met
and
parried
the
glare
a
gentleman
and
a
kiddie
and
a
great
walloping
house
all
at
once
it
too
much
she
confided
genially
thank
you
just
the
same
but
i
rather
take
them
gradually
first
of
all
sir
you
see
i
got
to
teach
the
little
kiddie
to
like
me
and
then
there
a
paper
with
floppity
sea
gulls
on
it
that
i
want
to
try
for
the
and
and
ecstatically
she
clapped
her
hands
together
oh
sir
there
are
such
loads
and
loads
of
experiments
i
want
to
try
while
you
are
off
on
your
spree
s
h
h
cried
the
senior
surgeon
his
face
was
suddenly
blanched
his
mouth
twitching
like
the
mouth
of
one
stricken
with
almost
insupportable
pain
for
god
sake
miss
malgregor
he
pleaded
ca
you
call
it
my
canadian
trip
wider
and
wider
the
white
linen
nurse
opened
her
big
blue
eyes
at
him
but
it
is
a
sir
she
attested
resolutely
and
my
father
says
still
resolutely
her
young
mouth
curved
to
its
original
assertion
but
from
under
her
eyelashes
a
little
blue
smile
crept
softly
out
when
my
father
got
a
lame
trotting
horse
sir
that
he
trying
to
shuck
off
his
hands
she
faltered
he
ever
go
round
with
his
head
hanging
telling
folks
about
his
wonderful
trotter
that
just
littlest
teeniest
tiniest
bit
lame
oh
no
what
father
does
is
to
call
up
every
one
he
knows
within
twenty
miles
and
tell
tom
bill
harry
or
whatever
his
name
is
in
the
deuce
do
you
suppose
i
got
over
here
in
my
barn
a
lame
horse
that
wants
to
trot
lamer
than
the
deuce
you
know
but
can
do
a
mile
in
faintly
the
little
blue
smile
quickened
again
in
the
white
linen
nurse
eyes
and
the
barn
will
be
full
of
men
in
half
an
hour
she
said
somehow
nobody
wants
a
trotter
that
lame
but
almost
anybody
seems
willing
to
risk
a
lame
horse
that
plucky
enough
to
trot
what
the
trotting
horse
got
to
do
with
me
snarled
the
senior
surgeon
incisively
darkly
the
white
linen
nurse
lashes
fringed
down
across
her
cheeks
nothing
much
she
said
only
only
what
demanded
the
senior
surgeon
a
little
more
roughly
than
he
realized
he
stooped
down
and
took
the
white
linen
nurse
by
her
shoulders
and
jerked
her
sharply
round
to
the
light
only
he
insisted
peremptorily
almost
plaintively
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
only
my
father
says
she
confided
obediently
my
father
says
if
you
got
a
worse
foot
for
heaven
sake
put
it
forward
and
get
it
over
with
so
i
to
call
it
a
smiled
the
white
linen
nurse
when
i
think
of
marrying
a
that
goes
off
and
gets
drunk
every
june
it
it
scares
me
almost
to
my
death
but
abruptly
the
red
smile
faded
from
her
lips
the
blue
smile
from
her
eyes
but
when
i
think
of
marrying
a
june
drunk
that
got
the
grit
to
pull
up
absolutely
straight
as
a
die
and
be
a
all
the
other
months
in
the
year
dartingly
she
bent
down
and
kissed
the
senior
surgeon
astonished
wrist
oh
then
i
think
you
perfectly
she
sobbed
awkwardly
the
senior
surgeon
pulled
away
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
you
a
good
little
girl
rae
malgregor
he
mumbled
huskily
a
good
little
girl
i
truly
believe
you
the
kind
that
will
see
me
through
poignantly
in
his
eyes
humiliation
overwhelmed
the
mist
perversely
in
its
turn
resentment
overtook
the
humiliation
but
i
wo
be
married
in
june
he
reasserted
bombastically
i
wo
i
wo
i
wo
i
tell
you
i
positively
refuse
to
have
a
lot
of
damn
fools
speculating
about
my
private
affairs
wondering
why
i
did
take
you
wondering
why
i
stay
home
with
you
i
tell
you
i
wo
i
simply
wo
yes
sir
stammered
the
white
linen
nurse
with
a
real
gasp
of
relief
the
senior
surgeon
stopped
his
eternal
pacing
of
the
floor
bully
for
you
he
said
you
mean
then
we
be
married
some
time
in
july
after
i
get
back
from
my
trip
oh
no
sir
stammered
the
white
linen
nurse
but
great
heavens
shouted
the
senior
surgeon
yes
sir
the
white
linen
nurse
began
all
over
again
dreamily
planning
out
her
wedding
gown
her
lips
without
the
slightest
conscious
effort
on
her
part
were
already
curving
into
shape
for
her
alternate
no
sir
you
an
idiot
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
a
little
reproachfully
the
white
linen
nurse
came
frowning
out
of
her
reverie
would
it
do
just
as
well
for
traveling
do
you
think
she
asked
with
real
concern
eh
what
said
the
senior
surgeon
i
mean
does
japan
spot
queried
the
white
linen
nurse
would
it
spot
a
serge
i
mean
oh
hell
with
japan
jerked
the
senior
surgeon
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
now
perhaps
you
will
understand
just
exactly
how
it
happened
that
the
senior
surgeon
and
the
white
linen
nurse
married
on
the
first
day
of
june
and
just
exactly
how
it
happened
that
the
senior
surgeon
went
off
alone
as
usual
on
his
canadian
trip
and
just
exactly
how
it
happened
that
the
white
linen
nurse
came
home
alone
to
the
senior
surgeon
great
gloomy
house
to
find
her
brand
new
still
screaming
over
the
stockings
everything
now
is
perfectly
comfortably
explained
except
the
stockings
nobody
could
explain
the
stockings
but
even
a
little
child
could
explain
the
ensuing
june
oh
june
was
perfectly
wonderful
that
year
bud
blossom
breeze
rioting
headlong
through
the
land
warm
days
sweet
and
lush
as
a
vapor
crisp
nights
faintly
metallic
like
the
scent
of
stars
romping
tunefully
on
every
even
the
flushing
frankly
pink
across
his
dusty
like
two
fairies
who
had
sublet
a
giant
cave
the
white
linen
nurse
and
the
little
crippled
girl
turned
themselves
loose
upon
the
senior
surgeon
gloomy
old
house
it
certainly
was
a
gloomy
old
house
but
handsome
withal
square
and
brown
and
substantial
and
most
generously
gardened
within
high
brick
walls
except
for
dusting
the
lilac
bushes
with
the
hose
and
weeding
a
few
rusty
leaves
out
of
the
privet
hedge
and
tacking
up
three
or
four
scraggly
sprays
of
english
ivy
and
one
or
two
boxes
there
was
really
nothing
much
to
do
to
the
garden
but
the
house
oh
ye
gods
all
day
long
from
morning
till
night
but
most
particularly
from
the
back
door
to
the
barn
sweating
workmen
scuttled
back
and
forth
till
nary
a
guilty
piece
of
black
walnut
furniture
had
escaped
all
day
long
from
morning
till
night
but
most
particularly
from
ceilings
to
floors
sweltering
workmen
scurried
up
and
down
stripping
dingy
papers
from
dingier
plasterings
when
the
white
linen
nurse
was
busy
renovating
the
big
house
or
the
little
she
was
writing
to
the
senior
surgeon
she
wrote
twice
dear
faber
the
first
letter
said
dear
faber
how
do
you
do
thank
you
very
much
for
saying
you
did
care
what
in
thunder
i
did
to
the
house
it
looks
i
put
white
fluttery
muslin
curtains
most
everywhere
and
you
got
a
new
bed
in
your
room
and
the
kiddie
and
i
have
fixed
up
the
most
scrumptious
light
blue
suite
for
ourselves
in
the
ell
pink
was
wrong
for
the
front
hall
but
it
cost
me
only
to
find
out
and
now
that
settled
for
all
time
i
am
very
very
very
very
busy
something
strange
and
new
happens
every
day
yesterday
it
was
three
ladies
and
a
plumber
one
of
the
ladies
was
just
selling
soap
but
i
did
buy
any
it
was
horrid
soap
the
other
two
were
calling
ladies
a
silk
one
and
a
velvet
one
the
silk
one
tried
to
be
nasty
to
me
right
to
my
face
she
told
me
i
was
more
of
a
lady
than
she
had
dared
to
hope
and
i
told
her
i
was
sorry
for
that
as
you
had
one
lady
and
it
did
work
was
that
all
right
but
the
other
lady
was
nice
and
i
took
her
out
in
the
kitchen
with
me
while
i
was
painting
the
woodwork
and
right
there
in
her
white
kid
gloves
she
laughed
and
showed
me
how
to
mix
the
paint
pearl
gray
was
nice
it
was
your
i
like
being
married
faber
i
like
it
lots
better
than
i
thought
i
would
it
fun
being
the
biggest
person
in
the
house
respectfully
yours
rae
malgregor
as
was
oh
i
hope
it
was
wrong
but
in
your
ulster
pocket
when
i
went
to
put
it
away
i
found
a
bottle
of
something
that
smelt
as
though
it
had
been
i
threw
it
out
it
was
this
letter
that
drew
the
only
definite
message
from
the
itinerant
bridegroom
kindly
refrain
from
rummaging
in
my
ulster
pockets
wrote
the
senior
surgeon
quite
briefly
the
you
threw
out
happened
to
be
the
cerebellum
and
medulla
of
an
extremely
eminent
english
theologian
even
so
it
was
sour
telegraphed
the
white
linen
nurse
in
a
perfect
agony
of
remorse
and
humiliation
the
telegram
took
an
indian
with
a
birch
canoe
two
days
to
deliver
and
cost
the
senior
surgeon
twelve
dollars
just
impulsively
the
senior
surgeon
decided
to
make
no
further
comments
on
domestic
affairs
at
that
particular
range
very
fortunately
for
this
impulse
the
white
linen
nurse
second
letter
concerned
itself
almost
entirely
with
matters
quite
extraneous
to
the
home
dear
faber
the
second
letter
ran
dear
faber
somehow
i
do
seem
to
care
so
much
just
now
about
being
the
biggest
person
in
the
house
something
awful
has
happened
zillah
forsyth
is
dead
really
dead
i
mean
and
she
died
in
great
heroism
you
remember
zillah
forsyth
do
you
she
was
one
of
my
not
the
gooder
one
you
know
not
the
swell
that
was
helene
churchill
but
zillah
oh
you
know
zillah
was
the
one
you
sent
out
on
that
fractured
elbow
case
it
was
a
yale
student
you
remember
and
there
was
some
trouble
about
kissing
and
she
got
sent
home
and
now
everybody
crying
because
zillah
kiss
anybody
any
more
is
everything
the
limit
well
it
was
a
fractured
yale
student
she
got
sent
out
on
this
time
if
it
had
been
she
might
have
been
living
yet
what
they
sent
her
out
on
this
time
was
a
senile
dementia
an
old
lady
more
than
eighty
years
old
and
they
were
in
a
sanitarium
or
something
like
that
and
there
was
a
fire
in
the
night
and
the
old
lady
just
up
and
positively
refused
to
escape
and
zillah
had
to
push
her
and
shove
her
and
yank
her
and
carry
her
out
the
window
along
the
gutters
round
the
chimneys
and
the
old
lady
bit
zillah
right
through
the
hand
but
zillah
let
go
and
the
old
lady
tried
to
drown
zillah
under
a
bursted
water
tank
but
zillah
would
let
go
and
everybody
hollered
to
zillah
to
cut
loose
and
save
herself
but
zillah
would
let
go
and
a
wall
fell
and
everything
and
oh
it
was
awful
but
zillah
never
let
go
and
the
old
lady
that
was
any
good
to
any
one
not
even
herself
got
saved
of
course
but
zillah
oh
zillah
got
hurt
bad
sir
we
saw
her
at
the
hospital
helene
and
i
she
sent
for
us
about
something
oh
it
was
awful
not
a
thing
about
her
that
you
know
except
just
her
great
solemn
eyes
mooning
out
at
you
through
a
gob
of
white
cotton
and
her
red
mouth
lipping
sort
of
twitchy
at
the
edge
of
a
bandage
oh
it
was
awful
but
zillah
did
seem
to
care
so
much
there
was
a
new
interne
there
a
japanese
and
i
guess
she
was
sort
of
taken
with
him
but
my
god
zillah
i
said
life
was
worth
more
than
that
old
dame
shut
your
noise
says
zillah
it
was
my
job
and
there
no
kick
coming
helene
burst
right
out
crying
she
did
shut
noise
too
says
zillah
just
as
cool
as
you
please
bah
there
other
lives
and
other
chances
oh
you
do
believe
that
now
cries
helene
oh
you
do
believe
that
now
what
the
bible
promises
you
that
was
when
zillah
shrugged
her
shoulders
so
funny
the
little
way
she
had
gee
but
her
eyes
were
big
i
do
pretend
to
know
what
your
old
bible
says
she
choked
it
was
the
yale
feller
who
was
tellin
me
that
all
faber
it
was
her
shrugging
her
shoulders
so
funny
that
brought
on
the
hemorrhage
oh
we
had
an
awful
time
sir
going
home
in
the
carriage
helene
and
i
we
both
cried
of
course
because
zillah
was
dead
but
after
we
got
through
crying
for
that
helene
kept
right
on
crying
because
she
could
understand
why
a
brave
girl
like
zillah
to
be
dead
gee
but
helene
takes
things
hard
ladies
do
i
guess
i
hope
you
having
a
pleasant
spree
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
one
of
the
is
living
here
at
the
house
with
us
just
now
we
use
him
so
much
it
truly
a
good
deal
more
convenient
and
he
a
real
nice
young
fellow
and
he
plays
the
piano
finely
and
he
comes
from
up
my
way
and
it
seemed
more
neighborly
anyway
it
so
large
in
the
house
at
night
just
now
and
so
creaky
in
the
garden
with
kindest
regards
for
now
from
rae
do
tell
your
guide
or
one
but
helene
sent
zillah
mother
a
check
for
fifteen
hundred
dollars
i
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
and
all
zillah
asked
for
that
day
was
just
a
little
blue
serge
suit
it
seems
she
promised
her
kid
sister
a
little
blue
serge
suit
for
july
and
it
sort
of
worried
her
helene
sent
the
little
blue
serge
suit
too
and
a
hat
the
hat
had
bluebells
on
it
do
you
think
when
you
come
home
if
i
have
spent
too
much
money
on
that
i
could
have
a
blue
hat
with
bluebells
on
it
excuse
me
for
bothering
you
but
you
forgot
to
leave
me
enough
money
it
was
some
indefinite
pleasant
time
on
thursday
the
of
june
that
the
senior
surgeon
received
this
second
letter
it
was
friday
the
of
june
exactly
at
dawn
that
the
senior
surgeon
started
homeward
nobody
looks
very
well
in
the
dawn
certainly
the
senior
surgeon
did
heavily
as
a
man
wading
through
a
bog
of
dreams
he
stumbled
out
of
his
cabin
into
the
morning
under
his
drowsy
brooding
eyes
appalling
shadows
circled
behind
his
sunburn
deeper
than
his
tan
something
sinister
and
uncanny
lurked
wanly
like
the
pallor
of
a
soul
yet
the
senior
surgeon
had
been
most
blamelessly
abed
and
asleep
since
time
the
previous
evening
only
the
mountains
and
the
forest
and
the
lake
had
been
out
all
night
for
seventy
miles
of
canadian
wilderness
only
the
mountains
and
the
forest
and
the
lake
stood
actually
convicted
of
having
been
out
all
night
dank
and
white
with
its
vaporous
vigil
the
listless
lake
kindled
wanly
to
the
new
day
breeze
blue
with
cold
a
precipitous
mountain
peak
lurched
craggedly
home
through
a
rift
in
the
fog
drenched
with
mist
bedraggled
with
dew
a
pine
tree
lay
guzzling
insatiably
at
a
pool
monotonous
as
a
sob
the
waiting
birch
canoe
against
the
beach
there
was
no
romantic
smell
of
red
roses
in
this
june
landscape
just
tobacco
smoke
and
the
faint
reminiscent
fragrance
of
fried
trout
and
the
mournful
sizzling
pungent
consciousness
of
a
quenched
for
a
whole
year
with
a
tinful
of
wet
coffee
grounds
gliding
out
cautiously
into
the
lake
as
though
the
mere
splash
of
a
paddle
might
shatter
the
whole
glassy
surface
the
indian
guide
propounded
the
question
that
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
cutting
your
trip
a
bit
short
this
year
ai
you
boss
quizzed
the
indian
guide
out
from
his
muffling
mackinaw
collar
the
senior
surgeon
parried
the
question
with
an
amazingly
novel
sense
of
embarrassment
oh
i
do
know
he
answered
with
studied
lightness
there
are
one
or
two
things
at
home
that
are
bothering
me
a
little
a
woman
eh
said
the
indian
guide
laconically
a
woman
thundered
the
senior
surgeon
a
woman
oh
ye
gods
no
it
wall
paper
then
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
in
the
midst
of
his
passionate
refutation
the
senior
surgeon
burst
out
laughing
boisterously
hilariously
like
a
crazy
bluntly
from
an
overhanging
ledge
of
rock
the
echo
of
his
laugh
came
mocking
back
at
him
down
from
some
unvisioned
mountain
fastness
the
echo
of
that
echo
came
wafting
faintly
to
him
the
senior
surgeon
laugh
was
made
of
teeth
and
tongue
and
palate
and
a
purely
convulsive
physical
impulse
but
the
echo
laugh
was
a
phantasy
of
mist
and
dawn
and
inestimable
spaces
where
little
green
ferns
and
little
brown
beasties
and
birdlings
frolicked
eternally
in
pristine
sweetness
seven
miles
further
down
the
lake
at
the
beginning
of
the
rapids
the
indian
guide
spoke
again
racking
the
canoe
between
two
rocks
paddling
panting
pushing
sweating
the
indian
guide
lifted
his
voice
high
piercing
above
the
swirling
roar
of
waters
eh
boss
shouted
the
indian
guide
i
ai
never
heard
you
laugh
before
neither
man
spoke
again
more
than
once
or
twice
during
the
long
strenuous
hours
that
were
left
to
them
the
indian
guide
was
very
busy
in
his
stolid
mind
trying
to
figure
out
just
how
many
rows
of
potatoes
could
be
planted
fruitfully
between
his
front
door
and
his
i
do
know
what
the
senior
surgeon
was
trying
to
figure
out
it
was
just
four
days
later
from
a
rolling
hack
that
the
senior
surgeon
disembarked
at
his
own
front
gate
even
though
a
man
likes
home
no
better
than
he
likes
tea
few
men
would
deny
the
soothing
effect
of
home
at
the
end
of
a
long
fussy
railroad
journey
five
also
of
a
late
june
afternoon
is
a
peculiarly
wonderful
time
to
be
arriving
home
especially
if
that
home
has
a
garden
around
it
so
that
you
are
thereby
not
rushed
precipitously
upon
the
house
itself
as
upon
a
cup
without
a
saucer
but
can
toy
visually
with
the
whole
effect
before
you
quench
your
thirst
with
the
actual
draught
very
very
deliberately
with
his
clumsy
in
one
hand
and
his
heavy
grip
in
the
other
the
senior
surgeon
started
up
the
long
broad
gravel
path
to
the
house
for
a
man
walking
as
slow
as
he
was
his
heart
was
beating
most
extraordinarily
fast
he
was
not
accustomed
to
the
symptom
worried
him
a
trifle
incidentally
also
his
lungs
felt
strangely
stifled
with
the
scent
of
june
close
at
his
right
an
effulgent
white
and
gold
syringa
bush
flaunted
its
cloying
sweetness
into
his
senses
close
at
his
left
a
riotous
bloom
of
phlox
clamored
into
his
dazzled
vision
pansies
tiptoed
across
the
grass
in
soft
murky
mystery
a
smoke
tree
loomed
up
here
and
there
like
a
faintly
rouged
ghost
over
everything
under
everything
through
everything
lurked
a
certain
strange
novel
vibrating
consciousness
of
bees
in
the
rose
bushes
bobolinks
in
the
trees
a
in
the
curve
of
the
hammock
a
doll
tea
set
sprawling
cheerfully
in
the
middle
of
the
broad
gravel
path
it
was
not
until
the
senior
surgeon
had
actually
stepped
into
the
tiny
cream
pitcher
that
he
noticed
the
presence
of
the
doll
tea
set
it
was
what
the
senior
surgeon
said
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
cream
pitcher
that
summoned
the
amazing
apparition
from
a
ragged
green
hole
in
the
privet
hedge
startlingly
white
startlingly
professional
dress
cap
apron
and
all
a
miniature
white
linen
nurse
sprang
suddenly
out
at
him
like
a
tricky
dwarf
in
a
moving
picture
show
just
at
that
particular
moment
the
senior
surgeon
nerves
were
in
no
condition
to
wrestle
with
apparitions
simultaneously
as
the
clumsy
dropped
from
his
hand
the
expression
of
enthusiasm
dropped
from
the
face
of
the
miniature
white
linen
nurse
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
have
come
home
wailed
the
familiar
shrill
little
voice
sheepishly
the
senior
surgeon
picked
up
his
the
noises
in
his
head
were
crashing
like
cracked
bells
desperately
with
a
boisterous
irritability
he
sought
to
cover
also
the
lurching
of
his
heart
what
in
hell
are
you
rigged
out
like
that
for
he
demanded
stormily
with
equal
storminess
the
little
girl
protested
the
question
peach
said
i
could
she
attested
passionately
peach
said
i
could
she
did
she
did
i
tell
you
i
did
want
her
to
marry
us
that
day
i
was
afraid
i
was
i
cried
i
did
i
had
a
convulsion
they
thought
it
was
stockings
so
peach
said
if
it
would
make
me
feel
any
gooderer
i
could
be
the
cruel
new
and
she
be
the
unloved
offspring
with
her
hair
braided
all
yellow
fluffikins
down
her
back
where
miss
malgregor
asked
the
senior
surgeon
sharply
irrelevantly
the
little
girl
sank
down
on
the
gravel
walk
and
began
to
gather
up
her
scattered
dishes
and
it
fun
to
go
to
bed
now
she
confided
amiably
every
night
i
put
peach
to
bed
at
eight
and
she
so
naughty
always
i
have
to
stay
with
her
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
morning
like
going
through
a
black
room
without
knowing
it
i
said
where
miss
malgregor
repeated
the
senior
surgeon
with
increasing
sharpness
thriftily
the
little
girl
bent
down
to
lap
a
bubble
of
cream
from
the
broken
pitcher
oh
she
out
in
the
summer
house
with
the
wall
paper
man
she
mumbled
indifferently
chapter
ix
altogether
jerkily
the
senior
surgeon
started
up
the
walk
for
his
own
perfectly
formal
and
respectable
brown
stone
mansion
deep
down
in
his
lurching
heart
he
felt
a
sudden
most
inordinate
desire
to
reach
that
brown
stone
mansion
just
as
quickly
as
possible
but
abruptly
even
to
himself
he
swerved
off
instead
at
the
yellow
sassafras
tree
and
plunged
quite
wildly
through
a
mass
of
broken
sods
towards
the
rickety
cedar
summer
house
startled
by
the
crackle
and
thud
of
his
approach
the
two
young
figures
in
the
summer
house
jumped
precipitously
to
their
feet
and
limply
untwining
their
arms
from
each
other
necks
stood
surveying
the
senior
surgeon
in
unspeakable
consternation
the
white
linen
nurse
and
a
blue
overalled
lad
most
unconscionably
mated
in
radiant
youth
and
agonized
confusion
oh
my
lord
sir
gasped
the
white
linen
nurse
oh
my
lord
sir
i
was
looking
for
for
another
week
evidently
not
said
the
senior
surgeon
incisively
this
is
the
second
time
this
evening
that
i
been
led
to
infer
that
my
was
distinctly
inopportune
very
slowly
very
methodically
he
put
down
first
his
precious
and
then
his
grip
his
brain
seemed
fairly
foaming
with
blood
and
confusion
along
the
swelling
veins
of
his
arms
a
dozen
primitive
instincts
went
surging
to
his
fists
then
quite
brazenly
before
his
eyes
the
white
linen
nurse
reached
out
and
took
the
lad
hand
again
oh
forgive
me
dr
faber
she
faltered
this
is
my
brother
your
what
eh
choked
the
senior
surgeon
bluntly
he
reached
out
and
crushed
the
young
fellow
fingers
in
his
own
glad
to
see
you
son
he
muttered
with
a
sickish
sort
of
grin
and
turning
abruptly
picked
up
his
baggage
again
and
started
for
the
big
house
half
a
step
behind
him
his
white
linen
bride
followed
softly
at
the
edge
of
the
piazza
he
turned
for
an
instant
and
eyed
her
a
bit
quizzically
with
her
big
credulous
blue
eyes
and
her
great
mop
of
yellow
hair
braided
childishly
down
her
back
she
looked
inestimably
more
juvenile
and
innocent
than
his
own
little
whom
he
had
just
left
domestically
ensconced
in
the
middle
of
the
broad
gravel
path
for
heaven
sake
miss
malgregor
he
asked
for
heaven
sake
why
did
you
tell
me
that
the
wall
paper
man
was
your
brother
very
contritely
the
white
linen
nurse
chin
went
burrowing
down
into
the
soft
collar
of
her
dress
and
as
bashfully
as
a
child
one
finger
came
stealing
up
to
the
edge
of
her
red
red
lips
i
was
afraid
you
think
i
was
cheeky
having
any
of
my
family
come
and
live
with
us
so
soon
she
murmured
almost
inaudibly
well
what
did
you
think
i
think
you
were
if
he
was
your
brother
asked
the
senior
surgeon
sardonically
very
economical
i
hoped
beamed
the
white
linen
nurse
all
the
same
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
with
an
irrelevance
surprising
even
to
himself
all
the
same
do
you
think
it
sounds
quite
right
and
proper
for
a
child
to
call
her
again
the
white
linen
nurse
chin
went
burrowing
down
into
the
soft
collar
of
her
dress
i
do
suppose
it
is
usual
she
admitted
reluctantly
the
children
next
door
i
notice
call
theirs
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
the
senior
surgeon
proceeded
up
the
steps
yanked
open
the
shuttered
door
and
burst
quite
breathlessly
and
unprepared
upon
his
most
amazingly
reconstructed
house
all
in
one
single
second
chintzes
muslins
pale
blonde
maples
riotous
canary
birds
stormed
revolutionary
upon
his
outraged
eyes
reeling
back
utterly
aghast
before
the
sight
he
stood
there
staring
dumbly
for
an
instant
at
what
he
considered
and
rightly
too
the
absolute
wreck
of
his
black
walnut
home
it
looks
like
hell
he
muttered
feebly
yes
it
sweet
conceded
the
white
linen
nurse
with
unmistakable
joyousness
and
your
library
triumphantly
she
threw
back
the
door
to
his
grim
good
god
stammered
the
senior
surgeon
you
made
it
pink
rapturously
the
white
linen
nurse
began
to
clasp
and
unclasp
her
hands
i
knew
you
love
it
she
said
half
dazed
with
bewilderment
the
senior
surgeon
started
to
brush
an
imaginary
haze
from
his
eyes
but
paused
in
the
gesture
and
pointed
back
instead
to
a
dapper
little
that
seemed
to
be
exhausting
its
entire
blonde
strength
in
holding
up
a
slender
green
vase
with
a
single
pink
rose
in
it
like
a
caged
animal
buffeting
for
escape
against
each
successive
bar
that
incased
it
the
man
frenzied
irritation
hurled
itself
hopefully
against
this
one
more
chance
for
explosive
exit
what
have
you
done
with
the
big
black
escritoire
that
stood
there
he
demanded
accusingly
escritoire
escritoire
worried
the
white
linen
nurse
why
why
afraid
i
must
have
mislaid
it
mislaid
it
thundered
the
senior
surgeon
mislaid
it
it
weighed
three
hundred
pounds
oh
it
did
questioned
the
white
linen
nurse
with
great
interest
still
mulling
apparently
over
the
fascinating
weight
of
the
escritoire
she
climbed
up
suddenly
into
a
chair
and
with
the
fluffy
end
of
her
extraordinarily
long
braid
of
hair
went
angling
wildy
off
into
space
after
an
illusive
cobweb
faster
and
faster
the
senior
surgeon
temper
began
to
search
for
a
new
point
of
exit
what
do
you
suppose
the
servants
think
of
you
he
stormed
running
round
like
that
with
your
hair
in
a
like
a
kid
servants
cooed
the
white
linen
nurse
servants
very
quietly
she
jumped
down
from
the
chair
and
came
and
stood
looking
up
into
the
senior
surgeon
hectic
face
why
there
are
any
servants
she
explained
patiently
i
dismissed
every
one
of
them
we
doing
our
own
work
now
doing
own
work
gasped
the
senior
surgeon
quite
worriedly
the
white
linen
nurse
stepped
back
a
little
why
was
that
right
she
pleaded
was
it
right
why
i
thought
people
always
did
their
own
work
when
they
were
first
married
with
sudden
apprehensiveness
she
glanced
round
over
her
shoulder
at
the
hall
clock
and
darting
out
through
a
side
door
returned
almost
instantly
with
a
knife
i
so
late
now
and
everything
she
confided
could
you
peel
the
potatoes
for
me
no
i
could
said
the
senior
surgeon
shortly
equally
shortly
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
reaching
out
once
more
for
his
and
grip
went
on
up
the
stairs
to
his
own
room
one
of
the
pleasantest
things
about
arriving
home
very
late
in
the
afternoon
is
the
excuse
it
gives
you
for
loafing
in
your
own
room
while
other
people
are
getting
supper
no
existent
domestic
sound
in
the
whole
hours
is
as
soothing
at
the
end
of
a
long
journey
as
the
sound
of
other
people
getting
supper
stretched
out
full
length
in
a
big
easy
chair
by
his
window
with
his
favorite
pipe
bubbling
rhythmically
between
his
gleaming
white
teeth
the
senior
surgeon
studied
his
new
solid
gold
bed
and
his
new
sage
green
and
his
new
rug
to
the
faint
accompaniment
of
soft
thudding
feet
and
a
laugh
and
a
child
prattle
and
the
of
glass
china
silver
all
scurrying
consciously
to
the
service
of
one
man
and
that
man
very
very
slowly
in
that
special
half
hour
an
inscrutable
little
smile
printed
itself
experimentally
across
the
right
hand
corner
of
the
senior
surgeon
upper
lip
while
that
smile
was
still
in
its
infancy
he
jumped
up
suddenly
and
forced
his
way
across
the
hall
to
his
dead
wife
room
the
one
of
his
house
and
his
life
and
there
with
his
hand
on
the
turning
door
knob
tense
with
reluctance
with
strain
his
breath
gasped
out
of
him
whether
or
no
with
the
one
word
alice
and
behold
there
was
no
room
there
lurching
back
from
the
threshold
as
from
the
brink
of
an
elevator
well
the
senior
surgeon
found
himself
staring
foolishly
into
a
most
sumptuous
linen
closet
tiered
like
an
aztec
cliff
with
home
after
home
for
pleasant
prosy
blankets
and
gaily
fringed
towels
and
cheerful
white
sheets
reeking
most
conscientiously
of
cedar
and
lavender
tiptoeing
cautiously
into
the
mystery
he
sensed
at
one
astonished
grateful
glance
how
the
change
of
a
partition
the
of
a
proportion
had
purged
like
a
draft
of
fresh
air
the
stale
gloom
of
an
memory
yet
so
inevitable
did
it
suddenly
seem
for
a
linen
closet
to
be
built
right
there
so
inevitable
did
it
suddenly
seem
for
the
meager
to
be
enlarged
just
there
that
to
save
his
soul
he
could
not
estimate
whether
the
happy
plan
had
originated
in
a
purely
practical
brain
or
a
purely
compassionate
heart
half
proud
of
the
brain
half
touched
by
the
heart
he
passed
on
exploringly
through
the
new
out
into
the
hall
again
quite
distinctly
now
through
the
aperture
of
the
back
stairs
the
kitchen
voices
came
wafting
up
to
him
oh
dear
oh
dear
wailed
his
little
girl
peevish
voice
now
that
that
man
come
back
again
i
suppose
we
have
to
eat
in
the
all
the
time
man
happens
to
be
your
darling
father
admonished
the
white
linen
nurse
laughing
voice
even
so
wailed
the
little
girl
i
love
you
best
even
so
laughed
the
white
linen
nurse
i
love
best
just
the
same
cried
the
little
girl
shrilly
just
the
same
put
the
cream
pitcher
way
up
high
somewhere
so
he
ca
step
in
it
as
though
from
a
head
tilted
suddenly
backward
the
white
linen
laugh
rang
out
in
joyous
abandon
impulsively
the
senior
surgeon
started
to
grin
then
equally
impulsively
the
grin
soured
on
his
lips
so
they
thought
he
was
clumsy
eh
resentfully
he
stared
down
at
his
hands
those
wonderfully
dexterous
yes
ambidexterous
hands
that
were
the
aching
envy
of
all
his
colleagues
interruptingly
as
he
stared
the
voice
of
the
young
wall
paper
man
rose
buoyantly
from
the
lower
hallway
supper
all
ready
sir
called
the
cordial
voice
for
some
inexplainable
reason
at
that
particular
moment
almost
nothing
in
the
world
could
have
irritated
the
senior
surgeon
more
keenly
than
to
be
invited
to
his
own
supper
in
his
own
house
by
a
stranger
fuming
with
a
new
sense
of
injury
and
injustice
he
started
heavily
down
the
stairs
to
the
standing
patiently
behind
the
senior
surgeon
chair
with
a
laudable
desire
to
assist
his
carving
in
any
possible
emergency
that
might
occur
the
white
linen
nurse
experienced
her
first
direct
marital
rebuff
what
do
you
think
this
is
an
autopsy
demanded
the
senior
surgeon
tartly
for
heaven
sake
sit
down
quite
meekly
the
white
linen
nurse
subsided
into
her
place
the
meal
that
ensued
could
hardly
have
been
called
a
success
though
the
room
was
entrancing
the
cloth
the
silver
radiant
the
guinea
chicken
beyond
reproach
swept
and
garnished
to
an
alarming
degree
the
young
wall
paper
man
presided
over
the
gravy
and
did
his
uttermost
innocent
to
make
the
senior
surgeon
feel
perfectly
at
home
conscientiously
as
in
the
presence
of
a
distinguished
stranger
the
little
crippled
girl
most
palpably
from
time
to
time
repressed
her
insatiable
desire
to
build
a
towering
pyramid
out
of
all
the
salt
and
pepper
shakers
she
could
reach
once
when
the
young
wall
paper
man
forgot
himself
to
the
extent
of
putting
his
knife
in
his
mouth
the
white
linen
nurse
jarred
the
whole
table
with
the
violence
of
her
warning
kick
once
when
the
little
crippled
girl
piped
out
impulsively
say
peach
what
was
the
name
of
that
bantam
your
father
used
to
fight
against
the
minister
bantam
the
white
linen
nurse
choked
piteously
over
her
food
twice
some
one
spoke
about
this
year
weather
twice
some
one
volunteered
an
illuminating
remark
about
last
weather
except
for
these
four
diversions
restraint
indescribable
hung
like
a
horrid
pall
over
the
feast
next
to
feeling
unwelcome
in
your
friend
house
nothing
certainly
is
more
wretchedly
disconcerting
than
to
feel
unwelcome
in
your
own
house
grimly
the
senior
surgeon
longed
to
grab
up
all
the
knives
within
reach
and
ram
them
successively
into
his
own
mouth
just
to
prove
to
the
young
wall
paper
man
what
a
what
a
devil
of
a
good
fellow
he
was
himself
grimly
the
senior
surgeon
longed
to
tell
the
white
linen
nurse
about
the
pet
bantam
of
his
own
boyhood
days
that
he
bet
a
dollar
could
lick
any
bantam
her
father
ever
dreamed
of
owning
grimly
the
senior
surgeon
longed
to
talk
dolls
dishes
kittens
yes
even
cream
pitchers
to
his
little
daughter
to
talk
anything
in
fact
to
to
talk
sing
shout
that
should
make
him
at
least
for
the
time
being
one
at
heart
one
at
head
one
at
table
with
this
astonishingly
offish
bunch
of
youngsters
but
grimly
instead
out
of
his
frazzled
nerves
out
of
his
innate
spiritual
bashfulness
he
merely
roared
forth
where
are
the
potatoes
potatoes
gasped
the
white
linen
nurse
potatoes
oh
potatoes
she
finished
more
blithely
why
yes
of
course
do
you
remember
you
did
have
time
to
peel
them
for
me
i
was
so
disappointed
you
were
so
disappointed
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
you
you
janglingly
the
little
crippled
girl
knelt
right
up
in
her
chair
and
shook
her
tiny
fist
right
in
her
father
face
now
lendicott
paber
she
screamed
do
you
start
in
sassing
my
darling
little
peach
snorted
the
senior
surgeon
with
almost
supernatural
calm
he
put
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
eyed
his
offspring
with
an
expression
of
absolutely
inflexible
purpose
do
you
ever
he
warned
her
ever
ever
let
me
hear
you
call
this
woman
again
a
trifle
the
little
crippled
girl
reached
up
and
straightened
her
absurdly
diminutive
little
white
cap
and
pursed
her
little
mouth
as
nearly
as
possible
into
an
expression
of
ineffable
peace
why
lendicott
faber
she
persisted
heroically
jumped
the
senior
surgeon
what
are
for
hilariously
with
her
own
knife
and
fork
the
little
crippled
girl
began
to
beat
upon
the
table
why
you
dear
silly
she
cried
why
if
i
the
new
marma
i
got
to
call
you
and
peach
has
got
to
call
you
father
frenziedly
the
senior
surgeon
pushed
back
his
chair
and
jumped
to
his
feet
the
expression
on
his
face
was
neither
smile
nor
frown
nor
war
nor
peace
nor
any
other
human
expression
that
had
ever
puckered
there
before
god
he
said
this
gives
me
the
and
strode
tempestuously
from
the
room
out
in
his
own
fortunately
whatever
the
grotesque
new
pinkness
whatever
the
grotesque
new
perkiness
his
great
free
had
not
been
interfered
with
slamming
his
door
triumphantly
behind
him
he
resumed
once
more
the
monotonous
that
had
characterized
for
eighteen
years
his
first
night
return
to
the
obligations
of
civilization
sharply
around
the
corner
of
his
old
battered
desk
the
little
path
started
wanly
along
the
edge
of
his
dingy
the
little
path
furrowed
wistfully
at
the
deep
where
his
favorite
lilac
bush
budded
whitely
for
his
departure
and
rusted
brownly
for
his
return
the
little
path
faltered
and
went
on
again
on
and
on
and
on
into
the
alcove
where
his
instruments
glistened
up
to
the
fireplace
where
his
college
tarnished
listlessly
the
senior
surgeon
his
yearly
vigil
up
and
down
up
and
down
round
and
round
on
and
on
and
on
through
interminable
dusks
to
unattainable
dawns
a
glutted
bacchanalian
soul
sweating
its
own
way
back
to
sanctity
and
leanness
nerves
always
were
in
that
vigil
raw
rattling
nerves
clamoring
vociferously
to
be
repacked
in
their
sedatives
thirst
also
was
in
that
vigil
no
mere
whimpering
tickle
of
the
palate
but
a
drought
of
the
tissues
a
consuming
fire
of
the
bones
hurt
pride
was
also
there
and
festering
humiliation
but
more
rasping
this
particular
night
than
nerves
more
poignant
than
thirst
more
dangerously
excitative
even
than
remorse
hunger
rioted
in
him
hunger
the
one
worst
enemy
of
the
senior
surgeon
cause
the
simple
silly
gnawing
hunger
of
an
empty
stomach
and
other
hunger
was
also
there
a
sudden
fierce
new
lust
for
life
and
living
a
passion
bare
of
love
yet
pure
of
wantonness
a
passion
primitive
protective
inexorably
proprietary
engendered
strangely
in
that
one
mad
suspicious
moment
at
the
edge
of
the
summer
house
when
every
outraged
male
instinct
in
him
had
leaped
to
prove
that
love
or
no
love
the
woman
was
up
and
down
up
and
down
round
and
round
eight
found
the
senior
surgeon
still
pacing
at
half
past
eight
the
young
wall
paper
man
came
to
say
to
him
as
long
as
sister
wo
be
alone
any
more
i
guess
i
be
moving
on
beamed
the
wall
paper
man
there
a
dance
at
home
saturday
night
and
i
got
a
girl
of
my
own
he
confided
genially
come
again
urged
the
senior
surgeon
come
again
when
you
can
stay
longer
with
one
honest
prayer
in
stock
and
at
least
two
purely
automatic
social
speeches
of
this
sort
no
man
needs
to
flounder
altogether
hopelessly
for
words
in
any
ordinary
emergency
of
life
thus
with
no
more
mental
interruption
than
the
break
in
time
the
senior
surgeon
then
resumed
his
pacing
at
nine
however
patroling
his
long
rangy
he
sensed
with
a
very
different
feeling
through
his
heavy
oak
door
the
soft
whirring
swish
of
skirts
and
the
breathy
twitter
of
muffled
voices
faintly
to
his
acute
ears
came
the
sound
of
his
little
temperish
protest
i
wo
i
wo
and
the
white
linen
fervid
pleading
oh
you
must
you
must
and
the
little
mumbled
ultimatum
well
i
wo
unless
do
irascibly
he
crossed
the
room
and
yanked
the
door
open
abruptly
upon
their
surprise
and
confusion
his
nerves
were
very
sore
what
in
thunder
do
you
want
he
snarled
nervously
for
an
instant
the
white
linen
nurse
tugged
at
the
little
girl
hand
nervously
for
an
instant
the
little
girl
tugged
at
the
white
linen
nurse
hand
then
with
a
swallow
like
a
sob
the
white
linen
nurse
lifted
her
glowing
face
to
his
k
kiss
us
good
night
said
the
white
linen
nurse
telescopically
all
in
that
startling
second
vision
after
vision
beat
down
like
blows
upon
the
senior
surgeon
senses
the
pink
pink
flush
of
the
girl
the
lure
of
her
the
amazing
sweetness
the
physical
docility
oh
ye
gods
the
docility
every
trend
of
her
birth
of
her
youth
of
her
training
forcing
her
now
if
he
chose
it
to
unquestioning
submission
to
his
will
and
his
judgment
faster
and
faster
the
temptation
surged
through
his
pulses
the
path
from
her
lips
to
her
ear
was
such
a
little
path
the
plea
so
quick
to
make
so
short
i
want
you
k
kiss
us
good
night
urged
the
big
girl
unsuspecting
lips
kiss
us
good
night
mocked
the
little
girl
tremulous
echo
then
explosively
with
the
noblest
rudeness
of
his
life
no
i
said
the
senior
surgeon
and
slammed
the
door
in
their
faces
falteringly
up
the
stairs
he
heard
the
two
ascending
speechless
with
surprise
perhaps
stunned
by
his
roughness
still
hand
in
hand
probably
still
climbing
slowly
the
soft
smooth
patient
footfall
of
the
white
linen
nurse
and
the
jerky
laborious
of
a
little
dragging
leg
up
and
down
round
and
round
on
and
on
and
on
the
senior
surgeon
resumed
his
pacing
under
his
eyes
great
shadows
darkened
along
the
corners
of
his
mouth
the
lines
furrowed
like
gray
scars
up
and
down
round
and
round
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
at
ten
sitting
bolt
upright
in
her
bed
with
her
worried
eyes
straining
bluely
out
across
the
little
girl
somnolent
form
into
unfathomable
darkness
the
white
linen
nurse
in
the
throb
of
her
own
heart
began
to
keep
pace
with
that
faint
horrid
in
the
room
below
was
he
passing
the
now
had
he
reached
the
was
he
dawdling
over
those
glistening
scalpels
would
his
nerves
remember
the
flask
in
that
upper
desk
drawer
up
and
down
round
and
round
on
and
on
the
harrowing
sound
continued
resolutely
at
last
she
scrambled
out
of
her
snug
nest
and
hurrying
into
her
great
warm
wrapper
began
at
once
very
practically
very
unemotionally
with
matches
and
alcohol
and
a
shiny
glass
jar
to
prepare
a
huge
steaming
cup
of
malted
milk
was
infinitely
better
she
knew
or
eggs
of
course
but
if
she
should
venture
forth
to
the
kitchen
for
real
substantiate
the
senior
surgeon
she
felt
quite
positive
would
almost
certainly
hear
her
and
stop
her
so
very
stealthily
thus
like
the
proverbial
assassin
she
crept
down
the
front
stairs
with
the
innocent
malted
milk
cup
in
her
hand
and
then
with
her
knuckles
just
on
the
verge
of
rapping
against
the
grimly
inhospitable
door
went
suddenly
paralyzed
with
uncertainty
whether
to
advance
or
retreat
once
again
through
the
sombre
inert
wainscoting
exactly
as
if
a
soul
had
creaked
the
senior
surgeon
sensed
the
threatening
intrusive
presence
of
an
unseen
personality
once
again
he
strode
across
the
room
and
jerked
the
door
open
with
terrifying
anger
and
resentment
as
though
frozen
there
on
his
threshold
by
her
own
little
bare
feet
as
though
strangled
there
in
his
doorway
by
her
own
great
mop
of
golden
hair
stolid
and
dumb
as
a
graven
image
the
white
linen
nurse
thrust
the
cup
out
awkwardly
at
him
absolutely
without
comment
as
though
she
trotted
on
purely
professional
business
and
the
case
involved
was
of
mutual
concern
to
them
both
the
senior
surgeon
took
the
cup
from
her
hand
and
closed
the
door
again
in
her
face
at
eleven
she
came
again
just
as
pink
just
as
blue
just
as
gray
just
as
golden
and
the
cup
of
malted
milk
she
brought
with
her
was
just
as
huge
just
as
hot
just
as
steaming
only
this
time
she
had
smuggled
two
raw
eggs
into
it
once
more
the
senior
surgeon
took
the
cup
without
comment
and
shut
the
door
in
her
face
at
twelve
she
came
again
the
senior
surgeon
was
unusually
loquacious
this
time
have
you
any
more
malted
milk
he
asked
tersely
oh
yes
sir
beamed
the
white
linen
nurse
go
and
get
it
said
the
senior
surgeon
obediently
the
white
linen
nurse
pattered
up
the
stairs
and
returned
with
the
half
depleted
bottle
frankly
interested
she
recrossed
the
threshold
of
the
room
and
delivered
her
glass
treasure
into
the
hands
of
the
senior
surgeon
as
he
stood
by
his
desk
raising
herself
to
her
tiptoes
she
noted
with
eminent
satisfaction
that
the
three
big
cups
on
the
other
side
of
the
desk
had
all
been
drained
to
their
dregs
then
very
bluntly
before
her
eyes
the
senior
surgeon
took
the
malted
milk
bottle
and
poured
its
remaining
contents
out
quite
wantonly
into
his
waste
basket
then
equally
bluntly
he
took
the
white
linen
nurse
by
the
shoulders
and
marched
her
out
of
the
room
for
god
sake
he
said
get
out
of
this
room
and
stay
out
the
big
door
slammed
behind
her
like
a
snarling
fang
the
lock
bit
into
its
catch
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
even
just
to
herself
all
alone
there
in
the
big
black
hall
she
was
perfectly
polite
sir
she
repeated
softly
with
a
slightly
sardonic
grin
on
his
face
the
senior
surgeon
resumed
his
pacing
up
and
down
round
and
round
on
and
on
and
on
at
one
in
the
dull
clammy
chill
of
earliest
morning
he
stopped
long
enough
to
light
his
hearthfire
at
two
he
stopped
again
to
pile
on
a
trifle
more
wood
at
three
he
dallied
for
an
instant
to
close
a
window
the
new
day
seemed
strangely
cold
at
four
dawn
the
wonder
the
miracle
the
long
despaired
of
quickened
wanly
across
the
east
then
suddenly
more
like
a
phosphorescent
breeze
than
a
glow
the
pale
pale
yellow
sunshine
came
wafting
through
the
green
gloom
of
the
garden
the
vigil
was
over
stumbling
out
into
the
shadowy
hall
to
greet
the
new
day
and
the
new
beginning
the
senior
surgeon
almost
tripped
and
fell
over
the
white
linen
nurse
sitting
all
huddled
up
and
in
a
little
gray
heap
on
his
outer
threshold
the
sensation
of
stepping
upon
a
human
body
is
not
a
pleasant
one
it
smote
the
senior
surgeon
nauseously
through
the
nerves
of
his
stomach
what
are
you
doing
here
he
fairly
screamed
at
her
just
keeping
you
company
sir
yawned
the
white
linen
nurse
before
her
hand
could
reach
her
mouth
again
another
great
childish
yawn
overwhelmed
her
just
watching
with
you
sir
she
finished
more
or
less
inarticulately
watching
with
me
snarled
the
senior
surgeon
resentfully
why
should
you
watch
with
me
like
the
frightened
flash
of
a
bird
the
heavy
lashes
went
swooping
down
across
the
pink
cheeks
and
lifted
as
suddenly
again
because
my
yawned
the
white
linen
nurse
almost
roughly
the
senior
surgeon
reached
down
and
pulled
the
white
linen
nurse
to
her
feet
god
said
the
senior
surgeon
in
his
strained
husky
voice
the
word
sounded
like
an
oath
grotesquely
a
little
smile
went
scudding
across
his
haggard
face
with
an
impulse
absolutely
alien
to
him
he
reached
out
abruptly
again
and
raised
the
white
linen
nurse
hand
to
his
lips
god
was
what
i
meant
miss
malgregor
he
grinned
a
bit
sheepishly
quite
bruskly
then
he
turned
and
looked
at
his
watch
i
like
my
breakfast
just
as
soon
now
as
you
can
possibly
get
it
he
ordered
peremptorily
in
his
own
morbid
pathological
emergency
no
more
stopping
to
consider
the
white
linen
nurse
purely
normal
fatigue
than
he
in
any
pathological
emergency
of
hers
would
have
stopped
to
consider
his
own
comfort
safety
or
even
perhaps
life
joyously
then
like
a
prisoner
just
turned
loose
he
went
swinging
up
the
stairs
to
recreate
himself
with
a
smoke
and
a
shave
and
a
great
splashing
cold
only
one
thing
seemed
to
really
trouble
him
now
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
stopped
for
an
instant
and
cocked
his
head
a
bit
worriedly
towards
the
where
from
some
alcove
after
went
fluting
shrilly
up
into
the
morning
is
that
those
blasted
canaries
he
asked
briefly
very
companionably
the
white
linen
nurse
cocked
her
own
towsled
head
on
one
side
and
listened
with
him
for
half
a
moment
only
four
of
them
are
blasted
canaries
she
corrected
very
gently
the
fifth
one
is
a
paroquet
that
i
got
at
a
because
it
was
a
widowed
bird
and
would
mate
again
eh
jerked
the
senior
surgeon
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
and
started
for
the
kitchen
no
one
but
the
senior
surgeon
himself
breakfasted
in
state
at
five
that
morning
snug
and
safe
in
her
crib
upstairs
the
little
crippled
girl
slumbered
peacefully
on
through
the
general
disturbance
and
as
for
the
white
linen
nurse
herself
what
with
chilling
and
rechilling
melons
and
broiling
and
unbroiling
steaks
and
making
and
remaking
coffee
and
hunting
frantically
for
a
water
glass
or
a
prettier
colored
plate
there
was
no
time
for
anything
except
an
occasional
hurried
surreptitious
nibble
half
way
between
the
stove
and
the
table
yet
in
all
that
raucous
early
morning
hour
together
neither
man
nor
girl
suffered
towards
the
other
the
slightest
personal
sense
of
contrition
or
resentment
for
each
mind
was
trained
equally
fairly
whether
reacting
on
its
own
case
or
another
to
differentiate
pretty
readily
between
mean
nerves
and
a
mean
spirit
only
once
in
fact
across
the
intervening
chasm
of
crankiness
did
the
senior
surgeon
hurl
a
smile
that
was
even
remotely
or
conciliatory
glancing
up
suddenly
from
a
particularly
sharp
and
disagreeable
speech
he
noted
the
white
linen
nurse
red
lips
mumbling
softly
one
to
the
other
are
you
specially
religious
miss
malgregor
he
grinned
quite
abruptly
no
not
specially
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
why
sir
oh
it
only
grinned
the
senior
surgeon
dourly
it
only
that
every
time
i
especially
ugly
to
you
i
see
your
lips
moving
as
though
in
prayer
as
they
call
it
and
i
was
just
wondering
if
there
was
any
special
formula
you
used
with
me
that
kept
you
so
everlastingly
damned
serene
is
there
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
what
is
it
demanded
the
senior
surgeon
quite
bluntly
do
i
have
to
tell
gasped
the
white
linen
nurse
a
little
tremulously
in
her
hand
the
empty
cup
she
was
carrying
rattled
against
its
saucer
do
i
have
to
tell
she
repeated
pleadingly
a
delirious
little
thrill
of
power
went
fluttering
through
the
senior
surgeon
heart
yes
you
have
to
tell
me
he
announced
quite
seriously
in
absolute
submission
to
his
demand
though
with
very
palpable
reluctance
the
white
linen
nurse
came
forward
to
the
table
put
down
the
cup
and
saucer
and
began
to
finger
a
trifle
nervously
at
the
cloth
oh
i
sure
i
did
mean
any
harm
sir
she
stammered
but
all
i
say
is
honest
and
truly
all
i
say
is
he
nothing
but
a
man
nothing
but
a
man
nothing
but
a
man
over
and
over
and
over
just
that
sir
uproariously
the
senior
surgeon
pushed
back
his
chair
and
jumped
to
his
feet
i
guess
after
all
i
have
to
let
the
little
kid
call
you
one
day
a
week
he
acknowledged
jocosely
with
infinite
seriousness
then
he
tossed
back
his
great
splendid
head
shook
himself
free
apparently
from
all
unhappy
memories
and
started
for
his
a
great
gorgeously
vital
extraordinarily
talented
lusting
joyously
for
his
own
work
and
play
again
after
a
month
distressing
illness
from
the
edge
of
the
hall
he
turned
round
and
made
a
really
boyish
grimace
at
her
now
if
i
only
had
the
horns
or
the
cloven
hoof
that
you
think
i
have
he
called
what
an
easy
time
i
make
of
it
raking
over
all
the
letters
and
ads
that
are
stacked
up
on
my
desk
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
only
once
did
he
come
back
into
the
kitchen
or
for
anything
it
was
at
seven
and
the
white
linen
nurse
was
still
washing
dishes
as
radiant
as
a
god
he
towered
up
in
the
doorway
the
boyish
rejuvenation
in
him
was
even
more
startling
than
before
i
feeling
so
much
like
a
fighting
cock
this
morning
he
said
i
think
i
tackle
that
paper
on
surgical
diseases
of
the
pancreas
that
i
have
to
read
at
baltimore
next
month
a
little
startlingly
the
gray
lines
furrowed
into
his
cheeks
again
for
heaven
sake
see
that
not
disturbed
by
anything
he
admonished
her
warningly
it
must
have
been
almost
eight
when
the
scream
from
upstairs
sent
the
white
linen
nurse
plunging
out
into
the
hall
oh
peach
peach
yelled
the
little
girl
frenzied
voice
come
quick
and
see
what
fat
father
doing
out
on
the
piazza
jerkily
the
white
linen
nurse
swerved
off
through
the
french
door
that
opened
directly
on
the
piazza
had
the
senior
surgeon
hung
himself
she
tortured
in
some
wild
temporary
aberration
of
the
morning
after
but
staunchly
and
reassuringly
from
the
further
end
of
the
the
senior
surgeon
broad
back
belied
her
horrid
terror
quite
prosily
and
in
apparently
perfect
health
he
was
standing
close
to
the
railing
of
the
piazza
on
a
table
directly
beside
him
rested
four
empty
bird
cages
just
at
that
particular
moment
he
was
inordinately
busy
releasing
the
last
canary
from
the
fifth
cage
both
hands
were
smouched
with
ink
and
behind
his
left
ear
a
fountain
pen
dallied
daringly
at
the
very
first
sound
of
the
white
linen
nurse
step
the
senior
surgeon
turned
and
faced
her
with
a
sheepish
sort
of
defiance
well
now
i
imagine
he
said
well
now
i
imagine
i
really
made
you
mad
no
not
mad
sir
faltered
the
white
linen
nurse
no
not
mad
sir
but
very
far
from
well
coaxingly
with
a
perfectly
futile
hand
she
tried
to
lure
one
astonished
yellow
songster
back
from
a
swaying
yellow
bush
why
they
die
sir
she
protested
savage
cats
will
get
them
it
a
choice
of
their
lives
or
mine
said
the
senior
surgeon
tersely
yes
sir
droned
the
white
linen
nurse
quite
snappishly
the
senior
surgeon
turned
upon
her
for
sake
do
you
think
canary
birds
are
more
valuable
than
i
am
he
demanded
stentoriously
most
disconcertingly
before
his
glowering
eyes
a
great
sad
round
tear
rolled
suddenly
down
the
white
linen
nurse
flushed
cheek
n
o
not
more
valuable
conceded
the
white
linen
nurse
but
more
up
to
the
roots
of
the
senior
surgeon
hair
a
flush
of
real
contrition
spread
hotly
why
rae
he
stammered
why
what
a
beast
i
am
why
why
in
sincere
perplexity
he
began
to
rack
his
brains
for
some
adequate
excuse
some
adequate
explanation
why
i
sure
i
did
mean
to
make
you
feel
badly
he
persisted
only
i
lived
alone
so
long
that
i
suppose
i
just
naturally
drifted
into
the
way
of
having
a
thing
if
i
wanted
it
and
throwing
it
away
if
i
did
and
canary
birds
now
well
really
he
began
to
glower
all
over
again
oh
thunder
he
finished
abruptly
i
guess
i
go
on
down
to
the
hospital
where
i
belong
a
little
wistfully
the
white
linen
nurse
stepped
forward
the
hospital
she
said
oh
the
hospital
do
you
think
that
perhaps
you
could
come
home
a
little
bit
earlier
than
usual
and
and
help
me
catch
just
one
of
the
canaries
what
gasped
the
senior
surgeon
incredulously
with
a
very
inky
finger
he
pointed
at
his
own
breast
what
i
he
demanded
i
come
home
early
from
the
hospital
to
help
you
catch
a
canary
disgustedly
without
further
comment
he
turned
and
stalked
back
again
into
the
house
the
disgust
was
still
in
his
walk
as
he
left
the
house
an
hour
later
watching
his
exit
down
the
long
gravel
path
the
little
crippled
girl
commented
audibly
on
the
matter
peach
peach
called
the
little
crippled
girl
what
makes
fat
father
walk
so
surprised
people
at
the
hospital
also
commented
upon
him
gee
giggled
the
new
nurses
we
bet
he
a
tartar
but
is
his
hair
cute
and
say
gossiped
the
new
nurses
is
it
really
true
that
that
malgregor
girl
was
pinned
down
perfectly
helpless
under
the
car
and
he
would
let
her
out
till
she
promised
to
marry
him
is
it
is
it
why
faber
back
fluttered
the
senior
nurses
is
he
wonderful
is
he
beautiful
but
oh
say
they
worried
what
do
you
suppose
rae
ever
finds
to
talk
with
him
about
would
she
ever
dare
talk
to
him
just
plain
hats
and
going
to
the
theater
and
what
to
have
for
breakfast
breakfast
they
gasped
why
yes
of
course
they
reasoned
more
sanely
steak
eggs
even
oatmeal
why
people
had
to
eat
no
matter
how
wonderful
they
were
but
evenings
they
speculated
more
darkly
but
evenings
in
the
whole
range
of
human
experience
was
it
even
so
much
as
remotely
imaginable
that
evenings
the
senior
surgeon
and
rae
malgregor
sat
in
the
hammock
and
held
hands
oh
gee
blanched
the
senior
nurses
dr
faber
greeted
the
superintendent
of
nurses
from
behind
her
austere
office
desk
miss
hartzen
said
the
senior
surgeon
have
you
had
a
pleasant
trip
quizzed
the
superintendent
of
nurses
exceptionally
so
thank
you
said
the
senior
surgeon
and
faber
is
she
well
persisted
the
superintendent
of
nurses
conscientiously
mrs
faber
gasped
the
senior
surgeon
faber
oh
yes
why
of
course
yes
indeed
she
extraordinarily
well
i
never
saw
her
better
she
must
have
been
very
lonely
without
you
this
past
month
rasped
the
superintendent
of
nurses
perfectly
politely
yes
she
was
flushed
the
senior
surgeon
she
she
suffered
keenly
and
you
too
drawled
the
superintendent
of
nurses
it
must
have
been
very
hard
for
you
yes
it
was
sweated
the
senior
surgeon
i
suffered
keenly
too
distractedly
he
glanced
back
at
the
open
door
an
extraordinarily
large
number
of
nurses
internes
orderlies
seemed
to
be
having
errands
up
and
down
the
corridor
that
allowed
them
a
peculiarly
generous
length
of
neck
to
stretch
into
the
superintendent
office
great
heavens
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
what
the
matter
with
everybody
this
morning
tempestuously
he
started
for
the
door
hurry
up
my
cases
please
miss
hartzen
he
ordered
send
them
to
the
operating
room
and
let
me
get
to
work
at
eleven
absolutely
calm
absolutely
cool
pure
as
a
girl
in
his
fresh
white
operating
clothes
cleaner
skin
hair
teeth
hands
than
any
girl
who
ever
walked
the
face
of
the
earth
in
a
white
tiled
room
as
surgically
clean
as
himself
with
three
or
four
small
glistening
instruments
still
boiling
steaming
hot
and
half
a
dozen
breathless
assistants
almost
as
immaculate
as
himself
with
his
gown
cap
and
mask
adjusted
his
gloves
finally
on
and
the
faintest
possible
little
grin
twitching
oddly
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
he
went
in
as
they
say
to
a
new
born
baby
tortured
twisted
spine
and
took
out
fifty
years
perhaps
of
pain
and
shame
and
morbid
passions
flourishing
banefully
in
the
dark
shades
of
a
disordered
life
at
twelve
he
did
an
appendix
operation
on
the
only
son
of
his
best
friend
at
one
he
did
another
appendix
operation
whom
it
was
on
did
matter
it
could
have
been
worse
on
any
one
at
one
no
one
remembered
to
feed
him
at
two
in
another
operation
he
saw
the
richest
merchant
in
the
city
go
wafted
out
into
eternity
on
the
fumes
of
ether
taken
for
the
lancing
of
a
stye
at
three
passing
the
open
door
of
one
of
the
public
an
italian
peasant
woman
rushed
out
and
spat
in
his
face
because
her
tubercular
daughter
had
just
died
at
the
sanitarium
where
the
senior
surgeon
money
had
sent
her
only
in
this
one
wild
defiling
moment
did
the
lust
for
alcohol
surge
up
in
him
again
surge
clamorously
brutally
absolutely
mercilessly
as
though
in
all
the
known
cleansants
of
the
world
only
interminable
raw
whisky
was
hot
enough
to
cauterize
a
polluted
consciousness
at
half
past
three
as
soon
as
he
could
change
his
clothes
again
he
and
an
acrobat
priceless
leg
at
five
more
to
rest
himself
than
anything
else
he
went
up
to
the
autopsy
amphitheater
to
look
over
an
exhibit
of
enlarged
hearts
whose
troubles
were
permanently
over
at
six
just
as
he
was
leaving
the
great
building
with
all
its
harrowing
sights
sounds
and
smells
a
peremptory
telephone
call
from
one
of
the
younger
surgeons
of
the
city
summoned
him
back
into
the
stuffy
office
again
dr
faber
yes
this
is
merkley
yes
can
you
come
immediately
and
help
me
with
that
fractured
skull
case
i
was
telling
you
about
this
morning
we
have
to
trepan
right
away
trepan
nothing
grunted
the
senior
surgeon
i
got
to
go
home
early
and
help
catch
a
canary
catch
a
what
gasped
the
younger
surgeon
a
canary
grinned
the
senior
surgeon
mirthlessly
a
roared
the
younger
man
oh
shut
up
you
damned
fool
of
course
i
come
said
the
senior
surgeon
there
was
no
boy
left
in
the
senior
surgeon
when
he
reached
home
that
night
gray
with
haggard
with
strain
and
fatigue
it
was
long
long
after
the
rosy
sunset
time
long
long
after
the
yellow
supper
light
that
he
came
dragging
up
through
the
dusk
of
the
garden
and
threw
himself
down
without
greeting
of
any
sort
on
the
top
step
of
the
piazza
where
the
white
linen
nurse
skirts
glowed
palely
through
the
gloom
well
i
put
a
canary
bird
back
into
its
cage
for
you
he
confided
laconically
it
was
a
little
chap
soul
it
sure
would
have
gotten
away
before
morning
who
was
the
man
that
tried
to
turn
it
loose
time
asked
the
white
linen
nurse
i
did
say
that
anybody
did
growled
the
senior
surgeon
oh
said
the
white
linen
nurse
oh
quite
palpably
a
little
shiver
of
flesh
and
starch
went
rustling
through
her
i
had
a
wonderful
day
too
she
confided
softly
i
cleaned
the
attic
and
darned
nine
pairs
of
your
stockings
and
bought
a
and
started
to
make
you
a
white
silk
negligee
shirt
for
a
surprise
eh
jerked
the
senior
surgeon
the
jerk
seemed
to
liberate
suddenly
the
faint
vibration
of
dishes
and
the
sound
of
ice
knocking
lusciously
against
a
glass
oh
have
you
had
any
supper
sir
asked
the
white
linen
nurse
with
a
prodigious
sigh
the
senior
surgeon
threw
his
head
back
against
the
piazza
railing
and
stretched
his
legs
a
little
further
out
along
the
piazza
floor
supper
he
groaned
no
nor
dinner
nor
breakfast
nor
any
other
meal
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
janglingly
in
his
voice
fatigue
hunger
nerves
crashed
together
like
the
slammed
notes
of
a
piano
but
i
would
move
now
he
snarled
if
all
the
foods
in
christendom
were
piled
high
on
all
the
tables
in
this
whole
house
ecstatically
the
white
linen
nurse
clapped
her
hands
oh
that
just
exactly
what
i
hoped
you
say
she
cried
the
supper
right
here
here
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
tempestuously
he
began
all
over
again
i
tell
you
i
would
lift
my
little
finger
if
all
the
oh
goody
then
said
the
white
linen
nurse
now
i
can
feed
you
i
sort
of
miss
fussing
with
the
canary
birds
she
added
wistfully
feed
me
roared
the
senior
surgeon
again
something
started
a
lump
of
ice
tinkling
faintly
in
a
thin
glass
feed
me
he
began
all
over
again
yet
with
a
fragrant
strawberry
half
as
big
as
a
peach
held
out
suddenly
under
his
nose
just
from
sheer
irresistible
instinct
he
bit
out
at
it
and
nipped
the
white
linen
nurse
finger
instead
ouch
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
mumblingly
down
from
an
upstairs
window
as
from
a
face
flatted
smouchingly
against
a
wire
screen
a
peremptory
summons
issued
peach
peach
called
an
angry
little
voice
if
you
do
come
to
bed
now
i
i
say
my
curses
instead
of
my
prayers
a
trifle
nervously
the
white
linen
nurse
scrambled
to
her
feet
maybe
i
better
go
she
said
maybe
you
had
said
the
senior
surgeon
quite
definitely
at
the
edge
of
the
threshold
the
white
linen
nurse
turned
for
an
instant
dr
faber
she
whispered
rae
malgregor
faber
said
the
senior
surgeon
gasped
the
white
linen
nurse
rae
malgregor
faber
repeated
the
senior
surgeon
clutching
at
her
skirts
as
though
a
mouse
were
after
her
the
white
linen
nurse
went
scuttling
up
the
stairs
very
late
on
into
the
night
the
senior
surgeon
lay
there
on
his
piazza
floor
staring
out
into
his
garden
very
companionably
from
time
to
time
like
a
tame
firefly
a
little
bright
spark
hovered
and
glowed
for
an
instant
above
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
into
the
night
chapter
x
so
the
days
passed
and
the
nights
and
more
days
and
more
nights
july
august
on
and
on
and
on
strenuous
surgical
days
broken
maritally
only
by
the
pleasant
greeting
at
the
gate
or
the
practical
homely
appeal
of
good
food
cooked
with
heart
as
well
as
hands
or
the
tingling
inciting
masculine
consciousness
of
there
being
a
woman
blush
in
the
house
strenuous
domestic
days
broken
maritally
only
by
the
jaded
harsh
word
at
the
gate
the
explosive
criticism
of
food
the
deadening
depressing
feminine
consciousness
of
there
being
a
man
vicious
temper
in
the
house
now
and
again
in
one
big
automobile
or
another
the
white
linen
nurse
and
the
senior
surgeon
rode
out
together
always
and
forever
with
the
little
crippled
girl
sitting
between
them
the
other
woman
little
crippled
girl
now
and
again
in
the
late
summer
afternoons
the
white
linen
nurse
and
the
senior
surgeon
strolled
together
through
the
garden
always
and
forever
with
the
little
crippled
girl
the
other
woman
little
crippled
girl
tagging
close
behind
them
with
her
little
sad
clanking
leg
now
and
again
in
the
long
sweet
summer
evenings
the
white
linen
nurse
and
the
senior
surgeon
sat
on
the
porch
together
always
and
forever
with
the
little
crippled
girl
the
other
woman
little
crippled
girl
mocking
them
querulously
from
some
vague
upper
window
now
and
again
across
the
mutually
chasm
that
separated
them
flashed
the
incontrovertible
signal
of
sex
and
sense
as
once
when
a
new
interne
grossly
bungling
stepped
to
the
hospital
window
with
a
colleague
to
watch
the
senior
surgeon
car
roll
away
as
usual
with
its
two
feminine
passengers
what
makes
the
chief
so
stingy
with
that
big
handsome
girl
of
his
queried
the
new
interne
a
bit
resentfully
he
wo
ever
bring
her
into
the
hospital
wo
ever
ask
any
of
us
young
chaps
out
to
his
house
and
some
of
us
come
mighty
near
to
being
eligible
too
who
he
saving
her
for
anyway
a
saint
a
a
millionaire
medicine
man
they
do
exist
you
know
i
saving
her
for
myself
snapped
the
senior
surgeon
most
disconcertingly
from
the
doorway
she
she
happens
to
be
my
wife
not
my
daughter
thank
you
when
the
senior
surgeon
went
home
that
night
he
carried
a
big
bunch
of
magazines
and
a
box
of
candy
as
large
as
his
head
tucked
courtingly
under
his
arm
now
and
again
across
the
chasm
that
separated
them
flashed
the
incontrovertible
signal
of
mutual
trust
and
appreciation
as
when
once
after
a
particularly
violent
vocal
outburst
on
the
senior
part
he
sobered
down
very
suddenly
and
said
rae
malgregor
do
you
realize
that
in
all
the
weeks
we
been
together
you
never
once
nagged
me
about
my
swearing
not
a
word
not
a
single
word
i
not
very
used
to
words
smiled
the
white
linen
nurse
hopefully
all
i
know
how
to
nag
with
is
is
raw
eggs
if
we
could
only
get
those
nerves
of
yours
padded
just
once
sir
the
swearing
would
get
well
of
itself
in
august
the
senior
surgeon
suggested
sincerely
that
the
house
was
much
too
big
for
the
white
linen
nurse
to
run
all
alone
but
conceded
equally
sincerely
under
the
white
linen
nurse
vehement
protest
that
servants
particularly
new
servants
did
creak
considerably
round
a
house
and
that
maybe
just
for
the
present
at
least
until
he
finished
his
very
nervous
paper
on
brain
tumors
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
stay
just
by
ourselves
in
september
the
white
linen
nurse
wanted
very
much
to
go
home
to
nova
scotia
to
her
sister
wedding
but
the
senior
surgeon
was
trying
a
very
complicated
and
worrisome
new
brace
on
the
little
girl
leg
and
it
did
seem
quite
kind
to
go
in
october
she
planned
her
trip
all
over
again
she
was
going
to
take
the
little
crippled
girl
with
her
this
time
but
with
their
trunks
already
packed
and
waiting
in
the
hall
the
senior
surgeon
came
home
from
the
hospital
with
a
septic
finger
and
it
did
seem
quite
best
to
leave
him
well
how
do
you
like
being
married
asked
the
senior
surgeon
a
bit
ironically
in
his
that
night
after
the
white
linen
nurse
had
stood
for
an
hour
with
washes
and
interminable
bandages
trying
to
fix
that
finger
the
precise
particular
way
that
he
thought
it
ought
to
be
fixed
well
how
do
you
like
being
married
he
insisted
trenchantly
oh
i
like
it
all
right
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
a
little
bit
wanly
this
time
she
smiled
her
pluck
up
into
the
senior
questioning
face
oh
i
like
it
all
right
sir
oh
of
course
sir
she
confided
thoughtfully
oh
of
course
sir
it
is
quite
as
fancy
as
being
engaged
or
quite
as
free
and
easy
as
being
single
but
still
she
admitted
with
desperate
honesty
but
still
there
a
sort
of
a
sort
of
a
combination
importance
and
and
comfort
about
it
sir
like
a
like
a
velvet
suit
the
second
year
sir
is
that
all
quizzed
the
senior
surgeon
bluntly
that
all
so
far
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
in
november
the
white
linen
nurse
caught
a
bit
of
cold
that
pulled
her
down
a
little
but
the
senior
surgeon
did
notice
it
specially
among
all
the
virulent
ills
he
lived
and
worked
with
from
day
to
day
and
then
when
the
cold
disappeared
indian
summer
came
like
a
reeking
sweat
after
a
chill
and
the
house
big
and
the
little
crippled
girl
pretty
difficult
to
manage
now
and
then
and
the
senior
surgeon
no
matter
how
hard
he
tried
not
to
did
succeed
somehow
in
creating
more
or
less
of
a
disturbance
at
least
every
other
day
or
two
and
then
suddenly
one
balmy
gold
and
crimson
indian
summer
morning
standing
out
on
the
piazza
trying
to
hear
what
the
little
crippled
girl
was
calling
from
the
window
and
what
the
senior
surgeon
was
calling
from
the
gate
the
white
linen
nurse
fell
right
down
in
her
tracks
brutally
bulkily
like
a
horse
and
lay
as
she
fell
a
huddled
white
heap
across
the
gray
piazza
oh
father
come
quick
come
quick
peach
has
deaded
herself
yelled
the
little
girl
frantic
voice
just
with
his
foot
on
the
step
of
his
car
the
senior
surgeon
heard
the
cry
and
came
speeding
back
up
the
long
walk
already
there
before
him
the
little
girl
knelt
raining
passionate
agonized
kisses
on
her
beloved
playmate
ghastly
white
face
leave
her
alone
thundered
the
senior
surgeon
leave
her
alone
i
say
bruskly
he
pushed
the
little
girl
aside
and
knelt
to
cradle
his
own
ear
against
the
white
linen
nurse
heart
oh
it
all
right
he
growled
and
gathered
the
white
linen
nurse
right
up
in
his
arms
she
was
startlingly
lighter
than
he
had
supposed
and
carried
her
up
the
stairs
and
put
her
to
bed
like
a
child
in
the
great
sumptuous
in
a
great
sumptuous
nest
of
all
the
best
linens
and
blankets
with
the
little
crippled
girl
superintending
the
task
with
many
hysterical
suggestions
and
sharp
staccato
interruptions
for
once
in
his
life
the
senior
surgeon
did
not
stop
to
quarrel
with
his
daughter
rallying
limply
from
her
swoon
the
white
linen
nurse
stared
out
with
hazy
perplexity
at
last
from
her
dimpling
white
pillows
to
see
the
senior
surgeon
standing
amazingly
at
the
bureau
with
a
glass
and
a
in
his
hand
and
the
little
crippled
girl
hanging
apparently
by
her
narrow
peaked
chin
across
the
of
the
bed
gazing
down
worriedly
at
the
sleeve
of
her
the
white
linen
nurse
made
her
first
public
speech
to
the
world
at
large
who
put
me
to
bed
whispered
the
white
linen
nurse
ecstatically
the
little
crippled
girl
began
to
pound
her
fists
on
the
of
the
bed
father
did
she
cried
in
unmistakable
triumph
all
the
little
hooks
all
the
little
buttons
it
cunning
the
senior
surgeon
would
hardly
have
been
human
if
he
had
glanced
back
suddenly
over
his
shoulder
at
the
white
linen
nurse
precipitously
changing
color
quite
irrepressibly
as
he
saw
the
red
red
blood
come
surging
home
again
into
her
cheeks
a
little
short
chuckling
laugh
escaped
him
i
guess
you
live
now
he
remarked
dryly
then
because
a
senior
surgeon
ca
stay
home
on
the
mere
impulse
of
the
moment
from
a
great
rushing
hospital
just
because
one
member
of
his
household
happens
to
faint
perfectly
innocently
in
the
morning
he
hurried
on
to
his
work
again
and
saved
a
little
boy
and
lost
a
little
girl
and
mended
a
fractured
thigh
and
eased
a
wound
and
came
dashing
home
at
noon
in
one
of
his
hours
to
feel
the
white
linen
nurse
pulse
and
broil
her
a
bit
of
tenderloin
steak
with
his
own
hands
and
then
went
dashing
off
again
to
do
one
major
operation
or
another
telephoned
home
once
or
twice
during
the
afternoon
to
make
sure
that
everything
was
all
right
and
finding
that
the
white
linen
nurse
was
comfortably
up
and
about
again
went
sprinting
off
fifty
miles
somewhere
on
a
meningitis
consultation
and
came
dragging
home
at
last
somewhere
near
midnight
to
a
big
black
house
brightened
only
by
a
single
light
in
the
kitchen
where
the
white
linen
nurse
went
tiptoeing
softly
from
stove
to
pantry
in
deft
preparation
of
an
appetizing
supper
for
him
quite
roughly
again
without
smile
or
appreciation
the
senior
surgeon
took
her
by
the
shoulders
and
turned
her
out
of
the
kitchen
and
started
her
up
the
stairs
are
you
an
idiot
he
said
are
you
an
imbecile
he
came
back
and
called
up
the
stairs
to
her
just
as
she
was
disappearing
from
the
upper
landing
then
up
and
down
round
and
round
on
and
on
and
on
the
senior
surgeon
began
suddenly
to
pace
again
only
for
some
unexplainable
reason
to
the
white
linen
nurse
upstairs
his
did
seem
quite
large
enough
for
his
pacing
this
night
along
the
broad
piazza
she
heard
his
footsteps
creak
far
far
into
the
morning
lying
warm
and
snug
in
her
own
little
bed
she
heard
his
footsteps
crackling
through
the
garden
paths
yet
the
senior
surgeon
did
look
an
atom
jaded
or
forlorn
when
he
came
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
he
had
on
a
brand
new
gray
suit
that
fitted
his
big
powerful
shoulders
to
perfection
and
the
glad
glow
of
his
was
still
reddening
faintly
in
his
cheeks
as
he
swung
around
the
corner
of
the
table
and
dropped
down
into
his
place
with
an
odd
little
grin
on
his
lips
directed
intermittently
towards
the
white
linen
nurse
and
the
little
crippled
girl
who
already
waited
him
there
at
either
end
of
the
table
oh
father
is
it
lovely
to
have
my
darling
darling
peach
all
well
again
beamed
the
little
crippled
girl
with
unusual
friendliness
speaking
of
your
peach
said
the
senior
surgeon
quite
abruptly
speaking
of
your
peach
i
going
to
take
her
away
with
me
for
a
week
or
so
eh
jumped
the
little
crippled
girl
what
what
sir
stammered
the
white
linen
nurse
quite
prosily
the
senior
surgeon
began
to
butter
a
piece
of
toast
but
the
little
twinkle
around
his
eyes
belied
in
some
way
the
utter
prosiness
of
the
act
for
a
little
trip
he
confided
amiably
a
little
holiday
a
trifle
excitedly
the
white
linen
nurse
laid
down
her
knife
and
fork
and
stared
at
him
and
wondering
as
a
child
a
holiday
she
gasped
to
a
beach
you
mean
would
there
be
a
a
i
never
seen
a
eh
laughed
the
senior
surgeon
oh
i
going
too
i
going
too
piped
the
little
crippled
girl
most
jerkily
the
senior
surgeon
pushed
back
his
chair
from
the
table
and
swallowed
half
a
cup
of
coffee
at
one
single
gulp
going
you
mean
he
glowered
at
his
little
daughter
going
his
comment
that
ensued
was
distinctly
rough
as
far
as
diction
was
concerned
but
the
facial
expression
of
ineffable
peace
that
accompanied
it
would
have
made
almost
any
phrase
sound
like
a
benediction
not
by
a
damned
sight
beamed
the
senior
surgeon
this
little
trip
is
just
for
peach
and
me
but
sir
fluttered
the
white
linen
nurse
her
face
was
suddenly
pinker
than
any
rose
that
ever
bloomed
with
an
impulse
absolutely
novel
to
him
the
senior
surgeon
turned
and
swung
his
little
daughter
very
gently
to
his
shoulder
your
aunt
agnes
is
coming
to
stay
with
in
just
about
ten
minutes
he
affirmed
that
what
going
to
happen
to
and
maybe
there
be
a
pony
a
white
pony
but
peach
is
so
pleasant
wailed
the
little
crippled
girl
peach
is
so
pleasant
she
began
to
scream
and
kick
so
it
seems
growled
the
senior
surgeon
and
she
dying
of
it
tearfully
the
little
girl
wriggled
down
to
the
ground
and
hobbled
around
and
thrust
her
into
the
white
linen
nurse
blushiest
cheek
i
do
want
peach
to
die
she
admitted
worriedly
but
i
want
anybody
to
take
her
away
the
pony
is
very
white
urged
the
senior
surgeon
with
a
diplomacy
quite
alien
to
him
abruptly
the
little
girl
turned
and
faced
him
what
color
is
aunt
agnes
she
asked
vehemently
aunt
agnes
is
pretty
white
too
attested
the
senior
surgeon
with
the
faintest
possible
tinge
of
superciliousness
the
little
girl
lifted
her
sharp
chin
a
trifle
higher
if
it
just
a
perfectly
plain
white
pony
she
said
i
rather
have
peach
but
if
it
a
white
pony
with
black
blots
on
it
and
if
it
can
pull
a
little
cart
and
if
i
can
whip
it
with
a
little
switch
and
if
it
will
eat
out
of
my
hand
and
if
its
name
is
is
its
name
has
always
been
i
quite
sure
insisted
the
senior
surgeon
inadvertently
as
he
spoke
he
reached
out
and
put
a
hand
very
lightly
on
the
white
linen
nurse
shoulder
instantly
into
the
little
girl
suspicious
face
flushed
a
furiously
uncontrollable
flame
of
jealousy
and
resentment
madly
she
turned
upon
her
father
you
a
liar
she
screamed
there
no
white
pony
you
a
robber
you
a
a
drunk
you
sha
have
my
darling
peach
and
threw
herself
frenziedly
into
the
white
linen
nurse
lap
impatiently
the
senior
surgeon
disentangled
the
little
clinging
arms
and
raising
the
white
linen
nurse
to
her
feet
pushed
her
emphatically
towards
the
hall
go
to
my
he
said
quickly
i
want
to
talk
with
you
a
moment
later
he
joined
her
there
and
shut
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
the
previous
night
loss
of
sleep
showed
plainly
in
his
face
now
and
the
hospital
strain
of
the
day
before
and
of
the
day
before
that
and
of
the
day
before
heavily
moodily
he
crossed
the
room
and
threw
himself
down
in
his
desk
chair
with
the
white
linen
nurse
still
standing
before
him
as
though
she
were
nothing
but
a
white
linen
nurse
all
the
splendor
was
suddenly
gone
from
him
all
the
radiance
all
the
exultant
purpose
well
rae
malgregor
he
grinned
mirthlessly
the
little
kid
is
right
though
i
certainly
do
know
where
she
got
her
information
i
a
liar
the
pony
name
is
not
yet
i
a
drunk
i
was
drunk
most
of
june
i
a
robber
i
have
taken
you
out
of
your
youth
and
the
of
your
youth
and
shut
you
up
here
in
this
great
gloomy
old
house
of
mine
to
be
my
slave
and
my
child
slave
and
pouf
said
the
white
linen
nurse
it
would
seem
silly
now
sir
to
marry
a
boy
and
i
been
a
beast
to
you
persisted
the
senior
surgeon
from
the
very
first
day
you
belonged
to
me
i
been
a
beast
to
you
venting
brutally
on
your
youth
on
your
sweetness
on
your
patience
all
the
work
the
worry
the
wear
and
tear
the
abnormal
strain
and
stress
of
my
disordered
days
and
years
and
i
let
my
little
girl
vent
also
on
you
all
the
pang
and
pain
of
disordered
days
and
because
in
this
great
gloomy
rackety
house
it
seemed
suddenly
like
a
miracle
from
heaven
to
have
service
that
was
i
let
you
shoulder
all
the
hideous
drudgery
the
care
one
horrid
homely
task
after
another
piling
till
you
dropped
in
your
tracks
yesterday
still
smiling
but
i
got
a
good
deal
out
of
it
even
so
sir
protested
the
white
linen
nurse
see
sir
she
smiled
i
got
real
lines
in
my
face
now
like
other
women
i
not
a
doll
any
more
i
not
a
yes
groaned
the
senior
surgeon
and
i
might
just
as
kindly
have
carved
those
lines
with
my
knife
but
i
was
going
to
make
it
all
up
to
you
he
hurried
i
swear
i
was
even
in
one
short
little
week
i
could
have
done
it
you
would
have
known
me
i
was
going
to
take
you
away
just
you
and
me
i
would
have
been
a
saint
i
swear
i
would
i
would
have
given
you
such
a
great
wonderful
holiday
as
you
never
dreamed
of
in
all
your
unselfish
life
a
holiday
all
you
you
you
could
have
dug
in
the
sand
if
you
wanted
to
gad
i
have
dug
in
the
sand
if
you
wanted
me
to
and
now
it
all
gone
from
me
all
the
will
all
the
sheer
positive
that
i
could
have
carried
the
thing
through
absolutely
selflessly
that
little
girl
sneering
taunt
the
ghost
of
her
mother
in
that
taunt
god
when
anybody
knocks
you
just
in
your
decency
it
does
harm
you
specially
but
when
they
knock
you
in
your
it
it
undermines
you
somewhere
i
do
know
exactly
how
i
nothing
but
a
man
again
now
just
a
plain
every
day
greedy
covetous
physical
man
on
the
edge
of
a
holiday
the
first
clean
holiday
in
twenty
years
that
he
no
longer
dares
to
take
a
little
swayingly
the
white
linen
nurse
shifted
her
standing
weight
from
one
foot
to
the
other
i
sorry
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
i
like
to
have
seen
a
sir
just
for
an
instant
a
gleam
of
laughter
went
brightening
across
the
senior
surgeon
brooding
face
and
was
gone
again
rae
malgregor
come
here
he
ordered
quite
sharply
very
softly
very
glidingly
like
the
footfall
of
a
person
who
has
never
known
heels
the
white
linen
nurse
came
forward
swiftly
and
sliding
in
cautiously
between
the
senior
surgeon
and
his
desk
stood
there
with
her
back
braced
against
the
desk
her
fingers
straying
idly
up
and
down
the
edges
of
the
desk
staring
up
into
his
face
all
readiness
all
attention
like
a
soldier
waiting
further
orders
so
near
was
she
that
he
could
almost
hear
the
velvet
of
her
the
little
fluttering
swallow
yet
by
some
strange
persistent
aloofness
of
her
some
determinate
virginity
not
a
fold
of
her
gown
not
an
edge
not
a
thread
seemed
to
even
so
much
as
graze
his
knee
seemed
to
even
so
much
as
shadow
his
hand
lest
it
thereby
the
seething
currents
of
their
variant
emotions
with
extraordinary
intentness
for
a
moment
the
senior
surgeon
sat
staring
into
the
girl
eyes
the
blue
blue
eyes
too
full
of
childish
questioning
yet
to
flinch
with
either
consciousness
or
embarrassment
after
all
rae
malgregor
he
smiled
at
last
faintly
after
all
rae
malgregor
heaven
knows
when
i
shall
ever
get
another
holiday
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
with
apparent
irrelevance
he
reached
for
his
ivory
and
began
bending
it
dangerously
between
his
adept
fingers
how
long
have
you
been
with
me
rae
malgregor
he
asked
quite
abruptly
four
months
actually
with
you
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
do
you
happen
to
remember
the
exact
phrasing
of
my
proposal
of
marriage
to
you
he
asked
shrewdly
oh
yes
sir
said
the
white
linen
nurse
you
called
it
heartwork
for
a
family
of
two
a
little
grimly
before
her
steady
gaze
the
senior
surgeon
own
eyes
fell
and
rallied
again
almost
instantly
with
a
gaze
as
even
and
direct
as
hers
well
he
smiled
through
the
whole
four
months
i
seem
to
have
kept
my
part
of
the
contract
all
right
and
held
you
merely
as
a
drudge
in
my
home
have
you
then
decided
once
and
for
all
time
whether
you
are
going
to
stay
on
with
us
or
whether
you
will
notice
as
other
drudges
have
done
with
a
little
backward
droop
of
one
shoulder
the
white
linen
nurse
began
to
finger
nervously
at
the
desk
behind
her
and
turning
half
way
round
as
though
to
estimate
what
damage
she
was
doing
exposed
thus
merely
the
profile
of
her
pink
face
of
her
white
throat
to
the
senior
questioning
eyes
i
shall
never
give
notice
sir
fluttered
the
white
throat
are
you
perfectly
sure
insisted
the
senior
surgeon
the
pink
in
the
white
linen
nurse
profiled
cheek
deepened
a
little
perfectly
sure
sir
attested
the
carmine
lips
like
the
crack
of
a
pistol
the
senior
surgeon
snapped
the
ivory
paper
cutter
in
two
all
right
then
he
said
rae
malgregor
look
at
me
do
take
your
eyes
from
mine
i
say
rae
malgregor
if
i
should
decide
in
my
own
mind
here
and
now
that
it
was
best
for
you
as
well
as
for
me
that
you
should
come
away
with
me
now
for
this
week
not
as
my
guest
as
i
had
planned
but
as
my
wife
even
if
you
were
not
quite
ready
for
it
in
your
heart
even
if
you
were
not
yet
remotely
ready
for
it
would
you
come
because
i
told
you
to
come
heavily
under
her
white
white
eyelids
heavily
under
her
black
black
lashes
the
girl
eyes
struggled
up
to
meet
his
own
yes
sir
whispered
the
white
linen
nurse
abruptly
the
senior
surgeon
pushed
back
his
chair
from
the
desk
and
stood
up
the
important
decision
once
made
no
further
finessing
of
words
seemed
either
necessary
or
dignified
to
him
go
and
pack
your
quickly
then
he
ordered
i
want
to
get
away
from
here
within
half
an
hour
but
before
the
girl
had
half
crossed
the
room
he
called
to
her
suddenly
his
whole
bearing
and
manner
miraculously
changed
and
his
face
in
that
moment
as
haggard
as
if
a
whole
lifetime
struggle
was
packed
into
it
rae
malgregor
he
drawled
mockingly
this
thing
shall
be
barter
way
through
to
the
end
with
the
credit
always
on
your
side
of
the
account
in
exchange
for
the
gift
of
yourself
your
wonderful
self
and
the
trust
that
goes
with
it
i
will
give
you
god
help
me
the
ugliest
thing
in
my
life
and
god
knows
i
have
broken
faith
with
myself
once
or
twice
but
never
have
i
broken
my
word
to
another
from
now
on
in
token
of
your
trust
in
me
for
whatever
the
bitter
gift
is
worth
to
you
as
long
as
you
stay
with
me
my
junes
shall
be
yours
to
do
with
as
you
please
what
sir
gasped
the
white
linen
nurse
sir
softly
almost
stealthily
she
was
half
way
back
across
the
room
to
him
when
she
stopped
suddenly
and
threw
out
her
arms
with
a
gesture
of
appeal
and
defiance
all
the
same
sir
she
cried
passionately
all
the
same
sir
the
place
is
too
hard
for
the
small
pay
i
get
oh
i
will
do
what
i
promised
she
attested
with
increasing
passion
i
will
never
leave
you
and
i
will
mother
your
little
girl
and
i
will
servant
your
big
house
and
i
will
go
with
you
wherever
you
say
and
i
will
be
to
you
whatever
you
wish
and
i
will
never
flinch
from
any
hardship
you
impose
on
me
nor
whine
over
any
pain
on
and
on
and
on
all
my
days
all
my
years
till
i
drop
in
my
tracks
again
and
die
as
you
say
smiling
all
the
same
she
reiterated
wildly
the
place
is
too
hard
it
always
was
too
hard
it
always
will
be
too
hard
for
such
small
pay
for
such
small
pay
gasped
the
senior
surgeon
around
his
heart
a
horrid
clammy
chill
began
to
settle
sickeningly
through
his
brain
a
dozen
recent
financial
transactions
began
to
rehearse
themselves
you
mean
miss
malgregor
he
said
a
bit
brokenly
you
mean
that
i
have
been
generous
enough
with
you
yes
sir
faltered
the
white
linen
nurse
all
the
storm
and
passion
died
suddenly
from
her
leaving
her
just
a
frightened
girl
again
flushing
before
the
senior
surgeon
scathing
stare
one
step
two
steps
three
she
advanced
towards
him
oh
i
mean
sir
she
whispered
oh
i
mean
sir
that
i
just
an
ordinary
ignorant
country
girl
and
you
are
further
above
me
than
the
moon
from
the
sea
i
could
expect
you
to
love
me
sir
i
even
dream
of
your
loving
me
i
do
think
you
might
like
me
just
a
little
bit
with
your
heart
what
flushed
the
senior
surgeon
against
the
window
pane
sounded
the
little
crippled
girl
knuckled
fists
darkly
against
the
window
pane
squashed
the
little
crippled
girl
staring
face
father
screamed
the
shrill
voice
father
there
a
white
lady
here
with
two
black
ladies
washing
the
breakfast
dishes
is
it
aunt
agnes
with
a
totally
unexpected
laugh
with
a
totally
unexpected
desire
to
laugh
the
senior
surgeon
strode
across
the
room
and
unlocked
his
door
even
then
his
lips
against
the
white
linen
nurse
ear
made
just
a
whisper
not
a
kiss
god
bless
you
he
said
and
let
get
out
of
here
before
any
telephone
message
catches
me
then
almost
calmly
he
walked
out
on
the
piazza
and
greeted
his
hello
agnes
he
said
hello
yourself
smiled
his
how
everything
he
enquired
politely
how
everything
with
you
parried
his
idly
for
a
few
moments
the
senior
surgeon
threw
out
stray
crumbs
of
thought
to
feed
the
conversation
while
smilingly
all
the
while
from
her
luxuriant
east
indian
chair
his
sat
studying
the
general
situation
the
senior
surgeon
was
always
studying
something
last
year
it
was
archaeology
the
year
before
basketry
this
year
it
happened
to
be
eugenics
or
something
funny
like
that
next
year
again
it
might
be
so
you
and
your
pink
and
white
shepherdess
are
going
off
on
a
little
trip
together
she
queried
banteringly
the
girl
a
darling
lendicott
i
have
had
as
much
sport
in
a
long
time
as
i
had
that
afternoon
last
june
when
i
came
in
my
best
and
helped
her
paint
the
kitchen
woodwork
and
i
had
come
prepared
to
be
a
bit
nasty
lendicott
in
all
honesty
lendicott
i
might
just
as
well
up
that
i
had
come
prepared
to
be
just
a
little
bit
nasty
she
seems
to
have
a
way
smiled
the
senior
surgeon
she
seems
to
have
a
way
of
disarming
people
unpleasant
intentions
a
trifle
quizzically
for
an
instant
the
woman
turned
her
face
to
the
senior
surgeon
it
was
a
worldly
face
a
absolutely
worldly
face
with
a
surprisingly
humorous
mouth
that
warmed
her
nature
just
about
as
cheer
fully
and
just
about
as
effectually
as
one
open
fireplace
warms
a
whole
house
nevertheless
one
often
achieved
much
comfort
by
keeping
close
to
aunt
agnes
humorous
mouth
for
aunt
agnes
knew
a
thing
or
two
aunt
agnes
did
and
the
things
that
she
made
a
point
of
knowing
were
conscientiously
amiable
why
lendicott
faber
she
rallied
him
now
why
you
as
nervous
as
a
why
i
believe
i
believe
that
you
going
courting
more
opportunely
than
any
man
could
have
dared
to
hope
the
white
linen
nurse
appeared
suddenly
on
the
scene
in
her
little
blue
serge
with
her
in
her
hand
with
a
gasp
of
relief
the
senior
surgeon
took
her
case
and
his
own
and
went
on
down
the
path
to
his
car
and
his
chauffeur
leaving
the
two
women
temporarily
alone
when
he
returned
to
the
piazza
the
and
the
were
bidding
each
other
a
really
affectionate
and
the
woman
face
looked
suddenly
just
a
little
bit
old
but
the
girl
cheeks
were
most
inordinately
blooming
in
unmistakable
friendliness
his
extended
her
hand
to
him
lendicott
old
man
she
said
and
good
luck
to
you
a
little
slyly
out
of
her
shrewd
gray
eyes
she
glanced
up
sideways
at
him
you
got
the
devil
own
temper
lendicott
dear
she
teased
and
two
or
three
other
vices
probably
and
if
rumor
speaks
the
truth
you
run
more
than
once
in
your
life
but
there
one
thing
i
will
say
for
you
though
it
prove
you
a
dear
stupid
you
never
were
to
suspect
that
any
woman
could
possibly
be
in
love
with
you
to
what
woman
do
you
particularly
refer
mocked
the
senior
surgeon
impatiently
quite
brazenly
to
her
own
heart
which
never
yet
apparently
had
stirred
the
laces
that
enshrined
it
his
pointed
with
persistent
banter
maybe
i
refer
to
myself
she
laughed
and
maybe
to
the
only
other
lady
present
oh
gasped
the
white
linen
nurse
you
do
me
much
honor
agnes
bowed
the
senior
surgeon
quite
resolutely
he
held
his
gaze
from
following
the
white
linen
quickly
averted
face
a
little
oddly
for
an
instant
the
older
woman
glance
hung
on
his
more
honor
perhaps
than
you
think
lendicott
faber
she
said
and
kept
right
on
smiling
eh
jerked
the
senior
surgeon
restively
he
turned
to
the
white
linen
nurse
very
flushingly
on
the
steps
the
white
linen
nurse
knelt
arguing
with
the
little
crippled
girl
your
father
and
i
are
going
away
she
pleaded
you
please
kiss
us
i
only
got
one
kiss
sulked
the
little
crippled
girl
give
it
to
your
father
pleaded
the
white
linen
nurse
amazingly
all
in
a
second
the
ugliness
vanished
from
the
little
face
dartlingly
like
a
bird
the
child
swooped
down
and
planted
one
large
round
kiss
on
the
senior
surgeon
astonished
boot
beautiful
father
she
cried
i
kiss
your
feet
abruptly
the
senior
surgeon
plunged
from
the
step
and
started
down
the
walk
his
were
quite
crimson
two
or
three
rods
behind
him
the
white
linen
nurse
followed
falteringly
once
she
stopped
to
pick
up
a
tiny
stick
or
a
stone
and
once
she
dallied
to
straighten
out
a
snarled
spray
of
red
and
brown
woodbine
missing
the
sound
or
the
shadow
of
her
the
senior
surgeon
turned
suddenly
to
wait
so
startled
was
she
by
his
intentness
so
flustered
so
affrighted
that
just
for
an
instant
the
senior
surgeon
thought
that
she
was
going
to
wheel
in
her
tracks
and
bolt
madly
back
to
the
house
then
quite
unexpectedly
she
gave
an
odd
muffled
little
cry
and
ran
swiftly
to
him
like
a
child
and
slipped
her
bare
hand
trustingly
into
his
and
they
went
on
together
to
the
car
with
his
foot
already
half
lifted
to
the
step
the
senior
surgeon
turned
abruptly
around
and
lifted
his
hat
and
stood
staring
back
bareheaded
for
some
unexplainable
reason
at
the
two
silent
figures
on
the
piazza
rae
he
said
perplexedly
rae
i
do
seem
to
know
just
why
but
somehow
i
like
to
have
you
kiss
your
hand
to
aunt
agnes
obediently
the
white
linen
nurse
withdrew
her
fingers
from
his
and
wafted
two
kisses
one
to
aunt
agnes
and
one
to
the
little
crippled
girl
then
the
white
linen
nurse
and
the
senior
surgeon
climbed
up
into
the
tonneau
of
the
car
where
they
had
never
never
sat
alone
before
and
the
senior
surgeon
gave
a
curt
order
to
his
man
and
the
big
car
started
off
again
into
interminable
spaces
mutely
without
a
word
without
a
glance
passing
between
them
the
senior
surgeon
held
out
his
hand
to
her
once
more
as
though
the
absence
of
her
hand
in
his
was
suddenly
a
lonesomeness
not
to
be
endured
again
while
life
lasted
whizz
whizz
whizz
whirr
whirr
whirr
the
ribbony
road
began
to
roll
up
again
on
that
hidden
spool
under
the
car
when
the
chauffeur
mind
seemed
sufficiently
absorbed
in
speed
and
sound
the
senior
surgeon
bent
down
a
little
mockingly
and
mumbled
his
lips
inarticulately
at
the
white
linen
nurse
see
he
laughed
i
got
a
text
too
to
keep
my
courage
up
of
course
you
look
like
an
angel
he
teased
closer
and
closer
to
her
flaming
face
but
all
the
time
to
myself
to
reassure
myself
i
just
keep
saying
bah
she
nothing
but
a
woman
nothing
but
a
woman
nothing
but
a
woman
within
the
senior
surgeon
warm
firm
grasp
the
white
linen
calm
hand
quickened
suddenly
like
a
bud
forced
precipitously
into
full
bloom
oh
do
talk
sir
she
whispered
oh
do
talk
sir
just
listen
listen
listen
to
what
laughed
the
senior
surgeon
from
under
the
heavy
lashes
that
shadowed
the
flaming
cheeks
the
soul
of
the
girl
who
was
to
be
his
peered
up
at
the
soul
of
the
man
who
was
to
be
hers
saluted
what
she
saw
oh
my
heart
sir
whispered
the
white
linen
nurse
oh
my
heart
my
heart
my
the
end
