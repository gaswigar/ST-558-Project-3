by
the

a

neat
one
and

without

or

this

in
a
corner
of
the

the
following

in

on

the
schooner
anchored
off
pamlico
sound
the
capital
of
north
carolina
one
of
the
states
of
the
union
at
this
epoch
is
the
rather
important
town
of
raleigh
which
is
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
the
interior
of
the
province
it
is
owing
to
its
central
position
that
this
city
has
become
the
seat
of
the
state
legislature
for
there
are
others
that
equal
and
even
surpass
it
in
industrial
and
commercial
importance
such
as
wilmington
charlotte
fayetteville
edenton
washington
salisbury
tarborough
halifax
and
the
latter
town
is
situated
on
estuary
of
the

which
empties
itself
into
pamlico

a
sort
of
vast
maritime
lake
protected
by
a
natural
dyke
formed
by
the
isles
and
islets
of
the
carolina
coast
the
director
of
healthful
house
could
never
have
imagined
why
the
card
should
have
been
sent
to
him
had
it
not
been
accompanied
by
a
note
from
the
count
soliciting
permission
to
visit
the
establishment
the
personage
in
question
hoped
that
the
director
would
grant
his
request
and
announced
that
he
would
present
himself
in
the
afternoon
accompanied
by
captain
spade
commander
of
the
schooner
this
desire
to
penetrate
to
the
interior
of
the
celebrated
sanitarium
then
in
great
request
by
the
wealthy
invalids
of
the
united
states
was
natural
enough
on
the
part
of
a
foreigner
others
who
did
not
bear
such
a
name
as
the
count
had
visited
it
and
had
been
unstinting
in
their
compliments
to
the
director
the
latter
therefore
hastened
to
accord
the
authorization
demanded
and
added
that
he
would
be
honored
to
open
the
doors
of
the
establishment
to
the
count
healthful
house
which
contained
a
select
and
was
assured
of
the
of
the
most
celebrated
doctors
in
the
country
was
a
private
enterprise
independent
of
hospitals
and
almshouses
but
subjected
to
the
surveillance
of
the
state
it
comprised
all
the
conditions
of
comfort
and
salubrity
essential
to
establishments
of
this
description
designed
to
receive
an
opulent
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
a
more
agreeable
situation
than
that
of
healthful
house
on
the
landward
slope
of
a
hill
extended
a
park
of
two
hundred
acres
planted
with
the
magnificent
vegetation
that
grows
so
luxuriantly
in
that
part
of
north
america
which
is
equal
in
latitude
to
the
canary
and
madeira
islands
at
the
furthermost
limit
of
the
park
lay
the
wide
estuary
of
the
neuse
swept
by
the
cool
breezes
of
pamlico
sound
and
by
the
winds
that
blew
from
the
ocean
beyond
the
narrow
of
the
coast
healthful
house
where
rich
invalids
were
cared
for
under
such
excellent
hygienic
conditions
was
more
generally
reserved
for
the
treatment
of
chronic
complaints
but
the
management
did
not
decline
to
admit
patients
affected
by
mental
troubles
when
the
latter
were
not
of
an
incurable
nature
it
thus
happened
a
circumstance
that
was
bound
to
attract
a
good
deal
of
attention
to
healthful
house
and
which
perhaps
was
the
motive
for
the
visit
of
the
count
that
a
person
of
notoriety
had
for
eighteen
months
been
under
special
observation
there
this
person
was
a
frenchman
named
thomas
roch
years
of
age
he
was
beyond
question
suffering
from
some
mental
malady
but
expert
alienists
admitted
that
he
had
not
entirely
lost
the
use
of
his
reasoning
faculties
it
was
only
too
evident
that
he
had
lost
all
notion
of
things
as
far
as
the
ordinary
acts
of
life
were
concerned
but
in
regard
to
subjects
demanding
the
exercise
of
his
genius
his
sanity
was
unimpaired
and
unassailable
a
fact
which
demonstrates
how
true
is
the
that
genius
and
madness
are
often
closely
allied
otherwise
his
condition
manifested
itself
by
complete
loss
of
memory
the
impossibility
of
concentrating
his
attention
upon
anything
lack
of
judgment
delirium
and
incoherence
he
no
longer
even
possessed
the
natural
animal
instinct
of
and
had
to
be
watched
like
an
infant
whom
one
never
permits
out
of
sight
therefore
a
warder
was
detailed
to
keep
close
watch
over
him
by
day
and
by
night
in
pavilion
no
at
the
end
of
healthful
house
park
which
had
been
specially
set
apart
for
him
ordinary
insanity
when
it
is
not
incurable
can
only
be
cured
by
moral
means
medicine
and
therapeutics
are
powerless
and
their
inefficacy
has
long
been
recognized
by
specialists
were
these
moral
means
applicable
to
the
case
of
thomas
roch
one
may
be
permitted
to
doubt
it
even
amid
the
tranquil
and
salubrious
surroundings
of
healthful
house
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
very
symptoms
of
uneasiness
changes
of
temper
irritability
queer
traits
of
character
melancholy
apathy
and
a
repugnance
for
serious
occupations
were
distinctly
apparent
no
treatment
seemed
capable
of
curing
or
even
alleviating
these
symptoms
this
was
patent
to
all
his
medical
attendants
it
has
been
justly
remarked
that
madness
is
an
excess
of
subjectivity
that
is
to
say
a
state
in
which
the
mind
accords
too
much
to
mental
labor
and
not
enough
to
outward
impressions
in
the
case
of
thomas
roch
this
indifference
was
practically
absolute
he
lived
but
within
himself
so
to
speak
a
prey
to
a
fixed
idea
which
had
brought
him
to
the
condition
in
which
we
find
him
could
any
circumstance
occur
to
counteract
it
to
exteriorize
him
as
it
were
the
thing
was
improbable
but
it
was
not
impossible
it
is
now
necessary
to
explain
how
this
frenchman
came
to
quit
france
what
motive
attracted
him
to
the
united
states
why
the
federal
government
had
judged
it
prudent
and
necessary
to
intern
him
in
this
sanitarium
where
every
utterance
that
unconsciously
escaped
him
during
his
crises
were
noted
and
recorded
with
the
minutest
care
eighteen
months
previously
the
secretary
of
the
navy
at
washington
had
received
a
demand
for
an
audience
in
regard
to
a
communication
that
thomas
roch
desired
to
make
to
him
as
soon
as
he
glanced
at
the
name
the
secretary
perfectly
understood
the
nature
of
the
communication
and
the
terms
which
would
accompany
it
and
an
immediate
audience
was
unhesitatingly
accorded
thomas
roch
notoriety
was
indeed
such
that
out
of
solicitude
for
the
interests
confided
to
his
keeping
and
which
he
was
bound
to
safeguard
he
could
not
hesitate
to
receive
the
petitioner
and
listen
to
the
proposals
which
the
latter
desired
personally
to
submit
to
him
thomas
roch
was
an
inventor
an
inventor
of
genius
several
important
discoveries
had
brought
him
prominently
to
the
notice
of
the
world
thanks
to
him
problems
that
had
previously
remained
purely
theoretical
had
received
practical
application
he
occupied
a
conspicuous
place
in
the
front
rank
of
the
army
of
science
it
will
be
seen
how
worry
deceptions
mortification
and
the
outrages
with
which
he
was
overwhelmed
by
the
cynical
wits
of
the
press
combined
to
drive
him
to
that
degree
of
madness
which
necessitated
his
internment
in
healthful
house
his
latest
invention
in
bore
the
name
of
fulgurator
this
apparatus
possessed
if
he
was
to
be
believed
such
superiority
over
all
others
that
the
state
which
acquired
it
would
become
absolute
master
of
earth
and
ocean
the
deplorable
difficulties
inventors
encounter
in
connection
with
their
inventions
are
only
too
well
known
especially
when
they
endeavor
to
get
them
adopted
by
governmental
commissions
several
of
the
most
celebrated
examples
are
still
fresh
in
everybody
memory
it
is
useless
to
insist
upon
this
point
because
there
are
sometimes
circumstances
underlying
affairs
of
this
kind
upon
which
it
is
difficult
to
obtain
any
light
in
regard
to
thomas
roch
however
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
as
in
the
case
of
the
majority
of
his
predecessors
his
pretensions
were
excessive
he
placed
such
an
exorbitant
price
upon
his
new
engine
that
it
was
practicably
impossible
to
treat
with
him
this
was
due
to
the
fact
and
it
should
not
be
lost
sight
of
that
in
respect
of
previous
inventions
which
had
been
most
fruitful
in
result
he
had
been
imposed
upon
with
the
greatest
audacity
being
unable
to
obtain
therefrom
the
profits
which
he
had
a
right
to
expect
his
temper
had
become
soured
he
became
suspicious
would
give
up
nothing
without
knowing
just
what
he
was
doing
impose
conditions
that
were
perhaps
unacceptable
wanted
his
mere
assertions
accepted
as
sufficient
guarantee
and
in
any
case
asked
for
such
a
large
sum
of
money
on
account
before
condescending
to
furnish
the
test
of
practical
experiment
that
his
overtures
could
not
be
entertained
in
the
first
place
he
had
offered
the
fulgurator
to
france
and
made
known
the
nature
of
it
to
the
commission
appointed
to
pass
upon
his
proposition
the
fulgurator
was
a
sort
of
engine
of
peculiar
construction
charged
with
an
explosive
composed
of
new
substances
and
which
only
produced
its
effect
under
the
action
of
a
deflagrator
that
was
also
new
when
this
engine
no
matter
in
what
way
it
was
launched
exploded
not
on
striking
the
object
aimed
at
but
several
hundred
yards
from
it
its
action
upon
the
atmospheric
strata
was
so
terrific
that
any
construction
warship
or
floating
battery
within
a
zone
of
twelve
thousand
square
yards
would
be
blown
to
atoms
this
was
the
principle
of
the
shell
launched
by
the
zalinski
pneumatic
gun
with
which
experiments
had
already
been
made
at
that
epoch
but
its
results
were
multiplied
at
least
a
if
therefore
thomas
roch
invention
possessed
this
power
it
assured
the
offensive
and
defensive
superiority
of
his
native
country
but
might
not
the
inventor
be
exaggerating
notwithstanding
that
the
tests
of
other
engines
he
had
conceived
had
proved
incontestably
that
they
were
all
he
had
claimed
them
to
be
this
experiment
could
alone
show
and
it
was
precisely
here
where
the
rub
came
in
roch
would
not
agree
to
experiment
until
the
millions
at
which
he
valued
his
fulgurator
had
first
been
paid
to
him
it
is
certain
that
a
sort
of
disequilibrium
had
then
occurred
in
his
mental
faculties
it
was
felt
that
he
was
developing
a
condition
of
mind
that
would
gradually
lead
to
definite
madness
no
government
could
possibly
condescend
to
treat
with
him
under
the
conditions
he
imposed
the
french
commission
was
compelled
to
break
off
all
negotiations
with
him
and
the
newspapers
even
those
of
the
radical
opposition
had
to
admit
that
it
was
difficult
to
follow
up
the
affair
in
view
of
the
excess
of
subjectivity
which
was
unceasingly
augmenting
in
the
profoundly
disturbed
mind
of
thomas
roch
no
one
will
be
surprised
at
the
fact
that
the
cord
of
patriotism
gradually
relaxed
until
it
ceased
to
vibrate
for
the
honor
of
human
nature
be
it
said
that
thomas
roch
was
by
this
time
irresponsible
for
his
actions
he
preserved
his
whole
consciousness
only
in
so
far
as
subjects
bearing
directly
upon
his
invention
were
concerned
in
this
particular
he
had
lost
nothing
of
his
mental
power
but
in
all
that
related
to
the
most
ordinary
details
of
existence
his
moral
decrepitude
increased
daily
and
deprived
him
of
complete
responsibility
for
his
acts
thomas
roch
invention
having
been
refused
by
the
commission
steps
ought
to
have
been
taken
to
prevent
him
from
offering
it
elsewhere
nothing
of
the
kind
was
done
and
there
a
great
mistake
was
made
the
inevitable
was
bound
to
happen
and
it
did
under
a
growing
irritability
the
sentiment
of
patriotism
which
is
the
very
essence
of
the
citizen
who
before
belonging
to
himself
belongs
to
his
country
became
extinct
in
the
soul
of
the
disappointed
inventor
his
thoughts
turned
towards
other
nations
he
crossed
the
frontier
and
forgetting
the
ineffaceable
past
offered
the
fulgurator
to
germany
there
as
soon
as
his
exorbitant
demands
were
made
known
the
government
refused
to
receive
his
communication
besides
it
so
happened
that
the
military
authorities
were
just
then
absorbed
by
the
construction
of
a
new
ballistic
engine
and
imagined
they
could
afford
to
ignore
that
of
the
french
inventor
as
the
result
of
this
second
rebuff
roch
anger
became
coupled
with
hatred
an
instinctive
hatred
of
humanity
especially
after
his
with
the
british
admiralty
came
to
naught
the
english
being
practical
people
did
not
at
first
repulse
thomas
roch
they
sounded
him
and
tried
to
get
round
him
but
roch
would
listen
to
nothing
his
secret
was
worth
millions
and
these
millions
he
would
have
or
they
would
not
have
his
secret
the
admiralty
at
last
declined
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
him
it
was
in
these
conditions
when
his
intellectual
trouble
was
growing
daily
worse
that
he
made
a
last
effort
by
approaching
the
american
government
that
was
about
eighteen
months
before
this
story
opens
the
americans
being
even
more
practical
than
the
english
did
not
attempt
to
bargain
for
roch
fulgurator
to
which
in
view
of
the
french
chemist
reputation
they
attached
exceptional
importance
they
rightly
esteemed
him
a
man
of
genius
and
took
the
measures
justified
by
his
condition
prepared
to
indemnify
him
equitably
later
as
thomas
roch
gave
only
too
visible
proofs
of
mental
alienation
the
administration
in
the
very
interest
of
his
invention
judged
it
prudent
to
sequestrate
him
as
is
already
known
he
was
not
confined
in
a
lunatic
asylum
but
was
conveyed
to
healthful
house
which
offered
every
guarantee
for
the
proper
treatment
of
his
malady
yet
though
the
most
careful
attention
had
been
devoted
to
him
no
improvement
had
manifested
itself
thomas
roch
let
it
be
again
remarked
this
point
can
not
be
too
often
insisted
upon
incapable
though
he
was
of
comprehending
and
performing
the
ordinary
acts
and
duties
of
life
recovered
all
his
powers
when
the
field
of
his
discoveries
was
touched
upon
he
became
animated
and
spoke
with
the
assurance
of
a
man
who
knows
whereof
he
is
descanting
and
an
authority
that
carried
conviction
with
it
in
the
heat
of
his
eloquence
he
would
describe
the
marvellous
qualities
of
his
fulgurator
and
the
truly
extraordinary
effects
it
caused
as
to
the
nature
of
the
explosive
and
of
the
deflagrator
the
elements
of
which
the
latter
was
composed
their
manufacture
and
the
way
in
which
they
were
employed
he
preserved
complete
silence
and
all
attempts
to
worm
the
secret
out
of
him
remained
ineffectual
once
or
twice
during
the
height
of
the
paroxysms
to
which
he
was
occasionally
subject
there
had
been
reason
to
believe
that
his
secret
would
escape
him
and
every
precaution
had
been
taken
to
note
his
slightest
utterance
but
thomas
roch
had
each
time
disappointed
his
watchers
if
he
no
longer
preserved
the
sentiment
of
he
at
least
knew
how
to
preserve
the
secret
of
his
discovery
pavilion
no
was
situated
in
the
middle
of
a
garden
that
was
surrounded
by
hedges
and
here
roch
was
accustomed
to
take
exercise
under
the
surveillance
of
his
guardian
this
guardian
lived
in
the
same
pavilion
slept
in
the
same
room
with
him
and
kept
constant
watch
upon
him
never
leaving
him
for
an
hour
he
hung
upon
the
lightest
words
uttered
by
the
patient
in
the
course
of
his
hallucinations
which
generally
occurred
in
the
intermediary
state
between
sleeping
and
waking
watched
and
listened
while
he
dreamed
this
guardian
was
known
as
gaydon
shortly
after
the
sequestration
of
thomas
roch
having
learned
that
an
attendant
speaking
french
fluently
was
wanted
he
had
applied
at
healthful
house
for
the
place
and
had
been
engaged
to
look
after
the
new
inmate
in
reality
the
alleged
gaydon
was
a
french
engineer
named
simon
hart
who
for
several
years
past
had
been
connected
with
a
manufactory
of
chemical
products
in
new
jersey
simon
hart
was
forty
years
of
age
his
high
forehead
was
furrowed
with
the
wrinkle
that
denoted
the
thinker
and
his
resolute
bearing
denoted
energy
combined
with
tenacity
extremely
well
versed
in
the
various
questions
relating
to
the
perfecting
of
modern
armaments
hart
knew
everything
that
had
been
invented
in
the
shape
of
explosives
of
which
there
were
over
eleven
hundred
at
that
time
and
was
fully
able
to
appreciate
such
a
man
as
thomas
roch
he
firmly
believed
in
the
power
of
the
fulgurator
and
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
inventor
had
conceived
an
engine
that
was
capable
of
revolutionizing
the
condition
of
both
offensive
and
defensive
warfare
on
land
and
sea
he
was
aware
that
the
demon
of
insanity
had
respected
the
man
of
science
and
that
in
partially
diseased
brain
the
flame
of
genius
still
burned
brightly
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
during
roch
crises
his
secret
was
revealed
this
invention
of
a
frenchman
would
be
seized
upon
by
some
other
country
to
the
detriment
of
france
impelled
by
a
spirit
of
patriotism
he
made
up
his
mind
to
offer
himself
as
thomas
guardian
by
passing
himself
off
as
an
american
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
french
language
in
order
that
if
the
inventor
did
at
any
time
disclose
his
secret
france
alone
should
benefit
thereby
on
pretext
of
returning
to
europe
he
resigned
his
position
at
the
new
jersey
manufactory
and
changed
his
name
so
that
none
should
know
what
had
become
of
him
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
simon
hart
alias
gaydon
had
been
an
attendant
at
healthful
house
for
fifteen
months
it
required
no
little
courage
on
the
part
of
a
man
of
his
position
and
education
to
perform
the
menial
and
exacting
duties
of
an
insane
man
attendant
but
as
has
been
before
remarked
he
was
actuated
by
a
spirit
of
the
purest
and
noblest
patriotism
the
idea
of
depriving
roch
of
the
legitimate
benefits
due
to
the
inventor
if
he
succeeded
in
learning
his
secret
never
for
an
instant
entered
his
mind
he
had
kept
the
patient
under
the
closest
possible
observation
for
fifteen
months
yet
had
not
been
able
to
learn
anything
from
him
or
worm
out
of
him
a
single
reply
to
his
questions
that
was
of
the
slightest
value
but
he
had
become
more
convinced
than
ever
of
the
importance
of
thomas
roch
discovery
and
was
extremely
apprehensive
lest
the
partial
madness
of
the
inventor
should
become
general
or
lest
he
should
die
during
one
of
his
paroxysms
and
carry
his
secret
with
him
to
the
grave
this
was
simon
hart
position
and
this
the
mission
to
which
he
had
wholly
devoted
himself
in
the
interest
of
his
native
country
however
notwithstanding
his
deceptions
and
troubles
thomas
physical
health
thanks
to
his
vigorous
constitution
was
not
particularly
affected
a
man
of
medium
height
with
a
large
head
high
wide
forehead
features
hair
and
moustache
eyes
generally
haggard
but
which
became
piercing
and
imperious
when
illuminated
by
his
dominant
idea
thin
lips
closely
compressed
as
though
to
prevent
the
escape
of
a
word
that
could
betray
his
secret
such
was
the
inventor
confined
in
one
of
the
pavilions
of
healthful
house
probably
unconscious
of
his
sequestration
and
confided
to
the
surveillance
of
simon
hart
the
engineer
become
gaydon
the
warder
chapter
ii
count
just
who
was
this
count
a
spaniard
so
his
name
would
appear
to
indicate
yet
on
the
stern
of
his
schooner
in
letters
of
gold
was
the
name
which
is
of
pure
norwegian
origin
and
had
you
asked
him
the
name
of
the
captain
of
the
he
would
have
replied
spade
and
would
doubtless
have
added
that
that
of
the
boatswain
was
effrondat
and
that
of
the
ship
cook
helim
all
singularly
dissimilar
and
indicating
very
different
nationalities
could
any
plausible
hypothesis
be
deducted
from
the
type
presented
by
count
not
easily
if
the
color
of
his
skin
his
black
hair
and
the
easy
grace
of
his
attitude
denoted
a
spanish
origin
the
of
his
person
showed
none
of
the
racial
characteristics
peculiar
to
the
natives
of
the
iberian
peninsula
he
was
a
man
of
about
years
of
age
about
the
average
height
and
robustly
constituted
with
his
calm
and
haughty
demeanor
he
resembled
an
hindoo
lord
in
whose
blood
might
mingle
that
of
some
superb
type
of
malay
if
he
was
not
naturally
of
a
cold
temperament
he
at
least
with
his
imperious
gestures
and
brevity
of
speech
endeavored
to
make
it
appear
that
he
was
as
to
the
language
usually
spoken
by
him
and
his
crew
it
was
one
of
those
idioms
current
in
the
islands
of
the
indian
ocean
and
the
adjacent
seas
yet
when
his
maritime
excursions
brought
him
to
the
coasts
of
the
old
or
new
world
he
spoke
english
with
remarkable
facility
and
with
so
slight
an
accent
as
to
scarcely
betray
his
foreign
origin
none
could
have
told
anything
about
his
past
nor
even
about
his
present
life
nor
from
what
source
he
derived
his
fortune
obviously
a
large
one
inasmuch
as
he
was
able
to
gratify
his
every
whim
and
lived
in
the
greatest
luxury
whenever
he
visited
america
nor
where
he
resided
when
at
home
nor
where
was
the
port
from
which
his
schooner
hailed
and
none
would
have
ventured
to
question
him
upon
any
of
these
points
so
little
disposed
was
he
to
be
communicative
he
was
not
the
kind
of
man
to
give
anything
away
or
compromise
himself
in
the
slightest
degree
even
when
interviewed
by
american
reporters
all
that
was
known
about
him
was
what
was
published
in
the
papers
when
the
arrival
of
the
was
reported
in
some
port
and
particularly
in
the
ports
of
the
east
coast
of
the
united
states
where
the
schooner
was
accustomed
to
put
in
at
regular
periods
to
lay
in
provisions
and
stores
for
a
lengthy
voyage
she
would
take
on
board
not
only
flour
biscuits
preserves
fresh
and
dried
meat
live
stock
wines
beers
and
spirits
but
also
clothing
household
utensils
and
objects
of
luxury
all
of
the
finest
quality
and
highest
price
and
which
were
paid
for
either
in
dollars
guineas
or
other
coins
of
various
countries
and
denominations
consequently
if
no
one
knew
anything
about
the
private
life
of
count
he
was
nevertheless
very
well
known
in
the
various
ports
of
the
united
states
from
the
florida
peninsula
to
new
england
it
is
therefore
in
no
way
surprising
that
the
director
of
healthful
house
should
have
felt
greatly
flattered
by
the
count
visit
and
have
received
him
with
every
mark
of
honor
and
respect
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
schooner
had
dropped
anchor
in
the
port
of
and
no
doubt
a
mere
whim
of
her
owner
had
brought
him
to
the
mouth
of
the
neuse
otherwise
why
should
he
have
come
to
such
a
place
certainly
not
to
lay
in
stores
for
pamlico
sound
offered
neither
the
resources
nor
facilities
to
be
found
in
such
ports
as
boston
new
york
dover
savannah
wilmington
in
north
carolina
and
charleston
in
south
carolina
what
could
he
have
procured
with
his
piastres
and
in
the
small
markets
of
this
chief
town
of
craven
county
contained
barely
six
thousand
inhabitants
its
commerce
consisted
principally
in
the
exportation
of
grain
pigs
furniture
and
naval
munitions
besides
a
few
weeks
previously
the
schooner
had
loaded
up
for
some
destination
which
as
usual
was
unknown
had
this
enigmatical
personage
then
come
solely
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
healthful
house
very
likely
there
would
have
been
nothing
surprising
in
the
fact
seeing
that
the
establishment
enjoyed
a
high
and
reputation
or
perhaps
the
count
had
been
inspired
by
curiosity
to
meet
thomas
roch
this
curiosity
would
have
been
legitimate
and
natural
enough
in
view
of
the
universal
renown
of
the
french
inventor
fancy
a
mad
genius
who
claimed
that
his
discoveries
were
destined
to
revolutionize
the
methods
of
modern
military
art
as
he
had
notified
the
director
he
would
do
the
count
presented
himself
in
the
afternoon
at
the
door
of
healthful
house
accompanied
by
captain
spade
the
commander
of
the
in
conformity
with
orders
given
both
were
admitted
and
conducted
to
the
office
of
the
director
the
latter
received
his
distinguished
visitor
with
placed
himself
at
his
disposal
and
intimated
his
intention
of
personally
conducting
him
over
the
establishment
not
being
willing
to
concede
to
anybody
else
the
honor
of
being
his
the
count
on
his
part
was
profuse
in
the
expression
of
his
thanks
for
the
considerations
extended
to
him
they
went
over
the
common
rooms
and
private
habitations
of
the
establishment
the
director
prattling
unceasingly
about
the
care
with
which
the
patients
were
tended
much
better
care
if
he
was
to
be
believed
than
they
could
possibly
have
had
in
the
bosoms
of
their
families
and
priding
himself
upon
the
results
achieved
and
which
had
earned
for
the
place
its
success
the
count
listened
to
his
ceaseless
chatter
with
apparent
interest
probably
in
order
the
better
to
dissemble
the
real
motive
of
his
visit
however
after
going
the
rounds
for
an
hour
he
ventured
to
remark
have
you
not
among
your
patients
sir
one
anent
whom
there
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
some
time
ago
and
whose
presence
here
contributed
in
no
small
measure
to
attract
public
attention
to
healthful
house
you
refer
to
thomas
roch
i
presume
count
queried
the
director
precisely
that
frenchman
that
inventor
whose
mental
condition
is
said
to
be
very
precarious
very
precarious
count
and
happily
so
perhaps
in
my
opinion
humanity
has
nothing
to
gain
by
his
discoveries
the
application
of
which
would
increase
the
already
too
numerous
means
of
destruction
you
speak
wisely
sir
and
i
entirely
agree
with
you
real
progress
does
not
lie
in
that
direction
and
i
regard
as
inimical
to
society
all
those
who
seek
to
follow
it
but
has
this
inventor
entirely
lost
the
use
of
his
intellectual
faculties
entirely
no
save
as
regards
the
ordinary
things
of
life
in
this
respect
he
no
longer
possesses
either
comprehension
or
responsibility
his
genius
as
an
inventor
however
remains
intact
it
has
survived
his
moral
degeneracy
and
had
his
insensate
demands
been
complied
with
i
have
no
doubt
he
would
have
produced
a
new
war
engine
which
the
world
can
get
along
very
well
without
very
well
without
as
you
say
sir
the
count
and
captain
spade
nodded
approval
but
you
will
be
able
to
judge
for
yourself
count
for
here
is
the
pavilion
occupied
by
thomas
roch
if
his
confinement
is
well
justified
from
the
point
of
view
of
public
security
he
is
none
the
less
treated
with
all
the
consideration
due
to
him
and
the
attention
which
his
condition
necessitates
besides
healthful
house
is
beyond
the
reach
of
indiscreet
persons
who
might
the
director
completed
the
phrase
with
a
significant
motion
of
his
head
which
brought
an
imperceptible
smile
to
the
lips
of
the
stranger
but
asked
the
count
is
thomas
roch
never
left
alone
never
count
never
he
has
a
permanent
attendant
in
whom
we
have
implicit
confidence
who
speaks
his
language
and
keeps
the
closest
possible
watch
upon
him
if
in
some
way
or
other
some
indication
relative
to
his
discovery
were
to
escape
him
it
would
be
immediately
noted
down
and
its
value
would
be
passed
upon
by
those
competent
to
judge
here
the
count
stole
a
rapid
and
meaning
glance
at
captain
spade
who
responded
with
a
gesture
which
said
plainly
enough
i
understand
and
had
any
one
observed
the
captain
during
the
visit
they
could
not
have
failed
to
remark
that
he
examined
with
the
greatest
minuteness
that
portion
of
the
park
surrounding
pavilion
no
and
the
different
paths
leading
to
the
latter
probably
in
view
of
some
prearranged
scheme
the
garden
of
the
pavilion
was
near
the
high
wall
surrounding
the
property
from
the
foot
of
which
on
the
other
side
the
hill
sloped
gently
to
the
right
bank
of
the
neuse
the
pavilion
itself
was
a
building
surmounted
by
a
terrace
in
the
italian
style
it
contained
two
rooms
and
an
with
windows
on
each
side
and
in
rear
of
the
habitation
were
clusters
of
fine
trees
which
were
then
in
full
leaf
in
front
was
a
cool
green
velvety
lawn
ornamented
with
shrubs
and
brilliantly
tinted
flowers
the
whole
garden
extended
over
about
half
an
acre
and
was
reserved
exclusively
for
the
use
of
thomas
roch
who
was
free
to
wander
about
it
at
pleasure
under
the
surveillance
of
his
guardian
when
the
count
captain
spade
and
the
director
entered
the
garden
the
first
person
they
saw
was
the
warder
gaydon
standing
at
the
door
of
the
pavilion
unnoticed
by
the
director
the
count
eyed
the
attendant
with
singular
persistence
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
strangers
had
come
to
see
the
occupant
of
pavilion
no
for
the
french
inventor
was
justly
regarded
as
the
most
interesting
inmate
of
healthful
house
nevertheless
attention
was
attracted
by
the
originality
of
the
type
presented
by
the
two
visitors
of
whose
nationality
he
was
ignorant
if
the
name
of
the
count
was
not
unfamiliar
to
him
he
had
never
had
occasion
to
meet
that
wealthy
gentleman
during
the
latter
sojourn
in
the
eastern
ports
he
therefore
had
no
idea
as
to
who
the
count
was
neither
was
he
aware
that
the
schooner
was
then
anchored
at
the
entrance
to
the
neuse
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
upon
which
healthful
house
was
situated
gaydon
demanded
the
director
where
is
thomas
roch
yonder
replied
the
warder
pointing
to
a
man
who
was
walking
meditatively
under
the
trees
in
rear
of
the
pavilion
the
count
has
been
authorized
to
visit
healthful
house
the
director
explained
and
does
not
wish
to
go
away
without
having
seen
thomas
roch
who
was
lately
the
subject
of
a
good
deal
too
much
discussion
and
who
would
be
talked
about
a
great
deal
more
added
the
count
had
the
federal
government
not
taken
the
precaution
to
confine
him
in
this
establishment
a
necessary
precaution
count
necessary
as
you
observe
director
it
is
better
for
the
peace
of
the
world
that
his
secret
should
die
with
him
after
having
glanced
at
the
count
gaydon
had
not
uttered
a
word
but
preceding
the
two
strangers
he
walked
towards
the
clump
of
trees
where
the
inventor
was
pacing
back
and
forth
thomas
roch
paid
no
attention
to
them
he
appeared
to
be
oblivious
of
their
presence
meanwhile
captain
spade
while
being
careful
not
to
excite
suspicion
had
been
minutely
examining
the
immediate
surroundings
of
the
pavilion
and
the
end
of
the
park
in
which
it
was
situated
from
the
top
of
the
sloping
alleys
he
could
easily
distinguish
the
peak
of
a
mast
which
showed
above
the
wall
of
the
park
he
recognized
the
peak
at
a
glance
as
being
that
of
the
and
knew
therefore
that
the
wall
at
this
part
skirted
the
right
bank
of
the
neuse
the
count
whole
attention
was
concentrated
upon
the
french
inventor
the
latter
health
appeared
to
have
suffered
in
no
way
from
his
eighteen
months
confinement
but
his
queer
attitude
his
incoherent
gestures
his
haggard
eye
and
his
indifference
to
what
was
passing
around
him
testified
only
too
plainly
to
the
degeneration
of
his
mental
faculties
at
length
thomas
roch
dropped
into
a
seat
and
with
the
end
of
a
switch
traced
in
the
sand
of
the
alley
the
outline
of
a
fortification
then
kneeling
down
he
made
a
number
of
little
mounds
that
were
evidently
intended
to
represent
bastions
he
next
plucked
some
leaves
from
a
neighboring
tree
and
stuck
them
in
the
mounds
like
so
many
tiny
flags
all
this
was
done
with
the
utmost
seriousness
and
without
any
attention
whatever
being
paid
to
the
onlookers
it
was
the
amusement
of
a
child
but
a
child
would
have
lacked
this
characteristic
gravity
is
he
then
absolutely
mad
demanded
the
count
who
in
spite
of
his
habitual
impassibility
appeared
to
be
somewhat
disappointed
i
warned
you
count
that
nothing
could
be
obtained
from
him
could
he
at
least
pay
some
attention
to
us
it
would
perhaps
be
difficult
to
induce
him
to
do
so
then
turning
to
the
attendant
speak
to
him
gaydon
perhaps
he
will
answer
you
oh
he
answer
me
right
enough
sir
never
fear
replied
gaydon
he
went
up
to
the
inventor
and
touching
him
on
the
shoulder
said
gently
thomas
roch
the
latter
raised
his
head
and
of
the
persons
present
he
doubtless
saw
but
his
keeper
though
captain
spade
had
come
up
and
all
formed
a
circle
about
him
thomas
roch
continued
gaydon
speaking
in
english
here
are
some
visitors
to
see
you
they
are
interested
in
your
health
in
your
work
the
last
word
alone
seemed
to
rouse
him
from
his
indifference
my
work
he
replied
also
in
english
which
he
spoke
like
a
native
then
taking
a
pebble
between
his
index
finger
and
bent
thumb
as
a
boy
plays
at
marbles
he
projected
it
against
one
of
the
little
it
scattered
and
he
jumped
for
joy
blown
to
pieces
the
bastion
is
blown
to
pieces
my
explosive
has
destroyed
everything
at
one
blow
he
shouted
the
light
of
triumph
flashing
in
his
eyes
you
see
said
the
director
addressing
the
count
the
idea
of
his
invention
never
leaves
him
and
it
will
die
with
him
affirmed
the
attendant
could
you
gaydon
get
him
to
talk
about
his
fulgurator
asked
his
chief
i
will
try
if
you
order
me
to
do
so
sir
well
i
do
order
you
for
i
think
it
might
interest
the
count
certainly
assented
the
count
whose
physiognomy
betrayed
no
sign
of
the
sentiments
which
were
agitating
him
i
ought
to
warn
you
that
i
risk
bringing
on
another
fit
observed
gaydon
you
can
drop
the
conversation
when
you
consider
it
prudent
tell
thomas
roch
that
a
foreigner
wishes
to
negotiate
with
him
for
the
purchase
of
his
fulgurator
but
are
you
not
afraid
he
may
give
his
secret
away
questioned
the
count
he
spoke
with
such
vivacity
that
gaydon
could
not
restrain
a
glance
of
distrust
which
however
did
not
appear
to
disturb
the
equanimity
of
that
impenetrable
nobleman
no
fear
of
that
said
the
warder
no
promise
would
induce
him
to
divulge
his
secret
until
the
millions
he
demands
are
counted
into
his
hand
he
will
remain
as
mute
as
a
stone
i
do
happen
to
be
carrying
those
millions
about
me
remarked
the
count
quietly
gaydon
again
touched
roch
on
the
shoulder
and
repeated
thomas
roch
here
are
some
foreigners
who
are
anxious
to
acquire
your
invention
the
madman
started
my
invention
he
cried
my
deflagrator
and
his
growing
animation
plainly
indicated
the
imminence
of
the
fit
that
gaydon
had
been
apprehensive
about
and
which
questions
of
this
character
invariably
brought
on
how
much
will
you
give
me
for
it
how
much
continued
roch
how
much
how
much
ten
million
dollars
replied
gaydon
ten
millions
ten
millions
a
fulgurator
ten
million
times
more
powerful
than
anything
hitherto
invented
ten
millions
for
an
autopropulsive
projectile
which
when
it
explodes
destroys
everything
in
sight
within
a
radius
of
over
twelve
thousand
square
yards
ten
millions
for
the
only
deflagrator
that
can
provoke
its
explosion
why
all
the
wealth
of
the
world
would
suffice
to
purchase
the
secret
of
my
engine
and
rather
than
sell
it
at
such
a
price
i
would
cut
my
tongue
in
half
with
my
teeth
ten
millions
when
it
is
worth
a
billion
a
billion
a
billion
it
was
clear
that
roch
had
lost
all
notion
of
things
and
had
gaydon
offered
him
ten
billions
the
madman
would
have
replied
in
exactly
the
same
manner
the
count
and
captain
spade
had
not
taken
their
eyes
off
him
the
count
was
impassible
as
usual
though
his
brow
had
darkened
but
the
captain
shook
his
head
in
a
manner
that
implied
plainly
decidedly
there
is
nothing
to
hope
from
this
poor
devil
after
his
outburst
roch
fled
across
the
garden
crying
hoarsely
billions
billions
gaydon
turned
to
the
director
and
remarked
i
told
you
how
it
would
be
then
he
rushed
after
his
patient
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
led
him
without
any
attempt
at
resistance
into
the
pavilion
and
closed
the
door
the
count
remained
alone
with
the
director
captain
spade
having
strolled
off
again
in
the
direction
of
the
wall
at
the
bottom
of
the
park
you
see
i
was
not
guilty
of
exaggeration
count
said
the
director
it
is
obvious
to
every
one
that
thomas
roch
is
becoming
daily
worse
in
my
opinion
his
case
is
a
hopeless
one
if
all
the
money
he
asks
for
were
offered
to
him
nothing
could
be
got
from
him
very
likely
replied
the
count
still
if
his
pecuniary
demands
are
supremely
absurd
he
has
none
the
less
invented
an
engine
the
power
of
which
is
infinite
one
might
say
that
is
the
opinion
expressed
by
competent
persons
count
but
what
he
has
discovered
will
ere
long
be
lost
with
himself
in
one
of
these
fits
which
are
becoming
more
frequent
and
intense
very
soon
even
the
motive
of
interest
the
only
sentiment
that
appears
to
have
survived
in
his
mind
will
become
extinct
mayhap
the
sentiment
of
hatred
will
remain
though
muttered
the
count
as
spade
joined
them
at
the
garden
gate
chapter
iii
kidnapped
half
an
hour
later
the
count
and
captain
spade
were
following
the
road
that
separated
the
healthful
house
estate
from
the
right
bank
of
the
neuse
both
had
taken
leave
of
the
director
the
latter
declaring
himself
greatly
honored
by
their
visit
and
the
former
thanking
him
warmly
for
his
courteous
reception
a
bill
left
as
a
tip
for
the
staff
of
the
establishment
had
certainly
not
belied
the
count
reputation
for
generosity
he
was
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
a
foreigner
of
the
highest
distinction
if
distinction
be
measured
by
generosity
issuing
by
the
gate
at
the
main
entrance
to
healthful
house
they
had
skirted
the
wall
that
surrounded
the
property
and
which
was
high
enough
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
climbing
it
not
a
word
passed
between
them
for
some
time
the
count
was
deep
in
thought
and
captain
spade
was
not
in
the
habit
of
addressing
him
without
being
first
spoken
to
at
last
when
they
stood
beneath
the
rear
wall
behind
which
though
it
was
not
visible
the
count
knew
pavilion
no
was
situated
he
said
you
managed
i
presume
to
thoroughly
explore
the
place
and
are
acquainted
with
every
detail
of
it
certainly
replied
captain
spade
emphasizing
the
title
you
are
perfectly
sure
about
it
perfectly
i
could
go
through
the
park
with
my
eyes
shut
if
you
still
persist
in
carrying
out
your
scheme
the
pavilion
can
be
easily
reached
i
do
persist
spade
notwithstanding
thomas
roch
mental
condition
notwithstanding
his
condition
and
if
we
succeed
in
carrying
him
off
that
is
my
affair
when
night
comes
on
i
undertake
to
enter
the
park
of
healthful
house
and
then
the
pavilion
garden
without
being
seen
by
anybody
by
the
entrance
gate
no
on
this
side
yes
but
on
this
side
there
is
the
wall
and
if
you
succeed
in
climbing
it
how
are
you
going
to
get
over
it
again
with
thomas
roch
what
if
the
madman
cries
out
what
if
he
should
resist
what
if
his
keeper
gives
the
alarm
do
worry
yourself
in
the
least
about
that
we
have
only
got
to
go
in
and
come
out
by
this
door
captain
spade
pointed
to
a
narrow
door
let
into
the
wall
a
few
paces
distant
and
which
was
doubtless
used
by
the
staff
of
the
establishment
when
they
had
occasion
to
go
out
by
the
river
that
is
the
way
i
propose
to
go
in
it
much
easier
than
scaling
the
wall
with
a
ladder
but
the
door
is
closed
it
will
open
has
it
no
bolts
yes
but
i
shot
them
back
while
we
were
strolling
about
and
the
director
did
notice
what
i
had
done
how
are
you
going
to
open
it
queried
the
count
going
to
the
door
here
is
the
key
replied
spade
producing
it
he
had
withdrawn
it
from
the
lock
where
it
happened
to
be
when
he
had
unbolted
the
door
capital
exclaimed
the
count
it
could
be
better
the
business
will
be
easier
than
i
expected
let
us
get
back
to
the
schooner
at
eight
one
of
the
boats
will
put
you
ashore
with
five
men
yes
five
men
will
do
said
captain
spade
there
will
be
enough
of
them
to
effect
our
object
even
if
the
keeper
is
aroused
and
it
becomes
necessary
to
put
him
out
of
the
way
put
him
out
of
the
way
well
if
it
becomes
absolutely
necessary
of
course
you
must
but
it
would
be
better
to
seize
him
too
and
bring
him
aboard
the
who
knows
but
what
he
has
already
learned
a
part
of
roch
secret
true
besides
thomas
roch
is
used
to
him
and
i
do
propose
to
make
him
change
his
habitudes
in
any
way
this
observation
was
accompanied
by
such
a
significant
smile
that
captain
spade
could
entertain
no
doubt
as
to
the
rôle
reserved
for
the
warder
of
healthful
house
the
plan
to
kidnap
them
both
was
thus
settled
and
appeared
to
have
every
chance
of
being
successful
unless
during
the
couple
of
hours
of
daylight
that
yet
remained
it
was
noticed
that
the
key
of
the
door
had
been
stolen
and
the
bolts
drawn
back
captain
spade
and
his
men
could
at
least
count
upon
being
able
to
enter
the
park
and
the
rest
the
captain
affirmed
would
be
easy
enough
thomas
roch
was
the
only
patient
in
the
establishment
isolated
and
kept
under
special
surveillance
all
the
other
invalids
lived
in
the
main
building
or
occupied
pavilions
in
the
front
of
the
park
the
plan
was
to
try
and
seize
roch
and
gaydon
separately
and
bind
and
gag
them
before
they
could
cry
out
the
count
and
his
companion
wended
their
way
to
a
creek
where
one
of
the
boats
awaited
them
the
schooner
was
anchored
two
cable
lengths
from
the
shore
her
sails
neatly
rolled
upon
her
yards
which
were
squared
as
neatly
as
those
of
a
pleasure
yacht
or
of
a
at
the
peak
of
the
mainmast
a
narrow
red
pennant
was
gently
swayed
by
the
wind
which
came
in
fitful
puffs
from
the
east
the
count
and
the
captain
jumped
into
the
boat
and
a
few
strokes
of
the
four
oars
brought
them
alongside
of
the
schooner
they
climbed
on
deck
and
going
forward
to
the
leaned
over
the
starboard
bulwark
and
gazed
at
an
object
that
floated
on
the
water
a
few
strokes
ahead
of
the
vessel
it
was
a
small
buoy
that
was
rocked
by
the
ripple
of
the
ebbing
tide
twilight
gradually
set
in
and
the
outline
of
on
the
left
bank
of
the
sinuous
neuse
became
more
and
more
indistinct
until
it
disappeared
in
the
deepening
shades
of
night
a
mist
set
in
from
the
sea
but
though
it
obscured
the
moon
it
brought
no
sign
of
rain
the
lights
gleamed
out
one
by
one
in
the
houses
of
the
town
the
fishing
smacks
came
slowly
up
the
river
to
their
anchorage
impelled
by
the
oars
of
their
crews
which
struck
the
water
with
sharp
rhythmical
strokes
and
with
their
sails
distended
on
the
chance
of
catching
an
occasional
puff
of
the
dropping
wind
to
help
them
along
a
couple
of
steamers
passed
sending
up
volumes
of
black
smoke
and
myriads
of
sparks
from
their
double
stacks
and
lashing
the
water
into
foam
with
their
powerful
paddles
at
eight
the
count
appeared
on
the
schooner
deck
accompanied
by
a
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
to
whom
he
remarked
it
is
time
to
go
serko
very
well
i
will
tell
spade
replied
serko
at
that
moment
the
captain
joined
them
you
had
better
get
ready
to
go
said
the
count
all
is
ready
be
careful
to
prevent
any
alarm
being
given
and
arrange
matters
so
that
no
one
will
for
a
minute
suspect
that
thomas
roch
and
his
keeper
have
been
brought
on
board
the
they
would
find
them
if
they
came
to
look
for
them
observed
serko
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
laughing
heartily
as
though
he
had
perpetrated
a
huge
joke
nevertheless
it
is
better
not
to
arouse
their
suspicion
said
the
boat
was
lowered
and
captain
spade
and
five
sailors
took
their
places
in
it
four
of
the
latter
got
out
the
oars
the
boatswain
effrondat
who
was
to
remain
in
charge
of
the
boat
went
to
the
stern
beside
captain
spade
and
took
the
tiller
good
luck
spade
said
serko
with
a
smile
and
do
make
more
noise
about
it
than
if
you
were
a
gallant
carrying
off
his
i
wo
unless
that
gaydon
chap
we
must
have
both
roch
and
gaydon
insisted
the
count
that
is
understood
replied
spade
the
boat
pushed
off
and
the
sailors
on
the
deck
of
the
schooner
watched
it
till
it
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
darkness
pending
its
return
no
preparations
for
the
departure
were
made
perhaps
there
was
no
intention
of
quitting
the
port
after
the
men
had
been
kidnapped
besides
how
could
the
vessel
have
reached
the
open
sea
not
a
breath
of
air
was
now
stirring
and
in
half
an
hour
the
tide
would
be
setting
in
again
and
rising
strongly
and
rapidly
for
several
miles
above
anchored
as
has
already
been
said
a
couple
of
from
the
shore
the
might
have
been
brought
much
nearer
to
it
for
the
water
was
deep
enough
and
this
would
have
facilitated
the
task
of
the
kidnappers
when
they
returned
from
their
expedition
if
however
the
count
preferred
to
let
the
vessel
stay
where
she
was
he
probably
had
his
reasons
not
a
soul
was
in
sight
on
the
bank
and
the
road
with
its
borders
of
beech
trees
that
skirted
the
wall
of
healthful
house
estate
was
equally
deserted
the
boat
was
made
fast
to
the
shore
then
captain
spade
and
his
four
sailors
landed
leaving
the
boatswain
in
charge
and
disappeared
amid
the
trees
when
they
reached
the
wall
captain
spade
stopped
and
the
sailors
drew
up
on
each
side
of
the
doorway
the
captain
had
only
to
turn
the
key
in
the
lock
and
push
the
door
unless
one
of
the
servants
noticing
that
the
door
was
not
secured
as
usual
had
bolted
it
in
this
event
their
task
would
be
an
extremely
difficult
one
even
if
they
succeeded
in
scaling
the
high
wall
the
captain
put
his
ear
to
the
and
listened
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
in
the
park
not
even
a
leaf
was
rustling
in
the
branches
of
the
beeches
under
which
they
were
standing
the
surrounding
country
was
wrapt
in
the
profoundest
silence
captain
spade
drew
the
key
from
his
pocket
inserted
it
in
the
lock
and
turned
it
noiselessly
then
he
cautiously
pushed
the
door
which
opened
inward
things
were
then
just
as
he
had
left
them
and
no
one
had
noticed
the
theft
of
the
key
after
assuring
himself
that
nobody
happened
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
pavilion
the
captain
entered
followed
by
his
men
the
door
was
left
wide
open
so
that
they
could
beat
a
hurried
and
uninterrupted
retreat
in
case
of
necessity
the
trees
and
bushes
in
this
shady
part
of
the
park
were
very
thick
and
it
was
so
dark
that
it
would
not
have
been
easy
to
distinguish
the
pavilion
had
not
a
light
shone
brightly
in
one
of
the
windows
no
doubt
this
was
the
window
of
the
room
occupied
by
roch
and
his
guardian
gaydon
seeing
that
the
latter
never
left
the
patient
placed
in
his
charge
either
by
night
or
day
captain
spade
had
expected
to
find
him
there
the
party
approached
cautiously
taking
the
utmost
precaution
to
avoid
kicking
a
pebble
or
stepping
on
a
twig
the
noise
of
which
might
have
revealed
their
presence
in
this
way
they
reached
the
door
of
the
pavilion
near
which
was
the
curtained
window
of
the
room
in
which
the
light
was
burning
but
if
the
door
was
locked
how
were
they
going
to
get
in
captain
spade
must
have
asked
himself
he
had
no
key
and
to
attempt
to
effect
an
entrance
through
the
window
would
be
hazardous
for
unless
gaydon
could
be
prevented
from
giving
the
alarm
he
would
rouse
the
whole
establishment
there
was
no
help
for
it
however
the
essential
was
to
get
possession
of
roch
if
they
could
kidnap
gaydon
too
in
conformity
with
the
intentions
of
the
count
so
much
the
better
if
not
captain
spade
crept
stealthily
to
the
window
and
standing
on
tiptoe
looked
in
through
an
aperture
in
the
curtain
he
could
see
all
over
the
room
gaydon
was
standing
beside
thomas
roch
who
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
fit
with
which
he
had
been
attacked
during
the
count
visit
his
condition
necessitated
special
attention
and
the
warder
was
ministering
to
the
patient
under
the
direction
of
a
third
person
the
latter
was
one
of
the
doctors
attached
to
healthful
house
and
had
been
at
once
sent
to
the
pavilion
by
the
director
when
paroxysm
came
on
his
presence
of
course
rendered
the
situation
more
complicated
and
the
work
of
the
kidnappers
more
difficult
roch
fully
dressed
was
extended
upon
a
sofa
he
was
now
fairly
calm
the
paroxysm
which
was
abating
would
be
followed
by
several
hours
of
torpor
and
exhaustion
just
as
captain
spade
peeped
through
the
window
the
doctor
was
making
preparations
to
leave
the
captain
heard
him
say
to
gaydon
that
his
the
doctor
presence
was
not
likely
to
be
required
any
more
that
night
and
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
beyond
following
the
instructions
he
had
given
the
doctor
then
walked
towards
the
door
which
it
will
be
remembered
was
close
to
the
window
in
front
of
which
spade
and
his
men
were
standing
if
they
remained
where
they
were
they
could
not
fail
to
be
seen
not
only
by
the
doctor
but
by
the
warder
who
was
accompanying
him
to
the
door
before
they
made
their
appearance
however
the
sailors
at
a
sign
from
their
chief
had
dispersed
and
hidden
themselves
behind
the
bushes
while
spade
himself
crouched
in
the
shadow
beneath
the
window
luckily
gaydon
had
not
brought
the
lamp
with
him
so
that
the
captain
was
in
no
danger
of
being
seen
as
he
was
about
to
take
leave
of
gaydon
the
doctor
stopped
on
the
step
and
remarked
this
is
one
of
the
worst
attacks
our
patient
has
had
one
or
two
more
like
that
and
he
will
lose
the
little
reason
he
still
possesses
just
so
said
gaydon
i
wonder
that
the
director
does
prohibit
all
visitors
from
entering
the
pavilion
roch
owes
his
present
attack
to
a
count
for
whose
amusement
harmful
questions
were
put
to
him
i
will
call
the
director
attention
to
the
matter
responded
the
doctor
he
then
descended
the
steps
and
gaydon
leaving
the
door
of
the
pavilion
ajar
accompanied
him
to
the
end
of
the
path
when
they
had
gone
captain
spade
stood
up
and
his
men
rejoined
him
had
they
not
better
profit
by
the
chance
thus
unexpectedly
afforded
them
to
enter
the
room
and
secure
roch
who
was
in
a
condition
and
then
await
gaydon
return
and
seize
the
warder
as
he
entered
this
would
have
involved
considerable
risk
gaydon
at
a
glance
would
perceive
that
his
patient
was
missing
and
raise
an
alarm
the
doctor
would
come
running
back
the
whole
staff
of
healthful
house
would
turn
out
and
spade
would
not
have
time
to
escape
with
his
precious
prisoner
and
lock
the
door
in
the
wall
after
him
he
did
not
have
much
chance
to
deliberate
about
it
for
the
warder
was
heard
returning
along
the
gravel
path
spade
decided
that
the
best
thing
to
be
done
was
to
spring
upon
him
as
he
passed
and
stifle
his
cries
and
overpower
him
before
he
could
attempt
to
offer
any
resistance
the
carrying
off
of
the
mad
inventor
would
be
easy
enough
inasmuch
as
he
was
unconscious
and
could
not
raise
a
finger
to
help
himself
gaydon
came
round
a
clump
of
bushes
and
approached
the
entrance
to
the
pavilion
as
he
raised
his
foot
to
mount
the
steps
the
four
sailors
sprang
upon
him
bore
him
backwards
to
the
ground
and
had
gagged
him
securely
bound
him
hand
and
foot
and
bandaged
his
eyes
before
he
began
to
realize
what
had
happened
two
of
the
men
then
kept
guard
over
him
while
captain
spade
and
the
others
entered
the
house
as
the
captain
had
surmised
thomas
roch
had
sunk
into
such
a
torpor
that
he
could
have
heard
nothing
of
what
had
been
going
on
outside
reclining
at
full
length
with
his
eyes
closed
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
dead
man
but
for
his
heavy
breathing
there
was
no
need
either
to
bind
or
gag
him
one
man
took
him
by
the
head
and
another
by
the
feet
and
started
off
with
him
to
the
schooner
captain
spade
was
the
last
to
quit
the
house
after
extinguishing
the
lamp
and
closing
the
door
behind
him
in
this
way
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
inmates
would
be
missed
before
morning
gaydon
was
carried
off
in
the
same
way
as
thomas
roch
had
been
the
two
remaining
sailors
lifted
him
and
bore
him
quietly
but
rapidly
down
the
path
to
the
door
in
the
wall
the
park
was
pitch
dark
not
even
a
glimmer
of
the
lights
in
the
windows
of
healthful
house
could
be
seen
through
the
thick
foliage
arrived
at
the
wall
spade
who
had
led
the
way
stepped
aside
to
allow
the
sailors
with
their
burdens
to
pass
through
then
followed
and
closed
and
locked
the
door
he
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
intending
to
throw
it
into
the
neuse
as
soon
as
they
were
safely
on
board
the
schooner
there
was
no
one
on
the
road
nor
on
the
bank
of
the
river
the
party
made
for
the
boat
and
found
that
effrondat
the
boatswain
had
made
all
ready
to
receive
them
thomas
roch
and
gaydon
were
laid
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
the
sailors
again
took
their
places
at
the
oars
hurry
up
effrondat
and
cast
off
the
painter
ordered
the
captain
the
boatswain
obeyed
and
pushed
the
boat
off
with
his
foot
as
he
scrambled
in
the
men
bent
to
their
oars
and
rowed
rapidly
to
the
schooner
which
was
easily
distinguishable
having
hung
out
a
light
at
her
mizzenmast
head
in
two
minutes
they
were
alongside
the
count
was
leaning
on
the
bulwarks
by
the
gangway
all
right
spade
he
questioned
yes
sir
all
right
both
of
them
both
the
madman
and
his
keeper
does
anybody
know
about
it
up
at
healthful
house
not
a
soul
it
was
not
likely
that
gaydon
whose
eyes
and
ears
were
bandaged
but
who
preserved
all
his
could
have
recognized
the
voices
of
the
count
and
captain
spade
nor
did
he
have
the
chance
to
no
attempt
was
immediately
made
to
hoist
him
on
board
he
had
been
lying
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
alongside
the
schooner
for
fully
half
an
hour
he
calculated
before
he
felt
himself
lifted
and
then
lowered
doubtless
to
the
bottom
of
the
hold
the
kidnapping
having
been
accomplished
it
would
seem
that
it
only
remained
for
the
to
weigh
anchor
descend
the
estuary
and
make
her
way
out
to
sea
through
pamlico
sound
yet
no
preparations
for
departure
were
made
was
it
not
dangerous
to
stay
where
they
were
after
their
daring
raid
had
the
count
hidden
his
prisoners
so
securely
as
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
their
being
discovered
if
the
whose
presence
in
proximity
to
healthful
house
could
not
fail
to
excite
suspicion
received
a
visit
from
the
police
however
this
might
have
been
an
hour
after
the
return
of
the
expedition
every
soul
on
board
save
the
watch
the
count
serko
and
captain
spade
in
their
respective
cabins
and
the
crew
in
the
were
sound
asleep
chapter
iv
the
schooner
ebba
it
was
not
till
the
next
morning
and
then
very
leisurely
that
the
began
to
make
preparations
for
her
departure
from
the
extremity
of
quay
the
crew
might
have
been
seen
holystoning
the
deck
after
which
they
loosened
the
reef
lines
under
the
direction
of
effrondat
the
boatswain
hoisted
in
the
boats
and
cleared
the
halyards
at
eight
the
count
had
not
yet
appeared
on
deck
his
companion
serko
the
engineer
as
he
was
called
on
board
had
not
quitted
his
cabin
captain
spade
was
strolling
quietly
about
giving
orders
the
would
have
made
a
splendid
racing
yacht
though
she
had
never
participated
in
any
of
the
yacht
races
either
on
the
north
american
or
british
coasts
the
height
of
her
masts
the
extent
of
the
canvas
she
carried
her
shapely
raking
hull
denoted
her
to
be
a
craft
of
great
speed
and
her
general
lines
showed
that
she
was
also
built
to
weather
the
roughest
gales
at
sea
in
a
favorable
wind
she
would
probably
make
twelve
knots
an
hour
notwithstanding
these
advantages
however
she
must
in
a
dead
calm
necessarily
suffer
from
the
same
disadvantages
as
other
sailing
vessels
and
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
the
count
would
have
preferred
a
with
which
he
could
have
gone
anywhere
at
any
time
in
any
weather
but
apparently
he
was
satisfied
to
stick
to
the
old
method
even
when
he
made
his
long
trips
across
the
atlantic
on
this
particular
morning
the
wind
was
blowing
gently
from
the
west
which
was
very
favorable
to
the
and
would
enable
her
to
stand
straight
out
of
the
neuse
across
pamlico
sound
and
through
one
of
the
inlets
that
led
to
the
open
sea
at
ten
the
was
still
rocking
lazily
at
anchor
her
stem
up
stream
and
her
cable
tautened
by
the
rapidly
ebbing
tide
the
small
buoy
that
on
the
previous
evening
had
been
moored
near
the
schooner
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
and
had
doubtless
been
hoisted
in
suddenly
a
gun
boomed
out
and
a
slight
wreath
of
white
smoke
arose
from
the
battery
it
was
answered
by
other
reports
from
the
guns
on
the
chain
of
islands
along
the
coast
at
this
moment
the
count
and
engineer
serko
appeared
on
deck
captain
spade
went
to
meet
them
guns
barking
he
said
laconically
we
expected
it
replied
serko
shrugging
his
shoulders
they
are
signals
to
close
the
passes
what
has
that
to
do
with
us
asked
the
count
quietly
nothing
at
all
said
the
engineer
they
all
of
course
knew
that
the
indicated
that
the
disappearance
of
thomas
roch
and
the
warder
gaydon
from
healthful
house
had
been
discovered
at
daybreak
the
doctor
had
gone
to
pavilion
no
to
see
how
his
patient
had
passed
the
night
and
had
found
no
one
there
he
immediately
notified
the
director
who
had
the
grounds
thoroughly
searched
it
was
then
discovered
that
the
door
in
rear
of
the
park
was
unbolted
and
that
though
locked
the
key
had
been
taken
away
it
was
evident
that
roch
and
his
attendant
had
been
carried
out
that
way
but
who
were
the
kidnappers
no
one
could
possibly
imagine
all
that
could
be
ascertained
was
that
at
seven
on
the
previous
night
one
of
the
doctors
had
attended
thomas
roch
who
was
suffering
from
one
of
his
fits
and
that
when
the
medical
man
had
left
him
the
invalid
was
in
an
unconscious
condition
what
had
happened
after
the
doctor
took
leave
of
gaydon
at
the
end
of
the
could
not
even
be
conjectured
the
news
of
the
disappearance
was
telegraphed
to
new
berne
and
thence
to
raleigh
on
receipt
of
it
the
governor
had
instantly
wired
orders
that
no
vessel
was
to
be
allowed
to
quit
pamlico
sound
without
having
been
first
subjected
to
a
most
rigorous
search
another
dispatch
ordered
the
cruiser
which
was
stationed
in
the
port
to
carry
out
the
governor
instructions
in
this
respect
at
the
same
time
measures
were
taken
to
keep
a
strict
lookout
in
every
town
and
village
in
the
state
the
count
could
see
the
which
was
a
couple
of
miles
away
to
the
east
in
the
estuary
getting
steam
up
and
making
hurried
preparations
to
carry
out
her
mission
it
would
take
at
least
an
hour
before
the
warship
could
be
got
ready
to
steam
out
and
the
schooner
might
by
that
time
have
gained
a
good
start
shall
i
weigh
anchor
demanded
captain
spade
yes
as
we
have
a
fair
wind
but
you
can
take
your
time
about
it
replied
the
count
the
passes
of
pamlico
sound
will
be
under
observation
observed
engineer
serko
and
no
vessel
will
be
able
to
get
out
without
receiving
a
visit
from
gentlemen
as
inquisitive
as
they
will
be
indiscreet
never
mind
get
under
way
all
the
same
ordered
the
count
when
the
officers
of
the
cruiser
or
the
officers
have
been
over
the
the
embargo
will
be
raised
i
shall
be
indeed
surprised
if
we
are
not
allowed
to
go
about
our
business
with
a
thousand
pardons
for
the
liberty
taken
and
best
wishes
for
a
good
voyage
and
speedy
return
chuckled
engineer
serko
following
the
phrase
with
a
loud
and
prolonged
laugh
when
the
news
was
received
at
the
authorities
at
first
were
puzzled
to
know
whether
the
missing
inventor
and
his
keeper
had
fled
or
been
carried
off
as
however
roch
flight
could
not
have
taken
place
without
the
connivance
of
gaydon
this
supposition
was
speedily
abandoned
in
the
opinion
of
the
director
and
management
of
healthful
house
the
warder
was
absolutely
above
suspicion
they
must
both
then
have
been
kidnapped
it
can
easily
be
imagined
what
a
sensation
the
news
caused
in
the
town
what
the
french
inventor
who
had
been
so
closely
guarded
had
disappeared
and
with
him
the
secret
of
the
wonderful
fulgurator
that
nobody
had
been
able
to
worm
out
of
him
might
not
the
most
serious
consequences
follow
might
not
the
discovery
of
the
new
engine
be
lost
to
america
forever
if
the
daring
act
had
been
perpetrated
on
behalf
of
another
nation
might
not
that
nation
having
thomas
roch
in
its
power
be
eventually
able
to
extract
from
him
what
the
federal
government
had
vainly
endeavored
to
obtain
and
was
it
reasonable
was
it
permissible
to
suppose
for
an
instant
that
he
had
been
carried
off
for
the
benefit
of
a
private
individual
certainly
not
was
the
emphatic
reply
to
the
latter
question
which
was
too
ridiculous
to
be
entertained
therefore
the
whole
power
of
the
state
was
employed
in
an
effort
to
recover
the
inventor
in
every
county
of
north
carolina
a
special
surveillance
was
organized
on
every
road
and
at
every
railroad
station
and
every
house
in
town
and
country
was
searched
every
port
from
wilmington
to
norfolk
was
closed
and
no
craft
of
any
description
could
leave
without
being
thoroughly
overhauled
not
only
the
cruiser
but
every
available
cutter
and
launch
was
sent
out
with
orders
to
patrol
pamlico
sound
and
board
yachts
merchant
vessels
and
fishing
smacks
indiscriminately
whether
anchored
or
not
and
search
them
down
to
the
keelson
still
the
crew
of
the
prepared
calmly
to
weigh
anchor
and
the
count
did
not
appear
to
be
in
the
least
concerned
at
the
orders
of
the
authorities
and
at
the
consequences
that
would
ensue
if
thomas
roch
and
his
keeper
gaydon
were
found
on
board
at
last
all
was

the
crew
manned
the
capstan
bars
the
sails
were
hoisted
and
the
schooner
glided
gracefully
through
the
water
towards
the
sound
twenty
miles
from
the
estuary
curves
abruptly
and
shoots
off
towards
the
northwest
for
about
the
same
distance
gradually
widening
until
it
empties
itself
into
pamlico
sound
the
latter

a
vast
expanse
about
seventy
miles
across
from
sivan
island
to
roanoke
on
the
seaward
side

a
chain
of
long
and
narrow
islands
forming
a
natural
breakwater

to
cape
hatteras
and
from
the

to
cape
henry

numerous
beacons
on
the

an
easy
guide
for
vessels
at
night
seeking
refuge
from
the
atlantic
gales
and
once
inside
the

they
are
certain
of
finding

next
is
the
inlet
of
hatteras
there
are
also
three
others
known
as
logger
head
inlet
new
inlet
and
oregon
inlet
the
ocracoke
was
the
one
nearest
the
and
she
could
make
it
without
tacking
but
the
was
searching
all
vessels
that
passed
through
this
did
not
however
make
any
particular
difference
for
by
this
time
all
the
passes
upon
which
the
guns
of
the
forts
had
been
trained
were
guarded
by
government
vessels
the
therefore
kept
on
her
way
neither
trying
to
avoid
nor
offering
to
approach
the
searchers
she
seemed
to
be
merely
a
out
for
a
morning
sail
no
attempt
had
up
to
that
time
been
made
to
accost
her
was
she
then
specially
privileged
and
to
be
spared
the
bother
of
being
searched
was
the
count
considered
too
high
and
mighty
a
personage
to
be
thus
molested
and
delayed
even
for
an
hour
it
was
unlikely
for
though
he
was
regarded
as
a
distinguished
foreigner
who
lived
the
life
of
luxury
enjoyed
by
the
favored
of
fortune
no
one
as
a
matter
of
fact
knew
who
he
was
nor
whence
he
came
nor
whither
he
was
going
the
schooner
sped
gracefully
over
the
calm
waters
of
the
sound
her

crescent
in
the
angle
of
a
red
field
streaming
proudly
in
the
breeze
count
was
cosily
ensconced
in
a
chair
on
the
conversing
with
engineer
serko
and
captain
spade
they
do
seem
in
a
hurry
to
board
us
remarked
serko
they
can
come
whenever
they
think
proper
said
the
count
in
a
tone
of
supreme
indifference
no
doubt
they
are
waiting
for
us
at
the
entrance
to
the
inlet
suggested
captain
spade
let
them
wait
grunted
the
wealthy
nobleman
then
he
relapsed
into
his
customary
unconcerned
impassibility
captain
spade
hypothesis
was
doubtless
correct
the
had
as
yet
made
no
move
towards
the
schooner
but
would
almost
certainly
do
so
as
soon
as
the
latter
reached
the
inlet
and
the
count
would
have
to
submit
to
a
search
of
his
vessel
if
he
wished
to
reach
the
open
sea
how
was
it
then
that
he
manifested
such
extraordinary
unconcern
were
thomas
roch
and
gaydon
so
safely
hidden
that
their
could
not
possibly
be
discovered
the
thing
was
possible
but
perhaps
the
count
would
not
have
been
quite
so
confident
had
he
been
aware
that
the
had
been
specially
signalled
to
the
warship
and
revenue
cutters
as
a
suspect
the
count
visit
to
healthful
house
on
the
previous
day
had
now
attracted
particular
attention
to
him
and
his
schooner
evidently
at
the
time
the
director
could
have
had
no
reason
to
suspect
the
motive
of
his
visit
but
a
few
hours
later
thomas
roch
and
his
keeper
had
been
carried
off
no
one
else
from
outside
had
been
near
the
pavilion
that
day
it
was
admitted
that
it
would
have
been
an
easy
matter
for
the
count
companion
while
the
former
distracted
the
attention
to
push
back
the
bolts
of
the
door
in
the
wall
and
steal
the
key
then
the
fact
that
the
was
anchored
in
rear
of
and
only
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
estate
was
in
itself
suspicious
nothing
would
have
been
easier
for
the
desperadoes
than
to
enter
by
the
door
surprise
their
victims
and
carry
them
off
to
the
schooner
these
suspicions
neither
the
director
nor
the
of
the
establishment
had
at
first
liked
to
give
expression
to
but
when
the
was
seen
to
weigh
anchor
and
head
for
the
open
sea
they
appeared
to
be
confirmed
they
were
communicated
to
the
authorities
of
who
immediately
ordered
the
commander
of
the
to
intercept
the
schooner
to
search
her
minutely
high
and
low
and
from
stem
to
stern
and
on
no
account
to
let
her
proceed
unless
he
was
absolutely
certain
that
roch
and
gaydon
were
not
on
board
assuredly
the
count
could
have
had
no
idea
that
his
vessel
was
the
object
of
such
stringent
orders
but
even
if
he
had
it
is
questionable
whether
this
superbly
haughty
and
disdainful
nobleman
would
have
manifested
any
particular
anxiety
towards
three
the
warship
which
was
cruising
before
the
inlet
after
having
sent
search
parties
aboard
a
few
suddenly
manoeuvred
to
the
entrance
of
the
pass
and
awaited
the
approaching
schooner
the
latter
surely
did
not
imagine
that
she
could
force
a
passage
in
spite
of
the
cruiser
or
escape
from
a
vessel
propelled
by
steam
besides
had
she
attempted
such
a
foolhardy
trick
a
couple
of
shots
from
the
guns
would
speedily
have
constrained
her
to
lay
to
presently
a
boat
manned
by
two
officers
and
ten
sailors
put
off
from
the
cruiser
and
rowed
towards
the
when
they
were
only
about
half
a
cable
length
off
one
of
the
men
rose
and
waved
a
flag
that
a
signal
to
stop
said
engineer
serko
precisely
remarked
the
count
we
shall
have
to
lay
to
then
lay
to
captain
spade
went
forward
and
gave
the
necessary
orders
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
vessel
slackened
speed
and
was
soon
merely
drifting
with
the
tide
the
boat
pulled
alongside
and
a
man
in
the
bows
held
on
to
her
with
a
the
gangway
was
lowered
by
a
couple
of
hands
on
the
schooner
and
the
two
officers
followed
by
eight
of
their
men
climbed
on
deck
they
found
the
crew
of
the
drawn
up
in
line
on
the
forecastle
the
officer
in
command
of
the
a
first
lieutenant
advanced
towards
the
owner
of
the
schooner
and
the
following
questions
and
answers
were
exchanged
this
schooner
belongs
to
the
count
to
whom
i
presume
i
have
the
honor
of
speaking
yes
sir
what
is
her
name
the
she
is
commanded
by
captain
spade
what
is
his
nationality
the
officer
scrutinized
the
schooner
flag
while
the
count
added
will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
sir
to
what
circumstance
i
owe
the
pleasure
of
your
visit
on
board
my
vessel
orders
have
been
received
replied
the
officer
to
search
every
vessel
now
anchored
in
pamlico
sound
or
which
attempts
to
leave
it
he
did
not
deem
it
necessary
to
insist
upon
this
point
since
the
above
every
other
was
to
be
subjected
to
the
bother
of
a
rigorous
examination
you
of
course
sir
have
no
intention
of
refusing
me
permission
to
go
over
your
schooner
assuredly
not
sir
my
vessel
is
at
your
disposal
from
peaks
to
bilges
only
i
should
like
to
know
why
all
the
vessels
which
happen
to
be
in
pamlico
sound
are
being
subjected
to
this
formality
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
not
be
informed
monsieur
the
count
replied
the
officer
the
governor
of
north
carolina
has
been
apprised
that
healthful
house
has
been
broken
into
and
two
persons
kidnapped
and
the
authorities
merely
wish
to
satisfy
themselves
that
the
persons
carried
off
have
not
been
embarked
during
the
night
is
it
possible
exclaimed
the
count
feigning
surprise
and
who
are
the
persons
who
have
thus
disappeared
from
healthful
house
an
inventor
a
madman
and
his
keeper
a
madman
sir
do
you
may
i
ask
refer
to
the
frenchman
thomas
roch
the
same
the
thomas
roch
whom
i
saw
yesterday
during
my
visit
to
the
establishment
whom
i
questioned
in
presence
of
the
director
who
was
seized
with
a
violent
paroxysm
just
as
captain
spade
and
i
were
leaving
the
officer
observed
the
stranger
with
the
keenest
attention
in
an
effort
to
surprise
anything
suspicious
in
his
attitude
or
remarks
it
is
incredible
added
the
count
as
though
he
had
just
heard
about
the
outrage
for
the
first
time
i
can
easily
understand
sir
how
uneasy
the
authorities
must
be
he
went
on
in
view
of
thomas
roch
personality
and
i
can
not
but
approve
of
the
measures
taken
i
need
hardly
say
that
neither
the
french
inventor
nor
his
keeper
is
on
board
the
however
you
can
assure
yourself
of
the
fact
by
examining
the
schooner
as
minutely
as
you
desire
captain
spade
show
these
gentlemen
over
the
vessel
then
saluting
the
lieutenant
of
the
coldly
the
count
sank
into
his
again
and
replaced
his
cigar
between
his
lips
while
the
two
officers
and
eight
sailors
conducted
by
captain
spade
began
their
search
in
the
first
place
they
descended
the
main
hatchway
to
the
after
saloon
a
place
filled
with
art
objects
of
great
value
hung
with
rich
tapestries
and
hangings
and
wainscotted
with
costly
woods
it
goes
without
saying
that
this
and
the
adjoining
cabins
were
searched
with
a
care
that
could
not
have
been
surpassed
by
the
most
experienced
detectives
moreover
captain
spade
assisted
them
by
every
means
in
his
power
obviously
anxious
that
they
should
not
preserve
the
slightest
suspicion
of
the
owner
after
the
grand
saloon
and
cabins
the
elegant
was
visited
then
the
cook
galley
captain
spade
cabin
and
the
quarters
of
the
crew
in
the
forecastle
were
overhauled
but
no
sign
of
thomas
roch
or
gaydon
was
to
be
seen
next
every
inch
of
the
hold
was
examined
with
the
aid
of
a
couple
of
lanterns
wine
brandy
whisky
and
beer
barrels
in
fact
all
the
provision
boxes
and
everything
the
hold
contained
including
the
stock
of
coal
was
moved
and
probed
and
even
the
bilges
were
scrutinized
but
all
in
vain
evidently
the
suspicion
that
the
count
had
carried
off
the
missing
men
was
unfounded
and
unjust
even
a
rat
could
not
have
escaped
the
notice
of
the
vigilant
searchers
leave
alone
two
men
when
they
returned
on
deck
however
the
officers
as
a
matter
of
precaution
looked
into
the
boats
hanging
on
the
davits
and
punched
the
lowered
sails
with
the
same
result
it
only
remained
for
them
therefore
to
take
leave
of
the
count
you
must
pardon
us
for
having
disturbed
you
monsieur
the
count
said
the
lieutenant
you
were
compelled
to
obey
your
orders
gentlemen
it
was
merely
a
formality
of
course
ventured
the
officer
by
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
the
count
signified
that
he
was
quite
willing
to
accept
this
euphemism
i
assure
you
gentlemen
that
i
have
had
no
hand
in
this
kidnapping
we
can
no
longer
believe
so
monsieur
the
count
and
will
withdraw
as
you
please
is
the
now
free
to
proceed
certainly
then
gentlemen
for
i
am
an
of
this
coast
and
shall
soon
be
back
again
i
hope
that
ere
my
return
you
will
have
discovered
the
author
of
the
outrage
and
have
thomas
roch
safely
back
in
healthful
house
it
is
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wished
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states
i
might
even
say
of
the
whole
world
the
two
officers
courteously
saluted
the
count
who
responded
with
a
nod
captain
spade
accompanied
them
to
the
gangway
and
they
were
soon
making
for
the
cruiser
which
had
steamed
near
to
pick
them
up
meanwhile
the
breeze
had
freshened
considerably
and
when
at
a
sign
from
captain
spade
set
sail
again
the
skimmed
swiftly
through
the
inlet
and
half
an
hour
after
was
standing
out
to
sea
for
an
hour
she
continued
steering
and
then
the
wind
being
merely
a
land
breeze
dropped
and
the
schooner
lay
becalmed
her
sails
limp
and
her
flag
drooping
like
a
wet
rag
it
seemed
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
vessel
to
continue
her
voyage
that
night
unless
a
breeze
sprang
up
and
of
this
there
was
no
sign
since
the
schooner
had
cleared
the
inlet
captain
spade
had
stood
in
the
bows
gazing
into
the
water
now
to
port
now
to
starboard
as
if
on
the
lookout
for
something
presently
he
shouted
in
a
stentorian
voice
furl
sail
the
sailors
rushed
to
their
posts
and
in
an
instant
the
sails
came
rattling
down
and
were
furled
was
it
count
intention
to
wait
there
till
daybreak
brought
a
breeze
with
it
presumably
or
the
sails
would
have
remained
hoisted
to
catch
the
faintest
puff
a
boat
was
lowered
and
captain
spade
jumped
into
it
accompanied
by
a
sailor
who
paddled
it
towards
an
object
that
was
floating
on
the
water
a
few
yards
away
this
object
was
a
small
buoy
similar
to
that
which
had
floated
on
the
bosom
of
the
neuse
when
the
lay
off
healthful
house
the
buoy
with
a
towline
affixed
to
it
was
lifted
into
the
boat
that
was
then
paddled
to
the
bow
of
the
from
the
deck
of
which
another
hawser
was
cast
to
the
captain
who
made
it
fast
to
the
towline
of
the
buoy
having
dropped
the
latter
overboard
again
the
captain
and
the
sailor
returned
to
the
ship
and
the
boat
was
hoisted
in
almost
immediately
the
hawser
tautened
and
the
though
not
a
stitch
of
canvas
had
been
set
sped
off
in
an
easterly
direction
at
a
speed
that
could
not
have
been
less
than
ten
knots
an
hour
night
was
falling
fast
and
soon
the
rapidly
receding
lights
along
the
american
coast
were
lost
in
the
mist
on
the
horizon

notes
by
simon
hart
the
engineer
where
am
i
what
has
happened
since
the
sudden
aggression
of
which
i
was
the
victim
near
the
pavilion
i
had
just
quitted
the
doctor
and
was
about
to
mount
the
steps
close
the
door
and
resume
my
post
beside
thomas
roch
when
several
men
sprang
upon
me
and
knocked
me
down
who
are
they
my
eyes
having
been
bandaged
i
was
unable
to
recognize
them
i
could
not
cry
for
help
having
been
gagged
i
could
make
no
resistance
for
they
had
bound
me
hand
and
foot
thus
powerless
i
felt
myself
lifted
and
carried
about
one
hundred
paces
then
hoisted
then
lowered
then
laid
down
where
where
and
thomas
roch
what
has
become
of
him
it
must
have
been
he
rather
than
i
they
were
after
i
was
but
gaydon
the
warder
none
suspected
that
i
was
simon
hart
the
engineer
nor
could
they
have
suspected
my
nationality
why
therefore
should
they
have
desired
to
kidnap
a
mere
hospital
attendant
there
can
consequently
be
no
doubt
that
the
french
inventor
has
been
carried
off
and
if
he
was
snatched
from
healthful
house
it
must
have
been
in
the
hope
of
forcing
his
secret
from
him
but
i
am
reasoning
on
the
supposition
that
thomas
roch
was
carried
off
with
me
is
it
so
yes
it
must
be
it
is
i
can
entertain
no
doubt
whatever
about
it
i
have
not
fallen
into
the
hands
of
malefactors
whose
only
intention
is
robbery
they
would
not
have
acted
in
this
way
after
rendering
it
impossible
for
me
to
cry
out
after
having
thrown
me
into
a
clump
of
bushes
in
the
corner
of
the
garden
after
having
kidnapped
thomas
roch
they
would
not
have
shut
me
up
where
i
now
am
where
this
is
the
question
which
i
have
been
asking
myself
for
hours
without
being
able
to
answer
it
however
one
thing
is
certain
and
that
is
that
i
have
embarked
upon
an
extraordinary
adventure
that
will
end
in
what
manner
i
know
not
i
dare
not
even
imagine
what
the
upshot
of
it
will
be
anyhow
it
is
my
intention
to
commit
to
memory
minute
by
minute
the
least
circumstance
and
then
if
it
be
possible
to
jot
down
my
daily
impressions
who
knows
what
the
future
has
in
store
for
me
and
who
knows
but
what
in
my
new
position
i
may
finally
discover
the
secret
of
roth
fulgurator
if
i
am
to
be
delivered
one
day
this
secret
must
be
made
known
as
well
as
who
is
the
author
or
who
are
the
authors
of
this
criminal
outrage
which
may
be
attended
with
such
serious
consequences
i
continually
revert
to
this
question
hoping
that
some
incident
will
occur
to
enlighten
me
where
am
i
let
me
begin
from
the
beginning
after
having
been
carried
by
the
head
and
feet
from
healthful
house
i
felt
that
i
was
laid
without
any
brutality
i
must
admit
upon
the
stretchers
of
a
of
small
dimensions
the
rocking
caused
by
the
weight
of
my
body
was
succeeded
shortly
afterwards
by
a
further
rocking
which
i
attribute
to
the
embarking
of
a
second
person
can
there
be
room
for
doubt
that
it
was
thomas
roch
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
they
would
not
have
had
to
take
the
precaution
of
gagging
him
or
of
bandaging
his
eyes
or
of
binding
him
he
must
still
have
been
in
a
state
of
prostration
which
precluded
the
possibility
of
his
making
any
resistance
or
even
of
being
conscious
of
what
was
being
done
the
proof
that
i
am
not
deceiving
myself
is
that
i
could
smell
the
unmistakable
odor
of
ether
now
yesterday
before
taking
leave
of
us
the
doctor
administered
a
few
drops
of
ether
to
the
invalid
and
i
remember
distinctly
a
little
of
this
extremely
volatile
substance
fell
upon
his
clothing
while
he
was
struggling
in
his
fit
there
is
therefore
nothing
astonishing
in
the
fact
that
this
odor
should
have
clung
to
him
nor
that
i
should
have
distinguished
it
even
beneath
the
bandages
that
covered
my
face
yes
thomas
roch
was
extended
near
me
in
the
boat
and
to
think
that
had
i
not
returned
to
the
pavilion
when
i
did
had
i
delayed
a
few
minutes
longer
i
should
have
found
him
gone
let
me
think
what
could
have
inspired
that
count
with
the
unfortunate
curiosity
to
visit
healthful
house
if
he
had
not
been
allowed
to
see
my
patient
nothing
of
the
kind
would
have
happened
talking
to
thomas
roch
about
his
inventions
brought
on
a
fit
of
exceptional
violence
the
director
is
primarily
to
blame
for
not
heeding
my
warning
had
he
listened
to
me
the
doctor
would
not
have
been
called
upon
to
attend
him
the
door
of
the
pavilion
would
have
been
locked
and
the
attempt
of
the
band
would
have
been
frustrated
as
to
the
interest
there
could
have
been
in
carrying
off
thomas
roch
either
on
behalf
of
a
private
person
or
of
one
of
the
states
of
the
old
world
it
is
so
evident
that
there
is
no
need
to
dwell
upon
it
however
i
can
be
perfectly
easy
about
the
result
no
one
can
possibly
succeed
in
learning
what
for
fifteen
months
i
have
been
unable
to
ascertain
in
the
condition
of
intellectual
collapse
into
which
my
has
fallen
all
attempts
to
force
his
secret
from
him
will
be
futile
moreover
he
is
bound
to
go
from
bad
to
worse
until
he
is
hopelessly
insane
even
as
regards
those
points
upon
which
he
has
hitherto
preserved
his
reason
intact
after
all
however
it
is
less
about
thomas
roch
than
myself
that
i
must
think
just
now
and
this
is
what
i
have
experienced
to
resume
the
thread
of
my
adventure
where
i
dropped
it
after
more
rocking
caused
by
our
captors
jumping
into
it
the
boat
is
rowed
off
the
distance
must
be
very
short
for
a
minute
after
we
bumped
against
something
i
surmise
that
this
something
must
be
the
hull
of
a
ship
and
that
we
have
run
alongside
there
is
some
scurrying
and
excitement
indistinctly
through
my
bandages
i
can
hear
orders
being
given
and
a
confused
murmur
of
voices
that
lasts
for
about
five
minutes
but
i
can
not
distinguish
a
word
that
is
said
the
only
thought
that
occurs
to
me
now
is
that
they
will
hoist
me
on
board
and
lower
me
to
the
bottom
of
the
hold
and
keep
me
there
till
the
vessel
is
far
out
at
sea
obviously
they
will
not
allow
either
thomas
roch
or
his
keeper
to
appear
on
deck
as
long
as
she
remains
in
pamlico
sound
my
conjecture
is
correct
still
gagged
and
bound
i
am
at
last
lifted
by
the
legs
and
shoulders
my
impression
however
is
that
i
am
not
being
raised
over
a
ship
bulwark
but
on
the
contrary
am
being
lowered
are
they
going
to
drop
me
overboard
to
drown
like
a
rat
so
as
to
get
rid
of
a
dangerous
witness
this
thought
flashes
into
my
brain
and
a
quiver
of
anguish
passes
through
my
body
from
head
to
foot
instinctively
i
draw
a
long
breath
and
my
lungs
are
filled
with
the
precious
air
they
will
speedily
lack
no
there
is
no
immediate
cause
for
alarm
i
am
laid
with
comparative
gentleness
upon
a
hard
floor
which
gives
me
the
sensation
of
metallic
coldness
i
am
lying
at
full
length
to
my
extreme
surprise
i
find
that
the
ropes
with
which
i
was
bound
have
been
untied
and
loosened
the
tramping
about
around
me
has
ceased
the
next
instant
i
hear
a
door
closed
with
a
bang
where
am
i
and
in
the
first
place
am
i
alone
i
tear
the
gag
from
my
mouth
and
the
bandages
from
my
head
it
is
dark
pitch
dark
not
a
ray
of
light
not
even
the
vague
perception
of
light
that
the
eyes
preserve
when
the
lids
are
tightly
closed
i
shout
i
shout
repeatedly
no
response
my
voice
is
smothered
the
air
i
breathe
is
hot
heavy
thick
and
the
working
of
my
lungs
will
become
difficult
impossible
unless
the
store
of
air
is
renewed
i
extend
my
arms
and
feel
about
me
and
this
is
what
i
conclude
i
am
in
a
compartment
with
walls
which
can
not
measure
more
than
four
cubic
yards
i
can
feel
that
the
walls
are
of
bolted
plates
like
the
sides
of
a
ship
compartment
i
can
feel
that
the
entrance
to
it
is
by
a
door
on
one
side
for
the
hinges
protrude
somewhat
this
door
must
open
inwards
and
it
is
through
here
no
doubt
that
i
was
carried
in
i
place
my
ear
to
the
door
but
not
a
sound
can
be
heard
the
silence
is
as
profound
as
the
obscurity
a
strange
silence
that
is
only
broken
by
the
sonorousness
of
the
metallic
floor
when
i
move
about
none
of
the
dull
noises
usually
to
be
heard
on
board
a
ship
is
perceptible
not
even
the
rippling
of
the
water
along
the
hull
nor
is
there
the
slightest
movement
to
be
felt
yet
in
the
estuary
of
the
neuse
the
current
is
always
strong
enough
to
cause
a
marked
oscillation
to
any
vessel
but
does
the
compartment
in
which
i
am
confined
really
belong
to
a
ship
how
do
i
know
that
i
am
afloat
on
the
neuse
though
i
was
conveyed
a
short
distance
in
a
boat
might
not
the
latter
instead
of
heading
for
a
ship
in
waiting
for
it
opposite
healthful
house
have
been
rowed
to
a
point
further
down
the
river
in
this
case
is
it
not
possible
that
i
was
carried
into
the
cellar
of
a
house
this
would
explain
the
complete
immobility
of
the
compartment
it
is
true
that
the
walls
are
of
bolted
plates
and
that
there
is
a
vague
smell
of
salt
water
that
odor
which
generally
pervades
the
interior
of
a
ship
and
which
there
is
no
mistaking
an
interval
which
i
estimate
at
about
four
hours
must
have
passed
since
my
incarceration
it
must
therefore
be
near
midnight
shall
i
be
left
here
in
this
way
till
morning
luckily
i
dined
at
six
which
is
the
regular
at
healthful
house
i
am
not
suffering
from
hunger
in
fact
i
feel
more
inclined
to
sleep
than
to
eat
still
i
hope
i
shall
have
energy
enough
to
resist
the
inclination
i
will
not
give
way
to
it
i
must
try
and
find
out
what
is
going
on
outside
but
neither
sound
nor
light
can
penetrate
this
iron
box
wait
a
minute
though
perhaps
by
listening
intently
i
may
hear
some
sound
however
feeble
therefore
i
concentrate
all
my
vital
power
in
my
sense
of
hearing
moreover
i
try
in
case
i
should
really
not
be
on
to
distinguish
some
movement
some
oscillation
of
my
prison
admitting
that
the
ship
is
still
at
anchor
it
can
not
be
long
before
it
will
start
otherwise
i
shall
have
to
give
up
imagining
why
thomas
roch
and
i
have
been
carried
off
at
last
it
is
no
illusion
a
slight
rolling
proves
to
me
beyond
a
doubt
that
i
am
not
on
land
we
are
evidently
moving
but
the
motion
is
scarcely
perceptible
it
is
not
a
jerky
but
rather
a
gliding
movement
as
though
we
were
skimming
through
the
water
without
effort
on
an
even
keel
let
me
consider
the
matter
calmly
i
am
on
board
a
vessel
that
was
anchored
in
the
neuse
waiting
under
sail
or
steam
for
the
result
of
the
expedition
a
boat
brought
me
aboard
but
i
repeat
i
did
not
feel
that
i
was
lifted
over
her
bulwarks
was
i
passed
through
a
porthole
but
after
all
what
does
it
matter
whether
i
was
lowered
into
the
hold
or
not
i
am
certainly
upon
something
that
is
floating
and
moving
no
doubt
i
shall
soon
be
let
out
together
with
thomas
roch
supposing
them
to
have
locked
him
up
as
carefully
as
they
have
me
by
being
let
out
i
mean
being
accorded
permission
to
go
on
deck
it
will
not
be
for
some
hours
to
come
however
that
is
certain
for
they
wo
want
us
to
be
seen
so
that
there
is
no
chance
of
getting
a
whiff
of
fresh
air
till
we
are
well
out
at
sea
if
it
is
a
sailing
vessel
she
must
have
waited
for
a
breeze
for
the
breeze
that
freshens
off
shore
at
daybreak
and
is
favorable
to
ships
navigating
pamlico
sound
it
certainly
can
not
be
a
steamer
i
could
not
have
failed
to
smell
the
oil
and
other
odors
of
the
and
then
i
should
feel
the
trembling
of
the
machinery
the
jerks
of
the
pistons
and
the
movements
of
the
screws
or
paddles
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
wait
patiently
i
sha
be
taken
out
of
this
hole
until
anyway
moreover
if
i
am
not
released
somebody
will
surely
bring
me
something
to
eat
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
they
intend
to
starve
me
to
death
they
would
have
taken
the
trouble
to
bring
me
aboard
but
would
have
dropped
me
to
the
bottom
of
the
river
had
they
been
desirous
of
getting
rid
of
me
once
we
are
out
at
sea
what
will
they
have
to
fear
from
me
no
one
could
hear
my
shouts
as
to
demanding
an
explanation
and
making
a
fuss
it
would
be
useless
besides
what
am
i
to
the
men
who
have
carried
us
off
a
mere
hospital
attendant
one
gaydon
who
is
of
no
consequence
it
is
thomas
roch
they
were
after
i
was
taken
along
too
because
i
happened
to
return
to
the
pavilion
at
the
critical
moment
at
any
rate
no
matter
what
happens
no
matter
who
our
kidnappers
may
be
no
matter
where
we
are
taken
i
shall
stick
to
this
resolution
i
will
continue
to
play
my
role
of
warder
no
one
no
none
can
suspect
that
gaydon
is
simon
hart
the
engineer
there
are
two
advantages
in
this
in
the
first
place
they
will
take
no
notice
of
a
poor
devil
of
a
warder
and
in
the
second
i
may
be
able
to
solve
the
mystery
surrounding
this
plot
and
turn
my
knowledge
to
profit
if
i
succeed
in
making
my
escape
but
whither
are
my
thoughts
wandering
i
must
perforce
wait
till
we
arrive
at
our
destination
before
thinking
of
escaping
it
will
be
time
enough
to
bother
about
that
when
the
occasion
presents
itself
until
then
the
essential
is
that
they
remain
ignorant
as
to
my
identity
and
they
can
not
and
shall
not
know
who
i
am
i
am
now
certain
that
we
are
going
through
the
water
but
there
is
one
thing
that
puzzles
me
it
is
not
a
sailing
vessel
neither
can
it
be
a
steamer
yet
it
is
incontestably
propelled
by
some
powerful
machine
there
are
none
of
the
noises
nor
is
there
the
trembling
that
accompanies
the
working
of
steam
engines
the
movement
of
the
vessel
is
more
continuous
and
regular
it
is
a
sort
of
direct
rotation
that
is
communicated
by
the
motor
whatever
the
latter
may
be
no
mistake
is
possible
the
ship
is
propelled
by
some
special
mechanism
but
what
is
it
is
it
one
of
those
turbines
that
have
been
spoken
of
lately
which
fitted
into
a
submerged
tube
are
destined
to
replace
the
ordinary
screw
it
being
claimed
that
they
utilize
the
resistance
of
the
water
better
than
the
latter
and
give
increased
speed
to
a
ship
in
a
few
hours
time
i
shall
doubtless
know
all
about
this
means
of
locomotion
meanwhile
there
is
another
thing
that
equally
puzzles
me
there
is
not
the
slightest
rolling
or
pitching
how
is
it
that
pamlico
sound
is
so
extraordinarily
calm
the
varying
currents
continuously
ruffle
the
surface
of
the
sound
even
if
nothing
else
does
it
is
true
the
tide
may
be
out
and
i
remember
that
last
night
the
wind
had
fallen
altogether
still
no
matter
the
thing
is
inexplicable
for
a
ship
propelled
by
machinery
no
matter
at
what
speed
she
may
be
going
always
oscillates
more
or
less
and
i
can
not
perceive
the
slightest
rocking
such
are
the
thoughts
with
which
my
mind
is
persistently
filled
despite
an
almost
overpowering
desire
to
sleep
despite
the
torpor
that
is
coming
upon
me
in
this
suffocating
atmosphere
i
am
resolved
not
to
close
my
eyes
i
will
keep
awake
till
daylight
and
there
will
be
no
daylight
for
me
till
it
is
let
into
my
prison
from
the
outside
perhaps
even
if
the
door
were
open
it
would
not
penetrate
to
this
black
hole
and
i
shall
probably
not
see
it
again
until
i
am
taken
on
deck
i
am
squatting
in
a
corner
of
my
prison
for
i
have
no
stool
or
anything
to
sit
upon
but
as
my
eyelids
are
heavy
and
i
feel
somnolent
in
spite
of
myself
i
get
up
and
walk
about
then
i
wax
wrathful
anger
fills
my
soul
i
beat
upon
the
iron
walls
with
my
fists
and
shout
for
help
in
vain
i
hurt
my
hands
against
the
bolts
of
the
plates
and
no
one
answers
my
cries
such
conduct
is
unworthy
of
me
i
flattered
myself
that
i
would
remain
calm
under
all
circumstances
and
here
i
am
acting
like
a
child
the
absence
of
any
rolling
or
lurching
movement
at
least
proves
that
we
are
not
yet
at
sea
instead
of
crossing
pamlico
sound
may
we
not
be
going
in
the
opposite
direction
up
the
river
neuse
no
what
would
they
go
further
inland
for
if
thomas
roch
has
been
carried
off
from
healthful
house
his
captors
obviously
mean
to
take
him
out
of
the
united
states
probably
to
a
distant
island
in
the
atlantic
or
to
some
point
on
the
european
continent
it
is
therefore
not
up
the
neuse
that
our
maritime
machine
whatever
it
may
be
is
going
but
across
pamlico
sound
which
must
be
as
calm
as
a
mirror
very
well
then
when
we
get
to
sea
i
shall
soon
know
for
the
vessel
will
rock
right
enough
in
the
swell
off
shore
even
though
there
be
no
wind
unless
i
am
aboard
a
battleship
or
big
cruiser
and
this
i
fancy
can
hardly
be
but
hark
if
i
mistake
not
no
it
was
not
imagination
i
hear
footsteps
some
one
is
approaching
the
side
of
the
compartment
where
the
door
is
one
of
the
crew
no
doubt
are
they
going
to
let
me
out
at
last
i
can
now
hear
voices
a
conversation
is
going
on
outside
the
door
but
it
is
carried
on
in
a
language
that
i
do
not
understand
i
shout
to
them
i
shout
again
but
no
answer
is
vouchsafed
there
is
nothing
to
do
then
but
wait
wait
wait
i
keep
repeating
the
word
and
it
rings
in
my
ears
like
a
bell
let
me
try
to
calculate
how
long
i
have
been
here
the
ship
must
have
been
under
way
for
at
least
four
or
five
hours
i
reckon
it
must
be
past
midnight
but
i
can
not
tell
for
unfortunately
my
watch
is
of
no
use
to
me
in
this
cimmerian
darkness
now
if
we
have
been
going
for
five
hours
we
must
have
cleared
pamlico
sound
whether
we
issued
by
ocracoke
or
hatteras
inlet
and
must
be
off
the
coast
a
good
mile
at
least
yet
i
have
felt
any
motion
from
the
swell
of
the
sea
it
is
inexplicable
incredible
come
now
have
i
made
a
mistake
am
i
the
dupe
of
an
illusion
am
i
not
imprisoned
in
the
hold
of
a
ship
under
way
another
hour
has
passed
and
the
movement
of
the
ship
suddenly
ceases
i
realize
perfectly
that
she
is
stationary
has
she
reached
her
destination
in
this
event
we
can
only
be
in
one
of
the
coast
ports
to
the
north
or
south
of
pamlico
sound
but
why
should
thomas
roch
be
landed
again
the
abduction
must
soon
have
been
discovered
and
our
kidnappers
would
run
the
greatest
risk
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
authorities
if
they
attempted
to
disembark
however
this
may
be
if
the
vessel
is
coming
to
anchor
i
shall
hear
the
noise
of
the
chain
as
it
is
paid
out
and
feel
the
jerk
as
the
ship
is
brought
up
i
know
that
sound
and
that
jerk
well
from
experience
and
i
am
bound
to
hear
and
feel
them
in
a
minute
or
two
i
wait
i
listen
a
dead
and
disquieting
silence
reigns
on
board
i
begin
to
wonder
whether
i
am
not
the
only
living
being
in
the
ship
now
i
feel
an
irresistible
torpor
coming
over
me
the
air
is
vitiated
i
can
not
breathe
my
chest
is
bursting
i
try
to
resist
but
it
is
impossible
to
do
so
the
temperature
rises
to
such
a
degree
that
i
am
compelled
to
divest
myself
of
part
of
my
clothing
then
i
lie
me
down
in
a
corner
my
heavy
eyelids
close
and
i
sink
into
a
prostration
that
eventually
forces
me
into
heavy
slumber
how
long
have
i
been
asleep
i
can
not
say
is
it
night
is
it
day
i
know
not
i
remark
however
that
i
breathe
more
easily
and
that
the
air
is
no
longer
poisoned
carbonic
acid
was
the
air
renewed
while
i
slept
has
the
door
been
opened
has
anybody
been
in
here
yes
here
is
the
proof
of
it
in
feeling
about
my
hand
has
come
in
contact
with
a
mug
filled
with
a
liquid
that
exhales
an
inviting
odor
i
raise
it
to
my
lips
which
are
burning
for
i
am
suffering
such
an
agony
of
thirst
that
i
would
even
drink
brackish
water
it
is
ale
an
ale
of
excellent
quality
which
refreshes
and
comforts
me
and
i
drain
the
pint
to
the
last
drop
but
if
they
have
not
condemned
me
to
die
of
thirst
neither
have
they
condemned
me
to
die
of
hunger
i
suppose
no
for
in
one
of
the
corners
i
find
a
basket
and
this
basket
contains
some
bread
and
cold
meat
i
fall
to
eating
greedily
and
my
strength
little
by
little
returns
decidedly
i
am
not
so
abandoned
as
i
thought
i
was
some
one
entered
this
obscure
hole
and
the
open
door
admitted
a
little
of
the
oxygen
from
the
outside
without
which
i
should
have
been
suffocated
then
the
wherewithal
to
quench
my
thirst
and
appease
the
pangs
of
hunger
was
placed
within
my
reach
how
much
longer
will
this
incarceration
last
days
months
i
can
not
estimate
the
hours
that
have
elapsed
since
i
fell
asleep
nor
have
i
any
idea
as
to
what
time
of
the
day
or
night
it
may
be
i
was
careful
to
wind
up
my
watch
though
and
perhaps
by
feeling
the
hands
yes
i
think
the
little
hand
marks
eight
in
the
morning
no
doubt
what
i
do
know
however
is
that
the
ship
is
not
in
motion
there
is
not
the
slightest
quiver
hours
and
hours
weary
interminable
hours
go
by
and
i
wonder
whether
they
are
again
waiting
till
night
comes
on
to
renew
my
stock
of
air
and
provisions
yes
they
are
waiting
to
take
advantage
of
my
slumbers
but
this
time
i
am
resolved
to
resist
i
will
feign
to
be
asleep
and
i
shall
know
how
to
force
an
answer
from
whoever
enters
chapter
vi
on
deck
here
i
am
in
the
open
air
breathing
freely
once
more
i
have
at
last
been
hauled
out
of
that
stifling
box
and
taken
on
deck
i
gaze
around
me
in
every
direction
and
see
no
sign
of
land
on
every
hand
is
that
circular
line
which
defines
earth
and
sky
no
there
is
not
even
a
speck
of
land
to
be
seen
to
the
west
where
the
coast
of
north
america
extends
for
thousands
of
miles
the
setting
sun
now
throws
but
slanting
rays
upon
the
bosom
of
the
ocean
it
must
be
about
six
in
the
evening
i
take
out
my
watch
and
it
marks
thirteen
minutes
past
six
as
i
have
already
mentioned
i
waited
for
the
door
of
my
prison
to
open
thoroughly
resolved
not
to
fall
asleep
again
but
to
spring
upon
the
first
person
who
entered
and
force
him
to
answer
my
questions
i
was
not
aware
then
that
it
was
day
but
it
was
and
hour
after
hour
passed
and
no
one
came
i
began
to
suffer
again
from
hunger
and
thirst
for
i
had
not
preserved
either
bite
or
sup
as
soon
as
i
awoke
i
felt
that
the
ship
was
in
motion
again
after
having
i
calculated
remained
stationary
since
the
previous
day
no
doubt
in
some
lonely
creek
since
i
had
not
heard
or
felt
her
come
to
anchor
a
few
minutes
ago
it
must
therefore
have
been
six
i
again
heard
footsteps
on
the
other
side
of
the
iron
wall
of
my
compartment
was
anybody
coming
to
my
cell
yes
for
i
heard
the
creaking
of
the
bolts
as
they
were
drawn
back
and
then
the
door
opened
and
the
darkness
in
which
i
had
been
plunged
since
the
first
hour
of
my
captivity
was
illumined
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
two
men
whom
i
had
no
time
to
look
at
entered
and
seized
me
by
the
arms
a
thick
cloth
was
thrown
over
my
head
which
was
enveloped
in
such
a
manner
that
i
could
see
absolutely
nothing
what
did
it
all
mean
what
were
they
going
to
do
with
me
i
struggled
but
they
held
me
in
an
iron
grasp
i
questioned
them
but
they
made
no
reply
the
men
spoke
to
each
other
in
a
language
that
i
could
not
understand
and
had
never
heard
before
they
stood
upon
no
ceremony
with
me
it
is
true
i
was
only
a
madhouse
warder
and
they
probably
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
do
so
but
i
question
very
much
whether
simon
hart
the
engineer
would
have
received
any
more
courtesy
at
their
hands
this
time
however
no
attempt
was
made
to
gag
me
nor
to
bind
either
my
arms
or
legs
i
was
simply
restrained
by
main
force
from
breaking
away
from
them
in
a
moment
i
was
dragged
out
of
the
compartment
and
pushed
along
a
narrow
passage
next
the
steps
of
a
metallic
stairway
resounded
under
our
feet
then
the
fresh
air
blew
in
my
face
and
i
inhaled
it
with
avidity
finally
they
took
their
hands
from
off
me
and
i
found
myself
free
i
immediately
tore
the
cloth
off
my
head
and
gazed
about
me
i
am
on
board
a
schooner
which
is
ripping
through
the
water
at
a
great
rate
and
leaving
a
long
white
trail
behind
her
i
had
to
clutch
at
one
of
the
stays
for
support
dazzled
as
i
was
by
the
light
after
my
hours
imprisonment
in
complete
obscurity
on
the
deck
a
dozen
men
with
rough
faces
come
and
go
very
dissimilar
types
of
men
to
whom
it
would
be
impossible
to
attribute
any
particular
nationality
they
scarcely
take
any
notice
of
me
as
to
the
schooner
i
estimate
that
she
registers
from
two
hundred
and
fifty
to
three
hundred
tons
she
has
a
fairly
wide
beam
her
masts
are
strong
and
lofty
and
her
large
spread
of
canvas
must
carry
her
along
at
a
spanking
rate
in
a
good
breeze
aft
a
man
is
at
the
wheel
and
he
is
keeping
her
head
to
the
sea
that
is
running
pretty
high
i
try
to
find
out
the
name
of
the
vessel
but
it
is
not
to
be
seen
anywhere
even
on
the
i
walk
up
to
one
of
the
sailors
and
inquire
what
is
the
name
of
this
ship
no
answer
and
i
fancy
the
man
does
not
understand
me
where
is
the
captain
i
continue
but
the
sailor
pays
no
more
heed
to
this
than
he
did
to
the
previous
question
i
turn
on
my
heel
and
go
forward
above
the
forward
hatchway
a
bell
is
suspended
maybe
the
name
of
the
schooner
is
engraved
upon
it
i
examine
it
but
can
find
no
name
upon
it
i
then
return
to
the
stern
and
address
the
man
at
the
wheel
he
gazes
at
me
sourly
shrugs
his
shoulders
and
bending
grasps
the
spokes
of
the
wheel
solidly
and
brings
the
schooner
which
had
been
headed
off
by
a
large
wave
from
port
stem
on
to
sea
again
seeing
that
nothing
is
to
be
got
from
that
quarter
i
turn
away
and
look
about
to
see
if
i
can
find
thomas
roch
but
i
do
not
perceive
him
anywhere
is
he
not
on
board
he
must
be
they
could
have
had
no
reason
for
carrying
me
off
alone
no
one
could
have
had
any
idea
that
i
was
simon
hart
the
engineer
and
even
had
they
known
it
what
interest
could
they
have
had
in
me
and
what
could
they
expect
of
me
therefore
as
roch
is
not
on
deck
i
conclude
that
he
is
locked
in
one
of
the
cabins
and
trust
he
has
met
with
better
treatment
than
his
but
what
is
this
and
how
on
earth
could
i
have
failed
to
notice
it
before
how
is
this
schooner
moving
her
sails
are
furled
there
is
not
an
inch
of
canvas
set
the
wind
has
fallen
and
the
few
puffs
that
occasionally
come
from
the
east
are
unfavorable
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
are
going
in
that
very
direction
and
yet
the
schooner
speeds
through
the
sea
her
bows
down
throwing
off
clouds
of
foam
and
leaving
a
long
milky
undulating
trail
in
her
wake
is
she
a
no
there
is
not
a
smokestack
about
her
is
she
propelled
by
electricity
by
a
battery
of
accumulators
or
by
piles
of
great
power
that
work
her
screw
and
send
her
along
at
this
rate
i
can
come
to
no
other
conclusion
in
any
case
she
must
be
fitted
with
a
screw
and
by
leaning
over
the
stern
i
shall
be
able
to
see
it
and
can
find
out
what
sets
it
working
afterwards
the
man
at
the
wheel
watches
me
ironically
as
i
approach
but
makes
no
effort
to
prevent
me
from
looking
over
i
gaze
long
and
earnestly
but
there
is
no
foaming
and
seething
of
the
water
such
as
is
invariably
caused
by
the
revolutions
of
the
screw
naught
but
the
long
white
furrow
that
a
sailing
vessel
leaves
behind
is
discernible
in
the
schooner
wake
then
what
kind
of
a
machine
is
it
that
imparts
such
a
marvellous
speed
to
the
vessel
as
i
have
already
said
the
wind
is
against
her
and
there
is
a
heavy
swell
on
i
must
i
will
know
no
one
pays
the
slightest
attention
and
i
again
go
forward
as
i
approach
the
forecastle
i
find
myself
face
to
face
with
a
man
who
is
leaning
nonchalantly
on
the
raised
hatchway
and
who
is
watching
me
he
seems
to
be
waiting
for
me
to
speak
to
him
i
recognize
him
instantly
he
is
the
person
who
accompanied
the
count
during
the
latter
visit
to
healthful
house
there
can
be
no
mistake
it
is
he
right
enough
it
was
then
that
rich
foreigner
who
abducted
thomas
roch
and
i
am
on
board
the
his
which
is
so
well
known
on
the
american
coast
the
man
before
me
will
enlighten
me
about
what
i
want
to
know
i
remember
that
he
and
the
count
spoke
english
together
i
take
him
to
be
the
captain
of
the
schooner
captain
i
say
you
are
the
person
i
saw
at
healthful
house
you
remember
me
of
course
he
looks
me
up
and
down
but
does
not
condescend
to
reply
i
am
warder
gaydon
the
attendant
of
thomas
roch
i
continue
and
i
want
to
know
why
you
have
carried
me
off
and
placed
me
on
board
this
schooner
the
captain
interrupts
me
with
a
sign
it
is
not
made
to
me
however
but
to
some
sailors
standing
near
they
catch
me
by
the
arms
and
taking
no
notice
of
the
angry
movement
that
i
can
not
restrain
bundle
me
down
the
hatchway
the
hatchway
stair
in
reality
i
remark
is
a
perpendicular
iron
ladder
at
the
bottom
of
which
to
right
and
left
are
some
cabins
and
forward
the
men
quarters
are
they
going
to
put
me
back
in
my
dark
prison
at
the
bottom
of
the
hold
no
they
turn
to
the
left
and
push
me
into
a
cabin
it
is
lighted
by
a
which
is
open
and
through
which
the
fresh
air
comes
in
gusts
from
the
briny
the
furniture
consists
of
a
bunk
a
chair
a
chest
of
drawers
a
and
a
table
the
latter
is
spread
for
dinner
and
i
sit
down
then
the
cook
mate
comes
in
with
two
or
three
dishes
he
is
a
colored
lad
and
as
he
is
about
to
withdraw
i
try
to
question
him
but
he
too
vouchsafes
no
reply
perhaps
he
does
understand
me
the
door
is
closed
and
i
fall
to
and
eat
with
an
excellent
appetite
with
the
intention
of
putting
off
all
further
questioning
till
some
future
occasion
when
i
shall
stand
a
chance
of
getting
answered
it
is
true
i
am
a
prisoner
but
this
time
i
am
comfortable
enough
and
i
hope
i
shall
be
permitted
to
occupy
this
cabin
for
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
and
not
be
lowered
into
that
black
hole
again
i
now
give
myself
up
to
my
thoughts
the
first
of
which
is
that
it
was
the
count
who
planned
the
abduction
that
it
was
he
who
is
responsible
for
the
kidnapping
of
thomas
roch
and
that
consequently
the
french
inventor
must
be
just
as
comfortably
installed
somewhere
on
board
the
schooner
but
who
is
this
count
where
does
he
hail
from
if
he
has
seized
thomas
roch
is
it
not
because
he
is
determined
to
secure
the
secret
of
the
fulgurator
at
no
matter
what
cost
very
likely
and
i
must
therefore
be
careful
not
to
betray
my
identity
for
if
they
knew
the
truth
i
should
never
be
afforded
a
chance
to
get
away
but
what
a
lot
of
mysteries
to
clear
up
how
many
inexplicable
things
to
explain
the
origin
of
this
his
intentions
as
to
the
future
whither
we
are
bound
the
port
to
which
the
schooner
belongs
and
this
mysterious
progress
through
the
water
without
sails
and
without
screws
at
a
speed
of
at
least
ten
knots
an
hour
the
air
becoming
keener
as
night
deepens
i
close
and
secure
the
and
as
my
cabin
is
bolted
on
the
outside
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
get
into
my
bunk
and
let
myself
be
gently
rocked
to
sleep
by
the
broad
atlantic
in
this
mysterious
cradle
the
the
next
morning
i
rise
at
daybreak
and
having
performed
my
ablutions
dress
myself
and
wait
presently
the
idea
of
trying
the
door
occurs
to
me
i
find
that
it
has
been
unbolted
and
pushing
it
open
climb
the
iron
ladder
and
emerge
on
deck
the
crew
are
washing
down
the
deck
and
standing
aft
and
conversing
are
two
men
one
of
whom
is
the
captain
the
latter
manifests
no
surprise
at
seeing
me
and
indicates
my
presence
to
his
companion
by
a
nod
this
other
man
whom
i
have
never
before
seen
is
an
individual
of
about
fifty
years
of
age
whose
dark
hair
is
streaked
with
gray
his
features
are
delicately
chiselled
his
eyes
are
bright
and
his
expression
is
intelligent
and
not
at
all
displeasing
he
is
somewhat
of
the
grecian
type
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
is
of
hellenic
origin
when
i
hear
him
called
serko
engineer
serko
by
the
captain
of
the
as
to
the
latter
he
is
called
spade
captain
spade
and
this
name
has
an
italian
twang
about
it
thus
there
is
a
greek
an
italian
and
a
crew
recruited
from
every
corner
of
the
earth
to
man
a
schooner
with
a
norwegian
name
this
mixture
strikes
me
as
being
suspicious
and
that
count
with
his
spanish
name
and
asiatic
type
where
does
he
come
from
captain
spade
and
engineer
serko
continue
to
converse
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
the
former
is
keeping
a
sharp
eye
on
the
man
at
the
wheel
who
does
not
appear
to
pay
any
particular
attention
to
the
compass
in
front
of
him
he
seems
to
pay
more
heed
to
the
gestures
of
one
of
the
sailors
stationed
forward
and
who
signals
to
him
to
put
the
helm
to
port
or
to
starboard
thomas
roch
is
near
them
gazing
vacantly
out
upon
the
vast
expanse
which
is
not
limited
on
the
horizon
by
a
single
speck
of
land
two
sailors
watch
his
every
movement
it
is
evidently
feared
that
the
madman
may
possibly
attempt
to
jump
overboard
i
wonder
whether
i
shall
be
permitted
to
communicate
with
my
ward
i
walk
towards
him
and
captain
spade
and
engineer
serko
watch
me
thomas
roch
does
see
me
coming
and
i
stand
beside
him
still
he
takes
no
notice
of
me
and
makes
no
movement
his
eyes
which
sparkle
brightly
wander
over
the
ocean
and
he
draws
in
deep
breaths
of
the
salt
vivifying
atmosphere
added
to
the
air
surcharged
with
oxygen
is
a
magnificent
sunset
in
a
cloudless
sky
does
he
perceive
the
change
in
his
situation
has
he
already
forgotten
about
healthful
house
the
pavilion
in
which
he
was
a
prisoner
and
gaydon
his
keeper
it
is
highly
probable
the
past
has
presumably
been
effaced
from
his
memory
and
he
lives
solely
in
the
present
in
my
opinion
even
on
the
deck
of
the
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
thomas
roch
is
still
the
helpless
irresponsible
man
whom
i
tended
for
fifteen
months
his
intellectual
condition
has
undergone
no
change
and
his
reason
will
return
only
when
he
is
spoken
to
about
his
inventions
the
count
is
perfectly
aware
of
this
mental
disposition
having
had
a
proof
of
it
during
his
visit
and
he
evidently
relies
thereon
to
surprise
sooner
or
later
the
secret
but
with
what
object
thomas
roch
i
exclaim
my
voice
seems
to
strike
him
and
after
gazing
at
me
fixedly
for
an
instant
he
averts
his
eyes
quickly
i
take
his
hand
and
press
it
he
withdraws
it
brusquely
and
walks
away
without
having
recognized
me
in
the
direction
of
captain
spade
and
engineer
serko
does
he
think
of
speaking
to
one
or
other
of
these
men
and
if
they
speak
to
him
will
he
be
more
reasonable
than
he
was
with
me
and
reply
to
them
at
this
moment
his
physiognomy
lights
up
with
a
gleam
of
intelligence
his
attention
obviously
has
been
attracted
by
the
queer
progress
of
the
schooner
he
gazes
at
the
masts
and
the
furled
sails
then
he
turns
back
and
stops
at
the
place
where
if
the
were
a
steamer
the
funnel
ought
to
be
and
which
in
this
case
ought
to
be
belching
forth
a
cloud
of
black
smoke
what
appeared
so
strange
to
me
evidently
strikes
thomas
roch
as
being
strange
too
he
can
not
explain
what
i
found
inexplicable
and
as
i
did
he
walks
aft
to
see
if
there
is
a
screw
on
the
flanks
of
the
a
shoal
of
porpoises
are
sporting
swift
as
is
the
schooner
course
they
easily
pass
her
leaping
and
gambolling
in
their
native
element
with
surprising
grace
and
agility
thomas
roch
pays
no
attention
to
them
but
leans
over
the
stern
engineer
serko
and
captain
spade
fearful
lest
he
should
fall
overboard
hurry
to
him
and
drag
him
gently
but
firmly
away
i
observe
from
long
experience
that
roch
is
a
prey
to
violent
excitement
he
turns
about
and
gesticulates
uttering
incoherent
phrases
the
while
it
is
plain
to
me
that
another
fit
is
coming
on
similar
to
the
one
he
had
in
the
pavilion
of
healthful
house
on
the
night
we
were
abducted
he
will
have
to
be
seized
and
carried
down
to
his
cabin
and
i
shall
perhaps
be
summoned
to
attend
to
him
meanwhile
engineer
serko
and
captain
spade
do
not
lose
sight
of
him
for
a
moment
they
are
evidently
curious
to
see
what
he
will
do
after
walking
towards
the
mainmast
and
assuring
himself
that
the
sails
are
not
set
he
goes
up
to
it
and
flinging
his
arms
around
it
tries
with
all
his
might
to
shake
it
as
though
seeking
to
pull
it
down
finding
his
efforts
futile
he
quits
it
and
goes
to
the
foremast
where
the
same
performance
is
gone
through
he
waxes
more
and
more
excited
his
vague
utterances
are
followed
by
inarticulate
cries
suddenly
he
rushes
to
the
port
stays
and
clings
to
them
and
i
begin
to
fear
that
he
will
leap
into
the
rigging
and
climb
to
the
where
he
might
be
precipitated
into
the
sea
by
a
lurch
of
the
ship
on
a
sign
from
captain
spade
some
sailors
run
up
and
try
to
make
him
relinquish
his
grasp
of
the
stays
but
are
unable
to
do
so
i
know
that
during
his
fits
he
is
endowed
with
the
strength
of
ten
men
and
many
a
time
i
have
been
compelled
to
summon
assistance
in
order
to
overpower
him
other
members
of
the
crew
however
come
up
and
the
unhappy
madman
is
borne
to
the
deck
where
two
big
sailors
hold
him
down
despite
his
extraordinary
strength
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
convey
him
to
his
cabin
and
let
him
lie
there
till
he
gets
over
his
fit
this
is
what
will
be
done
in
conformity
with
orders
given
by
a
whose
voice
seems
familiar
to
me
i
turn
and
recognize
him
he
is
the
count
with
a
frown
on
his
face
and
an
imperious
manner
just
as
i
had
seen
him
at
healthful
house
i
at
once
advance
toward
him
i
want
an
explanation
and
mean
to
have
it
by
what
right
sir
i
begin
by
the
right
of
might
replies
the
count
then
he
turns
on
his
heel
and
thomas
roch
is
carried
below
chapter
vii
two
days
at
sea
perhaps
should
circumstances
render
it
necessary
i
may
be
induced
to
tell
the
count
that
i
am
simon
hart
the
engineer
who
knows
but
what
i
may
receive
more
consideration
than
if
i
remain
warder
gaydon
this
measure
however
demands
reflection
i
have
always
been
dominated
by
the
thought
that
if
the
owner
of
the
kidnapped
the
french
inventor
it
was
in
the
hope
of
getting
possession
of
fulgurator
for
which
neither
the
old
nor
new
continent
would
pay
the
impossible
price
demanded
in
that
case
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
remain
warder
gaydon
on
the
chance
that
i
may
be
allowed
to
continue
in
attendance
upon
him
in
this
way
if
thomas
roch
should
ever
divulge
his
secret
i
may
learn
what
it
was
impossible
to
do
at
healthful
house
and
can
act
accordingly
meanwhile
where
is
the
bound
first
question
who
and
what
is
the
count
second
question
the
first
will
be
answered
in
a
few
days
time
no
doubt
in
view
of
the
rapidity
with
which
we
are
ripping
through
the
water
under
the
action
of
a
means
of
propulsion
that
i
shall
end
by
finding
out
all
about
as
regards
the
second
i
am
by
no
means
so
sure
that
my
curiosity
will
ever
be
gratified
in
my
opinion
this
enigmatical
personage
has
an
all
important
reason
for
hiding
his
origin
and
i
am
afraid
there
is
no
indication
by
which
i
can
gauge
his
nationality
if
the
count
speaks
english
fluently
and
i
was
able
to
assure
myself
of
that
fact
during
his
visit
to
pavilion
no
he
pronounces
it
with
a
harsh
vibrating
accent
which
is
not
to
be
found
among
the
peoples
of
northern
latitudes
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
heard
anything
like
it
in
the
course
of
my
travels
either
in
the
old
or
new
world
unless
it
be
the
harshness
characteristic
of
the
idioms
in
use
among
the
malays
and
in
truth
with
his
olive
verging
on
skin
his
crinkly
hair
his
piercing
restless
eyes
his
square
shoulders
and
marked
muscular
development
it
is
by
no
means
unlikely
that
he
belongs
to
one
of
the
extreme
eastern
races
i
believe
this
name
of
is
an
assumed
one
and
his
title
of
count
likewise
if
his
schooner
bears
a
norwegian
name
he
at
any
rate
is
not
of
scandinavian
origin
he
has
nothing
of
the
races
of
northern
europe
about
him
but
whoever
and
whatever
he
may
be
this
man
abducted
thomas
roch
and
me
with
him
with
no
good
intention
i
be
bound
but
what
i
should
like
to
know
is
has
he
acted
as
the
agent
of
a
foreign
power
or
on
his
own
account
does
he
wish
to
profit
alone
by
thomas
roch
invention
and
is
he
in
the
position
to
dispose
of
it
profitably
that
is
another
question
that
i
can
not
yet
answer
maybe
i
shall
be
able
to
find
out
from
what
i
hear
and
see
ere
i
make
my
escape
if
escape
be
possible
the
continues
on
her
way
in
the
same
mysterious
manner
i
am
free
to
walk
about
the
deck
without
however
being
able
to
go
beyond
the
fore
hatchway
once
i
attempted
to
go
as
far
as
the
bows
where
i
could
by
leaning
over
perceive
the
schooner
stem
as
it
cut
through
the
water
but
acting
it
was
plain
on
orders
received
the
watch
on
deck
turned
me
back
and
one
of
them
addressing
me
brusquely
in
harsh
grating
english
said
go
back
go
back
you
are
interfering
with
the
working
of
the
ship
with
the
working
of
the
ship
there
was
no
working
did
they
realize
that
i
was
trying
to
discover
by
what
means
the
schooner
was
propelled
very
likely
and
captain
spade
who
had
looked
on
must
have
known
it
too
even
a
hospital
attendant
could
not
fail
to
be
astonished
at
the
fact
that
a
vessel
without
either
screw
or
sails
was
going
along
at
such
a
speed
however
this
may
be
for
some
reason
or
other
the
bows
of
the
are
barred
to
me
toward
ten
a
breeze
springs
up
a
northwest
wind
and
very
favorable
and
captain
spade
gives
an
order
to
the
boatswain
the
latter
immediately
pipes
all
hands
on
deck
and
the
mainsail
the
foresail
staysail
and
jibs
are
hoisted
the
work
could
not
have
been
executed
with
greater
regularity
and
discipline
on
board
a
the
now
has
a
slight
list
to
port
and
her
speed
is
notably
increased
but
the
motor
continues
to
push
her
along
as
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
the
sails
are
not
always
as
full
as
they
ought
to
be
if
the
schooner
were
bowling
along
solely
under
their
action
however
they
continue
to
render
yeoman
service
for
the
breeze
has
set
in
steadily
the
sky
is
clear
for
the
clouds
in
the
west
disappear
as
soon
as
they
attain
the
horizon
and
the
sunlight
dances
on
the
water
my
preoccupation
now
is
to
find
out
as
near
as
possible
where
we
are
bound
for
i
am
a
sailor
to
be
able
to
estimate
the
approximate
speed
of
a
ship
in
my
opinion
the
has
been
travelling
at
the
rate
of
from
ten
to
eleven
knots
an
hour
as
to
the
direction
we
have
been
going
in
it
is
always
the
same
and
i
have
been
able
to
verify
this
by
casual
glances
at
the
binnacle
if
the
fore
part
of
the
vessel
is
barred
to
warder
gaydon
he
has
been
allowed
a
free
run
of
the
remainder
of
it
time
and
again
i
have
glanced
at
the
compass
and
noticed
that
the
needle
invariably
pointed
to
the
east
or
to
be
exact
these
are
the
conditions
in
which
we
are
navigating
this
part
of
the
atlantic
ocean
which
is
bounded
on
the
west
by
the
coast
of
the
united
states
of
america
i
appeal
to
my
memory
what
are
the
islands
or
groups
of
islands
to
be
found
in
the
direction
we
are
going
ere
the
continent
of
the
old
world
is
reached
north
carolina
which
the
schooner
quitted
hours
ago
is
traversed
by
the
parallel
of
latitude
and
this
parallel
extending
eastward
must
if
i
mistake
not
cut
the
african
coast
at
morocco
but
along
the
line
about
three
thousand
miles
from
america
are
the
azores
is
it
presumable
that
the
is
heading
for
this
archipelago
that
the
port
to
which
she
belongs
is
somewhere
in
these
islands
which
constitute
one
of
portugal
insular
domains
i
can
not
admit
such
an
hypothesis
besides
before
the
azores
on
the
line
of
the
parallel
is
the
bermuda
group
which
belongs
to
england
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
good
deal
less
hypothetical
that
if
the
count
was
entrusted
with
the
abduction
of
thomas
roch
by
a
european
power
at
all
it
was
by
the
united
kingdom
of
great
britain
and
ireland
the
possibility
however
remains
that
he
may
be
acting
solely
in
his
own
interest
three
or
four
times
during
the
day
count
has
come
aft
and
remained
for
some
time
scanning
the
surrounding
horizon
attentively
when
a
sail
or
the
smoke
from
a
steamer
heaves
in
sight
he
examines
the
passing
vessel
for
a
considerable
time
with
a
powerful
telescope
i
may
add
that
he
has
not
once
condescended
to
notice
my
presence
on
deck
now
and
then
captain
spade
joins
him
and
both
exchange
a
few
words
in
a
language
that
i
can
neither
understand
nor
recognize
it
is
with
engineer
serko
however
that
the
owner
of
the
converses
more
readily
than
with
anybody
else
and
the
latter
appears
to
be
very
intimate
with
him
the
engineer
is
a
good
deal
more
free
more
loquacious
and
less
surly
than
his
companions
and
i
wonder
what
position
he
occupies
on
the
schooner
is
he
a
personal
friend
of
the
count
does
he
scour
the
seas
with
him
sharing
the
enviable
life
enjoyed
by
the
rich
yachtsman
he
is
the
only
man
of
the
lot
who
seems
to
manifest
if
not
sympathy
with
at
least
some
interest
in
me
i
have
not
seen
thomas
roch
all
day
he
must
be
shut
in
his
cabin
still
under
the
influence
of
the
fit
that
came
upon
him
last
night
i
feel
certain
that
this
is
so
when
about
three
in
the
afternoon
just
as
he
is
about
to
go
below
the
count
beckons
me
to
approach
i
do
not
know
what
he
wishes
to
say
to
me
this
count
but
i
do
know
what
i
will
say
to
him
do
these
fits
to
which
thomas
roch
is
subject
last
long
he
asks
me
in
english
sometimes
hours
i
reply
what
is
to
be
done
nothing
at
all
let
him
alone
until
he
falls
asleep
after
a
sleep
the
fit
will
be
over
and
thomas
roch
will
be
his
own
helpless
self
again
very
well
warder
gaydon
you
will
continue
to
attend
him
as
you
did
at
healthful
house
if
it
be
necessary
to
attend
to
him
yes
on
board
the
schooner
pending
our
arrival
where
where
we
shall
be
afternoon
replies
the
count
i
say
to
myself
then
we
are
not
bound
for
the
coast
of
africa
nor
even
the
azores
there
only
remains
the
hypothesis
that
we
are
making
for
the
bermudas
count
is
about
to
go
down
the
hatchway
when
i
interrogate
him
in
my
turn
sir
i
exclaim
i
desire
to
know
i
have
the
right
to
know
where
i
am
going
and
here
warder
gaydon
he
interrupted
you
have
no
rights
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
answer
when
you
are
spoken
to
i
protest
protest
then
replies
this
haughty
and
imperious
personage
glancing
at
me
menacingly
then
he
disappears
down
the
hatchway
leaving
me
face
to
face
with
engineer
serko
if
i
were
you
warder
gaydon
i
would
resign
myself
to
the
inevitable
remarks
the
latter
with
a
smile
when
one
is
caught
in
a
trap
one
can
cry
out
i
suppose
what
is
the
use
when
no
one
is
near
to
hear
you
i
shall
be
heard
some
day
sir
some
day
that
a
long
way
off
however
shout
as
much
as
you
please
and
with
this
ironical
advice
engineer
serko
leaves
me
to
my
own
reflections
towards
four
a
big
ship
is
reported
about
six
miles
off
to
the
east
coming
in
our
direction
she
is
moving
rapidly
and
grows
perceptibly
larger
black
clouds
of
smoke
pour
out
of
her
two
funnels
she
is
a
warship
for
a
narrow
pennant
floats
from
her
and
though
she
is
not
flying
any
flag
i
take
her
to
be
an
american
cruiser
i
wonder
whether
the
will
render
her
the
customary
salute
as
she
passes
no
for
the
schooner
suddenly
changes
her
course
with
the
evident
intention
of
avoiding
her
this
proceeding
on
the
part
of
such
a
suspicious
yacht
does
not
astonish
me
greatly
but
what
does
cause
me
extreme
surprise
is
captain
spade
way
of
manoeuvring
he
runs
forward
to
a
signalling
apparatus
in
the
bows
similar
to
that
by
which
orders
are
transmitted
to
the
engine
room
of
a
steamer
as
soon
as
he
presses
one
of
the
buttons
of
this
apparatus
the
veers
off
a
point
to
the
evidently
an
order
of
some
kind
has
been
transmitted
to
the
driver
of
the
machine
of
some
kind
which
causes
this
inexplicable
movement
of
the
schooner
by
the
action
of
a
motor
of
some
kind
the
principle
of
which
i
can
not
guess
at
the
result
of
this
manoeuvre
is
that
the
slants
away
from
the
cruiser
whose
course
does
not
vary
why
should
this
warship
cause
a
to
turn
out
of
its
way
i
have
no
idea
but
the
behaves
in
a
very
different
manner
when
about
six
in
the
evening
a
second
ship
comes
in
sight
on
the
port
bow
this
time
instead
of
seeking
to
avoid
her
captain
spade
signals
an
order
by
means
of
the
apparatus
above
referred
to
and
resumes
his
course
to
the
east
which
will
bring
him
close
to
the
said
ship
an
hour
later
the
two
vessels
are
only
about
four
miles
from
each
other
the
wind
has
dropped
completely
the
strange
ship
which
is
a
merchantman
is
taking
in
her
sails
it
is
useless
to
expect
the
wind
to
spring
up
again
during
the
night
and
she
will
lay
becalmed
till
morning
the
however
propelled
by
her
mysterious
motor
continues
to
approach
her
it
goes
without
saying
that
captain
spade
has
also
begun
to
take
in
sail
and
the
work
under
the
direction
of
the
boatswain
effrondat
is
executed
with
the
same
precision
and
promptness
that
struck
me
before
when
the
twilight
deepens
into
darkness
only
a
mile
and
a
half
separates
the
vessels
captain
spade
then
comes
up
to
me
i
am
standing
on
the
starboard
side
and
unceremoniously
orders
me
to
go
below
i
can
but
obey
i
remark
however
ere
i
go
that
the
boatswain
has
not
lighted
the
whereas
the
lamps
of
the
shine
brightly
green
to
starboard
and
red
to
port
i
entertain
no
doubt
that
the
schooner
intends
to
pass
her
without
being
seen
for
though
she
has
slackened
speed
somewhat
her
direction
has
not
been
in
any
way
modified
i
enter
my
cabin
under
the
impression
of
a
vague
foreboding
my
supper
is
on
the
table
but
uneasy
i
know
not
why
i
hardly
touch
it
and
lie
down
to
wait
for
sleep
that
does
not
come
i
remain
in
this
condition
for
two
hours
the
silence
is
unbroken
save
by
the
water
that
ripples
along
the
vessel
sides
my
mind
is
full
of
the
events
of
the
past
two
days
and
other
thoughts
crowd
thickly
upon
me
afternoon
we
shall
reach
our
destination
i
shall
resume
on
land
my
attendance
upon
thomas
roch
if
it
be
necessary
said
the
count
if
when
i
was
thrown
into
that
black
hole
at
the
bottom
of
the
hold
i
was
able
to
perceive
when
the
schooner
started
off
across
pamlico
sound
i
now
feel
that
she
has
come
to
a
stop
it
must
be
about
ten
why
has
she
stopped
when
captain
spade
ordered
me
below
there
was
no
land
in
sight
in
this
direction
there
is
no
island
until
the
bermuda
group
is
reached
at
least
there
is
none
on
the
map
and
we
shall
have
to
go
another
fifty
or
sixty
miles
before
the
bermudas
can
be
sighted
by
the
lookout
men
not
only
has
the
stopped
but
her
immobility
is
almost
complete
there
is
not
a
breath
of
wind
and
scarcely
any
swell
and
her
slight
regular
rocking
is
hardly
perceptible
then
my
thoughts
turn
to
the
merchantman
which
was
only
a
mile
and
a
half
off
on
our
bow
when
i
came
below
if
the
schooner
continued
her
course
towards
her
she
must
be
almost
alongside
now
we
certainly
can
not
be
lying
more
than
one
or
two
cables
length
from
her
the
which
was
becalmed
at
sundown
could
not
have
gone
west
she
must
be
close
by
and
if
the
night
is
clear
i
shall
be
able
to
see
her
through
the
porthole
it
occurs
to
me
that
perhaps
a
chance
of
escape
presents
itself
why
should
i
not
attempt
it
since
no
hope
of
being
restored
to
liberty
is
held
out
to
me
it
is
true
i
can
not
swim
but
if
i
seize
a
life
buoy
and
jump
overboard
i
may
be
able
to
reach
the
ship
if
i
am
not
observed
by
the
watch
on
deck
i
must
quit
my
cabin
and
go
up
by
the
forward
hatchway
i
listen
i
hear
no
noise
either
in
the
men
quarters
or
on
deck
the
sailors
must
all
be
asleep
at
this
hour
here
goes
i
try
to
open
the
door
and
find
it
is
bolted
on
the
outside
as
i
might
have
expected
i
must
give
up
the
attempt
which
after
all
had
small
chance
of
success
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
go
to
sleep
for
i
am
weary
of
mind
if
not
of
body
i
am
restless
and
racked
by
conflicting
thoughts
and
apprehensions
of
i
know
not
what
oh
if
i
could
but
sink
into
the
blessed
oblivion
of
slumber
i
must
have
managed
to
fall
asleep
for
i
have
just
been
awakened
by
a
noise
an
unusual
noise
such
as
i
have
not
hitherto
heard
on
board
the
schooner
day
begins
to
peer
through
the
glass
of
my
which
is
turned
towards
the
east
i
look
at
my
watch
it
is
four
the
first
thing
i
wonder
is
whether
the
has
resumed
her
voyage
no
i
am
certain
she
has
not
either
by
sail
or
by
her
motor
the
sea
is
as
calm
at
sunrise
as
it
was
at
sunset
if
the
has
been
going
ahead
while
i
slept
she
is
at
any
rate
stationary
now
the
noise
to
which
i
referred
is
caused
by
men
hurrying
to
and
fro
on
deck
by
men
heavily
laden
i
fancy
i
can
also
hear
a
similar
noise
in
the
hold
beneath
my
cabin
floor
the
entrance
to
which
is
situated
abaft
the
foremast
i
also
feel
that
something
is
scraping
against
the
schooner
hull
have
boats
come
alongside
are
the
crew
engaged
in
loading
or
unloading
merchandise
and
yet
we
can
not
possibly
have
reached
our
journey
end
the
count
said
that
we
should
not
reach
our
destination
till
this
afternoon
now
i
repeat
she
was
last
night
fully
fifty
or
sixty
miles
from
the
nearest
land
the
group
of
the
bermudas
that
she
could
have
returned
westward
and
can
be
in
proximity
to
the
american
coast
is
inadmissible
in
view
of
the
distance
moreover
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
has
remained
stationary
all
night
before
i
fell
asleep
i
know
she
had
stopped
and
i
now
know
that
she
is
not
moving
however
i
shall
see
when
i
am
allowed
to
go
on
deck
my
cabin
door
is
still
bolted
i
find
on
trying
it
but
i
do
not
think
they
are
likely
to
keep
me
here
when
broad
daylight
is
on
an
hour
goes
by
and
it
gradually
gets
lighter
i
look
out
of
my
porthole
the
ocean
is
covered
by
a
mist
which
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
will
speedily
disperse
i
can
however
see
for
a
half
a
mile
and
if
the
merchantman
is
not
visible
it
is
probably
because
she
is
lying
off
the
other
or
port
side
of
the
presently
i
hear
a
key
turned
in
my
door
and
the
bolts
drawn
i
push
the
door
open
and
clamber
up
the
iron
ladder
to
the
deck
just
as
the
men
are
battening
down
the
cover
of
the
hold
i
look
for
the
count
but
do
not
see
him
he
has
not
yet
left
his
cabin
aft
captain
spade
and
engineer
serko
are
superintending
the
stowing
of
some
bales
which
have
doubtless
been
hoisted
from
the
hold
this
explains
the
noisy
operations
that
were
going
on
when
i
was
awakened
obviously
if
the
crew
are
getting
out
the
cargo
we
are
approaching
the
end
of
our
voyage
we
are
not
far
from
port
and
perhaps
in
a
few
hours
the
schooner
will
drop
anchor
but
what
about
the
sailing
ship
that
was
to
port
of
us
she
ought
to
be
in
the
same
place
seeing
that
there
has
been
and
is
no
wind
i
look
for
her
but
she
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
there
is
not
a
sail
not
a
speck
on
the
horizon
either
east
west
north
or
south
after
cogitating
upon
the
circumstance
i
can
only
arrive
at
the
following
conclusion
which
however
can
only
be
accepted
under
reserve
although
i
did
not
notice
it
the
resumed
her
voyage
while
i
slept
leaving
the
becalmed
behind
her
and
this
is
why
the
merchantman
is
no
longer
visible
i
am
careful
not
to
question
captain
spade
about
it
nor
even
engineer
serko
as
i
should
certainly
receive
no
answer
besides
at
this
moment
captain
spade
goes
to
the
signalling
apparatus
and
presses
one
of
the
buttons
on
the
upper
disk
almost
immediately
the
gives
a
jerk
then
with
her
sails
still
furled
she
starts
off
eastward
again
two
hours
later
the
count
comes
up
through
the
main
hatchway
and
takes
his
customary
place
aft
serko
and
captain
spade
at
once
approach
and
engage
in
conversation
with
him
all
three
raise
their
telescopes
and
sweep
the
horizon
from
southeast
to
northeast
no
one
will
be
surprised
to
learn
that
i
gaze
intently
in
the
same
direction
but
having
no
telescope
i
can
not
distinguish
anything
the
midday
meal
over
we
all
return
on
deck
all
with
the
exception
of
thomas
roch
who
has
not
quitted
his
cabin
towards
one
land
is
sighted
by
the
lookout
man
on
the
foretop
inasmuch
as
the
is
bowling
along
at
great
speed
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
make
out
the
coast
line
in
effect
two
hours
later
a
vague
semicircular
line
that
curves
outward
is
discernible
about
eight
miles
off
as
the
schooner
approaches
it
becomes
more
distinct
it
is
a
mountain
or
at
all
events
very
high
ground
and
from
its
summit
a
cloud
of
smoke
ascends
what
a
volcano
in
these
parts
it
must
then
be
chapter
viii
back
cup
in
my
opinion
the
could
have
struck
no
other
group
of
islands
but
the
bermudas
in
this
part
of
the
atlantic
this
is
clear
from
the
distance
covered
from
the
american
coast
and
the
direction
sailed
in
since
we
issued
from
pamlico
sound
this
direction
has
constantly
been
and
the
distance
judging
from
the
rate
of
speed
which
has
scarcely
varied
is
approximately
seven
hundred
and
fifty
miles
still
the
schooner
does
not
slacken
speed
the
count
and
engineer
serko
remain
aft
by
the
man
at
the
wheel
captain
spade
has
gone
forward
are
we
not
going
to
leave
this
island
which
appears
to
be
isolated
to
the
west
it
does
not
seem
likely
since
it
is
still
broad
daylight
and
the
hour
at
which
the
was
timed
to
arrive
all
the
sailors
are
drawn
up
on
deck
awaiting
orders
and
boatswain
effrondat
is
making
preparations
to
anchor
ere
a
couple
of
hours
have
passed
i
shall
know
all
about
it
it
will
be
the
first
answer
to
one
of
the
many
questions
that
have
perplexed
me
since
the
schooner
put
to
sea
and
yet
it
is
most
unlikely
that
the
port
to
which
the
belongs
is
situated
on
one
of
the
bermuda
islands
in
the
middle
of
an
english
archipelago
unless
the
count
has
kidnapped
thomas
roch
for
the
british
government
which
i
can
not
believe
i
become
aware
that
this
extraordinary
man
is
gazing
at
me
with
singular
persistence
although
he
can
have
no
suspicion
that
i
am
simon
hart
the
engineer
he
must
be
asking
himself
what
i
think
of
this
adventure
if
warder
gaydon
is
but
a
poor
devil
this
poor
devil
will
manifest
as
much
unconcern
as
to
what
is
in
store
for
him
as
any
gentleman
could
even
though
he
were
the
proprietor
of
this
queer
pleasure
yacht
still
i
am
a
little
uneasy
under
his
gaze
i
dare
say
that
if
the
count
could
guess
how
certain
things
have
suddenly
become
clear
to
me
he
would
not
hesitate
to
have
me
thrown
overboard
prudence
therefore
commands
me
to
be
more
circumspect
than
ever
without
giving
rise
to
any
suspicion
even
in
the
mind
of
engineer
serko
i
have
succeeded
in
raising
a
corner
of
the
mysterious
veil
and
i
begin
to
see
ahead
a
bit
as
the
draws
nearer
the
island
or
rather
islet
towards
which
she
is
speeding
shows
more
sharply
against
the
blue
background
of
the
sky
the
sun
which
has
passed
the
zenith
shines
full
upon
the
western
side
the
islet
is
isolated
or
at
any
rate
i
can
not
see
any
others
of
the
group
to
which
it
belongs
either
to
north
or
south
this
islet
of
curious
contexture
resembles
as
near
as
possible
a
cup
turned
upside
down
from
which
a
fuliginous
vapor
arises
its
summit
the
bottom
of
the
cup
if
you
like
is
about
three
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
its
flanks
which
are
steep
and
regular
are
as
bare
as
the
rocks
at
its
base
there
is
another
peculiarity
about
it
which
must
render
the
islet
easily
recognizable
by
mariners
approaching
it
from
the
west
and
this
is
a
rock
which
forms
a
natural
arch
at
the
base
of
the
mountain
the
handle
of
the
cup
so
to
speak
and
through
which
the
waves
wash
as
freely
as
the
sunshine
passes
seen
this
way
the
islet
fully
justifies
the
name
of
back
cup
given
to
it
well
i
know
and
recognize
this
islet
it
is
situated
at
the
extremity
of
the
archipelago
of
the
bermudas
it
is
the
reversed
cup
that
i
had
occasion
to
visit
a
few
years
ago
no
i
am
not
mistaken
i
then
climbed
over
the
calcareous
and
crooked
rocks
at
its
base
on
the
east
side
yes
it
is
back
cup
sure
enough
had
i
been
less
i
might
have
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
satisfaction
which
with
good
reason
would
have
excited
the
attention
and
suspicion
of
the
count
these
are
the
circumstances
under
which
i
came
to
explore
back
cup
while
on
a
visit
to
bermuda
this
archipelago
which
is
situated
about
seven
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
north
carolina
is
composed
of
several
hundred
islands
or
islets
its
centre
is
crossed
by
the
meridian
and
the
parallel
since
the
englishman
lomer
was
shipwrecked
and
cast
up
there
in
the
bermudas
have
belonged
to
the
united
kingdom
and
in
consequence
the
colonial
population
has
increased
to
ten
thousand
inhabitants
it
was
not
for
its
productions
of
cotton
coffee
indigo
and
arrowroot
that
england
annexed
the
group
seized
it
one
might
say
but
because
it
formed
a
splendid
maritime
station
in
that
part
of
the
ocean
and
in
proximity
to
the
united
states
of
america
possession
was
taken
of
it
without
any
protest
on
the
part
of
other
powers
and
bermuda
is
now
administered
by
a
british
governor
with
the
addition
of
a
council
and
a
general
assembly
the
principal
islands
of
the
archipelago
are
called
david
somerset
hamilton
and
george
the
latter
has
a
free
port
and
the
town
of
the
same
name
is
also
the
capital
of
the
group
the
largest
of
these
isles
is
not
more
than
seventeen
miles
long
and
five
wide
leaving
out
the
ones
there
remains
but
an
agglomeration
of
islets
and
reefs
scattered
over
an
area
of
twelve
square
leagues
although
the
climate
of
bermuda
is
very
healthy
very
salubrious
the
isles
are
nevertheless
frightfully
beaten
by
the
heavy
winter
tempests
of
the
atlantic
and
their
approach
by
navigators
presents
certain
difficulties
what
the
archipelago
especially
lacks
are
rivers
and
rios
however
as
abundant
rains
fall
frequently
this
drawback
is
got
over
by
the
inhabitants
who
treasure
up
the
water
for
household
and
agricultural
purposes
this
has
necessitated
the
construction
of
vast
cisterns
which
the
downfalls
keep
filled
these
works
of
engineering
skill
justly
merit
the
admiration
they
receive
and
do
honor
to
the
genius
of
man
it
was
in
connection
with
the
setting
up
of
these
cisterns
that
i
made
the
trip
as
well
as
out
of
curiosity
to
inspect
the
fine
works
i
obtained
from
the
company
of
which
i
was
the
engineer
in
new
jersey
a
vacation
of
several
weeks
and
embarked
at
new
york
for
the
bermudas
while
i
was
staying
on
hamilton
island
in
the
vast
port
of
southampton
an
event
occurred
of
great
interest
to
geologists
one
day
a
whole
flotilla
of
fishers
men
women
and
children
entered
southampton
harbor
for
fifty
years
these
families
had
lived
on
the
east
coast
of
back
cup
where
they
had
erected
and
houses
of
stone
their
position
for
carrying
on
their
industry
was
an
exceptionally
favorable
one
for
the
waters
teem
with
fish
all
the
year
round
and
in
march
and
april
whales
abound
nothing
had
hitherto
occurred
to
disturb
their
tranquil
existence
they
were
quite
contented
with
their
rough
lot
which
was
rendered
less
onerous
by
the
facility
of
communication
with
hamilton
and
george
their
solid
barks
took
cargoes
of
fish
there
which
they
exchanged
for
the
necessities
of
life
why
had
they
thus
abandoned
the
islet
with
the
intention
as
it
pretty
soon
appeared
of
never
returning
to
it
the
reason
turned
out
to
be
that
they
no
longer
considered
themselves
in
safety
there
a
couple
of
months
previously
they
had
been
at
first
surprised
then
alarmed
by
several
distinct
detonations
that
appeared
to
have
taken
place
in
the
interior
of
the
mountain
at
the
same
time
smoke
and
flames
issued
from
the
summit
or
the
bottom
of
the
reversed
cup
if
you
like
now
no
one
had
ever
suspected
that
the
islet
was
of
volcanic
origin
or
that
there
was
a
crater
at
the
top
no
one
having
been
able
to
climb
its
sides
now
however
there
could
be
no
possible
doubt
that
the
mountain
was
an
ancient
volcano
that
had
suddenly
become
active
again
and
threatened
the
village
with
destruction
during
the
ensuing
two
months
internal
rumblings
and
explosions
continued
to
be
heard
which
were
accompanied
by
bursts
of
flame
from
the
top
especially
at
night
the
island
was
shaken
by
the
explosions
the
shocks
could
be
distinctly
felt
all
these
phenomena
were
indicative
of
an
imminent
eruption
and
there
was
no
spot
at
the
base
of
the
mountain
that
could
afford
any
protection
from
the
rivers
of
lava
that
would
inevitably
pour
down
its
smooth
steep
slopes
and
overwhelm
the
village
in
their
boiling
flood
besides
the
very
mountain
might
be
destroyed
in
the
eruption
there
was
nothing
for
the
population
exposed
to
such
a
dire
catastrophe
to
do
but
leave
this
they
did
their
humble
lares
and
penates
in
fact
all
their
belongings
were
loaded
into
the
and
the
entire
colony
sought
refuge
in
southhampton
harbor
the
news
that
a
volcano
that
had
presumably
been
smouldering
for
centuries
at
the
western
extremity
of
the
group
showed
signs
of
breaking
out
again
caused
a
sensation
throughout
the
bermudas
but
while
some
were
terrified
the
curiosity
of
others
was
aroused
mine
included
the
phenomenon
was
worth
investigation
even
if
the
simple
had
exaggerated
back
cup
which
as
already
stated
lies
at
the
western
extremity
of
the
archipelago
is
connected
therewith
by
a
chain
of
small
islets
and
reefs
which
can
not
be
approached
from
the
east
being
only
three
hundred
feet
in
altitude
it
can
not
be
seen
either
from
george
or
hamilton
i
joined
a
party
of
explorers
and
we
embarked
in
a
cutter
that
landed
us
on
the
island
and
made
our
way
to
the
abandoned
village
of
the
bermudan
fishers
the
internal
crackings
and
detonations
could
be
plainly
heard
and
a
sheaf
of
smoke
was
swayed
by
the
wind
at
the
summit
beyond
a
peradventure
the
ancient
volcano
had
been
started
again
by
the
subterranean
fire
and
an
eruption
at
any
moment
was
to
be
apprehended
in
vain
we
attempted
to
climb
to
the
mouth
of
the
crater
the
mountain
sheered
down
at
an
angle
of
from
to
eighty
degrees
and
its
smooth
slippery
sides
afforded
absolutely
no
foothold
anything
more
barren
than
this
rocky
freak
of
nature
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
only
a
few
tufts
of
wild
herbs
were
to
be
seen
upon
the
whole
island
and
these
seemed
to
have
no
our
explorations
were
therefore
necessarily
limited
and
in
view
of
the
active
symptoms
of
danger
that
manifested
themselves
we
could
but
approve
the
action
of
the
villagers
in
abandoning
the
place
for
we
entertained
no
doubt
that
its
destruction
was
imminent
these
were
the
circumstances
in
which
i
was
led
to
visit
back
cup
and
no
one
will
consequently
be
surprised
at
the
fact
that
i
recognized
it
immediately
we
hove
in
sight
of
the
queer
structure
no
i
repeat
the
count
would
probably
not
be
overpleased
if
he
were
aware
that
warder
gaydon
is
perfectly
acquainted
with
this
islet
even
if
the
was
to
anchor
there
which
as
there
is
no
port
is
to
say
the
least
extremely
improbable
as
we
draw
nearer
i
attentively
examine
back
cup
not
one
of
its
former
inhabitants
has
been
induced
to
return
and
as
it
is
absolutely
deserted
i
can
not
imagine
why
the
schooner
should
visit
the
place
perhaps
however
the
count
and
his
companions
have
no
intention
of
landing
there
even
though
the
should
find
temporary
shelter
between
the
rocky
sides
of
a
narrow
creek
there
is
nothing
to
give
ground
to
the
supposition
that
a
wealthy
yachtsman
would
have
the
remotest
idea
of
fixing
upon
as
his
residence
an
arid
cone
exposed
to
all
the
terrible
tempests
of
the
western
atlantic
to
live
here
is
all
very
well
for
rustic
fishermen
but
not
for
the
count
engineer
serko
captain
spade
and
his
crew
back
cup
is
now
only
half
a
mile
off
and
the
seaweed
thrown
up
on
its
rocky
base
is
plainly
discernible
the
only
living
things
upon
it
are
the
and
other
birds
that
circle
in
clouds
around
the
smoking
crater
when
she
is
only
two
cable
lengths
off
the
schooner
slackens
speed
and
then
stops
at
the
entrance
of
a
sort
of
natural
canal
formed
by
a
couple
of
reefs
that
barely
rise
above
the
water
i
wonder
whether
the
will
venture
to
try
the
dangerous
feat
of
passing
through
it
i
do
not
think
so
she
will
probably
lay
where
she
is
though
why
she
should
do
so
i
do
not
know
for
a
few
hours
and
then
continue
her
voyage
towards
the
east
however
this
may
be
i
see
no
preparations
in
progress
for
dropping
anchor
the
anchors
are
suspended
in
their
usual
places
the
cables
have
not
been
cleared
and
no
motion
has
been
made
to
lower
a
single
boat
at
this
moment
count
engineer
serko
and
captain
spade
go
forward
and
perform
some
manoeuvre
that
is
inexplicable
to
me
i
walk
along
the
port
side
of
the
deck
until
i
am
near
the
foremast
and
then
i
can
see
a
small
buoy
that
the
sailors
are
hoisting
in
almost
immediately
the
water
at
the
same
spot
becomes
dark
and
i
observe
a
black
mass
rising
to
the
surface
is
it
a
big
whale
rising
for
air
and
is
the
in
danger
of
being
shattered
by
a
blow
from
the
monster
tail
now
i
understand
at
last
the
mystery
is
solved
i
know
what
was
the
motor
that
caused
the
schooner
to
go
at
such
an
extraordinary
speed
without
sails
and
without
a
screw
her
indefatigable
motor
is
emerging
from
the
sea
after
having
towed
her
from
the
coast
of
america
to
the
archipelago
of
the
bermudas
there
it
is
floating
alongside
a
submersible
boat
a
submarine
tug
worked
by
a
screw
set
in
motion
by
the
current
from
a
battery
of
accumulators
or
powerful
electric
piles
on
the
upper
part
of
the
long
iron
tug
is
a
platform
in
the
middle
of
which
is
the
lid
by
which
an
entrance
is
effected
in
the
fore
part
of
the
platform
projects
a
periscope
or
lookout
formed
by
or
lenses
through
which
an
electric
searchlight
can
throw
its
gleam
for
some
distance
under
water
in
front
of
and
on
each
side
of
the
tug
now
relieved
of
its
ballast
of
water
the
boat
has
risen
to
the
surface
its
lid
will
open
and
fresh
air
will
penetrate
it
to
every
part
in
all
probability
if
it
remained
submerged
during
the
day
it
rose
at
night
and
towed
the
on
the
surface
but
if
the
mechanical
power
of
the
tug
is
produced
by
electricity
the
latter
must
be
furnished
by
some
manufactory
where
it
is
stored
and
the
means
of
procuring
the
batteries
is
not
to
be
found
on
back
cup
i
suppose
and
then
why
does
the
have
recourse
to
this
submarine
towing
system
why
is
she
not
provided
with
her
own
means
of
propulsion
like
other
these
are
things
however
upon
which
i
have
at
present
no
leisure
to
ruminate
the
lid
of
the
tug
opens
and
several
men
issue
on
to
the
platform
they
are
the
crew
of
this
submarine
boat
and
captain
spade
has
been
able
to
communicate
with
them
and
transmit
his
orders
as
to
the
direction
to
be
taken
by
means
of
electric
signals
connected
with
the
tug
by
a
wire
that
passes
along
the
stem
of
the
schooner
engineer
serko
approaches
me
and
says
pointing
to
the
boat
get
in
get
in
i
exclaim
yes
in
the
tug
and
look
sharp
about
it
as
usual
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
obey
i
hasten
to
comply
with
the
order
and
clamber
over
the
side
at
the
same
time
thomas
roch
appears
on
deck
accompanied
by
one
of
the
crew
he
appears
to
be
very
calm
and
very
indifferent
too
and
makes
no
resistance
when
he
is
lifted
over
and
lowered
into
the
tug
when
he
has
been
taken
in
count
and
engineer
serko
follow
captain
spade
and
the
crew
of
the
remain
behind
with
the
exception
of
four
men
who
man
the
dinghy
which
has
been
lowered
they
have
hold
of
a
long
hawser
with
which
the
schooner
is
probably
to
be
towed
through
the
reef
is
there
then
a
creek
in
the
middle
of
the
rocks
where
the
vessel
is
secure
from
the
breakers
is
this
the
port
to
which
she
belongs
they
row
off
with
the
hawser
and
make
the
end
fast
to
a
ring
in
the
reef
then
the
crew
on
board
haul
on
it
and
in
five
minutes
the
schooner
is
so
completely
lost
to
sight
among
the
rocks
that
even
the
tip
of
her
mast
could
not
be
seen
from
the
sea
who
in
bermuda
imagines
that
a
vessel
is
accustomed
to
lay
up
in
this
secret
creek
who
in
america
would
have
any
idea
that
the
rich
yachtsman
so
well
known
in
all
the
eastern
ports
abides
in
the
solitude
of
back
cup
mountain
twenty
minutes
later
the
dinghy
returns
with
the
four
men
towards
the
tug
which
was
evidently
waiting
for
them
before
proceeding
where
they
climb
on
board
the
little
boat
is
made
fast
astern
a
movement
is
felt
the
screw
revolves
rapidly
and
the
tug
skims
along
the
surface
to
back
cup
skirting
the
reefs
to
the
south
three
cable
lengths
further
on
another
tortuous
canal
is
seen
that
leads
to
the
island
into
this
the
tug
enters
when
it
gets
close
inshore
an
order
is
given
to
two
men
who
jump
out
and
haul
the
dinghy
up
on
a
narrow
sandy
beach
out
of
the
reach
of
wave
or
weed
and
where
it
will
be
easily
when
wanted
this
done
the
sailors
return
to
the
tug
and
engineer
serko
signs
to
me
to
go
below
a
short
iron
ladder
leads
into
a
central
cabin
where
various
bales
and
packages
are
stored
and
for
which
no
doubt
there
was
not
room
in
the
hold
of
the
schooner
i
am
pushed
into
a
side
cabin
the
door
is
shut
upon
me
and
here
i
am
once
more
a
prisoner
in
profound
darkness
i
recognize
the
cabin
the
moment
i
enter
it
it
is
the
place
in
which
i
spent
so
many
long
hours
after
our
abduction
from
healthful
house
and
in
which
i
was
confined
until
well
out
at
sea
off
pamlico
sound
it
is
evident
that
thomas
roch
has
been
placed
in
a
similar
compartment
a
loud
noise
is
heard
the
banging
of
the
lid
as
it
closes
and
the
tug
begins
to
sink
as
the
water
is
admitted
to
the
tanks
this
movement
is
succeeded
by
another
a
movement
that
impels
the
boat
through
the
water
three
minutes
later
it
stops
and
i
feel
that
we
are
rising
to
the
surface
again
another
noise
made
by
the
lid
being
raised
the
door
of
my
cabin
opens
and
i
rush
out
and
clamber
on
to
the
platform
i
look
around
and
find
that
the
tug
has
penetrated
to
the
interior
of
back
cup
mountain
this
is
the
mysterious
retreat
where
count
lives
with
his
companions
out
of
the
world
so
to
speak
chapter
ix
inside
back
cup
the
next
morning
i
am
able
to
make
a
first
inspection
of
the
vast
cavern
of
back
cup
no
one
seeks
to
prevent
me
what
a
night
i
have
passed
what
strange
visions
i
have
seen
with
what
impatience
i
waited
for
morning
i
was
conducted
to
a
grotto
about
a
hundred
paces
from
the
edge
of
the
lake
where
the
tug
stopped
the
grotto
twelve
feet
by
ten
was
lighted
by
an
incandescent
lamp
and
fitted
with
an
entrance
door
that
was
closed
upon
me
i
am
not
surprised
that
electricity
is
employed
in
lighting
the
interior
of
the
cavern
as
it
is
also
used
in
the
submarine
boat
but
where
is
it
generated
where
does
it
come
from
is
there
a
manufactory
installed
somewhere
or
other
in
this
vast
crypt
with
machinery
dynamos
and
accumulators
my
cell
is
neatly
furnished
with
a
table
on
which
provisions
are
spread
a
bunk
with
bedding
a
basket
chair
a
with
toilet
set
and
a
closet
containing
linen
and
various
suits
of
clothes
in
a
drawer
of
the
table
i
find
paper
ink
and
pens
my
dinner
consists
of
fresh
fish
preserved
meat
bread
of
excellent
quality
ale
and
whisky
but
i
am
so
excited
that
i
scarcely
touch
it
yet
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
fortify
myself
and
recover
my
calmness
of
mind
i
must
and
will
solve
the
mystery
surrounding
the
handful
of
men
who
burrow
in
the
bowels
of
this
island
so
it
is
under
the
carapace
of
back
cup
that
count
has
established
himself
this
cavity
the
existence
of
which
is
not
even
suspected
is
his
home
when
he
is
not
sailing
in
the
along
the
coasts
of
the
new
world
or
the
old
this
is
the
unknown
retreat
he
has
discovered
to
which
access
is
obtained
by
a
submarine
passage
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
ocean
why
has
he
severed
himself
from
the
world
what
has
been
his
past
if
as
i
suspect
this
name
of
and
this
title
of
count
are
assumed
what
motive
has
he
for
hiding
his
identity
has
he
been
banished
is
he
an
outcast
of
society
that
he
should
have
selected
this
place
above
all
others
am
i
not
in
the
power
of
an
evildoer
anxious
to
ensure
impunity
for
his
crimes
and
to
defy
the
law
by
seeking
refuge
in
this
undiscoverable
burrow
i
have
the
right
of
supposing
anything
in
the
case
of
this
suspicious
foreigner
and
i
exercise
it
then
the
question
to
which
i
have
never
been
able
to
suggest
a
satisfactory
answer
once
more
surges
into
my
mind
why
was
thomas
roch
abducted
from
healthful
house
in
the
manner
already
fully
described
does
the
count
hope
to
force
from
him
the
secret
of
his
fulgurator
with
a
view
to
utilizing
it
for
the
defence
of
back
cup
in
case
his
retreat
should
by
chance
be
discovered
hardly
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
starve
the
gang
out
of
back
cup
by
preventing
the
tug
from
supplying
them
with
provisions
on
the
other
hand
the
schooner
could
never
break
through
the
investing
lines
and
if
she
did
her
description
would
be
known
in
every
port
in
this
event
of
what
possible
use
would
thomas
roch
invention
be
to
the
count
decidedly
i
can
not
understand
it
about
seven
in
the
morning
i
jump
out
of
bed
if
i
am
a
prisoner
in
the
cavern
i
am
at
least
not
imprisoned
in
my
grotto
cell
the
door
yields
when
i
turn
the
handle
and
push
against
it
and
i
walk
out
thirty
yards
in
front
of
me
is
a
rocky
plane
forming
a
sort
of
quay
that
extends
to
right
and
left
several
sailors
of
the
are
engaged
in
landing
bales
and
stores
from
the
interior
of
the
tug
which
lays
alongside
a
little
stone
jetty
a
dim
light
to
which
my
eyes
soon
grow
accustomed
envelops
the
cavern
and
comes
from
a
hole
in
the
centre
of
the
roof
through
which
the
blue
sky
can
be
seen
it
is
from
that
hole
that
the
smoke
which
can
be
seen
for
such
a
distance
issues
i
say
to
myself
and
this
discovery
suggests
a
whole
series
of
reflections
back
cup
then
is
not
a
volcano
as
was
supposed
as
i
supposed
myself
the
flames
that
were
seen
a
few
years
ago
and
the
columns
of
smoke
that
still
rise
were
and
are
produced
artificially
the
detonations
and
rumblings
that
so
alarmed
the
bermudan
fishers
were
not
caused
by
the
internal
workings
of
nature
these
various
phenomena
were
fictitious
they
manifested
themselves
at
the
mere
will
of
the
owner
of
the
island
who
wanted
to
scare
away
the
inhabitants
who
resided
on
the
coast
he
succeeded
this
count
and
remains
the
sole
and
undisputed
monarch
of
the
mountain
by
exploding
gunpowder
and
burning
seaweed
swept
up
in
inexhaustible
quantities
by
the
ocean
he
has
been
able
to
simulate
a
volcano
upon
the
point
of
eruption
and
effectually
scare
settlers
away
the
light
becomes
stronger
as
the
sun
rises
higher
the
daylight
streams
through
the
fictitious
crater
and
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
estimate
the
cavern
dimensions
this
is
how
i
calculate
exteriorly
the
island
of
back
cup
which
is
as
nearly
as
possible
circular
measures
two
hundred
and
fifty
yards
in
circumference
and
presents
an
interior
superficies
of
about
six
acres
the
sides
of
the
mountain
at
its
base
vary
in
thickness
from
thirty
to
a
hundred
yards
it
therefore
follows
that
this
excavation
practically
occupies
the
whole
of
that
part
of
back
cup
island
which
appears
above
water
as
to
the
length
of
the
submarine
tunnel
by
which
communication
is
obtained
with
the
outside
and
through
which
the
tug
passed
i
estimate
that
it
is
fifty
yards
in
length
the
size
of
the
cavern
can
be
judged
from
these
approximate
figures
but
vast
as
it
is
i
remember
that
there
are
caverns
of
larger
dimensions
both
in
the
old
and
new
worlds
for
instance
in
carniole
northumberland
derbyshire
piedmont
the
balearics
hungary
and
california
are
larger
grottoes
than
back
cup
and
those
at
in
belgium
and
the
mammoth
caves
in
kentucky
are
also
more
extensive
the
latter
contain
no
fewer
than
two
hundred
and
domes
seven
rivers
eight
cataracts
thirty
two
wells
of
unknown
depth
and
an
immense
lake
which
extends
over
six
or
seven
leagues
the
limit
of
which
has
never
been
reached
by
explorers
i
know
these
kentucky
grottoes
having
visited
them
as
many
thousands
of
tourists
have
done
the
principal
one
will
serve
as
a
comparison
to
back
cup
the
roof
of
the
former
like
that
of
the
latter
is
supported
by
pillars
of
various
lengths
which
give
it
the
appearance
of
a
gothic
cathedral
with
naves
and
aisles
though
it
lacks
the
architectural
regularity
of
a
religious
edifice
the
only
difference
is
that
whereas
the
roof
of
the
kentucky
grotto
is
over
four
hundred
feet
high
that
of
back
cup
is
not
above
two
hundred
and
twenty
at
that
part
of
it
where
the
round
hole
through
which
issue
the
smoke
and
flames
is
situated
another
peculiarity
and
a
very
important
one
that
requires
to
be
pointed
out
is
that
whereas
the
majority
of
the
grottoes
referred
to
are
easily
accessible
and
were
therefore
bound
to
be
discovered
some
time
or
other
the
same
remark
does
not
apply
to
back
cup
although
it
is
marked
on
the
map
as
an
island
forming
part
of
the
bermuda
group
how
could
any
one
imagine
that
it
is
hollow
that
its
rocky
sides
are
only
the
walls
of
an
enormous
cavern
in
order
to
make
such
a
discovery
it
would
be
necessary
to
get
inside
and
to
get
inside
a
submarine
apparatus
similar
to
that
of
the
count
would
be
necessary
in
my
opinion
this
strange
yachtsman
discovery
of
the
tunnel
by
which
he
has
been
able
to
found
this
disquieting
colony
of
back
cup
must
have
been
due
to
pure
chance
now
i
turn
my
attention
to
the
lake
and
observe
that
it
is
a
very
small
one
measuring
not
more
than
four
hundred
yards
in
circumference
it
is
properly
speaking
a
lagoon
the
rocky
sides
of
which
are
perpendicular
it
is
large
enough
for
the
tug
to
work
about
in
it
and
holds
enough
water
too
for
it
must
be
one
hundred
and
feet
deep
it
goes
without
saying
that
this
crypt
given
its
position
and
structure
belongs
to
the
category
of
those
which
are
due
to
the
encroachments
of
the
sea
it
is
at
once
of
neptunian
and
plutonian
origin
like
the
grottoes
of
crozon
and
morgate
in
the
bay
of
douarnenez
in
france
of
bonifacio
on
the
corsican
coast
thorgatten
in
norway
the
height
of
which
is
estimated
at
over
three
hundred
feet
the
catavaults
of
greece
the
grottoes
of
gibraltar
in
spain
and
tourana
in
cochin
china
whose
carapace
indicates
that
they
are
all
the
product
of
this
dual
geological
labor
the
islet
of
back
cup
is
in
great
part
formed
of
calcareous
rocks
which
slope
upwards
gently
from
the
lagoon
towards
the
sides
and
are
separated
from
each
other
by
narrow
beaches
of
fine
sand
thick
layers
of
seaweed
that
have
been
swept
through
the
tunnel
by
the
tide
and
thrown
up
around
the
lake
have
been
piled
into
heaps
some
of
which
are
dry
and
some
still
wet
but
all
of
which
exhale
the
strong
odor
of
the
briny
ocean
this
however
is
not
the
only
combustible
employed
by
the
inhabitants
of
back
cup
for
i
see
an
enormous
store
of
coal
that
must
have
been
brought
by
the
schooner
and
the
tug
but
it
is
the
incineration
of
masses
of
dried
seaweed
that
causes
the
smoke
vomited
forth
by
the
crater
of
the
mountain
continuing
my
walk
i
perceive
on
the
northern
side
of
the
lagoon
the
habitations
of
this
colony
of
troglodytes
do
they
not
merit
the
appellation
this
part
of
the
cavern
which
is
known
as
the
beehive
fully
justifies
its
name
for
it
is
honeycombed
by
cells
excavated
in
the
limestone
rock
and
in
which
these
human
bees
or
perhaps
they
should
rather
be
called
wasps
reside
the
lay
of
the
cavern
to
the
east
is
very
different
here
hundreds
of
pillars
of
all
shapes
rise
to
the
dome
and
form
a
veritable
forest
of
stone
trees
through
the
sinuous
avenues
of
which
one
can
thread
way
to
the
extreme
limit
of
the
place
by
counting
the
cells
of
the
beehive
i
calculate
that
count
companions
number
from
eighty
to
one
hundred
as
my
eye
wanders
over
the
place
i
notice
that
the
count
is
standing
in
front
of
one
of
the
cells
which
is
isolated
from
the
others
and
talking
to
engineer
serko
and
captain
spade
after
a
while
they
stroll
down
to
the
jetty
alongside
which
the
tug
is
lying
a
dozen
men
have
been
emptying
the
merchandise
out
of
the
tug
and
transporting
the
goods
in
boats
to
the
other
side
where
great
cellars
have
been
excavated
in
the
rocks
and
form
the
storehouses
of
the
band
the
orifice
of
the
tunnel
is
not
visible
in
the
waters
of
the
lagoon
and
i
remember
that
when
i
was
brought
here
i
felt
the
tug
sink
several
feet
before
it
entered
in
this
respect
therefore
back
cup
does
not
resemble
either
the
grottoes
of
staffa
or
morgate
entrance
to
which
is
always
open
even
at
high
tide
there
may
be
another
passage
communicating
with
the
coast
either
natural
or
artificial
and
this
i
shall
have
to
make
my
business
to
find
out
the
island
well
merits
its
name
of
back
cup
it
is
indeed
a
gigantic
cup
turned
upside
down
not
only
to
outward
appearance
but
inwardly
too
though
people
are
ignorant
of
the
fact
i
have
already
remarked
that
the
beehive
is
situated
to
the
north
of
the
lagoon
that
is
to
say
to
the
left
on
entering
by
the
tunnel
on
the
opposite
side
are
the
storerooms
filled
with
provisions
of
all
kinds
bales
of
merchandise
barrels
of
wine
beer
and
spirits
and
various
packets
bearing
different
marks
and
labels
that
show
that
they
came
from
all
parts
of
the
world
one
would
think
that
the
cargoes
of
a
score
of
ships
had
been
landed
here
a
little
farther
on
is
a
large
wooden
shed
the
nature
of
which
is
easily
distinguishable
from
a
pole
above
it
a
network
of
thick
copper
wires
extends
which
conducts
the
current
to
the
powerful
electric
lights
suspended
from
the
roof
or
dome
and
to
the
incandescent
lamps
in
each
of
the
cells
of
the
hive
a
large
number
of
lamps
are
also
installed
among
the
stone
pillars
and
light
up
the
avenues
to
their
extremities
shall
i
be
permitted
to
roam
about
wherever
i
please
i
ask
myself
i
hope
so
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
see
why
the
count
should
prohibit
me
from
doing
so
for
i
can
not
get
farther
than
the
surrounding
walls
of
his
mysterious
domain
i
question
whether
there
is
any
other
issue
than
the
tunnel
and
how
on
earth
could
i
get
through
that
besides
admitting
that
i
am
able
to
get
through
it
i
can
not
get
off
the
island
my
disappearance
would
be
soon
noticed
and
the
tug
would
take
out
a
dozen
men
who
would
explore
every
nook
and
cranny
i
should
inevitably
be
recaptured
brought
back
to
the
beehive
and
deprived
of
my
liberty
for
good
i
must
therefore
give
up
all
idea
of
making
my
escape
unless
i
can
see
that
it
has
some
chance
of
being
successful
and
if
ever
an
opportunity
does
present
itself
i
shall
not
be
slow
to
take
advantage
of
it
on
strolling
round
by
the
rows
of
cells
i
am
able
to
observe
a
few
of
these
companions
of
the
count
who
are
content
to
pass
their
monotonous
existence
in
the
depths
of
back
cup
as
i
said
before
calculating
from
the
number
of
cells
in
the
beehive
there
must
be
between
eighty
and
a
hundred
of
them
they
pay
no
attention
whatever
to
me
as
i
pass
and
on
examining
them
closely
it
seems
to
me
that
they
must
have
been
recruited
from
every
country
i
do
not
distinguish
any
community
of
origin
among
them
not
even
a
similarity
by
which
they
might
be
classed
as
north
americans
europeans
or
asiatics
the
color
of
their
skin
shades
from
white
to
yellow
and
black
the
black
peculiar
to
australia
rather
than
to
africa
to
sum
up
they
appear
for
the
most
part
to
pertain
to
the
malay
races
i
may
add
that
the
count
certainly
belongs
to
that
particular
race
which
peoples
the
dutch
isles
in
the
west
pacific
while
engineer
serko
must
be
levantine
and
captain
spade
of
italian
origin
but
if
the
inhabitants
of
back
cup
are
not
bound
to
each
other
by
ties
of
race
they
certainly
are
by
instinct
and
inclination
what
forbidding
faces
they
have
to
be
sure
they
are
men
of
violent
character
who
have
probably
never
placed
any
restraint
upon
their
passions
nor
hesitated
at
anything
and
it
occurs
to
me
that
in
all
likelihood
they
have
sought
refuge
in
this
cavern
where
they
fancy
they
can
continue
to
defy
the
law
with
impunity
after
a
long
series
of
crimes
robbery
murder
arson
and
excesses
of
all
descriptions
committed
together
in
this
case
back
cup
is
nothing
but
a
lair
of
pirates
the
count
is
the
leader
of
the
band
and
serko
and
spade
are
his
lieutenants
i
can
not
get
this
idea
out
of
my
head
and
the
more
i
consider
the
more
convinced
i
am
that
i
am
right
especially
as
everything
i
see
during
my
stroll
about
the
cavern
seems
to
confirm
my
opinion
however
this
may
be
and
whatever
may
be
the
circumstances
that
have
brought
them
together
in
this
place
count
companions
appear
to
accept
his
domination
without
question
on
the
other
hand
if
he
keeps
them
under
his
iron
heel
by
enforcing
the
severest
discipline
certain
advantages
some
compensation
must
accrue
from
the
servitude
to
which
they
bow
what
can
this
compensation
be
having
turned
that
part
of
the
bank
under
which
the
tunnel
passes
i
find
myself
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lagoon
where
are
situated
the
storerooms
containing
the
merchandise
brought
by
the
on
each
trip
and
which
contain
a
great
quantity
of
bales
beyond
is
the
manufactory
of
electric
energy
i
gaze
in
at
the
windows
as
i
pass
and
notice
that
it
contains
machines
of
the
latest
invention
and
highest
attained
perfection
which
take
up
little
space
not
one
steam
engine
with
its
more
or
less
complicated
mechanism
and
need
of
fuel
is
to
be
seen
in
the
place
as
i
had
surmised
piles
of
extraordinary
power
supply
the
current
to
the
lamps
in
the
cavern
as
well
as
to
the
dynamos
of
the
tug
no
doubt
the
current
is
also
utilized
for
domestic
purposes
such
as
warming
the
beehive
and
cooking
food
i
can
see
that
in
a
neighboring
cavity
it
is
applied
to
the
alembics
used
to
produce
fresh
water
at
any
rate
the
colonists
of
back
cup
are
not
reduced
to
catching
the
rain
water
that
falls
so
abundantly
upon
the
exterior
of
the
mountain
a
few
paces
from
the
electric
power
house
is
a
large
cistern
that
save
in
the
matter
of
proportions
is
the
counterpart
of
those
i
visited
in
bermuda
in
the
latter
place
the
cisterns
have
to
supply
the
needs
of
over
ten
thousand
people
this
one
of
a
hundred
what
i
am
not
sure
yet
what
to
call
them
that
their
chief
had
serious
reasons
for
choosing
the
bowels
of
this
island
for
his
abiding
place
is
obvious
but
what
were
those
reasons
i
can
understand
monks
shutting
themselves
behind
their
monastery
walls
with
the
intention
of
separating
themselves
from
the
world
but
these
subjects
of
the
count
have
nothing
of
the
monk
about
them
and
would
not
be
mistaken
for
such
by
the
most
of
mortals
i
continue
my
way
through
the
pillars
to
the
extremity
of
the
cavern
no
one
has
sought
to
stop
me
no
one
has
spoken
to
me
not
a
soul
apparently
has
taken
the
very
slightest
notice
of
me
this
portion
of
back
cup
is
extremely
curious
and
comparable
to
the
most
marvellous
of
the
grottoes
of
kentucky
or
the
balearics
i
need
hardly
say
that
nowhere
is
the
labor
of
man
apparent
all
this
is
the
handiwork
of
nature
and
it
is
not
without
wonder
mingled
with
awe
that
i
reflect
upon
the
telluric
forces
capable
of
engendering
such
prodigious
substructions
the
daylight
from
the
crater
in
the
centre
only
strikes
this
part
of
the
cavern
obliquely
so
that
it
is
very
imperfectly
lighted
but
at
night
when
illuminated
by
the
electric
lamps
its
aspect
must
be
positively
fantastic
i
have
examined
the
walls
everywhere
with
minute
attention
but
have
been
unable
to
discover
any
means
of
communicating
with
the
outside
quite
a
colony
of
birds
gulls
and
other
feathery
denizens
of
the
bermudan
beaches
have
made
their
home
in
the
cavern
they
have
apparently
never
been
hunted
for
they
are
in
no
way
disturbed
by
the
presence
of
man
but
besides
which
are
free
to
come
and
go
as
they
please
by
the
orifice
in
the
dome
there
is
a
whole
farmyard
of
domestic
poultry
and
cows
and
pigs
the
food
supply
is
therefore
no
less
assured
than
it
is
varied
when
the
fish
of
all
kinds
that
abound
in
the
lagoon
and
around
the
island
are
taken
into
consideration
moreover
a
mere
glance
at
the
colonists
of
back
cup
amply
suffices
to
show
that
they
are
not
accustomed
to
fare
scantily
they
are
all
vigorous
robust
seafaring
men
weatherbeaten
and
seasoned
in
the
burning
beat
of
tropical
latitudes
whose
rich
blood
is
surcharged
with
oxygen
by
the
breezes
of
the
ocean
there
is
not
a
youth
nor
an
old
man
among
them
they
are
all
in
their
prime
their
ages
ranging
from
thirty
to
fifty
but
why
do
they
submit
to
such
an
existence
do
they
never
leave
their
rocky
retreat
perhaps
i
shall
find
out
ere
i
am
much
older
chapter
ker
karraje
the
cell
in
which
i
reside
is
about
a
hundred
paces
from
the
habitation
of
the
count
which
is
one
of
the
end
ones
of
this
row
of
the
beehive
if
i
am
not
to
share
it
with
thomas
roch
i
presume
the
latter
cell
is
not
far
off
for
in
order
that
warder
gaydon
may
continue
to
care
for
the
of
healthful
house
their
respective
apartments
will
have
to
be
contiguous
however
i
suppose
i
shall
soon
be
enlightened
on
this
point
captain
spade
and
engineer
serko
reside
separately
in
proximity
to
mansion
mansion
yes
why
not
dignify
it
with
the
title
since
this
habitation
has
been
arranged
with
a
certain
art
skillful
hands
have
carved
an
ornamental
façade
in
the
rock
a
large
door
affords
access
to
it
colored
glass
windows
in
wooden
frames
let
into
the
limestone
walls
admit
the
light
the
interior
comprises
several
chambers
a
and
a
lighted
by
a
window
the
whole
being
perfectly
ventilated
the
furniture
is
of
various
styles
and
shapes
and
of
french
english
and
american
make
the
kitchen
larder
are
in
adjoining
cells
in
rear
of
the
beehive
in
the
afternoon
just
as
i
issue
from
my
cell
with
the
firm
intention
of
obtaining
an
audience
of
the
count
i
catch
sight
of
him
coming
along
the
shore
of
the
lagoon
towards
the
hive
either
he
does
not
see
me
or
wishes
to
avoid
me
for
he
quickens
his
steps
and
i
am
unable
to
catch
him
well
he
will
have
to
receive
me
anyhow
i
mutter
to
myself
i
hurry
up
to
the
door
through
which
he
has
just
disappeared
and
which
has
closed
behind
him
it
is
guarded
by
a
gigantic
malay
who
orders
me
away
in
no
amiable
tone
of
voice
i
decline
to
comply
with
his
injunction
and
repeat
to
him
twice
the
following
request
in
my
very
best
english
tell
the
count
that
i
desire
to
be
received
immediately
i
might
just
as
well
have
addressed
myself
to
the
surrounding
rock
this
savage
no
doubt
does
not
understand
a
word
of
english
for
he
scowls
at
me
and
orders
me
away
again
with
a
menacing
cry
i
have
a
good
mind
to
attempt
to
force
the
door
and
shout
so
that
the
count
can
not
fail
to
hear
me
but
in
all
probability
i
shall
only
succeed
in
rousing
the
wrath
of
the
malay
who
appears
to
be
endowed
with
herculean
strength
i
therefore
judge
discretion
to
be
the
better
part
of
valor
and
put
off
the
explanation
that
is
owing
to
me
and
which
sooner
or
later
i
will
have
to
a
more
propitious
occasion
i
meander
off
in
front
of
the
beehive
towards
the
east
and
my
thoughts
revert
to
thomas
roch
i
am
surprised
that
i
have
not
seen
him
yet
can
he
be
in
the
throes
of
a
fresh
paroxysm
this
hypothesis
is
hardly
admissible
for
if
the
count
is
to
be
believed
he
would
in
this
event
have
summoned
me
to
attend
to
the
inventor
a
little
farther
on
i
encounter
engineer
serko
with
his
inviting
manner
and
usual
this
ironical
individual
smiles
when
he
perceives
me
and
does
not
seek
to
avoid
me
if
he
knew
i
was
a
colleague
an
engineer
providing
he
himself
really
is
one
perhaps
he
might
receive
me
with
more
cordiality
than
i
have
yet
encountered
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
such
a
fool
as
to
tell
him
who
and
what
i
am
he
stops
with
laughing
eyes
and
mocking
mouth
and
accompanies
a
good
day
how
do
you
do
with
a
gracious
gesture
of
salutation
i
respond
coldly
to
his
politeness
a
fact
which
he
affects
not
to
notice
may
saint
jonathan
protect
you
mr
gaydon
he
continues
in
his
clear
ringing
voice
you
are
not
i
presume
disposed
to
regret
the
fortunate
circumstance
by
which
you
were
permitted
to
visit
this
surpassingly
marvellous
cavern
and
it
really
is
one
of
the
finest
although
the
least
known
on
this
spheroid
this
word
of
a
scientific
language
used
in
conversation
with
a
simple
hospital
attendant
surprises
me
i
admit
and
i
merely
reply
i
should
have
no
reason
to
complain
serko
if
after
having
had
the
pleasure
of
visiting
this
cavern
i
were
at
liberty
to
quit
it
what
already
thinking
of
leaving
us
gaydon
of
returning
to
your
dismal
pavilion
at
healthful
house
why
you
have
scarcely
had
time
to
explore
our
magnificent
domain
or
to
admire
the
incomparable
beauty
with
which
nature
has
endowed
it
what
i
have
seen
suffices
i
answer
and
should
you
perchance
be
talking
seriously
i
will
assure
you
seriously
that
i
do
not
want
to
see
any
more
of
it
come
now
gaydon
permit
me
to
point
out
that
you
have
not
yet
had
the
opportunity
of
appreciating
the
advantages
of
an
existence
passed
in
such
unrivalled
surroundings
it
is
a
quiet
life
exempt
from
care
with
an
assured
future
material
conditions
such
as
are
not
to
be
met
with
anywhere
an
even
climate
and
no
more
to
fear
from
the
tempests
which
desolate
the
coasts
in
this
part
of
the
atlantic
than
from
the
cold
of
winter
or
the
heat
of
summer
this
temperate
and
salubrious
atmosphere
is
scarcely
affected
by
changes
of
season
here
we
have
no
need
to
apprehend
the
wrath
of
either
pluto
or
neptune
sir
i
reply
it
is
impossible
that
this
climate
can
suit
you
that
you
can
appreciate
living
in
this
grotto
of
i
was
on
the
point
of
pronouncing
the
name
of
back
cup
fortunately
i
restrained
myself
in
time
what
would
happen
if
they
suspected
that
i
am
aware
of
the
name
of
their
island
and
consequently
of
its
position
at
the
extremity
of
the
bermuda
group
however
i
continue
if
this
climate
does
not
suit
me
i
have
i
presume
the
right
to
make
a
change
the
right
of
course
i
understand
from
your
remark
that
i
shall
be
furnished
with
the
means
of
returning
to
america
when
i
want
to
go
i
have
no
reason
for
opposing
your
desires
gaydon
engineer
serko
replies
and
i
regard
your
presumption
as
a
very
natural
one
observe
however
that
we
live
here
in
a
noble
and
superb
independence
that
we
acknowledge
the
authority
of
no
foreign
power
that
we
are
subject
to
no
outside
authority
that
we
are
the
colonists
of
no
state
either
of
the
old
or
new
world
this
is
worth
consideration
by
whomsoever
has
a
sense
of
pride
and
independence
besides
what
memories
are
evoked
in
a
cultivated
mind
by
these
grottoes
which
seem
to
have
been
chiselled
by
the
hands
of
the
gods
and
in
which
they
were
wont
to
render
their
oracles
by
the
mouth
of
trophonius
decidedly
engineer
serko
is
fond
of
citing
mythology
trophonius
after
pluto
and
neptune
does
he
imagine
that
warder
gaydon
ever
heard
of
trophonius
it
is
clear
this
mocker
continues
to
mock
and
i
have
to
exercise
the
greatest
patience
in
order
not
to
reply
in
the
same
tone
a
moment
ago
i
continue
shortly
i
wanted
to
enter
yon
habitation
which
if
i
mistake
not
is
that
of
the
count
but
i
was
prevented
by
whom
mr
gaydon
by
a
man
in
the
count
employ
he
probably
had
received
strict
orders
about
it
possibly
yet
whether
he
likes
it
or
not
count
will
have
to
see
me
and
listen
to
me
maybe
it
would
be
difficult
and
even
impossible
to
get
him
to
do
so
says
engineer
serko
with
a
smile
why
so
because
there
is
no
such
person
as
count
here
you
are
jesting
i
presume
i
have
just
seen
him
it
was
not
the
count
whom
you
saw
mr
gaydon
who
was
it
then
may
i
ask
the
pirate
ker
karraje
this
name
was
thrown
at
me
in
a
hard
tone
of
voice
and
engineer
serko
walked
off
before
i
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
detain
him
the
pirate
ker
karraje
yes
this
name
is
a
revelation
to
me
i
know
it
well
and
what
memories
it
evokes
it
by
itself
explains
what
has
hitherto
been
inexplicable
to
me
i
now
know
into
whose
hands
i
have
fallen
with
what
i
already
knew
with
what
i
have
learned
since
my
arrival
in
back
cup
from
engineer
serko
this
is
what
i
am
able
to
tell
about
the
past
and
present
of
ker
karraje
eight
or
nine
years
ago
the
west
pacific
was
infested
by
pirates
who
acted
with
the
greatest
audacity
a
band
of
criminals
of
various
origins
composed
of
escaped
convicts
military
and
naval
deserters
operated
with
incredible
audacity
under
the
orders
of
a
redoubtable
chief
the
nucleus
of
the
band
had
been
formed
by
men
pertaining
to
the
scum
of
europe
who
had
been
attracted
to
new
south
wales
in
australia
by
the
discovery
of
gold
there
among
these
were
captain
spade
and
engineer
serko
two
outcasts
whom
a
certain
community
of
ideas
and
character
soon
bound
together
in
close
friendship
these
intelligent
well
educated
resolute
men
would
most
assuredly
have
succeeded
in
any
career
but
being
without
conscience
or
scruples
and
determined
to
get
rich
at
no
matter
what
cost
deriving
from
gambling
and
speculation
what
they
might
have
earned
by
patient
and
steady
work
they
engaged
in
all
sorts
of
impossible
adventures
one
day
they
were
rich
the
next
day
poor
like
most
of
the
questionable
individuals
who
had
hurried
to
the
in
search
of
fortune
among
the
diggers
in
new
south
wales
was
a
man
of
incomparable
audacity
one
of
those
men
who
stick
at
nothing
not
even
at
crime
and
whose
influence
upon
bad
and
violent
natures
is
irresistible
that
man
name
was
ker
karraje
the
origin
or
nationality
or
antecedents
of
this
pirate
were
never
established
by
the
investigations
ordered
in
regard
to
him
he
eluded
all
pursuit
and
his
name
or
at
least
the
name
he
gave
himself
was
known
all
over
the
world
and
inspired
horror
and
terror
everywhere
as
being
that
of
a
legendary
personage
a
bogey
invisible
and
unseizable
i
have
now
reason
to
believe
that
ker
karraje
is
a
malay
however
it
is
of
little
consequence
after
all
what
is
certain
is
that
he
was
with
reason
regarded
as
a
formidable
and
dangerous
villain
who
had
many
crimes
committed
in
distant
seas
to
answer
for
after
spending
a
few
years
on
the
australian
goldfields
where
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
engineer
serko
and
captain
spade
ker
karraje
managed
to
seize
a
ship
in
the
port
of
melbourne
in
the
province
of
victoria
he
was
joined
by
about
thirty
rascals
whose
number
was
speedily
tripled
in
that
part
of
the
pacific
ocean
where
piracy
is
still
carried
on
with
great
facility
and
i
may
say
profit
the
number
of
ships
pillaged
crews
massacred
and
raids
committed
in
certain
western
islands
which
the
colonists
were
unable
to
defend
can
not
be
estimated
although
the
whereabouts
of
ker
karraje
vessel
commanded
by
captain
spade
was
several
times
made
known
to
the
authorities
all
attempts
to
capture
it
proved
futile
the
marauder
would
disappear
among
the
innumerable
islands
of
which
he
knew
every
cove
and
creek
and
it
was
impossible
to
come
across
him
he
maintained
a
perfect
reign
of
terror
england
france
germany
russia
and
america
vainly
dispatched
warships
in
pursuit
of
the
phantom
vessel
which
disappeared
no
one
knew
whither
after
robberies
and
murders
that
could
not
be
prevented
or
punished
had
been
committed
by
her
crew
one
day
this
series
of
crimes
came
to
an
end
and
no
more
was
heard
of
ker
karraje
had
he
abandoned
the
pacific
for
other
seas
would
this
pirate
break
out
in
a
fresh
place
it
was
argued
that
notwithstanding
what
they
must
have
spent
in
orgies
and
debauchery
the
pirate
and
his
companions
must
still
have
an
enormous
amount
of
wealth
hidden
in
some
place
known
only
to
themselves
and
that
they
were
enjoying
their
gains
where
had
the
band
hidden
themselves
since
they
had
ceased
their
depredations
this
was
a
question
which
everybody
asked
and
none
was
able
to
answer
all
attempts
to
run
them
to
earth
were
vain
terror
and
uneasiness
having
ceased
with
the
danger
ker
karraje
exploits
soon
began
to
be
forgotten
even
in
the
west
pacific
this
is
what
had
happened
and
what
will
never
be
known
unless
i
succeed
in
escaping
from
back
cup
these
wretches
were
as
a
matter
of
fact
possessed
of
great
wealth
when
they
abandoned
the
southern
seas
having
destroyed
their
ship
they
dispersed
in
different
directions
after
having
arranged
to
meet
on
the
american
continent
engineer
serko
who
was
well
versed
in
his
profession
and
was
a
clever
mechanic
to
boot
and
who
had
made
a
special
study
of
submarine
craft
proposed
to
ker
karraje
that
they
should
construct
one
of
these
boats
in
order
to
continue
their
criminal
exploits
with
greater
secrecy
and
effectiveness
ker
karraje
at
once
saw
the
practical
nature
of
the
proposition
and
as
they
had
no
lack
of
money
the
idea
was
soon
carried
out
while
the
count
ordered
the
construction
of
the
schooner
at
the
shipyards
of
gotteborg
in
sweden
he
gave
to
the
cramps
of
philadelphia
in
america
the
plans
of
a
submarine
boat
whose
construction
excited
no
suspicion
besides
as
will
be
seen
it
soon
disappeared
and
was
never
heard
of
again
the
boat
was
constructed
from
a
model
and
under
the
personal
supervision
of
engineer
serko
and
fitted
with
all
the
known
appliances
of
nautical
science
the
screw
was
worked
with
electric
piles
of
recent
invention
which
imparted
enormous
propulsive
power
to
the
motor
it
goes
without
saying
that
no
one
imagined
that
count
was
none
other
than
ker
karraje
the
former
pirate
of
the
pacific
and
that
engineer
serko
was
the
most
formidable
and
resolute
of
his
accomplices
the
former
was
regarded
as
a
foreigner
of
noble
birth
and
great
fortune
who
for
several
months
had
been
frequenting
the
ports
of
the
united
states
the
having
been
launched
long
before
the
tug
was
ready
work
upon
the
latter
occupied
fully
eighteen
months
and
when
the
boat
was
finished
it
excited
the
admiration
of
all
those
interested
in
these
engines
of
submarine
navigation
by
its
external
form
its
interior
arrangements
its
system
the
rapidity
with
which
it
could
be
immersed
the
facility
with
which
it
could
be
handled
and
controlled
and
its
extraordinary
speed
it
was
conceded
to
be
far
superior
to
the
the
the
and
other
similar
boats
which
had
made
great
strides
towards
perfection
after
several
extremely
successful
experiments
a
public
test
was
given
in
the
open
sea
four
miles
off
charleston
in
presence
of
several
american
and
foreign
warships
merchant
vessels
and
pleasure
boats
invited
for
the
occasion
of
course
the
was
among
them
with
the
count
engineer
serko
and
captain
spade
on
board
and
the
old
crew
as
well
save
half
a
dozen
men
who
manned
the
submarine
machine
which
was
worked
by
a
mechanical
engineer
named
gibson
a
bold
and
very
clever
englishman
the
programme
of
this
definite
experiment
comprised
various
evolutions
on
the
surface
of
the
water
which
were
to
be
followed
by
an
immersion
to
last
several
hours
the
boat
being
ordered
not
to
rise
again
until
a
certain
buoy
stationed
many
miles
out
at
sea
had
been
attained
at
the
appointed
time
the
lid
was
closed
and
the
boat
at
first
manoeuvred
on
the
surface
her
speed
and
the
ease
with
which
she
turned
and
twisted
were
loudly
praised
by
all
the
technical
spectators
then
at
a
signal
given
on
board
the
the
tug
sank
slowly
out
of
sight
and
several
vessels
started
for
the
buoy
where
she
was
to
reappear
three
hours
went
by
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
boat
no
one
could
suppose
that
in
accordance
with
instructions
received
from
the
count
and
engineer
serko
this
submarine
machine
which
was
destined
to
act
as
the
invisible
tug
of
the
schooner
would
not
emerge
till
it
had
gone
several
miles
beyond
the
rendezvous
therefore
with
the
exception
of
those
who
were
in
the
secret
no
one
entertained
any
doubt
that
the
boat
and
all
inside
her
had
perished
as
the
result
of
an
accident
either
to
her
metallic
covering
or
machinery
on
board
the
consternation
was
admirably
simulated
on
board
the
other
vessels
it
was
real
drags
were
used
and
divers
sent
down
along
the
course
the
boat
was
supposed
to
have
taken
but
it
could
not
be
found
and
it
was
agreed
that
it
had
been
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
the
atlantic
two
days
later
the
count
put
to
sea
again
and
in
hours
came
up
with
the
tug
at
the
place
appointed
this
is
how
ker
karraje
became
possessed
of
the
admirable
vessel
which
was
to
perform
the
double
function
of
towing
the
schooner
and
attacking
ships
with
this
terrible
engine
of
destruction
whose
very
existence
was
ignored
the
count
was
able
to
recommence
his
career
of
piracy
with
security
and
impunity
these
details
i
have
learned
from
engineer
serko
who
is
very
proud
of
his
handiwork
and
also
very
positive
that
the
prisoner
of
back
cup
will
never
be
able
to
disclose
the
secret
it
will
easily
be
realized
how
powerful
was
the
offensive
weapon
ker
karraje
now
possessed
during
the
night
the
tug
would
rush
at
a
merchant
vessel
and
bore
a
hole
in
her
with
its
powerful
ram
at
the
same
time
the
schooner
which
could
not
possibly
have
excited
any
suspicion
would
run
alongside
and
her
horde
of
cutthroats
would
pour
on
to
the
doomed
vessel
deck
and
massacre
the
helpless
crew
after
which
they
would
hurriedly
transfer
that
part
of
the
cargo
that
was
worth
taking
to
the
thus
it
happened
that
ship
after
ship
was
added
to
the
long
list
of
those
that
never
reached
port
and
were
classed
as
having
gone
down
with
all
on
board
for
a
year
after
the
odious
comedy
in
the
bay
of
charleston
ker
karraje
operated
in
the
atlantic
and
his
wealth
increased
to
enormous
proportions
the
merchandise
for
which
he
had
no
use
was
disposed
of
in
distant
markets
in
exchange
for
gold
and
silver
but
what
was
sadly
needed
was
a
place
where
the
profits
could
be
safely
hidden
pending
the
time
when
they
were
to
be
finally
divided
chance
came
to
their
aid
while
exploring
the
bottom
of
the
sea
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
bermudas
engineer
serko
and
driver
gibson
discovered
at
the
base
of
back
cup
island
the
tunnel
which
led
to
the
interior
of
the
mountain
would
it
have
been
possible
for
ker
karraje
to
have
found
a
more
admirable
refuge
than
this
absolutely
safe
as
it
was
from
any
possible
chance
of
discovery
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
one
of
the
islands
of
the
archipelago
of
bermuda
erstwhile
the
haunt
of
buccaneers
became
the
lair
of
another
gang
a
good
deal
more
to
be
dreaded
this
retreat
having
been
definitely
adopted
count
and
his
companions
set
about
getting
their
place
in
order
engineer
serko
installed
an
electric
power
house
without
having
recourse
to
machines
whose
construction
abroad
might
have
aroused
suspicion
simply
employing
piles
that
could
be
easily
mounted
and
required
but
metal
plates
and
chemical
substances
that
the
procured
during
her
visits
to
the
american
coast
what
happened
on
the
night
of
the
inst
can
easily
be
divined
if
the
merchantman
which
lay
becalmed
was
not
visible
at
break
of
day
it
was
because
she
had
been
scuttled
by
the
tug
boarded
by
the
band
on
the
and
sunk
with
all
on
board
after
being
pillaged
the
bales
and
things
that
i
had
seen
on
the
schooner
were
a
part
of
her
cargo
and
all
unknown
to
me
the
gallant
ship
was
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
broad
atlantic
how
will
this
adventure
end
shall
i
ever
be
able
to
escape
from
back
cup
denounce
the
false
count
and
rid
the
seas
of
ker
karraje
pirates
and
if
ker
karraje
is
terrible
as
it
is
how
much
more
so
will
he
become
if
he
ever
obtains
possession
of
roch
fulgurator
his
power
will
be
increased
a
if
he
were
able
to
employ
this
new
engine
of
destruction
no
merchantman
could
resist
him
no
warship
escape
total
destruction
i
remain
for
some
time
absorbed
and
oppressed
by
the
reflections
with
which
the
revelation
of
ker
karraje
name
inspires
me
all
that
i
have
ever
heard
about
this
famous
pirate
recurs
to
me
his
existence
when
he
skimmed
the
southern
seas
the
useless
expeditions
organized
by
the
maritime
powers
to
hunt
him
down
the
unaccountable
loss
of
so
many
vessels
in
the
atlantic
during
the
past
few
years
is
attributable
to
him
he
had
merely
changed
the
scene
of
his
exploits
it
was
supposed
that
he
had
been
got
rid
of
whereas
he
is
continuing
his
piratical
practices
in
the
most
frequented
ocean
on
the
globe
by
means
of
the
tug
which
is
believed
to
be
lying
at
the
bottom
of
charleston
bay
now
i
say
to
myself
i
know
his
real
name
and
that
of
his
lair
ker
karraje
and
back
cup
and
i
surmise
that
if
engineer
serko
has
let
me
into
the
secret
he
must
have
been
authorized
to
do
so
am
i
not
meant
to
understand
from
this
that
i
must
give
up
all
hope
of
ever
recovering
my
liberty
engineer
serko
had
manifestly
remarked
the
impression
created
upon
me
by
this
revelation
i
remember
that
on
leaving
me
he
went
towards
ker
karraje
habitation
no
doubt
with
the
intention
of
apprising
him
of
what
had
passed
after
a
rather
long
walk
around
the
lagoon
i
am
about
to
return
to
my
cell
when
i
hear
footsteps
behind
me
i
turn
and
find
myself
face
to
face
with
the
count
who
is
accompanied
by
captain
spade
he
glances
at
me
sharply
and
in
a
burst
of
irritation
that
i
can
not
suppress
i
exclaim
you
are
keeping
me
here
sir
against
all
right
if
it
was
to
wait
upon
thomas
roch
that
you
carried
me
off
from
healthful
house
i
refuse
to
attend
to
him
and
insist
upon
being
sent
back
the
pirate
chief
makes
a
gesture
but
does
not
reply
then
my
temper
gets
the
better
of
me
altogether
answer
me
count
or
rather
for
i
know
who
you
are
answer
me
ker
karraje
i
shout
the
count
is
ker
karraje
he
coolly
replies
just
as
warder
gaydon
is
engineer
simon
hart
and
ker
karraje
will
never
restore
to
liberty
engineer
simon
hart
who
knows
his
secrets
chapter
xi
five
weeks
in
back
cup
the
situation
is
plain
ker
karraje
knows
who
i
am
he
knew
who
i
was
when
he
kidnapped
thomas
roch
and
his
attendant
how
did
this
man
manage
to
find
out
what
i
was
able
to
keep
from
the
staff
of
healthful
house
how
comes
it
that
he
knew
that
a
french
engineer
was
performing
the
duties
of
attendant
to
thomas
roch
i
do
not
know
how
he
discovered
it
but
the
fact
remains
that
he
did
evidently
he
had
means
of
information
which
must
have
been
costly
but
from
which
he
has
derived
considerable
profit
besides
men
of
his
kidney
do
not
count
the
cost
when
they
wish
to
attain
an
end
they
have
in
view
henceforward
ker
karraje
or
rather
engineer
serko
will
replace
me
as
attendant
upon
thomas
roch
will
he
succeed
better
than
i
did
god
grant
that
he
may
not
that
the
civilized
world
may
be
spared
such
a
misfortune
i
did
not
reply
to
ker
karraje
parthian
shot
for
i
was
stricken
dumb
i
did
not
however
collapse
as
the
alleged
count
perhaps
expected
i
would
no
i
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
which
glittered
angrily
and
crossed
my
arms
defiantly
as
he
had
done
and
yet
he
held
my
life
in
his
hands
at
a
sign
a
bullet
would
have
laid
me
dead
at
his
feet
then
my
body
cast
into
the
lagoon
would
have
been
borne
out
to
sea
through
the
tunnel
and
there
would
have
been
an
end
of
me
after
this
scene
i
am
left
at
liberty
just
as
before
no
measure
is
taken
against
me
i
can
walk
among
the
pillars
to
the
very
end
of
the
cavern
which
it
is
only
too
clear
possesses
no
other
issue
except
the
tunnel
when
i
return
to
my
cell
at
the
extremity
of
the
beehive
a
prey
to
a
thousand
thoughts
suggested
by
my
situation
i
say
to
myself
if
ker
karraje
knows
i
am
simon
hart
the
engineer
he
must
at
any
rate
never
know
that
i
am
aware
of
the
position
of
back
cup
island
as
to
the
plan
of
confiding
thomas
roch
to
my
care
i
do
not
think
he
ever
seriously
entertained
it
seeing
that
my
identity
had
been
revealed
to
him
i
regret
this
inasmuch
as
the
inventor
will
indubitably
be
the
object
of
pressing
solicitations
and
as
engineer
serko
will
employ
every
means
in
his
power
to
obtain
the
composition
of
the
explosive
and
deflagrator
of
which
he
will
make
such
detestable
use
during
future
piratical
exploits
yes
it
would
have
been
far
better
if
i
could
have
remained
thomas
roch
keeper
here
as
in
healthful
house
for
fifteen
days
i
see
nothing
of
my
late
charge
no
one
i
repeat
has
placed
any
obstacles
in
the
way
of
my
daily
peregrinations
i
have
no
need
to
occupy
myself
about
the
material
part
of
my
existence
my
meals
are
brought
to
me
regularly
direct
from
the
kitchen
of
the
count
i
can
not
accustom
myself
to
calling
him
by
any
other
name
the
food
leaves
nothing
to
be
desired
thanks
to
the
provisions
that
the
brings
on
her
return
from
each
voyage
it
is
very
fortunate
too
that
i
have
been
supplied
with
all
the
writing
materials
i
require
for
during
my
long
hours
of
idleness
i
have
been
able
to
jot
down
in
my
notebook
the
slightest
incidents
that
have
occurred
since
i
was
abducted
from
healthful
house
and
to
keep
a
diary
day
by
day
as
long
as
i
am
permitted
to
use
a
pen
i
shall
continue
my
notes
mayhap
some
day
they
will
help
to
clear
up
the
mysteries
of
back
cup
july
to
july
a
fortnight
has
passed
and
all
my
attempts
to
get
near
thomas
roch
have
been
frustrated
orders
have
evidently
been
given
to
keep
him
away
from
my
influence
inefficacious
though
the
latter
has
hitherto
been
my
only
hope
is
that
the
count
engineer
serko
and
captain
spade
will
waste
their
time
trying
to
get
at
the
inventor
secrets
three
or
four
times
to
my
knowledge
at
least
thomas
roch
and
engineer
serko
have
walked
together
around
the
lagoon
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
judge
the
former
listened
with
some
attention
to
what
the
other
was
saying
to
him
serko
has
conducted
him
over
the
whole
cavern
shown
him
the
electric
power
house
and
the
mechanism
of
the
tug
thomas
roch
mental
condition
has
visibly
improved
since
his
departure
from
healthful
house
thomas
roch
lives
in
a
private
room
in
ker
karraje
mansion
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
is
daily
sounded
in
regard
to
his
discoveries
especially
by
engineer
serko
will
he
be
able
to
resist
the
temptation
if
they
offer
him
the
exorbitant
price
that
he
demands
has
he
any
idea
of
the
value
of
money
these
wretches
may
dazzle
him
with
the
gold
that
they
have
accumulated
by
years
of
rapine
in
the
present
state
of
his
mind
may
he
not
be
induced
to
disclose
the
composition
of
his
fulgurator
they
would
then
only
have
to
fetch
the
necessary
substances
and
thomas
roch
would
have
plenty
of
time
in
back
cup
to
devote
to
his
chemical
combinations
as
to
the
themselves
nothing
would
be
easier
than
to
have
them
made
in
sections
in
different
parts
of
the
american
continent
my
hair
stands
on
end
when
i
think
what
they
could
and
would
do
with
them
if
once
they
gained
possession
of
them
these
intolerable
apprehensions
no
longer
leave
me
a
minute
peace
they
are
wearing
me
out
and
my
health
is
suffering
in
consequence
although
the
air
in
the
interior
of
back
cup
is
pure
i
become
subject
to
attacks
of
suffocation
and
i
feel
as
though
my
prison
walls
were
falling
upon
me
and
crushing
me
under
their
weight
i
am
besides
oppressed
by
the
feeling
that
i
am
cut
off
from
the
world
as
effectually
as
though
i
were
no
longer
upon
our
planet
for
i
know
nothing
of
what
is
going
on
outside
ah
if
it
were
only
possible
to
escape
through
that
submarine
tunnel
or
through
the
hole
in
the
dome
and
slide
to
the
base
of
the
mountain
on
the
morning
of
the
i
at
last
encounter
thomas
roch
he
is
alone
on
the
other
side
of
the
lagoon
and
i
wonder
inasmuch
as
i
have
not
seen
them
since
the
previous
day
whether
ker
karraje
engineer
serko
and
captain
spade
have
not
gone
off
on
some
expedition
i
walk
round
towards
thomas
roch
and
before
he
can
see
me
i
examine
him
attentively
his
serious
thoughtful
physiognomy
is
no
longer
that
of
a
madman
he
walks
slowly
with
his
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
and
under
his
arm
a
upon
which
is
stretched
a
sheet
of
paper
covered
with
designs
suddenly
he
raises
his
head
advances
a
step
and
recognizes
me
ah
gaydon
it
is
you
is
it
he
cries
i
have
then
escaped
from
you
i
am
free
he
can
indeed
regard
himself
as
being
free
a
good
deal
more
at
liberty
in
back
cup
than
he
was
in
healthful
house
but
maybe
my
presence
evokes
unpleasant
memories
and
will
bring
on
another
fit
for
he
continues
with
extraordinary
animation
yes
i
know
you
do
not
approach
me
stand
off
stand
off
you
would
like
to
get
me
back
in
your
clutches
incarcerate
me
again
in
your
dungeon
never
i
have
friends
here
who
will
protect
me
they
are
powerful
they
are
rich
the
count
is
my
backer
and
engineer
serko
is
my
partner
we
are
going
to
exploit
my
invention
we
are
going
to
make
my
fulgurator
hence
get
you
gone
thomas
roch
is
in
a
perfect
fury
he
raises
his
voice
agitates
his
arms
and
finally
pulls
from
his
pockets
many
rolls
of
dollar
bills
and
banknotes
and
handfuls
of
english
french
american
and
german
gold
coins
which
slip
through
his
fingers
and
roll
about
the
cavern
how
could
he
get
all
this
money
except
from
ker
karraje
and
as
the
price
of
his
secret
the
noise
he
makes
attracts
a
number
of
men
to
the
scene
they
watch
us
for
a
moment
then
seize
thomas
roch
and
drag
him
away
as
soon
as
i
am
out
of
his
sight
he
struggle
and
becomes
calm
again
two
hours
after
meeting
with
thomas
roch
i
went
down
to
the
lagoon
and
walked
out
to
the
edge
of
the
stone
jetty
the
tug
is
not
moored
in
its
accustomed
place
nor
can
i
see
it
anywhere
about
the
lake
ker
karraje
and
engineer
serko
had
not
gone
yesterday
as
i
supposed
for
i
saw
them
in
the
evening
however
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
they
really
have
gone
away
in
the
tug
with
captain
spade
and
the
crew
of
the
and
that
the
latter
must
be
sailing
away
have
they
set
out
on
a
piracy
expedition
very
likely
it
is
equally
likely
that
ker
karraje
become
once
more
the
count
travelling
for
pleasure
on
board
his
yacht
intends
to
put
into
some
port
on
the
american
coast
to
procure
the
substances
necessary
to
the
preparation
of
roch
fulgurator
ah
if
it
had
only
been
possible
for
me
to
hide
in
the
tug
to
slip
into
the
hold
and
stow
myself
away
there
until
the
schooner
arrived
in
port
then
perchance
i
might
have
escaped
and
delivered
the
world
from
this
band
of
pirates
it
will
be
seen
how
tenaciously
i
cling
to
the
thought
of
escape
of
fleeing
fleeing
at
any
cost
from
this
lair
but
flight
is
impossible
except
through
the
tunnel
by
means
of
a
submarine
boat
is
it
not
folly
to
think
of
such
a
thing
sheer
folly
and
yet
what
other
way
is
there
of
getting
out
of
back
cup
while
i
give
myself
up
to
these
reflections
the
water
of
the
lagoon
opens
a
few
yards
from
me
and
the
tug
appears
the
lid
is
raised
and
gibson
the
engineer
and
the
men
issue
on
to
the
platform
other
men
come
up
and
catch
the
line
that
is
thrown
to
them
they
haul
upon
it
and
the
tug
is
soon
moored
in
its
accustomed
place
this
time
therefore
at
any
rate
the
schooner
is
not
being
towed
and
the
tug
merely
went
out
to
put
ker
karraje
and
his
companions
aboard
the
this
only
confirms
my
impression
that
the
sole
object
of
their
trip
is
to
reach
an
american
port
where
the
count
can
procure
the
materials
for
making
the
explosive
and
order
the
machines
in
some
foundry
on
the
day
fixed
for
their
return
the
tug
will
go
out
through
the
tunnel
again
to
meet
the
schooner
and
ker
karraje
will
return
to
back
cup
decidedly
this
evildoer
is
carrying
out
his
designs
and
has
succeeded
sooner
than
i
thought
would
be
possible
an
incident
occurred
of
which
the
lagoon
was
the
theatre
a
very
curious
incident
that
must
be
exceedingly
rare
towards
three
in
the
afternoon
there
was
a
prodigious
bubbling
in
the
water
which
ceased
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
recommenced
in
the
centre
of
the
lagoon
about
fifteen
pirates
whose
attention
had
been
attracted
by
this
unaccountable
phenomenon
hurried
down
to
the
bank
manifesting
signs
of
astonishment
not
unmingled
with
fear
at
least
i
thought
so
the
agitation
of
the
water
was
not
caused
by
the
tug
as
the
latter
was
lying
alongside
the
jetty
and
the
idea
that
some
other
submarine
boat
had
found
its
way
through
the
tunnel
was
highly
improbable
almost
at
the
same
instant
cries
were
heard
on
the
opposite
bank
the
newcomers
shouted
something
in
a
hoarse
voice
to
the
men
on
the
side
where
i
was
standing
and
these
immediately
rushed
off
towards
the
beehive
i
conjectured
that
they
had
caught
sight
of
some
that
had
found
its
way
in
and
was
floundering
in
the
lagoon
and
that
they
had
rushed
off
to
fetch
arms
and
harpoons
to
try
and
capture
it
i
was
right
for
they
speedily
returned
with
the
latter
weapons
and
rifles
loaded
with
explosive
bullets
the
monster
in
question
was
a
whale
of
the
species
that
is
common
enough
in
bermudan
waters
which
after
swimming
through
the
tunnel
was
plunging
about
in
the
narrow
limits
of
the
lake
as
it
was
constrained
to
take
refuge
in
back
cup
i
concluded
that
it
must
have
been
hard
pressed
by
whalers
some
minutes
elapsed
before
the
monster
rose
to
the
surface
then
the
green
shiny
mass
appeared
spouting
furiously
and
darting
to
and
fro
as
though
fighting
with
some
formidable
enemy
if
it
was
driven
in
here
by
whalers
i
said
to
myself
there
must
be
a
vessel
in
proximity
to
back
cup
peradventure
within
a
throw
of
it
her
boats
must
have
entered
the
western
passes
to
the
very
foot
of
the
mountain
and
to
think
i
am
unable
to
communicate
with
them
but
even
if
i
could
i
fail
to
see
how
i
could
go
to
them
through
these
massive
walls
i
soon
found
however
that
it
was
not
fishers
but
sharks
that
had
driven
the
whale
through
the
tunnel
and
which
infest
these
waters
in
great
numbers
i
could
see
them
plainly
as
they
darted
about
turning
upon
their
backs
and
displaying
their
enormous
mouths
which
were
bristling
with
their
cruel
teeth
there
were
five
or
six
of
the
monsters
and
they
attacked
the
whale
with
great
viciousness
the
latter
only
means
of
defence
was
its
tail
with
which
it
lashed
at
them
with
terrific
force
and
rapidity
but
the
whale
had
received
several
wounds
and
the
water
was
tinged
with
its
for
plunge
and
lash
as
it
would
it
could
not
escape
the
bites
of
its
enemies
however
the
voracious
sharks
were
not
permitted
to
vanquish
their
prey
for
man
far
more
powerful
with
his
instruments
of
death
was
about
to
take
a
hand
and
snatch
it
from
them
gathered
around
the
lagoon
were
the
companions
of
ker
karraje
every
whit
as
ferocious
as
the
sharks
themselves
and
well
deserving
the
same
name
for
what
else
are
they
standing
amid
a
group
at
the
extremity
of
the
jetty
and
armed
with
a
harpoon
was
the
big
malay
who
had
prevented
me
from
entering
ker
karraje
house
when
the
whale
got
within
shot
he
hurled
the
harpoon
with
great
force
and
skill
and
it
sank
into
the
leviathan
flesh
just
under
the
left
fin
the
whale
plunged
immediately
followed
by
the
relentless
sharks
the
rope
attached
to
the
weapon
ran
out
for
about
sixty
yards
and
then
slackened
the
men
at
once
began
to
haul
on
it
and
the
monster
rose
to
the
surface
again
near
the
end
of
the
tunnel
struggling
desperately
in
its
death
agony
and
spurting
great
columns
of
water
tinged
with
blood
one
blow
of
its
tail
struck
a
shark
and
hurled
it
clean
out
of
water
against
the
rocky
side
where
it
dropped
in
again
badly
if
not
fatally
injured
the
harpoon
was
torn
from
the
flesh
by
the
jerk
and
the
whale
went
under
it
came
up
again
for
the
last
time
and
lashed
the
water
so
that
it
washed
up
from
the
tunnel
end
disclosing
the
top
of
the
orifice
then
the
sharks
again
rushed
on
their
prey
but
were
scared
off
by
a
hail
of
the
explosive
bullets
two
men
then
jumped
into
a
boat
and
attached
a
line
to
the
dead
monster
the
latter
was
hauled
into
the
jetty
and
the
malays
started
to
cut
it
up
with
a
dexterity
that
showed
they
were
no
novices
at
the
work
no
more
sharks
were
to
be
seen
but
i
concluded
that
it
would
be
as
well
to
refrain
from
taking
a
bath
in
the
lagoon
for
some
days
to
come
i
now
know
exactly
where
the
entrance
to
the
tunnel
is
situated
the
orifice
on
this
side
is
only
ten
feet
below
the
edge
of
the
western
bank
but
of
what
use
is
this
knowledge
to
me
twelve
days
have
elapsed
since
the
count
engineer
serko
and
captain
spade
put
to
sea
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
their
return
is
expected
though
the
tug
is
always
kept
in
readiness
for
immediate
departure
by
gibson
the
if
the
is
not
afraid
to
enter
the
ports
of
the
united
states
by
day
i
rather
fancy
she
prefers
to
enter
the
rocky
channel
of
back
cup
at
nightfall
i
also
fancy
somehow
that
ker
karraje
and
his
companions
will
return
at
ten
last
night
as
i
anticipated
the
tug
went
under
and
out
just
in
time
to
meet
the
and
tow
her
through
the
channel
to
her
creek
after
which
she
returned
with
ker
karraje
and
the
others
when
i
look
out
this
morning
i
see
thomas
roch
and
engineer
serko
walking
down
to
the
lagoon
and
talking
what
they
are
talking
about
i
can
easily
guess
i
go
forward
and
take
a
good
look
at
my
he
is
asking
questions
of
engineer
serko
with
great
animation
his
eyes
gleam
his
face
is
flushed
and
he
is
all
eagerness
to
reach
the
jetty
engineer
serko
can
hardly
keep
up
with
him
the
crew
of
the
tug
are
unloading
her
and
they
have
just
brought
ashore
ten
boxes
these
boxes
bear
a
peculiar
red
mark
which
thomas
roch
examines
closely
engineer
serko
orders
the
men
to
transport
them
to
the
storehouses
on
the
left
bank
and
the
boxes
are
forthwith
loaded
on
a
boat
and
rowed
over
in
my
opinion
these
boxes
contain
the
substances
by
the
combination
or
mixture
of
which
the
fulgurator
and
deflagrator
are
to
be
made
the
engines
doubtless
are
being
made
in
an
american
foundry
and
when
they
are
ready
the
schooner
will
fetch
them
and
bring
them
to
back
cup
for
once
in
a
while
anyhow
the
has
not
returned
with
any
stolen
merchandise
she
went
out
and
has
returned
with
a
clear
bill
but
with
what
terrible
power
ker
karraje
will
be
armed
for
both
offensive
and
defensive
operations
at
sea
if
thomas
roch
is
to
be
credited
this
fulgurator
could
shatter
the
terrestrial
spheroid
at
one
blow
and
who
knows
but
what
one
day
he
will
try
the
experiment
chapter
xii
engineer
serko
advice
thomas
roch
has
started
work
and
spends
hours
and
hours
in
a
wooden
shed
on
the
left
bank
of
the
lagoon
that
has
been
set
apart
as
his
laboratory
and
workshop
no
one
enters
it
except
himself
does
he
insist
upon
preparing
the
explosive
in
secret
and
does
he
intend
to
keep
the
formula
thereof
to
himself
i
should
not
wonder
the
manner
of
employing
roch
fulgurator
is
i
believe
very
simple
indeed
the
projectile
in
which
it
is
used
requires
neither
gun
nor
mortar
to
launch
it
nor
pneumatic
tube
like
the
zalinski
shell
it
is
autopropulsive
it
projects
itself
and
no
ship
within
a
certain
zone
when
the
engine
explodes
could
escape
utter
destruction
with
such
a
weapon
as
this
at
his
command
ker
karraje
would
be
invincible
august
to
august
during
the
past
week
thomas
roch
has
been
working
without
intermission
every
morning
the
inventor
goes
to
his
laboratory
and
does
not
issue
therefrom
till
night
i
have
made
no
attempt
to
stop
him
or
speak
to
him
knowing
that
it
would
be
useless
to
do
so
although
he
is
still
indifferent
to
everything
that
does
not
touch
upon
his
work
he
appears
to
be
perfectly
why
should
he
not
have
recovered
his
reason
has
he
not
obtained
what
he
has
so
long
sought
for
is
he
not
at
last
able
to
carry
out
the
plans
he
formed
years
and
years
ago
at
one
this
morning
i
was
roused
by
several
detonations
has
back
cup
been
attacked
was
my
first
thought
has
the
schooner
excited
suspicion
and
been
chased
to
the
entrance
to
the
passes
is
the
island
being
bombarded
with
a
view
to
its
destruction
has
justice
at
last
overtaken
these
ere
thomas
roch
has
been
able
to
complete
the
manufacture
of
his
explosive
and
before
the
autopropulsive
engine
could
be
fetched
from
the
continent
the
detonations
which
are
very
violent
continue
succeeding
each
other
at
regular
intervals
and
it
occurs
to
me
that
if
the
schooner
has
been
destroyed
all
communication
with
the
bases
of
supply
being
impossible
back
cup
can
not
be
provisioned
it
is
true
the
tug
would
be
able
to
land
the
count
somewhere
on
the
american
coast
where
money
being
no
object
he
could
easily
buy
or
order
another
vessel
but
no
matter
if
back
cup
is
only
destroyed
before
ker
karraje
has
roch
fulgurator
at
his
disposal
i
shall
render
thanks
to
heaven
a
few
hours
later
at
the
usual
time
i
quit
my
cell
all
is
quiet
at
the
beehive
the
men
are
going
about
their
business
as
usual
the
tug
is
moored
near
the
jetty
thomas
roch
is
going
to
his
laboratory
and
ker
karraje
and
engineer
serko
are
tranquilly
pacing
backwards
and
forwards
by
the
lake
and
chatting
the
island
therefore
could
not
have
been
attacked
during
the
night
yet
i
was
awakened
by
the
report
of
cannon
this
i
will
swear
at
this
moment
ker
karraje
goes
off
towards
his
abode
and
engineer
serko
smilingly
ironical
as
usual
advances
to
meet
me
well
simon
hart
he
says
are
you
getting
accustomed
to
your
tranquil
existence
do
you
appreciate
at
their
just
merit
the
advantages
of
this
enchanted
grotto
have
you
given
up
all
hope
of
recovering
your
liberty
some
day
or
other
what
is
the
use
of
waxing
wroth
with
this
jester
i
reply
calmly
no
sir
i
have
not
given
up
hope
and
i
still
expect
that
i
shall
be
released
what
hart
separate
ourselves
from
a
man
whom
we
all
esteem
and
i
from
a
colleague
who
perhaps
in
the
course
of
thomas
roch
fits
of
delirium
has
learned
some
of
his
secrets
you
are
not
serious
so
this
is
why
they
are
keeping
me
a
prisoner
in
back
cup
they
suppose
that
i
am
in
part
familiar
with
roch
invention
and
they
hope
to
force
me
to
tell
what
i
know
if
thomas
roch
refuses
to
give
up
his
secret
this
is
the
reason
why
i
was
kidnapped
with
him
and
why
i
have
not
been
accommodated
with
an
involuntary
plunge
in
the
lagoon
with
a
stone
fastened
to
my
neck
i
see
it
all
now
and
it
is
just
as
well
to
know
it
very
serious
i
affirm
in
response
to
the
last
remark
of
my
interlocutor
well
he
continues
if
i
had
the
honor
to
be
simon
hart
the
engineer
i
should
reason
as
follows
on
the
one
hand
the
personality
of
ker
karraje
the
reasons
which
incited
him
to
select
such
a
mysterious
retreat
as
this
cavern
the
necessity
of
the
said
cavern
being
kept
from
any
attempt
to
discover
it
not
only
in
the
interest
of
the
count
but
in
that
of
his
companions
of
his
accomplices
if
you
please
his
accomplices
then
on
the
other
hand
given
the
fact
that
i
know
the
real
name
of
the
count
and
in
what
mysterious
safe
he
keeps
his
riches
riches
stolen
and
stained
with
blood
mr
serko
stolen
and
stained
with
blood
if
you
like
ought
to
understand
that
this
question
of
liberty
can
not
be
settled
in
accordance
with
my
desires
it
is
useless
to
argue
the
point
under
these
conditions
and
i
switch
the
conversation
on
to
another
line
may
i
ask
i
continue
how
you
came
to
find
out
that
gaydon
the
warder
was
simon
hart
the
engineer
i
see
no
reason
for
keeping
you
in
ignorance
on
the
subject
my
dear
colleague
it
was
largely
by
hazard
we
had
certain
relations
with
the
manufactory
in
new
jersey
with
which
you
were
connected
and
which
you
quitted
suddenly
one
day
under
somewhat
singular
circumstances
well
during
a
visit
i
made
to
healthful
house
some
months
before
the
count
went
there
i
saw
and
recognized
you
you
my
very
self
and
from
that
moment
i
promised
myself
the
pleasure
of
having
you
for
a
on
board
the
i
do
not
recall
ever
having
seen
this
serko
at
healthful
house
but
what
he
says
is
very
likely
true
i
hope
your
whim
of
having
me
for
a
companion
will
cost
you
dear
some
day
or
other
i
say
to
myself
then
abruptly
i
go
on
if
i
am
not
mistaken
you
have
succeeded
in
inducing
thomas
roch
to
disclose
the
secret
of
his
fulgurator
yes
hart
we
paid
millions
for
it
but
millions
you
know
are
nothing
to
us
we
have
only
the
trouble
of
taking
them
therefore
we
filled
all
his
pockets
covered
him
with
millions
of
what
use
are
these
millions
to
him
if
he
is
not
allowed
to
enjoy
them
outside
that
hart
is
a
matter
that
does
not
trouble
him
a
little
bit
this
man
of
genius
thinks
nothing
of
the
future
he
lives
but
in
the
present
while
engines
are
being
constructed
from
his
plans
over
yonder
in
america
he
is
preparing
his
explosive
with
chemical
substances
with
which
he
has
been
abundantly
supplied
he
he
what
an
invention
it
is
this
autopropulsive
engine
which
flies
through
the
air
of
its
own
power
and
accelerates
its
speed
till
the
goal
is
reached
thanks
to
the
properties
of
a
certain
powder
of
progressive
combustion
here
we
have
an
invention
that
will
bring
about
a
radical
change
in
the
art
of
war
defensive
war
mr
serko
and
offensive
war
mr
hart
naturally
i
answer
then
pumping
him
still
more
closely
i
go
on
so
what
no
one
else
has
been
able
to
obtain
from
thomas
roch
we
obtained
without
much
difficulty
by
paying
him
by
paying
him
an
incredible
price
and
moreover
by
causing
to
vibrate
what
in
him
is
a
very
sensitive
chord
what
chord
that
of
vengeance
vengeance
against
whom
against
all
those
who
have
made
themselves
his
enemies
by
discouraging
him
by
spurning
him
expelling
him
by
constraining
him
to
go
from
country
to
country
with
an
invention
of
incontestable
superiority
now
all
notion
of
patriotism
is
extinct
in
his
soul
he
has
now
but
one
thought
one
ferocious
desire
to
avenge
himself
upon
those
who
have
denied
him
and
even
upon
all
mankind
really
hart
your
governments
of
europe
and
america
committed
a
stupendous
blunder
in
refusing
to
pay
roch
the
price
his
fulgurator
is
worth
and
engineer
serko
describes
enthusiastically
the
various
advantages
of
the
new
explosive
which
he
says
is
incontestably
superior
to
any
yet
invented
and
what
a
destructive
effect
it
has
he
adds
it
is
analogous
to
that
of
the
zalinski
shell
but
is
a
hundred
times
more
powerful
and
requires
no
machine
for
firing
it
as
it
flies
through
the
air
on
its
own
wings
so
to
speak
i
listen
in
the
hope
that
engineer
serko
will
give
away
a
part
of
the
secret
but
in
vain
he
is
careful
not
to
say
more
than
he
wants
to
has
thomas
roch
i
ask
made
you
acquainted
with
the
composition
of
his
explosive
yes
hart
if
it
is
all
the
same
to
you
and
we
shall
shortly
have
considerable
quantities
of
it
stored
in
a
safe
place
but
will
there
not
be
a
great
and
danger
in
accumulating
large
quantities
of
it
if
an
accident
were
to
happen
it
would
be
all
up
with
the
island
of
once
more
the
name
of
back
cup
was
on
the
point
of
escaping
me
they
might
consider
me
too
if
they
were
aware
that
in
addition
to
being
acquainted
with
the
count
real
name
i
also
know
where
his
stronghold
is
situated
luckily
engineer
serko
has
not
remarked
my
reticence
and
he
replies
there
will
be
no
cause
for
alarm
thomas
roch
explosive
will
not
burn
unless
subjected
to
a
special
deflagrator
neither
fire
nor
shock
will
explode
it
and
has
thomas
roch
also
sold
you
the
secret
of
his
deflagrator
not
yet
hart
but
it
will
not
be
long
before
the
bargain
is
concluded
therefore
i
repeat
no
danger
is
to
be
apprehended
and
you
need
not
keep
awake
of
nights
on
that
account
a
thousand
devils
sir
we
have
no
desire
to
be
blown
up
with
our
cavern
and
treasures
a
few
more
years
of
good
business
and
we
shall
divide
the
profits
which
will
be
large
enough
to
enable
each
one
of
us
to
live
as
he
thinks
proper
and
enjoy
life
to
the
top
of
his
bent
after
the
dissolution
of
the
firm
of
ker
karraje
and
co
i
may
add
that
though
there
is
no
danger
of
an
explosion
we
have
everything
to
fear
from
a
denunciation
which
you
are
in
the
position
to
make
hart
therefore
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
like
a
sensible
man
resign
yourself
to
the
inevitable
until
the
disbanding
of
the
company
we
shall
then
see
what
in
the
interest
of
our
security
is
best
to
be
done
with
you
it
will
be
admitted
that
these
words
are
not
exactly
calculated
to
reassure
me
however
a
lot
of
things
may
happen
ere
then
i
have
learned
one
good
thing
from
this
conversation
and
that
is
that
if
thomas
roch
has
sold
his
explosive
to
ker
karraje
and
he
has
at
any
rate
kept
the
secret
of
his
deflagrator
without
which
the
explosive
is
of
no
more
value
than
the
dust
of
the
highway
but
before
terminating
the
interview
i
think
i
ought
to
make
a
very
natural
observation
to
serko
sir
i
say
you
are
now
acquainted
with
the
composition
of
thomas
roch
explosive
does
it
really
possess
the
destructive
power
that
the
inventor
attributes
to
it
has
it
ever
been
tried
may
you
not
have
purchased
a
composition
as
inert
as
a
pinch
of
snuff
you
are
doubtless
better
informed
upon
this
point
than
you
pretend
hart
nevertheless
i
thank
you
for
the
interest
you
manifest
in
our
affairs
and
am
able
to
reassure
you
the
other
night
we
made
a
series
of
decisive
experiments
with
only
a
few
grains
of
this
substance
great
blocks
of
rock
were
reduced
to
impalpable
dust
this
explanation
evidently
applies
to
the
detonation
i
heard
thus
my
dear
colleague
continues
engineer
serko
i
can
assure
you
that
our
expectations
have
been
answered
the
effects
of
the
explosive
surpass
anything
that
could
have
been
imagined
a
few
thousand
tons
of
it
would
burst
our
spheroid
and
scatter
the
fragments
into
space
you
can
be
absolutely
certain
that
it
is
capable
of
destroying
no
matter
what
vessel
at
a
distance
considerably
greater
than
that
attained
by
present
projectiles
and
within
a
zone
of
at
least
a
mile
the
weak
point
in
the
invention
is
that
rather
too
much
time
has
to
be
expended
in
regulating
the
firing
engineer
serko
stops
short
as
though
reluctant
to
give
any
further
information
but
finally
adds
therefore
i
end
as
i
began
hart
resign
yourself
to
the
inevitable
accept
your
new
existence
without
reserve
give
yourself
up
to
the
tranquil
delights
of
this
subterranean
life
if
one
is
in
good
health
one
preserves
it
if
one
has
lost
one
health
one
recovers
it
here
that
is
what
is
happening
to
your
fellow
countryman
yes
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
resign
yourself
to
your
lot
thereupon
this
giver
of
good
advice
leaves
me
after
saluting
me
with
a
friendly
gesture
like
a
man
whose
good
intentions
merit
appreciation
but
what
irony
there
is
in
his
words
in
his
glance
in
his
attitude
shall
i
ever
be
able
to
get
even
with
him
i
now
know
that
at
any
rate
it
is
not
easy
to
regulate
the
aim
of
roch
engine
it
is
probable
that
it
always
bursts
at
the
same
distance
and
that
beyond
the
zone
in
which
the
effects
of
the
fulgurator
are
so
terrible
and
once
it
has
been
passed
a
ship
is
safe
from
its
effects
if
i
could
only
inform
the
world
of
this
vital
fact
for
two
days
no
incident
worth
recording
has
occurred
i
have
explored
back
cup
to
its
extreme
limits
at
night
when
the
long
perspective
of
arched
columns
are
illuminated
by
the
electric
lamps
i
am
almost
religiously
impressed
when
i
gaze
upon
the
natural
wonders
of
this
cavern
which
has
become
my
prison
i
have
never
given
up
hope
of
finding
somewhere
in
the
walls
a
fissure
of
some
kind
of
which
the
pirates
are
ignorant
and
through
which
i
could
make
my
escape
it
is
true
that
once
outside
i
should
have
to
wait
till
a
passing
ship
hove
in
sight
my
evasion
would
speedily
be
known
at
the
beehive
and
i
should
soon
be
recaptured
unless
a
happy
thought
strikes
me
unless
i
could
get
at
the
boat
that
was
drawn
up
high
and
dry
on
the
little
sandy
beach
in
the
creek
in
this
i
might
be
able
to
make
my
way
to
george
or
hamilton
this
evening
it
was
about
nine
i
stretched
myself
on
a
bed
of
sand
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
columns
about
one
hundred
yards
to
the
east
of
the
lagoon
shortly
afterwards
i
heard
footsteps
then
voices
hiding
myself
as
best
i
could
behind
the
rocky
base
of
the
pillar
i
listened
with
all
my
ears
i
recognized
the
voices
as
those
of
ker
karraje
and
engineer
serko
the
two
men
stopped
close
to
where
i
was
lying
and
continued
their
conversation
in
english
which
is
the
language
generally
used
in
back
cup
i
was
therefore
able
to
understand
all
that
they
said
they
were
talking
about
thomas
roch
or
rather
his
fulgurator
in
a
week
time
said
ker
karraje
i
shall
put
to
sea
in
the
and
fetch
the
sections
of
the
engines
that
are
being
cast
in
that
virginian
foundry
and
when
they
are
here
observed
engineer
serko
i
will
piece
them
together
and
fix
up
the
frames
for
firing
them
but
beforehand
there
is
a
job
to
be
done
which
it
seems
to
me
is
indispensable
what
is
that
to
cut
a
tunnel
through
the
wall
of
the
cavern
through
the
wall
of
the
cavern
oh
nothing
but
a
narrow
passage
through
which
only
one
man
at
a
time
could
squeeze
a
hole
easy
enough
to
block
and
the
outside
end
of
which
would
be
hidden
among
the
rocks
of
what
use
could
it
be
to
us
serko
i
have
often
thought
about
the
utility
of
having
some
other
way
of
getting
out
besides
the
submarine
tunnel
we
never
know
what
the
future
may
have
in
store
for
us
but
the
walls
are
so
thick
and
hard
objected
ker
karraje
oh
with
a
few
grains
of
roch
explosive
i
undertake
to
reduce
the
rock
to
such
fine
powder
that
we
shall
be
able
to
blow
it
away
with
our
breath
serko
replied
it
can
easily
be
imagined
with
what
interest
and
eagerness
i
listened
to
this
here
was
a
ray
of
hope
it
was
proposed
to
open
up
communication
with
the
outside
by
a
tunnel
in
the
wall
and
this
held
out
the
possibility
of
escape
as
this
thought
flashed
through
my
mind
ker
karraje
said
very
well
serko
and
if
it
becomes
necessary
some
day
to
defend
back
cup
and
prevent
any
ship
from
approaching
it
it
is
true
he
went
on
without
finishing
the
reflection
our
retreat
would
have
to
have
been
discovered
by
accident
or
by
denunciation
we
have
nothing
to
fear
either
from
accident
or
denunciation
affirmed
serko
by
one
of
our
band
no
of
course
not
but
by
simon
hart
perhaps
hart
exclaimed
serko
he
would
have
to
escape
first
and
no
one
can
escape
from
back
cup
i
am
by
the
bye
interested
in
this
hart
he
is
a
colleague
after
all
and
i
have
always
suspected
that
he
knows
more
about
roch
invention
than
he
pretends
i
will
get
round
him
so
that
we
shall
soon
be
discussing
physics
mechanics
and
matters
ballistic
like
a
couple
of
friends
no
matter
replied
the
generous
and
sensible
count
when
we
are
in
full
possession
of
the
secret
we
had
better
get
rid
of
the
fellow
we
have
plenty
of
time
to
do
that
ker
karraje
if
god
permits
you
to
you
wretches
i
muttered
to
myself
while
my
heart
thumped
against
my
ribs
and
yet
without
the
intervention
of
providence
what
hope
is
there
for
me
the
conversation
then
took
another
direction
now
that
we
know
the
composition
of
the
explosive
serko
said
ker
karraje
we
must
at
all
cost
get
that
of
the
deflagrator
from
thomas
roch
yes
replied
engineer
serko
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
do
unfortunately
however
roch
positively
refuses
to
discuss
it
still
he
has
already
made
a
few
drops
of
it
with
which
those
experiments
were
made
and
he
will
furnish
as
with
some
more
to
blow
a
hole
through
the
wall
but
what
about
our
expeditions
at
sea
queried
ker
karraje
patience
we
shall
end
by
getting
roch
thunderbolts
entirely
in
our
own
hand
and
then
are
you
sure
serko
quite
sure
by
paying
the
price
ker
karraje
the
conversation
dropped
at
this
point
and
they
strolled
off
without
having
seen
me
very
luckily
for
me
i
guess
if
engineer
serko
spoke
up
somewhat
in
defence
of
a
colleague
ker
karraje
is
apparently
animated
with
much
less
benevolent
sentiments
in
regard
to
me
on
the
least
suspicion
they
would
throw
me
into
the
lake
and
if
i
ever
got
through
the
tunnel
it
would
only
be
as
a
corpse
carried
out
by
the
ebbing
tide
engineer
serko
has
been
prospecting
with
a
view
to
piercing
the
proposed
passage
through
the
wall
in
such
a
way
that
its
existence
will
never
be
dreamed
of
outside
after
a
minute
examination
he
decided
to
tunnel
through
the
northern
end
of
the
cavern
about
sixty
feet
from
the
first
cells
of
the
beehive
i
am
anxious
for
the
passage
to
be
made
for
who
knows
but
what
it
may
be
the
way
to
freedom
for
me
ah
if
i
only
knew
how
to
swim
perhaps
i
should
have
attempted
to
escape
through
the
submarine
tunnel
as
since
it
was
disclosed
by
the
lashing
back
of
the
waters
by
the
whale
in
its
i
know
exactly
where
the
orifice
is
situated
it
seems
to
me
that
at
the
time
of
the
great
tides
this
orifice
must
be
partly
uncovered
at
the
full
and
new
moon
when
the
sea
attains
its
maximum
depression
below
the
normal
level
it
is
possible
that
i
must
satisfy
myself
about
this
i
do
not
know
how
the
fact
will
help
me
in
any
way
even
if
the
entrance
to
the
tunnel
is
partly
uncovered
but
i
can
not
afford
to
miss
any
detail
that
may
possibly
aid
in
my
escape
from
back
cup
this
morning
i
am
witnessing
the
departure
of
the
tug
the
count
is
no
doubt
going
off
in
the
to
fetch
the
sections
of
thomas
roch
engines
before
embarking
the
count
converses
long
and
earnestly
with
engineer
serko
who
apparently
is
not
going
to
accompany
him
on
this
trip
and
is
evidently
giving
him
some
recommendations
of
which
i
may
be
the
object
then
having
stepped
on
to
the
platform
he
goes
below
the
lid
shuts
with
a
bang
and
the
tug
sinks
out
of
sight
leaving
a
trail
of
bubbles
behind
it
the
hours
go
by
night
is
coming
on
yet
the
tug
does
not
return
i
conclude
that
it
has
gone
to
tow
the
schooner
and
perhaps
to
destroy
any
merchant
vessels
that
may
come
in
their
way
it
can
not
however
be
absent
very
long
as
the
trip
to
america
and
back
will
not
take
more
than
a
week
besides
if
i
can
judge
from
the
calm
atmosphere
in
the
interior
of
the
cavern
the
must
be
favored
with
beautiful
weather
this
is
in
fact
the
fine
season
in
this
part
of
the
world
ah
if
only
i
could
break
out
of
my
prison
chapter
xiii
god
be
with
it
august
to
september
thirteen
days
have
gone
by
and
the
has
not
returned
did
she
then
not
make
straight
for
the
american
coast
has
she
been
delayed
by
a
buccaneering
cruise
in
the
neighborhood
of
back
cup
it
seems
to
me
that
ker
karraje
only
desire
would
be
to
get
back
with
the
sections
of
roch
engines
as
soon
as
possible
maybe
the
virginian
foundry
had
not
quite
finished
them
engineer
serko
does
not
display
the
least
anxiety
or
impatience
he
continues
to
greet
me
with
his
accustomed
ironical
cordiality
and
with
a
kindly
air
that
i
distrust
with
good
reason
he
affects
to
be
solicitous
as
to
my
health
urges
me
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
job
calls
me
ali
baba
assures
me
that
there
is
not
in
the
whole
world
such
an
enchanting
spot
as
this
arabian
nights
cavern
observes
that
i
am
fed
warmed
lodged
and
clothed
that
i
have
no
taxes
to
pay
and
that
even
the
inhabitants
of
the
favored
principality
of
monaco
do
not
enjoy
an
existence
more
free
from
care
sometimes
this
ironical
verbiage
brings
the
blood
to
my
face
and
i
am
tempted
to
seize
this
cynical
banterer
by
the
throat
and
choke
the
life
out
of
him
they
would
kill
me
afterwards
still
what
would
that
matter
would
it
not
be
better
to
end
in
this
way
than
to
spend
years
and
years
amid
these
infernal
and
infamous
surroundings
however
while
there
is
life
there
is
hope
i
reflect
and
this
thought
restrains
me
i
have
scarcely
set
eyes
upon
thomas
roch
since
the
went
away
he
shuts
himself
up
in
his
laboratory
and
works
unceasingly
if
he
utilizes
all
the
substances
placed
at
his
disposition
there
will
be
enough
to
blow
up
back
cup
and
the
whole
bermudan
archipelago
with
it
i
cling
to
the
hope
that
he
will
never
consent
to
give
up
the
secret
of
his
deflagrator
and
that
engineer
serko
efforts
to
acquire
it
will
remain
futile
i
have
been
able
to
witness
with
my
own
eyes
the
power
of
roch
explosive
and
also
the
manner
in
which
the
fulgurator
is
employed
during
the
morning
the
men
began
to
pierce
the
passage
through
the
wall
of
the
cavern
at
the
spot
fixed
upon
by
engineer
serko
who
superintended
the
work
in
person
the
work
began
at
the
base
where
the
rock
is
as
hard
as
granite
to
have
continued
it
with
pickaxes
would
have
entailed
long
and
arduous
labor
inasmuch
as
the
wall
at
this
place
is
not
less
than
from
twenty
to
thirty
yards
in
thickness
but
thanks
to
roch
fulgurator
the
passage
will
be
completed
easily
and
rapidly
i
may
well
be
astonished
at
what
i
have
seen
the
pickaxes
hardly
made
any
impression
on
the
rock
but
its
disaggregation
was
effected
with
really
remarkable
facility
by
means
of
the
fulgurator
a
few
grains
of
this
explosive
shattered
the
rocky
mass
and
reduced
it
to
almost
impalpable
powder
that
one
breath
could
disperse
as
easily
as
vapor
the
explosion
produced
an
excavation
measuring
fully
a
cubic
yard
it
was
accompanied
by
a
sharp
detonation
that
may
be
compared
to
the
report
of
a
cannon
the
first
charge
used
although
a
very
small
one
a
mere
pinch
blew
the
men
in
every
direction
and
two
of
them
were
seriously
injured
engineer
serko
himself
was
projected
several
yards
and
sustained
some
rather
severe
contusions
here
is
how
this
substance
whose
bursting
force
surpasses
anything
hitherto
conceived
is
employed
a
small
hole
about
an
inch
and
a
half
in
length
is
pierced
obliquely
in
the
rock
a
few
grains
of
the
explosive
are
then
inserted
but
no
wad
is
used
then
thomas
roch
steps
forward
in
his
hand
is
a
little
glass
phial
containing
a
bluish
oily
liquid
that
congeals
almost
as
soon
as
it
comes
in
contact
with
the
air
he
pours
one
drop
on
the
entrance
of
the
hole
and
draws
back
but
not
with
undue
haste
it
takes
a
certain
time
about
seconds
i
reckon
before
the
combination
of
the
fulgurator
and
deflagrator
is
effected
but
when
the
explosion
does
take
place
its
power
of
disaggregation
is
such
i
repeat
that
it
may
be
regarded
as
unlimited
it
is
at
any
rate
a
thousand
times
superior
to
that
of
any
known
explosive
under
these
circumstances
it
will
probably
not
take
more
than
a
week
to
complete
the
tunnel
for
some
time
past
i
have
observed
that
the
tide
rises
and
falls
twice
every
hours
and
that
the
ebb
and
flow
produce
a
rather
swift
current
through
the
submarine
tunnel
it
is
pretty
certain
therefore
that
a
floating
object
thrown
into
the
lagoon
when
the
top
of
the
orifice
is
uncovered
would
be
carried
out
by
the
receding
tide
it
is
just
possible
that
during
the
lowest
equinoctial
tides
the
top
of
the
orifice
is
uncovered
this
i
shall
be
able
to
ascertain
as
this
is
precisely
the
time
they
occur
september
i
could
almost
distinguish
the
summit
of
the
hole
under
the
water
the
day
after
if
ever
it
will
be
uncovered
very
well
then
if
i
can
not
myself
attempt
to
get
through
may
be
a
bottle
thrown
into
the
lagoon
might
be
carried
out
during
the
last
few
minutes
of
the
ebb
and
might
not
this
bottle
by
chance
an
chance
i
must
avow
be
picked
up
by
a
ship
passing
near
back
cup
perhaps
even
it
might
be
borne
away
by
a
friendly
current
and
cast
upon
one
of
the
bermudan
beaches
what
if
that
bottle
contained
a
letter
i
can
not
get
this
thought
out
of
my
mind
and
it
works
me
up
into
a
great
state
of
excitement
then
objections
crop
up
this
one
among
others
the
bottle
might
be
swept
against
the
rocks
and
smashed
ere
ever
it
could
get
out
of
the
tunnel
very
true
but
what
if
instead
of
a
bottle
a
diminutive
tightly
closed
keg
were
used
it
would
not
run
any
danger
of
being
smashed
and
would
besides
stand
a
much
better
chance
of
reaching
the
open
sea
this
evening
i
unperceived
entered
one
of
the
store
houses
containing
the
booty
pillaged
from
various
ships
and
procured
a
keg
very
suitable
for
my
experiment
i
hid
the
keg
under
my
coat
and
returned
to
the
beehive
and
my
cell
then
without
losing
an
instant
i
set
to
work
paper
pen
ink
nothing
was
wanting
as
will
be
supposed
from
the
fact
that
for
three
months
i
have
been
making
notes
and
dotting
down
my
impressions
daily
i
indite
the
following
message
on
june
last
thomas
roch
and
his
keeper
gaydon
or
rather
simon
hart
the
french
engineer
who
occupied
pavilion
no
at
healthful
house
near
north
carolina
united
states
of
america
were
kidnapped
and
carried
on
board
the
schooner
belonging
to
the
count
both
are
now
confined
in
the
interior
of
a
cavern
which
serves
as
a
lair
for
the
said
count
who
is
really
ker
karraje
the
pirate
who
some
time
ago
carried
on
his
depredations
in
the
west
pacific
and
for
about
a
hundred
men
of
which
his
band
is
composed
when
he
has
obtained
possession
of
roch
fulgurator
whose
power
is
so
to
speak
without
limit
ker
karraje
will
be
in
a
position
to
carry
on
his
crimes
with
complete
impunity
it
is
therefore
urgent
that
the
states
interested
should
destroy
his
lair
without
delay
the
cavern
in
which
the
pirate
ker
karraje
has
taken
refuge
is
in
the
interior
of
the
islet
of
back
cup
which
is
wrongly
regarded
as
an
active
volcano
it
is
situated
at
the
western
extremity
of
the
archipelago
of
bermuda
and
on
the
east
is
bounded
by
a
range
of
reefs
but
on
the
north
south
and
west
is
open
communication
with
the
inside
of
the
mountain
is
only
possible
through
a
tunnel
a
few
yards
under
water
in
a
narrow
pass
on
the
west
a
submarine
apparatus
therefore
is
necessary
to
effect
an
entrance
at
any
rate
until
a
tunnel
they
are
boring
through
the
northwestern
wall
of
the
cavern
is
completed
the
pirate
ker
karraje
employs
an
apparatus
of
this
kind
the
submarine
boat
that
the
count
ordered
of
the
cramps
and
which
was
supposed
to
have
been
lost
during
the
public
experiment
with
it
in
charleston
bay
this
boat
is
used
not
only
for
the
purpose
of
entering
and
issuing
from
back
cup
but
also
to
tow
the
schooner
and
attack
merchant
vessels
in
bermudan
waters
this
schooner
so
well
known
on
the
american
coast
is
kept
in
a
small
creek
on
the
western
side
of
the
island
behind
a
mass
of
rocks
and
is
invisible
from
the
sea
the
best
place
to
land
is
on
the
west
coast
formerly
occupied
by
the
colony
of
bermudan
fishers
but
it
would
first
be
advisable
to
effect
a
breach
in
the
side
of
the
cavern
by
means
of
the
most
powerful
melinite
shells
the
fact
that
ker
karraje
may
be
in
the
position
to
use
fulgurator
for
the
defence
of
the
island
must
also
be
taken
into
consideration
let
it
be
well
borne
in
mind
that
if
its
destructive
power
surpasses
anything
ever
conceived
or
dreamed
of
it
extends
over
a
zone
not
exceeding
a
mile
in
extent
the
distance
of
this
dangerous
zone
is
variable
but
once
the
engines
have
been
set
the
modification
of
the
distance
occupies
some
time
and
a
warship
that
succeeds
in
passing
the
zone
has
nothing
further
to
fear
this
document
is
written
on
the
twentieth
day
of
september
at
eight
in
the
evening
and
is
signed
with
my
name
thomas
hart
engineer
the
above
is
the
text
of
the
statement
i
have
just
drawn
up
it
says
all
that
is
necessary
about
the
island
whose
exact
situation
is
marked
on
all
modern
charts
and
maps
and
points
out
the
expediency
of
acting
without
delay
and
what
to
do
in
case
ker
karraje
is
in
the
position
to
employ
roch
fulgurator
i
add
a
plan
of
the
cavern
showing
its
internal
configuration
the
situation
of
the
lagoon
the
lay
of
the
beehive
ker
habitation
my
cell
and
thomas
roch
laboratory
i
wrap
the
document
in
a
piece
of
tarpaulin
and
insert
the
package
in
the
little
keg
which
measures
six
inches
by
three
and
a
half
it
is
perfectly
watertight
and
will
stand
any
amount
of
knocking
about
against
the
rocks
there
is
one
danger
however
and
that
is
that
it
may
be
swept
back
by
the
returning
tide
cast
up
on
the
island
and
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
crew
of
the
when
the
schooner
is
hauled
into
her
creek
if
ker
karraje
ever
gets
hold
of
it
it
will
be
all
up
with
me
it
will
be
readily
conceived
with
what
anxiety
i
have
awaited
the
moment
to
make
the
attempt
i
am
in
a
perfect
fever
of
excitement
for
it
is
a
matter
of
life
or
death
to
me
i
calculate
from
previous
observations
that
the
tide
will
be
very
low
at
about
a
quarter
to
nine
the
top
of
the
tunnel
ought
then
to
be
a
foot
and
a
half
above
water
which
is
more
than
enough
to
permit
of
the
keg
passing
through
it
it
will
be
another
half
hour
at
least
before
the
flow
sets
in
again
and
by
that
time
the
keg
may
be
far
enough
away
to
escape
being
thrown
back
on
the
coast
i
peer
out
of
my
cell
there
is
no
one
about
and
i
advance
to
the
side
of
the
lagoon
where
by
the
light
of
a
nearby
lamp
i
perceive
the
arch
of
the
tunnel
towards
which
the
current
seems
to
be
setting
pretty
swiftly
i
go
down
to
the
very
edge
and
cast
in
the
keg
which
contains
the
precious
document
and
all
my
hopes
god
be
with
it
i
fervently
exclaim
god
be
with
it
for
a
minute
or
two
the
little
barrel
remains
stationary
and
then
floats
back
to
the
side
again
i
throw
it
out
once
more
with
all
my
strength
this
time
it
is
in
the
track
of
the
current
which
to
my
great
joy
sweeps
it
along
and
in
twenty
seconds
it
has
disappeared
in
the
tunnel
yes
god
be
with
it
may
heaven
guide
thee
little
barrel
may
it
protect
all
those
whom
ker
karraje
menaces
and
grant
that
this
band
of
pirates
may
not
escape
from
the
justice
of
man
chapter
xiv
battle
between
the
sword
and
the
tug
through
all
this
sleepless
night
i
have
followed
the
keg
in
fancy
how
many
times
i
seem
to
see
it
swept
against
the
rocks
in
the
tunnel
into
a
creek
or
some
excavation
i
am
in
a
cold
perspiration
from
head
to
foot
then
i
imagine
that
it
has
been
carried
out
to
sea
heavens
if
the
returning
tide
should
sweep
it
back
to
the
entrance
and
then
through
the
tunnel
into
the
lagoon
i
must
be
on
the
lookout
for
it
i
rise
before
the
sun
and
saunter
down
to
the
lagoon
not
a
single
object
is
floating
on
its
calm
surface
the
work
on
the
tunnel
through
the
side
of
the
cavern
goes
on
and
at
four
in
the
afternoon
on
september
engineer
serko
blows
away
the
last
rock
obstructing
the
issue
and
communication
with
the
outer
world
is
established
it
is
only
a
very
narrow
hole
and
one
has
to
stoop
to
go
through
it
the
exterior
orifice
is
lost
among
the
crannies
of
the
rocky
coast
and
it
would
be
easy
to
obstruct
it
if
such
a
measure
became
necessary
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
passage
will
be
strictly
guarded
no
one
without
special
authorization
will
be
able
either
to
go
out
or
come
in
therefore
there
is
little
hope
of
escape
in
that
direction
this
morning
the
tug
rose
from
the
depth
of
the
lagoon
to
the
surface
and
has
now
run
alongside
the
jetty
the
count
and
captain
spade
disembark
and
the
crew
set
to
work
to
land
the
provisions
boxes
of
canned
meat
preserves
barrels
of
wine
and
spirits
and
other
things
brought
by
the
among
which
are
several
packages
destined
for
thomas
roch
the
men
also
land
the
various
sections
of
roch
engines
which
are
discoid
in
shape
the
inventor
watches
their
operations
and
his
eyes
glisten
with
eagerness
he
seizes
one
of
the
sections
examines
it
and
nods
approval
i
notice
that
his
joy
no
longer
finds
expression
in
incoherent
utterances
that
he
is
completely
transformed
from
what
he
was
while
a
patient
at
healthful
house
so
much
is
this
the
case
that
i
begin
to
ask
myself
whether
his
madness
which
was
asserted
to
be
incurable
has
not
been
radically
cured
at
last
thomas
roch
embarks
in
the
boat
used
for
crossing
the
lake
and
is
rowed
over
to
his
laboratory
engineer
serko
accompanies
him
in
an
hour
time
the
tug
cargo
has
all
been
taken
out
and
transported
to
the
storehouses
ker
karraje
exchanges
a
word
or
two
with
engineer
serko
and
then
enters
his
mansion
later
in
the
afternoon
i
see
them
walking
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
beehive
and
talking
earnestly
together
then
they
enter
the
new
tunnel
followed
by
captain
spade
if
i
could
but
follow
them
if
i
could
but
breathe
for
awhile
the
bracing
air
of
the
atlantic
of
which
the
interior
of
back
cup
only
receives
attenuated
puffs
so
to
speak
september
to
october
fifteen
days
have
elapsed
under
the
directions
of
engineer
serko
and
thomas
roch
the
sections
of
the
engines
have
been
fitted
together
then
the
construction
of
their
supports
is
begun
these
supports
are
simple
trestles
fitted
with
transverse
troughs
or
grooves
of
various
degrees
of
inclination
and
which
could
be
easily
installed
on
the
deck
of
the
or
even
on
the
platform
of
the
tug
which
can
be
kept
on
a
level
with
the
surface
thus
ker
karraje
will
be
ruler
of
the
seas
with
his
yacht
no
warship
however
big
however
powerful
will
be
able
to
cross
the
zone
of
danger
whereas
the
will
be
out
of
range
of
its
guns
if
only
my
notice
were
found
if
only
the
existence
of
this
lair
of
back
cup
were
known
means
would
soon
be
found
if
not
of
destroying
the
place
at
least
of
starving
the
band
into
submission
to
my
extreme
surprise
i
find
this
morning
that
the
tug
has
gone
away
again
i
recall
that
yesterday
the
elements
of
the
piles
were
renewed
but
i
thought
it
was
only
to
keep
them
in
order
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
outside
can
now
be
reached
through
the
new
tunnel
and
that
thomas
roch
has
everything
he
requires
i
can
only
conclude
that
the
tug
has
gone
off
on
another
marauding
expedition
yet
this
is
the
season
of
the
equinoctial
gales
and
the
bermudan
waters
are
swept
by
frequent
tempests
this
is
evident
from
the
violent
gusts
that
drive
back
the
smoke
through
the
crater
and
the
heavy
rain
that
accompanies
it
as
well
as
by
the
water
in
the
lagoon
which
swells
and
washes
over
the
brown
rocks
on
its
shores
but
it
is
by
no
means
sure
that
the
has
quitted
her
cove
however
staunch
she
may
be
she
is
it
seems
to
me
of
too
light
a
build
to
face
such
tempests
as
now
rage
even
with
the
help
of
the
tug
on
the
other
hand
although
the
tug
has
nothing
to
fear
from
the
heavy
seas
as
it
would
be
in
calm
water
a
few
yards
below
the
surface
it
is
hardly
likely
that
it
has
gone
on
a
trip
unless
to
accompany
the
schooner
i
do
not
know
to
what
its
departure
can
be
attributed
but
its
absence
is
likely
to
be
prolonged
for
it
has
not
yet
returned
engineer
serko
has
remained
behind
but
ker
karraje
captain
spade
and
the
crew
of
the
schooner
i
find
have
left
life
in
the
cavern
goes
on
with
its
usual
dispiriting
monotony
i
pass
hour
after
hour
in
my
cell
meditating
hoping
despairing
following
in
fancy
the
voyage
of
my
little
barrel
tossed
about
at
the
mercy
of
the
currents
and
whose
chances
of
being
picked
up
i
fear
are
becoming
fainter
each
day
and
killing
time
by
writing
my
diary
which
will
probably
not
survive
me
thomas
roch
is
constantly
occupied
in
his
laboratory
manufacturing
his
deflagrator
i
still
entertain
the
conviction
that
nothing
will
ever
induce
him
to
give
up
the
secret
of
the
liquid
composition
but
i
am
perfectly
aware
that
he
will
not
hesitate
to
place
his
invention
at
ker
karraje
service
i
often
meet
engineer
serko
when
my
strolls
take
me
in
the
direction
of
the
beehive
he
always
shows
himself
disposed
to
chat
with
me
though
it
is
true
he
does
so
in
a
tone
of
impertinent
frivolity
we
converse
upon
all
sorts
of
subjects
but
rarely
of
my
position
recrimination
thereanent
is
useless
and
only
subjects
me
to
renewed
bantering
i
asked
engineer
serko
whether
the
had
put
to
sea
again
with
the
tug
yes
simon
hart
he
replied
and
though
the
clouds
gather
and
loud
the
tempest
roars
be
in
no
uneasiness
in
regard
to
our
dear
will
she
be
gone
long
we
expect
her
back
within
hours
it
is
the
last
voyage
count
proposes
to
make
before
the
winter
gales
render
navigation
in
these
parts
impracticable
is
her
voyage
one
of
business
or
pleasure
of
business
hart
of
business
answered
engineer
serko
with
a
smile
our
engines
are
now
completed
and
when
the
fine
weather
returns
we
shall
resume
offensive
operations
against
unfortunate
merchantmen
as
unfortunate
as
they
are
richly
laden
acts
of
piracy
whose
impunity
will
i
trust
not
always
be
assured
i
calm
yourself
dear
colleague
be
calm
be
calm
no
one
you
know
can
ever
discover
our
retreat
and
none
can
ever
disclose
the
secret
besides
with
these
engines
which
are
so
easily
handled
and
are
of
such
terrible
power
it
would
be
easy
for
us
to
blow
to
pieces
any
ship
that
attempted
to
get
within
a
certain
radius
of
the
island
providing
i
said
that
thomas
roch
has
sold
you
the
composition
of
his
deflagrator
as
he
has
sold
you
that
of
his
fulgurator
that
he
has
done
hart
and
it
behooves
me
to
set
your
mind
at
rest
upon
that
point
from
this
categorical
response
i
ought
to
have
concluded
that
the
misfortune
had
been
consummated
but
a
certain
hesitation
in
the
intonation
of
his
voice
warned
me
that
implicit
reliance
was
not
to
be
placed
upon
engineer
serko
assertions
what
a
frightful
adventure
i
have
just
been
mixed
up
in
and
what
a
wonder
i
did
not
lose
my
life
it
is
only
by
a
miracle
that
i
am
able
to
resume
these
notes
which
have
been
interrupted
for
hours
with
a
little
luck
i
should
have
been
delivered
i
should
now
be
in
one
of
the
bermudan
ports
george
or
hamilton
the
mysteries
of
back
cup
would
have
been
cleared
up
the
description
of
the
schooner
would
have
been
wired
all
over
the
world
and
she
would
not
dare
to
put
into
any
port
the
provisioning
of
back
cup
would
be
impossible
and
ker
karraje
bandits
would
be
condemned
to
starve
to
death
this
is
what
occurred
at
eight
in
the
evening
on
october
i
quitted
my
cell
in
an
indefinable
state
of
nervousness
and
with
a
presentiment
that
a
serious
event
was
imminent
in
vain
i
had
tried
to
seek
calmness
in
sleep
it
was
impossible
to
do
so
and
i
rose
and
went
out
outside
back
cup
the
weather
must
have
been
very
rough
violent
gusts
of
wind
swept
in
through
the
crater
and
agitated
the
water
of
the
lagoon
i
walked
along
the
shore
on
the
beehive
side
no
one
was
about
it
was
rather
cold
and
the
air
was
damp
the
pirates
were
all
snugly
ensconced
in
their
cells
with
the
exception
of
one
man
who
stood
guard
over
the
new
passage
notwithstanding
that
the
outer
entrance
had
been
blocked
from
where
he
was
this
man
could
not
see
the
lagoon
moreover
there
were
only
two
lamps
alight
one
on
each
side
of
the
lake
and
the
forest
of
pillars
was
wrapt
in
the
profoundest
obscurity
i
was
walking
about
in
the
shadow
when
some
one
passed
me
i
saw
that
he
was
thomas
roch
he
was
walking
slowly
absorbed
by
his
thoughts
his
brain
at
work
as
usual
was
this
not
a
favorable
opportunity
to
talk
to
him
to
enlighten
him
about
what
he
was
probably
ignorant
namely
the
character
of
the
people
into
whose
hands
he
had
fallen
he
can
not
i
argued
know
that
the
count
is
none
other
than
ker
karraje
the
pirate
he
can
not
be
aware
that
he
has
given
up
a
part
of
his
invention
to
such
a
bandit
i
must
open
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
he
will
never
be
able
to
enjoy
his
millions
that
he
is
a
prisoner
in
back
cup
and
will
never
be
allowed
to
leave
it
any
more
than
i
shall
yes
i
will
make
an
appeal
to
his
sentiments
of
humanity
and
point
out
to
him
what
frightful
misfortunes
he
will
be
responsible
for
if
he
does
not
keep
the
secret
of
his
deflagrator
all
this
i
had
said
to
myself
and
was
preparing
to
carry
out
my
resolution
when
i
suddenly
felt
myself
seized
from
behind
two
men
held
me
by
the
arms
and
another
appeared
in
front
of
me
before
i
had
time
to
cry
out
the
man
exclaimed
in
english
hush
not
a
word
are
you
not
simon
hart
yes
how
did
you
know
i
saw
you
come
out
of
your
cell
who
are
you
then
lieutenant
davon
of
the
british
navy
of
which
is
stationed
at
the
bermudas
emotion
choked
me
so
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
utter
a
word
we
have
come
to
rescue
you
from
ker
karraje
and
also
propose
to
carry
off
thomas
roch
he
added
thomas
roch
i
stammered
yes
the
document
signed
by
you
was
found
on
the
beach
at
george
in
a
keg
lieutenant
davon
which
i
committed
to
the
waters
of
the
lagoon
and
which
contained
went
on
the
officer
the
notice
by
which
we
were
apprised
that
the
island
of
back
cup
served
as
a
refuge
for
ker
karraje
and
his
band
ker
karraje
this
false
count
the
author
of
the
double
abduction
from
healthful
house
ah
lieutenant
davon
now
we
have
not
a
moment
to
spare
we
must
profit
by
the
obscurity
one
word
lieutenant
davon
how
did
you
penetrate
to
the
interior
of
back
cup
by
means
of
the
submarine
boat
with
which
we
have
been
making
experiments
at
george
for
six
months
past
a
submarine
boat
yes
it
awaits
us
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
and
now
hart
where
is
ker
karraje
tug
it
has
been
away
for
three
weeks
ker
karraje
is
not
here
then
no
but
we
expect
him
back
every
day
every
hour
i
might
say
it
matters
little
replied
lieutenant
davon
it
is
not
after
ker
karraje
but
thomas
roch
we
have
come
and
you
also
hart
the
will
not
leave
the
lagoon
till
you
are
both
on
board
if
she
does
not
turn
up
at
george
again
they
will
know
that
i
have
failed
and
they
will
try
again
where
is
the
lieutenant
on
this
side
in
the
shadow
of
the
bank
where
it
can
not
be
seen
thanks
to
your
directions
i
and
my
crew
were
able
to
locate
the
tunnel
we
came
through
all
right
and
ten
minutes
ago
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
lake
two
men
landed
with
me
i
saw
you
issue
from
the
cell
marked
on
your
plan
do
you
know
where
thomas
roch
is
a
few
paces
off
he
has
just
passed
me
on
his
way
to
his
laboratory
god
be
praised
mr
hart
amen
lieutenant
davon
the
lieutenant
the
two
men
and
i
took
the
path
around
the
lagoon
we
had
not
gone
far
when
we
perceived
thomas
roch
in
front
of
us
to
throw
ourselves
upon
him
gag
him
before
he
could
utter
a
cry
bind
him
before
he
could
offer
any
resistance
and
bear
him
off
to
the
place
where
the
was
moored
was
the
work
of
a
minute
the
was
a
submersible
boat
of
only
twelve
tons
and
consequently
much
inferior
to
the
tug
both
in
respect
of
dimensions
and
power
her
screw
was
worked
by
a
couple
of
dynamos
fitted
with
accumulators
that
had
been
charged
twelve
hours
previously
in
the
port
of
george
however
the
would
suffice
to
take
us
out
of
this
prison
to
restore
us
to
liberty
that
liberty
of
which
i
had
given
up
all
hope
thomas
roch
was
at
last
to
be
rescued
from
the
clutches
of
ker
karraje
and
engineer
serko
the
rascals
would
not
be
able
to
utilize
his
invention
and
nothing
could
prevent
the
warships
from
landing
a
storming
party
on
the
island
who
would
force
the
tunnel
in
the
wall
and
secure
the
pirates
we
saw
no
one
while
the
two
men
were
conveying
thomas
roch
to
the
and
all
got
on
board
without
incident
the
lid
was
shut
and
secured
the
water
compartments
filled
and
the
sank
out
of
sight
we
were
saved
the
was
divided
into
three
compartments
the
after
one
contained
the
accumulators
and
machinery
the
middle
one
occupied
by
the
pilot
was
surmounted
by
a
periscope
fitted
with
lenticular
portholes
through
which
an
electric
lighted
the
way
through
the
water
forward
in
the
other
compartment
thomas
roch
and
i
were
shut
in
my
companion
though
the
gag
which
was
choking
him
had
been
removed
was
still
bound
and
i
thought
knew
what
was
going
on
but
we
were
in
a
hurry
to
be
off
and
hoped
to
reach
george
that
very
night
if
no
obstacle
was
encountered
i
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
compartment
and
rejoined
lieutenant
davon
who
was
standing
by
the
man
at
the
wheel
in
the
after
compartment
three
other
men
including
the
engineer
awaited
the
lieutenant
orders
to
set
the
machinery
in
motion
lieutenant
davon
i
said
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
particular
reason
why
i
should
stay
in
there
with
roch
if
i
can
help
you
to
get
through
the
tunnel
pray
command
me
yes
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
by
me
mr
hart
it
was
then
exactly
minutes
past
eight
the
threw
a
vague
light
through
the
water
ahead
of
the
from
where
we
were
we
had
to
cross
the
lagoon
through
its
entire
length
to
get
to
the
tunnel
it
would
be
pretty
difficult
to
fetch
it
we
knew
but
if
necessary
we
could
hug
the
sides
of
the
lake
until
we
located
it
once
outside
the
tunnel
the
would
rise
to
the
surface
and
make
for
george
at
full
speed
at
what
depth
are
we
now
i
asked
the
lieutenant
about
a
fathom
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
any
lower
i
said
from
what
i
was
able
to
observe
during
the
equinoctial
tides
i
should
think
that
we
are
in
the
axis
of
the
tunnel
all
right
he
replied
yes
it
was
all
right
and
i
felt
that
providence
was
speaking
by
the
mouth
of
the
officer
certainly
providence
could
not
have
chosen
a
better
agent
to
work
its
will
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
i
examined
him
he
was
about
thirty
years
of
age
cool
phlegmatic
with
resolute
physiognomy
the
english
officer
in
all
his
native
impassibility
no
more
disturbed
than
if
he
had
been
on
board
the
operating
with
extraordinary
i
might
even
say
with
the
precision
of
a
machine
on
coming
through
the
tunnel
i
estimated
its
length
at
about
fifty
yards
he
remarked
yes
lieutenant
about
fifty
yards
from
one
extremity
to
the
other
this
calculation
must
have
been
pretty
exact
since
the
new
tunnel
cut
on
a
level
with
the
coast
is
feet
in
length
the
order
was
given
to
go
ahead
and
the
moved
forward
very
slowly
for
fear
of
colliding
against
the
rocky
side
sometimes
we
came
near
enough
to
it
to
distinguish
a
black
mass
ahead
of
it
but
a
turn
of
the
wheel
put
us
in
the
right
direction
again
navigating
a
submarine
boat
in
the
open
sea
is
difficult
enough
how
much
more
so
in
the
confines
of
a
lagoon
after
five
minutes
manoeuvring
the
which
was
kept
at
about
a
fathom
below
the
surface
had
not
succeeded
in
sighting
the
orifice
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
return
to
the
surface
lieutenant
i
said
we
should
then
be
able
to
see
where
we
are
i
think
you
are
right
hart
if
you
can
point
out
just
about
where
the
tunnel
is
located
i
think
i
can
very
well
then
as
a
precaution
the
light
was
turned
off
the
engineer
set
the
pumps
in
motion
and
lightened
of
its
water
ballast
the
boat
slowly
rose
in
the
darkness
to
the
surface
i
remained
at
my
post
so
that
i
could
peer
through
the
lookouts
at
last
the
ascensional
movement
of
the
stopped
and
the
periscope
emerged
about
a
foot
on
one
side
of
me
lighted
by
the
lamp
by
the
shore
i
could
see
the
beehive
what
is
your
opinion
demanded
the
lieutenant
we
are
too
far
north
the
orifice
is
in
the
west
side
of
the
cavern
is
anybody
about
not
a
soul
capital
hart
then
we
will
keep
on
a
level
with
the
surface
and
when
we
are
in
front
of
the
tunnel
and
you
give
the
signal
we
will
sink
it
was
the
best
thing
to
be
done
we
moved
off
again
and
the
pilot
kept
her
head
towards
the
tunnel
when
we
were
about
twelve
yards
off
i
gave
the
signal
to
stop
as
soon
as
the
current
was
turned
off
the
stopped
opened
her
water
tanks
and
slowly
sank
again
then
the
light
in
the
lookout
was
turned
on
again
and
there
in
front
of
us
was
a
black
circle
that
did
not
reflect
the
lamp
rays
there
it
is
there
is
the
tunnel
i
cried
was
it
not
the
door
by
which
i
was
going
to
escape
from
my
prison
was
not
liberty
awaiting
me
on
the
other
side
gently
the
moved
towards
the
orifice
oh
the
horrible
mischance
how
have
i
survived
it
how
is
it
that
my
heart
is
not
broken
a
dim
light
appeared
in
the
depth
of
the
tunnel
about
yards
in
front
of
us
the
advancing
light
could
be
none
other
than
that
projected
through
the
lookout
of
ker
karraje
submarine
boat
the
tug
the
tug
i
exclaimed
lieutenant
here
is
the
tug
returning
to
back
cup
full
speed
astern
ordered
the
officer
and
the
drew
back
just
as
she
was
about
to
enter
the
tunnel
one
chance
remained
the
lieutenant
had
swiftly
turned
off
the
light
and
it
was
just
possible
that
we
had
not
been
seen
by
the
people
in
the
tug
perhaps
in
the
dark
waters
of
the
lagoon
we
should
escape
notice
and
when
the
oncoming
boat
had
risen
and
moored
to
the
jetty
we
should
be
able
to
slip
out
unperceived
we
had
backed
close
in
to
the
south
side
and
the
was
about
to
stop
but
alas
for
our
hopes
captain
spade
had
seen
that
another
submarine
boat
was
about
to
issue
through
the
tunnel
and
he
was
making
preparations
to
chase
us
how
could
a
frail
craft
like
the
defend
itself
against
the
attacks
of
ker
karraje
powerful
machine
lieutenant
davon
turned
to
me
and
said
go
back
to
the
compartment
where
thomas
roch
is
and
shut
yourself
in
i
will
close
the
there
is
just
a
chance
that
if
the
tug
rams
us
the
compartments
will
keep
us
up
after
shaking
hands
with
the
lieutenant
who
was
as
cool
as
though
we
were
in
no
danger
i
went
forward
and
rejoined
thomas
roch
i
closed
the
door
and
awaited
the
issue
in
profound
darkness
then
i
could
feel
the
desperate
efforts
made
by
the
to
escape
from
or
ram
her
enemy
i
could
feel
her
rushing
gyrating
and
plunging
now
she
would
twist
to
avoid
a
collision
now
she
would
rise
to
the
surface
then
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
lagoon
can
any
one
conceive
such
a
struggle
as
that
in
which
like
two
marine
monsters
these
machines
were
engaged
in
beneath
the
troubled
waters
of
this
inland
lake
a
few
minutes
elapsed
and
i
began
to
think
that
the
had
eluded
the
tug
and
was
rushing
through
the
tunnel
suddenly
there
was
a
collision
the
shock
was
not
it
seemed
to
me
very
violent
but
i
could
be
under
no
illusion
the
had
been
struck
on
her
starboard
quarter
perhaps
her
plates
had
resisted
and
if
not
the
water
would
only
invade
one
of
her
compartments
i
thought
almost
immediately
after
however
there
was
another
shock
that
pushed
the
with
extreme
violence
she
was
raised
by
the
ram
of
the
tug
which
sawed
and
ripped
its
way
into
her
side
then
i
could
feel
her
heel
over
and
sink
straight
down
stern
foremost
thomas
roch
and
i
were
tumbled
over
violently
by
this
movement
there
was
another
bump
another
ripping
sound
and
the
lay
still
just
what
happened
after
that
i
am
unable
to
say
for
i
lost
consciousness
i
have
since
learned
that
all
this
occurred
many
hours
ago
i
however
distinctly
remember
that
my
last
thought
was
if
i
am
to
die
at
any
rate
thomas
roch
and
his
secret
perish
with
me
and
the
pirates
of
back
cup
will
not
escape
punishment
for
their
crimes
chapter
xv
expectation
as
soon
as
i
recover
my
senses
i
find
myself
lying
on
my
bed
in
my
cell
where
it
appears
i
have
been
lying
for
hours
i
am
not
alone
engineer
serko
is
near
me
he
has
attended
to
me
himself
not
because
he
regards
me
as
a
friend
i
surmise
but
as
a
man
from
whom
indispensable
explanations
are
awaited
and
who
afterwards
can
be
done
away
with
if
necessary
i
am
still
so
weak
that
i
could
not
walk
a
step
a
little
more
and
i
should
have
been
asphyxiated
in
that
narrow
compartment
of
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
lagoon
am
i
in
condition
to
reply
to
the
questions
that
engineer
serko
is
dying
to
put
to
me
yes
but
i
shall
maintain
the
utmost
reserve
in
the
first
place
i
wonder
what
has
become
of
lieutenant
davon
and
the
crew
of
the
did
those
brave
englishmen
perish
in
the
collision
are
they
safe
and
sound
like
us
for
i
suppose
that
thomas
roch
has
also
survived
the
first
question
that
engineer
serko
puts
to
me
is
this
will
you
explain
to
me
what
happened
mr
hart
instead
of
replying
it
occurs
to
me
to
question
him
myself
and
thomas
roch
i
inquire
in
good
health
mr
hart
then
he
adds
in
an
imperious
tone
tell
me
what
occurred
in
the
first
place
tell
me
what
became
of
the
others
what
others
replies
serko
glancing
at
me
savagely
why
those
men
who
threw
themselves
upon
thomas
roch
and
me
who
gagged
bound
and
carried
us
off
and
shut
us
up
i
know
not
where
on
reflection
i
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
pretend
that
i
had
been
surprised
before
i
knew
where
i
was
or
who
my
aggressors
were
you
will
know
what
became
of
them
later
but
first
tell
me
how
the
thing
was
done
by
the
threatening
tone
of
his
voice
as
he
for
the
third
time
puts
this
question
i
understand
the
nature
of
the
suspicions
entertained
of
me
yet
to
be
in
the
position
to
accuse
me
of
having
had
relations
with
the
outside
he
would
have
had
to
get
possession
of
my
keg
this
he
could
not
have
done
seeing
that
it
is
in
the
hands
of
the
bermudan
authorities
the
pirates
can
not
i
am
convinced
have
a
single
proof
to
back
up
their
suspicions
i
therefore
recount
how
about
eight
on
the
previous
evening
i
was
walking
along
the
edge
of
the
lagoon
after
thomas
roch
had
passed
me
going
towards
his
laboratory
when
i
felt
myself
seized
from
behind
how
having
been
gagged
bound
and
blindfolded
i
felt
myself
carried
off
and
lowered
into
a
hole
with
another
person
whom
i
thought
i
recognized
from
his
groans
as
thomas
roch
how
i
soon
felt
that
i
was
on
board
a
boat
of
some
description
and
naturally
concluded
that
it
was
the
tug
how
i
felt
it
sink
how
i
felt
a
shock
that
threw
me
violently
against
the
side
and
how
i
felt
myself
suffocating
and
lost
consciousness
since
i
remember
nothing
further
engineer
serko
listens
with
profound
attention
a
stern
look
in
his
eyes
and
a
frown
on
his
brow
and
yet
he
can
have
no
reason
that
authorizes
him
to
doubt
my
word
you
claim
that
three
men
threw
themselves
upon
you
he
asks
yes
i
thought
they
were
some
of
your
people
for
i
did
not
see
them
coming
who
were
they
strangers
as
you
must
have
known
from
their
language
they
did
not
utter
a
word
have
you
no
idea
as
to
their
nationality
not
the
remotest
do
you
know
what
were
their
intentions
in
entering
the
cavern
i
do
not
what
is
your
opinion
about
it
my
opinion
serko
i
repeat
i
thought
they
were
two
or
three
of
your
pirates
who
had
come
to
throw
me
into
the
lagoon
by
the
count
orders
and
that
they
were
going
to
do
the
same
thing
to
thomas
roch
i
supposed
that
having
obtained
his
secrets
as
you
informed
me
was
the
case
you
had
no
further
use
for
him
and
were
about
to
get
rid
of
us
both
is
it
possible
hart
that
you
could
have
thought
such
a
thing
continued
serko
in
his
sarcastic
way
i
did
until
having
been
able
to
remove
the
bandage
from
my
eyes
i
perceived
that
i
was
in
the
tug
it
was
not
the
tug
but
a
boat
of
the
same
kind
that
had
got
through
the
tunnel
a
submarine
boat
i
ejaculate
yes
and
manned
by
persons
whose
mission
was
to
kidnap
you
and
thomas
roch
kidnap
us
i
echo
continuing
to
feign
surprise
and
adds
engineer
serko
i
want
to
know
what
you
think
about
the
matter
what
i
think
about
it
well
it
appears
to
me
that
there
is
only
one
plausible
explanation
possible
if
the
secret
of
your
retreat
has
not
been
betrayed
and
i
can
not
conceive
how
you
could
have
been
betrayed
or
what
imprudence
you
or
yours
could
have
committed
my
opinion
is
that
this
submarine
boat
was
exploring
the
bottom
of
the
sea
in
this
neighborhood
that
she
must
have
found
her
way
into
the
tunnel
that
she
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
lagoon
that
her
crew
greatly
surprised
to
find
themselves
inside
an
inhabited
cavern
seized
hold
of
the
first
persons
they
came
across
thomas
roch
and
myself
and
others
as
well
perhaps
for
of
course
i
do
not
know
engineer
serko
has
become
serious
again
does
he
realize
the
inanity
of
the
hypothesis
i
try
to
pass
off
on
him
does
he
think
i
know
more
than
i
will
say
however
this
may
be
he
accepts
my
professed
view
and
says
in
effect
hart
it
must
have
happened
as
you
suggest
and
when
the
stranger
tried
to
make
her
way
out
through
the
tunnel
just
as
the
tug
was
entering
there
was
a
collision
a
collision
of
which
she
was
the
victim
but
we
are
not
the
kind
of
people
to
allow
our
to
perish
before
our
eyes
moreover
the
disappearance
of
thomas
roch
and
yourself
was
almost
immediately
discovered
two
such
valuable
lives
had
to
be
saved
at
all
hazards
we
set
to
work
there
are
many
expert
divers
among
our
men
they
hastily
donned
their
suits
and
descended
to
the
bottom
of
the
lagoon
they
passed
lines
around
the
hull
of
the
the
i
exclaim
that
is
the
name
we
saw
painted
on
the
bow
of
the
vessel
when
we
raised
her
to
the
surface
what
satisfaction
we
experienced
when
we
recovered
you
unconscious
it
is
true
but
still
breathing
and
were
able
to
bring
you
back
to
life
unfortunately
all
our
attentions
to
the
officer
who
commanded
the
and
to
his
crew
were
useless
the
shock
had
torn
open
the
after
and
middle
compartments
and
they
paid
with
their
lives
the
misfortune
due
to
chance
as
you
observe
of
having
discovered
our
mysterious
retreat
on
learning
that
lieutenant
davon
and
his
companions
are
dead
my
heart
is
filled
with
anguish
but
to
keep
up
my
role
as
they
were
persons
with
whom
presumably
i
was
not
acquainted
and
had
never
seen
i
am
careful
not
to
display
any
emotion
i
must
on
no
account
afford
ground
for
the
suspicion
that
there
was
any
connivance
between
the
commander
of
the
and
me
for
aught
i
know
engineer
serko
may
have
reason
to
be
very
skeptical
about
the
discovery
of
the
tunnel
being
accidental
what
however
i
am
most
concerned
about
is
that
the
occasion
to
recover
my
liberty
was
lost
shall
i
ever
be
afforded
another
chance
however
this
may
be
my
notice
reached
the
english
authorities
of
the
archipelago
and
they
now
know
where
ker
karraje
is
to
be
found
when
it
is
seen
that
the
does
not
return
to
bermuda
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
another
attempt
will
be
made
to
get
inside
back
cup
in
which
had
it
not
been
for
the
inopportune
return
of
the
tug
i
should
no
longer
be
a
prisoner
i
have
resumed
my
usual
existence
and
having
allayed
all
mistrust
am
permitted
to
wander
freely
about
the
cavern
as
usual
it
is
patent
that
the
adventure
has
had
no
ill
effect
upon
thomas
roch
intelligent
nursing
brought
him
around
as
it
did
me
in
full
possession
of
his
mental
faculties
he
has
returned
to
work
and
spends
the
entire
day
in
his
laboratory
the
brought
back
from
her
last
trip
bales
boxes
and
a
quantity
of
objects
of
varied
origin
and
i
conclude
that
a
number
of
ships
must
have
been
pillaged
during
this
marauding
expedition
the
work
on
the
trestles
for
roch
engine
goes
steadily
forward
and
there
are
now
no
fewer
than
fifty
engines
if
ker
karraje
and
engineer
serko
are
under
the
necessity
of
defending
back
cup
three
or
four
will
be
sufficient
to
render
the
island
unapproachable
as
they
will
cover
a
zone
which
no
vessel
could
enter
without
being
blown
to
pieces
and
it
occurs
to
me
that
they
intend
to
put
back
cup
in
a
state
of
defence
after
having
argued
as
follows
if
the
appearance
of
the
in
the
lagoon
was
due
to
chance
the
situation
remains
unchanged
and
no
power
not
even
england
will
think
of
seeking
for
the
inside
the
cavern
if
on
the
other
hand
as
the
result
of
an
incomprehensible
revelation
it
has
been
learned
that
back
cup
is
become
the
retreat
of
ker
karraje
if
the
expedition
of
the
was
a
first
effort
against
the
island
another
of
a
different
kind
either
a
bombardment
from
a
distance
or
an
attack
by
a
landing
party
is
to
be
expected
therefore
ere
we
can
quit
back
cup
and
carry
away
our
plunder
we
shall
have
to
defend
ourselves
by
means
of
roch
fulgurator
in
my
opinion
the
rascals
must
have
gone
on
to
reason
still
further
in
this
wise
is
there
any
connection
between
the
disclosure
of
our
secret
if
it
was
and
however
it
may
have
been
made
and
the
double
abduction
from
healthful
house
is
it
known
that
thomas
roch
and
his
keeper
are
confined
in
back
cup
is
it
known
that
the
abduction
was
effected
in
the
interest
of
ker
karraje
have
americans
english
french
germans
and
russians
reason
to
fear
that
an
attack
in
force
against
the
island
would
be
doomed
to
failure
ker
karraje
must
know
very
well
that
these
powers
would
not
hesitate
to
attack
him
however
great
the
danger
might
be
the
destruction
of
his
lair
is
an
urgent
duty
in
the
interest
of
public
security
and
of
humanity
after
sweeping
the
west
pacific
the
pirate
and
his
companions
are
infesting
the
west
atlantic
and
must
be
wiped
out
at
all
costs
in
any
case
it
is
imperative
that
the
inhabitants
of
back
cup
should
be
on
their
guard
this
fact
is
realized
and
from
the
day
on
which
the
was
destroyed
strict
watch
has
been
kept
thanks
to
the
new
passage
they
are
able
to
hide
among
the
rocks
without
having
recourse
to
the
submarine
tunnel
to
get
there
and
day
and
night
a
dozen
sentries
are
posted
about
the
island
the
moment
a
ship
appears
in
sight
the
fact
is
at
once
made
known
inside
the
cavern
nothing
occurs
for
some
days
and
the
latter
succeed
each
other
with
dreadful
monotony
the
pirates
however
feel
that
back
cup
no
longer
enjoys
its
former
security
every
moment
an
alarm
from
the
sentries
posted
outside
is
expected
the
situation
is
no
longer
the
same
since
the
advent
of
the
gallant
lieutenant
davon
gallant
crew
may
england
may
the
civilized
nations
never
forget
that
you
have
sacrificed
your
lives
in
the
cause
of
humanity
it
is
evident
that
now
however
powerful
may
be
their
means
of
defence
even
more
powerful
than
a
network
of
torpedoes
engineer
serko
and
captain
spade
are
filled
with
an
anxiety
that
they
vainly
essay
to
dissemble
they
hold
frequent
conferences
together
maybe
they
discuss
the
advisability
of
quitting
back
cup
with
their
wealth
for
they
are
aware
that
if
the
existence
of
the
cavern
is
known
means
will
be
found
to
reduce
it
even
if
the
inmates
have
to
be
starved
out
this
is
of
course
mere
conjecture
on
my
part
what
is
essential
to
me
is
that
they
do
not
suspect
me
of
having
launched
the
keg
that
was
so
providentially
picked
up
at
bermuda
never
i
must
say
has
engineer
serko
ever
made
any
allusion
to
any
such
probability
no
i
am
not
even
suspected
if
the
contrary
were
the
case
i
am
sufficiently
acquainted
with
ker
karraje
to
know
that
he
would
long
ago
have
sent
me
to
rejoin
lieutenant
davon
and
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
lagoon
the
winter
tempests
have
set
in
with
a
vengeance
the
wind
howls
though
the
hole
in
the
roof
and
rude
gusts
sweep
through
the
forest
of
pillars
producing
sonorous
sounds
so
sonorous
so
deep
that
one
might
sometimes
almost
fancy
they
were
produced
by
the
firing
of
the
guns
of
a
squadron
flocks
of
seabirds
take
refuge
in
the
cavern
from
the
gale
and
at
intervals
when
it
lulls
almost
deafen
us
with
their
screaming
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
in
such
weather
the
schooner
will
make
no
attempt
to
put
to
sea
for
the
stock
of
provisions
is
ample
enough
to
last
all
the
season
moreover
i
imagine
the
count
will
not
be
so
eager
in
future
to
show
his
along
the
american
coast
where
he
risks
being
received
not
as
hitherto
with
the
consideration
due
to
a
wealthy
yachtsman
but
in
the
manner
ker
karraje
so
richly
merits
it
occurs
to
me
that
if
the
apparition
of
the
was
the
commencement
of
a
campaign
against
the
island
a
question
of
great
moment
relative
to
the
future
of
back
cup
arises
therefore
one
day
prudently
so
as
not
to
excite
any
suspicion
i
ventured
to
pump
engineer
serko
about
it
we
were
in
the
neighborhood
of
thomas
roch
laboratory
and
had
been
conversing
for
some
time
when
engineer
serko
touched
upon
the
extraordinary
apparition
of
an
english
submarine
boat
in
the
lagoon
on
this
occasion
he
seemed
to
incline
to
the
view
that
it
might
have
been
a
premeditated
expedition
against
ker
karraje
that
is
not
my
opinion
i
replied
in
order
to
bring
him
to
the
question
that
i
wanted
to
put
to
him
why
he
demanded
because
if
your
retreat
were
known
a
fresh
attempt
if
not
to
penetrate
to
the
cavern
at
least
to
destroy
back
cup
would
ere
this
have
been
made
destroy
it
cried
serko
it
would
be
a
dangerous
undertaking
in
view
of
the
means
of
defence
of
which
we
now
dispose
they
can
know
nothing
about
this
matter
serko
it
is
not
imagined
either
in
the
new
world
or
the
old
that
the
abduction
from
healthful
house
was
effected
for
your
especial
benefit
or
that
you
have
succeeded
in
coming
to
terms
with
thomas
roch
for
his
invention
engineer
serko
made
no
response
to
this
observation
which
for
that
matter
was
unanswerable
i
continued
therefore
a
squadron
sent
by
the
maritime
powers
who
have
an
interest
in
breaking
up
this
island
would
not
hesitate
to
approach
and
shell
it
now
i
argue
from
this
that
as
this
squadron
has
not
yet
appeared
it
is
not
likely
to
come
at
all
and
that
nothing
is
known
as
to
ker
karraje
whereabouts
and
you
must
admit
that
this
hypothesis
is
the
most
cheerful
one
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
that
may
be
engineer
serko
replied
but
what
is
is
whether
they
are
aware
of
the
fact
or
no
if
warships
approach
within
five
or
six
miles
of
this
island
they
will
be
sunk
before
they
have
had
time
to
fire
a
single
shot
well
and
what
then
what
then
why
the
probability
is
that
no
others
would
care
to
repeat
the
experiment
that
again
may
be
but
these
warships
would
invest
you
beyond
the
dangerous
zone
and
the
would
not
be
able
to
put
in
to
the
ports
she
previously
visited
with
the
count
in
this
event
how
would
you
be
able
to
provision
the
island
engineer
serko
remained
silent
this
argument
which
he
must
already
have
brooded
over
was
too
logical
to
be
refuted
or
dismissed
and
i
have
an
idea
that
the
pirates
contemplate
abandoning
back
cup
nevertheless
not
relishing
being
cornered
he
continued
we
should
still
have
the
tug
and
what
the
could
not
do
this
would
the
tug
i
cried
but
if
ker
karraje
secrets
are
known
do
you
suppose
the
powers
are
not
also
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
count
submarine
boat
engineer
serko
looked
at
me
suspiciously
hart
he
said
you
appear
to
me
to
carry
your
deductions
rather
far
i
mr
serko
yes
and
i
think
you
talk
about
all
this
like
a
man
who
knows
more
than
he
ought
to
this
remark
brought
me
up
abruptly
it
was
evident
that
my
arguments
might
give
rise
to
the
suspicion
that
i
was
not
altogether
irresponsible
for
the
recent
incident
engineer
serko
scrutinized
me
sharply
as
though
he
would
read
my
innermost
thoughts
serko
i
observed
by
profession
as
well
as
by
inclination
i
am
accustomed
to
reason
upon
everything
this
is
why
i
communicated
to
you
the
result
of
my
reasoning
which
you
can
take
into
consideration
or
not
as
you
like
thereupon
we
separate
but
i
fancy
my
lack
of
reserve
may
have
excited
suspicions
which
may
not
be
easy
to
allay
from
this
interview
however
i
gleaned
a
precious
bit
of
information
namely
that
the
dangerous
zone
of
roch
fulgurator
is
between
five
and
six
miles
off
perhaps
during
the
next
equinoctial
tides
another
notice
to
this
effect
in
another
keg
may
also
reach
a
safe
destination
but
how
many
weary
months
to
wait
before
the
orifice
of
the
tunnel
will
again
be
uncovered
the
rough
weather
continues
and
the
squalls
are
more
violent
than
ever
is
it
the
state
of
the
sea
that
delays
another
campaign
against
back
cup
lieutenant
davon
certainly
assured
me
that
if
his
expedition
failed
if
the
did
not
return
to
george
another
attempt
under
different
conditions
would
be
made
with
a
view
to
breaking
up
this
bandits
lair
sooner
or
later
the
work
of
justice
must
be
done
and
back
cup
be
destroyed
even
though
i
may
not
survive
its
destruction
ah
why
can
i
not
go
and
breathe
if
only
for
a
single
instant
the
vivifying
air
outside
why
am
i
not
permitted
to
cast
one
glance
over
the
ocean
towards
the
distant
horizon
of
the
bermudas
my
whole
life
is
concentrated
in
one
desire
to
get
through
the
tunnel
in
the
wall
and
hide
myself
among
the
rocks
perchance
i
might
be
the
first
to
catch
sight
of
the
smoke
of
a
squadron
heading
for
the
island
this
project
alas
is
unrealizable
as
sentries
are
posted
day
and
night
at
each
extremity
of
the
passage
no
one
can
enter
it
without
engineer
serko
authorization
were
i
to
attempt
it
i
should
risk
being
deprived
of
my
liberty
to
walk
about
the
cavern
and
even
worse
might
happen
to
me
since
our
last
conversation
engineer
serko
attitude
towards
me
has
undergone
a
change
his
gaze
has
lost
its
sarcasm
and
is
distrustful
suspicious
searching
and
as
stern
as
ker
karraje
this
afternoon
there
was
a
great
commotion
in
the
beehive
and
the
men
rushed
out
of
their
cells
with
loud
cries
i
was
reclining
on
my
bed
but
immediately
rose
and
hurried
out
all
the
pirates
were
making
for
the
passage
in
front
of
which
were
ker
karraje
engineer
serko
captain
spade
boatswain
effrondat
gibson
and
the
count
big
malay
attendant
i
soon
learn
the
reason
for
the
tumult
for
the
sentries
rush
in
with
shouts
of
alarm
several
vessels
have
been
sighted
to
the
northwest
warships
steaming
at
full
speed
in
the
direction
of
back
cup
chapter
xvi
only
a
few
more
hours
what
effect
this
news
has
upon
me
and
what
emotion
it
awakens
within
my
soul
the
end
i
feel
is
at
hand
may
it
be
such
as
civilization
and
humanity
are
entitled
to
up
to
the
present
i
have
indited
my
notes
day
by
day
henceforward
it
is
imperative
that
i
should
inscribe
them
hour
by
hour
minute
by
minute
who
knows
but
what
thomas
roch
last
secret
may
be
revealed
to
me
and
that
i
shall
have
time
to
commit
it
to
paper
should
i
die
during
the
attack
god
grant
that
the
account
of
the
five
months
i
have
passed
in
back
cup
may
be
found
upon
my
body
at
first
ker
karraje
engineer
serko
captain
spade
and
several
of
their
companions
took
up
position
on
the
exterior
base
of
the
island
what
would
i
not
give
to
be
able
follow
to
them
and
in
the
friendly
shelter
of
a
rook
watch
the
warships
an
hour
later
they
return
after
having
left
a
score
of
men
to
keep
watch
as
the
days
at
this
season
of
the
year
are
very
short
there
is
nothing
to
fear
before
the
morrow
it
is
not
likely
that
the
ships
will
attempt
a
night
attack
and
land
a
storming
party
for
they
must
imagine
that
the
place
is
in
a
thorough
condition
of
defence
all
night
long
the
pirates
work
installing
the
trestles
at
different
points
of
the
coast
six
have
been
taken
through
the
passage
to
places
selected
in
advance
this
done
engineer
serko
joins
thomas
roch
in
his
laboratory
is
he
going
to
tell
him
what
is
passing
that
a
squadron
is
in
view
of
back
cup
and
that
his
fulgurator
will
be
employed
to
defend
the
island
what
is
certain
is
that
half
a
hundred
engines
each
charged
with
several
pounds
of
the
explosive
and
of
the
substance
that
ensures
a
trajectory
superior
to
that
of
any
other
projectile
are
ready
for
their
work
of
destruction
as
to
the
deflagrator
liquid
thomas
roch
has
a
certain
number
of
phials
of
it
and
i
know
only
too
well
will
not
refuse
to
help
ker
karraje
pirates
with
it
during
these
preparations
night
has
come
on
only
the
lamps
of
the
beehive
are
lighted
and
a
reigns
in
the
cavern
i
return
to
my
cell
it
is
to
my
interest
to
keep
out
of
the
way
as
much
as
possible
for
engineer
serko
suspicions
might
be
revived
now
that
the
squadron
is
approaching
back
cup
but
will
the
vessels
sighted
continue
on
their
course
in
this
direction
may
they
not
be
merely
passing
on
their
way
to
bermuda
for
an
instant
this
doubt
enters
my
mind
no
no
it
can
not
be
besides
i
have
just
heard
captain
spade
declare
that
they
are
lying
to
in
view
of
the
island
to
what
nation
do
they
belong
have
the
english
desirous
of
avenging
the
destruction
of
the
alone
undertaken
the
expedition
may
not
cruisers
of
other
nations
be
with
them
i
know
not
and
it
is
impossible
to
ascertain
and
what
does
it
matter
after
all
so
long
as
this
haunt
is
destroyed
even
though
i
should
perish
in
the
ruins
like
the
heroic
lieutenant
davon
and
his
brave
crew
preparations
for
defence
continue
with
coolness
and
method
under
engineer
serko
superintendence
these
pirates
are
obviously
certain
that
they
will
be
able
to
annihilate
their
assailants
as
soon
as
the
latter
enter
the
dangerous
zone
their
confidence
in
roch
fulgurator
is
absolute
absorbed
by
the
idea
that
these
warship
are
powerless
against
them
they
think
neither
of
the
difficulties
nor
menaces
held
out
by
the
future
i
surmise
that
the
trestles
have
been
set
up
on
the
northwest
coast
with
the
grooves
turned
to
send
the
engines
to
the
north
west
and
south
on
the
east
as
already
stated
the
island
is
defended
by
the
chain
of
reefs
that
stretches
away
to
the
bermudas
about
nine
i
venture
out
of
my
cell
they
will
pay
little
attention
to
me
and
perhaps
i
may
escape
notice
in
the
obscurity
ah
if
i
could
get
through
that
passage
and
hide
behind
some
rock
so
that
i
could
witness
what
goes
on
at
daybreak
and
why
should
i
not
succeed
now
that
ker
karraje
engineer
serko
captain
spade
and
the
pirates
have
taken
their
posts
outside
the
shores
of
the
lake
are
deserted
but
the
entrance
to
the
passage
is
kept
by
count
malay
i
saunter
without
any
fixed
idea
towards
thomas
roch
laboratory
this
reminds
me
of
my
compatriot
i
am
on
reflection
disposed
to
think
that
he
knows
nothing
about
the
presence
of
a
squadron
off
back
cup
probably
not
until
the
last
moment
will
engineer
serko
apprise
him
of
its
proximity
not
till
he
brusquely
points
out
to
him
the
vengeance
he
can
accomplish
then
i
conceive
the
idea
of
enlightening
thomas
roch
myself
of
the
responsibility
he
is
incurring
and
of
revealing
to
him
in
this
supreme
hour
the
character
of
the
men
who
want
him
to
in
their
criminal
projects
yes
i
will
attempt
it
and
may
i
succeed
in
fanning
into
a
flame
any
spark
of
patriotism
that
may
still
linger
in
his
rebellious
soul
roch
is
shut
up
in
his
laboratory
he
must
be
alone
for
never
does
he
allow
any
one
to
enter
while
he
is
preparing
his
deflagrator
as
i
pass
the
jetty
i
notice
that
the
tug
is
moored
in
its
accustomed
place
here
i
judge
it
prudent
to
walk
behind
the
first
row
of
pillars
and
approach
the
laboratory
laterally
which
will
enable
me
to
see
whether
anybody
is
with
him
when
i
have
gone
a
short
distance
along
the
sombre
avenue
i
see
a
bright
light
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lagoon
it
is
the
electric
light
in
roch
laboratory
as
seen
through
a
narrow
window
in
the
front
except
in
that
particular
spot
the
southern
shore
of
the
lake
is
in
darkness
whereas
in
the
opposite
direction
the
beehive
is
lit
up
to
its
extremity
at
the
northern
wall
through
the
opening
in
the
dome
over
the
lake
i
can
see
the
stars
shining
the
sky
is
clear
the
tempest
has
abated
and
the
squalls
no
longer
penetrate
to
the
interior
of
back
cup
when
near
the
laboratory
i
creep
along
the
wall
and
peep
in
at
the
window
thomas
roch
is
there
alone
the
light
shines
full
on
his
face
if
it
is
somewhat
drawn
and
the
lines
on
the
forehead
are
more
pronounced
his
physiognomy
at
least
denotes
perfect
calmness
and
no
he
is
no
longer
the
inmate
of
pavilion
no
the
madman
of
healthful
house
and
i
ask
myself
whether
he
is
not
radically
cured
whether
there
is
no
further
danger
of
his
reason
collapsing
in
a
final
paroxysm
he
has
just
laid
two
glass
phials
upon
the
table
and
holds
a
third
in
his
hand
he
holds
it
up
to
the
light
and
observes
the
limpidity
of
the
liquid
it
contains
i
have
half
a
mind
to
rush
in
seize
the
tubes
and
smash
them
but
i
reflect
that
he
would
have
time
to
make
some
more
of
the
stuff
better
stick
to
my
first
plan
i
push
the
door
open
and
enter
thomas
roch
i
exclaim
he
has
not
heard
nor
has
he
seen
me
thomas
roch
i
repeat
he
raises
his
head
turns
and
gazes
at
me
ah
it
is
you
simon
hart
he
replies
calmly
even
indifferently
he
knows
my
name
engineer
serko
must
have
informed
him
that
it
was
simon
hart
and
not
keeper
gaydon
who
was
watching
over
him
at
healthful
house
you
know
who
i
am
i
say
yes
as
i
know
what
your
object
was
in
undertaking
such
a
position
you
lived
in
hopes
of
surprising
a
secret
that
they
would
not
pay
for
at
its
just
value
thomas
roch
knows
everything
and
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
in
view
of
what
i
am
going
to
say
well
you
did
not
succeed
simon
hart
and
as
far
as
this
is
concerned
he
added
flourishing
the
phial
no
one
else
has
succeeded
or
ever
will
succeed
as
i
conjectured
he
has
not
then
made
known
the
composition
of
his
deflagrator
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
i
reply
you
know
who
i
am
thomas
roch
but
do
you
know
in
whose
place
you
are
in
my
own
place
he
cries
that
is
what
ker
karraje
has
permitted
him
to
believe
the
inventor
thinks
he
is
at
home
in
back
cup
that
the
riches
accumulated
in
this
cavern
are
his
and
that
if
an
attack
is
made
upon
the
place
it
will
be
with
the
object
of
stealing
what
belongs
to
him
and
he
will
defend
it
under
the
impression
that
he
has
the
right
to
do
so
thomas
roch
i
continue
listen
to
me
what
do
you
want
to
say
to
me
simon
hart
this
cavern
into
which
we
have
been
dragged
is
occupied
by
a
band
of
pirates
and
roch
does
not
give
me
time
to
complete
the
sentence
i
doubt
even
whether
he
has
understood
me
i
repeat
he
interrupts
vehemently
that
the
treasures
stored
here
are
the
price
of
my
invention
they
have
paid
me
what
i
asked
for
my
fulgurator
what
i
was
everywhere
else
refused
even
in
my
own
country
which
is
also
yours
and
i
will
not
allow
myself
to
be
despoiled
what
can
i
reply
to
such
insensate
assertions
i
however
go
on
thomas
roch
do
you
remember
healthful
house
healthful
house
where
i
was
sequestrated
after
warder
gaydon
had
been
entrusted
with
the
mission
of
spying
upon
me
in
order
to
rob
me
of
my
secret
i
do
indeed
i
never
dreamed
of
depriving
you
of
the
benefit
of
your
secret
thomas
roch
i
would
never
have
accepted
such
a
mission
but
you
were
ill
your
reason
was
affected
and
your
invention
was
too
valuable
to
be
lost
yes
had
you
disclosed
the
secret
during
one
of
your
fits
you
would
have
preserved
all
the
benefit
and
all
the
honor
of
it
really
simon
hart
roch
replies
disdainfully
honor
and
benefit
your
assurances
come
somewhat
late
in
the
day
you
forget
that
on
the
pretext
of
insanity
i
was
thrown
into
a
dungeon
yes
it
was
a
pretext
for
my
reason
has
never
left
me
even
for
an
hour
as
you
can
see
from
what
i
have
accomplished
since
i
am
free
free
do
you
imagine
you
are
free
thomas
roch
are
you
not
more
closely
confined
within
the
walls
of
this
cavern
than
you
ever
were
at
healthful
house
a
man
who
is
in
his
own
home
he
replies
angrily
goes
out
as
he
likes
and
when
he
likes
i
have
only
to
say
the
word
and
all
the
doors
will
open
before
me
this
place
is
mine
count
gave
it
to
me
with
everything
it
contains
woe
to
those
who
attempt
to
attack
it
i
have
here
the
wherewithal
to
annihilate
them
simon
hart
the
inventor
waves
the
phial
feverishly
as
he
speaks
the
count
has
deceived
you
i
cry
as
he
has
deceived
so
many
others
under
this
name
is
dissembled
one
of
the
most
formidable
monsters
who
ever
scoured
the
pacific
and
atlantic
oceans
he
is
a
bandit
steeped
in
crime
he
is
the
odious
ker
karraje
ker
karraje
echoes
thomas
roch
and
i
wonder
if
this
name
has
not
impressed
him
if
he
remembers
who
the
man
is
who
bears
it
if
it
did
impress
him
it
was
only
momentarily
i
do
not
know
this
ker
karraje
he
says
pointing
towards
the
door
to
order
me
out
i
only
know
the
count
thomas
roch
i
persist
in
a
final
effort
the
count
and
ker
karraje
are
one
and
the
same
person
if
this
man
has
purchased
your
secret
it
is
with
the
intention
of
ensuring
impunity
for
his
crimes
and
facilities
for
committing
fresh
ones
he
is
the
chief
of
these
pirates
pirates
cries
roch
whose
irritation
increases
the
more
i
press
him
the
real
pirates
are
those
who
dare
to
menace
me
even
in
this
retreat
who
tried
it
on
with
the
for
serko
has
told
me
everything
who
sought
to
steal
in
my
own
home
what
belongs
to
me
what
is
but
the
just
price
of
my
discovery
no
thomas
roch
the
pirates
are
those
who
have
imprisoned
you
in
this
cavern
of
back
cup
who
will
utilize
your
genius
to
defend
it
and
who
will
get
rid
of
you
when
they
are
in
entire
possession
of
your
secrets
thomas
roch
here
interrupts
me
he
does
not
appear
to
listen
to
what
i
say
he
has
a
fixed
idea
that
of
vengeance
which
has
been
skilfully
worked
upon
by
engineer
serko
and
in
which
his
hatred
is
concentrated
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
the
bandits
he
hisses
are
those
who
spurned
me
without
a
hearing
who
heaped
injustice
and
ignominy
upon
me
who
drove
me
from
country
to
country
whereas
i
offered
them
superiority
invincibleness
omnipotence
it
is
the
eternal
story
of
the
unappreciated
inventor
to
whom
the
indifferent
or
envious
refuse
the
means
of
testing
his
inventions
to
pay
him
the
value
he
sets
upon
them
i
know
it
well
and
also
know
all
the
exaggeration
that
has
been
written
upon
this
subject
it
is
clearly
no
time
for
reasoning
with
thomas
roch
my
arguments
are
entirely
lost
upon
the
hapless
dupe
of
ker
karraje
and
his
accomplices
in
revealing
to
him
the
real
name
of
the
count
and
denouncing
to
him
this
band
and
their
chief
i
had
hoped
to
wean
him
from
their
influence
and
make
him
realize
the
criminal
end
they
have
in
view
my
hope
was
vain
he
does
not
believe
me
and
then
what
does
he
care
whether
the
brigand
name
is
count
or
ker
karraje
is
not
he
thomas
roch
master
of
back
cup
is
he
not
the
owner
of
these
riches
accumulated
by
twenty
years
of
murder
and
rapine
disarmed
before
such
moral
degeneracy
knowing
not
how
i
can
touch
his
ulcerated
irresponsible
heart
i
turn
towards
the
door
it
only
remains
for
me
to
withdraw
what
is
to
be
will
be
since
it
is
out
of
my
power
to
prevent
the
frightful
that
will
occur
in
a
few
hours
thomas
roch
takes
no
more
notice
of
me
he
seems
to
have
forgotten
that
i
am
here
he
has
resumed
his
manipulations
without
realizing
that
he
is
not
alone
there
is
only
one
means
of
preventing
the
imminent
catastrophe
throw
myself
upon
roch
place
him
beyond
the
power
of
doing
harm
strike
him
kill
him
yes
kill
him
it
is
my
right
it
is
my
duty
i
have
no
arms
but
on
a
shelf
i
see
some
tools
a
chisel
and
a
hammer
what
is
to
prevent
me
from
knocking
his
brains
out
once
he
is
dead
i
have
but
to
smash
the
phials
and
his
invention
dies
with
him
the
warships
can
approach
land
their
men
upon
the
island
demolish
back
cup
with
their
shells
ker
karraje
and
his
band
will
be
killed
to
a
man
can
i
hesitate
at
a
murder
that
will
bring
about
the
chastisement
of
so
many
crimes
i
advance
to
the
shelf
and
stretch
forth
my
hand
to
seize
the
chisel
as
i
do
so
thomas
roch
turns
round
it
is
too
late
to
strike
a
struggle
would
ensue
the
noise
and
his
cries
would
be
heard
for
there
are
still
some
pirates
not
far
off
i
can
even
now
hear
some
one
approaching
and
have
only
just
time
to
fly
if
i
would
not
be
seen
nevertheless
i
make
one
last
attempt
to
awaken
the
sentiment
of
patriotism
within
him
thomas
roch
i
say
warships
are
in
sight
they
have
come
to
destroy
this
lair
maybe
one
of
them
flies
the
french
flag
he
gazes
at
me
he
was
not
aware
that
back
cup
is
going
to
be
attacked
and
i
have
just
apprised
him
of
the
fact
his
brow
darkens
and
his
eyes
flash
thomas
roch
would
you
dare
to
fire
upon
your
country
flag
the
tricolor
flag
he
raises
his
head
shakes
it
nervously
and
with
a
disdainful
gesture
what
do
you
mean
by
country
i
no
longer
have
any
country
simon
hart
the
inventor
spurned
no
longer
has
a
country
where
he
finds
an
asylum
there
is
his
fatherland
they
seek
to
take
what
is
mine
i
will
defend
it
and
woe
woe
to
those
who
dare
to
attack
me
then
rushing
to
the
door
of
the
laboratory
and
throwing
it
violently
open
he
shouts
so
loudly
that
he
must
be
heard
at
the
beehive
go
get
you
gone
i
have
not
a
second
to
lose
and
i
dash
out
chapter
xvii
one
against
five
for
a
whole
hour
i
wander
about
among
back
cup
dark
vaults
amid
the
stone
trees
to
the
extreme
limit
of
the
cavern
it
is
here
that
i
have
so
often
sought
an
issue
a
crevice
a
crack
through
which
i
might
squeeze
to
the
shore
of
the
island
my
search
has
been
futile
in
my
present
condition
a
prey
to
indefinable
hallucinations
it
seems
to
me
that
these
walls
are
thicker
than
ever
that
they
are
gradually
closing
in
upon
and
will
crush
me
how
long
this
mental
trouble
lasts
i
can
not
say
but
i
afterwards
find
myself
on
the
beehive
side
opposite
the
cell
in
which
i
can
not
hope
for
either
repose
or
sleep
sleep
when
my
brain
is
in
a
whirl
of
excitement
sleep
when
i
am
near
the
end
of
a
situation
that
threatened
to
be
prolonged
for
years
and
years
what
will
the
end
be
as
far
as
i
am
personally
concerned
what
am
i
to
expect
from
the
attack
upon
back
cup
the
success
of
which
i
have
been
unable
to
assure
by
placing
thomas
roch
beyond
the
possibility
of
doing
harm
his
engines
are
ready
to
be
launched
and
as
soon
as
the
vessels
have
reached
the
dangerous
zone
they
will
be
blown
to
atoms
however
this
may
be
i
am
condemned
to
pass
the
remaining
hours
of
the
night
in
my
cell
the
time
has
come
for
me
to
go
in
at
daybreak
i
shall
see
what
is
best
for
me
to
do
meanwhile
for
aught
i
know
i
may
hear
the
thunder
of
roch
fulgurator
as
it
destroys
the
ships
approaching
to
make
a
night
attack
i
take
a
last
look
round
on
the
opposite
side
a
light
a
single
light
is
burning
it
is
the
lamp
in
roch
laboratory
and
it
casts
its
reflection
upon
the
waters
of
the
lake
no
one
is
about
and
it
occurs
to
me
that
the
pirates
must
have
taken
up
their
lighting
positions
outside
and
that
the
beehive
is
empty
then
impelled
by
an
irresistible
instinct
instead
of
returning
to
my
cell
i
creep
along
the
wall
listening
spying
ready
to
hide
if
i
hear
voices
or
footsteps
i
at
length
reach
the
passage
god
in
heaven
no
one
is
on
guard
there
the
passage
is
free
without
giving
myself
time
to
reflect
i
dart
into
the
dark
hole
and
grope
my
way
along
it
soon
i
feel
a
fresher
air
the
salt
vivifying
air
of
the
sea
that
i
have
not
breathed
for
five
months
i
inspire
it
with
avidity
with
all
the
power
of
my
lungs
the
outer
extremity
of
the
passage
appears
against
the
sky
there
is
not
even
a
shadow
in
the
way
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
get
outside
i
lay
down
and
crawl
along
noiselessly
to
the
orifice
and
peer
out
not
a
soul
is
in
sight
by
skirting
the
rocks
towards
the
east
to
the
side
which
can
not
be
approached
from
the
sea
on
account
of
the
reefs
and
which
is
not
likely
to
be
watched
i
reach
a
narrow
excavation
about
two
hundred
and
yards
from
where
the
point
of
the
coast
extends
towards
the
northwest
at
last
i
am
out
of
the
cavern
i
am
not
free
but
it
is
the
beginning
of
freedom
on
the
point
the
forms
of
a
few
sentries
stand
out
against
the
clear
sky
so
motionless
that
they
might
be
mistaken
for
pieces
of
the
rock
on
the
horizon
to
the
west
the
position
lights
of
the
warship
show
in
a
luminous
line
from
a
few
gray
patches
discernable
in
the
east
i
calculate
that
it
must
be
about
five
in
the
morning
it
is
now
light
enough
for
me
to
be
able
to
complete
my
notes
relating
the
details
of
my
visit
to
thomas
laboratory
the
last
lines
my
hand
will
trace
perhaps
i
have
begun
to
write
and
shall
dot
down
the
incidents
of
the
attack
as
they
occur
the
light
damp
mist
that
hangs
over
the
water
soon
lifts
under
the
influence
of
the
breeze
and
at
last
i
can
distinguish
the
warships
there
are
five
of
them
and
they
are
lying
in
a
line
about
six
miles
off
and
consequently
beyond
the
range
of
roch
engines
my
fear
that
after
passing
in
sight
of
the
bermudas
the
squadron
would
continue
on
its
way
to
the
antilles
or
mexico
was
therefore
unfounded
no
there
it
is
awaiting
broad
daylight
in
order
to
attack
back
cup
there
is
a
movement
on
the
coast
three
or
four
pirates
emerge
from
the
rocks
the
sentries
are
recalled
and
draw
in
and
the
entire
band
is
soon
assembled
they
do
not
seek
shelter
inside
the
cavern
knowing
full
well
that
the
ships
can
never
get
near
enough
for
the
shells
of
the
big
guns
to
reach
the
island
i
run
no
risk
of
being
discovered
for
only
my
head
protrudes
above
the
hole
in
the
rock
and
no
one
is
likely
to
come
this
way
the
only
thing
that
worries
me
is
that
serko
or
somebody
else
may
take
it
into
his
head
to
see
if
i
am
in
my
cell
and
if
necessary
to
lock
me
in
though
what
they
have
to
fear
from
me
i
can
not
conceive
at
minutes
past
seven
ker
karraje
engineer
serko
and
captain
spade
advance
to
the
extremity
of
the
point
where
they
sweep
the
horizon
with
their
telescopes
behind
them
the
six
trestles
are
installed
in
the
grooves
of
which
are
autopropulsive
engines
minutes
past
seven
smoke
arises
from
the
stacks
of
the
warships
which
are
getting
under
way
and
will
soon
be
within
range
of
the
engines
horrible
cries
of
joy
salvos
of
hurrahs
howls
of
wild
beasts
i
might
more
appropriately
say
arise
from
the
pirate
horde
at
this
moment
engineer
serko
quits
ker
karraje
whom
he
leaves
with
captain
spade
and
enters
the
cavern
no
doubt
to
fetch
thomas
roch
when
ker
karraje
orders
the
latter
to
launch
his
engines
against
the
ships
will
he
remember
what
i
told
him
will
not
his
crime
appear
to
him
in
all
its
horror
will
he
refuse
to
obey
no
i
am
only
too
convinced
of
the
contrary
it
is
useless
to
entertain
any
illusion
on
the
subject
the
inventor
believes
he
is
on
his
own
property
they
are
going
to
attack
it
he
will
defend
it
the
five
warships
slowly
advance
making
for
the
point
perhaps
they
imagine
on
board
that
thomas
roch
has
not
given
up
his
last
and
greatest
secret
to
the
pirates
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
not
done
so
when
i
threw
the
keg
into
the
lagoon
if
the
commanders
propose
to
land
storming
parties
and
the
ships
advance
into
the
zone
of
danger
there
will
soon
be
nothing
left
of
them
but
bits
of
shapeless
floating
wreckage
here
comes
thomas
roch
accompanied
by
engineer
serko
on
issuing
from
the
passage
both
go
to
the
trestle
that
is
pointing
towards
the
leading
warship
ker
karraje
and
captain
spade
are
awaiting
them
as
far
as
i
am
able
to
judge
roch
is
calm
he
knows
what
he
is
going
to
do
no
hesitation
troubles
the
soul
of
the
hapless
man
whom
hatred
has
led
astray
between
his
fingers
shines
the
glass
phial
containing
the
deflagrator
liquid
he
then
gazes
towards
the
nearest
ship
which
is
about
five
distant
she
is
a
cruiser
of
about
two
thousand
five
hundred
tons
not
more
she
flies
no
flag
but
from
her
build
i
take
her
to
belong
to
a
nation
for
which
no
frenchman
can
entertain
any
particular
regard
the
four
other
warships
remain
behind
it
is
this
cruiser
which
is
to
begin
the
attack
let
her
use
her
guns
then
since
the
pirates
allow
her
to
approach
and
may
the
first
of
her
projectiles
strike
thomas
roch
while
engineer
serko
is
estimating
the
distance
roch
places
himself
behind
the
trestle
three
engines
are
resting
on
it
charged
with
the
explosive
and
which
are
assured
a
long
trajectory
by
the
fusing
matter
without
it
being
necessary
to
impart
a
gyratory
movement
to
them
as
in
the
case
of
inventor
turpin
gyroscopic
projectiles
besides
if
they
drop
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
vessel
they
will
be
quite
near
enough
to
utterly
destroy
it
the
time
has
come
thomas
roch
engineer
serko
cries
and
points
to
the
cruiser
the
latter
is
steaming
slowly
towards
the
northwestern
point
of
the
island
and
is
between
four
and
five
miles
off
roch
nods
assent
and
waves
them
back
from
the
trestle
ker
karraje
captain
spade
and
the
others
draw
back
about
fifty
paces
thomas
roch
then
takes
the
stopper
from
the
phial
which
he
holds
in
his
right
hand
and
successively
pours
into
a
hole
in
the
of
each
engine
a
few
drops
of
the
liquid
which
mixes
with
the
fusing
matter
seconds
elapse
the
time
necessary
for
the
combination
to
be
effected
seconds
during
which
it
seems
to
me
that
my
heart
ceases
to
beat
a
frightful
whistling
is
then
heard
and
the
three
engines
tear
through
the
air
describing
a
prolonged
curve
at
a
height
of
three
hundred
feet
and
pass
the
cruiser
have
they
missed
it
is
the
danger
over
no
the
engines
after
the
manner
of
artillery
captain
discoid
projectile
return
towards
the
doomed
vessel
like
an
australian
boomerang
the
next
instant
the
air
is
shaken
with
a
violence
comparable
to
that
which
would
be
caused
by
the
explosion
of
a
magazine
of
melinite
or
dynamite
back
cup
island
trembles
to
its
very
foundations
the
cruiser
has
disappeared
blown
to
pieces
the
effect
is
that
of
the
zalinski
shell
but
centupled
by
the
infinite
power
of
fulgurator
what
shouts
the
bandits
raise
as
they
rush
towards
the
extremity
of
the
point
ker
karraje
engineer
serko
and
captain
spade
remain
rooted
to
the
spot
hardly
able
to
credit
the
evidence
of
their
own
eyes
as
to
thomas
roch
he
stands
with
folded
arms
and
flashing
eyes
his
face
radiant
with
pride
and
triumph
i
understand
while
i
abhor
his
feelings
if
the
other
warships
approach
they
will
share
the
same
fate
as
the
cruiser
they
will
inevitably
be
destroyed
oh
if
they
would
but
give
up
the
struggle
and
withdraw
to
safety
even
though
my
last
hope
would
go
with
them
the
nations
can
consult
and
arrive
at
some
other
plan
for
destroying
the
island
they
can
surround
the
place
with
a
belt
of
ships
that
the
pirates
can
not
break
through
and
starve
them
to
death
like
so
many
rats
in
a
hole
but
i
know
that
the
warships
will
not
retire
even
though
they
know
they
are
going
to
certain
death
one
after
the
other
they
will
all
make
the
attempt
and
i
am
right
signals
are
exchanged
between
them
almost
immediately
clouds
of
black
smoke
arise
and
the
vessels
again
advance
one
of
them
under
forced
draught
distances
the
others
in
her
anxiety
to
bring
her
big
guns
quickly
into
action
at
all
risks
i
issue
from
my
hole
and
gaze
at
the
warship
with
feverish
eyes
awaiting
without
being
able
to
prevent
it
another
catastrophe
this
vessel
which
visibly
grows
larger
as
it
comes
nearer
is
a
cruiser
of
about
the
same
tonnage
as
the
one
that
preceded
her
no
flag
is
flying
and
i
can
not
guess
her
nationality
she
continues
steaming
at
full
speed
in
an
effort
to
pass
the
zone
of
danger
before
other
engines
can
be
launched
but
how
can
she
escape
them
since
they
will
swoop
back
upon
her
thomas
roch
places
himself
behind
the
second
trestle
as
the
cruiser
passes
on
to
the
surface
of
the
abysm
in
which
she
will
in
turn
soon
be
swallowed
up
no
sound
disturbs
the
stillness
suddenly
the
rolling
of
drums
and
the
blare
of
bugles
is
heard
on
board
the
warship
i
know
those
bugle
calls
they
are
french
bugles
great
god
she
is
one
of
the
ships
of
my
own
country
navy
and
a
french
inventor
is
about
to
destroy
her
no
it
shall
not
be
i
will
rush
towards
thomas
roch
shout
to
him
that
she
is
a
french
ship
he
does
not
can
not
know
it
at
a
sign
from
engineer
serko
the
inventor
has
raised
the
phial
the
bugles
sound
louder
and
more
strident
it
is
the
salute
to
the
flag
a
flag
unfurls
to
the
breeze
the
tricolor
whose
blue
white
and
red
sections
stand
out
luminously
against
the
sky
ah
what
is
this
i
understand
thomas
roch
is
fascinated
at
the
sight
of
his
national
emblem
slowly
he
lowers
his
arm
as
the
flag
flutters
up
to
the
then
he
draws
back
and
covers
his
eyes
with
his
hand
heavens
above
all
sentiment
of
patriotism
is
not
then
dead
in
his
ulcerated
heart
seeing
that
it
beats
at
the
sight
of
his
flag
my
emotion
is
not
less
than
his
at
the
risk
of
being
seen
and
what
do
i
now
care
if
i
am
seen
i
creep
over
the
rocks
i
will
be
there
to
sustain
thomas
roch
and
prevent
him
from
weakening
if
i
pay
for
it
with
my
life
i
will
once
more
adjure
him
in
the
name
of
his
country
i
will
cry
to
him
frenchman
it
is
the
tricolor
that
flies
on
yonder
ship
frenchman
it
is
a
very
part
of
france
that
is
approaching
you
frenchman
would
you
be
so
criminal
as
to
strike
it
but
my
intervention
will
not
be
necessary
thomas
roch
is
not
a
prey
to
one
of
the
fits
to
which
he
was
formerly
subject
he
is
perfectly
sane
when
he
found
himself
facing
the
flag
he
understood
and
drew
back
a
few
pirates
approach
to
lead
him
to
the
trestle
again
he
struggles
and
pushes
them
from
him
ker
karraje
and
engineer
serko
run
up
they
point
to
the
rapidly
advancing
ship
they
order
him
to
launch
his
engines
thomas
roch
refuses
captain
spade
and
the
others
mad
with
rage
menace
him
curse
him
strike
him
try
to
wrest
the
phial
from
him
roch
throws
it
on
the
ground
and
crushes
it
under
foot
then
panic
seizes
upon
the
crowd
of
wretches
the
cruiser
has
passed
the
zone
and
they
can
not
return
her
fire
shells
begin
to
rain
all
over
the
island
bursting
the
rocks
in
every
direction
but
where
is
thomas
roch
has
he
been
killed
by
one
of
the
projectiles
no
i
see
him
for
the
last
time
as
he
dashes
into
the
passage
ker
karraje
engineer
serko
and
the
others
follow
him
to
seek
shelter
inside
of
back
cup
i
will
not
return
to
the
cavern
at
any
price
even
if
i
get
killed
by
staying
where
i
am
i
will
jot
down
my
final
notes
and
when
the
french
sailors
land
on
the
point
i
will
go
end

notes
chapter
xviii
on
board
the
tonnant
after
the
failure
of
lieutenant
davon
mission
with
the
the
english
authorities
waited
in
vain
for
the
expedition
to
return
and
the
conviction
at
length
gained
ground
that
the
bold
sailors
had
perished
but
whether
the
had
been
lost
by
striking
against
a
rock
or
had
been
destroyed
by
ker
karraje
pirates
could
not
of
course
be
ascertained
the
object
of
the
expedition
based
upon
the
indications
of
the
document
found
in
the
keg
that
was
thrown
up
on
the
shore
at
george
was
to
carry
off
thomas
roch
ere
his
engines
were
completed
the
french
inventor
having
been
recovered
without
forgetting
engineer
simon
hart
he
was
to
be
handed
over
to
the
care
of
the
bermudan
authorities
that
done
there
would
be
nothing
to
fear
from
his
fulgurator
when
the
island
was
attacked
when
however
the
had
been
given
up
for
lost
another
expedition
of
a
different
kind
was
decided
upon
the
time
that
had
elapsed
nearly
eight
weeks
from
the
date
of
the
document
found
in
the
keg
had
to
be
taken
into
consideration
it
was
thought
that
during
the
interval
ker
karraje
might
have
gained
possession
of
roch
secrets
an
concluded
between
the
maritime
powers
resulted
in
the
sending
of
five
warships
to
bermudan
waters
as
there
was
a
vast
cavern
inside
back
cup
mountain
it
was
decided
to
attempt
to
bring
the
latter
down
like
the
walls
of
a
bastion
by
bombarding
it
with
powerful
modern
artillery
the
squadron
assembled
at
the
entrance
to
the
chesapeake
in
virginia
and
sailed
for
the
archipelago
which
was
sighted
on
the
evening
of
november
the
next
morning
the
vessel
selected
for
the
first
attack
steamed
forward
it
was
about
four
and
a
half
miles
from
the
island
when
three
engines
after
passing
the
vessel
swerved
round
and
exploded
about
sixty
yards
from
her
she
sank
immediately
the
effect
of
the
explosion
which
was
superior
to
any
previously
obtained
by
new
explosives
was
instantaneous
even
at
the
distance
they
were
from
the
spot
where
it
occurred
the
four
remaining
ships
felt
the
shock
severely
two
things
were
to
be
deduced
from
this
sudden
catastrophe
the
pirate
ker
karraje
was
in
possession
of
roch
fulgurator
the
new
engine
possessed
the
destructive
power
attributed
to
it
by
its
inventor
after
the
disappearance
of
the
unfortunate
cruiser
the
other
vessels
lowered
boats
to
pick
up
a
few
survivors
who
were
clinging
to
the
floating
wreckage
then
it
was
that
the
signals
were
exchanged
and
the
warships
started
towards
the
island
the
swiftest
of
them
the
a
french
cruiser
forged
ahead
while
the
others
forced
their
draught
in
an
effort
to
catch
up
with
her
the
at
the
risk
of
being
blown
to
pieces
in
turn
penetrated
the
danger
zone
half
a
mile
and
then
ran
up
her
flag
while
manoeuvring
to
bring
her
heavy
guns
into
action
from
the
bridge
the
officers
could
see
ker
karraje
band
scattered
on
the
rocks
of
the
island
the
occasion
was
an
excellent
one
for
getting
a
shot
at
them
before
the
bombardment
of
their
retreat
was
begun
and
fire
was
opened
with
the
result
that
the
pirates
made
a
rush
to
get
into
the
cavern
a
few
minutes
later
there
was
a
shock
terrific
enough
to
shake
the
sky
down
where
the
mountain
had
been
naught
but
a
heap
of
smoking
crumbling
rocks
was
to
be
seen
back
cup
had
become
a
group
of
jagged
reefs
against
which
the
sea
that
had
been
thrown
back
like
a
gigantic
tidal
wave
was
beating
and
frothing
what
was
the
cause
of
the
explosion
had
it
been
voluntarily
caused
by
the
pirates
when
they
realized
that
escape
was
impossible
the
had
not
been
seriously
damaged
by
the
flying
rocks
her
boats
were
lowered
and
made
towards
all
that
was
left
of
back
cup
the
landing
parties
explored
the
ruins
and
found
a
few
horribly
mangled
corpses
not
a
vestige
of
the
cavern
was
to
be
seen
one
body
and
one
only
was
found
intact
it
was
lying
on
the
northeast
side
of
the
reefs
in
one
hand
tightly
clasped
was
a
the
last
line
of
which
was
incomplete
a
close
examination
showed
that
the
man
was
still
breathing
he
was
conveyed
on
board
the
where
it
was
learned
from
the
that
he
was
simon
hart
for
some
time
his
life
was
despaired
of
but
he
was
eventually
brought
round
and
from
the
answers
made
to
the
questions
addressed
to
him
the
following
conclusion
was
reached
moved
to
his
very
soul
at
the
sight
of
the
tricolor
flag
being
at
last
conscious
of
the
crime
of
he
was
about
to
commit
thomas
roch
rushed
through
the
passage
to
the
magazine
where
a
considerable
quantity
of
his
explosive
was
stored
then
before
he
could
be
prevented
brought
about
the
terrible
explosion
which
destroyed
the
island
of
back
cup
and
now
ker
karraje
and
his
pirates
have
disappeared
and
with
them
thomas
roch
and
the
secret
of
his
invention
the
end
end
of
the
voyage
extraordinaire
