billabong
norah
home
was
on
a
big
station
in
the
north
of
victoria
so
large
that
you
could
almost
in
her
own
phrase
ride
all
day
and
never
see
any
one
you
did
want
to
see
which
was
a
great
advantage
in
eyes
not
that
billabong
station
ever
seemed
to
the
little
girl
a
place
that
you
needed
to
praise
in
any
way
it
occupied
so
very
modest
a
position
as
the
loveliest
part
of
the
world
the
homestead
was
built
on
a
gentle
rise
that
sloped
gradually
away
on
every
side
in
front
to
the
wide
plain
dotted
with
huge
gum
trees
and
great
grey
box
groves
and
at
the
back
after
you
had
passed
through
the
vegetable
garden
and
orchard
to
a
long
lagoon
bordered
with
trees
and
fringed
with
tall
bulrushes
and
waving
reeds
the
house
itself
was
old
and
quaint
and
rambling
part
of
the
old
wattle
and
dab
walls
yet
remaining
in
some
of
the
outhouses
as
well
as
the
grey
shingle
roof
there
was
a
more
modern
part
for
the
house
had
been
added
to
from
time
to
time
by
different
owners
though
no
additions
had
been
made
since
norah
father
brought
home
his
young
wife
fifteen
years
before
this
story
opens
then
he
had
built
a
large
new
wing
with
wide
and
lofty
rooms
and
round
all
had
put
a
very
broad
tiled
verandah
the
creepers
had
had
time
to
twine
round
the
massive
posts
in
those
fifteen
years
and
some
even
lay
in
great
masses
on
the
verandah
roof
tecoma
pink
and
purple
bougainvillea
and
the
snowy
mandevillea
clusters
people
said
this
was
not
good
for
the
building
but
norah
mother
had
planted
them
and
because
she
had
loved
them
they
were
never
touched
there
was
a
huge
front
garden
not
at
all
a
proper
kind
of
garden
but
a
great
stretch
of
smooth
buffalo
grass
dotted
with
all
kinds
of
trees
amongst
which
flower
beds
cropped
up
in
most
unexpected
and
unlikely
places
just
as
if
some
giant
had
flung
them
out
on
the
grass
like
a
handful
of
pebbles
that
scattered
as
they
flew
they
were
always
trim
and
tidy
and
the
gardener
hogg
was
terribly
strict
and
woe
betide
the
author
of
any
small
footmarks
that
he
found
on
one
of
the
freshly
raked
surfaces
nothing
annoyed
him
more
than
the
odd
bulbs
that
used
to
come
up
in
the
midst
of
his
precious
buffalo
grass
impertinent
crocuses
and
daffodils
and
hyacinths
that
certainly
had
no
right
there
blest
if
i
know
how
they
ever
gets
there
hogg
would
say
scratching
his
head
whereat
norah
was
wont
to
retire
behind
a
pyramid
tree
for
purposes
of
mirth
hogg
sworn
foe
was
lee
wing
the
chinese
gardener
who
reigned
supreme
in
the
orchard
and
the
kingdom
of
vegetables
not
quite
the
same
thing
as
the
vegetable
kingdom
by
the
way
lee
wing
was
very
fat
his
broad
yellow
face
generally
wearing
a
cheerful
grin
unless
he
happened
to
catch
sight
of
hogg
his
long
pigtail
was
always
concealed
under
his
flapping
straw
hat
once
jim
who
was
norah
big
brother
had
found
him
asleep
in
his
hut
with
the
pigtail
drooping
over
the
edge
of
the
bunk
jim
thought
the
opportunity
too
good
to
lose
and
with
such
deftness
that
the
celestial
never
stirred
he
tied
the
end
of
the
pigtail
to
the
back
of
a
chair
with
rather
startling
results
when
lee
wing
awoke
with
a
sudden
sense
of
being
late
and
made
a
spring
from
the
bunk
the
chair
of
course
followed
him
and
the
loud
yell
of
fear
and
pain
raised
by
the
victim
brought
half
the
homestead
to
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe
jim
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
wait
for
developments
he
found
business
at
the
lagoon
the
queerest
part
of
it
was
that
lee
wing
firmly
believed
hogg
to
be
the
author
of
his
woe
nothing
moved
him
from
this
view
not
even
when
jim
finding
how
matters
stood
owned
up
like
a
man
you
allee
same
boy
said
the
pigtailed
one
proffering
him
a
succulent
raw
turnip
me
know
you
tellee
fine
large
crammee
hogg
he
tellee
crammee
too
so
dly
up
and
jim
finding
expostulation
useless
dried
up
accordingly
and
ate
the
turnip
which
was
better
than
the
leek
to
the
right
of
the
homestead
at
billabong
a
clump
of
box
trees
sheltered
the
stables
that
were
the
unspoken
pride
of
heart
before
his
time
the
stables
had
been
a
conglomerate
mass
falling
to
decay
added
to
as
each
successive
owner
had
thought
fit
with
a
final
mixture
of
old
and
new
that
was
neither
convenient
nor
beautiful
linton
had
apologised
to
his
horses
during
his
first
week
of
occupancy
and
in
the
second
turning
them
out
to
grass
with
less
apology
had
pulled
down
the
rickety
old
sheds
replacing
them
with
a
compact
and
handsome
building
of
red
brick
with
room
for
half
a
dozen
buggies
men
quarters
harness
and
feed
rooms
many
loose
boxes
and
a
loft
where
a
ball
could
have
been
held
and
where
indeed
many
a
one
was
held
when
all
the
young
farmers
and
stockmen
and
shearers
from
far
and
near
brought
each
his
lass
and
tripped
it
from
early
night
to
early
dawn
to
the
strains
of
old
andy
ferguson
fiddle
and
young
dave
boone
concertina
norah
had
been
allowed
to
look
on
at
one
or
two
of
these
gatherings
she
thought
them
the
height
of
human
bliss
and
was
only
sorry
that
sheer
inability
to
dance
prevented
her
from
taking
the
floor
with
mick
shanahan
the
horse
breaker
who
had
paid
her
the
compliment
of
asking
her
first
it
was
a
great
compliment
too
norah
felt
seeing
what
a
man
of
agility
and
splendid
accomplishments
was
mick
and
that
she
was
only
nine
at
the
time
there
was
one
loose
box
which
was
norah
very
own
property
and
without
her
permission
no
horse
was
ever
put
in
it
except
its
rightful
occupant
bobs
whose
name
was
proudly
displayed
over
the
door
in
best
carving
bobs
had
always
belonged
to
norah
he
had
been
given
to
her
as
a
foal
when
norah
used
to
ride
a
round
little
black
sheltie
as
easy
to
fall
off
as
to
mount
he
was
a
beauty
even
then
norah
thought
and
her
father
had
looked
approvingly
at
the
baby
with
his
fine
head
you
will
have
something
worth
riding
when
that
fellow
is
fit
to
break
in
my
girlie
he
had
said
and
his
prophecy
had
been
amply
fulfilled
mick
shanahan
said
he
never
put
a
leg
over
a
finer
pony
norah
knew
there
never
had
been
a
finer
anywhere
he
was
a
big
pony
very
dark
bay
in
colour
and
as
handsome
as
paint
and
with
the
kindest
disposition
full
of
life
and
go
but
without
the
smallest
particle
of
vice
it
was
an
even
question
which
loved
the
other
best
bobs
or
norah
no
one
ever
rode
him
except
his
little
mistress
the
pair
were
hard
to
beat
so
the
men
said
to
norah
the
stables
were
the
heart
of
billabong
the
house
was
all
very
well
of
course
she
loved
it
and
she
loved
her
own
little
room
with
its
red
carpet
and
dainty
white
furniture
and
the
two
long
windows
that
looked
out
over
the
green
plain
that
was
all
right
so
were
the
garden
and
the
big
orchard
especially
in
summer
time
the
only
part
that
was
not
all
right
was
the
an
apartment
of
gloomy
splendour
that
norah
hated
with
her
whole
heart
but
the
stables
were
an
abiding
refuge
she
was
never
dull
there
apart
from
the
welcome
in
bobs
loose
box
there
was
the
dim
fragrant
loft
where
the
sunbeams
only
managed
to
send
dusty
rays
of
light
across
the
gloom
here
norah
used
to
lie
on
the
sweet
hay
and
think
tremendous
thoughts
here
also
she
laid
deep
plans
for
catching
rats
and
caught
scores
in
traps
of
her
own
devising
norah
hated
rats
but
nothing
could
induce
her
to
wage
war
against
the
mice
poor
little
chaps
she
said
they
so
little
and
and
soft
and
she
was
quite
saddened
if
by
chance
she
found
a
stray
mouse
in
any
of
her
traps
for
the
benefit
of
the
larger
game
which
infested
the
stables
and
had
even
the
hardihood
to
annoy
bobs
norah
had
never
known
her
mother
she
was
only
a
tiny
baby
when
that
gay
little
mother
died
a
sudden
terrible
blow
that
changed
her
father
in
a
night
from
a
young
man
to
an
old
one
it
was
nearly
twelve
years
ago
now
but
no
one
ever
dared
to
speak
to
david
linton
of
his
wife
sometimes
norah
used
to
ask
jim
about
mother
for
jim
was
fifteen
and
could
remember
just
a
little
but
his
memories
were
so
vague
and
misty
that
his
information
was
unsatisfactory
and
after
all
norah
did
not
trouble
much
she
had
always
been
so
happy
that
she
could
not
imagine
that
to
have
had
a
mother
would
have
made
any
particular
difference
to
her
happiness
you
see
she
did
not
know
she
had
grown
just
as
the
bush
wild
flowers
grow
hardy
unchecked
almost
untended
for
though
old
nurse
had
always
been
there
her
nurseling
had
gone
her
own
way
from
the
time
she
could
toddle
she
was
everybody
pet
and
plaything
the
only
being
who
had
power
to
make
her
stern
silent
father
smile
almost
the
only
one
who
ever
saw
the
softer
side
of
his
character
he
was
fond
and
proud
of
jim
glad
that
the
boy
was
growing
up
straight
and
strong
and
manly
able
to
make
his
way
in
the
world
but
norah
was
his
heart
desire
of
course
she
was
spoilt
if
spoiling
consists
in
rarely
checking
an
impulse
all
her
life
norah
had
done
pretty
well
whatever
she
wanted
which
meant
that
she
had
lived
out
of
doors
followed
in
footsteps
wherever
practicable
and
in
a
good
many
ways
most
people
would
have
thought
distinctly
impracticable
and
spent
about
of
her
waking
time
on
horseback
but
the
spoiling
was
not
of
a
very
harmful
kind
her
chosen
pursuits
brought
her
under
the
unspoken
discipline
of
the
work
of
the
station
wherein
ordinary
instinct
taught
her
to
do
as
others
did
and
conform
to
their
ways
she
had
all
the
dread
of
being
thought
silly
that
marks
the
girl
who
imitates
boyish
ways
jim
rare
growl
have
a
little
sense
went
farther
home
than
a
whole
volume
of
admonitions
of
a
more
ordinarily
genuine
feminine
type
she
had
no
little
girl
friends
for
none
was
nearer
than
the
nearest
township
cunjee
seventeen
miles
away
moreover
little
girls
bored
norah
frightfully
they
seemed
a
species
quite
distinct
from
herself
they
prattled
of
dolls
they
loved
to
skip
to
dress
up
and
play
ladies
and
when
norah
spoke
of
the
superior
joys
of
cutting
out
cattle
or
coursing
hares
over
the
long
plain
they
stared
at
her
with
blank
lack
of
understanding
with
boys
she
got
on
much
better
jim
and
she
were
tremendous
chums
and
she
had
moped
sadly
when
he
went
to
melbourne
to
school
holidays
then
became
the
shining
events
of
the
year
and
the
boys
whom
jim
brought
home
with
him
at
first
prone
to
look
down
on
the
small
girl
with
lofty
condescension
generally
ended
by
voting
her
no
end
of
a
jolly
kid
and
according
her
the
respect
due
to
a
person
who
could
teach
them
more
of
bush
life
than
they
had
dreamed
of
but
norah
principal
mate
was
her
father
day
after
day
they
were
together
riding
over
the
run
working
the
cattle
walking
through
the
thick
scrub
of
the
backwater
driving
young
horses
in
the
high
to
cunjee
they
were
rarely
apart
david
linton
seldom
made
a
plan
that
did
not
naturally
include
norah
she
was
a
wise
little
companion
too
ready
enough
to
chatter
like
a
magpie
if
her
father
were
in
the
mood
but
quick
to
note
if
he
were
not
and
then
quite
content
to
be
silently
beside
him
perhaps
for
hours
they
understood
each
other
perfectly
norah
never
could
make
out
the
people
who
pitied
her
for
having
no
friends
of
her
own
age
how
could
she
possibly
be
bothered
with
children
she
reflected
when
she
had
daddy
as
for
norah
education
that
was
of
the
kind
best
defined
as
a
minus
quantity
i
wo
have
her
bothered
with
books
too
early
linton
had
said
when
nurse
hinted
on
norah
eight
birthday
that
it
was
time
she
began
the
rudiments
of
learning
time
enough
yet
we
do
want
to
make
a
bookworm
of
her
whereat
nurse
smiled
demurely
knowing
that
that
was
the
last
thing
to
be
afraid
of
in
connexion
with
her
child
but
she
worried
in
her
responsible
old
soul
all
the
same
and
when
a
wet
day
or
the
occasional
absence
of
linton
left
norah
without
occupation
she
induced
her
to
begin
a
few
elementary
lessons
the
child
was
quick
enough
and
soon
learned
to
read
fairly
well
and
to
write
laboriously
but
there
teaching
from
books
ended
of
other
and
practical
teaching
however
she
had
a
greater
store
linton
had
a
strong
leaning
towards
the
virtues
and
it
was
at
a
word
from
him
that
norah
had
gone
to
the
kitchen
and
asked
brown
to
teach
her
to
cook
brown
fat
and
adoring
was
all
acquiescence
and
by
the
time
norah
was
eleven
she
knew
more
of
cooking
and
general
housekeeping
than
many
girls
grown
up
and
fancying
themselves
ready
to
undertake
houses
of
their
own
moreover
she
could
sew
rather
well
though
she
frankly
detested
the
accomplishment
the
one
form
of
work
she
cared
for
was
knitting
and
it
was
her
boast
that
her
father
wore
only
the
socks
she
manufactured
for
him
norah
one
gentle
passion
was
music
never
taught
she
inherited
from
her
mother
a
natural
instinct
and
an
absolutely
true
ear
and
before
she
was
seven
she
could
strum
on
the
old
piano
in
a
way
very
satisfying
to
herself
and
to
the
admiring
nurse
her
talent
increased
yearly
and
at
ten
she
could
play
anything
she
heard
from
ear
for
she
had
never
been
taught
a
note
of
music
it
was
indeed
her
growing
capabilities
in
this
respect
that
forced
upon
her
father
the
need
for
proper
tuition
for
the
child
however
a
stopgap
was
found
in
the
person
of
the
a
young
englishman
who
knew
more
of
music
than
accounts
he
readily
undertook
norah
instruction
and
the
lessons
bore
moderately
good
effect
the
moderation
being
due
to
a
not
unnatural
disinclination
on
the
pupil
part
to
walk
where
she
had
been
accustomed
to
run
and
to
a
fixed
loathing
to
practice
as
the
latter
necessary
if
uninteresting
pursuit
was
left
entirely
to
her
own
discretion
for
no
one
ever
dreamed
of
ordering
norah
to
the
piano
it
is
small
wonder
if
it
suffered
beside
the
superior
attractions
of
riding
bobs
rat
trapping
shinning
up
trees
fishing
in
the
lagoon
and
generally
disporting
herself
as
a
maiden
may
whom
conventional
restrictions
have
never
trammelled
it
follows
that
the
music
lessons
twice
a
week
were
times
of
woe
for
groom
the
teacher
he
was
an
earnest
young
man
with
a
sincere
desire
for
his
pupil
improvement
and
it
was
certainly
disheartening
to
find
on
friday
that
the
words
of
tuesday
had
apparently
gone
in
at
one
ear
and
out
at
the
other
simultaneously
sometimes
he
would
remonstrate
you
have
got
on
with
that
piece
a
bit
what
the
good
the
pupil
would
remark
twisting
round
on
the
music

that
his
opportunity
was
vanishing
norah
come
back
if
i
to
go
out
you
must
play
this
first
and
get
it
groom
could
be
firm
on
occasions
come
along
you
little
shirker
and
norah
would
unwillingly
return
to
the
music
stool
and
worry
laboriously
though
a
page
of
the
hated
czerny
chapter
ii
pets
and
playthings
after
her
father
norah
chief
companions
were
her
pets
these
were
a
numerous
and
varied
band
and
required
no
small
amount
of
attention
bobs
of
course
came
first
no
other
animal
could
possibly
approach
him
in
favour
but
after
bobs
came
a
long
procession
beginning
with
tait
the
collie
and
ending
with
the
last
brood
of
fluffy
orpington
chicks
or
perhaps
the
newest
thing
in
disabled
birds
picked
up
fluttering
and
helpless
in
the
yard
or
orchard
there
was
room
in
norah
heart
for
them
all
tait
was
a
beauty
a
collie
with
a
splendid
head
and
big
faithful
brown
eyes
that
spoke
more
eloquently
than
many
tongues
he
was
like
most
of
the
breed
ready
to
be
friends
with
any
one
but
his
little
mistress
was
dearest
of
all
and
he
worshipped
her
with
abject
devotion
norah
never
went
anywhere
without
him
tait
saw
to
that
he
seemed
always
on
the
watch
for
her
coming
and
she
was
never
more
than
a
few
yards
from
the
house
before
the
big
dog
was
silently
brushing
the
grass
by
her
side
his
greatest
joy
was
to
follow
her
on
long
rides
into
the
bush
putting
up
an
occasional
hare
and
scurrying
after
it
in
the
futile
way
of
collies
barking
at
the
swallows
overhead
and
keeping
pace
with
bobs
long
easy
canter
puck
used
to
come
on
these
excursions
too
he
was
the
only
being
for
whom
it
was
suspected
that
tait
felt
a
mild
dislike
an
impudent
irish
terrier
full
of
fun
and
mischief
yet
with
a
somewhat
unfriendly
and
suspicious
temperament
that
made
him
perhaps
a
better
guardian
for
norah
than
the
benevolently
disposed
tait
puck
had
a
nasty
inquiring
mind
an
unpleasant
way
of
sniffing
round
the
legs
of
tramps
that
generally
induced
those
gentry
to
find
the
top
rail
of
a
fence
a
more
calm
and
more
desirable
spot
than
the
level
of
the
ground
indian
hawkers
feared
him
and
hated
him
in
equal
measure
he
could
bite
and
occasionally
did
bite
his
victims
being
always
selected
with
judgment
and
discretion
generally
vagrants
emboldened
to
insolence
by
seeing
no
men
about
the
kitchen
when
all
hands
were
out
mustering
or
busy
on
the
run
when
puck
bit
it
was
with
no
uncertain
tooth
he
was
suspected
of
a
desire
to
taste
the
blood
of
every
one
who
went
near
norah
though
his
cannibalistic
propensities
were
curbed
by
stern
discipline
only
once
had
he
had
anything
like
a
free
hand
or
a
free
tooth
norah
was
out
riding
a
good
way
from
the
homestead
when
a
particularly
fellow
accosted
her
and
asked
for
money
norah
stared
i
have
got
any
she
said
anyhow
father
does
let
us
give
away
money
to
travellers
only
oh
does
he
the
fellow
said
unpleasantly
well
i
want
money
not
he
laid
a
compelling
hand
on
bobs
bridle
as
norah
tried
to
pass
him
come
he
said
that
bracelet
do
it
was
a
pretty
little
gold
watch
set
in
a
leather
bangle
birthday
present
only
a
few
weeks
old
norah
simply
laughed
she
scarcely
comprehended
so
amazing
a
thing
as
that
this
man
should
really
intend
to
rob
her
get
out
of
my
way
she
said
you
ca
have
that
ca
i
he
caught
her
wrist
give
it
quietly
now
or
i
the
sentence
was
not
completed
a
yellow
streak
hurled
itself
though
the
air
as
puck
who
had
been
investigating
a
tussock
for
lizards
awoke
to
the
situation
something
like
a
vice
gripped
the
swagman
by
the
leg
and
he
dropped
norah
wrist
and
bridle
and
roared
like
any
bull
the
something
hung
on
fiercely
silently
and
the
victim
hopped
and
raved
and
begged
for
mercy
norah
had
ridden
a
little
way
on
she
called
softly
to
puck
here
boy
puck
did
not
relinquish
his
grip
he
looked
pleadingly
at
his
little
mistress
across
the
swagman
norah
struck
her
saddle
sharply
with
her
whip
here
sir
drop
it
puck
dropped
it
reluctantly
and
came
across
to
bobs
his
head
hanging
the
swagman
sat
down
on
the
ground
and
nursed
his
leg
that
served
you
right
norah
said
with
judicial
severity
you
any
business
to
grab
my
watch
now
if
you
go
up
to
the
house
give
you
some
tucker
and
a
rag
for
your
leg
she
rode
off
whistling
to
puck
the
swagman
gaped
and
muttered
various
remarks
he
did
not
call
at
the
house
norah
was
supposed
to
manage
the
fowls
but
her
management
was
almost
entirely
ornamental
and
it
is
to
be
feared
that
the
poultry
yard
would
have
fared
but
poorly
had
it
depended
upon
her
alone
all
the
fowls
were
hers
she
said
so
and
no
one
contradicted
her
still
whenever
one
was
wanted
for
the
table
it
was
ruthlessly
slain
and
it
was
black
billy
who
fed
them
night
and
morning
and
brown
who
gathered
the
eggs
and
saw
that
the
houses
were
safely
shut
against
the
foxes
every
evening
norah
chief
part
in
the
management
lay
in
looking
after
the
setting
hens
at
first
she
firmly
checked
the
broody
instincts
by
shutting
them
callously
under
boxes
despite
pecks
and
loud
protests
later
when
their
mood
refused
to
change
she
loved
to
prepare
them
soft
nests
in
boxes
and
to
imprison
them
there
until
they
took
kindly
to
their
seclusion
then
it
was
hard
work
to
wait
three
weeks
until
the
first
fluffy
heads
peeped
out
from
the
angry
mother
wing
after
which
norah
was
a
blissfully
adoring
caretaker
until
the
downy
balls
began
to
get
ragged
as
the
first
wing
and
tail
feathers
showed
then
the
chicks
became
uninteresting
and
were
handed
over
to
black
billy
besides
her
own
pets
there
were
jim
mind
they
in
your
care
jim
had
said
sternly
on
the
evening
before
his
departure
for
school
they
were
making
a
tour
of
the
place
jim
outwardly
very
cheerful
and
unconcerned
norah
plunged
in
woe
she
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
it
she
had
taken
jim
arm
and
it
was
sufficient
proof
of
his
state
of
mind
that
he
did
not
shake
it
off
indeed
the
indications
were
that
he
was
glad
of
the
loving
little
hand
tucked
into
the
bend
of
his
arm
yes
jim
i
look
after
i
do
want
you
to
bother
feeding
them
yourself
jim
said
magnanimously
that
be
rather
too
much
of
a
contract
for
a
kid
would
it
only
keep
an
eye
on
and
round
up
billy
if
he
do
his
work
he
a
terror
if
he
shirks
and
unless
you
watch
him
like
a
cat
he
never
change
the
water
in
the
tins
every
morning
lots
of
times
i
had
to
do
it
myself
i
do
it
myself
let
them
go
without
jim
dear
said
the
small
voice
with
a
suspicion
of
a
choke
do
you
do
it
said
jim
slang
billy
what
he
here
for
i
like
to
know
i
only
want
you
to
go
round
every
day
and
see
that
all
so
daily
norah
used
to
make
her
pilgrimage
round
jim
pets
there
were
the
guinea
pigs
a
rapidly
increasing
band
in
an
enclosure
specially
built
for
them
by
jim
a
light
frame
netted
carefully
everywhere
and
so
constructed
that
it
could
be
moved
from
place
to
place
giving
them
a
fresh
grass
run
continually
then
there
were
two
young
wallabies
and
a
little
brush
kangaroo
which
lived
in
a
little
paddock
all
their
own
and
were
as
tame
as
kittens
norah
loved
this
trio
especially
and
always
had
a
game
with
them
on
her
daily
visit
there
was
a
shy
gentleman
which
norah
called
a
turloise
because
she
never
could
remember
if
he
were
a
turtle
or
a
tortoise
he
lived
in
a
small
enclosure
with
a
tiny
water
hole
and
his
disposition
was
extremely
retiring
in
private
norah
did
not
feel
drawn
to
this
member
of
her
charge
but
she
paid
him
double
attention
from
an
inward
feeling
of
guilt
and
because
jim
set
a
high
value
upon
him
he
such
a
wise
old
chap
jim
would
say
nobody
knows
what
thinking
of
in
her
heart
of
hearts
norah
did
not
believe
that
mattered
very
much
but
when
the
stables
had
been
visited
and
bobs
and
sirdar
neglected
pony
interviewed
when
tait
and
puck
had
had
their
breakfast
bones
when
wallabies
and
kangaroo
had
been
inspected
with
a
critical
eye
to
their
water
tins
and
the
turtle
had
impassively
received
a
praiseworthy
attempt
to
draw
him
out
when
the
chicks
had
all
been
fed
and
the
guinea
pigs
unlike
the
leopard
had
changed
their
spot
for
the
day
there
still
remained
the
birds
the
birds
were
a
colony
in
themselves
there
was
a
big
aviary
large
enough
for
little
trees
and
big
shrubs
to
grow
in
where
a
happy
family
lived
whose
members
included
several
kinds
of
queensland
finches
blackbirds
and
a
dozen
other
tiny
shy
things
which
flitted
quickly
from
bush
to
bush
all
day
they
knew
norah
and
when
she
entered
their
home
would
flutter
down
and
perch
on
her
head
and
shoulders
and
look
inquisitively
for
the
flowers
she
always
brought
them
sometimes
norah
would
wear
some
artificial
flowers
by
way
of
a
joke
it
was
funny
to
see
the
little
thrusting
in
their
long
beaks
again
and
again
in
search
of
the
sweet
drops
they
had
learned
to
expect
in
flowers
and
funnier
still
to
watch
the
air
of
disgust
with
which
they
would
give
up
the
attempt
there
were
doves
everywhere
not
in
cages
for
they
never
tried
to
escape
their
soft
coo
murmured
drowsily
all
around
there
were
pigeons
too
in
a
most
elaborate
pigeon
cote
another
effort
of
carpentering
skill
these
were
as
tame
as
the
smaller
birds
and
on
norah
appearance
would
swoop
down
upon
her
in
a
cloud
they
had
done
so
once
when
she
was
mounted
on
bobs
to
the
pony
very
great
alarm
and
disgust
he
took
to
his
heels
promptly
i
do
think
he
stopped
for
two
miles
norah
said
since
then
however
bobs
had
grown
used
to
the
pigeons
fluttering
and
circling
round
him
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
watch
them
all
together
child
and
pony
half
hidden
beneath
their
load
of
birds
the
canaries
had
a
cage
to
themselves
a
very
smart
one
with
every
device
for
making
canary
life
endurable
in
captivity
certainly
birds
seemed
happy
enough
and
the
sweet
songs
of
the
canaries
were
delightful
i
think
they
were
norah
favourites
amongst
her
feathered
flock
finally
there
were
two
talkative
members
fudge
the
parrot
and
old
caesar
a
very
fine
white
cockatoo
fudge
had
been
caught
young
and
his
education
had
been
of
a
liberal
order
an
apt
pupil
he
had
picked
up
various
items
of
knowledge
and
had
blended
them
into
a
whole
that
was
scarcely
harmonious
bits
of
slang
learned
from
jim
and
the
stockmen
were
mingled
with
fragments
of
hymns
warbled
by
brown
and
sharp
curt
orders
delivered
to
dogs
a
french
who
had
hurt
his
foot
and
been
obliged
to
camp
for
a
few
days
at
the
homestead
supplied
fudge
with
several
parisian
remarks
that
were
very
effective
every
member
of
the
household
had
tried
to
teach
him
to
whistle
some
special
tune
unfortunately
the
lessons
had
been
delivered
at
the
same
time
and
the
result
was
the
most
amazing
jumble
of
melody
which
fudge
delivered
with
an
air
of
deepest
satisfaction
as
jim
said
you
never
know
if
whistling
save
the
king
goes
the
weasel
or
wearin
the
green
but
it
does
make
any
difference
to
fudge
enjoyment
caesar
was
a
giant
among
cockatoos
and
had
a
full
sense
of
his
own
importance
he
had
been
shot
when
very
young
some
stray
pellets
having
found
their
way
into
his
wing
norah
had
found
him
fluttering
helplessly
along
the
ground
and
had
picked
him
up
sustaining
a
severe
peck
in
doing
so
it
was
however
the
first
and
last
peck
he
ever
gave
norah
from
that
moment
he
seemed
to
recognize
her
as
a
friend
and
to
adopt
her
as
an
intimate
marks
of
esteem
he
accorded
to
very
few
others
norah
had
handed
him
to
jim
on
arriving
at
the
house
a
change
which
the
bird
resented
by
a
savage
attack
on
jim
thumb
jim
was
no
hero
at
the
age
of
eleven
he
dropped
the
cockatoo
like
a
hot
coal
great
caesar
he
exclaimed
sucking
his
thumb
and
caesar
he
was
christened
in
that
moment
after
his
recovery
which
was
a
long
and
tedious
process
caesar
showed
no
inclination
to
leave
the
homestead
he
used
to
strut
about
the
back
yard
and
frequent
the
kitchen
door
very
much
after
the
fashion
of
a
he
was
indeed
as
valuable
as
a
for
the
appearance
of
any
stranger
was
the
signal
for
a
volley
of
shrieks
and
chatter
sufficient
to
alarm
any
household
however
caesar
liberty
had
to
be
restricted
for
he
became
somewhat
of
a
menace
to
all
he
did
not
choose
to
care
for
and
his
attacks
on
the
ankles
were
no
joking
matter
to
the
dogs
he
was
a
constant
terror
he
hated
all
alike
and
would
go
for
big
tait
as
readily
as
for
cheerful
little
puck
and
not
a
dog
on
the
place
would
face
him
so
at
last
a
stand
and
a
chain
were
bought
for
caesar
and
on
his
perch
he
lived
in
solitary
splendour
while
his
enemies
took
good
care
to
keep
beyond
his
reach
norah
he
always
loved
and
those
whom
he
had
managed
to
bite
their
number
was
large
used
to
experience
thrills
on
seeing
the
little
girl
hold
him
close
to
her
face
while
he
rubbed
his
beak
up
and
down
her
cheek
he
tolerated
black
billy
who
fed
him
and
was
respectful
to
linton
but
he
worshipped
brown
the
cook
and
her
appearance
at
the
kitchen
door
which
he
could
see
from
his
stand
caused
an
instant
outbreak
of
cheers
and
chatter
varied
by
touching
appeals
to
scratch
his
chief
foe
was
brown
big
yellow
cat
who
not
only
dared
to
share
the
adored
one
affections
but
was
openly
aggressive
at
times
and
loved
to
steal
the
cockatoo
food
caesar
on
his
perch
apparently
wrapped
in
dreamless
slumber
would
in
reality
be
watching
the
stealthy
movements
of
tim
the
cat
who
would
come
scouting
through
the
grass
towards
the
tin
of
food
just
out
of
reach
tim
would
lie
down
and
feign
sleep
as
deep
as
caesar
though
every
muscle
in
his
body
was
tense
with
readiness
for
the
sudden
spring
so
they
would
remain
perhaps
many
minutes
tim
patience
never
gave
out
sometimes
caesar
would
and
he
would
open
his
eyes
and
flap
round
on
his
perch
shouting
much
bad
bird
language
at
the
retreating
tim
but
more
often
both
remained
motionless
until
the
cat
sprang
suddenly
at
the
food
tin
more
often
than
not
he
was
too
quick
for
caesar
and
would
drag
the
tin
beyond
reach
of
the
chain
before
the
bird
could
defend
it
in
which
case
the
wrath
of
the
defeated
was
awful
to
behold
but
sometimes
caesar
managed
to
anticipate
the
leap
and
tim
did
not
readily
forget
those
distressful
moments
when
the
cockatoo
had
him
by
the
fur
with
beak
and
claw
he
would
escape
showing
several
patches
where
his
coat
had
been
torn
and
remained
in
a
state
of
dejection
for
two
or
three
days
during
which
battles
were
discontinued
it
took
caesar
almost
as
long
to
recover
from
the
wild
state
of
triumph
into
which
his
rare
victories
threw
him
chapter
iii
a
menagerie
race
the
first
time
that
jim
returned
from
school
was
for
the
easter
holidays
he
brought
a
couple
of
mates
with
him
boys
from
new
south
wales
and
queensland
harry
trevor
and
walter
meadows
harry
was
a
little
older
than
jim
a
short
lad
very
fair
and
solemn
with
expressionless
grey
eyes
looking
out
beneath
a
shock
of
flaxen
hair
those
who
knew
him
not
said
that
he
was
stupid
those
who
knew
him
said
that
you
could
tell
old
harry
much
that
he
did
know
those
who
knew
him
very
well
said
that
you
could
depend
on
trevor
to
his
last
gasp
jim
loved
him
and
there
were
few
people
jim
loved
walter
or
wally
meadows
was
a
different
type
long
and
thin
for
fourteen
burnt
to
almost
kaffir
darkness
a
wag
of
a
boy
with
merry
brown
eyes
and
a
temperament
unable
to
be
depressed
for
more
than
five
minutes
at
a
time
he
was
always
in
scrapes
at
school
but
a
great
favourite
with
masters
and
boys
notwithstanding
and
he
straightway
laid
his
boyish
heart
down
at
norah
feet
and
was
her
slave
from
the
first
day
they
met
norah
liked
them
both
she
had
been
desperately
afraid
that
they
would
try
to
take
jim
away
from
her
and
was
much
relieved
to
find
that
they
welcomed
her
cheerfully
into
their
plans
they
were
good
riders
and
the
four
had
splendid
gallops
over
the
plains
after
hares
also
they
admired
bobs
fervently
and
that
was
always
a
passport
to
norah
heart
it
was
on
the
third
day
of
their
visit
and
they
were
making
the
morning
round
of
the
pets
when
a
brilliant
idea
came
to
wally
let
have
a
menagerie
race
he
cried
suddenly
what
that
norah
asked
blankly
why
you
each
drive
an
animal
explained
wally
the
words
tumbling
over
one
another
in
his
haste
say
you
drive
the
kangaroo
me
the
wallabies
jim
the
orpington
rooster
we
give
old
harry
the
tortoise
turloise
i
beg
pardon
thanks
said
harry
dryly
the
tortoise
scored
once
you
know
young
wally
well
old
man
you
take
him
wally
said
kindly
would
stand
in
your
way
for
a
moment
we
can
use
harness
ca
we
do
know
jim
said
i
never
studied
the
rules
of
menagerie
racing
use
bridles
anyhow
it
a
good
idea
i
think
let
see
how
many
starters
we
can
they
cruised
round
dogs
were
barred
as
being
too
intelligent
horses
were
of
course
out
of
the
question
finally
they
fixed
on
the
possible
candidates
they
were
the
kangaroo
the
wallabies
a
big
black
orpington
rooster
fudge
the
parrot
caesar
the
cockatoo
brown
big
yellow
cat
tim
and
the
eight
said
harry
laconically
the
starters
were
all
mustered
in
one
enclosure
and
were
on
the
worst
of
terms
we
need
more
jockeys
if
you
call
well
there
black
billy
jim
said
he
available
and
he
drive
whichever
he
told
and
that
a
comfort
that
five
and
we
rouse
out
old
lee
wing
and
hogg
that
a
ripping
idea
they
hate
each
other
so
seven
who
eight
oh
i
know
we
get
brown
was
accordingly
bearded
in
her
den
and
protesting
vigorously
that
she
had
no
mind
for
racing
haled
forth
into
the
open
she
was
a
huge
woman
as
as
she
was
fat
which
said
a
good
deal
in
her
print
dress
with
enormous
white
apron
and
flapping
sun
bonnet
she
looked
as
unlikely
a
jockey
as
could
be
imagined
lee
wing
discovered
in
the
onion
bed
was
presently
brought
to
the
scratch
despite
his
protests
he
said
he
could
lun
but
was
told
that
in
all
probability
no
running
would
be
required
of
him
he
also
said
no
can
dlive
many
times
and
further
remarked
allee
same
gleat
when
he
saw
his
arch
enemy
hogg
among
the
competitors
his
resentment
was
keen
and
wally
was
told
off
to
restrain
him
from
flight
wally
own
idea
was
to
tie
him
up
by
the
pigtail
but
this
jim
was
prudent
enough
to
forbid
hogg
was
as
jim
put
it
rooting
amongst
the
roses
and
grunted
freely
on
his
way
to
the
post
he
could
never
refuse
norah
anything
but
this
proceeding
was
much
beneath
his
dignity
and
the
sight
of
lee
wing
did
not
tend
to
improve
his
view
of
the
matter
he
stood
aloof
with
a
cold
proud
smile
like
a
hero
of
melodrama
black
billy
was
of
course
in
the
stables
and
came
with
alacrity
he
had
not
much
english
and
that
little
was
broken
but
he
worshipped
the
linton
children
jim
especially
and
would
obey
him
with
the
unquestioning
obedience
of
a
dog
all
here
asked
jim
looking
round
five
six
eight
that
all
serene
now
who
going
to
drive
who
opinions
on
that
point
were
mixed
every
one
wanted
the
kangaroo
and
at
last
a
general
vote
gave
him
to
norah
wally
chose
one
wallaby
he
said
it
was
only
natural
and
made
a
further
remark
about
the
feelings
of
the
others
when
wally
and
his
wallaby
should
wallow
by
them
that
was
happily
quenched
by
harry
who
adopted
the
simple
plan
of
sitting
on
the
orator
harry
secured
the
second
wallaby
and
black
billy
was
given
the
orpington
rooster
as
his
steed
brown
from
the
first
applied
for
the
tortoise
she
said
it
meant
less
exertion
and
she
preferred
to
be
slow
and
sure
without
any
risk
of
hogg
chose
the
yellow
cat
tim
and
lee
wing
was
given
caesar
the
cockatoo
leaving
old
fudge
for
me
jim
said
ruefully
what
sort
of
a
chance
do
you
think
i
got
never
mind
i
used
to
being
good
for
you
observed
harry
now
how
about
harness
well
we
leave
that
to
individual
taste
jim
said
here
a
ball
of
string
and
there
are
plenty
of
light
straps
brown
you
the
leading
lady
how
shall
i
harness
your
prancing
steed
for
you
you
will
have
your
joke
master
jim
retorted
brown
bridling
and
beaming
now
i
do
think
i
harness
my
poor
beastie
at
all
give
me
a
couple
of
sticks
to
keep
his
head
the
right
way
and
to
poke
him
gently
and
we
beat
you
all
yet
norah
and
the
two
boys
fixed
up
fearful
and
wonderful
harness
for
their
nominations
collars
of
straps
and
long
string
headpieces
and
reins
the
animals
objected
strongly
to
being
harnessed
and
the
process
was
most
entertaining
brown
was
particularly
appreciative
and
at
length
in
a
paroxysm
of
mirth
narrowly
escaped
sitting
down
on
the
tortoise
black
billy
harness
was
not
extensive
he
tied
a
string
round
the
black
orpington
leg
and
retired
to
the
stable
for
a
few
minutes
returning
with
a
bulging
pocket
the
contents
of
which
he
did
not
communicate
hogg
did
not
attempt
to
bit
and
bridle
the
yellow
cat
which
was
much
annoyed
at
the
whole
proceeding
instead
he
fixed
up
a
collar
and
traces
of
string
and
chose
a
long
cane
more
he
said
for
purposes
of
defence
than
for
anything
else
lee
wing
and
jim
harnessed
their
steeds
in
the
same
way
with
a
long
string
tied
to
each
leg
all
ready
jim
queried
toe
the
line
the
course
was
across
a
small
paddock
near
the
house
a
distance
of
about
thirty
yards
and
the
competitors
were
ranged
up
with
no
little
difficulty
luckily
the
line
was
a
wide
one
admitting
of
considerable
space
between
each
starter
or
the
might
have
been
inextricably
confused
however
they
were
all
arranged
at
last
and
jim
in
a
stentorian
voice
gave
the
word
to
as
the
signal
was
given
the
drivers
urged
on
their
steeds
according
to
their
judgment
and
with
magnificent
results
first
to
get
off
the
line
were
the
wallabies
and
the
kangaroo
they
fled
each
his
several
way
and
after
them
went
their
drivers
in
great
haste
the
kangaroo
had
all
the
best
of
the
start
so
remarkable
was
his
bound
that
he
twitched
his
reins
quite
out
of
norah
hands
and
made
for
the
fence
of
the
paddock
it
was
an
open
one
which
let
him
through
easily
the
wallabies
seeing
his
shining
success
followed
his
course
and
midway
managed
to
entangle
their
reins
at
which
wally
and
harry
were
wildly
hauling
confusion
became
disorder
and
the
wallabies
at
length
reduced
themselves
to
a
tangle
out
of
which
they
had
to
be
assisted
by
means
of
harry
pocket
knife
jim
had
no
luck
the
parrot
went
off
well
but
very
soon
seemed
to
regret
his
rashness
and
despite
all
jim
endeavours
returned
with
solemnity
to
the
start
where
he
paused
and
talked
fluently
in
the
mixed
language
that
was
all
his
own
in
desperation
jim
tried
to
pull
him
along
but
fudge
simply
walked
round
and
round
him
until
he
had
exhausted
his
driver
patience
and
was
turned
the
most
spirited
of
the
competitors
were
decidedly
the
cockatoo
and
tim
they
were
panting
for
each
other
blood
from
the
start
and
before
they
had
been
urged
over
a
quarter
of
the
way
they
found
an
opportunity
of
warfare
and
seized
it
simultaneously
then
the
air
grew
murky
with
sound
cockatoo
shrieks
mingled
with
cat
calls
and
fluent
chinese
cutting
across
hogg
good
broad
scots
naturally
the
strings
of
the
harness
became
fatally
twisted
immediately
and
soon
the
combatants
were
bound
together
with
a
firmness
which
not
all
the
efforts
of
their
drivers
could
undo
a
sudden
movement
of
the
pair
made
lee
wing
spring
back
hastily
whereupon
he
tripped
and
stumbled
violently
against
hogg
hogg
temper
was
at
vanishing
point
and
this
was
the
last
straw
ye
image
he
exclaimed
furiously
drawing
back
he
aimed
a
blow
at
lee
wing
which
would
have
effectively
put
that
gentle
mongolian
out
of
the
race
had
he
not
dodged
quickly
he
shouted
something
in
his
own
language
which
was
evidently
of
no
complimentary
nature
and
hurled
himself
like
a
yellow
tornado
upon
the
angry
scotsman
they
struck
out
at
each
other
with
all
possible
but
their
science
was
much
impeded
by
the
fact
that
the
cat
and
cockatoo
were
fighting
fiercely
amongst
their
legs
finally
lee
wing
tripped
over
tim
and
sat
down
abruptly
receiving
as
he
did
so
an
impassioned
peck
from
caesar
which
elicited
from
him
a
loud
yell
of
anguish
hogg
attempting
to
follow
up
his
advantage
was
checked
suddenly
by
jim
who
left
his
parrot
to
its
own
devices
and
arrived
on
the
scene
at
full
gallop
you
are
a
blessed
pair
of
duffers
said
jim
wrathfully
look
here
if
father
catches
you
fighting
there
be
the
most
awful
row
and
i
be
in
it
too
what
worse
clear
out
for
goodness
sake
before
he
comes
along
and
do
get
in
each
others
road
again
and
each
nursing
bitterness
in
his
heart
the
rival
gardeners
returned
to
their
respective
beds
of
roses
and
onions
left
to
their
own
devices
the
yellow
cat
and
the
cockatoo
departed
also
in
a
turmoil
of
wrath
with
fur
and
feathers
flying
in
equal
proportions
eventually
tim
found
discretion
the
better
part
of
valour
and
scurried
away
to
the
safe
shelter
of
the
kitchen
pursued
by
caesar
with
loud
shrieks
of
defiance
and
victory
sounds
of
joyful
triumph
which
lasted
long
after
he
had
regained
his
perch
and
been
securely
fastened
by
the
leg
with
his
hated
chain
black
billy
meanwhile
had
paid
strict
attention
to
business
the
vagaries
of
wallabies
and
kangaroo
of
cat
and
parrot
and
cockatoo
had
no
attraction
for
the
dusky
leader
of
the
big
black
orpington
rooster
the
orpington
jonah
norah
called
him
was
not
inclined
to
race
he
had
tugged
furiously
at
his
leg
rope
with
much
outcry
and
indignation
until
billy
finding
himself
alone
owing
to
the
eccentric
behaviour
of
the
other
starters
had
resorted
to
different
tactics
by
no
means
devoid
of
native
cunning
slackening
the
line
he
suddenly
produced
from
his
pocket
a
few
grains
of
wheat
and
spread
them
temptingly
before
jonah
now
jonah
was
a
tame
bird
he
was
accustomed
to
being
handled
and
had
only
been
indignant
at
the
disgrace
of
bonds
this
new
departure
was
something
he
understood
so
he
gobbled
up
the
wheat
with
alacrity
and
looked
up
inquiringly
for
more
right
oh
said
bffly
retiring
a
few
steps
down
the
track
and
bringing
out
another
grain
jonah
sprang
after
it
and
then
was
dazzled
with
the
view
of
two
lying
yet
a
few
yards
farther
off
so
feeding
and
coaxing
black
billy
worked
his
unsuspecting
steed
across
the
little
paddock
no
one
was
near
when
he
reached
the
winning
post
to
which
he
promptly
tied
jonah
and
his
purpose
being
accomplished
and
no
need
of
further
bribery
being
necessary
sat
down
beside
him
and
meditatively
began
to
chew
the
remainder
of
his
wheat
jonah
looked
indignant
and
poked
round
after
more
grains
an
attention
which
billy
met
with
jeers
and
continued
heartless
mastication
until
the
orpington
gave
up
the
quest
in
disgust
and
retired
to
the
limit
of
his
tether
billy
sat
quietly
with
steadfast
glittering
eyes
twinkling
in
his
dusky
face
hallo
it
was
jim
voice
where
are
all
the
rest
mean
to
say
you
the
only
one
to
get
here
billy
grinned
silently
sounds
of
mirth
floated
over
the
grass
and
norah
harry
and
wally
raced
up
where
are
your
mokes
queried
jim
the
good
knights
are
dust
their
mokes
are
rust
misquoted
wally
cheerfully
we
do
know
bless
you
cleared
out
harness
and
all
we
have
a
wallaby
and
kangaroo
hunt
after
this
who
won
billy
said
jim
indicating
that
sable
hero
in
a
common
walk
fed
him
over
all
right
now
billy
you
kangaroo
wallaby
hear
billy
showed
a
set
of
amazingly
white
teeth
in
a
broad
grin
and
departed
swiftly
and
silently
where
lee
wing
had
to
tear
him
off
hogg
jim
grinned
you
never
saw
such
a
shindy
they
retired
in
bad
where
fudge
left
at
the
post
where
brown
and
the
tortoise
great
scott
jim
looked
round
blankly
that
never
occurred
to
me
where
is
she
i
wonder
the
course
was
empty
tortoise
got
away
with
her
laughed
wally
h
said
jim
we
track
her
to
her
in
her
lair
the
kitchen
brown
was
discovered
modestly
hiding
behind
the
door
the
tortoise
was
on
the
table
apparently
cheerful
poor
dear
pet
said
brown
he
would
run
i
do
think
he
was
awake
to
the
situation
master
jim
dear
so
i
just
carried
him
over
i
did
think
it
mattered
which
way
i
ran
and
my
scones
were
in
the
oven
they
just
out
perhaps
you
all
try
them
this
insinuatingly
i
do
think
this
tortoise
comes
of
a
racing
family
and
the
great
menagerie
race
concluded
happily
in
the
kitchen
in
what
wally
called
a
hot
buttered
chapter
iv
jim
idea
two
hammocks
side
by
side
under
a
huge
pine
tree
swung
lazily
to
and
fro
in
the
evening
breeze
in
them
norah
and
harry
rocked
happily
too
comfortable
as
norah
said
to
talk
they
had
all
been
out
riding
most
of
the
day
and
were
happily
tired
tea
had
been
discussed
fully
and
everything
was
exceedingly
peaceful
footsteps
at
racing
speed
sounded
far
off
on
the
gravel
of
the
front
path
a
wide
sweep
that
ran
round
the
broad
lawn
there
was
a
scatter
of
stones
and
then
a
over
the
grass
to
the
pine
trees
sounds
that
signalised
the
arrival
of
jim
and
wally
in
much
haste
jim
hurry
was
so
excessive
that
he
could
not
pull
himself
up
in
time
to
avoid
harry
he
bumped
violently
into
the
hammock
with
the
natural
result
that
harry
swung
sharply
against
norah
and
for
a
moment
things
were
rather
mixed
you
duffer
growled
harry
steadying
his
rocking
bed
hurt
you
this
to
norah
no
thanks
norah
laughed
what
the
matter
with
you
two
got
an
idea
wally
gasped
fanning
himself
with
a
pine
cone
hurt
you
rather
it
always
a
shock
for
me
to
have
an
idea
anyway
this
mine
it
norah
tone
was
more
respectful
jim
ideas
were
not
to
be
treated
lightly
as
a
rule
well
let
hear
fishing
jim
said
laconically
let
start
out
at
the
very
daybreak
and
get
up
the
river
to
anglers
bend
they
say
you
can
always
get
fish
there
we
ride
and
take
billy
to
carry
the
tucker
and
look
for
bait
spend
the
whole
blessed
day
and
come
home
with
the
mopokes
what
do
you
chaps
say
grand
idea
norah
cried
giving
her
hammock
an
ecstatic
swing
have
to
fly
round
though
did
you
ask
dad
yes
and
he
said
we
could
go
it
tucker
that
the
trouble
i
know
if
we
too
late
to
arrange
about
come
and
ask
brown
said
norah
flinging
a
pair
of
long
black
legs
over
the
edge
of
the
hammock
she
fix
us
up
if
she
they
tore
off
to
the
kitchen
and
arrived
panting
brown
was
sitting
in
calm
state
on
the
kitchen
verandah
and
greeted
them
with
a
wide
expansive
smile
norah
explained
their
need
brown
pursed
up
her
lips
i
have
anythink
fancy
my
dear
she
said
slowly
only
plum
cake
and
scones
and
there
a
nice
cold
tongue
and
an
apple
pie
i
like
you
to
have
tarts
but
the
fire
out
do
you
think
you
could
manage
jim
laughed
i
guess
that
do
brown
he
said
we
live
like
fighting
cocks
and
bring
you
home
any
amount
of
fish
for
breakfast
do
you
worry
about
sandwiches
either
put
in
a
loaf
or
two
of
bread
and
a
chunk
of
butter
and
we
be
right
as
then
i
have
it
all
packed
for
you
first
thing
master
jim
brown
declared
that
ripping
said
the
boys
in
a
breath
come
and
find
billy
was
dragged
from
the
recesses
of
the
stable
he
grinned
widely
with
joy
at
the
prospect
of
the
picnic
all
the
ponies
ready
at
five
billy
ordered
jim
yours
too
going
to
make
a
day
of
it
and
we
want
bait
now
you
chaps
come
along
and
get
lines
and
hooks
ready
the
alarm
clock
by
jim
bedside
shrieked
suddenly
in
the
first
hint
of
daylight
and
jim
sprang
from
his
pillow
with
the
alertness
of
a
and
grabbed
the
clock
to
stop
its
further
eloquence
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
and
yawned
tremendously
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
harry
slept
peacefully
nearer
wally
black
eyes
twinkled
for
a
moment
and
hurriedly
closed
apparently
in
deep
slumber
he
snored
softly
fraud
said
jim
with
emphasis
he
seized
his
pillow
and
hurled
it
vigorously
it
caught
wally
on
the
face
and
stayed
there
and
beneath
its
shelter
the
victim
still
snored
on
serenely
jim
rose
with
deliberation
and
seizing
the
bedclothes
gave
a
judicious
pull
which
ended
in
wally
suddenly
finding
himself
on
the
floor
he
clasped
wildly
at
the
blankets
but
they
were
dragged
from
his
reluctant
grasp
jim
toe
stirred
him
gently
and
at
length
he
rose
beast
he
said
miserably
what
on
earth
the
good
of
getting
up
at
this
hour
got
to
make
an
early
start
replied
his
host
come
and
stir
up
old
harry
was
noted
as
a
sleeper
pillows
hurled
on
top
of
him
were
as
nought
the
bedclothes
were
removed
but
he
turned
on
his
side
and
slumbered
like
a
little
child
and
to
think
wally
said
that
that
chap
springs
up
madly
when
the
bell
rings
once
at
school
school
was
never
like
this
jim
grinned
there
the
squirt
the
squirt
was
there
so
was
the
jug
of
water
and
a
moment
sufficed
to
charge
the
weapon
the
nozzle
was
gently
inserted
into
the
pyjama
collar
and
in
a
moment
the
drenched
and
wrathful
hero
arose
majestically
from
his
watery
pillow
and
seizing
his
tormentors
banged
their
heads
together
with
great
effort
you
slow
to
wake
but
no
end
of
a
terror
when
once
you
rouse
up
said
wally
ruefully
rubbing
his
pate
goats
said
harry
briefly
rubbing
his
neck
with
a
hard
towel
come
on
and
have
a
they
tore
down
the
hail
only
pausing
at
norah
door
while
jim
ran
in
to
wake
her
a
deed
speedily
accomplished
by
gently
and
firmly
pressing
a
wet
sponge
upon
her
face
then
they
raced
to
the
lagoon
and
in
a
few
minutes
were
splashing
and
ducking
in
the
water
they
spent
more
time
there
than
jim
had
intended
their
return
being
delayed
by
a
spirited
boat
race
between
harry
slippers
conducted
by
wally
and
jim
by
the
time
harry
had
rescued
his
sopping
footgear
the
offenders
were
beyond
pursuit
in
the
middle
of
the
lagoon
so
he
contented
himself
with
annexing
jim
slippers
in
which
he
proudly
returned
to
the
house
jim
arriving
just
too
late
to
save
his
own
promptly
collared
those
of
wally
leaving
the
youth
no
alternative
but
to
paddle
home
in
the
slippers
the
ground
being
too
rough
and
stony
to
admit
of
barefoot
travelling
norah
fresh
from
the
bath
was
prancing
about
the
verandah
in
her
kimono
as
the
boys
raced
up
to
the
house
her
hair
a
dusky
cloud
about
her
face
not
dressed
you
laziness
jim
flung
at
her
well
you
are
either
was
the
merry
retort
no
but
we
got
no
silly
hair
to
brush
pooh
that
wo
take
me
any
time
brown
up
jim
and
she
says
breakfast
will
be
ready
in
ten
good
old
brownie
jim
ejaculated
ca
beat
her
can
you
know
if
she
got
the
swag
packed
everything
packed
and
she
given
it
all
to
billy
and
it
on
old
polly
by
polly
was
the
packhorse
such
a
jolly
big
bundle
and
everything
covered
over
with
cabbage
leaves
to
keep
it
hooroo
for
casey
well
scurry
and
get
dressed
old
girl
i
bet
you
keep
us
waiting
at
the
i
sure
i
wo
was
the
indignant
answer
as
norah
ran
off
through
the
hail
think
of
how
much
longer
you
take
over
your
breakfast
ten
minutes
later
breakfast
smoked
on
the
wide
kitchen
table
brown
like
a
presiding
goddess
flourishing
a
big
spoon
by
a
that
sent
up
a
savoury
odour
i
sure
i
hope
you
all
kindly
excuse
having
it
in
here
she
said
in
pained
tones
no
use
to
think
of
those
lazy
hussies
of
girls
having
the
ready
at
this
hour
so
i
thought
as
how
you
mind
not
much
brown
jim
laughed
you
too
good
to
us
altogether
eggs
and
bacon
well
you
are
a
brick
cold
tucker
would
have
done
splendidly
for
cold
indeed
not
if
i
know
it
and
you
precious
lambs
off
for
such
a
ride
and
going
to
be
hot
weather
and
all
said
the
breathless
brown
indignantly
now
you
just
eat
a
good
breakfast
miss
norah
my
love
i
doughnuts
here
nearly
done
nice
and
puffy
and
brown
just
as
you
like
them
so
hurry
up
and
do
let
your
bacon
get
there
was
not
indeed
much
chance
for
the
bacon
which
disappeared
in
a
manner
truly
alarming
while
its
fate
was
speedily
shared
by
the
huge
pile
of
crisp
doughnuts
which
brown
presently
placed
upon
the
table
with
a
flourish
we
do
get
things
like
this
at
school
wally
said
regretfully
pausing
for
an
instant
before
his
seventh
all
the
more
reason
you
should
eat
plenty
now
said
their
constructor
holding
the
doughnuts
temptingly
beneath
his
nose
come
now
dearie
do
eat
something
and
wally
bashfully
recommenced
his
efforts
how
billy
getting
on
jim
inquired
billy
in
the
back
kitchen
master
jim
my
love
and
you
no
call
to
worry
your
head
about
him
he
had
three
plates
of
bacon
and
five
eggs
and
most
like
by
this
time
he
finished
all
his
doughnuts
and
drunk
his
dry
that
black
image
will
eat
anythink
concluded
brown
solemnly
well
i
ca
eat
anything
more
anyhow
jim
declared
how
we
all
going
to
ride
fifteen
miles
beats
me
if
we
sleep
all
day
instead
of
catching
fish
for
you
you
only
got
yourself
to
blame
whereat
brown
emitted
fat
and
satisfied
chuckles
and
the
meeting
broke
up
noisily
and
rushed
off
to
find
its
hats
six
ponies
in
a
line
against
the
stable
yard
fence
bobs
with
an
eye
looking
round
hopefully
for
norah
and
sugar
mick
most
of
chestnuts
and
jim
especial
delight
topsy
and
barcoo
good
useful
station
ponies
with
plenty
of
fun
yet
warranted
not
to
break
the
necks
of
bung
eye
a
lean
piebald
that
no
one
but
black
billy
ever
thought
of
riding
next
to
him
old
polly
packed
securely
with
the
day
provisions
two
stuck
out
from
her
bundles
and
a
big
bunch
of
hobbles
jingled
as
she
moved
there
was
nothing
in
the
saddles
to
distinguish
norah
mount
for
she
too
rode
astride
linton
had
a
rooted
dislike
to
side
saddles
and
was
wont
to
say
he
preferred
horses
with
sound
withers
and
a
daughter
whose
right
hip
was
not
higher
than
her
left
so
norah
rode
on
a
dainty
little
hunting
saddle
like
jim
her
habit
being
a
neat
divided
skirt
which
had
the
double
advantage
of
looking
nice
on
horseback
and
having
no
bothersome
tail
to
hold
up
when
off
the
boys
were
dressed
without
regard
to
appearances
loose
old
coats
and
trousers
soft
shirts
and
leggings
towels
peeping
out
of
polly
packs
indicated
that
jim
had
not
forgotten
the
possibilities
of
bathing
which
the
creek
afforded
a
tin
teapot
jangled
cheerfully
against
a
black
billy
all
right
you
chaps
jim
ran
his
eye
over
the
ponies
and
their
gear
better
have
a
look
at
your
girths
come
norah
was
already
in
the
saddle
exulting
over
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
jim
prophecy
that
she
would
be
late
she
was
the
first
to
be
mounted
bobs
was
prancing
happily
infected
with
the
gaiety
of
the
moment
the
sweet
morning
air
and
sunshine
and
the
spirit
of
mirth
that
was
everywhere
mick
joined
him
in
capering
as
jim
swung
himself
into
the
saddle
billy
leading
polly
and
betraying
an
evident
distaste
for
a
task
which
so
hampered
the
freedom
of
his
movements
moved
off
down
the
track
just
as
wally
and
harry
mounted
a
tall
figure
in
pyjamas
appeared
at
the
gate
of
the
back
yard
there
dad
norah
cried
gleefully
cantering
up
to
him
the
boys
followed
had
to
get
up
to
see
the
last
of
you
linton
said
not
much
chance
of
sleeping
anyhow
with
you
rowdy
people
did
we
wake
you
dad
very
sorry
are
you
linton
laughed
at
the
merry
face
well
take
care
of
yourselves
remember
norah
in
your
charge
jim
and
all
the
others
in
yours
norah
keep
an
eye
to
your
ponies
and
do
let
them
stray
too
far
even
if
they
are
hobbled
and
mind
you
bring
me
home
any
amount
of
fish
harry
and
we
will
sir
chorused
the
boys
norah
leant
from
her
saddle
and
slipped
an
arm
round
her
father
neck
dad
my
little
girl
be
careful
do
linton
kissed
her
fondly
well
you
all
in
a
hurry
and
so
am
i
to
get
back
to
bed
all
of
you
have
a
good
the
echoes
brought
back
the
merry
shout
as
the
six
ponies
disappeared
round
the
bend
in
the
track
down
the
track
to
the
first
gate
billy
holding
it
open
showed
his
white
teeth
in
a
broad
grin
as
the
merry
band
swept
through
then
over
the
long
grass
of
the
broad
paddock
swift
hoofs
shaking
off
the
dewdrops
that
yet
hung
sparkling
in
the
sunshine
billy
plodded
far
behind
with
the
packhorse
envy
in
his
heart
and
discontent
with
the
fate
that
kept
him
so
far
in
the
rear
compelled
to
progress
at
the
tamest
of
jogs
the
second
paddock
traversed
they
passed
through
the
sliprails
into
a
bush
paddock
known
as
the
wide
plain
it
was
heavily
timbered
towards
one
end
where
the
river
formed
its
boundary
but
towards
the
end
at
which
they
entered
was
almost
cleared
only
a
few
logs
lying
here
and
there
and
occasionally
a
tall
dead
tree
what
a
place
for
a
gallop
said
harry
his
quiet
face
was
flushed
and
his
eyes
sparkling
look
at
old
harry
jeered
wally
he
quite
excited
does
your
mother
know
you
out
hal
i
punch
you
young
wally
retorted
harry
just
you
be
civil
but
is
it
a
splendid
place
why
there
a
clear
run
for
a
mile
i
should
more
than
that
jim
answered
we
often
raced
oh
norah
eyes
fairly
danced
let
have
a
race
now
noble
idea
exclaimed
wally
well
it
have
to
be
a
handicap
to
make
it
fair
jim
said
if
we
start
level
norah
pony
can
beat
any
of
the
others
and
i
think
mick
can
beat
the
other
two
at
any
rate
we
give
you
fellows
a
start
and
norah
must
give
me
i
do
care
norah
said
gleefully
digging
her
heel
into
bobs
with
the
result
that
that
animal
suddenly
executed
a
bound
in
steady
you
duffer
i
did
mean
any
offence
bobsie
dear
she
patted
his
neck
i
should
think
you
would
care
jim
said
best
pony
and
lightest
weight
you
ought
to
be
able
to
leave
any
of
us
miles
behind
so
give
you
a
beautiful
handicap
young
woman
where
the
winning
post
harry
asked
see
that
big
black
tree
the
one
just
near
the
boundary
fence
i
mean
it
a
few
chains
from
the
fence
really
we
finish
there
jim
replied
come
on
then
said
norah
impatiently
get
on
ahead
harry
and
wally
you
have
to
sing
out
jim
and
sing
it
out
loud
we
be
ever
so
far
right
oh
jim
said
harry
clear
on
a
good
way
you
the
heaviest
pull
up
when
i
tell
you
you
too
he
watched
the
two
boys
ride
on
slowly
and
sang
out
to
them
to
stop
when
he
considered
they
had
received
a
fair
start
then
he
rode
on
himself
until
he
was
midway
between
wally
and
norah
harry
some
distance
ahead
of
the
former
the
ponies
had
an
inkling
of
what
was
in
the
wind
and
were
dancing
with
impatience
now
then
norah
jim
flung
a
laughing
look
over
his
shoulder
no
cribbing
there
i
not
came
an
indignant
voice
all
right
do
ready
every
one
then
go
as
the
word
go
left
jim
lips
the
four
ponies
sprang
forward
sharply
and
a
moment
later
were
in
full
gallop
over
the
soft
springy
turf
it
was
an
ideal
place
for
a
race
clear
ground
covered
with
short
soft
grass
well
eaten
off
by
the
sheep
no
trees
to
bar
the
way
and
over
all
a
sky
of
the
brightest
blue
flecked
by
tiny
fleecy
cloudlets
they
tore
over
the
paddock
shouting
at
the
ponies
laughing
hurling
defiance
at
each
other
at
first
harry
kept
his
lead
but
weight
will
tell
and
presently
wally
was
almost
level
with
him
with
jim
not
far
behind
bobs
had
not
gone
too
well
at
first
he
was
too
excited
to
get
thoroughly
into
his
stride
and
had
spent
his
time
in
dancing
when
he
should
have
been
making
up
his
handicap
when
however
he
did
condescend
to
gallop
the
distance
that
separated
him
from
the
other
ponies
was
rapidly
overhauled
norah
leaning
forward
in
her
stirrups
her
face
alight
with
eagerness
urged
him
on
with
voice
and
hand
she
rarely
if
ever
touched
him
with
a
whip
at
any
time
quickly
she
gained
on
the
others
now
harry
was
caught
and
passed
even
as
jim
caught
wally
and
deprived
him
of
the
lead
he
had
gaily
held
for
some
time
wally
shouted
laughing
abuse
at
him
flogging
his
pony
on
the
while
now
norah
was
neck
and
neck
with
wally
and
slowly
she
drew
past
him
and
set
sail
after
jim
that
she
could
beat
him
she
knew
very
well
but
the
question
was
was
there
time
to
catch
him
the
big
tree
which
formed
the
winning
post
was
very
near
now
scoot
bobsie
dear
whispered
norah
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
she
was
saying
anything
unmaidenly
at
any
rate
bobs
understood
for
he
went
forward
with
a
bound
they
were
nearly
level
with
jim
now
wally
desperately
flogging
close
in
the
rear
at
that
moment
jim
pony
put
his
foot
into
a
hole
and
went
down
like
a
shot
rabbit
bowling
over
and
over
jim
flung
like
a
stone
out
of
a
catapult
landed
some
distance
ahead
of
the
pony
he
too
rolled
for
a
moment
and
then
lay
still
it
seemed
to
norah
that
she
pulled
bobs
up
almost
in
his
stride
certainly
she
was
off
before
he
had
fairly
slackened
to
a
walk
throwing
herself
wildly
from
the
saddle
she
tore
up
to
jim
jim
who
lay
horribly
still
jim
dear
jim
she
cried
she
took
his
head
on
her
knee
jim
oh
jim
do
speak
to
me
there
was
no
sound
the
boy
lay
motionless
his
tanned
face
strangely
white
harry
coming
up
jumped
off
and
ran
to
his
side
is
he
hurt
much
i
do
know
no
do
you
say
he
hurt
much
he
could
be
in
such
a
second
jim
dear
speak
old
chap
a
big
sob
rose
in
her
throat
and
choked
her
at
the
heavy
silence
harry
took
jim
wrist
in
his
hand
and
felt
with
fumbling
fingers
for
the
pulse
wally
having
pulled
his
pony
up
with
difficulty
came
tearing
back
to
the
little
group
is
he
killed
he
whispered
awestruck
a
little
shiver
ran
through
jim
body
slowly
he
opened
his
eyes
and
stretched
himself
what
up
he
said
weakly
oh
i
know
mick
he
all
right
darling
norah
said
with
a
quivering
voice
are
you
hurt
much
bit
of
a
bump
on
my
head
jim
said
struggling
to
a
sitting
position
he
rubbed
his
forehead
what
up
norah
for
the
brown
head
had
gone
down
on
his
knee
and
the
shoulders
were
shaking
jim
patted
her
head
very
gently
you
dear
old
duffer
he
said
tenderly
chapter
anglers
bend
jim
bump
on
the
head
luckily
proved
not
very
serious
a
handkerchief
soaked
in
the
creek
by
wally
who
rode
there
and
back
at
a
wild
gallop
proved
an
effective
bandage
applied
energetically
by
harry
who
had
studied
in
an
ambulance
class
ten
minutes
of
this
treatment
however
proved
as
much
as
jim
patience
would
stand
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
firmly
removed
the
handkerchief
and
professed
himself
cured
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
about
anyhow
he
declared
in
answer
to
sympathetic
inquiries
head
a
bit
but
nothing
to
grumble
at
it
be
all
right
if
we
ride
along
steadily
for
a
while
i
do
think
i
do
any
more
racing
just
now
though
thank
you
who
won
that
race
queried
harry
laughing
the
spirits
of
the
little
party
from
being
suddenly
at
zero
had
gone
up
with
a
bound
blessed
if
i
know
said
jim
i
only
know
i
was
leading
until
mick
ended
matters
for
i
led
after
that
anyhow
said
wally
could
pull
my
beauty
up
he
was
so
excited
by
mick
i
have
won
in
the
long
run
norah
said
there
were
still
traces
of
tears
in
her
eyes
but
her
face
was
merry
enough
she
was
riding
very
close
to
jim
yes
i
think
you
would
jim
answered
you
and
bobs
were
coming
up
like
a
hurricane
last
time
i
looked
round
never
mind
we
call
it
anybody
race
and
have
it
over
again
they
rode
along
for
a
few
miles
keeping
close
to
the
river
which
wound
in
and
out
fringed
with
a
thick
belt
of
scrub
amongst
which
rose
tall
trees
flights
of
cockatoos
screamed
over
their
heads
and
magpies
gurgled
in
the
thick
shades
by
the
water
occasionally
came
the
clear
whistle
of
a
lyre
bird
or
the
peal
of
a
laughing
jackass
jim
knew
all
the
as
well
as
the
signs
of
bush
game
and
pointed
them
out
as
they
rode
once
a
big
wallaby
showed
for
an
instant
and
there
was
a
general
outcry
and
a
plunge
in
pursuit
but
the
wallaby
was
too
quick
for
them
and
found
a
safe
in
the
thickest
of
the
scrub
where
the
ponies
could
not
follow
we
cross
the
creek
up
here
jim
said
and
make
country
a
bit
it
saves
several
how
do
you
cross
bridge
queried
wally
bridge
do
grow
such
things
in
this
part
of
the
world
laughed
jim
no
there
a
place
where
it
easy
enough
to
ford
a
little
way
up
there
are
plenty
of
places
fordable
if
you
only
know
them
on
this
creek
but
a
number
of
them
are
dangerous
because
of
deep
holes
and
boggy
places
father
lost
a
good
horse
in
one
of
those
bogs
and
to
look
at
the
place
you
only
have
thought
it
a
nice
level
bit
of
grassy
my
word
wally
whistled
what
a
bit
of
hard
luck
yes
it
was
rather
jim
said
it
made
us
careful
about
crossing
i
can
tell
you
even
the
men
look
out
since
harry
wilson
got
bogged
another
time
trying
to
get
over
after
a
bullock
of
course
he
wait
to
go
round
and
he
had
an
awful
job
to
get
his
horse
out
of
the
mud
it
something
like
a
quicksand
after
that
father
had
two
or
three
good
crossings
made
very
plain
and
clear
and
whenever
a
new
man
is
put
on
they
explained
to
him
see
there
one
they
came
suddenly
on
a
gap
in
the
scrub
leading
directly
to
the
creek
which
was
indeed
more
of
a
river
than
a
creek
and
in
winter
ran
in
a
broad
rapid
stream
even
in
summer
it
ran
always
though
the
full
current
dwindled
to
a
trickling
sluggish
streamlet
with
here
and
there
a
deep
quiet
pool
where
the
fish
lay
hidden
through
the
long
hot
days
all
the
brushwood
and
trees
had
been
cleared
away
leaving
a
broad
pathway
to
the
creek
at
the
edge
of
the
gap
a
big
board
nailed
to
a
tall
tree
bore
the
word
ford
in
large
letters
farther
on
between
the
trees
a
glimpse
of
shining
water
caught
the
eye
that
the
way
father
had
all
the
fords
marked
norah
said
he
says
it
no
good
running
risks
for
the
sake
of
a
little
dad
always
preaching
that
jim
observed
he
says
people
are
too
fond
of
putting
up
with
makeshifts
that
cost
ever
so
much
more
time
and
trouble
than
it
does
to
do
a
thing
thoroughly
at
the
start
so
he
always
makes
us
do
a
thing
just
as
well
as
we
know
how
and
there
no
end
of
rows
if
he
finds
any
one
doing
a
job
well
and
finish
better
he
says
my
word
it
gives
you
a
lesson
to
see
how
he
fixes
a
thing
dear
old
dad
said
norah
softly
half
to
herself
i
think
your
father
just
splendid
harry
said
enthusiastically
he
does
give
you
a
good
time
yes
i
know
he
does
jim
said
i
reckon
he
the
best
man
that
ever
lived
all
the
same
he
does
mean
to
give
me
a
good
time
always
when
i
leave
school
i
got
to
work
and
make
my
own
living
with
just
a
start
from
him
he
says
he
not
going
to
bring
any
boy
up
to
be
a
jim
eyes
grew
soft
i
mean
to
show
him
i
can
work
too
he
said
they
were
at
the
water
edge
and
the
ponies
gratefully
put
their
heads
down
for
a
drink
of
the
cool
stream
that
clattered
and
danced
over
its
stony
bed
after
they
had
finished
jim
led
the
way
through
the
water
which
was
only
deep
enough
to
wash
the
ponies
knees
when
they
had
climbed
the
opposite
bank
a
wide
grassy
plain
stretched
before
them
we
cut
across
here
norah
explained
and
pick
up
the
creek
over
there
that
saves
a
good
does
billy
know
this
cut
harry
queried
what
does
billy
know
norah
laughed
come
they
cantered
slowly
over
the
grass
remembering
that
jim
was
scarcely
fit
yet
for
violent
exercise
though
he
stoutly
averred
that
his
accident
had
left
no
traces
whatever
the
sun
was
getting
high
and
it
was
hot
away
from
the
cool
shade
near
the
creek
twice
a
hare
bounded
off
in
the
grass
and
once
harry
jumped
off
hurriedly
and
killed
a
big
brown
snake
that
was
lazily
sunning
itself
upon
a
broad
log
i
do
hate
those
beasts
he
said
remounting
norah
had
held
his
pony
for
him
so
do
i
she
nodded
only
one
gets
used
to
them
father
found
one
on
his
pillow
the
other
by
george
harry
said
did
he
kill
it
yes
rather
they
are
pretty
thick
here
especially
a
bit
earlier
than
this
one
got
into
the
kitchen
through
the
window
by
the
big
vine
that
grows
outside
and
when
brown
pulled
down
the
blind
it
came
too
it
was
on
the
roller
that
was
last
christmas
and
brown
says
she
shaking
still
snakes
are
rummy
things
harry
observed
ever
hear
that
you
can
charm
them
with
music
i
heard
it
norah
said
quaintly
her
tone
implied
that
it
was
a
piece
of
evidence
she
did
not
accept
on
hearsay
well
i
believe
it
true
last
summer
a
whole
lot
of
us
were
out
on
the
verandah
and
there
was
plenty
of
laughing
and
talking
going
on
a
snake
would
crawl
into
a
rowdy
group
like
that
for
the
fun
of
it
now
would
he
it
was
christmas
day
and
my
little
brother
phil
six
had
found
a
piccolo
in
his
stocking
and
he
was
sitting
on
the
end
of
the
verandah
playing
away
at
this
thing
we
thought
it
was
a
bit
of
a
row
but
phil
was
quite
happy
presently
my
sister
vera
looked
at
him
and
screamed
out
there
a
snake
so
there
was
and
it
was
just
beside
phil
it
had
crawled
up
between
the
verandah
boards
and
was
lying
quietly
near
the
little
chap
looking
at
him
stealthily
he
was
blowing
away
quite
unconcerned
we
know
what
to
do
for
a
moment
for
the
beastly
thing
was
so
near
phil
that
we
did
like
to
hit
it
for
fear
we
missed
and
it
bit
him
however
phil
solved
the
difficulty
by
getting
up
and
walking
off
still
playing
the
piccolo
the
snake
never
stirred
when
he
did
and
you
may
be
sure
it
did
get
much
chance
to
stir
after
three
sticks
came
down
on
it
at
the
same
i
say
norah
breathed
quickly
what
an
escape
for
poor
phil
was
it
he
did
seem
to
care
a
bit
when
we
showed
him
the
snake
and
told
him
it
had
been
so
near
him
he
had
known
a
thing
about
it
be
bovvered
wiv
snakes
was
all
he
when
i
was
a
little
kiddie
norah
said
they
found
me
playing
with
a
snake
one
playing
with
it
harry
echoed
yes
i
was
only
about
two
and
i
do
remember
anything
about
it
dad
came
on
to
the
back
verandah
and
saw
me
sitting
by
a
patch
of
dust
stroking
something
he
could
make
out
what
it
was
at
first
and
then
he
came
a
bit
nearer
and
saw
that
it
was
a
big
snake
it
was
lying
in
the
dust
sunning
itself
and
i
was
stroking
it
most
by
george
said
harry
funny
what
things
kiddies
will
do
said
norah
with
all
the
superiority
of
twelve
long
years
it
frightened
dad
tremendously
he
did
know
what
to
do
he
did
dare
come
near
or
call
out
i
the
snake
saw
him
it
began
to
move
it
crawled
right
over
my
bare
and
never
bit
you
no
i
kept
on
stroking
its
back
as
it
went
over
my
knees
without
the
least
idea
that
it
was
anything
dangerous
dad
said
it
seemed
years
and
years
before
it
went
right
over
and
crawled
away
from
me
into
the
grass
he
had
me
out
of
the
way
in
about
half
a
second
and
got
a
stick
and
i
cried
like
anything
when
he
killed
it
and
said
he
was
naughty
if
you
chaps
have
finished
swopping
snake
yarns
said
jim
turning
in
his
saddle
there
anglers
they
had
been
riding
steadily
across
the
plain
until
they
had
again
come
near
the
which
marked
the
course
of
the
creek
following
the
direction
pointed
by
jim
finger
they
saw
a
deep
curve
in
the
green
where
the
creek
suddenly
left
the
fairly
straight
course
it
had
been
pursuing
and
made
two
great
bends
something
like
a
capital
u
the
points
of
which
lay
in
their
direction
they
rode
down
between
them
until
they
were
almost
at
the
water
edge
here
the
creek
was
very
deep
and
in
sweeping
round
had
cut
out
a
wide
bed
nearly
three
times
its
usual
breadth
tall
trees
grew
almost
to
the
verge
of
the
banks
on
both
sides
so
that
the
water
was
almost
always
in
shadow
while
so
high
were
the
banks
that
few
breezes
were
able
to
ripple
its
surface
it
lay
placid
all
the
year
scarcely
troubled
even
in
winter
when
the
other
parts
of
the
creek
rushed
and
tumbled
in
flood
there
was
room
in
the
high
banks
of
anglers
bend
for
all
the
extra
water
and
its
presence
was
only
marked
by
the
strength
of
the
current
that
ran
in
the
very
centre
of
the
stream
just
now
the
water
was
not
high
and
seemed
very
far
below
the
children
who
sat
looking
at
it
from
their
ponies
on
the
bank
as
they
watched
in
silence
a
fish
leaped
in
the
middle
of
the
bend
the
sudden
movement
seemed
amazing
in
the
stillness
it
flashed
for
an
instant
in
a
patch
of
sunlight
and
then
fell
back
sending
circling
ripples
spreading
to
each
bank
good
omen
i
hope
harry
said
though
they
often
do
bite
when
they
jump
you
it
not
often
they
do
bite
here
jim
said
well
it
looks
a
good
enough
place
for
anything
if
we
ca
catch
fish
here
we
wo
be
up
to
much
as
anglers
harry
said
you
been
here
before
have
you
norah
wally
asked
oh
yes
ever
so
many
father
and
norah
have
great
fishing
excursions
on
their
own
said
jim
they
take
a
tent
and
camp
out
for
two
or
three
days
with
billy
as
general
flunkey
i
do
know
how
many
whales
they
have
caught
at
this
place
they
know
the
bend
as
well
as
any
well
i
guess
we
better
take
off
the
saddles
and
get
to
work
said
norah
slipping
off
bobs
and
patting
his
neck
before
undoing
the
girth
the
boys
followed
her
example
and
soon
the
saddles
were
safely
stowed
in
the
shade
then
jim
turned
with
a
laugh
well
we
are
duffers
he
said
ca
do
a
thing
till
billy
turns
up
he
got
all
the
hooks
and
lines
all
the
bait
all
the
hobbles
all
the
everything
whistled
the
boys
well
it
does
matter
norah
said
cheerfully
there
lots
to
do
we
can
hang
up
the
ponies
while
we
hunt
for
rods
you
boys
have
got
your
strong
knives
have
you
they
had
and
immediately
scattered
to
work
the
ponies
having
been
tied
securely
under
a
grove
of
saplings
the
search
for
rods
began
and
soon
four
long
straight
sticks
were
obtained
with
the
necessary
amount
of
then
they
hunted
for
a
suitable
where
lunch
might
be
eaten
without
too
much
disturbance
from
flies
and
mosquitoes
and
gathered
a
good
supply
of
dry
sticks
for
a
fire
billy
ought
to
bless
us
anyhow
jim
grinned
yes
ought
he
come
along
and
see
if
he
they
ran
out
upon
the
plain
and
cheerful
exclamations
immediately
proclaimed
the
fact
that
billy
and
the
old
packhorse
had
at
length
made
their
appearance
in
what
wally
called
the
billy
soon
clattered
up
to
the
little
party
the
hobbles
and
quart
pot
jingling
cheerfully
on
old
polly
back
he
grinned
amiably
at
the
four
merry
faces
awaiting
him
in
the
shade
of
a
wattle
tree
this
feller
pretty
slow
he
said
indicating
polly
with
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
you
all
waitin
for
tackle
rather
said
jim
never
mind
we
got
everything
ready
look
sharp
and
shy
down
the
hooks
billy
they
in
that
tin
and
the
lines
are
tied
on
to
it
in
a
parcel
that
right
as
the
black
boy
tossed
the
tackle
down
and
he
caught
it
deftly
now
you
chaps
get
to
work
and
get
your
lines
right
oh
said
the
chorus
as
it
fell
to
work
billy
made
a
swift
incursion
into
the
interior
of
the
pack
and
fished
up
a
tin
of
worms
and
some
raw
meat
wally
being
the
only
one
to
patronize
the
latter
the
other
three
baited
their
hooks
with
worms
and
all
being
in
readiness
made
their
way
down
the
steep
bank
at
a
place
where
a
little
cleft
gave
easier
access
to
a
tiny
shelving
beach
below
here
a
great
had
long
ago
been
left
by
an
unusually
high
flood
and
formed
a
splendid
place
to
fish
from
as
it
jutted
out
for
some
distance
over
the
stream
norah
scrambled
out
like
a
cat
to
its
farthest
extremity
and
harry
followed
her
for
part
of
the
way
wally
and
jim
settled
themselves
at
intervals
along
the
trunk
sinkers
floats
and
baits
were
examined
and
the
business
of
the
day
began
everybody
knows
how
it
feels
to
fish
you
throw
in
your
hook
with
such
blissful
certainty
that
no
fish
can
possibly
resist
the
temptation
you
are
dangling
before
its
eyes
there
is
suppressed
excitement
all
over
you
you
are
all
on
the
alert
feeling
for
imaginary
nibbles
for
bites
that
are
not
there
sometimes
of
course
the
dreams
come
true
and
the
bites
are
realities
but
these
occasions
are
sadly
outnumbered
by
the
times
when
you
keep
on
feeling
and
bobbing
your
line
vainly
while
excitement
lulls
to
expectation
and
expectation
merges
into
hope
and
hope
becomes
wishing
and
wishing
often
dies
down
to
disappointment
such
was
the
gradual
fate
of
the
fishing
party
at
anglers
bend
at
first
the
four
floats
were
watched
with
an
intensity
of
regard
that
should
surely
have
had
some
effect
in
luring
fishes
to
the
surface
but
as
the
minutes
dragged
by
and
not
a
fish
seemed
inclined
even
to
nibble
the
solemn
silence
which
had
brooded
on
the
quartet
was
broken
by
sundry
fidgetings
and
wrigglings
and
suppressed
remarks
on
the
variableness
of
fish
and
the
slowness
of
fishing
men
enjoy
the
sport
because
they
can
light
their
pipes
and
smoke
in
expectant
ease
but
the
consolation
of
tobacco
was
debarred
from
boys
who
were
as
jim
put
it
too
young
to
smoke
and
too
old
to
make
idiots
of
themselves
by
trying
it
and
so
they
found
it
undeniably
dull
billy
came
down
to
join
the
party
presently
after
he
had
seen
to
his
horses
and
unpacked
old
polly
load
his
appearance
gave
jim
a
brilliant
idea
and
he
promptly
despatched
the
black
boy
for
cake
which
proved
a
welcome
stimulant
to
flagging
enthusiasm
do
know
if
fish
care
about
cake
crumbs
said
harry
finishing
a
huge
slice
with
some
regret
did
get
a
chance
of
sampling
any
of
mine
wally
laughed
i
wanted
it
all
myself
hallo
what
is
it
a
bite
rather
such
a
whopper
i
got
it
too
wally
gasped
tugging
at
his
line
you
got
it
right
enough
jim
said
why
your
rod
bending
right
over
want
a
hand
no
thanks
manage
it
myself
said
the
fisherman
tugging
manfully
here
she
comes
the
line
came
in
faster
now
and
the
strain
on
the
rod
was
plain
excitement
ran
high
it
a
great
big
perch
i
do
believe
norah
exclaimed
just
fancy
if
it
beats
dad
big
boomer
the
biggest
ever
caught
it
beat
some
records
wally
gasped
hauling
in
frantically
here
she
comes
she
came
with
a
final
jerk
jim
broke
into
a
suppressed
shout
of
laughter
for
wally
catch
was
nothing
less
than
an
ancient
boot
chapter
vi
a
bush
fire
wally
disentangled
his
hook
gravely
while
the
others
would
have
laughed
more
heartily
but
for
fear
of
frightening
the
fish
well
i
blessed
said
the
captor
at
length
surveying
the
prize
with
his
nose
in
the
air
a
blooming
old
boot
been
there
since
the
year
one
i
should
think
by
the
look
of
i
thought
you
had
a
whale
at
the
very
least
grinned
harry
well
i
broken
my
duck
anyhow
and
that
more
than
any
of
you
others
can
say
wally
laughed
time
enough
for
you
to
grin
when
caught
something
yourselves
even
if
it
only
an
old
boot
it
a
real
old
stager
and
no
mistake
i
wonder
how
it
came
in
some
poor
old
beggar
of
a
swaggie
i
expect
jim
said
he
chuck
it
away
until
it
was
pretty
well
done
did
he
look
at
the
holes
in
the
uppers
and
there
no
sole
left
to
speak
do
you
see
many
tramps
here
harry
asked
not
many
we
too
far
from
a
road
jim
replied
of
course
there
are
a
certain
number
who
know
of
the
station
and
are
sure
of
getting
tucker
there
and
a
job
if
they
want
one
not
that
many
of
them
do
the
lazy
beggars
most
of
them
would
be
injured
if
you
asked
them
to
chop
a
bit
of
wood
in
return
for
a
meal
and
some
of
them
threaten
to
set
the
place
on
fire
if
they
do
get
all
they
my
word
said
wally
did
they
ever
do
it
once
two
years
ago
jim
answered
a
fellow
came
one
hot
evening
in
january
we
had
a
long
spell
of
heat
and
all
our
meat
had
gone
bad
that
day
there
was
hardly
a
bit
in
the
place
and
of
course
they
could
kill
a
beast
till
evening
about
the
middle
of
the
day
this
chap
turned
up
and
asked
for
tucker
mrs
brown
gave
him
bread
and
flour
and
tea
and
some
cake
a
real
good
haul
for
any
swaggie
it
was
too
good
for
this
fellow
for
he
immediately
turned
up
his
proud
nose
and
said
he
wanted
meat
brown
explained
that
she
had
any
to
give
him
but
he
evidently
believe
her
said
it
was
our
darned
meanness
and
seeing
no
men
about
got
pretty
insulting
at
last
he
tried
to
force
his
way
past
brown
into
the
did
he
get
in
asked
wally
nearly
not
quite
though
dad
and
norah
and
i
had
been
out
riding
and
we
came
home
past
the
back
yard
in
the
nick
of
time
we
could
hear
what
the
fellow
was
saying
to
brown
but
his
attitude
was
enough
to
make
us
pull
up
and
as
we
did
so
we
saw
him
try
to
shove
her
aside
she
was
plucky
enough
and
banged
the
door
in
his
face
but
he
got
his
foot
in
the
crack
so
that
it
could
shut
and
began
to
push
it
open
dad
slipped
off
his
horse
gently
he
made
a
sign
to
us
to
keep
quiet
and
went
across
the
yard
and
we
saw
him
shake
the
lash
of
his
stockwhip
loose
you
can
just
fancy
how
norah
and
i
were
dancing
with
joy
dad
was
just
near
the
verandah
when
we
saw
the
door
give
poor
old
brownie
was
getting
the
worst
of
it
we
heard
the
fellow
call
out
something
a
threat
and
dad
arm
went
up
and
the
stockwhip
came
down
like
a
flash
across
the
man
shoulder
he
gave
one
yell
you
never
heard
such
an
amazed
and
terrified
roar
in
your
life
and
jim
chuckled
with
joy
at
the
recollection
he
turned
on
dad
and
jumped
at
him
but
he
got
another
one
with
the
whip
that
made
him
pause
and
then
dad
caught
him
and
shook
him
like
a
rat
swaggie
was
limp
enough
when
it
was
over
a
very
good
mind
to
give
you
in
charge
dad
said
he
was
simply
furious
it
made
a
fellow
feel
pretty
bad
to
see
poor
old
white
face
in
the
doorway
and
to
think
what
a
fright
she
had
had
the
swaggie
turned
a
very
ugly
look
on
dad
give
me
in
charge
and
i
precious
quick
have
you
up
for
assault
he
said
dad
laughed
for
that
you
can
do
exactly
as
you
choose
he
said
be
quite
ready
to
answer
for
thrashing
a
cur
like
you
however
you
not
worth
carting
seventeen
miles
to
cunjee
so
you
can
go
the
quicker
the
and
he
cleared
i
suppose
wally
asked
he
just
did
went
like
a
redshank
but
when
he
got
outside
the
gate
and
a
bit
away
he
stopped
and
turned
round
and
let
fly
at
dad
such
a
volley
of
threats
and
abuse
you
never
heard
it
finished
up
with
something
about
the
grass
we
did
quite
understand
what
but
we
remembered
it
later
and
then
it
was
clearer
to
us
however
he
did
stop
to
explain
as
dad
turned
the
dogs
loose
they
lost
no
time
and
neither
did
the
swaggie
he
left
the
place
at
about
the
rate
of
a
mile
a
minute
jim
paused
thought
i
had
a
bite
he
said
pulling
up
his
line
bother
it
the
bait
gone
chuck
me
a
worm
young
he
impaled
the
worm
and
flung
his
line
out
again
where
was
i
oh
yes
norah
and
i
were
a
bit
scared
about
the
swaggie
and
wondered
what
he
try
to
do
but
dad
only
laughed
at
us
it
never
entered
his
head
that
the
brute
would
really
try
to
have
his
revenge
of
course
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
to
have
had
him
watched
off
the
place
but
dad
did
even
think
of
it
he
knows
better
now
i
waked
up
early
next
morning
hearing
someone
yelling
outside
it
was
only
just
light
i
slipped
out
of
my
window
and
ran
into
the
yard
and
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
smoke
it
was
coming
from
the
west
a
great
cloud
of
it
with
plenty
of
wind
to
help
it
along
it
was
one
of
those
hot
autumn
mornings
you
know
the
kind
make
you
feel
who
was
yelling
asked
harry
one
of
morrison
men
he
owns
the
land
adjoining
ours
this
fellow
was
for
all
he
was
worth
better
rouse
your
men
out
quick
lively
he
sang
out
a
big
grass
fire
between
us
and
you
all
our
chaps
are
at
it
but
i
do
fancy
they
can
keep
it
back
in
this
wind
i
just
turned
and
ran
the
big
bell
we
use
for
summoning
the
men
to
their
meals
hangs
under
the
kitchen
verandah
and
i
made
a
for
it
there
seemed
plenty
of
rocks
and
bits
of
glass
about
and
my
bare
feet
got
all
at
least
i
thought
so
but
there
was
time
to
think
much
morrison
chap
had
galloped
off
as
soon
as
he
gave
his
news
i
caught
hold
of
the
and
worked
it
all
i
knew
you
should
have
seen
them
tumble
out
in
about
half
a
minute
the
place
was
like
a
jumpers
nest
that
you
stirred
up
with
a
stick
dad
came
out
of
the
back
door
in
his
pyjamas
norah
came
scudding
along
the
verandah
putting
on
her
kimono
as
she
ran
brownie
and
the
other
servants
appeared
at
their
windows
and
the
men
came
tumbling
out
of
the
barracks
and
the
hut
like
so
many
rabbits
dad
was
annoyed
are
you
doing
you
young
donkey
he
sang
out
over
there
i
says
tugging
the
bell
dad
looked
it
did
take
him
long
to
see
what
was
up
when
he
spied
that
big
cloud
of
smoke
scott
he
shouted
get
billy
to
run
the
horses
up
where
are
you
all
burrows
field
henry
get
out
the
quick
all
of
you
get
ready
dress
yourselves
quickly
you
could
see
that
was
quite
an
afterthought
on
dad
part
then
he
turned
and
fled
inside
to
how
ripping
wally
said
wriggling
on
the
log
with
joy
ripping
do
you
call
it
said
jim
indignantly
you
try
it
for
yourself
young
wally
and
see
fire
not
much
of
a
joke
when
fighting
it
yourself
i
can
tell
you
well
dad
was
out
again
in
about
two
shakes
ready
for
the
fray
and
you
can
bet
the
rest
of
us
linger
long
billy
had
the
horses
up
almost
as
soon
and
every
one
got
his
own
things
were
a
bit
merry
in
the
stockyard
i
can
tell
you
and
heels
did
fly
after
all
norah
here
was
the
first
mounted
bobs
was
in
the
stable
you
see
and
norah
had
him
saddled
before
any
of
us
had
put
our
bridles
on
goodness
knows
how
she
dressed
i
guess
it
was
much
of
a
toilet
jim
ducked
suddenly
and
a
chip
hurled
by
norah
flew
over
his
head
and
splashed
into
the
water
get
out
you
frighten
the
fish
he
said
grinning
my
yarn
old
might
have
had
the
sense
to
keep
me
out
of
it
said
norah
impolitely
you
be
jiggered
said
jim
affectionately
anyhow
boys
you
should
have
seen
dad
face
when
norah
trotted
over
from
the
stable
he
was
just
girthing
up
old
bosun
and
i
was
wrestling
with
sirdar
who
want
his
crupper
on
dear
child
dad
said
off
that
pony
and
go
back
to
bed
you
ca
think
i
could
allow
you
to
come
out
poor
old
norah
face
fell
about
a
foot
she
begged
and
argued
but
she
might
as
well
have
spared
herself
the
trouble
at
last
dad
said
she
could
ride
out
in
the
first
two
paddocks
but
no
nearer
the
fire
she
had
to
be
content
with
that
i
think
she
was
pretty
near
mopping
her
was
said
norah
indistinctly
well
we
went
off
all
of
us
had
you
know
we
always
have
them
ready
and
field
was
driving
the
it
always
stands
ready
filled
for
use
we
just
galloped
like
mad
dad
did
wait
for
any
gates
bosun
can
jump
anything
and
he
just
went
straight
across
country
luckily
there
was
no
stock
in
the
paddocks
near
the
house
except
that
in
one
small
paddock
were
about
twenty
valuable
prize
sheep
however
the
fire
was
so
far
off
that
we
reckoned
they
were
safe
and
so
we
turned
our
attention
to
the
fire
we
left
old
norah
in
the
second
paddock
looking
as
miserable
as
a
bandicoot
dad
made
her
promise
not
to
meddle
with
the
fire
me
you
wo
try
any
putting
out
on
your
own
account
he
said
and
norah
promised
very
reluctantly
i
was
jolly
sorry
you
were
out
of
it
you
know
old
kid
said
jim
reflectively
and
norah
gave
him
a
little
smile
we
made
great
time
across
the
paddocks
jim
continued
dad
was
ever
so
far
ahead
of
course
but
our
contingent
that
had
to
go
round
by
the
gates
did
do
so
badly
billy
was
on
mick
and
he
and
i
had
a
go
for
the
lead
across
the
last
who
won
asked
harry
me
said
jim
ungrammatically
when
we
got
into
the
smoke
we
had
to
go
round
a
bit
or
we
have
gone
straight
into
the
fire
we
hung
up
the
horses
in
a
corner
that
had
been
burnt
round
and
was
safe
from
more
fire
and
off
we
went
there
were
ever
so
many
men
fighting
it
all
morrison
fellows
and
a
lot
from
other
places
as
well
the
fire
had
started
right
at
our
boundary
and
had
come
across
a
acre
paddock
like
a
shot
then
a
little
creek
checked
it
a
bit
and
let
the
fighters
have
a
show
there
were
big
trees
blazing
everywhere
and
stumps
and
logs
and
every
few
minutes
the
fire
would
get
going
again
in
some
ferns
or
long
grass
and
go
like
mischief
and
half
a
dozen
men
after
it
to
stop
it
it
had
got
across
the
creek
and
there
was
a
line
of
men
on
the
bank
keeping
it
back
some
others
were
chopping
down
the
big
blazing
dead
trees
that
were
simply
showering
sparks
all
round
the
wind
was
pretty
strong
and
took
burning
leaves
and
sticks
ever
so
far
and
started
the
fire
in
different
places
three
fellows
on
ponies
were
doing
nothing
but
watch
for
these
flying
firebrands
galloping
after
them
and
putting
them
out
as
they
jim
paused
say
you
put
your
hook
in
the
water
wally
old
chap
he
suggested
wally
looked
and
blushed
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
he
had
unconsciously
pulled
up
his
line
until
the
bait
dangled
helplessly
in
the
air
a
foot
above
the
water
the
party
on
the
log
laughed
at
the
expense
of
wally
and
jim
proceeded
father
and
four
other
men
came
across
the
creek
and
sang
out
to
us
going
back
a
bit
to
burn
a
break
they
said
along
we
all
went
back
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
creek
and
lit
the
grass
spreading
out
in
a
long
line
across
the
paddock
then
every
one
kept
his
own
little
fire
from
going
in
the
wrong
direction
and
kept
it
burning
back
towards
the
creek
of
course
preventing
any
logs
or
trees
from
getting
alight
it
was
pretty
tough
work
the
smoke
was
so
bad
but
at
last
it
was
done
and
a
big
burnt
streak
put
across
the
paddock
except
for
flying
bits
of
lighted
stuff
there
was
much
risk
of
the
fire
getting
away
from
us
when
once
we
had
got
that
break
to
help
us
you
see
a
grass
fire
is
like
a
real
bush
fire
it
a
far
more
manageable
beast
it
when
you
get
fire
in
thick
scrub
that
you
can
just
make
up
your
mind
to
stand
aside
and
let
her
rip
jim
pulled
up
his
book
and
examined
his
bait
carefully
fish
seem
off
us
he
said
that
all
the
yarn
harry
asked
no
there
more
if
you
not
sick
of
well
fire
away
wally
said
impatiently
jim
let
his
sinker
go
down
gently
until
it
settled
in
comfort
in
the
soft
mud
at
the
bottom
this
is
where
i
come
to
norah
he
said
that
young
lady
turned
a
lively
red
if
you
going
to
tell
all
that
bosh
about
me
i
off
she
said
disgustedly
you
can
call
me
when
you
where
are
you
off
to
norah
inquired
harry
somewhere
to
fish
i
tired
of
you
old
gossips
norah
elevated
a
naturally
tilted
nose
as
she
wound
up
her
tackle
and
rose
to
her
feet
she
made
her
way
along
the
log
past
the
three
boys
until
she
reached
the
land
and
scrambling
up
the
bank
vanished
in
the
scrub
presently
they
saw
her
reappear
at
a
point
a
little
lower
down
where
she
ensconced
herself
in
the
roots
of
a
tree
that
was
sticking
out
of
the
bank
and
looked
extremely
unsafe
she
flung
her
line
in
below
her
perch
hope
she
all
right
harry
said
uneasily
you
bet
norah
knows
what
she
about
jim
said
calmly
she
can
swim
like
a
fish
anyhow
well
go
on
with
your
yarn
urged
wally
well
i
told
you
how
we
stopped
the
fire
at
the
little
creek
did
i
we
thought
it
was
pretty
safe
after
we
had
burnt
such
a
good
break
and
the
men
with
axes
had
chopped
down
nearly
all
the
big
trees
that
were
alight
so
that
they
could
spread
the
fire
we
reckoned
we
could
sit
down
and
mop
our
grimy
brows
and
think
what
fine
brave
bold
heroes
we
were
which
we
did
there
was
one
big
tree
the
men
could
get
down
it
was
right
on
a
bit
of
a
hill
near
the
bank
of
the
creek
a
big
brute
of
a
tree
hollow
for
about
twelve
feet
and
i
do
know
how
high
but
i
bet
it
was
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
it
got
alight
from
top
to
bottom
and
my
word
did
it
blaze
the
men
tried
to
chop
it
down
but
it
was
too
hot
a
job
even
for
a
salamander
we
could
only
watch
it
and
it
took
a
lot
of
watching
because
it
was
showering
sparks
and
bits
of
wood
and
blazing
limbs
and
twigs
in
every
direction
lots
of
times
they
blew
into
the
dead
grass
beyond
our
break
and
it
meant
galloping
to
put
them
out
the
wind
had
been
pretty
high
all
the
time
and
it
got
up
suddenly
to
a
regular
gale
it
caught
this
old
tree
and
fairly
whisked
its
burning
limbs
off
they
flew
ever
so
far
we
thought
we
had
them
all
out
when
suddenly
dad
gave
a
yell
there
was
a
little
deep
gully
running
at
right
angles
to
the
creek
and
right
through
the
paddocks
up
to
the
house
in
winter
it
was
a
creek
but
now
it
was
dry
as
a
bone
and
rank
with
dead
grass
at
the
bottom
as
we
looked
we
saw
smoke
rise
from
this
gully
far
away
in
the
home
paddock
shropshires
said
dad
and
he
made
a
run
for
bosun
how
we
did
tear
i
never
thought
old
dad
could
run
so
hard
it
seemed
miles
to
the
corner
where
the
horses
were
and
ages
before
we
got
on
them
and
were
racing
for
the
home
paddock
and
all
the
time
the
smoke
was
creeping
along
that
beastly
gully
and
we
knew
well
enough
that
tear
as
we
might
we
could
be
in
time
you
see
the
valuable
sheep
were
in
a
paddock
where
this
gully
ended
it
was
very
near
the
house
and
no
one
might
see
the
fire
before
every
sheep
was
roasted
we
had
only
just
got
them
dad
had
imported
some
from
england
and
some
from
tasmania
and
i
do
know
how
much
they
had
were
you
afraid
for
the
house
as
well
asked
harry
no
there
was
a
big
ploughed
paddock
near
the
house
it
would
have
taken
a
tremendous
fire
to
get
over
that
and
the
orchard
and
garden
we
only
worried
about
the
shropshires
i
got
the
lead
away
but
dad
caught
me
up
pretty
soon
between
us
and
the
sheep
paddock
there
were
only
wire
fences
which
he
would
take
bosun
over
so
he
could
race
away
from
the
rest
of
us
this
time
we
might
as
well
take
it
easy
he
said
all
the
good
we
can
do
the
sheep
nearly
live
in
that
gully
all
the
same
we
raced
the
wind
had
gone
down
by
now
so
the
fire
could
travel
as
fast
as
it
had
done
in
the
open
ground
there
was
a
long
slope
leading
down
to
the
gully
and
as
we
got
to
this
we
could
see
the
whole
of
the
little
paddock
and
there
was
a
sheep
in
sight
every
blessed
one
was
in
the
gully
and
the
fire
was
of
the
way
along
it
roast
mutton
i
heard
dad
say
under
his
breath
then
we
saw
norah
she
came
racing
on
bobs
to
the
fence
of
the
paddock
near
the
head
of
the
gully
much
nearer
the
fire
than
we
were
we
saw
her
look
at
the
fire
and
into
the
gully
and
i
reckon
we
all
knew
she
was
fighting
with
her
promise
to
dad
about
not
tackling
the
fire
but
she
saw
the
sheep
before
we
could
they
had
run
from
the
smoke
along
the
gully
till
they
came
to
the
head
of
it
where
it
ended
with
pretty
steep
banks
all
round
by
that
time
they
were
thoroughly
dazed
and
there
they
would
have
stayed
until
they
were
roasted
sheep
are
stupid
brutes
at
any
time
but
in
smoke
they
just
idiots
norah
gave
only
one
look
then
she
slipped
off
bobs
and
left
him
to
look
after
himself
and
she
tore
down
into
the
oh
jim
go
on
said
wally
i
going
said
jim
affably
dad
gave
one
shout
as
norah
disappeared
into
the
gully
back
my
darling
he
yelled
forgetting
that
he
was
so
far
off
that
he
might
as
well
have
shouted
to
the
moon
then
he
gave
a
groan
and
dug
his
spurs
into
bosun
i
had
mine
as
far
as
they
go
in
sirdar
already
the
smoke
rolled
on
up
the
gully
and
in
a
minute
it
had
covered
it
all
up
i
thought
it
was
all
up
with
norah
too
and
old
burrows
behind
me
was
sobbing
for
all
he
was
worth
we
raced
and
tore
and
yelled
then
we
saw
a
sheep
coming
up
out
of
the
smoke
at
the
end
of
the
gully
another
followed
and
another
and
then
more
until
every
blessed
one
of
the
twenty
was
there
though
we
did
stop
to
count
then
i
can
tell
you
last
of
all
it
just
seemed
years
came
norah
we
could
hear
her
shouting
at
the
sheep
before
we
saw
her
they
were
terribly
hard
to
move
she
banged
them
with
sticks
and
the
last
old
ram
she
fairly
kicked
up
the
hill
they
were
just
out
of
the
gully
when
the
fire
roared
up
it
and
a
minute
or
so
after
that
we
got
to
her
poor
little
kid
she
was
just
black
and
nearly
blind
with
the
smoke
it
was
making
her
cry
like
fun
said
jim
quite
unconscious
of
his
inappropriate
simile
i
do
know
if
it
was
smoke
in
his
case
but
so
was
dad
we
put
the
fire
out
quick
enough
it
was
easy
work
to
keep
it
in
the
gully
indeed
dad
never
looked
at
the
fire
or
the
sheep
either
he
just
jumped
off
bosun
and
picked
norah
up
and
held
her
as
if
she
was
a
baby
and
she
hugged
and
hugged
him
they
awfully
fond
of
each
other
dad
and
and
were
the
sheep
all
right
harry
asked
right
as
rain
not
one
of
the
beauties
singed
it
was
a
pretty
close
thing
you
know
jim
said
reminiscently
the
fire
was
just
up
to
norah
as
she
got
the
last
sheep
up
the
hill
there
was
a
hole
burnt
in
the
leg
of
her
riding
skirt
she
told
me
afterwards
she
made
up
her
mind
she
was
going
to
die
down
in
that
beastly
my
word
you
must
have
been
jolly
proud
of
her
wally
exclaimed
such
a
kid
too
i
guess
we
were
pretty
proud
jim
said
quietly
all
the
people
about
made
no
end
of
a
fuss
about
her
but
norah
never
seemed
to
think
a
pennyworth
about
it
fact
is
her
only
thought
at
first
was
that
dad
would
think
she
had
broken
her
promise
to
him
she
looked
up
at
him
in
the
first
few
minutes
with
her
poor
swollen
old
eyes
did
forget
my
promise
dad
dear
she
said
never
touched
the
fire
only
chased
your
silly
old
sheep
was
that
the
end
of
the
fire
harry
asked
well
nearly
of
course
we
had
to
watch
the
burning
logs
and
stumps
for
a
few
days
until
all
danger
of
more
fires
was
over
and
if
there
been
a
high
wind
in
that
time
we
might
have
had
trouble
luckily
there
any
wind
at
all
and
three
days
after
there
came
a
heavy
fall
of
rain
which
made
everything
safe
we
lost
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
acres
of
grass
but
in
no
time
the
paddock
was
green
again
and
the
fire
only
did
it
good
in
the
long
run
we
reckoned
ourselves
uncommonly
lucky
over
the
whole
thing
though
if
norah
had
saved
the
shropshires
we
have
had
to
sing
a
different
tune
dad
said
he
never
shut
up
so
much
money
in
one
small
paddock
again
jim
bobbed
his
float
up
and
down
despairingly
this
is
the
most
fishless
creek
he
said
well
the
only
thing
left
to
tell
you
is
where
the
swagman
came
oh
by
jove
harry
said
i
forgot
the
was
it
his
fault
the
fire
started
inquired
wally
rather
he
camped
under
a
bridge
on
the
road
that
forms
our
boundary
the
night
dad
cleared
him
off
the
place
and
the
next
morning
very
early
he
deliberately
lit
our
grass
in
three
places
and
then
made
off
he
have
got
away
too
and
nobody
would
have
known
anything
about
it
if
it
had
been
for
len
morrison
you
chaps
have
met
len
have
you
he
a
jolly
nice
fellow
older
than
me
i
guess
he
about
sixteen
now
perhaps
seventeen
len
had
a
favourite
cow
a
great
pet
of
his
he
petted
her
as
a
calf
and
she
follow
him
about
like
a
dog
this
cow
was
sick
they
found
her
down
in
the
paddock
and
could
move
her
so
they
doctored
her
where
she
was
len
was
awfully
worried
about
her
and
used
to
go
to
her
late
at
night
and
first
thing
in
the
morning
he
went
out
to
the
cow
on
this
particular
morning
about
daylight
she
was
dead
and
so
he
did
stay
and
he
was
riding
back
when
he
saw
the
lighting
our
grass
it
was
most
deliberately
done
len
go
after
him
then
he
galloped
up
to
his
own
place
and
gave
the
alarm
and
then
he
and
one
of
their
men
cleared
out
after
the
did
they
catch
him
wally
eyes
were
dancing
and
his
sinker
waved
unconsciously
in
the
air
they
could
see
a
sign
of
him
jim
said
the
road
was
a
plain
straight
one
you
chaps
know
it
the
one
we
drove
home
on
from
the
train
no
cover
anywhere
that
would
hide
so
much
as
a
goat
not
even
you
wal
they
followed
it
up
for
a
couple
of
miles
and
then
saw
that
he
must
have
gone
across
country
somewhere
there
was
mighty
little
cover
there
either
the
only
possible
was
along
the
creek
he
was
pretty
cunning
my
word
he
was
he
started
up
the
road
len
had
seen
him
and
then
he
cut
over
the
paddock
at
an
angle
back
to
the
creek
that
was
why
they
could
find
any
tracks
when
they
started
up
the
creek
from
the
road
and
they
made
sure
he
had
given
them
the
slip
altogether
len
and
the
other
fellow
a
chap
called
sam
baker
pegged
away
up
the
creek
as
hard
as
they
could
go
but
feeling
pretty
blue
about
catching
the
swaggie
len
was
particularly
wild
because
he
made
so
certain
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
the
fellow
and
if
he
had
been
sure
of
course
he
have
stayed
to
help
at
the
fire
and
he
did
like
being
done
out
of
everything
they
could
understand
not
finding
any
tracks
course
it
possible
he
walked
in
the
water
baker
said
have
caught
him
by
now
if
he
had
len
said
could
get
along
quickly
in
the
water
anyhow
if
i
do
see
anything
of
him
before
we
get
to
the
next
bend
i
going
back
to
the
fire
they
were
nearly
up
to
the
bend
and
len
was
feeling
desperate
when
he
saw
a
down
the
bank
on
the
other
side
he
was
over
like
a
shot
the
creek
was
very
shallow
and
there
were
tracks
as
plain
as
possible
leading
down
to
the
water
you
can
bet
they
went
on
then
they
caught
him
a
bit
farther
up
he
heard
them
coming
and
left
his
swag
so
he
could
get
on
quicker
they
caught
that
first
and
then
they
caught
him
he
had
in
a
clump
of
scrub
and
they
nearly
passed
him
but
len
caught
sight
of
him
and
they
had
him
in
a
did
he
come
easily
asked
wally
rather
not
he
sent
old
len
flying
gave
him
an
awful
black
eye
len
was
up
again
and
at
him
like
a
shot
and
i
reckon
it
was
jolly
plucky
of
a
chap
of
len
age
and
i
dare
say
he
have
had
an
awful
hiding
if
sam
had
arrived
on
the
scene
sam
is
a
big
silent
chap
and
he
can
fight
anybody
in
this
district
he
landed
the
swaggie
first
with
one
fist
and
then
with
the
other
and
the
swaggie
reckoned
he
been
struck
by
a
thunderbolt
when
they
fished
him
out
of
the
creek
where
he
had
rolled
you
see
sam
very
fond
of
len
and
it
annoyed
him
to
see
his
eye
the
swaggie

any
more
resisting
he
was
like
a
drowned
rat
len
and
sam
brought
him
up
to
the
men
at
the
fire
just
after
we
left
to
try
to
save
dad
shropshires
and
they
and
morrison
could
hardly
keep
the
men
off
him
he
hid
behind
sam
and
cried
and
begged
them
to
protect
him
they
said

said
wally
standing
on
one
leg
on
the
log
that
this
meeting
do
adjourn
from
this
dead
tree
and
i
move

along

hurled

furiously
from

bank
the
enemy
followed
closely
and
shortly
the
painful
spectacle
might
have
been
seen
of
a
host
lying
flat
on
his
face
on
the
grass
while
his
guests
sitting
on
his
back
bumped
up
and
down

extreme
discomfort

chapter
vii
what
norah
found
norah
meanwhile
had
been
feeling
somewhat
out
of
it
was
really
more
than
human
nature
could
be
expected
to
bear
that
she
should
remain
on
the
log
with
the
three
boys
while
jim
told
amazing
yarns
about
her
still
it
was
decidedly
lonesome
in
the
jutting
root
of
the
old
tree
looking
fixedly
at
the
water
in
which
placidly
lay
a
float
that
had
apparently
forgotten
that
the
first
duty
of
a
float
is
to
bob
jim
voice
murmuring
along
in
his
lengthy
recital
came
to
her
softly
and
she
could
see
from
her
perch
the
interested
faces
of
the
two
others
it
mingled
drowsily
with
the
dull
drone
of
bees
in
the
behind
her
and
presently
norah
to
her
disgust
found
that
she
was
growing
drowsy
too
this
wo
do
she
reflected
shaking
herself
if
i
go
to
sleep
and
tumble
off
this
old
root
i
startle
away
all
the
fish
in
the
she
looked
doubtfully
at
the
still
water
now
and
then
rippled
by
the
splash
of
a
leaping
fish
no
good
when
they
jump
like
that
said
norah
to
herself
i
guess
i
go
and
she
wound
up
her
line
quickly
and
flung
her
bait
to
the
lazy
inhabitants
of
the
creek
as
a
parting
gift
then
unnoticed
by
the
boys
she
scrambled
out
of
the
tree
and
climbed
up
the
bank
getting
her
blue
decidedly
muddy
not
that
norah
free
and
independent
soul
had
ever
learned
to
tremble
at
the
sight
of
muddy
garments
she
hid
her
fishing
tackle
in
a
stump
and
made
her
way
along
the
bank
a
little
farther
up
she
came
across
black
billy
a
very
cheerful
aboriginal
seeing
that
he
had
managed
to
induce
no
less
than
nine
blackfish
to
leave
their
watery
bed
oh
i
say
said
norah
and
envious
how
do
you
manage
it
billy
we
ca
catch
billy
grinned
he
was
a
youth
of
few
words
plenty
float
he
explained
lucidly
easy
you
no
thanks
said
norah
though
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
i
sick
of
trying
and
i
no
luck
going
to
cook
for
dinner
billy
plenty
assented
billy
vigorously
it
was
his
favourite
word
and
meant
almost
anything
and
he
rarely
used
another
when
he
could
make
it
suffice
that
a
good
boy
said
norah
approvingly
and
black
eighteen
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
with
pleasure
at
the
praise
of
white
i
going
for
a
walk
billy
tell
master
jim
to
when
lunch
is
plenty
said
billy
intelligently
norah
turned
from
the
creek
and
entered
the
scrub
she
loved
the
bush
and
was
never
happier
than
when
exploring
its
recesses
a
born
bushmaid
she
had
never
any
difficulty
about
finding
her
way
in
the
scrub
or
of
retracing
her
steps
the
faculty
of
bushmanship
must
be
born
in
you
if
you
have
it
not
naturally
training
very
rarely
gives
it
she
rambled
on
aimlessly
noting
though
scarcely
conscious
that
she
did
so
the
bush
sights
and
scenes
on
either
hand
clinging
creepers
and
twining
plants
dainty
ferns
nestling
in
hollow
trees
clusters
of
maidenhair
under
logs
pheasants
that
hopped
noiselessly
in
the
shade
and
a
wallaby
track
in
some
moist
soft
earth
once
she
saw
a
carpet
snake
lying
coiled
in
a
tussock
and
springing
for
a
stick
she
ran
at
it
but
the
snake
was
too
quick
for
her
and
she
was
only
in
time
to
hit
at
its
tail
as
it
whisked
down
a
hole
norah
wandered
on
feeling
disgusted
with
herself
suddenly
she
stopped
in
amazement
she
was
on
the
edge
of
a
small
clear
space
at
the
farther
side
of
which
was
a
huge
tree
tall
trees
ringed
it
round
and
the
whole
space
was
in
deep
shade
norah
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
in
surprise
for
at
the
foot
of
the
big
was
a
strange
sight
in
that
lonely
place
it
was
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
small
tent
the
flap
of
the
tent
was
down
and
there
were
no
inhabitants
to
be
seen
but
all
about
were
signs
of
occupation
a
billy
hung
from
the
close
to
the
tent
was
a
heap
of
dry
sticks
and
a
little
farther
away
the
ashes
of
a
fire
still
smouldered
and
over
them
a
blackened
bough
supported
by
two
forked
sticks
showed
that
the
billy
had
many
times
been
boiled
there
the
little
camp
was
all
very
neat
and
tidy
it
looks
quite
said
norah
to
herself
as
she
watched
the
flap
of
the
tent
was
raised
and
a
very
old
man
came
out
he
was
so
tall
that
he
had
to
bend
almost
double
in
stooping
under
the
canvas
of
the
low
tent
a
queer
old
man
norah
thought
him
as
she
drew
back
instinctively
into
the
shadow
of
the
trees
when
he
straightened
himself
he
was
wonderfully
tall
taller
even
than
dad
who
was
over
six
feet
he
wore
no
hat
and
his
hair
and
beard
were
very
long
and
as
white
as
snow
under
bushy
white
eyebrows
a
pair
of
bright
blue
eyes
twinkled
norah
decided
that
they
were
nice
eyes
but
he
certainly
was
queer
his
clothes
would
hardly
have
passed
muster
in
collins
street
and
would
even
have
attracted
attention
in
cunjee
he
was
dressed
entirely
in
skins
wallaby
skins
norah
guessed
though
there
was
an
occasional
section
that
looked
like
they
look
bad
either
she
thought
a
kind
of
sleeved
waistcoat
and
loose
trousers
that
were
met
at
the
knee
by
gaiters
or
leggings
still
the
whole
effect
was
startling
the
old
man
walked
across
to
his
fire
and
kneeling
down
carefully
raked
away
the
ashes
then
he
drew
out
a
damper
norah
had
never
seen
one
before
but
she
knew
immediately
that
it
was
a
damper
it
looked
good
too
nicely
risen
and
brown
and
it
sent
forth
a
fragrance
that
was
decidedly
appetizing
the
old
man
looked
pleased
not
half
bad
he
said
aloud
in
a
wonderfully
deep
voice
which
sounded
so
amazing
in
the
bush
silence
that
norah
fairly
jumped
the
old
man
raked
the
ashes
together
again
and
placed
some
sticks
on
them
after
which
he
brought
over
the
billy
and
hung
it
above
the
fire
to
boil
the
fire
quickly
broke
into
a
blaze
and
he
picked
up
the
damper
again
and
walked
slowly
back
to
the
tent
where
he
paused
to
blow
the
dust
from
the
result
of
his
cookery
at
this
moment
norah
became
oppressed
with
a
wild
desire
to
sneeze
she
fought
against
it
frantically
nearly
choking
in
her
efforts
to
remain
silent
while
she
wildly
explored
in
her
pockets
for
a
nonexistent
handkerchief
as
the
water
bursts
from
the
dam
the
more
violently
because
of
its
imprisonment
so
norah
sneeze
gained
intensity
and
uproar
from
her
efforts
to
repress
it
it
came
a
tish
oo
oo
the
old
man
started
violently
he
dropped
his
damper
and
gazed
round
what
on
earth
that
he
said
who
there
for
a
moment
norah
hesitated
should
she
run
for
her
life
but
a
second
thought
showed
her
no
real
reason
why
she
should
run
she
was
not
in
the
least
frightened
for
it
never
occurred
to
norah
that
anyone
could
wish
to
hurt
her
and
she
had
done
nothing
to
make
him
angry
so
she
modestly
emerged
from
behind
a
friendly
tree
and
said
meekly
it
is
it
said
the
old
man
in
great
astonishment
he
stared
hard
at
the
little
figure
in
the
blue
blouse
and
serge
at
the
merry
face
and
the
dark
curls
crowned
by
the
shady
panama
hat
he
repeated
looks
rather
nice
i
think
but
what
she
doing
here
i
was
looking
at
you
norah
exclaimed
i
wo
be
unpolite
enough
to
mention
that
a
cat
may
look
at
a
king
said
the
old
man
but
do
you
know
that
no
one
comes
here
no
young
ladies
in
blue
dresses
and
brown
curls
only
wombats
and
wallabies
and
and
me
not
you
me
but
me
me
how
do
you
account
for
being
here
norah
laughed
she
decided
that
she
liked
this
very
peculiar
old
man
whose
eyes
twinkled
so
brightly
as
he
spoke
but
i
do
think
you
know
she
said
quite
a
lot
of
other
people
come
here
this
is
anglers
bend
at
least
anglers
bend
quite
close
to
your
camp
why
only
there
jim
and
the
boys
and
black
billy
and
me
we
not
wallabies
jim
and
the
boys
and
black
billy
and
me
echoed
the
old
man
faintly
angels
and
ministers
of
grace
defend
us
and
i
thought
i
had
found
the
back
of
beyond
where
i
would
never
see
anyone
more
civilized
than
a
bunyip
but
i
been
here
for
three
months
little
lady
and
have
never
come
across
anyone
are
you
sure
you
quite
serious
quite
norah
answered
perhaps
it
was
that
no
one
came
across
you
you
know
because
people
really
do
come
here
to
fish
dad
and
i
camp
here
sometimes
but
we
have
been
for
more
than
three
well
i
must
move
that
all
said
the
old
man
i
do
like
quiet
it
annoying
enough
to
have
to
dress
up
and
go
into
a
township
now
and
then
for
stores
how
do
you
like
my
clothes
by
the
way
i
may
as
well
have
a
feminine
opinion
while
i
have
the
did
you
make
them
yourself
asked
norah
behold
how
she
fences
said
the
old
man
i
did
indeed
then
they
do
you
proud
said
norah
solemnly
the
old
man
laughed
i
shall
prize
your
expression
of
opinion
he
said
may
i
ask
the
name
of
my
visitor
i
norah
please
who
are
you
that
a
different
matter
said
the
other
looking
nonplussed
i
certainly
had
a
name
once
but
i
quite
forgotten
it
i
have
an
excellent
memory
for
forgetting
would
you
think
i
was
a
bunyip
i
be
delighted
if
you
could
i
norah
shook
her
head
but
i
tell
you
what
i
think
you
a
hermit
the
old
man
face
cleared
my
dear
miss
norah
he
said
you
made
a
profound
discovery
i
am
i
am
a
hermit
thank
you
very
much
being
a
hermit
my
resources
are
scanty
but
may
i
hope
that
you
will
have
lunch
with
me
i
ca
i
afraid
said
norah
looking
affectionately
at
the
damper
the
boys
will
be
looking
for
me
if
i
do
go
back
listen
jim
now
and
who
may
jim
be
queried
the
hermit
a
trifle
uneasily
jim
my
brother
norah
said
he
fifteen
and
he
just
splendid
harry
and
wally
are
his
two
norah
answered
the
call
quickly
and
turned
to
the
hermit
feeling
a
little
apologetic
i
had
to
call
she
explained
jim
would
be
anxious
they
want
me
for
she
hesitated
wo
you
come
too
she
asked
timidly
i
have
eaten
with
my
for
more
time
than
i
care
to
reckon
said
the
hermit
i
do
know
will
they
let
me
alone
afterwards
are
they
ordinary
abominable
boys
indeed
they
not
said
norah
indignantly
they
wo
come
near
you
at
all
if
you
do
want
them
but
i
know
they
be
pleased
if
you
came
do
jim
getting
impatient
is
he
said
the
hermit
well
miss
norah
if
you
excuse
my
attire
i
come
shall
i
bring
my
damper
oh
please
norah
cried
we
never
tasted
i
wish
had
said
the
hermit
grimly
he
picked
up
the
fallen
cake
let
us
away
he
said
the
banquet
waits
during
their
walk
through
the
scrub
it
occurred
to
norah
once
or
twice
to
wonder
if
her
companion
were
really
a
little
mad
he
said
such
extraordinary
things
all
in
the
most
tone
but
when
she
looked
up
at
him
his
blue
eyes
twinkled
so
kindly
and
merrily
that
she
knew
at
once
he
was
all
right
and
she
was
quite
certain
that
she
liked
him
very
much
the
boys
were
getting
impatient
lunch
was
ready
and
when
lunch
has
been
prepared
by
brown
and
supplemented
by
fresh
blackfish
fried
over
a
camp
fire
by
black
billy
it
is
not
a
meal
to
be
kept
waiting
they
were
grouped
round
the
in
attitudes
more
suggestive
of
ease
than
elegance
when
norah
and
her
escort
appeared
and
for
once
their
manners
deserted
them
they
gaped
in
silent
amazement
boys
this
is
the
hermit
said
norah
rather
nervously
i
i
found
him
he
has
a
camp
he
come
to
i
must
apologize
for
my
intrusion
i
afraid
the
hermit
said
miss
norah
was
good
enough
to
ask
me
to
come
i
i
brought
my
damper
he
exhibited
the
article
half
shyly
and
the
boys
recovered
themselves
and
laughed
uncontrollably
jim
sprang
to
his
feet
the
hermit
first
words
had
told
him
that
this
was
no
common
swagman
that
norah
had
picked
up
i
very
glad
to
see
you
sir
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
thank
you
said
the
hermit
gravely
you
jim
are
you
and
i
conclude
that
this
gentleman
is
harry
and
this
wally
ah
i
thought
so
yes
i
have
seen
so
many
people
for
ages
and
black
billy
how
are
you
billy
billy
retreated
in
great
embarrassment
plenty
he
murmured
everybody
laughed
again
well
jim
said
we
hungry
norah
i
hope
you
and
er
this
gentleman
jim
was
concealing
his
bewilderment
like
a
hero
you
sit
down
and
sample
billy
blackfish
he
caught
all
we
could
raise
a
bite
between
us
barring
wally
boot
did
you
catch
a
boot
queried
the
hermit
of
the
blushing
wally
mine
i
think
i
ca
congratulate
you
on
your
luck
if
you
like
after
lunch
i
show
you
a
place
where
you
could
catch
fish
if
you
only
held
the
end
of
your
finger
in
the
water
good
enough
said
jim
thanks
awfully
we
be
jolly
glad
come
on
billy
trot
out
your
lunch
began
rather
silently
in
their
secret
hearts
the
boys
were
rather
annoyed
with
norah
why
on
earth
jim
reflected
could
she
have
left
the
old
chap
alone
the
party
was
all
right
without
him
we
did
want
any
one
else
least
of
all
an
odd
oddity
like
and
though
the
other
boys
were
loyal
to
norah
she
certainly
suffered
a
fall
in
their
estimation
and
was
classed
for
the
moment
with
the
usual
run
of
girls
who
do
rummy
however
the
hermit
was
a
man
of
penetration
and
soon
realized
the
state
of
the
social
barometer
his
hosts
who
did
not
look
at
all
like
quiet
boys
were
eating
their
blackfish
in
perfect
silence
save
for
polite
requests
for
bread
or
pepper
or
the
occasional
courteous
remark
chuck
us
the
salt
accordingly
the
hermit
exerted
himself
to
please
and
it
would
really
have
taken
more
than
three
crabby
boys
to
resist
him
he
told
the
drollest
stories
which
sent
everyone
into
fits
of
laughter
although
he
never
laughed
himself
at
all
and
he
talked
about
the
bush
and
told
them
of
the
queer
animals
he
saw
having
as
he
said
unusually
good
opportunities
for
watching
the
bush
inhabitants
unseen
he
knew
where
the
lyrebirds
danced
and
had
often
crept
silently
through
the
scrub
until
he
could
command
a
view
of
the
mound
where
these
strange
birds
strutted
and
danced
and
mimicked
the
other
birds
with
fidelity
he
loved
the
birds
very
much
and
never
killed
any
of
them
even
when
a
pair
of
thievish
magpies
attacked
his
larder
and
pecked
a
damper
into
little
bits
when
he
was
away
fishing
many
of
the
birds
were
tame
with
him
now
he
said
they
would
hop
about
the
camp
and
let
him
feed
them
and
he
had
a
carpet
snake
that
was
quite
a
pet
which
he
offered
to
show
them
an
offer
that
broke
down
the
last
tottering
barriers
of
the
boys
reserve
then
there
were
his
different
methods
of
trapping
animals
some
of
which
were
strange
even
to
jim
who
was
a
trapper
of
much
renown
do
you
get
lonely
sometimes
norah
asked
him
the
hermit
looked
at
her
gravely
sometimes
he
said
now
and
then
one
feels
that
one
would
give
something
to
hear
a
human
voice
again
and
to
feel
a
friend
oh
there
are
times
miss
norah
when
i
talk
to
myself
which
is
bad
or
yarn
to
old
turpentine
my
snake
just
to
hear
the
sound
of
words
again
however
when
these
bad
fits
come
upon
me
i
know
it
a
sign
that
i
must
get
the
axe
and
go
and
chop
down
sufficient
trees
to
make
me
tired
then
i
go
to
sleep
and
wake
up
quite
a
cheerful
being
once
more
he
hesitated
and
there
one
thing
he
said
slowly
though
it
may
be
lonely
here
there
is
no
one
to
trouble
you
no
one
to
treat
you
badly
to
be
ungrateful
or
malicious
no
bitter
enemies
and
no
false
friends
who
are
so
much
worse
than
enemies
the
birds
come
and
hop
about
me
and
i
know
that
it
is
because
i
like
them
and
have
never
frightened
them
old
turpentine
slides
his
ugly
head
over
my
knees
and
i
know
he
care
a
button
whether
i
have
any
money
in
my
pocket
or
whether
i
have
to
go
out
into
the
scrub
to
find
my
next
meal
and
that
far
far
more
than
you
can
say
of
most
human
beings
he
looked
round
on
their
grave
faces
and
smiled
for
the
first
time
this
is
uncommonly
bad
behaviour
in
a
guest
he
said
cheerily
to
come
to
lunch
and
regale
one
host
and
hostess
with
a
sermon
it
too
bad
i
ask
your
forgiveness
young
people
and
please
forget
all
i
said
immediately
no
miss
norah
i
wo
have
any
damper
thank
you
after
a
three
months
course
of
damper
one
looks
with
joy
once
more
on
bread
if
wally
will
favour
me
i
think
the
correct
phrase
is
will
you
me
the
butter
whereat
wally
chucked
as
desired
and
the
meal
proceeded
merrily
chapter
viii
on
a
log
lunch
over
everyone
seemed
disinclined
for
action
the
boys
lay
about
on
the
grass
sleepily
happy
norah
climbed
into
a
tree
where
the
gnarled
boughs
made
a
natural
and
the
hermit
propped
his
back
against
a
rock
and
smoked
a
short
black
pipe
with
an
air
of
perfect
enjoyment
it
was
just
hot
enough
to
make
one
drowsy
bees
droned
lazily
and
from
some
shady
gully
the
shrill
note
of
a
cricket
came
faintly
to
the
ear
only
billy
had
stolen
down
to
the
creek
to
tempt
the
fish
once
more
they
heard
the
dull
plunk
of
his
sinker
as
he
flung
it
into
a
deep
still
pool
would
you
like
to
hear
how
i
lost
my
boot
queried
the
hermit
suddenly
oh
please
said
norah
the
boys
rolled
over
that
is
to
say
jim
and
wally
rolled
over
harry
was
fast
asleep
do
wake
him
said
the
hermit
but
wally
hat
skilfully
thrown
had
already
caught
the
slumberer
on
the
side
of
the
head
harry
woke
up
with
surprising
promptness
and
returned
the
offending
with
force
and
directness
wally
caught
it
deftly
and
rammed
it
over
his
eyes
he
smiled
underneath
it
at
the
hermit
like
a
happy
cherub
now
we
ready
sir
he
said
hold
your
row
harry
the
this
gentleman
going
to
spin
us
a
yarn
keep
awake
if
you
can
spare
the
time
i
spare
the
time
to
kick
you
growled
the
indignant
harry
i
do
know
that
you
think
it
much
of
a
yarn
the
hermit
said
hurriedly
entering
the
breach
to
endeavour
to
allay
further
discussion
somewhat
to
jim
disappointment
it
only
the
story
of
a
pretty
narrow
escape
i
had
gone
out
fishing
one
afternoon
about
a
month
ago
it
was
a
grand
day
for
fishing
dull
and
cloudy
the
sun
was
about
somewhere
but
you
could
see
anything
of
him
although
you
could
feel
his
warmth
been
off
colour
for
a
few
days
and
had
not
been
out
foraging
at
all
and
as
a
result
except
for
damper
my
larder
was
quite
empty
i
went
about
a
mile
upstream
there
a
splendid
place
for
fishing
there
the
creek
widens
and
there
a
still
deep
pool
something
like
the
pool
at
the
place
you
call
anglers
bend
only
i
think
mine
is
deeper
and
stiller
and
fishier
at
all
events
i
have
never
failed
to
get
fish
there
i
fished
from
the
bank
for
a
while
with
not
very
good
luck
at
all
events
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
could
better
it
if
i
went
out
upon
a
big
log
that
lay
right
across
the
creek
a
tremendous
tree
it
must
have
been
judging
by
the
size
of
the
trunk
you
could
almost
ride
across
it
it
so
wide
if
you
had
a
circus
pony
that
is
added
the
hermit
with
a
twinkle
so
i
gathered
up
my
tackle
hung
the
fish
i
caught
across
a
bough
in
the
shade
and
went
out
on
the
log
and
here
i
had
good
luck
at
once
the
fish
bit
just
as
soon
as
i
put
the
bait
into
the
water
and
though
a
good
many
of
them
were
small
there
were
some
very
ones
amongst
them
i
threw
the
little
chaps
back
on
the
principle
that
baby
fish
you
throw
away
will
make
good
sport
another
day
and
at
last
began
to
think
i
had
caught
nearly
enough
even
though
i
intended
to
salt
some
however
just
as
i
thought
it
was
time
to
strike
for
camp
i
had
a
tremendous
bite
it
nearly
jerked
the
rod
out
of
my
hands
i
said
to
myself
a
whale
i
played
him
for
a
bit
for
he
was
the
strongest
fish
i
ever
had
on
a
line
in
this
country
and
at
last
he
began
to
tire
and
i
reeled
the
line
in
it
seemed
quite
a
long
time
before
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
lordship
a
tremendous
perch
i
tell
you
i
felt
quite
proud
as
his
head
came
up
out
of
the
water
he
was
nearly
up
to
the
log
when
he
made
a
sudden
last
leap
in
the
air
and
the
quickness
of
it
and
his
weight
half
threw
me
off
my
balance
i
made
a
hurried
step
on
the
log
and
my
right
foot
slipped
into
a
huge
gaping
crack
it
was
only
after
i
had
made
two
or
three
ineffectual
struggles
to
release
it
that
i
found
i
was
stuck
well
i
did
realize
the
seriousness
of
the
position
for
a
few
minutes
the
hermit
went
on
i
could
understand
that
i
was
wedged
but
i
certainly
never
dreamed
that
i
could
not
by
dint
of
manoeuvring
wriggle
my
foot
out
of
the
crack
so
i
turned
my
attention
to
my
big
fish
and
standing
in
a
most
uncomfortable
position
managed
to
land
him
and
a
beauty
he
was
handsome
as
paint
with
queer
markings
on
his
sides
i
put
him
down
carefully
and
then
tried
to
free
myself
and
i
tried
and
tried
and
tried
until
i
was
tired
out
and
stiff
and
hopeless
by
that
time
it
was
nearly
dark
after
i
had
endeavoured
unsuccessfully
to
get
the
boot
clear
i
unlaced
it
and
tried
to
get
my
foot
out
of
it
but
i
was
in
a
trifle
too
far
for
that
and
try
as
i
would
i
could
not
get
it
free
the
crack
was
rather
on
the
side
of
the
log
i
could
not
get
a
straight
pull
hurt
yes
of
course
it
hurt
not
more
from
the
pinching
of
the
log
which
you
may
try
any
time
by
screwing
your
foot
up
in
a
vice
than
from
my
own
wild
efforts
to
get
clear
my
foot
and
ankle
were
stiff
and
sore
from
my
exertions
long
before
i
knocked
off
in
despair
i
might
have
tried
to
cut
the
wood
away
had
i
not
left
my
knife
on
the
bank
where
i
was
fishing
first
i
do
know
that
it
would
have
done
much
good
anyhow
well
i
looked
at
the
situation
in
fact
i
had
been
looking
at
it
all
the
time
it
was
a
very
cheering
prospect
either
the
more
i
pondered
over
it
the
less
chance
i
saw
of
getting
free
i
had
done
all
i
could
towards
that
end
now
it
only
remained
to
wait
for
something
to
up
and
i
was
quite
aware
that
nothing
was
in
the
least
likely
to
turn
up
and
also
that
in
all
probability
i
would
wear
out
some
time
before
the
log
did
night
came
on
and
i
was
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
being
a
hunter
i
knew
just
how
hungry
that
is
i
had
anything
to
eat
except
raw
fish
and
i
was
quite
equal
to
that
yet
i
had
only
one
pipe
of
tobacco
too
and
you
may
be
sure
i
made
the
most
of
that
i
smoked
it
very
very
slowly
and
i
would
like
to
say
how
long
it
lasted
from
time
to
time
i
made
fresh
attempts
to
release
my
foot
all
unavailing
and
all
the
more
maddening
because
i
could
feel
that
my
foot
was
much
caught
only
just
enough
to
hold
it
but
enough
is
as
good
as
a
feast
i
felt
that
if
i
could
get
a
straight
pull
at
it
i
might
get
it
out
and
several
times
i
nearly
went
head
first
into
the
water
overbalancing
myself
in
the
effort
to
get
that
straight
pull
that
was
a
pleasant
sensation
not
so
bad
indeed
if
one
had
got
as
far
as
the
water
but
i
pictured
myself
hanging
from
the
log
with
a
dislocated
ankle
and
the
prospect
was
not
inviting
so
the
night
crept
on
i
grew
deadly
sleepy
but
of
course
i
did
not
care
to
let
myself
go
to
sleep
but
worse
than
that
was
the
stiffness
and
the
cramp
that
tortured
the
imprisoned
leg
you
know
how
you
want
to
jump
when
you
got
cramp
well
i
wanted
to
jump
at
intervals
of
about
a
minute
all
through
that
night
and
instead
i
was
more
securely
hobbled
than
any
old
horse
i
ever
saw
the
mosquitoes
worried
me
too
altogether
it
was
not
the
sort
of
entertainment
you
would
select
from
choice
and
then
just
as
day
began
to
dawn
the
sleepiness
got
the
better
of
me
i
fought
it
unavailingly
but
at
last
i
knew
i
could
keep
awake
no
longer
and
i
shut
my
eyes
i
do
know
how
long
i
slept
it
could
have
been
for
any
time
for
it
was
not
broad
daylight
when
i
opened
my
eyes
again
besides
the
circumstances
were
the
kind
to
induce
calm
and
peaceful
slumber
i
woke
up
with
a
start
and
in
my
dreams
i
seemed
to
hear
myself
crying
out
with
pain
for
a
spasm
of
cramp
had
seized
me
and
it
was
like
a
iron
thrust
up
my
leg
i
was
only
half
awake
not
realizing
my
position
a
bit
i
made
a
sudden
spring
and
the
next
moment
off
i
went
headlong
i
do
suppose
said
the
hermit
reflectively
poking
a
stem
of
grass
down
his
pipe
that
i
ever
lose
the
memory
of
the
sudden
abject
terror
of
that
moment
they
say
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
and
it
certainly
does
take
an
man
long
to
fall
off
one
as
a
rule
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
hours
and
years
waiting
for
the
jerk
to
come
on
my
imprisoned
foot
i
sure
i
lived
through
half
a
lifetime
before
it
really
came
then
it
came
and
i
hardly
felt
it
there
was
just
a
sudden
pull
scarcely
enough
to
hurt
very
much
and
the
old
boot
yielded
sole
from
upper
it
came
clean
away
and
the
pressure
on
my
foot
alone
enough
to
hold
me
it
was
so
unexpected
that
i
did
realize
i
was
free
until
i
struck
the
water
and
went
down
right
into
the
mud
at
the
bottom
of
the
creek
that
woke
me
up
i
can
assure
you
i
came
up
choking
and
spluttering
and
blinded
with
the
mud
i
would
like
to
tell
you
for
a
moment
that
it
was
pleasant
but
i
can
truthfully
say
i
never
was
more
relieved
in
my
life
i
struck
out
for
the
bank
and
got
out
of
the
water
and
then
sat
down
on
the
grass
and
wondered
why
on
earth
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
jump
off
that
log
before
i
had
any
boot
left
the
remainder
had
been
kicked
off
as
i
swam
ashore
i
made
my
way
along
the
log
that
had
held
me
so
fast
all
night
and
there
wedged
as
tight
as
ever
in
the
crack
was
my
old
sole
there
still
unless
the
mosquitoes
have
eaten
it
i
limped
home
with
my
fish
cleaned
them
had
a
meal
and
went
to
bed
and
i
did
get
up
until
next
day
either
and
so
wally
i
venture
to
think
that
it
was
my
boot
that
you
landed
this
morning
the
hermit
said
gravely
i
do
grudge
it
to
you
i
ca
say
i
ever
wish
to
see
it
again
you
magnanimously
may
have
it
for
your
very
own
but
i
chucked
it
back
again
blurted
out
wally
amidst
a
roar
of
laughter
from
jim
and
harry
at
his
dismayed
face
i
forgive
you
said
the
hermit
joining
in
the
laugh
i
admit
it
was
a
relic
which
did
advertise
its
own
i
guess
you
never
want
to
see
it
again
jim
said
that
was
a
pretty
narrow
escape
if
your
foot
had
been
in
just
a
bit
farther
you
might
have
been
hanging
from
that
old
log
now
that
was
my
own
idea
all
that
night
observed
the
hermit
and
then
wally
would
have
caught
any
more
than
the
rest
of
you
this
morning
and
that
reminds
me
i
promised
to
show
you
a
good
you
think
if
you
had
enough
of
my
prosy
yarning
that
we
better
make
a
start
the
party
gathered
itself
up
with
alacrity
from
the
grass
lines
were
hurriedly
examined
and
the
bait
tin
when
investigated
proved
to
contain
an
ample
supply
of
succulent
grubs
and
other
dainties
calculated
to
tempt
the
most
fastidious
of
fish
all
ready
said
the
hermit
hold
on
a
minute
jim
said
i
let
billy
know
where
we
billy
was
found
fishing
stolidly
from
a
log
three
blackfish
testified
to
his
skill
with
the
rod
at
which
wally
whistled
disgustedly
and
norah
laughed
no
good
to
be
jealous
of
billy
luck
she
said
he
can
always
get
fish
when
nobody
else
can
find
even
a
nibble
brown
says
he
got
the
light
hand
like
hers
for
the
hermit
laughed
i
like
brown
simile
he
said
if
that
was
her
pastry
in
those
turnovers
at
lunch
miss
norah
i
certainly
agree
that
she
has
light
hand
mrs
brown
like
the
cook
in
ingoldsby
dad
says
norah
remarked
what
said
the
hermit
for
soups
and
stews
and
french
regouts
nell
cook
is
famous
still
finished
norah
delightedly
however
did
you
know
hermit
the
hermit
laughed
but
a
shade
crossed
his
brow
i
used
to
read
the
with
a
dear
old
friend
many
years
before
you
were
born
miss
norah
he
said
gravely
i
often
wonder
whether
he
still
reads
ready
jim
interrupted
springing
up
the
bank
billy
understands
about
feeding
the
ponies
do
forget
mind
plenty
quoth
billy
and
the
party
went
on
its
way
the
hermit
led
them
rapidly
over
logs
and
fallen
trees
up
and
down
gullies
and
through
tangles
of
thickly
growing
scrub
once
or
twice
it
occurred
to
jim
that
they
were
trusting
very
confidingly
to
this
man
of
whom
they
knew
absolutely
nothing
and
a
faint
shade
of
uneasiness
crossed
his
mind
he
felt
responsible
as
the
eldest
of
the
youngsters
knowing
that
his
father
had
placed
him
in
charge
and
that
he
was
expected
to
exercise
a
certain
amount
of
caution
still
it
was
hard
to
fancy
anything
wrong
looking
at
the
hermit
serene
face
and
the
trusting
way
in
which
norah
brown
little
hand
was
placed
in
his
strong
grasp
the
other
boys
were
quite
unconscious
of
any
uncomfortable
ideas
and
jim
finally
dismissed
his
fears
as
uncalled
for
i
thought
said
the
hermit
suddenly
turning
of
taking
you
to
see
my
camp
as
we
went
but
on
second
thoughts
i
decided
that
it
would
be
better
to
get
straight
to
work
as
you
young
people
want
some
fish
i
suppose
to
take
home
perhaps
we
can
look
in
at
my
camp
as
we
come
back
it
not
far
from
which
way
do
you
generally
go
to
the
river
norah
asked
why
anyway
the
hermit
answered
generally
in
this
direction
why
do
you
ask
miss
norah
i
was
wondering
norah
said
we
have
crossed
or
met
a
single
the
hermit
laughed
no
he
said
i
take
very
good
care
not
to
leave
tracks
if
i
can
avoid
it
you
see
i
a
solitary
fellow
miss
norah
and
prefer
as
a
rule
to
keep
to
myself
apart
from
that
i
often
leave
camp
for
the
greater
part
of
the
day
when
i
fishing
or
hunting
and
i
no
wish
to
point
out
the
way
to
my
domain
to
any
wanderers
not
that
i
much
to
lose
still
there
are
some
things
picture
my
harrowed
feelings
were
i
to
return
some
evening
and
find
my
beloved
gone
norah
laughed
it
would
be
awful
she
said
so
i
planned
my
camp
very
cunningly
continued
the
hermit
and
i
can
tell
you
it
took
some
planning
to
contrive
it
so
that
it
should
be
too
easily
well
it
is
from
the
side
i
came
on
it
norah
put
in
i
never
dreamed
of
anything
being
there
until
i
was
right
on
the
camp
it
did
surprise
me
and
me
said
the
hermit
drily
well
that
is
how
i
tried
to
arrange
camp
and
you
could
be
within
a
dozen
yards
of
it
on
any
side
without
imagining
that
any
was
but
surely
you
must
have
made
some
sort
of
a
track
leading
away
from
it
said
jim
unless
you
fly
out
the
hermit
laughed
i
show
you
later
how
i
manage
that
he
said
the
bush
grew
denser
as
the
little
party
led
by
the
hermit
pushed
along
and
jim
was
somewhat
surprised
at
the
easy
certainty
with
which
their
guide
led
the
way
since
there
was
no
sign
of
a
track
being
a
silent
youth
he
held
his
tongue
on
the
matter
but
wally
was
not
so
reserved
however
find
your
way
along
here
he
asked
i
do
even
know
whether
we
near
the
creek
or
if
we
kept
still
a
moment
you
know
the
hermit
said
listen
he
held
up
his
hand
and
they
all
stood
still
there
came
faintly
to
their
ears
a
musical
splash
of
water
there
a
little
waterfall
just
in
there
the
hermit
said
nothing
much
unless
the
creek
is
very
low
and
then
there
is
a
greater
drop
for
the
water
so
you
see
we
have
got
far
from
the
creek
how
do
i
know
the
way
why
i
feel
it
mostly
and
if
i
could
feel
it
there
are
plenty
of
landmarks
every
big
tree
is
as
good
as
a
signpost
once
you
know
the
way
a
bit
and
i
been
along
here
pretty
often
so
nothing
in
it
you
see
do
you
like
the
bush
hermit
norah
asked
the
hermit
hesitated
sometimes
i
hate
it
i
think
miss
norah
he
said
when
the
loneliness
of
it
comes
over
me
and
all
the
queer
sounds
of
it
bother
me
and
keep
me
awake
then
i
realise
that
i
really
a
good
way
from
anywhere
and
i
get
what
are
familiarly
called
the
blues
however
that
not
at
all
times
and
indeed
mostly
i
love
it
very
much
its
great
quietness
and
its
beauty
and
then
it
so
companionable
though
perhaps
you
a
bit
young
to
understand
that
anyhow
i
have
my
mates
not
only
old
turpentine
my
snake
but
others
wallabies
that
have
come
to
recognise
me
as
harmless
for
i
never
hunt
anywhere
near
home
the
laughing
jackasses
two
of
them
that
come
and
guffaw
to
me
every
morning
the
pheasants
that
i
watch
capering
and
strutting
on
the
logs
hidden
in
the
scrub
even
the
plants
become
friends
there
are
creepers
near
my
camp
that
i
watched
from
babyhood
and
more
than
one
big
tree
with
which
i
at
least
a
nodding
acquaintance
he
broke
off
suddenly
look
there
a
friend
of
mine
he
said
gently
they
were
crossing
a
little
gully
and
a
few
yards
on
their
right
a
big
wallaby
sat
staring
at
them
gravely
inquisitive
it
certainly
would
not
have
been
human
nature
if
jim
had
not
longed
for
a
gun
but
the
wallaby
was
evidently
quite
ignorant
of
such
a
thing
and
took
them
all
in
with
his
cool
stare
at
length
wally
sneezed
violently
whereat
the
wallaby
started
regarded
the
disturber
of
his
peace
with
an
alarmed
air
and
finally
bounded
off
into
the
scrub
there
you
go
said
the
hermit
scaring
my
poor
beastie
out
of
his
could
help
it
mumbled
wally
no
a
sneeze
will
out
like
truth
wo
it
the
hermit
laughed
that
how
miss
norah
announced
herself
to
me
i
might
never
have
known
she
was
there
if
she
had
obligingly
sneezed
i
hope
you
not
getting
colds
children
the
hermit
added
with
mock
concern
not
much
said
wally
and
norah
in
a
breath
just
after
i
came
here
said
the
hermit
i
was
pretty
short
of
tucker
and
it
was
a
good
time
for
fishing
so
i
was
dependent
on
my
gun
for
most
of
my
provisions
so
one
day
feeling
much
annoyed
after
a
breakfast
of
damper
and
jam
i
took
the
gun
and
went
off
to
stock
up
the
larder
i
went
a
good
way
without
any
luck
there
did
seem
anything
to
shoot
in
all
the
bush
though
you
may
be
sure
i
kept
my
eyes
about
me
i
was
beginning
to
grow
disheartened
at
length
i
made
my
way
down
to
the
creek
just
as
i
got
near
it
i
heard
a
over
my
head
and
looking
up
i
saw
a
flock
of
wild
duck
they
seemed
to
pause
a
moment
and
then
dropped
downwards
i
could
see
where
they
alighted
but
of
course
i
knew
it
must
be
in
the
creek
well
i
did
pause
said
the
hermit
i
just
made
my
way
down
to
the
creek
as
quickly
as
ever
i
could
remaining
noiseless
at
the
same
time
ducks
are
easily
scared
and
i
knew
my
hopes
of
dinner
were
poor
if
these
chaps
saw
me
too
soon
so
i
sneaked
down
pretty
soon
i
got
a
glimpse
of
the
creek
which
was
very
wide
at
that
point
and
fringed
with
weeds
the
ducks
were
calmly
swimming
on
its
broad
surface
a
splendid
lot
of
them
and
i
can
assure
you
a
very
tempting
sight
to
a
hungry
man
however
i
did
waste
time
in
admiration
i
could
very
well
risk
a
shot
from
where
i
was
it
was
a
bit
too
far
and
the
old
gun
i
had
was
very
brilliant
so
i
crept
along
crawled
down
a
bank
and
found
myself
on
a
flat
that
ran
to
the
water
edge
where
reeds
growing
thickly
screened
me
from
the
ducks
sight
that
was
simple
enough
i
crawled
across
this
flat
taking
no
chances
careless
of
mud
and
wet
and
sword
grass
which
is
the
nicest
thing
to
crawl
among
at
any
time
as
you
can
imagine
it
absolutely
merciless
to
face
and
and
jolly
awkward
to
stalk
ducks
in
jim
commented
the
rustle
would
give
you
away
in
no
the
hermit
nodded
yes
he
said
that
its
worst
drawback
or
was
on
this
occasion
it
certainly
did
rustle
however
i
crept
very
slowly
and
the
ducks
were
kind
enough
to
think
i
was
the
wind
stirring
in
the
reeds
at
any
rate
they
went
on
swimming
and
feeding
quite
peacefully
i
got
a
good
look
at
them
through
the
fringe
of
reeds
and
then
like
a
duffer
although
i
had
a
good
enough
position
i
must
try
and
get
a
better
one
so
i
crawled
a
little
farther
down
the
bank
trying
to
reach
a
knoll
which
would
give
me
a
fine
sight
of
the
game
and
at
the
same
time
form
a
convenient
rest
for
my
gun
i
had
almost
reached
it
when
the
sad
thing
happened
a
tall
reed
bending
over
gently
and
intrusively
tickled
my
nose
and
without
the
slightest
warning
and
very
greatly
to
my
own
amazement
i
sneezed
violently
if
i
was
amazed
what
were
the
ducks
the
sneeze
was
so
unmistakably
human
so
unspeakably
violent
there
was
one
wild
whirr
of
wings
and
my
ducks
scrambled
off
the
placid
surface
of
the
water
like
things
possessed
i
threw
up
my
gun
and
fired
wildly
there
was
no
time
for
deliberate
taking
of
aim
with
the
birds
already
half
over
the
at
the
other
did
you
get
any
jim
asked
one
duck
said
the
hermit
sadly
and
even
for
him
i
had
to
swim
he
obligingly
chose
a
watery
grave
just
to
spite
me
i
believe
he
much
of
a
duck
either
after
i
had
stripped
and
swum
for
him
dressed
again
prepared
the
duck
cooked
him
and
finally
sat
down
to
dinner
there
was
so
little
of
him
that
he
only
amounted
to
half
a
meal
and
was
tough
at
that
so
was
your
luck
observed
wally
uncommonly
tough
agreed
the
hermit
however
these
things
are
the
fortunes
of
war
and
one
has
to
put
up
with
them
grin
and
play
the
game
it
surprising
how
much
tougher
things
look
if
you
once
begin
to
grumble
i
had
so
much
bad
luck
in
the
bush
that
i
really
got
quite
used
to
how
that
asked
harry
why
said
the
hermit
if
it
was
one
thing
it
was
mostly
another
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
norah
let
me
help
you
over
this
log
i
had
my
tucker
stolen
again
and
again
several
times
by
birds
twice
by
swaggies
and
once
by
a
couple
of
black
fellows
pilgrimaging
through
the
bush
i
do
know
whither
they
happened
on
my
camp
and
helped
themselves
i
reckoned
myself
very
lucky
that
they
only
took
food
though
i
no
doubt
they
would
have
taken
more
if
i
had
arrived
on
the
scene
in
the
nick
of
time
and
scared
them
almost
out
of
their
how
did
you
do
that
asked
norah
tell
us
about
it
hermit
the
hermit
smiled
down
at
norah
eager
face
oh
that
hardly
a
yarn
miss
norah
he
said
his
eyes
twinkling
in
a
way
that
made
them
look
astonishingly
young
despite
his
white
hair
and
his
wrinkles
that
was
only
a
small
happening
though
it
capped
a
day
of
bad
luck
i
had
been
busy
in
camp
all
the
morning
cooking
and
had
laid
in
quite
a
supply
of
tucker
for
me
i
cooked
some
wild
duck
and
roasted
a
hare
boiled
a
most
splendid
and
finally
baked
a
big
damper
and
i
can
tell
you
i
was
patting
myself
on
the
back
because
i
need
not
do
any
more
cooking
for
nearly
a
week
unless
it
were
fish
not
a
cook
by
nature
and
pretty
often
go
hungry
rather
than
prepare
a
meal
after
dinner
i
thought
i
go
down
to
the
creek
and
try
my
luck
it
was
a
perfect
day
for
fishing
still
and
grey
so
i
dug
some
worms
and
broke
my
spade
in
doing
so
and
started
off
the
promise
of
the
day
held
good
i
went
to
my
favourite
spot
and
the
fish
just
rushed
me
the
worms
must
have
been
very
tempting
or
else
the
fish
larder
was
scantily
supplied
at
any
rate
they
bit
splendidly
and
soon
i
grew
fastidious
and
was
picking
out
and
throwing
back
any
that
were
quite
large
enough
i
fished
from
the
old
log
over
the
creek
and
soon
had
a
pile
of
fish
and
grew
tired
of
the
sport
i
was
sleepy
too
through
hanging
over
the
fire
all
the
morning
i
kept
on
fishing
mechanically
but
it
was
little
more
than
holding
my
bait
in
the
water
and
i
began
nodding
and
dozing
leaning
back
on
the
broad
old
log
i
did
think
i
had
really
gone
to
sleep
though
i
suppose
i
must
have
done
so
because
i
dreamed
a
kind
of
dream
in
it
i
saw
a
snake
that
crept
and
crept
nearer
and
nearer
to
me
until
i
could
see
its
wicked
eyes
gleaming
and
though
i
tried
to
get
away
i
could
not
it
came
on
and
on
until
it
was
quite
near
and
i
was
feeling
highly
uncomfortable
in
my
dream
at
last
i
made
a
great
effort
flung
out
my
hand
towards
a
stick
and
with
a
yell
woke
up
to
realise
that
i
had
struck
something
cold
and
clammy
and
wet
what
it
was
i
could
be
certain
for
an
instant
until
i
heard
a
dull
splash
and
then
i
knew
i
had
swept
my
whole
string
of
fish
into
the
water
below
oh
yes
i
said
things
who
would
i
was
too
disgusted
to
fish
any
more
and
the
nightmare
having
thoroughly
roused
me
i
gathered
up
my
tackle
and
made
tracks
for
home
feeling
considerably
annoyed
with
myself
you
must
know
i
a
private
entrance
into
my
camp
it
a
track
no
one
would
suspect
of
being
a
track
and
by
its
aid
i
can
approach
noiselessly
i
got
into
a
habit
of
always
sneaking
back
to
camp
just
in
case
anyone
should
be
there
this
afternoon
i
came
along
quietly
more
from
force
of
habit
than
from
any
real
idea
of
looking
out
for
intruders
but
along
it
a
sound
pulled
me
up
suddenly
it
was
the
sound
of
a
voice
when
you
have
heard
anyone
speak
for
a
good
many
months
the
human
voice
has
quite
a
startling
effect
upon
you
or
even
the
human
sneeze
miss
norah
added
the
hermit
with
a
twinkle
i
stopped
short
and
listened
with
all
my
might
presently
the
voice
came
again
low
and
guttural
and
i
knew
it
for
a
native
the
conviction
did
fill
me
with
joy
as
you
may
imagine
i
stole
forward
until
by
peeping
through
the
bushes
i
gained
a
view
of
the
camp
and
was
rewarded
with
the
spectacle
of
two
blacks
brutes
they
were
too
quite
at
home
one
in
the
act
of
stuffing
my
cherished
roast
hare
into
a
dirty
bag
the
other
just
taking
a
huge
bite
out
of
my
damper
the
sight
as
you
may
imagine
did
fill
me
with
joy
from
the
bulges
in
my
black
visitors
bag
i
gathered
that
the
ducks
had
preceded
the
hare
and
even
as
i
looked
the
gentleman
with
the
damper
relaxed
his
efforts
and
thrust
it
too
into
the
bag
then
they
put
down
the
bag
and
dived
into
the
tent
and
i
heard
rustlings
and
remarks
that
breathed
satisfaction
i
reckoned
it
was
time
to
step
in
luckily
my
gun
was
outside
the
tent
indeed
i
never
leave
it
inside
but
have
a
special
for
it
under
a
handy
log
for
fear
of
stray
marauders
overhauling
my
possessions
a
gun
is
a
pretty
tempting
thing
to
most
men
and
since
my
failure
i
had
treated
myself
to
a
new
a
beauty
i
crept
to
the
log
drew
out
both
guns
and
then
retired
to
the
bushes
a
little
uncertain
to
tell
the
truth
what
to
do
for
i
any
particular
wish
to
murder
my
dusky
callers
and
at
the
same
time
had
to
remember
that
they
were
two
to
one
and
would
be
unhampered
by
any
feeling
of
chivalry
if
we
did
come
to
blows
i
made
up
my
mind
to
try
to
scare
them
and
suddenly
i
raised
the
most
horrible
terrifying
unearthly
yell
i
could
think
of
and
at
the
same
time
fired
both
barrels
of
one
gun
quickly
in
the
air
the
effect
was
instantaneous
there
was
one
howl
of
horror
and
the
black
fellows
darted
out
of
the
tent
they
almost
cannoned
into
me
and
you
know
i
must
look
a
rum
chap
in
these
furry
clothes
and
cap
with
my
grandfatherly
white
beard
at
all
events
they
seemed
to
think
me
so
for
at
sight
of
me
they
both
yelled
in
terror
and
bolted
away
as
fast
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
i
cheered
the
parting
guests
by
howling
still
more
heartily
and
firing
my
two
remaining
barrels
over
their
heads
as
they
ran
they
went
as
swiftly
as
a
disappears
from
view
i
believe
they
reckoned
they
seen
the
bunyip
i
have
seen
a
trace
of
them
since
they
had
a
fine
time
inside
the
tent
everything
i
possessed
had
been
investigated
and
one
or
two
books
badly
torn
the
wretches
said
the
hermit
ruefully
my
clothes
i
a
few
garments
beside
these
beauties
miss
norah
had
been
pulled
about
my
few
papers
scattered
wildly
and
even
my
bunk
stripped
of
blankets
which
lay
rolled
up
ready
to
be
carried
away
there
was
a
single
one
of
my
poor
possessions
that
had
escaped
notice
except
of
course
my
watch
and
money
which
i
keep
carefully
buried
the
tent
was
a
remarkable
spectacle
and
so
close
and
reminiscent
of
black
fellow
that
my
first
act
was
to
undo
the
sides
and
let
the
fresh
air
play
through
i
counted
myself
very
lucky
to
get
off
as
lightly
as
i
did
had
i
returned
an
hour
later
none
of
my
goods
and
chattels
would
have
been
what
about
the
tucker
harry
asked
did
they
get
away
with
the
bag
they
stowed
it
in
not
they
said
the
hermit
they
were
far
too
scared
to
think
of
bags
or
tucker
they
almost
fell
over
it
in
their
efforts
to
escape
but
neither
of
them
thought
of
picking
it
up
it
was
hard
luck
for
them
after
they
packed
it
so
is
that
how
you
looked
at
it
jim
asked
laughing
well
i
tried
to
said
the
hermit
laughing
in
his
turn
sometimes
it
was
pretty
hard
work
and
i
admit
that
for
the
first
few
days
my
own
misfortunes
were
but
you
did
lose
your
tucker
after
all
you
said
queried
wally
i
thought
they
left
the
bag
they
did
the
hermit
admitted
but
have
you
ever
explored
the
interior
of
a
black
fellow
bag
master
wally
no
well
if
you
had
you
would
understand
that
i
felt
no
further
hankerings
over
those
masterpieces
of
the
cook
art
i
not
extra
particular
i
believe
but
i
could
tackle
them
no
thanks
i
threw
them
into
the
scrub
and
then
washed
my
hands
poor
you
said
norah
oh
i
was
so
badly
off
said
the
hermit
they
left
me
the
which
was
hanging
in
its
billy
from
a
bough
lots
of
duff
i
had
it
morning
noon
and
night
until
i
found
something
fresh
to
cook
and
i
have
made
duff
since
and
here
we
are
at
the
creek
chapter
ix
fishing
the
party
had
for
some
time
been
walking
near
the
creek
so
close
to
it
that
it
was
within
sound
although
they
seldom
got
a
glimpse
of
water
save
where
the
scrub
on
the
bank
grew
thinner
or
the
light
wind
stirred
an
opening
in
its
branches
now
however
the
hermit
suddenly
turned
and
although
the
others
failed
to
perceive
any
track
or
landmark
he
led
them
quickly
through
the
scrub
belt
to
the
bank
of
the
creek
beyond
it
was
indeed
an
ideal
place
for
fishing
a
deep
quiet
pool
partly
shaded
by
big
trees
lay
placid
and
motionless
except
for
an
occasional
ripple
stirred
by
a
light
puff
of
wind
an
old
wattle
tree
grew
on
the
bank
its
limbs
jutting
out
conveniently
and
here
jim
and
wally
ensconced
themselves
immediately
and
turned
their
united
attention
to
business
for
a
time
no
sound
was
heard
save
the
dull
plunk
of
sinkers
as
the
lines
one
by
one
were
flung
into
the
water
the
hermit
did
not
fish
he
had
plenty
at
his
camp
he
said
and
fishing
for
fun
had
lost
its
excitement
since
he
fished
for
a
living
most
days
of
the
week
so
he
contented
himself
with
advising
the
others
where
to
throw
in
and
finally
sat
down
on
the
grass
near
norah
a
few
minutes
passed
then
jim
jerked
his
line
hurriedly
and
began
to
pull
in
with
a
feverish
expression
it
lasted
until
a
big
black
fish
made
its
appearance
dangling
from
the
hook
and
then
it
was
suddenly
succeeded
by
a
look
of
intense
disgust
as
a
final
wriggle
released
the
prisoner
which
fell
back
with
a
splash
into
the
water
well
i
blessed
said
jim
wrathfully
hard
luck
said
harry
try
again
jimmy
and
stick
to
him
this
time
counselled
wally
in
a
fatherly
tone
oh
you
shut
up
jim
answered
his
hook
i
did
catch
an
old
boot
anyhow
which
pertinent
reflection
had
the
effect
of
silencing
wally
amidst
mild
mirth
on
the
part
of
the
other
members
of
the
expedition
scarcely
a
minute
more
and
norah
pulled
sharply
at
her
line
and
began
to
haul
in
rapidly
got
a
whale
inquired
jim
something
like
it
norah
pulled
wildly
hang
on
stick
to
him
mind
your
eye
do
get
your
line
tangled
want
any
help
miss
norah
no
norah
was
almost
breathless
a
red
spot
flamed
in
each
cheek
slowly
the
line
came
in
presently
it
gave
a
sudden
jerk
and
was
tugged
back
quickly
as
the
fish
made
another
run
for
liberty
norah
uttered
an
exclamation
quickly
suppressed
and
caught
it
sharply
pulling
strongly
ah
he
was
out
a
big
handsome
perch
struggling
and
dancing
in
the
air
at
the
end
of
the
line
shouts
broke
from
the
boys
as
norah
landed
her
prize
safely
on
the
bank
well
done
miss
norah
said
the
hermit
warmly
that
a
beauty
as
fine
a
perch
as
i
seen
in
this
oh
is
he
a
splendid
fellow
norah
cried
surveying
the
prey
with
dancing
eyes
i
have
him
for
dad
anyhow
even
if
i
do
catch
yes
dad
breakfast
all
right
laughed
the
hermit
but
worry
you
catch
more
yet
see
there
goes
there
was
a
shout
as
harry
with
a
scientific
flourish
of
his
rod
hauled
a
small
blackfish
from
its
watery
bed
not
bad
for
a
beginning
he
said
grinning
but
not
a
patch
on
yours
norah
oh
i
had
luck
norah
said
he
really
is
a
beauty
is
he
i
think
he
must
be
the
grandfather
of
all
the
if
that
so
said
jim
beginning
to
pull
in
with
an
expression
of
do
or
die
earnestness
i
reckon
i
got
the
grandmother
on
now
a
storm
of
advice
hurtled
about
jim
as
he
tugged
at
his
line
hurry
up
jim
go
slow
there
he
getting
off
again
so
are
you
said
the
ungrateful
recipient
of
the
counsel
puffing
hard
only
a
boot
jim
do
worry
gammon
it
a
shark
look
at
his
worried
expression
i
you
young
harry
grunted
jim
mind
your
eye
there
he
comes
and
expressions
of
admiration
broke
from
the
scoffers
as
a
second
splendid
perch
dangled
in
the
air
and
was
landed
high
and
dry
or
comparatively
so
in
the
branches
of
the
wattle
tree
is
he
as
big
as
yours
norah
queried
jim
a
minute
later
tossing
his
fish
down
on
the
grass
close
to
his
sister
and
the
hermit
norah
laid
the
two
fishes
alongside
not
quite
she
announced
mine
about
an
inch
longer
and
a
bit
well
that
all
right
jim
said
i
said
it
was
the
grandmother
i
had
yours
is
certainly
the
grandfather
i
glad
you
got
the
biggest
old
they
exchanged
a
friendly
smile
a
yell
from
wally
intimated
that
he
had
something
on
his
hook
and
with
immense
pride
he
flourished
in
the
air
a
diminutive
blackfish
so
small
that
the
hermit
proposed
to
use
it
for
bait
a
suggestion
promptly
declined
by
the
captor
who
hid
his
catch
securely
in
the
fork
of
two
branches
before
his
hook
then
harry
pulled
out
a
fine
perch
and
immediately
afterwards
norah
caught
a
blackfish
and
after
that
the
fun
waxed
fast
and
furious
the
fish
biting
splendidly
and
all
hands
being
kept
busy
an
hour
later
harry
shook
the
last
worm
out
of
the
bait
tin
and
dropped
it
into
the
water
on
his
hook
where
it
immediately
was
seized
by
a
perch
of
very
tender
years
get
back
and
grow
till
next
year
advised
harry
detaching
the
little
prisoner
carefully
the
hook
having
caught
lightly
in
the
side
of
its
mouth
i
come
for
you
next
holidays
and
he
tossed
the
tiny
fellow
back
into
the
water
that
our
last
scrap
of
bait
you
chaps
he
said
beginning
to
wind
up
his
line
i
been
fishing
with
an
empty
hook
for
i
do
know
how
long
said
jim
hauling
up
also
these
beggars
have
nibbled
my
bait
off
and
carefully
dodged
the
well
we
plenty
have
we
norah
said
just
look
what
a
splendid
pile
of
fish
they
take
a
bit
of
beating
do
they
said
jim
that
right
wal
pull
him
up
as
wally
hauled
in
another
fine
fish
we
could
carry
more
if
we
had
then
it
a
good
thing
my
bait
gone
too
laughed
norah
winding
up
have
we
had
a
most
lovely
time
jim
produced
a
roll
of
canvas
which
turned
out
to
be
two
sugar
bags
and
in
these
carefully
bestowed
the
fish
sousing
the
whole
thoroughly
in
the
water
the
boys
gathered
up
the
lines
and
tackle
and
planted
the
rods
conveniently
behind
a
log
to
be
ready
for
next
time
they
said
well
we
had
splendid
sport
thanks
to
you
sir
jim
said
turning
to
the
hermit
who
stood
looking
on
at
the
preparations
a
benevolent
person
something
between
father
christmas
and
robinson
crusoe
as
norah
whispered
to
harry
we
certainly
would
have
got
on
half
as
well
if
we
stayed
where
we
oh
i
do
know
the
hermit
answered
yours
is
a
good
place
often
caught
plenty
of
fish
there
only
not
to
be
relied
on
as
this
pool
is
i
really
never
known
this
particular
spot
fail
the
fish
seem
to
live
in
it
all
the
year
round
however
i
glad
you
had
decent
luck
it
not
a
bit
jolly
to
go
home
i
know
and
now
what
the
next
thing
to
be
done
the
afternoon
getting
on
do
you
think
it
time
you
came
to
pay
me
a
visit
at
the
camp
oh
yes
please
norah
cried
jim
hesitated
we
like
awfully
to
see
your
camp
if
if
it
not
any
bother
to
you
he
said
not
the
least
in
the
world
the
hermit
said
only
i
ca
offer
you
any
refreshment
i
nothing
but
cold
and
tea
and
the
an
acquired
taste
i
afraid
i
no
milk
for
the
tea
and
no
damper
either
by
george
said
jim
remorsefully
why
we
ate
all
your
damper
at
lunch
i
can
easily
manufacture
another
the
hermit
said
laughing
used
to
the
process
only
i
do
suppose
i
could
get
it
done
soon
enough
for
afternoon
we
loads
of
tucker
jim
said
far
more
than
we
likely
to
eat
milk
too
we
meant
to
boil
the
billy
again
before
we
start
for
i
tell
you
what
norah
said
struck
by
a
brilliant
idea
for
billy
and
when
he
comes
send
him
back
for
our
things
then
if
if
hermit
likes
we
could
have
tea
at
his
why
that
a
splendid
notion
the
hermit
cried
i
delighted
that
you
thought
of
it
miss
norah
although
i
sorry
my
guests
have
to
supply
their
own
meal
it
does
seem
quite
the
thing
but
in
the
bush
polite
customs
have
to
fall
into
disuse
i
only
keep
up
my
own
good
manners
by
practising
on
old
turpentine
my
snake
however
if
you
so
kind
as
to
overlook
my
deficiencies
and
make
them
up
yourselves
by
all
means
let
us
come
along
and
for
sweet
william
he
shouldered
one
of
the
bags
of
fish
as
he
spoke
disregarding
a
protest
from
the
boys
jim
took
the
second
and
they
set
out
for
the
camp
their
way
led
for
some
time
along
the
track
by
which
they
had
come
if
track
it
might
be
called
certainly
the
hermit
trod
it
confidently
enough
but
the
others
could
only
follow
in
his
wake
and
wonder
by
what
process
he
found
his
way
so
quickly
through
the
thick
bush
about
half
a
mile
along
the
creek
the
hermit
suddenly
turned
off
almost
at
right
angles
and
struck
into
the
scrub
the
children
followed
him
closely
keeping
as
nearly
at
his
heels
as
the
nature
of
the
path
would
permit
norah
found
it
not
very
pleasant
the
hermit
went
at
a
good
rate
swinging
over
the
rough
ground
with
the
case
of
one
accustomed
to
the
scrub
and
familiar
with
the
path
the
boys
unhampered
by
skirts
and
long
hair
found
no
great
difficulty
in
keeping
up
with
him
but
the
small
maiden
of
the
party
handicapped
by
her
clothes
to
say
nothing
of
being
youngest
of
them
all
plodded
along
in
the
rear
catching
on
sarsaparilla
vines
and
raspberry
tangles
plunging
head
first
through
masses
of
dogwood
and
getting
decidedly
the
worst
of
the
journey
harry
was
the
first
to
notice
that
norah
was
falling
into
the
distance
as
he
put
it
and
he
ran
back
to
her
immediately
poor
old
kid
he
said
shamefacedly
i
no
idea
you
were
having
such
a
beast
of
a
time
sorry
norah
his
polite
regrets
were
cut
short
by
norah
catching
her
foot
in
a
creeper
and
falling
bodily
upon
him
thank
you
said
harry
catching
her
deftly
delighted
i
sure
it
a
privilege
to
catch
any
one
like
you
come
on
old
girl
and
i
clear
the
track
for
a
little
farther
on
the
hermit
had
halted
looking
a
trifle
guilty
i
really
sorry
miss
norah
he
said
as
norah
and
harry
made
their
way
up
to
the
waiting
group
i
did
realise
i
was
going
at
such
a
pace
we
make
haste
more
he
led
the
way
pausing
now
and
again
to
make
it
easier
for
the
little
girl
holding
the
bushes
aside
and
lifting
her
bodily
over
several
big
logs
and
sharp
watercourses
finally
he
stopped
i
think
if
you
give
billy
a
call
now
jim
he
said
he
wo
have
much
difficulty
in
finding
to
the
children
it
seemed
an
utter
impossibility
that
billy
should
ever
find
them
though
they
said
nothing
and
jim
obediently
lifted
up
his
voice
and
in
answer
to
the
hermit
words
for
himself
jim
was
free
to
confess
he
had
quite
lost
his
bearings
and
the
other
boys
were
as
much
at
sea
as
if
they
had
suddenly
been
dropped
down
at
the
north
pole
norah
alone
had
an
idea
that
they
were
not
far
from
their
original
an
idea
which
was
confirmed
when
a
long
came
in
response
to
jim
shout
sounding
startlingly
near
at
hand
master
billy
has
been
making
his
way
along
the
creek
commented
the
hermit
he
no
distance
off
give
him
another
here
jim
shouted
billy
answered
again
and
after
a
few
more
exchanges
the
bushes
parted
and
revealed
the
sable
retainer
somewhat
out
of
breath
scoot
back
to
camp
billy
jim
ordered
take
these
fish
and
soak
in
the
creek
and
bring
back
all
our
tucker
milk
and
all
bring
it
where
he
bring
it
sir
to
the
hermit
see
that
tall
tree
broken
with
the
bough
dangling
the
hermit
asked
pointing
some
distance
ahead
billy
nodded
come
back
to
that
and
cooee
and
we
answer
plenty
said
billy
shouldering
the
bags
of
fish
and
departing
at
a
run
billy
had
learnt
early
the
futility
of
wasting
words
come
along
said
the
hermit
laughing
he
turned
off
into
the
scrub
and
led
the
way
again
taking
it
seemed
to
norah
rather
a
roundabout
path
at
length
he
stopped
short
near
a
dense
clump
of
dogwood
my
back
door
he
said
politely
they
stared
about
them
there
was
no
sign
of
any
door
at
all
nor
even
of
any
footprints
or
marks
of
traffic
the
scrub
was
all
about
them
everything
was
very
still
and
quiet
in
the
afternoon
hush
well
you
got
us
beaten
and
no
mistake
jim
laughed
after
they
had
peered
fruitlessly
about
unless
you
camp
in
the
air
i
do
see
look
here
said
the
hermit
he
drew
aside
a
clump
of
dogwood
and
revealed
the
end
of
an
old
log
a
huge
that
had
long
ago
been
a
forest
monarch
but
having
fallen
now
stretched
its
mighty
length
more
than
a
hundred
feet
along
the
ground
it
was
very
broad
and
the
uppermost
side
was
flat
and
here
and
there
bore
traces
of
caked
dry
mud
that
showed
where
a
boot
had
rested
the
dogwood
walled
it
closely
on
each
side
that
my
track
home
the
hermit
said
let
me
help
you
up
miss
he
sprang
up
on
the
log
as
he
spoke
and
extended
a
hand
to
norah
who
followed
him
lightly
then
the
hermit
led
the
way
along
the
log
which
was
quite
broad
enough
to
admit
of
a
wheelbarrow
being
drawn
down
its
length
he
stopped
where
the
butt
of
the
old
tree
rising
above
the
level
of
the
trunk
barred
the
view
and
pulling
aside
the
dogwood
showed
rough
steps
cut
in
the
side
of
the
log
down
here
miss
in
a
moment
they
were
all
on
the
ground
beside
him
wally
disdaining
the
steps
having
sprung
down
and
unexpectedly
measured
his
length
on
the
earth
to
the
accompaniment
of
much
chaff
he
picked
himself
up
laughing
more
than
any
of
them
just
as
norah
popped
her
head
through
the
scrub
that
surrounded
them
and
exclaimed
delightedly
why
here
the
i
say
jim
said
following
the
hermit
into
the
little
clearing
you
well
planted
here
the
space
was
not
very
large
a
roughly
circular
piece
of
ground
ringed
round
with
scrub
in
which
big
gum
trees
reared
their
lofty
heads
a
wattle
tree
stood
in
the
centre
from
its
boughs
dangling
a
rough
hammock
made
of
sacking
while
a
water
bag
hung
from
another
convenient
branch
the
hermit
little
tent
was
pitched
at
one
side
across
the
clearing
was
the
rude
fireplace
that
norah
had
seen
in
the
morning
everything
though
tough
enough
was
very
clean
and
tidy
with
a
certain
attempt
at
comfort
the
hermit
laughed
yes
i
pretty
well
concealed
he
agreed
you
might
be
quite
close
to
the
camp
and
never
dream
that
it
existed
only
bold
explorers
like
miss
norah
would
have
hit
upon
it
from
the
side
where
she
appeared
to
me
this
morning
and
my
big
log
saves
me
the
necessity
of
having
a
beaten
track
home
i
try
by
getting
on
it
at
different
points
to
avoid
a
track
to
the
log
although
should
a
footmark
lead
anyone
to
it
the
intruder
would
never
take
the
trouble
to
walk
down
an
old
bushhung
apparently
for
no
reason
so
that
i
feel
fairly
secure
about
my
home
and
my
belongings
when
i
plan
a
fishing
expedition
or
an
excursion
that
takes
me
any
distance
well
it
a
great
idea
jim
said
of
course
a
beaten
track
to
your
camp
would
be
nothing
more
or
less
than
an
invitation
to
any
swaggie
or
black
fellow
to
follow
it
that
what
i
thought
the
hermit
said
and
very
awkward
it
would
have
been
for
me
seeing
that
one
ca
very
well
put
a
padlock
on
a
tent
and
that
all
my
belongings
are
portable
not
that
there
anything
of
great
value
i
have
a
few
papers
i
would
care
to
lose
a
watch
and
a
little
money
but
they
all
safely
buried
in
a
cashbox
with
a
good
lock
the
rest
i
have
to
chance
and
as
i
told
you
i
so
far
been
pretty
lucky
in
repelling
invaders
there
not
much
traffic
round
here
you
know
jim
and
norah
laughed
not
much
they
said
nodding
my
tent
not
large
the
hermit
said
leading
the
way
to
that
erection
which
was
securely
and
snugly
pitched
with
its
back
door
had
there
been
one
against
the
trunk
of
a
huge
dead
tree
it
was
a
comparatively
new
tent
with
a
good
fly
and
was
watertight
its
owner
explained
in
all
weathers
the
flap
was
elaborately
secured
by
many
strings
tied
with
wonderful
and
fearful
knots
it
must
take
you
a
long
time
to
untie
those
chaps
every
day
said
wally
it
would
said
the
hermit
if
i
did
untie
them
they
only
part
of
my
poor
little
scheme
for
discouraging
intruders
master
he
slipped
his
fingers
inside
the
flap
and
undid
a
hidden
fastening
which
opened
the
tent
without
disarranging
the
array
of
intricate
knots
a
fellow
without
a
knife
might
spend
quite
a
while
in
untying
all
those
said
the
hermit
he
be
rather
disgusted
on
completing
the
job
to
find
they
had
no
bearing
on
the
real
fastening
of
the
tent
and
perhaps
by
that
time
i
might
be
home
the
interior
of
the
tent
was
scrupulously
tidy
and
very
plain
a
hastily
put
up
bunk
was
covered
with
blue
blankets
and
boasted
a
sacking
pillow
from
the
hung
a
candlestick
roughly
fashioned
from
a
knot
of
wood
and
the
furniture
was
completed
by
a
rustic
table
and
chair
made
from
branches
and
showing
considerable
ingenuity
in
their
fashioning
wallaby
skins
thrown
over
the
chair
and
upon
the
floor
lent
a
look
of
comfort
to
the
tiny
dwelling
and
a
further
touch
of
homeliness
was
given
by
many
pictures
cut
from
illustrated
papers
and
fastened
to
the
canvas
walls
the
fly
of
the
tent
projected
some
distance
in
front
and
formed
a
kind
of
verandah
beneath
which
a
second
rustic
seat
stood
as
well
as
a
block
of
wood
that
bore
a
tin
dish
and
evidently
did
duty
as
a
washstand
several
blackened
billies
hung
about
the
camp
with
a
that
bore
marks
of
long
and
honourable
use
the
children
surveyed
this
unusual
home
with
much
curiosity
and
interest
and
the
boys
were
loud
in
their
praises
of
the
chairs
and
tables
the
hermit
listened
to
their
outspoken
comments
with
a
benevolent
look
evidently
pleased
with
their
approval
and
soon
jim
and
he
were
deep
in
a
discussion
of
bush
carpentry
jim
as
wally
said
reckoning
himself
something
of
an
artist
in
that
line
and
being
eager
for
hints
meanwhile
the
other
boys
and
norah
wandered
about
the
camp
wondering
at
the
completeness
that
had
been
arrived
at
with
so
little
material
and
at
its
utter
loneliness
and
isolation
a
man
might
die
here
half
a
dozen
times
and
no
one
be
any
the
wiser
wally
said
i
would
like
it
once
would
be
enough
for
most
harry
grinned
oh
get
out
you
know
what
i
mean
retorted
wally
you
chaps
are
never
satisfied
unless
you
pulling
my
leg
it
a
wonder
i
limp
but
seriously
what
a
jolly
rum
life
for
a
man
to
he
an
educated
chap
too
harry
said
talks
like
a
book
when
he
likes
i
wonder
what
on
earth
he
doing
it
for
they
had
dropped
their
voices
instinctively
and
had
moved
away
from
the
tent
he
certainly
not
the
ordinary
swaggie
norah
said
slowly
not
by
a
good
bit
wally
agreed
why
he
can
talk
like
our
english
master
at
school
perhaps
he
might
be
harry
said
you
never
can
tell
he
certainly
keen
enough
on
getting
away
from
he
chosen
a
good
place
could
be
better
i
wonder
if
there
anything
in
it
if
he
really
has
done
anything
and
does
want
to
be
found
i
never
heard
such
bosh
said
norah
indignantly
one
would
think
he
really
looked
wicked
instead
of
being
such
a
kind
old
chap
think
he
gone
and
committed
a
murder
or
robbed
a
bank
or
something
like
that
i
wonder
you
not
afraid
to
be
in
his
camp
the
boys
stared
in
amazement
whistled
wally
harry
flushed
a
little
oh
steady
norah
he
protested
we
really
did
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
it
was
only
an
idea
i
admit
be
does
look
a
hardened
well
you
should
have
such
ideas
norah
said
stoutly
he
a
great
deal
too
nice
and
look
how
kind
he
been
to
us
if
he
chooses
to
plant
himself
in
the
bush
it
no
one
business
but
his
i
suppose
not
harry
began
he
pulled
up
shortly
as
the
hermit
followed
by
jim
emerged
from
the
tent
the
hermit
had
a
queer
smile
in
his
eyes
but
jim
looked
desperately
uncomfortable
jim
favoured
the
others
with
a
heavy
scowl
as
he
came
out
of
the
tent
slipping
behind
the
hermit
in
order
that
he
might
deliver
it
unobserved
it
was
plain
enough
to
fill
them
with
considerable
discomfort
they
exchanged
glances
of
bewilderment
i
wonder
what
up
now
wally
whispered
jim
strolled
over
to
them
as
the
hermit
without
saying
anything
crossed
to
his
fireplace
and
began
to
put
some
sticks
together
you
bright
objects
he
whispered
wrathfully
why
ca
you
speak
softly
if
you
must
go
gabbling
about
other
people
you
do
mean
to
say
he
heard
us
harry
said
colouring
i
do
then
we
could
hear
every
word
you
said
and
it
was
jolly
awkward
for
me
i
did
know
which
way
to
was
he
wild
whispered
wally
blessed
if
i
know
he
just
laughed
in
a
queer
way
until
norah
stuck
up
for
him
and
then
he
looked
grave
lucky
to
have
one
friend
he
said
and
walked
out
of
the
tent
you
a
set
of
goats
finished
jim
comprehensively
well
i
not
ashamed
of
what
i
said
anyhow
norah
answered
indignantly
she
elevated
her
nose
and
walked
away
to
where
the
hermit
was
gathering
sticks
into
which
occupation
she
promptly
entered
the
boys
looked
at
each
other
well
i
am
rather
harry
said
he
disappeared
into
the
scrub
returning
presently
with
a
log
of
wood
as
heavy
as
he
could
drag
wally
seeing
his
idea
speedily
followed
suit
and
jim
after
a
stare
copied
their
example
they
worked
so
hard
that
by
the
time
the
hermit
and
norah
had
the
fire
alight
quite
a
respectable
stack
of
wood
greeted
the
eye
of
the
master
of
the
camp
he
looked
genuinely
pleased
well
you
are
kind
chaps
he
said
that
will
save
me
for
many
a
day
and
it
is
a
job
that
bothers
my
old
we
very
glad
to
get
it
for
you
sir
jim
blurted
a
trifle
shamefacedly
a
twinkle
came
into
the
hermit
eyes
as
he
looked
at
him
that
all
square
jim
he
said
quietly
and
without
any
more
being
said
the
boys
felt
relieved
evidently
this
hermit
was
not
a
man
to
bear
malice
even
if
he
did
overhear
talk
that
was
meant
for
him
well
said
the
hermit
breaking
a
somewhat
awkward
silence
about
time
we
heard
the
dusky
billy
is
it
quite
time
i
reckon
jim
replied
lazy
young
beggar
well
the
billy
not
boiling
yet
although
it
not
far
off
there
he
is
norah
said
quickly
as
a
long
shout
sounded
near
at
hand
the
hermit
quickly
went
off
in
its
direction
and
presently
returned
followed
by
billy
whose
eyes
were
round
as
he
glanced
about
the
strange
place
in
which
he
found
himself
although
otherwise
no
sign
of
surprise
appeared
on
his
sable
countenance
he
carried
the
bags
containing
the
picnic
expedition
supply
of
food
which
norah
promptly
fell
to
unpacking
an
ample
supply
remained
from
lunch
and
when
displayed
to
advantage
on
the
short
grass
of
the
clearing
the
meal
looked
very
tempting
the
hermit
eyes
glistened
as
norah
unpacked
a
bag
of
apples
and
oranges
as
a
finishing
touch
fruit
he
said
oh
you
lucky
people
i
wish
there
were
fruit
shops
in
the
scrub
i
can
dispense
with
all
the
others
but
one
does
miss
well
i
glad
we
brought
such
a
bagful
because
i
sure
we
do
want
it
norah
said
you
must
let
us
leave
it
with
you
water
plenty
boilin
said
billy
tea
was
quickly
brewed
and
presently
they
were
seated
on
the
ground
and
making
a
hearty
meal
as
if
the
lunch
of
a
few
hours
ago
had
never
been
if
a
fellow
ca
get
hungry
in
the
bush
said
wally
holding
out
his
hand
for
his
fifth
scone
then
he
does
deserve
ever
to
get
hungry
at
all
to
which
jim
replied
do
worry
old
man
that
a
fate
never
likely
to
overtake
you
wally
whose
hunger
was
of
a
generally
prevailing
kind
which
usually
afflicted
him
most
in
school
hours
subsided
meekly
into
his
they
did
not
hurry
over
the
meal
for
everyone
was
a
little
lazy
after
the
long
day
and
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
get
home
the
long
summer
evening
was
before
them
and
it
would
merge
into
the
beauty
of
a
moonlit
night
so
they
loafed
and
chatted
aimlessly
and
drank
huge
quantities
of
the
that
is
quite
the
nicest
tea
in
the
world
especially
when
it
is
stirred
with
a
stick
and
when
they
were
really
ashamed
to
eat
any
more
they
lay
about
on
the
grass
yarning
telling
bush
tales
many
and
strange
and
listening
while
the
hermit
spun
them
stories
that
made
the
time
slip
away
wonderfully
it
was
with
a
sigh
that
jim
roused
himself
at
last
well
he
said
it
awfully
nice
being
here
and
i
not
in
a
bit
of
a
hurry
to
go
are
you
chaps
the
chaps
chorused
all
the
same
it
getting
late
jim
went
on
pulling
out
his
watch
later
than
i
thought
my
word
come
on
we
have
to
hurry
billy
you
slip
along
and
saddle
up
the
ponies
quick
billy
departed
noiselessly
he
never
said
said
wally
disappointedly
gathering
himself
up
from
the
grass
it
was
an
oversight
jim
laughed
now
then
norah
come
along
what
about
the
miserable
remains
the
remains
are
so
miserable
said
norah
who
was
on
her
knees
gathering
up
the
fragments
of
the
feast
see
there
a
lot
of
bread
yet
ever
so
many
scones
heaps
of
cake
and
the
fruit
to
say
nothing
of
butter
and
she
looked
up
shyly
at
the
hermit
would
you
would
you
mind
having
them
the
hermit
laughed
not
a
bit
he
said
i
not
proud
and
it
is
really
a
treat
to
see
civilized
food
again
i
willingly
act
as
your
scavenger
miss
together
they
packed
up
the
remnants
and
the
hermit
deposited
them
inside
his
tent
he
rummaged
for
a
minute
in
a
bag
near
his
bed
and
presently
came
out
with
something
in
his
hand
i
amuse
myself
in
my
many
odd
moments
by
this
sort
of
thing
he
said
will
you
have
it
miss
norah
he
put
a
photograph
frame
into
her
hand
a
dainty
thing
made
from
the
native
woods
cunningly
jointed
together
and
beautifully
carved
norah
accepted
it
with
pleasure
it
not
anything
the
hermit
disclaimed
very
rough
i
afraid
but
you
ca
do
very
good
work
when
your
is
your
only
tool
i
hope
you
forgive
its
shortcomings
miss
norah
and
keep
it
to
remember
the
old
i
think
it
lovely
norah
said
looking
up
with
shining
eyes
and
i
ever
so
much
obliged
i
always
keep
do
forget
the
hermit
said
looking
down
at
the
flushed
face
and
some
day
perhaps
you
all
come
we
must
hurry
jim
said
they
were
all
back
at
the
and
the
sight
of
the
sun
sinking
far
across
the
plain
recalled
jim
to
a
sense
of
responsibility
it
every
man
for
his
own
steed
he
said
can
you
manage
your
old
crock
norah
do
you
wish
yours
was
half
as
good
queried
norah
as
she
took
the
halter
off
bobs
and
slipped
the
bit
into
his
mouth
jim
grinned
knew
i
got
her
on
a
soft
spot
he
murmured
wrestling
with
a
refractory
crupper
harry
and
wally
were
already
at
their
ponies
billy
having
fixed
the
load
to
his
satisfaction
on
the
pack
mare
was
standing
on
one
foot
on
a
log
jutting
over
the
creek
drawing
the
fish
from
their
cool
in
the
water
the
bag
came
up
heavy
and
dripping
so
heavy
indeed
that
it
proved
the
last
straw
for
billy
balance
and
after
a
wild
struggle
to
remain
on
the
log
he
was
forced
to
step
off
with
great
decision
into
the
water
a
movement
accompanied
with
a
decisive
bust
amidst
wild
mirth
on
the
part
of
the
boys
luckily
the
water
was
not
knee
deep
and
the
black
retainer
regained
the
log
not
much
the
worse
except
in
temper
damp
in
there
billy
queried
wally
with
a
grave
face
plenty
growled
billy
marching
off
the
log
with
offended
dignity
and
a
dripping
leg
the
hermit
had
taken
norah
saddle
and
placed
it
on
bobs
girthing
it
up
with
the
quick
movements
of
a
practised
hand
norah
watched
him
keenly
and
satisfaction
crept
into
her
eyes
as
the
job
done
the
old
man
stroked
the
pony
glossy
neck
and
bobs
scenting
a
friend
put
his
nose
into
his
hand
he
likes
you
norah
said
he
does
do
that
to
everyone
do
you
like
horses
better
than
men
said
the
hermit
you
a
good
pony
miss
yes
he
a
beauty
the
little
girl
said
i
had
him
since
he
was
a
he
carry
you
home
well
fifteen
miles
is
it
about
that
i
and
we
find
dad
hanging
over
the
home
paddock
gate
wondering
where
we
are
said
jim
coming
up
leading
his
pony
we
have
to
say
and
said
the
hermit
holding
out
his
hand
sorry
you
all
got
to
go
perhaps
some
other
holidays
we
come
out
nodded
jim
he
shook
hands
warmly
and
if
ever
you
find
your
way
in
as
far
as
our
place
i
afraid
not
said
the
hermit
hastily
as
i
was
explaining
to
miss
norah
i
a
solitary
animal
but
i
hope
to
see
you
all
the
boys
said
and
mounted
the
hermit
held
bobs
while
norah
swung
herself
up
the
pony
was
impatient
to
be
gone
he
said
norah
looked
at
him
pitifully
i
wo
say
she
said
i
coming
back
some
day
so
it
long
so
long
the
old
man
echoed
rather
drearily
holding
her
hand
then
something
queer
came
into
his
eyes
for
suddenly
norah
bent
from
the
saddle
and
kissed
his
cheek
he
stood
long
watching
the
ponies
and
the
little
young
figures
scurrying
across
the
plain
when
they
vanished
he
turned
wearily
and
with
slow
steps
went
back
into
the
scrub
they
forded
the
creek
carefully
for
the
water
was
high
and
it
was
dark
in
the
shadows
of
the
trees
on
the
banks
jim
knew
the
way
well
and
so
did
norah
and
they
led
followed
by
the
other
boys
when
they
had
crossed
it
was
necessary
to
go
steadily
in
the
dim
light
the
track
was
only
wide
enough
for
them
to
ride
in
indian
file
which
is
not
a
method
of
locomotion
which
assists
conversation
and
they
rode
almost
in
silence
it
was
queer
down
there
in
the
bush
with
only
cries
of
birds
to
break
the
quiet
owls
and
mopokes
hooted
dismally
and
once
a
great
flapping
thing
flew
into
harry
face
and
he
uttered
a
startled
yell
before
he
realised
that
it
was
only
one
of
the
night
birds
whereat
mirth
ensued
at
the
expense
of
harry
then
to
scare
away
the
hooters
they
put
silence
to
flight
with
choruses
and
the
old
bush
echoed
to
way
down
upon
the
swanee
river
and
more
modern
songs
which
half
so
sweet
as
the
old
christy
minstrel
ditties
after
they
had
exhausted
all
the
choruses
they
knew
harry
obliged
with
one
of
gordon
poems
recited
with
such
boyish
simplicity
combined
with
vigour
that
it
quite
brought
down
the
audience
who
applauded
so
loudly
that
the
orator
was
thankful
for
the
darkness
to
conceal
his
blushes
old
harry
our
champion
elocutioner
at
school
you
know
wally
said
you
should
have
heard
him
last
speech
day
he
got
more
clapping
than
all
the
rest
put
shut
up
young
wally
growled
harry
in
tones
of
affected
wrath
same
to
you
said
wally
cheerfully
why
you
had
all
the
mammas
howling
into
their
hankies
in
your
encore
piece
after
which
nothing
would
satisfy
norah
but
another
recitation
and
another
after
that
and
then
the
timber
ended
and
there
was
only
the
level
plain
be
tween
them
and
home
with
the
moon
just
high
enough
to
make
it
sufficiently
light
for
a
gallop
they
tore
wildly
homeward
and
landed
in
a
slightly
dishevelled
bunch
at
the
gate
of
the
paddock
no
one
was
about
the
stables
men
all
gone
off
somewhere
said
jim
laconically
proceeding
to
let
his
pony
go
his
example
was
followed
by
each
of
the
others
the
steeds
dismissed
with
a
rub
and
a
pat
and
the
saddles
placed
on
the
stands
well
i
do
know
about
you
chaps
said
jim
but
i
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
same
here
chorused
the
chaps
come
along
and
see
what
good
old
brownie
put
by
for
us
said
norah
disappearing
towards
the
house
like
a
small
comet
the
boys
raced
after
her
in
the
kitchen
doorway
brown
stood
her
broad
face
resplendent
with
smiles
i
was
just
beginning
to
wonder
if
any
of
you
had
fallen
into
the
creek
she
said
you
must
be
hungry
poor
dears
supper
where
dad
asked
norah
your
pa
gone
to
sydney
yes
my
dears
a
tallygrum
came
for
him
something
about
some
valuable
cattle
to
be
sold
as
he
oh
said
jim
those
shorthorns
he
was
talking
about
very
like
master
jim
very
sorry
your
pa
were
he
said
to
go
so
suddint
and
not
to
see
you
again
and
the
other
young
gentlemen
likewise
seein
you
go
away
on
monday
he
left
his
love
to
miss
norah
and
a
letter
for
you
and
miss
norah
you
was
to
try
not
to
be
dull
and
he
would
be
back
by
thursday
so
he
oh
said
norah
blankly
it
hardly
a
homecoming
without
supper
was
over
at
last
and
it
had
been
a
monumental
meal
to
behold
the
onslaughts
made
by
the
four
upon
brown
extensive
preparations
one
might
have
supposed
that
they
had
previously
been
starving
for
time
uncounted
heigho
said
jim
our
last
day
groans
followed
from
harry
and
wally
what
do
you
want
to
remind
a
fellow
for
could
help
it
slipped
out
what
a
jolly
sell
not
to
see
old
dad
again
jim
wrinkled
his
brown
handsome
face
into
a
frown
you
need
talk
said
norah
gloomily
fancy
me
on
monday
not
a
soul
to
speak
poor
old
norah
yes
it
rough
on
you
said
jim
wish
you
were
coming
too
why
ca
you
get
dad
to
let
you
go
to
school
in
melbourne
thanks
said
norah
hastily
i
rather
not
i
think
i
can
bear
this
better
school
what
on
earth
would
i
do
with
myself
shut
up
all
day
oh
all
right
i
thought
you
might
like
it
you
get
used
to
it
you
i
could
get
used
to
doing
without
dad
returned
norah
or
dad
to
doing
without
you
i
reckon
said
jim
oh
i
suppose
better
as
it
is
only
you
have
to
get
taught
some
day
old
chap
i
oh
never
mind
that
now
norah
said
impatiently
i
suppose
i
have
a
governess
some
day
and
she
wo
let
me
ride
astride
or
go
after
the
cattle
or
climb
trees
or
do
anything
worth
doing
and
everything
will
be
perfectly
hateful
it
simply
beastly
to
be
getting
old
cheer
up
old
party
jim
laughed
she
might
be
quite
a
decent
sort
for
all
you
know
as
for
riding
astride
dad
never
let
you
ride
any
other
way
so
you
can
keep
your
mind
easy
about
that
well
never
mind
governesses
anyhow
you
have
got
one
yet
and
sufficient
unto
the
day
is
the
governess
thereof
what
are
we
going
to
do
ca
do
very
much
said
norah
still
showing
traces
of
gloom
sunday
besides
the
horses
want
a
spell
and
you
boys
will
have
to
pack
you
leave
pretty
early
on
monday
you
oh
botheration
said
wally
jumping
up
so
suddenly
that
he
upset
his
chair
for
goodness
sake
do
talk
of
going
back
until
we
actually
get
there
it
bad
enough
then
let
go
and
explore
somewhere
we
can
do
that
all
right
said
jim
glad
of
any
turn
being
given
to
the
melancholy
conversation
we
never
taken
you
chaps
to
the
falls
two
miles
up
the
creek
and
they
worth
it
a
nice
walk
too
added
norah
putting
sorrow
to
flight
by
deftly
landing
a
pellet
of
bread
on
harry
nose
think
you
can
struggle
so
far
harry
yes
and
carry
you
back
when
you
knock
up
said
that
gentleman
returning
the
missile
without
success
norah
having
retreated
behind
a
vase
of
roses
i
think
it
would
be
a
jolly
good
right
oh
said
jim
that
settled
we
pack
up
in
the
morning
get
brownie
to
give
us
dinner
early
and
start
in
good
time
it
really
take
long
to
walk
there
you
know
only
we
want
to
be
able
to
loaf
on
the
way
and
when
we
get
to
the
rather
said
harry
i
never
see
any
fun
in
a
walk
when
you
tear
somewhere
get
there
and
tear
back
again
life
too
short
come
on
norah
and
play
to
so
they
trooped
into
the
and
for
an
hour
the
boys
lay
about
on
sofas
and
easy
chairs
while
norah
played
softly
finally
she
found
that
her
entire
audience
was
sound
asleep
a
state
of
things
she
very
naturally
resented
by
gently
pouring
water
from
a
vase
on
their
peaceful
faces
peace
fled
at
that
and
so
did
norah
chapter
x
the
last
day
now
then
harry
are
you
ready
coming
said
harry
cheerful
voice
he
appeared
on
the
verandah
endeavouring
to
cram
a
gigantic
apple
into
his
pocket
norah
he
said
in
response
to
jim
lifted
eyebrows
do
know
if
she
means
to
eat
it
in
sections
or
not
it
certainly
does
mean
to
go
into
my
pocket
as
it
he
desisted
from
his
efforts
try
it
in
the
crown
of
your
hat
old
thanks
my
hat
got
all
it
knows
to
hold
my
brains
retorted
jim
you
ca
take
that
thing
here
norah
as
that
damsel
appeared
on
the
step
how
do
you
imagine
harry
going
to
cart
this
apple
quite
simple
said
norah
airily
cut
it
in
four
and
we
each
take
a
that
the
judgment
of
solomon
said
wally
who
was
lying
full
length
on
the
lawn
recovering
as
jim
unkindly
suggested
from
dinner
well
come
along
jim
said
impatiently
you
an
awfully
hard
crowd
to
get
started
we
want
to
reach
the
falls
in
fair
time
to
see
the
sunlight
on
them
it
awfully
pretty
after
about
three
or
four
the
trees
shade
the
water
and
it
quite
just
plain
wet
water
murmured
wally
jim
rolled
him
over
and
over
down
the
sloping
lawn
and
then
fled
pursued
by
wally
with
dishevelled
attire
and
much
grass
in
his
mouth
the
others
followed
more
steadily
and
all
four
struck
across
the
paddock
to
the
creek
it
was
a
rather
hot
afternoon
and
they
were
glad
to
reach
the
shade
of
the
bank
and
to
follow
the
cattle
track
that
led
close
to
the
water
great
fat
bullocks
lay
about
under
the
huge
gum
trees
scarcely
raising
their
eyes
to
glance
at
the
children
as
they
passed
none
were
eating
all
were
chewing
the
cud
in
lazy
contentment
they
passed
through
a
smaller
paddock
where
superb
sheep
dotted
the
grass
real
aristocrats
these
accustomed
to
be
handled
and
petted
and
to
live
on
the
fat
of
the
land
poor
grass
or
rough
country
food
they
had
never
known
jim
and
norah
visited
some
special
favourites
and
patted
them
harry
and
wally
admired
at
a
distance
those
some
of
the
sheep
you
saved
from
the
fire
queried
harry
norah
flushed
never
did
she
said
shortly
and
untruthfully
do
know
why
you
ca
talk
sense
jim
at
which
that
maligned
youth
laughed
excessively
until
first
the
other
boys
and
then
norah
joined
in
perforce
after
again
climbing
over
the
fence
of
the
smaller
paddock
they
came
out
upon
a
wide
plain
almost
treeless
save
for
the
timber
along
the
creek
where
their
cattle
track
still
led
them
far
as
they
could
see
no
fence
broke
the
line
of
yellow
grass
there
were
groups
of
cattle
out
on
the
plain
these
were
store
bullocks
jim
explained
a
draft
recently
arrived
from
queensland
and
hardly
yet
acclimatised
it
takes
a
good
while
for
them
to
settle
down
norah
said
and
then
lots
of
get
sick
pleuro
and
things
and
we
inoculate
them
and
their
tails
drop
off
and
sometimes
the
sick
ones
get
and
it
quite
exciting
work
dangerous
asked
wally
not
with
a
pony
that
knows
things
like
bobs
said
bobs
mistress
he
always
keeps
his
weather
eye
open
for
not
a
bad
thing
as
you
certainly
do
laughed
jim
well
do
you
certainly
i
do
said
jim
firmly
whereat
norah
laughed
very
heartily
when
i
leave
school
dad
says
i
can
go
on
the
roads
with
the
cattle
for
one
trip
said
jim
be
no
end
of
fun
takes
ever
so
long
to
bring
them
down
from
queensland
and
the
men
have
a
real
good
time
travel
with
a
cook
and
a
covered
buggy
and
pair
to
bring
the
tucker
and
tents
what
you
be
asked
wally
cook
no
slushy
said
harry
no
i
take
you
two
chaps
along
in
those
billets
grinned
jim
i
do
know
who
be
cook
said
norah
solemnly
but
i
do
think
the
men
would
be
in
very
good
condition
at
the
end
of
the
trip
whichever
of
you
it
was
with
such
pleasantries
they
beguiled
the
way
until
on
rounding
a
bend
in
the
track
a
dull
roar
came
plainly
to
their
ears
what
that
asked
wally
stopping
to
listen
that
the
falls
my
boy
replied
jim
they
really
quite
respectable
falls
almost
niagarous
come
along
we
see
them
in
a
couple
of
the
sound
of
falling
water
became
plainer
and
plainer
as
they
pushed
on
at
this
point
the
track
was
less
defined
and
the
scrub
thicker
jim
explained
that
the
cattle
did
not
come
here
much
as
there
was
no
for
them
for
a
good
distance
below
the
falls
they
might
almost
have
imagined
themselves
back
in
the
bush
near
the
hermit
camp
harry
said
as
they
pushed
their
way
through
scrub
and
undergrowth
many
raspberry
vines
adding
variety
if
not
charm
to
the
scramble
the
last
part
of
the
walk
was
up
bill
and
at
length
they
came
out
upon
a
clearer
patch
of
ground
for
some
time
the
noise
of
the
falls
had
deepened
until
now
it
was
a
loud
roar
but
the
sound
had
hardly
prepared
the
boys
for
the
sight
that
met
their
gaze
high
up
were
rocky
cliffs
sparsely
clothed
with
vegetation
and
through
these
the
creek
had
cut
its
way
falling
in
one
sheer
mass
fifty
feet
or
more
into
the
bed
below
hollowed
out
by
it
during
countless
ages
the
water
curved
over
the
top
of
the
fall
in
one
exquisite
wave
smooth
as
polished
marble
but
down
a
point
of
rock
jutted
suddenly
out
and
on
this
the
waters
dashed
and
split
flying
off
from
it
in
a
cloud
of
spray
at
the
foot
the
cataract
roared
and
bubbled
and
seethed
in
one
boiling
mass
of
rapids
but
the
glory
of
it
all
was
the
sunlight
it
fell
right
on
the
mass
of
descending
water
and
in
the
rays
the
fall
glittered
and
flashed
with
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
and
the
flying
spray
was
like
powdered
jewels
it
caught
the
drops
hanging
on
the
ferns
that
fringed
the
water
and
turned
them
into
twinkling
diamonds
the
whole
fall
seemed
to
be
alive
in
the
sunbeams
dancing
light
i
say
whispered
harry
fancy
never
showing
us
this
before
he
cast
himself
on
the
ground
and
lay
chin
in
hands
gazing
at
the
wonder
before
him
we
kept
it
to
the
last
said
norah
softly
she
sat
down
by
him
and
the
others
followed
their
example
just
think
said
harry
that
old
creek
been
doing
that
ever
since
time
began
every
day
the
sun
comes
to
take
his
share
at
lighting
it
up
long
before
we
were
born
and
ages
after
we
shall
die
does
it
make
you
feel
small
norah
nodded
understandingly
i
saw
it
once
by
moonlight
she
said
dad
and
i
rode
here
one
night
full
moon
oh
it
was
lovely
not
like
this
of
course
because
there
was
any
colour
but
a
beautiful
white
clean
light
and
the
fall
was
like
a
sheet
of
did
you
ever
throw
anything
over
asked
wally
his
wonderment
was
subsiding
and
the
boy
in
him
woke
up
again
no
good
said
jim
you
never
see
it
again
i
thrown
a
stick
in
up
above
and
it
simply
whisks
over
and
gets
sucked
underneath
the
curtain
of
water
at
once
and
disappears
altogether
until
it
reaches
the
smooth
water
ever
so
far
say
you
went
over
yourself
would
be
much
left
of
you
jim
answered
with
a
laugh
the
bed
of
the
creek
simply
full
of
rocks
you
can
see
a
spike
sticking
up
here
and
there
in
the
rapids
we
seen
sheep
come
down
in
they
get
battered
to
bits
i
do
think
i
try
any
experiments
thank
you
young
you
always
were
a
disobliging
critter
wally
grinned
another
time
a
canoe
came
over
jim
said
it
belonged
to
two
chaps
farther
up
they
just
built
it
and
were
out
for
the
first
time
and
got
down
too
near
the
falls
they
did
know
much
about
managing
their
craft
and
when
the
suck
of
the
water
began
to
take
them
along
they
could
get
out
of
the
current
they
went
faster
and
faster
struggling
to
paddle
against
the
stream
instead
of
getting
out
at
an
angle
and
making
for
the
bank
which
they
might
have
done
at
last
they
could
hear
the
roar
of
the
falls
quite
what
happened
to
them
asked
wally
did
they
go
over
well
they
reckoned
it
was
healthy
to
remain
in
the
canoe
said
jim
it
was
simply
spinning
along
in
the
current
and
the
falls
were
almost
in
sight
so
they
dived
in
on
opposite
sides
the
blessed
canoe
nearly
tipped
over
when
they
stood
up
and
only
the
shock
of
the
cross
drive
kept
her
right
of
course
the
creek
not
so
very
wide
even
farther
up
beyond
the
falls
and
the
force
of
their
spring
sent
them
nearly
out
of
the
current
they
could
both
swim
well
and
after
a
struggle
they
got
to
the
banks
just
in
time
to
see
the
canoe
whisk
over
the
waterfall
what
hard
luck
it
was
rather
they
started
off
to
find
it
but
for
a
long
way
they
could
see
a
trace
then
right
in
the
calm
water
ever
so
far
down
they
found
it
bit
by
bit
it
was
broken
into
so
much
matchwood
what
did
they
do
asked
wally
stood
and
stared
at
it
from
opposite
sides
like
two
wet
images
said
jim
laughing
it
lowdown
to
grin
i
suppose
but
they
must
have
looked
funny
then
one
of
them
swam
across
and
they
made
their
way
to
our
place
and
we
fixed
them
up
with
dry
things
and
drove
them
home
i
do
think
they
gone
in
for
canoeing
since
finished
jim
reflectively
well
i
guess
it
would
discourage
them
a
bit
wally
agreed
getting
shipwrecked
no
ever
tried
it
once
in
albert
park
lagoon
wally
admitted
bashfully
some
of
us
went
out
for
a
sail
one
saturday
afternoon
we
did
know
much
about
it
and
i
really
do
know
what
it
was
that
tipped
the
old
boat
over
i
was
the
smallest
so
naturally
i
was
having
any
say
in
managing
that
accounts
for
it
said
jim
dryly
did
mean
that
goat
said
wally
anyhow
i
was
very
much
astonished
to
find
myself
suddenly
kicking
in
the
mud
ever
been
in
that
lake
it
is
nice
it
is
deep
enough
to
drown
you
but
the
mud
is
a
caution
i
got
it
all
over
me
face
and
all
you
must
have
looked
your
best
said
jim
i
did
i
managed
to
stand
up
very
much
amazed
to
find
i
drowned
two
of
the
others
walked
out
i
was
too
small
to
do
more
than
just
manage
to
keep
upright
the
water
was
round
my
chest
i
have
walked
a
how
did
you
manage
a
boat
came
along
and
picked
up
the
survivors
grinned
wally
they
would
take
us
in
we
were
just
caked
with
mud
so
i
do
blame
but
we
hung
on
to
the
stern
and
they
towed
us
to
the
shore
we
were
quite
close
to
land
then
they
went
back
and
brought
our
boat
to
us
they
were
jolly
kind
chaps
did
seem
to
mind
any
you
do
seem
to
have
minded
it
either
said
norah
we
were
too
busy
laughing
wally
said
you
have
to
expect
these
things
when
you
go
in
for
a
life
on
the
ocean
wave
the
worst
part
of
it
came
afterwards
when
we
went
home
that
was
really
unpleasant
i
was
staying
at
my
aunt
in
did
you
get
into
a
row
it
was
unpleasant
wally
repeated
aunts
have
much
sympathy
you
know
they
do
like
mess
and
i
was
no
end
messy
we
wo
talk
about
it
i
think
thank
wally
rolled
over
on
his
back
produced
an
apple
and
bit
into
it
solemnly
let
us
respect
his
silence
said
jim
you
had
aunts
too
queried
wally
with
his
mouth
full
not
exactly
aunts
jim
said
but
we
had
an
old
tartar
of
a
housekeeper
once
when
we
were
small
kids
she
ruled
us
with
a
rod
of
iron
for
about
six
months
and
norah
and
i
could
hardly
call
our
souls
our
own
father
used
to
be
a
good
deal
away
and
lister
could
do
pretty
well
as
she
i
did
abominate
that
woman
said
norah
reflectively
i
do
wonder
replied
jim
you
certainly
were
a
downtrodden
little
nipper
as
ever
was
remember
the
time
we
went
canoeing
in
the
flood
on
your
old
not
likely
to
forget
what
was
it
wally
asked
tell
us
norah
had
a
pram
like
most
kids
jim
began
well
i
like
that
said
norah
in
great
indignation
it
was
yours
first
never
said
it
was
said
jim
somewhat
abashed
by
the
laughter
that
ensued
but
that
was
ages
ago
it
was
yours
at
this
time
anyhow
but
only
the
lower
storey
was
left
just
the
floor
of
the
pram
on
three
wheels
norah
used
to
sit
on
this
thing
and
push
herself
along
with
two
sticks
like
rowing
on
dry
it
was
no
end
of
fun
said
norah
you
go
you
could
grinned
jim
i
never
forget
the
day
i
saw
you
start
from
the
top
of
the
hill
near
the
house
the
pram
got
a
rate
on
of
a
mile
a
minute
and
the
sticks
were
needed
about
down
it
struck
a
root
and
turned
three
double
somersaults
in
the
air
i
know
how
many
norah
turned
but
when
dad
and
i
got
to
the
spot
she
was
sitting
on
a
thick
mat
of
grass
laughing
like
one
and
the
pram
was
about
half
a
mile
away
on
the
flat
with
its
wheels
in
the
air
we
quite
reckoned
you
were
yes
and
dad
made
me
promise
not
to
go
down
that
hill
again
said
norah
ruefully
it
was
a
horrid
nuisance
well
there
was
a
flood
said
jim
not
very
much
of
a
one
we
had
a
good
bit
of
rain
and
the
in
the
home
paddock
overflowed
and
covered
all
the
flat
about
two
feet
deep
at
first
it
was
a
bit
too
deep
for
norah
and
her
wheeled
boat
but
when
it
went
down
a
bit
she
set
off
voyaging
she
did
look
a
rum
little
figure
out
in
the
middle
of
the
water
pushing
herself
along
with
her
two
sticks
lister
approve
of
it
but
as
dad
had
given
her
leave
the
housekeeper
stop
at
this
point
norah
was
heard
to
murmur
cat
just
so
said
jim
well
you
know
i
used
to
poke
fun
at
norah
and
this
thing
but
one
day
i
had
gone
down
to
the
water
edge
and
she
came
up
on
it
poling
herself
through
the
water
at
a
great
rate
and
it
occurred
to
me
it
did
look
half
bad
fun
so
i
suggested
a
turn
you
said
kid
let
have
that
thing
for
a
bit
said
norah
firmly
did
i
said
jim
with
meekness
yes
you
did
so
i
kindly
got
then
asked
harry
he
got
on
i
said
dear
pray
be
careful
about
the
holes
and
let
me
tell
you
where
they
are
i
sure
you
did
grinned
wally
and
he
said
a
kid
like
you
can
keep
out
of
holes
i
guess
i
can
i
sure
he
did
said
wally
yes
so
he
set
off
now
i
had
been
over
that
flat
so
often
in
dry
weather
that
i
knew
every
bit
of
it
but
jim
did
he
went
off
as
hard
as
he
could
and
got
on
very
well
for
a
little
bit
am
i
telling
this
yarn
or
are
you
inquired
jim
laughing
this
is
the
part
that
is
best
for
me
to
tell
said
norah
solemnly
then
he
turned
suddenly
so
suddenly
i
had
time
to
do
more
than
yell
a
warning
which
he
did
hear
and
the
next
minute
the
side
wheels
of
the
pram
went
over
the
edge
of
a
hole
and
the
thing
turned
upside
down
upon
poor
old
jimmy
how
lovely
said
wally
kicking
with
delight
well
and
what
happened
oh
jim
can
tell
you
now
laughed
norah
i
was
under
the
water
i
was
said
jim
the
blessed
old
pram
turned
clean
over
and
cast
me
bodily
into
a
hole
that
was
all
i
knew
until
i
tried
to
get
out
and
found
the
pram
had
come
too
and
was
right
on
top
of
me
and
do
you
think
i
could
move
that
blessed
thing
well
in
came
norah
said
jim
i
take
it
out
of
you
now
my
girl
she
realised
at
once
what
had
happened
and
waded
in
from
the
bank
and
pulled
the
old
pram
off
her
poor
little
brother
i
came
up
spluttering
to
see
norah
looking
very
white
just
preparing
to
dive
in
after
me
you
never
saw
such
a
drowned
rat
said
norah
taking
up
the
tale
soaked
and
muddy
and
very
cross
and
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
abuse
my
poor
old
well
would
you
jim
laughed
had
to
abuse
something
anyhow
we
righted
her
and
norah
waded
farther
in
after
the
sticks
which
had
floated
peacefully
away
and
we
pulled
the
ashore
then
we
roared
laughing
at
each
other
i
certainly
was
a
drowned
rat
but
norah
was
much
better
as
she
slipped
nearly
into
the
hole
herself
in
pulling
the
pram
off
me
but
when
we
laughed
the
first
thought
was
are
we
going
to
dodge
mrs
lister
it
was
a
nasty
problem
what
did
you
do
well
after
consultation
we
got
up
near
the
house
planting
the
pram
in
some
trees
we
dodged
through
the
shrubbery
until
we
reached
that
old
and
there
i
left
norah
and
scooted
over
to
the
stables
and
borrowed
an
overcoat
belonging
to
a
boy
we
had
working
and
a
pair
of
his
boots
dad
was
away
or
i
might
have
gone
straight
to
him
i
put
on
the
borrowed
things
over
my
wet
togs
and
very
nice
i
looked
and
trotted
off
to
the
side
of
the
house
no
one
seemed
about
so
i
slipped
into
my
room
through
the
window
and
then
into
norah
and
got
a
bundle
of
clothes
and
back
i
scooted
to
the
left
norah
things
there
and
found
a
for
myself
among
some
shrubs
close
by
well
do
you
know
that
old
cat
lister
had
seen
us
all
the
time
she
actually
spotted
us
coming
up
the
paddock
dripping
and
had
deliberately
planted
herself
to
see
what
we
do
she
knew
all
about
my
expedition
after
clothes
then
she
followed
us
to
the
shrubbery
and
descended
upon
us
like
an
avalanche
just
as
we
got
i
ask
what
you
naughty
little
children
are
doing
she
said
well
you
know
that
put
my
back
up
a
bit
i
was
nearly
twelve
and
dad
did
make
a
little
kid
of
me
however
i
tried
to
keep
civil
and
tell
her
what
had
happened
but
she
told
me
to
hold
my
tongue
she
grabbed
norah
by
the
shoulder
and
called
her
all
the
names
under
the
sun
and
shook
her
then
she
said
come
to
bed
at
once
miss
and
caught
hold
of
her
wrist
to
drag
her
in
now
norah
had
sprained
her
wrist
not
long
before
and
she
had
to
be
a
bit
careful
of
it
we
all
knew
that
she
did
cry
out
when
lister
jerked
her
wrist
but
i
saw
her
turn
white
and
knew
it
was
the
bad
so
he
chucked
himself
on
top
of
old
lister
and
pounded
her
as
hard
as
he
could
put
in
norah
and
she
was
so
astonished
she
let
me
go
she
turned
her
attention
to
jim
then
and
gave
him
a
terrible
whack
over
the
head
that
sent
him
flying
and
just
then
we
heard
a
voice
that
was
so
angry
we
hardly
recognised
it
for
dad
saying
is
this
all
about
my
word
we
were
glad
to
see
dad
said
jim
he
came
over
and
put
his
arm
round
norah
poor
little
kid
lister
had
screwed
her
wrist
till
it
was
worse
than
ever
it
had
been
and
she
was
as
white
as
a
sheet
dad
helped
her
on
with
her
clothes
all
the
time
lister
was
pouring
out
a
flood
of
eloquence
against
us
and
was
nearly
black
in
the
face
with
rage
dad
took
no
notice
until
norah
was
dressed
then
he
said
to
me
in
the
study
in
twenty
minutes
and
he
picked
norah
up
and
carried
her
inside
where
he
dosed
her
and
fixed
up
her
wrist
i
put
on
my
clothes
and
followed
them
norah
and
i
never
said
anything
until
lister
had
told
her
story
which
was
a
fine
production
little
truth
and
three
parts
awful
crams
then
dad
asked
for
our
side
and
we
just
told
him
he
knew
we
never
told
lies
and
he
believed
us
and
we
told
him
some
other
things
lister
used
to
do
to
us
in
the
way
of
bullying
and
spite
i
do
know
that
dad
needed
them
because
norah
wrist
spoke
louder
than
fifty
tales
and
he
did
need
any
more
evidence
though
after
all
she
might
have
grabbed
the
bad
wrist
by
mistake
and
she
had
done
far
worse
things
on
purpose
but
the
end
of
it
was
lister
departed
that
night
and
norah
and
i
danced
a
polka
in
the
hall
when
we
heard
the
buggy
drive
that
being
the
case
said
norah
gravely
we
all
have
an
the
apples
were
produced
and
discussed
and
then
it
was
time
to
think
of
home
for
the
sun
had
long
since
left
the
glistening
surface
of
the
falls
so
they
gathered
themselves
up
and
reluctantly
enough
left
the
beautiful
scene
behind
them
with
many
a
backward
look
the
way
home
was
rather
silent
the
shadow
of
the
boys
departure
was
over
them
all
and
norah
especially
felt
the
weight
of
approaching
loneliness
with
dad
at
home
it
would
have
been
easier
to
let
the
boys
go
but
the
prospect
of
several
days
by
herself
with
only
the
servants
for
company
was
not
a
very
comforting
one
norah
wished
dismally
that
she
had
been
born
a
boy
with
the
prospect
of
a
journey
and
mates
and
school
and
no
end
of
then
she
thought
of
dad
and
though
still
dismal
unwished
the
wish
and
was
content
to
remain
a
girl
there
was
a
little
excitement
on
the
homeward
trip
over
a
snake
which
tried
to
slip
away
unseen
through
the
grass
and
when
it
found
itself
surrounded
by
enemies
coiled
itself
round
harry
leg
a
proceeding
very
painful
to
that
youth
who
nevertheless
stood
like
a
statue
while
jim
dodged
about
for
a
chance
to
strike
at
the
wildly
waving
head
he
got
it
at
last
and
while
the
reptile
writhed
in
very
natural
annoyance
harry
managed
to
get
free
and
soon
put
a
respectful
distance
between
himself
and
his
acquaintance
jim
finished
up
the
snake
and
they
resumed
the
track
keeping
a
careful
and
imagining
another
in
every
rustle
well
done
old
harry
said
wally
stood
like
a
statue
you
did
thanks
said
harry
jim
the
chap
to
say
done
to
i
not
me
said
jim
easy
enough
to
try
to
kill
the
brute
i
rather
do
that
than
feel
him
round
my
leg
where
i
could
get
at
well
i
think
i
would
too
harry
said
laughing
i
never
felt
such
a
desire
to
stampede
in
my
it
was
beastly
affirmed
norah
she
was
a
little
pale
it
seemed
about
an
hour
before
he
poked
his
horrid
head
out
and
let
jim
get
a
whack
at
it
but
you
did
lose
much
time
then
jimmy
could
he
have
bitten
through
the
leg
of
your
pants
queried
wally
with
interest
he
could
have
sent
all
the
venom
through
i
think
jim
replied
but
enough
would
have
gone
to
make
a
very
sick
little
it
be
an
interesting
experiment
no
doubt
said
harry
but
if
you
do
mind
i
leave
it
for
someone
else
to
try
i
recommend
a
man
as
the
experimenter
he
feel
much
more
at
his
ease
while
the
snake
was
trying
how
much
venom
he
could
get
through
a
pant
leg
chapter
xi
i
was
just
to
ring
the
big
bell
said
brown
she
was
standing
on
the
front
verandah
as
the
children
came
up
the
lawn
why
we
not
late
brownie
are
we
asked
norah
not
the
old
housekeeper
smiled
at
her
only
when
your
pa
away
i
allers
feels
a
bit
nervis
about
you
sech
thoughtless
young
people
an
all
them
animals
and
snakes
about
gammon
said
jim
laughing
mean
to
say
i
ca
look
after
them
brownie
i
rather
not
say
anythink
rash
master
jim
rejoined
brown
with
a
twinkle
i
guess
brown
got
the
measure
of
your
foot
old
man
grinned
harry
oh
well
said
jim
resignedly
a
chap
never
gets
his
due
in
this
world
i
forgive
you
brownie
though
you
do
deserve
it
got
a
nice
tea
for
us
sech
as
it
is
master
jim
it
waitin
on
you
said
brown
with
point
that
what
you
might
call
a
broad
hint
cried
jim
come
on
chaps
race
you
for
a
they
scattered
brown
laying
violent
hands
on
the
indignant
norah
and
insisting
on
arraying
her
in
a
clean
frock
which
the
victim
resisted
as
totally
unnecessary
brown
carried
her
point
however
and
a
trim
little
maiden
joined
the
boys
in
the
five
minutes
later
brown
cooking
was
notable
and
she
had
excelled
herself
over
the
boys
farewell
tea
a
big
cold
turkey
sat
side
by
side
with
a
ham
of
majestic
dimensions
while
the
cool
green
of
a
salad
was
tempting
after
the
hot
walk
there
were
jellies
and
a
big
bowl
of
fruit
salad
while
the
centre
of
the
table
was
occupied
by
a
tall
cake
raising
aloft
glittering
white
tiers
there
were
scones
and
tarts
and
wee
cakes
and
dishes
of
fresh
fruit
and
altogether
the
boys
whistled
long
and
softly
and
declared
that
brownie
was
no
end
of
a
brick
whereat
brown
hovering
about
to
see
that
her
charges
wanted
nothing
smiled
and
blushed
and
said
get
on
now
do
jim
carved
and
jim
carving
was
something
to
marvel
at
no
method
came
amiss
to
him
when
he
could
cut
straight
he
did
at
other
times
he
sawed
and
when
it
seemed
necessary
he
dug
after
he
had
finished
helping
every
one
wally
said
that
the
turkey
looked
as
if
a
dog
had
been
at
it
and
the
ham
was
worse
which
remarks
jim
meekly
accepted
as
his
due
nor
did
the
inartistic
appearance
of
the
turkey
prevent
the
critic
from
coming
back
for
more
everyone
was
hungry
and
did
full
justice
to
brownie
forethought
while
norah
behind
the
tall
teapot
declared
that
it
was
a
job
for
two
men
and
a
boy
to
pour
out
for
such
a
thirsty
trio
harry
helped
the
fruit
salad
and
harry
helpings
were
based
on
his
own
hunger
and
would
have
suited
goliath
finally
norah
cut
the
cake
with
great
ceremony
and
wally
proposal
that
everyone
should
retire
to
the
lawn
with
a
chunk
was
carried
unanimously
out
on
the
grass
they
lay
and
chattered
while
the
dusk
came
down
and
slowly
a
pale
moon
climbed
up
into
the
sky
norah
alone
was
silent
after
a
while
harry
and
wally
declared
they
must
go
and
pack
and
jim
and
his
sister
were
left
alone
wally
and
harry
scurried
down
the
hail
the
sound
of
their
merry
voices
died
away
and
there
was
silence
on
the
lawn
jim
rolled
nearer
to
norah
blue
old
girl
said
a
muffled
voice
jim
felt
for
her
hand
in
the
darkness
and
found
it
the
small
brown
fingers
closed
tightly
round
his
rough
paw
i
know
he
said
comprehendingly
i
awfully
sorry
old
woman
i
do
wish
we
had
to
there
was
no
answer
jim
knew
why
and
also
knowing
perfectly
well
that
tears
would
mean
the
deepest
shame
he
talked
on
without
requiring
any
response
beastly
hard
luck
he
said
we
do
want
to
go
a
bit
fancy
school
after
this
ugh
but
there
are
three
of
us
so
it
is
so
bad
it
would
matter
if
dad
was
at
home
for
you
but
i
must
say
it
lowdown
to
be
leaving
you
all
by
your
lonely
little
norah
struggled
hard
with
that
abominable
lump
in
her
throat
despising
herself
heartily
brownie
be
awfully
good
to
you
went
on
jim
you
have
to
buck
up
you
know
old
girl
and
not
let
yourself
get
dull
you
practise
like
one
or
make
jam
or
something
or
get
brownie
to
let
you
do
some
cooking
anything
to
keep
you
broodin
on
bein
a
dorg
as
old
david
harum
says
there
all
the
pets
to
look
after
you
know
you
got
to
keep
young
black
billy
up
to
the
mark
or
never
feed
properly
and
if
you
let
him
alone
he
changes
the
water
in
the
dishes
when
the
last
lot
dry
and
by
george
norah
jim
had
a
bright
idea
dad
told
me
last
night
he
meant
to
shift
those
new
bullocks
into
the
long
plain
ten
to
one
he
forgot
all
about
it
going
away
so
suddenly
you
have
to
see
to
i
like
that
said
norah
feeling
doubtfully
for
her
voice
rather
best
thing
you
can
do
jim
said
eagerly

billy
with
you
of
course

a
dog

do
think
you
have
any
trouble
only
be
very
careful
to
get
all
examine
all
the
scrub
in
the
paddock
billy
knows
how
many

of
course
dad

have
left
directions

one
of
the

queried
norah
rather

forward

jim

busy
you

with
brownie

day
earlier

if

says

always
telling
me

to
bed
old
he
rose
and
pulled
her
to
her
feet
norah
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
a
very
rare
caress
good
night
she
said
i
i
do
love
you
jimmy
jim
hugged
her
same
here
old
chap
he
said
there
was
such
scurrying
in
the
early
morning
daylight
revealed
many
things
that
had
been
overlooked
in
the
packing
overnight
and
they
had
to
be
crammed
in
somehow
other
things
were
remembered
which
had
not
been
packed
and
which
must
be
found
and
diligent
hunt
had
to
be
made
for
them
norah
was
everybody
mate
running
on
several
errands
at
once
finding
jim
school
cap
near
harry
overcoat
while
she
was
looking
for
cherished
her
strong
brown
hands
pulled
tight
the
straps
of
bulging
bags
on
which
their
perspiring
owners
knelt
puffing
after
the
said
bags
were
closed
and
carried
out
to
the
buggy
she
found
the
three
toothbrushes
and
crammed
each
twisted
in
newspaper
into
its
pocket
she
had
no
time
to
think
she
was
dull
brown
who
had
been
up
since
dawn
had
packed
a
huge
hamper
and
superintended
its
placing
in
the
buggy
it
was
addressed
to
master
james
master
harry
and
master
wallie
and
later
jim
reported
that
its
contents
were
such
as
to
make
the
chaps
at
school
speechless
a
compliment
which
filled
brown
with
dismay
and
a
wish
that
she
had
put
in
less
pastry
and
perhaps
a
little
castor
oil
at
present
she
felt
mildly
safe
about
it
and
watched
it
loaded
with
a
sigh
of
relief
went
the
big
gong
and
the
boys
rushed
to
the
where
norah
was
ready
to
pour
out
tea
you
have
some
norah
said
harry
retaining
his
position
close
to
the
teapot
whence
wally
had
vainly
striven
to
dislodge
him
yes
old
girl
you
eat
some
breakfast
commanded
jim
norah
flashed
a
smile
at
him
over
the
cosy
lots
of
time
afterwards
she
said
a
little
sadly
no
time
like
the
wally
took
a
huge
bite
out
of
a
scone
and
surveyed
the
relic
with
interest
someone
put
a
smoking
plateful
before
him
and
his
further
utterances
were
lost
in
eggs
and
bacon
brown
flitted
about
like
a
stout
guardian
angel
keeping
an
especially
watchful
eye
on
jim
if
the
supply
on
his
plate
lessened
perceptibly
it
was
replenished
with
more
like
manna
from
above
to
his
laughing
protests
she
merely
murmured
poor
dear
lamb
whereat
wally
and
harry
laughed
consumedly
and
jim
blushed
well
you
beaten
me
at
last
brownie
jim
declared
finally
he
waved
away
a
chop
which
was
about
to
descend
upon
his
plate
no
truly
brownie
dear
there
are
limits
tea
no
thanks
norah
i
had
about
a
dozen
cups
already
i
believe
you
fellows
ready
they
were
and
the
table
was
briskly
deserted
there
was
a
final
survey
of
the
boys
room
which
resembled
a
rubbish
heap
owing
to
vigorous
packing
everybody
ran
wildly
about
looking
for
something
wally
was
found
searching
frantically
for
his
cap
which
norah
discovered
on
his
head
there
was
a
hurried
journey
to
the
kitchen
to
bid
the
servants
the
buggy
wheels
scrunched
the
gravel
before
the
hall
door
the
overseer
softly
all
aboard
all
right
evans
jim
appeared
in
the
doorway
staggering
under
a
big
gladstone
bag
billy
similarly
laden
followed
his
black
face
was
unusually
solemn
chuck
in
billy
come
on
you
chaps
the
chaps
appeared
norah
it
been
grand
harry
pumped
her
hand
vigorously
wish
you
were
coming
said
wally
dismally
write
to
us
wo
you
norah
now
then
master
jim
evans
glanced
at
his
watch
right
oh
said
jim
he
put
his
arm
round
the
little
girl
shoulders
and
looked
keenly
into
her
face
there
was
no
hint
of
breaking
down
norah
met
his
gaze
steadily
and
smiled
at
him
but
the
boy
knew
little
chap
he
said
and
kissed
her
you
keep
your
pecker
up
she
nodded
jimmy
old
jim
sprang
into
the
buggy
all
right
they
whirled
down
the
drive
looking
back
waving
their
caps
the
boys
carried
away
a
memory
of
a
brave
little
figure
erect
smiling
and
lonely
on
the
doorstep
chapter
xii
the
winfield
murder
the
next
few
days
went
by
slowly
enough
norah
followed
faithfully
all
jim
plans
for
her
amusement
she
practised
did
some
cooking
and
helped
brown
preserve
apricots
then
there
were
the
pets
to
look
to
and
best
of
all
the
bullocks
to
move
from
one
paddock
to
another
it
was
an
easy
job
and
evans
was
quite
willing
to
leave
it
to
norah
billy
and
a
dog
the
trio
made
a
great
business
of
it
and
managed
almost
to
forget
loneliness
in
the
work
of
hunting
through
the
scrub
and
chasing
the
big
sleepy
beasts
out
upon
the
clear
plain
there
were
supposed
to
be
in
the
paddock
but
norah
and
billy
mustered
and
were
exceedingly
proud
of
themselves
in
consequence
next
day
norah
persuaded
brown
to
allow
herself
to
be
driven
into
cunjee
there
was
nothing
particular
to
go
for
except
that
as
norah
said
they
would
get
the
mail
a
day
earlier
but
brown
was
not
likely
to
refuse
anything
that
would
chase
the
look
of
loneliness
from
her
charge
face
accordingly
they
set
off
after
an
early
lunch
norah
driving
the
pair
of
brown
ponies
in
a
light
single
buggy
that
barely
held
her
and
her
by
no
means
companion
the
road
was
good
and
they
made
the
distance
in
excellent
time
arriving
in
cunjee
to
see
the
daily
train
puff
its
way
out
of
the
station
then
they
separated
as
norah
had
no
opinion
whatever
of
shopping
principally
in
drapers
establishments
which
this
bush
maiden
hated
cordially
so
brown
unhampered
plunged
into
mysteries
of
flannel
and
sheeting
while
norah
strolled
up
the
principal
street
and
exchanged
greetings
with
those
she
knew
she
paused
by
the
door
of
a
blacksmith
shop
for
the
smith
and
she
were
old
friends
and
norah
regarded
blake
as
quite
the
principal
person
of
cunjee
generally
there
were
horses
to
be
looked
at
but
just
now
the
shop
was
empty
and
blake
came
forward
to
talk
to
the
girl
seen
the
out
your
way
he
asked
presently
after
the
weather
the
crops
and
the
dullness
of
business
had
been
exhausted
as
topics
police
queried
norah
no
why
there
was
two
mounted
men
rode
out
in
your
direction
yesterday
blake
answered
they
on
the
track
of
that
winfield
murderer
they
what
was
that
asked
norah
blankly
i
never
heard
of
not
heard
of
the
winfield
murder
why
you
ca
read
the
papers
missy
surely
no
of
course
i
do
norah
said
daddy
does
like
me
to
read
everyday
blake
nodded
no
i
not
he
said
you
too
young
to
worry
your
little
head
about
murders
and
suchlike
but
everybody
was
talkin
about
the
winfield
affair
so
i
sorter
took
it
for
granted
that
you
know
about

i
do
said
norah
what
is
it
all
about
there
not
very
much
i
can
tell
you
about
it
missy
blake
said
scratching
his
head
and
looking
down
at
the
grave
lace
nobody
knows
much
about
it
winfield
a
little
bit
of
a
place
about
twenty
miles
from
you
know
right
in
the
bush
and
away
from
any
rail
or
coach
line
a
couple
o
stores
an
a
hotel
an
a
few
houses
do
suppose
many
people
out
o
this
district
ever
heard
of
it
it
that
quiet
asleep
well
there
was
two
ol
men
livin
together
in
a
little
hut
a
mile
or
so
from
the
winfield
township
prospectors
they
said
they
were
there
was
an
idea
that
they
done
pretty
well
at
the
game
an
had
a
bit
of
gold
hidden
somewhere
about
their
camp
they
kept
very
much
to
themselves
an
never
mixed
with
anyone
when
one
o
them
came
into
the
township
for
stores
he
get
his
business
done
an
clear
out
as
quick
as
possible
well
about
a
month
ago
two
fellows
called
bowen
was
riding
along
a
bush
track
between
winfield
an
their
camp
when
they
came
across
one
the
ol
mates
peggin
along
the
track
for
all
he
was
worth
they
was
surprised
to
see
that
he
was
carryin
a
big
swag
an
was
apparently
on
a
move
harris
they
says
the
district
he
was
a
civil
spoken
ol
chap
as
a
rule
so
they
was
rather
surprised
when
he
give
a
sort
o
grunt
an
hurried
on
they
was
after
cattle
and
pretty
late
the
same
day
they
found
themselves
near
the
hut
where
the
two
ol
chaps
lived
an
as
they
was
hungry
an
thirsty
they
reckoned
they
call
in
an
see
if
they
could
get
a
feed
so
they
rode
up
and
tied
their
horses
to
a
tree
and
walked
up
to
the
hut
no
one
answered
their
knock
so
they
opened
the
door
walked
in
there
lyin
on
his
bunk
was
ol
waters
they
spoke
to
him
but
he
did
answer
you
see
missy
he
could
bein
dead
said
norah
her
eyes
dilating
blake
nodded
stone
dead
he
said
they
thought
at
first
he
just
died
natural
as
there
was
no
mark
o
violence
on
but
when
they
got
a
doctor
to
examine
he
soon
found
out
very
different
the
poor
ol
feller
been
poisoned
missy
the
doctor
said
must
a
bin
dead
twelve
hours
when
the
bowens
found
everything
of
value
was
gone
from
the
hut
along
with
his
mate
old
harris
the
villain
he
must
be
why
do
they
think
he
killed
the
other
man
norah
asked
seems
pretty
certain
missy
blake
replied
in
fact
there
do
seem
the
shadder
of
a
doubt
he
was
comin
straight
from
the
hut
when
the
bowens
met
an
he
cleared
out
the
whole
place
gold
an
all
oh
there
ai
any
doubt
about
harris
bein
the
guilty
party
the
only
thing
doubtful
is
harris
have
the
police
been
looking
for
him
asked
norah
huntin
high
an
low
without
any
luck
he
seems
to
have
vanished
off
the
earth
they
bin
follerin
up
first
one
clue
and
then
another
without
any
result
now
the
last
is
that
he
been
seen
somewhere
the
other
side
of
your
place
an
two
troopers
have
gone
out
to
see
if
there
any
truth
in
the
i
think
it
awfully
exciting
norah
said
but
i
terribly
sorry
for
the
poor
man
who
was
killed
what
a
wicked
old
wretch
the
other
must
be
his
own
mate
too
i
wonder
what
he
was
like
did
you
know
him
well
i
seen
old
harris
a
few
times
not
often
blake
replied
still
he
was
the
sort
of
old
man
you
forget
not
a
old
chap
he
was
very
tall
and
well
set
up
with
piercin
blue
eyes
long
white
hair
an
beard
an
a
pretty
uppish
way
of
talkin
i
fancy
anyone
about
here
knew
him
very
well
he
had
a
way
of
keepin
to
himself
one
thing
there
plenty
lookin
out
for
him
i
suppose
so
norah
said
i
wonder
will
he
really
get
away
mighty
small
chance
said
blake
still
it
wonderful
how
managed
to
keep
out
of
sight
for
so
long
of
course
once
in
the
bush
it
might
be
hard
to
find
him
but
sooner
or
later
he
must
come
out
to
some
township
for
tucker
an
then
everyone
will
be
lookin
out
for
him
they
may
have
got
him
up
your
way
by
now
missy
is
your
pa
at
home
he
coming
home
in
a
day
or
two
norah
said
perhaps
i
hope
they
wo
find
harris
and
bring
him
to
our
well
it
all
depends
on
where
they
find
him
if
they
do
get
him
blake
replied
possibly
they
might
find
the
station
a
handy
place
to
stop
at
however
missy
do
you
worry
your
head
about
it
nothing
for
you
to
be
frightened
why
i
not
frightened
norah
said
it
has
got
anything
to
do
with
me
only
i
do
want
to
see
a
man
who
could
kill
his
mate
he
much
like
any
other
man
said
blake
philosophically
say
someone
comin
after
you
missy
i
i
thought
i
find
you
here
exclaimed
brown
fat
comfortable
voice
as
its
owner
puffed
her
way
up
the
slope
leading
to
the
blacksmith
good
afternoon
blake
i
finished
all
my
shopping
miss
norah
my
dear
and
the
mail
in
and
here
a
letter
for
you
as
you
wo
be
sorry
to
from
dad
how
lovely
and
norah
snatching
at
the
grey
envelope
with
its
big
black
writing
tore
it
open
hastily
at
the
first
few
words
she
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
oh
he
coming
home
brownie
only
another
day
he
says
he
thinks
it
time
he
was
home
with
murderers
roaming
about
the
district
and
norah
executed
a
few
steps
of
a
highland
fling
greatly
to
the
edification
of
the
blacksmith
dear
sakes
alive
said
brown
truculently
i
think
there
are
enough
of
us
at
the
station
to
look
after
you
murderer
or
no
murderer
not
as
but
that
must
be
a
nasty
creature
still
very
glad
your
pa
coming
miss
norah
because
nothing
do
seem
right
when
he
away
an
it
dull
for
you
all
master
jim
gone
back
i
queried
blake
yesterday
norah
added
then
you
must
be
lonely
the
old
blacksmith
said
taking
norah
small
brown
hand
and
holding
it
for
a
moment
in
his
horny
fist
very
much
as
if
he
feared
it
were
an
eggshell
and
not
to
be
dropped
master
growing
a
big
fellow
too
goin
to
be
as
big
a
man
as
his
father
i
believe
well
missy
and
do
forget
to
come
in
next
time
you
in
the
there
was
nothing
further
to
detain
them
in
cunjee
and
very
soon
the
ponies
were
fetched
from
the
stables
and
they
were
bowling
out
along
the
smooth
metal
road
that
wound
its
way
across
the
plain
and
norah
was
mingling
excited
little
outbursts
of
delight
over
her
father
return
with
frequent
searches
into
a
big
bag
of
sweets
which
brown
had
thoughtfully
placed
on
the
seat
of
the
buggy
i
do
know
why
blake
wanted
to
go
telling
you
about
that
nasty
murderer
brown
said
they
were
ten
miles
from
cunjee
and
the
metal
road
had
given
place
to
a
bush
track
in
very
fair
order
why
not
asked
norah
with
the
carelessness
of
twelve
years
well
tales
of
murders
are
the
things
for
young
ladies
ears
brown
said
primly
your
pa
never
tells
you
such
things
the
been
full
of
this
murder
but
i
would
scorned
to
talk
to
you
about
i
do
think
blake
meant
any
harm
said
norah
he
did
say
so
very
much
i
do
suppose
he
have
mentioned
it
only
that
harris
is
supposed
to
have
come
our
way
and
even
that
does
seem
baffled
the
police
said
brown
with
the
solemn
pride
felt
by
so
many
at
the
worsting
of
the
guardians
of
the
law
they
reely
know
anythink
about
his
movements
that
my
belief
why
weeks
since
he
was
seen
this
yarn
about
his
comin
this
way
is
got
up
to
the
fact
that
they
do
know
a
thing
about
it
i
he
anywhere
within
of
our
place
might
be
out
of
the
country
now
for
all
anyone
sure
blake
seemed
to
think
he
really
come
this
way
norah
said
blake
an
iggerant
man
said
brown
loftily
well
i
keep
a
for
him
at
any
rate
laughed
norah
he
ought
to
be
easy
enough
to
find
tall
and
and
well
set
up
whatever
that
may
mean
and
long
white
beard
and
hair
he
must
be
a
pretty
sort
of
old
man
i
and
then
recollection
swept
over
norah
like
a
flood
and
her
words
faltered
on
her
lips
her
hand
gripped
the
reins
tighter
and
she
drove
on
unconsciously
blake
words
were
beating
in
her
ears
not
a
old
chap
very
tall
and
well
set
up
piercing
blue
eyes
and
a
pretty
uppish
way
of
the
description
had
meant
nothing
to
her
until
someone
whom
it
fitted
all
too
aptly
had
drifted
across
her
mental
vision
the
hermit
even
while
she
felt
and
told
herself
that
it
could
not
be
the
fatal
accuracy
of
the
likeness
made
her
shudder
it
was
perfect
the
tall
old
man
not
the
sort
of
old
man
you
forget
with
his
distinguished
look
the
piercing
blue
eyes
but
norah
knew
what
kindliness
lay
in
their
depths
the
gentle
refined
voice
so
different
from
most
of
the
rough
country
voices
it
would
answer
to
pretty
uppish
way
of
anyone
who
had
read
the
description
would
on
meeting
the
hermit
immediately
identify
him
as
the
man
for
whom
the
police
were
searching
norah
common
sense
told
her
that
a
wave
of
horror
swept
over
the
little
girl
and
the
hands
gripping
the
reins
trembled
common
sense
might
tell
one
tale
but
every
instinct
of
her
heart
told
a
very
different
one
that
old
man
with
a
world
of
kindness
in
his
tired
eyes
he
the
man
who
killed
his
sleeping
mate
for
a
handful
of
gold
norah
set
her
square
little
chin
she
would
not
could
not
believe
it
why
you
very
quiet
brown
glanced
inquiringly
at
her
companion
a
minute
ago
you
was
chatterin
and
now
you
gone
down
flat
like
old
is
anything
wrong
no
i
all
right
brownie
i
was
only
thinking
said
norah
forcing
a
smile
too
many
sweeties
i
expect
said
brown
laying
a
heavy
hand
on
the
bag
and
impounding
it
for
future
reference
must
have
you
get
indigestion
an
your
pa
comin
home
norah
laughed
now
did
you
ever
know
me
to
have
indigestion
in
my
life
she
queried
well
perhaps
not
brown
admitted
still
you
never
can
tell
it
don
do
to
pride
oneself
on
anything
if
it
ai
indigestion
been
thinking
too
much
of
this
narsty
norah
flicked
the
off
pony
deliberately
with
her
whip
darkie
is
getting
disgracefully
lazy
she
said
he
not
doing
a
bit
of
the
work
nigger
worth
two
of
the
injured
darkie
shot
forward
with
a
bound
and
brown
grabbed
the
side
of
the
buggy
hastily
and
in
her
fears
at
the
pace
for
the
ensuing
five
minutes
forgot
her
too
inconvenient
norah
settled
back
into
silence
her
forehead
puckered
with
a
frown
she
had
never
in
her
careless
little
life
been
confronted
by
such
a
problem
as
the
one
that
now
held
her
thoughts
that
the
startling
similarity
between
her
friend
and
the
description
of
the
murderer
should
fasten
upon
her
mind
was
unavoidable
she
struggled
against
the
idea
as
disloyal
but
finally
decided
to
think
it
out
calmly
the
descriptions
tallied
so
much
was
certain
the
verbal
likeness
of
one
man
was
an
exact
word
painting
of
the
other
so
far
as
it
went
though
as
poor
norah
reflected
you
ca
always
tell
a
person
just
by
hearing
what
he
then
there
was
no
denying
that
the
conduct
of
the
hermit
would
excite
suspicion
he
was
camping
alone
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
a
lonely
tract
of
scrub
he
had
been
there
some
weeks
and
she
had
had
plenty
of
proof
that
he
was
taken
aback
at
being
discovered
and
wished
earnestly
that
no
future
prowlers
might
find
their
way
to
his
retreat
she
recalled
his
shrinking
from
the
boys
and
his
hasty
refusal
to
go
to
the
homestead
he
had
said
in
so
many
words
that
he
desired
nothing
so
much
as
to
be
left
alone
any
one
would
have
gathered
that
he
feared
discovery
they
had
all
been
conscious
of
the
mystery
about
him
her
thoughts
flew
back
to
the
conversation
between
harry
and
wally
when
they
had
actually
speculated
as
to
why
he
was
hiding
putting
the
case
fairly
and
squarely
norah
had
to
admit
that
it
looked
black
against
the
hermit
against
it
what
had
she
no
proof
only
a
remembrance
of
two
honest
eyes
looking
sadly
at
her
of
a
face
that
had
irresistibly
drawn
her
confidence
and
friendship
of
a
voice
whose
tones
had
seemed
to
echo
sincerity
and
kindness
it
was
absolutely
beyond
norah
power
to
believe
that
the
hand
that
had
held
hers
so
gently
could
have
been
the
one
to
strike
to
death
an
unsuspecting
mate
her
whole
nature
revolted
against
the
thought
that
her
friend
could
be
so
base
he
was
in
trouble
norah
said
over
and
over
again
in
her
uneasy
mind
he
was
unhappy
but
i
know
he
was
wicked
why
bobs
made
friends
with
him
the
thought
put
fresh
confidence
in
her
mind
bobs
always
knew
a
good
i
wo
say
anything
she
decided
at
last
as
they
wheeled
round
the
corner
of
the
homestead
if
they
knew
there
was
a
tall
old
man
there
they
go
and
hunt
him
out
and
annoy
him
horribly
i
know
he
all
right
i
hold
my
tongue
about
him
altogether
even
to
the
coach
dropped
linton
next
day
at
the
cross
roads
where
a
little
figure
clad
in
white
linen
sat
in
the
buggy
holding
the
brown
ponies
while
the
dusky
billy
was
an
attendant
sprite
on
his
piebald
mare
well
my
little
girl
it
good
to
see
you
again
linton
said
putting
his
gladstone
bag
into
the
buggy
and
receiving
undismayed
a
small
avalanche
of
little
daughter
upon
his
neck
steady
dear
mind
the
he
jumped
in
and
put
his
arm
round
her
everything
well
yes
all
right
daddy
i
so
glad
to
have
you
back
not
gladder
than
i
am
to
get
back
my
little
lass
said
her
father
billy
let
go
did
you
see
jim
asked
norah
as
the
ponies
bounded
forward
no
missed
him
i
had
only
an
hour
in
town
and
went
out
to
the
school
to
find
master
jim
had
gone
down
the
river
rowing
practice
i
was
sorry
to
miss
him
but
it
was
worth
waiting
another
day
in
jim
would
be
sorry
said
norah
thoughtfully
she
herself
was
rather
glad
had
jim
seen
his
father
most
probably
he
would
have
mentioned
the
hermit
now
she
had
only
his
letters
to
fear
and
as
jim
letters
were
of
the
briefest
nature
and
very
far
apart
it
was
not
an
acute
danger
yes
i
suppose
he
would
linton
replied
i
regretted
not
having
sent
a
telegram
to
say
i
was
going
to
the
school
it
slipped
my
memory
i
had
rather
a
rush
you
know
i
suppose
you
been
pretty
dull
my
girlie
oh
it
was
horrid
after
the
boys
went
norah
said
i
did
know
what
to
do
with
myself
and
the
house
was
terribly
quiet
it
was
hard
luck
that
you
had
to
go
away
yes
i
was
very
sorry
it
happened
so
her
father
said
had
we
been
alone
together
i
have
taken
you
with
me
but
we
have
the
trip
some
other
time
did
you
have
a
good
day
fishing
on
saturday
yes
said
norah
flushing
a
little
guiltily
the
natural
impulse
to
tell
all
about
their
friend
the
hermit
was
so
strong
we
had
a
lovely
day
and
caught
ever
so
many
fish
did
get
home
till
ever
so
late
the
only
bad
part
was
finding
you
away
when
we
got
well
i
glad
you
had
good
luck
at
any
rate
linton
said
so
anglers
bend
is
keeping
up
its
reputation
eh
we
have
to
go
out
there
i
think
norah
what
do
you
say
about
it
would
you
and
billy
like
a
three
days
jaunt
on
fishing
bent
oh
it
would
be
glorious
daddy
camping
out
well
of
course
since
we
be
away
three
days
in
this
weather
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
to
do
i
you
are
a
blessed
daddy
declared
his
daughter
rubbing
her
cheek
against
his
shoulder
i
never
knew
anyone
with
such
beautiful
she
jigged
on
her
seat
with
delight
oh
and
daddy
i
be
able
to
put
you
on
to
such
a
splendid
new
hole
for
fishing
will
you
indeed
said
linton
smiling
at
the
flushed
face
that
good
dear
but
how
did
you
discover
it
norah
face
fell
suddenly
she
hesitated
and
looked
uncomfortable
oh
she
said
slowly
i
we
found
it
out
last
well
we
go
norah
as
soon
as
i
can
fix
it
up
said
her
father
and
now
have
you
heard
anything
about
the
winfield
murderer
not
a
thing
daddy
brownie
thinks
it
just
a
yarn
that
he
was
seen
about
oh
i
do
think
so
at
all
linton
said
a
good
many
people
have
the
idea
at
any
rate
of
course
they
may
be
wrong
i
afraid
brownie
is
rather
too
ready
to
form
wild
opinions
on
some
matters
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
rather
worried
at
the
reports
i
do
fancy
the
notion
of
escaped
gentry
of
that
kind
wandering
round
in
the
vicinity
of
my
small
well
i
do
think
you
need
have
worried
said
norah
laughing
up
at
him
but
all
the
same
i
not
a
bit
sorry
you
did
if
it
brought
you
home
a
day
earlier
dad
well
it
certainly
did
said
linton
pulling
her
ear
but
i
not
sorry
either
i
ca
stand
more
than
a
day
or
two
in
town
as
for
the
murderer
i
not
going
to
waste
any
thought
on
him
now
that
i
am
here
there
the
gate
and
here
comes
billy
like
a
whirlwind
to
open
they
bowled
through
the
gate
and
up
the
long
drive
under
the
arching
boughs
of
the
big
gum
trees
that
formed
a
natural
avenue
on
each
side
at
the
garden
gate
brown
stood
waiting
with
a
broad
smile
of
welcome
and
a
chorus
of
barks
testified
to
the
arrival
of
sundry
dogs
it
a
real
linton
said
as
he
walked
up
the
path
his
hand
on
norah
shoulder
and
the
little
girl
answering
smile
needed
no
words
they
turned
the
corner
by
the
big
rose
bush
and
came
within
view
of
the
house
and
suddenly
norah
smile
faded
a
trooper
in
dusty
uniform
stood
on
the
doorstep
why
that
a
pleasant
object
to
greet
a
man
linton
said
as
the
policeman
turned
and
came
to
meet
him
with
a
civil
salute
he
nodded
as
the
man
came
up
did
you
want
me
it
only
about
this
murderer
sir
said
the
trooper
some
of
us
is
on
a
sort
of
a
scent
but
we
have
got
fairly
on
to
his
tracks
yet
i
ridden
from
mulgoa
and
i
came
to
ask
if
your
people
had
seen
anything
of
such
a
chap
passing
as
a
swaggie
or
anything
not
that
i
know
of
said
linton
what
is
he
like
big
fellow
old
plenty
of
white
hair
and
beard
though
of
course
they
probably
cut
off
by
this
time
very
old
chap
said
the
trooper
reflectively
an
a
good
way
of
well
i
seen
no
such
man
said
linton
decidedly
of
course
though
i
do
see
all
the
who
call
perhaps
brown
can
help
not
me
sir
said
brown
with
firmness
there
ai
been
no
such
a
person
and
you
may
be
sure
there
ai
none
i
do
see
fact
is
when
i
saw
as
the
murderer
was
supposed
to
be
in
this
districk
i
made
inquiries
amongst
the
men
the
white
hands
that
is
and
none
of
them
had
seen
any
such
man
as
the
papers
described
i
reckon
may
just
as
well
be
in
any
other
districk
as
this
i
the
poor
must
say
somewheres
she
glared
defiantly
at
the
downcast
trooper
wish
you
had
the
job
of
findin
him
mum
said
that
individual
well
sir
there
no
one
else
i
could
make
inquiries
of
is
there
mrs
brown
seems
to
have
gone
the
rounds
linton
said
i
really
do
think
there
any
one
else
unless
my
small
daughter
here
can
help
you
he
added
laughingly
but
norah
had
slipped
away
foreseeing
possible
questioning
the
trooper
smiled
do
think
i
need
worry
such
a
small
witness
he
said
no
i
just
move
on
linton
i
beginning
to
think
i
on
a
chapter
xiii
the
circus
the
days
went
by
but
no
further
word
of
the
winfield
murderer
came
to
the
anxious
ears
of
the
little
girl
at
billabong
homestead
norah
never
read
the
papers
and
could
not
therefore
satisfy
her
mind
by
their
reports
but
all
her
inquiries
were
met
by
the
same
reply
nothing
the
police
were
still
in
the
district
so
much
she
knew
for
she
had
caught
glimpses
of
them
when
out
riding
with
her
father
the
men
in
dusty
uniforms
were
unusual
figures
in
those
quiet
parts
but
norah
could
not
manage
to
discover
if
they
had
searched
the
scrub
that
hid
the
hermit
simple
camp
and
the
mystery
of
the
winfield
murder
seemed
as
far
from
being
cleared
up
as
ever
meanwhile
there
was
plenty
to
distract
her
mind
from
such
disquieting
matters
the
station
work
happened
to
be
particularly
engrossing
just
then
and
day
after
day
saw
norah
in
the
saddle
close
to
her
big
black
mare
riding
over
hills
and
plains
bringing
up
the
slow
sheep
or
galloping
gloriously
after
cattle
that
declined
to
be
mustered
there
were
visits
of
inspection
to
be
made
to
the
farthest
portions
of
the
run
and
busy
days
in
the
yards
when
the
men
worked
at
drafting
the
stock
and
norah
sat
perched
on
the
high
cap
of
a
fence
and
watching
with
all
her
eager
little
soul
in
her
eyes
wished
heartily
that
she
had
been
born
a
boy
then
there
were
a
couple
of
trips
with
linton
to
outlying
townships
and
on
one
of
these
occasions
norah
had
a
piece
of
marvellous
luck
for
there
was
actually
a
circus
in
cunjee
a
real
magnificent
circus
with
lions
and
tigers
and
hyaenas
and
a
camel
and
other
beautiful
animals
and
best
of
all
a
splendid
elephant
of
meek
and
mild
demeanour
it
was
the
elephant
that
broke
up
norah
calmness
oh
daddy
she
said
daddy
oh
ca
we
stay
linton
laughed
i
was
expecting
that
he
said
stay
and
what
would
brownie
be
thinking
norah
face
fell
oh
she
said
i
forgotten
brownie
i
it
would
do
but
is
it
a
glorious
elephant
daddy
it
is
indeed
said
linton
laughing
i
think
it
too
glorious
to
leave
girlie
fact
is
i
had
an
inkling
the
circus
was
to
be
here
so
i
told
brownie
not
to
expect
us
until
she
saw
us
she
put
a
basket
in
the
buggy
with
your
i
the
face
of
his
small
daughter
was
sufficient
reward
daddy
she
said
oh
but
you
are
the
most
daddy
words
failed
her
at
that
point
norah
said
that
it
was
a
most
wonderful
they
had
dinner
at
the
hotel
where
the
waiter
called
her
miss
linton
and
in
all
ways
behaved
precisely
as
if
she
were
grown
up
and
after
dinner
she
and
her
father
sat
on
the
balcony
while
linton
smoked
and
norah
watched
the
population
arriving
to
attend
the
circus
they
came
from
all
quarters
comfortable
old
farm
wagons
containing
whole
families
a
few
smart
buggies
but
the
majority
came
on
horseback
old
as
well
as
young
the
girls
rode
in
their
dresses
or
else
had
slipped
on
habit
skirts
over
their
gayer
attire
with
great
indifference
as
to
whether
it
happened
to
be
crushed
and
they
had
huge
hats
trimmed
with
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
norah
did
not
know
much
about
dress
but
it
seemed
to
her
theirs
was
queer
but
one
and
all
looked
so
happy
and
excited
that
dress
was
the
last
thing
that
mattered
it
seemed
to
norah
a
long
while
before
linton
shook
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
deliberately
and
pulled
out
his
watch
she
was
inwardly
dancing
with
impatience
seven
remarked
her
father
shutting
up
his
watch
with
a
click
well
i
suppose
we
better
go
norah
all
ready
dear
yes
daddy
must
i
wear
gloves
why
not
that
i
know
of
said
her
father
looking
puzzled
hardly
necessary
i
think
i
do
wear
do
you
want
to
goodness
no
said
his
daughter
hastily
well
that
all
right
said
linton
stow
them
in
my
pocket
and
come
out
in
the
street
there
were
unusual
signs
of
bustle
people
were
hurrying
along
the
footpath
the
blare
of
brass
instruments
came
from
the
big
circus
tent
round
which
was
lingering
every
small
boy
of
cunjee
who
could
not
gain
admission
horses
were
tied
to
adjoining
fences
considerably
disquieted
by
the
brazen
strains
of
the
band
it
was
very
cheerful
and
inspiring
and
norah
capered
gently
as
she
trotted
along
by
her
father
linton
gave
up
his
tickets
at
the
first
tent
and
they
passed
in
to
view
the
menagerie
a
queer
collection
but
wonderful
enough
in
the
eyes
of
cunjee
the
big
elephant
held
pride
of
place
as
he
stood
in
his
corner
and
sleepily
waved
his
trunk
at
the
aggravating
flies
norah
loved
him
from
the
first
and
in
a
moment
was
stroking
his
trunk
somewhat
to
her
father
anxiety
i
hope
he
safe
he
asked
an
attendant
bless
you
yes
sir
said
that
worthy
resplendent
in
dingy
scarlet
uniform
he
alwuz
knows
if
people
ai
afraid
of
him
try
him
with
this
this
was
an
apple
and
jumbo
deigned
to
accept
it
at
norah
hands
and
crunched
it
serenely
he
just
dear
said
norah
parting
reluctantly
from
the
huge
swaying
brute
and
giving
him
a
final
pat
as
she
went
better
than
bobs
asked
her
father
pooh
said
norah
loftily
what
this
rum
thing
a
wildebeest
read
her
father
he
does
look
like
pretty
tame
beast
i
think
norah
observed
surveying
the
animal
before
her
show
me
something
really
wild
how
about
this
chap
asked
linton
they
were
before
the
tiger
cage
and
the
big
yellow
brute
was
walking
up
and
down
with
long
stealthy
strides
his
great
eyes
roving
over
the
curious
faces
in
front
of
him
some
one
poked
a
stick
at
him
an
attention
which
met
an
instant
roar
and
spring
on
the
tiger
part
and
a
quick
and
stinging
rebuke
from
an
attendant
before
which
the
poker
of
the
stick
fled
precipitately
the
crowd
which
had
jumped
back
as
one
man
pressed
nearer
to
the
cage
and
the
tiger
resumed
his
quick
silent
prowl
but
his
eyes
no
longer
roved
over
the
faces
they
remained
fixed
upon
the
man
who
had
provoked
him
how
do
you
like
him
linton
asked
his
daughter
norah
hesitated
he
not
nice
of
course
she
said
but
i
so
awfully
sorry
for
him
are
you
daddy
it
does
seem
horrible
a
great
splendid
thing
like
that
shut
up
for
always
in
that
little
box
of
a
cage
you
feel
he
really
ought
to
have
a
great
stretch
of
jungle
to
roam
and
eat
men
in
i
think
he
better
where
he
well
you
think
the
world
was
big
enough
for
him
to
have
a
place
apart
from
men
altogether
said
norah
holding
to
her
point
sturdily
somewhere
that
is
much
wanted
a
sandy
desert
or
a
spare
alp
this
does
seem
right
somehow
i
think
i
seen
enough
animals
daddy
and
it
smelly
here
let
go
into
the
the
circus
tent
was
fairly
crowded
as
norah
and
her
father
made
their
way
in
and
took
the
seats
reserved
for
them
under
the
direction
of
another
official
in
dingy
scarlet
round
the
ring
the
tiers
of
seats
rose
abruptly
each
tier
a
mass
of
eager
interested
faces
a
lame
seller
of
fruit
and
drinks
hobbled
about
crying
his
wares
at
intervals
came
the
pop
of
a
lemonade
bottle
and
there
was
a
steady
crunching
of
peanut
shells
the
scent
of
orange
peel
rose
over
the
circus
smell
that
weird
compound
of
animal
and
sawdust
and
acetylene
lamps
in
the
midst
of
all
was
the
ring
with
its
surface
banked
up
towards
the
outer
edge
they
had
hardly
taken
their
seats
when
the
band
suddenly
struck
up
in
its
perch
near
the
entrance
and
the
company
entered
to
the
inspiring
strains
first
came
the
elephant
very
lazy
and
stately
gorgeously
caparisoned
now
with
a
gaily
attired
mahout
upon
his
neck
behind
him
came
the
camel
and
the
cages
with
the
other
occupants
of
the
menagerie
looking
either
bored
or
fierce
they
circled
round
the
ring
and
then
filed
out
the
band
struck
up
a
fresh
strain
and
in
cantered
a
lovely
lady
on
a
chestnut
horse
she
wore
a
scarlet
hat
and
habit
and
looked
to
norah
very
like
a
christmas
card
round
the
ring
she
dashed
gaily
and
behind
her
came
another
lady
equally
beautiful
in
a
green
habit
on
a
black
horse
and
a
third
wearing
a
habit
of
pale
blue
plush
who
managed
a
piebald
horse
then
came
some
girls
in
bright
frocks
on
beautiful
ponies
and
some
boys
in
tights
on
other
ponies
and
then
men
also
in
tights
of
every
colour
in
the
rainbow
who
rode
round
with
bored
expressions
as
if
it
were
really
too
slow
a
thing
merely
to
sit
on
a
horse
back
instead
of
pirouetting
there
upon
one
foot
they
flashed
round
once
or
twice
and
were
gone
and
norah
sat
back
and
gasped
feeling
that
she
had
had
a
glimpse
into
another
world
as
indeed
she
had
a
little
figure
whirled
into
the
ring
a
tiny
girl
on
a
pony
she
was
sitting
sideways
at
first
but
as
the
pony
settled
into
its
stride
round
the
ring
she
suddenly
leaped
to
her
feet
and
standing
poised
kissed
her
hands
gaily
to
the
audience
then
she
capered
first
on
one
foot
then
on
another
she
sat
down
facing
the
tail
and
lay
flat
along
the
pony
back
she
assumed
every
position
except
the
natural
one
she
leapt
to
the
ground
to
norah
intense
horror
who
imagined
she
did
mean
to
and
running
fiercely
at
the
pony
sprang
on
his
back
again
while
he
galloped
the
harder
lastly
she
dropped
a
handkerchief
which
she
easily
recovered
by
the
simple
expedient
of
hanging
head
downwards
suspended
by
one
foot
and
then
galloped
out
of
the
ring
amid
the
frantic
applause
of
cunjee
could
you
do
that
norah
laughed
linton
me
said
norah
amazedly
me
oh
fancy
me
ever
thinking
i
could
ride
a
bit
one
of
the
lovely
ladies
in
a
glistening
suit
of
black
covered
with
spangles
next
entered
she
also
preferred
to
ride
standing
but
was
by
no
means
idle
a
gentleman
in
the
ring
obligingly
handed
her
up
many
necessaries
plates
and
saucers
and
knives
and
she
threw
these
about
the
air
as
she
galloped
with
great
apparent
carelessness
yet
never
failed
to
catch
each
just
as
it
seemed
certain
to
fall
tiring
of
this
pursuit
she
flung
them
all
back
at
the
gentleman
with
deadly
aim
while
he
resenting
nothing
caught
them
cleverly
and
disposed
of
them
to
a
clown
who
stood
by
then
the
gentleman
hung
bright
ribbons
across
the
ring
apparently
with
the
unpleasant
intention
of
sweeping
the
lady
from
her
horse
an
intention
which
she
frustrated
by
lightly
leaping
over
each
in
turn
while
her
horse
galloped
beneath
it
finally
the
gentleman
whose
ideas
really
seemed
most
unfriendly
suddenly
confronted
her
with
a
great
hoop
the
very
sight
of
which
would
have
made
an
ordinary
horse
shy
wildly
but
even
at
this
obstacle
the
lady
did
not
lose
courage
instead
she
leaped
straight
through
the
hoop
paper
and
all
and
was
carried
out
by
her
faithful
steed
amidst
yells
of
applause
norah
gasped
oh
is
it
perfectly
lovely
daddy
she
said
perhaps
you
boys
and
girls
who
live
in
cities
or
near
townships
where
travelling
companies
pay
yearly
visits
can
have
no
idea
of
what
this
first
circus
meant
to
this
little
bush
maid
who
had
lived
all
her
twelve
years
without
seeing
anything
half
so
wonderful
perhaps
too
you
are
lucky
to
have
so
many
chances
of
seeing
things
but
it
is
something
to
possess
nowadays
even
at
twelve
the
unspoiled
fresh
mind
that
norah
brought
to
her
first
circus
everything
was
absolutely
real
to
her
the
clown
was
a
being
almost
too
good
for
this
world
seeing
that
his
whole
time
was
spent
in
making
people
laugh
uproariously
and
that
he
was
so
wonderfully
unselfish
in
the
way
he
allowed
himself
to
be
kicked
and
knocked
about
always
landing
in
positions
so
excruciatingly
droll
that
you
quite
forgot
to
ask
if
he
were
hurt
all
the
ladies
who
galloped
round
the
ring
and
did
such
marvellous
things
treating
a
mettled
steed
as
though
he
were
as
motionless
as
a
kitchen
table
seemed
to
norah
models
of
beauty
and
grace
there
was
one
who
set
her
heart
beating
by
her
daring
for
she
not
only
leaped
through
a
hoop
but
through
three
one
after
the
other
and
then
marvel
of
marvels
through
one
on
which
the
paper
was
alight
and
blazing
fiercely
norah
held
her
breath
expecting
to
see
her
scorched
and
smouldering
at
the
very
least
but
the
heroic
rider
galloped
on
without
seeming
so
much
as
singed
almost
as
wonderful
was
the
total
indifference
of
the
horses
to
the
strange
sights
around
them
bobs
would
be
off
his
head
said
norah
she
was
especially
enchanted
with
a
small
boy
and
girl
who
rode
in
on
the
same
brown
pony
and
had
all
sorts
of
capers
as
much
off
the
back
as
upon
it
not
that
it
troubled
them
to
be
off
because
they
simply
ran
together
at
the
pony
and
landed
simultaneously
standing
on
his
back
while
the
gallant
steed
galloped
the
more
furiously
they
hung
head
downwards
while
the
pony
jumped
over
hurdles
to
their
great
apparent
danger
they
even
wrestled
standing
and
the
girl
pitched
the
boy
off
to
the
accompaniment
of
loud
strains
from
the
band
and
wild
cheers
from
cunjee
not
that
the
boy
minded
he
picked
himself
up
and
raced
the
pony
desperately
round
the
ring
the
girl
standing
and
shrieking
encouragement
the
pony
racing
the
boy
scudding
in
front
until
he
suddenly
turned
and
bolted
out
of
the
ring
the
pony
following
at
his
heels
but
never
quite
catching
him
so
that
the
boy
really
won
after
all
which
norah
thought
was
quite
as
it
should
be
then
there
were
the
acrobats
accomplished
men
in
tight
clothes
who
cut
the
most
amazing
somersaults
and
seemed
to
regard
no
object
as
too
great
to
be
leaped
over
they
brought
in
the
horses
and
stood
ever
so
many
of
them
together
backed
up
by
the
elephant
and
the
leading
acrobat
jumped
over
them
all
without
any
apparent
effort
after
which
all
the
horses
galloped
off
of
their
own
accord
and
put
themselves
away
without
giving
anyone
any
trouble
then
the
acrobats
were
hauled
up
into
the
top
of
the
tent
where
they
swung
themselves
from
rope
to
rope
and
somersaulted
through
space
and
one
man
hung
head
downwards
and
caught
by
the
hands
another
who
came
flying
through
the
air
as
if
he
belonged
there
once
he
missed
the
outstretched
hands
and
norah
gasped
expecting
to
see
him
terribly
hurt
instead
of
which
he
fell
harmlessly
into
a
big
net
thoughtfully
spread
for
his
reception
and
rebounded
like
a
tennis
ball
kissing
his
hand
gracefully
to
the
audience
after
which
he
again
whirled
through
the
air
and
this
time
landed
safely
in
the
hands
of
the
hanging
man
who
had
all
this
while
seemed
just
as
comfortable
head
downwards
as
any
other
way
there
was
even
a
little
boy
who
swung
himself
about
the
tent
as
fearlessly
as
the
grown
men
and
cut
capers
almost
as
dangerous
as
theirs
norah
could
help
breathing
more
freely
when
the
acrobats
bowed
their
final
farewell
linton
consulted
his
programme
they
bringing
in
the
lion
next
he
said
the
band
struck
up
the
liveliest
of
tunes
all
the
ring
was
cleared
now
except
for
the
clown
who
suddenly
assumed
an
appearance
of
great
solemnity
he
marched
to
the
edge
of
the
ring
and
struck
an
attitude
indicative
of
profound
respect
in
came
the
elephant
lightly
harnessed
and
drawing
a
huge
cage
on
wheels
on
other
sides
marched
attendants
in
special
uniforms
and
on
the
elephant
back
stood
the
lion
tamer
all
glorious
in
scarlet
and
gold
so
that
he
was
almost
hurtful
to
the
eye
in
the
cage
three
lions
paced
ceaselessly
up
and
down
the
band
blared
the
people
clapped
the
clown
bowed
his
forehead
into
the
dust
and
said
feelingly
wow
beside
the
ring
was
another
more
like
a
huge
iron
safe
than
a
ring
as
it
was
completely
walled
and
roofed
with
iron
bars
the
cage
was
drawn
up
close
beside
this
and
the
doors
slid
back
the
lions
needed
no
further
invitation
they
gave
smothered
growls
as
they
leaped
from
their
close
quarters
into
this
larger
breathing
space
then
another
door
was
opened
stealthily
and
the
lion
tamer
slipped
in
armed
with
no
weapon
more
deadly
than
a
heavy
whip
norah
did
not
like
it
it
seemed
to
her
to
put
it
mildly
a
risky
proceeding
generally
speaking
norah
was
by
no
means
a
careful
soul
and
had
no
opinion
of
people
who
thought
over
much
about
looking
after
their
skins
but
this
business
of
lions
was
not
exactly
what
she
had
been
used
to
they
appeared
to
her
so
hungry
and
so
remarkably
ill
tempered
and
the
man
was
as
one
to
three
and
had
apparently
no
advantage
in
the
matter
of
teeth
and
claws
do
like
this
game
said
the
bush
maiden
frowning
is
he
safe
daddy
oh
he
all
right
her
father
answered
smiling
these
chaps
know
how
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
the
lions
know
he
master
watch
them
norah
was
already
doing
that
the
lions
prowling
round
the
ring
keeping
wary
eyes
on
their
tamer
were
called
to
duty
by
a
sharp
crack
of
the
whip
growling
they
took
their
respective
stations
two
on
the
seats
of
chairs
the
third
standing
between
them
poised
on
the
two
chair
backs
then
they
were
put
through
a
quick
succession
of
tricks
they
jumped
over
chairs
and
ropes
and
each
other
they
raced
round
the
ring
taking
hurdles
at
intervals
they
balanced
on
big
wooden
balls
and
pushed
them
along
by
quick
changes
of
position
then
they
leaped
through
hoops
ornamented
with
fluttering
strips
of
paper
and
clearly
did
not
care
for
the
exercise
and
all
the
while
their
stealthy
eyes
never
left
those
of
the
tamer
how
do
you
like
it
asked
linton
it
beastly
said
norah
with
surprising
suddenness
i
hate
it
daddy
such
big
beautiful
things
and
to
make
them
do
silly
tricks
like
these
just
as
you
train
a
kitten
well
they
nothing
more
than
big
cats
laughed
her
father
i
do
care
it
it
mean
i
think
i
do
wonder
they
cross
and
you
can
see
they
are
daddy
if
i
was
a
lion
i
know
i
want
to
bite
somebody
the
lions
certainly
did
seem
cross
they
growled
constantly
and
were
slow
to
obey
orders
the
whip
was
always
cracking
and
once
or
twice
a
big
lioness
who
was
especially
sulky
received
a
sharp
cut
the
outside
attendants
kept
close
to
the
cage
armed
with
long
iron
bars
norah
thought
watching
them
that
they
were
somewhat
uneasy
for
herself
she
knew
she
would
be
very
glad
when
the
lion
turn
was
over
the
smaller
tricks
were
finished
and
the
tamer
made
ready
for
the
grand
chariot
he
dragged
forward
an
iron
chariot
and
to
it
harnessed
the
smaller
lions
with
stout
straps
coupling
the
reins
to
a
hook
on
the
front
of
the
little
vehicle
then
he
signalled
to
the
lioness
to
take
her
place
as
driver
the
lioness
did
not
move
she
crouched
down
watching
him
with
hungry
savage
eyes
the
trainer
took
a
step
forward
raising
his
whip
you
queen
he
said
sharply
she
growled
not
stirring
a
sudden
movement
of
the
lions
behind
him
made
the
trainer
glance
round
quickly
there
was
a
roar
and
a
yellow
streak
cleft
the
air
a
child
voice
screamed
the
tamer
spring
aside
was
too
late
he
went
down
on
his
face
the
lioness
upon
him
norah
cry
rang
out
over
the
circus
just
as
the
lioness
sprang
too
late
for
the
trainer
however
the
girl
was
on
her
feet
clutching
her
father
oh
daddy
daddy
she
said
all
was
wildest
confusion
men
were
shouting
women
screaming
two
girls
fainted
slipping
down
motionless
unnoticed
heaps
from
their
seats
circus
men
yelled
contradictory
orders
within
the
ring
the
lioness
crouched
over
the
fallen
man
her
angry
eyes
roving
about
the
disordered
tent
the
two
lions
in
the
chariot
were
making
furious
attempts
to
break
away
luckily
their
harness
was
strong
and
they
were
so
close
to
the
edge
of
the
ring
that
the
attendants
were
able
with
their
iron
bars
to
keep
them
in
check
after
a
few
blows
they
settled
down
growling
but
subdued
but
to
rescue
the
trainer
was
not
so
easy
a
matter
he
lay
in
the
very
centre
of
the
ring
beyond
the
reach
of
any
weapons
and
not
a
man
would
venture
within
the
great
cage
the
attendants
shouted
at
the
lioness
brandished
irons
cracked
whips
she
heard
them
unmoved
once
she
shifted
her
position
slightly
and
a
moan
came
from
the
man
underneath
this
is
awful
linton
said
he
left
his
seat
in
the
front
row
and
went
across
the
ring
to
the
group
of
men
ca
you
shoot
the
brute
he
asked
we
do
it
in
a
minute
the
proprietor
answered
but
who
shoot
and
take
the
chance
of
hitting
joe
look
at
the
way
they
are
it
ten
to
one
he
get
he
shook
his
head
well
i
guess
it
up
to
me
to
go
in
and
tackle
her
i
get
a
better
shot
inside
the
he
moved
forward
a
woman
flung
herself
upon
him
and
clung
to
him
desperately
norah
hardly
recognised
her
as
the
gay
lady
who
had
so
merrily
jumped
through
the
burning
hoops
a
little
while
ago
you
sha
go
dave
she
cried
sobbing
you
must
think
of
the
kiddies
joe
has
got
a
wife
and
little
the
circus
proprietor
tried
to
loosen
her
hold
i
got
to
my
girl
he
said
gently
i
ca
leave
a
man
o
mine
to
that
brute
it
my
fault
i
orter
known
better
than
to
let
him
take
her
from
them
cubs
let
go
he
tried
to
unclinch
her
hands
from
his
coat
has
she
the
lioness
got
little
cubs
it
was
norah
voice
and
linton
started
to
find
her
at
his
side
norah
very
pale
and
shaky
with
wide
eyes
glowing
with
a
great
idea
the
circus
man
nodded
would
she
norah
voice
was
trembling
almost
beyond
the
power
of
speech
would
she
go
to
them
if
you
showed
them
to
her
put
them
in
the
small
cage
my
old
cat
would
by
the
powers
said
the
proprietor
fetch
dick
the
clown
ran
his
grotesque
draperies
contrasting
oddly
enough
with
his
errand
in
an
instant
he
was
back
two
fluffy
yellow
heaps
in
his
arms
one
whined
as
they
drew
near
the
cage
and
the
lioness
looked
up
sharply
with
a
growl
the
clown
held
the
cubs
in
her
view
and
she
growled
again
evidently
uneasy
beneath
her
the
man
was
quiet
now
the
cage
quick
the
big
lion
cage
its
open
door
communicating
with
the
ring
stood
ready
the
clown
opened
another
door
and
slipped
in
the
protesting
cubs
they
made
for
the
further
door
but
were
checked
by
the
stout
cords
fastened
to
their
collars
he
held
them
in
leash
in
full
view
of
the
lioness
she
growled
and
moved
but
did
not
leave
her
prey
make
sing
out
the
woman
said
sharply
someone
handed
the
clown
an
iron
rod
sharpened
at
one
end
he
passed
it
through
the
bars
and
prodded
a
cub
on
the
foot
it
whined
angrily
and
a
quick
growl
came
from
the
ring
harder
dick
the
clown
obeyed
there
was
a
sharp
amazed
yelp
of
pain
from
the
cub
and
an
answering
roar
from
the
mother
another
protesting
cry
and
then
again
that
yellow
streak
as
the
lioness
left
her
prey
and
sprang
to
her
baby
with
a
deafening
roar
the
clown
tugged
the
cubs
sharply
back
into
the
recesses
of
the
cage
as
the
mother
hurled
herself
through
the
narrow
opening
behind
her
the
bars
rattled
into
place
and
she
was
restored
to
captivity
it
was
the
work
of
only
a
moment
to
rush
into
the
ring
where
the
tamer
lay
huddled
and
motionless
kind
hands
lifted
him
and
carried
him
away
beyond
the
performance
tent
with
its
eager
spectators
the
attendants
quickly
unharnessed
the
two
tame
lions
and
they
were
removed
in
another
cage
brought
in
by
the
elephant
for
their
benefit
norah
slipped
a
hot
trembling
hand
into
her
father
let
go
daddy
i
had
more
than
enough
i
think
said
linton
come
on
little
they
slipped
out
in
the
wake
of
the
anxious
procession
that
carried
the
tamer
as
they
went
a
performing
goat
and
monkey
passed
them
on
their
way
to
the
ring
and
the
clown
capered
behind
them
they
heard
his
cheerful
shout
here
we
are
again
and
the
laughter
of
the
crowd
as
the
show
was
resumed
plucky
chap
that
clown
linton
said
in
the
fresh
air
the
men
had
laid
the
tamer
down
gently
and
a
doctor
was
bending
over
him
examining
him
by
the
flickering
light
of
torches
held
by
hands
that
found
it
hard
to
be
steady
not
so
much
damaged
as
he
might
be
the
doctor
announced
rising
that
shoulder
will
take
a
bit
of
healing
but
he
looks
healthy
his
padded
uniform
has
saved
his
life
let
get
him
to
the
private
hospital
up
the
street
everything
necessary
is
there
and
i
like
to
have
his
shoulder
dressed
before
he
regains
the
men
lifted
the
improvised
stretcher
again
and
passed
on
with
it
norah
and
her
father
were
following
when
a
voice
called
them
the
wife
of
the
circus
proprietor
ran
after
them
a
strange
figure
enough
in
her
scarlet
riding
dress
the
paint
on
her
face
streaked
with
tear
marks
i
like
to
know
who
you
are
she
said
catching
norah
hand
but
for
you
my
man
been
in
the
ring
with
that
brute
none
of
us
had
the
sense
to
think
o
bringin
in
the
cubs
tell
me
your
name
norah
told
her
unwillingly
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
over
she
added
in
great
confusion
i
guess
you
saved
joe
life
an
perhaps
my
dave
as
well
the
woman
said
we
wo
forget
you
good
night
sir
an
thank
you
norah
had
no
wish
to
be
thanked
being
of
opinion
that
she
had
done
less
than
nothing
at
all
she
was
feeling
rather
sick
and
amazing
feeling
for
norah
inclined
to
cry
she
was
very
glad
to
get
into
bed
at
the
hotel
and
eagerly
welcomed
her
father
suggestion
that
he
should
sit
for
a
while
in
her
room
norah
did
not
know
that
it
was
dawn
before
linton
left
his
watch
by
the
restless
sleeper
quiet
now
and
sought
his
own
couch
she
woke
late
from
a
dream
of
lions
and
elephants
and
men
who
moaned
softly
her
father
was
by
her
bedside
breakfast
lazy
bones
he
said
how
the
tamer
queried
norah
sitting
up
getting
on
all
right
he
wants
to
see
me
said
norah
whatever
for
we
got
to
find
that
out
said
her
father
withdrawing
they
found
out
after
breakfast
when
a
grateful
man
swathed
in
bandages
stammered

the
nurse

his
nod

a
young
tiger
beautifully
marked
and
made
into
a
rug
if
you

the
tamer
like
to
feel

i
like
to
shake

outside
the
room
norah
turned
a
flushed
face
to
her
father
do
let
go
home
daddy
she
begged
cunjee
too
embarrassing
for
me
chapter
xiv
camping
out
about
that
fishing
excursion
norah
yes
a
small
brown
paw
slid
itself
into
linton
hand
they
were
sitting
on
the
verandah
in
the
stillness
of
an
autumn
evening
watching
the
shadows
on
the
lawn
become
vague
and
indistinct
and
finally
merge
into
one
haze
of
dusk
linton
had
been
silent
for
a
long
time
norah
always
knew
when
her
father
wanted
to
talk
this
evening
she
was
content
to
be
silent
too
leaning
against
his
knee
in
her
own
friendly
fashion
as
she
curled
up
at
his
feet
oh
you
had
forgotten
then
well
not
much
only
i
did
know
if
you
really
wanted
to
go
why
yes
said
her
father
i
think
it
would
be
rather
a
good
idea
my
girlie
there
not
much
doing
on
the
place
just
now
i
could
easily
be
spared
and
we
do
want
to
leave
our
trip
until
the
days
grow
shorter
the
moon
will
be
right
too
it
will
be
full
in
four
or
five
days
i
forget
the
exact
date
so
altogether
norah
i
think
we
better
consult
brownie
about
the
commissariat
department
and
make
our
arrangements
to
go
it
be
simply
lovely
said
his
daughter
breathing
a
long
sigh
of
delight
such
a
long
time
since
we
had
a
camping
out
just
you
and
me
yes
it
a
good
while
well
we
got
to
make
up
for
lost
time
by
catching
plenty
of
fish
said
linton
i
hope
you
forgotten
the
whereabouts
of
that
fine
new
hole
of
yours
you
have
to
take
me
to
it
if
anglers
bend
does
come
up
to
a
deep
flush
came
into
norah
face
for
a
little
while
she
had
almost
forgotten
the
hermit
or
rather
he
had
ceased
to
occupy
a
prominent
position
in
her
mind
since
the
talk
of
the
winfield
murder
had
begun
to
die
away
the
troopers
unsuccessful
in
their
quest
had
gone
back
to
headquarters
and
norah
had
breathed
more
freely
knowing
that
her
friend
had
escaped
this
time
still
she
never
felt
comfortable
in
her
mind
about
him
never
before
had
she
kept
any
secret
from
her
father
and
the
fact
of
this
concealment
was
apt
to
come
home
closely
to
her
at
times
and
cloud
the
perfect
friendship
between
them
master
billy
will
be
delighted
i
expect
went
on
linton
not
noticing
the
little
girl
silence
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
groove
of
civilisation
is
a
joy
to
that
primitive
young
man
i
do
fancy
it
would
take
much
to
make
a
cheerful
savage
of
ca
you
fancy
him
said
norah
making
an
effort
to
break
away
from
her
own
thoughts
roaming
the
bush
with
a
boomerang
and
a
waddy
and
dressed
in
strips
of
white
striped
indeed
said
her
father
laughing
i
no
doubt
he
enjoy
it
i
hope
his
ancient
instincts
wo
revive
he
the
best
hand
with
horses
we
ever
had
on
the
station
now
norah
come
and
talk
to
brown
on
being
consulted
saw
no
difficulties
in
the
way
a
day
she
declared
was
all
she
wanted
to
prepare
sufficient
food
for
the
party
for
a
week
let
alone
for
only
three
days
not
as
i
stint
you
to
three
days
remarked
the
prudent
brownie
last
time
it
was
to
be
three
days
an
was
more
like
six
when
we
saw
you
again
once
you
two
gets
away
and
she
wagged
a
stern
forefinger
at
her
employer
and
there
that
black
himp
he
eats
enough
for
five
you
forget
the
fish
we
going
to
live
on
laughed
linton
said
brownie
solemnly
first
catch
your
fish
why
of
course
we
mean
to
you
horrid
old
thing
cried
norah
laughing
and
bring
you
home
loads
too
not
that
you
deserve
it
for
doubting
us
i
have
seen
many
fishing
parties
go
out
miss
norah
my
dear
said
brown
impassively
and
on
the
more
came
hempty
than
bringing
loads
fish
bein
curious
things
an
very
unreliable
on
the
bite
still
we
for
the
best
an
meanwhile
to
prepare
for
the
worst
i
just
cook
a
few
extry
little
things
another
tongue
now
an
a
nice
piece
of
corned
beef
an
a
an
do
you
think
you
could
manage
a
pie
or
two
miss
norah
try
her
said
linton
laughing
let
tell
billy
and
off
went
norah
at
a
gallop
she
returned
a
few
minutes
later
slightly
crestfallen
billy
must
be
asleep
she
said
i
could
get
an
answer
lazy
young
nigger
and
it
still
twilight
billy
has
no
use
for
the
day
after
the
sun
goes
down
unless
he
going
her
father
said
never
mind
the
news
will
keep
until
the
oh
i
know
said
norah
smiling
but
i
wanted
to
tell
him
i
sympathise
with
you
said
her
father
and
meanwhile
to
console
yourself
suppose
you
bend
your
mighty
mind
to
the
problem
of
getting
away
do
you
see
any
objection
to
our
leaving
for
parts
unknown
the
day
after
depends
on
brownie
and
the
tucker
said
norah
practically
that
part
all
right
brownie
guarantees
to
have
everything
ready
night
if
you
help
why
of
course
i
will
and
you
have
to
get
your
own
preparations
that
wo
take
long
said
norah
with
a
grin
brush
comb
pyjamas
that
all
dad
such
minor
things
as
soap
and
towels
do
appear
to
enter
into
your
calculations
said
her
father
well
i
can
bear
it
oh
you
silly
old
dad
of
course
i
know
about
those
only
brownie
always
packs
the
ordinary
uninteresting
i
foresee
a
busy
day
for
you
and
brownie
tomorrow
linton
said
i
have
a
laborious
time
myself
fixing
up
fishing
tackle
if
jim
and
his
merry
men
left
me
with
any
as
for
billy
he
will
spend
the
day
grubbing
for
bait
wherefore
everything
being
settled
come
and
play
me
last
rose
of
summer
and
then
say
norah
was
up
early
and
the
day
passed
swiftly
in
a
whirl
of
preparations
everything
was
ready
by
evening
including
a
hamper
of
monumental
proportions
the
consumption
of
which
linton
said
would
certainly
render
the
party
unfit
for
active
exertion
in
the
way
of
fishing
billy
delight
had
made
itself
manifest
in
the
broad
grin
which
he
wore
all
day
while
he
dug
for
worms
and
chased
crickets
and
the
horses
were
brought
in
and
stabled
overnight
so
that
an
early
start
might
be
made
it
was
quite
an
exciting
day
and
norah
was
positive
that
she
could
not
go
to
sleep
when
her
father
sent
her
off
to
bed
at
an
unusually
early
hour
meeting
her
remonstrances
with
the
reminder
that
she
had
to
be
up
with
or
before
the
lark
however
she
was
really
tired
and
was
soon
asleep
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
only
been
in
this
blissful
condition
for
three
minutes
when
a
hand
was
laid
on
her
shoulder
and
she
started
up
to
find
daylight
had
come
linton
stood
laughing
at
her
sleepy
face
mean
to
say
it
morning
said
norah
i
been
led
to
believe
so
her
father
rejoined
shall
i
pull
you
out
or
would
you
prefer
to
rise
without
assistance
i
much
prefer
to
go
to
sleep
again
but
i
tumble
out
thank
you
said
his
daughter
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
had
your
bath
daddy
just
going
to
then
i
race
you
said
norah
snatching
a
towel
and
disappearing
down
the
hall
a
slender
flying
figure
in
blue
pyjamas
linton
gave
chase
but
norah
start
was
too
good
and
the
click
of
the
lock
greeted
him
as
he
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
bathroom
the
noise
of
the
shower
drowned
his
laughing
threats
while
a
small
voice
sang
amid
splashes
you
should
have
been
here
last
week
breakfast
was
a
merry
meal
although
as
norah
said
it
was
unreasonable
to
expect
anybody
to
have
an
appetite
at
that
hour
still
with
a
view
to
the
future
and
to
avoid
wounding
brown
too
deeply
they
made
as
firm
an
attempt
as
possible
with
surprisingly
good
results
then
brief
were
said
the
pack
scientifically
adjusted
to
the
saddle
on
the
old
mare
and
they
rode
off
in
the
cool
dewy
morning
this
time
there
was
no
racing
and
chasing
cannobie
lea
on
the
way
to
anglers
bend
linton
days
of
scurrying
were
over
he
said
unless
a
bullock
happened
to
have
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
way
he
should
go
and
as
racing
by
one
self
is
a
poor
thing
norah
was
content
to
ride
along
steadily
by
her
father
side
with
only
an
occasional
canter
when
bobs
pulled
and
reefed
as
if
he
were
as
anxious
to
gallop
as
his
young
mistress
could
possibly
be
it
was
time
for
lunch
when
they
at
length
arrived
at
the
bend
on
the
creek
the
horses
were
unsaddled
and
hobbled
and
then
turned
out
to
wander
at
their
own
sweet
will
the
shortness
of
the
hobbles
a
guarantee
that
they
would
not
stray
very
far
and
the
three
wanderers
sat
on
the
bank
of
the
creek
very
ready
for
the
luncheon
brown
had
carefully
prepared
and
placed
near
the
top
of
the
pack
this
despatched
preparations
were
made
for
pitching
camp
here
luck
favoured
them
for
a
visit
to
their
former
camping
place
showed
that
tent
poles
and
pegs
were
still
there
and
uninjured
which
considerably
lessened
the
labour
of
pitching
the
tents
in
a
very
short
time
the
two
tents
were
standing
and
a
couple
of
stretchers
rigged
up
with
bags
linton
had
no
opinion
of
the
comfort
of
sleeping
on
beds
of
leaves
while
her
father
and
billy
were
at
this
work
norah
unpacked
the
cooking
utensils
and
provisions
most
of
the
latter
were
encased
in
calico
bags
which
could
be
hung
in
the
shade
secure
from
either
ants
or
flies
the
remainder
packed
in
tins
being
stowed
away
easily
in
the
corner
of
one
of
the
tents
when
the
stretchers
were
ready
norah
unpacked
the
bedding
and
made
their
beds
finally
she
hung
the
to
the
ridge
poles
and
said
contentedly
daddy
it
just
like
home
glad
you
think
so
said
linton
casting
an
approving
eye
over
the
camp
and
really
there
is
something
wonderfully
homelike
about
a
camp
with
a
few
arrangements
for
comfort
at
any
rate
i
think
we
manage
very
well
for
a
few
days
norah
now
while
billy
lays
in
a
stock
of
firewood
and
fixes
up
a
for
himself
to
sleep
in
suppose
you
and
i
go
down
and
try
to
catch
some
fish
for
tea
plenty
laughed
norah
it
soon
became
evident
that
anglers
bend
was
going
to
maintain
its
name
as
a
place
for
fish
scarcely
was
norah
line
in
the
water
before
a
big
blackfish
was
on
the
hook
and
after
that
the
fun
was
fast
and
furious
until
they
had
caught
enough
for
two
or
three
meals
the
day
was
ideal
for
fishing
grey
and
warm
with
just
enough
breeze
to
ripple
the
water
faintly
linton
and
norah
found
it
very
peaceful
sitting
together
on
the
old
log
that
jutted
across
the
stream
and
the
time
passed
quickly
billy
at
length
appeared
and
was
given
the
fish
to
prepare
and
then
father
and
daughter
returned
to
camp
linton
lit
the
fire
and
cutting
two
stout
forked
stakes
which
he
drove
into
the
ground
one
on
each
side
of
the
fire
he
hung
a
green
pole
across
in
readiness
to
hold
the
billy
and
billy
presently
came
up
with
the
fish
and
soon
a
cheery
sound
of
sizzling
smote
the
evening
air
by
the
time
that
norah
had
the
table
set
as
she
phrased
it
the
fish
were
ready
and
in
norah
opinion
no
meal
ever
tasted
half
so
good
after
it
was
over
billy
the
indispensable
removed
the
plates
and
washed
up
and
norah
and
her
father
sat
by
the
fire
and
yarned
in
the
cool
dusk
not
for
long
for
soon
the
little
girl
began
to
feel
sleepy
after
the
full
day
in
the
open
air
and
the
prospect
of
the
comfortable
stretcher
in
her
tent
was
very
tempting
she
brushed
her
hair
outside
in
the
moonlight
because
a
small
tent
is
not
the
place
in
which
to
wield
a
hairbrush
then
she
slipped
into
bed
and
her
father
came
and
tucked
her
up
before
tying
the
flap
securely
enough
to
keep
out
possible
intruders
in
the
shape
of
bears
and
norah
lay
watching
the
flickering
firelight
for
a
little
while
thinking
there
was
nothing
so
glorious
as
the
feeling
and
the
night
scents
of
the
bush
then
she
fell
asleep
a
cheeky
jackass
on
a
gum
tree
bough
fairly
roared
with
laughter
and
norah
woke
up
with
a
violent
start
the
sunlight
was
streaming
across
her
bed
for
a
moment
she
was
puzzled
wondering
where
she
was
then
the
walls
of
the
tent
caught
her
eye
and
she
laughed
at
herself
and
then
lay
still
in
the
very
pleasure
of
the
dewy
morning
and
the
wonderful
freshness
of
the
air
for
there
is
a
delight
in
awaking
after
a
night
in
the
open
that
the
finest
house
in
the
world
can
not
give
presently
the
flap
of
the
tent
was
parted
and
linton
peeped
in
hallo
he
said
smiling
did
the
old
jackass
wake
you
i
found
him
as
good
as
an
alarum
clock
myself
how
about
a
swim
oh
rather
said
norah
tumbling
out
of
bed
she
slipped
on
a
jacket
and
shoes
and
presently
joined
her
father
and
they
threaded
their
way
through
the
scrub
until
they
came
to
a
part
of
the
creek
where
a
beach
flat
and
sandy
and
shelving
down
to
a
fairly
deep
hole
offered
glorious
bathing
linton
left
norah
here
and
himself
went
a
few
yards
farther
up
round
a
bend
in
the
creek
at
the
first
plunge
the
water
was
distinctly
cold
but
once
the
first
dip
was
taken
norah
forgot
all
about
chilliness
and
only
revelled
in
the
delights
of
that
big
pool
she
could
swim
like
a
fish
her
father
had
seen
to
that
in
the
big
lagoon
at
home
not
until
warning
voice
sang
out
that
it
was
time
to
dress
did
she
leave
the
water
and
then
with
reluctance
a
brisk
rub
down
with
a
hard
towel
and
she
rejoined
her
father
he
cast
an
approving
look
at
her
glowing
face
well
you
look
as
if
you
enjoyed
your
swim
he
said
oh
it
was
lovely
daddy
did
you
have
a
good
bathe
yes
i
struck
a
very
good
place
deep
enough
to
dive
in
her
father
answered
not
that
i
counsel
diving
altogether
you
strike
such
a
lot
of
mud
at
the
bottom
soft
sticky
black
mud
i
spent
most
of
my
bathe
in
getting
myself
clean
after
my
dive
still
i
had
a
good
swim
notwithstanding
i
say
norah
i
ready
for
so
am
i
said
his
daughter
i
hope
billy
got
the
fish
on
however
there
was
no
sign
of
the
black
retainer
when
they
reached
the
camp
the
fire
was
blazing
and
the
billy
boiling
but
of
the
other
billy
no
trace
existed
he
gone
after
the
horses
linton
said
i
told
him
to
see
to
them
but
he
ought
to
be
back
i
hope
they
all
right
well
you
get
dressed
by
the
time
norah
toilet
was
completed
the
fish
under
supervision
were
in
the
pan
and
she
hurried
to
set
out
the
breakfast
things
they
were
just
beginning
breakfast
when
the
sound
of
hoofs
was
heard
and
billy
rode
into
the
clearing
on
his
own
pony
with
evident
signs
of
perturbation
on
his
ebony
face
what
up
billy
linton
asked
sharply
that
feller
billy
said
briefly
broken
hobbles
clear
out
plenty
he
produced
a
hobble
as
he
spoke
the
broken
leather
telling
its
own
tale
linton
uttered
an
exclamation
of
anger
that
comes
of
not
seeing
to
the
hobbles
myself
he
said
sharply
no
sign
of
her
billy
shook
his
head
not
likely
linton
said
that
old
mare
would
make
for
home
like
a
shot
i
dare
say
she
there
by
now
well
billy
there
only
one
thing
to
do
get
your
pony
saddled
and
go
after
billy
face
expressed
unuttered
depths
of
woe
get
your
breakfast
first
said
his
master
there
no
particular
hurry
for
you
bound
to
have
to
go
all
the
way
home
and
bring
some
good
hobbles
back
with
you
if
you
do
billy
slid
to
the
ground
plenty
he
said
ruefully
billy
a
black
vision
of
despondency
had
faded
away
into
the
distance
making
his
chestnut
pony
pay
for
the
disappointment
of
his
long
ride
back
to
the
homestead
for
the
missing
mare
norah
and
her
father
had
cleaned
up
house
as
norah
put
it
and
again
they
were
sitting
on
the
old
log
that
spanned
the
creek
their
lines
were
in
water
but
the
fish
were
shy
the
promise
of
a
hot
day
had
driven
them
to
the
shady
hollows
under
the
banks
the
juiciest
worms
failed
to
lure
them
from
their
norah
thought
it
dull
and
said
so
her
father
laughed
you
never
make
a
fisherman
without
cultivating
an
extra
stock
of
patience
he
said
the
thought
of
last
night
luck
ought
to
make
you
well
it
does
his
daughter
answered
decidedly
that
was
yesterday
and
this
is
and
it
is
dull
daddy
well
keep
on
hoping
said
linton
luck
may
change
at
any
minute
norah
do
you
know
i
have
something
to
tell
you
what
norah
dullness
was
gone
there
was
something
unusual
in
her
father
tone
i
afraid
you
wo
think
it
the
best
news
he
said
smiling
at
her
eager
face
but
it
had
to
come
some
day
i
suppose
i
could
keep
you
a
baby
always
there
a
tutor
coming
to
make
a
learned
lady
of
my
little
bush
daddy
there
were
worlds
of
horror
in
the
tone
oh
do
said
her
father
you
make
me
feel
a
criminal
of
the
deepest
dye
what
can
i
do
with
you
you
ignorant
small
child
i
let
you
grow
up
altogether
a
bush
duffer
his
voice
was
almost
apologetic
i
can
assure
you
it
might
have
been
worse
your
aunt
eva
has
been
harrowing
my
very
soul
to
make
me
send
you
to
a
boarding
school
think
of
that
now
boarding
school
said
norah
faintly
daddy
you
would
no
not
at
present
certainly
said
her
father
but
i
had
to
agree
to
something
and
really
i
knew
it
was
time
you
twelve
you
know
norah
be
oh
all
right
said
norah
swallowing
her
disgust
if
you
say
got
to
be
it
has
to
be
that
all
daddy
my
goodness
how
i
will
hate
it
have
i
got
to
learn
heaps
of
things
loads
said
her
father
nodding
latin
and
french
and
drawing
and
geography
and
how
to
talk
grammar
and
any
number
of
things
i
never
knew
then
you
can
teach
the
tutor
things
riding
and
cooking
and
knitting
and
the
care
of
tame
wallabies
and
any
number
of
things
he
never
dreamed
of
he
a
town
young
man
norah
and
horribly
ignorant
of
all
useful
i
turn
him
over
to
billy
after
school
said
norah
laughing
is
he
nice
dad
very
i
should
say
rejoined
her
father
he
the
son
of
an
old
friend
and
his
face
saddened
imperceptibly
your
aunt
eva
said
it
ought
to
be
a
governess
and
perhaps
it
would
have
been
one
only
young
stephenson
came
in
my
way
he
wanted
something
to
do
and
for
his
father
sake
i
chose
him
for
my
daughter
who
his
father
daddy
well
you
would
know
if
i
told
you
girlie
a
dear
old
friend
of
mine
when
i
was
a
young
man
the
best
friend
i
ever
had
jim
is
named
after
is
he
dead
now
linton
hesitated
we
lost
him
years
ago
he
said
sadly
a
great
trouble
came
upon
him
he
lost
some
money
and
was
falsely
accused
of
dishonesty
and
he
had
to
go
to
prison
when
he
came
out
his
wife
refused
to
see
him
they
had
made
her
believe
him
a
thief
and
she
was
a
hard
woman
although
she
loved
him
she
sent
him
a
message
that
he
must
never
try
to
see
her
or
their
she
was
norah
eyes
were
angry
she
was
very
unhappy
so
we
must
judge
her
her
father
said
sighing
poor
soul
she
paid
for
her
harshness
later
the
truth
of
the
whole
bad
business
came
out
and
she
would
have
given
the
world
to
be
able
to
beg
his
it
was
too
was
he
dead
daddy
they
found
his
body
in
the
river
said
linton
poor
old
chap
he
could
stand
the
loss
of
his
whole
world
i
wished
ever
since
that
i
could
tell
him
i
never
believed
the
lie
for
a
moment
i
was
in
england
at
the
time
and
i
knew
nothing
about
it
until
he
was
poor
old
daddy
said
norah
softly
oh
it
an
old
story
now
linton
said
only
i
never
lose
the
regret
and
wish
that
i
could
have
done
something
to
help
my
old
friend
i
do
quite
know
why
i
told
you
about
it
except
that
i
want
you
to
be
kind
to
young
dick
stephenson
because
his
life
has
been
a
sad
enough
is
his
mother
alive
she
lives
in
melbourne
said
her
father
i
think
she
only
lives
for
this
boy
and
the
time
when
she
can
go
to
her
husband
and
beg
his
forgiveness
he
give
it
too
poor
old
jim
he
could
never
bear
malice
in
his
life
and
i
certain
death
could
change
his
nature
the
lad
seems
a
good
chap
he
had
a
education
but
his
mother
never
gave
him
any
profession
i
do
know
why
women
made
for
business
so
he
wants
to
i
be
good
to
him
norah
slipped
her
hand
into
her
father
that
my
little
girl
i
knew
i
could
depend
on
you
said
linton
a
look
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
pulled
hard
at
his
pipe
norah
guessed
he
was
thinking
of
days
of
long
ago
she
pulled
her
bait
up
and
examination
told
her
it
was
untouched
the
fish
were
certainly
shy
and
another
tempting
did
not
bring
them
to
the
hook
it
was
exceedingly
dull
norah
wound
up
her
line
slowly
she
also
had
been
thinking
i
going
for
a
walk
daddy
she
said
all
right
dear
do
go
far
said
her
father
absently
norah
walked
soberly
along
the
log
until
she
reached
the
creek
bank
and
then
jumped
ashore
she
looked
round
at
her
father
but
he
was
absorbed
in
his
fishing
and
his
thoughts
and
so
the
little
girl
slipped
away
into
the
bush
she
made
her
way
among
the
trees
quickly
keeping
to
the
line
of
the
creek
presently
she
sat
down
on
a
stump
and
thought
deeply
the
hermit
had
been
pretty
constantly
in
norah
mind
since
the
troopers
had
been
scouring
the
district
in
their
search
for
the
winfield
murderer
she
had
longed
intensely
to
warn
him
scenting
certain
unpleasantness
to
him
and
possible
danger
although
she
was
loyally
firm
in
the
belief
that
he
could
not
be
the
man
for
whom
they
were
searching
still
how
like
the
description
was
even
though
faith
was
unshaken
she
knew
that
the
veriest
hint
of
the
existence
would
bring
the
troopers
down
on
him
as
fast
as
they
could
travel
to
his
camp
she
put
aside
resolutely
the
thoughts
that
flocked
to
her
mind
the
strange
old
man
lonely
life
his
desire
to
hide
himself
from
his
i
do
understand
it
a
bit
she
said
aloud
but
i
have
to
tell
him
he
ought
to
with
that
she
sprang
up
and
ran
on
through
the
scrub
it
was
thick
enough
to
puzzle
many
a
traveller
but
the
little
maid
of
the
bush
saw
no
difficulties
in
the
way
it
was
quite
clear
to
her
remembering
how
the
hermit
had
guided
their
merry
party
on
the
first
visit
weeks
ago
at
the
exact
spot
on
the
creek
she
struck
off
at
right
angles
into
the
heart
of
the
trees
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
for
the
tall
old
form
that
might
appear
at
any
moment
hoping
that
her
father
might
not
grow
tired
of
fishing
and
for
her
to
return
but
there
was
silence
in
the
bush
and
no
sign
of
the
hermit
could
be
seen
the
thought
came
to
norah
that
he
might
have
struck
camp
and
gone
farther
back
into
the
wild
country
away
from
the
men
he
dreaded
but
she
put
the
idea
from
her
somehow
she
felt
that
he
was
there
she
came
to
the
clump
of
dogwood
that
hid
the
old
log
along
which
lay
the
last
part
of
the
track
to
the
hermit
camp
and
climbing
up
ran
along
it
lightly
there
were
no
recent
footprints
upon
it
suddenly
the
silence
of
the
surroundings
fell
heavily
on
her
heart
reaching
the
end
of
the
log
that
gave
access
to
the
clearing
she
took
a
hasty
glance
round
the
ashes
of
the
fire
were
long
dead
no
one
was
there
norah
heart
thumped
heavily
for
a
moment
she
fought
with
the
longing
to
run
back
back
from
this
strange
silent
place
back
to
daddy
then
she
gulped
down
something
in
her
throat
and
giving
herself
an
impatient
shake
she
went
resolutely
across
the
clearing
to
the
tent
and
peeped
in
the
interior
of
the
tent
was
as
neat
and
homelike
as
when
norah
had
seen
it
first
the
quaint
bits
of
furniture
stood
in
their
places
and
the
skins
lay
on
the
floor
but
norah
saw
nothing
but
her
friend
face
the
hermit
was
lying
on
his
bunk
a
splendid
old
figure
in
his
dress
of
soft
furry
skins
but
with
a
certain
helplessness
about
him
that
brought
norah
heart
into
her
mouth
as
the
flap
of
the
tent
lifted
he
turned
his
head
with
difficulty
and
looked
at
the
little
girl
with
weary
burning
eyes
that
held
no
light
of
recognition
his
face
was
ghastly
white
beneath
the
sunburnt
skin
which
was
drawn
like
parchment
over
the
cheekbones
a
low
moan
came
from
his
dry
lips
water
norah
cast
a
despairing
glance
around
an
empty
billy
by
the
old
man
told
its
own
tale
and
a
hurried
search
in
the
camp
only
revealed
empty
vessels
i
be
back
in
a
minute
said
norah
sobbing
afterwards
she
could
not
remember
how
she
had
got
down
to
the
creek
her
blouse
was
torn
and
there
were
long
scratches
on
her
wrists
and
she
was
panting
as
she
came
back
to
the
sick
man
and
struggling
to
raise
his
heavy
head
held
a
cup
to
his
lips
he
drank
fiercely
desperately
as
norah
had
seen
starving
cattle
drink
when
released
after
a
long
journey
in
the
trucks
again
and
again
he
drank
until
norah
grew
afraid
and
begged
him
to
lie
down
he
obeyed
her
meekly
and
smiled
a
little
but
there
was
no
comprehension
in
the
fevered
eyes
she
put
her
hand
on
his
forehead
and
started
at
its
burning
heat
oh
what
i
do
with
you
she
said
in
her
perplexity
do
said
the
hermit
with
startling
suddenness
but
i
dead
he
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
very
still
dead
ages
ago
he
muttered
a
second
he
lay
so
and
then
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
where
the
child
he
asked
i
must
go
to
him
let
me
go
i
tell
you
he
tried
to
rise
but
fell
back
weakly
water
he
begged
she
gave
him
water
again
and
then
bathed
his
face
and
hands
using
her
handkerchief
for
a
sponge
he
grew
quieter
and
once
or
twice
norah
thought
he
seemed
to
know
her
but
at
the
end
he
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
motionless
i
be
back
very
soon
she
said
do
please
be
still
dear
hermit
she
bent
over
him
and
kissed
his
forehead
and
he
stirred
and
murmured
a
name
she
could
not
catch
then
he
relapsed
into
unconsciousness
and
norah
turned
and
ran
wildly
into
the
scrub
to
bring
daddy
daddy
who
knew
everything
who
always
understood
there
was
no
other
thought
in
her
mind
now
whatever
the
hermit
might
have
done
he
needed
help
now
most
sorely
and
daddy
was
the
only
one
who
could
give
it
only
the
way
seemed
long
as
she
raced
through
the
trees
seeing
always
that
haggard
face
on
the
rude
bunk
if
only
they
were
in
time
linton
sitting
on
the
log
and
lazily
watching
his
idle
float
started
at
the
voice
that
called
to
him
from
the
bank
and
at
sight
of
the
little
girl
be
leaped
to
his
feet
and
ran
towards
her
norah
what
is
it
she
told
him
clinging
to
him
and
sobbing
tugging
at
him
all
the
time
to
make
him
come
quickly
a
strange
enough
tale
it
seemed
to
linton
of
hermits
and
hidden
camps
and
the
winfield
murderer
and
someone
who
needed
help
but
there
was
that
in
norah
face
and
in
her
unfamiliar
emotion
that
made
him
hurry
through
the
scrub
beside
her
although
he
did
not
understand
what
he
was
to
find
and
was
only
conscious
of
immense
relief
to
know
that
she
herself
was
safe
after
the
moment
of
terror
that
her
first
cry
had
given
him
norah
steadied
herself
with
a
great
effort
as
they
came
to
the
silent
camp
he
there
she
said
pointing
linton
understood
something
then
and
he
went
forward
quickly
the
hermit
was
still
unconscious
his
hollow
eyes
met
them
blankly
as
they
entered
the
tent
oh
he
ill
daddy
will
he
die
but
david
linton
did
not
answer
he
was
staring
at
the
unconscious
face
before
him
and
his
own
was
strangely
white
as
norah
looked
at
him
struck
with
a
sudden
wonder
her
father
fell
on
his
knees
and
caught
the
sick
man
hand
jim
he
said
and
a
sob
choked
his
voice
old
chum
jim
chapter
xv
for
friendship
daddy
at
the
quivering
voice
her
father
lifted
his
head
and
norah
saw
that
his
eyes
were
wet
it
my
dear
old
friend
stephenson
he
said
brokenly
i
told
you
about
him
we
thought
he
was
dead
there
was
the
body
i
understand
but
this
is
he
and
he
alive
thank
god
the
hermit
stirred
and
begged
again
for
water
and
linton
held
him
while
he
drank
his
face
grew
anxious
as
he
felt
the
scorching
heat
of
the
old
man
body
he
so
thirsty
norah
said
tremulously
goodness
knows
when
he
had
a
drink
his
poor
lips
were
all
black
and
cracked
when
i
found
had
he
no
water
near
him
asked
her
father
quickly

this
yes
from
the
creek
norah
nodded

some
more
daddy
the
billy
nearly
when
norah
returned
laden
with
two
cans
her
father
met
her
with
a
very
grave
face
that
my
girl
he
said
taking
the
water
from
her
norah

said
norah
quietly

you
said
her
father
looking
down
at
the
steady
face
that
wo
do
dear
not
across
fifteen
miles
of
lonely
country
i
the
hermit
cried
out
suddenly
and
tried
to
rise
and
linton
had
to
hold
him
down
gently
but
the
struggle
was
a

he
said
my
little
wee
he
kissed
her
twice
now
hurry
bobs
grazing
peacefully
under
a
big
gum
tree
was
startled
by
a
little
figure
staggering
beneath
saddle
and
bridle
in
a
minute
norah
was
on
his
back
and
they
were
galloping
across
the
plain
towards
home
a
young
man
sat
on
the
cap
of
the
stockyard
fence
at
billabong
homestead
swinging
his
legs
listlessly
and
wishing
for
something
to
do
he
blessed
the
impulse
that
had
brought
him
to
the
station
before
his
time
and
wondered
if
things
were
likely
to
be
always
as
dull
unless
my
small
pupil
stirs
things
up
i
do
fancy
this
life
much
he
said
moodily
in
which
he
showed
considerable
impatience
of
judgment
being
but
a
young
man
across
the
long
grey
plain
a
tiny
cloud
gathered
and
the
man
watched
it
lazily
gradually
it
grew
larger
until
it
resolved
itself
into
dust
and
the
dust
into
a
horse
and
rider
someone
coming
he
said
with
faint
interest
by
jove
it
a
girl
she
racing
too
wonder
if
anything
wrong
he
slipped
from
the
fence
and
went
forward
to
open
the
gate
looking
at
the
advancing
pair
a
big
bay
pony
panting
and
dripping
with
sweat
but
with
go
in
him
yet
for
a
final
sprint
and
on
his
back
a
little
girl
flushed
and
excited
with
tired
set
lips
he
expected
her
to
stop
at
the
gate
but
she
flashed
by
him
with
a
glance
and
a
brief
thank
you
galloping
up
to
the
gate
of
the
yard
almost
before
the
pony
stopped
she
was
out
of
the
saddle
and
running
up
the
path
to
the
kitchen
the
man
saw
brown
come
out
and
heard
her
cry
of
surprise
as
she
caught
the
child
to
her
something
up
said
the
stranger
he
followed
at
a
run
in
the
kitchen
norah
was
clinging
to
brown
quivering
with
the
effort
not
to
cry
someone
ill
in
the
bush
said
the
astonished
brownie
patting
her
nurseling
yes

all
the
horses

in
where

note

your
new
governess
stephenson

a
gasp
of
astonishment

dick
stephenson
ungrammatically
holding
out
his
hand

pupil

a
poor
gentleman
near
to
dyin
in
the
scrub

the

say

very
pale

stephenson
she
asked
i
you
be
surprised
he
her
voice
failed
her
do
worry
to
talk
he
said
gently

she
steadied
her
voice
i
must
tell
you
it
it
your
father
dick
stephenson
face
suddenly
darkened
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
stiffly
you
making
a
mistake
my
father
is
he
not
said
norah
he
my
dear
hermit
and
he
out
there
with
typhoid
or
some
beastly
thing
we
found
him
and
dad
knows
him
quite
well
it
really
him
he
never
got
do
you
know
what
you
saying
the
man
face
was
white
but
norah
was
at
an
end
she
buried
her
face
in
kind
bosom
and
burst
into
a
passion
of
crying
the
old
woman
rocked
her
to
and
fro
gently
until
the
sobs
grew
fainter
and
norah
began
to
feel
for
her
handkerchief
then
brown
put
her
into
the
big
cushioned
now
you
must
be
brave
and
tell
us
dearie
she
said
gently
this
is
pretty
wonderful
for
so
norah
with
many
catchings
of
the
breath
told
them
all
about
the
hermit
and
of
her
father
recognition
of
him
saying
only
nothing
of
her
long
and
lonely
ride
before
she
had
finished
billy
was
on
the
road
to
cunjee
flying
for
the
doctor
dick
stephenson
broke
in
on
the
story
how
can
i
get
out
there
he
asked
shortly
i
take
you
norah
said
you
that
out
of
the
no
it
is
i
not
tired
said
norah
quite
unconscious
of
saying
anything
but
the
truth
i
knew
i
have
to
anyhow
because
only
billy
and
i
know
the
way
to
the
hermit
camp
and
he
has
to
fetch
the
doctor
you
tell
wright
to
get
banker
for
you
and
put
my
saddle
on
pony
and
to
look
well
after
bobs
hurry
while
brownie
gets
the
other
things
dick
stephenson
made
no
further
protests
his
brain
awhirl
as
he
raced
to
the
stables
brownie
protested
certainly
but
did
her
small
bidding
the
while
but
it
was
a
very
troubled
old
face
that
looked
long
after
the
man
and
the
little
girl
as
they
started
on
the
long
ride
back
to
the
camp
mile
after
mile
they
swung
across
the
grey
plain
norah
did
not
try
to
talk
she
disdained
the
idea
that
she
was
tired
but
a
vague
feeling
told
her
that
she
must
save
all
her
energies
to
guide
the
way
back
to
the
camp
hidden
in
the
scrub
where
the
hermit
lay
raving
and
her
father
sat
beside
the
lonely
bed
neither
was
her
companion
talkative
he
stared
ahead
as
if
trying
to
pierce
with
his
eyes
the
line
of
timber
that
blurred
across
the
landscape
norah
was
glad
he
did
not
bother
her
with
questions
she
had
told
him
all
she
knew
and
now
he
was
content
to
wait
it
must
be
hard
on
him
all
the
same
thought
norah
looking
at
the
set
young
face
and
sparing
an
instant
to
approve
of
the
easy
seat
in
the
saddle
displayed
by
her
new
to
believe
that
your
father
was
dead
all
these
years
and
then
suddenly
to
find
him
alive
but
how
far
apart
in
every
way
why
you
hardly
know
mused
norah
whether
you
like
him
whether
he
be
glad
to
see
you
not
that
anyone
could
fail
to
like
the
hermit
anyone
with
sense
that
is
mile
after
mile
the
plain
slipped
away
beneath
the
even
beat
of
the
steadily
cantering
hoofs
the
creek
forded
slowly
sank
into
the
distance
behind
them
before
the
line
of
timber
grew
darker
and
more
definite
jim
pony
was
not
far
inferior
to
bobs
in
pace
and
easiness
and
his
swinging
canter
required
no
effort
to
sit
but
a
great
weariness
began
to
steal
over
his
rider
dick
stephenson
glancing
at
her
frequently
saw
the
pallor
creeping
upon
the
brave
little
face
he
pulled
up
we
go
steady
for
a
while
he
said
no
good
knocking
you
up
norah
checked
her
pony
unwillingly
oh
do
you
think
we
ought
to
hurry
she
said
dad
waiting
for
those
medicines
you
got
you
yes
i
know
but
i
do
think
we
gain
much
by
overdoing
if
you
thinking
about
me
norah
said
impatiently
you
need
as
right
as
rain
you
must
think
i
pretty
soft
do
come
on
he
looked
at
her
steadily
dark
shadows
of
weariness
lay
under
the
brave
eyes
that
met
his
why
no
he
said
fact
is
i
a
bit
of
a
new
chum
myself
where
riding
concerned
you
must
be
too
ashamed
of
me
i
think
better
walk
for
a
while
and
you
take
he
poured
something
from
his
flask
into
its
little
silver
cup
and
handed
it
to
norah
their
eyes
met
and
she
read
his
meaning
through
the
kindness
of
the
words
that
cloaked
what
he
felt
above
her
weariness
a
sense
of
comfort
stole
over
norah
she
knew
in
that
look
that
henceforth
they
were
friends
she
gulped
down
the
drink
which
was
hateful
but
presently
sent
a
feeling
of
renewed
strength
through
her
tired
limbs
they
rode
on
in
silence
for
some
time
the
horses
brushing
through
the
long
soft
grass
dick
stephenson
pulled
hard
at
his
pipe
did
did
my
father
know
you
this
morning
he
asked
suddenly
norah
shook
her
head
mournfully
he
did
know
anyone
she
answered
only
asked
for
water
and
said
things
i
could
understand
then
when
dad
came
he
knew
him
at
once
but
the
hermit
did
seem
even
to
know
that
dad
was
did
he
look
very
bad
yes
pretty
bad
said
norah
hating
to
hurt
him
he
was
terribly
flushed
and
oh
his
poor
eyes
were
awful
so
burning
and
sunken
and
oh
let
canter
stephenson
please
this
time
there
was
no
objection
banker
jumped
at
the
quick
touch
of
the
spur
as
stephenson
heel
went
home
side
by
side
they
cantered
steadily
until
norah
pulled
her
pony
in
at
length
at
the
entrance
to
the
timber
where
the
creek
swung
into
anglers
bend
we
nearly
there
she
said
but
to
the
man
watching
in
the
hermit
camp
the
hours
were
long
indeed
the
hermit
was
too
weak
to
struggle
much
there
had
been
a
few
sharp
paroxysms
of
delirium
such
as
norah
had
seen
during
which
david
linton
had
been
forced
to
hold
the
old
man
down
with
unwilling
force
but
the
struggles
soon
brought
their
own
result
of
helpless
weakness
and
the
hermit
subsided
into
restless
unconsciousness
broken
by
feeble
mutterings
of
which
few
coherent
words
could
be
caught
dick
was
frequently
on
the
fevered
lips
once
he
smiled
suddenly
and
linton
bending
down
heard
a
faint
whisper
of
sitting
beside
his
old
friend
in
the
lonely
silence
of
the
bush
he
studied
the
ravages
time
and
sorrow
had
wrought
in
the
features
be
knew
greatly
changed
as
jim
stephenson
was
his
face
lined
and
sunken
and
his
beard
long
and
white
as
snow
it
was
still
to
david
linton
the
friend
of
his
boyhood
come
back
from
the
grave
and
from
his
burden
of
unmerited
disgrace
the
frank
blue
eyes
were
as
brave
as
ever
they
met
his
with
no
light
of
recognition
but
with
their
clear
gaze
undimmed
a
sob
rose
in
the
strong
man
throat
if
he
could
but
see
again
that
welcoming
light
hear
once
more
his
name
on
his
friend
lips
if
he
were
not
too
late
the
hermit
muttered
and
tossed
on
his
narrow
bed
the
watcher
thoughts
fled
to
the
little
messenger
galloping
over
the
long
miles
of
lonely
country
his
motherless
girl
whom
he
had
sent
on
a
mission
that
might
so
easily
spell
disaster
horrible
thoughts
came
into
the
father
mind
he
pictured
bobs
putting
his
hoof
into
a
hidden
falling
norah
lying
white
and
motionless
perhaps
far
from
the
track
that
was
not
the
only
danger
bad
characters
were
to
be
met
with
in
the
bush
and
the
pony
was
valuable
enough
to
tempt
a
desperate
man
such
as
the
winfield
murderer
who
was
roaming
the
district
nobody
knew
where
there
was
a
score
of
possible
risks
to
battle
with
them
a
little
maid
of
twelve
strong
only
in
the
bred
of
the
bush
the
father
looked
at
the
ghastly
face
before
him
and
asked
himself
questions
that
tortured
was
it
right
to
have
let
the
young
life
go
to
save
the
old
one
that
seemed
just
flickering
out
he
put
his
face
in
his
hands
and
groaned
how
long
the
hours
were
he
calculated
feverishly
the
time
it
would
take
the
little
messenger
to
reach
home
if
all
went
well
then
how
long
it
must
be
before
a
man
could
come
out
to
him
at
that
thought
he
realised
for
the
first
time
the
difficulty
norah
had
seen
in
silence
who
should
come
out
to
him
black
billy
must
fetch
the
doctor
and
guide
him
to
the
sick
man
but
no
one
else
save
norah
herself
knew
the
track
to
the
little
camp
hidden
so
cunningly
in
the
scrub
at
that
rate
it
might
be
many
hours
before
he
knew
if
his
child
were
safe
anxiety
for
the
remedies
for
his
friend
was
swallowed
up
in
the
anguish
of
uncertainty
for
norah
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
must
go
to
seek
her
that
he
could
not
wait
he
started
up
but
as
if
alarmed
by
his
sudden
movement
the
hermit
cried
out
and
tried
to
rise
struggling
feebly
with
the
strong
hands
that
were
quick
to
hold
him
back
when
the
struggle
was
over
david
linton
sat
down
again
how
could
he
leave
him
then
across
his
agony
of
uncertainty
came
a
clear
childish
voice
the
tent
flaps
were
parted
and
norah
stood
in
the
entrance
white
and
trembling
but
with
a
glad
smile
of
welcome
on
her
lips
behind
her
a
tall
man
who
trembled
too
david
linton
did
not
see
him
all
the
world
seemed
whirling
round
him
as
he
caught
his
child
in
his
arms
chapter
xvi
fighting
death
you
linton
said
he
had
put
norah
gently
into
the
rough
chair
and
turned
to
dick
stephenson
who
was
standing
by
his
father
his
lips
twitching
they
gripped
hands
silently
you
can
recognise
him
i
know
him
anywhere
the
son
said
poor
old
dad
you
think
i
do
know
the
other
said
hastily
ca
tell
until
anderson
comes
but
i
fancy
it
typhoid
you
brought
the
things
ah
his
eyes
brightened
as
they
fell
on
the
leather
brown
had
sent
and
in
a
moment
he
was
unstrapping
it
with
quick
nervous
the
hermit
stirred
and
gasped
for
water
he
drank
readily
enough
from
the
glass
linton
held
to
his
lips
while
his
son
supported
him
with
strong
young
arms
there
was
not
much
they
could
do
anderson
should
be
here
before
long
linton
said
what
time
did
billy
leave
a
little
after
what
did
he
ride
a
big
that
right
linton
nodded
anderson
would
motor
out
to
billabong
i
expect
and
brown
would
have
the
fresh
horses
ready
they
should
not
be
very
long
with
ordinary
luck
billy
left
about
twelve
did
he
by
jove
norah
must
have
made
great
time
it
was
after
ten
when
she
left
she
and
the
pony
looked
as
if
they
done
and
she
came
back
i
had
realised
it
all
in
the
minute
of
seeing
her
her
father
said
staring
at
stephenson
norah
dear
are
you
quite
knocked
up
he
turned
to
speak
but
broke
off
sharply
norah
was
gone
linton
turned
on
his
heel
without
a
word
and
hurried
out
of
the
tent
with
stephenson
at
his
side
just
for
a
moment
the
hermit
was
forgotten
in
the
sudden
pang
of
anxiety
that
gripped
them
both
in
the
open
they
glanced
round
quickly
and
a
sharp
exclamation
of
dismay
broke
from
the
father
norah
was
lying
in
a
crumpled
heap
under
a
tree
there
was
something
terribly
helpless
in
the
little
quiet
figure
face
downwards
on
the
grass
just
for
a
moment
as
he
fell
on
his
knees
beside
her
david
linton
lost
his
he
called
her
piteously
catching
the
limp
body
to
him
dick
stephenson
hand
fell
on
his
shoulder
she
only
fainted
he
said
huskily
that
all
put
her
down
sir
please
and
linton
still
trembling
laid
the
little
girl
on
the
grass
and
loosened
her
collar
while
the
other
forced
a
few
drops
from
his
flask
between
the
pale
lips
gradually
norah
eyes
flickered
and
opened
and
colour
crept
into
her
cheeks
daddy
she
whispered
do
talk
my
darling
her
father
said
lie
i
all
right
now
norah
said
presently
i
so
sorry
i
frightened
you
daddy
i
could
help
you
should
have
kept
still
dear
said
her
father
why
did
you
go
out
i
felt
rummy
said
his
daughter
inelegantly
a
queer
feeling
i
guessed
i
must
be
going
to
tumble
over
it
did
seem
any
good
making
a
duffer
of
myself
when
you
were
busy
with
the
hermit
so
i
cut
dick
stephenson
turned
sharply
and
without
a
word
strode
back
into
the
tent
norah
turned
with
a
sudden
movement
to
her
father
clinging
to
the
rough
serge
of
his
coat
something
like
a
tear
fell
on
her
upturned
face
as
the
strong
arms
enfolded
her
why
daddy
dear
old
dad
she
whispered
it
was
nearly
twilight
when
anderson
and
black
billy
rode
into
the
clearing
to
the
joy
of
the
anxious
watchers
the
doctor
did
not
waste
any
words
he
slipped
off
his
horse
and
entered
the
tent
presently
dick
stephenson
came
out
and
sat
down
beside
norah
to
await
the
verdict
i
ca
do
any
good
there
he
said
and
there
no
norah
nodded
just
then
there
seemed
nothing
to
say
to
this
son
whose
father
so
lately
given
back
from
the
grave
seemed
to
be
slipping
away
again
without
a
word
she
slid
her
hand
into
his
and
felt
his
fingers
close
warmly
upon
it
i
can
stand
it
he
said
brokenly
after
a
little
if
he
can
only
know
we
the
world
knows
he
was
never
guilty
if
i
can
only
tell
him
that
i
ca
bear
him
to
die
not
knowing
he
know
it
the
little
voice
was
very
low
but
the
lad
heard
it
i
i
guess
he
will
he
said
and
that
better
but
i
would
like
to
make
it
up
to
him
a
bit
while
he
then
they
were
silent
the
shadows
deepened
across
the
clearing
long
since
the
sun
had
disappeared
behind
the
rim
of
encircling
trees
the
tent
flaps
parted
and
the
doctor
and
linton
came
out
dick
rose
and
faced
them
he
could
not
utter
the
question
that
trembled
on
his
lips
the
doctor
nodded
cheerily
well
norah
he
said
yes
i
think
we
pull
the
patient
through
this
time
stephenson
it
be
a
fight
for
he
old
and
weakened
by
exposure
and
lack
of
proper
food
but
i
think
we
do
he
talked
on
hopefully
appearing
not
to
see
the
question
the
son
could
not
altogether
hide
take
him
home
yes
we
get
him
home
i
think
we
ca
nurse
him
out
here
the
following
with
all
sorts
of
comforting
things
trust
your
old
brown
for
that
norah
most
capable
woman
mattresses
air
pillows
nourishment
thought
of
everything
and
the
wagon
was
all
ready
to
start
when
i
got
to
billabong
by
the
way
billy
was
to
go
back
to
show
wright
the
way
where
are
you
billy
why
have
you
gone
plenty
said
billy
hastily
as
he
disappeared
queer
chap
that
said
anderson
lighting
a
cigarette
about
the
only
remark
he
made
all
day
and
in
the
motor
he
did
say
as
much
sat
like
an
ebony
statue
with
his
eyes
bulging
in
unholy
terror
i
hear
you
been
flying
all
over
the
country
norah
what
do
you
mean
by
looking
so
white
the
tale
of
norah
iniquities
was
unfolded
to
him
and
the
doctor
felt
her
pulse
in
a
friendly
way
you
have
to
go
to
bed
soon
he
said
ca
have
you
knocking
yourself
up
you
know
and
we
got
to
make
an
early
start
to
avoid
the
worst
heat
of
the
day
for
the
patient
also
you
will
take
a
small
tabloid
to
make
you
up
if
you
know
what
that
means
norah
norah
grinned
ah
well
stephenson
here
will
make
you
forget
all
that
undesirable
knowledge
before
long
lost
in
a
maze
of
euclid
and
latin
and
greek
and
trigonometry
and
things
i
say
gasped
norah
well
you
may
grinned
the
doctor
i
foresee
lively
times
for
you
and
your
tutor
in
the
paths
of
learning
young
lady
first
of
all
however
you
have
to
be
to
our
friend
the
patient
with
brown
as
head
and
that
reminds
me
someone
must
sit
up
that
my
privilege
said
dick
stephenson
quickly
and
all
that
night
after
the
camp
had
quieted
to
sleep
the
son
sat
beside
his
father
watching
in
the
silver
moonlight
every
change
that
flitted
across
the
wan
old
face
the
hermit
had
not
yet
recovered
consciousness
but
under
the
doctor
remedies
he
had
lost
the
terrible
restlessness
of
delirium
and
lay
for
the
most
part
calmly
in
heart
as
he
watched
him
dick
was
but
a
little
boy
again
loving
above
all
the
world
the
tall
daddy
who
was
his
hero
longing
with
all
the
little
boy
devotion
and
all
the
strength
of
his
manhood
to
make
up
to
him
for
the
years
he
had
suffered
alone
but
the
calm
face
on
the
bed
never
showed
sign
of
recognition
once
or
twice
the
hermit
muttered
and
his
boy
name
was
on
his
lips
the
pulse
fluttered
feebly
the
great
river
flowed
very
close
about
his
feet
chapter
xvii
the
end
of
the
struggle
the
long
slow
journey
to
billabong
homestead
was
accomplished
the
hermit
had
never
regained
consciousness
throughout
the
weary
hours
during
which
every
jolt
of
the
over
the
rough
tracks
had
sent
a
throb
to
the
hearts
of
the
watchers
all
unconscious
he
had
lain
while
they
lifted
him
from
the
bunk
where
he
had
slept
for
so
many
lonely
nights
the
men
packed
his
few
personal
belongings
quickly
norah
remembering
a
hint
dropped
by
the
hermit
in
other
days
had
instituted
a
search
for
buried
papers
which
resulted
in
the
unearthing
of
a
tin
box
containing
various
documents
she
had
insisted
too
that
the
rough
furniture
should
go
and
it
was
piled
in
the
front
of
the
wagon
another
man
had
brought
out
the
old
pack
mare
for
the
baggage
of
the
original
fishing
party
and
the
whole
cavalcade
moved
off
before
the
sun
had
got
above
the
horizon
but
it
was
a
tedious
journey
anderson
sat
beside
his
patient
watching
the
feeble
action
of
the
heart
and
the
flickering
pulse
plying
him
with
stimulants
and
nourishment
occasionally
calling
a
halt
for
a
few
minutes
complete
rest
close
to
the
wheel
dick
stephenson
rode
his
eyes
scarcely
leaving
his
father
face
on
the
other
side
norah
and
her
father
rode
in
silent
miserable
anxiety
fretting
at
their
utter
helplessness
anderson
glanced
sharply
now
and
then
at
the
little
girl
face
this
is
good
for
her
he
said
at
length
quietly
to
linton
she
had
too
much
already
take
her
he
raised
his
voice
better
go
on
he
said
let
brown
know
just
what
is
coming
need
you
to
help
her
prepare
the
patient
room
norah
you
too
i
wo
leave
him
thanks
he
said
i
rather
not
he
might
become
no
chance
of
that
the
doctor
said
best
not
too
until
we
have
him
safely
in
bed
however
stay
if
you
like
perhaps
it
as
well
i
think
linton
you
better
send
a
wire
to
melbourne
for
a
trained
and
one
to
mother
dick
said
quickly
that
gone
already
linton
said
i
sent
george
back
with
it
last
night
when
he
brought
the
mare
he
smiled
in
answer
to
grateful
look
well
come
on
the
remembrance
of
that
helpless
form
in
the
bottom
of
the
wagon
haunted
norah
memory
all
through
the
remainder
of
the
ride
home
she
was
thoroughly
tired
now
excitement
that
had
kept
her
up
the
day
before
had
prevented
her
from
sleeping
and
she
scarcely
could
keep
upright
in
the
saddle
however
she
set
her
teeth
to
show
no
sign
of
weakness
that
should
alarm
her
father
and
endeavoured
to
have
a
smile
for
him
whenever
his
anxious
gaze
swept
her
white
face
the
relief
of
seeing
the
red
roof
of
home
that
last
mile
was
the
longest
of
all
and
when
at
length
they
were
at
the
gate
and
she
had
climbed
stiffly
off
her
pony
she
could
only
lean
against
his
shoulder
and
shake
from
head
to
foot
linton
picked
her
up
bodily
and
carried
her
feebly
protesting
into
brown
only
knocked
up
he
said
in
answer
to
the
old
woman
terrified
exclamation
bed
is
all
she
needs
and
hot
soup
if
you
got
it
norah
dear
as
she
begged
to
be
allowed
to
remain
and
help
you
can
do
nothing
just
now
except
get
yourself
all
right
do
as
i
tell
you
girlie
and
in
an
astonishingly
short
space
of
time
norah
found
herself
tucked
up
in
bed
in
her
darkened
room
with
daddy
hand
fast
in
hers
and
a
comforting
feeling
of
everything
fading
away
to
darkness
and
sleep
it
was
twilight
when
she
opened
her
eyes
again
and
brownie
sat
knitting
by
her
side
bless
your
dear
heart
she
said
fervently
yes
the
old
come
an
he
quite
comfertable
in
bed
though
he
do
know
no
one
yet
anderson
gone
to
cunjee
but
he
coming
back
in
his
steam
engine
to
stay
all
night
an
your
pa
having
his
dinner
which
he
needs
it
poor
man
an
he
do
want
you
to
get
up
lovey
for
there
ai
nothin
you
can
do
i
go
and
get
you
something
to
but
it
was
linton
who
came
presently
bearing
a
tray
with
dainty
chicken
and
salad
and
a
glass
of
clear
golden
jelly
he
sat
by
norah
while
she
ate
we
pretty
anxious
dear
he
told
her
when
she
had
finished
and
was
snugly
lying
down
again
astonishingly
glad
of
her
soft
bed
you
wo
mind
my
not
staying
i
must
be
near
old
jim
i
be
glad
when
anderson
back
try
to
go
to
sleep
he
bent
to
kiss
her
you
do
know
what
a
comfort
your
sleep
has
been
to
me
my
girlie
he
said
it
was
the
third
day
of
the
struggle
with
death
over
the
unconscious
body
and
again
twilight
was
falling
upon
billabong
the
house
was
hushed
and
silent
no
footfall
was
allowed
to
sound
where
the
echo
might
penetrate
to
the
near
its
precincts
brown
and
the
melbourne
trained
nurse
reigned
supreme
and
anderson
came
and
went
as
often
as
he
could
manage
the
spin
out
from
cunjee
in
his
motor
norah
had
a
new
care
a
little
fragile
old
lady
with
snowy
hair
and
depths
of
infinite
sadness
in
her
eyes
whom
dick
stephenson
called
the
doctor
would
not
allow
either
mother
or
son
into
the
the
shock
of
recognition
should
the
hermit
regain
consciousness
suddenly
might
be
too
much
so
they
waited
about
agonisingly
anxious
pitifully
helpless
dick
rebelled
against
the
idleness
at
length
it
would
kill
him
he
said
and
borrowing
a
spade
from
the
chinese
gardener
he
spent
his
time
in
heavy
digging
within
easy
call
of
the
house
but
for
the
wife
and
mother
there
was
no
help
she
was
gently
courteous
to
all
gently
appreciative
of
norah
attempts
to
occupy
her
thoughts
but
throughout
it
all
whether
she
looked
at
the
pets
outside
or
walked
among
the
autumn
roses
in
the
garden
or
struggled
to
eat
at
the
table
she
was
listening
ever
listening
in
the
evening
of
the
third
day
linton
came
quickly
into
the
tears
were
falling
down
his
face
he
went
up
to
stephenson
and
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
it
it
all
right
we
think
he
said
brokenly
he
conscious
and
knew
me
dear
old
chap
i
was
sitting
by
the
bed
and
suddenly
his
eyes
opened
and
all
the
fever
had
gone
davy
he
said
i
told
him
everything
was
all
right
and
he
must
talk
and
he
taken
some
nourishment
and
gone
off
into
a
natural
sleep
anderson
then
he
caught
stephenson
quickly
as
she
slipped
to
his
feet
unconscious
then
there
were
days
of
dreary
waiting
of
slow
harassing
convalescence
the
patient
did
not
seem
to
be
alive
to
any
outside
thought
he
gained
strength
very
slowly
but
he
lay
always
silent
asking
no
questions
only
when
linton
entered
the
room
showing
any
sign
of
interest
the
doctor
was
vaguely
puzzled
vaguely
anxious
do
you
think
i
could
go
and
see
him
norah
was
outside
the
door
of
the
the
doctor
often
found
her
there
a
little
silent
figure
listening
vainly
for
her
friend
voice
she
looked
up
pleadingly
not
if
you
think
i
ought
to
she
said
i
do
believe
it
would
hurt
him
anderson
said
looking
down
at
her
might
wake
him
up
a
bit
i
know
you
wo
excite
so
it
was
that
the
hermit
waking
from
a
restless
sleep
found
by
his
side
a
small
person
with
brown
curls
that
he
remembered
why
it
my
little
friend
he
murmured
feeling
weakly
for
her
hand
this
seems
a
queer
world
old
friends
and
new
all
mixed
i
so
glad
you
better
dear
hermit
norah
said
she
bent
and
kissed
him
and
we
all
friends
you
did
that
once
before
he
said
feebly
no
one
had
kissed
me
for
such
a
long
long
while
but
must
let
why
asked
norah
blankly
because
because
people
do
think
much
of
me
miss
norah
he
said
a
deep
shade
falling
on
his
fine
old
face
they
say
i
no
good
i
suppose
i
be
allowed
to
be
here
only
i
an
old
man
and
i
going
to
but
you
not
norah
cried
dr
anderson
says
you
not
and
and
oh
you
making
a
great
mistake
everyone
wants
me
said
the
hermit
in
sudden
bitter
scorn
no
only
strangers
like
you
not
my
oh
you
do
know
norah
protested
she
was
painfully
aware
of
the
order
not
to
excite
the
patient
but
it
was
awful
to
let
him
be
so
unhappy
dad
not
a
stranger
he
always
knew
you
and
see
how
he
wants
you
dad
the
hermit
questioned
feebly
is
david
linton
your
father
she
nodded
and
for
a
minute
he
was
silent
no
wonder
you
and
i
were
friends
he
said
but
you
not
all
not
even
you
and
no
but
he
forced
a
smile
in
pity
for
her
perplexity
dear
little
girl
you
do
understand
he
said
there
something
even
friendship
ca
wipe
out
though
such
friendship
as
your
can
bridge
it
over
but
it
always
there
a
black
cruel
gulf
and
that
disgrace
norah
could
not
bear
the
misery
of
his
eyes
but
if
it
all
a
horrible
mistake
she
said
if
everybody
knew
it
if
it
a
mistake
the
hermit
hand
was
on
her
wrist
like
a
vice
for
a
moment
norah
shivered
in
fear
of
what
her
words
might
have
done
what
do
you
mean
for
god
sake
tell
me
she
steadied
her
voice
to
answer
him
bravely
please
you
must
get
excited
dear
hermit
she
said
i
tell
you
dad
told
me
all
about
it
before
we
found
you
it
all
a
terrible
mistake
every
one
knows
you
were
a
good
man
everyone
wants
to
be
friends
with
you
only
they
thought
you
were
i
managed
his
voice
was
sharp
and
eager
i
saw
the
other
body
in
the
river
and
the
rest
was
he
struggled
for
calmness
and
norah
held
a
glass
of
water
to
his
lips
please
do
get
excited
she
begged
i
wo
he
smiled
at
her
tell
me
does
everyone
know
everyone
norah
nodded
there
was
a
step
behind
her
and
a
sudden
light
flashed
into
the
hermit
eyes
davy
is
it
true
i
am
cleared
years
ago
old
david
linton
voice
was
husky
all
the
world
wants
to
make
it
up
to
all
the
world
they
only
two
the
sick
man
said
do
they
know
where
are
they
for
a
moment
linton
hesitated
not
knowing
what
risk
he
might
run
oh
for
pity
sake
do
be
cautious
david
the
hermit
begged
be
calm
anything
only
do
refuse
a
starving
man
bread
davy

me
they
here

here

i
will
they
ah

to
be
careful
of

jim
old
chap
linton
said
you
been
a
very
sick
man
and
you
not
better
yet
but
only
living
on
the
hope
of
seeing
you
of
having
you
again
of
making
it
up
to

they
believe
in
me
the
boy
dick
never
believed
a
word
against
you
linton
said
and
your
wife
ah

she
doubted
she
has
paid
for
it
again
and
again
in
tears

her
jim

he
said
simply
i
been
bitter
enough
god
knows
but
it
all
seems
gone
you
bring
her
davy
but
at
the
word
norah
was
out
of
the
room
racing
along
the
hall
out
in
the
gardens
dick
stephenson
dug
mightily
in
the
hard
soil
and
his
mother
watched
him
listening
always
she
heard
the
flying
footsteps
on
the
gravel
and
turned
quickly
to
meet
norah
mr
stephenson
he
wants
you
is
he
worse
dick
gasped
no
i
think
he
all
right
but
he
knows
everything
and
he
wants
you
both
in
his
room
the
hermit
heard
the
steps
in
the
hall
the
light
slow
feet
and
the
man
tread
that
curbed
its
impatience
lingering
to
support
them
his
breath
came
quickly
as
he
stared
at
the
door
then
for
a
moment
they
faced
each
other
after
the
weary
years
each
gaunt
and
wan
and
old
but
in
their
eyes
the
light
and
the
love
of
long
ago
the
hermit
eyes
wandered
an
instant
to
his
son
face
seeking
in
the
stalwart
man
the
little
lad
he
knew
then
they
came
back
to
his
wife
mary
jim
she
tottered
to
the
bed
jim
can
you
forgive
me
forgive
oh
my
girl
the
two
grey
heads
were
close
together
david
linton
slipped
from
the
room
chapter
xviii
evening
they
were
all
sitting
on
the
lawn
in
the
twilight
norah
had
dispensed
afternoon
tea
with
laborious
energy
ably
seconded
by
dick
who
carried
cups
and
cake
and
made
himself
generally
useful
then
they
had
talked
until
the
sun
slipped
over
the
edge
of
the
plain
there
was
so
much
to
talk
of
in
those
days
the
hermit
had
been
allowed
to
leave
his
room
a
fortnight
since
he
was
still
weak
but
strength
was
coming
every
day
strength
that
follows
on
happiness
norah
declared
he
grew
better
every
day
and
no
one
contradicted
her
he
and
his
wife
sat
hand
in
hand
they
were
rarely
seen
any
other
way
perfect
content
on
each
placid
face
dick
lay
on
the
grass
at
their
feet
and
smoked
and
threw
stems
of
buffalo
grass
at
norah
who
returned
them
honourably
linton
also
smoking
surveyed
the
group
with
satisfaction
they
had
been
talking
over
plans
for
the
future
plans
which
linton
masterfulness
modified
very
considerably
go
away
he
said
certainly
not
i
engaged
your
son
as
tutor
to
my
daughter
and
i
really
ca
spare
him
from
the
poor
neglected
child
then
as
you
curiously
enough
do
wish
to
leave
your
son
the
course
is
quite
clear
you
must
stay
i
not
going
to
live
on
you
you
need
i
bitterly
in
need
of
someone
with
a
head
for
figures
a
thing
i
never
possessed
you
can
help
me
tremendously
and
good
as
dear
old
brownie
is
i
know
norah
ought
to
be
with
a
gentlewoman
to
learn
the
things
that
are
in
school
books
it
the
best
chance
you
and
i
have
ever
had
is
it
norah
we
are
going
to
let
it
or
you
slip
through
our
it

all
very
well
davy
old
man
i
know
it
is
now
ca
you

alone
jim

of
it
again
in
five
years
time

may
have
better
luck
then
i
do
say
you
will
but
you
may
hang
it
all
man
you
not
going
to
thwart
me
when
i
just
got
my
family
together
well
i
wo
for
a
while
the
hermit
immediately
received
a
kiss
on
the
top
of
his
head
thank
you
norah
he
said
meekly
do
mention
it
norah
answered
politely
oh
i
so
glad
going
to
stay
with
us
hermit
norah
had
flatly
declined
to
call
her
friend
anything
but
the
name
she
had
given
him
in
the
bush
as
for
the
hermit
he
was
perfectly
content
with
anything
norah
did
and
had
no
idea
of
objecting
you
heard
did
you
norah
that
they
found
your
friend
the
winfield
murderer
linton
asked
daddy
no
found
his
body
in
an
old
shaft
not
far
from
winfield
he
had
the
stolen
property
on
him
so
there
no
doubt
of
his
guilt
so
that
clears
your
hermit
even
in
your
suspicious
mind
ah
do
daddy
norah
said
flushing
i
was
suspicious
i
was
a
i
do
think
you
were
the
hermit
said
decidedly
a
very
sensible
duffer
dick
laughed
no
use
trying
to
come
between
those
two
he
said
not
a
bit
said
the
hermit
with
great
cheerfulness
he
smiled
at
norah
you
brought
me
back
to
life
when
i
think
but
for
norah
stephenson
murmured
brokenly
no
one
would
have
known
you
were
dying
in
that
dreadful
yes
said
the
hermit
but
i
did
know
anything
about
it
my
best
memory
is
of
my
little
friend
who
brought
me
good
news
when
i
was
wishing
with
all
my
soul
that
i
died
in
the
tent
do
jim
said
linton
well
between
one
and
another
there
a
fair
chance
of
spoiling
my
pupil
laughed
dick
stretching
himself
i
have
to
be
doubly
stern
to
counteract
the
evil
influences
norah
you
can
prepare
for
awful
times
when
next
monday
comes
linton
may
it
be
soon
you
can
say
to
your
pickle
of
a
daughter
she
will
come
out
from
my
mill
ground
into
the
most
approved
type
of
young
lady
accomplishments
prunes
and
prisms
personified
linton
laughed
will
she
he
said
pulling
norah
hair
gently
i
wonder
well
you
can
do
your
worst
dick
somehow
i
fancy
that
under
all
the
varnish
i
find
my
little
bush
the
end
