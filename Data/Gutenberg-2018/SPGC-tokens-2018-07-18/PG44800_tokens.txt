of
frédéric
bastiat
classic
essay
the
law
first
published
in
by
the
great
french
economist
and
journalist
it
is
as
clear
a
statement
as
has
ever
been
made
of
the
original
american
ideal
of
government
as
proclaimed
in
the
declaration
of
independence
that
the
main
purpose
of
any
government
is
the
protection
of
the
lives
liberties
and
property
of
its
citizens
bastiat
believed
that
all
human
beings
possessed
the
natural
rights
of
individuality
liberty
property
this
is
man
he
wrote
these
three
gifts
from
god
precede
all
human
legislation
but
even
in
his
time
writing
in
the
late
bastiat
was
alarmed
over
how
the
law
had
been
perverted
into
an
instrument
of
what
he
called
legal
plunder
far
from
protecting
individual
rights
the
law
was
increasingly
used
to
deprive
one
group
of
citizens
of
those
rights
for
the
benefit
of
another
group
and
especially
for
the
benefit
of
the
state
itself
he
condemned
the
legal
plunder
of
protectionist
vi
tariffs
government
subsidies
of
all
kinds
progressive
taxation
public
schools
government
jobs
programs
minimum
wage
laws
welfare
usury
laws
and
more
bastiat
warnings
of
the
dire
effects
of
legal
plunder
are
as
relevant
today
as
they
were
the
day
he
first
issued
them
the
system
of
legal
plunder
which
many
now
celebrate
as
democracy
will
erase
from
everyone
conscience
he
wrote
the
distinction
between
justice
and
injustice
the
plundered
classes
will
eventually
figure
out
how
to
enter
the
political
game
and
plunder
their
fellow
man
legislation
will
never
be
guided
by
any
principles
of
justice
but
only
by
brute
political
force
the
great
french
champion
of
liberty
also
forecast
the
corruption
of
education
by
the
state
those
who
held
teaching
positions
he
wrote
would
rarely
criticize
legal
plunder
lest
their
government
endowments
be
ended
the
system
of
legal
plunder
would
also
greatly
exaggerate
the
importance
of
politics
in
society
that
would
be
a
most
unhealthy
development
as
it
would
encourage
even
more
citizens
to
seek
to
improve
their
own
not
by
producing
goods
and
services
for
the
marketplace
but
by
plundering
their
fellow
citizens
through
politics
bastiat
was
also
wise
enough
to
anticipate
what
modern
economists
call
rent
seeking
and
rent
avoidance
behavior
these
two
clumsy
phrases
refer
respectively
to
the
phenomena
of
lobbying
for
political
favors
legal
plunder
and
of
engaging
in
political
activity
directed
at
protecting
oneself
from
being
the
victim
of
plunder
seekers
for
example
the
steel
manufacturing
industry
lobbies
for
high
tariffs
on
steel
whereas
industries
like
the
automobile
industry
can
be
expected
to
lobby
against
high
tariffs
on
steel
vii
the
reason
why
modem
economists
are
concerned
about
rent
seeking
is
the
opportunity
cost
involved
the
more
time
effort
and
money
that
is
spent
by
businesses
on
conniving
to
manipulate
politics
merely
transferring
wealth
the
less
time
is
spent
on
producing
goods
and
services
which
increases
wealth
thus
legal
plunder
impoverishes
the
entire
society
despite
the
fact
that
a
small
but
politically
influential
part
of
the
society
benefits
from
it
it
is
remarkable
in
reading
the
law
how
perfectly
accurate
bastiat
was
in
describing
the
statists
of
his
day
which
it
turns
out
were
not
much
different
from
the
statists
of
today
or
any
other
day
the
french
socialists
of
bastiat
day
espoused
doctrines
that
perverted
charity
education
and
morals
for
one
thing
true
charity
does
not
begin
with
the
robbery
of
taxation
he
pointed
out
government
schooling
is
inevitably
an
exercise
in
statist
brainwashing
not
genuine
education
and
it
is
hardly
moral
for
a
large
gang
government
to
legally
rob
one
segment
of
the
population
keep
most
of
the
loot
and
share
a
little
of
it
with
various
needy
individuals
socialists
want
to
play
god
bastiat
observed
anticipating
all
the
future
tyrants
and
despots
of
the
world
who
would
try
to
remake
the
world
in
their
image
whether
that
image
would
be
communism
fascism
the
glorious
union
or
global
democracy
bastiat
also
observed
that
socialists
wanted
forced
conformity
rigid
regimentation
of
the
population
through
pervasive
regulation
forced
equality
of
wealth
and
dictatorship
as
such
they
were
the
mortal
enemies
of
liberty
dictatorship
need
not
involve
an
actual
dictator
all
that
was
needed
said
bastiat
was
the
laws
enacted
viii
by
a
congress
or
a
parliament
that
would
achieve
the
same
effect
forced
conformity
bastiat
was
also
wise
to
point
out
that
the
world
has
far
too
many
great
men
fathers
of
their
countries
who
in
reality
are
usually
nothing
but
petty
tyrants
with
a
sick
and
compulsive
desire
to
rule
over
others
the
defenders
of
the
free
society
should
have
a
healthy
disrespect
for
all
such
men
bastiat
admired
america
and
pointed
to
the
america
of
as
being
as
close
as
any
society
in
the
world
to
his
ideal
of
a
government
that
protected
individual
rights
to
life
liberty
and
property
there
were
two
major
exeptions
however
the
twin
evils
of
slavery
and
protectionist
tariffs
frédéric
bastiat
died
on
christmas
eve
and
did
not
live
to
observe
the
convulsions
that
the
america
he
admired
so
much
would
go
through
in
the
next
fifteen
years
and
longer
it
is
unlikely
that
he
would
have
considered
the
government
military
invasion
of
the
southern
states
in
the
killing
of
some
citizens
and
the
bombing
burning
and
plundering
of
the
region
cities
towns
farms
and
businesses
as
being
consistent
in
any
way
with
the
protection
of
the
lives
liberties
and
properties
of
those
citizens
as
promised
by
the
declaration
of
independence
had
he
lived
to
see
all
of
this
he
most
likely
would
have
added
legal
murder
to
legal
plunder
as
one
of
the
two
great
sins
of
government
he
would
likely
have
viewed
the
republican
party
with
its
percent
average
tariff
rates
its
massive
corporate
welfare
schemes
and
its
campaign
of
genocide
against
the
plains
indians
as
plunderers
and
traitors
to
the
american
ideal
in
the
latter
pages
of
the
law
bastiat
offers
the
sage
advice
that
what
was
really
needed
was
a
science
of
ix
economics
that
would
explain
the
harmony
or
lack
thereof
of
a
free
society
as
opposed
to
socialism
he
made
a
major
contribution
to
this
end
himself
with
the
publication
of
his
book
which
can
be
construed
as
a
precursor
to
the
modern
literature
of
the
austrian
school
of
economics
there
is
no
substitute
for
a
solid
understanding
of
the
market
order
and
of
the
realities
of
politics
when
it
comes
to
combating
the
kinds
of
destructive
socialistic
schemes
that
plagued
bastiat
day
as
well
as
ours
anyone
who
reads
this
great
essay
along
with
other
classics
such
as
henry
economics
in
one
lesson
and
murray
power
and
market
will
possess
enough
intellectual
ammunition
to
debunk
the
socialist
fantasies
of
this
or
any
other
day

is
professor
of
economics
at
loyola
college
in
maryland
and
a
member
of
the
senior
faculty
of
the
mises
institute
the
law
the
law
perverted
the
law
and
in
its
wake
all
the
collective
forces
of
the
nation
the
law
i
say
not
only
diverted
from
its
proper
direction
but
made
to
pursue
one
entirely
contrary
the
law
become
the
tool
of
every
kind
of
avarice
instead
of
being
its
check
the
law
guilty
of
that
very
iniquity
which
it
was
its
mission
to
punish
truly
this
is
a
serious
fact
if
it
exists
and
one
to
which
i
feel
bound
to
call
the
attention
of
my
fellow
citizens
we
hold
from
god
the
gift
that
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
contains
all
others
life
physical
intellectual
and
moral
life
but
life
can
not
support
itself
he
who
has
bestowed
it
has
entrusted
us
with
the
care
of
supporting
it
of
developing
it
and
of
perfecting
it
to
that
end
he
has
provided
us
with
a
collection
of
wonderful
faculties
he
has
plunged
us
into
the
midst
of
a
variety
of
elements
it
is
by
the
application
of
our
faculties
to
these
elements
that
the
phenomena
of
assimilation
and
of
appropriation
by
which
life
pursues
the
circle
that
has
been
assigned
to
it
are
realized
existence
faculties
assimilation
in
other
words
personality
liberty
property
this
is
man
it
is
of
these
three
things
that
it
may
be
said
apart
from
all
demagogic
subtlety
that
they
are
anterior
and
superior
to
all
human
legislation
it
is
not
because
men
have
made
laws
that
personality
liberty
and
property
exist
on
the
contrary
it
is
because
personality
liberty
and
property
exist
beforehand
that
men
make
laws
what
then
is
law
as
i
have
said
elsewhere
it
is
the
collective
organization
of
the
individual
right
to
lawful
defense
nature
or
rather
god
has
bestowed
upon
every
one
of
us
the
right
to
defend
his
person
his
liberty
and
his
property
since
these
are
the
three
constituent
or
preserving
elements
of
life
elements
each
of
which
is
rendered
complete
by
the
others
and
that
can
not
be
understood
without
them
for
what
are
our
faculties
but
the
extension
of
our
personality
and
what
is
property
but
an
extension
of
our
faculties
if
every
man
has
the
right
of
defending
even
by
force
his
person
his
liberty
and
his
property
a
number
of
men
have
the
right
to
combine
together
to
extend
to
organize
a
common
force
to
provide
regularly
for
this
defense
collective
right
then
has
its
principle
its
reason
for
existing
its
lawfulness
in
individual
right
and
the
common
force
can
not
rationally
have
any
other
end
or
any
other
mission
than
that
of
the
isolated
forces
for
which
it
is
substituted
thus
as
the
force
of
an
individual
can
not
lawfully
touch
the
person
the
liberty
or
the
property
of
another
individual
for
the
same
reason
the
common
force
can
not
lawfully
be
used
to
destroy
the
person
the
liberty
or
the
property
of
individuals
or
of
classes
for
this
perversion
of
force
would
be
in
one
case
as
in
the
other
in
contradiction
to
our
premises
for
who
will
dare
to
say
that
force
has
been
given
to
us
not
to
defend
our
rights
but
to
annihilate
the
equal
rights
of
our
brethren
and
if
this
be
not
true
of
every
individual
force
acting
independently
how
can
it
be
true
of
the
collective
force
which
is
only
the
organized
union
of
isolated
forces
nothing
therefore
can
be
more
evident
than
this
the
law
is
the
organization
of
the
natural
right
of
lawful
defense
it
is
the
substitution
of
collective
for
individual
forces
for
the
purpose
of
acting
in
the
sphere
in
which
they
have
a
right
to
act
of
doing
what
they
have
a
right
to
do
to
secure
persons
liberties
and
properties
and
to
maintain
each
in
its
right
so
as
to
cause
justice
to
reign
over
all
and
if
a
people
established
upon
this
basis
were
to
exist
it
seems
to
me
that
order
would
prevail
among
them
in
their
acts
as
well
as
in
their
ideas
it
seems
to
me
that
such
a
people
would
have
the
most
simple
the
most
economical
the
least
oppressive
the
least
to
be
felt
the
most
restrained
the
most
just
and
consequently
the
most
stable
government
that
could
be
imagined
whatever
its
political
form
might
be
for
under
such
an
administration
everyone
would
feel
that
he
possessed
all
the
fullness
as
well
as
all
the
responsibility
of
his
existence
so
long
as
personal
safety
was
ensured
so
long
as
labor
was
free
and
the
fruits
of
labor
secured
against
all
unjust
attacks
no
one
would
have
any
difficulties
to
contend
with
in
the
state
when
prosperous
we
should
not
it
is
true
have
to
thank
the
state
for
our
success
but
when
unfortunate
we
should
no
more
think
of
taxing
it
with
our
disasters
than
our
peasants
think
of
attributing
to
it
the
arrival
of
hail
or
of
frost
we
should
know
it
only
by
the
inestimable
blessing
of
safety
it
may
further
be
affirmed
that
thanks
to
the
nonintervention
of
the
state
in
private
affairs
our
wants
and
their
satisfactions
would
develop
themselves
in
their
natural
order
we
should
not
see
poor
families
seeking
for
literary
instruction
before
they
were
supplied
with
bread
we
should
not
see
towns
peopled
at
the
expense
of
rural
districts
nor
rural
districts
at
the
expense
of
towns
we
should
not
see
those
great
displacements
of
capital
of
labor
and
of
population
that
legislative
measures
occasion
displacements
that
render
so
uncertain
and
precarious
the
very
sources
of
existence
and
thus
enlarge
to
such
an
extent
the
responsibility
of
governments
unhappily
law
is
by
no
means
confined
to
its
own
sphere
nor
is
it
merely
in
some
ambiguous
and
debatable
views
that
it
has
left
its
proper
sphere
it
has
done
more
than
this
it
has
acted
in
direct
opposition
to
its
proper
end
it
has
destroyed
its
own
object
it
has
been
employed
in
annihilating
that
justice
which
it
ought
to
have
established
in
effacing
amongst
rights
that
limit
which
it
was
its
true
mission
to
respect
it
has
placed
the
collective
force
in
the
service
of
those
who
wish
to
traffic
without
risk
and
without
scruple
in
the
persons
the
liberty
and
the
property
of
others
it
has
converted
plunder
into
a
right
that
it
may
protect
it
and
lawful
defense
into
a
crime
that
it
may
punish
it
how
has
this
perversion
of
law
been
accomplished
and
what
has
resulted
from
it
the
law
has
been
perverted
through
the
influence
of
two
very
different
causes
naked
greed
and
misconceived
philanthropy
let
us
speak
of
the
former
and
development
is
the
common
aspiration
of
all
men
in
such
a
way
that
if
every
one
enjoyed
the
free
exercise
of
his
faculties
and
the
free
disposition
of
their
fruits
social
progress
would
be
incessant
uninterrupted
inevitable
but
there
is
also
another
disposition
which
is
common
to
them
this
is
to
live
and
to
develop
when
they
can
at
the
expense
of
one
another
this
is
no
rash
imputation
emanating
from
a
gloomy
uncharitable
spirit
history
bears
witness
to
the
truth
of
it
by
the
incessant
wars
the
migrations
of
races
sectarian
oppressions
the
universality
of
slavery
the
frauds
in
trade
and
the
monopolies
with
which
its
annals
abound
this
fatal
disposition
has
its
origin
in
the
very
constitution
of
man
in
that
primitive
and
universal
and
invincible
sentiment
that
urges
it
towards
its
and
makes
it
seek
to
escape
pain
man
can
only
derive
life
and
enjoyment
from
a
perpetual
search
and
appropriation
that
is
from
a
perpetual
application
of
his
faculties
to
objects
or
from
labor
this
is
the
origin
of
property
but
also
he
may
live
and
enjoy
by
seizing
and
appropriating
the
productions
of
the
faculties
of
his
fellow
men
this
is
the
origin
of
plunder
now
labor
being
in
itself
a
pain
and
man
being
naturally
inclined
to
avoid
pain
it
follows
and
history
proves
it
that
wherever
plunder
is
less
burdensome
than
labor
it
prevails
and
neither
religion
nor
morality
can
in
this
case
prevent
it
from
prevailing
when
does
plunder
cease
then
when
it
becomes
more
burdensome
and
more
dangerous
than
labor
it
is
very
evident
that
the
proper
aim
of
law
is
to
oppose
the
fatal
tendency
to
plunder
with
the
powerful
obstacle
of
collective
force
that
all
its
measures
should
be
in
favor
of
property
and
against
plunder
but
the
law
is
made
generally
by
one
man
or
by
one
class
of
men
and
as
law
can
not
exist
without
the
sanction
and
the
support
of
a
preponderant
force
it
must
finally
place
this
force
in
the
hands
of
those
who
legislate
this
inevitable
phenomenon
combined
with
the
fatal
tendency
that
we
have
said
exists
in
the
heart
of
man
explains
the
almost
universal
perversion
of
law
it
is
easy
to
conceive
that
instead
of
being
a
check
upon
injustice
it
becomes
its
most
invincible
instrument
it
is
easy
to
conceive
that
according
to
the
power
of
the
legislator
it
destroys
for
its
own
profit
and
in
different
degrees
amongst
the
rest
of
the
community
personal
independence
by
slavery
liberty
by
oppression
and
property
by
plunder
it
is
in
the
nature
of
men
to
rise
against
the
injustice
of
which
they
are
the
victims
when
therefore
plunder
is
organized
by
law
for
the
profit
of
those
who
perpetrate
it
all
the
plundered
classes
tend
either
by
peaceful
or
revolutionary
means
to
enter
in
some
way
into
the
manufacturing
of
laws
these
classes
according
to
the
degree
of
enlightenment
at
which
they
have
arrived
may
propose
to
themselves
two
very
different
ends
when
they
thus
attempt
the
attainment
of
their
political
rights
either
they
may
wish
to
put
an
end
to
lawful
plunder
or
they
may
desire
to
take
part
in
it
woe
to
the
nation
where
this
latter
thought
prevails
amongst
the
masses
at
the
moment
when
they
in
their
turn
seize
upon
the
legislative
power
up
to
that
time
lawful
plunder
has
been
exercised
by
the
few
upon
the
many
as
is
the
case
in
countries
where
the
right
of
legislating
is
confined
to
a
few
hands
but
now
it
has
become
universal
and
the
equilibrium
is
sought
in
universal
plunder
the
injustice
that
society
contains
instead
of
being
rooted
out
of
it
is
generalized
as
soon
as
the
injured
classes
have
recovered
their
political
rights
their
first
thought
is
not
to
abolish
plunder
this
would
suppose
them
to
possess
enlightenment
which
they
can
not
have
but
to
organize
against
the
other
classes
and
to
their
own
detriment
a
system
of
reprisals
as
if
it
was
necessary
before
the
reign
of
justice
arrives
that
all
should
undergo
a
cruel
retribution
some
for
their
iniquity
and
some
for
their
ignorance
it
would
be
impossible
therefore
to
introduce
into
society
a
greater
change
and
a
greater
evil
than
this
the
conversion
of
the
law
into
an
instrument
of
plunder
what
would
be
the
consequences
of
such
a
perversion
it
would
require
volumes
to
describe
them
all
we
must
content
ourselves
with
pointing
out
the
most
striking
in
the
first
place
it
would
efface
from
everybody
conscience
the
distinction
between
justice
and
injustice
no
society
can
exist
unless
the
laws
are
respected
to
a
certain
degree
but
the
safest
way
to
make
them
respected
is
to
make
them
respectable
when
law
and
morality
are
in
contradiction
to
each
other
the
citizen
finds
himself
in
the
cruel
alternative
of
either
losing
his
moral
sense
or
of
losing
his
respect
for
the
law
two
evils
of
equal
magnitude
between
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
choose
it
is
so
much
in
the
nature
of
law
to
support
justice
that
in
the
minds
of
the
masses
they
are
one
and
the
same
there
is
in
all
of
us
a
strong
disposition
to
regard
what
is
lawful
as
legitimate
so
much
so
that
many
falsely
derive
all
justice
from
law
it
is
sufficient
then
for
the
law
to
order
and
sanction
plunder
that
it
may
appear
to
many
consciences
just
and
sacred
slavery
protection
and
monopoly
find
defenders
not
only
in
those
who
profit
by
them
but
in
those
who
suffer
by
them
if
you
suggest
a
doubt
as
to
the
morality
of
these
institutions
it
is
said
directly
you
are
a
dangerous
experimenter
a
utopian
a
theorist
a
despiser
of
the
laws
you
would
shake
the
basis
upon
which
society
rests
if
you
lecture
upon
morality
or
political
economy
official
bodies
will
be
found
to
make
this
request
to
the
government
that
henceforth
science
be
taught
not
only
with
sole
reference
to
free
exchange
to
liberty
property
and
justice
as
has
been
the
case
up
to
the
present
time
but
also
and
especially
with
reference
to
the
facts
and
legislation
contrary
to
liberty
property
and
justice
that
regulate
french
industry
that
in
public
lecterns
salaried
by
the
treasury
the
professor
abstain
rigorously
from
endangering
in
the
slightest
degree
the
respect
due
to
the
laws
now
in
force
so
that
if
a
law
exists
that
sanctions
slavery
or
monopoly
oppression
or
plunder
in
any
form
whatever
it
must
not
even
be
mentioned
for
how
can
it
be
mentioned
without
damaging
the
respect
that
it
inspires
still
further
morality
and
political
economy
must
be
taught
in
connection
with
this
law
that
is
under
the
supposition
that
it
must
be
just
only
because
it
is
law
another
effect
of
this
deplorable
perversion
of
the
law
is
that
it
gives
to
human
passions
and
to
political
struggles
and
in
general
to
politics
properly
so
called
an
exaggerated
importance
i
could
prove
this
assertion
in
a
thousand
ways
but
i
shall
confine
myself
by
way
of
an
illustration
to
bringing
it
to
bear
upon
a
subject
which
has
of
late
occupied
everybody
mind
universal
suffrage
whatever
may
be
thought
of
it
by
the
adepts
of
the
school
of
rousseau
which
professes
to
be
very
far
advanced
but
which
i
consider
centuries
behind
universal
suffrage
taking
the
word
in
its
strictest
sense
is
not
one
of
those
sacred
dogmas
with
respect
to
which
examination
and
doubt
are
crimes
serious
objections
may
be
made
to
it
in
the
first
place
the
word
universal
conceals
a
gross
sophism
there
are
in
france
inhabitants
to
make
the
right
of
suffrage
universal
electors
should
be
reckoned
the
most
extended
system
reckons
only
three
persons
out
of
four
then
are
excluded
and
more
than
this
they
are
excluded
by
the
fourth
upon
what
principle
is
this
exclusion
founded
upon
the
principle
of
incapacity
universal
suffrage
then
means
universal
suffrage
of
those
who
are
capable
in
point
of
fact
who
are
the
capable
are
age
sex
and
judicial
condemnations
the
only
conditions
to
which
incapacity
is
to
be
attached
on
taking
a
nearer
view
of
the
subject
we
may
soon
perceive
the
reason
why
the
right
of
suffrage
depends
upon
the
presumption
of
incapacity
the
most
extended
system
differing
from
the
most
restricted
in
the
conditions
on
which
this
incapacity
depends
and
which
constitutes
not
a
difference
in
principle
but
in
degree
this
motive
is
that
the
elector
does
not
stipulate
for
himself
but
for
everybody
if
as
the
republicans
of
the
greek
and
roman
tone
pretend
the
right
of
suffrage
had
fallen
to
the
lot
of
every
one
at
his
birth
it
would
be
an
injustice
to
adults
to
prevent
women
and
children
from
voting
why
are
they
prevented
because
they
are
presumed
to
be
incapable
and
why
is
incapacity
a
reason
for
exclusion
because
the
elector
does
not
reap
alone
the
responsibility
of
his
vote
because
every
vote
engages
and
affects
the
community
at
large
because
the
community
has
a
right
to
demand
some
assurances
as
regards
the
acts
upon
which
its
and
its
existence
depend
i
know
what
might
be
said
in
answer
to
this
i
know
what
might
be
objected
but
this
is
not
the
place
to
settle
a
controversy
of
this
kind
what
i
wish
to
observe
is
this
that
this
same
controversy
in
common
with
the
greater
part
of
political
questions
that
agitates
excites
and
unsettles
the
nations
would
lose
almost
all
its
importance
if
the
law
had
always
been
what
it
ought
to
be
in
fact
if
law
were
confined
to
causing
all
persons
all
liberties
and
all
properties
to
be
respected
if
it
were
merely
the
organization
of
individual
right
and
individual
defense
if
it
were
the
obstacle
the
check
the
chastisement
opposed
to
all
oppression
to
all
plunder
is
it
likely
that
we
should
dispute
much
as
citizens
on
the
subject
of
the
greater
or
lesser
universality
of
suffrage
is
it
likely
that
it
would
compromise
that
greatest
of
advantages
the
public
peace
is
it
likely
that
the
excluded
classes
would
not
quietly
wait
for
their
turn
is
it
likely
that
the
enfranchised
classes
would
be
very
jealous
of
their
privilege
and
is
it
not
clear
that
the
interest
of
all
being
one
and
the
same
some
would
act
without
much
inconvenience
to
the
others
but
if
the
fatal
principle
should
come
to
be
introduced
that
under
pretense
of
organization
regulation
protection
or
encouragement
the
law
may
take
from
one
party
in
order
to
give
to
another
help
itself
to
the
wealth
acquired
by
all
the
classes
that
it
may
increase
that
of
one
class
whether
that
of
the
agriculturists
the
manufacturers
the
ship
owners
or
artists
and
comedians
then
certainly
in
this
case
there
is
no
class
which
may
not
try
and
with
reason
to
place
its
hand
upon
the
law
that
would
not
demand
with
fury
its
right
of
election
and
eligibility
and
that
would
overturn
society
rather
than
not
obtain
it
even
beggars
and
vagabonds
will
prove
to
you
that
they
have
an
incontestable
title
to
it
they
will
say
we
never
buy
wine
tobacco
or
salt
without
paying
the
tax
and
a
part
of
this
tax
is
given
by
law
in
perquisites
and
gratuities
to
men
who
are
richer
than
we
are
others
make
use
of
the
law
to
create
an
artificial
rise
in
the
price
of
bread
meat
iron
or
cloth
since
everybody
traffics
in
law
for
his
own
profit
we
should
like
to
do
the
same
we
should
like
to
make
it
produce
the
right
to
assistance
which
is
the
poor
plunder
to
effect
this
we
ought
to
be
electors
and
legislators
that
we
may
organize
on
a
large
scale
alms
for
our
own
class
as
you
have
organized
on
a
large
scale
protection
for
yours
do
tell
us
that
you
will
take
our
cause
upon
yourselves
and
throw
to
us
francs
to
keep
us
quiet
like
giving
us
a
bone
to
pick
we
have
other
claims
and
at
any
rate
we
wish
to
stipulate
for
ourselves
as
other
classes
have
stipulated
for
themselves
how
is
this
argument
to
be
answered
yes
as
long
as
it
is
admitted
that
the
law
may
be
diverted
from
its
true
mission
that
it
may
violate
property
instead
of
securing
it
everybody
will
be
wanting
to
manufacture
law
either
to
defend
himself
against
plunder
or
to
organize
it
for
his
own
profit
the
political
question
will
always
be
prejudicial
predominant
and
absorbing
in
a
word
there
will
be
fighting
around
the
door
of
the
legislative
palace
the
struggle
will
be
no
less
furious
within
it
to
be
convinced
of
this
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
look
at
what
passes
in
the
chambers
in
france
and
in
england
it
is
enough
to
know
how
the
question
stands
is
there
any
need
to
prove
that
this
odious
perversion
of
law
is
a
perpetual
source
of
hatred
and
discord
that
it
even
tends
to
social
disorganization
look
at
the
united
states
there
is
no
country
in
the
world
where
the
law
is
kept
more
within
its
proper
domain
which
is
to
secure
to
everyone
his
liberty
and
his
property
therefore
there
is
no
country
in
the
world
where
social
order
appears
to
rest
upon
a
more
solid
basis
nevertheless
even
in
the
united
states
there
are
two
questions
and
only
two
that
from
the
beginning
have
endangered
political
order
and
what
are
these
two
questions
that
of
slavery
and
that
of
tariffs
that
is
precisely
the
only
two
questions
in
which
contrary
to
the
general
spirit
of
this
republic
law
has
taken
the
character
of
a
plunderer
slavery
is
a
violation
sanctioned
by
law
of
the
rights
of
the
person
protection
is
a
violation
perpetrated
by
the
law
upon
the
rights
of
property
and
certainly
it
is
very
remarkable
that
in
the
midst
of
so
many
other
debates
this
double
legal
scourge
the
sorrowful
inheritance
of
the
old
world
should
be
the
only
one
which
can
and
perhaps
will
cause
the
rupture
of
the
union
indeed
a
more
astounding
fact
in
the
heart
of
society
can
not
be
conceived
than
this
that
law
should
have
become
an
instrument
of
injustice
and
if
this
fact
occasions
consequences
so
formidable
to
the
united
states
where
there
is
but
one
exception
what
must
it
be
with
us
in
europe
where
it
is
a
principle
a
system
montalembert
adopting
the
thought
of
a
famous
proclamation
of
carlier
said
we
must
make
war
against
socialism
and
by
socialism
according
to
the
definition
of
charles
dupin
he
meant
plunder
but
what
plunder
did
he
mean
for
there
are
two
sorts
extralegal
and
legal
plunder
as
to
extralegal
plunder
such
as
theft
or
swindling
which
is
defined
foreseen
and
punished
by
the
penal
code
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
adorned
by
the
name
of
socialism
it
is
not
this
that
systematically
threatens
the
foundations
of
society
besides
the
war
against
this
kind
of
plunder
has
not
waited
for
the
signal
of
montalembert
or
carlier
it
has
gone
on
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
france
was
carrying
it
on
long
before
the
revolution
of
february
long
before
the
appearance
of
socialism
with
all
the
ceremonies
of
magistracy
police
gendarmerie
prisons
dungeons
and
scaffolds
it
is
the
law
itself
that
is
conducting
this
war
and
it
is
to
be
wished
in
my
opinion
that
the
law
should
always
maintain
this
attitude
with
respect
to
plunder
but
this
is
not
the
case
the
law
sometimes
takes
its
own
part
sometimes
it
accomplishes
it
with
its
own
hands
in
order
to
save
the
parties
benefited
the
shame
the
danger
and
the
scruple
sometimes
it
places
all
this
ceremony
of
magistracy
police
gendarmerie
and
prisons
at
the
service
of
the
plunderer
and
treats
the
plundered
party
when
he
defends
himself
as
the
criminal
in
a
word
there
is
a
legal
plunder
and
it
is
no
doubt
this
that
is
meant
by
montalembert
this
plunder
may
be
only
an
exceptional
blemish
in
the
legislation
of
a
people
and
in
this
case
the
best
thing
that
can
be
done
is
without
so
many
speeches
and
lamentations
to
do
away
with
it
as
soon
as
possible
notwithstanding
the
clamors
of
interested
parties
but
how
is
it
to
be
distinguished
very
easily
see
whether
the
law
takes
from
some
persons
that
which
belongs
to
them
to
give
to
others
what
does
not
belong
to
them
see
whether
the
law
performs
for
the
profit
of
one
citizen
and
to
the
injury
of
others
an
act
that
this
citizen
can
not
perform
without
committing
a
crime
abolish
this
law
without
delay
it
is
not
merely
an
iniquity
it
is
a
fertile
source
of
iniquities
for
it
invites
reprisals
and
if
you
do
not
take
care
the
exceptional
case
will
extend
multiply
and
become
systematic
no
doubt
the
party
benefited
will
exclaim
loudly
he
will
assert
his
acquired
rights
he
will
say
that
the
state
is
bound
to
protect
and
encourage
his
industry
he
will
plead
that
it
is
a
good
thing
for
the
state
to
be
enriched
that
it
may
spend
the
more
and
thus
shower
down
salaries
upon
the
poor
workmen
take
care
not
to
listen
to
this
sophistry
for
it
is
just
by
the
systematizing
of
these
arguments
that
legal
plunder
becomes
systematized
and
this
is
what
has
taken
place
the
delusion
of
the
day
is
to
enrich
all
classes
at
the
expense
of
each
other
it
is
to
generalize
plunder
under
pretense
of
organizing
it
now
legal
plunder
may
be
exercised
in
an
infinite
multitude
of
ways
hence
come
an
infinite
multitude
of
plans
for
organization
tariffs
protection
perquisites
gratuities
encouragements
progressive
taxation
free
public
education
right
to
work
right
to
profit
right
to
wages
right
to
assistance
right
to
instruments
of
labor
gratuity
of
credit
etc
and
it
is
all
these
plans
taken
as
a
whole
with
what
they
have
in
common
legal
plunder
that
takes
the
name
of
socialism
now
socialism
thus
defined
and
forming
a
doctrinal
body
what
other
war
would
you
make
against
it
than
a
war
of
doctrine
you
find
this
doctrine
false
absurd
abominable
refute
it
this
will
be
all
the
easier
the
more
false
absurd
and
abominable
it
is
above
all
if
you
wish
to
be
strong
begin
by
rooting
out
of
your
legislation
every
particle
of
socialism
which
may
have
crept
into
it
and
this
will
be
no
light
work
montalembert
has
been
reproached
with
wishing
to
turn
brute
force
against
socialism
he
ought
to
be
exonerated
from
this
reproach
for
he
has
plainly
said
the
war
that
we
must
make
against
socialism
must
be
one
that
is
compatible
with
the
law
honor
and
justice
but
how
is
it
that
montalembert
does
not
see
that
he
is
placing
himself
in
a
vicious
circle
you
would
oppose
law
to
socialism
but
it
is
the
law
that
socialism
invokes
it
aspires
to
legal
not
extralegal
plunder
it
is
of
the
law
itself
like
monopolists
of
all
kinds
that
it
wants
to
make
an
instrument
and
when
once
it
has
the
law
on
its
side
how
will
you
be
able
to
turn
the
law
against
it
how
will
you
place
it
under
the
power
of
your
tribunals
your
gendarmes
and
of
your
prisons
what
will
you
do
then
you
wish
to
prevent
it
from
taking
any
part
in
the
making
of
laws
you
would
keep
it
outside
the
legislative
palace
in
this
you
will
not
succeed
i
venture
to
prophesy
so
long
as
legal
plunder
is
the
basis
of
the
legislation
within
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
this
question
of
legal
plunder
should
be
determined
and
there
are
only
three
solutions
of
it
when
the
few
plunder
the
many
when
everybody
plunders
everybody
else
when
nobody
plunders
anybody
partial
plunder
universal
plunder
absence
of
plunder
amongst
these
we
have
to
make
our
choice
the
law
can
only
produce
one
of
these
results
partial
plunder
this
is
the
system
that
prevailed
so
long
as
the
elective
privilege
was
partial
a
system
that
is
resorted
to
to
avoid
the
invasion
of
socialism
universal
plunder
we
have
been
threatened
by
this
system
when
the
elective
privilege
has
become
universal
the
masses
having
conceived
the
idea
of
making
law
on
the
principle
of
legislators
who
had
preceded
them
absence
of
plunder
this
is
the
principle
of
justice
peace
order
stability
conciliation
and
of
good
sense
which
i
shall
proclaim
with
all
the
force
of
my
lungs
which
is
very
inadequate
alas
till
the
day
of
my
death
and
in
all
sincerity
can
anything
more
be
required
at
the
hands
of
the
law
can
the
law
whose
necessary
sanction
is
force
be
reasonably
employed
upon
anything
beyond
securing
to
every
one
his
right
i
defy
anyone
to
remove
it
from
this
circle
without
perverting
it
and
consequently
turning
force
against
right
and
as
this
is
the
most
fatal
the
most
illogical
social
perversion
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
true
solution
so
much
sought
after
of
the
social
problem
is
contained
in
these
simple
words
law
is
organized
justice
now
it
is
important
to
remark
that
to
organize
justice
by
law
that
is
to
say
by
force
excludes
the
idea
of
organizing
by
law
or
by
force
any
manifestation
whatever
of
human
activity
labor
charity
agriculture
commerce
industry
instruction
the
fine
arts
or
religion
for
any
one
of
these
organizings
would
inevitably
destroy
the
essential
organization
how
in
fact
can
we
imagine
force
encroaching
upon
the
liberty
of
citizens
without
infringing
upon
justice
and
so
acting
against
its
proper
aim
here
i
am
taking
on
the
most
popular
prejudice
of
our
time
it
is
not
considered
enough
that
law
should
be
just
it
must
be
philanthropic
it
is
not
sufficient
that
it
should
guarantee
to
every
citizen
the
free
and
inoffensive
exercise
of
his
faculties
applied
to
his
physical
intellectual
and
moral
development
it
is
required
to
extend
instruction
and
morality
directly
over
the
nation
this
is
the
fascinating
side
of
socialism
but
i
repeat
it
these
two
missions
of
the
law
contradict
each
other
we
have
to
choose
between
them
a
citizen
can
not
at
the
same
time
be
free
and
not
free
de
lamartine
wrote
to
me
one
day
thus
your
doctrine
is
only
the
half
of
my
program
you
have
stopped
at
liberty
i
go
on
to
fraternity
i
answered
him
the
second
part
of
your
program
will
destroy
the
first
and
in
fact
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
separate
the
word
fraternity
from
the
word
voluntary
i
can
not
possibly
conceive
fraternity
legally
enforced
without
liberty
being
legally
destroyed
and
justice
legally
trampled
under
foot
legal
plunder
has
two
roots
one
of
them
as
we
have
already
seen
is
in
human
greed
the
other
is
in
misconceived
philanthropy
before
i
proceed
i
think
i
ought
to
explain
myself
upon
the
word
plunder
i
do
not
take
it
as
it
often
is
taken
in
a
vague
undefined
relative
or
metaphorical
sense
i
use
it
in
its
scientific
acceptation
and
as
expressing
the
opposite
idea
to
property
when
a
portion
of
wealth
passes
out
of
the
hands
of
him
who
has
acquired
it
without
his
consent
and
without
compensation
to
him
who
has
not
created
it
whether
by
force
or
by
artifice
i
say
that
property
is
violated
that
plunder
is
perpetrated
i
say
that
this
is
exactly
what
the
law
ought
to
repress
always
and
everywhere
if
the
law
itself
performs
the
action
it
ought
to
repress
i
say
that
plunder
is
still
perpetrated
and
even
in
a
social
point
of
view
under
aggravated
circumstances
in
this
case
however
he
who
profits
from
the
plunder
is
not
responsible
for
it
it
is
the
law
the
lawgiver
society
itself
and
this
is
where
the
political
danger
lies
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
there
is
something
offensive
in
the
word
i
have
sought
in
vain
for
another
for
i
would
not
wish
at
any
time
and
especially
just
now
to
add
an
irritating
word
to
our
disagreements
therefore
whether
i
am
believed
or
not
i
declare
that
i
do
not
mean
to
impugn
the
intentions
nor
the
morality
of
anybody
i
am
attacking
an
idea
that
i
believe
to
be
false
a
system
that
appears
to
me
to
be
unjust
and
this
is
so
independent
of
intentions
that
each
of
us
profits
by
it
without
wishing
it
and
suffers
from
it
without
being
aware
of
the
cause
any
person
must
write
under
the
influence
of
party
spirit
or
of
fear
who
would
call
into
question
the
sincerity
of
protectionism
of
socialism
and
even
of
communism
which
are
one
and
the
same
plant
in
three
different
periods
of
its
growth
all
that
can
be
said
is
that
plunder
is
more
visible
by
its
partiality
in
protectionism
and
by
its
universality
in
communism
whence
it
follows
that
of
the
three
systems
socialism
is
still
the
most
vague
the
most
undefined
and
consequently
the
most
sincere
be
that
as
it
may
to
conclude
that
legal
plunder
has
one
of
its
roots
in
misconceived
philanthropy
is
evidently
to
put
intentions
out
of
the
question
with
this
understanding
let
us
examine
the
value
the
origin
and
the
tendency
of
this
popular
aspiration
which
pretends
to
realize
the
general
good
by
general
plunder
the
socialists
say
since
the
law
organizes
justice
why
should
it
not
organize
labor
instruction
and
religion
why
because
it
could
not
organize
labor
instruction
and
religion
without
disorganizing
justice
for
remember
that
law
is
force
and
that
consequently
the
domain
of
the
law
can
not
properly
extend
beyond
the
domain
of
force
when
law
and
force
keep
a
man
within
the
bounds
of
justice
they
impose
nothing
upon
him
but
a
mere
negation
they
only
oblige
him
to
abstain
from
doing
harm
they
violate
neither
his
personality
his
liberty
nor
his
property
they
only
guard
the
personality
the
liberty
the
property
of
others
they
hold
themselves
on
the
defensive
they
defend
the
equal
right
of
all
they
fulfill
a
mission
whose
harmlessness
is
evident
whose
utility
is
palpable
and
whose
legitimacy
is
not
to
be
disputed
this
is
so
true
that
as
a
friend
of
mine
once
remarked
to
me
to
say
that
the
aim
of
the
law
is
to
cause
justice
to
reign
is
to
use
an
expression
that
is
not
rigorously
exact
it
ought
to
be
said
the
aim
of
the
law
is
to
prevent
injustice
from
reigning
in
fact
it
is
not
justice
that
has
an
existence
of
its
own
it
is
injustice
the
one
results
from
the
absence
of
the
other
but
when
the
law
through
the
medium
of
its
necessary
agent
force
imposes
a
form
of
labor
a
method
or
a
subject
of
instruction
a
creed
or
a
worship
it
is
no
longer
negative
it
acts
positively
upon
men
it
substitutes
the
will
of
the
legislator
for
their
own
will
the
initiative
of
the
legislator
for
their
own
initiative
they
have
no
need
to
consult
to
compare
or
to
foresee
the
law
does
all
that
for
them
the
intellect
is
for
them
a
useless
encumbrance
they
cease
to
be
men
they
lose
their
personality
their
liberty
their
property
try
to
imagine
a
form
of
labor
imposed
by
force
that
is
not
a
violation
of
liberty
a
transmission
of
wealth
imposed
by
force
that
is
not
a
violation
of
property
if
you
can
not
succeed
in
reconciling
this
you
are
bound
to
conclude
that
the
law
can
not
organize
labor
and
industry
without
organizing
injustice
when
from
the
seclusion
of
his
office
a
politician
takes
a
view
of
society
he
is
struck
with
the
spectacle
of
inequality
that
presents
itself
he
mourns
over
the
sufferings
that
are
the
lot
of
so
many
of
our
brethren
sufferings
whose
aspect
is
rendered
yet
more
sorrowful
by
the
contrast
of
luxury
and
wealth
he
ought
perhaps
to
ask
himself
whether
such
a
social
state
has
not
been
caused
by
the
plunder
of
ancient
times
exercised
in
the
way
of
conquests
and
by
plunder
of
more
recent
times
effected
through
the
medium
of
the
laws
he
ought
to
ask
himself
whether
granting
the
aspiration
of
all
men
to
and
improvement
the
reign
of
justice
would
not
suffice
to
realize
the
greatest
activity
of
progress
and
the
greatest
amount
of
equality
compatible
with
that
individual
responsibility
that
god
has
awarded
as
a
just
retribution
of
virtue
and
vice
he
never
gives
this
a
thought
his
mind
turns
towards
combinations
arrangements
legal
or
factitious
organizations
he
seeks
the
remedy
in
perpetuating
and
exaggerating
what
has
produced
the
evil
for
justice
apart
which
we
have
seen
is
only
a
negation
is
there
any
one
of
these
legal
arrangements
that
does
not
contain
the
principle
of
plunder
you
say
there
are
men
who
have
no
money
and
you
apply
to
the
law
but
the
law
is
not
a
fountain
whence
every
stream
may
obtain
supplies
independently
of
society
nothing
can
enter
the
public
treasury
in
favor
of
one
citizen
or
one
class
but
what
other
citizens
and
other
classes
have
been
forced
to
send
to
it
if
everyone
draws
from
it
only
the
equivalent
of
what
he
has
contributed
to
it
your
law
it
is
true
is
no
plunderer
but
it
does
nothing
for
men
who
want
money
it
does
not
promote
equality
it
can
only
be
an
instrument
of
equalization
as
far
as
it
takes
from
one
party
to
give
to
another
and
then
it
is
an
instrument
of
plunder
examine
in
this
light
the
protection
of
tariffs
subsidies
right
to
profit
right
to
labor
right
to
assistance
free
public
education
progressive
taxation
gratuitousness
of
credit
social
workshops
and
you
will
always
find
at
the
bottom
legal
plunder
organized
injustice
you
say
there
are
men
who
want
knowledge
and
you
apply
to
the
law
but
the
law
is
not
a
torch
that
sheds
light
that
originates
within
itself
it
extends
over
a
society
where
there
are
men
who
have
knowledge
and
others
who
have
not
citizens
who
want
to
learn
and
others
who
are
disposed
to
teach
it
can
only
do
one
of
two
things
either
allow
a
free
operation
to
this
kind
of
transaction
let
this
kind
of
want
satisfy
itself
freely
or
else
preempt
the
will
of
the
people
in
the
matter
and
take
from
some
of
them
sufficient
to
pay
professors
commissioned
to
instruct
others
for
free
but
in
this
second
case
there
can
not
fail
to
be
a
violation
of
liberty
and
property
legal
plunder
you
say
here
are
men
who
are
wanting
in
morality
or
religion
and
you
apply
to
the
law
but
law
is
force
and
need
i
say
how
far
it
is
a
violent
and
absurd
enterprise
to
introduce
force
in
these
matters
as
the
result
of
its
systems
and
of
its
efforts
it
would
seem
that
socialism
notwithstanding
all
its
can
scarcely
help
perceiving
the
monster
of
legal
plunder
but
what
does
it
do
it
disguises
it
cleverly
from
others
and
even
from
itself
under
the
seductive
names
of
fraternity
solidarity
organization
association
and
because
we
do
not
ask
so
much
at
the
hands
of
the
law
because
we
only
ask
it
for
justice
it
alleges
that
we
reject
fraternity
solidarity
organization
and
association
and
they
brand
us
with
the
name
of
individualists
we
can
assure
them
that
what
we
repudiate
is
not
natural
organization
but
forced
organization
it
is
not
free
association
but
the
forms
of
association
that
they
would
impose
upon
us
it
is
not
spontaneous
fraternity
but
legal
fraternity
it
is
not
providential
solidarity
but
artificial
solidarity
which
is
only
an
unjust
displacement
of
responsibility
socialism
like
the
old
policy
from
which
it
emanates
confounds
government
and
society
and
so
every
time
we
object
to
a
thing
being
done
by
government
it
concludes
that
we
object
to
its
being
done
at
all
we
disapprove
of
education
by
the
state
then
we
are
against
education
altogether
we
object
to
a
state
religion
then
we
would
have
no
religion
at
all
we
object
to
an
equality
which
is
brought
about
by
the
state
then
we
are
against
equality
etc
they
might
as
well
accuse
us
of
wishing
men
not
to
eat
because
we
object
to
the
cultivation
of
corn
by
the
state
how
is
it
that
the
strange
idea
of
making
the
law
produce
what
it
does
not
contain
prosperity
in
a
positive
sense
wealth
science
religion
should
ever
have
gained
ground
in
the
political
world
the
modern
politicians
particularly
those
of
the
socialist
school
found
their
different
theories
upon
one
common
hypothesis
and
surely
a
more
strange
a
more
presumptuous
notion
could
never
have
entered
a
human
brain
they
divide
mankind
into
two
parts
men
in
general
except
one
form
the
first
the
politician
himself
forms
the
second
which
is
by
far
the
most
important
in
fact
they
begin
by
supposing
that
men
are
devoid
of
any
principle
of
action
and
of
any
means
of
discernment
in
themselves
that
they
have
no
initiative
that
they
are
inert
matter
passive
particles
atoms
without
impulse
at
best
a
vegetation
indifferent
to
its
own
mode
of
existence
susceptible
of
assuming
from
an
exterior
will
and
hand
an
infinite
number
of
forms
more
or
less
symmetrical
artistic
and
perfected
moreover
every
one
of
these
politicians
does
not
hesitate
to
assume
that
he
himself
is
under
the
names
of
organizer
discoverer
legislator
institutor
or
founder
this
will
and
hand
this
universal
initiative
this
creative
power
whose
sublime
mission
it
is
to
gather
together
these
scattered
materials
that
is
men
into
society
starting
from
these
data
as
a
gardener
according
to
his
caprice
shapes
his
trees
into
pyramids
parasols
cubes
cones
vases
espaliers
distaffs
or
fans
so
the
socialist
following
his
chimera
shapes
poor
humanity
into
groups
series
circles
subcircles
honeycombs
or
social
workshops
with
all
kinds
of
variations
and
as
the
gardener
to
bring
his
trees
into
shape
needs
hatchets
pruning
hooks
saws
and
shears
so
the
politician
to
bring
society
into
shape
needs
the
forces
which
he
can
only
find
in
the
laws
the
law
of
tariffs
the
law
of
taxation
the
law
of
assistance
and
the
law
of
education
it
is
so
true
that
the
socialists
look
upon
mankind
as
a
subject
for
social
experiments
that
if
by
chance
they
are
not
quite
certain
of
the
success
of
these
experiments
they
will
request
a
portion
of
mankind
as
a
subject
to
experiment
upon
it
is
well
known
how
popular
the
idea
of
trying
all
systems
is
and
one
of
their
chiefs
has
been
known
seriously
to
demand
of
the
constituent
assembly
a
parish
with
all
its
inhabitants
upon
which
to
make
his
experiments
it
is
thus
that
an
inventor
will
make
a
small
machine
before
he
makes
one
of
the
regular
size
thus
the
chemist
sacrifices
some
substances
the
agriculturist
some
seed
and
a
corner
of
his
field
to
make
trial
of
an
idea
but
think
of
the
difference
between
the
gardener
and
his
trees
between
the
inventor
and
his
machine
between
the
chemist
and
his
substances
between
the
agriculturist
and
his
seed
the
socialist
thinks
in
all
sincerity
that
there
is
the
same
difference
between
himself
and
mankind
no
wonder
the
politicians
of
the
nineteenth
century
look
upon
society
as
an
artificial
production
of
the
legislator
genius
this
idea
the
result
of
a
classical
education
has
taken
possession
of
all
the
thinkers
and
great
writers
of
our
country
to
all
these
persons
the
relations
between
mankind
and
the
legislator
appear
to
be
the
same
as
those
that
exist
between
the
clay
and
the
potter
moreover
if
they
have
consented
to
recognize
in
the
heart
of
man
a
capability
of
action
and
in
his
intellect
a
faculty
of
discernment
they
have
looked
upon
this
gift
of
god
as
a
fatal
one
and
thought
that
mankind
under
these
two
impulses
tended
fatally
towards
ruin
they
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
if
abandoned
to
their
own
inclinations
men
would
only
occupy
themselves
with
religion
to
arrive
at
atheism
with
instruction
to
come
to
ignorance
and
with
labor
and
exchange
to
be
extinguished
in
misery
happily
according
to
these
writers
there
are
some
men
termed
governors
and
legislators
upon
whom
heaven
has
bestowed
opposite
tendencies
not
for
their
own
sake
only
but
for
the
sake
of
the
rest
of
the
world
whilst
mankind
tends
to
evil
they
incline
to
good
whilst
mankind
is
advancing
towards
darkness
they
are
aspiring
to
enlightenment
whilst
mankind
is
drawn
towards
vice
they
are
attracted
by
virtue
and
this
granted
they
demand
the
assistance
of
force
by
means
of
which
they
are
to
substitute
their
own
tendencies
for
those
of
the
human
race
it
is
only
needful
to
open
almost
at
random
a
book
on
philosophy
politics
or
history
to
see
how
strongly
this
idea
the
child
of
classical
studies
and
the
mother
of
socialism
is
rooted
in
our
country
that
mankind
is
merely
inert
matter
receiving
life
organization
morality
and
wealth
from
power
or
rather
and
still
worse
that
mankind
itself
tends
towards
degradation
and
is
only
arrested
in
its
tendency
by
the
mysterious
hand
of
the
legislator
classical
conventionalism
shows
us
everywhere
behind
passive
society
a
hidden
power
under
the
names
of
law
or
legislator
or
by
a
mode
of
expression
which
refers
to
some
person
or
persons
of
undisputed
weight
and
authority
but
not
named
which
moves
animates
enriches
and
regenerates
mankind
we
will
give
a
quotation
from
bossuet
one
of
the
things
which
was
the
most
strongly
impressed
by
whom
upon
the
mind
of
the
egyptians
was
the
love
of
their
country
nobody
was
allowed
to
be
useless
to
the
state
the
law
assigned
to
every
one
his
employment
which
descended
from
father
to
son
no
one
was
permitted
to
have
two
professions
nor
to
adopt
another
but
there
was
one
occupation
which
was
obliged
to
be
common
to
all
this
was
the
study
of
the
laws
and
of
wisdom
ignorance
of
religion
and
the
political
regulations
of
the
country
was
excused
in
no
condition
of
life
moreover
every
profession
had
a
district
assigned
to
it
by
whom
amongst
good
laws
one
of
the
best
things
was
that
everybody
was
taught
to
observe
them
by
whom
egypt
abounded
with
wonderful
inventions
and
nothing
was
neglected
which
could
render
life
comfortable
and
tranquil
thus
men
according
to
bossuet
derive
nothing
from
themselves
patriotism
wealth
inventions
husbandry
science
all
come
to
them
by
the
operation
of
the
laws
or
by
kings
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
be
passive
it
is
on
this
ground
that
bossuet
takes
exception
when
diodorus
accuses
the
egyptians
of
rejecting
wrestling
and
music
how
is
that
possible
says
he
since
these
arts
were
invented
by
trismegistus
it
is
the
same
with
the
persians
one
of
the
first
cares
of
the
prince
was
to
encourage
agriculture
as
there
were
posts
established
for
the
regulation
of
the
armies
so
there
were
offices
for
the
superintending
of
rural
works
the
respect
with
which
the
persians
were
inspired
for
royal
authority
was
excessive
the
greeks
although
full
of
mind
were
no
less
strangers
to
their
own
responsibilities
so
much
so
that
of
themselves
like
dogs
and
horses
they
would
not
have
ventured
upon
the
most
simple
games
in
a
classical
sense
it
is
an
undisputed
thing
that
everything
comes
to
the
people
from
without
the
greeks
naturally
full
of
spirit
and
courage
had
been
early
cultivated
by
kings
and
colonies
who
had
come
from
egypt
from
them
they
had
learned
the
exercises
of
the
body
foot
races
and
horse
and
chariot
races
the
best
thing
that
the
egyptians
had
taught
them
was
to
become
docile
and
to
allow
themselves
to
be
formed
by
the
laws
for
the
public
good
fenelon
reared
in
the
study
and
admiration
of
antiquity
and
a
witness
of
the
power
of
louis
xiv
fenelon
naturally
adopted
the
idea
that
mankind
should
be
passive
and
that
its
misfortunes
and
its
prosperities
its
virtues
and
its
vices
are
caused
by
the
external
influence
that
is
exercised
upon
it
by
the
law
or
by
the
makers
of
the
law
thus
in
his
utopia
of
salentum
he
brings
the
men
with
their
interests
their
faculties
their
desires
and
their
possessions
under
the
absolute
direction
of
the
legislator
whatever
the
subject
may
be
they
themselves
have
no
voice
in
it
the
prince
judges
for
them
the
nation
is
just
a
shapeless
mass
of
which
the
prince
is
the
soul
in
him
resides
the
thought
the
foresight
the
principle
of
all
organization
of
all
progress
on
him
therefore
rests
all
the
responsibility
in
proof
of
this
assertion
i
might
transcribe
the
whole
of
the
tenth
book
of
i
refer
the
reader
to
it
and
shall
content
myself
with
quoting
some
passages
taken
at
random
from
this
celebrated
work
to
which
in
every
other
respect
i
am
the
first
to
render
justice
with
the
astonishing
credulity
that
characterizes
the
classics
fénelon
against
the
authority
of
reason
and
of
facts
admits
the
general
felicity
of
the
egyptians
and
attributes
it
not
to
their
own
wisdom
but
to
that
of
their
kings
we
could
not
turn
our
eyes
to
the
two
shores
without
perceiving
rich
towns
and
country
seats
agreeably
situated
fields
that
were
covered
every
year
without
intermission
with
golden
crops
meadows
full
of
flocks
laborers
bending
under
the
weight
of
fruits
that
the
earth
lavished
on
its
cultivators
and
shepherds
who
made
the
echoes
around
repeat
the
soft
sounds
of
their
pipes
and
flutes
happy
said
mentor
is
that
people
who
is
governed
by
a
wise
mentor
afterwards
desired
me
to
remark
the
happiness
and
abundance
that
was
spread
over
all
the
country
of
egypt
where
thousand
cities
might
be
counted
he
admired
the
excellent
police
regulations
of
the
cities
the
justice
administered
in
favor
of
the
poor
against
the
rich
the
good
education
of
the
children
who
were
accustomed
to
obedience
labor
and
the
love
of
arts
and
letters
the
exactness
with
which
all
the
ceremonies
of
religion
were
performed
the
disinterestedness
the
desire
of
honor
the
fidelity
to
men
and
the
fear
of
the
gods
with
which
every
father
inspired
his
children
he
could
not
sufficiently
admire
the
prosperous
state
of
the
country
happy
said
he
is
the
people
whom
a
wise
king
rules
in
such
a
manner
fénelon
idyll
on
crete
is
still
more
fascinating
mentor
is
made
to
say
all
that
you
will
see
in
this
wonderful
island
is
the
result
of
the
laws
of
minos
the
education
that
the
children
receive
renders
the
body
healthy
and
robust
they
are
accustomed
from
the
first
to
a
frugal
and
laborious
life
it
is
supposed
that
all
the
pleasures
of
sense
enervate
the
body
and
the
mind
no
other
pleasure
is
presented
to
them
but
that
of
being
invincible
by
virtue
that
of
acquiring
much
glory
there
they
punish
three
vices
that
go
unpunished
amongst
other
people
ingratitude
dissimulation
and
avarice
as
to
pomp
and
dissipation
there
is
no
need
to
punish
these
for
they
are
unknown
in
crete
no
costly
furniture
no
magnificent
clothing
no
delicious
feasts
no
gilded
palaces
are
allowed
it
is
thus
that
mentor
prepares
his
scholar
to
mould
and
manipulate
doubtless
with
the
most
philanthropic
intentions
the
people
of
ithaca
and
to
confirm
him
in
these
ideas
he
gives
him
the
example
of
salentum
so
we
receive
our
first
political
notions
we
are
taught
to
treat
men
very
much
as
oliver
de
serres
teaches
farmers
to
manage
and
to
mix
the
soil
montesquieu
to
sustain
the
spirit
of
commerce
it
is
necessary
that
all
the
laws
should
favor
it
that
these
same
laws
by
their
regulations
in
dividing
the
fortunes
in
proportion
as
commerce
enlarges
them
should
place
every
poor
citizen
in
sufficiently
easy
circumstances
to
enable
him
to
work
like
the
others
and
every
rich
citizen
in
such
mediocrity
that
he
must
work
in
order
to
retain
or
to
acquire
thus
the
laws
are
to
dispose
of
all
fortunes
although
in
a
democracy
real
equality
be
the
soul
of
the
state
yet
it
is
so
difficult
to
establish
that
an
extreme
exactness
in
this
matter
would
not
always
be
desirable
it
is
sufficient
that
a
census
be
established
to
reduce
or
fix
the
differences
to
a
certain
point
after
which
it
is
for
particular
laws
to
equalize
as
it
were
the
inequality
by
burdens
imposed
upon
the
rich
and
reliefs
granted
to
the
poor
here
again
we
see
the
equalization
of
fortunes
by
law
that
is
by
force
there
were
in
greece
two
kinds
of
republics
one
was
military
as
sparta
the
other
commercial
as
athens
in
the
one
it
was
wished
by
whom
that
the
citizens
should
be
idle
in
the
other
the
love
of
labor
was
encouraged
it
is
worth
our
while
to
pay
a
little
attention
to
the
extent
of
genius
required
by
these
legislators
that
we
may
see
how
by
confounding
all
the
virtues
they
showed
their
wisdom
to
the
world
lycurgus
blending
theft
with
the
spirit
of
justice
the
hardest
slavery
with
extreme
liberty
the
most
atrocious
sentiments
with
the
greatest
moderation
gave
stability
to
his
city
he
seemed
to
deprive
it
of
all
its
resources
arts
commerce
money
and
walls
there
was
ambition
without
the
hope
of
rising
there
were
natural
sentiments
where
the
individual
was
neither
child
nor
husband
nor
father
chastity
even
was
deprived
of
modesty
by
this
road
sparta
was
led
on
to
grandeur
and
to
glory
the
phenomenon
that
we
observe
in
the
institutions
of
greece
has
been
seen
in
the
midst
of
the
degeneracy
and
corruption
of
our
modern
times
an
honest
legislator
has
formed
a
people
where
probity
has
appeared
as
natural
as
bravery
among
the
spartans
penn
is
a
true
lycurgus
and
although
the
former
had
peace
for
his
object
and
the
latter
war
they
resemble
each
other
in
the
singular
path
along
which
they
have
led
their
people
in
their
influence
over
free
men
in
the
prejudices
which
they
have
overcome
the
passions
they
have
subdued
paraguay
furnishes
us
with
another
example
society
has
been
accused
of
the
crime
of
regarding
the
pleasure
of
commanding
as
the
only
good
of
life
but
it
will
always
be
a
noble
thing
to
govern
men
by
making
them
happy
those
who
desire
to
form
similar
institutions
will
establish
community
of
property
as
in
the
republic
of
plato
the
same
reverence
as
he
enjoined
for
the
gods
separation
from
strangers
for
the
preservation
of
morality
and
make
the
city
and
not
the
citizens
create
commerce
they
should
give
our
arts
without
our
luxury
our
wants
without
our
desires
vulgar
infatuation
may
exclaim
if
it
likes
it
is
montesquieu
magnificent
sublime
i
am
not
afraid
to
express
my
opinion
and
to
say
what
you
have
the
gall
to
call
that
fine
it
is
frightful
it
is
abominable
and
these
extracts
which
i
might
multiply
show
that
according
to
montesquieu
the
persons
the
liberties
the
property
mankind
itself
are
nothing
but
grist
for
the
mill
of
the
sagacity
of
lawgivers
rousseau
although
this
politician
the
paramount
authority
of
the
democrats
makes
the
social
edifice
rest
upon
the
general
will
no
one
has
so
completely
admitted
the
hypothesis
of
the
entire
passiveness
of
human
nature
in
the
presence
of
the
lawgiver
if
it
is
true
that
a
great
prince
is
a
rare
thing
how
much
more
so
must
a
great
lawgiver
be
the
former
has
only
to
follow
the
pattern
proposed
to
him
by
the
latter
this
latter
is
the
engineer
who
invents
the
machine
the
former
is
merely
the
workman
who
sets
it
in
motion
and
what
part
have
men
to
act
in
all
this
that
of
the
machine
which
is
set
in
motion
or
rather
are
they
not
the
brute
matter
of
which
the
machine
is
made
thus
between
the
legislator
and
the
prince
between
the
prince
and
his
subjects
there
are
the
same
relations
as
those
that
exist
between
the
agricultural
writer
and
the
agriculturist
the
agriculturist
and
the
clod
at
what
a
vast
height
then
is
the
politician
placed
who
rules
over
legislators
themselves
and
teaches
them
their
trade
in
such
imperative
terms
as
the
following
would
you
give
consistency
to
the
state
bring
the
extremes
together
as
much
as
possible
suffer
neither
wealthy
persons
nor
beggars
if
the
soil
is
poor
and
barren
or
the
country
too
much
confined
for
the
inhabitants
turn
to
industry
and
the
arts
whose
productions
you
will
exchange
for
the
provisions
which
you
require
on
a
good
soil
if
you
are
short
of
inhabitants
give
all
your
attention
to
agriculture
which
multiplies
men
and
banish
the
arts
which
only
serve
to
depopulate
the
country
pay
attention
to
extensive
and
convenient
coasts
cover
the
sea
with
vessels
and
you
will
have
a
brilliant
and
short
existence
if
your
seas
wash
only
inaccessible
rocks
let
the
people
be
barbarous
and
eat
fish
they
will
live
more
quietly
perhaps
better
and
most
certainly
more
happily
in
short
besides
those
maxims
which
are
common
to
all
every
people
has
its
own
particular
circumstances
which
demand
a
legislation
peculiar
to
itself
it
was
thus
that
the
hebrews
formerly
and
the
arabs
more
recently
had
religion
for
their
principal
object
that
of
the
athenians
was
literature
that
of
carthage
and
tyre
commerce
of
rhodes
naval
affairs
of
sparta
war
and
of
rome
virtue
the
author
of
the
spirit
of
laws
has
shown
the
art
by
which
the
legislator
should
frame
his
institutions
towards
each
of
these
objects
but
if
the
legislator
mistaking
his
object
should
take
up
a
principle
different
from
that
which
arises
from
the
nature
of
things
if
one
should
tend
to
slavery
and
the
other
to
liberty
if
one
to
wealth
and
the
other
to
population
one
to
peace
and
the
other
to
conquests
the
laws
will
insensibly
become
enfeebled
the
constitution
will
be
impaired
and
the
state
will
be
subject
to
incessant
agitations
until
it
is
destroyed
or
becomes
changed
and
invincible
nature
regains
her
empire
but
if
nature
is
sufficiently
invincible
to
regain
its
empire
why
does
not
rousseau
admit
that
it
had
no
need
of
the
legislator
to
gain
its
empire
from
the
beginning
why
does
he
not
allow
that
by
obeying
their
own
impulse
men
would
of
themselves
apply
agriculture
to
a
fertile
district
and
commerce
to
extensive
and
commodious
coasts
without
the
interference
of
a
lycurgus
a
solon
or
a
rousseau
who
would
undertake
it
at
the
risk
of
deceiving
themselves
be
that
as
it
may
we
see
with
what
a
terrible
responsibility
rousseau
invests
inventors
institutors
conductors
and
manipulators
of
societies
he
is
therefore
very
exacting
with
regard
to
them
he
who
dares
to
undertake
the
institutions
of
a
people
ought
to
feel
that
he
can
as
it
were
transform
every
individual
who
is
by
himself
a
perfect
and
solitary
whole
receiving
his
life
and
being
from
a
larger
whole
of
which
he
forms
a
part
he
must
feel
that
he
can
change
the
constitution
of
man
to
fortify
it
and
substitute
a
social
and
moral
existence
for
the
physical
and
independent
one
that
we
have
all
received
from
nature
in
a
word
he
must
deprive
man
of
his
own
powers
to
give
him
others
that
are
foreign
to
him
poor
human
nature
what
would
become
of
its
dignity
if
it
were
entrusted
to
the
disciples
of
rousseau
raynal
the
climate
that
is
the
air
and
the
soil
is
the
first
element
for
the
legislator
his
resources
prescribe
to
him
his
duties
first
he
must
consult
his
local
position
a
population
dwelling
upon
maritime
shores
must
have
laws
fitted
for
navigation
if
the
colony
is
located
in
an
inland
region
a
legislator
must
provide
for
the
nature
of
the
soil
and
for
its
degree
of
fertility
it
is
more
especially
in
the
distribution
of
property
that
the
wisdom
of
legislation
will
appear
as
a
general
rule
and
in
every
country
when
a
new
colony
is
founded
land
should
be
given
to
each
man
sufficient
for
the
support
of
his
family
in
an
uncultivated
island
which
you
are
colonizing
with
children
it
will
only
be
needful
to
let
the
germs
of
truth
expand
in
the
developments
of
reason
but
when
you
establish
old
people
in
a
new
country
the
skill
consists
in
only
allowing
it
those
injurious
opinions
and
customs
which
it
is
impossible
to
cure
and
correct
if
you
wish
to
prevent
them
from
being
perpetuated
you
will
act
upon
the
rising
generation
by
a
general
and
public
education
of
the
children
a
prince
or
legislator
ought
never
to
found
a
colony
without
previously
sending
wise
men
there
to
instruct
the
youth
in
a
new
colony
every
facility
is
open
to
the
precautions
of
the
legislator
who
desires
to
purify
the
tone
and
the
manners
of
the
people
if
he
has
genius
and
virtue
the
lands
and
the
men
that
are
at
his
disposal
will
inspire
his
soul
with
a
plan
of
society
that
a
writer
can
only
vaguely
trace
and
in
a
way
that
would
be
subject
to
the
instability
of
all
hypotheses
which
are
varied
and
complicated
by
an
infinity
of
circumstances
too
difficult
to
foresee
and
to
combine
one
would
think
it
was
a
professor
of
agriculture
who
was
saying
to
his
pupils
the
climate
is
the
only
rule
for
the
agriculturist
his
resources
dictate
to
him
his
duties
the
first
thing
he
has
to
consider
is
his
local
position
if
he
is
on
a
clayey
soil
he
must
do
so
and
so
if
he
has
to
contend
with
sand
this
is
the
way
in
which
he
must
set
about
it
every
facility
is
open
to
the
agriculturist
who
wishes
to
clear
and
improve
his
soil
if
he
only
has
the
skill
the
manure
which
he
has
at
his
disposal
will
suggest
to
him
a
plan
of
operation
which
a
professor
can
only
vaguely
trace
and
in
a
way
that
would
be
subject
to
the
uncertainty
of
all
hypotheses
which
vary
and
are
complicated
by
an
infinity
of
circumstances
too
difficult
to
foresee
and
to
combine
but
oh
sublime
writers
deign
to
remember
sometimes
that
this
clay
this
sand
this
manure
of
which
you
are
disposing
in
so
arbitrary
a
manner
are
men
your
equals
intelligent
and
free
beings
like
yourselves
who
have
received
from
god
as
you
have
the
faculty
of
seeing
of
foreseeing
of
thinking
and
of
judging
for
themselves
mably
he
is
supposing
the
laws
to
be
worn
out
by
time
and
by
the
neglect
of
security
and
continues
thus
under
these
circumstances
we
must
be
convinced
that
the
bonds
of
government
are
slack
give
them
a
new
tension
it
is
the
reader
who
is
addressed
and
the
evil
will
be
remedied
think
less
of
punishing
the
faults
than
of
encouraging
the
virtues
that
you
want
by
this
method
you
will
bestow
upon
your
republic
the
vigor
of
youth
through
ignorance
of
this
a
free
people
has
lost
its
liberty
but
if
the
evil
has
made
so
much
way
that
the
ordinary
magistrates
are
unable
to
remedy
it
effectually
have
recourse
to
an
extraordinary
magistracy
whose
time
should
be
short
and
its
power
considerable
the
imagination
of
the
citizens
requires
to
be
impressed
in
this
style
he
goes
on
through
twenty
volumes
there
was
a
time
when
under
the
influence
of
teaching
like
this
which
is
the
foundation
of
classical
education
everyone
was
for
placing
himself
beyond
and
above
mankind
for
the
sake
of
arranging
organizing
and
instituting
it
in
his
own
way
condillac
take
upon
yourself
my
lord
the
character
of
lycurgus
or
of
solon
before
you
finish
reading
this
essay
amuse
yourself
with
giving
laws
to
some
wild
people
in
america
or
in
africa
establish
these
roving
men
in
fixed
dwellings
teach
them
to
keep
flocks
endeavor
to
develop
the
social
qualities
that
nature
has
implanted
in
them
make
them
begin
to
practice
the
duties
of
humanity
cause
the
pleasures
of
the
passions
to
become
distasteful
to
them
by
punishments
and
you
will
see
these
barbarians
with
every
plan
of
your
legislation
lose
a
vice
and
gain
a
virtue
all
these
people
have
had
laws
but
few
among
them
have
been
happy
why
is
this
because
legislators
have
almost
always
been
ignorant
of
the
object
of
society
which
is
to
unite
families
by
a
common
interest
impartiality
in
law
consists
in
two
things
in
establishing
equality
in
the
fortunes
and
in
the
dignity
of
the
citizens
in
proportion
to
the
degree
of
equality
established
by
the
laws
the
dearer
will
they
become
to
every
citizen
how
can
avarice
ambition
dissipation
idleness
sloth
envy
hatred
or
jealousy
agitate
men
who
are
equal
in
fortune
and
dignity
and
to
whom
the
laws
leave
no
hope
of
disturbing
their
equality
what
has
been
told
you
of
the
republic
of
sparta
ought
to
enlighten
you
on
this
question
no
other
state
has
had
laws
more
in
accordance
with
the
order
of
nature
or
of
equality
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
should
have
looked
upon
the
human
race
as
inert
matter
ready
to
receive
everything
form
figure
impulse
movement
and
life
from
a
great
prince
or
a
great
legislator
or
a
great
genius
these
ages
were
reared
in
the
study
of
antiquity
and
antiquity
presents
everywhere
in
egypt
persia
greece
and
rome
the
spectacle
of
a
few
men
molding
mankind
according
to
their
fancy
and
mankind
to
this
end
enslaved
by
force
or
by
imposture
and
what
does
this
prove
that
because
men
and
society
are
improvable
error
ignorance
despotism
slavery
and
superstition
must
be
more
prevalent
in
early
times
the
mistake
of
the
writers
quoted
above
is
not
that
they
have
asserted
this
fact
but
that
they
have
proposed
it
as
a
rule
for
the
admiration
and
imitation
of
future
generations
their
mistake
has
been
with
an
inconceivable
absence
of
discernment
and
upon
the
faith
of
a
puerile
conventionalism
that
they
have
admitted
what
is
inadmissible
the
grandeur
dignity
morality
and
of
the
artificial
societies
of
the
ancient
world
they
have
not
understood
that
time
produces
and
spreads
enlightenment
and
that
in
proportion
to
the
increase
of
enlightenment
right
ceases
to
be
upheld
by
force
and
society
regains
possession
of
herself
and
in
fact
what
is
the
political
work
that
we
are
endeavoring
to
promote
it
is
no
other
than
the
instinctive
effort
of
every
people
towards
liberty
and
what
is
liberty
whose
name
can
make
every
heart
beat
and
which
can
agitate
the
world
but
the
union
of
all
liberties
the
liberty
of
conscience
of
education
of
association
of
the
press
of
movement
of
labor
and
of
exchange
in
other
words
the
free
exercise
for
all
of
all
the
inoffensive
faculties
and
again
in
other
words
the
destruction
of
all
despotisms
even
of
legal
despotism
and
the
reduction
of
law
to
its
only
rational
sphere
which
is
to
regulate
the
individual
right
of
legitimate
defense
or
to
repress
injustice
this
tendency
of
the
human
race
it
must
be
admitted
is
greatly
thwarted
particularly
in
our
country
by
the
fatal
disposition
resulting
from
classical
teaching
and
common
to
all
politicians
of
placing
themselves
beyond
mankind
to
arrange
organize
and
regulate
it
according
to
their
fancy
for
whilst
society
is
struggling
to
realize
liberty
the
great
men
who
place
themselves
at
its
head
imbued
with
the
principles
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
think
only
of
subjecting
it
to
the
philanthropic
despotism
of
their
social
inventions
and
making
it
bear
with
docility
according
to
the
expression
of
rousseau
the
yoke
of
public
felicity
as
pictured
in
their
own
imaginations
this
was
particularly
the
case
in
no
sooner
was
the
old
system
destroyed
than
society
was
to
be
submitted
to
other
artificial
arrangements
always
with
the
same
starting
point
the
omnipotence
of
the
law
the
legislator
commands
the
future
it
is
for
him
to
will
for
the
good
of
mankind
it
is
for
him
to
make
men
what
he
wishes
them
to
be
robespierre
the
function
of
government
is
to
direct
the
physical
and
moral
powers
of
the
nation
towards
the
object
of
its
institution
billaud
varennes
a
people
who
are
to
be
restored
to
liberty
must
be
formed
anew
ancient
prejudices
must
be
destroyed
antiquated
customs
changed
depraved
affections
corrected
inveterate
vices
eradicated
for
this
a
strong
force
and
a
vehement
impulse
will
be
necessary
citizens
the
inflexible
austerity
of
lycurgus
created
the
firm
basis
of
the
spartan
republic
the
feeble
and
trusting
disposition
of
solon
plunged
athens
into
slavery
this
parallel
contains
the
whole
science
of
government
lepelletier
considering
the
extent
of
human
degradation
i
am
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
effecting
an
entire
regeneration
of
the
race
and
if
i
may
so
express
myself
of
creating
a
new
people
men
therefore
are
nothing
but
raw
material
it
is
not
for
them
to
will
their
own
improvement
they
are
not
capable
of
it
according
to
it
is
only
the
legislator
who
is
men
are
merely
to
be
what
he
wills
that
they
should
be
according
to
robespierre
who
copies
rousseau
literally
the
legislator
is
to
begin
by
assigning
the
aim
of
the
institutions
of
the
nation
after
this
the
government
has
only
to
direct
all
its
physical
and
moral
forces
towards
this
end
all
this
time
the
nation
itself
is
to
remain
perfectly
passive
and
billaud
varennes
would
teach
us
that
it
ought
to
have
no
prejudices
affections
nor
wants
but
such
as
are
authorized
by
the
legislator
he
even
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
inflexible
austerity
of
a
man
is
the
basis
of
a
republic
we
have
seen
that
in
cases
where
the
evil
is
so
great
that
the
ordinary
magistrates
are
unable
to
remedy
it
mably
recommends
a
dictatorship
to
promote
virtue
have
recourse
says
he
to
an
extraordinary
magistracy
whose
time
shall
be
short
and
his
power
considerable
the
imagination
of
the
people
requires
to
be
impressed
this
doctrine
has
not
been
neglected
listen
to
robespierre
the
principle
of
the
republican
government
is
virtue
and
the
means
to
be
adopted
during
its
establishment
is
terror
we
want
to
substitute
in
our
country
morality
for
probity
for
honor
principles
for
customs
duties
for
decorum
the
empire
of
reason
for
the
tyranny
of
fashion
contempt
of
vice
for
contempt
of
misfortune
pride
for
insolence
greatness
of
soul
for
vanity
love
of
glory
for
love
of
money
good
people
for
good
company
merit
for
intrigue
genius
for
wit
truth
for
glitter
the
charm
of
happiness
for
the
weariness
of
pleasure
the
greatness
of
man
for
the
littleness
of
the
great
a
magnanimous
powerful
happy
people
for
one
that
is
easy
frivolous
degraded
that
is
to
say
we
would
substitute
all
the
virtues
and
miracles
of
a
republic
for
all
the
vices
and
absurdities
of
monarchy
at
what
a
vast
height
above
the
rest
of
mankind
does
robespierre
place
himself
here
and
observe
the
arrogance
with
which
he
speaks
he
is
not
content
with
expressing
a
desire
for
a
great
renovation
of
the
human
heart
he
does
not
even
expect
such
a
result
from
a
regular
government
no
he
intends
to
effect
it
himself
and
by
means
of
terror
the
object
of
the
discourse
from
which
this
puerile
and
laborious
mass
of
antithesis
is
extracted
was
to
exhibit
the
principles
of
morality
that
ought
to
direct
a
revolutionary
government
moreover
when
robespierre
asks
for
a
dictatorship
it
is
not
merely
for
the
purpose
of
repelling
a
foreign
enemy
or
of
putting
down
factions
it
is
that
he
may
establish
by
means
of
terror
and
as
a
preliminary
to
the
operation
of
the
constitution
his
own
principles
of
morality
he
pretends
to
nothing
short
of
extirpating
from
the
country
by
means
of
terror
honor
customs
decorum
fashion
vanity
the
love
of
money
good
company
intrigue
wit
luxury
and
misery
it
is
not
until
after
he
robespierre
shall
have
accomplished
these
miracles
as
he
rightly
calls
them
that
he
will
allow
the
law
to
regain
her
empire
truly
it
would
be
well
if
these
visionaries
who
think
so
much
of
themselves
and
so
little
of
mankind
who
want
to
renew
everything
would
only
be
content
with
trying
to
reform
themselves
the
task
would
be
arduous
enough
for
them
in
general
however
these
gentlemen
the
reformers
legislators
and
politicians
do
not
desire
to
exercise
an
immediate
despotism
over
mankind
no
they
are
too
moderate
and
too
philanthropic
for
that
they
only
contend
for
the
despotism
the
absolutism
the
omnipotence
of
the
law
they
aspire
only
to
make
the
law
to
show
how
universal
this
strange
disposition
has
been
in
france
i
had
need
not
only
to
have
copied
the
whole
of
the
works
of
mably
raynal
rousseau
fenelon
and
to
have
made
long
extracts
from
bossuet
and
montesquieu
but
to
have
given
the
entire
transactions
of
the
sittings
of
the
convention
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
however
but
merely
refer
the
reader
to
them
no
wonder
this
idea
suited
bonaparte
so
well
he
embraced
it
with
ardor
and
put
it
in
practice
with
energy
playing
the
part
of
a
chemist
europe
was
to
him
the
material
for
his
experiments
but
this
material
reacted
against
him
more
than
half
undeceived
bonaparte
at
helena
seemed
to
admit
that
there
is
an
initiative
in
every
people
and
he
became
less
hostile
to
liberty
yet
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
giving
this
lesson
to
his
son
in
his
will
to
govern
is
to
diffuse
morality
education
and
after
all
this
i
hardly
need
show
by
fastidious
quotations
the
opinions
of
morelly
babeuf
owen
saint
simon
and
fourier
i
shall
confine
myself
to
a
few
extracts
from
louis
blanc
book
on
the
organization
of
labor
in
our
project
society
receives
the
impulse
of
power
in
what
does
the
impulse
that
power
gives
to
society
consist
in
imposing
upon
it
the
project
of
louis
blanc
on
the
other
hand
society
is
the
human
race
the
human
race
then
is
to
receive
its
impulse
from
louis
blanc
it
is
at
liberty
to
do
so
or
not
it
will
be
said
of
course
the
human
race
is
at
liberty
to
take
advice
from
anybody
whoever
it
may
be
but
this
is
not
the
way
in
which
louis
blanc
understands
the
thing
he
means
that
his
project
should
be
converted
into
law
and
consequently
forcibly
imposed
by
power
in
our
project
the
state
has
only
to
give
a
legislation
to
labor
by
means
of
which
the
industrial
movement
may
and
ought
to
be
accomplished
in
all
liberty
it
the
state
merely
places
society
on
an
incline
that
is
all
that
it
may
descend
when
once
it
is
placed
there
by
the
mere
force
of
things
and
by
the
natural
course
of
the
established
mechanism
but
what
is
this
incline
one
indicated
by
louis
blanc
does
it
not
lead
to
an
abyss
no
it
leads
to
happiness
why
then
does
not
society
go
there
of
itself
because
it
does
not
know
what
it
wants
and
it
requires
an
impulse
what
is
to
give
it
this
impulse
power
and
who
is
to
give
the
impulse
to
power
the
inventor
of
the
machine
louis
blanc
we
shall
never
get
out
of
this
circle
mankind
passive
and
a
great
man
moving
it
by
the
intervention
of
the
law
once
on
this
incline
will
society
enjoy
something
like
liberty
without
a
doubt
and
what
is
liberty
once
for
all
liberty
consists
not
only
in
the
right
granted
but
in
the
power
given
to
man
to
exercise
to
develop
his
faculties
under
the
empire
of
justice
and
under
the
protection
of
the
law
and
this
is
no
vain
distinction
there
is
a
deep
meaning
in
it
and
its
consequences
are
imponderable
for
when
once
it
is
admitted
that
man
to
be
truly
free
must
have
the
power
to
exercise
and
develop
his
faculties
it
follows
that
every
member
of
society
has
a
claim
upon
it
for
such
education
as
shall
enable
his
faculties
to
display
themselves
and
for
the
tools
of
labor
without
which
human
activity
can
find
no
scope
now
by
whose
intervention
is
society
to
give
to
each
of
its
members
the
requisite
education
and
the
necessary
tools
of
labor
unless
by
that
of
the
state
thus
liberty
is
power
in
what
does
this
power
consist
in
possessing
education
and
tools
of
labor
who
is
to
give
education
and
tools
of
labor
society
who
owes
them
by
whose
intervention
is
society
to
give
tools
of
labor
to
those
who
do
not
possess
them
by
the
intervention
of
the
state
from
whom
is
the
state
to
obtain
them
it
is
for
the
reader
to
answer
this
question
and
to
notice
whither
all
this
tends
one
of
the
strangest
phenomena
of
our
time
and
one
that
will
probably
be
a
matter
of
astonishment
to
our
descendants
is
the
doctrine
which
is
founded
upon
this
triple
hypothesis
the
radical
passiveness
of
mankind
the
omnipotence
of
the
law
the
infallibility
of
the
legislator
this
is
the
sacred
symbol
of
the
party
that
proclaims
itself
exclusively
democratic
it
is
true
that
it
professes
also
to
be
social
so
far
as
it
is
democratic
it
has
an
unlimited
faith
in
mankind
so
far
as
it
is
social
it
places
mankind
beneath
the
mud
are
political
rights
under
discussion
is
a
legislator
to
be
chosen
oh
then
the
people
possess
science
by
instinct
they
are
gifted
with
an
admirable
discernment
their
will
is
always
right
the
general
will
can
not
err
suffrage
can
not
be
too
universal
nobody
is
under
any
responsibility
to
society
the
will
and
the
capacity
to
choose
well
are
taken
for
granted
can
the
people
be
mistaken
are
we
not
living
in
an
age
of
enlightenment
what
are
the
people
to
be
forever
led
about
by
the
nose
have
they
not
acquired
their
rights
at
the
cost
of
effort
and
sacrifice
have
they
not
given
sufficient
proof
of
intelligence
and
wisdom
are
they
not
arrived
at
maturity
are
they
not
in
a
state
to
judge
for
themselves
do
they
not
know
their
own
interest
is
there
a
man
or
a
class
who
would
dare
to
claim
the
right
of
putting
himself
in
the
place
of
the
people
of
deciding
and
of
acting
for
them
no
no
the
people
would
be
free
and
they
shall
be
so
they
wish
to
conduct
their
own
affairs
and
they
shall
do
so
but
when
once
the
legislator
is
duly
elected
then
indeed
the
style
of
his
speech
alters
the
nation
is
sent
back
into
passiveness
inertness
nothingness
and
the
legislator
takes
possession
of
omnipotence
it
is
for
him
to
invent
for
him
to
direct
for
him
to
impel
for
him
to
organize
mankind
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
submit
the
hour
of
despotism
has
struck
and
we
must
observe
that
this
is
decisive
for
the
people
just
before
so
enlightened
so
moral
so
perfect
have
no
inclinations
at
all
or
if
they
have
any
these
all
lead
them
downwards
towards
degradation
and
yet
they
ought
to
have
a
little
liberty
but
are
we
not
assured
by
considerant
that
liberty
leads
fatally
to
monopoly
are
we
not
told
that
liberty
is
competition
and
that
competition
according
to
louis
blanc
is
a
system
of
extermination
for
the
people
and
of
ruination
for
trade
for
that
reason
people
are
exterminated
and
ruined
in
proportion
as
they
are
free
take
for
example
switzerland
holland
england
and
the
united
states
does
not
louis
blanc
tell
us
again
that
competition
leads
to
monopoly
and
that
for
the
same
reason
cheapness
leads
to
exorbitant
prices
that
competition
tends
to
drain
the
sources
of
consumption
and
diverts
production
to
a
destructive
activity
that
competition
forces
production
to
increase
and
consumption
to
decrease
whence
it
follows
that
free
people
produce
for
the
sake
of
not
consuming
that
there
is
nothing
but
oppression
and
madness
among
them
and
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
louis
blanc
to
see
to
it
what
sort
of
liberty
should
be
allowed
to
men
liberty
of
conscience
but
we
should
see
them
all
profiting
by
the
permission
to
become
atheists
liberty
of
education
but
parents
would
be
paying
professors
to
teach
their
sons
immorality
and
error
besides
if
we
are
to
believe
thiers
education
if
left
to
the
national
liberty
would
cease
to
be
national
and
we
should
be
educating
our
children
in
the
ideas
of
the
turks
or
hindus
instead
of
which
thanks
to
the
legal
despotism
of
the
universities
they
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
educated
in
the
noble
ideas
of
the
romans
liberty
of
labor
but
this
is
only
competition
whose
effect
is
to
leave
all
products
unconsumed
to
exterminate
the
people
and
to
ruin
the
tradesmen
the
liberty
of
exchange
but
it
is
well
known
that
the
protectionists
have
shown
over
and
over
again
that
a
man
will
inevitably
be
ruined
when
he
exchanges
freely
and
that
to
become
rich
it
is
necessary
to
exchange
without
liberty
liberty
of
association
but
according
to
the
socialist
doctrine
liberty
and
association
exclude
each
other
for
the
liberty
of
men
is
attacked
just
to
force
them
to
associate
you
must
see
then
that
the
socialist
democrats
can
not
in
conscience
allow
men
any
liberty
because
by
their
own
nature
they
tend
in
every
instance
to
all
kinds
of
degradation
and
demoralization
we
are
therefore
left
to
conjecture
in
this
case
upon
what
foundation
universal
suffrage
is
claimed
for
them
with
so
much
importunity
the
pretensions
of
organizers
suggest
another
question
which
i
have
often
asked
them
and
to
which
i
am
not
aware
that
i
ever
received
an
answer
since
the
natural
tendencies
of
mankind
are
so
bad
that
it
is
not
safe
to
allow
them
liberty
how
comes
it
to
pass
that
the
tendencies
of
organizers
are
always
good
do
not
the
legislators
and
their
agents
form
a
part
of
the
human
race
do
they
consider
that
they
are
composed
of
different
materials
from
the
rest
of
mankind
they
say
that
society
when
left
to
itself
rushes
to
inevitable
destruction
because
its
instincts
are
perverse
they
presume
to
stop
it
in
its
downward
course
and
to
give
it
a
better
direction
they
have
therefore
received
from
heaven
intelligence
and
virtues
that
place
them
beyond
and
above
mankind
let
them
show
their
title
to
this
superiority
they
would
be
our
shepherds
and
we
are
to
be
their
flock
this
arrangement
presupposes
in
them
a
natural
superiority
the
right
to
which
we
are
fully
justified
in
calling
upon
them
to
prove
you
must
observe
that
i
am
not
contending
against
their
right
to
invent
social
combinations
to
propagate
them
to
recommend
them
and
to
try
them
upon
themselves
at
their
own
expense
and
risk
but
i
do
dispute
their
right
to
impose
them
upon
us
through
the
medium
of
the
law
that
is
by
force
and
by
public
taxes
i
would
not
insist
upon
the
cabetists
the
fourierists
the
proudhonians
the
academics
and
the
protectionists
renouncing
their
own
particular
ideas
i
would
only
have
them
renounce
the
idea
that
is
common
to
them
all
that
of
subjecting
us
by
force
to
their
own
categories
and
rankings
to
their
social
laboratories
to
their
bank
to
their
morality
and
to
their
commercial
restrictions
i
would
ask
them
to
allow
us
the
faculty
of
judging
of
their
plans
and
not
to
oblige
us
to
adopt
them
if
we
find
that
they
hurt
our
interests
or
are
repugnant
to
our
consciences
to
presume
to
have
recourse
to
power
and
taxation
besides
being
oppressive
and
unjust
implies
further
the
pernicious
assumption
that
the
organized
is
infallible
and
mankind
incompetent
and
if
mankind
is
not
competent
to
judge
for
itself
why
do
they
talk
so
much
about
universal
suffrage
this
contradiction
in
ideas
is
unhappily
to
be
found
also
in
facts
and
whilst
the
french
nation
has
preceded
all
others
in
obtaining
its
rights
or
rather
its
political
claims
this
has
by
no
means
prevented
it
from
being
more
governed
and
directed
and
imposed
upon
and
fettered
and
cheated
than
any
other
nation
it
is
also
the
one
of
all
others
where
revolutions
are
constantly
to
be
dreaded
and
it
is
perfectly
natural
that
it
should
be
so
so
long
as
this
idea
is
retained
which
is
admitted
by
all
our
politicians
and
so
energetically
expressed
by
louis
blanc
in
these
words
society
receives
its
impulse
from
power
so
long
as
men
consider
themselves
as
capable
of
feeling
yet
passive
incapable
of
raising
themselves
by
their
own
discernment
and
by
their
own
energy
to
any
morality
or
and
while
they
expect
everything
from
the
law
in
a
word
while
they
admit
that
their
relations
with
the
state
are
the
same
as
those
of
the
flock
with
the
shepherd
it
is
clear
that
the
responsibility
of
power
is
immense
fortune
and
misfortune
wealth
and
destitution
equality
and
inequality
all
proceed
from
it
it
is
charged
with
everything
it
undertakes
everything
it
does
everything
therefore
it
has
to
answer
for
everything
if
we
are
happy
it
has
a
right
to
claim
our
gratitude
but
if
we
are
miserable
it
alone
must
bear
the
blame
are
not
our
persons
and
property
in
fact
at
its
disposal
is
not
the
law
omnipotent
in
creating
the
educational
monopoly
it
has
undertaken
to
answer
the
expectations
of
fathers
of
families
who
have
been
deprived
of
liberty
and
if
these
expectations
are
disappointed
whose
fault
is
it
in
regulating
industry
it
has
undertaken
to
make
it
prosper
otherwise
it
would
have
been
absurd
to
deprive
it
of
its
liberty
and
if
it
suffers
whose
fault
is
it
in
pretending
to
adjust
the
balance
of
commerce
by
the
game
of
tariffs
it
undertakes
to
make
commerce
prosper
and
if
so
far
from
prospering
it
is
destroyed
whose
fault
is
it
in
granting
its
protection
to
maritime
armaments
in
exchange
for
their
liberty
it
has
undertaken
to
render
them
if
they
become
burdensome
whose
fault
is
it
thus
there
is
not
a
grievance
in
the
nation
for
which
the
government
does
not
voluntarily
make
itself
responsible
is
it
any
wonder
that
every
failure
threatens
to
cause
a
revolution
and
what
is
the
remedy
proposed
to
extend
indefinitely
the
dominion
of
the
law
the
responsibility
of
government
but
if
the
government
undertakes
to
raise
and
to
regulate
wages
and
is
not
able
to
do
it
if
it
undertakes
to
assist
all
those
who
are
in
want
and
is
not
able
to
do
it
if
it
undertakes
to
provide
work
for
every
laborer
and
is
not
able
to
do
it
if
it
undertakes
to
offer
to
all
who
wish
to
borrow
easy
credit
and
is
not
able
to
do
it
if
in
words
that
we
regret
should
have
escaped
the
pen
of
de
lamartine
the
state
considers
that
its
mission
is
to
enlighten
to
develop
to
enlarge
to
strengthen
to
spiritualize
and
to
sanctify
the
soul
of
the
people
if
it
fails
in
this
is
it
not
obvious
that
after
every
disappointment
which
alas
is
more
than
probable
there
will
be
a
no
less
inevitable
revolution
i
shall
now
resume
the
subject
by
remarking
that
immediately
after
the
economical
part
of
the
question
and
before
the
political
part
a
leading
question
presents
itself
it
is
the
following
what
is
law
what
ought
it
to
be
what
is
its
domain
what
are
its
limits
where
in
fact
does
the
prerogative
of
the
legislator
stop
i
have
no
hesitation
in
answering
law
is
common
force
organized
to
prevent
injustice
in
short
law
is
justice
it
is
not
true
that
the
legislator
has
absolute
power
over
our
persons
and
property
since
they
and
his
work
is
only
to
secure
them
from
injury
it
is
not
true
that
the
mission
of
the
law
is
to
regulate
our
consciences
our
ideas
our
will
our
education
our
sentiments
our
works
our
exchanges
our
gifts
our
enjoyments
its
mission
is
to
prevent
the
rights
of
one
from
interfering
with
those
of
another
in
any
one
of
these
things
law
because
it
has
force
for
its
necessary
sanction
can
only
have
the
domain
of
force
which
is
justice
and
as
every
individual
has
a
right
to
have
recourse
to
force
only
in
cases
of
lawful
defense
so
collective
force
so
which
is
only
the
union
of
individual
forces
can
not
be
rationally
used
for
any
other
end
the
law
then
is
solely
the
organization
of
individual
rights
that
existed
before
law
law
is
justice
so
far
from
being
able
to
oppress
the
people
or
to
plunder
their
property
even
for
a
philanthropic
end
its
mission
is
to
protect
the
people
and
to
secure
to
them
the
possession
of
their
property
it
must
not
be
said
either
that
it
may
be
philanthropic
so
long
as
it
abstains
from
all
oppression
for
this
is
a
contradiction
the
law
can
not
avoid
acting
upon
our
persons
and
property
if
it
does
not
secure
them
then
it
violates
them
if
it
touches
them
the
law
is
justice
nothing
can
be
more
clear
and
simple
more
perfectly
defined
and
bounded
or
more
visible
to
every
eye
for
justice
is
a
given
quantity
immutable
and
unchangeable
and
which
admits
of
neither
increase
or
diminution
depart
from
this
point
make
the
law
religious
fraternal
equalizing
industrial
literary
or
artistic
and
you
will
be
lost
in
vagueness
and
uncertainty
you
will
be
upon
unknown
ground
in
a
forced
utopia
or
what
is
worse
in
the
midst
of
a
multitude
of
contending
utopias
each
striving
to
gain
possession
of
the
law
and
to
impose
it
upon
you
for
fraternity
and
philanthropy
have
no
fixed
limits
as
justice
has
where
will
you
stop
where
is
the
law
to
stop
one
person
de
saint
cricq
will
only
extend
his
philanthropy
to
some
of
the
industrial
classes
and
will
require
the
law
to
slight
the
consumers
in
favor
of
the
producers
another
like
considérant
will
take
up
the
cause
of
the
working
classes
and
claim
for
them
by
means
of
the
law
at
a
fixed
rate
clothing
lodging
food
and
everything
necessary
for
the
support
of
life
a
third
louis
blanc
will
say
and
with
reason
that
this
would
be
an
incomplete
fraternity
and
that
the
law
ought
to
provide
them
with
tools
of
labor
and
education
a
fourth
will
observe
that
such
an
arrangement
still
leaves
room
for
inequality
and
that
the
law
ought
to
introduce
into
the
most
remote
hamlets
luxury
literature
and
the
arts
this
is
the
high
road
to
communism
in
other
words
legislation
will
be
as
it
now
is
the
battlefield
for
everybody
dreams
and
everybody
covetousness
law
is
justice
in
this
proposition
we
represent
to
ourselves
a
simple
immovable
government
and
i
defy
anyone
to
tell
me
whence
the
thought
of
a
revolution
an
insurrection
or
a
simple
disturbance
could
arise
against
a
public
force
confined
to
the
repression
of
injustice
under
such
a
system
there
would
be
more
and
this
would
be
more
equally
distributed
and
as
to
the
sufferings
inseparable
from
humanity
no
one
would
think
of
accusing
the
government
of
them
for
it
would
be
as
innocent
of
them
as
it
is
of
the
variations
of
the
temperature
have
the
people
ever
been
known
to
rise
against
the
court
of
appeals
or
assail
the
justices
of
the
peace
for
the
sake
of
claiming
the
rate
of
wages
free
credit
tools
of
labor
the
advantages
of
the
tariff
or
the
social
workshop
they
know
perfectly
well
that
these
matters
are
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
justices
of
the
peace
and
they
would
soon
learn
that
they
are
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
law
quite
as
much
but
if
the
law
were
to
be
made
upon
the
principle
of
fraternity
if
it
were
to
be
proclaimed
that
from
it
proceed
all
benefits
and
all
evils
that
it
is
responsible
for
every
individual
grievance
and
for
every
social
inequality
then
you
open
the
door
to
an
endless
succession
of
complaints
irritations
troubles
and
revolutions
is
and
it
would
be
very
strange
if
it
could
properly
be
anything
else
is
not
justice
right
are
not
rights
equal
with
what
show
of
right
can
the
law
interfere
to
subject
me
to
the
social
plans
of
mimerel
de
melun
thiers
or
louis
blanc
rather
than
to
subject
these
gentlemen
to
my
plans
is
it
to
be
supposed
that
nature
has
not
bestowed
upon
me
sufficient
imagination
to
invent
a
utopia
too
is
it
for
the
law
to
make
choice
of
one
amongst
so
many
fancies
and
to
make
use
of
the
public
force
in
its
service
is
and
let
it
not
be
said
as
it
continually
is
that
the
law
in
this
sense
would
be
atheistic
individual
and
heartless
and
that
it
would
mold
mankind
in
its
own
image
this
is
an
absurd
conclusion
quite
worthy
of
the
governmental
infatuation
which
sees
mankind
in
the
law
what
then
does
it
follow
that
if
we
are
free
we
shall
cease
to
act
does
it
follow
that
if
we
do
not
receive
an
impulse
from
the
law
we
shall
receive
no
impulse
at
all
does
it
follow
that
if
the
law
confines
itself
to
securing
to
us
the
free
exercise
of
our
faculties
our
faculties
will
be
paralyzed
does
it
follow
that
if
the
law
does
not
impose
upon
us
forms
of
religion
modes
of
association
methods
of
education
rules
for
labor
directions
for
exchange
and
plans
for
charity
we
shall
plunge
headlong
into
atheism
isolation
ignorance
misery
and
greed
does
it
follow
that
we
shall
no
longer
recognize
the
power
and
goodness
of
god
that
we
shall
cease
to
associate
together
to
help
each
other
to
love
and
assist
our
unfortunate
brethren
to
study
the
secrets
of
nature
and
to
aspire
after
perfection
in
our
existence
is
and
it
is
under
the
law
of
justice
under
the
reign
of
right
under
the
influence
of
liberty
security
stability
and
responsibility
that
every
man
will
attain
to
the
fullness
of
his
worth
to
all
the
dignity
of
his
being
and
that
mankind
will
accomplish
with
order
and
with
calmness
slowly
it
is
true
but
with
certainty
the
progress
ordained
for
it
i
believe
that
my
theory
is
correct
for
whatever
be
the
question
upon
which
i
am
arguing
whether
it
be
religious
philosophical
political
or
economical
whether
it
affects
morality
equality
right
justice
progress
responsibility
property
labor
exchange
capital
wages
taxes
population
credit
or
government
at
whatever
point
of
the
scientific
horizon
i
start
from
i
invariably
come
to
the
same
thing
the
solution
of
the
social
problem
is
in
liberty
and
have
i
not
experience
on
my
side
cast
your
eye
over
the
globe
which
are
the
happiest
the
most
moral
and
the
most
peaceable
nations
those
where
the
law
interferes
the
least
with
private
activity
where
the
government
is
the
least
felt
where
individuality
has
the
most
scope
and
public
opinion
the
most
influence
where
the
machinery
of
the
administration
is
the
least
important
and
the
least
complicated
where
taxation
is
lightest
and
least
unequal
popular
discontent
the
least
excited
and
the
least
justifiable
where
the
responsibility
of
individuals
and
classes
is
the
most
active
and
where
consequently
if
morals
are
not
in
a
perfect
state
at
any
rate
they
tend
incessantly
to
correct
themselves
where
transactions
meetings
and
associations
are
the
least
fettered
where
labor
capital
and
production
suffer
the
least
from
artificial
displacements
where
mankind
follows
most
completely
its
own
natural
course
where
the
thought
of
god
prevails
the
most
over
the
inventions
of
men
those
in
short
who
realize
the
most
nearly
this
idea
that
within
the
limits
of
right
all
should
flow
from
the
free
perfectible
and
voluntary
action
of
man
nothing
be
attempted
by
the
law
or
by
force
except
the
administration
of
universal
justice
i
can
not
avoid
coming
to
this
conclusion
that
there
are
too
many
great
men
in
the
world
there
are
too
many
legislators
organizers
institutors
of
society
conductors
of
the
people
fathers
of
nations
etc
too
many
persons
place
themselves
above
mankind
to
rule
and
patronize
it
too
many
persons
make
a
trade
of
looking
after
it
it
will
be
answered
you
yourself
are
occupied
upon
it
all
this
time
very
true
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
is
in
another
sense
entirely
that
i
am
speaking
and
if
i
join
the
reformers
it
is
solely
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
them
to
relax
their
hold
i
am
not
doing
as
vaucauson
did
with
his
automaton
but
as
a
physiologist
does
with
the
human
frame
i
would
study
and
admire
it
i
am
acting
with
regard
to
it
in
the
spirit
that
animated
a
celebrated
traveler
he
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
a
savage
tribe
a
child
had
just
been
born
and
a
crowd
of
soothsayers
magicians
and
quacks
were
around
it
armed
with
rings
hooks
and
bandages
one
said
this
child
will
never
smell
the
perfume
of
a
calumet
unless
i
stretch
his
nostrils
another
said
he
will
be
without
the
sense
of
hearing
unless
i
draw
his
ears
down
to
his
shoulders
a
third
said
he
will
never
see
the
light
of
the
sun
unless
i
give
his
eyes
an
oblique
direction
a
fourth
said
he
will
never
be
upright
unless
i
bend
his
legs
a
fifth
said
he
will
not
be
able
to
think
unless
i
press
his
brain
stop
said
the
traveler
whatever
god
does
is
well
done
do
not
pretend
to
know
more
than
he
and
as
he
has
given
organs
to
this
frail
creature
allow
those
organs
to
develop
themselves
to
strengthen
themselves
by
exercise
use
experience
and
liberty
god
has
implanted
in
mankind
also
all
that
is
necessary
to
enable
it
to
accomplish
its
destinies
there
is
a
providential
social
physiology
as
well
as
a
providential
human
physiology
the
social
organs
are
constituted
so
as
to
enable
them
to
develop
harmoniously
in
the
grand
air
of
liberty
away
then
with
quacks
and
organizers
away
with
their
rings
and
their
chains
and
their
hooks
and
their
pincers
away
with
their
artificial
methods
away
with
their
social
laboratories
their
governmental
whims
their
centralization
their
tariffs
their
universities
their
state
religions
their
inflationary
or
monopolizing
banks
their
limitations
their
restrictions
their
moralizations
and
their
equalization
by
taxation
and
now
after
having
vainly
inflicted
upon
the
social
body
so
many
systems
let
them
end
where
they
ought
to
have
begun
reject
all
systems
and
try
liberty
liberty
which
is
an
act
of
faith
in
god
and
in
his
work
