chapter
i
a
bedroom
of
the
sixteenth
century
on
a
winter
s
night
about
two
in
the
morning
the
comtesse
jeanne
d
herouville
felt
such
violent
pains
that
in
spite
of
her
inexperience
she
was
conscious
of
an
approaching
confinement
and
the
instinct
which
makes
us
hope
for
ease
in
a
change
of
posture
induced
her
to
sit
up
in
her
bed
either
to
study
the
nature
of
these
new
sufferings
or
to
reflect
on
her
situation
she
was
a
prey
to
cruel
fears
caused
less
by
the
dread
of
a
first
which
terrifies
most
women
than
by
certain
dangers
which
awaited
her
child
in
order
not
to
awaken
her
husband
who
was
sleeping
beside
her
the
poor
woman
moved
with
precautions
which
her
intense
terror
made
as
minute
as
those
of
a
prisoner
endeavoring
to
escape
though
the
pains
became
more
and
more
severe
she
ceased
to
feel
them
so
completely
did
she
concentrate
her
own
strength
on
the
painful
effort
of
resting
her
two
moist
hands
on
the
pillow
and
so
turning
her
suffering
body
from
a
posture
in
which
she
could
find
no
ease
at
the
slightest
rustling
of
the
huge
green
silk
coverlet
under
which
she
had
slept
but
little
since
her
marriage
she
stopped
as
though
she
had
rung
a
bell
forced
to
watch
the
count
she
divided
her
attention
between
the
folds
of
the
rustling
stuff
and
a
large
swarthy
face
the
moustache
of
which
was
brushing
her
shoulder
when
some
noisier
breath
than
usual
left
her
husband
s
lips
she
was
filled
with
a
sudden
terror
that
revived
the
color
driven
from
her
cheeks
by
her
double
anguish
the
prisoner
reached
the
prison
door
in
the
dead
of
night
and
trying
to
noiselessly
turn
the
key
in
a
pitiless
lock
was
never
more
timidly
bold
when
the
countess
had
succeeded
in
rising
to
her
seat
without
awakening
her
keeper
she
made
a
gesture
of
childlike
joy
which
revealed
the
touching
naivete
of
her
nature
but
the
smile
on
her
burning
lips
was
quickly
suppressed
a
thought
came
to
darken
that
pure
brow
and
her
long
blue
eyes
resumed
their
sad
expression
she
gave
a
sigh
and
again
laid
her
hands
not
without
precaution
on
the
fatal
conjugal
pillow
then
as
if
for
the
first
time
since
her
marriage
she
found
herself
free
in
thought
and
action
she
looked
at
the
things
around
her
stretching
out
her
neck
with
little
darting
motions
like
those
of
a
bird
in
its
cage
seeing
her
thus
it
was
easy
to
divine
that
she
had
once
been
all
gaiety
and
but
that
fate
had
suddenly
mown
down
her
hopes
and
changed
her
ingenuous
gaiety
to
sadness
the
chamber
was
one
of
those
which
to
this
day
octogenarian
porters
of
old
chateaus
point
out
to
visitors
as
the
state
bedroom
where
louis
xiii
once
fine
pictures
mostly
brown
in
tone
were
framed
in
walnut
the
delicate
carvings
of
which
were
blackened
by
time
the
rafters
of
the
ceiling
formed
compartments
adorned
with
arabesques
in
the
style
of
the
preceding
century
which
preserved
the
colors
of
the
chestnut
wood
these
decorations
severe
in
tone
reflected
the
light
so
little
that
it
was
difficult
to
see
their
designs
even
when
the
sun
shone
full
into
that
long
and
wide
and
lofty
chamber
the
silver
lamp
placed
upon
the
mantel
of
the
vast
fireplace
lighted
the
room
so
feebly
that
its
quivering
gleam
could
be
compared
only
to
the
nebulous
stars
which
appear
at
moments
through
the
dun
gray
clouds
of
an
autumn
night
the
fantastic
figures
crowded
on
the
marble
of
the
fireplace
which
was
opposite
to
the
bed
were
so
grotesquely
hideous
that
she
dared
not
fix
her
eyes
upon
them
fearing
to
see
them
move
or
to
hear
a
startling
laugh
from
their
gaping
and
twisted
mouths
at
this
moment
a
tempest
was
growling
in
the
chimney
giving
to
every
puff
of
wind
a
lugubrious
meaning
the
vast
size
of
the
flute
putting
the
hearth
into
such
close
communication
with
the
skies
above
that
the
embers
upon
it
had
a
sort
of
respiration
they
sparkled
and
went
out
at
the
will
of
the
wind
the
arms
of
the
family
of
herouville
carved
in
white
marble
with
their
mantle
and
supporters
gave
the
appearance
of
a
tomb
to
this
species
of
edifice
which
formed
a
pendant
to
the
bed
another
erection
raised
to
the
glory
of
hymen
modern
architects
would
have
been
puzzled
to
decide
whether
the
room
had
been
built
for
the
bed
or
the
bed
for
the
room
two
cupids
playing
on
the
walnut
headboard
wreathed
with
garlands
might
have
passed
for
angels
and
columns
of
the
same
wood
supporting
the
tester
were
carved
with
mythological
allegories
the
explanation
of
which
could
have
been
found
either
in
the
bible
or
ovid
s
metamorphoses
take
away
the
bed
and
the
same
tester
would
have
served
in
a
church
for
the
canopy
of
the
pulpit
or
the
seats
of
the
wardens
the
married
pair
mounted
by
three
steps
to
this
sumptuous
couch
which
stood
upon
a
platform
and
was
hung
with
curtains
of
green
silk
covered
with
brilliant
designs
called
ramages
possibly
because
the
birds
of
gay
plumage
there
depicted
were
supposed
to
sing
the
folds
of
these
immense
curtains
were
so
stiff
that
in
the
they
might
have
been
taken
for
some
metal
fabric
on
the
green
velvet
hanging
adorned
with
gold
fringes
which
covered
the
foot
of
this
lordly
couch
the
superstition
of
the
comtes
d
herouville
had
affixed
a
large
crucifix
on
which
their
chaplain
placed
a
fresh
branch
of
sacred
box
when
he
renewed
at
easter
the
holy
water
in
the
basin
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
stood
a
large
box
or
wardrobe
of
choice
woods
magnificently
carved
such
as
brides
receive
even
now
in
the
provinces
on
their
wedding
day
these
old
chests
now
so
much
in
request
by
antiquaries
were
the
arsenals
from
which
women
drew
the
rich
and
elegant
treasures
of
their
personal
adornment
laces
bodices
high
collars
and
ruffs
gowns
of
price
masks
gloves
veils
in
fact
all
the
inventions
of
coquetry
in
the
sixteenth
century
on
the
other
side
by
way
of
symmetry
was
another
piece
of
furniture
somewhat
similar
in
shape
where
the
countess
kept
her
books
papers
and
jewels
antique
chairs
covered
with
damask
a
large
and
greenish
mirror
made
in
venice
and
richly
framed
in
a
sort
of
rolling
completed
the
furnishings
of
the
room
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
persian
carpet
the
richness
of
which
proved
the
gallantry
of
the
count
on
the
upper
step
of
the
bed
stood
a
little
table
on
which
the
served
every
night
in
a
gold
or
silver
cup
a
drink
prepared
with
spices
after
we
have
gone
some
way
in
life
we
know
the
secret
influence
exerted
by
places
on
the
condition
of
the
soul
who
has
not
had
his
darksome
moments
when
fresh
hope
has
come
into
his
heart
from
things
that
surrounded
him
the
fortunate
or
the
unfortunate
man
attributes
an
intelligent
countenance
to
the
things
among
which
he
lives
he
listens
to
them
he
consults
them
so
naturally
superstitious
is
he
at
this
moment
the
countess
turned
her
eyes
upon
all
these
articles
of
furniture
as
if
they
were
living
beings
whose
help
and
protection
she
implored
but
the
answer
of
that
sombre
luxury
seemed
to
her
inexorable
suddenly
the
tempest
redoubled
the
poor
young
woman
could
augur
nothing
favorable
as
she
listened
to
the
threatening
heavens
the
changes
of
which
were
interpreted
in
those
credulous
days
according
to
the
ideas
or
the
habits
of
individuals
suddenly
she
turned
her
eyes
to
the
two
arched
windows
at
the
end
of
the
room
but
the
smallness
of
their
panes
and
the
multiplicity
of
the
leaden
lines
did
not
allow
her
to
see
the
sky
and
judge
if
the
world
were
coming
to
an
end
as
certain
monks
eager
for
donations
affirmed
she
might
easily
have
believed
in
such
predictions
for
the
noise
of
the
angry
sea
the
waves
of
which
beat
against
the
castle
wall
combined
with
the
mighty
voice
of
the
tempest
so
that
even
the
rocks
appeared
to
shake
though
her
sufferings
were
now
becoming
keener
and
less
endurable
the
countess
dared
not
awaken
her
husband
but
she
turned
and
examined
his
features
as
if
despair
were
urging
her
to
find
a
consolation
there
against
so
many
sinister
forebodings
if
matters
were
sad
around
the
poor
young
woman
that
face
notwithstanding
the
tranquillity
of
sleep
seemed
sadder
still
the
light
from
the
lamp
flickering
in
the
draught
scarcely
reached
beyond
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
illumined
the
count
s
head
capriciously
so
that
the
fitful
movements
of
its
flash
upon
those
features
in
repose
produced
the
effect
of
a
struggle
with
angry
thought
the
countess
was
scarcely
reassured
by
perceiving
the
cause
of
that
phenomenon
each
time
that
a
gust
of
wind
projected
the
light
upon
the
count
s
large
face
casting
shadows
among
its
bony
outlines
she
fancied
that
her
husband
was
about
to
fix
upon
her
his
two
insupportably
stern
eyes
implacable
as
the
war
then
going
on
between
the
church
and
calvinism
the
count
s
forehead
was
threatening
even
while
he
slept
many
furrows
produced
by
the
emotions
of
a
warrior
life
gave
it
a
vague
resemblance
to
the
vermiculated
stone
which
we
see
in
the
buildings
of
that
period
his
hair
like
the
whitish
lichen
of
old
oaks
gray
before
its
time
surrounded
without
grace
a
cruel
brow
where
religious
intolerance
showed
its
passionate
brutality
the
shape
of
the
aquiline
nose
which
resembled
the
beak
of
a
bird
of
prey
the
black
and
crinkled
lids
of
the
yellow
eyes
the
prominent
bones
of
a
hollow
face
the
rigidity
of
the
wrinkles
the
disdain
expressed
in
the
lower
lip
were
all
expressive
of
ambition
despotism
and
power
the
more
to
be
feared
because
the
narrowness
of
the
skull
betrayed
an
almost
total
absence
of
intelligence
and
a
mere
brute
courage
devoid
of
generosity
the
face
was
horribly
disfigured
by
a
large
transversal
scar
which
had
the
appearance
of
a
second
mouth
on
the
right
cheek
at
the
age
of
the
count
anxious
to
distinguish
himself
in
that
unhappy
religious
war
the
signal
for
which
was
given
on
s
day
had
been
grievously
wounded
at
the
siege
of
rochelle
the
misfortune
of
this
wound
increased
his
hatred
against
the
partisans
of
what
the
language
of
that
day
called
the
religion
but
by
a
not
unnatural
turn
of
mind
he
included
in
that
antipathy
all
handsome
men
before
the
catastrophe
however
he
was
so
repulsively
ugly
that
no
lady
had
ever
been
willing
to
receive
him
as
a
suitor
the
only
passion
of
his
youth
was
for
a
celebrated
woman
called
la
belle
romaine
the
distrust
resulting
from
this
new
misfortune
made
him
suspicious
to
the
point
of
not
believing
himself
capable
of
inspiring
a
true
passion
and
his
character
became
so
savage
that
when
he
did
have
some
successes
in
gallantry
he
owed
them
to
the
terror
inspired
by
his
cruelty
the
left
hand
of
this
terrible
catholic
which
lay
on
the
outside
of
the
bed
will
complete
this
sketch
of
his
character
stretched
out
as
if
to
guard
the
countess
as
a
miser
guards
his
hoard
that
enormous
hand
was
covered
with
hair
so
thick
it
presented
such
a
network
of
veins
and
projecting
muscles
that
it
gave
the
idea
of
a
branch
of
birch
clasped
with
a
growth
of
yellowing
ivy
children
looking
at
the
count
s
face
would
have
thought
him
an
ogre
terrible
tales
of
whom
they
knew
by
heart
it
was
enough
to
see
the
width
and
length
of
the
space
occupied
by
the
count
in
the
bed
to
imagine
his
gigantic
proportions
when
awake
his
gray
eyebrows
hid
his
eyelids
in
a
way
to
heighten
the
light
of
his
eye
which
glittered
with
the
luminous
ferocity
of
a
wolf
skulking
on
the
watch
in
a
forest
under
his
lion
nose
with
its
flaring
nostrils
a
large
and
moustache
for
he
despised
all
toilet
niceties
completely
concealed
the
upper
lip
happily
for
the
countess
her
husband
s
wide
mouth
was
silent
at
this
moment
for
the
softest
sounds
of
that
harsh
voice
made
her
tremble
though
the
comte
d
herouville
was
barely
fifty
years
of
age
he
appeared
at
first
sight
to
be
sixty
so
much
had
the
toils
of
war
without
injuring
his
robust
constitution
dilapidated
him
physically
the
countess
who
was
now
in
her
nineteenth
year
made
a
painful
contrast
to
that
large
repulsive
figure
she
was
fair
and
slim
her
chestnut
locks
threaded
with
gold
played
upon
her
neck
like
russet
shadows
and
defined
a
face
such
as
carlo
dolce
has
painted
for
his
madonnas
a
face
which
now
seemed
ready
to
expire
under
the
increasing
attacks
of
physical
pain
you
might
have
thought
her
the
apparition
of
an
angel
sent
from
heaven
to
soften
the
iron
will
of
the
terrible
count
no
he
will
not
kill
us
she
cried
to
herself
mentally
after
contemplating
her
husband
for
a
long
time
he
is
frank
courageous
faithful
to
his
word
faithful
to
his
word
repeating
that
last
sentence
in
her
thoughts
she
trembled
violently
and
remained
as
if
stupefied
to
understand
the
horror
of
her
present
situation
we
must
add
that
this
nocturnal
scene
took
place
in
a
period
when
civil
war
raged
throughout
france
and
the
laws
had
no
vigor
the
excesses
of
the
league
opposed
to
the
accession
of
henri
surpassed
the
calamities
of
the
religious
wars
license
was
so
universal
that
no
one
was
surprised
to
see
a
great
lord
kill
his
enemy
in
open
day
when
a
military
expedition
having
a
private
object
was
led
in
the
name
of
the
king
or
of
the
league
one
or
other
of
these
parties
applauded
it
it
was
thus
that
blagny
a
soldier
came
near
becoming
a
sovereign
prince
at
the
gates
of
france
sometime
before
henri
s
death
a
court
lady
murdered
a
nobleman
who
made
offensive
remarks
about
her
one
of
the
king
s
minions
remarked
to
him
hey
vive
dieu
sire
she
daggered
him
finely
the
comte
d
herouville
one
of
the
most
rabid
royalists
in
normandy
kept
the
part
of
that
province
which
adjoins
brittany
under
subjection
to
henri
iv
by
the
rigor
of
his
executions
the
head
of
one
of
the
richest
families
in
france
he
had
considerably
increased
the
revenues
of
his
great
estates
by
marrying
seven
months
before
the
night
on
which
this
history
begins
jeanne
de
a
young
lady
who
by
a
not
uncommon
chance
in
days
when
people
were
killed
off
like
flies
had
suddenly
become
the
representative
of
both
branches
of
the
family
necessity
and
terror
were
the
causes
which
led
to
this
union
at
a
banquet
given
two
months
after
the
marriage
to
the
comte
and
comtesse
d
herouville
a
discussion
arose
on
a
topic
which
in
those
days
of
ignorance
was
thought
amusing
namely
the
legitimacy
of
children
coming
into
the
world
ten
months
after
the
death
of
their
fathers
or
seven
months
after
the
wedding
day
madame
said
the
count
brutally
turning
to
his
wife
if
you
give
me
a
child
ten
months
after
my
death
i
can
not
help
it
but
be
careful
that
you
are
not
brought
to
bed
in
seven
months
what
would
you
do
then
old
bear
asked
the
young
marquis
de
verneuil
thinking
that
the
count
was
joking
i
should
wring
the
necks
of
mother
and
child
an
answer
so
peremptory
closed
the
discussion
imprudently
started
by
a
seigneur
from
lower
normandy
the
guests
were
silent
looking
with
a
sort
of
terror
at
the
pretty
comtesse
d
herouville
all
were
convinced
that
if
such
an
event
occurred
her
savage
lord
would
execute
his
threat
the
words
of
the
count
echoed
in
the
bosom
of
the
young
wife
then
pregnant
one
of
those
presentiments
which
furrow
a
track
like
lightning
through
the
soul
told
her
that
her
child
would
be
born
at
seven
months
an
inward
heat
overflowed
her
from
head
to
foot
sending
the
life
s
blood
to
her
heart
with
such
violence
that
the
surface
of
her
body
felt
bathed
in
ice
from
that
hour
not
a
day
had
passed
that
the
sense
of
secret
terror
did
not
check
every
impulse
of
her
innocent
gaiety
the
memory
of
the
look
of
the
inflections
of
voice
with
which
the
count
accompanied
his
words
still
froze
her
blood
and
silenced
her
sufferings
as
she
leaned
over
that
sleeping
head
and
strove
to
see
some
sign
of
a
pity
she
had
vainly
sought
there
when
awake
the
child
threatened
with
death
before
its
life
began
made
so
vigorous
a
movement
that
she
cried
aloud
in
a
voice
that
seemed
like
a
sigh
poor
babe
she
said
no
more
there
are
ideas
that
a
mother
can
not
bear
incapable
of
reasoning
at
this
moment
the
countess
was
almost
choked
with
the
intensity
of
a
suffering
as
yet
unknown
to
her
two
tears
escaping
from
her
eyes
rolled
slowly
down
her
cheeks
and
traced
two
shining
lines
remaining
suspended
at
the
bottom
of
that
white
face
like
dewdrops
on
a
lily
what
learned
man
would
take
upon
himself
to
say
that
the
child
unborn
is
on
some
neutral
ground
where
the
emotions
of
its
mother
do
not
penetrate
during
those
hours
when
soul
clasps
body
and
communicates
its
impressions
when
thought
permeates
blood
with
healing
balm
or
poisonous
fluids
the
terror
that
shakes
the
tree
will
it
not
hurt
the
fruit
those
words
poor
babe
were
they
dictated
by
a
vision
of
the
future
the
shuddering
of
this
mother
was
violent
her
look
piercing
the
bloody
answer
given
by
the
count
at
the
banquet
was
a
link
mysteriously
connecting
the
past
with
this
premature
confinement
that
odious
suspicion
thus
publicly
expressed
had
cast
into
the
memories
of
the
countess
a
dread
which
echoed
to
the
future
since
that
fatal
gala
she
had
driven
from
her
mind
with
as
much
fear
as
another
woman
would
have
found
pleasure
in
evoking
them
a
thousand
scattered
scenes
of
her
past
existence
she
refused
even
to
think
of
the
happy
days
when
her
heart
was
free
to
love
like
as
the
melodies
of
their
native
land
make
exiles
weep
so
these
memories
revived
sensations
so
delightful
that
her
young
conscience
thought
them
crimes
and
sued
them
to
enforce
still
further
the
savage
threat
of
the
count
there
lay
the
secret
of
the
horror
which
was
now
oppressing
her
soul
sleeping
figures
possess
a
sort
of
suavity
due
to
the
absolute
repose
of
both
body
and
mind
but
though
that
species
of
calmness
softened
but
slightly
the
harsh
expression
of
the
count
s
features
all
illusion
granted
to
the
unhappy
is
so
persuasive
that
the
poor
wife
ended
by
finding
hope
in
that
tranquillity
the
roar
of
the
tempest
now
descending
in
torrents
of
rain
seemed
to
her
no
more
than
a
melancholy
moan
her
fears
and
her
pains
both
yielded
her
a
momentary
respite
contemplating
the
man
to
whom
her
life
was
bound
the
countess
allowed
herself
to
float
into
a
reverie
the
sweetness
of
which
was
so
intoxicating
that
she
had
no
strength
to
break
its
charm
for
a
moment
by
one
of
those
visions
which
in
some
way
share
the
divine
power
there
passed
before
her
rapid
images
of
a
happiness
lost
beyond
recall
jeanne
in
her
vision
saw
faintly
and
as
if
in
a
distant
gleam
of
dawn
the
modest
castle
where
her
careless
childhood
had
glided
on
there
were
the
verdant
lawns
the
rippling
brook
the
little
chamber
the
scenes
of
her
happy
play
she
saw
herself
gathering
flowers
and
planting
them
unknowing
why
they
wilted
and
would
not
grow
despite
her
constancy
in
watering
them
next
she
saw
confusedly
the
vast
town
and
the
vast
house
blackened
by
age
to
which
her
mother
took
her
when
she
was
seven
years
old
her
lively
memory
showed
her
the
old
gray
heads
of
the
masters
who
taught
and
tormented
her
she
remembered
the
person
of
her
father
she
saw
him
getting
off
his
mule
at
the
door
of
the
and
taking
her
by
the
hand
to
lead
her
up
the
stairs
she
recalled
how
her
prattle
drove
from
his
brow
the
judicial
cares
he
did
not
always
lay
aside
with
his
black
or
his
red
robes
the
white
fur
of
which
fell
one
day
by
chance
under
the
snipping
of
her
mischievous
scissors
she
cast
but
one
glance
at
the
confessor
of
her
aunt
the
of
a
convent
of
poor
clares
a
rigid
and
fanatical
old
man
whose
duty
it
was
to
initiate
her
into
the
mysteries
of
religion
hardened
by
the
severities
necessary
against
heretics
the
old
priest
never
ceased
to
jangle
the
chains
of
hell
he
told
her
of
nothing
but
the
vengeance
of
heaven
and
made
her
tremble
with
the
assurance
that
god
s
eye
was
on
her
rendered
timid
she
dared
not
raise
her
eyes
in
the
priest
s
presence
and
ceased
to
have
any
feeling
but
respect
for
her
mother
whom
up
to
that
time
she
had
made
a
sharer
in
all
her
frolics
when
she
saw
that
beloved
mother
turning
her
blue
eyes
towards
her
with
an
appearance
of
anger
a
religious
terror
took
possession
of
the
girl
s
heart
then
suddenly
the
vision
took
her
to
the
second
period
of
her
childhood
when
as
yet
she
understood
nothing
of
the
things
of
life
she
thought
with
an
almost
mocking
regret
of
the
days
when
all
her
happiness
was
to
work
beside
her
mother
in
the
tapestried
salon
to
pray
in
the
church
to
sing
her
ballads
to
a
lute
to
read
in
secret
a
romance
of
chivalry
to
pluck
the
petals
of
a
flower
discover
what
gift
her
father
would
make
her
on
the
feast
of
the
blessed
and
find
out
the
meaning
of
speeches
repressed
before
her
passing
thus
from
her
childish
joys
through
the
sixteen
years
of
her
girlhood
the
grace
of
those
softly
flowing
years
when
she
knew
no
pain
was
eclipsed
by
the
brightness
of
a
memory
precious
though
the
joyous
peace
of
her
childhood
was
far
less
sweet
to
her
than
a
single
one
of
the
troubles
scattered
upon
the
last
two
years
of
her
childhood
years
that
were
rich
in
treasures
now
buried
forever
in
her
heart
the
vision
brought
her
suddenly
to
that
morning
that
ravishing
morning
when
in
the
grand
old
parlor
panelled
and
carved
in
oak
which
served
the
family
as
a
she
saw
her
handsome
cousin
for
the
first
time
alarmed
by
the
seditions
in
paris
her
mother
s
family
had
sent
the
young
courtier
to
rouen
hoping
that
he
could
there
be
trained
to
the
duties
of
the
magistracy
by
his
uncle
whose
office
might
some
day
devolve
upon
him
the
countess
smiled
involuntarily
as
she
remembered
the
haste
with
which
she
retired
on
seeing
this
relation
whom
she
did
not
know
but
in
spite
of
the
rapidity
with
which
she
opened
and
shut
the
door
a
single
glance
had
put
into
her
soul
so
vigorous
an
impression
of
the
scene
that
even
at
this
moment
she
seemed
to
see
it
still
occurring
her
eye
again
wandered
from
the
violet
velvet
mantle
embroidered
with
gold
and
lined
with
satin
to
the
spurs
on
the
boots
the
pretty
lozenges
slashed
into
the
doublet
the
and
the
rich
collaret
which
gave
to
view
a
throat
as
white
as
the
lace
around
it
she
stroked
with
her
hand
the
handsome
face
with
its
tiny
pointed
moustache
and
royale
as
small
as
the
ermine
tips
upon
her
father
s
hood
in
the
silence
of
the
night
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
green
silk
curtains
which
she
no
longer
saw
the
countess
forgetting
the
storm
her
husband
and
her
fears
recalled
the
days
which
seemed
to
her
longer
than
years
so
full
were
they
days
when
she
loved
and
was
beloved
and
the
moment
when
fearing
her
mother
s
sternness
she
had
slipped
one
morning
into
her
father
s
study
to
whisper
her
girlish
confidences
on
his
knee
waiting
for
his
smile
at
her
caresses
to
say
in
his
ear
will
you
scold
me
if
i
tell
you
something
once
more
she
heard
her
father
say
after
a
few
questions
in
reply
to
which
she
spoke
for
the
first
time
of
her
love
well
well
my
child
we
will
think
of
it
if
he
studies
well
if
he
fits
himself
to
succeed
me
if
he
continues
to
please
you
i
will
be
on
your
after
that
she
had
listened
no
longer
she
had
kissed
her
father
and
knocking
over
his
papers
as
she
ran
from
the
room
she
flew
to
the
great
where
daily
before
her
formidable
mother
rose
she
met
that
charming
cousin
georges
de
chaverny
faithfully
the
youth
promised
to
study
law
and
customs
he
laid
aside
the
splendid
trappings
of
the
nobility
of
the
sword
to
wear
the
sterner
costume
of
the
magistracy
i
like
you
better
in
black
she
said
it
was
a
falsehood
but
by
that
falsehood
she
comforted
her
lover
for
having
thrown
his
dagger
to
the
winds
the
memory
of
the
little
schemes
employed
to
deceive
her
mother
whose
severity
seemed
great
brought
back
to
her
the
soulful
joys
of
that
innocent
and
mutual
and
sanctioned
love
sometimes
a
rendezvous
beneath
the
linden
where
speech
could
be
freer
than
before
witnesses
sometimes
a
furtive
clasp
or
a
stolen
kiss
in
short
all
the
naive
instalments
of
a
passion
that
did
not
pass
the
bounds
of
modesty
reliving
in
her
vision
those
delightful
days
when
she
seemed
to
have
too
much
happiness
she
fancied
that
she
kissed
in
the
void
that
fine
young
face
with
the
glowing
eyes
that
rosy
mouth
that
spoke
so
well
of
love
yes
she
had
loved
chaverny
poor
apparently
but
what
treasures
had
she
not
discovered
in
that
soul
as
tender
as
it
was
strong
suddenly
her
father
died
chaverny
did
not
succeed
him
the
flames
of
civil
war
burst
forth
by
chaverny
s
care
she
and
her
mother
found
refuge
in
a
little
town
of
lower
normandy
soon
the
deaths
of
other
relatives
made
her
one
of
the
richest
heiresses
in
france
happiness
disappeared
as
wealth
came
to
her
the
savage
and
terrible
face
of
comte
d
herouville
who
asked
her
hand
rose
before
her
like
a
spreading
its
gloom
over
the
smiling
meadows
so
lately
gilded
by
the
sun
the
poor
countess
strove
to
cast
from
her
memory
the
scenes
of
weeping
and
despair
brought
about
by
her
long
resistance
at
last
came
an
awful
night
when
her
mother
pale
and
dying
threw
herself
at
her
daughter
s
feet
jeanne
could
save
chaverny
s
life
by
yielding
she
yielded
it
was
night
the
count
arriving
bloody
from
the
battlefield
was
there
all
was
ready
the
priest
the
altar
the
torches
jeanne
belonged
henceforth
to
misery
scarcely
had
she
time
to
say
to
her
young
cousin
who
was
set
at
liberty
georges
if
you
love
me
never
see
me
again
she
heard
the
departing
steps
of
her
lover
whom
in
truth
she
never
saw
again
but
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
she
still
kept
sacred
his
last
look
which
returned
perpetually
in
her
dreams
and
illumined
them
living
like
a
cat
shut
into
a
lion
s
cage
the
young
wife
dreaded
at
all
hours
the
claws
of
the
master
which
ever
threatened
her
she
knew
that
in
order
to
be
happy
she
must
forget
the
past
and
think
only
of
the
future
but
there
were
days
consecrated
to
the
memory
of
some
vanished
joy
when
she
deliberately
made
it
a
crime
to
put
on
the
gown
she
had
worn
on
the
day
she
had
seen
her
lover
for
the
first
time
i
am
not
guilty
she
said
but
if
i
seem
guilty
to
the
count
it
is
as
if
i
were
so
perhaps
i
am
the
holy
virgin
conceived
without
she
stopped
during
this
moment
when
her
thoughts
were
misty
and
her
soul
floated
in
a
region
of
fantasy
her
naivete
made
her
attribute
to
that
last
look
with
which
her
lover
transfixed
her
the
occult
power
of
the
visitation
of
the
angel
to
the
mother
of
her
lord
this
supposition
worthy
of
the
days
of
innocence
to
which
her
reverie
had
carried
her
back
vanished
before
the
memory
of
a
conjugal
scene
more
odious
than
death
the
poor
countess
could
have
no
real
doubt
as
to
the
legitimacy
of
the
child
that
stirred
in
her
womb
the
night
of
her
marriage
reappeared
to
her
in
all
the
horror
if
its
agony
bringing
in
its
train
other
such
nights
and
sadder
days
ah
my
poor
chaverny
she
cried
weeping
you
so
respectful
so
gracious
you
were
always
kind
to
she
turned
her
eyes
to
her
husband
as
if
to
persuade
herself
that
that
harsh
face
contained
a
promise
of
mercy
dearly
brought
the
count
was
awake
his
yellow
eyes
clear
as
those
of
a
tiger
glittered
beneath
their
tufted
eyebrows
and
never
had
his
glance
been
so
incisive
the
countess
terrified
at
having
encountered
it
slid
back
under
the
great
counterpane
and
was
motionless
why
are
you
weeping
said
the
count
pulling
away
the
covering
which
hid
his
wife
that
voice
always
a
terror
to
her
had
a
specious
softness
at
this
moment
which
seemed
to
her
of
good
augury
i
suffer
much
she
answered
well
my
pretty
one
it
is
no
crime
to
suffer
why
did
you
tremble
when
i
looked
at
you
alas
what
must
i
do
to
be
loved
the
wrinkles
of
his
forehead
between
the
eyebrows
deepened
i
see
plainly
you
are
afraid
of
me
he
added
sighing
prompted
by
the
instinct
of
feeble
natures
the
countess
interrupted
the
count
by
moans
exclaiming
i
fear
a
miscarriage
i
clambered
over
the
rocks
last
evening
and
tired
hearing
those
words
the
count
cast
so
horribly
suspicious
a
look
upon
his
wife
that
she
reddened
and
shuddered
he
mistook
the
fear
of
the
innocent
creature
for
remorse
perhaps
it
is
the
beginning
of
a
regular
childbirth
he
said
what
then
she
said
in
any
case
i
must
have
a
proper
man
here
he
said
i
will
fetch
the
gloomy
look
which
accompanied
these
words
overcame
the
countess
who
fell
back
in
the
bed
with
a
moan
caused
more
by
a
sense
of
her
fate
than
by
the
agony
of
the
coming
crisis
that
moan
convinced
the
count
of
the
justice
of
the
suspicions
that
were
rising
in
his
mind
affecting
a
calmness
which
the
tones
of
his
voice
his
gestures
and
looks
contradicted
he
rose
hastily
wrapped
himself
in
a
which
lay
on
a
chair
and
began
by
locking
a
door
near
the
chimney
through
which
the
state
bedroom
was
entered
from
the
reception
rooms
which
communicated
with
the
great
staircase
seeing
her
husband
pocket
that
key
the
countess
had
a
presentiment
of
danger
she
next
heard
him
open
the
door
opposite
to
that
which
he
had
just
locked
and
enter
a
room
where
the
counts
of
herouville
slept
when
they
did
not
honor
their
wives
with
their
noble
company
the
countess
knew
of
that
room
only
by
hearsay
jealousy
kept
her
husband
always
with
her
if
occasionally
some
military
expedition
forced
him
to
leave
her
the
count
left
more
than
one
argus
whose
incessant
spying
proved
his
shameful
distrust
in
spite
of
the
attention
the
countess
now
gave
to
the
slightest
noise
she
heard
nothing
more
the
count
had
in
fact
entered
a
long
gallery
leading
from
his
room
which
continued
down
the
western
wing
of
the
castle
cardinal
d
herouville
his
a
passionate
lover
of
the
works
of
printing
had
there
collected
a
library
as
interesting
for
the
number
as
for
the
beauty
of
its
volumes
and
prudence
had
caused
him
to
build
into
the
walls
one
of
those
curious
inventions
suggested
by
solitude

a
silver
chain
set
in
motion
by
means
of
invisible
wires
a
bell
placed
at
the
bed
s
head
of
a
faithful
servitor
the
count
now
pulled
the
chain
and
the
boots
and
spurs
of
the
man
on
duty
sounded
on
the
stone
steps
of
a
spiral
staircase
placed
in
the
tall
tower
which
flanked
the
western
corner
of
the
chateau
on
the
ocean
side
when
the
count
heard
the
steps
of
his
retainer
he
pulled
back
the
rusty
bolts
which
protected
the
door
leading
from
the
gallery
to
the
tower
admitting
into
the
sanctuary
of
learning
a
man
of
arms
whose
stalwart
appearance
was
in
keeping
with
that
of
his
master
this
man
scarcely
awakened
seemed
to
have
walked
there
by
instinct
the
horn
lantern
which
he
held
in
his
hand
threw
so
feeble
a
gleam
down
the
long
library
that
his
master
and
he
appeared
in
that
visible
darkness
like
two
phantoms
saddle
my
instantly
and
come
with
me
this
order
was
given
in
a
deep
tone
which
roused
the
man
s
intelligence
he
raised
his
eyes
to
those
of
his
master
and
encountered
so
piercing
a
look
that
the
effect
was
that
of
an
electric
shock
bertrand
added
the
count
laying
his
right

off
your

of

monseigneur
what
disguise
myself
as
a
leaguer
excuse
me
i
will
obey
you
but
i
would
rather
be
the
count
smiled
then
to
efface
that
smile
which
contrasted
with
the
expression
of
his
face
he
answered
roughly
choose
the
strongest
horse
there
is
in
the
stable
and
follow
me
we
shall
ride
like
balls
shot
from

i
will
ring
to
let
you
bertrand
bowed
in
silence
and
went
away
but
when
he
had
gone
a
few
steps
he
said
to
himself
as
he
listened
to
the
howling
of
the
storm
all
the
devils
are
abroad
jarnidieu
i
d
have
been
surprised
to
see
this
one
stay
quietly
in
his
bed
we
took
in
just
such
a
tempest
as
the
count
kept
in
his
room
a
disguise
which
often
served
him
in
his
campaign
stratagems
putting
on
the
shabby
that
looked
as
thought
it
might
belong
to
one
of
the
poor
whose
pittance
was
so
seldom
paid
by
henri
he
returned
to
the
room
where
his
wife
was
moaning
try
to
suffer
patiently
he
said
to
her
i
will
founder
my
horse
if
necessary
to
bring
you
speedy
these
words
were
certainly
not
alarming
and
the
countess
emboldened
by
them
was
about
to
make
a
request
when
the
count
asked
her
suddenly
tell
me
where
you
keep
your
masks
my
masks
she
replied
good
god
what
do
you
want
to
do
with
them
where
are
they
he
repeated
with
his
usual
violence
in
the
chest
she
said
she
shuddered
when
she
saw
her
husband
select
from
among
her
masks
a
touret
de
nez
the
wearing
of
which
was
as
common
among
the
ladies
of
that
time
as
the
wearing
of
gloves
in
our
day
the
count
became
entirely
unrecognizable
after
he
had
put
on
an
old
gray
felt
hat
with
a
broken
cock
s
feather
on
his
head
he
girded
round
his
loins
a
broad
leathern
belt
in
which
he
stuck
a
dagger
which
he
did
not
wear
habitually
these
miserable
garments
gave
him
so
terrifying
an
air
and
he
approached
the
bed
with
so
strange
a
motion
that
the
countess
thought
her
last
hour
had
come
ah
don
t
kill
us
she
cried
leave
me
my
child
and
i
will
love
you
you
must
feel
yourself
very
guilty
to
offer
as
the
ransom
of
your
faults
the
love
you
owe
the
count
s
voice
was
lugubrious
and
the
bitter
words
were
enforced
by
a
look
which
fell
like
lead
upon
the
countess
my
god
she
cried
sorrowfully
can
innocence
be
fatal
your
death
is
not
in
question
said
her
master
coming
out
of
a
sort
of
reverie
into
which
he
had
fallen
you
are
to
do
exactly
and
for
love
of
me
what
i
shall
now
tell
he
flung
upon
the
bed
one
of
the
two
masks
he
had
taken
from
the
chest
and
smiled
with
derision
as
he
saw
the
gesture
of
involuntary
fear
which
the
slight
shock
of
the
black
velvet
wrung
from
his
wife
you
will
give
me
a
puny
child
he
cried
wear
that
mask
on
your
face
when
i
return
i
ll
have
no
boast
that
he
has
seen
the
comtesse
d
a
man
why
choose
a
man
for
the
purpose
she
said
in
a
feeble
voice
ho
ho
my
lady
am
i
not
master
here
replied
the
count
what
matters
one
horror
the
more
murmured
the
countess
but
her
master
had
disappeared
and
the
exclamation
did
her
no
injury
presently
in
a
brief
lull
of
the
storm
the
countess
heard
the
gallop
of
two
horses
which
seemed
to
fly
across
the
sandy
dunes
by
which
the
castle
was
surrounded
the
sound
was
quickly
lost
in
that
of
the
waves
soon
she
felt
herself
a
prisoner
in
the
vast
apartment
alone
in
the
midst
of
a
night
both
silent
and
threatening
and
without
succor
against
an
evil
she
saw
approaching
her
with
rapid
strides
in
vain
she
sought
for
some
stratagem
by
which
to
save
that
child
conceived
in
tears
already
her
consolation
the
spring
of
all
her
thoughts
the
future
of
her
affections
her
one
frail
hope
sustained
by
maternal
courage
she
took
the
horn
with
which
her
husband
summoned
his
men
and
opening
a
window
blew
through
the
brass
tube
feeble
notes
that
died
away
upon
the
vast
expanse
of
water
like
a
bubble
blown
into
the
air
by
a
child
she
felt
the
uselessness
of
that
moan
unheard
of
men
and
turned
to
hasten
through
the
apartments
hoping
that
all
the
issues
were
not
closed
upon
her
reaching
the
library
she
sought
in
vain
for
some
secret
passage
then
passing
between
the
long
rows
of
books
she
reached
a
window
which
looked
upon
the
courtyard
again
she
sounded
the
horn
but
without
success
against
the
voice
of
the
hurricane
in
her
helplessness
she
thought
of
trusting
herself
to
one
of
the
women
all
creatures
of
her
husband
when
passing
into
her
oratory
she
found
that
the
count
had
locked
the
only
door
that
led
to
their
apartments
this
was
a
horrible
discovery
such
precautions
taken
to
isolate
her
showed
a
desire
to
proceed
without
witnesses
to
some
horrible
execution
as
moment
after
moment
she
lost
hope
the
pangs
of
childbirth
grew
stronger
and
keener
a
presentiment
of
murder
joined
to
the
fatigue
of
her
efforts
overcame
her
last
remaining
strength
she
was
like
a
shipwrecked
man
who
sinks
borne
under
by
one
last
wave
less
furious
than
others
he
has
vanquished
the
bewildering
pangs
of
her
condition
kept
her
from
knowing
the
lapse
of
time
at
the
moment
when
she
felt
that
alone
without
help
she
was
about
to
give
birth
to
her
child
and
to
all
her
other
terrors
was
added
that
of
the
accidents
to
which
her
ignorance
exposed
her
the
count
appeared
without
a
sound
that
let
her
know
of
his
arrival
the
man
was
there
like
a
demon
claiming
at
the
close
of
a
compact
the
soul
that
was
sold
to
him
he
muttered
angrily
at
finding
his
wife
s
face
uncovered
then
after
masking
her
carefully
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
laid
her
on
the
bed
in
her
chamber
chapter
ii
the
bonesetter
the
terror
of
that
apparition
and
hasty
removal
stopped
for
a
moment
the
physical
sufferings
of
the
countess
and
so
enabled
her
to
cast
a
furtive
glance
at
the
actors
in
this
mysterious
scene
she
did
not
recognize
bertrand
who
was
there
disguised
and
masked
as
carefully
as
his
master
after
lighting
in
haste
some
candles
the
light
of
which
mingled
with
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
which
were
reddening
the
window
panes
the
old
servitor
had
gone
to
the
embrasure
of
a
window
and
stood
leaning
against
a
corner
of
it
there
with
his
face
towards
the
wall
he
seemed
to
be
estimating
its
thickness
keeping
his
body
in
such
absolute
immobility
that
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
statue
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
countess
beheld
a
short
stout
man
apparently
out
of
breath
and
stupefied
whose
eyes
were
blindfolded
and
his
features
so
distorted
with
terror
that
it
was
impossible
to
guess
at
their
natural
expression
god
s
death
you
scamp
said
the
count
giving
him
back
his
eyesight
by
a
rough
movement
which
threw
upon
the
man
s
neck
the
bandage
that
had
been
upon
his
eyes
i
warn
you
not
to
look
at
anything
but
the
wretched
woman
on
whom
you
are
now
to
exercise
your
skill
if
you
do
i
ll
fling
you
into
the
river
that
flows
beneath
those
windows
with
a
collar
round
your
neck
weighing
a
hundred
pounds
with
that
he
pulled
down
upon
the
breast
of
his
stupefied
hearer
the
cravat
with
which
his
eyes
had
been
bandaged
examine
first
if
this
can
be
a
miscarriage
he
continued
in
which
case
your
life
will
answer
to
me
for
the
mother
s
but
if
the
child
is
living
you
are
to
bring
it
to
so
saying
the
count
seized
the
poor
operator
by
the
body
and
placed
him
before
the
countess
then
he
went
himself
to
the
depths
of
a
and
began
to
drum
with
his
fingers
upon
the
panes
casting
glances
alternately
on
his
on
the
bed
and
at
the
ocean
as
if
he
were
pledging
to
the
expected
child
a
cradle
in
the
waves
the
man
whom
with
outrageous
violence
the
count
and
bertrand
had
snatched
from
his
bed
and
fastened
to
the
crupper
of
the
latter
s
horse
was
a
personage
whose
individuality
may
serve
to
characterize
the
period
a
man
moreover
whose
influence
was
destined
to
make
itself
felt
in
the
house
of
herouville
never
in
any
age
were
the
nobles
so
little
informed
as
to
natural
science
and
never
was
judicial
astrology
held
in
greater
honor
for
at
no
period
in
history
was
there
a
greater
general
desire
to
know
the
future
this
ignorance
and
this
curiosity
had
led
to
the
utmost
confusion
in
human
knowledge
all
things
were
still
mere
personal
experience
the
nomenclatures
of
theory
did
not
exist
printing
was
done
at
enormous
cost
scientific
communication
had
little
or
no
facility
the
church
persecuted
science
and
all
research
which
was
based
on
the
analysis
of
natural
phenomena
persecution
begat
mystery
so
to
the
people
as
well
as
to
the
nobles
physician
and
alchemist
mathematician
and
astronomer
astrologer
and
necromancer
were
six
attributes
all
meeting
in
the
single
person
of
the
physician
in
those
days
a
superior
physician
was
supposed
to
be
cultivating
magic
while
curing
his
patient
he
was
drawing
their
horoscopes
princes
protected
the
men
of
genius
who
were
willing
to
reveal
the
future
they
lodged
them
in
their
palaces
and
pensioned
them
the
famous
cornelius
agrippa
who
came
to
france
to
become
the
physician
of
henri
would
not
consent
as
nostradamus
did
to
predict
the
future
and
for
this
reason
he
was
dismissed
by
catherine
de
medici
who
replaced
him
with
cosmo
ruggiero
the
men
of
science
who
were
superior
to
their
times
were
therefore
seldom
appreciated
they
simply
inspired
an
ignorant
fear
of
occult
sciences
and
their
results
without
being
precisely
one
of
the
famous
mathematicians
the
man
whom
the
count
had
brought
enjoyed
in
normandy
the
equivocal
reputation
which
attached
to
a
physician
who
was
known
to
do
mysterious
works
he
belonged
to
the
class
of
sorcerers
who
are
still
called
in
parts
of
france
this
name
belonged
to
certain
untutored
geniuses
who
without
apparent
study
but
by
means
of
hereditary
knowledge
and
the
effect
of
long
practice
the
observations
of
which
accumulated
in
the
family
were
bonesetters
that
is
they
mended
broken
limbs
and
cured
both
men
and
beasts
of
certain
maladies
possessing
secrets
said
to
be
marvellous
for
the
treatment
of
serious
cases
but
not
only
had
maitre
antoine
beauvouloir
the
name
of
the
present
bonesetter
a
father
and
grandfather
who
were
famous
practitioners
from
whom
he
inherited
important
traditions
he
was
also
learned
in
medicine
and
was
given
to
the
study
of
natural
science
the
country
people
saw
his
study
full
of
books
and
other
strange
things
which
gave
to
his
successes
a
coloring
of
magic
without
passing
strictly
for
a
sorcerer
antoine
beauvouloir
impressed
the
populace
through
a
circumference
of
a
hundred
miles
with
respect
akin
to
terror
and
what
was
far
more
really
dangerous
for
himself
he
held
in
his
power
many
secrets
of
life
and
death
which
concerned
the
noble
families
of
that
region
like
his
father
and
grandfather
before
him
he
was
celebrated
for
his
skill
in
confinements
and
miscarriages
in
those
days
of
unbridled
disorder
crimes
were
so
frequent
and
passions
so
violent
that
the
higher
nobility
often
found
itself
compelled
to
initiate
maitre
antoine
beauvouloir
into
secrets
both
shameful
and
terrible
his
discretion
so
essential
to
his
safety
was
absolute
consequently
his
clients
paid
him
well
and
his
hereditary
practice
greatly
increased
always
on
the
road
sometimes
roused
in
the
dead
of
night
as
on
this
occasion
by
the
count
sometimes
obliged
to
spend
several
days
with
certain
great
ladies
he
had
never
married
in
fact
his
reputation
had
hindered
certain
young
women
from
accepting
him
incapable
of
finding
consolation
in
the
practice
of
his
profession
which
gave
him
such
power
over
feminine
weakness
the
poor
bonesetter
felt
himself
born
for
the
joys
of
family
and
yet
was
unable
to
obtain
them
the
good
man
s
excellent
heart
was
concealed
by
a
misleading
appearance
of
joviality
in
keeping
with
his
puffy
cheeks
and
rotund
figure
the
vivacity
of
his
fat
little
body
and
the
frankness
of
his
speech
he
was
anxious
to
marry
that
he
might
have
a
daughter
who
should
transfer
his
property
to
some
poor
noble
he
did
not
like
his
station
as
bonesetter
and
wished
to
rescue
his
family
name
from
the
position
in
which
the
prejudices
of
the
times
had
placed
it
he
himself
took
willingly
enough
to
the
feasts
and
jovialities
which
usually
followed
his
principal
operations
the
habit
of
being
on
such
occasions
the
most
important
personage
in
the
company
had
added
to
his
natural
gaiety
a
sufficient
dose
of
serious
vanity
his
impertinences
were
usually
well
received
in
crucial
moments
when
it
often
pleased
him
to
perform
his
operations
with
a
certain
slow
majesty
he
was
in
other
respects
as
inquisitive
as
a
nightingale
as
greedy
as
a
hound
and
as
garrulous
as
all
diplomatists
who
talk
incessantly
and
betray
no
secrets
in
spite
of
these
defects
developed
in
him
by
the
endless
adventures
into
which
his
profession
led
him
antoine
beauvouloir
was
held
to
be
the
least
bad
man
in
normandy
though
he
belonged
to
the
small
number
of
minds
who
are
superior
to
their
epoch
the
strong
good
sense
of
a
norman
countryman
warned
him
to
conceal
the
ideas
he
acquired
and
the
truths
he
from
time
to
time
discovered
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
placed
by
the
count
in
presence
of
a
woman
in
childbirth
the
bonesetter
recovered
his
presence
of
mind
he
felt
the
pulse
of
the
masked
lady
not
that
he
gave
it
a
single
thought
but
under
cover
of
that
medical
action
he
could
reflect
and
he
did
reflect
on
his
own
situation
in
none
of
the
shameful
and
criminal
intrigues
in
which
superior
force
had
compelled
him
to
act
as
a
blind
instrument
had
precautions
been
taken
with
such
mystery
as
in
this
case
though
his
death
had
often
been
threatened
as
a
means
of
assuring
the
secrecy
of
enterprises
in
which
he
had
taken
part
against
his
will
his
life
had
never
been
so
endangered
as
at
that
moment
he
resolved
before
all
things
to
find
out
who
it
was
who
now
employed
him
and
to
discover
the
actual
extent
of
his
danger
in
order
to
save
if
possible
his
own
little
person
what
is
the
trouble
he
said
to
the
countess
in
a
low
voice
as
he
placed
her
in
a
manner
to
receive
his
help
do
not
give
him
the
child
speak
loud
cried
the
count
in
thundering
tones
which
prevented
beauvouloir
from
hearing
the
last
word
uttered
by
the
countess
if
not
added
the
count
who
was
careful
to
disguise
his
voice
say
your
in
complain
aloud
said
the
leech
to
the
lady
cry
scream
jarnidieu
that
man
has
a
necklace
that
won
t
fit
you
any
better
than
me
courage
my
little
lady
touch
her
lightly
cried
the
count
monsieur
is
jealous
said
the
operator
in
a
shrill
voice
fortunately
drowned
by
the
countess
s
cries
for
maitre
beauvouloir
s
safety
nature
was
merciful
it
was
more
a
miscarriage
than
a
regular
birth
and
the
child
was
so
puny
that
it
caused
little
suffering
to
the
mother
holy
virgin
cried
the
bonesetter
it
isn
t
a
miscarriage
after
all
the
count
made
the
floor
shake
as
he
stamped
with
rage
the
countess
pinched
beauvouloir
ah
i
see
he
said
to
himself
it
ought
to
be
a
premature
birth
ought
it
he
whispered
to
the
countess
who
replied
with
an
affirmative
sign
as
if
that
gesture
were
the
only
language
in
which
to
express
her
thoughts
it
is
not
all
clear
to
me
yet
thought
the
bonesetter
like
all
men
in
constant
practice
he
recognized
at
once
a
woman
in
her
first
trouble
as
he
called
it
though
the
modest
inexperience
of
certain
gestures
showed
him
the
virgin
ignorance
of
the
countess
the
mischievous
operator
exclaimed
madame
is
delivered
as
if
she
knew
all
about
it
the
count
then
said
with
a
calmness
more
terrifying
than
his
anger
give
me
the
don
t
give
it
him
for
the
love
of
god
cried
the
mother
whose
almost
savage
cry
awoke
in
the
heart
of
the
little
man
a
courageous
pity
which
attached
him
more
than
he
knew
himself
to
the
helpless
infant
rejected
by
his
father
the
child
is
not
yet
born
you
are
counting
your
chicken
before
it
is
hatched
he
said
coldly
hiding
the
infant
surprised
to
hear
no
cries
he
examined
the
child
thinking
it
dead
the
count
seeing
the
deception
sprang
upon
him
with
one
bound
god
of
heaven
will
you
give
it
to
me
he
cried
snatching
the
hapless
victim
which
uttered
feeble
cries
take
care
the
child
is
deformed
and
almost
lifeless
it
is
a
seven
months
child
said
beauvouloir
clinging
to
the
count
s
arm
then
with
a
strength
given
to
him
by
the
excitement
of
his
pity
he
clung
to
the
father
s
fingers
whispering
in
a
broken
voice
spare
yourself
a
crime
the
child
can
not
wretch
replied
the
count
from
whose
hands
the
bonesetter
had
wrenched
the
child
who
told
you
that
i
wished
to
kill
my
son
could
i
not
caress
it
wait
till
he
is
eighteen
years
old
to
caress
him
in
that
way
replied
beauvouloir
recovering
the
sense
of
his
importance
but
he
added
thinking
of
his
own
safety
for
he
had
recognized
the
comte
d
herouville
who
in
his
rage
had
forgotten
to
disguise
his
voice
have
him
baptized
at
once
and
do
not
speak
of
his
danger
to
the
mother
or
you
will
kill
the
gesture
of
satisfaction
which
escaped
the
count
when
the
child
s
death
was
prophesied
suggested
this
speech
to
the
bonesetter
as
the
best
means
of
saving
the
child
at
the
moment
beauvouloir
now
hastened
to
carry
the
infant
back
to
its
mother
who
had
fainted
and
he
pointed
to
her
condition
reprovingly
to
warn
the
count
of
the
results
of
his
violence
the
countess
had
heard
all
for
in
many
of
the
great
crises
of
life
the
human
organs
acquire
an
otherwise
unknown
delicacy
but
the
cries
of
the
child
laid
beside
her
on
the
bed
restored
her
to
life
as
if
by
magic
she
fancied
she
heard
the
voices
of
angels
when
under
cover
of
the
whimperings
of
the
babe
the
bonesetter
said
in
her
ear
take
care
of
him
and
he
ll
live
a
hundred
years
beauvouloir
knows
what
he
is
talking
a
celestial
sigh
a
silent
pressure
of
the
hand
were
the
reward
of
the
leech
who
had
looked
to
see
before
yielding
the
frail
little
creature
to
its
mother
s
embrace
whether
that
of
the
father
had
done
no
harm
to
its
puny
organization
the
motion
with
which
the
mother
hid
her
son
beside
her
and
the
threatening
glance
she
cast
upon
the
count
through
the
of
her
mask
made
beauvouloir
shudder
she
will
die
if
she
loses
that
child
too
soon
he
said
to
the
count
during
the
latter
part
of
this
scene
the
lord
of
herouville
seemed
to
hear
and
see
nothing
rigid
and
as
if
absorbed
in
meditation
he
stood
by
the
window
drumming
on
its
panes
but
he
turned
at
the
last
words
uttered
by
the
bonesetter
with
an
almost
frenzied
motion
and
came
to
him
with
uplifted
dagger
miserable
clown
he
cried
giving
him
the
opprobrious
name
by
which
the
royalists
insulted
the
leaguers
impudent
scoundrel
your
science
which
makes
you
the
accomplice
of
men
who
steal
inheritances
is
all
that
prevents
me
from
depriving
normandy
of
her
so
saying
and
to
beauvouloir
s
great
satisfaction
the
count
replaced
the
dagger
in
its
sheath
could
you
not
continued
the
count
find
yourself
for
once
in
your
life
in
the
honorable
company
of
a
noble
and
his
wife
without
suspecting
them
of
the
base
crimes
and
trickery
of
your
own
kind
kill
my
son
take
him
from
his
mother
where
did
you
get
such
crazy
ideas
am
i
a
madman
why
do
you
attempt
to
frighten
me
about
the
life
of
that
vigorous
child
fool
i
defy
your
silly
talk
but
remember
this
since
you
are
here
your
miserable
life
shall
answer
for
that
of
the
mother
and
the
the
bonesetter
was
puzzled
by
this
sudden
change
in
the
count
s
intentions
this
show
of
tenderness
for
the
infant
alarmed
him
far
more
than
the
impatient
cruelty
and
savage
indifference
hitherto
manifested
by
the
count
whose
tone
in
pronouncing
the
last
words
seemed
to
beauvouloir
to
point
to
some
better
scheme
for
reaching
his
infernal
ends
the
shrewd
practitioner
turned
this
idea
over
in
his
mind
until
a
light
struck
him
i
have
it
he
said
to
himself
this
great
and
good
noble
does
not
want
to
make
himself
odious
to
his
wife
he
ll
trust
to
the
vials
of
the
apothecary
i
must
warn
the
lady
to
see
to
the
food
and
medicine
of
her
as
he
turned
toward
the
bed
the
count
who
had
opened
a
closet
stopped
him
with
an
imperious
gesture
holding
out
a
purse
beauvouloir
saw
within
its
red
silk
meshes
a
quantity
of
gold
which
the
count
now
flung
to
him
contemptuously
though
you
make
me
out
a
villain
i
am
not
released
from
the
obligation
of
paying
you
like
a
lord
i
shall
not
ask
you
to
be
discreet
this
man
here
pointing
to
bertrand
will
explain
to
you
that
there
are
rivers
and
trees
everywhere
for
miserable
wretches
who
chatter
of
so
saying
the
count
advanced
slowly
to
the
bonesetter
pushed
a
chair
noisily
toward
him
as
if
to
invite
him
to
sit
down
as
he
did
himself
by
the
bedside
then
he
said
to
his
wife
in
a
specious
voice
well
my
pretty
one
so
we
have
a
son
this
is
a
joyful
thing
for
us
do
you
suffer
much
no
murmured
the
countess
the
evident
surprise
of
the
mother
and
the
tardy
demonstrations
of
pleasure
on
the
part
of
the
father
convinced
beauvouloir
that
there
was
some
incident
behind
all
this
which
escaped
his
penetration
he
persisted
in
his
suspicion
and
rested
his
hand
on
that
of
the
young
wife
less
to
watch
her
condition
than
to
convey
to
her
some
advice
the
skin
is
good
i
fear
nothing
for
madame
the
milk
fever
will
come
of
course
but
you
need
not
be
alarmed
that
is
at
this
point
the
wily
bonesetter
paused
and
pressed
the
hand
of
the
countess
to
make
her
attentive
to
his
words
if
you
wish
to
avoid
all
anxiety
about
your
son
madame
he
continued
never
leave
him
suckle
him
yourself
and
beware
of
the
drugs
of
apothecaries
the
mother
s
breast
is
the
remedy
for
all
the
ills
of
infancy
i
have
seen
many
births
of
seven
months
children
but
i
never
saw
any
so
little
painful
as
this
but
that
is
not
surprising
the
child
is
so
small
you
could
put
him
in
a
wooden
shoe
i
am
certain
he
doesn
t
weight
more
than
sixteen
ounces
milk
milk
milk
keep
him
always
on
your
breast
and
you
will
save
these
last
words
were
accompanied
by
a
significant
pressure
of
the
fingers
disregarding
the
yellow
flames
flashing
from
the
eyeholes
of
the
count
s
mask
beauvouloir
uttered
these
words
with
the
serious
imperturbability
of
a
man
who
intends
to
earn
his
money
ho
ho
bonesetter
you
are
leaving
your
old
felt
hat
behind
you
said
bertrand
as
the
two
left
the
bedroom
together
the
reasons
of
the
sudden
mercy
which
the
count
had
shown
to
his
son
were
to
be
found
in
a
notary
s
office
at
the
moment
when
beauvouloir
arrested
his
murderous
hand
avarice
and
the
legal
custom
of
normandy
rose
up
before
him
those
mighty
powers
stiffened
his
fingers
and
silenced
the
passion
of
his
hatred
one
cried
out
to
him
the
property
of
your
wife
can
not
belong
to
the
house
of
herouville
except
through
a
male
the
other
pointed
to
a
dying
countess
and
her
fortune
claimed
by
the
collateral
heirs
of
the
both
advised
him
to
leave
to
nature
the
extinction
of
that
hated
child
and
to
wait
the
birth
of
a
second
son
who
might
be
healthy
and
vigorous
before
getting
rid
of
his
wife
and
he
saw
neither
wife
nor
child
he
saw
the
estates
only
and
hatred
was
softened
by
ambition
the
mother
who
knew
his
nature
was
even
more
surprised
than
the
bonesetter
and
she
still
retained
her
instinctive
fears
showing
them
at
times
openly
for
the
courage
of
mothers
seemed
suddenly
to
have
doubled
her
strength
chapter
iii
the
mother
s
love
for
several
days
the
count
remained
assiduously
beside
his
wife
showing
her
attentions
to
which
imparted
a
sort
of
tenderness
the
countess
saw
however
that
she
alone
was
the
object
of
these
attentions
the
hatred
of
the
father
for
his
son
showed
itself
in
every
detail
he
abstained
from
looking
at
him
or
touching
him
he
would
rise
abruptly
and
leave
the
room
if
the
child
cried
in
short
he
seemed
to
endure
it
living
only
through
the
hope
of
seeing
it
die
but
even
this
was
galling
to
the
count
the
day
on
which
he
saw
that
the
mother
s
intelligent
eye
perceived
without
fully
comprehending
the
danger
that
threatened
her
son
he
announced
his
departure
on
the
morning
after
the
mass
for
her
churching
was
solemnized
under
pretext
of
rallying
his
forces
to
the
support
of
the
king
such
were
the
circumstances
which
preceded
and
accompanied
the
birth
of
etienne
d
herouville
if
the
count
had
no
other
reason
for
wishing
the
death
of
this
disowned
son
poor
etienne
would
still
have
been
the
object
of
his
aversion
in
his
eyes
the
misfortune
of
a
rickety
sickly
constitution
was
a
flagrant
offence
to
his
as
a
father
if
he
execrated
handsome
men
he
also
detested
weakly
ones
in
whom
mental
capacity
took
the
place
of
physical
strength
to
please
him
a
man
should
be
ugly
in
face
tall
robust
and
ignorant
etienne
whose
debility
would
bow
him
as
it
were
to
the
sedentary
occupations
of
knowledge
was
certain
to
find
in
his
father
a
natural
enemy
his
struggle
with
that
colossus
began
therefore
from
his
cradle
and
his
sole
support
against
that
cruel
antagonist
was
the
heart
of
his
mother
whose
love
increased
by
a
tender
law
of
nature
as
perils
threatened
him
buried
in
solitude
after
the
abrupt
departure
of
the
count
jeanne
de
owed
to
her
child
the
only
semblance
of
happiness
that
consoled
her
life
she
loved
him
as
women
love
the
child
of
an
illicit
love
obliged
to
suckle
him
the
duty
never
wearied
her
she
would
not
let
her
women
care
for
the
child
she
dressed
and
undressed
him
finding
fresh
pleasures
in
every
little
care
that
he
required
happiness
glowed
upon
her
face
as
she
obeyed
the
needs
of
the
little
being
as
etienne
had
come
into
the
world
prematurely
no
clothes
were
ready
for
him
and
those
that
were
needed
she
made
herself
with
what
perfection
you
know
ye
mothers
who
have
worked
in
silence
for
a
treasured
child
the
days
had
never
hours
long
enough
for
these
manifold
occupations
and
the
minute
precautions
of
the
nursing
mother
those
days
fled
by
laden
with
her
secret
content
the
counsel
of
the
bonesetter
still
continued
in
the
countess
s
mind
she
feared
for
her
child
and
would
gladly
not
have
slept
in
order
to
be
sure
that
no
one
approached
him
during
her
sleep
and
she
kept
his
cradle
beside
her
bed
in
the
absence
of
the
count
she
ventured
to
send
for
the
bonesetter
whose
name
she
had
caught
and
remembered
to
her
beauvouloir
was
a
being
to
whom
she
owed
an
untold
debt
of
gratitude
and
she
desired
of
all
things
to
question
him
on
certain
points
relating
to
her
son
if
an
attempt
were
made
to
poison
him
how
should
she
foil
it
in
what
way
ought
she
to
manage
his
frail
constitution
was
it
well
to
nurse
him
long
if
she
died
would
beauvouloir
undertake
the
care
of
the
poor
child
s
health
to
the
questions
of
the
countess
beauvouloir
deeply
touched
replied
that
he
feared
as
much
as
she
did
an
attempt
to
poison
etienne
but
there
was
he
assured
her
no
danger
as
long
as
she
nursed
the
child
and
in
future
when
obliged
to
feed
him
she
must
taste
the
food
herself
if
madame
la
comtesse
he
said
feels
anything
strange
upon
her
tongue
a
prickly
bitter
strong
salt
taste
reject
the
food
let
the
child
s
clothes
be
washed
under
her
own
eye
and
let
her
keep
the
key
of
the
chest
which
contains
them
should
anything
happen
to
the
child
send
instantly
to
these
instructions
sank
deep
into
jeanne
s
heart
she
begged
beauvouloir
to
regard
her
always
as
one
who
would
do
him
any
service
in
her
power
on
that
the
poor
man
told
her
that
she
held
his
happiness
in
her
hands
then
he
related
briefly
how
the
comte
d
herouville
had
in
his
youth
loved
a
courtesan
known
by
the
name
of
la
belle
romaine
who
had
formerly
belonged
to
the
cardinal
of
lorraine
abandoned
by
the
count
before
very
long
she
had
died
miserably
leaving
a
child
named
gertrude
who
had
been
rescued
by
the
sisters
of
the
convent
of
poor
clares
the
mother
superior
of
which
was
mademoiselle
de
the
countess
s
aunt
having
been
called
to
treat
gertrude
for
an
illness
he
beauvouloir
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
and
if
madame
la
comtesse
he
said
would
undertake
the
affair
she
should
not
only
more
than
repay
him
for
what
she
thought
he
had
done
for
her
but
she
would
make
him
grateful
to
her
for
life
the
count
might
sooner
or
later
be
brought
to
take
an
interest
in
so
beautiful
a
daughter
and
might
protect
her
indirectly
by
making
him
his
physician
the
countess
compassionate
to
all
true
love
promised
to
do
her
best
and
pursued
the
affair
so
warmly
that
at
the
birth
of
her
second
son
she
did
obtain
from
her
husband
a
dot
for
the
young
girl
who
was
married
soon
after
to
beauvouloir
the
dot
and
his
savings
enabled
the
bonesetter
to
buy
a
charming
estate
called
forcalier
near
the
castle
of
herouville
and
to
give
his
life
the
dignity
of
a
student
and
man
of
learning
comforted
by
the
kind
physician
the
countess
felt
that
to
her
were
given
joys
unknown
to
other
mothers
mother
and
child
two
feeble
beings
seemed
united
in
one
thought
they
understood
each
other
long
before
language
could
interpret
between
them
from
the
moment
when
etienne
first
turned
his
eyes
on
things
about
him
with
the
stupid
eagerness
of
a
little
child
his
glance
had
rested
on
the
sombre
hangings
of
the
castle
walls
when
his
young
ear
strove
to
listen
and
to
distinguish
sounds
he
heard
the
monotonous
ebb
and
flow
of
the
sea
upon
the
rocks
as
regular
as
the
swinging
of
a
pendulum
thus
places
sounds
and
things
all
that
strikes
the
senses
and
forms
the
character
inclined
him
to
melancholy
his
mother
too
was
doomed
to
live
and
die
in
the
clouds
of
melancholy
and
to
him
from
his
birth
up
she
was
the
only
being
that
existed
on
the
earth
and
filled
for
him
the
desert
like
all
frail
children
etienne
s
attitude
was
passive
and
in
that
he
resembled
his
mother
the
delicacy
of
his
organs
was
such
that
a
sudden
noise
or
the
presence
of
a
boisterous
person
gave
him
a
sort
of
fever
he
was
like
those
little
insects
for
whom
god
seems
to
temper
the
violence
of
the
wind
and
the
heat
of
the
sun
incapable
like
them
of
struggling
against
the
slightest
obstacle
he
yielded
as
they
do
without
resistance
or
complaint
to
everything
that
seemed
to
him
aggressive
this
angelic
patience
inspired
in
the
mother
a
sentiment
which
took
away
all
fatigue
from
the
incessant
care
required
by
so
frail
a
being
soon
his
precocious
perception
of
suffering
revealed
to
him
the
power
that
he
had
upon
his
mother
often
he
tried
to
divert
her
with
caresses
and
make
her
smile
at
his
play
and
never
did
his
coaxing
hands
his
stammered
words
his
intelligent
laugh
fail
to
rouse
her
from
her
reverie
if
he
was
tired
his
care
for
her
kept
him
from
complaining
poor
dear
little
sensitive
cried
the
countess
as
he
fell
asleep
tired
with
some
play
which
had
driven
the
sad
memories
from
her
mind
how
can
you
live
in
this
world
who
will
understand
you
who
will
love
you
who
will
see
the
treasures
hidden
in
that
frail
body
no
one
like
me
you
are
alone
on
she
sighed
and
wept
the
graceful
pose
of
her
child
lying
on
her
knees
made
her
smile
sadly
she
looked
at
him
long
tasting
one
of
those
pleasures
which
are
a
secret
between
mothers
and
god
etienne
s
weakness
was
so
great
that
until
he
was
a
year
and
a
half
old
she
had
never
dared
to
take
him
out
of
doors
but
now
the
faint
color
which
tinted
the
whiteness
of
his
skin
like
the
petals
of
a
wild
rose
showed
that
life
and
health
were
already
there
one
morning
the
countess
giving
herself
up
to
the
glad
joy
of
all
mothers
when
their
first
child
walks
for
the
first
time
was
playing
with
etienne
on
the
floor
when
suddenly
she
heard
the
heavy
step
of
a
man
upon
the
boards
hardly
had
she
risen
with
a
movement
of
involuntary
surprise
when
the
count
stood
before
her
she
gave
a
cry
but
endeavored
instantly
to
undo
that
involuntary
wrong
by
going
up
to
him
and
offering
her
forehead
for
a
kiss
why
not
have
sent
me
notice
of
your
return
she
said
my
reception
would
have
been
more
cordial
but
less
frank
he
answered
bitterly
suddenly
he
saw
the
child
the
evident
health
in
which
he
found
it
wrung
from
him
a
gesture
of
surprise
mingled
with
fury
but
he
repressed
his
anger
and
began
to
smile
i
bring
good
news
he
said
i
have
received
the
governorship
of
champagne
and
the
king
s
promise
to
be
made
duke
and
peer
moreover
we
have
inherited
a
princely
fortune
from
your
cousin
that
cursed
huguenot
georges
de
chaverny
is
the
countess
turned
pale
and
dropped
into
a
chair
she
saw
the
secret
of
the
devilish
smile
on
her
husband
s
face
monsieur
she
said
in
a
voice
of
emotion
you
know
well
that
i
loved
my
cousin
chaverny
you
will
answer
to
god
for
the
pain
you
inflict
upon
at
these
words
the
eye
of
the
count
glittered
his
lips
trembled
but
he
could
not
utter
a
word
so
furious
was
he
he
flung
his
dagger
on
the
table
with
such
violence
that
the
metal
resounded
like
a
listen
to
me
he
said
in
his
strongest
voice
and
remember
my
words
i
will
never
see
or
hear
the
little
monster
you
hold
in
your
arms
he
is
your
child
and
not
mine
there
is
nothing
of
me
in
him
hide
him
i
say
hide
him
from
my
sight
or
just
god
cried
the
countess
protect
us
silence
said
her
husband
if
you
do
not
wish
me
to
throttle
him
see
that
i
never
find
him
in
my
then
said
the
countess
gathering
strength
to
oppose
her
tyrant
swear
to
me
that
if
you
never
meet
him
you
will
do
nothing
to
injure
him
can
i
trust
your
word
as
a
nobleman
for
that
what
does
all
this
mean
said
the
count
if
you
will
not
swear
kill
us
now
together
cried
the
countess
falling
on
her
knees
and
pressing
her
child
to
her
breast
rise
madame
i
give
you
my
word
as
a
man
of
honor
to
do
nothing
against
the
life
of
that
cursed
child
provided
he
lives
among
the
rocks
between
the
sea
and
the
house
and
never
crosses
my
path
i
will
give
him
that
fisherman
s
house
down
there
for
his
dwelling
and
the
beach
for
a
domain
but
woe
betide
him
if
i
ever
find
him
beyond
those
the
countess
began
to
weep
look
at
him
she
said
he
is
your
madame
at
that
word
the
frightened
mother
carried
away
the
child
whose
heart
was
beating
like
that
of
a
bird
caught
in
its
nest
whether
innocence
has
a
power
which
the
hardest
men
can
not
escape
or
whether
the
count
regretted
his
violence
and
feared
to
plunge
into
despair
a
creature
so
necessary
to
his
pleasures
and
also
to
his
worldly
prosperity
it
is
certain
that
his
voice
was
as
soft
as
it
was
possible
to
make
it
when
his
wife
returned
jeanne
my
dear
he
said
do
not
be
angry
with
me
give
me
your
hand
one
never
knows
how
to
trust
you
women
i
return
bringing
you
fresh
honors
and
more
wealth
and
yet
you
receive
me
like
an
enemy
my
new
government
will
oblige
me
to
make
long
absences
until
i
can
exchange
it
for
that
of
lower
normandy
and
i
request
my
dear
that
you
will
show
me
a
pleasant
face
while
i
am
the
countess
understood
the
meaning
of
the
words
the
feigned
softness
of
which
could
no
longer
deceive
her
i
know
my
duty
she
replied
in
a
tone
of
sadness
which
the
count
mistook
for
tenderness
the
timid
creature
had
too
much
purity
and
dignity
to
try
as
some
clever
women
would
have
done
to
govern
the
count
by
putting
calculation
into
her
conduct
a
sort
of
prostitution
by
which
noble
souls
feel
degraded
silently
she
turned
away
to
console
her
despair
with
etienne
shall
i
never
be
loved
cried
the
count
seeing
the
tears
in
his
wife
s
eyes
as
she
left
the
room
thus
incessantly
threatened
motherhood
became
to
the
poor
woman
a
passion
which
assumed
the
intensity
that
women
put
into
their
guilty
affections
by
a
species
of
occult
communion
the
secret
of
which
is
in
the
hearts
of
mothers
the
child
comprehended
the
peril
that
threatened
him
and
dreaded
the
approach
of
his
father
the
terrible
scene
of
which
he
had
been
a
witness
remained
in
his
memory
and
affected
him
like
an
illness
at
the
sound
of
the
count
s
step
his
features
contracted
and
the
mother
s
ear
was
not
so
alert
as
the
instinct
of
her
child
as
he
grew
older
this
faculty
created
by
terror
increased
until
like
the
savages
of
america
etienne
could
distinguish
his
father
s
step
and
hear
his
voice
at
immense
distances
to
witness
the
terror
with
which
the
count
inspired
her
thus
shared
by
her
child
made
etienne
the
more
precious
to
the
countess
their
union
was
so
strengthened
that
like
two
flowers
on
one
twig
they
bent
to
the
same
wind
and
lifted
their
heads
with
the
same
hope
in
short
they
were
one
life
when
the
count
again
left
home
jeanne
was
pregnant
this
time
she
gave
birth
in
due
season
and
not
without
great
suffering
to
a
stout
boy
who
soon
became
the
living
image
of
his
father
so
that
the
hatred
of
the
count
for
his
was
increased
by
this
event
to
save
her
cherished
child
the
countess
agreed
to
all
the
plans
which
her
husband
formed
for
the
happiness
and
wealth
of
his
second
son
whom
he
named
maximilien
etienne
was
to
be
made
a
priest
in
order
to
leave
the
property
and
titles
of
the
house
of
herouville
to
his
younger
brother
at
that
cost
the
poor
mother
believed
she
ensured
the
safety
of
her
hated
child
no
two
brothers
were
ever
more
unlike
than
etienne
and
maximilien
the
younger
s
taste
was
all
for
noise
violent
exercises
and
war
and
the
count
felt
for
him
the
same
excessive
love
that
his
wife
felt
for
etienne
by
a
tacit
compact
each
parent
took
charge
of
the
child
of
their
heart
the
duke
for
about
this
time
henri
iv
rewarded
the
services
of
the
seigneur
d
herouville
with
a
dukedom
not
wishing
he
said
to
fatigue
his
wife
gave
the
nursing
of
the
youngest
boy
to
a
stout
chosen
by
beauvouloir
and
announced
his
determination
to
bring
up
the
child
in
his
own
manner
he
gave
him
as
time
went
on
a
holy
horror
of
books
and
study
taught
him
the
mechanical
knowledge
required
by
a
military
career
made
him
a
good
rider
a
good
shot
with
an
arquebuse
and
skilful
with
his
dagger
when
the
boy
was
big
enough
he
took
him
to
hunt
and
let
him
acquire
the
savage
language
the
rough
manners
the
bodily
strength
and
the
vivacity
of
look
and
speech
which
to
his
mind
were
the
attributes
of
an
accomplished
man
the
boy
became
by
the
time
he
was
twelve
years
old
a
as
formidable
in
his
way
as
the
father
himself
having
free
rein
to
tyrannize
over
every
one
and
using
the
privilege
etienne
lived
in
the
little
house
or
lodge
near
the
sea
given
to
him
by
his
father
and
fitted
up
by
the
duchess
with
some
of
the
comforts
and
enjoyments
to
which
he
had
a
right
she
herself
spent
the
greater
part
of
her
time
there
together
the
mother
and
child
roamed
over
the
rocks
and
the
shore
keeping
strictly
within
the
limits
of
the
boy
s
domain
of
beach
and
shells
of
moss
and
pebbles
the
boy
s
terror
of
his
father
was
so
great
that
like
the
lapp
who
lives
and
dies
in
his
snow
he
made
a
native
land
of
his
rocks
and
his
cottage
and
was
terrified
and
uneasy
if
he
passed
his
frontier
the
duchess
knowing
her
child
was
not
fitted
to
find
happiness
except
in
some
humble
and
retired
sphere
did
not
regret
the
fate
that
was
thus
imposed
upon
him
she
used
this
enforced
vocation
to
prepare
him
for
a
noble
life
of
study
and
science
and
she
brought
to
the
chateau
pierre
de
sebonde
as
tutor
to
the
future
priest
nevertheless
in
spite
of
the
tonsure
imposed
by
the
will
of
the
father
she
was
determined
that
etienne
s
education
should
not
be
wholly
ecclesiastical
and
took
pains
to
secularize
it
she
employed
beauvouloir
to
teach
him
the
mysteries
of
natural
science
she
herself
superintended
his
studies
regulating
them
according
to
her
child
s
strength
and
enlivening
them
by
teaching
him
italian
and
revealing
to
him
little
by
little
the
poetic
beauties
of
that
language
while
the
duke
rode
off
with
maximilien
to
the
forest
and
the
at
the
risk
of
his
life
jeanne
wandered
with
etienne
in
the
milky
way
of
petrarch
s
sonnets
or
the
mighty
labyrinth
of
the
divina
comedia
nature
had
endowed
the
youth
in
compensation
for
his
infirmities
with
so
melodious
a
voice
that
to
hear
him
sing
was
a
constant
delight
his
mother
taught
him
music
and
their
tender
melancholy
songs
accompanied
by
a
mandolin
were
the
favorite
recreation
promised
as
a
reward
for
some
more
arduous
study
required
by
the
abbe
de
sebonde
etienne
listened
to
his
mother
with
a
passionate
admiration
she
had
never
seen
except
in
the
eyes
of
georges
de
chaverny
the
first
time
the
poor
woman
found
a
memory
of
her
girlhood
in
the
long
slow
look
of
her
child
she
covered
him
with
kisses
and
she
blushed
when
etienne
asked
her
why
she
seemed
to
love
him
better
at
that
moment
than
ever
before
she
answered
that
every
hour
made
him
dearer
to
her
she
found
in
the
training
of
his
soul
and
in
the
culture
of
his
mind
pleasures
akin
to
those
she
had
tasted
in
feeding
him
with
her
milk
she
put
all
her
pride
and
into
making
him
superior
to
herself
and
not
in
ruling
him
hearts
without
tenderness
covet
dominion
but
a
true
love
treasures
abnegation
that
virtue
of
strength
when
etienne
could
not
at
first
comprehend
a
demonstration
a
theme
a
theory
the
poor
mother
who
was
present
at
the
lessons
seemed
to
long
to
infuse
knowledge
as
formerly
she
had
given
nourishment
at
the
child
s
least
cry
and
then
what
joy
suffused
her
eyes
when
etienne
s
mind
seized
the
true
sense
of
things
and
appropriated
it
she
proved
as
pierre
de
sebonde
said
that
a
mother
is
a
dual
being
whose
sensations
cover
two
existences
ah
if
some
woman
as
loving
as
i
could
infuse
into
him
hereafter
the
life
of
love
how
happy
he
might
be
she
often
thought
but
the
fatal
interests
which
consigned
etienne
to
the
priesthood
returned
to
her
mind
and
she
kissed
the
hair
that
the
scissors
of
the
church
were
to
shear
leaving
her
tears
upon
them
still
in
spite
of
the
unjust
compact
she
had
made
with
the
duke
she
could
not
see
etienne
in
her
visions
of
the
future
as
priest
or
cardinal
and
the
absolute
forgetfulness
of
the
father
as
to
his
enabled
her
to
postpone
the
moment
of
putting
him
into
holy
orders
there
is
time
enough
she
said
to
herself
the
day
came
when
all
her
cares
inspired
by
a
sentiment
which
seemed
to
enter
into
the
flesh
of
her
son
and
give
it
life
had
their
reward
beauvouloir
that
blessed
man
whose
teachings
had
proved
so
precious
to
the
child
and
whose
anxious
glance
at
that
frail
idol
had
so
often
made
the
duchess
tremble
declared
that
etienne
was
now
in
a
condition
to
live
long
years
provided
no
violent
emotion
came
to
convulse
his
delicate
body
etienne
was
then
sixteen
at
that
age
he
was
just
five
feet
a
height
he
never
passed
his
skin
as
transparent
and
satiny
as
that
of
a
little
girl
showed
a
delicate
tracery
of
blue
veins
its
whiteness
was
that
of
porcelain
his
eyes
which
were
light
blue
and
ineffably
gentle
implored
the
protection
of
men
and
women
that
beseeching
look
fascinated
before
the
melody
of
his
voice
was
heard
to
complete
the
charm
true
modesty
was
in
every
feature
long
chestnut
hair
smooth
and
very
fine
was
parted
in
the
middle
of
his
head
into
two
bandeaus
which
curled
at
their
extremity
his
pale
and
hollow
cheeks
his
pure
brow
lined
with
a
few
furrows
expressed
a
condition
of
suffering
which
was
painful
to
witness
his
mouth
always
gracious
and
adorned
with
very
white
teeth
wore
the
sort
of
fixed
smile
which
we
often
see
on
the
lips
of
the
dying
his
hands
white
as
those
of
a
woman
were
remarkably
handsome
the
habit
of
meditation
had
taught
him
to
droop
his
head
like
a
fragile
flower
and
the
attitude
was
in
keeping
with
his
person
it
was
like
the
last
grace
that
a
great
artist
touches
into
a
portrait
to
bring
out
its
latent
thought
etienne
s
head
was
that
of
a
delicate
girl
placed
upon
the
weakly
and
deformed
body
of
a
man
poesy
the
rich
meditations
of
which
make
us
roam
like
botanists
through
the
vast
fields
of
thought
the
fruitful
comparison
of
human
ideas
the
enthusiasm
given
by
a
clear
conception
of
works
of
genius
came
to
be
the
inexhaustible
and
tranquil
joys
of
the
young
man
s
solitary
and
dreamy
life
flowers
ravishing
creatures
whose
destiny
resembled
his
own
were
his
loves
happy
to
see
in
her
son
the
innocent
passions
which
took
the
place
of
the
rough
contact
with
social
life
which
he
never
could
have
borne
the
duchess
encouraged
etienne
s
tastes
she
brought
him
spanish
romanceros
italian
motets
books
sonnets
poems
the
library
of
cardinal
d
herouville
came
into
etienne
s
possession
the
use
of
which
filled
his
life
these
readings
which
his
fragile
health
forbade
him
to
continue
for
many
hours
at
a
time
and
his
rambles
among
the
rocks
of
his
domain
were
interspersed
with
naive
meditations
which
kept
him
motionless
for
hours
together
before
his
smiling
flowers
those
sweet
companions
or
crouching
in
a
niche
of
the
rocks
before
some
species
of
algae
a
moss
a
seaweed
studying
their
mysteries
seeking
perhaps
a
rhythm
in
their
fragrant
depths
like
a
bee
its
honey
he
often
admired
without
purpose
and
without
explaining
his
pleasure
to
himself
the
slender
lines
on
the
petals
of
dark
flowers
the
delicacy
of
their
rich
tunics
of
gold
or
purple
green
or
azure
the
fringes
so
profusely
beautiful
of
their
calyxes
or
leaves
their
ivory
or
velvet
textures
later
a
thinker
as
well
as
a
poet
he
would
detect
the
reason
of
these
innumerable
differences
in
a
single
nature
by
discovering
the
indication
of
unknown
faculties
for
from
day
to
day
he
made
progress
in
the
interpretation
of
the
divine
word
writing
upon
all
things
here
below
these
constant
and
secret
researches
into
matters
occult
gave
to
etienne
s
life
the
apparent
somnolence
of
meditative
genius
he
would
spend
long
days
lying
upon
the
shore
happy
a
poet
of
the
fact
the
sudden
irruption
of
a
gilded
insect
the
shimmering
of
the
sun
upon
the
ocean
the
tremulous
motion
of
the
vast
and
limpid
mirror
of
the
waters
a
shell
a
crab
all
was
event
and
pleasure
to
that
ingenuous
young
soul
and
then
to
see
his
mother
coming
towards
him
to
hear
from
afar
the
rustle
of
her
gown
to
await
her
to
kiss
her
to
talk
to
her
to
listen
to
her
gave
him
such
keen
emotions
that
often
a
slight
delay
a
trifling
fear
would
throw
him
into
a
violent
fever
in
him
there
was
nought
but
soul
and
in
order
that
the
weak
debilitated
body
should
not
be
destroyed
by
the
keen
emotions
of
that
soul
etienne
needed
silence
caresses
peace
in
the
landscape
and
the
love
of
a
woman
for
the
time
being
his
mother
gave
him
the
love
and
the
caresses
flowers
and
books
entranced
his
solitude
his
little
kingdom
of
sand
and
shells
algae
and
verdure
seemed
to
him
a
universe
ever
fresh
and
new
etienne
imbibed
all
the
benefits
of
this
physical
and
absolutely
innocent
life
this
mental
and
moral
life
so
poetically
extended
a
child
by
form
a
man
in
mind
he
was
equally
angelic
under
either
aspect
by
his
mother
s
influence
his
studies
had
removed
his
emotions
to
the
region
of
ideas
the
action
of
his
life
took
place
therefore
in
the
moral
world
far
from
the
social
world
which
would
either
have
killed
him
or
made
him
suffer
he
lived
by
his
soul
and
by
his
intellect
laying
hold
of
human
thought
by
reading
he
rose
to
thoughts
that
stirred
in
matter
he
felt
the
thoughts
of
the
air
he
read
the
thoughts
on
the
skies
early
he
mounted
that
ethereal
summit
where
alone
he
found
the
delicate
nourishment
that
his
soul
needed
intoxicating
food
which
predestined
him
to
sorrow
whenever
to
these
accumulated
treasures
should
be
added
the
riches
of
a
passion
rising
suddenly
in
his
heart
if
at
times
jeanne
de
dreaded
that
coming
storm
he
consoled
herself
with
a
thought
which
the
otherwise
sad
vocation
of
her
son
put
into
her
mind
for
the
poor
mother
found
no
remedy
for
his
sorrows
except
some
lesser
sorrow
he
will
be
a
cardinal
she
thought
he
will
live
in
the
sentiment
of
art
of
which
he
will
make
himself
the
protector
he
will
love
art
instead
of
loving
a
woman
and
art
will
not
betray
the
pleasures
of
this
tender
motherhood
were
incessantly
held
in
check
by
sad
reflections
born
of
the
strange
position
in
which
etienne
was
placed
the
brothers
had
passed
the
adolescent
age
without
knowing
each
other
without
so
much
as
even
suspecting
their
rival
existence
the
duchess
had
long
hoped
for
an
opportunity
during
the
absence
of
her
husband
to
bind
the
two
brothers
to
each
other
in
some
solemn
scene
by
which
she
might
enfold
them
both
in
her
love
this
hope
long
cherished
had
now
faded
far
from
wishing
to
bring
about
an
intercourse
between
the
brothers
she
feared
an
encounter
between
them
even
more
than
between
the
father
and
son
maximilien
who
believed
in
evil
only
might
have
feared
that
etienne
would
some
day
claim
his
rights
and
so
fearing
might
have
flung
him
into
the
sea
with
a
stone
around
his
neck
no
son
had
ever
less
respect
for
a
mother
than
he
as
soon
as
he
could
reason
he
had
seen
the
low
esteem
in
which
the
duke
held
his
wife
if
the
old
man
still
retained
some
forms
of
decency
in
his
manners
to
the
duchess
maximilien
unrestrained
by
his
father
caused
his
mother
many
a
grief
consequently
bertrand
was
incessantly
on
the
watch
to
prevent
maximilien
from
seeing
etienne
whose
existence
was
carefully
concealed
all
the
attendants
of
the
castle
cordially
hated
the
marquis
de
the
name
and
title
borne
by
the
younger
brother
and
those
who
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
elder
looked
upon
him
as
an
avenger
whom
god
was
holding
in
reserve
etienne
s
future
was
therefore
doubtful
he
might
even
be
persecuted
by
his
own
brother
the
poor
duchess
had
no
relations
to
whom
she
could
confide
the
life
and
interests
of
her
cherished
child
would
he
not
blame
her
when
in
his
violet
robes
he
longed
to
be
a
father
as
she
had
been
a
mother
these
thoughts
and
her
melancholy
life
so
full
of
secret
sorrows
were
like
a
mortal
illness
kept
at
bay
for
a
time
by
remedies
her
heart
needed
the
wisest
management
and
those
about
her
were
cruelly
inexpert
in
gentleness
what
mother
s
heart
would
not
have
been
torn
at
the
sight
of
her
eldest
son
a
man
of
mind
and
soul
in
whom
a
noble
genius
made
itself
felt
deprived
of
his
rights
while
the
younger
hard
and
brutal
without
talent
even
military
talent
was
chosen
to
wear
the
ducal
coronet
and
perpetuate
the
family
the
house
of
herouville
was
discarding
its
own
glory
incapable
of
anger
the
gentle
jeanne
de
could
only
bless
and
weep
but
often
she
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
asking
it
to
account
for
this
singular
doom
those
eyes
filled
with
tears
when
she
thought
that
at
her
death
her
cherished
child
would
be
wholly
orphaned
and
left
exposed
to
the
brutalities
of
a
brother
without
faith
or
conscience
such
emotions
repressed
a
first
love
unforgotten
so
many
sorrows
ignored
and
hidden
within
her
for
she
kept
her
keenest
sufferings
from
her
cherished
child
her
joys
embittered
her
griefs
unrelieved
all
these
shocks
had
weakened
the
springs
of
life
and
were
developing
in
her
system
a
slow
consumption
which
day
by
day
was
gathering
greater
force
a
last
blow
hastened
it
she
tried
to
warn
the
duke
as
to
the
results
of
maximilien
s
education
and
was
repulsed
she
saw
that
she
could
give
no
remedy
to
the
shocking
seeds
which
were
germinating
in
the
soul
of
her
second
child
from
this
moment
began
a
period
of
decline
which
soon
became
so
visible
as
to
bring
about
the
appointment
of
beauvouloir
to
the
post
of
physician
to
the
house
of
herouville
and
the
government
of
normandy
the
former
bonesetter
came
to
live
at
the
castle
in
those
days
such
posts
belonged
to
learned
men
who
thus
gained
a
living
and
the
leisure
necessary
for
a
studious
life
and
the
accomplishment
of
scientific
work
beauvouloir
had
for
some
time
desired
the
situation
because
his
knowledge
and
his
fortune
had
won
him
numerous
bitter
enemies
in
spite
of
the
protection
of
a
great
family
to
whom
he
had
done
great
services
he
had
recently
been
implicated
in
a
criminal
case
and
the
intervention
of
the
governor
of
normandy
obtained
by
the
duchess
had
alone
saved
him
from
being
brought
to
trial
the
duke
had
no
reason
to
repent
this
protection
given
to
the
old
bonesetter
beauvouloir
saved
the
life
of
the
marquis
de
in
so
dangerous
an
illness
that
any
other
physician
would
have
failed
in
doing
so
but
the
wounds
of
the
duchess
were
too
and
dated
too
far
back
to
be
cured
especially
as
they
were
constantly
kept
open
in
her
home
when
her
sufferings
warned
this
angel
of
many
sorrows
that
her
end
was
approaching
death
was
hastened
by
the
gloomy
apprehensions
that
filled
her
mind
as
to
the
future
what
will
become
of
my
poor
child
without
me
was
a
thought
renewed
every
hour
like
a
bitter
tide
obliged
at
last
to
keep
her
bed
the
duchess
failed
rapidly
for
she
was
then
unable
to
see
her
son
forbidden
as
he
was
by
her
compact
with
his
father
to
approach
the
house
the
sorrow
of
the
youth
was
equal
to
that
of
the
mother
inspired
by
the
genius
of
repressed
feeling
etienne
created
a
mystical
language
by
which
to
communicate
with
his
mother
he
studied
the
resources
of
his
voice
like
an
and
often
he
came
beneath
her
windows
to
let
her
hear
his
melodiously
melancholy
voice
when
beauvouloir
by
a
sign
informed
him
she
was
alone
formerly
as
a
babe
he
had
consoled
his
mother
with
his
smiles
now
become
a
poet
he
caressed
her
with
his
melodies
those
songs
give
me
life
said
the
duchess
to
beauvouloir
inhaling
the
air
that
etienne
s
voice
made
living
at
length
the
day
came
when
the
poor
son
s
mourning
began
already
he
had
felt
the
mysterious
correspondences
between
his
emotions
and
the
movements
of
the
ocean
the
divining
of
the
thoughts
of
matter
a
power
with
which
his
occult
knowledge
had
invested
him
made
this
phenomenon
more
eloquent
to
him
than
to
all
others
during
the
fatal
night
when
he
was
taken
to
see
his
mother
for
the
last
time
the
ocean
was
agitated
by
movements
that
to
him
were
full
of
meaning
the
heaving
waters
seemed
to
show
that
the
sea
was
working
intestinally
the
swelling
waves
rolled
in
and
spent
themselves
with
lugubrious
noises
like
the
howling
of
a
dog
in
distress
unconsciously
etienne
found
himself
saying
what
does
it
want
of
me
it
quivers
and
moans
like
a
living
creature
my
mother
has
often
told
me
that
the
ocean
was
in
horrible
convulsions
on
the
night
when
i
was
born
something
is
about
to
happen
to
this
thought
kept
him
standing
before
his
window
with
his
eyes
sometimes
on
his
mother
s
windows
where
a
faint
light
trembled
sometimes
on
the
ocean
which
continued
to
moan
suddenly
beauvouloir
knocked
on
the
door
of
his
room
opened
it
and
showed
on
his
saddened
face
the
reflection
of
some
new
misfortune
monseigneur
he
said
madame
la
duchesse
is
in
so
sad
a
state
that
she
wishes
to
see
you
all
precautions
are
taken
that
no
harm
shall
happen
to
you
in
the
castle
but
we
must
be
prudent
to
see
her
you
will
have
to
pass
through
the
room
of
monseigneur
the
duke
the
room
where
you
were
these
words
brought
the
tears
to
etienne
s
eyes
and
he
said
the
ocean
speak
to
me
mechanically
he
allowed
himself
to
be
led
towards
the
door
of
the
tower
which
gave
entrance
to
the
private
way
leading
to
the
duchess
s
room
bertrand
was
awaiting
him
lantern
in
hand
etienne
reached
the
library
of
the
cardinal
d
herouville
and
there
he
was
made
to
wait
with
beauvouloir
while
bertrand
went
on
to
unlock
the
other
doors
and
make
sure
that
the
hated
son
could
pass
through
his
father
s
house
without
danger
the
duke
did
not
awake
advancing
with
light
steps
etienne
and
beauvouloir
heard
in
that
immense
chateau
no
sound
but
the
plaintive
groans
of
the
dying
woman
thus
the
very
circumstances
attending
the
birth
of
etienne
were
renewed
at
the
death
of
his
mother
the
same
tempest
same
agony
same
dread
of
awaking
the
pitiless
giant
who
on
this
occasion
at
least
slept
soundly
bertrand
as
a
further
precaution
took
etienne
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
through
the
duke
s
room
intending
to
give
some
excuse
as
to
the
state
of
the
duchess
if
the
duke
awoke
and
detected
him
etienne
s
heart
was
horribly
wrung
by
the
same
fears
which
filled
the
minds
of
these
faithful
servants
but
this
emotion
prepared
him
in
a
measure
for
the
sight
that
met
his
eyes
in
that
signorial
room
which
he
had
never
since
the
fatal
day
when
as
a
child
the
paternal
curse
had
driven
him
from
it
on
the
great
bed
where
happiness
never
came
he
looked
for
his
beloved
and
scarcely
found
her
so
emaciated
was
she
white
as
her
own
laces
with
scarcely
a
breath
left
she
gathered
up
all
her
strength
to
clasp
etienne
s
hand
and
to
give
him
her
whole
soul
as
heretofore
in
a
look
chaverny
had
bequeathed
to
her
all
his
life
in
a
last
farewell
beauvouloir
and
bertrand
the
mother
and
the
sleeping
duke
were
all
once
more
assembled
same
place
same
scene
same
actors
but
this
was
funereal
grief
in
place
of
the
joys
of
motherhood
the
night
of
death
instead
of
the
dawn
of
life
at
that
moment
the
storm
threatened
by
the
melancholy
moaning
of
the
sea
since
sundown
suddenly
burst
forth
dear
flower
of
my
life
said
the
mother
kissing
her
son
you
were
taken
from
my
bosom
in
the
midst
of
a
tempest
and
in
a
tempest
i
am
taken
from
you
between
these
storms
all
life
has
been
stormy
to
me
except
the
hours
i
have
spent
with
you
this
is
my
last
joy
mingled
with
my
last
pangs
adieu
my
only
love
adieu
dear
image
of
two
souls
that
will
soon
be
reunited
adieu
my
only
joy
pure
joy
adieu
my
own
beloved
let
me
follow
thee
cried
etienne
it
would
be
your
better
fate
she
said
two
tears
rolling
down
her
livid
cheeks
for
as
in
former
days
her
eyes
seemed
to
read
the
future
did
any
one
see
him
she
asked
of
the
two
men
at
this
instant
the
duke
turned
in
his
bed
they
all
trembled
even
my
last
joy
is
mingled
with
pain
murmured
the
duchess
take
him
away
take
him
away
mother
i
would
rather
see
you
a
moment
longer
and
die
said
the
poor
lad
as
he
fainted
by
her
side
at
a
sign
from
the
duchess
bertrand
took
etienne
in
his
arms
and
showing
him
for
the
last
time
to
his
mother
who
kissed
him
with
a
last
look
he
turned
to
carry
him
away
awaiting
the
final
order
of
the
dying
mother
love
him
well
she
said
to
the
physician
and
bertrand
he
has
no
protectors
but
you
and
prompted
by
an
instinct
which
never
misleads
a
mother
she
had
felt
the
pity
of
the
old
retainer
for
the
eldest
son
of
a
house
for
which
his
veneration
was
only
comparable
to
that
of
the
jews
for
their
holy
city
jerusalem
as
for
beauvouloir
the
compact
between
himself
and
the
duchess
had
long
been
signed
the
two
servitors
deeply
moved
to
see
their
mistress
forced
to
bequeath
her
noble
child
to
none
but
themselves
promised
by
a
solemn
gesture
to
be
the
providence
of
their
young
master
and
the
mother
had
faith
in
that
gesture
the
duchess
died
towards
morning
mourned
by
the
servants
of
the
household
who
for
all
comment
were
heard
to
say
beside
her
grave
she
was
a
comely
woman
sent
from
etienne
s
sorrow
was
the
most
intense
the
most
lasting
of
sorrows
and
wholly
silent
he
wandered
no
more
among
his
rocks
he
felt
no
strength
to
read
or
sing
he
spent
whole
days
crouched
in
the
crevice
of
a
rock
caring
nought
for
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
motionless
fastened
to
the
granite
like
the
lichen
that
grew
upon
it
weeping
seldom
lost
in
one
sole
thought
immense
infinite
as
the
ocean
and
like
that
ocean
taking
a
thousand
forms
terrible
tempestuous
tender
calm
it
was
more
than
sorrow
it
was
a
new
existence
an
irrevocable
destiny
dooming
this
innocent
creature
to
smile
no
more
there
are
pangs
which
like
a
drop
of
blood
cast
into
flowing
water
stain
the
whole
current
instantly
the
stream
renewed
from
its
source
restores
the
purity
of
its
surface
but
with
etienne
the
source
itself
was
polluted
and
each
new
current
brought
its
own
gall
bertrand
in
his
old
age
had
retained
the
superintendence
of
the
stables
so
as
not
to
lose
the
habit
of
authority
in
the
household
his
house
was
not
far
from
that
of
etienne
so
that
he
was
ever
at
hand
to
watch
over
the
youth
with
the
persistent
affection
and
simple
wiliness
characteristic
of
old
soldiers
he
checked
his
roughness
when
speaking
to
the
poor
lad
softly
he
walked
in
rainy
weather
to
fetch
him
from
his
reverie
in
his
crevice
to
the
house
he
put
his
pride
into
filling
the
mother
s
place
so
that
her
child
might
find
if
not
her
love
at
least
the
same
attentions
this
pity
resembled
tenderness
etienne
bore
without
complaint
or
resistance
these
attentions
of
the
old
retainer
but
too
many
links
were
now
broken
between
the
hated
child
and
other
creatures
to
admit
of
any
keen
affection
at
present
in
his
heart
mechanically
he
allowed
himself
to
be
protected
he
became
as
it
were
an
intermediary
creature
between
man
and
plant
or
perhaps
one
might
say
between
man
and
god
to
what
shall
we
compare
a
being
to
whom
all
social
laws
all
the
false
sentiments
of
the
world
were
unknown
and
who
kept
his
ravishing
innocence
by
obeying
nought
but
the
instincts
of
his
heart
nevertheless
in
spite
of
his
sombre
melancholy
he
came
to
feel
the
need
of
loving
of
finding
another
mother
another
soul
for
his
soul
but
separated
from
civilization
by
an
iron
wall
it
was
impossible
to
meet
with
a
being
who
had
flowered
like
himself
instinctively
seeking
another
self
to
whom
to
confide
his
thoughts
and
whose
life
might
blend
with
his
life
he
ended
in
sympathizing
with
his
ocean
the
sea
became
to
him
a
living
thinking
being
always
in
presence
of
that
vast
creation
the
hidden
marvels
of
which
contrast
so
grandly
with
those
of
earth
he
discovered
the
meaning
of
many
mysteries
familiar
from
his
cradle
with
the
infinitude
of
those
liquid
fields
the
sea
and
the
sky
taught
him
many
poems
to
him
all
was
variety
in
that
vast
picture
so
monotonous
to
some
like
other
men
whose
souls
dominate
their
bodies
he
had
a
piercing
sight
which
could
reach
to
enormous
distances
and
seize
with
admirable
ease
and
without
fatigue
the
fleeting
tints
of
the
clouds
the
passing
shimmer
of
the
waters
on
days
of
perfect
stillness
his
eyes
could
see
the
manifold
tints
of
the
ocean
which
to
him
like
the
face
of
a
woman
had
its
physiognomy
its
smiles
ideas
caprices
there
green
and
sombre
here
smiling
and
azure
sometimes
uniting
its
brilliant
lines
with
the
hazy
gleams
of
the
horizon
or
again
softly
swaying
beneath
the
heavens
for
him
fetes
were
celebrated
at
sundown
when
the
star
of
day
poured
its
red
colors
on
the
waves
in
a
crimson
flood
for
him
the
sea
was
gay
and
sparkling
and
spirited
when
it
quivered
in
repeating
the
noonday
light
from
a
thousand
dazzling
facets
to
him
it
revealed
its
wondrous
melancholy
it
made
him
weep
whenever
calm
or
sad
it
reflected
the
sky
surcharged
with
clouds
he
had
learned
the
mute
language
of
that
vast
creation
the
flux
and
reflux
of
its
waters
were
to
him
a
melodious
breathing
which
uttered
in
his
ear
a
sentiment
he
felt
and
comprehended
its
inward
meaning
no
mariner
no
man
of
science
could
have
predicted
better
than
he
the
slightest
wrath
of
the
ocean
the
faintest
change
on
that
vast
face
by
the
manner
of
the
waves
as
they
rose
and
died
away
upon
the
shore
he
could
foresee
tempests
surges
squalls
the
height
of
tides
or
calms
when
night
had
spread
its
veil
upon
the
sky
he
still
could
see
the
sea
in
its
twilight
mystery
and
talk
with
it
at
all
times
he
shared
its
fecund
life
feeling
in
his
soul
the
tempest
when
it
was
angry
breathing
its
rage
in
its
hissing
breath
running
with
its
waves
as
they
broke
in
a
thousand
liquid
fringes
upon
the
rocks
he
felt
himself
intrepid
free
and
terrible
as
the
sea
itself
like
it
he
bounded
and
fell
back
he
kept
its
solemn
silence
he
copied
its
sudden
pause
in
short
he
had
wedded
the
sea
it
was
now
his
confidant
his
friend
in
the
morning
when
he
crossed
the
glowing
sands
of
the
beach
and
came
upon
his
rocks
he
divined
the
temper
of
the
ocean
from
a
single
glance
he
could
see
landscapes
on
its
surface
he
hovered
above
the
face
of
the
waters
like
an
angel
coming
down
from
heaven
when
the
joyous
mischievous
white
mists
cast
their
gossamer
before
him
like
a
veil
before
the
face
of
a
bride
he
followed
their
undulations
and
caprices
with
the
joy
of
a
lover
his
thought
married
with
that
grand
expression
of
the
divine
thought
consoled
him
in
his
solitude
and
the
thousand
outlooks
of
his
soul
peopled
its
desert
with
glorious
fantasies
he
ended
at
last
by
divining
in
the
motions
of
the
sea
its
close
communion
with
the
celestial
system
he
perceived
nature
in
its
harmonious
whole
from
the
blade
of
grass
to
the
wandering
stars
which
seek
like
seeds
driven
by
the
wind
to
plant
themselves
in
ether
pure
as
an
angel
virgin
of
those
ideas
which
degrade
mankind
naive
as
a
child
he
lived
like
a
a
gull
or
a
flower
prodigal
of
the
treasures
of
poetic
imagination
and
possessed
of
a
divine
knowledge
the
fruitful
extent
of
which
he
contemplated
in
solitude
incredible
mingling
of
two
creations
sometimes
he
rose
to
god
in
prayer
sometimes
he
descended
humble
and
resigned
to
the
quiet
happiness
of
animals
to
him
the
stars
were
the
flowers
of
night
the
birds
his
friends
the
sun
was
a
father
everywhere
he
found
the
soul
of
his
mother
often
he
saw
her
in
the
clouds
he
spoke
to
her
they
communicated
veritably
by
celestial
visions
on
certain
days
he
could
hear
her
voice
and
see
her
smile
in
short
there
were
days
when
he
had
not
lost
her
god
seemed
to
have
given
him
the
power
of
the
hermits
of
old
to
have
endowed
him
with
some
perfected
inner
senses
which
penetrated
to
the
spirit
of
all
things
unknown
moral
forces
enabled
him
to
go
farther
than
other
men
into
the
secrets
of
the
immortal
labor
his
yearnings
his
sorrows
were
the
links
that
united
him
to
the
unseen
world
he
went
there
armed
with
his
love
to
seek
his
mother
realizing
thus
with
the
sublime
harmonies
of
ecstasy
the
symbolic
enterprise
of
orpheus
often
when
crouching
in
the
crevice
of
some
rock
capriciously
curled
up
in
his
granite
grotto
the
entrance
to
which
was
as
narrow
as
that
of
a
charcoal
kiln
he
would
sink
into
involuntary
sleep
his
figure
softly
lighted
by
the
warm
rays
of
the
sun
which
crept
through
the
fissures
and
fell
upon
the
dainty
seaweeds
that
adorned
his
retreat
the
veritable
nest
of
a
the
sun
his
sovereign
lord
alone
told
him
that
he
had
slept
by
measuring
the
time
he
had
been
absent
from
his
watery
landscapes
his
golden
sands
his
shells
and
pebbles
across
a
light
as
brilliant
as
that
from
heaven
he
saw
the
cities
of
which
he
read
he
looked
with
amazement
but
without
envy
at
courts
and
kings
battles
men
and
buildings
these
daylight
dreams
made
dearer
to
him
his
precious
flowers
his
clouds
his
sun
his
granite
rocks
to
attach
him
the
more
to
his
solitary
existence
an
angel
seemed
to
reveal
to
him
the
abysses
of
the
moral
world
and
the
terrible
shocks
of
civilization
he
felt
that
his
soul
if
torn
by
the
throng
of
men
would
perish
like
a
pearl
dropped
from
the
crown
of
a
princess

mud

how
the
son
died
chapter
iv
the
heir
in
twenty
and
some
years
after
the
horrible
night
during
which
etienne
came
into
the
world
the
duc
d
herouville
then
years
old
broken
decrepit
almost
dead
was
sitting
at
sunset
in
an
immense
before
the
gothic
window
of
his
bedroom
at
the
place
where
his
wife
had
so
vainly
implored
by
the
sounds
of
the
horn
wasted
on
the
air
the
help
of
men
and
heaven
you
might
have
thought
him
a
body
resurrected
from
the
grave
his
once
energetic
face
stripped
of
its
sinister
aspect
by
old
age
and
suffering
was
ghastly
in
color
matching
the
long
meshes
of
white
hair
which
fell
around
his
bald
head
the
yellow
skull
of
which
seemed
softening
the
warrior
and
the
fanatic
still
shone
in
those
yellow
eyes
tempered
now
by
religious
sentiment
devotion
had
cast
a
monastic
tone
upon
the
face
formerly
so
hard
but
now
marked
with
tints
which
softened
its
expression
the
reflections
of
the
setting
sun
colored
with
a
faintly
ruddy
tinge
the
head
which
in
spite
of
all
infirmities
was
still
vigorous
the
feeble
body
wrapped
in
brown
garments
gave
by
its
heavy
attitude
and
the
absence
of
all
movement
a
vivid
impression
of
the
monotonous
existence
the
terrible
repose
of
this
man
once
so
active
so
enterprising
so
vindictive
enough
he
said
to
his
chaplain
that
venerable
old
man
was
reading
aloud
the
gospel
standing
before
the
master
in
a
respectful
attitude
the
duke
like
an
old
menagerie
lion
which
has
reached
a
decrepitude
that
is
still
full
of
majesty
turned
to
another

and
said
holding
out

fleshless
arm
covered
with
sparse
hairs
still
sinewy
but
without

bertrand

at
seeing
the

give
way
to
an
excitement

was
dangerous
to

convalescent
read
it
maitre
corbineau
said
the
old
man
holding
out
the
missive
to
his
confessor
these
four
personages
formed
a
tableau
full
of
instruction
upon
human
life
the
the
priest
and
the
physician
all
three
standing
before
their
master
who
was
seated
in
his
were
casting
pallid
glances
about
them
each
presenting
one
of
those
ideas
which
end
by
possessing
the
whole
man
on
the
verge
of
the
tomb
strongly
illumined
by
a
last
ray
of
the
setting
sun
these
silent
men
composed
a
picture
of
aged
melancholy
fertile
in
contrasts
the
sombre
and
solemn
chamber
where
nothing
had
been
changed
in
years
made
a
frame
for
this
poetic
canvas
full
of
extinguished
passions
saddened
by
death
tinctured
by
religion
the
marechal
d

has
been
killed
on
the
pont

by
order
of
the
king
and
o

go
on
cried
the
duke
monsieur
le
duc
de
nivron
well
is
dead
the
duke
dropped
his
head
upon
his
breast
with
a
great
sigh
but
was
silent
at
those
words
at
that
sigh
the
three
old
men
looked
at
each
other
it
seemed
to
them
as
though
the
illustrious
and
opulent
house
of
herouville
was
disappearing
before
their
eyes
like
a
sinking
ship
the
master
above
said
the
duke
casting
a
terrible
glance
at
the
heavens
is
ungrateful
to
me
he
forgets
the
great
deeds
i
have
performed
for
his
holy
god
has
avenged
himself
said
the
priest
in
a
solemn
voice
put
that
man
in
the
dungeon
cried
the
duke
you
can
silence
me
far
more
easily
than
you
can
your
the
duke
sank
back
in
thought
my
house
to
perish
my
name
to
be
extinct
i
will
marry
i
will
have
a
son
he
said
after
a
long
pause
though
the
expression
of
despair
on
the
duke
s
face
was
truly
awful
the
bonesetter
could
not
repress
a
smile
at
that
instant
a
song
fresh
as
the
evening
breeze
pure
as
the
sky
equable
as
the
color
of
the
ocean
rose
above
the
murmur
of
the
waves
to
cast
its
charm
over
nature
herself
the
melancholy
of
that
voice
the
melody
of
its
tones
shed
as
it
were
a
perfume
rising
to
the
soul
its
harmony
rose
like
a
vapor
filling
the
air
it
poured
a
balm
on
sorrows
or
rather
it
consoled
them
by
expressing
them
the
voice
mingled
with
the
gurgle
of
the
waves
so
perfectly
that
it
seemed
to
rise
from
the
bosom
of
the
waters
that
song
was
sweeter
to
the
ears
of
those
old
men
than
the
tenderest
word
of
love
on
the
lips
of
a
young
girl
it
brought
religious
hope
into
their
souls
like
a
voice
from
heaven
what
is
that
asked
the
duke
the
little
nightingale
is
singing
said
bertrand
all
is
not
lost
either
for
him
or
for
what
do
you
call
a
nightingale
that
is
the
name
we
have
given
to
monseigneur
s
eldest
son
replied
bertrand
my
son
cried
the
old
man
have
i
a
son
a
son
to
bear
my
name
and
to
perpetuate
it
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
with
steps
in
turn
precipitate
and
slow
then
he
made
an
imperious
gesture
sending
every
one
away
from
him
except
the
priest
the
next
morning
the
duke
leaning
on
the
arm
of
his
old
retainer
bertrand
walked
along
the
shore
and
among
the
rocks
looking
for
the
son
he
had
so
long
hated
he
saw
him
from
afar
in
a
recess
of
the
granite
rocks
lying
carelessly
extended
in
the
sun
his
head
on
a
tuft
of
mossy
grass
his
feet
gracefully
drawn
up
beneath
him
so
lying
etienne
was
like
a
swallow
at
rest
as
soon
as
the
tall
old
man
appeared
upon
the
beach
the
sound
of
his
steps
mingling
faintly
with
the
voice
of
the
waves
the
young
man
turned
his
head
gave
the
cry
of
a
startled
bird
and
disappeared
as
if
into
the
rock
itself
like
a
mouse
darting
so
quickly
into
its
hole
that
we
doubt
if
we
have
even
seen
it
hey
where
has
he
hid
himself
cried
the
duke
reaching
the
rock
beside
which
his
son
had
been
lying
he
is
there
replied
bertrand
pointing
to
a
narrow
crevice
the
edges
of
which
had
been
polished
smooth
by
the
repeated
assaults
of
the
high
tide
etienne
my
beloved
son
called
the
old
man
the
hated
child
made
no
reply
for
hours
the
duke
entreated
threatened
implored
in
turn
receiving
no
response
sometimes
he
was
silent
with
his
ear
at
the
cleft
of
the
rock
where
even
his
enfeebled
hearing
could
detect
the
beating
of
etienne
s
heart
the
quick
pulsations
of
which
echoed
from
the
sonorous
roof
of
his
rocky
at
least
lives
said
the
old
man
in
a
heartrending
voice
towards
the
middle
of
the
day
the
father
reduced
to
despair
had
recourse
to
prayer
etienne
he
said
my
dear
etienne
god
has
punished
me
for
disowning
you
he
has
deprived
me
of
your
brother
you
are
my
only
child
i
love
you
more
than
i
love
myself
i
see
the
wrong
i
have

your
veins

blood

of
your

misery

my
doing

to
make

cruelty

will
cherish

the
duc

and
you
will
be
after

the

of

of

of

golden

to
me
or
here
i
kneel
until
i
see
you
your
old
father
prays
you
he
humbles
himself
before
his
child
as
before
god
the
hated
son
paid
no
heed
to
this
language
bristling
with
social
ideas
and
vanities
he
did
not
comprehend
his
soul
remained
under
the
impressions
of
unconquerable
terror
he
was
silent
suffering
great
agony
towards
evening
the
old
seigneur
after
exhausting
all
formulas
of
language
all
resources
of
entreaty
all
repentant
promises
was
overcome
by
a
sort
of
religious
contrition
he
knelt
down
upon
the
sand
and
made
a
vow
i
swear
to
build
a
chapel
to
and
the
patrons
of
my
wife
and
son
and
to
found
one
hundred
masses
in
honor
of
the
virgin
if
god
and
the
saints
will
restore
to
me
the
affection
of
my
son
the
duc
de
nivron
here
he
remained
on
his
knees
in
deep
humility
with
clasped
hands
praying
finding
that
his
son
the
hope
of
his
name
still
did
not
come
to
him
great
tears
rose
in
his
eyes
dry
so
long
and
rolled
down
his
withered
cheeks
at
this
moment
etienne
hearing
no
further
sounds
glided
to
the
opening
of
his
grotto
like
a
young
adder
craving
the
sun
he
saw
the
tears
of
the
stricken
old
man
he
recognized
the
signs
of
a
true
grief
and
seizing
his
father
s
hand
he
kissed
him
saying
in
the
voice
of
an
angel
oh
mother
forgive
me
in
the
fever
of
his
happiness
the
old
duke
lifted
his
feeble
offspring
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
trembling
like
an
abducted
girl
toward
the
castle
as
he
felt
the
palpitation
of
his
son
s
body
he
strove
to
reassure
him
kissing
him
with
all
the
caution
he
might
have
shown
in
touching
a
delicate
flower
and
speaking
in
the
gentlest
tones
he
had
ever
in
his
life
used
in
order
to
soothe
him
god
s
truth
you
are
like
my
poor
jeanne
dear
child
he
said
teach
me
what
would
give
you
pleasure
and
i
will
give
you
all
you
can
desire
grow
strong
be
well
i
will
show
you
how
to
ride
a
mare
as
pretty
and
gentle
as
yourself
nothing
shall
ever
thwart
or
trouble
you
all
things
bow
to
me
as
the
reeds
to
the
wind
i
give
you
unlimited
power
i
bow
to
you
myself
as
the
god
of
the
the
father
carried
his
son
into
the
lordly
chamber
where
the
mother
s
sad
existence
had
been
spent
etienne
turned
away
and
leaned
against
the
window
from
which
his
mother
was
wont
to
make
him
signals
announcing
the
departure
of
his
persecutor
who
now
without
his
knowing
why
had
become
his
slave
like
those
gigantic
genii
which
the
power
of
a
fairy
places
at
the
order
of
a
young
prince
that
fairy
was
feudality
beholding
once
more
the
melancholy
room
where
his
eyes
were
accustomed
to
contemplate
the
ocean
tears
came
into
those
eyes
recollections
of
his
long
misery
mingled
with
melodious
memories
of
the
pleasures
he
had
had
in
the
only
love
that
was
granted
to
him
maternal
love
all
rushed
together
upon
his
heart
and
developed
there
like
a
poem
at
once
terrible
and
delicious
the
emotions
of
this
youth
accustomed
to
live
in
contemplations
of
ecstasy
as
others
in
the
excitements
of
the
world
resembled
none
of
the
habitual
emotions
of
mankind
will
he
live
said
the
old
man
amazed
at
the
fragility
of
his
heir
and
holding
his
breath
as
he
leaned
over
him
i
can
live
only
here
replied
etienne
who
had
heard
him
simply
well
then
this
room
shall
be
yours
my
what
is
that
noise
asked
the
young
man
hearing
the
retainers
of
the
castle
who
were
gathering
in
the
whither
the
duke
had
summoned
them
to
present
his
son
come
said
the
father
taking
him
by
the
hand
and
leading
him
into
the
great
hall
at
this
epoch
of
our
history
a
duke
and
peer
with
great
possessions
holding
public
offices
and
the
government
of
a
province
lived
the
life
of
a
prince
the
cadets
of
his
family
did
not
revolt
at
serving
him
he
had
his
household
guard
and
officers
the
first
lieutenant
of
his
ordnance
company
was
to
him
what
in
our
day
an
is
to
a
marshal
a
few
years
later
cardinal
de
richelieu
had
his
several
princes
allied
to
the
royal
house
guise
conde
nevers
and
vendome
had
pages
chosen
among
the
sons
of
the
best
families
a
last
lingering
custom
of
departed
chivalry
the
wealth
of
the
duc
d
herouville
and
the
antiquity
of
his
norman
race
indicated
by
his
name
herus
villoe
permitted
him
to
imitate
the
magnificence
of
families
who
were
in
other
respects
his
inferiors
those
for
instance
of
epernon
luynes
balagny
d
o
zamet
regarded
as
parvenus
but
living
nevertheless
as
princes
it
was
therefore
an
imposing
spectacle
for
poor
etienne
to
see
the
assemblage
of
retainers
of
all
kinds
attached
to
the
service
of
his
father
the
duke
seated
himself
on
a
chair
of
state
placed
under
a
solium
or
dais
of
carved
word
above
a
platform
raised
by
several
steps
from
which
in
certain
provinces
the
great
seigneurs
still
delivered
judgment
on
their
vassals
a
vestige
of
feudality
which
disappeared
under
the
reign
of
richelieu
these
thrones
like
the
warden
s
benches
of
the
churches
have
now
become
objects
of
collection
as
curiosities
when
etienne
was
placed
beside
his
father
on
that
raised
platform
he
shuddered
at
feeling
himself
the
centre
to
which
all
eyes
turned
do
not
tremble
said
the
duke
bending
his
bald
head
to
his
son
s
ear
these
people
are
only
our
through
the
dusky
light
produced
by
the
setting
sun
the
rays
of
which
were
reddening
the
leaded
panes
of
the
windows
etienne
saw
the
bailiff
the
captain
and
lieutenant
of
the
guard
with
certain
of
their
the
chaplain
the
secretaries
the
doctor
the
majordomo
the
ushers
the
steward
the
huntsmen
the
the
grooms
and
the
valets
though
all
these
people
stood
in
respectful
attitudes
induced
by
the
terror
the
old
man
inspired
in
even
the
most
important
persons
under
his
command
a
low
murmur
caused
by
curiosity
and
expectation
made
itself
heard
that
sound
oppressed
the
bosom
of
the
young
man
who
felt
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
influence
of
the
heavy
atmosphere
produced
by
the
breath
of
many
persons
in
a
closed
hall
his
senses
accustomed
to
the
pure
and
wholesome
air
from
the
sea
were
shocked
with
a
rapidity
that
proved
the
of
his
organs
a
horrible
palpitation
due
no
doubt
to
some
defect
in
the
organization
of
his
heart
shook
him
with
reiterated
blows
when
his
father
showing
himself
to
the
assemblage
like
some
majestic
old
lion
pronounced
in
a
solemn
voice
the
following
brief
address
my
friends
this
is
my
son
etienne
my
son
my
heir
presumptive
the
duc
de
nivron
to
whom
the
king
will
no
doubt
grant
the
honors
of
his
deceased
brother
i
present
him
to
you
that
you
may
acknowledge
him
and
obey
him
as
myself
i
warn
you
that
if
you
or
any
one
in
this
province
over
which
i
am
governor
does
aught
to
displease
the
young
duke
or
thwart
him
in
any
way
whatsoever
it
would
be
better
should
it
come
to
my
knowledge
that
that
man
had
never
been
born
you
hear
me
return
now
to
your
duties
and
god
guide
you
the
obsequies
of
my
son
maximilien
will
take
place
here
when
his
body
arrives
the
household
will
go
into
mourning
eight
days
hence
later
we
shall
celebrate
the
accession
of
my
son
etienne
here
vive
monseigneur
long
live
the
race
of
herouville
cried
the
people
in
a
roar
that
shook
the
castle
the
valets
brought
in
torches
to
illuminate
the
hall
that
hurrah
the
sudden
lights
the
sensations
caused
by
his
father
s
speech
joined
to
those
he
was
already
feeling
overcame
the
young
man
who
fainted
completely
and
fell
into
a
chair
leaving
his
slender
womanly
hand
in
the
broad
palm
of
his
father
as
the
duke
who
had
signed
to
the
lieutenant
of
his
company
to
come
nearer
saying
to
him
i
am
fortunate
baron
d
artagnon
in
being
able
to
repair
my
loss
behold
my
son
he
felt
an
icy
hand
in
his
turning
round
he
looked
at
the
new
duc
de
nivron
and
thinking
him
dead
he
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
which
appalled
the
assemblage
beauvouloir
rushed
to
the
platform
took
the
young
man
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
away
saying
to
his
master
you
have
killed
him
by
not
preparing
him
for
this
he
can
never
have
a
child
if
he
is
like
that
cried
the
duke
following
beauvouloir
into
the
seignorial
chamber
where
the
doctor
laid
the
young
heir
upon
the
bed
well
what
think
you
asked
the
duke
presently
it
is
not
serious
replied
the
old
physician
showing
etienne
who
was
now
revived
by
a
cordial
a
few
drops
of
which
he
had
given
him
on
a
bit
of
sugar
a
new
and
precious
substance
which
the
apothecaries
were
selling
for
its
weight
in
gold
take
this
old
rascal
said
the
duke
offering
his
purse
to
beauvouloir
and
treat
him
like
the
son
of
a
king
if
he
dies
by
your
fault
i
ll
burn
you
myself
on
a
if
you
continue
to
be
so
violent
the
duc
de
nivron
will
die
by
your
own
act
said
the
doctor
roughly
leave
him
now
he
will
go
to
my
love
said
the
old
man
kissing
his
son
upon
the
forehead
father
replied
the
youth
whose
voice
made
the
father
thus
named
by
etienne
for
the
first
time
quiver
the
duke
took
beauvouloir
by
the
arm
and
led
him
to
the
next
room
where
having
pushed
him
into
the
recess
of
a
window
he
said
ah
ca
old
rascal
now
we
will
understand
each
that
term
a
favorite
sign
of
graciousness
with
the
duke
made
the
doctor
no
longer
a
mere
bonesetter
smile
you
know
said
the
duke
continuing
that
i
wish
you
no
harm
you
have
twice
delivered
my
poor
jeanne
you
cured
my
son
maximilien
of
an
illness
in
short
you
are
a
part
of
my
household
poor
maximilien
i
will
avenge
him
i
take
upon
myself
to
kill
the
man
who
killed
him
the
whole
future
of
the
house
of
herouville
is
now
in
your
hands
you
alone
can
know
if
there
is
in
that
poor
abortion
the
stuff
that
can
breed
a
herouville
you
hear
me
what
think
you
his
life
on
the
seashore
has
been
so
chaste
and
so
pure
that
nature
is
sounder
in
him
than
it
would
have
been
had
he
lived
in
your
world
but
so
delicate
a
body
is
the
very
humble
servant
of
the
soul
monseigneur
etienne
must
himself
choose
his
wife
all
things
in
him
must
be
the
work
of
nature
and
not
of
your
will
he
will
love
artlessly
and
will
accomplish
by
his
heart
s
desire
that
which
you
wish
him
to
do
for
the
sake
of
your
name
but
if
you
give
your
son
a
proud
ungainly
woman
of
the
world
a
great
lady
he
will
flee
to
his
rocks
more
than
that
though
sudden
terror
would
surely
kill
him
i
believe
that
any
sudden
emotion
would
be
equally
fatal
my
advice
therefore
is
to
leave
etienne
to
choose
for
himself
at
his
own
pleasure
the
path
of
love
listen
to
me
monseigneur
you
are
a
great
and
powerful
prince
but
you
understand
nothing
of
such
matters
give
me
your
entire
confidence
your
unlimited
confidence
and
you
shall
have
a
if
i
obtain
a
grandson
by
any
sorcery
whatever
i
shall
have
you
ennobled
yes
difficult
as
it
may
be
i
ll
make
an
old
rascal
into
a
man
of
honor
you
shall
be
baron
de
forcalier
employ
your
magic
white
or
black
appeal
to
your
witches
sabbath
or
the
novenas
of
the
church
what
care
i
how
tis
done
provided
my
line
male
continues
i
know
said
beauvouloir
a
whole
chapter
of
sorcerers
capable
of
destroying
your
hopes
they
are
none
other
than
monseigneur
i
know
you
you
want
male
lineage
at
any
price
you
will
seek
to
have
it
on
your
own
conditions
you
will
torment
your
god
preserve
me
from
it
well
then
go
away
from
here
go
to
court
where
the
death
of
the
marechal
and
the
emancipation
of
the
king
must
have
turned
everything
topsy
turvy
and
where
you
certainly
have
business
if
only
to
obtain
the
marshal
s
baton
which
was
promised
to
you
leave
monseigneur
etienne
to
me
but
give
me
your
word
of
honor
as
a
gentleman
to
approve
whatever
i
may
do
for
the
duke
struck
his
hand
into
that
of
his
physician
as
a
sign
of
complete
acceptance
and
retired
to
his
own
apartments
when
the
days
of
a
high
and
mighty
seigneur
are
numbered
the
physician
becomes
a
personage
of
importance
in
the
household
it
is
therefore
not
surprising
to
see
a
former
bonesetter
so
familiar
with
the
duc
d
herouville
apart
from
the
illegitimate
ties
which
connected
him
by
marriage
to
this
great
family
and
certainly
militated
in
his
favor
his
sound
good
sense
had
so
often
been
proved
by
the
duke
that
the
old
man
had
now
become
his
master
s
most
valued
counsellor
beauvouloir
was
the
coyctier
of
this
louis
xi
nevertheless
and
no
matter
how
valuable
his
knowledge
might
be
he
never
obtained
over
the
government
of
normandy
in
whom
was
the
ferocity
of
religious
warfare
as
much
influence
as
feudality
exercised
over
that
rugged
nature
for
this
reason
the
physician
was
confident
that
the
prejudices
of
the
noble
would
thwart
the
desires
and
the
vows
of
the
father
chapter
gabrielle
great
physician
that
he
was
beauvouloir
saw
plainly
that
to
a
being
so
delicately
organized
as
etienne
marriage
must
come
as
a
slow
and
gentle
inspiration
communicating
new
powers
to
his
being
and
vivifying
it
with
the
fires
of
love
as
he
had
said
to
the
father
to
impose
a
wife
on
etienne
would
be
to
kill
him
above
all
it
was
important
that
the
young
recluse
should
not
be
alarmed
at
the
thought
of
marriage
of
which
he
knew
nothing
or
be
made
aware
of
the
object
of
his
father
s
wishes
this
unknown
poet
conceived
as
yet
only
the
beautiful
and
noble
passion
of
petrarch
for
laura
of
dante
for
beatrice
like
his
mother
he
was
all
pure
love
and
soul
the
opportunity
to
love
must
be
given
to
him
and
then
the
event
should
be
awaited
not
compelled
a
command
to
love
would
have
dried
within
him
the
very
sources
of
his
life
maitre
antoine
beauvouloir
was
a
father
he
had
a
daughter
brought
up
under
conditions
which
made
her
the
wife
for
etienne
it
was
so
difficult
to
foresee
the
events
which
would
make
a
son
disowned
by
his
father
and
destined
to
the
priesthood
the
presumptive
heir
of
the
house
of
herouville
that
beauvouloir
had
never
until
now
noticed
the
resemblance
between
the
fate
of
etienne
and
that
of
gabrielle
a
sudden
idea
which
now
came
to
him
was
inspired
more
by
his
devotion
to
those
two
beings
than
by
ambition
his
wife
in
spite
of
his
great
skill
had
died
in
leaving
him
a
daughter
whose
health
was
so
frail
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
mother
had
bequeathed
to
her
fruit
the
germs
of
death
beauvouloir
loved
his
gabrielle
as
old
men
love
their
only
child
his
science
and
his
incessant
care
had
given
factitious
life
to
this
frail
creature
which
he
cultivated
as
a
florist
cultivates
an
exotic
plant
he
had
kept
her
hidden
from
all
eyes
on
his
estate
of
forcalier
where
she
was
protected
against
the
dangers
of
the
time
by
the
general
felt
for
a
man
to
whom
all
owed
gratitude
and
whose
scientific
powers
inspired
in
the
ignorant
minds
of
the
a
superstitious
awe
by
attaching
himself
to
the
house
of
herouville
beauvouloir
had
increased
still
further
the
immunity
he
enjoyed
in
the
province
and
had
thwarted
all
attempts
of
his
enemies
by
means
of
his
powerful
influence
with
the
governor
he
had
taken
care
however
in
coming
to
reside
at
the
castle
not
to
bring
with
him
the
flower
he
cherished
in
secret
at
forcalier
a
domain
more
important
for
its
landed
value
than
for
the
house
then
upon
it
but
with
which
he
expected
to
obtain
for
his
daughter
an
establishment
in
conformity
with
his
views
while
promising
the
duke
a
posterity
and
requiring
his
master
s
word
of
honor
to
approve
his
acts
he
thought
suddenly
of
gabrielle
of
that
sweet
child
whose
mother
had
been
neglected
and
forgotten
by
the
duke
as
he
had
also
neglected
and
forgotten
his
son
etienne
he
awaited
the
departure
of
his
master
before
putting
his
plan
into
execution
foreseeing
that
if
the
duke
became
aware
of
it
the
enormous
difficulties
in
the
way
would
be
from
the
first
insurmountable
beauvouloir
s
house
at
forcalier
had
a
southern
exposure
on
the
slope
of
one
of
those
gentle
hills
which
surround
the
vales
of
normandy
a
thick
wood
shielded
it
from
the
north
high
walls
and
norman
hedges
and
deep
ditches
made
the
enclosure
inviolable
the
garden
descending
by
an
easy
incline
to
the
river
which
watered
the
valley
had
a
thick
double
hedge
at
its
foot
forming
an
natural
embankment
within
this
double
hedge
wound
a
hidden
path
led
by
the
sinuosities
of
the
stream
which
the
willows
oaks
and
beeches
made
as
leafy
as
a
woodland
glade
from
the
house
to
this
natural
rampart
stretched
a
mass
of
verdure
peculiar
to
that
rich
soil
a
beautiful
green
sheet
bordered
by
a
fringe
of
rare
trees
the
tones
of
which
formed
a
tapestry
of
exquisite
coloring
there
the
silvery
tints
of
a
pine
stood
forth
against
the
darker
green
of
several
alders
here
before
a
group
of
sturdy
oaks
a
slender
poplar
lifted
its
figure
ever
swaying
farther
on
the
weeping
willows
drooped
their
pale
foliage
between
the
stout
walnuts
this
belt
of
trees
enabled
the
occupants
of
the
house
to
go
down
at
all
hours
to
the
fearless
of
the
rays
of
the
sun
the
facade
of
the
house
before
which
lay
the
yellow
ribbon
of
a
gravelled
terrace
was
shaded
by
a
wooden
gallery
around
which
climbing
plants
were
twining
and
tossing
in
this
month
of
may
their
various
blossoms
into
the
very
windows
of
the
second
floor
without
being
really
vast
this
garden
seemed
immense
from
the
manner
in
which
its
vistas
were
cut
points
of
view
cleverly
contrived
through
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
ground
married
themselves
as
it
were
to
those
of
the
valley
where
the
eye
could
rove
at
will
following
the
instincts
of
her
thought
gabrielle
could
either
enter
the
solitude
of
a
narrow
space
seeing
naught
but
the
thick
green
and
the
blue
of
the
sky
above
the
or
she
could
hover
above
a
glorious
prospect
letting
her
eyes
follow
those
green
lines
from
the
brilliant
colors
of
the
foreground
to
the
pure
tones
of
the
horizon
on
which
they
lost
themselves
sometimes
in
the
blue
ocean
of
the
atmosphere
sometimes
in
the
cumuli
that
floated
above
it
watched
over
by
her
grandmother
and
served
by
her
former
nurse
gabrielle
beauvouloir
never
left
this
modest
home
except
for
the
parish
church
the
steeple
of
which
could
be
seen
at
the
summit
of
the
hill
whither
she
was
always
accompanied
by
her
grandmother
her
nurse
and
her
father
s
valet
she
had
reached
the
age
of
seventeen
in
that
sweet
ignorance
which
the
rarity
of
books
allowed
a
girl
to
retain
without
appearing
extraordinary
at
a
period
when
educated
women
were
thought
phenomenal
the
house
had
been
to
her
a
convent
but
with
more
freedom
less
enforced
prayer
a
retreat
where
she
had
lived
beneath
the
eye
of
a
pious
old
woman
and
the
protection
of
her
father
the
only
man
she
had
ever
known
this
absolute
solitude
necessitated
from
her
birth
by
the
apparent
feebleness
of
her
constitution
had
been
carefully
maintained
by
beauvouloir
as
gabrielle
grew
up
such
constant
care
and
the
purity
of
the
atmosphere
had
gradually
strengthened
her
fragile
youth
still
the
wise
physician
did
not
deceive
himself
when
he
saw
the
pearly
tints
around
his
daughter
s
eyes
soften
or
darken
or
flush
according
to
the
emotions
that
overcame
her
the
weakness
of
the
body
and
the
strength
of
the
soul
were
made
plain
to
him
in
that
one
indication
which
his
long
experience
enabled
him
to
understand
besides
this
gabrielle
s
celestial
beauty
made
him
fearful
of
attempts
too
common
in
times
of
violence
and
sedition
many
reasons
had
thus
induced
the
good
father
to
deepen
the
shadows
and
increase
the
solitude
that
surrounded
his
daughter
whose
excessive
sensibility
alarmed
him
a
passion
an
assault
a
shock
of
any
kind
might
wound
her
mortally
though
she
seldom
deserved
blame
a
mere
word
of
reproach
overcame
her
she
kept
it
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
where
it
fostered
a
meditative
melancholy
she
would
turn
away
weeping
and
wept
long
thus
the
moral
education
of
the
young
girl
required
no
less
care
than
her
physical
education
the
old
physician
had
been
compelled
to
cease
telling
stories
such
as
all
children
love
to
his
daughter
the
impressions
she
received
were
too
vivid
wise
through
long
practice
he
endeavored
to
develop
her
body
in
order
to
deaden
the
blows
which
a
soul
so
powerful
gave
to
it
gabrielle
was
all
of
life
and
love
to
her
father
his
only
heir
and
never
had
he
hesitated
to
procure
for
her
such
things
as
might
produce
the
results
he
aimed
for
he
carefully
removed
from
her
knowledge
books
pictures
music
all
those
creations
of
art
which
awaken
thought
aided
by
his
mother
he
interested
gabrielle
in
manual
exercises
tapestry
sewing
the
culture
of
flowers
household
cares
the
storage
of
fruits
in
short
the
most
material
occupations
of
life
were
the
food
given
to
the
mind
of
this
charming
creature
beauvouloir
brought
her
beautiful
chests
rich
carpets
pottery
of
bernard
de
palissy
tables
chairs
beautifully
wrought
and
covered
with
precious
stuffs
embroidered
line
and
jewels
with
an
instinct
given
by
paternity
the
old
man
always
chose
his
presents
among
the
works
of
that
fantastic
order
called
arabesque
which
speaking
neither
to
the
soul
nor
the
senses
addresses
the
mind
only
by
its
creations
of
pure
fantasy
thus
singular
to
say
the
life
which
the
hatred
of
a
father
had
imposed
on
etienne
d
herouville
paternal
love
had
induced
beauvouloir
to
impose
on
gabrielle
in
both
these
children
the
soul
was
killing
the
body
and
without
an
absolute
solitude
ordained
by
cruelty
for
one
and
procured
by
science
for
the
other
each
was
likely
to
succumb
he
to
terror
she
beneath
the
weight
of
a
too
keen
emotion
of
love
but
alas
instead
of
being
born
in
a
region
of
gorse
and
moor
in
the
midst
of
an
arid
nature
of
hard
and
angular
shapes
such
as
all
great
painters
have
given
as
backgrounds
to
their
virgins
gabrielle
lived
in
a
rich
and
fertile
valley
beauvouloir
could
not
destroy
the
harmonious
grouping
of
the
native
woods
the
graceful
upspringing
of
the
wild
flowers
the
cool
softness
of
the
grassy
slopes
the
love
expressed
in
the
intertwining
growth
of
the
clustering
plants
such
poesies
have
a
language
heard
rather
than
understood
by
the
poor
girl
who
yielded
to
vague
misery
among
the
shadows
across
the
misty
ideas
suggested
by
her
long
study
of
this
beautiful
landscape
observed
at
all
seasons
and
through
all
the
variations
of
a
marine
atmosphere
in
which
the
fogs
of
england
come
to
die
and
the
sunshine
of
france
is
born
there
rose
within
her
soul
a
distant
light
a
dawn
which
pierced
the
darkness
in
which
her
father
kept
her
beauvouloir
had
never
withdrawn
his
daughter
from
the
influence
of
divine
love
to
a
deep
admiration
of
nature
she
joined
her
girlish
adoration
of
the
creator
springing
thus
into
the
first
way
open
to
the
feelings
of
womanhood
she
loved
god
she
loved
jesus
the
virgin
and
the
saints
she
loved
the
church
and
its
pomps
she
was
catholic
after
the
manner
of
saint
teresa
who
saw
in
jesus
an
eternal
spouse
a
continual
marriage
gabrielle
gave
herself
up
to
this
passion
of
strong
souls
with
so
touching
a
simplicity
that
she
would
have
disarmed
the
most
brutal
seducer
by
the
infantine
naivete
of
her
language
whither
was
this
life
of
innocence
leading
gabrielle
how
teach
a
mind
as
pure
as
the
water
of
a
tranquil
lake
reflecting
only
the
azure
of
the
skies
what
images
should
be
drawn
upon
that
spotless
canvas
around
which
tree
must
the
tendrils
of
this
twine
no
father
has
ever
put
these
questions
to
himself
without
an
inward
shudder
at
this
moment
the
good
old
man
of
science
was
riding
slowly
on
his
mule
along
the
roads
from
herouville
to
ourscamp
the
name
of
the
village
near
which
the
estate
of
forcalier
was
situated
as
if
he
wished
to
keep
that
way
unending
the
infinite
love
he
bore
his
daughter
suggested
a
bold
project
to
his
mind
one
only
being
in
all
the
world
could
make
her
happy
that
man
was
etienne
assuredly
the
angelic
son
of
jeanne
de
and
the
guileless
daughter
of
gertrude
marana
were
twin
beings
all
other
women
would
frighten
and
kill
the
heir
of
herouville
and
gabrielle
so
beauvouloir
argued
would
perish
by
contact
with
any
man
in
whom
sentiments
and
external
forms
had
not
the
virgin
delicacy
of
those
of
etienne
certainly
the
poor
physician
had
never
dreamed
of
such
a
result
chance
had
brought
it
forward
and
seemed
to
ordain
it
but
under
the
reign
of
louis
to
dare
to
lead
a
duc
d
herouville
to
marry
the
daughter
of
a
bonesetter
and
yet
from
this
marriage
alone
was
it
likely
that
the
lineage
imperiously
demanded
by
the
old
duke
would
result
nature
had
destined
these
two
rare
beings
for
each
other
god
had
brought
them
together
by
a
marvellous
arrangement
of
events
while
at
the
same
time
human
ideas
and
laws
placed
insuperable
barriers
between
them
though
the
old
man
thought
he
saw
in
this
the
finger
of
god
and
although
he
had
forced
the
duke
to
pass
his
word
he
was
seized
with
such
fear
as
his
thoughts
reverted
to
the
violence
of
that
ungovernable
nature
that
he
returned
upon
his
steps
when
on
reaching
the
summit
of
the
hill
above
ourscamp
he
saw
the
smoke
of
his
own
chimneys
among
the
trees
that
enclosed
his
home
then
changing
his
mind
once
more
the
thought
of
the
illegitimate
relationship
decided
him
that
consideration
might
have
great
influence
on
the
mind
of
his
master
once
decided
beauvouloir
had
confidence
in
the
chances
and
changes
of
life
it
might
be
that
the
duke
would
die
before
the
marriage
besides
there
were
many
examples
of
such
marriage
a
peasant
girl
in
dauphine
francoise
mignot
had
lately
married
the
marechal
d
hopital
the
son
of
the
connetable
anne
de
montmorency
had
married
diane
daughter
of
henri
ii
and
a
piedmontese
lady
named
philippa
duc
during
this
mental
deliberation
in
which
paternal
love
measured
all
probabilities
and
discussed
both
the
good
and
the
evil
chances
striving
to
foresee
the
future
and
weighing
its
elements
gabrielle
was
walking
in
the
garden
and
gathering
flowers
for
the
vases
of
that
illustrious
potter
who
did
for
glaze
what
benvenuto
cellini
did
for
metal
gabrielle
had
put
one
of
these
vases
decorated
with
animals
in
relief
on
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
and
was
filling
it
with
flowers
to
enliven
her
grandmother
and
also
perhaps
to
give
form
to
her
own
ideas
the
noble
vase
of
the
pottery
called
limoges
was
filled
arranged
and
placed
upon
the
handsome
and
gabrielle
was
saying
to
her
grandmother
see
when
beauvouloir
entered
the
young
girl
ran
to
her
father
s
arms
after
this
first
outburst
of
affection
she
wanted
him
to
admire
her
bouquet
but
the
old
man
after
glancing
at
it
cast
a
long
deep
look
at
his
daughter
which
made
her
blush
the
time
has
come
he
said
to
himself
understanding
the
language
of
those
flowers
each
of
which
had
doubtless
been
studied
as
to
form
and
as
to
color
and
given
its
true
place
in
the
bouquet
where
it
produced
its
own
magical
effect
gabrielle
remained
standing
forgetting
the
flower
begun
on
her
tapestry
as
he
looked
at
his
daughter
a
tear
rolled
from
beauvouloir
s
eyes
furrowed
his
cheeks
which
seldom
wore
a
serious
aspect
and
fell
upon
his
shirt
which
after
the
fashion
of
the
day
his
open
doublet
exposed
to
view
above
his
breeches
he
threw
off
his
felt
hat
adorned
with
an
old
red
plume
in
order
to
rub
his
hand
over
his
bald
head
again
he
looked
at
his
daughter
who
beneath
the
brown
rafters
of
that
room
with
its
ebony
furniture
and
portieres
of
silken
damask
and
its
tall
the
whole
so
softly
lighted
was
still
his
very
own
the
poor
father
felt
the
tears
in
his
eyes
and
hastened
to
wipe
them
a
father
who
loves
his
daughter
longs
to
keep
her
always
a
child
as
for
him
who
can
without
deep
pain
see
her
fall
under
the
dominion
of
another
man
he
does
not
rise
to
worlds
superior
he
falls
to
lowest
space
what
ails
you
my
son
said
his
old
mother
taking
off
her
spectacles
and
seeking
the
cause
of
his
silence
and
of
the
change
in
his
usually
joyous
manner
the
old
physician
signed
to
the
old
mother
to
look
at
his
daughter
nodding
his
head
with
satisfaction
as
if
to
say
how
sweet
she
is
what
father
would
not
have
felt
beauvouloir
s
emotion
on
seeing
the
young
girl
as
she
stood
there
in
the
norman
dress
of
that
period
gabrielle
wore
the
corset
pointed
before
and
square
behind
which
the
italian
masters
give
almost
invariably
to
their
saints
and
their
madonnas
this
elegant
corselet
made
of
velvet
as
dainty
as
that
of
a
enclosed
the
bust
like
a
guimpe
and
compressed
it
delicately
modelling
the
outline
as
it
seemed
to
flatten
it
moulded
the
shoulders
the
back
the
waist
with
the
precision
of
a
drawing
made
by
an
able
draftsman
ending
around
the
neck
in
an
oblong
curve
adorned
at
the
edges
with
a
slight
embroidery
in
brown
silks
leaving
to
view
as
much
of
the
bare
throat
as
was
needed
to
show
the
beauty
of
her
womanhood
but
not
enough
to
awaken
desire
a
full
brown
skirt
continuing
the
lines
already
drawn
by
the
velvet
waist
fell
to
her
feet
in
narrow
flattened
pleats
her
figure
was
so
slender
that
gabrielle
seemed
tall
her
arms
hung
pendent
with
the
inertia
that
some
deep
thought
imparts
to
the
attitude
thus
standing
she
presented
a
living
model
of
those
ingenuous
works
of
statuary
a
taste
for
which
prevailed
at
that
period
works
which
obtained
admiration
for
the
harmony
of
their
lines
straight
without
stiffness
and
for
the
firmness
of
a
design
which
did
not
exclude
vitality
no
swallow
brushing
the
at
dusk
ever
conveyed
the
idea
of
greater
elegance
of
outline
gabrielle
s
face
was
thin
but
not
flat
on
her
neck
and
forehead
ran
bluish
threads
showing
the
delicacy
of
a
skin
so
transparent
that
the
flowing
of
the
blood
through
her
veins
seemed
visible
this
excessive
whiteness
was
faintly
tinted
with
rose
upon
the
cheeks
held
beneath
a
little
coif
of
velvet
embroidered
with
pearls
her
hair
of
an
even
tone
flowed
like
two
rivulets
of
gold
from
her
temples
and
played
in
ringlets
on
her
neck
which
it
did
not
hide
the
glowing
color
of
those
silky
locks
brightened
the
dazzling
whiteness
of
the
neck
and
purified
still
further
by
its
reflections
the
outlines
of
the
face
already
so
pure
the
eyes
which
were
long
and
as
if
pressed
between
their
lids
were
in
harmony
with
the
delicacy
of
the
head
and
body
their
tints
were
brilliant
without
vivacity
candid
without
passion
the
line
of
the
nose
might
have
seemed
cold
like
a
steel
blade
without
two
rosy
nostrils
the
movements
of
which
were
out
of
keeping
with
the
chastity
of
that
dreamy
brow
often
perplexed
sometimes
smiling
but
always
of
an
august
serenity
an
alert
little
ear
attracted
the
eye
peeping
beneath
the
coif
and
between
two
curls
and
showing
a
ruby
the
color
of
which
stood
vigorously
out
on
the
milky
whiteness
of
the
neck
this
was
neither
norman
beauty
where
flesh
abounds
nor
french
beauty
as
fugitive
as
its
own
expressions
nor
the
beauty
of
the
north
cold
and
melancholy
as
the
north
itself
it
was
the
deep
seraphic
beauty
of
the
catholic
church
supple
and
rigid
severe
but
tender
where
could
one
find
a
prettier
duchess
thought
beauvouloir
contemplating
his
daughter
with
delight
as
she
stood
there
slightly
bending
her
neck
stretched
out
to
watch
the
flight
of
a
bird
past
the
windows
he
could
only
compare
her
to
a
gazelle
pausing
to
listen
for
the
ripple
of
the
water
where
she
seeks
to
drink
come
and
sit
here
said
beauvouloir
tapping
his
knee
and
making
a
sign
to
gabrielle
which
told
her
he
had
something
to
whisper
to
her
gabrielle
understood
him
and
came
she
placed
herself
on
his
knee
with
the
lightness
of
a
gazelle
and
slipped
her
arm
about
his
neck
ruffling
his
collar
tell
me
he
said
what
were
you
thinking
of
when
you
gathered
those
flowers
you
have
never
before
arranged
them
so
i
was
thinking
of
many
things
she
answered
looking
at
the
flowers
made
for
us
i
wondered
whom
we
were
made
for
who
are
they
who
look
at
us
you
are
wise
and
i
can
tell
you
what
i
think
you
know
so
much
you
can
explain
all
i
feel
a
sort
of
force
within
me
that
wants
to
exercise
itself
i
struggle
against
something
when
the
sky
is
gray
i
am
half
content
i
am
sad
but
i
am
calm
when
the
day
is
fine
and
the
flowers
smell
sweet
and
i
sit
on
my
bench
down
there
among
the
jasmine
and
honeysuckles
something
rises
in
me
like
waves
which
beat
against
my
stillness
ideas
come
into
my
mind
which
shake
me
and
fly
away
like
those
birds
before
the
windows
i
can
not
hold
them
well
when
i
have
made
a
bouquet
in
which
the
colors
blend
like
tapestry
and
the
red
contrasts
with
white
and
the
greens
and
the
browns
cross
each
other
when
all
seems
so
abundant
the
breeze
so
playful
the
flowers
so
many
that
their
fragrance
mingles
and
their
buds
interlace
well
then
i
am
happy
for
i
see
what
is
passing
in
me
at
church
when
the
organ
plays
and
the
clergy
respond
there
are
two
distinct
songs
speaking
to
each
other
the
human
voice
and
the
music
well
then
too
i
am
happy
that
harmony
echoes
in
my
breast
i
pray
with
a
pleasure
which
stirs
my
while
listening
to
his
daughter
beauvouloir
examined
her
with
sagacious
eyes
those
eyes
seemed
almost
stupid
from
the
force
of
his
rushing
thoughts
as
the
water
of
a
cascade
seems
motionless
he
raised
the
veil
of
flesh
which
hid
the
secret
springs
by
which
the
soul
reacts
upon
the
body
he
studied
the
diverse
symptoms
which
his
long
experience
had
noted
in
persons
committed
to
his
care
and
he
compared
them
with
those
contained
in
this
frail
body
the
bones
of
which
frightened
him
by
their
delicacy
as
the
skin
alarmed
him
by
its
want
of
substance
he
tried
to
bring
the
teachings
of
his
science
to
bear
upon
the
future
of
that
angelic
child
and
he
was
dizzy
in
so
doing
as
though
he
stood
upon
the
verge
of
an
abyss
the
too
vibrant
voice
the
too
slender
bosom
of
the
young
girl
filled
him
with
dread
and
he
questioned
himself
after
questioning
her
you
suffer
here
he
cried
at
last
driven
by
a
last
thought
which
summed
up
his
whole
meditation
she
bent
her
head
gently
by
god
s
grace
said
the
old
man
with
a
sigh
i
will
take
you
to
the
chateau
d
herouville
and
there
you
shall
take
to
strengthen
is
that
true
father
you
are
not
laughing
at
your
little
gabrielle
i
have
so
longed
to
see
the
castle
and
the
and
the
captains
of
yes
my
daughter
you
shall
really
go
there
your
nurse
and
jean
shall
accompany
soon
said
the
old
man
hurrying
into
the
garden
to
hide
his
agitation
from
his
mother
and
his
child
god
is
my
witness
he
cried
to
himself
that
no
ambitious
thought
impels
me
my
daughter
to
save
poor
little
etienne
to
make
happy
those
are
my
only
if
he
thus
interrogated
himself
it
was
because
in
the
depths
of
his
consciousness
he
felt
an
inextinguishable
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
the
success
of
his
project
would
make
gabrielle
some
day
the
duchesse
d
herouville
there
is
always
a
man
in
a
father
he
walked
about
a
long
time
and
when
he
came
in
to
supper
he
took
delight
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
watching
his
daughter
in
the
midst
of
the
soft
brown
poesy
with
which
he
had
surrounded
her
and
when
before
she
went
to
bed
they
all
the
grandmother
the
nurse
the
doctor
and
gabrielle
knelt
together
to
say
their
evening
prayer
he
added
the
words
let
us
pray
to
god
to
bless
my
the
eyes
of
the
grandmother
who
knew
his
intentions
were
moistened
with
what
tears
remained
to
her
gabrielle
s
face
was
flushed
with
happiness
the
father
trembled
so
much
did
he
fear
some
catastrophe
after
all
his
mother
said
to
him
fear
not
my
son
the
duke
would
never
kill
his
no
he
replied
but
he
might
compel
her
to
marry
some
brute
of
a
baron
and
that
would
kill
the
next
day
gabrielle
mounted
on
an
ass
followed
by
her
nurse
on
foot
her
father
on
his
mule
and
a
valet
who
led
two
horses
laden
with
baggage
started
for
the
castle
of
herouville
where
the
caravan
arrived
at
nightfall
in
order
to
keep
this
journey
secret
beauvouloir
had
taken
starting
early
in
the
morning
and
had
brought
provisions
to
be
eaten
by
the
way
in
order
not
to
show
himself
at
hostelries
the
party
arrived
therefore
after
dark
without
being
noticed
by
the
castle
retinue
at
the
little
dwelling
on
the
seashore
so
long
occupied
by
the
hated
son
where
bertrand
the
only
person
the
doctor
had
taken
into
his
confidence
awaited
them
the
old
retainer
helped
the
nurse
and
valet
to
unload
the
horses
and
carry
in
the
baggage
and
otherwise
establish
the
daughter
of
beauvouloir
in
etienne
s
former
abode
when
bertrand
saw
gabrielle
he
was
amazed
i
seem
to
see
madame
he
cried
she
is
slim
and
willowy
like
her
she
has
madame
s
coloring
and
the
same
fair
hair
the
old
duke
will
surely
love
god
grant
it
said
beauvouloir
but
will
he
acknowledge
his
own
blood
after
it
has
passed
through
mine
he
can
t
deny
it
replied
bertrand
i
often
went
to
fetch
him
from
the
door
of
the
belle
romaine
who
lived
in
the
rue
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
was
compelled
to
give
her
up
to
monseigneur
out
of
shame
at
being
insulted
by
the
mob
when
he
left
her
house
monseigneur
who
in
those
days
was
still
in
his
twenties
will
remember
that
affair
bold
he
was
i
can
tell
it
now
he
led
the
insulters
he
never
thinks
of
the
past
said
beauvouloir
he
knows
my
wife
is
dead
but
i
doubt
if
he
remembers
i
have
a
two
old
navigators
like
you
and
me
ought
to
be
able
to
bring
the
ship
to
port
said
bertrand
after
all
suppose
the
duke
does
get
angry
and
seize
our
carcasses
they
have
served
their
chapter
vi
love
before
starting
for
paris
the
duc
d
herouville
had
forbidden
the
castle
servants
under
heavy
pains
and
penalties
to
go
upon
the
shore
where
etienne
had
passed
his
life
unless
the
duc
de
nivron
took
any
of
them
with
him
this
order
suggested
by
beauvouloir
who
had
shown
the
duke
the
wisdom
of
leaving
etienne
master
of
his
solitude
guaranteed
to
gabrielle
and
her
attendants
the
inviolability
of
the
little
domain
outside
of
which
he
forbade
them
to
go
without
his
permission
etienne
had
remained
during
these
two
days
shut
up
in
the
old
seignorial
bedroom
under
the
spell
of
his
tenderest
memories
in
that
bed
his
mother
had
slept
her
thoughts
had
been
confided
to
the
furnishings
of
that
room
she
had
used
them
her
eyes
had
often
wandered
among
those
draperies
how
often
she
had
gone
to
that
window
to
call
with
a
cry
a
sign
her
poor
disowned
child
now
master
of
the
chateau
alone
in
that
room
whither
he
had
last
come
secretly
brought
by
beauvouloir
to
kiss
his
dying
mother
he
fancied
that
she
lived
again
he
spoke
to
her
he
listened
to
her
he
drank
from
that
spring
that
never
faileth
and
from
which
have
flowed
so
many
songs
like
the
super
flumina
the
day
after
beauvouloir
s
return
he
went
to
see
his
young
master
and
blamed
him
gently
for
shutting
himself
up
in
a
single
room
pointing
out
to
him
the
danger
of
leading
a
prison
life
in
place
of
his
former
free
life
in
the
open
air
but
this
air
is
vast
replied
etienne
the
spirit
of
my
mother
is
in
the
physician
prevailed
however
by
the
gentle
influence
of
affection
in
making
etienne
promise
that
he
would
go
out
every
day
either
on
the
seashore
or
in
the
fields
and
meadows
which
were
still
unknown
to
him
in
spite
of
this
etienne
absorbed
in
his
memories
remained
yet
another
day
at
his
window
watching
the
sea
which
offered
him
from
that
point
of
view
aspects
so
various
that
never
as
he
believed
had
he
seen
it
so
beautiful
he
mingled
his
contemplations
with
readings
in
petrarch
one
of
his
most
favorite
authors
him
whose
poesy
went
nearest
to
the
young
man
s
heart
through
the
constancy
and
the
unity
of
his
love
etienne
had
not
within
him
the
stuff
for
several
passions
he
could
love
but
once
and
in
one
way
only
if
that
love
like
all
that
is
a
unit
were
intense
it
must
also
be
calm
in
its
expression
sweet
and
pure
like
the
sonnets
of
the
italian
poet
at
sunset
this
child
of
solitude
began
to
sing
in
the
marvellous
voice
which
had
entered
suddenly
like
a
hope
into
the
dullest
of
all
ears
to
music
those
of
his
father
he
expressed
his
melancholy
by
varying
the
same
air
which
he
repeated
again
and
again
like
the
nightingale
this
air
attributed
to
the
late
king
henri
was
not
the
air
of
gabrielle
but
something
far
superior
as
art
as
melody
as
the
expression
of
infinite
tenderness
the
admirers
of
those
ancient
tunes
will
recognize
the
words
composed
by
the
great
king
to
this
air
which
were
taken
probably
from
some
to
which
his
cradle
had
been
rocked
among
the
mountains
of
bearn
dawn
approach
i
pray
thee
it
gladdens
me
to
see
thee
the
maiden
whom
i
love
is
rosy
rosy
like
thee
the
rose
itself
has
not
her
freshness
ermine
has
not
her
pureness
lilies
have
not
her
after
naively
revealing
the
thought
of
his
heart
in
song
etienne
contemplated
the
sea
saying
to
himself
there
is
my
bride
the
only
love
for
me
then
he
sang
too
other
lines
of
the
canzonet
she
is
fair
beyond
compare
repeating
it
to
express
the
imploring
poesy
which
abounds
in
the
heart
of
a
timid
young
man
brave
only
when
alone
dreams
were
in
that
undulating
song
sung
resung
interrupted
renewed
and
hushed
at
last
in
a
final
modulation
the
tones
of
which
died
away
like
the
lingering
vibrations
of
a
bell
at
this
moment
a
voice
which
he
fancied
was
that
of
a
siren
rising
from
the
sea
a
woman
s
voice
repeated
the
air
he
had
sung
but
with
all
the
hesitations
of
a
person
to
whom
music
is
revealed
for
the
first
time
he
recognized
the
stammering
of
a
heart
born
into
the
poesy
of
harmony
etienne
to
whom
long
study
of
his
own
voice
had
taught
the
language
of
sounds
in
which
the
soul
finds
resources
greater
than
speech
to
express
its
thoughts
could
divine
the
timid
amazement
that
attended
these
attempts
with
what
religious
and
subtile
admiration
had
that
unknown
being
listened
to
him
the
stillness
of
the
atmosphere
enabled
him
to
hear
every
sound
and
he
quivered
at
the
distant
rustle
of
the
folds
of
a
gown
he
was
amazed
he
whom
all
emotions
produced
by
terror
sent
to
the
verge
of
death
to
feel
within
him
the
healing
balsamic
sensation
which
his
mother
s
coming
had
formerly
brought
to
him
come
gabrielle
my
child
said
the
voice
of
beauvouloir
i
forbade
you
to
stay
upon
the
seashore
after
sundown
you
must
come
in
my
gabrielle
said
etienne
to
himself
oh
the
pretty
name
beauvouloir
presently
came
to
him
rousing
his
young
master
from
one
of
those
meditations
which
resemble
dreams
it
was
night
and
the
moon
was
rising
monseigneur
said
the
physician
you
have
not
been
out
and
it
is
not
wise
of
and
i
replied
etienne
can
go
on
the
seashore
after
sundown
the
double
meaning
of
this
speech
full
of
the
gentle
playfulness
of
a
first
desire
made
the
old
man
smile
you
have
a
daughter
yes
monseigneur
the
child
of
my
old
age
my
darling
child
monseigneur
the
duke
your
father
charged
me
so
earnestly
to
watch
your
precious
health
that
not
being
able
to
go
to
forcalier
where
she
was
i
have
brought
her
here
to
my
great
regret
in
order
to
conceal
her
from
all
eyes
i
have
placed
her
in
the
house
monseigneur
used
to
occupy
she

so
delicate
i
fear
everything
even
a
sudden
sentiment
or
emotion
i
have
never
taught
her
anything
knowledge
would
kill
she

nothing
cried
etienne
surprised
she
has
all
the
talents
of
a
good
housewife
but
she
has
lived
as
the
plants
live
ignorance
monseigneur
is
as
sacred
a
thing
as
knowledge
knowledge
and
ignorance
are
only
two
ways
of
living
for
the
human
creature
both
preserve
the
soul
and
envelop
it
knowledge
is
your
existence
but
ignorance
will
save
my
daughter
s
life
pearls
escape
the
diver
and
live
happy
i
can
only
compare
my
gabrielle
to
a
pearl
her
skin
has
the
pearl
s
translucence
her
soul
its
softness
and
until
this
day
forcalier
has
been
her
fostering
come
with
me
said
etienne
throwing
on
a
cloak
i
want
to
walk
on
the
seashore
the
air
is
so
beauvouloir
and
his
master
walked
in
silence
until
they
reached
a
spot
where
a
line
of
light
coming
from
between
the
shutters
of
a
fisherman
s
house
had
furrowed
the
sea
with
a
golden
rivulet
i
know
not
how
to
express
said
etienne
addressing
his
companion
the
sensations
that
light
cast
upon
the
water
excites
in
me
i
have
often
watched
it
streaming
from
the
windows
of
that
room
he
added
pointing
back
to
his
mother
s
chamber
until
it
was
delicate
as
gabrielle
is
said
beauvouloir
gaily
she
can
come
and
walk
with
us
the
night
is
warm
and
the
air
has
no
dampness
i
will
fetch
her
but
be
prudent
etienne
was
too
timid
to
propose
to
accompany
beauvouloir
into
the
house
besides
he
was
in
that
torpid
state
into
which
we
are
plunged
by
the
influx
of
ideas
and
sensations
which
give
birth
to
the
dawn
of
passion
conscious
of
more
freedom
in
being
alone
he
cried
out
looking
at
the
sea
now
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
the
ocean
has
passed
into
my
soul
the
sight
of
the
lovely
living
statuette
which
was
now
advancing
towards
him
silvered
by
the
moon
and
wrapped
in
its
light
redoubled
the
palpitations
of
his
heart
but
without
causing
him
to
suffer
my
child
said
beauvouloir
this
is
in
a
moment
poor
etienne
longed
for
his
father
s
colossal
figure
he
would
fain
have
seemed
strong
not
puny
all
the
vanities
of
love
and
manhood
came
into
his
heart
like
so
many
arrows
and
he
remained
in
gloomy
silence
measuring
for
the
first
time
the
extent
of
his
imperfections
embarrassed
by
the
salutation
of
the
young
girl
he
returned
it
awkwardly
and
stayed
beside
beauvouloir
with
whom
he
talked
as
they
paced
along
the
shore
presently
however
gabrielle
s
timid
and
deprecating
countenance
emboldened
him
and
he
dared
to
address
her
the
incident
of
the
song
was
the
result
of
mere
chance
beauvouloir
had
intentionally
made
no
preparations
he
thought
wisely
that
between
two
beings
in
whom
solitude
had
left
pure
hearts
love
would
arise
in
all
its
simplicity
the
repetition
of
the
air
by
gabrielle
was
a
ready
text
on
which
to
begin
a
conversation
during
this
promenade
etienne
was
conscious
of
that
bodily
buoyancy
which
all
men
have
felt
at
the
moment
when
a
first
love
transports
their
vital
principle
into
another
being
he
offered
to
teach
gabrielle
to
sing
the
poor
lad
was
so
glad
to
show
himself
to
this
young
girl
invested
with
some
slight
superiority
that
he
trembled
with
pleasure
when
she
accepted
his
offer
at
that
moment
the
moonlight
fell
full
upon
her
and
enabled
etienne
to
note
the
points
of
her
resemblance
to
his
mother
the
late
duchess
like
jeanne
de
beauvouloir
s
daughter
was
slender
and
delicate
in
her
as
in
the
duchess
sadness
and
suffering
conveyed
a
mysterious
charm
she
had
that
nobility
of
manner
peculiar
to
souls
on
whom
the
ways
of
the
world
have
had
no
influence
and
in
whom
all
is
noble
because
all
is
natural
but
in
gabrielle
s
veins
there
was
also
the
blood
of
la
belle
romaine
which
had
flowed
there
from
two
generations
giving
to
this
young
girl
the
passionate
heart
of
a
courtesan
in
an
absolutely
pure
soul
hence
the
enthusiasm
that
sometimes
reddened
her
cheek
sanctified
her
brow
and
made
her
exhale
her
soul
like
a
flash
of
light
and
communicated
the
sparkle
of
flame
to
all
her
motions
beauvouloir
shuddered
when
he
noticed
this
phenomenon
which
we
may
call
in
these
days
the
phosphorescence
of
thought
the
old
physician
of
that
period
regarded
it
as
the
precursor
of
death
hidden
beside
her
father
gabrielle
endeavored
to
see
etienne
at
her
ease
and
her
looks
expressed
as
much
curiosity
as
pleasure
as
much
kindliness
as
innocent
daring
etienne
detected
her
in
stretching
her
neck
around
beauvouloir
with
the
movement
of
a
timid
bird
looking
out
of
its
nest
to
her
the
young
man
seemed
not
feeble
but
delicate
she
found
him
so
like
herself
that
nothing
alarmed
her
in
this
sovereign
lord
etienne
s
sickly
complexion
his
beautiful
hands
his
languid
smile
his
hair
parted
in
the
middle
into
two
straight
bands
ending
in
curls
on
the
lace
of
his
large
flat
collar
his
noble
brow
furrowed
with
youthful
wrinkles
all
these
contrasts
of
luxury
and
weakness
power
and
pettiness
pleased
her
perhaps
they
gratified
the
instinct
of
maternal
protection
which
is
the
germ
of
love
perhaps
also
they
stimulated
the
need
that
every
woman
feels
to
find
distinctive
signs
in
the
man
she
is
prompted
to
love
new
ideas
new
sensations
were
rising
in
each
with
a
force
with
an
abundance
that
enlarged
their
souls
both
remained
silent
and
overcome
for
sentiments
are
least
demonstrative
when
most
real
and
deep
all
durable
love
begins
by
dreamy
meditation
it
was
suitable
that
these
two
beings
should
first
see
each
other
in
the
softer
light
of
the
moon
that
love
and
its
splendors
might
not
dazzle
them
too
suddenly
it
was
well
that
they
met
by
the
shores
of
the
ocean
vast
image
of
the
vastness
of
their
feelings
they
parted
filled
with
one
another
fearing
each
to
have
failed
to
please
from
his
window
etienne
watched
the
lights
of
the
house
where
gabrielle
was
during
that
hour
of
hope
mingled
with
fear
the
young
poet
found
fresh
meanings
in
petrarch
s
sonnets
he
had
now
seen
laura
a
delicate
delightful
figure
pure
and
glowing
like
a
sunray
intelligent
as
an
angel
feeble
as
a
woman
his
twenty
years
of
study
found
their
meaning
he
understood
the
mystic
marriage
of
all
beauties
he
perceived
how
much
of
womanhood
there
was
in
the
poems
he
adored
in
short
he
had
so
long
loved
unconsciously
that
his
whole
past
now
blended
with
the
emotions
of
this
glorious
night
gabrielle
s
resemblance
to
his
mother
seemed
to
him
an
order
divinely
given
he
did
not
betray
his
love
for
the
one
in
loving
the
other
this
new
love
continued
her
maternity
he
contemplated
that
young
girl
asleep
in
the
cottage
with
the
same
feelings
his
mother
had
felt
for
him
when
he
was
there
here
again
was
a
similitude
which
bound
this
present
to
the
past
on
the
clouds
of
memory
the
saddened
face
of
his
mother
appeared
to
him
he
saw
once
more
her
feeble
smile
he
heard
her
gentle
voice
she
bowed
her
head
and
wept
the
lights
in
the
cottage
were
extinguished
etienne
sang
once
more
the
pretty
canzonet
with
a
new
expression
a
new
meaning
from
afar
gabrielle
again
replied
the
young
girl
too
was
making
her
first
voyage
into
the
charmed
land
of
amorous
ecstasy
that
echoed
answer
filled
with
joy
the
young
man
s
heart
the
blood
flowing
in
his
veins
gave
him
a
strength
he
never
yet
had
felt
love
made
him
powerful
feeble
beings
alone
know
the
voluptuous
joy
of
that
new
creation
entering
their
life
the
poor
the
suffering
the
have
joys
ineffable
small
things
to
them
are
worlds
etienne
was
bound
by
many
a
tie
to
the
dwellers
in
the
city
of
sorrows
his
recent
accession
to
grandeur
had
caused
him
terror
only
love
now
shed
within
him
the
balm
that
created
strength
he
loved
love
the
next
day
etienne
rose
early
to
hasten
to
his
old
house
where
gabrielle
stirred
by
curiosity
and
an
impatience
she
did
not
acknowledge
to
herself
had
already
curled
her
hair
and
put
on
her
prettiest
costume
both
were
full
of
the
eager
desire
to
see
each
other
again
mutually
fearing
the
results
of
the
interview
as
for
etienne
he
had
chosen
his
finest
lace
his
mantle
his
breeches
in
short
those
handsome
habiliments
which
we
connect
in
all
memoirs
of
the
time
with
the
pallid
face
of
louis
a
face
oppressed
with
pain
in
the
midst
of
grandeur
like
that
of
etienne
clothes
were
certainly
not
the
only
point
of
resemblance
between
the
king
and
the
subject
many
other
sensibilities
were
in
etienne
as
in
louis
chastity
melancholy
vague
but
real
sufferings
chivalrous
timidities
the
fear
of
not
being
able
to
express
a
feeling
in
all
its
purity
the
dread
of
too
quickly
approaching
happiness
which
all
great
souls
desire
to
delay
the
sense
of
the
burden
of
power
that
tendency
to
obedience
which
is
found
in
natures
indifferent
to
material
interests
but
full
of
love
for
what
a
noble
religious
genius
has
called
the
though
wholly
inexpert
in
the
ways
of
the
world
gabrielle
was
conscious
that
the
daughter
of
a
doctor
the
humble
inhabitant
of
forcalier
was
cast
at
too
great
a
distance
from
monseigneur
etienne
duc
de
nivron
and
heir
to
the
house
of
herouville
to
allow
them
to
be
equal
she
had
as
yet
no
conception
of
the
ennobling
of
love
the
naive
creature
thought
with
no
ambition
of
a
place
where
every
other
girl
would
have
longed
to
seat
herself
she
saw
the
obstacles
only
loving
without
as
yet
knowing
what
it
was
to
love
she
only
felt
herself
distant
from
her
pleasure
and
longed
to
get
nearer
to
it
as
a
child
longs
for
the
golden
grapes
hanging
high
above
its
head
to
a
girl
whose
emotions
were
stirred
at
the
sight
of
a
flower
and
who
had
unconsciously
foreseen
love
in
the
chants
of
the
liturgy
how
sweet
and
how
strong
must
have
been
the
feelings
inspired
in
her
breast
the
previous
night
by
the
sight
of
the
young
seigneur
s
feebleness
which
seemed
to
reassure
her
own
but
during
the
night
etienne
had
been
magnified
to
her
mind
she
had
made
him
a
hope
a
power
she
had
placed
him
so
high
that
now
she
despaired
of
ever
reaching
him
will
you
permit
me
to
sometimes
enter
your
domain
asked
the
duke
lowing
his
eyes
seeing
etienne
so
timid
so
humble
for
he
on
his
part
had
magnified
beauvouloir
s
daughter
gabrielle
was
embarrassed
with
the
sceptre
he
placed
in
her
hands
and
yet
she
was
profoundly
touched
and
flattered
by
such
submission
women
alone
know
what
seduction
the
respect
of
their
master
and
lover
has
for
them
nevertheless
she
feared
to
deceive
herself
and
curious
like
the
first
woman
she
wanted
to
know
all
i
thought
you
promised
yesterday
to
teach
me
music
she
answered
hoping
that
music
might
be
made
a
pretext
for
their
meetings
if
the
poor
child
had
known
what
etienne
s
life
really
was
she
would
have
spared
him
that
doubt
to
him
his
word
was
the
echo
of
his
mind
and
gabrielle
s
little
speech
caused
him
infinite
pain
he
had
come
with
his
heart
full
fearing
some
cloud
upon
his
daylight
and
he
met
a
doubt
his
joy
was
extinguished
back
into
his
desert
he
plunged
no
longer
finding
there
the
flowers
with
which
he
had
embellished
it
with
that
prescience
of
sorrows
which
characterizes
the
angel
charged
to
soften
them
who
is
no
doubt
the
charity
of
heaven
gabrielle
instantly
divined
the
pain
she
had
caused
she
was
so
vividly
aware
of
her
fault
that
she
prayed
for
the
power
of
god
to
lay
bare
her
soul
to
etienne
for
she
knew
the
cruel
pang
a
reproach
or
a
stern
look
was
capable
of
causing
and
she
artlessly
betrayed
to
him
these
clouds
as
they
rose
in
her
soul
the
golden
swathings
of
her
dawning
love
one
tear
which
escaped
her
eyes
turned
etienne
s
pain
to
pleasure
and
he
inwardly
accused
himself
of
tyranny
it
was
fortunate
for
both
that
in
the
very
beginning
of
their
love
they
should
thus
come
to
know
the
diapason
of
their
hearts
they
avoided
henceforth
a
thousand
shocks
which
might
have
wounded
them
etienne
impatient
to
entrench
himself
behind
an
occupation
led
gabrielle
to
a
table
before
the
little
window
at
which
he
himself
had
suffered
so
long
and
where
he
was
henceforth
to
admire
a
flower
more
dainty
than
all
he
had
hitherto
studied
then
he
opened
a
book
over
which
they
bent
their
heads
till
their
hair
touched
and
mingled
these
two
beings
so
strong
in
heart
so
weak
in
body
but
embellished
by
all
the
graces
of
suffering
were
a
touching
sight
gabrielle
was
ignorant
of
coquetry
a
look
was
given
the
instant
it
was
asked
for
the
soft
rays
from
the
eyes
of
each
never
ceasing
to
mingle
unless
from
modesty
the
young
girl
took
the
joy
of
telling
etienne
what
pleasure
his
voice
gave
her
as
she
listened
to
his
song
she
forgot
the
meaning
of
his
words
when
he
explained
to
her
the
position
of
the
notes
or
their
value
she
listened
to
him
leaving
melody
for
the
instrument
the
idea
for
the
form
ingenuous
flattery
the
first
that
true
love
meets
gabrielle
thought
etienne
handsome
she
would
have
liked
to
stroke
the
velvet
of
his
mantle
to
touch
the
lace
of
his
broad
collar
as
for
etienne
he
was
transformed
under
the
creative
glance
of
those
earnest
eyes
they
infused
into
his
being
a
fruitful
sap
which
sparkled
in
his
eyes
shone
on
his
brow
remade
him
inwardly
so
that
he
did
not
suffer
from
this
new
play
of
his
faculties
on
the
contrary
they
were
strengthened
by
it
happiness
is
the
mother
s
milk
of
a
new
life
as
nothing
came
to
distract
them
from
each
other
they
stayed
together
not
only
this
day
but
all
days
for
they
belonged
to
one
another
from
the
first
hour
passing
the
sceptre
from
one
to
the
other
and
playing
with
themselves
as
children
play
with
life
sitting
happy
and
content
upon
the
golden
sands
they
told
each
other
their
past
painful
for
him
but
rich
in
dreams
dreamy
for
her
but
full
of
painful
pleasure
i
never
had
a
mother
said
gabrielle
but
my
father
has
been
good
as
god
i
never
had
a
father
said
the
hated
son
but
my
mother
was
all
of
heaven
to
etienne
related
his
youth
his
love
for
his
mother
his
taste
for
flowers
gabrielle
exclaimed
at
his
last
words
questioned
why
she
blushed
and
avoided
answering
then
when
a
shadow
passed
across
that
brow
which
death
seemed
to
graze
with
its
pinion
across
that
visible
soul
where
the
young
man
s
slightest
emotions
showed
she
answered
because
i
too
love
to
believe
ourselves
linked
far
back
in
the
past
by
community
of
tastes
is
not
that
a
declaration
of
love
such
as
virgins
know
how
to
give
love
desires
to
seem
old
it
is
a
coquetry
of
youth
etienne
brought
flowers
on
the
morrow
ordering
his
people
to
find
rare
ones
as
his
mother
had
done
in
earlier
days
for
him
who
knows
the
depths
to
which
the
roots
of
a
feeling
reach
in
the
soul
of
a
solitary
being
thus
returning
to
the
traditions
of
in
order
to
bestow
upon
a
woman
the
same
caressing
devotion
with
which
his
mother
had
charmed
his
life
to
him
what
grandeur
in
these
nothings
wherein
were
blended
his
only
two
affections
flowers
and
music
thus
became
the
language
of
their
love
gabrielle
replied
to
etienne
s
gifts
by
nosegays
of
her
own
nosegays
which
told
the
wise
old
doctor
that
his
ignorant
daughter
already
knew
enough
the
material
ignorance
of
these
two
lovers
was
like
a
dark
background
on
which
the
faintest
lines
of
their
intercourse
were
traced
with
exquisite
delicacy
like
the
red
pure
outlines
of
etruscan
figures
their
slightest
words
brought
a
flood
of
ideas
because
each
was
the
fruit
of
their
long
meditations
incapable
of
boldly
looking
forward
each
beginning
seemed
to
them
an
end
though
absolutely
free
they
were
imprisoned
in
their
own
simplicity
which
would
have
been
disheartening
had
either
given
a
meaning
to
their
confused
desires
they
were
poets
and
poem
both
music
the
most
sensual
of
arts
for
loving
souls
was
the
interpreter
of
their
ideas
they
took
delight
in
repeating
the
same
harmony
letting
their
passion
flow
through
those
fine
sheets
of
sound
in
which
their
souls
could
vibrate
without
obstacle
many
loves
proceed
through
opposition
through
struggles
and
reconciliations
the
vulgar
struggle
of
mind
and
matter
but
the
first
of
true
love
sends
it
far
beyond
such
struggles
where
all
is
of
the
same
essence
two
natures
are
no
longer
to
be
distinguished
like
genius
in
its
highest
expression
such
love
can
sustain
itself
in
the
brightest
light
it
grows
beneath
the
light
it
needs
no
shade
to
bring
it
into
relief
gabrielle
because
she
was
a
woman
etienne
because
he
had
suffered
much
and
meditated
much
passed
quickly
through
the
regions
occupied
by
common
passions
and
went
beyond
it
like
all
enfeebled
natures
they
were
quickly
penetrated
by
faith
by
that
celestial
glow
which
doubles
strength
by
doubling
the
soul
for
them
their
sun
was
always
at
its
meridian
soon
they
had
that
divine
belief
in
themselves
which
allows
of
neither
jealousy
nor
torment
abnegation
was
ever
ready
admiration
constant
under
these
conditions
love
could
have
no
pain
equal
in
their
feebleness
strong
in
their
union
if
the
noble
had
some
superiority
of
knowledge
and
some
conventional
grandeur
the
daughter
of
the
physician
eclipsed
all
that
by
her
beauty
by
the
loftiness
of
her
sentiments
by
the
delicacy
she
gave
to
their
enjoyments
thus
these
two
white
doves
flew
with
one
wing
beneath
their
pure
blue
heaven
etienne
loved
he
was
loved
the
present
was
serene
the
future
cloudless
he
was
sovereign
lord
the
castle
was
his
the
sea
belonged
to
both
of
them
no
vexing
thought
troubled
the
harmonious
concert
of
their
canticle
virginity
of
mind
and
senses
enlarged
for
them
the
world
their
thoughts
rose
in
their
minds
without
effort
desire
the
satisfactions
of
which
are
doomed
to
blast
so
much
desire
that
evil
of
terrestrial
love
had
not
as
yet
attacked
them
like
two
zephyrs
swaying
on
the
same
they
needed
nothing
more
than
the
joy
of
looking
at
each
other
in
the
mirror
of
the
limpid
waters
immensity
sufficed
them
they
admired
their
ocean
without
one
thought
of
gliding
on
it
in
the
bark
with
ropes
of
flowers
sailed
by
hope
love
has
its
moment
when
it
suffices
to
itself
when
it
is
happy
in
merely
being
during
this
springtime
when
all
is
budding
the
lover
sometimes
hides
from
the
beloved
woman
in
order
to
enjoy
her
more
to
see
her
better
but
etienne
and
gabrielle
plunged
together
into
all
the
delights
of
that
infantine
period
sometimes
they
were
two
sisters
in
the
grace
of
their
confidences
sometimes
two
brothers
in
the
boldness
of
their
questionings
usually
love
demands
a
slave
and
a
god
but
these
two
realized
the
dream
of
plato
they
were
but
one
being
deified
they
protected
each
other
caresses
came
slowly
one
by
one
but
chaste
as
the
merry
play
so
graceful
so
coquettish
of
young
animals
the
sentiment
which
induced
them
to
express
their
souls
in
song
led
them
to
love
by
the
manifold
transformations
of
the
same
happiness
their
joys
caused
them
neither
wakefulness
nor
delirium
it
was
the
infancy
of
pleasure
developing
within
them
unaware
of
the
beautiful
red
flowers
which
were
to
crown
its
shoots
they
gave
themselves
to
each
other
ignorant
of
all
danger
they
cast
their
whole
being
into
a
word
into
a
look
into
a
kiss
into
the
long
long
pressure
of
their
clasping
hands
they
praised
each
other
s
beauties
ingenuously
spending
treasures
of
language
on
these
secret
idylls
inventing
soft
exaggerations
and
more
diminutives
than
the
ancient
muse
of
tibullus
or
the
poesies
of
italy
on
their
lips
and
in
their
hearts
love
flowed
ever
like
the
liquid
fringes
of
the
sea
upon
the
sands
of
the
shore
all
alike
all
dissimilar
joyous
eternal
fidelity
if
we
must
count
by
days
the
time
thus
spent
was
five
months
only
if
we
may
count
by
the
innumerable
sensations
thoughts
dreams
glances
opening
flowers
realized
hopes
unceasing
joys
speeches
interrupted
renewed
abandoned
frolic
laughter
bare
feet
dabbling
in
the
sea
hunts
childlike
for
shells
kisses
surprises
clasping
hands
call
it
a
lifetime
death
will
justify
the
word
there
are
existences
that
are
ever
gloomy
lived
under
ashen
skies
but
suppose
a
glorious
day
when
the
sun
of
heaven
glows
in
the
azure
air
such
was
the
may
of
their
love
during
which
etienne
had
suspended
all
his
griefs
griefs
which
had
passed
into
the
heart
of
gabrielle
who
in
turn
had
fastened
all
her
joys
to
come
on
those
of
her
lord
etienne
had
had
but
one
sorrow
in
his
life
the
death
of
his
mother
he
was
to
have
but
one
love
gabrielle
chapter
vii
the
crushed
pearl
the
coarse
rivalry
of
an
ambitious
man
hastened
the
destruction
of
this
honeyed
life
the
duc
d
herouville
an
old
warrior
in
wiles
and
policy
had
no
sooner
passed
his
word
to
his
physician
than
he
was
conscious
of
the
voice
of
distrust
the
baron
d
artagnon
lieutenant
of
his
company
of
possessed
his
utmost
confidence
the
baron
was
a
man
after
the
duke
s
own
heart
a
species
of
butcher
built
for
strength
tall
virile
in
face
cold
and
harsh
brave
in
the
service
of
the
throne
rude
in
his
manners
with
an
iron
will
in
action
but
supple
in
manoeuvres
withal
an
ambitious
noble
possessing
the
honor
of
a
soldier
and
the
wiles
of
a
politician
he
had
the
hand
his
face
demanded
large
and
hairy
like
that
of
a
guerrilla
his
manners
were
brusque
his
speech
concise
the
duke
in
departing
gave
to
this
man
the
duty
of
watching
and
reporting
to
him
the
conduct
of
beauvouloir
toward
the
new
in
spite
of
the
secrecy
which
surrounded
gabrielle
it
was
difficult
to
long
deceive
the
commander
of
a
company
he
heard
the
singing
of
two
voices
he
saw
the
lights
at
night
in
the
dwelling
on
the
seashore
he
guessed
that
etienne
s
orders
repeated
constantly
for
flowers
concerned
a
woman
he
discovered
gabrielle
s
nurse
making
her
way
on
foot
to
forcalier
carrying
linen
or
clothes
and
bringing
back
with
her
the
and
other
articles
needed
by
a
young
lady
the
spy
then
watched
the
cottage
saw
the
physician
s
daughter
and
fell
in
love
with
her
beauvouloir
he
knew
was
rich
the
duke
would
be
furious
at
the
man
s
audacity
on
those
foundations
the
baron
d
artagnon
erected
the
edifice
of
his
fortunes
the
duke
on
learning
that
his
son
was
falling
in
love
would
of
course
instantly
endeavor
to
detach
him
from
the
girl
what
better
way
than
to
force
her
son
into
a
marriage
with
a
noble
like
himself
giving
his
son
to
the
daughter
of
some
great
house
the
heiress
of
large
estates
the
baron
himself
had
no
property
the
scheme
was
excellent
and
might
have
succeeded
with
other
natures
than
those
of
etienne
and
gabrielle
with
them
failure
was
certain
during
his
stay
in
paris
the
duke
had
avenged
the
death
of
maximilien
by
killing
his
son
s
adversary
and
he
had
planned
for
etienne
an
alliance
with
the
heiress
of
a
branch
of
the
house
of
grandlieu
a
tall
and
disdainful
beauty
who
was
flattered
by
the
prospect
of
some
day
bearing
the
title
of
duchesse
d
herouville
the
duke
expected
to
oblige
his
son
to
marry
her
on
learning
from
d
artagnon
that
etienne
was
in
love
with
the
daughter
of
a
miserable
physician
he
was
only
the
more
determined
to
carry
out
the
marriage
what
could
such
a
man
comprehend
of
love
he
who
had
let
his
own
wife
die
beside
him
without
understanding
a
single
sigh
of
her
heart
never
perhaps
in
his
life
had
he
felt
such
violent
anger
as
when
the
last
despatch
of
the
baron
told
him
with
what
rapidity
beauvouloir
s
plans
were
advancing
the
baron
attributing
them
wholly
to
the
bonesetter
s
ambition
the
duke
ordered
out
his
equipages
and
started
for
rouen
bringing
with
him
the
comtesse
de
grandlieu
her
sister
the
marquise
de
noirmoutier
and
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
under
pretext
of
showing
them
the
province
of
normandy
a
few
days
before
his
arrival
a
rumor
was
spread
about
the
country
by
what
means
no
one
seemed
to
know
of
the
passion
of
the
young
duc
de
nivron
for
gabrielle
beauvouloir
people
in
rouen
spoke
of
it
to
the
duc
d
herouville
in
the
midst
of
a
banquet
given
to
celebrate
his
return
to
the
province
for
the
guests
were
glad
to
deliver
a
blow
to
the
despot
of
normandy
this
announcement
excited
the
anger
of
the
governor
to
the
highest
pitch
he
wrote
to
the
baron
to
keep
his
coming
to
herouville
a
close
secret
giving
him
certain
orders
to
avert
what
he
considered
to
be
an
evil
it
was
under
these
circumstances
that
etienne
and
gabrielle
unrolled
their
thread
through
the
labyrinth
of
love
where
both
not
seeking
to
leave
it
thought
to
dwell
one
day
they
had
remained
from
morn
to
evening
near
the
window
where
so
many
events
had
taken
place
the
hours
filled
at
first
with
gentle
talk
had
ended
in
meditative
silence
they
began
to
feel
within
them
the
wish
for
complete
possession
and
presently
they
reached
the
point
of
confiding
to
each
other
their
confused
ideas
the
reflections
of
two
beautiful
pure
souls
during
these
still
serene
hours
etienne
s
eyes
would
sometimes
fill
with
tears
as
he
held
the
hand
of
gabrielle
to
his
lips
like
his
mother
but
at
this
moment
happier
in
his
love
than
she
had
been
in
hers
the
hated
son
looked
down
upon
the
sea
at
that
hour
golden
on
the
shore
black
on
the
horizon
and
slashed
here
and
there
with
those
silvery
caps
which
betoken
a
coming
storm
gabrielle
conforming
to
her
friend
s
action
looked
at
the
sight
and
was
silent
a
single
look
one
of
those
by
which
two
souls
support
each
other
sufficed
to
communicate
their
thoughts
each
loved
with
that
love
so
divinely
like
unto
itself
at
every
instant
of
its
eternity
that
it
is
not
conscious
of
devotion
or
sacrifice
or
exaction
it
fears
neither
deceptions
nor
delay
but
etienne
and
gabrielle
were
in
absolute
ignorance
of
satisfactions
a
desire
for
which
was
stirring
in
their
souls
when
the
first
faint
tints
of
twilight
drew
a
veil
athwart
the
sea
and
the
hush
was
interrupted
only
by
the
soughing
of
the
flux
and
reflux
on
the
shore
etienne
rose
gabrielle
followed
his
motion
with
a
vague
fear
for
he
had
dropped
her
hand
he
took
her
in
one
of
his
arms
pressing
her
to
him
with
a
movement
of
tender
cohesion
and
she
comprehending
his
desire
made
him
feel
the
weight
of
her
body
enough
to
give
him
the
certainty
that
she
was
all
his
but
not
enough
to
be
a
burden
on
him
the
lover
laid
his
head
heavily
on
the
shoulder
of
his
friend
his
lips
touched
the
heaving
bosom
his
hair
flowed
over
the
white
shoulders
and
caressed
her
throat
the
girl
ingenuously
loving
bent
her
head
aside
to
give
more
place
for
his
head
passing
her
arm
about
his
neck
to
gain
support
thus
they
remained
till
nightfall
without
uttering
a
word
the
crickets
sang
in
their
holes
and
the
lovers
listened
to
that
music
as
if
to
employ
their
senses
on
one
sense
only
certainly
they
could
only
in
that
hour
be
compared
to
angels
who
with
their
feet
on
earth
await
the
moment
to
take
flight
to
heaven
they
had
fulfilled
the
noble
dream
of
plato
s
mystic
genius
the
dream
of
all
who
seek
a
meaning
in
humanity
they
formed
but
one
soul
they
were
indeed
that
mysterious
pearl
destined
to
adorn
the
brow
of
a
star
as
yet
unknown
but
the
hope
of
all
will
you
take
me
home
said
gabrielle
the
first
to
break
the
exquisite
silence
why
should
we
part
replied
etienne
we
ought
to
be
together
always
she
said
stay
with
the
heavy
step
of
beauvouloir
sounded
in
the
adjoining
room
the
doctor
had
seen
these
children
at
the
window
locked
in
each
other
s
arms
but
he
found
them
separated
the
purest
love
demands
its
mystery
this
is
not
right
my
child
he
said
to
gabrielle
to
stay
so
late
and
have
no
why
wrong
she
said
you
know
we
love
each
other
and
he
is
master
of
the
my
children
said
beauvouloir
if
you
love
each
other
your
happiness
requires
that
you
should
marry
and
pass
your
lives
together
but
your
marriage
depends
on
the
will
of
monseigneur
the
duke
my
father
has
promised
to
gratify
all
my
wishes
cried
etienne
eagerly
interrupting
beauvouloir
write
to
him
monseigneur
replied
the
doctor
and
give
me
your
letter
that
i
may
enclose
it
with
one
which
i
myself
have
just
written
bertrand
is
to
start
at
once
and
put
these
despatches
into
monseigneur
s
own
hand
i
have
learned
that
he
is
now
in
rouen
he
has
brought
the
heiress
of
the
house
of
grandlieu
with
him
not
as
i
think
solely
for
himself
if
i
listened
to
my
presentiments
i
should
take
gabrielle
away
from
here
this
very
separate
us
cried
etienne
half
fainting
with
distress
and
leaning
on
his
love
father
gabrielle
said
the
physician
holding
out
to
her
a
which
he
took
from
a
table
signing
to
her
to
make
etienne
inhale
its
contents
gabrielle
my
knowledge
of
science
tells
me
that
nature
destined
you
for
each
other
i
meant
to
prepare
monseigneur
the
duke
for
a
marriage
which
will
certainly
offend
his
ideas
but
the
devil
has
already
prejudiced
him
against
it
etienne
is
duc
de
nivron
and
you
my
child
are
the
daughter
of
a
poor
my
father
swore
to
contradict
me
in
nothing
said
etienne
calmly
he
swore
to
me
also
to
consent
to
all
i
might
do
in
finding
you
a
wife
replied
the
doctor
but
suppose
that
he
does
not
keep
his
promises
etienne
sat
down
as
if
overcome
the
sea
was
dark
he
said
after
a
moment
s
silence
if
you
could
ride
a
horse
monseigneur
said
beauvouloir
i
should
tell
you
to
fly
with
gabrielle
this
very
evening
i
know
you
both
and
i
know
that
any
other
marriage
would
be
fatal
to
you
the
duke
would
certainly
fling
me
into
a
dungeon
and
leave
me
there
for
the
rest
of
my
days
when
he
heard
of
your
flight
and
i
should
die
joyfully
if
my
death
secured
your
happiness
but
alas
to
mount
a
horse
would
risk
your
life
and
that
of
gabrielle
we
must
face
your
father
s
anger
here
repeated
etienne
we
have
been
betrayed
by
some
one
in
the
chateau
who
has
stirred
your
father
s
wrath
against
us
continued
beauvouloir
let
us
throw
ourselves
together
into
the
sea
said
etienne
to
gabrielle
leaning
down
to
the
ear
of
the
young
girl
who
was
kneeling
beside
him
she
bowed
her
head
smiling
beauvouloir
divined
all
monseigneur
he
said
your
mind
and
your
knowledge
can
make
you
eloquent
and
the
force
of
your
love
may
be
irresistible
declare
it
to
monseigneur
the
duke
you
will
thus
confirm
my
letter
all
is
not
lost
i
think
i
love
my
daughter
as
well
as
you
love
her
and
i
shall
defend
etienne
shook
his
head
the
sea
was
very
dark
he
repeated
it
was
like
a
sheet
of
gold
at
our
feet
said
gabrielle
in
a
voice
of
melody
etienne
ordered
lights
and
sat
down
at
a
table
to
write
to
his
father
on
one
side
of
him
knelt
gabrielle
silent
watching
the
words
he
wrote
but
not
reading
them
she
read
all
on
etienne
s
forehead
on
his
other
side
stood
old
beauvouloir
whose
jovial
countenance
was
deeply
sad
sad
as
that
gloomy
chamber
where
etienne
s
mother
died
a
secret
voice
cried
to
the
doctor
the
fate
of
his
mother
awaits
him
when
the
letter
was
written
etienne
held
it
out
to
the
old
man
who
hastened
to
give
it
to
bertrand
the
old
retainer
s
horse
was
waiting
in
the
courtyard
saddled
the
man
himself
was
ready
he
started
and
met
the
duke
twelve
miles
from
herouville
come
with
me
to
the
gate
of
the
courtyard
said
gabrielle
to
her
friend
when
they
were
alone
the
pair
passed
through
the
cardinal
s
library
and
went
down
through
the
tower
in
which
was
a
door
the
key
of
which
etienne
had
given
to
gabrielle
stupefied
by
the
dread
of
coming
evil
the
poor
youth
left
in
the
tower
the
torch
he
had
brought
to
light
the
steps
of
his
beloved
and
continued
with
her
toward
the
cottage
a
few
steps
from
the
little
garden
which
formed
a
sort
of
flowery
courtyard
to
the
humble
habitation
the
lovers
stopped
emboldened
by
the
vague
alarm
which
oppressed
them
they
gave
each
other
in
the
shades
of
night
in
the
silence
that
first
kiss
in
which
the
senses
and
the
soul
unite
and
cause
a
revealing
joy
etienne
comprehended
love
in
its
dual
expression
and
gabrielle
fled
lest
she
should
be
drawn
by
that
love
whither
she
knew
not
at
the
moment
when
the
duc
de
nivron
reascended
the
staircase
to
the
castle
after
closing
the
door
of
the
tower
a
cry
of
horror
uttered
by
gabrielle
echoed
in
his
ears
with
the
sharpness
of
a
flash
of
lightning
which
burns
the
eyes
etienne
ran
through
the
apartments
of
the
chateau
down
the
grand
staircase
and
along
the
beach
towards
gabrielle
s
house
where
he
saw
lights
when
gabrielle
quitting
her
lover
had
entered
the
little
garden
she
saw
by
the
gleam
of
a
torch
which
lighted
her
nurse
s
the
figure
of
a
man
sitting
in
the
chair
of
that
excellent
woman
at
the
sound
of
her
steps
the
man
arose
and
came
toward
her
this
had
frightened
her
and
she
gave
the
cry
the
presence
and
aspect
of
the
baron
d
artagnon
amply
justified
the
fear
thus
inspired
in
the
young
girl
s
breast
are
you
the
daughter
of
beauvouloir
monseigneur
s
physician
asked
the
baron
when
gabrielle
s
first
alarm
had
subsided
yes
i
have
matters
of
the
utmost
importance
to
confide
to
you
i
am
the
baron
d
artagnon
lieutenant
of
the
company
of
commanded
by
monseigneur
the
duc
d
gabrielle
under
the
circumstances
in
which
she
and
her
lover
stood
was
struck
by
these
words
and
by
the
frank
tone
with
which
the
soldier
said
them
your
nurse
is
here
she
may
overhear
us
come
this
way
said
the
baron
he
left
the
garden
and
gabrielle
followed
him
to
the
beach
behind
the
house
fear
nothing
said
the
baron
that
speech
would
have
frightened
any
one
less
ignorant
than
gabrielle
but
a
simple
young
girl
who
loves
never
thinks
herself
in
peril
dear
child
said
the
baron
endeavoring
to
give
a
honeyed
tone
to
his
voice
you
and
your
father
are
on
the
verge
of
an
abyss
into
which
you
will
fall
i
can
not
see
your
danger
without
warning
you
monseigneur
is
furious
against
your
father
and
against
you
he
suspects
you
of
having
seduced
his
son
and
he
would
rather
see
him
dead
than
see
him
marry
you
so
much
for
his
son
as
for
your
father
this
is
the
decision
monseigneur
has
made
about
him
nine
years
ago
your
father
was
implicated
in
a
criminal
affair
the
matter
related
to
the
secretion
of
a
child
of
rank
at
the
time
of
its
birth
which
he
attended
monseigneur
knowing
that
your
father
was
innocent
guaranteed
him
from
prosecution
by
the
parliament
but
now
he
intends
to
have
him
arrested
and
delivered
up
to
justice
to
be
tried
for
the
crime
your
father
will
be
broken
on
the
wheel
though
perhaps
in
view
of
some
services
he
has
done
to
his
master
he
may
obtain
the
favor
of
being
hanged
i
do
not
know
what
course
monseigneur
has
decided
on
for
you
but
i
do
know
that
you
can
save
monseigneur
de
nivron
from
his
father
s
anger
and
your
father
from
the
horrible
death
which
awaits
him
and
also
save
what
must
i
do
said
gabrielle
throw
yourself
at
monseigneur
s
feet
and
tell
him
that
his
son
loves
you
against
your
will
and
say
that
you
do
not
love
him
in
proof
of
this
offer
to
marry
any
man
whom
the
duke
himself
may
select
as
your
husband
he
is
generous
he
will
dower
you
i
can
do
all
except
deny
my
but
if
that
alone
can
save
your
father
yourself
and
monseigneur
de
nivron
etienne
she
replied
would
die
of
it
and
so
should
monseigneur
de
nivron
will
be
unhappy
at
losing
you
but
he
will
live
for
the
honor
of
his
house
you
will
resign
yourself
to
be
the
wife
of
a
baron
only
instead
of
being
a
duchess
and
your
father
will
live
out
his
days
said
the
practical
man
at
this
moment
etienne
reached
the
house
he
did
not
see
gabrielle
and
he
uttered
a
piercing
cry
he
is
here
cried
the
young
girl
let
me
go
now
and
comfort
i
shall
come
for
your
answer
said
the
baron
i
will
consult
my
father
she
replied
you
will
not
see
him
again
i
have
received
orders
to
arrest
him
and
send
him
in
chains
under
escort
to
rouen
said
d
artagnon
leaving
gabrielle
dumb
with
terror
the
young
girl
sprang
to
the
house
and
found
etienne
horrified
by
the
silence
of
the
nurse
in
answer
to
his
question
where
is
she
i
am
here
cried
the
young
girl
whose
voice
was
icy
her
step
heavy
her
color
gone
what
has
happened
he
said
i
heard
you
yes
i
hurt
my
foot
against
no
love
replied
etienne
interrupting
her
i
heard
the
steps
of
a
etienne
we
must
have
offended
god
let
us
kneel
down
and
pray
i
will
tell
you
etienne
and
gabrielle
knelt
down
at
the
and
the
nurse
recited
her
rosary
o
god
prayed
the
girl
with
a
fervor
which
carried
her
beyond
terrestrial
space
if
we
have
not
sinned
against
thy
divine
commandments
if
we
have
not
offended
the
church
not
yet
the
king
we
who
are
one
and
the
same
being
in
whom
love
shines
with
the
light
that
thou
hast
given
to
the
pearl
of
the
sea
be
merciful
unto
us
and
let
us
not
be
parted
either
in
this
world
or
in
that
which
is
to
mother
added
etienne
who
art
in
heaven
obtain
from
the
virgin
that
if
we
can
not
gabrielle
and
i
be
happy
here
below
we
may
at
least
die
together
and
without
suffering
call
us
and
we
will
go
to
then
having
recited
their
evening
prayers
gabrielle
related
her
interview
with
baron
d
artagnon
gabrielle
said
the
young
man
gathering
strength
from
his
despair
i
shall
know
how
to
resist
my
he
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
but
not
again
upon
the
lips
then
he
returned
to
the
castle
resolved
to
face
the
terrible
man
who
had
weighed
so
fearfully
on
his
life
he
did
not
know
that
gabrielle
s
house
would
be
surrounded
and
guarded
by
soldiers
the
moment
that
he
quitted
it
the
next
day
he
was
struck
down
with
grief
when
on
going
to
see
her
he
found
her
a
prisoner
but
gabrielle
sent
her
nurse
to
tell
him
she
would
die
sooner
than
be
false
to
him
and
moreover
that
she
knew
a
way
to
deceive
the
guards
and
would
soon
take
refuge
in
the
cardinal
s
library
where
no
one
would
suspect
her
presence
though
she
did
not
as
yet
know
when
she
could
accomplish
it
etienne
on
that
returned
to
his
room
where
all
the
forces
of
his
heart
were
spent
in
the
dreadful
suspense
of
waiting
at
three
o
clock
on
the
afternoon
of
that
day
the
equipages
of
the
duke
and
suite
entered
the
courtyard
of
the
castle
madame
la
comtesse
de
grandlieu
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
daughter
the
duke
and
marquise
de
noirmoutier
mounted
the
grand
staircase
in
silence
for
the
stern
brow
of
the
master
had
awed
the
servants
though
baron
d
artagnon
now
knew
that
gabrielle
had
evaded
his
guards
he
assured
the
duke
she
was
a
prisoner
for
he
trembled
lest
his
own
private
scheme
should
fail
if
the
duke
were
angered
by
this
flight
those
two
terrible
faces
his
and
the
duke
s
wore
a
fierce
expression
that
was
by
an
air
of
gallantry
imposed
by
the
occasion
the
duke
had
already
sent
to
his
son
ordering
him
to
be
present
in
the
salon
when
the
company
entered
it
d
artagnon
saw
by
the
downcast
look
on
etienne
s
face
that
as
yet
he
did
not
know
of
gabrielle
s
escape
this
is
my
son
said
the
old
duke
taking
etienne
by
the
hand
and
presenting
him
to
the
ladies
etienne
bowed
without
uttering
a
word
the
countess
and
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
exchanged
a
look
which
the
old
man
intercepted
your
daughter
will
be
is
that
your
thought
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
think
quite
the
contrary
my
dear
duke
replied
the
mother
smiling
the
marquise
de
noirmoutier
who
accompanied
her
sister
laughed
significantly
that
laugh
stabbed
etienne
to
the
heart
already
the
sight
of
the
tall
lady
had
terrified
him
well
monsieur
le
duc
said
the
duke
in
a
low
voice
and
assuming
a
lively
air
have
i
not
found
you
a
handsome
wife
what
do
you
say
to
that
slip
of
a
girl
my
cherub
the
old
duke
never
doubted
his
son
s
obedience
etienne
to
him
was
the
son
of
his
mother
of
the
same
dough
docile
to
his
kneading
let
him
have
a
child
and
die
thought
the
old
man
little
i
father
said
the
young
man
in
a
gentle
voice
i
do
not
understand
come
into
your
own
room
i
have
a
few
words
to
say
to
you
replied
the
duke
leading
the
way
into
the
state
bedroom
etienne
followed
his
father
the
three
ladies
stirred
with
a
curiosity
that
was
shared
by
baron
d
artagnon
walked
about
the
great
salon
in
a
manner
to
group
themselves
finally
near
the
door
of
the
bedroom
which
the
duke
had
left
partially
open
dear
benjamin
said
the
duke
softening
his
voice
i
have
selected
that
tall
and
handsome
young
lady
as
your
wife
she
is
heiress
to
the
estates
of
the
younger
branch
of
the
house
of
grandlieu
a
fine
old
family
of
bretagne
therefore
make
yourself
agreeable
remember
all
the
you
have
read
of
in
your
books
and
learn
to
make
pretty
father
is
it
not
the
first
duty
of
a
nobleman
to
keep
his
word
well
then
on
the
day
when
i
forgave
you
the
death
of
my
mother
dying
here
through
her
marriage
with
you
did
you
not
promise
me
never
to
thwart
my
wishes
i
will
obey
you
as
the
family
god
were
the
words
you
said
to
me
i
ask
nothing
of
you
i
simply
demand
my
freedom
in
a
matter
which
concerns
my
life
and
myself
only
namely
my
i
understood
replied
the
old
man
all
the
blood
in
his
body
rushing
into
his
face
that
you
would
not
oppose
the
continuation
of
our
noble
you
made
no
condition
said
etienne
i
do
not
know
what
love
has
to
do
with
race
but
this
i
know
i
love
the
daughter
of
your
old
friend
beauvouloir
and
the
granddaughter
of
your
friend
la
belle
she
is
dead
replied
the
old
colossus
with
an
air
both
savage
and
jeering
which
told
only
too
plainly
his
intention
of
making
away
with
her
a
moment
of
deep
silence
followed
the
duke
saw
through
the
door
the
three
ladies
and
d
artagnon
at
that
crucial
moment
etienne
whose
sense
of
hearing
was
acute
heard
in
the
cardinal
s
library
poor
gabrielle
s
voice
singing
to
let
her
lover
know
she
was
there
ermine
hath
not
her
pureness
the
lily
not
her
the
hated
son
whom
his
father
s
horrible
speech
had
flung
into
a
gulf
of
death
returned
to
the
surface
of
life
at
the
sound
of
that
voice
though
the
emotion
of
terror
thus
rapidly
cast
off
had
already
in
that
instant
broken
his
heart
he
gathered
up
his
strength
looked
his
father
in
the
face
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
gave
scorn
for
scorn
and
said
in
tones
of
hatred
a
nobleman
ought
not
to
then
with
one
bound
he
sprang
to
the
door
of
the
library
and
cried
gabrielle
suddenly
the
gentle
creature
appeared
among
the
shadows
like
the
lily
among
its
leaves
trembling
before
those
mocking
women
thus
informed
of
etienne
s
love
as
the
clouds
that
bear
the
thunder
project
upon
the
heavens
so
the
old
duke
reaching
a
degree
of
anger
that
defies
description
stood
out
upon
the
brilliant
background
produced
by
the
rich
clothing
of
those
courtly
dames
between
the
destruction
of
his
son
and
a
mesalliance
every
other
father
would
have
hesitated
but
in
this
uncontrollable
old
man
ferocity
was
the
power
which
had
so
far
solved
the
difficulties
of
life
for
him
he
drew
his
sword
in
all
cases
as
the
only
remedy
that
he
knew
for
the
gordian
knots
of
life
under
present
circumstances
when
the
convulsion
of
his
ideas
had
reached
its
height
the
nature
of
the
man
came
uppermost
twice
detected
in
flagrant
falsehood
by
the
being
he
abhorred
the
son
he
cursed
cursing
him
more
than
ever
in
this
supreme
moment
when
that
son
s
despised
and
to
him
most
despicable
weakness
triumphed
over
his
own
omnipotence
infallible
till
then
the
father
and
the
man
ceased
to
exist
the
tiger
issued
from
its
lair
casting
at
the
angels
before
him
the
sweetest
pair
that
ever
set
their
feet
on
earth
a
murderous
look
of
hatred
die
then
both
of
you
he
cried
you
vile
abortion
the
proof
of
my
shame
and
you
he
said
to
gabrielle
miserable
strumpet
with
the
viper
tongue
who
has
poisoned
my
these
words
struck
home
to
the
hearts
of
the
two
children
the
terror
that
already
surcharged
them
at
the
moment
when
etienne
saw
the
huge
hand
of
his
father
raising
a
weapon
upon
gabrielle
he
died
and
gabrielle
fell
dead
in
striving
to
retain
him
the
old
man
left
them
and
closed
the
door
violently
saying
to
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
i
will
marry
you
myself
you
are
young
and
gallant
enough
to
have
a
fine
new
lineage
whispered
the
countess
in
the
ear
of
the
old
man
who
had
served
under
seven
kings
of
france
