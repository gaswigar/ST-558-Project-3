i
revelation
must
religion
and
morals
go
together
can
one
be
taught
without
the
other
it
is
a
practical
question
for
educationists
and
france
tried
to
answer
it
in
the
dreariest
little
cut
and
dry
kind
of
catechism
ever
given
to
boys
to
make
them
long
to
be
wicked
but
apart
from
education
the
question
of
the
bedrock
on
which
morals
rest
the
foundation
on
which
a
moral
edifice
can
be
built
that
will
stand
secure
against
the
storms
of
life
that
is
a
question
of
perennial
interest
and
it
must
be
answered
by
each
of
us
if
we
would
have
a
test
of
right
and
wrong
would
know
why
right
is
right
why
wrong
is
wrong
religions
based
on
revelation
find
in
revelation
their
basis
for
morality
and
for
them
that
is
right
which
the
giver
of
the
revelation
commands
and
that
is
wrong
which
he
forbids
right
is
right
because
god
or
a
hi
or
a
prophet
commands
it
and
right
rests
on
the
will
of
a
lawgiver
authoritatively
revealed
in
a
scripture
now
all
revelation
has
two
great
disadvantages
as
a
basis
for
morality
it
is
fixed
and
therefore
unprogressive
while
man
evolves
and
at
a
later
stage
of
his
growth
the
morality
taught
in
the
revelation
becomes
archaic
and
unsuitable
a
written
book
can
not
change
and
many
things
in
the
bibles
of
religion
come
to
be
out
of
date
inappropriate
to
new
circumstances
and
even
shocking
to
an
age
in
which
conscience
has
become
more
enlightened
than
it
was
of
old
the
fact
that
in
the
same
revelation
as
that
in
which
palpably
immoral
commands
appear
there
occur
also
jewels
of
fairest
radiance
gems
of
poetry
pearls
of
truth
helps
us
not
at
all
if
moral
teachings
worthy
only
of
savages
occur
in
scriptures
containing
also
rare
and
precious
precepts
of
purest
sweetness
the
juxtaposition
of
light
and
darkness
only
produces
moral
chaos
we
can
not
here
appeal
to
reason
or
judgment
for
both
must
be
silent
before
authority
both
rest
on
the
same
ground
thus
saith
the
lord
precludes
all
argument
let
us
take
two
widely
accepted
scriptures
both
regarded
as
authoritative
by
the
respective
religions
which
accept
them
as
coming
from
a
divine
preceptor
or
through
a
human
but
illuminated
being
moses
in
the
one
case
manu
in
the
other
i
am
of
course
well
aware
that
in
both
cases
we
have
to
do
with
books
which
may
contain
traditions
of
their
great
authors
even
sentences
transmitted
down
the
centuries
the
unravelling
of
the
tangled
threads
woven
into
such
books
is
a
work
needing
the
highest
scholarship
and
an
infinite
patience
few
of
us
are
equipped
for
such
labour
but
let
us
ignore
the
work
of
the
higher
criticism
and
take
the
books
as
they
stand
and
the
objection
raised
to
them
as
a
basis
for
morality
will
at
once
appear
thus
we
read
in
the
same
book
thou
shalt
not
avenge
nor
bear
any
grudge
against
the
children
of
thy
people
but
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
the
stranger
that
dwelleth
with
you
shall
be
unto
you
as
one
born
among
you
and
thou
shalt
love
him
as
thyself
for
ye
were
strangers
in
the
land
of
egypt
sanctify
yourselves
therefore
and
be
ye
holy
scores
of
noble
passages
inculcating
high
morality
might
be
quoted
but
we
have
also
if
thy
brother
the
son
of
thy
mother
or
thy
son
or
thy
daughter
or
the
wife
of
thy
bosom
or
thy
friend
which
is
as
thine
own
soul
entice
thee
secretly
saying
let
us
go
and
serve
other
gods
thou
shalt
not
consent
unto
him
nor
hearken
unto
him
neither
shalt
thine
eye
pity
him
neither
shalt
thou
spare
neither
shalt
thou
conceal
him
but
thou
shalt
surely
kill
him
thine
hand
shall
be
first
upon
him
to
put
him
to
death
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
a
man
is
told
that
he
may
seize
a
fair
woman
in
war
and
be
her
husband
and
she
shall
be
thy
wife
and
it
shall
be
that
if
thou
hast
no
delight
in
her
then
thou
shalt
let
her
go
whither
she
will
these
teachings
and
many
others
like
them
have
drenched
europe
with
blood
and
scorched
it
with
fire
men
have
grown
out
of
them
they
no
longer
heed
nor
obey
them
for
man
reason
performs
its
eclectic
work
on
revelation
chooses
the
good
rejects
the
evil
this
is
very
good
but
it
destroys
revelation
as
a
basis
christians
have
outgrown
the
lower
part
of
their
revelation
and
do
not
realise
that
in
striving
to
explain
it
away
they
put
the
axe
to
the
root
of
its
authority
so
also
is
it
with
the
institutes
of
manu
to
take
but
one
example
from
the
great
sacred
literature
of
india
there
are
precepts
of
the
noblest
order
and
the
essence
and
relative
nature
of
morality
is
philosophically
set
out
the
sacred
law
is
thus
grounded
on
the
rule
of
conduct
and
he
declares
that
good
conduct
is
the
root
of
further
growth
in
spirituality
apart
from
questions
of
general
morality
to
which
we
shall
need
to
refer
hereafter
let
us
take
the
varying
views
of
women
as
laid
down
in
the
present
sm
i
as
accepted
on
many
points
there
is
no
wiser
guide
than
parts
of
this
sm
i
as
will
be
seen
in
chapter
iv
with
regard
to
the
marriage
law
manu
says
let
mutual
fidelity
continue
unto
death
of
a
father
he
declares
no
father
who
knows
must
take
even
the
smallest
gratuity
for
his
daughter
for
a
man
who
through
avarice
takes
a
gratuity
is
a
seller
of
his
offspring
of
the
home
he
says
women
must
be
honoured
and
adorned
by
their
fathers
husbands
brothers
and
who
desire
happiness
where
women
are
honoured
there
the
evas
are
pleased
but
where
they
are
not
honoured
any
sacred
rite
is
fruitless
in
that
family
where
the
husband
is
pleased
with
his
wife
and
the
wife
with
her
husband
note
the
equality
happiness
will
assuredly
be
lasting
food
is
to
be
given
first
in
a
house
to
women
to
infants
to
the
sick
and
to
pregnant
women
yet
the
same
manu
is
supposed
to
have
taken
the
lowest
and
coarsest
view
of
women
it
is
the
nature
of
women
to
seduce
men
for
that
reason
the
wise
are
never
unguarded
with
females
one
should
not
sit
in
a
lonely
place
with
one
mother
sister
or
daughter
for
the
senses
are
powerful
and
master
even
a
learned
man
a
woman
must
never
act
independently
even
in
her
own
house
she
must
be
subject
to
father
husband
or
on
her
husband
death
sons
women
have
allotted
to
them
as
qualities
impure
desires
wrath
dishonesty
malice
and
bad
conduct
the
sh
ra
servant
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
younger
son
a
slave
is
to
be
looked
on
as
one
shadow
and
if
a
man
is
offended
by
him
he
must
bear
it
without
resentment
yet
the
most
ghastly
punishments
are
ordered
to
be
inflicted
on
sh
ras
for
intruding
on
certain
sacred
rites
the
net
result
is
that
ancient
revelations
being
given
for
a
certain
age
and
certain
social
conditions
often
can
not
and
ought
not
to
be
carried
out
in
the
present
state
of
society
that
ancient
documents
are
difficult
to
verify
often
impossible
as
coming
from
those
whose
names
they
bear
that
there
is
no
guarantee
against
forgeries
interpolations
glosses
becoming
part
of
the
text
with
a
score
of
other
imperfections
that
they
contain
contradictions
and
often
absurdities
to
say
nothing
of
immoralities
ultimately
every
revelation
must
be
brought
to
the
bar
of
reason
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
so
brought
in
practice
even
the
most
orthodox
br
hma
a
in
hin
ism
disregarding
all
the
sh
s
raic
injunctions
which
he
finds
to
be
impracticable
or
even
inconvenient
while
he
uses
those
which
suit
him
to
condemn
his
unorthodox
neighbours
no
revelation
is
accepted
as
fully
binding
in
any
ancient
religion
but
by
common
consent
the
inconvenient
parts
are
quietly
dropped
and
the
evil
parts
repudiated
revelation
as
a
basis
for
morality
is
impossible
but
all
sacred
books
contain
much
that
is
pure
lofty
inspiring
belonging
to
the
highest
morality
the
true
utterances
of
the
sages
and
saints
of
mankind
these
precepts
will
be
regarded
with
reverence
by
the
wise
and
should
be
used
as
authoritative
teaching
for
the
young
and
the
uninstructed
as
moral
textbooks
like
textbooks
in
other
sciences
and
as
containing
moral
truths
some
of
which
can
be
verified
by
all
morally
advanced
persons
and
others
verifiable
only
by
those
who
reach
the
level
of
the
original
teachers
ii
intuition
when
scholarship
reason
and
conscience
have
made
impossible
the
acceptance
of
revelation
as
the
bedrock
of
morality
the
student
especially
in
the
west
is
apt
next
to
test
intuition
as
a
probable
basis
for
ethics
in
the
east
this
idea
has
not
appealed
to
the
thinker
in
the
sense
in
which
the
word
intuition
is
used
in
the
west
the
moralist
in
the
east
has
based
ethics
on
revelation
or
on
evolution
or
on
illumination
the
last
being
the
basis
of
the
mystic
intuition
which
by
moralists
like
theodore
parker
frances
power
cobb
and
many
theists
is
spoken
of
as
the
voice
of
god
in
the
human
soul
is
identified
by
these
with
conscience
so
that
to
base
morality
on
intuition
is
equivalent
to
basing
it
on
conscience
and
making
the
dictate
of
conscience
the
categorical
imperative
the
inner
voice
which
declares
authoritatively
thou
shalt
or
thou
shalt
not
now
it
is
true
that
for
each
individual
there
is
no
better
no
safer
guide
than
his
own
conscience
and
that
when
the
moralist
says
to
the
inquirer
obey
your
conscience
he
is
giving
him
sound
ethical
advice
none
the
less
is
the
thinker
faced
with
an
apparently
insuperable
difficulty
in
the
way
of
accepting
conscience
as
an
ethical
basis
for
he
finds
the
voice
of
conscience
varying
with
civilisation
education
race
religion
traditions
customs
and
if
it
be
indeed
the
voice
of
god
in
man
he
can
not
but
see
in
a
sense
quite
different
from
that
intended
by
the
writer
that
god
in
divers
manners
spoke
in
past
times
moreover
he
observes
as
an
historical
fact
that
some
of
the
worst
crimes
which
have
disgraced
humanity
have
been
done
in
obedience
to
the
voice
of
conscience
it
is
quite
clear
that
cromwell
at
drogheda
was
obeying
conscience
was
doing
that
which
he
conscientiously
believed
to
be
the
will
of
god
and
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
a
man
like
torquemada
was
also
carrying
out
what
he
conscientiously
believed
to
be
the
divine
will
in
the
war
which
he
waged
against
heresy
through
the
inquisition
in
this
moral
chaos
with
such
a
clash
of
discordant
divine
voices
where
shall
sure
guidance
be
found
one
recalls
the
bitter
gibe
of
laud
to
the
puritan
who
urged
that
he
must
follow
his
conscience
yea
verily
but
take
heed
that
thy
conscience
be
not
the
conscience
of
a
fool
conscience
speaks
with
authority
whenever
it
speaks
at
all
its
voice
is
imperial
strong
and
clear
none
the
less
is
it
often
uninformed
mistaken
in
its
dictate
there
an
intuition
which
is
verily
the
voice
of
the
spirit
in
man
in
the
man
which
is
dealt
with
in
the
fifth
chapter
but
the
intuition
recognised
in
the
west
and
identified
with
conscience
is
something
far
other
for
the
sake
of
clarity
we
must
define
what
conscience
is
since
we
have
said
what
it
is
not
that
it
is
not
the
voice
of
the
spirit
in
man
that
it
is
not
the
voice
of
god
conscience
is
the
result
of
the
accumulated
experience
gained
by
each
man
in
his
previous
lives
each
of
us
is
an
immortal
spirit
a
divine
fragment
a
self
a
fragment
of
mine
own
self
transformed
in
the
world
of
life
into
an
immortal
spirit
draweth
round
itself
the
senses
of
which
the
mind
is
the
sixth
veiled
in
matter
such
is
each
man
he
evolves
into
manifested
powers
all
the
potentialities
unfolded
in
him
by
virtue
of
his
divine
parentage
and
this
is
effected
by
repeated
births
into
this
world
wherein
he
gathers
experience
repeated
deaths
out
of
this
world
into
the
other
twain
the
wheel
of
births
and
deaths
turns
in
the
riloka
the
three
worlds
wherein
he
reaps
in
pain
the
results
of
experiences
gathered
by
disregard
of
law
and
assimilates
transforming
into
faculty
moral
and
mental
the
results
of
experience
gathered
in
harmony
with
law
having
transmuted
experience
into
faculty
he
returns
to
earth
for
the
gathering
of
new
experience
dealt
with
as
before
after
physical
death
thus
the
spirit
unfolds
or
the
man
evolves
whichever
expression
is
preferred
to
indicate
this
growth
very
similarly
doth
the
physical
body
grow
a
man
eats
food
digests
it
assimilates
it
transmutes
it
into
the
materials
of
his
body
ill
food
causes
pain
even
disease
good
food
strengthens
and
makes
for
growth
the
outer
is
a
reflection
of
the
inner
now
conscience
is
the
sum
total
of
the
experiences
in
past
lives
which
have
borne
sweet
and
bitter
fruit
according
as
they
were
in
accord
or
disaccord
with
surrounding
natural
law
this
sum
total
of
experiences
which
result
in
increased
or
diminished
life
we
call
instinct
and
it
is
the
sum
total
of
our
interwoven
and
experiences
in
our
relations
with
others
is
moral
instinct
or
conscience
and
it
is
harmonising
impels
to
good
a
word
which
we
shall
define
in
our
fourth
chapter
hence
conscience
depends
on
the
experiences
through
which
we
have
passed
in
previous
lives
and
is
necessarily
an
individual
possession
it
differs
where
the
past
experience
is
different
as
in
the
savage
and
the
civilised
man
the
dolt
and
the
talented
the
fool
and
the
genius
the
criminal
and
the
saint
the
voice
of
god
would
speak
alike
in
all
the
experience
of
the
past
speaks
differently
in
each
hence
also
the
consciences
of
men
at
a
similar
evolutionary
level
speak
alike
on
broad
questions
of
right
and
wrong
good
and
evil
on
these
the
voice
is
clear
but
there
are
many
questions
whereon
past
experience
fails
us
and
then
conscience
fails
to
speak
we
are
in
doubt
two
apparent
duties
conflict
two
ways
seem
equally
right
or
equally
wrong
i
do
not
know
what
i
to
do
says
the
perplexed
moralist
hearing
no
inner
voice
in
such
cases
we
must
seek
to
form
the
best
judgment
we
can
and
then
act
boldly
if
unknowingly
we
disregard
some
hidden
law
we
shall
suffer
and
experience
will
be
added
to
our
sum
total
and
in
similar
circumstances
in
the
future
conscience
through
the
aid
of
this
added
experience
will
have
found
a
voice
hence
we
may
ever
having
judged
as
best
we
can
act
boldly
and
learn
increased
wisdom
from
the
result
much
moral
cowardice
paralysing
action
has
resulted
from
the
christian
idea
of
sin
as
something
that
incurs
the
wrath
of
god
and
that
needs
to
be
forgiven
in
order
to
escape
an
artificial
not
a
natural
penalty
we
gain
knowledge
by
experience
and
disregard
of
a
law
where
it
is
not
known
should
cause
us
no
distress
no
remorse
no
repentance
only
a
quiet
mental
note
that
we
must
in
future
remember
the
law
which
we
disregarded
and
make
our
conduct
harmonise
therewith
where
conscience
does
not
speak
how
shall
we
act
the
way
is
well
known
to
all
thoughtful
people
we
first
try
to
eliminate
all
personal
desire
from
the
consideration
of
the
subject
on
which
decision
is
needed
so
that
the
mental
atmosphere
may
not
be
rendered
a
distorting
medium
by
the
mists
of
personal
pleasure
or
pain
next
we
place
before
us
all
the
circumstances
giving
each
its
due
weight
then
we
decide
the
next
step
depends
on
whether
we
believe
in
higher
powers
or
not
if
we
do
we
sit
down
quietly
and
alone
we
place
our
decision
before
us
we
suspend
thought
but
remain
mentally
alert
all
mental
ear
as
it
were
we
ask
for
help
from
god
from
our
teacher
from
our
own
higher
self
into
that
silence
comes
the
decision
we
obey
it
without
further
consideration
and
then
we
watch
the
result
and
judge
by
that
of
the
value
of
the
decision
for
it
may
have
come
from
the
higher
or
from
the
lower
self
but
as
we
did
our
very
best
we
feel
no
trouble
even
if
the
decision
should
be
wrong
and
bring
us
pain
we
have
gained
an
experience
and
will
do
better
next
time
the
trouble
the
pain
we
have
brought
on
ourselves
by
our
ignorance
we
note
as
showing
that
we
have
disregarded
a
law
and
we
profit
by
the
additional
knowledge
in
the
future
thus
understanding
conscience
we
shall
not
take
it
as
a
basis
of
morality
but
as
our
best
available
individual
light
we
shall
judge
our
conscience
educate
it
evolve
it
by
mental
effort
by
careful
observation
as
we
learn
more
our
conscience
will
develop
as
we
act
up
to
the
highest
we
can
see
our
vision
will
become
ever
clearer
and
our
ear
more
sensitive
as
muscles
develop
by
exercise
so
conscience
develops
by
activity
and
as
we
use
our
lamp
it
burns
the
more
brightly
but
let
it
ever
be
remembered
that
it
is
a
man
own
experience
that
must
guide
him
and
his
own
conscience
that
must
decide
to
overrule
the
conscience
of
another
is
to
induce
in
him
moral
paralysis
and
to
seek
to
dominate
the
will
of
another
is
a
crime
iii
utility
to
those
whose
intelligence
and
conscience
had
revolted
against
the
crude
and
immoral
maxims
mixed
up
with
noble
precepts
in
revelation
to
those
who
recognised
the
impossibility
of
accepting
the
varying
voices
of
intuition
as
a
moral
guide
to
all
those
the
theory
that
morality
was
based
on
utility
came
as
a
welcome
and
rational
relief
it
promised
a
scientific
certitude
to
moral
precepts
it
left
the
intellect
free
to
inquire
and
to
challenge
it
threw
man
back
on
grounds
which
were
found
in
this
world
alone
and
could
be
tested
by
reason
and
experience
it
derived
no
authority
from
antiquity
no
sanction
from
religion
it
stood
entirely
on
its
own
feet
independently
of
the
many
conflicting
elements
which
were
found
in
the
religions
of
the
past
and
present
the
basis
for
morality
according
to
utility
is
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
that
which
conduces
to
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
is
right
that
which
does
not
is
wrong
this
general
maxim
being
laid
down
it
remains
for
the
student
to
study
history
to
analyse
experience
and
by
a
close
and
careful
investigation
into
human
nature
and
human
relations
to
elaborate
a
moral
code
which
would
bring
about
general
happiness
and
this
so
far
has
not
been
done
utility
has
been
a
moral
basis
and
certain
rough
rules
of
conduct
have
grown
up
by
experience
and
the
necessities
of
life
without
any
definite
investigation
into
or
codifying
of
experience
man
moral
basis
as
a
rule
is
a
compound
of
partially
accepted
revelations
and
partially
admitted
consciences
with
a
practical
application
of
the
principle
of
that
which
works
best
the
majority
are
not
philosophers
and
care
little
for
a
logical
basis
they
are
unconscious
empirics
and
their
morality
is
empirical
charles
bradlaugh
considering
that
the
maxim
did
not
sufficiently
guard
the
interests
of
the
minority
and
that
so
far
as
was
possible
these
also
should
be
considered
and
guarded
added
another
phrase
his
basis
ran
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
with
the
least
injury
to
any
the
rule
was
certainly
improved
by
the
addition
but
it
did
not
remove
many
of
the
objections
raised
it
was
urged
by
the
utilitarian
that
morality
had
developed
out
of
the
social
side
of
human
beings
that
men
as
social
animals
desired
to
live
in
permanent
relations
with
each
other
and
that
this
resulted
in
the
formation
of
families
men
could
not
be
happy
in
solitude
the
persistence
of
these
groups
amid
the
conflicting
interests
of
the
individuals
who
composed
them
could
only
be
secured
by
recognising
that
the
interests
of
the
majority
must
prevail
and
form
the
rule
of
conduct
for
the
whole
family
morality
it
was
pointed
out
thus
began
in
family
relations
and
conduct
which
disrupted
the
family
was
wrong
while
that
which
strengthened
and
consolidated
it
was
right
thus
family
morality
was
established
as
families
congregated
together
for
mutual
protection
and
support
their
separate
interests
as
families
were
found
to
be
conflicting
and
so
a
was
sought
in
the
same
principle
which
governed
relations
within
the
family
the
common
interests
of
the
grouped
families
the
tribe
must
prevail
over
the
separate
and
conflicting
interests
of
the
separate
families
that
which
disrupted
the
tribe
was
wrong
while
that
which
strengthened
and
consolidated
it
was
right
thus
tribal
morality
was
established
the
next
step
was
taken
as
tribes
grouped
themselves
together
and
became
a
nation
and
morality
extended
so
as
to
include
all
who
were
within
the
nation
that
which
disrupted
the
nation
was
wrong
and
that
which
consolidated
and
strengthened
it
was
right
thus
national
morality
was
established
further
than
that
utilitarian
morality
has
not
progressed
and
international
relations
have
not
yet
been
moralised
they
remain
in
the
savage
state
and
recognise
no
moral
law
germany
has
boldly
accepted
this
position
and
declares
formally
that
for
the
state
might
is
right
and
that
all
which
the
state
can
do
for
its
own
aggrandisement
for
the
increase
of
its
power
it
may
and
ought
to
do
for
there
is
no
rule
of
conduct
to
which
it
owes
obedience
it
is
a
law
unto
itself
other
nations
have
not
formularised
the
statement
in
their
literature
as
germany
has
done
but
the
strong
nations
have
acted
upon
it
in
their
dealings
with
the
weaker
nations
although
the
dawning
sense
of
an
international
morality
in
the
better
of
them
has
led
to
the
defence
of
international
wrong
by
the
tyrant
plea
necessity
the
most
flagrant
instance
of
the
utter
disregard
of
right
and
wrong
as
between
nations
is
perhaps
the
action
of
the
allied
european
nations
against
china
in
which
the
hun
theory
of
frightfulness
was
enunciated
by
the
german
kaiser
but
the
history
of
nations
so
far
is
a
history
of
continual
tramplings
on
the
weak
by
the
strong
and
with
the
coming
to
the
front
of
the
christian
white
nations
and
their
growth
in
scientific
knowledge
and
thereby
in
power
the
coloured
nations
and
tribes
whether
civilised
or
savage
have
been
continually
exploited
and
oppressed
international
morality
at
present
does
not
exist
murder
within
the
family
the
tribe
and
the
nation
is
marked
as
a
crime
save
that
judicial
murder
capital
punishment
is
permitted
on
the
principle
of
supposed
utility
but
multiple
murder
outside
the
nation
war
is
not
regarded
as
criminal
nor
is
theft
wrong
when
committed
by
a
strong
nation
on
a
weak
one
it
may
be
that
out
of
the
widespread
misery
caused
by
the
present
war
some
international
morality
may
be
developed
we
may
admit
that
as
a
matter
of
historical
and
present
fact
utility
has
been
everywhere
tacitly
accepted
as
the
basis
of
morality
defective
as
it
is
as
a
theory
utility
is
used
as
the
test
of
revelation
as
the
test
of
intuition
and
precepts
of
manu
zarathushtra
moses
christ
muhammad
are
acted
on
or
disregarded
according
as
they
are
considered
to
be
useful
or
harmful
or
impracticable
to
be
suitable
or
unsuitable
to
the
times
inconsistencies
in
these
matters
do
not
trouble
the
practical
ordinary
man
the
chief
attack
on
the
theory
of
utility
as
a
basis
for
morality
has
come
from
christians
and
has
been
effected
by
challenging
the
word
happiness
as
the
equivalent
of
pleasure
the
greatest
number
as
equivalent
to
individual
and
then
denouncing
the
maxim
as
a
morality
for
swine
virtue
is
placed
in
antagonism
to
happiness
and
virtue
not
happiness
is
said
to
be
the
right
aim
for
man
this
really
begs
the
question
for
what
is
virtue
the
crux
of
the
whole
matter
lies
there
is
virtue
opposed
to
happiness
or
is
it
a
means
to
happiness
why
is
the
word
pleasure
substituted
for
happiness
when
utility
is
attacked
we
may
take
the
second
question
first
pleasure
in
ordinary
parlance
means
an
immediate
and
transitory
form
of
happiness
and
usually
a
happiness
of
the
body
rather
than
of
the
emotions
and
the
mind
hence
the
swine
a
sensual
enjoyment
is
a
pleasure
union
with
god
would
not
be
called
a
pleasure
but
happiness
an
old
definition
of
man
true
object
is
to
know
god
and
to
enjoy
him
for
ever
there
happiness
is
clearly
made
the
true
end
of
man
the
assailant
changes
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
into
the
pleasure
of
the
individual
and
having
created
this
man
of
straw
he
triumphantly
knocks
it
down
does
not
virtue
lead
to
happiness
is
it
not
a
condition
of
happiness
how
does
the
christian
define
virtue
it
is
obedience
to
the
will
of
god
but
he
only
obeys
that
will
as
revealed
so
far
as
it
agrees
with
utility
he
no
longer
slays
the
heretic
and
he
suffers
the
witch
to
live
he
does
not
give
his
cloak
to
the
thief
who
has
stolen
his
coat
but
he
hands
over
the
thief
to
the
policeman
moreover
as
herbert
spencer
pointed
out
he
follows
virtue
as
leading
to
heaven
if
right
conduct
led
him
to
everlasting
torture
would
he
still
pursue
it
or
would
he
revise
his
idea
of
right
conduct
the
martyr
dies
for
the
truth
he
sees
because
it
is
easier
to
die
than
to
betray
truth
he
could
not
live
on
happily
as
a
conscious
liar
the
nobility
of
a
man
character
is
tested
by
the
things
which
give
him
pleasure
the
joy
in
following
truth
in
striving
after
the
noblest
he
can
see
that
is
the
greatest
happiness
to
sacrifice
present
enjoyment
for
the
service
of
others
is
not
but
to
the
spirit
who
is
man
where
utility
fails
is
that
it
does
not
inspire
save
where
the
spiritual
life
is
already
seen
to
be
the
highest
happiness
of
the
individual
because
it
conduces
to
the
good
of
all
not
only
of
the
greatest
number
men
who
thus
feel
have
inspiration
from
within
themselves
and
need
no
outside
moral
code
no
compelling
external
law
ordinary
men
the
huge
majority
at
the
present
stage
of
evolution
need
either
compulsion
or
inspiration
otherwise
they
will
not
control
their
animal
nature
they
will
not
sacrifice
an
immediate
pleasure
to
a
permanent
increase
of
happiness
they
will
not
sacrifice
personal
gain
to
the
common
good
the
least
developed
of
these
are
almost
entirely
influenced
by
fear
of
personal
pain
and
wish
for
personal
pleasure
they
will
not
put
their
hand
into
the
fire
because
they
know
that
fire
burns
and
no
one
accuses
them
of
a
low
motive
because
they
do
not
burn
themselves
religion
shows
them
that
the
results
of
the
disregard
of
moral
and
mental
law
work
out
in
suffering
after
death
as
well
as
before
it
and
that
the
results
of
obedience
to
such
laws
similarly
work
out
in
pleasure
it
thus
supplies
a
useful
element
in
the
early
stages
of
moral
development
at
a
higher
stage
love
of
god
and
the
wish
to
please
him
by
leading
an
exemplary
life
is
a
motive
offered
by
religion
and
this
inspires
to
purity
and
to
again
this
is
no
more
ignoble
than
the
wish
to
please
the
father
the
mother
the
friend
many
a
lad
keeps
pure
to
please
his
mother
because
he
loves
her
so
religious
men
try
to
live
nobly
to
please
god
because
they
love
him
at
a
higher
stage
yet
the
good
of
the
people
the
good
of
the
race
of
humanity
in
the
future
acts
as
a
potent
inspiration
but
this
does
not
touch
the
selfish
lower
types
hence
utility
fails
as
a
compelling
power
with
the
majority
and
is
insufficient
as
motive
add
to
this
the
radical
fault
that
it
does
not
place
morality
on
a
universal
basis
the
happiness
of
that
it
disregards
the
happiness
of
the
minority
and
its
unsatisfactory
nature
is
seen
it
has
much
of
truth
in
it
it
enters
as
a
determining
factor
into
all
systems
of
ethics
even
where
nominally
ignored
or
directly
rejected
it
is
a
better
basis
in
theory
though
a
worse
one
in
practice
than
either
revelation
or
intuition
but
it
is
incomplete
we
must
seek
further
for
a
solid
basis
of
morality
iv
evolution
we
come
now
to
the
sure
basis
of
morality
the
bedrock
of
nature
whereon
morality
may
be
built
beyond
all
shaking
and
change
built
as
a
science
with
recognised
laws
and
in
a
form
intelligible
and
capable
of
indefinite
expansion
evolution
is
recognised
as
the
method
of
nature
her
method
in
all
her
realms
and
according
to
the
ascertained
laws
of
nature
so
far
as
they
are
known
all
wise
and
thoughtful
people
endeavour
to
guide
themselves
in
making
morality
a
science
we
give
it
a
binding
force
and
render
it
of
universal
application
moreover
we
incorporate
into
it
all
the
fragments
of
truth
which
exist
in
other
systems
and
which
have
lent
to
them
their
authority
their
appeal
to
the
intellect
and
the
heart
let
us
first
define
morality
it
is
the
science
of
human
relations
the
science
of
conduct
and
its
laws
as
inviolable
as
sure
as
changeless
as
all
other
laws
of
nature
can
be
discovered
and
formulated
harmony
with
these
laws
like
harmony
with
all
other
natural
laws
is
the
condition
of
happiness
for
in
a
realm
of
law
none
can
move
without
pain
while
disregarding
law
a
law
of
nature
is
the
statement
of
an
inviolable
and
constant
sequence
external
to
ourselves
and
unchangeable
by
our
will
and
amid
the
conditions
of
these
inviolable
sequences
we
live
from
these
we
can
not
escape
one
choice
alone
is
ours
to
live
in
harmony
with
them
or
to
disregard
them
violate
them
we
can
not
but
we
can
dash
ourselves
against
them
then
the
law
asserts
itself
in
the
suffering
that
results
from
our
flinging
ourselves
against
it
or
from
our
disregarding
its
existence
its
existence
is
proved
as
well
by
the
pain
that
results
from
our
disregard
of
it
as
by
the
pleasure
that
results
from
our
harmony
with
it
only
a
fool
deliberately
and
gratuitously
disregards
a
natural
law
when
he
knows
of
its
existence
a
man
shapes
his
conduct
so
as
to
avoid
the
pain
which
results
from
clashing
with
it
unless
he
deliberately
disregards
the
pain
in
view
of
a
result
to
be
brought
about
which
he
considers
to
be
worth
more
than
the
purchase
price
of
pain
the
science
of
morality
of
right
conduct
lays
down
the
conditions
of
harmonious
relations
between
individuals
and
their
several
environments
small
or
large
families
societies
nations
humanity
as
a
whole
only
by
the
knowledge
and
observance
of
these
laws
can
men
be
either
permanently
healthy
or
permanently
happy
can
they
live
in
peace
and
prosperity
where
morality
is
unknown
or
disregarded
friction
inevitably
arises
disharmony
and
pain
result
for
nature
is
a
settled
order
in
the
mental
and
moral
worlds
as
much
as
in
the
physical
and
only
by
knowledge
of
that
order
and
by
obedience
to
it
can
harmony
health
and
happiness
be
secured
the
religious
man
sees
in
the
laws
of
nature
the
manifestation
of
the
divine
nature
and
in
obedience
to
and
with
them
he
sees
obedience
to
and
with
the
will
of
god
the
man
sees
them
as
sequences
he
can
not
alter
on
harmony
with
which
his
happiness
his
comfort
depends
in
either
case
they
have
a
binding
force
the
man
belonging
to
any
exoteric
religion
will
modify
by
them
the
precepts
of
his
scriptures
realising
that
morality
rises
as
evolution
proceeds
he
does
thus
modify
scriptural
precepts
by
practical
obedience
or
disregard
whether
he
do
it
by
theory
or
not
but
it
is
better

therefore
be

in

of
a

temporary

entailed
by
it
we
shall
see
under
mysticism
the
moment
we
base
morality
on
evolution
we
see
that
it
must
change
with
the
stage
of
evolution
reached
and
that
the
duty
that
which
ought
to
be
done
of
the
civilised
and
highly
advanced
man
is
not
the
same
as
the
duty
of

if
morality
be
based
on
evolution
we
can
at
once
define
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
that
is
right
which
subserves
evolution
that
is
wrong
which
antagonises
it
or
in
other
words
for
those
of
us
who
believe
that
god
method
for
this
world
is
the
evolutionary
that
is
right
which
with
his
will
that
is
wrong
which
works
against
it

is
an
attempt
to
state
this
at
any
given
time
intuition
is
the
result
of
successful
attempts
to
do
this
utility
is
the
application
of
observed
results
of
happiness
and
misery
which
flow
from
obedience
to
this
or
disregard
thereof
evolution
is
the
unfolding
and
manifestation
of
the
unfolding
of
the
capacities
of
consciousness
the
manifestation
of
these
capacities
in
and
more
plastic
forms
the
primary
truth
of
morality
as
of
religion
and
of
science
is
the
unity
of
life
one
life
ever
unfolding
in
endless
varieties
of
forms
the
essence
of
all
beings
is
the
same
the
inequalities
are
the
marks
of
the
stage
of
its
unfoldment
when
we
base
morality
on
evolution
we
can
not
have
it
is
obvious
one
cut
and
dry
rule
for
all
those
who
want
cut
and
dry
rules
must
go
to
their
scriptures
for
them
and
even
then
as
the
rules
in
the
scriptures
are
contradictory
both
as
between
scriptures
and
within
any
given
scripture
they
must
call
in
the
help
of
intuition
and
utility
in
the
making
of
their
code
in
their
selective
process
this
selective
process
will
be
largely
moulded
by
the
public
opinion
of
their
country
and
age
emphasising
some
precepts
and
ignoring
others
and
the
code
will
be
the
expression
of
the
average
morality
of
the
time
if
this
clumsy
and
uncertain
fashion
of
finding
a
rule
of
conduct
does
not
suit
us
we
must
be
willing
to
exert
our
intelligence
to
take
a
large
view
of
the
evolutionary
process
and
to
deduce
our
moral
precepts
at
any
given
stage
by
applying
our
reason
to
the
scrutiny
of
this
process
at
that
stage
this
scrutiny
is
a
laborious
one
but
truth
is
the
prize
of
effort
in
the
search
therefor
it
is
not
an
unearned
gift
to
the
slothful
and
the
careless
this
large
view
of
the
evolutionary
process
shows
us
that
it
is
best
studied
in
two
great
divisions
the
first
from
the
savage
to
the
highly
civilised
man
who
is
still
working
primarily
for
himself
and
his
family
still
working
for
private
ends
predominantly
and
the
second
at
present
but
sparsely
followed
in
which
the
man
realising
the
supreme
claim
of
the
whole
upon
its
part
seeks
the
public
good
predominantly
renounces
individual
advantages
and
private
gains
and
consecrates
himself
to
the
service
of
god
and
of
man
the
hindu
calls
the
first
section
of
evolution
the
prav
i
m
rga
the
path
of
forthgoing
the
second
the
niv
i
m
rga
the
path
of
return
in
the
first
the
man
evolves
by
taking
in
the
second
by
giving
in
the
first
he
incurs
debts
in
the
second
he
pays
them
in
the
first
he
acquires
in
the
second
he
renounces
in
the
first
he
lives
for
the
profit
of
the
smaller
self
in
the
second
for
the
service
of
the
one
self
in
the
first
he
claims
rights
in
the
second
he
discharges
duties
thus
morality
is
seen
from
two
and
the
virtues
it
comprises
fall
into
two
groups
men
are
surrounded
on
every
side
by
objects
of
desire
and
the
use
of
these
is
to
evoke
the
desire
to
possess
them
to
stimulate
exertion
to
inspire
efforts
and
thus
to
make
faculty
capacity
strength
intelligence
alertness
judgment
perseverance
patience
fortitude
those
who
regard
the
world
as
and
must
inevitably
realise
that
the
relation
of
man
susceptible
to
pleasure
and
pain
by
contact
with
his
environment
to
his
environment
filled
with
pleasure
and
objects
must
be
intended
to
provoke
in
man
the
desire
to
possess
the
to
avoid
the
in
fact
god
lures
to
exertion
are
pleasures
his
warnings
are
pains
and
the
interplay
between
man
and
environment
causes
evolution
the
man
who
does
not
believe
in
god
has
only
to
substitute
the
word
nature
for
god
and
to
leave
out
the
idea
of
design
and
the
argument
remains
the
same
man
relation
to
his
environment
provokes
exertion
and
thus
evolution
a
man
on
the
path
of
forthgoing
will
at
first
seize
everything
he
desires
careless
of
others
and
will
gradually
learn
from
the
attacks
of
the
despoiled
some
respect
for
the
rights
of
others
the
lesson
will
be
learnt
more
quickly
by
the
teaching
of
more
advanced
men
his
founders
of
religions
sages
and
the
like
who
tell
him
that
if
he
kills
robs
tramples
on
others
he
will
suffer
he
does
all
these
things
he
suffers
he
learns
his
lives
helping
him
much
in
the
learning
later
on
he
lives
a
more
controlled
and
regulated
life
and
he
may
blamelessly
enjoy
the
objects
of
desire
provided
he
injure
none
in
the
taking
hin
ism
lays
down
as
the
proper
pursuits
for
the
household
life
the
gaining
of
wealth
the
performance
of
the
duties
of
the
position
held
the
gratification
of
desire
the
desires
will
become
subtler
and
more
refined
as
intelligence
fashions
them
and
as
emotions
replace
passions
but
throughout
the
treading
of
the
path
of
forthgoing
the
desire
for
fruit
is
the
necessary
and
blameless
motive
for
exertion
without
this
the
man
at
this
stage
of
evolution
becomes
lethargic
and
does
not
evolve
desire
subserves
evolution
and
it
is
right
the
gratification
of
desire
may
lead
a
man
to
do
injury
to
others
and
as
soon
as
he
has
developed
enough
to
understand
this
then
the
gratification
becomes
wrong
because
forgetting
the
unity
he
has
inflicted
harm
on
one
who
shares
life
with
him
and
has
thus
hampered
evolution
the
sense
of
unity
is
the
the
uniter
and
love
is
the
expression
of
the
attraction
of
the
separated
towards
union
out
of
love
controlled
by
reason
and
by
the
desire
for
the
happiness
of
all
grow
all
virtues
which
are
but
permanent
universal
specialised
of
love
so
also
is
the
sense
of
separateness
the
the
divider
the
expression
of
the
repulsion
of
the
separated
from
each
other
out
of
this
grow
all
vices
the
permanent
universal
specialised
of
hate
that
which
love
does
for
the
beloved
that
virtue
does
for
all
who
need
its
aid
so
far
as
its
power
extends
that
which
hate
wreaks
on
the
abhorred
that
vice
does
to
all
who
obstruct
its
path
so
far
as
its
power
extends
virtues
and
vices
are
fixed
emotional
states
the
virtues
are
fixed
regulated
and
controlled
by
enlightened
intelligence

the
unity
the
vices
are

and

by
the
unenlightened

text
ii
it
is
obvious
that
virtues
are
constructive
and
vices
destructive
for
love
holds
together
while
hate
disintegrates
yet
the
modified
form
of
hate
antagonism
competition
had
its
part
to
play
in
the
earlier
stages
of
human
evolution
developing
strength
courage
and
endurance
and
while
love
built
up
nations
within
themselves
hate
made
each
strong
against
its
competitor
and
within
nations
there
has
been
conflict
of
classes
class
and
caste
war
and
all
this
modified
and
softened
by
a
growing
sense
of
a
common
good
until
competition
the
characteristic
of
the
path
of
forthgoing
tends
to
change
into
the
characteristic
of
the
path
of
return
the
path
of
forthgoing
must
still
be
trodden
by
many
but
the
number
is
decreasing
more
and
more
are
turning
towards
the
path
of
return
ideals
are
formulated
by
the
leaders
of
humanity
and
the
ideals
held
up
are
increasingly
those
of
love
and
of
service
during
the
first
stage
man
grasps
at
everything
he
desires
and
develops
a
strong
individuality
by
conflict
in
the
second
he
shares
all
he
has
and
yokes
that
individuality
to
service
separation
is
the
of
the
one
unity
is
the
of
the
other
hence
we
need
not
brand
as
evil
the
rough
aggression
and
the
fierce
struggles
of
barbarous
times
they
were
a
necessary
stage
of
growth
and
were
at
that
stage
right
and
in
the
divine
plan
but
now
those
days
are
over
strength
has
been
won
the
time
has
come
when
the
separated
selves
must
gradually
draw
together
and
to
with
the
divine
will
which
is
working
for
union
is
the
right
the
right
which
is
the
outcome
of
love
directed
by
reason
at
the
present
stage
of
evolution
then
seeks
an
realisation
of
unity
a
drawing
together
of
the
separated
selves
that
which
by
establishing
harmonious
relations
makes
for
unity
is
right
that
which
divides
and
disintegrates
which
makes
for
separation
is
wrong
hin
ism
on
which
the
whole
of
this
is
based
has
added
to
this
broad
criterion
the
division
of
a
life
into
four
stages
to
each
of
which
appropriate
virtues
are
assigned
the
student
period
with
its
virtues
of
perfect
continence
industry
frugality
exertion
the
household
period
with
its
virtue
of
duties
appropriate
to
the
position
the
earning
and
enjoying
of
wealth
the
gratification
of
desires
the
retirement
period
with
the
virtues
of
the
renouncing
of
worldly
gain
and
of
sacrifice
the
ascetic
period
of
complete
renunciation
meditation
and
preparation
for
life
these
indications
make
more
easy
the
decisions
as
to
right
and
wrong
the
more
we
think
upon
and
work
out
into
detail
this
view
of
morality
as
based
on
evolution
the
more
we
realise
its
soundness
and
the
more
we
find
that
the
moral
law
is
as
discoverable
by
observation
by
reason
and
by
experiment
as
any
other
law
of
nature
if
a
man
disregards
it
either
ignorantly
or
wilfully
he
suffers
a
man
may
disregard
physical
hygienic
and
sanitary
laws
because
of
his
ignorance
none
the
less
will
he
suffer
from
physical
disease
a
man
may
disregard
moral
laws
because
of
ignorance
none
the
less
will
he
suffer
from
moral
disease
the
sign
of
disease
in
both
cases
is
pain
and
unhappiness
experts
in
both
cases
warn
us
and
if
we
disregard
the
warning
we
learn
its
truth
later
by
experience
there
is
no
hurry
but
the
law
is
sure
working
with
the
law
man
evolves
swiftly
with
happiness
working
against
it
he
evolves
slowly
with
pain
in
either
case
he
evolves
advancing
joyously
as
a
free
man
or
scourged
onwards
as
a
slave
the
most
obstinate
fool
in
life
class
refusing
to
learn
fortunately
dies
and
can
not
quite
escape
after
death
the
knowledge
of
his
folly
let
the
reader
try
for
himself
the
solution
of
moral
problems
accepting
as
a
hypothesis
the
facts
of
evolution
and
of
the
two
halves
of
its
huge
spiral
and
see
for
himself
if
this
view
does
not
offer
a
rational
intelligible
practical
meaning
to
the
words
right
and
wrong
let
him
see
how
it
embraces
all
that
is
true
in
the
other
bases
suggested
is
their
summation
and
rationalises
their
precepts
he
will
find
that
morality
is
no
longer
dependent
on
the
maxims
of
great
teachers
though
indeed
they
proclaimed
its
changeless
laws
nor
on
the
imperfect
resultant
of
individual
experiences
nor
on
the
happiness
of
some
only
of
the
great
human
family
but
that
it
inheres
in
the
very
nature
of
things
an
essential
law
of
happy
life
and
ordered
progress
then
indeed
is
morality
founded
on
a
basis
that
can
not
be
moved
then
indeed
can
it
speak
with
an
imperial
authority
the
ought
that
must
be
obeyed
then
it
unfolds
its
beauty
as
humanity
evolves
to
its
perfecting
and
leads
to
bliss
eternal
the
brahman
bliss
where
the
human
will
in
fullest
freedom
accords
itself
in
harmony
with
the
divine
v
mysticism
mysticism
can
not
be
spoken
of
as
a
basis
of
morality
in
the
sense
in
which
revelation
intuition
utility
and
evolution
are
bases
for
it
is
valid
only
for
the
individual
not
for
everybody
for
the
true
mystic
the
dictates
of
the
outer
or
inner
god
are
imperial
compelling
but
to
any
one
else
they
are
entirely
unauthoritative
none
the
less
as
the
influence
of
the
mystic
is
and
his
dicta
are
accepted
by
many
as
a
trustworthy
revelation
are
not
all
revelations
communicated
by
mystics
or
as
the
intuition
of
an
illuminated
conscience
or
as
showing
the
highest
utility
or
as
the
result
of
an
evolution
higher
than
the
normal
it
is
worth
while
to
consider
their
value
mysticism
is
the
realisation
of
god
of
the
universal
self
it
is
attained
either
as
a
realisation
of
god
outside
the
mystic
or
within
himself
in
the
first
case
it
is
usually
reached
from
within
a
religion
by
exceptionally
intense
love
and
devotion
accompanied
by
purity
of
life
for
only
the
pure
in
heart

a
the
lord
jesus
long
continued
and
persevering
and
the
devotee
realises
his
divinity
by
ecstacy
attaining
union
thereby
such
mystics
are
for
the
most
part
valuable
to
the
world
as
creating
an
atmosphere
of
spirituality
which
raises
the
general
level
of
religious
feeling
in
those
who
come
within
its
area
india
has
especially
profited
by
the
considerable
number
of
such
mystics
found
within
its
borders
in
past
times
and
to
a
lesser
extent
every
one
who
practises
for
instance
meditation
knows
that
it
is
easier
here
than
elsewhere
and
all
sensitive
persons
feel
the
indian
atmosphere
outside

such
mystics
occasionally
write
valuable
books
containing
high
ideals
of
the
spiritual
life
as
a
rule
they
do
not
concern
themselves
with
the
affairs
of
the
outer
world
which
they
regard
as
unimportant
their
cry
continually
is
that
the
world
is
evil
and
they
call
on
men
to
leave
it
not
to
improve
it
to
them
god
and
the
world
are
in
opposition
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
are
the
three
great
enemies
of
the
spiritual
life
in
the
west
this
is
almost
universal
for
in
the
roman
catholic
church
seclusion
is
the
mark
of
the
religious
life
and
the
religious
are
the
monk
and
the
nun
the
religious
and
the
secular
being
in
opposition
in
truth
where
the
realisation
of
god
outside
himself
is
sought
by
the
devotee
seclusion
is
a
necessity
for
success
if
only
for
the
time
which
is
required
for
meditation
the
essential
preliminary
of
ecstacy
in
the
very
rare
mystics
of
communions
full
ecstacy
is
scarcely
if
at
all
known
or
even
recognised
an
overpowering
sense
of
the
divine
presence
is
experienced
but
it
is
a
presence
outside
the
worshipper
it
is
accompanied
with
a
deliberate
surrender
of
the
will
to
god
and
a
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
man
that
he
becomes
an
instrument
of
the
divine
will
this
he
carries
with
him
into
outer
life
and
undirected
by
love
and
the
illuminated
reason
it
often
lands
the
mystic
into
fanaticism
and
cruelty
no
one
who
has
read
oliver
cromwell
letters
can
deny
that
he
was
a
mystic
and
it
is
on
him
that
lord
rosebery
founded
his
dictum
of
the
formidable
nature
of
the
practical
mystic
the
ever
present
sense
of
a
divine
power
behind
himself
gives
such
a
man
a
power
that
ordinary
men
can
not
successfully
oppose
but
this
sense
affords
no
moral
basis
as
witness
the
massacre
of
drogheda
such
a
mystic
belonging
to
a
particular
religion
as
he
always
does
takes
the
revelation
of
his
religion
as
his
moral
code
and
cromwell
felt
himself
as
the
avenging
sword
of
his
god
as
did
the
hebrews
fighting
with
the
amalekites
no
man
who
accepts
a
revelation
as
his
guide
can
be
regarded
as
more
than
partially
a
mystic
he
has
the
mystic
temperament
only
and
that
undoubtedly
gives
him
a
strength
far
beyond
the
strength
of
those
who
have
it
not
the
true
mystic
realising
god
has
no
need
of
any
scriptures
for
he
has
touched
the
source
whence
all
scriptures
flow
an
enlightened

has
no
more
need
of
the
ve
as
than
a
man
needs
a
tank
in
a
place
which
is
overflowing
with
water
the
value
of
cisterns
of
reservoirs
is
past
when
a
man
is
seated
beside
an
spring
as
dean
inge
has
pointed
out
mysticism
is
the
most
scientific
form
of
religion
for
it
bases
itself
as
does
all
science
on
experience
and
experiment
experiment
being
only
a
specialised
form
of
experience
devised
either
to
discover
or
to
verify
we
have
seen
the
mystic
who
realises
god
outside
himself
and
seeks
union
with
him
there
remains
the
most
interesting
the
most
effective
form
of
mysticism
the
realisation
by
a
man
of
god
within
himself
here
meditation
is
also
a
necessity
and
the
man
who
is
born
with
a
high
capacity
for
concentration
is
merely
a
man
who
has
practised
it
in
previous
lives
a
life
or
lives
of
study
and
seclusion
often
precede
a
life
of
tremendous
and
sustained
activity
in
the
physical
world
the
realisation
is
preceded
by
control
of
the
body
control
of
the
emotions
and
control
of
the
mind
for
the
power
to
hold
these
in
complete
stillness
is
necessary
if
a
man
is
to
penetrate
into
those
depths
of
his
own
nature
in
which
alone
is
to
be
found
the
shrine
of
the
inner
god
the
subtle
music
of
that
sphere
is
drowned
by
the
clatter
of
the
lower
bodies
as
the
most
exquisite
notes
of
the
v
are
lost
in
the
crude
harsh
sound
of
the
harmonium
the
voice
of
the
silence
can
only
be
heard
in
the
silence
and
all
the
desires
of
the
heart
must
be
paralysed
ere
can
arise
in
the
tranquillity
of
senses
and
mind
the
glorious
majesty
of
the
self
only
in
the
desert
of
loneliness
rises
that
sun
in
all
his
glory
for
all
objects
that
might
cloud
his
dawning
must
vanish
only
when
go
does
god
arise
even
the
outer
god
must
hide
ere
the
inner
god
can
manifest
the
cry
of
agony
of
the
crucified
must
be
wrung
from
the
tortured
lips
my
god
my
god
why
hast
forsaken
me
precedes
the
realisation
of
the
god
within
through
this
all
mystics
pass
who
are
needed
for
great
service
in
the
world
those
whom
bagshot
so
acutely
calls
materialised
mystics
the
mystics
who
find
god
outside
themselves
are
the
unmaterialised
mystics
and
they
serve
the
world
in
the
ways
above
mentioned
but
the
other
as
bagshot
points
out
transmute
their
mystic
thought
into
practical
energy
and
these
become
the
most
formidable
powers
known
in
the
physical
world
all
that
is
based
on
injustice
fraud
and
wrong
may
well
tremble
when
one
of
these
arises
for
the
hidden
god
has
become
manifest
and
who
may
bar
his
way
such
mystics
wear
none
of
the
outer
signs
of
the
religious
their
renunciation
is
within
not
without
there
is
no
parade
of
outer
holiness
no
outer
separation

the
world

of

only
the

of
how
much
these
foolish
ones
need
their
help
and
how
should
these
foolish
ones
hurt
those
on
whom
the
peace
of
the
eternal
abides
these
mystics
are
a
law
unto
themselves
for
the
inner
law
has
replaced
the
external
compulsion
more
rigid
for
it
is
the
law
of
their
own
nature
more
compelling

it

it

in

but
it
has
it
ought
to
have
no
authority
outside
the
mystic
himself
it
may
persuade
it
may
win
it
may
inspire
but
it
may
not
claim
obedience
as
of
right
for
the
voice
of
the
god
within
only
becomes
authoritative
for
another
when
the
god
within
that
other
self
answers
the
mystic
appeal
and
he
recognises
an
ideal
that
he
could
not
have
formulated
unaided
for
himself
the
mystic
may
shine
as
a
light
but
a
man
must
see
with
his
own
eyes
and
there
lies
the
world
