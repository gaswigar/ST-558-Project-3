later
than
you
think
by
fritz
leiber
it
much
later
the
question
is
how
late
transcriber
note
this
etext
was
produced
from
galaxy
science
fiction
october
extensive
research
did
not
uncover
any
evidence
that
the
copyright
on
this
publication
was
renewed
obviously
the
archeologist
study
belonged
to
an
era
vastly
distant
from
today
familiar
similarities
here
and
there
only
sharpened
the
feeling
of
alienage
the
sunlight
that
filtered
through
the
windows
in
the
ceiling
had
a
wan
and
greenish
cast
and
was
augmented
by
radiation
from
some
luminous
material
impregnating
the
walls
and
floor
even
the
wide
desk
and
the
commodious
hassocks
glowed
with
a
restful
light
across
the
former
were
scattered
wax
tablets
styluses
and
a
pair
of
large
and
oddly
formed
spectacles
the
crammed
bookcases
were
not
particularly
unusual
but
the
books
were
bound
in
metal
and
the
script
on
their
spines
would
have
been
utterly
unfamiliar
to
the
most
erudite
of
modern
linguists
one
of
the
books
lying
open
on
a
hassock
showed
leaves
of
a
thin
flexible
rustless
metal
covered
with
luminous
characters
between
the
bookcases
were
phosphorescent
oil
paintings
mainly
of
sea
bottoms
in
somber
greens
and
browns
their
style
neither
wholly
realistic
nor
abstract
would
have
baffled
the
historian
of
art
a
blackboard
with
large
colored
crayons
hinted
equally
at
the
schoolroom
and
the
studio
in
the
center
of
the
room
midway
to
the
ceiling
hung
a
fish
with
irridescent
scales
of
breathtaking
beauty
so
invisible
was
its
means
of
support
that
also
taking
into
account
the
strange
paintings
and
the
greenish
light
one
would
have
sworn
that
the
object
was
to
create
an
underwater
scene
the
explorer
made
his
entrance
in
a
theatrical
swirl
of
movement
he
embraced
the
archeologist
with
a
warmth
calculated
to
startle
that
crusty
old
fellow
then
he
settled
himself
on
a
hassock
looked
up
and
asked
a
question
in
a
speech
and
idiom
so
different
from
any
we
know
that
it
must
be
called
another
means
of
communication
rather
than
another
language
the
import
was
well
what
about
it
if
the
archeologist
were
taken
aback
he
concealed
it
his
expression
showed
only
pleasure
at
being
reunited
with
a
friend
what
about
what
he
queried
about
your
discovery
what
discovery
the
archeologist
incomprehension
was
playful
the
explorer
threw
up
his
arms
why
what
else
but
your
discovery
here
on
earth
of
the
remains
of
an
intelligent
species
it
the
find
of
the
age
am
i
going
to
have
to
coax
you
out
with
it
i
did
make
the
discovery
the
other
said
tranquilly
i
only
supervised
the
excavations
and
directed
the
correlation
of
material
ought
to
be
doing
the
talking
the
one
who
just
returned
from
the
stars
forget
that
the
explorer
brushed
the
question
aside
as
soon
as
our
spaceship
got
within
radio
range
of
earth
they
started
to
send
us
a
continuous
newscast
covering
the
period
of
our
absence
one
of
the
items
exasperatingly
brief
mentioned
your
discovery
it
captured
my
imagination
i
could
wait
to
hear
the
details
he
paused
then
confessed
you
get
so
eager
out
there
in
space
a
droplet
of
life
lost
in
immensity
you
rediscover
your
emotions
he
changed
color
then
finished
rapidly
as
soon
as
i
could
decently
get
away
i
came
straight
to
you
i
wanted
to
hear
about
it
from
the
best
authority
yourself
the
archeologist
regarded
him
quizzically
i
pleased
that
you
should
think
of
me
and
my
work
and
i
very
happy
to
see
you
again
but
admit
it
now
is
there
something
a
bit
odd
about
your
getting
so
worked
up
over
this
thing
i
can
understand
that
after
your
long
absence
from
earth
any
news
of
earth
would
seem
especially
important
but
there
an
additional
reason
the
explorer
twisted
impatiently
oh
i
suppose
there
is
disappointment
for
one
thing
we
were
hoping
to
get
in
touch
with
intelligent
life
out
there
we
were
specially
trained
in
techniques
for
establishing
mental
contact
with
alien
intelligent
life
forms
well
we
found
some
planets
with
life
upon
them
all
right
but
it
was
primitive
life
not
worth
bothering
about
again
he
hesitated
embarrassedly
out
there
you
get
to
thinking
of
the
preciousness
of
intelligence
there
so
little
of
it
and
it
so
lonely
and
we
so
greatly
need
intercourse
with
another
intelligent
species
to
give
depth
and
balance
to
our
thoughts
i
suppose
i
set
too
much
store
by
my
hopes
of
establishing
a
contact
he
paused
at
any
rate
when
i
heard
that
what
we
were
looking
for
you
had
found
here
at
home
even
though
dead
and
done
for
i
felt
that
at
least
it
was
something
i
was
suddenly
very
eager
it
is
odd
i
know
to
get
so
worked
up
about
an
extinct
species
as
if
my
interest
could
mean
anything
to
them
now
but
that
the
way
it
hit
me
several
small
shadows
crossed
the
windows
overhead
they
might
have
been
birds
except
they
moved
too
slowly
i
think
i
understand
the
archeologist
said
softly
so
get
on
with
it
and
tell
me
about
your
discovery
the
explorer
exploded
i
already
told
you
that
it
was
my
discovery
the
archeologist
reminded
him
a
few
years
after
your
expedition
left
there
was
begun
a
detailed
resurvey
of
earth
mineral
resources
in
the
course
of
some
deep
continental
borings
one
party
discovered
a
cache
either
a
very
large
box
or
a
rather
small
room
with
metallic
walls
of
great
strength
and
toughness
evidently
its
makers
had
intended
it
for
the
very
purpose
of
carrying
a
message
down
through
the
ages
it
proved
to
contain
artifacts
models
of
buildings
vehicles
and
machines
objects
of
art
pictures
and
books
hundreds
of
books
along
with
elaborate
pictorial
dictionaries
for
interpreting
them
so
now
we
even
understand
their
languages
languages
interrupted
the
explorer
that
queer
somehow
one
thinks
of
an
alien
species
as
having
just
one
language
like
our
own
this
species
had
several
though
there
were
some
words
and
symbols
that
were
alike
in
all
their
languages
these
words
and
symbols
seem
to
have
come
down
unchanged
from
their
most
distant
prehistory
the
explorer
burst
out
i
am
not
interested
in
all
that
dry
stuff
give
me
the
wet
what
were
they
like
how
did
they
live
what
did
they
create
what
did
they
want
the
archeologist
gently
waved
aside
the
questions
all
in
good
time
if
i
am
to
tell
you
everything
you
want
to
know
i
must
tell
it
my
own
way
now
that
you
are
back
on
earth
you
will
have
to
reacquire
those
orderly
and
composed
habits
of
thought
which
you
have
partly
lost
in
the
course
of
your
wild
interstellar
adventurings
curse
you
i
think
you
just
trying
to
tantalize
me
the
archeologist
expression
showed
that
this
was
not
altogether
untrue
he
casually
fondled
an
animal
that
had
wriggled
up
onto
his
desk
and
which
looked
rather
more
like
an
eel
than
a
snake
cute
little
brute
is
it
he
remarked
when
it
became
apparent
that
the
explorer
was
to
be
provoked
into
another
outburst
he
continued
it
became
my
task
to
interpret
the
contents
of
the
cache
to
reconstruct
its
makers
climb
from
animalism
and
savagery
to
civilization
their
rather
rapid
spread
across
the
world
surface
their
first
fumbling
attempts
to
escape
from
the
earth
they
had
spaceships
it
barely
possible
i
rather
hope
they
did
since
it
would
mean
the
chance
of
a
survival
elsewhere
though
the
negative
results
of
your
expedition
rather
lessen
that
he
went
on
the
cache
was
laid
down
when
they
were
first
attempting
space
flight
just
after
their
discovery
of
atomic
power
in
the
first
flush
of
their
youth
it
was
probably
created
in
a
kind
of
exuberant
fancifulness
with
no
serious
belief
that
it
would
ever
serve
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
intended
he
looked
at
the
explorer
strangely
if
i
am
not
mistaken
we
have
laid
down
similar
caches
after
a
moment
the
archeologist
continued
my
reconstruction
of
their
history
subsequent
to
the
laying
down
of
the
cache
has
been
largely
hypothetical
i
can
only
guess
at
the
reasons
for
their
decline
and
fall
supplementary
material
has
been
very
slow
in
coming
in
though
we
are
still
making
extensive
excavations
at
widely
separated
points
here
are
the
last
reports
he
tossed
the
explorer
a
small
pamphlet
it
flew
with
a
curiously
slow
motion
that
what
struck
me
so
queer
right
from
the
start
the
explorer
observed
putting
the
pamphlet
aside
after
a
glance
if
these
creatures
were
relatively
advanced
why
have
we
learned
about
them
before
they
must
have
left
so
many
things
buildings
machines
engineering
projects
some
of
them
on
a
large
scale
you
think
be
turning
up
traces
everywhere
i
have
four
answers
to
that
the
archeologist
replied
the
first
is
the
most
obvious
time
geologic
ages
of
it
the
second
is
more
subtle
what
if
we
should
have
been
looking
in
the
wrong
place
i
mean
what
if
the
creatures
occupied
a
very
different
portion
of
the
earth
than
our
own
third
it
possible
that
atomic
energy
out
of
control
finished
the
race
and
destroyed
its
traces
the
present
distribution
of
radioactive
compounds
throughout
the
earth
surface
lends
some
support
to
this
theory
fourth
he
went
on
it
my
belief
that
when
an
intelligent
species
begins
to
retrogress
it
tends
to
destroy
or
rather
debase
all
the
things
it
has
laboriously
created
large
buildings
are
torn
down
to
make
smaller
ones
machines
are
broken
up
and
worked
into
primitive
tools
and
weapons
there
is
a
kind
of
unraveling
or
erasing
a
cultural
second
law
of
thermodynamics
begins
to
operate
whereby
the
intellect
and
all
its
works
are
gradually
degraded
to
the
lowest
level
of
meaning
and
creativity
but
why
the
explorer
sounded
anguished
why
should
any
intelligent
species
end
like
that
i
grant
the
possibility
of
atomic
power
getting
out
of
hand
though
one
would
have
thought
they
have
taken
the
greatest
precautions
still
it
could
happen
but
that
fourth
answer
it
morbid
cultures
and
civilizations
die
said
the
archeologist
evenly
that
has
happened
repeatedly
in
our
own
history
why
not
species
an
individual
dies
and
is
there
anything
intrinsically
more
terrible
in
the
death
of
a
species
than
in
the
death
of
an
individual
he
paused
with
respect
to
the
members
of
this
one
species
i
think
that
a
certain
temperamental
instability
hastened
their
end
their
appetites
and
emotions
were
not
sufficiently
subordinated
to
their
understanding
and
to
their
sense
of
drama
their
enjoyment
of
the
comedy
and
tragedy
of
existence
they
were
impatient
and
easily
incapacitated
by
frustration
they
seem
to
have
been
singularly
guilty
in
their
pleasures
behaving
either
like
gloomy
moralists
or
gluttons
because
of
taboos
and
an
overgrown
possessiveness
he
continued
each
individual
tended
to
limit
his
affection
to
a
tiny
family
in
many
cases
he
focused
his
love
on
himself
alone
they
set
great
store
by
personal
prestige
by
the
amassing
of
wealth
and
the
exercise
of
power
their
notable
capacity
for
thought
and
manipulative
activity
was
expended
on
things
rather
than
persons
or
feelings
their
technology
outstripped
their
psychology
they
skimped
fatally
when
it
came
to
hard
thinking
about
the
purpose
of
life
and
intellectual
activity
and
the
means
for
preserving
them
again
the
slow
shadows
drifted
overhead
and
finally
the
archeologist
said
they
were
a
strangely
haunted
species
they
seem
to
have
been
obsessed
by
the
notion
that
others
greater
than
themselves
had
prospered
before
them
and
then
died
leaving
them
to
rebuild
a
civilization
from
ruins
it
was
from
those
others
that
they
thought
they
derived
the
few
words
and
symbols
common
to
all
their
languages
gods
mused
the
explorer
the
archeologist
shrugged
who
knows
the
explorer
turned
away
his
excitement
had
visibly
evaporated
leaving
behind
a
cold
and
miserable
residue
of
feeling
i
am
not
sure
i
want
to
hear
much
more
about
them
he
said
they
sound
too
much
like
us
perhaps
it
was
a
mistake
my
coming
here
pardon
me
old
friend
but
out
there
in
space
even
emotions
become
undisciplined
everything
becomes
indescribably
poignant
moods
are
tempestuous
you
shift
in
an
instant
from
zenith
to
nadir
and
remember
out
there
you
can
see
both
i
was
very
eager
to
hear
about
this
lost
species
he
added
in
a
sad
voice
i
thought
i
would
feel
a
kind
of
fellowship
with
them
across
the
eons
instead
i
touch
only
corpses
it
reminds
me
of
when
out
in
space
there
looms
up
before
your
prow
faint
in
the
starlight
a
dead
sun
they
were
a
young
race
they
thought
they
were
getting
somewhere
they
promised
themselves
an
eternity
of
effort
and
all
the
while
there
was
wriggling
toward
them
out
of
that
future
for
which
they
yearned
oh
it
so
completely
futile
and
unfair
i
disagree
the
archeologist
said
spiritedly
really
your
absence
from
earth
has
unsettled
you
even
more
than
i
first
surmised
look
at
the
matter
squarely
death
comes
to
everything
in
the
end
our
past
is
strewn
with
our
dead
that
species
died
it
true
but
what
they
achieved
they
achieved
what
happiness
they
had
they
had
what
they
did
in
their
short
span
is
as
significant
as
what
they
might
have
done
had
they
lived
a
billion
years
the
present
is
always
more
important
than
the
future
and
no
creature
can
have
all
the
future
it
must
be
shared
left
to
others
maybe
so
the
explorer
said
slowly
yes
i
guess
you
right
but
i
still
feel
a
horrible
wistfulness
about
them
and
i
hug
to
myself
the
hope
that
a
few
of
them
escaped
and
set
up
a
colony
on
some
planet
we
have
yet
visited
there
was
a
long
silence
then
the
explorer
turned
back
you
old
devil
he
said
in
a
manner
that
showed
his
gayer
and
more
boisterous
mood
had
returned
though
diminished
you
still
have
told
me
anything
definite
about
them
so
i
have
replied
the
archeologist
with
guileful
innocence
well
they
were
vertebrates
oh
yes
what
more
they
were
mammals
mammals
i
was
expecting
something
different
i
thought
you
were
the
explorer
shifted
all
this
matter
of
evolutionary
categories
is
pretty
even
a
knowledge
of
how
they
looked
mean
much
i
like
to
approach
them
in
a
more
intimate
way
how
did
they
think
of
themselves
what
did
they
call
themselves
i
know
the
word
wo
mean
anything
to
me
but
it
will
give
me
a
feeling
of
recognition
i
ca
say
the
word
the
archeologist
told
him
because
i
the
proper
vocal
equipment
but
i
know
enough
of
their
script
to
be
able
to
write
it
for
you
as
they
would
have
written
it
incidentally
it
is
one
of
those
words
common
to
all
their
languages
that
they
attributed
to
an
earlier
race
of
beings
the
archeologist
extended
one
of
his
eight
tentacles
toward
the
blackboard
the
suckers
at
its
tip
firmly
grasped
a
bit
of
orange
crayon
another
of
his
tentacles
took
up
the
spectacles
and
adjusted
them
over
his
protruding
pupils
the
glittering
pet
drifted
back
into
the
room
and
nosed
curiously
about
the
crayon
as
it
traced
rat
