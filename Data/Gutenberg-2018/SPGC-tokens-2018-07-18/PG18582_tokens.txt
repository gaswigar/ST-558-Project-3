preface
having
been
asked
to
write
a
preface
to
the
new
edition
of
the
gypsy
books
i
am
not
a
little
perplexed
i
was
hardly
more
than
a
girl
myself
when
i
recorded
the
history
of
this
young
person
and
i
find
it
hard
at
this
distance
to
photograph
her
as
she
looks
or
ought
to
look
she
does
not
sit
still
long
enough
to
be
taken
i
see
a
lively
girl
in
pretty
short
dresses
and
very
long
stockings
quite
a
if
i
remember
rightly
she
paddles
a
raft
she
climbs
a
tree
she
skates
and
tramps
and
coasts
she
is
usually
very
muddy
and
a
little
torn
there
is
apt
to
be
a
pin
in
her
gathers
but
there
is
sure
to
be
a
laugh
in
her
eyes
wherever
there
is
mischief
there
is
gypsy
yet
wherever
there
is
fun
and
health
and
hope
and
happiness
and
i
think
wherever
there
is
truthfulness
and
generosity
there
is
gypsy
too
and
now
the
publishers
tell
me
that
gypsy
is
thirty
years
old
and
that
girls
who
were
not
so
much
as
born
when
i
knew
the
little
lady
are
her
readers
and
her
friends
thirty
years
old
indeed
it
is
more
than
that
for
is
it
not
thirty
years
since
the
publication
of
her
memoirs
and
was
she
at
that
time
possibly
sixteen
years
incredible
how
in
the
world
did
gypsy
grow
up
for
that
was
before
toboggans
and
telephones
before
bicycles
and
electric
cars
before
bangs
and
puffed
sleeves
before
girls
studied
greek
and
came
in
did
she
go
to
college
for
the
annex
and
smith
and
wellesley
were
not
did
she
have
a
career
or
take
a
husband
did
she
edit
a
quarterly
review
or
sing
a
baby
to
sleep
did
she
write
poetry
or
make
pies
did
she
practice
medicine
or
matrimony
who
knows
not
even
the
author
of
her
being
only
one
thing
i
do
know
gypsy
never
grew
up
to
be
timid
or
silly
or
mean
or
lazy
but
a
sensible
woman
true
and
strong
asking
little
help
of
other
people
but
giving
much
an
honor
to
her
brave
and
loving
sex
and
a
safe
comrade
to
the
girls
who
kept
step
with
her
into
middle
life
and
i
trust
that
i
may
bespeak
from
their
daughters
and
their
scholars
a
kindly
welcome

gypsy
breynton
tom
was
very
proud
of
his
handwriting
it
was
black
and
round
and
rolling
and
readable
and
drowned
in
a
deluge
of
flourishes
with
little
black
curves
in
the
middle
of
them
it
had
been
acquired
in
the
class
of
yorkbury
high
school
and
had
taken
a
prize
at
the
end
of
the
summer
term
and
therefore
did
tom
lean
back
in
his
chair
and
survey
with
intense
satisfaction
the
great
sheet
of
which
was
covered
with
his
scrawlings
tom
was
a
handsome
fellow
if
he
did
look
very
well
pleased
with
himself
at
that
particular
moment
his
curly
hair
was
black
and
bright
and
brushed
off
from
a
full
forehead
and
what
with
that
faint
dark
line
of
moustache
just
visible
above
his
lips
and
that
irresistible
twinkle
to
his
great
merry
eyes
it
was
no
wonder
gypsy
was
proud
of
him
as
indeed
she
certainly
was
nor
did
she
hesitate
to
tell
him
so
twenty
times
a
day
this
was
a
treatment
of
which
tom
decidedly
approved
exactly
how
beneficial
it
was
to
the
growth
within
him
of
modesty
and
the
passive
virtues
generally
is
another
question
the
room
in
which
tom
was
sitting
might
have
been
exhibited
with
profit
by
barnum
as
a
legitimate
relic
of
that
chaos
and
old
night
which
the
poets
tell
us
was
dispelled
by
the
light
of
this
creation
it
had
a
bed
in
it
as
well
as
several
chairs
and
a
carpet
but
it
required
considerable
search
to
discover
them
for
the
billows
of
feminine
drapery
that
were
piled
upon
them
three
dresses
tom
counted
to
make
sure
one
on
the
bedpost
one
rolled
up
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
where
it
had
fallen
and
one
spread
out
on
the
counterpane
with
benzine
on
it
what
with
kerosene
oil
candle
drippings
and
mugs
of
milk
gypsy
managed
to
keep
one
dress
under
the
benzine
treatment
all
the
time
it
was
an
established
institution
and
had
long
ago
ceased
to
arouse
remark
even
from
tom
there
was
also
a
cloak
upon
one
chair
and
a
crocheted
cape
tied
by
the
tassels
on
another
there
was
a
white
tippet
hanging
on
the
stovepipe
there
was
a
bandbox
up
in
one
corner
with
a
pretty
hat
lying
on
the
outside
its
long
light
feather
catching
the
dust
it
was
three
days
now
since
sunday
there
were
also
two
pairs
of
shoes
one
pair
of
rubbers
and
one
slipper
under
the
bed
the
other
slipper
lay
directly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
then
the
wardrobe
door
was
wide
open
it
was
too
full
to
stay
shut
upon
a
sight
which
i
think
even
gypsy
would
hardly
want
put
into
print
white
skirts
and
winter
hoods
that
ought
to
have
been
put
up
in
camphor
long
ago
aprons
hung
up
by
the
trimming
a
calico
dress
that
yawned
mournfully
out
of
a
tear
in
the
skirt
a
pile
of
stockings
that
had
waited
long
and
were
likely
to
wait
longer
for
darning
some
and
a
hatchet
the
bureau
drawers
tom
observed
were
tightly
shut
probably
for
very
good
reasons
the
table
at
which
he
sat
was
a
curiosity
to
the
speculative
mind
the
cloth
was
off
and
slipping
by
a
very
gradual
process
to
the
floor
on
the
remaining
third
stood
an
inkstand
and
a
bottle
of
mucilage
as
well
as
a
huge
pile
of
books
a
glass
tumbler
a
parian
vase
a
a
pair
of
scissors
a
thimble
two
spools
of
thread
a
small
kite
and
a
the
rest
of
the
table
had
been
left
free
to
draw
a
map
on
and
was
covered
with
pencils
and
rubber
compasses
paper
and
torn
geography
leaves
there
were
several
pretty
pictures
on
the
walls
but
they
were
all
hung
crookedly
the
curtain
at
the
window
was
unlooped
and
you
could
write
your
name
anywhere
in
the
dust
that
covered
mantel
stove
and
furniture
and
this
was
gypsy
room
tom
had
spent
a
longer
time
in
looking
at
it
than
i
have
taken
to
tell
about
it
and
when
he
was
through
looking
he
did
one
of
those
things
that
big
brothers
of
sixteen
long
years
experience
in
this
life
who
are
always
teasing
you
and
making
fun
of
you
and
preaching
at
you
are
afflicted
with
a
chronic
and
incurable
tendency
to
do
it
is
very
fortunate
that
gypsy
deserved
it
for
it
was
really
a
horrible
thing
girls
and
if
i
were
you
i
would
let
my
brothers
read
about
it
as
you
value
your
peace
of
mind
lace
collars
clean
clothes
good
tempers
and
private
property
generally
i
put
a
pin
through
these
leaves
or
fasten
them
together
with
or
cut
them
out
before
i
run
the
risk
and
what
did
he
do
why
he
put
a
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
room
tied
a
broom
to
it
he
found
it
in
the
corner
with
a
little
heap
of
dust
behind
it
as
gypsy
had
left
it
when
her
mother
sent
her
up
to
sweep
the
room
that
morning
and
dressed
it
up
in
the
three
dresses
the
cloaks
and
the
cape
one
above
another
the
chair
serving
as
crinoline
upon
the
top
of
the
he
tied
the
torn
apron
stuffed
out
with
the
and
pinned
on
slips
of
the
geography
leaves
for
features
massachusetts
and
vermont
giving
the
graceful
effect
of
one
pink
eye
and
one
yellow
eye
australia
making
a
very
blue
nose
and
japan
a
small
green
mouth
the
hatchet
and
the
served
as
arms
and
the
whole
figure
was
surmounted
by
the
sunday
hat
that
had
the
dust
on
its
feather
from
under
the
hem
of
the
lowest
dress
peeped
the
toes
of
all
the
pairs
of
shoes
and
rubbers
and
the
entire
contents
of
the
sliding
down
to
every
solitary
pencil
needle
and
crumb
of
cake
were
ranged
in
a
line
on
the
carpet
to
crown
the
whole
he
pinned
upon
the
image
that
paper
placard
upon
which
he
had
been
scribbling
when
his
laudable
work
was
completed
this
ingenious
and
remorseless
boy
had
to
stand
and
laugh
at
it
for
five
minutes
if
gypsy
had
only
seen
him
then
and
gypsy
was
nearer
than
he
thought
in
the
front
door
and
coming
up
the
stairs
with
a
great
banging
and
singing
and
laughing
as
nobody
but
gypsy
could
come
up
stairs
tom
just
put
his
hand
on
the
and
gave
one
leap
out
on
the
kitchen
roof
and
gypsy
burst
in
and
stopped
short
tom
crouched
down
against
the
side
of
the
house
and
held
his
breath
for
about
half
a
minute
it
was
perfectly
still
then
a
soft
merry
laugh
broke
out
all
at
once
on
the
air
something
as
a
little
brook
would
splash
down
in
a
sudden
cascade
on
the
rocks
o
oh
did
you
ever
i
never
anything
so
funny
oh
dear
then
it
was
still
again
and
then
the
merry
laugh
began
to
spell
out
the
placard
gypsy
breynton
hon
gypsy
breynton
what
oh
ll
what
a
creature
he
is
gypsy
breynton
i
sure
i
do
know
what
that
means
tom
thom
as
just
then
she
caught
sight
of
him
out
on
the
whittling
away
as
coolly
as
if
he
had
sat
there
all
his
life
good
afternoon
said
gypsy
politely
good
afternoon
said
tom
been
whittling
out
there
ever
since
dinner
i
suppose
certainly
i
thought
so
come
here
a
minute
come
out
here
said
tom
gypsy
climbed
out
of
the
window
without
the
slightest
hesitation
and
walked
along
the
with
the
ease
and
fearlessness
of
a
boy
she
had
on
a
pretty
blue
delaine
dress
which
was
wet
and
torn
and
all
stuck
together
with
burs
her
boots
were
covered
with
mud
to
the
ankle
her
white
stockings
spattered
and
brown
her
turban
was
hanging
round
her
neck
by
its
elastic
her
net
had
come
off
and
the
wind
was
blowing
her
hair
all
over
her
eyes
she
had
her
sack
thrown
over
one
arm
and
a
basket
filled
to
overflowing
with
flowers
and
green
moss
upon
the
other
well
you
a
pretty
sight
said
tom
leisurely
regarding
her
indeed
he
was
not
far
from
right
in
spite
of
the
mud
and
the
burs
and
the
tears
and
the
general
look
about
her
gypsy
managed
somehow
or
other
to
look
as
pretty
as
a
picture
with
her
cheeks
as
red
as
a
coral
and
the
soft
brown
hair
that
was
tossing
about
her
eyes
eyes
were
the
best
part
of
her
they
were
very
large
and
brown
and
had
that
same
irresistible
twinkle
that
was
in
tom
eyes
only
a
great
deal
more
of
it
and
then
it
was
always
there
they
twinkled
when
she
was
happy
and
when
she
was
cross
they
twinkled
over
her
they
twinkled
in
spite
of
themselves
at
church
and
sabbath
school
and
when
she
was
at
play
they
shone
like
a
whole
galaxy
of
stars
if
ever
eyes
ceased
twinkling
people
knew
she
was
going
to
be
sick
her
hair
i
am
sorry
to
say
was
curly
this
was
gypsy
one
unalleviated
affliction
in
life
that
a
girl
could
possibly
be
pretty
with
straight
hair
had
never
once
entered
her
mind
all
the
little
girls
in
had
curls
who
ever
heard
of
the
maiden
that
made
wreaths
of
the
rosebuds
or
saw
the
fairies
or
married
the
prince
and
gypsy
hair
was
not
only
straight
it
was
absolutely
uncurlable
a
week
penance
done
up
in
paper
made
no
more
impression
than
if
you
were
to
pinch
it
however
that
did
not
interfere
with
her
making
a
bit
of
a
picture
perched
up
there
on
the
roof
beside
tom
among
her
burs
and
her
flowers
and
her
moss
her
face
all
dimples
from
forehead
to
chin
where
have
you
been
said
tom
trying
to
look
severe
and
making
a
most
remarkable
failure
oh
only
over
to
the
swamp
after
white
violets
sarah
rowe
she
got
her
two
hands
full
and
then
she
just
fell
splash
into
the
water
full
length
and
lost
oh
dear
me
how
i
laughed
she
did
look
so
funny
your
boots
are
all
mud
said
tom
who
cares
said
gypsy
with
a
merry
laugh
tipping
all
the
wet
earthy
moss
out
on
her
lap
as
she
spoke
see
is
there
a
quantity
i
like
moss
it
fills
up
violets
are
pretty
enough
only
you
have
to
pick
one
at
a
time
innocence
comes
up
by
the
handful
only
most
all
roots
i
do
know
what
going
to
become
of
you
said
tom
drawing
down
the
corner
of
his
mouth
neither
do
i
said
gypsy
demurely
i
wish
i
did
you
wo
learn
to
apply
yourself
to
anything
persisted
tom
work
or
play
there
no
system
to
you
you
like
a
tom
paused
for
a
simile
well
like
a
toad
that
always
on
the
jump
ow
said
gypsy
with
a
little
scream
there
a
horrid
old
snail
crawled
out
my
moss
and
over
went
moss
flowers
basket
and
all
down
the
roof
and
upon
the
stone
steps
below
there
good
enough
for
it
tom
coughed
and
whittled
gypsy
pulled
her
net
out
of
her
basket
and
put
up
her
hair
there
was
a
little
silence
nothing
had
yet
been
said
about
the
image
in
gypsy
room
and
both
were
determined
not
to
be
the
first
to
speak
of
it
gypsy
could
have
patience
enough
where
a
joke
was
in
question
and
as
is
very
apt
to
be
the
case
the
boy
found
himself
outwitted
for
not
a
word
said
gypsy
of
the
matter
and
half
an
hour
passed
and
the
rang
there
said
gypsy
jumping
up
i
do
declare
if
it
is
supper
and
i
got
these
burs
to
get
off
and
my
dress
to
mend
and
my
shoes
and
stockings
to
change
and
oh
dear
i
wish
people
did
ever
have
to
do
things
anyway
with
this
very
wise
remark
she
walked
back
across
the
and
climbed
in
the
window
there
was
nothing
for
tom
to
do
but
follow
which
he
did
slowly
and
reluctantly
something
would
have
to
be
said
now
at
any
rate
but
not
a
syllable
said
gypsy
she
went
to
the
and
began
to
brush
her
hair
as
unconcernedly
as
if
everything
were
just
as
she
left
it
and
precisely
as
she
wanted
it
tom
passed
through
the
room
and
out
of
the
door
then
he
stopped
eyes
began
to
twinkle
as
if
somebody
had
dropped
two
little
diamonds
in
them
i
say
said
tom
what
do
you
say
replied
gypsy
what
do
you
suppose
mother
would
have
to
say
to
you
about
this
room
i
do
know
what
she
say
to
you
i
sure
said
gypsy
gravely
and
you
a
great
girl
twelve
years
old
i
should
like
to
know
why
i
a
railroad
anyway
said
gypsy
who
said
you
were
a
railroad
whoever
wrote
gypsy
breynton
with
my
red
ink
that
does
stand
for
railroad
does
well
what
regular
romp
oh
chapter
ii
a
spasm
of
order
i
ca
help
it
said
gypsy
after
supper
i
ca
possibly
help
it
and
it
no
use
for
me
to
try
if
you
can
not
help
it
replied
breynton
quietly
then
it
is
no
fault
of
yours
but
in
every
way
a
suitable
and
praiseworthy
condition
of
things
that
you
should
keep
your
room
looking
as
i
would
be
ashamed
to
have
a
servant
room
look
in
my
house
people
are
never
to
blame
for
what
they
ca
help
oh
there
it
is
again
said
gypsy
with
the
least
bit
of
a
blush
you
always
stop
me
right
off
with
that
on
every
subject
from
saying
my
prayers
down
to
threading
a
needle
your
mother
was
trained
in
the
theology
and
she
applies
her
principles
to
things
terrestrial
as
well
as
things
celestial
observed
her
father
with
an
amused
smile
yes
sir
said
gypsy
without
the
least
idea
what
he
was
talking
about
besides
added
breynton
finishing
as
she
spoke
the
long
darn
in
gypsy
dress
i
think
people
who
give
right
up
at
little
difficulties
on
the
theory
that
they
ca
help
it
are
oh
i
know
that
too
what
cowards
exactly
i
hate
cowards
said
gypsy
in
a
little
flash
and
then
stood
with
her
back
half
turned
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
carpet
as
if
she
were
puzzling
out
a
proposition
in
euclid
somewhere
hidden
in
its
brown
take
a
chair
and
sit
by
the
window
and
think
of
it
remarked
tom
in
his
most
aggravating
tone
that
precisely
what
i
intend
to
do
sir
said
gypsy
and
was
as
good
as
her
word
she
went
and
shut
her
door
and
what
was
remarkable
nobody
saw
anything
more
of
her
what
was
still
more
remarkable
nobody
heard
anything
of
her
for
a
little
while
it
was
perfectly
still
overhead
i
hope
she
is
crying
said
breynton
who
was
always
afraid
gypsy
was
doing
something
she
ought
not
to
do
and
who
was
in
about
such
a
state
of
continual
astonishment
over
the
little
romp
that
had
been
making
such
commotion
in
his
quiet
home
for
twelve
years
as
a
respectable
and
oyster
might
be
if
a
lively
young
toad
were
shut
up
in
his
shell
catch
her
said
the
more
appreciative
tom
i
do
believe
she
cries
four
times
a
year
that
the
best
part
of
gyp
with
all
her
faults
there
none
of
your
girl
nonsense
about
her
another
person
in
the
room
who
had
listened
to
the
conversation
went
off
at
this
period
into
a
sudden
fit
of
curiosity
concerning
gypsy
and
started
to
find
her
this
was
master
winthrop
breynton
familiarly
and
disrespectfully
known
as
winnie
a
word
must
be
said
as
to
this
young
person
for
whatever
he
may
be
in
the
eyes
of
other
people
he
was
of
considerable
importance
in
his
own
he
had
several
distinguishing
characteristics
as
is
apt
to
be
the
case
with
gentlemen
of
his
age
and
experience
one
was
that
he
was
five
lengthy
and
important
years
of
age
of
which
impressive
fact
his
friends
relatives
and
chance
acquaintances
were
informed
at
every
possible
and
impossible
opportunity
another
was
that
there
were
always
half
a
dozen
buttons
off
from
his
jacket
at
all
times
and
places
though
his
mother
lived
in
her
a
third
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
never
walked
he
trotted
he
cantered
he
galloped
he
progressed
in
jerks
in
jumps
in
somersets
he
crawled
like
a
little
scotch
plaid
spider
on
all
fours
he
came
down
stairs
on
the
banisters
the
balance
of
power
lying
between
his
steel
buttons
and
the
smooth
varnish
of
the
mahogany
on
several
memorable
occasions
he
has
narrowly
escaped
pitching
head
first
into
the
hall
lamp
his
favorite
method
of
locomotion
however
consisted
in
a
series
of
beginning
with
a
gentle
tread
and
increasing
in
impetus
by
mathematical
progression
till
it
ended
in
a
a
long
hall
to
him
was
bliss
unalloyed
the
bare
garret
floor
a
dream
of
delight
and
the
plank
walk
in
the
woodshed
an
ecstasy
still
a
fourth
peculiarity
was
a
pleasing
habit
when
matters
went
contrary
to
his
expressed
wishes
of
throwing
himself
full
length
upon
the
floor
without
any
warning
whatsoever
squirming
around
in
his
clothes
and
crying
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
added
to
this
is
the
fact
that
for
some
unaccountable
reason
winnie
eyes
were
so
blue
and
winnie
laugh
so
funny
and
winnie
hands
were
so
pink
and
little
that
somehow
or
other
winnie
did
get
half
the
scoldings
he
deserved
but
who
is
there
of
us
that
does
for
that
matter
well
winnie
it
was
who
stamped
across
the
hall
and
crawled
hand
over
hand
and
stamped
across
the
upper
entry
and
pounded
on
door
and
burst
it
open
and
slammed
in
with
one
of
winnie
inimitable
shouts
oh
i
say
father
wants
to
know
if
just
what
you
done
winnie
stopped
short
in
considerable
astonishment
gypsy
was
sitting
on
the
floor
beside
one
of
her
bureau
drawers
which
she
had
pulled
out
of
its
place
that
drawer
was
a
sight
well
worth
seeing
by
the
way
but
of
that
presently
gypsy
had
taken
out
of
it
a
little
box
without
a
cover
like
all
gypsy
boxes
filled
with
beadwork
collars
cuffs
nets
and
bracelets
all
tumbled
in
together
and
as
much
as
a
handful
of
loose
beads
of
every
size
color
and
description
thrown
down
on
the
bottom
gypsy
was
sorting
these
beads
and
this
was
what
had
kept
her
so
still
now
winnie
in
slamming
into
the
room
after
his
usual
style
had
stepped
directly
into
the
box
crushed
its
pasteboard
flat
and
scattered
the
unlucky
beads
to
all
four
points
of
the
compass
gypsy
sat
for
about
half
a
minute
watching
the
stream
of
crimson
and
blue
and
black
and
silver
and
gold
that
was
rolling
away
under
the
bed
and
the
chair
and
the
table
her
face
a
perfect
little
then
she
took
hold
of
winnie
shoulder
without
any
remarks
and
shook
him
it
was
a
little
shake
and
if
it
had
been
given
in
good
temper
would
not
have
struck
winnie
as
anything
but
a
pleasant
joke
but
he
knew
from
gypsy
face
it
was
no
joke
and
feeling
his
dignity
insulted
down
he
went
flat
upon
the
floor
with
a
scream
and
a
jerk
that
sent
two
fresh
buttons
flying
off
from
his
jacket
breynton
ran
in
a
great
hurry
what
the
matter
gypsy
she
sh
sh
shooked
me
the
old
thing
sobbed
winnie
he
broke
my
box
and
lost
all
my
beads
and
i
got
them
all
to
pick
up
just
as
i
was
trying
to
put
my
room
in
order
and
so
i
was
mad
said
gypsy
frankly
winnie
you
may
go
down
stairs
said
breynton
you
must
learn
to
be
more
careful
with
gypsy
things
winnie
slid
down
on
the
banisters
and
breynton
shut
the
door
what
are
you
trying
to
do
gypsy
pick
up
my
room
said
gypsy
but
what
had
that
to
do
with
stringing
the
beads
why
i
do
know
exactly
i
took
out
my
drawer
to
fix
it
up
and
my
beads
were
all
in
a
muss
and
so
i
thought
i
sort
them
and
then
i
forgot
i
see
several
things
in
the
room
that
want
putting
in
order
before
a
little
box
of
beads
said
breynton
with
a
smile
that
was
half
amused
half
sorrowful
gypsy
cast
a
deprecating
glance
around
the
room
and
into
her
mother
face
oh
i
mean
to
shut
the
wardrobe
door
and
i
thought
i
taken
the
broom
down
stairs
as
much
as
could
be
but
that
everlasting
tom
had
to
go
and
oh
dear
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
funny
in
all
your
life
and
gypsy
looked
at
the
image
and
broke
into
one
of
her
rippling
laughs
it
is
really
a
serious
matter
gypsy
said
breynton
looking
somewhat
troubled
at
the
laugh
i
know
it
said
gypsy
sobering
down
and
i
came
on
purpose
to
put
everything
to
rights
and
then
i
was
going
to
live
like
other
people
and
keep
my
stockings
darned
and
then
i
had
to
go
head
first
into
a
box
of
beads
and
that
was
the
end
of
me
it
always
so
you
know
gypsy
it
is
one
of
the
signs
of
a
lady
to
keep
one
room
in
order
i
told
you
so
many
times
i
know
it
said
gypsy
forlornly
do
you
remember
when
i
was
a
little
bit
of
a
thing
my
telling
you
that
i
guessed
god
made
a
mistake
when
he
made
me
and
put
in
some
somehow
that
was
always
going
off
it
pretty
much
so
the
cork
always
coming
out
at
the
wrong
time
well
said
breynton
with
a
smile
i
glad
you
trying
afresh
to
hammer
it
in
pick
up
the
beads
and
tear
down
the
image
and
go
to
work
with
a
little
system
you
be
surprised
to
find
how
fast
the
room
will
come
to
order
i
think
she
added
as
she
shut
the
door
that
it
was
hardly
worth
while
to
to
shake
winnie
interrupted
gypsy
demurely
no
not
at
all
i
ought
to
have
known
better
breynton
did
not
offer
to
help
gypsy
in
the
task
which
bade
fair
to
be
no
easy
one
of
putting
her
room
in
order
but
with
a
few
encouraging
words
she
went
down
stairs
and
left
her
it
would
have
been
far
easier
for
her
to
have
gone
to
work
and
done
the
thing
herself
than
to
see
gypsy
face
so
clouded
and
discouraged
but
she
knew
it
would
be
the
ruin
of
gypsy
her
only
chance
of
overcoming
her
natural
thoughtlessness
and
acquiring
the
habits
of
a
lady
lay
in
the
persistent
doing
over
and
over
again
by
her
own
unaided
patience
these
very
things
that
came
so
hard
to
her
gypsy
understood
this
perfectly
and
had
the
good
sense
to
think
her
mother
was
just
right
about
it
it
was
not
want
of
training
that
gave
gypsy
her
careless
fashion
of
looking
after
things
breynton
was
a
wise
as
well
as
a
loving
mother
and
had
done
everything
in
the
way
of
punishment
reproof
warning
persuasion
and
argument
that
mothers
can
do
for
the
faults
of
children
nor
was
it
for
want
of
a
good
example
breynton
was
the
very
pink
of
neatness
it
was
a
natural
in
gypsy
that
was
as
hard
to
get
out
as
a
knot
in
an
and
which
depended
entirely
on
the
child
own
will
for
its
eradication
this
disorder
in
her
room
and
about
her
toilet
was
only
one
development
of
it
and
by
no
means
a
fixed
or
continued
one
gypsy
could
be
and
half
the
time
she
was
as
orderly
and
as
anybody
she
did
everything
by
fits
and
starts
as
tom
said
she
was
always
on
the
jump
if
her
dress
did
happen
to
be
torn
and
her
room
dusty
why
she
had
a
turn
of
forgetting
everything
if
she
did
forget
she
was
always
getting
hurt
if
it
was
that
she
lost
her
temper
every
five
minutes
or
else
she
was
making
terrible
blunders
and
hurting
people
feelings
something
was
always
the
matter
and
some
one
was
always
on
the
wondering
what
gypsy
was
going
to
do
next
yet
in
spite
of
it
all
the
person
who
did
not
love
gypsy
breynton
provided
he
knew
her
was
not
to
be
found
in
yorkbury
whether
there
was
any
reason
for
this
you
can
judge
for
yourself
as
the
story
goes
on
after
her
mother
had
gone
down
gypsy
went
to
work
in
earnest
she
picked
up
the
beads
and
put
them
back
into
the
drawer
which
she
left
upon
the
floor
then
she
attacked
tom
image
it
took
her
fully
fifteen
minutes
merely
to
get
the
thing
to
pieces
for
the
true
in
which
it
was
tied
pinned
sewed
and
nailed
together
would
have
been
a
puzzle
to
any
feminine
mind
she
would
have
called
tom
up
to
help
her
but
she
was
just
a
little
bit
too
proud
the
broom
she
put
out
in
the
entry
the
first
thing
then
remembering
that
that
was
not
systematic
she
carried
it
down
stairs
and
hung
it
on
its
nail
the
shoes
and
the
dresses
the
cape
and
the
cloak
the
tippet
and
the
hat
she
put
in
their
places
the
torn
apron
and
the
unmended
stockings
she
tumbled
into
her
basket
then
went
back
and
folded
them
up
neatly
she
also
made
a
journey
into
the
woodshed
expressly
to
put
the
hatchet
where
it
belonged
on
the
by
this
time
it
was
quite
dark
but
she
lighted
a
lamp
and
went
at
it
afresh
winnie
came
up
to
the
entry
door
and
at
a
respectful
distance
told
her
they
were
popping
corn
down
stairs
but
she
shook
her
head
and
proceeded
with
her
dusting
like
a
hero
tom
whistled
for
her
up
the
but
she
only
gave
a
little
thump
on
the
floor
and
said
she
was
busy
it
was
like
walking
into
a
labyrinth
to
dispose
of
the
contents
of
that
how
to
put
away
the
pencils
and
the
rubber
when
the
was
lost
how
to
collect
all
the
and
wandering
needles
that
slipped
out
of
your
finger
as
fast
as
you
took
hold
of
them
where
on
earth
to
put
those
torn
geography
leaves
that
would
stay
in
the
book
and
could
be
thrown
away
where
the
cork
to
the
inkstand
and
how
should
she
hang
up
the
with
the
string
gone
these
were
questions
that
might
well
puzzle
a
more
systematic
mind
than
gypsy
however
in
due
time
the
room
was
restored
to
an
order
that
was
delightful
to
see
for
if
gypsy
made
up
her
mind
to
a
thing
she
could
do
it
thoroughly
and
skilfully
and
she
returned
to
the
bureau
drawer
this
drawer
was
a
fair
specimen
of
the
rest
of
gypsy
drawers
shelves
and
cupboards
and
their
name
was
legion
moreover
it
was
an
upper
drawer
and
where
is
the
girl
that
does
not
know
what
a
delicate
science
is
involved
in
the
rearranging
of
these
upper
drawers
so
many
laces
and
collars
that
do
belong
there
are
always
getting
in
loose
coppers
have
such
a
way
of
accumulating
in
the
crevices
all
your
wandering
pins
and
make
it
a
rendezvous
by
a
species
of
utterly
inexplicable
then
your
little
boxes
fit
in
so
tightly
and
never
have
room
to
open
and
are
always
getting
their
covers
caught
when
you
shut
the
drawer
and
when
you
try
to
keep
them
down
you
pinch
your
fingers
so
please
to
imagine
o
orderly
readers
who
keep
every
pin
in
its
proper
place
the
worst
looking
upper
drawer
that
your
horrified
eyes
ever
beheld
and
you
will
have
some
idea
of
this
drawer
of
gypsy
there
were
boxes
large
and
boxes
small
boxes
round
square
and
oblong
boxes
with
covers
only
two
and
boxes
without
handkerchiefs
collars
both
clean
and
soiled
laces
and
ribbons
and
bows
and
nets
purses
and
old
gloves
a
piece
of
soap
a
pile
of
letters
scratched
and
scattering
jewelry
a
piece
of
dried
cake
several
fans
all
covered
with
dust
and
nobody
knew
what
not
in
the
lower
strata
out
of
sight
gypsy
sat
and
looked
at
it
for
about
two
minutes
in
utter
despair
then
she
just
turned
the
whole
thing
bottom
upwards
in
a
great
heap
on
the
floor
and
began
to
investigate
matters
with
her
cheeks
very
red
presently
the
family
down
stairs
heard
a
little
scream
winnie
stamped
up
to
see
what
was
the
matter
why
i
found
my
grammar
said
gypsy
it
the
one
in
marble
covers
i
lost
ever
ever
so
long
ago
and
had
to
get
a
new
one
it
was
right
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
drawer
pretty
soon
there
was
another
little
scream
and
gypsy
called
down
the
chimney
tom
breynton
what
do
you
think
i
found
that
dollar
bill
of
yours
you
thought
i
burnt
up
after
awhile
there
came
still
another
scream
a
pretty
loud
one
this
time
breynton
came
up
to
see
what
had
happened
i
cut
my
hand
said
gypsy
faintly
there
was
a
great
heap
of
broken
glass
in
my
drawer
glass
yes
i
sure
i
do
know
how
it
came
there
i
guess
i
was
going
to
frame
a
picture
breynton
bound
up
her
finger
and
went
down
again
she
was
no
more
than
fairly
seated
before
there
came
from
not
a
scream
but
one
of
the
merriest
laughs
that
ever
was
heard
what
is
to
pay
now
called
tom
from
the
entry
oh
dear
gasped
gypsy
it
too
funny
for
anything
if
here
is
the
we
scolded
patty
for
losing
last
winter
and
oh
tom
just
look
here
my
stick
of
peanut
candy
that
i
thought
i
eaten
up
all
stuck
on
to
my
lace
it
was
past
gypsy
when
the
upper
drawer
was
fairly
in
order
and
put
back
in
its
place
three
others
remained
to
go
through
the
same
process
as
well
as
wardrobe
shelves
innumerable
gypsy
with
her
characteristic
impulsiveness
would
have
sat
up
till
twelve
to
complete
the
work
but
her
mother
said
no
very
decidedly
and
so
it
must
wait
till
tom
came
in
just
as
everything
was
done
and
gypsy
had
drawn
a
long
breath
and
stood
up
to
look
with
great
satisfaction
all
around
her
pleasant
orderly
room
well
done
i
say
gypsy
what
a
jewel
you
are
when
you
a
mind
to
be
of
course
i
am
have
you
just
found
it
out
well
you
know
you
a
diamond
decidedly
in
the
rough
as
a
general
thing
you
need
cutting
down
and
polishing
and
you
to
polish
me
well
i
like
the
looks
of
this
room
anyhow
it
nice
to
have
things
somewhere
where
you
wo
trip
over
them
when
you
walk
across
the
room
only
if
somebody
else
would
pick
up
for
me
how
long
do
you
suppose
it
will
last
asked
tom
with
an
air
of
great
superiority
tom
said
gypsy
solemnly
that
a
serious
question
it
might
last
forever
if
you
have
a
mind
to
have
it
come
now
why
not
that
a
long
time
said
gypsy
shaking
her
head
i
would
trust
myself
two
inches
i
shall
be
in
a
hurry
to
go
to
school
then
i
shall
be
in
a
hurry
to
go
to
dinner
then
i
shall
be
in
a
hurry
to
get
off
with
sarah
rowe
and
so
it
goes
however
i
see
i
feel
precisely
as
if
i
should
never
want
to
take
a
single
pin
out
of
those
little
black
squares
i
put
them
into
on
the
cushion
gypsy
found
herself
in
a
hurry
the
next
day
and
the
next
and
is
likely
to
to
the
end
of
her
life
i
am
afraid
but
she
seemed
to
have
taken
a
little
gasp
of
order
and
for
a
long
time
no
one
had
any
complaint
to
make
of
gypsy
room
or
gypsy
toilet
chapter
iii
miss
melville
visitor
as
will
be
readily
supposed
gypsy
name
was
not
her
original
one
though
it
might
have
been
for
there
have
been
actual
billys
and
sallys
who
began
and
ended
billys
and
sallys
only
gypsy
real
name
was
an
uncouth
one
jemima
it
was
partly
for
this
reason
partly
for
its
singular
appropriateness
that
her
nickname
had
entirely
transplanted
the
lawful
and
ugly
one
this
subject
of
nicknames
is
a
curiosity
all
rules
of
euphony
fitness
and
common
sense
that
apply
to
other
things
are
utterly
at
fault
here
a
baby
who
can
not
talk
plainly
dubs
himself
tuty
or
dess
or
pet
or
honey
and
forthwith
becomes
tuty
dess
pet
or
honey
the
rest
of
his
mortal
life
all
the
particularly
cross
and
disagreeable
girls
are
birdies
and
sunbeams
all
the
brunettes
with
loud
voices
and
red
hands
who
are
growing
up
into
the
women
are
lilies
and
effies
and
angelinas
and
other
etherial
creatures
while
the
little
shallow
young
ladies
who
cry
very
often
and
get
nervous
are
quite
as
likely
to
be
royal
constance
or
elizabeth
without
any
nickname
at
all
but
gypsy
name
had
undoubtedly
been
foreordained
so
perfectly
was
it
suited
to
gypsy
for
never
a
wild
rover
led
a
more
untamed
and
happy
life
summer
and
winter
and
harvest
found
gypsy
out
in
the
open
air
as
many
hours
out
of
the
as
were
not
absolutely
bolted
and
barred
down
into
the
and
dreamland
a
fear
of
the
weather
never
entered
into
gypsy
creed
drenchings
and
freezings
were
so
many
great
fun
while
they
lasted
and
blown
right
away
by
dry
stockings
and
mother
warm
fire
so
where
was
the
harm
a
good
brisk
thunderstorm
out
in
the
woods
with
the
lightning
quivering
all
about
her
and
the
thunder
crashing
over
her
was
simple
delight
a
day
of
snow
and
sleet
with
drifts
and
winds
like
so
many
little
knives
was
a
festival
if
you
do
know
the
supreme
bliss
of
a
walk
on
such
a
day
when
you
have
to
shut
your
eyes
and
wade
your
way
then
gypsy
would
pity
you
not
a
patch
of
woods
a
pond
a
brook
a
river
a
mountain
in
the
region
and
there
in
vermont
there
were
plenty
of
them
but
gypsy
knew
it
by
heart
there
was
not
a
for
miles
where
she
had
not
fished
there
was
hardly
a
tree
she
had
not
climbed
or
a
fence
or
provided
of
course
that
it
was
away
from
the
main
road
and
people
eyes
that
she
had
not
walked
gypsy
could
row
and
skate
and
swim
and
play
ball
and
make
kites
and
coast
and
race
and
drive
and
chop
wood
altogether
gypsy
seemed
like
a
very
pretty
piquant
mistake
as
if
a
mischievous
boy
had
somehow
stolen
the
plaid
dresses
red
cheeks
quick
wit
and
little
indescribable
graces
of
a
girl
and
was
playing
off
a
continual
joke
on
the
world
old
surly
who
lived
opposite
and
wore
green
spectacles
used
to
roll
up
her
eyes
and
say
what
become
of
that
child
a
whit
cared
gypsy
for
surly
as
long
as
her
mother
thought
the
sport
and
exercise
in
the
open
air
a
fine
thing
for
her
and
did
not
complain
of
the
torn
dresses
oftener
than
twice
a
week
she
would
roll
her
hoop
and
toss
her
ball
under
surly
very
windows
and
laugh
merrily
to
see
the
green
glasses
pushed
up
and
taken
off
in
horror
at
what
surly
termed
an
impropriety
therefore
it
created
no
surprise
in
the
family
one
morning
when
came
and
passed
and
gypsy
did
not
make
her
appearance
that
she
was
reported
to
be
making
a
raft
down
in
the
orchard
swamp
run
and
call
her
winnie
said
breynton
tell
her
it
is
very
late
and
i
want
her
to
come
right
up
remember
yes
mum
said
winnie
with
unusual
alacrity
and
started
off
down
the
lane
as
fast
as
his
feet
could
carry
him
it
was
quite
a
long
lane
and
a
very
pleasant
one
in
summer
there
was
a
row
of
bushes
always
green
and
sweet
on
one
side
and
a
on
the
other
with
the
broad
leaves
and
tiny
blossoms
of
a
trailing
over
it
the
lane
opened
into
a
wide
field
which
had
an
at
one
end
of
it
and
sloped
down
over
quite
a
little
hill
into
a
piece
of
marshy
ground
where
ferns
and
white
violets
anemones
and
grew
in
abundance
in
the
summer
the
water
was
apt
to
dry
up
in
the
spring
it
was
sometimes
four
feet
deep
it
was
a
pleasant
spot
for
the
mountains
lay
all
around
it
and
shut
it
in
with
their
great
and
the
sharp
peaks
that
were
purple
and
crimson
and
gold
under
passing
shadows
and
fading
sunsets
and
then
is
there
any
better
fun
than
to
paddle
in
the
water
gypsy
looked
as
if
she
thought
not
when
winnie
suddenly
turned
the
corner
and
ran
down
the
slope
she
had
finished
her
raft
and
launched
it
off
from
the
root
of
an
old
that
grew
half
in
the
water
and
with
a
long
pole
had
pushed
herself
a
third
of
the
way
across
the
swamp
her
dress
was
tucked
up
over
her
bright
balmoral
and
the
ribbons
of
her
hat
were
streaming
in
the
wind
she
had
no
mittens
or
gloves
on
her
hands
which
were
very
pink
and
plump
and
her
feet
were
incased
in
high
rubber
boots
hullo
said
winnie
walking
out
on
the
root
of
the
oak
hilloa
said
gypsy
i
say
that
a
bully
raft
to
be
sure
it
is
i
have
had
a
ride
on
a
raft
since
why
since
or
six
years
ago
when
i
was
a
little
boy
i
should
wonder
if
it
was
years
either
oh
i
ca
bear
people
that
hint
why
do
you
say
right
out
if
you
want
a
ride
i
want
a
ride
said
winnie
without
any
hesitation
wait
till
i
turn
her
round
i
bring
her
up
on
the
larboard
side
replied
gypsy
in
the
tone
of
an
old
salt
of
fifty
years
experience
so
she
paddled
up
to
the
and
winnie
jumped
on
board
i
guess
we
have
time
to
row
across
and
back
before
school
said
gypsy
pushing
off
winnie
maintained
a
discreet
silence
i
do
suppose
it
very
late
said
gypsy
oh
just
look
at
that
toad
with
a
green
head
down
in
the
water
observed
winnie
they
paddled
on
a
little
ways
in
silence
what
makes
your
cheeks
so
red
asked
gypsy
i
guess
it
scarlet
fever
or
maybe
it
appleplexy
you
know
oh
just
then
winnie
gave
a
little
scream
look
here
the
boat
down
i
do
want
to
go
very
much
i
saw
another
toad
down
there
i
declare
said
gypsy
we
going
to
be
swamped
as
true
as
you
live
it
is
strong
enough
to
bear
two
sit
still
winnie
perhaps
we
get
ashore
but
no
sooner
had
she
spoken
the
words
than
the
water
washed
up
about
her
ankles
and
winnie
end
of
the
raft
went
under
the
next
she
knew
they
were
both
floundering
in
the
water
it
chanced
to
be
about
three
feet
and
a
half
deep
very
cold
and
somewhat
slimy
gypsy
had
a
strong
impression
that
a
frog
jumped
into
her
neck
when
she
plunged
head
first
into
the
deep
mud
at
the
bottom
after
a
little
splashing
and
gasping
she
regained
her
feet
and
stood
up
to
her
elbows
in
the
water
but
what
she
could
do
winnie
could
not
he
had
sunk
in
the
soft
mud
and
even
if
he
had
had
the
courage
to
stand
up
straight
the
water
would
have
been
above
his
head
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
do
otherwise
than
lie
gasping
and
flat
on
the
bottom
where
he
was
drowning
as
fast
as
he
possibly
could
gypsy
pulled
him
out
and
carried
him
ashore
she
wrung
him
out
a
little
and
set
him
down
on
the
grass
and
then
by
way
of
doing
something
she
took
her
dripping
handkerchief
out
of
her
dripping
pocket
and
wiped
her
hands
on
it
o
o
oh
gasped
winnie
i
never
did
you
ought
to
know
you
just
drownded
me
what
a
story
said
gypsy
you
no
more
drowned
than
i
am
to
be
sure
you
rather
wet
she
added
with
a
disconsolate
attempt
at
a
laugh
you
ought
to
have
tooken
me
out
on
that
old
raft
glared
winnie
through
the
shower
of
that
rained
down
from
his
forehead
you
know
you
had
i
just
tell
mother
i
get
sick
and
be
died
after
it
you
see
if
i
do
very
well
said
gypsy
giving
herself
a
little
shake
very
much
as
a
pretty
brown
spaniel
would
do
who
had
been
in
swimming
you
may
do
as
you
like
who
teased
to
go
on
the
raft
i
like
to
know
resumed
winnie
with
an
impressive
cough
you
late
to
school
mother
she
said
you
was
to
come
right
up
when
she
sent
me
down
only
i
well
i
guess
i
i
forgot
to
tell
you
i
rather
think
i
did
anyways
you
late
gypsy
looked
at
winnie
and
winnie
looked
at
gypsy
there
was
an
awful
silence
winnie
breynton
said
gypsy
solemnly
if
you
do
get
one
whipping
i
do
care
to
hear
folks
talk
interrupted
winnie
with
dignity
i
am
five
years
old
gypsy
reply
is
not
recorded
i
have
heard
it
said
that
when
tom
espied
the
two
children
coming
up
the
lane
he
went
to
his
mother
with
the
information
that
the
fishman
was
somewhere
around
only
he
had
sent
his
fishes
on
ahead
of
him
they
appeared
to
have
been
freshly
caught
and
would
he
thought
make
several
dinners
but
i
can
not
take
the
responsibility
of
the
statement
it
was
very
late
much
nearer
ten
than
nine
when
gypsy
was
fairly
metamorphosed
into
a
clean
dry
very
child
she
hurried
off
to
school
leaving
winnie
and
his
mother
in
close
conference
exactly
what
happened
on
the
occasion
of
that
interview
has
never
been
made
known
to
an
inquiring
public
on
the
way
to
school
gypsy
had
as
many
as
six
sober
thoughts
a
larger
number
than
she
was
usually
capable
of
in
hours
one
was
that
it
was
too
bad
she
had
got
so
wet
another
was
that
she
really
supposed
it
was
her
business
to
know
when
came
no
matter
where
she
was
or
what
she
was
doing
another
that
she
had
made
her
mother
a
great
deal
of
trouble
a
fourth
was
that
she
was
sorry
to
be
so
late
at
school
it
always
made
miss
melville
look
so
and
then
a
bad
mark
was
not
on
the
whole
a
desirable
thing
still
a
fifth
was
that
she
would
never
do
such
a
thing
again
as
long
as
she
lived
the
sixth
lay
in
a
valiant
determination
to
behave
herself
the
rest
of
this
particular
day
she
would
study
hard
she
would
get
to
the
head
of
the
class
she
would
put
a
single
pin
in
the
girls
chairs
nor
tickle
anybody
nor
make
up
funny
faces
nor
whisper
nor
make
one
of
the
girls
laugh
not
one
not
even
that
silly
delia
guest
who
laughed
at
nothing
why
you
could
so
much
as
make
a
doll
out
of
your
handkerchief
and
gloves
and
hang
it
on
your
but
what
she
had
to
go
into
a
spasm
over
it
no
she
would
do
a
single
funny
thing
all
day
she
would
just
sit
still
and
look
sober
and
sorry
and
not
trouble
miss
melville
in
the
least
her
mind
was
quite
made
up
just
as
she
had
arrived
at
this
conclusion
she
came
to
the
door
gypsy
and
a
number
of
other
girls
both
her
own
age
and
younger
who
either
were
not
prepared
to
enter
the
high
school
or
whose
parents
preferred
the
select
school
system
composed
miss
melville
charge
they
were
most
of
them
pleasant
girls
and
miss
melville
was
an
unusually
successful
teacher
and
as
dearly
loved
as
a
judicious
teacher
can
be
the
was
a
bit
of
a
brown
building
tucked
away
under
some
on
a
quiet
it
had
been
built
for
a
district
school
but
had
fallen
into
disuse
years
ago
and
miss
melville
had
taken
possession
of
it
gypsy
slackened
her
pace
as
she
passed
under
the
where
the
tiny
budding
leaves
filled
all
the
air
with
faint
fragrance
it
was
nearly
recess
time
she
knew
because
she
could
hear
through
the
windows
the
third
geography
class
reciting
it
was
really
too
bad
to
be
so
late
she
went
up
the
steps
slowly
the
corners
of
her
mouth
drawn
down
as
penitently
as
gypsy
mouth
could
well
be
just
inside
the
door
she
stopped
a
quick
color
ran
all
over
her
face
her
eyes
began
to
twinkle
like
sparks
from
a
great
fire
of
hickory
and
in
an
instant
every
one
of
those
six
sober
thoughts
was
gone
away
somewhere
nobody
could
have
told
where
and
the
funniest
little
laugh
broke
the
silence
of
the
entry
the
most
interested
observer
could
not
have
told
what
gypsy
saw
that
was
so
very
amusing
the
entry
was
quite
deserted
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
a
long
row
of
girls
things
hanging
up
on
the
nails
hats
and
bonnets
tippets
sacks
rubbers
and
baskets
apparently
as
demure
and
respectable
as
hats
bonnets
tippets
sacks
rubbers
and
baskets
could
be
yet
there
gypsy
stood
for
as
much
as
a
minute
laughing
away
quietly
to
herself
as
if
she
had
come
across
some
remarkable
joke
about
ten
minutes
after
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
miss
melville
laid
down
her
geography
cape

little
cely

holding
up
her
hand
miss
melville
nodded
and
cely
went
she
opened
the
door
and
jumped
what
the
matter
cely
oh
for
there
stood
the
funniest
old
woman
that
cely
or
miss
melville
had
ever
seen
she
had
on
a
black
dress
very
long
and
very
scant
that
looked
as
if
it
were
made
out
of
an
old
waterproof
cloak
over
that
she
wore
a
curious
sack
somewhat
faded
and
patched
with
all
the
edges
of
the
seams
outside
over
that
was
a
plaid
shawl
tied
about
her
waist
there
was
a
little
black
shawl
over
that
and
a
green
tippet
wound
twice
around
her
throat
with
the
ends
tucked
in
under
the
shawl
she
had
a
pair
of
black
mitts
on
her
hands
and
she
carried
a
basket
her
face
no
one
could
see
for
it
was
covered
with
a
thick
green
veil
tied
closely
about
her
bonnet
cely
gave
a
little
scream
and
ran
behind
the
door
miss
melville
stepped
down
from
the
platform
and
went
to
meet
the
visitor
good
arternoon
said
the
old
woman
in
a
very
shrill
voice
good

melville

out
the
scholars
all
began
to
laugh
miss
melville
somewhat
reluctantly
handed
her
visitor
a
chair
by
the
door
but
did
not
ask
her
upon
the
platform
as
the
visitor
seemed
to
expect
there
a
drefful
draught
here
on
my
neck
she
muttered
discontentedly

i

gal
and
the
stranger
pointed
her
finger
it
trembled
a
little
at
sarah
rowe
who
had
grown
quite
red
in
the
face
with
her
polite
efforts
not
to
laugh
little

here
and
le
hear
ye
say
that
beautiful
psalm
of
dr
watts
now
how
doth
the
little
busy
bee
but
just
then
something
happened
for
which
the
old
woman
and
the
scholars
were
equally
unprepared
miss
melville
looked
through
the
green
veil
straight
into
the
old
woman
eyes
and
said
just
one
word
she
said
it
very
quietly
and
she
said
it
without
a
smile
it
was
gypsy
there
was
a
great
hush
sarah
rowe
was
the
first
to
break
it
why
that
my
sack
turned
wrong
side
out
and
those
are
my
mitts
said
agnes
gaylord
if
you
please
miss
melville
that
my
black
shawl
i
know
it
by
the
border
piped
a
very
little
girl
in
mourning
i
do
believe
that
my
waterproof
and
lucy
plaid
shawl
giggled
delia
guest
did
you
and
my
green
veil
put
in
somebody
else
faintly
miss
melville
quietly
removed
the
veil
and
gypsy
looked
up
with
her
mischief
bright
all
over
her
face
her
eyes
fell
however
and
her
cheeks
flushed
crimson
when
she
saw
the
look
about
miss
melville
mouth
you
may
go
and
put
away
the
things
gypsy
said
miss
melville
still
without
a
smile
gypsy
obeyed
in
silence
the
girls
stopped
laughing
and
began
to
whisper
together
behind
the
the
school
will
come
to
order
said
miss
melville
cely
what
is
the
largest
river
in
new
england
next
gypsy
hung
up
the
things
and
came
slowly
back
into
the
room
miss
melville
motioned
her
to
her
seat
but
took
no
further
notice
of
her
gypsy
silent
and
ashamed
took
out
her
and
began
to
study
the
girls
looked
at
her
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
and
every
now
and
then
delia
guest
broke
out
afresh
into
a
smothered
laugh
but
no
one
spoke
to
her
and
she
spoke
to
nobody
the
was
called
out
but
miss
melville
signified
by
a
look
that
gypsy
was
to
keep
her
seat
recess
came
but
miss
melville
was
busy
writing
at
her
desk
and
took
no
notice
of
her
further
than
to
tell
the
group
of
girls
who
had
instantly
clustered
buzzing
and
laughing
about
her
that
they
were
all
to
go
out
doors
and
play
they
went
and
gypsy
sat
still
with
her
head
behind
the
something
in
miss
manner
said
louder
than
words
that
she
was
displeased
it
was
a
manner
which
made
gypsy
feel
for
once
in
her
life
that
she
had
not
one
word
to
say
she
busied
herself
with
her
books
and
tried
to
look
unconcerned
when
the
scholars
came
back
the
arithmetic
class
recited
but
her
teacher
did
not
call
for
her
the
history
class
but
no
one
spoke
to
gypsy
the
disgrace
of
this
punishment
was
what
gypsy
minded
the
most
though
it
was
no
slight
thing
to
see
so
many
absent
marks
going
down
on
her
report
when
she
was
right
in
the
room
and
had
learned
her
lessons
after
what
seemed
to
her
an
interminable
time
the
morning
passed
and
the
school
broke
up
the
children
controlled
by
that
something
in
miss
melville
manner
and
by
gypsy
averted
head
and
burning
cheeks
left
the
room
quickly
and
gypsy
and
her
teacher
were
alone
gypsy
said
miss
melville
there
was
no
answer
gypsy
there
came
a
faint
yes
from
behind
the
miss
melville
laid
down
her
pencil
closed
her
own
desk
and
came
and
sat
down
on
the
bench
beside
gypsy
i
wonder
if
you
are
as
sorry
as
i
am
she
said
simply
something
very
bright
glittered
on
gypsy
lashes
and
two
great
drops
stood
on
her
hot
cheeks
i
do
see
what
possessed
me
she
said
vehemently
why
do
you
turn
me
out
of
school
i
did
not
think
you
could
willingly
try
to
make
me
trouble
continued
miss
melville
without
noticing
the
last
remark
the
two
great
drops
rolled
slowly
down
gypsy
cheeks
and
into
her
mouth
she
swallowed
them
with
a
gulp
and
brushed
her
hand
angrily
across
her
eyes
gypsy
very
seldom
cried
but
i
fancy
she
came
pretty
near
it
on
that
occasion
miss
melville
she
said
with
an
earnestness
that
was
comical
in
spite
of
itself
i
wish
you
please
to
scold
me
i
should
feel
a
great
deal
better
scoldings
wo
do
you
much
good
said
miss
melville
with
a
sad
smile
you
must
cure
your
own
faults
gypsy
nobody
else
can
do
it
for
you
gypsy
turned
around
in
a
little
passion
of
despair
miss
melville
it
is
in
me
you
do
know
here
this
very
morning
i
got
late
to
school
tipping
winnie
over
in
a
raft
drenched
through
both
of
us
and
mother
so
patient
and
sweet
with
the
dry
stockings
she
just
mended
and
was
i
sorry
did
i
think
about
it
all
the
way
to
school
the
whole
way
miss
melville
and
did
i
make
up
my
mind
i
be
as
good
as
a
kitten
all
day
and
sit
still
like
agnes
gaylord
and
not
tickle
the
girls
nor
make
you
any
trouble
nor
anything
then
what
should
i
do
but
come
into
the
entry
and
see
those
things
and
it
all
came
like
a
flash
how
funny
it
would
i
talk
up
high
like
surly
you
would
know
me
and
that
was
the
last
i
thought
till
you
took
off
the
veil
and
i
wished
i
had
done
it
it
just
like
me
i
never
can
help
anything
anyhow
i
think
you
can
said
her
teacher
kindly
you
certainly
had
the
power
when
you
stood
out
there
in
the
entry
to
stop
and
think
before
you
touched
the
things
i
do
know
said
gypsy
shaking
her
head
thoughtfully
i
believe
i
had
but
you
would
do
it
again
i
guess
i
would
said
gypsy
with
an
emphasis
what
you
can
do
one
time
you
can
another
said
miss
melville
gypsy
was
silent
there
one
other
thing
about
it
continued
her
teacher
besides
the
impropriety
of
playing
such
a
trick
in
school
hours
that
is
that
it
was
very
unkind
to
me
unkind
exclaimed
gypsy
yes
said
miss
melville
quietly
unkind
why
miss
melville
i
would
be
unkind
to
you
for
anything
i
love
you
dearly
nevertheless
gypsy
it
was
very
unkind
to
deliberately
set
to
work
to
annoy
me
and
make
me
trouble
by
getting
the
school
into
a
frolic
anything
done
to
break
the
order
of
or
to
withstand
any
rule
of
the
school
is
always
an
unkindness
to
a
teacher
there
is
scarcely
a
girl
in
school
that
might
help
me
more
than
you
gypsy
if
you
chose
i
do
see
how
said
gypsy
astonished
i
do
said
miss
melville
smiling
and
i
always
think
a
little
vote
of
thanks
to
you
when
you
are
quiet
and
an
orderly
scholar
has
a
great
deal
of
influence
the
girls
all
love
you
and
are
apt
to
do
as
they
see
you
do
gypsy
there
was
a
little
silence
in
which
gypsy
eyes
were
wandering
away
under
the
their
twinkling
dimmed
and
soft
at
last
she
turned
quickly
and
threw
her
arms
about
her
teacher
neck
miss
melville
if
you
give
me
one
kiss
i
never
be
an
old
woman
again
if
i
live
as
long
as
methuselah
miss
melville
kissed
her
and
whispered
one
or
two
little
loving
words
of
encouragement
such
as
nobody
but
miss
melville
knew
how
to
say
but
gypsy
never
told
what
they
were
i
believe
there
a
bolt
left
out
of
me
somewhere
she
said
as
they
left
the
together
what
do
you
suppose
it
is
it
is
the
strong
iron
bolt
and
gypsy
um
yes
perhaps
it
is
said
gypsy
and
walked
slowly
home
chapter
iv
gypsy
has
a
dream
come
tom
do
do
what
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
what
did
you
observe
tom
breynton
that
my
name
will
you
or
will
you
not
come
down
to
the
pond
and
have
a
row
let
hear
you
tease
a
little
catch
me
if
you
wo
come
for
a
civil
request
i
wo
tease
for
it
very
good
said
tom
laying
aside
his
euclid
i
like
your
spunk
rather
think
i
go
tom
tossed
on
his
cap
and
was
ready
gypsy
hurried
away
to
array
herself
in
the
complication
of
garments
necessary
to
the
feminine
adventurer
if
she
so
much
as
crosses
the
yard
a
continual
mystery
of
providence
was
this
little
necessity
to
gypsy
and
one
against
which
she
lived
in
a
state
of
incessant
rebellion
it
was
provoking
enough
to
stand
there
in
her
room
tugging
and
hurrying
till
she
was
red
in
the
face
over
a
pair
of
utterly
heartless
and
unimpressible
rubbers
that
absolutely
refused
to
slip
over
the
heel
of
her
boot
and
to
see
tom
through
the
window
with
his
hands
in
his
pocket
ready
waiting
and
impatient
alternately
whistling
and
calling
for
her
i
never
said
gypsy
in
no
very
gentle
tone
hur
ry
up
called
tom
coolly
these
old
rubbers
said
gypsy
what
the
matter
asked
her
mother
stopping
at
the
door
it
enough
to
try
the
patience
of
a
saint
said
gypsy
emphatically
holding
out
her
foot
perhaps
i
can
help
you
said
breynton
stooping
down
why
gypsy
your
boots
are
wet
through
of
course
the
rubbers
wo
go
on
i
did
suppose
that
would
make
any
difference
said
gypsy
looking
rather
foolish
i
got
them
wet
this
morning
down
at
the
swamp
i
thought
they
were
dry
though
i
sat
with
my
feet
in
the
oven
until
patty
drove
me
off
she
said
i
was
in
the
bread
you
will
have
to
put
on
your
best
boots
said
her
mother
oh
tom
called
gypsy
in
despair
as
the
shrillest
of
all
shrill
whistles
came
up
through
the
window
everything
in
a
jumble
i
be
there
as
soon
as
i
can
she
changed
her
boots
tossed
on
her
turban
whisked
on
her
sack
and
began
to
fasten
it
with
a
jerk
when
off
came
the
button
at
the
throat
and
rolled
maliciously
quite
out
of
sight
under
the
bed
there
said
gypsy
ca
wait
shouted
tom
i
mended
that
sack
said
gypsy
only
yesterday
afternoon
i
call
it
too
bad
when
a
body
trying
to
keep
their
things
in
order
and
do
up
all
their
mending
that
things
have
to
act
so
i
think
you
have
been
trying
to
be
orderly
said
her
mother
helping
her
to
pin
the
offending
sack
about
the
throat
for
there
was
no
time
now
to
restore
the
wandering
button
i
have
noticed
a
great
improvement
in
you
but
there
one
thing
wanting
yet
that
would
have
kept
the
button
in
its
place
and
had
the
boots
properly
taken
off
and
dried
at
the
right
time
what
that
asked
gypsy
in
a
great
hurry
to
go
a
little
more
gypsy
this
bit
of
a
lesson
like
most
of
breynton
moral
teachings
was
enforced
with
a
little
soft
kiss
on
gypsy
forehead
and
a
smile
that
was
as
unlike
a
sermon
as
smile
could
be
gypsy
gave
two
thoughts
to
it
while
she
jumped
down
stairs
three
steps
at
a
time
then
it
must
be
confessed
she
forgot
it
entirely
in
the
sight
of
tom
coolly
walking
off
down
the
lane
without
her
but
words
that
breynton
said
with
a
kiss
did
not
slip
away
from
gypsy
memory
for
good
an
a
as
easily
as
that
she
had
her
own
little
places
and
times
of
private
meditation
when
such
things
came
up
to
her
like
faithful
angels
that
are
always
ready
to
speak
if
you
give
them
the
chance
tom
was
still
in
sight
among
the
bushes
and
budding
of
the
lane
and
gypsy
ran
swiftly
after
him
she
was
fleet
of
foot
as
a
young
gazelle
and
soon
overtook
him
she
had
just
stopped
panting
by
his
side
and
was
proceeding
to
make
some
remarks
which
she
thought
his
conduct
richly
deserved
when
the
sound
of
some
little
trotting
feet
behind
them
attracted
their
attention
why
winnie
breynton
said
gypsy
where
are
you
going
asked
tom
turning
round
oh
nowheres
in
particular
said
winnie
with
an
absent
air
well
you
may
just
turn
round
and
go
there
then
said
tom
we
want
any
little
boys
with
us
this
afternoon
boys
said
winnie
with
a
terrible
look
i
five
years
old
sir
i
can
button
my
own
jacket
and
i
got
a
snowshovel
tom
walked
rapidly
on
and
gypsy
with
him
a
moment
reflection
seemed
to
convince
winnie
that
his
company
was
not
wanted
and
he
disappeared
among
the
hazel
nut
bushes
gypsy
and
tom
were
fast
walkers
and
they
reached
the
pond
in
a
marvellously
short
time
this
pond
was
about
a
from
the
house
just
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
which
went
by
the
name
of
kleiner
berg
a
german
word
meaning
little
mountain
there
were
many
of
these
elevations
all
along
the
valley
in
which
yorkbury
was
situated
they
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
to
the
great
mountains
that
towered
sharply
beyond
the
pond
that
nestled
in
among
the
trees
at
the
foot
of
the
kleiner
berg
was
called
the
kleiner
berg
basin
it
was
a
beautiful
sheet
of
water
small
and
still
and
sheltered
and
a
great
resort
of
because
of
the
clouds
of
white
and
golden
lilies
that
floated
over
it
in
the
hot
summer
months
breynton
owned
a
boat
there
which
was
kept
locked
to
a
tiny
wharf
under
the
trees
and
was
very
often
used
by
the
children
although
tom
declared
it
was
no
better
to
fish
in
than
a
as
a
vermont
boy
used
to
the
up
among
the
mountains
would
be
likely
to
think
what
that
asked
gypsy
as
they
neared
the
wharf
looks
as
much
like
a
little
green
monkey
as
anything
said
tom
making
a
tube
of
his
hands
to
look
through
it
in
the
boat
whatever
it
is
it
a
gingham
monkey
said
gypsy
suddenly
with
a
belt
and
brown
pants
and
a
cap
on
wrong
side
before
the
little
he
may
just
walk
home
anyhow
observed
tom
in
his
autocratic
style
he
ought
to
be
taught
better
than
to
come
where
older
people
are
especially
if
they
do
want
him
i
suppose
he
likes
to
have
a
as
well
as
we
do
suggested
gypsy
winthrop
called
tom
severely
winnie
chin
was
on
his
little
fat
hand
and
winnie
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
water
and
winnie
was
altogether
too
deeply
absorbed
in
meditation
to
deign
a
reply
winnie
where
did
you
come
from
oh
said
winnie
looking
up
carelessly
that
you
how
did
you
get
down
here
i
like
to
know
said
gypsy
winnie
regarded
her
impressively
as
if
to
signify
that
his
principles
of
action
were
his
own
until
they
were
made
public
and
when
they
were
made
public
she
might
have
them
you
may
just
get
out
of
that
boat
said
tom
rather
crossly
for
him
winnie
hinted
as
if
it
were
quite
an
accidental
remark
that
he
had
no
intention
of
doing
so
he
furthermore
observed
that
he
would
be
happy
to
take
them
to
row
father
said
whoever
took
the
boat
first
was
to
have
it
tom
replied
by
taking
him
up
in
one
hand
twisting
him
over
his
shoulder
and
landing
him
upon
the
grass
at
this
winnie
as
characteristic
in
his
wrath
as
in
his
dignity
threw
himself
flat
and
began
to
scream
after
his
usual
musical
fashion
it
too
bad
said
gypsy
let
him
go
tom
do
he
should
have
stayed
where
he
was
told
to
argued
tom
who
like
most
boys
of
his
age
had
a
sufficiently
just
estimate
of
the
importance
of
his
own
authority
and
who
would
sometimes
do
a
very
selfish
thing
under
the
impression
that
it
was
his
duty
to
family
and
state
as
an
individual
and
citizen
i
know
it
is
so
pleasant
to
have
him
said
gypsy
but
it
does
make
him
so
dreadfully
happy
that
was
the
best
of
gypsy
she
was
as
generous
a
child
as
poor
fallen
children
of
adam
are
apt
to
be
as
quick
to
do
right
as
she
was
to
do
wrong
and
much
given
to
this
fancy
of
seeing
people
dreadfully
happy
i
have
said
that
people
loved
gypsy
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
herein
lay
the
secret
of
it
then
gypsy
never
preached
if
she
happened
to
be
right
and
another
person
wrong
she
never
put
on
superior
airs
and
tried
to
patronize
them
into
becoming
as
good
as
she
was
she
made
her
suggestions
in
such
a
straightforward
way
as
if
of
course
you
thought
so
too
and
she
was
only
agreeing
with
you
and
was
apt
to
make
them
so
merrily
withal
that
there
was
no
resisting
her
therefore
tom
while
pretending
to
carry
his
point
really
yielded
to
the
influence
of
gypsy
kind
feeling
in
saying
on
the
whole
winnie
i
come
to
the
conclusion
to
take
you
on
condition
that
you
always
do
as
i
tell
you
in
future
and
if
you
stop
crying
this
minute
you
go
this
rather
ungracious
consent
was
sufficient
to
dry
winnie
tears
and
silence
winnie
lungs
and
the
three
seated
themselves
in
the
little
boat
and
started
off
in
high
spirits
it
was
a
light
pretty
boat
painted
in
bright
colors
and
christened
it
being
an
appropriate
and
respectful
title
for
a
boat
on
the
kleiner
berg
moreover
the
air
was
as
sweet
as
a
and
as
warm
as
sunshine
there
was
a
soft
blue
sky
with
clouds
of
silver
like
stately
ships
sailing
over
it
and
such
a
shimmering
bright
photograph
of
it
in
the
water
then
tom
was
so
pleasant
and
rowed
so
fast
and
let
gypsy
help
and
she
could
keep
time
with
him
and
the
spray
dashed
up
like
about
the
oars
and
the
bees
were
humming
among
the
buds
on
the
trees
and
the
blue
that
skipped
from
ripple
to
ripple
seemed
to
be
having
such
a
holiday
altogether
gypsy
felt
like
saying
with
famous
little
prudy
oh
i
so
glad
there
happened
to
be
a
world
and
god
made
me
after
a
while
tom
laid
down
his
oars
and
they
floated
idly
back
and
forth
among
the
and
the
soft
purple
shadows
of
the
from
which
the
perfumed
scarlet
blossoms
dropped
like
coral
into
the
water
tom
took
off
his
cap
and
leaned
lazily
against
the
side
of
the
boat
winnie
interested
in
making
a
series
of
remarkable
faces
at
himself
in
the
water
for
a
wonder
sat
still
and
gypsy
lay
down
across
two
seats
with
her
face
turned
up
watching
the
sky
it
was
very
pleasant
and
no
one
seemed
inclined
to
talk
i
wish
i
were
a
cloud
said
gypsy
suddenly
after
a
long
silence
a
little
white
cloud
with
a
silver
fringe
and
not
have
anything
to
do
but
float
round
all
day
in
the
sunshine
no
lessons
nor
torn
dresses
nor
hateful
old
sewing
to
do
it
suggested
winnie
you
might
get
striked
that
would
be
fun
said
gypsy
laughing
i
always
wanted
to
see
where
the
lightning
came
from
supposing
there
came
a
wind
and
blew
you
away
suggested
tom
sleepily
i
never
thought
of
that
said
gypsy
i
guess
i
rather
do
the
sewing
presently
a
little
scarlet
floated
out
on
the
wind
and
dropped
right
into
gypsy
mouth
which
most
unpoetically
happened
to
be
open
just
think
said
gypsy
whose
thoughts
seemed
to
have
taken
a
metaphysical
turn
of
being
a
little
red
flower
that
dies
and
drops
into
the
water
and
there
never
any
fruit
nor
anything
i
wonder
what
it
was
made
for
perhaps
just
to
make
you
ask
that
question
answered
tom
and
there
was
a
great
deal
more
in
the
answer
than
tom
himself
supposed
this
was
every
solitary
word
that
was
said
on
that
a
little
is
so
much
better
than
much
sometimes
and
goes
a
great
deal
further
it
seemed
to
gypsy
the
pleasantest
she
had
ever
taken
but
tom
became
tired
of
it
before
she
did
and
went
up
to
the
house
carrying
winnie
with
him
gypsy
stayed
a
little
while
to
row
by
herself
be
sure
you
lock
the
boat
when
you
come
up
called
tom
in
starting
oh
yes
said
gypsy
i
always
do
did
you
bring
up
the
oars
asked
tom
at
supper
yes
they
in
the
barn
i
do
sometimes
remember
things
mr
tom
did
you
began
tom
again
but
winnie
just
then
upset
the
entire
contents
of
his
silver
mug
of
milk
exactly
into
tom
lap
and
as
this
was
the
fourth
time
the
young
gentleman
had
done
that
very
thing
within
three
days
tom
sentence
was
broken
off
for
another
of
a
more
agitated
nature
that
night
tom
had
a
dream
he
thought
the
house
was
a
haunted
castle
he
had
i
am
sorry
to
say
been
reading
novels
in
study
hours
and
that
the
ghost
of
old
baron
somebody
who
had
defrauded
the
beautiful
lady
of
kleiner
berg
basin
and
the
dipper
in
which
it
was
supposed
surly
had
secreted
a
blind
kitten
which
it
was
somehow
or
other
imperatively
necessary
should
be
drowned
for
the
of
the
beautiful
and
unfortunate
heiress
that
the
ghost
of
this
atrocious
baron
was
going
down
stairs
with
white
silk
stockings
on
his
feet
and
a
tin
pan
on
his
head
at
this
crisis
tom
awoke
with
a
jump
and
heard
or
thought
he
heard
a
slight
creaking
noise
in
the
entry
winnie
cat
of
course
or
the
wind
rattling
the
blinds
nevertheless
tom
went
to
his
door
and
looked
out
he
was
exceedingly
sleepy
and
the
entry
was
exceedingly
dark
and
though
he
had
not
a
breath
of
faith
in
ghosts
not
he
was
there
ever
a
boy
who
had
and
though
he
considered
such
persons
as
had
as
candidates
for
the
state
idiot
asylum
yet
it
must
be
confessed
that
even
tom
was
possessed
of
an
imagination
and
this
imagination
certainly
for
an
instant
deluded
him
into
the
belief
that
a
dim
figure
was
flitting
down
stairs
who
there
said
tom
rather
faintly
there
was
no
reply
a
curious
sound
like
the
lifting
of
a
distant
latch
by
phantom
fingers
fell
upon
his
ear
then
all
was
still
stuff
and
nonsense
said
tom
nevertheless
tom
went
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
looked
down
went
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
looked
around
the
doors
were
all
closed
as
they
had
been
left
for
the
night
nothing
was
to
be
seen
nothing
was
to
be
heard
curious
mental
delusions
one
will
have
when
one
is
sleepy
said
tom
and
went
back
to
bed
where
the
reader
is
confidentially
informed
he
lay
for
fifteen
entire
minutes
with
his
eyes
wide
open
speculating
on
the
proportion
of
authenticated
to
be
sure
there
had
been
some
it
was
perhaps
foolish
to
deny
as
much
as
that
after
which
he
slept
the
rest
of
the
night
as
soundly
as
young
people
of
sixteen
who
are
well
and
happy
are
apt
to
sleep
that
night
also
gypsy
had
a
dream
she
dreamed
that
miss
melville
sailed
in
through
the
window
on
an
oar
which
she
paddled
through
the
air
with
a
parasol
and
told
her
that
her
gypsy
father
had
been
hung
upon
a
by
senator
sumner
for
advocating
the
coercion
of
the
seceded
states
and
that
tom
had
set
winnie
afloat
on
the
kleiner
berg
basin
in
a
winnie
had
tipped
over
and
was
in
imminent
danger
of
drowning
if
indeed
he
were
not
past
hope
already
and
tom
sat
up
in
the
laughing
at
him
her
mother
appeared
to
have
enlisted
in
the
union
army
and
her
father
being
detained
in
that
characteristic
manner
by
sumner
there
was
evidently
nothing
to
be
done
but
for
gypsy
to
go
to
winnie
relief
this
she
hastened
to
do
with
all
possible
speed
she
dressed
herself
under
a
remarkable
sense
of
not
being
able
to
find
any
buttons
and
of
getting
all
her
sleeves
upon
the
wrong
arm
she
put
on
her
because
it
took
so
long
to
lace
up
her
boots
her
stockings
she
wore
upon
her
arms
the
reason
appeared
to
be
that
she
might
not
get
her
hands
wet
in
pulling
winnie
out
she
stopped
to
put
on
her
sack
her
turban
and
her
blue
veil
she
also
spent
considerable
time
in
commendable
efforts
to
pin
on
a
lace
collar
which
utterly
refused
to
be
pinned
and
to
fasten
at
her
throat
a
velvet
bow
that
kept
turning
into
a
little
green
snake
and
twisting
round
her
fingers
when
at
length
she
was
fairly
ready
she
left
the
house
softly
under
the
impression
that
tom
who
appeared
to
have
the
remarkable
capacity
of
being
in
the
house
and
down
in
the
at
one
and
the
same
time
would
stop
her
if
he
heard
her
she
ran
down
the
lane
and
over
the
fields
and
into
the
woods
where
the
kleiner
berg
rose
darkly
in
front
of
her
so
at
last
to
the
basin
which
rippled
and
washed
on
its
shore
and
tossed
up
at
her
feet
empty
a
horrible
fear
seized
her
she
had
come
too
late
winnie
was
drowned
it
was
all
owing
to
that
lace
collar
she
sprang
into
the
boat
she
floated
away
she
peered
down
into
the
dark
water
but
tom
laughed
in
the
and
there
was
no
sign
nor
sound
of
winnie
she
cried
out
with
a
loud
cry
and
awoke
she
lifted
up
her
head
and
saw
chapter
v
what
she
saw
a
great
solemn
stretch
of
sky
alive
with
stars
a
sheet
of
silent
water
a
long
line
of
silent
hills
had
acted
out
her
dream
when
the
truth
came
to
gypsy
she
sat
for
a
moment
like
one
stunned
the
terrible
sense
of
awakening
in
a
desolate
place
at
midnight
and
alone
instead
of
in
a
safe
and
quiet
bed
with
bolted
doors
and
friends
within
the
slightest
call
might
well
alarm
an
older
and
stouter
heart
than
gypsy
the
consciousness
of
having
wandered
she
did
not
know
whither
she
did
not
know
how
in
the
helplessness
of
sleep
into
a
place
where
her
voice
could
reach
no
human
ear
was
in
itself
enough
to
freeze
her
where
she
sat
with
hands
locked
and
wide
frightened
eyes
staring
into
the
darkness
after
a
few
moments
she
stirred
shivered
a
little
and
looked
about
her
it
was
the
basin
surely
there
were
the
maples
there
was
the
kleiner
berg
rolling
up
soft
and
shadowy
among
its
pines
there
were
the
mountains
towering
and
sharp
terrible
shadows
against
the
sky
here
too
was
the
dipper
beneath
her
swaying
idly
back
and
forth
upon
the
water
she
remembered
with
a
little
cry
of
joy
that
the
boat
was
always
locked
she
could
not
have
stirred
from
the
shore
it
would
be
but
the
work
of
a
moment
to
jump
upon
the
wharf
then
back
swiftly
through
the
fields
to
the
house
she
looked
back
the
wharf
was
not
in
sight
a
dark
distance
lay
between
her
and
it
the
beds
of
and
the
dropping
blossoms
of
the
maples
were
about
her
on
every
side
she
had
drifted
half
across
the
pond
she
understood
it
all
in
a
moment
had
not
locked
the
boat
that
what
was
to
be
done
the
oars
were
half
a
mile
away
in
the
barn
at
home
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
branch
floating
within
reach
on
the
water
she
tried
to
pull
up
the
board
seats
of
the
boat
under
the
impression
that
she
could
by
degrees
paddle
herself
ashore
with
one
of
them
but
they
were
nailed
tightly
in
their
places
and
she
could
not
stir
them
evidently
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
perhaps
the
boat
would
drift
ashore
somewhere
she
could
land
anywhere
even
on
the
steep
kleiner
berg
side
she
could
easily
have
found
footing
she
was
well
used
to
climbing
its
narrow
ledges
and
knew
every
crack
and
crevice
and
projection
where
a
step
could
be
taken
but
no
the
boat
was
not
going
to
drift
ashore
it
had
stopped
in
a
tangle
of
far
out
in
the
water
and
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
to
stir
it
if
the
water
had
not
been
deep
she
could
have
waded
ashore
but
her
practised
ear
told
her
from
the
sound
of
the
little
waves
against
her
hand
that
wading
was
not
to
be
thought
of
to
be
sure
gypsy
could
swim
but
a
walk
of
half
a
mile
in
drenched
clothes
was
hardly
preferable
to
sitting
still
in
a
dry
boat
to
say
nothing
of
the
inconvenience
of
swimming
in
crinoline
and
on
a
dark
night
no
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
sit
still
till
morning
having
come
to
this
conclusion
gypsy
gave
another
little
shiver
and
slipped
down
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
thinking
she
might
lie
with
her
head
under
the
and
thus
be
somewhat
shielded
from
the
chilly
air
in
turning
up
her
to
protect
her
throat
she
touched
something
soft
which
proved
to
be
the
lace
collar
this
led
her
to
examine
her
dress
she
now
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
one
stocking
was
drawn
up
over
her
hand
the
other
she
had
probably
lost
on
the
way
and
that
she
had
put
her
bare
feet
into
the
lace
collar
was
fastened
by
a
bit
of
green
chenille
she
sometimes
wore
at
her
throat
and
which
had
doubtless
been
the
snake
of
her
dream
lonely
frightened
and
cold
as
she
was
gypsy
sense
of
the
ludicrous
overcame
her
at
that
and
she
broke
into
a
little
laugh
that
laugh
seemed
to
drive
away
the
mystery
and
terror
of
her
situation
in
spite
of
the
curious
sound
it
had
in
echoing
over
the
lonely
water
and
gypsy
set
herself
to
work
with
her
usual
good
sense
to
see
how
matters
stood
in
the
first
place
she
reasoned
talking
half
aloud
for
the
sake
of
the
company
of
her
own
voice
i
had
a
fit
of
what
the
dictionary
calls
somnambulism
i
suppose
i
eat
too
much
after
supper
and
the
whole
of
it
it
always
makes
me
dream
only
i
never
was
goose
enough
to
get
out
of
bed
before
and
i
rather
think
it
be
some
time
before
i
do
again
i
came
down
stairs
softly
and
out
of
the
back
door
nobody
heard
me
and
of
course
nobody
will
hear
me
till
morning
and
i
in
a
pretty
fix
if
i
had
forgotten
to
lock
the
boat
i
should
be
back
in
bed
by
this
time
oh
dear
i
wish
i
were
however
i
too
large
to
tip
myself
over
and
get
drowned
and
i
could
get
hurt
any
other
way
and
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
if
i
do
have
to
stay
here
till
morning
except
sore
throat
so
there
no
great
harm
done
the
worst
of
it
is
that
old
tom
wo
he
laugh
at
me
about
the
boat
i
never
expect
to
hear
the
end
of
it
then
when
they
go
to
my
room
and
find
me
gone
in
the
morning
they
be
frightened
i
rather
sorry
for
that
i
wish
i
knew
what
time
it
is
just
then
the
distant
struck
two
gypsy
held
her
breath
and
listened
to
it
it
had
a
singular
solemn
sound
she
had
never
heard
the
clock
strike
two
in
the
morning
but
once
before
in
her
life
that
was
once
when
she
was
very
small
when
her
father
was
dangerously
sick
and
the
coming
of
the
doctor
had
wakened
her
she
had
always
somehow
associated
the
hour
with
mysterious
flickering
lights
and
anxious
whispers
and
softened
steps
and
a
dread
as
terrible
as
it
was
undefined
now
out
here
in
this
desolate
place
where
the
birds
were
asleep
in
their
nests
and
the
winds
quiet
among
the
and
the
very
frogs
tired
of
their
chanting
herself
the
only
waking
thing
these
two
far
syllables
seemed
like
a
human
voice
like
the
voice
gypsy
fancied
of
some
one
imprisoned
for
years
in
the
belfry
and
crying
to
get
out
two
three
four
five
six
at
about
six
they
would
begin
to
miss
her
her
mother
always
called
her
then
to
get
up
four
hours
hum
well
said
gypsy
drawing
her
closer
pretty
long
time
to
sit
out
in
a
boat
and
shiver
it
might
be
worse
though
just
then
her
foot
struck
something
soft
under
the
seat
she
pulled
it
out
and
found
it
to
be
an
old
coat
of
tom
which
he
sometimes
used
for
boating
fortunately
it
was
not
wet
for
the
boat
was
new
and
did
not
leak
she
wrapped
it
closely
around
her
shoulders
curled
herself
up
snugly
in
the
stern
and
presently
pronounced
herself
as
warm
as
toast
and
as
comfortable
as
an
oyster
then
she
began
to
look
about
her
all
around
and
underneath
her
lay
the
black
still
water
so
black
that
the
cast
no
shadow
on
it
about
and
above
her
rose
the
mountains
grim
and
mute
and
watching
as
they
had
watched
for
ages
and
would
watch
for
ages
still
all
the
long
night
through
overhead
the
stars
glittered
and
throbbed
and
shot
in
and
out
of
ragged
clouds
far
up
in
the
great
forests
that
climbed
the
the
wind
was
muttering
like
an
angry
voice
somehow
it
made
gypsy
sit
very
still
she
thought
if
she
were
a
poet
she
would
write
some
verses
just
then
indeed
if
she
had
had
a
pencil
i
am
not
sure
but
she
would
have
as
it
was
then
some
other
thoughts
came
to
gypsy
she
wondered
why
of
all
places
she
chanced
to
come
to
the
basin
in
her
dream
she
might
have
gone
to
the
and
been
caught
and
whirred
to
death
in
the
machinery
she
might
have
gone
to
the
bridge
over
the
river
and
thrown
herself
off
not
knowing
what
she
did
or
what
if
the
pond
had
been
a
river
and
she
were
now
floating
away
helpless
out
of
reach
of
any
who
came
to
save
her
to
some
dam
where
the
water
roared
and
splashed
on
cruel
rocks
or
she
might
in
her
dream
have
tipped
over
the
boat
where
the
water
was
deep
and
been
unable
to
swim
encumbered
by
her
clothing
then
she
might
have
been
such
a
girl
as
sarah
rowe
who
would
have
suffered
agonies
of
fright
at
waking
to
find
herself
in
such
a
place
but
she
had
been
led
to
the
quiet
familiar
basin
and
no
harm
had
come
to
her
and
she
had
good
strong
nerves
and
lost
all
her
fear
in
five
minutes
so
that
the
mischance
would
end
only
in
an
exciting
adventure
which
would
give
her
something
to
talk
about
as
long
as
she
lived
well
she
was
sure
she
was
very
thankful
to
whom
and
gypsy
bowed
her
head
a
little
at
the
question
and
she
sat
a
moment
very
still
then
she
had
other
thoughts
she
looked
up
at
the
shadowed
mountains
and
thought
how
year
after
year
summer
and
winter
day
and
night
those
terrible
masses
of
rock
had
cleaved
together
and
stood
still
and
caught
the
rains
and
the
snows
and
vapors
the
golden
crowns
of
sunsets
and
sunrisings
the
cooling
winds
and
mellow
moonlights
and
done
all
their
work
of
beauty
and
of
use
and
done
it
aright
not
one
faileth
no
avalanche
had
thundered
down
their
sides
destroying
such
happy
homes
as
hers
no
volcanic
fires
had
torn
them
into
seething
lava
no
beetling
precipice
of
which
she
ever
heard
had
fallen
and
crushed
so
much
as
the
sheep
feeding
in
the
valleys
to
the
power
of
the
hills
as
to
the
power
of
the
seas
someone
had
said
thus
far
shalt
thou
go
and
no
farther
and
the
hand
that
could
uphold
a
mountain
in
its
place
was
the
hand
that
had
guided
her
one
little
foolish
helpless
girl
out
of
millions
and
millions
of
creatures
for
whom
he
was
caring
in
the
wanderings
of
an
uneasy
sleep
that
night
there
was
a
great
awe
and
a
great
joy
in
this
thought
but
sharp
upon
it
came
another
as
a
pleasure
is
followed
by
a
sudden
pain
a
thought
that
came
all
unbidden
and
talked
with
gypsy
and
would
not
go
away
it
was
that
she
had
gone
to
bed
that
night
without
a
prayer
she
was
tired
and
sleepy
and
the
lamp
went
out
and
so
and
so
well
she
did
know
exactly
how
it
came
about
gypsy
bowed
head
fell
into
her
hands
and
there
crouched
in
the
lonely
boat
under
the
lonely
sky
she
put
this
thought
into
a
few
whispered
words
and
i
know
there
was
one
to
hear
it
other
thoughts
had
gypsy
after
this
but
they
were
those
she
could
not
have
put
into
words
for
three
of
those
solemn
human
syllables
had
sounded
from
the
distant
clock
and
far
over
the
the
sweet
summer
dawn
was
coming
gypsy
had
never
seen
the
sun
rise
she
had
seen
to
be
sure
many
times
the
late
winter
painting
of
crimson
and
gold
in
the
east
which
unfolded
itself
before
her
window
and
chased
away
her
dreams
but
she
had
never
watched
that
slow
mysterious
change
from
midnight
to
morning
which
is
the
only
spectacle
that
can
properly
be
called
a
sunrise
there
was
something
in
gypsy
that
made
her
sit
like
a
statue
there
wrapped
in
tom
old
coat
her
face
upturned
and
her
very
breath
held
in
as
the
heavy
shadows
softened
and
melted
and
the
stars
began
to
dim
in
a
pale
gray
light
that
fell
and
folded
in
the
earth
like
a
mist
as
the
clouds
that
floated
faintly
over
the
mountains
blushed
pink
from
the
touch
of
an
unseen
sun
as
the
pink
deepened
into
crimson
and
the
crimson
burned
to
fire
and
the
outlines
of
the
mountains
were
cut
in
gold
as
the
gold
broadened
and
brightened
and
stole
over
the
ragged
peaks
and
shot
down
among
the
forests
and
filtered
through
the
and
chased
the
purple
shadows
far
down
among
the
valleys
as
the
birds
twittered
in
unseen
nests
and
the
crickets
chirped
in
the
meadows
and
the
dews
fell
and
sparkled
from
nodding
grasses
and
all
the
world
grew
green
again
gypsy
thought
it
was
worth
an
ugly
dream
and
a
little
fright
to
see
such
a
sight
she
wondered
if
those
old
pictures
of
the
great
masters
far
away
over
the
sea
of
which
she
had
heard
so
much
were
anything
like
it
she
also
had
a
faint
flitting
notion
that
in
a
world
where
there
were
sunrises
every
day
it
was
very
strange
people
should
ever
be
cross
and
tear
their
dresses
and
forget
to
lock
boats
it
seemed
as
if
they
ought
to
know
better
just
then
gypsy
fell
asleep
with
her
head
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
the
next
she
knew
it
was
broad
day
and
a
dear
familiar
voice
from
somewhere
was
calling
gypsy
why
gypsy
how
do
you
do
said
gypsy
sleepily
sitting
up
straight
tom
was
standing
on
the
shore
he
did
not
say
another
word
he
jumped
into
an
old
that
lay
floating
among
the
bushes
and
paddled
up
to
her
before
she
was
wide
enough
awake
to
speak
why
gypsy
breynton
i
been
walking
in
my
sleep
said
gypsy
with
a
little
laugh
i
came
out
here
to
save
winnie
from
upsetting
in
a
and
then
i
woke
up
and
i
forget
to
lock
the
boat
and
i
could
get
ashore
how
long
have
you
been
here
tom
was
very
pale
since
a
little
before
two
there
was
a
splendid
sunrise
only
it
was
rather
cold
and
i
did
know
where
i
was
at
first
and
i
well
i
glad
you
come
put
on
my
coat
over
that
lean
up
against
my
arm
so
do
try
to
talk
said
tom
in
a
quick
tone
but
tom
was
curiously
pale
why
there
no
harm
done
tom
dear
said
gypsy
looking
up
into
his
face
i
ca
talk
about
it
gypsy
i
i
thought
i
tom
looked
the
other
way
to
see
the
view
and
did
not
finish
his
sentence
you
do
suppose
she
going
to
be
a
somnambulist
asked
breynton
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
remembered
to
be
worried
over
any
of
gypsy
peculiarities
all
day
he
had
spent
so
much
time
in
looking
at
her
and
kissing
her
and
wiping
his
spectacles
no
indeed
said
her
mother
it
was
nothing
in
the
world
but
the
child
will
never
have
another
such
turn
i
venture
and
she
never
did
it
is
needless
to
say
that
nobody
scolded
gypsy
for
forgetting
to
lock
the
boat
she
was
likely
enough
to
remember
the
incident
she
had
perhaps
received
a
severe
punishment
for
so
slight
a
negligence
but
the
reader
may
rest
assured
that
the
boat
was
always
locked
thereafter
when
gypsy
had
anything
to
do
with
it
chapter
vi
up
in
the
apple
tree
gypsy
gypsy
what
wanted
where
are
you
here
i
do
know
where
is
well
you
find
out
after
a
while
winnie
trotted
along
down
the
and
across
the
brook
here
proved
to
be
the
great
tree
high
up
on
a
gnarled
old
branch
there
was
a
little
flutter
of
a
crimson
and
white
gingham
dress
and
a
merry
face
peeping
down
through
the
dainty
pink
blossoms
that
blushed
all
over
the
tree
it
looked
so
pretty
framed
in
by
the
bright
color
and
glistening
sunlight
and
it
seemed
to
fit
in
so
exactly
with
the
fragrance
and
the
soft
dropping
petals
and
the
chirping
of
the
overhead
that
i
doubt
if
even
surly
would
have
had
the
heart
to
say
as
surly
was
much
in
the
habit
of
saying
a
young
lady
twelve
years
old
climbing
an
laws
a
massy
i
pity
your
ma
what
a
sight
of
she
must
ha
wasted
on
you
it
looks
nice
up
there
said
winnie
admiringly
looking
up
with
his
mouth
open
i
up
very
well
said
gypsy
winnie
assailed
a
bough
and
crawled
half
way
up
where
he
stopped
why
do
you
come
said
gypsy
oh
i
well
i
think
i
like
it
better
down
here
you
can
see
the
grass
and
things
there
a
black
grasshopper
here
too
what
do
you
want
anyway
asked
gypsy
taking
a
few
spasmodic
stitches
on
a
long
white
seam
i
busy
i
ca
talk
to
little
boys
when
sewing
oh
i
guess
i
do
want
very
much
said
winnie
folding
his
arms
composedly
as
if
he
had
seated
himself
for
the
day
i
five
years
old
down
went
gypsy
work
and
a
whole
handful
of
pink
and
white
blossoms
came
fluttering
into
winnie
eyes
how
am
i
going
to
sew
said
gypsy
despairingly
you
so
exactly
in
the
right
place
to
be
hit
i
do
believe
surly
herself
could
help
snowballing
you
surly
snowball
why
i
never
saw
her
would
it
be
just
funny
winnie
breynton
you
please
to
go
away
i
say
gypsy
if
you
cut
off
a
grasshopper
wings
and
frow
him
in
a
what
would
he
do
remarked
winnie
inclining
to
metaphysics
as
was
winnie
custom
when
he
was
wanted
gypsy
took
several
severe
stitches
and
made
no
answer
gypsy
if
somebody
builded
a
fire
inside
of
me
and
made
steam
could
i
draw
a
train
of
cars
look
here
when
a
cat
eats
up
a
mouse
winnie
forgot
what
he
was
aiming
at
just
there
coughed
and
began
again
samson
could
have
drawed
a
train
of
cars
anyway
oh
winnie
breynton
well
if
he
had
a
he
be
jest
as
good
as
an
engine
i
like
to
seen
him
just
then
a
branch
struck
head
with
decidedly
more
emphasis
than
the
handful
of
blossoms
and
winnie
slid
to
the
ground
and
remarked
with
dignity
that
he
was
sorry
he
could
stay
longer
he
would
come
again
another
day
about
half
way
up
the
walk
he
stopped
and
turned
leisurely
round
oh
gypsy
mother
want
to
know
where
the
key
of
the
she
let
you
have
she
in
a
great
hurry
that
what
i
come
down
for
i
there
was
something
or
nuther
why
winnie
breynton
and
you
been
sitting
there
all
this
where
the
key
interrupted
winnie
severely
mother
had
ought
to
be
kept
it
in
in
i
guess
in
my
slippers
said
gypsy
stopping
to
think
slippers
yes
i
was
afraid
i
should
forget
to
put
it
up
so
i
put
it
in
my
slipper
because
i
should
feel
it
and
remember
it
then
i
took
off
the
slippers
and
that
was
the
last
i
thought
of
it
it
was
very
careless
said
winnie
with
a
virtuous
air
it
was
noticeable
that
he
took
good
care
to
be
out
of
hearing
of
gypsy
reply
gypsy
returned
to
her
seam
and
the
and
to
her
own
little
meditations
about
the
key
which
being
of
a
private
and
somewhat
humiliating
nature
are
not
given
to
the
public
the
stood
in
one
corner
of
a
very
pleasant
garden
breynton
had
a
great
fancy
for
working
over
his
trees
and
flowers
and
if
he
had
not
been
a
publisher
and
bookseller
might
have
made
a
very
successful
poor
health
had
driven
him
out
of
the
professions
and
the
tastes
of
a
scholar
drove
him
away
from
life
he
had
compromised
the
matter
by
that
down
opposite
the
the
literature
of
a
vermont
town
is
not
of
the
most
nature
and
it
did
occur
to
him
occasionally
that
business
was
rather
dull
but
his
wife
loved
the
old
home
the
children
were
comfortable
and
happy
and
he
himself
he
thought
was
getting
rather
old
to
start
out
on
any
new
venture
elsewhere
so
yorkbury
seemed
likely
to
be
the
family
nest
for
life
it
was
the
same
methodical
that
made
him
at
once
so
thoughtful
and
tender
a
father
and
yet
so
habitually
worried
by
the
children
little
failings
that
gave
him
his
taste
for
beautiful
flowers
and
shrubbery
and
his
skill
in
cultivating
them
this
garden
was
his
pet
enterprise
it
was
gracefully
laid
out
with
winding
walks
evergreens
and
not
in
stiff
patterns
but
with
a
delightful
studied
negligence
such
as
that
with
which
an
artist
would
group
the
figures
on
a
landscape
rocks
and
vines
and
wild
flowers
were
scattered
over
the
garden
very
much
as
they
would
be
found
in
the
fields
stately
roses
and
dahlias
delicate
heliotrope
and
aristocratic
fuchsias
would
grow
side
by
side
with
daisies
and
buttercups
but
best
of
all
gypsy
liked
the
corner
where
the
golden
russet
stood
a
bit
of
a
brook
ran
across
it
which
had
been
caught
in
a
frolic
one
day
as
it
went
singing
away
to
the
meadows
and
dammed
up
and
paved
down
into
a
tiny
pond
the
grass
swept
over
its
edge
like
a
fringe
and
in
their
season
slender
bent
over
casting
little
blue
shadows
into
the
water
the
too
hung
over
it
and
flung
down
their
showers
of
pearls
and
rubies
when
the
wind
was
high
moreover
there
was
a
statue
this
statue
was
gypsy
pride
and
delight
it
was
palace
the
tuilleries
versailles
and
the
alhambra
all
in
one
the
only
fault
to
be
found
with
it
was
that
it
was
not
marble
it
was
a
species
of
composition
but
very
finely
carved
and
much
valued
by
breynton
it
was
a
pretty
thing
a
rising
from
an
unfolded
lily
with
both
hands
parting
her
long
hair
from
a
wondering
face
that
pleased
with
its
own
beauty
was
bent
to
watch
its
reflection
in
the
water
altogether
the
spot
was
so
bewitching
that
it
is
little
wonder
work
kept
dropping
into
her
lap
and
her
eyes
wandering
away
somewhere
into
dreamland
one
of
those
endless
seams
on
a
white
skirt
that
you
have
torn
from
the
placket
to
the
hem
is
not
a
very
attractive
sight
if
you
have
it
to
mend
and
do
happen
to
like
to
sew
any
better
than
gypsy
did
she
seemed
fated
to
be
interrupted
in
her
convulsive
attempts
at
stitching
winnie
was
hardly
in
the
house
before
sarah
rowe
came
out
in
the
garden
to
hunt
her
up
oh
dear
said
gypsy
as
sarah
face
appeared
under
the
i
not
a
bit
glad
to
see
you
that
polite
said
sarah
reddening
i
go
home
again
look
said
gypsy
laughing
just
what
i
got
to
mend
and
i
came
out
here
on
purpose
to
get
it
done
so
i
could
come
over
to
your
house
you
see
i
ought
to
be
glad
to
see
you
at
all
but
i
am
exceedingly
sarah
climbed
up
and
sat
down
beside
her
upon
a
long
swaying
bough
now
do
you
speak
a
single
word
said
gypsy
with
an
industrious
air
till
i
get
this
done
no
i
wo
said
sarah
what
do
you
have
to
sew
for
saturday
afternoons
why
it
my
mending
mother
wants
me
to
do
it
saturday
morning
and
of
course
it
a
great
deal
easier
because
then
you
have
all
the
afternoon
to
yourself
only
i
never
seem
to
get
time
i
sure
i
do
know
why
this
morning
i
had
my
history
topics
to
write
why
i
wrote
mine
yesterday
i
meant
to
but
i
forgot
miss
melville
said
i
mus
put
it
off
another
day
there
i
was
going
to
talk
mother
does
my
mending
for
me
said
sarah
she
does
well
i
just
wish
my
mother
would
she
says
it
would
be
good
for
me
how
did
you
tear
such
a
great
place
i
like
to
know
put
my
foot
right
through
it
said
gypsy
disconsolately
it
was
hanging
on
a
chair
and
i
just
stepped
in
it
and
started
to
run
and
down
i
went
and
here
the
skirt
i
was
running
after
the
cat
i
put
her
under
my
best
hat
and
she
was
spinning
down
stairs
you
never
saw
anything
so
funny
i
always
doing
such
things
i
mean
like
the
skirt
i
do
declare
you
must
talk
i
not
said
sarah
laughing
it
you
that
are
talking
you
sewed
a
stitch
for
five
minutes
either
gypsy
sighed
and
her
needle
began
to
fly
savagely
there
was
a
little
silence
you
see
said
gypsy
breaking
it
i
trying
to
reform
reform
said
sarah
with
some
vague
ideas
of
luther
and
melancthon
and
gypsy
wearing
a
wig
and
spectacles
and
reading
cruden
concordance
yes
nodded
gypsy
reform
i
never
knew
anybody
need
it
as
much
as
i
never
do
things
anyway
and
then
i
do
them
wrong
and
then
i
forget
all
about
them
mother
says
i
improving
she
says
my
room
used
to
look
like
a
perfect
babel
and
now
i
keep
the
wardrobe
door
shut
and
dust
it
out
sometimes
then
there
my
mending
i
came
out
here
so
to
be
quiet
and
at
the
poor
dear
woman
is
so
afraid
i
wo
learn
to
do
things
in
a
way
it
would
be
dreadful
not
to
grow
up
a
lady
would
it
dreadful
said
sarah
only
i
wish
you
hurry
and
get
through
so
we
can
go
down
to
the
swamp
and
sail
could
you
take
a
little
bigger
stitches
no
said
gypsy
resolutely
i
should
have
to
rip
it
all
out
i
going
to
do
it
right
if
it
takes
me
all
day
gypsy
began
to
sew
with
a
will
and
sarah
finding
it
was
for
her
own
interest
in
the
end
stopped
talking
so
the
fearful
seam
was
soon
neatly
finished
the
work
folded
up
and
the
thimble
and
scissors
put
away
carefully
in
the
little
green
reticule
i
lose
so
many
thimbles
you
do
know
observed
gypsy
by
way
of
comment
i
going
to
see
if
i
ca
keep
this
one
three
months
now
let
go
said
sarah
in
a
minute
i
must
carry
my
work
up
first
i
going
to
jump
off
real
fun
you
see
if
i
do
go
as
far
as
that
dandelion
so
gypsy
sprang
from
the
tree
carrying
a
shower
of
blossoms
with
her
oh
look
out
for
the
statue
cried
sarah
the
warning
came
too
late
gypsy
fell
short
of
her
mark
hit
the
heavily
and
it
fell
with
a
crash
into
the
water
where
the
paved
bottom
was
hard
as
rock
just
see
what
you
done
said
sarah
who
had
not
a
capacity
for
making
comforting
remarks
what
do
you
suppose
your
father
will
say
gypsy
stood
aghast
the
water
gurgled
over
the
fallen
statue
whose
pretty
upraised
hands
were
snapped
at
the
wrist
and
the
wondering
face
crushed
in
there
was
a
moment
silence
do
you
tell
said
sarah
at
length
nobody
saw
it
fall
and
never
think
you
did
it
you
just
seem
surprised
and
keep
still
about
it
gypsy
flushed
to
her
forehead
why
sarah
rowe
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
i
would
tell
a
lie
for
anything
in
this
world
it
would
be
a
lie
said
sarah
looking
ashamed
and
provoked
you
need
say
you
did
do
it
it
would
be
a
lie
said
gypsy
decidedly
he
ask
if
anybody
knew
i
would
be
so
mean
even
if
i
knew
he
could
find
out
i
am
going
to
tell
him
this
minute
gypsy
started
off
with
her
cheeks
still
very
red
up
the
garden
paths
and
down
the
road
and
sarah
followed
slowly
gypsy
sense
of
honor
had
received
too
great
a
shock
for
her
to
take
pleasure
just
then
in
company
and
sarah
had
an
uneasy
sense
of
having
lowered
herself
in
her
friend
eyes
so
the
two
girls
separated
for
the
afternoon
it
was
about
a
mile
to
breynton
store
the
afternoon
was
warm
for
the
season
and
the
road
dusty
but
gypsy
ran
nearly
all
the
way
she
was
too
much
troubled
about
the
accident
to
think
of
anything
else
and
in
as
much
haste
to
tell
her
father
as
some
children
would
have
been
to
conceal
it
from
him
old
simms
the
clerk
looked
up
over
his
spectacles
in
mild
astonishment
as
gypsy
entered
the
store
flushed
and
panting
and
pretty
to
simms
who
had
no
children
of
his
own
and
only
a
deaf
wife
and
a
lame
dog
at
home
for
company
gypsy
was
always
pretty
always
such
a
wonderful
development
for
a
young
person
and
always
just
about
right
in
whatever
she
did
why
good
afternoon
miss
gypsy
said
simms
i
surprised
to
see
you
such
a
warm
day
very
much
surprised
but
you
always
were
a
remarkable
young
lady
yes
panted
gypsy
where
father
mr
simms
he
up
in
the
just
now
talking
with
the
foreman
can
i
carry
any
message
for
you
miss
gypsy
oh
simms
said
gypsy
confidentially
i
done
the
most
dreadful
thing
dear
me
i
do
see
how
that
is
possible
said
simms
taking
his
spectacles
off
nervously
and
putting
them
on
again
i
have
said
gypsy
i
broken
the
is
that
all
asked
simms
looking
relieved
why
how
did
it
happen
i
jumped
on
it
jumped
on
it
yes
i
sure
i
do
know
what
father
say
well
i
say
you
are
a
wonderful
young
person
said
simms
proudly
i
sure
i
glad
that
all
do
you
fret
my
dear
your
father
wo
care
much
about
when
he
has
such
a
daughter
but
he
will
said
gypsy
who
regarded
simm
compliments
only
as
a
tiresome
interruption
to
conversation
and
by
no
means
as
entitled
to
any
attention
he
will
be
very
sorry
and
i
am
going
to
tell
him
right
off
please
simms
will
you
speak
to
him
remarkable
development
of
veracity
said
simms
as
he
bowed
himself
away
in
his
polite
way
and
disappeared
up
the
stairway
that
led
to
the
it
seemed
to
gypsy
waiting
there
so
impatiently
as
if
her
father
would
never
come
down
but
come
he
did
at
last
looking
very
much
surprised
to
see
her
and
anxious
to
know
if
the
house
were
on
fire
or
if
winnie
were
drowned
no
said
gypsy
nothing
has
happened
i
mean
nothing
of
that
sort
it
only
about
me
i
have
something
to
tell
you
i
think
i
will
walk
home
with
you
said
her
father
there
is
much
going
on
saturday
afternoons
simms
you
can
lock
up
when
you
go
home
to
supper
i
hope
you
have
been
giving
your
mother
any
trouble
or
thrown
your
ball
into
surly
windows
again
he
added
nervously
as
they
passed
out
of
the
door
and
up
the
street
together
no
sir
said
gypsy
faintly
it
worse
than
that
breynton
heaved
a
sigh
but
said
nothing
i
know
you
think
i
always
up
to
mischief
and
i
do
suppose
i
ever
learn
to
be
a
lady
and
know
how
not
to
break
things
and
i
so
sorry
but
i
did
suppose
there
was
any
harm
in
jumping
off
an
and
the
went
over
and
perhaps
if
you
sent
me
to
school
or
something
i
learn
better
where
they
tie
you
down
to
a
great
board
said
gypsy
talking
very
fast
and
quite
forgetting
her
punctuation
the
echoed
breynton
yes
said
gypsy
dolefully
right
over
into
the
pond
broken
to
smash
oh
gypsy
that
is
too
bad
i
know
it
interrupted
gypsy
i
know
it
was
terribly
careless
terribly
did
you
ever
know
anything
so
exactly
like
me
the
worst
of
it
is
being
sorry
does
help
the
matter
i
wish
i
could
buy
you
another
wo
you
please
to
take
my
five
dollars
and
i
earn
some
more
picking
berries
i
do
want
your
money
my
child
said
breynton
looking
troubled
and
puzzled
i
sorry
the
nymph
is
gone
but
somehow
you
do
seem
to
be
different
from
other
girls
i
did
know
young
ladies
ever
jumped
gypsy
was
silent
her
father
and
mother
seemed
to
think
differently
about
these
things
to
her
view
and
she
felt
sure
to
her
mother
the
fault
lay
in
the
carelessness
of
not
finding
out
whether
the
image
was
in
her
way
she
could
not
see
that
she
was
doing
anything
wrong
in
going
out
alone
into
an
and
springing
from
a
low
bough
upon
the
soft
grass
very
likely
when
she
was
a
young
lady
with
long
dresses
and
hair
done
up
behind
she
should
care
anything
about
climbing
trees
but
that
was
another
question
however
she
had
too
much
respect
for
her
father
to
say
this
so
she
hung
her
head
feeling
very
humble
and
sorry
and
wondering
if
simms
could
plaster
the
nymph
together
somehow
he
was
always
so
ready
to
do
things
for
her
well
said
her
father
after
a
moment
thought
in
which
he
had
been
struggling
with
a
sense
of
disappointment
at
the
destruction
of
his
statue
that
would
have
made
a
less
man
scold
well
it
ca
be
helped
and
as
to
the
climbing
trees
i
suppose
your
mother
knows
best
i
am
glad
you
came
and
told
me
anyway
very
glad
you
are
a
truthful
child
gypsy
in
spite
of
your
faults
i
could
bear
to
tell
lies
said
gypsy
brightening
a
little
it
is
possible
this
was
another
one
of
the
reasons
why
people
had
such
a
habit
of
loving
gypsy
what
do
you
think
chapter
vii
just
like
gypsy
one
afternoon
gypsy
was
coming
home
from
the
it
was
a
rare
june
day
the
great
soft
shadows
fell
and
faded
on
the
mountains
and
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
breath
of
a
hundred
fields
where
crimson
clovers
nodded
in
the
sleepy
wind
it
seemed
to
gypsy
that
she
had
never
seen
such
mellow
sunlight
or
skies
so
pure
and
blue
that
no
birds
ever
sung
such
songs
in
the
and
never
were
butterflies
so
golden
and
brown
and
beautiful
as
those
which
fluttered
drowsily
over
the
tiny
roadside
clovers
the
thought
came
to
her
like
a
little
sudden
that
thrilled
her
through
and
through
that
this
world
was
a
very
great
world
and
very
beautiful
it
seemed
so
alive
and
happy
from
the
arch
of
the
blazing
sky
down
to
the
blossoms
of
the
purple
weeds
that
hid
in
the
grass
she
wondered
that
she
had
never
thought
of
it
before
how
many
millions
of
people
were
enjoying
this
wonderful
day
what
a
great
thing
it
was
to
live
in
such
a
world
where
everything
was
so
beautiful
and
useful
and
happy
the
very
fact
that
she
was
alive
in
it
made
her
so
glad
she
felt
as
if
she
would
like
to
go
off
on
the
rocks
somewhere
and
shout
and
jump
and
sing
as
she
walked
slowly
along
past
the
stores
and
the
crowded
swinging
her
little
on
her
arm
and
dreaming
away
with
her
great
brown
eyes
as
such
young
eyes
will
always
dream
upon
a
day
there
suddenly
struck
upon
that
happy
thought
of
hers
a
mournful
sound
it
was
a
human
groan
it
grated
on
gypsy
musing
as
a
file
grates
upon
smooth
marble
she
started
and
looked
up
the
sound
came
from
an
open
window
directly
over
her
head
what
could
anybody
be
groaning
about
such
a
day
as
this
gypsy
felt
a
momentary
impatience
with
the
mournful
sound
then
a
sudden
curiosity
to
know
what
it
meant
a
door
happened
to
be
open
near
her
and
she
walked
right
in
without
a
second
thought
as
was
the
fashion
in
which
gypsy
usually
did
things
a
pair
of
steep
stairs
led
up
from
the
bit
of
an
entry
and
a
quantity
of
children
whose
faces
and
hands
were
decidedly
the
worse
for
wear
were
playing
on
them
how
do
you
do
said
gypsy
the
children
stared
who
lives
here
asked
gypsy
again
the
children
put
their
fingers
in
their
mouths
who
is
that
groaning
so
persisted
gypsy
repressing
a
strong
desire
to
box
their
ears
the
children
crawled
a
little
further
and
peered
at
her
from
between
their
locks
of
shaggy
hair
as
if
they
considered
her
a
species
of
burglar
at
this
moment
a
side
door
opened
and
a
woman
who
was
wiping
her
hands
on
her
apron
put
her
head
out
into
the
entry
and
asked
in
rather
a
surly
tone
what
was
wanted
who
is
that
groaning
repeated
gypsy
oh
that
nobody
but
grandmother
littlejohn
said
the
woman
with
a
laugh
she
always
but
what
does
she
groan
for
insisted
gypsy
her
curiosity
nowise
diminished
to
see
a
person
who
could
be
always
through
not
only
one
but
many
of
such
golden
summer
days
oh
i
she
got
reason
enough
for
the
matter
of
that
said
the
woman
carelessly
she
broke
a
bone
though
she
do
make
a
terrible
fuss
over
it
and
very
it
is
to
the
neighbors
as
has
the
after
of
her
broken
a
bone
poor
thing
i
going
right
up
to
see
her
said
gypsy
whose
compassion
was
rising
fast
good
luck
to
you
said
the
woman
with
a
laugh
gypsy
did
not
like
very
much
it
only
strengthened
her
resolution
however
and
she
ran
up
the
narrow
stairs
scattering
the
children
right
and
left
several
other
women
opened
doors
and
peered
out
at
her
as
she
went
by
but
no
one
else
spoke
to
her
guided
by
the
sound
of
the
groans
which
came
at
regular
intervals
like
long
breaths
she
went
up
a
second
flight
of
stairs
more
narrow
and
more
dark
than
the
first
and
turned
into
a
little
low
room
the
door
of
which
stood
open
who
there
called
a
fretful
voice
from
inside
i
said
gypsy
may
i
come
in
i
do
know
who
you
be
said
the
voice
but
you
may
come
ef
you
want
to
gypsy
accepted
the
somewhat
dubious
invitation
the
room
was
in
sad
disorder
and
very
dusty
an
old
yellow
cat
sat
blinking
at
a
sunbeam
and
an
old
yellow
wizened
woman
lay
upon
the
bed
her
forehead
was
all
drawn
and
knotted
with
pain
and
her
mouth
looked
just
like
her
voice
fretful
and
sharp
she
turned
her
head
slowly
as
gypsy
entered
but
otherwise
she
did
not
alter
her
position
as
if
it
were
one
which
she
could
not
change
without
pain
good
afternoon
said
gypsy
feeling
a
little
embarrassed
and
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
say
now
she
was
up
there
good
arternoon
said
grandmother
littlejohn
with
a
groan
i
heard
you
groan
out
in
the
street
said
gypsy
rushing
to
the
point
at
once
i
came
up
to
see
what
was
the
matter
matter
said
the
old
woman
sharply
i
fell
down
stairs
and
broke
my
ankle
that
the
matter
i
wonder
the
whole
town
hai
heerd
me
holler
i
ca
sleep
day
nor
night
with
the
pain
it
matter
enough
i
think
i
real
sorry
said
gypsy
littlejohn
broke
into
a
fresh
spasm
of
groaning
at
this
and
seemed
to
be
in
such
suffering
that
it
made
gypsy
turn
pale
to
hear
her
have
you
had
a
doctor
she
asked
compassionately
laws
yes
said
the
old
woman
had
a
doctor
i
guess
i
have
a
young
fellar
who
said
he
was
representative
from
somewhere
from
medical
profession
seems
to
me
it
war
but
i
never
heerd
o
wharever
it
is
he
with
his
whiskers
only
half
growed
of
my
foot
into
a
wooden
box
of
me

gave
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
and
he
hai

nigh
me
since
and
i

the
old
woman
i

down
stairs

gypsy
concluded
to
suppress
her
surgical
information
who
takes
care
of
you
she
asked
suddenly
nobody
do
want
nobody

of
me
when
i
ai
shut
up
in
a
box
on
the
bed

enough
of
themselves
about
me
talks
of
the
starve
fust
who

asked
gypsy
beginning
to
think
grandmother
littlejohn
was
a
very
woman
it
little
enough
i
gets
said
the
old
woman
groaning
afresh
they
brings
me
up
a
cup
of
cold
tea
when
they
feels
like
it
and
crusts
of
bread
and
i
with
no
teeth
to
eat
i
hai
had
a
mouthful
of

this
day
and
that

gypsy

and

mother

of

care
of
everybody

a
pretty
little
gal
said
littlejohn
with
a
sigh
i
hope
you
be
rewarded
for
yourself
about
a
poor
old
woman
like
me
does
your
ma
use
white
sugar
i
like
white
sugar
in
my
tea

said
gypsy
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
to
be
called
a
pretty
little
gal
oh
yes

have
a
whole
barrel
full
you
can
have
some
just
as
well
as

pound
or
so
and
i
have
five
dollars
at
home
that
you

have
what
would

like
to
have
me

for
you
dear
me
said
littlejohn
what
a
angel
of
mercy
to
the
poor
and
afflicted
you
be
i
should
like
some
fresh
salmon
and
green
peas
now
if
i
could
get
very
well
said
gypsy
i
hurry
home
and
see
about
it
accordingly
she
left
the
old
woman
groaning
out
her
thanks
and
went
down
the
narrow
stairs
and
into
the
street
she
ran
all
the
way
home
and
rushed
into
the
parlor
where
her
mother
was
sitting
quietly
sewing
she
looked
up
as
the
door
burst
open
and
gypsy
swept
in
like
a
little
hurricane
her
turban
hanging
down
her
neck
her
hair
loose
and
flying
about
an
eager
face
that
was
all
on
fire
with
its
warm
crimson
color
and
twinkling
eyes
why
gypsy
oh
mother
such
an
old
woman
such
a
poor
old
woman
groaning
right
out
in
the
street
i
mean
i
was
out
in
the
street
and
heard
her
groan
up
two
flights
of
the
stairs
and
she
broke
her
ankle
and
the
neighbors
wo
give
her
anything
to
eat
unless
she
goes
to
the
and
starves
and
she
has
had
any
dinner
and
wait
a
minute
gypsy
what
does
all
this
mean
why
she
fell
down
those
horrid
stairs
and
broke
her
ankle
and
wants
some
salmon
and
green
peas
and
i
going
to
give
her
my
five
dollars
and
oh
white
sugar
some
white
sugar
for
her
tea
i
never
heard
anybody
groan
so
in
all
my
life
breynton
laid
down
her
work
and
laughed
why
mother
said
gypsy
reddening
i
do
see
what
there
is
to
laugh
at
my
dear
gypsy
you
would
laugh
if
you
had
heard
your
own
story
the
most
i
can
make
out
of
it
is
that
a
little
girl
who
is
so
excited
she
hardly
knows
what
she
is
talking
about
has
seen
an
old
woman
who
has
been
begging
for
fresh
salmon
and
broken
her
ankle
and
is
starving
began
gypsy
stop
a
minute
interrupted
breynton
gently
sit
down
and
take
off
your
things
and
when
you
get
rested
tell
me
the
story
quietly
and
slowly
and
then
we
will
see
what
is
to
be
done
for
your
old
woman
gypsy
very
reluctantly
obeyed
it
seemed
to
her
incredible
that
any
one
could
be
so
quiet
and
composed
as
her
mother
was
when
there
was
an
old
woman
in
town
who
had
had
no
dinner
however
she
sat
still
and
fanned
herself
and
when
she
was
rested
she
managed
to
tell
her
story
in
as
connected
and
rational
manner
and
with
as
few
comments
and
exclamations
of
her
own
as
gypsy
was
capable
of
getting
along
with
in
any
narration
very
well
said
her
mother
when
it
was
finished
i
begin
to
understand
things
better
let
me
see
in
the
first
place
you
felt
so
sorry
for
the
old
woman
that
you
went
alone
into
a
strange
house
among
a
sort
of
people
you
knew
nothing
about
and
without
stopping
to
think
whether
i
should
be
willing
to
have
you
was
that
so
yes
said
gypsy
hanging
her
head
a
little
i
did
think
she
did
groan
so
then
littlejohn
seems
to
like
to
complain
it
strikes
me
complain
said
gypsy
indignantly
yes
a
little
however
she
might
have
worse
faults
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
her
seems
to
be
her
modest
request
for
salmon
and
white
sugar
you
propose
giving
them
to
her
why
yes
said
gypsy
promptly
she
in
such
dreadful
pain
when
i
sprained
my
wrist
you
gave
me
nice
things
to
eat
but
it
would
follow
that
i
should
give
littlejohn
the
same
said
breynton
gently
salmon
and
white
sugar
are
expensive
luxuries
i
might
be
able
to
do
something
to
help
littlejohn
but
i
might
not
be
able
to
afford
to
take
her
down
the
two
or
three
pounds
of
sugar
you
promised
her
nor
to
spend
several
dollars
on
fresh
salmon
a
delicacy
which
we
have
had
on
our
own
table
but
once
this
season
besides
there
are
thirty
or
forty
sick
people
in
town
probably
who
are
as
poor
and
as
much
in
need
of
assistance
as
this
one
old
woman
you
see
do
you
that
i
could
not
give
salmon
and
peas
and
white
sugar
to
them
all
and
it
would
be
unwise
in
me
to
spend
all
my
money
on
one
when
i
might
divide
it
and
help
several
people
but
there
my
five
dollars
said
gypsy
only
half
convinced
very
well
supposing
i
were
to
let
you
give
it
all
away
to
littlejohn
even
if
she
were
the
most
worthy
and
needy
person
that
could
be
found
in
town
what
then
it
is
all
gone
you
have
nothing
more
to
give
the
next
week
a
poor
little
girl
who
has
no
hat
and
ca
go
to
excites
your
sympathy
and
you
would
be
glad
to
give
something
toward
buying
her
a
hat
you
have
not
a
copper
you
go
to
monthly
concert
and
want
to
drop
something
into
the
contribution
box
but
littlejohn
has
eaten
up
what
you
might
have
given
you
want
to
do
something
for
the
poor
freedmen
who
are
coming
into
our
armies
you
can
not
do
it
for
you
have
nothing
to
give
well
said
gypsy
with
a
ludicrous
expression
of
conviction
and
discomfiture
i
suppose
so
i
did
think
think
the
old
enemy
gypsy
and
now
that
i
have
pointed
out
the
little
mistakes
you
made
this
afternoon
i
want
to
tell
you
gypsy
how
pleased
i
am
that
you
were
so
quick
to
feel
sorry
for
the
old
woman
and
so
ready
to
be
generous
with
your
own
money
and
help
i
would
rather
have
you
fail
a
dozen
times
on
the
unselfish
side
than
to
have
you
careless
and
heartless
towards
the
people
god
has
made
poor
and
in
suffering
there
i
have
given
you
a
long
sermon
do
you
think
mother
is
always
scolding
breynton
drew
her
into
her
arms
and
gave
her
one
of
those
little
soft
kisses
on
the
forehead
that
gypsy
liked
so
much
i
will
go
down
and
see
the
old
woman
after
supper
she
said
then
could
you
go
before
suggested
gypsy
she
said
she
had
had
any
dinner
we
ca
do
things
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
not
even
our
charities
said
breynton
smiling
i
have
some
work
which
i
can
not
leave
now
and
i
have
little
doubt
the
woman
had
some
dinner
the
poor
are
almost
always
very
kind
neighbors
to
each
other
i
will
be
there
early
enough
to
take
her
some
supper
so
gypsy
was
comforted
for
littlejohn
it
was
nearly
dark
when
breynton
came
up
from
the
village
with
her
pleasant
smile
and
her
little
basket
that
half
yorkbury
knew
so
well
by
sight
for
the
biscuit
and
the
jellies
the
and
the
dried
beef
and
the
cookies
that
it
brought
to
so
many
gypsy
had
been
watching
for
her
impatiently
and
ran
down
to
the
gate
to
meet
her
well
did
you
find
her
oh
yes
what
do
you
think
of
her
asked
gypsy
a
little
puzzled
by
her
expression
she
is
a
good
deal
of
a
scold
and
something
of
a
sufferer
said
breynton
gypsy
face
fell
and
they
walked
up
to
the
house
in
silence
then
you
not
going
to
do
anything
for
her
asked
gypsy
at
length
in
a
disappointed
tone
oh
yes
she
needs
help
she
ca
be
moved
to
the
now
and
besides
is
likely
to
get
well
before
long
if
she
is
properly
taken
care
of
i
gave
her
her
supper
and
have
arranged
with
one
or
two
of
the
ladies
to
send
her
meals
for
a
few
days
till
we
see
how
she
is
and
what
had
better
be
done
i
take
care
of
her
and
rowe
takes
her
the
next
day
good
said
gypsy
brightening
and
i
may
take
her
down
the
things
may
i
mother
if
you
want
to
gypsy
went
to
bed
as
happy
as
a
queen
the
next
morning
she
rose
early
to
be
sure
to
be
in
time
to
take
littlejohn
breakfast
and
was
disappointed
enough
when
her
mother
thought
it
best
she
should
wait
till
she
had
eaten
her
own
however
on
the
strength
of
the
remembrance
of
her
mother
tried
and
proved
wisdom
on
certain
other
little
occasions
she
submitted
with
a
good
grace
she
carried
littlejohn
a
very
good
breakfast
of
and
and
sweet
white
bread
and
was
somewhat
taken
aback
to
find
that
the
old
woman
received
it
rather
curtly
and
asked
after
the
salmon
it
was
very
warm
at
noon
when
she
carried
the
dinner
the
walk
was
long
and
wearisome
and
littlejohn
neglected
to
call
her
an
angel
of
mercy
and
it
must
be
confessed
gypsy
enthusiasm
diminished
perceptibly
that
evening
and
breynton
were
out
to
tea
and
tom
was
off
fishing
breynton
left
littlejohn
supper
in
a
basket
on
the
shelf
and
told
gypsy
where
it
was
gypsy
had
been
having
a
great
frolic
in
the
fresh
hay
with
sarah
rowe
and
came
in
late
no
one
but
winnie
was
there
she
ate
her
supper
in
a
great
hurry
and
went
out
again
patty
saw
her
from
the
window
and
concluded
she
had
gone
to
littlejohn
that
night
about
eleven
some
one
knocked
at
door
and
woke
her
up
who
is
it
she
called
oh
mother
breynton
said
a
doleful
voice
what
you
suppose
done
now
i
sure
i
do
know
said
breynton
with
a
resigned
sigh
i
hope
she
has
been
walking
in
her
sleep
again
said
breynton
nervously
forgotten
littlejohn
supper
said
the
doleful
voice
through
the
why
gypsy
i
know
it
said
gypsy
humbly
could
i
dress
and
run
down
why
no
indeed
it
ca
be
helped
now
run
back
to
bed
just
like
gypsy
for
all
the
world
said
tom
the
next
morning
always
so
quick
and
generous
and
sorry
for
people
and
ready
to
do
and
you
can
depend
on
her
just
about
as
much
as
you
could
on
a
brisk
west
wind
chapter
viii
peace
maythorne
after
you
have
seen
littlejohn
and
explained
why
she
went
supperless
last
night
said
breynton
i
want
you
to
do
an
errand
for
me
what
is
it
asked
gypsy
pleasantly
she
felt
very
humble
and
much
ashamed
this
morning
and
anxious
to
make
herself
useful
i
want
you
to
find
out
where
peace
maythorne
room
is
it
is
in
the
same
house
and
carry
her
this
with
my
love
breynton
took
up
a
copy
of
harper
magazine
and
handed
it
to
gypsy
tell
her
i
have
turned
the
leaf
down
at
some
articles
i
think
will
interest
her
and
ask
her
if
the
powder
i
left
her
put
her
to
sleep
who
is
peace
maythorne
asked
gypsy
wondering
is
she
poor
yes
how
funny
to
send
her
a
said
gypsy
why
do
you
give
her
some
money
or
something
some
things
are
worth
more
than
money
to
some
people
said
breynton
smiling
why
then
you
had
been
into
that
house
before
i
found
mrs
littlejohn
said
gypsy
as
the
thought
first
struck
her
oh
yes
many
times
gypsy
started
off
with
the
magazine
under
her
arm
wondering
if
there
were
a
house
in
town
filled
with
these
wretched
poor
in
which
her
mother
was
not
known
as
a
friend
her
heart
sank
a
little
as
she
climbed
the
dark
stairs
to
littlejohn
room
she
had
begged
of
her
mother
a
tiny
pailful
of
green
peas
with
which
she
hoped
to
pacify
the
old
woman
but
she
was
somewhat
in
dread
of
hearing
her
talk
and
ashamed
to
confess
her
own
neglect
littlejohn
was
eating
the
very
nice
breakfast
which
rowe
had
sent
over
and
groaning
dolefully
over
it
as
gypsy
entered
good
morning
said
gypsy
good
morning
said
littlejohn
severely
i
went
out
to
play
in
the
hay
with
sarah
rowe
and
forgot
all
about
your
supper
last
night
and
i
just
as
sorry
as
i
can
be
said
gypsy
coming
to
the
point
frankly
and
without
any
attempt
to
excuse
herself
oh
of
course
said
littlejohn
in
the
tone
of
a
martyr
it
all
i
expect
i
a
poor
lone
widdy
with
a
bone
broke
and
i
used
to
forgot
little
gals
that
has
everything
they
want
and
five
dollars
besides
and
promises
me
salmon
and
such
could
be
expected
to
remember
the
and
afflicted
of
course
not
it
was
not
an
easy
nor
a
pleasant
thing
to
apologize
to
a
person
to
whom
she
had
played
the
charitable
lady
the
day
before
and
manner
of
receiving
the
explanation
certainly
made
it
no
easier
but
gypsy
as
the
saying
goes
swallowed
her
pride
and
felt
that
she
deserved
it
i
brought
you
some
peas
she
said
meekly
oh
said
the
old
woman
relenting
a
little
you
have
have
you
well
i
obleeged
to
you
and
you
can
set
in
the
cupboard
gypsy
emptied
her
peas
into
a
yellow
bowl
which
she
found
in
the
cupboard
and
then
asked
can
i
do
anything
for
you
i
terrible
thirsty
said
littlejohn
with
a
long
groan
some
water
in
that
air
pail
gypsy
went
into
the
corner
where
the
pail
stood
and
filled
the
mug
with
water
then
not
being
able
to
think
of
anything
more
to
say
she
concluded
to
go
good
said
littlejohn
in
a
forgiving
tone
i
hope
you
come
agin
gypsy
secretly
thought
it
was
doubtful
if
she
ever
did
her
charity
like
that
of
most
young
people
of
her
age
and
experience
was
not
of
the
sort
calculated
to
survive
under
difficulties
or
to
deal
successfully
with
shrewish
old
women
after
inquiring
in
vain
of
the
group
of
staring
children
where
peace
maythorne
room
was
gypsy
resorted
to
her
friend
the
woman
who
directed
her
to
a
door
upon
the
second
story
it
was
closed
and
gypsy
knocked
come
in
said
a
quiet
voice
gypsy
went
in
wondering
why
peace
maythorne
did
not
get
up
and
open
the
door
and
if
she
did
not
know
it
was
more
polite
she
stopped
short
as
she
entered
the
room
and
wondered
no
longer
it
was
a
plain
bare
room
but
neat
enough
and
not
unpleasant
nor
unhomelike
because
of
the
great
flood
of
morning
sunlight
that
fell
in
and
touched
everything
to
golden
warmth
it
touched
most
brightly
and
lingered
longest
on
a
low
bed
drawn
up
between
the
windows
a
girl
lay
there
with
a
pale
face
turned
over
on
the
pillows
and
weak
thin
hands
folded
on
the
counterpane
she
might
from
her
size
have
been
about
sixteen
years
of
age
but
her
face
was
like
the
face
of
a
woman
long
grown
old
the
clothing
of
the
bed
partially
concealed
her
shoulders
which
were
cruelly
rounded
and
bent
so
peace
maythorne
was
a
cripple
gypsy
recovered
from
her
astonishment
with
a
little
start
and
said
blushing
for
fear
she
had
been
rude
good
morning
i
gypsy
breynton
mother
sent
me
down
with
a
magazine
i
am
glad
to
see
you
said
peace
maythorne
smiling
wo
you
sit
down
gypsy
took
a
chair
by
the
bed
thinking
how
pleasant
the
old
pale
face
was
after
all
and
how
kindly
and
happy
the
smile
your
mother
is
very
kind
said
peace
she
is
always
doing
something
for
me
she
has
given
me
a
great
deal
to
read
do
you
like
to
read
i
do
said
gypsy
why
yes
said
peace
opening
her
eyes
wide
i
thought
everybody
liked
to
read
besides
i
ca
do
anything
else
you
know
nothing
at
all
asked
gypsy
only
sometimes
when
the
pain
is
very
bad
i
try
to
help
aunt
about
her
sewing
i
ca
do
much
oh
you
live
with
your
aunt
said
gypsy
yes
she
takes
in
sewing
she
out
just
now
does
your
back
pain
you
a
great
deal
asked
gypsy
oh
yes
all
the
time
but
then
i
get
used
to
it
you
know
said
peace
the
time
oh
i
am
so
sorry
said
gypsy
drawing
a
long
breath
oh
it
might
be
worse
said
peace
smiling
i
only
lain
here
three
years
some
people
ca
move
for
forty
the
doctor
says
i
live
so
long
as
that
gypsy
looked
at
the
low
bed
the
narrow
room
the
pallid
face
and
shrunken
body
cramped
there
moveless
on
the
pillows
three
years
three
years
to
lie
through
summer
suns
and
winter
snows
while
all
the
world
was
out
at
play
and
happy
well
said
gypsy
as
the
most
appropriate
comment
suggesting
itself
you
rather
different
from
mrs
littlejohn
peace
smiled
there
was
something
rare
about
peace
maythorne
smile
poor
littlejohn
you
see
she
is
used
to
being
sick
and
i
am
that
makes
the
difference
oh
i
forgot
said
gypsy
abruptly
mother
said
i
was
to
ask
if
those
powders
she
left
you
put
you
to
sleep
nicely
they
better
than
anything
the
doctor
gave
me
everything
your
mother
does
seems
to
be
the
best
sort
somehow
she
ca
touch
your
hand
or
smooth
your
pillow
without
doing
it
differently
from
other
people
that
so
said
gypsy
emphatically
there
is
anybody
else
like
her
do
you
lie
awake
very
often
peace
answered
in
the
two
quiet
words
that
were
on
her
lips
so
often
in
the
quiet
voice
that
never
complained
oh
yes
there
was
a
little
silence
gypsy
was
watching
peace
peace
had
her
eyes
turned
away
from
her
visitor
but
she
was
conscious
of
every
quick
nervous
breath
gypsy
drew
and
every
impatient
little
flutter
of
her
hands
the
two
girls
were
studying
each
other
gypsy
investigations
whatever
they
were
seemed
to
be
very
pleasant
for
she
started
at
last
with
a
bit
of
a
sigh
and
announced
the
result
of
them
in
the
characteristic
words
i
like
you
to
her
surprise
peace
just
turned
up
her
eyes
and
turned
them
away
and
the
eyes
were
full
of
tears
after
a
moment
thank
you
i
do
see
many
people
so
young
except
the
children
i
tell
them
stories
sometimes
but
you
wo
like
me
said
gypsy
i
rather
think
i
shall
no
you
wo
said
gypsy
shaking
her
head
decidedly
not
a
bit
i
know
you
wo
i
silly
well
i
tell
you
what
i
am
first
i
want
to
hear
all
about
you
everything
i
mean
she
added
with
a
quick
delicacy
of
which
for
blundering
gypsy
she
had
a
great
deal
everything
that
you
care
to
tell
me
why
i
nothing
to
tell
said
peace
smiling
cooped
up
here
all
the
time
it
all
the
same
that
just
what
i
want
to
hear
about
about
the
being
cooped
up
i
see
you
bear
said
gypsy
impetuously
peace
smiled
again
gypsy
had
a
fancy
that
the
smile
had
stolen
one
of
the
sunbeams
that
lay
in
such
golden
flickering
waves
upon
the
bed
too
much
is
often
a
sign
of
the
extremest
vanity
peace
had
nothing
of
this
seeing
that
gypsy
was
in
earnest
in
her
wish
to
hear
her
story
she
quietly
began
it
without
further
parley
it
was
very
simple
and
quickly
told
we
used
to
live
on
a
farm
on
the
mountains
father
and
mother
and
i
there
were
a
great
many
cattle
and
so
much
ground
it
tired
me
to
walk
across
it
i
always
went
to
school
and
father
read
to
us
in
the
evenings
i
suppose
that
the
way
i
learned
to
love
to
read
and
i
been
so
glad
since
i
was
pretty
small
when
they
died
first
father
then
mother
i
remember
it
a
little
at
least
i
remember
about
mother
she
kissed
me
so
and
cried
then
aunt
jane
came
for
me
and
brought
me
here
we
lived
in
a
pleasant
house
up
the
street
at
first
i
used
to
work
in
the
mill
and
earned
enough
to
pay
aunt
what
i
cost
her
then
one
day
when
i
was
thirteen
years
old
we
were
coming
out
at
noon
all
of
us
girls
in
a
great
hurry
and
frolic
and
i
felt
sick
and
dizzy
watching
the
wheels
go
round
and
well
they
did
mean
to
but
they
pushed
me
and
i
fell
down
stairs
all
the
way
it
was
a
long
crooked
flight
i
struck
my
spine
on
every
step
oh
peace
said
gypsy
half
under
her
breath
i
was
sick
for
a
little
while
then
i
got
better
i
thought
it
was
all
over
then
one
day
i
found
a
little
curve
between
my
shoulders
and
so
well
it
came
so
slowly
i
hardly
knew
it
till
at
last
i
was
in
bed
with
the
pain
we
had
come
here
because
it
was
hard
times
and
aunt
had
to
support
me
and
then
there
were
the
doctor
bills
does
he
say
you
can
get
well
never
sit
up
a
little
while
oh
no
gypsy
gasped
a
little
as
if
she
were
suffocating
and
your
aunt
is
she
kind
to
you
oh
yes
a
certain
flitting
expression
that
the
face
of
peace
caught
with
the
words
gypsy
could
not
help
seeing
but
i
mean
real
kind
does
she
love
you
the
girl
cheek
flushed
to
a
pale
quick
crimson
then
faded
slowly
she
is
very
good
to
me
i
am
a
great
trouble
you
know
i
am
not
her
own
it
is
very
hard
for
her
that
i
ca
support
myself
gypsy
said
something
just
then
in
her
innermost
thought
of
thoughts
about
aunt
jane
that
aunt
jane
would
not
have
cared
to
hear
if
i
could
only
earn
something
said
peace
with
a
quick
breath
that
sounded
like
a
sigh
that
is
hardest
of
all
but
it
all
right
somehow
peace
maythorne
said
gypsy
in
a
little
flash
i
do
see
never
to
go
out
in
the
wind
and
jump
on
the
hay
and
climb
the
mountains
and
run
and
row
and
snowball
why
it
would
me
and
you
lie
here
so
sweet
and
patient
and
you
have
said
a
cross
word
all
the
while
you
been
telling
me
about
it
i
do
understand
how
can
you
you
bear
it
i
could
if
i
did
tell
him
said
peace
softly
whom
god
there
was
a
long
silence
gypsy
looked
out
of
the
window
winking
very
hard
and
peace
lay
quite
still
upon
the
bed
there
said
gypsy
at
last
with
a
jump
i
shall
be
late
to
school
oh
said
peace
you
have
told
me
anything
about
yourself
you
said
you
would
well
said
gypsy
tying
on
her
hat
that
easy
enough
done
i
silly
and
cross
and
forgetful
and
blundering
i
do
believe
it
said
peace
laughing
i
am
said
gypsy
confidentially
it
all
true
and
i
always
tearing
my
dresses
and
worrying
father
and
getting
mad
at
winnie
and
bothering
miss
melville
and
romping
round
and
breaking
my
neck
and
then
when
things
do
go
right
how
i
scold
peace
smiled
and
looked
incredulous
it
just
so
said
gypsy
giving
a
little
sharp
nod
to
emphasize
her
words
and
here
you
lie
and
never
think
of
being
cross
and
impatient
and
love
everybody
and
everybody
loves
you
and
well
all
i
have
to
say
is
if
i
were
you
i
should
have
scolded
everybody
out
of
the
house
long
before
this
you
must
talk
so
about
me
said
peace
a
faint
shadow
of
pain
crossing
her
face
you
do
know
how
wicked
i
am
nobody
knows
i
am
cross
very
often
sometimes
when
my
back
aches
as
if
i
should
scream
and
aunt
is
talking
i
hide
my
face
under
the
clothes
and
do
say
a
word
to
her
you
call
being
cross
said
gypsy
with
her
eyes
very
wide
open
she
buttoned
on
her
sack
and
started
to
go
but
stopped
a
minute
i
do
suppose
you
want
me
to
come
again
i
so
noisy
and
all
oh
i
should
be
so
glad
said
peace
with
one
of
those
rare
smiles
i
did
dare
to
ask
you
well
i
come
but
i
told
you
you
would
like
me
i
do
said
peace
i
like
you
very
much
how
funny
said
gypsy
then
she
bade
her
and
went
to
school
mother
she
said
at
night
did
you
have
any
particular
reason
in
sending
me
to
peace
maythorne
perhaps
so
said
breynton
smiling
why
nothing
only
i
thought
so
you
were
a
very
wise
woman
a
while
after
she
spoke
up
suddenly
mother
do
the
quakers
say
good
matches
are
made
in
heaven
who
been
putting
sentimental
ideas
into
the
child
head
said
her
father
in
an
undertone
why
gypsy
breynton
said
winnie
looking
very
much
shocked
you
ought
to
say
such
things
of
course
the
brimstone
falls
down
from
hell
and
they
pick
it
up
and
put
it
on
the
matches
what
made
you
ask
the
question
said
breynton
when
the
laugh
had
subsided
oh
i
was
only
thinking
i
guessed
peace
maythorne
name
was
made
in
heaven
it
so
exactly
suits
her
after
that
the
cripple
little
quiet
room
became
one
of
the
places
gypsy
loved
best
in
yorkbury
two
or
three
weeks
after
that
littlejohn
who
had
been
gaining
rapidly
in
strength
and
good
temper
under
breynton
wise
and
kindly
care
took
it
into
her
head
one
morning
when
she
was
alone
to
walk
across
the
room
and
look
out
of
the
window
the
weakened
limb
was
not
in
a
fit
state
to
be
used
at
all
and
the
shock
given
to
it
was
very
great
inflammation
set
in
and
fever
and
the
doctor
shook
his
head
and
asked
if
the
old
woman
had
any
friends
living
anywhere
if
so
they
had
better
be
sent
for
but
the
poor
creature
seemed
to
be
desolate
enough
declared
she
had
no
relatives
and
was
glad
of
it
she
only
wanted
to
be
let
alone
and
she
should
get
well
fast
enough
she
never
said
that
when
breynton
was
in
the
room
gypsy
went
down
one
evening
with
her
mother
to
help
her
carry
a
bundle
of
fresh
and
she
was
astonished
at
the
gentleness
which
had
crept
into
the
old
withered
face
and
peevish
voice
littlejohn
called
her
up
to
the
bed
just
as
she
started
to
go
i
say
little
gal
i
told
ye
a
fib
the
day
ye
fust
come
i
did
have
a
dinner
though
it
war
a
terrible
measly
one
breynton
marm
breynton
stepped
up
to
her
what
was
that
ye
read
day
liars
not
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
i
forgot
gypsy
crept
out
softly
she
was
wondering
how
her
mother
had
managed
her
charity
to
this
fretful
old
woman
so
wisely
that
her
words
unfitly
spoken
were
becoming
a
trouble
to
herself
and
her
hours
of
increasing
pain
turned
into
hours
of
late
faint
repentance
perhaps
the
charm
lay
in
a
certain
old
book
and
worn
and
dusty
from
long
disuse
on
the
cupboard
shelf
this
little
book
breynton
had
found
and
she
had
read
in
it
many
times
until
that
painful
groaning
ceased
and
so
one
night
it
chanced
that
the
old
yellow
cat
sat
blinking
at
the
light
and
the
yellow
furrowed
face
turned
over
on
the
pillow
and
smiled
and
lay
still
the
light
burned
out
and
the
morning
came
the
cat
jumped
purring
upon
the
bed
and
seeing
what
was
there
curled
up
by
it
with
a
mournful
mewing
cry
peace
maythorne
says
said
gypsy
that
if
littlejohn
went
to
heaven
she
will
be
so
happy
find
she
does
is
it
funny
in
peace
to
think
of
such
things
chapter
ix
camping
out
do
you
remember
gough
famous
story
of
the
orator
who
with
a
great
flourish
of
rhetoric
as
prelude
announced
to
his
audience
the
startling
fact
that
there
was
a
gre
at
difference
in
people
on
the
strength
of
this
original
statement
it
has
been
supposed
that
there
were
a
variety
of
tastes
to
be
suited
in
selecting
for
the
readers
of
gypsy
breynton
the
most
entertaining
passages
of
this
one
summer
in
her
life
the
last
two
chapters
were
for
the
quiet
young
people
this
one
is
for
the
lively
young
people
the
people
who
like
to
live
out
of
doors
and
have
adventures
and
get
into
difficulties
and
get
over
them
the
quiet
people
aforesaid
need
not
read
it
if
they
do
want
to
did
you
ever
camp
out
if
you
ever
did
or
ever
very
much
wanted
to
you
will
know
how
gypsy
felt
one
morning
after
her
summer
vacation
had
begun
and
she
was
wondering
what
she
should
do
with
herself
all
day
when
tom
came
into
her
room
and
said
gypsy
do
you
wish
you
were
a
boy
i
going
to
spend
a
week
at
ripton
with
hallam
mr
hallam
exclaimed
gypsy
mr
guy
hallam
was
a
lawyer
about
thirty
years
old
but
tom
had
the
natural
boy
feeling
about
mistering
any
one
that
he
had
gone
on
fishing
excursions
with
ever
since
he
could
remember
while
gypsy
was
more
respectful
ripton
said
gypsy
again
oh
dear
me
and
going
to
camp
out
and
have
a
fire
and
cook
our
trout
and
shoot
our
rabbits
said
tom
with
an
aggravating
appearance
of
indifference
as
if
these
were
only
a
specimen
of
innumerable
delights
unmentioned
oh
dear
said
gypsy
with
a
long
sigh
there
are
several
disadvantages
in
being
a
girl
my
dear
as
you
will
find
out
occasionally
said
tom
with
a
lordly
air
girls
are
just
as
good
as
boys
answered
gypsy
flashing
up
only
they
ca
camp
out
i
not
so
sure
of
that
sir
indeed
girls
do
camp
out
i
heard
about
it
parties
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
go
out
up
on
the
adirondacks
you
might
take
sarah
rowe
and
me
tom
smiled
a
very
superior
smile
come
tom
do
there
a
good
fellow
take
along
a
couple
of
girls
that
ca
fish
and
scream
when
you
shoot
a
squirrel
and
are
always
having
headaches
and
spraining
their
ankles
and
afraid
to
be
left
alone
no
thank
you
i
can
fish
and
i
no
more
afraid
to
be
left
alone
than
you
are
said
gypsy
indignantly
i
go
and
ask
mother
she
ran
down
stairs
slamming
all
the
doors
and
rushed
noisily
into
the
parlor
oh
mother
tom
going
to
camp
out
with
mr
guy
hallam
and
ca
sarah
and
i
go
too
oh
what
now
said
breynton
laughing
and
laying
down
her
work
only
for
a
week
mother
up
ripton
just
think
with
a
tent
and
a
fire
and
hallam
to
take
care
of
us
this
last
remark
was
a
stroke
of
policy
on
gypsy
part
for
tom
had
come
in
and
it
touched
a
bit
of
boy
pride
of
which
gypsy
was
perfectly
aware
he
had
a
good
deal
as
if
i
could
take
as
good
care
of
you
as
guy
hallam
or
the
next
man
he
said
in
an
insulted
tone
then
tom
is
willing
you
should
go
observed
breynton
why
i
do
know
said
tom
who
had
not
intended
to
commit
himself
i
did
say
so
but
you
will
say
so
now
there
a
dear
good
tom
said
gypsy
giving
him
a
soft
kiss
on
one
cheek
gypsy
did
not
very
often
kiss
tom
unless
he
asked
her
and
it
was
the
best
argument
she
could
have
used
for
though
tom
always
pretended
to
be
quite
above
any
interest
in
such
tender
proceedings
yet
this
rogue
of
a
sister
looked
so
pink
and
pretty
and
merry
with
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
her
twinkling
eyes
looking
into
his
that
there
was
no
resisting
her
gypsy
was
quite
conscious
of
this
little
despotism
and
was
enough
of
a
diplomatist
to
reserve
it
for
rare
and
important
occasions
we
ell
said
tom
slowly
i
do
know
as
i
care
if
hallam
does
just
for
once
you
understand
you
not
to
ask
me
again
as
long
as
you
live
there
there
cried
gypsy
clapping
her
hands
and
jumping
up
and
down
tom
you
are
a
cherub
a
wingless
cherub
now
mother
but
supposing
it
rains
suggested
breynton
oh
we
take
our
the
tent
will
be
dry
enough
put
in
tom
bringing
in
his
forces
like
a
good
soldier
now
he
was
fairly
enlisted
but
if
you
catch
cold
and
get
sick
my
dear
tom
wo
want
to
cut
short
his
excursion
to
bring
you
home
there
fisher
right
on
top
of
the
mountain
he
bring
me
in
his
wagon
besides
i
would
be
silly
enough
to
get
sick
but
sarah
might
sarah
does
as
i
tell
her
said
gypsy
significantly
i
should
take
care
of
her
but
rowe
may
not
be
willing
sarah
should
go
and
mr
guy
hallam
must
be
asked
gypsy
well
but
persisted
gypsy
if
rowe
and
hallam
and
everybody
are
willing
may
i
go
well
said
breynton
after
a
few
minutes
thinking
i
guess
so
if
tom
will
take
good
care
of
you
and
if
you
will
promise
to
go
to
fisher
the
rainy
nights
i
mean
if
it
rains
hard
oh
mother
mother
breynton
there
never
was
such
a
dear
little
woman
in
this
world
why
my
said
breynton
when
he
heard
of
it
how
can
you
let
the
child
do
such
a
thing
she
will
fall
off
the
precipice
or
walk
right
into
a
bear
den
the
first
thing
oh
i
trust
her
answered
her
mother
smiling
and
then
fisher
will
be
so
near
and
so
ready
to
take
care
of
her
if
it
is
cold
or
wet
it
is
as
if
she
were
going
off
into
a
wild
place
of
course
then
i
should
let
her
go
without
some
grown
woman
with
them
well
my
dear
i
suppose
you
know
best
i
believe
i
agreed
to
let
you
do
as
you
pleased
with
your
girl
seeing
she
the
only
one
rowe
was
willing
if
breynton
were
willing
mr
guy
hallam
had
no
objections
sarah
was
delighted
gypsy
radiant
tom
patronizing
and
winnie
envious
and
so
amid
a
pleasant
little
bustle
the
preparations
began
and
one
sunny
morning
the
party
stowed
themselves
and
their
baggage
comfortably
away
in
surly
wagon
much
to
the
horror
of
his
excellent
wife
who
looked
out
of
the
window
and
wondered
if
miss
rowe
did
expect
that
wild
young
un
of
hers
to
come
home
alive
and
trotted
briskly
out
of
yorkbury
along
the
steep
uneven
road
that
led
to
the
mountain
ripton
was
a
long
ride
from
yorkbury
and
the
wagon
was
somewhat
crowded
owing
to
the
presence
of
surly
who
was
by
no
means
a
thin
man
and
who
acted
as
driver
he
was
to
return
with
his
team
as
the
vermont
farmers
invariably
call
their
vehicles
and
when
the
party
were
ready
to
come
home
fisher
was
to
be
hired
to
bring
them
down
it
would
have
been
unsafe
for
any
but
an
experienced
driver
to
hold
the
reins
on
those
mountain
roads
as
gypsy
was
convinced
afresh
before
the
ride
was
over
for
the
first
few
miles
the
way
led
along
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
otter
creek
and
then
grew
suddenly
steep
as
they
began
to
ascend
the
mountain
such
beautiful
pictures
unfolded
before
them
as
they
wound
slowly
up
that
even
gypsy
did
not
feel
like
talking
and
it
was
a
very
silent
party
they
passed
through
pine
forests
dense
and
still
where
the
wind
was
hoarse
and
startled
squirrels
flew
over
the
fallen
trunks
and
boughs
of
ruined
trees
they
rode
close
to
the
edge
of
sheer
precipices
four
hundred
feet
down
with
like
silver
threads
winding
through
the
gorges
great
walls
of
rock
rose
above
and
around
them
and
seemed
to
shut
them
in
with
a
frown
sharp
turns
in
the
road
brought
them
suddenly
to
the
edge
of
abysses
from
which
in
dark
nights
they
might
have
easily
ridden
off
gay
flowers
perfumed
the
fresh
high
winds
and
rank
mosses
grew
and
twined
and
hung
thickly
upon
old
stones
and
logs
and
roadside
banks
where
the
mountain
sloped
steeply
far
above
were
the
tops
of
those
tall
sentinel
trees
called
by
vermonters
the
procession
of
pines
the
tower
above
their
lesser
comrades
two
by
two
regular
solemn
and
dark
against
the
sky
for
miles
of
between
these
were
patches
and
glimpses
of
a
sky
without
a
cloud
gypsy
had
seen
it
all
many
times
before
but
it
was
always
new
and
grand
to
her
it
always
made
the
blood
leap
in
her
veins
and
the
stars
twinkle
in
her
eyes
and
set
her
happy
heart
to
dreaming
a
world
of
pleasant
dreams
she
was
leaning
back
against
the
with
her
face
upturned
to
watch
the
leaves
flutter
in
the
distant
when
surly
reined
up
suddenly
and
the
wagon
stopped
with
a
jerk
i
declare
said
mr
guy
hallam
waal
this
is
of
a
fix
neow
said
surly
climbing
out
over
the
wheel
what
the
matter
asked
gypsy
and
sarah
in
one
breath
jumping
up
to
see
matter
enough
said
tom
for
turning
a
sharp
corner
just
ahead
of
them
was
a
huge
drawn
by
two
struggling
horses
the
road
was
just
wide
enough
for
one
vehicle
where
their
wagon
stood
it
would
have
been
simply
impossible
to
place
two
abreast
at
their
right
the
wooded
slope
rose
like
a
wall
at
their
left
a
gorge
two
hundred
feet
deep
yawned
horribly
and
the
gurgled
over
its
stones
you
hold
on
there
shouted
the
driver
of
the
i
turn
in
here
anigh
the
mountain
you
ken
git
by
side
ca
you
reckon
so
said
surly
measuring
the
distance
with
his
eye
he
climbed
in
again
and
took
the
reins
and
the
driver
of
the
wheeled
up
into
a
widening
of
the
road
where
a
had
been
dug
away
the
space
left
was
just
wide
enough
for
a
carriage
to
pass
closely
without
grazing
the
wheels
of
the
or
the
low
log
which
formed
the
only
fence
on
the
edge
of
the
ravine
oh
we
shall
certainly
tip
over
and
be
killed
oh
dear
let
me
get
out
cried
sarah
as
the
wagon
passed
slowly
forward
hush
up
said
gypsy
quickly
tom
wo
let
us
go
if
you
act
so
you
suppose
four
grown
men
know
better
than
we
do
whether
it
safe
not
afraid
a
bit
nevertheless
gypsy
and
tom
and
even
hallam
looked
narrowly
at
the
old
frail
log
and
down
into
the
gorge
where
the
water
was
gurgling
once
the
wheels
grazed
the
log
and
it
tilted
slightly
sarah
screamed
aloud
surly
knew
what
he
was
about
however
and
knew
how
to
do
it
he
passed
on
safely
into
the
wider
road
and
the
rattled
composedly
on
there
a
ben
a
purty
close
shave
in
the
night
he
remarked
coolly
pointing
with
his
whip
down
the
precipice
there
was
a
team
went
down
here
five
years
ago
jist
off
that
there
horse
wagin
and
all
two
men
brothers
they
was
too
one
man
hung
onto
a
branch
or
and
was
ketched
and
saved
one
got
crushed
to
jelly
it
was
a
terrible
dark
night
even
gypsy
gave
a
little
shiver
during
this
entertaining
conversation
and
was
glad
they
had
come
up
in
the
daytime
surly
drove
to
a
certain
in
the
woods
where
he
left
them
and
returned
home
and
the
party
proceeded
on
foot
with
their
baggage
to
the
place
hallam
had
chosen
as
a
it
was
a
pleasant
spot
far
enough
in
the
woods
to
be
still
and
wild
near
enough
to
the
little
settlement
on
top
of
the
mountain
to
be
free
from
bears
as
sarah
had
required
to
be
informed
ten
separate
times
on
the
way
there
was
a
little
natural
clearing
among
the
trees
which
hallam
and
tom
made
larger
by
cutting
down
the
shrubbery
and
saplings
they
had
brought
hatchets
with
them
as
well
as
guns
knives
and
it
seemed
very
warlike
and
real
gypsy
thought
quite
as
if
they
intended
to
spend
the
rest
of
their
lives
there
she
almost
wished
a
party
of
indians
would
come
and
attack
them
or
a
bear
or
a
wolf
having
selected
a
smooth
level
spot
for
the
tents
hallam
thought
they
had
better
put
them
up
immediately
it
chanced
that
he
and
tom
each
owned
one
which
was
a
much
better
arrangement
than
the
dividing
of
one
into
two
apartments
the
two
were
placed
side
by
side
and
the
girls
tent
was
distinguished
and
honored
by
a
bit
of
a
flag
on
top
and
an
extra
fold
of
in
front
to
keep
out
the
rain
there
was
also
a
ditch
dug
around
it
to
drain
off
the
water
in
case
of
a
severe
storm
besides
if
it
rains
very
hard
they
can
be
sent
to
fisher
said
tom
catch
me
said
gypsy
why
it
would
be
all
the
fun
to
sleep
out
in
the
rain
while
hallam
and
tom
were
setting
up
the
tents
and
it
took
a
long
time
the
two
girls
busied
themselves
unpacking
the
baggage
they
were
really
astonished
to
find
how
much
they
had
brought
when
it
was
all
taken
out
of
the
baskets
and
boxes
and
bags
and
each
article
provided
with
a
place
within
or
without
the
tents
to
begin
with
the
little
girls
had
each
a
bag
of
such
things
as
were
likely
to
be
necessary
for
their
mountain
toilet
consisting
principally
of
dry
stockings
for
as
gypsy
said
they
expected
to
wet
their
feet
three
or
four
times
a
day
and
she
should
enjoy
it
for
once
then
they
had
brought
their
long
waterproof
cloaks
in
which
they
considered
themselves
safe
from
a
deluge
there
were
plenty
of
and
tin
pans
and
kettles
and
knives
and
steel
forks
and
matches
and
scissors
and
twine
and
needles
and
the
endless
variety
of
accoutrements
necessary
to
a
state
of
there
were
plates
and
mugs
and
pewter
teaspoons
breynton
would
not
consent
to
letting
her
silver
ones
go
and
gypsy
thought
the
others
were
better
because
it
seemed
more
like
being
wild
indeed
she
would
have
dispensed
with
spoons
altogether
but
sarah
gave
a
little
scream
at
the
idea
and
thought
she
could
possibly
eat
a
meal
without
then
the
provision
basket
was
full
of
bread
and
butter
and
cake
and
pies
and
summer
apples
and
salt
and
pepper
and
indian
meal
and
coffee
and
eggs
and
raw
meat
and
fresh
vegetables
they
expected
however
to
live
chiefly
on
the
trout
which
hallam
and
tom
were
to
catch
and
fisher
would
supply
them
with
fresh
milk
from
her
dairy
the
girls
made
their
toilet
arrangements
in
one
corner
of
their
tent
a
rough
box
served
as
a
and
sarah
had
brought
a
bit
of
a
which
she
put
on
top
of
it
they
collected
piles
of
sweet
dry
leaves
for
a
bed
and
a
certain
thoughtful
mother
had
tucked
into
their
bags
a
pair
of
sheets
and
a
blanket
so
they
were
nicely
fitted
out
gypsy
had
a
secret
apprehension
that
they
were
preparing
for
a
very
luxurious
sort
of
after
a
little
consultation
they
decided
to
make
two
rooms
out
of
their
tent
as
they
were
sadly
in
need
of
a
kitchen
accordingly
they
took
their
heavy
blanket
shawls
tied
them
together
by
the
fringe
and
hung
them
up
as
a
curtain
across
the
middle
of
the
tent
the
front
apartment
served
nicely
as
a
kitchen
and
the
provisions
and
crockery
were
moved
in
there
in
spite
of
tom
ungallant
remark
that
he
and
hallam
should
never
see
any
of
the
pies
he
knew
by
way
of
recompense
he
took
the
guns
and
all
dangerous
implements
under
his
own
care
the
afternoon
was
nearly
spent
when
their
preparations
were
at
last
completed
and
they
were
ready
to
begin
let
have
supper
said
gypsy
gypsy
was
always
ready
to
have
supper
whenever
was
passed
we
have
a
single
trout
said
tom
it
is
rather
late
to
fish
said
hallam
the
little
girls
are
tired
and
hungry
indeed
we
all
are
for
that
matter
and
i
guess
we
will
have
supper
gypsy
installed
herself
as
and
she
and
sarah
lost
no
time
in
unpacking
the
cake
and
bread
and
butter
tom
collected
some
light
dry
brushwood
for
a
fire
and
he
and
hallam
made
the
coffee
it
seemed
as
if
no
supper
had
ever
tasted
as
that
supper
did
the
free
mountain
air
was
so
fresh
and
strong
and
the
breath
of
the
pines
so
sweet
it
was
so
pleasant
to
sit
on
the
moss
around
a
fire
and
eat
with
your
fingers
if
you
chose
without
shocking
anybody
then
the
woods
looked
so
wide
and
lonely
and
still
and
it
was
so
strange
to
watch
the
great
red
sunset
dying
like
a
fire
through
the
thick
green
where
the
and
the
maple
interlaced
for
about
five
minutes
after
supper
was
cleared
away
when
the
great
shadows
began
to
darken
among
the
trees
sarah
discoursed
in
a
vague
scientific
way
about
the
habits
of
bears
and
gypsy
had
a
dim
notion
that
she
should
so
very
much
object
to
see
her
mother
come
walking
up
the
mountain
seized
with
an
uncontrollable
desire
to
spend
a
night
in
a
tent
but
tom
was
so
pleasant
and
merry
and
hallam
told
such
funny
stories
that
they
were
laughing
before
they
knew
it
and
the
evening
passed
happily
away
gypsy
could
not
sleep
for
some
time
that
night
for
delight
at
spending
a
night
out
doors
in
a
real
tent
on
a
real
mountain
that
was
known
to
have
an
occasional
real
bear
on
it
she
did
not
feel
afraid
in
the
least
although
sarah
had
a
very
uncomfortable
way
of
asking
her
every
ten
minutes
if
she
were
perfectly
it
was
safe
oh
do
said
gypsy
at
last
i
am
having
such
a
good
time
thinking
that
i
really
here
you
go
to
sleep
sarah
was
so
much
accustomed
to
doing
as
gypsy
told
her
that
she
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
without
another
word
it
was
not
a
good
thing
for
gypsy
to
be
so
much
with
just
such
a
girl
as
sarah
she
was
physically
the
weaker
of
the
two
as
well
as
the
more
timid
and
she
had
fallen
into
a
habit
of
obeying
and
gypsy
of
commanding
by
a
sort
of
mutual
tacit
agreement
it
was
partly
for
this
reason
as
was
natural
enough
that
gypsy
chose
her
so
often
for
a
companion
but
principally
because
sarah
never
refused
any
romp
or
adventure
other
timid
girls
liked
to
have
their
own
way
and
choose
their
own
quiet
plays
sarah
timidity
yielded
to
gypsy
stronger
will
if
gypsy
took
a
fancy
to
climb
a
ruined
windmill
sarah
would
scream
all
the
way
but
follow
if
gypsy
wanted
to
run
at
full
speed
down
a
dangerous
steep
hill
where
there
were
walls
to
be
leaped
and
loose
rolling
stones
to
be
dodged
sarah
scolded
a
little
but
went
a
girl
more
selfish
than
gypsy
would
have
been
ruined
by
this
sort
of
companionship
her
frank
impulsive
generosity
saved
her
from
becoming
tyrannical
or
dictatorial
the
worst
of
it
was
that
she
was
forced
to
form
such
a
habit
of
always
taking
the
lead
she
lay
awake
some
time
that
night
after
sarah
had
fallen
asleep
listening
to
the
strange
whispers
of
the
wind
in
the
trees
and
making
plans
for
until
at
last
her
happy
thoughts
faded
into
happy
dreams
she
did
not
know
how
long
she
had
been
asleep
when
something
suddenly
woke
her
she
was
a
little
startled
at
first
by
the
unfamiliar
sight
of
the
and
narrow
walled
space
which
shut
her
in
the
wind
was
sighing
drearily
through
the
forest
the
distant
scream
of
an
owl
had
an
ugly
sound
and
why
no
but
yes
another
sound
more
ugly
than
the
cry
of
a
was
distinct
at
the
door
of
the
tent
the
sound
of
a
quick
panting
breath
gypsy
sat
upright
in
bed
and
listened
it
grew
louder
and
came
nearer
quick
and
hoarse
and
horrible
like
the
breathing
of
a
hungry
animal
sarah
slept
like
a
baby
there
was
not
a
movement
from
tom
and
hallam
in
the
other
tent
everything
was
still
but
that
terrible
sound
gypsy
had
good
nerves
and
was
not
easily
frightened
but
it
must
be
confessed
she
thought
of
those
traditionary
bears
which
had
been
seen
at
ripton
she
had
but
a
moment
in
which
to
decide
what
to
do
for
the
creature
was
now
sniffing
at
the
and
once
she
was
sure
she
saw
a
dark
paw
lift
the
she
might
wake
sarah
but
what
was
the
use
she
would
only
scream
and
that
would
do
no
good
and
might
do
much
harm
if
it
were
a
bear
and
they
kept
still
he
might
go
away
and
leave
them
yet
if
it
were
a
bear
tom
must
know
it
in
some
way
all
these
thoughts
passed
through
gypsy
mind
in
that
one
instant
while
she
sat
listening
to
the
panting
of
the
brute
without
then
she
rose
quickly
and
went
on
tiptoe
to
the
her
hand
trembled
a
little
as
she
touched
the
canvas
gently
so
gently
that
it
scarcely
stirred
she
held
her
breath
she
put
her
eye
to
the
partition
she
looked
out
and
saw
fisher
little
black
dog
tom
was
awakened
by
a
long
merry
laugh
that
rang
out
like
a
bell
on
the
still
night
air
and
echoed
through
the
forest
he
thought
gypsy
must
be
having
another
fit
of
somnambulism
and
sarah
jumped
up
with
a
scream
and
asked
if
it
was
an
indian
the
night
passed
without
further
adventure
and
the
morning
sun
woke
the
girls
by
peering
in
at
a
hole
in
the
and
making
a
little
round
golden
fleck
that
danced
across
their
eyelids
until
they
opened
they
were
scarcely
dressed
when
tom
voice
with
a
spice
of
mischief
in
it
called
gypsy
from
outside
the
girls
hurried
out
and
there
he
sat
with
hallam
before
a
crackling
fire
over
which
some
large
fresh
trout
were
frying
in
indian
meal
oh
why
did
you
let
us
go
too
said
gypsy
we
took
the
time
while
you
were
asleep
on
purpose
said
tom
in
his
provoking
fashion
nobody
can
do
any
fishing
while
girls
are
round
tom
does
deserve
any
for
that
speech
said
hallam
smiling
and
i
shall
have
to
tell
of
him
it
happens
that
i
caught
the
fish
while
a
certain
young
gentleman
was
dreaming
o
oh
tom
well
but
hallam
ca
we
go
fishing
to
be
sure
you
can
how
long
do
you
suppose
you
stand
it
girls
always
give
out
in
half
an
hour
i
stand
it
as
long
as
you
will
sir
tom
whistled
the
trout
were
done
to
that
indescribable
luscious
point
of
brown
crispness
and
the
breakfast
was
if
possible
better
than
the
supper
after
breakfast
they
started
on
a
fishing
excursion
down
the
gorge
it
was
a
perfect
day
it
seemed
to
the
girls
that
no
winds
from
the
valley
were
ever
so
sweet
and
pure
as
those
winds
and
no
lowland
sunshine
so
golden
the
brook
foamed
and
bubbled
down
its
steep
rocky
bed
splashed
up
jets
of
rainbow
spray
into
the
air
and
plunged
in
miniature
cascades
over
tiny
gullies
the
wet
stones
flashed
in
the
light
upon
the
banks
and
tall
daisies
peering
over
painted
shifting
white
outlines
of
themselves
in
the
swelling
current
and
the
shallow
pools
here
and
there
too
where
the
water
was
deep
the
fish
darted
to
the
surface
and
darted
out
of
sight
is
it
tiful
cried
sarah
pretty
enough
said
gypsy
affecting
carelessness
and
trying
to
unwind
her
line
in
as
and
boyish
a
manner
as
possible
you
girls
keep
this
pool
hallam
and
i
are
going
a
little
ways
up
stream
said
tom
now
do
speak
a
word
and
be
sure
you
do
scream
if
you
catch
a
fish
by
any
chance
between
you
and
frighten
them
all
away
as
if
i
did
know
that
here
sarah
hold
your
rod
lower
said
gypsy
assuming
a
professional
air
hallam
and
tom
walked
away
and
the
girls
fished
for
just
half
an
hour
in
silence
that
is
to
say
they
sat
on
the
bank
and
held
a
rod
sarah
had
had
one
faint
nibble
but
that
was
all
that
had
happened
and
the
sun
began
to
be
very
warm
i
going
out
on
those
stones
said
gypsy
i
believe
i
see
a
fish
out
there
so
she
stepped
out
carefully
on
the
loose
stones
which
tilted
ominously
under
her
weight
oh
you
fall
said
sarah
hush
sh
i
see
one
up
went
the
rod
in
the
air
with
a
jerk
over
went
the
stone
and
down
went
gypsy
she
disappeared
from
sight
a
moment
in
the
shallow
water
then
splashed
up
with
a
gasp
and
stood
dripping
oh
dear
me
said
sarah
tom
came
up
undecided
whether
to
laugh
or
scold
well
gypsy
breynton
you
done
it
now
now
i
suppose
you
must
go
directly
home
and
you
catch
cold
before
you
can
get
there
this
is
a
pretty
fix
n
no
gasped
gypsy
rubbing
the
water
out
of
her
eyes
i
have
dry
clothes
up
in
the
tent
mother
said
i
should
want
them
i
guess
i
go
right
up
i
rather
wet
i
believe
tom
looked
at
his
watch
as
gypsy
toiled
dripping
up
the
bank
the
temptation
was
too
great
to
be
resisted
and
he
called
out
precisely
half
an
hour
gypsy
my
dear
i
stay
all
long
as
the
boys
do
by
all
means
it
was
a
very
good
thing
about
gypsy
that
she
was
quite
able
to
relish
a
joke
at
her
own
expense
she
laughed
as
merrily
as
tom
did
and
the
morning
adventure
made
quite
as
much
fun
as
they
would
have
gained
from
a
string
of
perfectly
respectable
fishes
properly
and
scientifically
caught
with
dry
feet
and
a
warm
seat
on
the
bank
under
a
glaring
sun
hallam
and
tom
brought
up
plenty
for
dinner
so
no
one
went
hungry
that
afternoon
it
chanced
that
the
girls
were
left
alone
for
about
one
hour
hallam
had
taken
tom
some
distance
up
the
stream
for
a
comfortable
little
fish
by
themselves
and
left
the
girls
to
prepare
supper
with
strict
injunctions
not
to
go
out
of
sight
of
the
tents
they
were
very
well
content
with
the
arrangement
for
a
while
but
at
last
gypsy
became
tired
of
having
nothing
but
the
trees
to
look
at
and
suggested
a
visit
to
the
brook
she
had
seen
some
leaves
growing
in
the
gorge
and
was
seized
with
a
fancy
to
have
them
for
supper
sarah
as
usual
made
no
objections
and
they
went
it
only
just
out
of
sight
of
the
tent
said
gypsy
as
they
ran
down
over
the
loose
stones
and
we
wo
be
gone
but
a
minute
but
they
were
gone
many
minutes
they
had
little
idea
how
long
the
time
had
been
and
were
surprised
to
find
it
growing
rapidly
dark
in
the
forest
when
they
came
panting
back
to
the
tent
out
of
breath
with
the
haste
they
had
made
they
must
be
back
by
this
time
said
gypsy
tom
there
was
no
answer
tom
mr
hallam
a
bird
chirped
in
a
overhead
and
a
spark
cracked
out
of
the
smouldering
hickory
fire
there
was
no
other
sound
i
guess
they
busy
in
their
tent
said
gypsy
going
up
to
it
but
the
tent
was
empty
they
have
come
exclaimed
sarah
it
real
mean
in
them
to
leave
us
here
said
gypsy
looking
round
among
the
trees
you
know
suggested
sarah
timidly
you
know
hallam
said
we
were
to
stay
at
the
tents
perhaps
they
came
while
we
were
gone
and
could
find
us
and
have
gone
to
hunt
us
up
oh
said
gypsy
quickly
i
forgot
she
turned
away
her
face
a
moment
so
that
sarah
could
not
see
it
then
she
turned
back
and
said
slowly
sarah
i
very
sorry
i
took
you
off
this
is
rather
a
bad
fix
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
now
let
call
again
said
sarah
faintly
they
called
again
and
many
times
but
there
was
no
reply
everything
was
still
but
the
bird
and
the
sparks
that
crackled
now
and
then
from
the
fire
the
heavy
gray
shadows
grew
purple
and
grew
black
the
little
in
the
woods
were
blotted
out
of
sight
and
the
far
sky
above
the
grew
dusky
and
dim
we
might
go
to
fisher
do
gypsy
i
ca
bear
to
stay
here
said
sarah
looking
around
no
said
gypsy
decidedly
we
ca
go
to
fisher
because
that
would
mislead
them
all
the
more
we
must
stay
here
now
till
they
come
i
afraid
said
sarah
clinging
to
her
arm
it
is
so
dark
perhaps
we
have
to
stay
here
alone
all
night
oh
gypsy
nonsense
said
gypsy
looking
as
bold
as
possible
it
would
be
so
dreadful
if
we
did
besides
of
course
we
they
be
back
here
before
long
you
go
in
the
tent
if
you
feel
any
safer
there
and
make
up
a
bright
fire
if
they
see
it
they
know
we
come
sarah
went
into
the
tent
and
covered
her
head
up
in
the
but
in
about
ten
minutes
she
came
back
feeling
a
little
ashamed
of
her
timidity
and
sat
down
by
gypsy
before
the
fire
it
was
a
strange
picture
the
ghostly
white
tents
and
tangled
brushwood
gilded
with
the
light
the
great
forest
stretching
away
darkly
beyond
the
fitful
shadows
and
glares
from
the
flickering
fire
that
chased
each
other
in
strange
uncouth
shapes
among
the
leaves
and
the
two
children
sitting
there
alone
with
frightened
watching
eyes
i
not
a
bit
afraid
said
gypsy
after
a
silence
in
a
tone
as
if
she
were
rather
arguing
with
herself
than
with
sarah
i
think
it
rather
nice
tom
left
his
gun
all
loaded
and
we
can
defend
ourselves
against
anything
i
going
to
get
it
and
we
play
we
union
refugees
hiding
in
the
south
so
she
went
into
tom
tent
and
brought
out
his
gun
look
out
said
sarah
shrinking
it
may
go
off
go
off
of
course
it
ca
unless
i
pull
the
trigger
i
know
how
to
manage
a
gun
hark
what
that
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
sarah
beginning
to
cry
i
know
it
a
bear
hush
let
listen
they
listened
a
curious
irregular
tramping
round
broke
the
stillness
gypsy
stood
up
quickly
and
put
the
gun
into
position
upon
her
shoulder
it
is
tom
and
hallam
then
there
would
be
two
this
is
only
one
and
it
does
sound
like
a
man
i
declare
oh
it
a
bear
it
a
bear
we
shall
be
eaten
up
alive
oh
gypsy
gypsy
keep
still
i
can
shoot
him
if
it
is
but
i
know
it
is
just
wait
and
see
the
curious
sound
came
nearer
tramped
through
the
underbrush
crushed
the
dead
twigs
gypsy
finger
was
on
the
trigger
her
face
a
little
pale
she
thought
the
idea
of
the
bear
all
nonsense
she
did
not
know
what
she
feared
the
very
mystery
of
the
thing
had
thoroughly
frightened
her
keep
still
sarah
you
hit
me
i
do
want
to
fire
till
i
see
oh
it
coming
it
coming
cried
sarah
starting
back
with
a
scream
she
clung
in
her
terror
to
gypsy
arm
jerked
it
the
trigger
snapped
and
a
loud
explosion
echoed
and
and
reverberated
among
the
trees
it
was
followed
by
a
sound
the
most
horrible
gypsy
had
heard
in
all
her
life
it
was
a
human
cry
was
tom
chapter
x
the
end
of
the
week
gypsy
threw
down
the
gun
and
threw
up
her
hands
with
a
curious
quick
motion
like
one
in
suffocation
who
was
trying
to
find
a
voice
but
she
did
not
utter
a
sound
there
was
an
instant
awful
stillness
in
that
instant
it
seemed
to
gypsy
as
if
she
had
lived
a
great
many
years
in
that
instant
even
sarah
frightened
cries
were
frozen
then
the
bushes
parted
and
some
one
sprang
through
gypsy
knew
the
face
all
blackened
and
marred
with
powder
the
face
dearer
to
her
than
any
on
earth
but
her
mother
so
she
had
not
killed
him
thank
god
thank
god
gypsy
child
called
the
dear
familiar
voice
what
ails
you
you
have
hurt
me
but
why
in
the
name
of
all
danger
on
this
earth
did
you
touch
but
tom
stopped
short
for
gypsy
tottered
up
to
him
with
such
a
white
weak
look
on
her
face
that
he
thought
the
rebound
of
the
gun
must
have
injured
her
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
you
not
going
to
faint
where
are
you
hurt
but
gypsy
was
not
hurt
and
gypsy
never
fainted
she
just
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
hid
her
face
close
upon
his
shoulder
and
cried
as
if
her
heart
would
break
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
spoke
only
kissing
him
and
clinging
to
him
through
her
sobs
then
at
last
oh
tom
i
thought
i
had
killed
you
i
thought
and
i
loved
you
so
oh
tom
tom
choked
a
little
and
sat
down
on
the
ground
holding
her
in
his
lap
why
my
little
gypsy
just
then
footsteps
came
crashing
through
the
underbrush
and
hallam
ran
hurriedly
up
oh
you
found
them
where
were
they
what
has
happened
to
gypsy
let
me
go
sobbed
gypsy
i
ca
talk
just
now
i
want
to
go
away
and
cry
she
broke
away
from
tom
arms
and
into
the
tent
where
she
could
be
alone
what
has
happened
repeated
hallam
we
came
home
in
less
than
an
hour
and
could
find
you
we
have
been
to
fisher
and
hunted
everywhere
i
was
calling
for
you
in
the
gorge
when
tom
found
you
sarah
was
left
to
tell
their
story
which
she
did
with
remarkable
justness
considering
how
frightened
she
was
she
shared
with
gypsy
the
blame
of
having
left
the
tents
and
insisted
that
it
was
her
fault
that
the
gun
went
off
before
the
account
was
quite
finished
gypsy
called
tom
from
the
and
he
went
to
her
she
was
quiet
and
very
pale
oh
tom
i
am
so
sorry
i
did
think
i
should
be
gone
so
long
it
was
very
dangerous
gypsy
you
might
have
been
lost
or
you
might
have
had
to
spend
the
night
here
alone
while
we
were
hunting
for
you
i
know
it
i
know
it
and
sarah
was
so
frightened
and
i
was
too
a
little
and
sarah
thought
you
were
a
bear
i
have
told
you
a
great
many
times
that
it
is
safe
for
you
to
touch
my
gun
said
tom
gravely
he
felt
that
gypsy
carelessness
might
have
brought
about
too
terrible
consequences
both
to
herself
and
to
him
to
be
passed
by
lightly
and
he
had
an
idea
that
as
long
as
her
mother
was
not
there
to
tell
her
so
he
must
but
gypsy
dropped
her
head
and
looked
so
humble
and
wretched
that
he
had
not
the
heart
to
say
any
more
gypsy
was
sure
all
the
pleasure
of
her
was
utterly
spoiled
but
there
was
a
bright
sun
the
next
morning
and
tom
was
so
kind
and
pleasant
and
the
birds
were
singing
and
the
world
did
look
at
all
as
if
she
had
nearly
killed
her
brother
twelve
hours
before
so
she
found
she
was
laughing
in
spite
of
herself
and
two
very
happy
days
passed
after
that
hallam
made
a
rule
that
he
or
tom
should
keep
the
girls
constantly
in
sight
and
that
during
the
time
spent
in
excursions
which
they
could
not
join
they
should
remain
in
fisher
house
he
said
it
was
too
wild
a
place
for
them
to
be
alone
in
for
any
length
of
time
and
he
was
sorry
he
left
them
before
gypsy
did
not
resent
this
strict
tutelage
she
was
very
humble
and
obedient
and
careful
as
long
as
they
stayed
upon
the
mountain
those
few
moments
when
she
clung
sobbing
to
tom
neck
were
a
lesson
to
her
she
will
not
forget
them
as
long
as
she
lives
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
day
just
at
supper
time
a
dark
cloud
sailed
over
the
sky
and
a
faint
wind
blew
from
the
east
i
wonder
if
it
going
to
rain
said
hallam
they
all
looked
up
gypsy
said
nothing
in
her
secret
heart
she
hoped
it
would
what
about
sending
the
girls
to
mrs
fisher
asked
tom
when
they
were
washing
the
dishes
oh
no
no
it
wo
rain
i
know
let
us
stay
hallam
please
why
i
should
feel
like
a
deserter
if
i
went
off
pleaded
gypsy
the
dark
cloud
seemed
to
have
passed
away
and
the
wind
was
still
after
thinking
a
while
hallam
decided
to
let
them
stay
in
the
middle
of
the
night
gypsy
was
awakened
by
a
great
noise
the
wind
was
blowing
a
miniature
hurricane
through
the
trees
and
the
rain
was
falling
in
torrents
she
could
hear
it
spatter
on
the
canvas
roof
and
drop
from
the
poles
and
gurgle
in
a
stream
through
the
ditch
she
could
hear
too
the
loud
angry
murmur
of
the
trout
brook
and
the
splashing
of
hundreds
of
rivulets
that
dashed
down
the
slope
and
over
the
gorge
into
it
she
gave
sarah
a
little
pinch
and
woke
her
up
oh
sarah
it
come
it
raining
like
everything
and
here
we
are
and
we
ca
get
to
fisher
is
it
splendid
said
sarah
it
very
splendid
only
is
it
a
little
wet
it
dropping
right
on
my
cheek
oh
that
nothing
why
here
i
can
put
my
hand
right
down
into
a
puddle
of
water
it
just
like
being
at
sea
i
know
it
are
people
at
sea
always
so
cold
why
i
not
cold
only
we
might
as
well
wear
our
the
leaves
a
little
damp
so
they
put
on
their
tweed
cloaks
and
gypsy
listened
to
the
wind
and
thought
it
was
very
poetic
and
romantic
and
that
she
was
perfectly
happy
and
just
as
she
had
lain
down
again
there
came
a
great
gust
of
rain
and
one
of
the
rivulets
that
were
sweeping
down
the
mountain
splashed
in
under
the
canvas
and
ran
right
through
the
middle
of
the
tent
like
a
brook
sarah
jumped
up
with
energy
o
oh
it
gone
right
over
my
feet
my
shoes
are
sailing
away
as
true
as
you
live
cried
gypsy
and
sprang
just
in
time
to
save
them
the
and
a
tin
pail
were
fast
following
when
tom
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
called
through
the
wall
of
shawls
girls
you
have
to
go
to
fisher
be
quick
as
you
can
i
do
want
to
a
bit
said
gypsy
who
was
sitting
in
a
pool
of
water
well
i
going
announced
sarah
with
decision
camping
out
is
very
nice
but
drowning
is
another
thing
well
i
suppose
it
be
a
little
dryer
said
gypsy
slowly
the
girls
were
soon
dressed
and
tom
lighted
a
lantern
and
went
with
them
a
few
peals
of
thunder
growled
sullenly
down
the
valley
and
one
bright
flash
of
lightning
glared
far
through
the
forest
sarah
was
afraid
she
should
be
struck
gypsy
was
thinking
how
grand
it
was
and
wished
she
could
be
out
in
a
midnight
storm
every
week
it
was
after
midnight
and
every
one
at
fisher
was
asleep
but
tom
knocked
them
up
and
fisher
was
very
much
amused
and
fisher
was
very
kind
and
hospitable
and
built
up
a
fire
and
said
they
should
be
perfectly
dry
and
warm
before
they
went
to
bed
so
the
girls
bade
tom
and
he
went
back
to
hallam
and
they
feeling
very
cold
and
sleepy
and
drenched
were
glad
enough
to
be
taken
care
of
and
put
to
bed
like
babies
after
fisher
good
motherly
fashion
sarah
said
gypsy
sleepily
just
as
sarah
was
beginning
to
dream
a
and
and
with
a
little
jump
to
keep
awake
long
enough
to
finish
her
sentence
are
a
little
better
on
the
whole
than
a
mud
pud
just
there
she
went
to
sleep
the
next
day
it
poured
from
morning
till
night
that
was
just
what
hallam
and
tom
liked
so
they
fished
all
day
and
the
girls
amused
themselves
as
best
they
might
in
barn
the
day
after
it
rained
in
snatches
and
the
sun
shone
in
little
spasms
between
a
council
of
exigencies
met
in
hallam
tent
and
it
was
unanimously
decided
to
go
home
even
gypsy
began
to
long
for
civilized
life
though
she
declared
that
she
had
never
in
all
her
life
had
such
a
good
time
as
she
had
had
that
week
so
fisher
harnessed
and
drove
them
briskly
down
the
mountain
and
from
afar
off
gypsy
saw
her
mother
face
watching
for
her
at
the
door
a
little
anxious
very
glad
to
see
her
back
chapter
xi
gypsy
opinion
of
boston
just
at
the
end
of
the
vacation
it
was
suddenly
announced
that
miss
melville
was
not
going
to
teach
any
more
how
funny
said
gypsy
last
term
she
expected
to
just
as
much
as
anything
i
do
see
what
the
reason
now
i
shall
have
to
go
to
the
high
school
it
chanced
that
they
were
remodelling
some
of
the
rooms
at
the
high
school
and
the
winter
term
which
would
otherwise
have
commenced
in
september
was
delayed
till
the
first
of
october
gypsy
had
jumped
on
all
the
and
picked
all
the
huckleberries
and
eaten
all
the
early
davises
and
gone
on
all
the
picnics
that
she
could
and
was
just
ready
to
settle
down
contentedly
to
school
and
study
so
the
news
from
miss
melville
was
not
on
the
whole
very
agreeable
what
to
do
with
herself
for
another
long
month
of
vacation
was
more
than
she
knew
she
wandered
about
the
house
and
sat
out
among
the
clovers
and
swung
on
the
gate
in
a
vague
indefinite
sort
of
way
for
two
weeks
then
one
morning
breynton
read
her
a
letter
which
set
her
eyes
on
fire
with
delight
it
was
an
invitation
from
her
aunt
to
spend
a
fortnight
in
boston
it
so
happened
that
gypsy
had
never
been
to
boston
it
was
a
long
day
journey
from
yorkbury
and
breynton
was
not
much
in
favor
of
expensive
travelling
for
the
children
while
they
were
very
young
arguing
that
the
enjoyment
and
usefulness
would
be
doubled
to
them
when
they
were
older
besides
gypsy
uncle
though
he
was
her
father
brother
had
seldom
visited
yorkbury
his
business
kept
him
closely
at
home
and
his
wife
and
daughter
always
went
to
the
seaside
in
summer
so
the
two
families
had
seen
very
little
of
each
other
for
years
breynton
however
thought
it
best
gypsy
should
make
this
visit
and
gypsy
who
had
lived
twelve
years
in
a
state
which
contained
but
one
city
considered
going
to
boston
very
much
as
she
would
have
considered
going
to
paradise
it
took
a
few
days
of
delightful
hurry
and
bustle
to
get
ready
there
was
much
washing
and
mending
and
altering
sewing
on
of
trimmings
and
letting
down
of
tucks
to
be
done
for
her
for
breynton
desired
to
spare
her
the
discomfort
of
feeling
countrified
and
yorkbury
style
was
not
distinctively
la
she
told
gypsy
frankly
that
she
must
expect
to
find
her
cousin
joy
better
dressed
than
herself
but
that
her
wardrobe
should
be
neat
and
tasteful
and
in
as
much
accordance
with
the
prevailing
mode
as
was
practicable
so
she
hoped
she
would
have
too
much
to
be
troubled
by
the
difference
i
hope
i
have
said
gypsy
with
an
emphasis
the
days
passed
so
quickly
that
it
seemed
like
a
dream
when
she
had
at
last
bidden
them
all
kissed
her
mother
just
ten
times
and
was
fairly
seated
alone
in
the
cars
holding
on
very
tightly
to
her
ticket
and
wondering
if
the
men
put
her
trunk
in
although
she
was
so
little
used
to
travelling
having
never
been
farther
than
to
burlington
or
vergennes
in
her
life
yet
she
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
to
take
the
journey
alone
her
mother
felt
sure
she
could
take
care
of
herself
and
her
father
had
given
her
so
many
directions
and
written
such
careful
memoranda
for
her
of
changes
of
cars
refreshment
stations
what
to
do
with
her
check
and
how
to
look
after
her
baggage
that
she
felt
sure
she
could
not
make
a
mistake
being
a
bright
observing
child
fearless
as
a
boy
and
not
in
the
least
inclined
to
worry
she
had
no
trouble
at
all
the
conductor
was
very
kind
an
old
gentleman
who
was
pleased
with
her
twinkling
eyes
and
red
cheeks
gave
her
an
orange
and
helped
look
after
her
baggage
two
old
ladies
gave
her
fennel
and
peppermints
and
before
she
reached
boston
she
was
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
six
babies
a
lapdog
and
a
altogether
it
had
been
a
most
charming
journey
and
she
was
almost
sorry
when
they
reached
the
city
and
the
train
rolled
slowly
into
the
dark
depot
the
passengers
were
crowding
rapidly
out
the
lamps
were
lighted
in
the
car
and
she
felt
a
little
lonely
sitting
still
there
and
waiting
for
her
uncle
she
had
not
waited
but
a
moment
however
when
a
pleasant
whiskered
face
appeared
at
the
and
one
of
those
genial
voices
that
sound
at
once
so
kindly
and
so
careless
called
out
o
ho
so
here
the
girl
glad
to
see
you
child
this
way
the
all
ready
she
was
hurried
into
a
carriage
her
trunk
was
tossed
on
behind
and
then
the
door
was
shut
and
they
were
driven
rapidly
away
through
a
maze
of
crooked
streets
glare
of
gaslights
and
brilliant
that
bewildered
gypsy
she
had
a
notion
that
was
the
way
must
look
her
uncle
laughed
at
her
eyes
boston
is
a
somewhat
bigger
village
than
yorkbury
i
suppose
how
your
father
why
did
he
come
with
you
is
your
mother
well
and
that
boy
linnie
silly
what
do
call
him
winnie
sir
and
then
there
tom
winnie
oh
yes
tom
well
too
before
the
ride
was
over
gypsy
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
she
liked
her
uncle
very
much
only
he
had
such
a
funny
way
of
asking
questions
and
then
forgetting
all
about
them
the
driver
reined
up
at
a
house
on
beacon
street
and
gypsy
was
led
up
a
long
flight
of
steps
through
a
bright
hall
and
into
a
room
that
dazzled
her
a
bright
was
glowing
in
the
grate
for
it
was
a
chilly
evening
and
bright
jets
of
gas
were
burning
in
chandeliers
bright
carpets
and
curtains
furniture
pictures
and
ornaments
covered
the
length
of
two
parlors
separated
only
by
and
mirrors
that
reached
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
reflected
her
figure
full
length
as
she
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
magnificence
in
her
yorkbury
hat
and
homemade
casaque
sit
down
sit
down
said
her
uncle
i
call
your
aunt
i
do
see
where
they
are
i
told
them
to
be
on
hand
kate
where
mrs
breynton
she
sir
dressing
said
the
servant
who
had
opened
the
door
tell
her
miss
gypsy
has
come
sit
down
child
and
make
yourself
at
home
gypsy
sat
down
and
breynton
not
satisfied
with
sending
a
message
to
his
wife
went
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
called
miranda
joy
a
voice
from
somewhere
above
answered
a
little
sharply
that
she
was
coming
as
fast
as
she
could
and
she
told
joyce
to
go
down
long
ago
but
she
had
stirred
gypsy
heard
every
word
and
she
began
to
wonder
if
her
aunt
were
very
glad
to
see
her
and
what
sort
of
a
girl
her
cousin
must
be
if
she
did
obey
her
mother
unless
she
chose
to
just
then
joy
came
down
stairs
walking
very
slowly
and
properly
and
came
into
the
parlor
with
the
manners
of
a
young
lady
of
eighteen
she
might
have
been
a
pretty
child
if
she
had
been
dressed
more
plainly
and
becomingly
but
her
face
was
pale
and
thin
and
there
was
a
fretful
look
about
her
mouth
that
almost
spoiled
it
gypsy
went
up
warmly
and
kissed
her
joy
had
extended
the
tips
of
her
fingers
to
shake
hands
and
she
looked
a
little
surprised
but
kissed
her
politely
and
asked
if
she
were
tired
with
the
journey
just
then
breynton
came
in
with
many
apologies
for
her
delay
met
gypsy
kindly
enough
and
sent
her
to
take
off
her
things
who
trimmed
your
hat
asked
joy
suddenly
miss
jones
she
our
milliner
oh
said
joy
mine
is
a
pheasant
nobody
thinks
of
wearing
velvet
now
most
everybody
has
a
pheasant
i
should
like
to
wear
just
what
everybody
else
did
gypsy
could
not
help
saying
she
hung
the
turban
up
in
the
closet
with
a
little
uncomfortable
feeling
it
was
a
fine
drab
straw
trimmed
and
bound
with
velvet
a
shade
darker
it
was
pretty
and
she
knew
it
it
just
matched
her
casaque
and
her
mother
had
thought
it
all
the
more
for
its
simplicity
nevertheless
it
was
not
going
to
be
very
pleasant
to
have
her
cousin
joy
ashamed
of
her
oh
oh
how
short
they
wear
dresses
in
yorkbury
remarked
joy
as
gypsy
walked
across
the
room
mine
are
nearly
to
the
tops
of
my
boots
now
thirteen
years
old
are
they
where
did
i
put
my
bag
said
gypsy
carelessly
joy
looked
a
little
piqued
that
she
did
not
seem
more
impressed
there
dinner
she
said
after
a
silence
in
which
she
had
been
secretly
inspecting
and
commenting
upon
every
article
of
gypsy
attire
come
let
go
down
mother
scolds
if
we
late
scolds
said
gypsy
how
funny
my
mother
never
scolds
does
she
asked
joy
a
little
wonder
in
her
eyes
it
seems
so
queer
to
have
dinner
at
six
said
gypsy
confidentially
as
they
went
down
stairs
at
home
they
are
just
sitting
down
to
supper
joy
laughed
patronizingly
oh
yes
i
suppose
you
used
to
country
hours
for
the
second
time
gypsy
felt
uncomfortable
she
would
very
much
have
liked
to
ask
her
cousin
what
there
was
to
be
ashamed
of
in
being
used
to
country
hours
when
you
lived
in
the
country
but
they
had
reached
the
door
and
her
aunt
was
calling
out
somewhat
fretfully
to
joy
to
hurry
so
she
said
nothing
after
supper
her
uncle
said
she
looked
very
much
like
her
father
hoped
she
would
make
herself
at
home
thought
her
a
little
taller
than
joyce
and
then
was
lost
to
view
for
the
evening
behind
his
newspaper
her
aunt
inquired
if
she
could
play
on
the
piano
was
surprised
to
find
she
knew
nothing
more
classical
than
chants
and
scotch
airs
told
joy
to
let
her
hear
that
last
air
of
von
weber
and
then
she
took
up
a
novel
which
was
lying
partially
read
upon
the
table
when
joy
was
through
playing
she
proposed
a
game
of
solitaire
gypsy
would
much
rather
have
examined
the
beautiful
and
costly
ornaments
with
which
the
rooms
were
filled
but
she
was
a
little
too
polite
and
a
little
too
proud
to
do
so
unasked
what
do
you
play
most
she
asked
as
they
began
to
move
the
figures
on
the
solitaire
board
oh
said
joy
i
practise
three
hours
and
that
takes
all
the
time
when
i
in
school
in
vacations
i
do
know
i
like
to
walk
in
commonwealth
avenue
pretty
well
then
mother
has
a
good
deal
of
company
and
i
always
come
down
only
go
to
walk
and
sit
still
in
the
parlor
exclaimed
gypsy
dear
me
why
what
do
you
do
me
oh
i
jump
on
the
hay
and
run
down
hills
and
poke
about
in
the
swamp
what
push
myself
round
on
a
raft
in
the
it
real
fun
why
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
said
joy
looking
shocked
well
it
splendid
you
ought
to
come
up
to
yorkbury
and
go
out
with
me
tom
would
make
you
a
raft
what
the
people
say
said
joy
looking
at
her
mother
oh
there
are
any
people
there
to
see
if
there
were
they
say
anything
i
have
just
the
nicest
times
winnie
and
i
tipped
over
last
spring
clear
over
splash
you
will
ruin
your
complexion
remarked
her
aunt
laying
down
her
novel
i
suppose
you
never
wear
a
veil
a
veil
dear
me
no
i
ca
bear
the
feeling
of
a
veil
i
wore
one
in
the
cars
through
to
keep
the
cinders
off
then
besides
that
i
row
and
coast
and
oh
i
forgot
walking
on
the
fences
it
real
fun
if
you
do
tumble
off
walking
on
the
fences
oh
yes
i
always
go
in
the
fields
where
there
nobody
round
then
i
like
to
climb
the
old
walls
where
you
have
to
jump
when
the
stones
roll
off
from
under
you
breynton
elevated
her
eyebrows
with
a
peculiar
expression
and
returned
to
her
novel
gypsy
was
one
of
those
happy
people
who
are
gifted
with
the
faculty
of
always
having
a
pleasant
time
and
the
solitaire
game
was
good
enough
if
it
had
been
so
quiet
but
when
she
went
up
to
bed
she
looked
somewhat
sober
she
bade
joy
shut
herself
into
the
room
which
had
been
given
her
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
winked
hard
several
times
she
would
not
have
objected
at
that
moment
to
seeing
her
mother
or
tom
or
pulling
her
father
whiskers
or
squeezing
winnie
a
little
or
looking
into
the
dear
familiar
where
they
were
all
gathered
just
then
to
have
prayers
she
began
to
have
a
vague
idea
that
there
was
no
place
like
home
she
also
came
to
the
conclusion
very
faintly
and
feeling
like
a
traitor
all
the
time
that
her
aunt
miranda
was
very
fashionable
and
very
fretful
and
did
not
treat
joy
at
all
as
her
mother
treated
her
that
joy
thought
her
countrified
and
had
never
walked
on
a
fence
in
all
her
life
that
her
uncle
was
very
good
but
very
busy
and
that
a
fortnight
was
a
rather
long
time
to
stay
there
however
her
uncle
house
was
not
the
whole
of
boston
all
the
delights
of
the
great
wonderful
city
remained
unexplored
and
who
could
tell
what
joys
would
bring
forth
so
gypsy
smiles
came
back
after
their
usual
punctual
fashion
and
she
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
her
head
touched
the
pillow
to
dream
that
she
was
sitting
in
tom
lap
reading
an
arabic
novel
aloud
to
winnie
it
might
have
been
about
half
an
hour
after
that
she
woke
suddenly
with
a
terrible
feeling
in
her
lungs
and
throat
and
sat
up
in
bed
gasping
to
see
the
door
burst
open
and
her
aunt
come
rushing
in
is
the
house
on
fire
asked
gypsy
sleepily
house
on
fire
it
might
have
been
it
a
wonder
you
alive
alive
repeated
gypsy
bewildered
why
child
you
blew
out
the
gas
said
her
aunt
sharply
throwing
open
the
windows
did
you
know
any
better
than
that
i
so
used
to
blowing
out
our
lamps
said
gypsy
feeling
very
much
frightened
and
ashamed
country
ways
exclaimed
her
aunt
well
thank
fortune
there
no
harm
done
go
to
sleep
like
a
good
girl
gypsy
did
not
relish
being
told
to
go
to
sleep
like
a
good
girl
when
she
had
done
nothing
wrong
nor
did
her
aunt
one
chilly
kiss
at
leaving
her
serve
to
make
her
forget
those
few
sharp
words
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
joy
proposed
to
go
out
to
walk
and
gypsy
ran
up
to
put
on
her
things
in
great
glee
one
little
circumstance
dashed
damply
on
it
like
water
on
glowing
coals
how
large
your
casaque
is
about
the
neck
said
joy
carelessly
i
like
mine
small
and
high
with
a
binding
gypsy
remembered
what
her
mother
said
and
because
her
casaque
happened
to
be
cut
after
miss
jones
patterns
instead
of
madame
demorest
she
did
not
feel
that
her
character
was
seriously
affected
but
it
was
not
pleasant
to
have
such
things
said
her
cousin
did
not
mean
to
be
unkind
on
the
contrary
she
had
taken
rather
a
fancy
to
gypsy
she
was
simply
a
little
thoughtless
and
a
little
vain
joy
is
not
the
only
girl
in
boston
i
am
afraid
who
has
hurt
the
feelings
of
her
country
visitors
in
that
careless
way
you
never
seen
the
common
i
suppose
nor
the
public
gardens
said
joy
as
they
started
off
we
walk
across
to
boylston
street
dear
me
you
have
any
gloves
on
oh
must
i
put
them
on
said
gypsy
with
a
sigh
i
afraid
i
like
boston
if
i
have
to
wear
gloves
i
ca
bear
the
feeling
of
them
i
suppose
that
what
makes
your
hands
so
red
and
brown
replied
joy
astonished
casting
a
glance
at
her
own
sickly
white
fingers
which
she
was
pinching
into
a
pair
of
very
tight
kid
gloves
here
are
the
gardens
she
said
proudly
as
they
entered
the
inclosure
are
they
beautiful
i
do
suppose
you
have
anything
like
this
in
yorkbury
we
go
up
to
the
common
in
a
minute
gypsy
looked
carelessly
around
and
did
not
seem
to
be
very
much
impressed
or
interested
i
rather
go
over
into
that
street
where
the
people
and
the
carriages
are
she
said
why
exclaimed
joy
do
you
like
it
see
the
fountains
and
the
deer
and
the
grass
and
all
i
like
the
deer
said
gypsy
only
i
feel
so
sorry
for
them
sorry
for
them
why
they
look
so
as
if
they
wanted
to
be
off
in
the
woods
with
nobody
round
i
like
the
rabbits
better
jumping
round
at
home
under
the
then
i
think
the
at
ripton
is
a
great
deal
prettier
than
these
fountains
but
then
i
guess
i
should
like
the
stores
she
said
apologetically
a
little
afraid
she
had
hurt
or
provoked
joy
i
never
saw
anybody
like
you
said
joy
looking
puzzled
when
they
came
to
tremont
and
then
to
washington
street
gypsy
was
in
an
ecstasy
she
kept
calling
to
joy
to
see
that
poor
little
beggar
girl
or
that
funny
old
woman
or
that
negro
boy
who
was
trying
to
stand
on
his
head
or
the
handsome
feather
on
that
lady
bonnet
and
stopped
every
other
minute
to
see
some
beautiful
toy
or
picture
in
a
till
joy
lost
all
patience
gypsy
breynton
do
keep
staring
in
the
windows
so
people
will
think
we
are
a
couple
of
servant
girls
just
from
down
east
who
never
saw
washington
street
before
i
never
did
said
gypsy
coolly
but
she
looked
a
little
sober
what
was
the
use
of
boston
and
all
its
beautiful
sights
and
busy
sounds
if
you
must
walk
right
along
as
if
you
were
going
to
church
and
not
seem
to
see
nor
hear
any
of
the
wonders
for
fear
of
being
called
countrified
gypsy
began
to
hate
the
word
you
must
take
your
cousin
to
the
aquarial
gardens
said
breynton
to
joy
at
dinner
oh
i
tired
to
death
of
the
aquarial
gardens
answered
joy
none
of
the
girls
i
go
with
ever
go
now
and
i
seen
it
all
so
many
times
but
gypsy
has
try
the
museum
then
i
ca
bear
the
museum
the
white
snakes
in
bottles
make
me
so
nervous
said
joy
a
white
snake
in
a
bottle
why
i
never
saw
one
said
gypsy
with
sparkling
eyes
well
i
go
with
you
child
if
joy
has
the
politeness
to
do
it
said
her
uncle
patting
her
eager
face
breynton
said
his
wife
petulantly
you
are
blaming
that
child
for
something
yet
in
the
very
next
breath
she
scolded
joy
for
delaying
her
practising
ten
minutes
more
severely
than
her
father
would
have
done
if
she
had
told
a
falsehood
breynton
was
very
busy
the
next
day
and
forgot
all
about
gypsy
but
the
day
after
he
left
his
store
at
an
early
hour
and
took
her
to
the
museum
and
out
to
bunker
hill
that
was
the
happiest
day
gypsy
spent
in
boston
the
day
after
her
aunt
had
a
large
dinner
company
no
one
would
have
imagined
that
gypsy
dreaded
it
in
the
least
but
in
her
secret
heart
she
did
joy
seemed
to
be
perfectly
happy
when
she
was
dressed
in
her
brilliant
stuart
plaid
silk
with
its
long
sash
and
valenciennes
lace
ruffles
and
spent
a
full
half
hour
exhibiting
her
to
wondering
eyes
and
trying
to
decide
whether
she
would
wear
her
coral
brooch
and
which
matched
the
scarlet
of
the
plaid
or
a
handsome
malachite
set
which
were
the
newer
gypsy
looked
on
admiringly
for
she
liked
pretty
things
as
well
as
other
girls
but
dressed
herself
in
the
simple
checked
foulard
with
blue
ribbons
around
her
net
and
at
her
throat
to
match
the
best
suit
over
which
her
mother
had
taken
so
much
pains
and
which
had
seemed
so
grand
in
yorkbury
hoped
her
aunt
guests
would
not
laugh
at
her
and
decided
to
think
no
more
about
the
matter
the
first
half
hour
of
dinner
passed
off
pleasantly
enough
gypsy
was
hungry
for
she
had
just
come
home
from
a
long
walk
to
williams
everett
picture
gallery
and
the
dinner
was
very
nice
the
only
trouble
with
it
being
that
there
were
so
many
courses
she
could
not
decide
what
to
eat
and
what
to
refuse
but
after
a
while
a
deaf
old
gentleman
who
sat
next
her
felt
conscientiously
impelled
to
ask
her
where
she
lived
and
how
old
she
was
and
she
had
to
scream
so
loud
to
answer
him
that
it
attracted
the
attention
of
all
the
guests
then
the
dessert
came
and
the
wine
and
an
hour
and
a
half
had
passed
and
still
no
one
showed
any
signs
of
leaving
the
table
and
the
old
gentleman
made
spasmodic
attempts
at
conversation
at
intervals
of
ten
minutes
the
hour
and
a
half
became
two
hours
and
gypsy
was
so
thoroughly
tired
out
sitting
still
it
seemed
as
if
she
should
scream
or
upset
her
or
knock
over
her
chair
or
do
some
terrible
thing
you
said
you
were
twelve
years
old
i
believe
said
the
old
gentleman
suddenly
this
was
the
fifth
time
he
had
asked
that
very
same
question
joy
trod
on
gypsy
toes
under
the
table
and
gypsy
laughed
coughed
seized
her
goblet
and
began
to
drink
violently
to
conceal
her
rudeness
twelve
years
and
you
live
in
vermont
remarked
the
old
gentleman
placidly
this
was
a
drop
too
much
gypsy
swallowed
her
water
the
wrong
way
strangled
and
choked
and
ran
out
of
the
room
with
crimson
face
mortified
and
gasping
she
knew
by
a
little
flash
of
her
aunt
eyes
that
she
was
ashamed
of
her
and
much
displeased
she
locked
herself
into
her
own
room
feeling
very
miserable
and
would
not
have
gone
down
stairs
again
if
she
had
not
been
sent
for
after
the
company
had
returned
to
the
parlors
she
did
not
dare
to
disobey
so
she
went
and
sat
down
in
a
corner
by
the
piano
where
she
hoped
she
should
be
out
of
sight
a
lady
sitting
near
turned
and
said
do
you
play
my
dear
a
little
said
gypsy
wishing
she
could
have
truthfully
said
no
i
wish
you
would
play
for
me
said
the
lady
oh
i
should
like
to
said
gypsy
shrinking
i
do
know
anything
but
scotch
airs
that
is
just
what
i
like
said
the
lady
breynton
ca
you
persuade
your
niece
to
play
a
little
for
me
certainly
gypsy
said
her
aunt
with
a
look
which
plainly
said
think
of
it
gypsy
mother
had
taught
her
that
it
was
both
disobliging
and
affected
to
refuse
to
play
when
she
was
asked
no
matter
how
simple
her
music
might
be
so
not
knowing
how
to
refuse
and
wishing
the
floor
would
open
and
swallow
her
up
she
went
to
the
piano
and
played
two
sweet
scotch
airs
she
played
them
well
for
a
girl
of
her
age
and
the
lady
thanked
her
and
seemed
to
enjoy
them
but
that
night
just
as
she
was
going
to
bed
she
accidentally
overheard
her
aunt
saying
to
joy
it
was
very
stupid
and
forward
in
her
i
tried
to
make
her
understand
but
i
could
those
little
songs
too
why
with
all
your
practice
and
such
teachers
as
you
have
had
i
would
think
of
letting
you
play
before
anybody
at
your
age
gypsy
cried
herself
to
sleep
that
night
just
a
week
from
the
day
that
she
came
to
boston
gypsy
and
joy
were
out
shopping
in
summer
street
they
had
just
come
out
of
hovey
when
they
met
a
ragged
child
not
more
than
three
years
old
crying
as
if
its
heart
were
broken
oh
dear
cried
gypsy

that
poor
little
girl
i

to
see

joy
horrified

along
nobody
stops
to
speak
to
beggars
in
boston
what
you
doing
for
gypsy
had
stopped
and
taken
the
child
two
dirty
little
fists
down
from
her
eyes
and
looked
down
into
the
and
face
to
see
what
was
the
matter
i
i
do
know
where
nobody
is
sobbed
the
child
have
you
lost
your
way
where
do
you
live
asked
gypsy
with
great
pitying
eyes
gypsy
could
never
bear
to
see
anybody
cry
and
then
the
little
creature
was
so
ragged
and
thin
i
live
there
said
the
child
pointing
vaguely
down
the
street
mother
to
home
there
somewhars
i
go
with
you
and
find
your
mother
said
gypsy
and
taking
the
child
hand
she
started
off
in
her
usual
impulsive
fashion
without
a
thought
beyond
her
pity
gypsy
gypsy
breynton
called
joy
the
police
will
take
her
home
you
must
but
gypsy
did
not
hear
and
joy
shocked
and
indignant
went
home
and
left
her
in
about
an
hour
gypsy
came
back
flushed
and
panting
with
her
haste
joy
in
speechless
amazement
had
looked
from
the
window
and
seen
her
across
the
common
her
aunt
met
her
on
the
stairs
with
a
face
like
a
why
gypsy
breynton
i
am
ashamed
of
you
how
you
do
such
a
thing
as
to
go
off
with
a
beggar
and
hold
of
her
right
there
in
summer
street
and
go
nobody
knows
where
alone
into
those
terrible
irish
streets
it
was
a
thing
to
do
and
i
should
think
you
would
have
known
better
and
i
really
think
i
must
write
to
your
mother
about
it
immediately
gypsy
stood
for
a
moment
motionless
with
astonishment
then
without
saying
a
word
she
passed
her
aunt
quickly
on
the
stairs
and
ran
up
to
her
room
her
face
was
very
white
if
she
had
been
at
home
she
would
have
broken
forth
in
a
torrent
of
angry
words
kate
the
was
sweeping
the
entry
did
you
know
there
was
going
to
be
another
great
dinner
miss
she
said
as
gypsy
passed
her
gypsy
went
into
her
room
and
locked
her
door
another
of
those
terrible
and
her
aunt
so
angry
at
her
it
was
too
much
she
could
not
bear
it
she
looked
about
the
room
twice
passed
her
hand
over
her
forehead
and
her
face
flushed
quickly
one
of
gypsy
sudden
and
often
perilous
resolutions
was
made
chapter
xii
no
place
like
home
no
one
came
to
the
room
after
a
while
the
front
door
opened
and
shut
and
she
saw
from
the
window
that
her
aunt
and
joy
were
going
out
she
then
remembered
that
she
had
heard
them
say
they
had
some
calls
to
make
at
that
hour
her
uncle
was
at
the
store
and
no
one
was
now
in
the
house
besides
herself
but
the
servants
all
right
she
said
half
aloud
i
could
have
fixed
it
better
for
half
an
hour
she
stayed
in
her
room
with
the
door
locked
and
any
one
listening
outside
could
have
heard
her
moving
briskly
about
opening
drawers
and
shutting
closet
doors
then
she
came
down
stairs
and
went
out
she
was
gone
just
about
long
enough
to
have
been
to
the
nearest
and
back
again
a
few
minutes
after
she
returned
the
rang
i
go
she
called
to
kate
it
a
man
i
sent
here
on
an
errand
and
i
shall
have
to
see
him
very
well
miss
said
kate
and
went
singing
down
the
with
her
broom
this
way
said
gypsy
opening
the
door
she
led
the
way
to
her
room
and
the
man
who
followed
her
shouldered
her
trunk
with
one
hand
and
carried
it
out
to
a
carriage
which
stood
at
the
door
gypsy
went
into
her
room
and
left
a
little
note
on
the
table
where
it
would
be
easily
seen
threw
her
veil
over
her
face
felt
of
her
purse
to
be
sure
it
was
safe
in
her
pocket
and
ran
hastily
down
stairs
after
him
and
into
the
carriage
the
man
strapped
on
her
trunk
slammed
the
door
upon
her
and
mounting
his
box
drove
rapidly
away
kate
who
happened
to
be
looking
out
of
one
of
the
basement
windows
saw
the
carriage
but
did
not
notice
the
trunk
she
supposed
gypsy
was
riding
somewhere
to
meet
her
aunt
or
uncle
and
went
on
with
her
dusting
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
fitchburg
depot
and
gypsy
paid
her
fare
and
went
into
the
ladies
room
the
coachman
who
seemed
to
be
an
accommodating
man
though
a
little
curious
brought
her
a
check
and
hoped
she
get
along
comfortable
it
was
a
pretty
long
journey
for
such
a
young
creetur
to
take
alone
gypsy
thanked
him
and
going
up
to
the
asked
him
something
in
a
low
tone
in
just
an
hour
said
the
in
a
loud
voice
hour
so
long
as
that
yes
gypsy
drew
her
veil
very
closely
about
her
face
and
sat
down
in
the
darkest
corner
she
could
find
she
seemed
to
be
very
much
afraid
of
being
recognized
for
she
shrank
from
every
and
started
every
time
the
door
opened
train
for
fitchburg
rutland
burlington
shouted
a
voice
at
last
and
the
words
were
drowned
in
the
noise
of
hurrying
feet
gypsy
took
a
seat
in
the
rear
car
by
the
door
which
was
open
so
that
she
was
partially
concealed
from
the
view
of
the
passengers
just
before
the
train
started
a
tall
whiskered
gentleman
walked
slowly
through
the
car
scanning
the
faces
on
each
side
of
him
you
have
seen
a
little
girl
here
dressed
in
drab
with
black
eyes
and
red
cheeks
have
you
he
asked
stopping
just
in
front
of
gypsy
several
of
the
passengers
shook
their
heads
and
one
old
lady
piped
out
on
a
very
high
key
no
sir
i
hai
the
gentleman
passed
out
and
shut
the
door
gypsy
held
her
breath
it
was
her
uncle
he
looked
troubled
and
anxious
gypsy
cheeks
flushed
a
sudden
impulse
came
over
her
to
call
him
back
she
started
and
threw
open
the
window
but
the
rang
the
train
puffed
slowly
off
and
her
uncle
disappeared
in
the
crowd
as
she
was
whirled
rapidly
along
through
wharves
and
shipping
and
lumber
away
from
the
roar
of
the
city
and
out
where
woods
and
green
fields
lined
the
way
she
began
for
the
first
time
to
think
what
she
was
doing
and
to
wonder
if
she
were
doing
right
her
anger
at
her
aunt
and
the
utter
disappointment
and
homesickness
of
her
boston
visit
had
swept
away
for
a
few
moments
all
her
power
of
reasoning
to
get
home
to
see
her
mother
to
hide
her
head
on
her
shoulder
and
cry
this
was
the
one
thought
that
had
turned
itself
over
and
over
in
her
mind
on
that
quick
ride
from
beacon
street
and
in
that
hour
spent
in
the
dark
corner
of
the
depot
here
she
was
running
like
a
thief
from
her
uncle
house
without
a
word
of
or
thanks
for
his
hospitality
with
no
message
to
tell
him
where
she
had
gone
but
that
note
hastily
written
in
the
first
flush
of
her
hurt
and
angry
feelings
and
the
hurrying
train
was
whirling
her
over
hill
and
valley
faster
and
farther
to
go
back
was
impossible
go
on
she
must
what
had
she
done
she
began
now
too
to
wonder
where
she
should
spend
the
night
the
train
went
only
as
far
as
rutland
and
it
would
be
late
and
dark
when
she
reached
the
town
far
too
late
for
a
little
girl
to
be
travelling
alone
and
to
spend
a
night
in
a
strange
hotel
in
a
strange
place
what
should
she
do
as
the
afternoon
passed
and
the
twilight
fell
and
the
lamps
were
lighted
and
people
hurried
out
at
to
safe
and
waiting
homes
her
loneliness
and
anxiety
increased
just
before
entering
rutland
a
young
man
dressed
in
a
dandyish
manner
and
partially
intoxicated
entered
the
car
and
took
the
empty
seat
by
gypsy
she
did
not
like
his
looks
and
moved
away
slightly
turning
to
look
out
of
the
window
no
offense
i
hope
said
the
man
with
a
foolish
smile
the
car
was
full
gypsy
made
no
reply
travelling
far
he
said
a
moment
after
to
rutland
sir
said
gypsy
feeling
very
uneasy
as
she
perceived
the
odor
of
rum
and
wishing
he
would
not
talk
to
her
friends
there
said
the
man
again
n
no
sir
said
gypsy
reluctantly
i
am
going
to
the
hotel
stranger
in
town
what
hotel
do
you
go
to
i
do
know
said
gypsy
hurriedly
the
car
was
just
stopping
and
she
rose
and
tried
to
pass
him
i
will
show
you
the
way
he
said
standing
up
and
reeling
slightly
as
he
tried
to
walk
gypsy
in
despair
looked
for
the
conductor
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
crowd
passed
out
quite
careless
of
the
frightened
child
or
regarding
her
only
with
a
curious
stare
it
only
a
little
way
said
the
man
with
an
oath
why
sakes
a
massy
if
this
ai
gypsy
breynton
gypsy
turned
with
a
cry
of
joy
at
hearing
her
name
and
fairly
sprang
into
surly
arms
why
where
on
airth
did
you
come
from
gypsy
breynton
i
came
from
boston
and
that
man
is
drunk
and
oh
dear
i
so
glad
to
see
you
and
i
got
to
go
to
a
hotel
and
i
did
know
what
mother
would
say
and
where
did
you
come
from
said
gypsy
talking
very
fast
i
come
from
my
sister
lucindy
down
to
bellows
falls
and
i
going
to
cousin
mary
ann
jacobs
to
spend
the
night
oh
said
gypsy
wistfully
i
do
see
how
a
little
gal
like
you
ever
come
to
be
on
a
night
train
alone
said
surly
with
a
keen
curious
look
at
gypsy
face
but
i
know
your
ma
never
let
you
go
to
a
hotel
this
time
o
night
and
mary
ann
she
be
delighted
to
see
you
so
you
better
come
along
gypsy
was
so
happy
and
so
thankful
she
could
fairly
have
kissed
her
even
her
surly
cousin
mary
ann
received
her
hospitably
and
the
evening
and
the
night
passed
quickly
away
surly
was
very
curious
and
somewhat
suspicious
on
the
subject
of
gypsy
return
to
yorkbury
under
such
peculiar
circumstances
gypsy
said
that
she
left
boston
quite
suddenly
that
they
were
not
expecting
her
at
home
and
that
she
took
so
late
a
train
for
several
reasons
but
had
not
thought
that
it
went
no
further
than
rutland
till
she
was
fairly
started
which
was
true
more
than
this
surly
could
not
out
of
her
and
she
soon
gave
up
trying
cousin
mary
ann
wanted
surly
company
another
day
so
gypsy
took
an
early
train
for
yorkbury
alone
gypsy
never
took
any
trouble
very
deeply
to
heart
and
the
morning
sunlight
and
the
sight
of
the
dear
familiar
mountains
drove
away
to
a
great
extent
the
repentant
and
anxious
thoughts
of
the
night
as
the
train
shrieked
into
yorkbury
she
forgot
everything
but
that
she
was
at
home
miles
away
from
boston
her
mother
near
and
tom
and
the
dear
old
days
of
paddling
about
on
rafts
and
having
no
to
disgrace
herself
at
and
no
aunt
to
be
afraid
of
it
seemed
as
if
every
one
she
knew
were
at
the
station
surly
was
there
under
strict
orders
from
his
wife
to
watch
for
her
every
train
till
she
came
and
fisher
was
there
just
down
on
an
errand
from
the
mountains
and
rowe
and
sarah
were
walking
up
the
street
and
agnes
gaylord
was
over
at
the
grocer
nodding
and
smiling
as
gypsy
stepped
upon
the
platform
and
there
too
was
simms
who
had
been
somewhere
in
the
cars
and
who
stepped
into
the
coach
just
after
she
did
why
miss
gypsy
why
really
you
home
again
my
dear
why
your
father
did
expect
you
i
know
it
said
gypsy
are
they
all
well
oh
yes
yes
all
well
but
to
give
them
such
a
surprise
it
is
so
exactly
like
you
my
dear
i
do
like
boston
said
gypsy
coloring
i
had
a
horrid
time
and
i
came
home
very
suddenly
do
like
boston
well
you
a
remarkable
young
lady
exclaimed
simms
and
relapsed
into
silence
watching
gypsy
flushed
and
eager
face
as
people
watch
a
light
coming
back
into
a
dark
room
we
have
missed
you
up
at
the
store
my
dear
he
said
after
a
while
have
you
i
glad
oh
who
that
with
miss
melville
out
walking
under
the
i
guess
it
mr
hallam
oh
to
be
sure
interrupted
gypsy
looking
very
bright
i
see
mr
guy
hallam
now
i
guess
i
know
why
she
would
teach
school
they
are
to
be
married
in
the
spring
said
simms
just
think
said
gypsy
how
funny
now
she
have
to
stay
at
home
and
keep
house
all
day
i
think
she
real
silly
do
you
of
all
the
many
remarkable
things
that
miss
gypsy
had
ever
said
simms
thought
this
capped
the
climax
now
the
coach
had
rattled
up
the
hill
and
lumbered
round
the
corner
and
there
was
the
old
house
looking
quiet
and
pleasant
and
dear
in
the
morning
sunlight
gypsy
was
so
excited
that
she
could
not
sit
still
and
kept
simms
in
a
fever
of
anxiety
for
fear
she
would
tumble
out
of
the
coach
windows
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
had
been
gone
a
year
instead
of
just
one
week
she
sprang
down
the
at
a
bound
and
ran
into
the
house
her
mother
was
out
in
the
kitchen
helping
patty
about
the
dinner
she
heard
such
a
singing
and
shouting
as
no
one
had
made
in
the
house
since
gypsy
went
away
and
hurried
out
into
the
front
entry
to
see
what
had
happened
tom
ran
in
from
the
garden
and
winnie
slid
down
on
the
banisters
and
breynton
was
just
coming
up
the
yard
and
patty
put
her
head
in
at
the
entry
door
wiping
her
hands
on
her
apron
and
everybody
must
be
kissed
all
round
and
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
such
a
bustle
that
gypsy
could
hardly
hear
herself
speak
what
has
brought
you
home
so
soon
asked
her
mother
then
we
look
for
you
for
a
week
yet
oh
i
hate
boston
cried
gypsy
pulling
off
her
things
i
did
like
anything
but
the
museum
and
bunker
hill
and
joy
wore
silk
dresses
and
would
let
me
look
in
the
i
took
a
poor
little
home
and
you
ca
run
round
any
and
aunt
miranda
told
me
she
tell
you
and
i
hate
it
and
she
just
as
cross
as
a
bear
your
aunt
cross
said
her
mother
who
could
make
neither
beginning
nor
end
of
gypsy
excited
story
i
guess
she
is
said
gypsy
with
an
emphasis
oh
i
so
glad
to
get
home
where
the
kitty
and
how
peace
maythorne
and
everybody
and
winnie
has
a
new
jacket
has
he
and
breynton
exchanged
glances
they
saw
that
something
was
wrong
but
wisely
considered
that
that
time
was
not
the
one
for
making
any
inquiries
into
the
matter
breynton
thought
also
that
if
gypsy
had
been
guilty
of
or
rudeness
she
would
confess
it
herself
she
was
right
for
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
gypsy
called
her
away
alone
and
told
her
all
the
story
they
were
shut
up
together
a
long
time
and
when
gypsy
came
out
her
eyes
were
red
with
crying
all
that

said
does
not
matter
here
but
gypsy
is
not
likely
soon
to
forget
it
a
few
words
spoken
just
as
the
conversation
ended
became
golden
mottoes
that
helped
her
over
many
rough
places
in
her
life
it
is
all
the
old
trouble
gypsy
you
think
a
little
a
moment
quiet
thought
would
have
saved
all
this
oh
i
know
it
sobbed
gypsy
that
what
always
ails
me
i
always
doing
things
and
always
sorry
for
them
i
mean
to
do
right
and
i
can
not
remember
what
shall
i
do
with
myself
mother
gypsy
said
her
mother
very
soberly
this
will
never
do
you
think
and
gypsy
my
child
in
every
one
of
these
little
thoughtless
words
and
acts
god
sees
a
a
sin
when
you
did
think
exclaimed
gypsy
you
must
learn
to
think
gypsy
and
he
will
teach
you
her
mother
kissed
her
many
times
and
gypsy
clung
to
her
neck
and
was
very
still
whatever
thoughts
she
had
just
then
she
never
told
them
to
any
one
the
afternoon
passed
away
like
a
merry
dream
gypsy
was
so
happy
that
she
had
had
the
talk
with
her
mother
so
glad
to
be
kissed
and
forgiven
and
loved
and
helped
to
find
every
one
so
pleased
to
see
her
back
and
home
so
dear
and
the
mountains
so
blue
and
beautiful
and
the
sunlight
so
bright
that
she
scarcely
knew
whether
she
were
asleep
or
awake
she
must
hunt
up
the
kitten
and
feed
the
chickens
and
take
a
peep
at
the
cow
and
stroke
old
billy
in
his
stall
she
must
see
how
many
sweet
peas
were
left
on
the
vines
and
climb
out
on
the
that
had
been
freshly
shingled
since
she
was
gone
and
run
down
to
the
kleiner
berg
and
over
to
see
sarah
rowe
she
must
know
just
what
tom
had
been
doing
this
interminable
week
just
how
many
buttons
winnie
had
lost
off
from
his
jacket
and
what
kind
of
pies
patty
had
baked
for
dinner
she
must
kiss
her
mother
twenty
times
an
hour
and
pull
her
father
whiskers
and
ride
winnie
on
her
shoulder
best
of
all
perhaps
it
was
to
run
down
to
peace
maythorne
and
find
the
sunlight
golden
in
the
quiet
room
and
the
pale
face
smiling
on
the
pillow
to
hear
the
gentle
voice
when
the
door
opened
say
oh
gypsy
in
such
a
way
as
no
other
voice
ever
said
it
and
then
to
sit
down
and
lay
her
head
upon
the
pillow
by
peace
and
tell
her
all
that
had
happened
well
said
peace
smiling
i
think
you
have
learned
a
good
deal
for
one
week
and
i
guess
you
will
never
it
i
guess
you
be
very
sorry
you
went
to
bosting
remarked
winnie
in
an
oracular
manner
that
night
when
they
were
all
together
in
their
old
places
in
the
the
meddlesome
quinine
club
had
a
concert
here
last
wednesday
and
we
had
preserved
seats
what
do
you
think
of
that
this
is
a
copy
of
the
letter
that
found
its
way
to
beacon
street
a
few
days
after
my
dear
uncle
and
aunt
miranda
i
am
so
sorry
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
was
so
tired
sitting
still
and
going
to
and
then
auntie
was
displeased
about
the
i
took
her
home
and
her
mother
was
just
as
glad
as
she
could
be
and
so
poor
and
so
i
felt
angry
and
homesick
and
i
know
i
to
have
gone
to
such
a
place
without
asking
but
i
did
think
and
then
i
came
home
in
the
afternoon
train
but
i
did
think
when
i
did
that
either
mother
says
that
was
no
excuse
and
i
know
it
was
very
wicked
in
me
to
do
such
a
thing
surly
met
me
in
the
cars
at
rutland
and
took
me
to
spend
the
night
with
her
cousin
mary
ann
jacobs
so
i
got
along
safely
and
nothing
happened
to
me
but
one
drunken
man
that
kept
talking
mother
says
i
have
done
a
rude
and
unkind
thing
to
leave
you
all
so
when
you
had
invited
me
there
and
been
so
good
to
me
i
know
it
i
had
a
real
nice
time
when
i
went
to
see
bunker
hill
and
the
museum
with
uncle
and
of
course
it
was
my
own
fault
that
i
did
like
to
wear
gloves
and
choked
so
at
dinner
mother
says
you
will
never
want
to
see
me
there
again
and
i
think
you
would
seems
to
me
i
never
did
such
a
thing
in
all
my
life
and
you
have
any
idea
how
badly
i
feel
about
it
but
i
know
that
help
it
any
i
made
up
my
mind
never
to
do
anything
again
till
i
thought
it
all
over
as
many
as
twelve
times
mother
says
two
or
three
would
do
but
i
think
twelve
would
be
safer
i
wish
you
let
joy
come
up
here
i
take
her
boating
and
riding
and
up
to
ripton
and
down
to
the
swamp
and
everything
and
try
to
make
up
i
do
suppose
you
will
ever
care
anything
more
about
me
but
i
wish
you
please
to
excuse
me
and
forgive
me
your
affectionate
niece
gypsy

little

they

and
