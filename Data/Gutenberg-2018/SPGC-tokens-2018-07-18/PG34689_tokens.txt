chapter
old
at
her
desk
in
the
assembly
room
of
riverview
high
school
penny
parker
sat
poised
for
instant
flight
her
books
had
been
stacked
away
and
she
awaited
only
the
closing
bell
to
liberate
her
from
a
day
of
study
now
do
forget
she
whispered
to
her
chum
louise
sidell
who
occupied
the
desk
directly
behind
we
start
for
the
old
marborough
place
right
away
the
dismissal
bell
tapped
penny
bolted
down
the
aisle
and
was
one
of
the
first
to
reach
the
door
however
hearing
her
name
called
she
was
forced
to
pause
penelope
will
you
wait
a
moment
please
requested
the
teacher
in
charge
of
assembly
yes
miss
nelson
penny
dutifully
responded
but
she
shot
her
chum
a
glance
of
black
despair
what
have
you
done
now
louise
demanded
in
an
accusing
whisper
not
a
thing
muttered
penny
about
ten
minutes
ago
i
clipped
fred
green
with
a
paper
ball
but
i
do
think
she
saw
me
get
out
of
it
as
fast
as
you
can
louise
urged
unless
we
start
for
the
marborough
place
within
half
an
hour
we
have
to
postpone
the
trip
while
the
other
pupils
filed
slowly
from
the
room
penny
slumped
back
into
her
seat
she
was
a
tall
slim
girl
with
mischievous
blue
eyes
which
hinted
of
an
active
mind
golden
hair
was
accented
by
a
brown
sweater
caught
at
the
throat
with
a
conspicuous
ornament
a
weird
looking
animal
made
of
leather
penelope
i
do
suppose
you
know
why
i
asked
you
to
remain
observed
the
teacher
slowly
coming
down
the
aisle
why
no
miss
nelson
penny
was
far
too
wise
to
make
damaging
admissions
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
rhoda
wiegand
about
rhoda
penny
echoed
genuinely
surprised
the
girl
was
a
new
student
at
riverview
somewhat
older
than
the
members
of
her
class
and
lived
in
a
trailer
camp
at
the
outskirts
of
the
city
miss
nelson
seated
herself
at
a
desk
opposite
penny
thus
indicating
that
she
meant
the
talk
to
be
friendly
and
informal
penelope
she
resumed
you
are
president
of
the
palette
club
why
has
rhoda
never
been
taken
in
as
a
member
she
is
one
of
our
most
talented
art
students
some
of
the
girls
do
seem
to
like
rhoda
very
well
penny
answered
squirming
uncomfortably
we
did
talk
about
taking
her
into
the
club
but
nothing
came
of
it
as
president
of
the
organization
could
you
arrange
it
i
suppose
so
penny
admitted
frowning
thoughtfully
why
do
the
girls
dislike
rhoda
there
does
seem
to
be
any
special
reason
for
it
her
poverty
perhaps
i
do
think
it
that
penny
defended
the
club
members
rhoda
is
so
quiet
that
the
girls
have
never
become
acquainted
with
her
then
i
suggest
that
they
make
an
immediate
effort
miss
nelson
ended
the
interview
the
palette
club
has
no
right
to
an
existence
unless
it
welcomes
members
with
real
art
talent
a
group
of
girls
awaited
penny
when
she
reached
the
locker
room
they
eagerly
plied
her
with
questions
as
to
why
she
had
been
detained
by
the
teacher
i
tell
you
later
penny
promised
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
rhoda
wiegand
was
removing
a
coat
from
her
locker
a
girl
of
seventeen
she
wore
a
faded
blue
dress
which
seemed
to
draw
all
color
from
her
thin
face
knowing
that
she
was
not
well
liked
she
seldom
spoke
or
forced
herself
upon
the
other
students
rhoda
began
penny
paying
no
heed
to
the
amazed
glances
of
her
friends
the
palette
club
is
having
a
meeting
this
afternoon
at
the
old
marborough
place
why
not
come
with
us
the
older
girl
turned
quickly
a
smile
of
surprise
and
pleasure
brightening
her
face
oh
i
should
love
to
go
only
i
do
think
hesitating
she
gazed
at
the
other
girls
who
were
eyeing
her
in
a
none
too
friendly
way
penny
gave
louise
sidell
a
little
pinch
her
chum
understanding
what
was
expected
said
with
as
much
warmth
as
she
could
yes
do
come
rhoda
we
plan
to
sketch
the
old
wishing
well
i
have
enough
drawing
material
for
both
of
us
penny
added
persuasively
if
you
really
want
me
of
course
i
come
rhoda
accepted
her
voice
rather
tremulous
i
heard
about
the
marborough
homestead
and
always
longed
to
see
it
a
group
of
subdued
girls
gathered
their
belongings
from
the
lockers
preparing
to
leave
the
school
grounds
no
one
understood
why
penny
had
invited
rhoda
to
attend
the
outing
and
the
act
had
not
been
a
popular
one
boarding
a
bus
the
twelve
members
of
the
palette
club
soon
reached
the
end
of
the
line
and
from
there
walked
a
quarter
of
a
mile
into
the
country
penny
and
louise
chose
rhoda
as
their
companion
trying
to
make
her
feel
at
ease
conversation
became
rather
difficult
and
they
were
relieved
when
at
length
they
approached
their
destination
there
the
old
house
penny
said
indicating
a
steep
pitched
which
could
be
seen
rising
above
a
jungle
of
tall
oaks
it
been
unoccupied
for
at
least
ten
years
now
the
marborough
homestead
a
handsome
dwelling
of
war
day
long
had
been
riverview
most
outstanding
architectural
curiosity
only
in
a
vague
way
was
penny
familiar
with
its
history
the
property
had
been
named
rose
acres
and
its
mistress
james
marborough
had
moved
from
the
city
many
years
before
allowing
the
house
to
stand
unpainted
and
untended
once
so
beautifully
kept
the
grounds
had
become
a
tangle
of
weeds
and
untrimmed
bushes
even
so
the
old
plantation
home
with
its
six
graceful
pillars
retained
dignity
and
beauty
entering
the
yard
through
a
space
where
a
gate
once
had
stood
the
girls
gazed
about
with
interest
framed
in
a
clump
of
giant
azaleas
was
the
statue
of
an
indian
girl
with
stone
feathers
in
her
hair
beyond
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
river
which
curved
around
the
south
side
of
the
grounds
in
a
wide
bend
where
is
the
old
wishing
well
rhoda
inquired
i
heard
so
much
about
it
we
coming
to
it
now
penny
replied
leading
the
way
down
an
avenue
of
oak
trees
not
far
from
the
house
stood
the
covered
well
its
base
was
of
cut
stone
and
on
a
bronze
plate
had
been
engraved
the
words
you
do
a
good
deed
you
can
make
a
wish
and
it
will
come
some
people
around
riverview
really
believe
that
this
old
well
has
the
power
to
make
wishes
come
true
louise
sidell
remarked
peering
at
her
reflection
mirrored
in
the
water
far
below
in
the
past
years
when
marborough
lived
here
it
had
quite
a
reputation
the
water
is
still
good
if
you
do
mind
a
few
germs
penny
added
with
a
laugh
i
see
that
someone
has
replaced
the
bucket
there
was
none
here
the
last
time
i
came
by
means
of
the
long
sweep
she
lowered
the
receptacle
and
brought
it
up
filled
with
water
make
a
wish
penny
one
of
her
friends
urged
maybe
it
will
come
true
everyone
knows
what
she
ask
for
teased
louise
her
desires
are
always
the
same
a
bigger
weekly
allowance
penny
smiled
as
she
drew
a
dipper
of
water
from
the
wooden
bucket
how
about
the
good
deed
she
inquired
lightly
i
done
nothing
worthy
of
a
demand
upon
this
old
well
you
helped
your
father
round
up
a
group
of
night
riders
louise
reminded
her
remember
the
big
story
you
wrote
for
the
which
was
titled
clock
strikes
i
did
prevent
clyde
blake
from
tricking
a
number
of
people
in
this
community
penny
acknowledged
perhaps
that
entitles
me
to
a
wish
drinking
deeply
from
the
dipper
she
poured
the
last
drops
into
the
well
watching
as
they
made
concentric
circles
in
the
still
water
below
old
well
do
your
stuff
and
grant
my
wish
she
entreated
please
get
busy
right
away
but
what
is
your
wish
penny
demanded
one
of
the
girls
you
have
to
tell
all
right
i
wish
that
this
old
marborough
property
could
be
restored
to
its
former
beauty
you
believe
in
making
hard
ones
louise
laughed
i
doubt
that
this
place
ever
will
be
fixed
up
again
at
least
not
until
after
the
property
changes
hands
it
rhoda
turn
now
penny
said
offering
the
dipper
to
her
the
older
girl
stepped
to
the
edge
of
the
well
her
face
very
serious
do
you
think
wishes
really
do
come
true
she
asked
thoughtfully
oh
it
only
for
the
fun
of
it
louise
responded
but
they
do
say
that
in
the
old
days
this
well
had
remarkable
powers
at
least
many
persons
came
here
to
make
wishes
which
they
claimed
came
true
i
believe
in
it
myself
rhoda
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
down
into
the
well
drinking
from
the
dipper
she
allowed
a
few
drops
to
spatter
into
the
deep
cavern
below
i
wish
she
said
in
a
low
tense
voice
i
wish
that
some
day
pop
and
breen
will
be
repaid
for
looking
after
my
brother
and
me
i
wish
that
they
may
have
more
money
for
food
and
clothes
and
a
few
really
nice
things
an
awkward
embarrassing
silence
descended
upon
the
group
of
girls
everyone
knew
that
rhoda
and
her
younger
brother
ted
lived
at
a
trailer
camp
with
a
family
unrelated
to
them
but
not
even
penny
had
troubled
to
learn
additional
details
from
rhoda
wish
it
was
apparent
to
all
that
the
breens
were
in
dire
poverty
it
your
turn
now
louise
penny
said
quickly
louise
accepted
the
dipper
without
drinking
she
tossed
all
the
water
into
the
well
saying
gaily
i
wish
penny
would
grow
long
ears
and
a
tail
it
would
serve
her
right
for
solving
so
many
mystery
cases
the
other
girls
made
equally
frivolous
wishes
thereafter
they
abandoned
fun
for
serious
work
getting
out
their
sketching
materials
penny
and
louise
began
to
draw
the
old
well
but
rhoda
intrigued
by
the
classical
beauty
of
the
house
decided
to
try
to
transfer
it
to
paper
you
do
nice
work
penny
praised
gazing
over
the
older
girl
shoulder
the
rest
of
us
ca
begin
to
match
it
you
may
have
the
sketch
when
i
finish
rhoda
offered
as
she
spoke
the
girls
were
startled
to
hear
a
commotion
in
the
bushes
behind
the
house
chickens
began
to
cackle
and
to
their
ears
came
the
sound
of
pounding
feet
suddenly
from
the
direction
of
the
river
a
young
man
darted
into
view
pursued
by
an
elderly
man
who
was
less
agile
to
the
girls
it
was
immediately
apparent
why
the
youth
was
being
chased
for
he
carried
a
fat
hen
beneath
his
arm
and
ran
with
hat
pulled
low
over
his
face
a
chicken
thief
penny
exclaimed
springing
to
her
feet
come
on
girls
let
head
him
off
chapter
the
covered
seeing
the
group
of
girls
by
the
wishing
well
the
youth
swerved
and
fled
in
the
opposite
direction
darting
into
the
woods
he
ran
so
swiftly
that
penny
realized
pursuit
would
be
futile
who
was
he
she
questioned
the
others
did
any
of
you
recognize
him
i
sure
i
seen
him
somewhere
louise
sidell
declared
were
you
able
to
see
his
face
rhoda
the
older
girl
did
not
answer
for
at
that
moment
the
man
who
had
pursued
the
boy
ran
into
the
yard
breathing
hard
he
paused
near
the
well
did
you
see
a
boy
come
through
here
he
asked
abruptly
the
rascal
stole
one
of
my
good
layin
hens
we
saw
him
penny
answered
but
i
sure
you
never
overtake
him
now
he
ran
into
the
woods
reckon
you
right
the
man
muttered
seating
himself
on
the
stone
rim
of
the
wishing
well
i
tuckered
taking
out
a
handkerchief
he
wiped
perspiration
from
his
forehead
penny
thought
that
she
recognized
the
man
as
a
stonecutter
who
lived
in
a
shack
at
the
river
edge
he
was
a
short
muscular
individual
strong
despite
his
age
with
hands
roughened
by
hard
labor
his
face
had
been
browned
by
wind
and
sun
gray
eyes
squinted
as
if
ever
viewing
the
world
with
suspicion
and
hate
are
you
truman
crocker
penny
inquired
curiously
that
my
tag
the
stonecutter
answered
drawing
himself
a
drink
of
water
from
the
well
what
are
you
young
doing
here
oh
our
club
came
to
sketch
penny
returned
you
live
close
by
you
down
yonder
the
man
replied
draining
the
dipper
in
a
thirsty
gulp
i
been
haulin
stone
all
day
it
a
hard
way
to
make
a
living
let
me
tell
you
then
i
come
home
to
find
that
young
rascal
making
off
with
my
chickens
do
you
know
who
he
was
asked
louise
no
but
this
ai
the
first
time
he
paid
me
a
visit
last
week
he
stole
one
of
my
best
rhode
island
reds
i
plumb
disgusted
rhoda
abruptly
arose
from
the
grass
gathering
together
her
sketching
materials
as
if
to
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
she
remarked
it
will
soon
be
dark
girls
i
think
i
should
start
home
we
all
be
leaving
in
a
few
minutes
penny
replied
let
look
around
a
bit
more
though
before
we
go
you
wo
see
nothin
worth
lookin
at
around
here
the
stonecutter
said
contemptuously
this
old
house
ai
much
any
more
there
good
lumber
in
it
though
and
the
foundation
has
some
first
class
stone
you
speak
as
if
you
had
designs
on
it
penny
laughed
it
would
be
a
shame
to
tear
down
a
beautiful
old
house
such
as
this
what
it
good
for
the
man
shrugged
there
ai
no
one
lived
here
in
ten
or
twelve
years
not
since
the
old
lady
went
off
did
you
know
mrs
marborough
oh
we
said
howdy
to
each
other
when
we
meet
but
that
was
the
size
of
it
the
old
lady
did
like
me
none
and
i
thought
the
same
of
her
she
never
wanted
my
chickens
runnin
over
her
yard
ai
it
a
pity
she
see
now
with
a
throaty
sound
half
chuckle
half
sneer
the
man
arose
and
walked
with
the
girls
around
the
house
if
you
want
to
look
inside
there
a
shutter
off
on
the
east
room
window
he
informed
everything
just
like
the
old
lady
left
it
you
do
mean
the
furniture
is
still
in
the
house
rhoda
exclaimed
incredulously
there
ai
nothing
been
changed
i
never
could
figure
why
someone
did
come
in
an
haul
off
her
stuff
but
it
stood
all
these
years
their
curiosity
aroused
the
girls
hastened
to
the
window
that
truman
crocker
had
mentioned
flattening
her
face
against
the
dirty
pane
penny
peered
inside
he
right
she
announced
the
furniture
is
still
covered
by
sheets
why
that
funny
what
is
inquired
louise
impatiently
there
a
lady
hat
lying
on
the
table
it
must
be
quite
out
of
style
by
this
time
louise
laughed
a
hat
penny
said
with
emphasis
and
a
purse
lying
beside
it
at
the
other
side
of
the
house
an
outside
door
squeaked
turning
around
the
group
of
girls
stared
almost
as
if
they
were
gazing
at
a
ghost
an
old
lady
in
a
long
blue
silk
dress
with
lace
collar
and
cuffs
stepped
out
onto
the
veranda
she
gazed
beyond
the
girls
toward
truman
crocker
who
leaned
against
a
tree
seeing
the
woman
he
straightened
to
alert
attention
if
it
ai
priscilla
marborough
he
exclaimed
you
come
back
i
certainly
have
returned
the
old
lady
retorted
with
no
friendliness
in
her
voice
high
time
someone
looked
after
this
place
while
i
been
away
you
seemingly
have
used
my
garden
as
a
chicken
run
how
did
i
know
you
was
ever
coming
back
crocker
demanded
anyhow
the
place
has
gone
to
wrack
and
ruin
a
few
chickens
more
nor
less
make
no
difference
perhaps
not
to
you
truman
crocker
marborough
returned
with
biting
emphasis
you
know
i
am
home
now
so
i
warn
you
keep
your
live
stock
out
of
my
garden
penny
and
her
friends
shared
the
old
stonecutter
chagrin
for
they
too
were
trespassers
waiting
until
the
woman
had
finished
lecturing
crocker
they
offered
an
apology
for
the
intrusion
we
very
sorry
penny
said
speaking
for
the
others
of
course
we
never
dreamed
that
the
house
was
occupied
or
we
would
have
peeped
through
the
window
we
came
because
we
wanted
to
sketch
the
old
wishing
well
and
your
lovely
home
marborough
came
down
the
steps
toward
the
girls
i
quite
understand
she
said
in
a
far
milder
tone
than
she
had
used
in
speaking
to
the
stonecutter
you
may
look
around
as
much
as
you
wish
but
first
tell
me
your
names
one
by
one
they
gave
them
answering
other
questions
which
the
old
lady
asked
she
kept
them
so
busy
that
they
had
no
opportunity
to
interpose
any
of
their
own
but
at
length
penny
managed
to
inquire
marborough
are
you
planning
to
open
up
your
home
again
everyone
would
be
so
happy
if
only
you
should
decide
to
live
here
happy
the
old
lady
repeated
her
eyes
twinkling
well
maybe
some
people
would
be
and
others
would
rose
acres
could
be
made
into
one
of
the
nicest
places
in
riverview
declared
louise
that
would
take
considerable
money
replied
marborough
i
not
made
any
plans
yet
abruptly
she
turned
to
face
truman
crocker
who
was
staring
at
her
must
you
stand
there
gawking
she
asked
with
asperity
get
along
to
your
own
land
and
mind
do
come
here
again
i
not
have
trespassers
you
ai
changed
a
bit
marborough
not
a
particle
the
stonecutter
muttered
as
he
slowly
moved
off
truman
crocker
dismissal
had
been
so
curt
that
penny
and
her
friends
likewise
started
to
leave
the
grounds
you
need
go
unless
you
want
to
marborough
said
her
tone
softening
again
i
never
could
endure
that
loafer
truman
crocker
all
the
stepping
stones
are
gone
from
my
garden
and
i
have
an
idea
what
became
of
them
the
group
of
girls
hesitated
scarcely
knowing
what
to
do
or
say
as
the
silence
became
noticeable
penny
tried
to
make
conversation
by
remarking
that
she
and
her
friends
had
been
especially
interested
in
the
old
wishing
well
is
it
true
that
wishes
made
there
have
come
true
rhoda
wiegand
interposed
eagerly
yes
and
no
the
old
lady
smiled
hundreds
of
wishes
have
been
made
at
the
well
over
the
years
a
surprising
number
of
the
worthwhile
ones
have
been
granted
so
folks
say
tell
me
did
you
say
your
name
is
rhoda
why
yes
the
girl
responded
surprised
that
the
old
lady
had
remembered
rhoda
wiegand
wiegand
odd
i
do
recall
the
name
have
your
parents
lived
many
years
in
riverview
my
mother
and
father
are
dead
marborough
my
brother
and
i
any
living
relatives
and
breen
took
us
in
so
we
would
have
to
go
to
an
orphans
home
they
have
three
children
of
their
own
and
afraid
we
quite
a
burden
where
do
the
breens
live
my
child
we
have
a
trailer
at
the
dorset
tourist
camp
i
always
thought
i
should
enjoy
living
that
way
marborough
declared
big
houses
are
entirely
too
much
work
if
i
decide
to
clean
up
this
place
it
will
take
me
weeks
ca
we
all
help
you
suggested
louise
impulsively
more
than
anything
else
she
longed
to
see
the
interior
of
the
quaint
old
house
thank
you
my
dear
but
i
shall
require
no
assistance
marborough
replied
somewhat
stiffly
obviously
dismissing
the
girls
she
added
do
come
again
whenever
you
like
during
the
bus
ride
to
riverview
the
members
of
the
palette
exchanged
comments
speculating
upon
why
the
old
lady
had
returned
to
the
city
after
such
a
lengthy
absence
one
by
one
they
alighted
at
various
street
corners
until
only
rhoda
penny
and
louise
remained
rhoda
you
have
a
long
ride
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
city
penny
remarked
as
she
and
louise
prepared
to
leave
the
bus
why
not
get
off
here
and
let
me
drive
you
home
in
my
car
it
wo
take
long
to
get
it
from
the
garage
oh
that
would
be
too
much
trouble
rhoda
protested
i
want
to
do
it
penny
insisted
taking
the
girl
by
the
elbow
she
steered
her
to
the
bus
exit
to
louise
she
added
why
not
come
along
with
us
perhaps
i
will
if
you
drive
your
good
car
not
leaping
lena
penny
was
the
proud
possessor
of
two
automobiles
one
a
handsome
maroon
sedan
the
other
a
dilapidated
ancient
flivver
which
had
an
unpleasant
habit
of
running
only
when
fancy
dictated
how
she
had
obtained
two
cars
was
a
story
in
itself
in
fact
several
of
them
the
maroon
model
however
had
been
the
gift
of
penny
devoted
father
anthony
parker
publisher
of
riverview
leading
daily
newspaper
he
had
presented
the
car
to
her
in
gratitude
because
she
had
achieved
an
exclusive
story
for
his
paper
gaining
astounding
evidence
by
probing
behind
a
certain
mysterious
delighted
with
the
gift
penny
promptly
sold
leaping
lena
only
to
become
so
lonesome
for
her
old
friend
that
she
had
bought
it
back
from
a
dealer
in
towing
the
car
home
she
was
involved
in
an
accident
and
there
followed
a
chain
of
amazing
events
which
ultimately
brought
the
solution
of
a
mystery
case
known
as
of
the
silken
leaping
lena
and
trouble
always
went
together
according
to
louise
but
penny
felt
that
every
one
of
her
adventures
had
been
worth
while
i
do
mind
taking
the
maroon
car
she
replied
to
her
chum
in
fact
lena
has
been
running
so
well
lately
i
think
she
has
pneumonia
of
the
carburetor
or
maybe
it
just
old
age
sneaking
up
on
her
louise
added
with
a
teasing
laugh
reaching
the
parker
home
penny
ran
inside
to
tell
weems
the
housekeeper
that
she
was
taking
rhoda
to
the
trailer
camp
returning
a
moment
later
she
backed
the
maroon
car
from
the
garage
with
dazzling
skill
and
further
exhibited
her
prowess
as
a
driver
penny
always
handles
an
automobile
as
if
she
were
enroute
to
a
fire
louise
assured
rhoda
a
reporter
at
the
taught
her
how
to
drive
presently
the
car
arrived
at
the
dorset
tourist
camp
rolling
through
an
archway
entrance
into
a
area
our
trailer
is
parked
over
at
the
north
side
rhoda
said
pointing
to
a
vehicle
with
faded
brown
paint
penny
stopped
the
car
beneath
a
large
maple
tree
immediately
three
small
children
who
had
been
playing
close
by
rushed
up
to
greet
rhoda
their
hands
and
faces
were
very
dirty
frocks
unpressed
and
torn
and
their
hair
appeared
never
to
have
made
contact
with
comb
or
brush
are
these
the
breen
youngsters
inquired
louise
yes
rhoda
answered
offering
no
apology
for
the
way
the
children
looked
this
is
betty
who
is
seven
bobby
is
five
and
jean
is
our
baby
penny
and
louise
had
no
intention
of
remaining
at
the
camp
but
before
they
could
drive
away
breen
stepped
from
the
trailer
she
came
at
once
to
the
car
and
rhoda
introduced
her
i
always
told
rhoda
to
bring
her
friends
out
here
but
she
never
would
do
it
the
woman
declared
heartily
come
inside
and
see
our
trailer
we
really
should
be
going
penny
demurred
i
told
our
housekeeper
be
right
back
it
will
only
take
a
minute
breen
urged
i
want
you
to
meet
my
husband
and
there
ted
the
woman
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
tall
young
man
as
he
moved
hastily
around
the
back
side
of
the
trailer
oh
ted
she
called
shrilly
come
here
and
meet
rhoda
friends
do
bother
about
it
breen
rhoda
said
in
embarrassment
please
nonsense
the
woman
replied
and
called
again
ted
come
here
i
say
with
obvious
reluctance
the
young
man
approached
the
automobile
he
was
tall
and
slim
with
many
of
rhoda
facial
features
penny
felt
certain
that
she
had
seen
him
before
yet
for
a
minute
she
could
not
think
where
how
are
you
the
young
man
responded
briefly
as
he
was
presented
to
the
two
girls
ted
found
a
little
work
to
do
today
breen
resumed
proudly
just
a
few
minutes
ago
he
brought
home
a
nice
plump
chicken
we
having
it
for
dinner
ted
gazed
over
the
woman
head
straight
at
his
sister
seeing
the
look
which
passed
between
them
penny
suddenly
knew
where
she
had
seen
the
young
man
breen
remark
had
given
her
the
required
clue
unquestionably
ted
wiegand
was
the
one
who
had
stolen
the
chicken
from
the
old
stonecutter
chapter
the
discovery
that
rhoda
brother
had
stolen
food
was
disconcerting
to
penny
saying
to
breen
she
prepared
to
drive
away
from
the
trailer
camp
oh
you
ca
go
so
soon
the
woman
protested
you
must
stay
for
dinner
we
having
chicken
and
there
plenty
for
everybody
really
we
ca
remain
penny
declined
louise
and
i
both
are
expected
at
home
you
just
afraid
you
put
me
to
a
little
trouble
breen
laughed
swinging
open
the
car
door
and
tugging
at
penny
hand
you
have
to
stay
taking
a
cue
from
their
mother
the
three
young
children
surrounded
the
girls
fairly
forcing
them
toward
the
trailer
ted
immediately
started
in
the
opposite
direction
you
come
back
here
ted
wiegand
breen
called
in
a
loud
voice
i
do
want
any
dinner
mom
i
know
better
breen
contradicted
cheerfully
you
just
bashful
because
we
having
two
pretty
girls
visit
us
you
stay
and
eat
your
victuals
like
you
always
do
or
i
box
your
ears
okay
ted
agreed
glancing
at
rhoda
again
it
no
use
arguing
with
you
mom
neither
penny
nor
louise
wished
to
remain
for
dinner
yet
they
knew
of
no
way
to
avoid
it
without
offending
breen
briskly
the
woman
herded
them
inside
the
trailer
it
nice
is
it
she
asked
proudly
we
have
a
little
refrigerator
and
a
good
stove
and
a
sink
we
a
bit
crowded
but
that
only
makes
it
more
jolly
a
man
in
shirt
sleeves
lay
on
one
of
the
day
beds
reading
a
newspaper
meet
my
husband
breen
said
as
an
afterthought
get
up
pop
she
ordered
do
you
have
any
manners
the
man
amiably
swung
his
feet
to
the
floor
grinning
at
penny
and
louise
i
ai
been
very
well
lately
he
said
as
if
feeling
that
the
situation
required
an
explanation
the
doc
tells
me
to
take
it
easy
that
was
twenty
years
ago
breen
contributed
an
edge
to
her
voice
pop
been
resting
ever
since
but
we
get
along
rhoda
and
ted
who
had
followed
the
others
into
the
trailer
were
acutely
embarrassed
by
the
remark
penny
hastily
changed
the
subject
to
a
less
personal
one
by
pretending
to
show
an
interest
in
a
book
which
lay
on
the
table
oh
that
belongs
to
rhoda
breen
responded
carelessly
she
brought
it
from
the
library
ted
and
rhoda
always
have
their
noses
in
a
book
they
my
adopted
children
you
know
and
breen
have
been
very
kind
to
us
rhoda
said
quietly
stuff
and
nonsense
breen
retorted
you
more
than
earned
your
keep
well
if
you
excuse
me
now
i
dish
up
dinner
penny
and
louise
wondered
how
so
many
persons
could
be
fed
in
such
a
small
space
especially
as
the
dinette
table
accommodated
only
six
breen
solved
the
problem
by
giving
each
of
the
three
small
children
a
plate
of
food
and
sending
them
outdoors
now
we
can
eat
in
peace
she
remarked
squeezing
her
ample
body
beneath
the
edge
of
the
low
anchored
table
it
a
little
crowded
but
we
can
all
get
in
here
i
take
my
plate
outside
ted
offered
no
you
stay
right
here
breen
reproved
i
never
did
see
such
a
bashful
boy
is
he
the
limit
having
arranged
everything
to
her
satisfaction
she
began
to
dish
up
generous
helpings
of
chicken
and
potato
the
food
had
an
appetizing
odor
and
looked
well
cooked
but
save
for
a
pot
of
tea
there
was
nothing
else
we
having
quite
a
banquet
tonight
pop
breen
remarked
appreciatively
i
take
a
drumstick
ma
if
there
ai
no
one
else
wantin
it
you
take
what
you
get
his
wife
retorted
slapping
the
drumstick
onto
penny
plate
louise
and
penny
made
a
pretense
of
eating
finding
the
food
much
better
than
they
had
expected
neither
ted
nor
rhoda
seemed
hungry
and
breen
immediately
called
attention
to
their
lack
of
appetite
why
ted
what
the
matter
you
not
eating
are
you
sick
the
boy
shook
his
head
and
got
to
his
feet
i
not
hungry
mom
he
mumbled
excuse
me
please
i
have
a
date
with
a
fellow
at
riverview
and
i
have
to
hurry
before
breen
could
detain
him
he
left
the
trailer
i
ca
understand
that
boy
any
more
she
observed
with
a
sad
shake
of
her
head
he
has
been
himself
lately
the
younger
members
of
the
breen
family
quite
made
up
for
ted
and
lack
of
appetite
time
and
again
they
came
to
the
table
to
have
their
plates
refilled
until
all
that
remained
of
the
chicken
was
a
few
bones
penny
and
louise
felt
quite
certain
that
rhoda
realized
what
her
brother
had
done
and
was
deeply
humiliated
by
his
thievery
to
spare
the
girl
further
embarrassment
they
declared
that
they
must
leave
however
as
they
were
presenting
their
excuses
there
was
a
loud
rap
on
the
door
of
the
trailer
peering
from
the
curtained
window
breen
immediately
lost
her
jovial
manner
here
again
she
whispered
what
are
we
going
to
tell
him
pop
just
give
him
the
old
stall
her
husband
suggested
undisturbed
reluctantly
breen
went
to
open
the
door
without
waiting
for
an
invitation
a
man
of
middle
age
entered
the
trailer
penny
immediately
recognized
him
as
jay
franklin
who
owned
the
dorset
tourist
camp
good
afternoon
breen
he
began
his
manner
falsely
cheerful
i
suppose
you
know
why
i
am
here
again
about
the
rent
precisely
franklin
consulted
a
small
booklet
you
are
behind
one
full
month
in
your
payments
as
of
course
you
must
be
aware
the
amount
totals
eight
dollars
pop
pay
the
gentleman
breen
commanded
well
now
i
ai
got
that
much
on
me
her
husband
rejoined
responding
to
his
cue
if
you
drop
around
in
a
day
or
two
franklin
you

stalling
for
weeks
either

your
electric
power

franklin
pleaded
breen

that
to
us
why
with
our
refrigerator
on
the
blink
the
milk
will
sour
and
i
got
three
little
children
the
man
regarded
her
with
cold
dislike
i
am
not
interested
in
your
personal
problems
breen
he
said
delivering
his
ultimatum
either

your
bill
in
full
by
tomorrow
morning
or
move
on
chapter
record
on
what
we
do
breen
murmured
gazing
despairingly
at
her
husband
where
will
we
get
the
money
penny
stepped
forward
into
jay
franklin
range
of
vision
observing
her
for
the
first
time
he
politely
doffed
his
hat
a
courtesy
he
had
not
bestowed
upon
the
breens
franklin
have
you
a
cheque
book
she
inquired
yes
i
have
he
responded
with
alacrity
then
i
write
a
cheque
for
the
eight
dollars
if
that
will
be
satisfactory
penny
offered
the
breens

of
mine

whipping
a
fountain
pen
from
his
pocket
he
offered
it
to
her
penny
we
ca
allow
you
to
assume
our
debts
rhoda
protested
please
do
now
rhoda
it
only
a
loan
to
tide
us
over
for
a
few
days
breen
interposed
ted
will
get
a
job
and
then
we
be
able
to
pay
it
back
penny
wrote
out
the
cheque
and
cutting
short
the
profuse
thanks
of
the
breens
declared
that
she
and
louise
must
return
home
at
once
driving
into
riverview
franklin
inquired
my
car
is
in
the
garage
and
i
appreciate
a
lift
to
town
we
be
glad
to
take
you
franklin
penny
responded
but
without
enthusiasm
enroute
to
riverview
he
endeavored
to
make
himself
an
agreeable
conversationalist
so
the
breens
are
friends
of
yours
he
remarked
casually
well
not
exactly
penny
corrected
i
met
rhoda
at
school
and
visited
her
for
the
first
time
today
i
could
help
feeling
sorry
for
the
family
they
a
lot
the
old
man
never
works
and
the
boy
either
or
wo
get
a
job
do
you
have
many
such
families
mr
franklin
oh
now
and
then
but
i
weed
them
out
as
fast
as
i
can
one
ca
be
soft
and
manage
a
tourist
camp
you
know
penny
smiled
thinking
that
no
person
ever
would
accuse
franklin
of
being
soft
he
had
the
reputation
of
ruthless
devotion
to
his
own
interests
changing
the
subject
she
remarked
that
marborough
had
returned
to
the
city
to
take
up
residence
at
rose
acres
is
that
so
franklin
inquired
showing
interest
in
the
information
will
she
recondition
the
house
penny
replied
that
she
had
no
knowledge
of
the
widow
future
plans
no
doubt
marborough
has
returned
to
sell
the
property
franklin
said
musingly
i
should
like
to
buy
that
place
if
it
goes
for
a
fair
price
i
could
make
money
by
remodeling
it
into
a
tourist
home
it
would
be
a
pity
to
turn
such
a
lovely
place
into
a
roadside
hotel
louise
remarked
disapprovingly
penny
and
i
hope
that
someday
it
will
be
restored
as
it
was
in
the
old
days
there
would
be
no
profit
in
it
as
a
residence
franklin
returned
the
house
is
located
on
a
main
road
though
and
as
a
tourist
hotel
should
pay
conversation
languished
and
a
few
minutes
later
penny
dropped
the
man
at
his
own
home
although
she
refrained
from
speaking
of
it
to
louise
she
neither
liked
nor
trusted
jay
franklin
while
it
had
been
his
right
to
eject
the
breens
from
the
tourist
camp
for
of
rent
she
felt
that
he
could
have
afforded
to
be
more
generous
she
did
not
regret
the
impulse
which
had
caused
her
to
settle
the
debt
even
though
it
meant
that
she
must
deprive
herself
of
a
few
luxuries
after
leaving
louise
at
the
sidell
house
penny
drove
on
home
entering
the
living
room
she
greeted
her
father
who
had
arrived
from
the
newspaper
office
only
a
moment
before
a
late
edition
of
the
star
lay
on
the
table
and
she
glanced
carelessly
at
it
inquiring
what
new
dad
nothing
worthy
of
mention
parker
returned
sinking
down
on
the
davenport
penny
scanned
the
front
page
immediately
her
attention
was
drawn
to
a
brief
item
which
appeared
in
an
inconspicuous
bottom
corner
here
something
she
exclaimed
why
how
strange
what
is
penny
it
says
in
this
story
that
a
big
rock
has
been
found
on
the
farm
of
carl
gleason
the
stone
bears
writing
thought
to
be
of
elizabethan
origin
let
me
see
that
paper
parker
said
striding
across
the
room
i
did
know
any
such
story
was
used
with
obvious
displeasure
the
editor
read
the
brief
item
which
penny
indicated
only
twenty
lines
in
length
it
stated
that
a
stone
bearing
both
elizabethan
and
indian
carving
had
been
found
on
the
nearby
farm
i
do
know
how
this
item
got
past
city
editor
dewitt
parker
declared
it
has
all
the
earmarks
of
a
hoax
you
did
by
chance
write
it
penny
i
certainly
did
not
it
reads
a
little
like
a
jerry
livingston
story
parker
said
glancing
at
the
item
a
second
time
going
to
a
telephone
he
called
first
the
office
and
then
the
home
of
the
reporter
jerry
livingston
after
talking
with
the
young
man
several
minutes
he
finally
hung
up
the
receiver
what
did
he
say
penny
asked
curiously
jerry
wrote
the
story
and
says
it
came
from
a
reliable
source
coming
over
here
to
talk
to
me
about
it
within
ten
minutes
the
reporter
arrived
at
the
parker
home
penny
loitered
in
the
living
room
to
hear
the
conversation
jerry
long
had
been
a
particular
friend
of
hers
and
she
hoped
that
her
father
would
not
reprimand
him
for
any
mistake
he
might
have
made
have
a
chair
parker
greeted
the
young
man
cordially
now
tell
me
where
you
got
hold
of
that
story
straight
from
the
farmer
carl
gleason
jerry
responded
the
stone
was
dug
up
on
his
farm
early
this
morning
did
you
see
it
yourself
not
yet
it
was
hauled
to
the
museum
of
natural
science
thought
drop
around
there
on
my
way
home
and
look
it
over
i
wish
you
would
requested
the
editor
while
the
stone
may
be
an
authentic
one
i
have
a
deep
suspicion
someone
is
trying
to
pull
a
fast
trick
i
sorry
if
i
made
a
boner
chief
oh
i
not
blaming
you
parker
assured
him
if
the
story
is
a
fake
it
was
up
to
dewitt
to
question
it
at
the
desk
better
look
at
the
rock
though
before
you
write
any
more
about
it
as
jerry
arose
to
leave
penny
jumped
up
from
her
own
chair
i
like
to
see
that
stone
too
she
declared
jerry
do
you
mind
if
i
go
along
with
you
glad
to
have
you
he
said
heartily
before
penny
could
get
her
hat
and
coat
maud
weems
the
parker
housekeeper
appeared
in
the
doorway
to
announce
dinner
she
was
a
stout
pleasant
woman
of
and
had
looked
after
penny
since
parker
death
many
years
before
penny
where
are
you
going
now
she
asked
her
voice
disclosing
mild
disapproval
only
over
to
the
museum
you
not
had
your
dinner
oh
yes
i
have
penny
laughed
i
dined
on
chicken
at
the
dorset
tourist
camp
i
be
home
in
an
hour
or
so
jerking
coat
and
hat
from
the
hall
closet
she
fled
from
the
house
before
weems
could
offer
further
objections
jerry
made
a
more
ceremonious
departure
joining
penny
on
the
front
porch
at
the
curb
stood
the
reporter
coupe
the
interior
was
only
slightly
less
dirty
and
before
getting
in
penny
industriously
brushed
off
the
seat
tell
me
all
about
this
interesting
stone
which
was
found
at
the
gleason
farm
she
commanded
as
the
car
started
down
the
street
nothing
to
tell
except
what
was
in
the
paper
jerry
shrugged
the
rock
has
some
writing
on
it
supposedly
similar
to
early
elizabethan
script
and
there
are
a
few
indian
characters
how
could
such
a
stone
turn
up
at
riverview
carl
gleason
found
it
while
he
was
plowing
a
field
apparently
it
had
been
in
the
ground
for
many
years
i
should
think
so
if
it
bears
elizabethan
writing
penny
laughed
why
that
would
date
it
practically
in
shakespeare
time
it
written
in
the
style
used
by
the
earliest
settlers
of
this
country
jerry
said
defensively
you
know
before
we
had
radios
and
automobiles
and
things
this
land
of
ours
was
occupied
by
indians
do
tell
penny
teased
the
natives
camped
all
along
the
river
and
there
may
have
been
an
early
english
settlement
here
so
it
perfectly
possible
that
such
a
stone
could
be
found
anyway
i
am
curious
to
see
it
penny
replied
the
car
drew
up
before
a
large
stone
building
with
doric
columns
climbing
a
long
series
of
steps
to
the
front
door
penny
and
jerry
entered
the
museum
through
a
turnstile
i
want
to
see
the
curator
kaleman
the
reporter
remarked
turning
toward
a
private
office
near
the
entrance
i
be
with
you
in
a
minute
while
waiting
penny
wandered
slowly
about
inspecting
the
various
display
cases
she
was
admiring
the
huge
skeleton
of
a
dinosaur
when
jerry
returned
followed
by
an
elderly
man
who
wore
spectacles
the
reporter
introduced
the
curator
who
began
to
talk
enthusiastically
of
the
ancient
stone
which
had
been
delivered
to
the
museum
that
afternoon
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
show
it
to
you
he
said
leading
the
way
down
a
long
corridor
for
the
present
pending
investigation
we
have
it
stored
in
the
basement
what
the
verdict
jerry
inquired
do
museum
authorities
consider
the
writing
authentic
i
should
not
wish
to
be
quoted
kaleman
prefaced
his
little
speech
however
an
initial
inspection
has
led
us
to
believe
that
the
stone
bears
ancient
writings
you
understand
that
it
will
take
exhaustive
study
before
the
museum
would
venture
to
state
this
as
a
fact
the
stone
could
have
been
faked
penny
asked
thoughtfully
always
that
is
a
possibility
kaleman
acknowledged
as
he
unlocked
the
door
of
a
basement
room
however
the
stone
has
weathered
evenly
it
appears
to
have
been
buried
many
years
and
there
are
other
signs
which
point
to
the
authenticity
of
the
writing
the
curator
switched
on
an
electric
light
which
disclosed
a
room
cluttered
with
miscellaneous
objects
there
were
empty
mummy
cases
boxes
of
excelsior
and
various
stuffed
animals
at
the
rear
of
the
room
was
a
large
rust
colored
stone
which
might
have
weighed
a
quarter
of
a
ton
here
it
is
kaleman
declared
giving
the
rock
an
affectionate
pat
notice
the
uniform
coloring
throughout
and
note
the
lettering
chiseled
on
the
surface
you
will
see
that
the
grooves
do
not
differ
appreciably
from
the
remainder
of
the
stone
as
would
be
the
case
if
the
lettering
were
of
recent
date
it
is
my
belief
do
quote
me
of
course
that
this
writing
may
open
a
new
and
fascinating
page
of
history
penny
bent
to
inspect
the
crude
writing
laeth
ananias
she
read
slowly
aloud
why
that
might
be
a
joke
was
ananias
a
dreadful
prevaricator
ananias
was
a
common
name
in
the
early
days
kaleman
said
displeased
by
the
remark
now
on
the
underside
of
this
stone
which
you
can
not
see
there
appears
part
of
a
quaint
message
which
begins
after
you
goe
for
englande
we
came
hither
what
does
it
mean
questioned
jerry
this
is
only
my
theory
you
understand
i
believe
the
message
may
have
been
written
by
an
early
settler
and
left
for
someone
who
had
gone
to
england
but
expected
to
return
the
writing
breaks
off
suggesting
that
it
may
have
been
continued
on
another
stone
in
that
case
similar
rocks
may
be
found
near
here
jerry
said
thoughtfully
it
is
an
interesting
possibility
on
the
underside
this
stone
also
contains
a
number
of
indian
characters
no
doubt
added
at
a
later
date
so
far
we
have
not
been
able
to
decipher
them
just
why
does
the
stone
have
historical
value
penny
interposed
because
there
never
was
any
proof
that
english
colonists
settled
in
this
part
of
the
state
kaleman
explained
if
we
could
prove
such
were
the
case
our
contribution
to
history
would
be
a
vital
one
penny
and
jerry
asked
many
other
questions
and
finally
left
the
museum
both
had
been
impressed
not
only
with
the
huge
stone
but
by
the
sincere
manner
kaleman
certainly
believes
the
writing
is
genuine
penny
declared
thoughtfully
all
the
same
anyone
knows
a
carved
rock
can
be
made
to
look
very
ancient
and
that
name
ananias
makes
me
wonder
the
chief
may
be
right
about
it
being
a
fake
jerry
returned
but
if
it
is
who
planted
the
stone
on
gleason
farm
and
who
would
go
to
so
much
unnecessary
work
just
to
play
a
joke
frowning
the
reporter
started
to
cross
the
street
just
as
an
automobile
bearing
texas
license
plates
went
past
close
to
the
curb
as
jerry
leaped
backwards
to
safety
the
automobile
halted
two
men
occupied
the
front
seat
and
the
driver
a
man
of
fifty
leaned
from
the
window
excuse
me
sir
he
said
addressing
jerry
we
trying
to
locate
a
boy
named
ted
wiegand
he
and
his
sister
may
be
living
with
a
family
by
the
name
of
breen
could
you
tell
me
how
to
find
them
sorry
but
i
ca
jerry
answered
i
never
heard
either
of
the
names
why
i
know
both
ted
and
rhoda
wiegand
penny
interposed
quickly
they
living
at
the
dorset
tourist
camp
how
do
we
get
there
the
driver
of
the
texas
car
inquired
jerry
provided
the
requested
information
thanking
him
the
stranger
and
his
companion
drove
on
down
the
street
i
wonder
who
they
can
be
penny
speculated
staring
after
the
car
and
why
did
they
come
all
the
way
from
texas
to
see
rhoda
and
ted
friends
of
yours
jerry
asked
carelessly
i
like
rhoda
very
much
ted
seems
to
be
a
rather
questionable
character
i
wonder
you
wonder
what
the
reporter
prompted
helping
penny
into
the
parked
automobile
it
just
came
to
me
jerry
she
answered
gravely
those
men
may
be
officers
from
texas
sent
here
to
arrest
ted
for
something
he
done
i
never
meant
to
set
them
on
his
trail
but
i
may
be
responsible
for
his
arrest
chapter
from
jerry
smiled
broadly
as
he
edged
the
car
from
its
parking
space
by
the
curb
you
certainly
have
a
vivid
imagination
penny
he
accused
those
two
men
did
look
like
men
to
me
anyway
if
ted
wiegand
had
committed
an
illegal
act
would
it
be
your
duty
to
turn
him
over
to
the
authorities
i
suppose
so
penny
admitted
unwillingly
ted
stole
one
of
truman
crocker
chickens
today
it
was
a
dreadful
thing
to
do
but
in
a
way
you
could
blame
him
too
much
i
sure
the
breens
needed
food
stealing
is
stealing
i
do
know
the
lad
but
if
a
fellow
is
crooked
in
small
things
he
usually
dishonest
otherwise
as
well
speaking
of
truman
crocker
he
was
the
man
who
hauled
the
big
rock
to
the
museum
was
he
penny
inquired
not
particularly
interested
in
the
information
i
understand
he
does
a
great
deal
of
rock
hauling
around
riverview
a
queer
fellow
becoming
absorbed
in
her
own
thoughts
penny
had
little
to
say
until
the
car
drew
up
in
front
of
the
parker
home
wo
you
come
in
she
invited
jerry
as
she
alighted
ca
tonight
he
declined
regretfully
i
have
a
date
at
a
bowling
alley
parker
had
been
called
downtown
to
attend
a
meeting
penny
discovered
upon
entering
the
house
unable
to
tell
him
of
her
trip
to
the
museum
she
tried
to
interest
weems
in
the
story
however
the
housekeeper
who
was
eager
to
start
for
a
theatre
soon
cut
her
short
excuse
me
penny
but
i
really
must
be
leaving
or
i
be
late
she
apologized
putting
on
her
hat
i
thought
you
were
interested
in
mystery
mrs
weems
mystery
yes
smiled
the
housekeeper
to
tell
you
the
truth
though
i
ca
become
very
excited
over
an
old
stone
no
matter
what
written
on
it
after
weems
had
gone
penny
was
left
alone
in
the
big
house
she
sat
down
to
read
a
book
but
soon
laid
it
aside
to
pass
the
time
she
thought
she
would
make
a
batch
of
fudge
but
no
sooner
had
she
mixed
the
sugar
and
chocolate
together
than
it
seemed
like
a
useless
occupation
so
she
set
aside
the
pan
for
weems
to
finish
upon
her
return
from
the
movie
i
know
what
i
do
she
thought
suddenly
i
wonder
why
i
did
think
of
it
sooner
hastening
to
the
telephone
she
called
her
chum
louise
asking
her
to
come
over
at
once
what
up
the
other
inquired
curiously
we
going
to
carry
out
a
philanthropic
enterprise
lou
i
tell
you
about
it
when
you
get
here
one
of
these
days
you
choke
on
some
of
those
big
words
louise
grumbled
all
right
i
come
fifteen
minutes
later
she
arrived
at
the
parker
home
to
find
penny
garbed
in
an
apron
working
industriously
in
the
kitchen
say
what
is
this
louise
demanded
suspiciously
if
you
tricked
me
into
helping
you
with
the
dishes
i
going
straight
home
oh
relax
penny
laughed
the
dishes
were
done
hours
ago
we
going
to
help
out
the
old
wishing
well
i
wish
you
would
explain
what
you
mean
it
this
way
lou
the
breens
are
as
poor
as
church
mice
and
they
need
food
at
the
marborough
place
this
afternoon
rhoda
made
a
wish
that
her
family
would
have
more
to
eat
well
it
up
to
us
to
make
that
wish
come
true
you
preparing
a
basket
of
food
to
take
out
to
the
camp
that
the
general
idea
we
can
leave
it
on
the
doorstep
of
the
trailer
and
slip
away
without
revealing
our
identity
why
your
idea
is
a
splendid
one
louise
suddenly
approved
of
course
weems
said
it
would
be
all
right
to
fix
the
basket
of
food
oh
she
wo
mind
i
know
she
would
want
me
to
do
it
if
she
were
here
swinging
open
the
porcelain
door
of
the
ice
box
penny
peered
into
the
illuminated
shelves
the
refrigerator
was
unusually
well
stocked
for
weems
had
baked
that
day
in
anticipation
of
appetites
without
hesitation
penny
handed
out
a
meat
loaf
a
plum
pudding
bunches
of
radishes
scrubbed
carrots
celery
and
a
dozen
fresh
eggs
dash
down
to
the
basement
and
get
some
canned
goods
from
the
supply
shelf
she
instructed
louise
briskly
we
ought
to
have
jelly
too
and
a
sample
of
weems
strawberry
preserves
you
do
the
dashing
if
you
do
mind
her
chum
demurred
i
prefer
not
to
become
too
deeply
involved
in
this
affair
oh
weems
wo
care
not
a
bit
penny
returned
as
she
started
for
the
basement
she
the
most
charitable
person
in
the
world
in
a
minute
she
was
back
her
arms
laden
with
heavy
canned
goods
finding
a
market
basket
in
the
garage
the
girls
packed
the
food
wrapping
perishables
carefully
in
waxed
paper
there
we
ca
crowd
another
thing
into
the
basket
penny
declared
at
last
the
is
as
bare
as
mother
hubbard
cupboard
louise
rejoined
what
will
the
parker
family
eat
tomorrow
oh
weems
can
buy
more
she
be
a
good
sport
about
it
i
know
with
no
misgivings
penny
carried
the
heavy
basket
to
the
garage
and
loaded
it
into
the
car
discovering
that
the
gasoline
gauge
registered
low
she
skillfully
siphoned
an
extra
two
gallons
from
her
father
car
and
then
announced
that
she
was
ready
to
go
do
you
ever
patronize
a
filling
station
louise
inquired
as
her
chum
headed
the
automobile
down
the
street
oh
now
and
then
penny
grinned
after
that
cheque
i
wrote
for
the
breens
rent
i
feeling
rather
poor
dad
is
much
better
able
to
buy
gasoline
than
i
and
he
wo
begrudge
me
a
couple
of
gallons
you
certainly
have
your
family
well
trained
louise
sighed
i
wish
i
knew
how
you
get
by
with
it
the
car
toured
through
riverview
and
presently
arrived
at
the
entrance
of
the
dorset
tourist
camp
an
attendant
stopped
the
girls
but
allowed
them
to
drive
on
when
he
learned
that
they
did
not
wish
to
make
reservations
for
a
cabin
penny
drew
up
not
far
from
where
the
breen
trailer
was
parked
a
light
is
still
burning
there
louise
observed
we
have
to
be
careful
if
we
do
want
to
be
seen
as
penny
lifted
the
heavy
basket
from
the
rear
compartment
of
the
automobile
she
noticed
another
car
standing
not
far
away
it
looked
somewhat
familiar
and
in
studying
it
more
intently
she
noted
the
license
plate
why
it
that
same
texas
car
she
exclaimed
those
men
must
still
be
here
what
car
what
men
oh
this
evening
two
strangers
inquired
the
way
to
this
tourist
camp
penny
explained
briefly
they
said
they
were
looking
for
ted
wiegand
friends
of
his
i
do
know
who
they
were
or
what
they
wanted
it
struck
me
as
odd
though
that
they
would
come
from
such
a
long
distance
whoever
they
are
they
must
be
at
the
trailer
now
louise
said
after
a
moment
should
we
leave
the
basket
on
the
doorstep
or
wait
until
gone
we
ca
very
well
wait
lou
they
might
decide
to
stay
half
the
night
carrying
the
basket
between
them
the
girls
moved
noiselessly
toward
the
trailer
blinds
had
not
been
drawn
and
they
could
see
and
breen
rhoda
and
the
two
men
seated
at
the
table
carrying
on
an
animated
discussion
i
wish
i
knew
why
those
texas
fellows
came
here
penny
remarked
thoughtfully
if
we
wanted
to
find
out
i
not
listen
at
any
window
louise
cut
her
short
i
was
merely
thinking
we
of
course
i
never
would
do
such
an
thing
i
sure
you
wo
louise
replied
with
emphasis
for
a
very
good
reason
too
i
shall
take
you
away
before
temptation
sways
you
depositing
the
basket
of
food
on
the
trailer
doorstep
she
forcibly
pulled
penny
to
the
waiting
car
chapter
wish
at
school
the
next
morning
both
penny
and
louise
eagerly
awaited
some
indication
from
rhoda
wiegand
that
the
basket
of
food
had
been
discovered
by
the
breen
family
the
girl
had
failed
to
appear
at
five
minutes
to
nine
and
they
began
to
wonder
if
she
intended
to
absent
herself
from
classes
oh
by
the
way
what
did
weems
say
about
last
night
little
episode
louise
asked
her
chum
curiously
entirely
too
much
penny
sighed
she
sent
me
three
thousand
words
on
the
budget
problems
of
a
housekeeper
if
you
do
mind
let
allow
the
subject
to
rest
in
peace
it
was
time
for
the
final
school
bell
and
the
two
girls
started
toward
the
assembly
room
just
then
rhoda
breathless
from
hurrying
came
into
the
hallway
her
eyes
sparkled
and
obviously
she
was
rather
excited
girls
something
strange
happened
last
night
she
greeted
penny
and
louise
you
never
guess
we
could
possibly
louise
said
soberly
two
baskets
of
food
were
left
at
the
door
of
our
trailer
it
silly
to
say
it
i
know
but
it
seems
as
if
my
wish
at
the
old
well
must
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
did
you
say
baskets
of
food
were
left
louise
questioned
gazing
sideways
at
penny
yes
one
came
early
in
the
evening
then
this
morning
when
breen
opened
the
door
she
found
still
another
you
do
suppose
any
of
the
members
of
the
palette
club
did
it
do
you
we
should
like
to
accept
charity
i
ask
the
girls
if
you
want
me
to
penny
offered
hastily
if
any
of
them
did
nothing
was
said
about
it
to
me
maybe
the
old
well
granted
your
wish
rhoda
louise
added
you
know
folks
say
it
has
a
reputation
for
doing
good
deeds
the
ringing
of
the
school
bell
brought
the
conversation
to
an
abrupt
end
however
as
louise
and
penny
went
to
their
seats
the
latter
whispered
who
do
you
suppose
left
that
second
basket
on
the
breen
doorstep
probably
one
of
the
other
club
members
had
the
same
idea
you
did
louise
responded
anyway
the
breens
will
be
well
fed
for
a
few
days
at
least
at
recess
penny
made
a
point
of
questioning
every
member
of
the
palette
club
not
one
of
the
girls
would
admit
having
carried
the
basket
to
the
trailer
park
but
all
were
agreed
that
rhoda
should
be
invited
to
join
the
art
organization
without
exception
they
liked
the
girl
after
becoming
acquainted
with
her
the
mystery
deepens
penny
commented
to
louise
as
they
wandered
arm
in
arm
about
the
school
yard
if
no
one
in
the
palette
club
prepared
the
basket
then
who
did
do
it
i
guess
we
have
to
attribute
it
to
the
old
wishing
well
after
all
louise
chuckled
let
me
see
your
ears
my
pet
what
for
do
you
think
i
ever
wash
them
i
merely
want
to
see
if
they
grown
since
we
were
at
the
marborough
place
why
goodness
me
i
believe
they
are
larger
before
penny
could
think
of
a
suitable
retort
rhoda
joined
the
girls
curious
to
learn
more
of
the
two
texas
men
who
had
arrived
in
riverview
they
gave
the
newcomer
every
opportunity
to
speak
of
it
as
she
remained
uncommunicative
penny
brought
up
the
subject
by
mentioning
that
two
strangers
had
asked
her
how
they
might
locate
the
trailer
family
yes
they
found
us
all
right
rhoda
replied
briefly
coaten
came
to
see
ted
an
old
friend
i
suppose
louise
remarked
not
exactly
i
ca
figure
out
just
why
he
did
come
here
rhoda
frowned
and
lapsed
into
silence
penny
and
louise
did
not
question
her
further
and
a
few
minutes
later
recess
ended
the
affairs
of
the
breen
family
concerned
penny
only
slightly
although
she
kept
wondering
why
coaten
and
his
companion
were
in
riverview
she
gave
far
more
thought
to
the
stone
which
had
been
dug
up
on
the
gleason
farm
directly
after
school
she
proposed
to
louise
that
they
drive
into
the
country
and
interview
the
farmer
i
do
mind
the
trip
her
chum
said
but
why
are
you
so
interested
in
an
old
rock
oh
dad
thinks
the
whole
story
may
be
a
hoax
i
like
to
learn
the
truth
if
i
can
mindful
that
in
the
past
penny
had
brought
the
many
an
important
scoop
louise
was
very
willing
to
accompany
her
on
the
trip
found
the
two
girls
at
the
gleason
farm
in
conversation
with
the
old
farmer
i
been
pestered
to
death
ever
since
that
rock
was
found
here
he
told
them
somewhat
crossly
there
nothing
new
to
tell
i
was
plowing
in
the
south
field
back
of
the
barn
when
i
turned
it
up
i
did
pay
much
attention
until
jay
franklin
come
along
and
said
the
writing
on
it
might
interest
the
museum
folks
he
gave
me
a
couple
of
dollars
and
paid
to
have
old
man
crocker
haul
it
to
town
i
did
know
jay
franklin
had
an
interest
in
the
stone
penny
remarked
you
say
he
gave
you
two
dollars
for
it
that
right
the
farmer
nodded
i
was
glad
to
have
the
rock
hauled
off
the
place
satisfied
that
they
could
learn
no
more
penny
and
louise
inspected
the
hole
from
which
the
stone
had
been
removed
and
then
drove
toward
riverview
gleason
seemed
honest
enough
penny
commented
thoughtfully
if
the
rock
was
deliberately
planted
on
his
farm
i
do
believe
he
had
anything
to
do
with
it
he
is
sufficiently
clever
to
plan
and
carry
out
an
idea
like
that
louise
added
maybe
the
writing
on
the
rock
is
genuine
the
curator
of
the
museum
thinks
it
may
be
all
the
same
i
stack
dad
opinion
against
them
all
the
car
approached
the
old
marborough
place
and
penny
deliberately
slowed
down
to
the
surprise
of
the
girls
they
observed
two
automobiles
parked
in
front
of
the
property
it
looks
as
if
marborough
has
guests
today
penny
commented
shall
we
stop
and
say
hello
well
i
do
know
louise
replied
doubtfully
as
the
car
drew
up
at
the
edge
of
the
road
we
not
really
acquainted
with
her
and
with
others
there
they
leaving
now
penny
said
jerking
her
head
to
draw
attention
to
a
group
of
ladies
coming
down
the
walk
toward
the
street
the
visitors
all
were
known
to
the
two
girls
as
women
prominent
in
riverview
club
circles
buckmyer
a
stout
pompous
lady
who
led
the
procession
was
speaking
to
the
others
in
an
agitated
voice
in
all
my
life
i
never
was
treated
with
less
courtesy
marborough
at
least
might
have
invited
us
into
her
house
i
always
understood
that
she
was
a
queer
person
contributed
another
but
one
naturally
would
expect
better
manners
from
a
marborough
i
should
object
to
her
manners
if
only
she
would
allow
the
pilgrimage
committee
the
use
of
her
house
added
a
third
member
of
the
group
what
a
pity
that
she
refuses
to
consider
opening
it
during
the
festival
week
still
chattering
indignantly
the
women
entered
their
separate
cars
and
drove
away
what
did
you
make
of
that
louise
asked
in
perplexity
apparently
marborough
gave
them
the
brush
off
penny
chuckled
i
know
buckmyer
heads
the
pilgrimage
committee
what
that
have
you
heard
about
it
louise
a
group
of
club
women
decided
to
raise
money
by
conducting
a
tour
of
old
houses
in
this
community
there
are
a
number
of
places
which
date
back
over
a
hundred
years
and
people
will
pay
money
to
see
them
that
the
general
idea
festival
week
has
been
set
for
the
of
this
month
during
a
period
the
various
homes
are
open
gardens
will
be
on
display
and
costume
parties
may
be
held
at
them
there
only
one
colonial
house
that
i
care
about
getting
inside
louise
said
i
should
like
to
see
the
interior
of
rose
acres
maybe
we
can
do
it
now
marborough
invited
us
to
visit
her
again
yes
but
did
she
really
mean
it
why
not
find
out
penny
laughed
swinging
open
the
car
door
entering
the
grounds
the
girls
saw
that
very
little
had
been
done
to
the
property
since
their
last
visit
a
attempt
had
been
made
to
rake
one
side
of
the
lawn
and
an
overgrown
lilac
bush
had
been
mercilessly
mutilated
shutters
on
the
house
remained
closed
and
the
entire
place
had
a
gloomy
deserted
appearance
penny
rapped
on
the
door
evidently
marborough
had
noted
the
approach
of
the
two
girls
for
she
responded
to
their
knock
immediately
good
afternoon
penny
began
we
were
driving
by
and
thought
we
would
drop
in
to
see
you
again
how
nice
of
you
marborough
smiled
look
over
the
garden
as
much
as
you
please
the
garden
louise
faltered
gazing
quickly
at
penny
or
make
wishes
at
the
well
marborough
went
on
hastily
go
anywhere
you
like
and
i
join
you
as
soon
as
i
get
a
wrap
the
door
closed
gently
in
their
faces
who
wants
to
see
a
tangle
of
weeds
louise
demanded
in
a
whisper
why
did
marborough
invite
us
into
the
house
why
indeed
echoed
penny
frowning
thoughtfully
there
can
be
but
one
reason
she
has
a
dark
secret
which
she
is
trying
to
hide
from
the
world
chapter
hiding
a
secret
my
eye
laughed
louise
penny
parker
sometimes
i
think
that
every
person
in
riverview
suggests
mystery
and
intrigue
to
you
then
you
explain
why
marborough
does
invite
us
into
her
house
penny
challenged
her
chum
and
why
did
she
turn
the
members
of
the
pilgrimage
committee
away
oh
probably
the
place
is
fixed
up
the
way
she
wants
it
yet
that
no
reason
no
she
has
a
different
one
than
that
lou
and
curious
to
learn
what
it
is
you
always
curious
louise
teased
taking
penny
by
the
arm
come
along
let
get
a
drink
at
the
well
while
the
girls
were
lowering
the
bucket
into
the
bricked
cavern
marborough
joined
them
a
woolen
shawl
thrown
over
her
head
and
shoulders
i
not
had
time
to
get
much
work
done
yet
she
apologized
i
really
must
hire
a
man
to
clean
up
the
grounds
then
you
have
decided
to
make
your
home
here
louise
inquired
eagerly
for
the
present
i
may
much
depends
upon
how
a
certain
project
turns
out
penny
and
louise
waited
hopefully
but
marborough
said
no
more
changing
the
subject
she
inquired
about
rhoda
wiegand
and
the
other
members
of
the
palette
club
i
like
young
people
she
declared
brightly
do
tell
your
friends
to
come
to
rose
acres
whenever
they
wish
a
rather
strange
thing
occurred
yesterday
penny
said
suddenly
rhoda
made
a
wish
here
at
the
well
and
it
came
true
what
was
the
wish
the
old
lady
inquired
with
curiosity
that
the
people
with
whom
she
lives
might
have
more
food
two
baskets
were
left
at
the
trailer
camp
louise
and
i
were
responsible
for
one
of
them
but
we
ca
account
for
the
other
very
interesting
marborough
commented
in
years
past
a
great
many
wishes
which
were
made
here
apparently
came
true
so
i
ca
say
that
i
am
surprised
to
what
do
you
attribute
it
louise
asked
quickly
chance
perhaps
marborough
smiled
one
can
not
explain
such
things
a
chill
penetrating
wind
blew
from
the
direction
of
the
river
shivering
louise
drew
her
jacket
collar
closer
about
her
neck
remarking
rather
pointedly
that
the
weather
was
turning
colder
even
then
marborough
did
not
suggest
that
the
girls
enter
the
house
a
moment
later
however
she
excused
herself
and
went
inside
leaving
them
alone
in
the
garden
it
does
seem
odd
that
she
acts
so
secretive
louise
commented
inclined
to
agree
with
members
of
the
pilgrimage
committee
that
her
manners
are
the
best
perhaps
you
finally
decide
that
i
am
right
penny
said
triumphantly
take
my
word
for
it
there
something
inside
the
house
she
does
want
anyone
to
see
louise
started
slowly
toward
the
road
only
to
pause
as
her
chum
proposed
that
they
walk
to
the
river
and
call
upon
truman
crocker
the
stonecutter
you
intend
to
tell
him
who
stole
his
chicken
louise
asked
in
surprise
penny
shook
her
head
no
i
let
him
discover
it
for
himself
i
want
to
talk
to
him
about
that
big
rock
he
hauled
to
the
museum
louise
could
not
imagine
what
useful
information
her
chum
might
expect
to
gain
but
she
obediently
trailed
penny
through
the
rear
yard
of
rose
acres
down
a
sloping
path
which
led
to
the
river
i
hope
you
know
the
way
she
remarked
dubiously
as
the
going
became
more
difficult
and
they
were
forced
to
move
slowly
oh
we
ca
miss
the
cabin
crocker
place
is
the
only
one
near
here
penny
responded
the
trail
was
a
narrow
one
so
infrequently
used
that
bushes
and
vines
had
overgrown
it
in
many
places
finally
emerging
on
an
open
hillside
the
girls
were
able
to
gaze
down
upon
the
winding
river
recent
rains
had
swollen
it
to
the
very
edges
of
the
banks
and
from
a
distance
truman
crocker
shack
appeared
to
be
situated
dangerously
close
to
the
water
would
you
think
he
would
soon
be
flooded
out
louise
commented
pausing
to
catch
her
breath
i
should
care
to
live
so
near
the
river
oh
the
water
never
comes
much
higher
penny
rejoined
a
few
years
ago
the
city
built
some
sort
of
river
control
system
which
takes
care
of
the
spill
should
there
be
any
anyway
crocker
place
would
represent
much
of
a
loss
if
it
did
wash
away
the
girls
regained
their
breath
and
then
started
down
the
slope
penny
who
was
leading
the
way
did
not
pay
particular
attention
to
the
rutty
path
suddenly
catching
her
shoe
in
a
small
hole
she
tripped
and
fell
sideways
ooh
my
arm
she
squealed
i
struck
it
on
a
big
rock
louise
helped
penny
to
her
feet
brushing
dirt
from
the
girl
skirt
you
ripped
your
stocking
she
said
sympathetically
i
guess
i
lucky
it
was
my
head
penny
returned
gazing
ruefully
at
the
tear
let
sit
down
and
rest
a
minute
seating
herself
on
the
large
smooth
rock
she
gingerly
examined
a
bruised
place
on
her
elbow
louise
stood
beside
her
plucking
burs
from
her
chum
sweater
i
all
right
now
penny
said
a
moment
later
getting
up
why
lou
do
you
see
what
i
been
sitting
on
a
rock
my
pet
a
stone
that
looks
exactly
like
the
one
at
the
museum
penny
cried
excitedly
all
rocks
are
pretty
much
alike
are
they
certainly
not
penny
corrected
there
are
any
number
of
varieties
this
one
is
quartz
unless
i
mistaken
and
it
resemble
the
one
at
the
museum
maybe
you
can
find
some
writing
on
it
louise
teased
the
rock
only
weighs
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
shall
i
lift
it
for
you
so
you
can
see
the
under
side
do
bother
penny
retorted
eagerly
examining
the
stone
already
found
it
found
what
the
writing
i
this
stone
looked
like
the
one
at
the
museum
louise
was
certain
that
her
chum
merely
pretended
to
have
made
such
an
important
discovery
however
as
penny
continued
to
examine
the
rock
in
an
intent
absorbed
way
she
decided
to
see
for
herself
why
it
true
she
exclaimed
incredulously
there
writing
on
the
stone
carved
letters
so
dimmed
by
age
and
weathering
processes
that
they
scarcely
remained
legible
had
been
cut
unevenly
in
the
hard
surface
hence
vnto
heaven
louise
deciphered
slowly
why
would
date
this
stone
almost
before
there
were
known
settlers
in
the
country
almost
but
not
quite
replied
penny
historians
believe
there
were
other
settlements
before
that
date
obviously
this
is
a
burial
stone
similar
to
the
one
found
on
the
gleason
farm
if
it
such
an
old
rock
why
was
it
never
discovered
before
the
stone
may
be
a
fake
but
that
not
for
us
to
try
to
figure
out
we
made
an
important
discovery
and
the
museum
is
sure
to
be
interested
do
forget
that
this
is
on
marborough
property
louise
reminded
her
chum
we
have
to
tell
her
about
it
retracing
their
way
to
rose
acres
the
girls
knocked
on
the
door
marborough
soon
appeared
looking
none
too
pleased
by
their
unexpected
return
what
is
it
she
asked
blocking
the
doorway
so
that
the
girls
could
not
see
beyond
her
into
the
living
room
breathlessly
penny
told
of
finding
the
dated
stone
on
the
hillside
did
you
know
such
a
rock
was
there
she
asked
eagerly
i
never
seen
any
stone
with
writing
on
it
marborough
replied
goodness
knows
there
are
plenty
of
boulders
on
my
property
though
another
stone
similar
to
it
was
found
yesterday
on
the
gleason
farm
louise
revealed
do
come
and
see
it
mrs
marborough
before
the
widow
could
reply
the
three
were
startled
by
heavy
footsteps
on
the
veranda
turning
the
girls
saw
that
jay
franklin
had
approached
without
being
observed
politely
he
doffed
his
hat
excuse
me
i
could
help
overhearing
your
conversation
he
said
bowing
again
to
marborough
you
were
saying
something
about
a
rock
which
bears
writing
we
found
it
on
the
hillside
near
here
penny
explained
it
has
a
date
then
it
must
be
a
mate
to
the
stone
discovered
by
mr
gleason
i
sure
it
is
will
you
take
me
to
the
spot
where
you
found
it
franklin
requested
i
am
tremendously
interested
of
course
penny
agreed
but
her
voice
lacked
enthusiasm
she
glanced
toward
louise
noticing
that
her
chum
did
not
look
particularly
elated
either
neither
could
have
explained
the
feeling
but
jay
franklin
arrival
detracted
from
the
pleasure
of
their
discovery
although
ashamed
of
their
suspicions
they
were
afraid
that
the
man
might
try
to
take
credit
for
finding
the
stone
chapter
moving
as
if
to
confirm
the
thought
of
the
two
girls
jay
franklin
remarked
that
should
the
newly
discovered
stone
prove
similar
to
the
one
found
at
the
gleason
farm
he
would
immediately
have
it
hauled
to
the
riverview
museum
is
that
for
marborough
to
decide
penny
asked
dryly
the
rock
is
on
her
land
you
know
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
franklin
nodded
brushing
aside
the
matter
of
ownership
as
if
it
were
of
slight
consequence
marborough
had
gone
into
the
house
for
a
coat
reappearing
she
followed
franklin
and
the
two
girls
down
the
trail
where
the
huge
stone
lay
did
you
ever
notice
this
rock
penny
questioned
the
mistress
of
rose
acres
never
she
replied
but
then
i
doubt
that
i
ever
walked
in
this
particular
locality
before
jay
franklin
stooped
to
examine
the
carving
excitedly
declaring
that
it
was
similar
to
the
marking
of
the
gleason
stone
and
here
are
other
characters
he
exclaimed
fingering
grooves
which
had
escaped
penny
attention
indian
picture
writing
how
do
you
account
for
two
types
of
carving
on
the
same
stone
louise
inquired
skeptically
the
indian
characters
may
have
been
added
at
a
later
date
franklin
answered
for
all
we
know
this
rock
may
be
one
of
the
most
valuable
relics
ever
found
in
our
state
from
the
historical
standpoint
of
course
the
stone
has
no
commercial
value
i
imagine
the
museum
will
want
it
penny
said
thoughtfully
exactly
what
i
was
thinking
franklin
turned
toward
marborough
to
ask
you
would
not
object
to
the
museum
having
this
stone
why
no
she
replied
it
has
no
value
to
me
then
with
your
permission
i
arrange
to
have
it
hauled
to
riverview
without
delay
i
buy
the
stone
from
you
the
museum
is
entirely
welcome
to
it
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
museum
will
refuse
the
stone
in
that
event
you
would
have
the
expense
of
hauling
it
away
again
by
purchasing
it
outright
i
can
relieve
you
of
all
responsibility
giving
marborough
no
opportunity
to
protest
the
real
estate
man
forced
a
crisp
two
dollar
bill
into
her
unwilling
hand
there
he
said
jovially
now
i
am
the
owner
of
the
stone
i
just
run
down
to
truman
crocker
place
and
ask
him
to
do
the
hauling
for
me
the
wind
was
cold
and
after
franklin
had
gone
marborough
went
quickly
to
the
house
leaving
the
girls
to
await
his
return
i
knew
something
like
this
would
happen
penny
declared
in
annoyance
now
it
franklin
stone
and
the
next
thing
we
know
he
claim
that
he
discovered
it
too
louise
nodded
gloomily
replying
that
only
bad
luck
had
brought
the
real
estate
agent
to
rose
acres
that
particular
afternoon
i
have
a
sneaking
notion
he
came
here
to
buy
marborough
house
penny
said
musingly
he
thinks
it
would
make
a
good
tourist
place
for
half
an
hour
the
girls
waited
patiently
neither
jay
franklin
nor
truman
crocker
appeared
so
at
last
they
decided
it
was
a
waste
of
time
to
remain
longer
arriving
at
home
shortly
before
the
dinner
hour
penny
found
her
father
there
ahead
of
her
to
her
surprise
she
learned
that
he
already
knew
of
the
stone
which
had
been
discovered
at
rose
acres
information
certainly
travels
fast
she
commented
i
suppose
jay
franklin
must
have
peddled
the
story
the
minute
he
reached
town
yes
he
called
at
the
office
to
report
he
had
found
a
stone
similar
to
the
one
unearthed
at
the
gleason
farm
parker
nodded
found
it
penny
cried
indignantly
oh
i
knew
that
old
publicity
seeker
would
steal
all
the
credit
louise
and
i
discovered
that
rock
and
i
hope
you
say
so
in
the
franklin
let
it
drop
that
he
will
offer
the
stone
to
the
museum
for
five
hundred
dollars
well
of
all
the
cheap
tricks
penny
exclaimed
her
indignation
mounting
he
bought
that
rock
for
two
dollars
pretending
he
meant
to
give
it
to
the
museum
just
wait
until
marborough
hears
about
it
suppose
you
tell
me
the
facts
parker
invited
penny
obligingly
revealed
how
she
had
found
the
rock
by
stumbling
against
it
in
descending
a
steep
path
to
the
river
upon
learning
of
the
transaction
which
jay
franklin
had
concluded
with
marborough
parker
smiled
ruefully
franklin
always
did
have
a
special
talent
for
making
money
the
easy
way
he
declared
i
be
sorry
to
see
him
cheat
the
museum
dad
you
do
think
kaleman
will
be
foolish
enough
to
pay
money
for
that
rock
penny
asked
in
dismay
i
am
afraid
he
may
he
seems
convinced
that
the
gleason
stone
is
a
genuine
specimen
you
still
believe
the
writing
to
be
faked
i
do
parker
responded
i
stake
my
reputation
upon
it
i
said
as
much
to
jay
franklin
today
and
he
rather
pointedly
hinted
that
he
would
appreciate
having
me
keep
my
theories
entirely
to
myself
i
guess
he
does
understand
you
very
well
penny
smiled
now
be
more
determined
than
ever
to
expose
the
hoax
if
hoax
it
is
franklin
action
thoroughly
annoyed
her
for
she
felt
that
he
had
deliberately
deceived
marborough
wishing
to
tell
louise
sidell
what
he
had
done
she
immediately
telephoned
her
chum
i
learned
something
you
want
to
hear
she
disclosed
no
i
tell
you
over
the
meet
me
directly
after
dinner
we
might
go
for
a
sail
on
the
river
the
previous
summer
parker
had
purchased
a
small
sailboat
which
he
kept
at
a
summer
camp
on
the
river
occasionally
he
enjoyed
an
outing
but
work
occupied
so
much
of
his
time
that
his
daughter
and
her
friends
derived
far
more
enjoyment
from
the
craft
than
he
did
louise
accepted
the
invitation
with
alacrity
and
later
that
evening
driving
to
the
river
with
penny
listened
indignantly
to
a
colored
account
of
how
jay
franklin
would
profit
at
the
widow
expense
she
agreed
with
her
chum
that
he
had
acted
dishonestly
in
trying
to
sell
the
stone
perhaps
marborough
can
claim
ownership
even
now
she
suggested
thoughtfully
not
without
a
lawsuit
penny
offered
as
her
opinion
she
sold
the
rock
to
franklin
for
two
dollars
remember
his
final
words
i
am
the
owner
of
the
stone
oh
he
intended
to
trick
her
even
then
the
car
turned
into
a
private
dirt
road
and
soon
halted
beside
a
cabin
of
logs
a
cool
breeze
came
from
the
river
but
the
girls
were
prepared
for
it
having
worn
warm
slack
suits
it
a
grand
night
to
sail
penny
declared
leading
the
way
to
the
boathouse
we
should
get
as
far
as
the
marborough
place
if
the
breeze
holds
launching
the
dinghy
louise
raised
the
sail
while
her
chum
took
charge
of
the
tiller
as
the
canvas
filled
the
boat
heeled
slightly
and
began
to
pick
up
speed
now
use
discretion
louise
warned
as
the
dinghy
tilted
farther
and
farther
sideways
it
all
very
well
to
sail
on
the
bias
but
i
prefer
not
to
get
a
ducking
during
the
trip
up
the
river
the
girls
were
kept
too
busy
to
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
night
however
as
the
boat
approached
truman
shack
the
breeze
suddenly
died
barely
providing
steerage
way
holding
the
tiller
by
the
pressure
of
her
knee
penny
slumped
into
a
position
want
me
to
steer
for
awhile
louise
inquired
not
until
we
turn
and
start
for
home
we
have
the
current
with
us
then
which
will
help
even
if
the
breeze
has
died
curiously
penny
gazed
toward
truman
crocker
cabin
which
was
entirely
dark
high
on
the
hillside
stood
the
old
marborough
mansion
and
there
too
no
lights
showed
everyone
seems
to
have
gone
to
bed
she
remarked
it
must
be
late
louise
held
her
watch
so
that
she
could
read
the
figures
in
the
bright
moonlight
and
observed
that
it
was
only
a
quarter
past
ten
anyway
we
should
be
starting
for
home
penny
said
coming
about
louise
prepared
to
lower
her
head
as
the
boom
swung
over
but
to
her
surprise
the
maneuver
was
not
carried
through
instead
of
turning
the
dinghy
kept
steadily
on
its
course
what
the
idea
she
demanded
is
there
enough
breeze
to
carry
us
around
i
was
watching
that
light
up
on
the
hill
penny
explained
louise
twisted
in
the
seat
to
look
over
her
shoulder
what
light
penny
it
gone
now
but
i
saw
it
an
instant
ago
there
it
is
again
unmistakably
both
girls
saw
the
moving
light
far
up
the
hill
as
they
watched
it
seemed
to
approach
the
dark
marborough
house
and
then
receded
probably
someone
with
a
lantern
louise
remarked
indifferently
but
why
should
anyone
be
prowling
about
marborough
place
at
this
hour
it
does
seem
strange
deliberately
penny
steered
the
sailboat
toward
the
beach
i
think
we
should
investigate
she
declared
firmly
everyone
knows
marborough
lives
alone
someone
may
be
attempting
to
break
into
the
house
chapter
oh
penny
there
must
be
a
perfectly
good
reason
for
that
moving
light
louise
protested
as
the
boat
grated
on
the
sand
you
only
want
an
excuse
for
going
to
the
marborough
place
perhaps
her
chum
acknowledged
with
a
grin
jump
out
and
pull
us
in
will
you
please
my
ankles
are
nice
and
dry
and
i
like
them
that
way
louise
retorted
if
it
all
the
same
you
do
the
jumping
all
right
i
do
mind
much
with
a
laugh
penny
gingerly
stepped
from
the
dinghy
into
shallow
water
she
pulled
the
boat
farther
up
onto
the
shore
so
that
her
chum
was
able
to
climb
out
without
wetting
her
feet
together
they
furled
the
sail
and
removed
the
steering
apparatus
which
they
hid
in
the
nearby
bushes
i
do
see
a
light
now
louise
protested
after
their
various
tasks
had
been
completed
must
we
climb
that
steep
hill
we
must
penny
declared
firmly
taking
her
by
the
hand
something
may
be
wrong
at
marborough
and
we
ought
to
find
out
about
it
you
just
love
to
investigate
things
louise
accused
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
there
not
likely
to
be
anything
amiss
someone
may
be
prowling
about
the
grounds
at
any
rate
my
feet
are
cramped
from
sitting
so
long
in
the
boat
we
need
exercise
finding
a
trail
the
girls
climbed
it
until
they
were
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
marborough
mansion
emerging
from
behind
a
clump
of
lilac
bushes
they
suddenly
obtained
an
unobstructed
view
of
the
yard
there
the
light
penny
whispered
see
by
the
wishing
well
to
their
knowledge
the
girls
had
made
no
unusual
sound
yet
apparently
the
person
who
prowled
in
the
yard
was
aware
of
their
approach
as
they
watched
the
lantern
was
extinguished
simultaneously
the
moon
which
had
been
so
bright
moved
under
a
dark
cloud
for
several
seconds
the
girls
could
not
see
the
shadowy
figure
by
the
well
when
the
moon
again
emerged
from
behind
its
shield
no
one
was
visible
in
the
yard
whoever
was
there
has
hidden
penny
whispered
excitedly
louise
after
we
leave
he
may
attempt
to
break
into
the
house
what
ought
we
to
do
i
think
we
should
warn
mrs
marborough
the
house
is
dark
louise
said
dubiously
she
probably
in
bed
would
you
want
to
know
about
it
if
someone
were
prowling
about
your
premises
yes
of
course
but
then
come
on
penny
urged
starting
through
the
tangle
of
tall
grass
marborough
should
be
very
grateful
for
the
warning
it
may
prevent
a
burglary
in
crossing
the
yard
the
girls
kept
an
alert
watch
of
the
bushes
but
could
see
no
one
hiding
behind
them
nevertheless
they
felt
certain
that
the
prowler
could
not
have
left
the
grounds
penny
pounded
on
the
rear
door
of
the
marborough
house
not
so
loud
louise
warned
nervously
marborough
probably
is
asleep
i
want
to
awaken
her
you
will
do
worry
penny
repeated
the
knock
many
times
and
then
was
rewarded
by
the
approach
of
footsteps
the
door
opened
and
marborough
in
lace
night
cap
and
flannel
robe
peered
suspiciously
at
the
girls
what
do
you
want
she
asked
crossly
why
do
you
awaken
me
at
such
an
hour
do
you
remember
us
penny
said
stepping
into
the
light
we
mean
to
startle
you
startle
me
fiddlesticks
i
am
merely
annoyed
at
being
awakened
from
a
sound
slumber
i
terribly
sorry
penny
apologized
we
would
bother
you
but
we
saw
someone
with
a
lantern
moving
about
in
the
yard
we
were
afraid
a
burglar
might
try
to
break
into
the
house
marborough
gazed
carefully
about
the
yard
i
see
no
light
she
said
stiffly
it
gone
now
louise
admitted
as
we
came
up
from
the
river
we
distinctly
saw
it
near
the
old
wishing
well
penny
and
i
thought
that
whoever
it
was
hid
behind
the
bushes
you
both
imagined
you
saw
a
light
the
old
lady
said
with
biting
emphasis
in
any
case
i
am
not
afraid
of
prowlers
my
doors
have
good
bolts
and
i
be
more
than
a
match
for
anyone
who
tries
to
get
inside
thank
you
for
your
interest
in
my
behalf
but
really
i
am
able
to
look
after
myself
i
sorry
penny
apologized
meekly
there
your
intentions
were
good
marborough
said
in
a
more
kindly
tone
better
go
home
now
and
forget
it
young
girls
should
be
abroad
at
such
a
late
hour
after
the
door
had
closed
penny
and
louise
slowly
retraced
their
way
to
the
river
edge
someday
i
learn
never
to
pay
attention
to
your
crazy
ideas
penny
parker
louise
said
breaking
a
lengthy
silence
you
saw
the
light
did
you
i
thought
so
but
i
not
sure
of
anything
now
it
may
have
come
from
the
main
road
sorry
but
i
disagree
replied
penny
oh
well
if
marborough
wishes
to
be
robbed
i
suppose
it
her
own
affair
launching
the
dinghy
the
girls
spread
their
canvas
and
sailing
before
what
wind
there
was
presently
reached
the
parker
camp
penny
father
awaited
them
by
the
boathouse
and
helped
to
haul
in
the
craft
the
girls
did
not
tell
parker
of
their
little
adventure
but
the
next
day
at
school
they
discussed
it
at
considerable
length
during
the
night
no
attempt
had
been
made
by
anyone
to
break
into
the
marborough
house
nevertheless
penny
was
unwilling
to
dismiss
the
affair
as
one
of
her
many
mistakes
she
was
still
thinking
about
the
affair
as
she
wandered
into
the
library
a
few
minutes
before
class
time
rhoda
wiegand
sat
at
one
of
the
tables
and
appeared
troubled
hello
rhoda
penny
greeted
as
she
searched
for
a
book
on
the
shelf
you
must
have
an
examination
coming
up
from
the
way
you
are
frowning
am
i
the
older
girl
asked
smiling
i
was
thinking
hard
the
truth
is
i
am
rather
puzzled
i
like
puzzles
rhoda
if
you
have
a
knotty
problem
why
not
test
it
on
me
i
doubt
if
you
can
help
me
with
this
one
penny
do
you
remember
those
two
texas
men
i
told
you
about
yes
of
course
i
do
trust
them
rhoda
said
briefly
coaten
has
offered
to
adopt
ted
and
me
adopt
you
penny
exclaimed
is
that
why
they
came
here
seemingly
it
is
coaten
wants
to
become
our
legal
guardian
i
understand
why
he
should
show
such
interest
in
us
i
thought
the
breens
were
looking
after
you
and
ted
they
took
us
in
because
we
had
no
one
else
we
never
were
adopted
and
the
truth
is
we
a
financial
burden
is
coaten
an
old
friend
i
never
met
him
until
he
came
to
riverview
he
and
his
friend
carl
addison
claim
they
were
closely
associated
with
my
father
neither
ted
nor
i
ever
heard
papa
speak
of
them
when
he
was
alive
it
does
seem
strange
they
should
show
such
sudden
interest
in
you
penny
commented
thoughtfully
you
have
no
property
they
might
wish
to
control
ted
and
i
have
a
penny
to
our
names
papa
never
owned
land
and
what
cash
he
had
was
absorbed
by
his
last
sickness
then
perhaps
coaten
really
is
a
friend
i
wish
i
could
think
so
but
i
ca
penny
i
just
feel
that
he
has
a
selfish
purpose
behind
his
apparent
kindness
it
worries
me
because
i
ca
figure
it
out
then
of
course
you
not
agree
to
the
adoption
i
do
want
to
penny
ted
favors
it
and
so
does
breen
you
see
coaten
has
been
very
generous
with
his
money
rhoda
indicated
a
new
dress
which
she
wore
he
gave
me
this
he
made
breen
accept
money
and
he
giving
ted
things
too
if
he
really
a
friend
of
the
family
i
never
believe
that
he
is
rhoda
interrupted
never
the
ringing
of
the
school
bell
brought
the
conversation
to
an
end
but
all
during
the
morning
penny
thought
of
what
the
girl
had
told
her
knowing
nothing
concerning
the
characters
of
the
two
strangers
she
could
not
judge
their
motives
another
matter
caused
penny
considerable
annoyance
the
morning
paper
had
carried
a
brief
item
about
the
record
stone
found
at
the
marborough
mansion
from
her
father
she
had
learned
that
instead
of
delivering
the
rock
to
the
museum
jay
franklin
had
hauled
it
to
his
own
home
offering
it
for
sale
to
the
highest
bidder
penny
felt
that
marborough
should
be
told
what
had
occurred
yet
neither
she
nor
louise
were
eager
to
visit
rose
acres
again
after
last
night
i
had
enough
of
that
place
louise
declared
as
they
discussed
the
matter
marborough
was
very
rude
to
us
even
so
we
should
tell
her
what
jay
franklin
has
done
penny
insisted
let
go
right
after
school
i
ca
louise
declined
i
planned
a
shopping
tour
then
immediately
after
dinner
penny
persisted
i
stop
by
for
you
in
the
car
as
it
developed
various
duties
kept
both
girls
so
busy
that
it
was
dusk
before
they
actually
drove
toward
rose
acres
louise
protested
that
considering
what
had
occurred
the
previous
night
it
was
much
too
late
to
call
on
the
widow
marborough
surely
wo
be
abed
before
eight
penny
answered
carelessly
if
the
house
should
be
dark
we
can
drive
away
without
disturbing
her
louise
made
another
protest
but
knew
that
as
usual
penny
would
get
her
way
a
few
minutes
later
the
automobile
swung
around
a
bend
directly
ahead
loomed
the
old
colonial
mansion
its
windows
without
lights
we
may
as
well
turn
back
louise
observed
penny
slackened
speed
gazing
toward
the
unkempt
grounds
louise
she
exclaimed
tensely
there
it
is
again
the
light
where
louise
demanded
in
disbelief
i
do
see
it
as
she
spoke
the
car
passed
beyond
a
tall
clump
of
azalea
bushes
bordering
the
property
through
its
branches
both
girls
saw
a
light
which
appeared
to
be
motionless
it
a
lantern
covered
with
a
cloth
to
prevent
a
bright
glow
louise
discerned
and
it
close
to
the
wishing
well
penny
added
in
a
thrilled
voice
lou
there
something
queer
going
on
at
this
place
let
find
out
about
it
how
louise
asked
forgetting
that
she
had
decided
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
her
chum
ideas
let
drive
past
the
house
and
park
up
the
road
penny
proposed
with
a
delighted
chuckle
then
we
steal
back
afoot
and
see
what
we
can
see
chapter
the
louise
offered
no
serious
objection
to
penny
proposal
for
she
too
was
curious
to
learn
who
might
be
prowling
about
the
marborough
yard
driving
on
down
the
road
for
a
considerable
distance
they
parked
the
car
just
off
the
pavement
and
walked
back
to
the
estate
a
high
hedge
bounded
the
front
side
of
the
marborough
property
but
they
were
able
to
peer
through
the
scanty
foliage
into
the
yard
it
will
be
just
our
luck
that
the
light
has
disappeared
penny
muttered
i
do
see
it
anywhere
i
do
louise
whispered
excitedly
look
over
there
by
the
wishing
well
in
the
darkness
both
girls
could
see
the
faint
glow
of
a
covered
lantern
which
had
been
deposited
on
the
ground
a
shadowy
figure
was
bending
over
examining
some
object
on
the
ground
can
you
tell
who
it
is
penny
murmured
not
from
here
dare
we
move
closer
let
risk
it
penny
said
and
led
the
way
through
the
open
gateway
taking
the
precaution
to
keep
tall
bushes
between
themselves
and
the
wishing
well
the
girls
quietly
stole
closer
soon
they
were
near
enough
to
distinguish
that
someone
in
dark
clothing
was
kneeling
on
the
ground
face
turned
away
from
them
apparently
the
person
was
trying
to
lift
one
of
the
flagstones
which
formed
a
circular
base
about
the
covered
well
who
can
he
be
penny
whispered
pausing
and
what
is
he
doing
at
that
moment
the
figure
straightened
and
the
lantern
was
lifted
from
the
ground
it
a
not
a
he
louise
observed
in
an
undertone
mrs
marborough
it
looks
like
her
from
here
louise
nodded
but
what
can
she
be
doing
at
the
well
completely
mystified
the
girls
remained
motionless
watching
marborough
raised
one
of
the
flagstones
and
peered
beneath
it
she
searching
for
something
penny
whispered
probably
she
works
after
dark
so
she
wo
be
observed
it
was
evident
to
both
girls
that
the
moving
light
which
had
attracted
their
attention
the
previous
night
had
undoubtedly
been
marborough
lantern
although
they
now
could
understand
the
old
lady
irritation
at
their
intrusion
her
actions
mystified
them
as
they
continued
to
watch
she
pried
up
one
stone
after
another
frequently
resting
from
her
labors
we
might
offer
to
help
her
louise
proposed
if
we
show
ourselves
now
she
order
us
never
to
return
penny
replied
we
want
to
find
out
what
this
is
all
about
during
the
next
ten
minutes
the
girls
huddled
behind
the
friendly
bush
at
the
end
of
that
period
marborough
gathered
together
her
tools
and
went
wearily
into
the
house
obviously
she
did
find
what
she
was
after
penny
said
coming
from
behind
the
shelter
what
do
you
suppose
it
can
be
buried
treasure
perhaps
or
possibly
the
family
silverware
hidden
during
the
civil
war
penny
chuckled
i
afraid
not
marborough
lived
at
rose
acres
all
her
early
years
if
there
had
been
anything
valuable
buried
would
she
have
done
her
searching
long
ago
if
that
a
question
i
ca
answer
it
sighed
louise
what
our
next
move
home
i
should
say
not
let
inspect
the
wishing
well
penny
started
forward
taking
pains
to
avoid
a
patch
of
light
which
came
from
the
lower
windows
of
the
marborough
house
even
in
the
the
girls
were
able
to
see
that
many
flagstones
about
the
well
had
been
removed
and
fitted
again
into
place
just
for
luck
i
shall
make
a
wish
penny
announced
unexpectedly
lowering
the
bucket
into
the
pit
what
will
it
be
this
time
louise
inquired
slightly
amused
penny
drank
deeply
of
the
cool
sweet
water
and
tossed
a
token
into
the
well
i
wish
that
rose
acres
would
give
us
a
whopping
big
mystery
she
said
gaily
lou
why
did
marborough
return
to
riverview
after
being
away
so
many
years
this
is
her
ancestral
home
true
but
did
she
tell
us
that
whether
or
not
she
remains
here
depends
upon
certain
conditions
lou
she
must
have
had
a
very
special
reason
for
coming
and
it
may
be
connected
with
this
wishing
well
we
ought
to
find
out
about
it
why
why
penny
fairly
wailed
oh
lou
at
times
you
the
most
exasperating
person
here
we
are
face
to
face
with
something
baffling
and
you
wonder
why
we
should
interest
ourselves
in
it
i
like
mystery
as
well
as
you
but
you
know
marborough
wo
care
to
have
us
interfere
in
her
private
affairs
probably
not
penny
conceded
oh
well
we
can
forget
all
about
it
if
that
the
way
you
feel
how
could
we
learn
anything
without
provoking
mrs
marborough
i
know
of
no
way
penny
admitted
in
fact
she
probably
be
irritated
when
i
rap
on
her
door
again
louise
followed
her
chum
down
the
path
toward
the
house
ought
we
bother
marborough
now
she
asked
in
mild
protest
she
may
think
we
have
been
spying
on
her
which
of
course
we
never
would
consider
doing
penny
chuckled
paying
no
heed
to
louise
she
boldly
clomped
across
the
veranda
and
knocked
on
the
door
the
girls
did
not
have
long
to
wait
in
a
moment
marborough
appeared
looking
decidedly
flustered
and
nervous
who
is
it
she
asked
sharply
and
then
recognized
the
girls
oh
i
see
marborough
do
excuse
us
penny
began
hastily
i
learned
something
which
i
feel
sure
you
wish
to
hear
you
seen
another
light
in
the
yard
perhaps
the
old
lady
inquired
her
voice
slightly
mocking
penny
glanced
at
louise
uncertain
what
to
say
in
reply
there
has
been
no
one
in
my
yard
either
last
night
or
this
evening
marborough
resumed
tartly
i
appreciate
your
interest
in
my
welfare
but
i
can
only
repeat
that
i
am
quite
capable
of
looking
after
myself
we
came
to
tell
you
about
that
big
rock
which
we
discovered
on
the
hillside
penny
interposed
do
you
care
to
hear
what
jay
franklin
did
despite
herself
marborough
was
interested
she
hesitated
and
then
came
outside
carefully
closing
the
door
behind
her
the
peculiar
action
was
not
lost
upon
the
girls
it
quite
chilly
out
tonight
penny
said
significantly
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
step
inside
i
do
mind
a
little
fresh
air
marborough
replied
now
what
is
it
that
you
wish
to
tell
me
feeling
far
from
comfortable
penny
explained
how
jay
franklin
had
kept
the
big
rock
as
his
own
property
and
was
endeavoring
to
sell
it
to
the
museum
at
a
handsome
profit
but
he
told
me
he
would
give
the
stone
to
the
institution
marborough
exclaimed
indignantly
will
you
see
franklin
tomorrow
i
can
penny
nodded
then
if
you
do
ask
him
to
come
here
and
see
me
as
if
the
matter
were
completely
settled
marborough
started
to
reënter
the
house
she
did
not
invite
the
girls
to
accompany
her
however
sensing
that
they
were
puzzled
by
her
lack
of
hospitality
she
said
apologetically
i
would
invite
you
in
only
the
house
is
fixed
up
yet
after
everything
is
cleaned
and
straightened
you
both
must
come
to
tea
without
giving
the
girls
an
opportunity
to
say
that
they
should
mind
a
disorderly
house
she
gently
closed
the
door
well
at
least
marborough
did
slam
it
in
our
faces
this
time
penny
remarked
cheerfully
lou
we
making
progress
progress
toward
what
louise
demanded
i
not
sure
yet
penny
laughed
as
they
started
for
their
car
all
the
same
i
have
a
feeling
that
we
on
our
way
chapter
franklin
morning
dad
penny
greeted
her
father
as
she
slid
into
a
vacant
chair
at
the
breakfast
table
what
news
and
why
no
news
parker
lowered
his
paper
and
folding
it
devoted
himself
to
a
plate
of
bacon
and
eggs
just
fourteen
pages
of
type
i
suppose
is
there
anything
about
that
big
stone
lou
and
i
found
at
the
marborough
place
not
a
line
i
told
you
the
would
play
that
yarn
down
why
are
you
so
convinced
it
all
a
hoax
penny
demanded
reaching
across
the
table
for
the
coffee
percolator
must
i
give
you
a
diagram
the
publisher
asked
wearily
after
been
in
the
newspaper
business
as
long
as
i
have
you
do
need
reasons
you
sense
things
just
like
a
bloodhound
penny
teased
how
about
the
other
papers
are
they
carrying
the
story
either
they
are
parker
admitted
a
bit
grimly
the
used
a
half
page
of
pictures
today
and
went
for
the
story
in
a
big
way
i
may
subscribe
to
a
rival
paper
just
to
keep
posted
on
the
latest
developments
penny
teased
nothing
really
new
has
come
out
jay
franklin
is
trying
to
sell
the
marborough
stone
to
the
museum
at
a
fancy
price
and
the
institution
officials
are
seriously
considering
his
proposition
then
in
their
opinion
the
stone
is
an
authentic
one
experts
have
been
known
to
be
wrong
parker
insisted
i
claim
no
knowledge
of
ancient
writing
but
i
do
have
common
sense
for
the
time
being
at
least
i
shall
continue
to
play
down
the
story
penny
finished
breakfast
and
before
starting
to
school
telephoned
jay
franklin
relaying
marborough
message
she
requested
him
to
visit
the
old
lady
as
soon
as
it
was
convenient
somewhat
to
her
surprise
he
promised
that
he
would
call
at
rose
acres
that
afternoon
during
school
penny
kept
thinking
about
the
marborough
stone
and
her
father
theory
that
the
writing
and
symbols
it
bore
were
fakes
it
occurred
to
her
that
truman
crocker
opinion
might
be
interesting
for
the
old
man
had
worked
with
rocks
his
entire
life
let
hike
out
to
his
shack
this
afternoon
she
impulsively
proposed
to
louise
sidell
all
right
her
chum
agreed
why
not
invite
rhoda
too
she
might
enjoy
accompanying
us
upon
being
approached
the
trailer
camp
girl
immediately
accepted
the
invitation
since
the
last
meeting
of
the
palette
club
nearly
all
of
the
students
had
been
very
kind
to
her
but
she
seemed
rather
indifferent
to
everyone
save
louise
and
penny
as
the
three
girls
trudged
along
the
dusty
road
to
the
river
shack
rhoda
spoke
of
coaten
and
his
friend
who
still
remained
in
riverview
they
taken
a
room
at
the
riverview
hotel
she
told
penny
and
louise
perhaps
i
am
too
suspicious
but
i
do
trust
them
coaten
never
would
seem
like
a
father
to
me
is
he
married
louise
questioned
curiously
his
wife
remained
in
dallas
the
coatens
have
two
children
of
their
own
i
ca
understand
why
they
should
be
so
eager
to
adopt
two
more
penniless
at
that
what
will
you
do
louise
inquired
i
do
know
ted
and
i
are
deadlocked
he
favors
the
adoption
but
i
am
against
it
i
think
you
are
wise
to
be
cautious
and
my
advice
is
firm
penny
declared
promptly
the
breens
were
kind
enough
to
take
you
in
when
you
had
no
friends
so
why
not
stay
on
with
them
that
the
trouble
rhoda
confessed
they
have
much
money
you
know
and
coaten
has
offered
to
give
them
a
hundred
dollars
if
they
make
no
objection
to
the
adoption
buying
them
off
penny
commented
in
a
way
yes
but
why
should
coaten
be
so
interested
in
adopting
ted
and
me
we
certainly
be
a
financial
liability
the
problem
was
such
a
perplexing
one
that
neither
penny
nor
louise
could
offer
any
convincing
answer
considering
everything
rhoda
had
told
them
it
appeared
that
coaten
must
be
motivated
entirely
by
generosity
yet
it
seemed
odd
that
if
he
were
an
old
family
friend
he
had
not
interested
himself
in
their
case
at
the
time
of
wiegand
death
choosing
a
trail
which
led
along
the
river
the
girls
soon
came
to
truman
crocker
shack
it
was
a
long
frame
building
which
served
the
dual
purpose
of
dwelling
and
shop
the
door
of
the
workroom
stood
ajar
and
the
stonecutter
could
be
seen
grinding
a
granite
block
good
afternoon
penny
said
in
a
loud
voice
to
make
herself
heard
the
stonecutter
jumped
from
surprise
and
switched
off
a
running
motor
you
scared
me
out
of
a
year
growth
he
grinned
well
what
can
i
do
for
you
not
much
of
anything
penny
responded
glancing
with
interest
about
the
cluttered
workshop
we
were
just
out
for
a
walk
and
thought
we
would
stop
in
for
a
few
minutes
her
attention
drawn
to
a
large
rock
which
had
been
covered
with
wet
sacking
she
crossed
the
room
to
examine
it
iron
filings
had
been
sprinkled
on
the
covering
and
she
knew
that
they
must
have
a
special
purpose
what
is
this
for
she
inquired
curiously
oh
i
removing
discoloration
from
a
stone
crocker
answered
do
touch
the
sacking
leave
it
alone
what
do
you
do
with
the
rock
after
you
finish
working
on
it
louise
asked
crossing
the
room
to
stand
beside
penny
i
sell
it
crocker
returned
briefly
i
have
work
to
do
and
waiting
to
get
at
it
oh
we
did
mean
to
interrupt
you
penny
apologized
the
truth
is
we
came
here
to
ask
you
about
that
stone
you
hauled
for
jay
franklin
do
you
think
the
writing
on
it
is
genuine
sure
it
is
anyone
who
knows
anything
about
stones
could
tell
it
had
been
lying
in
the
ground
for
years
the
aging
could
have
been
faked
say
what
is
this
crocker
demanded
scowling
what
are
you
trying
to
get
at
my
father
who
publishes
the
believes
that
someone
may
be
perpetrating
a
hoax
a
what
crocker
asked
puzzled
by
the
word
a
joke
he
thinks
that
some
person
may
have
faked
the
writing
on
the
two
stones
well
i
did
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
truman
crocker
declared
his
tone
unpleasant
i
hauled
the
rock
for
jay
franklin
and
that
all
i
know
about
it
now
go
away
and
do
pester
me
we
the
same
as
absent
right
now
penny
laughed
retreating
to
the
doorway
thanks
for
your
splendid
cooperation
what
that
never
mind
you
would
understand
penny
replied
goodbye
a
safe
distance
from
the
shack
the
three
girls
expressed
their
opinion
of
the
old
stonecutter
manners
he
acted
as
if
we
were
suspicious
of
him
louise
declared
such
a
simple
fellow
it
never
once
entered
my
head
that
crocker
could
have
any
connection
with
the
hoax
assuming
that
the
writing
is
genuine
penny
said
but
now
that
i
think
of
it
why
would
he
be
a
logical
person
to
do
such
a
trick
he
far
too
stupid
louise
maintained
why
i
doubt
that
he
ever
went
through
eighth
grade
in
school
likely
he
never
even
heard
of
elizabethan
writing
all
true
penny
conceded
but
could
someone
have
employed
him
if
he
were
told
to
carve
a
rock
in
such
and
such
a
manner
i
sure
he
could
carry
out
instructions
perfectly
he
knows
more
about
such
work
than
anyone
in
this
community
oh
penny
you
quite
hopeless
louise
laughed
just
let
anyone
rebuff
you
and
immediately
you
try
to
pin
a
crime
on
him
i
not
accusing
truman
crocker
of
anything
at
least
not
yet
all
the
same
those
two
stones
were
found
quite
close
to
his
shack
the
gleason
farm
is
more
than
of
a
mile
away
why
should
crocker
be
interested
in
playing
such
a
joke
rhoda
inquired
dubiously
or
for
that
matter
any
other
person
i
ca
figure
it
out
penny
acknowledged
if
the
stones
are
fakes
one
would
judge
them
to
be
the
creation
of
a
rather
brilliant
practical
joker
are
you
sure
you
did
do
it
yourself
louise
asked
teasingly
after
all
you
were
the
one
who
found
the
second
stone
so
that
throws
suspicion
on
you
penny
allowed
the
subject
to
die
with
a
quick
change
of
interest
she
suggested
to
her
companions
that
they
return
to
riverview
by
way
of
the
marborough
place
do
you
think
we
showing
ourselves
there
too
frequently
louise
protested
mildly
there
such
a
thing
as
wearing
out
one
welcome
oh
we
need
try
to
break
into
the
house
penny
grinned
but
if
we
do
go
there
we
never
learn
any
more
about
the
mystery
louise
and
rhoda
were
not
particularly
eager
to
climb
the
hill
however
to
oblige
penny
they
offered
no
objection
to
her
proposal
approaching
the
marborough
property
five
minutes
later
the
girls
were
startled
to
hear
loud
angry
voices
the
sound
came
from
the
direction
of
the
old
wishing
well
someone
is
having
a
fearful
argument
penny
declared
quickening
her
step
as
the
three
friends
emerged
into
the
clearing
they
saw
marborough
and
jay
franklin
sitting
together
on
a
garden
bench
the
widow
was
speaking
in
a
voice
reprimanding
the
caller
for
having
misled
her
regarding
the
record
stone
found
on
her
land
she
giving
it
to
him
right
and
i
glad
penny
chuckled
let
not
go
any
closer
louise
murmured
holding
back
penny
stared
at
her
chum
in
blank
amazement
not
go
closer
she
demanded
why
this
is
why
we
came
i
thought
franklin
might
be
here
and
i
want
to
hear
what
he
has
to
say
for
himself
chapter
neither
louise
nor
rhoda
approved
of
interfering
in
the
argument
between
marborough
and
franklin
but
as
usual
they
could
not
stand
firm
against
penny
making
considerable
noise
to
give
warning
of
their
approach
the
girls
drew
near
the
garden
bench
your
conduct
has
amazed
and
disappointed
me
they
heard
the
old
lady
say
in
clipped
words
when
i
allowed
you
to
remove
the
stone
from
my
yard
you
promised
that
you
would
deliver
it
to
the
museum
i
may
have
mentioned
such
a
possibility
but
i
made
no
promise
franklin
replied
you
sold
the
rock
to
me
it
is
now
mine
to
do
with
as
i
see
fit
you
deliberately
tricked
me
i
am
less
concerned
with
the
money
than
with
the
fact
that
you
are
trying
to
force
the
museum
to
pay
for
something
which
i
meant
them
to
have
free
marborough
you
sold
the
rock
for
two
dollars
unless
i
am
very
much
mistaken
that
money
meant
more
to
you
than
you
would
have
the
townspeople
believe
marborough
arose
from
the
bench
glaring
at
the
visitor
franklin
you
are
insulting
leave
my
premises
this
minute
and
never
return
i
be
very
happy
to
depart
the
man
retorted
smiling
coldly
i
came
here
only
because
you
sent
for
me
however
if
you
were
inclined
to
take
a
sensible
viewpoint
i
might
make
you
a
business
proposition
what
do
you
mean
by
that
mr
franklin
i
refer
to
this
house
here
if
you
disposed
to
sell
it
i
might
make
you
an
offer
marborough
had
started
toward
the
house
but
then
she
paused
and
regarded
him
speculatively
what
is
your
offer
mr
franklin
i
give
you
fifteen
hundred
for
the
house
and
grounds
fifteen
hundred
the
old
lady
exclaimed
shrilly
for
a
house
which
cost
at
least
forty
thousand
to
build
are
you
being
outrageously
reckless
old
houses
are
a
drug
on
the
market
these
days
madam
you
find
no
other
buyer
in
riverview
i
am
quite
sure
in
fact
i
would
make
you
such
a
generous
offer
except
that
i
think
this
place
might
be
fixed
up
as
a
tourist
home
a
tourist
home
marborough
cried
furiously
you
would
make
this
beautiful
colonial
mansion
into
a
cheap
hotel
oh
go
away
and
never
never
show
your
face
here
again
very
well
madam
franklin
responded
still
smiling
however
i
warn
you
that
my
next
offer
for
the
property
will
not
be
as
generous
a
one
generous
marborough
fairly
screamed
for
she
was
determined
to
have
the
final
word
your
price
would
be
robbery
you
just
like
your
father
who
was
one
of
the
worst
skinflints
i
ever
knew
franklin
had
nothing
more
to
say
with
a
shrug
he
turned
and
strode
from
the
yard
marborough
gazed
after
him
for
a
moment
and
then
sinking
down
on
the
stone
bench
began
to
cry
hearing
footsteps
behind
her
she
turned
her
head
and
saw
the
three
girls
hastily
she
dabbed
at
her
eyes
with
a
lace
handkerchief
oh
marborough
do
feel
badly
penny
said
quickly
we
heard
what
he
said
to
you
franklin
should
be
ashamed
of
himself
that
man
does
affect
me
one
way
or
the
other
the
old
lady
announced
with
a
toss
of
the
head
the
girls
accepted
the
explanation
with
tranquil
faces
although
they
knew
very
well
why
marborough
had
wept
rhoda
wandered
to
the
wishing
well
peering
down
into
the
water
do
you
know
i
tempted
to
make
another
wish
she
remarked
would
it
be
very
selfish
of
me
selfish
louise
inquired
puzzled
the
last
one
came
true
i
should
expect
too
much
do
make
your
wish
rhoda
urged
penny
but
do
anticipate
quick
action
i
still
waiting
for
mine
to
come
true
rhoda
drew
a
bucket
of
water
from
the
well
and
filling
the
dipper
which
always
hung
on
a
nail
of
the
wooden
roof
drank
deeply
i
wish
she
said
soberly
i
wish
that
ted
might
find
a
job
if
he
could
get
work
maybe
it
would
be
necessary
to
accept
charity
from
coaten
or
anyone
rhoda
wish
so
earnestly
spoken
slightly
embarrassed
the
others
for
it
served
to
remind
them
of
the
girl
poverty
now
you
make
one
penny
louise
urged
to
cover
an
awkward
silence
i
ca
think
of
anything
i
want
penny
answered
well
i
can
marborough
announced
unexpectedly
in
all
the
years
of
my
life
i
never
made
a
wish
at
this
well
but
now
i
shall
to
the
delight
of
the
girls
she
reached
for
the
bucket
of
water
with
a
grim
face
she
slammed
the
entire
contents
back
into
the
well
just
a
little
token
o
wishing
well
she
muttered
my
desire
is
a
most
worthy
one
all
i
ask
is
that
jay
franklin
be
given
his
we
all
second
that
wish
penny
added
gaily
there
marborough
declared
rather
pleased
with
herself
that
makes
me
feel
better
now
i
forget
that
man
and
go
about
my
business
i
think
it
was
selfish
of
him
to
take
the
attitude
he
did
about
the
stone
penny
said
wishing
to
keep
an
entertaining
topic
alive
marborough
seemed
to
have
lost
all
interest
in
the
subject
gathering
her
long
skirts
about
her
she
started
for
the
house
midway
up
the
flagstone
path
she
paused
to
say
there
a
tree
of
nice
summer
apples
out
yonder
by
the
back
fence
pick
all
you
like
and
take
some
home
if
you
care
for
them
thank
you
marborough
louise
responded
politely
after
the
door
had
closed
behind
the
old
lady
the
girls
did
not
immediately
leave
the
vicinity
of
the
wishing
well
she
means
to
be
kind
louise
commented
drawing
figures
in
the
dirt
with
her
shoe
but
is
it
funny
she
never
invites
us
into
the
house
it
downright
mysterious
penny
added
you
notice
jay
franklin
get
in
there
either
why
does
she
act
that
way
rhoda
asked
in
perplexity
penny
thinks
she
trying
to
keep
folks
from
discovering
something
explained
louise
the
old
lady
is
queer
in
other
ways
too
thoroughly
enjoying
the
tale
the
girls
told
rhoda
how
they
had
observed
marborough
removing
the
flagstones
surrounding
the
base
of
the
wishing
well
there
been
more
digging
penny
suddenly
cried
springing
up
from
the
bench
see
excitedly
she
pointed
to
a
place
where
additional
flagstones
had
been
lifted
and
carelessly
replaced
marborough
must
have
been
at
work
again
louise
agreed
what
does
she
expect
to
find
fishing
worms
perhaps
rhoda
suggested
with
a
smile
under
the
flagstones
would
be
a
good
place
marborough
never
would
go
fishing
louise
answered
sometimes
i
wonder
if
she
entirely
right
in
her
mind
it
just
is
normal
to
go
around
digging
on
your
own
property
after
night
do
you
worry
marborough
knows
what
she
is
about
penny
declared
she
looking
for
something
which
is
hidden
but
what
can
it
be
louise
speculated
nothing
she
does
seems
to
make
sense
she
one
of
the
most
interesting
characters
i
met
in
many
a
day
penny
said
warmly
i
like
her
better
all
the
time
how
about
those
apples
rhoda
suggested
changing
the
subject
sure
breen
could
use
some
of
them
as
the
girls
started
toward
the
gnarled
old
tree
a
battered
automobile
drew
up
in
front
of
the
house
a
man
who
was
dressed
in
coat
and
trousers
taken
from
two
separate
suits
alighted
and
came
briskly
up
the
walk
who
is
he
louise
whispered
curiously
never
saw
him
before
penny
admitted
he
looks
almost
like
a
tramp
or
an
old
clothes
man
rhoda
added
with
a
laugh
observing
the
girls
the
man
doffed
his
battered
derby
is
this
where
marborough
lives
he
asked
yes
she
is
inside
louise
replied
bowing
again
the
man
presented
himself
at
the
front
door
hammering
it
loudly
with
the
brass
knocker
marborough
will
make
short
work
of
him
penny
laughed
she
so
friendly
to
visitors
before
the
girls
could
walk
on
to
the
apple
tree
marborough
opened
the
door
mr
butterworth
she
asked
without
waiting
for
the
man
to
speak
yes
come
in
invited
marborough
her
voice
impersonal
the
caller
stepped
across
the
threshold
and
the
door
swung
shut
did
you
see
that
louise
whispered
stunned
by
the
ease
with
which
the
man
had
gained
admittance
i
certainly
did
penny
murmured
that
fellow
whoever
he
is
has
accomplished
something
that
even
riverview
society
ladies
achieve
maybe
i
was
puzzled
before
but
now
let
me
tell
you
completely
tied
in
a
knot
chapter
silken
as
penny
approached
the
school
grounds
the
following
morning
she
heard
her
name
called
a
moment
later
rhoda
wiegand
breathless
from
running
caught
up
with
her
penny
the
most
wonderful
thing
has
happened
she
exclaimed
your
texas
friends
have
left
town
the
other
guessed
rhoda
shook
her
head
unfortunately
it
not
quite
that
wonderful
they
still
here
this
news
is
about
my
brother
ted
he
has
a
job
why
that
splendid
exactly
what
you
wished
for
yesterday
afternoon
at
the
well
penny
does
it
seem
strange
rhoda
asked
soberly
this
makes
twice
my
wish
has
come
true
how
do
you
account
for
it
i
suppose
your
brother
could
have
obtained
the
job
through
accident
penny
answered
that
would
be
the
logical
explanation
but
it
all
came
about
in
such
an
unusual
way
judge
harlan
saw
ted
on
the
street
and
liked
his
appearance
so
he
sent
a
note
to
the
camp
asking
if
he
would
work
as
a
typist
in
his
office
ted
is
accepting
oh
yes
the
pay
is
splendid
for
that
sort
of
work
besides
it
will
give
him
a
chance
to
study
law
which
is
his
life
ambition
oh
penny
you
ca
know
how
happy
i
am
about
it
at
the
recess
penny
reported
the
conversation
to
louise
both
girls
were
pleased
that
ted
wiegand
had
obtained
employment
but
it
did
seem
peculiar
to
them
that
the
judge
would
go
to
such
lengths
to
gain
the
services
of
a
young
man
of
questionable
character
perhaps
he
wants
to
help
him
louise
speculated
ted
is
at
the
critical
point
of
his
life
now
he
could
develop
into
a
very
fine
person
or
just
the
opposite
it
charity
of
course
but
who
put
the
judge
up
to
it
marborough
heard
rhoda
express
her
wish
yes
she
did
penny
agreed
but
i
do
think
she
paid
much
attention
she
was
too
angry
at
jay
franklin
besides
marborough
does
have
a
reputation
for
doing
kind
deeds
if
you
rule
her
out
there
nothing
left
but
the
old
wishing
well
louise
laughed
i
might
be
tempted
to
believe
it
has
unusual
powers
if
ever
it
would
do
anything
for
me
grumbled
penny
not
a
single
one
of
my
wishes
has
been
granted
a
mystery
seems
to
be
developing
at
rose
acres
louise
reminded
her
i
not
learned
anything
new
since
i
made
my
wish
marborough
has
decided
to
cooperate
with
the
pilgrimage
committee
either
the
festival
week
program
which
so
interested
penny
had
been
set
for
the
twentieth
of
the
month
and
the
days
immediately
following
gardens
were
expected
to
be
at
their
height
at
that
time
and
the
owners
of
seven
fairly
old
houses
had
agreed
to
open
their
doors
to
the
public
both
penny
and
louise
had
helped
sell
tickets
for
the
motor
pilgrimage
but
sales
resistance
was
becoming
increasingly
difficult
to
overcome
the
affair
may
be
a
big
flop
penny
remarked
to
her
chum
no
one
wants
to
pay
a
dollar
to
see
a
house
which
is
particularly
interesting
now
rose
acres
would
draw
customers
the
women
of
riverview
are
simply
torn
with
curiosity
to
get
in
there
i
do
believe
marborough
ever
will
change
her
mind
neither
do
i
penny
agreed
gloomily
two
days
elapsed
during
which
nothing
happened
according
to
the
viewpoint
of
the
girls
from
rhoda
they
learned
that
ted
was
well
established
in
his
new
job
and
that
coaten
seemed
displeased
about
it
parker
reported
that
jay
franklin
had
made
progress
in
his
efforts
to
sell
the
marborough
stone
to
the
riverview
museum
other
than
that
there
was
no
news
no
developments
of
interest
louise
let
visit
truman
crocker
again
penny
proposed
on
saturday
afternoon
when
time
hung
heavily
what
good
would
it
do
louise
demurred
you
know
very
well
he
like
to
have
us
around
he
acted
suspicious
of
us
which
made
me
suspicious
of
him
i
been
thinking
lou
if
the
writing
on
those
two
stones
were
faked
it
must
have
been
done
with
a
chisel
one
which
would
leave
a
characteristic
mark
every
tool
is
slightly
different
you
know
all
of
which
leads
you
to
conclude
that
if
truman
crocker
did
the
faking
he
would
have
a
tool
in
his
workshop
that
would
make
grooves
similar
to
those
on
the
stones
an
expert
might
compare
them
and
tell
do
we
consider
ourselves
experts
of
course
not
penny
said
impatiently
but
if
i
could
get
the
right
tool
i
could
turn
it
over
to
someone
who
knows
about
such
things
so
you
propose
to
go
out
to
the
shack
today
and
appropriate
a
tool
i
buy
it
from
crocker
perhaps
i
can
convince
him
i
want
to
chisel
a
tombstone
for
myself
or
something
of
the
sort
i
used
to
think
you
were
just
plain
crazy
penny
parker
louise
declared
sadly
lately
you
reached
the
stage
where
adjectives
are
too
weak
to
describe
you
a
half
hour
later
found
the
two
girls
at
the
crocker
shack
the
door
of
the
workshop
stood
open
but
as
penny
and
louise
peered
inside
they
saw
no
sign
of
the
old
stonecutter
a
number
of
tools
lay
on
a
bench
where
crocker
had
been
working
and
with
no
hesitation
penny
examined
them
here
is
a
chisel
she
said
in
satisfaction
it
seems
to
be
the
only
one
around
too
just
what
i
need
penny
you
would
dare
take
it
in
my
official
capacity
as
a
detective
yes
i
leave
more
than
enough
money
to
pay
for
it
then
after
i
had
it
examined
by
an
expert
return
it
to
mr
crocker
o
mystery
what
crimes
are
committed
in
thy
name
louise
warbled
if
you
land
in
jail
my
dear
penny
do
expect
me
to
share
your
cell
cot
i
take
all
the
responsibility
selecting
a
bill
from
her
purse
penny
laid
it
in
a
conspicuous
place
on
the
workbench
there
that
should
buy
three
or
four
chisels
she
declared
now
leave
here
before
truman
crocker
arrives
emerging
from
the
shop
penny
and
louise
were
surprised
to
see
dark
storm
clouds
scudding
overhead
the
sun
had
been
completely
blotted
out
and
occasional
flashes
of
lightning
brightened
a
gray
sky
it
going
to
rain
before
we
can
get
to
riverview
louise
declared
uneasily
we
be
drenched
why
not
go
by
way
of
marborough
place
penny
proposed
then
if
the
rain
does
overtake
us
we
can
dodge
into
the
summer
house
until
the
shower
passes
over
hastening
toward
the
hillside
trail
the
girls
observed
that
the
river
level
was
higher
than
when
last
they
had
seen
it
muddy
water
lapped
almost
at
the
doorstep
of
truman
crocker
shack
a
rowboat
tied
to
a
half
submerged
dock
nearby
swung
restlessly
on
its
long
rope
i
should
be
afraid
to
live
so
close
to
the
river
louise
remarked
if
the
water
comes
only
a
few
feet
higher
crocker
place
will
sail
south
the
river
control
system
is
supposed
to
take
care
of
everything
penny
answered
carelessly
dad
says
he
does
place
much
faith
in
it
himself
not
if
it
ever
put
to
a
severe
test
before
the
girls
had
gone
far
a
few
drops
of
rain
splattered
down
anticipating
a
deluge
they
ran
for
the
dilapidated
summer
house
which
stood
at
the
rear
edge
of
marborough
property
completely
winded
they
sank
down
on
a
dusty
wooden
bench
to
recapture
their
breath
the
clouds
are
rolling
eastward
louise
remarked
scanning
the
sky
it
may
not
rain
much
after
all
lou
penny
said
in
a
startled
voice
she
was
gazing
toward
the
old
wishing
well
at
a
dark
figure
which
could
be
seen
bending
far
over
the
yawning
hole
what
is
it
louise
inquired
turning
in
surprise
look
over
there
penny
directed
marborough
is
doing
something
at
the
well
is
she
trying
to
repair
it
or
what
she
examining
the
inside
louise
exclaimed
why
if
she
not
careful
she
may
fall
we
ought
to
warn
her
marborough
knows
what
she
is
about
lou
let
just
watch
from
a
distance
it
was
not
possible
to
tell
exactly
what
the
old
lady
was
doing
so
far
as
the
girls
could
discern
she
was
tapping
the
inside
stones
of
the
well
with
a
hammer
she
trying
to
discover
if
any
of
them
are
loose
penny
whispered
excitedly
louise
i
sure
of
it
now
something
of
great
value
is
hidden
in
or
near
the
wishing
well
and
marborough
came
back
to
riverview
to
find
it
what
could
it
be
i
have
an
idea
if
there
something
hidden
in
or
around
the
well
why
does
she
have
a
workman
make
a
thorough
search
probably
because
she
does
want
folks
to
suspect
what
she
is
about
lou
that
may
explain
why
she
works
at
night
and
on
very
dark
gloomy
days
such
as
today
she
does
wish
to
be
seen
marborough
searches
in
such
obvious
places
louise
said
after
a
moment
if
anything
really
is
hidden
it
might
be
deep
down
in
the
well
she
never
will
find
it
in
that
case
we
might
help
her
penny
suggested
impulsively
you
know
she
would
resent
our
interference
she
probably
would
if
we
tell
her
what
we
intend
to
do
louise
gazed
speculatively
at
her
chum
realizing
that
penny
had
some
plan
in
mind
she
waited
expectantly
and
then
as
the
other
did
not
speak
inquired
just
what
scheme
are
you
hatching
now
you
gave
me
the
idea
yourself
penny
chuckled
the
logical
place
to
search
is
deep
down
inside
the
well
i
sure
the
water
ca
be
more
than
a
few
feet
deep
so
you
want
me
to
dive
in
and
drown
myself
louise
joked
thank
you
but
i
prefer
to
restrict
my
aquatic
exercise
to
swimming
pools
remember
that
silk
ladder
i
acquired
when
i
helped
police
capture
al
gepper
and
his
slippery
pals
penny
demanded
paying
no
heed
to
the
teasing
i
do
louise
nodded
it
was
made
of
braided
silk
strands
by
a
chinese
curio
man
and
had
two
iron
hooks
to
claw
into
the
wood
of
window
ledges
those
same
hooks
will
fit
very
nicely
over
the
side
of
the
wishing
well
i
been
waiting
for
a
chance
to
use
that
ladder
and
here
it
is
penny
you
actually
have
the
courage
to
climb
down
into
a
well
why
not
penny
laughed
but
it
must
be
tonight
while
my
enthusiasm
is
bubbling
meet
me
at
nine
and
bring
a
good
flashlight
louise
could
only
stare
you
actually
serious
indeed
i
am
penny
replied
gaily
everything
is
settled
now
slip
away
from
here
before
marborough
sees
us
chapter
the
night
dark
and
misty
was
entirely
suitable
for
the
purpose
to
which
the
two
girls
had
dedicated
it
dinner
over
penny
obtained
the
unique
silken
ladder
from
an
attic
trunk
compressing
it
into
a
small
she
sauntered
through
the
living
room
are
you
becoming
quite
studious
of
late
parker
inquired
noting
the
tucked
under
her
arm
off
to
the
library
again
over
to
louise
house
penny
corrected
vaguely
from
that
point
on
there
no
guarantee
you
be
home
early
i
hope
so
penny
answered
earnestly
if
for
any
reason
i
fail
to
appear
do
search
in
any
of
the
obvious
places
leaving
her
father
to
ponder
over
the
remark
she
hastily
quitted
the
house
a
clock
chimed
nine
as
she
reached
the
sidell
house
and
a
moment
later
her
chum
joined
her
in
the
yard
i
had
trouble
getting
away
louise
reported
mother
asked
a
thousand
questions
did
you
bring
the
flashlight
yes
here
it
is
my
but
it
a
dark
night
all
the
better
for
our
purpose
penny
said
cheerfully
a
single
light
burned
in
the
kitchen
window
of
the
marborough
house
as
the
girls
presently
approached
it
the
garden
was
shrouded
in
damp
wispy
mist
and
the
unkempt
grounds
never
had
appeared
more
desolate
penny
must
we
go
through
with
this
louise
asked
rapidly
losing
enthusiasm
for
the
venture
i
admit
the
idea
does
look
quite
as
attractive
as
it
did
this
afternoon
her
chum
replied
all
the
same
i
going
through
with
it
what
can
you
hope
to
find
down
in
that
well
penny
did
not
answer
walking
ahead
of
louise
she
noiselessly
crossed
the
yard
to
the
old
wishing
well
flashing
her
light
into
the
circular
interior
her
courage
nearly
failed
her
however
she
gave
no
indication
of
it
to
her
companion
better
be
careful
of
that
light
louise
warned
that
is
unless
you
want
marborough
to
come
out
and
catch
us
penny
switched
off
the
flashlight
and
thereafter
worked
in
darkness
taking
the
silken
ladder
from
its
case
she
fastened
the
two
iron
hooks
over
the
stone
ledge
next
she
lowered
the
ladder
into
the
well
listening
until
she
heard
a
faint
splash
in
the
water
below
now
you
stay
here
and
keep
watch
she
instructed
briskly
i
be
down
and
back
again
before
you
know
it
the
ladder
may
break
louise
said
pessimistically
seating
herself
on
the
stone
ledge
of
the
well
silk
deteriorates
with
age
and
those
braided
strands
never
did
look
strong
they
once
held
one
of
riverview
most
notorious
burglars
penny
returned
with
forced
cheerfulness
she
climbed
over
the
ledge
gazing
down
into
the
dark
well
it
safe
enough
i
hope
in
case
you
slip
and
fall
just
what
am
i
to
do
that
your
problem
penny
chuckled
now
hand
me
the
flashlight
on
my
way
despite
their
banter
both
girls
were
tense
and
worried
by
daylight
a
descent
into
the
well
had
seemed
to
penny
an
amusing
stunt
but
now
as
she
cautiously
descended
into
the
damp
circular
pit
she
felt
that
for
once
in
her
life
she
had
ventured
too
far
what
do
you
see
louise
called
softly
from
above
anything
reminded
of
the
work
before
her
penny
clung
with
one
hand
to
the
swaying
ladder
while
with
the
other
she
directed
the
flashlight
beam
about
the
circular
walls
the
sides
were
cracked
in
many
places
and
covered
with
a
slimy
green
moss
what
do
you
see
penny
louise
called
again
are
any
of
the
bricks
loose
not
that
i
can
discover
penny
answered
and
her
voice
echoed
weirdly
intrigued
by
the
sound
she
tried
an
experimental
yodel
why
it
just
like
a
cave
scene
on
the
radio
in
case
you
forgotten
you
in
a
well
louise
said
severely
furthermore
if
you
do
work
fast
marborough
will
come
out
here
i
have
to
have
a
little
relaxation
penny
grumbled
descending
deeper
into
the
well
she
resumed
her
task
of
examining
the
walls
there
were
no
loose
bricks
nothing
to
indicate
that
anything
ever
had
been
hidden
in
the
cavern
reaching
the
last
rung
without
realizing
it
she
stepped
not
into
space
but
water
surprisingly
her
foot
struck
a
solid
foundation
hastily
pulling
herself
back
on
the
ladder
penny
shouted
the
information
to
her
chum
lou
the
water
is
more
than
a
foot
and
a
half
deep
there
an
old
boot
or
something
of
the
sort
floating
around
you
do
catch
me
drinking
any
more
of
this
water
no
sir
there
was
no
reply
from
above
louise
penny
called
flashing
her
light
upward
quiet
came
the
whispered
response
i
think
someone
is
coming
mrs
marborough
penny
gasped
thoroughly
alarmed
no
two
men
they
turning
in
at
the
gate
penny
began
to
climb
the
silken
ladder
with
frantic
haste
you
never
can
get
out
without
them
seeing
you
louise
hissed
ducking
out
do
you
dare
they
see
me
if
i
do
stay
where
you
are
penny
and
i
come
back
after
they
go
oh
the
ladder
it
sure
to
give
you
away
in
the
emergency
penny
mind
worked
with
rapidity
lowering
herself
into
the
well
several
rungs
she
deliberately
stepped
into
the
water
to
her
relief
it
came
just
below
her
knees
quick
pull
up
the
ladder
she
instructed
the
two
men
were
so
close
that
louise
dared
not
obey
instead
she
loosed
the
iron
hooks
and
dropped
the
ladder
into
the
well
penny
barely
was
able
to
catch
it
and
prevent
a
loud
splash
of
all
the
tricks
she
muttered
but
louise
did
not
hear
she
had
fled
into
a
clump
of
bushes
penny
huddled
against
the
slimy
wall
listening
intently
thinking
that
she
heard
footsteps
she
switched
out
the
flashlight
this
is
the
place
all
right
a
masculine
voice
said
wonder
if
the
old
lady
is
at
home
there
a
light
showing
the
voices
faded
away
and
penny
drew
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
impatiently
she
waited
for
louise
to
come
to
her
aid
after
several
minutes
she
realized
why
her
chum
delayed
for
she
again
heard
voices
the
old
lady
must
be
inside
the
house
funny
she
would
come
to
the
door
they
say
she
a
queer
one
though
to
penny
discomfort
the
two
men
paused
by
the
wishing
well
want
a
drink
she
heard
one
ask
the
voices
seemed
faintly
familiar
to
penny
and
suddenly
it
dawned
upon
her
that
the
two
men
were
coaten
and
his
texas
friend
however
she
could
think
of
no
reason
why
they
should
call
upon
marborough
her
reflection
came
to
an
abrupt
end
as
the
well
bucket
splashed
into
the
water
beside
her
suppressing
a
giggle
she
groped
for
the
old
boot
which
floated
nearby
dropping
it
into
the
bucket
she
watched
as
it
was
raised
to
the
surface
a
moment
later
she
heard
an
exclamation
of
wrath
from
above
see
what
i
drawn
up
one
of
the
men
muttered
these
old
wells
must
be
filled
with
filth
penny
hoped
that
the
strangers
would
immediately
depart
but
instead
they
loitered
by
the
well
talking
we
been
wasting
entirely
too
much
time
in
this
remarked
the
man
whom
she
took
to
be
coaten
suppose
we
were
to
offer
ted
a
hundred
dollars
to
sign
the
paper
would
he
do
it
i
think
he
might
but
the
girl
is
the
one
who
make
trouble
shrewd
we
get
around
her
somehow
the
other
said
gruffly
this
thing
drag
on
forever
i
have
work
waiting
for
me
in
texas
the
voices
gradually
died
away
and
penny
heard
no
more
however
from
the
snatch
of
conversation
she
was
convinced
that
rhoda
suspicions
regarding
the
texas
strangers
had
been
well
founded
but
what
had
brought
the
two
men
to
riverview
if
rhoda
or
ted
own
property
i
could
understand
why
it
would
be
desirable
to
adopt
them
she
thought
as
it
is
the
thing
does
make
sense
to
keep
from
freezing
penny
gingerly
waded
around
and
around
in
the
well
it
seemed
ages
before
louise
thrust
her
head
over
the
ledge
and
called
softly
are
you
still
there
pet
i
frozen
into
one
big
icicle
penny
retorted
get
me
out
of
here
instructing
her
chum
to
lower
the
bucket
penny
fastened
the
silken
ladder
to
the
handle
louise
hauled
it
up
and
again
hooked
the
irons
to
the
ledge
of
the
well
stiffly
penny
climbed
toward
the
surface
she
had
nearly
reached
the
top
when
the
beam
of
light
chanced
to
play
across
a
section
of
brick
which
hitherto
had
escaped
her
notice
halting
she
traced
with
her
finger
a
rectangular
pattern
on
the
wall
that
not
an
ordinary
crack
she
thought
it
might
be
an
old
opening
which
has
been
bricked
up
are
you
coming
louise
called
impatiently
i
am
said
penny
emerging
from
the
well
and
do
you
dare
say
that
this
night
has
been
a
failure
i
just
made
a
most
astounding
discovery
chapter
penny
startling
appearance
rather
than
her
words
made
the
deepest
impression
upon
louise
the
girl
shoes
and
stockings
were
wet
her
clothing
was
smeared
with
green
slime
and
strings
of
moss
clung
to
her
hair
you
look
like
father
neptune
emerging
from
the
briny
deep
she
chuckled
i
freezing
to
death
penny
chattered
come
on
we
going
home
louise
hauled
up
the
silken
ladder
from
the
well
squeezing
out
the
water
she
compressed
it
into
the
carrying
case
what
were
you
saying
about
a
discovery
she
inquired
belatedly
oh
nothing
of
consequence
penny
answered
pounding
her
hands
together
to
restore
circulation
merely
an
opening
in
the
side
of
the
well
it
probably
leads
into
a
tunnel
penny
are
you
sure
i
not
sure
of
anything
except
that
i
going
home
penny
replied
crossly
she
started
across
the
lawn
with
her
chum
hurrying
after
her
oh
penny
i
terribly
sorry
louise
said
contritely
i
know
you
had
an
awful
time
down
in
the
well
but
it
was
my
fault
those
two
men
arrived
just
when
they
did
who
were
they
penny
asked
mollified
by
the
apology
from
their
voices
i
took
them
to
be
coaten
and
his
friend
that
who
they
were
but
i
ca
imagine
why
they
came
to
see
marborough
anyway
they
did
get
into
the
house
lou
i
heard
those
men
talking
while
i
was
down
in
the
well
penny
revealed
i
sure
they
dishonest
they
want
ted
and
rhoda
to
sign
something
over
to
them
but
rhoda
said
she
and
her
brother
have
no
property
i
know
penny
frowned
i
ca
make
head
nor
tail
of
the
situation
i
too
miserable
to
think
about
anything
now
pausing
beside
a
tree
she
removed
one
of
her
shoes
after
pouring
a
little
water
from
it
she
replaced
it
and
went
through
a
similar
procedure
with
the
other
shoe
please
tell
me
what
else
you
learned
while
in
the
well
louise
pleaded
have
i
been
punished
enough
her
good
humor
restored
penny
grinned
amiably
to
tell
you
the
truth
lou
i
not
sure
whether
i
found
anything
or
not
but
you
said
i
know
just
as
i
reached
the
top
of
the
well
i
noticed
a
section
of
brick
wall
which
seemed
to
be
cracked
in
the
exact
shape
of
a
rectangle
was
that
all
louise
asked
in
disappointment
i
did
even
take
time
to
examine
the
place
i
felt
so
disgusted
penny
resumed
however
i
believe
that
if
one
were
able
to
remove
those
loose
bricks
an
opening
might
be
found
behind
them
where
something
may
be
hidden
it
possible
how
could
one
remove
the
bricks
without
hiring
a
workman
louise
asked
after
a
moment
if
they
are
as
loose
as
i
think
they
are
i
might
be
able
to
get
them
out
myself
not
tonight
though
penny
felt
in
no
mood
to
discuss
future
possibilities
or
even
to
consider
them
already
cold
the
misty
air
added
to
her
physical
discomfort
better
get
a
hot
shower
and
go
to
bed
louise
advised
as
they
finally
reached
the
parker
home
we
talk
things
over
in
the
morning
not
desiring
to
attract
attention
to
herself
penny
entered
the
house
by
a
side
door
to
her
discomfiture
weems
who
chanced
to
be
getting
a
drink
in
the
kitchen
saw
the
disheveled
clothing
why
penny
parker
she
exclaimed
what
have
you
done
to
yourself
nothing
penny
mumbled
i
just
a
little
wet
i
been
down
in
a
well
there
are
times
when
your
jokes
do
seem
at
all
funny
the
housekeeper
said
sternly
how
did
you
ruin
your
clothes
that
the
truth
weems
i
was
down
in
a
well
and
i
stepped
off
into
the
water
penny
you
ca
expect
me
to
believe
such
a
tall
story
now
tell
me
exactly
what
happen
would
it
seem
more
reasonable
if
i
said
that
i
stumbled
and
fell
into
a
ditch
i
rather
thought
something
of
the
sort
happened
weems
declared
how
did
the
accident
occur
it
did
penny
maintained
plaintively
escaping
upstairs
before
the
housekeeper
could
question
her
further
she
took
a
hot
shower
and
went
to
bed
she
could
hear
a
murmur
of
voices
in
the
living
room
below
and
knew
that
weems
was
discussing
her
behavior
with
her
father
sometimes
grownups
are
so
unreasonable
she
sighed
snuggling
into
the
covers
you
tell
them
the
truth
and
what
they
really
want
is
a
nice
logical
whopper
penny
slept
soundly
and
did
not
awaken
until
the
sunday
morning
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
sitting
up
in
bed
she
moved
her
arms
experimentally
they
were
very
sore
and
stiff
she
swung
her
feet
to
the
floor
and
groaned
with
pain
guess
i
ca
take
it
any
more
she
muttered
i
must
be
getting
soft
or
else
it
old
age
sneaking
up
on
me
torturing
herself
with
a
limbering
exercise
penny
dressed
and
went
downstairs
weems
had
gone
to
church
while
parker
had
submerged
himself
in
pages
of
sunday
paper
detouring
around
the
living
room
penny
went
to
the
kitchen
to
prepare
herself
a
belated
breakfast
she
was
picking
at
the
nuts
of
a
fruit
salad
found
in
the
ice
box
when
her
father
appeared
in
the
doorway
penny
he
began
sternly
where
was
i
last
night
she
interrupted
i
said
before
and
now
repeat
in
a
well
a
nice
deep
one
with
water
in
it
when
you
ready
to
tell
me
the
real
story
i
shall
listen
parker
said
quietly
until
that
time
i
must
deprive
you
of
your
weekly
allowance
oh
dad
penny
wailed
you
know
i
stony
broke
i
wo
be
able
to
drive
my
car
or
even
buy
a
hot
dog
that
is
your
misfortune
weems
says
i
have
been
entirely
too
indulgent
with
you
and
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
her
i
seldom
checked
your
comings
or
goings
but
in
the
future
i
shall
expect
you
to
tell
me
your
plans
when
you
leave
the
house
at
night
having
delivered
his
ultimatum
parker
quietly
withdrew
penny
had
lost
her
appetite
for
breakfast
feeling
much
abused
she
banged
out
the
kitchen
door
into
the
yard
her
first
act
was
to
inspect
the
gasoline
tanks
of
both
leaping
lena
and
the
maroon
car
as
she
had
feared
the
combined
fuel
supply
did
not
equal
three
gallons
there
just
about
miles
between
me
and
misery
she
reflected
grimly
i
would
dare
siphon
gas
out
of
dad
car
or
ask
for
credit
at
a
filling
station
either
wandering
around
to
the
front
porch
she
sat
down
on
the
steps
one
of
her
high
school
boy
friends
pedalled
past
on
his
bicycle
calling
a
cheery
greeting
penny
barely
responded
presently
a
milk
wagon
clattered
to
a
stop
in
front
of
the
house
the
driver
came
up
the
walk
with
his
rack
of
milk
bottles
penny
eyed
him
speculatively
we
have
a
lot
of
old
bottles
in
the
basement
she
greeted
him
does
your
company
pay
for
them
sorry
he
declined
we
use
only
our
own
stamped
bottles
there
no
deposit
charge
customers
are
expected
to
return
them
without
rebate
the
driver
left
a
quart
of
milk
on
the
back
doorstep
of
the
parker
home
in
walking
to
his
wagon
he
paused
beside
penny
remarking
maybe
you
could
sell
your
old
bottles
to
a
dealer
i
saw
one
on
the
next
street
about
five
minutes
ago
where
penny
demanded
jumping
to
her
feet
he
was
on
fulton
avenue
when
i
drove
past
thanking
the
driver
penny
ran
as
fast
as
her
stiff
limbs
would
permit
to
the
next
street
corner
far
up
the
avenue
she
saw
a
battered
old
car
of
the
man
hurrying
on
she
reached
the
automobile
just
as
its
owner
came
from
a
house
carrying
an
armful
of
corded
newspapers
excuse
me
she
called
eagerly
do
you
buy
old
bottles
the
man
turned
toward
her
doffing
his
derby
hat
good
morning
miss
he
said
i
buy
newspapers
old
furniture
rubber
tires
copper
brass
or
gold
but
not
bottles
penny
scarcely
heard
the
discouraging
information
for
she
was
staring
at
the
man
as
if
his
appearance
fascinated
her
for
a
moment
she
could
not
think
where
she
had
seen
him
before
and
then
suddenly
she
remembered
why
i
saw
you
at
marborough
place
she
exclaimed
you
the
one
person
who
has
been
inside
the
house
i
want
you
to
tell
me
all
about
it
chapter
the
butterworth
the
dealer
scarcely
knew
what
to
make
of
penny
abrupt
request
tell
me
how
the
house
looks
inside
she
requested
as
he
remained
mute
is
it
as
handsome
as
folks
say
you
are
a
friend
of
mrs
marborough
the
man
inquired
cocking
his
head
sideways
as
he
regarded
the
girl
of
course
then
why
do
you
not
ask
marborough
that
question
because
she
never
invites
anyone
into
her
house
penny
explained
patiently
you
the
only
person
to
get
in
so
far
as
i
know
venture
she
sold
you
something
am
i
right
maybe
so
butterworth
grinned
my
lips
they
are
sealed
sealed
i
promise
marborough
i
tell
nothing
of
what
i
see
in
the
house
then
there
is
something
mysterious
going
on
there
penny
exclaimed
tell
me
why
did
you
go
to
the
house
marborough
sent
for
me
but
why
penny
demanded
exasperated
because
she
could
learn
nothing
of
importance
did
marborough
sell
you
something
maybe
so
maybe
not
the
man
answered
climbing
into
his
overloaded
car
you
ask
her
penny
watched
him
drive
away
and
then
returned
to
her
own
doorstep
she
was
listlessly
throwing
acorns
at
a
squirrel
when
louise
sidell
came
down
the
street
dressed
in
her
sunday
best
what
the
matter
penny
she
inquired
roving
over
to
the
porch
how
do
you
feel
this
morning
lower
than
the
center
of
the
earth
i
lost
my
reputation
with
dad
my
allowance
and
my
initiative
if
i
had
a
nickel
i
go
drown
myself
in
a
coke
what
you
need
is
a
nice
adventure
louise
said
mischievously
how
about
a
trip
out
to
marborough
tomorrow
night
i
had
enough
of
wells
penny
you
do
mean
it
louise
grinned
after
discovering
those
loose
bricks
you
just
forget
about
them
why
not
penny
demanded
wildly
dad

double
punishment

louise
declared
with
confidence

tomorrow
night
about

penny
said
gloomily
throughout
the
day
she
tried
to
win
favor
with
both
weems
and
her
father
by
doing
small
things
to
please
them
when
the
housekeeper
came
home
from
church
dinner
awaited
her
penny
insisted
upon
doing
the
dishes
she
straightened
the
kitchen
she
brought
her
father
his
bedroom
slippers
and
refrained
from
turning
on
the
radio
while
he
was
reading
the
schedule
was
a
trying
one
for
her
but
she
kept
it
up
faithfully
all
day
sunday
and
until
after
dinner
on
monday
then
came
the
denouement
upon
which
she
pinned
her
hopes
dad
she
said
demurely
leaning
on
the
chair
arm
and
stroking
his
hair
with
your
kind
permission
i
should
like
to
absent
myself
from
the
house
for
a
few
minutes
where
do
you
plan
to
go
he
asked
trying
to
act
stern
penny
was
prepared
for
the
question
from
her
pocket
she
whisked
a
lengthy
typewritten
paper
handsomely
decorated
with
a
diagram
what
this
parker
asked
his
lips
twitching
slightly
merely
a
report
on
my
proposed
movements
for
the
next
hour
at
i
hope
to
be
at
louise
house
eight
should
find
me
on
adams
street
moving
southward
at
eight
i
pass
gulbert
park
never
mind
parker
interrupted
i
see
by
this
lengthy
document
that
your
ultimate
destination
is
marborough
estate
is
it
rather
late
to
pay
a
social
call
what
does
this
x
on
the
map
represent
the
publisher
asked
his
interest
shifting
oh
that
smiled
penny
merely
one
of
the
fixtures
in
yard
louise
and
i
think
treasure
may
be
hidden
there
amused
by
what
he
took
to
be
his
daughter
whimsy
parker
returned
the
diagram
to
her
do
i
have
your
permission
to
leave
the
house
she
asked
anxiously
yes
you
may
go
he
agreed
but
mind
no
late
hours
and
no
more
tall
tales
about
falling
into
wells
louise
was
waiting
for
penny
in
the
sidell
yard
and
the
girls
went
as
quickly
as
they
could
to
the
marborough
estate
the
house
was
completely
dark
leading
them
to
believe
that
the
widow
might
have
absented
herself
for
the
evening
we
have
to
be
especially
careful
louise
warned
as
they
approached
the
old
wishing
well
she
might
return
at
any
moment
and
find
us
penny
had
brought
the
silken
ladder
extra
rope
a
flashlight
and
a
suit
of
warm
coveralls
which
her
father
used
when
he
worked
on
the
car
donning
the
bulky
garment
she
prepared
to
descend
a
few
feet
into
the
well
do
be
careful
louise
said
anxiously
if
you
should
fall
you
might
kill
yourself
you
think
of
the
most
cheerful
things
penny
muttered
climbing
nimbly
down
the
swaying
ladder
i
not
taking
any
chances
though
i
tie
myself
to
the
ladder
with
this
extra
piece
of
rope
after
she
had
gained
the
position
she
desired
louise
handed
down
the
flashlight
penny
carefully
inspected
the
brick
wall
i
believe
it
is
an
opening
she
reported
jubilantly
i
really
do
here
take
this
flash
i
ca
work
and
hold
it
while
louise
directed
the
beam
from
above
penny
tugged
at
the
bricks
unable
to
move
them
she
called
for
a
tool
which
she
had
brought
with
her
by
means
of
it
she
easily
pried
one
of
the
bricks
loose
pushing
her
arm
through
the
opening
she
encountered
only
empty
space
it
a
little
tunnel
i
think
she
shouted
to
louise
take
this
brick
and
i
try
to
pry
out
others
within
ten
minutes
penny
had
handed
up
enough
of
them
to
make
a
large
pile
beside
the
flagstones
do
you
realize
you
practically
destroying
marborough
well
louise
said
uneasily
how
will
we
ever
explain
this
i
can
put
the
bricks
back
again
penny
assured
her
they
were
meant
to
come
out
now
the
flashlight
again
balancing
herself
precariously
on
the
ladder
she
directed
the
light
through
the
opening
she
had
created
a
long
narrow
tunnel
which
she
judged
to
be
about
five
feet
below
the
ground
extended
as
far
as
she
could
see
i
going
to
try
to
get
in
there
she
called
to
louise
toss
me
a
life
preserver
if
i
fail
calculating
the
space
penny
swung
her
feet
from
the
ladder
to
the
ledge
retaining
an
arm
hold
on
the
ropes
she
edged
herself
backwards
into
the
hole
it
much
easier
than
it
looks
she
called
encouragingly
to
her
chum
come
on
if
you
want
to
explore
louise
hesitated
and
then
daringly
climbed
down
into
the
well
penny
helped
her
from
the
ladder
into
the
tunnel
where
do
you
suppose
this
leads
louise
gasped
maybe
to
the
house
penny
speculated
i
know
lots
of
these
old
places
had
escapes
made
so
that
in
time
of
war
or
indian
attacks
the
householders
could
get
away
never
heard
of
a
tunnel
opening
into
a
well
though
the
bricked
passageway
was
so
low
that
for
the
first
twelve
feet
the
girls
were
forced
to
crawl
on
hands
and
knees
gradually
the
tunnel
deepened
until
they
were
able
to
walk
in
a
stooped
position
we
coming
to
the
end
of
it
penny
presently
announced
directly
in
front
of
her
was
a
heavy
door
which
showed
the
effects
of
age
it
did
not
move
easily
but
together
the
girls
were
able
to
swing
it
open
where
in
the
world
are
we
louise
murmured
in
perplexity
penny
flashed
her
light
directly
ahead
a
series
of
four
steps
led
down
from
the
tunnel
into
an
empty
room
which
barely
was
six
feet
across
so
far
as
she
could
see
it
had
no
exit
it
looks
as
if
we
at
the
end
of
the
trail
louise
remarked
in
disappointment
this
must
be
part
of
the
marborough
house
penny
declared
descending
the
steps
into
the
tiny
room
but
there
no
way
out
of
it
except
through
the
tunnel
there
must
be
if
we
can
find
it
penny
insisted
wandering
about
the
room
she
began
to
explore
the
walls
and
louise
followed
her
example
their
search
was
rewarded
for
presently
they
discovered
a
small
brass
knob
embedded
in
the
rough
board
paneling
penny
pulled
on
it
and
a
section
of
wall
slid
back
now
we
really
in
the
marborough
house
she
whispered
excitedly
the
basement
i
think
stepping
through
the
opening
the
girls
made
no
sound
as
they
tiptoed
around
in
the
dark
damp
room
penny
flashlight
revealed
that
the
walls
had
been
boarded
over
but
there
was
no
solid
foundation
beneath
their
feet
only
a
hard
dirt
floor
a
steep
stairway
led
up
from
the
basement
do
you
suppose
marborough
is
here
penny
whispered
listening
there
was
no
sound
from
above
shall
we
go
upstairs
or
back
the
way
we
came
she
asked
her
chum
let
risk
being
caught
louise
decided
after
a
moment
hesitation
i
rather
be
sent
to
jail
for
house
breaking
than
to
climb
into
that
well
again
huddling
together
the
girls
crept
up
the
stairway
the
landing
was
blocked
by
another
door
penny
tested
it
and
finding
it
unlocked
pushed
it
gently
open
again
they
listened
the
coast
is
clear
louise
whispered
i
sure
marborough
here
penny
stepped
across
the
threshold
tense
with
anticipation
ever
since
marborough
arrival
in
riverview
she
had
longed
to
see
the
interior
of
the
grand
old
mansion
and
now
through
a
strange
quirk
of
adventure
her
ambition
was
to
be
gratified
slowly
she
allowed
the
flashlight
beam
to
play
over
the
walls
of
the
room
there
were
several
pictures
in
massive
gold
frames
leading
her
to
think
that
she
had
entered
a
library
or
living
room
systematically
she
continued
to
move
the
light
about
in
search
of
furniture
so
far
as
she
could
see
there
was
none
the
room
is
empty
louise
whispered
at
her
elbow
a
board
squeaked
beneath
their
weight
as
the
girls
tiptoed
to
a
doorway
opening
into
a
still
larger
room
this
must
be
the
living
room
penny
decided
observing
a
beautiful
circular
stairway
which
rose
to
the
second
floor
but
where
is
the
furniture
demanded
louise
in
bewilderment
penny
light
cut
squares
across
the
room
but
the
only
objects
revealed
were
a
chair
and
a
table
drawn
close
to
the
fireplace
what
can
this
mean
louise
gasped
the
house
always
has
been
furnished
now
everything
is
gone
penny
did
not
answer
the
sound
of
shuffling
feet
on
the
front
porch
caused
both
girls
to
freeze
against
the
wall
before
they
could
retreat
to
the
basement
stairs
the
living
room
door
opened
light
from
a
street
lamp
cut
a
path
across
the
bare
floor
marborough
stood
framed
in
the
doorway
the
girls
had
made
no
sound
yet
the
mistress
of
rose
acres
seemed
to
sense
that
she
was
not
alone
who
is
it
she
called
sharply
speak
up
who
is
hiding
here
chapter
marborough
in
frightened
voices
penny
and
louise
acknowledged
their
presence
in
the
dark
room
greatly
relieved
that
the
intruders
were
girls
marborough
struck
a
match
and
lighted
three
candles
which
were
set
in
a
huge
glass
candelabra
oh
so
it
you
she
exclaimed
as
the
flickering
light
fell
upon
their
faces
may
i
ask
why
you
have
broken
into
my
house
we
thoroughly
ashamed
of
ourselves
marborough
penny
said
apologetically
indeed
we
are
added
louise
when
we
started
to
investigate
the
wishing
well
we
did
intend
to
enter
the
house
suppose
you
explain
suggested
the
mistress
of
rose
acres
it
a
long
story
sighed
penny
may
we
sit
down
somewhere
the
request
embarrassed
marborough
she
hesitated
and
then
indicated
that
the
girls
were
to
follow
her
to
their
surprise
she
led
them
through
another
empty
room
to
the
kitchen
there
lighting
a
candle
its
soft
illumination
revealed
an
old
oil
stove
several
chairs
a
porcelain
table
and
a
cot
which
obviously
served
both
as
a
day
couch
and
bed
marborough
offered
no
explanation
or
apology
taking
wood
from
a
box
she
piled
it
into
the
fireplace
and
soon
had
a
cheerful
blaze
on
the
hearth
drawing
their
chairs
to
the
fire
penny
and
louise
explained
how
they
had
entered
the
old
mansion
marborough
listened
attentively
to
their
story
but
did
not
appear
especially
surprised
i
always
known
about
that
old
tunnel
she
said
when
they
had
finished
it
was
built
by
the
first
owner
of
this
house
many
many
years
ago
and
i
doubt
if
it
ever
was
used
i
tried
to
find
the
entrance
from
the
basement
a
few
days
ago
but
was
unable
to
locate
it
we
saw
you
with
your
lantern
at
the
wishing
well
louise
confessed
that
was
what
aroused
our
curiosity
i
was
looking
for
the
other
tunnel
entrance
i
found
it
without
much
trouble
but
it
was
so
deep
down
in
the
well
that
i
dared
not
risk
trying
to
get
into
it
although
i
considered
hiring
a
man
i
hesitated
because
i
knew
it
would
cause
talk
penny
and
louise
were
feeling
much
more
at
ease
sensing
that
the
mistress
of
rose
acres
no
longer
was
irritated
by
their
actions
eagerly
they
waited
for
her
to
reveal
more
i
suppose
you
think
me
a
queer
old
lady
marborough
resumed
perhaps
i
am
but
i
have
a
very
good
reason
for
some
of
the
things
i
do
i
came
to
riverview
to
search
for
something
which
has
been
lost
many
years
something
hidden
during
the
civil
war
inquired
louise
breathlessly
no
my
dear
an
object
secreted
by
my
sister
virginia
since
you
girls
already
have
learned
so
much
i
will
tell
you
all
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
the
marborough
pearls
penny
and
louise
shook
their
heads
i
forget
that
you
are
so
very
young
marborough
said
your
mothers
would
remember
at
any
rate
the
necklace
was
handed
down
in
our
family
for
many
generations
always
to
the
daughter
who
was
the
first
to
marry
virginia
my
younger
sister
dreamed
and
hoped
that
the
pearls
would
go
to
her
naturally
i
shared
a
similar
desire
as
it
came
about
i
was
the
first
of
the
family
to
marry
then
you
received
the
necklace
louise
commented
it
should
have
gone
to
me
but
my
sister
was
determined
i
never
should
win
such
a
victory
over
her
in
a
fit
of
anger
she
hid
the
pearls
father
tried
to
force
her
to
tell
what
she
had
done
with
them
but
she
was
very
headstrong
she
ran
away
from
home
married
a
scamp
and
sailed
with
him
to
south
america
she
died
there
less
than
two
years
after
my
own
marriage
what
became
of
the
pearls
penny
asked
eagerly
our
family
believed
that
she
took
the
necklace
with
her
for
many
years
we
assumed
that
virginia
worthless
husband
had
obtained
possession
of
it
he
denied
any
knowledge
of
the
pearls
but
we
never
accepted
his
story
as
true
then
a
few
weeks
ago
a
letter
came
from
south
america
it
had
been
written
by
virginia
husband
shortly
before
his
death
he
confessed
to
the
theft
of
the
necklace
louise
asked
trying
to
speed
the
story
no
indeed
he
merely
enclosed
a
letter
written
by
virginia
years
before
it
was
addressed
to
me
and
had
never
been
sent
because
her
husband
deliberately
withheld
it
just
selfish
and
cantankerous
that
man
was
the
letter
told
where
the
pearls
had
been
hidden
i
imagine
that
virginia
husband
had
planned
to
gain
possession
of
them
someday
but
fate
defeated
him
so
on
his
death
bed
he
sent
me
the
original
letter
which
i
should
have
received
forty
years
earlier
where
were
the
pearls
hidden
penny
questioned
her
eyes
sparkling
with
anticipation
you
have
found
them
yet
no
and
i
doubt
that
i
ever
shall
marborough
sighed
letter
was
not
very
definite
she
begged
my
forgiveness
for
having
caused
so
much
trouble
and
said
that
she
had
hidden
the
necklace
near
the
old
wishing
well
did
she
tell
you
where
louise
asked
in
disappointment
there
were
several
words
which
had
been
blotted
with
ink
i
suspect
virginia
husband
did
it
to
prevent
anyone
but
himself
from
learning
the
hiding
place
then
when
he
finally
sent
the
letter
to
me
he
may
have
forgotten
what
he
had
done
that
only
my
guess
of
course
as
the
letter
reads
my
only
clue
is
that
the
pearls
were
hidden
near
the
wishing
well
that
explains
why
you
were
removing
the
flagstones
the
other
night
louise
remarked
yes
i
searched
everywhere
i
can
think
of
except
in
the
old
tunnel
when
you
girls
went
through
it
tonight
did
you
notice
anything
unusual
no
hiding
place
penny
replied
of
course
we
were
looking
for
anything
of
the
sort
if
we
could
explore
the
passageway
by
daylight
ca
we
help
you
find
the
pearls
mrs
marborough
louise
interrupted
it
would
be
such
fun
searching
for
them
i
be
very
happy
to
have
your
help
the
old
lady
said
smiling
upon
one
condition
you
must
tell
no
one
already
i
am
the
laughing
stock
of
riverview
and
if
this
latest
story
should
get
around
everyone
would
talk
penny
and
louise
promptly
assured
her
that
they
would
tell
no
one
about
the
pearls
another
thing
marborough
hesitated
and
then
went
on
i
suppose
you
understand
now
why
i
never
invited
you
into
the
house
it
was
that
i
meant
to
be
inhospitable
because
the
place
is
fixed
up
louise
came
to
her
aid
why
penny
and
i
would
have
thought
nothing
of
it
this
is
a
cozy
kitchen
with
a
cheerful
fire
i
think
it
nice
i
probably
sha
be
here
long
my
purpose
in
returning
to
riverview
was
to
find
the
pearls
i
nearly
made
up
my
mind
that
they
are
lost
forever
oh
do
say
that
penny
cried
tomorrow
with
your
permission
louise
and
i
will
explore
the
tunnel
we
may
have
luck
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
have
your
help
my
dear
again
marborough
groped
for
words
and
finished
awkwardly
please
i
beg
of
you
tell
anyone
what
you
have
seen
tonight
particularly
the
barren
state
of
this
house
we
understand
penny
said
gravely
the
fire
had
burned
low
mindful
that
they
must
be
home
early
the
girls
bade
marborough
goodbye
promising
to
return
the
following
day
once
outside
the
mansion
they
paused
beside
a
tree
so
that
penny
might
remove
the
heavy
coveralls
which
she
still
wore
over
her
frock
what
a
night
she
murmured
happily
for
once
penny
one
of
your
crazy
adventures
turned
out
beautifully
louise
praised
we
have
a
wonderful
time
searching
for
that
necklace
she
certainly
queer
though
mrs
marborough
yes
imagine
being
so
sensitive
about
how
the
interior
of
her
house
looks
who
would
expect
it
to
be
fixed
up
nicely
after
standing
empty
so
many
years
are
you
forgetting
something
penny
asked
she
hopped
grotesquely
on
one
foot
as
she
extricated
the
other
from
the
coveralls
forgetting
what
louise
demanded
puzzled
remember
that
first
day
we
peeped
into
the
house
through
the
window
why
yes
what
about
it
your
memory
is
very
good
louise
do
you
remember
the
furniture
we
saw
that
right
i
had
forgotten
what
became
of
it
if
i
had
just
one
guess
i
say
mr
butterworth
who
is
he
penny
a
dealer
who
buys
old
furniture
newspapers
rubber
tires
everything
except
bottles
not
that
funny
looking
man
we
saw
enter
this
house
the
other
day
the
same
louise
it
my
guess
that
marborough
sold
all
of
her
valuable
antiques
probably
for
a
fraction
of
their
true
worth
how
foolish
of
her
why
would
she
do
that
do
you
understand
penny
asked
patiently
there
can
be
but
one
explanation
marborough
is
wealthy
any
more
she
living
in
dire
poverty
and
trying
to
keep
people
from
learning
the
truth
chapter
the
realization
that
in
all
likelihood
marborough
had
sold
her
valuable
antiques
to
the
dealer
was
disconcerting
to
louise
as
well
as
penny
they
did
not
believe
that
butterworth
would
pay
a
fractional
part
of
the
furniture
true
value
and
apparently
the
only
reason
for
parting
with
her
treasures
was
an
urgent
need
for
money
of
course
i
may
have
guessed
wrong
about
it
penny
admitted
as
she
and
louise
started
toward
home
just
to
check
up
i
call
at
butterworth
shop
tomorrow
and
see
what
i
can
learn
i
wish
we
dared
tell
someone
about
the
condition
of
the
house
louise
said
thoughtfully
why
if
marborough
is
in
need
mother
would
help
so
would
weems
added
penny
but
we
gave
our
promise
not
to
reveal
anything
we
saw
for
the
our
hands
are
tied
the
events
of
the
night
had
made
the
girls
eager
to
return
again
to
rose
acres
to
search
for
the
missing
pearl
necklace
they
agreed
that
immediately
after
school
the
next
afternoon
they
would
call
upon
butterworth
and
then
keep
their
appointment
with
the
widow
remember
we
must
tell
anyone
what
we
have
learned
penny
warned
as
she
parted
company
with
her
chum
not
even
rhoda
throughout
the
following
day
both
girls
were
so
excited
that
they
found
it
all
but
impossible
to
study
when
the
closing
bell
finally
brought
release
they
bolted
from
the
school
building
before
any
of
their
classmates
could
detain
them
i
have
the
address
of
butterworth
shop
penny
said
consulting
a
paper
it
not
far
from
here
the
building
proved
to
be
a
typical
store
with
old
tables
and
chairs
piled
in
the
windows
along
with
cut
glass
and
entering
the
girls
wandered
about
until
a
woman
asked
them
if
they
were
searching
for
anything
in
particular
we
interested
in
furniture
penny
explained
old
pieces
antiques
if
we
can
find
them
come
into
the
back
room
the
woman
invited
butterworth
bought
a
number
of
pieces
just
a
few
days
ago
from
one
of
riverview
best
homes
too
where
was
that
inquired
louise
i
did
hear
him
mention
the
name
it
was
from
a
house
that
has
been
closed
many
years
the
owner
returned
only
a
short
time
ago
and
is
closing
out
everything
the
girls
did
not
doubt
that
the
furniture
under
discussion
had
been
obtained
from
rose
acres
they
were
certain
of
it
as
they
viewed
rosewood
and
mahogany
chairs
imported
mirrors
porcelain
ornaments
massive
beds
sofas
with
damaged
coverings
and
handsome
chests
and
bureaus
penny
ventured
to
price
a
few
of
the
items
the
amount
asked
was
so
low
that
she
knew
butterworth
had
paid
an
extremely
small
sum
to
the
widow
making
an
excuse
for
not
purchasing
she
and
louise
escaped
to
the
street
there
no
question
about
it
penny
declared
as
they
set
off
for
rose
acres
marborough
sold
her
beautiful
things
to
mr
butterworth
he
ca
appreciate
their
value
or
he
never
would
offer
them
at
such
low
prices
louise
added
anyone
who
buys
those
things
will
obtain
wonderful
bargains
penny
nodded
soberly
lost
in
thought
she
had
little
to
say
until
the
girls
drew
near
rose
acres
do
let
on
to
marborough
that
we
learned
about
the
furniture
she
warned
it
really
none
of
our
affair
if
she
sells
her
belongings
the
widow
had
been
expecting
the
girls
and
had
everything
in
readiness
to
explore
the
tunnel
while
they
searched
it
from
end
to
end
she
waited
hopefully
at
the
wishing
well
have
you
found
anything
she
called
several
times
not
yet
penny
would
reply
patiently
she
and
louise
laboriously
examined
every
inch
of
the
bricked
passageway
but
with
fading
hope
the
walls
were
firm
giving
no
indication
that
anything
ever
had
been
hidden
behind
or
within
them
to
have
excavated
the
dirt
flooring
was
a
task
not
to
be
considered
at
the
moment
there
nothing
here
penny
whispered
to
her
chum
i
doubt
that
the
pearls
ever
were
hidden
in
this
tunnel
marborough
will
be
terribly
disappointed
louise
replied
in
an
undertone
what
shall
we
tell
her
we
can
pretend
to
keep
on
searching
maybe
if
we
prowl
about
this
place
for
a
few
days
we
have
luck
the
pearls
were
hidden
near
the
wishing
well
we
have
that
much
to
go
on
they
may
have
disappeared
years
ago
penny
contributed
pessimistically
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
feel
very
hopeful
about
ever
finding
them
leaving
the
tunnel
by
means
of
the
easier
exit
the
girls
emerged
into
the
basement
they
were
preparing
to
climb
the
stairs
to
the
first
floor
when
marborough
voice
reached
their
ears
almost
as
plainly
as
if
she
were
in
the
cellar
louise
penny
are
you
all
right
startled
by
the
clearness
of
the
call
the
girls
paused
on
the
stairway
why
her
voice
came
through
as
plainly
as
if
she
were
in
this
room
louise
exclaimed
you
do
suppose
marborough
has
ventured
into
the
passageway
thoroughly
alarmed
the
girls
raced
up
the
stairway
and
out
of
the
house
into
the
yard
to
their
relief
they
saw
marborough
standing
by
the
wishing
well
peering
anxiously
down
oh
here
you
are
she
murmured
as
they
ran
up
i
was
beginning
to
get
worried
the
last
time
i
called
you
did
not
answer
we
were
down
in
the
basement
penny
explained
marborough
your
voice
came
through
to
us
as
plainly
as
if
you
were
in
the
passage
the
disclosure
did
not
seem
to
surprise
the
widow
for
she
smiled
and
said
i
always
known
that
sound
carried
from
the
well
to
the
house
in
fact
in
past
years
i
found
it
amusing
to
listen
to
conversations
carried
on
by
persons
who
never
dreamed
that
their
words
were
overheard
then
that
explains
why
so
many
wishes
which
were
made
here
at
the
well
came
true
penny
cried
you
were
the
good
fairy
behind
it
all
oh
now
and
then
if
it
pleased
my
fancy
i
arranged
to
have
a
wish
granted
marborough
acknowledged
smiling
grimly
that
was
in
the
days
when
i
had
money
she
broke
off
and
ended
more
than
i
have
now
i
mean
marborough
you
must
have
heard
those
wishes
we
made
the
day
of
your
return
to
riverview
penny
said
after
a
moment
were
you
responsible
for
sending
a
basket
of
food
to
rhoda
people
i
am
afraid
i
was
and
did
you
grant
rhoda
second
wish
louise
asked
quickly
did
you
have
anything
to
do
with
getting
her
brother
ted
a
job
judge
harlan
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
marborough
explained
i
merely
wrote
him
a
note
suggesting
that
he
would
do
me
a
favor
by
helping
the
boy
if
he
found
him
worthy
although
the
widow
admission
cleared
up
much
of
the
mystery
which
had
surrounded
the
old
wishing
well
louise
and
penny
were
dumbfounded
nevertheless
never
once
had
anyone
in
riverview
connected
marborough
with
a
particularly
charitable
deed
as
if
guessing
their
thoughts
the
woman
said
sharply
now
mind
i
not
have
you
telling
this
around
the
town
i
through
with
all
such
silly
business
and
i
do
propose
to
have
busybodies
discuss
whether
or
not
i
am
why
mrs
marborough
protested
louise
it
was
a
kind
generous
thing
to
do
generous
fiddlesticks
i
did
it
because
it
pleased
me
and
for
no
other
reason
let
not
talk
about
it
any
more
marborough
questioned
the
girls
concerning
their
exploration
of
the
tunnel
her
disappointment
over
the
failure
to
find
the
pearls
was
keen
but
she
tried
not
to
show
it
i
knew
it
was
a
fool
errand
coming
to
riverview
to
look
for
that
stupid
necklace
she
declared
like
as
not
it
never
was
hidden
at
rose
acres
my
sister
letter
to
the
contrary
i
intend
to
forget
about
the
whole
affair
oh
marborough
do
give
up
so
soon
penny
pleaded
louise
and
i
have
only
started
to
search
we
may
find
it
yet
you
been
very
nice
the
widow
said
smiling
almost
in
a
friendly
way
i
remember
it
always
when
i
am
far
away
then
you
intend
to
leave
riverview
louise
asked
in
disappointment
i
must
sell
rose
acres
i
have
no
other
course
open
not
to
jay
franklin
i
hope
penny
exclaimed
i
have
no
intention
of
dealing
with
him
if
anyone
else
will
make
an
offer
so
far
i
have
found
no
other
person
who
is
interested
in
the
property
drawing
a
deep
sigh
marborough
arose
without
much
enthusiasm
she
invited
the
girls
to
come
with
her
into
the
house
but
they
tactfully
declined
we
come
again
tomorrow
if
you
do
mind
penny
said
as
she
and
louise
turned
to
leave
do
replied
marborough
we
might
make
a
final
search
for
the
pearls
enroute
to
riverview
the
girls
talked
over
the
situation
and
agreed
that
the
prospect
of
finding
the
necklace
was
a
slim
one
they
had
grown
to
like
the
eccentric
widow
and
were
sorry
that
she
had
decided
to
move
away
from
the
city
of
her
birth
i
am
sure
if
she
had
money
she
would
remain
here
louise
declared
and
it
will
nearly
kill
her
if
she
is
forced
to
deal
with
jay
franklin
how
she
does
dislike
him
parting
with
her
chum
in
the
business
section
of
riverview
penny
went
directly
to
the
office
her
father
was
ready
to
start
home
anything
new
about
jay
franklin
and
those
record
stones
he
hopes
to
sell
to
the
museum
penny
inquired
absently
as
the
automobile
sped
along
the
congested
streets
nothing
you
have
heard
parker
replied
franklin
expects
to
make
the
sale
and
probably
will
the
museum
people
have
put
themselves
on
record
as
saying
that
the
stones
bear
authentic
writing
then
it
appears
that
your
original
hunch
was
incorrect
penny
observed
too
bad
you
played
down
the
story
in
the
i
may
have
made
a
mistake
all
the
same
i
am
pinning
my
hopes
on
the
expert
from
brimwell
college
what
expert
dad
i
guess
i
neglected
to
tell
you
the
hired
professor
anjus
from
brimwell
to
inspect
the
stones
his
opinion
does
coincide
with
that
of
the
museum
experts
he
has
pronounced
them
fakes
if
the
experts
ca
agree
then
how
can
one
prove
anything
it
is
something
of
a
tangle
parker
smiled
i
turned
that
tool
you
obtained
from
crocker
over
to
professor
anjus
he
expects
to
make
exhaustive
tests
and
to
report
to
me
within
a
few
days
the
car
had
reached
the
outskirts
of
riverview
as
it
passed
along
streets
which
were
sparsely
dotted
with
houses
penny
called
attention
to
several
large
billboards
which
disfigured
the
landscape
look
dad
she
directed
pointing
to
a
particularly
colorful
poster
an
indian
show
is
coming
to
town
next
week
parker
turned
his
head
to
gaze
at
the
billboard
to
amazement
he
suddenly
slammed
on
the
brake
bringing
the
car
to
a
lurching
halt
at
the
side
of
the
road
that
it
he
cried
his
eyes
on
the
huge
sign
the
motive
i
figure
it
out
but
now
i
have
the
clue
i
need
penny
we
put
a
crimp
in
jay
franklin
little
game
or
my
name
is
anthony
parker
chapter
completely
mystified
by
her
father
remarks
penny
waited
for
him
to
explain
do
you
get
it
he
asked
waving
his
hand
toward
the
big
signboard
the
finding
of
those
stones
bearing
elizabethan
and
indian
writing
was
perfectly
timed
it
all
a
publicity
stunt
for
the
coming
show
how
could
it
be
penny
questioned
scarcely
able
to
accept
her
theory
i
found
one
of
the
rocks
myself
i
know
i
was
hired
by
any
indian
show
it
was
pure
luck
that
you
stumbled
into
the
stone
penny
if
you
had
someone
hired
by
the
indian
show
would
have
brought
it
to
light
but
where
does
jay
franklin
figure
in
dad
you
do
think
connected
with
the
publicity
scheme
as
you
call
it
franklin
would
have
sufficient
imagination
to
pull
off
a
stunt
like
that
parker
declared
no
he
may
actually
believe
in
the
authenticity
of
the
stones
at
any
rate
he
saw
an
opportunity
to
make
a
little
money
for
himself
and
seized
it
why
should
an
indian
show
go
to
the
trouble
of
having
stones
carved
and
planted
in
various
fields
it
does
make
sense
the
resulting
publicity
should
draw
attention
to
the
show
penny
it
just
the
sort
of
idea
which
would
appeal
to
a
clever
publicity
agent
every
newspaper
in
riverview
except
the
has
fallen
for
it
giving
columns
of
space
to
the
story
i
still
do
see
how
the
show
will
gain
its
name
never
has
been
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
finding
of
the
stones
of
course
not
penny
that
would
be
too
crude
but
at
the
proper
time
the
publicity
agent
will
twist
all
of
the
stories
to
his
own
purpose
dad
said
penny
sadly
in
the
past
you
have
accused
me
of
having
wild
ideas
i
think
the
score
is
even
now
i
have
that
show
traced
parker
declared
paying
no
heed
to
his
daughter
since
it
is
coming
to
riverview
next
week
it
ca
be
far
away
now
i
may
find
it
worth
while
to
call
on
the
publicity
agent
and
have
a
little
chat
with
him
penny
was
gazing
at
the
billboard
again
reading
the
dates
dad
the
show
will
play
here
during
pilgrimage
week
she
declared
what
a
shame
it
certain
to
take
away
customers
from
a
much
more
worthwhile
event
there
may
not
be
an
indian
show
responded
parker
grimly
not
when
i
get
through
with
the
outfit
immediately
upon
arriving
at
home
the
publisher
called
the
newspaper
office
delegating
city
editor
dewitt
to
obtain
complete
information
about
the
indian
show
and
to
report
to
him
all
evening
he
talked
of
his
theory
until
both
penny
and
weems
confessed
that
they
were
a
bit
weary
of
redskins
i
shall
write
an
editorial
for
tomorrow
parker
announced
even
if
i
have
absolute
facts
i
drop
a
few
broad
hints
about
those
fake
stones
the
editorial
cleverly
worded
but
with
very
definite
implications
was
composed
that
night
and
telephoned
to
the
newspaper
office
penny
had
the
pleasure
of
reading
it
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
you
certainly
did
yourself
proud
dad
she
praised
however
i
imagine
the
museum
people
are
going
to
be
too
pleased
nor
certain
other
folks
in
this
town
let
me
take
a
look
at
it
parker
requested
reaching
for
the
paper
as
penny
offered
it
to
him
the
doorbell
rang
weems
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
so
the
girl
arose
and
went
to
answer
it
jay
franklin
stood
on
the
porch
good
morning
he
said
in
a
hard
voice
is
your
father
here
yes
he
is
eating
breakfast
penny
responded
wo
you
come
in
please
franklin
walked
ahead
of
her
into
the
living
room
good
morning
jay
called
the
editor
who
was
able
to
see
the
caller
from
his
chair
at
the
breakfast
table
will
you
have
a
cup
of
coffee
with
us
ignoring
the
invitation
franklin
entered
the
dinette
blocking
the
doorway
from
his
pocket
he
took
a
copy
of
the
morning
parker
he
said
curtly
i
just
read
your
editorial
and
i
demand
an
explanation
do
you
realize
what
you
done
written
a
pretty
fair
stickful
or
so
my
daughter
tells
me
parker
smiled
undisturbed
you
deliberately
tried
to
smear
me
the
real
estate
man
accused
i
do
recall
that
your
name
was
mentioned
in
the
editorial
no
but
you
know
i
expect
to
sell
those
two
stones
to
the
museum
this
editorial
of
yours
may
queer
the
sale
then
it
will
have
fulfilled
its
purpose
the
stones
are
fakes
if
you
are
aware
of
it
i
suggest
that
you
acquaint
yourself
with
the
true
facts
those
stones
bear
genuine
elizabethan
writing
there
no
connection
with
any
cheap
indian
show
and
i
defy
you
to
prove
it
consider
your
challenge
accepted
replied
parker
evenly
i
expect
to
publish
the
true
facts
very
shortly
in
the
if
you
prevent
me
from
making
a
sale
to
the
museum
i
sue
you
jay
franklin
threatened
that
all
i
have
to
say
good
morning
in
his
anger
he
turned
so
quickly
that
he
ran
into
penny
who
stood
directly
behind
him
without
bothering
to
apologize
he
brushed
past
her
out
the
front
door
what
a
dreadful
man
remarked
weems
who
had
heard
the
conversation
from
the
kitchen
i
rather
expected
him
to
call
although
not
so
early
in
the
morning
the
publisher
remarked
reaching
for
a
slice
of
toast
his
attitude
does
bother
me
in
the
least
he
may
actually
sue
you
if
you
do
make
good
on
producing
facts
penny
commented
how
are
you
going
to
do
it
dewitt
informs
me
that
the
indian
show
is
playing
at
bryan
this
week
i
drive
over
there
today
and
see
what
i
can
learn
bryan
was
a
small
city
located
miles
from
riverview
although
penny
ordinarily
would
have
spent
the
day
in
school
she
immediately
decided
that
her
father
would
need
her
assistance
accordingly
she
begged
so
hard
to
accompany
him
that
he
finally
gave
his
consent
early
afternoon
saw
parker
and
his
daughter
at
the
outskirts
of
bryan
where
two
large
blue
and
red
show
tents
had
been
set
up
a
band
played
and
townspeople
were
pouring
past
the
an
indian
who
wore
the
headdress
of
a
chieftain
it
looks
rather
interesting
penny
remarked
wistfully
parker
stripped
a
bill
from
his
wallet
and
gave
it
to
her
go
buy
yourself
a
ticket
he
said
smiling
i
meet
you
here
by
the
entrance
in
an
hour
do
you
want
to
see
the
show
dad
i
outgrown
such
foolishness
he
rejoined
i
find
the
publicity
agent
and
have
my
little
talk
with
him
the
enticing
sound
of
and
indian
war
whoops
caused
penny
to
forget
her
desire
to
meet
the
show
publicity
man
saying
goodbye
to
her
father
she
bought
a
ticket
and
hastened
into
the
big
top
for
an
hour
she
sat
through
a
very
mediocre
performance
consisting
in
the
main
part
of
cowboy
and
indian
horseback
riding
the
concluding
event
a
tableau
depicted
an
attack
by
redskins
upon
an
early
english
colony
settlement
it
was
all
very
boring
and
penny
left
in
the
middle
of
the
performance
parker
was
not
waiting
at
the
entrance
way
loitering
about
for
a
time
she
inquired
of
a
workman
and
learned
that
her
father
was
in
one
of
the
small
tents
close
by
the
flap
had
been
rolled
back
permitting
her
to
see
a
man
of
thirty
who
sat
at
a
desk
piled
with
papers
is
that
the
show
publicity
agent
she
asked
the
workman
yep
bill
mcjavins
he
answered
he
sure
put
new
life
into
this
outfit
we
been
packin
them
in
ever
since
he
took
over
within
a
few
minutes
parker
joined
penny
and
from
the
expression
of
his
face
she
immediately
guessed
that
his
interview
had
not
been
very
successful
i
take
it
that
bill
mcjavins
did
break
down
and
confess
all
she
inquired
lightly
he
denied
any
connection
with
those
stones
found
in
riverview
parker
replied
but
in
the
next
breath
he
admitted
he
knew
all
about
them
and
intends
to
capitalize
on
the
story
just
how
will
it
help
the
show
from
what
mcjavins
told
me
i
gather
the
program
includes
an
historical
pageant
that
would
be
a
flattering
name
for
it
in
the
pageant
indians
attack
a
white
settlement
a
beautiful
maiden
escapes
and
chisels
on
a
stone
tablet
an
account
of
the
massacre
then
she
too
succumbs
to
the
tomahawk
you
seem
to
know
more
about
the
show
than
i
penny
laughed
anyway
i
glad
to
learn
how
it
came
out
it
my
guess
that
mcjavins
hopes
to
profit
by
a
between
the
stone
writing
of
the
pageant
and
the
finding
of
similar
rocks
near
riverview
it
a
cheap
trick
and
the
hoax
would
have
been
exposed
a
long
time
ago
if
museum
authorities
were
awake
neither
discouraged
nor
too
much
elated
by
the
results
of
the
trip
parker
and
penny
returned
to
riverview
it
was
exactly
noon
when
they
reached
the
newspaper
office
i
trust
you
plan
to
attend
school
this
afternoon
the
editor
reminded
his
daughter
by
lunching
downtown
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
get
there
loitering
about
the
newsroom
as
long
as
she
dared
penny
crossed
the
street
to
have
a
sandwich
at
a
cafe
as
she
reached
the
restaurant
she
observed
a
familiar
figure
coming
toward
her
rhoda
wiegand
she
exclaimed
are
you
going
in
the
wrong
direction
i
cutting
classes
for
the
afternoon
the
trailer
camp
girl
replied
pausing
coaten
expects
me
to
meet
him
at
the
fischer
building
can
you
tell
me
where
it
is
three
blocks
straight
down
the
street
penny
directed
she
hesitated
and
then
said
rhoda
it
none
of
my
affair
but
i
do
hope
you
not
agreeing
to
coaten
proposal
the
adoption
yes
i
am
penny
i
tried
to
hold
out
against
them
all
but
i
ca
do
it
ted
signed
the
papers
two
days
ago
since
then
had
no
peace
ted
keeps
after
me
the
breens
want
me
to
do
it
and
coaten
says
i
am
selfish
we
both
know
coaten
intends
to
profit
in
some
way
at
your
expense
i
do
feel
that
way
about
it
if
only
i
dared
stand
firm
you
must
penny
said
earnestly
deliberately
taking
rhoda
arm
she
turned
her
about
you
to
break
that
appointment
and
have
luncheon
with
me
i
assume
all
the
responsibility
chapter
rhoda
allowed
herself
to
be
dissuaded
but
not
without
misgiving
as
she
lunched
with
penny
at
the
dolman
cafe
she
painted
a
gloomy
picture
of
what
lay
before
her
you
do
understand
how
it
is
she
said
slowly
stirring
a
cup
of
hot
chocolate
i
really
have
a
good
reason
for
refusing
to
consent
to
the
adoption
if
i
had
one
scrap
of
evidence
against
coaten
it
would
be
different
ca
you
write
to
texas
and
inquire
about
him
and
his
friend
i
did
rhoda
admitted
the
answer
came
back
that
coaten
was
unknown
at
the
address
he
gave
the
breens
i
should
think
that
would
be
sufficient
reason
for
distrusting
him
oh
coaten
explained
it
by
saying
that
his
family
just
moved
to
a
new
house
and
that
he
inadvertently
had
given
me
the
wrong
address
did
you
ask
for
the
second
one
rhoda
yes
he
gave
it
to
me
so
far
i
not
had
time
for
a
reply
my
advice
is
to
stall
for
time
penny
said
if
we
have
even
a
few
days
more
we
may
dig
up
some
information
however
i
confess
i
have
an
idea
at
the
moment
coaten
will
be
furious
because
i
did
keep
the
appointment
rhoda
sighed
he
certain
to
come
to
the
trailer
camp
tonight
and
demand
an
explanation
just
tell
him
you
changed
your
mind
and
refuse
to
say
anything
more
i
wish
i
could
talk
to
him
so
do
i
declared
rhoda
with
emphasis
why
not
take
dinner
with
us
tonight
if
you
can
stand
our
brand
of
hospitality
well
i
do
know
penny
hesitated
louise
and
i
plan
to
go
to
marborough
place
directly
after
school
oh
i
wish
i
could
go
with
you
rhoda
declared
impulsively
i
never
have
had
an
opportunity
to
finish
my
sketch
marborough
is
such
an
interesting
character
too
you
do
know
the
half
of
it
laughed
penny
you
welcome
to
come
along
i
think
marborough
will
be
willing
to
share
our
secret
with
you
secret
no
questions
now
please
penny
requested
capturing
both
luncheon
checks
we
must
hurry
or
we
be
late
for
school
having
assured
marborough
that
she
would
disclose
nothing
about
the
lost
pearl
necklace
she
could
not
honorably
share
the
adventure
with
her
friend
however
it
was
her
hope
and
belief
that
the
widow
would
be
willing
to
allow
rhoda
to
aid
in
the
exciting
search
of
the
premises
penny
surmise
proved
entirely
correct
later
that
afternoon
when
the
three
girls
called
at
rose
acres
marborough
scarcely
noticed
that
rhoda
was
an
uninvited
member
of
the
party
at
once
she
began
talking
of
the
missing
pearls
which
to
the
satisfaction
of
louise
and
penny
necessitated
a
complete
explanation
imagine
finding
a
tunnel
leading
from
the
old
wishing
well
to
the
house
rhoda
cried
in
delight
take
me
through
it
show
me
everything
perhaps
you
can
find
the
pearls
penny
laughed
so
far
louise
and
i
have
failed
they
supposed
to
be
hidden
somewhere
near
the
old
wishing
well
louise
contributed
that
the
only
real
clue
we
have
i
suppose
you
looked
under
the
flagstones
i
did
that
many
days
ago
answered
marborough
in
fact
i
think
there
a
single
place
i
have
searched
the
roof
of
the
well
rhoda
suggested
we
never
once
thought
of
that
place
louise
exclaimed
but
how
could
the
necklace
be
secreted
there
she
frowned
as
she
stared
at
the
shingled
covering
which
formed
a
protection
over
the
well
it
worth
looking
at
anyhow
penny
declared
i
get
a
ladder
if
i
can
find
one
in
the
woodshed
directed
marborough
penny
soon
returned
carrying
a
which
had
not
seen
service
in
many
years
bracing
it
against
the
well
she
mounted
and
began
to
inspect
the
roof
find
anything
inquired
rhoda
impatiently
two
birds
nests
there
seems
to
be
a
hole
under
the
edge
of
the
roofing
penny
broke
off
as
she
ran
her
hand
into
the
narrow
opening
yes
there
is
something
here
she
exclaimed
a
moment
later
it
feels
like
a
tiny
box
marborough
and
the
two
girls
waited
tensely
hardly
daring
to
hope
penny
withdrew
her
hand
from
the
hole
triumphantly
holding
up
a
small
leather
case
this
is
it
she
asked
oh
yes
yes
marborough
cried
it
is
the
old
jewel
case
the
pearls
must
be
inside
in
her
haste
to
climb
down
from
the
ladder
penny
missed
one
of
the
steps
rhoda
seized
her
arm
saving
her
from
a
hard
fall
recovering
her
breath
penny
politely
offered
the
jewel
case
to
marborough
with
the
three
girls
clustered
about
her
the
mistress
of
rose
acres
ceremoniously
opened
the
lid
in
a
nest
of
yellowed
silk
lay
a
string
of
matched
pearls
so
beautiful
and
lustrous
that
no
one
could
find
words
to
admire
it
the
famous
marborough
pearls
the
widow
murmured
at
last
this
necklace
brought
only
unhappiness
to
our
family
now
however
they
shall
serve
a
useful
purpose
the
girls
gazed
at
marborough
expectantly
waiting
for
her
to
continue
i
shall
sell
the
pearls
she
said
quietly
they
represent
a
small
fortune
and
by
disposing
of
them
i
be
for
in
my
old
age
it
wo
be
necessary
for
me
to
pinch
and
skrimp
i
be
able
to
hold
my
head
up
in
society
live
like
a
human
being
again
instead
of
a
recluse
realizing
that
she
was
revealing
a
great
deal
marborough
snapped
shut
the
jewel
case
and
smiled
at
the
girls
i
never
should
have
found
the
pearls
by
myself
to
tell
you
that
i
am
grateful
scarcely
expresses
my
feelings
you
saved
me
from
poverty
rhoda
did
it
penny
declared
giving
full
credit
to
the
girl
louise
and
i
never
would
have
thought
of
searching
the
roof
of
the
well
do
come
inside
marborough
invited
gaily
we
have
tea
in
my
kitchen
it
not
much
to
offer
but
i
did
bake
a
little
sponge
cake
this
morning
no
longer
ashamed
of
the
barren
condition
of
the
old
mansion
the
widow
led
the
girls
through
the
great
empty
rooms
by
daylight
notwithstanding
the
stained
condition
of
the
walls
the
house
seemed
more
elegant
than
ever
there
was
a
large
window
of
stained
glass
which
penny
had
not
noticed
before
and
dozens
of
candle
holders
attached
to
the
walls
how
gorgeous
this
place
would
look
if
all
the
candles
could
be
lighted
at
one
time
she
remarked
admiringly
and
if
the
house
had
a
little
furniture
in
it
added
marborough
you
know
a
few
days
ago
i
did
a
very
foolish
thing
louise
glanced
quickly
at
penny
but
said
nothing
i
was
a
bit
hard
pressed
for
money
the
widow
resumed
on
an
impulse
i
sold
all
my
furniture
to
butterworth
do
you
suppose
he
will
sell
it
back
to
me
he
should
declared
penny
i
like
riverview
for
i
was
born
here
marborough
went
on
talking
as
if
to
herself
by
selling
the
pearls
i
can
refurnish
the
house
have
the
grounds
restored
to
their
original
beauty
and
live
as
i
formerly
did
oh
i
do
hope
you
decide
to
stay
here
penny
said
eagerly
marborough
started
a
fire
in
the
kitchen
stove
and
put
a
kettle
of
water
on
to
boil
soon
the
tea
was
ready
and
was
served
with
generous
slices
of
yellow
sponge
cake
i
suppose
everyone
in
riverview
considers
me
a
crotchety
old
woman
marborough
remarked
presently
i
have
been
very
friendly
because
i
did
want
folks
to
know
i
had
sold
my
furniture
some
days
ago
a
group
of
women
came
to
see
me
about
opening
the
house
for
some
sort
of
festival
pilgrimage
week
penny
supplied
i
turned
them
down
not
because
i
was
eager
to
help
but
because
i
could
let
folks
know
all
my
furniture
was
gone
i
wonder
if
they
would
still
care
to
include
rose
acres
in
the
tour
of
houses
oh
marborough
it
would
practically
save
the
festival
penny
cried
a
cheap
indian
show
is
coming
to
town
the
same
week
i
know
for
a
fact
that
the
festival
tickets
are
selling
very
well
everyone
wants
to
see
rose
acres
louise
added
enthusiastically
if
i
can
my
furniture
i
be
glad
to
open
the
house
to
the
public
marborough
said
her
eyes
twinkling
as
she
gazed
directly
at
penny
that
was
the
wish
you
made
at
the
well
i
believe
oh
it
was
and
you
make
it
come
true
it
little
enough
to
do
in
return
for
the
favor
you
have
bestowed
upon
me
nothing
will
please
me
more
than
to
see
this
old
house
in
all
its
glory
penny
declared
enthusiastically
may
we
light
all
the
candles
at
one
time
if
you
like
and
would
it
be
fun
to
hold
a
grand
ball
here
with
everyone
dressed
in
colonial
costume
penny
went
on
ca
you
just
see
the
place
with
beaux
and
their
ladies
dancing
a
quadrille
i
talk
to
the
members
of
the
festival
committee
tomorrow
marborough
promised
my
first
call
however
will
be
upon
mr
butterworth
long
shadows
were
falling
and
the
girls
soon
arose
to
depart
during
the
walk
into
riverview
rhoda
became
rather
sober
and
penny
shrewdly
guessed
that
she
had
forgotten
about
the
marborough
pearls
and
was
thinking
of
the
dreaded
interview
with
coaten
you
really
afraid
to
meet
that
man
are
you
she
asked
curiously
not
exactly
afraid
rhoda
responded
he
be
waiting
though
sure
i
just
do
know
what
to
tell
him
will
it
be
easier
for
you
if
i
go
with
you
to
the
camp
oh
i
wish
you
would
penny
rhoda
said
gratefully
louise
soon
parted
with
her
friends
and
the
two
girls
went
on
to
the
trailer
camp
breen
immediately
informed
them
that
coaten
had
called
earlier
in
the
afternoon
and
expected
to
return
again
i
hope
you
did
make
trouble
about
signing
the
papers
she
said
severely
he
acted
quite
upset
i
broke
our
appointment
rhoda
responded
briefly
so
far
i
not
made
up
my
mind
what
to
do
there
followed
a
lengthy
argument
in
which
breen
assured
the
girl
that
she
was
making
a
serious
mistake
by
antagonizing
such
a
kind
generous
man
as
coaten
penny
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
although
she
readily
could
see
how
difficult
had
become
rhoda
position
you
have
to
stay
to
dinner
now
rhoda
whispered
to
her
coaten
is
certain
to
come
and
i
ca
stand
against
them
all
penny
had
no
desire
to
remain
for
a
meal
but
feeling
that
she
should
support
her
friend
accepted
the
invitation
ted
soon
came
home
from
working
at
judge
harlan
office
and
he
too
expressed
displeasure
because
his
sister
had
broken
the
appointment
with
coaten
during
dinner
the
subject
was
studiously
avoided
somewhat
to
disapproval
rhoda
began
to
tell
the
breens
about
everything
that
had
occurred
at
rose
acres
at
mention
of
the
pearl
necklace
ted
fork
clattered
against
his
plate
and
he
forgot
to
eat
you
actually
found
a
string
of
pearls
he
asked
incredulously
real
ones
they
must
be
worth
many
thousand
dollars
rhoda
assured
him
marborough
intends
to
sell
them
and
use
the
money
to
remodel
her
place
ted
was
about
to
ask
another
question
then
seemed
to
reconsider
more
stew
breen
asked
as
an
awkward
silence
fell
no
thanks
mom
he
answered
if
you
excuse
me
i
skip
out
i
have
a
date
uptown
with
a
fellow
breen
made
no
reply
and
the
boy
left
the
trailer
penny
thought
that
she
too
should
be
leaving
but
before
she
could
speak
there
came
a
light
tap
on
the
door
breen
thrust
his
head
out
the
open
window
it
coaten
he
announced
in
a
hoarse
whisper
what
are
you
going
to
tell
him
rhoda
i
do
know
she
answered
gazing
helplessly
at
penny
chapter
marborough
breen
hastily
removed
her
apron
and
opened
the
door
to
admit
the
caller
good
evening
said
coaten
his
gaze
roved
from
one
person
to
another
in
the
crowded
little
room
coming
to
rest
upon
rhoda
i
sorry
i
could
keep
our
appointment
this
afternoon
she
said
stiffly
the
truth
is
i
changed
my
mind
about
signing
that
paper
i
tried
to
talk
sense
into
her
breen
broke
in
i
do
know
what
come
over
the
girl
lately
coaten
seated
himself
on
the
day
bed
smiling
at
rhoda
in
a
friendly
way
i
understand
how
you
feel
he
said
you
are
afraid
you
do
know
me
well
enough
to
agree
to
the
adoption
i
never
heard
of
you
until
you
came
to
riverview
rhoda
that
no
way
to
talk
breen
reprimanded
what
would
we
have
done
without
coaten
he
given
us
money
bought
groceries
and
made
everything
much
easier
i
appreciate
everything
it
just
that
well
i
do
care
to
be
adopted
i
like
things
as
they
are
breen
kindly
face
tightened
into
hard
lines
rhoda
she
said
firmly
this
is
an
opportunity
for
you
and
you
ought
to
be
smart
enough
to
realize
it
coaten
will
give
you
good
clothes
and
schooling
pop
and
i
ca
do
it
you
given
me
too
much
now
rhoda
murmured
her
gaze
on
the
linoleum
rug
i
been
patient
with
you
but
now
i
going
to
have
my
say
we
keep
you
any
more
you
telling
me
to
go
rhoda
gasped
scarcely
believing
that
she
had
heard
correctly
i
asking
you
to
sign
whatever
it
is
that
coaten
wants
you
to
rhoda
gazed
at
penny
her
lips
trembling
there
seemed
but
one
course
open
to
her
for
she
had
no
money
and
no
relatives
fully
aware
of
her
predicament
coaten
smiled
triumphantly
from
his
pocket
he
whipped
out
a
fountain
pen
and
a
folded
paper
rhoda
do
sign
unless
you
really
wish
to
penny
said
quietly
but
i
have
no
home
you
may
stay
with
me
i
find
a
place
for
you
directing
her
gaze
upon
coaten
penny
resumed
may
i
ask
why
you
are
so
eager
to
obtain
a
guardianship
over
ted
and
rhoda
what
do
you
expect
to
gain
by
it
my
dear
young
lady
coaten
voice
was
soft
but
his
eyes
glinted
angrily
i
expect
to
gain
nothing
i
gathered
a
different
impression
when
i
heard
you
and
your
friend
talking
a
night
or
so
ago
at
the
marborough
place
at
first
coaten
did
not
appear
to
understand
then
as
penny
meaning
dawned
upon
him
he
arose
from
the
couch
i
have
no
wish
to
discuss
this
matter
with
you
a
stranger
he
said
coldly
for
some
reason
you
are
prejudiced
against
me
and
have
deliberately
influenced
rhoda
to
go
against
breen
desires
it
a
question
for
our
own
family
to
settle
breen
added
i
go
at
once
said
penny
she
gazed
questioningly
at
rhoda
do
you
really
think
you
could
take
me
in
at
your
place
the
girl
asked
of
course
my
offer
holds
then
i
come
with
you
darting
to
a
wardrobe
closet
rhoda
began
to
toss
garments
into
a
suitcase
rhoda
you
ca
go
like
this
breen
cried
in
protest
why
you
listen
to
reason
let
her
go
coaten
said
harshly
she
come
back
in
a
day
or
two
glad
to
accept
my
offer
rhoda
paid
no
heed
to
the
conversation
which
flowed
about
her
swiftly
she
packed
her
suitcase
and
told
penny
that
she
was
ready
to
leave
breen
she
said
squeezing
the
woman
hand
in
parting
you
and
pop
have
been
wonderful
to
ted
and
me
i
never
forget
it
never
someday
i
repay
you
too
this
is
the
way
you
do
it
breen
retorted
bitterly
by
defying
my
wishes
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
penny
and
rhoda
quickly
left
the
trailer
carrying
the
suitcase
between
them
i
should
have
done
it
the
girl
murmured
contritely
i
do
know
how
i
ever
manage
to
make
a
living
ted
likely
will
side
against
me
too
do
think
of
anything
tonight
penny
advised
although
she
too
was
worried
we
find
something
for
you
dad
may
have
an
opening
on
the
weems
long
ago
had
ceased
to
be
surprised
by
anything
that
penny
did
and
so
when
the
two
girls
arrived
at
the
parker
home
she
did
not
ask
many
questions
rhoda
was
comfortably
established
in
the
guest
room
and
made
to
feel
that
she
was
welcome
however
ultimately
learning
what
had
occurred
the
housekeeper
was
not
at
all
certain
that
penny
had
done
right
by
helping
the
girl
to
leave
home
nor
was
parker
encouraging
about
the
prospects
of
finding
employment
can
she
type
or
take
shorthand
he
asked
bluntly
i
do
think
so
penny
admitted
the
ca
be
made
a
for
your
unemployed
friends
parker
resumed
severely
my
advice
is
to
send
her
back
to
the
breens
i
ca
do
that
dad
you
do
understand
well
let
it
ride
for
a
few
days
her
father
replied
frowning
see
what
i
can
do
penny
tried
to
keep
rhoda
from
realizing
that
her
presence
in
the
household
had
created
a
problem
in
the
morning
the
girls
went
to
school
together
returned
for
lunch
and
then
attended
the
afternoon
session
rhoda
became
increasingly
gloomy
penny
this
ca
go
on
indefinitely
she
protested
i
have
to
get
a
job
somehow
let
me
worry
about
that
ted
has
come
to
see
me
either
rhoda
went
on
nervously
i
beginning
to
think
i
should
go
back
and
sign
that
paper
do
even
consider
it
penny
said
firmly
you
need
diversion
to
keep
your
mind
off
the
problem
let
hike
out
to
the
marborough
place
carrying
their
books
the
girls
set
off
for
rose
acres
several
windows
on
the
lower
floor
of
the
house
had
been
opened
to
admit
fresh
air
and
the
blinds
no
longer
were
drawn
for
the
first
time
since
marborough
return
the
old
mansion
actually
had
a
lived
in
appearance
however
although
penny
knocked
many
times
the
widow
did
not
come
to
the
door
she
ca
be
here
rhoda
remarked
at
last
the
windows
are
open
penny
said
thoughtfully
i
doubt
that
marborough
would
go
very
far
away
without
closing
them
the
girls
wandered
to
the
wishing
well
and
then
made
a
complete
tour
of
the
grounds
marborough
was
nowhere
in
the
yard
shall
we
go
rhoda
asked
i
knock
on
the
door
just
once
more
penny
said
i
ca
help
feeling
that
she
is
here
circling
the
house
to
the
side
entrance
the
girls
again
rapped
and
waited
listen
commanded
penny
suddenly
i
do
hear
anything
declared
rhoda
startled
by
the
manner
in
which
her
companion
had
given
the
command
i
thought
someone
called
or
groaned
the
sound
came
from
inside
the
house
you
must
have
imagined
it
maybe
i
did
penny
acknowledged
but
i
do
think
so
testing
the
door
she
found
it
unlocked
as
it
swung
back
a
tiny
crack
she
called
loudly
oh
marborough
are
you
at
home
distinctly
both
girls
heard
an
answering
cry
but
the
words
were
unintelligible
the
sound
had
come
from
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
marborough
must
be
ill
penny
gasped
for
the
voice
had
been
very
weak
hesitating
no
longer
she
entered
the
house
and
with
rhoda
trailing
close
behind
ran
to
the
kitchen
marborough
still
garbed
in
night
clothing
lay
on
the
daybed
her
face
ashen
the
woman
breathed
with
the
greatest
of
difficulty
and
both
girls
knew
at
once
that
she
was
seriously
my
heart
marborough
whispered
an
attack
last
night
rhoda
run
as
fast
as
you
can
and
get
doctor
hamilton
penny
said
tersely
i
stay
here
as
soon
as
her
friend
had
gone
she
busied
herself
trying
to
make
marborough
comfortable
she
rearranged
the
disordered
blankets
and
fanned
air
toward
the
woman
making
it
easier
for
her
to
breathe
my
pearls
marborough
whispered
after
a
moment
they
gone
penny
thought
little
of
the
remark
deciding
that
the
widow
was
not
entirely
rational
oh
you
have
the
necklace
she
said
soothingly
do
you
remember
we
found
it
yesterday
gone
marborough
repeated
it
gave
me
such
a
shock
i
had
hidden
the
pearls
in
the
teapot
this
morning
penny
bent
closer
suddenly
realizing
that
the
old
lady
was
in
possession
of
her
faculties
and
was
trying
to
disclose
something
of
great
importance
i
went
there
this
morning
marborough
completed
with
difficulty
the
pearls
were
gone
they
been
stolen
now
i
have
nothing
chapter
missing
penny
tried
to
quiet
the
old
lady
by
assuring
her
that
the
pearl
necklace
must
be
somewhere
in
the
house
no
no
it
is
gone
marborough
insisted
a
thief
entered
the
house
during
the
night
the
shock
of
it
brought
on
this
attack
spent
by
the
effort
required
to
speak
the
widow
closed
her
eyes
and
relaxed
thinking
that
she
had
gone
to
sleep
penny
left
the
bedside
for
a
moment
a
quick
glance
assured
her
that
the
kitchen
window
was
open
and
far
more
alarming
the
screen
had
been
neatly
cut
from
its
frame
an
empty
china
teapot
stood
on
the
kitchen
table
it
must
be
true
penny
thought
with
a
sinking
heart
the
pearls
have
been
stolen
and
the
shock
of
it
nearly
killed
marborough
but
who
could
have
known
that
she
had
the
necklace
here
in
the
house
louise
and
rhoda
were
beyond
suspicion
and
for
a
moment
she
could
think
of
no
others
who
had
knowledge
of
the
pearls
then
with
a
start
it
came
to
her
that
the
story
had
been
told
the
previous
night
at
the
breens
ted
knew
about
it
and
he
was
interested
she
thought
but
i
believe
he
would
do
such
a
contemptible
thing
even
if
he
did
once
steal
a
chicken
penny
unhappy
reflections
were
broken
by
the
arrival
of
rhoda
with
doctor
hamilton
for
the
next
half
hour
the
girls
were
kept
more
than
busy
carrying
out
his
instructions
marborough
in
a
way
you
have
been
very
fortunate
the
doctor
said
as
he
finally
prepared
to
leave
the
house
your
attack
has
been
a
light
one
and
with
proper
care
you
should
be
on
your
feet
again
within
a
week
or
two
i
arrange
to
have
you
taken
to
the
hospital
at
once
the
widow
tried
to
raise
up
in
bed
i
wo
go
she
announced
hospitals
cost
money
more
than
i
have
to
spend
it
wo
cost
you
anything
marborough
i
arrange
everything
i
refuse
to
be
a
charity
patient
the
widow
declared
defiantly
die
first
go
away
and
take
your
pills
with
you
then
if
you
refuse
hospital
care
i
must
arrange
for
a
nurse
i
ca
afford
that
either
the
old
lady
snapped
just
go
away
and
i
get
along
by
myself
i
feeling
better
if
i
could
only
have
a
cup
of
tea
i
make
it
for
you
rhoda
offered
eagerly
penny
signaled
to
the
doctor
indicating
that
she
wished
him
to
follow
her
into
another
room
once
beyond
the
hearing
of
the
old
lady
she
outlined
a
plan
marborough
likes
rhoda
very
much
she
said
to
the
doctor
i
think
she
might
be
perfectly
satisfied
to
be
looked
after
by
her
the
girl
seems
sensible
and
efficient
doctor
hamilton
replied
but
would
she
be
willing
to
stay
i
think
she
might
for
she
has
no
home
of
her
own
relieved
to
have
the
problem
solved
so
easily
the
doctor
declared
that
the
plan
could
be
tried
for
a
few
days
at
least
i
drop
in
again
late
tonight
he
promised
picking
up
his
bag
consulted
by
penny
rhoda
said
at
once
that
she
would
be
happy
indeed
to
remain
with
marborough
as
long
as
her
services
were
required
the
widow
too
seemed
pleased
by
the
arrangement
it
very
good
of
you
she
murmured
to
rhoda
i
ca
pay
you
though
not
unless
my
pearls
are
recovered
your
pearls
the
girl
echoed
in
astonishment
penny
drew
her
friend
aside
explaining
what
had
occurred
rhoda
was
shocked
to
learn
that
the
necklace
had
been
stolen
how
dreadful
she
gasped
who
could
have
taken
the
pearls
apparently
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
her
own
brother
ted
might
be
regarded
with
suspicion
penny
was
much
too
kind
to
drop
such
a
hint
and
kept
her
thoughts
strictly
to
herself
however
later
in
the
day
with
marborough
permission
she
made
a
full
report
of
the
theft
to
local
police
an
officer
visited
rose
acres
but
aside
from
establishing
exactly
how
the
house
had
been
entered
obtained
few
useful
clues
questioned
at
considerable
length
penny
disclosed
that
so
far
as
she
knew
only
louise
sidell
the
trailer
camp
family
ted
rhoda
and
herself
had
known
that
the
pearls
were
in
the
mansion
we
keep
that
breen
family
under
surveillance
the
officer
promised
i
let
you
know
if
anything
develops
another
problem
immediately
confronted
penny
an
inspection
of
the
cupboards
of
the
marborough
home
had
revealed
that
there
was
barely
enough
food
to
last
a
day
buy
whatever
you
need
the
widow
instructed
you
find
money
in
the
top
bureau
drawer
by
diligent
search
the
girls
found
four
dollars
and
cents
which
they
felt
certain
was
all
the
money
the
old
lady
possessed
why
the
medicines
doctor
hamilton
ordered
will
take
almost
this
much
penny
said
in
dismay
something
must
be
done
both
girls
respected
marborough
desire
for
secrecy
but
they
knew
it
would
not
be
possible
to
help
her
and
at
the
same
time
prevent
the
townspeople
from
learning
of
her
dire
poverty
deeply
troubled
penny
placed
the
problem
in
weems
hands
why
that
poor
woman
the
housekeeper
explained
to
think
that
she
is
sick
and
has
the
things
that
she
needs
i
send
a
basket
of
food
at
once
i
am
sure
many
people
will
be
eager
to
help
weems
busied
herself
at
the
telephone
and
within
a
few
hours
all
manner
of
useful
gifts
began
to
arrive
at
rose
acres
neighbors
came
to
help
rhoda
with
the
housework
and
to
care
for
the
widow
as
was
inevitable
the
entire
story
of
marborough
poverty
including
the
loss
of
the
pearl
necklace
circulated
throughout
riverview
since
there
no
longer
was
any
excuse
for
secrecy
penny
disclosed
to
members
of
the
pilgrimage
committee
what
had
become
of
the
old
lady
furniture
and
why
she
had
refused
to
open
her
house
during
festival
week
to
her
delight
a
fund
immediately
was
raised
for
the
purpose
of
the
valuable
antiques
butterworth
pleased
to
cooperate
agreed
to
sell
the
furniture
for
exactly
the
price
he
had
paid
the
days
drifted
slowly
along
under
rhoda
faithful
care
marborough
soon
was
able
to
sit
up
in
a
wheel
chair
much
subdued
since
the
heart
attack
she
had
little
to
say
even
when
a
moving
van
arrived
with
her
household
furnishings
but
one
afternoon
while
penny
was
inserting
new
candles
in
the
glass
candelabrum
she
so
much
admired
the
old
lady
watched
her
from
her
chair
by
the
window
you
and
rhoda
have
fixed
the
house
up
so
nicely
she
said
you
been
very
kind
to
me
and
so
have
all
the
folks
in
riverview
you
have
a
great
many
friends
marborough
penny
replied
smiling
you
never
gave
them
a
chance
to
show
it
before
perhaps
i
have
been
unfriendly
the
widow
acknowledged
i
did
mean
to
be
now
that
i
like
to
show
my
appreciation
there
no
way
to
do
it
if
only
the
police
would
get
busy
and
find
the
rascal
who
stole
my
necklace
penny
did
not
reply
immediately
for
she
could
think
of
nothing
encouraging
to
say
she
and
rhoda
both
believed
that
the
thief
who
had
taken
the
pearls
never
would
be
apprehended
marborough
she
said
at
length
there
is
a
way
you
could
show
the
people
of
riverview
how
you
feel
but
i
sure
you
would
care
to
do
it
by
opening
my
home
for
the
pilgrimage
the
widow
asked
smiling
that
what
i
had
in
mind
but
of
course
when
is
the
festival
marborough
broke
in
i
lost
track
of
time
since
i
been
sick
it
starts
day
after
tomorrow
penny
drew
a
deep
sigh
i
afraid
the
festival
may
be
a
failure
for
not
half
enough
tickets
have
been
sold
would
it
help
to
include
this
house
in
the
pilgrimage
it
would
save
the
festival
cried
penny
you
not
well
enough
to
go
through
with
it
though
fiddlesticks
marborough
snapped
her
spirits
reviving
i
like
nothing
better
than
a
big
party
what
pleasure
is
it
sitting
in
a
wheel
chair
staring
at
a
cracked
wall
now
you
go
ahead
and
plan
it
just
the
way
you
like
with
time
so
short
penny
flew
into
action
she
contacted
members
of
the
festival
committee
and
immediately
a
new
publicity
campaign
was
launched
it
was
announced
that
rose
acres
would
be
included
in
the
pilgrimage
and
that
a
grand
costume
ball
at
the
mansion
would
be
open
to
the
public
the
affair
is
certain
to
be
a
success
penny
told
her
father
enthusiastically
i
wish
though
that
the
indian
show
was
playing
riverview
at
the
same
time
by
the
way
have
you
made
any
further
progress
in
proving
that
jay
franklin
record
stones
are
fakes
not
very
much
parker
ruefully
admitted
a
report
came
back
on
that
tool
you
picked
up
at
truman
crocker
shack
what
was
the
verdict
dad
professor
anjus
the
expert
who
examined
the
chisel
says
he
believes
the
stones
could
have
been
marked
with
it
then
truman
crocker
may
be
the
guilty
person
it
not
at
all
certain
in
all
events
i
still
hold
to
my
original
theory
that
the
hoax
was
planned
by
bill
mcjavins
of
the
indian
show
i
certainly
hope
franklin
fails
in
trying
to
sell
the
stones
to
the
museum
so
do
i
agreed
the
editor
unfortunately
unless
i
dig
up
evidence
very
quickly
the
transaction
will
take
place
penny
did
not
give
a
great
deal
of
thought
to
the
affair
of
the
record
stones
for
marborough
illness
had
centered
her
interest
at
rose
acres
in
truth
she
was
far
more
concerned
about
the
missing
pearls
the
police
had
made
no
progress
in
tracing
the
necklace
and
held
scant
hope
the
thief
would
be
captured
as
for
ted
wiegand
penny
was
unable
to
make
up
her
mind
whether
or
not
he
was
the
guilty
person
although
he
still
worked
for
judge
harlan
she
seldom
saw
him
occasionally
reports
of
his
progress
were
given
to
her
by
rhoda
ted
is
provoked
at
me
any
more
she
assured
penny
he
beginning
to
think
as
i
do
that
coaten
has
been
up
to
something
crooked
i
know
for
a
fact
that
he
gave
breen
money
to
force
me
out
of
the
family
are
those
two
men
still
in
town
penny
asked
thoughtfully
rhoda
nodded
they
been
here
to
see
me
twice
marborough
sent
them
away
the
last
time
she
dislikes
them
both
because
they
once
came
here
to
ask
if
they
could
rent
rooms
that
must
have
been
the
night
i
overheard
them
talking
at
the
wishing
well
penny
returned
she
remained
silent
a
moment
thinking
suddenly
she
glanced
up
her
eyes
dancing
rhoda
i
have
an
idea
what
is
it
penny
it
might
not
work
but
if
it
should
we
learn
why
coaten
is
so
eager
to
adopt
you
and
ted
tell
me
what
you
have
in
mind
it
like
this
rhoda
if
we
could
induce
coaten
and
his
friend
to
come
to
rose
acres
on
the
night
of
the
costume
ball
i
know
how
they
might
be
made
to
talk
strong
arm
methods
rhoda
asked
slightly
amused
indeed
not
the
old
wishing
well
will
turn
the
trick
you
certainly
have
me
puzzled
penny
getting
those
men
here
will
be
the
most
difficult
penny
went
on
thinking
aloud
but
i
can
sell
them
a
ticket
to
the
ball
failing
that
i
give
them
one
free
there
still
no
guarantee
they
would
come
i
know
how
we
can
make
sure
of
it
rhoda
you
can
write
coaten
a
note
asking
him
to
meet
you
here
at
ten
the
ball
will
be
in
full
sway
by
that
time
if
you
hint
you
decided
to
sign
the
adoption
papers
he
certain
to
come
and
then
how
will
i
get
out
of
it
leave
that
part
to
me
penny
chuckled
we
get
coaten
here
and
you
to
talk
with
him
beside
the
wishing
well
why
in
that
particular
place
i
ca
tell
you
now
penny
said
smiling
mysteriously
just
accept
my
word
for
it
that
it
of
utmost
importance
as
soon
as
you
get
the
men
at
the
wishing
well
make
an
excuse
and
run
into
the
house
leaving
them
together
and
then
what
rhoda
asked
completely
bewildered
from
that
point
the
old
well
and
i
will
take
over
penny
laughed
i
ca
tell
you
another
thing
but
if
my
scheme
works
and
i
think
it
will
coaten
little
game
will
be
exposed
in
a
most
dramatic
way
chapter
everything
will
be
ruined
everything
wailed
penny
she
stood
in
the
living
room
at
rose
acres
her
face
pressed
almost
against
the
window
pane
it
been
raining
for
an
hour
straight
no
one
will
come
to
the
party
oh
do
take
it
so
hard
rhoda
said
cheerfully
you
know
over
three
hundred
tickets
were
sold
even
if
the
rain
does
cut
down
the
crowd
still
have
as
many
people
as
this
house
can
accommodate
admiringly
her
gaze
wandered
about
the
room
which
glowed
brilliantly
with
the
light
of
dozens
of
candles
every
chair
was
in
place
flowers
decorated
the
vases
and
at
the
square
piano
sat
marborough
in
rustling
black
silk
playing
a
few
tinkling
chords
you
must
tire
yourself
rhoda
said
to
her
not
until
the
guests
come
at
least
i
never
felt
better
in
my
life
marborough
insisted
why
i
as
excited
as
a
school
girl
is
judge
harlan
really
coming
to
the
ball
everyone
of
consequence
in
riverview
will
be
here
rhoda
assured
her
even
two
of
penny
special
guests
that
what
worries
me
penny
confessed
beginning
to
pace
the
floor
i
have
my
trap
all
ready
to
spring
but
if
this
horrid
rain
keeps
up
how
can
you
meet
coaten
by
the
well
why
ca
i
talk
to
him
in
the
library
because
it
wo
do
penny
said
patiently
the
entire
scheme
will
fail
unless
you
carry
out
your
part
exactly
as
we
planned
it
the
rain
is
letting
up
marborough
declared
carefully
moving
from
the
piano
to
her
wheel
chair
mark
my
words
it
will
all
be
over
within
fifteen
minutes
oh
i
hope
so
penny
breathed
i
hope
so
to
her
gratification
the
rain
did
cease
within
a
short
while
and
members
of
the
festival
committee
and
hired
musicians
began
to
arrive
for
the
occasion
penny
rhoda
and
louise
had
rented
colonial
costumes
with
fancy
powdered
wigs
they
hovered
near
the
front
door
ready
to
greet
the
first
guests
it
going
to
be
a
wonderful
party
louise
remarked
happily
soon
visitors
began
to
arrive
in
groups
the
orchestra
struck
up
and
the
ballroom
became
thronged
with
dancers
marborough
is
having
a
marvelous
time
rhoda
told
louise
in
fact
so
is
everyone
except
penny
she
worried
because
coaten
has
come
two
men
alighted
from
a
taxi
and
walked
up
the
path
to
the
house
here
they
come
now
penny
whispered
excitedly
quick
rhoda
keep
out
of
sight
until
i
give
the
word
barely
had
the
girl
vanished
than
coaten
and
his
companion
reached
the
reception
line
penny
greeted
them
with
unusual
warmth
is
rhoda
wiegand
here
coaten
asked
curtly
we
came
to
see
her
not
to
attend
the
party
she
was
around
a
moment
ago
penny
answered
why
do
you
look
for
her
in
the
garden
perhaps
by
the
wishing
well
the
instant
the
two
men
had
gone
penny
quickly
ran
to
find
rhoda
now
remember
do
talk
to
coaten
except
at
the
wishing
well
she
issued
final
instructions
then
when
he
asks
you
to
sign
the
paper
make
an
excuse
and
leave
i
wo
forget
rhoda
nodded
but
i
still
do
understand
what
up
to
anxiously
penny
watched
from
the
porch
until
she
saw
that
her
friend
actually
was
talking
to
the
two
men
beside
the
wishing
well
then
running
into
the
crowded
ballroom
she
signaled
the
musicians
to
stop
the
music
clapping
her
hands
for
attention
she
announced
ladies
and
gentlemen
a
little
surprise
the
old
wishing
well
speaks
listen
and
you
may
hear
the
conversation
of
unwary
guests
who
reveal
their
secrets
beside
it
reaching
for
a
box
secreted
in
a
clump
of
artificial
palms
penny
turned
a
switch
the
startled
dancers
heard
a
crackling
sound
and
then
voice
came
in
on
the
loudspeaker
clear
and
distinct
i
thought
it
over
coaten
were
her
words
even
though
i
understand
why
you
wish
to
adopt
ted
and
me
i
agree
to
the
guardianship
ah
i
knew
you
would
come
to
your
senses
coaten
answered
just
sign
this
paper
and
we
be
able
to
go
into
court
and
settle
everything
there
was
a
slight
pause
and
then
rhoda
said
will
you
excuse
me
a
moment
coaten
i
want
to
run
into
the
house
but
i
be
back
those
in
the
ballroom
had
gathered
close
to
penny
listening
with
interest
to
the
conversation
but
curious
to
learn
its
significance
listen
she
commanded
as
many
persons
began
to
comment
the
two
men
who
stood
alone
at
the
wishing
well
were
talking
again
and
penny
did
not
intend
to
miss
a
single
word
now
what
possessed
rhoda
she
heard
coaten
mutter
is
she
going
to
back
out
again
no
we
have
her
nailed
this
time
the
other
answered
that
land
is
as
good
as
ours
as
soon
as
the
adoption
is
legal
we
put
in
our
claim
the
texano
oil
company
will
pay
handsomely
what
those
youngsters
know
wo
hurt
them
the
words
blaring
out
into
the
ballroom
were
exactly
what
penny
wished
to
hear
believing
themselves
to
be
alone
the
two
men
were
making
damaging
admissions
however
although
it
was
evident
that
they
meant
to
profit
at
rhoda
expense
she
could
not
understand
exactly
what
they
meant
to
do
judge
harlan
stepped
forward
to
inspect
the
radio
equipment
what
is
this
he
inquired
a
special
joke
of
yours
penelope
it
no
joke
she
assured
him
earnestly
coaten
has
been
trying
to
force
rhoda
and
ted
to
agree
to
an
adoption
we
were
suspicious
of
him
and
so
we
arranged
this
little
affair
how
is
the
sound
brought
into
the
house
i
had
a
microphone
installed
inside
the
wishing
well
penny
revealed
the
wires
run
through
an
underground
tunnel
very
clever
very
clever
indeed
murmured
the
judge
and
the
meaning
of
the
conversation
i
do
know
penny
confessed
coaten
is
trying
to
cheat
rhoda
and
ted
but
how
i
ca
guess
they
own
no
property
coaten
spoke
of
the
texano
oil
company
the
judge
said
thoughtfully
that
gives
me
a
faint
inkling
he
did
not
finish
for
at
that
instant
rhoda
came
hurriedly
into
the
room
penny
motioned
for
her
to
join
the
group
by
the
loudspeaker
rhoda
said
the
judge
turning
to
her
did
your
father
own
land
in
texas
never
she
replied
promptly
the
only
person
in
our
family
who
owned
property
was
grandfather
he
had
a
large
farm
but
sold
it
long
before
his
death
do
you
know
the
location
of
the
property
inquired
the
judge
i
believe
it
was
near
the
town
of
elkland
elkland
then
perhaps
we
have
the
explanation
less
than
a
month
ago
oil
was
discovered
in
that
locality
but
the
wiegand
land
was
sold
years
ago
penny
murmured
much
litigation
has
resulted
from
the
fact
that
in
the
past
many
texas
properties
were
sold
with
oil
rights
reserved
explained
the
judge
now
this
is
only
a
guess
however
if
rhoda
grandfather
kept
such
oil
rights
as
he
may
well
have
done
his
heirs
would
have
indisputable
claim
to
any
income
derived
from
such
source
the
loudspeaker
had
come
to
life
again
as
the
two
men
at
the
wishing
well
resumed
their
conversation
everyone
in
the
ballroom
strained
to
hear
the
words
we
get
out
of
riverview
just
as
soon
as
the
girl
signs
the
paper
coaten
said
to
his
companion
we
wasted
enough
time
in
this
town
oh
i
should
say
wasted
drawled
carl
addison
we
get
the
oil
money
and
that
not
all
take
a
look
at
this
little
trinket
there
was
a
brief
pause
followed
by
coaten
angry
exclamation
the
marborough
pearls
so
you
stole
them
careful
of
your
words
the
other
warned
your
own
record
is
so
pure
i
never
descended
to
stealing
no
addison
mocked
the
only
difference
is
that
you
tie
your
packages
up
with
legal
red
tape
so
that
no
one
can
pin
anything
on
you
i
use
my
head
stealing
the
marborough
pearls
was
a
stupid
thing
to
do
you
may
go
to
prison
for
it
there
no
risk
the
other
retorted
the
police
did
find
a
single
clue
the
voices
died
away
indicating
that
the
two
men
had
moved
some
distance
from
the
wishing
well
nevertheless
everyone
in
the
ballroom
had
heard
enough
to
realize
that
marborough
priceless
pearls
were
in
the
possession
of
coaten
companion
carl
addison
i
understand
it
all
now
penny
exclaimed
coaten
and
his
friend
must
have
been
standing
outside
the
window
of
the
trailer
that
night
when
rhoda
told
the
breen
family
about
finding
the
pearls
they
probably
heard
the
conversation
i
want
those
two
men
arrested
marborough
announced
in
a
shrill
voice
propelling
her
wheel
chair
toward
the
door
why
does
someone
do
something
spurred
to
action
judge
harlan
instructed
several
men
from
the
group
to
guard
the
estate
exits
accompanied
by
penny
rhoda
louise
in
fact
nearly
every
person
who
had
attended
the
party
he
strode
into
the
yard
to
confront
the
two
conspirators
taken
completely
by
surprise
coaten
and
his
friend
did
not
immediately
understand
the
meaning
of
the
encircling
delegation
your
little
game
is
up
said
penny
thoroughly
savoring
the
moment
we
know
now
that
your
real
reason
for
wanting
to
adopt
rhoda
and
ted
was
to
gain
control
of
valuable
oil
lands
and
you
stole
my
pearl
necklace
accused
marborough
i
want
it
returned
thoroughly
incensed
she
wheeled
her
chair
directly
into
carl
addison
seizing
him
by
the
coat
madam
i
know
nothing
about
your
pearls
the
man
blustered
shaking
loose
from
her
grasp
we
came
to
this
party
only
because
we
were
given
free
tickets
let
get
out
of
here
coaten
said
gruffly
starting
away
it
no
use
penny
interposed
blocking
the
path
we
have
learned
everything
you
see
a
microphone
was
installed
at
the
wishing
well
and
it
carried
your
entire
conversation
into
the
ballroom
for
everyone
to
hear
coaten
and
his
companion
gazing
at
the
unfriendly
faces
encircling
them
realized
that
they
could
not
hope
to
explain
the
situation
away
in
a
sudden
break
for
freedom
carl
addison
ran
to
the
hedge
and
attempted
to
leap
over
it
one
of
the
guards
at
a
nearby
exit
seized
the
man
and
brought
him
back
search
his
pockets
marborough
cried
judge
harlan
did
as
the
widow
demanded
but
the
missing
pearls
were
not
found
on
either
of
the
men
there
you
see
coaten
declared
triumphantly
you
have
falsely
accused
my
friend
penny
suspected
that
addison
had
disposed
of
the
jewel
case
somewhere
near
the
hedge
crossing
to
it
she
groped
about
on
the
ground
after
a
brief
search
her
hand
encountered
a
tiny
box
which
she
knew
must
contain
the
stolen
necklace
returning
with
it
she
displayed
the
pearls
and
presented
them
to
marborough
do
we
need
additional
evidence
to
hold
these
men
she
asked
judge
harlan
anxiously
you
have
produced
more
than
enough
he
replied
turning
to
the
two
culprits
he
said
sternly
i
place
you
both
under
arrest
stand
where
you
are
until
the
police
arrive
and
remember
anything
you
say
may
be
used
against
you
chapter
the
exposure
of
coaten
and
carl
addison
had
been
even
more
dramatic
than
penny
had
dared
hope
it
might
be
she
felt
very
grateful
to
judge
harlan
for
the
vital
information
he
had
provided
regarding
oil
lands
and
especially
for
the
break
of
luck
which
had
made
it
possible
to
regain
marborough
necklace
how
glad
i
am
that
i
never
told
rhoda
i
suspected
ted
of
the
theft
she
thought
i
was
very
unjust
after
the
two
texas
men
had
been
removed
to
jail
by
riverview
police
the
party
went
on
with
more
gaiety
than
before
penny
the
center
of
attention
was
forced
to
tell
over
and
over
how
a
boy
friend
had
assisted
her
in
installing
the
arrangement
in
the
old
wishing
well
i
was
at
all
certain
it
would
work
she
modestly
declared
i
did
hope
that
under
the
proper
conditions
those
two
men
would
talk
and
they
did
you
are
a
very
clever
young
lady
praised
judge
harlan
patting
her
arm
this
will
make
a
nice
story
for
your
father
paper
too
marborough
did
not
try
to
express
in
words
her
appreciation
for
the
recovery
of
the
heirloom
pearls
however
throughout
the
evening
her
worshipful
gaze
followed
penny
wherever
she
went
not
until
refreshments
were
being
served
did
she
have
an
opportunity
to
say
penelope
you
have
brought
me
more
happiness
than
i
deserve
you
and
rhoda
together
now
that
i
have
the
pearls
again
i
be
able
to
carry
out
a
few
of
my
plans
you
remain
in
riverview
penny
asked
eagerly
yes
i
shall
and
i
been
wondering
do
you
suppose
rhoda
and
ted
would
be
willing
to
live
with
me
i
getting
old
while
i
have
money
enough
i
need
someone
why
not
talk
to
rhoda
about
it
i
think
i
shall
marborough
nodded
i
do
it
tonight
penny
was
pleased
a
few
minutes
later
when
rhoda
relayed
the
request
to
her
will
you
agree
to
it
she
asked
the
girl
her
eyes
twinkling
will
i
rhoda
laughed
i
love
rose
acres
and
ted
and
i
will
be
together
again
breen
was
kind
to
us
but
she
has
her
own
family
marborough
needs
someone
to
care
for
her
i
think
the
arrangement
will
be
an
ideal
one
penny
declared
oh
yes
i
meant
to
tell
you
judge
harlan
has
promised
to
look
after
your
legal
interests
with
him
working
on
the
case
those
oil
rights
are
the
same
as
yours
right
now
as
the
night
wore
on
additional
guests
arrived
at
rose
acres
crowding
the
spacious
rooms
nevertheless
shortly
before
midnight
penny
was
surprised
to
see
her
father
car
drive
up
to
the
door
for
she
had
not
expected
him
to
attend
the
party
parker
was
accompanied
by
a
reporter
jerry
livingston
what
brings
you
two
news
hawks
here
penny
asked
running
outside
to
greet
the
newcomers
you
must
have
heard
about
coaten
and
the
pearl
necklace
yes
but
that
not
why
we
came
parker
tersely
replied
been
a
break
in
the
dam
above
cedarville
and
the
river
is
rising
fast
rose
acres
is
in
danger
gasped
penny
the
water
should
come
this
high
but
the
flats
will
be
inundated
within
a
few
minutes
everyone
is
being
warned
to
get
out
fast
we
not
been
able
to
telephone
truman
crocker
jerry
added
his
shack
has
no
can
we
drive
down
there
parker
asked
anxiously
penny
shook
her
head
not
without
going
miles
around
the
quickest
way
is
to
take
the
trail
at
the
rear
of
this
property
wait
i
show
you
darting
into
the
house
for
a
coat
she
led
her
father
and
jerry
to
the
hillside
then
deciding
to
accompany
them
she
went
on
ahead
down
the
steep
incline
there
a
light
burning
in
the
shack
parker
observed
a
few
minutes
later
crocker
must
be
up
reaching
the
building
the
editor
thumped
once
on
the
door
of
the
workshop
and
then
pushed
it
open
truman
crocker
was
busy
at
his
bench
startled
by
the
unexpected
intrusion
of
the
three
visitors
he
backed
a
few
steps
away
from
them
you
ca
do
nothin
to
me
he
mumbled
all
i
did
was
what
i
was
told
to
do
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
parker
cut
him
short
we
here
to
warn
you
the
dam
at
cedarville
has
let
go
and
the
river
is
rising
fast
the
river
the
stonecutter
faltered
for
a
fleeting
instant
the
man
gaze
had
roved
toward
a
large
object
covered
with
a
piece
of
canvas
as
crocker
words
came
back
to
penny
she
suddenly
knew
why
he
had
been
so
startled
to
see
her
father
impulsively
she
darted
across
the
room
and
jerked
the
canvas
from
the
object
it
covered
revealed
for
all
to
see
was
a
large
rounded
rock
bearing
a
carving
which
had
not
been
completed
a
record
stone
she
cried
truman
crocker
you
are
the
one
who
planted
those
fakes
you
been
hired
by
someone
no
no
the
man
denied
cringing
away
parker
strode
across
the
room
and
one
glance
at
the
rock
penny
had
uncovered
convinced
him
that
his
daughter
accusation
was
a
sound
one
obviously
the
stone
had
been
treated
with
acid
and
chemicals
to
give
it
an
appearance
of
great
age
several
indian
figures
remained
uncompleted
who
hired
you
he
demanded
of
truman
crocker
tell
the
truth
i
ai
tellin
nothing
the
stonecutter
returned
sullenly
then
you
go
to
jail
parker
retorted
you
been
a
party
to
a
fraud
it
was
the
publicity
agent
of
the
indian
show
who
hired
you
he
probably
gave
you
a
hundred
dollars
for
the
job
not
that
much
crocker
muttered
an
you
ca
send
me
to
jail
because
all
i
did
was
fix
the
stones
and
put
where
he
told
me
you
wo
go
to
jail
if
you
testify
to
the
truth
parker
assured
him
all
you
have
to
do
is
tell
what
you
know
i
ai
going
to
tell
nothing
crocker
said
sullenly
moving
so
quickly
that
both
jerry
and
parker
were
caught
off
guard
he
wheeled
and
ran
out
the
open
door
get
him
the
editor
barked
unless
he
testify
against
bill
mcjavins
we
may
lose
a
big
story
penny
waited
anxiously
at
the
shack
while
her
father
and
jerry
pursued
the
fleeing
man
ten
minutes
later
they
stumbled
back
completely
winded
to
report
their
failure
the
laborer
had
hidden
somewhere
among
the
bushes
dotting
the
hillside
and
they
could
not
hope
to
find
him
without
crocker
story
we
have
no
more
evidence
than
we
ever
had
parker
declared
in
disgust
penny
tapped
the
big
rock
with
the
carving
you
have
this
stone
dad
if
you
could
photograph
it
in
this
unfinished
state
it
tell
its
own
story
we
have
no
camera
here
and
the
river
is
rising
fast
how
long
would
it
take
you
to
get
to
town
and
back
jerry
i
might
make
it
in
thirty
minutes
before
that
time
this
shack
will
be
under
water
anxiously
parker
gazed
at
the
dark
angry
flood
which
swept
so
close
to
the
door
of
the
cabin
inch
by
inch
it
was
eating
away
a
board
walk
which
led
to
a
pier
and
a
boat
tied
to
it
dad
penny
suddenly
cried
if
only
we
could
get
this
stone
into
the
boat
we
could
float
it
to
riverview
not
a
chance
parker
returned
briefly
both
would
sink
we
completely
out
of
luck
added
jerry
at
the
rate
the
water
is
coming
up
this
shack
will
be
awash
in
another
fifteen
minutes
dad
penny
went
on
determinedly
if
we
could
make
a
heavy
raft
could
the
stone
be
floated
it
might
be
towed
behind
the
boat
a
raft
there
nothing
from
which
to
make
one
yes
there
is
penny
pointed
to
several
barrels
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
shop
it
an
idea
cried
jerry
we
have
crocker
tools
this
story
means
a
lot
to
you
chief
is
it
worth
a
try
maybe
it
is
parker
conceded
and
then
with
sudden
enthusiasm
let
get
to
work
by
moving
fast
we
may
yet
outwit
old
man
river
chapter
working
with
feverish
haste
parker
and
jerry
constructed
a
raft
of
eight
empty
barrels
wiring
them
together
into
one
solid
unit
penny
aided
the
two
men
as
best
she
could
holding
tools
and
offering
suggestions
which
were
not
especially
appreciated
run
outside
and
see
that
the
boat
is
all
right
parker
instructed
her
we
must
let
it
float
away
obeying
penny
discovered
that
already
the
river
was
flowing
in
a
shallow
muddy
stream
over
the
pier
the
swift
current
tugged
at
the
underpinning
threatening
to
carry
it
away
wading
through
the
water
she
reached
the
boat
and
drew
it
close
to
the
shack
where
she
retied
it
by
the
time
she
finished
her
father
and
jerry
had
completed
the
raft
how
will
you
ever
get
the
stone
on
it
penny
asked
anxiously
it
must
weigh
several
hundred
pounds
just
watch
grinned
jerry
during
penny
absence
he
and
parker
had
constructed
a
small
square
platform
of
rough
boards
equipped
with
four
tiny
rollers
getting
the
stone
on
it
they
were
able
to
trundle
it
outside
to
the
raft
with
a
minimum
of
exertion
now
dump
her
on
easy
parker
ordered
jerry
if
she
sinks
our
story
sinks
too
together
they
rolled
the
heavy
stone
from
the
platform
to
the
raft
which
immediately
began
to
settle
beneath
the
great
weight
it
going
under
penny
screamed
as
the
three
watched
anxiously
the
raft
steadied
and
rode
just
beneath
the
surface
of
the
water
she
floats
jerry
cried
jubilantly
now
unless
we
have
an
upset
or
strike
an
object
in
the
river
we
should
make
it
to
the
adams
street
pier
we
have
a
paper
truck
meet
us
there
and
haul
the
rock
to
the
newspaper
plant
parker
added
with
satisfaction
let
shove
off
penny
had
untied
the
rowboat
however
as
she
prepared
to
step
into
it
her
father
pulled
her
back
this
little
trip
is
for
you
penny
we
might
upset
do
be
ridiculous
dad
she
argued
you
know
very
well
i
can
swim
circles
around
you
if
the
boat
does
go
under
you
be
glad
to
have
me
along
maybe
you
right
the
editor
conceded
jump
in
water
was
flowing
over
the
floor
of
the
crocker
shack
as
the
boat
and
the
cumbersome
raft
started
downstream
jerry
who
had
elected
to
steer
found
himself
hard
pressed
to
keep
the
prow
nosing
into
the
waves
parker
pulled
without
much
enthusiasm
at
an
extra
oar
supplied
him
content
to
allow
the
swift
current
to
do
most
of
the
work
is
it
fun
penny
demanded
snuggling
close
to
her
father
just
look
at
the
beautiful
stars
look
at
the
river
parker
retorted
do
you
realize
that
if
we
should
strike
a
floating
object
if
that
big
rock
should
shift
and
see
the
lovely
moon
penny
went
on
dreamily
i
think
it
laughing
at
the
joke
we
going
to
play
on
jay
franklin
in
the
morning
that
old
coot
will
get
a
shock
when
he
reads
the
parker
admitted
relaxing
so
will
the
publicity
agent
of
the
indian
show
when
i
get
through
the
outfit
wo
dare
put
on
a
performance
in
riverview
do
you
suppose
franklin
had
any
part
in
hiring
truman
crocker
to
fake
those
record
stones
jerry
asked
steering
to
avoid
a
floating
box
not
in
my
opinion
the
editor
replied
he
merely
thought
he
would
profit
by
selling
them
to
the
museum
at
a
fancy
price
it
was
immaterial
to
him
whether
or
not
he
sold
fake
stones
or
real
you
certainly
ruin
his
little
business
transaction
chuckled
penny
what
will
be
done
about
truman
crocker
we
find
him
tomorrow
and
force
him
to
tell
the
truth
that
he
was
hired
by
bill
mcjavins
with
this
stone
as
evidence
he
ca
deny
his
part
in
the
hoax
ca
you
just
see
that
special
edition
of
the
penny
asked
gaily
a
big
splashy
picture
of
this
pilgrim
rock
we
towing
with
a
story
telling
how
truman
crocker
faked
the
writing
then
in
the
next
column
a
yarn
about
addison
arrest
and
the
recovery
of
the
marborough
pearls
it
will
be
a
real
paper
parker
agreed
heartily
by
the
way
how
were
coaten
and
carl
addison
trapped
our
reporter
got
the
story
from
the
police
but
he
was
a
bit
vague
on
that
point
i
far
too
modest
to
tell
you
penny
laughed
if
you
willing
to
pay
me
at
regular
space
rates
i
might
be
induced
to
write
the
story
trust
penny
to
drive
a
hard
bargain
grinned
jerry
we
might
have
guessed
who
was
responsible
for
she
never
fails
to
be
on
hand
for
the
final
penny
smiled
as
she
gazed
down
the
dark
turbulent
river
close
by
she
heard
the
whistle
of
a
tug
boat
along
the
bank
tall
buildings
began
to
appear
and
far
ahead
she
could
see
the
twinkling
lights
on
the
adams
street
pier
we
worked
on
some
dandy
stories
together
she
murmured
but
this
one
tops
them
all
for
a
thrilling
finish
marborough
regained
her
pearls
rhoda
won
a
home
the
two
men
from
texas
are
behind
bars
and
the
wishing
well
is
equipped
with
a
brand
new
microphone
you
know
i
like
to
make
one
more
wish
down
its
moist
old
throat
what
would
you
ask
for
this
time
jerry
asked
banteringly
a
safe
arrival
in
port
penny
shook
her
head
we
almost
at
the
pier
now
i
wish
that
hunk
of
granite
would
turn
into
a
lump
of
pure
gold
then
i
truly
feel
as
if
i
were
the
captain
of
a
treasure
ship
sailing
home
with
precious
cargo
oh
i
would
ask
for
a
better
cargo
than
we
have
right
here
parker
responded
heartily
at
this
moment
i
would
rather
have
our
old
rock
than
all
the
gold
in
the
world
transcriber
notes
replaced
the
list
of
books
in
the
series
by
the
complete
list
as
in
the
final
book
the
cry
at
midnight
silently
corrected
a
handful
of
palpable
typos
