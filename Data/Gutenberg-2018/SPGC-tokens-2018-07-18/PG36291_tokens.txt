chapter
i
my
father
in
proportion
as
he
grew
old
and
rich
became
weary
of
aleppo
his
natal
soil
had
it
been
the
haunt
of
calmucks
or
bedouins
his
fancy
would
have
transformed
into
paradise
no
wonder
that
the
equitable
aristocracy
and
the
peaceful
husbandmen
of
ragusa
should
be
endeared
to
his
heart
by
comparison
with
egyptian
plagues
and
turkish
tyranny
besides
he
lived
for
his
children
as
well
as
himself
their
education
and
future
lot
required
him
to
seek
a
permanent
home
he
embarked
with
his
wife
and
offspring
at
scanderoon
no
immediate
conveyance
to
ragusa
offering
the
appearance
of
the
plague
in
syria
induced
him
to
hasten
his
departure
he
entered
a
french
vessel
for
marseilles
after
being
three
days
at
sea
one
of
the
crew
was
seized
by
the
fatal
disease
which
had
depopulated
all
the
towns
upon
the
coast
the
voyage
was
made
with
more
than
usual
despatch
but
before
we
reached
our
port
my
mother
and
half
the
crew
perished
my
father
died
in
the
lazaretto
more
through
grief
than
disease
my
brother
and
i
were
children
and
helpless
my
father
fortune
was
on
board
this
vessel
and
was
left
by
his
death
to
the
mercy
of
the
captain
this
man
was
honest
and
consigned
us
and
our
property
to
the
merchant
with
whom
he
dealt
happily
for
us
our
protector
was
childless
and
of
scrupulous
integrity
we
henceforth
became
his
adopted
children
my
brother
education
and
my
own
were
conducted
on
the
justest
principles
at
the
end
of
four
years
our
protector
found
it
expedient
to
make
a
voyage
to
cayenne
his
brother
was
an
extensive
proprietor
in
that
colony
but
his
sudden
death
made
way
for
the
succession
of
our
friend
to
establish
his
claims
his
presence
was
necessary
on
the
spot
he
was
little
qualified
for
arduous
enterprises
and
his
age
demanded
repose
but
his
own
acquisitions
having
been
small
and
being
desirous
of
leaving
us
in
possession
of
competence
he
cheerfully
embarked
meanwhile
my
brother
was
placed
at
a
celebrated
seminary
in
the
pays
de
vaud
and
i
was
sent
to
a
sister
who
resided
at
verona
i
was
at
this
time
fourteen
years
old
one
year
younger
than
my
brother
whom
since
that
period
i
have
neither
heard
of
nor
seen
i
was
now
a
woman
and
qualified
to
judge
and
act
for
myself
the
character
of
my
new
friend
was
austere
and
devout
and
there
were
so
many
incongenial
points
between
us
that
but
little
tranquillity
was
enjoyed
under
her
control
the
priest
who
discharged
the
office
of
her
confessor
thought
proper
to
entertain
views
with
regard
to
me
grossly
inconsistent
with
the
sanctity
of
his
profession
he
was
a
man
of
profound
dissimulation
and
masterly
address
his
efforts
however
were
repelled
with
disdain
my
security
against
his
attempts
lay
in
the
uncouthness
and
deformity
which
nature
had
bestowed
upon
his
person
and
visage
rather
than
in
the
firmness
of
my
own
principles
the
courtship
of
father
bartoli
the
austerities
of
madame
roselli
the
disgustful
or
insipid
occupations
to
which
i
was
condemned
made
me
impatiently
wish
for
a
change
but
my
father
so
i
will
call
him
had
decreed
that
i
should
remain
under
his
sister
guardianship
till
his
return
from
guiana
when
this
would
happen
was
uncertain
events
unforeseen
might
protract
it
for
years
but
it
could
not
arrive
in
less
than
a
twelvemonth
i
was
incessantly
preyed
upon
by
discontent
my
solitude
was
loathsome
i
panted
after
liberty
and
friendship
and
the
want
of
these
were
not
recompensed
by
luxury
and
quiet
and
by
the
instructions
in
useful
science
which
i
received
from
bartoli
who
though
detested
as
a
hypocrite
and
lover
was
venerable
as
a
scholar
he
would
fain
have
been
an
abelard
but
it
was
not
his
fate
to
meet
with
an
eloisa
two
years
passed
away
in
this
durance
my
miseries
were
exquisite
i
am
almost
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
unhappiness
of
that
time
for
looking
back
upon
it
i
perceive
that
an
equal
period
could
not
have
been
spent
with
more
benefit
for
the
sake
of
being
near
me
bartoli
importunately
offered
his
instructions
he
had
nothing
to
communicate
but
metaphysics
and
geometry
these
were
little
to
my
taste
but
i
could
not
keep
him
at
a
distance
i
had
no
other
alternative
than
to
endure
him
as
a
lover
or
a
teacher
his
passion
for
science
was
at
least
equal
to
that
which
ho
entertained
for
me
and
both
these
passions
combined
to
make
him
a
sedulous
instructor
he
was
a
disciple
of
the
newest
doctrines
respecting
matter
and
mind
he
denied
the
impenetrability
of
the
first
and
the
immateriality
of
the
second
these
he
endeavoured
to
inculcate
upon
me
as
well
as
to
subvert
my
religious
tenets
because
he
delighted
like
all
men
in
transfusing
his
opinions
and
because
he
regarded
my
piety
as
the
only
obstacle
to
his
designs
he
succeeded
in
dissolving
the
spell
of
ignorance
but
not
in
producing
that
kind
of
acquiescence
he
wished
he
had
in
this
respect
to
struggle
not
only
with
my
principles
but
my
weakness
he
might
have
overcome
every
obstacle
but
my
abhorrence
of
deformity
and
age
to
cure
me
of
this
aversion
was
beyond
his
power
my
servitude
grew
daily
more
painful
i
grew
tired
of
chasing
a
comet
to
its
aphelion
and
of
untying
the
knot
of
an
infinite
series
a
change
in
my
condition
became
indispensable
to
my
very
existence
languor
and
sadness
and
unwillingness
to
eat
or
to
move
were
at
last
my
perpetual
attendants
madame
roselli
was
alarmed
at
my
condition
the
sources
of
my
inquietude
were
incomprehensible
to
her
the
truth
was
that
i
scarcely
understood
them
myself
and
my
endeavours
to
explain
them
to
my
friend
merely
instilled
into
her
an
opinion
that
i
was
either
lunatic
or
deceitful
she
complained
and
admonished
but
my
disinclination
to
my
usual
employments
would
not
be
conquered
and
my
health
rapidly
declined
a
physician
who
was
called
confessed
that
my
case
was
beyond
his
power
to
understand
but
recommended
as
a
sort
of
desperate
expedient
a
change
of
scene
a
succession
and
variety
of
objects
might
possibly
contribute
to
my
cure
at
this
time
there
arrived
at
verona
lady
an
englishwoman
of
fortune
and
rank
and
a
strenuous
catholic
her
husband
had
lately
died
and
in
order
to
divert
her
grief
as
well
as
to
gratify
her
curiosity
in
viewing
the
great
seat
of
her
religion
she
had
come
to
italy
intercourse
took
place
between
her
and
madame
roselli
by
this
means
she
gained
a
knowledge
of
my
person
and
condition
and
kindly
offered
to
take
me
under
her
protection
she
meant
to
traverse
every
part
of
italy
and
was
willing
that
i
should
accompany
her
in
all
her
wanderings
this
offer
was
gratefully
accepted
in
spite
of
the
artifices
and
remonstrances
of
bartoli
my
companion
speedily
contracted
for
me
the
affection
of
a
mother
she
was
without
kindred
of
her
own
religion
having
acquired
her
faith
not
by
inheritance
but
conversion
she
desired
to
abjure
her
native
country
and
to
bind
herself
by
every
social
tie
to
a
people
who
adhered
to
the
same
faith
me
she
promised
to
adopt
as
her
daughter
provided
her
first
impressions
in
my
favour
were
not
belied
by
my
future
deportment
my
principles
were
opposite
to
hers
but
habit
an
aversion
to
displease
my
friend
my
passion
for
knowledge
which
my
new
condition
enabled
me
to
gratify
all
combined
to
make
me
a
deceiver
but
my
imposture
was
merely
of
a
negative
kind
i
deceived
her
rather
by
forbearance
to
contradict
and
by
acting
as
she
acted
than
by
open
assent
and
zealous
concurrence
my
new
state
was
on
this
account
not
devoid
of
inconvenience
the
general
deportment
and
sentiments
of
lady
testified
a
vigorous
and
pure
mind
new
avenues
to
knowledge
by
converse
with
mankind
and
with
books
and
by
the
survey
of
new
scenes
were
open
for
my
use
gratitude
and
veneration
attached
me
to
my
friend
and
made
the
task
of
pleasing
her
by
a
seeming
conformity
of
sentiments
less
irksome
during
this
interval
no
tidings
were
received
by
his
sister
at
verona
respecting
the
fate
of
sebastian
roselli
the
supposition
of
his
death
was
too
plausible
not
to
be
adopted
what
influence
this
disaster
possessed
over
my
brother
destiny
i
know
not
the
generosity
of
lady
hindered
me
from
experiencing
any
disadvantage
from
this
circumstance
fortune
seemed
to
have
decreed
that
i
should
not
be
reduced
to
the
condition
of
an
orphan
at
an
age
and
in
a
situation
like
mine
i
could
not
remain
long
unacquainted
with
love
my
abode
at
rome
introduced
me
to
the
knowledge
of
a
youth
from
england
who
had
every
property
which
i
regarded
as
worthy
of
esteem
he
was
a
kinsman
of
lady
and
as
such
admitted
at
her
house
on
the
most
familiar
footing
his
patrimony
was
extremely
slender
but
was
in
his
own
possession
he
had
no
intention
of
increasing
it
by
any
professional
pursuit
but
was
contented
with
the
frugal
provision
it
afforded
he
proposed
no
other
end
of
his
existence
than
the
acquisition
of
virtue
and
knowledge
the
property
of
lady
was
subject
to
her
own
disposal
but
on
the
failure
of
a
testament
this
youth
was
in
legal
succession
the
next
heir
he
was
well
acquainted
with
her
temper
and
views
but
in
the
midst
of
urbanity
and
gentleness
studied
none
of
those
concealments
of
opinion
which
would
have
secured
him
her
favour
that
he
was
not
of
her
own
faith
was
an
insuperable
but
the
only
obstacle
to
the
admission
of
his
claims
if
conformity
of
age
and
opinions
and
the
mutual
fascination
of
love
be
a
suitable
basis
for
marriage
wentworth
and
i
were
destined
for
each
other
mutual
disclosure
added
sanctity
to
our
affection
but
the
happiness
of
lady
being
made
to
depend
upon
the
dissolution
of
our
compact
the
heroism
of
wentworth
made
him
hasten
to
dissolve
it
as
soon
as
she
discovered
our
attachment
she
displayed
symptoms
of
the
deepest
anguish
in
addition
to
religious
motives
her
fondness
for
me
forbade
her
to
exist
but
in
my
society
and
in
the
belief
of
the
purity
of
my
faith
the
contention
on
my
part
was
vehement
between
the
regards
due
to
her
felicity
and
to
my
own
had
wentworth
left
me
the
power
to
decide
my
decision
would
doubtless
have
evinced
the
frailty
of
my
fortitude
and
the
strength
of
my
passion
but
having
informed
me
fully
of
the
reasons
of
his
conduct
he
precipitately
retired
from
rome
he
left
me
no
means
of
tracing
his
footsteps
and
of
assailing
his
weakness
by
expostulation
and
entreaty
lady
was
no
less
eager
to
abandon
a
spot
where
her
happiness
had
been
so
imminently
endangered
our
next
residence
was
palermo
i
will
not
dwell
upon
the
sensations
produced
by
this
disappointment
in
me
i
review
them
with
astonishment
and
if
i
thought
it
possible
for
me
to
sink
again
into
imbecility
so
ignominious
i
should
be
disposed
to
kill
myself
there
was
no
end
to
vows
of
fondness
and
tokens
of
gratitude
in
lady
her
future
life
should
be
devoted
to
compensate
me
for
this
sacrifice
nothing
could
console
her
in
that
single
state
in
which
she
intended
to
live
but
the
consolations
of
my
fellowship
her
conduct
coincided
for
some
time
with
these
professions
and
my
anguish
was
allayed
by
the
contemplation
of
the
happiness
conferred
upon
one
whom
i
revered
my
friend
could
not
be
charged
with
dissimulation
and
artifice
her
character
had
been
mistaken
by
herself
as
well
as
by
me
devout
affections
seemed
to
have
filled
her
heart
to
the
exclusion
of
any
object
besides
myself
she
cherished
with
romantic
tenderness
the
memory
of
her
husband
and
imagined
that
a
single
state
was
indispensably
enjoined
upon
her
by
religious
duty
this
persuasion
however
was
subverted
by
the
arts
of
a
spanish
cavalier
young
opulent
and
romantic
as
herself
in
devotion
an
event
like
this
might
indeed
have
been
easily
predicted
by
those
who
reflected
that
the
lady
was
still
in
the
bloom
of
life
ardent
in
her
temper
and
bewitching
in
her
manners
the
fondness
she
had
lavished
upon
me
was
now
in
some
degree
transferred
to
a
new
object
but
i
still
received
the
treatment
due
to
a
beloved
daughter
she
was
solicitous
as
ever
to
promote
my
gratification
and
a
diminution
of
kindness
would
not
have
been
suspected
by
those
who
had
not
witnessed
the
excesses
of
her
former
passion
her
marriage
with
the
spaniard
removed
the
obstacle
to
union
with
wentworth
this
man
however
had
set
himself
beyond
the
reach
of
my
inquiries
had
there
been
the
shadow
of
a
clue
afforded
me
i
should
certainly
have
sought
him
to
the
ends
of
the
world
i
continued
to
reside
with
my
friend
and
accompanied
her
and
her
husband
to
spain
antonio
de
leyva
was
a
man
of
probity
his
mind
was
enlightened
by
knowledge
and
his
actions
dictated
by
humanity
though
but
little
older
than
myself
and
young
enough
to
be
the
son
of
his
spouse
his
deportment
to
me
was
a
model
of
rectitude
and
delicacy
i
spent
a
year
in
spain
partly
in
the
mountains
of
castile
and
partly
at
segovia
new
manners
and
a
new
language
occupied
my
attention
for
a
time
but
these
losing
their
novelty
lost
their
power
to
please
i
betook
myself
to
books
to
beguile
the
tediousness
and
diversify
the
tenor
of
my
life
this
would
not
have
long
availed
but
i
was
relieved
from
new
repinings
by
the
appointment
of
antonio
de
leyva
to
a
diplomatic
office
at
vienna
thither
we
accordingly
repaired
a
coincidence
of
circumstances
had
led
me
wide
from
the
path
of
ambition
and
study
usually
allotted
to
my
sex
and
age
from
the
computation
of
eclipses
i
now
betook
myself
to
the
study
of
man
my
proficiency
when
i
allowed
it
to
be
seen
attracted
great
attention
instead
of
adulation
and
gallantry
i
was
engaged
in
watching
the
conduct
of
states
and
revolving
the
theories
of
politicians
superficial
observers
were
either
incredulous
with
regard
to
my
character
or
connected
a
stupid
wonder
with
their
belief
my
attainments
and
habits
they
did
not
see
to
be
perfectly
consonant
with
the
principles
of
human
nature
they
unavoidably
flowed
from
the
illicit
attachment
of
bartoli
and
the
erring
magnanimity
of
wentworth
aversion
to
the
priest
was
the
grand
inciter
of
my
former
studies
the
love
of
wentworth
whom
i
hoped
once
more
to
meet
made
me
labour
to
exclude
the
importunities
of
others
and
to
qualify
myself
for
securing
his
affections
since
our
parting
in
italy
wentworth
had
traversed
syria
and
egypt
and
arrived
some
months
after
me
at
vienna
he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
city
when
accident
informed
me
of
his
being
there
an
interview
was
effected
and
our
former
sentiments
respecting
each
other
having
undergone
no
change
we
were
united
madame
de
leyva
reluctantly
concurred
with
our
wishes
and
at
parting
forced
upon
me
a
considerable
sum
of
money
wentworth
was
a
character
not
frequently
met
with
in
the
world
he
was
a
political
enthusiast
who
esteemed
nothing
more
graceful
or
glorious
than
to
die
for
the
liberties
of
mankind
he
had
traversed
greece
with
an
imagination
full
of
the
exploits
of
ancient
times
and
derived
from
contemplating
thermopylæ
and
marathon
an
enthusiasm
that
bordered
upon
frenzy
it
was
now
the
third
year
of
the
revolutionary
war
in
america
and
previous
to
our
meeting
at
vienna
he
had
formed
the
resolution
of
repairing
thither
and
tendering
his
service
to
the
congress
as
a
volunteer
our
marriage
made
no
change
in
his
plans
my
soul
was
engrossed
by
two
passions
a
wild
spirit
of
adventure
and
a
boundless
devotion
to
him
i
vowed
to
accompany
him
in
every
danger
to
vie
with
him
in
military
ardour
to
combat
and
to
die
by
his
side
i
delighted
to
assume
the
male
dress
to
acquire
skill
at
the
sword
and
dexterity
in
every
boisterous
exercise
the
timidity
that
commonly
attends
women
gradually
vanished
i
felt
as
if
imbued
by
a
soul
that
was
a
stranger
to
the
sexual
distinction
we
embarked
at
brest
in
a
frigate
destined
for
domingo
a
desperate
conflict
with
an
english
ship
in
the
bay
of
biscay
was
my
first
introduction
to
a
scene
of
tumult
and
danger
of
whose
true
nature
i
had
formed
no
previous
conception
at
first
i
was
spiritless
and
full
of
dismay
experience
however
gradually
reconciled
me
to
the
life
that
i
had
chosen
a
fortunate
shot
by
dismasting
the
enemy
allowed
us
to
prosecute
our
voyage
unmolested
at
cape
françois
we
found
a
ship
which
transported
us
after
various
perils
to
richmond
in
virginia
i
will
not
carry
you
through
the
adventures
of
four
years
you
sitting
all
your
life
in
peaceful
corners
can
scarcely
imagine
that
variety
of
hardship
and
turmoil
which
attends
the
female
who
lives
in
a
camp
few
would
sustain
these
hardships
with
better
grace
than
i
did
i
could
seldom
be
prevailed
on
to
remain
at
a
distance
and
inactive
when
my
husband
was
in
battle
and
more
than
once
rescued
him
from
death
by
the
seasonable
destruction
of
his
adversary
at
the
repulse
of
the
americans
at
germantown
wentworth
was
wounded
and
taken
prisoner
i
obtained
permission
to
attend
his
and
supply
that
care
without
which
he
would
assuredly
have
died
being
imperfectly
recovered
he
was
sent
to
england
and
subjected
to
a
rigorous
imprisonment
milder
treatment
might
have
permitted
his
complete
restoration
to
health
but
as
it
was
he
died
his
kindred
were
noble
and
rich
and
powerful
but
it
was
difficult
to
make
them
acquainted
with
wentworth
situation
their
assistance
when
demanded
was
readily
afforded
but
it
came
too
late
to
prevent
his
death
me
they
snatched
from
my
voluntary
prison
and
employed
every
friendly
art
to
efface
from
my
mind
the
images
of
recent
calamity
wentworth
singularities
of
conduct
and
opinion
had
estranged
him
at
an
early
age
from
his
family
they
felt
little
regret
at
his
fate
but
every
motive
concurred
to
secure
their
affection
and
succour
to
me
my
character
was
known
to
many
officers
returned
from
america
whose
report
joined
with
the
influence
of
my
conversation
rendered
me
an
object
to
be
gazed
at
by
thousands
strange
vicissitude
now
immersed
in
the
infection
of
a
military
hospital
the
sport
of
a
wayward
fortune
struggling
with
cold
and
hunger
with
negligence
and
contumely
a
month
after
passing
into
scenes
of
gayety
and
luxury
exhibited
at
operas
and
masquerades
made
the
theme
of
inquiry
and
encomium
at
every
place
of
resort
and
caressed
by
the
most
illustrious
among
the
votaries
of
science
and
the
advocates
of
the
american
cause
here
i
again
met
madame
de
leyva
this
woman
was
perpetually
assuming
new
forms
she
was
a
sincere
convert
to
the
catholic
religion
but
she
was
open
to
every
new
impression
she
was
the
dupe
of
every
powerful
reasoner
and
assumed
with
equal
facility
the
most
opposite
shapes
she
had
again
reverted
to
the
protestant
religion
and
governed
by
a
headlong
zeal
in
whatever
cause
she
engaged
she
had
sacrificed
her
husband
and
child
to
a
new
conviction
the
instrument
of
this
change
was
a
man
who
passed
at
that
time
for
a
frenchman
he
was
young
accomplished
and
addressful
but
was
not
suspected
of
having
been
prompted
by
illicit
views
or
of
having
seduced
the
lady
from
allegiance
to
her
husband
as
well
as
to
her
god
de
leyva
however
who
was
sincere
in
his
religion
as
well
as
his
love
was
hasty
to
avenge
this
injury
and
in
a
contest
with
the
frenchman
was
killed
his
wife
adopted
at
once
her
ancient
religion
and
country
and
was
once
more
an
englishwoman
at
our
meeting
her
affection
for
me
seemed
to
be
revived
and
the
most
passionate
entreaties
were
used
to
detain
me
in
england
my
previous
arrangements
would
not
suffer
it
i
foresaw
restraints
and
inconveniences
from
the
violence
and
caprice
of
her
passions
and
intended
henceforth
to
keep
my
liberty
inviolate
by
any
species
of
engagement
either
of
friendship
or
marriage
my
habits
were
french
and
i
proposed
henceforward
to
take
up
my
abode
at
paris
since
his
voyage
to
guiana
i
had
heard
no
tidings
of
sebastian
roselli
this
man
image
was
cherished
with
filial
emotions
and
i
conceived
that
the
sight
of
him
would
amply
reward
a
longer
journey
than
from
london
to
marseilles
beyond
my
hopes
i
found
him
in
his
ancient
abode
the
voyage
and
a
residence
of
three
years
at
cayenne
had
been
beneficial
to
his
appearance
and
health
he
greeted
me
with
paternal
tenderness
and
admitted
me
to
a
full
participation
of
his
fortune
which
the
sale
of
his
american
property
had
greatly
enhanced
he
was
a
stranger
to
the
fate
of
my
brother
on
his
return
home
he
had
gone
to
switzerland
with
a
view
of
ascertaining
his
destiny
the
youth
a
few
months
after
his
arrival
at
lausanne
had
eloped
with
a
companion
and
had
hitherto
eluded
all
roselli
searches
and
inquiries
my
father
was
easily
prevailed
upon
to
transfer
his
residence
from
provence
to
paris
here
martinette
paused
and
marking
the
clock
it
is
time
resumed
she
to
begone
are
you
not
weary
of
my
tale
on
the
day
i
entered
france
i
entered
the
year
of
my
age
so
that
my
promise
of
detailing
my
youthful
adventures
is
fulfilled
i
must
away
till
we
meet
again
farewell
chapter
ii
such
was
the
wild
series
of
martinette
adventures
each
incident
fastened
on
the
memory
of
constantia
and
gave
birth
to
numberless
reflections
her
prospect
of
mankind
seemed
to
be
enlarged
on
a
sudden
to
double
its
ancient
dimensions
ormond
narratives
had
carried
her
beyond
the
mississippi
and
into
the
deserts
of
siberia
he
had
recounted
the
perils
of
a
russian
war
and
painted
the
manners
of
mongols
and
naudowessies
her
new
friend
had
led
her
back
to
the
civilized
world
and
portrayed
the
other
half
of
the
species
men
in
their
two
forms
of
savage
and
refined
had
been
scrutinized
by
these
observers
and
what
was
wanting
in
the
delineations
of
the
one
was
liberally
supplied
by
the
other
eleven
years
in
the
life
of
martinette
was
unrelated
her
conversation
suggested
the
opinion
that
this
interval
had
been
spent
in
france
it
was
obvious
to
suppose
that
a
woman
thus
fearless
and
sagacious
had
not
been
inactive
at
a
period
like
the
present
which
called
forth
talents
and
courage
without
distinction
of
sex
and
had
been
particularly
distinguished
by
female
enterprise
and
heroism
her
name
easily
led
to
the
suspicion
of
concurrence
with
the
subverters
of
monarchy
and
of
participation
in
their
fall
her
flight
from
the
merciless
tribunals
of
the
faction
that
now
reigned
would
explain
present
appearances
martinette
brought
to
their
next
interview
an
air
of
uncommon
exultation
on
this
being
remarked
she
communicated
the
tidings
of
the
fall
of
the
sanguinary
tyranny
of
robespierre
her
eyes
sparkled
and
every
feature
was
pregnant
with
delight
while
she
unfolded
with
her
accustomed
energy
the
particulars
of
this
tremendous
revolution
the
blood
which
it
occasioned
to
flow
was
mentioned
without
any
symptoms
of
disgust
or
horror
constantia
ventured
to
ask
if
this
incident
was
likely
to
influence
her
own
condition
yes
it
will
open
the
way
for
my
return
then
you
think
of
returning
to
a
scene
of
so
much
danger
danger
my
girl
it
is
my
element
i
am
an
adorer
of
liberty
and
liberty
without
peril
can
never
exist
but
so
much
bloodshed
and
injustice
does
not
your
heart
shrink
from
the
view
of
a
scene
of
massacre
and
tumult
such
as
paris
has
lately
exhibited
and
will
probably
continue
to
exhibit
thou
talkest
constantia
in
a
way
scarcely
worthy
of
thy
good
sense
have
i
not
been
three
years
in
a
camp
what
are
bleeding
wounds
and
mangled
corpses
when
accustomed
to
the
daily
sight
of
them
for
years
am
i
not
a
lover
of
liberty
and
must
i
not
exult
in
the
fall
of
tyrants
and
regret
only
that
my
hand
had
no
share
in
their
destruction
but
a
woman
how
can
the
heart
of
woman
be
inured
to
the
shedding
of
blood
have
women
i
beseech
thee
no
capacity
to
reason
and
infer
are
they
less
open
than
men
to
the
influence
of
habit
my
hand
never
faltered
when
liberty
demanded
the
victim
if
thou
wert
with
me
at
paris
i
could
show
thee
a
fusil
of
two
barrels
which
is
precious
beyond
any
other
relic
merely
because
it
enabled
me
to
kill
thirteen
officers
at
jemappe
two
of
these
were
emigrant
nobles
whom
i
knew
and
loved
before
the
revolution
but
the
cause
they
had
since
espoused
cancelled
their
claims
to
mercy
what
said
the
startled
constantia
have
you
fought
in
the
ranks
certainly
hundreds
of
my
sex
have
done
the
same
some
were
impelled
by
the
enthusiasm
of
love
and
some
by
a
mere
passion
for
war
some
by
the
contagion
of
example
and
some
with
whom
i
myself
must
be
ranked
by
a
generous
devotion
to
liberty
brunswick
and
had
to
contend
with
whole
regiments
of
women
regiments
they
would
have
formed
if
they
had
been
collected
into
separate
bodies
i
will
tell
thee
a
secret
thou
wouldst
never
have
seen
martinette
de
beauvais
if
brunswick
had
deferred
one
day
longer
his
orders
for
retreating
into
germany
how
so
she
would
have
died
by
her
own
hand
what
could
lead
to
such
an
outrage
the
love
of
liberty
i
can
not
comprehend
how
that
love
should
prompt
you
to
suicide
i
will
tell
thee
the
plan
was
formed
and
could
not
miscarry
a
woman
was
to
play
the
part
of
a
banished
royalist
was
to
repair
to
the
prussian
camp
and
to
gain
admission
to
the
general
this
would
have
easily
been
granted
to
a
female
and
an
there
she
was
to
assassinate
the
enemy
of
her
country
and
to
attest
her
magnanimity
by
slaughtering
herself
i
was
weak
enough
to
regret
the
ignominious
retreat
of
the
prussians
because
it
precluded
the
necessity
of
such
a
sacrifice
this
was
related
with
accents
and
looks
that
sufficiently
attested
its
truth
constantia
shuddered
and
drew
back
to
contemplate
more
deliberately
the
features
of
her
guest
hitherto
she
had
read
in
them
nothing
that
bespoke
the
desperate
courage
of
a
martyr
and
the
deep
designing
of
an
assassin
the
image
which
her
mind
had
reflected
from
the
deportment
of
this
woman
was
changed
the
likeness
which
she
had
feigned
to
herself
was
no
longer
seen
she
felt
that
antipathy
was
preparing
to
displace
love
these
sentiments
however
she
concealed
and
suffered
the
conversation
to
proceed
their
discourse
now
turned
upon
the
exploits
of
several
women
who
mingled
in
the
tumults
of
the
capital
and
in
the
armies
on
the
frontiers
instances
were
mentioned
of
ferocity
in
some
and
magnanimity
in
others
which
almost
surpassed
belief
constantia
listened
greedily
though
not
with
approbation
and
acquired
at
every
sentence
new
desire
to
be
acquainted
with
the
personal
history
of
martinette
on
mentioning
this
wish
her
friend
said
that
she
endeavoured
to
amuse
her
exile
by
composing
her
own
memoirs
and
that
on
her
next
visit
she
would
bring
with
her
the
volume
which
she
would
suffer
constantia
to
read
a
separation
of
a
week
elapsed
she
felt
some
impatience
for
the
renewal
of
their
intercourse
and
for
the
perusal
of
the
volume
that
had
been
mentioned
one
evening
sarah
baxter
whom
constantia
had
placed
in
her
own
occasional
service
entered
the
room
with
marks
of
great
joy
and
surprise
and
informed
her
that
she
at
length
had
discovered
miss
monrose
from
her
abrupt
and
prolix
account
it
appeared
that
sarah
had
overtaken
miss
monrose
in
the
street
and
guided
by
her
own
curiosity
as
well
as
by
the
wish
to
gratify
her
mistress
she
had
followed
the
stranger
to
her
utter
astonishment
the
lady
had
paused
at
door
with
a
seeming
resolution
to
enter
it
but
presently
resumed
her
way
instead
of
pursuing
her
steps
farther
sarah
had
stopped
to
communicate
this
intelligence
to
constantia
having
delivered
her
news
she
hastened
away
but
returning
in
a
moment
with
a
countenance
of
new
surprise
she
informed
her
mistress
that
on
leaving
the
house
she
had
met
miss
monrose
at
the
door
on
the
point
of
entering
she
added
that
the
stranger
had
inquired
for
constantia
and
was
now
waiting
below
constantia
took
no
time
to
reflect
upon
an
incident
so
unexpected
and
so
strange
but
proceeded
forthwith
to
the
parlour
martinette
only
was
there
it
did
not
instantly
occur
to
her
that
this
lady
and
mademoiselle
monrose
might
possibly
be
the
same
the
inquiries
she
made
speedily
removed
her
doubts
and
it
now
appeared
that
the
woman
about
whose
destiny
she
had
formed
so
many
conjectures
and
fostered
so
much
anxiety
was
no
other
than
the
daughter
of
roselli
having
readily
answered
her
questions
martinette
inquired
in
her
turn
into
the
motives
of
her
friend
curiosity
these
were
explained
by
a
succinct
account
of
the
transactions
to
which
the
deceased
baxter
had
been
a
witness
constantia
concluded
with
mentioning
her
own
reflections
on
the
tale
and
intimating
her
wish
to
be
informed
how
martinette
had
extricated
herself
from
a
situation
so
calamitous
is
there
any
room
for
wonder
on
that
head
replied
the
guest
it
was
absurd
to
stay
longer
in
the
house
having
finished
the
interment
of
roselli
for
he
was
the
man
who
suffered
his
foolish
regrets
to
destroy
him
i
forsook
the
house
roselli
was
by
no
means
poor
but
he
could
not
consent
to
live
at
ease
or
to
live
at
all
while
his
country
endured
such
horrible
oppressions
and
when
so
many
of
his
friends
had
perished
i
complied
with
his
humour
because
it
could
not
be
changed
and
i
revered
him
too
much
to
desert
him
but
whither
said
constantia
could
you
seek
shelter
at
a
time
like
that
the
city
was
desolate
and
a
wandering
female
could
scarcely
be
received
under
any
roof
all
inhabited
houses
were
closed
at
that
hour
and
the
fear
of
infection
would
have
shut
them
against
you
if
they
had
not
been
already
so
hast
thou
forgotten
that
there
were
at
that
time
at
least
ten
thousand
french
in
this
city
fugitives
from
marat
and
from
domingo
that
they
lived
in
utter
fearlessness
of
the
reigning
disease
sung
and
loitered
in
the
public
walks
and
prattled
at
their
doors
with
all
their
customary
unconcern
supposest
thou
that
there
were
none
among
these
who
would
receive
a
countrywoman
even
if
her
name
had
not
been
martinette
de
beauvais
thy
fancy
has
depicted
strange
things
but
believe
me
that
without
a
farthing
and
without
a
name
i
should
not
have
incurred
the
slightest
inconvenience
the
death
of
roselli
i
foresaw
because
it
was
gradual
in
its
approach
and
was
sought
by
him
as
a
good
my
grief
therefore
was
exhausted
before
it
came
and
i
rejoiced
at
his
death
because
it
was
the
close
of
all
his
sorrows
the
rueful
pictures
of
my
distress
and
weakness
which
were
given
by
baxter
existed
only
in
his
own
fancy
martinette
pleaded
an
engagement
and
took
her
leave
professing
to
have
come
merely
to
leave
with
her
the
promised
manuscript
this
interview
though
short
was
productive
of
many
reflections
on
the
deceitfulness
of
appearances
and
on
the
variety
of
maxims
by
which
the
conduct
of
human
beings
is
regulated
she
was
accustomed
to
impart
all
her
thoughts
and
relate
every
new
incident
to
her
father
with
this
view
she
now
hied
to
his
apartment
this
hour
it
was
her
custom
when
disengaged
always
to
spend
with
him
she
found
dudley
busy
in
revolving
a
scheme
which
various
circumstances
had
suggested
and
gradually
conducted
to
maturity
no
period
of
his
life
had
been
equally
delightful
with
that
portion
of
his
youth
which
he
had
spent
in
italy
the
climate
the
language
the
manners
of
the
people
and
the
sources
of
intellectual
gratification
in
painting
and
music
were
congenial
to
his
taste
he
had
reluctantly
forsaken
these
enchanting
seats
at
the
summons
of
his
father
but
on
his
return
to
his
native
country
had
encountered
nothing
but
ignominy
and
pain
poverty
and
blindness
had
beset
his
path
and
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
impossible
to
fly
too
far
from
the
scene
of
his
disasters
his
misfortunes
could
not
be
concealed
from
others
and
every
thing
around
him
seemed
to
renew
the
memory
of
all
that
he
had
suffered
all
the
events
of
his
youth
served
to
entice
him
to
italy
while
all
the
incidents
of
his
subsequent
life
concurred
to
render
disgustful
his
present
abode
his
daughter
happiness
was
not
to
be
forgotten
this
he
imagined
would
be
eminently
promoted
by
the
scheme
it
would
open
to
her
new
avenues
to
knowledge
it
would
snatch
her
from
the
odious
pursuit
of
ormond
and
by
a
variety
of
objects
and
adventures
efface
from
her
mind
any
impression
which
his
dangerous
artifices
might
have
made
upon
it
this
project
was
now
communicated
to
constantia
every
argument
adapted
to
influence
her
choice
was
employed
he
justly
conceived
that
the
only
obstacle
to
her
adoption
of
it
related
to
ormond
he
expatiated
on
the
dubious
character
of
this
man
the
wildness
of
his
schemes
and
the
magnitude
of
his
errors
what
could
be
expected
from
a
man
half
of
whose
life
had
been
spent
at
the
head
of
a
band
of
cossacks
spreading
devastation
in
the
regions
of
the
danube
and
supporting
by
flagitious
intrigues
the
tyranny
of
catharine
and
the
other
half
in
traversing
inhospitable
countries
and
extinguishing
what
remained
of
clemency
and
justice
by
intercourse
with
savages
it
was
admitted
that
his
energies
were
great
but
misdirected
and
that
to
restore
them
to
the
guidance
of
truth
was
not
in
itself
impossible
but
it
was
so
with
relation
to
any
power
that
she
possessed
conformity
would
flow
from
their
marriage
but
this
conformity
was
not
to
be
expected
from
him
it
was
not
his
custom
to
abjure
any
of
his
doctrines
or
recede
from
any
of
his
claims
she
knew
likewise
the
conditions
of
their
union
she
must
go
with
him
to
some
corner
of
the
world
where
his
boasted
system
was
established
what
was
the
road
to
it
he
had
carefully
concealed
but
it
was
evident
that
it
lay
beyond
the
precincts
of
civilized
existence
whatever
were
her
ultimate
decision
it
was
at
least
proper
to
delay
it
six
years
were
yet
wanting
of
that
period
at
which
only
she
formerly
considered
marriage
as
proper
to
all
the
general
motives
for
deferring
her
choice
the
conduct
of
ormond
superadded
the
weightiest
their
correspondence
might
continue
but
her
residence
in
europe
and
converse
with
mankind
might
enlighten
her
judgement
and
qualify
her
for
a
more
rational
decision
constantia
was
not
uninfluenced
by
these
reasonings
instead
of
reluctantly
admitting
them
she
somewhat
wondered
that
they
had
not
been
suggested
by
her
own
reflections
her
imagination
anticipated
her
entrance
on
that
mighty
scene
with
emotions
little
less
than
rapturous
her
studies
had
conferred
a
thousand
ideal
charms
on
a
theatre
where
scipio
and
cæsar
had
performed
their
parts
her
wishes
were
no
less
importunate
to
gaze
upon
the
alps
and
pyrenees
and
to
vivify
and
chasten
the
images
collected
from
books
by
comparing
them
with
their
real
prototypes
no
social
ties
existed
to
hold
her
to
america
her
only
kinsman
and
friend
would
be
the
companion
of
her
journeys
this
project
was
likewise
recommended
by
advantages
of
which
she
only
was
qualified
to
judge
sophia
westwyn
had
embarked
four
years
previous
to
this
date
for
england
in
company
with
an
english
lady
and
her
husband
the
arrangements
that
were
made
forbade
either
of
the
friends
to
hope
for
a
future
meeting
yet
now
by
virtue
of
this
project
this
meeting
seemed
no
longer
to
be
hopeless
this
burst
of
new
ideas
and
now
hopes
on
the
mind
of
constantia
took
place
in
the
course
of
a
single
hour
no
change
in
her
external
situation
had
been
wrought
and
yet
her
mind
had
undergone
the
most
signal
revolution
tho
novelty
as
well
as
greatness
of
the
prospect
kept
her
in
a
state
of
elevation
and
awe
more
ravishing
than
any
she
had
ever
experienced
anticipations
of
intercourse
with
nature
in
her
most
august
forms
with
men
in
diversified
states
of
society
with
the
posterity
of
greeks
and
romans
and
with
the
actors
that
were
now
upon
the
stage
and
above
all
with
the
being
whom
absence
and
the
want
of
other
attachments
had
in
some
sort
contributed
to
deify
made
this
night
pass
away
upon
the
wings
of
transport
the
hesitation
which
existed
on
parting
with
her
father
speedily
gave
place
to
an
ardour
impatient
of
the
least
delay
she
saw
no
impediments
to
the
immediate
commencement
of
the
voyage
to
delay
it
a
month
or
even
a
week
seemed
to
be
unprofitable
tardiness
in
this
ferment
of
her
thoughts
she
was
neither
able
nor
willing
to
sleep
in
arranging
the
means
of
departure
and
anticipating
the
events
that
would
successively
arise
there
was
abundant
food
for
contemplation
she
marked
the
first
dawnings
of
the
day
and
rose
she
felt
reluctance
to
break
upon
her
father
morning
slumbers
but
considered
that
her
motives
were
extremely
urgent
and
that
the
pleasure
afforded
him
by
her
zealous
approbation
of
his
scheme
would
amply
compensate
him
for
this
unseasonable
intrusion
on
his
rest
she
hastened
therefore
to
his
chamber
she
entered
with
blithesome
steps
and
softly
drew
aside
the
curtain
chapter
iii
unhappy
constantia
at
the
moment
when
thy
dearest
hopes
had
budded
afresh
when
the
clouds
of
insecurity
and
disquiet
had
retired
from
thy
vision
wast
thou
assailed
by
the
great
subverter
of
human
schemes
thou
sawest
nothing
in
futurity
but
an
eternal
variation
and
succession
of
delights
thou
wast
hastening
to
forget
dangers
and
sorrows
which
thou
fondly
imaginedst
were
never
to
return
this
day
was
to
be
the
outset
of
a
new
career
existence
was
henceforth
to
be
embellished
with
enjoyments
hitherto
scarcely
within
the
reach
of
hope
alas
thy
predictions
of
calamity
seldom
failed
to
be
verified
not
so
thy
prognostics
of
pleasure
these
though
fortified
by
every
calculation
of
contingencies
were
edifices
grounded
upon
nothing
thy
life
was
a
struggle
with
malignant
destiny
a
contest
for
happiness
in
which
thou
wast
fated
to
be
overcome
she
stooped
to
kiss
the
venerable
cheek
of
her
father
and
by
whispering
to
break
his
slumber
her
eye
was
no
sooner
fixed
upon
his
countenance
than
she
started
back
and
shrieked
she
had
no
power
to
forbear
her
outcries
were
piercing
and
vehement
they
ceased
only
with
the
cessation
of
breath
she
sunk
upon
a
chair
in
a
state
partaking
more
of
death
than
of
life
mechanically
prompted
to
give
vent
to
her
agonies
in
shrieks
but
incapable
of
uttering
a
sound
the
alarm
called
her
servants
to
the
spot
they
beheld
her
dumb
wildly
gazing
and
gesticulating
in
a
way
that
indicated
frenzy
she
made
no
resistance
to
their
efforts
but
permitted
them
to
carry
her
back
to
her
own
chamber
sarah
called
upon
her
to
speak
and
to
explain
the
cause
of
these
appearances
but
the
shock
which
she
had
endured
seemed
to
have
irretrievably
destroyed
her
powers
of
utterance
the
terrors
of
the
affectionate
sarah
were
increased
she
kneeled
by
the
bedside
of
her
mistress
and
with
streaming
eyes
besought
the
unhappy
lady
to
compose
herself
perhaps
the
sight
of
weeping
in
another
possessed
a
sympathetic
influence
or
nature
had
made
provision
for
this
salutary
change
however
that
be
a
torrent
of
tears
now
came
to
her
succour
and
rescued
her
from
a
paroxysm
of
insanity
which
its
longer
continuance
might
have
set
beyond
the
reach
of
cure
meanwhile
a
glance
at
his
master
countenance
made
fabian
fully
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
scene
the
ghastly
visage
of
dudley
showed
that
he
was
dead
and
that
he
had
died
in
some
terrific
and
mysterious
manner
as
soon
as
this
faithful
servant
recovered
from
surprise
the
first
expedient
which
his
ingenuity
suggested
was
to
fly
with
tidings
of
this
event
to
melbourne
that
gentleman
instantly
obeyed
the
summons
with
the
power
of
weeping
constantia
recovered
the
power
of
reflection
this
for
a
time
served
her
only
as
a
medium
of
anguish
melbourne
mingled
his
tears
with
hers
and
endeavoured
by
suitable
remonstrances
to
revive
her
fortitude
the
filial
passion
is
perhaps
instinctive
to
man
but
its
energy
is
modified
by
various
circumstances
every
event
in
the
life
of
constantia
contributed
to
heighten
this
passion
beyond
customary
bounds
in
the
habit
of
perpetual
attendance
on
her
father
of
deriving
from
him
her
knowledge
and
sharing
with
him
the
hourly
fruits
of
observation
and
reflection
his
existence
seemed
blended
with
her
own
there
was
no
other
whose
concurrence
and
council
she
could
claim
with
whom
a
domestic
and
uninterrupted
alliance
could
be
maintained
the
only
bond
of
consanguinity
was
loosened
the
only
prop
of
friendship
was
taken
away
others
perhaps
would
have
observed
that
her
father
existence
had
been
merely
a
source
of
obstruction
and
perplexity
that
she
had
hitherto
acted
by
her
own
wisdom
and
would
find
hereafter
less
difficulty
in
her
choice
of
schemes
and
fewer
impediments
to
the
execution
these
reflections
occurred
not
to
her
this
disaster
had
increased
to
an
insupportable
degree
the
vacancy
and
dreariness
of
her
existence
the
face
she
was
habituated
to
behold
had
disappeared
forever
the
voice
whose
mild
and
affecting
tones
had
so
long
been
familiar
to
her
ears
was
hushed
into
eternal
silence
the
felicity
to
which
she
clung
was
ravished
away
nothing
remained
to
hinder
her
from
sinking
into
utter
despair
the
first
transports
of
grief
having
subsided
a
source
of
consolation
seemed
to
be
opened
in
the
belief
that
her
father
had
only
changed
one
form
of
being
for
another
that
he
still
lived
to
be
the
guardian
of
her
peace
and
honour
to
enter
the
recesses
of
her
thought
to
forewarn
her
of
evil
and
invite
her
to
good
she
grasped
at
these
images
with
eagerness
and
fostered
them
as
the
only
solaces
of
her
calamity
they
were
not
adapted
to
inspire
her
with
cheerfulness
but
they
sublimed
her
sensations
and
added
an
inexplicable
fascination
to
sorrow
it
was
unavoidable
sometimes
to
reflect
upon
the
nature
of
that
death
which
had
occurred
tokens
were
sufficiently
apparent
that
outward
violence
had
been
the
cause
who
could
be
the
performer
of
so
black
a
deed
by
what
motives
he
was
guided
were
topics
of
fruitless
conjecture
she
mused
upon
this
subject
not
from
the
thirst
of
vengeance
but
from
a
mournful
curiosity
had
the
perpetrator
stood
before
her
and
challenged
retribution
she
would
not
have
lifted
a
finger
to
accuse
or
to
punish
the
evil
already
endured
left
her
no
power
to
concert
and
execute
projects
for
extending
that
evil
to
others
her
mind
was
unnerved
and
recoiled
with
loathing
from
considerations
of
abstract
justice
or
political
utility
when
they
prompted
to
the
prosecution
of
the
murderer
melbourne
was
actuated
by
different
views
but
on
this
subject
he
was
painfully
bewildered
dudley
deportment
to
his
servants
and
neighbours
was
gentle
and
humane
he
had
no
dealings
with
the
trafficking
or
labouring
part
of
mankind
the
fund
which
supplied
his
cravings
of
necessity
or
habit
was
his
daughter
his
recreations
and
employments
were
harmless
and
lonely
the
evil
purpose
was
limited
to
his
death
for
his
chamber
was
exactly
in
the
same
state
in
which
negligent
security
had
left
it
no
midnight
footstep
or
voice
no
unbarred
door
or
lifted
window
afforded
tokens
of
the
presence
or
traces
of
the
entrance
or
flight
of
the
assassin
the
meditations
of
constantia
however
could
not
fail
in
some
of
their
circuities
to
encounter
the
image
of
craig
his
agency
in
the
impoverishment
of
her
father
and
in
the
scheme
by
which
she
had
like
to
have
been
loaded
with
the
penalties
of
forgery
was
of
an
impervious
and
unprecedented
kind
motives
were
unveiled
by
time
in
some
degree
accounting
for
his
treacherous
proceeding
but
there
was
room
to
suppose
an
inborn
propensity
to
mischief
was
he
not
the
author
of
this
new
evil
his
motives
and
his
means
were
equally
inscrutable
but
their
inscrutability
might
flow
from
her
own
defects
in
discernment
and
knowledge
and
time
might
supply
her
defects
in
this
as
in
former
instances
these
images
were
casual
the
causes
of
the
evil
were
seldom
contemplated
her
mind
was
rarely
at
liberty
to
wander
from
reflection
on
her
irremediable
loss
frequently
when
confused
by
distressful
recollections
she
would
detect
herself
going
to
her
father
chamber
often
his
accents
would
ring
in
her
ears
and
the
momentary
impulse
would
be
to
answer
his
calls
her
reluctance
to
sit
down
to
her
meals
without
her
usual
companion
could
scarcely
be
surmounted
in
this
state
of
mind
the
image
of
the
only
friend
who
survived
or
whose
destiny
at
least
was
doubtful
occurred
to
her
she
sunk
into
fits
of
deeper
abstraction
and
dissolved
away
in
tears
of
more
agonizing
tenderness
a
week
after
her
father
interment
she
shut
herself
up
in
her
chamber
to
torment
herself
with
fruitless
remembrances
the
name
of
sophia
westwyn
was
pronounced
and
the
ditty
that
solemnized
their
parting
was
sung
now
more
than
formerly
she
became
sensible
of
the
loss
of
that
portrait
which
had
been
deposited
in
the
hands
of
as
a
pledge
as
soon
as
her
change
of
fortune
had
supplied
her
with
the
means
of
redeeming
it
she
hastened
to
for
that
end
to
her
unspeakable
disappointment
he
was
absent
from
the
city
he
had
taken
a
long
journey
and
the
exact
period
of
his
return
could
not
be
ascertained
his
clerks
refused
to
deliver
the
picture
or
even
by
searching
to
discover
whether
it
was
still
in
their
possession
this
application
had
frequently
and
lately
been
repeated
but
without
success
had
not
yet
returned
and
his
family
were
equally
in
the
dark
as
to
the
day
on
which
his
return
might
be
expected
she
determined
on
this
occasion
to
renew
her
visit
her
incessant
disappointments
had
almost
extinguished
hope
and
she
made
inquiries
at
his
door
with
a
faltering
accent
and
sinking
heart
these
emotions
were
changed
into
surprise
and
delight
when
answer
was
made
that
he
had
just
arrived
she
was
instantly
conducted
into
his
presence
the
countenance
of
easily
denoted
that
his
visitant
was
by
no
means
acceptable
there
was
a
mixture
of
embarrassment
and
sullenness
in
his
air
which
was
far
from
being
diminished
when
the
purpose
of
this
visit
was
explained
constantia
reminded
him
of
the
offer
and
acceptance
of
this
pledge
and
of
the
conditions
with
which
the
transaction
was
accompanied
he
acknowledged
with
some
hesitation
that
a
promise
had
been
given
to
retain
the
pledge
until
it
were
in
her
power
to
redeem
it
but
the
long
delay
the
urgency
of
his
own
wants
and
particularly
the
ill
treatment
which
he
conceived
himself
to
have
suffered
in
the
transaction
respecting
the
forged
note
had
in
his
own
opinion
absolved
him
from
this
promise
he
had
therefore
sold
the
picture
to
a
goldsmith
for
as
much
as
the
gold
about
it
was
worth
this
information
produced
in
the
heart
of
constantia
a
contest
between
indignation
and
sorrow
that
for
a
time
debarred
her
from
speech
she
stifled
the
anger
that
was
at
length
rising
to
her
lips
and
calmly
inquired
to
whom
the
picture
had
been
sold
answered
that
for
his
part
he
had
little
dealings
in
gold
and
silver
but
every
thing
of
that
kind
which
fell
to
his
share
he
transacted
with
d
this
person
was
one
of
the
most
eminent
of
his
profession
his
character
and
place
of
abode
were
universally
known
tho
only
expedient
that
remained
was
to
apply
to
him
and
to
ascertain
forthwith
the
destiny
of
the
picture
it
was
too
probable
that
when
separated
from
its
case
the
portrait
was
thrown
away
or
destroyed
as
a
mere
encumbrance
but
the
truth
was
too
momentous
to
be
made
the
sport
of
mere
probability
she
left
the
house
of
and
hastened
to
that
of
the
goldsmith
the
circumstance
was
easily
recalled
to
his
remembrance
it
was
true
that
such
a
picture
had
been
offered
for
sale
and
that
he
had
purchased
it
the
workmanship
was
curious
and
he
felt
unwilling
to
destroy
it
he
therefore
hung
it
up
in
his
shop
and
indulged
the
hope
that
a
purchaser
would
some
time
be
attracted
by
the
mere
beauty
of
the
toy
constantia
hopes
were
revived
by
these
tidings
and
she
earnestly
inquired
if
it
were
still
in
his
possession
no
a
young
gentleman
had
entered
his
shop
some
months
before
the
picture
had
caught
his
fancy
and
he
had
given
a
price
which
the
artist
owned
he
should
not
have
demanded
had
he
not
been
encouraged
by
the
eagerness
which
the
gentleman
betrayed
to
possess
it
who
was
this
gentleman
had
there
been
any
previous
acquaintance
between
them
what
was
his
name
his
profession
and
where
was
he
to
be
found
really
the
goldsmith
answered
he
was
ignorant
respecting
all
those
particulars
previously
to
this
purchase
the
gentleman
had
sometimes
visited
his
shop
but
he
did
not
recollect
to
have
since
seen
him
he
was
unacquainted
with
his
name
and
his
residence
what
appeared
to
be
his
motives
for
purchasing
this
picture
the
customer
appeared
highly
pleased
with
it
pleasure
rather
than
surprise
seemed
to
be
produced
by
the
sight
of
it
if
i
were
permitted
to
judge
continued
the
artist
i
should
imagine
that
the
young
man
was
acquainted
with
the
original
to
say
the
truth
i
hinted
as
much
at
the
time
and
i
did
not
see
that
he
discouraged
the
supposition
indeed
i
can
not
conceive
how
the
picture
could
otherwise
have
gained
any
value
in
his
eyes
this
only
heightened
the
eagerness
of
constantia
to
trace
the
footsteps
of
the
youth
it
was
obvious
to
suppose
some
communication
or
connection
between
her
friend
and
this
purchaser
she
repeated
her
inquiries
and
the
goldsmith
after
some
consideration
said
why
on
second
thoughts
i
seem
to
have
some
notion
of
having
seen
a
figure
like
that
of
my
customer
go
into
a
in
front
street
some
time
before
i
met
with
him
at
my
shop
the
situation
of
this
house
being
satisfactorily
described
and
the
artist
being
able
to
afford
her
no
further
information
except
as
to
stature
and
guise
she
took
her
leave
there
were
two
motives
impelling
her
to
prosecute
her
search
after
this
person
the
desire
of
regaining
this
portrait
and
of
procuring
tidings
of
her
friend
involved
as
she
was
in
ignorance
it
was
impossible
to
conjecture
how
far
this
incident
would
be
subservient
to
these
inestimable
purposes
to
procure
an
interview
with
this
stranger
was
the
first
measure
which
prudence
suggested
she
knew
not
his
name
or
his
person
he
was
once
seen
entering
a
thither
she
must
immediately
repair
but
how
to
introduce
herself
how
to
describe
the
person
of
whom
she
was
in
search
she
knew
not
she
was
beset
with
embarrassments
and
difficulties
while
her
attention
was
entangled
by
these
she
proceeded
unconsciously
on
her
way
and
stopped
not
until
she
reached
the
mansion
that
had
been
described
here
she
paused
to
collect
her
thoughts
she
found
no
relief
in
deliberation
every
moment
added
to
her
perplexity
and
indecision
irresistibly
impelled
by
her
wishes
she
at
length
in
a
mood
that
partook
of
desperate
advanced
to
the
door
and
knocked
the
summons
was
immediately
obeyed
by
a
woman
of
decent
appearance
a
pause
ensued
which
constantia
at
length
terminated
by
a
request
to
see
the
mistress
of
the
house
the
lady
courteously
answered
that
she
was
the
person
and
immediately
ushered
her
visitant
into
an
apartment
constantia
being
seated
the
lady
waited
for
the
disclosure
of
her
message
to
prolong
the
silence
was
only
to
multiply
embarrassments
she
reverted
to
the
state
of
her
feelings
and
saw
that
they
flowed
from
inconsistency
and
folly
one
vigorous
effort
was
sufficient
to
restore
her
to
composure
and
she
began
with
apologizing
for
a
visit
unpreceded
by
an
introduction
the
object
of
her
inquiries
was
a
person
with
whom
it
was
of
the
utmost
moment
that
she
should
procure
a
meeting
but
whom
by
an
unfortunate
concurrence
of
circumstances
she
was
unable
to
describe
by
the
usual
incidents
of
name
and
profession
her
knowledge
was
confined
to
his
external
appearance
and
to
the
probability
of
his
being
an
inmate
of
this
house
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
she
then
proceeded
to
describe
his
person
and
dress
it
is
true
said
the
lady
such
a
one
as
you
describe
has
boarded
in
this
house
his
name
was
martynne
i
have
good
reason
to
remember
him
for
he
lived
with
me
three
months
and
then
left
the
country
without
paying
for
his
board
he
has
gone
then
said
constantia
greatly
discouraged
by
these
tidings
yes
he
was
a
man
of
specious
manners
and
loud
pretensions
he
came
from
england
bringing
with
him
forged
recommendatory
letters
and
after
passing
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
contracting
debts
which
he
never
paid
and
making
bargains
which
he
never
fulfilled
he
suddenly
disappeared
it
is
likely
that
he
has
returned
to
europe
had
he
no
kindred
no
friends
no
companions
he
found
none
here
he
made
pretences
to
alliances
in
england
which
better
information
has
i
believe
since
shown
to
be
false
this
was
the
sum
of
the
information
procurable
from
this
source
constantia
was
unable
to
conceal
her
chagrin
these
symptoms
were
observed
by
the
lady
whose
curiosity
was
awakened
in
turn
questions
were
obliquely
started
inviting
constantia
to
a
disclosure
of
her
thoughts
no
advantage
would
arise
from
confidence
and
the
guest
after
a
few
minutes
of
abstraction
and
silence
rose
to
take
her
leave
during
this
conference
some
one
appeared
to
be
negligently
sporting
with
the
keys
of
a
harpsichord
in
the
next
apartment
the
notes
were
too
irregular
and
faint
to
make
a
forcible
impression
on
the
ear
in
the
present
state
of
her
mind
constantia
was
merely
conscious
of
the
sound
in
the
intervals
of
conversation
having
arisen
from
her
seat
her
anxiety
to
obtain
some
information
that
might
lead
to
the
point
she
wished
made
her
again
pause
she
endeavoured
to
invent
some
new
interrogatory
better
suited
to
her
purpose
than
those
which
had
already
been
employed
a
silence
on
both
sides
ensued
during
this
interval
the
unseen
musician
suddenly
refrained
from
rambling
and
glided
into
notes
of
some
refinement
and
complexity
the
cadence
was
aerial
but
a
thunderbolt
falling
at
her
feet
would
not
have
communicated
a
more
visible
shock
to
the
senses
of
constantia
a
glance
that
denoted
a
tumult
of
soul
bordering
on
distraction
was
now
fixed
upon
the
door
that
led
into
the
room
from
whence
the
harmony
proceeded
instantly
the
cadence
was
revived
and
some
accompanying
voice
was
heard
to
warble
ah
far
beyond
this
world
of
woes
we
meet
to
part
to
part
no
more
joy
and
grief
in
their
sudden
onset
and
their
violent
extremes
approach
so
nearly
in
their
influence
on
human
beings
as
scarce
to
be
distinguished
constantia
frame
was
still
enfeebled
by
her
recent
distresses
the
torrent
of
emotion
was
too
abrupt
and
too
vehement
her
faculties
were
overwhelmed
and
she
sunk
upon
the
floor
motionless
and
without
sense
but
not
till
she
had
faintly
articulated
my
god
my
god
this
is
a
joy
unmerited
and
too
great
chapter
iv
i
must
be
forgiven
if
i
now
introduce
myself
on
the
stage
sophia
westwyn
is
the
friend
of
constantia
and
the
writer
of
this
narrative
so
far
as
my
fate
was
connected
with
that
of
my
friend
it
is
worthy
to
be
known
that
connection
has
constituted
the
joy
and
misery
of
my
existence
and
has
prompted
me
to
undertake
this
task
i
assume
no
merit
from
the
desire
of
knowledge
and
superiority
to
temptation
there
is
little
of
which
i
can
boast
but
that
little
i
derived
instrumentally
from
constantia
poor
as
my
attainments
are
it
is
to
her
that
i
am
indebted
for
them
all
life
itself
was
the
gift
of
her
father
but
my
virtue
and
felicity
are
her
gifts
that
i
am
neither
indigent
nor
profligate
flows
from
her
bounty
i
am
not
unaware
of
the
divine
superintendence
of
the
claims
upon
my
gratitude
and
service
which
pertain
to
my
god
i
know
that
all
physical
and
moral
agents
are
merely
instrumental
to
the
purpose
that
he
wills
but
though
the
great
author
of
being
and
felicity
must
not
be
forgotten
it
is
neither
possible
nor
just
to
overlook
the
claims
upon
our
love
with
which
our
are
invested
the
supreme
love
does
not
absorb
but
chastens
and
enforces
all
subordinate
affections
in
proportion
to
the
rectitude
of
my
perceptions
and
the
ardour
of
my
piety
must
i
clearly
discern
and
fervently
love
the
excellence
discovered
in
my
and
industriously
promote
their
improvement
and
felicity
from
my
infancy
to
my
seventeenth
year
i
lived
in
the
house
of
dudley
on
the
day
of
my
birth
i
was
deserted
by
my
mother
her
temper
was
more
akin
to
that
of
tigress
than
woman
yet
that
is
unjust
for
beasts
cherish
their
offspring
no
natures
but
human
are
capable
of
that
depravity
which
makes
insensible
to
the
claims
of
innocence
and
helplessness
but
let
me
not
recall
her
to
memory
have
i
not
enough
of
sorrow
yet
to
omit
my
causes
of
disquiet
the
unprecedented
forlornness
of
my
condition
and
the
persecutions
of
an
unnatural
parent
would
be
to
leave
my
character
a
problem
and
the
sources
of
my
love
of
miss
dudley
unexplored
yet
i
must
not
dwell
upon
that
complication
of
iniquities
that
savage
ferocity
and
unextinguishable
hatred
of
me
which
characterized
my
unhappy
mother
i
was
not
safe
under
the
protection
of
dudley
nor
happy
in
the
caresses
of
his
daughter
my
mother
asserted
the
privilege
of
that
relation
she
laboured
for
years
to
obtain
the
control
of
my
person
and
actions
to
snatch
me
from
a
peaceful
and
chaste
asylum
and
detain
me
in
her
own
house
where
indeed
i
should
not
have
been
in
want
of
raiment
and
food
but
where
o
my
mother
let
me
not
dishonour
thy
name
yet
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
enhance
thy
infamy
thy
crimes
unequalled
as
they
were
were
perhaps
expiated
by
thy
penitence
thy
offences
are
too
well
known
but
perhaps
they
who
witnessed
thy
freaks
of
intoxication
thy
defiance
of
public
shame
the
enormity
of
thy
pollutions
the
infatuation
that
made
thee
glory
in
the
pursuit
of
a
loathsome
and
detestable
trade
may
be
strangers
to
the
remorse
and
the
abstinence
which
accompanied
the
close
of
thy
ignominious
life
for
ten
years
was
my
peace
incessantly
molested
by
the
menaces
or
machinations
of
my
mother
the
longer
she
meditated
my
destruction
the
more
tenacious
of
her
purpose
and
indefatigable
in
her
efforts
she
became
that
my
mind
was
harassed
with
perpetual
alarms
was
not
enough
the
fame
and
tranquillity
of
dudley
and
his
daughter
were
hourly
assailed
my
mother
resigned
herself
to
the
impulses
of
malignity
and
rage
headlong
passions
and
a
vigorous
though
perverted
understanding
were
hers
hence
her
stratagems
to
undermine
the
reputation
of
my
protector
and
to
bereave
him
of
domestic
comfort
were
subtle
and
profound
had
she
not
herself
been
careless
of
that
good
which
she
endeavoured
to
wrest
from
others
her
artifices
could
scarcely
have
been
frustrated
in
proportion
to
the
hazard
which
accrued
to
my
protector
and
friend
the
more
ardent
their
zeal
in
my
defence
and
their
affection
for
my
person
became
they
watched
over
me
with
ineffable
solicitude
at
all
hours
and
in
every
occupation
i
was
the
companion
of
constantia
all
my
wants
were
supplied
in
the
same
proportion
as
hers
the
tenderness
of
dudley
seemed
equally
divided
between
us
i
partook
of
his
instructions
and
the
means
of
every
intellectual
and
personal
gratification
were
lavished
upon
me
the
speed
of
my
mother
career
in
infamy
was
at
length
slackened
she
left
new
york
which
had
long
been
the
theatre
of
her
vices
actuated
by
a
now
caprice
she
determined
to
travel
through
the
southern
states
early
indulgence
was
the
cause
of
her
ruin
but
her
parents
had
given
her
the
embellishments
of
a
fashionable
education
she
delighted
to
assume
all
parts
and
personate
the
most
opposite
characters
she
now
resolved
to
carry
a
new
name
and
the
mask
of
virtue
into
scenes
hitherto
unvisited
she
journeyed
as
far
as
charleston
here
she
met
an
inexperienced
youth
lately
arrived
from
england
and
in
possession
of
an
ample
fortune
her
speciousness
and
artifices
seduced
him
into
a
precipitate
marriage
her
true
character
however
could
not
be
long
concealed
by
herself
and
her
vices
had
been
too
conspicuous
for
her
long
to
escape
recognition
her
husband
was
infatuated
by
her
blandishments
to
abandon
her
or
to
contemplate
her
depravity
with
unconcern
were
equally
beyond
his
power
romantic
in
his
sentiments
his
fortitude
was
unequal
to
his
disappointments
and
he
speedily
sunk
into
the
grave
by
a
similar
refinement
in
generosity
he
bequeathed
to
her
his
property
with
this
accession
of
wealth
she
returned
to
her
ancient
abode
the
mask
lately
worn
seemed
preparing
to
be
thrown
aside
and
her
profligate
habits
to
be
resumed
with
more
eagerness
than
ever
but
an
unexpected
and
total
revolution
was
effected
by
the
exhortations
of
a
methodist
divine
her
heart
seemed
on
a
sudden
to
be
remoulded
her
vices
and
the
abettors
of
them
were
abjured
she
shut
out
the
intrusions
of
society
and
prepared
to
expiate
by
the
rigours
of
abstinence
and
the
bitterness
of
tears
the
offences
of
her
past
life
in
this
as
in
her
former
career
she
was
unacquainted
with
restraint
and
moderation
her
remorses
gained
strength
in
proportion
as
she
cherished
them
she
brooded
over
the
images
of
her
guilt
till
the
possibility
of
forgiveness
and
remission
disappeared
her
treatment
of
her
daughter
and
her
husband
constituted
the
chief
source
of
her
torment
her
awakened
conscience
refused
her
a
momentary
respite
from
its
persecutions
her
thoughts
became
by
rapid
degrees
tempestuous
and
gloomy
and
it
was
at
length
evident
that
her
condition
was
maniacal
in
this
state
she
was
to
me
an
object
no
longer
of
terror
but
compassion
she
was
surrounded
by
hirelings
devoid
of
personal
attachment
and
anxious
only
to
convert
her
misfortunes
to
their
own
advantage
this
evil
it
was
my
duty
to
obviate
my
presence
for
a
time
only
enhanced
the
vehemence
of
her
malady
but
at
length
it
was
only
by
my
attendance
and
soothing
that
she
was
diverted
from
the
fellest
purposes
shocking
execrations
and
outrages
resolutions
and
efforts
to
destroy
herself
and
those
around
her
were
sure
to
take
place
in
my
absence
the
moment
i
appeared
before
her
her
fury
abated
her
gesticulations
were
becalmed
and
her
voice
exerted
only
in
incoherent
and
pathetic
lamentations
these
scenes
though
so
different
from
those
which
i
had
formerly
been
condemned
to
witness
were
scarcely
less
excruciating
the
friendship
of
constantia
dudley
was
my
only
consolation
she
took
up
her
abode
with
me
and
shared
with
me
every
disgustful
and
perilous
office
which
my
mother
insanity
prescribed
of
this
consolation
however
it
was
my
fate
to
be
bereaved
my
state
was
deplorable
and
no
remedy
hitherto
employed
was
efficacious
a
voyage
to
england
was
conceived
likely
to
benefit
by
change
of
temperature
and
scenes
and
by
the
opportunity
it
would
afford
of
trying
the
superior
skill
of
english
physicians
this
scheme
after
various
struggles
on
my
part
was
adopted
it
was
detestable
to
my
imagination
because
it
severed
me
from
that
friend
in
whose
existence
mine
was
involved
and
without
whose
participation
knowledge
lost
its
attractions
and
society
became
a
torment
the
prescriptions
of
my
duty
could
not
be
disguised
or
disobeyed
and
we
parted
a
mutual
engagement
was
formed
to
record
every
sentiment
and
relate
every
event
that
happened
in
the
life
of
either
and
no
opportunity
of
communicating
information
was
to
be
omitted
this
engagement
was
punctually
performed
on
my
part
i
sought
out
every
method
of
conveyance
to
my
friend
and
took
infinite
pains
to
procure
tidings
from
her
but
all
were
ineffectual
my
mother
malady
declined
but
was
succeeded
by
a
pulmonary
disease
which
threatened
her
speedy
destruction
by
the
restoration
of
her
understanding
the
purpose
of
her
voyage
was
obtained
and
my
impatience
to
return
which
the
inexplicable
and
ominous
silence
of
my
friend
daily
increased
prompted
me
to
exert
all
my
powers
of
persuasion
to
induce
her
to
revisit
america
my
mother
frenzy
was
a
salutary
crisis
in
her
moral
history
she
looked
back
upon
her
past
conduct
with
unspeakable
loathing
but
this
retrospect
only
invigorated
her
devotion
and
her
virtue
but
the
thought
of
returning
to
the
scene
of
her
unhappiness
and
infamy
could
not
be
endured
besides
life
in
her
eyes
possessed
considerable
attractions
and
her
physicians
flattered
her
with
recovery
from
her
present
disease
if
she
would
change
the
atmosphere
of
england
for
that
of
languedoc
and
naples
i
followed
her
with
murmurs
and
reluctance
to
desert
her
in
her
present
critical
state
would
have
been
inhuman
my
mother
aversions
and
attachments
habits
and
views
were
dissonant
with
my
own
conformity
of
sentiments
and
impressions
of
maternal
tenderness
did
not
exist
to
bind
us
to
each
other
my
attendance
was
assiduous
but
it
was
the
sense
of
duty
that
rendered
my
attendance
a
supportable
task
her
decay
was
eminently
gradual
no
time
seemed
to
diminish
her
appetite
for
novelty
and
change
during
three
years
we
traversed
every
part
of
france
switzerland
and
italy
i
could
not
but
attend
to
surrounding
scenes
and
mark
the
progress
of
the
mighty
revolution
whose
effects
like
agitation
in
a
fluid
gradually
spread
from
paris
the
centre
over
the
face
of
the
neighbouring
kingdoms
but
there
passed
not
a
day
or
an
hour
in
which
the
image
of
constantia
was
not
recalled
in
which
the
most
pungent
regrets
were
not
felt
at
the
inexplicable
silence
which
had
been
observed
by
her
and
the
most
vehement
longings
indulged
to
return
to
my
native
country
my
exertions
to
ascertain
her
condition
by
indirect
means
by
interrogating
natives
of
america
with
whom
i
chanced
to
meet
were
unwearied
but
for
a
long
period
ineffectual
during
this
pilgrimage
rome
was
thrice
visited
my
indisposition
was
hastening
to
a
crisis
and
she
formed
the
resolution
of
closing
her
life
at
the
bottom
of
vesuvius
we
stopped
for
the
sake
of
a
few
days
repose
at
rome
on
the
morning
after
our
arrival
i
accompanied
some
friends
to
view
the
public
edifices
casting
my
eyes
over
the
vast
and
ruinous
interior
of
the
coliseum
my
attention
was
fixed
by
the
figure
of
a
young
man
whom
after
a
moment
pause
i
recollected
to
have
seen
in
the
streets
of
new
york
at
a
distance
from
home
mere
community
of
country
is
no
inconsiderable
bond
of
affection
the
social
spirit
prompts
us
to
cling
even
to
inanimate
objects
when
they
remind
us
of
ancient
fellowships
and
juvenile
attachments
a
servant
was
despatched
to
summon
this
stranger
who
recognised
a
countrywoman
with
a
pleasure
equal
to
that
which
i
had
received
on
nearer
view
this
person
whose
name
was
courtland
did
not
belie
my
favourable
prepossessions
our
intercourse
was
soon
established
on
a
footing
of
confidence
and
intimacy
the
destiny
of
constantia
was
always
uppermost
in
my
thoughts
this
person
acquaintance
was
originally
sought
chiefly
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
from
him
some
information
respecting
my
friend
on
inquiry
i
discovered
that
he
had
left
his
native
city
seven
months
after
me
having
tasked
his
recollection
and
compared
a
number
of
facts
the
name
of
dudley
at
length
recurred
to
him
he
had
casually
heard
the
history
of
craig
imposture
and
its
consequences
these
were
now
related
as
circumstantially
as
a
memory
occupied
by
subsequent
incidents
enabled
him
the
tale
had
been
told
to
him
in
a
domestic
circle
which
he
was
accustomed
to
frequent
by
the
person
who
purchased
dudley
lute
and
restored
it
to
its
previous
owner
on
the
conditions
formerly
mentioned
this
tale
filled
me
with
anguish
and
doubt
my
impatience
to
search
out
this
unfortunate
girl
and
share
with
her
her
sorrows
or
relieve
them
was
anew
excited
by
this
mournful
intelligence
that
constantia
dudley
was
reduced
to
beggary
was
too
abhorrent
to
my
feelings
to
receive
credit
yet
the
sale
of
her
father
property
comprising
even
his
furniture
and
clothing
seemed
to
prove
that
she
had
fallen
even
to
this
depth
this
enabled
me
in
some
degree
to
account
for
her
silence
her
generous
spirit
would
induce
her
to
conceal
misfortunes
from
her
friend
which
no
communication
would
alleviate
it
was
possible
that
she
had
selected
some
new
abode
and
that
in
consequence
the
letters
i
had
written
and
which
amounted
to
volumes
had
never
reached
her
hands
my
mother
state
would
not
suffer
me
to
obey
the
impulse
of
my
heart
her
frame
was
verging
towards
dissolution
courtland
engagements
allowed
him
to
accompany
us
to
naples
and
here
the
long
series
of
my
mother
pilgrimages
closed
in
death
her
obsequies
were
no
sooner
performed
than
i
determined
to
set
out
on
my
voyage
my
mother
property
which
in
consequence
of
her
decease
devolved
upon
me
was
not
inconsiderable
there
is
scarcely
any
good
so
dear
to
a
rational
being
as
competence
i
was
not
unacquainted
with
its
benefits
but
this
acquisition
was
valuable
to
mo
chiefly
as
it
enabled
me
to
reunite
my
fate
to
that
of
constantia
courtland
was
my
countryman
and
friend
he
was
destitute
of
fortune
and
had
been
led
to
europe
partly
by
the
spirit
of
adventure
and
partly
on
a
mercantile
project
he
had
made
sale
of
his
property
on
advantageous
terms
in
the
ports
of
france
and
resolved
to
consume
the
produce
in
examining
this
scene
of
heroic
exploits
and
memorable
revolutions
his
slender
stock
though
frugally
and
even
parsimoniously
administered
was
nearly
exhausted
and
at
the
time
of
our
meeting
at
rome
he
was
making
reluctant
preparations
to
return
sufficient
opportunity
was
afforded
us
in
an
unrestrained
and
domestic
intercourse
of
three
months
which
succeeded
our
roman
interview
to
gain
a
knowledge
of
each
other
there
was
that
conformity
of
tastes
and
views
between
us
which
could
scarcely
fail
at
an
age
and
in
a
situation
like
ours
to
give
birth
to
tenderness
my
resolution
to
hasten
to
america
was
peculiarly
unwelcome
to
my
friend
he
had
offered
to
be
my
companion
but
this
offer
my
regard
to
his
interest
obliged
me
to
decline
but
i
was
willing
to
compensate
him
for
this
denial
as
well
as
to
gratify
my
own
heart
by
an
immediate
marriage
so
long
a
residence
in
england
and
italy
had
given
birth
to
friendships
and
connections
of
the
dearest
kind
i
had
no
view
but
to
spend
my
life
with
courtland
in
the
midst
of
my
maternal
kindred
who
were
english
a
voyage
to
america
and
reunion
with
constantia
were
previously
indispensable
but
i
hoped
that
my
friend
might
be
prevailed
upon
and
that
her
disconnected
situation
would
permit
her
to
return
with
me
to
europe
if
this
end
could
not
be
accomplished
it
was
my
inflexible
purpose
to
live
and
die
with
her
suitably
to
this
arrangement
courtland
was
to
repair
to
london
and
wait
patiently
till
i
should
be
able
to
rejoin
him
there
or
to
summon
him
to
meet
me
in
america
a
week
after
my
mother
death
i
became
a
wife
and
embarked
the
next
day
at
naples
in
a
ragusan
ship
destined
for
new
york
the
voyage
was
tempestuous
and
tedious
the
vessel
was
necessitated
to
make
a
short
stay
at
toulon
the
state
of
that
city
however
then
in
possession
of
the
english
and
besieged
by
the
revolutionary
forces
was
adverse
to
commercial
views
happily
we
resumed
our
voyage
on
the
day
previous
to
that
on
which
the
place
was
evacuated
by
the
british
our
seasonable
departure
rescued
us
from
witnessing
a
scene
of
horrors
of
which
the
history
of
former
wars
furnishes
us
with
few
examples
a
cold
and
boisterous
navigation
awaited
us
my
palpitations
and
inquietudes
augmented
as
we
approached
the
american
coast
i
shall
not
forget
the
sensations
which
i
experienced
on
the
sight
of
the
beacon
at
sandy
hook
it
was
first
seen
at
midnight
in
a
stormy
and
beclouded
atmosphere
emerging
from
the
waves
whose
fluctuation
allowed
it
for
some
time
to
be
visible
only
by
fits
this
token
of
approaching
land
affected
me
as
much
as
if
i
had
reached
the
threshold
of
my
dwelling
at
length
we
entered
the
port
and
i
viewed
with
but
inexplicable
feelings
objects
with
which
i
had
been
from
infancy
familiar
the
flagstaff
erected
on
the
battery
recalled
to
my
imagination
the
pleasures
of
the
evening
and
morning
walks
which
i
had
taken
on
that
spot
with
the
lost
constantia
the
dream
was
fondly
cherished
that
the
figure
which
i
saw
loitering
along
the
terrace
was
hers
on
disembarking
i
gazed
at
every
female
passenger
in
hope
that
it
was
she
whom
i
sought
an
absence
of
three
years
had
obliterated
from
my
memory
none
of
the
images
which
attended
me
on
my
departure
chapter
after
a
night
of
repose
rather
than
of
sleep
i
began
the
search
after
my
friend
i
went
to
the
house
which
the
dudleys
formerly
inhabited
and
which
had
been
the
asylum
of
my
infancy
it
was
now
occupied
by
strangers
by
whom
no
account
could
be
given
of
its
former
tenants
i
obtained
directions
to
the
owner
of
the
house
he
was
equally
unable
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
the
purchase
had
been
made
at
a
public
sale
and
terms
had
been
settled
not
with
dudley
but
with
the
sheriff
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
history
of
craig
imposture
and
its
consequences
were
confirmed
by
every
one
who
resided
at
that
period
in
new
york
the
dudleys
were
well
remembered
and
their
disappearance
immediately
after
their
fall
had
been
generally
noticed
but
whither
they
had
retired
was
a
problem
which
no
one
was
able
to
solve
this
evasion
was
strange
by
what
motives
the
dudleys
were
induced
to
change
their
ancient
abode
could
be
vaguely
guessed
my
grandfather
was
a
native
of
the
west
indies
descendants
of
the
same
stock
still
resided
in
tobago
they
might
be
affluent
and
to
them
it
was
possible
that
dudley
in
this
change
of
fortune
had
betaken
himself
for
relief
this
was
a
mournful
expedient
since
it
would
raise
a
barrier
between
my
friend
and
myself
scarcely
to
be
surmounted
constantia
mother
was
stolen
by
dudley
from
a
convent
at
amiens
there
were
no
affinities
therefore
to
draw
them
to
france
her
grandmother
was
a
native
of
baltimore
of
a
family
of
some
note
by
name
ridgeley
this
family
might
still
exist
and
have
either
afforded
an
asylum
to
the
dudleys
or
at
least
be
apprized
of
their
destiny
it
was
obvious
to
conclude
that
they
no
longer
existed
within
the
precincts
of
new
york
a
journey
to
baltimore
was
the
next
expedient
this
journey
was
made
in
the
depth
of
winter
and
by
the
speediest
conveyance
i
made
no
more
than
a
day
sojourn
in
philadelphia
the
epidemic
by
which
that
city
had
been
lately
ravaged
i
had
not
heard
of
till
my
arrival
in
america
its
devastations
were
then
painted
to
my
fancy
in
the
most
formidable
colours
a
few
months
only
had
elapsed
since
its
extinction
and
i
expected
to
see
numerous
marks
of
misery
and
depopulation
to
my
no
small
surprise
however
no
vestiges
of
this
calamity
were
to
be
discerned
all
houses
were
open
all
streets
thronged
and
all
faces
thoughtless
or
busy
the
arts
and
the
amusements
of
life
seemed
as
sedulously
cultivated
as
ever
little
did
i
then
think
what
had
been
and
what
at
that
moment
was
the
condition
of
my
friend
i
stopped
for
the
sake
of
respite
from
fatigue
and
did
not
therefore
pass
much
time
in
the
streets
perhaps
had
i
walked
seasonably
abroad
we
might
have
encountered
each
other
and
thus
have
saved
ourselves
from
a
thousand
anxieties
at
baltimore
i
made
myself
known
without
the
formality
of
introduction
to
the
ridgeleys
they
acknowledged
their
relationship
to
dudley
but
professed
absolute
ignorance
of
his
fate
indirect
intercourse
only
had
been
maintained
formerly
by
dudley
with
his
mother
kindred
they
had
heard
of
his
misfortune
a
twelvemonth
after
it
happened
but
what
measures
had
been
subsequently
pursued
their
kinsman
had
not
thought
proper
to
inform
them
the
failure
of
this
expedient
almost
bereft
me
of
hope
neither
my
own
imagination
nor
the
ridgeleys
could
suggest
any
new
mode
by
which
my
purpose
was
likely
to
be
accomplished
to
leave
america
without
obtaining
the
end
of
my
visit
could
not
be
thought
of
without
agony
and
yet
the
continuance
of
my
stay
promised
me
no
relief
from
my
uncertainties
on
this
theme
i
ruminated
without
ceasing
i
recalled
every
conversation
and
incident
of
former
times
and
sought
in
them
a
clue
by
which
my
present
conjectures
might
be
guided
one
night
immersed
alone
in
my
chamber
my
thoughts
were
thus
employed
my
train
of
meditation
was
on
this
occasion
new
from
the
review
of
particulars
from
which
no
satisfaction
had
hitherto
been
gained
i
passed
to
a
vague
and
comprehensive
retrospect
dudley
early
life
his
profession
of
a
painter
his
zeal
in
this
pursuit
and
his
reluctance
to
quit
it
were
remembered
would
he
not
revert
to
this
profession
when
other
means
of
subsistence
were
gone
it
is
true
similar
obstacles
with
those
which
had
formerly
occasioned
his
resort
to
a
different
path
existed
at
present
and
no
painter
of
his
name
was
to
be
found
in
philadelphia
baltimore
or
new
york
but
would
it
not
occur
to
him
that
the
patronage
denied
to
his
skill
by
the
frugal
and
unpolished
habits
of
his
countrymen
might
with
more
probability
of
success
be
sought
from
the
opulence
and
luxury
of
london
nay
had
he
not
once
affirmed
in
my
hearing
that
if
he
ever
were
reduced
to
poverty
this
was
the
method
he
would
pursue
this
conjecture
was
too
bewitching
to
be
easily
dismissed
every
new
reflection
augmented
its
force
i
was
suddenly
raised
by
it
from
the
deepest
melancholy
to
the
region
of
lofty
and
gay
hopes
happiness
of
which
i
had
begun
to
imagine
myself
irretrievably
bereft
seemed
once
more
to
approach
within
my
reach
constantia
would
not
only
be
found
but
be
met
in
the
midst
of
those
comforts
which
her
father
skill
could
not
fail
to
procure
and
on
that
very
stage
where
i
most
desired
to
encounter
her
dudley
had
many
friends
and
associates
of
his
youth
in
london
filial
duty
had
repelled
their
importunities
to
fix
his
abode
in
europe
when
summoned
home
by
his
father
on
his
father
death
these
solicitations
had
been
renewed
but
were
disregarded
for
reasons
which
he
afterwards
himself
confessed
were
fallacious
that
they
would
a
third
time
be
preferred
and
would
regulate
his
conduct
seemed
to
me
incontestable
i
regarded
with
wonder
and
deep
regret
the
infatuation
that
had
hitherto
excluded
these
images
from
my
understanding
and
my
memory
how
many
dangers
and
toils
had
i
endured
since
my
embarkation
at
naples
to
the
present
moment
how
many
lingering
minutes
had
i
told
since
my
first
interview
with
courtland
all
were
owing
to
my
own
stupidity
had
my
present
thoughts
been
seasonably
suggested
i
might
long
since
have
been
restored
to
the
embraces
of
my
friend
without
the
necessity
of
an
hour
separation
from
my
husband
these
were
evils
to
be
repaired
as
far
as
it
was
possible
nothing
now
remained
but
to
procure
a
passage
to
europe
for
this
end
diligent
inquiries
were
immediately
set
on
foot
a
vessel
was
found
which
in
a
few
weeks
would
set
out
upon
the
voyage
having
bespoken
a
conveyance
it
was
incumbent
on
me
to
sustain
with
patience
the
unwelcome
delay
meanwhile
my
mind
delivered
from
the
dejection
and
perplexities
that
lately
haunted
it
was
capable
of
some
attention
to
surrounding
objects
i
marked
the
peculiarities
of
manners
and
language
in
my
new
abode
and
studied
the
effects
which
a
political
and
religious
system
so
opposite
to
that
with
which
i
had
conversed
in
italy
and
switzerland
had
produced
i
found
that
the
difference
between
europe
and
america
lay
chiefly
in
this
that
in
the
former
all
things
tended
to
extremes
whereas
in
the
latter
all
things
tended
to
the
same
level
genius
and
virtue
and
happiness
on
these
shores
were
distinguished
by
a
sort
of
mediocrity
conditions
were
less
unequal
and
men
were
strangers
to
the
heights
of
enjoyment
and
the
depths
of
misery
to
which
the
inhabitants
of
europe
are
accustomed
i
received
friendly
notice
and
hospitable
treatment
from
the
ridgeleys
these
people
were
mercantile
and
plodding
in
their
habits
i
found
in
their
social
circle
little
exercise
for
the
sympathies
of
my
heart
and
willingly
accepted
their
aid
to
enlarge
the
sphere
of
my
observation
about
a
week
before
my
intended
embarkation
and
when
suitable
preparation
had
been
made
for
that
event
a
lady
arrived
in
town
who
was
cousin
to
my
constantia
she
had
frequently
been
mentioned
in
favourable
terms
in
my
hearing
she
had
passed
her
life
in
a
rural
abode
with
her
father
who
cultivated
his
own
domain
lying
forty
miles
from
baltimore
on
an
offer
being
made
to
introduce
us
to
each
other
i
consented
to
know
one
whose
chief
recommendation
in
my
eyes
consisted
in
her
affinity
to
constantia
dudley
i
found
an
artless
and
attractive
female
unpolished
and
undepraved
by
much
intercourse
with
mankind
at
first
sight
i
was
powerfully
struck
by
the
resemblance
of
her
features
to
those
of
my
friend
which
sufficiently
denoted
their
connection
with
a
common
stock
the
first
interview
afforded
mutual
satisfaction
on
our
second
meeting
discourse
insensibly
led
to
the
mention
of
miss
dudley
and
of
the
design
which
had
brought
me
to
america
she
was
deeply
affected
by
the
earnestness
with
which
i
expatiated
on
her
cousin
merits
and
by
the
proofs
which
my
conduct
had
given
of
unlimited
attachment
i
dwelt
immediately
on
the
measures
which
i
had
hitherto
ineffectually
pursued
to
trace
her
footsteps
and
detailed
the
grounds
of
my
present
belief
that
we
should
meet
in
london
during
this
recital
my
companion
sighed
and
wept
when
i
finished
my
tale
her
tears
instead
of
ceasing
flowed
with
new
vehemence
this
appearance
excited
some
surprise
and
i
ventured
to
ask
the
cause
of
her
grief
alas
she
replied
i
am
personally
a
stranger
to
my
cousin
but
her
character
has
been
amply
displayed
to
me
by
one
who
knew
her
well
i
weep
to
think
how
much
she
has
suffered
how
much
excellence
we
have
lost
nay
said
i
all
her
sufferings
will
i
hope
be
compensated
and
i
by
no
means
consider
her
as
lost
if
my
search
in
london
be
unsuccessful
then
shall
i
indeed
despair
despair
then
already
said
my
sobbing
companion
for
your
search
will
be
unsuccessful
how
i
feel
for
your
disappointment
but
it
can
not
be
known
too
soon
my
cousin
is
dead
these
tidings
were
communicated
with
tokens
of
sincerity
and
sorrow
that
left
me
no
room
to
doubt
that
they
were
believed
by
the
relater
my
own
emotions
were
suspended
till
interrogations
had
obtained
a
knowledge
of
her
reasons
for
crediting
this
fatal
event
and
till
she
had
explained
the
time
and
manner
of
her
death
a
friend
of
miss
ridgeley
father
had
witnessed
the
devastations
of
the
yellow
fever
in
philadelphia
he
was
apprized
of
the
relationship
that
subsisted
between
his
friend
and
the
dudleys
he
gave
a
minute
and
circumstantial
account
of
the
arts
of
craig
he
mentioned
the
removal
of
my
friends
to
philadelphia
their
obscure
and
indigent
life
and
finally
their
falling
victims
to
the
pestilence
he
related
the
means
by
which
he
became
apprized
of
their
fate
and
drew
a
picture
of
their
death
surpassing
all
that
imagination
can
conceive
of
shocking
and
deplorable
the
quarter
where
they
lived
was
nearly
desolate
their
house
was
shut
up
and
for
a
time
imagined
to
be
uninhabited
some
suspicions
being
awakened
in
those
who
superintended
the
burial
of
the
dead
the
house
was
entered
and
the
father
and
child
discovered
to
be
dead
the
former
was
stretched
upon
his
wretched
pallet
while
the
daughter
was
found
on
the
floor
of
the
lower
room
in
a
state
that
denoted
the
sufferance
not
only
of
disease
but
of
famine
this
tale
was
false
subsequent
discoveries
proved
this
to
be
a
detestable
artifice
of
craig
who
stimulated
by
incurable
habits
had
invented
these
disasters
for
the
purpose
of
enhancing
the
opinion
of
his
humanity
and
of
furthering
his
views
on
the
fortune
and
daughter
of
ridgeley
its
falsehood
however
i
had
as
yet
no
means
of
ascertaining
i
received
it
as
true
and
at
once
dismissed
all
my
claims
upon
futurity
all
hope
of
happiness
in
this
mutable
and
sublunary
scene
was
fled
nothing
remained
but
to
join
my
friend
in
a
world
where
woes
are
at
an
end
and
virtue
finds
recompense
surely
said
i
there
will
some
time
be
a
close
to
calamity
and
discord
to
those
whose
lives
have
been
blameless
but
harassed
by
inquietudes
to
which
not
their
own
but
the
errors
of
others
have
given
birth
a
fortress
will
hereafter
be
assigned
unassailable
by
change
impregnable
to
sorrow
o
my
constantia
i
will
live
to
cherish
thy
remembrance
and
to
emulate
thy
virtue
i
will
endure
the
privation
of
thy
friendship
and
the
vicissitudes
that
shall
befall
me
and
draw
my
consolation
and
courage
from
the
foresight
of
no
distant
close
to
this
terrestrial
scene
and
of
ultimate
and
everlasting
union
with
thee
this
consideration
though
it
kept
me
from
confusion
and
despair
could
not
but
with
the
healing
aid
of
time
render
me
tranquil
or
strenuous
my
strength
was
unequal
to
the
struggle
of
my
passions
the
ship
in
which
i
engaged
to
embark
could
not
wait
for
my
restoration
to
health
and
i
was
left
behind
mary
ridgeley
was
artless
and
affectionate
she
saw
that
her
society
was
dearer
to
me
than
that
of
any
other
and
was
therefore
seldom
willing
to
leave
my
chamber
her
presence
less
on
her
own
account
than
by
reason
of
her
personal
resemblance
and
her
affinity
by
birth
to
constantia
was
a
powerful
solace
i
had
nothing
to
detain
me
longer
in
america
i
was
anxious
to
change
my
present
lonely
state
for
the
communion
of
those
friends
in
england
and
the
performance
of
those
duties
which
were
left
to
me
i
was
informed
that
a
british
packet
would
shortly
sail
from
new
york
my
frame
was
sunk
into
greater
weakness
than
i
had
felt
at
any
former
period
and
i
conceived
that
to
return
to
new
york
by
water
was
more
commodious
than
to
perform
the
journey
by
land
this
arrangement
was
likewise
destined
to
be
disappointed
one
morning
i
visited
according
to
my
custom
mary
ridgeley
i
found
her
in
a
temper
somewhat
inclined
to
gayety
she
rallied
me
with
great
archness
on
the
care
with
which
i
had
concealed
from
her
a
tender
engagement
into
which
i
had
lately
entered
i
supposed
myself
to
comprehend
her
allusion
and
therefore
answered
that
accident
rather
than
design
had
made
me
silent
on
the
subject
of
marriage
she
had
hitherto
known
me
by
no
appellation
but
sophia
courtland
i
had
thought
it
needless
to
inform
her
that
i
was
indebted
for
my
name
to
my
husband
courtland
being
his
name
all
that
said
my
friend
i
know
already
and
so
you
sagely
think
that
my
knowledge
goes
no
further
than
that
we
are
not
bound
to
love
our
husbands
longer
than
their
lives
there
is
no
crime
i
believe
in
referring
the
living
to
the
dead
and
most
heartily
do
congratulate
you
on
your
present
choice
what
mean
you
i
confess
your
discourse
surpasses
my
comprehension
at
that
moment
the
bell
at
the
door
rung
a
loud
peal
miss
ridgeley
hastened
down
at
this
signal
saying
with
much
significance
i
am
a
poor
hand
at
solving
a
riddle
here
comes
one
who
if
i
mistake
not
will
find
no
difficulty
in
clearing
up
your
doubts
presently
she
came
up
and
said
with
a
smile
of
still
greater
archness
here
is
a
young
gentleman
a
friend
of
mine
to
whom
i
must
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
you
he
has
come
for
the
special
purpose
of
solving
my
riddle
i
attended
her
to
the
parlour
without
hesitation
she
presented
me
with
great
formality
to
a
youth
whose
appearance
did
not
greatly
prepossess
me
in
favour
of
his
judgement
he
approached
me
with
an
air
supercilious
and
ceremonious
but
the
moment
he
caught
a
glance
at
my
face
he
shrunk
back
visibly
confounded
and
embarrassed
a
pause
ensued
in
which
miss
ridgeley
had
opportunity
to
detect
the
error
into
which
she
had
been
led
by
the
vanity
of
this
young
man
how
now
mr
martynne
said
my
friend
in
a
tone
of
ridicule
is
it
possible
you
do
not
know
the
lady
who
is
the
queen
of
your
affections
the
tender
and
indulgent
fair
one
whose
portrait
you
carry
in
your
bosom
and
whose
image
you
daily
and
nightly
bedew
with
your
tears
and
kisses
martynne
confusion
instead
of
being
subdued
by
his
struggle
only
grew
more
conspicuous
and
after
a
few
incoherent
speeches
and
apologies
during
which
he
carefully
avoided
encountering
my
eyes
he
hastily
departed
i
applied
to
my
friend
with
great
earnestness
for
an
explanation
of
this
scene
it
seems
that
in
the
course
of
conversation
with
him
on
the
preceding
day
he
had
suffered
a
portrait
which
hung
at
his
breast
to
catch
miss
ridgeley
eye
on
her
betraying
a
desire
to
inspect
it
more
nearly
he
readily
produced
it
my
image
had
been
too
well
copied
by
the
artist
not
to
be
instantly
recognised
she
concealed
her
knowledge
of
the
original
and
by
questions
well
adapted
to
the
purpose
easily
drew
from
him
confessions
that
this
was
the
portrait
of
his
mistress
he
let
fall
sundry
innuendoes
and
surmises
tending
to
impress
her
with
a
notion
of
the
rank
fortune
and
intellectual
accomplishments
of
the
nymph
and
particularly
of
the
doting
fondness
and
measureless
confidence
with
which
she
regarded
him
her
imperfect
knowledge
of
my
situation
left
her
in
some
doubt
as
to
the
truth
of
these
pretensions
and
she
was
willing
to
ascertain
the
truth
by
bringing
about
an
interview
to
guard
against
evasions
and
artifice
in
the
lover
she
carefully
concealed
from
him
her
knowledge
of
the
original
and
merely
pretended
that
a
friend
of
hers
was
far
more
beautiful
than
her
whom
this
picture
represented
she
added
that
she
expected
a
visit
from
her
friend
the
next
morning
and
was
willing
by
showing
her
to
martynne
to
convince
him
how
much
he
was
mistaken
in
supposing
the
perfections
of
his
mistress
unrivalled
chapter
vi
martynne
while
ho
expressed
his
confidence
that
the
experiment
would
only
confirm
his
triumph
readily
assented
to
the
proposal
and
the
interview
above
described
took
place
accordingly
the
next
morning
had
he
not
been
taken
by
surprise
it
is
likely
the
address
of
a
man
who
possessed
no
contemptible
powers
would
have
extricated
him
from
some
of
his
embarrassment
that
my
portrait
should
be
in
the
possession
of
one
whom
i
had
never
before
seen
and
whose
character
and
manners
entitled
him
to
no
respect
was
a
source
of
some
surprise
this
mode
of
multiplying
faces
is
extremely
prevalent
in
this
age
and
was
eminently
characteristic
of
those
with
whom
i
had
associated
in
different
parts
of
europe
the
nature
of
my
thoughts
had
modified
my
features
into
an
expression
which
my
friends
were
pleased
to
consider
as
a
model
for
those
who
desired
to
personify
the
genius
of
suffering
and
resignation
hence
among
those
whose
religion
permitted
their
devotion
to
a
picture
of
a
female
the
symbols
of
their
chosen
deity
were
added
to
features
and
shape
that
resembled
mine
my
own
caprice
as
well
as
that
of
others
always
dictated
a
symbolical
and
in
every
new
instance
a
different
accompaniment
of
this
kind
hence
was
offered
the
means
of
tracing
the
history
of
that
picture
which
martynne
possessed
it
had
been
accurately
examined
by
miss
ridgeley
and
her
description
of
the
frame
in
which
it
was
placed
instantly
informed
me
that
it
was
the
same
which
at
our
parting
i
left
in
the
possession
of
constantia
my
friend
and
myself
were
desirous
of
employing
the
skill
of
a
saxon
painter
by
name
eckstein
each
of
us
were
drawn
by
him
she
with
the
cincture
of
venus
and
i
with
the
crescent
of
dian
this
symbol
was
still
conspicuous
on
the
brow
of
that
image
which
miss
ridgeley
had
examined
and
served
to
identify
the
original
proprietor
this
circumstance
tended
to
confirm
my
fears
that
constantia
was
dead
since
that
she
would
part
with
this
picture
during
her
life
was
not
to
be
believed
it
was
of
little
moment
to
discover
how
it
came
into
the
hands
of
the
present
possessor
those
who
carried
her
remains
to
the
grave
had
probably
torn
it
from
her
neck
and
afterwards
disposed
of
it
for
money
by
whatever
means
honest
or
illicit
it
had
been
acquired
by
martynne
it
was
proper
that
it
should
be
restored
to
me
it
was
valuable
to
me
because
it
had
been
the
property
of
one
whom
i
loved
and
it
might
prove
highly
injurious
to
my
fame
and
my
happiness
as
the
tool
of
this
vanity
and
the
attestor
of
his
falsehood
i
therefore
wrote
him
a
letter
acquainting
him
with
my
reasons
for
desiring
the
repossession
of
this
picture
and
offering
a
price
for
it
at
least
double
its
value
as
a
mere
article
of
traffic
martynne
accepted
the
terms
he
transmitted
the
picture
and
with
it
a
note
apologizing
for
the
artifice
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
and
mentioning
in
order
to
justify
his
acceptance
of
the
price
which
i
had
offered
that
he
had
lately
purchased
it
for
an
equal
sum
of
a
goldsmith
in
philadelphia
this
information
suggested
a
new
reflection
constantia
had
engaged
to
preserve
for
the
use
of
her
friend
copious
and
accurate
memorials
of
her
life
copies
of
these
were
on
suitable
occasions
to
be
transmitted
to
me
during
my
residence
abroad
these
i
had
never
received
but
it
was
highly
probable
that
her
punctuality
in
the
performance
of
the
first
part
of
her
engagement
had
been
equal
to
my
own
what
i
asked
had
become
of
these
precious
memorials
in
the
wreck
of
her
property
were
these
irretrievably
engulfed
it
was
not
probable
that
they
had
been
wantonly
destroyed
they
had
fallen
perhaps
into
hands
careless
or
unconscious
of
their
value
or
still
lay
unknown
and
neglected
at
the
bottom
of
some
closet
or
chest
their
recovery
might
be
effected
by
vehement
exertions
or
by
some
miraculous
accident
suitable
inquiries
carried
on
among
those
who
were
active
in
those
scenes
of
calamity
might
afford
some
clue
by
which
the
fate
of
the
dudleys
and
the
disposition
of
their
property
might
come
into
fuller
light
these
inquiries
could
be
made
only
in
philadelphia
and
thither
for
that
purpose
i
now
resolved
to
repair
there
was
still
an
interval
of
some
weeks
before
the
departure
of
the
packet
in
which
i
proposed
to
embark
having
returned
to
the
capital
i
devoted
all
my
zeal
to
my
darling
project
my
efforts
however
were
without
success
those
who
administered
charity
and
succour
during
that
memorable
season
and
who
survived
could
remove
none
of
my
doubts
nor
answer
any
of
my
inquiries
innumerable
tales
equally
disastrous
with
those
which
miss
ridgeley
had
heard
were
related
but
for
a
considerable
period
none
of
their
circumstances
were
sufficiently
accordant
with
the
history
of
the
dudleys
it
is
worthy
of
remark
in
how
many
ways
and
by
what
complexity
of
motives
human
curiosity
is
awakened
and
knowledge
obtained
by
its
connection
with
my
darling
purpose
every
event
in
the
history
of
this
memorable
pest
was
earnestly
sought
and
deeply
pondered
the
powerful
considerations
which
governed
me
made
me
slight
those
punctilious
impediments
which
in
other
circumstances
would
have
debarred
me
from
intercourse
with
the
immediate
actors
and
observers
i
found
none
who
were
unwilling
to
expatiate
on
this
topic
or
to
communicate
the
knowledge
they
possessed
their
details
were
copious
in
particulars
and
vivid
in
minuteness
they
exhibited
the
state
of
manners
the
diversified
effects
of
evil
or
heroic
passions
and
the
endless
forms
which
sickness
and
poverty
assume
in
the
obscure
recesses
of
a
commercial
and
populous
city
some
of
these
details
are
too
precious
to
be
lost
it
is
above
all
things
necessary
that
we
should
be
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
condition
of
our
justice
and
compassion
are
the
fruit
of
knowledge
the
misery
that
overspreads
so
large
a
part
of
mankind
exists
chiefly
because
those
who
are
able
to
relieve
it
do
not
know
that
it
exists
forcibly
to
paint
the
evil
seldom
fails
to
excite
the
virtue
of
the
spectator
and
seduce
him
into
wishes
at
least
if
not
into
exertions
of
beneficence
the
circumstances
in
which
i
was
placed
were
perhaps
wholly
singular
hence
the
knowledge
i
obtained
was
more
comprehensive
and
authentic
than
was
possessed
by
any
one
even
of
the
immediate
actors
or
sufferers
this
knowledge
will
not
be
useless
to
myself
or
to
the
world
the
motives
which
dictated
the
present
narrative
will
hinder
me
from
relinquishing
the
pen
till
my
fund
of
observation
and
experience
be
exhausted
meanwhile
let
me
resume
the
thread
of
my
tale
the
period
allowed
me
before
my
departure
was
nearly
expired
and
my
purpose
seemed
to
be
as
far
from
its
accomplishment
as
ever
one
evening
i
visited
a
lady
who
was
the
widow
of
a
physician
whose
disinterested
exertions
had
cost
him
his
life
she
dwelt
with
pathetic
earnestness
on
the
particulars
of
her
own
distress
and
listened
with
deep
attention
to
the
inquiries
and
doubts
which
i
had
laid
before
her
after
a
pause
of
consideration
she
said
that
an
incident
like
that
related
by
me
she
had
previously
heard
from
one
of
her
friends
whose
name
she
mentioned
this
person
was
one
of
those
whose
office
consisted
in
searching
out
the
sufferers
and
affording
them
unsought
and
unsolicited
relief
she
was
offering
to
introduce
me
to
this
person
when
he
entered
the
apartment
after
the
usual
compliments
my
friend
led
the
conversation
as
i
wished
between
thompson
tale
and
that
related
to
miss
ridgeley
there
was
an
obvious
resemblance
the
sufferers
resided
in
an
obscure
alley
they
had
shut
themselves
up
from
all
intercourse
with
their
neighbours
and
had
died
neglected
and
unknown
thompson
was
vested
with
the
superintendence
of
this
district
and
had
passed
the
house
frequently
without
suspicion
of
its
being
tenanted
he
was
at
length
informed
by
one
of
those
who
conducted
a
hearse
that
he
had
seen
the
window
in
the
upper
story
of
this
house
lifted
and
a
female
show
herself
it
was
night
and
the
hearseman
chanced
to
be
passing
the
door
he
immediately
supposed
that
the
person
stood
in
need
of
his
services
and
stopped
this
procedure
was
comprehended
by
the
person
at
the
window
who
leaning
out
addressed
him
in
a
broken
and
feeble
voice
she
asked
him
why
he
had
not
taken
a
different
route
and
upbraided
him
for
inhumanity
in
leading
his
noisy
vehicle
past
her
door
she
wanted
repose
but
the
ceaseless
rumbling
of
his
wheels
would
not
allow
her
the
sweet
respite
of
a
moment
this
invective
was
singular
and
uttered
in
a
voice
which
united
the
utmost
degree
of
earnestness
with
a
feebleness
that
rendered
it
almost
inarticulate
the
man
was
at
a
loss
for
a
suitable
answer
his
pause
only
increased
the
impatience
of
the
person
at
the
window
who
called
upon
him
in
a
still
more
anxious
tone
to
proceed
and
entreated
him
to
avoid
this
alley
for
the
future
he
answered
that
he
must
come
whenever
the
occasion
called
him
that
three
persons
now
lay
dead
in
this
alley
and
that
he
must
be
expeditious
in
their
removal
but
that
he
would
return
as
seldom
and
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
he
was
interrupted
by
new
exclamations
and
upbraidings
these
terminated
in
a
burst
of
tears
and
assertions
that
god
and
man
were
her
enemies
that
they
were
determined
to
destroy
her
but
she
trusted
that
the
time
would
come
when
their
own
experience
would
avenge
her
wrongs
and
teach
them
some
compassion
for
the
misery
of
others
saying
this
she
shut
the
window
with
violence
and
retired
from
it
sobbing
with
a
vehemence
that
could
be
distinctly
overheard
by
him
in
the
street
he
paused
for
some
time
listening
when
this
passion
should
cease
the
habitation
was
slight
and
he
imagined
that
he
heard
her
traversing
the
floor
while
he
stayed
she
continued
to
vent
her
anguish
in
exclamations
and
sighs
and
passionate
weeping
it
did
not
appear
that
any
other
person
was
within
thompson
being
next
day
informed
of
these
incidents
endeavoured
to
enter
the
house
but
his
signals
though
loud
and
frequently
repeated
being
unnoticed
he
was
obliged
to
gain
admission
by
violence
an
old
man
and
a
female
lovely
in
the
midst
of
emaciation
and
decay
were
discovered
without
signs
of
life
the
death
of
the
latter
appeared
to
have
been
very
recent
in
examining
the
house
no
traces
of
other
inhabitants
were
to
be
found
nothing
serviceable
as
food
was
discovered
but
the
remnants
of
mouldy
bread
scattered
on
a
table
no
information
could
be
gathered
from
neighbours
respecting
the
condition
and
name
of
these
unfortunate
people
they
had
taken
possession
of
this
house
during
the
rage
of
this
malady
and
refrained
from
all
communication
with
their
neighbours
there
was
too
much
resemblance
between
this
and
the
story
formerly
heard
not
to
produce
the
belief
that
they
related
to
the
same
persons
all
that
remained
was
to
obtain
directions
to
the
proprietor
of
this
dwelling
and
exact
from
him
all
that
he
knew
respecting
his
tenants
i
found
in
him
a
man
of
worth
and
affability
he
readily
related
that
a
man
applied
to
him
for
the
use
of
this
house
and
that
the
application
was
received
at
the
beginning
of
the
pestilence
a
numerous
family
inhabited
this
tenement
but
had
died
in
rapid
succession
this
new
applicant
was
the
first
to
apprize
him
of
this
circumstance
and
appeared
extremely
anxious
to
enter
on
immediate
possession
it
was
intimated
to
him
that
danger
would
arise
from
the
pestilential
condition
of
the
house
unless
cleansed
and
purified
disease
would
be
unavoidably
contracted
the
inconvenience
and
hazard
this
applicant
was
willing
to
encounter
and
at
length
hinted
that
no
alternative
was
allowed
him
by
his
present
landlord
but
to
lie
in
the
street
or
to
procure
some
other
abode
what
was
the
external
appearance
of
this
person
he
was
infirm
past
the
middle
age
of
melancholy
aspect
and
indigent
garb
a
year
had
since
elapsed
and
more
characteristic
particulars
had
not
been
remarked
or
were
forgotten
the
name
had
been
mentioned
but
in
the
midst
of
more
recent
and
momentous
transactions
had
vanished
from
remembrance
dudley
or
dolby
or
hadley
seemed
to
approach
more
nearly
than
any
other
sounds
permission
to
inspect
the
house
was
readily
granted
it
had
remained
since
that
period
unoccupied
the
furniture
and
goods
were
scanty
and
wretched
and
he
did
not
care
to
endanger
his
safety
by
meddling
with
them
he
believed
that
they
had
not
been
removed
or
touched
i
was
insensible
of
any
hazard
which
attended
my
visit
and
with
the
guidance
of
a
servant
who
felt
as
little
apprehension
as
myself
hastened
to
the
spot
i
found
nothing
but
tables
and
chairs
clothing
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
an
earthen
pot
without
handle
and
broken
stood
upon
the
no
other
implement
or
vessel
for
the
preparation
of
food
appeared
these
forlorn
appearances
were
accounted
for
by
the
servant
by
supposing
the
house
to
have
been
long
since
rifled
of
every
thing
worth
the
trouble
of
removal
by
the
villains
who
occupied
the
neighbouring
houses
this
alley
it
seems
being
noted
for
the
profligacy
of
its
inhabitants
when
i
reflected
that
a
wretched
hovel
like
this
had
been
probably
the
last
retreat
of
the
dudleys
when
i
painted
their
sufferings
of
which
the
numberless
tales
of
distress
of
which
i
had
lately
been
an
auditor
enabled
me
to
form
an
adequate
conception
i
felt
as
if
to
lie
down
and
expire
on
the
very
spot
where
constantia
had
fallen
was
the
only
sacrifice
to
friendship
which
time
had
left
to
me
from
this
house
i
wandered
to
the
field
where
the
dead
had
been
promiscuously
and
by
hundreds
interred
i
counted
the
long
series
of
graves
which
were
closely
ranged
and
being
recently
levelled
exhibited
the
appearance
of
a
harrowed
field
methought
i
could
have
given
thousands
to
know
in
what
spot
the
body
of
my
friend
lay
that
i
might
moisten
the
sacred
earth
with
my
tears
boards
hastily
nailed
together
formed
the
best
receptacle
which
the
exigencies
of
the
time
could
grant
to
the
dead
many
corpses
were
thrown
into
a
single
excavation
and
all
distinctions
founded
on
merit
and
rank
were
obliterated
the
father
and
child
had
been
placed
in
the
same
cart
and
thrown
into
the
same
hole
despairing
by
any
longer
stay
in
the
city
to
effect
my
purpose
and
the
period
of
my
embarkation
being
near
i
prepared
to
resume
my
journey
i
should
have
set
out
the
next
day
but
a
family
with
whom
i
had
made
acquaintance
expecting
to
proceed
to
new
york
within
a
week
i
consented
to
be
their
companion
and
for
that
end
to
delay
my
departure
meanwhile
i
shut
myself
up
in
my
apartment
and
pursued
avocations
that
were
adapted
to
the
melancholy
tenor
of
my
thoughts
the
day
preceding
that
appointed
for
my
journey
arrived
it
was
necessary
to
complete
my
arrangements
with
the
family
with
whom
i
was
to
travel
and
to
settle
with
the
lady
whose
apartments
i
occupied
on
how
slender
threads
does
our
destiny
hang
had
not
a
momentary
impulse
tempted
me
to
sing
my
favourite
ditty
to
the
harpsichord
to
beguile
the
short
interval
during
which
my
hostess
was
conversing
with
her
visitor
in
the
next
apartment
i
should
have
speeded
to
new
york
have
embarked
for
europe
and
been
eternally
severed
from
my
friend
whom
i
believed
to
have
died
in
frenzy
and
beggary
but
who
was
alive
and
affluent
and
who
sought
me
with
a
diligence
scarcely
inferior
to
my
own
we
imagined
ourselves
severed
from
each
other
by
death
or
by
impassable
seas
but
at
the
moment
when
our
hopes
had
sunk
to
the
lowest
ebb
a
mysterious
destiny
conducted
our
footsteps
to
the
same
spot
i
heard
a
murmuring
exclamation
i
heard
my
hostess
call
in
a
voice
of
terror
for
help
i
rushed
into
the
room
i
saw
one
stretched
on
the
floor
in
the
attitude
of
death
i
sprung
forward
and
fixed
my
eyes
upon
her
countenance
i
clasped
my
hands
and
articulated
constantia
she
speedily
recovered
from
her
swoon
her
eyes
opened
she
moved
she
spoke
still
methought
it
was
an
illusion
of
the
senses
that
created
the
phantom
i
could
not
bear
to
withdraw
my
eyes
from
her
countenance
if
they
wandered
for
a
moment
i
fell
into
doubt
and
perplexity
and
again
fixed
them
upon
her
to
assure
myself
of
her
existence
the
succeeding
three
days
were
spent
in
a
state
of
dizziness
and
intoxication
the
ordinary
functions
of
nature
were
disturbed
the
appetite
for
sleep
and
for
food
were
confounded
and
lost
amidst
the
impetuosities
of
a
to
look
and
to
talk
to
each
other
afforded
enchanting
occupation
for
every
moment
i
would
not
part
from
her
side
but
eat
and
slept
walked
and
mused
and
read
with
my
arm
locked
in
hers
and
with
her
breath
fanning
my
cheek
i
have
indeed
much
to
learn
sophia
courtland
has
never
been
wise
her
affections
disdain
the
cold
dictates
of
discretion
and
spurn
at
every
limit
that
contending
duties
and
mixed
obligations
prescribe
and
yet
o
precious
inebriation
of
the
heart
o
love
what
pleasure
of
reason
or
of
sense
can
stand
in
competition
with
those
attendant
upon
thee
whether
thou
hiest
to
the
fanes
of
a
benevolent
deity
or
layest
all
thy
homage
at
the
feet
of
one
who
most
visibly
resembles
the
perfections
of
our
maker
surely
thy
sanction
is
divine
thy
boon
is
happiness
chapter
vii
the
tumults
of
curiosity
and
pleasure
did
not
speedily
subside
the
story
of
each
other
wanderings
was
told
with
endless
amplification
and
minuteness
henceforth
the
stream
of
our
existence
was
to
mix
we
were
to
act
and
to
think
in
common
casual
witnesses
and
written
testimony
should
become
superfluous
eyes
and
ears
were
to
be
eternally
employed
upon
the
conduct
of
each
other
death
when
it
should
come
was
not
to
be
deplored
because
it
was
an
unavoidable
and
brief
privation
to
her
that
should
survive
being
under
any
modification
is
dear
but
that
state
to
which
death
is
a
passage
is
to
virtue
and
to
grief
meanwhile
precedent
events
were
made
the
themes
of
endless
conversation
every
incident
and
passion
in
the
course
of
four
years
was
revived
and
exhibited
the
name
of
ormond
was
of
course
frequently
repeated
by
my
friend
his
features
and
deportment
were
described
her
meditations
and
resolutions
with
regard
to
him
fully
disclosed
my
counsel
was
asked
in
what
manner
it
became
her
to
act
i
could
not
but
harbour
aversion
to
a
scheme
which
should
tend
to
sever
me
from
constantia
or
to
give
me
a
competitor
in
her
affections
besides
this
the
properties
of
ormond
were
of
too
mysterious
a
nature
to
make
him
worthy
of
acceptance
little
more
was
known
concerning
him
than
what
he
himself
had
disclosed
to
the
dudleys
but
this
knowledge
would
suffice
to
invalidate
his
claims
he
had
dwelt
in
his
conversations
with
constantia
sparingly
on
his
own
concerns
yet
he
did
not
hide
from
her
that
he
had
been
left
in
early
youth
to
his
own
guidance
that
he
had
embraced
when
almost
a
child
the
trade
of
arms
that
he
had
found
service
and
promotion
in
the
armies
of
potemkin
and
romanzow
that
he
had
executed
secret
and
diplomatic
functions
at
constantinople
and
berlin
that
in
the
latter
city
he
had
met
with
schemers
and
reasoners
who
aimed
at
the
of
the
world
and
the
subversion
of
all
that
has
hitherto
been
conceived
elementary
and
fundamental
in
the
constitution
of
man
and
of
government
that
some
of
those
reformers
had
secretly
united
to
break
down
the
military
and
monarchical
fabric
of
german
policy
that
others
more
wisely
had
devoted
their
secret
efforts
not
to
overturn
but
to
build
that
for
this
end
they
embraced
an
exploring
and
colonizing
project
that
he
had
allied
himself
to
these
and
for
the
promotion
of
their
projects
had
spent
six
years
of
his
life
in
journeys
by
sea
and
land
in
tracts
unfrequented
till
then
by
any
european
what
were
the
moral
or
political
maxims
which
this
adventurous
and
visionary
sect
had
adopted
and
what
was
the
seat
of
their
empire
whether
on
the
shore
of
an
continent
or
in
the
heart
of
desert
america
he
carefully
concealed
these
were
exhibited
or
hidden
or
shifted
according
to
his
purpose
not
to
reveal
too
much
and
not
to
tire
curiosity
or
overtask
belief
was
his
daily
labour
he
talked
of
alliance
with
the
family
whose
name
he
bore
and
who
had
lost
their
honours
and
estates
by
the
hanoverian
succession
to
the
crown
of
england
i
had
seen
too
much
of
innovation
and
imposture
in
france
and
italy
not
to
regard
a
man
like
this
with
aversion
and
fear
the
mind
of
my
friend
was
wavering
and
unsuspicious
she
had
lived
at
a
distance
from
scenes
where
principles
are
hourly
put
to
the
test
of
experiment
where
all
extremes
of
fortitude
and
pusillanimity
are
accustomed
to
meet
where
recluse
virtue
and
speculative
heroism
gives
place
as
if
by
magic
to
the
last
excesses
of
debauchery
and
wickedness
where
pillage
and
murder
are
engrafted
on
systems
of
and
benevolence
and
the
good
of
mankind
is
professed
to
be
pursued
with
bonds
of
association
and
covenants
of
secrecy
hence
my
friend
had
decided
without
the
sanction
of
experience
had
allowed
herself
to
wander
into
untried
paths
and
had
hearkened
to
positions
pregnant
with
destruction
and
ignominy
it
was
not
difficult
to
exhibit
in
their
true
light
the
enormous
errors
of
this
man
and
the
danger
of
prolonging
their
intercourse
her
assent
to
accompany
me
to
england
was
readily
obtained
too
much
despatch
could
not
be
used
but
the
disposal
of
her
property
must
first
take
place
this
was
necessarily
productive
of
some
delay
i
had
been
made
contrary
to
inclination
expert
in
the
management
of
all
affairs
relative
to
property
my
mother
lunacy
subsequent
disease
and
death
had
imposed
upon
me
obligations
and
cares
little
suitable
to
my
sex
and
age
they
could
not
be
eluded
or
transferred
to
others
and
by
degrees
experience
enlarged
my
knowledge
and
familiarized
my
tasks
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
visit
and
inspect
my
friend
estate
in
jersey
while
she
remained
in
her
present
abode
to
put
an
end
to
the
views
and
expectations
of
ormond
and
to
make
preparation
for
her
voyage
we
were
reconciled
to
a
temporary
separation
by
the
necessity
that
prescribed
it
during
our
residence
together
the
mind
of
constantia
was
kept
in
perpetual
ferment
the
second
day
after
my
departure
the
turbulence
of
her
feelings
began
to
subside
and
she
found
herself
at
leisure
to
pursue
those
measures
which
her
present
situation
prescribed
the
time
prefixed
by
ormond
for
the
termination
of
his
absence
had
nearly
arrived
her
resolutions
respecting
this
man
lately
formed
now
occurred
to
her
her
heart
drooped
as
she
revolved
the
necessity
of
disuniting
their
fates
but
that
this
disunion
was
proper
could
not
admit
of
doubt
how
information
of
her
present
views
might
be
most
satisfactorily
imparted
to
him
was
a
question
not
instantly
decided
she
reflected
on
the
impetuosity
of
his
character
and
conceived
that
her
intentions
might
be
most
conveniently
unfolded
in
a
letter
this
letter
she
immediately
sat
down
to
write
just
then
the
door
opened
and
ormond
entered
the
apartment
she
was
somewhat
and
for
a
moment
startled
by
this
abrupt
and
entrance
yet
she
greeted
him
with
pleasure
her
greeting
was
received
with
coldness
a
second
glance
at
his
countenance
informed
her
that
his
mind
was
somewhat
discomposed
folding
his
hands
on
his
breast
ho
stalked
to
the
window
and
looked
up
at
the
moon
presently
he
withdrew
his
gaze
from
this
object
and
fixed
it
upon
constantia
he
spoke
but
his
words
were
produced
by
a
kind
of
effort
fit
emblem
he
exclaimed
of
human
versatility
one
impediment
is
gone
i
hoped
it
was
the
only
one
but
no
the
removal
of
that
merely
made
room
for
another
let
this
be
removed
well
fate
will
interplace
a
third
all
our
toils
will
thus
be
frustrated
and
the
ruin
will
finally
redound
upon
our
heads
there
he
stopped
this
strain
could
not
be
interpreted
by
constantia
she
smiled
and
without
noticing
his
incoherences
proceeded
to
inquire
into
his
adventures
during
their
separation
he
listened
to
her
but
his
eyes
fixed
upon
hers
and
his
solemnity
of
aspect
were
immovable
when
she
paused
he
seated
himself
close
to
her
and
grasping
her
hand
with
a
vehemence
that
almost
pained
her
said
look
at
me
steadfastly
can
you
read
my
thoughts
can
your
discernment
reach
the
bounds
of
my
knowledge
and
the
bottom
of
my
purposes
catch
you
not
a
view
of
the
monsters
that
are
starting
into
birth
and
he
put
his
left
hand
to
his
forehead
but
you
can
not
should
i
paint
them
to
you
verbally
you
would
call
me
jester
or
deceiver
what
pity
that
you
have
not
instruments
for
piercing
into
thoughts
i
presume
said
constantia
affecting
cheerfulness
which
she
did
not
feel
such
instruments
would
be
useless
to
me
you
never
scruple
to
say
what
you
think
your
designs
are
no
sooner
conceived
than
they
are
expressed
all
you
know
all
you
wish
and
all
you
purpose
are
known
to
others
as
soon
as
to
yourself
no
scruples
of
decorum
no
foresight
of
consequences
are
obstacles
in
your
way
true
replied
he
all
obstacles
are
trampled
under
foot
but
one
what
is
the
insuperable
one
incredulity
in
him
that
hears
i
must
not
say
what
will
not
be
credited
i
must
not
relate
feats
and
avow
schemes
when
my
hearer
will
say
feats
were
never
performed
these
schemes
are
not
yours
i
care
not
if
the
truth
of
my
tenets
and
the
practicability
of
my
purposes
be
denied
still
i
will
openly
maintain
them
but
when
my
assertions
will
themselves
be
disbelieved
when
it
is
denied
that
i
adopt
the
creed
and
project
the
plans
which
i
affirm
to
be
adopted
and
projected
by
me
it
is
needless
to
affirm
i
mean
to
ascertain
the
height
of
the
lunar
mountains
by
travelling
to
the
top
of
them
then
i
will
station
myself
in
the
track
of
the
last
comet
and
wait
till
its
circumvolution
suffers
me
to
leap
upon
it
then
by
walking
on
its
surface
i
will
ascertain
whether
it
be
hot
enough
to
burn
my
soles
do
you
believe
that
this
can
be
done
no
do
you
believe
in
consequence
of
my
assertion
that
i
design
to
do
this
and
that
in
my
apprehension
it
is
easy
to
be
done
not
unless
i
previously
believe
you
to
be
lunatic
then
why
should
i
assert
my
purposes
why
speak
when
the
hearer
will
infer
nothing
from
my
speech
but
that
i
am
either
lunatic
or
liar
in
that
predicament
silence
is
best
in
that
predicament
i
now
stand
i
am
not
going
to
unfold
myself
just
now
i
pitied
thee
for
want
of
eyes
was
a
foolish
compassion
thou
art
happy
because
thou
seest
not
an
inch
before
thee
or
behind
here
he
was
for
a
moment
buried
in
thought
then
breaking
from
his
reverie
he
said
so
your
father
is
dead
true
said
constantia
endeavouring
to
suppress
her
rising
emotions
he
is
no
more
it
is
so
recent
an
event
that
i
imagined
you
a
stranger
to
it
false
imagination
thinkest
thou
i
would
refrain
from
knowing
what
so
nearly
concerns
us
both
perhaps
your
opinion
of
my
ignorance
extends
beyond
this
perhaps
i
know
not
your
fruitless
search
for
a
picture
perhaps
i
neither
followed
you
nor
led
you
to
a
being
called
sophia
courtland
i
was
not
present
at
the
meeting
i
am
unapprized
of
the
effects
of
your
romantic
passion
for
each
other
i
did
not
witness
the
rapturous
effusions
and
inexorable
counsels
of
the
newcomer
i
know
not
the
contents
of
the
letter
which
you
are
preparing
to
write
as
he
spoke
this
the
accents
of
ormond
gradually
augmented
in
vehemence
his
countenance
bespoke
a
deepening
inquietude
and
growing
passion
he
stopped
at
the
mention
of
the
letter
because
his
voice
was
overpowered
by
emotion
this
pause
afforded
room
for
the
astonishment
of
constantia
her
interviews
and
conversations
with
me
took
place
at
seasons
of
general
repose
when
all
doors
were
fast
and
avenues
shut
in
the
midst
of
silence
and
in
the
bosom
of
retirement
the
theme
of
our
discourse
was
commonly
too
sacred
for
any
ears
but
our
own
disclosures
were
of
too
intimate
and
delicate
a
nature
for
any
but
a
female
audience
they
were
too
injurious
to
the
fame
and
peace
of
ormond
for
him
to
be
admitted
to
partake
of
them
yet
his
words
implied
a
full
acquaintance
with
recent
events
and
with
purposes
and
deliberations
shrouded
as
we
imagined
in
impenetrable
secrecy
as
soon
as
constantia
recovered
from
the
confusion
of
these
thoughts
she
eagerly
questioned
him
what
do
you
know
how
do
you
know
what
has
happened
or
what
is
intended
poor
constantia
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
bitter
and
sarcastic
how
hopeless
is
thy
ignorance
to
enlighten
thee
is
past
my
power
what
do
i
know
every
thing
not
a
tittle
has
escaped
me
thy
letter
is
superfluous
i
know
its
contents
before
they
are
written
i
was
to
be
told
that
a
soldier
and
a
traveller
a
man
who
refused
his
faith
to
dreams
and
his
homage
to
shadows
merited
only
scorn
and
forgetfulness
that
thy
affections
and
person
were
due
to
another
that
intercourse
between
us
was
henceforth
to
cease
that
preparation
was
making
for
a
voyage
to
britain
and
that
ormond
was
to
walk
to
his
grave
alone
in
spite
of
harsh
tones
and
inflexible
features
these
words
were
accompanied
with
somewhat
that
betrayed
a
mind
full
of
discord
and
agony
constantia
astonishment
was
mingled
with
dejection
the
discovery
of
a
passion
deeper
and
less
curable
than
she
suspected
the
perception
of
embarrassments
and
difficulties
in
the
path
which
she
had
chosen
that
had
not
previously
occurred
to
her
threw
her
mind
into
anxious
suspense
the
measures
she
had
previously
concerted
were
still
approved
to
part
from
ormond
was
enjoined
by
every
dictate
of
discretion
and
duty
an
explanation
of
her
motives
and
views
could
not
take
place
more
seasonably
than
at
present
every
consideration
of
justice
to
herself
and
humanity
to
ormond
made
it
desirable
that
this
interview
should
be
the
last
by
inexplicable
means
he
had
gained
a
knowledge
of
her
intentions
it
was
expedient
therefore
to
state
them
with
clearness
and
force
in
what
words
this
was
to
be
done
was
the
subject
of
momentary
deliberation
her
thoughts
were
discerned
and
her
speech
anticipated
by
her
companion
why
droopest
thou
and
why
thus
silent
constantia
the
secret
of
thy
fate
will
never
be
detected
till
thy
destiny
be
finished
it
will
not
be
the
topic
of
a
single
fear
but
not
for
thyself
but
me
art
thou
concerned
thou
dreadest
yet
determinest
to
confirm
my
predictions
of
thy
voyage
to
europe
and
thy
severance
from
me
dismiss
thy
inquietudes
on
that
score
what
misery
thy
scorn
and
thy
rejection
are
able
to
inflict
is
inflicted
already
thy
decision
was
known
to
me
as
soon
as
it
was
formed
thy
motives
were
known
not
an
argument
or
plea
of
thy
counsellor
not
a
syllable
of
her
invective
not
a
sound
of
her
persuasive
rhetoric
escaped
my
hearing
i
know
thy
decree
to
be
immutable
as
my
doubts
so
my
wishes
have
taken
their
flight
perhaps
in
the
depth
of
thy
ignorance
it
was
supposed
that
i
should
struggle
to
reverse
thy
purpose
by
menaces
or
supplications
that
i
should
boast
of
the
cruelty
with
which
i
should
avenge
an
imaginary
wrong
upon
myself
no
all
is
very
well
go
not
a
whisper
of
objection
or
reluctance
shalt
thou
hear
from
me
if
i
could
think
said
constantia
with
tremulous
hesitation
that
you
part
from
me
without
anger
that
you
see
the
rectitude
of
my
proceeding
anger
rectitude
i
peace
i
know
thou
art
i
know
that
all
objection
to
thy
purpose
would
be
vain
thinkest
thou
that
thy
stay
undictated
by
love
the
mere
fruit
of
compassion
would
afford
me
pleasure
or
crown
my
wishes
no
i
am
not
so
dastardly
a
wretch
there
was
something
in
thy
power
to
bestow
but
thy
will
accords
not
with
thy
power
i
merit
not
the
boon
and
thou
refusest
it
i
am
content
here
ormond
fixed
more
significant
eyes
upon
her
poor
constantia
he
continued
shall
i
warn
thee
of
the
danger
that
awaits
thee
for
what
end
to
elude
it
is
impossible
it
will
come
and
thou
perhaps
wilt
be
unhappy
foresight
that
enables
not
to
shun
only
precreates
the
evil
come
it
will
though
future
it
knows
not
the
empire
of
contingency
an
inexorable
and
immutable
decree
enjoins
it
perhaps
it
is
thy
nature
to
meet
with
calmness
what
can
not
be
shunned
perhaps
when
it
is
past
thy
reason
will
perceive
its
irrevocable
nature
and
restore
thee
to
peace
such
is
the
conduct
of
the
wise
but
such
i
fear
the
education
of
constantia
dudley
will
debar
her
from
pursuing
fain
would
i
regard
it
as
the
test
of
thy
wisdom
i
look
upon
thy
past
life
all
the
forms
of
genuine
adversity
have
beset
thy
youth
poverty
disease
servile
labour
a
criminal
and
hapless
parent
have
been
evils
which
thou
hast
not
ungracefully
sustained
an
absent
friend
and
murdered
father
were
added
to
thy
list
of
woes
and
here
thy
courage
was
deficient
thy
soul
was
proof
against
substantial
misery
but
sunk
into
helpless
cowardice
at
the
sight
of
phantoms
one
more
disaster
remains
to
call
it
by
its
true
name
would
be
useless
or
pernicious
useless
because
thou
wouldst
pronounce
its
occurrence
impossible
pernicious
because
if
its
possibility
were
granted
the
omen
would
distract
thee
with
fear
how
shall
i
describe
it
is
it
loss
of
fame
no
the
deed
will
be
unwitnessed
by
a
human
creature
thy
reputation
will
be
spotless
for
nothing
will
be
done
by
thee
unsuitable
to
the
tenor
of
thy
past
life
calumny
will
not
be
heard
to
whisper
all
that
know
thee
will
be
lavish
of
their
eulogies
as
ever
their
eulogies
will
be
as
justly
merited
of
this
merit
thou
wilt
entertain
as
just
and
as
adequate
conceptions
as
now
it
is
no
repetition
of
the
evils
thou
hast
already
endured
it
is
neither
drudgery
nor
sickness
nor
privation
of
friends
strange
perverseness
of
human
reason
it
is
an
evil
it
will
be
thought
upon
with
agony
it
will
close
up
all
the
sources
of
pleasurable
recollection
it
will
exterminate
hope
it
will
endear
oblivion
and
push
thee
into
an
untimely
grave
yet
to
grasp
it
is
impossible
the
moment
we
inspect
it
nearly
it
vanishes
thy
claims
to
human
approbation
and
divine
applause
will
be
undiminished
and
unaltered
by
it
the
testimony
of
approving
conscience
will
have
lost
none
of
its
explicitness
and
energy
yet
thou
wilt
feed
upon
sighs
thy
tears
will
flow
without
remission
thou
wilt
grow
enamoured
of
death
and
perhaps
wilt
anticipate
the
stroke
of
disease
yet
perhaps
my
prediction
is
groundless
as
my
knowledge
perhaps
thy
discernment
will
avail
to
make
thee
wise
and
happy
perhaps
thou
wilt
perceive
thy
privilege
of
sympathetic
and
intellectual
activity
to
be
untouched
heaven
grant
the
of
my
prophecy
thy
disenthralment
from
error
and
the
perpetuation
of
thy
happiness
saying
this
ormond
withdrew
his
words
were
always
accompanied
with
gestures
and
looks
and
tones
that
fastened
the
attention
of
the
hearer
but
the
terms
of
his
present
discourse
afforded
independently
of
gesticulation
and
utterance
sufficient
motives
to
attention
and
remembrance
he
was
gone
but
his
image
was
contemplated
by
constantia
his
words
still
rung
in
her
ears
the
letter
she
designed
to
compose
was
rendered
by
this
interview
unnecessary
meanings
of
which
she
and
her
friend
alone
were
conscious
were
discovered
by
ormond
through
some
other
medium
than
words
yet
that
was
impossible
a
being
unendowed
with
preternatural
attributes
could
gain
the
information
which
this
man
possessed
only
by
the
exertion
of
his

chapter
viii
these
incidents
and
reflections
were
speedily
transmitted
to
me
i
had
always
believed
the
character
and
machinations
of
ormond
to
be
worthy
of
caution
and
fear
his
means
of
information
i
did
not
pretend
and
thought
it
useless
to
investigate
we
can
not
hide
our
actions
and
thoughts
from
one
of
powerful
sagacity
whom
the
detection
sufficiently
interests
to
make
him
use
all
the
methods
of
detection
in
his
power
the
study
of
concealment
is
in
all
cases
fruitless
or
hurtful
all
that
duty
enjoins
is
to
design
and
to
execute
nothing
which
may
not
be
approved
by
a
divine
and
omniscient
observer
human
scrutiny
is
neither
to
be
solicited
nor
shunned
human
approbation
or
censure
can
never
be
exempt
from
injustice
because
our
limited
perceptions
debar
us
from
a
thorough
knowledge
of
any
actions
and
motives
but
our
own
on
reviewing
what
had
passed
between
constantia
and
me
i
recollected
nothing
incompatible
with
purity
and
rectitude
that
ormond
was
apprized
of
all
that
had
passed
i
by
no
means
inferred
from
the
tenor
of
his
conversation
with
constantia
nor
if
this
had
been
incontestably
proved
should
i
have
experienced
any
trepidation
or
anxiety
on
that
account
his
obscure
and
indirect
menaces
of
evil
were
of
more
importance
his
discourse
on
this
topic
seemed
susceptible
only
of
two
constructions
either
he
intended
some
fatal
mischief
and
was
willing
to
torment
her
by
fears
while
he
concealed
from
her
the
nature
of
her
danger
that
he
might
hinder
her
from
guarding
her
safety
by
suitable
precautions
or
being
hopeless
of
rendering
her
propitious
to
his
wishes
his
malice
was
satisfied
with
leaving
her
a
legacy
of
apprehension
and
doubt
constantia
unacquaintance
with
the
doctrines
of
that
school
in
which
ormond
was
probably
instructed
led
her
to
regard
the
conduct
of
this
man
with
more
curiosity
and
wonder
than
fear
she
saw
nothing
but
a
disposition
to
sport
with
her
ignorance
and
bewilder
her
with
doubts
i
do
not
believe
myself
destitute
of
courage
rightly
to
estimate
the
danger
and
encounter
it
with
firmness
are
worthy
of
a
rational
being
but
to
place
our
security
in
thoughtlessness
and
blindness
is
only
less
ignoble
than
cowardice
i
could
not
forget
the
proofs
of
violence
which
accompanied
the
death
of
dudley
i
could
not
overlook
in
the
recent
conversation
with
constantia
ormond
allusion
to
her
murdered
father
it
was
possible
that
the
nature
of
this
death
had
been
accidentally
imparted
to
him
but
it
was
likewise
possible
that
his
was
the
knowledge
of
one
who
performed
the
act
the
enormity
of
this
deed
appeared
by
no
means
incongruous
with
the
sentiments
of
ormond
human
life
is
momentous
or
trivial
in
our
eyes
according
to
the
course
which
our
habits
and
opinions
have
taken
passion
greedily
accepts
and
habit
readily
offers
the
sacrifice
of
another
life
and
reason
obeys
the
impulse
of
education
and
desire
a
youth
of
eighteen
a
volunteer
in
a
russian
army
encamped
in
bessarabia
made
prey
of
a
tartar
girl
found
in
the
field
of
a
recent
battle
conducting
her
to
his
quarters
he
met
a
friend
who
on
some
pretence
claimed
the
victim
from
angry
words
they
betook
themselves
to
swords
a
combat
ensued
in
which
the
first
claimant
ran
his
antagonist
through
the
body
he
then
bore
his
prize
unmolested
away
and
having
exercised
brutality
of
one
kind
upon
the
helpless
victim
stabbed
her
to
the
heart
as
an
offering
to
the
of
sarsefield
the
friend
whom
he
had
slain
next
morning
willing
more
signally
to
expiate
his
guilt
he
rushed
alone
upon
a
troop
of
turkish
foragers
and
brought
away
five
heads
suspended
by
their
gory
locks
to
his
horse
mane
these
he
cast
upon
the
grave
of
sarsefield
and
conceived
himself
fully
to
have
expiated
yesterday
offence
in
reward
for
his
prowess
the
general
gave
him
a
commission
in
the
cossack
troops
this
youth
was
ormond
and
such
is
a
specimen
of
his
exploits
during
a
military
career
of
eight
years
in
a
warfare
the
most
savage
and
implacable
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
iniquitous
and
wanton
which
history
records
with
passions
and
habits
like
these
the
life
of
another
was
a
trifling
sacrifice
to
vengeance
or
impatience
how
dudley
had
excited
the
resentment
of
ormond
by
what
means
the
assassin
had
accomplished
his
intention
without
awakening
alarm
or
incurring
suspicion
it
was
not
for
me
to
discover
the
inextricability
of
human
events
the
imperviousness
of
cunning
and
the
obduracy
of
malice
i
had
frequent
occasions
to
remark
i
did
not
labour
to
vanquish
the
security
of
my
friend
as
to
precautions
they
were
useless
there
was
no
fortress
guarded
by
barriers
of
stone
and
iron
and
watched
by
sentinels
that
never
slept
to
which
she
might
retire
from
his
stratagems
if
there
were
such
a
retreat
it
would
scarcely
avail
her
against
a
foe
circumspect
and
subtle
as
ormond
i
pondered
on
the
condition
of
my
friend
i
reviewed
the
incidents
of
her
life
i
compared
her
lot
with
that
of
others
i
could
not
but
discover
a
sort
of
incurable
malignity
in
her
fate
i
felt
as
if
it
were
denied
to
her
to
enjoy
a
long
life
or
permanent
tranquillity
i
asked
myself
what
she
had
done
entitling
her
to
this
incessant
persecution
impatience
and
murmuring
took
place
of
sorrow
and
fear
in
my
heart
when
i
reflected
that
all
human
agency
was
merely
subservient
to
a
divine
purpose
i
fell
into
fits
of
accusation
and
impiety
this
injustice
was
transient
and
soberer
views
convinced
me
that
every
scheme
comprising
the
whole
must
be
productive
of
partial
and
temporary
evil
the
sufferings
of
constantia
were
limited
to
a
moment
they
were
the
unavoidable
appendages
of
terrestrial
existence
they
formed
the
only
avenue
to
wisdom
and
the
only
claim
to
uninterrupted
fruition
and
eternal
repose
in
an
the
course
of
my
reflections
and
the
issue
to
which
they
led
were
unforeseen
by
myself
fondly
as
i
doted
upon
this
woman
methought
i
could
resign
her
to
the
grave
without
a
murmur
or
a
tear
while
my
thoughts
were
calmed
by
resignation
and
my
fancy
occupied
with
nothing
but
the
briefness
of
that
space
and
evanescence
of
that
time
which
severs
the
living
from
the
dead
i
contemplated
almost
with
complacency
a
violent
or
untimely
close
to
her
existence
this
loftiness
of
mind
could
not
always
be
accomplished
or
constantly
maintained
one
effect
of
my
fears
was
to
hasten
my
departure
to
europe
there
existed
no
impediment
but
the
want
of
a
suitable
conveyance
in
the
first
packet
that
should
leave
america
it
was
determined
to
secure
a
passage
melbourne
consented
to
take
charge
of
property
and
after
the
sale
of
it
to
transmit
to
her
the
money
that
should
thence
arise
meanwhile
i
was
anxious
that
constantia
should
leave
her
present
abode
and
join
me
in
new
york
she
willingly
adopted
this
arrangement
but
conceived
it
necessary
to
spend
a
few
days
at
her
house
in
jersey
she
could
reach
the
latter
place
without
much
deviation
from
the
straight
road
and
she
was
desirous
of
resurveying
a
spot
where
many
of
her
infantile
days
had
been
spent
this
house
and
domain
i
have
already
mentioned
to
have
once
belonged
to
dudley
it
was
selected
with
the
judgement
and
adorned
with
the
taste
of
a
disciple
of
the
schools
of
florence
and
vicenza
in
his
view
cultivation
was
subservient
to
the
picturesque
and
a
mansion
was
erected
eminent
for
nothing
but
chastity
of
ornaments
and
simplicity
of
structure
the
massive
parts
were
of
stone
the
outer
surfaces
were
smooth
and
diversified
by
apertures
and
cornices
in
which
a
cement
uncommonly
tenacious
was
wrought
into
proportions
the
most
correct
and
forms
the
most
graceful
the
floors
walls
and
ceilings
consisted
of
a
still
more
substance
and
were
painted
by
dudley
own
hand
all
appendages
of
this
building
as
seats
tables
and
cabinets
were
modelled
by
the
owner
particular
direction
and
in
a
manner
scrupulously
classical
he
had
scarcely
entered
on
the
enjoyment
of
this
splendid
possession
when
it
was
ravished
away
no
privation
was
endured
with
more
impatience
than
this
but
happily
it
was
purchased
by
one
who
left
arrangements
unmolested
and
who
shortly
after
conveyed
it
entire
to
ormond
by
him
it
was
finally
appropriated
to
the
use
of
helena
cleves
and
now
by
a
singular
contexture
of
events
it
had
reverted
to
those
hands
in
which
the
death
of
the
original
proprietor
if
no
other
change
had
been
made
in
his
condition
would
have
left
it
the
farm
still
remained
in
the
tenure
of
a
german
emigrant
who
held
it
partly
on
condition
of
preserving
the
garden
and
mansion
in
safety
and
in
perfect
order
this
retreat
was
now
revisited
by
constantia
after
an
interval
of
four
years
autumn
had
made
some
progress
but
the
aspect
of
nature
was
so
to
speak
more
significant
than
at
any
other
season
she
was
agreeably
accommodated
under
the
tenant
roof
and
found
a
nameless
pleasure
in
traversing
spaces
in
which
every
object
prompted
an
endless
train
of
recollections
her
sensations
were
not
foreseen
they
led
to
a
state
of
mind
inconsistent
in
some
degree
with
the
projects
adopted
in
obedience
to
the
suggestions
of
a
friend
every
thing
in
this
scene
had
been
created
and
modelled
by
the
genius
of
her
father
it
was
a
kind
of
fane
sanctified
by
his
imaginary
presence
to
consign
the
fruits
of
his
industry
and
invention
to
foreign
and
unsparing
hands
seemed
a
kind
of
sacrilege
for
which
she
almost
feared
that
the
dead
would
rise
to
upbraid
her
those
images
which
bind
us
to
our
natal
soil
to
the
abode
of
our
innocent
and
careless
youth
were
recalled
to
her
fancy
by
the
scenes
which
she
now
beheld
these
were
enforced
by
considerations
of
the
dangers
which
attended
her
voyage
from
storms
and
from
enemies
and
from
the
tendency
to
revolution
and
war
which
seemed
to
actuate
all
the
nations
of
europe
her
native
country
was
by
no
means
exempt
from
similar
tendencies
but
these
evils
were
less
imminent
and
its
manners
and
government
in
their
present
modifications
were
unspeakably
more
favourable
to
the
dignity
and
improvement
of
the
human
race
than
those
which
prevailed
in
any
part
of
the
ancient
world
my
solicitations
and
my
obligation
to
repair
to
england
overweighed
her
objections
but
her
new
reflections
led
her
to
form
new
determinations
with
regard
to
this
part
of
her
property
she
concluded
to
retain
possession
and
hoped
that
some
future
event
would
allow
her
to
return
to
this
favourite
spot
without
forfeiture
of
my
society
an
abode
of
some
years
in
europe
would
more
eminently
qualify
her
for
the
enjoyment
of
retirement
and
safety
in
her
native
country
the
time
that
should
elapse
before
her
embarkation
she
was
desirous
of
passing
among
the
shades
of
this
romantic
retreat
i
was
by
no
means
reconciled
to
this
proceeding
i
loved
my
friend
too
well
to
endure
any
needless
separation
without
repining
in
addition
to
this
the
image
of
ormond
haunted
my
thoughts
and
gave
birth
to
incessant
but
indefinable
fears
i
believed
that
her
safety
would
very
little
depend
upon
the
nature
of
her
abode
or
the
number
or
watchfulness
of
her
companions
my
nearness
to
her
person
would
frustrate
no
stratagem
nor
promote
any
other
end
than
my
own
entanglement
in
the
same
fold
still
that
i
was
not
apprized
each
hour
of
her
condition
that
her
state
was
lonely
and
sequestered
were
sources
of
disquiet
the
obvious
remedy
to
which
was
her
coming
to
new
york
preparations
for
departure
were
assigned
to
me
and
these
required
my
continuance
in
the
city
once
a
week
laffert
her
tenant
visited
for
purposes
of
traffic
the
city
he
was
the
medium
of
our
correspondence
to
him
i
intrusted
a
letter
in
which
my
dissatisfaction
at
her
absence
and
the
causes
which
gave
it
birth
were
freely
confessed
the
confidence
of
safety
seldom
deserted
my
friend
since
her
mysterious
conversation
with
ormond
he
had
utterly
vanished
previous
to
that
interview
his
visits
or
his
letters
were
incessant
and
punctual
but
since
no
token
was
given
that
he
existed
two
months
had
elapsed
he
gave
her
no
reason
to
expect
a
cessation
of
intercourse
he
had
parted
from
her
with
his
usual
abruptness
and
informality
she
did
not
conceive
it
incumbent
on
her
to
search
him
out
but
she
would
not
have
been
displeased
with
an
opportunity
to
discuss
with
him
more
fully
the
motives
of
her
conduct
this
opportunity
had
been
hitherto
denied
her
occupations
in
her
present
retreat
were
for
the
most
part
dictated
by
caprice
or
by
chance
the
mildness
of
autumn
permitted
her
to
ramble
during
the
day
from
one
rock
and
one
grove
to
another
there
was
a
luxury
in
musing
and
in
the
sensations
which
the
scenery
and
silence
produced
which
in
consequence
of
her
long
estrangement
from
them
were
accompanied
with
all
the
attractions
of
novelty
and
from
which
she
would
not
consent
to
withdraw
in
the
evening
she
usually
retired
to
the
mansion
and
shut
herself
up
in
that
apartment
which
in
the
original
structure
of
the
house
had
been
designed
for
study
and
no
part
of
whose
furniture
had
been
removed
or
displaced
it
was
a
kind
of
closet
on
the
second
floor
illuminated
by
a
spacious
window
through
which
a
landscape
of
uncommon
amplitude
and
beauty
was
presented
to
the
view
here
the
pleasures
of
the
day
were
revived
by
recalling
and
enumerating
them
in
letters
to
her
friend
she
always
quitted
this
recess
with
reluctance
and
seldom
till
the
night
was
half
spent
one
evening
she
retired
hither
when
the
sun
had
just
dipped
beneath
the
horizon
her
implements
of
writing
were
prepared
but
before
the
pen
was
assumed
her
eyes
rested
for
a
moment
on
the
variegated
hues
which
were
poured
out
upon
the
western
sky
and
upon
the
scene
of
intermingled
waters
copses
and
fields
the
view
comprised
a
part
of
the
road
which
led
to
this
dwelling
it
was
partially
and
distantly
seen
and
the
passage
of
horses
or
men
was
betokened
chiefly
by
the
dust
which
was
raised
by
their
footsteps
a
token
of
this
kind
now
caught
her
attention
it
fixed
her
eye
chiefly
by
the
picturesque
effect
produced
by
interposing
its
obscurity
between
her
and
the
splendours
which
the
sun
had
left
presently
she
gained
a
faint
view
of
a
man
and
horse
this
circumstance
laid
no
claim
to
attention
and
she
was
withdrawing
her
eye
when
the
stopping
and
dismounting
at
the
gate
made
her
renew
her
scrutiny
this
was
reinforced
by
something
in
the
figure
and
movements
of
the
horseman
which
reminded
her
of
ormond
she
started
from
her
seat
with
some
degree
of
palpitation
whence
this
arose
whether
from
fear
or
from
joy
or
from
intermixed
emotions
it
would
not
be
easy
to
ascertain
having
entered
the
gate
the
visitant
remounting
his
horse
set
the
animal
on
full
speed
every
moment
brought
him
nearer
and
added
to
her
first
belief
he
stopped
not
till
he
reached
the
mansion
the
person
of
ormond
was
distinctly
recognised
an
interview
at
this
dusky
and
lonely
hour
in
circumstances
so
abrupt
and
unexpected
could
not
fail
to
surprise
and
in
some
degree
to
alarm
the
substance
of
his
last
conversation
was
recalled
the
evils
which
were
darkly
and
ambiguously
predicted
thronged
to
her
memory
it
seemed
as
if
the
present
moment
was
to
be
in
some
way
decisive
of
her
fate
this
visit
she
did
not
hesitate
to
suppose
designed
for
her
but
somewhat
uncommonly
momentous
must
have
prompted
him
to
take
so
long
a
journey
the
rooms
on
the
lower
floor
were
dark
the
windows
and
doors
being
fastened
she
had
entered
the
house
by
the
principal
door
and
this
was
the
only
one
at
present
unlocked
the
room
in
which
she
sat
was
over
the
hall
and
the
massive
door
beneath
could
not
be
opened
without
noisy
signals
the
question
that
occurred
to
her
by
what
means
ormond
would
gain
admittance
to
her
presence
she
supposed
would
be
instantly
decided
she
listened
to
hear
his
footsteps
on
the
pavement
or
the
creaking
of
hinges
the
silence
however
continued
profound
as
before
after
a
minute
pause
she
approached
the
window
more
nearly
and
endeavoured
to
gain
a
view
of
the
space
before
the
house
she
saw
nothing
but
the
horse
whose
bridle
was
thrown
over
his
neck
and
who
was
left
at
liberty
to
pick
up
what
scanty
herbage
the
lawn
afforded
to
his
hunger
the
rider
had
disappeared
it
now
occurred
to
her
that
this
visit
had
a
purpose
different
from
that
which
she
at
first
conjectured
it
was
easily
conceived
that
ormond
was
unacquainted
with
her
residence
at
this
spot
the
knowledge
could
only
be
imparted
to
him
by
indirect
or
illicit
means
that
these
means
had
been
employed
by
him
she
was
by
no
means
authorized
to
infer
from
the
silence
and
distance
he
had
lately
maintained
but
if
an
interview
with
her
were
not
the
purpose
of
his
coming
how
should
she
interpret
it
chapter
ix
while
occupied
with
these
reflections
the
light
hastily
disappeared
and
darkness
rendered
by
a
cloudy
atmosphere
uncommonly
intense
succeeded
she
had
the
means
of
lighting
a
lamp
that
hung
against
the
wall
but
had
been
too
much
immersed
in
thought
to
notice
the
deepening
of
the
gloom
recovering
from
her
reverie
she
looked
around
her
with
some
degree
of
trepidation
and
prepared
to
strike
a
spark
that
would
enable
her
to
light
her
lamp
she
had
hitherto
indulged
an
habitual
indifference
to
danger
now
the
presence
of
ormond
the
unknown
purpose
that
led
him
hither
and
the
defencelessness
of
her
condition
inspired
her
with
apprehensions
to
which
she
had
hitherto
been
a
stranger
she
had
been
accustomed
to
pass
many
nocturnal
hours
in
this
closet
till
now
nothing
had
occurred
that
made
her
enter
it
with
circumspection
or
continue
in
it
with
reluctance
her
sensations
were
no
longer
tranquil
each
minute
that
she
spent
in
this
recess
appeared
to
multiply
her
hazards
to
linger
here
appeared
to
her
the
height
of
culpable
temerity
she
hastily
resolved
to
return
to
the
farmer
dwelling
and
on
the
morrow
to
repair
to
new
york
for
this
end
she
was
desirous
to
produce
a
light
the
materials
were
at
hand
she
lifted
her
hand
to
strike
the
flint
when
her
ear
caught
a
sound
which
betokened
the
opening
of
the
door
that
led
into
the
next
apartment
her
motion
was
suspended
and
she
listened
as
well
as
a
throbbing
heart
would
permit
that
ormond
was
the
hand
that
opened
was
the
first
suggestion
of
her
fears
the
motives
of
this
unseasonable
entrance
could
not
be
reconciled
with
her
safety
he
had
given
no
warning
of
his
approach
and
the
door
was
opened
with
tardiness
and
seeming
caution
sounds
continued
of
which
no
distinct
conception
could
be
obtained
or
the
cause
that
produced
them
assigned
the
floors
of
every
apartment
being
composed
like
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
cement
footsteps
were
rendered
almost
undistinguishable
it
was
plain
however
that
some
one
approached
her
own
door
the
panic
and
confusion
that
now
invaded
her
was
owing
to
surprise
and
to
the
singularity
of
her
situation
the
mansion
was
desolate
and
lonely
it
was
night
she
was
immersed
in
darkness
she
had
not
the
means
and
was
unaccustomed
to
the
office
of
repelling
personal
injuries
what
injuries
she
had
reason
to
dread
who
was
the
agent
and
what
were
his
motives
were
subjects
of
vague
and
incoherent
meditation
meanwhile
low
and
imperfect
sounds
that
had
in
them
more
of
inanimate
than
human
assailed
her
ear
presently
they
ceased
an
inexplicable
fear
deterred
her
from
calling
light
would
have
exercised
a
friendly
influence
this
it
was
in
her
power
to
produce
but
not
without
motion
and
noise
and
these
by
occasioning
the
discovery
of
her
being
in
the
closet
might
possibly
enhance
her
danger
conceptions
like
these
were
unworthy
of
the
mind
of
constantia
an
interval
of
silence
succeeded
interrupted
only
by
the
whistling
of
the
blast
without
it
was
sufficient
for
the
restoration
of
her
courage
she
blushed
at
the
cowardice
which
had
trembled
at
a
sound
she
considered
that
ormond
might
indeed
be
near
but
that
he
was
probably
unconscious
of
her
situation
his
coming
was
not
with
the
circumspection
of
an
enemy
he
might
be
acquainted
with
the
place
of
her
retreat
and
had
come
to
obtain
an
interview
with
no
clandestine
or
mysterious
purposes
the
noises
she
had
heard
had
doubtless
proceeded
from
the
next
apartment
but
might
be
produced
by
some
harmless
or
vagrant
creature
these
considerations
restored
her
tranquillity
they
enabled
her
deliberately
to
create
a
light
but
they
did
not
dissuade
her
from
leaving
the
house
omens
of
evil
seemed
to
be
connected
with
this
solitary
and
darksome
abode
besides
ormond
had
unquestionably
entered
upon
this
scene
it
could
not
be
doubted
that
she
was
the
object
of
his
visit
the
was
a
place
of
meeting
more
suitable
and
safe
than
any
other
thither
therefore
she
determined
immediately
to
return
the
closet
had
but
one
door
and
this
led
into
the
chamber
where
the
sounds
had
arisen
through
this
chamber
therefore
she
was
obliged
to
pass
in
order
to
reach
the
staircase
which
terminated
in
the
hall
below
bearing
the
light
in
her
left
hand
she
withdrew
the
bolt
of
the
door
and
opened
in
spite
of
courageous
efforts
she
opened
with
unwillingness
and
shuddered
to
throw
a
glance
forward
or
advance
a
step
into
the
room
this
was
not
needed
to
reveal
to
her
the
cause
of
her
late
disturbance
her
eye
instantly
lighted
on
the
body
of
a
man
supine
motionless
stretched
on
the
floor
close
to
the
door
through
which
she
was
about
to
pass
a
spectacle
like
this
was
qualified
to
startle
her
she
shrunk
back
and
fixed
a
more
steadfast
eye
upon
the
prostrate
person
there
was
no
mark
of
blood
or
of
wounds
but
there
was
something
in
the
attitude
more
significant
of
death
than
of
sleep
his
face
rested
on
the
floor
and
his
ragged
locks
concealed
what
part
of
his
visage
was
not
hidden
by
his
posture
his
garb
was
characterized
by
fashionable
elegance
but
was
polluted
with
dust
the
image
that
first
occurred
to
her
was
that
of
ormond
this
instantly
gave
place
to
another
which
was
familiar
to
her
apprehension
it
was
at
first
too
indistinctly
seen
to
suggest
a
name
she
continued
to
gaze
and
to
be
lost
in
fearful
astonishment
was
this
the
person
whose
entrance
had
been
overheard
and
who
had
dragged
himself
hither
to
die
at
her
door
yet
in
that
case
would
not
groans
and
expiring
efforts
have
testified
his
condition
and
invoked
her
succour
was
he
not
brought
hither
in
the
arms
of
his
assassin
she
mused
upon
the
possible
motives
that
induced
some
one
thus
to
act
and
upon
the
connection
that
might
subsist
between
her
destiny
and
that
of
the
dead
her
meditations
however
fruitless
in
other
respects
could
not
fail
to
show
her
the
propriety
of
hastening
from
this
spot
to
scrutinize
the
form
or
face
of
the
dead
was
a
task
to
which
her
courage
was
unequal
suitably
accompanied
and
guarded
she
would
not
scruple
to
return
and
ascertain
by
the
most
sedulous
examination
the
cause
of
this
ominous
event
she
stepped
over
the
breathless
corpse
and
hurried
to
the
staircase
it
became
her
to
maintain
the
command
of
her
muscles
and
joints
and
to
proceed
without
faltering
or
hesitation
scarcely
had
she
reached
the
entrance
of
the
hall
when
casting
anxious
looks
forward
she
beheld
a
human
figure
no
scrutiny
was
requisite
to
inform
her
that
this
was
ormond
she
stopped
he
approached
her
with
looks
and
gestures
placid
but
solemn
there
was
nothing
in
his
countenance
rugged
or
malignant
on
the
contrary
there
were
tokens
of
compassion
so
said
he
i
expected
to
meet
you
alight
gleaming
from
the
window
marked
you
out
this
and
laffert
directions
have
guided
me
what
said
constantia
with
discomposure
in
her
accent
was
your
motive
for
seeking
me
have
you
forgotten
said
ormond
what
passed
at
our
last
interview
the
evil
that
i
then
predicted
is
at
hand
perhaps
you
were
incredulous
you
accounted
me
a
madman
or
deceiver
now
i
am
come
to
witness
the
fulfilment
of
my
words
and
the
completion
of
your
destiny
to
rescue
you
i
have
not
come
that
is
not
within
the
compass
of
human
powers
poor
constantia
he
continued
in
tones
that
manifested
genuine
sympathy
look
upon
thyself
as
lost
the
toils
that
beset
thee
are
inextricable
summon
up
thy
patience
to
endure
the
evil
now
will
the
last
and
heaviest
trial
betide
thy
fortitude
i
could
weep
for
thee
if
my
manly
nature
would
permit
this
is
the
scene
of
thy
calamity
and
this
the
hour
these
words
were
adapted
to
excite
curiosity
mingled
with
terror
ormond
deportment
was
of
an
unexampled
tenor
as
well
as
that
evil
which
he
had
so
ambiguously
predicted
he
offered
no
protection
from
danger
and
yet
gave
no
proof
of
being
himself
an
agent
or
auxiliary
after
a
minute
pause
constantia
recovering
a
firm
tone
said
ormond
your
recent
deportment
but
ill
accords
with
your
professions
of
sincerity
and
plain
dealing
what
your
purpose
is
or
whether
you
have
any
purpose
i
am
at
a
loss
to
conjecture
whether
you
most
deserve
censure
or
ridicule
is
a
point
which
you
afford
me
not
the
means
of
deciding
and
to
which
unless
on
your
own
account
i
am
indifferent
if
you
are
willing
to
be
more
explicit
or
if
there
be
any
topic
on
which
you
wish
further
to
converse
i
will
not
refuse
your
company
to
laffert
dwelling
longer
to
remain
here
would
be
indiscreet
and
absurd
so
saying
she
motioned
towards
the
door
ormond
was
passive
and
seemed
indisposed
to
prevent
her
departure
till
she
laid
her
hand
upon
the
lock
he
then
without
moving
from
his
place
exclaimed
stay
must
this
meeting
which
fate
ordains
to
be
the
last
be
so
short
must
a
time
and
place
so
suitable
for
what
remains
to
be
said
and
done
be
neglected
or
misused
no
you
charge
me
with
duplicity
and
deem
my
conduct
either
ridiculous
or
criminal
i
have
stated
my
reasons
for
concealment
but
these
have
failed
to
convince
you
well
here
is
now
an
end
to
doubt
all
ambiguities
are
preparing
to
vanish
when
ormond
began
to
speak
constantia
paused
to
hearken
to
him
his
vehemence
was
not
of
that
nature
which
threatened
to
obstruct
her
passage
it
was
by
entreaty
that
he
apparently
endeavoured
to
detain
her
steps
and
not
by
violence
hence
arose
her
patience
to
listen
he
continued
constantia
thy
father
is
dead
art
thou
not
desirous
of
detecting
the
author
of
his
fate
will
it
afford
thee
no
consolation
to
know
that
the
deed
is
punished
wilt
thou
suffer
me
to
drag
the
murderer
to
thy
feet
thy
justice
will
be
gratified
by
this
sacrifice
somewhat
will
be
due
to
him
who
avenged
thy
wrong
in
the
blood
of
the
perpetrator
what
sayest
thou
grant
me
thy
permission
and
in
a
moment
i
will
drag
him
hither
these
words
called
up
the
image
of
the
person
whose
corpse
she
had
lately
seen
it
was
readily
conceived
that
to
him
ormond
alluded
but
this
was
the
assassin
of
her
father
and
his
crime
had
been
detected
and
punished
by
ormond
these
images
had
no
other
effect
than
to
urge
her
departure
she
again
applied
her
hand
to
the
lock
and
said
this
scene
must
not
be
prolonged
my
father
death
i
desire
not
to
hear
explained
or
to
see
revenged
but
whatever
information
you
are
willing
or
able
to
communicate
must
be
deferred
nay
interrupted
ormond
with
augmented
vehemence
art
thou
equally
devoid
of
curiosity
and
justice
thinkest
thou
that
the
enmity
which
bereft
thy
father
of
life
will
not
seek
thy
own
there
are
evils
which
i
can
not
prevent
thee
from
enduring
but
there
are
likewise
ills
which
my
counsel
will
enable
thee
and
thy
friend
to
shun
save
me
from
witnessing
thy
death
thy
father
destiny
is
sealed
all
that
remained
was
to
punish
his
assassin
but
thou
and
thy
sophia
still
live
why
should
ye
perish
by
a
like
stroke
this
intimation
was
sufficient
to
arrest
the
steps
of
constantia
she
withdrew
her
hand
from
the
door
and
fixed
eyes
of
the
deepest
anxiety
on
ormond
what
mean
you
how
am
i
to
understand
ah
said
ormond
i
see
thou
wilt
consent
to
stay
thy
detention
shall
not
be
long
remain
where
thou
art
during
one
moment
merely
while
i
drag
hither
thy
enemy
and
show
thee
a
visage
which
thou
wilt
not
be
slow
to
recognise
saying
this
he
hastily
ascended
the
staircase
and
quickly
passed
beyond
her
sight
deportment
thus
mysterious
could
not
fail
of
bewildering
her
thoughts
there
was
somewhat
in
the
looks
and
accents
of
ormond
different
from
former
appearances
tokens
of
a
hidden
purpose
and
a
smothered
meaning
were
perceptible
a
mixture
of
the
inoffensive
and
the
lawless
which
added
to
the
loneliness
and
silence
that
encompassed
her
produced
a
faltering
emotion
her
curiosity
was
overpowered
by
her
fear
and
the
resolution
was
suddenly
conceived
of
seizing
this
opportunity
to
escape
a
third
time
she
put
her
hand
to
the
lock
and
attempted
to
open
the
effort
was
ineffectual
the
door
that
was
accustomed
to
obey
the
gentlest
touch
was
now
immovable
she
had
lately
unlocked
and
passed
through
it
her
eager
inspection
convinced
her
that
the
principal
bolt
was
still
withdrawn
but
a
small
one
was
now
perceived
of
whose
existence
she
had
not
been
apprized
and
over
which
her
key
had
no
power
now
did
she
first
harbour
a
fear
that
was
intelligible
in
its
dictates
now
did
she
first
perceive
herself
sinking
in
the
toils
of
some
lurking
enemy
hope
whispered
that
this
foe
was
not
ormond
his
conduct
had
bespoken
no
willingness
to
put
constraint
upon
her
steps
he
talked
not
as
if
he
was
aware
of
this
obstruction
and
yet
his
seeming
acquiescence
might
have
flowed
from
a
knowledge
that
she
had
no
power
to
remove
beyond
his
reach
he
warned
her
of
danger
to
her
life
of
which
he
was
her
rescuer
his
counsel
was
to
arm
her
with
sufficient
caution
the
peril
that
awaited
her
was
imminent
this
was
the
time
and
place
of
its
occurrence
and
here
she
was
compelled
to
remain
till
the
power
that
fastened
would
condescend
to
loose
the
door
there
were
other
avenues
to
the
hall
these
were
accustomed
to
be
locked
but
ormond
had
found
access
and
if
all
continued
fast
it
was
incontestable
that
he
was
the
author
of
this
new
impediment
the
other
avenues
were
hastily
examined
all
were
bolted
and
locked
the
first
impulse
led
her
to
call
for
help
from
without
but
the
mansion
was
distant
from
laffert
habitation
this
spot
was
wholly
unfrequented
no
passenger
was
likely
to
be
stationed
where
her
call
could
be
heard
besides
this
forcible
detention
might
operate
for
a
short
time
and
be
attended
with
no
mischievous
consequences
whatever
was
to
come
it
was
her
duty
to
collect
her
courage
and
encounter
it
tho
steps
of
ormond
above
now
gave
tokens
of
his
approach
vigilant
observance
of
this
man
was
all
that
her
situation
permitted
a
vehement
effort
restored
her
to
some
degree
of
composure
her
stifled
palpitations
allowed
her
steadfastly
to
notice
him
as
he
now
descended
the
stairs
bearing
a
lifeless
body
in
his
arms
there
said
he
as
he
cast
it
at
her
feet
whose
countenance
is
that
who
would
imagine
that
features
like
those
belonged
to
an
assassin
and
impostor
closed
eyelids
and
fallen
muscles
could
not
hide
from
her
lineaments
so
often
seen
she
shrunk
back
and
exclaimed
thomas
craig
a
pause
succeeded
in
which
she
alternately
gazed
at
the
countenance
of
this
unfortunate
wretch
and
at
ormond
at
length
the
latter
exclaimed
well
my
girl
hast
thou
examined
him
dost
thou
recognise
a
friend
or
an
enemy
i
know
him
well
but
how
came
this
what
purpose
brought
him
hither
who
was
the
author
of
his
fate
have
i
not
already
told
thee
that
ormond
was
his
own
avenger
and
thine
to
thee
and
to
me
he
has
been
a
robber
to
him
thy
father
is
indebted
for
the
loss
not
only
of
property
but
life
did
crimes
like
these
merit
a
less
punishment
and
what
recompense
is
due
to
him
whose
vigilance
pursued
him
hither
and
made
him
pay
for
his
offences
with
his
blood
what
benefit
have
i
received
at
thy
hand
to
authorize
me
for
thy
sake
to
take
away
his
life
no
benefit
received
from
me
said
constantia
would
justify
such
an
act
i
should
have
abhorred
myself
for
annexing
to
my
benefits
so
bloody
a
condition
it
calls
for
no
gratitude
or
recompense
its
suitable
attendant
is
remorse
that
he
is
a
thief
i
know
but
too
well
that
my
father
died
by
his
hand
is
incredible
no
motives
or
means
why
so
interrupted
ormond
does
not
sleep
seal
up
the
senses
can
not
closets
be
unlocked
at
midnight
can
not
adjoining
houses
communicate
by
doors
can
not
these
doors
be
hidden
from
suspicion
by
a
sheet
of
canvas
these
words
were
of
startling
and
abundant
import
they
reminded
her
of
circumstances
in
her
father
chamber
which
sufficiently
explained
the
means
by
which
his
life
was
assailed
the
closet
and
its
wall
the
adjoining
house
untenanted
and
shut
up
but
this
house
though
unoccupied
belonged
to
ormond
from
the
inferences
which
flowed
hence
her
attention
was
withdrawn
by
her
companion
who
continued
do
these
means
imply
the
interposal
of
a
miracle
his
motives
what
scruples
can
be
expected
from
a
man
inured
from
infancy
to
cunning
and
pillage
will
he
abstain
from
murder
when
urged
by
excruciating
poverty
by
menaces
of
persecution
by
terror
of
expiring
on
the
gallows
tumultuous
suspicions
were
now
awakened
in
the
mind
of
constantia
her
faltering
voice
scarcely
allowed
her
to
ask
how
know
that
craig
was
thus
guilty
that
these
were
his
incitements
and
means
ormond
solemnity
now
gave
place
to
a
tone
of
sarcasm
and
looks
of
exultation
poor
constantia
thou
art
still
pestered
with
incredulity
and
doubts
my
veracity
is
still
in
question
my
knowledge
girl
is
infallible
that
these
were
his
means
of
access
i
can
not
be
ignorant
for
i
pointed
them
out
he
was
urged
by
these
motives
for
they
were
stated
and
enforced
by
me
his
was
the
deed
for
i
stood
beside
him
when
it
was
done
these
indeed
were
terms
that
stood
in
no
need
of
further
explanation
the
veil
that
shrouded
this
formidable
being
was
lifted
high
enough
to
make
him
be
regarded
with
inexplicable
horror
what
his
future
acts
should
be
how
his
omens
of
ill
were
to
be
solved
were
still
involved
in
uncertainty
in
the
midst
of
fears
for
her
own
safety
by
which
constantia
was
now
assailed
the
image
of
her
father
was
revived
keen
regret
and
vehement
upbraiding
were
conjured
up
craig
then
was
the
instrument
and
yours
the
instigation
that
destroyed
my
father
in
what
had
he
offended
you
what
cause
had
he
given
for
resentment
cause
replied
he
with
impetuous
accents
resentment
none
my
motive
was
benevolent
my
deed
conferred
a
benefit
i
gave
him
sight
and
took
away
his
life
from
motives
equally
wise
know
you
not
that
ormond
was
fool
enough
to
set
value
on
the
affections
of
a
woman
these
were
sought
with
preposterous
anxiety
and
endless
labour
among
other
facilitators
of
his
purpose
he
summoned
gratitude
to
his
aid
to
snatch
you
from
poverty
to
restore
his
sight
to
your
father
were
expected
to
operate
as
incentives
to
love
but
here
i
was
the
dupe
of
error
a
thousand
prejudices
stood
in
my
way
these
provided
our
intercourse
were
not
obstructed
i
hoped
to
subdue
the
rage
of
innovation
seized
your
father
this
blended
with
a
mortal
antipathy
to
me
made
him
labour
to
seduce
you
from
the
bosom
of
your
peaceful
country
to
make
you
enter
on
a
boisterous
sea
to
visit
lands
where
all
is
havoc
and
hostility
to
snatch
you
from
the
influence
of
my
arguments
this
new
obstacle
i
was
bound
to
remove
while
revolving
the
means
chance
and
his
evil
destiny
threw
craig
in
my
way
i
soon
convinced
him
that
his
reputation
and
his
life
were
in
my
hands
his
retention
of
these
depended
upon
my
will
on
the
performance
of
conditions
which
i
prescribed
my
happiness
and
yours
depended
on
your
concurrence
with
my
wishes
your
father
life
was
an
obstacle
to
your
concurrence
for
killing
him
therefore
i
may
claim
your
gratitude
his
death
was
a
due
and
disinterested
offering
at
the
altar
of
your
felicity
and
mine
my
deed
was
not
injurious
to
him
at
his
age
death
whose
coming
at
some
period
is
inevitable
could
not
be
distant
to
make
it
unforeseen
and
brief
and
void
of
pain
to
preclude
the
torments
of
a
lingering
malady
a
slow
and
visible
descent
to
the
grave
was
the
dictate
of
beneficence
but
of
what
value
was
a
continuance
of
his
life
either
you
would
have
gone
with
him
to
europe
or
have
stayed
at
home
with
me
in
the
first
case
his
life
would
have
been
rapidly
consumed
by
perils
and
cares
in
the
second
separation
from
you
and
union
with
me
a
being
so
detestable
would
equally
have
poisoned
his
existence
craig
cowardice
and
crimes
made
him
a
pliant
and
commodious
tool
i
pointed
out
the
way
the
unsuspected
door
which
led
into
the
closet
of
your
father
chamber
was
made
by
my
direction
during
the
life
of
helena
by
this
avenue
i
was
wont
to
post
myself
where
all
your
conversations
could
be
overheard
by
this
avenue
an
entrance
and
retreat
were
afforded
to
the
agent
of
my
newest
purpose
fool
that
i
was
i
solaced
myself
with
the
belief
that
all
impediments
were
now
smoothed
when
a
new
enemy
appeared
my
folly
lasted
as
long
as
my
hope
i
saw
that
to
gain
your
affections
fortified
by
antiquated
scruples
and
obsequious
to
the
guidance
of
this
new
monitor
was
impossible
it
is
not
my
way
to
toil
after
that
which
is
beyond
my
reach
if
the
greater
good
be
inaccessible
i
learn
to
be
contented
with
the
less
i
have
served
you
with
successless
sedulity
i
have
set
an
engine
in
act
to
obliterate
an
obstacle
to
your
felicity
and
lay
your
father
at
rest
under
my
guidance
this
engine
was
productive
only
of
good
governed
by
itself
or
by
another
it
will
only
work
you
harm
i
have
therefore
hastened
to
destroy
it
lo
it
is
now
before
you
motionless
and
impotent
for
this
complexity
of
benefit
i
look
for
no
reward
i
am
not
tired
of
having
ceased
to
labour
for
an
unattainable
good
i
have
come
hither
to
possess
myself
of
all
that
i
now
crave
and
by
the
same
deed
to
afford
you
an
illustrious
opportunity
to
signalize
your
wisdom
and
your
fortitude
during
this
speech
the
mind
of
constantia
became
more
deeply
pervaded
with
dread
of
some
overhanging
but
incomprehensible
evil
the
strongest
impulse
was
to
gain
a
safe
asylum
at
a
distance
from
this
spot
and
from
the
presence
of
this
extraordinary
being
this
impulse
was
followed
by
the
recollection
that
her
liberty
was
taken
away
that
egress
from
the
hall
was
denied
her
and
that
this
restriction
might
be
part
of
some
conspiracy
of
ormond
against
her
life
security
from
danger
like
this
would
be
in
the
first
place
sought
by
one
of
constantia
sex
and
opinions
in
flight
this
had
been
rendered
by
some
fatal
chance
or
by
the
precautions
of
her
foe
impracticable
stratagem
or
force
was
all
that
remained
to
elude
or
disarm
her
adversary
for
the
contrivance
and
execution
of
fraud
all
the
habits
of
her
life
and
all
the
maxims
of
her
education
had
conspired
to
unfit
her
her
force
of
muscles
would
avail
her
nothing
against
the
superior
energy
of
ormond
she
remembered
that
to
inflict
death
was
no
iniquitous
exertion
of
and
that
the
penknife
which
she
held
in
her
hand
was
capable
of
this
service
she
had
used
it
to
remove
any
lurking
obstruction
in
the
wards
of
her
key
supposing
for
a
time
this
to
be
the
cause
of
her
failing
to
withdraw
the
bolt
of
the
door
this
resource
was
indeed
scarcely
less
disastrous
and
deplorable
than
any
fate
from
which
it
could
rescue
her
some
uncertainty
still
involved
the
intentions
of
ormond
as
soon
as
he
paused
she
spoke
how
am
i
to
understand
this
prelude
let
me
know
the
full
extent
of
my
danger
why
it
is
that
i
am
hindered
from
leaving
this
house
and
why
this
interview
was
sought
ah
constantia
this
indeed
is
merely
a
prelude
to
a
scene
that
is
to
terminate
my
influence
over
thy
fate
when
this
is
past
i
have
sworn
to
part
with
thee
forever
art
thou
still
dubious
of
my
purpose
art
thou
not
a
woman
and
have
i
not
entreated
for
thy
love
and
been
rejected
canst
thou
imagine
that
i
aim
at
thy
life
my
avowals
of
love
were
sincere
my
passion
was
vehement
and
undisguised
it
gave
dignity
and
value
to
a
gift
in
thy
power
as
a
woman
to
bestow
this
has
been
denied
that
gift
has
lost
none
of
its
value
in
my
eyes
what
thou
refusest
to
bestow
it
is
in
my
power
to
extort
i
came
for
that
end
when
this
end
is
accomplished
i
will
restore
thee
to
liberty
these
words
were
accompanied
by
looks
that
rendered
all
explanation
of
their
meaning
useless
the
evil
reserved
for
her
hitherto
obscured
by
and
contradictory
attributes
was
now
sufficiently
apparent
the
truth
in
this
respect
unveiled
itself
with
the
rapidity
and
brightness
of
an
electrical
flash
she
was
silent
she
cast
her
eyes
at
the
windows
and
doors
escape
through
them
was
hopeless
she
looked
at
those
lineaments
of
ormond
which
evinced
his
disdain
of
supplication
and
inexorable
passions
she
felt
that
entreaty
and
argument
would
be
vain
that
all
appeals
to
his
compassion
and
benevolence
would
counteract
her
purpose
since
in
the
unexampled
conformation
of
this
man
mind
these
principles
were
made
subservient
to
his
most
flagitious
designs
considerations
of
justice
and
pity
were
made
by
a
fatal
perverseness
of
reasoning
champions
and
bulwarks
of
his
most
atrocious
mistakes
the
last
extremes
of
opposition
the
most
violent
expedients
for
defence
would
be
justified
by
being
indispensable
to
find
safety
for
her
honour
even
in
the
blood
of
an
assailant
was
the
prescription
of
duty
tho
equity
of
this
species
of
defence
was
not
in
the
present
confusion
of
her
mind
a
subject
of
momentary
doubt
to
forewarn
him
of
her
desperate
purpose
would
be
to
furnish
him
with
means
of
counteraction
her
weapon
would
easily
be
wrested
from
her
feeble
hand
ineffectual
opposition
would
only
precipitate
her
evil
destiny
a
rage
contented
with
nothing
less
than
her
life
might
be
awakened
in
his
bosom
but
was
not
this
to
be
desired
death
untimely
and
violent
was
better
than
the
loss
of
honour
this
thought
led
to
a
new
series
of
reflections
she
involuntarily
shrunk
from
the
act
of
killing
but
would
her
efforts
to
destroy
her
adversary
be
effectual
would
not
his
strength
and
dexterity
easily
repel
or
elude
them
her
power
in
this
respect
was
questionable
but
her
power
was
undeniably
sufficient
to
a
different
end
the
instrument
which
could
not
rescue
her
from
this
injury
by
the
destruction
of
another
might
save
her
from
it
by
her
own
destruction
these
thoughts
rapidly
occurred
but
the
resolution
to
which
they
led
was
scarcely
formed
when
ormond
advanced
towards
her
she
recoiled
a
few
steps
and
showing
the
knife
which
she
held
said
ormond
beware
know
that
my
unalterable
resolution
is
to
die
uninjured
i
have
the
means
in
my
power
stop
where
you
are
one
step
more
and
i
plunge
this
knife
into
my
heart
i
know
that
to
contend
with
your
strength
or
your
reason
would
be
vain
to
turn
this
weapon
against
you
i
should
not
fear
if
i
were
sure
of
success
but
to
that
i
will
not
trust
to
save
a
greater
good
by
the
sacrifice
of
life
is
in
my
power
and
that
sacrifice
shall
be
made
poor
constantia
replied
ormond
in
a
tone
of
contempt
so
thou
preferrest
thy
imaginary
honour
to
life
to
escape
this
injury
without
a
name
or
substance
without
connection
with
the
past
or
future
without
contamination
of
thy
purity
or
thraldom
of
thy
will
thou
wilt
kill
thyself
put
an
end
to
thy
activity
in
virtue
cause
rob
thy
friend
of
her
solace
the
world
of
thy
beneficence
thyself
of
being
and
pleasure
i
shall
be
grieved
for
the
fatal
issue
of
my
experiment
i
shall
mourn
over
thy
martyrdom
to
the
most
opprobrious
and
contemptible
of
all
errors
but
that
thou
shouldst
undergo
the
trial
is
decreed
there
is
still
an
interval
of
hope
that
thy
cowardice
is
counterfeited
or
that
it
will
give
place
to
wisdom
and
courage
whatever
thou
intendest
by
way
of
prevention
or
cure
it
behooves
thee
to
employ
with
steadfastness
die
with
the
guilt
of
suicide
and
the
brand
of
cowardice
upon
thy
memory
or
live
with
thy
claims
to
felicity
and
approbation
undiminished
choose
which
thou
wilt
thy
decision
is
of
moment
to
thyself
but
of
none
to
me
living
or
dead
the
prize
that
i
have
in
view
shall
be
mine
chapter
x
it
will
be
requisite
to
withdraw
your
attention
from
this
scene
for
a
moment
and
fix
it
on
myself
my
impatience
of
my
friend
delay
for
some
days
preceding
this
disastrous
interview
became
continually
more
painful
as
the
time
of
our
departure
approached
my
dread
of
some
misfortune
or
impediment
increased
ormond
disappearance
from
the
scene
contributed
but
little
to
my
consolation
to
wrap
his
purposes
in
mystery
to
place
himself
at
seeming
distance
was
the
usual
artifice
of
such
as
he
was
necessary
to
the
maturing
of
his
project
and
the
hopeless
entanglement
of
his
victim
i
saw
no
means
of
placing
the
safety
of
my
friend
beyond
his
reach
between
different
methods
of
procedure
there
was
however
room
for
choice
her
present
abode
was
more
hazardous
than
an
abode
in
the
city
to
be
alone
argued
a
state
more
defenceless
and
perilous
than
to
be
attended
by
me
i
wrote
her
an
urgent
admonition
to
return
my
remonstrances
were
couched
in
such
terms
as
in
my
own
opinion
laid
her
under
the
necessity
of
immediate
compliance
the
letter
was
despatched
by
the
usual
messenger
and
for
some
hours
i
solaced
myself
with
the
prospect
of
a
speedy
meeting
these
thoughts
gave
place
to
doubt
and
apprehension
i
began
to
distrust
the
efficacy
of
my
arguments
and
to
invent
a
thousand
reasons
inducing
her
in
defiance
of
my
rhetoric
at
least
to
protract
her
absence
these
reasons
i
had
not
previously
conceived
and
had
not
therefore
attempted
in
my
letter
to
invalidate
their
force
this
omission
was
possible
to
be
supplied
in
a
second
epistle
but
meanwhile
time
would
be
lost
and
my
new
arguments
might
like
the
old
fail
to
convince
her
at
least
the
tongue
was
a
much
more
versatile
and
powerful
advocate
than
the
pen
and
by
hastening
to
her
habitation
i
might
either
compel
her
to
return
with
me
or
ward
off
danger
by
my
presence
or
share
it
with
her
i
finally
resolved
to
join
her
by
the
speediest
conveyance
this
resolution
was
suggested
by
the
meditations
of
a
sleepless
night
i
rose
with
the
dawn
and
sought
out
the
means
of
transporting
myself
with
most
celerity
to
the
abode
of
my
friend
a
accustomed
twice
a
day
to
cross
new
york
bay
to
staten
island
was
prevailed
upon
by
liberal
offers
to
set
out
upon
the
voyage
at
the
dawn
of
day
the
sky
was
gloomy
and
the
air
boisterous
and
unsettled
the
wind
suddenly
becoming
tempestuous
and
adverse
rendered
the
voyage
at
once
tedious
and
full
of
peril
a
voyage
of
nine
miles
was
not
effected
in
less
than
eight
hours
and
without
imminent
and
hairbreadth
danger
of
being
drowned
fifteen
miles
of
the
journey
remained
to
be
performed
by
land
a
carriage
with
the
utmost
difficulty
was
procured
but
lank
horses
and
a
crazy
vehicle
were
but
little
in
unison
with
my
impatience
we
reached
not
amboy
ferry
till
some
hours
after
nightfall
i
was
rowed
across
the
sound
and
proceeded
to
accomplish
the
remainder
of
my
journey
about
three
miles
on
foot
i
was
actuated
to
this
speed
by
indefinite
but
powerful
motives
the
belief
that
my
speedy
arrival
was
essential
to
the
rescue
of
my
friend
from
some
inexplicable
injury
haunted
me
with
ceaseless
importunity
on
no
account
would
i
have
consented
to
postpone
this
precipitate
expedition
till
the
morrow
i
at
length
arrived
at
dudley
the
inhabitants
were
struck
with
wonder
at
the
sight
of
me
my
clothes
were
stained
by
the
water
by
which
every
passenger
was
copiously
sprinkled
during
our
boisterous
navigation
and
soiled
by
dust
my
frame
was
almost
overpowered
by
fatigue
and
abstinence
to
my
anxious
inquiries
respecting
my
friend
they
told
me
that
her
evenings
were
usually
spent
at
the
mansion
where
it
was
probable
she
was
now
to
be
found
they
were
not
apprized
of
any
inconvenience
or
danger
that
betided
her
it
was
her
custom
sometimes
to
prolong
her
absence
till
midnight
i
could
not
applaud
the
discretion
nor
censure
the
temerity
of
this
proceeding
my
mind
was
harassed
by
unintelligible
omens
and
fears
to
obviate
the
danger
and
to
banish
my
inquietudes
was
my
first
duty
for
this
end
i
hastened
to
the
mansion
having
passed
the
intervening
hillocks
and
copses
i
gained
a
view
of
the
front
of
the
building
my
heart
suddenly
sunk
on
observing
that
no
apartment
not
even
that
in
which
i
knew
it
was
her
custom
to
sit
at
these
unseasonable
hours
was
illuminated
a
gleam
from
the
window
of
the
study
i
should
have
regarded
as
an
argument
at
once
of
her
presence
and
her
safety
i
approached
the
house
with
misgiving
and
faltering
steps
the
gate
leading
into
a
spacious
court
was
open
a
sound
on
one
side
attracted
my
attention
in
the
present
state
of
my
thoughts
any
near
or
unexplained
sound
sufficed
to
startle
me
looking
towards
the
quarter
whence
my
panic
was
excited
i
espied
through
the
dusk
a
horse
grazing
with
his
bridle
thrown
over
his
neck
this
appearance
was
a
new
source
of
perplexity
and
alarm
the
inference
was
unavoidable
that
a
visitant
was
here
who
that
visitant
was
and
how
he
was
now
employed
was
a
subject
of
eager
but
fruitless
curiosity
within
and
around
the
mansion
all
was
buried
in
the
deepest
repose
i
now
approached
the
principal
door
and
looking
through
the
keyhole
perceived
a
lamp
standing
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
staircase
it
shed
a
pale
light
over
the
lofty
ceiling
and
marble
balustrades
no
face
or
movement
of
a
human
being
was
perceptible
these
tokens
assured
me
that
some
one
was
within
they
also
accounted
for
the
of
light
at
the
window
above
i
withdrew
my
eye
from
this
avenue
and
was
preparing
to
knock
loudly
for
admission
when
my
attention
was
awakened
by
some
one
who
advanced
to
the
door
from
the
inside
and
seemed
busily
engaged
in
unlocking
i
started
back
and
waited
with
impatience
till
the
door
should
open
and
the
person
issue
forth
presently
i
heard
a
voice
within
exclaim
in
accents
of
mingled
terror
and
grief
oh
what
what
will
become
of
me
shall
i
never
be
released
from
this
detested
prison
the
voice
was
that
of
constantia
it
penetrated
to
my
heart
like
an
icebolt
i
once
more
darted
a
glance
through
the
crevice
a
figure
with
difficulty
recognised
to
be
that
of
my
friend
now
appeared
in
sight
her
hands
were
clasped
on
her
breast
her
eyes
wildly
fixed
upon
the
ceiling
and
streaming
with
tears
and
her
hair
unbound
and
falling
confusedly
over
her
bosom
and
neck
my
sensations
scarcely
permitted
me
to
call
constantia
for
sake
what
has
happened
to
you
open
the
door
i
beseech
you
what
voice
is
that
sophia
courtland
o
my
friend
i
am
imprisoned
some
demon
has
barred
the
door
beyond
my
power
to
unfasten
ah
why
comest
thou
so
late
thy
succour
would
have
somewhat
profited
if
sooner
given
but
now
the
lost
constantia
here
her
voice
sunk
into
convulsive
sobs
in
the
midst
of
my
own
despair
on
perceiving
the
fulfilment
of
my
apprehensions
and
what
i
regarded
as
the
fatal
execution
of
some
project
of
ormond
i
was
not
insensible
to
the
suggestions
of
prudence
i
entreated
my
friend
to
retain
her
courage
while
i
flew
to
and
returned
with
suitable
assistance
to
burst
open
the
door
the
people
of
the
readily
obeyed
my
summons
accompanied
by
three
men
of
powerful
sinews
sons
and
servants
of
the
farmer
i
returned
with
the
utmost
expedition
to
the
mansion
the
lamp
still
remained
in
its
former
place
but
our
loudest
calls
were
unanswered
the
silence
was
uninterrupted
and
profound
the
door
yielded
to
strenuous
and
repeated
efforts
and
i
rushed
into
the
hall
the
first
object
that
met
my
sight
was
my
friend
stretched
upon
the
floor
pale
and
motionless
supine
and
with
all
the
tokens
of
death
from
this
object
my
attention
was
speedily
attracted
by
two
figures
breathless
and
supine
like
that
of
constantia
one
of
them
was
ormond
a
smile
of
disdain
still
sat
upon
his
features
the
wound
by
which
he
fell
was
secret
and
was
scarcely
betrayed
by
the
effusion
of
a
drop
of
blood
the
face
of
the
third
victim
was
familiar
to
my
early
days
it
was
that
of
the
impostor
whose
artifice
had
torn
from
dudley
his
peace
and
fortune
an
explication
of
this
scene
was
hopeless
by
what
disastrous
and
inscrutable
fate
a
place
like
this
became
the
scene
of
such
complicated
havoc
to
whom
craig
was
indebted
for
his
death
what
evil
had
been
meditated
or
inflicted
by
ormond
and
by
what
means
his
project
had
arrived
at
this
bloody
consummation
were
topics
of
wild
and
fearful
conjecture
but
my
friend
the
first
impulse
of
my
fears
was
to
regard
her
as
dead
hope
and
a
closer
observation
outrooted
or
at
least
suspended
this
opinion
one
of
the
men
lifted
her
in
his
arms
no
trace
of
blood
or
mark
of
fatal
violence
was
discoverable
and
the
effusion
of
cold
water
restored
her
though
slowly
to
life
to
withdraw
her
from
this
spectacle
of
death
was
my
first
care
she
suffered
herself
to
be
led
to
the
she
was
carried
to
her
chamber
for
a
time
she
appeared
incapable
of
recollection
she
grasped
my
hand
as
i
sat
by
her
bedside
but
scarcely
gave
any
other
tokens
of
life
from
this
state
of
inactivity
she
gradually
recovered
i
was
actuated
by
a
thousand
forebodings
but
refrained
from
molesting
her
by
interrogation
or
condolence
i
watched
by
her
side
in
silence
but
was
eager
to
collect
from
her
own
lips
an
account
of
this
mysterious
transaction
at
length
she
opened
her
eyes
and
appeared
to
recollect
her
present
situation
and
the
events
which
led
to
it
i
inquired
into
her
condition
and
asked
if
there
were
any
thing
in
my
power
to
procure
or
perform
for
her
oh
my
friend
she
answered
what
have
i
done
what
have
i
suffered
within
the
last
dreadful
hour
the
remembrance
though
insupportable
will
never
leave
me
you
can
do
nothing
for
my
relief
all
i
claim
is
your
compassion
and
your
sympathy
i
hope
said
i
that
nothing
has
happened
to
load
you
with
guilt
or
with
shame
alas
i
know
not
my
deed
was
scarcely
the
fruit
of
intention
it
was
suggested
by
a
momentary
frenzy
i
saw
no
other
means
of
escaping
from
vileness
and
pollution
i
was
menaced
with
an
evil
worse
than
death
i
forebore
till
my
strength
was
almost
subdued
the
lapse
of
another
moment
would
have
placed
me
beyond
hope
my
stroke
was
desperate
and
at
random
it
answered
my
purpose
too
well
he
cast
at
me
a
look
of
terrible
upbraiding
but
spoke
not
his
heart
was
pierced
and
he
sunk
as
if
struck
by
lightning
at
my
feet
o
much
erring
and
unhappy
ormond
that
thou
shouldst
thus
untimely
perish
that
i
should
be
thy
executioner
these
words
sufficiently
explained
the
scene
that
i
had
witnessed
the
violence
of
ormond
had
been
repulsed
by
equal
violence
his
foul
attempts
had
been
prevented
by
his
death
not
to
deplore
the
necessity
which
had
produced
this
act
was
impossible
but
since
this
necessity
existed
it
was
surely
not
a
deed
to
be
thought
upon
with
lasting
horror
or
to
be
allowed
to
generate
remorse
in
consequence
of
this
catastrophe
arduous
duties
had
devolved
upon
me
the
people
that
surrounded
me
were
powerless
with
terror
their
ignorance
and
cowardice
left
them
at
a
loss
how
to
act
in
this
emergency
they
besought
my
direction
and
willingly
performed
whatever
i
thought
proper
to
enjoin
upon
them
no
deliberation
was
necessary
to
acquaint
me
with
my
duty
laffert
was
despatched
to
the
nearest
magistrate
with
a
letter
in
which
his
immediate
presence
was
entreated
and
these
transactions
were
briefly
explained
early
the
next
day
the
formalities
of
justice
in
the
inspection
of
the
bodies
and
the
examination
of
witnesses
were
executed
it
would
be
needless
to
dwell
on
the
particulars
of
this
catastrophe
a
sufficient
explanation
has
been
given
of
the
causes
that
led
to
it
they
were
such
as
exempted
my
friend
from
legal
animadversion
her
act
was
prompted
by
motives
which
every
scheme
of
jurisprudence
known
in
the
world
not
only
exculpates
but
applauds
to
state
these
motives
before
a
tribunal
hastily
formed
and
exercising
its
functions
on
the
spot
was
a
task
not
to
be
avoided
though
infinitely
painful
remonstrances
the
most
urgent
and
pathetic
could
scarcely
conquer
her
reluctance
this
task
however
was
easy
in
comparison
with
that
which
remained
to
restore
health
and
equanimity
to
my
friend
to
repel
the
erroneous
accusations
of
her
conscience
to
hinder
her
from
musing
with
eternal
anguish
upon
this
catastrophe
to
lay
the
spirit
of
secret
upbraiding
by
which
she
was
incessantly
tormented
which
bereft
her
of
repose
empoisoned
all
her
enjoyments
and
menaced
not
only
the
subversion
of
her
peace
but
the
speedy
destruction
of
her
life
became
my
next
employment
my
counsels
and
remonstrances
were
not
wholly
inefficacious
they
afforded
me
the
prospect
of
her
ultimate
restoration
to
tranquillity
meanwhile
i
called
to
my
aid
the
influence
of
time
and
of
a
change
of
scene
i
hastened
to
embark
with
her
for
europe
our
voyage
was
tempestuous
and
dangerous
but
storms
and
perils
at
length
gave
way
to
security
and
repose
before
our
voyage
was
commenced
i
endeavoured
to
procure
tidings
of
the
true
condition
and
designs
of
ormond
my
information
extended
no
further
than
that
he
had
put
his
american
property
into
the
hands
of
melbourne
and
was
preparing
to
embark
for
france
courtland
who
has
since
been
at
paris
and
who
while
there
became
confidentially
acquainted
with
martinette
de
beauvais
has
communicated
facts
of
an
unexpected
nature
at
the
period
of
ormond
return
to
philadelphia
at
which
his
last
interview
with
constantia
in
that
city
took
place
he
visited
martinette
he
avowed
himself
to
be
her
brother
and
supported
his
pretensions
by
relating
the
incidents
of
his
early
life
a
separation
at
the
age
of
fifteen
and
which
had
lasted
for
the
same
number
of
years
may
be
supposed
to
have
considerably
changed
the
countenance
and
figure
she
had
formerly
known
his
relationship
was
chiefly
proved
by
the
enumeration
of
incidents
of
which
her
brother
only
could
be
apprized
he
possessed
a
minute
acquaintance
with
her
own
adventures
but
concealed
from
her
the
means
by
which
he
had
procured
the
knowledge
he
had
rarely
and
imperfectly
alluded
to
his
own
opinions
and
projects
and
had
maintained
an
invariable
silence
on
the
subject
of
his
connection
with
constantia
and
helena
being
informed
of
her
intention
to
return
to
france
he
readily
complied
with
her
request
to
accompany
her
in
this
voyage
his
intentions
in
this
respect
were
frustrated
by
the
dreadful
catastrophe
that
has
been
just
related
respecting
this
event
martinette
had
collected
only
vague
and
perplexing
information
courtland
though
able
to
remove
her
doubts
thought
proper
to
withhold
from
her
the
knowledge
he
possessed
since
her
arrival
in
england
the
life
of
my
friend
has
experienced
little
variation
of
her
personal
deportment
and
domestic
habits
you
have
been
a
witness
these
therefore
it
would
be
needless
for
me
to
exhibit
it
is
sufficient
to
have
related
events
which
the
recentness
of
your
intercourse
with
her
hindered
you
from
knowing
but
by
means
of
some
formal
narrative
like
the
present
she
and
her
friend
only
were
able
to
impart
to
you
the
knowledge
which
you
have
so
anxiously
sought
in
consideration
of
your
merits
and
of
your
attachment
to
my
friend
i
have
consented
to
devote
my
leisure
to
this
task
it
is
now
finished
and
i
have
only
to
add
my
wishes
that
the
perusal
of
this
tale
may
afford
you
as
much
instruction
as
the
contemplation
of
the
sufferings
and
vicissitudes
of
constantia
dudley
has
afforded
to
me
farewell
the
end
