preface
i
will
not
be
so
as
to
quote
the
names
of
all
the
writers
who
have
denied
the
existence
of
puritan
eccentricities
at
the
font
one
at
least
ought
to
have
known
better
for
he
has
edited
more
books
of
the
puritan
epoch
than
any
other
man
in
england
the
mistake
of
all
is
that
misled
perhaps
by
walter
scott
and
macaulay
they
have
looked
solely
to
the
commonwealth
period
the
custom
was
then
in
its
decay
i
have
to
thank
several
clergymen
for
giving
me
extracts
from
the
registers
and
records
under
their
care
a
stranger
to
them
i
felt
some
diffidence
in
making
my
requests
in
every
case
the
assistance
i
asked
for
was
readily
extended

the
gentleman
copied
no
less
than
names
all
of
puritan
origin
from
the
warbleton
records
i
beg
to
thank
him
most
warmly
and
to
congratulate
him
on
possessing
the
most
remarkable
register
of
its
kind
in
england
certain
circumstances
led
me
to
suspect
that
warbleton
was
a
kind
of
of
these
eccentricities
i
wrote
to
the
rector
and
we
soon
found
that
we
had
struck
ile
that
heley
the
puritan
incumbent
should
have
baptized
his
own
children
by
such
names
as
and
was
not
strange
but
that
he
should
have
persuaded
the
majority
of
his
parishioners
to
follow
his
example
proves
wonderful
personal
influence
amongst
the
laity
i
owe
gratitude
to
chaloner
smith
richmond
surrey
lloyd
albans
bailey
manchester
beardsley
cleveland
tarbutts
cranbrook
kent
and
mr
speed
ulverston
of
publications
i
must
needs
mention
and
a
to
all
antiquaries
the
sussex
archæological
works
and
the
archæological
and
topographical
the
wappentagium
de
strafford
of
the
latter
is
the
best
document
yet
published
for
students
of
nomenclature
out
of
it
alone
a
complete
history
of
english
surnames
and
baptismal
names
might
be
written
though
inscribed
with
clerkly
formality
it
contained
more
than
any
other
record
i
have
yet
seen
and
this
alone
must
stamp
it
as
a
most
important
document
the
harleian
society
by
publishing
church
registers
have
set
a
good
example
and
i
have
made
much
use
of
those
that
have
been
issued
they
contain
few
instances
of
puritan
extravagance
but
that
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
no
leading
puritan
was
minister
of
any
of
the
three
churches
whose
records
they
have
so
far
printed
i
sincerely
hope
the
list
of
subscribers
to
this
society
may
become
enlarged
for
the
rest
the
result
of
twelve
years
research
i
am
alone
responsible
heavy
clerical
responsibilities
have
often
been
lightened
by
a
holiday
spent
among
the
yellow
parchments
of
churches
in
town
and
country
from
north
to
south
of
england
as
it
is
possible
i
have
seen
as
many
registers
as
any
other
man
in
the
country
i
will
add
one
statement
a
very
serious
one
there
are
thousands
of
entries
at
this
moment
faintly
legible
which
in
another
generation
will
be
wholly
illegible
what
is
to
be
done
should
this
little
work
meet
the
eye
of
any
of
the
clergy
in
sussex
kent
and
i
may
add
surrey
i
would
like
to
state
that
if
they
will
search
the
baptismal
records
of
the
churches
under
their
charge
say
from
to
and
furnish
me
with
the
result
i
shall
be

of
the
i
the
paucity
of
names
after
the
conquest
there
were
no
scripture
names
in
england
when
the
conqueror
took
possession
even
in
normandy
they
had
appeared
but
a
generation
or
two
before
william
came
over
if
any
are
found
in
the
old
english
period
we
may
feel
assured
they
were
ecclesiastic
titles
adopted
at
ordination
greek
and
latin
saints
were
equally
unnoticed
it
is
hard
to
believe
the
statement
i
have
made
before
many
generations
had
passed
bartholomew
simon
peter
philip
thomas
nicholas
john
and
elias
had
engrossed
a
third
of
the
male
population
yet
domesday
book
has
no
philip
no
thomas
only
one
nicholas
and
but
a
sprinkling
of
johns
it
was
not
long
before
jack
and
jill
took
the
place
of
godric
and
godgivu
as
representative
of
the
english
sexes
yet
jack
was
from
the
bible
and
jill
from
the
saintly
calendar
without
entering
into
a
deep
discussion
we
may
say
that
the
great
mass
of
the
old
english
names
had
gone
down
before
the
year
had
been
reached
those
that
survived
only
held
on
for
bare
existence
from
the
moment
of
william
advent
the
names
of
the
norman
began
to
prevail
he
brought
in
bible
names
saint
names
and
his
own
teutonic
names
the
old
english
names
bowed
to
them
and
disappeared
a
curious
result
followed
from
the
year
to
four
hundred
years
in
round
numbers
there
was
a
very
much
smaller
dictionary
of
english
personal
names
than
there
had
been
for
four
hundred
years
before
and
than
there
has
been
in
the
four
hundred
years
since
the
norman
list
was
really
a
small
one
and
yet
it
took
possession
of
the
whole
of
england
a
consequence
of
this
was
the
epoch
in
every
community
of
one
hundred
englishmen
about
the
year
there
would
be
an
average
of
twenty
johns
and
fifteen
williams
then
would
follow
thomas
bartholomew
nicholas
philip
simon
peter
and
isaac
from
the
scriptures
and
richard
robert
walter
henry
guy
roger
and
baldwin
from
the
teutonic
list
of
female
names
matilda
isabella
and
emma
were
first
favourites
and
cecilia
catharine
margaret
and
gillian
came
closely
upon
their
heels
behind
these
again
followed
a
fairly
familiar
number
of
names
of
either
sex
some
from
the
teuton
some
from
the
hebrew
some
from
the
greek
and
latin
church
but
when
all
told
not
a
large
category
it
was
of
course
impossible
for
englishmen
and
englishwomen
to
maintain
their
individuality
on
these
terms
various
methods
to
secure
a
personality
arose
the
surname
was
adopted
and
there
were
john
john
the
wheelwright
john
the
bigg
and
john
richard
son
in
every
community
among
the
middle
and
lower
classes
these
did
not
become
till
so
late
as
or
this
was
not
enough
for
in
common
parlance
it
was
not
likely
the
full
name
would
be
used
besides
there
might
be
two
or
even
three
johns
in
the
same
family
so
late
as
march
the
will
of
john
parnell
de
gyrton
runs
alice
my
wife
and
old
john
my
son

occupy

the
register
of
raby
leicestershire
has
this
entry
item
day
of
august
was
john
and
john
picke
the
children
of
xtopher
and
anne
baptized
item
the
of
august
the
same
john
and
john
were
buried
burns
who
quotes
these
instances
in
his
history
of
parish
registers
adds
that
at
this
same
time
one
john
barker
had
three
sons
named
john
barker
and
two
daughters
named
margaret
barker
if
the
same
family
had
but
one
name
for
the
household
we
may
imagine
the
difficulty
when
this
one
name
was
also
popular
throughout
the
village
the
difficulty
was
naturally
solved
by
the
adoption
of
forms
the
addition
of
desinences
thus
emma
became
by
the
one
practice
simple
by
the
other
and
any
number
of
boys
in
a
small
community
might
be
entered
in
a
register
as
bartholomew
and
yet
preserve
their
individuality
in
life
by
bearing
such
names
as
bat
bate
batty
bartle
bartelot
batcock
batkin
and
tolly
or
tholy
in
a
word
these
several
forms
of
bartholomew
were
treated
as
so
many
separate
proper
names
no
one
would
think
of
describing
wat
tyler
we
should
now
say
walter
tyler
insurrection
as
gowen

it
will
be
seen
at
a
glance
that
such
appellatives
are
rare
by
comparison
in
the
present
day
tricks
of
this
kind
were
not
to
be
played
with
bible
names
at
the
reformation
and
the
new
names
from
that
time
were
pronounced
with
such
exceptions
as
will
be
detailed
hereafter
in
their
fulness
to
speak
of
william
and
john
is
to
speak
of
a
race
and
rivalry
years
old
in
domesday
there
were
williams
roberts
walters
to
johns
robert
montensis
asserts
that
in
at
a
court
feast
of
henry
sir
william
john
and
sir
william
bade
none
but
those
who
bore
the
name
of
william
to
appear
there
were
present
williams
all
knights
in
edward
i
reign
john
came
forward
in
a
wiltshire
document
containing
names
are
william
john
richard
robert
roger
geoffrey
ralph
and
peter
a
century
later
john
was
first
in
out
of
common
councilmen
for
london
first
convened
were
john
william
thomas
thomas
of
canterbury
was
now
an
institution
richard
henry
robert
in
the
guild
of
george
at
norwich
contained
names
of
these
john
engrossed
no
less
than
william
thomas
the
reformation
and
the
puritan
commonwealth
for
a
time
darkened
the
fortunes
of
john
and
william
but
the
protestant
accession
befriended
the
latter
and
now
as
years
ago
william
is
first
and
john
second
but
when
we
come
to
realize
that
nearly
of
englishmen
were
known
either
by
the
name
of
william
or
john
about
the
year
it
will
be
seen
that
the
and
were
no
freak
but
a
necessity
we
dare
not
attempt
a
category
but
the
surnames
of
tell
us
much
will
was
quite
a
distinct
youth
from
willot
willot
from
wilmot
wilmot
from
wilkin
and
wilkin
from
wilcock
there
might
be
half
a
dozen
johns
about
the
farmstead
but
it
mattered
little
so
long
as
one
was
called
jack
another
jenning
a
third
jenkin
a
fourth
jackcock
now
jacox
as
a
surname
a
fifth
brownjohn
and
a
sixth
micklejohn
or
littlejohn
or
properjohn
well
built
or
handsome
the
forms
are
still
familiar
in
many
instances
though
almost
entirely
confined
to
such
names
as
have
descended
from
that
day
to
the
present
we
still
talk
of
bob
and
tom
and
dick
and
jack
the
introduction
of
bible
names
at
the
reformation
did
them
much
harm
but
the
reformation
and
the
english
bible
combined
utterly
overwhelmed
the
desinences
and
they
succumbed
emmot
and
hamlet
lived
till
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
but
only
because
they
had
ceased
to
be
looked
upon
as
altered
forms
of
old
favourite
names
and
were
entered
in
vestry
books
on
their
own
account
as
orthodox
proper
names
ii
pet
forms
these
pet
desinences
were
of
four
kinds
the
primary
sense
of
seems
to
have
been
relationship
from
thence
family
or
offspring

phrases
from

from

however
and
our

in

memorial

implied
especially
the
pertness
of
lusty
and
swaggering
youth
to
cock
up

eye
or
the
hat
or
the
tail
a
haycock
in

a
in

wood
and
a

relationship

brisk
action
pert
demonstrativeness
the
cockerel
was
not
more
cockapert
than
the
boy
in
the
scullery
that
opened

the

where
both
strutted
hence
any
lusty
lad
was
cock
while
such
fuller
titles
as

him
a
preciser
individuality
the

proving

the
difficulty
of
identification
was
manifestly
lessened
in
a
village
or
town
where
could
be
distinguished
from
and
from
hence
again
the
common
occurrence
of
such
a
component
as
this
diminutive
is
never
seen
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
yet
we
have
many
evidences
of
its
use
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
the
english
bible
with
its
tendency
to
require
the
full
name
as
a
matter
of
reverence
while
it
supplied
new
names
in
the
place
of
the
old
ones
that
were
accustomed
to
the
desinence
caused
this
it
may
be
too
that
the
new
regulation
of
cromwell
in
requiring
the
careful
registration
of
all
baptized
children
caused
parents
to
lay
greater
stress
on
the
name
as
it
was
entered
in
the
any
way
the
sixteenth
century
saw
the
end
of
names
terminating
in
cock
or
a
dictionary

this
diminutive
to
judge
from
the
paris
directory
must
have
been
enormously
popular
with
our
neighbours
our
connection
with
normandy
and
france
generally
brought
the
fashion
to
the
english
court
and
in
habits
of
this
kind
the
english
folk
quickly
copied
their
superiors

were

as
popular

as
familiar
in

as
in

should
have
been
so
completely
uprooted
that
out
of
the
hundred
are
now
unaware
that
it
ever
existed
this
was
unmistakably
the
result
of
some
disturbing
element
of
english
social
life
at
the
commencement
of
the
sixteenth
century
there
was
no
appearance
of
this
confusion
in
france
the
practice
went
on
without
let
or
hindrance
we
can
again
but
attribute
it
to
the
reformation
and
the
english
bible
which
swept
away
a
large
batch
of
the
old
names
and
pronounced
the
new
without
addition
or
diminution
when
some
of
the
old
names
were
restored
it
was
too
late
to
fall
back
upon
the
familiarities
that
had
been
taken
with
them
in
the
earlier
period
in
spite
of
the
enormous
popularity
in

of
and
they
bear
no

on

there
was
not
a

in

of

popularity
that
had
not
attached

of

not

iii
scripture
names
already
in
use
at
the
reformation
it
now
remains
simply
to
consider
the
state
of
nomenclature
in
england
at
the
eve
of
the
reformation
in
relation
to
the
bible
classes
may
be
mentioned
the
leading
incidents
of
bible
narrative
were
familiarized
to
the
english
lower
orders
by
the
performance
of
sacred
plays
or
mysteries
rendered
under
the
supervision
of
the
church
to
these
plays
we
owe
the
early
popularity
of
adam
and
eve
noah
abraham
isaac
jacob
joseph
sara
daniel
sampson
susanna
judith
hanna
or
anna
and
hester
but
the
apocryphal
names
were
not
frequently
used
till
about
scarcely
any
diminutives
are
found
of
them
on
the
other
hand
adam
became
adcock
and
adkin
eve
evott
and

isaac
hickin
and
higgin
and
higgot
and
higget
joseph
joskin
and
daniel
dankin
and
dannet
the
crusaders
gave
us
several
prominent
names
to
them
we
are
indebted
for
and
and
received
a
great
stimulus
the
sacred
water
brought
in
the
leathern
bottle
was
used
for
baptismal
purposes
the

commemorated
john
the

the

the
forerunner
and
baptizer
of
jesus
christ
children
were
styled
by
these
incidents
became
popular
through
western
europe
in
england
he
gave
us
as
already
observed
judd
judkin
judson
jordan
and
jordanson
elias
as
ellis
took
about
the
eighth
place
of
frequency
and
john
for
a
while
the
first
saints
the
legends
of
the
saints
were
carefully
taught
by
the
priesthood
and
the
day
as
religiously
observed
all
children
born
on
these
holy
days
received
the
name
of
the
saint
commemorated
james

or

or
thomas
day
saw
a
small
batch
of
jameses
nicholases
and
thomases
received
into
the
fold
of
the
church
in
other
cases
the
gossip
had
some
favourite
saint
and
placed
the
child
under
his
or
her
protection
of
course
it
bore
the
patron
name
a
large
number
of
these
hagiological
names
were
such
as
cecilia
catharine
or
theobald
of
these
i
make
no
mention
here
all
the
apostles
save
judas
became
household
names
john
simon
peter
bartholomew
matthew
james
thomas
and
philip
being
the
favourites
paul
and
timothy
were
also
utilized
the
former
being
always
found
as
pol
if
a
child
was
born
at
whitsuntide
or
easter
christmas
or
epiphany
like
robinson
crusoe
man
friday
or
thursday
october
christian
of
the
pitcairn
islanders
he
received
the
name
of
the
day
hence
our
once
familiar
names
of
noel
or
nowell
pask
or
pascal
easter
pentecost
and
epiphany
or
tiffany
it
will
be
observed
that
all
these
imply
no
direct
or
personal
acquaintance
with
the
scriptures
all
came
through
the
church
all
too
were
in
the
full
tide
of
prosperity
with
the
single
exception
of
jordan
which
was
nearly
obsolete
when
the
bible
printed
into
english
and
set
up
in
our
churches
became
an
institution
the
immediate
result
was
that
the
old
scripture
names
of
bartholomew
peter
philip
and
nicholas
received
a
blow
much
deadlier
than
that
received
by
such
teutonic
names
as
robert
richard
roger
and
ralph
but
that
will
be
brought
out
as
we
progress
the
subject
of
the
influence
of
an
english
bible
upon
english
nomenclature
is
not
uninteresting
it
may
be
said
of
the
vulgar
tongue
bible
that
it
revolutionized
our
nomenclature
within
the
space
of
forty
years
or
little
over
a
generation
no
such
crisis
surely
ever
visited
a
register
before
nor
can
such
possibly
happen
again
every
home
felt
the
effect
it
was
like
the
massacre
of
the
innocents
in
egyptian
days
there
was
not
one
house
where
there
was
not
one
dead
but
in
pharoah
day
they
did
not
replace
the
dead
with
the
living
at
the
reformation
such
a
locust
army
of
new
names
burst
upon
the
land
that
we
may
well
style
it
the
hebrew
invasion
chapter
i
the
hebrew
invasion
with
what
face
can
they
object
to
the
king
the
bringing
in
of
forraigners

themselves
entertaine
such
an
army

with
our
faith
but
without
contempt
of
country
names
as
i
hope
which
have
both
good
and
gracious
significations
as
shall
appeare
hereafter
camden
i
march
of
the
the
strongest
impress
of
the
english
reformation
is
to
be
seen
in
our
the
majority
date
from
the
year
when
the
genevan
bible
was
published
this
version
ran
through
unnumbered
editions
and
for
sixty
if
not
seventy
years
was
the
household
bible
of
the
nation
the
genevan
bible
was
not
only
written
in
the
vulgar
tongue
but
was
printed
for
vulgar
hands
a
moderate
quarto
was
its
size
all
preceding
versions
such
as
coverdale
matthew
and
of
course
the
great
bible
being
the
ponderous
folio
specimens
of
which
the
reader
will
at
some
time
or
other
have
seen
the
genevan
bible
too
was
the
puritan
bible
and
was
none
the
less
admired
by
him
on
account
of
its
calvinistic
annotations
but
although
the
rage
for
bible
names
dates
from
the
decade
which
decade
marks
the
rise
of
puritanism
there
had
been
symptoms
of
the
coming
revolution
as
early
as
richard
hilles
one
of
the
reformers
despatching

zerrubabel
the
laureate
was
right
to
select
for
this
rebellious
protestant
a
name
that
was
to
be
popular
throughout
elizabeth
reign
but
poetic
license
runs
rather
far
in
giving
this
title
to
a
in
any
year
of
mary
rule
sanders
might
have
had
a
young
child
at
home
so
styled
but
for
himself
it
was
practically
impossible
so
clearly
defined
is
the
epoch
that
saw
if
not
one
batch
of
names
go
out
at
least
a
new
batch
come
in
equally
marked
are
the
names
from
the
bible
which
at
this
date
were
in
use
and
those
which
were
not
of
this
latter
category
zerrubabel
was
one
in
the
single
quotation
from
hilles
letter
of
we
see
the
origin
of
the
great
hebrew
invasion
explained
the
english
bible
had
become
a
fact
and
the
knowledge
of
its
personages
and
narratives
was
becoming
acquired
in
every
community
up
and
down
the
country
it
was
as
if
a
fresh
spring
of
clear
water
had
been
found
and
every
neighbour
could
come
with
jug
or
pail
and
fill
it
when
and
how
they
would
one
of
the
first
impressions
made
seems
to
have
been
this
children
in
the
olden
time
received
as
a
name
a
term
that
was
immediately
significant
of
the
circumstances
of
their
birth
often
god
personally
through
his
prophets
or
angelic
messenger
acted
as
godparent
indeed
and
gave
the
name
as
in
isaiah
viii
moreover
the
lord
said
unto
me
take
thee
a
great
roll
and
write
in
it
with
a
man
pen
concerning
and
i
went
unto
the
prophetess
and
she
conceived
and
bare
a
son
then
said
the
lord
to
me
call
his
name
for
before
the
child
shall
have
knowledge
to
cry
my
father
and
my
mother
the
riches
of
damascus
and
the
spoil
of
samaria
shall
be
taken
away
before
the
king
of
assyria
here
was
a
name
palpably
significant
even
before
they
knew
its
exact
meaning
the
name
was
enrolled
in
english
church
registers
and
zealot
puritans
employed
it
as
applicable
to
english
church
politics
all
the
patriarchs
down
to
the
twelve
sons
of
jacob
had
names
of
direct
significance
given
them
above
all
a
peculiar
emphasis
was
laid
upon
all
the
titles
of
jesus
christ
as
in
isaiah
vii
behold
a
virgin
shall
conceive
and
bear
a
son
and
shall
call
his
name
immanuel
at
the
same
time
that
this
new
revelation
came
a
crisis
was
going
on
of
religion
the
old
romish
church
was
being
uprooted
or
rather
a
new
system
was
being
grafted
upon
its
stock
for
the
links
have
never
been
broken
the
saints
were
shortly
to
be
tabooed
by
the
large
mass
of
english
folk
the
festivals
were
already
at
a
discount
simultaneously
with
the
prejudice
against
the
very
names
of
their
saints
and
saintly
festivals
arose
the
discovery
of
a
mine
of
new
names
as
novel
as
it
was
unexhaustible
they
not
merely
met
the
new
religious
instinct
but
supplied
what
would
have
been
a
very
serious
vacuum
but
we
must
at
once
draw
a
line
between
the
reformation
and
puritanism
previous
to
the
reformation
so
far
as
the
church
was
concerned
there
had
been
to
a
certain
extent
a
of
nomenclature
the
reformation
abrogated
that
system
but
did
not
intentionally
adopt
a
new
one
puritanism
deliberately
supplied
a
and
revised
scheme
beyond
which
no
adopted
child
of
god
must
dare
to
trespass
previous
to
the
reformation
the
priest
with
the
assent
of
the
gossip
gave
the
babe
the
name
of
the
saint
who
was
to
be
its
patron
or
on
whose
day
the
birth
or
baptism
occurred
if
the
saint
was
a
male
and
the
infant
a
female
the
difficulty
was
overcome
by
giving
the
name
a
feminine
form
thus
theobald
become
theobalda
and
hence
tib
and
tibot
became
so
common
among
girls
that
finally
they
ceased
to
represent
boys
at
all
if
it
were
one
of
the
great
holy
days
the
day
or
season
itself
furnished
the
name
thus
it
was
simon
or
nicholas
or
cecilia
or
austen
or
pentecost
or
ursula
or
dorothy
became
so
familiar
from
the
reign
of
elizabeth
the
clergy
and
englishmen
generally
gave
up
this
practice
saints
who
could
not
boast
apostolic
honours
were
rejected
and
holy
men
of
lesser
prestige
together
with
a
large
batch
of
virgins
and
martyrs
of
the
agnes
catharine
and
ursula
type
who
belonged
to
church
history
received
but
scant
attention
as
a
matter
of
course
their
names
lapsed
but
the
nation
stood
by
the
old
english
names
not
thus
popishly
tainted
against
geoffrey
richard
robert
and
william
they
had
no
prejudice
nay
they
clung
to
them
the
puritan
rejected
both
classes
he
was
ever
trotting
out
his
two
big
p
pagan
and
popish
under
the
first
he
placed
every
name
that
could
not
be
found
in
the
scriptures
and
under
the
latter
every
title
in
the
same
scriptures
and
the
church
system
founded
on
them
that
had
been
employed
previous
say
to
the
coronation
day
of
edward
vi
of
this
there
is
the
clearest
proof
in
a
directory
of
church
government
found
among
the
papers
of
cartwright
and
written
as
early
as
there
is
the
following
order
regarding
and
regulating
baptism
they
which
present
unto
baptism
ought
to
be
persuaded
not
to
give
those
that
are
baptized
the
names
of
god
or
of
christ
or
of
angels
or
of
holy
offices
as
of
baptist
evangelist
nor
such
as
savour
of
paganism
or
popery
but
chiefly
such
whereof
there
are
examples
in
the
holy
scriptures
in
the
names
of
those
who
are
reported
in
them
to
have
been
godly
and
virtuous
neale
vol
appendix
nothing
can
be
more
precise
than
this
to
the
strict
puritan
to
reject
the
richards
mileses
and
henrys
of
the
teutonic
and
the
bartholomews
simons
peters
and
nicholases
of
the
ecclesiastic
class
was
to
remove
the
canaanite
out
of
the

how
early
this
article
of
religion
was
obeyed
one

in
both
old
robert

and
the

must
have
been

of

the

careful
to

an
example

a
still
more
interesting
proof
comes
from
northampton
as
an
example
of
bigotry
it
is
truly
marvellous
on
july
archbishop
whitgift
furnished
the
lord
treasurer
with
the
following
amongst
many
articles
against
edmond
snape
curate
of
peter
in
that
town
item
christopher
hodgekinson
obteyned
a
promise
of
the
said
snape
that
he
would
baptize
his
child
but
snape
added
saying
must
then
give
it
a
christian
name
allowed
in
the
scriptures
then
hodgekinson
told
him
that
his
wife
father
whose
name
was
richard
desired
to
have
the
giving
of
that
name
at
the
time
of
service
snape
proceeded
till
they
came
to
the
place
of
naming
they
said
richard
but
hearing
them
calling
it
richard
and
that
they
would
not
give
it
any
other
name
he
stayed
there
and
would
not
in
any
case
baptize
the
child
and
so
it
was
carried
away
thence
and
was
baptized
the
week
following
at
allhallows
churche
and
called
richard
whitgift
ii
this
may
be
an
extreme
case
but
i
doubt
not
the
majority
of
the
presbyterian
clergy
did
their
best
to
uproot
the
old
english
names
so
far
as
their
power
of
persuasion
could
go
even
the
pulpit
was
used
in
behalf
of
the
new
doctrine
william
jenkin
the
afterwards
ejected
minister
in
his
expositions
of
jude
delivered
in
christ
church
london
said
while
commenting
on
the
first
verse
our
baptismal
names
ought
to
be
such
as
may
prove
remembrances
of
duty
he
then
instances
leah
alpheus
and
hannah
as
aware
of
parental
obligations
in
this
respect
and
adds
is
good
to
impose
such
names
as
expresse
our
baptismal
promise
a
good
name
is
as
a
thread
tyed
about
the
finger
to
make
us
mindful
of
the
errand
we
came
into
the
world
to
do
for
our
master
edition
as
a
general
rule
the
new
testament
names
spread
the
most
rapidly
especially
of
the
priscilla
dorcas
tabitha
and
martha
type
they
were
the
property
of
the
reformation
damaris

the
clerks
much
and
is
found
indifferently
as
tamaris

some
of
these
names
as
for
instance
priscilla

dorcas
and
phebe
stood
in
james
reign
almost
at
the
head
of
girls
names
in
england
indeed
alike
in
london
and
the
provinces
the
list
of
at
elizabeth
death
was
a
perfect
contrast
to
that
when
she
ascended
the
throne
then
the
great
national
names
of
isabella
matilda
emma
and
cecilia
ruled
supreme
then
the
four
heroines
anna
judith
susan
and
hester
one
or
two
of
whom
were
in
the
apocryphal
narrative
had
stamped
themselves
on
our
registers
in
what
appeared
indelible
lines
although
they
were
of
much
more
recent
popularity
than
the
others
they
lost
prestige
but
did
not
die
out
many
puritans
had
a
sneaking
fondness
for
them
finding
in
their
histories
a
parallel
to
their
own
troubles
and
perchance
they
had
a
private
and
more
godly
rendering
of
the
popular
ballad
of
their
day
in
ninivie
old
toby
dwelt
an
aged
man
and
blind
was
he
and
much
affliction
he
had
felt
which
brought
him
unto
poverty
he
had
by
anna
his
true
wife
one
only
sonne
and
eke
no
more
esther
is
still
popular
in
our
villages
so
is
susan
hannah
has
her
admirers
and
only
judith
may
be
said
to
be
forgotten
but
their
glory
was
from
to
after
that
they
became
secondary
personages
throughout
the
south
of
england
especially
in
the
counties
that
surrounded
london
the
bible
had
been
ransacked
from
nook
to
corner
the
zealots
early
dived
into
the
innermost
recesses
of
scripture
they
made
themselves
as
familiar
with
chapters
devoted
solely
to
genealogical
tables
as
to
those
which
they
quoted
to
defend
their
doctrinal
creed
the
eighth
chapter
of
romans
was
not
more
studied
by
them
than
the
of
genesis
and
the
dukes
of
edom
classified
in
the
one
were
laid
under
frequent
contribution
to
witness
to
the
adoption
treated
of
in
the
other
thus
names
unheard
of
in
were
household
words
in
the
slowest
to
take
up
the
new
custom
were
the
northern
counties
they
were
out
of
the
current
and
lancashire
besides
being
inaccessible
had
stuck
to
the
old
faith
names
lingered
on
in
the
palatinate
that
had
been
dead
nearly
a
hundred
years
in
the
south
gawin
figures
in
all
northern
registers
till
a
century
ago
and
thurston
was
yet
popular
in
the
fylde
district
when
it
had
become
forgotten
in
the
fens
scotland
was
never
touched
at
all
the
general
assembly
of
makes
no
hint
on
the
subject
although
it
dwelt
on
nearly
every
other
topic
nothing
demonstrates
the
clannish
feeling
of
north
britain
as
this
does
at
this
moment
scotland
has
scarcely
any
bible
names
in
yorkshire
however
puritanism
made
early
stand
though
its
effects
on
nomenclature
were
not
immediately
visible
it
was
like
the
fire
that
smoulders
among
the
underwood
before
it
catches
flame
it
spreads
the
more
rapidly
afterwards
the
genevan
bible
crept
into
the
dales
and
farmsteads
and
their
own
primitive
life
seemed
to
be
but
reflected
in
its
pages
the
patriarchs
lived
as
graziers
and
so
did
they
there
was
a
good
deal
about
sheep
and
kine
in
its
chapters
and
their
own
lives
were
spent
among
the
and
wool
shears
the
women
of
the
old
testament
baked
cakes
and
knew
what
good
butter
was
so
did
the
dales
folk
by
slow
degrees
cecilia
isabella
and
emma
lapsed
from
their
pedestal
and
the
little
babes
were
turned
into
sarahs
rebeccas
and
deborahs
as
the
seventeenth
century
progressed
the
state
of
things
became
still
more
changed
there
had
been
villages
in
sussex
and
kent
previous
to
elizabeth
death
where
the
presbyterian
rector
by
his
personal
influence
at
the
time
of
baptism
had
turned
the
new
generation
into
a
hebrew
colony
the
same
thing
occurred
in
yorkshire
only
half
a
century
later
as
nonconformity
gained
ground
guy
and
miles
and
peter
and
philip
became
forgotten
the
lads
were
no
sooner
ushered
into
existence
than
they
were
transformed
into
duplicates
of
joel
and
amos
and
obediah
the
measles
still
ran
through
the
family
but
it
was
phineas
and
caleb
not
robert
and
roger
that
underwent
the
infliction

leaders
of
israel
passed
through
the
critical
stages
of
teething
as
for
the
twelve
sons
of
jacob
they
could
all
have
answered
to
their
names
in
the
dames
schools
through
their
little
representatives
who
lined
the
rude
benches
on
the
village
green
every
prophet
from
isaiah
to
malachi
might
be
seen
of
an
evening
playing
unless
indeed
zephaniah
was
stealing
apples
in
the
garth
from
yorkshire
about
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
rage
for
scripture
names
passed
into
lancashire
nonconformity
was
making
progress
the
new
industries
were
already
turning
villages
into
small
centres
of
population
and
the
church
of
england
not
providing
for
the
increase
chapels
were
built
if
we
look
over
the
pages
of
the
directories
of
west
yorkshire
and
east
lancashire
and
strike
out
the
surnames
we
could
imagine
we
were
consulting
anciently
inscribed
registers
of
joppa
or
jericho
it
would
seem
as
if
canaan

the
west

had
got
inextricably
mixed

a
spectacle
meets
our
eye
within

only
the

much
against
his

another
parson
on
the
derbyshire
border
was
gravely
informed
at
the
proper
moment
that
the
name
of
baptism
was
boy
or
girl
eh
he
asked
in
a
somewhat
agitated
voice
the
parents
had
opened
the
bible
according
to
the
village
tradition
and
selected
the
first
name
the
eye
fell
on
it
was
but
a
year
ago
a
little
child
was
christened
tellno
in
a
town
within
six
miles
of
manchester
at
the
suggestion
of
a
the
father
a
workman
of
the
name
of
lees
having
asked
his
advice
i
suppose
it
must
be
a
scripture
name
said
his
master
oh
yes
that
of
course
suppose
you
choose
said
his
employer
that
do
replied
the
other
who
had
never
heard
it
before
and
liked
it
the
better
on
that
account
the
child
is
now
lees
the
father
too
late
finding
that
he
had
been
hoaxed
was
the
answer
given
to
a
bewildered
curate
after
the
usual
demand
to
name
the
child
he
objected
but
was
informed
that
it
was
a
scripture
name
and
the
verse
sirs
what
must
i
do
to
be
saved
was
triumphantly
appealed
to
this
reminds
one
of
the
puritan
who
styled
his
dog
after
the
dog
in
the
gospel
the
dog
came
and
licked
his
sores
there
is
again
a
story
of
a
clergyman
making
the
customary
demand
as
to
name
from
a
knot
of
women
round
the
font
ax
her
said
one
turning
to
the
woman
who
appeared
to
be
indicated
he
again
asked
what
name
ax
her
she
replied
the
third
woman
being
questioned
gave
the
same
reply
at
last
he
discovered
the
name
to
be
the
scriptural
achsah
daughter
a
name
by
the
way
which
was
somewhat
popular
with
our
forefathers
no
wonder
this
mistake
arose
when
achsah
used
to
be
entered
in
some
such
manner
as
this
baptized
axar
starrs
a
woman
of
ripe
years
of
stockport
married
warren
davenport
of
stockport
and
axar
starrs
aforesaid
spinster
marple
cheshire
axar
father
was
caleb
starrs
the
scriptural
relationship
was
thus
preserved
achsah
crossed
the
atlantic
with
the
pilgrim
fathers
and
has
prospered
there
ever
since
it
is
still
popular
in
devonshire
and
the
of
england
all
these
stories
serve
to
show
the
quarry
whence
modern
names
are
hewn
i
have
mentioned
the
north
because
i
have
studied
its
directories
carefully
but
if
any
one
will
visit
the
shires
of
dorset
and
devon
and
hampshire
he
will
find
the
same
result
the
hebrew
has
won
the
day
just
as
in
england
north
of
trent
we
can
still
measure
off
the
ravages
of
the
dane
by
striking
a
line
through
all
local
names
lying
westward
ending
in
by
so
we
have
but
to
count
up
the
baptismal
names
of
the
peasantry
of
these
southern
counties

see
that
they
have
become
the

popularity
of

affection
felt
by
the
puritans
for
the
old
testament
has
been
observed
by
all
writers
upon
the
period
and
of
the
period

cromwell

you
may
learne
the
genealogy
of

saviour
by
the
names
in
his
regiment
the
uses
no
other
list
than
the
first
chapter
of
matthew
lord
macaulay
puts
it
much
more
faithfully
in
his
first
chapter
speaking
too
of
an
earlier
period
than
the
commonwealth
in
such
a
history
old
testament
it
was
not
difficult
for
fierce
and
gloomy
spirits
to
find
much
that
might
be
distorted
to
suit
their
wishes
the
extreme
puritans
therefore
began
to
feel
for
the
old
testament
a
preference
which
perhaps
they
did
not
distinctly
avow
even
to
themselves
but
which
showed
itself
in
all
their
sentiments
and
habits
they
paid
to
the
hebrew
language
a
respect
which
they
refused
to
that
tongue
in
which
the
discourses
of
jesus
and
the
epistles
of
paul
have
come
down
to
us
they
baptized
their
children
by
the
names
not
of
christian
saints
but
of
hebrew
patriarchs
and
warriors
the
presbyterian
clergy
had
another
objection
to
the
new
testament
names
the
possessors
were
all
saints
and
in
the
saints
calendar
the
apostolic
title
was
as
a
red
rag
to
his
eye
upon
saint
peter
paul
john
jude
and
james
they
will
not
put
the
unto
their
names
says
the
in
execrable
verse
its
use
was
still
more
trying
as
no
man
could
pass
through
a
single
quarter
of
london
without
seeing
half
a
dozen
churches
or
lanes
or
taverns
dedicated
to
saint
somebody
or
other
others
to
make
all
things
recant
the
christian
and
surname
of
saint
would
force
all
churches
streets
and
towns
the
holy
title
to
renounce
to
avoid
any
saintly
taint
the
puritan
avoided
the
saints
themselves
but
the
discontented
party
in
the
church
had
as
macaulay
says
a
decided
hankering
after
the
old
testament
on
other
grounds
than
this
they
paid
the
hebrew
language
an
almost
superstitious
reverence

indeed

scarcely
survived

it

few
scripture
names
made
themselves
so
popular
as
this
at
the
conclusion
of
the
sixteenth
century
it
was
beginning
its
career
and
by
queen
day
had
reached
its
zenith
when
the
cavalier
was
drinking
at
the
alehouse
he
would
waggishly
chant
through
his
nose
with
eye
upturned
come
sisters
and
sing
an
hymne
to
our
king
who
sitteth
on
high
degree
the
men
at
whitehall
and
the
wicked
shall
fall
and
hey
then
up
go
we
match
quoth
my
sister
joice
quoth
rachel
too
quoth
abigaile
and
faith
and
charity
it
be
so
a
curious
error
has
been
propagated
by
writers
who
ought
to
have
known
better
it
is
customarily
asserted
that
abigail
as
a
cant
term
for
a
only
arose
after
abigail
hill
the
duchess
of
cousin
became
to
the
queen
and
supplanted
her
kinswoman
certainly
we
find
both
swift
and
fielding
using
the
term
after
this
event
but
there
is
good
reason
for
believing
that
the
sobriquet
is
as
old
as
charles
i
reign
indeed
there
can
be
no
reasonable
doubt
but
that
we
owe
the
term
to
the
enormous
popularity
of
beaumont
comedy
the
scornful
ladie
written
about
and
played
in
the
chief
part
falls
to
the
lot
of
abigal
a
as
the
styles
her
the
playwright
associating
the
name
and
employment
after
the
scriptural
narrative
but
beaumont
knew
his
bible
well
that
abigail
at
once
became
a
cant
term
is
proved
by
the
wedding
written
by
killigrew
some
time
between
and
wanton
addresses
the
parson
was
she
deaf
to
your
report
yes
yes
and
ugly
her
abigail
she
had
her
say
too
yes
yes
that
this
sentence
would
never
have
been
written
but
for
beaumont
play
there
can
be
no
reasonable
doubt
it
was
performed
so
late
as
in
after
yearly
performances
it
was
published
as
a
droll
and
entitled
the
false
heir
in
it
appears
again
under
the
title
of
the
feigned
shipwreck
samuel
pepys
in
his
diary
records
his
visits
to
the
playhouse
to
see
the
scornful
lady
at
least
four
times
viz
and
writing
december
he
says
by
coach
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
scornful
well
acted
doll
common
doing
abigail
most
excellently
abigail
passed
out
of
favour
about
the
middle
of
the
last
century
but
masham
artifices
had
little
to
do
with
it
the
comedy
had
done
its
work
and
abigail
coming
into
use
like
malkin
two
centuries
before
as
the
cant
term
for
a
kitchen
drab
or
common
serving
wench
as
is
sufficiently
proved
by
the
literature
of
the
day
the
name
lost
caste
with
all
classes
and
was
compelled
to
bid
adieu
to
public
favour
this
affection
for
the
old
testament
has
never
died
out
among
the
nonconformists
the
large
batch
of
names
i
have
already
quoted
from
modern

is
almost
wholly
from
the
earlier
testament
wherever
dissent
is
strong
there
will
be
found
a
large
proportion
of
these
names
amongst
the
passengers
who
went
out
to

in

something
so
emphatic
about

barrabas
was
a

that
thoughts
of
theft
seem
proper
to
the
very
name
we
should
have
locked
up
the
spoons
we
feel
sure
had
father
or
son
called
upon
us
the
father
who
called
his
son
scarcely
cleared
the
name
of
its
evil
associations
nor
would
it
quite
meet
the
difficulty
suggested
by
the
remark
in
tristram
shandy
your
billy
sir
would
you
for
the
world
have
called
him
judas
would
you
sir
if
a
jew
of
a
godfather
had
proposed
the
name
of
your
child
and
offered
you
his
purse
along
with
it
would
you
have
consented
to
such
a
desecration
of
him
we
have
all
heard
the
story
of
beelzebub
if
the
child
had
been
inadvertently
so
baptized
a
remedy
might
have
been
found
in
former
days
by
changing
the
name
at
confirmation
until
the
bishop
confirmed
by
name
archbishop
peccham
laid
down
a
rule
the
minister
shall
take
care
not
to
permit
wanton
names
which
being
pronounced
do
sound
to
lasciviousness
to
be
given
to
children
baptized
especially
of
the
female
sex
and
if
otherwise
it
be
done
the
same
shall
be
changed
by
the
bishop
at
confirmation
that
this
law
had
been
carelessly
followed
after
the
reformation
is
clear
else
venus
levat
already
quoted
would
not
have
been
married
in
under
that
name
certainly
dinah
and
tamar
come
under
the
ban
of
this
injunction
curiously
enough
the
change
of
name
was
sanctioned
in
the
case
of
orthodox
names
for
lord
coke
says
if
a
man
be
baptized
by
the
name
of
thomas
and
after
at
his
confirmation
by
the
bishop
he
is
named
john
his
name
of
confirmation
shall
stand
he
then
quotes
the
case
of
sir
francis
gawdie
chief
justice
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
whose
name
by
baptism
was
thomas
thomas
being
changed
to
francis
at
confirmation
he
holds
that
francis
shall
stand
institutes
this
practice
manifestly
arose
out
of
peccham
rule
but
it
is
strange
that
wanton
instances
should
be
left
unchanged
and
the
orthodox
allowed
to
be
altered
arising
out
of
the
puritan
error
of
permitting
names
like
tamar
and
dinah
to
stand
modern
eccentricity
has
gone
very
far
and
it
would
be
satisfactory
to
see
many
names
in
use
at
present
forbidden
i
need
not
quote
the
venuses
of
our
directories
emanuel
is
of
an
opposite
character
and
should
be
considered
blasphemy
we
have
not
adopted
christ
yet
as
doran
reminded
us
they
have
done
in
germany
but
my
copy
of
the
london
directory
shows
at
least
one
german
bearing
the
baptismal
name
of
christ
at
present
dwelling
in
the
metropolis
puritan
eccentricity
is
a
trifle
to
this
iv
losses
destruction
of
pet
but
let
us
now
notice
some
of
the
more
disastrous
effects
of
the
great
hebrew
invasion
the
most
important
were
the
partial
destruction
of
the
nick
forms
and
the
suppression
of
diminutives
the
english
pet
names
disappeared
never
more
to
return
desinences
in
cock
kin
elot
ot
et
in
and
on
are
no
more
found
in
current
literature
nor
in
the
clerk
register
why
should
this
be
so
an
important
reason
strikes
us
at
once
the
ecclesiastic
names
on
which
the
enclytics
had
grown
had
become
unpopular
throughout
england
it
was
an
english
not
a
puritan
prejudice
with
the
suppression
of
the
names
proper
went
the
desinences
attached
to
them
the
tree
being
felled
the
parasite
decayed
another
reason
was
this
the
names
introduced
from
the
scriptures
did
not
seem
to
compound
comfortably
with
these
terminatives
the
hebrew
name
would
first
have
to
be
turned
into
a
nick
form
before
the
diminutive
was
appended
the
english
peasantry
had
added
and
only
to
the
never
to
the
baptismal
form
it
was
not
walterkin
not
bartholomewkin
wilcock
not
williamcock
colin
not
philpot
not
philipot
but
the
popular
feeling
for
a
century
was
against
turning
the
new
scripture
names
into
curt
nick
forms
as
it
would
have
been
an
absurdity
to
have
appended
diminutives
to
sesquipedalian
names
national
wit
rather
than
deliberate
plan
prevented
it
if
it
was
irreverent
too
to
curtail
scripture
names
it
was
equally
irreverent
to
give
them
the
diminutive
dress
to
prove
the
absolute
truth
of
my
statement
i
have
only
to
remind
the
reader
that
saving
not
one
single
bible
name
introduced
by
the
reformation
and
the
english
bible
has
become
conjoined
with
a
diminutive
the
immediate
consequence
was
this
the
diminutive
forms
became
obsolete

may
add
that
some

a
critic
of
my
book
on

in

rebuked
me
for
supposing
that
emmot
could
be
from

and
calmly
put
it
down
as
a
form
of
aymot
what
can
prove
the
effect
of
the
reformation
on
old
english
names
as
do
such
incidents
as
these

english

styled

was
sufficiently
familiar

when
an
antiquary

found
this
same
gaveston
described
as
perot
it
became
a
difficulty
to
not
a
few
the
perrots
or
parratts
of
our
london
directory
might
have
told

any

twenty

before

these
were
not
merely
the
familiar
pet

of
matilda
emma

isabella
but
that
as
a
trio
they
stood
absolutely
first
in

they
comprised
more

of

the

is
in

knoweth

no

what
a
remarkable
revolution
is
this
and
so
speedy
failing
our
registers
the
question
may
arise
whether
or
not
in
familiar
converse
the
old
pet
forms
were
still
used
our
ballads
and
plays
preserve
many
of
the
nick
forms
but
scarcely
a
pet

is
to
be
seen
later
than

here
may
be
said
to
end
this
homely
and
contemporary
class
of
is
true
in
beaumont
and
fletcher
beggar
bush
higgen
is
one
of
the
three
knavish
beggars
but
the
scene
is
laid
in
flanders
judging
by
our
songs
and
comedies
the
diminutive
forms
went
down
with
terrible
rapidity
and
were
practically
obsolete
before
elizabeth
death
but
this
result
was
more
the
work
of
the
reformation
at
large
than
puritanism
decrease
of
nick
this
was
not
all
the
nick
forms
saw
themselves
reduced
to
straits
the
new
godly
names
i
have
said
were
not
to
be
turned
into
irreverent
cant
terms
from
the
earliest
day
of
the
reformation
every
man
who
gave
his
child
a
bible
name
stuck
to
it
unaltered
ebenezer
at
baptism
was
ebenezer
among
the
turnips
ebenezer
with
the
and
ebenezer
in
courtship
while
deborah
who
did
not
become
deb
till
charles
i
reign
would
ebenezer
him
till
the
last
day
she
had
done
scolding
him
and
put
ebenezer
carefully
on
his
grave
to
prove
how
happily
they
had
lived
together
as
for
the
zealot
who
gradually
forged
his
way
to
the
front
he
gave
his
brother
and
sister
in
the
lord
the
full
benefit
of
his
or
her
title
whether
it
was
five
syllables
or
seven
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
these
hebrew
names
did
not
readily
adapt
themselves
to
ordinary
converse
with
the
world
melchisedek
and
ebedmelech
were
all
right
elbowing
their
way
into
the
conventicle
but
melchisedek
dispensing
of
butter
over
the
counter
or
ebedmelech
carrying
from
door
to
door
gave
people
a
kind
of
shock
these
grand
assumptions
suggested
knavery
one
feels
certain
that
our
had
a
suspicion
of
tallow
in
the
butter
and
jupiter
pluvius
in
the
pail
nor
did
these
excavated
names
harmonize
with
the
surnames
to
which
they
were
yoked
adoniram
was
quaint
enough
without
byfield
but
both
as
butler
in
hudibras
knew
suggested
something
slightly
ludicrous
byron
took
a
mean
advantage
of
this
when
he
attacked
poor
cottle
the
bookseller
and
writer
o
amos
cottle
phoebus
what
a
name
to
fill
the
speaking
trump
of
future
fame
o
amos
cottle
for
a
moment
think
what
meagre
profits
spring
from
pen
and
ink
amos
is
odd
but
amos
united
to
cottle
makes
a
smile
irresistible
who
does
not
agree
with
wilkes
who
when
speaking
to
johnson
of
rival
the
city
poet
says
elkanah
settle
sounds
so
queer
who
can
expect
much
from
that
name
we
should
have
no
hesitation
to
give
it
for
john
dryden
in
preference
to
elkanah
settle
from
the
names
only
without
knowing
their
different
merits
and
sterne
as
the
elder
disraeli
reminds
us
in
one
of
his
multitudinous
digressions
from
the
life
of
tristram
shandy
makes
the
progenitor
of
that
young
gentleman
turn
absolutely
melancholy
as
he
conjures
up
a
vision
of
all
the
men
who
might
have
done
exceeding
well
in
the
world
had
not
their
characters
and
spirits
been
totally
depressed
and
nicodemas
into
nothing
even
oliver
goldsmith
can
not
resist
styling
the
knavish
seller
of
green
spectacles
by
a
conjunction
of
hebrew
and
english
titles
as
ephraim
jenkinson
and
his
servant
who
acts
the
part
of
a
job
trotter
another
old
testament
worthy
again
to
his
master
is
of
course
abraham
but
oddly
as
such
combinations
strike
upon
the
modern
tympanum
what
must
not
the
effect
have
been
in
a
day
when
a
nickname
was
popular
according
as
it
was
curt
how
would
men
rub
their
eyes
in
sheer
amazement
when
such
conjunctions
as
ebedmelech
gastrell
or
epaphroditus
haughton
or
onesiphorus
dixey
were
introduced
to
their
notice
pronounced
with
all
sesquipedalian
fulness
following
upon
the
very
heels
of
a
long
epoch
of
traditional
ralphs
hodges
hicks
wats
phips
bates
and
balls
baldwin
conceive
the
amazement
at
such

as

the

already
enumerated
a
list
of
pilgrim
fathers
of
james
reign
whose
baptisms
would
be
recorded
in
the
previous

but
compare
this
with
the
fact
that
the
leading
men
in
england
at
this
very
time
were
recognized
only
by
the
curtest
of
abbreviated
names
in
that
very
quaint

that

so
bluntly

yes
to

we
need
not

therefore
that

the

how
the

would
laugh
and
cheer
at
a
sally
that
was
simply
manufactured
of
a
repetition
of
the
good
name
for
humphrey
and
thus
a
passage
that
reads
as
very
dull
fun
indeed
to
the
ears
of
the
nineteenth
century
would
seem
to
be
brimful
of
sarcastic
allusion
to
the
popular
audience
of
the
seventeenth
especially
when
spoken
by
such
lips
as
wintersels
the
same
effect
was
attempted
and
attained
in
the

addresses
the
deacon

hither
to
make
atonement
for
you
quickly
and
give

satisfaction

out
goes

point

will
say
abel

an
old
testament
name
should
neither
have
been
given
to
an
character
nor
ought
it
to
have
been
turned
into
a
nickname
this
would
never
have
occurred
to
the
audience
abel
or
nab
had
been
one
of
the
most
popular
of
english
names
for
at
least
three
centuries
before
the
reformation
hence
it
was
used
by
the
puritans
and
was
as
a
matter
of
course
the
undisturbed
property
of
their
enemies
three
centuries
of
bad
company
had
ruined
nab
morals
the
zealot
would
none
of
it
but
from
all
this
it
will
be
seen
that
a
much
better
fight
was
made
in
behalf
of
the
old
nick
forms
than
of
the
diminutives
by
a
timely
rally
tom
jack
dick
and
harry
were
carried
against
all
hindrances
into
the
restoration
period
and
from
that
time
they
were
safe
wat
phip
hodge
bat

lost
their
position
but
so
had
the
fuller
philip
roger
bartholomew

the
opponents
of
puritanism
carried
the
war
into
the
enemy
camp
in
revenge
for
this
and
priscilla
deborah
jeremiah
and
nathaniel
although
they
were
rather
of
the
reformation
than
puritanic
introductions
were
turned
by
the

of

after

this
too
was
a
failure
indeed
it
demonstrates
a
remarkable
reverence
for
their
bible
on
the
part
of
the
english
race
that
every
attempt
to
turn
one
of
its
names
into
a
nick
form
saving
in
some
three
or
four
instances
has
ignominiously
failed
we
mean
of
course
since
the
reformation
the
restoration
was
a
great
restoration
of
nick
forms
such
names
as
had
survived
were
again
for
a
while
in
full
favour
and
the
reader
has
only
to
turn
to
the
often
coarse
ballads
and
songs
contained
in
such
collections
as
tom
pills
to
purge
melancholy
to
see
how
nan
sis
sib
kate
and
doll
had
been
brought
back
to
popular
favour
it
was
but
a
spurt
however
in
the
main
as
the
lascivious
reaction
from
the
puritanic
in
some
degree
spent
itself
so
did
the
newly
restored
fashion
and
when
the
eighteenth
century
brought
in
a
fresh
innovation
viz
the
forms
such
as
beatrix
maria
lætitia
carolina
louisa
amelia
georgina
dorothea
prudentia
honora
an
innovation
that
for
forty
years
ran
like
an
epidemic
through
every
class
of
society
and
was
sarcastically
alluded
to
by
goldsmith
in
miss
carolina
wilhelmina
amelia
skeggs
and
the
sisters
olivia
and
sophia
the
old
nick
forms
once
more
bade
adieu
to
english
society
and
now
enjoy
but
a
partial
favour
but
bill
tom

still
hold
on
like
grim
death
long
may
they
continue
to
do

were
some
serious
losses

again
the
reformation
apart
from
puritanism
had
much
to
do
with
the
decay
of
these
names
last
of
some
old
there
were
some
old
english
favourites
that
the
reformation
and
the
english
bible
did
not
immediately
crush
thousands
of
men
were
youths
when
the
hebrew
invasion
set
in
and
lived
unto
james
reign
their
names
crop
up
of
course
in
the
burial
registers
others
were
inclined
to
be
tenacious
over
family
favourites
we
must
be
content
in
the
records
of
elizabeth
and
even
james
reign
to
find
some
old
friends
standing
side
by
side
with
the
new
the
majority
of
them
were
and
therefore
did
not
meet
with
the
same
opposition
as
those
that
savoured
of
the
old
ecclesiasticism
nevertheless
this
new
fashion
was
telling
on
them
and
of
most
we
may
say
their
places
know
them
no
more
looking
from
now
back
to
then
we
see
this
the
more
clearly
we
turn
to
the
calendar
of
state
papers
and
we
find
a
grant
dated
november
to
reade
to
travel
four
years
shortly
afterwards

we
come
across
a

to

of

of
the

of

of

of

casting
our
eye
backwards
we
speedily
reach
a
grant
or
warrant
in
wherein
harvey
is
mentioned
in
comes
fyser
one
after
another
these
names
occur
within
the
space
of
five
years
names
then
although
it
was
well
in
james

known
of
all
men

borne
reputably
by
many
but
who
will
say
that

are
alive
now
how
they
were
to
be
elbowed
out

the

about
to
be
made
take
another
specimen
a
few
years
earlier
in
the
chancery

at
the
close
of

we
find
a

named

a

bearing
the

such
other

as

hatfield
within
a

limit
we

these

avery

ellice
morrice
gervase
and

were
on
everybody
lips
when
henry

was

who
can
say
that
they
exist
now
only
maurice
and
gervase
enjoy
a
precarious

a
breath

disregard
would
blow

in

avery

what
else
do
we

in

we

bearing
such

as
esaye

isaiah

audly
eliezer
or
seth
awcocke
or
urias
babington
or

brent
and
this
not
forty
years
after
the
reformation
these
men
must
have
been
baptized
in
the
very
throes
of
the
great

another

the

alongside

here
once
more
we
are
reminded
of
two
pretty

that
have
gone
the
way
of
the
others
it
makes
one
quite
sad
to
think
of
these
national
losses
amice
previous
to
the

was
a
household
favourite
and
colet
a
perfect

wo
somebody
come
to

rescue
why
on
earth
should
the
fact
that
the

has
been
translated
out
of

into

strip
us
of
these
treasures
turn
once

the

but
what
a
state
of
confusion
does
all
this
reveal
by
the
time
of
the
commonwealth
there
was
the
choice
of
three
methods
of
selection
open
to
the
english
householder
in
this
matter
of
names
he
might
copy
the
zealot
faction
and
select
his
names
from
the
scriptures
or
the
category
of
christian
graces
he
might
rally
by
the
old
english
gentleman
who
at
this
time
was
generally
a
cavalier
and
dick
tom
harry
or
dolly
his
children
or
he
might
be
careless
about
the
whole
matter
and
mix
the
two
according
to
his
caprice
or
fancy
that
royalist
had
no
bad
conception
of
the
state
of
society
in
when
he
turned
off
verses
such
as
these

no
imaginary

coined
to

the
exigencies
of
rhyme
thanks
however
to
the
good
sense
of
the
nation
an
effort
was
made
in

of
such
old
favourites
as
john

richard

so
early

he

who
though
they
bore
names
not

familiar

the
country
were
as

as
any

upon

running
through
a

of
all

the

practically
ended
the
conflict
but
it
was
a
truce
for
both
sides
so
far
as
nomenclature
is
concerned
retained
trophies
of
victory
and
on
the
whole
the
hebrew
was
the
gainer
at
the
start
he
had
little
to
lose
and
he
has
filled
the
land
with
titles
that
had
lain
in
abeyance
for
four
thousand
years
the
old
english
yeoman
has
lost
many
of
his
most
honoured
cognomens
but
he
can
still
at
least
boast
one
thing
the
two
names
that
were
foremost
before
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
century
stand
at
this
moment
in
the
same
position
out
of
every
hundred
children
baptized
in
england
thirteen
are
entered
in
the
register
as
john
or
william
the
cavalier
too
can
boast
that
charles
although
there
were
not
more
of
that
name
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
england
at
the
beginning
of
elizabeth
reign
than
could
be
counted
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
now
occupies
the
sixth
place
among
male
baptismal
names
several
names
now
predominant
were
for
various
reasons
lifted
above
the
contest
george
holds
the
fourth
position
among
boys
mary
and
elizabeth
the
first
and
second
among
girls
george
dates
all
his
popularity
from
the
last
century
and
mary
was
in
danger
of
becoming
obsolete
at
the
close
of
elizabeth
reign
so
hateful
had
it
become
to
englishmen
whether
churchmen
or
presbyterians
it
was
at
this
time
philip
too
lost
a
place
it
can
never
recover
but
the
fates
came
to
the
rescue
of
mary
when
the
prince
of
orange
landed
at
torbay
and
sate
with
james
daughter
on
england
throne
it
has
been
first
favourite
ever
since
as
for
elizabeth
a
chapter
might
be
written
upon
it
just
known
and
no
more
at
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
it
was
speedily
popularized
in
the
daughter
of
the
reformation
the
puritans
in
spite
of
persecution
and
other
provocations
were
ever
true
to
good
queen
bess
the
name
too
was
scriptural
and
had
not
been
mixed
up
with
centuries
of
romish
superstition
elizabeth
ruled
supreme
and
was
contorted
and
twisted
into
every
conceivable
shape
that
ingenuity
could
devise
it
narrowly
escaped
the
diminutive
desinence
for
ezot
and
ezota
occur
to
my
knowledge
four
times
in
records
between
and
but
bess
and
bessie
took
up
the
running
and
a
century
later
bett
and
betty
it
will
surprise
almost
all
my
readers
i
suspect
to
know
that
the
lady
bettys
of
the
early
part
of
last
century
were
never
or
rarely
ever
christened
elizabeth
queen
anne
reign
even
william
and
mary

saw
the
fashionable
rage

latinized

was

it

the

that

become
the

of
the
lower

had
soon
learnt
to
copy
their

the

fell
back

more

other
freaks

a
turn

after

the

before

popular
in

much
resorted
to
in

and
is
still
familiar
in
the
nineteenth
century
thomas

the

and
george
says
augustus
still
survives
in
maro
strain
and
spenser
verse
prolongs
eliza
reign
but
by
the
lexicographer
day
the
poorer
classes
had
ceased
to
recognize
that
eliza
and
betty
were
parts
of
one
single
name
they
took
up
each
on
her
own
account
as
a
separate
name
and
thus
betty
and
eliza
were
commonly
met
with
in
the
same
household
this
is
still
frequently
seen

of

elizabeth

with

of

population
looking
lower
down
we
find
eliza
ranked
in
the
place
with
this
is
scarcely
fair
the
two
ought
to
be
added
together
at

it
perpetuates
a
misconception

as

like
which
have
been
rather
descriptions
than
names
thomas
adams
upon
the
in
giving
names
to
children
it
was
their
opinion
that
should
be
avoided
as
not
so
fit
for
christians
and
also
the
names
of

and

and

there
are
still
many
people
who
are
sceptical
about
the
stories
told
against
the
puritans
in
the
matter
of
of
these
some
are
nonconformists
who
do
not
like
the
slights
thus
cast
upon
their
spiritual
ancestry
unaware
that
while
this
curious
phase
was
at
its
climax
puritanism
was
yet
within
the
pale
of
the
church
of
england
others
having
searched
through
the
lists
of
the
protector
parliaments
commissioners
and
army
officers
and
having
found
but
a
handful
of
odd
baptismal
names
declare
without
hesitation
that
these
stories
are
wicked
calumnies
peacock
whose
book
on
the
army
lists
of
roundheads
and
cavaliers
is
well
worth
study
says
in
one
of
the
numbers
of
and
i
know
modern
writers
have
repeated
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
but
i
do
not
remember
any
trustworthy
evidence
of
the
commonwealth
time
or
that
of
charles
that
would
lead
us
to
believe
that
strange
christian
names
were
more
common
in
those
days
than
now
what
passages
have
we
on
this
subject
in
the
works
of
the
restoration
playwrights
this
is
an
old
mistake
if
peacock
had
looked
at
our
registers
from
to
instead
of
from
to
he
would
never
have
written
the
above
there
is
the
most
distinct
evidence
that
during
the
latter
portion
of
elizabeth
reign
the
whole
of
james
reign
and
great
part
of
charles
reign
in
a
district
roughly
comprising
england
south
of
the
trent
and
having
say
banbury
for
its
centre
there
prevailed
amongst
a
certain
class
of
english
religionists
a
practice
of
baptizing
children
by
scriptural
phrases
pious
ejaculations
or
godly
admonitions
it
was
a
practice
instituted
of
deliberate
purpose
as
conducive
to
vital
religion
and
as
intending
to
separate
the
truly
godly
and
renewed
portion
of
the
community
from
the
world
at
large
the
reformation
epoch
had
seen
the
english
middle
and
lower
classes
generally
adopting
the
proper
names
of
scripture
thus
the
sterner
puritan
had
found
a
list
of
bible
names
that
he
would
gladly
have
monopolized
shared
in
by
half
the
english
population
that
a
father
should
style
his
child
nehemiah
or
abacuck
or
tabitha
or
dorcas
he
discovered
with
dismay
did
not
prove
that
that
particular
parent
was
under
any
deep
conviction
of
sin
this
began
to
trouble
the
minds
and
consciences
of
the
elect
fresh
limits
must
be
created
as
richard
and
roger
had
given
way
to
nathaniel
and
zerrubabel
so
nathaniel
and
zerrubabel
must
now
give
way
to
and
who
inaugurated
the
movement
with
what
success
and
how
it
slowly
waned
this
chapter
will
show
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
is
entirely
owing
to
barebone
and
the
parliament
that
went
by
his
name
the
impression
got
abroad
in
after
days
that
the
commonwealth
period
was
the
heyday
of
these
eccentricities
and
that
these
remarkable
names
were
merely
adopted
after
conversion
and
were
not
entered
in
the
as
baptismal
names
at
all
the
existence
of
these
names
could
not
escape
the
attention
of
lord
macaulay
and
sir
walter
scott
the
whig
historian
has
referred
to
tribulation
wholesome
and
busy
almost
as
frequently
as
to
that
boy
for
whose
average
abilities
to
the
very
end
of
his
literary
life
he
entertained
such
a
profound
respect
two
quotations
will
suffice
in
his
comic
dramatists
of
the
restoration
he
says
speaking
of
the
commonwealth
to
know
whether
a
man
was
really
godly
was
impossible
but
it
was
easy
to
know
whether
he
had
a
plain
dress
lank
hair
no
starch
in
his
linen
no
gay
furniture
in
his
house
whether
he
talked
through
his
nose
and
showed
the
whites
of
his
eyes
whether
he
named
his
children
and
again
in
his
essay
on
croker
boswell
life
of
johnson
he
declares
johnson
could
easily
see
that
a
roundhead
who
named
all
his
children
after
solomon
singers
and
talked
in
the
house
of
commons
about
seeking
the
lord
might
be
an
unprincipled
villain
whose
religious
mummeries
only
aggravated
his
fault
in
woodstock

as

these
entries
are
of
the
utmost
importance
they
begin
at
the
very
date
when
the
new
custom
arose
and
are
patronized
by
three
ministers
in
succession
possibly
four
if
thomas
lorde
was
also
a
clergyman
heley
case
is
yet
more
curious
he
had
been
prescribing
for
his
flock
shortly
before
the
birth
of
his

he
thus
practises

under
rectorial
pressure
the
villagers
followed
suit
and
for
half
a
century
warbleton
was
in
the
names
of
its
parishioners
a
complete
exegesis
of
justification
by

without
the
deeds
of
the

coupard
was
a
peripatetic
exhortation
to

and
vynall
was
a
standing
denunciation
of

no

is
better
worth

most
incontinently
in

who
would
inflict
such
a

on
an

they
did
not

so
then
the
point
however
is
that
the

was

a
more
historic
instance
may
be
given
john

puritan
rector
of

from

author
of

and
principles
of

minister
of

at
marden
in
kent
now
this
dudley
fenner
was
a
thoroughly
worthy
man
but
a
fanatic
of
most
intolerant
type
in
we
find
him
at
cranbrook
in
kent
an
account
of
his
sayings
and
doings
was
forwarded
says
strype
to
lord
burghley
who
himself
marked
the
following
passage
ye

pray
also
that
god
would
strike
through
the
sides
of
all
such
as
go
about
to
take
away
from
the
ministers
of
the
gospel
the
liberty
which
is
granted
them
by
the
word
of
god
but
a
curious
note
occurs
alongside
this
passage
in
lord
burghley
hand
names
given
in

by

two
of

again
got

through

of
nonconformity
after
an
imprisonment
of
twelve
months
he
fled
to
middleborough
in

and
died
there
about
the
above
incident
from
strype
is
interesting
for
here
manifestly
is
the
source
whence
camden
derived
his
information
upon
the
subject
in
his
quaint

published
thirty
years
later

but
such
an
eccentricity
is
to
be
expected
in
the
parish
over
which
wheatley
presided
the
too
of
extravagant
puritanism
we
all
remember
drunken
barnaby

where
i
saw
a
puritane
one
hanging
of

the
point
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
this
was

even
to
his
extreame
old
age
and
for
some
yeares
after
he
was

as
his

tells

are

have
given

many
a
twinge

conscience
afterwards
had
the
puritan
clergy
confined
these
vagaries
to
their
own
nurseries
it
would
not
have
mattered
much
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
they
used
their
influence
to
bias
the
minds
of
godparents
and
witnesses
in
the
same
direction
we
have
only
to
pitch
upon
a
minister
who
came
under
the
archbishop

disaffected
seek
out
the
church
over
which
he
presided
scan
the
register
of
baptisms
during
the
years
of
his
incumbency
and
a
batch
of
extravagant
names
will
at
once
be
unearthed
in
the
villages
of
sussex
and
kent
where
the
personal
influence
of
the
recalcitrant
clergy
seems
to
have
been
greatest
the
parochial
records
teem
with
them
thus
was
the
final
stage
of
fanaticism
reached
the
year
being
as
nearly
as
possible
the
exact
date
of
its
development
thus
were
english
people
being
prepared
for
the
influx
of
a
large
batch
of
names
which
had
never
been
seen
before
nor
will
be
again
the
purely
biblical
names
those
that
commemorated
bible
worthies
swept
over
the
whole
country
and
left
ineffaceable
impressions
the
second
stage
of
puritan
excess
names
that
savour
of
eccentricity
and
fanaticism
combined
scarcely
reached
england
north
of
trent
and
for
lack
of
volume
have
left
but
the
faintest
traces
they
lasted
long
enough
to
cover
what
may
be
fairly
called
an
epoch
and
extended
just
far
enough
to
embrace
a
province
the
epoch
was
a
hundred
years
and
the
province
was
from
kent
to
hereford
making
a
small
arc
northwards
so
as
to
take
in
bedfordshire
leicestershire
buckinghamshire
and
oxfordshire
the
practice
so
far
as
the
bolder
examples
is
concerned
was
a
on
the
part
of
the
presbyterian
clergy
on
this
point
the
evidence
is
in
all
respects
conclusive
iii
curious
names
not
puritan
several
names
found
in
the
registers
at
this
time
though
commonly
ascribed
to
the
zealots
must
be
placed
under
a
different
category
for
instance
original
sin
and
the
ninth
article
would
seem
to
be
commemorated
in
such
a
name
as
original
we
may
reject
camden
theory
originall
may
seem
to
be
deducted
from
the
greek
that
is
borne
in
good
time
inasmuch
as
he
does
not
appear
to
have
believed
in
it
himself
the
name
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
given
in
the
early
part
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
certain
families
of
position
to
the
eldest
son
and
heir
denoting
that
in
him
was
carried

the

the
record
of
whose
death
i
can
not
find
and
his

heir
who
was
baptized
december
the
first
of
these
must
have
been
born
in
far
too
early
a
date
for
the
name
to
be
fathered
upon
the
puritans
was
in

in
the

april
petition

whitley
widow

thomas
whitley
citizen

the
suggestion
from
the
editorial
pen
is
that
this
seuce
as
he
prints
it
is
a
bewildered
spelling
of
susey
from
susan
the
fact
is
seuce
is
a
bewildered
misreading
on

part
of

and
sense

several
of
the

will
prove
that

remaines
the
name
became
obsolete
by
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
being
a
saintly
title
was
sufficiently
odious
to
the
presbyterians
to
be
carefully
rejected
by
them
in
the
sixteenth
century
men
who
refused
the
apostles
their
saintly
title
were
not
likely
to
stamp
the
same
for
life
on
weak
flesh
nor
can
or
be
brought
as
charges
against
the
puritans
both
flatly
contradicted

yet
both
and
especially
the
former
have
been
attributed
to
the
zealots
no
names
could
have
been
more
offensive
to
them
than
these

this
is

the

continues
yea
it
seems
to
me
not
fit
for
christian
humility
to
call
a
man
or
giving
the
names
of
angels
to
the
sons
of
mortality
if
the
puritans
objected
as
they
did
to
a
man
to
the
use
of
gabriel

michael
as
angelic
names
the
generic
term
itself
would

terminated

after

the

ditto
without
entering
into
controversy
i
will
only
say
that
if
the
clergy
up
to
the
time
of
the
alteration
in
our
article
on
baptism
truly
believed
that
insomuch
as
infants
and
children
dying
in
their
infancy
shall
undoubtedly
be
saved
thereby
baptism
else
it
was
natural
that
such
a
delicate
ceremonial
as
i
have
hinted
at
should
have
suggested
itself
to
their
minds
after
the
reformation
the
practice
as
to
unborn
children
fell
into
desuetude
and
the
names
with
it
iv
instances
the
elder
disraeli
reminded
us
in
his
curiosities
of
literature
that
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
it
was
common
for
our
more
learned
pundits
to
themselves
in
their
own
studies
by
greek
and
latin
names
some
of
these
as
for
instance
erasmus
and
melancthon
are
only
known
to
the
world
at
large
by
their
adopted
titles
the
reformation
had
not
become
an
accomplished
fact
before
this
custom
began
to
prevail
in
england
only
it
was
transferred
from
the
study
to
the
font
and
from
scholars
to
babies
renovata
renatus
donatus
and
beata
began
to
grow
common
camden
writing
in

of
still
stranger
names
if
that
any
among
us
have
named
their
children
remedium
amoris
or
with
names
i
know
some
will
think
it
more
than
a
vanity
remaines
while
however
the
presbyterian
clergy
did
not
object
to
some
of
these
latin
sobriquets
as
being
identical
with
the
names
of
early
believers
of
the
primitive
church
stamped
in
not
a
few
instances
with
the
honours
of
martyrdom
they
preferred
to
translate
them
into
english
many
of
my
examples
of
eccentricity
will
be
found
to
be
nothing
more
than
literal
translations
of
names
that
had
been
in
common
vogue
among
christians
twelve
and
thirteen
hundred
years
before
to
the
majority
of
the
puritan
clergy
to
change
the
latin
dress
for
an
english
equivalent
would
be
as
natural
and
imperative
as
the
adoption
of
tyndale
or
the
genevan
bible
in
the
place
of
the
latin
vulgate
a
curious
though
somewhat
later
proof
of
this
statement
is
met
with
in
a
will
from
the

hence
the

the

in
furnishing
instances
we
naturally
begin
with
those
grace
names
in
all
cases
culled
from
the
registers
of
the
period
which
belong
to
what
we
may
style
the
first
stage
they
were
one
by
one
but
taken
from
the
lists
found
in
the
new
testament
and
were
probably
suggested
at
the
outset
by
the
moralities
or
interludes
the
morality
went
between
the
old
or
mystery
and
the
regular
drama
in
every
man
written
in
the
reign
of
henry
it
is
made
a
vehicle
for
retaining
the
love
of
the
people
for
the
old
ways
the
old
worship
and
the
old
superstitions
from
the
time
of
edward
vi
to
the
middle
of
reign
there
issued
a
cluster
of
interludes
of
this
same
moral
type
and
cast
only
all
breathed
of
the
new
religion
and
more
or
less
assaulted
the
dogmas
of
rome
these
moralities
were
popular
and
were
frequently
rendered
in
public
until
the
elizabethan
drama
was
well
established
all
were
allegorical
and
required
personal
representatives
of
the
abstract
graces
and
doctrines
of
which
they
treated
the
in
hickscorner
are
freewill
perseverance
pity
contemplation
and
imagination
and
in
the
interlude
of
youth
humility
pride
charity
and
lechery
it
is
just
possible
therefore
that
several
of
these
grace
names
were
originated
under
the
shadow
of
the
church
the
following
are
early

they
are
found
in

speaking
from

nomenclatural
point
of
view
the
name
did
not
survive
for
the
last
instance
i
have
met
with
is
that
of
faithful
meakin
curate
of
mobberley
cheshire
in
earwaker
east
cheshire
it
had
had
a
run
of
more
than
a
century
however
the
reader
will
have
observed
that
the
majority
of
these
names
have
become
obsolete
the
religious
apathy
of
the
early
eighteenth
century
was
against
them
they
seem
to
have
made
their
way
slowly
westward
certainly
their
latest
representatives
are
to
be
found
in
the
more
retired
villages
of
gloucestershire
and
devonshire
a
few
like
mercy
faith
hope
charity
grace
and
prudence
still
survive
and
will
probably
for
ever
command
a
certain
amount
of
patronage
but
they
are
much
more
popular
in
our
religious
than
the
church
registers
the
absence
of
the
rest
is
no
great
loss
i
imagine
the
zealots
of
elizabeth
later
days
began
to
weary
of
names
that
merely
made
household
words
of
the
apostolic
virtues
many
of
these
sobriquets
had
become
popular
among
the
unthinking
and
careless
they
began
to
stamp
their
offspring
with
exhortatory
sentences
pious
ejaculations
brief
professions
of
godly
sorrow
for
sin
or
exclamations
of
praise
for
mercies
received
i
am
bound
to
confess
however
that
the
prevailing
tone
of
these
names
is
rather
contradictory
of
the
picture
of
gloomy
sourness
drawn
by
the
facile
pens
of
macaulay
and
walter
scott
is
true
anger
and
wrath

dare

he

like

bear
a
gentleman
of
kent
who
was
living
at
the
same
time
mentioned
elsewhere
in
these
pages
nevertheless
in
the
exhortatory
names
there
is
a
general
air
of
cheerful
assurance
the
most
celebrated
name
of
this
class
is
barebone
i
can
not
find
his
baptismal
entry
a
collection
of
verses
was
compiled
by
one
barbon
of
daventry
harleian
this
can
not
have
been
his
father
as
we
have
evidence
that
the
leatherseller
was
born
about
and
allowing
his
parent
to
be
anything
over
twenty
the
date
would
be
too
early
for
exhortatory
names
like
we
may
presume
therefore
he
was
a
brother
two
other
brothers
are
said
to
have
been
entitled
respectively
barebone
and
barebone
i
say
entitled
for
i
doubt
whether
either
received
such
a
long
string
of
words
in
baptism
brook
in
his
history
of
the
puritans
implies
they
were
hume
says
that
both
were
names
and
adds
in
regard
to
the
latter
that
his
acquaintance
were
so
wearied
with
its
length
that
they
styled
him
by
the
last
word
as
damned
barebone
the
editor
of
and
march
says
that
as
his
morals
were
not
of
the
best
this
abbreviated
form
appeared
to
suit
him
better
than
his
entire
baptismal
prefix
whether
the
title
was
given
at
the
font
or
adopted
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
was
familiarly
known
as
damned
barebone
this
was
more
curt
than
courteous
of
history
little
items
have
leaked
out
he
began
life
as
a
leatherseller
in
fleet
street
and
owned
a
house
under
the
sign
of
the
lock
and
key
in
the
parish
of
he
was
admitted
a
freeman
of
the
leathersellers
company
january
he
was
a
fifth
monarchy
man
if
a
tract
printed
in
entitled
a
declaration
of
several
of
the
churches
of

and
godly
people
in
and
about
the
city
of
london
which
mentions
the
church
which
walks

barebone
refers
to
him
this
however
may
be
barebone
was
imprisoned
after
the
restoration
but
after
a
while
released
and
died
at
the
age
of
eighty
or
above
in
obscurity
his
life
which
was
not
without
its
excitements
was
spent
in
london
and
possibly
his
baptismal
entry
will
be
found
there
a
word
or
two
about
his
surname
the
elder
disraeli
says
curiosities
of
literature
there
are
unfortunate
names
which
are
very
injurious
to
the
cause
in
which
they
are
engaged
for
instance
the
long
parliament
in
cromwell
time
called
by
derision
the
rump
was
headed
by
one
barebones
a
leatherseller
isaac
disraeli
has
here
perpetuated
a
mistake
barebone
parliament
was
the
parliament
of
barebone
not
barebones

his
desiderata

barborne
while
echard
writes
the
name
barbon
when
referring
to
barbon
one
of
the
chief
rebuilders
of
the
city
of
london
after
the
fire
between
barebones
and
barbon
is
a
wide
gap
and
barbon
parliament
suggests
nothing
ludicrous
whatsoever
yet
if
we
set
aside
the
baptismal
name
what
an
amount
of
ridicule
has
been
cast
over
this
same
parliament
on
account
of
a
surname
which
in
reality
has
been
made
to
meet
the
occasion
no
historian
has
heaped
more
sarcasm
on
the
rump
than
hume
but
he
never
styles
the
leatherseller
as
anything
but
barebone
but
while
has
obtained
exceptional
notoriety
not
so
and
yet
there
was
a
day
when
bade
fair

however

doubtless
she
was
related
to
william

born
the
great
puritan
commentator

this
can
not

instance
of
the

nutter

a

twenty
years
before

its

m
wood

i
think
we
may
see
whence
greenhill
name
was
derived
returning
once
more
to
warbleton
is
so
common
there
as
in
other
places
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
the
mother
had
died
in
childbirth
in
every
instance
a
glance
at
the
register
of
deaths
disproves
the
idea
the
fact
is
was
used
like
repent
as
a
serious
call
to
godly
sorrow
for
sin

neither

my

prove
at

a

for

a

it

he
fulfilled

restored
three
of

probably
he
had

of

seems

have
discovered
a

melancholy
satisfaction
in
the
fact
that
the
quaint
names
of

were
subjected
to
the
raillery
of

wicked

one
of

was

clark

of
him
he
writes
he
had
been
constant
minister
of
the
parish
for
nigh
upon
sixty
years
he
carried
puritanism
in
his
very
name
by
which
his
good
father
intended
he
should
bear
the
memorial
of
god
holy
day
this
was
a
course
that
some
in
those
times
affected
baptizing
their
children
reformation
discipline
as
the
affections
of
their
parents
stood
engaged
for
this
they
have
sufficiently
suffered
from
profane
wits
and
this
worthy
person
did
so
in
particular
yet
his
name
was
not
a
greater
offence
to
such
persons
than
his
holy
life
probably
calamy
was
referring
to
the
profane
wit
cosin
bishop
of

who
in

held
at

called

him

that
this
was
a
deliberate
insult
and
not
a
pleasantry
calamy
of

would
stoutly
maintain
hence
the
above
sample
of
holy
ire
many
of
the
names
in
the
list
i
have
recorded
must
have
met
with
the
raillery
of
the
folk
the
strangely
stigmatized

in

however
the

the
people
he
was
accustomed
to
mix
with
got
used
to
it
it
is
true
they
must
have
resorted
not
unfrequently
to
curter
forms
much
after
the
fashion
of
the
now
almost
forgotten
nick
forms
of
the
plantagenet
days
is
a
very
large
mouthful
if
you
come
to
try
it
and
i
dare
say
white
or
brown
whoever
he
might
be
did
not
so
strongly
urge
as
he
ought
to
have
done
the
gross
impropriety
of
his
friends
recognizing
him
by
the
simple
style
of
faith
or
fight
fancy
at
a
dinner
in
a
day
that
had
not
invented
the
convenient
practice
of
calling
a
man
by
his
surname
having
to
address
a
friend
across
the
table
please
pass
the
pepper
the
thing
was
impossible
even
was
found
cumbersome
and
as
we
have
seen
the
rector
of

curtailed
it
a
curious

of
waggery

is

records
as
is
mentioned
in
the

the

is
to

and
he
took
him
a
potsherd
to
scrape
himself
withal
and
he
sat
down
among
the
ashes
this
was
somewhat
grim
fun
though
probably
during
his
brief
life
would
be
styled
by
the
curter
title
of
ashes
it
is
somewhat
curious
to
notice
that
camden
writing
three
years
later
says
ashes
existed
perhaps
this
was
the
instance
a
similar
instance
of
waggery
is
found
in
the
parish
church
of
old
swinford
where
the
following
entry
occurs
baptized
sonn
of
williams
allowing
the
father
to
be
thirty
years
of
age
the
paternal
christening
would
take
place
in
which
would
be
a
likely
time
in
the
political
history
of
england
for
a
mimical
hit
at
puritan
eccentricity
there
is
a
capital
scene
in
the
ordinary
where
andrew
credulous
after
trolling
out
a
verse
of
nonsensical
rhyme
against
the
puritan
names
says
to
his
friends
hearsay
and
slicer
in
allusion
to
these
new
long
and
uncouth
names

you

to

o
from
this
quotation
it
will
be
seen
that
it
is
not
to
the
church
register
alone
we
must
turn
to
discover
the
manner
in
which
these
new
names
were
being
received
by
the
public
calamy
might
wax
wroth
over
the
profane
wits
of
the
day
but
one
of
the
severest
blows
administered
to
the
men
he
has
undertaken
to
defend
came
from
his
own
side
for
thomas
adams
rector
of
benet
paul
wharf
must
unquestionably
be
placed
even
by
calamy
own
testimony
among
the
puritan
clergy
of
his
day
his
name
does
not
appear
in
the
list
of
silenced
clergy
and
his
works
are
dedicated
to
pronounced
friends
of
the
noncomformist
cause
in
his
meditations
upon
the
creed
vol
iii
edit
first
published
in
he
says
some
call
their
sons
this
is
too
bold
the
name
is
proper
to
christ
therefore
not
to
be
communicated
to
any
creature
it
is
no
less
than
presumption
to
give
a
subject
son
the
style
of
his
prince
yea
it
seems
to
me
not
fit
for
christian
humility
to
call
a
man
or
giving
the
names
of
angels
to
the
sons
of
mortality
on
the
other
side
it
is
a
petulant
absurdity
to
give
them
ridiculous
names
the
very
rehearsing
whereof
causeth
laughter
there
be
certain
affectate
names
which
mistaken
zeal
chooseth
for
honour
but
the
event
discovers
a
proud
singularity
it
was
the
speech
of
a
famous
prophet
sum
melior
patribus
am
no
better
than
my
fathers
but
such
a
man
will
be
patribus
than
his
fathers
as
if
they
would
tie
the
goodness
of
the
person
to
the
signification
of
the
name
but
still
a
man
is
what
he
is
not
what
he
is
called
he
were
the
same
with
or
without
that
title
or
that
name
and
we
have
known
and
names
not
found
in
sacred
story
but
familiar
to
our
country
prove
as
gracious
saints
as
any
or
such
like
which
have
been
rather
descriptions
than
names
i
have
quoted
portions
of
this
before
i
have
now
given
it
in
full
for
it
is
trenchant
and
full
of
common
sense
coming
from
the
quarter
it
did
we
can
not
doubt
it
had
its
effect
in
throwing
the
practice
into
disfavour
among
the
better
orders
but
there
had
been
a
continued
battery
going
on
from
a
foe
by
whose
side
adams
would
have
rather
faced
death
than
fight
years
before
he
wrote
his
own
sentiments
the
puritan
nomenclature
had
been
roughly
handled
on
the
stage
and
by
such
ruthless
pens
as
ben
jonson
cowley
and
beaumont
and
fletcher
a
year
before
little
was
laid
to
rest
the
sharp
and
unsparing
sarcasm
of
the
alchemist
and
bartholomew
fair
had
been
levelled
at
these
doings
the
first
of
these
two
dramas
ben
jonson
saw
acted
in
by
that
time
the
custom
was
a
generation
old
and
men
who
bore
the
godly
but
uncouth
sobriquets
were
walking
the
streets
keeping
shops
driving
bargains
known
if
not
avoided
of
all
men
in
increase
brown
your
apprentice
might
be
demanding
an
advance
upon
his
wages
jones
might
be
imploring
your
patronage
while
robinson
might
be
diligently
studying
his
ledger
to
see
how
he
could
swell
his
total
against
you
for
tobacco
and
groceries
in
society
would
be
really
awake
to
the
fact
that
such
things
existed
and
proceed
to
discuss
this
matter
in
a
manner
the
time
was
exactly
ripe
for
the
playwright
and
it
was
the
fate
of
the
presbyterians
that
the
playwright
was
rare
ben
in
the
alchemist
appears
a
deacon
who
is
thus
questioned
by
subtle
what
are
you
sir
please
you
a
servant
of
the
exiled
brethren

with

very
zealous
pastor

being
related

cozened

meets
tribulation
himself
the
amsterdam
pastor
whom
he
treats
with
scant
courtesy
nor
shall
you
need

libel
the
prelates
and
shorten
so
your
ears
against
the
hearing
of
the
next
grace
nor
of
necessity
rail
against
plays
to
please
the
alderman
whose
daily
custard
you
devour
nor
lie
with
zealous
rage
till
you
are
hoarse
not
one
of
these
so
singular
arts
nor
call
yourselves
by
name
of
and
such
like
affected
by
the
whole
family
or
wood
of
you
only
for
glory
and
to
catch
the
ear
of
your
disciple
to
which
hard
thrust
tribulation
meekly
makes
response
truly
sir
they
are
ways
that
the
godly
brethren
have
invented
for
propagation
of
the
glorious
cause
every
word
of
this
harangue
of
subtle
would
tell
upon
a
sympathetic
audience
so
popular
was
the
play
itself
that
a
common
street
song
was
made
out
of
it
the
first
verse
of
which
we
find
credulous
singing
in
the
ordinary
my

ananias

our
vicar
did
hold
bias

iv
sc
this
comedy
appeared
twenty
years
after
the
alchemist
and
yet
the
song
was
still
popular
many
a
lad
with
a
puritan
name
must
have
had
these
rhymes
flung
into
his
teeth
by
the
way
is
one
of
the
names
given
in
camden
list
written
four
years
later
than
ben

this
name
which
has
been
the
object
of
an
antiquary
a
playwright
a
and
an
historian
ridicule
for
macaulay
had
his
fling
at
it
curiously
enough
i
have
not
found
in
the
registers
but
its
equivalent
occurs
as
we
have
seen
in
the
chancery

in
the
case

by
pougher
and
by
travis
june
still
more
severe
again
is
this
same
dramatist
in
bartholomew
fair
which
was
performed
in
london
october
by
the
retinue
of
lady
elizabeth
james
daughter
pouring
ridicule
upon
the
butt
of
the
day
whose
name
of
puritan
was
to
be
anagrammatized
into
a
turnip
from
the
cropped
roundness
of
his
head
this
drama
became
the
favourite
it
was
suppressed
during
the
commonwealth
and
one
of
the
first
to
be
revived
at
the
restoration
the
king
is
said
to
have
given
special
orders
for
its
performance
whether
his
grandfather
liked
it
as
much
may
be
doubted
for
it
once
or
twice
touches
on
doctrinal
points
and
james
thought
he
had
a
special
gift
for
theology
busy

a
banbury

even
more
celebrated

not
he
was
a
baker
sir
but
he
does
dream
now

see
visions
he
has
given
over
his
trade
i
remember
that
too
out
of
a
scruple
that
he
took
in
spiced
conscience
those
cakes
he
made
were
served
to
bridales
maypoles
morrices
and
such
profane
feasts
and
meetings
his
christian
name
is
yes
sir
busy
how
what
a

there
o
they
all
have
such
names
sir
he

they
will
not

you
thought
her

been
winnifred
did
you
not
i
did
indeed
he
would
have
thought
himself
a
stark
reprobate
if
it
had
all
this
would
be
caviare
to
the
cavalier
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
did
not
enjoy
it
more
than
his
grandparents
who
could
but
laugh
at
it
as
a
hit
religious
rather
than
political
the
allusion
to

us
of
corporal
oath
who
in
the
puritan
published
in

ii
sc
rails
at
the
zealots
for
the
mild
character
of
their
ejaculations
the
expression
oh
was
the
most
terrible
expletive
they
permitted
themselves
to
indulge
in
and
some
even
shook
their
heads
at
a
brother
who
had
thus
far
committed
himself
why
has
the
devil
possessed
you
that
you
swear
no
better
you
c

you
varlets
the
terms
godfather

godmother
were
rejected
by
the
disaffected
clergy
and
they
would
have
the
answer
made
in
the
name
of
the
sponsors
not
the

hence
they
styled

is
generally
concluded
by

renounce

wicked

no
exaggeration
of

for
we
have
foxe
to

bomby
the
rector
of
lydney
would
be
about
when
this
play
was
written
and
may
have
suggested
himself
the
sobriquet
the
names
are
all
but
identical
from
women
pleased
and
fletcher
to
cutter
of
coleman
street
and
cowley
is
a
wide
jump
but
we
must
make
it
to
complete
our
quotations
from
the
playwrights
although
brought
out
after
the
restoration
the
fun
about
names
was
not
yet
played
out
the
scene
is
laid
in
london
in
this
comedy
was
sorely
resented
by
the
zealots
and
led
the
author
to
defend
himself
in
his
preface
he
says
that
he
has
been
accused
of
prophaneness
there
is
some
imitation
of
scripture
phrases
god
forbid
there
is
no
representation
of
the
true
face
of
scripture
but
only
of
that
vizard
which
these
hypocrites
draw
upon
it
this
must
have
been
more
trying
to
bear
even
than

whispered

keyhole

we
beg
his
pardon

the
arguments

could
urge
in
his

to
meet
the
charge
of
irreverence
sussex

strongest
indictments

a

says
an

speaks

evidently
unaware

were
all

the

is
this
the

the

they
are
a
collection
of
names
existing

everything
vouches

their
authenticity

thomas
adams
in
his
meditations
upon
the
creed
in
a
passage
already
quoted
testified
to
its
existence
in
the
conclusion
is
irresistible
the
names
are
authentic
and
the
panel
may
have
been
with
puritan
it
may
be
asked
whether
or
not
the
world
went
beyond
scoffing
was
the
stigma
of
a
puritan
name
a
hindrance
to
the
worldly
advancement
of
the
bearer
it
is
pleasant
in
contradiction
of
any
such
theory
to
quote
the
following
aug
petition
of
evans
to
the
king
for
an
order
that
he
may
receive

of

thus
it
will
be
seen
that
in
the
general
rush
for
places
of
preferment
at
the
restoration
there
were
men
and
women
bearing
names
of
the
most
marked
puritanism
who
did
not
hesitate
to
forward
their
appeals
with
the
williams
and
richards
of
the
world
at
large
they
manifestly
did
not
suppose
their
sobriquets
would
be
any
bar
to
preferment
one
of
them
too
had
been
to
charles
in
his
exile
and
another
had
suffered
in
person
and
estate
as
a
devoted
adherent
of
royalty
we
may
hope
and
trust
therefore
that
all
this
scoffing
was
of
a
character
it
was
doubtless
the
prejudice
against
puritan
eccentricity
that
introduced
civil
titles
as
font
names
into
england
a
class
specially
condemned
by
cartwright
and
his
friends
at
any
rate
they
are
contemporary
with
the
excesses
of
fanatic
nomenclature
and
are
found
just
in
the
districts
where
the

if

except
for

neither
was
that
at

what
a
text
is
this
for
the
next
biographer
of
bunyan
if
he
have
the
courage
to
enter
upon
it
to
suggest
that
the
great
dreamer
was
not
a
reprobate
in
his
youth
and
thus
spoil
the
contrast
between
his
converted
and
unconverted
life
was
a
perilous
act
on
lord
macaulay
part
to
insinuate
that
he
had
a
not
altogether
unpleasant
time
of
it
in
the
bedford
gaol
that
he
could
have
his
friends
to
visit
him
and
on
the
face
of
it
ink
paper
and
quills
to
set
down
his
meditations
even
this
is
enough
to
set
a
section
of
political
and
religious
society
about
our
ears
but
to
hint
that
his
character
names
were
not
wholly
the
offspring
of
his
imagination
not
thought
out
in
the
isolation
of
his
dreary
captivity
and
not
pictured
in
his
brain
while
his
was
lying
upon
a
hard
and
comfortless
pallet
this
i
know
not
very
long
ago
would
have
brought
a
mob
about
me
in
the
present
day
i
shall
only
be
smiled
upon
with
contempt
and
condemned
to
a
righteous
ignominy
by
the
superior
judgment
of
the
worshippers
of
john
bunyan
nevertheless
i
ask
were
the
great
mass
of
bunyan
character
names
the
creation
of
his
own
brain
or
were
they
suggested
by
the
nomenclature
of
his
friends
or
neighbours
in
the
days
of
his
youth
it
is
the
peculiarity
of
the
names
in
the
pilgrim
progress
and
siege
of
mansoul
that
they
suggest
the
incidents
of
which
the
bearers
are
the
heroes
but
in
a
large
proportion
of
cases
these
names
already
existed
born
in
bunyan
saw
puritan
character
names
at
their
climax
living
at
elstow
he
was
within
the
limits
of
the

most
addicted
to
the
practice
he
had
seen
christian
and
hopeful
christiana
and
mercy
of

long
before
he
was
haled
to
prison
at
bedford
the
four
fair
damsels
discretion
piety
charity
and
prudence
may
and
must
have
in
part
been
his
companions
in
his
boyish
rambles
years
before
he
met
them
in
the
valley
of
humiliation
and
if
afterwards
in
the
siege
of
mansoul
he
turned
charity
into
a
man
he
was
only
doing
what
godfathers
and
godmothers
had
been
doing
for
thirty
years
previously
the
name

sweet
character

be
a
personal
reminiscence

of
his

expeditions

that
right
good

old

if
not
were
known
of
all

in

pastoral
avocations
and
as
for
the
men
that
were
panelled
in
the
trial
of
the
diabolonians
we
might
set
them
side
by

with

certainly
the
contrast

oddity
would
be
in

diffidence
will
be
found
i
doubt
not
to
have
been
at
large
before
bunyan
laid
him
down
in
a
den
where
names
of
evil
repute
come
and
they
are
many
we
do
not
expect
to
see
their
duplicates
in
the
flesh
and
were
not
names
for
the
puritan
but
their
contraries
were
meets
the
case
of
may
be
set
by
and
by
or
continent
is
directly
suggested
by
the
favourite
by
silence
that
john
bunyan
is
under
debt
to
the
puritans
for
many
of
his
characters
must
be
unquestionable
and
were
he
living
now
or
could
we
interview
him
where
he
is
i
do
not
doubt
we
could
extract
from
him
good
honest
man
the
ready
admission
that
in
the
names
of
the
personages
that
flit
before
us
in
his
unapproachable
allegory
and
which
have
charmed
the
fancy
of
old
and
young
for
so
many
generations
he
was
merely
stereotyping
the
recollections
of
childhood
and
commemorating
so
far
as
sobriquets
were
concerned
the
companionships
of
earlier
years
vii
the
influence
of
puritanism
on
american
nomenclature
baptismal
nomenclature
in
the
united
states
especially
in
the
old
settlements
bears
stronger
impressions
of
the
puritan
epoch
than
the
english
their
ancestors
were
puritans
who
had
fled
england
for
conscience
sake
their
life
too
in
the
west
was
for
generations
primitive
almost
patriarchal
in
its
simplicity
there
was
no
bantering
scorn
of
a
wicked
world
to
face
there
was
no
deliberate
effort
made
by
any
part
of
the
community
to
restore
the
old
names
to
this
day
the
impress
remains
take
up
a
story
of
backwood
life
such
as
american
female
writers
affect
so
much
and
it
will
be
inscribed
faith
girlhood
or
prudence
palfrey
all
the
children
that
figure
in
these
tales
are
truth
or
patience
or
charity
or
hope
the
true
descendants
of
the
early
settlers
are
to
a
man
woman
and
child
even
now
bearers
of
names
either
from
the
abstract
christian
graces
or
the
narratives
of
holy
scripture
of
course
the
constant
tide
of
immigration
that
has
set
in
has
been
gradually
telling
against
puritan
traditions
the
grotesque
in
name
selection
too
has
gone
further
in
some
of
the
more
retired
and
inaccessible
districts
of
the
states
than
the
eastern
border
or
in
england
generally
where
social
restraints
and
the
demands
of
custom
are
still
respected
if
we
are
to
believe
american
authorities
there
are
localities
where
humour
has
certainly
become
grim
and
the
solemn
rite
of
baptism
somewhat
burlesqued
by
a
selection
of
names
which
throw
into
the
shade
even
puritan
eccentricity
look
at
the
names
of
some
of

nathaniel
became

the

that

instituted

jonathan
was
not
to
be

to
it
for
a
moment
but
we
have
not
done
with
the
chaunceys
one
of
the
most
singular
accidents
that
ever
befell
nomenclature
has
befallen
them
what
has
happened

has
happened

in

chauncey
died
at

in
aged
he
was
a
great
patriot
preacher
and
philanthropist
at
a
critical
time
in
his
history
the
name
had
spread
too
and
no
wonder
that
it
suggested
itself
to
the
authoress
of
uncle
tom
cabin
as
a
character
name
she
however
placed
it
in
its
proper
position
as
a
surname
it
may
be
that
stowe
has
given
the
use
of
this
patronymic
as
a
baptismal
name
an
impulse
but
it
had
been
so
used
long
before
she
herself
was
born
it
was
a
memorial
of
charles
chauncey
of
boston
it
has
now
an
average
place
throughout
all
the
eastern

and
the
older

chauncey

seem
likely
to
run
a
race
in
the
two
countries
but
chauncey
has
much
the
best
of
it
at
present
another
circumstance
contributed
to
the
formation
of
americanisms
in
nomenclature
the
further
the
puritan
emigrants
drew
away
from
the
old
familiar
shores
the
more
predominant
the
spirit
of
liberty
grew
it
was
displayed
amongst
other
ways
in
the
names
given

born

it
was
an
outlet
for
their
enthusiasm

his

henry
frederic
and
among

thomas
maria

camden
if
we
take
this
sentence
literally
the
great
antiquary
who
knew
more
of
the
families
and
pedigrees
of
the
english
aristocracy
than
any
other
man
of
his
day
could
only
recall
to
his
mind
four
cases
of
double
christian
names
this
was
in
at
the
outset
therefore
there
is
significance
in
this
statement
blunt
in
his
annotated
says
of
or
in
the
catechism
was
anciently
used
as
the
initial
of
nomen
and
vel
was
expressed
by
vel
the
double
n
being
afterwards
corrupted
into
if
this
be
a
correct
explanation
must
refer
to
cases
where
more
than
one
child
was
brought
to
the
priest
standing
for
an
occasion
where
only
one
infant
was
presented
in
a
word
or
could
not
stand
for
thomas
or
thomas
henry
but
for
thomas
or
thomas
and
henry
if
this
be
unsatisfactory
then
blunt
explanation
is
unsatisfactory
camden
sentence
may
be
set
side
by
side
with
lord
coke
decision
in
his
first
institute
coke
upon
littleton
he
says
and
regularly
it
is
requisite
that
the
purchaser
be
named
by
the
name
of
baptism
and
his
surname
and
that
special
heed
be
taken
to
the
name
of
baptism
for
that
a
man
can
not
have
two
names
of
baptism
as
he
may
have
divers
surnames
again
he
adds
if
a
man
be
baptized
by
the
name
of
thomas
and
after
at
his
confirmation
by
the
bishop
he
is
named
john
he
may
purchase
by
the
name
of
his
confirmation
and
this
doth
agree
with
our
ancient
books
where
it
is
holden
that
a
man
may
have
divers
names
at
divers
times
but
not
divers
christian
names
this
is
all
very
plain
even
in
james
i
days
thousands
of
our
countrymen
had
no
fixed
surnames
and
changed
them
according
to
caprice
or
fancy
but
the
christian
name
was
a
fixture
saving
in
the
one
case
of
confirmation
lord
coke
is
referring
to
an
old
rule
laid
down
by
archbishop
peckham
wherein
any
child
whose
baptismal
name
by
accident
or
evil
thought
had
a
bad
significance
is
advised
if
not
compelled
to
change
it
for
one
of
more
christian
import
the
chief
point
of
interest
however
in
this
decision
of
lord
coke
is
the
patent
fact
that
no
thought
of
a
double
christian
name
is
present
in
his
mind
had
it
been
otherwise
he
would
never
have
worded
it
as
he
has
done
archbishop
peckham
rule
had
evidently
been
infringed
and
lord
coke
upholds
the
infringement
a
child
with
such
an
orthodox
name
as
thomas
a
name
with
no
immoral
significance
might
he
lays
it
down
become
john
at
confirmation
even
in
such
a
case
as
this
however
john
is
not
to
be
added
to
thomas
it
must
take
its
place
and
thomas
cease
to
be
recognized
lord
coke
of
course
was
aware
that
charles
i
queen
was
henrietta
maria
the
late
king
charles
james
and
his
son
henry
frederic
it
is
possible
nay
probable
that
he
was
not
ignorant
of
thomas
maria
wingfield
existence
or
that
of
thomas
posthumus
hobby
but
that
these
double
baptismal
names
should
ever
become
an
custom
that
the
lower
and
middle
classes
should
ever
adopt
them
that
even
the
higher
orders
should
ever
go
beyond
the
use
of
maria
and
posthumus
seems
never
to
have
suggested
itself
to
his
imagination
there
is
no
doubt
the
custom
came
from
france
in
the
first
instance
there
as
in
england
it
was
confined
to
the
royal
and
aristocratic
circles
the
second
son
of
catharine
de
medici
was
baptized
edward
alexander
in
mary
stuart
followed
the
new
fashion
in
the
names
of
her
son
charles
james
the
higher
nobility
of
england
slowly
copied
the
practice
but
within
most
carefully
prescribed
limits
one
limitation
was
the
double
name
must
be
one
already
patronized
by
royalty
henrietta
maria
found
her
title
repeated
in
henrietta
maria
stanley
daughter
of
the
james
earl
of
derby
who
for
his
determined
loyalty
was
beheaded
at
bolton
in
lancashire
in
she
was
born
on
the
of
november
and
was
buried
in
york
minster
on
the
of
january
sir
peter
ball
attorney
to
the
queen
of
charles
baptized
his
seventeenth
child
by
the
name
of
his
royal
mistress
henrietta
maria
he
followed
her
fortunes
after
as
before
the
execution
polwhel
devon
these
must
both
have
been
considered
remarkable
cases
in
their
day
the
loyalty
of
the
act
would
be
its
sanction
in
the
eyes
of
their
friends
but
while
some
copied
the
double
name
of
the
queen
also
the
name
of
the
queen
mother
other
nobles
who
had
boys
to
christen
mimicked
the
royal
nursery
of
james
henry
frederick
earl
of
arundel
was
born
in
and
henry
frederick
thynne
brother
of
lord
weymouth
was
created
a
baronet
in
no
one
need
doubt
the
origin
of
these
double
forms
again
loyalty
would
be
their
answer
against
objections
but
side
by
side
with
these
went
maria
used
for
either
sex
and
posthumus
or
posthuma
the
only
two
instances
recalled
by
camden
as
in
use
among
private
men
there
seems
good
reason
to
believe
that
for
two
or
three
generations
at
least
these
were
deemed
by
some
unwritten
code
the
only
permissible
second
names
outside
the
royal
list
the
case
of
wingfield
is
curious
three
generations
at
least
bore
a
second
name
maria
all
males
the
first
was
edward
maria
of
kimbolton
who
received
the
female
title
in
honour
of
and
from
the
princess
mary
daughter
of
henry
his
godmother
the
second
was
thomas
maria
adduced
by
camden
and
the
third
is
referred
to
in
the
following
document
april
bill
of
complaint
relative
to
the
sale
of
the
manor
of
keyston
hunts
by
edward
maria
c
maria
had
long
been
common
in
italy
france
and
spain
as
a
second
name
and
still
is
whether
for
a
boy
or
girl
the
child
being
thereby
specially
committed
to
the
protection
of
the
virgin
the
earliest
instances
in
england
however
were
directly
given
in
honour
of
two
royal
godmothers
who
happened
to
be
mary
in
one
case
and
henrietta
maria
in
the
other
hence
the
seeming
transference
of
the
foreign
second
name
maria
to
our
own
shores
thus
introduced
maria
began
to
circulate
in
society
generally
as
an
allowed
second
name
july
baptized
charles
maria
sonne
of
charles
chute
st
died
gulielma
maria
posthuma
springett
tablet
ringmer
lewes
sussex
this
last
was
a
bold
procedure
three
names
being
an
event
but
the
sponsor
might
reply
that
he
was
only
placing
together
the
two
recognized
second
names
maria
and
posthuma
later
on
maria
is
again
found
in
the
same
family
in
the
year
william
penn
the
quaker
married
gulielma
maria
daughter
of
sir
william
springett
posthuma
as
in
the
above
instance
or
posthumus
is
still
more
remarkable
the
idea
of
styling
a
child
by
this
name
thus
connecting
its
birth
with
the
father
antecedent
death
seems
to
have
touched
a
sympathetic
chord
and
the
practice
began
widely
to
prevail
the
first
example
i
have
seen
stands
as
a
single
name
thus
in
the
canterbury
cathedral
register
is
recorded
christened
posthumus
the
sonne
of
robert
pownoll
the
following
is
the
father
entry
of
burial
june
buried
robert
pownoll
this
is
the
earliest
instance
i
have
seen
very
soon
it
was
deemed
right
to
make
it
a
second
name
baptized
henry
postumus
son
of
james
doncaster
sir
thomas
posthumus
hoby
knight
lord
of
the
manor
of
hackness
died
in
he
bequeathed
the
greater
portion
of
his
estates
to
his
dearly
beloved
and
esteemed
cozen
john
sydenham
of
brimpton
somerset
who
being
baroneted
in
july
died
in
and
was
succeeded
by
his
son
sir
john
posthumus
sydenham
posthumus
possibly
in
this
case
was
commemorative
of
sir
thomas
and
not
of
sir
john
william
ball
son
of
sir
peter
ball
already
mentioned
married
maria
posthuma
hussey
this
must
have
occurred
before
the
commonwealth
but
i
have
not
the
exact
date
the
character
of
all
these
names
is
sufficient
proof
of
their
rarity
all
belong
with
one
exception
to
the
higher
ranks
of
society
all
were
called
after
the
children
in
the
royal
nursery
or
maria
or
posthuma
was
the
second
component
several
formed
the
double
name
with
both
it
seems
certain
that
at
first
it
was
expected
that
if
people
in
high
life
were
to
give
encouragement
to
the
new
fashion
they
must
do
so
within
certain
carefully
defined
limits
as
for
any
lower
class
it
was
never
imagined
that
they
would
dream
of
aspiring
to
such
a
daring
innovation
the
earliest
instance
of
this
class
i
find
still
has
mary
for
its
second
component
and
commemorates
two
english
queens
baptized
elizabeth
mary
being
of
the
age
of
and
upwards
daughter
to
john
allen
and
emm
his
wife
both
of
them
being
cant
cath
even
to
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
if
a
man
gave
his
child
a
double
name
it
must
be
to
commemorate
royalty
june
baptized
william
henry
son
of
jacob
janeway
and
francis
his
cant
cath
william
iii
was
christened
william
henry
speaking
of
mary
husband
we
may
add
that
two
of
the
most
familiar
conjunctions
of
the
present
day
among
the
middle
and
lower
classes
that
of
anna
maria
or
mary
ann
arose
similarly
in
italy
and
france
the
two
went
together
a
hundred
years
earlier
in
connection
with
the
virgin
and
her
mother
in
england
they
are
only
found
since
being
used
as
commemorative
of
the
sisters
anne
and
mary
both
queens
like
william
henry
the
combination
has
been
popular
ever
since
christened
of
james
hebert
mercer
march
christened
of
thomas

hoare
st
dionis
backchurch
the
clerk
of

church
could
not
understand
this
conjunction
not
to
add
that
his
education
seems
to
have
been
slightly
neglected
baptized
anammeriah
of
thomas
and
eliz
biby
m
ch
baptized
anameriah
of
richard
and
sarah
bell
these
are
the
first
double
names
to
be
found
in
this
register
the
latin
form
represents
the
then
prevailing
fashion
there
was
not
a

conjoined
names
returning
to
the
first
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
we
find
strong
testimony
of
the
rarity
of
these
double
names
and
a
feeling
that
there
was
something
akin
to
illegality
in
their
use
from
our
registers
wherein
an
attempt
was
made
to
glue
two
names
together
as
one
without
a
hyphen
or
a
second
capital

generation

here
the

has
been
anxious
to
commemorate
the
great
oxford
professor
the
father
of
international
law
abericus
gentilis
he
has
avoided
a
breach
of
supposed
national
law
by
writing
the
two
names
in
one
aprill
buried
jockaminshaw
butler
wife
of
james

in

the

here
again
is
the
inevitable
maria
but
so
inwoven
with
john
that
lord

legal
maxim
could
not
touch
the

it
is
the
same
in
the
following
example
married
john
pell
to
ithamaria
of
henry
reynolles
of
london
lower
worthies
of
sussex
one
of
the
most
strange
samples
of
conjoined
names
is
this
april
joane
whome
we
maye
call
yorkkooppe
because
she
was
ye
basterd
daughter
as
yt
is
comonlye
reported
of
one
john
york
and
anne

here
is
a
double
conjunction
john
and
anne
forming

york

cooper
yorkkooppe
the
first
is
neat
the
second
clumsy
but
doubtless
the
clerk
who
wielded
the
deemed
both
a
masterpiece
of
ingenuity
the
following
is
interesting
july
being
satterday
about
half
an

in

iii
hyphened
names
it
will
be
noticed
that
so
far
the
two
names
were
both
saving
in
the
case
of
aberycusgentylis
and
jockaminshaw
from
the
recognized
list
of
baptismal
names
about
the
reign
of
anne
the
idea
of
a
patronymic
for
a
second
name
seems
to
have
occurred
to
meet
the
supposed
legal
exigencies
the
two
names
were
simply
hyphened
we
will
confine
our
instances
to
the
register
of
canterbury
cathedral
baptized
son
of
lee
warner
esquire
and
mary
his
wife
july
baptized
son
of
william
ayerst
prebendary
of
this
church
baptized
son
of
james
horne
and
mary
his
wife
i
need
not
say
that
at
first
these
children
bore
the
name
in
common
parlance
of
or
or
the
two
were
never
separated
but
treated
as
one
name
to
this
day
traces
of
this
habit
are
to
be
found
i
know
an
old
gentleman
and
his
wife
people
of
the
old
school
dwelling
somewhat
out
of
the
world
who
address
a
child
invariably
by
all
its
baptismal
titles
the
effect
is
very
quaint
in
all
formal
and
legal
processes
the
two
or
three
names
have
to
be
employed
and
clergymen
who
only
recite
the
first
in
the
marriage
service
as
i
have
heard
some
do
are
in
reality
guilty
of
misdemeanour
how
odd
all
these
contrivances
to
modern
eyes
we
take
up
a
directory
and
every
other
registration
we
look
on
is
made
up
of
three
names
the
poorer
classes
are
even
more
particular
than
the
aristocracy
upon
the
point
the
describing
her
own
superior
merit
says
do
not
think
that
we
resemble
betsy
jane
or
mary
ann
women
born
in
lowly
cottage
bred
for
broom
or
and
yet
in
church
registers
out
of
fifty
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
england
there
will
not
be
found
a
single
instance
of
a
double
christian
name
previous
to
the
year
maskell
has
failed
to
find
any
instance
in
the
register
of
barking
and
the
harleian
society
publication
of
the
registers
of
peter
cornhill
and
dionis
backchurch
only
confirms
the
assertion
i
have
made
many
stories
have
arisen
upon
these
double
names
a
gray
bearing
the
once
familiar
christian
name
of
anketil
wanted
the
certificate
of
his
baptism
the
register
was
carefully
searched
in
vain
the
neighbouring
registers
were
as
thoroughly
scanned
in
vain
again
the
first
register
was
referred
to
and
upon
a
closer
investigation
he
was
found
entered
as
ann
kettle
gray
not
very
long
ago
a
child
was
brought
to
the
font
for
baptism
what
name
asked
the
parson
john
was
the
reply
anything
else
john
said
the
godparent
putting
in
an
h
where
it
was
not
needed
john
honly
i
baptize
thee
continued
the
clergyman
thus
thrown
off
his
guard
the
child
was
entered
with
the
double
name
in
gutch
geste
of
robin
hode
vol
there
is
a
curious
note
anent
maid
marian
wherein
some
french
writers
are
rebuked
for
supposing
marian
to
be
composed
of
mary
and
ann
and
the
statement
is
made
that
it
is
from
mariamne
the
wife
of
herod
marian
or
marion
of
course
is
the
diminutive
of
mary
the
other
pet
form
being
mariot
nevertheless
the
great
commonness
of
the
double
christian
name
mary
ann
is
consequent
on
the
idea
that
marian
is
compounded
of
both
in
the
registers
of
marriages
at
halifax
parish
church
december
is
the
name
of
a

he

was

third
child
of
his
parents
two
sisters
faith
and
hope
having
preceded
him
his
full
baptismal
name
is
and
charity
and
in
his
own
marriage
certificate
his
name
is
so
written
in
ordinary
affairs
he
is
content
with
charity
alone
and
august
this
could
not
have
happened
previous
to
queen
anne
reign
pegden
will
was
administered
upon
in
his
four
elder
brothers
bore
the
four
evangelists
names
this
again
could
not
well
have
occurred
before
the
eighteenth
century
was
in
in
yorkshire
directories
one
may
see
such
entries
as
john
berry
and
immediately
below
young
john
berry
this
represents
a
common
pleasantry
at
the
font
among
the
tykes
but
is
necessarily
modern
nor
could
sir
isaac
or
sir
robert
as
prænomens
to
newton
or
peel
have
been
originated
at
any
distant
period
iv
the
decay
of
single
patronymics
in
baptism
the
introduction
of
double
baptismal
names
produced
a
revolution
as
immediate
as
it
was
unintentional
it
put
a
stop
to
what
bade
fair
to
become
a
universal
adoption
of
patronymics
as
single
baptismal
names
this
practice
took
its
rise
about
the
year
it
became
customary
in
highly
placed
families
to
christen
the
eldest
son
by
the
name
of
the
landed
estate
to
which
he
was
heir
especially
was
it
common
when
the
son
succeeded
to
property
through
his
mother
then
the
mother
surname
was
his
christian
name
with
the
introduction
of
second
baptismal
names
this
custom
ceased
and
the
boy
or
girl
as
the
case
might
be
after
a
first
orthodox
name
of
robert
or
cecilia
received
as
a
second
the
patronymic
that
before
was
given
alone
instead
of
neville
clarke
the
name
would
be
charles
neville
clarke
from
the
year
say
this
has
been
a
growing
custom
and
half
our
present
list
of
treble
names
are
thus
formed
the
custom
of
giving
patronymic
names
was
for
a
century
at
least
peculiar
to
england
and
is
still
rare
on
the
continent
camden
notices
the
institution
of
the
practice
whereas
in
late
yeares
sirnames
have
beene
given
for
christian
names
among
us
and
no
where
else
in
christendome
although
many
dislike
it
for
that
great
inconvenience
will
ensue
neverthelesse
it
seemeth
to
procede
from
hearty
goodwill
and
affection
of
the
godfathers
to
shew
their
love
or
from
a
desire
to
continue
and
propagate
their
owne
names
to
succeeding
ages
and
is
in
no
wise
to
bee
disliked
but
rather
approoved
in
those
which
matching
with
heires
generall
of
worshipfull
ancient
families
have
given
those
names
to
their
heires
with
a
mindefull
and
thankfull

them

we

now

says
reader
i
am
confident
an
instance
can
hardly
be
produced
of
a
surname
made
christian
in
england
save
since
the
reformation
since
it
hath
been
common
worthies
i
for
two
hundred
years
this
custom
had
the
widest
popularity
among
the
higher
classes
and
from
some
of
our
registers
there
are
traces
that
the
lower
orders
were
about
to
adopt
the
practice
in
the
case
of
female
heiresses
the
effect
is
odd
however
this
was
got
over
sometimes
by
giving
a
feminine
termination

the

but
through

introduction

the
practice
is
now
rare
and
all
but
entirely
confined
to
boys
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
it
was
quite
as
popular
with
the
other
sex
both
dudley

sydney

have
been
used
so
frequently
that
they
have
now
taken
a
place
in
our
ordinary
list
of
baptismal
names
so
far
as
sydney
is
concerned
the
reason
is
easily
explained
the
smith
family
have
been
so
fond
of
commemorating
the
great
sydney
that
it
has
spread
to
other
families
chauncey
and
washington
occupy
the
same
position
in
the
united
states
the
influence
of
foundling
names
upon
double
baptismal
names
one
circumstance
that
contributed
to
the
adoption
of
two
baptismal
names
was
the
christening
of
foundlings
having
no
father
or
mother
to
attest
their
parentage
being
literally
anonymous
there
sprang
up
a
custom
about
the
year
of
baptizing
these
children
with
a
double
title
only
the
second
one
was
supposed
to
be
the
surname
and
not
a
baptismal
name
at
all
this
second
name
was
always
a
local
name
betokening
the
precise
spot
street
or
parish
where
the
child
was
found
every
old
register
has
its
numerous
instances

however
helpless
discovered
on
the
doorstep
the
gossips
would
have
their
nods
and
becks
and
wreathed
smiles
if
they
said
nothing
upon
the
subject
it
was
a
common
dodge
to
leave
it
on
a
premises
april
a
man
child
was
laid
at
sir
edward
osbourne
gate
and
was
named
dennis
philpot
and
so
brought
to
christes
ospitall
the
same
practice
prevails
in
america
a

correspondent
wrote

me
the

a
fine
boy
of
about
four
months
was
left
in
the
porch
of

church
rectory
in
brooklyn
he
was
baptized
by
the
name

our
forefathers
did
not
seem
to
perceive
it
but
in
all
these
cases
double
baptismal
names
were
given
it
must
however
have
had
its
unfelt
influence
in
leading
up
to
the
new
custom
and
especially
to
patronymics
as
second
names
we
are
all
now
familiarized
to
these
double
and
treble
names
the
poorest
and
the
most
abject
creatures
that
bring
a
child
to
the
font
will
have
their
string
of
grand
and
titles
sometimes
such
a
mouthful
that
the
parson
wonder
is
excited
whence
they
accumulated
them
till
wonder
is
lost
in
apprehension
lest
he
should
fail
to
deliver
himself
of
them
correctly
the
difficulty
is
increased
when
the
name
is
pronounced
as
the
fancy
or
education
of
the
sponsor
dictates
when
one
of
three
names
is
hugginy
the
minister
may
be
excused
if
he
fails
to
understand
all
at
once
that
eugénie
is
intended
such
an
incident
occurred
about
six
years
ago
and
the
flustered
parson
on
a
second
inquiry
was
not
helped
by
the
woman
rejoinder
yes
hugginy
the
way
ladies
does
their
you
know
we
must
confess
we
are
not
anxious
to
see
the
new
custom
for
new
it
is
in
reality
spread
but
we
fear
much
it
will
do
so
we
have
reached
the
stage
when
three
baptismal
names
are
almost
as
common
as
two
and
we
can
not
but
foresee
if
this
goes
on
that
before
the
century
is
out
our
present
will
be
compelled
to
have
the
space
allotted
to
the
font
names
enlarged
as
it
is
the
parson
is
often
at
his
