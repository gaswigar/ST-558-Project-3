chapter
one
morning
in
the
grifoni
palace
near
the
banks
of
the
river
arno
in
an
upper
room
of
the
beautiful
old
palace
of
the
grifoni
family
beppina
the
daughter
of
the
marchese
lay
peacefully
sleeping
in
his
own
room
across
the
hall
from
hers
beppo
her
twin
brother
slept
also
though
it
was
already
early
dawn
of
easter
saturday
in
the
city
of
florence
and
both
children
had
meant
to
be
up
before
the
sun
that
no
hour
of
the
precious
holiday
should
be
lost
in
sleep
it
was
the
jingle
of
donkey
bells
and
the
sound
of
laughing
voices
in
the
street
below
her
windows
that
at
last
roused
beppina
though
it
was
not
yet
light
the
peasants
were
already
pouring
into
the
city
from
outlying
villages
and
farms
bringing
their
families
in
or
wagons
drawn
by
sleek
oxen
to
enjoy
the
wonderful
events
which
were
to
take
place
in
the
city
on
that
holy
day
beppina
opened
her
great
dark
eyes
and
sat
up
in
bed
to
listen
awake
before
beppo
she
whispered
joyfully
to
herself
i
told
him
i
should
be
first
i
wonder
what
time
it
is
as
if
in
answer
to
her
question
a
distant
clock
struck
five
five
murmured
beppina
and
struggling
to
her
knees
in
her
great
carved
bed
she
dipped
a
dainty
finger
in
the
vase
of
holy
water
which
hung
on
the
wall
near
by
and
crossed
herself
devoutly
then
folding
her
hands
she
murmured
an
ave
maria
before
the
image
of
the
virgin
which
stood
on
the
little
table
beside
her
bed
this
duty
done
she
slid
to
the
floor
thrust
her
little
white
feet
into
a
pair
of
blue
felt
slippers
and
her
arms
into
the
sleeves
of
a
gay
wrapper
then
ran
across
the
room
to
the
eastern
windows
as
she
pushed
open
the
shutters
a
gleam
of
sunshine
flashed
across
the
room
lighting
the
dim
frescoes
on
the
high
ceiling
and
paling
the
light
of
the
little
lamp
which
burned
before
the
image
of
the
madonna
a
wandering
breeze
fresh
from
the
distant
hills
blew
in
making
the
flame
dance
and
flicker
and
flaunting
a
corner
of
the
white
counterpane
gayly
in
the
air
beppina
leaned
her
arms
on
the
wide
stone
and
looked
out
over
florence
the
sun
had
just
risen
above
the
blue
crest
of
the
apennines
its
level
rays
tipping
the
campanile
and
the
great
dome
of
the
cathedral
with
light
and
turning
eastern
into
flaming
beacons
the
glowing
colour
of
the
sky
was
reflected
in
the
waters
of
the
arno
which
flowed
beneath
its
many
bridges
like
a
stream
of
molten
gold
pigeons
wheeled
and
circled
above
the
roofs
and
the
air
was
filled
with
gentle
croonings
and
the
whir
of
wings
for
a
moment
beppina
stood
drinking
in
the
freshness
of
the
lovely
spring
morning
then
stepping
softly
to
the
door
of
her
room
she
opened
it
cautiously
and
peered
into
the
dark
corridor
she
listened
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
house
except
the
gurgle
of
a
distant
snore
ah
that
teresina
murmured
beppina
to
herself
she
sleeps
like
a
kettle
boiling
first
the
lid
rattles
then
there
is
a
whistle
like
the
steam
why
does
she
not
put
corks
in
her
nose
at
night
and
shut
the
noise
up
inside
of
her
she
slipped
silently
into
the
hall
and
listened
at
the
door
of
room
she
heard
no
sound
and
was
just
on
the
point
of
turning
the
knob
when
the
door
flew
open
of
itself
and
a
boy
with
great
dark
eyes
like
her
own
burst
into
the
corridor
and
bumped
directly
into
her
beppina
backed
hastily
against
the
wall
and
though
the
breath
was
nearly
knocked
out
of
her
remembered
to
offer
him
her
easter
greetings
buona
pasqua
beppo
mio
she
gasped
i
was
just
going
to
wake
you
to
wake
me
beppo
shouted
derisively
that
a
good
joke
i
up
first
just
as
i
said
i
should
be
see
i
am
all
dressed
and
you
you
have
not
even
begun
beppina
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
hush
beppo
she
whispered
do
roar
so
it
only
five
and
every
one
else
in
the
house
is
asleep
not
even
the
maids
have
stirred
and
as
for
teresina
listen
to
her
she
sleeps
like
the
dead
though
less
quietly
yet
she
rouses
at
once
if
the
baby
stirs
and
if
we
should
wake
the
baby
at
this
hour
she
would
be
angry
at
us
all
day
long
they
listened
for
a
moment
to
the
appalling
sounds
which
rolled
forth
from
the
room
where
teresina
the
nurse
slept
then
beppo
said
if
the
baby
can
sleep
through
that
noise
she
can
sleep
through
anything
it
sounds
like
a
in
the
mountains
at
that
moment
a
wicked
idea
popped
into
his
head
i
know
what
going
to
do
he
whispered
grinning
with
delight
i
going
to
creep
into
her
room
like
a
cat
and
drop
something
into
her
mouth
she
sleeps
with
it
open
and
i
have
a
piece
of
soap
just
the
right
size
beppo
gasped
beppina
do
you
dare
teresina
would
then
refuse
to
take
us
to
the
piazza
and
you
know
very
well
there
is
no
one
else
to
go
with
us
for
the
governess
had
a
headache
last
night
and
went
to
bed
looking
as
yellow
as
saffron
oh
but
just
think
how
funny
teresina
would
look
choking
and
sputtering
like
a
volcano
pouring
forth
fire
smoke
and
lava
chuckled
beppo
who
was
studying
geography
and
liked
it
much
better
than
beppina
did
if
you
do
it
you
just
have
to
spend
easter
saturday
in
the
house
and
miss
all
the
fun
warned
beppina
mammina
would
not
let
us
go
with
any
of
the
other
servants
i
do
see
why
she
wo
let
us
go
alone
said
beppo
crossly
i
hate
to
go
out
on
the
street
with
teresina
all
dressed
up
in
her
ruff
and
streamers
so
people
will
know
she
a
baby
nurse
i
big
enough
to
go
by
myself
beppina
looked
despairingly
at
her
brother
oh
dear
she
said
i
wish
mammina
had
taken
us
with
her
to
the
villa
instead
of
leaving
us
to
go
later
with
teresina
and
the
governess
when
she
has
everything
ready
for
us
i
would
mind
missing
easter
saturday
here
if
only
we
could
be
up
at
the
villa
or
if
only
our
dear
babbo
had
not
had
to
go
away
to
rome
added
beppo
gloomily
he
would
have
taken
us
with
him
to
see
all
the
easter
sights
and
no
thanks
to
teresina
either
but
they
did
go
both
of
them
sighed
beppina
so
it
teresina
or
stay
at
home
for
us
and
i
sure
i
do
want
to
stay
at
home
beppo
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
hunched
up
his
shoulders
and
looked
so
gloomy
and
obstinate
that
beppina
saw
something
must
be
done
at
once
oh
pazienza
beppo
mio
she
said
giving
him
a
little
shake
it
might
be
worse
surely
come
let
go
down
to
the
garden
and
feed
the
pigeons
you
get
the
crumbs
while
i
dress
hurry
then
said
beppo
brightening
a
little
as
beppina
flung
him
a
butterfly
kiss
and
ran
back
to
her
room
she
threw
on
her
clothes
in
two
minutes
fastened
her
long
black
hair
with
a
and
appeared
again
in
the
corridor
just
as
beppo
returned
from
the
kitchen
with
a
pan
of
crumbs
in
his
hand
the
two
children
then
quietly
opened
the
door
which
led
from
the
grifoni
apartment
into
the
public
hall
of
the
old
palace
and
crept
silently
down
the
long
dark
stone
stairs
to
the
ground
floor
where
pietro
the
porter
lived
with
his
wife
and
six
children
pietro
opened
the
door
of
his
own
apartment
and
stepped
into
the
public
hall
just
as
the
two
dark
figures
came
stealthily
down
the
last
flight
beppo
was
certainly
in
a
mood
for
mischief
that
morning
for
when
he
saw
pietro
he
crept
softly
up
behind
him
as
he
was
buttoning
the
last
button
of
his
livery
and
suddenly
shouted
boom
right
in
his
ear
pietro
thought
it
was
one
of
his
own
children
who
had
played
this
saucy
trick
santa
maria
he
cried
wheeling
about
with
his
hands
out
to
catch
and
punish
the
offender
come
here
thou
thorn
in
the
eye
then
as
he
saw
the
children
of
the
marchese
grinning
at
him
out
of
the
shadows
his
hand
went
up
in
a
salute
instead
buona
pasqua
donna
beppina
he
cried
and
you
too
don
beppo
why
are
you
about
at
this
hour
in
the
morning
scaring
honest
people
out
of
their
wits
buona
pasqua
pietro
laughed
the
twins
we
are
going
out
in
the
garden
and
we
want
you
to
open
the
door
for
us
no
one
but
the
gardener
and
the
members
of
the
grifoni
family
ever
went
into
the
garden
which
lay
at
the
back
of
the
palace
for
the
tenants
who
occupied
other
portions
of
the
ancient
building
were
not
allowed
to
use
it
and
the
marchese
grifoni
lived
in
florence
only
during
the
winter
months
the
rest
of
the
year
and
the
children
thought
much
the
best
part
of
it
was
spent
in
their
beautiful
villa
in
the
hills
near
padua
pietro
selected
a
key
from
the
jingling
bunch
which
he
carried
at
his
belt
and
opened
the
old
carved
door
it
was
a
charming
sight
which
greeted
their
eyes
as
the
door
swung
back
on
its
rusty
hinges
the
garden
was
small
with
a
high
wall
all
about
it
over
which
ivy
spread
a
mantle
of
green
in
the
middle
of
the
space
a
fountain
splashed
and
bubbled
and
the
garden
borders
were
gay
with
yellow
daffodils
blue
chicory
and
white
florentine
lilies
there
were
other
delights
also
in
the
grifoni
garden
for
in
the
fountain
lived
garibaldi
a
turtle
of
great
age
and
dignity
and
in
the
chinks
of
the
walls
were
lizards
which
liked
nothing
better
than
to
be
tickled
with
straws
as
they
lay
basking
in
the
sunshine
the
moment
the
children
appeared
a
cloud
of
pigeons
swept
down
from
the
neighbouring
roofs
and
begged
for
food
beppina
held
a
piece
of
bread
between
her
lips
and
a
fat
pigeon
with
glistening
purple
feathers
on
his
breast
instantly
lit
upon
her
shoulder
he
was
followed
by
another
and
another
until
she
flung
up
her
arms
and
sent
them
all
skyward
in
a
whirl
of
wings
only
to
return
again
a
moment
later
to
peck
the
morsel
from
her
lips
as
she
was
playing
in
this
way
with
the
pigeons
she
chanced
to
glance
up
at
the
windows
of
the
porter
rooms
which
overlooked
the
garden
there
gazing
wistfully
out
at
them
were
six
pairs
of
eyes
belonging
to
pietro
six
children
beppina
waved
her
hand
at
them
come
out
she
cried
gayly
and
wild
with
delight
at
such
an
privilege
the
six
came
scrambling
into
the
garden
at
once
there
the
eight
children
played
with
the
pigeons
in
the
sunshine
until
in
an
unlucky
moment
pietro
youngest
baby
fell
into
the
fountain
and
was
rescued
screaming
with
fright
by
beppina
who
got
her
own
dress
quite
wet
in
the
process
it
was
at
this
very
moment
as
luck
would
have
it
that
teresina
appeared
in
the
doorway
her
ruffled
cap
bristling
and
her
hands
upheld
in
horror
at
finding
the
children
of
the
marchese
grifoni
playing
in
the
sacred
palace
garden
with
the
dirty
little
children
of
the
family
i
have
been
looking
everywhere
for
you
she
said
with
freezing
dignity
the
priest
will
soon
be
here
to
bless
the
house
and
you
signorina
are
not
half
dressed
and
besides
you
are
as
wet
as
if
you
had
been
swimming
in
the
fountain
what
would
the
signora
say
if
she
could
see
you
now
she
glared
at
the
six
children
of
pietro
as
she
spoke
and
they
instantly
scuttled
back
into
their
own
quarters
like
mice
who
had
seen
the
cat
then
she
thumped
majestically
upstairs
the
children
prepared
to
follow
but
all
the
brightness
had
gone
out
of
the
morning
and
they
went
slowly
and
sullenly
though
teresina
had
a
good
heart
she
had
a
sharp
tongue
and
the
twins
had
some
reason
for
not
loving
her
it
was
now
six
months
since
she
had
first
appeared
before
them
carrying
a
little
red
wrinkled
baby
on
a
pillow
and
had
told
them
that
it
was
their
little
new
sister
and
that
now
the
signora
their
mother
would
love
the
baby
much
better
than
she
loved
them
and
she
had
laughed
when
she
said
it
yes
believe
it
or
not
she
had
laughed
teresina
is
always
spoiling
things
said
beppo
kicking
his
feet
against
each
step
as
he
began
to
climb
the
stairs
che
che
said
beppina
which
is
italian
for
tut
tut
after
all
it
is
quite
true
that
we
must
be
ready
for
the
priest
what
would
mammina
say
if
she
knew
we
were
wet
and
dirty
when
he
came
beppo
face
broke
suddenly
into
a
beaming
smile
i
know
what
do
he
cried
and
disappeared
into
the
garden
again
in
a
moment
he
came
back
carrying
some
water
from
the
fountain
in
an
old
and
went
bounding
upstairs
two
steps
at
a
time
slopping
it
all
the
way
beppina
followed
breathlessly
and
reached
the
top
step
just
in
time
to
see
that
bad
boy
give
a
vigorous
pull
at
the
bell
there
was
a
scrambling
sound
within
before
the
door
was
thrown
open
by
teresina
who
supposing
it
to
be
the
priest
had
instantly
called
the
other
servants
and
flopped
down
upon
her
knees
to
receive
his
blessing
and
the
sprinkling
of
holy
water
which
always
accompanied
it
behind
teresina
knelt
maria
the
cook
and
antonia
the
with
their
hands
clasped
and
their
heads
reverently
bent
and
it
was
only
when
they
had
all
received
a
generous
dose
of
water
which
was
not
at
all
holy
that
they
raised
their
heads
and
saw
the
grinning
face
of
beppo
and
the
empty
in
his
hand
teresina
started
wrathfully
to
her
feet
and
if
the
real
priest
had
not
been
heard
coming
up
the
stairs
at
that
moment
things
might
have
gone
badly
with
beppo
as
it
was
the
real
priest
followed
the
bogus
one
so
quickly
that
there
was
just
time
for
the
children
to
slip
to
their
knees
before
padre
ugo
who
was
short
fat
and
breathless
entered
followed
by
an
acolyte
carrying
the
vessel
of
holy
water
padre
ugo
was
in
a
tremendous
hurry
for
he
had
many
other
places
to
visit
that
morning
he
fairly
ran
through
the
rooms
sprinkling
each
with
a
dash
of
holy
water
mumbling
a
prayer
and
raising
his
hand
in
blessing
then
racing
on
to
the
next
with
all
the
household
trailing
behind
him
like
the
tail
of
a
kite
he
blessed
the
kitchen
and
pantries
he
even
blessed
the
cat
which
was
washing
her
face
by
the
kitchen
range
not
being
a
religious
cat
she
put
up
her
tail
and
fled
into
the
where
she
stayed
until
the
priest
had
gone
the
only
room
in
the
whole
house
to
be
missed
was
the
one
occupied
by
the
governess
that
poor
lady
had
locked
herself
in
with
her
headache
and
she
was
a
protestant
besides
so
that
room
had
to
go
unblessed
the
whole
year
through
when
padre
ugo
had
gone
teresina
was
obliged
to
give
her
whole
attention
to
the
baby
and
it
was
not
until
she
and
the
twins
were
ready
for
the
street
that
at
last
she
said
stiffly
to
beppo
morning
don
beppo
you
will
find
that
the
hares
have
left
no
easter
eggs
in
the
garden
for
such
a
naughty
boy
as
you
chapter
two
in
the
piazza
the
clock
in
the
reception
hall
had
already
struck
eleven
when
the
two
children
dressed
in
their
best
followed
by
teresina
passed
out
beneath
the
carved
stone
arch
of
the
palace
door
into
the
streets
of
florence
their
way
lay
through
the
edge
of
the
beautiful
boboli
gardens
where
lilacs
bloomed
and
birds
were
singing
as
they
built
their
nests
past
churches
and
palaces
across
the
ponte
vecchio
one
of
the
oldest
of
all
the
old
bridges
across
the
arno
and
then
on
through
narrow
streets
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
it
was
nearly
noon
when
at
last
they
reached
the
piazza
del
duomo
the
square
was
a
wonderful
sight
on
that
beautiful
spring
morning
there
in
front
of
them
rose
the
great
cathedral
with
its
mighty
dome
and
beside
it
stood
the
which
beppina
had
watched
from
her
window
in
the
dawn
here
also
in
the
square
was
the
old
baptistery
bel
san
where
beppo
and
beppina
and
all
the
other
children
in
florence
had
been
baptised
when
they
were
babies
from
all
the
side
streets
entering
the
piazza
there
poured
streams
of
people
until
it
seemed
as
if
everybody
in
the
world
must
be
there
in
that
great
crowd
there
were
peasants
leading
donkeys
with
bells
jingling
from
their
scarlet
trappings
there
were
carts
filled
with
babies
and
women
whose
only
was
their
own
sleek
black
braids
there
were
farmers
and
peddlers
noblemen
and
beggars
great
ladies
and
gypsies
monks
and
tourists
brothers
of
the
misericordia
and
old
people
and
young
rich
and
poor
every
one
eager
for
the
great
easter
spectacle
to
begin
teresina
found
a
place
for
the
children
and
herself
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
and
almost
at
once
there
appeared
right
before
their
eyes
a
great
black
car
drawn
by
four
splendid
white
oxen
all
garlanded
with
flowers
this
strange
black
car
stopped
directly
in
front
of
the
cathedral
then
from
the
open
door
of
the
baptistery
came
a
solemn
procession
headed
by
the
archbishop
bearing
a
brazier
filled
with
sacred
fire
the
procession
disappeared
within
the
cathedral
doors
and
there
was
a
moment
of
breathless
silence
both
within
the
church
and
without
as
the
archbishop
lighted
the
candles
on
the
high
altar
from
the
holy
fire
the
instant
the
candles
flamed
the
choir
burst
forth
in
a
great
swelling
chorus
glory
to
god
in
the
highest
they
sang
and
the
bells
in
the
campanile
began
to
ring
as
if
they
had
suddenly
gone
mad
then
the
wonderful
thing
happened
for
which
every
one
had
been
waiting
out
of
the
door
of
the
cathedral
high
above
the
heads
of
the
people
there
flashed
a
white
dove
it
sped
along
a
wire
to
the
great
black
car
and
the
instant
it
touched
it
there
was
a
terrific
bang
then
another
and
another
as
hissing
rockets
tore
their
way
into
the
sky
the
whole
car
seemed
to
blow
up
in
a
joyful
burst
of
sound
look
look
the
colombina
shouted
the
people
and
as
the
mechanical
dove
returned
along
its
wire
to
the
altar
the
air
was
filled
with
shouts
of
christ
is
risen
buona
pasqua
buona
pasqua
from
a
thousand
throats
the
bells
of
the
campanile
clashed
and
sang
overhead
waking
all
the
bells
in
florence
and
in
the
hills
for
miles
around
so
that
with
the
singing
and
the
ringing
there
was
never
a
more
joyful
noise
made
than
was
heard
in
the
piazza
del
duomo
on
that
easter
saturday
in
florence
teresina
and
the
children
shouting
like
the
others
had
just
turned
with
the
crowd
to
follow
the
car
as
it
moved
away
from
the
cathedral
doors
when
suddenly
teresina
gave
a
shriek
of
joy
and
dropping
their
hands
rushed
to
the
side
of
a
cart
which
was
standing
beside
the
curb
in
one
of
the
streets
opening
into
the
square
it
is
not
surprising
that
she
forgot
the
children
for
a
moment
for
there
in
the
cart
sat
her
mother
holding
in
her
arms
teresina
own
baby
which
she
had
left
at
home
in
order
to
take
care
of
the
baby
of
the
marchesa
moreover
beside
the
cart
was
teresina
husband
and
in
it
there
were
also
her
little
brothers
and
sisters
the
twins
thus
suddenly
loosed
from
teresina
grasp
were
swept
along
by
the
crowd
and
when
a
few
moments
later
she
turned
to
look
for
them
they
were
no
longer
in
sight
beppina
clutched
beppo
arm
as
they
were
pushed
along
by
a
fat
man
behind
them
we
must
find
teresina
she
shouted
in
his
ear
we
ca
get
back
beppo
shouted
in
reply
punching
the
fat
man
in
the
stomach
with
his
elbow
and
pulling
beppina
closer
to
his
side
and
besides
he
went
on
in
a
lower
key
i
glad
to
get
away
from
her
we
have
a
good
time
by
ourselves
and
go
home
when
we
get
ready
without
being
followed
around
by
a
nurse
like
two
babies
what
will
mammina
say
gasped
beppina
she
is
here
so
she
wo
say
anything
at
all
said
naughty
beppo
then
he
added
with
an
important
wag
of
his
head
just
you
stick
by
me
i
take
care
of
you
beppina
had
her
doubts
but
she
considered
beppo
the
most
remarkable
boy
in
the
world
so
she
trotted
obediently
along
with
her
hand
in
his
sure
that
he
was
equal
to
any
situation
that
might
arise
for
an
hour
or
more
the
two
children
wandered
about
the
piazza
carried
hither
and
thither
in
the
wake
of
the
crowds
first
they
followed
the
misericordia
brothers
as
they
bore
away
to
the
hospital
a
sick
old
man
who
had
fallen
in
the
street
then
they
found
a
marionette
show
and
stood
entranced
for
a
long
time
before
it
watching
the
thrilling
adventures
of
pantalone
after
that
they
crept
into
the
dim
cathedral
now
nearly
empty
of
people
and
watched
the
women
who
came
to
light
their
tapers
at
the
great
paschal
candle
beside
the
altar
it
was
then
that
they
discovered
they
were
hungry
and
going
out
on
the
street
they
refreshed
themselves
with
oranges
bought
of
a
if
teresina
could
have
seen
the
children
of
the
marchesa
as
they
stood
sucking
oranges
in
the
public
street
it
is
likely
she
might
have
fainted
with
horror
and
been
carried
away
to
the
hospital
by
the
brothers
of
mercy
in
her
turn
but
as
it
was
teresina
was
not
there
to
see
after
searching
the
crowds
distractedly
for
an
hour
she
had
rushed
back
to
the
palace
hoping
to
find
the
twins
there
before
her
and
turning
the
whole
establishment
into
an
uproar
when
she
found
they
had
not
yet
appeared
meanwhile
the
children
unconscious
of
time
were
wandering
about
enjoying
their
new
freedom
and
growing
more
adventurous
at
every
step
though
they
had
finished
their
oranges
they
were
still
hungry
and
there
was
a
wonderful
smell
of
roasting
chicken
in
the
air
which
beppo
followed
with
the
unerring
instinct
of
a
hungry
boy
and
soon
the
two
children
were
standing
before
an
open
in
a
side
street
gnawing
chicken
bones
and
smacking
their
lips
with
as
much
gusto
as
if
they
had
been
bred
in
the
streets
instead
of
a
palace
when
they
left
the
with
its
rows
of
bright
copper
pots
and
pans
and
its
delicious
smells
beppo
had
only
a
few
soldi
left
in
his
pockets
and
as
for
beppina
there
had
been
nothing
but
a
handkerchief
in
hers
from
the
beginning
avanti
cried
beppo
made
more
bold
than
ever
by
the
courage
which
comes
with
a
full
stomach
let
explore
and
seizing
the
hand
of
the
more
timid
beppina
he
ventured
farther
and
farther
up
the
narrow
street
they
had
never
been
in
this
part
of
the
city
before
in
their
lives
they
had
never
even
dreamed
that
people
could
live
in
such
dark
dirty
houses
more
like
than
homes
for
human
beings
and
on
streets
so
narrow
that
beppo
could
easily
leap
across
them
in
one
jump
they
made
their
way
through
groups
of
idle
loungers
stepping
cautiously
around
dirty
babies
playing
in
the
gutters
and
past
slatternly
mothers
gossiping
in
shrill
tones
from
doorsteps
and
open
windows
quite
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
every
one
turned
to
look
with
astonishment
at
the
strange
spectacle
of
two
children
walking
alone
through
the
streets
of
old
florence
at
the
opening
of
a
dark
passage
they
almost
stumbled
over
an
old
woman
bent
over
a
where
she
was
roasting
chestnuts
she
looks
just
like
a
witch
whispered
beppina
making
the
horns
with
her
fingers
to
protect
herself
from
the
evil
eye
hurry
past
they
shrank
back
against
the
opposite
wall
of
the
narrow
passage
and
tried
to
squeeze
by
but
the
old
woman
swept
out
a
bony
hand
and
seized
beppina
by
the
skirt
for
the
love
of
santa
maria
just
a
few
soldi
my
pretty
little
lady
she
whined
pulling
the
child
toward
her
her
smile
was
so
terrifying
that
beppina
gave
a
little
scream
and
with
beppo
help
tore
herself
free
of
the
old
woman
grasp
then
the
two
fled
still
farther
up
the
street
followed
by
a
storm
of
abuse
and
the
laughter
of
the
idle
people
they
passed
in
their
flight
when
at
last
they
paused
for
breath
they
found
themselves
in
a
labyrinth
of
narrow
alleys
with
no
idea
of
which
way
to
turn
to
get
back
to
the
piazza
beppina
was
frightened
but
beppo
said
confidently
all
we
got
to
do
is
to
keep
on
going
and
we
are
sure
to
strike
either
the
piazza
or
the
river
and
we
shall
know
how
to
get
home
from
either
one
so
do
you
be
afraid
inspired
by
his
boldness
beppina
followed
him
from
one
narrow
passage
to
another
until
at
last
the
streets
began
to
widen
again
and
they
saw
before
them
an
open
square
and
heard
the
sound
of
music
they
ran
joyously
forward
and
found
themselves
in
a
beautiful
but
strange
piazza
with
a
great
fountain
playing
in
the
centre
and
fine
old
buildings
surrounding
it
on
all
sides
the
source
of
the
music
was
hidden
by
a
throng
of
people
gathered
together
near
the
fountain
it
a
cried
beppo
eagerly
maybe
there
a
monkey
and
he
dashed
into
the
midst
of
the
crowd
beppina
followed
close
behind
and
the
two
worked
their
way
under
the
elbows
of
the
grown
people
until
they
reached
the
very
centre
where
they
were
thrilled
to
find
a
dark
swarthy
man
holding
a
bear
by
a
rope
the
bear
was
dancing
clumsily
on
his
hind
legs
and
near
by
a
woman
with
black
eyes
and
hair
and
great
rings
in
her
ears
was
grinding
an
organ
on
top
of
the
organ
sat
a
monkey
in
a
red
cap
shaking
a
tambourine
behind
the
group
stood
a
yellow
van
drawn
by
two
donkeys
gayly
tricked
out
with
scarlet
nets
and
jingling
bells
the
twins
had
no
sooner
arrived
upon
the
scene
than
the
music
stopped
the
bear
dropped
upon
all
fours
and
the
monkey
hopping
down
from
the
organ
began
to
leap
about
among
the
people
holding
out
the
tambourine
for
money
then
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
rapidly
the
crowd
melted
away
in
a
few
moments
the
children
were
the
only
ones
left
beppo
gave
his
last
coin
to
the
monkey
and
the
woman
throwing
a
black
look
after
the
disappearing
crowd
ground
out
another
tune
for
them
on
the
organ
while
the
monkey
to
beppo
great
delight
leaped
upon
his
shoulder
and
searched
his
pockets
with
her
little
black
paws
the
man
meanwhile
was
preparing
to
start
away
he
handed
the
rope
to
his
wife
and
climbing
to
the
driver
seat
of
the
van
cracked
his
whip
and
shouted
aiou
aiou
you
laggards
to
the
donkeys
the
monkey
leaped
from
beppo
shoulder
to
the
back
of
the
bear
and
as
the
caravan
began
to
move
turned
somersaults
on
the
bear
back
with
such
wonderful
agility
that
no
boy
on
earth
could
have
resisted
following
her
the
woman
said
something
to
her
husband
which
the
children
did
not
understand
though
they
did
not
know
that
it
was
because
she
spoke
to
him
in
the
venetian
dialect
then
she
turned
to
beppo
and
said
with
an
insinuating
smile
where
is
it
that
the
signore
lives
now
here
was
a
woman
of
sense
she
called
him
signore
as
if
he
were
already
a
grown
man
beppo
swelled
with
satisfaction
and
answered
promptly
in
the
palace
grifoni
across
the
river
si
si
said
the
woman
which
in
italian
means
yes
yes
we
are
going
in
that
direction
would
you
not
like
to
go
with
us
and
lead
the
bear
oh
if
teresina
could
have
heard
that
here
were
people
who
thought
him
quite
big
enough
to
lead
a
live
bear
while
she
and
mammina
too
for
that
matter
thought
he
still
should
be
followed
by
a
nurse
beppo
leaped
boldly
forward
though
beppina
tried
to
hold
him
back
and
seizing
the
bear
rope
marched
proudly
along
behind
the
van
the
woman
laughed
and
clapped
her
hands
bravo
bravo
she
cried
then
turning
to
the
beppina
she
said
comfortingly
the
old
ugolone
will
not
hurt
him
he
is
very
old
and
as
tame
as
a
kitten
see
she
gave
the
bear
a
slap
and
walked
along
beside
him
with
her
hand
on
his
back
and
beppina
could
do
nothing
but
follow
for
some
time
they
trailed
the
van
in
this
way
together
with
a
small
army
of
boys
and
girls
who
were
consumed
with
envy
for
beppo
and
hoped
they
too
might
be
allowed
a
turn
at
leading
the
bear
one
by
one
they
had
dropped
away
and
returned
to
their
homes
before
the
twins
realised
that
the
afternoon
was
nearly
spent
and
night
was
approaching
we
must
go
home
now
please
said
beppina
politely
to
the
woman
si
si
said
the
woman
nodding
her
head
and
smiling
more
than
ever
we
shall
soon
see
the
river
this
assurance
quieted
beppina
for
a
time
and
she
trudged
patiently
along
until
they
reached
the
very
outskirts
of
the
city
and
still
no
bridge
and
no
river
had
appeared
not
beppina
only
but
beppo
too
now
began
to
be
alarmed
where
were
they
going
oh
if
only
the
grey
walls
of
the
grifoni
palace
would
rise
before
them
beppo
even
began
to
modify
his
opinion
about
teresina
her
ruff
and
streamers
would
have
been
as
welcome
a
sight
to
him
just
then
as
an
oasis
to
travellers
in
the
desert
but
alas
teresina
was
at
that
moment
many
miles
away
and
distracted
with
anxiety
and
grief
the
bewildered
beppina
now
began
to
cry
come
my
pretty
said
the
woman
in
a
wheedling
tone
you
are
tired
is
it
not
so
you
shall
rest
the
weary
legs
her
voice
was
soft
but
she
seized
beppina
with
a
grip
of
steel
and
swung
her
up
into
the
back
of
the
moving
van
you
too
my
brave
one
she
went
on
taking
the
bear
rope
from
beppo
hand
and
tying
it
to
a
ring
in
the
back
of
the
cart
up
you
go
she
gave
him
a
shove
as
he
scrambled
up
beside
beppina
and
then
tossing
the
monkey
in
after
him
swung
herself
up
beside
the
children
the
road
now
began
to
ascend
and
the
twins
with
growing
terror
watched
the
sun
sink
lower
and
lower
behind
the
dome
of
the
cathedral
which
they
could
see
in
the
distance
beppina
shook
with
sobs
and
beppo
sat
pale
and
frightened
as
the
tower
and
the
dome
the
only
landmarks
they
knew
in
florence
grew
darker
and
darker
against
the
sunset
sky
do
not
cry
madonna
mia
said
the
woman
giving
beppina
a
little
shake
you
have
missed
your
way
but
what
of
that
you
are
safe
with
us
if
you
have
money
in
your
pockets
you
might
possibly
find
your
way
home
even
yet
though
it
is
nearly
dark
and
it
is
very
dangerous
for
children
to
go
about
alone
but
we
have
any
money
said
beppo
i
gave
all
i
had
to
the
monkey
ah
said
the
woman
that
is
bad
to
go
back
without
money
you
would
spend
the
night
in
the
streets
without
doubt
or
possibly
in
the
jail
if
the
police
found
you
they
would
take
you
for
vagrants
it
would
be
terrible
indeed
if
the
police
should
get
you
still
if
you
think
best
you
can
jump
down
and
start
back
right
now
i
do
not
believe
the
bear
would
hurt
you
even
though
he
does
not
like
to
have
any
one
jump
right
in
front
of
him
the
children
looked
down
at
ugolone
lumbering
along
behind
the
van
if
they
jumped
it
must
be
almost
on
top
of
him
and
in
the
darkness
he
looked
as
big
as
a
house
and
very
alarming
even
beppo
lost
his
swagger
and
as
for
beppina
she
was
speechless
with
terror
the
woman
continued
to
cajole
them
soon
we
shall
camp
beside
the
road
for
the
night
she
said
and
you
shall
have
something
hot
for
your
supper
and
sleep
in
the
van
as
cozy
as
birds
in
a
nest
that
is
surely
much
better
than
the
jail
and
oh
la
bella
vita
just
think
you
shall
grind
the
organ
and
play
with
carina
all
day
long
and
there
will
be
no
lessons
there
was
no
response
to
this
alluring
prospect
the
children
homesick
weary
clung
to
each
other
in
the
darkness
and
shrank
as
far
as
possible
from
the
woman
whom
they
now
saw
to
be
not
their
friend
but
their
jailer
on
and
on
through
the
deepening
darkness
lumbered
the
yellow
van
until
it
seemed
to
the
unhappy
children
that
it
must
be
nearly
morning
at
last
however
the
team
turned
from
the
highroad
and
stopped
beside
a
little
stream
the
woman
sprang
out
and
while
her
husband
unharnessed
the
donkeys
and
tied
ugolone
to
a
tree
for
the
night
she
built
a
fire
and
hung
a
kettle
over
it
she
put
the
monkey
in
beppina
arms
and
sent
beppo
for
water
from
the
stream
and
to
gather
sticks
for
the
fire
soon
a
kettleful
of
steaming
mush
was
ready
and
the
woman
whose
name
was
carlotta
called
luigi
her
husband
and
giving
the
children
each
a
tin
dish
bade
them
eat
their
supper
even
if
it
had
been
her
favourite
food
beppina
could
not
have
swallowed
a
mouthful
that
night
but
beppo
though
he
too
was
homesick
could
still
eat
even
though
nothing
better
than
polenta
was
offered
him
he
sat
down
with
carlotta
and
luigi
before
the
fire
on
the
ground
while
beppina
stayed
in
the
back
of
the
van
hugging
the
monkey
to
her
lonely
heart
and
striving
to
keep
back
the
tears
the
flickering
flames
lit
up
the
trunks
of
the
trees
making
them
stand
out
like
sentinels
against
the
velvet
darkness
of
the
woods
beyond
and
sending
dancing
shadows
of
the
bear
and
the
donkeys
far
across
the
murmuring
stream
the
moon
looked
down
through
the
and
the
nightingales
sang
plaintively
in
the
shadows
after
supper
while
luigi
sat
smoking
his
pipe
by
the
fire
carlotta
threw
a
heap
of
straw
into
one
corner
of
the
van
and
said
to
the
children
come
hither
my
poverelli
here
is
a
soft
bed
for
you
lie
down
and
sleep
too
tired
to
do
anything
else
if
indeed
there
had
been
anything
else
in
the
world
for
them
to
do
the
children
obeyed
and
clasped
in
each
other
arms
soon
fell
asleep
with
sorrow
and
fatigue
chapter
three
in
the
mountains
they
were
awakened
next
morning
by
the
chattering
of
the
monkey
and
looking
out
from
their
corner
they
could
not
for
a
moment
remember
where
they
were
or
how
they
came
to
be
there
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
the
birds
were
singing
and
carlotta
was
up
and
stirring
something
in
a
pot
over
the
fire
luigi
had
gone
with
the
donkeys
to
give
them
a
drink
and
ugolone
was
standing
on
his
hind
legs
beside
his
tree
grunting
impatiently
for
his
breakfast
beppina
gazed
at
the
strange
scene
for
one
blank
moment
then
as
memory
came
back
she
buried
her
head
in
the
straw
and
sobbed
beppo
tried
to
comfort
her
do
cry
beppinella
he
whispered
we
shall
find
some
way
of
returning
to
florence
i
feel
sure
of
it
it
might
be
worse
pazienza
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
just
then
carlotta
hearing
the
muffled
sobs
and
the
murmur
of
his
voice
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
van
come
out
little
lost
ones
she
called
to
them
the
sun
shines
and
we
shall
have
a
fine
day
in
the
mountains
see
here
is
carina
waiting
to
greet
you
she
tossed
the
monkey
toward
them
as
she
spoke
and
disappeared
around
the
end
of
the
van
soon
she
returned
carrying
in
her
hand
a
green
blouse
and
a
gay
striped
skirt
here
she
said
to
beppina
i
will
lend
these
to
you
then
you
can
save
your
pretty
clothes
so
they
will
be
clean
to
wear
when
you
return
to
your
mammina
she
spoke
so
confidently
of
their
return
that
beppina
thought
perhaps
the
woman
meant
to
take
them
back
that
very
day
she
reluctantly
put
on
the
queer
blouse
and
the
striped
skirt
while
beppo
arrayed
himself
in
a
pair
of
velveteen
trousers
which
were
as
much
too
long
for
him
as
the
skirt
was
for
beppina
carlotta
had
brought
these
also
and
she
gave
him
a
red
sash
to
bind
around
his
waist
as
well
when
they
were
equipped
in
these
garments
the
two
children
gazed
at
each
other
in
dismay
you
do
look
like
beppo
at
all
you
look
just
like
a
bandit
said
beppina
and
you
you
look
like
a
gypsy
girl
gasped
beppo
even
mammina
would
know
us
if
she
were
to
see
us
now
beppina
whispered
despairingly
that
just
why
that
woman
did
it
gasped
beppo
with
sudden
illumination
she
does
care
a
bit
about
saving
our
clothes
she
wants
to
disguise
us
so
people
will
think
we
belong
to
them
oh
dear
shuddered
beppina
let
change
back
again
they
seized
their
clothes
but
just
then
they
saw
carlotta
glittering
black
eyes
gazing
in
at
them
from
the
end
of
the
van
it
was
as
if
she
knew
their
very
thoughts
avanti
avanti
she
called
is
it
that
you
are
lazy
come
we
must
be
on
the
road
not
daring
to
linger
or
protest
the
two
strange
little
figures
came
tumbling
out
of
the
straw
at
once
and
after
washing
in
the
brook
sat
down
on
a
fallen
log
to
eat
their
breakfast
carina
perched
beside
them
on
the
log
and
when
she
had
finished
her
own
portion
leaped
on
ugolone
back
and
leaning
down
snatched
away
some
of
his
breakfast
from
under
his
nose
in
vain
poor
old
ugolone
growled
and
slapped
at
her
with
his
clumsy
paws
he
was
always
too
slow
to
catch
her
the
children
were
so
absorbed
in
watching
this
drama
that
they
did
not
notice
what
carlotta
was
doing
meanwhile
but
later
when
they
looked
for
their
own
clothes
again
they
had
mysteriously
disappeared
and
were
not
seen
again
when
they
had
finished
breakfast
carlotta
called
to
beppina
come
here
poverina
your
hair
is
full
of
straw
i
will
fix
it
for
you
beppina
obeyed
and
the
woman
coaxed
her
tangled
locks
into
place
combing
them
with
her
fingers
and
at
last
succeeded
in
plaiting
them
into
a
number
of
tight
braids
which
she
wound
about
her
head
there
said
she
when
this
was
done
now
you
will
no
longer
need
your
hat
but
said
beppina
i
want
my
hat
only
peasants
go
the
woman
gave
a
short
laugh
and
her
teeth
gleamed
so
white
between
her
lips
that
beppina
thought
of
the
wolf
who
tried
to
pass
himself
off
for
red
riding
hood
grandmother
do
as
you
are
told
said
carlotta
she
smiled
as
she
said
it
but
there
was
such
a
fierce
look
in
her
face
that
beppina
made
the
sign
against
the
evil
eye
with
her
hand
behind
her
and
submitted
silently
as
carlotta
tied
a
red
kerchief
over
the
braids
these
preparations
completed
the
caravan
moved
on
with
luigi
as
usual
in
the
seat
carlotta
leading
the
bear
and
the
twins
carrying
the
monkey
bringing
up
the
rear
on
and
on
they
travelled
but
in
which
direction
the
children
could
only
guess
there
were
many
turns
in
the
road
which
wound
constantly
upward
and
with
every
mile
the
country
grew
more
wild
through
openings
between
the
hills
they
caught
fleeting
glimpses
of
quaint
villages
clinging
to
the
and
of
ancient
castles
commanding
beautiful
views
across
fertile
valleys
at
one
time
they
saw
the
roofs
of
a
great
stone
monastery
hidden
away
among
olive
trees
they
heard
the
music
of
its
bells
and
caught
faint
echoes
of
the
chanting
of
the
monks
it
was
then
that
they
remembered
that
it
was
easter
sunday
if
we
were
at
home
we
should
now
be
hunting
easter
eggs
and
sugar
lambs
in
the
garden
whispered
beppina
teresina
said
there
would
be
any
there
anyway
beppo
answered
winking
very
hard
and
then
neither
one
said
anything
for
a
long
time
all
day
long
the
donkeys
plodded
up
the
steep
slopes
only
stopping
by
the
wayside
for
rest
and
food
at
noon
it
was
evident
that
luigi
thought
best
to
keep
to
the
mountain
ways
so
all
through
the
sunny
hours
the
sad
little
travellers
walked
behind
the
van
or
climbed
inside
to
rest
their
weary
feet
not
knowing
where
they
were
going
and
not
daring
to
ask
at
sunset
they
reached
the
crest
of
a
high
hill
and
looking
back
they
could
see
far
far
away
in
the
purple
distance
the
twinkling
lights
of
the
city
of
florence
looking
like
a
sky
full
of
stars
fallen
to
earth
on
the
slopes
of
nearer
hills
there
were
other
twinkling
lights
like
chains
of
jewels
winding
in
and
out
among
the
trees
the
mountain
villages
were
celebrating
the
easter
festival
with
processions
and
with
singing
the
words
of
the
easter
song
floated
across
the
blue
spaces
the
royal
banners
forward
go
came
the
faint
chant
and
mingling
with
the
vesper
song
of
thrush
and
nightingale
lulled
the
tired
travellers
to
dreamless
sleep
chapter
four
they
learn
to
dance
it
was
cold
in
the
mountains
and
the
children
shivered
as
carlotta
routed
them
out
in
the
early
dawn
of
the
next
morning
come
she
said
crossly
as
she
set
up
the
forked
sticks
for
the
kettle
bestir
yourselves
lazy
ones
we
are
poor
people
do
you
think
we
can
afford
to
feed
you
and
wait
upon
you
like
servants
besides
there
must
be
no
more
snivelling
and
whining
beppo
take
the
pail
and
fetch
water
you
beppina
gather
sticks
for
the
fire
her
wheedling
manner
was
now
quite
gone
instead
she
gave
her
orders
with
such
a
threatening
look
that
the
children
trembled
with
fear
as
they
hastened
to
obey
at
a
little
distance
from
the
spot
where
they
were
encamped
a
stream
fed
by
a
mountain
spring
gushed
forth
from
a
pile
of
rocks
and
beppo
seizing
the
pail
plunged
into
the
dark
pine
woods
to
find
it
beppina
followed
and
the
instant
they
found
themselves
alone
in
the
forest
the
two
hid
behind
a
tree
and
held
a
hurried
consultation
listen
cocca
mia
whispered
beppo
i
have
thought
this
all
out
they
do
not
mean
to
take
us
back
ever
they
will
keep
us
like
slaves
to
work
for
them
if
we
want
to
see
our
home
again
we
must
obey
everything
they
say
no
matter
how
hard
then
some
day
when
they
are
watching
we
will
run
away
only
not
in
these
mountains
we
should
only
die
of
hunger
and
be
eaten
by
the
wolves
beppina
shuddered
oh
beppo
she
sobbed
there
is
a
lump
in
my
throat
as
big
as
an
egg
i
can
not
swallow
it
when
i
think
of
mammina
it
seems
to
me
i
shall
die
beppo
gave
her
a
little
shake
but
you
be
brave
he
said
every
day
we
will
have
a
word
together
and
soon
our
chance
will
come
i
try
beppo
said
beppina
gulping
down
her
sobs
good
girl
said
beppo
patting
her
approvingly
though
his
own
lips
trembled
and
his
voice
shook
do
you
remember
how
it
is
in
the
fairy
tales
the
prince
kills
the
giants
and
dragons
if
only
he
is
afraid
even
if
he
has
to
pass
through
enchanted
forests
beppina
looked
fearfully
over
her
shoulder
oh
beppo
she
gasped
i
did
think
of
it
before
but
now
i
sure
this
an
enchanted
forest
and
carlotta
is
a
witch
woman
we
must
pray
always
to
the
holy
virgin
to
protect
us
promise
me
you
will
i
promise
said
beppo
solemnly
and
do
you
forget
about
the
prince
either
just
then
they
heard
carlotta
voice
shouting
at
them
and
leaping
apart
they
fled
to
do
their
errands
when
breakfast
had
been
eaten
and
the
animals
fed
luigi
lit
his
pipe
and
stretched
out
on
the
ground
beside
the
fire
with
the
monkey
beside
him
here
we
stay
a
little
he
said
ugolone
lies
there
like
one
dead
the
donkeys
are
tired
and
so
am
i
we
have
come
thirty
miles
from
florence
ecco
said
carlotta
then
there
is
time
for
bean
soup
she
sent
beppo
for
more
water
and
when
the
kettle
was
bubbling
on
the
fire
called
the
children
to
her
side
tell
me
she
said
can
you
dance
a
little
quavered
beppina
dance
then
said
the
woman
beppina
reluctantly
seized
her
skirts
and
making
a
bow
took
a
few
dainty
steps
and
tripped
over
a
stone
carlotta
laughed
contemptuously
santa
maria
she
said
you
call
that
dancing
then
beckoning
to
her
husband
she
cried
but
they
know
nothing
they
can
not
earn
their
salt
we
have
made
a
bad
bargain
come
then
and
we
will
teach
these
ignorant
ones
the
trescone
luigi
grunted
as
he
rose
unwillingly
from
his
hard
couch
tied
the
monkey
string
about
a
tree
branch
and
came
forward
watch
closely
both
of
you
said
carlotta
to
the
children
it
is
for
you
to
dance
like
tuscans
not
like
marionettes
even
old
ugolone
can
do
better
once
he
was
roused
luigi
weariness
seemed
to
vanish
he
suddenly
seized
carlotta
hands
and
holding
her
at
arm
length
began
to
wheel
and
jump
to
turn
and
twist
in
all
sorts
of
curious
figures
sometimes
the
dancers
arms
were
linked
above
their
heads
sometimes
they
shook
a
lifted
foot
faster
and
faster
they
whirled
and
the
monkey
inspired
by
their
example
began
to
leap
and
bound
about
at
the
end
of
her
string
chattering
wildly
the
speed
of
the
dancers
slackened
like
that
of
a
spinning
top
and
they
came
to
a
sudden
standstill
luigi
returned
to
carina
and
his
place
by
the
fire
and
carlotta
got
out
the
all
the
morning
she
made
the
children
practice
the
figures
of
the
dance
to
music
until
they
were
ready
to
drop
with
fatigue
while
she
prepared
the
soup
for
their
noon
meal
they
were
allowed
to
rest
but
immediately
afterwards
the
donkeys
were
harnessed
again
and
to
the
music
of
their
tinkling
bells
the
little
cavalcade
moved
on
for
some
time
they
travelled
over
the
steep
mountain
roads
without
seeing
a
soul
then
they
met
a
girl
driving
a
flock
of
sheep
to
pasture
later
they
overtook
some
peasant
women
walking
like
queens
with
great
loads
of
wood
on
their
heads
beyond
them
they
passed
an
and
beppo
whispered
to
beppina
it
a
good
sign
to
meet
oxen
in
the
road
but
alas
a
moment
later
they
met
a
priest
mumbling
his
prayers
as
he
walked
it
was
a
glance
of
despair
that
beppina
gave
her
brother
then
for
it
is
very
bad
luck
to
meet
a
priest
in
the
road
as
every
tuscan
child
can
tell
you
nevertheless
all
these
signs
bad
and
good
indicated
that
they
were
approaching
a
town
and
a
few
moments
later
they
came
to
a
stream
where
women
were
washing
clothes
and
the
van
rumbled
across
a
bridge
and
into
the
open
square
of
a
small
mountain
village
in
an
instant
there
was
great
excitement
in
the
town
and
all
the
inhabitants
swarmed
about
the
van
luigi
climbed
down
from
the
driver
seat
with
carina
on
his
shoulder
and
loosed
the
bear
rope
while
carlotta
brought
out
the
organ
and
gave
the
tambourine
to
the
monkey
balla
balla
cried
luigi
and
ugolone
rising
to
his
hind
legs
wearily
began
his
clumsy
dance
the
children
meanwhile
shrank
back
out
of
sight
in
the
van
she
will
make
us
dance
like
the
bear
i
know
she
will
moaned
beppina
and
i
can
not
remember
the
steps
she
crossed
herself
frantically
and
said
a
prayer
to
the
virgin
but
it
was
of
no
avail
for
soon
wheedling
tones
reached
their
avanti
carissimi
she
called
and
not
daring
to
disobey
or
even
to
linger
the
children
leaped
from
the
back
of
the
van
into
the
centre
of
a
crowd
of
villagers
the
children
of
the
marchese
grifoni
dancing
in
company
with
a
monkey
and
a
bear
for
the
entertainment
of
an
audience
of
peasants
the
humiliation
of
it
was
almost
more
than
they
could
endure
but
the
twins
did
their
best
and
the
moment
the
performance
was
over
dived
into
the
back
of
the
van
and
hid
themselves
again
while
carina
leaped
about
among
the
crowd
gathering
the
soldi
in
her
tambourine
their
stay
in
the
village
was
short
for
the
people
were
poor
it
is
a
town
of
pigs
said
carlotta
angrily
as
she
counted
the
money
and
to
the
great
relief
of
the
children
she
gave
the
order
to
move
on
into
the
hills
beyond
the
village
they
stopped
at
one
more
village
during
the
afternoon
and
here
things
went
better
the
children
remembered
their
steps
and
there
were
more
soldi
in
the
tambourine
even
though
ugolone
sat
firmly
down
upon
his
haunches
and
refused
to
budge
in
vain
luigi
tugged
at
his
rope
and
shouted
balla
balla
it
was
as
if
ugolone
seeing
the
children
dance
had
concluded
that
his
dancing
days
were
over
and
had
resigned
in
their
favour
to
make
up
for
ugolone
the
twins
had
to
dance
again
and
again
and
then
to
their
great
surprise
carlotta
made
them
sing
they
had
voices
like
the
whistle
of
song
thrushes
in
the
spring
but
how
in
the
world
could
carlotta
have
guessed
that
they
were
too
astonished
to
refuse
even
if
they
had
dared
so
they
opened
their
mouths
and
quavered
out
a
song
about
the
swallow
which
they
had
learned
in
the
nursery
at
home
this
was
the
song
pilgrim
swallow
lightly
winging
now
upon
the
terrace
sitting
morn
i
hear
thee
singing
in
sad
tones
thy
song
repeating
what
may
be
the
tale
telling
pilgrim
swallow
near
my
dwelling
thou
art
happier
far
than
i
am
on
free
wing
at
least
flying
over
lake
and
breezy
mountain
thou
canst
fill
the
air
with
crying
his
dear
name
through
cave
and
hollow
thou
art
free
thou
pretty
swallow
it
was
so
familiar
a
song
that
all
the
people
joined
with
them
in
singing
it
and
some
of
them
danced
to
the
music
of
the
when
it
played
so
that
altogether
the
villagers
had
a
gay
time
and
as
a
result
carlotta
found
many
more
coins
than
usual
in
the
tambourine
when
the
performance
was
over
she
glanced
triumphantly
at
her
husband
as
she
counted
the
money
we
have
caught
two
pigeons
with
one
pea
after
all
she
said
to
him
as
for
that
lazy
ugolone
he
gets
no
supper
if
he
will
not
work
he
shall
not
eat
the
children
heard
and
shuddered
she
will
treat
us
like
that
too
sobbed
beppina
and
if
she
truly
a
witch
she
may
even
turn
us
into
bears
out
through
sunny
vineyards
and
grey
olive
orchards
beyond
the
town
they
followed
the
winding
road
and
as
night
came
on
the
weary
children
saw
that
they
were
approaching
a
ruined
castle
set
high
on
a
spur
of
the
apennines
the
wind
swept
over
the
bare
and
whistled
through
the
windows
of
its
ruined
towers
where
hundreds
of
years
before
lovely
ladies
had
watched
their
knights
ride
forth
to
battle
it
was
a
bleak
and
lonely
spot
fit
only
to
be
inhabited
by
ghosts
and
beppina
shivered
as
the
wheels
of
the
van
rattled
over
the
ancient
and
stopped
in
the
overgrown
i
know
it
enchanted
she
whispered
to
beppo
and
beppo
his
own
teeth
chattering
could
only
say
remember
about
the
prince
to
keep
up
their
failing
courage
there
was
no
sign
of
human
beings
about
the
place
and
luigi
took
possession
as
if
he
owned
it
he
tied
ugolone
in
the
ruins
of
what
had
once
been
a
stately
and
let
the
donkeys
eat
their
supper
from
the
green
grass
which
carpeted
the
soon
a
fire
was
blazing
in
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
chimney
and
the
tired
travellers
gathered
about
it
for
their
evening
meal
from
the
tower
came
the
surprised
hoot
of
a
solitary
owl
and
bats
disturbed
by
the
light
swooped
in
great
circles
about
the
little
group
as
they
silently
ate
their
polenta
even
the
monkey
seemed
to
feel
the
weird
spell
of
the
place
for
she
cowered
in
a
corner
by
the
fire
chattering
to
herself
while
from
the
came
the
complaining
growls
of
poor
hungry
ugolone
it
was
to
such
music
as
this
that
the
children
of
the
marchese
at
last
fell
asleep
chapter
five
on
the
road
when
they
awoke
the
next
morning
carlotta
and
luigi
were
nowhere
in
sight
the
monkey
was
tied
to
one
wheel
of
the
van
and
from
the
came
the
sound
of
human
voices
quarrelling
the
tones
were
so
loud
that
the
children
could
not
help
hearing
the
words
it
is
all
your
fault
said
luigi
voice
it
was
you
who
made
me
get
the
bear
in
the
first
place
and
undertake
this
foolish
trip
all
because
you
must
again
see
your
people
in
florence
if
we
had
but
stayed
in
venice
the
bear
was
old
when
we
got
him
he
was
already
tired
and
sick
when
we
left
florence
and
now
per
bacco
he
is
dead
you
would
not
feed
him
yet
it
was
ugolone
that
we
depended
upon
to
bring
in
the
money
a
a
monkey
what
are
they
and
now
you
have
added
those
brats
beside
for
us
to
feed
this
comes
of
listening
to
a
woman
and
a
tuscan
at
that
i
could
beat
you
carlotta
wheedling
voice
answered
him
do
not
grieve
my
angel
she
said
you
will
yet
see
the
wisdom
of
your
carlotta
ugolone
was
old
and
sick
it
is
true
a
pest
upon
the
villain
who
sold
him
to
us
may
his
eyes
weep
rivers
of
tears
but
you
are
wrong
about
the
children
they
are
worth
more
than
ugolone
the
donkeys
and
the
van
all
put
together
did
you
not
see
how
they
pleased
the
people
yesterday
i
will
teach
them
to
sing
more
songs
and
to
dance
the
tarantella
as
well
as
the
trescone
and
we
shall
soon
forget
this
sorrow
when
we
reach
the
coast
we
will
sell
the
van
and
the
donkeys
and
go
back
to
your
beloved
venice
to
live
in
comfort
on
the
earnings
of
these
brats
you
shall
see
that
more
of
your
oily
tuscan
talk
growled
luigi
think
of
the
risk
we
run
if
the
ragazzini
should
be
recognised
it
would
go
hard
with
us
their
parents
will
lay
every
trap
to
catch
us
it
is
safe
enough
in
these
mountain
villages
but
in
the
larger
towns
it
will
be
a
different
story
there
are
the
police
carlotta
interrupted
him
che
che
she
cried
you
have
the
heart
of
a
chicken
i
tell
you
even
their
own
mother
would
hardly
know
them
now
and
it
will
be
easy
to
hide
them
in
venice
we
shall
be
like
rats
in
the
walls
of
a
house
where
the
cat
can
not
follow
as
for
traps
we
are
too
sharp
for
them
even
if
we
were
to
be
seen
and
tracked
they
will
not
seek
donkeys
and
a
van
in
venice
where
there
are
no
such
things
luigi
only
grunted
for
reply
and
carlotta
seeing
that
her
arguments
had
made
an
impression
boldly
finished
her
plan
when
we
reach
the
coast
she
said
you
remain
behind
to
sell
the
van
and
i
will
go
on
to
venice
with
the
ragazzini
we
shall
not
be
pursued
upon
the
boat
courage
in
a
few
days
we
shall
be
safe
and
then
we
can
live
at
ease
and
you
will
say
what
a
great
head
has
my
carlotta
there
was
no
reply
from
luigi
and
soon
the
children
heard
their
returning
footfalls
on
the
stone
flagging
pretend
you
asleep
whispered
beppo
we
must
let
them
think
we
overheard
they
instantly
lay
down
in
the
straw
again
and
when
carlotta
came
to
the
back
of
the
van
a
moment
later
she
was
obliged
to
call
twice
before
she
could
arouse
them
while
carlotta
looking
very
glum
was
cooking
the
everlasting
polenta
the
children
crept
fearsomely
into
the
ruined
tower
to
take
a
last
look
at
poor
old
ugolone
there
he
lay
on
the
a
shapeless
lump
of
fur
and
a
little
later
luigi
skinned
him
hung
the
pelt
on
the
back
of
the
van
and
leaving
the
bones
to
whiten
where
they
lay
set
forth
once
more
upon
the
road
from
this
time
on
things
grew
harder
and
harder
for
the
unhappy
children
carlotta
was
caressing
and
smooth
in
her
manner
to
them
when
they
were
in
the
villages
calling
them
my
children
carissimi
which
means
dearest
and
other
tender
names
but
when
they
were
by
themselves
she
grew
more
and
more
harsh
while
luigi
was
sullen
and
scarcely
spoke
to
them
at
all
it
was
carlotta
who
made
them
dance
until
they
were
ready
to
drop
with
fatigue
and
sing
when
their
hearts
were
breaking
everywhere
the
people
thought
them
charming
and
it
was
true
as
carlotta
had
said
that
they
brought
in
more
money
than
ugolone
they
were
now
passing
through
one
of
the
most
lovely
regions
in
the
world
but
its
beauty
failed
to
comfort
them
or
reconcile
them
to
their
lot
the
rocky
ramparts
and
blue
horizon
of
the
mountains
were
but
prison
walls
to
them
from
which
they
longed
to
escape
one
night
as
they
lay
shivering
in
the
straw
with
carlotta
and
luigi
snoring
at
the
other
end
of
the
van
beppo
cautiously
nudged
his
sister
it
sounds
like
teresina
he
whispered
do
you
remember
how
she
snored
that
day
we
left
home
do
begged
beppina
it
makes
me
homesick
i
never
thought
i
could
wish
to
hear
teresina
snore
beppo
answered
but
now
it
would
be
music
in
my
ears
they
were
silent
a
few
minutes
and
then
beppina
timid
beppina
put
her
lips
close
to
beppo
ear
and
whispered
let
get
out
and
run
away
where
to
beppo
whispered
anywhere
away
from
here
said
poor
beppina
i
rather
starve
in
the
mountains
than
stay
any
longer
we
could
creep
out
without
waking
them
it
awfully
dark
said
beppo
and
we
have
to
climb
right
over
them
oh
let
try
urged
beppina
they
sat
up
cautiously
and
peered
out
they
could
just
see
a
dark
mass
blocking
up
the
open
end
of
the
van
they
struggled
to
their
knees
the
straw
rustled
and
they
stopped
dead
until
everything
was
still
again
then
beppo
rose
to
his
feet
and
treading
very
carefully
took
a
step
toward
the
end
of
the
van
but
alas
he
had
forgotten
the
monkey
she
slept
beside
her
mistress
and
beppo
stepped
on
her
tail
there
was
a
scream
as
carina
leaped
up
in
the
air
and
lit
on
beppo
shoulder
chattering
furiously
and
beppo
instantly
dropped
down
into
the
straw
again
what
the
matter
said
carlotta
the
children
could
see
her
dark
silhouette
as
she
sat
up
and
looked
into
the
dark
interior
of
the
van
carina
mia
what
is
the
matter
lie
down
growled
luigi
she
has
had
a
bad
dream
go
to
sleep
the
monkey
leaped
to
carlotta
arm
snuggled
down
beside
her
and
quiet
reigned
once
more
when
the
snores
began
again
the
children
had
no
courage
for
a
second
attempt
and
morning
found
things
as
hopeless
as
ever
they
were
now
descending
the
eastern
slopes
of
the
apennines
and
beppo
remembering
his
geography
knew
that
they
were
getting
farther
and
farther
from
florence
at
noon
that
day
as
they
were
walking
ahead
of
the
van
they
rounded
a
turn
in
the
road
and
came
suddenly
upon
a
view
stretching
far
across
the
plains
of
eastern
italy
to
where
the
blue
waters
of
the
adriatic
lay
sparkling
in
the
sun
the
landscape
was
dotted
with
villages
and
far
away
in
the
blue
distance
they
could
see
the
spires
and
towers
of
a
large
coast
town
beppo
spirits
rose
a
little
see
he
said
to
beppina
we
are
coming
out
of
the
mountains
into
a
region
where
there
are
many
towns
who
knows
perhaps
we
may
find
a
chance
to
get
away
it
would
be
less
dangerous
here
than
in
the
hills
but
again
they
were
doomed
to
disappointment
for
the
next
day
it
rained
and
carlotta
made
them
stay
hidden
in
the
van
as
it
lumbered
slowly
through
the
villages
on
the
road
to
the
sea
though
it
was
only
two
days
it
seemed
at
least
a
week
that
they
lay
in
the
straw
listening
to
the
rumble
of
the
wheels
and
the
patter
of
the
rain
on
the
roof
there
could
be
no
fires
so
their
food
was
bread
and
cheese
which
carlotta
bought
in
the
towns
at
last
early
on
the
third
morning
they
heard
from
their
prison
a
new
sound
and
peering
cautiously
over
luigi
shoulder
saw
that
at
last
they
had
reached
the
sea
they
could
hear
the
slapping
of
waves
against
the
piles
of
a
dock
and
could
catch
glimpses
of
green
water
men
with
trucks
were
hurrying
by
loading
fruit
and
vegetables
upon
a
large
boat
which
was
tied
to
the
pier
there
was
so
much
noise
about
them
that
the
children
could
talk
together
in
low
tones
without
being
overheard
i
know
where
we
are
said
beppo
i
tell
you
i
glad
i
studied
geography
the
sun
is
breaking
through
the
clouds
over
the
water
and
it
early
morning
so
that
the
east
of
course
we
heard
carlotta
say
they
were
going
to
take
us
to
venice
so
this
must
be
a
coast
town
on
the
adriatic
it
is
ravenna
because
ravenna
is
back
from
the
sea
a
few
miles
the
only
other
big
port
along
here
is
rimini
and
i
bet
that
just
where
we
are
oh
beppo
what
a
wonderful
boy
you
are
to
think
that
all
out
yourself
said
beppina
you
such
a
wonderful
thinker
why
you
think
of
away
to
escape
i
do
think
all
the
time
answered
poor
beppo
but
carlotta
is
just
like
a
cat
at
a
her
eyes
never
leave
us
and
if
we
should
try
to
run
she
would
pounce
hush
whispered
beppina
there
she
is
there
indeed
she
was
smiling
craftily
at
them
from
the
end
of
the
van
you
may
come
out
now
my
little
ones
she
said
in
her
most
syrupy
tones
here
we
leave
the
van
with
luigi
while
we
take
a
nice
she
seized
them
firmly
by
the
hands
and
followed
by
luigi
carrying
the
organ
and
the
monkey
led
them
over
the
on
to
the
boat
once
aboard
she
sought
an
obscure
corner
behind
the
baskets
of
fruit
and
vegetables
with
which
the
vessel
was
loaded
and
made
the
children
sit
beside
her
while
luigi
piled
around
them
numerous
bundles
brought
from
the
van
at
last
the
rumble
of
trucks
ceased
the
sailors
loosed
the
great
hawsers
which
tied
the
boat
to
the
dock
and
in
a
few
moments
the
children
looking
back
to
the
shore
saw
a
widening
strip
of
green
water
between
them
and
their
native
land
chapter
six
venice
for
two
beautiful
bright
days
they
remained
on
the
boat
as
it
made
its
way
up
the
eastern
coast
of
italy
and
on
the
morning
of
the
third
there
rising
before
them
out
of
the
mists
like
a
dream
city
afloat
upon
the
waters
was
venice
it
was
so
lovely
with
its
domes
towers
and
palaces
mirrored
in
the
still
waters
and
its
hundreds
of
sails
making
spots
of
bright
colour
against
the
blue
that
for
a
short
time
the
children
almost
forgot
their
grief
as
the
boat
entered
a
great
lagoon
and
slowly
made
its
way
through
the
canal
della
giudecca
to
the
carlotta
grew
more
than
ever
vigilant
the
children
had
hoped
against
hope
that
some
way
of
escape
might
appear
when
they
reached
the
dock
but
carlotta
remained
at
their
elbows
every
moment
and
under
her
watchful
eyes
they
could
not
even
speak
to
each
other
much
less
to
any
one
else
it
was
evident
that
she
meant
to
make
them
understand
how
impossible
it
would
be
for
them
to
get
away
from
venice
for
as
the
boat
rounded
the
western
side
of
the
island
upon
which
the
city
is
built
she
pointed
out
to
them
the
mainland
lying
two
miles
away
across
the
water
and
the
long
black
railroad
bridge
which
is
the
only
connection
between
the
two
you
see
how
it
is
my
little
ones
she
said
one
can
not
leave
venice
without
a
boat
a
ticket
on
the
railway
or
wings
and
truly
how
could
any
one
wish
to
leave
it
luigi
has
been
wretched
all
the
time
he
has
been
away
and
never
wishes
to
desert
his
beloved
city
again
you
too
will
feel
the
same
the
children
made
no
reply
they
were
as
helpless
as
caged
birds
and
could
only
follow
her
silently
as
she
loaded
them
with
bundles
and
herself
carrying
the
organ
and
the
monkey
led
the
way
across
the
to
the
dock
staggering
under
their
burdens
they
entered
the
city
of
venice
oh
if
they
could
only
have
entered
it
with
their
dear
babbo
or
mammina
how
happy
they
would
have
been
for
there
right
before
their
eyes
as
they
walked
were
all
the
wonderful
things
which
beppo
had
learned
about
in
his
geography
there
were
the
canals
with
the
gondolas
flitting
about
on
them
like
black
beetles
on
a
pool
there
were
the
great
beautiful
buildings
with
their
facades
rising
out
of
the
water
and
their
back
doors
opening
upon
narrow
streets
or
tiny
open
squares
there
were
the
glimpses
of
blossoming
hanging
over
high
walls
and
of
balconies
gay
with
potted
geraniums
and
carnations
in
bloom
there
were
the
beautiful
stone
with
gayly
painted
posts
beside
them
to
which
empty
gondolas
were
tied
the
air
was
misty
and
fragrant
with
sea
smells
and
in
every
direction
they
looked
their
eyes
were
greeted
with
the
lovely
colours
of
the
old
buildings
reflected
in
the
water
so
clearly
that
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
two
cities
one
hanging
suspended
upside
down
below
the
other
it
was
so
different
from
florence
from
rome
from
anything
they
had
ever
seen
before
that
the
children
forgot
even
that
they
were
hungry
and
went
up
the
streets
with
wonder
absorbed
in
all
these
marvels
get
on
get
on
said
carlotta
crossly
behind
them
your
eyes
will
pop
out
of
your
heads
and
drop
in
the
street
if
you
stare
so
carina
is
hungry
and
so
am
i
and
we
must
earn
our
dinner
before
we
eat
it
through
one
narrow
street
after
another
they
made
their
way
until
at
last
they
reached
an
open
square
fronting
on
the
water
here
is
the
market
said
carlotta
depositing
the
organ
in
the
middle
of
the
open
space
and
the
children
sighing
with
relief
also
dropped
their
bundles
and
gazed
about
them
drawn
up
to
the
water
edge
were
many
boats
loaded
with
great
baskets
of
fruit
and
vegetables
merchants
swarmed
about
these
boats
like
flies
and
the
produce
was
immediately
purchased
and
placed
in
stalls
or
booths
around
the
edge
of
the
square
where
people
with
on
their
arms
were
buying
their
provisions
for
the
day
it
was
a
busy
and
crowded
place
but
carlotta
gave
the
children
little
time
to
look
dance
she
commanded
as
she
began
to
grind
out
a
tune
upon
the
organ
carina
sprang
to
the
top
of
the
box
and
began
to
hop
up
and
down
in
time
to
the
music
as
the
children
went
through
the
wild
contortions
of
the
trescone
a
crowd
immediately
gathered
about
them
and
the
coins
began
to
rain
into
carina
tambourine
when
the
dance
was
finished
carlotta
led
the
way
to
a
booth
in
the
square
where
hot
macaroni
was
for
sale
and
here
their
hungry
mouths
were
filled
with
the
first
warm
food
they
had
tasted
for
several
days
they
ate
and
were
comforted
then
leaving
the
they
passed
through
narrow
streets
and
over
little
bridges
spanning
the
canals
until
they
reached
another
small
open
square
in
a
crowded
portion
of
the
city
carlotta
walked
faster
and
faster
as
they
approached
it
and
the
twins
had
almost
to
run
to
keep
up
with
her
as
they
entered
the
square
a
small
dirty
boy
about
beppo
size
suddenly
gave
a
shout
it
is
carina
he
cried
and
not
noticing
carlotta
or
the
twins
he
seized
the
monkey
in
his
arms
and
kissed
its
little
black
face
carlotta
gave
him
a
playful
slap
ecco
she
cried
to
the
twins
here
we
have
the
brave
giovanni
and
he
cares
nothing
for
his
godmother
he
loves
only
the
little
black
monkey
see
giovanni
i
have
brought
two
playmates
for
you
they
were
lost
and
i
have
protected
them
out
of
charity
they
will
live
with
us
giovanni
stared
at
the
twins
for
a
moment
then
he
ran
out
his
tongue
at
beppo
i
can
lick
you
he
cried
beppo
stiffened
with
fury
all
the
rage
of
the
past
weeks
rose
up
within
him
and
here
was
some
one
on
whom
he
could
legitimately
wreak
it
he
dropped
his
bundles
rolled
up
his
sleeves
and
roared
come
on
giovanni
threw
the
monkey
at
carlotta
and
instantly
came
on
a
crowd
of
ragged
boys
and
girls
gathered
about
them
and
the
fight
began
it
did
not
last
long
for
beppo
had
taken
along
with
his
other
studies
and
he
met
giovanni
advance
with
a
swift
blow
which
sent
him
spinning
to
the
ground
then
he
sat
upon
him
until
he
begged
for
mercy
while
the
crowd
squealed
with
delight
carlotta
turned
the
organ
and
the
monkey
over
to
beppina
picked
beppo
off
the
prostrate
giovanni
and
then
seizing
the
two
boys
by
their
collars
thumped
their
heads
smartly
together
ecco
she
said
now
you
have
had
your
fight
you
can
be
friends
loading
them
both
with
bundles
she
marched
them
across
the
square
to
the
back
door
of
a
dilapidated
house
with
the
crowd
surging
about
them
here
she
drew
them
into
a
narrow
entrance
and
leading
them
up
two
flights
of
dirty
stairs
knocked
at
a
door
it
was
opened
by
a
slatternly
woman
who
gave
a
shrill
cry
of
astonishment
when
she
saw
the
group
on
her
threshold
the
monkey
evidently
knew
her
for
he
leaped
from
giovanni
arms
to
her
shoulder
and
began
to
pull
her
hair
santa
maria
santa
maria
screamed
the
woman
if
it
is
not
that
devil
of
a
carina
come
back
again
let
go
of
my
hair
you
demon
or
i
wring
your
black
neck
carlotta
laughed
and
picked
the
monkey
off
of
giovanni
mother
just
as
she
had
picked
beppo
off
of
her
son
a
few
moments
before
the
children
left
to
themselves
stared
about
at
their
new
quarters
while
giovanni
stared
at
them
the
room
was
large
bare
dilapidated
and
dirty
on
the
floor
were
some
old
mattresses
filled
with
which
were
evidently
used
as
beds
there
was
a
wooden
table
with
some
soiled
dishes
standing
on
it
and
beyond
this
and
a
few
chairs
there
was
no
furniture
except
two
pots
of
geraniums
on
the
a
door
opened
into
a
smaller
room
beyond
and
through
it
they
could
see
a
stove
with
a
kettle
standing
on
the
floor
beside
it
giovanni
had
evidently
made
up
his
mind
that
any
one
who
could
lick
him
must
indeed
be
a
hero
for
having
finished
his
critical
survey
of
the
twins
he
said
affably
my
father
is
a
gondolier
what
yours
a
marchese
said
beppo
holy
madonna
gasped
the
boy
does
he
do
any
work
no
said
beppo
he
just
goes
to
rome
to
help
the
king
carlotta
overheard
them
do
you
ever
say
that
again
you
wicked
little
liar
she
cried
fiercely
if
you
do
i
cut
off
your
tongue
she
turned
again
to
the
other
woman
do
they
look
like
the
children
of
a
marchese
i
ask
you
she
said
they
were
lost
and
i
have
taken
care
of
them
out
of
charity
they
sing
and
dance
to
pay
for
their
keep
but
it
little
enough
they
bring
in
at
best
old
ugolone
is
dead
and
luigi
has
stayed
behind
to
dispose
of
the
van
and
the
donkeys
with
the
money
he
gets
for
them
he
buy
a
boat
and
pick
up
a
living
on
the
canals
we
shall
go
no
more
on
tours
about
the
country
it
does
not
pay
there
are
as
many
soldi
to
be
found
in
venice
as
anywhere
and
with
the
organ
and
carina
we
shall
get
along
even
with
two
extra
mouths
to
feed
giovanni
mother
winked
her
eye
and
nodded
a
great
many
times
si
si
she
said
there
will
be
many
tourists
in
venice
this
summer
and
it
is
not
to
believe
the
way
americans
throw
money
about
mario
says
their
pockets
are
lined
with
gold
sick
with
terror
the
children
turned
away
from
carlotta
and
looked
out
of
the
windows
see
me
said
giovanni
he
wanted
to
do
something
to
make
himself
admired
after
his
recent
humiliation
so
he
doubled
himself
across
the
sill
of
the
open
window
and
leaned
far
out
over
the
canal
which
flowed
directly
beneath
look
he
cried
waving
his
legs
at
the
peril
of
taking
a
header
into
the
water
his
mother
seized
him
madonna
mia
she
screamed
that
boy
would
rather
drown
than
not
and
giving
him
a
smart
spank
she
jerked
him
back
into
the
room
by
a
leg
giovanni
rubbed
the
spot
and
grinned
sheepishly
as
his
mother
followed
up
the
punishment
by
a
flow
of
speech
which
sounded
to
the
twins
much
like
the
chattering
of
the
monkey
get
along
with
you
she
said
finally
giving
him
a
shove
come
said
carlotta
to
the
twins
when
this
little
scene
was
over
soldi
grow
only
in
the
street
and
picking
up
the
organ
she
led
the
way
down
the
stairs
the
children
were
glad
to
follow
for
they
preferred
the
streets
to
such
a
dwelling
and
giovanni
thinking
it
advisable
to
remain
out
of
his
mother
sight
for
a
while
followed
them
carrying
the
monkey
in
his
arms
chapter
seven
three
weeks
drift
by
all
the
rest
of
that
day
and
for
many
days
after
the
children
followed
carlotta
through
the
maze
of
streets
dancing
and
singing
in
the
piazzas
and
the
or
anywhere
else
where
crowds
were
gathered
giovanni
having
nothing
else
to
do
went
with
them
much
of
the
time
and
added
his
talents
to
the
exhibition
he
could
turn
until
he
looked
like
a
real
whirling
wheel
with
only
four
spokes
and
he
could
walk
on
his
hands
he
was
glad
to
display
these
accomplishments
for
he
liked
being
away
from
home
he
liked
carina
and
best
of
all
he
liked
the
twins
the
three
became
quite
friendly
and
carlotta
seeing
this
smiled
her
sly
smile
and
winked
knowingly
at
giovanni
mother
as
though
to
say
you
see
they
are
getting
used
to
their
new
way
of
living
soon
they
will
forget
their
old
home
and
i
shall
have
no
more
trouble
with
them
little
by
little
the
children
came
to
know
venice
better
than
they
had
known
florence
which
is
not
saying
much
since
in
florence
they
had
so
completely
lost
themselves
they
could
go
from
giovanni
house
to
the
rialto
the
largest
of
the
three
bridges
which
span
the
grand
canal
and
find
their
way
through
the
maze
of
streets
to
the
beautiful
piazza
of
san
marco
they
liked
best
to
go
there
not
only
because
it
is
the
most
beautiful
spot
in
venice
not
even
because
it
is
said
to
be
the
finest
piazza
in
the
world
but
also
because
the
flocks
of
pigeons
flying
about
in
clouds
and
lighting
upon
their
shoulders
made
them
think
of
their
own
little
garden
in
florence
carlotta
liked
the
piazza
because
it
was
the
best
place
in
venice
to
gather
in
the
soldi
there
were
always
tourists
in
the
square
walking
about
with
in
their
hands
and
reading
passages
about
its
history
aloud
to
one
another
indeed
there
was
no
end
to
the
wonderful
things
in
that
famous
square
there
was
the
church
of
san
marco
itself
with
its
beautiful
mosaics
and
the
four
splendid
bronze
horses
over
the
entrance
there
was
the
magnificent
ducal
palace
packed
full
of
thrilling
stories
of
past
splendour
and
back
of
it
spanning
the
canal
the
bridge
of
sighs
which
led
from
the
palace
to
a
dark
prison
on
the
other
side
on
the
day
she
first
saw
that
beppina
shed
tears
thinking
of
all
the
unhappy
prisoners
who
had
passed
over
the
bridge
never
to
return
she
knew
how
prisoners
felt
giovanni
tried
to
comfort
her
do
you
fret
about
them
he
said
they
as
dead
as
they
can
be
all
of
and
in
purgatory
or
a
worse
place
and
you
ca
get
out
no
matter
how
hard
you
pray
come
on
let
go
look
at
the
clock
beppina
knew
that
carlotta
would
be
angry
if
they
lingered
but
still
she
crossed
herself
and
murmured
a
hurried
our
father
for
the
poor
prisoners
on
the
chance
of
its
helping
them
before
she
ran
back
to
beppo
and
giovanni
she
found
them
standing
before
the
great
which
rose
above
a
high
gateway
over
the
street
it
was
almost
noon
and
a
crowd
had
gathered
to
see
the
clock
strike
the
hour
there
was
always
a
group
waiting
there
on
the
hour
for
this
was
no
ordinary
clock
the
children
watched
with
breathless
interest
as
two
bronze
giants
on
the
platform
high
above
their
heads
suddenly
lifted
their
arms
and
struck
a
huge
bell
twelve
times
then
relapsed
into
bronze
statues
again
giovanni
told
the
twins
that
at
the
three
wise
men
came
out
of
the
clock
and
bowed
before
the
madonna
and
child
the
twins
thought
this
could
be
nothing
else
than
a
miracle
but
giovanni
who
was
wise
beyond
his
years
said
it
was
just
works
in
the
clock
insides
it
no
more
a
miracle
than
a
inside
of
you
he
explained
there
was
no
time
for
further
revelations
on
the
day
this
happened
for
at
that
moment
carlotta
called
them
she
was
afraid
the
crowd
would
disperse
before
she
had
coaxed
money
from
their
pockets
every
moment
that
they
were
not
dancing
or
singing
the
children
wandered
about
this
magic
place
where
in
every
direction
they
looked
there
were
wonderful
stories
in
bronze
marble
or
mosaic
one
could
stay
there
a
year
and
not
begin
to
know
them
all
if
it
rained
they
took
refuge
under
the
arcade
of
the
ducal
palace
or
in
the
quiet
interior
of
the
church
of
san
marco
itself
sometimes
they
could
even
step
in
and
pray
before
the
altar
their
prayers
were
always
the
same
that
the
holy
virgin
and
saint
anthony
the
special
guide
of
those
who
were
lost
would
take
care
of
them
and
bring
them
safely
again
to
their
babbo
and
mammina
and
their
lovely
home
many
days
passed
in
this
way
and
it
was
the
middle
of
may
before
the
children
ever
rode
in
a
boat
for
though
giovanni
father
had
a
gondola
it
was
his
business
to
take
passengers
about
venice
just
like
a
in
our
own
cities
and
he
did
not
use
it
for
pleasure
rides
for
giovanni
and
his
friends
then
one
afternoon
when
they
returned
from
singing
in
the
piazza
they
found
luigi
waiting
to
show
carlotta
the
boat
which
he
had
bought
with
the
money
he
received
for
the
donkeys
and
the
van
it
was
not
a
gondola
but
a
a
large
with
a
pair
of
oars
suited
to
carry
either
passengers
or
freight
the
weather
is
warm
now
said
luigi
to
carlotta
the
tourists
are
already
lingering
on
the
canals
for
pleasure
in
the
evenings
and
i
believe
we
should
do
well
to
let
the
children
go
about
with
me
in
the
boat
to
sing
though
they
were
weary
from
dancing
and
singing
all
day
in
the
streets
it
would
be
far
pleasanter
to
drift
about
on
the
canal
in
the
evening
than
to
spend
it
tossing
about
on
the
husk
mattresses
in
squalid
house
and
the
children
listened
with
eager
attention
to
carlotta
reply
as
you
like
she
said
shrugging
her
shoulders
and
that
very
evening
the
plan
was
carried
out
luigi
rowed
the
boat
slowly
about
on
the
grand
canal
and
the
sweet
voices
of
the
children
floating
out
over
the
still
waters
attracted
the
gondolas
about
them
and
many
soldi
were
flung
to
the
singers
as
the
weather
grew
warmer
the
evenings
on
the
canal
grew
longer
and
longer
sometimes
the
gondolas
would
join
together
in
long
chains
and
float
about
in
the
moonlight
with
every
one
joining
in
the
singing
on
festival
nights
there
were
chinese
lanterns
in
every
prow
and
the
boats
flitting
about
over
the
water
looked
like
giant
fireflies
at
play
in
this
way
three
weeks
drifted
by
and
at
last
it
was
june
and
still
the
children
had
made
no
progress
toward
freedom
chapter
eight
beppo
has
a
plan
one
day
when
they
had
just
finished
a
performance
in
the
piazza
and
were
allowed
to
wander
for
a
few
moments
by
themselves
beppo
drew
beppina
to
the
water
edge
and
looking
up
at
the
winged
lion
of
saint
mark
said
to
her
do
you
remember
what
carlotta
said
about
having
to
have
a
boat
a
railroad
ticket
or
wings
to
get
out
of
venice
beppina
remembered
very
well
the
wings
on
that
lion
made
me
think
of
it
said
beppo
and
thought
of
something
else
too
there
another
thing
you
need
and
that
brains
i
got
those
and
i
going
to
get
out
of
this
old
place
or
die
in
the
attempt
oh
beppo
breathed
beppina
how
i
got
it
all
planned
said
beppo
i
guess
saint
anthony
must
have
put
it
into
your
head
sighed
beppina
for
he
takes
care
of
all
the
lost
people
anyway
you
have
thought
of
anything
before
i
thought
of
this
my
own
self
said
beppo
rather
resentfully
well
said
beppina
clasping
her
hands
you
think
and
i
pray
i
going
to
begin
a
novena
i
pray
hard
to
saint
anthony
every
day
for
nine
days
and
ask
him
to
please
please
guide
us
i
going
to
begin
right
now
she
crossed
herself
and
began
moving
her
lips
in
prayer
but
got
no
farther
than
blessed
saint
anthony
when
beppo
nudged
her
with
his
elbow
stop
it
he
whispered
here
comes
the
old
cat
he
meant
carlotta
do
you
let
her
catch
you
praying
to
saint
anthony
or
she
know
what
we
up
to
you
can
pray
like
fury
but
say
your
prayers
in
your
heart
and
then
some
night
if
i
wake
you
up
you
just
keep
as
still
as
a
mouse
and
follow
me
carlotta
reached
them
just
then
and
ordered
them
to
go
with
her
back
to
the
cathedral
to
sing
and
all
that
day
there
was
no
chance
for
beppo
to
explain
his
great
idea
beppina
caught
him
many
times
with
his
forehead
all
snarled
up
as
if
he
were
trying
to
think
how
much
times
was
or
something
hard
like
that
but
just
what
he
had
in
mind
she
could
not
guess
that
night
when
they
were
out
in
the
boat
beppo
asked
luigi
if
he
might
try
to
row
it
home
and
luigi
being
willing
to
loaf
whenever
it
was
possible
said
he
might
beppo
did
so
well
that
night
that
on
the
next
luigi
allowed
him
to
row
as
well
as
sing
and
very
soon
beppo
came
to
know
his
way
about
the
grand
canal
better
than
he
knew
the
oh
much
better
at
last
one
night
after
they
had
gone
to
bed
beppo
lay
still
for
a
long
time
until
he
was
sure
that
every
one
else
in
the
room
was
asleep
then
he
quietly
woke
beppina
and
the
two
slid
from
their
mattresses
to
the
floor
here
they
waited
a
moment
for
the
husks
rattled
a
little
and
then
as
no
one
stirred
they
moved
stealthily
to
the
door
carrying
their
shoes
in
their
hands
they
had
slept
in
their
clothes
for
they
still
wore
the
ones
carlotta
had
given
them
and
had
not
seen
their
own
since
the
day
she
had
made
them
change
in
the
van
they
almost
suffocated
with
fright
as
they
opened
the
door
for
it
creaked
and
they
feared
the
monkey
would
begin
to
chatter
but
carina
was
tired
too
and
slept
as
soundly
as
the
rest
in
a
moment
they
had
quietly
closed
it
behind
them
and
were
feeling
their
way
in
the
dark
down
the
stairs
and
through
the
passage
at
the
bottom
to
the
canal
entrance
of
the
house
where
mario
and
luigi
kept
their
oars
beppo
had
noted
carefully
when
they
came
in
just
where
luigi
had
placed
his
and
feeling
cautiously
along
the
wall
with
his
hands
was
able
to
locate
them
in
the
dark
he
gave
his
shoes
to
his
sister
took
down
the
oars
and
managed
to
get
them
to
the
door
without
knocking
anything
over
or
dropping
them
on
the
stone
floor
followed
by
beppina
who
was
holding
on
to
his
coat
and
praying
to
saint
anthony
under
her
breath
he
reached
the
water
entrance
to
the
house
and
stood
upon
the
landing
luigi
boat
and
mario
gondola
were
both
tied
to
a
red
pole
beside
the
entrance
beppo
put
one
oar
down
on
the
step
and
with
the
other
managed
to
reach
the
pointed
prow
of
the
boat
and
draw
it
to
the
step
then
he
leaped
in
helped
beppina
in
with
the
shoes
took
the
other
oar
into
the
boat
with
him
and
untying
the
rope
which
fastened
it
to
the
pole
shot
out
into
the
stream
there
was
a
scraping
noise
as
the
boat
swung
against
the
and
beppo
used
the
oar
to
push
it
away
there
was
also
the
rattling
of
the
as
he
backed
round
and
glided
out
into
the
canal
but
though
he
was
nearly
dead
with
excitement
and
fright
beppo
kept
his
head
never
had
he
managed
the
boat
so
well
it
slid
through
the
water
like
a
fish
they
had
gone
two
or
three
hundred
feet
and
reached
the
point
where
the
smaller
waterway
opened
into
the
grand
canal
when
beppina
was
appalled
to
see
the
dim
outline
of
another
boat
a
little
distance
behind
them
they
following
she
gasped
oh
beppo
hurry
beppo
bent
to
his
oars
and
the
boat
fairly
shot
through
the
water
on
and
on
they
sped
past
the
great
palaces
now
dark
and
grim
in
starlight
past
the
round
the
great
curve
of
the
canal
and
soon
to
their
great
relief
the
black
boat
was
no
longer
following
do
you
suppose
it
was
luigi
gasped
beppina
no
said
beppo
he
could
possibly
have
got
after
us
so
quickly
because
i
untied
mario
gondola
too
it
would
drift
away
far
enough
so
luigi
would
have
to
swim
to
get
it
and
he
could
do
it
in
this
time
i
know
maybe
it
was
a
police
boat
or
maybe
it
was
some
one
going
home
late
anyway
he
was
after
us
so
i
do
care
who
he
was
oh
beppo
tell
me
your
plan
where
are
we
going
begged
beppina
keep
still
growled
beppo
the
less
noise
we
make
the
more
chance
there
is
of
our
getting
away
beppina
crumpled
up
in
the
bottom
and
said
no
more
while
beppo
made
the
boat
skim
on
over
the
dark
waters
at
last
he
turned
the
prow
toward
shore
and
touched
at
a
dock
where
many
boats
were
already
moored
there
was
no
sign
of
life
about
the
place
as
they
disembarked
there
was
only
the
soft
lapping
of
the
water
to
break
the
silence
stoop
down
whispered
beppo
these
are
the
boats
that
cross
over
to
mestre
on
the
mainland
before
daylight
to
bring
fruit
and
vegetables
back
to
market
and
it
may
be
that
some
of
the
men
sleep
in
the
boats
we
might
wake
them
for
a
few
moments
they
listened
crouching
down
on
the
dock
and
then
as
they
heard
no
sound
beppo
gave
the
sandalo
a
shove
away
from
shore
and
let
go
the
rope
oh
whispered
beppina
why
did
you
do
that
we
do
want
it
any
more
answered
beppo
and
if
they
find
it
they
think
we
fell
out
and
were
drowned
then
they
wo
look
for
us
oh
beppo
said
beppina
what
a
wonderful
boy
you
are
i
been
planning
this
a
long
time
beppo
answered
with
a
little
of
his
old
swagger
but
we
are
out
of
our
troubles
yet
they
crept
along
the
dock
on
their
hands
and
knees
until
they
came
to
one
of
the
largest
boats
in
the
fleet
here
beppo
paused
and
after
carefully
examining
to
be
sure
it
was
the
one
he
was
looking
for
he
helped
beppina
aboard
and
climbed
in
after
her
there
was
a
pile
of
empty
baskets
and
boxes
at
one
end
of
the
boat
and
behind
these
the
children
hid
themselves
to
wait
for
dawn
for
a
long
time
they
crouched
there
listening
to
the
thumping
of
their
own
hearts
and
the
of
the
water
and
at
last
completely
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
fright
curled
up
on
the
floor
of
the
boat
and
fell
sound
asleep
chapter
nine
the
escape
beppo
awoke
next
morning
in
the
early
dawn
and
forgetting
where
he
was
stretched
his
cramped
legs
in
doing
so
he
kicked
over
a
basket
which
fell
on
beppina
beppina
instantly
sat
up
and
blinking
with
sleep
said
quite
loudly
where
are
we
she
might
well
ask
for
there
directly
in
front
of
her
pulling
stoutly
at
a
pair
of
oars
sat
a
short
man
with
brown
skin
and
rings
in
his
ears
the
level
rays
of
the
sun
just
rising
over
venice
shone
full
upon
his
face
and
astonished
eyes
as
he
gazed
at
the
apparition
before
him
just
then
beppo
head
appeared
beside
his
sister
and
the
man
overcome
with
astonishment
caught
a
crab
and
splashed
both
children
with
water
before
he
burst
into
speech
madonna
mia
he
cried
am
i
bewitched
how
in
the
name
of
all
the
saints
in
paradise
did
you
get
into
this
boat
you
were
in
it
when
i
left
the
dock
oh
yes
we
were
said
beppo
we
were
behind
the
baskets
but
what
are
you
here
for
demanded
the
man
we
want
to
go
to
mestre
said
beppo
the
man
regarded
them
suspiciously
do
your
folks
know
where
you
are
he
asked
no
said
beppo
that
why
we
are
here
we
want
to
get
back
to
them
beppina
interrupted
we
were
stolen
away
by
gypsies
she
said
then
still
staring
at
them
the
man
asked
where
are
you
from
from
florence
beppo
answered
the
man
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
that
a
likely
story
he
roared
from
florence
ha
ha
very
good
per
bacco
you
are
indeed
clever
liars
you
are
a
pair
of
naughty
little
runaways
that
what
you
are
and
if
i
had
time
i
take
you
straight
back
to
venice
now
as
it
is
i
wait
until
i
get
my
load
and
then
back
you
go
and
i
hope
you
get
a
good
spanking
into
the
bargain
the
children
said
nothing
they
could
they
were
crushed
but
during
the
rest
of
the
journey
beppo
thought
as
he
had
never
thought
in
his
life
before
while
beppina
prayed
fervently
under
her
breath
during
the
weeks
that
they
had
been
so
closely
watched
by
carlotta
beppina
had
grown
almost
to
read
beppo
thoughts
so
when
he
furtively
took
her
hand
lifted
one
eyebrow
and
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
mestre
she
knew
he
meant
to
try
to
go
forward
no
matter
what
happened
they
were
now
nearly
across
the
lagoon
and
approaching
the
harbour
early
as
it
was
the
water
was
already
swarming
with
craft
of
all
descriptions
for
venice
has
to
get
all
her
supplies
from
the
mainland
and
many
boats
are
required
for
the
traffic
there
was
consequently
a
great
deal
of
shouting
back
and
forth
as
the
men
jockeyed
for
the
best
positions
at
the
dock
their
own
brown
boatman
was
so
busy
bawling
at
his
competitors
and
shunting
about
that
for
a
few
moments
he
was
unable
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
children
at
last
however
he
crowded
in
between
two
other
boats
and
while
he
was
explaining
to
their
owners
that
they
were
the
sons
of
pigs
to
take
up
so
much
room
beppo
seized
his
sister
by
the
arm
and
the
two
leaped
into
the
next
boat
from
that
to
a
third
and
then
to
the
dock
and
before
their
captor
realised
they
were
gone
they
were
already
speeding
frantically
up
the
dock
stop
them
stop
them
howled
the
boatman
climbing
out
and
starting
in
pursuit
two
or
three
other
men
joined
him
shouting
stop
stop
too
but
their
calls
only
lent
speed
to
the
flying
feet
of
the
runaways
they
did
not
know
where
they
were
going
but
they
ran
as
rabbits
run
when
the
dogs
are
after
them
and
soon
found
themselves
in
the
streets
of
the
town
the
cries
of
their
pursuers
grew
fainter
and
were
lost
altogether
as
beppo
suddenly
dashed
into
a
side
street
and
they
doubled
on
their
tracks
from
a
safe
behind
an
old
building
in
an
alley
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
their
pursuers
as
they
turned
back
to
the
boats
talking
volubly
and
gesticulating
like
windmills
they
were
telling
the
boatman
who
had
brought
the
children
over
what
they
thought
of
him
for
getting
them
into
such
a
chase
beppo
actually
chuckled
as
he
watched
them
go
so
great
was
his
relief
now
beppina
he
said
almost
gayly
we
hurry
to
the
other
end
of
the
town
as
fast
as
we
can
go
and
get
something
to
eat
i
got
ten
soldi
in
my
pocket
that
i
picked
up
when
luigi
was
looking
and
as
hungry
as
a
bear
they
wo
follow
us
any
more
but
we
keep
out
of
sight
until
the
shops
are
open
anyway
for
an
hour
or
more
they
wandered
quietly
about
through
the
of
the
town
until
they
found
a
small
on
an
unfrequented
street
and
when
an
old
woman
appeared
and
took
down
the
shutters
they
went
in
and
boldly
asked
for
bread
and
cheese
the
woman
eyed
them
with
some
curiosity
but
asked
no
questions
and
they
got
out
as
quickly
as
possible
and
hid
behind
an
empty
house
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
to
eat
their
breakfast
i
sure
of
one
thing
said
beppo
as
he
munched
his
bread
i
not
going
to
tell
our
story
to
any
one
after
this
people
would
only
think
we
were
lying
we
find
our
own
way
to
the
villa
and
earn
our
money
as
we
go
along
padua
is
only
about
thirty
miles
from
here
anyway
oh
beppo
said
beppina
much
impressed
how
did
you
know
that
geography
said
beppo
proudly
you
remember
how
i
knew
about
ravenna
and
rimini
and
besides
the
other
day
i
asked
a
tourist
to
let
me
see
the
map
in
the
guidebook
padua
is
almost
straight
west
from
here
we
can
go
away
from
the
sun
in
the
morning
and
toward
it
in
the
afternoon
and
we
ca
help
running
into
it
we
dance
in
the
villages
as
we
go
along
and
when
we
get
to
padua
it
will
be
easy
enough
to
find
the
villa
beppina
had
some
secret
doubts
she
remembered
how
sure
beppo
was
about
finding
his
way
in
florence
but
she
did
say
a
word
she
was
willing
to
take
any
risk
if
only
they
could
keep
out
of
the
clutches
of
carlotta
do
you
suppose
they
are
hunting
for
us
in
venice
she
asked
i
should
wonder
answered
her
brother
glancing
at
the
sun
then
he
chuckled
i
bet
they
mad
i
hope
they
never
find
their
old
boats
let
get
away
from
here
as
fast
as
we
can
urged
beppina
they
might
follow
us
or
they
might
send
word
to
the
police
that
true
said
beppo
we
ca
be
too
careful
they
had
finished
their
breakfast
by
this
time
and
taking
their
direction
from
the
sun
set
forth
at
once
toward
the
west
soon
they
were
out
among
the
suburbs
then
they
passed
stately
villas
owned
by
wealthy
venetians
and
beyond
that
came
into
open
country
it
was
much
easier
walking
than
it
had
been
in
the
mountains
for
the
land
was
level
or
gently
rolling
the
villages
were
near
together
and
the
highways
well
travelled
moreover
they
had
been
hardened
to
much
walking
by
their
weeks
of
constant
practice
and
were
able
to
trot
along
the
road
at
a
good
rate
of
speed
at
noon
they
reached
a
village
and
here
they
decided
to
replenish
their
little
hoard
of
money
so
making
their
way
to
the
piazza
they
surrounded
themselves
with
a
crowd
for
whom
they
danced
the
trescone
and
sang
themselves
hoarse
they
were
just
gathering
up
the
few
coins
that
were
thrown
to
them
when
beppo
saw
a
policeman
approaching
and
not
wishing
to
take
any
chances
the
two
children
instantly
disappeared
like
smoke
down
a
side
street
and
out
into
the
highway
once
more
by
they
had
covered
ten
miles
and
when
night
overtook
them
they
were
in
open
farming
country
surrounded
by
olive
orchards
vineyards
and
cornfields
in
a
field
beside
the
road
they
came
upon
a
and
hiding
themselves
on
the
farther
side
of
it
they
ate
the
bread
and
ham
which
they
had
bought
on
the
way
and
then
pulling
the
straw
down
over
them
for
covering
slept
peacefully
until
morning
chapter
ten
home
again
the
next
day
and
the
next
passed
in
much
the
same
way
they
danced
and
sang
in
the
villages
to
earn
their
bread
and
then
passed
out
again
to
the
highway
where
there
were
to
guide
them
or
they
could
ask
directions
from
fellow
travellers
one
night
they
passed
in
an
olive
orchard
under
a
spreading
tree
another
was
spent
under
the
protection
of
a
wayside
shrine
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
beppo
found
his
sister
kneeling
before
the
shrine
she
turned
a
beaming
face
upon
him
as
he
opened
his
eyes
oh
beppo
mio
she
said
i
have
forgotten
once
and
this
is
the
ninth
day
i
made
my
novena
i
almost
sure
the
blessed
saint
anthony
means
to
get
us
to
padua
this
very
day
if
he
does
i
think
i
shall
die
of
joy
what
would
be
the
good
of
that
beppo
inquired
practically
then
he
added
anyway
i
think
it
be
very
mean
if
he
does
after
all
the
praying
you
done
and
all
my
thinking
too
they
ate
a
hasty
bite
of
bread
beside
the
shrine
then
trudged
on
and
before
the
morning
was
over
actually
found
themselves
passing
through
the
beautiful
gardens
which
surround
the
city
of
padua
they
entered
it
from
the
east
by
the
porta
di
pontecorbo
walked
a
short
distance
along
a
wide
street
crossed
a
canal
and
turning
to
the
left
saw
rising
before
them
from
a
great
open
piazza
the
huge
church
of
saint
anthony
of
padua
crowned
by
its
six
domes
and
many
spires
it
was
as
if
they
had
known
every
inch
of
the
way
so
directly
had
they
come
the
bells
of
the
church
were
pealing
joyfully
and
the
square
was
full
of
people
all
going
toward
the
church
for
it
was
the
festa
of
saint
anthony
though
the
children
did
not
know
it
glanced
curiously
at
the
two
queer
forlorn
little
figures
but
no
one
spoke
to
them
and
they
stood
for
a
moment
uncertain
what
to
do
or
in
what
direction
to
go
when
suddenly
beppina
gave
a
shriek
of
joy
and
springing
forward
threw
her
arms
about
a
tall
woman
in
a
nurse
ruff
and
streamers
who
was
hurrying
toward
the
church
carrying
an
immense
loaf
of
bread
in
her
hand
teresina
screamed
beppina
the
woman
looked
at
the
child
in
blank
astonishment
but
it
was
not
until
she
saw
beppo
that
the
light
of
recognition
dawned
in
her
face
then
dropping
the
bread
and
falling
upon
her
knees
she
engulfed
both
ragged
dirty
children
in
a
wide
embrace
oh
thanks
be
to
god
the
blessed
virgin
and
saint
anthony
you
are
found
again
she
cried
her
eyes
streaming
tears
and
her
tongue
prayers
of
thanksgiving
at
the
same
time
i
was
just
on
my
way
to
offer
this
bread
at
the
shrine
of
the
blessed
saint
and
pray
as
i
have
prayed
daily
since
you
were
lost
that
you
might
be
found
again
and
here
before
i
have
even
been
to
the
church
at
all
the
blessed
saint
has
heard
my
prayers
and
you
rise
up
before
me
as
if
out
of
the
ground
it
is
a
miracle
ah
madonna
mia
what
tears
the
signora
has
wept
for
you
and
the
signore
your
father
he
has
not
slept
for
seeking
you
come
come
do
not
delay
we
must
send
word
to
the
villa
at
once
that
they
may
come
running
to
meet
you
even
as
his
father
met
the
prodigal
son
her
tongue
ran
so
fast
that
the
children
had
no
chance
to
ask
questions
a
crowd
now
gathered
about
them
and
when
teresina
had
explained
the
cause
of
the
excitement
and
joy
sympathetic
bystanders
rushed
to
send
word
to
the
villa
seven
miles
away
and
to
spread
the
good
news
that
the
children
of
the
marchese
grifoni
for
whom
the
police
had
been
searching
every
town
in
italy
for
two
months
had
now
appeared
in
padua
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
saint
anthony
is
the
patron
saint
of
all
who
suffer
loss
said
the
pious
ones
and
many
a
candle
was
gratefully
offered
on
his
shrine
that
day
when
her
joy
had
a
little
subsided
teresina
gazed
with
horror
at
the
twins
they
were
indeed
a
terrifying
spectacle
ragged
thin
encrusted
with
dirt
with
their
toes
sticking
through
their
shoes
it
is
no
wonder
that
she
did
not
at
once
recognise
the
children
of
the
marchese
grasping
them
by
the
hands
as
if
she
would
never
again
let
them
go
teresina
hurried
them
toward
the
hotel
due
croci
bianche
which
opened
upon
the
square
followed
by
crowds
of
interested
spectators
the
landlord
himself
when
the
news
reached
him
came
out
to
greet
the
wanderers
and
conduct
them
to
a
room
teresina
went
with
them
giving
orders
right
and
left
as
she
flew
down
the
long
corridor
it
is
for
the
marchese
grifoni
she
cried
to
the
bewildered
servants
as
she
hustled
the
children
before
her
to
the
bath
bring
soap
bring
towels
bring
food
and
for
the
love
of
saint
anthony
keep
the
wires
hot
to
the
villa
never
mind
the
cost
for
the
lost
is
found
they
will
reward
you
well
tell
them
for
the
love
of
heaven
to
bring
clothes
for
the
signorina
and
don
beppo
and
hurry
hurry
hurry
then
she
shut
the
door
upon
her
charges
and
the
process
of
purification
began
she
rang
the
bell
furiously
a
few
moments
later
and
opening
the
door
a
crack
handed
the
servant
who
answered
it
a
bundle
hastily
wrapped
in
newspaper
their
clothes
she
said
briefly
the
marchesa
must
not
see
them
burn
them
at
once
for
one
hour
or
more
she
scrubbed
and
shampooed
and
all
but
boiled
the
wanderers
alive
in
her
frantic
efforts
to
get
them
clean
before
their
mother
should
be
able
to
reach
them
at
last
a
carriage
drawn
by
a
pair
of
steaming
black
horses
dashed
up
to
the
hotel
and
the
beautiful
marchesa
pale
but
radiant
sprang
out
and
attended
by
the
landlord
himself
hurried
to
the
room
where
her
lost
ones
waited
to
embrace
her
teresina
opened
the
door
and
stepping
into
the
hall
left
the
mother
and
children
together
with
no
human
eye
to
see
that
meeting
herself
and
wiping
her
nose
vigorously
on
her
apron
she
went
down
to
tell
the
footman
all
the
news
and
to
get
the
bundle
of
clothes
for
the
children
which
in
the
haste
and
excitement
had
been
left
in
the
carriage
an
hour
later
the
marchesa
and
two
very
clean
and
happy
children
came
out
of
the
hotel
followed
by
teresina
the
coachman
grinning
as
teresina
said
like
a
cracked
melon
greeted
the
children
as
if
he
were
an
old
friend
and
the
marchesa
standing
in
her
carriage
scattered
tips
with
a
lavish
hand
they
drove
away
with
the
landlord
bowing
from
the
doorway
and
the
crowd
shouting
vivas
as
long
as
the
carriage
was
in
sight
it
was
a
long
drive
over
beautiful
winding
roadways
to
the
villa
and
every
inch
of
the
way
the
marchesa
sat
with
her
arms
clasped
about
her
darlings
telling
them
of
their
father
who
was
still
in
florence
conducting
the
search
of
the
baby
who
had
six
teeth
and
was
fat
as
butter
and
hearing
from
them
the
tale
of
their
adventures
while
teresina
beamed
at
them
from
the
opposite
seat
at
last
they
rounded
a
curve
in
the
road
and
there
shining
down
on
them
from
the
summit
of
a
hill
overlooking
the
village
was
their
own
white
villa
the
children
shouted
with
joy
when
they
saw
it
and
beppina
threw
a
kiss
then
they
heard
a
great
shouting
down
the
road
all
the
village
had
come
out
to
greet
the
children
of
their
beloved
marchesa
old
and
young
they
swarmed
about
the
carriage
shouting
ben
trovati
which
means
welcome
and
tossing
flowers
at
the
feet
of
the
returned
travellers
ah
what
a
happy
time
it
was
at
last
the
carriage
stood
before
the
loggia
of
the
villa
and
when
his
old
dog
barking
with
joy
came
bounding
out
to
meet
them
beppo
who
had
been
and
brave
through
all
the
dreadful
weeks
buried
his
head
in
tonio
shaggy
fur
and
gave
way
to
tears
after
the
baby
had
been
kissed
and
the
servants
greeted
and
all
the
dear
familiar
places
visited
once
more
it
was
time
for
supper
and
oh
what
a
supper
it
was
the
cook
the
moment
the
wonderful
news
had
reached
the
villa
had
flown
to
the
kitchen
and
there
she
had
cooked
all
their
favourite
dishes
there
were
artichokes
for
beppina
and
for
beppo
and
a
cake
as
soft
and
light
as
for
dessert
in
the
evening
they
received
a
telegram
of
welcome
from
their
dear
babbo
in
florence
for
the
good
news
had
been
flashed
across
the
wires
to
him
and
all
the
servants
in
the
grifoni
palace
were
rejoicing
too
when
bedtime
came
instead
of
lying
down
upon
straw
or
a
husk
mattress
the
twins
had
their
own
mother
to
tuck
them
in
their
own
white
beds
in
their
own
dear
clean
rooms
and
then
to
sing
them
to
sleep
as
she
had
done
when
they
were
little
little
children
long
after
they
were
safe
in
dreamland
the
marchesa
lingered
beside
their
beds
and
then
throwing
herself
upon
her
knees
before
the
image
of
the
madonna
in
her
own
room
she
poured
out
her
grateful
heart
in
thanksgiving
to
that
other
mother
who
had
lived
and
suffered
too
appendix
suggestions
to
teachers
the
citizens
of
america
are
one
and
all
the
descendants
of
immigrants
and
they
must
never
lose
their
sympathy
with
the
things
that
are
best
in
foreign
lands
italy
has
sent
us
hundreds
of
thousands
of
new
citizens
and
these
people
and
their
children
are
among
the
most
loyal
americans
between
the
united
states
and
italy
there
has
been
a
long
friendship
without
mistrust
and
without
strife
this
is
because
the
national
ideals
of
the
united
states
and
of
italy
are
so
much
alike
and
because
each
country
possesses
a
great
industrious
population
in
america
the
italians
find
an
opportunity
to
go
forward
in
those
paths
which
most
warmly
appeal
to
them
and
which
they
can
follow
with
no
breach
of
tradition
no
break
of
affections
no
sundering

ancient
and
beloved
ties
italy

us

americanisation

this

the
converting

this
country
but
also
the
fusing
of
their
highest
ideals
into
our
own
teachers
can
use
italian

the
