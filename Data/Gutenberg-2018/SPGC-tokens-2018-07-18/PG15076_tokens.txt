introduction
the
theoretical
study
of
war
its
use
and
limitations
at
first
sight
nothing
can
appear
more
unpractical
less
promising
of
useful
result
than
to
approach
the
study
of
war
with
a
theory
there
seems
indeed
to
be
something
essentially
antagonistic
between
the
habit
of
mind
that
seeks
theoretical
guidance
and
that
which
makes
for
the
successful
conduct
of
war
the
conduct
of
war
is
so
much
a
question
of
personality
of
character
of
of
rapid
decision
upon
complex
and
factors
and
those
factors
themselves
are
so
varied
so
intangible
so
dependent
upon
unstable
moral
and
physical
conditions
that
it
seems
incapable
of
being
reduced
to
anything
like
true
scientific
analysis
at
the
bare
idea
of
a
theory
or
science
of
war
the
mind
recurs
uneasily
to
cases
where
highly
scientific
officers
failed
as
leaders
yet
on
the
other
hand
no
one
will
deny
that
since
the
great
theorists
of
the
early
nineteenth
century
attempted
to
produce
a
reasoned
theory
of
war
its
planning
and
conduct
have
acquired
a
method
a
precision
and
a
certainty
of
grasp
which
were
unknown
before
still
less
will
any
one
deny
the
value
which
the
shrewdest
and
most
successful
leaders
in
war
have
placed
upon
the
work
of
the
classical
strategical
writers
the
truth
is
that
the
mistrust
of
theory
arises
from
a
misconception
of
what
it
is
that
theory
claims
to
do
it
does
not
pretend
to
give
the
power
of
conduct
in
the
field
it
claims
no
more
than
to
increase
the
effective
power
of
conduct
its
main
practical
value
is
that
it
can
assist
a
capable
man
to
acquire
a
broad
outlook
whereby
he
may
be
the
surer
his
plan
shall
cover
all
the
ground
and
whereby
he
may
with
greater
rapidity
and
certainty
seize
all
the
factors
of
a
sudden
situation
the
greatest
of
the
theorists
himself
puts
the
matter
quite
frankly
of
theoretical
study
he
says
it
should
educate
the
mind
of
the
man
who
is
to
lead
in
war
or
rather
guide
him
to
but
it
should
not
accompany
him
on
the
field
of
battle
its
practical
utility
however
is
not
by
any
means
confined
to
its
effects
upon
the
powers
of
a
leader
it
is
not
enough
that
a
leader
should
have
the
ability
to
decide
rightly
his
subordinates
must
seize
at
once
the
full
meaning
of
his
decision
and
be
able
to
express
it
with
certainty
in
action
for
this
every
man
concerned
must
have
been
trained
to
think
in
the
same
plane
the
chief
order
must
awake
in
every
brain
the
same
process
of
thought
his
words
must
have
the
same
meaning
for
all
if
a
theory
of
tactics
had
existed
in
and
if
captain
carkett
had
had
a
sound
training
in
such
a
theory
he
could
not
possibly
have
misunderstood
rodney
signal
as
it
was
the
real
intention
of
the
signal
was
obscure
and
rodney
neglect
to
explain
the
tactical
device
it
indicated
robbed
his
country
of
a
victory
at
an
hour
of
the
direst
need
there
had
been
no
previous
theoretical
training
to
supply
the
omission
and
rodney
fine
conception
was
unintelligible
to
anybody
but
himself
nor
is
it
only
for
the
sake
of
mental
solidarity
between
a
chief
and
his
subordinates
that
theory
is
indispensable
it
is
of
still
higher
value
for
producing
a
similar
solidarity
between
him
and
his
superiors
at
the
council
table
at
home
how
often
have
officers
dumbly
acquiesced
in
operations
simply
for
lack
of
the
mental
power
and
verbal
apparatus
to
convince
an
impatient
minister
where
the
errors
of
his
plan
lay
how
often
moreover
have
statesmen
and
officers
even
in
the
most
harmonious
conference
been
unable
to
decide
on
a
coherent
plan
of
war
from
inability
to
analyse
scientifically
the
situation
they
had
to
face
and
to
recognise
the
general
character
of
the
struggle
in
which
they
were
about
to
engage
that
the
true
nature
of
a
war
should
be
realised
by
contemporaries
as
clearly
as
it
comes
to
be
seen
afterwards
in
the
fuller
light
of
history
is
seldom
to
be
expected
at
close
range
accidental
factors
will
force
themselves
into
undue
prominence
and
tend
to
obscure
the
true
horizon
such
error
can
scarcely
ever
be
eliminated
but
by
theoretical
study
we
can
reduce
it
nor
by
any
other
means
can
we
hope
to
approach
the
clearness
of
vision
with
which
posterity
will
read
our
mistakes
theory
is
in
fact
a
question
of
education
and
deliberation
and
not
of
execution
at
all
that
depends
on
the
combination
of
intangible
human
qualities
which
we
call
executive
ability
this
then
is
all
the
great
authorities
ever
claimed
for
theory
but
to
this
claim
the
chief
of
them
at
least
after
years
of
active
service
on
the
staff
attached
the
highest
importance
in
actual
operations
he
wrote
in
one
of
his
latest
memoranda
men
are
guided
solely
by
their
judgment
and
it
will
hit
the
mark
more
or
less
accurately
according
as
they
possess
more
or
less
genius
this
is
the
way
all
great
generals
have
acted
thus
it
will
always
be
in
action
and
so
far
judgment
will
suffice
but
when
it
is
a
question
not
of
taking
action
yourself
but
of
convincing
others
at
the
council
table
then
everything
depends
on
clear
conceptions
and
the
exposition
of
the
inherent
relations
of
things
so
little
progress
has
been
made
in
this
respect
that
most
deliberations
are
merely
verbal
contentions
which
rest
on
no
firm
foundation
and
end
either
in
every
one
retaining
his
own
opinion
or
in
a
compromise
from
considerations
of
mutual
respect
a
middle
course
of
no
actual
value
clausewitz

the
references
are
to
colonel
translation
of
the
third
german
edition
but
his
wording
is
not
always
followed
exactly
the
writer
experience
of
such
discussions
was
rich
and
at
first
hand
clear
conceptions
of
the
ideas
and
factors
involved
in
a
war
problem
and
a
definite
exposition
of
the
relations
between
them
were
in
his
eyes
the
remedy
for
loose
and
purposeless
discussion
and
such
conceptions
and
expositions
are
all
we
mean
by
the
theory
or
the
science
of
war
it
is
a
process
by
which
we
our
ideas
define
the
meaning
of
the
words
we
use
grasp
the
difference
between
essential
and
unessential
factors
and
fix
and
expose
the
fundamental
data
on
which
every
one
is
agreed
in
this
way
we
prepare
the
apparatus
of
practical
discussion
we
secure
the
means
of
arranging
the
factors
in
manageable
shape
and
of
deducing
from
them
with
precision
and
rapidity
a
practical
course
of
action
without
such
an
apparatus
no
two
men
can
even
think
on
the
same
line
much
less
can
they
ever
hope
to
detach
the
real
point
of
difference
that
divides
them
and
isolate
it
for
quiet
solution
in
our
own
case
this
view
of
the
value
of
strategical
theory
has
a
special
significance
and
one
far
wider
than
its
continental
enunciators
contemplated
for
a
maritime
empire
the
successful
conduct
of
war
will
often
turn
not
only
on
the
decisions
of
the
council
chamber
at
home
but
on
the
outcome
of
conferences
in
all
parts
of
the
world
between
squadronal
commanders
and
the
local
authorities
both
civil
and
military
and
even
between
of
adjacent
stations
in
time
of
war
or
of
preparation
for
war
in
which
the
empire
is
concerned
arrangements
must
always
be
based
to
an
exceptional
degree
on
the
mutual
relation
of
naval
military
and
political
considerations
the
line
of
mean
efficiency
though
indicated
from
home
must
be
worked
out
locally
and
worked
out
on
factors
of
which
no
one
service
is
master
conference
is
always
necessary
and
for
conference
to
succeed
there
must
be
a
common
vehicle
of
expression
and
a
common
plane
of
thought
it
is
for
this
essential
preparation
that
theoretical
study
alone
can
provide
and
herein
lies
its
practical
value
for
all
who
aspire
to
the
higher
responsibilities
of
the
imperial
service
so
great
indeed
is
the
value
of
abstract
strategical
study
from
this
point
of
view
that
it
is
necessary
to
guard
ourselves
against
so
far
from
claiming
for
their
science
more
than
the
possibilities
we
have
indicated
the
classical
strategists
insist
again
and
again
on
the
danger
of
seeking
from
it
what
it
can
not
give
they
even
repudiate
the
very
name
of
science
they
prefer
the
older
term
art
they
will
permit
no
laws
or
rules
such
laws
they
say
can
only
mislead
in
practice
for
the
friction
to
which
they
are
subject
from
the
incalculable
human
factors
alone
is
such
that
the
friction
is
stronger
than
the
law
it
is
an
old
adage
of
lawyers
that
nothing
is
so
misleading
as
a
legal
maxim
but
a
strategical
maxim
is
undoubtedly
and
in
every
way
less
to
be
trusted
in
action
what
then
it
will
be
asked
are
the
tangible
results
which
we
can
hope
to
attain
from
theory
if
all
on
which
we
have
to
build
is
so
indeterminate
how
are
any
practical
conclusions
to
be
reached
that
the
factors
are
infinitely
varied
and
difficult
to
determine
is
true
but
that
it
must
be
remembered
is
just
what
emphasises
the
necessity
of
reaching
such
firm
standpoints
as
are
attainable
the
vaguer
the
problem
to
be
solved
the
more
resolute
must
we
be
in
seeking
points
of
departure
from
which
we
can
begin
to
lay
a
course
keeping
always
an
eye
open
for
the
accidents
that
will
beset
us
and
being
always
alive
to
their
deflecting
influences
and
this
is
just
what
the
theoretical
study
of
strategy
can
do
it
can
at
least
determine
the
normal
by
careful
collation
of
past
events
it
becomes
clear
that
certain
lines
of
conduct
tend
normally
to
produce
certain
effects
that
wars
tend
to
take
certain
forms
each
with
a
marked
idiosyncrasy
that
these
forms
are
normally
related
to
the
object
of
the
war
and
to
its
value
to
one
or
both
belligerents
that
a
system
of
operations
which
suits
one
form
may
not
be
that
best
suited
to
another
we
can
even
go
further
by
pursuing
an
historical
and
comparative
method
we
can
detect
that
even
the
human
factor
is
not
quite
indeterminable
we
can
assert
that
certain
situations
will
normally
produce
whether
in
ourselves
or
in
our
adversaries
certain
moral
states
on
which
we
may
calculate
having
determined
the
normal
we
are
at
once
in
a
stronger
position
any
proposal
can
be
compared
with
it
and
we
can
proceed
to
discuss
clearly
the
weight
of
the
factors
which
prompt
us
to
depart
from
the
normal
every
case
must
be
judged
on
its
merits
but
without
a
normal
to
work
from
we
can
not
form
any
real
judgment
at
all
we
can
only
guess
every
case
will
assuredly
depart
from
the
normal
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
and
it
is
equally
certain
that
the
greatest
successes
in
war
have
been
the
boldest
departures
from
the
normal
but
for
the
most
part
they
have
been
departures
made
with
open
eyes
by
geniuses
who
could
perceive
in
the
accidents
of
the
case
a
just
reason
for
the
departure
take
an
analogous
example
and
the
province
of
strategical
theory
becomes
clear
at
once
navigation
and
the
parts
of
seamanship
that
belong
to
it
have
to
deal
with
phenomena
as
varied
and
unreliable
as
those
of
the
conduct
of
war
together
they
form
an
art
which
depends
quite
as
much
as
generalship
on
the
judgment
of
individuals
the
law
of
storms
and
tides
of
winds
and
currents
and
the
whole
of
meteorology
are
subject
to
infinite
and
incalculable
deflections
and
yet
who
will
deny
nowadays
that
by
the
theoretical
study
of
such
things
the
seaman
art
has
gained
in
coherence
and
strength
such
study
will
not
by
itself
make
a
seaman
or
a
navigator
but
without
it
no
seaman
or
navigator
can
nowadays
pretend
to
the
name
because
storms
do
not
always
behave
in
the
same
way
because
currents
are
erratic
will
the
most
practical
seaman
deny
that
the
study
of
the
normal
conditions
are
useless
to
him
in
his
practical
decisions
if
then
the
theoretical
study
of
strategy
be
approached
in
this
way
if
that
is
it
be
regarded
not
as
a
substitute
for
judgment
and
experience
but
as
a
means
of
fertilising
both
it
can
do
no
man
harm
individual
thought
and
will
remain
the
masters
and
remain
the
guides
to
point
the
general
direction
when
the
mass
of
facts
begins
to
grow
bewildering
theory
will
warn
us
the
moment
we
begin
to
leave
the
beaten
track
and
enable
us
to
decide
with
open
eyes
whether
the
divergence
is
necessary
or
justifiable
above
all
when
men
assemble
in
council
it
will
hold
discussion
to
the
essential
lines
and
help
to
keep
side
issues
in
their
place
but
beyond
all
this
there
lies
in
the
theory
of
war
yet
another
element
of
peculiar
value
to
a
maritime
empire
we
are
accustomed
partly
for
convenience
and
partly
from
lack
of
a
scientific
habit
of
thought
to
speak
of
naval
strategy
and
military
strategy
as
though
they
were
distinct
branches
of
knowledge
which
had
no
common
ground
it
is
the
theory
of
war
which
brings
out
their
intimate
relation
it
reveals
that
embracing
them
both
is
a
larger
strategy
which
regards
the
fleet
and
army
as
one
weapon
which
their
action
and
indicates
the
lines
on
which
each
must
move
to
realise
the
full
power
of
both
it
will
direct
us
to
assign
to
each
its
proper
function
in
a
plan
of
war
it
will
enable
each
service
to
realise
the
better
the
limitations
and
the
possibilities
of
the
function
with
which
it
is
charged
and
how
and
when
its
own
necessities
must
give
way
to
a
higher
or
more
pressing
need
of
the
other
it
discloses
in
short
that
naval
strategy
is
not
a
thing
by
itself
that
its
problems
can
seldom
or
never
be
solved
on
naval
considerations
alone
but
that
it
is
only
a
part
of
maritime
strategy
the
higher
learning
which
teaches
us
that
for
a
maritime
state
to
make
successful
war
and
to
realise
her
special
strength
army
and
navy
must
be
used
and
thought
of
as
instruments
no
less
intimately
connected
than
are
the
three
arms
ashore
it
is
for
these
reasons
that
it
is
of
little
use
to
approach
naval
strategy
except
through
the
theory
of
war
without
such
theory
we
can
never
really
understand
its
scope
or
meaning
nor
can
we
hope
to
grasp
the
forces
which
most
profoundly
affect
its
conclusions
part
one
theory
of
war
chapter
one
the
theory
of
war
the
last
thing
that
an
explorer
arrives
at
is
a
complete
map
that
will
cover
the
whole
ground
he
has
travelled
but
for
those
who
come
after
him
and
would
profit
by
and
extend
his
knowledge
his
map
is
the
first
thing
with
which
they
will
begin
so
it
is
with
strategy
before
we
start
upon
its
study
we
seek
a
chart
which
will
show
us
at
a
glance
what
exactly
is
the
ground
we
have
to
cover
and
what
are
the
leading
features
which
determine
its
form
and
general
characteristics
such
a
chart
a
theory
of
war
alone
can
provide
it
is
for
this
reason
that
in
the
study
of
war
we
must
get
our
theory
clear
before
we
can
venture
in
search
of
practical
conclusions
so
great
is
the
complexity
of
war
that
without
such
a
guide
we
are
sure
to
go
astray
amidst
the
bewildering
multiplicity
of
tracks
and
obstacles
that
meet
us
at
every
step
if
for
continental
strategy
its
value
has
been
proved
abundantly
then
for
maritime
strategy
where
the
conditions
are
far
more
complex
the
need
of
it
is
even
greater
by
maritime
strategy
we
mean
the
principles
which
govern
a
war
in
which
the
sea
is
a
substantial
factor
naval
strategy
is
but
that
part
of
it
which
determines
the
movements
of
the
fleet
when
maritime
strategy
has
determined
what
part
the
fleet
must
play
in
relation
to
the
action
of
the
land
forces
for
it
scarcely
needs
saying
that
it
is
almost
impossible
that
a
war
can
be
decided
by
naval
action
alone
unaided
naval
pressure
can
only
work
by
a
process
of
exhaustion
its
effects
must
always
be
slow
and
so
galling
both
to
our
own
commercial
community
and
to
neutrals
that
the
tendency
is
always
to
accept
terms
of
peace
that
are
far
from
conclusive
for
a
firm
decision
a
quicker
and
more
drastic
form
of
pressure
is
required
since
men
live
upon
the
land
and
not
upon
the
sea
great
issues
between
nations
at
war
have
always
been
decided
except
in
the
rarest
cases
either
by
what
your
army
can
do
against
your
enemy
territory
and
national
life
or
else
by
the
fear
of
what
the
fleet
makes
it
possible
for
your
army
to
do
the
paramount
concern
then
of
maritime
strategy
is
to
determine
the
mutual
relations
of
your
army
and
navy
in
a
plan
of
war
when
this
is
done
and
not
till
then
naval
strategy
can
begin
to
work
out
the
manner
in
which
the
fleet
can
best
discharge
the
function
assigned
to
it
the
problem
of
such
is
one
that
is
susceptible
of
widely
varying
solutions
it
may
be
that
the
command
of
the
sea
is
of
so
urgent
an
importance
that
the
army
will
have
to
devote
itself
to
assisting
the
fleet
in
its
special
task
before
it
can
act
directly
against
the
territory
and
land
forces
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
that
the
immediate
duty
of
the
fleet
will
be
to
forward
military
action
ashore
before
it
is
free
to
devote
itself
to
the
destruction
of
the
fleets
the
crude
maxims
as
to
primary
objects
which
seem
to
have
served
well
enough
in
continental
warfare
have
never
worked
so
clearly
where
the
sea
enters
seriously
into
a
war
in
such
cases
it
will
not
suffice
to
say
the
primary
object
of
the
army
is
to
destroy
the
enemy
army
or
that
of
the
fleet
to
destroy
the
enemy
fleet
the
delicate
interactions
of
the
land
and
sea
factors
produce
conditions
too
intricate
for
such
blunt
solutions
even
the
initial
equations
they
present
are
too
complex
to
be
reduced
by
the
simple
application
of
maxims
their
right
handling
depends
upon
the
broadest
and
most
fundamental
principles
of
war
and
it
is
as
a
standpoint
from
which
to
get
a
clear
and
unobstructed
view
of
the
factors
in
their
true
relations
that
a
theory
of
war
has
perhaps
its
highest
value
the
theory
which
now
holds
the
field
is
that
war
in
a
fundamental
sense
is
a
continuation
of
policy
by
other
means
the
process
by
which
the
continental
strategists
arrived
at
it
involved
some
hard
philosophical
reasoning
practical
and
experienced
veterans
as
they
were
their
method
is
not
one
that
works
easily
with
our
own
habit
of
thought
it
will
be
well
therefore
to
endeavour
first
to
present
their
conclusions
in
a
concrete
form
which
will
make
the
pith
of
the
matter
intelligible
at
once
take
now
the
ordinary
case
of
a
naval
or
military
staff
being
asked
to
prepare
a
war
plan
against
a
certain
state
and
to
advise
what
means
it
will
require
to
any
one
who
has
considered
such
matters
it
is
obvious
the
reply
must
be
another
question
what
will
the
war
be
about
without
a
definite
answer
or
alternative
answers
to
that
question
a
staff
can
scarcely
do
more
than
engage
in
making
such
forces
as
the
country
can
afford
as
efficient
as
possible
before
they
take
any
sure
step
further
they
must
know
many
things
they
must
know
whether
they
are
expected
to
take
something
from
the
enemy
or
to
prevent
his
taking
something
either
from
us
or
from
some
other
state
if
from
some
other
state
the
measures
to
be
taken
will
depend
on
its
geographical
situation
and
on
its
relative
strength
by
land
and
sea
even
when
the
object
is
clear
it
will
be
necessary
to
know
how
much
value
the
enemy
attaches
to
it
is
it
one
for
which
he
will
be
likely
to
fight
to
the
death
or
one
which
he
will
abandon
in
the
face
of
comparatively
slight
resistance
if
the
former
we
can
not
hope
to
succeed
without
entirely
overthrowing
his
powers
of
resistance
if
the
latter
it
will
suffice
as
it
often
has
sufficed
to
aim
at
something
less
costly
and
hazardous
and
better
within
our
means
all
these
are
questions
which
lie
in
the
lap
of
ministers
charged
with
the
foreign
policy
of
the
country
and
before
the
staff
can
proceed
with
a
war
plan
they
must
be
answered
by
ministers
in
short
the
staff
must
ask
of
them
what
is
the
policy
which
your
diplomacy
is
pursuing
and
where
and
why
do
you
expect
it
to
break
down
and
force
you
to
take
up
arms
the
staff
has
to
carry
on
in
fact
when
diplomacy
has
failed
to
achieve
the
object
in
view
and
the
method
they
will
use
will
depend
on
the
nature
of
that
object
so
we
arrive
crudely
at
our
theory
that
war
is
a
continuation
of
policy
a
form
of
political
intercourse
in
which
we
fight
battles
instead
of
writing
notes
it
was
this
theory
simple
and
even
meaningless
as
it
appears
at
first
sight
that
gave
the
key
to
the
practical
work
of
framing
a
modern
war
plan
and
revolutionised
the
study
of
strategy
it
was
not
till
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
such
a
theory
was
arrived
at
for
centuries
men
had
written
on
the
art
of
war
but
for
want
of
a
working
theory
their
labours
as
a
whole
had
been
unscientific
concerned
for
the
most
part
with
the
discussion
of
passing
fashions
and
the
elaboration
of
platitudes
much
good
work
it
is
true
was
done
on
details
but
no
broad
outlook
had
been
obtained
to
enable
us
to
determine
their
relation
to
the
fundamental
constants
of
the
subject
no
standpoint
had
been
found
from
which
we
could
readily
detach
such
constants
from
what
was
merely
accidental
the
result
was
a
tendency
to
argue
too
exclusively
from
the
latest
examples
and
to
become
entangled
in
erroneous
thought
by
trying
to
apply
the
methods
which
had
attained
the
last
success
to
war
as
a
whole
there
was
no
means
of
determining
how
far
the
particular
success
was
due
to
special
conditions
and
how
far
it
was
due
to
factors
common
to
all
wars
it
was
the
revolutionary
and
napoleonic
wars
coinciding
as
they
did
with
a
period
of
philosophic
activity
that
revealed
the
shallowness
and
empirical
nature
of
all
that
had
been
done
up
to
that
time
napoleon
methods
appeared
to
his
contemporaries
to
have
produced
so
strenuous
a
revolution
in
the
conduct
of
land
warfare
that
it
assumed
a
wholly
new
aspect
and
it
was
obvious
that
those
conceptions
which
had
sufficed
previously
had
become
inadequate
as
a
basis
of
sound
study
war
on
land
seemed
to
have
changed
from
a
calculated
affair
of
thrust
and
parry
between
standing
armies
to
a
headlong
rush
of
one
nation
in
arms
upon
another
each
thirsting
for
the
other
life
and
resolved
to
have
it
or
perish
in
the
attempt
men
felt
themselves
faced
with
a
manifestation
of
human
energy
which
had
had
no
counterpart
at
least
in
civilised
times
the
assumption
was
not
entirely
true
for
although
the
continent
had
never
before
adopted
the
methods
in
question
our
own
country
was
no
stranger
to
them
either
on
sea
or
land
as
we
shall
see
our
own
revolution
in
the
seventeenth
century
had
produced
strenuous
methods
of
making
war
which
were
closely
related
to
those
which
napoleon
took
over
from
the
french
revolutionary
leaders
a
more
philosophic
outlook
might
have
suggested
that
the
phenomenon
was
not
really
exceptional
but
rather
the
natural
outcome
of
popular
energy
inspired
by
a
stirring
political
ideal
but
the
british
precedent
was
forgotten
and
so
profound
was
the
disturbance
caused
by
the
new
french
methods
that
its
effects
are
with
us
still
we
are
in
fact
still
dominated
by
the
idea
that
since
the
napoleonic
era
war
has
been
essentially
a
different
thing
our
teachers
incline
to
insist
that
there
is
now
only
one
way
of
making
war
and
that
is
napoleon
way
ignoring
the
fact
that
he
failed
in
the
end
they
brand
as
heresy
the
bare
suggestion
that
there
may
be
other
ways
and
not
content
with
assuming
that
his
system
will
fit
all
land
wars
however
much
their
natures
and
objects
may
differ
they
would
force
naval
warfare
into
the
same
uniform
under
the
impression
apparently
that
they
are
thereby
making
it
presentable
and
giving
it
some
new
force
seeing
how
cramping
the
napoleonic
idea
has
become
it
will
be
convenient
before
going
further
to
determine
its
special
characteristics
exactly
but
that
is
no
easy
matter
the
moment
we
approach
it
in
a
critical
spirit
it
begins
to
grow
nebulous
and
very
difficult
to
define
we
can
dimly
make
out
four
distinct
ideas
mingled
in
the
current
notion
first
there
is
the
idea
of
making
war
not
merely
with
a
professional
standing
army
but
with
the
whole
armed
nation
a
conception
which
of
course
was
not
really
napoleon
it
was
inherited
by
him
from
the
revolution
but
was
in
fact
far
older
it
was
but
a
revival
of
the
universal
practice
which
obtained
in
the
barbaric
stages
of
social
development
and
which
every
civilisation
in
turn
had
abandoned
as
economically
unsound
and
subversive
of
specialisation
in
citizenship
the
results
of
the
abandonment
were
sometimes
good
and
sometimes
bad
but
the
determining
conditions
have
been
studied
as
yet
too
imperfectly
to
justify
any
broad
generalisation
secondly
there
is
the
idea
of
strenuous
and
persistent
effort
not
resting
to
secure
each
minor
advantage
but
pressing
the
enemy
without
pause
or
rest
till
he
is
utterly
overthrown
an
idea
in
which
cromwell
had
anticipated
napoleon
by
a
century
and
a
half
scarcely
distinguishable
from
this
is
a
third
idea
that
of
taking
the
offensive
in
which
there
was
really
nothing
new
at
all
since
its
advantages
had
always
been
understood
and
frederick
the
great
had
pressed
it
to
extremity
with
little
less
daring
than
napoleon
himself
nay
even
to
culpable
rashness
as
the
highest
exponents
of
the
napoleonic
idea
admit
finally
there
is
the
notion
of
making
the
armed
forces
of
the
enemy
and
not
his
territory
or
any
part
of
it
your
main
objective
this
perhaps
is
regarded
as
the
strongest
characteristic
of
napoleon
methods
and
yet
even
here
we
are
confused
by
the
fact
that
undoubtedly
on
some
very
important
occasions
the
austerlitz
campaign
for
example
napoleon
made
the
hostile
capital
his
objective
as
though
he
believed
its
occupation
was
the
most
effective
step
towards
the
overthrow
of
the
enemy
power
and
will
to
resist
he
certainly
did
not
make
the
enemy
main
army
his
primary
objective
for
their
main
army
was
not
mack
but
that
of
the
archduke
charles
on
the
whole
then
when
men
speak
of
the
napoleonic
system
they
seem
to
include
two
groups
of
ideas
one
which
comprises
the
conception
of
war
made
with
the
whole
force
of
the
nation
the
other
a
group
which
includes
the
cromwellian
idea
of
persistent
effort
frederick
preference
for
the
offensive
at
almost
any
risk
and
finally
the
idea
of
the
enemy
armed
forces
as
the
main
objective
which
was
also
cromwell
it
is
the
combination
of
these
by
no
means
original
or
very
distinct
ideas
that
we
are
told
has
brought
about
so
entire
a
change
in
the
conduct
of
war
that
it
has
become
altogether
a
different
thing
it
is
unnecessary
for
our
purpose
to
consider
how
far
the
facts
seem
to
support
such
a
conclusion
for
in
the
inherent
nature
of
things
it
must
be
radically
unsound
neither
war
nor
anything
else
can
change
in
its
essentials
if
it
appears
to
do
so
it
is
because
we
are
still
mistaking
accidents
for
essentials
and
this
is
exactly
how
it
struck
the
acutest
thinkers
of
napoleonic
times
for
a
while
it
is
true
they
were
bewildered
but
so
soon
as
they
had
had
time
to
clear
their
heads
from
the
din
of
the
struggle
in
which
they
had
taken
part
they
began
to
see
that
the
new
phenomena
were
but
accidents
after
all
they
perceived
that
napoleon
methods
which
had
taken
the
world
by
storm
had
met
with
success
in
wars
of
a
certain
nature
only
and
that
when
he
tried
to
extend
those
methods
to
other
natures
of
war
he
had
met
with
failure
and
even
disaster
how
was
this
to
be
explained
what
theory
for
instance
would
cover
napoleon
successes
in
germany
and
italy
as
well
as
his
failures
in
spain
and
russia
if
the
whole
conception
of
war
had
changed
how
could
you
account
for
the
success
of
england
who
had
not
changed
her
methods
to
us
the
answer
to
these
questions
is
of
living
and
infinite
importance
our
standpoint
remains
still
unchanged
is
there
anything
inherent
in
the
conception
of
war
that
justifies
that
attitude
in
our
case
are
we
entitled
to
expect
from
it
again
the
same
success
it
met
with
in
the
past
the
first
man
to
enunciate
a
theory
which
would
explain
the
phenomena
of
the
napoleonic
era
and
them
with
previous
history
was
general
carl
von
clausewitz
a
man
whose
arduous
service
on
the
staff
and
the
actual
work
of
higher
instruction
had
taught
the
necessity
of
systematising
the
study
of
his
profession
he
was
no
mere
professor
but
a
soldier
bred
in
the
severest
school
of
war
the
pupil
and
friend
of
sharnhorst
and
gneisenau
he
had
served
on
the
staff
of
blücher
in
he
had
been
chief
of
the
staff
to
wallmoden
in
his
campaign
against
davoust
on
the
lower
elbe
and
also
to
the
third
prussian
army
corps
in
the
campaign
of
thereafter
for
more
than
ten
years
he
was
director
of
the
general
academy
of
war
at
berlin
and
died
in
as
chief
of
the
staff
to
marshal
gneisenau
for
the
fifty
years
that
followed
his
death
his
theories
and
system
were
as
he
expected
they
would
be
attacked
from
all
sides
yet
his
work
is
more
firmly
established
than
ever
as
the
necessary
basis
of
all
strategical
thought
and
above
all
in
the
blood
and
iron
school
of
germany
the
process
by
which
he
reached
his
famous
theory
can
be
followed
in
his
classical
work
and
the
regarding
it
which
he
left
behind
him
in
accordance
with
the
philosophic
fashion
of
his
time
he
began
by
trying
to
formulate
an
abstract
idea
of
war
the
definition
he
started
with
was
that
war
is
an
act
of
violence
to
compel
our
opponent
to
do
our
will
but
that
act
of
violence
was
not
merely
the
shock
of
armies
as
montecuccoli
had
defined
it
a
century
and
a
half
before
if
the
abstract
idea
of
war
be
followed
to
its
logical
conclusion
the
act
of
violence
must
be
performed
with
the
whole
of
the
means
at
our
disposal
and
with
the
utmost
exertion
of
our
will
consequently
we
get
the
conception
of
two
armed
nations
flinging
themselves
one
upon
the
other
and
continuing
the
struggle
with
the
utmost
strength
and
energy
they
can
command
till
one
or
other
is
no
longer
capable
of
resistance
this
clausewitz
called
absolute
war
but
his
practical
experience
and
ripe
study
of
history
told
him
at
once
that
real
war
was
something
radically
different
it
was
true
as
he
said
that
napoleon
methods
had
approximated
to
the
absolute
and
had
given
some
colour
to
the
use
of
the
absolute
idea
as
a
working
theory
but
shall
we
he
acutely
asks
rest
satisfied
with
this
idea
and
judge
all
wars
by
it
however
much
they
may
differ
from
it
shall
we
deduce
from
it
all
the
requirements
of
theory
we
must
decide
the
point
for
we
can
say
nothing
trustworthy
about
a
war
plan
until
we
have
made
up
our
minds
whether
war
should
only
be
of
this
kind
or
whether
it
may
be
of
another
kind
he
saw
at
once
that
a
theory
formed
upon
the
abstract
or
absolute
idea
of
war
would
not
cover
the
ground
and
therefore
failed
to
give
what
was
required
for
practical
purposes
it
would
exclude
almost
the
whole
of
war
from
alexander
time
to
napoleon
and
what
guarantee
was
there
that
the
next
war
would
confirm
to
the
napoleonic
type
and
accommodate
itself
to
the
abstract
theory
this
theory
he
says
is
still
quite
powerless
against
the
force
of
circumstances
and
so
it
proved
for
the
wars
of
the
middle
nineteenth
century
did
in
fact
revert
to
the
type
in
short
clausewitz
difficulty
in
adopting
his
abstract
theory
as
a
working
rule
was
that
his
practical
mind
could
not
forget
that
war
had
not
begun
with
the
revolutionary
era
nor
was
it
likely
to
end
with
it
if
that
era
had
changed
the
conduct
of
war
it
must
be
presumed
that
war
would
change
again
with
other
times
and
other
conditions
a
theory
of
war
which
did
not
allow
for
this
and
did
not
cover
all
that
had
gone
before
was
no
theory
at
all
if
a
theory
of
war
was
to
be
of
any
use
as
a
practical
guide
it
must
cover
and
explain
not
only
the
extreme
manifestation
of
hostility
which
he
himself
had
witnessed
but
every
manifestation
that
had
occurred
in
the
past
or
was
likely
to
recur
in
the
future
it
was
in
casting
about
for
the
underlying
causes
of
the
oscillations
manifested
in
the
energy
and
intensity
of
hostile
relations
that
he
found
his
solution
his
experience
on
the
staff
and
his
study
of
the
inner
springs
of
war
told
him
it
was
never
in
fact
a
question
of
purely
military
endeavour
aiming
always
at
the
extreme
of
what
was
possible
or
expedient
from
a
purely
military
point
of
view
the
energy
exhibited
would
always
be
modified
by
political
considerations
and
by
the
depth
of
the
national
interest
in
the
object
of
the
war
he
saw
that
real
war
was
in
fact
an
international
relation
which
differed
from
other
international
relations
only
in
the
method
we
adopted
to
achieve
the
object
of
our
policy
so
it
was
he
arrived
at
his
famous
theory
that
war
is
a
mere
continuation
of
policy
by
other
means
at
first
sight
there
seems
little
enough
in
it
it
may
seem
perhaps
that
we
have
been
watching
a
mountain
in
labour
and
nothing
but
a
mouse
has
been
produced
but
it
is
only
upon
some
such
simple
even
obvious
formula
that
any
scientific
system
can
be
constructed
with
safety
we
have
only
to
develop
the
meaning
of
this
one
to
see
how
important
and
practical
are
the
guiding
lines
which
flow
from
it
with
the
conception
of
war
as
a
continuation
of
political
intercourse
before
us
it
is
clear
that
everything
which
lies
outside
the
political
conception
everything
that
is
which
is
strictly
peculiar
to
military
and
naval
operations
relates
merely
to
the
means
which
we
use
to
achieve
our
policy
consequently
the
first
desideratum
of
a
war
plan
is
that
the
means
adopted
must
conflict
as
little
as
possible
with
the
political
conditions
from
which
the
war
springs
in
practice
of
course
as
in
all
human
relations
there
will
be
a
compromise
between
the
means
and
the
end
between
the
political
and
the
military
exigencies
but
clausewitz
held
that
policy
must
always
be
the
master
the
officer
charged
with
the
conduct
of
the
war
may
of
course
demand
that
the
tendencies
and
views
of
policy
shall
not
be
incompatible
with
the
military
means
which
are
placed
at
his
disposal
but
however
strongly
this
demand
may
react
on
policy
in
particular
cases
military
action
must
still
be
regarded
only
as
a
manifestation
of
policy
it
must
never
supersede
policy
the
policy
is
always
the
object
war
is
only
the
means
by
which
we
obtain
the
object
and
the
means
must
always
keep
the
end
in
view
the
practical
importance
of
this
conception
will
now
become
clear
it
will
be
seen
to
afford
the
logical
or
theoretical
exposition
of
what
we
began
by
stating
in
its
purely
concrete
form
when
a
chief
of
staff
is
asked
for
a
war
plan
he
must
not
say
we
will
make
war
in
such
and
such
a
way
because
it
was
napoleon
or
moltke
way
he
will
ask
what
is
the
political
object
of
the
war
what
are
the
political
conditions
and
how
much
does
the
question
at
issue
mean
respectively
to
us
and
to
our
adversary
it
is
these
considerations
which
determine
the
nature
of
the
war
this
primordial
question
settled
he
will
be
in
a
position
to
say
whether
the
war
is
of
the
same
nature
as
those
in
which
napoleon
and
moltke
methods
were
successful
or
whether
it
is
of
another
nature
in
which
those
methods
failed
he
will
then
design
and
offer
a
war
plan
not
because
it
has
the
of
this
or
that
great
master
of
war
but
because
it
is
one
that
has
been
proved
to
fit
the
kind
of
war
in
hand
to
assume
that
one
method
of
conducting
war
will
suit
all
kinds
of
war
is
to
fall
a
victim
to
abstract
theory
and
not
to
be
a
prophet
of
reality
as
the
narrowest
disciples
of
the
napoleonic
school
are
inclined
to
see
themselves
hence
says
clausewitz
the
first
the
greatest
and
most
critical
decision
upon
which
the
statesman
and
the
general
have
to
exercise
their
judgment
is
to
determine
the
nature
of
the
war
to
be
sure
they
do
not
mistake
it
for
something
nor
seek
to
make
of
it
something
which
from
its
inherent
conditions
it
can
never
be
this
he
declares
is
the
first
and
the
most
of
all
strategical
questions
the
first
value
then
of
his
theory
of
war
is
that
it
gives
a
clear
line
on
which
we
may
proceed
to
determine
the
nature
of
a
war
in
which
we
are
about
to
engage
and
to
ensure
that
we
do
not
try
to
apply
to
one
nature
of
war
any
particular
course
of
operations
simply
because
they
have
proved
successful
in
another
nature
of
war
it
is
only
he
insists
by
regarding
war
not
as
an
independent
thing
but
as
a
political
instrument
that
we
can
read
aright
the
lessons
of
history
and
understand
for
our
practical
guidance
how
wars
must
differ
in
character
according
to
the
nature
of
the
motives
and
circumstances
from
which
they
proceed
this
conception
he
claims
is
the
first
ray
of
light
to
guide
us
to
a
true
theory
of
war
and
thereby
enable
us
to
classify
wars
and
distinguish
them
one
from
another
jomini
his
great
contemporary
and
rival
though
proceeding
by
a
less
philosophical
but
no
less
lucid
method
entirely
endorses
this
view
a
swiss
soldier
of
fortune
his
experience
was
much
the
same
as
that
of
clausewitz
it
was
obtained
mainly
on
the
staff
of
marshal
ney
and
subsequently
on
the
russian
headquarter
staff
he
reached
no
definite
theory
of
war
but
his
fundamental
conclusions
were
the
same
the
first
chapter
of
his
final
work
de
de
la
is
devoted
to
la
politique
de
la
guerre
in
it
he
classifies
wars
into
nine
categories
according
to
their
political
object
and
he
lays
it
down
as
a
base
proposition
that
these
different
kinds
of
war
will
have
more
or
less
influence
on
the
nature
of
the
operations
which
will
be
demanded
to
attain
the
end
in
view
on
the
amount
of
energy
that
must
be
put
forth
and
on
the
extent
of
the
undertakings
in
which
we
must
engage
there
will
he
adds
be
a
great
difference
in
the
operations
according
to
the
risks
we
have
to
run
both
men
therefore
though
on
details
of
means
they
were
often
widely
opposed
are
agreed
that
the
fundamental
conception
of
war
is
political
both
of
course
agree
that
if
we
isolate
in
our
mind
the
forces
engaged
in
any
theatre
of
war
the
abstract
conception
reappears
so
far
as
those
forces
are
concerned
war
is
a
question
of
fighting
in
which
each
belligerent
should
endeavour
by
all
means
at
his
command
and
with
all
his
energy
to
destroy
the
other
but
even
so
they
may
find
that
certain
means
are
barred
to
them
for
political
reasons
and
at
any
moment
the
fortune
of
war
or
a
development
of
the
political
conditions
with
which
it
is
entangled
may
throw
them
back
upon
the
fundamental
political
theory
that
theory
it
will
be
unprofitable
to
labour
further
at
this
point
let
it
suffice
for
the
present
to
mark
that
it
gives
us
a
conception
of
war
as
an
exertion
of
violence
to
secure
a
political
end
which
we
desire
to
attain
and
that
from
this
broad
and
simple
formula
we
are
able
to
deduce
at
once
that
wars
will
vary
according
to
the
nature
of
the
end
and
the
intensity
of
our
desire
to
attain
it
here
we
may
leave
it
to
gather
force
and
coherence
as
we
examine
the
practical
considerations
which
are
its
immediate
outcome
chapter
two
natures
of
wars
offensive
and
defensive
having
determined
that
wars
must
vary
in
character
according
to
the
nature
and
importance
of
their
object
we
are
faced
with
the
difficulty
that
the
variations
will
be
of
infinite
number
and
of
all
degrees
of
distinction
so
complex
indeed
is
the
graduation
presented
that
at
first
sight
it
appears
scarcely
possible
to
make
it
the
basis
of
practical
study
but
on
further
examination
it
will
be
seen
that
by
applying
the
usual
analytical
method
the
whole
subject
is
susceptible
of
much
simplification
we
must
in
short
attempt
to
reach
some
system
of
classification
that
is
we
must
see
if
it
is
not
possible
to
group
the
variations
into
some
categories
with
a
subject
so
complex
and
intangible
the
grouping
must
of
course
be
to
some
extent
arbitrary
and
in
some
places
the
lines
of
demarcation
will
be
shadowy
but
if
classification
has
been
found
possible
and
helpful
in
zoology
or
botany
with
the
infinite
and
minute
individual
variations
with
which
they
have
to
deal
it
should
be
no
less
possible
and
helpful
in
the
study
of
war
the
political
theory
of
war
will
at
any
rate
give
us
two
broad
and
classifications
the
first
is
simple
and
well
known
depending
on
whether
the
political
object
of
the
war
is
positive
or
negative
if
it
be
positive
that
is
if
our
aim
is
to
wrest
something
from
the
enemy
then
our
war
in
its
main
lines
will
be
offensive
if
on
the
other
hand
our
aim
be
negative
and
we
simply
seek
to
prevent
the
enemy
wresting
some
advantage
to
our
detriment
then
the
war
in
its
general
direction
will
be
defensive
it
is
only
as
a
broad
conception
that
this
classification
has
value
though
it
fixes
the
general
trend
of
our
operations
it
will
not
in
itself
affect
their
character
for
a
maritime
power
at
least
it
is
obvious
that
this
must
be
so
for
in
any
circumstances
it
is
impossible
for
such
a
power
either
to
establish
its
defence
or
develop
fully
its
offence
without
securing
a
working
control
of
the
sea
by
aggressive
action
against
the
enemy
fleets
furthermore
we
have
always
found
that
however
strictly
our
aim
may
be
defensive
the
most
effective
means
of
securing
it
has
been
by
either
to
support
an
ally
directly
or
to
deprive
our
enemy
of
his
colonial
possessions
neither
category
then
excludes
the
use
of
offensive
operations
nor
the
idea
of
overthrowing
our
enemy
so
far
as
is
necessary
to
gain
our
end
in
neither
case
does
the
conception
lead
us
eventually
to
any
other
objective
than
the
enemy
armed
forces
and
particularly
his
naval
forces
the
only
real
difference
is
this
that
if
our
object
be
positive
our
general
plan
must
be
offensive
and
we
should
at
least
open
with
a
true
offensive
movement
whereas
if
our
object
be
negative
our
general
plan
will
be
preventive
and
we
may
bide
our
time
for
our
to
this
extent
our
action
must
always
tend
to
the
offensive
for
is
the
soul
of
defence
defence
is
not
a
passive
attitude
for
that
is
the
negation
of
war
rightly
conceived
it
is
an
attitude
of
alert
expectation
we
wait
for
the
moment
when
the
enemy
shall
expose
himself
to
a
the
success
of
which
will
so
far
cripple
him
as
to
render
us
relatively
strong
enough
to
pass
to
the
offensive
ourselves
from
these
considerations
it
will
appear
that
real
and
logical
as
the
classification
is
to
give
it
the
designation
offensive
and
defensive
is
objectionable
from
every
point
of
view
to
begin
with
it
does
not
emphasise
what
the
real
and
logical
distinction
is
it
suggests
that
the
basis
of
the
classification
is
not
so
much
a
difference
of
object
as
a
difference
in
the
means
employed
to
achieve
the
object
consequently
we
find
ourselves
continually
struggling
with
the
false
assumption
that
positive
war
means
using
attack
and
negative
war
being
content
with
defence
that
is
confusing
enough
but
a
second
objection
to
the
designation
is
far
more
serious
and
more
fertile
of
error
for
the
classification
offensive
and
defensive
implies
that
offensive
and
defensive
are
mutually
exclusive
ideas
whereas
the
truth
is
and
it
is
a
fundamental
truth
of
war
that
they
are
mutually
complementary
all
war
and
every
form
of
it
must
be
both
offensive
and
defensive
no
matter
how
clear
our
positive
aim
nor
how
high
our
offensive
spirit
we
can
not
develop
an
aggressive
line
of
strategy
to
the
full
without
the
support
of
the
defensive
on
all
but
the
main
lines
of
operation
in
tactics
it
is
the
same
the
most
convinced
devotee
of
attack
admits
the
spade
as
well
as
the
rifle
and
even
when
it
comes
to
men
and
material
we
know
that
without
a
certain
amount
of
protection
neither
ships
guns
nor
men
can
develop
their
utmost
energy
and
endurance
in
striking
power
there
is
never
in
fact
a
clean
choice
between
attack
and
defence
in
aggressive
operations
the
question
always
is
how
far
must
defence
enter
into
the
methods
we
employ
in
order
to
enable
us
to
do
the
utmost
within
our
resources
to
break
or
paralyse
the
strength
of
the
enemy
so
also
with
defence
even
in
its
most
legitimate
use
it
must
always
be
supplemented
by
attack
even
behind
the
walls
of
a
fortress
men
know
that
sooner
or
later
the
place
must
fall
unless
by
on
the
siege
works
or
communications
they
can
cripple
his
power
of
attack
it
would
seem
therefore
that
it
were
better
to
lay
aside
the
designation
offensive
and
defensive
altogether
and
substitute
the
terms
positive
and
negative
but
here
again
we
are
confronted
with
a
difficulty
there
have
been
many
wars
in
which
positive
methods
have
been
used
all
through
to
secure
a
negative
end
and
such
wars
will
not
sit
easily
in
either
class
for
instance
in
the
war
of
spanish
succession
our
object
was
mainly
to
prevent
the
mediterranean
becoming
a
french
lake
by
the
union
of
the
french
and
spanish
crowns
but
the
method
by
which
we
succeeded
in
achieving
our
end
was
to
seize
the
naval
positions
of
gibraltar
and
minorca
and
so
in
practice
our
method
was
positive
again
in
the
late
war
the
main
object
of
japan
was
to
prevent
korea
being
absorbed
by
russia
that
aim
was
preventive
and
negative
but
the
only
effective
way
of
securing
her
aim
was
to
take
korea
herself
and
so
for
her
the
war
was
in
practice
positive
on
the
other
hand
we
can
not
shut
our
eyes
to
the
fact
that
in
the
majority
of
wars
the
side
with
the
positive
object
has
acted
generally
on
the
offensive
and
the
other
generally
on
the
defensive
unpractical
therefore
as
the
distinction
seems
to
be
it
is
impossible
to
dismiss
it
without
inquiring
why
this
was
so
and
it
is
in
this
inquiry
that
the
practical
results
of
the
classification
will
be
found
to
lie
that
is
it
forces
us
to
analyse
the
comparative
advantages
of
offence
and
defence
a
clear
apprehension
of
their
relative
possibilities
is
the
corner
stone
of
strategical
study
now
the
advantages
of
the
offensive
are
patent
and
admitted
it
is
only
the
offensive
that
can
produce
positive
results
while
the
strength
and
energy
which
are
born
of
the
moral
stimulation
of
attack
are
of
a
practical
value
that
outweighs
almost
every
other
consideration
every
man
of
spirit
would
desire
to
use
the
offensive
whether
his
object
were
positive
or
negative
and
yet
there
are
a
number
of
cases
in
which
some
of
the
most
energetic
masters
of
war
have
chosen
the
defensive
and
chosen
with
success
they
have
chosen
it
when
they
have
found
themselves
inferior
in
physical
force
to
their
enemy
and
when
they
believed
that
no
amount
of
aggressive
spirit
could
redress
that
inferiority
obviously
then
for
all
the
inferiority
of
the
defensive
as
a
drastic
form
of
war
it
must
have
some
inherent
advantage
which
the
offensive
does
not
enjoy
in
war
we
adopt
every
method
for
which
we
have
sufficient
strength
if
then
we
adopt
the
less
desirable
method
of
defence
it
must
be
either
that
we
have
not
sufficient
strength
for
offence
or
that
the
defence
gives
us
some
special
strength
for
the
attainment
of
our
object
what
then
are
these
elements
of
strength
it
is
very
necessary
to
inquire
not
only
that
we
may
know
that
if
for
a
time
we
are
forced
back
upon
the
defensive
all
is
not
lost
but
also
that
we
may
judge
with
how
much
daring
we
should
push
our
offensive
to
prevent
the
enemy
securing
the
advantages
of
defence
as
a
general
principle
we
all
know
that
possession
is
nine
points
of
the
law
it
is
easier
to
keep
money
in
our
pocket
than
to
take
it
from
another
man
if
one
man
would
rob
another
he
must
be
the
stronger
or
better
armed
unless
he
can
do
it
by
dexterity
or
stealth
and
there
lies
one
of
the
advantages
of
offence
the
side
which
takes
the
initiative
has
usually
the
better
chance
of
securing
advantage
by
dexterity
or
stealth
but
it
is
not
always
so
if
either
by
land
or
sea
we
can
take
a
defensive
position
so
good
that
it
can
not
be
turned
and
must
be
broken
down
before
our
enemy
can
reach
his
objective
then
the
advantage
of
dexterity
and
stealth
passes
to
us
we
choose
our
own
ground
for
the
trial
of
strength
we
are
hidden
on
familiar
ground
he
is
exposed
on
ground
that
is
less
familiar
we
can
lay
traps
and
prepare
surprises
by
when
he
is
most
dangerously
exposed
hence
the
paradoxical
doctrine
that
where
defence
is
sound
and
well
designed
the
advantage
of
surprise
is
against
the
attack
it
will
be
seen
therefore
that
whatever
advantages
lie
in
defence
they
depend
on
the
preservation
of
the
offensive
spirit
its
essence
is
the
waiting
deliberately
for
a
chance
to
strike
not
cowering
in
inactivity
defence
is
a
condition
of
restrained
activity
not
a
mere
condition
of
rest
its
real
weakness
is
that
if
unduly
prolonged
it
tends
to
deaden
the
spirit
of
offence
this
is
a
truth
so
vital
that
some
authorities
in
their
eagerness
to
enforce
it
have
travestied
it
into
the
misleading
maxim
that
attack
is
the
best
defence
hence
again
an
amateurish
notion
that
defence
is
always
stupid
or
pusillanimous
leading
always
to
defeat
and
that
what
is
called
the
military
spirit
means
nothing
but
taking
the
offensive
nothing
is
further
from
the
teaching
or
the
practice
of
the
best
masters
like
wellington
at
torres
vedras
they
all
at
times
used
the
defensive
till
the
elements
of
strength
inherent
in
that
form
of
war
as
opposed
to
the
exhausting
strain
inherent
in
the
form
that
they
had
fixed
upon
their
opponents
lifted
them
to
a
position
where
they
in
their
turn
were
relatively
strong
enough
to
use
the
more
exhausting
form
the
confusion
of
thought
which
has
led
to
the
misconceptions
about
defence
as
a
method
of
war
is
due
to
several
obvious
causes
from
a
general
defensive
attitude
have
been
regarded
as
a
true
offensive
as
for
instance
in
frederick
the
great
operations
or
in
admiral
tegetthoff
brilliant
counterstroke
at
lissa
or
our
own
operations
against
the
spanish
armada
again
the
defensive
has
acquired
an
ill
name
by
its
being
confused
with
a
wrongly
arrested
offensive
where
the
superior
power
with
the
positive
object
lacked
the
spirit
to
use
his
material
superiority
with
sufficient
activity
and
perseverance
against
such
a
power
an
inferior
enemy
can
always
redress
his
inferiority
by
passing
to
a
bold
and
quick
offensive
thus
acquiring
a
momentum
both
moral
and
physical
which
more
than
compensates
his
lack
of
weight
the
defensive
has
also
failed
by
the
choice
of
a
bad
position
which
the
enemy
was
able
to
turn
or
avoid
a
defensive
attitude
is
nothing
at
all
its
elements
of
strength
entirely
disappear
unless
it
is
such
that
the
enemy
must
break
it
down
by
force
before
he
can
reach
his
ultimate
objective
even
more
often
has
it
failed
when
the
belligerent
adopting
it
finding
he
has
no
available
defensive
position
which
will
bar
the
enemy
progress
attempts
to
guard
every
possible
line
of
attack
the
result
is
of
course
that
by
attenuating
his
force
he
only
accentuates
his
inferiority
clear
and
well
proven
as
these
considerations
are
for
land
warfare
their
application
to
the
sea
is
not
so
obvious
it
will
be
objected
that
at
sea
there
is
no
defensive
this
is
generally
true
for
tactics
but
even
so
not
universally
true
defensive
tactical
positions
are
possible
at
sea
as
in
defended
anchorages
these
were
always
a
reality
and
the
mine
has
increased
their
possibilities
in
the
latest
developments
of
naval
warfare
we
have
seen
the
japanese
at
the
elliot
islands
preparing
a
real
defensive
position
to
cover
the
landing
of
their
second
army
in
the
liaotung
peninsula
strategically
the
proposition
is
not
true
at
all
a
strategical
defensive
has
been
quite
as
common
at
sea
as
on
land
and
our
own
gravest
problems
have
often
been
how
to
break
down
such
an
attitude
when
our
enemy
assumed
it
it
usually
meant
that
the
enemy
remained
in
his
own
waters
and
near
his
own
bases
where
it
was
almost
impossible
for
us
to
attack
him
with
decisive
result
and
whence
he
always
threatened
us
with
counterattack
at
moments
of
exhaustion
as
the
dutch
did
at
sole
bay
and
in
the
medway
the
difficulty
of
dealing
decisively
with
an
enemy
who
adopted
this
course
was
realised
by
our
service
very
early
and
from
first
to
last
one
of
our
chief
preoccupations
was
to
prevent
the
enemy
availing
himself
of
this
device
and
to
force
him
to
fight
in
the
open
or
at
least
to
get
between
him
and
his
base
and
force
an
action
there
probably
the
most
remarkable
manifestation
of
the
advantages
that
may
be
derived
in
suitable
conditions
from
a
strategical
defensive
is
also
to
be
found
in
the
late
war
in
the
final
crisis
of
the
naval
struggle
the
japanese
fleet
was
able
to
take
advantage
of
a
defensive
attitude
in
its
own
waters
which
the
russian
baltic
fleet
would
have
to
break
down
to
attain
its
end
and
the
result
was
the
most
decisive
naval
victory
ever
recorded
the
deterrent
power
of
active
and
dexterous
operations
from
such
a
position
was
well
known
to
our
old
tradition
the
device
was
used
several
times
particularly
in
our
home
waters
to
prevent
a
fleet
which
for
the
time
we
were
locally
too
weak
to
destroy
from
carrying
out
the
work
assigned
to
it
a
typical
position
of
the
kind
was
off
scilly
and
it
was
proved
again
and
again
that
even
a
superior
fleet
could
not
hope
to
effect
anything
in
the
channel
till
the
fleet
off
scilly
had
been
brought
to
decisive
action
but
the
essence
of
the
device
was
the
preservation
of
the
aggressive
spirit
in
its
most
daring
form
for
success
it
depended
on
at
least
the
will
to
seize
every
occasion
for
bold
and
harassing
such
as
drake
and
his
colleagues
struck
at
the
armada
to
submit
to
blockade
in
order
to
engage
the
attention
of
a
superior
enemy
fleet
is
another
form
of
defensive
but
one
that
is
almost
wholly
evil
for
a
short
time
it
may
do
good
by
permitting
offensive
operations
elsewhere
which
otherwise
would
be
impossible
but
if
prolonged
it
will
sooner
or
later
destroy
the
spirit
of
your
force
and
render
it
incapable
of
effective
aggression
the
conclusion
then
is
that
although
for
the
practical
purpose
of
framing
or
appreciating
plans
of
war
the
classification
of
wars
into
offensive
and
defensive
is
of
little
use
a
clear
apprehension
of
the
inherent
relative
advantages
of
offence
and
defence
is
essential
we
must
realise
that
in
certain
cases
provided
always
we
preserve
the
aggressive
spirit
the
defensive
will
enable
an
inferior
force
to
achieve
points
when
the
offensive
would
probably
lead
to
its
destruction
but
the
elements
of
strength
depend
entirely
on
the
will
and
insight
to
deal
rapid
blows
in
the
enemy
unguarded
moments
so
soon
as
the
defensive
ceases
to
be
regarded
as
a
means
of
fostering
power
to
strike
and
of
reducing
the
enemy
power
of
attack
it
loses
all
its
strength
it
ceases
to
be
even
a
suspended
activity
and
anything
that
is
not
activity
is
not
war
with
these
general
indications
of
the
relative
advantages
of
offence
and
defence
we
may
leave
the
subject
for
the
present
it
is
possible
of
course
to
catalogue
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
each
form
but
any
such
bald
statement
without
concrete
examples
to
explain
the
meaning
must
always
appear
controversial
and
is
apt
to
mislead
it
is
better
to
reserve
their
fuller
consideration
till
we
come
to
deal
with
strategical
operations
and
are
able
to
note
their
actual
effect
upon
the
conduct
of
war
in
its
various
forms
leaving
therefore
our
first
classification
of
wars
into
offensive
and
defensive
we
will
pass
on
to
the
second
which
is
the
only
one
of
real
practical
importance
chapter
three
natures
of
wars
limited
and
unlimited
the
second
classification
to
which
we
are
led
by
the
political
theory
of
war
is
one
which
clausewitz
was
the
first
to
formulate
and
one
to
which
he
came
to
attach
the
highest
importance
it
becomes
necessary
therefore
to
examine
his
views
in
some
detail
not
because
there
is
any
need
to
regard
a
continental
soldier
however
distinguished
as
an
indispensable
authority
for
a
maritime
nation
the
reason
is
quite
the
reverse
it
is
because
a
careful
examination
of
his
doctrine
on
this
point
will
lay
open
what
are
the
radical
and
essential
differences
between
the
german
or
continental
school
of
strategy
and
the
british
or
maritime
school
that
is
our
own
traditional
school
which
too
many
writers
both
at
home
and
abroad
quietly
assume
to
have
no
existence
the
evil
tendency
of
that
assumption
can
not
be
too
strongly
emphasised
and
the
main
purpose
of
this
and
the
following
chapters
will
be
to
show
how
and
why
even
the
greatest
of
the
continental
strategists
fell
short
of
realising
fully
the
characteristic
conception
of
the
british
tradition
by
the
classification
in
question
clausewitz
distinguished
wars
into
those
with
a
limited
object
and
those
whose
object
was
unlimited
such
a
classification
was
entirely
characteristic
of
him
for
it
rested
not
alone
upon
the
material
nature
of
the
object
but
on
certain
moral
considerations
to
which
he
was
the
first
to
attach
their
real
value
in
war
other
writers
such
as
jomini
had
attempted
to
classify
wars
by
the
special
purpose
for
which
they
were
fought
but
clausewitz
long
course
of
study
convinced
him
that
such
a
distinction
was
unphilosophical
and
bore
no
just
relation
to
any
tenable
theory
of
war
whether
that
is
a
war
was
positive
or
negative
mattered
much
but
its
special
purpose
whether
for
instance
according
to
jomini
system
it
was
a
war
to
assert
rights
or
to
assist
an
ally
or
to
acquire
territory
mattered
not
at
all
whatever
the
object
the
vital
and
paramount
question
was
the
intensity
with
which
the
spirit
of
the
nation
was
absorbed
in
its
attainment
the
real
point
to
determine
in
approaching
any
war
plan
was
what
did
the
object
mean
to
the
two
belligerents
what
sacrifices
would
they
make
for
it
what
risks
were
they
prepared
to
run
it
was
thus
he
stated
his
view
the
smaller
the
sacrifice
we
demand
from
our
opponent
the
smaller
presumably
will
be
the
means
of
resistance
he
will
employ
and
the
smaller
his
means
the
smaller
will
ours
be
required
to
be
similarly
the
smaller
our
political
object
the
less
value
shall
we
set
upon
it
and
the
more
easily
we
shall
be
induced
to
abandon
it
thus
the
political
object
of
the
war
its
original
motive
will
not
only
determine
for
both
belligerents
reciprocally
the
aim
of
the
force
they
use
but
it
will
also
be
the
standard
of
the
intensity
of
the
efforts
they
will
make
so
he
concludes
there
may
be
wars
of
all
degrees
of
importance
and
energy
from
a
war
of
extermination
down
to
the
use
of
an
army
of
observation
so
also
in
the
naval
sphere
there
may
be
a
life
and
death
struggle
for
maritime
supremacy
or
hostilities
which
never
rise
beyond
a
blockade
such
a
view
of
the
subject
was
of
course
a
wide
departure
from
the
theory
of
absolute
war
on
which
clausewitz
had
started
working
under
that
theory
absolute
war
was
the
ideal
form
to
which
all
war
ought
to
attain
and
those
which
fell
short
of
it
were
imperfect
wars
cramped
by
a
lack
of
true
military
spirit
but
so
soon
as
he
had
seized
the
fact
that
in
actual
life
the
moral
factor
always
must
override
the
purely
military
factor
he
saw
that
he
had
been
working
on
too
narrow
a
basis
a
basis
that
was
purely
theoretical
in
that
it
ignored
the
human
factor
he
began
to
perceive
that
it
was
logically
unsound
to
assume
as
the
foundation
of
a
strategical
system
that
there
was
one
pattern
to
which
all
wars
ought
to
conform
in
the
light
of
his
full
and
final
apprehension
of
the
value
of
the
human
factor
he
saw
wars
falling
into
two
categories
each
of
which
would
legitimately
be
approached
in
a
radically
different
manner
and
not
necessarily
on
the
lines
of
absolute
war
he
saw
that
there
was
one
class
of
war
where
the
political
object
was
of
so
vital
an
importance
to
both
belligerents
that
they
would
tend
to
fight
to
the
utmost
limit
of
their
endurance
to
secure
it
but
there
was
another
class
where
the
object
was
of
less
importance
that
is
to
say
where
its
value
to
one
or
both
the
belligerents
was
not
so
great
as
to
be
worth
unlimited
sacrifices
of
blood
and
treasure
it
was
these
two
kinds
of
war
he
designated
provisionally
unlimited
and
limited
by
which
he
meant
not
that
you
were
not
to
exert
the
force
employed
with
all
the
vigour
you
could
develop
but
that
there
might
be
a
limit
beyond
which
it
would
be
bad
policy
to
spend
that
vigour
a
point
at
which
long
before
your
force
was
exhausted
or
even
fully
developed
it
would
be
wiser
to
abandon
your
object
rather
than
to
spend
more
upon
it
this
distinction
it
is
very
necessary
to
grasp
quite
clearly
for
it
is
often
superficially
confused
with
the
distinction
already
referred
to
which
clausewitz
drew
in
the
earlier
part
of
his
work
that
is
the
distinction
between
what
he
called
the
character
of
modern
war
and
the
character
of
the
wars
which
preceded
the
napoleonic
era
it
will
be
remembered
he
insisted
that
the
wars
of
his
own
time
had
been
wars
between
armed
nations
with
a
tendency
to
throw
the
whole
weight
of
the
nation
into
the
fighting
line
whereas
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
wars
were
waged
by
standing
armies
and
not
by
the
whole
nation
in
arms
the
distinction
of
course
is
real
and
of
consequences
but
it
has
no
relation
to
the
distinction
between
limited
and
unlimited
war
war
may
be
waged
on
the
napoleonic
system
either
for
a
limited
or
an
unlimited
object
a
modern
instance
will
serve
to
clear
the
field
the
recent
war
was
fought
for
a
limited
object
the
assertion
of
certain
claims
over
territory
which
formed
no
part
of
the
possessions
of
either
belligerent
hostilities
were
conducted
on
entirely
modern
lines
by
two
armed
nations
and
not
by
standing
armies
alone
but
in
the
case
of
one
belligerent
her
interest
in
the
object
was
so
limited
as
to
cause
her
to
abandon
it
long
before
her
whole
force
as
an
armed
nation
was
exhausted
or
even
put
forth
the
expense
of
life
and
treasure
which
the
struggle
was
involving
was
beyond
what
the
object
was
worth
this
second
distinction
that
is
between
limited
and
unlimited
wars
clausewitz
regarded
as
of
greater
importance
than
his
previous
one
founded
on
the
negative
or
positive
nature
of
the
object
he
was
long
in
reaching
it
his
great
work
as
he
left
it
proceeds
almost
entirely
on
the
conception
of
offensive
or
defensive
as
applied
to
the
napoleonic
ideal
of
absolute
war
the
new
idea
came
to
him
towards
the
end
in
the
full
maturity
of
his
prolonged
study
and
it
came
to
him
in
endeavouring
to
apply
his
strategical
speculations
to
the
practical
process
of
framing
a
war
plan
in
anticipation
of
a
threatened
breach
with
france
it
was
only
in
his
final
section
war
that
he
began
to
deal
with
it
by
that
time
he
had
grasped
the
first
practical
result
to
which
his
theory
led
he
saw
that
the
distinction
between
limited
and
unlimited
war
connoted
a
cardinal
distinction
in
the
methods
of
waging
it
when
the
object
was
unlimited
and
would
consequently
call
forth
your
enemy
whole
war
power
it
was
evident
that
no
firm
decision
of
the
struggle
could
be
reached
till
his
war
power
was
entirely
crushed
unless
you
had
a
reasonable
hope
of
being
able
to
do
this
it
was
bad
policy
to
seek
your
end
by
force
that
is
you
ought
not
to
go
to
war
in
the
case
of
a
limited
object
however
the
complete
destruction
of
the
enemy
armed
force
was
beyond
what
was
necessary
clearly
you
could
achieve
your
end
if
you
could
seize
the
object
and
by
availing
yourself
of
the
elements
of
strength
inherent
in
the
defensive
could
set
up
such
a
situation
that
it
would
cost
the
enemy
more
to
turn
you
out
than
the
object
was
worth
to
him
here
then
was
a
wide
difference
in
the
fundamental
postulate
of
your
war
plan
in
the
case
of
an
unlimited
war
your
main
strategical
offensive
must
be
directed
against
the
armed
forces
of
the
enemy
in
the
case
of
a
limited
war
even
where
its
object
was
positive
it
need
not
be
if
conditions
were
favourable
it
would
suffice
to
make
the
object
itself
the
objective
of
your
main
strategical
offensive
clearly
then
he
had
reached
a
theoretical
distinction
which
modified
his
whole
conception
of
strategy
no
longer
is
there
logically
but
one
kind
of
war
the
absolute
and
no
longer
is
there
but
one
legitimate
objective
the
enemy
armed
forces
being
sound
theory
it
of
course
had
an
immediate
practical
value
for
obviously
it
was
a
distinction
from
which
the
actual
work
of
framing
a
war
plan
must
take
its
departure
a
curious
corroboration
of
the
soundness
of
these
views
is
that
jomini
reached
an
almost
identical
standpoint
independently
and
by
an
entirely
different
road
his
method
was
severely
concrete
based
on
the
comparison
of
observed
facts
but
it
brought
him
as
surely
as
the
abstract
method
of
his
rival
to
the
conclusion
that
there
were
two
distinct
classes
of
object
they
are
of
two
different
kinds
he
says
one
which
may
be
called
territorial
or
geographical
the
other
on
the
contrary
consists
exclusively
in
the
destruction
or
disorganisation
of
the
enemy
forces
without
concerning
yourself
with
geographical
points
of
any
kind
it
is
under
the
first
category
of
his
first
main
classification
of
offensive
wars
to
assert
rights
that
he
deals
with
what
clausewitz
would
call
limited
wars
citing
as
an
example
frederick
the
great
war
for
the
conquest
of
silesia
he
says
in
such
a
war
the
offensive
operations
ought
to
be
proportional
to
the
end
in
view
the
first
move
is
naturally
to
occupy
the
provinces
claimed
not
be
it
noted
to
direct
your
blow
at
the
enemy
main
force
afterwards
he
proceeds
you
can
push
the
offensive
according
to
circumstances
and
your
relative
strength
in
order
to
obtain
the
desired
cession
by
menacing
the
enemy
at
home
here
we
have
clausewitz
whole
doctrine
of
limited
war
firstly
the
primary
or
territorial
stage
in
which
you
endeavour
to
occupy
the
geographical
object
and
then
the
secondary
or
coercive
stage
in
which
you
seek
by
exerting
general
pressure
upon
your
enemy
to
force
him
to
accept
the
adverse
situation
you
have
set
up
such
a
method
of
making
war
obviously
differs
in
a
fundamental
manner
from
that
which
napoleon
habitually
adopted
and
yet
we
have
it
presented
by
jomini
and
clausewitz
the
two
apostles
of
the
napoleonic
method
the
explanation
is
of
course
that
both
of
them
had
seen
too
much
not
to
know
that
napoleon
method
was
only
applicable
when
you
could
command
a
real
physical
or
moral
preponderance
given
such
a
preponderance
both
were
staunch
for
the
use
of
extreme
means
in
napoleon
manner
it
is
not
as
something
better
than
the
higher
road
that
they
commend
the
lower
one
but
being
veteran
and
not
mere
theorists
they
knew
well
that
a
belligerent
must
sometimes
find
the
higher
road
beyond
his
strength
or
beyond
the
effort
which
the
spirit
of
the
nation
is
prepared
to
make
for
the
end
in
view
and
like
the
practical
men
they
were
they
set
themselves
to
study
the
potentialities
of
the
lower
road
should
hard
necessity
force
them
to
travel
it
they
found
that
these
potentialities
in
certain
circumstances
were
great
as
an
example
of
a
case
where
the
lower
form
was
more
appropriate
jomini
cites
napoleon
campaign
against
russia
in
in
his
opinion
it
would
have
been
better
if
napoleon
had
been
satisfied
to
begin
on
the
lower
method
with
a
limited
territorial
object
and
he
attributes
his
failure
to
the
abuse
of
a
method
which
however
well
suited
to
his
wars
in
germany
was
incapable
of
achieving
success
in
the
conditions
presented
by
a
war
with
russia
seeing
how
high
was
napoleon
opinion
of
jomini
as
a
master
of
the
science
of
war
it
is
curious
how
his
views
on
the
two
natures
of
wars
have
been
ignored
in
the
present
day
it
is
even
more
curious
in
the
case
of
clausewitz
since
we
know
that
in
the
plenitude
of
his
powers
he
came
to
regard
this
classification
as
the
of
the
subject
the
explanation
is
that
the
distinction
is
not
very
clearly
formulated
in
his
first
seven
books
which
alone
he
left
in
anything
like
a
finished
condition
it
was
not
till
he
came
to
write
his
eighth
book
war
that
he
saw
the
vital
importance
of
the
distinction
round
which
he
had
been
hovering
in
that
book
the
distinction
is
clearly
laid
down
but
the
book
unhappily
was
never
completed
with
his
manuscript
however
he
left
a
note
warning
us
against
regarding
his
earlier
books
as
a
full
presentation
of
his
developed
ideas
from
the
note
it
is
also
evident
that
he
thought
the
classification
on
which
he
had
lighted
was
of
the
utmost
importance
that
he
believed
it
would
clear
up
all
the
difficulties
which
he
had
encountered
in
his
earlier
books
difficulties
which
he
had
come
to
see
arose
from
a
too
exclusive
consideration
of
the
napoleonic
method
of
conducting
war
i
look
upon
the
first
six
books
he
wrote
in
as
only
a
mass
of
material
which
is
still
in
a
manner
without
form
and
which
has
still
to
be
revised
again
in
this
revision
the
two
kinds
of
wars
will
be
kept
more
distinctly
in
view
all
through
and
thereby
all
ideas
will
gain
in
clearness
in
precision
and
in
exactness
of
application
evidently
he
had
grown
dissatisfied
with
the
theory
of
absolute
war
on
which
he
had
started
his
new
discovery
had
convinced
him
that
that
theory
would
not
serve
as
a
standard
for
all
natures
of
wars
shall
we
he
asks
in
his
final
book
shall
we
now
rest
satisfied
with
this
idea
and
by
it
judge
of
all
wars
however
much
they
may
differ
he
answers
his
question
in
the
negative
you
can
not
determine
the
requirements
of
all
wars
from
the
napoleonic
type
keep
that
type
and
its
absolute
method
before
you
to
use
you
or
you
but
keep
equally
before
you
that
there
are
two
main
natures
of
war
clausewitz
on
war
book
viii
chap
ii
in
his
note
written
at
this
time
when
the
distinction
first
came
to
him
he
defines
these
two
natures
of
war
as
follows
first
those
in
which
the
object
is
the
of
the
whether
it
be
we
aim
at
his
political
destruction
or
merely
at
disarming
him
and
forcing
him
to
conclude
peace
on
our
terms
and
secondly
those
in
which
our
object
is
to
make
some
conquests
on
the
frontiers
of
his
either
for
the
purpose
of
retaining
them
permanently
or
of
turning
them
to
account
as
a
matter
of
exchange
in
settling
terms
of
peace
it
was
in
his
eighth
book
that
he
intended
had
he
lived
to
have
worked
out
the
comprehensive
idea
he
had
conceived
of
that
book
he
says
the
chief
object
will
be
to
make
good
the
two
points
of
view
above
mentioned
by
which
everything
will
be
simplified
and
at
the
same
time
be
given
the
breath
of
life
i
hope
in
this
book
to
iron
out
many
creases
in
the
heads
of
strategists
and
statesmen
and
at
least
to
show
the
object
of
action
and
the
real
point
to
be
considered
in
war
ibid
preparatory
notice

that
hope
was
never
realised
and
that
perhaps
is
why
his
penetrating
analysis
has
been
so
much
ignored
the
eighth
book
as
we
have
it
is
only
a
fragment
in
the
spring
of
an
anxious
moment
when
it
seemed
that
prussia
would
require
all
her
best
for
another
struggle
with
france
he
was
called
away
to
an
active
command
what
he
left
of
the
book
on
war
plans
he
describes
as
merely
a
track
roughly
cleared
as
it
were
through
the
mass
in
order
to
ascertain
the
points
of
greatest
moment
it
was
his
intention
he
says
to
carry
the
spirit
of
these
ideas
into
his
first
six
books
to
put
the
crown
on
his
work
in
fact
by
elaborating
and
insisting
upon
his
two
great
propositions
viz
that
war
was
a
form
of
policy
and
that
being
so
it
might
be
limited
or
unlimited
the
extent
to
which
he
would
have
infused
his
new
idea
into
the
whole
every
one
is
at
liberty
to
judge
for
himself
but
this
indisputable
fact
remains
in
the
winter
in
view
of
the
threatening
attitude
of
france
in
regard
to
belgium
he
drew
up
a
war
plan
and
it
was
designed
not
on
the
napoleonic
method
of
making
the
enemy
armed
force
the
main
strategical
objective
but
on
seizing
a
limited
territorial
object
and
forcing
a
disadvantageous
upon
the
french
the
revolutionary
movement
throughout
europe
had
broken
the
holy
alliance
to
pieces
not
only
did
prussia
find
herself
almost
against
france
but
she
herself
was
sapped
by
revolution
to
adopt
the
higher
form
of
war
and
seek
to
destroy
the
armed
force
of
the
enemy
was
beyond
her
power
but
she
could
still
use
the
lower
form
and
by
seizing
belgium
she
could
herself
force
so
exhausting
a
task
on
france
that
success
was
well
within
her
strength
it
was
exactly
so
we
endeavoured
to
begin
the
seven
years
war
and
it
was
exactly
so
the
japanese
successfully
conducted
their
war
with
russia
and
what
is
more
striking
it
was
on
similar
lines
that
in
moltke
in
similar
circumstances
drew
up
his
first
war
plan
against
france
his
idea
at
that
time
was
on
the
lines
which
jomini
held
should
have
been
napoleon
in
it
was
not
to
strike
directly
at
paris
or
the
french
main
army
but
to
occupy
and
hold
that
territory
till
altered
conditions
should
give
him
the
necessary
preponderance
for
proceeding
to
the
higher
form
or
forcing
a
favourable
peace
in
conclusion
then
we
have
to
note
that
the
matured
fruit
of
the
napoleonic
period
was
a
theory
of
war
based
not
on
the
single
absolute
idea
but
on
the
dual
distinction
of
limited
and
unlimited
whatever
practical
importance
we
may
attach
to
the
distinction
so
much
must
be
admitted
on
the
clear
and
emphatic
pronouncements
of
clausewitz
and
jomini
the
practical
importance
is
another
matter
it
may
fairly
be
argued
that
in
continental
warfare
in
spite
of
the
instances
quoted
by
both
the
classical
writers
it
is
not
very
great
for
reasons
that
will
appear
directly
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
continental
warfare
is
not
the
only
form
in
which
great
international
issues
are
decided
standing
at
the
final
point
which
clausewitz
and
jomini
reached
we
are
indeed
only
on
the
threshold
of
the
subject
we
have
to
begin
where
they
left
off
and
inquire
what
their
ideas
have
to
tell
for
the
modern
conditions
of
worldwide
imperial
states
where
the
sea
becomes
a
direct
and
vital
factor

development
of
clausewitz
and

of
a
limited
territorial
object
and
its
application
to
modern

conditions
the
german

already
cited
which
were
based
respectively
on
the
occupation
of
belgium
and
and
jomini
remarks
on
napoleon
disastrous
russian
campaign
serve
well
to
show
the
point
to
which
continental
strategists
have
advanced
along
the
road
which
clausewitz
was
the
first
to
indicate
clearly
we
have
now
to
consider
its
application
to
modern
imperial
conditions
and
above
all
where
the
maritime
element
forcibly
asserts
itself
we
shall
then
see
how
small
that
advance
has
been
compared
with
its
effects
for
a
maritime
and
above
all
an
insular
power
it
is
clear
that
clausewitz
himself
never
apprehended
the
full
significance
of
his
brilliant
theory
his
outlook
was
still
purely
continental
and
the
limitations
of
continental
warfare
tend
to
veil
the
fuller
meaning
of
the
principle
he
had
framed
had
he
lived
there
is
little
doubt
he
would
have
worked
it
out
to
its
logical
conclusion
but
his
death
condemned
his
theory
of
limited
war
to
remain
in
the
inchoate
condition
in
which
he
had
left
it
it
will
be
observed
as
was
natural
enough
that
all
through
his
work
clausewitz
had
in
his
mind
war
between
two
contiguous
or
at
least
adjacent
continental
states
and
a
moment
consideration
will
show
that
in
that
type
of
war
the
principle
of
the
limited
object
can
rarely
if
ever
assert
itself
in
perfect
precision
clausewitz
himself
put
it
quite
clearly
assuming
a
case
where
the
overthrow
of
the
enemy
that
is
unlimited
war
is
beyond
our
strength
he
points
out
that
we
need
not
therefore
necessarily
act
on
the
defensive
our
action
may
still
be
positive
and
offensive
but
the
object
can
be
nothing
more
than
the
conquest
of
part
of
the
enemy
country
such
a
conquest
he
knew
might
so
far
weaken
your
enemy
or
strengthen
your
own
position
as
to
enable
you
to
secure
a
satisfactory
peace
the
path
of
history
is
indeed
strewn
with
such
cases
but
he
was
careful
to
point
out
that
such
a
form
of
war
was
open
to
the
gravest
objections
once
you
had
occupied
the
territory
you
aimed
at
your
offensive
action
was
as
a
rule
arrested
a
defensive
attitude
had
to
be
assumed
and
such
an
arrest
of
offensive
action
he
had
previously
shown
was
inherently
vicious
if
only
for
moral
reasons
added
to
this
you
might
find
that
in
your
effort
to
occupy
the
territorial
object
you
had
so
irretrievably
separated
your
striking
force
from
your
force
as
to
be
in
no
position
to
meet
your
enemy
if
he
was
able
to
retort
by
acting
on
unlimited
lines
with
a
stroke
at
your
heart
a
case
in
point
was
the
austerlitz
campaign
where
austria
object
was
to
wrest
north
italy
from
napoleon
empire
she
sent
her
main
army
under
the
archduke
charles
to
seize
the
territory
she
desired
napoleon
immediately
struck
at
vienna
destroyed
her
home
army
and
occupied
the
capital
before
the
archduke
could
turn
to
bar
his
way
the
argument
is
this
that
as
all
strategic
attack
tends
to
leave
points
of
your
own
uncovered
it
always
involves
greater
or
less
provision
for
their
defence
it
is
obvious
therefore
that
if
we
are
aiming
at
a
limited
territorial
object
the
proportion
of
defence
required
will
tend
to
be
much
greater
than
if
we
are
directing
our
attack
on
the
main
forces
of
the
enemy
in
unlimited
war
our
attack
will
itself
tend
to
defend
everything
elsewhere
by
forcing
the
enemy
to
concentrate
against
our
attack
whether
the
limited
form
is
justifiable
or
not
therefore
depends
as
clausewitz
points
out
on
the
geographical
position
of
the
object
so
far
british
experience
is
with
him
but
he
then
goes
on
to
say
the
more
closely
the
territory
in
question
is
an
annex
of
our
own
the
safer
is
this
form
of
war
because
then
our
offensive
action
will
the
more
surely
cover
our
home
country
as
a
case
in
point
he
cites
frederick
the
great
opening
of
the
seven
years
war
with
the
occupation
of
saxony
a
piece
of
work
which
materially
strengthened
prussian
defence
of
the
british
opening
in
canada
he
says
nothing
his
outlook
was
too
exclusively
continental
for
it
to
occur
to
him
to
test
his
doctrine
with
a
conspicuously
successful
case
in
which
the
territory
aimed
at
was
distant
from
the
home
territory
and
in
no
way
covered
it
had
he
done
so
he
must
have
seen
how
much
stronger
an
example
of
the
strength
of
limited
war
was
the
case
of
canada
than
the
case
of
saxony
moreover
he
would
have
seen
that
the
difficulties
which
in
spite
of
his
faith
in
his
discovery
accompanied
his
attempt
to
apply
it
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
examples
he
selected
were
not
really
examples
at
all
when
he
conceived
the
idea
the
only
kind
of
limited
object
he
had
in
his
mind
was
to
use
his
own
words
some
conquests
on
the
frontiers
of
the
enemy
country
such
as
silesia
and
saxony
for
frederick
the
great
belgium
in
his
own
war
plan
and
in
that
of
moltke
now
it
is
obvious
that
such
objects
are
not
truly
limited
for
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
such
territory
is
usually
an
organic
part
of
your
country
or
otherwise
of
so
much
importance
to
him
that
he
will
be
willing
to
use
unlimited
effort
to
retain
it
in
the
second
place
there
will
be
no
strategical
obstacle
to
his
being
able
to
use
his
whole
force
to
that
end
to
satisfy
the
full
conception
of
a
limited
object
one
of
two
conditions
is
essential
firstly
it
must
be
not
merely
limited
in
area
but
of
really
limited
political
importance
and
secondly
it
must
be
so
situated
as
to
be
strategically
isolated
or
to
be
capable
of
being
reduced
to
practical
isolation
by
strategical
operations
unless
this
condition
exists
it
is
in
the
power
of
either
belligerent
as
clausewitz
himself
saw
to
pass
to
unlimited
war
if
he
so
desires
and
ignoring
the
territorial
objective
to
strike
at
the
heart
of
his
enemy
and
force
him
to
desist
if
then
we
only
regard
war
between
contiguous
continental
states
in
which
the
object
is
the
conquest
of
territory
on
either
of
their
frontiers
we
get
no
real
generic
difference
between
limited
and
unlimited
war
the
line
between
them
is
in
any
case
too
shadowy
or
unstable
to
give
a
classification
of
any
solidity
it
is
a
difference
of
degree
rather
than
of
kind
if
on
the
other
hand
we
extend
our
view
to
wars
between
worldwide
empires
the
distinction
at
once
becomes
organic
possessions
which
lie
oversea
or
at
the
extremities
of
vast
areas
of
imperfectly
settled
territory
are
in
an
entirely
different
category
from
those
limited
objects
which
clausewitz
contemplated
history
shows
that
they
can
never
have
the
political
importance
of
objects
which
are
organically
part
of
the
european
system
and
it
shows
further
that
they
can
be
isolated
by
naval
action
sufficiently
to
set
up
the
conditions
of
true
limited
war
jomini
approaches
the
point
but
without
clearly
detaching
it
in
his
chapter
on
great
invasions
and
distant
expeditions
he
points
out
how
unsafe
it
is
to
take
the
conditions
of
war
between
contiguous
states
and
apply
them
crudely
to
cases
where
the
belligerents
are
separated
by
large
areas
of
land
or
sea
he
hovers
round
the
sea
factor
feeling
how
great
a
difference
it
makes
but
without
getting
close
to
the
real
distinction
his
conception
of
the
of
fleets
and
armies
never
rises
above
their
actual
in
touch
one
with
the
other
in
a
distant
theatre
he
has
in
mind
the
assistance
which
the
british
fleet
afforded
wellington
in
the
peninsula
and
napoleon
dreams
of
asiatic
conquest
pronouncing
such
distant
invasions
as
impossible
in
modern
times
except
perhaps
in
combination
with
a
powerful
fleet
that
could
provide
the
army
of
invasion
with
successive
advanced
bases
of
the
paramount
value
of
the
isolating
and
preventive
functions
he
gives
no
hint
even
when
he
deals
with
oversea
expeditions
as
he
does
at
some
length
his
grip
of
the
point
is
no
closer
it
is
indeed
significant
of
how
entirely
continental
thought
had
failed
to
penetrate
the
subject
that
in
devoting
over
thirty
pages
to
an
enumeration
of
the
principles
of
oversea
expeditions
he
like
clausewitz
does
not
so
much
as
mention
the
conquest
of
canada
and
yet
it
is
the
leading
case
of
a
weak
military
power
succeeding
by
the
use
of
the
limited
form
of
war
in
forcing
its
will
upon
a
strong
one
and
succeeding
because
it
was
able
by
naval
action
to
secure
its
home
defence
and
isolate
the
territorial
object
for
our
ideas
of
true
limited
objects
therefore
we
must
leave
the
continental
theatres
and
turn
to
mixed
or
maritime
wars
we
have
to
look
to
such
cases
as
canada
and
havana
in
the
seven
years
war
and
cuba
in
the
war
cases
in
which
complete
isolation
of
the
object
by
naval
action
was
possible
or
to
such
examples
as
the
crimea
and
korea
where
sufficient
isolation
was
attainable
by
naval
action
owing
to
the
length
and
difficulty
of
the
enemy
land
communications
and
to
the
strategical
situation
of
the
territory
at
stake
these
examples
will
also
serve
to
illustrate
and
enforce
the
second
essential
of
this
kind
of
war
as
has
been
already
said
for
a
true
limited
object
we
must
have
not
only
the
power
of
isolation
but
also
the
power
by
a
secure
home
defence
of
barring
an
unlimited
counterstroke
in
all
the
above
cases
this
condition
existed
in
all
of
them
the
belligerents
had
no
contiguous
frontiers
and
this
point
is
vital
for
it
is
obvious
that
if
two
belligerents
have
a
common
frontier
it
is
open
to
the
superior
of
them
no
matter
how
distant
or
how
easy
to
isolate
the
limited
object
may
be
to
pass
at
will
to
unlimited
war
by
invasion
this
process
is
even
possible
when
the
belligerents
are
separated
by
a
neutral
state
since
the
territory
of
a
weak
neutral
will
be
violated
if
the
object
be
of
sufficient
importance
or
if
the
neutral
be
too
strong
to
coerce
there
still
remains
the
possibility
that
his
alliance
may
be
secured
we
come
then
to
this
final
proposition
that
limited
war
is
only
permanently
possible
to
island
powers
or
between
powers
which
are
separated
by
sea
and
then
only
when
the
power
desiring
limited
war
is
able
to
command
the
sea
to
such
a
degree
as
to
be
able
not
only
to
isolate
the
distant
object
but
also
to
render
impossible
the
invasion
of
his
home
territory
here
then
we
reach
the
true
meaning
and
highest
military
value
of
what
we
call
the
command
of
the
sea
and
here
we
touch
the
secret
of
success
against
powers
so
greatly
superior
to
herself
in
military
strength
it
is
only
fitting
that
such
a
secret
should
have
been
first
penetrated
by
an
englishman
for
so
it
was
though
it
must
be
said
that
except
in
the
light
of
clausewitz
doctrine
the
full
meaning
of
bacon
famous
aphorism
is
not
revealed
this
much
is
certain
said
the
great
elizabethan
on
the
experience
of
our
first
imperial
war
he
that
commands
the
sea
is
at
great
liberty
and
may
take
as
much
or
as
little
of
the
war
as
he
will
whereas
those
that
be
strongest
by
land
are
many
times
nevertheless
in
great
straits
it
would
be
difficult
to
state
more
pithily
the
ultimate
significance
of
clausewitz
doctrine
its
cardinal
truth
is
clearly
indicated
that
limited
wars
do
not
turn
upon
the
armed
strength
of
the
belligerents
but
upon
the
amount
of
that
strength
which
they
are
able
or
willing
to
bring
to
bear
at
the
decisive
point
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
clausewitz
did
not
live
to
see
with
eyes
and
to
work
out
the
full
comprehensiveness
of
his
doctrine
his
ambition
was
to
formulate
a
theory
which
would
explain
all
wars
he
believed
he
had
done
so
and
yet
it
is
clear
he
never
knew
how
complete
was
his
success
nor
how
wide
was
the
field
he
had
covered
to
the
end
it
would
seem
he
was
unaware
that
he
had
found
an
explanation
of
one
of
the
most
inscrutable
problems
in
history
the
expansion
of
england
at
least
so
far
as
it
has
been
due
to
successful
war
that
a
small
country
with
a
weak
army
should
have
been
able
to
gather
to
herself
the
most
desirable
regions
of
the
earth
and
to
gather
them
at
the
expense
of
the
greatest
military
powers
is
a
paradox
to
which
such
powers
find
it
hard
to
be
reconciled
the
phenomenon
seemed
always
a
matter
of
accident
without
any
foundation
in
the
essential
constants
of
war
it
remained
for
clausewitz
unknown
to
himself
to
discover
that
explanation
and
he
reveals
it
to
us
in
the
inherent
strength
of
limited
war
when
means
and
conditions
are
favourable
for
its
use
we
find
then
if
we
take
a
wider
view
than
was
open
to
clausewitz
and
submit
his
latest
ideas
to
the
test
of
present
imperial
conditions
so
far
from
failing
to
cover
the
ground
they
gain
a
fuller
meaning
and
a
firmer
basis
apply
them
to
maritime
warfare
and
it
becomes
clear
that
his
distinction
between
limited
and
unlimited
war
does
not
rest
alone
on
the
moral
factor
a
war
may
be
limited
not
only
because
the
importance
of
the
object
is
too
limited
to
call
forth
the
whole
national
force
but
also
because
the
sea
may
be
made
to
present
an
insuperable
physical
obstacle
to
the
whole
national
force
being
brought
to
bear
that
is
to
say
a
war
may
be
limited
physically
by
the
strategical
isolation
of
the
object
as
well
as
morally
by
its
comparative
unimportance
chapter
five
wars
of
intervention
limited
interference
in
unlimited
war
before
leaving
the
general
consideration
of
limited
war
we
have
still
to
deal
with
a
form
of
it
that
has
not
yet
been
mentioned
clausewitz
gave
it
provisionally
the
name
of
war
limited
by
contingent
and
could
find
no
place
for
it
in
his
system
it
appeared
to
him
to
differ
essentially
from
war
limited
by
its
political
object
or
as
jomini
put
it
war
with
a
territorial
object
yet
it
had
to
be
taken
into
account
and
explained
if
only
for
the
part
it
had
played
in
european
history
for
us
it
calls
for
the
most
careful
examination
not
only
because
it
baffled
the
great
german
strategist
to
reconcile
it
with
his
theory
of
war
but
also
because
it
is
the
form
in
which
great
britain
most
successfully
demonstrated
the
potentiality
for
direct
continental
interference
of
a
small
army
acting
in
conjunction
with
a
dominant
fleet
the
combined
operations
which
were
the
normal
expression
of
the
british
method
of
making
war
on
the
limited
basis
were
of
two
main
classes
firstly
there
were
those
designed
purely
for
the
conquest
of
the
objects
for
which
we
went
to
war
which
were
usually
colonial
or
distant
oversea
territory
and
secondly
operations
more
or
less
upon
the
european
seaboard
designed
not
for
permanent
conquest
but
as
a
method
of
disturbing
our
enemy
plans
and
strengthening
the
hands
of
our
allies
and
our
own
position
such
operations
might
take
the
form
of
insignificant
coastal
diversions
or
they
might
rise
through
all
degrees
of
importance
till
as
in
wellington
operations
in
the
peninsula
they
became
indistinguishable
in
form
from
regular
continental
warfare
it
would
seem
therefore
that
these
operations
were
distinguished
not
so
much
by
the
nature
of
the
object
as
by
the
fact
that
we
devoted
to
them
not
the
whole
of
our
military
strength
but
only
a
certain
part
of
it
which
was
known
as
our
disposal
force
consequently
they
appear
to
call
for
some
such
special
classification
and
to
fall
naturally
into
the
category
which
clausewitz
called
war
limited
by
contingent
it
was
a
nature
of
war
well
enough
known
in
another
form
on
the
continent
during
the
eighteenth
century
there
had
been
a
large
number
of
cases
of
war
actually
limited
by
contingent
that
is
cases
where
a
country
not
having
a
vital
interest
in
the
object
made
war
by
furnishing
the
chief
belligerent
with
an
auxiliary
force
of
a
stipulated
strength
it
was
in
the
sixth
chapter
of
his
last
book
that
clausewitz
intended
to
deal
with
this
anomalous
form
of
hostility
his
untimely
death
however
has
left
us
with
no
more
than
a
fragment
in
which
he
confesses
that
such
cases
are
embarrassing
to
his
theory
if
he
adds
the
auxiliary
force
were
placed
unreservedly
at
the
disposal
of
the
chief
belligerent
the
problem
would
be
simple
enough
it
would
then
in
effect
be
the
same
thing
as
unlimited
war
with
the
aid
of
a
subsidised
force
but
in
fact
as
he
observes
this
seldom
happened
for
the
contingent
was
always
more
or
less
controlled
in
accordance
with
the
special
political
aims
of
the
government
which
furnished
it
consequently
the
only
conclusion
he
succeeded
in
reaching
was
that
it
was
a
form
of
war
that
had
to
be
taken
into
account
and
that
it
was
a
form
of
limited
war
that
appeared
to
differ
essentially
from
war
limited
by
object
we
are
left
in
fact
with
an
impression
that
there
must
be
two
kinds
of
limited
war
but
if
we
pursue
his
historical
method
and
examine
the
cases
in
which
this
nature
of
war
was
successful
and
those
in
which
it
was
unsuccessful
we
shall
find
that
wherever
success
is
taken
as
an
index
of
its
legitimate
employment
the
practical
distinction
between
the
two
kinds
of
limited
war
tends
to
disappear
the
indications
are
that
where
the
essential
factors
which
justify
the
use
of
war
limited
by
object
are
present
in
war
limited
by
contingent
then
that
form
of
war
tends
to
succeed
but
not
otherwise
we
are
brought
in
fact
to
this
proposition
that
the
distinction
limited
by
contingent
is
not
one
that
is
inherent
in
war
and
is
quite
out
of
line
with
the
theory
in
hand
that
in
reality
it
is
not
a
of
war
but
a
which
may
be
employed
either
for
limited
or
unlimited
war
in
other
words
war
limited
by
contingent
if
it
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
legitimate
form
of
war
at
all
must
take
frankly
the
one
shape
or
the
other
either
the
contingent
must
act
as
an
organic
unit
of
the
force
making
unlimited
war
without
any
reservations
whatever
or
else
it
should
be
given
a
definite
territorial
object
with
an
independent
organisation
and
an
independent
limited
function
our
own
experience
seems
to
indicate
that
war
by
contingent
or
war
with
a
disposal
force
attains
the
highest
success
when
it
approaches
most
closely
to
true
limited
war
that
is
as
in
the
case
of
the
peninsula
and
the
crimea
where
its
object
is
to
wrest
or
secure
from
the
enemy
a
definite
piece
of
territory
that
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
can
be
isolated
by
naval
action
its
operative
power
in
fact
appears
to
bear
some
direct
relation
to
the
intimacy
with
which
naval
and
military
action
can
be
combined
to
give
the
contingent
a
weight
and
mobility
that
are
beyond
its
intrinsic
power
if
then
we
would
unravel
the
difficulties
of
war
limited
by
contingent
it
seems
necessary
to
distinguish
between
the
continental
and
the
british
form
of
it
the
continental
form
as
we
have
seen
differs
but
little
in
conception
from
unlimited
war
the
contingent
is
furnished
at
least
ostensibly
with
the
idea
that
it
is
to
be
used
by
the
chief
belligerent
to
assist
him
in
overthrowing
the
common
enemy
and
that
its
objective
will
be
the
enemy
organised
forces
or
his
capital
or
it
may
be
that
the
contingent
is
to
be
used
as
an
army
of
observation
to
prevent
a
counterstroke
so
as
to
facilitate
and
secure
the
main
offensive
movement
of
the
chief
belligerent
in
either
case
however
small
may
be
our
contribution
to
the
allied
force
we
are
using
the
unlimited
form
and
aiming
at
an
unlimited
and
not
a
mere
territorial
object
if
now
we
turn
to
british
experience
of
war
limited
by
contingent
we
find
that
the
continental
form
has
frequently
been
used
but
we
also
find
it
almost
invariably
accompanied
by
a
popular
repugnance
as
though
there
were
something
in
it
antagonistic
to
the
national
instinct
a
leading
case
is
the
assistance
we
sent
to
frederick
the
great
in
the
seven
years
war
at
the
opening
of
the
war
so
great
was
the
popular
repugnance
that
the
measure
was
found
impossible
and
it
was
not
till
frederick
dazzling
resistance
to
the
catholic
powers
had
clothed
him
with
the
glory
of
a
protestant
hero
that
pitt
could
do
what
he
wanted
the
old
religious
fire
was
stirred
the
most
potent
of
all
national
instincts
kindled
the
people
to
a
generous
warmth
which
overcame
their
inborn
antipathy
to
continental
operations
and
it
was
possible
to
send
a
substantial
contingent
to
frederick
assistance
in
the
end
the
support
fully
achieved
its
purpose
but
it
must
be
noted
that
even
in
this
case
the
operations
were
limited
not
only
by
contingent
but
also
by
object
it
is
true
that
frederick
was
engaged
in
an
unlimited
war
in
which
the
continued
existence
of
prussia
was
at
stake
and
that
the
british
force
was
an
organic
element
in
his
war
plan
nevertheless
it
formed
part
of
a
british
subsidised
army
under
prince
ferdinand
of
brunswick
who
though
nominated
by
frederick
was
a
british
his
army
was
in
organisation
entirely
distinct
from
that
of
frederick
and
it
was
assigned
the
very
definite
and
limited
function
of
preventing
the
french
occupying
hanover
and
so
turning
the
prussian
right
flank
finally
it
must
be
noted
that
its
ability
to
perform
this
function
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
theatre
of
operations
assigned
to
it
was
such
that
in
no
probable
event
could
it
lose
touch
with
the
sea
nor
could
the
enemy
cut
its
lines
of
supply
and
retreat
these
features
of
the
enterprise
should
be
noted
they
differentiate
it
from
our
earlier
use
of
war
limited
by
contingent
in
the
continental
manner
of
which
marlborough
campaigns
were
typical
and
they
exhibit
the
special
form
which
marlborough
would
have
chosen
had
political
exigencies
permitted
and
which
was
to
become
characteristic
of
british
effort
from
pitt
time
onward
in
the
method
of
our
greatest
war
minister
we
have
not
only
the
limit
by
contingent
but
also
the
limit
of
a
definite
and
independent
function
and
finally
we
have
touch
with
the
sea
this
is
the
really
vital
factor
and
upon
it
as
will
presently
appear
depends
the
strength
of
the
method
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
great
war
we
employed
the
same
form
in
our
operations
in
europe
there
we
had
also
the
limited
function
of
securing
holland
and
also
complete
touch
with
the
sea
but
our
theatre
of
operations
was
not
independent
intimate
concerted
action
with
other
forces
was
involved
and
the
result
in
every
case
was
failure
later
on
in
sicily
where
absolute
isolation
was
attainable
the
strength
of
the
method
enabled
us
to
achieve
a
lasting
result
with
very
slender
means
but
the
result
was
purely
defensive
it
was
not
till
the
peninsular
war
developed
that
we
found
a
theatre
for
war
limited
by
contingent
in
which
all
the
conditions
that
make
for
success
were
present
even
there
so
long
as
our
army
was
regarded
as
a
contingent
auxiliary
to
the
spanish
army
the
usual
failure
ensued
only
in
portugal
the
defence
of
which
was
a
true
limited
object
and
where
we
had
a
theatre
independent
of
extraneous
allies
was
success
achieved
from
the
first
so
strong
was
the
method
here
and
so
exhausting
the
method
which
it
forced
on
the
enemy
that
the
local
balance
of
force
was
eventually
reversed
and
we
were
able
to
pass
to
a
drastic
offensive
the
real
secret
of
wellington
success
apart
from
his
own
genius
was
that
in
perfect
conditions
he
was
applying
the
limited
form
to
an
unlimited
war
our
object
was
unlimited
it
was
nothing
less
than
the
overthrow
of
napoleon
complete
success
at
sea
had
failed
to
do
it
but
that
success
had
given
us
the
power
of
applying
the
limited
form
which
was
the
most
decisive
form
of
offence
within
our
means
its
substantial
contribution
to
the
final
achievement
of
the
object
is
now
universally
recognised
the
general
result
then
of
these
considerations
is
that
war
by
contingent
in
the
continental
form
seldom
or
never
differs
generically
from
unlimited
war
for
the
conditions
required
by
limited
war
are
seldom
or
never
present
but
what
may
be
called
the
british
or
maritime
form
is
in
fact
the
application
of
the
limited
method
to
the
unlimited
form
as
ancillary
to
the
larger
operations
of
our
allies
a
method
which
has
usually
been
open
to
us
because
the
control
of
the
sea
has
enabled
us
to
select
a
theatre
in
effect
truly
limited
wellington
view
of
the
essential
factor
was
expressed
to
rear
admiral
martin
who
was
sent
to
spain
by
the
admiralty
to
confer
with
him
in
september
if
anyone
he
said
wishes
to
know
the
history
of
this
war
i
will
tell
them
it
is
our
maritime
superiority

power
of
maintaining
my
army
while
the
enemy
are
unable
to
do
so
of
sir
byam

records
society
ii
but
what
if
the
conditions
of
the
struggle
in
which
we
wish
to
intervene
are
such
that
no
truly
limited
theatre
is
available
in
that
case
we
have
to
choose
between
placing
a
contingent
frankly
at
the
disposal
of
our
ally
or
confining
ourselves
to
coastal
diversion
as
we
did
at
frederick
the
great
request
in
the
early
campaigns
of
the
seven
years
war
such
operations
can
seldom
be
satisfactory
to
either
party
the
small
positive
results
of
our
efforts
to
intervene
in
this
way
have
indeed
done
more
than
anything
to
discredit
this
form
of
war
and
to
brand
it
as
unworthy
of
a
power
yet
the
fact
remains
that
all
the
great
continental
masters
of
war
have
feared
or
valued
british
intervention
of
this
character
even
in
the
most
unfavourable
conditions
it
was
because
they
looked
for
its
effects
rather
in
the
threat
than
in
the
performance
they
did
not
reckon
for
positive
results
at
all
so
long
as
such
intervention
took
an
amphibious
form
they
knew
its
disturbing
effect
upon
a
european
situation
was
always
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
intrinsic
strength
employed
or
the
positive
results
it
could
give
its
operative
action
was
that
it
threatened
positive
results
unless
it
were
strongly
met
its
effect
in
short
was
negative
its
value
lay
in
its
power
of
containing
force
greater
than
its
own
that
is
all
that
can
be
claimed
for
it
but
it
may
be
all
that
is
required
it
is
not
the
most
drastic
method
of
intervention
but
it
has
proved
itself
the
most
drastic
for
a
power
whose
forces
are
not
adapted
for
the
higher
method
frederick
the
great
was
the
first
great
soldier
to
recognise
it
and
napoleon
was
the
last
for
years
he
shut
his
eyes
to
it
laughed
at
it
covered
it
with
a
contempt
that
grew
ever
more
irritable
in
he
called
craig
expedition
a
pygmy
combination
yet
the
preparation
of
another
combined
force
for
an
entirely
different
destination
caused
him
to
see
the
first
as
an
advance
guard
of
a
movement
he
could
not
ignore
and
he
sacrificed
his
fleet
in
an
impotent
effort
to
deal
with
it
it
was
not
however
till
four
years
later
that
he
was
forced
to
place
on
record
his
recognition
of
the
principle
then
curiously
enough
he
was
convinced
by
an
expedition
which
we
have
come
to
regard
as
above
all
others
condemnatory
of
amphibious
operations
against
the
continent
the
walcheren
expedition
is
now
usually
held
as
the
leading
case
of
fatuous
war
administration
historians
can
find
no
words
too
bad
for
it
they
ignore
the
fact
that
it
was
a
step
the
final
and
most
difficult
step
in
our
policy
of
using
the
army
to
perfect
our
command
of
the
sea
against
a
fleet
acting
stubbornly
on
the
defensive
it
began
with
copenhagen
in
it
failed
at
the
dardanelles
because
fleet
and
army
were
separated
it
succeeded
at
lisbon
and
at
cadiz
by
demonstration
alone
walcheren
long
contemplated
had
been
put
off
till
the
last
as
the
most
formidable
and
the
least
pressing
napoleon
had
been
looking
for
the
attempt
ever
since
the
idea
was
first
broached
in
this
country
but
as
time
passed
and
the
blow
did
not
fall
the
danger
came
to
be
more
and
more
ignored
finally
the
moment
came
when
he
was
heavily
engaged
in
austria
and
forced
to
call
up
the
bulk
of
his
strength
to
deal
with
the
archduke
charles
the
risks
were
still
great
but
the
british
government
faced
them
boldly
with
open
eyes
it
was
now
or
never
they
were
bent
on
developing
their
utmost
military
strength
in
the
peninsula
and
so
long
as
a
potent
and
growing
fleet
remained
in
the
north
sea
it
would
always
act
as
an
increasing
drag
on
such
development
the
prospective
gain
of
success
was
in
the
eyes
of
the
government
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
probable
loss
by
failure
so
when
napoleon
least
expected
it
they
determined
to
act
and
caught
him
napping
the
defences
of
antwerp
had
been
left
incomplete
there
was
no
army
to
meet
the
blow
nothing
but
a
polyglot
rabble
without
staff
or
even
officers
for
a
week
at
least
success
was
in
our
hands
fleet
only
escaped
by
hours
and
yet
the
failure
was
not
only
complete
but
disastrous
still
so
entirely
were
the
causes
of
failure
accidental
and
so
near
had
it
come
to
success
that
napoleon
received
a
thorough
shock
and
looked
for
a
quick
repetition
of
the
attempt
so
seriously
indeed
did
he
regard
his
narrow
escape
that
he
found
himself
driven
to
reconsider
his
whole
system
of
home
defence
not
only
did
he
deem
it
necessary
to
spend
large
sums
in
increasing
the
fixed
defences
of
antwerp
and
toulon
but
his
director
of
conscription
was
called
upon
to
work
out
a
scheme
for
providing
a
permanent
force
of
no
less
than
men
from
the
national
guard
to
defend
the
french
coasts
with
men
in
transports
at
the
downs
the
emperor
wrote
the
english
can
paralyse
of
my
army
and
that
will
reduce
us
to
the
rank
of
a
power
de
xix
september
the
concentration
of
the
british
efforts
in
the
peninsula
apparently
rendered
the
realisation
of
this
project
unnecessary
that
is
our
line
of
operation
was
declared
and
the
threat
ceased
but
none
the
less
recognition
of
the
principle
remains
on
record
not
in
one
of
his
speeches
made
for
some
ulterior
purpose
but
in
a
staff
order
to
the
principal
officer
concerned
it
is
generally
held
that
modern
developments
in
military
organisation
and
transport
will
enable
a
great
continental
power
to
ignore
such
threats
napoleon
ignored
them
in
the
past
but
only
to
verify
the
truth
that
in
war
to
ignore
a
threat
is
too
often
to
create
an
opportunity
such
opportunities
may
occur
late
or
early
as
both
lord
ligonier
and
wolfe
laid
it
down
for
such
operations
surprise
is
not
necessarily
to
be
looked
for
at
the
beginning
we
have
usually
had
to
create
or
wait
for
our
opportunity
too
often
because
we
were
either
not
ready
or
not
bold
enough
to
seize
the
first
that
occurred
the
cases
in
which
such
intervention
has
been
most
potent
have
been
of
two
classes
firstly
there
is
the
intrusion
into
a
war
plan
which
our
enemy
has
designed
without
allowing
for
our
intervention
and
to
which
he
is
irrevocably
committed
by
his
opening
movements
secondly
there
is
intervention
to
deprive
the
enemy
of
the
fruits
of
victory
this
form
finds
its
efficacy
in
the
principle
that
unlimited
wars
are
not
always
decided
by
the
destruction
of
armies
there
usually
remains
the
difficult
work
of
conquering
the
people
afterwards
with
an
exhausted
army
the
intrusion
of
a
small
fresh
force
from
the
sea
in
such
cases
may
suffice
to
turn
the
scale
as
it
did
in
the
peninsula
and
as
in
the
opinion
of
some
high
authorities
it
might
have
done
in
france
in
such
a
suggestion
will
appear
to
be
almost
heretical
as
sinning
against
the
principle
which
condemns
a
strategical
reserve
we
say
that
the
whole
available
force
should
be
developed
for
the
vital
period
of
the
struggle
no
one
can
be
found
to
dispute
it
nowadays
it
is
too
obviously
true
when
it
is
a
question
of
a
conflict
between
organised
forces
but
in
the
absence
of
all
proof
we
are
entitled
to
doubt
whether
it
is
true
for
that
exhausting
and
demoralising
period
which
lies
beyond
the
shock
of
armies
chapter
six
conditions
of
strength
in
limited
war
the
elements
of
strength
in
limited
war
are
closely
analogous
to
those
generally
inherent
in
defence
that
is
to
say
that
as
a
correct
use
of
defence
will
sometimes
enable
an
inferior
force
to
gain
its
end
against
a
superior
one
so
are
there
instances
in
which
the
correct
use
of
the
limited
form
of
war
has
enabled
a
weak
military
power
to
attain
success
against
a
much
stronger
one
and
these
instances
are
too
numerous
to
permit
us
to
regard
the
results
as
accidental
an
obvious
element
of
strength
is
that
where
the
geographical
conditions
are
favourable
we
are
able
by
the
use
of
our
navy
to
restrict
the
amount
of
force
our
army
will
have
to
deal
with
we
can
in
fact
bring
up
our
fleet
to
redress
the
adverse
balance
of
our
land
force
but
apart
from
this
very
practical
reason
there
is
another
which
is
rooted
in
the
first
principles
of
strategy
it
is
that
limited
war
permits
the
use
of
the
defensive
without
its
usual
drawbacks
to
a
degree
that
is
impossible
in
unlimited
war
these
drawbacks
are
chiefly
that
it
tends
to
surrender
the
initiative
to
the
enemy
and
that
it
deprives
us
of
the
moral
exhilaration
of
the
offensive
but
in
limited
war
as
we
shall
see
this
need
not
be
the
case
and
if
without
making
these
sacrifices
we
are
able
to
act
mainly
on
the
defensive
our
position
becomes
exceedingly
strong
the
proposition
really
admits
of
no
doubt
for
even
if
we
be
not
in
agreement
with
clausewitz
doctrine
of
the
strength
of
defence
still
we
may
at
least
accept
moltke
modification
of
it
he
held
that
the
strongest
form
of
war
that
is
the
form
which
economically
makes
for
the
highest
development
of
strength
in
a
given
force
is
strategic
offensive
combined
with
tactical
defensive
now
these
are
in
effect
the
conditions
which
limited
war
should
give
that
is
if
the
theatre
and
method
be
rightly
chosen
let
it
be
remembered
that
the
use
of
this
form
of
war
presupposes
that
we
are
able
by
superior
readiness
or
mobility
or
by
being
more
conveniently
situated
to
establish
ourselves
in
the
territorial
object
before
our
opponent
can
gather
strength
to
prevent
us
this
done
we
have
the
initiative
and
the
enemy
being
unable
by
hypothesis
to
attack
us
at
home
must
conform
to
our
opening
by
endeavouring
to
turn
us
out
we
are
in
a
position
to
meet
his
attack
on
ground
of
our
own
choice
and
to
avail
ourselves
of
such
opportunities
of
as
his
distant
and
therefore
exhausting
offensive
movements
are
likely
to
offer
assuming
as
in
our
own
case
we
always
must
assume
that
the
territorial
object
is
and
our
enemy
is
not
able
to
command
the
sea
such
opportunities
are
certain
to
present
themselves
and
even
if
they
are
not
used
will
greatly
embarrass
the
main
attack
as
was
abundantly
shown
in
the
russian
nervousness
during
their
advance
into
the
liaotung
peninsula
due
to
the
fear
of
a
from
the
gulf
of
the
actual
situation
which
this
method
of
procedure
sets
up
is
that
our
major
strategy
is
offensive
that
is
our
main
movement
is
positive
having
for
its
aim
the
occupation
of
the
territorial
object
the
minor
strategy
that
follows
should
be
in
its
general
lines
defensive
designed
so
soon
as
the
enemy
sets
about
dislodging
us
to
develop
the
utmost
energy
of
which
our
force
and
opportunities
justify
now
if
we
consider
that
by
universal
agreement
it
is
no
longer
possible
in
the
present
conditions
of
land
warfare
to
draw
a
line
between
tactics
and
minor
strategy
we
have
in
our
favour
for
all
practical
purposes
the
identical
position
which
moltke
regarded
as
constituting
the
strongest
form
of
war
that
is
to
say
our
major
strategy
is
offensive
and
our
minor
strategy
is
defensive
if
then
the
limited
form
of
war
has
this
element
of
strength
over
and
above
the
unlimited
form
it
must
be
correct
to
use
it
when
we
are
not
strong
enough
to
use
the
more
exhausting
form
and
when
the
object
is
limited
just
as
much
as
it
is
correct
to
use
the
defensive
when
our
object
is
negative
and
we
are
too
weak
for
the
offensive
the
point
is
of
the
highest
importance
for
it
is
a
direct
negation
of
the
current
doctrine
that
in
war
there
can
be
but
one
legitimate
object
the
overthrow
of
the
enemy
means
of
resistance
and
that
the
primary
objective
must
always
be
his
armed
forces
it
raises
in
fact
the
whole
question
as
to
whether
it
is
not
sometimes
legitimate
and
even
correct
to
aim
directly
at
the
ulterior
object
of
the
war
an
impression
appears
to
prevail
in
spite
of
all
that
clausewitz
and
jomini
had
to
say
on
the
point
that
the
question
admits
of
only
one
answer
von
der
goltz
for
instance
is
particularly
emphatic
in
asserting
that
the
overthrow
of
the
enemy
must
always
be
the
object
in
modern
war
he
lays
it
down
as
the
first
principle
of
modern
warfare
that
the
immediate
objective
against
which
all
our
efforts
must
be
directed
is
the
hostile
main
army
similarly
prince
kraft
has
the
maxim
that
the
first
aim
should
be
to
overcome
the
enemy
army
everything
else
the
occupation
of
the
country
only
comes
in
the
second
line
it
will
be
observed
that
he
here
admits
that
the
process
of
occupying
the
enemy
territory
is
an
operation
distinct
from
the
overthrow
of
the
enemy
force
von
der
goltz
goes
further
and
protests
against
the
common
error
of
regarding
the
annihilation
of
the
enemy
principal
army
as
synonymous
with
the
complete
attainment
of
the
object
he
is
careful
to
assert
that
the
current
doctrine
only
holds
good
when
the
two
belligerent
states
are
of
approximately
the
same
nature
if
then
there
are
cases
in
which
the
occupation
of
territory
must
be
undertaken
as
an
operation
distinct
from
defeating
the
enemy
forces
and
if
in
such
cases
the
conditions
are
such
that
we
can
occupy
the
territory
with
advantage
without
first
defeating
the
enemy
it
is
surely
mere
pedantry
to
insist
that
we
should
put
off
till
what
we
can
do
better
if
the
occupation
of
the
enemy
whole
territory
is
involved
or
even
a
substantial
part
of
it
the
german
principle
of
course
holds
good
but
all
wars
are
not
of
that
character
insistence
on
the
principle
of
overthrow
and
even
its
exaggeration
was
of
value
in
its
day
to
prevent
a
recurrence
to
the
old
and
discredited
methods
but
its
work
is
done
and
blind
adherence
to
it
without
regard
to
the
principles
on
which
it
rests
tends
to
turn
the
art
of
war
into
mere
bludgeon
play
clausewitz
at
any
rate
as
general
von
caemmerer
has
pointed
out
was
far
too
practical
a
soldier
to
commit
himself
to
so
abstract
a
proposition
in
all
its
modern
crudity
if
it
were
true
it
would
never
be
possible
for
a
weaker
power
to
make
successful
war
against
a
stronger
one
in
any
cause
whatever
a
conclusion
abundantly
refuted
by
historical
experience
that
the
higher
form
like
the
offensive
is
the
more
drastic
is
certain
if
conditions
are
suitable
for
its
use
but
clausewitz
it
must
be
remembered
distinctly
lays
it
down
that
such
conditions
presuppose
in
the
belligerent
employing
the
higher
form
a
great
physical
or
moral
superiority
or
a
great
spirit
of
enterprise
an
innate
propensity
for
extreme
hazards
jomini
did
not
go
even
so
far
as
this
he
certainly
would
have
ruled
out
an
innate
propensity
to
extreme
hazards
for
in
his
judgment
it
was
this
innate
propensity
which
led
napoleon
to
abuse
the
higher
form
to
his
own
undoing
so
entirely
indeed
does
history
no
less
than
theory
fail
to
support
the
idea
of
the
one
answer
that
it
would
seem
that
even
in
germany
a
reaction
to
clausewitz
real
teaching
is
beginning
in
expounding
it
von
caemmerer
says
since
the
majority
of
the
most
prominent
military
authors
of
our
time
uphold
the
principle
that
in
war
our
efforts
must
always
be
directed
to
their
utmost
limits
and
that
a
deliberate
employment
of
lower
means
betrays
more
or
less
weakness
i
feel
bound
to
declare
that
the
wideness
of
clausewitz
views
have
inspired
me
with
a
high
degree
of
admiration
of
strategical
now
what
clausewitz
held
precisely
was
this
that
when
the
conditions
are
not
favourable
for
the
use
of
the
higher
form
the
seizure
of
a
small
part
of
the
enemy
territory
may
be
regarded
as
a
correct
alternative
to
destroying
his
armed
forces
but
he
clearly
regards
this
form
of
war
only
as
a
his
purely
continental
outlook
prevented
his
considering
that
there
might
be
cases
where
the
object
was
actually
so
limited
in
character
that
the
lower
form
of
war
would
be
at
once
the
more
effective
and
the
more
economical
to
use
in
continental
warfare
as
we
have
seen
such
cases
can
hardly
occur
but
they
tend
to
declare
themselves
strongly
when
the
maritime
factor
is
introduced
to
any
serious
extent
the
tendency
of
british
warfare
to
take
the
lower
or
limited
form
has
always
been
as
clearly
marked
as
is
the
opposite
tendency
on
the
continent
to
attribute
such
a
tendency
as
is
sometimes
the
fashion
to
an
inherent
lack
of
warlike
spirit
is
sufficiently
contradicted
by
the
results
it
has
achieved
there
is
no
reason
indeed
to
put
it
down
to
anything
but
a
sagacious
instinct
for
the
kind
of
war
that
best
accords
with
the
conditions
of
our
existence
so
strong
has
this
instinct
been
that
it
has
led
us
usually
to
apply
the
lower
form
not
only
where
the
object
of
the
war
was
a
territorial
one
but
to
cases
in
which
its
correctness
was
less
obvious
as
has
been
explained
in
the
last
chapter
we
have
applied
it
and
applied
it
on
the
whole
with
success
when
we
have
been
acting
in
concert
with
continental
allies
for
an
unlimited
object
where
that
is
the
common
object
has
been
the
overthrow
of
the
common
enemy
the
choice
between
the
two
forms
really
depends
upon
the
circumstances
of
each
case
we
have
to
consider
whether
the
political
object
is
in
fact
limited
whether
if
unlimited
in
the
abstract
it
can
be
reduced
to
a
concrete
object
that
is
limited
and
finally
whether
the
strategical
conditions
are
such
as
lend
themselves
to
the
successful
application
of
the
limited
form
what
we
require
now
is
to
determine
those
conditions
with
greater
exactness
and
this
will
be
best
done
by
changing
our
method
to
the
concrete
and
taking
a
leading
case
the
one
which
presents
them
in
their
clearest
and
simplest
form
is
without
doubt
the
recent
war
between
russia
and
japan
here
we
have
a
particularly
striking
example
of
a
small
power
having
forced
her
will
upon
a
much
greater
power
without
overthrowing
her
that
is
without
having
crushed
her
power
of
resistance
that
was
entirely
beyond
the
strength
of
japan
so
manifest
was
the
fact
that
everywhere
upon
the
continent
where
the
overthrow
of
your
enemy
was
regarded
as
the
only
admissible
form
of
war
the
action
of
the
japanese
in
resorting
to
hostilities
was
regarded
as
madness
only
in
england
with
her
tradition
and
instinct
for
what
an
island
power
may
achieve
by
the
lower
means
was
japan
considered
to
have
any
reasonable
chance
of
success
the
case
is
particularly
striking
for
every
one
felt
that
the
real
object
of
the
war
was
in
the
abstract
unlimited
that
it
was
in
fact
to
decide
whether
russia
or
japan
was
to
be
the
predominant
power
in
the
far
east
like
the
war
of
it
had
all
the
aspect
of
what
the
germans
call
a
trial
of
strength
such
a
war
is
one
which
above
all
appears
incapable
of
decision
except
by
the
complete
overthrow
of
the
one
power
or
the
other
there
was
no
complication
of
alliances
nor
any
expectation
of
them
the
treaty
had
isolated
the
struggle
if
ever
issue
hung
on
the
sheer
fighting
force
of
the
two
belligerents
it
would
seem
to
have
been
this
one
after
the
event
we
are
inclined
to
attribute
the
result
to
the
moral
qualities
and
superior
training
and
readiness
of
the
victors
these
qualities
indeed
played
their
part
and
they
must
not
be
minimised
but
who
will
contend
that
if
japan
had
tried
to
make
her
war
with
russia
as
napoleon
made
his
she
could
have
fared
even
as
well
as
he
did
she
had
no
such
preponderance
as
clausewitz
laid
down
as
a
condition
precedent
to
attempting
the
overthrow
of
her
enemy
the
employment
of
unlimited
war
fortunately
for
her
the
circumstances
did
not
call
for
the
employment
of
such
extreme
means
the
political
and
geographical
conditions
were
such
that
she
was
able
to
reduce
the
intangible
object
of
asserting
her
prestige
to
the
purely
concrete
form
of
a
territorial
objective
the
penetration
of
russia
into
manchuria
threatened
the
absorption
of
korea
into
the
russian
empire
and
this
japan
regarded
as
fatal
to
her
own
position
and
future
development
her
power
to
maintain
korean
integrity
would
be
the
outward
and
visible
sign
of
her
ability
to
assert
herself
as
a
pacific
power
her
abstract
quarrel
with
russia
could
therefore
be
crystallised
into
a
concrete
objective
in
the
same
way
as
the
quarrel
of
the
western
powers
with
russia
in
crystallised
into
the
concrete
objective
of
sebastopol
in
the
japanese
case
the
immediate
political
object
was
exceptionally
well
adapted
for
the
use
of
limited
war
owing
to
the
geographical
position
of
korea
and
to
the
vast
and
undeveloped
territories
which
separate
it
from
the
centre
of
russian
power
it
could
be
practically
isolated
by
naval
action
further
than
this
it
fulfilled
the
condition
to
which
clausewitz
attached
the
greatest
importance
that
is
to
say
the
seizure
of
the
particular
object
so
far
from
weakening
the
home
defence
of
japan
would
have
the
effect
of
greatly
increasing
the
strength
of
her
position
though
offensive
in
effect
and
intention
it
was
also
like
frederick
seizure
of
saxony
a
sound
piece
of
defensive
work
so
far
from
exposing
her
heart
it
served
to
cover
it
almost
impregnably
the
reason
is
plain
owing
to
the
wide
separation
of
the
two
russian
arsenals
at
port
arthur
and
vladivostock
with
a
defile
controlled
by
japan
interposed
the
russian
naval
position
was
very
faulty
the
only
way
of
correcting
it
was
for
russia
to
secure
a
base
in
the
straits
of
korea
and
for
this
she
had
been
striving
by
diplomatic
means
at
seoul
for
some
time
strategically
the
integrity
of
korea
was
for
japan
very
much
what
the
integrity
of
the
low
countries
was
for
us
but
in
the
case
of
the
low
countries
since
they
were
incapable
of
isolation
our
power
of
direct
action
was
always
comparatively
weak
portugal
with
its
unrivalled
strategical
harbour
at
lisbon
was
an
analogous
case
in
our
old
oceanic
wars
and
since
it
was
capable
of
being
in
a
measure
isolated
from
the
strength
of
our
great
rival
by
naval
means
we
were
there
almost
uniformly
successful
on
the
whole
it
must
be
said
that
notwithstanding
the
success
we
achieved
in
our
long
series
of
wars
waged
on
a
limited
basis
in
none
of
them
were
the
conditions
so
favourable
for
us
as
in
this
case
they
were
for
japan
in
none
of
them
did
our
main
offensive
movement
so
completely
secure
our
home
defence
canada
was
as
eccentric
as
possible
to
our
line
of
home
defence
while
in
the
crimea
so
completely
did
our
offensive
uncover
the
british
islands
that
we
had
to
supplement
our
movement
against
the
limited
object
by
sending
our
main
fighting
fleet
to
hold
the
exit
of
the
baltic
against
the
danger
of
an
unlimited
the
strategical
object
with
which
the
baltic
fleet
was
sent
was
certainly
to
prevent
a
that
is
its
main
function
in
our
war
plan
was
negative
its
positive
function
was
minor
and
diversionary
only
it
also
had
a
political
object
as
a
demonstration
to
further
our
efforts
to
form
a
baltic
coalition
against
russia
which
entirely
failed
public
opinion
mistaking
the
whole
situation
expected
direct
positive
results
from
this
fleet
even
the
capture
of
petersburg
such
an
operation
would
have
converted
the
war
from
a
limited
one
to
an
unlimited
one
it
would
have
meant
the
overthrow
of
the
enemy
a
task
quite
beyond
the
strength
of
the
allies
without
the
assistance
of
the
baltic
powers
and
even
so
their
assistance
would
not
have
justified
changing
the
nature
of
the
war
unless
both
sweden
and
russia
had
been
ready
to
make
unlimited
war
and
nothing
was
further
from
their
intention
whether
or
not
it
was
on
this
principle
that
the
japanese
conceived
the
war
from
the
outset
matters
little
the
main
considerations
are
that
with
so
favourable
a
territorial
object
as
korea
limited
war
was
possible
in
its
most
formidable
shape
that
the
war
did
in
fact
develop
on
limited
lines
and
that
it
was
entirely
successful
without
waiting
to
secure
the
command
of
the
sea
japan
opened
by
a
surprise
seizure
of
seoul
and
then
under
cover
of
minor
operations
of
the
fleet
proceeded
to
complete
her
occupation
of
korea
as
she
faced
the
second
stage
that
of
making
good
the
defence
of
her
conquest
the
admirable
nature
of
her
geographical
object
was
further
displayed
the
theoretical
weakness
of
limited
war
at
this
point
is
the
arrest
of
your
offensive
action
but
in
this
case
such
arrest
was
neither
necessary
nor
possible
and
for
these
reasons
to
render
the
conquest
secure
not
only
must
the
korean
frontier
be
made
inviolable
but
korea
must
be
permanently
isolated
by
sea
this
involved
the
destruction
of
the
russian
fleet
and
this
in
its
turn
entailed
the
reduction
of
port
arthur
by
military
means
here
then
in
the
second
stage
japan
found
herself
committed
to
two
lines
of
operation
with
two
distinct
objectives
port
arthur
and
the
russian
army
that
was
slowly
concentrating
in
manchuria
a
thoroughly
vicious
situation
so
fortunate
however
was
the
geographical
conformation
of
the
theatre
that
by
promptitude
and
the
bold
use
of
an
uncommanded
sea
it
could
be
reduced
to
something
far
more
correct
by
continuing
the
advance
of
the
korean
army
into
manchuria
and
landing
another
force
between
it
and
the
port
arthur
army
the
three
corps
could
be
concentrated
and
the
vicious
separation
of
the
lines
of
operations
turned
to
good
account
they
could
be
combined
in
such
a
way
as
to
threaten
an
enveloping
on
before
the
russian
offensive
concentration
could
be
completed
not
only
was
the
russian
point
of
concentration
but
it
also
was
a
sound
position
both
for
defending
korea
and
covering
the
siege
of
port
arthur
once
secured
it
gave
the
japanese
all
the
advantages
of
defence
and
forced
the
russians
to
exhaust
themselves
in
offensive
operations
which
were
beyond
their
strength
nor
was
it
only
ashore
that
this
advantage
was
gained
the
success
of
the
system
which
culminated
in
the
fall
of
port
arthur
went
further
still
not
only
did
it
make
japan
relatively
superior
at
sea
but
it
enabled
her
to
assume
a
naval
defensive
and
so
to
force
the
final
naval
decision
on
russia
with
every
advantage
of
time
place
and
strength
in
her
own
favour
by
the
battle
of
tsushima
the
territorial
object
was
completely
isolated
by
sea
and
the
position
of
japan
in
korea
was
rendered
as
impregnable
as
that
of
wellington
at
torres
vedras
all
that
remained
was
to
proceed
to
the
third
stage
and
demonstrate
to
russia
that
the
acceptance
of
the
situation
that
had
been
set
up
was
more
to
her
advantage
than
the
further
attempt
to
break
it
down
this
the
final
advance
to
mukden
accomplished
and
japan
obtained
her
end
very
far
short
of
having
overthrown
her
enemy
the
offensive
power
of
russia
had
never
been
so
strong
while
that
of
japan
was
almost
if
not
quite
exhausted
approached
in
this
way
the
far
eastern
struggle
is
seen
to
develop
on
the
same
lines
as
all
our
great
maritime
wars
of
the
past
which
continental
strategists
have
so
persistently
excluded
from
their
field
of
study
it
presents
the
normal
three
phases
the
initial
offensive
movement
to
seize
the
territorial
object
the
secondary
phase
which
forces
an
attenuated
offensive
on
the
enemy
and
the
final
stage
of
pressure
in
which
there
is
a
return
to
the
offensive
according
as
jomini
puts
it
to
circumstances
and
your
relative
force
in
order
to
obtain
the
cession
desired
it
must
not
of
course
be
asked
that
these
phases
shall
be
always
clearly
defined
strategical
analysis
can
never
give
exact
results
it
aims
only
at
approximations
at
groupings
which
will
serve
to
guide
but
will
always
leave
much
to
the
judgment
the
three
phases
in
the
war
though
unusually
well
defined
continually
overlapped
it
must
be
so
for
in
war
the
effect
of
an
operation
is
never
confined
to
the
limits
of
its
immediate
or
primary
intention
thus
the
occupation
of
korea
had
the
secondary
defensive
effect
of
covering
the
home
country
while
the
initial
blow
which
admiral
togo
delivered
at
port
arthur
to
cover
the
primary
offensive
movement
proved
by
the
demoralisation
it
caused
in
the
russian
fleet
to
be
a
distinct
step
in
the
secondary
phase
of
isolating
the
conquest
in
the
later
stages
of
the
war
the
line
between
what
was
essential
to
set
up
the
second
phase
of
perfecting
the
isolation
and
the
third
phase
of
general
pressure
seems
to
have
grown
very
nebulous
it
was
at
this
stage
that
the
japanese
strategy
has
been
most
severely
criticised
and
it
was
just
here
they
seem
to
have
lost
hold
of
the
conception
of
a
limited
war
if
in
fact
they
had
ever
securely
grasped
the
conception
as
the
elder
pitt
understood
it
it
has
been
argued
that
in
their
eagerness
to
deal
a
blow
at
the
enemy
main
army
they
neglected
to
devote
sufficient
force
to
reduce
port
arthur
an
essential
step
to
complete
the
second
phase
whether
or
not
the
exigencies
of
the
case
rendered
such
distribution
of
force
inevitable
or
whether
it
was
due
to
miscalculation
of
difficulties
the
result
was
a
most
costly
for
not
only
did
it
entail
a
vast
loss
of
time
and
life
at
port
arthur
itself
but
when
the
sortie
of
the
russian
fleet
in
june
brought
home
to
them
their
error
the
offensive
movement
on
had
to
be
delayed
and
the
opportunity
passed
for
a
decisive
at
the
concentration
ashore
this
misfortune
which
was
to
cost
the
japanese
so
dear
may
perhaps
be
attributed
at
least
in
part
to
the
continental
influences
under
which
their
army
had
been
trained
we
at
least
can
trace
the
unlimited
outlook
in
the
pages
of
the
german
staff
history
in
dealing
with
the
japanese
plan
of
operations
it
is
assumed
that
the
occupation
of
korea
and
the
isolation
of
port
arthur
were
but
preliminaries
to
a
concentric
advance
on
which
was
kept
in
view
as
the
first
objective
of
the
operations
on
land
but
surely
on
every
theory
of
the
war
the
first
objective
of
the
japanese
on
land
was
seoul
where
they
expected
to
have
to
fight
their
first
important
action
against
troops
advancing
from
the
yalu
and
surely
their
second
was
port
arthur
with
its
fleet
and
arsenal
which
they
expected
to
reduce
with
little
more
difficulty
than
they
had
met
with
ten
years
before
against
the
chinese
such
at
least
was
the
actual
progression
of
events
and
a
criticism
which
regards
operations
of
such
magnitude
and
ultimate
importance
as
mere
incidents
of
strategic
deployment
is
only
to
be
explained
by
the
domination
of
the
napoleonic
idea
of
war
against
the
universal
application
of
which
clausewitz
so
solemnly
protested
it
is
the
work
of
men
who
have
a
natural
difficulty
in
conceiving
a
war
plan
that
does
not
culminate
in
a
jena
or
a
sedan
it
is
a
view
surely
which
is
the
child
of
theory
bearing
no
relation
to
the
actuality
of
the
war
in
question
and
affording
no
explanation
of
its
ultimate
success
the
truth
is
that
so
long
as
the
japanese
acted
on
the
principles
of
limited
war
as
laid
down
by
clausewitz
and
jomini
and
plainly
deducible
from
our
own
rich
experience
they
progressed
beyond
all
their
expectations
but
so
soon
as
they
departed
from
them
and
suffered
themselves
to
be
confused
with
continental
theories
they
were
surprised
by
unaccountable
failure
the
expression
limited
war
is
no
doubt
not
entirely
happy
yet
no
other
has
been
found
to
condense
the
ideas
of
limited
object
and
limited
interest
which
are
its
special
characteristics
still
if
the
above
example
be
kept
in
mind
as
a
typical
case
the
meaning
of
the
term
will
not
be
mistaken
it
only
remains
to
emphasise
one
important
point
the
fact
that
the
doctrine
of
limited
war
traverses
the
current
belief
that
our
primary
objective
must
always
be
the
enemy
armed
forces
is
liable
to
carry
with
it
a
false
inference
that
it
also
rejects
the
corollary
that
war
means
the
use
of
battles
nothing
is
further
from
the
conception
whatever
the
form
of
war
there
is
no
likelihood
of
our
ever
going
back
to
the
old
fallacy
of
attempting
to
decide
wars
by
manoeuvres
all
forms
alike
demand
the
use
of
battles
by
our
fundamental
theory
war
is
always
a
continuation
of
political
intercourse
in
which
fighting
is
substituted
for
writing
notes
however
great
the
controlling
influence
of
the
political
object
it
must
never
obscure
the
fact
that
it
is
by
fighting
we
have
to
gain
our
end
it
is
the
more
necessary
to
insist
on
this
point
for
the
idea
of
making
a
piece
of
territory
your
object
is
liable
to
be
confused
with
the
older
method
of
conducting
war
in
which
armies
were
content
to
manoeuvre
for
strategical
positions
and
a
battle
came
almost
to
be
regarded
as
a
mark
of
bad
generalship
with
such
parading
limited
war
has
nothing
to
do
its
conduct
differs
only
from
that
of
unlimited
war
in
that
instead
of
having
to
destroy
our
enemy
whole
power
of
resistance
we
need
only
overthrow
so
much
of
his
active
force
as
he
is
able
or
willing
to
bring
to
bear
in
order
to
prevent
or
terminate
our
occupation
of
the
territorial
object
the
first
consideration
then
in
entering
on
such
a
war
is
to
endeavour
to
determine
what
the
force
will
amount
to
it
will
depend
firstly
on
the
importance
the
enemy
attaches
to
the
limited
object
coupled
with
the
nature
and
extent
of
his
preoccupations
elsewhere
and
secondly
it
will
depend
upon
the
natural
difficulties
of
his
lines
of
communication
and
the
extent
to
which
we
can
increase
those
difficulties
by
our
conduct
of
the
initial
operations
in
favourable
circumstances
therefore
and
here
lies
the
great
value
of
the
limited
form
we
are
able
to
control
the
amount
of
force
we
shall
have
to
encounter
the
most
favourable
circumstances
and
the
only
circumstances
by
which
we
ourselves
can
profit
are
such
as
permit
the
more
or
less
complete
isolation
of
the
object
by
naval
action
and
such
isolation
can
never
be
established
until
we
have
entirely
overthrown
the
enemy
naval
forces
here
then
we
enter
the
field
of
naval
strategy
we
can
now
leave
behind
us
the
theory
of
war
in
general
and
in
order
to
pave
the
way
to
our
final
conclusions
devote
our
attention
to
the
theory
of
naval
warfare
in
particular
part
two
theory
of
naval
war
chapter
one
theory
of
the
object
command
of
the
sea
the
object
of
naval
warfare
must
always
be
directly
or
indirectly
either
to
secure
the
command
of
the
sea
or
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
securing
it
the
second
part
of
the
proposition
should
be
noted
with
special
care
in
order
to
exclude
a
habit
of
thought
which
is
one
of
the
commonest
sources
of
error
in
naval
speculation
that
error
is
the
very
general
assumption
that
if
one
belligerent
loses
the
command
of
the
sea
it
passes
at
once
to
the
other
belligerent
the
most
cursory
study
of
naval
history
is
enough
to
reveal
the
falseness
of
such
an
assumption
it
tells
us
that
the
most
common
situation
in
naval
war
is
that
neither
side
has
the
command
that
the
normal
position
is
not
a
commanded
sea
but
an
uncommanded
sea
the
mere
assertion
which
no
one
denies
that
the
object
of
naval
warfare
is
to
get
command
of
the
sea
actually
connotes
the
proposition
that
the
command
is
normally
in
dispute
it
is
this
state
of
dispute
with
which
naval
strategy
is
most
nearly
concerned
for
when
the
command
is
lost
or
won
pure
naval
strategy
comes
to
an
end
this
truth
is
so
obvious
that
it
would
scarcely
be
worth
mentioning
were
it
not
for
the
constant
recurrence
of
such
phrases
as
if
england
were
to
lose
command
of
the
sea
it
would
be
all
over
with
her
the
fallacy
of
the
idea
is
that
it
ignores
the
power
of
the
strategical
defensive
it
assumes
that
if
in
the
face
of
some
extraordinary
hostile
coalition
or
through
some
extraordinary
mischance
we
found
ourselves
without
sufficient
strength
to
keep
the
command
we
should
therefore
be
too
weak
to
prevent
the
enemy
getting
it
a
negation
of
the
whole
theory
of
war
which
at
least
requires
further
support
than
it
ever
receives
and
not
only
is
this
assumption
a
negation
of
theory
it
is
a
negation
both
of
practical
experience
and
of
the
expressed
opinion
of
our
greatest
masters
we
ourselves
have
used
the
defensive
at
sea
with
success
as
under
william
the
third
and
in
the
war
of
american
independence
while
in
our
long
wars
with
france
she
habitually
used
it
in
such
a
way
that
sometimes
for
years
though
we
had
a
substantial
preponderance
we
could
not
get
command
and
for
years
were
unable
to
carry
out
our
war
plan
without
serious
interruption
from
her
fleet
so
far
from
the
defensive
being
a
negligible
factor
at
sea
or
even
the
mere
pestilent
heresy
it
is
generally
represented
it
is
of
course
inherent
in
all
war
and
as
we
have
seen
the
paramount
questions
of
strategy
both
at
sea
and
on
land
turn
on
the
relative
possibilities
of
offensive
and
defensive
and
upon
the
relative
proportions
in
which
each
should
enter
into
our
plan
of
war
at
sea
the
most
powerful
and
belligerent
can
no
more
avoid
his
alternating
periods
of
defence
which
result
from
inevitable
arrests
of
offensive
action
than
they
can
be
avoided
on
land
the
defensive
then
has
to
be
considered
but
before
we
are
in
a
position
to
do
so
with
profit
we
have
to
proceed
with
our
analysis
of
the
phrase
command
of
the
sea
and
ascertain
exactly
what
it
is
we
mean
by
it
in
war
in
the
first
place
command
of
the
sea
is
not
identical
in
its
strategical
conditions
with
the
conquest
of
territory
you
can
not
argue
from
the
one
to
the
other
as
has
been
too
commonly
done
such
phrases
as
the
conquest
of
water
territory
and
making
the
enemy
coast
our
frontier
had
their
use
and
meaning
in
the
mouths
of
those
who
framed
them
but
they
are
really
little
but
rhetorical
expressions
founded
on
false
analogy
and
false
analogy
is
not
a
secure
basis
for
a
theory
of
war
the
analogy
is
false
for
two
reasons
both
of
which
enter
materially
into
the
conduct
of
naval
war
you
can
not
conquer
sea
because
it
is
not
susceptible
of
ownership
at
least
outside
territorial
waters
you
can
not
as
lawyers
say
reduce
it
into
possession
because
you
can
not
exclude
neutrals
from
it
as
you
can
from
territory
you
conquer
in
the
second
place
you
can
not
subsist
your
armed
force
upon
it
as
you
can
upon
territory
clearly
then
to
make
deductions
from
an
assumption
that
command
of
the
sea
is
analogous
to
conquest
of
territory
is
unscientific
and
certain
to
lead
to
error
the
only
safe
method
is
to
inquire
what
it
is
we
can
secure
for
ourselves
and
what
it
is
we
can
deny
the
enemy
by
command
of
the
sea
now
if
we
exclude
fishery
rights
which
are
irrelevant
to
the
present
matter
the
only
right
we
or
our
enemy
can
have
on
the
sea
is
the
right
of
passage
in
other
words
the
only
positive
value
which
the
high
seas
have
for
national
life
is
as
a
means
of
communication
for
the
active
life
of
a
nation
such
means
may
stand
for
much
or
it
may
stand
for
little
but
to
every
maritime
state
it
has
some
value
consequently
by
denying
an
enemy
this
means
of
passage
we
check
the
movement
of
his
national
life
at
sea
in
the
same
kind
of
way
that
we
check
it
on
land
by
occupying
his
territory
so
far
the
analogy
holds
good
but
no
further
so
much
for
the
positive
value
which
the
sea
has
in
national
life
it
has
also
a
negative
value
for
not
only
is
it
a
means
of
communication
but
unlike
the
means
of
communication
ashore
it
is
also
a
barrier
by
winning
command
of
the
sea
we
remove
that
barrier
from
our
own
path
thereby
placing
ourselves
in
position
to
exert
direct
military
pressure
upon
the
national
life
of
our
enemy
ashore
while
at
the
same
time
we
solidify
it
against
him
and
prevent
his
exerting
direct
military
pressure
upon
ourselves
command
of
the
sea
therefore
means
nothing
but
the
control
of
maritime
communications
whether
for
commercial
or
military
purposes
the
object
of
naval
warfare
is
the
control
of
communications
and
not
as
in
land
warfare
the
conquest
of
territory
the
difference
is
fundamental
true
it
is
rightly
said
that
strategy
ashore
is
mainly
a
question
of
communications
but
they
are
communications
in
another
sense
the
phrase
refers
to
the
communications
of
the
army
alone
and
not
to
the
wider
communications
which
are
part
of
the
life
of
the
nation
but
on
land
also
there
are
communications
of
a
kind
which
are
essential
to
national
life
the
internal
communications
which
connect
the
points
of
distribution
here
again
we
touch
an
analogy
between
the
two
kinds
of
war
land
warfare
as
the
most
devoted
adherents
of
the
modern
view
admit
can
not
attain
its
end
by
military
victories
alone
the
destruction
of
your
enemy
forces
will
not
avail
for
certain
unless
you
have
in
reserve
sufficient
force
to
complete
the
occupation
of
his
inland
communications
and
principal
points
of
distribution
this
power
is
the
real
fruit
of
victory
the
power
to
strangle
the
whole
national
life
it
is
not
until
this
is
done
that
a
nation
whose
whole
heart
is
in
the
war
will
consent
to
make
peace
and
do
your
will
it
is
precisely
in
the
same
way
that
the
command
of
the
sea
works
towards
peace
though
of
course
in
a
far
less
coercive
manner
against
a
continental
state
by
occupying
her
maritime
communications
and
closing
the
points
of
distribution
in
which
they
terminate
we
destroy
the
national
life
afloat
and
thereby
check
the
vitality
of
that
life
ashore
so
far
as
the
one
is
dependent
on
the
other
thus
we
see
that
so
long
as
we
retain
the
power
and
right
to
stop
maritime
communications
the
analogy
between
command
of
the
sea
and
the
conquest
of
territory
is
in
this
aspect
very
close
and
the
analogy
is
of
the
utmost
practical
importance
for
on
it
turns
the
most
burning
question
of
maritime
war
which
it
will
be
well
to
deal
with
in
this
place
it
is
obvious
that
if
the
object
and
end
of
naval
warfare
is
the
control
of
communications
it
must
carry
with
it
the
right
to
forbid
if
we
can
the
passage
of
both
public
and
private
property
upon
the
sea
now
the
only
means
we
have
of
enforcing
such
control
of
commercial
communications
at
sea
is
in
the
last
resort
the
capture
or
destruction
of
property
such
capture
or
destruction
is
the
penalty
which
we
impose
upon
our
enemy
for
attempting
to
use
the
communications
of
which
he
does
not
hold
the
control
in
the
language
of
jurisprudence
it
is
the
ultimate
sanction
of
the
interdict
which
we
are
seeking
to
enforce
the
current
term
commerce
destruction
is
not
in
fact
a
logical
expression
of
the
strategical
idea
to
make
the
position
clear
we
should
say
commerce
prevention
the
methods
of
this
commerce
prevention
have
no
more
connection
with
the
old
and
barbarous
idea
of
plunder
and
reprisal
than
orderly
requisitions
ashore
have
with
the
old
idea
of
plunder
and
ravaging
no
form
of
war
indeed
causes
so
little
human
suffering
as
the
capture
of
property
at
sea
it
is
more
akin
to
process
of
law
such
as
distress
for
rent
or
execution
of
judgment
or
arrest
of
a
ship
than
to
a
military
operation
once
it
is
true
it
was
not
so
in
the
days
of
privateers
it
was
accompanied
too
often
and
particularly
in
the
mediterranean
and
the
west
indies
with
lamentable
cruelty
and
lawlessness
and
the
existence
of
such
abuses
was
the
real
reason
for
the
general
agreement
to
the
declaration
of
paris
by
which
privateering
was
abolished
but
it
was
not
the
only
reason
the
idea
of
privateering
was
a
survival
of
a
primitive
and
unscientific
conception
of
war
which
was
governed
mainly
by
a
general
notion
of
doing
your
enemy
as
much
damage
as
possible
and
making
reprisal
for
wrongs
he
had
done
you
to
the
same
class
of
ideas
belonged
the
practice
of
plunder
and
ravaging
ashore
but
neither
of
these
methods
of
war
was
abolished
for
humanitarian
reasons
they
disappeared
indeed
as
a
general
practice
before
the
world
had
begun
to
talk
of
humanity
they
were
abolished
because
war
became
more
scientific
the
right
to
plunder
and
ravage
was
not
denied
but
plunder
was
found
to
demoralise
your
troops
and
unfit
them
for
fighting
and
ravaging
proved
to
be
a
less
powerful
means
of
coercing
your
enemy
than
exploiting
the
occupied
country
by
means
of
regular
requisitions
for
the
supply
of
your
own
army
and
the
increase
of
its
offensive
range
in
short
the
reform
arose
from
a
desire
to
husband
your
enemy
resources
for
your
own
use
instead
of
wantonly
wasting
them
in
a
similar
way
privateering
always
had
a
debilitating
effect
upon
our
own
regular
force
it
greatly
increased
the
difficulty
of
manning
the
navy
and
the
occasional
large
profits
had
a
demoralising
influence
on
detached
cruiser
commanders
it
tended
to
keep
alive
the
mediaeval
corsair
spirit
at
the
expense
of
the
modern
military
spirit
which
made
for
direct
operations
against
the
enemy
armed
forces
it
was
inevitable
that
as
the
new
movement
of
opinion
gathered
force
it
should
carry
with
it
a
conviction
that
for
operating
against
trade
sporadic
attack
could
never
be
so
efficient
as
an
organised
system
of
operations
to
secure
a
real
strategical
control
of
the
enemy
maritime
communications
a
riper
and
sounder
view
of
war
revealed
that
what
may
be
called
tactical
commercial
blockade
that
is
the
blockade
of
ports
could
be
extended
to
and
supplemented
by
a
strategical
blockade
of
the
great
trade
routes
in
moral
principle
there
is
no
difference
between
the
two
admit
the
principle
of
tactical
or
close
blockade
and
as
between
belligerents
you
can
not
condemn
the
principle
of
strategical
or
distant
blockade
except
in
their
effect
upon
neutrals
there
is
no
juridical
difference
between
the
two
why
indeed
should
this
humane
yet
drastic
process
of
war
be
rejected
at
sea
if
the
same
thing
is
permitted
on
land
if
on
land
you
allow
contributions
and
requisitions
if
you
permit
the
occupation
of
towns
ports
and
inland
communications
without
which
no
conquest
is
complete
and
no
effective
war
possible
why
should
you
refuse
similar
procedure
at
sea
where
it
causes
far
less
individual
suffering
if
you
refuse
the
right
of
controlling
communications
at
sea
you
must
also
refuse
the
right
on
land
if
you
admit
the
right
of
contributions
on
land
you
must
admit
the
right
of
capture
at
sea
otherwise
you
will
permit
to
military
powers
the
extreme
rights
of
war
and
leave
to
the
maritime
powers
no
effective
rights
at
all
their
ultimate
argument
would
be
gone
in
so
far
as
the
idea
of
abolishing
private
capture
at
sea
is
humanitarian
and
in
so
far
as
it
rests
on
a
belief
that
it
would
strengthen
our
position
as
a
commercial
maritime
state
let
it
be
honourably
dealt
with
but
so
far
as
its
advocates
have
as
yet
expressed
themselves
the
proposal
appears
to
be
based
on
two
fallacies
one
is
that
you
can
avoid
attack
by
depriving
yourself
of
the
power
of
offence
and
resting
on
defence
alone
and
the
other
the
idea
that
war
consists
entirely
of
battles
between
armies
or
fleets
it
ignores
the
fundamental
fact
that
battles
are
only
the
means
of
enabling
you
to
do
that
which
really
brings
wars
to
an
is
to
exert
pressure
on
the
citizens
and
their
collective
life
after
shattering
the
hostile
main
army
says
von
der
goltz
we
still
have
the
forcing
of
a
peace
as
a
separate
and
in
certain
circumstances
a
more
difficult
task
to
make
the
enemy
country
feel
the
burdens
of
war
with
such
weight
that
the
desire
for
peace
will
prevail
this
is
the
point
in
which
napoleon
failed
it
may
be
necessary
to
seize
the
harbours
commercial
centres
important
lines
of
traffic
fortifications
and
arsenals
in
other
words
all
important
property
necessary
to
the
existence
of
the
people
and
army
if
then
we
are
deprived
of
the
right
to
use
analogous
means
at
sea
the
object
for
which
we
fight
battles
almost
ceases
to
exist
defeat
the
enemy
fleets
as
we
may
he
will
be
but
little
the
worse
we
shall
have
opened
the
way
for
invasion
but
any
of
the
great
continental
powers
can
laugh
at
our
attempts
to
invade
if
we
can
not
reap
the
harvest
of
our
success
by
deadening
his
national
activities
at
sea
the
only
legitimate
means
of
pressure
within
our
strength
will
be
denied
us
our
fleet
if
it
would
proceed
with
such
secondary
operations
as
are
essential
for
forcing
a
peace
will
be
driven
to
such
barbarous
expedients
as
the
bombardment
of
seaport
towns
and
destructive
raids
upon
the
hostile
coasts
if
the
means
of
pressure
which
follow
successful
fighting
were
abolished
both
on
land
and
sea
there
would
be
this
argument
in
favour
of
the
change
that
it
would
mean
perhaps
for
civilised
states
the
entire
cessation
of
war
for
war
would
become
so
impotent
that
no
one
would
care
to
engage
in
it
it
would
be
an
affair
between
regular
armies
and
fleets
with
which
the
people
had
little
concern
international
quarrels
would
tend
to
take
the
form
of
the
mediaeval
private
disputes
which
were
settled
by
champions
in
trial
by
battle
an
absurdity
which
led
rapidly
to
the
domination
of
purely
legal
procedure
if
international
quarrels
could
go
the
same
way
humanity
would
have
advanced
a
long
stride
but
the
world
is
scarcely
ripe
for
such
a
revolution
meanwhile
to
abolish
the
right
of
interference
with
the
flow
of
private
property
at
sea
without
abolishing
the
corresponding
right
ashore
would
only
defeat
the
ends
of
humanitarians
the
great
deterrent
the
most
powerful
check
on
war
would
be
gone
it
is
commerce
and
finance
which
now
more
than
ever
control
or
check
the
foreign
policy
of
nations
if
commerce
and
finance
stand
to
lose
by
war
their
influence
for
a
peaceful
solution
will
be
great
and
so
long
as
the
right
of
private
capture
at
sea
exists
they
stand
to
lose
in
every
maritime
war
immediately
and
inevitably
whatever
the
ultimate
result
may
be
abolish
the
right
and
this
deterrent
disappears
nay
they
will
even
stand
to
win
immediate
gains
owing
to
the
sudden
expansion
of
government
expenditure
which
the
hostilities
will
entail
and
the
expansion
of
sea
commerce
which
the
needs
of
the
armed
forces
will
create
any
such
losses
as
maritime
warfare
under
existing
conditions
must
immediately
inflict
will
be
remote
if
interference
with
property
is
confined
to
the
land
they
will
never
indeed
be
serious
except
in
the
case
of
complete
defeat
and
no
one
enters
upon
war
expecting
defeat
it
is
in
the
hope
of
victory
and
gain
that
aggressive
wars
are
born
the
fear
of
quick
and
certain
loss
is
their
surest
preventive
humanity
then
will
surely
beware
how
in
a
too
hasty
pursuit
of
peaceful
ideals
it
lets
drop
the
best
weapon
it
has
for
scotching
the
evil
it
has
as
yet
no
power
to
kill
in
what
follows
therefore
it
is
intended
to
regard
the
right
of
private
capture
at
sea
as
still
subsisting
without
it
indeed
naval
warfare
is
almost
inconceivable
and
in
any
case
no
one
has
any
experience
of
such
a
truncated
method
of
war
on
which
profitable
study
can
be
founded
the
primary
method
then
in
which
we
use
victory
or
preponderance
at
sea
and
bring
it
to
bear
on
the
enemy
population
to
secure
peace
is
by
the
capture
or
destruction
of
the
enemy
property
whether
public
or
private
but
in
comparing
the
process
with
the
analogous
occupation
of
territory
and
the
levying
of
contributions
and
requisitions
we
have
to
observe
a
marked
difference
both
processes
are
what
may
be
called
economic
pressure
but
ashore
the
economic
pressure
can
only
be
exerted
as
the
consequence
of
victory
or
acquired
domination
by
military
success
at
sea
the
process
begins
at
once
indeed
more
often
than
not
the
first
act
of
hostility
in
maritime
wars
has
been
the
capture
of
private
property
at
sea
in
a
sense
this
is
also
true
ashore
the
first
step
of
an
invader
after
crossing
the
frontier
will
be
to
control
to
a
less
or
greater
extent
such
private
property
as
he
is
able
to
use
for
his
purposes
but
such
interference
with
private
property
is
essentially
a
military
act
and
does
not
belong
to
the
secondary
phase
of
economic
pressure
at
sea
it
does
and
the
reason
why
this
should
be
so
lies
in
certain
fundamental
differences
between
land
and
sea
warfare
which
are
implicit
in
the
communication
theory
of
naval
war
to
elucidate
the
point
it
must
be
repeated
that
maritime
communications
which
are
the
root
of
the
idea
of
command
of
the
sea
are
not
analogous
to
military
communications
in
the
ordinary
use
of
the
term
military
communications
refer
solely
to
the
army
lines
of
supply
and
retreat
maritime
communications
have
a
wider
meaning
though
in
effect
embracing
the
lines
of
fleet
supply
they
correspond
in
strategical
values
not
to
military
lines
of
supply
but
to
those
internal
lines
of
communication
by
which
the
flow
of
national
life
is
maintained
ashore
consequently
maritime
communications
are
on
a
wholly
different
footing
from
land
communications
at
sea
the
communications
are
for
the
most
part
common
to
both
belligerents
whereas
ashore
each
possesses
his
own
in
his
own
territory
the
strategical
effect
is
of
importance
for
it
means
that
at
sea
strategical
offence
and
defence
tend
to
merge
in
a
way
that
is
unknown
ashore
since
maritime
communications
are
common
we
as
a
rule
can
not
attack
those
of
the
enemy
without
defending
our
own
in
military
operations
the
converse
is
the
rule
normally
an
attack
on
our
enemy
communications
tends
to
expose
their
own
the
theory
of
common
communications
will
become
clear
by
taking
an
example
in
our
wars
with
france
our
communications
with
the
mediterranean
india
and
america
ran
down
from
the
channel
mouth
past
finisterre
and
vincent
and
those
of
france
at
least
from
her
atlantic
ports
were
identical
for
almost
their
entire
distance
in
our
wars
with
the
dutch
the
identity
was
even
closer
even
in
the
case
of
spain
her
great
trade
routes
followed
the
same
lines
as
our
own
for
the
greater
part
of
their
extent
consequently
the
opening
moves
which
we
generally
made
to
defend
our
trade
by
the
occupation
of
those
lines
placed
us
in
a
position
to
attack
our
enemy
trade
the
same
situation
arose
even
when
our
opening
dispositions
were
designed
as
defence
against
home
invasion
or
against
attacks
upon
our
colonies
for
the
positions
our
fleet
had
to
take
up
to
those
ends
always
lay
on
or
about
the
terminal
and
focal
points
of
trade
routes
whether
our
immediate
object
were
to
bring
the
enemy
main
fleets
to
action
or
to
exercise
economic
pressure
it
made
but
little
difference
if
the
enemy
were
equally
anxious
to
engage
it
was
at
one
of
the
terminal
or
focal
areas
we
were
almost
certain
to
get
contact
if
he
wished
to
avoid
a
decision
the
best
way
to
force
him
to
action
was
to
occupy
his
trade
routes
at
the
same
vital
points
thus
it
comes
about
that
whereas
on
land
the
process
of
economic
pressure
at
least
in
the
modern
conception
of
war
should
only
begin
after
decisive
victory
at
sea
it
starts
automatically
from
the
first
indeed
such
pressure
may
be
the
only
means
of
forcing
the
decision
we
seek
as
will
appear
more
clearly
when
we
come
to
deal
with
the
other
fundamental
difference
between
land
and
sea
warfare
meanwhile
we
may
note
that
at
sea
the
use
of
economic
pressure
from
the
commencement
is
justified
for
two
reasons
the
first
is
as
we
have
seen
that
it
is
an
economy
of
means
to
use
our
defensive
positions
for
attack
when
attack
does
not
vitiate
those
positions
and
it
will
not
vitiate
them
if
fleet
cruisers
operate
with
restraint
the
second
is
that
interference
with
the
enemy
trade
has
two
aspects
it
is
not
only
a
means
of
exerting
the
secondary
economic
pressure
it
is
also
a
primary
means
towards
overthrowing
the
enemy
power
of
resistance
wars
are
not
decided
exclusively
by
military
and
naval
force
finance
is
scarcely
less
important
when
other
things
are
equal
it
is
the
longer
purse
that
wins
it
has
even
many
times
redressed
an
unfavourable
balance
of
armed
force
and
given
victory
to
the
physically
weaker
power
anything
therefore
which
we
are
able
to
achieve
towards
crippling
our
enemy
finance
is
a
direct
step
to
his
overthrow
and
the
most
effective
means
we
can
employ
to
this
end
against
a
maritime
state
is
to
deny
him
the
resources
of
seaborne
trade
it
will
be
seen
therefore
that
in
naval
warfare
however
closely
we
may
concentrate
our
efforts
on
the
destruction
of
our
enemy
armed
forces
as
the
direct
means
to
his
overthrow
it
would
be
folly
to
stay
our
hands
when
opportunities
occur
as
they
will
automatically
for
undermining
his
financial
position
on
which
the
continued
vigour
of
those
armed
forces
so
largely
depends
thus
the
occupation
of
our
enemy
sea
communications
and
the
confiscatory
operations
it
connotes
are
in
a
sense
primary
operations
and
not
as
on
land
secondary
such
then
are
the
abstract
conclusions
at
which
we
arrive
in
our
attempt
to
analyse
the
idea
of
command
of
the
sea
and
to
give
it
precision
as
the
control
of
common
communications
their
concrete
value
will
appear
when
we
come
to
deal
with
the
various
forms
which
naval
operations
may
take
such
as
seeking
out
the
enemy
fleet
blockade
attack
and
defence
of
trade
and
the
safeguarding
of
combined
expeditions
for
the
present
it
remains
to
deal
with
the
various
kinds
of
sea
command
which
flow
from
the
communication
idea
if
the
object
of
the
command
of
the
sea
is
to
control
communications
it
is
obvious
it
may
exist
in
various
degrees
we
may
be
able
to
control
the
whole
of
the
common
communications
as
the
result
either
of
great
initial
preponderance
or
of
decisive
victory
if
we
are
not
sufficiently
strong
to
do
this
we
may
still
be
able
to
control
some
of
the
communications
that
is
our
control
may
be
general
or
local
obvious
as
the
point
is
it
needs
emphasising
because
of
a
maxim
that
has
become
current
that
the
sea
is
all
one
like
other
maxims
of
the
kind
it
conveys
a
truth
with
a
trail
of
error
in
its
wake
the
truth
it
contains
seems
to
be
simply
this
that
as
a
rule
local
control
can
only
avail
us
temporarily
for
so
long
as
the
enemy
has
a
sufficient
fleet
anywhere
it
is
theoretically
in
his
power
to
overthrow
our
control
of
any
special
sea
area
it
amounts
indeed
to
little
more
than
a
rhetorical
expression
used
to
emphasise
the
high
mobility
of
fleets
as
contrasted
with
that
of
armies
and
the
absence
of
physical
obstacles
to
restrict
that
mobility
that
this
vital
feature
of
naval
warfare
should
be
consecrated
in
a
maxim
is
well
but
when
it
is
caricatured
into
a
doctrine
as
it
sometimes
is
that
you
can
not
move
a
battalion
oversea
till
you
have
entirely
overthrown
your
enemy
fleet
it
deserves
gibbeting
it
would
be
as
wise
to
hold
that
in
war
you
must
never
risk
anything
it
would
seem
to
have
been
the
evil
influence
of
this
travestied
maxim
which
had
much
to
do
with
the
cramped
and
timorous
strategy
of
the
americans
in
their
late
war
with
spain
they
had
ample
naval
force
to
secure
such
a
local
and
temporary
command
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
as
to
have
justified
them
at
once
in
throwing
all
the
troops
they
had
ready
into
cuba
to
support
the
insurgents
in
accordance
with
their
war
plan
they
had
also
sufficient
strength
to
ensure
that
the
communications
with
the
expeditionary
force
could
not
be
interrupted
permanently
and
yet
because
the
spaniards
had
an
undefeated
fleet
at
sea
somewhere
they
hesitated
and
were
nearly
lost
the
japanese
had
no
such
illusions
without
having
struck
a
naval
blow
of
any
kind
and
with
a
hostile
fleet
actually
within
the
theatre
of
operations
they
started
their
essential
military
movement
oversea
content
that
though
they
might
not
be
able
to
secure
the
control
of
the
line
of
passage
they
were
in
a
position
to
deny
effective
control
to
the
enemy
our
own
history
is
full
of
such
operations
there
are
cases
in
plenty
where
the
results
promised
by
a
successful
military
blow
oversea
before
permanent
command
had
been
obtained
were
great
enough
to
justify
a
risk
which
like
the
japanese
we
knew
how
to
minimise
by
judicious
use
of
our
favourable
geographical
position
and
of
a
certain
system
of
protection
which
must
be
dealt
with
later
for
the
purpose
then
of
framing
a
plan
of
war
or
campaign
it
must
be
taken
that
command
may
exist
in
various
states
or
degrees
each
of
which
has
its
special
possibilities
and
limitations
it
may
be
general
or
local
and
it
may
be
permanent
or
temporary
general
command
may
be
permanent
or
temporary
but
mere
local
command
except
in
very
favourable
geographical
conditions
should
scarcely
ever
be
regarded
as
more
than
temporary
since
normally
it
is
always
liable
to
interruption
from
other
theatres
so
long
as
the
enemy
possesses
an
effective
naval
force
finally
it
has
to
be
noted
that
even
permanent
general
command
can
never
in
practice
be
absolute
no
degree
of
naval
superiority
can
ensure
our
communications
against
sporadic
attack
from
detached
cruisers
or
even
raiding
squadrons
if
they
be
boldly
led
and
are
prepared
to
risk
destruction
even
after
hawke
decisive
victory
at
quiberon
had
completed
the
overthrow
of
the
enemy
sea
forces
a
british
transport
was
captured
between
cork
and
portsmouth
and
an
indiaman
in
sight
of
the
lizard
while
wellington
complaints
in
the
peninsula
of
the
insecurity
of
his
communications
are
well
known
by
general
and
permanent
control
we
do
not
mean
that
the
enemy
can
do
nothing
but
that
he
can
not
interfere
with
our
maritime
trade
and
oversea
operations
so
seriously
as
to
affect
the
issue
of
the
war
and
that
he
can
not
carry
on
his
own
trade
and
operations
except
at
such
risk
and
hazard
as
to
remove
them
from
the
field
of
practical
strategy
in
other
words
it
means
that
the
enemy
can
no
longer
attack
our
lines
of
passage
and
communication
effectively
and
that
he
can
not
use
or
defend
his
own
in
justice
to
wellington
it
should
be
said
that
his
complaints
were
due
to
false
reports
that
exaggerated
a
couple
of
insignificant
captures
into
a
serious
interruption
to
complete
our
equipment
for
appreciating
any
situation
for
which
operations
have
to
be
designed
it
is
necessary
to
remember
that
when
the
command
is
in
dispute
the
general
conditions
may
give
a
stable
or
an
unstable
equilibrium
it
may
be
that
the
power
of
neither
side
preponderates
to
any
appreciable
extent
it
may
also
be
that
the
preponderance
is
with
ourselves
or
it
may
be
that
it
lies
with
the
enemy
such
preponderance
of
course
will
not
depend
entirely
on
actual
relative
strength
either
physical
or
moral
but
will
be
influenced
by
the
of
naval
positions
and
the
comparative
convenience
of
their
situation
in
regard
to
the
object
of
the
war
or
campaign
by
naval
positions
we
mean
firstly
naval
bases
and
secondly
the
terminals
of
the
greater
lines
of
communication
or
and
the
focal
areas
where
they
tend
to
converge
as
at
finisterre
gibraltar
suez
the
cape
singapore
and
many
others
upon
the
degree
and
distribution
of
this
preponderance
will
depend
in
a
general
way
the
extent
to
which
our
plans
will
be
governed
by
the
idea
of
defence
or
offence
generally
speaking
it
will
be
to
the
advantage
of
the
preponderating
side
to
seek
a
decision
as
quickly
as
possible
in
order
to
terminate
the
state
of
dispute
conversely
the
weaker
side
will
as
a
rule
seek
to
avoid
or
postpone
a
decision
in
hope
of
being
able
by
minor
operations
the
chances
of
war
or
the
development
of
fresh
strength
to
turn
the
balance
in
its
favour
such
was
the
line
which
france
adopted
frequently
in
her
wars
with
us
sometimes
legitimately
but
sometimes
to
such
an
excess
as
seriously
to
demoralise
her
fleet
her
experience
has
led
to
a
hasty
deduction
that
the
defensive
at
sea
for
even
a
weaker
power
is
an
unmixed
evil
such
a
conclusion
is
foreign
to
the
fundamental
principles
of
war
it
is
idle
to
exclude
the
use
of
an
expectant
attitude
because
in
itself
it
can
not
lead
to
final
success
and
because
if
used
to
excess
it
ends
in
demoralisation
and
the
loss
of
will
to
attack
the
misconception
appears
to
have
arisen
from
insistence
on
the
drawbacks
of
defence
by
writers
seeking
to
persuade
their
country
to
prepare
in
time
of
peace
sufficient
naval
strength
to
justify
offence
from
the
outset
having
now
determined
the
fundamental
principles
which
underlie
the
idea
of
command
of
the
sea
we
are
in
a
position
to
consider
the
manner
in
which
fleets
are
constituted
in
order
to
fit
them
for
their
task
chapter
two
theory
of
the
means
the
constitution
of
fleets
in
all
eras
of
naval
warfare
fighting
ships
have
exhibited
a
tendency
to
differentiate
into
groups
in
accordance
with
the
primary
function
each
class
was
designed
to
serve
these
groupings
or
classifications
are
what
is
meant
by
the
constitution
of
a
fleet
a
threefold
differentiation
into
battleships
cruisers
and
flotilla
has
so
long
dominated
naval
thought
that
we
have
come
to
regard
it
as
normal
and
even
essential
it
may
be
so
but
such
a
classification
has
been
by
no
means
constant
other
ideas
of
fleet
constitution
have
not
only
existed
but
have
stood
the
test
of
war
for
long
periods
and
it
is
unscientific
and
unsafe
to
ignore
such
facts
if
we
wish
to
arrive
at
sound
doctrine
the
truth
is
that
the
classes
of
ships
which
constitute
a
fleet
are
or
ought
to
be
the
expression
in
material
of
the
strategical
and
tactical
ideas
that
prevail
at
any
given
time
and
consequently
they
have
varied
not
only
with
the
ideas
but
also
with
the
material
in
vogue
it
may
also
be
said
more
broadly
that
they
have
varied
with
the
theory
of
war
by
which
more
or
less
consciously
naval
thought
was
dominated
it
is
true
that
few
ages
have
formulated
a
theory
of
war
or
even
been
clearly
aware
of
its
influence
but
nevertheless
such
theories
have
always
existed
and
even
in
their
most
nebulous
and
intangible
shapes
seem
to
have
exerted
an
ascertainable
influence
on
the
constitution
of
fleets
going
back
to
the
dawn
of
modern
times
we
note
that
at
the
opening
of
the
sixteenth
century
when
galley
warfare
reached
its
culmination
the
constitution
was
threefold
bearing
a
superficial
analogy
to
that
which
we
have
come
to
regard
as
normal
there
were
the
galeasses
and
heavy
galleys
corresponding
to
our
battleships
light
galleys
corresponding
to
our
cruisers
while
the
flotilla
was
represented
by
the
small
frigates
brigantines
and
similar
craft
which
had
no
slave
gang
for
propulsion
but
were
rowed
by
the
fighting
crew
such
armed
sailing
ships
as
then
existed
were
regarded
as
auxiliaries
and
formed
a
category
apart
as
fireships
and
did
in
the
sailing
period
and
as
do
now
but
the
parallel
must
not
be
overstrained
the
distinction
of
function
between
the
two
classes
of
galleys
was
not
so
strongly
marked
as
that
between
the
lighter
craft
and
the
galleys
that
is
to
say
the
scientific
differentiation
between
battleships
and
cruisers
had
not
yet
been
so
firmly
developed
as
it
was
destined
to
become
in
later
times
and
the
smaller
galleys
habitually
took
their
place
in
the
fighting
line
with
the
rise
of
the
sailing
vessel
as
the
typical
an
entirely
new
constitution
made
its
appearance
the
dominating
classification
became
twofold
it
was
a
classification
into
vessels
of
subservient
movement
using
sails
and
vessels
of
free
movement
using
oars
it
was
on
these
lines
that
our
true
royal
navy
was
first
organised
by
henry
the
eighth
an
expert
who
in
the
science
of
war
was
one
of
the
most
advanced
masters
in
europe
in
this
constitution
there
appears
even
less
conception
than
in
that
of
the
galley
period
of
a
radical
distinction
between
battleships
and
cruisers
as
henry
fleet
was
originally
designed
practically
the
whole
of
the
battleships
were
sailing
vessels
though
it
is
true
that
when
the
french
brought
up
galleys
from
the
mediterranean
he
gave
some
of
the
smartest
of
them
oars
the
constitution
was
in
fact
one
of
battleships
and
flotilla
of
cruisers
there
were
none
as
we
understand
them
fleet
scouting
was
done
by
the
and
newly
introduced
pinnaces
of
the
flotilla
while
as
for
commerce
protection
merchant
vessels
had
usually
to
look
after
themselves
the
larger
ones
being
regularly
armed
for
their
own
defence
the
influence
of
this
twofold
constitution
continued
long
after
the
conditions
of
its
origin
had
passed
away
in
degree
indeed
it
may
be
said
to
have
lasted
for
two
hundred
years
during
the
dutch
wars
of
the
seventeenth
century
which
finally
established
the
dominant
status
of
the
sailing
warship
practically
all
true
sailing
vessels
that
is
vessels
that
had
no
auxiliary
oar
propulsion
took
station
in
the
line
the
frigates
of
that
time
differed
not
at
all
from
the
great
ship
in
their
functions
but
only
in
their
design
by
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
however
the
old
tendency
to
a
threefold
organisation
began
to
reassert
itself
but
it
was
not
till
the
middle
of
the
century
that
the
process
of
development
can
be
regarded
as
complete
down
to
the
end
of
the
war
of
the
austrian
succession
a
period
which
is
usually
deemed
to
be
one
of
conspicuous
depression
in
the
naval
art
the
classification
of
our
larger
sailing
vessels
was
purely
arbitrary
the
rates
which
had
been
introduced
during
the
dutch
wars
bore
no
relation
to
any
philosophical
conception
of
the
complex
duties
of
a
fleet
in
the
first
rate
were
ships
in
the
second
ships
all
so
far
the
system
of
rating
was
sound
enough
but
when
we
come
to
the
third
rate
we
find
it
includes
ships
which
were
also
of
three
decks
while
the
bulk
of
the
rest
were
the
fourth
rate
was
also
composed
of
ships
weak
of
and
guns
and
this
was
far
the
largest
class
all
these
four
rates
were
classed
as
below
them
came
the
fifth
rates
which
though
they
were
used
as
cruisers
had
no
distinct
class
name
they
differed
indeed
only
in
degree
from
the
being
all
cramped
of
and
guns
and
they
must
be
regarded
in
so
far
as
they
expressed
any
logical
idea
of
naval
warfare
as
the
forerunners
of
the
intermediate
class
represented
in
the
succeeding
epochs
by
ships
and
in
our
own
time
by
armoured
cruisers
the
only
true
cruiser
is
found
in
the
sixth
rate
which
comprised
small
and
weakly
armed
ships
and
between
them
and
the
forties
there
was
nothing
below
them
but
again
without
any
clear
differentiation
came
the
unrated
sloops
representing
the
flotilla
in
such
a
system
of
rating
there
is
no
logical
distinction
either
between
large
and
small
battleships
or
between
battleships
and
cruisers
or
between
cruisers
and
flotilla
the
only
marked
break
in
the
gradual
descent
is
that
between
the
and
the
cruisers
as
these
latter
vessels
as
well
as
the
sloops
used
sweeps
for
auxiliary
propulsion
we
are
forced
to
conclude
that
the
only
basis
of
the
classification
was
that
adopted
by
henry
the
eighth
which
sound
as
it
was
in
his
time
had
long
ceased
to
have
any
real
relation
to
the
actuality
of
naval
war
it
was
not
till
anson
memorable
administration
that
a
scientific
system
of
rating
was
and
the
fleet
at
last
assumed
the
logical
constitution
which
it
retained
up
to
our
own
time
in
the
first
two
rates
appear
the
fleet
flagship
class
of
and
guns
respectively
all
smaller
are
eliminated
in
the
next
two
rates
we
have
the
rank
and
file
of
the
of
increased
in
the
third
rate
and
in
the
fourth
here
however
is
a
slight
break
in
the
perfection
of
the
system
for
the
fourth
rate
also
included
ships
of
two
decks
which
during
the
progress
of
the
seven
years
war
ceased
to
be
regarded
as
war
experience
was
eliminating
small
battleships
and
therewith
it
called
for
a
type
intermediate
between
battleships
and
cruisers
with
whose
functions
we
shall
have
to
deal
directly
in
practice
these
units
soon
formed
a
rate
by
themselves
into
which
by
the
same
tendency
ships
were
destined
to
sink
half
a
century
later
but
most
pregnant
of
all
anson
reforms
was
the
introduction
of
the
true
cruiser
no
longer
a
small
battleship
but
a
vessel
specialised
for
its
logical
functions
and
distinct
in
design
both
from
the
battle
rates
and
the
flotilla
both
and
types
were
abolished
and
in
their
place
appear
two
cruiser
rates
and
the
fifth
consisting
of
true
frigates
and
the
sixth
of
frigates
both
completely
divorced
from
any
battle
function
finally
after
a
very
distinct
gap
came
the
unrated
sloops
and
smaller
craft
which
formed
the
flotilla
for
coastwise
and
inshore
work
despatch
service
and
kindred
duties
the
reforms
of
the
great
first
lord
amounted
in
fact
to
a
clearly
apprehended
threefold
constitution
in
which
the
various
groups
were
frankly
specialised
in
accordance
with
the
functions
each
was
expected
to
perform
specialisation
it
will
be
observed
is
the
note
of
the
process
of
development
we
have
no
longer
an
endeavour
to
adapt
the
fleet
to
its
multifarious
duties
by
multiplying
a
comparatively
weak
nature
of
which
could
act
in
the
line
and
yet
be
had
in
sufficient
numbers
to
protect
commerce
but
which
was
not
well
fitted
for
either
service
instead
we
note
a
definite
recognition
of
the
principle
that
battleships
should
be
as
powerful
as
possible
and
that
in
order
to
permit
of
their
due
development
they
must
be
relieved
of
their
cruising
functions
by
a
class
of
vessel
specially
adapted
for
the
purpose
the
question
we
have
to
consider
is
was
this
specialisation
which
has
asserted
itself
down
to
our
own
times
in
the
true
line
of
development
was
it
in
fact
a
right
expression
of
the
needs
which
are
indicated
by
the
theory
of
naval
war
by
the
theory
of
naval
war
it
must
be
reiterated
we
mean
nothing
but
an
enunciation
of
the
fundamental
principles
which
underlie
all
naval
war
those
principles
if
we
have
determined
them
correctly
should
be
found
giving
shape
not
only
to
strategy
and
tactics
but
also
to
material
whatever
method
and
means
of
naval
warfare
may
be
in
use
at
any
given
time
conversely
if
we
find
strategy
tactics
or
organisation
exhibiting
a
tendency
to
reproduce
the
same
forms
under
widely
differing
conditions
of
method
and
material
we
should
be
able
to
show
that
those
forms
bear
a
constant
and
definite
relation
to
the
principles
which
our
theory
endeavours
to
express
in
the
case
of
anson
threefold
organisation
the
relation
is
not
far
to
seek
though
it
has
become
obscured
by
two
maxims
the
one
is
that
the
command
of
the
sea
depends
upon
battleships
and
the
other
that
cruisers
are
the
eyes
of
the
fleet
it
is
the
inherent
evil
of
maxims
that
they
tend
to
get
stretched
beyond
their
original
meaning
both
of
these
express
a
truth
but
neither
expresses
the
whole
truth
on
no
theory
of
naval
warfare
can
we
expect
to
command
the
sea
with
battleships
nor
on
the
communication
theory
can
we
regard
the
primary
function
of
cruisers
as
being
to
scout
for
a
it
is
perfectly
true
that
the
control
depends
ultimately
on
the
if
control
is
disputed
by
a
hostile
as
it
usually
is
it
is
also
true
that
so
far
as
is
necessary
to
enable
the
to
secure
the
control
we
have
to
furnish
it
with
eyes
from
our
cruiser
force
but
it
does
not
follow
that
this
is
the
primary
function
of
cruisers
the
truth
is
we
have
to
withdraw
them
from
their
primary
function
in
order
to
do
work
for
the
which
it
can
not
do
for
itself
well
established
as
is
the
eyes
of
the
fleet
maxim
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
show
that
scouting
was
ever
regarded
as
the
primary
function
of
cruisers
by
the
highest
authorities
in
nelson
practice
at
least
their
paramount
function
was
to
exercise
the
control
which
he
was
securing
with
his
nothing
is
more
familiar
in
naval
history
than
his
incessant
cry
from
the
mediterranean
for
more
cruisers
but
the
significance
of
that
cry
has
become
obscured
it
was
not
that
his
cruisers
were
not
numerous
in
proportion
to
his
battleships
they
were
usually
nearly
double
in
number
but
it
was
rather
that
he
was
so
deeply
convinced
of
their
true
function
that
he
used
them
to
exercise
control
to
an
extent
which
sometimes
reduced
his
fleet
cruisers
below
the
limit
of
bare
necessity
the
result
on
a
memorable
occasion
was
the
escape
of
the
but
the
further
result
is
equally
important
it
was
that
the
escape
of
that
fleet
did
not
deprive
him
of
the
control
which
he
was
charged
to
maintain
his
judgment
may
have
been
at
fault
but
the
strategical
distribution
of
his
force
was
consistent
throughout
the
whole
period
of
his
mediterranean
command
judged
by
his
record
no
man
ever
grasped
more
clearly
than
nelson
that
the
object
of
naval
warfare
was
to
control
communications
and
if
he
found
that
he
had
not
a
sufficient
number
of
cruisers
to
exercise
that
control
and
to
furnish
eyes
for
his
as
well
it
was
the
that
was
made
to
suffer
and
surely
this
is
at
least
the
logical
view
had
the
french
been
ready
to
risk
settling
the
question
of
the
control
in
a
fleet
action
it
would
have
been
different
he
would
then
have
been
right
to
sacrifice
the
exercise
of
control
for
the
time
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
action
should
take
place
and
end
decisively
in
his
favour
but
he
knew
they
were
not
ready
to
take
such
a
risk
and
he
refused
to
permit
a
purely
defensive
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
to
delude
him
from
the
special
function
with
which
he
had
been
charged
if
the
object
of
naval
warfare
is
to
control
communications
then
the
fundamental
requirement
is
the
means
of
exercising
that
control
logically
therefore
if
the
enemy
holds
back
from
battle
decision
we
must
relegate
the
to
a
secondary
position
for
cruisers
are
the
means
of
exercising
control
the
is
but
the
means
of
preventing
their
being
interfered
with
in
their
work
put
it
to
the
test
of
actual
practice
in
no
case
can
we
exercise
control
by
battleships
alone
their
specialisation
has
rendered
them
unfit
for
the
work
and
has
made
them
too
costly
ever
to
be
numerous
enough
even
therefore
if
our
enemy
had
no
we
could
not
make
control
effective
with
battleships
alone
we
should
still
require
cruisers
specialised
for
the
work
and
in
sufficient
numbers
to
cover
the
necessary
ground
but
the
converse
is
not
true
we
could
exercise
control
with
cruisers
alone
if
the
enemy
had
no
to
interfere
with
them
if
then
we
seek
a
formula
that
will
express
the
practical
results
of
our
theory
it
would
take
some
such
shape
as
this
on
cruisers
depends
our
exercise
of
control
on
the
depends
the
security
of
control
that
is
the
logical
sequence
of
ideas
and
it
shows
us
that
the
current
maxim
is
really
the
conclusion
of
a
logical
argument
in
which
the
initial
steps
must
not
be
ignored
the
maxim
that
the
command
of
the
sea
depends
on
the
is
then
perfectly
sound
so
long
as
it
is
taken
to
include
all
the
other
facts
on
which
it
hangs
the
true
function
of
the
is
to
protect
cruisers
and
flotilla
at
their
special
work
the
best
means
of
doing
this
is
of
course
to
destroy
the
enemy
power
of
interference
the
doctrine
of
destroying
the
enemy
armed
forces
as
the
paramount
object
here
reasserts
itself
and
reasserts
itself
so
strongly
as
to
permit
for
most
practical
purposes
the
rough
generalisation
that
the
command
depends
upon
the
of
what
practical
use
then
it
may
be
asked
is
all
this
hairsplitting
why
not
leave
untainted
the
conviction
that
our
first
and
foremost
business
is
to
crush
the
enemy
and
that
to
this
end
our
whole
effort
should
be
concentrated
the
answer
is
to
point
to
nelson
dilemma
it
was
a
dilemma
which
in
the
golden
age
of
naval
warfare
every
admiral
at
sea
had
had
to
solve
for
himself
and
it
was
always
one
of
the
most
difficult
details
of
every
naval
war
plan
if
we
seek
to
ensure
the
effective
action
of
the
by
giving
it
a
large
proportion
of
cruisers
by
so
much
do
we
weaken
the
actual
and
continuous
exercise
of
control
if
we
seek
to
make
that
control
effective
by
devoting
to
the
service
a
large
proportion
of
cruisers
by
so
much
do
we
prejudice
our
chance
of
getting
contact
with
and
defeating
the
enemy
which
is
the
only
means
of
perfecting
control
the
correct
solution
of
the
dilemma
will
of
course
depend
upon
the
conditions
of
each
case
mainly
upon
the
relative
strength
and
activity
of
the
hostile
and
our
enemy
probable
intentions
but
no
matter
how
completely
we
have
tabulated
all
the
relevant
facts
we
can
never
hope
to
come
to
a
sound
conclusion
upon
them
without
a
just
appreciation
of
all
the
elements
which
go
to
give
command
and
without
the
power
of
gauging
their
relative
importance
this
and
this
alone
will
ultimately
settle
the
vital
question
of
what
proportion
of
our
cruiser
force
it
is
right
to
devote
to
the
if
the
doctrine
of
cruiser
control
be
correct
then
every
cruiser
attached
to
the
is
one
withdrawn
from
its
true
function
such
withdrawals
are
inevitable
a
squadron
of
battleships
is
an
imperfect
organism
unable
to
do
its
work
without
cruiser
assistance
and
since
the
performance
of
its
work
is
essential
to
cruiser
freedom
some
cruisers
must
be
sacrificed
but
in
what
proportion
if
we
confine
ourselves
to
the
view
that
command
depends
on
the
then
we
shall
attach
to
it
such
a
number
as
its
commander
may
deem
necessary
to
make
contact
with
the
enemy
absolutely
certain
and
to
surround
himself
with
an
impenetrable
screen
if
we
knew
the
enemy
was
as
anxious
for
a
decision
as
ourselves
such
a
course
might
be
justified
but
the
normal
condition
is
that
if
we
desire
a
decision
it
is
because
we
have
definite
hopes
of
success
and
consequently
the
enemy
will
probably
seek
to
avoid
one
on
our
terms
in
practice
this
means
that
if
we
have
perfected
our
arrangements
for
the
destruction
of
his
main
fleet
he
will
refuse
to
expose
it
till
he
sees
a
more
favourable
opportunity
and
what
will
be
the
result
he
remains
on
the
defensive
and
theoretically
all
the
ensuing
period
of
inaction
tends
to
fall
into
his
scale
without
stirring
from
port
his
fleet
is
doing
its
work
the
more
closely
he
induces
us
to
concentrate
our
cruiser
force
in
face
of
his
the
more
he
frees
the
sea
for
the
circulation
of
his
own
trade
and
the
more
he
exposes
ours
to
cruiser
raids
experience
then
and
theory
alike
dictate
that
as
a
general
principle
cruisers
should
be
regarded
as
primarily
concerned
with
the
active
occupation
of
communications
and
that
withdrawals
for
fleet
purposes
should
be
reduced
to
the
furthest
margin
of
reasonable
risk
what
that
margin
should
be
can
only
be
decided
on
the
circumstances
of
each
case
as
it
arises
and
by
the
personal
characteristics
of
the
officers
who
are
responsible
nelson
practice
was
to
reduce
fleet
cruisers
lower
than
perhaps
any
other
commander
so
small
indeed
was
the
margin
of
efficiency
he
left
that
in
the
campaign
already
cited
when
his
judgment
was
ripest
one
stroke
of
a
chance
betrayal
of
his
position
by
a
neutral
availed
to
deprive
him
of
the
decision
he
sought
and
to
let
the
enemy
fleet
escape
we
arrive
then
at
this
general
conclusion
the
object
of
naval
warfare
is
to
control
maritime
communications
in
order
to
exercise
that
control
effectively
we
must
have
a
numerous
class
of
vessels
specially
adapted
for
pursuit
but
their
power
of
exercising
control
is
in
proportion
to
our
degree
of
command
that
is
to
our
power
of
preventing
their
operations
being
interfered
with
by
the
enemy
their
own
power
of
resistance
is
in
inverse
proportion
to
their
power
of
exercising
control
that
is
to
say
the
more
numerous
and
better
adapted
they
are
for
preying
on
commerce
and
transports
the
weaker
will
be
their
individual
fighting
power
we
can
not
give
them
as
a
whole
the
power
of
resisting
disturbance
without
at
the
same
time
reducing
their
power
of
exercising
control
the
accepted
solution
of
the
difficulty
during
the
great
period
of
anson
school
was
to
provide
them
with
a
covering
force
of
battle
units
specially
adapted
for
fighting
but
here
arises
a
correlative
difficulty
in
so
far
as
we
give
our
battle
units
fighting
power
we
deny
them
scouting
power
and
scouting
is
essential
to
their
effective
operation
the
must
have
eyes
now
vessels
adapted
for
control
of
communications
are
also
well
adapted
for
eyes
it
becomes
the
practice
therefore
to
withdraw
from
control
operations
a
sufficient
number
of
units
to
enable
the
to
cover
effectively
the
operations
of
those
that
remain
such
were
the
broad
principles
on
which
the
inevitable
dilemma
always
had
to
be
solved
and
on
which
anson
organisation
was
based
they
flow
naturally
from
the
communication
theory
of
maritime
war
and
it
was
this
theory
which
then
dominated
naval
thought
as
is
apparent
from
the
technical
use
of
such
phrases
as
lines
of
passage
and
communication
the
war
plans
of
the
great
strategists
from
anson
and
barham
can
always
be
resolved
into
these
simple
elements
and
where
we
find
the
admiralty
grip
of
them
loosened
we
have
the
confusion
and
quite
unnecessary
failures
of
the
war
of
american
independence
in
that
mismanaged
contest
the
cardinal
mistake
was
that
we
suffered
the
enemy
to
get
upon
and
occupy
the
vital
lines
of
passage
and
communication
without
first
bringing
them
to
action
an
error
partly
due
to
the
unreadiness
of
a
weak
administration
and
partly
to
an
insufficient
allocation
of
cruisers
to
secure
contact
at
the
right
places
so
far
then
the
principles
on
which
our
naval
supremacy
was
built
up
are
clear
for
the
enemies
with
whom
we
had
to
deal
anson
system
was
admirably
conceived
both
spain
and
france
held
the
communication
theory
so
strongly
that
they
were
content
to
count
as
success
the
power
of
continually
disturbing
our
control
without
any
real
attempt
to
secure
it
for
themselves
to
defeat
such
a
policy
anson
constitution
and
the
strategy
it
connoted
were
thoroughly
well
adapted
and
easy
to
work
but
it
by
no
means
follows
that
his
doctrine
is
the
last
word
even
in
his
own
time
complications
had
begun
to
develop
which
tended
to
confuse
the
precision
of
his
system
by
the
culminating
year
of
trafalgar
there
were
indications
that
it
was
getting
worn
out
while
the
new
methods
and
material
used
by
the
americans
in
made
a
serious
rent
in
it
the
disturbances
then
inaugurated
have
continued
to
develop
and
it
is
necessary
to
consider
how
seriously
they
have
confused
the
problem
of
fleet
constitution
firstly
there
is
the
general
recognition
always
patent
to
ourselves
that
by
far
the
most
drastic
economical
and
effective
way
of
securing
control
is
to
destroy
the
enemy
means
of
interfering
with
it
in
our
own
service
this
overthrow
idea
always
tended
to
assert
itself
so
strongly
that
occasionally
the
means
became
for
a
time
more
important
than
the
end
that
is
to
say
circumstances
were
such
that
on
occasions
it
was
considered
advisable
to
sacrifice
the
exercise
of
control
for
a
time
in
order
quickly
and
permanently
to
deprive
the
enemy
of
all
means
of
interference
when
there
was
reasonable
hope
of
the
enemy
risking
a
decision
this
consideration
tended
to
override
all
others
but
when
as
in
nelson
case
in
the
mediterranean
the
hope
was
small
the
exercise
of
control
tended
to
take
the
paramount
place
the
second
complexity
arose
from
the
fact
that
however
strong
might
be
our
battleship
cover
it
is
impossible
for
it
absolutely
to
secure
cruiser
control
from
disturbance
by
sporadic
attack
isolated
heavy
ships
taking
advantage
of
the
chances
of
the
sea
could
elude
even
the
strictest
blockade
and
one
such
ship
if
she
succeeded
in
getting
upon
a
line
of
communication
might
paralyse
the
operations
of
a
number
of
weaker
units
they
must
either
run
or
concentrate
and
in
either
case
the
control
was
broken
if
it
were
a
squadron
of
heavy
ships
that
caused
the
disturbance
the
practice
was
to
detach
against
it
a
division
of
the
covering
but
it
was
obviously
highly
inconvenient
and
contrary
to
the
whole
idea
on
which
the
constitution
of
the
fleet
was
based
to
allow
every
slight
danger
to
cruiser
control
to
loosen
the
cohesion
of
the
main
fleet
it
was
necessary
then
to
give
cruiser
lines
some
power
of
resistance
this
necessity
once
admitted
there
seemed
no
point
at
which
you
could
stop
increasing
the
fighting
power
of
your
cruisers
and
sooner
or
later
unless
some
means
of
checking
the
process
were
found
the
distinction
between
cruisers
and
battleships
would
practically
disappear
such
a
means
was
found
in
what
may
be
called
the
intermediate
ship
frigates
did
indeed
continue
to
increase
in
size
and
fighting
power
throughout
the
remainder
of
the
sailing
era
but
it
was
not
only
in
this
manner
that
the
power
of
resistance
was
gained
the
evil
results
of
the
movement
were
checked
by
the
introduction
of
a
supporting
ship
midway
between
frigates
and
true
sometimes
classed
as
a
battleship
and
taking
her
place
in
the
line
the
ship
came
to
be
essentially
a
type
for
stiffening
cruiser
squadrons
they
most
commonly
appear
as
the
flagships
of
cruiser
commodores
or
stationed
in
terminal
waters
or
at
focal
points
where
sporadic
raids
were
likely
to
fall
and
be
most
destructive
the
strategical
effect
of
the
presence
of
such
a
vessel
in
a
cruiser
line
was
to
give
the
whole
line
in
some
degree
the
strength
of
the
intermediate
ship
for
any
hostile
cruiser
endeavouring
to
disturb
the
line
was
liable
to
have
to
deal
with
the
supporting
ship
while
if
a
frigate
and
a
ship
got
together
they
were
a
match
even
for
a
small
in
sailing
days
of
course
this
power
of
the
supporting
ship
was
weak
owing
to
the
imperfection
of
the
means
of
distant
communication
between
ships
at
sea
and
the
of
such
means
beyond
extreme
range
of
vision
but
as
wireless
telegraphy
develops
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
expect
that
the
strategic
value
of
the
supporting
or
intermediate
ship
will
be
found
greater
than
it
ever
was
in
sailing
days
and
that
for
dealing
with
sporadic
disturbance
the
tendency
will
be
for
a
cruiser
line
to
approximate
more
and
more
in
power
of
resistance
to
that
of
its
strongest
unit
for
fleet
service
a
cruiser
power
of
resistance
was
hardly
less
valuable
for
though
we
speak
of
fleet
cruisers
as
the
eyes
of
the
fleet
their
purpose
is
almost
equally
to
blindfold
the
enemy
their
duty
is
not
only
to
disclose
the
movements
of
the
enemy
but
also
to
act
as
a
screen
to
conceal
our
own
the
point
was
specially
well
marked
in
the
blockades
where
the
old
ships
are
almost
always
found
with
the
inshore
cruiser
squadron
preventing
that
squadron
being
forced
by
inquisitive
frigates
important
as
this
power
of
resistance
in
the
screen
was
in
the
old
days
it
is
tenfold
more
important
now
and
the
consequent
difficulty
of
keeping
cruisers
distinct
from
battleships
is
greater
than
ever
the
reason
for
this
is
best
considered
under
the
third
and
most
serious
cause
of
complexity
the
third
cause
is
the
acquisition
by
the
flotilla
of
battle
power
it
is
a
feature
of
naval
warfare
that
is
entirely
new
for
all
practical
purposes
it
was
unknown
until
the
full
development
of
the
mobile
torpedo
it
is
true
that
the
fireship
as
originally
conceived
was
regarded
as
having
something
of
the
same
power
during
the
dutch
wars
the
heyday
of
its
vogue
its
assigned
power
was
on
some
occasions
actually
realised
as
in
the
burning
of
lord
sandwich
flagship
at
the
battle
of
solebay
and
the
destruction
of
the
fleet
at
palermo
by
duquesne
but
as
the
nimbleness
of
increased
with
the
ripening
of
seamanship
and
naval
architecture
the
fireship
as
a
battle
weapon
became
almost
negligible
while
a
fleet
at
anchor
was
found
to
be
thoroughly
defensible
by
its
own
towards
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
indeed
the
occasions
on
which
the
fireship
could
be
used
for
its
special
purpose
was
regarded
as
highly
exceptional
and
though
the
type
was
retained
till
the
end
of
the
century
its
normal
functions
differed
not
at
all
from
those
of
the
rest
of
the
flotilla
of
which
it
then
formed
part
but
not
without
analogous
precedent
in
the
later
middle
ages
small
craft
were
assigned
the
function
in
battle
of
trying
to
wedge
up
the
rudders
of
great
ships
or
bore
holes
between
wind
and
water
see
fighting
instructions
navy
record
society
those
functions
as
we
have
seen
expressed
the
cruising
idea
in
its
purest
sense
it
was
numbers
and
mobility
that
determined
flotilla
types
rather
than
armament
or
capacity
for
their
primary
purpose
was
to
control
communications
in
home
and
colonial
waters
against
weakly
armed
privateers
the
type
which
these
duties
determined
fitted
them
adequately
for
the
secondary
purpose
of
inshore
and
despatch
work
with
a
fleet
it
was
moreover
on
the
ubiquity
which
their
numbers
gave
them
and
on
their
power
of
dealing
with
unarmed
or
lightly
armed
vessels
that
we
relied
for
our
first
line
of
defence
against
invasion
these
latter
duties
were
of
course
exceptional
and
the
navy
list
did
not
carry
as
a
rule
sufficient
numbers
for
the
purpose
but
a
special
value
of
the
class
was
that
it
was
capable
of
rapid
and
almost
indefinite
expansion
from
the
mercantile
marine
anything
that
could
carry
a
gun
had
its
use
and
during
the
period
of
the
napoleonic
threat
the
defence
flotilla
rose
all
told
to
considerably
over
a
thousand
units
formidable
and
effective
as
was
a
flotilla
of
this
type
for
the
ends
it
was
designed
to
serve
it
obviously
in
no
way
affected
the
security
of
a
but
so
soon
as
the
flotilla
acquired
battle
power
the
whole
situation
was
changed
and
the
old
principles
of
cruiser
design
and
distribution
were
torn
to
shreds
the
became
a
more
imperfect
organism
than
ever
formerly
it
was
only
its
offensive
power
that
required
supplementing
the
new
condition
meant
that
unaided
it
could
no
longer
ensure
its
own
defence
it
now
required
screening
not
only
from
observation
but
also
from
flotilla
attack
the
theoretical
weakness
of
an
arrested
offensive
received
a
practical
and
concrete
illustration
to
a
degree
that
war
had
scarcely
ever
known
our
most
dearly
cherished
strategical
traditions
were
shaken
to
the
bottom
the
proper
place
for
our
had
always
been
on
the
enemy
coasts
and
now
that
was
precisely
where
the
enemy
would
be
best
pleased
to
see
it
what
was
to
be
done
so
splendid
a
tradition
could
not
lightly
be
laid
aside
but
the
attempt
to
preserve
it
involved
us
still
deeper
in
heresy
the
vital
most
difficult
and
most
absorbing
problem
has
become
not
how
to
increase
the
power
of
a
for
attack
which
is
a
comparatively
simple
matter
but
how
to
defend
it
as
the
offensive
power
of
the
flotilla
developed
the
problem
pressed
with
an
almost
bewildering
intensity
with
every
increase
in
the
speed
and
power
of
torpedo
craft
the
problem
of
the
screen
grew
more
exacting
to
keep
the
hostile
flotilla
out
of
night
range
the
screen
must
be
flung
out
wider
and
wider
and
this
meant
more
and
more
cruisers
withdrawn
from
their
primary
function
and
not
only
this
the
screen
must
not
only
be
far
flung
but
it
must
be
made
as
far
as
possible
impenetrable
in
other
words
its
own
power
of
resistance
must
be
increased
all
along
the
line
whole
squadrons
of
armoured
cruisers
had
to
be
attached
to
to
support
the
weaker
members
of
the
screen
the
crying
need
for
this
type
of
ship
set
up
a
rapid
movement
for
increasing
their
fighting
power
and
with
it
fell
with
equal
rapidity
the
economic
possibility
of
giving
the
cruiser
class
its
essential
attribute
of
numbers
as
an
inevitable
result
we
find
ourselves
involved
in
an
effort
to
restore
to
the
flotilla
some
of
its
old
cruiser
capacity
by
endowing
it
with
gun
armament
higher
power
and
facilities
for
distant
communication
all
at
the
cost
of
specialisation
and
of
greater
economic
strain
still
judged
by
past
experience
some
means
of
increasing
numbers
in
the
cruising
types
is
essential
nor
is
it
clear
how
it
is
possible
to
secure
that
essential
in
the
ranks
of
the
true
cruiser
no
point
has
been
found
at
which
it
was
possible
to
stop
the
tendency
of
this
class
of
vessel
to
increase
in
size
and
cost
or
to
recall
it
to
the
strategical
position
it
used
to
occupy
so
insecure
is
the
so
imperfect
as
a
weapon
has
it
become
that
its
need
has
overridden
the
old
order
of
things
and
the
primary
function
of
the
cruising
ship
inclines
to
be
no
longer
the
exercise
of
control
under
cover
of
the
the
now
demands
protection
by
the
cruising
ship
and
what
the
needs
is
held
to
be
the
first
necessity
judged
by
the
old
naval
practice
it
is
an
anomalous
position
to
have
reached
but
the
whole
naval
art
has
suffered
a
revolution
beyond
all
previous
experience
and
it
is
possible
the
old
practice
is
no
longer
a
safe
guide
driven
by
the
same
necessities
every
naval
power
is
following
the
same
course
it
may
be
right
it
may
be
wrong
no
one
at
least
but
the
ignorant
or
hasty
will
venture
to
pass
categorical
judgment
the
best
we
can
do
is
to
endeavour
to
realise
the
situation
to
which
in
spite
of
all
misgivings
we
have
been
forced
and
to
determine
its
relations
to
the
developments
of
the
past
it
is
undoubtedly
a
difficult
task
as
we
have
seen
there
have
prevailed
in
the
constitution
of
fleets
at
various
times
several
methods
of
expressing
the
necessities
of
naval
war
the
present
system
differs
from
them
all
on
the
one
hand
we
have
the
fact
that
the
latest
developments
of
cruiser
power
have
finally
obliterated
all
logical
distinction
between
cruisers
and
battleships
and
we
thus
find
ourselves
hand
in
hand
with
the
fleet
constitution
of
the
old
dutch
wars
on
the
other
however
we
have
armoured
cruisers
organised
in
squadrons
and
attached
to
not
only
for
strategical
purposes
but
also
with
as
yet
undeveloped
tactical
functions
in
battle
here
we
come
close
to
the
latest
development
of
the
sailing
era
when
advanced
or
light
squadrons
began
to
appear
in
the
organisation
of
the
system
arose
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
the
mediterranean
where
the
conditions
of
control
called
for
so
wide
a
dispersal
of
cruisers
and
so
great
a
number
of
them
that
it
was
almost
imperative
for
a
in
that
sea
to
do
much
of
its
own
scouting
it
was
certainly
for
this
purpose
that
the
fastest
and
lightest
were
formed
into
a
separate
unit
and
the
first
designation
it
received
was
that
of
observation
squadron
it
remained
for
nelson
to
endeavour
to
endow
it
with
a
tactical
function
but
his
idea
was
never
realised
either
by
himself
or
any
of
his
successors
side
by
side
with
this
new
element
in
the
organisation
of
a
which
perhaps
is
best
designated
as
a
light
division
we
have
another
significant
fact
not
only
was
it
not
always
composed
entirely
of
especially
in
the
french
service
but
in
the
year
of
the
full
development
we
have
sir
richard
strachan
using
the
heavy
frigates
attached
to
his
as
a
light
division
and
giving
them
a
definite
tactical
function
the
collapse
of
the
french
navy
put
a
stop
to
further
developments
of
either
idea
whither
they
would
have
led
we
can
not
tell
but
it
is
impossible
to
shut
our
eyes
to
the
indication
of
a
growing
tendency
towards
the
system
that
exists
at
present
it
is
difficult
at
least
to
ignore
the
fact
that
both
nelson
and
strachan
in
that
culminating
year
found
the
actuality
of
war
calling
for
something
for
which
there
was
then
no
provision
in
the
constitution
of
the
fleet
but
which
it
does
contain
what
nelson
felt
for
was
a
battleship
of
cruiser
speed
what
strachan
desired
was
a
cruiser
fit
to
take
a
tactical
part
in
a
fleet
action
we
have
them
both
but
with
what
result
specialisation
of
types
has
almost
disappeared
and
our
present
fleet
constitution
is
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
from
that
of
the
seventeenth
century
we
retain
the
nomenclature
but
the
system
itself
has
really
gone
battleships
grade
into
armoured
cruisers
armoured
cruisers
into
protected
cruisers
we
can
scarcely
detect
any
real
distinction
except
a
twofold
one
between
vessels
whose
primary
armament
is
the
gun
and
vessels
whose
primary
armament
is
the
torpedo
but
even
here
the
existence
of
a
type
of
cruiser
designed
to
act
with
flotillas
blurs
the
outline
while
as
we
have
seen
the
larger
units
of
the
flotilla
are
grading
up
to
cruiser
level
we
are
thus
face
to
face
with
a
situation
which
has
its
closest
counterpart
in
the
structureless
fleets
of
the
seventeenth
century
that
naval
thought
should
have
so
nearly
retraced
its
steps
in
the
course
of
two
centuries
is
curious
enough
but
it
is
still
more
striking
when
we
consider
how
widely
the
underlying
causes
differ
in
each
case
the
pressure
which
has
forced
the
present
situation
is
due
most
obviously
to
two
causes
one
is
the
excessive
development
of
the
intermediate
ship
originally
devised
for
purposes
of
commerce
protection
and
dictated
by
a
menace
which
the
experience
of
the
american
war
had
taught
us
to
respect
the
other
is
the
introduction
of
the
torpedo
and
the
consequent
vulnerability
of
that
are
not
securely
screened
nothing
of
the
kind
had
any
influence
on
the
fleet
constitution
of
the
seventeenth
century
but
if
we
seek
deeper
there
is
a
less
obvious
consideration
which
for
what
it
is
worth
is
too
striking
to
be
ignored
it
has
been
suggested
above
that
the
constitution
of
fleets
appears
to
have
some
more
or
less
recognisable
relation
to
the
prevalent
theory
of
war
now
amongst
all
our
uncertainty
we
can
assert
with
confidence
that
the
theory
which
holds
the
field
at
the
present
day
bears
the
closest
possible
resemblance
to
that
which
dominated
the
of
the
dutch
war
it
was
the
overthrow
theory
the
firm
faith
in
the
decisive
action
as
the
key
of
all
strategical
problems
they
carried
it
to
sea
with
them
from
the
battlefields
of
the
new
model
army
and
the
dutch
met
them
squarely
in
the
first
war
at
least
their
commerce
had
to
give
place
to
the
exigencies
of
throwing
into
the
battle
everything
that
could
affect
the
issue
it
is
not
of
course
pretended
that
this
attitude
was
dictated
by
any
clearly
conceived
theory
of
absolute
war
it
was
due
rather
to
the
fact
that
owing
to
the
relative
geographical
conditions
all
attempts
to
guard
trade
communications
were
useless
without
the
command
of
the
home
waters
in
the
north
sea
and
the
truth
received
a
clinching
moral
emphasis
from
the
british
claim
to
the
actual
dominion
of
the
narrow
seas
it
was
in
fact
a
war
which
resembled
rather
the
continental
conditions
of
territorial
conquest
than
the
naval
procedure
that
characterised
our
rivalry
with
france
is
it
then
possible
however
much
we
may
resist
the
conclusion
in
loyalty
to
the
tradition
that
the
rise
of
a
new
naval
power
in
the
room
of
holland
must
bring
us
back
to
the
drastic
if
crude
methods
of
the
dutch
wars
and
force
us
to
tread
under
foot
the
nicer
ingenuity
of
anson
system
is
it
this
which
has
tempted
us
to
mistrust
any
type
of
vessel
which
can
not
be
flung
into
the
battle
the
recurrence
of
a
formidable
rival
in
the
north
sea
was
certainly
not
the
first
cause
of
the
reaction
it
began
before
that
menace
arose
still
it
has
undoubtedly
forced
the
pace
and
even
if
it
be
not
a
cause
it
may
well
be
a
justification

concentration
and
dispersal
of

from
the
point
of
view
of

which
its
ends
are
obtained
strategy
is
often
described
as
the
art
of
assembling
the
utmost
force
at
the
right
time
and
place
and
this
method
is
called

at
first
sight
the
term
seems
simple
and
expressive
enough
but
on
analysis
it
will
be
found
to
include
several
distinct
ideas
to
all
of
which
the
term
is
applied
indifferently
the
result
is
a
source
of
some
confusion

to
the
most
lucid
writers
the
word

says
one
of
the
most
recent
of
them

a
grouping
of
forces
we
believe
in
fact
that
we
can
not
make
war
without
grouping
ships
into
squadrons
and
squadrons
into
fleets
here
in
one
sentence
the
word
hovers
between
the
formation
of
fleets
and
their
strategical
distribution
similar
looseness
will
embarrass
the
student
at
every
turn
at
one
time
he
will
find
the
word
used
to
express
the
antithesis
of
division
or
dispersal
of
force
at
another
to
express
strategic
deployment
which
implies
division
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
he
will
find
it
used
of
the
process
of
assembling
a
force
as
well
as
of
the
state
of
a
force
when
the
process
is
complete
the
truth
is
that
the
term
which
is
one
of
the
most
common
and
most
necessary
in
strategical
discussion
has
never
acquired
a
very
precise
meaning
and
this
lack
of
precision
is
one
of
the
commonest
causes
of
conflicting
opinion
and
questionable
judgments
no
strategical
term
indeed
calls
more
urgently
for
a
clear
determination
of
the
ideas
for
which
it
stands

note
military
phraseology
from
which
the
word
is
taken
employs
concentration
in
three
senses
it
is
used
for
assembling
the
units
of
an
army
after
they
have
been
mobilised
in
this
sense
concentration
is
mainly
an
administrative
process
logically
it
means
the
complement
of
the
process
of
mobilisation
whereby
the
army
realises
its
war
organisation
and
becomes
ready
to
take
the
field
in
a
second
sense
it
is
used
for
the
process
of
moving
the
army
when
formed
or
in
process
of
formation
to
the
localities
from
which
operations
can
best
begin
this
is
a
true
strategical
stage
and
it
culminates
in
what
is
known
as
strategic
deployment
finally
it
is
used
for
the
ultimate
stage
when
the
army
so
deployed
is
closed
up
upon
a
definite
line
of
operations
in
immediate
readiness
for
tactical
deployment
gathered
up
that
is
to
deal
a
concentrated
blow
well
as
this
terminology
appears
to
serve
on
land
where
the
processes
tend
to
overlap
something
more
exact
is
required
if
we
try
to
extend
it
to
the
sea
such
extension
magnifies
the
error
at
every
step
and
clear
thinking
becomes
difficult
even
if
we
set
aside
the
first
meaning
that
is
the
final
stage
of
mobilisation
we
have
still
to
deal
with
the
two
others
which
in
a
great
measure
are
mutually
contradictory
the
essential
distinction
of
strategic
deployment
which
contemplates
dispersal
with
a
view
to
a
choice
of
combinations
is
flexibility
and
free
movement
the
characteristic
of
an
army
massed
for
a
blow
is
rigidity
and
restricted
mobility
in
the
one
sense
of
concentration
we
contemplate
a
disposal
of
force
which
will
conceal
our
intention
from
the
enemy
and
will
permit
us
to
adapt
our
movements
to
the
plan
of
operations
he
develops
in
the
other
strategic
concealment
is
at
an
end
we
have
made
our
choice
and
are
committed
to
a
definite
operation
clearly
then
if
we
would
apply
the
principles
of
land
concentration
to
naval
warfare
it
is
desirable
to
settle
which
of
the
two
phases
of
an
operation
we
mean
by
the
term
which
meaning
then
is
most
closely
connected
with
the
ordinary
use
of
the
word
the
dictionaries
define
concentration
as
the
state
of
being
brought
to
a
common
point
or
centre
and
this
coincides
very
exactly
with
the
stage
of
a
war
plan
which
intervenes
between
the
completion
of
mobilisation
and
the
final
massing
or
deployment
for
battle
it
is
an
incomplete
and
continuing
act
its
ultimate
consequence
is
the
mass
it
is
a
method
of
securing
mass
at
the
right
time
and
place
as
we
have
seen
the
essence
of
the
state
of
strategic
deployment
to
which
it
leads
is
flexibility
in
war
the
choice
of
time
and
place
will
always
be
influenced
by
the
dispositions
and
movements
or
by
our
desire
to
deal
him
an
unexpected
blow
the
merit
of
concentration
then
in
this
sense
is
its
power
of
permitting
us
to
form
our
mass
in
time
at
one
of
the
greatest
number
of
different
points
where
mass
may
be
required
it
is
for
this
stage
that
the
more
recent
incline
to
specialise
concentration
qualifying
it
as
strategic
concentration
but
even
that
term
scarcely
meets
the
case
for
the
succeeding
process
of
gathering
up
the
army
into
a
position
for
tactical
deployment
is
also
a
strategical
concentration
some
further
specialisation
is
required
the
analytical
difference
between
the
two
processes
is
that
the
first
is
an
operation
of
major
strategy
and
the
other
of
minor
and
if
they
are
to
be
fully
expressed
we
have
to
weight
ourselves
with
the
terms
major
and
minor
strategic
concentration
such
cumbrous
terminology
is
too
forbidding
to
use
it
serves
only
to
mark
that
the
middle
stage
differs
logically
from
the
third
as
much
as
it
does
from
the
first
in
practice
it
comes
to
this
if
we
are
going
to
use
concentration
in
its
natural
sense
we
must
regard
it
as
something
that
comes
after
complete
mobilisation
and
stops
short
of
the
formation
of
mass
in
naval
warfare
at
least
this
distinction
between
concentration
and
mass
is
essential
to
clear
appreciation
it
leads
us
to
conclusions
that
are
of
the
first
importance
for
instance
when
once
the
mass
is
formed
concealment
and
flexibility
are
at
an
end
the
further
therefore
from
the
formation
of
the
ultimate
mass
we
can
stop
the
process
of
concentration
the
better
designed
it
will
be
the
less
we
are
committed
to
any
particular
mass
and
the
less
we
indicate
what
and
where
our
mass
is
to
be
the
more
formidable
our
concentration
to
concentration
therefore
the
idea
of
division
is
as
essential
as
the
idea
of
connection
it
is
this
view
of
the
process
which
at
least
for
naval
warfare
a
weighty
critical
authority
has
most
strongly
emphasised
such
he
says
is
concentration
reasonably
understood
not
huddled
together
like
a
drove
of
sheep
but
distributed
with
a
regard
to
a
common
purpose
and
linked
together
by
the
effectual
energy
of
a
single
will
vessels
in
a
state
of
concentration
he
compares
to
a
fan
that
opens
and
shuts
in
this
view
concentration
connotes
not
a
homogeneous
body
but
a
compound
organism
controlled
from
a
common
centre
and
elastic
enough
to
permit
it
to
cover
a
wide
field
without
sacrificing
the
mutual
support
of
its
parts
mahan
of
i
if
then
we
exclude
the
meaning
of
mere
assembling
and
the
meaning
of
the
mass
we
have
left
a
signification
which
expresses
coherent
disposal
about
a
strategical
centre
and
this
it
will
be
seen
gives
for
naval
warfare
just
the
working
definition
that
we
want
as
the
counterpart
of
strategic
deployment
on
land
the
object
of
a
naval
concentration
like
that
of
strategic
deployment
will
be
to
cover
the
widest
possible
area
and
to
preserve
at
the
same
time
elastic
cohesion
so
as
to
secure
rapid
condensations
of
any
two
or
more
of
the
parts
of
the
organism
and
in
any
part
of
the
area
to
be
covered
at
the
will
of
the
controlling
mind
and
above
all
a
sure
and
rapid
condensation
of
the
whole
at
the
strategical
centre
concentration
of
this
nature
moreover
will
be
the
expression
of
a
war
plan
which
while
solidly
based
on
an
ultimate
central
mass
still
preserves
the
faculty
of
delivering
or
meeting
minor
attacks
in
any
direction
it
will
permit
us
to
exercise
control
of
the
sea
while
we
await
and
work
for
the
opportunity
of
a
decision
which
shall
permanently
secure
control
and
it
will
permit
this
without
prejudicing
our
ability
of
bringing
the
utmost
force
to
bear
when
the
moment
for
the
decision
arrives
concentration
in
fact
implies
a
continual
conflict
between
cohesion
and
reach
and
for
practical
purposes
it
is
the
right
adjustment
of
those
two
tensions
ever
shifting
in
force
which
constitutes
the
greater
part
of
practical
strategy
in
naval
warfare
this
concentration
stage
has
a
peculiar
significance
in
the
development
of
a
campaign
and
at
sea
it
is
more
clearly
detached
than
ashore
owing
to
the
vast
size
of
modern
armies
and
the
restricted
nature
of
their
lines
of
movement
no
less
than
their
lower
intrinsic
mobility
as
compared
with
fleets
the
processes
of
assembly
concentration
and
forming
the
battle
mass
tend
to
grade
into
one
another
without
any
demarcation
of
practical
value
an
army
frequently
reaches
the
stage
of
strategic
deployment
direct
from
the
mobilisation
bases
of
its
units
and
on
famous
occasions
its
only
real
concentration
has
taken
place
on
the
battlefield
in
continental
warfare
then
there
is
less
difficulty
in
using
the
term
to
cover
all
three
processes
their
tendency
is
always
to
overlap
but
at
sea
where
communications
are
free
and
unrestricted
by
obstacles
and
where
mobility
is
high
they
are
susceptible
of
sharper
differentiation
the
normal
course
is
for
a
fleet
to
assemble
at
a
naval
port
thence
by
a
distinct
movement
it
proceeds
to
the
strategical
centre
and
reaches
out
in
divisions
as
required
the
concentration
about
that
centre
may
be
very
far
from
a
mass
and
the
final
formation
of
the
mass
will
bear
no
resemblance
to
either
of
the
previous
movements
and
will
be
quite
distinct
but
free
as
a
fleet
is
from
the
special
fetters
of
an
army
there
always
exist
at
sea
peculiar
conditions
of
friction
which
clog
its
freedom
of
disposition
one
source
of
this
friction
is
commerce
protection
however
much
our
war
plan
may
press
for
close
concentration
the
need
of
commerce
protection
will
always
be
calling
for
dispersal
the
other
source
is
the
peculiar
freedom
and
secrecy
of
movements
at
sea
as
the
sea
knows
no
roads
to
limit
or
indicate
our
own
lines
of
operation
so
it
tells
little
about
those
of
the
enemy
the
most
distant
and
widely
dispersed
points
must
be
kept
in
view
as
possible
objectives
of
the
enemy
when
we
add
to
this
that
two
or
more
fleets
can
act
in
conjunction
from
widely
separated
bases
with
far
greater
certainty
than
is
possible
for
armies
it
is
obvious
that
the
variety
of
combinations
is
much
higher
at
sea
than
on
land
and
variety
of
combination
is
in
constant
opposition
to
the
central
mass
it
follows
that
so
long
as
the
enemy
fleet
is
divided
and
thereby
retains
various
possibilities
of
either
concentrated
or
sporadic
action
our
distribution
will
be
dictated
by
the
need
of
being
able
to
deal
with
a
variety
of
combinations
and
to
protect
a
variety
of
objectives
our
concentrations
must
therefore
be
kept
as
open
and
flexible
as
possible
history
accordingly
shows
us
that
the
riper
and
fresher
our
experience
and
the
surer
our
grip
of
war
the
looser
were
our
concentrations
the
idea
of
massing
as
a
virtue
in
itself
is
bred
in
peace
and
not
in
war
it
indicates
the
debilitating
idea
that
in
war
we
must
seek
rather
to
avoid
than
to
inflict
defeat
true
advocates
of
the
mass
entrench
themselves
in
the
plausible
conception
that
their
aim
is
to
inflict
crushing
defeats
but
this
too
is
an
idea
of
peace
war
has
proved
to
the
hilt
that
victories
have
not
only
to
be
won
but
worked
for
they
must
be
worked
for
by
bold
strategical
combinations
which
as
a
rule
entail
at
least
apparent
dispersal
they
can
only
be
achieved
by
taking
risks
and
the
greatest
and
most
effective
of
these
is
division
the
effect
of
prolonged
peace
has
been
to
make
concentration
a
kind
of
shibboleth
so
that
the
division
of
a
fleet
tends
almost
to
be
regarded
as
a
sure
mark
of
bad
leadership
critics
have
come
to
lose
sight
of
the
old
war
experience
that
without
division
no
strategical
combinations
are
possible
in
truth
they
must
be
founded
on
division
division
is
bad
only
when
it
is
pushed
beyond
the
limits
of
deployment
it
is
theoretically
wrong
to
place
a
section
of
the
fleet
in
such
a
position
that
it
may
be
prevented
from
falling
back
on
its
strategical
centre
when
it
is
encountered
by
a
superior
force
such
retreats
of
course
can
never
be
made
certain
they
will
always
depend
in
some
measure
on
the
skill
and
resource
of
the
opposing
commanders
and
on
the
chances
of
weather
but
risks
must
be
taken
if
we
risk
nothing
we
shall
seldom
perform
anything
the
great
leader
is
the
man
who
can
measure
rightly
to
what
breadth
of
deployment
he
can
stretch
his
concentration
this
power
of
bold
and
sure
adjustment
between
cohesion
and
reach
is
indeed
a
supreme
test
of
that
judgment
which
in
the
conduct
of
war
takes
the
place
of
strategical
theory
in
british
naval
history
examples
of
faulty
division
are
hard
to
find
the
case
most
commonly
cited
is
an
early
one
it
occurred
in
during
the
second
dutch
war
monk
and
rupert
were
in
command
of
the
main
fleet
which
from
its
mobilisation
bases
in
the
thames
and
at
spithead
had
concentrated
in
the
downs
there
they
were
awaiting
de
ruyter
putting
to
sea
in
a
position
from
which
they
could
deal
with
him
whether
his
object
was
an
attack
on
the
thames
or
to
join
hands
with
the
french
in
this
position
a
rumour
reached
them
that
the
toulon
squadron
was
on
its
way
to
the
channel
to
with
the
dutch
upon
this
false
intelligence
the
fleet
was
divided
and
rupert
went
back
to
portsmouth
to
cover
that
position
in
case
it
might
be
the
french
objective
de
ruyter
at
once
put
to
sea
with
a
fleet
greatly
superior
to
monk
division
monk
however
taking
advantage
of
thick
weather
that
had
supervened
surprised
him
at
anchor
and
believing
he
had
a
sufficient
tactical
advantage
attacked
him
impetuously
meanwhile
the
real
situation
became
known
there
was
no
french
fleet
and
rupert
was
recalled
he
succeeded
in
rejoining
monk
after
his
action
with
de
ruyter
had
lasted
three
days
in
the
course
of
it
monk
had
been
very
severely
handled
and
forced
to
retreat
to
the
thames
and
it
was
generally
believed
that
it
was
only
the
belated
arrival
of
rupert
that
saved
us
from
a
real
disaster
the
strategy
in
this
case
is
usually
condemned
out
of
hand
and
made
to
bear
the
entire
blame
of
the
reverse
monk
who
as
a
soldier
had
proved
himself
one
of
the
finest
strategists
of
the
time
is
held
to
have
blundered
from
sheer
ignorance
of
elementary
principles
it
is
assumed
that
he
should
have
kept
his
fleet
massed
but
his
critics
fail
to
observe
that
at
least
in
the
opinion
of
the
time
this
would
not
have
met
the
case
had
he
kept
the
whole
to
deal
with
de
ruyter
it
is
probable
that
de
ruyter
would
not
have
put
to
sea
and
it
is
certain
portsmouth
and
the
isle
of
wight
would
have
lain
open
to
the
french
had
they
come
if
he
had
moved
his
mass
to
deal
with
the
french
he
would
have
exposed
the
thames
to
de
ruyter
it
was
a
situation
that
could
not
be
solved
by
a
simple
application
of
what
the
french
call
the
the
only
way
to
secure
both
places
from
attack
was
to
divide
the
fleet
just
as
in
nelson
in
the
same
theatre
was
compelled
to
divide
his
defence
force
in
neither
case
was
division
a
fault
because
it
was
a
necessity
the
fault
in
monk
and
rupert
case
was
that
they
extended
their
reach
with
no
proper
provision
to
preserve
cohesion
close
cruiser
connection
should
have
been
maintained
between
the
two
divisions
and
monk
should
not
have
engaged
deeply
till
he
felt
rupert
at
his
elbow
this
we
are
told
was
the
opinion
of
most
of
his
they
held
that
he
should
not
have
fought
when
he
did
his
correct
course
on
kempenfelt
principle
would
have
been
to
hang
on
de
ruyter
so
as
to
prevent
his
doing
anything
and
to
have
slowly
fallen
back
drawing
the
dutch
after
him
till
his
loosened
concentration
was
closed
up
again
if
de
ruyter
had
refused
to
follow
him
through
the
straits
there
would
have
been
plenty
of
time
to
mass
the
fleet
if
de
ruyter
had
followed
he
could
have
been
fought
in
a
position
from
which
there
would
have
been
no
escape
the
fault
in
fact
was
not
strategical
but
rather
one
of
tactical
judgment
monk
the
advantage
of
his
surprise
and
the
relative
fighting
values
of
the
two
fleets
and
believed
he
saw
his
way
to
victory
the
danger
of
division
is
being
surprised
and
forced
to
fight
in
inferiority
this
was
not
monk
case
he
was
not
surprised
and
he
could
easily
have
avoided
action
had
he
so
desired
to
judge
such
a
case
simply
by
using
concentration
as
a
touchstone
can
only
tend
to
set
up
such
questionable
habits
of
thought
as
have
condemned
the
more
famous
division
which
occurred
in
the
crisis
of
the
campaign
of
and
with
which
we
must
deal
later
apart
from
the
general
danger
of
using
either
words
or
maxims
in
this
way
it
is
obviously
specially
unwise
in
the
case
of
concentration
and
division
the
current
rule
is
that
it
is
bad
to
divide
unless
you
have
a
great
superiority
yet
there
have
been
numerous
occasions
when
being
at
war
with
an
inferior
enemy
we
have
found
our
chief
embarrassment
in
the
fact
that
he
kept
his
fleet
divided
and
was
able
thereby
to
set
up
something
like
a
deadlock
the
main
object
of
our
naval
operations
would
then
be
to
break
it
down
to
force
an
inferior
enemy
to
concentrate
is
indeed
the
almost
necessary
preliminary
to
securing
one
of
those
crushing
victories
at
which
we
must
always
aim
but
which
so
seldom
are
obtained
it
is
by
forcing
the
enemy
to
attempt
to
concentrate
that
we
get
our
opportunity
by
sagacious
dispersal
of
crushing
his
divisions
in
detail
it
is
by
inducing
him
to
mass
that
we
simplify
our
problem
and
compel
him
to
choose
between
leaving
to
us
the
exercise
of
command
and
putting
it
to
the
decision
of
a
great
action
advocates
of
close
concentration
will
reply
that
that
is
true
enough
we
do
often
seek
to
force
our
enemy
to
concentrate
but
that
does
not
show
that
concentration
is
sometimes
a
disadvantage
for
we
ourselves
must
concentrate
closely
to
force
a
similar
concentration
on
the
enemy
the
maxim
indeed
has
become
current
that
concentration
begets
concentration
but
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
it
is
a
maxim
which
history
flatly
contradicts
if
the
enemy
is
willing
to
hazard
all
on
a
battle
it
is
true
but
if
we
are
too
superior
or
our
concentration
too
well
arranged
for
him
to
hope
for
victory
then
our
concentration
has
almost
always
had
the
effect
of
forcing
him
to
disperse
for
sporadic
action
so
certain
was
this
result
that
in
our
old
wars
in
which
we
were
usually
superior
we
always
adopted
the
loosest
possible
concentrations
in
order
to
prevent
sporadic
action
true
the
tendency
of
the
french
to
adopt
this
mode
of
warfare
is
usually
set
down
to
some
constitutional
ineptitude
that
is
outside
strategical
theory
but
this
view
is
due
rather
to
the
irritation
which
the
method
caused
us
than
to
sober
reasoning
for
a
comparatively
weak
belligerent
sporadic
action
was
better
than
nothing
and
the
only
other
alternative
was
for
him
to
play
into
our
hands
by
hazarding
the
decision
which
it
was
our
paramount
interest
to
obtain
sporadic
action
alone
could
never
give
our
enemy
command
of
the
sea
but
it
could
do
us
injury
and
embarrass
our
plans
and
there
was
always
hope
it
might
so
much
loosen
our
concentration
as
to
give
him
a
fair
chance
of
obtaining
a
series
of
successful
minor
decisions
take
now
the
leading
case
of
in
that
campaign
our
distribution
was
very
wide
and
was
based
on
several
concentrations
the
first
had
its
centre
in
the
downs
and
extended
not
only
athwart
the
invading
army
line
of
passage
but
also
over
the
whole
north
sea
so
as
to
prevent
interference
with
our
trade
or
our
system
of
coast
defence
either
from
the
dutch
in
the
texel
or
from
french
squadrons
arriving
the
second
which
was
known
as
the
western
squadron
had
its
centre
off
ushant
and
was
spread
over
the
whole
bay
of
biscay
by
means
of
advanced
squadrons
before
ferrol
and
rochefort
with
a
further
squadron
off
the
coast
of
ireland
it
was
able
also
to
reach
far
out
into
the
atlantic
in
order
to
receive
our
trade
it
kept
guard
in
fact
not
only
over
the
french
naval
ports
but
over
the
approaches
to
the
channel
where
were
the
home
terminals
of
the
great
southern
and
western
a
third
concentration
was
in
the
mediterranean
whose
centre
under
nelson
was
at
sardinia
it
had
outlying
at
malta
and
gibraltar
and
covered
the
whole
ground
from
cape
vincent
outside
the
straits
to
toulon
trieste
and
the
dardanelles
when
war
broke
out
with
spain
in
it
was
considered
advisable
to
divide
this
command
and
spanish
waters
outside
the
straits
were
held
by
a
fourth
concentration
whose
centre
was
off
cadiz
and
whose
northern
limit
was
cape
finisterre
where
it
joined
the
ushant
concentration
for
reasons
which
were
personal
rather
than
strategical
this
arrangement
was
not
continued
long
nor
indeed
after
a
few
months
was
there
the
same
need
for
it
for
the
toulon
squadron
had
changed
its
base
to
cadiz
by
this
comprehensive
system
the
whole
of
the
european
seas
were
controlled
both
for
military
and
trade
purposes
in
the
distant
terminal
areas
like
the
east
and
west
indies
there
were
nucleus
concentrations
with
the
necessary
connective
machinery
permanently
established
and
to
render
them
effective
provision
was
made
by
which
the
various
european
squadrons
could
throw
off
detachments
to
bring
up
their
force
to
any
strength
which
the
movements
of
the
enemy
might
render
necessary
wide
as
was
this
distribution
and
great
as
its
reach
a
high
degree
of
cohesion
was
maintained
not
only
between
the
parts
of
each
concentration
but
between
the
several
concentrations
themselves
by
means
of
a
minor
cruiser
centre
at
the
channel
islands
the
downs
and
ushant
concentrations
could
rapidly
cohere
similarly
the
cadiz
concentration
was
linked
up
with
that
of
ushant
at
finisterre
and
but
for
personal
friction
and
repulsion
the
cohesion
between
the
mediterranean
and
cadiz
concentrations
would
have
been
equally
strong
finally
there
was
a
masterly
provision
made
for
all
the
concentrations
to
condense
into
one
great
mass
at
the
crucial
point
off
ushant
before
by
any
calculable
chance
a
hostile
mass
could
gather
there
for
napoleon
best
admirals
who
knew
the
craft
of
the
sea
the
british
fleet
thus
disposed
was
in
a
state
of
concentration
that
nothing
but
a
stroke
of
luck
beyond
the
limit
of
sober
calculation
could
break
decrès
and
bruix
had
no
doubt
of
it
and
the
knowledge
overpowered
villeneuve
when
the
crisis
came
after
he
had
carried
the
concentration
which
napoleon
had
planned
so
far
as
to
have
united
three
divisions
in
ferrol
he
knew
that
the
outlying
sections
of
our
western
squadron
had
disappeared
from
before
ferrol
and
rochefort
in
his
eyes
as
well
as
those
of
the
british
admiralty
this
squadron
in
spite
of
its
dispersal
in
the
bay
of
biscay
had
always
been
in
a
state
of
concentration
it
was
not
this
which
caused
his
heart
to
fail
it
was
the
news
that
nelson
had
reappeared
at
gibraltar
and
had
been
seen
steering
northward
it
meant
for
him
that
the
whole
of
his
enemy
european
fleet
was
in
a
state
of
concentration
their
concentration
of
force
he
afterwards
wrote
was
at
the
moment
more
serious
than
in
any
previous
disposition
and
such
that
they
were
in
a
position
to
meet
in
superiority
the
combined
forces
of
brest
and
ferrol
and
for
that
reason
he
explained
he
had
given
up
the
game
as
lost
but
to
napoleon
unpractised
eye
it
was
impossible
to
see
what
it
was
he
had
to
deal
with
measuring
the
elasticity
of
the
british
naval
distribution
by
the
comparatively
cumbrous
and
restricted
mobility
of
armies
he
saw
it
as
a
rash
and
unwarlike
dispersal
its
looseness
seemed
to
indicate
so
great
a
tenderness
for
the
distant
objectives
that
lay
open
to
his
scattered
squadrons
that
he
believed
by
a
show
of
sporadic
action
he
could
further
disperse
our
fleet
and
then
by
a
close
concentration
crush
the
essential
part
in
detail
it
was
a
clear
case
of
the
enemy
dispersal
forcing
us
to
adopt
the
loosest
concentration
and
of
our
comparative
dispersal
tempting
the
enemy
to
concentrate
and
hazard
a
decision
it
can
not
be
said
we
forced
the
fatal
move
upon
him
intentionally
it
was
rather
the
operation
of
strategical
law
set
in
motion
by
our
bold
distribution
we
were
determined
that
his
threat
of
invasion
formidable
as
it
was
should
not
force
upon
us
so
close
a
concentration
as
to
leave
our
widespread
interests
open
to
his
attack
neither
can
it
be
said
that
our
first
aim
was
to
prevent
his
attempting
to
concentrate
every
one
of
his
naval
ports
was
watched
by
a
squadron
but
it
was
recognised
that
this
would
not
prevent
concentration
the
escape
of
one
division
might
well
break
the
chain
but
that
consideration
made
no
difference
the
distribution
of
our
squadrons
before
his
naval
ports
was
essential
for
preventing
sporadic
action
their
distribution
was
dictated
sufficiently
by
the
defence
of
commerce
and
of
colonial
and
allied
territory
by
our
need
that
is
to
exercise
a
general
command
even
if
we
could
not
destroy
the
enemy
force
the
whole
of
nelson
correspondence
for
this
period
shows
that
his
main
object
was
the
protection
of
our
mediterranean
trade
and
of
neapolitan
and
turkish
territory
when
villeneuve
escaped
him
his
irritation
was
caused
not
by
the
prospect
of
a
french
concentration
which
had
no
anxieties
for
him
for
he
knew
were
provided
for
it
was
caused
rather
by
his
having
lost
the
opportunity
which
the
attempt
to
concentrate
had
placed
within
his
reach
he
followed
villeneuve
to
the
west
indies
not
to
prevent
concentration
but
firstly
to
protect
the
local
trade
and
jamaica
and
secondly
in
hope
of
another
chance
of
dealing
the
blow
he
had
missed
lord
barham
took
precisely
the
same
view
when
on
news
of
villeneuve
return
from
the
west
indies
he
moved
out
the
three
divisions
of
the
western
squadron
that
is
the
ushant
concentration
to
meet
him
he
expressly
stated
not
that
his
object
was
to
prevent
concentration
but
that
it
was
to
deter
the
french
from
attempting
sporadic
action
the
interception
of
the
fleet
in
question
he
wrote
on
its
return
to
europe
would
be
a
greater
object
than
any
i
know
it
would
damp
all
future
expeditions
and
would
show
to
europe
that
it
might
be
advisable
to
relax
in
the
blockading
system
occasionally
for
the
express
purpose
of
putting
them
in
our
hands
at
a
convenient
opportunity
indeed
we
had
no
reason
for
preventing
the
enemy
concentration
it
was
our
best
chance
of
solving
effectually
the
situation
we
have
to
confront
our
true
policy
was
to
secure
permanent
command
by
a
great
naval
decision
so
long
as
the
enemy
remained
divided
no
such
decision
could
be
expected
it
was
not
in
fact
till
he
attempted
his
concentration
and
its
last
stage
had
been
reached
that
the
situation
was
in
our
hands
the
intricate
problem
with
which
we
had
been
struggling
was
simplified
down
to
closing
up
our
own
concentration
to
the
strategical
centre
off
ushant
but
at
the
last
stage
the
enemy
could
not
face
the
formidable
position
we
held
his
concentration
was
stopped
villeneuve
fell
back
on
cadiz
and
the
problem
began
to
assume
for
us
something
of
its
former
intricacy
so
long
as
we
held
the
mass
off
ushant
which
our
great
concentration
had
produced
we
were
safe
from
invasion
but
that
was
not
enough
it
left
the
seas
open
to
sporadic
action
from
spanish
ports
there
were
convoys
from
the
east
and
west
indies
at
hand
and
there
was
our
expedition
in
the
mediterranean
in
jeopardy
and
another
on
the
point
of
sailing
from
cork
neither
barham
at
the
admiralty
nor
cornwallis
in
command
off
ushant
hesitated
an
hour
by
a
simultaneous
induction
they
both
decided
the
mass
must
be
divided
the
concentration
must
be
opened
out
again
and
it
was
done
napoleon
called
the
move
an
but
it
was
the
move
that
beat
him
and
must
have
beaten
him
whatever
the
skill
of
his
admirals
for
the
two
squadrons
never
lost
touch
he
found
himself
caught
in
a
situation
from
which
there
was
nothing
to
hope
his
fleet
was
neither
concentrated
for
a
decisive
blow
nor
spread
for
sporadic
action
he
had
merely
simplified
his
problem
our
hold
was
surer
than
ever
and
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
extricate
himself
he
was
forced
to
expose
his
fleet
to
the
final
decision
we
required
the
whole
campaign
serves
well
to
show
what
was
understood
by
concentration
at
the
end
of
the
great
naval
wars
to
lord
barham
and
the
able
admirals
who
interpreted
his
plans
it
meant
the
possibility
of
massing
at
the
right
time
and
place
it
meant
in
close
analogy
to
strategic
deployment
on
land
the
disposal
of
squadrons
about
a
strategical
centre
from
which
fleets
could
condense
for
massed
action
in
any
required
direction
and
upon
which
they
could
fall
back
when
unduly
pressed
in
this
case
the
ultimate
centre
was
the
narrows
of
the
channel
where
napoleon
army
lay
ready
to
cross
but
there
was
no
massing
there
so
crude
a
distribution
would
have
meant
a
purely
defensive
attitude
it
would
have
meant
waiting
to
be
struck
instead
of
seeking
to
strike
and
such
an
attitude
was
to
our
old
masters
of
war
so
far
we
have
only
considered
concentration
as
applied
to
wars
in
which
we
have
a
preponderance
of
naval
force
but
the
principles
are
at
least
equally
valid
when
a
coalition
places
us
in
inferiority
the
leading
case
is
the
home
campaign
of
it
was
strictly
on
defensive
lines
our
information
was
that
france
and
spain
intended
to
end
the
war
with
a
great
combined
effort
against
our
west
indian
islands
and
particularly
jamaica
it
was
recognised
that
the
way
to
meet
the
threat
was
to
concentrate
for
offensive
action
in
the
caribbean
sea
everything
that
was
not
absolutely
needed
for
home
defence
instead
therefore
of
trying
to
be
strong
enough
to
attempt
the
offensive
in
both
areas
it
was
decided
to
make
sure
of
the
area
that
was
most
critical
to
do
this
the
home
fleet
had
to
be
reduced
so
low
relatively
to
what
the
enemy
had
in
european
waters
that
offence
was
out
of
the
question
while
rodney
took
the
offensive
area
lord
howe
was
given
the
other
his
task
was
to
prevent
the
coalition
obtaining
such
a
command
of
home
waters
as
would
place
our
trade
and
coasts
at
their
mercy
and
it
was
not
likely
to
prove
a
light
one
we
knew
that
the
enemy
plan
was
to
combine
their
attack
on
the
west
indies
with
an
attempt
to
control
the
north
sea
and
possibly
the
straits
of
dover
with
a
dutch
squadron
of
twelve
to
fifteen
of
the
line
while
a
combined
fleet
of
at
least
forty
sail
would
occupy
the
mouth
of
the
channel
it
was
also
possible
that
these
two
forces
would
endeavour
to
form
a
junction
in
any
case
the
object
of
the
joint
operations
would
be
to
paralyse
our
trade
and
annoy
our
coasts
and
thereby
force
us
to
neglect
the
west
indian
area
and
the
two
spanish
objectives
minorca
and
gibraltar
all
told
we
had
only
about
thirty
of
the
line
on
the
home
station
and
though
a
large
proportion
of
these
were
a
good
many
could
not
be
ready
for
sea
till
the
summer
inferior
as
was
the
available
force
there
was
no
thought
of
a
purely
passive
defence
it
would
not
meet
the
case
something
must
be
done
to
interfere
with
the
offensive
operations
of
the
allies
in
the
west
indies
and
against
gibraltar
or
they
would
attain
the
object
of
their
home
campaign
it
was
resolved
to
effect
this
by
minor
counterstrokes
on
their
line
of
communications
to
the
utmost
limit
of
our
defensive
reach
it
would
mean
a
considerable
stretch
of
our
concentration
but
we
were
determined
to
do
what
we
could
to
prevent
reinforcements
from
reaching
the
west
indies
from
brest
to
intercept
french
trade
as
occasion
offered
and
finally
at
almost
any
risk
to
relieve
gibraltar
in
these
conditions
the
defensive
concentration
was
based
on
a
central
mass
or
reserve
at
spithead
a
squadron
in
the
downs
to
watch
the
texel
for
the
safety
of
the
north
sea
trade
and
another
to
the
westward
to
watch
brest
and
interrupt
its
transatlantic
communications
kempenfelt
in
command
of
the
latter
squadron
had
just
shown
what
could
be
done
by
his
great
exploit
of
capturing
guichen
convoy
of
military
and
naval
stores
for
the
west
indies
early
in
the
spring
he
was
relieved
by
barrington
who
sailed
on
april
to
resume
the
ushant
position
his
instructions
were
not
to
fight
a
superior
enemy
unless
in
favourable
circumstances
but
to
retire
on
spithead
he
was
away
three
weeks
and
returned
with
a
french
east
india
convoy
with
troops
and
stores
and
two
of
the
ships
which
formed
its
escort
up
to
this
time
there
had
been
no
immediate
sign
of
the
great
movement
from
the
south
the
fleet
which
had
assembled
at
cadiz
was
occupied
ineffectually
in
trying
to
stop
small
reliefs
reaching
gibraltar
and
in
covering
their
own
trade
the
dutch
however
were
becoming
active
and
the
season
was
approaching
for
our
baltic
trade
to
come
home
ross
in
the
north
sea
had
but
four
of
the
line
to
watch
the
texel
and
was
in
no
position
to
deal
with
the
danger
accordingly
early
in
may
the
weight
of
the
home
concentration
was
thrown
into
the
north
sea
on
the
howe
sailed
with
barrington
and
the
bulk
of
the
fleet
to
join
ross
in
the
downs
while
kempenfelt
again
took
the
ushant
position
only
about
half
the
brest
squadron
had
gone
down
to
join
the
spaniards
at
cadiz
and
he
was
told
his
first
duty
was
to
intercept
the
rest
if
it
put
to
sea
but
as
in
barrington
instructions
if
he
met
a
superior
squadron
he
was
to
retire
up
channel
under
the
english
coast
and
join
hands
with
howe
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
influenza
was
now
raging
in
the
fleet
he
succeeded
in
holding
the
french
inactive
howe
with
the
same
difficulty
to
face
was
equally
successful
the
dutch
had
put
to
sea
but
returned
immediately
they
knew
of
his
movement
and
cruising
off
the
texel
he
held
them
there
and
kept
complete
command
of
the
north
sea
till
our
baltic
trade
was
safe
home
by
the
end
of
may
it
was
done
and
as
our
intelligence
indicated
that
the
great
movement
from
cadiz
was
at
last
about
to
begin
howe
to
whom
a
certain
discretion
had
been
left
decided
it
was
time
to
shift
the
weight
to
his
other
wing
and
close
on
kempenfelt
the
government
however
seemed
to
think
that
he
ought
to
be
able
to
use
his
position
for
offensive
operations
against
dutch
trade
but
in
the
admiral
opinion
this
was
to
lose
hold
of
the
design
and
sacrifice
cohesion
too
much
to
reach
he
informed
them
that
he
had
not
deemed
it
advisable
to
make
detachments
from
his
squadron
against
the
trade
not
knowing
how
suddenly
there
might
be
a
call
for
the
greater
part
of
it
at
least
to
the
westward
in
accordance
therefore
with
his
general
instructions
he
left
with
ross
a
strong
squadron
of
nine
of
the
line
sufficient
to
hold
in
check
and
even
to
take
and
destroy
the
comparatively
weak
ships
of
the
dutch
and
with
the
rest
returned
to
the
westward
his
intention
was
to
proceed
with
all
possible
expedition
to
join
kempenfelt
on
the
coast
of
france
but
this
owing
to
the
ravages
of
the
influenza
he
was
unable
to
do
kempenfelt
was
forced
to
come
in
and
on
june
the
junction
was
made
at
spithead
the
dutch
were
believed
to
have
sixteen
of
the
line
one
seven
and
the
rest
under
sixty
guns
in
ross
squadron
were
one
and
two
eighties
for
three
weeks
so
severe
was
the
epidemic
they
could
not
move
then
came
news
that
the
cadiz
fleet
under
langara
had
sailed
the
day
howe
had
reached
spithead
and
he
resolved
to
make
a
dash
with
every
ship
fit
to
put
to
sea
to
cut
it
off
from
brest
he
was
too
late
before
he
could
get
into
position
the
junction
between
langara
and
the
brest
squadron
was
made
and
in
their
full
force
the
allies
had
occupied
the
mouth
of
the
channel
with
the
addition
of
the
brest
ships
the
combined
fleet
numbered
forty
of
the
line
while
all
howe
could
muster
was
but
amongst
them
were
seven
and
three
eighties
and
he
would
soon
be
reinforced
three
of
ross
smallest
ships
were
recalled
and
five
others
were
nearly
ready
but
for
these
howe
could
not
wait
the
jamaica
convoy
was
at
hand
and
at
all
hazards
it
must
be
saved
what
was
to
be
done
so
soon
as
he
sighted
the
enemy
he
realised
that
a
successful
action
was
out
of
the
question
early
in
the
morning
of
july
being
fifteen
leagues
from
scilly
langara
with
of
the
line
was
seen
to
the
westward
as
soon
wrote
howe
as
their
force
had
been
ascertained
i
thought
proper
to
avoid
coming
to
battle
with
them
as
then
circumstanced
and
therefore
steered
to
the
north
to
pass
between
scilly
and
the
land
end
my
purpose
therein
was
to
get
to
the
westward
of
the
enemy
both
for
protecting
the
jamaica
convoy
and
to
gain
the
advantage
of
situation
for
bringing
them
to
action
which
the
difference
in
our
numbers
renders
desirable
by
a
most
brilliant
effort
of
seamanship
the
dangerous
movement
was
effected
safely
that
night
and
it
proved
an
entire
success
till
howe
was
met
with
and
defeated
the
allies
would
not
venture
into
the
channel
and
his
unprecedented
feat
had
effectually
thrown
them
off
assuming
apparently
that
he
must
have
passed
round
their
rear
to
seaward
they
sought
him
to
the
southward
and
there
for
a
month
beat
up
and
down
in
ineffective
search
meanwhile
howe
sending
his
cruisers
ahead
to
the
rendezvous
off
the
coast
of
iceland
had
taken
his
whole
fleet
about
two
hundred
miles
west
of
the
skelligs
to
meet
it
northerly
winds
prevented
his
reaching
the
right
latitude
in
time
but
it
mattered
little
the
convoy
passed
in
between
him
and
the
south
of
ireland
and
as
the
enemy
had
taken
a
cast
down
to
ushant
it
was
able
to
enter
the
channel
in
safety
without
sighting
an
enemy
sail
ignorant
of
what
had
happened
howe
cruised
for
a
week
practising
the
ships
in
connected
movements
so
particularly
necessary
on
the
present
occasion
then
with
his
fleet
in
fine
condition
to
carry
out
preventive
tactics
in
accordance
with
kempenfelt
exposition
he
returned
to
seek
the
enemy
to
the
eastward
in
order
to
try
to
draw
them
from
their
station
at
scilly
and
open
the
channel
on
his
way
he
learnt
the
convoy
had
passed
in
and
with
this
anxiety
off
his
mind
he
bore
up
for
the
lizard
where
his
reinforcements
were
awaiting
him
there
he
found
the
channel
was
free
from
lack
of
supplies
the
enemy
had
been
forced
to
retire
to
port
and
he
returned
to
spithead
to
make
preparations
for
the
relief
of
gibraltar
while
this
work
was
going
on
the
north
sea
squadron
was
again
strengthened
that
it
might
resume
the
blockade
of
the
texel
and
cover
the
arrival
of
the
autumn
convoys
from
the
baltic
it
was
done
with
complete
success
not
a
single
ship
fell
into
the
enemy
hands
and
the
campaign
and
indeed
the
war
ended
by
howe
taking
the
mass
of
his
force
down
to
gibraltar
and
performing
his
remarkable
feat
of
relieving
it
in
the
face
of
the
spanish
squadron
for
the
power
and
reach
of
a
concentration
there
can
be
no
finer
example
see
post
pp
if
now
we
seek
from
the
above
and
similar
examples
for
principles
to
serve
as
a
guide
between
concentration
and
division
we
shall
find
firstly
this
one
the
degree
of
division
we
shall
require
is
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
naval
ports
from
which
the
enemy
can
act
against
our
maritime
interests
and
to
the
extent
of
coastline
along
which
they
are
spread
it
is
a
principle
which
springs
from
the
soul
of
our
old
tradition
that
we
must
always
seek
not
merely
to
prevent
the
enemy
striking
at
our
heart
but
also
to
strike
him
the
moment
he
attempts
to
do
anything
we
must
make
of
his
every
attempt
an
opportunity
for
a
counterstroke
the
distribution
this
aim
entailed
varied
greatly
with
different
enemies
in
our
wars
with
france
and
particularly
when
spain
and
holland
were
in
alliance
with
her
the
number
of
the
ports
to
be
dealt
with
was
very
considerable
and
their
distribution
very
wide
in
our
wars
with
the
dutch
alone
on
the
other
hand
the
number
and
distribution
were
comparatively
small
and
in
this
case
our
concentration
was
always
close
this
measure
of
distribution
however
will
never
stand
alone
concentration
will
not
depend
solely
upon
the
number
and
position
of
the
enemy
naval
ports
it
will
be
modified
by
the
extent
to
which
the
lines
of
operation
starting
from
those
ports
traverse
our
own
home
waters
the
reason
is
plain
whatever
the
enemy
opposed
to
us
and
whatever
the
nature
of
the
war
we
must
always
keep
a
fleet
at
home
in
any
circumstances
it
is
essential
for
the
defence
of
our
home
trade
terminals
and
it
is
essential
as
a
central
reserve
from
which
divisions
can
be
thrown
off
to
reinforce
distant
terminals
and
to
seize
opportunities
for
counterstrokes
it
is
the
mainspring
as
lord
barham
put
it
from
which
all
offensive
operations
must
proceed
this
squadron
then
being
permanent
and
fixed
as
the
foundation
of
our
whole
system
it
is
clear
that
if
as
in
the
case
of
the
french
wars
the
enemy
lines
of
operation
do
not
traverse
our
home
waters
close
concentration
upon
it
will
not
serve
our
turn
if
on
the
other
hand
as
in
the
case
of
the
dutch
wars
the
lines
do
traverse
home
waters
a
home
concentration
is
all
that
is
required
our
division
will
then
be
measured
by
the
amount
of
our
surplus
strength
and
by
the
extent
to
which
we
feel
able
to
detach
squadrons
for
offensive
action
against
the
enemy
distant
maritime
interests
without
prejudicing
our
hold
on
the
home
terminals
of
his
lines
of
operation
and
our
power
of
striking
directly
he
moves
these
remarks
apply
of
course
to
the
main
fleet
operations
if
such
an
enemy
has
distant
colonial
bases
from
which
he
can
annoy
our
trade
minor
concentrations
must
naturally
be
arranged
in
those
areas
next
we
have
to
note
that
where
the
enemy
squadrons
are
widely
distributed
in
numerous
bases
we
can
not
always
simplify
the
problem
by
leaving
some
of
them
open
so
as
to
entice
him
to
concentrate
and
reduce
the
number
of
ports
to
be
watched
for
if
we
do
this
we
leave
the
unwatched
squadrons
free
for
sporadic
action
unless
we
are
sure
he
intends
to
concentrate
with
a
view
to
a
decisive
action
our
only
means
of
simplifying
the
situation
is
to
watch
every
port
closely
enough
to
interfere
effectually
with
sporadic
action
then
sporadic
action
being
denied
him
the
enemy
must
either
do
nothing
or
concentrate
the
next
principle
is
flexibility
concentration
should
be
so
arranged
that
any
two
parts
may
freely
cohere
and
that
all
parts
may
quickly
condense
into
a
mass
at
any
point
in
the
area
of
concentration
the
object
of
holding
back
from
forming
the
mass
is
to
deny
the
enemy
knowledge
of
our
actual
distribution
or
its
intention
at
any
given
moment
and
at
the
same
time
to
ensure
that
it
will
be
adjusted
to
meet
any
dangerous
movement
that
is
open
to
him
further
than
this
our
aim
should
be
not
merely
to
prevent
any
part
being
overpowered
by
a
superior
force
but
to
regard
every
detached
squadron
as
a
trap
to
lure
the
enemy
to
destruction
the
ideal
concentration
in
short
is
an
appearance
of
weakness
that
covers
a
reality
of
strength
part
three
conduct
of
naval
war
chapter
one
introductory
i
inherent
differences
in
the
conditions
of
war
on
land
and
on
sea
before
attempting
to
apply
the
foregoing
general
principles
in
a
definite
manner
to
the
conduct
of
naval
war
it
is
necessary
to
clear
the
ground
of
certain
obstacles
to
right
judgment
the
gradual
elucidation
of
the
theory
of
war
it
must
be
remembered
has
been
almost
entirely
the
work
of
soldiers
but
so
admirable
is
the
work
they
have
done
and
so
philosophical
the
method
they
have
adopted
that
a
very
natural
tendency
has
arisen
to
assume
that
their
conclusions
are
of
universal
application
that
the
leading
lines
which
they
have
charted
are
in
a
certain
sense
those
which
must
govern
all
strategy
no
one
will
deny
they
are
the
real
pioneers
and
their
methods
must
be
in
the
main
our
methods
but
what
we
have
to
remember
is
that
the
country
we
have
to
travel
is
radically
different
from
that
in
which
they
acquired
their
skill
a
moment
consideration
will
reveal
how
the
differences
are
let
us
ask
ourselves
what
are
the
main
ideas
around
which
all
the
military
lore
turns
it
may
be
taken
broadly
that
the
general
principles
are
three
in
number
firstly
there
is
the
idea
of
concentration
of
force
that
is
the
idea
of
overthrowing
the
enemy
main
strength
by
bringing
to
bear
upon
it
the
utmost
accumulation
of
weight
and
energy
within
your
means
secondly
there
is
the
idea
that
strategy
is
mainly
a
question
of
definite
lines
of
communication
and
thirdly
there
is
the
idea
of
concentration
of
effort
which
means
keeping
a
single
eye
on
the
force
you
wish
to
overthrow
without
regard
to
ulterior
objects
now
if
we
examine
the
conditions
which
give
these
principles
so
firm
a
footing
on
land
we
shall
find
that
in
all
three
cases
they
differ
at
sea
and
differ
materially
take
the
first
which
in
spite
of
all
the
deductions
we
have
to
make
from
it
in
the
case
of
limited
wars
is
the
dominating
one
the
pithy
maxim
which
expresses
its
essence
is
that
our
primary
objective
is
the
main
force
in
current
naval
literature
the
maxim
is
applied
to
the
sea
in
some
such
form
as
this
the
primary
object
of
our
is
to
seek
out
and
destroy
that
of
the
enemy
on
the
surface
nothing
could
look
sounder
but
what
are
the
conditions
which
underlie
the
one
and
the
other
the
practical
value
of
the
military
maxim
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
in
land
warfare
it
is
always
theoretically
possible
to
strike
at
your
army
that
is
if
you
have
the
strength
and
spirit
to
overcome
the
obstacles
and
face
the
risks
but
at
sea
this
is
not
so
in
naval
warfare
we
have
a
fact
which
is
entirely
unknown
on
land
it
is
simply
this
that
it
is
possible
for
your
enemy
to
remove
his
fleet
from
the
board
altogether
he
may
withdraw
it
into
a
defended
port
where
it
is
absolutely
out
of
your
reach
without
the
assistance
of
an
army
no
amount
of
naval
force
and
no
amount
of
offensive
spirit
can
avail
you
the
result
is
that
in
naval
warfare
an
embarrassing
dilemma
tends
to
assert
itself
if
you
are
in
a
superiority
that
justifies
a
vigorous
offensive
and
prompts
you
to
seek
out
your
enemy
with
a
view
to
a
decision
the
chances
are
you
will
find
him
in
a
position
where
you
can
not
touch
him
your
offence
is
arrested
and
you
find
yourself
in
what
at
least
theoretically
is
the
weakest
general
position
known
to
war
this
was
one
of
our
earliest
discoveries
in
strategy
it
followed
indeed
immediately
and
inevitably
upon
our
discovery
that
the
most
drastic
way
of
making
war
was
to
concentrate
every
effort
on
the
enemy
armed
forces
in
dealing
with
the
theory
of
war
in
general
a
caveat
has
already
been
entered
against
the
too
common
assumption
that
this
method
was
an
invention
of
napoleon
or
frederick
or
that
it
was
a
foreign
importation
at
all
in
the
view
at
least
of
our
own
military
historians
the
idea
was
born
in
our
civil
wars
with
cromwell
and
the
new
model
army
it
was
the
conspicuous
feature
that
distinguished
our
civil
war
from
all
previous
wars
of
modern
times
so
astonishing
was
its
success
as
foreign
observers
remarked
that
it
was
naturally
applied
by
our
at
sea
so
soon
as
war
broke
out
with
the
dutch
whatever
may
be
the
claims
of
the
cromwellian
soldiers
to
have
invented
for
land
warfare
what
is
regarded
abroad
as
the
chief
characteristic
of
the
napoleonic
method
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
they
deserve
the
credit
of
it
at
sea
all
three
dutch
wars
had
a
commercial
object
and
yet
after
the
first
campaign
the
general
idea
never
was
to
make
the
enemy
commerce
a
primary
objective
that
place
was
occupied
throughout
by
their
and
under
monk
and
rupert
at
least
those
objectives
were
pursued
with
a
singleness
of
purpose
and
a
persistent
vehemence
that
was
entirely
napoleonic
but
in
the
later
stages
of
the
struggle
when
we
began
to
gain
a
preponderance
it
was
found
that
the
method
ceased
to
work
the
attempt
to
seek
the
enemy
with
a
view
to
a
decisive
action
was
again
and
again
frustrated
by
his
retiring
to
his
own
coasts
where
either
we
could
not
reach
him
or
his
facilities
for
retreat
made
a
decisive
result
impossible
he
assumed
in
fact
a
defensive
attitude
with
which
we
were
powerless
to
deal
and
in
the
true
spirit
of
defence
he
sprang
out
from
time
to
time
to
deal
us
a
counterstroke
as
he
saw
his
opportunity
it
was
soon
perceived
that
the
only
way
of
dealing
with
this
attitude
was
to
adopt
some
means
of
forcing
the
enemy
to
sea
and
compelling
him
to
expose
himself
to
the
decision
we
sought
the
most
cogent
means
at
hand
was
to
threaten
his
commerce
instead
therefore
of
attempting
to
seek
out
his
fleet
directly
our
own
would
sit
upon
the
fairway
of
his
trade
either
on
the
dogger
bank
or
elsewhere
thereby
setting
up
a
situation
which
it
was
hoped
would
cost
him
either
his
trade
or
his
or
possibly
both
thus
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
with
our
increasing
preponderance
our
preoccupation
with
the
idea
of
battle
decision
had
become
stronger
than
ever
we
found
ourselves
forced
to
fall
back
upon
subsidiary
operations
of
an
ulterior
strategical
character
it
is
a
curious
paradox
but
it
is
one
that
seems
inherent
in
the
special
feature
of
naval
war
which
permits
the
armed
force
to
be
removed
from
the
board
altogether
the
second
distinguishing
characteristic
of
naval
warfare
which
relates
to
the
communication
idea
is
not
so
well
marked
but
it
is
scarcely
less
important
it
will
be
recalled
that
this
characteristic
is
concerned
with
lines
of
communication
in
so
far
as
they
tend
to
determine
lines
of
operation
it
is
a
simple
question
of
roads
and
obstacles
in
land
warfare
we
can
determine
with
some
precision
the
limits
and
direction
of
our
enemy
possible
movements
we
know
that
they
must
be
determined
mainly
by
roads
and
obstacles
but
afloat
neither
roads
nor
obstacles
exist
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
on
the
face
of
the
sea
to
assist
us
in
locating
him
and
determining
his
movements
true
it
is
that
in
sailing
days
his
movements
were
to
some
extent
limited
by
prevailing
winds
and
by
the
elimination
of
impossible
courses
but
with
steam
even
these
determinants
have
gone
and
there
is
practically
nothing
to
limit
the
freedom
of
his
movement
except
the
exigencies
of
fuel
consequently
in
seeking
to
strike
our
enemy
the
liability
to
miss
him
is
much
greater
at
sea
than
on
land
and
the
chances
of
being
eluded
by
the
enemy
whom
we
are
seeking
to
bring
to
battle
become
so
serious
a
check
upon
our
offensive
action
as
to
compel
us
to
handle
the
maxim
of
seeking
out
the
enemy
fleet
with
caution
the
difficulty
obtruded
itself
from
the
moment
the
idea
was
born
it
may
be
traced
back
so
far
at
least
as
modern
warfare
is
concerned
to
sir
francis
drake
famous
appreciation
in
the
year
of
the
armada
this
memorable
despatch
was
written
when
an
acute
difference
of
opinion
had
arisen
as
to
whether
it
were
better
to
hold
our
fleet
back
in
home
waters
or
to
send
it
forward
to
the
coast
of
spain
the
enemy
objective
was
very
uncertain
we
could
not
tell
whether
the
blow
was
to
fall
in
the
channel
or
ireland
or
scotland
and
the
situation
was
complicated
by
a
spanish
army
of
invasion
ready
to
cross
from
the
flemish
coast
and
the
possibility
of
combined
action
by
the
guises
from
france
drake
was
for
solving
the
problem
by
taking
station
off
the
armada
port
of
departure
and
fully
aware
of
the
risk
such
a
move
entailed
he
fortified
his
purely
strategical
reasons
with
moral
considerations
of
the
highest
moment
but
the
government
was
unconvinced
not
as
is
usually
assumed
out
of
sheer
pusillanimity
and
lack
of
strategical
insight
but
because
the
chances
of
drake
missing
contact
were
too
great
if
the
armada
should
sail
before
our
own
fleet
could
get
into
position
our
third
elementary
principle
is
the
idea
of
concentration
of
effort
and
the
third
characteristic
of
naval
warfare
which
clashes
with
it
is
that
over
and
above
the
duty
of
winning
battles
fleets
are
charged
with
the
duty
of
protecting
commerce
in
land
warfare
at
least
since
laying
waste
an
undefended
part
of
your
enemy
country
ceased
to
be
a
recognised
strategical
operation
there
is
no
corresponding
deflection
of
purely
military
operations
it
is
idle
for
purists
to
tell
us
that
the
deflection
of
commerce
protection
should
not
be
permitted
to
turn
us
from
our
main
purpose
we
have
to
do
with
the
hard
facts
of
war
and
experience
tells
us
that
for
economic
reasons
alone
apart
from
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
no
one
has
ever
found
it
possible
to
ignore
the
deflection
entirely
so
vital
indeed
is
financial
vigour
in
war
that
more
often
than
not
the
maintenance
of
the
flow
of
trade
has
been
felt
as
a
paramount
consideration
even
in
the
best
days
of
our
dutch
wars
when
the
whole
plan
was
based
on
ignoring
the
enemy
commerce
as
an
objective
we
found
ourselves
at
times
forced
to
protect
our
own
trade
with
seriously
disturbing
results
nor
is
it
more
profitable
to
declare
that
the
only
sound
way
to
protect
your
commerce
is
to
destroy
the
enemy
fleet
as
an
enunciation
of
a
principle
it
is
a
truism
no
one
would
dispute
it
as
a
canon
of
practical
strategy
it
is
untrue
for
here
our
first
deflection
again
asserts
itself
what
are
you
to
do
if
the
enemy
refuses
to
permit
you
to
destroy
his
fleets
you
can
not
leave
your
trade
exposed
to
squadronal
or
cruiser
raids
while
you
await
your
opportunity
and
the
more
you
concentrate
your
force
and
efforts
to
secure
the
desired
decision
the
more
you
will
expose
your
trade
to
sporadic
attack
the
result
is
that
you
are
not
always
free
to
adopt
the
plan
which
is
best
calculated
to
bring
your
enemy
to
a
decision
you
may
find
yourself
compelled
to
occupy
not
the
best
positions
but
those
which
will
give
a
fair
chance
of
getting
contact
in
favourable
conditions
and
at
the
same
time
afford
reasonable
cover
for
your
trade
hence
the
maxim
that
the
enemy
coast
should
be
our
frontier
it
is
not
a
purely
military
maxim
like
that
for
seeking
out
the
enemy
fleet
though
the
two
are
often
used
as
though
they
were
interchangeable
our
usual
positions
on
the
enemy
coast
were
dictated
quite
as
much
by
the
exigencies
of
commerce
protection
as
by
primary
strategical
reasons
to
maintain
a
rigorous
watch
close
off
the
enemy
ports
was
never
the
likeliest
way
to
bring
him
to
decisive
action
we
have
nelson
declaration
on
the
point
but
it
was
the
best
way
and
often
the
only
way
to
keep
the
sea
clear
for
the
passage
of
our
own
trade
and
for
the
operations
of
our
cruisers
against
that
of
the
enemy
for
the
present
these
points
need
not
be
elaborated
further
as
we
proceed
to
deal
with
the
methods
of
naval
warfare
they
will
gather
force
and
lucidity
enough
has
been
said
to
mark
the
shoals
and
warn
us
that
admirably
constructed
as
is
the
craft
which
the
military
strategists
have
provided
for
our
use
we
must
be
careful
with
our
navigation
but
before
proceeding
further
it
is
necessary
to
simplify
what
lies
before
us
by
endeavouring
to
group
the
complex
variety
of
naval
operations
into
manageable
shape
ii
typical
forms
of
naval
operations
in
the
conduct
of
naval
war
all
operations
will
be
found
to
relate
to
two
broad
classes
of
object
the
one
is
to
obtain
or
dispute
the
command
of
the
sea
and
the
other
to
exercise
such
control
of
communications
as
we
have
whether
the
complete
command
has
been
secured
or
not
it
was
on
the
logical
and
practical
distinction
between
these
two
kinds
of
naval
object
as
we
have
seen
that
the
constitution
of
fleets
was
based
in
the
fulness
of
the
sailing
period
when
maritime
wars
were
nearly
incessant
and
were
shaping
the
existing
distribution
of
power
in
the
world
during
that
period
at
any
rate
the
dual
conception
lay
at
the
root
of
naval
methods
and
naval
policy
and
as
it
is
also
the
logical
outcome
of
the
theory
of
war
we
may
safely
take
it
as
the
basis
of
our
analysis
of
the
conduct
of
naval
operations
practically
of
course
we
can
seldom
assert
categorically
that
any
operation
of
war
has
but
one
clearly
defined
object
a
whose
primary
function
was
to
secure
command
was
often
so
placed
as
to
enable
it
to
exercise
control
and
cruiser
lines
intended
primarily
to
exercise
control
upon
the
trade
routes
were
regarded
as
outposts
of
the
to
give
it
warning
of
the
movements
of
hostile
squadrons
thus
cornwallis
during
his
blockade
of
brest
had
sometimes
to
loosen
his
hold
in
order
to
cover
the
arrival
of
convoys
against
raiding
squadrons
and
thus
also
when
nelson
was
asked
by
lord
barham
for
his
views
on
cruiser
patrol
lines
he
expressed
himself
as
follows
ships
on
this
service
would
not
only
prevent
the
depredations
of
privateers
but
be
in
the
way
to
watch
any
squadron
of
the
enemy
should
they
pass
on
their
track
therefore
intelligence
will
be
quickly
conveyed
and
the
enemy
never
i
think
lost
sight
of
instructions
in
this
sense
were
issued
by
lord
barham
to
the
commodores
concerned
in
both
cases
it
will
be
seen
the
two
classes
of
operation
overlapped
still
for
purposes
of
analysis
the
distinction
holds
good
and
is
valuable
for
obtaining
a
clear
view
of
the
field
nelson
to
barham
august
take
first
the
methods
of
securing
command
by
which
we
mean
putting
it
out
of
the
enemy
power
to
use
effectually
the
common
communications
or
materially
to
interfere
with
our
use
of
them
we
find
the
means
employed
were
two
decision
by
battle
and
blockade
of
the
two
the
first
was
the
less
frequently
attainable
but
it
was
the
one
the
british
service
always
preferred
it
was
only
natural
that
it
should
be
so
seeing
that
our
normal
position
was
one
of
preponderance
over
our
enemy
and
so
long
as
the
policy
of
preponderance
is
maintained
the
chances
are
the
preference
will
also
be
maintained
but
further
than
this
the
idea
seems
to
be
rooted
in
the
oldest
traditions
of
the
royal
navy
as
we
have
seen
the
conviction
of
the
sea
service
that
war
is
primarily
a
question
of
battles
and
that
battles
once
joined
on
anything
like
equal
terms
must
be
pressed
to
the
last
gasp
is
one
that
has
had
nothing
to
learn
from
more
recent
continental
discoveries
the
cromwellian
admirals
handed
down
to
us
the
memory
of
battles
lasting
three
and
even
four
days
their
creed
is
enshrined
in
the
robust
article
of
war
under
which
byng
and
calder
were
condemned
and
in
the
apotheosis
of
nelson
the
service
has
deified
the
battle
idea
it
is
true
there
were
periods
when
the
idea
seemed
to
have
lost
its
colour
but
nevertheless
it
is
so
firmly
embedded
in
the
british
conception
of
naval
warfare
that
there
would
be
nothing
left
to
say
but
for
the
unavoidable
modification
with
which
we
have
to
temper
the
doctrine
of
overthrow
use
that
means
said
its
advocate
when
you
can
and
when
you
must
devoutly
as
we
may
hold
the
battle
faith
it
is
not
always
possible
or
wise
to
act
upon
it
if
we
are
strong
we
press
to
the
issue
of
battle
when
we
can
if
we
are
weak
we
do
not
accept
the
issue
unless
we
must
if
circumstances
are
advantageous
to
us
we
are
not
always
able
to
effect
a
decision
and
if
they
are
disadvantageous
we
are
not
always
obliged
to
fight
hence
we
find
the
apparently
simple
doctrine
of
the
battle
was
almost
always
entangled
in
two
of
the
most
difficult
problems
that
beset
our
old
admirals
the
most
thorny
questions
they
had
to
decide
were
these
in
the
normal
case
of
strength
it
was
not
how
to
defeat
the
enemy
but
how
to
bring
him
to
action
and
in
casual
cases
of
temporary
weakness
it
was
not
how
to
sell
your
life
dearly
but
how
to
maintain
the
fleet
actively
on
the
defensive
so
as
at
once
to
deny
the
enemy
the
decision
he
sought
and
to
prevent
his
attaining
his
ulterior
object
from
these
considerations
it
follows
that
we
are
able
to
group
all
naval
operations
in
some
such
way
as
this
firstly
on
the
only
assumption
we
can
permit
ourselves
namely
that
we
start
with
a
preponderance
of
force
or
advantage
we
adopt
methods
for
securing
command
these
methods
again
fall
under
two
heads
firstly
there
are
operations
for
securing
a
decision
by
battle
under
which
head
as
has
been
explained
we
shall
be
chiefly
concerned
with
methods
of
bringing
an
unwilling
enemy
to
action
and
with
the
value
to
that
end
of
the
maxim
of
seeking
out
the
enemy
fleet
secondly
there
are
the
operations
which
become
necessary
when
no
decision
is
obtainable
and
our
war
plan
demands
the
immediate
control
of
communications
under
this
head
it
will
be
convenient
to
treat
all
forms
of
blockade
whether
military
or
commercial
although
as
we
shall
see
certain
forms
of
military
and
even
commercial
blockade
are
primarily
concerned
with
forcing
the
enemy
to
a
decision
our
second
main
group
covers
operations
to
which
we
have
to
resort
when
our
relative
strength
is
not
adequate
for
either
class
of
operations
to
secure
command
in
these
conditions
we
have
to
content
ourselves
with
endeavouring
to
hold
the
command
in
dispute
that
is
we
endeavour
by
active
defensive
operations
to
prevent
the
enemy
either
securing
or
exercising
control
for
the
objects
he
has
in
view
such
are
the
operations
which
are
connoted
by
the
true
conception
of
a
fleet
in
being
under
this
head
also
should
fall
those
new
forms
of
minor
which
have
entered
the
field
of
strategy
since
the
introduction
of
the
mobile
torpedo
and
offensive
mining
in
the
third
main
group
we
have
to
deal
with
the
methods
of
exercising
control
of
passage
and
communication
these
operations
vary
in
character
according
to
the
several
purposes
for
which
the
control
is
desired
and
they
will
be
found
to
take
one
of
three
general
forms
firstly
the
control
of
the
lines
of
passage
of
an
invading
army
secondly
the
control
of
trade
routes
and
trade
terminals
for
the
attack
and
defence
of
commerce
and
thirdly
the
control
of
passage
and
communication
for
our
own
oversea
expeditions
and
the
control
of
their
objective
area
for
the
active
support
of
their
operations
for
clearness
we
may
summarise
the
whole
in
tabulated
analysis
thus
methods
of
securing
command
a
by
obtaining
a
decision

by
blockade

of
disputing

chapter
two
methods
of
securing
command
i
on
obtaining
a
decision
whatever
the
nature
of
the
war
in
which
we
are
engaged
whether
it
be
limited
or
unlimited
permanent
and
general
command
of
the
sea
is
the
condition
of
ultimate
success
the
only
way
of
securing
such
a
command
by
naval
means
is
to
obtain
a
decision
by
battle
against
the
enemy
fleet
sooner
or
later
it
must
be
done
and
the
sooner
the
better
that
was
the
old
british
creed
it
is
still
our
creed
and
needs
no
labouring
no
one
will
dispute
it
no
one
will
care
even
to
discuss
it
and
we
pass
with
confidence
to
the
conclusion
that
the
first
business
of
our
fleet
is
to
seek
out
the
enemy
fleet
and
destroy
it
no
maxim
can
so
well
embody
the
british
spirit
of
making
war
upon
the
sea
and
nothing
must
be
permitted
to
breathe
on
that
spirit
to
examine
its
claim
to
be
the
logical
conclusion
of
our
theory
of
war
will
even
be
held
dangerous
yet
nothing
is
so
dangerous
in
the
study
of
war
as
to
permit
maxims
to
become
a
substitute
for
judgment
let
us
examine
its
credentials
and
as
a
first
step
put
it
to
the
test
of
the
two
most
modern
instances
both
of
them
it
must
be
noted
were
instances
of
limited
war
the
most
usual
form
of
our
own
activities
and
indeed
the
only
one
to
which
our
war
organisation
with
its
essential
preponderance
of
the
naval
element
has
ever
been
really
adapted
the
first
instance
is
the
war
and
the
second
that
between
russia
and
japan
in
the
former
case
the
americans
took
up
arms
in
order
to
liberate
cuba
from
spanish
domination
a
strictly
limited
object
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
nature
of
the
war
was
ever
clearly
formulated
by
either
side
but
in
just
conformity
with
the
general
political
conditions
the
american
war
plan
aimed
at
opening
with
a
movement
to
secure
the
territorial
object
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
they
intended
to
establish
themselves
in
the
west
of
cuba
in
support
of
the
colonial
insurgents
everything
depended
on
the
initiative
being
seized
with
decision
and
rapidity
its
moral
and
physical
importance
justified
the
utmost
risk
and
such
was
the
conformation
of
the
sea
which
the
american
army
had
to
pass
that
a
strictly
defensive
or
covering
attitude
with
their
fleet
could
reduce
the
risk
almost
to
security
yet
so
unwisely
dominated
were
the
americans
by
recently
rediscovered
maxims
that
when
on
the
eve
of
executing
the
vital
movement
they
heard
a
spanish
squadron
was
crossing
the
atlantic
their
own
covering
force
was
diverted
from
its
defensive
position
and
sent
away
to
seek
out
the
enemy
fleet
and
destroy
it
puerto
rico
was
the
most
obvious
point
at
which
to
seek
it
and
thither
admiral
sampson
was
permitted
to
go
regardless
of
the
elementary
truth
that
in
such
cases
what
is
obvious
to
you
is
also
usually
obvious
to
your
enemy
the
result
was
that
not
only
did
the
americans
fail
to
get
contact
but
they
also
uncovered
their
own
army
line
of
passage
and
paralysed
the
initial
movement
in
the
end
it
was
only
pure
chance
that
permitted
them
to
retrieve
the
mistake
they
had
made
had
the
spanish
squadron
put
into
a
cuban
port
in
railway
communication
with
the
main
royalist
army
such
as
cienfuegos
or
havana
instead
of
hurrying
into
santiago
the
whole
campaign
must
have
been
lost
it
appears
now
wrote
admiral
mahan
in
his
of
the
war
with
not
only
that
the
eastward
voyage
of
our
havana
division
was
unfortunate
but
it
should
have
been
seen
beforehand
to
be
a
mistake
because
inconsistent
with
a
well
and
generally
accepted
principle
of
war
the
of
which
was
not
commanded
by
the
conditions
the
principle
is
that
which
condemns
eccentric
movements
by
the
disregard
of
rule
in
this
case
we
uncovered
both
havana
and
cienfuegos
which
it
was
our
object
to
close
to
the
enemy
division
whether
or
not
we
regard
admiral
mahan
exposition
of
the
error
as
penetrating
to
the
real
principle
that
was
violated
the
movement
was
in
fact
not
only
eccentric
but
unnecessary
had
the
americans
been
content
to
keep
their
fleet
concentrated
in
its
true
defensive
position
not
only
would
they
have
covered
their
army
line
of
passage
and
their
blockade
of
the
territorial
objective
but
they
would
have
had
a
far
better
chance
of
bringing
the
spaniards
to
action
the
spaniards
were
bound
to
come
to
them
or
remain
outside
the
theatre
of
operations
where
they
could
in
no
way
affect
the
issue
of
the
war
except
adversely
to
themselves
by
sapping
the
spirit
of
their
own
cuban
garrison
it
is
a
clear
case
of
the
letter
killing
the
spirit
of
an
attractive
maxim
being
permitted
to
shut
the
door
upon
judgment
strategical
offence
in
this
case
was
not
the
best
defence
seeking
out
the
enemy
fleet
was
almost
bound
to
end
in
a
blow
in
the
air
which
not
only
would
fail
to
gain
any
offensive
result
but
would
sacrifice
the
main
defensive
plank
in
the
american
war
plan
upon
which
their
offensive
relied
for
success
to
stigmatise
such
a
movement
as
merely
eccentric
is
to
pass
very
lenient
censure
in
the
war
we
have
a
converse
case
in
which
judgment
kept
the
aphorism
silent
it
is
true
that
during
the
earlier
stage
of
the
naval
operations
the
japanese
did
in
a
sense
seek
out
the
enemy
fleet
in
so
far
as
they
advanced
their
base
close
to
port
arthur
but
this
was
done
not
with
any
fixed
intention
of
destroying
the
russian
fleet
there
was
small
hope
of
that
at
sea
but
rather
because
by
no
other
means
could
they
cover
the
army
lines
of
passage
which
it
was
the
function
of
the
fleet
to
secure
the
true
offensive
operations
being
on
land
never
except
once
under
express
orders
from
tokio
did
either
admiral
togo
or
admiral
kamimura
press
offensive
movements
in
such
a
way
as
to
jeopardise
the
preventive
duty
with
which
the
war
plan
charged
them
still
less
in
the
later
stage
when
everything
depended
on
the
destruction
of
the
baltic
fleet
did
admiral
togo
seek
it
out
he
was
content
as
the
americans
should
have
been
content
to
have
set
up
such
a
situation
that
the
enemy
must
come
and
break
it
down
if
they
were
to
affect
the
issue
of
the
war
so
he
waited
on
the
defensive
assured
his
enemy
must
come
to
him
and
thereby
he
rendered
it
as
certain
as
war
can
be
that
when
the
moment
for
the
tactical
offensive
came
his
blow
should
be
sure
and
sudden
in
overwhelming
strength
of
concentration
and
decisive
beyond
all
precedent
clearly
then
the
maxim
of
seeking
out
for
all
its
moral
exhilaration
for
all
its
value
as
an
expression
of
high
and
sound
naval
spirit
must
not
be
permitted
to
displace
judgment
trusty
servant
as
it
is
it
will
make
a
bad
master
as
the
americans
found
to
their
serious
jeopardy
yet
we
feel
instinctively
that
it
expresses
as
no
other
aphorism
does
the
secret
of
british
success
at
sea
we
can
not
do
without
it
we
can
not
do
with
it
in
its
nakedness
let
us
endeavour
to
clothe
it
with
its
real
meaning
with
the
true
principles
that
it
connotes
let
us
endeavour
to
determine
the
stuff
that
it
is
made
of
and
for
this
purpose
there
is
no
better
way
than
to
trace
its
gradual
growth
from
the
days
when
it
was
born
of
the
crude
and
virile
instinct
of
the
earliest
masters
the
germ
is
to
be
found
in
the
despatch
already
mentioned
which
drake
wrote
from
plymouth
at
the
end
of
march
in
his
arguments
were
not
purely
naval
for
it
was
a
combined
problem
a
problem
of
defence
against
invasion
that
had
to
be
solved
what
he
wished
to
persuade
the
government
was
that
the
kernel
of
the
situation
was
not
so
much
parma
army
of
invasion
in
flanders
as
the
fleet
that
was
preparing
in
spain
to
clear
its
passage
the
government
appeared
to
be
acting
on
the
opposite
view
howard
with
the
bulk
of
the
fleet
was
at
the
base
in
the
medway
within
supporting
distance
of
the
light
squadron
that
was
blockading
the
flemish
ports
in
concert
with
the
dutch
drake
himself
with
another
light
squadron
had
been
sent
to
the
westward
with
some
indeterminate
idea
of
his
serving
as
an
observation
squadron
or
being
used
in
the
mediaeval
fashion
for
an
eccentric
counterstroke
being
invited
to
give
his
opinion
on
this
disposition
he
pronounced
it
vicious
in
his
eyes
what
was
demanded
was
an
offensive
movement
against
the
enemy
main
fleet
if
there
may
be
such
a
stay
or
stop
made
he
urged
by
any
means
of
this
fleet
in
spain
so
that
they
may
not
come
through
the
seas
as
conquerors
then
shall
the
prince
of
parma
have
such
a
check
thereby
as
were
meet
what
he
had
in
his
mind
is
clearly
not
so
much
a
decision
in
the
open
as
an
interruption
of
the
enemy
incomplete
mobilisation
such
as
he
had
so
brilliantly
effected
the
previous
year
for
later
on
he
says
that
next
under
god
mighty
protection
the
advantage
of
time
and
place
will
be
the
only
and
chief
means
for
our
good
wherein
i
most
humbly
beseech
your
good
lordships
to
persevere
as
you
have
begun
for
with
fifty
sail
of
shipping
we
shall
do
more
upon
their
own
coast
than
a
great
many
more
will
do
here
at
home
and
the
sooner
we
are
gone
the
better
we
shall
be
able
to
impeach
them
he
does
not
say
destroy
impeach
meant
to
prevent
clearly
then
what
he
had
in
his
mind
was
a
repetition
of
the
previous
year
strategy
whereby
he
had
been
able
to
break
up
the
spanish
mobilisation
and
impeach
the
armada
from
sailing
he
did
not
even
ask
for
a
concentration
of
the
whole
fleet
for
the
purpose
but
only
that
his
own
squadron
should
be
reinforced
as
was
thought
convenient
the
actual
reasons
he
gave
for
his
advice
were
purely
moral
that
is
he
dwelt
on
the
enheartening
effect
of
striking
the
first
blow
and
attacking
instead
of
waiting
to
be
attacked
the
nation
he
urged
will
be
persuaded
that
the
lord
will
put
into
her
majesty
and
her
people
courage
and
boldness
not
to
fear
invasion
but
to
seek
god
enemies
and
her
majesty
where
they
may
be
found
here
is
the
germ
of
the
maxim
the
consequence
of
his
despatch
was
a
summons
to
attend
the
council
the
conference
was
followed
not
by
the
half
measure
which
was
all
he
had
ventured
to
advise
in
his
despatch
but
by
something
that
embodied
a
fuller
expression
of
his
general
idea
and
closely
resembled
what
was
to
be
consecrated
as
our
regular
disposition
in
such
cases
the
whole
of
the
main
fleet
except
the
squadron
watching
the
flemish
coast
was
massed
to
the
westward
to
cover
the
blockade
of
transports
but
the
position
assigned
to
it
was
inside
the
channel
instead
of
outside
which
tactically
was
bad
for
it
was
almost
certain
to
give
the
armada
the
weather
gage
no
movement
to
the
coast
of
spain
was
permitted
not
necessarily
be
it
remembered
out
of
pusillanimity
or
failure
to
grasp
drake
idea
but
for
fear
that
as
in
the
recent
american
case
a
forward
movement
was
likely
to
result
in
a
blow
in
the
air
and
to
uncover
the
vital
position
without
bringing
the
enemy
to
action
when
however
the
sailing
of
the
armada
was
so
long
delayed
importunity
was
renewed
with
that
of
howard
and
all
his
colleagues
to
back
it
it
brought
eventually
the
desired
permission
the
fleet
sailed
for
coruña
where
it
was
known
the
armada
after
an
abortive
start
from
lisbon
had
been
driven
by
bad
weather
and
something
like
what
the
government
feared
happened
before
it
could
reach
its
destination
it
met
southerly
gales
its
offensive
power
was
exhausted
and
it
had
to
return
to
plymouth
impotent
for
immediate
action
as
the
armada
finally
sailed
when
the
spaniards
appeared
it
was
still
in
port
refitting
and
victualling
it
was
only
by
an
unprecedented
feat
of
seamanship
that
the
situation
was
saved
and
howard
was
able
to
gain
the
orthodox
position
to
seaward
of
his
enemy
so
far
then
the
government
cautious
clinging
to
a
general
defensive
attitude
instead
of
seeking
out
the
enemy
fleet
was
justified
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
drake
from
the
first
had
insisted
it
was
a
question
of
time
as
well
as
place
if
he
had
been
permitted
to
make
the
movement
when
he
first
proposed
it
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
final
stages
of
the
spanish
mobilisation
could
not
have
been
carried
out
that
year
that
is
to
say
the
various
divisions
of
the
armada
could
not
have
been
assembled
into
a
fleet
but
information
as
to
its
condition
was
at
the
time
very
uncertain
and
in
view
of
the
negotiations
that
were
on
foot
there
were
moreover
high
political
reasons
for
our
not
taking
too
drastic
an
offensive
if
a
reasonable
alternative
existed
the
principles
then
which
we
distil
from
this
the
original
case
of
seeking
out
are
firstly
the
moral
value
of
seizing
the
initiative
and
secondly
the
importance
of
striking
before
the
enemy
mobilisation
is
complete
the
idea
of
overthrow
by
a
great
fleet
action
is
not
present
unless
we
find
it
in
a
not
clearly
formulated
idea
of
the
elizabethan
admirals
of
striking
a
fleet
when
it
is
demoralised
as
the
armada
was
by
its
first
rebuff
or
immediately
on
its
leaving
port
before
it
had
settled
down
in
our
next
naval
struggle
with
the
dutch
in
the
latter
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
principle
of
overthrow
as
we
have
seen
became
fully
developed
it
was
the
keynote
of
the
strategy
which
was
evolved
and
the
conditions
which
forced
it
to
recognition
also
emphasised
the
principles
of
seeking
out
and
destroying
it
was
a
case
of
a
purely
naval
struggle
in
which
there
were
no
military
considerations
to
deflect
naval
strategy
it
was
moreover
a
question
of
narrow
seas
and
the
risk
of
missing
contact
which
had
cramped
the
elizabethans
in
their
oceanic
theatre
was
a
negligible
factor
yet
fresh
objections
to
using
the
seeking
out
maxim
as
a
strategical
panacea
soon
declared
themselves
the
first
war
opened
without
any
trace
of
the
new
principle
the
first
campaign
was
concerned
in
the
old
fashion
entirely
with
the
attack
and
defence
of
trade
and
such
indecisive
actions
as
occurred
were
merely
incidental
to
the
process
no
one
appears
to
have
realised
the
fallacy
of
such
method
except
perhaps
tromp
the
general
instructions
he
received
were
that
the
first
and
principal
object
was
to
do
all
possible
harm
to
the
english
and
to
that
end
he
was
given
a
fleet
in
order
to
sail
to
the
damage
and
offence
of
the
english
fleet
and
also
to
give
convoy
to
the
west
seeing
at
once
the
incompatibility
of
the
two
functions
he
asked
for
more
definite
instructions
what
for
instance
was
he
to
do
if
he
found
a
chance
of
blockading
the
main
english
fleet
at
its
base
was
he
to
devote
himself
to
the
blockade
and
leave
the
whole
fleet
of
merchantmen
to
be
a
prey
to
a
squadron
of
frigates
or
was
he
to
continue
his
escort
duty
full
as
he
was
of
desire
to
deal
with
the
enemy
main
fleet
he
was
perplexed
with
the
practical
difficulty
too
often
forgotten
that
the
mere
domination
of
the
enemy
battle
strength
does
not
solve
the
problem
of
control
of
the
sea
no
fresh
instructions
were
forthcoming
to
clear
his
perplexity
and
he
could
only
protest
again
i
could
wish
he
wrote
to
be
so
fortunate
as
to
have
only
one
of
these
two
duties
to
seek
out
the
enemy
or
to
give
convoy
for
to
do
both
is
attended
with
great
difficulties
the
indecisive
campaign
which
naturally
resulted
from
this
lack
of
strategical
grip
and
concentration
of
effort
came
to
an
end
with
partial
defeat
of
blake
off
dungeness
on
november
though
charged
in
spite
of
his
protests
with
a
vast
convoy
the
dutch
admiral
had
sent
it
back
to
ostend
when
he
found
blake
was
in
the
downs
and
then
free
from
all
preoccupation
he
had
gone
to
seek
out
his
enemy
it
was
the
effect
which
this
unexpected
blow
had
upon
the
strong
military
insight
of
the
cromwellian
government
that
led
to
those
famous
reforms
which
made
this
winter
so
memorable
a
landmark
in
british
naval
history
monk
the
most
finished
professional
soldier
in
the
english
service
and
deane
another
general
were
joined
in
the
command
with
blake
and
with
their
coming
was
breathed
into
the
sea
service
the
high
military
spirit
of
the
new
model
army
to
that
winter
we
owe
not
only
the
articles
of
war
which
made
discipline
possible
and
the
first
attempt
to
formulate
fighting
instructions
in
which
a
regular
tactical
system
was
conceived
but
also
two
other
conceptions
that
go
to
make
up
the
modern
idea
of
naval
warfare
one
was
the
conviction
that
war
upon
the
sea
meant
operations
against
the
enemy
armed
fleets
in
order
to
destroy
his
power
of
naval
resistance
as
distinguished
from
operations
by
way
of
reprisal
against
his
trade
and
the
other
that
such
warfare
required
for
its
effective
use
a
fleet
of
ships
specialised
for
war
with
as
little
assistance
as
possible
from
ships
it
was
not
unnatural
that
all
four
ideas
should
have
taken
shape
together
so
closely
are
they
related
the
end
connotes
the
means
discipline
fleet
tactics
and
a
navy
of
warships
were
indispensable
for
making
war
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
term
the
results
were
seen
in
the
three
great
actions
of
the
following
spring
the
first
under
the
three
generals
and
the
other
two
under
monk
alone
in
the
last
he
carried
the
new
ideas
so
far
as
to
forbid
taking
possession
of
disabled
vessels
that
nothing
might
check
the
work
of
destruction
all
were
to
be
sunk
with
as
much
tenderness
for
human
life
as
destruction
would
permit
in
like
manner
the
second
war
was
characterised
by
three
great
naval
actions
one
of
which
after
monk
had
resumed
command
lasted
no
less
than
four
days
the
new
doctrine
was
indeed
carried
to
exaggeration
so
entirely
was
naval
thought
centred
on
the
action
of
the
that
no
provision
was
made
for
an
adequate
exercise
of
control
in
our
own
case
at
least
massing
for
offensive
action
was
pressed
so
far
that
no
thought
was
given
to
sustaining
it
by
reliefs
consequently
our
offensive
power
suffered
periods
of
exhaustion
when
the
fleet
had
to
return
to
its
base
and
the
dutch
were
left
sufficient
freedom
not
only
to
secure
their
own
trade
but
to
strike
severely
at
ours
their
counterstrokes
culminated
in
the
famous
attack
upon
sheerness
and
chatham
that
such
an
opportunity
was
allowed
them
can
be
traced
directly
to
an
exaggeration
of
the
new
doctrine
in
the
belief
of
the
british
government
the
james
fight
the
last
of
the
three
actions
had
settled
the
question
of
command
negotiations
for
peace
were
opened
and
they
were
content
to
reap
the
fruit
of
the
great
battles
in
preying
on
dutch
trade
having
done
its
work
as
was
believed
the
bulk
of
the
for
financial
reasons
was
laid
up
and
the
dutch
seized
the
opportunity
to
demonstrate
the
limitations
of
the
abused
doctrine
the
lesson
is
one
we
have
never
forgotten
but
its
value
is
half
lost
if
we
attribute
the
disaster
to
lack
of
grasp
of
the
doctrine
rather
than
to
an
exaggeration
of
its
possibilities
the
truth
is
that
we
had
not
obtained
a
victory
sufficiently
decisive
to
destroy
the
enemy
fleet
the
most
valuable
lesson
of
the
war
was
that
such
victories
required
working
for
and
particularly
in
cases
where
the
belligerents
face
each
other
from
either
side
of
a
narrow
sea
in
such
conditions
it
was
proved
that
owing
to
the
facility
of
retreat
and
the
restricted
possibilities
of
pursuit
a
complete
decision
is
not
to
be
looked
for
without
very
special
strategical
preparation
the
new
doctrine
in
fact
gave
that
new
direction
to
strategy
which
has
been
already
referred
to
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
whether
to
make
the
enemy
trade
or
his
fleet
the
primary
objective
but
of
how
to
get
contact
with
his
fleet
in
such
a
way
as
to
lead
to
decisive
action
merely
to
seek
him
out
on
his
own
coasts
was
to
ensure
that
no
decisive
action
would
take
place
measures
had
to
be
taken
to
force
him
to
sea
away
from
his
own
bases
the
favourite
device
was
to
substitute
organised
strategical
operations
against
his
trade
in
place
of
the
old
sporadic
attacks
that
is
the
fleet
took
a
position
calculated
to
stop
his
trade
altogether
not
on
his
own
coasts
but
far
to
sea
in
the
main
fairway
the
operations
failed
for
lack
of
provision
for
enabling
the
fleet
by
systematic
relief
to
retain
its
position
but
nevertheless
it
was
the
germ
of
the
system
which
afterwards
under
riper
organisation
was
to
prove
so
effective
and
to
produce
such
actions
as
the
glorious
first
of
june
in
the
third
war
after
this
device
had
failed
again
and
again
a
new
one
was
tried
it
was
charles
the
second
own
conception
his
idea
was
to
use
the
threat
of
a
military
expedition
some
men
in
transports
were
brought
to
yarmouth
in
the
hope
that
the
dutch
would
come
out
to
bar
their
passage
across
the
open
north
sea
and
would
thus
permit
our
fleet
to
cut
in
behind
them
there
was
however
no
proper
coordination
of
the
two
forces
and
the
project
failed
this
method
of
securing
a
decision
was
not
lost
sight
of
anson
tried
to
use
it
in
the
seven
years
war
for
two
years
every
attempt
to
seek
out
the
enemy
fleet
had
led
to
nothing
but
the
exhaustion
of
our
own
but
when
pitt
began
his
raids
on
the
french
coast
anson
who
had
little
faith
in
their
value
for
military
purposes
thought
he
saw
in
them
definite
naval
possibilities
accordingly
when
in
he
was
placed
in
command
of
the
channel
fleet
to
cover
the
expedition
against
malo
he
raised
the
blockade
of
brest
and
took
up
a
position
near
the
isle
of
batz
between
the
enemy
main
fleet
and
the
army
line
of
passage
the
brest
fleet
however
was
in
no
condition
to
move
and
again
there
was
no
result
it
was
not
till
that
there
was
any
clear
case
of
the
device
succeeding
and
then
it
was
not
used
deliberately
it
was
a
joint
expedition
in
the
mediterranean
that
forced
from
napoleon
his
reckless
order
for
villeneuve
to
put
to
sea
from
cadiz
and
so
solved
the
problem
out
of
which
nelson
had
seen
no
issue
lissa
may
be
taken
as
an
analogous
case
but
there
the
italians
treating
the
territorial
attack
as
a
real
attack
instead
of
as
a
strategical
device
suffered
themselves
to
be
surprised
by
the
austrian
fleet
and
defeated
this
instance
serves
well
to
introduce
the
important
fact
that
although
our
own
military
expeditions
have
seldom
succeeded
in
leading
to
a
naval
decision
the
converse
was
almost
always
true
the
attempt
of
the
enemy
to
use
his
army
against
our
territory
has
been
the
most
fertile
source
of
our
great
naval
victories
the
knowledge
that
our
enemy
intends
to
invade
these
shores
or
to
make
some
serious
expedition
against
our
oversea
dominions
or
interests
should
always
be
welcomed
unless
history
belie
herself
we
know
that
such
attempts
are
the
surest
means
of
securing
what
we
want
we
have
the
memories
of
la
hogue
quiberon
and
the
nile
to
assure
us
that
sooner
or
later
they
must
lead
to
a
naval
decision
and
the
chance
of
a
real
decision
is
all
we
can
ask
of
the
fortune
of
war
enough
has
now
been
said
to
show
that
seeking
out
the
enemy
fleet
is
not
in
itself
sufficient
to
secure
such
a
decision
what
the
maxim
really
means
is
that
we
should
endeavour
from
the
first
to
secure
contact
in
the
best
position
for
bringing
about
a
complete
decision
in
our
favour
and
as
soon
as
the
other
parts
of
our
war
plan
military
or
political
will
permit
if
the
main
offensive
is
military
as
it
was
in
the
japanese
and
american
cases
then
if
possible
the
effort
to
secure
such
control
must
be
subordinated
to
the
movement
of
the
army
otherwise
we
give
the
defensive
precedence
of
the
offensive
if
however
the
military
offensive
can
not
be
ensured
until
the
naval
defensive
is
perfected
as
will
be
the
case
if
the
enemy
brings
a
fleet
up
to
our
army
line
of
passage
then
our
first
move
must
be
to
secure
naval
contact
the
vice
of
the
opposite
method
of
procedure
is
obvious
if
we
assume
the
maxim
that
the
first
duty
of
our
fleet
is
to
seek
out
the
enemy
wherever
he
may
be
it
means
in
its
nakedness
that
we
merely
conform
to
the
dispositions
and
movements
it
is
open
to
him
to
lead
us
wherever
he
likes
it
was
one
of
the
fallacies
that
underlay
all
napoleon
naval
combinations
that
he
believed
that
our
admirals
would
behave
in
this
guileless
manner
but
nothing
was
further
from
their
cunning
there
is
a
typical
order
of
cornwallis
which
serves
well
to
mark
their
attitude
it
was
one
he
gave
to
admiral
cotton
his
second
in
command
in
july
on
handing
over
to
his
charge
the
western
squadron
off
ushant
if
the
french
put
to
sea
he
says
without
any
of
your
vessels
seeing
them
do
not
follow
them
unless
you
are
absolutely
sure
of
the
course
they
have
taken
if
you
leave
the
entrance
of
the
channel
without
protection
the
enemy
might
profit
by
it
and
assist
the
invasion
which
threatens
his
majesty
dominions
the
protection
of
which
is
your
principal
object
it
is
indeed
a
common
belief
that
nelson
never
permitted
himself
but
a
single
purpose
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
fleet
and
that
ignoring
the
caution
which
cornwallis
impressed
upon
cotton
he
fell
into
the
simple
trap
but
it
has
to
be
noted
that
he
never
suffered
himself
to
be
led
in
pursuit
of
a
fleet
away
from
the
position
he
had
been
charged
to
maintain
unless
and
until
he
had
made
that
position
secure
behind
him
his
famous
chase
to
the
west
indies
is
the
case
which
has
led
to
most
misconception
on
the
point
from
an
insufficient
regard
to
the
surrounding
circumstances
nelson
did
not
pursue
villeneuve
with
the
sole
or
even
the
primary
object
of
bringing
him
to
action
his
dominant
object
was
to
save
jamaica
from
capture
if
it
had
only
been
a
question
of
getting
contact
he
would
certainly
have
felt
in
a
surer
position
by
waiting
for
villeneuve
return
off
vincent
or
closing
in
to
the
strategical
centre
off
ushant
further
it
must
be
observed
that
nelson
by
his
pursuit
did
not
uncover
what
it
was
his
duty
to
defend
the
mediterranean
position
was
rendered
quite
secure
before
he
ventured
on
his
eccentric
movement
finally
we
have
the
important
fact
that
though
the
moral
effect
of
nelson
implacable
persistence
and
rapidity
was
of
priceless
value
it
is
impossible
to
show
that
as
a
mere
strategical
movement
it
had
any
influence
on
the
course
of
the
campaign
his
appearance
in
the
west
indies
may
have
saved
one
or
two
small
islands
from
ransom
and
a
good
deal
of
trade
from
capture
it
may
also
have
hastened
villeneuve
return
by
a
few
days
but
that
was
not
to
our
advantage
had
he
returned
even
a
week
later
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
raise
the
rochefort
blockade
barham
would
have
had
enough
ships
at
his
command
to
preserve
the
whole
of
his
blockades
as
he
had
intended
to
do
till
the
news
of
villeneuve
precipitate
return
forced
his
hand
before
he
was
ready
if
we
desire
a
typical
example
of
the
way
the
old
masters
used
the
doctrine
of
seeking
out
it
is
to
be
found
not
in
nelson
magnificent
chase
but
in
the
restrained
boldness
of
barham
orders
to
cornwallis
and
calder
their
instructions
for
seeking
out
villeneuve
were
to
move
out
on
his
two
possible
lines
of
approach
for
such
a
time
and
such
a
distance
as
would
make
decisive
action
almost
certain
and
at
the
same
time
if
contact
were
missed
would
ensure
the
preservation
of
the
vital
defensive
positions
barham
was
far
too
astute
to
play
into
napoleon
hands
and
by
blindly
following
his
enemy
lead
to
be
jockeyed
into
sacrificing
the
position
which
his
enemy
wished
to
secure
if
our
maxim
be
suffered
to
usurp
the
place
of
instructed
judgment
the
almost
inevitable
result
will
be
that
it
will
lead
us
into
just
the
kind
of
mistake
which
barham
avoided
ii
blockade
under
the
term
blockade
we
include
operations
which
vary
widely
in
character
and
in
strategical
intention
in
the
first
place
blockade
may
be
either
naval
or
commercial
by
naval
blockade
we
seek
either
to
prevent
an
enemy
armed
force
leaving
port
or
to
make
certain
it
shall
be
brought
to
action
before
it
can
carry
out
the
ulterior
purpose
for
which
it
puts
to
sea
that
armed
force
may
be
purely
naval
or
it
may
consist
wholly
or
in
part
of
a
military
expedition
if
it
be
purely
naval
then
our
blockade
is
a
method
of
securing
command
if
it
be
purely
military
it
is
a
method
of
exercising
command
and
as
such
will
be
dealt
with
when
we
come
to
consider
defence
against
invasion
but
in
so
far
as
military
expeditions
are
normally
accompanied
by
a
naval
escort
operations
to
prevent
their
sailing
are
not
purely
concerned
with
the
exercise
of
command
naval
blockade
therefore
may
be
regarded
for
practical
purposes
as
a
method
of
securing
command
and
as
a
function
of
commercial
blockade
on
the
other
hand
is
essentially
a
method
of
exercising
command
and
is
mainly
an
affair
of
cruisers
its
immediate
object
is
to
stop
the
flow
of
the
trade
whether
carried
in
his
own
or
neutral
bottoms
by
denying
him
the
use
of
trade
communications
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
conduct
of
war
therefore
we
have
two
categories
of
blockade
naval
and
commercial
but
our
classification
must
go
further
for
naval
blockade
itself
is
equally
varied
in
intention
and
must
be
subdivided
strictly
speaking
the
term
implies
a
desire
to
close
the
blockaded
port
and
to
prevent
the
enemy
putting
to
sea
but
this
was
not
always
the
intention
as
often
as
not
our
wish
was
that
he
should
put
to
sea
that
we
might
bring
him
to
action
and
in
order
to
do
this
before
he
could
effect
his
purpose
we
had
to
watch
the
port
with
a
fleet
more
or
less
closely
for
this
operation
there
was
no
special
name
widely
as
it
differed
in
object
from
the
other
it
was
also
usually
called
blockade
and
nelson
protest
against
the
consequent
confusion
of
thought
is
well
known
it
is
not
my
intention
he
said
to
toulon
and
again
my
system
is
the
very
contrary
of
blockading
every
opportunity
has
been
offered
the
enemy
to
put
to
sea
it
is
desirable
therefore
to
adopt
terms
to
distinguish
the
two
forms
close
and
open
express
the
antithesis
suggested
by
nelson
letter
and
the
two
terms
serve
well
enough
to
mark
the
characteristic
feature
of
each
operation
close
blockade
it
is
true
as
formerly
conceived
is
generally
regarded
as
no
longer
practicable
but
the
antithetical
ideas
which
the
two
forms
of
blockade
connote
can
never
be
eliminated
from
strategical
consideration
it
must
always
be
with
the
relations
of
these
two
forms
whatever
shape
they
may
take
in
future
that
the
strategy
of
naval
blockade
is
chiefly
concerned
with
regard
to
commercial
blockade
in
strict
analysis
it
should
be
eliminated
from
an
inquiry
that
concerns
methods
of
securing
command
and
postponed
to
that
section
of
exercising
command
which
deals
with
the
attack
and
defence
of
trade
it
is
however
necessary
to
treat
certain
of
its
aspects
in
conjunction
with
naval
blockade
for
two
reasons
one
that
as
a
rule
naval
blockade
is
indissolubly
united
to
a
subordinate
commercial
blockade
and
the
other
that
the
commercial
form
though
its
immediate
object
is
the
exercise
of
control
has
almost
invariably
an
ulterior
object
which
is
concerned
with
securing
control
that
is
to
say
while
its
immediate
object
was
to
keep
the
enemy
commercial
ports
closed
its
ulterior
object
was
to
force
his
fleet
to
sea
commercial
blockade
therefore
has
an
intimate
relation
with
naval
blockade
in
its
open
form
we
adopt
that
form
when
we
wish
his
fleet
to
put
to
sea
and
commercial
blockade
is
usually
the
most
effective
means
we
have
of
forcing
upon
him
the
movement
we
leave
him
free
to
attempt
by
closing
his
commercial
ports
we
exercise
the
highest
power
of
injuring
him
which
the
command
of
the
sea
can
give
us
we
choke
the
flow
of
his
national
activity
afloat
in
the
same
way
that
military
occupation
of
his
territory
chokes
it
ashore
he
must
therefore
either
tamely
submit
to
the
worst
which
a
naval
defeat
can
inflict
upon
him
or
he
must
fight
to
release
himself
he
may
see
fit
to
choose
the
one
course
or
the
other
but
in
any
case
we
can
do
no
more
by
naval
means
alone
to
force
our
will
upon
him
in
the
long
run
a
rigorous
and
uninterrupted
blockade
is
almost
sure
to
exhaust
him
before
it
exhausts
us
but
the
end
will
be
far
and
costly
as
a
rule
therefore
we
have
found
that
where
we
had
a
substantial
predominance
our
enemy
preferred
to
submit
to
commercial
blockade
in
hope
that
by
the
chances
of
war
or
the
development
of
fresh
force
he
might
later
on
be
in
a
better
position
to
come
out
into
the
open
that
he
should
come
out
and
stake
the
issue
in
battle
was
nearly
always
our
wish
and
it
was
obvious
that
too
rigorous
a
naval
blockade
was
not
the
way
to
achieve
the
desired
end
or
to
reap
the
strategical
result
which
we
might
expect
from
paralysing
his
commerce
consequently
where
the
desire
for
a
decision
at
sea
was
not
crossed
by
higher
military
considerations
as
in
the
case
of
imminent
invasion
or
where
we
ourselves
had
an
important
expedition
in
hand
it
was
to
our
interest
to
incline
the
enemy
mind
towards
the
bolder
choice
the
means
was
to
tempt
him
with
a
prospect
of
success
either
by
leading
him
to
believe
the
blockading
force
was
smaller
than
it
was
or
by
removing
it
to
such
a
distance
as
would
induce
him
to
attempt
to
evade
it
or
both
a
leading
case
of
such
an
open
blockade
was
nelson
disposition
of
his
fleet
off
cadiz
when
he
was
seeking
to
bring
villeneuve
to
action
in
but
merely
to
leave
a
port
open
does
not
fulfil
the
idea
of
open
blockade
and
in
this
case
to
opportunity
and
temptation
nelson
added
the
pressure
of
a
commercial
blockade
of
the
adjacent
ports
in
hope
of
starving
villeneuve
into
the
necessity
of
taking
to
the
sea
finally
in
a
general
comparison
of
the
two
forms
we
have
to
observe
that
close
blockade
is
characteristically
a
method
of
securing
local
and
temporary
command
its
dominating
purpose
will
usually
be
to
prevent
the
enemy
fleet
acting
in
a
certain
area
and
for
a
certain
purpose
whereas
open
blockade
in
that
it
aims
at
the
destruction
of
an
enemy
naval
force
is
a
definite
step
towards
securing
permanent
command
enough
has
now
been
said
to
show
that
the
question
of
choice
between
close
and
open
blockade
is
one
of
extreme
complexity
our
naval
literature
it
is
true
presents
the
old
masters
as
divided
into
two
schools
on
the
subject
implying
that
one
was
in
favour
of
the
close
form
always
and
the
other
of
the
open
form
we
are
even
led
to
believe
that
the
choice
depended
on
the
military
spirit
of
the
officer
concerned
if
his
military
spirit
was
high
he
chose
the
close
and
more
exacting
form
if
it
were
low
he
was
content
with
the
open
and
less
exacting
form
true
we
are
told
that
men
of
the
latter
school
based
their
objections
to
close
blockade
on
the
excessive
wear
and
tear
of
a
fleet
that
it
involved
but
it
is
too
often
suggested
that
this
attitude
was
no
more
than
a
mask
for
a
defective
spirit
seldom
if
ever
are
we
invited
to
compare
their
decisions
with
the
attendant
strategical
intention
with
the
risks
which
the
conditions
justified
or
with
the
expenditure
of
energy
which
the
desired
result
could
legitimately
demand
yet
all
these
considerations
must
enter
into
the
choice
and
on
closer
examination
of
the
leading
cases
it
will
be
found
that
they
bear
a
striking
and
almost
constant
relation
to
the
nature
of
the
blockade
employed
in
considering
open
blockade
three
postulates
must
be
kept
in
mind
firstly
since
our
object
is
to
get
the
enemy
to
sea
our
position
must
be
such
as
will
give
him
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
secondly
since
we
desire
contact
for
a
decisive
battle
that
position
must
be
no
further
away
from
his
port
than
is
compatible
with
bringing
him
to
action
before
he
can
effect
his
purpose
thirdly
there
is
the
idea
of
economy
that
is
the
idea
of
adopting
the
method
which
is
least
exhausting
to
our
fleet
and
which
will
best
preserve
its
battle
fitness
it
is
on
the
last
point
that
the
greatest
difference
of
opinion
has
existed
a
close
blockade
always
tended
to
exhaust
a
fleet
and
always
must
do
so
but
on
the
other
hand
it
was
contended
that
the
exhaustion
is
compensated
by
the
high
temper
and
moral
domination
which
the
maintenance
of
a
close
blockade
produces
in
a
good
fleet
whereas
the
comparative
ease
of
distant
and
secure
watch
tended
to
deterioration
before
considering
these
opposed
views
one
warning
is
necessary
it
is
usually
assumed
that
the
alternative
to
close
blockade
is
watching
the
enemy
from
one
of
our
own
ports
but
this
is
not
essential
what
is
required
is
an
interior
and
if
possible
a
secret
position
which
will
render
contact
certain
and
with
modern
developments
in
the
means
of
distant
communication
such
a
position
is
usually
better
found
at
sea
than
in
port
a
watching
position
can
in
fact
be
obtained
free
from
the
strain
of
dangerous
navigation
and
incessant
liability
to
attack
without
sacrifice
of
sea
training
with
this
very
practical
point
in
mind
we
may
proceed
to
test
the
merits
of
the
two
forms
on
abstract
principles
it
was
always
obvious
that
a
close
naval
blockade
was
one
of
the
weakest
and
least
desirable
forms
of
war
here
again
when
we
say
weakest
we
do
not
mean
least
effective
but
that
it
was
exhausting
and
that
it
tended
to
occupy
a
force
greater
than
that
against
which
it
was
acting
this
was
not
because
a
blockading
fleet
tempered
and
toughened
by
its
watch
and
with
great
advantage
of
tactical
position
could
not
be
counted
on
to
engage
successfully
a
raw
fleet
of
equal
force
issuing
from
port
but
because
in
order
to
maintain
its
active
efficiency
it
required
large
reserves
for
its
relief
so
severe
was
the
wear
and
tear
both
to
men
and
ships
that
even
the
most
strenuous
exponents
of
the
system
considered
that
at
least
a
fifth
of
the
force
should
always
be
refitting
and
in
every
case
two
admirals
were
employed
to
relieve
one
another
in
one
of
the
highest
authorities
in
the
service
considered
that
to
maintain
an
effective
close
blockade
of
brest
two
complete
sets
of
were
necessary
and
that
no
less
than
of
the
squadron
should
always
be
in
port
captain
philip
patton
to
sir
charles
middleton
june
ii
patton
had
probably
wider
war
experience
than
any
officer
then
living
he
was
regarded
as
possessing
a
very
special
knowledge
of
personnel
and
as
vice
admiral
became
second
sea
lord
under
barham
in
now
these
weaknesses
being
inherent
in
close
blockade
necessarily
affected
the
appreciation
of
its
value
the
weight
of
the
objection
tended
of
course
to
decrease
as
seamanship
material
or
organisation
improved
but
it
was
always
a
factor
it
is
true
also
that
it
seems
to
have
had
more
weight
with
some
men
than
with
others
but
it
will
appear
equally
true
if
we
endeavour
to
trace
the
movement
of
opinion
on
the
subject
that
it
was
far
from
being
the
sole
determinant
it
was
in
the
seven
years
war
under
anson
administration
that
continuous
and
close
blockade
was
first
used
systematically
but
it
was
hawke
who
originated
it
in
the
first
three
campaigns
the
old
system
of
watching
brest
from
a
british
western
port
had
been
in
vogue
but
it
had
twice
failed
to
prevent
a
french
concentration
in
the
vital
canadian
theatre
in
the
spring
of
hawke
was
in
command
of
the
channel
fleet
with
the
usual
instructions
for
watching
but
being
directed
to
stand
over
and
look
into
brest
he
intimated
his
intention
unless
he
received
orders
to
the
contrary
to
remain
off
the
port
instead
of
returning
to
torbay
his
reason
was
that
he
had
found
there
a
squadron
which
he
believed
was
intended
for
the
west
indies
and
he
considered
it
better
to
prevent
its
sailing
than
to
let
it
put
to
sea
and
try
to
catch
it
in
other
words
he
argued
that
none
of
the
usual
western
watching
ports
afforded
a
position
interior
to
the
usual
french
route
from
brest
to
the
west
indies
since
rumours
of
invasion
were
in
the
air
it
was
obviously
the
better
course
to
deal
with
the
enemy
squadrons
in
home
waters
and
avoid
dispersal
of
the
fleet
in
seeking
them
out
in
spite
of
extraordinarily
bad
weather
therefore
he
was
permitted
to
act
as
he
advised
with
boscawen
as
relief
the
new
form
of
blockade
was
kept
up
thenceforward
and
with
entire
success
but
it
must
be
noted
that
this
success
was
rather
due
to
the
fact
that
the
french
made
no
further
effort
to
cross
the
atlantic
than
to
the
fact
that
the
blockade
was
maintained
with
sufficient
strictness
to
prevent
their
doing
so
in
certain
states
of
weather
our
fleet
was
forced
to
raise
the
blockade
and
run
to
torbay
or
plymouth
such
temporary
reversions
to
the
open
form
nearly
always
afforded
an
opportunity
for
the
french
to
get
away
to
the
southward
with
two
or
three
days
start
against
any
attempt
however
to
get
to
the
east
or
the
north
in
order
to
dispute
command
of
the
channel
or
other
home
waters
the
system
was
thoroughly
efficient
and
was
unaffected
by
the
intervals
of
the
open
form
it
may
have
been
these
considerations
which
in
the
war
of
american
independence
induced
so
fine
an
officer
as
howe
to
be
strongly
in
favour
of
a
reversion
to
the
old
system
the
vital
theatre
was
then
again
across
the
atlantic
and
there
was
no
serious
preparation
for
invasion
it
should
also
be
borne
in
mind
in
judging
howe
against
hawke
that
in
the
seven
war
we
had
such
a
preponderance
at
sea
as
permitted
ample
reserves
to
nourish
a
close
blockade
whereas
in
the
latter
war
we
were
numerically
inferior
to
the
hostile
coalition
since
it
was
impossible
to
prevent
the
french
reaching
the
west
indies
and
north
america
if
they
so
determined
our
policy
was
to
follow
them
with
equal
fleets
and
reduce
the
home
force
as
low
as
that
policy
demanded
and
as
was
consistent
with
a
reasonable
degree
of
safety
the
force
required
might
well
be
inferior
to
the
enemy
since
it
was
certain
that
all
attempts
upon
the
channel
would
be
made
with
an
unwieldy
and
force
composed
of
spanish
and
french
units
in
howe
opinion
this
particular
situation
was
not
to
be
solved
by
attempting
to
close
brest
and
nothing
can
be
more
misleading
than
to
stretch
such
an
opinion
beyond
the
circumstances
it
was
intended
to
meet
he
did
not
consider
it
was
in
his
power
to
close
the
port
the
enemy
he
held
could
always
be
in
readiness
to
escape
after
a
gale
of
wind
by
which
the
blockading
squadron
would
be
drawn
off
or
dispersed
the
ships
much
damaged
and
the
enemy
enheartened
an
enemy
he
said
is
not
to
be
restrained
from
putting
to
sea
by
a
station
taken
off
their
port
with
a
barely
superior
squadron
the
experience
of
appears
to
contradict
him
then
a
barely
superior
squadron
did
succeed
in
preventing
exit
but
though
the
squadron
actually
employed
was
barely
superior
it
had
ample
fleet
reserves
to
sustain
its
numbers
in
efficiency
it
was
moreover
only
for
a
short
time
that
it
had
to
deal
with
any
real
effort
to
escape
after
may
ganteaume
was
forbidden
to
put
to
sea
there
were
certainly
several
occasions
during
that
famous
blockade
when
he
could
have
escaped
to
the
southward
had
napoleon
wished
it
this
case
then
can
not
be
taken
to
condemn
howe
judgment
his
special
function
in
the
war
plan
was
with
a
force
reduced
to
defensive
strength
to
prevent
the
enemy
obtaining
command
of
our
home
waters
it
was
certainly
not
his
duty
to
undertake
operations
to
which
his
force
was
not
equal
his
first
duty
was
to
keep
it
in
being
for
its
paramount
purpose
to
this
end
he
decided
on
open
blockade
based
on
a
general
reserve
at
spithead
or
helen
where
he
could
husband
the
ships
and
train
his
recruits
while
at
the
same
time
he
protected
our
trade
and
communications
and
harassed
those
of
the
enemy
kempenfelt
than
whom
there
was
no
warmer
advocate
of
activity
entirely
approved
the
policy
at
least
for
the
winter
months
and
in
his
case
no
one
will
be
found
to
suggest
that
the
idea
was
prompted
by
lack
of
spirit
or
love
of
ease
so
far
as
the
summer
was
concerned
there
was
really
little
difference
of
opinion
as
to
whether
the
fleet
should
be
kept
at
sea
or
not
for
during
summer
more
than
compensated
for
the
exhaustion
of
material
likely
to
be
caused
by
intermittent
spells
of
bad
weather
even
for
the
winter
the
two
policies
came
to
much
the
same
thing
thus
in
hawke
blockade
at
the
end
of
during
the
critical
month
from
to
he
was
unable
to
keep
his
station
for
nearly
half
the
time
and
when
he
did
get
contact
with
conflans
it
was
from
torbay
and
not
ushant
still
it
may
be
doubted
if
without
the
confidence
bred
of
his
stormy
vigil
the
battle
of
quiberon
would
have
been
fought
as
it
was
with
all
this
experience
fresh
in
his
mind
kempenfelt
frankly
advocated
keeping
the
fleet
in
port
for
the
winter
suppose
he
wrote
from
torbay
in
november
the
enemy
should
put
to
sea
with
their
fleet
that
is
from
brest
a
thing
much
to
be
wished
for
by
us
let
us
act
wisely
and
keep
ours
in
port
leave
them
to
the
mercy
of
long
nights
and
hard
gales
they
will
do
more
in
favour
of
you
than
your
fleet
can
far
better
he
thought
to
devote
the
winter
to
preparing
the
fleet
for
the
next
campaign
so
as
to
have
the
advantage
of
being
the
first
in
the
field
let
us
he
concluded
keep
a
stout
squadron
to
the
westward
ready
to
attend
the
motions
of
the
enemy
i
do
mean
to
keep
them
at
sea
disabling
themselves
in
buffeting
the
winds
but
at
torbay
ready
to
act
as
intelligence
may
suggest
it
will
be
seen
therefore
that
the
conclusion
that
close
blockade
was
always
the
best
means
of
rendering
the
fleet
most
efficient
for
the
function
it
had
to
perform
must
not
be
accepted
too
hastily
the
reasons
which
induced
howe
and
kempenfelt
to
prefer
open
blockade
were
mainly
based
on
this
very
consideration
having
in
mind
the
whole
of
the
surrounding
conditions
in
their
highly
experienced
opinion
careful
preparation
in
the
winter
and
tactical
evolutions
in
the
summer
were
the
surest
road
to
battle
fitness
in
the
force
available
i
on
the
other
hand
we
have
the
fact
that
during
the
war
of
american
independence
the
open
system
was
not
very
successful
but
before
condemning
it
out
of
hand
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
causes
of
failure
were
not
all
inherent
in
the
system
in
the
first
place
the
need
of
relieving
gibraltar
from
time
to
time
prevented
the
western
squadron
devoting
itself
entirely
to
its
watch
in
the
next
place
owing
to
defective
administration
the
winters
were
not
devoted
with
sufficient
energy
to
preparing
the
fleet
to
be
first
in
the
field
in
the
spring
finally
we
have
to
recognise
that
the
lack
of
success
was
due
not
so
much
to
permitting
the
french
to
cross
the
atlantic
as
to
the
failure
to
deal
faithfully
with
them
when
contact
was
obtained
at
their
destination
obviously
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
for
the
policy
of
seeking
out
as
against
that
of
preventing
exit
unless
you
are
determined
when
you
find
to
destroy
or
to
be
destroyed
it
was
here
that
rodney
and
his
fellows
were
found
wanting
the
system
failed
from
defective
execution
quite
as
much
as
from
defective
design
in
the
next
war
howe
was
still
in
the
ascendant
and
in
command
of
the
channel
fleet
he
retained
his
system
leaving
brest
open
he
forced
the
french
by
operating
against
their
trade
to
put
to
sea
and
he
was
rewarded
with
the
battle
of
the
first
of
june
no
attempt
was
made
to
maintain
a
close
blockade
during
the
following
winter
the
french
were
allowed
to
sail
and
their
disastrous
cruise
of
january
fully
justified
kempenfelt
anticipations
so
great
was
the
damage
done
that
they
abandoned
all
idea
of
using
their
fleet
as
a
whole
howe
system
was
continued
but
no
longer
with
entirely
successful
results
in
the
french
were
able
to
make
descents
upon
ireland
and
howe
in
consequence
has
come
in
for
the
severest
castigations
his
method
is
contemptuously
contrasted
with
that
which
vincent
adopted
four
years
later
without
any
regard
to
the
situation
each
admiral
had
to
meet
and
again
on
the
assumption
that
the
closing
of
brest
would
have
solved
the
one
problem
as
well
as
it
did
the
other
in
we
were
not
on
the
defensive
as
we
were
in
the
french
fleet
had
been
practically
destroyed
no
invasion
threatened
with
a
view
to
forcing
peace
our
policy
was
directed
to
offensive
action
against
french
trade
and
territory
in
order
by
general
pressure
to
back
our
overtures
for
a
settlement
the
policy
may
have
been
mistaken
but
that
is
not
the
question
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
strategy
fitted
the
policy
we
were
also
it
must
be
remembered
at
war
with
holland
and
expecting
war
with
spain
an
eventuality
which
forced
us
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
defence
of
portugal
in
these
circumstances
nothing
was
further
from
our
desire
than
to
keep
what
was
left
of
the
brest
fleet
in
port
our
hope
was
by
our
offensive
action
against
french
maritime
interests
to
force
it
to
expose
itself
for
their
defence
to
devote
the
fleet
to
the
closing
of
brest
was
to
cripple
it
for
offensive
action
and
to
play
the
enemy
game
the
actual
disposition
of
the
home
fleet
was
designed
so
as
to
preserve
its
offensive
activity
and
at
the
same
time
to
ensure
superiority
in
any
part
of
the
home
waters
in
which
the
enemy
might
attempt
a
counterstroke
it
was
distributed
in
three
active
squadrons
one
in
the
north
sea
one
before
brest
and
one
cruising
to
the
westward
with
a
strong
reserve
at
portsmouth
it
is
the
location
of
the
reserve
that
has
been
most
lightly
ridiculed
on
the
hasty
assumption
that
it
was
merely
the
reserve
of
the
squadron
before
brest
whereas
in
truth
it
was
a
general
reserve
designed
to
act
in
the
north
sea
or
wherever
else
it
might
be
needed
at
the
same
time
it
served
as
a
training
and
depot
squadron
for
increasing
our
power
at
sea
in
view
of
the
probable
addition
of
the
spanish
fleet
to
naval
force
to
have
exhausted
our
fleet
merely
to
prevent
raids
leaving
brest
which
might
equally
well
leave
the
texel
or
dunkirk
was
just
what
the
enemy
would
have
desired
the
disposition
was
in
fact
a
good
example
of
concentration
that
is
disposal
about
a
strategical
centre
to
preserve
flexibility
for
offence
without
risking
defensive
needs
and
yet
it
is
by
the
most
ardent
advocates
of
concentration
and
the
offensive
that
dispositions
at
this
time
have
been
most
roundly
condemned
in
the
end
the
disposition
did
fail
to
prevent
the
landing
of
part
of
the
force
intended
for
ireland
but
it
made
the
venture
so
difficult
that
it
had
to
be
deferred
till
and
then
the
weather
which
rendered
evasion
possible
broke
up
the
expedition
and
denied
it
all
chance
of
serious
success
it
was
in
fact
another
example
of
the
working
of
kempenfelt
rule
concerning
winter
weather
so
far
as
naval
defence
can
go
the
disposition
was
all
that
was
required
the
irish
expedition
was
seen
leaving
brest
by
our
inshore
cruiser
squadron
it
was
reported
to
colpoys
who
had
the
outside
and
it
was
only
a
dense
fog
that
enabled
it
to
escape
it
was
in
fact
nothing
more
than
the
evasion
of
a
small
raiding
force
an
eventuality
against
which
no
naval
defence
can
provide
certain
guarantee
especially
in
winter
it
was
under
wholly
different
conditions
that
at
the
end
of
system
was
revived
vincent
succession
to
the
control
of
the
fleet
coincided
with
napoleon
definite
assumption
of
the
control
of
the
destinies
of
france
our
great
duel
with
him
had
begun
the
measures
he
was
taking
made
it
obvious
we
were
once
more
facing
the
old
life
and
death
struggle
for
naval
supremacy
we
were
openly
threatened
with
invasion
and
we
had
a
distinct
preponderance
at
sea
in
short
we
have
to
recognize
the
fact
that
the
methods
of
the
seven
years
war
were
revived
when
the
problems
and
factors
of
that
war
were
renewed
as
those
problems
grew
more
intense
as
they
did
after
the
peace
of
amiens
and
the
threat
of
invasion
became
really
formidable
so
did
the
rigour
of
the
close
blockade
increase
under
cornwallis
and
gardner
it
was
maintained
in
such
a
way
as
to
deny
so
far
as
human
effort
could
go
all
possibility
of
exit
without
fighting
in
spite
of
the
importance
of
dealing
with
the
enemy
squadrons
in
detail
no
risks
were
taken
to
bring
ganteaume
to
decisive
action
our
first
necessity
was
absolute
local
command
the
acuteness
of
the
invasion
crisis
demanded
that
the
brest
fleet
should
be
kept
in
port
and
every
time
ganteaume
showed
a
foot
the
british
admiral
flew
at
him
and
drove
him
back
once
only
during
the
continuation
of
the
crisis
was
the
rigour
of
this
attitude
relaxed
and
that
was
to
deal
with
what
for
the
moment
was
the
higher
object
it
was
to
meet
villeneuve
on
his
return
from
the
west
indies
but
even
then
so
nicely
was
the
relaxation
calculated
that
ganteaume
was
given
no
time
to
take
advantage
of
it
the
analogy
between
the
conditions
of
the
blockade
which
vincent
inaugurated
and
those
of
the
seven
years
war
becomes
all
the
more
significant
when
we
note
that
while
cornwallis
and
gardner
in
home
waters
were
pressing
close
blockade
to
its
utmost
limit
of
rigour
nelson
in
the
mediterranean
was
not
using
it
at
all
yet
with
him
also
the
chief
concern
was
to
prevent
an
invasion
his
main
function
as
he
and
his
government
saw
it
was
to
prevent
a
descent
from
southern
france
upon
neapolitan
or
levantine
territory
why
then
did
he
not
employ
close
blockade
it
is
usually
assumed
that
it
was
because
of
his
overpowering
desire
to
bring
the
toulon
squadron
to
action
occasional
expressions
in
his
letters
give
colour
to
such
a
view
but
his
dispositions
show
clearly
that
his
desire
to
bring
the
fleet
to
action
was
kept
in
scientific
subordination
to
the
defensive
duty
with
which
he
was
charged
close
blockade
was
the
most
effectual
means
of
securing
this
end
but
in
his
case
one
of
the
conditions
which
we
have
found
always
accompanying
successful
close
blockade
was
absent
he
had
no
such
preponderance
of
force
as
would
enable
him
to
nourish
it
up
to
the
point
of
perfect
continuity
in
the
circumstances
the
close
form
was
too
weak
or
exhausting
for
him
to
use
with
the
force
at
his
disposal
if
this
case
be
not
considered
conclusive
as
to
nelson
views
we
have
a
perfectly
clear
endorsement
from
his
pen
in
it
is
a
particularly
strong
testimony
for
he
was
at
the
time
actually
charged
with
defence
against
the
invasion
of
england
with
several
cruiser
squadrons
he
had
to
prevent
the
enemy
force
issuing
from
a
number
of
ports
extending
from
flushing
to
dieppe
and
he
was
directing
the
operations
from
the
downs
on
the
approach
of
winter
he
was
impressed
with
the
inexpediency
of
attempting
to
continue
a
close
blockade
and
wrote
to
the
admiralty
as
follows
i
am
of
opinion
and
submit
to
their
lordships
better
judgment
that
care
should
be
taken
to
keep
our
squadrons
compact
and
in
good
order
under
dungeness
to
be
their
principal
station
in
fine
weather
our
squadrons
to
go
out
and
show
themselves
but
never
to
risk
either
being
crippled
or
drawn
into
the
north
sea
thus
we
shall
always
be
sure
of
an
effective
force
ready
to
act
as
occasion
calls
for
it
to
evan
nepean
september
nicolas
iv
the
case
of
course
is
not
entirely
in
point
for
it
concerns
the
question
of
direct
resistance
to
invasion
and
not
to
securing
general
command
its
value
is
that
it
gives
nelson
views
on
the
broad
question
of
balancing
the
risks
that
is
the
risk
of
relaxing
close
watch
against
the
risk
of
destroying
the
efficiency
of
the
ships
by
maintaining
it
too
rigorously
with
nelson
holding
this
view
it
is
not
surprising
to
find
that
as
late
as
naval
opinion
was
not
quite
settled
on
the
relative
advantages
of
close
and
open
blockade
even
in
the
case
of
threatened
invasion
just
a
year
before
trafalgar
was
fought
cornwallis
pressed
the
admiralty
for
more
strength
to
enable
him
to
keep
his
blockade
efficient
lord
melville
who
at
this
time
had
barham
at
his
elbow
replied
recommending
the
policy
of
relaxing
the
strictness
of
blockade
formerly
resorted
to
he
protested
the
means
available
were
insufficient
for
sustaining
the
necessary
extent
of
naval
force
if
your
ships
are
to
be
torn
to
pieces
by
an
eternal
conflict
with
the
elements
during
the
tempestuous
months
of
winter
melville
was
craving
for
a
decisive
action
to
end
the
insupportable
strain
allow
me
to
remind
you
he
added
that
the
occasions
when
we
have
been
able
to
bring
our
enemy
to
battle
and
our
fleets
to
victory
have
generally
been
when
we
were
at
a
distance
from
the
blockading
station
in
the
end
as
we
know
cornwallis
had
his
way
and
the
verdict
of
history
has
been
to
approve
the
decision
for
its
moral
effect
alone
such
conflicts
must
always
arise
war
as
wolfe
said
is
an
option
of
difficulties
and
the
choice
must
sway
to
the
one
side
or
the
other
as
the
circumstances
tend
to
develop
the
respective
advantages
of
each
form
we
can
never
say
that
close
blockade
is
better
than
open
or
the
reverse
it
must
always
be
a
matter
of
judgment
for
barham
final
views
see
iii
are
there
then
no
principles
which
we
can
deduce
from
the
old
practice
for
the
strengthening
of
judgment
certain
broad
lines
of
guidance
at
least
are
to
be
traced
the
main
question
will
be
is
it
to
our
advantage
in
regard
to
all
the
strategical
conditions
to
keep
the
enemy
in
and
get
him
to
sea
for
a
decision
presumably
it
will
always
be
our
policy
to
get
a
decision
as
soon
as
possible
still
that
desire
may
be
overridden
by
the
necessity
or
special
advantage
of
closely
blockading
one
or
more
of
his
squadrons
this
situation
may
arise
in
two
ways
firstly
it
may
be
essential
to
provide
for
the
local
and
temporary
command
of
a
certain
theatre
of
operations
as
when
an
invasion
threatens
in
that
area
or
when
we
wish
to
pass
a
military
expedition
across
it
or
from
special
exigencies
in
regard
to
the
attack
or
defence
of
commerce
secondly
even
where
we
are
seeking
a
great
decision
we
may
blockade
one
squadron
closely
in
order
to
induce
a
decision
at
the
point
most
advantageous
to
ourselves
that
is
to
say
we
may
blockade
one
or
more
squadrons
in
order
to
induce
the
enemy
to
attempt
with
one
or
more
other
squadrons
to
break
that
blockade
in
this
way
we
may
lead
him
either
to
expose
himself
to
be
struck
in
detail
or
to
concentrate
where
we
desire
his
concentration
for
any
of
these
reasons
we
may
decide
that
the
best
way
of
realising
our
object
is
to
use
close
blockade
but
the
matter
does
not
end
there
we
have
still
to
consider
whether
close
blockade
is
within
the
limit
of
the
force
we
have
available
and
whether
it
is
the
best
method
of
developing
the
fullest
potentialities
of
that
force
close
blockade
being
the
more
exhausting
form
will
require
the
greater
strength
we
can
not
blockade
closely
for
any
length
of
time
without
a
force
relatively
superior
but
if
by
open
blockade
of
a
squadron
we
permit
it
to
put
to
sea
with
contact
assured
we
know
that
even
with
a
slightly
inferior
force
we
can
so
deal
with
it
as
to
prevent
its
getting
local
control
sufficient
to
break
down
our
mobile
flotilla
defence
or
to
interfere
seriously
with
our
trade
finally
there
is
the
question
of
risk
in
the
old
days
before
free
movement
and
wireless
telegraphy
and
before
the
flotilla
had
acquired
battle
power
there
was
always
to
be
faced
the
risk
of
not
getting
contact
in
time
to
prevent
mischief
this
consideration
was
specially
dominant
where
the
enemy
had
a
squadron
within
or
near
the
critical
theatre
of
operations
therefore
when
the
invasion
threatened
our
developed
policy
was
to
blockade
brest
closely
at
almost
any
sacrifice
there
was
always
a
vague
possibility
that
by
evasion
or
chance
of
wind
a
squadron
so
close
to
the
line
of
invasion
might
get
sufficient
temporary
command
in
the
vital
area
before
it
could
be
brought
to
action
it
was
a
possibility
that
was
never
realised
in
the
narrow
seas
and
since
mobility
of
fleets
and
means
of
distant
communication
have
so
greatly
increased
in
range
and
certainty
and
since
the
power
of
resistance
in
the
flotilla
has
become
so
high
the
risk
is
probably
much
less
than
ever
and
the
field
for
open
blockade
is
consequently
less
restricted
there
is
no
need
however
to
accept
these
principles
as
incontrovertible
even
if
we
take
the
great
blockade
of
which
has
most
firmly
dominated
thought
on
the
subject
ever
since
it
may
be
argued
with
some
plausibility
that
the
situation
could
have
been
solved
more
quickly
and
effectually
by
letting
ganteaume
get
out
from
brest
into
the
open
at
least
as
far
as
admiral
togo
was
forced
to
permit
the
russians
to
emerge
from
port
arthur
though
his
reasons
for
keeping
them
in
were
even
stronger
than
ours
in
but
in
any
case
the
whole
trend
of
the
evidence
will
admit
no
doubt
as
to
the
inherent
weakness
of
close
blockade
as
a
form
of
war
as
under
modern
developments
the
possibilities
of
open
blockade
have
increased
so
the
difficulties
and
dangers
of
close
blockade
have
certainly
not
decreased
it
is
also
probable
that
certain
advantages
which
in
the
sailing
era
went
far
to
compensate
for
its
weakness
have
lost
much
of
their
force
a
sailing
fleet
cooped
up
in
port
not
only
rapidly
lost
its
spirit
but
being
barred
from
could
not
be
kept
in
a
condition
of
efficiency
whereas
the
blockading
fleet
was
quickly
raised
to
the
highest
temper
by
the
stress
of
vigilance
and
danger
that
was
its
incessant
portion
so
long
as
the
strain
did
not
pass
the
limit
of
human
endurance
it
was
all
to
the
good
in
the
old
days
with
very
moderate
reliefs
the
limit
was
never
reached
and
the
sacrifices
that
were
made
to
those
exhausting
vigils
were
rewarded
twentyfold
in
exuberant
confidence
on
the
day
of
battle
can
we
expect
the
same
compensation
now
will
the
balance
of
strength
and
weakness
remain
as
it
used
to
be
in
the
face
of
the
vast
change
of
conditions
and
the
thinness
of
experience
it
is
to
general
principles
we
must
turn
for
the
answer
what
in
fact
is
the
inherent
weakness
of
close
blockade
strategical
theory
will
at
once
reply
that
it
is
an
operation
which
involves
an
arrest
of
the
offensive
a
situation
which
is
usually
taken
to
exhibit
every
kind
of
drawback
close
blockade
is
essentially
an
offensive
operation
although
its
object
is
usually
negative
that
is
it
is
a
forward
movement
to
prevent
the
enemy
carrying
out
some
offensive
operation
either
direct
or
by
way
of
counterstroke
so
far
the
common
tendency
to
confuse
seeking
out
the
enemy
fleet
with
making
the
enemy
coast
your
frontier
may
be
condoned
but
the
two
operations
are
widely
different
in
that
they
have
different
objectives
in
seeking
out
our
objective
is
the
enemy
armed
force
in
making
the
enemy
coast
our
frontier
the
objective
is
inseparable
from
the
ulterior
object
of
the
naval
war
in
this
case
the
objective
is
the
common
communications
by
establishing
a
blockade
we
operate
offensively
against
those
communications
we
occupy
them
and
then
we
can
do
no
more
our
offensive
is
arrested
we
can
not
carry
it
on
to
the
destruction
of
the
enemy
fleet
we
have
to
wait
in
a
defensive
attitude
holding
the
communications
we
have
seized
till
he
chooses
to
attack
in
order
to
break
our
hold
and
during
that
period
of
arrest
the
advantage
of
surprise
the
advantage
in
war
passes
by
a
well
recognised
rule
to
our
enemy
we
in
fact
are
held
upon
the
defensive
with
none
of
the
material
advantages
of
the
defensive
the
moral
advantage
of
having
taken
the
initiative
remains
but
that
is
all
the
advantage
which
we
thus
gain
will
of
course
have
the
same
kind
of
depressing
effect
upon
the
blockaded
fleet
as
it
had
of
old
but
scarcely
in
so
high
a
degree
the
degradation
of
a
steam
fleet
in
port
can
scarcely
be
so
rapid
or
debilitating
as
it
was
when
of
seamanship
lay
in
the
smart
handling
of
sails
for
the
blockading
fleet
it
is
also
true
that
the
effects
of
weather
which
formerly
were
the
main
cause
of
wear
and
tear
can
scarcely
be
so
severe
but
on
the
other
hand
the
physical
strain
to
officers
and
men
and
the
difficulty
of
supply
will
be
far
greater
so
long
at
least
as
coal
is
the
chief
fuel
the
wind
no
longer
sets
a
measure
on
the
enemy
movements
vigilance
close
and
unremitting
beyond
all
our
predecessors
knew
is
the
portion
of
the
blockaders
to
prevent
surprise
furthermore
in
the
old
days
surprise
meant
at
worst
the
enemy
escape
now
it
may
mean
our
own
destruction
by
mine
or
torpedo
it
is
unnecessary
to
labour
the
point
it
is
too
obvious
that
a
close
blockade
of
the
old
type
exhibits
under
present
conditions
the
defects
of
arrested
offence
in
so
high
a
degree
as
practically
to
prohibit
its
use
what
then
can
be
done
must
we
rest
content
in
all
situations
with
system
which
riper
experience
condemned
for
cases
of
extreme
necessity
can
not
the
old
close
blockade
be
given
a
modern
form
assuredly
it
can
in
old
days
the
shoreward
limit
of
the
blockading
fleet
was
just
beyond
the
range
of
the
coast
batteries
and
this
position
it
held
continuously
by
means
of
an
inshore
squadron
in
these
days
of
mobile
defence
that
limit
is
by
analogy
the
night
range
of
destroyers
and
the
day
range
of
submarines
that
is
half
the
distance
they
can
traverse
between
dark
and
dawn
or
dawn
and
dark
respectively
unless
within
that
limit
a
base
can
be
established
a
blockade
of
this
nature
will
correspond
in
principle
to
a
close
blockade
of
the
old
type
nor
in
practice
as
was
proved
in
the
japanese
blockade
of
port
arthur
will
its
incidents
be
materially
different
the
distance
at
which
the
must
keep
will
seem
at
first
sight
to
deny
it
certainty
of
immediate
contact
the
essence
of
close
blockade
but
in
truth
other
new
factors
already
noticed
will
reduce
that
distance
relatively
quicker
and
more
certain
means
of
communication
between
the
admiral
and
his
scouts
the
absolute
freedom
of
movement
and
the
power
of
delaying
the
enemy
actual
exit
by
mining
may
go
far
to
bring
things
back
to
their
old
relations
at
port
arthur
they
did
so
entirely
if
then
as
in
that
case
our
paramount
object
is
to
keep
the
enemy
in
there
seems
still
no
reason
why
we
should
not
make
our
dispositions
on
the
principle
of
close
blockade
distances
will
be
greater
but
that
is
all
nor
must
it
be
forgotten
that
for
a
squadron
to
take
station
off
a
port
in
the
old
manner
is
not
the
only
means
of
close
blockade
it
may
still
effect
its
purpose
at
least
temporarily
by
supporting
mining
vessels
or
block
ships
sinkers
as
they
used
to
be
called
the
latter
expedient
it
is
true
had
little
success
in
the
latest
experiments
but
even
in
the
war
its
possibilities
were
by
no
means
exhausted
we
have
therefore
to
conclude
that
where
the
strategical
conditions
call
obviously
for
close
blockade
our
plan
of
operations
will
be
modified
in
that
direction
with
the
means
still
at
our
disposal
if
however
our
object
is
not
so
sharply
defined
if
in
spite
of
our
desire
to
deny
the
enemy
the
sea
we
are
ready
to
take
risks
in
order
to
bring
about
a
decision
the
case
is
not
so
clear
it
will
be
observed
that
the
looseness
which
the
new
conditions
force
upon
close
as
they
are
in
intensity
year
by
tend
more
and
more
to
approximate
it
in
practice
to
open
blockade
the
question
will
therefore
present
itself
whether
it
would
not
be
more
in
accordance
with
the
fundamental
elements
of
strength
to
adopt
open
blockade
frankly
for
all
purposes
we
should
thus
substitute
a
true
defensive
disposition
for
an
arrested
offence
and
theoretically
that
in
itself
is
a
great
advantage
the
practical
benefits
whatever
the
correlative
drawbacks
are
equally
clear
nor
are
they
less
great
now
than
they
appeared
to
howe
and
kempenfelt
we
avoid
exhaustion
of
machinery
coal
and
men
and
this
at
least
for
the
necessary
flotilla
screen
will
be
greater
than
anything
that
had
to
be
faced
in
former
days
we
have
at
least
the
opportunity
of
occupying
a
position
secure
from
surprise
and
of
keeping
the
fleet
continually
up
to
its
highest
striking
energy
finally
assuming
the
geographical
conditions
give
reasonable
promise
of
contact
a
quick
decision
which
modern
war
demands
with
ever
greater
insistence
is
more
probable
in
such
a
disposition
of
course
contact
can
rarely
be
made
certain
the
enemy
whom
the
hypothesis
of
blockade
assumes
to
be
anxious
to
avoid
action
will
always
have
a
chance
of
evasion
but
this
will
always
be
so
even
with
the
closest
blockade
now
possible
we
may
even
go
further
and
claim
for
open
blockade
that
in
favourable
conditions
it
may
give
the
better
chance
of
contact
for
by
adopting
the
principle
of
open
blockade
we
shall
have
in
accordance
with
the
theory
of
defence
the
further
advantages
of
being
able
the
better
to
conceal
our
dispositions
and
consequently
to
lay
traps
for
our
enemy
such
as
that
which
nelson
prepared
for
villeneuve
in
the
gulf
of
lyons
in
the
objection
to
such
a
course
which
appears
to
have
the
most
weight
with
current
opinion
is
the
moral
one
which
is
inseparable
from
all
deliberate
choices
of
the
defensive
if
the
watching
fleet
remains
in
a
home
fortified
base
it
may
be
assumed
that
the
usual
moral
degradation
will
set
in
but
the
method
does
not
entail
the
inglorious
security
of
such
a
base
a
sound
position
may
well
be
found
at
a
spot
such
as
admiral
togo
occupied
while
waiting
for
the
baltic
fleet
and
in
that
case
there
was
no
observable
degradation
of
any
kind
nor
is
there
much
evidence
that
this
objection
weighed
materially
with
the
opponents
of
howe
view
their
objection
was
of
a
purely
physical
kind
open
blockade
left
the
enemy
too
much
freedom
to
raid
our
trade
routes
the
watching
system
might
be
sufficient
to
keep
an
unwilling
in
port
or
to
bring
a
more
adventurous
one
to
action
but
it
could
not
control
raiding
squadrons
this
was
certainly
barham
objection
if
he
wrote
to
pitt
in
the
french
should
have
any
intention
of
sending
their
fleet
to
sea
with
this
easterly
wind
and
lord
howe
continues
at
torbay
our
mediterranean
and
jamaica
convoys
are
in
a
very
critical
situation
both
fleets
must
by
this
time
be
drawing
near
the
channel
and
can
not
enter
it
while
the
easterly
wind
holds
this
danger
must
always
be
with
us
especially
in
narrow
waters
such
as
the
north
sea
in
more
open
theatres
the
difficulty
is
not
so
obtrusive
for
with
sufficient
sea
room
trade
may
take
naturally
or
by
direction
a
course
which
our
watching
dispositions
will
cover
thus
with
nelson
in
the
case
of
toulon
his
normal
positions
on
the
sardinian
coast
covered
effectually
the
flow
of
our
trade
to
the
levant
and
the
two
sicilies
which
was
all
there
was
at
the
time
the
truth
is
that
in
endeavouring
to
decide
between
open
and
close
blockade
we
find
ourselves
confronted
with
those
special
difficulties
which
so
sharply
distinguish
naval
warfare
from
warfare
on
land
we
can
not
choose
on
purely
naval
considerations
in
naval
warfare
however
great
may
be
our
desire
to
concentrate
our
effort
on
the
enemy
main
forces
the
ulterior
object
will
always
obtrude
itself
we
must
from
the
first
do
our
best
to
control
sea
communications
and
since
those
communications
are
usually
common
we
can
not
refrain
from
occupying
those
of
the
enemy
without
at
the
same
time
neglecting
and
exposing
our
own
thus
in
the
case
of
brest
a
close
blockade
was
always
desirable
and
especially
at
convoy
seasons
because
the
great
trade
routes
which
passed
within
striking
distance
of
the
port
were
all
common
whereas
in
the
region
of
toulon
the
main
lines
were
not
common
except
along
the
coasts
of
africa
and
southern
italy
and
these
nelson
open
blockade
amply
secured
the
general
conclusion
then
is
that
however
high
may
be
the
purely
naval
and
strategical
reasons
for
adopting
open
blockade
as
the
best
means
of
securing
a
decision
against
the
enemy
fleet
yet
the
inevitable
intrusion
of
the
ulterior
object
in
the
form
of
trade
protection
or
the
security
of
military
expeditions
will
seldom
leave
us
entirely
free
to
use
the
open
method
we
must
be
prepared
in
fact
to
find
ourselves
at
least
at
times
faced
with
the
necessity
of
using
a
form
of
blockade
as
nearly
modelled
on
the
old
close
blockade
as
changed
conditions
will
permit
chapter
three
methods
of
disputing
command
i
defensive
fleet
operations
a
fleet
in
being
in
dealing
with
the
theory
of
sea
command
attention
was
called
to
the
error
of
assuming
that
if
we
are
unable
to
win
the
command
we
therefore
lose
it
it
was
pointed
out
that
this
proposition
which
is
too
often
implied
in
strategical
discussion
denies
in
effect
that
there
can
be
such
a
thing
as
strategical
defensive
at
sea
and
ignores
the
fact
that
the
normal
condition
in
war
is
for
the
command
to
be
in
dispute
theory
and
history
are
at
one
on
the
point
together
they
affirm
that
a
power
too
weak
to
win
command
by
offensive
operations
may
yet
succeed
in
holding
the
command
in
dispute
by
assuming
a
general
defensive
attitude
that
such
an
attitude
in
itself
can
not
lead
to
any
positive
result
at
sea
goes
without
saying
but
nevertheless
even
over
prolonged
periods
it
can
prevent
an
enemy
securing
positive
results
and
so
give
time
for
the
other
belligerent
to
dominate
the
situation
by
securing
his
ends
ashore
it
is
seldom
that
we
have
been
forced
even
for
a
time
to
adopt
such
an
attitude
but
our
enemies
have
done
so
frequently
to
our
serious
annoyance
and
loss
in
the
seven
years
war
for
instance
the
french
by
avoiding
offensive
operations
likely
to
lead
to
a
decision
and
confining
themselves
to
active
defence
were
able
for
five
campaigns
to
prevent
our
reducing
canada
which
was
the
object
of
the
war
had
they
staked
the
issue
on
a
great
fleet
action
in
the
first
campaign
and
had
the
result
been
against
them
we
could
certainly
have
achieved
our
object
in
half
the
time
in
the
end
of
course
they
failed
to
prevent
the
conquest
but
during
all
the
time
the
catastrophe
was
postponed
france
had
abundant
opportunity
of
gaining
offensively
elsewhere
territory
which
as
she
at
all
events
believed
would
have
compelled
us
to
give
up
our
conquest
at
the
peace
again
in
our
last
great
naval
war
napoleon
by
avoiding
general
actions
was
able
to
keep
the
command
in
dispute
till
by
alliances
and
otherwise
he
had
gathered
force
which
he
deemed
sufficient
to
warrant
a
return
to
the
offensive
eventually
that
force
proved
unequal
to
the
task
yet
when
it
failed
and
the
command
passed
to
his
enemy
he
had
had
time
to
consolidate
his
power
so
far
that
the
loss
of
his
fleet
seemed
scarcely
to
affect
it
and
for
nine
years
more
he
was
able
to
continue
the
struggle
such
examples
and
there
are
many
of
them
serve
to
show
how
serious
a
matter
is
naval
defence
in
the
hands
of
a
great
military
power
with
other
means
of
offence
they
tell
us
how
difficult
it
is
to
deal
with
and
how
serious
therefore
for
even
the
strongest
naval
power
is
the
need
to
give
it
careful
study
and
not
for
this
reason
only
but
also
because
the
strongest
naval
power
if
faced
with
a
coalition
may
find
it
impossible
to
exert
a
drastic
offensive
anywhere
without
temporarily
reducing
its
force
in
certain
areas
to
a
point
relatively
so
low
as
to
permit
of
nothing
higher
than
the
defensive
the
leading
case
of
such
a
state
of
affairs
which
we
must
further
consider
presently
was
our
own
position
in
the
war
of
american
independence
when
as
we
have
seen
in
order
to
secure
an
adequate
concentration
for
offence
in
the
west
indies
we
were
forced
to
reduce
our
home
fleet
to
defensive
level
what
then
do
we
mean
by
naval
defence
to
arrive
at
a
right
answer
we
must
first
clear
our
mind
of
all
confusing
shadows
cast
by
the
accidents
of
land
defence
both
on
land
and
at
sea
defence
means
of
course
taking
certain
measures
to
defer
a
decision
until
military
or
political
developments
so
far
redress
the
balance
of
strength
that
we
are
able
to
pass
to
the
offensive
in
the
operations
of
armies
the
most
usual
means
employed
are
the
holding
of
positions
and
forcing
our
superior
enemy
to
exhaust
his
strength
in
attacking
them
consequently
the
idea
of
military
defence
is
dominated
by
the
conception
of
entrenched
positions
and
fortresses
in
naval
warfare
this
is
not
so
at
sea
the
main
conception
is
avoiding
decisive
action
by
strategical
or
tactical
activity
so
as
to
keep
our
fleet
in
being
till
the
situation
develops
in
our
favour
in
the
golden
age
of
our
navy
the
keynote
of
naval
defence
was
mobility
not
rest
the
idea
was
to
dispute
the
control
by
harassing
operations
to
exercise
control
at
any
place
or
at
any
moment
as
we
saw
a
chance
and
to
prevent
the
enemy
exercising
control
in
spite
of
his
superiority
by
continually
occupying
his
attention
the
idea
of
mere
resistance
was
hardly
present
at
all
everything
was
counterattack
whether
upon
the
enemy
force
or
his
maritime
communications
on
land
of
course
such
methods
of
defence
are
also
well
known
but
they
belong
much
more
to
guerilla
warfare
than
to
regular
operations
in
regular
warfare
with
standing
armies
however
brilliantly
harassing
operations
and
are
used
the
fundamental
conception
is
the
defended
or
defensible
position
similarly
at
sea
although
the
essence
of
defence
is
mobility
and
an
untiring
aggressive
spirit
rather
than
rest
and
resistance
yet
there
also
defended
and
defensible
positions
are
not
excluded
but
they
are
only
used
in
the
last
resort
a
fleet
may
retire
temporarily
into
waters
difficult
of
access
where
it
can
only
be
attacked
at
great
risk
or
into
a
fortified
base
where
it
is
practically
removed
from
the
board
and
can
not
be
attacked
at
all
by
a
fleet
alone
but
the
occasions
on
which
such
expedients
can
be
used
at
sea
are
far
rarer
than
on
land
indeed
except
for
the
most
temporary
purposes
they
can
scarcely
be
regarded
as
admissible
at
sea
however
great
their
value
on
land
the
reason
is
simple
a
fleet
withdrawing
to
such
a
position
leaves
open
to
the
enemy
the
ulterior
object
which
is
the
control
of
sea
communications
whereas
on
land
an
army
in
a
good
position
may
even
for
a
prolonged
period
cover
the
ulterior
object
which
is
usually
territory
an
army
in
position
moreover
is
always
doing
something
to
exhaust
its
opponent
and
redress
the
unfavourable
balance
but
a
fleet
in
inactivity
is
too
often
permitting
the
enemy
to
carry
on
operations
which
tend
to
exhaust
the
resources
of
its
own
country
for
a
maritime
power
then
a
naval
defensive
means
nothing
but
keeping
the
fleet
actively
in
merely
in
existence
but
in
active
and
vigorous
life
no
phrase
can
better
express
the
full
significance
of
the
idea
than
a
fleet
in
being
if
it
be
rightly
understood
unfortunately
it
has
come
to
be
restricted
by
a
misunderstanding
of
the
circumstances
in
which
it
was
first
invented
to
one
special
class
of
defence
we
speak
of
it
as
though
it
were
essentially
a
method
of
defence
against
invasion
and
so
miss
its
fuller
meaning
if
however
it
be
extended
to
express
defence
against
any
kind
of
maritime
attack
whether
against
territory
or
sea
communications
its
broad
truth
will
become
apparent
and
it
will
give
us
the
true
conception
of
the
idea
as
held
in
the
british
service
the
occasion
on
which
it
was
first
used
was
one
that
well
exhibits
the
special
possibilities
of
a
naval
defensive
it
was
in
the
year
when
in
alliance
with
the
dutch
we
were
at
war
with
france
and
though
really
superior
had
been
caught
in
a
situation
which
placed
us
temporarily
at
a
great
disadvantage
in
home
waters
the
french
by
a
surprising
rapidity
of
mobilisation
and
concentration
had
stolen
a
march
on
us
before
either
our
mobilisation
or
our
concentration
was
complete
king
william
with
the
best
of
the
army
was
in
ireland
dealing
with
a
french
invasion
in
support
of
james
and
a
squadron
of
seven
sail
under
sir
cloudesley
shovel
had
been
detached
into
the
irish
sea
to
guard
his
communications
another
squadron
consisting
of
sixteen
of
the
line
british
and
dutch
had
been
sent
to
gibraltar
under
admiral
killigrew
to
take
down
the
trade
and
to
keep
an
eye
on
chateaurenault
who
with
a
slightly
inferior
squadron
was
at
toulon
it
was
assumed
he
would
probably
make
a
push
for
brest
where
the
french
main
fleet
was
mobilising
under
the
comte
de
tourville
and
killigrew
had
orders
to
follow
him
if
he
got
through
the
straits
chateaurenault
did
get
through
killigrew
failed
to
bring
him
to
action
and
instead
of
following
him
immediately
he
went
into
cadiz
to
complete
his
arrangements
for
forwarding
his
convoy
and
escorting
the
one
he
was
to
bring
home
what
of
course
he
should
have
done
according
to
the
practice
of
more
experienced
times
was
to
have
left
this
work
to
a
cruiser
detachment
and
failing
contact
with
chateaurenault
should
have
closed
at
once
to
the
strategical
centre
with
his
meanwhile
the
home
fleet
which
lord
torrington
was
to
command
was
still
unformed
it
lay
in
three
divisions
at
the
downs
portsmouth
and
plymouth
while
a
considerable
part
of
the
promised
dutch
contingent
had
not
made
its
appearance
it
was
a
splendid
chance
for
the
french
to
seize
the
command
of
the
channel
before
the
concentration
could
take
place
and
to
crush
the
british
in
detail
accordingly
on
june
as
soon
as
chateaurenault
had
arrived
tourville
put
to
sea
with
some
seventy
of
the
line
the
day
before
however
torrington
having
hoisted
his
flag
in
the
downs
had
massed
his
two
main
divisions
at
portsmouth
and
by
the
time
tourville
appeared
off
the
isle
of
wight
he
had
with
later
arrivals
both
dutch
and
british
about
of
the
line
in
helen
road
not
knowing
that
the
toulon
contingent
had
joined
he
put
to
sea
intending
to
fight
but
on
discovering
the
great
superiority
of
the
french
he
decided
in
concert
with
his
council
of
war
to
act
on
the
defensive
and
before
offering
battle
to
endeavour
to
secure
a
concentration
with
killigrew
and
shovel
and
the
plymouth
division
by
getting
to
the
westward
if
he
found
this
course
impossible
without
fighting
an
action
his
plan
was
to
retire
before
tourville
even
to
the
gunfleet
where
amidst
the
shoals
of
the
thames
estuary
he
felt
he
would
have
a
good
chance
of
repelling
an
attack
with
success
there
too
he
counted
on
being
reinforced
not
only
by
the
ships
still
at
chatham
but
also
possibly
by
ships
from
the
westward
which
might
steal
along
the
coast
and
join
him
over
the
flats
by
channels
unknown
to
the
french
to
fight
as
he
was
he
considered
to
be
only
playing
the
enemy
game
if
we
are
beaten
he
said
in
communicating
his
plan
to
the
government
they
being
absolute
masters
of
the
sea
will
be
at
great
liberty
of
doing
many
things
which
they
dare
not
do
whilst
we
observe
them
and
are
in
a
possibility
of
joining
admiral
killigrew
and
our
ships
to
the
westward
it
was
a
plan
conceived
on
the
best
principles
of
defence
waiting
till
the
acquisition
of
fresh
force
justified
a
return
to
the
offensive
it
is
further
interesting
as
a
pure
case
of
naval
defence
with
no
ulterior
object
other
than
control
of
home
waters
in
the
minds
of
the
government
there
was
no
apprehension
of
any
definite
attempt
to
invade
across
the
channel
but
the
invasion
of
ireland
was
in
full
progress
and
all
nourishment
of
it
must
be
stopped
and
our
own
communications
kept
free
there
was
moreover
serious
anxiety
lest
the
french
should
extend
their
operations
to
scotland
and
there
was
killigrew
convoy
approaching
the
situation
was
one
that
obviously
could
not
be
solved
effectually
except
by
winning
a
general
command
of
the
sea
but
in
torrington
judgment
it
could
be
rendered
innocuous
by
holding
the
command
in
dispute
his
design
therefore
was
to
act
upon
the
defensive
and
prevent
the
enemy
achieving
any
positive
result
until
he
was
in
a
position
to
fight
them
with
a
fair
chance
of
victory
a
temporary
defensive
he
considered
was
the
only
way
to
win
the
command
while
to
hazard
a
decision
in
inferior
strength
was
the
best
way
to
lose
it
nothing
could
be
in
closer
harmony
with
the
principles
of
good
strategy
as
we
understand
them
now
it
was
undoubtedly
in
advance
of
anything
that
had
been
done
up
to
that
time
and
it
was
little
wonder
if
the
government
as
is
usually
said
failed
to
appreciate
the
design
their
rejection
of
it
has
come
in
for
very
severe
criticism
but
it
would
seem
that
they
misunderstood
rather
than
failed
to
appreciate
the
earl
of
nottingham
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
government
believed
as
his
reply
to
the
admiral
clearly
shows
that
torrington
meant
to
retire
to
the
gunfleet
at
once
whereas
it
is
equally
clear
to
us
that
the
gunfleet
was
to
be
his
extreme
point
and
that
he
did
not
mean
to
retire
so
far
unless
the
french
forced
him
the
minister
failed
as
others
have
done
since
to
grasp
what
the
admiral
meant
by
a
fleet
in
being
he
thought
that
in
torrington
view
a
fleet
safe
in
port
and
not
in
contact
with
the
enemy
was
in
being
whereas
torrington
had
no
such
idea
as
nottingham
conceived
the
intention
he
saw
that
although
it
might
preserve
the
fleet
it
would
expose
everything
else
to
destruction
that
is
he
was
oppressed
with
the
special
characteristic
of
naval
warfare
which
always
permits
action
against
the
ulterior
object
when
the
enemy
denies
you
any
chance
of
acting
against
his
armed
force
under
this
misapprehension
which
indeed
was
not
justified
by
the
words
of
torrington
despatch
he
procured
from
the
queen
an
order
in
these
terms
we
apprehend
it
ran
the
consequences
of
your
retiring
to
the
gunfleet
to
be
so
fatal
that
we
choose
rather
you
should
upon
any
advantage
of
the
wind
give
battle
to
the
enemy
than
retreat
farther
than
is
necessary
to
get
an
advantage
upon
the
enemy
it
was
however
left
to
his
discretion
to
proceed
to
the
westward
to
complete
his
concentration
that
way
provided
it
said
you
by
no
means
ever
lose
sight
of
the
french
fleet
whereby
they
may
have
opportunity
of
making
attempts
upon
the
shore
or
in
the
rivers
of
medway
or
thames
or
get
away
without
fighting
this
order
has
been
very
hardly
dealt
with
by
modern
critics
although
it
clearly
contemplates
true
preventive
observation
and
even
as
the
last
words
suggest
the
idea
contained
in
nelson
saying
that
by
the
time
the
enemy
had
beat
our
fleet
soundly
they
would
do
us
no
more
harm
this
year
it
is
true
that
nelson
could
rely
on
the
proved
superiority
of
the
british
at
that
time
unit
for
unit
but
it
is
also
true
that
nottingham
and
his
colleagues
in
the
government
had
information
which
led
them
greatly
to
underestimate
tourville
strength
this
was
evident
on
the
face
of
nottingham
despatch
which
covered
the
order
so
evident
indeed
that
torrington
might
well
perhaps
have
suspended
the
execution
of
an
order
so
obviously
based
on
incorrect
information
but
knowing
probably
what
intrigues
were
going
on
against
him
at
court
he
chose
to
regard
it
as
a
peremptory
command
to
engage
whenever
he
found
himself
to
windward
much
as
a
more
scientific
view
of
naval
strategy
may
admire
conception
there
seems
no
reason
for
losing
temper
over
the
plan
it
was
certainly
one
way
of
solving
the
problem
and
seeing
how
large
were
our
reserves
a
defeat
need
not
have
meant
disaster
still
it
was
doubtless
dictated
by
an
inability
to
grasp
the
strategical
strength
of
torrington
novel
plan
a
plan
which
was
not
only
safer
but
was
calculated
to
achieve
greater
positive
results
in
the
end
the
real
fallacy
of
the
government
plan
was
that
although
it
had
a
specious
appearance
of
a
bold
offensive
it
could
have
achieved
nothing
but
a
negative
result
the
most
a
battle
could
have
given
in
the
circumstances
could
only
have
left
the
command
in
dispute
and
the
worst
would
have
given
the
enemy
a
positive
result
which
must
have
gravely
compromised

in
ireland
on
these
lines
torrington
replied
to
the
government
dealing
with
their
anxiety
for
the
ships
to
the
westward
and
the
mediterranean
convoy
whose
danger
was
their
expressed
reason
for
forbidding
him
the
gunfleet
he
pointed
out
that
they
could
not
run
much
hazard
if
they
took
care
of
themselves
for
as
he
repeated
while
we
observe
the
french
they
can
not
make
any
attempt
on
ships
or
shore
without
running
great
hazard
and
if
we
are
beaten
all
is
exposed
to
their
mercy
thus
without
specially
noticing
the
minister
misinterpretation
of
his
despatch
he
intimated
that
his
intention
was
observation
and
not
simple
retreat
by
the
time
torrington
sent
this
reply
he
had
been
pressed
back
as
far
as
beachy
head
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
get
to
the
westward
and
the
following
day
finding
himself
to
windward
he
attacked
but
still
confirmed
in
his
idea
of
defence
and
carrying
it
on
to
his
tactics
he
refused
to
give
the
french
the
chance
of
a
real
decision
and
disengaged
as
soon
as
a
drop
in
the
wind
permitted
so
far
he
felt
justified
in
interpreting
orders
which
he
knew
were
founded
on
false
information
he
was
sure
as
he
said
in
justification
of
the
way
he
fought
the
action
that
the
queen
could
not
have
been
prevailed
with
to
sign
an
order
for
it
had
not
both
our
weakness
and
the
strength
of
the
enemy
been
disguised
to
her
so
severely
was
his
fleet
crippled
that
he
believed
his
plan
could
no
longer
act
what
the
consequences
of
this
unfortunate
battle
may
be
he
wrote
in
his
journal
god
almighty
only
knows
but
this
i
dare
be
positive
in
had
i
been
left
to
my
liberty
i
had
prevented
any
attempt
upon
the
land
and
secured
the
western
ships
killigrew
and
the
merchantmen
actually
in
all
this
he
was
successful
slowly
retiring
eastward
he
drew
the
french
after
him
as
far
as
dover
before
he
ran
to
the
nore
and
tourville
was
unable
to
get
back
to
the
westward
till
all
the
endangered
ships
were
safe
in
plymouth
in
spite
of
torrington
being
forced
to
fight
an
action
at
the
wrong
time
and
place
his
design
had
so
far
succeeded
not
only
had
he
prevented
the
french
doing
anything
that
could
affect
the
issue
of
the
war
but
he
had
completely
foiled
tourville
plan
of
destroying
the
british
fleet
in
detail
that
he
had
done
but
retribution
by
passing
to
the
offensive
was
no
longer
in
his
power
that
tourville
or
his
government
was
impressed
with
the
efficacy
of
the
method
was
demonstrated
the
following
year
when
he
in
his
turn
found
himself
in
an
inferiority
that
denied
him
hope
of
a
successful
battle
decision
during
the
summer
he
kept
his
fleet
hovering
off
the
mouth
of
the
channel
without
giving
the
british
admiral
a
chance
of
contact
his
method
however
differed
from
that
of
torrington
and
he
only
achieved
his
negative
object
by
keeping
out
of
sight
of
his
enemy
altogether
in
his
opinion
if
a
fleet
remained
at
sea
in
close
observation
of
an
active
enemy
an
action
could
not
be
avoided
if
the
admiral
he
wrote
in
his
memorandum
on
the
subject
be
ordered
to
keep
the
sea
to
try
to
amuse
the
enemy
and
to
let
them
know
we
are
in
a
position
to
attack
in
case
they
attempt
a
descent
i
think
it
my
duty
to
say
that
in
that
case
we
must
make
up
our
mind
to
have
to
fight
them
in
the
end
for
if
they
have
really
sought
an
action
they
will
have
been
able
to
fight
seeing
that
it
is
impossible
to
pirouette
so
long
near
a
fleet
without
coming
to
grips
this
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
a
sure
point
of
temporary
retreat
is
necessary
to
a
fleet
in
being
and
this
was
an
essential
part
of
torrington
idea
delarbre

note
in
torrington
and

time
when

tactics
in

the
difficulty
of
avoiding
action
when
a
determined
enemy
had

were
undoubtedly
great
unless

of
retreat
was
kept
open
but
as
the
art
of
naval
warfare
developed
the
possibilities
of
a
fleet
in
being
were
regarded
as
much
wider
at
least
in
the
british
service
it
was
nearly
a
hundred
years
before
we
were
again
forced
to
use
the
same
device
on
a
large
scale
and
then
it
was
believed
that
superior
speed
and
tactical
precision
were
factors
that
could
be
counted
on
to
an
almost
unlimited
extent
in
the
darkest
days
of
the
war
of
american
independence
we
have
a
memorandum
of
the
subject
by

which
not
only
gives
the
developed
idea
of
a
fleet
in
being
and
the
high
aggressive
spirit
that
is
its
essence
but
also
explains
its
value
not
merely
as
a
defensive
expedient
but
as
a
means
of
permitting
a
drastic
offensive
even
when
you
are
as
a
whole
inferior
when
you
know
the
designs
he
says
in
order
to
do
something
effectual
you
must
endeavour

be
superior

them

execute

where
if
they
succeed
they
would
most
injure
you
if
your
fleet
is
divided
as
to
be
in
all
places
inferior
to
the
enemy
they
will
have
a
fair
chance
of
succeeding
everywhere
in
their
attempts
if
a
squadron
can
not
be
formed
sufficient
to
face
the
enemy
at
home
it
would
be
more
advantageous
to
let
your
inferiority
be
still
greater
in
order
by
it
to
gain
the
superiority
elsewhere
when
inferior
to
the
enemy
and
you
have
only
a
squadron
of
observation
to
watch
and
attend
upon
their
motions
such
a
squadron
should
be
composed
of
ships
only
that
is
ships
of
the
highest
mobility
as
to
assure
it
purpose
it
must
have
the
advantage
of
the
enemy
in
sailing
else
under
certain
circumstances
it
will
be
liable
to
be
forced
to
battle
or
to
give
up
some
of
its
heavy
sailers
it
is
highly
necessary
to
have
such
a
flying
squadron
to
hang
on
the
enemy
large
fleet
as
it
will
prevent
their
dividing
into
separate
squadrons
for
intercepting
your
trade
or
spreading
their
ships
for
a
more
extensive
view
you
will
be
at
hand
to
profit
from
any
accidental
separation
or
dispersion
of
their
fleet
from
hard
gales
fogs
or
other
causes
you
may
intercept
supplies
intelligence
c
sent
to
them
in
fine
such
a
squadron
will
be
a
check
and
restraint
upon
their
motions
and
prevent
a
good
deal
of
the
mischief
they
might
otherwise
do
three
years
before
when
first
called
to
be
chief
of
the
staff
in
the
channel
he
had
emphasised
the
same
points
much
he
wrote
in
july
i
may
say
all
depends
upon
this
fleet
is
an
inferior
against
a
superior
fleet
therefore
the
greatest
skill
and
address
is
requisite
to
counteract
the
designs
of
the
enemy
to
watch
and
seize
the
favourable
opportunity
for
action
and
to
catch
the
advantage
of
making
the
effort
at
some
or
other
feeble
part
of
the
enemy
line
or
if
such
opportunities
do
offer
to
hover
near
the
enemy
keep
him
at
bay
and
prevent
his
attempting
anything
but
at
risk
and
hazard
to
command
their
attention
and
oblige
them
to
think
of
nothing
but
being
on
their
guard
against
your
attack
i
it
was
on
these
lines
the
war
was
conducted
the
west
indian
area
in
which
lay
the
enemy
principal
object
was
treated
as
the
offensive
theatre
and
the
home
waters
as
the
defensive
inferior
as
was
the
channel
fleet
to
the
home
fleet
of
the
allies
its
defensive
operations
proved
adequate
to
prevent
their
achieving
any
success
nor
was
this
all
for
kempenfelt
was
able
to
demonstrate
the
positive
side
of
his
theory
in
the
most
brilliant
and
convincing
manner
in
dealing
with
concentration
we
have
seen
how
in
command
of
such
a
flying
squadron
as
he
postulated
he
was
able
off
ushant
to
seize
a
favourable
opportunity
for
action
which
resulted
in
his
capturing
a
convoy
of
military
stores
essential
to
the
french
operations
in
the
west
indies
under
the
nose
of
de
guichen
with
an
escort
of
nearly
twice
his
force
nelson
certainly
shared
kempenfelt
views
as
to
the
possibilities
of
an
inferior
fleet
kept
actively
in
being
as
to
our
fleet
he
wrote
from
the
mediterranean
in
under
such
a
as
sir
john
jervis
nobody
has
any
fear
we
are
now
sail
of
the
line
the
combined
fleet
will
not
be
above
i
will
venture
my
life
sir
john
jervis
defeats
them
i
do
not
mean
by
a
regular
battle
but
by
the
skill
of
our
admiral
and
the
activity
and
spirit
of
our
officers
and
seamen
this
country
is
the
most
favourable
possible
for
that
skill
with
an
inferior
fleet
for
the
winds
are
so
variable
that
some
one
time
in
hours
you
must
be
able
to
attack
a
part
of
a
large
fleet
and
the
other
will
be
becalmed
or
have
a
contrary
wind
therefore
i
hope
the
government
will
not
be
alarmed
for
our
safety
such
a
conception
of
the
defensive
may
indeed
be
said
to
have
become
current
in
the
british
service
it
was
part
of
the
reasoning
which
in
after
villeneuve
escape
from
the
mediterranean
decided
sir
john
orde
to
fall
back
on
ushant
instead
of
entering
the
straits
i
dare
believe
he
wrote
lord
nelson
will
be
found
in
condition
with
his
twelve
of
the
line
and
numerous
frigates
to
act
on
the
defensive
without
loss
and
even
to
hang
on
to
the
skirts
of
the
enemy
fleet
should
it
attempt
any
material
service
especially
when
encumbered
with
troops
in
all
this
consideration
of
the
potentialities
of
a
fleet
in
being
operating
defensively
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
we
are
dealing
with
its
possibilities
in
relation
to
a
general
command
of
the
sea
to
its
general
power
of
holding
such
command
in
dispute
as
torrington
used
it
its
power
of
preventing
a
particular
operation
such
as
oversea
invasion
is
another
matter
which
will
always
depend
upon
the
local
conditions
if
the
fleet
in
being
can
be
contained
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
impossible
for
it
to
reach
the
invading
line
of
passage
it
will
be
no
bar
to
invasion
in
so
far
as
torrington
fleet
was
concerned
the
french
had
they
been
so
minded
might
have
made
a
descent
say
at
portsmouth
while
torrington
was
at
the
nore
but
torrington
fleet
was
not
the
only
factor
his
retreat
forced
tourville
to
leave
behind
him
unfought
the
squadrons
of
shovel
and
killigrew
and
so
far
as
commanding
a
line
of
invasion
passage
was
concerned
tourville
was
himself
as
well
contained
as
torrington
the
conditions
of
naval
defence
against
invasion
are
in
fact
so
complex
compared
with
those
of
general
naval
defence
that
they
must
be
treated
later
as
a
special
branch
of
the
subject
the
doctrine
of
the
fleet
in
being
as
formulated
and
practised
by
torrington
and
developed
by
kempenfelt
goes
no
further
than
this
that
where
the
enemy
regards
the
general
command
of
a
sea
area
as
necessary
to
his
offensive
purposes
you
may
be
able
to
prevent
his
gaining
such
command
by
using
your
fleet
defensively
refusing
what
nelson
called
a
regular
battle
and
seizing
every
opportunity
for
a
counterstroke
to
use
it
as
it
was
used
by
the
french
in
the
case
of
tourville
famous
deterrent
cruise
where
the
whole
object
of
the
french
was
offensive
and
could
not
be
obtained
except
by
offence
is
quite
another
thing
it
is
indeed
difficult
to
understand
the
admiration
with
which
his
au
has
been
treated
in
france
he
kept
the
sea
off
the
mouth
of
the
channel
for
fifty
days
in
the
summer
of
and
for
forty
of
those
days
our
channel
fleet
was
making
no
systematic
effort
to
seek
him
out
he
had
been
sent
to
sea
in
hope
of
intercepting
our
great
smyrna
convoy
which
was
then
the
backbone
of
our
oversea
trade
russell
with
the
british
main
fleet
simply
took
positions
to
cover
its
approach
until
it
was
safe
knowing
presumably
that
tourville
must
come
to
him
if
he
wished
to
accomplish
his
purpose
when
the
convoy
was
safe
russell
proceeded
off
ushant
that
is
between
the
enemy
and
his
base
tourville
communications
were
thus
cut
his
line
of
retreat
threatened
and
he
seized
the
first
opportunity
to
elude
russell
and
to
return
into
port
beyond
taking
a
few
ships
from
one
of
the
west
india
convoys
he
accomplished
nothing
the
central
french
offensive
in
ireland
was
broken
at
the
battle
of
the
boyne
and
the
prestige
of
england
at
sea
was
restored
it
is
true
our
trade
suffered
in
the
north
sea
but
this
was
not
directly
due
to
the
concentration
which
tourville
cruise
forced
upon
us
but
rather
to
the
failure
of
the
dutch
apparently
by
a
provide
for
an
effective
blockade
of
dunkirk
to
british
eyes
it
will
seem
that
the
heresy
which
was
latent
in
tourville
instructions
was
a
seed
that
choked
all
the
finer
aspirations
of
the
french
navy
in
the
plan
of
his
cruise
may
possibly
be
defended
as
sufficiently
aggressive
since
seeing
how
unstable
was
william
new
throne
a
resounding
blow
at
british
trade
combined
with
an
expected
victory
in
ireland
might
have
been
enough
to
upset
it
but
afterwards
the
idea
was
stretched
to
occasions
it
would
not
fit
it
seems
to
have
bred
a
belief
that
where
the
object
of
the
war
plainly
depended
on
winning
a
real
command
of
the
sea
that
object
could
yet
be
attained
by
naval
defensive
operations
many
times
it
is
true
a
policy
which
had
starved
the
navy
of
france
left
no
other
course
open
to
her
seamen
and
had
they
in
their
inferiority
attempted
the
offensive
the
end
must
have
been
swifter
if
not
more
certain
in
criticising
the
maritime
history
of
france
we
must
be
careful
to
distinguish
policy
from
strategy
it
was
not
always
the
defensive
strategy
that
was
bad
but
the
policy
that
condemned
her
admirals
to
negative
operations
seeing
that
she
was
a
continental
power
with
continental
aspirations
it
was
often
a
policy
from
which
her
military
exigencies
permitted
no
escape
nevertheless
the
policy
was
twice
accursed
it
cursed
her
when
she
was
weak
and
cursed
her
when
she
was
strong
the
prolonged
use
of
the
defensive
bred
a
habit
of
mind
which
seems
to
have
rendered
her
incapable
of
striking
hard
when
she
had
the
strength
in
no
other
way
at
least
can
we
account
for
the
behaviour
of
so
a
nation
when
her
chance
of
revenge
came
in
the
war
of
american
independence
it
is
here
in
its
moral
reactions
lies
the
danger
of
the
defensive
a
danger
so
insidious
in
its
working
as
to
tempt
us
never
to
utter
the
word
yet
with
the
voice
of
torrington
kempenfelt
and
nelson
in
our
ears
it
would
be
folly
to
ignore
it
for
ourselves
and
still
more
to
ignore
the
exhausting
strain
its
use
by
our
enemy
may
impose
upon
us
it
must
be
studied
if
for
no
other
reasons
than
to
learn
how
to
break
it
down
nor
will
the
study
have
danger
if
only
we
keep
well
in
view
the
spirit
of
restless
and
vigilant
which
kempenfelt
and
nelson
regarded
as
its
essence
true
some
of
the
conditions
which
in
the
days
of
sails
made
for
opportunity
have
passed
away
but
many
still
remain
shifts
of
wind
and
calms
will
no
longer
bring
them
but
weather
thick
or
violent
can
yet
make
seamanship
nimbleness
and
cohesion
tell
as
it
always
did
and
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
it
is
still
possible
for
hard
to
make
the
activity
and
spirit
of
our
officers
and
seamen
give
the
results
which
nelson
so
confidently
expected
ii
minor
for
the
weaker
of
two
belligerents
has
always
exercised
a
certain
fascination
where
a
power
was
so
inferior
in
naval
force
that
it
could
scarcely
count
even
on
disputing
command
by
fleet
operations
there
remained
a
hope
of
reducing
the
relative
inferiority
by
putting
part
of
the
enemy
force
out
of
action
such
hopes
were
rarely
realised
in
drake
succeeded
in
stopping
the
spanish
invasion
by
such
a
on
the
cadiz
division
of
the
armada
while
it
was
still
unmobilised
in
the
dutch
achieved
a
similar
success
against
our
chatham
division
when
it
was
demobilised
and
undefended
and
thereby
probably
secured
rather
more
favourable
terms
of
peace
but
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
old
wars
present
any
case
where
the
ultimate
question
of
command
was
seriously
affected
by
a
minor
counterattack
the
advent
of
the
torpedo
however
has
given
the
idea
a
new
importance
that
can
not
be
overlooked
the
degree
of
that
importance
is
at
present
beyond
calculation
there
is
at
least
no
evidence
that
it
would
be
very
high
in
normal
conditions
and
between
ordinarily
efficient
fleets
the
comparative
success
of
the
opening
japanese
attack
on
the
port
arthur
squadron
is
the
only
case
in
point
and
where
only
one
case
exists
it
is
necessary
to
use
extreme
caution
in
estimating
its
significance
before
we
can
deduce
anything
of
permanent
value
we
must
consider
very
carefully
both
its
conditions
and
results
to
begin
with
it
was
a
new
experience
of
a
new
class
of
weapon
and
it
by
no
means
follows
that
the
success
of
a
new
expedient
will
be
repeated
with
anything
like
equal
result
it
will
not
be
irrelevant
again
to
recall
the
case
of
fireships
at
the
outset
of
the
sailing
era
in
this
device
prepared
the
way
for
a
decisive
success
against
a
fleet
in
the
open
in
the
succeeding
wars
the
new
weapon
found
a
prominent
place
in
the
organisation
of
fleets
but
its
success
was
never
repeated
against
ships
in
harbours
it
did
occasionally
produce
good
results
and
during
the
infancy
of
tactics
its
moral
and
even
material
effects
in
fleet
actions
were
frequently
demonstrated
but
as
naval
science
developed
and
the
limitations
of
the
weapon
were
more
accurately
measured
it
was
able
to
achieve
less
and
less
till
in
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
regarded
as
almost
negligible
even
its
moral
effect
was
lost
and
it
ceased
to
be
considered
as
a
battle
unit
now
if
we
examine
closely
the
port
arthur
case
we
shall
find
it
pointing
to
the
existence
of
certain
inherent
conditions
not
dissimilar
from
those
which
discredited
fireships
as
a
decisive
factor
in
war
in
spite
of
the
apparently
formidable
nature
of
a
surprise
attack
by
torpedo
the
indications
from
the
one
case
in
point
are
that
these
conditions
make
for
greater
power
in
the
defence
than
in
the
attack
the
first
condition
relates
to
the
difficulty
of
locating
the
objective
accurately
it
is
obvious
that
for
this
kind
of
operation
the
most
precise
intelligence
is
essential
and
of
all
intelligence
the
most
difficult
to
obtain
in
war
is
the
distribution
of
an
enemy
fleet
from
day
to
day
the
japanese
had
fairly
certain
information
that
the
bulk
of
the
port
arthur
squadron
was
lying
in
the
outer
anchorage
but
it
had
been
constantly
moving
and
there
was
a
report
that
three
battleships
had
just
been
detached
from
it
the
report
was
false
but
the
result
was
that
of
the
five
divisions
of
destroyers
which
the
japanese
had
available
two
were
diverted
against
dalny
where
no
enemy
was
found
such
uncertainty
must
always
exist
and
in
no
circumstances
is
it
likely
to
be
less
than
where
as
in
the
japanese
case
the
attack
is
made
before
declaration
and
while
the
ordinary
channels
of
intelligence
are
still
open
further
it
is
to
be
noted
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
relations
for
some
weeks
had
been
highly
strained
and
a
surprise
torpedo
attack
was
regarded
as
probable
the
russians
had
taken
no
precautions
to
confuse
their
enemy
it
is
obvious
that
measures
to
prevent
accurate
locating
can
and
should
be
taken
in
such
cases
we
may
go
further
from
confusing
the
enemy
by
such
means
it
is
but
a
step
to
lead
him
to
a
wrong
conclusion
and
to
lay
for
him
a
trap
which
may
swallow
up
the
bulk
of
his
destroyer
force
in
the
first
hours
of
the
war
it
is
to
be
feared
however
that
the
risks
of
such
an
eventuality
are
so
great
in
minor
of
this
nature
that
it
will
probably
be
very
difficult
to
tempt
an
inferior
enemy
to
expose
his
flotilla
in
this
way
this
view
receives
emphasis
from
the
second
point
which
the
port
arthur
case
serves
to
demonstrate
and
that
is
the
great
power
of
even
the
flimsiest
defence
against
such
attacks
in
other
words
the
chances
of
success
can
scarcely
ever
be
great
enough
to
justify
the
risk
everything
was
in
favour
of
the
japanese
orders
had
been
issued
in
the
russian
squadron
for
two
or
three
nights
previously
to
prepare
for
a
torpedo
attack
but
so
low
had
discipline
fallen
that
the
orders
were
obeyed
in
a
very
perfunctory
manner
guns
were
not
loaded
their
crews
were
not
at
quarters
nor
were
the
nets
got
out
the
only
real
precaution
taken
was
that
two
destroyers
and
no
more
had
been
sent
out
as
guard
patrol
but
even
they
were
forbidden
to
fire
on
anything
they
met
until
they
had
reported
to
the
admiral
or
had
themselves
been
fired
on
defence
against
a
surprise
attack
could
scarcely
have
been
more
feeble
and
yet
so
high
was
the
nervous
tension
in
the
attacking
force
that
it
proved
stronger
than
could
reasonably
have
been
expected
the
mere
existence
of
the
patrol
and
the
necessity
of
evading
it
threw
the
japanese
approach
into
a
confusion
from
which
it
was
unable
to
recover
entirely
and
the
attack
lost
its
essential
momentum
and
cohesion
again
defective
as
were
the
arrangements
in
the
squadron
itself
and
lax
as
were
its
training
and
discipline
no
torpedo
hits
were
made
so
far
as
we
can
judge
after
the
russian
guns
and
searchlights
got
into
play
such
development
of
strength
in
the
defence
seems
inherent
in
the
conditions
of
minor
attack
and
there
appears
to
be
no
reason
for
expecting
better
results
for
such
attacks
in
normal
cases
but
in
deducing
principles
from
the
port
arthur
case
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
it
was
far
from
normal
it
was
a
blow
before
declaration
when
the
menace
of
strained
relations
though
realised
had
been
almost
entirely
ignored
by
the
russians
in
such
exceptional
and
almost
incredible
circumstances
a
minor
attack
might
always
be
counted
on
for
a
certain
measure
of
success
to
this
we
have
to
add
the
fact
that
the
russian
squadron
was
not
ordinarily
efficient
but
appears
to
have
fallen
into
a
lax
condition
such
as
could
scarcely
recur
in
the
case
of
any
other
naval
power
finally
we
must
ask
what
with
every
condition
abnormally
in
favour
of
the
attack
was
the
actual
material
result
did
it
have
any
real
influence
on
the
ultimate
question
of
command
it
is
true
that
it
so
far
swung
the
balance
in
favour
of
the
japanese
that
they
were
able
to
exercise
the
local
control
long
enough
to
land
their
troops
and
isolate
port
arthur
but
the
japanese
plan
for
securing
ultimate
command
rested
on
their
power
of
taking
port
arthur
by
military
operation
and
sustaining
the
siege
from
the
sea
yet
in
spite
of
every
condition
of
success
the
physical
effect
of
the
blow
was
so
small
that
even
without
the
help
of
an
adequate
dockyard
the
squadron
recovered
from
it
and
became
potent
again
before
the
siege
could
even
be
formed
the
minor
attacks
which
followed
the
first
blow
were
all
failures
and
whether
delivered
at
the
port
or
upon
the
squadron
in
the
open
had
no
appreciable
effect
whatever
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
remembered
that
since
that
war
the
art
of
torpedo
warfare
has
developed
very
rapidly
its
range
and
offensive
power
have
increased
in
a
higher
ratio
than
the
means
of
resisting
it
still
those
means
have
advanced
and
it
is
probable
that
a
squadron
in
a
naval
port
or
in
a
properly
defended
anchorage
is
not
more
easy
to
injure
than
it
ever
was
while
a
squadron
at
sea
so
long
as
it
constantly
shifts
its
position
still
remains
very
difficult
to
locate
with
sufficient
precision
for
successful
minor
attack
the
unproved
value
of
submarines
only
deepens
the
mist
which
overhangs
the
next
naval
war
from
a
strategical
point
of
view
we
can
say
no
more
than
that
we
have
to
count
with
a
new
factor
which
gives
a
new
possibility
to
minor
counterattack
it
is
a
possibility
which
on
the
whole
tells
in
favour
of
naval
defence
a
new
card
which
skilfully
played
in
combination
with
defensive
fleet
operations
may
lend
fresh
importance
to
the
fleet
in
being
it
may
further
be
expected
that
whatever
the
effective
possibilities
of
minor
operations
may
ultimately
prove
to
be
in
regard
to
securing
command
the
moral
influence
will
be
considerable
and
at
least
at
the
beginning
of
a
future
war
will
tend
to
deflect
and
hamper
the
major
operations
and
rob
of
their
precision
the
lines
which
formerly
led
so
frankly
to
the
issue
by
battle
in
the
absence
of
a
sufficient
volume
of
experience
it
would
be
idle
to
go
further
particularly
as
torpedo
attack
like
fireship
attack
depends
for
success
more
than
any
other
on
the
spirit
and
skill
of
officers
and
men
with
regard
to
the
torpedo
as
the
typical
arm
of
mobile
coastal
defence
it
is
a
different
matter
what
has
been
said
applies
only
to
its
power
towards
securing
command
of
the
sea
and
not
to
the
exercise
or
to
disputing
the
exercise
of
command
this
is
a
question
which
is
concerned
with
defence
against
invasion
and
to
that
we
must
now
turn
chapter
four
methods
of
exercising
command
defence
against
invasion
in
methods
of
exercising
command
are
included
all
operations
not
directly
concerned
with
securing
command
or
with
preventing
its
being
secured
by
the
enemy
we
engage
in
exercising
command
whenever
we
conduct
operations
which
are
directed
not
against
the
enemy
but
to
using
sea
communications
for
our
own
purposes
or
to
interfering
with
the
enemy
use
of
them
such
operations
though
logically
of
secondary
importance
have
always
occupied
the
larger
part
of
naval
warfare
naval
warfare
does
not
begin
and
end
with
the
destruction
of
the
enemy
nor
even
with
breaking
his
cruiser
power
beyond
all
this
there
is
the
actual
work
of
preventing
his
passing
an
army
across
the
sea
and
of
protecting
the
passage
of
our
own
military
expeditions
there
is
also
the
obstruction
of
his
trade
and
the
protection
of
our
own
in
all
such
operations
we
are
concerned
with
the
exercise
of
command
we
are
using
the
sea
or
interfering
with
its
use
by
the
enemy
we
are
not
endeavouring
to
secure
the
use
or
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
securing
it
the
two
categories
of
operation
differ
radically
in
conception
and
purpose
and
strategically
they
are
on
wholly
different
planes
logically
of
course
operations
for
exercising
command
should
follow
those
for
securing
command
that
is
to
say
that
since
the
attainment
of
command
is
the
special
object
of
naval
warfare
and
since
that
command
can
only
be
obtained
permanently
by
the
destruction
of
the
enemy
armed
forces
afloat
it
follows
that
in
strictness
no
other
objects
should
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
our
concentration
of
effort
on
the
supreme
end
of
securing
command
by
destruction
war
however
is
not
conducted
by
logic
and
the
order
of
proceeding
which
logic
prescribes
can
not
always
be
adhered
to
in
practice
we
have
seen
how
owing
to
the
special
conditions
of
naval
warfare
extraneous
necessities
intrude
themselves
which
make
it
inevitable
that
operations
for
exercising
command
should
accompany
as
well
as
follow
operations
for
securing
command
war
being
as
it
is
a
complex
sum
of
naval
military
political
financial
and
moral
factors
its
actuality
can
seldom
offer
to
a
naval
staff
a
clean
slate
on
which
strategical
problems
can
be
solved
by
syllogisms
the
naval
factor
can
never
ignore
the
others
from
the
outset
one
or
more
of
them
will
always
call
for
some
act
of
exercising
command
which
will
not
wait
for
its
turn
in
the
logical
progression
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
in
all
ordinary
cases
both
categories
of
operation
will
have
to
be
put
in
motion
from
the
beginning
hence
the
importance
of
realising
the
distinction
between
the
two
generic
forms
of
naval
activity
in
the
hurry
and
stress
of
war
confusion
between
them
is
easy
by
keeping
a
firm
grip
upon
the
difference
we
can
see
at
least
what
we
are
doing
we
can
judge
how
far
any
given
operation
that
may
be
called
for
is
a
sacrifice
of
security
to
exercise
how
far
such
a
sacrifice
may
be
justified
and
how
far
the
one
end
may
be
made
to
serve
the
other
by
applying
the
distinction
as
a
test
much
error
may
be
avoided
the
risk
we
take
may
be
great
but
we
shall
be
able
to
weigh
it
accurately
against
the
value
of
the
end
and
we
shall
take
it
with
our
eyes
open
and
of
set
purpose
above
all
it
will
enable
the
staff
to
settle
clearly
for
each
squadronal
commander
what
is
to
be
his
primary
objective
and
what
the
object
or
purpose
of
the
operations
entrusted
to
him
it
is
above
all
in
this
last
consideration
and
particularly
in
the
determination
of
the
objective
that
lies
the
main
practical
value
of
the
distinction
this
will
become
clear
the
moment
we
begin
to
consider
defence
against
invasion
which
naturally
takes
the
first
place
amongst
operations
for
the
exercise
of
control
of
all
the
current
assumptions
not
one
is
so
confusing
for
the
finer
adjustments
of
strategy
as
that
which
affirms
that
the
primary
objective
of
our
fleet
is
always
the
enemy
fleet
of
the
and
its
attendant
units
it
is
of
course
true
so
long
at
least
as
the
enemy
has
a
in
being
it
is
true
that
is
of
all
operations
for
securing
control
but
of
operations
for
exercising
control
it
is
not
true
in
the
case
we
have
now
to
against
objective
of
the
special
operations
is
and
always
has
been
the
enemy
army
on
this
fundamental
postulate
our
plans
for
resisting
invasion
have
always
been
constructed
from
the
year
of
the
armada
to
in
the
old
service
tradition
the
point
was
perfectly
well
established
admirals
instructions
constantly
insist
on
the
fact
that
the
transports
are
the
principal
object
the
whole
disposition
of
the
fleet
during
hawke
blockade
in
was
based
on
keeping
a
firm
hold
on
the
transports
in
the
morbihan
and
when
he
sought
to
extend
his
operations
against
the
rochefort
squadron
he
was
sharply
reminded
by
anson
that
the
principal
object
of
attention
at
this
time
was
firstly
the
interception
of
the
embarkations
of
the
enemy
at
morbihan
and
secondly
the
keeping
of
the
ships
of
war
from
coming
out
of
brest
similarly
commodore
warren
in
when
he
had
the
permanent
frigate
guard
before
brest
issued
orders
to
his
captains
that
in
case
of
encountering
enemy
transports
under
escort
they
were
to
run
them
down
or
destroy
them
in
the
most
expeditious
manner
possible
previous
to
attacking
the
ships
of
war
but
to
preserve
such
a
situation
as
to
effect
that
purpose
when
directed
by
signal
lord
orders
when
watching
napoleon
flotilla
were
to
the
same
effect
directing
your
chief
attention
they
run
to
the
destruction
of
the
ships
vessels
or
boats
having
men
horses
or
artillery
on
board
in
preference
to
that
of
the
vessels
by
which
they
are
protected
and
in
the
strict
execution
of
this
important
duty
losing
sight
entirely
of
the
possibility
of
idle
censure
for
avoiding
contact
with
an
armed
force
because
the
prevention
of
debarkation
is
the
object
of
primary
importance
to
which
every
other
consideration
must
give
way
secretary
august
in
tactics
then
the
idea
was
the
same
as
in
strategy
the
army
was
the
primary
objective
round
which
all
dispositions
turned
in
the
french
service
the
strength
and
soundness
of
the
british
practice
was
understood
at
least
by
the
best
men
when
in
napoleon
consulted
ganteaume
as
to
the
possibility
of
the
flotilla
of
transports
effecting
its
passage
by
evasion
the
admiral
told
him
it
was
impossible
since
no
weather
could
avail
to
relax
the
british
hold
sufficiently
in
former
wars
he
said
the
english
vigilance
was
miraculous
to
this
rule
there
was
no
exception
not
even
when
circumstances
rendered
it
difficult
to
distinguish
between
the
enemy
fleet
and
army
as
objectives
this
situation
could
occur
in
two
ways
firstly
when
the
invading
army
was
designed
to
sail
with
the
as
in
the
case
of
napoleon
invasion
of
egypt
and
secondly
when
although
the
design
was
that
the
two
should
operate
on
separate
lines
our
system
of
defence
forced
the
fleet
to
come
up
to
the
army
line
of
passage
in
order
to
clear
it
as
happened
in
the
case
of
the
armada
and
the
french
attempt
of
in
the
latter
case
the
invading
army
whose
objective
was
unknown
was
at
dunkirk
and
a
french
fleet
was
coming
up
the
channel
to
cover
the
passage
sir
john
norris
in
command
of
the
home
fleet
was
in
the
downs
though
his
name
is
now
almost
forgotten
he
was
one
of
the
great
founders
of
our
naval
tradition
and
a
strategist
of
the
first
order
in
informing
the
government
of
his
plan
of
operations
he
said
he
intended
to
proceed
with
his
whole
squadron
off
dunkirk
to
prevent
the
transports
sailing
but
he
says
if
they
should
unfortunately
get
out
and
pass
us
in
the
night
and
go
northward
i
intend
to
detach
a
superior
force
to
endeavour
to
overtake
and
destroy
them
and
with
the
remainder
of
my
squadron
either
to
fight
the
french
fleet
now
in
the
channel
or
observe
them
and
cover
the
country
as
our
circumstances
will
admit
of
or
i
shall
pursue
the
embarkation
with
all
my
strength
in
this
case
there
had
been
no
time
to
organise
a
special
squadron
or
flotilla
in
the
usual
way
to
bar
the
line
of
passage
and
the
had
to
be
used
for
the
purpose
this
being
so
norris
was
not
going
to
allow
the
presence
of
an
enemy
to
entice
him
away
from
his
grip
on
the
invading
army
and
so
resolutely
did
he
hold
to
the
principle
that
he
meant
if
the
transports
put
to
sea
to
direct
his
offensive
against
them
while
he
merely
contained
the
enemy
by
defensive
observation
in
the
egyptian
case
there
was
no
distinction
between
the
two
objectives
at
all
napoleon
expedition
sailed
in
one
mass
yet
in
the
handling
of
his
fleet
nelson
preserved
the
essential
idea
he
organised
it
into
three
one
of
six
sail
and
two
of
four
each
two
of
these
says
berry
his
were
to
attack
the
ships
of
war
while
the
third
was
to
pursue
the
transports
and
to
sink
and
destroy
as
many
as
it
could
that
is
he
intended
in
order
to
make
sure
of
napoleon
army
to
use
no
more
than
ten
and
possibly
only
eight
of
his
own
battleships
against
the
eleven
of
the
enemy
many
other
examples
could
be
given
of
british
insistence
on
making
the
enemy
army
the
primary
objective
and
not
his
fleet
in
cases
of
invasion
no
point
in
the
old
tradition
was
more
firmly
established
its
value
was
of
course
more
strongly
marked
where
the
army
and
the
fleet
of
the
enemy
endeavoured
to
act
on
separate
lines
of
operation
that
is
where
the
army
took
the
real
offensive
line
and
the
fleet
the
covering
or
preventive
line
and
where
consequently
for
our
own
fleet
there
was
no
confusion
between
the
two
objectives
this
was
the
normal
case
and
the
reason
it
was
so
is
simple
enough
it
may
be
stated
at
once
since
it
serves
to
enunciate
the
general
principle
upon
which
our
traditional
system
of
defence
was
based
an
invasion
of
great
britain
must
always
be
an
attempt
over
an
uncommanded
sea
it
may
be
that
our
fleet
predominates
or
it
may
be
that
it
does
not
but
the
command
must
always
be
in
dispute
if
we
have
gained
complete
command
no
invasion
can
take
place
nor
will
it
be
attempted
if
we
have
lost
it
completely
no
invasion
will
be
necessary
since
quite
apart
from
the
threat
of
invasion
we
must
make
peace
on
the
best
terms
we
can
get
now
if
the
sea
be
uncommanded
there
are
obviously
two
ways
in
which
an
invasion
may
be
attempted
firstly
the
enemy
may
endeavour
to
force
it
through
our
naval
defence
with
transports
and
fleet
in
one
mass
this
was
the
primitive
idea
on
which
the
spanish
invasion
of
philip
the
second
was
originally
planned
by
his
famous
admiral
ripening
military
science
however
was
able
to
convince
him
of
its
weakness
a
mass
of
transports
and
warships
is
the
most
cumbrous
and
vulnerable
engine
of
war
ever
known
the
weaker
the
naval
defence
of
the
threatened
country
the
more
devoutly
will
it
pray
the
invader
may
use
this
device
where
contact
with
the
enemy
fleet
is
certain
and
particularly
in
narrow
seas
as
it
was
in
this
case
such
a
course
will
give
the
defender
all
the
chances
he
could
desire
and
success
for
the
invader
is
inconceivable
provided
always
we
resolutely
determine
to
make
the
army
in
its
transports
our
main
objective
and
are
not
to
be
induced
to
break
our
head
against
its
escort
where
however
contact
is
not
certain
the
invasion
over
an
uncommanded
sea
may
succeed
by
evasion
of
the
defender
as
it
did
in
the
case
of
napoleon
invasion
of
egypt
but
that
operation
belongs
to
an
entirely
different
category
from
that
which
we
are
now
considering
none
of
the
factors
on
which
the
traditional
system
of
british
defence
is
based
were
present
it
was
an
operation
over
an
open
sea
against
a
distant
and
undetermined
objective
that
had
no
naval
defence
of
its
own
whereas
in
our
own
case
the
determining
factors
are
permanent
naval
defence
an
approximately
determined
objective
and
a
narrow
sea
where
evasion
by
any
force
of
invasion
strength
is
impossible
napoleon
exploit
was
in
fact
nothing
more
than
the
evasion
of
an
open
blockade
which
had
no
naval
defence
beyond
it
the
vital
importance
of
these
things
will
appear
as
we
proceed
and
note
the
characteristics
which
marked
every
attempt
to
invade
england
from
such
attempts
we
of
course
exclude
the
various
descents
upon
ireland
which
not
being
of
invasion
strength
fall
into
another
class
to
be
dealt
with
hereafter
since
the
expedient
of
forcing
an
invasion
by
the
strength
of
a
powerful
battleship
escort
has
always
been
rejected
as
an
inadmissible
operation
the
invader
has
had
no
choice
but
to
adopt
a
separate
line
for
his
army
and
operate
with
his
fleet
in
such
a
way
as
may
promise
to
prevent
the
enemy
controlling
that
line
that
in
short
is
the
problem
of
invasion
over
an
uncommanded
sea
in
spite
of
an
unbroken
record
of
failure
scored
at
times
with
naval
disaster
continental
strategists
from
parma
to
napoleon
have
clung
obstinately
to
the
belief
that
there
is
a
solution
short
of
a
complete
fleet
decision
they
have
tried
every
conceivable
expedient
again
and
again
they
have
tried
it
by
simple
surprise
evasion
and
by
evasion
through
diversion
or
dispersal
of
our
naval
defence
they
have
tried
it
by
seeking
local
control
through
a
local
naval
success
prepared
by
surprise
or
by
attempting
to
entice
our
fleet
away
from
home
waters
to
a
sufficient
extent
to
give
them
temporarily
local
superiority
but
the
end
has
always
been
the
same
try
as
they
would
they
were
faced
ultimately
by
one
of
two
alternatives
they
must
either
defeat
our
covering
in
battle
or
they
must
close
their
own
on
the
transports
and
so
set
up
the
very
situation
which
it
was
their
main
design
to
avoid
the
truth
is
that
all
attempts
to
invade
england
without
command
of
the
sea
have
moved
in
a
vicious
circle
from
which
no
escape
was
ever
found
no
matter
how
ingenious
or
complex
the
enemy
design
a
determined
hold
on
their
army
as
the
primary
naval
objective
has
always
set
up
a
process
of
degradation
which
rendered
the
enterprise
impracticable
its
stages
are
distinct
and
recurrent
and
may
be
expressed
as
it
were
diagrammatically
as
follows
two
lines
of
operation
having
been
decided
on
the
invading
army
is
gathered
at
a
point
as
close
as
possible
to
the
coast
to
be
invaded
that
is
where
the
intervening
sea
is
narrowest
and
where
the
army
passage
will
be
exposed
to
interference
for
the
shortest
time
the
covering
fleet
will
operate
from
a
point
as
distant
as
convenient
so
as
to
entice
the
enemy
as
far
as
possible
from
the
army
line
of
passage
the
defender
replies
by
blockading
the
army
ports
of
departure
with
a
flotilla
of
light
vessels
capable
of
dealing
with
transports
or
by
establishing
a
mobile
defence
of
the
threatened
coasts
which
transports
can
not
break
unaided
or
more
probably
he
will
combine
both
expedients
the
first
fallacy
of
the
invasion
plan
is
then
apparent
the
narrower
the
sea
the
easier
it
is
to
watch
pure
evasion
becomes
impossible
and
it
is
necessary
to
give
the
transports
sufficient
armed
strength
by
escort
or
otherwise
to
protect
them
against
flotilla
attack
the
defender
at
once
stiffens
his
flotilla
defence
with
cruisers
and
intermediate
ships
and
the
invader
has
to
arrange
for
breaking
the
barrier
with
a
so
weak
and
disturbing
a
position
is
then
set
up
that
the
whole
scheme
begins
to
give
way
if
that
is
the
defender
has
clung
stubbornly
to
the
strategy
we
always
used
our
refused
to
seek
out
that
of
the
invader
it
has
always
held
a
position
between
the
invader
fleet
and
the
blockaded
invasion
base
covering
the
blockade
and
flotilla
defence
to
enable
a
to
break
our
hold
and
to
reinforce
the
army
escort
the
invader
must
either
force
this
covering
position
by
battle
or
disturb
it
so
effectively
as
to
permit
the
reinforcing
squadron
to
evade
it
but
since
he
is
trying
to
invade
without
securing
the
command
by
battle
he
will
first
try
to
reinforce
his
transport
escort
by
evasion
at
once
he
is
faced
with
new
difficulty
the
reinforcement
entails
dividing
his
fleet
and
this
is
an
expedient
so
vicious
and
disturbing
to
morale
that
no
invader
has
ever
been
found
to
risk
it
and
for
this
reason
to
make
evasion
possible
for
the
detached
squadron
he
must
bring
up
the
rest
of
his
force
and
engage
the
attention
of
the
enemy
fleet
and
thus
unless
he
is
in
very
great
superiority
and
by
hypothesis
is
not
he
runs
the
hazard
of
having
his
two
divisions
beaten
in
detail
this
method
has
sometimes
been
urged
by
governments
but
so
loud
have
been
the
protests
both
from
the
fleet
and
the
army
that
it
has
always
been
dropped
and
the
invader
finds
himself
at
the
end
of
the
vicious
circle
unable
to
reinforce
his
transport
escort
sufficiently
without
dividing
his
he
is
forced
to
bring
his
whole
force
up
to
the
army
or
abandon
the
attempt
till
command
shall
have
been
secured
by
battle
thus
the
traditional
british
system
has
never
failed
to
bring
about
the
deadlock
and
it
will
be
observed
it
is
founded
on
making
the
invading
army
the
primary
objective
we
keep
a
hold
on
it
firstly
by
flotilla
blockade
and
defence
stiffened
as
circumstances
may
dictate
by
higher
units
and
secondly
by
cover
it
is
on
the
flotilla
hold
that
the
whole
system
is
built
up
it
is
the
local
danger
to
that
hold
which
determines
the
amount
of
stiffening
the
flotilla
demands
and
it
is
the
security
of
that
hold
which
determines
the
position
and
action
of
the
a
few
typical
examples
will
serve
to
show
how
the
system
worked
in
practice
under
all
kinds
of
conditions
the
first
scientific
attempt
to
work
on
two
lines
of
operation
as
distinguished
from
the
crude
mass
methods
of
the
middle
ages
was
the
spanish
enterprise
of
though
internal
support
from
catholic
malcontents
was
expected
it
was
designed
as
a
true
invasion
that
is
a
continuing
operation
for
permanent
conquest
parma
the
military
laid
it
down
that
the
spanish
fleet
would
have
not
only
to
protect
his
passage
and
support
his
landing
but
also
to
keep
open
his
communications
for
the
flow
of
provisions
and
munition
in
advising
the
dual
line
of
operation
parma
original
intention
was
to
get
his
army
across
by
surprise
as
always
however
it
proved
impossible
to
conceal
the
design
and
long
before
he
was
ready
he
found
himself
securely
blockaded
by
a
dutch
flotilla
supported
by
an
english
squadron
so
firm
indeed
was
the
english
hold
on
the
army
that
for
a
time
it
was
overdone
the
bulk
of
the
english
fleet
was
kept
on
the
line
of
passage
under
howard
while
drake
alone
was
sent
to
the
westward
it
was
only
under
the
great
sailor
importunity
that
the
disposition
which
was
to
become
traditional
was
perfected
and
the
whole
fleet
with
the
exception
of
the
squadron
supporting
the
flotilla
blockade
was
massed
in
a
covering
position
to
the
westward
the
normal
situation
was
then
set
up
and
it
could
only
have
one
result
surprise
was
out
of
the
question
parma
could
not
move
till
the
blockade
was
broken
nor
in
face
of
the
covering
fleet
could
the
spanish
fleet
hope
to
break
it
by
a
sudden
intrusion
the
vague
prospects
the
spaniards
had
conceived
of
keeping
the
english
fleet
away
from
the
line
of
passage
by
threatening
a
descent
in
the
west
country
or
blockading
it
in
a
western
port
would
no
longer
do
no
such
expedient
would
release
parma
and
the
duke
of
was
ordered
to
proceed
direct
to
dunkirk
if
possible
without
fighting
there
to
break
the
blockade
and
secure
the
passage
there
was
some
idea
in
the
king
mind
that
he
would
be
able
to
do
this
without
a
battle
but
parma
and
every
seasoned
spanish
sailor
knew
that
the
english
fleet
would
have
to
be
totally
defeated
before
the
transports
could
venture
out
of
port
such
a
battle
was
indeed
inevitable
and
the
english
dispositions
secured
that
the
spaniards
would
have
to
fight
it
under
every
disadvantage
which
was
inherent
in
the
plan
of
dual
lines
of
operation
the
english
would
secure
certain
contact
at
such
a
distance
from
the
line
of
passage
as
would
permit
prolonged
harassing
attacks
in
waters
unfamiliar
to
the
enemy
and
close
to
their
own
sources
of
support
and
supply
no
battle
to
the
death
would
be
necessary
until
the
spaniards
were
herded
into
the
confined
and
narrow
waters
which
the
army
passage
demanded
and
where
both
sections
of
the
british
fleet
would
be
massed
for
the
final
struggle
they
must
arrive
there
dispirited
with
indecisive
actions
and
with
the
terrors
of
unknown
and
difficult
seas
at
the
highest
point
all
this
was
no
matter
of
chance
it
was
inherent
in
the
strategical
and
geographical
conditions
the
english
dispositions
had
taken
every
advantage
of
them
and
the
result
was
that
not
only
was
the
spanish
army
unable
even
to
move
but
the
english
advantages
in
the
final
battle
were
so
great
that
it
was
only
a
lucky
shift
of
wind
that
saved
the
armada
from
being
driven
to
total
destruction
upon
the
dutch
banks
in
this
case
of
course
there
had
been
ample
time
to
make
the
necessary
dispositions
it
will
be
well
to
follow
it
with
an
example
in
which
surprise
came
as
near
to
being
complete
as
it
is
possible
to
conceive
and
where
the
arrangements
for
defence
had
to
be
improvised
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
a
case
in
point
was
the
french
attempt
of
in
that
year
everything
was
in
favour
of
the
invader
england
was
undermined
with
jacobite
sedition
scotland
was
restless
and
threatening
the
navy
had
sunk
to
what
is
universally
regarded
as
its
worst
for
spirit
organisation
and
command
and
the
government
was
in
the
hands
of
the
notorious
drunken
administration
for
three
years
we
had
been
making
unsuccessful
war
with
spain
and
had
been
supporting
maria
theresa
on
the
continent
against
france
with
the
result
that
our
home
defence
was
reduced
to
its
lowest
ebb
the
navy
then
numbered
sail
about
equal
to
that
of
france
and
spain
combined
but
owing
to
the
strain
of
the
war
in
the
mediterranean
and
transatlantic
stations
only
including
eighteen
of
the
line
were
available
for
home
waters
even
counting
all
cruising
ships
within
call
as
the
phrase
then
was
the
government
had
barely
of
the
fleet
at
hand
to
meet
the
crisis
with
the
land
forces
it
was
little
better
considerably
more
than
half
the
home
army
was
abroad
with
the
king
who
was
assisting
the
as
elector
of
hanover
between
france
and
england
however
there
was
no
war
in
the
summer
the
king
won
the
battle
of
dettingen
a
formal
alliance
with
maria
theresa
followed
in
the
autumn
france
responded
with
a
secret
alliance
with
spain
and
to
prevent
further
british
action
on
the
continent
she
resolved
to
strike
a
blow
at
london
in
combination
with
a
jacobite
insurrection
it
was
to
be
a
bolt
from
the
blue
before
declaration
and
in
when
the
best
ships
of
the
home
fleet
were
laid
up
the
operation
was
planned
on
dual
lines
the
army
to
start
from
dunkirk
the
covering
fleet
from
brest
the
surprise
was
admirably
designed
the
port
of
dunkirk
had
been
destroyed
under
the
treaty
of
utrecht
in
and
though
the
french
had
been
restoring
it
secretly
for
some
time
it
was
still
unfit
to
receive
a
fleet
of
transports
in
spite
of
the
warnings
of
sir
john
norris
the
senior
admiral
in
the
service
the
assembling
of
troops
in
its
neighbourhood
from
the
french
army
in
flanders
could
only
be
taken
for
a
movement
into
winter
quarters
and
that
no
suspicion
might
be
aroused
the
necessary
transports
were
secretly
taken
up
in
other
ports
under
false
and
were
only
to
assemble
off
dunkirk
at
the
last
moment
with
equal
skill
the
purpose
of
the
naval
mobilisation
at
brest
was
concealed
by
false
information
cleverly
imparted
to
our
spies
and
by
parade
of
victualling
for
a
long
voyage
the
british
government
was
led
to
believe
that
the
main
fleet
was
intended
to
join
the
spaniards
in
the
mediterranean
while
a
detachment
which
was
designed
to
escort
the
transports
was
ostensibly
equipped
for
a
raid
in
the
west
indies
so
far
as
concealment
was
concerned
the
arrangement
was
perfect
yet
it
contained
within
it
the
fatal
ingredient
the
army
was
to
strike
in
the
thames
at
tilbury
but
complete
as
was
the
secrecy
marshal
saxe
who
was
to
command
could
not
face
the
passage
without
escort
there
were
too
many
privateers
and
armed
merchantmen
always
in
the
river
besides
cruisers
moving
to
and
fro
on
duty
the
division
therefore
which
we
supposed
to
be
for
the
west
indies
was
to
be
detached
from
the
brest
fleet
after
it
entered
the
channel
and
was
to
proceed
to
join
the
transports
off
dunkirk
while
the
marquis
de
roquefeuil
with
the
main
fleet
held
what
british
ships
might
be
ready
in
portsmouth
either
by
battle
or
blockade
nothing
could
look
simpler
or
more
certain
of
success
the
british
government
seemed
quite
asleep
the
blow
was
timed
for
the
first
week
in
january
and
it
was
before
they
even
began
to
watch
brest
with
cruisers
regularly
on
these
cruisers
reports
measures
were
taken
to
prepare
an
equal
squadron
for
sea
by
the
new
year
by
this
time
nearly
twenty
of
the
line
were
ready
or
nearly
so
at
the
nore
portsmouth
and
plymouth
and
a
press
was
ordered
to
man
them
owing
to
various
causes
the
french
had
now
to
postpone
their
venture
finally
it
was
not
till
february
that
roquefeuil
was
seen
to
leave
brest
with
nineteen
of
the
line
the
news
reached
london
on
the
and
next
day
norris
was
ordered
to
hoist
his
flag
at
spithead
his
instructions
were
to
take
the
most
effectual
measures
to
prevent
the
making
of
any
descent
upon
the
kingdoms
it
was
nothing
but
news
that
the
young
pretender
had
left
rome
for
france
that
led
to
this
precaution
the
government
had
still
no
suspicion
of
what
was
brewing
at
dunkirk
it
was
not
till
the
that
a
dover
smuggler
brought
over
information
which
at
last
opened
their
eyes
a
day
or
two
later
the
french
transports
were
seen
making
for
dunkirk
and
were
mistaken
for
the
brest
fleet
orders
were
consequently
sent
down
to
norris
to
follow
them
in
vain
he
protested
at
the
interference
he
knew
the
french
were
still
to
the
westward
of
him
but
his
orders
were
repeated
and
he
had
to
go
tiding
it
against
easterly
winds
he
reached
the
downs
and
joined
the
nore
division
there
on
the
history
usually
speaks
of
this
false
movement
as
the
happy
chance
which
saved
the
country
from
invasion
but
it
was
not
so
saxe
had
determined
not
to
face
the
thames
ships
without
escort
they
were
ample
to
destroy
him
had
he
done
so
in
truth
the
move
which
the
government
forced
on
norris
spoilt
the
campaign
and
prevented
his
destroying
the
brest
fleet
as
well
as
stopping
the
invasion
roquefeuil
had
just
received
his
final
orders
off
the
start
he
was
instructed
by
all
possible
means
to
bring
the
main
british
fleet
to
action
or
at
least
to
prevent
further
concentration
while
he
was
also
to
detach
the
special
division
of
four
of
the
line
under
admiral
barraille
to
dunkirk
to
escort
the
transports
it
was
in
fact
the
inevitable
order
caused
by
our
hold
on
the
army
to
divide
the
fleet
both
officers
as
usual
began
to
be
upset
and
as
with
they
decided
to
keep
company
till
they
reached
the
isle
of
wight
and
remain
there
till
they
could
get
touch
with
saxe
and
pilots
for
the
dover
strait
they
were
beset
with
the
nervousness
that
seems
inseparable
from
this
form
of
operation
roquefeuil
explained
to
his
government
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
ships
the
enemy
had
passed
to
the
downs
and
that
barraille
when
he
arrived
off
dunkirk
might
well
find
himself
in
inferiority
he
ended
in
the
usual
way
by
urging
that
the
whole
fleet
must
move
in
a
body
to
the
line
of
passage
on
arriving
off
portsmouth
however
a
reconnaissance
in
thick
weather
led
him
to
believe
that
the
whole
of
norris
fleet
was
still
there
and
he
therefore
detached
barraille
who
reached
dunkirk
in
safety
not
knowing
that
norris
was
in
the
downs
saxe
began
immediately
to
embark
his
troops
but
bad
weather
delayed
the
operation
for
three
days
and
so
saved
the
expedition
exposed
as
it
was
in
the
open
roads
from
destruction
by
an
attack
which
norris
was
on
the
point
of
delivering
with
his
flotilla
of
fireships
and
bomb
vessels
the
brest
squadron
had
an
equally
narrow
escape
saxe
and
his
staff
having
heard
rumours
of
norris
movement
to
the
downs
had
become
seized
with
the
which
always
seems
to
afflict
an
army
as
it
waits
to
face
the
dangers
of
an
uncommanded
passage
they
too
wanted
the
whole
fleet
to
escort
them
and
orders
had
been
sent
to
roquefeuille
to
do
as
he
had
suggested
all
unconscious
of
norris
presence
in
the
downs
with
a
score
of
the
line
more
powerful
than
his
own
he
came
on
with
the
fifteen
he
had
still
with
his
flag
to
close
on
barraille
norris
was
informed
of
his
approach
and
it
was
now
he
wrote
his
admirable
appreciation
already
quoted
for
dealing
with
the
situation
as
i
think
it
he
said
of
the
greatest
consequence
to
his
service
to
prevent
the
landing
of
these
troops
in
any
part
of
the
country
i
have
determined
to
anchor
without
the
sands
of
dunkirk
where
we
shall
be
in
the
fairest
way
for
keeping
them
in
that
is
he
determined
to
keep
hold
of
the
army
regardless
of
the
enemy
fleet
and
as
objective
was
not
quite
certain
he
would
do
it
by
close
blockade
but
if
he
continued
they
should
unfortunately
get
out
and
pass
in
the
night
and
go
northward
that
is
for
scotland
i
intend
to
detach
a
superior
force
to
endeavour
to
overtake
and
destroy
them
and
with
the
remainder
of
my
squadron
either
fight
the
french
fleet
now
in
the
channel
or
observe
them
and
cover
the
country
as
our
circumstances
will
admit
of
or
i
shall
pursue
the
embarkation
that
is
follow
the
transports
with
all
my
strength
this
meant
he
would
treat
the
enemy
army
offensively
and
their
fleet
defensively
and
his
plan
was
entirely
approved
by
the
king
as
to
which
of
the
two
plans
he
would
adopt
the
inference
is
that
his
choice
would
depend
on
the
strength
of
the
enemy
for
it
was
reported
the
rochefort
squadron
had
joined
roquefeuille
the
doubt
was
quickly
settled
on
the
morrow
he
heard
that
roquefeuille
was
at
dungeness
with
only
fifteen
of
the
line
in
a
moment
he
seized
all
the
advantage
of
the
interior
position
which
roquefeuille
necessity
to
close
on
the
army
had
given
him
with
admirable
insight
he
saw
there
was
time
to
fling
his
whole
force
at
the
enemy
fleet
without
losing
his
hold
on
the
army
line
of
passage
the
movement
was
made
immediately
the
moment
the
french
were
sighted
general
chase
was
signalled
and
roquefeuille
was
within
an
ace
of
being
surprised
at
his
anchorage
when
a
calm
stopped
the
attack
the
calm
was
succeeded
by
another
furious
gale
in
which
the
french
escaped
in
a
disastrous
qui
and
the
fleet
of
transports
was
destroyed
the
outcome
of
it
all
was
not
only
the
failure
of
the
invasion
but
that
we
secured
the
command
of
home
waters
for
the
rest
of
the
war
the
whole
attempt
it
will
be
seen
with
everything
in
its
favour
had
exhibited
the
normal
course
of
degradation
for
all
the
nicely
framed
plan
and
the
perfect
deception
the
inherent
difficulties
when
it
came
to
the
point
of
execution
had
as
usual
forced
a
clumsy
concentration
of
the
enemy
with
his
transports
and
we
on
our
part
were
able
to
forestall
it
with
every
advantage
in
our
favour
by
the
simple
expedient
of
a
central
mass
on
a
revealed
and
certain
line
of
passage
in
the
next
project
that
of
a
new
and
very
clever
plan
was
devised
for
turning
the
difficulty
the
first
idea
of
marshal
belleisle
like
that
of
napoleon
was
to
gather
the
army
at
ambleteuse
and
boulogne
and
to
avoid
the
assemblage
of
transports
by
passing
it
across
the
strait
by
stealth
in
flat
boats
but
this
idea
was
abandoned
before
it
had
gone
very
far
for
something
much
more
subtle
the
fallacious
advantage
of
a
short
passage
was
dropped
and
the
army
was
to
start
from
three
widely
separated
points
all
in
more
open
waters
a
diversionary
raid
from
dunkirk
and
two
more
formidable
forces
from
havre
and
the
morbihan
in
south
brittany
to
secure
sufficient
control
there
was
to
be
a
concentration
on
the
brest
fleet
from
the
mediterranean
and
the
west
indies
the
new
feature
it
will
be
observed
was
that
our
covering
fleet
that
is
the
western
squadron
off
brest
would
have
two
cruiser
blockades
to
secure
one
on
either
side
of
it
difficult
as
the
situation
looked
it
was
solved
on
the
old
lines
the
two
divisions
of
the
french
army
at
dunkirk
and
morbihan
were
held
by
cruiser
squadrons
capable
of
following
them
over
the
open
sea
if
by
chance
they
escaped
while
the
third
division
at
havre
which
had
nothing
but
flat
boats
for
transport
was
held
by
a
flotilla
well
supported
its
case
was
hopeless
it
could
not
move
without
a
squadron
to
release
it
and
no
fortune
of
weather
could
possibly
bring
a
squadron
from
brest
hawke
who
had
the
main
blockade
might
be
blown
off
but
he
could
scarcely
fail
to
bring
to
action
any
squadron
that
attempted
to
enter
the
channel
with
the
morbihan
force
it
was
different
any
time
that
hawke
was
blown
off
a
squadron
could
reach
it
from
brest
and
break
the
cruiser
blockade
the
french
government
actually
ordered
a
portion
of
the
fleet
to
make
the
attempt
conflans
however
who
was
in
command
protested
his
force
was
too
weak
to
divide
owing
to
the
failure
of
the
intended
concentration
boscawen
had
caught
and
beaten
the
mediterranean
squadron
off
lagos
and
though
the
west
indian
squadron
got
in
it
proved
as
in
napoleon
great
plan
of
concentration
unfit
for
further
service
the
old
situation
had
arisen
forced
by
the
old
method
of
defence
and
in
the
end
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
for
conflans
to
take
his
whole
fleet
to
the
morbihan
transports
hawke
was
upon
him
at
once
and
the
disastrous
day
of
quiberon
was
the
result
the
dunkirk
division
alone
got
free
but
the
smallness
of
its
size
which
permitted
it
to
evade
the
watch
also
prevented
its
doing
any
harm
its
escort
after
landing
its
handful
of
troops
in
ireland
was
entirely
destroyed
and
so
again
the
attempt
of
the
french
to
invade
over
an
uncommanded
sea
produced
no
effect
but
the
loss
of
their
fleet
the
project
of
marked
these
principles
even
more
strongly
for
it
demonstrated
them
working
even
when
our
home
fleet
was
greatly
inferior
to
that
of
the
enemy
in
this
case
the
invader
idea
was
to
form
two
expeditionary
forces
at
cherbourg
and
havre
and
under
cover
of
an
overwhelming
combination
of
the
spanish
and
french
fleets
to
unite
them
at
sea
and
seize
portsmouth
and
the
isle
of
wight
it
was
in
the
early
summer
we
got
wind
of
the
scheme
and
two
cruiser
squadrons
and
flotillas
were
at
once
formed
at
the
downs
and
channel
islands
to
watch
the
french
coasts
and
prevent
the
concentration
of
transports
spain
had
not
yet
declared
war
but
she
was
suspected
and
the
main
fleet
under
the
veteran
sir
charles
hardy
who
had
been
norris
second
in
command
in
was
ordered
to
proceed
off
brest
and
prevent
any
spanish
squadron
that
might
appear
from
entering
that
port
the
french
however
outmanoeuvred
us
by
putting
to
sea
before
hardy
could
reach
his
station
and
forming
a
junction
with
the
spaniards
off
finisterre
the
combined
fleet
contained
about
fifty
of
the
line
nearly
double
our
own
the
army
of
invasion
with
dumouriez
for
its
chief
of
the
staff
numbered
some
men
a
force
we
were
in
no
condition
to
meet
ashore
everything
therefore
was
in
favour
of
success
and
yet
in
the
navy
at
least
a
feeling
of
confidence
prevailed
that
no
invasion
could
take
place
the
brains
of
the
naval
defence
were
lord
barham
then
sir
charles
middleton
at
the
admiralty
and
kempenfelt
as
chief
of
the
staff
in
the
fleet
and
it
is
to
their
correspondence
at
this
time
that
we
owe
some
of
the
most
valuable
strategical
appreciations
we
possess
the
idea
of
the
french
was
to
come
into
the
channel
in
their
overwhelming
force
and
while
they
destroyed
or
held
hardy
to
detach
a
sufficient
squadron
to
break
the
cruiser
blockade
and
escort
the
troops
across
kempenfelt
was
confident
that
it
could
not
be
done
he
was
sure
that
the
unwieldy
combined
mass
could
be
rendered
powerless
by
his
comparatively
homogeneous
and
mobile
fleet
inferior
as
it
was
so
long
as
he
could
keep
it
at
sea
and
to
the
westward
the
appreciation
of
the
power
of
a
nimble
inferior
fleet
which
he
wrote
at
this
time
has
already
been
given
when
the
worst
of
the
position
was
fully
known
and
the
enemy
was
reported
off
the
mouth
of
the
channel
he
wrote
another
to
middleton
his
only
doubt
was
whether
his
fleet
had
the
necessary
cohesion
and
mobility
we
do
seem
he
said
to
have
considered
sufficiently
a
certain
fact
that
the
comparative
force
of
two
fleets
depends
much
upon
their
sailing
the
fleet
that
sails
fastest
has
much
the
advantage
as
they
can
engage
or
not
as
they
please
and
so
have
always
in
their
power
to
choose
the
favourable
opportunity
to
attack
i
think
i
may
safely
hazard
an
opinion
that
sail
of
the
line
coppered
would
be
sufficient
to
harass
and
tease
this
great
unwieldy
combined
armada
so
as
to
prevent
their
effecting
anything
hanging
continually
upon
them
ready
to
catch
at
any
opportunity
of
a
separation
from
night
gale
or
fog
to
dart
upon
the
separated
to
cut
off
convoys
of
provisions
coming
to
them
and
if
they
attempted
an
invasion
to
oblige
their
whole
fleet
to
escort
the
transports
and
even
then
it
would
be
impossible
to
protect
them
entirely
from
so
active
and
nimble
a
fleet
here
we
have
from
the
pen
of
one
of
the
greatest
masters
the
real
key
of
the
solution
the
power
that
is
of
forcing
the
mass
of
the
enemy
fleet
to
escort
the
transports
hardy
of
course
knew
it
well
from
his
experience
of
and
acted
accordingly
this
case
is
the
more
striking
since
defence
against
the
threatened
invasion
was
not
the
whole
of
the
problem
he
had
to
solve
it
was
complicated
by
instructions
that
he
must
also
prevent
a
possible
descent
on
ireland
and
cover
the
arrival
of
the
great
convoys
in
reply
on
august
he
announced
his
intention
of
taking
station
ten
to
twenty
leagues
of
scilly
which
i
am
of
opinion
he
said
is
the
most
proper
station
for
the
security
of
the
trade
expected
from
the
east
and
west
indies
and
for
the
meeting
of
the
fleets
of
the
enemy
they
attempt
to
come
into
the
he
underlined
the
last
words
indicating
apparently
his
belief
that
they
would
not
venture
to
do
so
so
long
as
he
could
keep
his
fleet
to
the
westward
and
undefeated
this
at
least
he
did
till
a
month
later
he
found
it
necessary
to
come
in
for
supplies
then
still
avoiding
the
enemy
he
ran
not
to
plymouth
but
right
up
to
helen
the
movement
is
always
regarded
as
an
unworthy
retreat
and
it
caused
much
dissatisfaction
in
the
fleet
at
the
time
but
it
is
to
be
observed
that
his
conduct
was
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
principle
which
makes
the
invading
army
the
primary
objective
if
hardy
fleet
was
no
longer
fit
to
keep
the
sea
without
replenishment
then
the
proper
place
to
seek
replenishment
was
on
the
invader
line
of
passage
so
long
as
he
was
there
invasion
could
not
take
place
till
he
was
defeated
the
allies
it
was
true
were
now
free
to
join
their
transports
but
the
prospect
of
such
a
movement
gave
the
admiral
no
uneasiness
for
it
would
bring
him
the
chance
of
serving
his
enemy
as
the
spaniards
were
served
in
i
shall
do
my
utmost
he
said
to
drive
them
up
the
channel
it
is
the
old
principle
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
so
long
as
you
are
able
to
force
the
covering
fleet
upon
the
transports
and
especially
in
narrow
waters
invasion
becomes
an
operation
beyond
the
endurable
risks
of
war
so
it
proved
on
august
count
the
allied
had
made
the
lizard
and
for
a
fortnight
had
striven
to
bring
hardy
to
decisive
action
until
he
had
done
so
he
dared
neither
enter
the
channel
with
his
fleet
nor
detach
a
squadron
to
break
the
cruiser
blockades
at
the
invasion
bases
his
ineffectual
efforts
exhausted
his
fleet
endurance
which
the
distant
concentration
at
finisterre
had
already
severely
sapped
and
he
was
forced
to
return
impotent
to
brest
before
anything
had
been
accomplished
the
allies
were
not
able
to
take
the
sea
again
that
campaign
but
even
had
it
been
in
their
power
to
do
so
hardy
and
kempenfelt
could
have
played
their
defensive
game
indefinitely
and
with
chances
as
the
winter
drew
near
of
dealing
a
paralysing
blow
there
was
never
any
real
chance
of
success
though
it
is
true
dumouriez
thought
otherwise
he
believed
the
enterprise
might
have
gone
through
if
a
diversion
had
been
made
by
the
bulk
of
the
fleet
against
ireland
and
under
cover
of
it
a
de
delivered
upon
the
isle
of
wight
for
which
he
said
six
or
eight
of
the
line
would
have
been
enough
but
it
is
inconceivable
that
old
hands
like
hardy
and
kempenfelt
would
have
been
so
easily
beguiled
of
their
hold
on
the
line
of
passage
had
such
a
division
been
detached
up
the
channel
from
the
allied
fleet
they
would
surely
according
to
tradition
have
followed
it
with
either
a
superior
force
or
their
whole
squadron
the
projects
of
the
great
war
followed
the
same
course
under
napoleon
directions
they
ran
the
whole
gamut
of
every
scheme
that
ever
raised
delusive
hope
before
beginning
from
the
beginning
with
the
idea
of
stealing
his
army
across
in
he
was
met
with
the
usual
flotilla
defence
then
came
his
only
new
idea
which
was
to
arm
his
transport
flotilla
to
the
point
of
giving
it
power
to
force
a
passage
for
itself
we
replied
by
strengthening
our
flotilla
convinced
by
experiment
that
his
scheme
was
now
impracticable
he
set
his
mind
on
breaking
the
blockade
by
the
sudden
intrusion
of
a
flying
squadron
from
a
distance
to
this
end
various
plausible
schemes
were
worked
out
but
plan
after
plan
melted
in
his
hand
till
he
was
forced
to
face
the
inevitable
necessity
of
bringing
an
overwhelming
battle
force
up
to
his
transports
the
experience
of
two
centuries
had
taught
him
nothing
by
a
more
distant
concentration
than
had
ever
been
attempted
before
he
believed
he
could
break
the
fatal
hold
of
his
enemy
the
only
result
was
so
severely
to
exhaust
his
fleet
that
it
never
could
get
within
reach
of
the
real
difficulties
of
its
task
a
task
which
every
admiral
in
his
service
knew
to
be
beyond
the
strength
of
the
imperial
navy
nor
did
napoleon
even
approach
a
solution
of
the
problem
he
had
set
himself
invasion
over
an
uncommanded
sea
with
our
impregnable
flotilla
hold
covered
by
an
automatic
concentration
of
off
ushant
his
army
could
never
even
have
put
forth
unless
he
had
inflicted
upon
our
covering
fleet
such
a
defeat
as
would
have
given
him
command
of
the
sea
and
with
absolute
control
of
the
sea
the
passage
of
an
army
presents
no
difficulties
of
the
working
of
these
principles
under
modern
conditions
we
have
no
example
the
acquisition
of
free
movement
must
necessarily
modify
their
application
and
since
the
advent
of
steam
there
have
been
only
two
invasions
over
uncommanded
seas
that
of
the
crimea
in
and
that
of
manchuria
in
and
neither
of
these
cases
is
in
point
for
in
neither
was
there
any
attempt
at
naval
defence
still
there
seems
no
reason
to
believe
that
such
defence
applied
in
the
old
manner
would
be
less
effective
than
formerly
the
flotilla
was
its
basis
and
since
the
introduction
of
the
torpedo
the
power
of
the
flotilla
has
greatly
increased
its
real
and
moral
effect
against
transports
must
certainly
be
greater
than
ever
and
the
power
of
squadrons
to
break
a
flotilla
blockade
is
more
restricted
mines
again
tell
almost
entirely
in
favour
of
defence
so
much
so
indeed
as
to
render
a
rapid
de
against
any
important
port
almost
an
impossibility
in
the
absence
of
all
experience
it
is
to
such
theoretical
considerations
we
must
turn
for
light
theoretically
stated
the
success
of
our
old
system
of
defence
depended
on
four
relations
firstly
there
is
the
relation
between
the
rapidity
with
which
an
invasion
force
could
be
mobilised
and
embarked
and
the
rapidity
with
which
restlessness
in
foreign
ports
and
could
be
reported
that
is
to
say
the
chance
of
surprise
and
evasion
are
as
the
speed
of
preparation
to
the
speed
of
intelligence
secondly
there
is
the
relation
of
the
speed
of
convoys
to
the
speed
of
cruisers
and
flotilla
that
is
to
say
our
ability
to
get
contact
with
a
convoy
after
it
has
put
to
sea
and
before
the
expedition
can
be
disembarked
is
as
the
speed
of
our
cruisers
and
flotilla
to
the
speed
of
the
convoy
thirdly
there
is
the
relation
between
the
destructive
power
of
modern
cruisers
and
flotillas
against
a
convoy
unescorted
or
weakly
escorted
and
the
corresponding
power
in
sailing
days
fourthly
there
is
the
relation
between
the
speed
of
convoys
and
the
speed
of
which
is
of
importance
where
the
enemy
transports
are
likely
to
be
strongly
escorted
on
this
relation
depends
the
facility
with
which
the
covering
our
mobile
defence
can
secure
an
interior
position
from
which
it
may
strike
either
the
if
it
moves
or
his
convoy
before
it
can
complete
its
passage
and
effect
the
landing
all
these
relations
appear
to
have
been
modified
by
modern
developments
in
favour
of
the
defence
in
the
first
ratio
that
of
speed
of
mobilisation
to
speed
of
intelligence
it
is
obviously
so
although
military
mobilisation
may
be
still
relatively
as
rapid
as
the
mobilisation
of
fleets
yet
intelligence
has
outstripped
both
this
is
true
both
for
gaining
and
for
conveying
intelligence
preparations
for
oversea
invasion
were
never
easy
to
conceal
owing
to
the
disturbance
of
the
flow
of
shipping
that
they
caused
elaborate
precautions
were
taken
to
prevent
commercial
leakage
of
intelligence
but
they
never
entirely
succeeded
yet
formerly
in
the
condition
of
comparative
crudeness
with
which
international
trade
was
then
organised
concealment
was
relatively
easy
at
least
for
a
time
but
the
sensitiveness
of
commerce
when
market
movements
are
reported
from
hour
to
hour
instead
of
from
week
to
week
has
greatly
increased
the
difficulty
and
apart
from
the
rapidity
with
which
information
may
be
gathered
through
this
alert
and
intimate
sympathy
between
exchanges
there
is
the
still
more
important
fact
that
with
wireless
the
speed
of
conveying
naval
intelligence
has
increased
in
a
far
higher
ratio
than
the
speed
of
sea
transit
as
regards
the
ratio
between
cruiser
and
convoy
speeds
on
which
evasion
so
much
depends
it
is
the
same
in
frigate
days
the
ratio
appears
to
have
been
not
more
than
seven
to
five
now
in
the
case
at
any
rate
of
large
convoys
it
would
be
nearly
double
of
the
destructive
power
of
the
flotilla
growing
as
it
does
from
year
to
year
enough
has
been
said
already
with
the
advent
of
the
torpedo
and
submarine
it
has
probably
increased
tenfold
in
a
lesser
degree
the
same
is
true
of
cruisers
in
former
days
the
physical
power
of
a
cruiser
to
injure
a
dispersing
convoy
was
comparatively
low
owing
to
her
relatively
low
excess
of
speed
and
the
restricted
range
and
destructive
power
of
her
guns
with
higher
speed
and
higher
energy
and
range
in
gun
power
the
ability
of
cruisers
to
cut
up
a
convoy
renders
its
practical
annihilation
almost
certain
if
once
it
be
caught
and
consequently
affords
a
moral
deterrent
against
trusting
to
evasion
beyond
anything
that
was
known
before
the
increased
ratio
of
speed
to
that
of
large
convoys
is
equally
indisputable
and
no
less
important
for
the
facility
of
finding
interior
positions
which
it
implies
goes
to
the
root
of
the
old
system
so
long
as
our
is
in
a
position
whence
it
can
cover
our
flotilla
blockade
or
strike
the
enemy
convoy
in
transit
it
forces
his
in
the
last
resort
to
close
up
on
the
convoy
and
that
as
kempenfelt
pointed
out
is
practically
fatal
to
the
success
of
invasion
from
whatever
point
of
view
then
we
regard
the
future
chances
of
successful
invasion
over
an
uncommanded
sea
it
would
seem
that
not
only
does
the
old
system
hold
good
but
that
all
modern
developments
which
touch
the
question
bid
fair
to
intensify
the
results
which
our
sea
service
at
least
used
so
confidently
to
expect
and
which
it
never
failed
to
secure
ii
attack
and
defence
of
trade
the
base
idea
of
the
attack
and
defence
of
trade
may
be
summed
up
in
the
old
adage
where
the
carcase
is
there
will
the
eagles
be
gathered
together
the
most
fertile
areas
always
attracted
the
strongest
attack
and
therefore
required
the
strongest
defence
and
between
the
fertile
and
the
infertile
areas
it
was
possible
to
draw
a
line
which
for
strategical
purposes
was
definite
and
constant
the
fertile
areas
were
the
terminals
of
departure
and
destination
where
trade
tends
to
be
crowded
and
in
a
secondary
degree
the
focal
points
where
owing
to
the
conformation
of
the
land
trade
tends
to
converge
the
infertile
areas
were
the
great
routes
which
passed
through
the
focal
points
and
connected
the
terminal
areas
consequently
attack
on
commerce
tends
to
take
one
of
two
forms
it
may
be
terminal
or
it
may
be
pelagic
terminal
attack
being
the
more
profitable
but
demanding
the
greater
force
and
risk
and
pelagic
attack
being
the
more
uncertain
but
involving
less
force
and
risk
these
considerations
lead
us
directly
to
the
paradox
which
underlies
the
unbroken
failure
of
our
enemies
to
exercise
decisive
pressure
upon
us
by
operations
against
our
trade
it
is
that
where
attack
is
most
to
be
feared
there
defence
is
easiest
a
plan
of
war
which
has
the
destruction
of
trade
for
its
primary
object
implies
in
the
party
using
it
an
inferiority
at
sea
had
he
superiority
his
object
would
be
to
convert
that
superiority
to
a
working
command
by
battle
or
blockade
except
therefore
in
the
rare
cases
where
the
opposed
forces
are
equal
we
must
assume
that
the
belligerent
who
makes
commerce
destruction
his
primary
object
will
have
to
deal
with
a
superior
fleet
now
it
is
true
that
the
difficulty
of
defending
trade
lies
mainly
in
the
extent
of
sea
it
covers
but
on
the
other
hand
the
areas
in
which
it
tends
to
congregate
and
in
which
alone
it
is
seriously
vulnerable
are
few
and
narrow
and
can
be
easily
occupied
if
we
are
in
superior
force
beyond
those
areas
effective
occupation
is
impossible
but
so
also
is
effective
attack
hence
the
controlling
fact
of
war
on
commerce
that
facility
of
attack
means
facility
of
defence
beside
this
fundamental
principle
we
must
place
another
that
is
scarcely
less
important
owing
to
the
general
common
nature
of
sea
communications
attack
and
defence
of
trade
are
so
intimately
connected
that
the
one
operation
is
almost
indistinguishable
from
the
other
both
ideas
are
satisfied
by
occupying
the
common
communications
the
strongest
form
of
attack
is
the
occupation
of
the
enemy
terminals
and
the
establishment
of
a
commercial
blockade
of
the
ports
they
contain
but
as
this
operation
usually
requires
the
blockade
of
an
adjacent
naval
port
it
also
constitutes
as
a
rule
a
defensive
disposition
for
our
own
trade
even
when
the
enemy
terminal
area
does
not
overlap
one
of
our
own
in
the
occupation
of
focal
areas
the
two
ideas
are
even
more
inseparable
since
most
if
not
all
such
areas
are
on
lines
of
communication
that
are
common
it
will
suffice
therefore
to
deal
with
the
general
aspect
of
the
subject
from
the
point
of
view
of
defence
it
was
in
conformity
with
the
distinction
between
fertile
and
infertile
areas
that
our
old
system
of
trade
defence
was
developed
broadly
speaking
that
system
was
to
hold
the
terminals
in
strength
and
in
important
cases
the
focal
points
as
well
by
means
of
a
with
a
full
complement
of
cruisers
they
were
constituted
defended
areas
or
tracts
as
the
old
term
was
and
the
trade
was
regarded
as
safe
when
it
entered
them
the
intervening
were
left
as
a
rule
undefended
thus
our
home
terminals
were
held
by
two
the
western
squadron
at
the
mouth
of
the
channel
and
the
north
sea
or
eastern
squadron
with
its
headquarters
usually
in
the
downs
to
these
was
added
a
cruiser
squadron
on
the
irish
station
based
at
cork
which
was
sometimes
subordinate
to
the
western
squadron
and
sometimes
an
independent
organisation
the
area
of
the
western
squadron
in
the
french
wars
extended
as
we
have
seen
over
the
whole
bay
of
biscay
with
the
double
function
so
far
as
commerce
was
concerned
of
preventing
the
issue
of
raiding
squadrons
from
the
ports
and
acting
offensively
against
his
atlantic
trade
that
of
the
north
sea
squadron
extended
to
the
mouth
of
the
baltic
and
the
passage
its
main
function
during
the
great
naval
coalitions
against
us
was
to
check
the
operations
of
dutch
squadrons
or
to
prevent
the
intrusion
of
french
ones
against
our
baltic
trade
like
the
western
squadron
it
threw
out
divisions
usually
located
at
yarmouth
and
leith
for
the
protection
of
our
coastwise
trade
from
privateers
and
sporadic
cruisers
acting
from
ports
within
the
defended
area
similarly
between
the
downs
and
the
western
squadron
was
usually
one
or
more
smaller
squadrons
mainly
cruisers
and
generally
located
about
havre
and
the
channel
islands
which
served
the
same
purpose
for
the
norman
and
north
breton
ports
to
complete
the
system
there
were
flotilla
patrols
acting
under
the
port
admirals
and
doing
their
best
to
police
the
routes
of
the
coastwise
and
local
traffic
which
then
had
an
importance
long
since
lost
the
home
system
of
course
differed
at
different
times
but
it
was
always
on
these
general
lines
the
naval
defence
was
supplemented
by
defended
ports
of
refuge
the
principal
ones
being
on
the
coast
of
ireland
to
shelter
the
ocean
trade
but
others
in
great
numbers
were
provided
within
the
defended
areas
against
the
operations
of
privateers
and
the
ruins
of
batteries
all
round
the
british
shores
testify
how
complete
was
the
organisation
a
similar
system
prevailed
in
the
colonial
areas
but
there
the
naval
defence
consisted
normally
of
cruiser
squadrons
stiffened
with
one
or
two
mainly
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
the
flag
they
were
only
occupied
by
when
the
enemy
threatened
operations
with
a
similar
force
the
minor
or
interior
defence
against
local
privateers
was
to
a
large
extent
local
that
is
the
great
part
of
the
flotilla
was
furnished
by
sloops
built
or
hired
on
the
spot
as
being
best
adapted
for
the
service
focal
points
were
not
then
so
numerous
as
they
have
become
since
the
development
of
the
far
eastern
trade
the
most
important
of
them
the
straits
of
gibraltar
was
treated
as
a
defended
area
from
the
point
of
view
of
it
was
held
by
the
mediterranean
squadron
by
keeping
watch
on
toulon
that
squadron
covered
not
only
the
straits
but
also
the
focal
points
within
the
sea
it
too
had
its
extended
divisions
sometimes
as
many
as
four
one
about
the
approaches
to
leghorn
one
in
the
adriatic
a
third
at
malta
and
the
fourth
at
gibraltar
in
cases
of
war
with
spain
the
latter
was
very
strong
so
as
to
secure
the
focal
area
against
cartagena
and
cadiz
on
one
occasion
indeed
in
as
we
have
seen
it
was
constituted
for
a
short
time
an
independent
area
with
a
special
squadron
but
in
any
case
the
gibraltar
area
had
its
own
internal
flotilla
guard
under
the
direction
of
the
port
admiral
as
a
defence
against
local
privateers
and
pirates
the
general
theory
of
these
defended
terminal
and
focal
areas
it
will
be
seen
was
to
hold
in
force
those
waters
which
converging
trade
made
most
fertile
and
which
therefore
furnished
an
adequate
field
for
the
operations
of
raiding
squadrons
in
spite
of
the
elaborate
defensive
system
such
squadrons
might
and
sometimes
did
intrude
by
surprise
or
stealth
and
were
then
able
to
set
at
defiance
both
convoy
escorts
and
the
cruiser
outposts
but
as
experience
proved
the
system
of
terminal
defence
by
made
it
impossible
for
such
raiding
squadrons
to
remain
long
enough
on
the
ground
to
cause
any
serious
interruption
or
to
do
serious
harm
it
was
only
by
a
regular
fleet
of
superior
strength
that
the
system
could
be
broken
down
in
other
words
the
defence
could
only
fall
when
our
means
of
local
control
was
destroyed
by
battle
so
much
for
the
defended
areas
with
regard
to
the
great
routes
that
connected
them
it
has
been
said
they
were
left
undefended
by
this
is
meant
that
the
security
of
ships
passing
along
them
was
provided
for
not
by
patrols
but
by
escort
the
convoy
system
was
adopted
and
the
theory
of
that
system
is
that
while
vessels
are
on
the
great
routes
they
are
normally
liable
only
to
sporadic
attack
and
they
are
consequently
collected
into
fleets
and
furnished
with
an
escort
sufficient
to
repel
sporadic
attack
in
theory
cruiser
escort
is
sufficient
but
in
practice
it
was
found
convenient
and
economical
to
assign
the
duty
in
part
to
which
were
going
out
to
join
the
distant
terminal
squadron
or
returning
from
it
for
a
refit
or
some
other
reason
in
other
words
the
system
of
foreign
reliefs
was
made
to
work
in
with
the
supplementary
escort
system
where
no
such
ships
were
available
and
the
convoys
were
of
great
value
or
enemy
were
known
to
be
out
similar
units
were
specially
detailed
for
convoy
duty
to
go
and
return
but
this
use
of
battle
units
was
exceptional
such
a
method
of
dealing
with
the
great
routes
is
the
corollary
of
the
idea
of
defended
areas
as
those
areas
were
fertile
and
likely
to
attract
raiding
squadrons
so
the
great
routes
were
infertile
and
no
enemy
could
afford
to
spend
squadrons
upon
them
it
is
obvious
however
that
the
system
had
its
weak
side
for
the
mere
fact
that
a
convoy
was
upon
a
great
route
tended
to
attract
a
squadron
and
the
comparative
immunity
of
those
routes
was
lost
the
danger
was
provided
for
to
a
great
extent
by
the
fact
that
the
enemy
ports
from
which
a
squadron
could
issue
were
all
within
defended
areas
and
watched
by
our
own
squadrons
still
the
guard
could
not
be
made
impenetrable
there
was
always
the
chance
of
a
squadron
escaping
and
if
it
escaped
towards
a
critical
it
must
be
followed
hence
there
were
times
when
the
convoy
system
seriously
disturbed
our
dispositions
as
for
instance
in
the
crisis
of
the
trafalgar
campaign
when
for
a
short
time
our
chain
of
defended
areas
was
broken
down
by
the
escape
of
the
toulon
squadron
that
escape
eventually
forced
a
close
concentration
on
the
western
squadron
but
all
other
considerations
apart
it
was
felt
to
be
impossible
to
retain
the
mass
for
more
than
two
days
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
great
east
and
west
indies
convoys
were
approaching
and
villeneuve
return
to
ferrol
from
martinique
exposed
them
to
squadronal
attack
it
was
in
fact
impossible
to
tell
whether
the
mass
had
not
been
forced
upon
us
with
this
special
end
in
view
in
the
liability
to
deflection
of
this
kind
lay
the
most
serious
strategical
objection
to
the
convoy
system
it
was
sought
to
minimise
it
by
giving
the
convoys
a
secret
route
when
there
was
apprehension
of
squadronal
interference
it
was
done
in
the
case
just
cited
but
the
precaution
seemed
in
no
way
to
lessen
the
anxiety
it
may
have
been
because
in
those
days
of
slow
communication
there
could
be
no
such
certainty
that
the
secret
route
had
been
received
as
there
would
be
now
modern
developments
and
changes
in
shipping
and
naval
material
have
indeed
so
profoundly
modified
the
whole
conditions
of
commerce
protection
that
there
is
no
part
of
strategy
where
historical
deduction
is
more
difficult
or
more
liable
to
error
to
avoid
such
error
as
far
as
possible
it
is
essential
to
keep
those
developments
in
mind
at
every
step
the
more
important
of
them
are
three
in
number
firstly
the
abolition
of
privateering
secondly
the
reduced
range
of
action
for
all
warships
and
thirdly
the
development
of
wireless
telegraphy
there
are
others
which
must
be
dealt
with
in
their
place
but
these
three
go
to
the
root
of
the
whole
problem
difficult
as
it
is
to
arrive
at
exact
statistics
of
commerce
destruction
in
the
old
wars
one
thing
seems
certain
that
the
bulk
of
captures
which
were
reckoned
in
hundreds
and
sometimes
even
in
thousands
were
due
to
the
action
of
privateers
further
it
seems
certain
that
reckoning
at
least
by
numbers
the
greater
part
of
the
damage
was
done
by
small
privateers
operating
close
to
their
bases
either
home
or
colonial
against
coastwise
and
local
traffic
the
complaints
of
merchants
so
far
as
they
are
known
relate
mainly
to
this
kind
of
work
in
the
west
indies
and
home
waters
while
accounts
of
serious
captures
by
large
privateers
on
the
high
seas
are
comparatively
rare
the
actual
damage
done
by
the
swarm
of
small
vessels
may
not
have
been
great
but
its
moral
effects
were
very
serious
it
was
impossible
for
the
strongest
governments
to
ignore
them
and
the
consequence
was
a
chronic
disturbance
of
the
larger
strategical
dispositions
while
these
dispositions
were
adequate
to
check
the
operations
of
large
privateers
acting
in
the
same
way
as
regular
cruisers
the
smaller
ones
found
very
free
play
amidst
the
ribwork
of
the
protective
system
and
they
could
only
be
dealt
with
by
filling
up
the
spaces
with
a
swarm
of
small
cruisers
to
the
serious
detriment
of
the
larger
arrangements
even
so
the
proximity
of
the
enemy
ports
made
escape
so
easy
that
the
work
of
repression
was
very
ineffective
the
state
of
the
case
was
indeed
almost
identical
with
a
people
war
the
ordinary
devices
of
strategy
failed
to
deal
with
it
as
completely
as
napoleon
broadly
planned
methods
failed
to
deal
with
the
in
spain
or
as
our
own
failed
for
so
long
in
south
africa
by
the
abolition
of
privateering
then
it
would
seem
that
the
most
disturbing
part
of
the
problem
has
been
eliminated
it
is
of
course
uncertain
how
far
the
declaration
of
paris
will
hold
good
in
practice
it
is
still
open
even
to
the
parties
to
it
to
evade
its
restrictions
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
by
taking
up
and
commissioning
merchantmen
as
regular
ships
of
war
but
it
is
unlikely
that
such
methods
will
extend
beyond
the
larger
privately
owned
vessels
any
attempt
to
revive
in
this
way
the
old
methods
could
only
amount
to
a
virtual
repudiation
of
statutory
international
law
which
would
bring
its
own
retribution
moreover
for
home
waters
at
least
the
conditions
which
favoured
this
warfare
no
longer
exist
in
the
old
wars
the
bulk
of
our
trade
came
into
the
thames
and
thence
the
greater
part
of
it
was
distributed
in
small
coasting
vessels
it
was
against
this
coastwise
traffic
that
the
small
privateers
found
their
opportunity
and
their
richest
harvest
but
now
that
so
many
other
great
centres
of
distribution
have
established
themselves
and
that
the
bulk
of
the
distribution
is
done
by
internal
lines
of
communication
the
channel
is
no
longer
the
sole
artery
and
the
old
troublesome
disturbance
can
be
avoided
without
a
vital
dislocation
of
our
commercial
system
the
probability
then
is
that
in
the
future
the
whole
problem
will
be
found
to
be
simplified
and
that
the
work
of
commerce
protection
will
lie
much
more
within
the
scope
of
large
strategical
treatment
than
it
ever
did
before
with
the
result
that
the
change
should
be
found
to
tell
substantially
in
favour
of
defence
and
against
attack
the
reduction
of
range
of
action
is
scarcely
less
important
in
the
old
days
a
cruising
ship
could
be
stored
for
six
months
and
so
long
as
she
could
occasionally
renew
her
fuel
and
water
she
was
free
to
range
the
sea
outside
the
defended
areas
for
the
whole
of
the
period
with
unimpaired
vitality
for
such
pelagic
operations
her
movement
was
practically
unrestricted
she
could
run
for
two
or
three
days
from
a
superior
enemy
or
chase
for
as
long
without
loss
of
energy
and
she
could
wait
indefinitely
at
a
likely
spot
or
change
her
ground
as
danger
or
hope
of
plunder
dictated
so
long
as
she
had
men
left
to
man
her
prizes
her
power
of
mischief
was
almost
unlimited
all
this
is
now
changed
the
capacity
of
each
cruise
of
a
ship
is
very
small
she
is
confined
to
short
dashes
within
a
strategically
defended
area
or
if
she
is
bent
on
pelagic
operations
is
compelled
to
proceed
so
far
to
find
undefended
waters
that
her
coal
will
scarcely
permit
of
more
than
a
few
days
actual
cruising
a
couple
of
chases
at
high
speed
during
that
period
may
force
her
to
return
at
once
subject
only
to
the
precarious
possibility
of
renewing
her
coal
from
a
prize
she
has
further
to
face
the
fact
that
manning
prizes
must
necessarily
reduce
her
capacity
for
speed
which
depends
so
much
on
a
fully
manned
this
will
tend
to
jeopardise
her
chances
of
return
through
or
near
defended
areas
the
only
escape
from
this
difficulty
is
to
sink
the
captured
ship
but
this
course
has
objections
scarcely
less
weighty
than
the
other
no
power
will
incur
the
odium
of
sinking
a
prize
with
all
hands
and
their
removal
to
the
captor
ship
takes
time
especially
in
bad
weather
and
the
presence
of
such
prisoners
in
a
cruiser
in
any
number
soon
becomes
a
serious
check
on
her
fighting
power
in
the
case
of
large
ships
moreover
the
work
of
destruction
is
no
easy
matter
in
the
most
favourable
circumstances
it
takes
a
considerable
time
and
thus
not
only
eats
into
the
cruiser
endurance
but
decreases
her
chances
of
evasion
from
these
and
similar
considerations
it
is
obvious
that
the
possibilities
of
operations
on
the
great
are
much
less
extensive
than
they
were
formerly
while
to
speak
of
cruisers
infesting
those
routes
is
sheer
hyperbole
under
modern
conditions
it
is
scarcely
more
feasible
than
it
would
be
to
keep
up
a
permanent
blockade
of
the
british
islands
it
would
require
a
flow
of
ships
in
such
numbers
as
no
country
but
our
own
can
contemplate
possessing
and
such
as
could
not
be
maintained
without
having
first
secured
a
very
decided
preponderance
at
sea
the
loss
of
radius
of
action
therefore
though
it
does
not
increase
the
power
of
defence
sensibly
lessens
that
of
attack
by
pelagic
operations
for
the
great
increase
in
the
powers
of
defence
we
must
turn
to
the
extraordinary
development
in
the
means
of
distant
communication
under
former
conditions
it
was
possible
for
a
cruising
ship
to
remain
for
days
upon
a
fertile
spot
and
make
a
number
of
captures
before
her
presence
was
known
but
since
most
large
merchantmen
have
been
fitted
with
wireless
installations
she
can
not
now
attack
a
single
one
of
them
without
fear
of
calling
down
upon
her
an
adversary
moreover
when
she
is
once
located
every
ship
within
wireless
reach
can
be
warned
of
her
presence
and
avoid
her
she
must
widely
and
constantly
shift
her
position
thereby
still
further
reducing
her
staying
power
on
the
whole
then
it
would
appear
that
in
so
far
as
modern
developments
affect
the
problem
they
certainly
render
pelagic
operations
far
more
difficult
and
uncertain
than
they
used
to
be
upon
the
great
routes
the
power
of
attack
has
been
reduced
and
the
means
of
evasion
has
increased
to
such
an
extent
as
to
demand
entire
reconsideration
of
the
defence
of
trade
between
terminal
areas
the
whole
basis
of
the
old
system
would
seem
to
be
involved
that
basis
was
the
convoy
system
and
it
now
becomes
doubtful
whether
the
additional
security
which
convoys
afforded
is
sufficient
to
outweigh
their
economical
drawbacks
and
their
liability
to
cause
strategical
disturbance
over
and
above
the
considerations
already
noticed
there
are
three
others
all
of
which
favour
the
security
of
our
trade
by
permitting
a
much
more
extended
choice
of
route
the
first
is
that
steam
vessels
are
not
forced
by
prevailing
winds
to
keep
to
particular
courses
the
second
is
that
the
improvements
in
the
art
of
navigation
no
longer
render
it
so
necessary
to
make
landfalls
during
transit
the
third
is
that
the
multiplication
of
our
great
ports
of
distribution
have
divided
the
old
main
flow
of
trade
to
the
channel
into
a
number
of
minor
streams
that
cover
a
much
wider
area
and
demand
a
greater
distribution
of
force
for
effective
attack
it
will
be
obvious
that
the
combined
effect
of
these
considerations
is
to
increase
still
further
the
chances
of
individual
vessels
evading
the
enemy
cruisers
and
to
lessen
the
risk
of
dispensing
with
escort
nor
are
the
new
practical
difficulties
of
sporadic
operations
on
the
great
routes
the
only
arguments
that
minimise
the
value
of
convoys
we
have
also
to
remember
that
while
the
number
of
vessels
trading
across
the
ocean
has
enormously
increased
since
it
is
scarcely
possible
even
if
the
abolition
of
privateering
prove
abortive
that
the
number
of
cruisers
available
for
pelagic
attack
could
exceed
or
even
equal
the
number
employed
in
sailing
days
this
consideration
then
must
also
be
thrown
into
the
scale
against
convoys
for
it
is
certain
that
the
amount
of
serious
operative
damage
which
an
enemy
can
do
to
our
trade
by
pelagic
operation
is
mainly
determined
by
the
ratio
which
his
available
cruiser
strength
bears
to
the
volume
of
that
trade
this
aspect
of
the
question
is
however
part
of
a
much
wider
one
which
concerns
the
relation
which
the
volume
of
our
trade
bears
to
the
difficulty
of
its
defence
and
this
must
be
considered
later
it
remains
first
to
deal
with
the
final
link
in
the
old
system
of
defence
the
statement
that
the
great
routes
were
left
undefended
will
seem
to
be
in
opposition
to
a
prevailing
impression
derived
from
the
fact
that
frigates
are
constantly
mentioned
as
being
on
a
cruise
the
assumption
is
that
they
in
effect
patrolled
the
great
routes
but
this
was
not
so
nor
did
they
rove
the
sea
at
will
they
constituted
a
definite
and
necessary
part
of
the
system
though
that
system
was
founded
on
a
distinction
between
defended
terminals
and
undefended
routes
which
was
a
real
strategical
distinction
it
was
impossible
to
draw
an
actual
line
where
the
one
sphere
began
and
the
other
ended
outside
the
regularly
defended
areas
lay
a
region
which
as
the
routes
began
to
converge
was
comparatively
fertile
in
this
region
enemies
cruisers
and
their
larger
privateers
found
the
mean
between
risk
and
profit
here
too
convoys
as
they
entered
the
zone
were
in
their
greatest
danger
for
fear
of
their
escorts
being
overpowered
by
raiding
squadrons
consequently
it
was
the
practice
when
the
approach
of
convoys
was
expected
to
throw
forward
from
the
defended
area
groups
of
powerful
cruisers
and
even
battleship
divisions
to
meet
them
and
reinforce
their
escorts
convoys
had
their
escorts
similarly
strengthened
till
they
were
clear
of
the
danger
zone
the
system
was
in
regular
use
both
for
home
and
colonial
areas
in
no
sense
did
it
constitute
a
patrol
of
the
routes
it
was
in
practice
and
conception
a
system
of
outposts
which
at
seasons
of
special
risk
amounted
to
an
extension
of
the
defended
areas
combining
with
a
reinforcement
of
the
convoy
escorts
focal
points
of
lesser
importance
such
as
capes
finisterre
and
vincent
were
similarly
held
by
one
or
two
powerful
cruisers
and
if
necessary
by
a
squadron
as
has
been
already
explained
owing
to
the
peculiar
conditions
of
the
sea
and
the
common
nature
of
maritime
communications
these
dispositions
were
adopted
as
well
for
attack
as
defence
and
the
fertile
areas
for
the
defence
of
which
a
frigate
captain
was
sent
on
a
cruise
were
always
liable
to
bring
him
rich
reward
his
mission
of
defence
carried
with
it
the
best
opportunities
for
attack
in
the
full
development
of
the
system
patrol
lines
did
exist
but
not
for
the
great
routes
they
were
established
to
link
up
adjacent
defended
areas
and
as
a
more
scientific
organisation
of
the
cruiser
outposts
in
the
gibraltar
and
the
home
areas
were
thus
connected
by
a
patrol
line
which
stretched
from
cape
vincent
through
the
finisterre
focal
area
to
cape
clear
with
a
branch
extending
to
the
strategical
centre
off
ushant
the
new
system
was
introduced
at
a
time
when
we
had
reason
to
expect
that
the
french
and
spanish
fleets
were
to
be
devoted
entirely
to
operations
in
small
raiding
squadrons
against
our
trade
and
colonies
special
provision
was
therefore
necessary
to
locate
any
such
squadrons
that
might
elude
the
regular
blockades
and
to
ensure
that
they
should
be
adequately
pursued
the
new
lines
were
in
fact
intelligence
patrols
primarily
though
they
were
also
regarded
as
the
only
means
of
protecting
efficiently
the
southern
where
it
was
flanked
by
french
and
spanish
ports
it
should
be
said
that
cornwallis
did
not
regard
this
system
as
new
except
for
the
extension
from
finisterre
to
vincent
which
nelson
advised
in
acknowledging
the
order
from
ushant
he
wrote
the
instructions
are
nearly
the
same
as
have
generally
been
given
i
can
therefore
only
guess
why
a
copy
of
the
order
was
sent
to
me
september
the
whole
system
it
will
be
observed
though
not
conflicting
with
the
main
object
of
bringing
the
enemy
fleets
to
action
did
entail
an
expenditure
of
force
and
deflecting
preoccupations
such
as
are
unknown
in
land
warfare
large
numbers
of
cruisers
had
to
be
employed
otherwise
than
as
the
eyes
of
the
while
the
coming
and
going
of
convoys
produced
periodical
oscillations
in
the
general
distribution
embarrassing
as
was
this
commercial
deflection
in
the
old
wars
an
impression
appears
to
prevail
that
in
the
future
it
must
be
much
more
serious
it
is
argued
plausibly
enough
not
only
that
our
trade
is
far
larger
and
richer
than
it
was
but
also
that
owing
to
certain
economic
changes
it
is
far
more
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
the
nation
than
in
the
days
when
food
and
raw
material
did
not
constitute
the
bulk
of
our
imports
in
view
of
the
new
conditions
it
is
held
that
we
are
more
vulnerable
through
our
trade
now
than
formerly
and
that
consequently
we
must
devote
relatively
more
attention
and
force
to
its
defence
if
this
were
true
it
is
obvious
that
war
with
a
strong
naval
combination
would
present
difficulties
of
the
most
formidable
kind
greater
indeed
than
we
have
ever
experienced
for
since
with
modern
developments
the
demand
for
fleet
cruisers
is
much
greater
than
formerly
the
power
of
devoting
cruisers
to
trade
defence
is
relatively
much
less
it
can
not
be
denied
that
at
first
sight
the
conclusion
looks
irreproachable
but
on
analysis
it
will
be
found
to
involve
two
assumptions
both
of
which
are
highly
questionable
the
first
is
that
the
vulnerability
of
a
sea
power
through
its
maritime
trade
is
as
the
volume
of
that
trade
the
second
is
that
the
difficulty
of
defending
trade
is
also
as
its
volume
that
is
to
say
the
larger
the
amount
of
the
trade
the
larger
must
be
the
force
devoted
to
its
protection
this
idea
indeed
is
carried
so
far
that
we
are
frequently
invited
to
fix
the
standard
of
our
naval
strength
by
comparing
it
with
the
proportion
which
the
naval
strength
of
other
powers
bears
to
their
trade
it
is
hoped
that
the
foregoing
sketch
of
our
traditional
system
of
trade
defence
will
avail
to
raise
a
doubt
whether
either
assumption
can
be
accepted
without
very
careful
consideration
in
the
history
of
that
system
there
is
no
indication
that
it
was
affected
by
the
volume
of
the
trade
it
was
designed
to
protect
nor
has
any
one
succeeded
in
showing
that
the
pressure
which
an
enemy
could
exert
upon
us
through
our
commerce
increased
in
effect
with
the
volume
of
our
seaborne
trade
the
broad
indications
indeed
are
the
other
way
that
the
greater
the
volume
of
our
trade
the
less
was
the
effective
impression
which
an
enemy
could
make
upon
it
even
when
he
devoted
his
whole
naval
energies
to
that
end
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
in
every
case
where
he
took
this
course
his
own
trade
dwindled
to
nothing
while
ours
continually
increased
it
may
be
objected
that
this
was
because
the
only
periods
in
which
he
devoted
his
main
efforts
to
trade
destruction
were
when
we
had
dominated
his
navy
and
being
no
longer
able
to
dispute
the
command
he
could
do
no
more
than
interfere
with
its
exercise
but
this
must
always
be
so
whether
we
have
positively
dominated
his
navy
or
not
if
he
tries
to
ignore
our
and
devotes
himself
to
operations
against
trade
he
can
not
dispute
the
command
whatever
his
strength
he
must
leave
the
command
to
us
he
can
not
do
both
systematically
and
unless
he
attacks
our
trade
systematically
by
sustained
strategical
operation
he
can
not
hope
to
make
any
real
impression
if
now
we
take
the
two
assumptions
and
test
them
by
the
application
of
elementary
principles
both
will
appear
theoretically
unsound
let
us
take
first
the
relation
of
vulnerability
to
volume
since
the
object
of
war
is
to
force
our
will
upon
the
enemy
the
only
way
in
which
we
can
expect
war
on
commerce
to
serve
our
end
is
to
inflict
so
much
damage
upon
it
as
will
cause
our
enemy
to
prefer
peace
on
our
terms
to
a
continuation
of
the
struggle
the
pressure
on
his
trade
must
be
insupportable
not
merely
annoying
it
must
seriously
cripple
his
finance
or
seriously
threaten
to
strangle
his
national
life
and
activities
if
his
total
trade
be
a
hundred
millions
and
we
succeed
in
destroying
five
he
will
feel
it
no
more
than
he
does
the
ordinary
fluctuations
to
which
he
is
accustomed
in
time
of
peace
if
however
we
can
destroy
fifty
millions
his
trade
equilibrium
will
be
overthrown
and
the
issue
of
the
war
will
be
powerfully
affected
in
other
words
to
affect
the
issue
the
impression
made
on
trade
must
be
a
percentage
or
relative
impression
the
measure
of
a
nation
vulnerability
through
its
trade
is
the
percentage
of
destruction
that
an
enemy
can
effect
now
it
is
true
that
the
amount
of
damage
which
a
belligerent
can
inflict
with
a
given
force
on
an
enemy
commerce
will
vary
to
some
extent
with
its
volume
for
the
greater
the
volume
of
commerce
the
more
fertile
will
be
the
undefended
cruising
grounds
but
no
matter
how
fertile
such
areas
might
be
the
destructive
power
of
a
cruiser
was
always
limited
and
it
must
be
still
more
limited
in
the
future
it
was
limited
by
the
fact
that
it
was
physically
impossible
to
deal
with
more
than
a
certain
number
of
prizes
in
a
certain
time
and
for
the
reasons
already
indicated
this
limit
has
suffered
a
very
marked
restriction
when
this
limit
of
capacity
in
a
given
force
is
passed
the
volume
of
commerce
will
not
affect
the
issue
and
seeing
how
low
that
capacity
must
be
in
the
future
and
how
enormous
is
the
volume
of
our
trade
the
limit
of
destructive
power
at
least
as
against
ourselves
provided
we
have
a
reasonably
system
of
defence
must
be
relatively
low
it
must
in
fact
be
passed
at
a
percentage
figure
well
within
what
we
have
easily
supported
in
the
past
there
is
reason
therefore
to
believe
that
so
far
from
the
assumption
in
question
being
true
the
effective
vulnerability
of
trade
is
not
in
direct
but
in
inverse
proportion
to
its
volume
in
other
words
the
greater
the
volume
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
make
an
effective
percentage
impression
similarly
it
will
be
observed
that
the
strain
of
trade
defence
was
proportioned
not
to
the
volume
of
that
trade
but
to
the
number
and
exposure
of
its
terminals
and
focal
points
whatever
the
volume
of
the
trade
these
remained
the
same
in
number
and
the
amount
of
force
required
for
their
defence
varied
only
with
the
strength
that
could
readily
be
brought
to
bear
against
them
it
varied
that
is
with
the
distribution
of
the
enemy
bases
and
the
amount
of
his
naval
force
thus
in
the
war
of
with
the
united
states
the
west
indian
and
north
american
areas
were
much
more
exposed
than
they
had
been
when
we
were
at
war
with
france
alone
and
when
american
ports
were
not
open
to
her
as
bases
they
became
vulnerable
not
only
to
the
united
states
fleet
but
also
in
a
much
higher
degree
to
that
of
france
and
consequently
the
force
we
found
necessary
to
devote
to
trade
defence
in
the
north
atlantic
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
naval
strength
of
the
new
belligerent
our
protective
force
had
to
be
increased
enormously
while
the
volume
of
our
trade
remained
precisely
the
same
this
relation
of
trade
defence
to
terminal
and
focal
areas
is
of
great
importance
for
it
is
in
the
increase
of
such
areas
in
the
far
east
that
lies
the
only
radical
change
in
the
problem
the
east
indian
seas
were
always
of
course
to
some
extent
treated
as
a
defended
area
but
the
problem
was
simplified
by
the
partial
survival
in
those
regions
of
the
old
method
of
defence
till
about
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
trade
was
expected
to
defend
itself
at
least
outside
the
home
area
and
the
retention
of
their
armament
by
east
indiamen
was
the
last
survival
of
the
practice
beyond
the
important
focal
area
of
helena
they
relied
mainly
on
their
own
power
of
resistance
or
to
such
escort
as
could
be
provided
by
the
relief
ships
of
the
east
indian
station
as
a
rule
their
escort
proper
went
no
farther
than
helena
whence
it
returned
with
the
vessels
that
gathered
there
from
india
china
and
the
south
sea
whaling
grounds
the
idea
of
the
system
was
to
provide
escort
for
that
part
of
the
great
route
which
was
exposed
to
attack
from
french
or
spanish
colonial
bases
on
the
african
coasts
and
in
the
adjacent
islands
for
obvious
reasons
this
system
would
have
to
be
reconsidered
in
the
future
the
expansion
of
the
great
european
powers
have
changed
the
conditions
for
which
it
sufficed
and
in
a
war
with
any
one
of
them
the
system
of
defended
terminal
and
focal
areas
would
require
a
great
extension
eastward
absorbing
an
appreciable
section
of
our
force
and
entailing
a
comparatively
weak
prolongation
of
our
chain
of
concentrations
here
then
we
must
mark
a
point
where
trade
defence
has
increased
in
difficulty
and
there
is
one
other
although
minor
hostile
bases
within
a
defended
area
have
lost
most
of
their
menace
to
trade
they
have
acquired
as
torpedo
bases
a
power
of
disturbing
the
defence
itself
so
long
as
such
bases
exist
with
a
potent
flotilla
within
them
it
is
obvious
that
the
actual
provision
for
defence
can
not
be
so
simple
a
matter
as
it
was
formerly
other
and
more
complex
arrangements
may
have
to
be
made
still
the
principle
of
defended
areas
seems
to
remain
unshaken
and
if
it
is
to
work
with
its
old
effectiveness
the
means
and
the
disposition
for
securing
those
areas
will
have
to
be
adapted
to
the
new
tactical
possibilities
the
old
strategical
conditions
so
far
as
can
be
seen
are
unaltered
except
in
so
far
as
the
reactions
of
modern
material
make
them
tell
in
favour
of
defence
rather
than
of
attack
if
we
desire
to
formulate
the
principles
on
which
this
conclusion
rests
we
shall
find
them
in
the
two
broad
rules
firstly
that
the
vulnerability
of
trade
is
in
inverse
ratio
to
its
volume
and
secondly
that
facility
of
attack
means
facility
of
defence
the
latter
which
was
always
true
receives
special
emphasis
from
modern
developments
facility
of
attack
means
the
power
of
exercising
control
for
exercise
of
control
we
require
not
only
numbers
but
also
speed
and
endurance
qualities
which
can
only
be
obtained
in
two
ways
it
must
be
at
the
cost
of
armour
and
armament
or
at
the
cost
of
increased
size
by
increasing
size
we
at
once
lose
numbers
if
by
sacrificing
armament
and
armour
we
seek
to
maintain
numbers
and
so
facilitate
attack
we
at
the
same
time
facilitate
defence
vessels
of
low
fighting
power
indeed
can
not
hope
to
operate
in
fertile
areas
without
support
to
overpower
the
defence
every
powerful
unit
detached
for
such
support
sets
free
a
unit
on
the
other
side
and
when
this
process
is
once
begun
there
is
no
supporting
units
to
be
effective
must
multiply
into
squadrons
and
sooner
or
later
the
inferior
power
seeking
to
substitute
commerce
destruction
for
the
clash
of
squadrons
will
have
squadronal
warfare
thrust
upon
him
provided
again
the
superior
power
adopts
a
reasonably
sound
system
of
defence
it
was
always
so
and
so
far
as
it
is
possible
to
penetrate
the
mists
which
veil
the
future
it
would
seem
that
with
higher
mobility
and
better
means
of
communication
the
squadronal
stage
must
be
reached
long
before
any
adequate
percentage
impression
can
have
been
made
by
the
sporadic
action
of
commerce
destroyers
ineffectual
as
such
warfare
has
always
been
in
the
past
until
a
general
command
has
been
established
its
prospects
in
the
future
judged
by
the
old
established
principles
are
less
promising
than
ever
finally
in
approaching
the
problem
of
trade
protection
and
especially
for
the
actual
determination
of
the
force
and
distribution
it
requires
there
is
a
dominant
limitation
to
be
kept
in
mind
by
no
conceivable
means
is
it
possible
to
give
trade
absolute
protection
we
can
not
make
an
omelette
without
breaking
eggs
we
can
not
make
war
without
losing
ships
to
aim
at
a
standard
of
naval
strength
or
a
strategical
distribution
which
would
make
our
trade
absolutely
invulnerable
is
to
march
to
economic
ruin
it
is
to
cripple
our
power
of
sustaining
war
to
a
successful
issue
and
to
seek
a
position
of
maritime
despotism
which
even
if
it
were
attainable
would
set
every
man
hand
against
us
all
these
evils
would
be
upon
us
and
our
goal
would
still
be
in
the
far
distance
in
the
second
naval
power
in
the
world
was
at
war
with
an
enemy
that
could
not
be
considered
a
naval
power
at
all
and
yet
she
lost
ships
by
capture
never
in
the
days
of
our
most
complete
domination
upon
the
seas
was
our
trade
invulnerable
and
it
never
can
be
to
seek
invulnerability
is
to
fall
into
the
strategical
vice
of
trying
to
be
superior
everywhere
to
forfeit
the
attainment
of
the
essential
for
fear
of
risking
the
unessential
to
base
our
plans
on
an
assumption
that
war
may
be
waged
without
loss
that
it
is
in
short
something
that
it
never
has
been
and
never
can
be
such
dreams
must
be
rigorously
abjured
our
standard
must
be
the
mean
of
economic
strength
the
line
which
on
the
one
hand
will
permit
us
to
nourish
our
financial
resources
for
the
evil
day
and
on
the
other
when
that
day
comes
will
deny
to
the
enemy
the
possibility
of
choking
our
financial
vigour
by
sufficiently
checking
the
flow
of
our
trade
iii
attack
defence
and
support
of
military
expeditions
the
attack
and
defence
of
oversea
expeditions
are
governed
in
a
large
measure
by
the
principles
of
attack
and
defence
of
trade
in
both
cases
it
is
a
question
of
control
of
communications
and
in
a
general
way
it
may
be
said
if
we
control
them
for
the
one
purpose
we
control
them
for
the
other
but
with
combined
expeditions
freedom
of
passage
is
not
the
only
consideration
the
duties
of
the
fleet
do
not
end
with
the
protection
of
the
troops
during
transit
as
in
the
case
of
convoys
unless
indeed
as
with
convoys
the
destination
is
a
friendly
country
in
the
normal
case
of
a
hostile
destination
where
resistance
is
to
be
expected
from
the
commencement
of
the
operations
the
fleet
is
charged
with
further
duties
of
a
most
exacting
kind
they
may
be
described
generally
as
duties
of
support
and
it
is
the
intrusion
of
these
duties
which
distinguish
the
naval
arrangements
for
combined
operations
most
sharply
from
those
for
the
protection
of
trade
except
for
this
consideration
there
need
be
no
difference
in
the
method
of
defence
in
each
case
the
strength
required
would
be
measured
by
the
dangers
of
interference
in
transit
but
as
it
is
that
standard
will
not
serve
for
combined
expeditions
for
however
small
those
risks
the
protective
arrangements
must
be
sufficiently
extensive
to
include
arrangements
for
support
before
dealing
with
this
the
most
complex
aspect
of
the
question
it
will
be
well
to
dismiss
attack
from
the
strategical
point
of
view
its
principles
differ
not
at
all
from
those
already
laid
down
for
active
resistance
of
invasion
whether
the
expedition
that
threatens
us
be
small
or
of
invasion
strength
the
cardinal
rule
has
always
been
that
the
transports
and
not
the
escort
must
be
the
primary
objective
of
the
fleet
the
escort
according
to
the
old
practice
must
be
turned
or
contained
but
never
treated
as
a
primary
objective
unless
both
turning
and
containing
prove
to
be
impracticable
it
is
needless
to
repeat
the
words
of
the
old
masters
in
which
this
principle
lies
embalmed
it
is
seldom
that
we
find
a
rule
of
naval
strategy
laid
down
in
precise
technical
terms
but
this
one
is
an
exception
in
the
old
squadronal
instructions
the
transports
of
the
enemy
are
to
be
your
principal
object
became
something
like
a
common
form
nor
did
this
rule
apply
only
to
cases
where
the
transports
were
protected
by
a
mere
escort
it
held
good
even
in
the
exceptional
cases
where
the
military
force
was
accompanied
or
guarded
by
the
whole
available
battle
strength
of
the
enemy
we
have
seen
how
in
norris
was
prepared
to
follow
the
french
transports
if
necessary
with
his
whole
force
and
how
in
nelson
organised
his
fleet
in
such
a
way
as
to
contain
rather
than
destroy
the
enemy
so
that
he
might
provide
for
an
overwhelming
attack
upon
the
transports
exceptions
to
this
as
to
all
strategical
rules
may
be
conceived
conditions
might
exist
in
which
if
the
enemy
accompanied
his
transports
it
would
be
worth
our
while
for
ulterior
objects
of
our
own
to
risk
the
escape
of
the
transports
in
order
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
destroying
the
fleet
but
even
in
such
a
case
the
distinction
would
be
little
more
than
academical
for
our
best
chance
of
securing
a
decisive
tactical
advantage
against
the
enemy
fleet
would
usually
be
to
compel
it
to
conform
to
our
movements
by
threatening
an
attack
on
the
transports
it
is
well
known
that
it
is
in
the
embarrassment
arising
from
the
presence
of
transports
that
lies
the
special
weakness
of
a
fleet
in
charge
of
them
there
is
however
one
condition
which
radically
differentiates
comparatively
small
expeditions
from
great
invasions
and
that
is
the
power
of
evasion
our
experience
has
proved
beyond
dispute
that
the
navy
alone
can
not
guarantee
defence
against
such
expeditions
it
can
not
be
sure
of
preventing
their
sailing
or
of
attacking
them
in
transit
and
this
is
especially
the
case
where
an
open
sea
gives
them
a
free
choice
of
route
as
in
the
case
of
the
french
expeditions
against
ireland
it
is
for
this
reason
that
although
an
adequate
navy
has
always
proved
sufficient
to
prevent
an
invasion
for
defence
against
expeditions
it
must
be
supplemented
by
a
home
army
to
perfect
our
defence
or
in
other
words
our
power
of
attack
such
an
army
must
be
adequate
to
ensure
that
all
expeditions
small
enough
to
evade
the
fleet
shall
do
no
effective
harm
when
they
land
if
in
numbers
training
organisation
and
distribution
it
is
adequate
for
this
purpose
an
enemy
can
not
hope
to
affect
the
issue
of
the
war
except
by
raising
his
expeditions
to
invasion
strength
and
so
finding
himself
involved
in
a
problem
that
no
one
has
ever
yet
solved
for
an
uncommanded
sea
still
even
for
expeditions
below
invasion
strength
the
navy
will
only
regard
the
army
as
a
second
line
and
its
strategy
must
provide
in
the
event
of
evasion
for
with
that
line
by
means
of
a
just
distribution
of
its
coastal
flotilla
it
will
provide
for
getting
contact
with
the
expedition
at
the
earliest
moment
after
its
destination
is
declared
it
will
press
the
principle
of
making
the
army
its
objective
to
the
utmost
limit
by
the
most
powerful
and
energetic
cruiser
pursuit
and
with
wireless
and
the
increased
ratio
of
cruiser
speed
such
pursuit
is
far
more
formidable
than
it
ever
was
no
expedition
nowadays
however
successful
its
evasion
can
be
guaranteed
against
naval
interruption
in
the
process
of
landing
still
less
can
it
be
guaranteed
against
naval
interference
in
its
rear
or
flanks
while
it
is
securing
its
front
against
the
home
army
it
may
seek
by
using
large
transports
to
reduce
their
number
and
secure
higher
speed
but
while
that
will
raise
its
chance
of
evasion
it
will
prolong
the
critical
period
of
landing
if
it
seek
by
using
smaller
transports
to
quicken
disembarkation
that
will
decrease
its
chances
of
evasion
by
lowering
its
speed
and
widening
the
sea
area
it
will
occupy
in
transit
all
the
modern
developments
in
fact
which
make
for
defence
in
case
of
invasion
over
an
uncommanded
sea
also
go
to
facilitate
timely
contact
with
an
expedition
seeking
to
operate
by
evasion
nor
must
it
be
forgotten
since
the
problem
is
a
combined
one
that
the
corresponding
developments
ashore
tell
with
little
less
force
in
favour
of
the
defending
army
such
appear
to
be
the
broad
principles
which
govern
an
enemy
attempts
to
act
with
combined
expeditions
in
our
own
waters
where
by
hypothesis
we
are
in
sufficient
naval
strength
to
deny
him
permanent
local
command
we
may
now
turn
to
the
larger
and
more
complex
question
of
the
conduct
of
such
expeditions
where
the
naval
conditions
are
reversed
by
the
conduct
be
it
remembered
we
mean
not
only
their
defence
but
also
their
support
and
for
this
reason
the
of
our
inquiry
is
to
be
found
as
above
indicated
in
the
contrast
of
combined
expeditions
with
convoys
a
convoy
consists
of
two
elements
a
fleet
of
merchantmen
and
an
escort
but
a
combined
expedition
does
not
consist
simply
of
an
army
and
a
squadron
it
is
an
organism
at
once
more
complex
and
more
homogeneous
its
constitution
is
fourfold
there
is
firstly
the
army
secondly
the
transports
and
landing
flotilla
that
is
the
flotilla
of
and
steamboats
for
towing
them
all
of
which
may
be
carried
in
the
transports
or
accompany
them
thirdly
the
squadron
in
charge
of
transports
as
it
came
to
be
called
which
includes
the
escort
proper
and
the
supporting
flotilla
of
lighter
craft
for
inshore
work
and
lastly
the
covering
squadron
such
at
least
is
a
combined
expedition
in
logical
analysis
but
so
essentially
is
it
a
single
organism
that
in
practice
these
various
elements
can
seldom
be
kept
sharply
distinct
they
may
be
interwoven
in
the
most
intricate
manner
indeed
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
each
will
always
have
to
discharge
some
of
the
functions
of
the
others
thus
the
covering
squadron
may
not
only
be
indistinguishable
from
the
escort
and
support
but
it
will
often
provide
the
greater
part
of
the
landing
flotilla
and
even
a
portion
of
the
landing
force
similarly
the
escort
may
also
serve
as
transport
and
provide
in
part
not
only
the
supporting
force
but
also
the
landing
flotilla
the
fourfold
constitution
is
therefore
in
a
great
measure
theoretical
still
its
use
is
not
merely
that
it
serves
to
define
the
varied
functions
which
the
fleet
will
have
to
discharge
as
we
proceed
it
will
be
seen
to
have
a
practical
strategical
value
from
a
naval
point
of
view
it
is
the
covering
squadron
which
calls
first
for
consideration
because
of
the
emphasis
with
which
its
necessity
marks
not
only
the
distinction
between
the
conduct
of
combined
expeditions
and
the
conduct
of
commercial
convoys
but
also
the
fact
that
such
expeditions
are
actually
a
combined
force
and
not
merely
an
army
escorted
by
a
fleet
in
our
system
of
commerce
protection
the
covering
squadron
had
no
place
the
as
we
have
seen
was
employed
in
holding
definite
terminal
areas
and
had
no
organic
connection
with
the
convoys
the
convoys
had
no
further
protection
than
their
own
escort
and
the
reinforcements
that
met
them
as
they
approached
the
terminal
areas
but
where
a
convoy
of
transports
forming
part
of
a
combined
expedition
was
destined
for
an
enemy
country
and
would
have
to
overcome
resistance
by
true
combined
operations
a
covering
was
always
provided
in
the
case
of
distant
objectives
it
might
be
that
the
covering
squadron
was
not
attached
till
the
whole
expedition
assembled
in
the
theatre
of
operations
during
transit
to
that
theatre
the
transports
might
have
commerce
protection
escort
only
but
once
the
operations
began
from
the
point
of
concentration
a
covering
squadron
was
always
in
touch
it
was
only
where
the
destination
of
the
troops
was
a
friendly
country
and
the
line
of
passage
was
well
protected
by
our
permanent
blockades
that
a
covering
squadron
could
be
dispensed
with
altogether
thus
our
various
expeditions
for
the
assistance
of
portugal
were
treated
exactly
like
commercial
convoys
but
in
such
cases
as
wolfe
expedition
to
quebec
or
amherst
to
louisburg
or
indeed
any
of
those
which
were
continually
launched
against
the
west
indies
a
was
always
provided
as
an
integral
part
in
the
theatre
of
operations
our
arrangements
in
the
crimean
war
illustrate
the
point
exactly
our
troops
were
sent
out
at
first
to
land
at
gallipoli
in
a
friendly
territory
and
to
act
within
that
territory
as
an
army
of
observation
it
was
not
a
true
combined
expedition
and
the
transports
were
given
no
covering
squadron
their
passage
was
sufficiently
covered
by
our
channel
and
mediterranean
fleets
occupying
the
exits
of
the
baltic
and
the
black
sea
but
so
soon
as
the
original
war
plan
proved
ineffective
and
combined
offensive
operations
against
sebastopol
were
decided
on
the
mediterranean
fleet
lost
its
independent
character
and
thenceforth
its
paramount
function
was
to
furnish
a
covering
squadron
in
touch
with
the
troops
seeing
how
important
are
the
support
duties
of
such
a
force
the
term
covering
squadron
may
seem
to
describe
it
but
it
is
adopted
for
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
it
was
the
one
employed
officially
in
our
service
on
the
last
mentioned
occasion
which
was
our
last
great
combined
expedition
in
preparing
the
descent
on
the
crimea
sir
edmund
lyons
who
was
acting
as
chief
of
the
staff
to
sir
james
dundas
and
had
charge
of
the
combined
operations
organised
the
fleet
into
a
covering
squadron
and
a
squadron
in
charge
of
transports
in
the
second
place
the
designation
serves
to
emphasise
what
is
its
main
and
primary
function
for
important
as
it
is
to
keep
in
mind
its
support
duties
they
must
not
be
permitted
to
overshadow
the
fact
that
its
paramount
function
is
to
prevent
interference
with
the
actual
combined
operations
that
is
the
landing
support
and
supply
of
the
army
thus
in
when
shovel
and
peterborough
were
operating
against
barcelona
shovel
was
covering
the
amphibious
siege
from
the
french
squadron
in
toulon
peterborough
required
the
assistance
of
the
marines
ashore
to
execute
a
de
and
shovel
only
consented
to
land
them
on
the
express
understanding
that
the
moment
his
cruisers
passed
the
signal
that
the
toulon
squadron
was
putting
to
sea
they
would
have
to
be
recalled
to
the
fleet
no
matter
what
the
state
of
the
land
operations
and
to
this
peterborough
agreed
the
principle
involved
it
will
be
seen
is
precisely
that
which
lyons
term
covering
squadron
embodies
to
quote
anything
that
happened
in
the
crimean
war
as
a
precedent
without
such
traditional
support
will
scarcely
appear
convincing
in
our
british
way
we
have
fostered
a
legend
that
so
far
as
organisation
and
staff
work
were
concerned
that
war
was
nothing
but
a
collection
of
deterrent
examples
but
in
truth
as
a
combined
operation
its
opening
movement
both
in
conception
and
organisation
was
perhaps
the
most
daring
brilliant
and
successful
thing
of
the
kind
we
ever
did
designed
as
the
expedition
was
to
assist
an
ally
in
his
own
country
it
was
suddenly
called
upon
without
any
previous
preparation
to
undertake
a
combined
operation
of
the
most
difficult
kind
against
the
territory
of
a
enemy
it
involved
a
landing
late
in
the
year
on
an
open
and
stormy
coast
within
striking
distance
of
a
naval
fortress
which
contained
an
army
of
unknown
strength
and
a
fleet
not
much
inferior
in
battle
power
and
undefeated
it
was
an
operation
comparable
to
the
capture
of
louisburg
and
the
landing
of
the
japanese
in
the
liaotung
peninsula
but
the
conditions
were
far
more
difficult
both
those
operations
had
been
rehearsed
a
few
years
previously
and
they
had
been
long
prepared
on
the
fullest
knowledge
in
the
crimea
everything
was
in
the
dark
even
steam
was
an
unproved
element
and
everything
had
to
be
improvised
the
french
had
practically
to
demobilise
their
fleet
to
supply
transport
and
so
hazardous
did
the
enterprise
appear
that
they
resisted
its
being
undertaken
with
every
military
argument
we
had
in
fact
besides
all
the
other
difficulties
to
carry
an
unwilling
ally
upon
our
backs
yet
it
was
accomplished
and
so
far
at
least
as
the
naval
part
was
concerned
the
methods
which
achieved
success
mark
the
culmination
of
all
we
had
learnt
in
three
centuries
of
rich
experience
the
first
of
the
lessons
was
that
for
operations
in
uncommanded
or
imperfectly
commanded
seas
there
was
need
of
a
covering
squadron
differentiated
from
the
squadron
in
charge
of
transports
its
main
function
was
to
secure
the
necessary
local
command
whether
for
transit
or
for
the
actual
operations
but
as
a
rule
transit
was
secured
by
our
regular
blockading
squadrons
and
generally
the
covering
squadron
only
assembled
in
the
theatre
of
operations
when
therefore
the
theatre
was
within
a
defended
terminal
area
as
in
our
descents
upon
the
northern
and
atlantic
coasts
of
france
then
the
terminal
defence
squadron
was
usually
also
sufficient
to
protect
the
actual
operations
it
thus
formed
automatically
the
covering
squadron
and
either
continued
its
blockade
or
as
in
the
case
of
our
attack
on
malo
in
took
up
a
position
between
the
enemy
squadron
and
the
expedition
line
of
operation
if
however
the
theatre
of
operation
was
not
within
a
terminal
area
or
lay
within
a
distant
one
that
was
weakly
held
the
expedition
was
given
its
own
covering
squadron
in
which
the
local
squadron
was
more
or
less
completely
merged
whatever
in
fact
was
necessary
to
secure
the
local
control
was
done
though
as
we
have
seen
and
must
presently
consider
more
fully
this
necessity
was
not
always
the
standard
by
which
the
strength
of
the
covering
squadron
was
measured
the
strength
of
the
covering
squadron
being
determined
the
next
question
is
the
position
or
tract
which
it
should
occupy
like
most
other
strategical
problems
it
is
an
option
of
difficulties
in
so
far
as
the
squadron
is
designed
for
support
that
is
support
from
its
men
boats
and
guns
it
will
be
desirable
to
station
it
as
near
as
possible
to
the
objective
but
as
a
covering
squadron
with
the
duty
of
preventing
the
intrusion
of
an
enemy
force
it
should
be
as
far
away
as
possible
so
as
to
engage
such
a
force
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
of
its
attempt
to
interfere
there
is
also
the
paramount
necessity
that
its
position
must
be
such
that
favourable
contact
with
the
enemy
is
certain
if
he
tries
to
interrupt
usually
such
certainty
is
only
to
be
found
either
in
touch
with
the
enemy
naval
base
or
in
touch
with
your
own
landing
force
where
the
objective
is
the
local
naval
base
of
the
enemy
these
two
points
of
course
tend
to
be
identical
strategically
and
the
position
of
the
covering
squadron
becomes
a
tactical
rather
than
a
strategical
question
but
the
vital
principle
of
an
independent
existence
holds
good
and
no
matter
how
great
the
necessity
of
support
the
covering
squadron
should
never
be
so
deeply
engaged
with
the
landing
force
as
to
be
unable
to
disentangle
itself
for
action
as
a
purely
naval
unit
in
time
to
discharge
its
naval
function
in
other
words
it
must
always
be
able
to
act
in
the
same
way
as
a
free
field
army
covering
a
siege
where
the
objective
of
the
expedition
is
not
the
local
naval
base
the
choice
of
a
position
for
the
covering
squadron
will
turn
mainly
on
the
amount
of
support
which
the
army
is
likely
to
require
if
it
can
not
act
by
surprise
and
serious
military
resistance
is
consequently
to
be
expected
or
where
the
coast
defences
are
too
strong
for
the
transport
squadron
to
overpower
then
the
scale
will
incline
to
a
position
close
to
the
army
though
the
extent
to
which
under
modern
conditions
ships
at
sea
can
usefully
perform
the
delicate
operation
of
supporting
an
infantry
attack
with
gun
fire
except
by
enfilading
the
enemy
position
remains
to
be
proved
a
similar
choice
will
be
indicated
where
strong
support
of
men
and
boats
is
required
as
when
a
sufficiency
of
and
steam
towage
can
not
be
provided
by
the
transports
and
their
attendant
squadron
or
again
where
the
locality
is
such
that
amphibious
operations
beyond
the
actual
landing
are
likely
to
be
called
for
and
the
assistance
of
a
large
number
of
boats
and
seamen
acting
with
the
army
is
necessary
to
give
it
the
amphibious
tactical
mobility
which
it
would
otherwise
lack
such
cases
occurred
at
quebec
in
where
saunders
took
his
covering
right
up
the
lawrence
although
its
covering
functions
could
have
been
discharged
even
better
by
a
position
several
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
the
objective
and
again
in
at
alexandria
where
lord
keith
ran
the
extremest
hazard
to
his
covering
functions
in
order
to
undertake
the
supply
of
general
abercromby
army
by
inland
waters
and
give
him
the
mobility
he
required
if
on
the
other
hand
the
transport
squadron
is
able
to
furnish
all
the
support
necessary
the
covering
squadron
will
take
station
as
close
as
possible
to
the
enemy
naval
base
and
there
it
will
operate
according
to
the
ordinary
laws
of
blockade
if
nothing
is
desired
but
to
prevent
interference
its
guard
will
take
the
form
of
a
close
blockade
but
if
there
be
a
subsidiary
purpose
of
using
the
expedition
as
a
means
of
forcing
the
enemy
to
sea
the
open
form
will
be
employed
as
for
instance
in
anson
case
above
cited
when
he
covered
the
malo
expedition
not
by
closely
blockading
brest
but
by
taking
a
position
to
the
eastward
at
the
isle
de
batz
in
the
japanese
operations
against
manchuria
and
the
kuantung
peninsula
these
old
principles
displayed
themselves
in
undiminished
vitality
in
the
surprise
descents
against
seoul
and
at
takusan
the
work
of
support
was
left
entirely
with
the
transport
squadron
while
admiral
togo
took
up
a
covering
position
far
away
at
port
arthur
the
two
elements
of
the
fleet
were
kept
separate
all
through
but
in
the
operations
for
the
isolation
and
subsequent
siege
of
port
arthur
they
were
so
closely
united
as
to
appear
frequently
indistinguishable
still
so
far
as
the
closeness
of
the
landing
place
to
the
objective
permitted
the
two
acted
independently
for
the
actual
landing
of
the
second
army
the
boats
of
the
covering
squadron
were
used
but
it
remained
a
live
naval
unit
all
through
and
was
never
organically
mingled
with
the
transport
squadron
its
operations
throughout
were
so
far
as
modern
conditions
permit
on
the
lines
of
a
close
blockade
to
prevent
interference
was
its
paramount
function
undisturbed
so
far
as
we
are
able
to
judge
by
any
subsidiary
purpose
of
bringing
the
enemy
to
decisive
action
all
through
the
operations
however
there
was
a
new
influence
which
tended
to
confuse
the
precision
of
the
old
methods
needless
to
say
it
was
the
torpedo
and
the
mine
their
deflective
pressure
was
curious
and
interesting
in
our
own
operations
against
sebastopol
to
which
the
port
arthur
case
is
most
closely
comparable
the
old
rules
still
held
good
on
the
traditional
principle
dating
from
drake
attack
on
san
domingo
in
a
landing
place
was
chosen
which
gave
the
mean
between
facility
for
a
de
and
freedom
from
opposition
that
is
it
was
chosen
at
the
nearest
practicable
point
to
the
objective
which
was
undefended
by
batteries
and
out
of
reach
of
the
enemy
main
army
in
the
handling
of
the
covering
squadron
admiral
dundas
the
gave
it
its
dual
function
after
explaining
the
constitution
of
the
transport
squadron
he
says
the
remainder
of
my
force
will
act
as
a
covering
squadron
and
where
practicable
assist
in
the
general
disembarkation
with
these
two
objects
in
mind
he
took
a
station
near
enough
to
the
landing
place
to
support
the
army
with
his
guns
if
it
were
opposed
but
still
in
sight
of
his
cruisers
before
sebastopol
and
at
such
a
distance
that
at
the
first
sign
of
the
russians
moving
he
would
have
time
to
get
before
the
port
and
engage
them
before
they
could
get
well
to
sea
that
is
he
took
a
position
as
near
to
the
army
as
was
compatible
with
preventing
interference
or
it
may
be
said
his
position
was
as
near
to
the
enemy
base
as
was
compatible
with
supporting
the
landing
from
either
aspect
in
fact
the
position
was
the
same
and
its
choice
presented
no
complexity
owing
mainly
to
the
fact
that
for
the
first
time
steam
simplified
the
factors
of
time
and
distance
in
the
japanese
case
the
application
of
these
principles
was
not
so
easy
in
selecting
the
nearest
undefended
point
for
a
landing
it
was
not
only
batteries
or
even
the
army
in
port
arthur
or
the
troops
dispersed
in
the
liaotung
peninsula
that
had
to
be
considered
but
rather
as
must
always
be
the
case
in
the
future
mines
and
mobile
torpedo
defence
the
point
they
chose
was
the
nearest
practicable
bay
that
was
unmined
it
was
not
strictly
out
of
mobile
defence
range
but
it
so
happened
that
it
lay
behind
islands
which
lent
themselves
to
the
creation
of
fixed
defences
and
thus
it
fulfilled
all
the
recognised
conditions
but
in
so
far
as
the
defences
could
be
turned
by
the
russian
fleet
a
covering
squadron
was
necessary
and
the
difficulty
of
choosing
a
position
for
it
was
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
objective
of
the
combined
operations
was
not
merely
port
arthur
itself
but
also
the
squadron
it
contained
it
was
necessary
therefore
not
only
to
hold
off
that
squadron
but
to
prevent
its
escape
this
indicated
a
close
blockade
but
for
close
blockade
a
position
out
of
night
torpedo
range
is
necessary
and
the
nearest
point
where
such
a
position
could
be
secured
was
behind
the
defences
that
covered
the
disembarkation
consequently
in
spite
of
what
the
strategical
conditions
dictated
the
covering
squadron
was
more
or
less
continuously
forced
back
upon
the
army
and
its
supporting
force
even
when
the
support
of
the
was
no
longer
required
in
the
conditions
that
existed
nothing
was
lost
for
the
lines
of
the
japanese
fixed
defences
were
so
near
to
the
enemy
base
that
by
mining
the
entrance
of
the
port
admiral
togo
ensured
that
the
enemy
exit
would
be
slow
enough
for
him
to
be
certain
of
getting
contact
from
his
defended
anchorage
before
the
russians
could
get
far
to
sea
what
would
happen
in
a
case
when
no
such
position
could
be
secured
is
another
matter
the
landing
place
and
supply
base
of
the
army
must
be
secured
against
torpedo
attack
and
the
principle
of
concentration
of
effort
would
suggest
that
the
means
of
defence
should
not
be
attenuated
by
providing
the
covering
squadron
with
a
defended
anchorage
elsewhere
thus
it
would
appear
that
unless
the
geographical
conditions
permit
the
covering
squadron
to
use
one
of
its
own
national
bases
the
drift
of
recent
developments
will
be
to
force
it
back
on
the
army
and
thus
tend
to
confuse
its
duties
with
those
of
the
transport
squadron
hence
the
increased
importance
of
keeping
clear
the
difference
in
function
between
the
two
squadrons
to
emphasise
the
principle
of
the
covering
squadron
these
two
cases
may
be
contrasted
with
the
lissa
episode
at
the
end
of
the
war
of
in
that
case
it
was
entirely
neglected
with
disastrous
results
the
austrian
admiral
tegethoff
with
an
inferior
fleet
had
by
higher
order
been
acting
throughout
on
the
defensive
and
was
still
in
pola
waiting
for
a
chance
of
a
persano
with
the
superior
italian
fleet
was
at
ancona
where
he
practically
dominated
the
adriatic
in
july
the
italians
owing
to
the
failure
of
the
army
were
confronted
with
the
prospect
of
being
forced
to
make
peace
on
unfavourable
terms
to
improve
the
position
persano
was
ordered
to
take
possession
of
the
austrian
island
of
lissa
without
any
attempt
to
organise
his
fleet
on
the
orthodox
british
principle
he
proceeded
to
conduct
the
operation
with
his
entire
force
practically
the
whole
of
it
became
involved
in
amphibious
work
and
as
soon
as
persano
was
thus
committed
tegethoff
put
to
sea
and
surprised
him
persano
was
unable
to
disentangle
a
sufficient
force
in
time
to
meet
the
attack
and
having
no
compact
squadron
fit
for
independent
naval
action
he
was
decisively
defeated
by
the
inferior
enemy
according
to
british
practice
it
was
clearly
a
case
where
if
the
operation
were
to
be
undertaken
at
all
an
independent
covering
squadron
should
have
been
told
off
either
to
hold
tegethoff
in
pola
or
to
bring
him
to
timely
action
according
to
whether
the
island
or
the
austrian
fleet
was
the
primary
objective
the
reason
it
was
not
done
may
be
that
persano
was
not
given
a
proper
landing
force
and
he
seems
to
have
considered
that
the
whole
strength
of
his
fleet
was
needed
for
the
successful
seizure
of
the
objective
if
so
it
is
only
one
more
proof
of
the
rule
that
no
matter
what
fleet
support
the
landing
operations
may
require
it
should
never
be
given
in
an
imperfectly
commanded
sea
to
an
extent
which
will
deny
the
possibility
of
a
covering
squadron
being
left
free
for
independent
naval
action
the
length
to
which
the
supporting
functions
of
the
fleet
may
be
carried
will
always
be
a
delicate
question
the
suggestion
that
its
strength
must
be
affected
by
the
need
of
the
army
for
the
men
of
the
fleet
or
its
boats
which
imply
its
men
as
well
will
appear
heretical
a
we
say
is
intended
to
deal
with
the
enemy
and
its
men
to
fight
the
ships
and
the
mind
revolts
at
the
idea
of
the
strength
of
a
squadron
being
fixed
by
any
other
standard
theoretically
nothing
can
seem
more
true
but
it
is
an
idea
of
peace
and
the
study
the
atmosphere
of
war
engendered
a
wider
and
more
practical
view
the
men
of
the
old
wars
knew
that
when
a
squadron
is
attached
to
a
combined
expedition
it
is
something
different
from
a
purely
naval
unit
they
knew
moreover
that
an
army
acting
oversea
against
hostile
territory
is
an
incomplete
organism
incapable
of
striking
its
blow
in
the
most
effective
manner
without
the
assistance
of
the
men
of
the
fleet
it
was
the
office
then
of
the
naval
portion
of
the
force
not
only
to
defend
the
striking
part
of
the
organism
but
to
complete
its
deficiencies
and
lend
it
the
power
to
strike
alone
and
unaided
the
army
can
not
depend
on
getting
itself
ashore
it
can
not
supply
itself
it
can
not
secure
its
retreat
nor
can
it
avail
itself
of
the
highest
advantages
of
an
amphibious
force
the
sudden
shift
of
base
or
line
of
operation
these
things
the
fleet
must
do
for
it
and
it
must
do
them
with
its
men
the
japanese
in
the
late
war
attempted
to
do
this
work
by
means
of
a
highly
organized
army
disembarkation
staff
but
except
in
perfect
conditions
of
weather
and
locality
it
does
not
seem
to
have
worked
well
and
in
almost
all
cases
the
assistance
of
the
navy
was
called
in
the
authority
for
this
view
is
abundant
in
for
instance
when
general
maitland
was
charged
with
an
expedition
against
belleisle
he
was
invited
to
state
what
naval
force
he
would
require
he
found
it
difficult
to
fix
with
precision
speaking
loosely
however
he
wrote
three
or
four
sail
of
the
line
and
four
or
five
active
frigates
appear
to
me
to
be
properly
adequate
to
the
proposed
service
the
frigates
to
blockade
meaning
of
course
to
blockade
the
objective
and
prevent
reinforcements
reaching
it
from
the
mainland
always
one
of
the
supporting
functions
of
the
squadron
attached
to
the
transports
the
ships
he
adds
to
furnish
us
with
the
number
of
men
necessary
for
land
operations
in
this
case
our
permanent
blockading
squadrons
supplied
the
cover
and
what
maitland
meant
was
that
the
battleships
he
asked
for
were
to
be
added
to
the
transport
squadron
not
as
being
required
for
escort
but
for
support
vincent
who
was
then
first
lord
not
only
endorsed
his
request
but
gave
him
for
disembarkation
work
one
more
than
he
had
asked
for
at
this
time
our
general
command
of
the
sea
had
been
very
fully
secured
and
we
had
plenty
of
naval
force
to
spare
for
its
exercise
it
will
be
well
to
compare
it
with
a
case
in
which
the
circumstances
were
different
when
in
the
expedition
under
admiral
christian
and
general
abercromby
was
being
prepared
for
the
west
indies
the
admiral
in
concert
with
jervis
drew
up
a
memorandum
as
to
the
naval
force
required
the
force
he
asked
for
was
considerable
both
he
and
jervis
considered
that
the
escort
and
local
cover
must
be
very
strong
because
it
was
impossible
to
count
on
closing
either
brest
or
toulon
effectually
by
blockade
but
this
was
not
the
only
reason
the
plan
of
operations
involved
three
distinct
landings
and
each
would
require
at
least
two
of
the
line
and
perhaps
three
not
only
as
protection
but
as
the
means
by
which
must
be
manned
cannon
landed
and
the
other
necessary
services
of
fatigue
executed
christian
also
required
the
necessary
frigates
and
three
or
four
brigs
to
cover
that
is
support
the
operations
of
the
smaller
vessels
that
is
the
landing
flotillas
doing
inshore
work
the
main
attack
would
require
at
least
four
of
the
line
and
seven
frigates
with
brigs
and
schooners
in
proportion
in
all
he
considered
the
the
frigates
being
otherwise
employed
would
have
to
provide
landing
parties
to
the
number
of
men
for
the
landing
and
moving
guns
water
and
provisions
and
this
would
be
their
daily
task
the
military
force
these
landing
parties
were
to
serve
amounted
to
about
men
sir
hugh
cloberry
christian
was
an
officer
of
high
distinction
with
a
remarkable
record
of
battle
service
he
had
been
serving
as
second
captain
just
before
his
promotion
to
flag
rank
in
and
died
as
at
the
cape
at
the
early
age
of
lord
barham
it
must
be
said
who
as
sir
charles
middleton
was
then
first
sea
lord
objected
to
the
requirements
as
excessive
particularly
in
the
demand
for
a
strong
escort
as
he
considered
that
the
transit
could
be
safeguarded
by
special
vigilance
on
the
part
of
the
permanent
blockading
squadrons
the
need
for
large
shore
parties
he
seems
to
have
ignored
his
opinion
however
is
not
quite
convincing
for
from
the
first
he
had
taken
up
an
antagonistic
attitude
to
the
whole
idea
of
the
expedition
he
regarded
the
policy
which
dictated
it
as
radically
unsound
and
was
naturally
anxious
to
restrict
the
force
that
was
to
be
spent
upon
it
his
opposition
was
based
on
the
broad
and
principles
that
were
characteristic
of
his
strategy
he
believed
that
in
view
of
the
threatening
attitude
of
spain
the
right
course
was
to
husband
the
navy
so
as
to
bring
it
up
to
a
standard
for
the
coming
struggle
and
to
keep
it
concentrated
for
decisive
naval
action
the
moment
spain
showed
her
hand
in
short
he
stoutly
condemned
a
policy
which
entailed
a
serious
dissipation
of
naval
force
for
a
secondary
object
before
a
working
command
of
the
sea
had
been
secured
it
was
in
fact
the
arrangements
for
this
expedition
which
forced
him
to
resign
before
the
preparations
were
complete
but
it
is
to
be
observed
that
his
objections
to
the
plan
were
really
due
not
to
the
principle
of
its
organisation
but
to
our
having
insufficient
force
to
give
it
adequate
naval
support
without
prejudicing
the
higher
consideration
of
our
whole
position
at
sea
on
analogous
grounds
almost
every
military
critic
has
condemned
the
policy
of
this
disastrous
expedition
as
involving
a
dispersal
of
our
slender
military
force
at
a
time
when
everything
called
for
its
concentration
in
europe
it
is
obvious
that
the
foregoing
considerations
beyond
the
strategical
reactions
already
noted
will
have
another
of
the
first
importance
in
that
they
must
influence
the
choice
of
a
landing
place
the
interest
of
the
army
will
always
be
to
fix
it
as
near
to
the
objective
as
is
compatible
with
an
unopposed
landing
the
ideal
was
one
night
march
but
this
could
rarely
be
attained
except
in
the
case
of
very
small
expeditions
which
could
be
landed
rapidly
at
the
close
of
day
and
advance
in
the
dark
in
larger
expeditions
the
aim
was
to
effect
the
landing
far
enough
from
the
objective
to
prevent
the
garrison
of
the
place
or
the
enemy
local
forces
offering
opposition
before
a
footing
was
secured
the
tendency
of
the
navy
will
usually
be
in
the
opposite
direction
for
normally
the
further
they
can
land
the
army
away
from
the
enemy
strength
the
surer
are
they
of
being
able
to
protect
it
against
naval
interference
their
ideal
will
be
a
place
far
enough
away
to
be
out
of
torpedo
range
and
to
enable
them
to
work
the
covering
and
the
transport
squadron
in
sound
strategical
independence
to
reduce
these
divergencies
to
a
mean
of
efficiency
some
kind
of
joint
staff
is
necessary
and
to
ensure
its
smooth
working
it
is
no
less
desirable
to
ascertain
so
far
as
possible
the
principles
and
method
on
which
it
should
proceed
in
the
best
recent
precedents
the
process
has
been
for
the
army
staff
to
present
the
limits
of
within
which
the
landing
must
take
place
for
the
operation
to
have
the
desired
effect
and
to
indicate
the
known
practicable
landing
points
in
the
order
they
would
prefer
them
it
will
then
be
for
the
naval
staff
to
say
how
nearly
in
accordance
with
the
views
of
the
army
they
are
prepared
to
act
their
decision
will
turn
on
the
difficulties
of
protection
and
the
essentials
of
a
landing
place
from
the
point
of
view
of
weather
currents
beach
and
the
like
and
also
in
a
secondary
measure
upon
the
extent
to
which
the
conformation
of
the
coast
will
permit
of
tactical
support
by
and
feints
if
the
naval
staff
are
unwilling
to
agree
to
the
point
or
points
their
colleagues
most
desire
a
question
of
balance
of
risk
is
set
up
which
the
higher
joint
staff
must
adjust
it
will
be
the
duty
of
the
naval
staff
to
set
out
frankly
and
clearly
all
the
sea
risks
the
proposal
of
the
army
entails
and
if
possible
to
suggest
an
alternative
by
which
the
risk
of
naval
interference
can
be
lessened
without
laying
too
heavy
a
burden
on
the
army
balancing
these
risks
against
those
stated
by
the
army
the
superior
staff
must
decide
which
line
is
to
be
taken
and
each
service
then
will
do
its
best
to
minimise
the
difficulties
it
has
to
face
whether
the
superior
staff
will
incline
to
the
naval
or
the
military
view
will
depend
upon
whether
the
greater
danger
likely
to
be
incurred
is
from
the
sea
or
on
land
where
the
naval
conditions
are
fairly
well
known
the
line
of
operations
can
be
fixed
in
this
way
with
much
precision
but
if
as
usually
happens
the
probable
action
of
the
enemy
at
sea
can
not
be
divined
with
sufficient
approximation
then
assuming
there
is
serious
possibility
of
naval
interference
the
final
choice
within
the
limited
area
must
be
left
to
the
admiral
the
practice
has
been
to
give
him
instructions
which
define
in
order
of
merit
the
points
the
army
desire
and
direct
him
to
select
the
one
which
in
the
circumstances
as
he
finds
them
he
considers
within
reasonable
risk
of
war
similarly
if
the
danger
of
naval
interference
be
small
and
the
local
conditions
ashore
imperfectly
known
the
final
choice
will
be
with
the
general
subject
only
to
the
practicable
possibilities
of
the
landing
place
he
would
choose
during
the
best
period
of
our
old
wars
there
was
seldom
any
difficulty
in
making
things
work
smoothly
on
these
lines
after
the
first
inglorious
failure
at
rochefort
in
the
practice
was
where
discretion
of
this
kind
had
been
allowed
for
the
two
to
make
a
joint
in
the
same
boat
and
settle
the
matter
amicably
on
the
spot
it
was
on
these
lines
the
conduct
of
our
combined
operations
was
always
arranged
thenceforth
since
the
elder
pitt
time
it
has
never
been
our
practice
to
place
combined
expeditions
under
either
a
naval
or
a
military
and
allow
him
to
decide
between
naval
and
military
exigencies
the
danger
of
possible
friction
between
two
came
to
be
regarded
as
small
compared
with
the
danger
of
a
single
one
making
mistakes
through
unfamiliarity
with
the
limitations
of
the
service
to
which
he
does
not
belong
the
system
has
usually
worked
well
even
when
questions
arose
which
were
essentially
questions
for
a
joint
superior
staff
the
exceptions
indeed
are
very
few
a
fine
example
of
how
such
difficulties
can
be
settled
when
the
spirit
is
willing
occurred
in
the
crimea
the
naval
difficulties
as
we
have
already
seen
were
as
formidable
as
they
could
well
be
short
of
rendering
the
whole
attempt
madness
when
it
came
to
the
point
of
execution
a
joint
council
of
war
was
held
at
which
sat
the
allied
staffs
of
both
services
so
great
were
the
differences
of
opinion
between
the
french
and
british
generals
and
so
imperfectly
was
the
terrain
known
that
they
could
not
indicate
a
landing
place
with
any
precision
all
the
admirals
knew
was
that
it
must
be
on
an
open
coast
which
they
had
not
been
able
to
reconnoitre
where
the
weather
might
at
any
time
interrupt
communications
with
the
shore
and
where
they
were
liable
to
be
attacked
by
a
force
which
until
their
own
ships
were
cleared
of
troops
would
not
be
inferior
all
these
objections
they
laid
before
the
council
general
lord
raglan
then
said
the
army
now
perfectly
understood
the
risk
and
was
prepared
to
take
it
whereupon
the
allied
admirals
replied
that
they
were
ready
to
proceed
and
do
their
best
to
set
the
army
ashore
and
support
it
at
any
point
that
should
be
chosen
there
remains
a
form
of
support
which
has
not
yet
been
considered
and
that
is
diversionary
movements
or
feints
by
the
fleet
to
draw
the
attention
away
from
the
landing
place
this
will
naturally
be
a
function
of
the
covering
or
its
attendant
cruisers
and
flotilla
the
device
appears
in
drake
attack
on
san
domingo
in
an
attack
which
may
be
regarded
as
our
earliest
precedent
in
modern
times
and
as
the
pattern
to
which
all
subsequent
operations
of
the
kind
conformed
so
far
as
circumstances
allowed
in
that
case
while
drake
landed
the
troops
a
night
march
from
the
place
the
bulk
of
the
fleet
moved
before
it
kept
it
in
alarm
all
night
and
at
dawn
made
a
demonstration
with
the
boats
of
forcing
a
direct
landing
under
cover
of
its
guns
the
result
was
the
garrison
moved
out
to
meet
the
threat
and
were
surprised
in
flank
by
the
real
landing
force
passing
from
this
simple
case
to
the
most
elaborate
in
our
annals
we
find
saunders
doing
the
same
thing
at
quebec
in
preparation
for
wolfe
night
landing
he
made
a
show
of
arrangements
for
a
bombardment
of
montcalm
lines
below
the
city
and
in
the
morning
with
the
boats
of
the
fleet
began
a
demonstration
of
landing
his
marines
by
this
device
he
held
montcalm
away
from
wolfe
landing
place
till
a
secure
footing
had
been
obtained
similar
demonstrations
had
been
made
above
the
city
and
the
combined
result
was
that
wolfe
was
able
to
penetrate
the
centre
of
the
french
position
unopposed
such
work
belongs
of
course
to
the
region
of
tactics
rather
than
of
strategy
but
the
device
has
been
used
with
equal
effect
strategically
so
great
is
the
secrecy
as
well
as
the
mobility
of
an
amphibious
force
that
it
is
extremely
difficult
for
an
enemy
to
distinguish
a
real
attack
from
a
feint
even
at
the
last
moment
when
a
landing
is
actually
in
progress
it
is
impossible
for
the
defenders
to
tell
that
all
the
troops
are
being
landed
at
the
one
point
if
a
demonstration
is
going
on
elsewhere
at
quebec
it
was
not
till
montcalm
was
face
to
face
with
wolfe
that
he
knew
he
had
to
deal
with
the
whole
british
force
still
less
from
a
strategical
point
of
view
can
we
be
certain
whether
a
particular
landing
represents
an
advance
guard
or
is
a
diversionary
operation
to
mask
a
larger
landing
elsewhere
this
is
a
special
difficulty
when
in
the
case
of
large
operations
the
landing
army
arrives
in
echelon
like
the
second
japanese
army
in
that
instance
the
naval
feint
was
used
strategically
and
apparently
with
conspicuous
effect
the
russians
were
always
apprehensive
that
the
japanese
would
strike
for
newchuang
at
the
head
of
the
gulf
of
and
for
this
reason
general
stakelberg
who
had
command
of
the
troops
in
the
peninsula
was
not
permitted
to
concentrate
for
effective
action
in
its
southern
part
where
the
japanese
had
fixed
their
landing
place
admiral
togo
in
spite
of
the
strain
on
his
fleet
in
effecting
and
securing
the
disembarkation
of
the
army
detached
a
cruiser
squadron
to
demonstrate
in
the
gulf
the
precise
effect
of
this
feint
upon
the
russian
staff
can
not
be
measured
with
certainty
all
we
know
is
that
stakelberg
was
held
back
from
his
concentration
so
long
that
he
was
unable
to
strike
the
japanese
army
before
it
was
complete
for
the
field
and
able
to
deal
him
a
staggering
this
power
of
disturbing
the
enemy
with
feints
is
of
course
inherent
in
the
peculiar
attributes
of
combined
expeditions
in
the
facility
with
which
their
line
of
operation
can
be
concealed
or
changed
and
there
seems
no
reason
why
in
the
future
it
should
be
less
than
in
the
past
good
railway
connections
in
the
theatre
of
the
descent
will
of
course
diminish
the
effect
of
feints
but
on
the
other
hand
the
means
of
making
them
have
increased
in
vessels
for
instance
there
is
a
new
instrument
which
in
the
war
proved
capable
of
creating
a
very
strong
impression
at
small
cost
to
the
fleet
should
a
flotilla
of
such
craft
appear
at
any
practicable
part
of
a
threatened
coast
and
make
a
show
of
clearing
it
it
will
be
almost
a
moral
impossibility
to
ignore
the
demonstration
on
the
whole
then
assuming
the
old
methods
are
followed
it
would
seem
that
with
a
reasonable
naval
preponderance
the
power
of
carrying
out
such
operations
over
an
uncommanded
sea
is
not
less
than
it
has
proved
to
be
hitherto
the
rapidity
and
precision
of
steam
propulsion
perhaps
places
that
power
higher
than
ever
it
would
at
any
rate
be
difficult
to
find
in
the
past
a
parallel
to
the
brilliant
movement
on
seoul
with
which
the
japanese
opened
the
war
in
it
is
true
the
russians
at
the
last
moment
decided
for
political
reasons
to
permit
the
occupation
to
take
place
without
opposition
but
this
was
unknown
to
the
japanese
and
their
arrangements
were
made
on
the
assumption
that
their
enemy
would
use
the
formidable
means
at
his
disposal
to
obstruct
the
operation
the
risk
was
accepted
skillfully
measured
and
adequately
provided
for
on
principles
identical
with
those
of
the
british
tradition
but
on
the
other
hand
there
has
been
nothing
to
show
that
where
the
enemy
has
a
working
command
of
the
sea
the
hazard
of
such
enterprises
has
been
reduced
against
an
enemy
controlling
the
line
of
passage
in
force
the
methods
of
covering
and
protecting
an
oversea
expedition
will
no
more
work
than
they
did
in
the
past
until
his
hold
is
broken
by
purely
naval
action
combined
work
remains
beyond
all
legitimate
risk

the

we
seek
our
ends
by
directing

upon
certain
objects
which
may
be
ulterior
or
immediate
immediate

also
called
primary
are
the
ends
of
particular
operations
or
movements
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
every
primary
object
has
also
its
ulterior
object
that
is
every
operation
must
be
regarded
not
only
from
the
point
of
view
of
its
special
object
but
also
as
a
step
to
the

of
the

is
the

minor

this
also

that

must
be
regarded
in
a
double
light
it
must
be
planned

major

in
its
broadest
sense
has
also
to
deal
with
the
whole
resources
of
the
nation

war
it
is
a
branch
of
statesmanship
it
regards
the
army
and
navy
as
parts
of
one
force
to
be
handled
together
they
are
instruments
of
war
but
it
also
has
to
keep
in
view
constantly
the
position
of
the
country
on
which
depends
the
effective
action
of
the
instrument
and
its
commercial
and
financial
position
by
which
the
energy
for
working
the
instrument
is
maintained
the
friction
of
these
two
considerations
is
inherent
in
war
and
we
call
it
the
deflection
of
strategy
by
politics
it
is
usually
regarded
as
a
disease
it
is
really
a
vital
factor
in
every
strategical
problem
it
may
be
taken
as
a
general
rule
that
no
question
of
grand
strategy
can
be
decided
apart
from
diplomacy
and
vice
versa
for
a
line
of
action
or
an
object
which
is
expedient
from
the
point
of
view
of
strategy
may
be
barred
by
diplomatic
considerations
and
vice
versa
to
decide
a
question
of
grand
strategy
without
consideration
of
its
diplomatic
aspect
is
to
decide
on
half
the
factors
only
neither
strategy
or
diplomacy
has
ever
a
clean
slate
this
interaction
has
to
be
accepted
by
commanding
officers
as
part
of
the
inevitable
friction
of
war
a
good
example
is
pitt
refusal
to
send
a
fleet
into
the
baltic
to
assist
frederick
the
great
during
the
seven
years
war
for
fear
of
compromising
our
relations
with
the
scandinavian
powers
minor
strategy
has
for
its
province
the
plans
of
operations
it
deals
with
the
selection
of
the
objectives
that
is
the
particular
forces
of
the
enemy
or
the
strategical
points
to
be
dealt
with
in
order
to
secure
the
object
of
the
particular
operation
the
directing
of
the

assigned
for
the
operation
minor
strategy
may
be
of
three
kinds
naval
where
the
immediate
object
is
to
be
attained
by
a
fleet
only
military
where
the
immediate
object
is
to
be
attained
by
an
army
only
combined
where
the
immediate
object
is
to
be
attained
by
army
and
navy
together
it
will
be
seen
that
what
is
usually
called
naval
strategy
or
fleet
strategy
is
only
a
of
a
division
of
strategy
and
that
therefore
strategy
can
not
be
studied
from
the
point
of
view
of
naval
operations
only
naval
strategy
being
only
a
part
of
general
strategy
is
subject
to
the
same
friction
as
major
strategy
though
in
a
less
degree
individual
commanders
have
often
to
take
a
decision
independently
of
the
central
government
or
headquarters
they
should
therefore
always
keep
in
mind
the
possible
ulterior
effects
of
any
line
of

they
may
take

be

nature
of
object
the
solution
of
every
strategical
problem
whether
of
major
or
minor
strategy
depends
primarily
on
the
nature
of
the
object
in
view
all
objects
whether
ulterior
or
not
may
be
positive
or
negative
a
positive
object
is
where
we
seek
to
assert
or
acquire
something
for
ourselves
a
negative
object
is
where
we
seek
to
deny
the
enemy
something
or
prevent
his
gaining
something
where
the
object
is
positive
strategy
is
offensive
where
the
object
is
negative
strategy
is
defensive
when
togo
attacked
rojesvensky
his
primary
object
was
offensive
to
capture
or
destroy
the
russian
fleet
his
ulterior
object
was
to
maintain
the
defensive
function
which
had
been
assigned
to
the
japanese
fleet
this
is
a
good
example
of
true
defensive
that
is
operations
though
drastically
offensive
in
action
were
all
strictly
within
the
strategical
defensive
sphere
assigned
to
him
the
offensive
being
positive
in
its
aim
is
naturally
the
more
effective
form
of
war
it
leads
more
directly
to
a
final
decision
and
as
a
rule
should
be
adopted
by
the
stronger
power
the
defensive
being
negative
in
its
aim
is
naturally
the
stronger
form
of
war
it
requires
less
force
and
as
a
rule
is
adopted
by
the
weaker
power
the
general
truth
of
this
proposition
is
not
affected
by
apparent
exceptions
where
the
contrary
appears
to
be
true
offensive
must
not
be
confused
with
the
it
is
possible
to
seize
the
initiative
under
certain
conditions
by
taking
a
defensive
position
from
which
the
enemy
is
bound
to
dislodge
us
or
abandon
the
operation
in
most
cases
where
the
weaker
side
successfully
assumes
the
offensive
it
is
due
to
his
doing
so
before
the
enemy
mobilization
or
concentration
is
complete
whereby
the
attacking
force
is
able
to
deal
in
succession
with
locally
inferior
forces
of
the
enemy
the
advantages
of
the
offensive
are
well
known
its
disadvantages
are
that
it
grows
weaker
as
it
advances
by
prolonging
its
communications
that
it
tends
to
operations
on
unfamiliar
ground
that
it
continually
increases
the
difficulty
of
retreat
the
advantages
of
defence
are
chiefly
proximity
to
base
familiar
ground
facility
for
arranging
surprise
by
counter
attack
in
modern
naval
warfare
these
advantages
that
is
the
advantages
of
fighting
on
your
own
ground
are
specially
high
as
giving
greater
facility
for
the
use
of
mine
and
torpedo
the
disadvantages
are
mainly
moral
or
when
the
enemy
objective
or
line
of
operations
can
not
be
ascertained
but
this
disadvantage
can
be
neutralised

it
is

general
characteristics
of
the
defensive
true
defensive
means
waiting
for
a
chance
to
strike
when
the
dutch
burnt
our
ships
at
chatham
we
were
not
acting
on
the
defensive
we
had
laid
them
up
and
were
doing
nothing
at
all
the
strength
and
the
essence
of
the
defensive
is
the
a
well
designed
defensive
will
always
threaten
or
conceal
an
attack
a
general
defensive
policy
may
consist
of
a
series
of
minor
offensive
operations
the
maxim
is
if
you
are
not
relatively
strong
enough
to
assume
the
offensive
assume
the
defensive
till
you
become
so
either
by
inducing
the
enemy
to
weaken
himself
by
attacks
or
otherwise
or
by
increasing
your
own
strength
by
developing
new
forces
or
securing
allies
except
as
a
preparation
or
a
cover
for
offensive
action
the
defensive
is
seldom
or
never
of
any
use
for
by
the
defensive
alone
we
can
never
acquire
anything
we
can
only
prevent
the
enemy
acquiring
but
where
we
are
too
weak
to
assume
the
offensive
it
is
often
necessary
to
assume
the
defensive
and
wait
in
expectation
of
time
turning
the
scale
in
our
favour
and
permitting
us
to
accumulate
strength
relatively
greater
than
the
enemy
we
then
pass
to
the
offensive
for
which
our
defensive
has
been
a
preparation
as
a
cover
or
support
for
the
offensive
the
defensive
will
enable
us
to
intensify
the
attack
for
by
assuming
the
defensive
in
one
or
more
minor
theatres
of
operation
we
can
reduce
our
forces
in
those
theatres
to
a
minimum
and
concentrate
to
a
maximum

the

which

it

this

of

similar

undertaken
against

diversions
are
designed
to
confuse
his
strategy
to
distract
his
attention
and
to
draw
off
his
forces
from
his
main
attack
if
well
planned
they
should
divert
a
force
greater
than
their

they
should
therefore
be
small
the
nearer
they
approach
the

of

the
less

they

nature

from
the
nature
of
the
ulterior

we
get
an
important
classification
of
wars
according
to
whether
such
object
is
or
war
with
limited
war
is
where
we
merely
seek
to
take
from
the
enemy
some
particular
part
of
his
possessions
or
interests
war
where
the
object
was
the
liberation
of
cuba
with
an
unlimited
is
where
we
seek
to
overthrow
the
enemy
completely
so
that
to
save
himself
from
destruction
he
must
agree
to
do

ulterior
objects
are
not
necessarily
the
same
in
their
nature
as
the
immediate
primary
or
secondary
objects
which
lead
up
to
them
ulterior
objects
may
be
offensive
while
one
or
more
of
the
immediate
objects
may
be
defensive
and
example
japanese
position
in
the
late
war
ulterior
object
of
the
war
to
drive
russians
from
manchuria
was
offensive
positive
function
or
ulterior
object
of
the
fleet
to
cover
the
invasion
was
defensive
negative
its
primary
object
to
effect
this
was
to
attack
and
destroy
the
russian
naval
force
this
was
offensive
positive
example
in
the
war
the
ulterior
object
of
the
war
was
for
the
americans
to
eject
the
spanish
government
from
cuba
this
was
offensive
the
ulterior
object
of
the
fleet
was
to
prevent
the
spaniards
sending
reinforcements
or
interfering
with
the
intended
american
invasion
this
was
defensive
the
primary
object
of
the
fleet
was
to
bring
the
spanish
fleet
to
action
this
was
offensive
system
of
operations
having
determined
the
nature
of
the
war
by
the
nature
of
its
object
whether
it
is
offensive
or
defensive
and
whether
it
is
limited
or
unlimited
strategy
has
to
decide
on
the
system
of
operations
or
plan
of
the
war
this
depends
upon
the
theatre
of
the
war
the
means
at
our
disposal
of
the
usually
defined
as
all
the
territory
upon
which
the
hostile
parties
may
assail
each
other
this
is
insufficient
for
an
island
power
the
theatre
of
war
will
always
include
sea
areas
truer
definition
geographical
areas
within
which
lie
the
ulterior
objects
of
the
war
and
the
subordinate
objects
that
lead
up
to
them
a
theatre
of
war
may
contain
several
theatres
of
operations
of
is
generally
used
of
the
operations
of
one
belligerent
only
an
operation
is
any
considerable
strategical
undertaking
a
theatre
of
operations
is
usually
defined
as
embracing
all
the
territory
we
seek
to
take
possession
of
or
to
defend
a
truer
definition
is
the
area
whether
of
sea
or
land
or
both
within
which
the
enemy
must
be
overpowered
before
we
can
secure
the
object
of
the
particular
operation
consequently
since
the
nature
of
the
war
varies
with
the
object
it
may
be
defensive
in
one
theatre
of
operations
and
offensive
in
another
where
the
operations
are
defensive
in
character
any
special
movement
or
movements
may
be
offensive
objective
an
objective
is
any
point
or
force
against
which
an
offensive
movement
is
directed
thus
where
the
in
any
theatre
of
operation
is
to
get
command
of
a
certain
sea
in
which
the
enemy
maintains
a
fleet
that
fleet
will
usually
be
the
lines
of
operation
a
line
of
operation
is
the
area
of
land
or
sea
through
which
we
operate
from
our
base
or
starting
point
to
reach
our
objectives
lines
of
operation
may
be
exterior
or
interior
we
are
said
to
hold
the
interior
lines
when
we
hold
such
a
position
in
regard
to
a
theatre
of
operations
that
we
can
reach
its
chief
objective
points
or
forces
more
quickly
than
the
enemy
can
move
to
their
defence
or
assistance
such
a
position
is
called
an
interior
position
exterior
lines
and
exterior
position
are
the
converse
of
these
lines
of
communication
this
expression
is
used
of
three
different
things
of
running
from
the
base
of
operations
to
the
point
which
the
operating
force
has
reached
of
lateral
by
which
several
forces
engaged
in
one
theatre
of
operations
can
communicate
with
each
other
and
move
to
each
other
support
of
which
are
lines
of
supply
reversed
leading
back
to
the
base
these
three
ideas
are
best
described
by
the
term
lines
of
passage
and
communication
which
we
had
in
use
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
ashore
lines
of
passage
and
communication
are
roads
railways
waterways
at
sea
they
may
be
regarded
as
those
waters
over
which
passes
the
normal
course
of
vessels
proceeding
from
the
base
to
the
objective
or
the
force
to
be
supplied
in
land
strategy
the
great
majority
of
problems
are
problems
of
communication
maritime
strategy
has
never
been
regarded
as
hinging
on
communications
but
probably
it
does
so
even
more
than
land
strategy
as
will
appear
from
a
consideration
of
maritime
communications
and
the
extent
to
which
they
are
the
main
preoccupation
of
naval
operations
maritime
communications
the
various
kinds
of
maritime
communications
for
or
against
which
a
fleet
may
have
to
operate
are
its
own
communications
or
those
of
its
adversary
which
correspond
to
the
communications
of
armies
operating
ashore
these
tend
to
increase
in
importance
strategically
with
the
increasing
hunger
of
modern
fleets
for
coal
ammunition
c
the
communications
of
an
army
operating
from
an
advanced
oversea
base
that
is
communication
between
the
advanced
and
the
main
base
trade
routes
that
is
the
communications
upon
which
depend
the
national
resources
and
the
supply
of
the
main
bases
as
well
as
the
lateral
or
connecting
communications
between
various
parts
of
belligerents
possessions
such
lines
of
passage
and
communication
are
the
preoccupation
of
naval
strategy
that
is
to
say
problems
of
naval
strategy
can
be
reduced
to
terms
of
passage
and
communication
and
this
is
probably
the
best
method
of
solving
them
naval
strategy
considered
as
a
question
of
passage
and
communication
by
naval
strategy
we
mean
the
art
of
conducting
the
operations
of
the
fleet
such
operations
must
always
have
for
their
object
passage
and
communication
that
is
the
fleet
is
mainly
occupied
in
guarding
our
own
communications
and
seizing
those
of
the
enemy
proof
we
say
the
aim
of
naval
strategy
is
to
get
command
of
the
sea
what
does
this
mean
it
is
something
quite
different
from
the
military
idea
of
occupying
territory
for
the
sea
can
not
be
the
subject
of
political
dominion
or
ownership
we
can
not
subsist
upon
it
like
an
army
on
conquered
territory
nor
can
we
exclude
neutrals
from
it
admiral
theory
of
conquest
of
water
territory
therefore
involves
a
false
analogy
and
is
not
safe
as
the
basis
of
a
strategical
system
what
then
is
the
value
of
the
sea
in
the
political
system
of
the
world
its
value
is
as
a
means
of
communication
between
states
and
parts
of
states
therefore
the
command
of
the
sea
means
the
control
of
communications
in
which
the
belligerents
are
adversely
concerned
the
command
of
the
sea
can
never
be
like
the
conquest
of
territory
the
ulterior
object
of
a
war
unless
it
be
a
purely
maritime
war
as
were
approximately
our
wars
with
the
dutch
in
the
century
but
it
may
be
a
primary
or
immediate
object
and
even
the
ulterior
object
of
particular
operations
proof
from
history
or
past
history
shows
that
the
actual
functions
of
the
fleet
except
in
purely
maritime
wars
have
been
threefold
the
prevention
or
securing
of
alliances
deterring
or
persuading
neutrals
as
to
participating
in
the
war
the
operations
of
rooke
in
the
first
years
of
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
to
secure
the
adhesion
of
savoy
and
portugal
to
the
grand
alliance
operations
of
nelson
to
maintain
the
alliance
of
the
kingdom
of
naples
in
the
first
case
there
came
a
crisis
when
it
was
more
important
to
demonstrate
to
savoy
and
portugal
what
they
stood
to
lose
by
joining
louis
xiv
than
to
act
immediately
against
the
toulon
fleet
in
the
second
the
neapolitan
alliance
was
essential
to
our
operations
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
the
destruction
of
the
toulon
fleet
was
not
the
protection
or
destruction
of
commerce
the
furtherance
or
hindrance
of
military
operations
ashore
the
above
is
the
best
working
definition
of
naval
strategy
as
emphasising
its
intimate
connection
with
diplomatic
financial
and
military
aspects
of
major
strategy
these
functions
may
be
discharged
in
two
ways
by
direct
territorial
attacks
threatened
or
performed
bombardment
landing
raiding
parties
c
by
getting
command
of
the
sea
establishing
ourselves
in
such
a
position
that
we
can
control
the
maritime
communications
of
all
parties
concerned
so
that
we
can
operate
by
sea
against
their
territory
commerce
and
allies
and
they
can
not
operate
against
ours
the
power
of
the
second
method
by
controlling
communications
is
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
first
direct
attack
indeed
the
first
can
seldom
be
performed
with
any
serious
effect
without
the
second
thus
from
this
point
of
view
also
it
is
clear
that
naval
strategy
is
mainly
a
question
of
communications
but
not
entirely
circumstances
have
arisen
when
the
fleet
must
discharge
part
of
its
function
by
direct
action
before
there
is
time
to
get
general
control
of
the
communications
that
is
political
and
military
considerations
may
deflect

if
we
say
we
have

it
is
a
rhetorical
expression

that
we
have
a

when

that

in
the
situation

remote

the
state
of

is
the
most
important
for
practical
strategy
since
it

the
normal
condition
at

in
the

state
of
dispute
continues
till
a
final
decision
is
obtained
till
one
side
is
no
longer
able
to
send
a
squadron
to
sea
it
is
to
the
advantage
of
the
preponderating
navy
to
end
the
state
of
dispute
by
seeking
a
decision
hence
the
french
tradition
to
avoid
decisive
actions
as
a
rule
when
at
war
with
england
the
truth
of
this
appears
from
the
fact
that
command
of
the
sea
is
not
essential
to
all
oversea
in
a
state
of
dispute
the
preponderating
power
may
concentrate
in
one
theatre
of
operations
and
so
secure
the
local
or
temporary
command
sufficient
for
obtaining
the
special
object
in
view
the
weaker
power
may
take
advantage
of
such
local
concentration
to
operate
safely
elsewhere
so
long
as
a
state
of
dispute
can
force
the
preponderating
power
to
concentrate
operating
by
evasion
is
possibly
open
to
the
weaker
in
a
state
of
dispute
although
the
weaker
power
may
not
be
able
to
obstruct
the
passage
and
communication
of
the
stronger
it
may
be
able
to
defend
its
own
this
condition
of
dispute
existed
during
the
first
three
years
of
the
seven
years
war
until
hawke
and
boscawen
obtained
a
decision
by
defeating
conflans
and
de
la
cloue
also
in
the
great
war
up
to
trafalgar
should
command
of
the
sea
always
be
the
primary
object
when
the
preponderating
power
fails
or
neglects
to
get
command
leaves
the
general
command
in
dispute
the
disadvantage
to
him
is
not
so
much
the
danger
to
his
own
operations
as
the
facility
given
to
the
enemy
for
carrying
out
counter
operations
elsewhere
under
certain
conditions
therefore
it
may
not
be
the
primary
function
of
the
fleet
to
seek
out
the
enemy
fleet
and
destroy
it
because
general
command
may
be
in
dispute
while
local
command
may
be
with
us
and
political
or
military
considerations
may
demand
of
us
an
operation
for
which
such
local
command
is
sufficient
and
which
can
not
be
delayed
until
we
have
obtained
a
complete
decision
from
the
above
it
will
appear
command
of
the
sea
is
too
loose
an
expression
for
strategical
discussion
for
practical
purposes
should
be
substituted
of
passage
and
the
question
then
in
the
consideration
of
any
proposed
operation
or
line
of
operations
will
be
not
have
we
the
command
of
the
sea
but
can
we
secure
the
necessary
lines
of
communication

in

the
primary

the
peculiarity
of
maritime
communications
since
the
whole
idea
of
command
of
the
sea
and
the
whole
theory
of
blockade
rest
on
the
control
of
communications
neither
can
be
fully
apprehended
without
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
nature
of
maritime
communications
ashore
the
respective
lines
of
communications
of
each
belligerent
tend
to
run
more
or
less
approximately
in
opposite
directions
until
they
meet
in
the
theatre
of
operations
or
the
objective
point
at
sea
the
reverse
is
the
case
for
in
maritime
warfare
the
great
lines
of
communications
of
either
belligerent
tend
to
run
approximately
parallel
if
indeed
they
are
not
identical
thus
in
the
case
of
a
war
with
germany
the
object
of
which
lay
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
or
in
america
or
south
africa
our
respective
lines
of
communication
would
be
identical
this
was
also
the
case
in
all
our
imperial
wars
with
france
peculiarity
is
the
controlling
influence
of
maritime
nearly
all
our
current
maxims
of
naval
strategy
can
be
traced
to
the
pressure
it
exerts
on
naval
thought
it
is
at
the
root
of
the
fundamental
difference
between
military
and
naval
strategy
and
affords
the
explanation
of
much
strategical
error
and
confusion
which
has
arisen
from
applying
the
principles
of
land
warfare
to
the
sea
without
allowing
for
the
antagonistic
conditions
of
the
communications
and
operations
against
them
in
each
case
on
land
the
chief
reason
for
not
always
striking
the
enemy
communications
at
once
is
that
as
a
rule
we
can
not
do
so
without
exposing
our
own
at
sea
on
the
contrary
since
the
great
lines
are
common
to
both
we
can
not
defend
our
own
without
striking
at
the
enemy
therefore
at
sea
the
obvious
opening
is
to
get
your
fleet
into
such
a
position
that
it
controls
the
common
lines
unless
defeated
or
evaded
this
was
usually
done
in
our
old
wars
with
france
by
our
getting
a
fleet
off
brest
before
the
french
could
sail
hence
the
maxim
that
the
proper
place
for
our
fleets
is
off
the
coast
the
enemy
coast
is
our
true
frontier
and
the
like
but
these
maxims
are
not
universally
true
witness
togo
strategy
against
rojesvensky
when
he
remained
correctly
upon
his
own
coast
take
again
the
maxim
that
the
primary
object
of
the
fleet
is
to
seek
out
the
enemy
fleet
and
destroy
it
here
again
togo
practice
was
the
reverse
of
the
maxim
the
true
maxim
is
the
primary
object
of
the
fleet
is
to
secure
communications
and
if
the
enemy
fleet
is
in
a
position
to
render
them
unsafe
it
must
be
put
out
of
action
the
enemy
fleet
usually
is
in
this
position
but
not
always
opening
of
war
of
spanish
succession
the
operations
of
were
to
secure
some
point
cadiz
gibraltar
or
ferrol
on
the
spanish
trade
communications
the
french
lateral
communications
and
our
own
lines
of
passage
to
the
mediterranean
where
was
to
be
our
chief
theatre
of
operation
these
last
two
lines
were
identical
chief
operations
had
for
their
object
to
secure
the
alliance
of
savoy
and
particularly
of
portugal
and
with
same
object
in
view
official
instructions
directed
that
the
french
fleet
was
to
be
ignored
unless
it
threatened
our
communications
by
we
had
gained
a
naval
position
from
which
france
could
not
eject
us
and
she
abandoned
struggle
for
sea
communications
but
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
maxim
of
seeking
out
the
enemy
fleet
is
sound
and
applicable
a
because
for
us
permanent
is
usually
essential
to
ultimate
success
and
this
can
not
be
obtained
without
destroying
the
enemy
fleet
b
because
usually
the
enemy
fleet
opens
with
an
attempt
control
the
common
c
because
usually
the
functions
of
the
fleet
are
so
complex
the
calls
upon
it
so
numerous
that
it
will
seek
to
strike
a
blow
which
solve
all
the
difficulties
sir
palmes
solution
of
the
problem
in
in
the
vol
also
it
must
be
remembered
that
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
most
effective
way
of
seeking
out
the
enemy
fleet
forcing
an
action
on
him
is
to
seize
a
position
which
controls
communications
vital
to
his
plan
of
campaign
this
was
what
happened
in
rooke
was
unable
to
seek
out
the
toulon
fleet
but
by
seizing
gibraltar
he
made
it
come
to
him
not
intentionally
but
by
the
operation
of
inevitable
strategical
law
compare
togo
strategy
and
that
of
the
americans
in
practically
all
great
naval
actions
have
been
brought
about
in
this
way
that
is
they
have
been
the
outcome
on
an
effort
to
clear
essential
communications
from
the
enemy
fleet
gravelines
la
hogue
quiberon
trafalgar
tsushima
similarly
the
great
actions
of
the
old
dutch
wars
were
brought
about
because
our
geographical
position
placed
us
astride
the
dutch
trade
communications
and
they
were
forced
to
seek
a
decision
against
our
fleet
final
note
in
applying
the
maxim
of
seeking
out
the
enemy
fleet
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
if
you
seek
it
out
with
a
superior
force
you
will
probably
find
it
in
a
place
where
you
can
not
destroy
it
except
at
heavy
cost
that
seeing
that
the
defensive
is
a
stronger
form
of
war
than
the
offensive
it
is
better
strategy
to
make
the
enemy
come
to
you
than
to
go
to
him
and
seek
a
decision
on
his
own
ground

course
notes
on
strategy
part
one
general
principles
and
definitions
introductory
naval
strategy
is
a
section
of
the
art
of
war
the
study
for
officers
is
the
art
of
war
which
includes
naval
strategy
war
is
the
application
of
force
to
the
attainment
of
political
ends
major
and
minor
strategy
we
seek
our
ends
by
directing
force
upon
certain
objects
which
may
be
ulterior
or
primary
are
the
special
objects
of
particular
operations
or
movements
which
we
undertake
in
order
to
gain
the
ulterior
object
of
the
campaign
consequently
it
must
be
remembered
that
every
particular
operation
or
movement
must
be
regarded
not
only
from
the
point
of
view
of
its
special
object
but
also
as
a
step
to
the
end
of
the
campaign
or
war
strategy
is
the
art
of
directing
force
to
the
ends
in
view
there
are
two
kinds
major
strategy
dealing
with
ulterior
objects
minor
strategy
with
primary
objects
every
operation
of
an
army
or
fleet
must
be
planned
and
conducted
in
relation
to
the
general
plan
of
the
war
to
the
object
to
which
it
is
immediately
directed
major
strategy
always
regarding
the
ulterior
object
has
for
its
province
the
plan
of
the
war
and
includes
selection
of
the
immediate
or
primary
objects
to
be
aimed
at
for
attaining
the
ulterior
object
selection
of
the
force
to
be
used
it
determines
the
relative
functions
of
the
naval
and
military
forces
major
strategy
in
its
broadest
sense
deals
with
the
whole
resources
of
the
nation
for
war
it
is
a
branch
of
statesmanship
which
regards
the
army
and
navy
as
parts
of
one
force
to
be
handled
together
as
the
instrument
of
war
but
it
also
has
to
keep
in
constant
touch
with
the
political
and
diplomatic
position
of
the
country
on
which
depends
the
effective
action
of
the
instrument
and
the
commercial
and
financial
position
by
which
the
energy
for
working
the
instrument
is
maintained
the
friction
due
to
these
considerations
is
inherent
in
war
and
is
called
the
deflection
of
strategy
by
politics
it
is
usually
regarded
as
a
disease
it
is
really
a
vital
factor
in
every
strategical
problem
it
may
be
taken
as
a
general
rule
that
no
question
of
major
strategy
can
be
decided
apart
from
diplomacy
and
for
a
line
of
action
or
an
object
which
is
expedient
from
the
point
of
view
of
strategy
may
be
barred
by
diplomatic
considerations
and
to
decide
a
question
of
major
strategy
without
consideration
of
its
diplomatic
aspect
is
to
decide
on
half
the
factors
only
neither
strategy
or
diplomacy
has
ever
a
clean
slate
this
has
to
be
accepted
as
part
of
the
inevitable
friction
of
war
a
good
example
is
refusal
to
send
a
fleet
into
the
baltic
to
assist
frederick
the
great
during
the
seven
years
war
for
fear
of
compromising
our
relations
with
the
scandinavian
powers
minor
strategy
has
for
its
province
the
plans
of
operations
it
deals
with
the
selection
of
the
objectives
that
is
the
particular
forces
of
the
enemy
or
the
strategical
points
to
be
dealt
with
in
order
to
secure
the
object
of
the
particular
operation
the
direction
of
the
force
assigned
for
the
operation
minor
strategy
may
therefore
be
of
three
kinds
naval
where
the
immediate
object
is
to
be
attained
by
a
fleet
only
military
where
the
immediate
object
is
to
be
attained
by
an
army
only
combined
where
the
immediate
object
is
to
be
attained
by
army
and
navy
together
it
will
be
seen
therefore
that
what
is
usually
called
naval
strategy
or
fleet
strategy
is
only
a
of
strategy
and
that
therefore
strategy
can
not
be
studied
from
the
point
of
view
of
naval
operations
only
naval
strategy
being
a
part
of
general
strategy
is
subject
to
the
same
friction
as
major
strategy
though
in
a
less
degree
individual
commanders
have
often
to
take
a
decision
independently
of
the
central
government
or
headquarters
they
should
therefore
always
keep
in
mind
the
possible
ulterior
effects
of
any
line
of
action
they
may
take
endeavouring
to
be
sure
that
what
is
strategically
expedient
is
not
diplomatically
inexpedient
for
example
take
boscawen
attack
on
de
la
motte
on
the
eve
of
the
seven
years
war
in
his
orders
were
to
prevent
the
troops
and
warlike
stores
which
de
la
motte
was
taking
out
from
reaching
canada
it
was
not
diplomatically
expedient
to
open
hostilities
but
if
boscawen
succeeded
the
result
would
have
been
worth
the
diplomatic
consequences
it
would
entail
he
missed
the
expedition
but
captured
two
isolated
vessels
thus
striking
the
first
blow
in
such
a
way
as
to
entail
the
utmost
amount
of
harm
with
the
least
possible
good
offensive
and
defensive
of
upon
the
nature
of
the
object
depends
the
fundamental
distinction
between
and
upon
which
all
strategical
calculation
must
be
based
consequently
the
solution
of
every
strategical
problem
whether
of
major
or
minor
strategy
depends
primarily
on
the
nature
of
the
object
in
view
all
objects
whether
ulterior
or
not
may
be
positive
or
negative
a
object
is
where
we
seek
to
assert
or
acquire
something
for
ourselves
a
object
is
where
we
seek
to
deny
the
enemy
something
or
prevent
his
gaining
something
where
the
object
is
positive
strategy
is
offensive
where
the
object
is
negative
strategy
is
defensive
this
is
the
only
certain
test
by
which
we
can
decide
whether
any
particular
operation
is
offensive
or
defensive
ulterior
objects
are
not
necessarily
the
same
in
their
nature
as
the
primary
or
secondary
objects
which
lead
up
to
them
ulterior
objects
may
be
offensive
while
one
or
more
of
the
primary
objects
may
be
defensive
and
for
example
in
the
war
the
ulterior
object
of
the
war
to
drive
russians
from
manchuria
was
offensive
positive
the
ulterior
object
of
the
fleet
to
cover
the
invasion
was
defensive
negative
its
primary
object
to
effect
this
was
to
attack
and
destroy
the
russian
naval
force
this
was
offensive
positive
of
offensive
to
the
offensive
being
positive
in
its
aim
is
naturally
the
more
effective
form
of
war
and
as
a
rule
should
be
adopted
by
the
stronger
power
the
defensive
being
negative
in
its
aim
is
the
more
lasting
form
of
war
since
it
requires
less
force
to
keep
what
one
has
than
to
take
what
is
another
and
as
a
rule
is
adopted
by
the
weaker
power
in
most
cases
where
the
weaker
side
successfully
assumes
the
offensive
it
is
due
to
his
doing
so
before
the
enemy
mobilization
or
concentration
is
complete
whereby
the
attacking
force
is
able
to
deal
in
succession
with
locally
inferior
forces
of
the
enemy
the
advantages
of
the
offensive
are
well
known
its
disadvantages
are
that
it
grows
weaker
as
it
advances
by
prolonging
its
communications
and
that
it
tends
to
operations
on
unfamiliar
ground
the
advantages
of
the
defensive
are
chiefly
proximity
to
the
base
of
supply
and
repair
stations
familiar
ground
facility
for
arranging
surprise
by
counter
attack
and
power
of
organising
in
advance
the
disadvantages
of
the
defensive
are
mainly
moral
they
become
however
real
and
practical
when
the
enemy
objective
or
line
of
operations
can
not
be
ascertained
for
then
we
have
to
spread
or
attenuate
our
force
to
cover
all
probable
objectives
but
this
disadvantage
can
be
neutralised
when
it
is
possible
to
secure
an
interior
position
and
characteristics
of
the
true
defensive
means
waiting
for
a
chance
to
strike
to
assume
the
defensive
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
we
do
not
feel
strong
enough
to
attack
it
may
mean
that
we
see
our
way
by
using
the
defensive
to
force
certain
movements
on
the
enemy
which
will
enable
us
to
hit
harder
a
defensive
will
always
threaten
or
conceal
an
attack
unless
it
does
this
it
will
not
deflect
the
enemy
strategy
in
our
favour
thus
in
the
french
by
assuming
the
defensive
in
the
channel
threatened
an
attack
on
our
coasts
and
concealed
their
attack
on
minorca
this
power
inherent
in
the
defensive
is
peculiarly
strong
in
naval
warfare
since
the
mobility
of
fleets
enables
them
to
pass
instantaneously
from
the
defensive
to
the
offensive
without
any
warning
when
we
assume
the
defensive
because
we
are
too
weak
for
the
offensive
we
still
do
not
lay
aside
attack
the
whole
strength
and
essence
of
the
defensive
is
the
its
cardinal
idea
is
to
force
the
enemy
to
attack
us
in
a
position
where
he
will
expose
himself
to
a
the
stock
instance
upon
which
naval
defensive
is
usually
condemned
is
the
burning
of
our
ships
at
chatham
by
the
dutch
but
in
that
case
we
were
not
on
the
at
all
we
had
laid
up
our
battle
fleet
and
were
doing
nothing
we
were
purely
passive
in
expectation
of
peace
it
is
really
an
instance
of
the
successful
use
of
defensive
the
being
no
longer
strong
enough
for
a
general
offensive
they
assumed
the
defensive
and
induced
us
to
lay
up
our
ships
and
so
expose
ourselves
to
a
it
was
a
counterstroke
by
the
worsted
belligerent
to
get
better
terms
of
peace
so
far
is
the
defensive
from
excluding
the
idea
of
attack
that
it
may
consist
entirely
of
a
series
of
minor
offensive
operations
clausewitz
calls
it
a
shield
of
blows
it
is
often
called
or
neither
term
is
really
necessary
for
a
defensive
which
excludes
the
idea
of
offence
or
action
is
not
war
at
least
at
sea
the
old
elizabethan
term
most
closely
expresses
the
idea
the
most
important
function
of
the
defensive
is
that
of
covering
buttressing
and
intensifying
the
main
attack
no
plan
of
campaign
however
strong
the
offensive
intention
is
perfect
which
does
not
contemplate
the
use
of
the
defensive
without
some
use
of
the
defensive
the
cardinal
principle
of
concentration
can
rarely
be
fully
developed
to
develop
the
highest
possible
degree
of
concentration
upon
the
main
object
or
objective
the
defensive
must
be
assumed
everywhere
else
because
it
is
only
by
using
the
defensive
in
the
minor
or
less
important
theatres
of
operation
that
the
forces
in
those
theatres
can
be
reduced
to
the
minimum
of
security
and
the
maximum
of
concentration
can
thereby
be
obtained
in
the
main
theatre
in
considering
the
defensive
as
a
general
plan
of
campaign
the
maxim
is
if
not
relatively
strong
enough
to
assume
the
offensive
assume
the
defensive
till
you
become
so
either
by
inducing
the
enemy
to
weaken
himself
by
attacks
or
otherwise
or
by
increasing
your
own
strength
by
developing
new
forces
or
securing
allies
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
except
as
a
preparation
or
a
cover
for
offensive
action
the
defensive
is
seldom
or
never
of
any
use
for
by
the
continued
use
of
the
defensive
alone
nothing
can
be
acquired
though
the
enemy
may
be
prevented
from
acquiring
anything
but
where
we
are
too
weak
to
assume
the
offensive
it
is
often
necessary
to
assume
the
defensive
and
wait
in
expectation
of
time
turning
the
scale
in
our
favour
and
permitting
us
to
accumulate
strength
relatively
greater
than
the
enemy
we
then
pass
to
the
offensive
for
which
our
defensive
has
been
a
preparation
at
sea
we
have
had
little
occasion
for
the
defensive
as
a
general
plan
but
that
is
no
reason
for
neglecting
its
study
in
despising
the
defensive
ourselves
we
have
consistently
ignored
the
strength
it
gives
our
enemies
the
bulk
of
our
naval
history
is
the
story
of
how
we
have
been
baffled
and
thwarted
by
our
enemies
assuming
the
defensive
at
sea
in
support
of
their
offensive
on
land
we
have
seldom
succeeded
in
treating
this
attitude
with
success
and
it
is
only
by
studying
the
defensive
we
can
hope
to
do
so
operations
used
with
a
defensive
a
counter
attacks
b
diversions
are
those
which
are
made
upon
an
enemy
who
exposes
himself
anywhere
in
the
theatre
of
his
offensive
operations
it
is
this
form
of
attack
which
constitutes
what
clausewitz
calls
the
surprise
advantage
of
defence
are
similar
operations
undertaken
against
an
enemy
outside
the
limit
of
his
theatre
of
offensive
operations
diversions
are
designed
to
confuse
his
strategy
to
distract
his
attention
and
to
draw
off
his
forces
from
his
main
attack
if
well
planned
they
should
divert
a
force
greater
than
their
own
they
should
therefore
be
small
the
nearer
they
approach
the
importance
of
a
real
attack
the
less
likely
they
are
to
divert
a
force
greater
than
their
own
diversions
involve
a
breach
of
the
law
of
concentration
and
it
is
only
their
power
of
diverting
or
containing
a
larger
force
than
their
own
that
justifies
their
use
this
power
depends
mainly
on
suddenness
and
mobility
and
these
qualities
are
most
highly
developed
in
combined
expeditions
must
be
carefully
distinguished
from
attacks
eccentric
are
true
offensive
movements
they
have
a
positive
object
they
aim
to
acquire
something
from
the
enemy
whereas
diversions
have
a
negative
object
they
aim
at
preventing
the
enemy
doing
or
acquiring
something
eccentric
attacks
are
usually
made
in
greater
force
than
diversions
our
raid
on
washington
in
landing
force
about
men
object
according
to
official
instruction
a
diversion
on
the
coasts
of
united
states
of
america
in
favour
of
the
army
employed
in
the
defence
of
canada
the
intention
was
negative
preventive
defensive
operations
against
new
orleans
in
intended
force
to
men
object
to
obtain
command
of
the
embouchure
of
the
mississippi
and
secondly
to
occupy
some
important
and
valuable
possession
by
the
restoration
of
which
the
conditions
of
peace
might
be
improved
the
intention
was
positive
to
acquire
compare
rochefort
expedition
diversion
with
those
against
martinique
and
belleisle
eccentric
attacks
in
the
seven
war
this
distinction
gives
a
threefold
classification
of
combined
expeditions
as
used
by
elizabethan
strategists
raids
incursions
and
invasions
these
correspond
respectively
with
our
modern
diversions
eccentric
attacks
and
true
direct
offensive
limited
and
unlimited
wars
from
the
nature
of
the
ulterior
object
we
get
an
important
classification
of
wars
according
to
whether
such
object
is
or
with
limited
limited
war
is
where
the
object
is
merely
to
take
from
the
enemy
some
particular
part
of
his
possessions
or
interests
war
where
the
object
was
the
liberation
of
cuba
with
an
unlimited
is
where
the
object
is
to
overthrow
the
enemy
completely
so
that
to
save
himself
from
destruction
he
must
agree
to
do
our
will
become
subservient
war
plans
of
war
of
having
determined
the
nature
of
the
war
by
the
nature
of
its
object
whether
it
is
offensive
or
defensive
and
whether
it
is
limited
or
unlimited
strategy
has
to
decide
on
the
system
of
operations
or
plan
of
the
war
apart
from
the
means
at
our
disposal
a
plan
of
war
depends
mainly
upon
the
theatre
of
the
war
the
various
theatres
of
operation
available
within
it
of
the
usually
defined
as
all
the
territory
upon
which
the
hostile
parties
may
assail
each
other
this
is
insufficient
for
an
island
power
the
theatre
of
war
will
always
include
sea
areas
truer
definition
geographical
areas
within
which
must
lie
the
operations
necessary
for
the
attainment
of
the
ulterior
objects
of
the
war
and
of
the
subordinate
objects
that
lead
up
to
them
a
theatre
of
war
may
contain
several
theatres
of
operations
of
is
generally
used
of
the
operations
of
one
belligerent
only
an
operation
is
any
considerable
strategical
undertaking
a
theatre
of
operations
is
usually
defined
as
embracing
all
the
territory
we
seek
to
take
possession
of
or
to
defend
a
truer
definition
is
the
area
whether
of
sea
or
land
or
both
within
which
the
enemy
must
be
overpowered
before
we
can
secure
the
object
of
the
particular
operation
consequently
since
the
nature
of
the
war
varies
with
the
object
it
may
be
defensive
in
one
theatre
of
operations
and
offensive
in
another
where
the
operations
are
defensive
in
character
any
special
movement
or
movements
may
be
offensive
as
the
plan
of
war
determines
the
theatres
of
operation
in
the
theatre
of
war
so
in
each
theatre
of
operation
it
determines
the
of
and
the
an
objective
is
any
point
or
force
against
which
an
offensive
movement
is
directed
thus
where
the
in
any
theatre
of
operation
is
to
get
command
of
a
certain
sea
in
which
the
enemy
maintains
a
fleet
that
fleet
will
usually
be
the
objective
in
ordinary
use
is
frequently
confused
with
object
for
purposes
of
strategical
discussion
it
is
desirable
to
keep
them
sharply
distinguished
is
the
end
of
some
particular
movement
or
operation
and
is
the
special
concern
of
the
officer
in
command
is
the
end
of
a
system
of
operations
and
is
the
special
concern
of
the
general
staff
or
director
of
the
war
an
is
some
definite
point
which
we
wish
to
get
from
the
enemy
or
prevent
his
occupying
or
some
part
of
his
strength
which
we
wish
to
destroy
it
is
incorrect
to
use
the
term
of
anything
we
already
possess
thus
vladivostock
is
often
said
to
have
been
rojesvensky
it
was
strictly
speaking
only
his
to
reach
it
and
concentrate
with
the
units
already
there
was
the
of
the
operations
entrusted
to
him
he
had
no

togo

an
is
always
subordinate
to
some
it
is
a
step
to
the
attainment
of
that
object
of
a
line
of
operation
is
the
area
of
land
or
sea
through
which
we
operate
from
our
base
or
starting
point
to
reach
our
objectives
lines
of
operation
may
be
or
we
are
said
to
hold
the
lines
when
we
hold
such
a
position
in
regard
to
a
theatre
of
operations
that
we
can
reach
its
chief
objective
points
or
forces
more
quickly
than
the
enemy
can
move
to
their
defence
or
assistance
such
a
position
is
called
an
exterior
lines
and
exterior
positions
are
the
converse
of
these
of
this
expression
is
used
of
three
different
things
of
running
from
the
base
of
operations
to
the
point
which
the
operating
force
has
reached
of
lateral
by
which
several
forces
engaged
in
one
theatre
of
operations
can
communicate
with
each
other
and
move
to
each
other
support
of
which
are
usually
lines
of
supply
reversed
leading
back
to
the
base
for
naval
purposes
these
three
ideas
are
best
described
by
the
term
lines
of
passage
and
communication
which
were
in
use
at
the
end
of
the
century
and
they
may
be
regarded
as
those
waters
over
which
passes
the
normal
course
of
vessels
proceeding
from
the
base
to
the
objective
or
the
force
to
be
supplied
the
various
kinds
of
maritime
communications
for
or
against
which
a
fleet
may
have
to
operate
are
its
own
communications
or
those
of
its
adversary
which
correspond
to
the
communications
of
armies
operating
ashore
these
have
greatly
increased
in
importance
strategically
with
the
increased
dependence
of
modern
fleets
on
a
regular
supply
of
coals
stores
ammunition
the
communications
of
an
army
operating
from
an
advanced
oversea
base
that
is
communication
between
the
advanced
and
the
main
base
trade
routes
that
is
the
communications
upon
which
depend
the
national
resources
and
the
supply
of
the
main
bases
as
well
as
the
lateral
or
connecting
communications
between
various
parts
of
belligerents
possessions
in
land
strategy
the
great
majority
of
problems
are
problems
of
communication
maritime
strategy
has
never
been
regarded
as
hinging
on
communications
but
probably
it
does
so
as
will
appear
from
a
consideration
of
maritime
communications
and
the
extent
to
which
they
are
the
main
preoccupation
of
naval
operations
that
is
to
say
all
problems
of
naval
strategy
can
be
reduced
to
terms
of
passage
and
communication
and
this
is
probably
the
best
method
of
solving
them
part
two
naval
strategy
considered
as
a
question
of
passage
and
communication
naval
strategy
defined
by
naval
strategy
we
mean
the
art
of
conducting
the
major
operations
of
the
fleet
such
operations
have
for
their
object
passage
and
communication
that
is
the
fleet
is
mainly
occupied
in
guarding
our
own
communications
and
seizing
those
of
the
enemy
we
say
the
aim
of
naval
strategy
is
to
get
command
of
the
sea
this
means
something
quite
different
from
the
military
idea
of
occupying
territory
for
the
sea
can
not
be
the
subject
of
political
dominion
or
ownership
we
can
not
subsist
upon
it
like
an
army
on
conquered
territory
nor
can
we
exclude
neutrals
from
it
the
value
of
the
sea
in
the
political
system
of
the
world
is
as
a
means
of
communication
between
states
and
parts
of
states
therefore
the
command
of
the
sea
means
the
control
of
communications
in
which
the
belligerents
are
adversely
concerned
the
command
of
the
sea
can
never
be
like
the
conquest
of
territory
the
ulterior
object
of
a
war
unless
it
be
a
purely
maritime
war
as
were
approximately
our
wars
with
the
dutch
in
the
century
but
it
may
be
a
primary
or
immediate
object
and
even
the
ulterior
object
of
particular
operations
history
shows
that
the
actual
functions
of
the
fleet
except
in
purely
maritime
wars
have
been
threefold
the
furtherance
or
hindrance
of
military
operations
ashore
the
protection
or
destruction
of
commerce
the
prevention
or
securing
of
alliances
deterring
or
persuading
neutrals
as
to
participating
in
the
war
the
operations
of
rooke
in
the
first
years
of
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
to
secure
the
adhesion
of
savoy
and
portugal
to
the
grand
alliance
operations
of
nelson
to
maintain
the
alliance
of
the
kingdom
of
naples
in
the
first
case
there
came
a
crisis
when
it
was
more
important
to
demonstrate
to
savoy
and
portugal
what
they
stood
to
lose
by
joining
louis
xiv
than
to
act
immediately
against
the
toulon
fleet
in
the
second
the
neapolitan
alliance
was
essential
to
our
operations
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
the
destruction
of
the
toulon
fleet
was
not
in
this
way
we
get
a
of
the
aim
of
naval
expressed
in
terms
of
the
actual
functions
of
the
fleet
for
practical
purposes
it
will
be
found
the
most
useful
definition
as
emphasising
the
intimate
connection
of
naval
strategy
with
the
diplomatic
financial
and
military
aspects
of
major
strategy
these
functions
of
the
fleet
may
be
discharged
in
two
ways
by
direct
territorial
attacks
threatened
or
performed
bombardment
landings
raiding
parties
by
getting
command
of
the
sea
establishing
ourselves
in
such
a
position
that
we
can
control
the
maritime
communications
of
all
parties
concerned
so
that
we
can
operate
by
sea
against
the
territory
commerce
and
allies
and
they
can
not
operate
against
ours
the
power
of
the
second
method
by
controlling
communications
is
out
of
all
proportion
to
that
of
the
first
direct
attack
indeed
the
first
can
seldom
be
performed
with
any
serious
effect
without
the
second
thus
from
this
point
of
view
also
it
is
clear
that
naval
strategy
is
mainly
a
question
of
communications
but
not
entirely
circumstances
have
arisen
when
the
fleet
must
discharge
part
of
its
function
by
direct
action
against
territory
before
there
is
time
to
get
general
control
of
the
communications
that
is
political
and
military
considerations
may
deflect
the
normal
operation
of
naval
strategy
rooke
capture
of
gibraltar
in
in
the
face
of
the
unshaken
toulon
fleet
holmes
capture
of
emden
in
still
the
fact
remains
that
the
key
to
the
effective
performance
of
the
fleet
duties
is
almost
always
to
secure
communications
as
soon
as
possible
by
battle
command
of
the
sea
command
of
the
sea
exists
only
in

state
of

if
we
say
we
have

it

a
rhetorical
expression

that
we
have
adequate
naval
positions
and
an
adequate
fleet
to
secure
the
command
when
war
breaks

command
of
the

not

can
do

nothing

that
he
can
not

which

of

this

in
the
situation
when
the

this
condition
existed
after
tsushima
in
the
state
of
dispute

the
most
important
for
practical
strategy
since
it
is
the
normal
condition
at
least
in
the
early
stages
of
the
war
and
frequently
all
through
it
the
state
of
dispute
continues
till
a
final
decision
is
obtained
till
one
side
is
no
longer
able
to
send
a
squadron
to

is
to
the
advantage
of
the
preponderating
navy
to
end
the
state
of
dispute
by
seeking
a
hence
the
french
tradition
to
avoid
decisive
actions
as
a
rule
when
at
war
with
england
it
must
be
remembered
that
command
of
the
sea
is
not
essential
to
all
oversea
in
a
state
of
dispute
the
preponderating
power
may
concentrate
or
be
induced
to
concentrate
in
one
theatre
of
operations
and
so
secure
the
local
or
temporary
command
sufficient
for
obtaining
the
special
object
in
view
while
the
weaker
power
takes
advantage
of
such
local
concentration
to
operate
safely
elsewhere
thus
in
a
state
of
dispute
although
the
weaker
power
may
not
be
able
to
obstruct
the
passage
and
communication
of
the
stronger
it
may
be
able
to
defend
its
own
this
condition
of
dispute
existed
during
the
first
three
years
of
the
seven
years
war
until
hawke
and
boscawen
obtained
a
decision
by
defeating
conflans
and
de
la
clue
also
in
the
great
war
up
to
trafalgar
when
the
preponderating
power
fails
or
neglects
to
get
command
leaves
the
general
command
in
dispute
the
disadvantage
to
him
is
not
so
much
the
danger
to
his
own
operations
as
the
facility
given
to
the
enemy
for
carrying
out
counter
operations

can
only
be
secured
by

d
blockade
of
a
fleet
off
an
enemy
a
belligerent
fleet
off
an
enemy
port
may
carry
out
three
different
operations
for
certain
purposes
each
quite
separate
from
the
others
and
intended
to
obtain
an
entirely
different
result
this
is
to
prevent
the
enemy
fighting
ships
from
putting
to
sea
in
this
case
the
object
is
to
secure
local
control
for
some
purpose
that
is
not
purely
naval
such
as
was
carried
out
by
the
japanese
off
port
arthur
in
so
as
to
enable
their
transports
to
cross
the
yellow
sea
without
fear
of
molestation
from
any
of
the
russian
ships
in
port
arthur
since
the
cruisers
in
vladivostok
were
able
to
emerge
that
port
not
being
blockaded
the
operation
was
not
complete
and
a
danger
of
interference
always
existed
this
method
of
blockade
is
far
more
difficult
to
carry
out
in
the
present
day
than
formerly
owing
to
the
existence
of
submarines
and
torpedo
craft
the
blockading
ships
have
to
remain
further
away
from
the
port
there
have
to
be
inner
lines
of
cruisers
scouts
and
destroyers
and
quick
concentration
takes
longer
owing
to
the
greater
space
covered
by
the
blockading
force
and
more
ships
of
all
natures
are
required
for
the
same
reason
greater
and
more
vigilance
are
required
than
in
former
days
because
the
enemy
ships
can
come
out
regardless
of
weather
thick
weather
would
be
their
opportunity
and
it
is
most
important
that
not
a
single
craft
from
a
battleship
to
a
torpedo
boat
be
allowed
to
escape
this
method
of
blockade
includes
the
commercial
blockade
and
all
countries
would
be
informed
of
its
having
been
established
to
prevent
floating
commerce
from
entering
or
leaving
the
blockaded
harbour
the
blockading
force
would
not
be
powerful
enough
to
prevent
a
squadron
of
battleships
or
cruisers
from
entering
or
leaving
the
port
blockaded
and
it
would
not
be
instituted
outside
a
fortified
military
port
or
one
containing
a
strong
naval
force
but
it
would
be
able
to
stop
scouts
and
torpedo
craft
from
entering
or
emerging
unless
in
very
great
numbers
and
if
unable
to
stop
them
from
emerging
would
give
warning
of
their
escape
and
the
direction
in
which
they
are
going
in
both
these
forms
of
blockade
it
is
usual
as
a
matter
of
courtesy
to
allow
neutral
armed
ships
belonging
to
foreign
navies
to
enter
and
leave
for
their
own
purposes
presumably
connected
with
the
subjects
of
their
own
country
who
are
in
the
blockaded
port
this
however
is
not
a
right
and
the
country
to
which
the
blockading
ships
belong
has
a
right
to
refuse
it
and
to
back
her
refusal
by
force
all
countries
must
be
notified
of
a
properly
instituted
commercial
blockade
in
accordance
with
international
agreement
a
this
with
its
subsidiary
operations
should
be
conducted
in
such
a
way
as
to
induce
the
enemy
to
put
to
sea
the
object
of
observing
the
port
being
primarily
a
naval
one
to
bring
him
to
decisive
action
the
principal
observing
force
consisting
of
battleships
and
cruisers
would
be
either
in
one
squadron
or
more
provided
that
they
were
in
supporting
reach
of
each
other
and
so
placed
as
to
be
able
to
cut
off
the
enemy
fleet
on
emerging
from
the
port
observed
before
it
can
get
dangerously
near
its
probable
objective
and
yet
sufficiently
far
out
to
ensure
a
battle
before
it
can
regain
the
shelter
of
its
own
ports
it
is
also
worth
noting
that
the
battle
should
if
possible
be
fought
so
as
to
make
it
difficult
for
the
enemy
damaged
ships
to
obtain
the
shelter
of
a
friendly
neutral
harbours
before
being
captured
the
observed
port
must
be
watched
closely
so
that
immediate
notice
of
the
enemy
exit
may
be
given
and
this
would
be
done
by
small
cruisers
scouts
and
destroyers
which
should
be
strong
and
numerous
enough
to
attack
any
torpedo
craft
trying
to
get
to
sea
in
order
to
induce
the
enemy
main
force
to
put
to
sea
it
is
important
that
every
means
be
used
to
prevent
his
knowing
that
our
fleet
is
observing
the
port
or
if
that
be
impossible
to
do
nothing
which
will
lead
him
to
suppose
that
his
port
is
being
observed
this
operation
is
not
a
blockade
subsidiary
operations
to
induce
the
enemy
fleet
to
put
to
sea
may
take
the
form
of
a
diversion
on
the
enemy
coast
or
against
some
important
part
of
his
trade
either
by
the
observing
fleet
or
by
a
force
affiliated
to
it
or
by
any
oversea
movements
calculated
to
interfere
seriously
with
the
enemy
war
plan
the
guiding
feature
of
modern
preparation
for
war
is
to
be
ready
for
rapid
action
it
is
true
at
sea
more
even
than
on
land
that
upon
the
first
movements
depend
the
initiative
the
power
of
controlling
the
strategy
and
of
making
him
conform
to
our
movements
this
readiness
for
rapid
action
will
depend
on
a
proper
distribution
of
the
fleet
so
as
to
meet
all
the
requirements
the
distribution
of
the
fleet
should
be
dominated
by
the
idea
of
concentration
but
it
must
be
understood
clearly
what
concentration
means
clausewitz
says
the
best
strategy
is
always
to
be
sufficiently
strong
at
first
generally
then
at
the
decisive
point
there
is
therefore
no
higher
or
simpler
law
for
strategy
than
this
keep
your
forces
together
the
maxim
keep
your
forces
together
does
not
however
necessarily
mean
keeping
them
all
concentrated
in
one
mass
but
rather
keeping
them
so
disposed
that
they
can
unite
readily
at
will
at
sea
it
is
more
difficult
than
on
land
to
foretell
where
the
decisive
point
will
be
but
since
it
is
quicker
and
easier
at
sea
to
concentrate
forces
at
any
particular
point
than
on
land
in
applying
this
maxim
for
our
purposes
the
rule
should
be
to
dispose
the
forces
at
sea
so
as
to
be
able
to
concentrate
them
in
time
at
the
decisive
point
so
soon
as
this
point
is
determined
and
also
so
as
to
conceal
from
the
enemy
what
it
is
intended
to
make
the
decisive
point
if
the
forces
are
rightly
disposed
within
due
limits
adequate
control
of
all
the
lines
of
passage
and
communication
can
be
assured
and
if
the
enemy
undertakes
any
operations
it
should
be
possible
to
ensure
that
sufficient
forces
can
be
concentrated
in
time
to
defeat
his
object
on
the
other
hand
if
the
forces
are
concentrated
in
one
mass
there
can
be
little
chance
of
deceiving
or
confusing
the
enemy
while
it
gives
him
an
opportunity
of
successfully
carrying
out
some
operation
by
evasion
the
peculiarity
of
maritime
communications
since
the
whole
idea
of
command
of
the
sea
rests
on
the
control
of
communications
it
can
not
be
fully
apprehended
without
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
nature
of
maritime
communications
ashore
the
respective
lines
of
communications
of
each
belligerent
tend
as
a
rule
to
run
more
or
less
approximately
in
opposite
directions
until
they
meet
in
the
theatre
of
operations
or
the
objective
point
at
sea
the
reverse
is
frequently
the
case
for
in
maritime
warfare
the
great
lines
of
communications
of
either
belligerent
often
tend
to
run
approximately
parallel
if
indeed
they
are
not
identical
thus
in
the
case
of
a
war
with
germany
the
object
of
which
lay
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
or
in
america
or
south
africa
our
respective
lines
of
communication
would
be
identical
this
was
also
the
case
in
all
our
imperial
wars
with
france
peculiarity
is
the
controlling
influence
of
maritime
nearly
all
our
current
maxims
of
naval
strategy
can
be
traced
to
the
pressure
it
exerts
on
naval
thought
it
is
at
the
root
of
the
fundamental
difference
between
military
and
naval
strategy
and
affords
the
explanation
of
much
strategical
error
and
confusion
which
have
arisen
from
applying
the
principles
of
land
warfare
to
the
sea
without
allowing
for
the
antagonistic
conditions
of
the
communications
and
the
operations
against
them
in
each
case
on
land
the
chief
reason
for
not
always
striking
the
communications
at
once
is
that
as
a
rule
we
can
not
do
so
without
exposing
our
own
at
sea
on
the
contrary
when
the
great
lines
are
common
to
both
we
can
not
defend
our
own
without
striking
at
the
enemy
therefore
at
sea
the
obvious
opening
is
to
get
our
fleet
into
such
a
position
that
it
controls
the
common
lines
unless
defeated
or
evaded
this
was
usually
done
in
our
old
wars
with
france
by
our
attempting
to
get
a
fleet
off
brest
before
the
french
could
sail
hence
the
maxims
that
the
proper
place
for
our
fleets
is
off
the
coast
the
enemy
coast
is
our
true
frontier
and
the
like
but
these
maxims
are
not
universally
true
witness
togo
strategy
against
rojesvensky
when
he
remained
correctly
upon
his
own
coast
take
again
the
maxim
that
the
primary
object
of
the
fleet
is
to
seek
out
the
enemy
fleet
and
destroy
it
here
again
togo
practice
was
the
reverse
of
the
maxim
the
true
maxim
is
the
primary
object
of
the
fleet
is
to
secure
communications
and
if
the
enemy
fleet
is
in
a
position
to
render
them
unsafe
it
must
be
put
out
of
action
the
enemy
fleet
usually
is
in
this
position
but
not
always
opening
of
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
the
operations
of
were
to
secure
some
point
cadiz
gibraltar
or
ferrol
on
the
spanish
trade
communications
the
french
lateral
communications
and
our
own
lines
of
passage
to
the
mediterranean
where
was
to
be
our
chief
theatre
of
operation
these
last
two
lines
were
identical
in
the
chief
operations
had
for
their
object
to
secure
the
alliance
of
savoy
and
particularly
of
portugal
rooke
official
instructions
directed
that
the
french
fleet
was
to
be
ignored
unless
it
threatened
the
common
communications
by
we
had
gained
a
naval
position
from
which
france
could
not
eject
us
and
she
abandoned
the
struggle
for
sea
communications
but
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
maxim
of
seeking
out
the
enemy
fleet
is
sound
and
applicable
a
because
for
us
permanent
is
usually
essential
to
ultimate
success
and
this
can
not
be
obtained
without
destroying
the
enemy
fleet
b
because
usually
the
enemy
fleet
opens
with
an
attempt
to
the
control
of
the
common
c
because
usually
the
functions
of
the
fleet
are
so
complex
the
calls
upon
it
so
numerous
that
it
will
seek
to
strike
a
blow
which
will
solve
all
the
difficulties
sir
palmes
fairborne
solution
of
the
problem
in
also
it
must
be
remembered
that
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
most
effective
way
of
seeking
out
the
enemy
fleet
forcing
an
action
on
him
is
to
seize
a
position
which
controls
communications
vital
to
his
plan
of
campaign
this
was
what
happened
in
rooke
was
unable
to
seek
out
the
toulon
fleet
but
by
seizing
gibraltar
he
made
it
come
to
him
not
intentionally
but
by
the
operation
of
strategical
law
practically
all
great
naval
actions
have
been
brought
about
in
this
way
that
is
they
have
been
the
outcome
of
an
effort
to
clear
essential
communications
from
the
enemy
fleet
gravelines
la
hogue
quiberon
trafalgar
tsushima
similarly
the
great
actions
of
the
old
dutch
wars
were
brought
about
because
our
geographical
position
placed
us
astride
the
dutch
trade
communications
and
they
were
forced
to
seek
a
decision
against
our
fleet
in
applying
the
maxim
of
seeking
out
the
enemy
fleet
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
if
you
seek
it
out
with
a
superior
force
you
will
probably
find
it
in
a
place
where
you
can
not
destroy
it
except
at
very
heavy
cost
it
is
far
better
to
make
it
come
to
you
and
this
has
often
been
done
by
merely
sitting
on
the
common
communications
again
if
you
seek
out
the
enemy
fleet
without
being
certain
of
getting
contact
you
may
merely
assist
it
in
evading
you
and
enable
it
to
get
into
a
position
on
your
own
communications
from
which
it
may
be
very
costly
to
dislodge
it
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
elizabethan
government
kept
the
fleet
in
home
waters
in
sampson
in
the
war
was
actually
permitted
to
make
this
mistake
by
going
to
seek
out
cervera
without
being
sure
of
contact
he
left
him
a
clear
run
into
cienfuegos
or
even
havana
which
it
was
the
main
function
of
the
fleet
to
prevent
captain
mahan
has
since
modified
this
maxim
as
follows
seek
out
the
enemy
fleet
if
you
are
sure
of
getting
contact
a
truer
maxim
would
seem
to
be
seek
contact
with
the
enemy
fleet
in
the
most
certain
and
favourable
manner
that
is
open
to
you
to
seek
out
the
enemy
fleet
is
only
one
way
of
doing
this
and
not
always
the
best
way
it
must
be
remembered
that
other
conditions
being
equal
it
is
an
obvious
advantage
to
fight
in
your
own
waters
rather
than
in
those
of
the
enemy
and
more
likely
to
ensure
that
a
defeat
of
the
enemy
will
be
decisive
